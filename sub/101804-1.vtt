01:37.195 --> 01:38.897
Hello, can I speak
to Sandra please?

01:38.930 --> 01:40.465
<i>Speaking.</i>

01:40.498 --> 01:42.301
Hello there, Sandra,
this is Simon.

01:42.334 --> 01:44.871
I'm the Promotional Manager
at Studio 55.

01:44.903 --> 01:46.738
I understand you spoke to one
of my colleagues recently

01:46.772 --> 01:48.475
about a competition
we're running.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.210
<i>OK, yeah.</i>

01:52.243 --> 01:53.712
Yeah, Sandra, do you work?

01:53.912 --> 01:55.347
<i>Yeah. Yeah, why?</i>

01:55.381 --> 01:57.716
That's fine, actually,
do you know what, Sandra?

01:57.750 --> 01:59.185
I'm gonna give you
these tickets.

01:59.218 --> 02:01.853
You've just won a free
VIP day out with us.

02:01.887 --> 02:03.623
- <i>Doing what?</i>
- You are going to meet

02:03.656 --> 02:06.459
one of the best professional
hairstylists in London.

02:06.492 --> 02:08.259
You will also meet
a make-up artist

02:08.294 --> 02:09.662
and have a free makeover

02:09.693 --> 02:10.895
and at the end of the day

02:10.930 --> 02:12.932
you will have
a fantastic photoshoot.

02:12.965 --> 02:15.200
<i>I really don't think
that's for me, love.</i>

02:15.533 --> 02:17.269
No, you don't understand,
Sandra.

02:17.302 --> 02:18.603
It's free, you've won it.

02:18.637 --> 02:20.473
<i>Yeah, no, I'm not interested.</i>

02:20.506 --> 02:22.574
Come on, there's even free
bubbly when you get here.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.944
Oh, and you know,
bring a few changes of outfit

02:24.977 --> 02:26.479
obviously not
your whole wardrobe!

02:27.913 --> 02:31.250
<i>Yeah, I suppose a day out
down in London would be nice.</i>

02:31.282 --> 02:33.685
So can you tell me,
is it a Visa, master

02:33.718 --> 02:35.287
or debit card
you'll be using today?

02:35.320 --> 02:36.455
<i>Sorry?</i>

02:37.590 --> 02:39.457
For the deposit. What kind
of card will you be using?

02:39.491 --> 02:42.395
<i>Sorry, er, what deposit?
You just said it was free.</i>

02:42.561 --> 02:44.564
Oh no, sorry, Sandra,
you've got the wrong idea.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.199
It's not any money at all.

02:46.231 --> 02:48.668
All our... all our services
are complimentary.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.569
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- We just take a deposit

02:50.603 --> 02:51.837
- so you turn up...
- <i>OK.</i>

02:51.870 --> 02:53.973
...but you get it straight back
on the day.

02:54.006 --> 02:55.640
Can you give me
the long number across

02:55.674 --> 02:57.576
- the front of the card please?
- <i>Um, OK, right.</i>

02:57.610 --> 02:59.478
<i>Just need to find my bag,
hold on a second</i>

02:59.510 --> 03:00.712
<i>just bear with me.</i>

03:01.247 --> 03:02.549
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

03:03.414 --> 03:04.449
- Got it? Brilliant.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

03:04.483 --> 03:05.818
OK, so it's just
that long number

03:05.850 --> 03:07.453
across the front of the card,
that'll be great

03:07.485 --> 03:08.687
then we can process this.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.522
It'll go through,
you'll have a fabulous time.

03:10.556 --> 03:12.959
<i>Hold on a second. I think
someone's at the door, y'know.</i>

03:12.991 --> 03:14.227
Oh, right, well,
I tell you what...

03:14.259 --> 03:15.860
- <i>Sorry, Simon, I have got to go.</i>
- I really don't...

03:15.894 --> 03:17.462
<i>Think it's important actually.</i>

03:17.496 --> 03:19.564
Can I say something to you?
Can I say something?

03:19.598 --> 03:20.833
Before you go,
just last thing, right?

03:20.866 --> 03:22.268
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You know sometimes

03:22.300 --> 03:23.602
- you want things in life?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

03:23.635 --> 03:25.003
And you just put them off,
you put them off

03:25.037 --> 03:26.838
you sit on the wall...

03:26.872 --> 03:28.674
Right, I'm just saying,
jump off the wall.

03:28.706 --> 03:29.775
<i>There goes the door again.</i>

03:29.807 --> 03:30.942
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Jump off the wall.

03:30.975 --> 03:32.010
Just take the plunge...

03:32.044 --> 03:33.879
<i>I've gotta go and answer
the door, OK?</i>

03:33.912 --> 03:35.480
...life-changing experience
for you.

03:35.514 --> 03:36.682
<i>I know, I know.</i>

03:36.715 --> 03:38.317
Put a date in now,
if you decide later on

03:38.349 --> 03:40.019
you want to rearrange it
then that's no problem

03:40.051 --> 03:41.653
you can just give me
a ring back.

03:41.687 --> 03:42.855
<i>I'll call you back,
alright, Simon?</i>

03:42.888 --> 03:44.657
- <i>Bye, bye.</i>
- Hello? Hello? Ah...

03:44.889 --> 03:45.724
Fuck!

03:46.457 --> 03:47.526
Fuck.

03:49.027 --> 03:50.329
Fuck.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.620
Alright?

04:47.653 --> 04:48.854
Yeah.

04:48.887 --> 04:49.855
Good day?

04:50.122 --> 04:52.025
No, really fucking awful.

04:53.925 --> 04:54.993
Oh, well.

04:56.562 --> 04:57.797
You fancy a top-up?

04:58.463 --> 05:00.533
Oh, go on then. Twist my arm.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.522
That is lovely.

05:26.391 --> 05:27.927
How was your day then? Good?

05:28.826 --> 05:29.594
OK.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.370
I looked at jobs
back in London again.

05:37.903 --> 05:38.771
Oh, really?

05:39.404 --> 05:40.972
I thought you were happy here.

05:41.406 --> 05:42.808
It's not challenging anymore.

05:43.742 --> 05:45.545
I'm not getting anywhere
staying up here.

05:47.812 --> 05:48.714
Yeah, well.

05:50.014 --> 05:51.384
Let's see how it goes, eh?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.855
It's never a good time to talk,
is it?

05:57.689 --> 05:59.125
You're never interested
in talking.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.893
You're happy
just to drift aimlessly.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.094
Can we start again?

06:03.295 --> 06:05.730
Fucking hell, Sarah, I've had
a really crap day at work.

06:05.764 --> 06:07.600
I've been in the door
five minutes and you're on me!

06:07.632 --> 06:10.502
I don't care.
Get a different job.

06:11.002 --> 06:13.406
You hate it there but you're
happy to moan and groan

06:13.439 --> 06:15.074
instead of changing it.
You're pathetic.

06:16.841 --> 06:17.843
Pathetic...

06:24.583 --> 06:25.718
Yeah, that's right,
say your bit

06:25.750 --> 06:27.387
and then disappear
for the night.

06:53.177 --> 06:55.014
Fancy Chinese? I'll order.

06:56.148 --> 06:57.550
Some duck and pancakes?

06:58.182 --> 06:59.519
Lovey bottle of cold wine.

07:00.985 --> 07:01.786
Whatever.

07:05.189 --> 07:07.427
Look, I'm really sorry
about earlier.

07:09.661 --> 07:11.663
I do care.
I just get stressed, is all.

07:11.697 --> 07:12.331
I just...

07:14.031 --> 07:15.634
I need some support from you.

07:17.235 --> 07:18.837
I feel like
I'm on my own sometimes.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.908
I get it. I understand.

07:24.776 --> 07:25.778
I'll go and order.

07:26.177 --> 07:27.612
Anything else you want?

08:28.574 --> 08:30.610
OK. The five steps.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.913
Number one, fear of loss.

08:34.879 --> 08:37.216
Fear of loss is greater
than the need for gain.

08:38.616 --> 08:41.285
Number two, sense of urgency.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.990
You must create an urgency
to buy today.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.692
People will buy on impulse...

08:48.759 --> 08:51.797
only if you get them excited
about what you're fucking doing.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.065
He can't get 'em excited,
can he?

08:53.097 --> 08:54.266
Shush.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.035
Number three...

08:58.102 --> 09:00.739
Jones effect,
keeping up with.

09:02.374 --> 09:03.543
Number four...

09:04.375 --> 09:06.111
indifference.

09:06.945 --> 09:09.282
Never appear desperate
for a sale.

09:10.182 --> 09:13.786
If you do, they become sceptical
and will not buy.

09:15.019 --> 09:16.054
Listen to me.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.789
Listening.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.258
Number five.

09:21.793 --> 09:22.695
Greed.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.300
They want more for less.

09:29.234 --> 09:30.570
Make out to give it to them.

09:32.203 --> 09:34.940
OK. That's your lot for today.

09:35.941 --> 09:38.777
Remember, these seats
and phones are loaned

09:38.809 --> 09:40.211
to you on a daily basis.

09:41.178 --> 09:42.914
Earn your seat every day.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.050
Please. Own your seat.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.653
- Come on.
- Come on!

09:53.125 --> 09:54.860
OK, before you pick up
the phones

09:54.893 --> 09:56.128
I want to talk about today.

09:57.294 --> 09:58.697
Today is a new day, right?

09:59.130 --> 10:01.165
- Yep.
- Whatever problems you had

10:01.198 --> 10:03.635
yesterday or the day before,
for that matter, they've gone.

10:03.668 --> 10:05.136
<i>Finito.</i>

10:06.772 --> 10:09.074
Now, I know I speak
for Alan here when I say

10:09.106 --> 10:10.842
this really isn't
rocket science.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.979
Just focus on your leads,
and dream big.

10:15.279 --> 10:18.283
Reach those goals and you'll be
living the dream, my friends.

10:19.817 --> 10:21.953
Just don't forget,
turn up with no make-up on.

10:22.287 --> 10:24.757
Yeah, but your clothes. Lovely.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.892
Right, thank you, Caroline,
it's been a pleasure.

10:26.924 --> 10:27.859
Take care. Bye-bye.

10:44.142 --> 10:45.344
Get in there!

11:16.441 --> 11:17.375
Jesus.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.345
It's Action Man.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.417
I'm thinking of joining the gym.

11:25.082 --> 11:26.217
Oh, really?

11:26.518 --> 11:29.120
Oh... I like your wobbly bits.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.124
I'm serious. I'm gonna go
first thing in the morning.

11:33.892 --> 11:36.262
You do need to tone up a bit.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.196
Won't take me long
to get into shape.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.298
I'll believe it when I see it.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.267
Thanks for your support.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.370
Anytime, cowboy.

11:51.442 --> 11:52.377
Oh, no.

12:07.292 --> 12:09.161
Hiya. I'd like to join the gym.

12:13.331 --> 12:15.000
You had any kind of experience?

12:16.301 --> 12:17.269
In what way?

12:19.236 --> 12:20.305
Have you trained before?

12:22.206 --> 12:23.274
Years ago.

12:25.910 --> 12:26.778
Years ago.

12:27.578 --> 12:28.880
When I was a kid.

12:30.347 --> 12:31.282
Teenager.

12:34.085 --> 12:35.153
Where?

12:37.221 --> 12:38.323
Lime Boys Club.

12:42.259 --> 12:43.528
Why don't you go back there?

12:46.431 --> 12:47.432
It's in London.

12:57.008 --> 12:58.277
This gym ain't for you, mate.

12:59.878 --> 13:01.280
Get yourself a YMCA.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.116
Take your Lycra pants with you.

13:09.386 --> 13:10.421
I wanna train here.

13:30.642 --> 13:31.977
Sign you up then.

13:56.301 --> 13:57.970
Go on. Hold you up.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.272
Easy.

14:50.455 --> 14:52.224
Oi, oi, you don't fucking
do it like that.

14:52.256 --> 14:53.991
What's the matter with ya?

14:54.024 --> 14:56.294
No one's done a pull-down
like that since the '90s.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.629
I'm sorry, no one showed me
how to work it.

14:58.663 --> 15:00.065
What's your game?

15:00.565 --> 15:01.934
I said I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

15:03.201 --> 15:04.903
I ain't seen you in here before,
have I?

15:05.370 --> 15:06.371
Just joined.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.341
Welcome. Terry.

15:10.674 --> 15:11.676
Hi, I'm Simon.

15:12.243 --> 15:13.345
So what's the goal then?

15:14.745 --> 15:16.548
Well, I really just want
to get fit.

15:16.581 --> 15:18.984
Fit? Well, you can fuck fit.

15:19.317 --> 15:21.153
You wanna get big
and you wanna get strong.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.687
And the way you're pulling
that weight about

15:22.721 --> 15:24.188
you'll end up a cripple.

15:24.221 --> 15:25.957
You'll be a Thalidomide
by the time you're 50.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.558
- A what?
- A flid.

15:29.394 --> 15:30.663
But don't worry...

15:31.495 --> 15:33.465
because I can prevent that
from happening.

15:33.764 --> 15:35.167
Are you expensive?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.336
Oh, please, the money
should not be important.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.272
Look, I'm standing here now...

15:41.272 --> 15:42.508
and I'm looking at you.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.076
And I can see major potential.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.346
You just need a little bit
of guidance, that's all.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.581
You ever thought
about competing?

15:51.349 --> 15:52.384
No.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.586
- You could be a Mister.
- A Mister?

15:55.787 --> 15:58.157
Bodybuilding. Mister Newcastle,
Mister England.

16:00.658 --> 16:01.826
Mister South Shields.

16:04.162 --> 16:08.000
I'm not really into all that
high-intensity bootcamp stuff.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.601
Bootcamp, who said anything
about fucking soppy bootcamp?

16:10.634 --> 16:12.571
I was in the Army
for 15 years, mate.

16:13.337 --> 16:15.473
And what I do is better
than all that old bollocks.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.376
And I'm a lot fucking cheaper.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.480
Alright. Can I think about it?

16:21.513 --> 16:23.182
You can do whatever you want.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.316
I'm here every day.

16:27.485 --> 16:28.988
Come on, you cunts!

16:30.154 --> 16:31.289
Come on!

16:49.307 --> 16:50.308
Alright, Gail?

16:53.110 --> 16:54.812
- D'you want a pint?
- Yeah.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.313
Two pints please, Gail.

16:56.346 --> 16:57.314
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

16:58.216 --> 17:00.351
Fancy going to Holland
and Barrett after this?

17:01.519 --> 17:03.489
- Where?
- Health food shop.

17:04.489 --> 17:06.090
Have you run out of Bombay mix?

17:07.525 --> 17:10.061
I've joined a gym,
I need to get some supplies.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.563
Fuck off, you fucking poof.

17:12.163 --> 17:14.633
Need to get healthy,
all we do is booze every day.

17:14.665 --> 17:17.300
I've got no energy anymore.
I feel lethargic all the time.

17:17.335 --> 17:19.038
- I feel old, man.
- Take some coke.

17:20.538 --> 17:21.539
Don't you worry?

17:22.507 --> 17:23.674
I just don't feel
the same anymore.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.544
I wanna try
and shake it up a bit.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.078
I wanna change myself.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.647
Like I said,
coke always worked for me.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.783
No, I wanna give
other stuff a go.

17:33.884 --> 17:35.453
Steroids?

17:36.354 --> 17:37.355
No.

17:37.821 --> 17:39.190
Supplements.

17:39.223 --> 17:40.491
You know what I mean.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.715
- Strawberry for me.
- Strawberry?

19:11.749 --> 19:12.884
Yeah.

19:12.916 --> 19:15.253
I got the fucking
head bouncer...

19:15.686 --> 19:18.189
big horrible spade
in a fucking headlock.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.957
- Did you smash the fucker up?
- No, that was later.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.425
So I fucking got him
round the neck

19:21.459 --> 19:22.928
and wanna make him feel
a bit fucking giddy

19:22.961 --> 19:24.496
a little bit sick.

19:24.528 --> 19:26.865
So I'm fucking swinging the cunt
round like a rag doll

19:26.897 --> 19:28.533
I went fucking ballistic.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.368
I pulled the cunt up and gone,
crack! With a left hook.

19:31.402 --> 19:32.636
He's gone down like
a fucking sack of shit

19:32.670 --> 19:34.339
and I'm stamping all over him.

19:34.372 --> 19:35.673
Spark out?
- Yeah.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.776
And all his fucking horrible
muggy doorman mates

19:37.808 --> 19:38.976
were fucking standing there
like that.

19:39.009 --> 19:41.512
Fucking, not one of them

19:41.546 --> 19:43.615
helped that horrible, fat,
black cunt out.

19:43.647 --> 19:45.382
Shit.
- Fortnight later...

19:45.415 --> 19:47.351
I thought, "Fuck it,
I'll go back in there."

19:47.384 --> 19:49.820
They're all around me,
free drinks, fucking birds.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.823
Manager comes up to me,
"Tel, Tel!

19:51.855 --> 19:53.791
Please take over the door!

19:54.826 --> 19:57.461
Take over the door!"
I mean, fuck off, you dope.

19:57.494 --> 19:59.396
It's a fucking cunt's game.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.466
Definitely, mate.
- Talk later, alright?

20:01.499 --> 20:02.768
- See you, Tel.
- Take care.

20:04.001 --> 20:05.604
Well, there he is.

20:06.403 --> 20:07.338
Oh, hi, Terry.

20:08.306 --> 20:10.342
So, you ready then?

20:12.376 --> 20:13.377
How's it gonna work?

20:14.645 --> 20:16.248
Let's have a proper look at ya.

20:17.448 --> 20:19.518
Come over to the mirror
and take your top off.

20:19.851 --> 20:20.819
Come on.

20:21.919 --> 20:23.455
Is that really necessary?

20:23.488 --> 20:24.855
Yes, it is, we need to see
what we're dealing with

20:24.888 --> 20:26.557
what we're up against

20:26.590 --> 20:28.359
all the hard work we've got
ahead of us. Just take it off.

20:41.071 --> 20:43.507
Yeah, I don't like this
kind of thing, to be honest.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.042
Fuck off, I'm teasing with ya.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.578
Look, Simon,
I can transform you

20:47.612 --> 20:49.480
like you can't believe.

20:49.513 --> 20:50.981
But you're gonna
have to toughen up a bit.

20:51.015 --> 20:52.818
Yeah, I know,
that's why I come to the gym.

20:53.951 --> 20:56.755
You know what?
Let's leave it for today.

20:57.521 --> 20:59.390
But I'm here now,
I came to train today.

20:59.423 --> 21:01.393
Yeah, I know you're
fucking here, I can see ya

21:01.425 --> 21:03.794
but you've gone all fucking
negative on me, ain't ya?

21:03.827 --> 21:05.430
You're not in the right
fucking mindset.

21:08.432 --> 21:10.368
I'll see you tomorrow. Alright?

21:12.603 --> 21:13.538
I don't know
if I can do tomorrow.

21:14.771 --> 21:17.475
Well, if you can't, you can't,
no harm done.

21:24.414 --> 21:25.549
He had me take my top off.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.385
I felt abused.

21:28.419 --> 21:30.288
Well, you don't need
to go back, do you?

21:32.690 --> 21:34.692
I've paid six months
upfront now.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.428
What! Why?

21:41.432 --> 21:42.968
Maybe it's a character test...

21:43.634 --> 21:44.801
and then he'll be fine.

21:45.769 --> 21:48.605
He's just seeing if I'll turn up
again, if I have the balls.

21:48.638 --> 21:49.840
I mean, they're like that.

21:50.575 --> 21:51.910
He's ex-Army, you know.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.012
Sounds like a smashing bloke.

21:56.547 --> 21:57.582
Hope you're hungry.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.384
Do you want some cheese?

22:31.415 --> 22:33.951
Sort yourself out.

22:36.119 --> 22:37.455
And do it now.

23:04.615 --> 23:06.183
D'you know what
drives me mad about her?

23:06.217 --> 23:08.086
She's so far up his fucking arse

23:08.118 --> 23:10.521
that her fucking feet
are dangling just out.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.458
When he's doing
his fucking splurge

23:13.657 --> 23:16.026
at the beginning of the day,
it's always geared to us.

23:16.059 --> 23:17.729
Never geared to her, is it?

23:17.761 --> 23:18.896
It never is, though!

23:18.930 --> 23:20.932
"Today's a new day, guys, um...

23:20.964 --> 23:23.534
I'll be able to stop my hands
once I've taken them out

23:23.567 --> 23:26.171
of Alan's arse, yeah?" Idiot.

23:26.971 --> 23:28.705
She gets away
with fucking murder.

23:28.739 --> 23:30.942
- She's good though.
- She's not good at all!

23:30.974 --> 23:32.443
She's got more sales than you.

23:32.477 --> 23:33.845
She hasn't got
any fucking sales.

23:33.877 --> 23:36.013
Exactly, that's more than you!

23:36.047 --> 23:38.048
She can't even fucking read
the digits back to 'em

23:38.082 --> 23:39.851
on the fucking card.

23:39.884 --> 23:42.621
This has got to stop as well.

23:43.019 --> 23:45.155
Oh, change the fucking record.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.558
Couple of pints
aren't gonna hurt, are they?

23:47.592 --> 23:49.694
- Too many carbs.
- So what?

23:49.727 --> 23:51.162
You fucking need it
after being stuck

23:51.194 --> 23:52.931
in that fucking place all day.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.200
What happened, Ron?

23:55.599 --> 23:57.568
Did you ever think you
would end up like this?

24:00.637 --> 24:01.906
At least we have
a bit of craic.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.708
Fucking hate sales.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.078
Sales is my life.

25:32.063 --> 25:35.000
Oi! What time do you call this?

25:35.599 --> 25:36.867
Yeah, sorry I'm a bit late.

25:38.001 --> 25:39.903
Oh, you've had a late one,
ain't ya?

25:39.936 --> 25:42.206
Oh, fuck me, you stink.
What you been eating, shit?

25:42.873 --> 25:44.342
Had a couple after work,
that's all.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.977
Yeah?

25:46.009 --> 25:48.212
Well, that's gonna have to stop
if you wanna get serious.

25:48.645 --> 25:50.615
I'm cutting down,
the training will help.

25:50.647 --> 25:53.317
No, no, no, stop,
altogether I said.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.954
- OK.
- Go and get yourself warmed up.

26:10.934 --> 26:12.369
Bring that into
the top of your chest.

26:12.403 --> 26:14.605
When you come down, squeeze.

26:14.638 --> 26:15.806
- Squeeze what?
- Elbows back.

26:15.839 --> 26:17.074
- This.
- Like that?

26:17.107 --> 26:19.644
Yeah, but bring
your elbows back, that's it.

26:19.676 --> 26:22.313
Up again. Good, back two, good.

26:23.647 --> 26:24.749
Three, good.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.653
Four, good, that's it.

26:28.919 --> 26:30.221
Five, good...

26:31.021 --> 26:32.723
Six, that's good.

26:33.324 --> 26:35.727
That's good, seven,
come on, I'm impressed.

26:35.759 --> 26:37.295
All we're doing
is getting the form correct

26:37.327 --> 26:39.963
so you learn to do everything
the right fucking way

26:39.997 --> 26:41.766
- and not the wrong way.
- OK.

26:41.798 --> 26:43.233
It's easy to do things
the wrong way.

26:43.968 --> 26:45.836
- So, what, is that right?
- That's it, it's fine.

26:45.869 --> 26:47.204
But I want these arms straight

26:47.238 --> 26:49.007
I want you to squeeze
them triceps.

26:49.306 --> 26:50.942
That's it, that's better.

26:50.974 --> 26:52.142
OK, got it.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.378
Stand up straight,
chin up, look forward.

26:54.412 --> 26:56.615
- Bum out?
- No, bum in.

26:57.248 --> 26:59.784
Stretch them arms out,
now come up, curl it.

27:00.217 --> 27:02.220
Come up to the top. Oh, slow...

27:02.252 --> 27:04.221
Like a lunatic.
What's the matter with ya?

27:06.057 --> 27:08.759
That's it, nice and easy,
and squeeze at the top.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.360
Squeeze them biceps, squeeze.

27:10.394 --> 27:12.896
- Oh, what... Oh, right.
- When you get to the top

27:12.930 --> 27:15.099
I want you to count for one,
and squeeze.

27:15.132 --> 27:17.001
- One.
- That's it, that's it.

27:17.801 --> 27:19.436
- One.
- That's it, one, that's it.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.038
That's it, see?
You're fucking...

27:21.071 --> 27:22.406
You're taking notice, son,
I like it.

28:00.911 --> 28:01.946
Sarah...

28:03.079 --> 28:04.214
are you awake?

28:29.006 --> 28:31.342
Yeah, hopefully I do see you
there but have a fantastic time.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.242
That's another one.

28:33.109 --> 28:34.478
Thank you. Bye, bye.

28:35.011 --> 28:37.381
Woo!

28:38.015 --> 28:39.383
Got another one.

28:39.415 --> 28:40.417
Woo!

28:42.385 --> 28:44.321
Good.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.457
That's all you.
I want one more, one more!

28:46.490 --> 28:48.293
Come on, come on,
come on, down...

28:48.893 --> 28:52.163
And drive, come on, push, push,
push, push, push, push, good!

28:53.364 --> 28:56.433
Good. Well done.
Come on, get up.

29:02.306 --> 29:03.408
Are you alright?

29:05.041 --> 29:06.211
Yeah...

29:07.076 --> 29:09.780
just tired, the gym
is knocking me for six.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.249
You look like a mong.

29:12.215 --> 29:13.484
Thanks.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.285
You want some gnocchi?

29:15.486 --> 29:17.489
- No, ta.
- Why not? I'm doing some.

29:18.321 --> 29:21.391
I've already told you, no carbs
at this time anymore.

29:21.424 --> 29:23.327
Terry said strictly none
after six.

29:24.028 --> 29:25.963
What would Terry like me
to make you then?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.298
I'll do mine in a minute.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.136
Bought a nice tuna steak,
actually.

29:33.237 --> 29:34.939
Gnocchi's not fat.

29:34.971 --> 29:36.907
It's not fat that's the problem.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.376
Terry said there are good fats
and bad fats.

29:39.876 --> 29:41.278
It's carbs
that are the real problem.

29:41.311 --> 29:42.913
Terry says a lot, doesn't he?

29:43.279 --> 29:44.581
All this training you're doing

29:44.615 --> 29:46.317
have you noticed
a difference yet?

29:47.852 --> 29:48.853
Well, haven't you?

30:28.625 --> 30:31.461
Nice and controlled,
stretch it right out, that's it.

30:42.172 --> 30:45.009
Stretch it out... and stretch.

30:51.981 --> 30:55.019
That's it. Squeeze it,
squeeze it, squeeze at the top.

30:56.452 --> 30:58.189
You've literally doubled
the size of your arms

30:58.221 --> 30:59.324
since you started.

31:45.301 --> 31:47.004
Oh, it's really hot
in here today.

31:53.176 --> 31:54.411
You should try Iraq.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.649
Were you there?

31:59.048 --> 32:00.183
Two tours.

32:02.118 --> 32:03.453
Then I went on the circuit.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.424
Like a second home to me.

32:08.992 --> 32:10.193
The circuit, what's that?

32:13.130 --> 32:14.265
Private security.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.435
Bet that was intense.

32:19.336 --> 32:20.570
You have no idea, mate.

32:21.771 --> 32:23.106
No idea.

32:26.042 --> 32:26.977
Tell me?

32:30.547 --> 32:32.482
We opened fire
on small villages and...

32:35.352 --> 32:37.088
never ever batted an eyelid.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.592
I made sure I erased the tapes
on that one.

32:44.361 --> 32:45.496
What do you mean?

32:47.463 --> 32:48.532
I should write a book.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.137
Mind you, I'd get a life
sentence for chapter five alone.

32:56.373 --> 32:58.241
What happened in chapter five?

33:06.215 --> 33:08.585
Remind me to show you
my little "trophy pictures".

33:10.220 --> 33:11.154
You wouldn't believe it.

33:15.092 --> 33:16.694
I'm not sure I wanna see them,
to be honest.

33:21.298 --> 33:23.034
Two elephants fighting
on the grass.

33:24.101 --> 33:25.470
Who gets damaged?

33:26.769 --> 33:28.439
Sorry?

33:28.471 --> 33:32.143
Two big elephants fighting
on the grass, who gets damaged?

33:42.853 --> 33:44.322
The grass.

33:54.730 --> 33:57.035
- Never stop hitting people.
- What?

33:58.335 --> 34:00.505
Never stop hitting people

34:00.703 --> 34:02.173
because once you stop

34:03.707 --> 34:05.443
you will never be able
to start again.

35:12.876 --> 35:14.512
Absolutely!

35:14.545 --> 35:16.180
No, it's been
an absolute pleasure.

35:16.213 --> 35:17.648
Yeah? Have a lovely, lovely day.

35:18.382 --> 35:20.351
OK, fantastic, bye-bye, bye.

35:21.818 --> 35:23.153
Wahey!

35:24.320 --> 35:26.156
We're on a roll, on a roll.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.425
- Alright?
- Great stuff.

35:29.458 --> 35:30.793
Yes...

35:30.827 --> 35:32.196
Hey!

35:32.461 --> 35:34.565
- Oh, is that...
- You can do it!

35:34.965 --> 35:36.534
...top of the board?

35:36.567 --> 35:38.501
Is that top of the board?
I think it is.

35:38.534 --> 35:39.836
I think that's top
of the board.

35:39.869 --> 35:42.172
Ladies and gentleman,
it's top of the board!

35:42.206 --> 35:43.774
Top of the board!

35:43.806 --> 35:44.875
Thank you very much,
thank you.

35:55.251 --> 35:56.387
Hey, coming for a pint?

35:56.420 --> 35:58.422
No, taking Sarah out tonight

35:58.621 --> 36:00.490
to celebrate
breaking my sales record.

36:01.757 --> 36:04.360
Just one pint.
She's not gonna mind, is she?

36:04.393 --> 36:06.363
She will. I'll grab one
with you in the week.

36:18.675 --> 36:19.610
Sarah?

36:26.449 --> 36:27.350
Sarah!

36:42.699 --> 36:44.268
<i>Dear Simon...</i>

36:45.568 --> 36:47.471
<i>for what feels like months now,
I've tried to talk to you</i>

36:47.503 --> 36:48.871
<i>to explain how I was feeling</i>

36:48.905 --> 36:50.740
<i>but you were never there
to listen.</i>

36:51.942 --> 36:54.711
<i>After it happened, you never
wanted to talk about it did you?</i>

36:54.744 --> 36:55.880
<i>Why?</i>

36:56.947 --> 36:58.316
<i>You knew how important
it was for me.</i>

36:59.583 --> 37:01.219
<i>There's no easy way
of saying this.</i>

37:02.518 --> 37:04.688
<i>I detest you, I'm afraid,
I really do.</i>

37:06.623 --> 37:08.726
"It's got so bad that
when I hear your key

37:08.759 --> 37:11.329
turning in the front door,
I feel physically sick.

37:12.596 --> 37:14.998
I drink so much so I don't
have to face you sober.

37:15.865 --> 37:17.568
I make out to be unconscious

37:17.967 --> 37:19.670
so I don't have to face you
at all.

37:20.836 --> 37:21.838
I'm sorry...

37:22.572 --> 37:24.508
but this really is
for the best.

37:25.608 --> 37:27.577
You're not the person
I fell in love with.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.647
I do hope you understand."

37:32.615 --> 37:33.884
Yeah, very sad.

37:34.483 --> 37:36.452
Best cure for depression
I know is lifting.

37:36.485 --> 37:37.654
Come on,
let's step it up a gear.

37:38.387 --> 37:40.257
- That's it.
- Someone else?

37:42.391 --> 37:43.393
No, I don't think so.

37:45.061 --> 37:46.896
I really didn't know
she felt like that.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.032
Look, I wouldn't worry about it.

37:49.932 --> 37:52.769
In a month or so, you're gonna
be ripped like a bastard.

37:53.603 --> 37:54.905
- And you know what?
- What?

37:55.371 --> 37:57.375
She'll come running back
like they always do.

37:58.474 --> 37:59.677
Seemed pretty final to me.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.445
I know,
but the more final it seems

38:02.478 --> 38:04.580
the more chance there is
it'll work out.

38:04.614 --> 38:06.382
That makes no sense.

38:06.416 --> 38:07.785
It's Terry's logic, son.

38:08.085 --> 38:09.720
You've gotta remember something.

38:09.753 --> 38:11.989
I've had more fucking women
than you've had hot dinners.

38:12.356 --> 38:13.658
And in a month...

38:14.423 --> 38:15.826
you're gonna have
a couple of juicy

38:15.858 --> 38:17.661
18-year-olds
wrapped round ya.

38:17.693 --> 38:19.362
No, that's not
what I'm looking for.

38:19.396 --> 38:21.865
Course it is,
it's what we're all looking for.

38:21.898 --> 38:24.535
And then when she comes crawling
back on her hands and knees...

38:25.635 --> 38:27.405
you can tell her
to fuck right off.

38:28.538 --> 38:29.940
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

38:29.972 --> 38:32.076
I mean, we only moved
into that big fucking house

38:32.108 --> 38:33.811
because of her.

38:33.844 --> 38:35.412
She's left me right
in the shit with the bills.

38:35.445 --> 38:36.981
I can't afford
all that on my own.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.551
How many bedrooms you got?

38:41.952 --> 38:43.554
Four, why?

38:43.586 --> 38:45.456
No, no, I'm just, um...

38:46.690 --> 38:48.092
I'm just thinking out loud.

38:52.996 --> 38:54.597
I might have a solution
to your problem.

38:55.398 --> 38:56.567
What?

38:56.867 --> 38:58.669
How would you like me
as your lodger?

38:59.769 --> 39:02.440
- I'm not sure, Terry.
- No, no, no, no, listen.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.376
If I moved in...

39:06.009 --> 39:08.112
could you imagine
how big you'd get?

39:09.045 --> 39:10.748
And to be honest with ya

39:10.780 --> 39:12.615
I gotta be out the place
I'm living anyway.

39:12.916 --> 39:14.719
And I like you, Simon,
I really do.

39:15.851 --> 39:17.653
And I feel that you need
a little bit of company

39:17.686 --> 39:18.989
wrapped round you now.

39:19.021 --> 39:20.458
Bring you out of yourself.

39:21.157 --> 39:22.625
What do you say?

39:22.659 --> 39:23.961
Can I think about it?

39:23.994 --> 39:24.995
Of course you can.

39:26.762 --> 39:28.998
Let's step it up, come on.
Let's do this.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.903
Ten reps, no fucking about.

39:35.070 --> 39:38.041
One, two, three, up,
there we go.

39:39.876 --> 39:40.845
One, good.

39:41.978 --> 39:43.012
Good, good.

39:43.713 --> 39:45.082
Good, three...

39:45.114 --> 39:47.049
Really push like you mean it.

39:47.083 --> 39:48.552
Push like you mean it.

39:48.952 --> 39:51.121
Think of Sarah as she's getting
fucked up the arse

39:51.153 --> 39:52.655
by a stranger.

39:52.688 --> 39:54.157
The fuck are you saying?

39:54.190 --> 39:55.858
Trying to motivate you
to get you angry.

39:55.891 --> 39:57.427
Leave Sarah out of it, will ya?

39:57.460 --> 39:59.096
She hates ya,
you said so yourself.

39:59.128 --> 40:01.063
She's your fucking ex now,
hate her back.

40:01.097 --> 40:03.000
Come on, let's get big
and let's get ripped.

40:03.032 --> 40:04.701
I told you that stuff
in confidence.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.536
I don't want you using
her name around the gym.

40:08.103 --> 40:09.672
I'm heartbroken, man.

40:09.706 --> 40:10.908
Or can't you see that?

40:12.208 --> 40:14.844
Simon, don't fucking walk away,
come back.

40:14.878 --> 40:16.713
Hey, hey! I'm joking.

40:33.563 --> 40:34.530
- This the one, Tel?
- Yeah.

40:34.563 --> 40:35.832
Just bang on the door, Paul.

40:53.782 --> 40:54.918
- Hi.
- Aye-aye.

40:54.951 --> 40:57.021
Don't stand there,
come on, give us a hand.

40:57.586 --> 41:00.724
And, um, where is one's
living quarters, my good man?

41:00.757 --> 41:01.892
Upstairs to the right.

41:01.925 --> 41:02.927
Thank you!

41:05.061 --> 41:07.597
- What's in these boxes, Terry?
- Oh, by the way, we're having

41:07.630 --> 41:09.199
a little housewarming party
tonight.

41:09.231 --> 41:10.666
- Housewarming?
- Yeah.

41:10.699 --> 41:12.101
Few of the boys,
few of the little girls.

41:12.135 --> 41:14.038
Liven you up a little bit,
you know what I mean?

41:15.739 --> 41:16.740
Nice one, son.

41:17.907 --> 41:19.242
Where you going?

41:19.275 --> 41:20.543
Ah, yes...

41:40.063 --> 41:41.231
Alright?

42:30.380 --> 42:33.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Turn it down, Steve. Steve...

42:33.717 --> 42:35.552
Good boy.

42:36.119 --> 42:38.255
Listen, just wanna say
a couple of words.

42:39.121 --> 42:42.224
Firstly, I just wanna thank
everybody for coming tonight

42:42.257 --> 42:45.227
it's so fucking lovely
to see you all, as usual.

42:45.260 --> 42:47.630
And...

42:47.664 --> 42:49.232
Everybody, cos it really
makes a difference

42:49.264 --> 42:51.934
when you throw an invite out
and people show, it's lovely.

42:51.967 --> 42:53.636
Secondly...

42:53.836 --> 42:57.007
I've got a very, very, very
special new pal in my life.

42:57.340 --> 42:59.777
He's an absolutely
genuine geezer.

43:00.242 --> 43:02.179
Absolute diamond,
I love him to death.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.882
And if it weren't for him,
there would be no party tonight.

43:05.914 --> 43:08.217
So I just want to say
a massive thank you

43:08.885 --> 43:12.022
to that very, very, very, very
special man.

43:12.322 --> 43:14.825
Down there, don't fucking
make that face!

43:15.425 --> 43:16.594
Simon!

43:17.393 --> 43:19.596
Simon!

43:19.896 --> 43:21.064
Come on!

43:21.931 --> 43:24.635
Now, everybody join in with me
cos this is from the heart.

43:26.168 --> 43:27.605
Simon!

43:27.903 --> 43:31.275
Simon! Simon! Simon!

43:46.289 --> 43:48.359
Simon, Simon...

45:02.065 --> 45:03.166
Hello?

45:05.235 --> 45:06.803
You alright in there?

45:06.835 --> 45:08.271
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

45:09.239 --> 45:10.273
Is that you, Ronnie?

45:17.112 --> 45:18.315
What's up, mate?

45:22.385 --> 45:24.254
I can't fucking do it anymore.

45:25.021 --> 45:27.024
It's just a bad day.
I've had a few, remember?

45:27.456 --> 45:28.391
I'm done.

45:29.559 --> 45:30.894
It's fucked.

45:32.061 --> 45:33.363
Nah... It's over.

45:34.597 --> 45:37.101
I know what you mean, mate,
but I promise you it'll change.

45:37.567 --> 45:39.769
- Come on, Rocket Ronnie!
- Rocket Ronnie.

45:42.105 --> 45:44.775
I wanna smash that fucking bell
in that cunt's face.

45:46.342 --> 45:49.012
Just a couple more hours,
I'll go and buy you a pint, eh?

45:50.045 --> 45:51.213
- That's it.
- Yeah...

45:51.246 --> 45:52.348
That's more like it.

46:13.869 --> 46:15.938
What a twat!

46:17.574 --> 46:19.309
First in the measure!

46:20.275 --> 46:22.444
- Oh, my God...
- OK.

46:22.478 --> 46:24.014
I'm gonna go
for a cigarette.

46:24.047 --> 46:25.014
- Can I have a fag?
- Yeah.

46:50.239 --> 46:52.575
You cunt,
fucking telling me training.

46:56.512 --> 46:58.315
He said he'd be
training tonight.

47:04.887 --> 47:06.824
Standing there
having a fucking drink.

47:07.056 --> 47:09.226
Fuckin' true story.

47:29.612 --> 47:30.614
There you are.

47:37.052 --> 47:38.121
You OK?

47:39.155 --> 47:40.090
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:40.956 --> 47:42.125
Yeah, you sure?

47:43.159 --> 47:44.327
You seem distracted.

47:45.128 --> 47:46.330
No, no, I'm fine.

47:46.963 --> 47:48.031
OK.

47:53.168 --> 47:54.003
Late one, was it?

47:55.137 --> 47:56.172
Why?

47:57.572 --> 47:59.408
I thought we were
training last night?

48:00.009 --> 48:02.112
Were we?
I fancied going to the pub.

48:02.311 --> 48:03.512
Sorry, I forgot all about it.

48:07.449 --> 48:08.083
You forgot.

48:10.452 --> 48:11.889
Well, we can make it up now, no?

48:14.657 --> 48:15.959
Yeah, I suppose we can.

48:19.362 --> 48:20.898
I don't like being letting down.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.167
It was only one session.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.003
It's a trust thing.

48:28.036 --> 48:30.473
I really trusted you and then
you go and do that to me.

48:31.074 --> 48:32.909
It's just a gym, I'm here now.

48:35.344 --> 48:36.646
I've had people
break my heart...

48:37.981 --> 48:39.082
all my life.

48:41.217 --> 48:42.352
Are you joking?

48:43.286 --> 48:45.422
My old man used to lie
to me all the time.

48:47.657 --> 48:49.126
All I ever wanted was...

48:51.360 --> 48:53.297
was some affection
and a cuddle, you know?

48:57.199 --> 48:59.502
But the closest thing I ever got
to love from him was...

49:02.338 --> 49:04.007
was tattooed on his right fist.

49:07.342 --> 49:08.678
I'm not your father, mate.

49:09.478 --> 49:11.047
I'm sorry,
it's not the same thing.

49:12.481 --> 49:14.050
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

49:16.418 --> 49:18.454
It's not your fault,
it's just, um...

49:19.521 --> 49:21.023
It's me,
I've just got some issues

49:21.056 --> 49:22.157
I'm dealing with, that's all.

49:22.190 --> 49:24.159
We all have issues.

49:24.193 --> 49:25.628
It's what makes us human,
you know.

49:25.661 --> 49:27.030
Not like this.

49:28.164 --> 49:29.432
See, I get close to people.

49:31.634 --> 49:33.637
Really close to people,
and then they let me down.

49:36.172 --> 49:38.275
And I can't forgive them.
I want to but I...

49:39.108 --> 49:40.277
I can't.

49:42.311 --> 49:44.481
I am genuinely sorry.

49:44.514 --> 49:46.682
I promise,
I'll let you know next time.

49:48.684 --> 49:50.320
Let's have a good session, eh?

49:51.186 --> 49:53.123
Come on,
I really feel like it today.

49:58.260 --> 49:59.161
Yeah.

50:00.096 --> 50:00.764
There you go.

50:07.135 --> 50:09.072
Fucking hell, what you doing?

50:10.172 --> 50:11.640
I've been thinking about this.

50:12.742 --> 50:14.644
I think it's time
that you stepped up a gear.

50:15.210 --> 50:16.445
No, that stuff's not for me,
mate.

50:17.679 --> 50:18.781
I'm not asking ya.

50:20.849 --> 50:23.487
I'm telling ya,
because you see this?

50:25.221 --> 50:27.090
That's Test Prop,
that's man juice.

50:28.557 --> 50:30.193
- I don't want it.
- Tough fucking shit.

50:30.226 --> 50:31.193
You're getting it.

50:33.161 --> 50:34.797
I'm not OK with needles.

50:34.831 --> 50:36.199
Don't be a fucking wimp.

50:37.567 --> 50:39.402
You won't even feel it,
you won't even notice it.

50:39.702 --> 50:41.038
It's like a little prick.

50:44.273 --> 50:45.608
Fuck it. Go on then.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.282
Keep still.

50:52.315 --> 50:53.583
Fucking hell, that really hurt.

50:55.550 --> 50:57.219
That'd cost you
a fucking bullseye anywhere else

50:57.253 --> 50:58.421
you got it for nish.

50:58.454 --> 51:00.123
Great. I didn't even want it.

51:01.690 --> 51:03.426
Come on, good, that's it...

51:04.793 --> 51:06.128
Good.

51:06.628 --> 51:10.400
Three, good, four, five...

51:11.534 --> 51:13.236
Six, come on, good...

51:14.302 --> 51:15.505
Seven...

51:16.239 --> 51:17.507
eight...

51:18.340 --> 51:20.143
nine... Come on, one more,
my love.

51:20.175 --> 51:22.813
One more, my love.
One more, my love. Good boy.

51:25.514 --> 51:27.317
I'm loving it, I'm loving it,
I'm loving it.

51:31.420 --> 51:33.190
Alright... Shrugs.

51:47.369 --> 51:49.172
Monster!

51:53.543 --> 51:55.479
Yeah, come on!

52:00.682 --> 52:03.219
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, one, two, three...

52:03.552 --> 52:06.422
four, five, six, seven

52:06.655 --> 52:09.458
eight, nine, ten, squeeze.

52:11.527 --> 52:12.862
Keep squeezing, keep squeezing

52:12.894 --> 52:14.797
feel the fucking pain,
feel the pain...

52:15.565 --> 52:17.233
Good boy.

52:17.266 --> 52:18.867
Loving it, loving it, loving it.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.170
Fuck!

52:25.641 --> 52:28.644
No, no,
we're regulated by OFSTED

52:28.677 --> 52:30.346
and the National Board
of Photographers.

52:32.347 --> 52:34.183
I just said go to the website

52:34.217 --> 52:35.718
and look at the terms
and conditions.

52:35.751 --> 52:36.887
It's all above board.

52:38.454 --> 52:39.689
Yeah.

52:39.722 --> 52:41.357
I can see why
you wouldn't be bothered.

52:41.389 --> 52:43.225
It's no skin off my nose.

52:45.994 --> 52:48.197
I don't blame you, love,
it's a scam.

52:48.231 --> 52:49.499
Yeah. It's a load of old shit.

52:50.333 --> 52:51.434
You got a problem, Steve?

52:52.300 --> 52:53.335
Eh?

53:05.947 --> 53:07.483
Simon, what you doing?

53:08.650 --> 53:10.586
I'm reading the paper.
What does it look like?

53:10.853 --> 53:12.621
But you haven't got anything
on the board though?

53:12.655 --> 53:13.990
Yeah, I can see that.

53:14.023 --> 53:15.490
Why don't you get
on the phones then?

53:15.523 --> 53:17.359
Why don't you fuck off, then?

53:17.393 --> 53:19.528
- What?
- You heard, you fucking twat.

53:19.561 --> 53:20.931
Just calm down.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.266
Calm down!

53:25.668 --> 53:26.670
Leave it!

53:27.869 --> 53:30.572
Ah, fuck off, Ron!
You can fuck off an' all.

53:30.606 --> 53:32.742
Fucking calm down, eh!
Fucking hell!

53:34.710 --> 53:37.514
Eh? You fucking...

53:48.657 --> 53:50.826
What's that, eh?
Ding-ding, ding-ding.

53:51.960 --> 53:52.861
There you go.

53:55.063 --> 53:56.465
Fucking come on...

53:56.498 --> 53:58.567
- Yeah, yeah, Ron.
- Oh, fuck. Just come on.

54:01.403 --> 54:02.371
Yeah?

54:03.972 --> 54:05.708
Get off him, man!

54:05.740 --> 54:07.376
Fucking hell!

54:07.409 --> 54:10.512
Come on! Get out,
get out, get out!

54:15.451 --> 54:16.820
You can't blame the Test.

54:18.353 --> 54:20.322
You've been wanting
to do that for ages.

54:20.588 --> 54:23.058
The gear just gave you
the courage, that's all.

54:23.092 --> 54:25.662
But I've never really lost
my temper before. Not like that.

54:25.695 --> 54:28.565
I mean, I couldn't see straight,
I lost it.

54:29.097 --> 54:31.433
That's because you're
becoming a real man.

54:32.335 --> 54:34.304
Yeah, a real skint one.

54:35.771 --> 54:38.041
You know what? Fuck 'em.
You'll get another job.

54:38.907 --> 54:41.310
I was there a year,
now I can't get a reference.

54:48.918 --> 54:49.885
I've got it.

54:51.454 --> 54:53.523
Why don't you come
and work for me for a while?

54:54.956 --> 54:56.458
Don't need charity, Terry.

54:56.492 --> 54:58.561
It's not charity, is it?
How's it charity, Simon?

54:59.728 --> 55:01.496
I need help,
there's things needs doing

55:01.530 --> 55:02.865
there's deliveries and shit.

55:02.898 --> 55:04.701
The only question is
can you drive?

55:04.967 --> 55:05.902
Yeah, sure.

55:06.735 --> 55:08.605
Well, there you go,
I need the help.

55:08.903 --> 55:10.039
You'll be perfect for it.

55:10.806 --> 55:11.641
Maybe.

55:12.375 --> 55:13.775
Ah, just reminded me

55:13.809 --> 55:15.644
there's another little favour
I need to ask ya

55:15.677 --> 55:17.079
and this could be
perfect timing.

55:17.646 --> 55:18.715
Yeah?

55:19.414 --> 55:20.817
You're never gonna
believe this.

55:21.449 --> 55:22.451
I've got a good friend

55:22.485 --> 55:24.721
whose looking for a place
to live for a few months

55:24.753 --> 55:27.089
and I said that she could come
and live with us for a bit.

55:27.123 --> 55:28.791
I'm not sure, Terry. Who is she?

55:29.391 --> 55:30.592
A really good friend.

55:31.726 --> 55:33.929
Would I lie to ya? I'm talking
a really good friend.

55:35.030 --> 55:36.865
She's going through it
at the moment.

55:37.099 --> 55:39.869
Between me and you, the courts
have taken her daughter away.

55:40.536 --> 55:42.739
She's distraught, she's upset.

55:43.706 --> 55:45.875
She needs my support,
she needs our support.

55:46.074 --> 55:47.643
Well, can I think about it?

55:47.675 --> 55:50.512
Well, I've gone and told her
now, she's all excited.

55:51.547 --> 55:53.115
What is the problem with you?

55:53.949 --> 55:56.152
There's no problem, just you've
not been here five minutes

55:56.184 --> 55:58.688
and now you're inviting
strangers to come live with us.

56:00.088 --> 56:02.458
Why'd they take her daughter
in the first place?

56:04.025 --> 56:06.395
She's got loads of dirty,
tasty, filthy mates.

56:06.695 --> 56:07.963
I need time.

56:07.996 --> 56:10.466
You don't! What you need
is more rent coming in.

56:13.101 --> 56:14.403
See, I think...

56:14.869 --> 56:16.405
you should give it a go.

56:16.438 --> 56:19.141
She's a lovely,
sincere, homely girl.

56:21.210 --> 56:22.612
Simon, meet Crystal.

56:22.878 --> 56:24.447
Hi!

56:25.047 --> 56:26.750
- Hi.
- Hello.

56:27.682 --> 56:29.152
Thanks for this.

56:29.184 --> 56:31.054
I am gonna look after
both of ya.

56:31.519 --> 56:32.521
No problem.

56:34.657 --> 56:36.425
Terry tell me
that your missus left ya.

56:39.728 --> 56:41.197
- Yeah.
- Don't you worry, darling

56:41.230 --> 56:43.932
cos I'm gonna introduce you
to all of my friends.

56:44.599 --> 56:45.902
You're cute, you know.

56:45.934 --> 56:47.536
She's just being friendly,
it's alright.

56:47.570 --> 56:48.871
I'm always friendly.

56:50.639 --> 56:52.041
- Just gonna nip upstairs.
- Yeah.

56:52.074 --> 56:53.409
Aw...

56:55.043 --> 56:56.413
Poor love.

56:56.878 --> 56:57.947
He needs cheering up.

56:59.748 --> 57:01.050
Why don't we have a party?

57:01.083 --> 57:02.518
- A party.
- Yes!

57:02.550 --> 57:04.219
A fucking party, liven him up
a little bit!

57:04.253 --> 57:05.188
- Yes!
- You look unbelievable!

57:38.820 --> 57:40.456
You ever been to prison,
Terry?

57:42.190 --> 57:43.192
Who you been talking to?

57:43.925 --> 57:45.461
No one.

57:45.661 --> 57:47.096
I thought
you mentioned it before.

57:48.030 --> 57:48.965
Yeah.

57:50.965 --> 57:52.067
How long did you do?

57:52.101 --> 57:53.568
Five years in the Ville.

57:53.601 --> 57:56.572
Five years, really? How was it?

57:57.572 --> 57:58.907
Absolutely loved it, good times.

58:00.543 --> 58:01.711
You serious?

58:01.744 --> 58:02.879
What's not to love?

58:04.280 --> 58:06.483
Good gyms, good friends,
proper routine.

58:07.248 --> 58:08.917
If you ain't afraid
to go to the shovel

58:08.951 --> 58:10.853
you can be the hardest man
in the world.

58:17.159 --> 58:18.260
What d'you do?

58:19.929 --> 58:21.798
Rape. You using that talc?

58:22.565 --> 58:23.833
You are joking?

58:25.333 --> 58:26.568
Look.

58:26.969 --> 58:28.104
That's it for today.

58:28.771 --> 58:29.806
Was that a joke?

58:30.039 --> 58:31.774
Too many questions, Si.

58:59.768 --> 59:01.036
Alright, Big Dave.

59:01.070 --> 59:02.572
Looking good, man.

59:03.672 --> 59:04.740
Robbie.

59:04.940 --> 59:06.642
- Seem to be in a hurry?
- Steve about?

59:06.675 --> 59:07.877
Yeah, he's just over there.

59:07.909 --> 59:09.011
Great.

59:10.878 --> 59:12.548
Alright, Steve, here you go.

59:12.748 --> 59:14.250
Those are the boxes, are they?

59:14.282 --> 59:15.317
- Yeah.
- Right, aye.

59:16.784 --> 59:18.153
You're fucking late, like,
aren't ya?

59:18.186 --> 59:19.621
Where you been?

59:19.655 --> 59:21.224
Took a wrong turn,
sorry about that.

59:21.789 --> 59:23.692
- That's all good, right?
- I'll check it. Right.

59:23.726 --> 59:24.927
- Cheers, man.
- See ya later.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.028
See you next week.
OK, Rob.

59:27.061 --> 59:27.963
See ya, man.

59:30.932 --> 59:32.034
Good.

59:33.036 --> 59:35.204
Good, squeeze at the top,
squeeze at the top.

59:35.237 --> 59:36.172
You know the drill.

59:39.907 --> 59:41.376
I'm having a party
tomorrow night.

59:41.409 --> 59:42.911
What?

59:42.945 --> 59:44.780
Well, we're having a party.

59:45.047 --> 59:46.148
Again?

59:46.949 --> 59:48.351
I don't really feel like it.

59:48.384 --> 59:49.918
Why, what's the issue?

59:50.284 --> 59:52.221
Well, no issue, it's just...

59:55.356 --> 59:57.092
I still miss her, you know.

59:57.126 --> 59:58.728
Oh, please!

59:59.128 --> 01:00:01.097
You're not still
crying about that one?

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.867
Look, birds are fine
until they find you out.

01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:07.402
And then it's time to get a
new one. You've got to move on.

01:00:07.436 --> 01:00:08.838
Find me out?

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:10.239
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

01:00:11.673 --> 01:00:13.909
You need cheering up
and we need a proper blowout.

01:00:13.942 --> 01:00:16.344
- I'm not sure that's the answer.
- It's always the answer.

01:00:16.378 --> 01:00:18.181
And it gets you
training harder.

01:00:18.746 --> 01:00:21.250
- How'd you work that out?
- Dopamine and serotonin.

01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:22.784
Yeah, it depletes them.

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:24.920
Yeah, then the training
puts it back, don't it?

01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:27.822
You gotta keep pushing
that body harder and harder.

01:00:27.856 --> 01:00:29.925
Yeah, not with booze
and drugs though.

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:31.961
How can that be good?
You told me to give up!

01:00:36.465 --> 01:00:37.634
You know what you are?

01:00:38.967 --> 01:00:40.369
You're a fucking little bore.

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.184
Go on, girl, go on.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.320
Go for it!

01:06:33.188 --> 01:06:34.623
Go on, get out of here...

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.994
Go for it, get in.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.163
That's it. Harder, harder.

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:44.767
Make them bounce,
make them bounce.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.068
Keep it up...

01:08:12.554 --> 01:08:14.590
Ah, here he is!

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.227
You alright, love?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.462
Yeah, fine.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.372
Great party, mate,
weren't it, eh?

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.309
Yeah, it was, yeah.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.810
Till a certain point,
then I blacked out.

01:08:35.844 --> 01:08:37.145
Don't remember a thing.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:39.881
- Very convenient for ya.
- Yeah...

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:42.250
Amnesia.

01:08:42.684 --> 01:08:43.786
Oh...

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:47.555
Is that what they call it?

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.359
What do you mean?

01:08:54.895 --> 01:08:56.465
Really short memory of yours.

01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:01.203
I don't remember what happened.

01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:02.537
I'm really sorry
if I was out of order.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:03.837
You protest too much.

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:05.307
Leave him alone.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.408
I'm sorry again.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.410
I was fucked, I...

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:12.180
just remember waking up
and you were both in my bed

01:09:12.212 --> 01:09:15.184
and then I might've had
flashbacks but nothing more.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.629
Please tell me what I did.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.233
Listen, it was nothing
to worry about, love.

01:09:33.768 --> 01:09:36.305
As usual,
things got a little, uh...

01:09:37.337 --> 01:09:38.439
out of hand.

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:41.911
I mean, you and Terry did
take things a little bit far!

01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:49.716
Aw, look, you've upset him now!

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:52.421
Leave him, he'll be alright.

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.390
Nah, go after him.

01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:55.823
No, I'm watching this.

01:09:57.725 --> 01:09:59.627
Oh yeah, apparently
I've got a kid now?

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.297
Oh... Sorry, I forgot
to tell you about that one.

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:04.600
Yeah, you bloody did.

01:11:06.728 --> 01:11:08.463
Let's go and get him
out of his room.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.666
Come on, love.

01:11:11.498 --> 01:11:13.368
- Leave him.
- What?

01:11:14.769 --> 01:11:16.704
Go and get
your little training partner.

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:18.740
I said no.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:24.378
You know what,
they're so cute together.

01:11:24.412 --> 01:11:25.981
They go to the gym together

01:11:26.014 --> 01:11:28.382
and they wear matching
little outfits.

01:11:30.752 --> 01:11:32.921
Oh, come on, let's go
and get him out his pit.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:34.955
He ain't been
out of there in days.

01:11:34.988 --> 01:11:36.924
Yeah, and you know why,
don't ya?

01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:39.894
Because he's been funny
with me since the party.

01:11:39.927 --> 01:11:42.331
- Oh, stop being so sensitive!
- I'm not being sensitive.

01:11:42.363 --> 01:11:43.597
He thinks he's above me.

01:11:43.631 --> 01:11:44.966
He thinks he's above
everybody in this room.

01:11:44.998 --> 01:11:46.335
Don't you get it?

01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:49.570
I'm done with it.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.722
I'm just cruising
at the minute, so I'm taking

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.725
two shots of Test
and Amphe a week.

01:12:09.757 --> 01:12:12.427
So that's like 600 milligrams
a week.

01:12:12.627 --> 01:12:14.029
That's just me cruising,
you see.

01:12:14.061 --> 01:12:16.430
How's it make
you feel? Fucking like a man?

01:12:16.463 --> 01:12:18.399
Makes us feel like
a 20-year-old again.

01:12:18.432 --> 01:12:19.568
Yeah, I love it!

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.434
It's fucking great, mate.

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.604
So my little order
I put in last week

01:12:22.636 --> 01:12:24.005
you're on top it, yeah?
It's coming Thursday?

01:12:24.037 --> 01:12:25.373
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good man.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.608
Definitely, yeah, yep.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.842
- Don't let me down.
- No, I won't.

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:28.811
I promise you, man.

01:13:30.872 --> 01:13:32.841
<i>You had a home, you had a kid.</i>

01:13:32.873 --> 01:13:33.841
<i>What happened?</i>

01:13:34.742 --> 01:13:36.677
<i>I picked up a drink one day</i>

01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:39.014
<i>and within two months,
I was sleeping under a...</i>

01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:40.548
<i>under a bridge.</i>

01:13:41.248 --> 01:13:42.784
<i>How bad is the drinking?</i>

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:44.586
<i>It's pretty bad.</i>

01:13:45.886 --> 01:13:48.722
<i>Blackouts, sickness every
morning, diarrhoea. It's, uh...</i>

01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:50.125
<i>How much do you drink?</i>

01:13:50.158 --> 01:13:52.995
<i>On average, eight to ten...</i>

01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:56.798
<i>What's the worst thing
you've done under the influence?</i>

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:58.199
<i>What are you most ashamed of?</i>

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:04.706
Alright?

01:14:05.773 --> 01:14:07.775
Yeah, just a bit tired.

01:14:09.243 --> 01:14:10.912
- Gonna grab an early night.
- Oh...

01:14:11.779 --> 01:14:13.215
See you in the morning then,
yeah?

01:14:14.114 --> 01:14:14.983
Night, night.

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.019
You better go and talk
to that little prick.

01:14:19.052 --> 01:14:20.555
- Why?
- Go and cheer him up.

01:14:20.587 --> 01:14:21.922
No, no,
I've done enough for him.

01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:23.592
I've got him a job,
I've got him fit

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.126
I'll tell you what he is.

01:14:25.158 --> 01:14:28.063
I'll tell you exactly what he
is, he's a spoilt little brat.

01:14:28.662 --> 01:14:31.567
- But you have to, don't ya?
- Fuck him.

01:14:31.932 --> 01:14:34.603
Go and give him a pep talk!
We've come this far, ain't we?

01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:37.206
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you do.

01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:40.675
Calm down, alright?

01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:45.247
Yeah?

01:14:57.158 --> 01:14:58.260
What's up?

01:14:58.792 --> 01:14:59.994
Nothing.

01:15:00.194 --> 01:15:02.831
When you say nothing,
I know there's something.

01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:04.665
Honestly, I don't want
to talk about it now.

01:15:08.269 --> 01:15:10.105
Not seen you
at the gym for a while.

01:15:11.104 --> 01:15:12.507
No, not felt like it.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.775
How about first thing
tomorrow morning

01:15:14.809 --> 01:15:16.244
me and you,
the old A-Team back?

01:15:17.612 --> 01:15:18.579
I'll see how I feel.

01:15:31.792 --> 01:15:32.927
I've gotta say this.

01:15:35.195 --> 01:15:37.565
But you have been so weird
since the party.

01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:42.203
Yeah, I'm a bit shaken by it,
to be honest.

01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:43.939
Please, come on,
it can't be that bad.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.543
You know what hurts me
is the fact that...

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.045
I've really gone
out of my way...

01:15:51.078 --> 01:15:52.113
and I finally...

01:15:53.347 --> 01:15:55.884
finally felt that me and you
were getting to know each other.

01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:58.320
And we was.

01:16:00.087 --> 01:16:01.023
It's just...

01:16:01.989 --> 01:16:03.925
I'm not sure what I'm doing
at the moment.

01:16:03.957 --> 01:16:05.760
I'm not sure what's going on
in my life.

01:16:08.061 --> 01:16:09.297
But I've helped you, ain't I?

01:16:10.797 --> 01:16:11.798
I mean, I have gone
out of my way

01:16:11.832 --> 01:16:14.168
like I've never gone
out of my way for anybody.

01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:17.773
I know you have
and I'm really grateful

01:16:17.971 --> 01:16:19.773
it's just that...
What the fuck?

01:16:19.806 --> 01:16:21.777
Calm down, just calm down,
please, calm down.

01:16:21.975 --> 01:16:23.077
Calm down, Simon.

01:16:24.278 --> 01:16:25.880
I'm not gay, Terry.

01:16:25.912 --> 01:16:26.947
And I'm not a poof.

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:29.384
I swear to you I'm not a poof,
I'm no pillow-biter.

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:30.852
What was that then?

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:32.787
It was just affection,
it was just affection!

01:16:32.819 --> 01:16:34.755
I swear to ya.
If you don't like it, it's fine.

01:16:34.788 --> 01:16:36.390
I'll never do it again,
I promise ya.

01:16:36.423 --> 01:16:39.159
No, I'm not into that. I don't
know why you thought I would be.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:40.729
You didn't mind at the party,
did ya?

01:16:40.761 --> 01:16:43.030
I don't remember the party,
Terry. Fucking hell, man.

01:16:43.064 --> 01:16:44.365
You say you don't remember

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.068
but every time
I look in them eyes...

01:16:46.266 --> 01:16:47.603
I know you do.

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:49.704
I really don't.

01:16:52.939 --> 01:16:55.143
You've made me feel ashamed,
Simon, do you know that?

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:58.980
You've made me feel ashamed
coming up here

01:17:00.681 --> 01:17:02.216
because I wanted to do
the right thing

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.653
because I care about you,
and I didn't want...

01:17:04.685 --> 01:17:06.688
The thought of you
being up here on your own.

01:17:07.954 --> 01:17:09.224
I just wanted to cheer you up,
that's all

01:17:09.256 --> 01:17:10.658
because you're my mate.

01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:14.296
But now I know it was a mistake,
and I'm sorry.

01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:17.198
Look, I'm sorry, right?

01:17:17.798 --> 01:17:20.167
I'm sorry if...
I gave you the wrong idea

01:17:20.768 --> 01:17:22.738
if I misled you in any way.

01:17:23.837 --> 01:17:24.939
But I'm not like that.

01:17:29.743 --> 01:17:31.313
I've got some more work,
if you want it.

01:17:36.016 --> 01:17:37.284
What sort of work, driving?

01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:38.286
No, no, no.

01:17:39.787 --> 01:17:40.922
Much more than driving.

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:45.694
Because I thought about it
and I made a decision

01:17:45.726 --> 01:17:47.295
to step you up
because you deserve it.

01:17:48.195 --> 01:17:49.363
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:55.403
Night then.

01:17:58.105 --> 01:17:59.239
I said "goodnight", Simon.

01:17:59.273 --> 01:18:00.676
Yeah, night.

01:18:15.422 --> 01:18:16.257
Well?

01:18:17.891 --> 01:18:19.161
He's a baby, is what he is.

01:18:19.393 --> 01:18:20.462
Is he any better?

01:18:21.095 --> 01:18:22.164
Yeah.

01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:24.231
I got him feeling
a lot better.

01:18:24.265 --> 01:18:25.734
Ah, there you go.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.302
You got your
little boyfriend back.

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:30.372
Told you so, didn't I?

01:18:32.372 --> 01:18:33.442
You've done really well.

01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:36.911
So proud of you,
do you know that?

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:41.283
Thanks, love.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:44.351
- That means the world to me.
- Hm...

01:18:51.091 --> 01:18:52.226
Shall we?

01:18:54.929 --> 01:18:56.797
- What, here?
- Yeah, why not?

01:18:57.931 --> 01:18:59.434
I wanna stick it in you
hard right now.

01:19:01.569 --> 01:19:03.772
Ah, I gotta watch this first.

01:19:04.471 --> 01:19:05.840
Can't you tape it?

01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:10.411
Please? Just...

01:19:10.444 --> 01:19:12.180
I said I wanna
watch this first.

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.154
That's the thing
about preacher curls

01:19:19.186 --> 01:19:20.320
no matter what you do

01:19:20.354 --> 01:19:21.923
you cannot cheat
on them fuckers.

01:19:21.956 --> 01:19:23.158
Tell me about it!

01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:24.826
My arms feel like
balloons now!

01:19:25.225 --> 01:19:26.960
Right, what you doing now?

01:19:26.993 --> 01:19:28.829
Go home and have a shake,
I think, yeah?

01:19:28.863 --> 01:19:30.465
I'm going to the pub, mate,
you coming?

01:19:30.497 --> 01:19:32.466
Nah, don't fancy boozing
this evening.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.335
You are definitely, definitely
becoming

01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:35.870
a little bit of a wimp, mate.

01:19:35.903 --> 01:19:37.405
I thought you had more going on
and more to ya.

01:19:37.438 --> 01:19:38.573
I just had a good session

01:19:38.605 --> 01:19:40.073
I don't fancy drinking
straight away.

01:19:40.106 --> 01:19:41.943
Ooh, whatever!

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:49.944
<i>Get in there!</i>

01:20:51.078 --> 01:20:52.280
<i>Come on...</i>

01:20:52.579 --> 01:20:54.082
<i>Let's get nasty!</i>

01:20:54.114 --> 01:20:55.282
<i>Let's get nasty!</i>

01:20:57.284 --> 01:20:58.452
<i>Go on!</i>

01:20:58.485 --> 01:21:00.320
<i>Let's get going now! Come on.</i>

01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:01.590
<i>Tighter!</i>

01:21:04.024 --> 01:21:05.326
<i>That's better!</i>

01:21:07.094 --> 01:21:08.430
<i>Yes, go on!</i>

01:21:10.363 --> 01:21:12.132
<i>Let's go again!</i>

01:21:12.632 --> 01:21:15.202
<i>Brilliant! Brilliant!</i>

01:21:19.273 --> 01:21:22.443
So where is one's
fine lady Crystal tonight, Tel?

01:21:22.475 --> 01:21:24.179
Where do you fucking think?

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:27.114
She's somewhere
with some fucking geezer

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.650
with her arse in the air

01:21:28.682 --> 01:21:31.152
getting fucking
smashed up the bottle.

01:21:31.185 --> 01:21:32.019
You know why?

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.122
No, no, no, let me just
tell you this.

01:21:35.155 --> 01:21:36.224
This is a fucking secret.

01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:38.659
I love her. Yeah?

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.628
But she loves cock more.

01:21:41.662 --> 01:21:43.264
Other geezers' cocks.

01:21:43.296 --> 01:21:45.165
A bit like Simon, eh?

01:21:45.198 --> 01:21:46.166
Fucking joke.

01:21:46.199 --> 01:21:48.036
All the time, I tell her
I love her all the time.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.304
She don't fucking take
a blind bit of notice.

01:21:49.337 --> 01:21:50.605
Because of that cunt!

01:21:51.738 --> 01:21:52.907
Simon!

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:58.078
Simple fucking Simon!

01:22:00.213 --> 01:22:01.215
Get him down, Tel.

01:22:01.247 --> 01:22:03.083
Simple Simon!

01:22:03.283 --> 01:22:05.353
- Get him down!
- Simple Simon!

01:22:07.121 --> 01:22:08.256
Simple Si...

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:12.460
Put the shits right up him, aye?

01:22:13.327 --> 01:22:15.063
Fuck, that's him,
he's fell out of bed.

01:22:15.695 --> 01:22:17.998
- Simon!
- Simon!

01:22:18.032 --> 01:22:20.735
Hope you ain't playing
with your fucking private parts!

01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:23.605
Tel, does he know,
has he got any idea?

01:22:24.104 --> 01:22:25.539
No, he ain't got a fucking clue.

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.042
- Really?
- Nothing!

01:22:27.274 --> 01:22:29.311
Well... How long do you think
we've got then?

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:32.079
Not long.
Couple of weeks?

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.448
Couple of weeks max, yeah.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.314
And then what?

01:22:34.347 --> 01:22:36.384
Kami-fucking-kaze, Tel!

01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:39.987
Operation Kamikaze!

01:22:41.154 --> 01:22:42.389
But let me just say this.

01:22:43.423 --> 01:22:44.693
I'm moving it forward.

01:22:45.259 --> 01:22:46.994
Patience, man.
- No, fuck patience!

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.997
I'm moving it forward,
he's just a mug.

01:22:49.363 --> 01:22:51.466
As soon as that cunt
arrives in France

01:22:51.498 --> 01:22:53.467
- it's all over for him.
- Still got him delivering?

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.235
Every fucking day.

01:22:55.269 --> 01:22:56.570
Driving around in that van

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.439
thinks he's selling
fucking choc ices.

01:22:58.471 --> 01:23:00.707
- Mr Whippy!
- Giving it like... his face.

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.409
He ain't got a clue!

01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:04.445
He ain't got a clue
what he's got in the van!

01:23:04.478 --> 01:23:05.980
Well, get him down, eh?

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.615
Honestly, get them knives, man.

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:10.418
Show him what the fuck
is going on, man.

01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:11.786
Go on then. Go up there.

01:23:11.819 --> 01:23:13.154
Open that door

01:23:13.186 --> 01:23:14.756
- and give him a fucking...
- Go on, Simon!

01:23:14.788 --> 01:23:16.157
I'm coming!

01:23:17.224 --> 01:23:18.226
Whoa, watch that.

01:23:22.462 --> 01:23:25.399
Simon!

01:23:28.668 --> 01:23:30.471
- Simon!
- Fuck him.

01:23:31.404 --> 01:23:34.574
Si, there's a lovely big fat
line down here for you, son!

01:23:34.608 --> 01:23:37.712
- Simon, Simon, Simon!
- Get the fuck on!

01:23:38.679 --> 01:23:41.681
His face the other night.
Simon, Simon...

01:23:41.715 --> 01:23:44.552
Simon! Simon! Simon!

01:23:55.328 --> 01:23:58.498
Simon! Simon! Simon!

01:23:58.532 --> 01:24:01.069
Simon...

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:17.652
- Hello.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

01:24:18.685 --> 01:24:20.421
- <i>You alright, son?</i>
- Yeah.

01:24:21.822 --> 01:24:23.690
<i>Didn't keep you awake
last night, did we?</i>

01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:27.161
Awake? No, why?

01:24:28.162 --> 01:24:30.164
<i>Nah, it's just that I had
a few of the boys back late</i>

01:24:30.197 --> 01:24:31.298
<i>and it got a bit naughty.</i>

01:24:32.666 --> 01:24:34.202
No, didn't hear anything.

01:24:35.168 --> 01:24:36.371
<i>Oh, by the way.</i>

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.173
<i>I got some absolutely blinding
news for you.</i>

01:24:40.807 --> 01:24:42.275
- <i>Big job.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

01:24:42.309 --> 01:24:43.277
<i>I mean a proper big job.</i>

01:24:45.145 --> 01:24:47.347
<i>A lot of money,
parcels need taking.</i>

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:49.084
OK.

01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:51.319
<i>To Dover.</i>

01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:53.121
- Sorry?
- <i>I said Dover.</i>

01:24:53.487 --> 01:24:54.588
<i>And proper money.</i>

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.525
OK.

01:24:57.557 --> 01:24:58.760
<i>Can you meet me in an hour?</i>

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:01.762
- Sure.
- <i>You got a pen?</i>

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.882
Oi, oi! Here he is.

01:25:35.863 --> 01:25:37.532
Fucking took your time,
didn't ya?

01:25:38.332 --> 01:25:40.501
Simon, this is Big Dave,
he's gonna show you where to go.

01:25:40.533 --> 01:25:41.469
- Alright, Dave.
- Simon.

01:25:42.936 --> 01:25:44.238
What, you off?

01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:46.207
I got fish to fry, mate.

01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:47.307
I'll see you
in a couple of days.

01:25:47.341 --> 01:25:48.643
Sorry?

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.811
- When you get back from France.
- France?

01:25:50.844 --> 01:25:52.480
You are going
on a nice little break.

01:25:52.512 --> 01:25:54.649
Listen, there's an envelope
in there with the boxes.

01:25:54.681 --> 01:25:56.850
All the info's in there,
all taken care of.

01:25:56.884 --> 01:25:58.886
Please enjoy yourself.

01:25:58.918 --> 01:26:00.354
What?

01:26:00.386 --> 01:26:02.389
It's a little trip,
cheer you up.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.226
You've been down
in the dumps lately

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.628
and I think this is
the perfect tonic

01:26:07.661 --> 01:26:09.230
just to bring you back up.

01:26:09.262 --> 01:26:10.564
I can't go to France.

01:26:10.597 --> 01:26:12.300
I don't have my passport,
for one.

01:26:12.332 --> 01:26:13.867
You do, it's in there
with the other gear.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.235
What? How?

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.372
Well, Crystal found it
in your bedroom.

01:26:18.005 --> 01:26:19.673
She's a good girl, she is.

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:21.475
You went in my room
and found me passport?

01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:23.743
I didn't! Crystal did
to save fucking time.

01:26:23.777 --> 01:26:26.314
Why would you go in my room? I
don't want you going in my room.

01:26:26.346 --> 01:26:27.514
Come on, it's done now.

01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:28.483
It's all written down
what you gotta do.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.751
I've gone out of my way

01:26:30.783 --> 01:26:32.554
to get you a little bit
of spending money.

01:26:33.753 --> 01:26:35.922
Now, all you need to do
is deliver this lot

01:26:35.956 --> 01:26:38.493
pick something else up and
come back in a couple of days.

01:26:39.792 --> 01:26:41.362
You been to France before,
ain't ya?

01:26:41.395 --> 01:26:42.797
Yeah, I have,
I don't wanna go.

01:26:42.829 --> 01:26:44.497
Where's your sense
of adventure?

01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:46.466
What else are you
gonna be fucking doing?

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.336
That's not the fucking point
though, is it!

01:26:57.344 --> 01:26:59.480
Dave, show him what to do,
put him through the drill.

01:27:00.847 --> 01:27:02.317
You'll have a good time.

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.240
- Is that the lot then?
- That's it.

01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:29.844
Just make sure
this gets there on time.

01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:16.122
Kamikaze.

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:18.525
<i>As soon as
that cunt arrives in France</i>

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:19.661
<i>it's all over for him.</i>

01:28:44.484 --> 01:28:45.686
Kamikaze.

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:48.655
<i>No, fuck patience,
I'm moving it forward.</i>

01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:49.890
<i>He's just a mug!</i>

01:28:49.922 --> 01:28:51.826
<i>Kami-fucking-kaze!</i>

01:29:36.603 --> 01:29:37.572
Terry!

01:29:40.506 --> 01:29:41.408
Tel?

01:29:44.845 --> 01:29:46.079
Tel?

01:29:51.885 --> 01:29:52.854
Tel?

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.643
The photos...

01:30:20.713 --> 01:30:21.983
Oh, fuck!

01:30:24.917 --> 01:30:27.054
You fucking evil bastard.

01:30:32.158 --> 01:30:33.927
Ah, fuck!

01:30:44.938 --> 01:30:45.773
Fuck.

01:30:47.507 --> 01:30:48.576
Fuck.

01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:05.592
Fuck you!

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.829
You cunt!
You cunt! You cunt!

01:31:12.064 --> 01:31:13.033
He's fucking dead.

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:41.595
Alright, Paul?

01:31:41.627 --> 01:31:42.996
Alright, buddy, how you doing,
alright?

01:31:43.029 --> 01:31:43.997
Yeah.

01:31:45.565 --> 01:31:46.766
You seen Ken?

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.836
Yeah, mate,
he's just gone to the shitter.

01:31:48.868 --> 01:31:49.903
Oh, OK.

01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:51.872
Listen, you know Terry?

01:31:51.904 --> 01:31:53.541
Yeah, just missed him.
Just missed him.

01:31:53.573 --> 01:31:54.641
Yeah, I know.

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.109
How long's he worked here?

01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:58.712
Work here, mate?
He doesn't work here.

01:31:58.912 --> 01:32:00.981
But he's a trainer here, right?
He's a personal trainer.

01:32:01.948 --> 01:32:04.284
The only person I've seen
him train, buddy, is you.

01:32:05.252 --> 01:32:06.954
But he told me
he had other clients.

01:32:06.987 --> 01:32:09.155
Clients? No, mate, I think
he's winding you up.

01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:10.725
Just you, buddy, sorry.

01:32:11.591 --> 01:32:12.759
What do you know about him?

01:32:12.792 --> 01:32:14.594
What d'you mean,
"What do I know about him?"

01:32:14.627 --> 01:32:17.063
Who the fuck are you? You could
be fucking PC Plod, mate.

01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:19.198
- I don't know you from Adam.
- Oh, I look like PC Plod?

01:32:19.231 --> 01:32:21.201
Listen, you wanna find out,
ask him yourself, mate.

01:32:21.234 --> 01:32:22.570
Oh, thanks friend.

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:23.637
Anytime, buddy.

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:25.405
You must have an address
or something for him.

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:27.274
Just...
All I need is an address.

01:32:27.306 --> 01:32:28.675
Data protection confidentiality.

01:32:28.708 --> 01:32:30.310
Oh, data protection yeah?
You fucking...

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:31.578
Tell you what...

01:32:33.212 --> 01:32:35.215
Yeah, run. Run like the little
prick that you are!

01:32:56.269 --> 01:32:58.204
Hi, I wonder if you can help?

01:32:58.238 --> 01:33:00.106
I'm trying to locate a relative
of mine.

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:02.209
I know they shop with you,
his name's Terry.

01:33:02.242 --> 01:33:04.078
Do you know what's happened,
his daughter...

01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:05.912
you know,
she's had an allergy...

01:33:05.945 --> 01:33:07.180
She's got a peanut allergy

01:33:07.213 --> 01:33:08.849
and she's been rushed
to hospital.

01:33:09.048 --> 01:33:11.051
Like, her lips have blown up
and everything.

01:33:11.083 --> 01:33:13.253
She's in pretty
critical condition, yeah.

01:33:13.753 --> 01:33:14.921
Yep, go on.

01:33:15.721 --> 01:33:17.925
Excellent. Oh, that is...
Thank you so much.

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.143
Can I ask you a question?

01:33:37.743 --> 01:33:39.279
I believe Terry
used to live here.

01:33:39.979 --> 01:33:41.014
What?

01:33:41.213 --> 01:33:43.082
Terry, big guy,
you remember him?

01:33:43.115 --> 01:33:45.152
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:47.722
I've got this address down
as where Terry used to live.

01:33:47.953 --> 01:33:49.122
It's a diner.

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:51.292
Does anyone live upstairs?

01:33:51.725 --> 01:33:53.027
Are you winding me up?

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.162
No, I have this place down
as a residential address.

01:33:55.194 --> 01:33:56.262
I'm just asking you!

01:34:32.998 --> 01:34:34.467
- Alright?
- Alright?

01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:36.302
No, I'm not fucking alright,
where are ya?

01:34:38.371 --> 01:34:39.707
Around.

01:34:39.739 --> 01:34:40.774
Are you in France?

01:34:42.007 --> 01:34:44.077
- No.
- <i>Where are you then?</i>

01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:45.712
<i>You're supposed to be
in fucking France.</i>

01:34:47.146 --> 01:34:47.981
I changed my mind.

01:34:48.815 --> 01:34:50.283
Well, you better fucking
un-change it

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:51.284
and get fucking over there now.

01:34:52.886 --> 01:34:53.988
I'm not going, Terry.

01:34:55.287 --> 01:34:56.423
What are you playing at?

01:34:57.423 --> 01:34:58.359
Where are you now?

01:34:59.059 --> 01:35:00.161
Can't say.

01:35:01.561 --> 01:35:03.163
<i>What d'you mean you can't say?
Tell me where you are now.</i>

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:06.099
- I'm done, Terry.
- <i>You're done?</i>

01:35:07.399 --> 01:35:09.804
Well, I tell you something now,
you listen to me.

01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:11.872
You need to get over to France

01:35:11.904 --> 01:35:13.172
because you're working
for me now.

01:35:13.206 --> 01:35:14.475
I've got people waiting

01:35:14.507 --> 01:35:16.443
and you're gonna fuck up
this deal!

01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.248
I've seen the photos, Terry.

01:35:22.448 --> 01:35:24.451
You know,
your little trophy photos.

01:35:27.787 --> 01:35:28.888
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

01:35:33.326 --> 01:35:34.295
<i>You hear what I said?</i>

01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:37.131
Where are you now?

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.001
I'm gonna go to the police.

01:35:42.101 --> 01:35:43.269
What you did.

01:35:48.108 --> 01:35:49.376
What you did
was very, very wrong.

01:35:49.975 --> 01:35:52.445
Listen to me, you soppy fat mug.

01:35:53.479 --> 01:35:55.215
Tell me where you are

01:35:55.448 --> 01:35:57.351
or I'm gonna come
looking for you, I swear.

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.489
I'm going to the police.

01:37:23.036 --> 01:37:24.104
Name.

01:37:24.970 --> 01:37:26.072
Simon Barrett.

01:37:29.074 --> 01:37:31.412
Do you know the man
in these photos?

01:37:33.412 --> 01:37:35.147
For the benefit of the tape

01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:37.317
I'm showing Mr Barrett
the photographs.

01:37:37.984 --> 01:37:38.818
Yes.

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.323
What is your relationship
with this man?

01:37:44.256 --> 01:37:45.425
He's my housemate.

01:37:46.926 --> 01:37:47.627
What's his name?

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:50.963
Terry.

01:37:50.997 --> 01:37:52.032
Surname?

01:37:52.364 --> 01:37:53.466
I don't know.

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:56.369
Oh, Mr Barrett, you seriously
trying to tell me

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.972
you don't know
your housemate's surname?

01:38:01.341 --> 01:38:03.077
- He didn't tell me.
- He never told you.

01:38:05.278 --> 01:38:06.579
Well, do you rent from him?

01:38:07.579 --> 01:38:08.882
No, he rents from me.

01:38:09.315 --> 01:38:10.451
So, you have a contract?

01:38:12.018 --> 01:38:14.087
An agreement,
something in writing?

01:38:14.119 --> 01:38:17.957
No, not really, it all happened
so fast, you know.

01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:20.327
I was going through a bit
of a rough time and, um...

01:38:21.661 --> 01:38:23.529
he paid me upfront
and then I forgot.

01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:29.302
I was stressed.

01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:35.209
Yeah.

01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:37.377
I'm sure you were.

01:38:40.512 --> 01:38:41.381
What's that supposed to mean?

01:38:43.483 --> 01:38:46.587
These images that you gave us.

01:38:49.555 --> 01:38:51.291
These are of a very
serious nature.

01:38:53.525 --> 01:38:55.595
I mean, you do understand that,
don't you, sir?

01:38:57.096 --> 01:38:59.198
Well, obviously, sir.

01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:01.268
That's why I'm giving them
to you.

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.639
What's with the attitude,
Mr Barrett?

01:39:06.238 --> 01:39:07.307
There's no attitude.

01:39:08.507 --> 01:39:09.608
I'm bringing them to you

01:39:09.641 --> 01:39:11.644
because I can see
that they're very wrong.

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:17.584
If I was to say the name
Trevor Richards...

01:39:18.618 --> 01:39:19.987
Ring any bells?

01:39:21.087 --> 01:39:22.323
Trevor Richards?

01:39:23.088 --> 01:39:24.358
No. Why?

01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:26.259
We have reason to believe

01:39:26.292 --> 01:39:28.629
the man in these photographs
is Trevor Richards.

01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:32.199
Who is Trevor Richards?

01:39:32.231 --> 01:39:34.434
Trevor Richards is a man living
in your house right now.

01:39:34.466 --> 01:39:36.036
What do you know about him?

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:38.772
Does he know
you were coming here today?

01:39:38.805 --> 01:39:40.074
No.

01:39:40.672 --> 01:39:43.409
Well, not exactly,
I might have, um...

01:39:44.476 --> 01:39:45.645
I might have threatened him.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.315
So he does know?

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:52.019
Yeah, but I don't think
he believed me.

01:39:55.287 --> 01:39:56.389
What now?

01:39:57.423 --> 01:39:59.626
You can start by writing down
your statement.

01:40:04.363 --> 01:40:05.331
Is he capable of arson?

01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:09.136
Why do you ask?

01:40:10.203 --> 01:40:13.040
Because of my house,
I'm worried about my house.

01:40:19.078 --> 01:40:20.514
I don't think
you quite understand.

01:40:22.314 --> 01:40:23.416
You're going nowhere

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:27.253
until you tell us everything
that we need to know.

01:40:28.654 --> 01:40:29.523
Have you got that?

01:40:30.722 --> 01:40:31.725
Yeah.

01:40:46.338 --> 01:40:47.541
I'll be back in a minute.

01:42:14.627 --> 01:42:15.529
Trevor!

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:26.373
Trevor!

01:43:22.862 --> 01:43:24.230
Fuck.

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:27.894
Ee-oh...

01:44:28.761 --> 01:44:30.530
O-ee-oh...

01:44:30.896 --> 01:44:32.399
Ee-oh...

01:44:33.365 --> 01:44:34.635
O-ee-oh.

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.436
Ee-oh.

01:44:37.002 --> 01:44:38.537
O-ee-oh.

01:44:38.871 --> 01:44:41.541
Ee-oh... O-ee-oh.

01:44:41.774 --> 01:44:42.909
Ee-oh.
