I'm so happy to hear this.

11:09.151 --> 11:13.104
Billy, Emma, say hello
to our newest partner.

11:13.138 --> 11:14.321
Welcome aboard, man. Thanks.

11:14.356 --> 11:15.790
Emma's our geologist.

11:15.824 --> 11:17.174
- Hey. Wick.
- Hey.

11:17.473 --> 11:19.657
Well, hopefully, you're the
man who can answer our riddle.

11:20.015 --> 11:23.034
We bought the piece of
land next to your father's,

11:23.068 --> 11:25.920
but it turns out both
parcels are bone-dry.

11:25.971 --> 11:26.921
Are you sure?

11:26.972 --> 11:28.239
I mean, all my dad ever talked about

11:28.273 --> 11:30.473
was how this land was gonna
be the play of his lifetime.

11:30.509 --> 11:32.842
Yeah, well, what does
he know that we don't?

11:35.053 --> 11:36.814
The U.S.G.S. Survey.

11:37.052 --> 11:39.553
Yeah, all roads seems to
lead back to that, don't they?

11:39.631 --> 11:41.035
Did you ever see it?

11:41.086 --> 11:42.954
No. I wish I did.

11:42.971 --> 11:45.708
He never trusted me
enough to let me fully in.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.758
Well, I'm just thrilled you're with us.

11:48.128 --> 11:49.428
And don't worry.

11:49.453 --> 11:51.887
We'll get our answers another way.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.060
I'm gonna tell you something, Lacey,

11:56.085 --> 11:58.420
and you're not gonna want to hear it.

12:00.765 --> 12:02.312

12:02.692 --> 12:03.625
No.

12:03.659 --> 12:04.860
Daddy, you're wrong.

12:04.894 --> 12:07.712
He promised me that he
would never help the feds.

12:07.747 --> 12:09.214
He lied.

12:09.577 --> 12:11.850
He admitted it to me himself.

12:11.901 --> 12:16.865
In fact, he took great
pleasure in telling me.

12:16.890 --> 12:18.207
Why?

12:18.242 --> 12:19.459
Why would he do that?

12:19.510 --> 12:23.830
Well, he's going to tell you
that it's because I'm evil

12:24.459 --> 12:26.920

Yes.

He's gonna try and spin
this in the worst way, Lacey,

12:39.702 --> 12:41.552

12:41.577 --> 12:45.668
my involvement with Jules
started a long time ago.

12:46.514 --> 12:47.672

12:48.436 --> 12:49.572

also angry about this.

12:56.217 --> 12:57.547
What is this?

12:58.014 --> 13:00.834
That's the police report
from the rig heist.

13:01.788 --> 13:03.555
Wick is the one who stole from me

13:03.589 --> 13:05.803
and left me there to die in the rig fire.

13:06.225 --> 13:08.059
But there's no proof.

13:08.077 --> 13:10.062
This is still unsolved.

13:10.096 --> 13:12.814
It's unsolved because Tip found out

13:12.849 --> 13:15.367
that the feds gave Wick immunity.

13:15.418 --> 13:21.990
Now, why would Wick need
immunity if he wasn't guilty?

13:22.220 --> 13:24.938
I just don't believe that
he could do this to you.

13:25.561 --> 13:27.579
Dad, immunity can be granted for anything.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.281
Maybe the feds think that he was involved

13:29.283 --> 13:31.683
with the stolen U.S.G.S. Survey.

13:32.053 --> 13:34.989
Maybe it has nothing to
do with the rig robbery.

13:37.413 --> 13:38.819
Maybe.

13:38.931 --> 13:43.001
God, you two are always looking
for the worst in each other,

13:43.162 --> 13:44.530

to do with that night,
