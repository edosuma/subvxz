00:01.569 --> 00:02.703
* Shut up!

00:02.736 --> 00:04.305
CHRIS ROCK:
The week before finals

00:04.338 --> 00:06.574
was the most pressure-packed
time of the year.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.343
Kids reacted to the pressure
in lots of different ways.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.813
Some kids took it out
on themselves.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.316
Some kids
took it out on others.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.717
When I got stressed out,

00:16.750 --> 00:18.686
only one thing
ever worked for me:

00:18.719 --> 00:19.687
cracking jokes.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.123
I saw your mama standing
outside the free clinic

00:22.156 --> 00:23.391
reading a bottle of aspirin.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.159
I asked her what she was doing.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.561
She says, "Studying
for my drug test."

00:27.595 --> 00:29.097
:
That's good.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.632
Very good, very
good, very good.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.700
Very funny.

00:32.733 --> 00:33.834
You got a way with words.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.703
Which would be
a good thing

00:35.736 --> 00:37.105
if this was...

00:37.138 --> 00:40.108
you-got-a-way-with-word-ology!

00:40.141 --> 00:41.609
But is this that?

00:41.642 --> 00:42.776
No.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.044
You're right.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.682
Do you know
William Henry Harrison?

00:48.716 --> 00:49.717
Yeah, wasn't he that guy

00:49.750 --> 00:51.552
who cleaned up that woman
in My Fair Lady?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.487
No, that was Rex Harrison.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.455
Oh.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.257
William Henry Harrison

00:56.290 --> 00:59.727
was the ninth President
of the United States,

00:59.760 --> 01:01.629
and he gave

01:01.662 --> 01:05.766
the longest inaugural address
in history.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.201
And guess what?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.269
What?

01:08.302 --> 01:10.604
Since you like
to talk so much,

01:10.638 --> 01:13.641
you are gonna memorize

01:13.674 --> 01:15.143
that speech!

01:15.176 --> 01:16.477
But I have to study for finals.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.512
Not if you don't get
that speech memorized--

01:18.546 --> 01:22.383
because if you don't,
you're gonna get suspended!

01:22.416 --> 01:24.118
And then you
won't be here

01:24.152 --> 01:26.320
to take final exams!

01:26.887 --> 01:29.123
You got a mama joke for that?

01:29.157 --> 01:32.626
If I tell it,
I'll get suspended right now.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.475
* Ah, make it funky now.

Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

02:05.893 --> 02:07.395
In 1987, there was no Internet.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.896
If you wanted information,

02:08.929 --> 02:11.799
you actually had to walk
out of your house and get it.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
William Henry Harrison's
inaugural speech.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.603
There you go.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.771
Thanks. Uh, which page is it on?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.607
All of 'em.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.908
I can't memorize all this.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.877
Memorize? Harrison
couldn't memorize
that, and he wrote it.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.546
Well, I guess I'm gonna need
to take it home.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.948
Can't. It's a reference book.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.783
Can I make a copy?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.485
Sure.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.557
Don't we have a copy machine?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.492
We did, but it
turned out to be a fake.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.860
It was a copy of a copy machine.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.695
The Xerox police
confiscated it.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.632
If your hand starts to cramp up,
use the other one.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.567
I was quite familiar
with that principle.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.569
Your battery's dead.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.870
Dead?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.038
Tattoo, that
doesn't make sense.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.807
I gave my wife money to buy
a new one two months ago.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.510
I don't know, man, I never seen
anything like this before.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.413
It look like this battery been
in here three or four years.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.449
:
How much to replace it?

03:02.483 --> 03:03.784
Sixty dollars.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.819
But that don't include
the spare tires,

03:05.853 --> 03:07.521
the shocks or the brake pads.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.323
What

03:09.357 --> 03:10.358
I don't know.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.492
Just now.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.626
It's your car.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.299
:
My name is Tallulah LaFitte.

03:18.332 --> 03:22.236
I came in here the other day to
get my hair dyed honey brown,

03:22.270 --> 03:23.704
and it come out like this.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.407
Well, did you have color
in your hair before you came in?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.708
So, what if I did?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.843
I didn't want my hair
to be orange.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.645
I look like Ronald Blackdonald.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.282
Well... hair is
like crayons, you know?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.883
You mix colors,
you get new colors.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.885
If you don't know
what you're mixing,

03:37.918 --> 03:39.953
then you don't know
what you're gonna get.

03:39.987 --> 03:43.424
I don't care about
no mixing colors, miss.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.726
You need to give me
a refund.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.429
You need to put
those fingers away.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.498
Um, we don't give refunds.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.932
That's our policy.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.667
Didn't you read the sign?

03:53.701 --> 03:55.269
Then I need to speak
to the manager.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.539
She's just gonna tell you
the same thing I just said.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.040
How do you know that?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.343
Because she is me!

04:02.376 --> 04:04.745
So I'm sorry, but no.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.547
Whatever happened
to that head of yours

04:06.580 --> 04:07.915
is not our fault.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.317
That's what
the president of Hollywood

04:09.350 --> 04:10.451
said to Britney Spears.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.653
Ah-ah, this is not over, miss.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.356
Until you give me
back my money,

04:15.389 --> 04:18.692
I'm putting a mojo
on you and yours,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.328
a hex...

04:20.361 --> 04:23.831
on everything you touch
and everything you do.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.866
So it is said,

04:25.899 --> 04:27.768
so it shall be done.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.803
(grunts quietly,
clicks tongue)

04:32.573 --> 04:35.443
(continues in
foreign language)

04:41.114 --> 04:44.652
That was Barack Obama's
middle name.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.920
And Obama-lu to you, too!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.489
Back home, my father thought

04:48.522 --> 04:50.924
someone put a hex
on his dinner.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.125
We're having soup
for dinner?

04:52.159 --> 04:56.330
Yeah. Drew and Tonya are sick--
they got a touch of the flu.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.065
The flu? They were
fine last night.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.433
They aren't
faking, are they?

04:59.467 --> 05:00.801
If she thought that,

05:00.834 --> 05:01.969
she'd have made fake soup.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.805
No. I took their temperature
with a rectal thermometer.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.574
Just one?
Either they
got the flu,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.976
or they're going
a long way for a joke.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.344
How about Chris?

05:10.378 --> 05:11.479
He's upstairs studying.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.114
He's trying to memorize
a speech for his history class.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.616
Where you been?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.117
Tattoo down
at the garage.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.752
The battery's dead.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.820
What?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.822
I know--
it's a brand-new battery.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
I told him you bought
a new one two months ago,

05:24.157 --> 05:26.794
and he said it looked like
it was four years old.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.995
I don't get it.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.398
He said it looked like
it was four years old?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.966
That's crazy.
Yeah, it's been
a crazy day.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.102
One bad thing happening
right after the other.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.905
I found out I had a
hole in my pocket,

05:37.938 --> 05:39.607
and I lost 89 cents.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.074
Aw!
Hey, are you okay?

05:41.108 --> 05:43.777
No, she's mad
she can't slap soup.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.614
Yeah. If that woman
wasn't so ridiculous,

05:46.647 --> 05:50.684
I swear I might really believe
she put a mojo on me for real.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.752
What woman

05:51.785 --> 05:53.721
What makes you think
you got a mojo?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.055
Oh, it was nothing.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.124
Some crazy woman
came in the shop,

05:57.157 --> 05:59.159
talking about she didn't
like the way we did her hair,

05:59.192 --> 06:01.028
she wanted her money back,
and I told her no,

06:01.061 --> 06:03.397
and she got mad
and said, oh, well,

06:03.431 --> 06:06.033
I'm gonna put a hex on,
mojo or something on you.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.435
Well, did this happen today?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.569
Yeah.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.037
Maybe we still have time.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.805
I'll stop by
Aunt Mousey's tomorrow

06:11.839 --> 06:14.742
on the way home from work
and get her mojo remedy.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.010
In the meantime, I'll just
get the kids some 'Tussin.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.780
No, no. You can feed 'em,
but don't give 'em medicine

06:19.813 --> 06:21.081
until you treat the mojo.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.417
Anything you do
might make it worse.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.420
Fine. Drew, Tanya, Chris,
get down here and eat this soup!

06:27.821 --> 06:28.956
Ow!

06:28.989 --> 06:30.758
I just bit my tongue.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.093
Mojo.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.998
Do we have to drink this?

06:38.031 --> 06:41.101
You don't have to do anything
but stay ugly and die.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.070
Yeah. We need to be
on the safe side.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.573
It looks like
Clay-Dough and grits.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.808
Ugh! It tastes like
Clay-Dough and grits.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.109
It is Clay-Dough and grits.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.145
If you treat the mojo
in the first 24 hours,

06:52.179 --> 06:53.814
you can stop it
from taking hold.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.083
Julius, can I, um, talk
to you for a minute?

06:56.116 --> 06:57.585
Yeah.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.419
Drink that.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.859
Why can't we just give the kids
some cough medicine?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.461
They have the flu, not the mojo.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.129
Well, let's be on the safe side.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.798
This cures the flu and the mojo.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.900
If there's no mojo,
then they won't get it.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.803
You're not making my kids
drink Clay-Dough and grits.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.538
Too late.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.739
* Watch out!

07:18.772 --> 07:21.174
JULIUS:
Good job.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.678
If they throw it up,
you clean it up.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.481
* I...

07:27.515 --> 07:29.082
* Put a spell...

07:33.020 --> 07:35.756
While Drew and Tanya
were trying not to throw up,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.991
I was trying
to get my speech down.

07:38.025 --> 07:38.992
"...in the early period..."

07:39.026 --> 07:42.195
"...that a most striking
contrast was observable

07:42.229 --> 07:44.665
in the conduct of..."

07:44.698 --> 07:46.700
After three days of studying,

07:46.734 --> 07:49.903
I was a lot like
William Henry Harrison: dead.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.004
Um...

07:51.038 --> 07:52.740
Come on, man, you can do this.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.508
This is too
much pressure.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.844
If I had, like, one more day,
maybe I'd have a shot at it.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.112
Well, I can't help you--
I've run out of ideas.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.080
It's, like,
you're cursed or something.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.683
So what am I gonna do?
This is a disaster.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.217
Dude, pull yourself together.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.119
Everything's gonna be all right.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.523
Really?
No. You're totally gonna
fail the tenth grade.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.525
That reminds me
of a funny story.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.960
My life is hanging by a thread,

08:12.993 --> 08:14.227
and you're gonna tell me
a funny story?

08:14.261 --> 08:18.098
:
Yeah, yeah. So, this one time,
my cousin Benny,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.967
he didn't study for
a test, either, right?

08:20.000 --> 08:24.171
:
So... he picks up a phone,
and he calls in a bomb threat,

08:24.204 --> 08:25.172
and they cancelled school.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.175
Right. Like, I'm gonna
call in a bomb threat.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.278
:
Hello. I have planted a bomb

08:31.311 --> 08:33.280
at Tattaglia High.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.083
Unless everybody's
out of that building

08:36.116 --> 08:38.619
in the next 40 minutes...

08:38.652 --> 08:40.921
everybody will be
out of that building

08:40.954 --> 08:43.123
in the next 40 minutes.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.097
In the '80s,
making a bomb threat

08:50.130 --> 08:52.933
was nowhere near
as easy as it is now.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.635
Sir, unless the bomb
is committing a crime,

08:54.668 --> 08:56.003
there's nothing we can do.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.338
Unless the bomb is up a tree
and can't get down,

08:58.371 --> 08:59.539
there's nothing we can do.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.743
I thought I finally got
the right people on the phone,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.244
but I still couldn't figure out

09:04.277 --> 09:06.213
why the school
wasn't being evacuated.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.717
Bomb. School. 40 minutes.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.720
Okay, you have a nice day.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.588
I'm going to lunch.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.257
Tell the Bomb Squad
they got a message.

09:22.395 --> 09:27.601
Back home, my dad's
mojo recipes were laying eggs.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.302
Honey, I've done
everything I can,

09:29.336 --> 09:30.938
and things just
keep getting worse.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.973
They've had over four
glasses of the remedy each,

09:33.006 --> 09:34.274
and their temperature
just keeps going up.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.076
Maybe that's because Clay-Dough

09:36.109 --> 09:38.979
is not the stuffy-nose,
runny-eyes,

09:39.012 --> 09:41.381
scratchy-throat and knock-you-
out-so-you-can-sleep medicine.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.183
Well, can you check
the kitchen drain?

09:43.216 --> 09:44.351
It's stopped up.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.252
Since when?

09:45.285 --> 09:46.854
I don't know-- it was slow

09:46.887 --> 09:48.922
a couple of days ago,
and now it's totally clogged.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.792
You know, this would all be over
if you just go apologize

09:51.825 --> 09:54.294
to that woman.
Well, I guess
it's not gonna be over,

09:54.327 --> 09:56.864
because I'm not gonna apologize
for being right.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.667
Men do it all the time.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.969
Breathe.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.839
If the Bomb Squad didn't get
the word soon,

10:05.873 --> 10:09.009
there was still gonna be
an explosion in my heart.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.177
Well, look who's here.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.079
We've all been
waiting for you.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.180
You have?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.715
Yeah. Why don't you start off

10:14.748 --> 10:16.650
with a few of those
"Yo, mama" jokes

10:16.684 --> 10:17.785
just to get the crowd going?

10:21.021 --> 10:23.056
All right, everybody,
don't panic!

10:23.090 --> 10:24.191
It's just a fire.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.894
Line up single file by the door.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.796
You know the drill.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.130
Dude, come on.
Snap out of it.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.164
My plan was working.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.399
Yes!

10:32.432 --> 10:36.336
While the fire alarm rang,
Drew and Tonya were burning up.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.806
So you just gonna go to work
and leave us like this?

10:38.839 --> 10:41.675
There is no mojo, Julius.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.542
The children are sick.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.210
You refuse to give them
real medicine.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.212
Just like the government.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.752
Ah, Ms. Rochelle,

10:51.785 --> 10:53.887
Mr. Julius, I just want
to tell you

10:53.921 --> 10:55.856
I might be a little
late on the rent.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.225
The mortuary had
a run of bad luck,

10:58.258 --> 11:01.729
and tragically, we lost
three customers.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.063
That means they lived.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.364
You see there,
Rochelle?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.133
The mojo's spreading
all over the building.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.401
Mojo
You got

11:08.435 --> 11:09.536
a mojo on you?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.404
Oh, don't tell me you believe
in that nonsense, too.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.174
I believe it
because it's not nonsense.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.175
I'm sorry,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.910
if you got a mojo on you,

11:16.944 --> 11:19.246
I got to move the hell
up out of here now.

11:19.279 --> 11:19.947
What for?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.481
'Cause you got a mojo on you,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.817
and I'm in this house,
I got a mojo on me.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.452
And if people keep
surviving around here,

11:25.485 --> 11:27.220
y'all gonna run me out
of business.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.791
So do what you need to do,
and let me know when it's done.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.425
That's what my wife says.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.428
See that?
Now we're losing a tenant.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.864
What else has to go wrong

11:36.897 --> 11:37.965
before you
take this seriously?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.499
Hey, Ma,
Chris's school.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.970
TV REPORTER:
Tattaglia High School in Queens
where just a short while ago,

11:43.003 --> 11:44.371
the Bomb Center received a call
threatening

11:44.404 --> 11:45.472
to blow up the school.

11:45.505 --> 11:49.977
So far, the school
is still there.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.211
So we'll be here with live,

11:51.244 --> 11:52.512
up-to-the-minute reporting.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.120
Now do you believe it?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.523
Where you been?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.358
I've been
at the emergency triage area

12:05.392 --> 12:06.293
with heart palpitations.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.028
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.797
How do you know?
This whole place could blow.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.899
Metal chairs flying
like shrapnel everywhere.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.767
Greg, I called in
the bomb threat.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.804
What?! Where would you get
such a crazy idea?

12:16.837 --> 12:19.206
From you, with that story
about your cousin Benny.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.276
Oh. I may have exaggerated
a bit.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.211
What's wrong with you?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.546
Why would you make up
a story like that?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.917
I have a penchant for hyperbole
to aggrandize myself.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.451
I've been working it out
with my shrink.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.822
Look, bottom line is, the
school is not gonna blow up.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.289
They're gonna send us
all home for the day,

12:36.323 --> 12:38.425
and I won't have to
recite that stupid speech.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.459
:
Attention, everyone:

12:39.492 --> 12:42.896
I'm Captain Tyrone Williams
of the Bomb Squad.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.800
The school has been cleared
and the bomb threat is over.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.535
Thank you for your cooperation.

12:48.568 --> 12:52.272
I've never seen a black man
on that side of a megaphone.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.075
We would send you all home,
but with finals next week,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.310
it's best if you go back
to your classes.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.112
So, we'll resume
with fifth period,

12:59.146 --> 13:02.482
and Tyrone will resume
searching my office
any my person.

13:02.515 --> 13:08.321
Hey, yo, mama, I'll see you
back in class, huh?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.857
Maybe if I
start you off,

13:09.890 --> 13:11.024
you'll remember
the speech.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.493
All right, it
starts like this.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.863
"Called from a retirement
in which I had supposed..."

13:15.896 --> 13:17.164
I don't know the speech,

13:17.197 --> 13:19.066
and I cannot go back
into that class!

13:19.099 --> 13:20.500
What are you gonna do?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.335
Panic!

13:30.610 --> 13:31.511
No, no, no!

13:34.414 --> 13:37.817
I didn't freak out like that
again until Big Puddin' died.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.558
There, there, Chris.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.228
It's perfectly natural
for you to freak out

13:48.261 --> 13:49.529
after a bomb scare.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.132
It's called Post-Traumatic
Stress Syndrome.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.401
But being from
the ghetto,

13:54.434 --> 13:56.603
it never occurred to me that
your stress would ever end.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.272
Miss Morello, I'm flippin' out.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.974
I think you should send me home.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.977
I tell you what,
go back to your class,

14:04.011 --> 14:05.578
and if you're still
feeling shaky after that,

14:05.612 --> 14:06.947
then you can go home.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.514
Thanks.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.949
That was as helpful

14:08.982 --> 14:11.484
as a bookshelf
at Paris Hilton's house.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.308
Ooh!

14:37.577 --> 14:39.913
Okay, um...

14:39.947 --> 14:43.483
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.053
Now, you would think that.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.189
Look, I was wrong, okay?

14:49.222 --> 14:49.756
Mm-hmm.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.624
And I just wanted to...

14:52.659 --> 14:55.428
...apologize for my attitude.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.697
Thank you so much
for coming by.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.665
Wait, wait, wait, now!

14:59.632 --> 15:02.202
I need you take off
this whammy, you know?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.670
The mojo hojo stuff.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.573
I thought you said you didn't
believe in all this stuff.

15:06.606 --> 15:11.144
I don't, but, you know,
everybody else around me does,

15:11.178 --> 15:13.947
so would you do that voodoo
that you do so well?

15:13.981 --> 15:14.914
Hmm.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.485
Well, I can fix you,
but it gonna cost you.

15:18.518 --> 15:23.423
Okay, you know, I knew that,
and here's your refund.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.196
All right.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.298
Tunde baba ashayokay.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.632
That's it?

15:32.665 --> 15:33.633
Uh-huh.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.701
That means

15:34.734 --> 15:36.603
"Thanks for the refund,
sucker."

15:36.636 --> 15:40.007
And put me on your book
for next Tuesday, 10:00.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.143
Well...

15:43.176 --> 15:46.146
hello, Chris.
Nice of you to join us.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.647
Oh, no, you don't!

15:47.680 --> 15:49.983
The front of the class, please.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.326
Now, class, if you
recall the other day,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.694
Chris ran his mouth off.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.432
Chris, did you
learn the speech?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.000
No.
Yeah.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.001
No!

16:08.035 --> 16:08.735
Good.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.403
Now take a seat.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.673
And don't ever talk
in my class again.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.108
Huh?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.477
Huh? You don't want me
to recite it?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.579
Recite it?

16:19.612 --> 16:23.016
Did I say you had
to recite it? No!

16:23.050 --> 16:25.685
I said for you
to memorize it!

16:25.718 --> 16:28.388
Maybe if you spent
more time listening

16:28.421 --> 16:30.157
and less time talking,

16:30.190 --> 16:32.592
you might have heard
me correctly.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.162
But I worked my butt off
learning this speech.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.729
What are you doing, fool?
Sit down!

16:36.763 --> 16:39.632
You know, it's interesting,
isn't it? Sometimes,

16:39.666 --> 16:40.800
to get people
to do things,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.735
we have to threaten
to do something,

16:42.769 --> 16:46.039
we really have
no intention of doing.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.141
Later on, North Korea would
follow the same advice

16:48.175 --> 16:50.577
and get billions of dollars
in foreign aid.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.681
Look, I memorized it,
I'm gonna recite it,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.449
and you're gonna
listen to it.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.617
Is that a fact?

16:57.650 --> 16:58.618
Sit down.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.787
"Called from a retirement
which I had supposed

17:00.820 --> 17:02.655
would continue for the
residue of my life...."

17:02.689 --> 17:03.756
That's enough.
You know it.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.392
Take your seat.
"...to fill the
chief executive

17:05.425 --> 17:07.760
office of this great
and free nation.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.096
Talk.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.830
"...which will govern me
in the duties

17:10.863 --> 17:13.833
of these discharge
which I had to perform."

17:13.866 --> 17:14.834
Enjoy. Good-bye.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.337
"I fear that a strict
examination of the annals

17:17.370 --> 17:19.739
"of some of the modern
elective governments

17:19.772 --> 17:23.710
would develop
similar instances of
violated confidence."

17:23.743 --> 17:25.512
"I, too, well understand
the dangerous temptations

17:25.545 --> 17:26.746
to which I shall be exposed

17:26.779 --> 17:28.115
"from the magnitude
of the power,

17:28.148 --> 17:29.582
which it has been
the pleasure..."

17:29.616 --> 17:32.352
CHRIS :
"If parties in a republic
are necessary to secure

17:32.385 --> 17:34.421
a degree of vigilance sufficient
to keep the public..."

17:34.454 --> 17:36.756
All right, all right!
I get it. Now leave me alone.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.159
You know the speech.
I'm sorry.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.193
Thank you.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.861
* We're not gonna take it...

17:41.894 --> 17:44.564
Chris, bring Vanessa a plate!

17:47.600 --> 17:49.369
Thank you.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.403
And something to drink, too.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.307
So, what's going on?

17:54.341 --> 17:55.708
Oh, I had to check with you.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.544
I was going over
my receipts,

17:57.577 --> 18:01.114
and my register keeps coming up
short about $40.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.750
My mom could have been
the mayor of Detroit.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.120
Oh... I meant to tell you
about that.

18:07.154 --> 18:07.854
About what?

18:07.887 --> 18:10.290
Um, you know Miss Tallulah?

18:10.323 --> 18:11.524
Yeah. What about her?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.661
Well, she was unhappy
with her hair color,

18:14.694 --> 18:17.830
so she seemed pretty upset,
so I just gave her a refund.

18:17.864 --> 18:22.335
Refund? What'd you
do that for?

18:22.369 --> 18:24.504
I have a strict no-refund
policy,

18:24.537 --> 18:25.672
you know that.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.841
Well, Vanessa,
she put a hex on me. A mojo!

18:28.875 --> 18:29.809
A mojo?

18:29.842 --> 18:31.178
You let that woman come in

18:31.211 --> 18:32.345
and scam you for $40

18:32.379 --> 18:33.380
because she threatened

18:33.413 --> 18:35.482
you with a mojo?

18:35.515 --> 18:38.151
She's been doing that
ever since she came in, 'Chelle.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.753
She's crazy! She's the reason
I put the sign up there.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.323
Oh, ooh, I got

18:43.356 --> 18:45.892
to watch TV when I eat.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.862
I can't believe you had me go
all the way down there

18:49.896 --> 18:52.865
and apologize
to that crazy woman for nothing!

18:52.899 --> 18:53.966
It wasn't for nothing.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.903
Drew and Tonya had a fever.
It was getting worse.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.505
That's because
we didn't drink

18:58.538 --> 18:59.539
that nasty mojo remedy.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.907
Yeah,

19:00.940 --> 19:02.842
we poured that
down the drain.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.312
I really don't think
it's safe to drink Clay-Dough.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.447
What about that battery?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.681
I mean,
it was brand-new.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.817
He said it looked like
it was four years old.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.353
Oh, th

19:13.386 --> 19:14.321
Yeah.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.822
Yeah, I used that money

19:15.855 --> 19:17.324
to buy a new outfit.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.694
What about the bomb threat
at Chris's school?

19:21.728 --> 19:25.432
Oh, um, it turned out
to be a hoax.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.868
It happens so much
that, you know,

19:28.901 --> 19:31.304
I think that's the reason why
they call it a "bomb threat."

19:31.338 --> 19:34.207
Because nobody
really calls in bombs.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.676
Oh, look, a school
just blew up!

19:36.709 --> 19:41.514
TV REPORTER:
I'm here at Bardini High
with Captain Tyrone Williams

19:41.548 --> 19:42.749
of the Bomb Squad.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.916
Can you tell us
what happened?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.319
Well, apparently, there was
a bomb inside the building

19:46.353 --> 19:48.355
and before we were
able to defuse it,

19:48.388 --> 19:50.390
it blew up and
destroyed the school.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.892
Okay. Can you tell us,
does this have anything

19:52.925 --> 19:55.862
to do with the bomb threat
earlier at Tattaglia?

19:55.895 --> 19:56.929
Oh, absolutely.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.232
Because there was
no bomb over there,

19:59.266 --> 20:00.900
we figured there was
no bomb over here,

20:00.933 --> 20:02.235
so we ignored
the call.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.304
Fortunately, it was
after hours

20:04.337 --> 20:07.274
so no students
were destroyed
in the blast.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.509
But whoever called in
that Tattaglia threat,

20:09.542 --> 20:12.379
we're holding you
personally responsible.

20:12.412 --> 20:16.549
Wherever you are, we will hunt
you down and blow you up.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.920
And that's not a threat,
that's a promise.

20:20.953 --> 20:26.259
* Everybody hates Chris.
