00:04.035 --> 00:05.899
<i>David and I love hanging out
with our little ones,</i>

00:05.900 --> 00:09.369
<i>but sometimes it feels like our lives
are overrun by kid stuff.</i>

00:09.404 --> 00:13.373
<i>From the content we watch
to the food we consume...</i>

00:13.408 --> 00:15.742
Would you like red or white
this evening, my darling?

00:15.777 --> 00:18.612
Well, I'm having fish sticks,
so... white.

00:19.325 --> 00:20.314
As requested.

00:20.348 --> 00:21.415
Ah, the good stuff.

00:21.449 --> 00:22.368
- Mm-hmm.
- Cheers.

00:22.417 --> 00:25.152
<i>Even the places we go
are all about the kids.</i>

00:25.186 --> 00:26.887
Oh, my God, Emerit.

00:26.921 --> 00:28.889
Are you guys just getting home too?

00:28.923 --> 00:30.457
- No.
- Oh, my God, Ren and I

00:30.491 --> 00:32.392
were at a sunrise dance party,

00:32.427 --> 00:36.163
and, like, honestly,
I've just never felt more alive.

00:36.197 --> 00:38.765
Can you feel my aura right now?

00:38.800 --> 00:44.738
Oh, I would, but we're actually
on our way to The Spaghetti Hole.

00:44.772 --> 00:45.639
- Oh.
- When I say

00:45.673 --> 00:47.808
"Spaghetti," you say "Hole."

00:47.842 --> 00:49.309
- Spaghetti.
- Hole.

00:49.444 --> 00:51.078
- Spaghetti.
- Hole.

00:51.112 --> 00:52.246
Hey, that's enough.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.580
Anyway, it's really good to see...

00:53.615 --> 00:54.815
And they're making out.

00:54.849 --> 00:56.750
All right, Spaghetti Hole.

00:56.784 --> 01:00.654
Babe, do you ever feel like
we don't go anywhere fun anymore?

01:00.688 --> 01:02.155
Are you a mind reader?

01:02.190 --> 01:03.590
Because it just so happens,
I have planned for us

01:03.625 --> 01:06.260
to go somewhere very fun this Friday.

01:06.294 --> 01:08.762
<i>Take that, sunrise dance freaks.</i>

01:08.796 --> 01:10.163
- Kev, oh, perfect.
- Kev?

01:10.198 --> 01:11.598
Hey, kids, come here for a second.

01:11.633 --> 01:12.866
Check this out. Ready? Check this out.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.334
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

01:14.369 --> 01:15.869
- I got a treat for you.
- All right.

01:15.903 --> 01:17.638
Hold on to your hats,
'cause this Friday,

01:17.672 --> 01:23.277
we are going to see your favorite
Korean teen pop sensation, MYTEEN.

01:23.311 --> 01:25.379
Oh, my God.

01:25.413 --> 01:27.214
Oh, my goodness, how did you get those?

01:27.248 --> 01:28.782
It's been sold out for months.

01:28.816 --> 01:31.285
Let's just say I know
a guy who knows a guy

01:31.319 --> 01:32.552
who knows a Korean.

01:32.587 --> 01:34.154
Oh, and I wish we couldn't.

01:34.188 --> 01:37.024
- Oh, my God!
- <i>They used to say life begins at 40,</i>

01:37.058 --> 01:39.493
<i>but mine just ended at 1:00 p.m.</i>

01:45.568 --> 01:48.502
_

01:51.839 --> 01:53.173
Hey, guys, big Monday,

01:53.207 --> 01:55.008
so let's hit the ground running, yeah?

01:55.043 --> 01:56.810
Whoa... whoa.

01:56.844 --> 01:58.245
What happened to you?

01:58.279 --> 01:59.880
He hit the ground
running with this face.

01:59.914 --> 02:01.481
We went to a club opening.

02:01.516 --> 02:02.849
Worth it for a great night out.

02:02.884 --> 02:04.584
Damn, you guys had a good weekend too?

02:04.619 --> 02:07.087
I mean, it's one thing
for my hot neighbors to have fun,

02:07.121 --> 02:07.988
but you losers?

02:08.021 --> 02:10.490
Say, we're just as surprised as you are.

02:10.525 --> 02:12.366
The club was frickin' sick.

02:12.401 --> 02:13.660
Afterwards, I got in a scooter race

02:13.695 --> 02:16.530
with the CEO of Tinder,
and I "swiped" out.

02:16.564 --> 02:17.864
I'm pretty sure he
got injured on purpose

02:17.899 --> 02:19.366
so he doesn't have to go to meetings.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.868
Sometimes you gotta hurt
yourself to save yourself.

02:21.903 --> 02:23.904
Dare I ask how your weekend was?

02:23.938 --> 02:25.672
Well, it started out the usual way.

02:25.707 --> 02:27.708
My parents ditched us because, you know,

02:27.742 --> 02:29.943
they refuse to take the kids
for the weekend, ever.

02:29.977 --> 02:32.346
But we went to Spaghetti Hole,
where we had our own

02:32.380 --> 02:33.780
little celebrity sighting.

02:33.815 --> 02:36.249
Yeah, Mr. Reynolds, kids' principal.

02:36.284 --> 02:38.218
- He was there...
- Oh, my God, you gotta stop.

02:38.252 --> 02:39.686
Your life sucks.

02:39.721 --> 02:41.254
Oh, it's not that bad.

02:41.289 --> 02:43.357
This is just what everyone
with kids goes through,

02:43.391 --> 02:46.026
and then they move out of the house,
and you get your life back.

02:46.060 --> 02:47.294
I'm just doing the maths,
and by the time

02:47.328 --> 02:48.562
the baby goes to college,

02:48.596 --> 02:50.597
you'll be... what, 60?

02:51.733 --> 02:54.401
The next time I go into a club,
I'll have wandered in by accident.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.703
Better go in now before
your boobs have fallen

02:56.738 --> 02:58.705
and they can't get up.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.707
We're on the guest list for this Friday.

03:00.742 --> 03:01.708
You and David should go.

03:02.082 --> 03:02.876
I can't.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.378
We're taking the kids to a concert.

03:04.412 --> 03:06.146
Well, let us know
if you change your mind.

03:06.180 --> 03:06.980
We can't go.

03:07.014 --> 03:08.715
We gotta look after this little guy.

03:10.251 --> 03:12.052
I'm fine.
I can take care of myself, bitches.

03:12.086 --> 03:14.488
I just need, you know,
someone to help clip my toenails.

03:14.522 --> 03:15.655
Who's gonna jump on that grenade?

03:15.690 --> 03:16.951
Hoo-ooh.

03:17.759 --> 03:19.126
<i>It was the night of the concert,</i>

03:19.160 --> 03:20.427
<i>and I couldn't help thinking...</i>

03:20.461 --> 03:21.962
MYTEEN! MYTEEN!

03:21.996 --> 03:24.771
<i>Only 17 more years of
these Friday nights.</i>

03:24.806 --> 03:26.400
<i>I can power through this, right?</i>

03:26.434 --> 03:27.801
How great is that?

03:27.835 --> 03:29.336
Pom-pom for the mom-mom.

03:29.370 --> 03:31.938
Yeah. Hey, David, do you ever feel like

03:31.973 --> 03:35.142
we never just do anything
fun for just us anymore?

03:35.176 --> 03:36.443
Yeah, I get what you're saying,

03:36.477 --> 03:37.778
but we can fix that.

03:37.812 --> 03:39.846
I mean, how about tonight
after the concert,

03:39.881 --> 03:42.849
we come home, we get into bed,
we turn off the lights,

03:42.884 --> 03:44.317
and then we finally find out

03:44.352 --> 03:46.953
what all this "Game of Thrones"
fuss is all about?

03:48.956 --> 03:51.091
Here, take these healthy snacks.

03:51.125 --> 03:54.027
Don't eat that filthy concession food.

03:54.061 --> 03:56.830
I know a guy who got a hot dog,
then he got botulism,

03:56.864 --> 03:57.831
and then he died.

03:57.865 --> 03:59.666
Okay. Have loads of fun.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.435
And remember, if you need anything,

04:01.469 --> 04:02.669
don't call us.

04:02.703 --> 04:04.805
It's the freakin' weekend, baby,

04:04.839 --> 04:06.940
and Grandpa and I have a life.

04:06.974 --> 04:08.608
Check it out, you guys.
Who's always thinking?

04:08.643 --> 04:09.976
Concert fanny...

04:10.011 --> 04:12.345
so these are free to do a lot of this.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.281
Hey, MYTEEN.

04:14.315 --> 04:15.098
<i>And that was it.</i>

04:15.183 --> 04:16.658
<i>If I didn't take drastic action,</i>

04:16.718 --> 04:18.851
<i>I'd be doing this every
weekend until I'm old.</i>

04:18.886 --> 04:20.387
Hey!

04:20.421 --> 04:21.822
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

04:21.856 --> 04:23.290
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

04:23.324 --> 04:25.959
<i>Okay, there's no way for David and me
to get a night to ourselves.</i>

04:25.993 --> 04:27.192
<i>And like Griff said,</i>

04:27.262 --> 04:29.062
<i>you have to hurt yourself
to save yourself.</i>

04:29.096 --> 04:31.465
- Are you okay?
- Oh. No, it's okay.

04:31.499 --> 04:32.732
I'm okay.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.334
- I'm just a little dazed.
- What happened?

04:34.368 --> 04:36.303
Oh, I just...
I ran outside to get something,

04:36.337 --> 04:38.538
and I just didn't realize
the door was shut.

04:38.573 --> 04:40.207
How did you not see the glass?

04:40.241 --> 04:41.812
It's so filthy.

04:42.476 --> 04:44.678
- You know, I should get...
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Do not get up.

04:44.712 --> 04:46.813
- You might have a concussion.
- Oh, but the kids' concert.

04:46.848 --> 04:48.315
I gotta take the kids to the concert.

04:48.349 --> 04:50.217
Don't worry about that. We'll take them.

04:50.251 --> 04:52.152
We'll keep them the entire weekend.

04:52.186 --> 04:53.887
<i>Oh, bonus.</i>

04:53.921 --> 04:55.255
David, you should take her
to get checked out.

04:55.289 --> 04:57.057
- Okay, I will.
- Yeah, Daddy's right.

04:57.494 --> 04:58.325
Kids, kids,

04:58.359 --> 04:59.559
hey, listen, I'm so sorry.

04:59.594 --> 05:01.161
You know what? You guys have fun, okay?

05:01.195 --> 05:03.263
And don't worry about Mommy.
I will be fine.

05:03.297 --> 05:05.866
- Okay, bye, Mom.
- Bye. Hope you get well.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.001
All right, Sonny,

05:08.035 --> 05:09.836
you're gonna need this.

05:09.871 --> 05:11.872
Go with God. Thank you.

05:11.906 --> 05:13.507
All right, I'm calling the doctor.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.041
Don't fall asleep. Keep your eyes on me.

05:15.076 --> 05:16.578
Whoa...

05:17.411 --> 05:18.678
David, we're going out.

05:19.172 --> 05:21.681
Yeah, we're gonna hit the clubs
harder than I hit that door, which...

05:21.716 --> 05:23.049
ooh, was actually pretty hard.

05:23.084 --> 05:25.785
I think I need to...
whoa, sit for just one sec.

05:28.633 --> 05:29.522
Worth it.

05:30.587 --> 05:33.546
You know, I feel like there
were probably other ways

05:33.555 --> 05:34.957
for us to get a weekend together

05:35.057 --> 05:38.392
other than you bashing
your brains into the glass.

05:38.426 --> 05:39.493
- Really, David?
- Yeah.

05:39.527 --> 05:40.627
What ways?

05:40.662 --> 05:42.029
Can you think of any other ways?

05:42.063 --> 05:43.368
Okay, I do see your point.

05:43.398 --> 05:46.800
And I would say,
in spite of myself, I am excited.

05:46.834 --> 05:47.834
- Right?
- Yeah.

05:47.869 --> 05:51.338
Babe, I wanna do the things
we used to do when we first met, okay?

05:51.372 --> 05:52.739
- Being adventurous.
- Mm-hmm.

05:52.774 --> 05:55.475
I wanna go to a club
and dance until last call

05:55.510 --> 05:57.144
and then come home, try to do it,

05:57.178 --> 06:00.347
but give up and then just pass out
and sleep until noon.

06:00.381 --> 06:02.416
I feel like we've, like,
fallen into a spaghetti hole

06:02.450 --> 06:04.718
and we're, like,
desperately trying to crawl our way out

06:04.752 --> 06:07.721
and right when we get to the top,
they just throw more spaghetti on us.

06:07.755 --> 06:09.489
Oh, my God, that is exactly how I feel.

06:09.524 --> 06:10.731
Baby.

06:10.758 --> 06:12.092
- Ooh, you know what?
- What?

06:12.126 --> 06:13.560
I'm gonna get myself all cleaned up...

06:13.594 --> 06:14.561
- Yeah.
- And I'm gonna put on

06:14.595 --> 06:15.729
some Michael Jordan cologne.

06:15.763 --> 06:17.164
- Yeah, you are.
- Mm-hmm.

06:17.198 --> 06:17.964
Ooh!

06:23.471 --> 06:25.072
Okay, you know what, babe?

06:25.106 --> 06:26.673
For not being in one of these things

06:26.708 --> 06:28.995
for, like, 13 years,
I'd say we look pretty hot.

06:29.077 --> 06:29.976
I agree.

06:30.045 --> 06:32.575
I mean, I think it's 'cause it's dark
and everyone looks good in the dark,

06:32.647 --> 06:33.607
but I will take it.

06:33.682 --> 06:36.216
Oh, sorry about that, Pops.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.851
All right, okay. He called me "Pops."

06:37.885 --> 06:39.352
- I know.
- Yeah.

06:39.387 --> 06:41.288
I mean, these kids are,
like, closer to Lily's age

06:41.322 --> 06:42.689
than to our age.

06:42.724 --> 06:45.392
I mean, like, mathematically closer.

06:45.426 --> 06:47.561
Okay, why are men using math

06:47.595 --> 06:48.962
to make me feel like crap this week?

06:48.996 --> 06:50.630
- Can we just dance?
- Okay.

06:50.665 --> 06:51.456
Yeah.

06:51.566 --> 06:54.101
- Tootsee Roll?
- Yeah, do it, bitch.

06:54.135 --> 06:55.268
No, you got it.

06:55.303 --> 06:56.770
I can't "to the left, to the left"

06:56.804 --> 06:58.305
or "to the right, to the right"

06:58.339 --> 06:59.440
with whatever this crap is.

06:59.541 --> 07:02.309
I'm just gonna... You dance.
I'll watch coolly...

07:02.343 --> 07:04.711
Hey, if he doesn't wanna dance with you,

07:04.746 --> 07:06.046
I'll step in, Mami.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.380
- Oh, um...
- Okay, that's my Mami.

07:07.415 --> 07:08.448
- Okay?
- That's...

07:08.483 --> 07:09.251
Yeah.

07:09.284 --> 07:10.751
I don't know about this vibe, Emet.

07:10.785 --> 07:11.885
I don't know.

07:11.919 --> 07:14.121
<i>Ugh, David's being a drag.</i>

07:14.155 --> 07:15.155
Okay, you know what?

07:15.189 --> 07:16.957
Why don't you go talk to
the DJ like you used to?

07:16.991 --> 07:19.223
- Musician to musician.
- Yeah, I used to do that.

07:19.327 --> 07:20.694
They respect someone who
speaks their language.

07:20.728 --> 07:21.962
- They do. Let's go.
- Yeah.

07:21.996 --> 07:23.597
Yeah, let's go.

07:23.631 --> 07:25.132
Hey, hey.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.600
Right here, hey.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.168
Um, fellow musician.

07:28.846 --> 07:30.103
Oh, God.

07:30.138 --> 07:32.239
Hey, I was wondering,
do you have anything

07:32.273 --> 07:33.039
maybe a little funkier,

07:33.074 --> 07:34.975
like "Tootsee Roll," Black Eyed Peas,

07:35.009 --> 07:36.810
kind of a Fatboy Slim jam kinda thing?

07:39.514 --> 07:40.847
Is that a yes?

07:40.882 --> 07:42.582
DJ Robocall wants you to leave now.

07:42.617 --> 07:44.751
Uh, yeah, message received.

07:44.786 --> 07:47.120
Oh, I hate it here.

07:47.155 --> 07:49.022
Um, yeah, I think I'm done.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.490
- What? No.
- Yeah.

07:50.525 --> 07:51.308
Okay, David, listen to me.

07:51.326 --> 07:54.094
By the time Jake is out of the house,
we are going to be in our 60s.

07:54.128 --> 07:56.096
Can you please just
try to have some fun?

07:56.130 --> 07:57.330
- Please?
- Okay, fine.

07:57.365 --> 07:58.112
But just so you know,

07:58.133 --> 08:00.333
somewhere between
our first and third kid,

08:00.368 --> 08:01.968
we aged out of this.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.837
Or I did. You're still getting hit on,
which is good.

08:03.871 --> 08:05.138
I'm gonna get 1,000 drinks now.

08:05.173 --> 08:06.339
- Honey, no.
- Scuse me.

08:06.374 --> 08:07.088
Listen...

08:07.575 --> 08:09.509
<i>Look at him.
He's doing the Charlie Brown walk.</i>

08:09.544 --> 08:11.778
<i>This night out is
really starting to suck.</i>

08:11.813 --> 08:14.848
- Yeah, that was awesome!
- That was awesome!

08:14.882 --> 08:18.685
What do you say to Grandma and Grandpa
for taking you to the concert?

08:18.719 --> 08:21.021
Thank you, Grandma and Grandpa.

08:21.055 --> 08:23.223
I'm bored. Can we go to laser tag?

08:23.257 --> 08:26.660
No, not laser tag.
Fuddruckers for banana splits.

08:26.694 --> 08:27.961
I change mine. I want that.

08:27.995 --> 08:29.830
Hey, you're not home

08:29.864 --> 08:31.832
where your every whim is catered to.

08:31.866 --> 08:33.799
You know, people of our generation

08:33.835 --> 08:36.837
think children should fit quietly
into the lives of adults.

08:36.871 --> 08:38.471
So either go to bed, or help us prepare

08:38.506 --> 08:40.807
for the grown-up party
we're having later on.

08:45.179 --> 08:47.547
<i>If I can't make David
feel better about himself,</i>

08:47.582 --> 08:49.649
<i>our fun weekend is screwed.</i>

08:51.886 --> 08:53.753
<i>Hmm, she looks hot and crazy.</i>

08:53.788 --> 08:55.222
<i>Getting an idea.</i>

08:55.256 --> 08:57.357
Hi, hi, sorry. I'm Emet.

08:57.391 --> 09:00.527
You look like you could use
another... mojito?

09:00.561 --> 09:01.995
Oh, my God, yeah. I love mint.

09:02.029 --> 09:03.230
Who doesn't, right?

09:03.264 --> 09:05.165
- I'm Kylie.
- Hi, Ky-ky.

09:05.199 --> 09:07.234
Listen, see that guy over there?

09:07.268 --> 09:11.338
That is my husband, and he just needs
a little self-esteem boost.

09:11.372 --> 09:14.574
I got your drinks for the night
if you just flirt with him a little bit?

09:14.609 --> 09:17.677
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever heard in my whole life.

09:17.712 --> 09:19.112
Oh, I'm so glad. See, I love him.

09:19.146 --> 09:20.914
I just think he's in
a little bit of a rut.

09:20.948 --> 09:22.549
You ever been to The Spaghetti Hole?

09:22.583 --> 09:23.884
Yeah, I don't do that.

09:23.918 --> 09:25.085
Oh, no, no, no, no. Sorry.

09:25.119 --> 09:26.519
That's just a restaurant.

09:26.554 --> 09:28.688
Anyway, doesn't matter.
He's a great guy,

09:28.723 --> 09:29.856
and we just need to pep him back up.

09:29.891 --> 09:31.458
Say no more. I got you, girl.

09:31.492 --> 09:32.859
Thank you, girl.

09:35.296 --> 09:38.899
Hey are you in my econ class at State?

09:38.933 --> 09:40.133
Me?

09:40.167 --> 09:42.769
Wow, I do look good in the dark.

09:47.842 --> 09:50.543
So what do you think of the
recent political climate?

09:50.578 --> 09:51.611
I think it sucks.

09:51.646 --> 09:53.413
Whoa, well said, young man.

09:53.447 --> 09:55.815
You know, you're the kind of guy
that should be running things.

09:55.850 --> 09:56.950
True.

09:56.984 --> 09:58.418
Louie, it's almost bedtime.

09:58.452 --> 10:00.720
- Did you go pee-pee?
- Grandpa, please.

10:00.755 --> 10:02.255
We're discussing the state of the world.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.624
I'm sorry, Sai, where were we?

10:04.659 --> 10:07.460
Those animals ate all my tortilla chips.

10:07.495 --> 10:10.563
Now I have to dip into my
stash of airplane pretzels.

10:10.598 --> 10:12.799
Keep Pearl company.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.968
Hi, I'm Lily.

10:15.002 --> 10:17.404
You wanna know the
secret to keeping a man?

10:17.438 --> 10:18.772
I love secrets.

10:18.806 --> 10:20.941
Don't poop until he leaves for work.

10:20.975 --> 10:23.610
Good to know.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.348
<i>God, it really is hard to dance to this.</i>

10:28.382 --> 10:31.207
<i>Drop the beat already.
It's been, like, 15 minutes.</i>

10:31.242 --> 10:33.253
<i>On the other hand, my plan is working.</i>

10:33.287 --> 10:35.488
<i>David's finally feeling
good about himself.</i>

10:35.523 --> 10:38.959
<i>Oh, a little giggle, a little arm touch.</i>

10:38.993 --> 10:41.194
<i>He's flexing. Yeah, it's working.</i>

10:41.228 --> 10:44.664
<i>Now it's time to have a sexy,
fun night with my man.</i>

10:44.699 --> 10:46.099
- Hey, hottie.
- Hey.

10:46.133 --> 10:47.133
- You look hot.
- Yeah?

10:47.168 --> 10:48.635
Did I miss anything?

10:48.669 --> 10:49.869
I don't know what you missed,
but I missed dat ass.

10:49.904 --> 10:51.104
Ooh.

10:51.138 --> 10:53.006
I don't know. I feel alive

10:53.040 --> 10:55.375
and attractive for no particular reason.

10:55.409 --> 10:57.344
<i>Yes, you're a genius, Emet.</i>

10:57.378 --> 10:59.112
By the way, that Michael Jordan cologne

10:59.146 --> 11:01.181
is combining with your natural musk,

11:01.215 --> 11:03.950
and I am vibing it to the moon.

11:03.985 --> 11:04.828
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:04.919 --> 11:06.133
- You know who else liked it?
- Hmm?

11:06.154 --> 11:08.621
That girl you bribed to flirt with me.

11:08.656 --> 11:10.357
Her dad wears the same cologne.

11:10.391 --> 11:13.026
<i>Damn it, why do they always
have to have dads?</i>

11:13.060 --> 11:14.361
You know, Emet,
I didn't think I could feel

11:14.395 --> 11:16.129
worse about tonight, but somehow

11:16.163 --> 11:17.864
you managed to make that happen.

11:17.898 --> 11:19.199
I'm done.

11:19.233 --> 11:20.633
Wait, wait, wait. David, come on.

11:20.668 --> 11:21.835
We got one free weekend

11:21.869 --> 11:23.370
that I ran into a door to get us,

11:23.404 --> 11:25.805
and you can't even try
to have a good time?

11:25.840 --> 11:28.274
Maybe you're just not that fun anymore.

11:29.510 --> 11:30.310
Wow.

11:30.841 --> 11:32.912
David, wait. I didn't mean it like...

11:34.215 --> 11:36.383
Oh, great, now you drop the beat.

11:40.044 --> 11:42.001
<i>After David and I both
went to sleep mad,</i>

11:42.107 --> 11:43.215
<i>I was bracing myself.</i>

11:43.242 --> 11:45.482
<i>He has a way of pouting
with his whole body.</i>

11:45.576 --> 11:46.677
<i>Watch, I'm gonna touch him,</i>

11:46.745 --> 11:50.280
<i>and he's gonna do his
Taylor Swift shoulder roll.</i>

11:50.314 --> 11:55.051
- Hey, morning.
- Okay, in my defense, I...

11:55.086 --> 11:56.686
Wait, are we not in a fight?

11:56.721 --> 11:58.221
I will admit,
I was pretty upset last night.

11:58.255 --> 12:01.624
I mean, I had a nightmare
that was one long scream.

12:01.659 --> 12:03.793
But then I thought about it.
You're right.

12:03.828 --> 12:06.173
I have lost my sense of fun lately,
and I wanna get it back.

12:06.231 --> 12:09.499
So today I have something
amazing planned for us.

12:09.533 --> 12:12.402
Oh, honey, this is why I married you.

12:13.368 --> 12:15.405
- Okay, where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

12:15.439 --> 12:16.906
- Okay.
- Dress for adventure.

12:16.941 --> 12:20.143
Today you're gonna have
the best time of your life.

12:22.046 --> 12:24.514
Today she's gonna have
the worst time of her life.

12:24.548 --> 12:26.750
Wow, paying a woman to flirt with you

12:26.784 --> 12:28.518
- 'cause you're too boring.
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.552 --> 12:29.753
Your wife is off the deep end, man.

12:29.787 --> 12:31.154
Yeah, she says I'm not fun?

12:31.188 --> 12:32.989
She's not fun, and I'm gonna prove it.

12:33.023 --> 12:35.725
I'm gonna hold her feet to the fun fire
until she cries uncle.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.160
Hey, do you want me to wear a wire?

12:37.194 --> 12:38.928
'Cause I'm the perfect
body type to wear a wire.

12:38.963 --> 12:40.764
You can pat me down
and you don't feel nothing.

12:40.798 --> 12:41.998
No, I think we're good.

12:42.032 --> 12:43.533
Thank you for listening, though.

12:43.567 --> 12:44.768
- Okay, we're almost there.
- Oh, my God,

12:44.802 --> 12:46.169
I can't believe you did this.

12:46.203 --> 12:47.604
- Okay, stop, stop, stop. Okay.
- Yeah.

12:47.638 --> 12:48.772
- Ready to take it off?
- Yeah.

12:48.806 --> 12:50.406
And blindfold coming off, and..

12:50.441 --> 12:51.775
I am. I am. I am. I am. I am.

12:51.809 --> 12:54.277
Behold, the Dive Devil.

12:57.214 --> 12:58.078
You said you wanted adventures.

12:58.182 --> 13:00.216
We used to do this kind
of thing all the time.

13:00.251 --> 13:03.419
I mean, yeah, babe,
when we were stupid kids,

13:03.454 --> 13:04.621
but we're adults now.

13:04.655 --> 13:06.456
Why would we do that to ourselves?

13:06.490 --> 13:08.258
W-well, that's interesting,

13:08.292 --> 13:10.960
'cause when I felt out of
place at the nightclub,

13:10.995 --> 13:11.928
I was not fun.

13:11.962 --> 13:14.130
But when you're a total
buzzkill at my thing,

13:14.165 --> 13:15.799
you're an "adult."

13:15.833 --> 13:18.401
How convenient,
'cause you said I was not fun,

13:18.435 --> 13:21.070
but maybe you're not fun.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.389
- You said we weren't in a fight.
- I lied.

13:24.409 --> 13:26.033
And I guess if I'm wrong,
you'll prove it.

13:26.110 --> 13:29.212
So strap in, sister,
'cause we are going on this ride.

13:32.039 --> 13:33.917
I got it.

13:33.951 --> 13:36.986
Hi, Virginia. Hi, Pearl.

13:37.021 --> 13:38.154
Hi, Lily.

13:38.189 --> 13:40.757
Sai, Pearl, did we have plans?

13:40.791 --> 13:42.625
No, we have plans.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.828
My man Sai's gonna teach
me how to play racquetball,

13:44.862 --> 13:46.596
and then we're gonna hang
in the community center

13:46.630 --> 13:47.997
and read obits.

13:48.032 --> 13:50.300
And I'm teaching the ladies dance moves.

13:51.108 --> 13:53.169
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.105
<i>♪ We comin' to paint the town ♪</i>

13:56.140 --> 13:59.409
I can't believe those geezers
stole our grandkids.

13:59.443 --> 14:02.612
Excuse me, is the baby home?

14:02.646 --> 14:04.447
I wanna smell it.

14:04.481 --> 14:05.982
Dear God.

14:06.016 --> 14:08.885
Hide Jakey and find her
something else to smell.

14:11.155 --> 14:12.689
- Excuse me, David.
- Yes?

14:12.723 --> 14:14.858
I was just trying to
have a nice night out,

14:14.892 --> 14:16.442
which if anyone needs, you do.

14:16.697 --> 14:18.677
Um, you listen to Kidz Bop
without the kids.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.964
Yeah, it's all the beat
and none of the filth.

14:20.998 --> 14:22.599
And if I'm not fun anymore,

14:22.633 --> 14:24.701
maybe it's because you made me that way.

14:24.735 --> 14:26.536
- Me? How?
- Mm-hmm.

14:26.570 --> 14:28.497
I used to be a musician,
I loved to travel,

14:28.573 --> 14:30.974
I auditioned for the
"Real World" so many times,

14:31.008 --> 14:33.142
and I gave it all up so
I could get a stable job

14:33.177 --> 14:34.644
so that you could be an artist.

14:34.678 --> 14:36.179
And instead of appreciating that,

14:36.213 --> 14:37.435
you're obviously bored by me.

14:37.515 --> 14:40.350
How dare you blame
our terrible life on me?

14:40.384 --> 14:41.718
- Mm-hmm.
- It's work.

14:41.752 --> 14:43.720
Yes, I know it's work. It's a marriage.

14:43.754 --> 14:45.622
- No, it's work calling.
- Oh.

14:45.656 --> 14:46.723
What?

14:46.757 --> 14:48.291
- Whoa.
- Hostile.

14:48.325 --> 14:49.459
That was very hostile.

14:49.838 --> 14:50.693
Sorry.

14:50.728 --> 14:51.895
<i>I'm in the middle of a thing.</i>

14:51.929 --> 14:52.896
<i>Okay, what do you need?</i>

14:52.930 --> 14:54.054
So we're looking after Griff

14:54.065 --> 14:55.388
<i>while he heals from his fall,</i>

14:55.399 --> 14:56.666
<i>and quick question:</i>

14:56.700 --> 14:59.869
can we give Griff
both acetaminophen and ibuprofen?

14:59.904 --> 15:01.304
Because we did that.

15:01.338 --> 15:02.739
Yes, it is fine.

15:02.773 --> 15:04.340
He will probably have
some odd-colored poop,

15:04.375 --> 15:06.009
but what else is new?

15:06.043 --> 15:07.877
<i>Okay, listen,
while I have you guys on the phone,</i>

15:07.912 --> 15:10.413
<i>David just told me that he
gave up an exciting life</i>

15:10.447 --> 15:11.881
<i>so I could pursue my career.</i>

15:11.916 --> 15:13.483
I never knew he felt that way.

15:13.517 --> 15:15.084
<i>Wow, deep cut.</i>

15:15.119 --> 15:17.020
I know, and at first, I was mad.

15:17.054 --> 15:19.055
But now I think I did do that.

15:19.089 --> 15:22.258
And I vaguely remember a
conversation 11 years ago

15:22.293 --> 15:25.194
about flexible hours and
putting his dreams on hold.

15:25.229 --> 15:28.665
And now he's about to
ride this Dive Devil ride

15:28.699 --> 15:30.667
just to feel alive again.

15:31.735 --> 15:33.236
Christmas Day.

15:33.270 --> 15:34.283
<i>You guys.</i>

15:34.339 --> 15:37.941
Emet, as a docile,
accommodating human being,

15:37.975 --> 15:40.176
I recognize a brethren.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.445
David's bluffing.

15:42.479 --> 15:44.948
- Wait, you think so?
- Uh, for sure.

15:44.982 --> 15:46.282
Last time we were at your house,

15:46.317 --> 15:47.583
he wouldn't even let
us stand next to him

15:47.618 --> 15:48.952
while he lit the barbecue.

15:48.986 --> 15:51.854
There's no way he's going
on some thrill plunge.

15:51.889 --> 15:53.423
<i>He's making a point.</i>

15:53.457 --> 15:55.191
Oh, my God, you're right.

15:55.225 --> 15:57.460
How dare he use my
accomplishments against me?

15:57.494 --> 16:00.029
Okay, you know what?
I am calling his bluff.

16:00.064 --> 16:01.898
And then he's gonna have to admit

16:01.932 --> 16:04.133
I'm not the reason he's boring; he is.

16:04.168 --> 16:05.868
And then we can get a funnel cake.

16:06.102 --> 16:09.135
Hey, guys. Hey, guys, my poop is blue.

16:09.173 --> 16:10.330
You gotta see this.

16:10.341 --> 16:11.419
Emet, we have to go.

16:11.476 --> 16:13.443
Yeah, we really have to see this.

16:13.477 --> 16:15.445
Okay.

16:15.479 --> 16:17.046
Pardon me.

16:17.081 --> 16:19.148
- Baby...
- Hmm?

16:19.183 --> 16:20.316
You were right.

16:20.351 --> 16:21.651
- I was?
- Yes.

16:21.685 --> 16:24.587
I have been holding you
back all these years.

16:24.621 --> 16:25.502
And I'm sorry.

16:25.523 --> 16:27.724
You know what?
I am done being your anchor.

16:27.758 --> 16:28.992
Let's go ride the ride.

16:29.026 --> 16:31.160
- Yeah?
- Yes.

16:31.195 --> 16:32.662
- Excellent.
- Okay.

16:32.696 --> 16:33.896
Yeah.

16:33.931 --> 16:34.738
Ooh, I gotta go to the bathroom.

16:34.766 --> 16:36.257
Can you hold just one second?
Hold our spot.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.268
- I'll hold it.
- Okay.

16:37.301 --> 16:38.318
Not gonna move.

16:38.403 --> 16:41.070
<i>Gauntlet thrown. He's backing down.</i>

16:41.105 --> 16:43.172
<i>Your plan was to take her on Dive Devil?</i>

16:43.207 --> 16:44.207
<i>That's brilliant, my friend.</i>

16:44.241 --> 16:45.542
No, she's supposed to bail,

16:45.576 --> 16:47.310
and then I'm gonna
turn the tables on her

16:47.344 --> 16:50.013
and prove to her that she's
the one that's not fun anymore.

16:50.047 --> 16:51.281
But she's not bailing.

16:51.315 --> 16:53.059
That's [bleep]. She's bluffing.

16:53.094 --> 16:54.317
I can tell and I'm not even there.

16:54.351 --> 16:56.386
<i>She wouldn't take a risk like that;
she's a mother.</i>

16:56.420 --> 16:58.722
She makes you fly on separate planes
whenever you go anywhere.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.291
O-M-God, you are right.

17:01.325 --> 17:02.792
Oh, man, it is on.

17:02.827 --> 17:04.327
She's playing chicken
with the wrong rooster.

17:04.361 --> 17:06.396
I'm so sick of that woman.

17:06.430 --> 17:07.664
Okay, Kevin, come on.

17:07.698 --> 17:08.698
I still love her. Take it easy.

17:08.733 --> 17:09.866
I'm sorry. I know.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.067
I came in too hot on that one.

17:11.102 --> 17:12.301
It's fine. It's fine.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.839
All right, empty bladder,
full heart, can't lose.

17:15.873 --> 17:17.540
It's go time.

17:17.575 --> 17:19.576
- Um, what?
- Oh, yeah, we're next.

17:19.609 --> 17:22.311
Are you tingling? I'm tingling all over.

17:22.346 --> 17:23.713
So much tingling.

17:23.748 --> 17:25.248
<i>Okay, called that wrong.</i>

17:25.281 --> 17:26.750
<i>David wasn't faking.</i>

17:26.784 --> 17:28.162
<i>Excuse me for a second.</i>

17:31.849 --> 17:33.727
<i>Okay, David's not taking the bait.</i>

17:33.842 --> 17:35.853
<i>I gotta go at him hard
and get off this thing,</i>

17:35.877 --> 17:37.529
<i>'cause there's no way
I'm gonna scream-pee</i>

17:37.578 --> 17:38.745
<i>my way through this ride.</i>

17:38.779 --> 17:39.636
You know what, David?

17:39.647 --> 17:41.314
You wanna quit your job
and become a musician,

17:41.348 --> 17:42.649
just do it, okay?

17:42.683 --> 17:44.077
- I support you.
- Fine.

17:44.185 --> 17:45.728
Monday morning,
I'm gonna call Sunway Airlines.

17:45.821 --> 17:48.222
Monday afternoon, I am back on the road.

17:48.322 --> 17:49.012
- Great.
- Yeah.

17:49.023 --> 17:50.742
Yeah, do it. You know what? Why wait?

17:50.792 --> 17:52.826
Hey, just call 'em now.
We can get off this thing.

17:52.860 --> 17:54.294
Yeah, if that's the way you want it.

17:54.328 --> 17:55.328
- It is.
- Fine.

17:57.008 --> 17:58.698
All right, folks.

17:58.732 --> 18:01.334
Once you're up, the only way down
is by pulling the ripcord.

18:01.368 --> 18:04.270
Enjoy your plummet into
extreme exhilaration.

18:04.305 --> 18:06.106
Cody, taking my break.

18:06.140 --> 18:07.474
No, no, no, wait.

18:07.508 --> 18:08.975
Excuse me, I thought he was gonna bail.

18:09.009 --> 18:10.677
What? I thought she was gonna bail.

18:10.711 --> 18:12.846
He was definitely the bailer.
Please come back.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.281
- I want out.
- I don't wanna do this one!

18:15.316 --> 18:16.816
- What have we done?
- I don't know.

18:16.851 --> 18:18.618
- What have we done?
- You did this.

18:18.652 --> 18:20.030
Oh, my God, who's gonna raise the kids?

18:20.054 --> 18:22.021
- Oh, my God. My God.
- Okay.

18:22.056 --> 18:24.290
- Okay, oh, my God. Okay.
- Okay.

18:24.325 --> 18:25.358
- Don't move.
- No, no.

18:25.924 --> 18:27.026
- David?
- Yeah.

18:27.061 --> 18:28.661
Our last conversation on Earth

18:28.696 --> 18:30.130
- c-can't be an argument, okay?
- Uh-huh.

18:30.164 --> 18:32.832
Look, I'm really...
I'm really sorry that you gave up

18:32.867 --> 18:34.968
your dreams for me and that you...
you had to take

18:35.002 --> 18:37.303
some boring, stupid job because of me.

18:37.338 --> 18:39.139
Sweetie, come on, let's get real.

18:39.173 --> 18:40.974
I took that job because there
was a dope benefits package.

18:41.008 --> 18:42.909
I mean, a 401(k) and dental?

18:42.943 --> 18:44.210
That is rock and roll to me, baby.

18:44.245 --> 18:45.812
I did not give up my dream job.

18:45.846 --> 18:49.716
I bet on life with you being more fun
than anything else, and it is.

18:49.750 --> 18:52.218
Aw, baby, that is so sweet.

18:52.253 --> 18:54.854
I would kiss you, but I really
wanna stay very, very still.

18:54.889 --> 18:57.157
I only said all that stuff
because it really

18:57.191 --> 18:59.392
hurt my feelings that
you think I'm so boring

18:59.426 --> 19:01.394
that you had to hire
a girl to flirt with me.

19:01.428 --> 19:02.729
No, no, no, no, no.

19:02.763 --> 19:04.397
David, I don't think you're boring.
I don't.

19:04.431 --> 19:06.599
I just got scared that we've
forgotten how to have fun

19:06.634 --> 19:08.201
just the two of us, okay?

19:08.235 --> 19:09.002
You know what?

19:09.036 --> 19:10.770
It is not our fault. It's the kids'.

19:10.804 --> 19:12.539
It's their fault.
They're the boring ones.

19:12.573 --> 19:13.873
- So boring.
- Yes.

19:13.908 --> 19:17.043
Let's make sure that we take the time
to do these kinds of things more often

19:17.077 --> 19:18.745
so we never have to do
this kind of thing ever again.

19:18.779 --> 19:20.713
Yes, that is a deal.

19:21.482 --> 19:23.049
All right, you heard the guy.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.752
Only way down is to pull the ripcord.

19:26.554 --> 19:27.620
Pull that ripcord, baby.

19:27.655 --> 19:29.255
I love you, baby.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.624
I'll see you in hell.

19:38.632 --> 19:40.934
<i>You guys, I just had
the most amazing weekend</i>

19:40.968 --> 19:42.602
I have had in, like, forever.

19:42.636 --> 19:44.437
I mean, that ride was so fun.

19:44.471 --> 19:45.438
I'd never do it again.

19:45.472 --> 19:46.973
How was your weekend?

19:47.007 --> 19:48.481
The worst.

19:48.516 --> 19:50.476
We spent the whole thing
taking care of Griff.

19:50.511 --> 19:51.711
It's thankless.

19:51.745 --> 19:53.980
He didn't want pizza for lunch
because he had it for breakfast,

19:54.014 --> 19:56.983
so I made him chicken nuggets,
which he didn't even touch.

19:57.017 --> 19:58.451
So guess who ended up eating them.

19:58.485 --> 19:59.619
Me.

19:59.653 --> 20:00.954
And all he wanted to do was watch

20:00.988 --> 20:02.989
the "Fast and Furious"
movies over and over.

20:03.023 --> 20:06.459
I cannot watch a car
Tokyo drift ever again.

20:08.329 --> 20:09.963
Guys...

20:10.286 --> 20:11.598
I've gotta go.

20:11.632 --> 20:12.799
- Coming.
- No.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.768
Not you... Norman. I want Norman.

20:15.803 --> 20:17.070
I went last time.

20:17.104 --> 20:18.471
Well, he's asking for you.

20:19.045 --> 20:20.907
Damn, your lives suck.

20:22.373 --> 20:24.410
I don't want this weekend to end.

20:24.445 --> 20:25.945
Okay, the weekend's about to end.

20:25.980 --> 20:27.580
Put your neck brace on.

20:27.615 --> 20:28.848
Your parents are coming up
the driveway with the kids.

20:28.882 --> 20:31.317
Ugh, fine.

20:31.352 --> 20:32.685
Oh, ow!

20:32.720 --> 20:34.120
- Oh!
- Ow!

20:34.154 --> 20:35.521
Real or fake? Real or fake?

20:35.556 --> 20:37.323
Ow. Very real.

20:37.358 --> 20:38.758
Oh.

20:39.216 --> 20:39.993
Oh, dear.

20:40.027 --> 20:41.361
Have you been there this whole time?

20:41.395 --> 20:45.098
- Uh...
- No, no, I just... fell again.

20:45.132 --> 20:47.934
Yeah, we were re-creating
what happened the other day, and...

20:47.968 --> 20:49.602
Oh, save it, liars.

20:49.637 --> 20:51.004
Look what I found on the floor.

20:51.038 --> 20:54.474
You tricked us into taking the kids
for the weekend, didn't you?

20:54.508 --> 20:56.009
The picture.

20:56.043 --> 20:58.378
Yeah, all right, we did.

20:58.412 --> 21:00.213
- Ready?
- Yup. Aah!

21:01.282 --> 21:03.149
Look, kids,
please don't take it personally, okay?

21:03.183 --> 21:07.153
Mommy just needed
a little time to dance.

21:07.187 --> 21:09.555
I get it, Mom. We danced too.

21:09.590 --> 21:10.990
And we made some new friends.

21:11.025 --> 21:13.159
Can we please have them
over for a playdate?

21:13.193 --> 21:15.128
Yeah, sure,
we'll call their parents and set it up.

21:15.162 --> 21:16.362
Oh, their parents are dead.

21:16.397 --> 21:17.497
They died in the war.

21:18.732 --> 21:19.799
What?
