00:07.425 --> 00:12.972
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.097 --> 00:17.185
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:22.398
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:28.696
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.614 --> 00:34.535
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.334 --> 00:45.296
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

01:14.116 --> 01:15.785
People of Kattegat,

01:16.327 --> 01:18.454
we have a great sacrifice.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.999
This is Lagertha.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.549
No.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.096
That's not Lagertha.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.889
That's not Lagertha!

01:37.431 --> 01:38.974
Hail Lagertha!

01:39.058 --> 01:41.310
Hail Lagertha!

01:41.394 --> 01:42.770
Take her away.

01:43.646 --> 01:44.939
Take them away!

01:45.022 --> 01:47.358
Hail Lagertha!

01:47.441 --> 01:49.944
Take them away!

01:56.283 --> 01:57.284
I know who you are.

01:59.537 --> 02:01.080
Why aren't you at the ceremony?

02:02.998 --> 02:08.754
All hail Ivar!

02:13.134 --> 02:16.303
Kill him! Hail Lagertha!

02:17.847 --> 02:22.268
This is the witch who murdered
my mother in cold blood.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.145
This is Lagertha.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.938
No.
Shut your mouth!

02:27.773 --> 02:29.400
A Danish king

02:29.483 --> 02:31.360
handed her over to us.

02:31.736 --> 02:34.155
She was trying to make
a deal with him

02:34.238 --> 02:38.325
to persuade him to join her
in attacking Kattegat.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.786
Traitor!
Traitor, yes.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.288
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

02:43.998 --> 02:47.376
She would do anything for power.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.254
Thank the gods

02:50.588 --> 02:53.507
her plans have all come to nothing.
NO. “O. “O.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.302
Her wild ways
and blind ambitions...

02:56.385 --> 02:58.137
No, I'm not Lagertha.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.307
I sacrifice her
in the name of Odin

03:01.390 --> 03:03.768
and in the name
of five fellow gods.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.854
I sacrifice her
to cleanse this kingdom

03:07.313 --> 03:09.398
of its evil spirits!

03:39.053 --> 03:43.140
- Is she dead?
- Burn the witch!

04:21.428 --> 04:26.016
Here is the blood of the
witch who murdered our mother.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.397
You know very well
that wasn't Lagertha.

04:34.567 --> 04:37.444
You will drink
to Lagertha's death.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.196
She's not dead.

04:39.697 --> 04:41.115
And you're not a god.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.537
Of course, he is a god.

04:48.247 --> 04:52.418
How dare you say
that I'm not a god. Huh?

04:55.129 --> 04:58.716
Can't you hear Thor beating
his mighty hammer

04:58.799 --> 05:01.677
welcoming me into
the Hall of the Aesir.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.476
- Skol.
- Skol!

05:23.324 --> 05:26.452
<i>My brother, War the god.</i>

05:38.297 --> 05:39.381
<i>Why do you stay here?</i>

05:40.382 --> 05:41.383
Why not leave?

05:42.635 --> 05:44.219
Let's go away together.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.555
Don't you want to?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.599
I want to leave, but I can't.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.184
The gods won't let me.

05:51.310 --> 05:53.062
For some reason,
I have to stay here.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.023
I love my brother, Ubbe.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.567
But one day I abandoned him.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.487
I jumped ship and joined Ivar.

06:04.323 --> 06:07.701
I still don't know why,
but one day I will.

06:09.954 --> 06:12.873
One day I will understand.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.837
Thorunn!

06:26.553 --> 06:27.888
I can't find her.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.558
I can't find my wife.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.980
- Tell me where is she?
- No. stop.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.314
What have you done with her?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.149
I haven't done
anything with her.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.486
I don't know what happened to your wife.
Believe me.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.571
You're lying.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.991
You've killed her.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.952
She's carrying my grandchild.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.956
I want her to be alive.
I want to meet my grandchild.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.876
Where is she?

06:58.836 --> 07:00.587
You have to tell me.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.550
Helgi. Helgi! We don't know,
we've been looking.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.843
Someone knows.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.430
It's impossible
to survive out here.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.932
Nobody chooses to walk away.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.105
Tell us the truth.

07:19.732 --> 07:22.693
If you killed Thorunn you need
to tell us where the body is.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.071
I tell you again.

07:28.032 --> 07:29.867
I don't know
what's happened to her.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.661
I do.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.418
She came to me
to speak privately.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.216
She said that she was unhappy,

07:48.260 --> 07:52.389
that she did not want
to bring a child

07:52.973 --> 07:55.392
into this terrible world.

07:57.895 --> 08:01.523
And that she would make sure
that it did not happen.

08:02.858 --> 08:03.942
She wouldn't.

08:04.026 --> 08:07.279
It's not true.
It's not true.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.081
She would never have.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.256
Hello, Thorunn.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.175
Where have you been?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.261
At the waterfall.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.140
I had a message from Aud.
She wanted to see me.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.393
Was Aud there?

09:23.105 --> 09:24.356
Was someone else there?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.486
Who was it?

09:30.696 --> 09:32.906
Who was waiting for you
at the waterfall?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.200
Asbjorn.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.703
Helgi's brother?

09:38.662 --> 09:40.164
He told me I was evil.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.124
That I had
bewitched his brother.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.585
And that my child
was an evil spirit

09:44.668 --> 09:46.503
that could not be allowed
onto the Earth.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.840
And what did you say?

09:50.340 --> 09:51.800
I told him he was wrong.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.511
That I loved Helgi.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.513
That we loved one another.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.682
And that our child was innocent.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.936
And then what did he do?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.940
He picked up a sharp stone
that was ready beside him.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.818
And he struck my head
with the stone.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.406
80 hard that it split my head
and I fell.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.575
And I knew that I was dead.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.746
He had already prepared
a place for me.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.623
And had made a shallow trench.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.793
He laid me in the shallow trench
and covered my body with stones.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.720
Would you tell me
where this trench is?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.363
What else
have you heard of Wessex?

11:37.322 --> 11:38.949
Some interesting rumors.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.118
Such as?

11:42.536 --> 11:45.914
Well, I was told
out of the blue,

11:46.623 --> 11:50.502
the shield maiden Lagertha,
and two sons of Ragnar,

11:51.128 --> 11:53.463
Bjorn Ironside and Ubbe,

11:53.755 --> 11:56.383
appeared and sought refuge
at the king's villa.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.469
I don't know
whether or not to believe it.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.180
Oh, I can believe it.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.057
We were hunting them.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.226
They escaped.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.898
They had every reason to
come here, ancient reasons.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.609
But it's good. So good.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.695
Why good?

12:17.195 --> 12:19.614
I have some unfinished
business with Lagertha.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.076
She killed my wife.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.206
Do you really know,

12:28.457 --> 12:30.751
Jarl Olavsonn, how it is
to love a woman?

12:36.131 --> 12:37.132
I think so.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.134
Then you don't know.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.345
It's nothing to do with thinking and
it's nothing to do with the heart.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.307
It's in the gut,
it's in the entrails.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.519
Now, the trouble is

12:49.978 --> 12:53.398
the gods seem to have decided that
I should never be happily married.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.693
One day you will be,
King Harald.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.490
And how would you know?

13:02.866 --> 13:06.119
I feel it in my gut
and my entrails.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.770
I have some news.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.899
A large Viking army
is sailing into Wessex.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.443
From reports, I've heard
that the leader of the army

13:38.527 --> 13:41.071
is King Harald Finehair,
who, as you well know,

13:41.571 --> 13:43.240
has visited us before.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.035
I agreed to give you refuge here

13:47.452 --> 13:50.997
so long as in return you agree to
fight against your oountrymen.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.084
Now the time has come.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.797
You will work with my brother,
Prince Aethelred and Bishop Heahmund

13:58.880 --> 14:01.550
to devise a strategy
to defeat Finehair's army.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.678
If you refuse,
you will be killed.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.643
There'll be no future here,

14:11.726 --> 14:14.354
no grant of land, nothing.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.198
You must understand.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.825
And I think you do understand

14:26.908 --> 14:29.786
that I've taken a huge
personal risk to protect you.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.166
So, I pray that none of you
will betray me now.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.917
No one will betray you,

14:36.668 --> 14:38.670
and I'll fight with you
against King Harald.

14:55.937 --> 14:56.938
What?

14:58.481 --> 14:59.816
You cut your hair.

15:06.865 --> 15:07.949
Ubbe.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.165
I wanted to thank you,

15:17.500 --> 15:19.085
and to ask you a favor.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.474
First lesson

15:33.391 --> 15:34.768
is not to be afraid.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.645
So, go and stand by the tree.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.360
Why? What are you
going to do?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.279
You asked me
to teach you how to fight.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.534
And I can teach you the ways in which to
fight with a sword and axe or a shield

15:51.993 --> 15:53.245
to stay alive.

15:53.828 --> 15:54.996
But if you're afraid,

15:55.455 --> 15:56.998
then you're already dead.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.377
So, go and stand by the tree.

16:11.012 --> 16:14.266
<i>Ewwm, ZIZ.mw
720 WXIPKWM Ommfl CD</i>

16:19.354 --> 16:20.563
Ubbe.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.357
Do not be afraid.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.288
Hmm.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.646
The ground here
has been disturbed.

17:14.743 --> 17:15.744
Thorunn.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.547
How did you know?

17:28.673 --> 17:31.843
Floki, how did you know
she was here?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.681
She told me.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.853
Did she also tell you
who killed her?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.943
You must admit your guilt.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.242
I don't admit anything.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.370
There's no proof.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.830
I know who killed her.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.462
Stop it!

18:08.671 --> 18:09.881
Stop it!

18:10.632 --> 18:12.550
How can you quarrel and fight

18:12.801 --> 18:16.429
when she is not properly
prepared for the gods?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.476
Oh, you're natural parents.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.355
You're natural brothers
and sisters.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.567
How can you behave this way?

18:33.822 --> 18:35.198
We can't go on.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.618
We have to make a decision.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.835
How did you survive?

18:47.377 --> 18:49.003
My anger kept me alive.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.382
After Aethelwulf
expelled me from the villa,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.801
I had nothing left but anger.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.263
I said to myself,
if there was any way

18:58.346 --> 19:00.974
that I could gain my revenge
on them in the future,

19:01.975 --> 19:05.437
then my life will after all
have been worth living.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.067
And for a Viking
revenge is everything.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.237
Isn't it true?

19:15.447 --> 19:19.075
Well, I'm Viking.
Just like you.

19:19.534 --> 19:21.202
My father was Ragnar Lothbrok,

19:21.286 --> 19:23.163
the most famous of all Vikings.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.833
That's all I care about.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.420
What do you think
about King Alfred?

19:32.422 --> 19:33.465
I hate him.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.844
We're going to fight
on his behalf.

19:40.722 --> 19:41.973
You don't have to.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.103
Ihear Harald Finehair is on his
way here with a great army.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.786
What?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.583
Oh, it's you.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.794
I do not want
to disturb you, husband.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.757
No, no. Of course,
I was just preoccupied.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.383
I'm sorry.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.804
Perhaps not such a good husband.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.973
I've nothing to complain about.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.602
Forgive me, Ethelfled. I've
some business to attend to.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.190
When I return,

20:33.566 --> 20:37.278
I shall perform
the duties of a husband.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.871
Prince.

20:47.622 --> 20:48.998
My Lord Cyneheard.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.459
A Viking army approaches.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.504
We feel the time
to act has come.

20:55.713 --> 20:56.714
Are you sure?

20:56.965 --> 20:58.216
Never more so.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.011
Your brother should
never have been made king.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.391
The decision has placed
our whole realm in jeopardy.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.060
He's a weak and feeble leader.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.104
In a time of war,

21:12.063 --> 21:14.774
he entrusts a group of pagans
with our defense.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.277
He places his faith
in Bishop Heahmund,

21:17.527 --> 21:19.279
a faithless man.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.827
Prince, we must seize the time.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.205
If we are too afraid to act,
then shall Wessex perish

21:29.289 --> 21:31.916
like every other
English kingdom led by

21:32.000 --> 21:33.793
feeble-minded rulers.

21:36.379 --> 21:41.551
But you, the son
and true heir of Aethelwulf,

21:42.051 --> 21:44.387
we believe
we can place all our trust

21:44.470 --> 21:46.180
and all our faith in you.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.350
And what is your plan, my Lord?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.729
We will call a meeting
of the war council.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.733
The king must attend, but
so too must Bishop Heahmund

21:56.816 --> 22:00.862
and his pagan friends.
That is the time to strike.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.365
We have enough warriors
committed to our cause

22:04.449 --> 22:06.743
to shut the doors
and kill them all.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.082
And then,
as it always should've been,

22:14.584 --> 22:16.836
you will be anointed and crowned

22:18.254 --> 22:19.964
King of Wessex,

22:21.507 --> 22:23.134
King of Kings.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.970
What do you say?

22:30.516 --> 22:31.726
I agree.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.103
Call the council.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.567
I should call him Balder,

22:40.652 --> 22:42.570
after Odin's beautiful son,

22:43.529 --> 22:45.948
the fairest and wisest
of all the gods.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.162
The shining one.

22:53.081 --> 22:56.125
I believe he's so strong
he's already moving.

22:57.752 --> 23:01.964
Perhaps one night he will just
crawl out from between my legs,

23:02.090 --> 23:03.675
fully formed.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.177
In that case,

23:06.886 --> 23:09.389
I'd like for him to be
walking out, not crawling.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.393
<i>MAN“. My Lord Nat.</i>

23:18.940 --> 23:20.858
<i>My Lord Nat.
What?</i>

23:21.109 --> 23:23.319
We caught them. They've
been trying for a while

23:23.403 --> 23:25.196
to raise a rebellion in the town

23:25.905 --> 23:27.407
against your rule.

23:28.783 --> 23:29.951
Uh-huh.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.206
You...

23:37.500 --> 23:39.544
You.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.923
Is it true you want
to rebel against me?

23:46.551 --> 23:47.552
Why?

23:48.136 --> 23:51.597
I'm no ordinary man.
I'm no ordinary ruler.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.642
I expect you to rejoice.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.894
For you are
especially privileged.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.022
For you are ruled by a god.

24:06.487 --> 24:07.905
Help him to his feet.

24:14.036 --> 24:18.875
I'll tell you what.
I'm a merciful god.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.127
I love my people.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.464
So, if you go into
the market place

24:24.547 --> 24:26.007
and cover yourself with ashes,

24:26.090 --> 24:28.843
admitting you're false
and your false beliefs,

24:30.344 --> 24:32.305
then beg my forgiveness,

24:33.973 --> 24:35.641
then I will let you live.

24:37.727 --> 24:38.770
Huh?

24:39.937 --> 24:41.731
What do you say? Hmm?

24:57.455 --> 24:58.623
Hang them.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.542
And let their bodies be shown
to the people as a warning.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.926
Hatred must never
take the place of love.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.901
Son of Ragnar,

25:27.652 --> 25:29.695
why have you sought me out?

25:29.821 --> 25:31.948
I need you to help me.

25:32.323 --> 25:36.160
You've seen the past,
the present and the future.

25:37.537 --> 25:41.332
What do you want to know
that you do not know already?

25:41.415 --> 25:47.088
I have rarely come to see you.
I've tried all my life

25:47.839 --> 25:51.092
not to live by prophecy
but through experience.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.803
Poor you.

25:54.971 --> 25:59.600
It seems to me that we learn
so little from experience.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.603
Still you are wise.

26:02.979 --> 26:05.815
No, I'm an old man.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.609
And old men are not wise.

26:09.694 --> 26:13.114
They still wish
that they were young.

26:13.739 --> 26:18.119
And they rage
against their frailties

26:18.786 --> 26:21.914
and their fading memories.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.708
What am I here for?

26:25.209 --> 26:30.339
You'll accomplish what others before
you have failed to accomplish.

26:30.673 --> 26:33.551
But the cost will be too high.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.514
If I sailed away now,
would it be different?

26:38.723 --> 26:40.224
You can try.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.976
What will I accomplish?

26:42.560 --> 26:46.480
If you chose to sail away,
perhaps nothing.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.066
You're not helping me.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.569
What did you expect?

26:52.612 --> 26:55.656
Everything is becoming darker.

26:56.991 --> 27:01.078
We're all going into the dark.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.540
I'm afraid.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.043
I know that what I do not know

27:07.126 --> 27:09.921
is the only thing
that I really know.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.007
And I'm afraid.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.929
I'm afraid
of going into the dark.

27:51.712 --> 27:52.880
Are you here?

28:09.939 --> 28:11.023
My love.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.199
So, we're going
to fight King Harald?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.201
And your own kind?

28:23.327 --> 28:24.412
How do you feel?

28:26.622 --> 28:29.375
King Harald has always
been my enemy.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.212
I thank the Lord god

28:33.754 --> 28:35.381
that you're here beside me.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.633
That we may live

28:37.717 --> 28:39.093
or die together.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.555
Miserable sinner that I am.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.312
Are you sure?

28:52.898 --> 28:56.026
Are you not afraid
that for this love,

28:56.110 --> 28:57.820
your god will forsake you?

28:58.612 --> 28:59.613
Yes.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.158
I fear the Lord.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.121
But now, in this moment,

29:08.581 --> 29:10.583
I desire you more.

29:12.668 --> 29:17.923
You are so beautiful, so alive,

29:21.093 --> 29:24.305
I would go to hell
for you, Lagertha.

29:41.655 --> 29:42.865
What could we expect?

29:43.073 --> 29:44.575
They will already
know we're here

29:44.658 --> 29:47.036
and they will possibly
try to block the river.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.413
What is our greatest danger?

29:50.289 --> 29:53.584
When our warriors see that they're
going to fight against Lagertha,

29:53.751 --> 29:56.796
Bjorn Ironside and Ubbe,
sons of Ragnar,

29:57.505 --> 30:00.841
ask yourself how'd you feel if
you saw them rage against you.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.887
These are legendary heroes.
They're not human.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.223
They're almost gods.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.557
And whatever they say,

30:09.308 --> 30:13.562
our warriors will be intimidated
to face them, and why not?

30:14.271 --> 30:15.481
Why not?

30:15.731 --> 30:17.650
They are, after all, only human.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.611
The axe would kill them too.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.414
Do you think fate has
brought us together?

30:34.542 --> 30:35.584
Us?

30:36.335 --> 30:37.503
You and I.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.589
I couldn't say.

30:42.383 --> 30:45.302
On the contrary, that is
exactly what you did say.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.306
I don't want to make a decision.

30:49.932 --> 30:52.768
I don't want to betray anyone.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.313
I just want to find out what the
fates have in store for me.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.358
Somehow it feels right
to be here.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.362
Feels inevitable.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.284
I know my life
is about to change.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.240
I've decided
to lead the army myself.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.827
I hope you agree.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.164
It means I will require
your support more than ever.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.000
Of course.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.713
I believe in you.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.716
And I hope you believe in me.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.143
I love you, brother.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.651
And I you.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.595
My Lords,

32:51.845 --> 32:55.933
we're only days away from the greatest
challenge our kingdom has faced.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.353
We must all act together.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.647
We need one another.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.024
It is no weakness to say so.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.029
I've decided
to lead you into battle.

33:10.114 --> 33:13.867
But I know that I have the support
of my beloved brother, Aethelred.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.496
And of Ubbe,
the Christian son of Ragnar,

33:17.579 --> 33:20.165
and of Lagertha, and of Bjorn.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.628
We must not be afraid ofourdeanngs
with these foreigners,

33:26.130 --> 33:27.214
these Vikings.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.133
The signal.
Give that signal...

33:29.550 --> 33:31.844
They are our allies
and our future.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.432
I can't.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.102
Then we are lost.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.203
I want you all
to meet someone special.

33:59.329 --> 34:00.497
This is Magnus.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.418
I recognize that name.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.838
We were told that Ragnar
had fathered a son in Wessex.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.632
And here he is,
our half-brother.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.969
The son of Ragnar
and Queen Kwenthrith.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.476
Hello, Magnus.

34:20.809 --> 34:21.810
You must be Lagertha.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.605
What a great privilege
it is to meet you at last.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.690
And you must be Ubbe.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.527
In all the years
I've had to hide my identity,

34:30.652 --> 34:32.362
I've heard stories
of Bjorn Ironside

34:32.446 --> 34:34.156
and Queen Lagertha and Ubbe.

34:36.950 --> 34:38.619
At last, I have my family.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.247
And at last I belong somewhere.

34:43.624 --> 34:47.795
Magnus believes that Alfred and
his family have betrayed him.

34:49.171 --> 34:50.422
And have betrayed us.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.886
That they had no intention of
granting us the lands in East Anglia.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.140
And they have no intention now.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.107
Did you ever meet Ragnar?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.943
When he was imprisoned here,
I met him.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.657
We embraced and wept.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.325
And he told me

35:18.826 --> 35:21.578
that he loved me as much
as all of his other sons.

35:23.747 --> 35:24.832
Oh.

35:31.255 --> 35:34.383
He told my mother that he never
had sex with Queen Kwenthrith.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.096
He would. Wouldn't he?

35:42.266 --> 35:44.309
What is it that
you want from us, Magnus?

35:47.938 --> 35:48.981
Hmm.

35:52.943 --> 35:55.779
Harald Finehair is coming here
with a great army.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.575
You should join him and destroy
the kingdom of Wessex.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.785
Destroying kingdoms, huh?

36:01.910 --> 36:03.287
Suddenly you're so important.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.830
I've waited a lifetime.

36:06.582 --> 36:09.001
This is the meaning of my life.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.007
Ragnar also told me

36:15.090 --> 36:17.759
that he never had sex
with Queen Kwenthrith.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.470
That he was wounded

36:20.888 --> 36:22.723
and she pissed on his wound.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.391
And that was all.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.893
Of course he told you that.

36:26.935 --> 36:27.978
He was lying.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.441
I don't understand why
you're all behaving like this.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.610
I think we should take
Magnus's story seriously.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.987
I believe he's telling the truth.
I think he's lying.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.447
Ubbe.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.075
No, I do not believe
that he's my father's son.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.871
I do not believe that we should
betray Alfred on his word.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.891
That's because
Alfred has corrupted you.

36:47.915 --> 36:48.916
No.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.043
Now you call yourself
a Christian.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.130
So, you are even less of a
brother to me than Magnus is.

36:55.214 --> 36:56.840
You know,
we should stop arguing.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.344
I don't want to argue.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.221
You don't believe me.

37:03.639 --> 37:04.723
I can see it.

37:10.604 --> 37:11.855
I'm sorry.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.024
I just don't believe your story.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.407
I don't believe him.
But I do.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.495
We have choices to make.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.589
I have made a decision.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.051
Your decisions
are worthless, Floki.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.971
You're not king of this island.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.098
And I am lawgiver.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.642
I said I would
make you lawgiver, yes.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.895
If you didn't avenge your son.

37:52.854 --> 37:54.022
But you did.

37:55.065 --> 37:59.111
And now, with the deaths of
Thorunn and her unborn Child,

37:59.194 --> 38:01.780
you've avenged him
three times over.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.827
You like the sound of your own words.
Don't you, Floki'?

38:07.411 --> 38:09.746
But they always
sound hollow to me.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.543
We always believed in Floki.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.337
It's why we came.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.425
Rafarta, you and your family

38:21.508 --> 38:24.469
have undermined and destroyed
all of our hopes.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.556
You've destroyed
my life, Father.

38:28.682 --> 38:30.142
Shut up, Helgi!

38:31.018 --> 38:32.769
We hear too much from you.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.522
And you're always
weeping like a woman.

38:35.856 --> 38:37.816
I have reason to weep.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.694
And if you come
any closer to me,

38:40.777 --> 38:43.071
your mother and father
will have reason to weep also.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.490
Floki is right.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.285
He has come to a decision.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.996
We must all respect it.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.331
There is no other way.

38:56.460 --> 39:00.130
Eyvind and his entire family,

39:01.173 --> 39:02.799
including you, Helgi,

39:03.967 --> 39:06.011
are expelled
from this settlement.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.765
You must leave.

39:10.891 --> 39:12.225
And find another place.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.102
Far away from here.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.189
You can't expel us, Floki.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.648
Winter is here.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.734
Food is scarce,
we won't survive.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.611
That lies in your hands.

39:26.740 --> 39:27.991
We could fight.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.371
You could.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.583
But you would lose.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.387
So, is this the result, Floki?

39:51.223 --> 39:55.769
Is this the result of your great
dreams, your precious idealism?

39:57.187 --> 39:58.271
This?

39:58.563 --> 40:00.232
I just want you to leave.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.659
You can't kill me, Eyvind.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.246
No matter how hard you try.

41:29.404 --> 41:34.034
These are days for rejoicing,
ancient one. You know that.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.995
Wonderful things
have come to pass.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.247
I know what I know.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.667
You cannot deny my divinity.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.170
You've known about it all along.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.507
The Allfather's blood
runs in my veins.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.553
The Aesir have welcomed me
into their Halls.

42:03.772 --> 42:06.650
You will tell
all who ask of this good news.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.987
I tell only what I see.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.200
That's all I ask, wise one.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.494
Tell them the truth.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.831
You're Ivar, the Boneless,
son of Ragnar.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.752
I'm the god Ivar.

42:28.672 --> 42:31.007
All things are dark.

42:31.341 --> 42:36.596
We shall all,
all of us go into the dark.

42:37.514 --> 42:42.060
Your chariot lies
as broken as your legs.

42:43.103 --> 42:47.357
A snake has settled
in your skull.

42:47.983 --> 42:50.777
And your eyes betray you.

42:51.194 --> 42:57.117
Your path is strewn
with garbage and filth.

42:57.951 --> 43:00.412
Oh, the horror.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.706
The horror...

43:04.207 --> 43:06.209
No!
