00:04.210 --> 00:06.670
I'm sorry, Barbara.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.500
You deserve the whole story.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.670
Jon, you say everything
happens for a reason.

00:10.670 --> 00:11.920
I can't find a reason for this.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.330
Jon:
You deserve the truth.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.920
That was beautiful.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.040
You once told me that
we can't change the past.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.750
We can only change
our reaction to it.

00:20.750 --> 00:24.040
Because even if the past
is painful,

00:24.040 --> 00:28.040
you never know when it'll lead
to something wonderful.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.420
But, Barbara, after what
happened all those years ago,

00:32.420 --> 00:34.040
I think I get it now.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.460
So if I were to ask myself today

00:36.460 --> 00:38.920
if I'd change the past
or my reaction to it...

00:38.920 --> 00:41.120
Somebody!

00:41.120 --> 00:43.080
...honestly,

00:43.080 --> 00:45.790
...I'd say both.

No, but even if
that were the case,

gonna leave this one here

03:13.750 --> 03:15.710
Oh, come on, D.
That's dangerous.

03:15.710 --> 03:19.040

03:22.040 --> 03:23.880
We're still on
for tonight?

03:25.750 --> 03:28.540
I made

It's 6:00 p.m.
I told you about it on...
Yeah.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.710
...on Monday.
Monday, we spoke, yeah.

03:32.710 --> 03:35.080
Um...yeah.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.080
I'm good for that.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.920
I'm looking forward
to it.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.880
Jon, I told you.
We -- We really need to talk.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.620
Yeah.
Couldn't agree more.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.210
L'epine. 6:00.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.420
He promised
he'd be there.

04:09.420 --> 04:12.290
We're really
doing this, huh?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.420
I'll see you soon.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.420
I love you.
Love you, too.

04:23.750 --> 04:24.920
You either love it,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.920
or you really love it.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.250
-What?
-Or you --

04:28.250 --> 04:30.460
What? No. That --
That's my, um, copy

04:30.460 --> 04:32.460
for my pitch.
It's today.

04:32.460 --> 04:33.880
Oh.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.460
I thought you were
actually talking to me

04:35.460 --> 04:37.040
instead of
working on the pitch.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.830
Well, this is more
than just a commercial, okay?

04:38.830 --> 04:41.210
This is a Super Bowl
commercial,

04:41.210 --> 04:43.040
and it's --
it's the high-water mark

04:43.040 --> 04:45.620
of everything I've ever
tried to do in my career.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.040
I have to get this job.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.670
The truth is,
I'm just jealous.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.880
I mean,
you're living the dream,

04:51.880 --> 04:54.790
and I'm off to feed the elite
of Boston big pharma.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.960
What is it about sales reps?
They can't get enough

04:56.960 --> 04:58.330
clam chowder
in a shot glass?

04:58.330 --> 04:59.880
Why don't you pitch

04:59.880 --> 05:01.620
one of your fusion dishes
to your boss?

05:01.620 --> 05:02.670
That, um,
grilled polenta

05:02.670 --> 05:04.880
with the little green onions --
Ramps.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.830
Delicious. You got to
enjoy your work, right?

05:06.830 --> 05:08.120
Right.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.120
But until then,
a job is a job.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.880
Good luck on your --
D-Don't jinx it.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.080
Don't -- Don't, please.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.500
Basketball game?

05:15.500 --> 05:16.830
Well, don't jinx
that either.

05:16.830 --> 05:19.040
Mwah!

05:19.040 --> 05:20.500
Why are you stalling?

05:20.500 --> 05:22.250
We -- We should
get to it.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.500
Dad, you did not have to
fly all the way here

05:25.500 --> 05:26.580
just to help me unpack.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.580
I was afraid
you'd started without me.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.000
Freshman year,
your curtains were up

05:31.000 --> 05:33.380
while I was still
parking the truck.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.000
Where is it?

05:38.670 --> 05:40.880
Are we really
doing this?

05:40.880 --> 05:43.330
You better believe it.
Okay. Bring it here.

05:43.330 --> 05:44.880
All right.
Careful.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.670
Sweet.

05:49.330 --> 05:52.250
There we are.

you love this song.

What?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.330
I don't know
what her problem is.

06:44.330 --> 06:48.330
Man. Ooh-hoo.
Phone charger, really?

06:48.330 --> 06:50.080
Dude, I thought
you liked this girl.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.250
It's not about
the phone charger.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.750
It's about what
the phone charger represents.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.670
A charged battery.

06:54.670 --> 06:58.120
So, it's Stacey with the trip
planned too far out --

06:58.120 --> 06:59.330
Stacey was
planning Christmas

06:59.330 --> 07:00.420
while I was still
wearing shorts.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.170
And Melanie with
the couple's massage --

07:02.170 --> 07:04.580
It says "couple's"
in the name.

07:04.580 --> 07:08.170
And now it's Kendra with
what the charger represents?

07:08.170 --> 07:10.000
Come on. I dated Kendra
for two weeks.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Your longest relationship ever.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.750
Hey, gentlemen.
What did I miss?

07:14.750 --> 07:17.750
Well, apparently,
I'm on trial for making

07:17.750 --> 07:19.330
a perfectly rational
dating decision.

07:19.330 --> 07:21.290
What happened to you?
How come you can't commit

07:21.290 --> 07:23.000
to something
for more than two weeks?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.210
Uh...

07:25.210 --> 07:28.000
Sorry, Jon. I haven't found
my soul mate like you did.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.960
I guess I could
start trolling Logan Airport,

07:29.960 --> 07:31.380
huh,
looking for the one.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.120
No, it's not about
a woman, Gary.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.540
It's about you.
Really?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.000
'Cause it kind of feels like
you're coming at me, dude,

07:37.000 --> 07:38.620
because
I'm not living up

07:38.620 --> 07:41.040
to your version
of my full potential.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.460
That would be creepy
if it wasn't insulting.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.380
Guys. Hey, I'm open.
Bring it.

07:46.290 --> 07:48.620
You're not even on his team.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.830
Sort of feels like every man
for himself right now.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.960
You're going
for a screening tomorrow.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.500
You think
I don't know that?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.330
You think that doesn't
completely consume my life

07:56.330 --> 07:58.880
every three months?
Get out of here, man.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.170
I didn't stay by your side
and Rutledge you through chemo

08:01.170 --> 08:02.830
so you could
piss your life away.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.420
Wow.
I didn't realize

08:04.420 --> 08:06.330
that when you sat with me
in the chemo bay,

08:06.330 --> 08:08.080
it was an IOU.
-Guys.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.040
You've been keeping a mental
scorecard this whole time

08:11.040 --> 08:12.580
that I'm unaware of?

08:12.580 --> 08:14.750
How much do I owe you
for Bruins tickets?
Eddie: Gary!

08:14.750 --> 08:17.040
You just spent the last year
and a half fighting cancer!

08:18.710 --> 08:22.330
What's the point of living
if you're not gonna live?

08:22.330 --> 08:23.540
-Hey. Come on.
-Okay. Easy. Easy.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.000
-Gentlemen, easy, easy, easy.
-Come on, Jon.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.540
Let's just all take a breath.
-Take a breather, man.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.920
No. You know what, Jon?
You go to hell.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.040
Unbelievable.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.420
Jon: You okay?

08:59.620 --> 09:01.120
What's going on?

09:01.120 --> 09:03.120
Uh, Delilah
got a ticket.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.380
Um, they sent it here

09:04.380 --> 09:06.210
'cause the car's registered
to the business.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.380
It's from
a red-light camera.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.040
Yeah, we --
we can't fight that.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.710
Go ahead. Pay it.
It's her, right?

09:11.710 --> 09:13.040
Yeah. It's just...

09:14.620 --> 09:15.880
Hi, Jeri.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.290
Yes,
I got your message.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.460
I am not taking no
for an answer on this one.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.880
I can't.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.080
Ashley,
give me a minute.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.460
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.420
I don't get it, man.
Why --

09:27.420 --> 09:29.420
Why would Jon
pick a fight with me?

09:29.420 --> 09:31.000
I-I don't know, dude.
It seemed like

09:31.000 --> 09:32.580
it got a little heated
on both sides.

09:32.580 --> 09:36.250
Hey. You hungry?
I mean, I could grab something

09:36.250 --> 09:37.170
with you
after this pitch.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.620
No. I'm talking
to this dog.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.080
He looks a little rough.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.420
Hey, listen, I got to go,
man. Sorry.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.960
Man, this dog
is following me.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.420
Yeah, probably 'cause,
unlike me,

09:46.420 --> 09:48.960
he's got nothing
better to do. Goodbye.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.580
Rome?
They're ready for you.

09:51.580 --> 09:52.580
Okay.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.250
And now you want to
hang out, huh?

09:58.250 --> 10:00.790
Ha!

10:03.460 --> 10:04.880
We could probably get in
a lot of trouble together,

10:04.880 --> 10:06.670
you and me, I bet.

10:06.670 --> 10:09.790
I'm guessing there's
no Mrs. Dog at home, right?

10:09.790 --> 10:11.460
No.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.330
Okay, bud.
Let's get you to a shelter.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.960
Rome: And the TSA Agent
tells her,

10:14.960 --> 10:16.380
you either
throw away the bottle

10:16.380 --> 10:18.210
and make the flight
to your best friend's wedding,

10:18.210 --> 10:21.460
or keep the ranch and lose
her maid of honor title.

10:22.790 --> 10:28.620
So Emily, well, she does
the one thing that she can.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.170
She tips the bottle back
and chugs it

10:35.170 --> 10:36.540
right there
in the security line.

10:38.330 --> 10:41.380
"Hidden Valley Ranch --

10:41.380 --> 10:44.960
You either love it
or you really love it."

10:48.210 --> 10:50.250
Wow, Rome.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.420
I think
I speak for us all

10:51.420 --> 10:53.080
when I say
we are blown away.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.880
Thank y'all.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.420
This could be big,
a game changer.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.080
Are you ready
for that?

10:59.080 --> 11:03.330
I've been waiting for this
my entire life.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.540
Are we sure we need it?
We got to get to Grandma's.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.380
I got to get my T-Rex.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.330
I promised Grandma
I'd show it to her tonight.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.040
Without it,
my diorama's just a box.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.670
Can we go
to the museum next week?

11:17.670 --> 11:19.670
There's an exhibit
on the Cretaceous period.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.250
Absolutely.
Let's go Wednesday.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.670
You get out early.
But I want Mom to go.

11:23.670 --> 11:26.250
She thinks the dinosaurs
went extinct from a plague,

11:26.250 --> 11:27.830
but I think
it was a comet.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.040
I just want to see
who's right.

11:31.710 --> 11:34.620
Hey. Did something happen
with you and a guest?

11:34.620 --> 11:37.420
Actually, yes.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.250
These are big clients,
Regina.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.540
You can't make a scene
like that.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.880
That guy
grabbed my ass, Cal.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
Look, I didn't see
what happened.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.920
All I saw
was the aftermath.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.380
But I'm telling you
what happened.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.380
I understand you're upset,
but bottom line,

11:51.380 --> 11:52.750
we can't afford
to lose this account.

11:52.750 --> 11:56.710
Even if it means giving up the
safety of your own employees?

11:56.710 --> 11:59.250
Gina, please
don't be like that.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.540
Come on, Jeri!

12:09.540 --> 12:11.750
You said
you had the votes!

12:11.750 --> 12:13.790
Damn it!

12:13.790 --> 12:15.170
What happened?

12:15.170 --> 12:17.080
Close the door.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.620
They're not gonna take up
the subway vote this session.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.250
It's gonna die
in committee.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.830
It's over.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.460
That's okay.
That's okay.

12:33.460 --> 12:36.460
We can leverage
the Franklin project.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.250
Or we can liquidate
the Somerville properties,

12:38.250 --> 12:39.750
and that'll buy us
at least a couple of weeks.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.420
I sold off Somerville last month
to pay for October,

12:42.420 --> 12:45.250
along with
Franklin and Court Street.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.620
Wait, but I didn't see
any of those documents.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.080
We're over-leveraged
already.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.420
There's nothing
left to sell.

12:49.420 --> 12:53.460
That subway vote was the only
thing keeping us afloat.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.290
Look, I'll -- I'll just
call the lenders.

12:55.290 --> 12:56.290
I'll ask them
for another extension.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.790
They gave us at least --
No. Ashley.

12:58.790 --> 13:00.620
It's over.

13:06.120 --> 13:09.830
You know what?
Go finish up.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.620
We're taking
the night off.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.620
W-Why?

13:13.620 --> 13:16.710
I want to show you
something.

13:16.710 --> 13:20.290
All right. On it.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.500
Jon.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.250
What are we
doing here?

14:08.250 --> 14:11.580
I'm not the man
everyone thinks I am.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.290
No, wait a second.
I can-- I can't, uh...

14:33.290 --> 14:34.460
-Oh, my God.
-No, that's not --

14:34.460 --> 14:35.710
No, yeah, I --
That's not why I brought you.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.040
I'm so sorry. I should go.
No, really, Ash,

14:37.040 --> 14:38.790
it's ok--
it's my fault.

14:38.790 --> 14:42.960
It was my fault.
I-I should have been more clear.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.040
I'm so sorry.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.040
Listen.
You're remarkable.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.210
Any man would be lucky
to have you in his life,

14:50.210 --> 14:52.210
and I'm lucky
to have you in mine.

14:52.210 --> 14:55.750
Okay,
but i-it can't be...

14:55.750 --> 14:58.120
Yeah.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.790
I just wanted to
show you this place.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.290
I've never brought anyone
here before.

15:03.290 --> 15:05.920
It's, uh...

15:08.920 --> 15:10.960
It's very special to me.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.920
Yeah.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.750
Good evening.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.000
You sure I can't get you
started with a glass of wine?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.420
We have a wonderful
Chenin Blanc.

15:34.420 --> 15:36.420
It's new to the wine list.
Thank you,

15:36.420 --> 15:38.330
but I think I'm still
waiting for -- for my husband.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.880
He should be here any --
any minute now.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.670
It's gonna take me
at least four minutes

15:42.670 --> 15:44.290
to get that glass
over here.

15:44.290 --> 15:47.120
So by then, maybe he'll be here
and you won't be drinking alone.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.460
Or, if he's not here,
maybe you'll want to be.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.290
Well, you make
a very good point.

15:52.290 --> 15:55.830
Okay.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.830
Oh, my God.
So that's from
Freshman Orientation.

15:57.830 --> 15:58.960
Oh, yeah, it is.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.040
Mm-hmm.
Wow.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.380
Okay, in my defense,

16:02.380 --> 16:04.120
the mullet was all the rage
back in the '80s.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.960
Oh, was it?

16:09.290 --> 16:11.460
Jon.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.290
Yeah.

16:14.290 --> 16:15.880
Yeah. Look,
when I was your age,

16:15.880 --> 16:17.330
I, uh --
I used to live here.

16:17.330 --> 16:20.540
In this apartment?
Mm-hmm.

16:20.540 --> 16:25.170
Yep. Some of the best times
in my life happened here.

16:25.170 --> 16:27.000
It's why I bought
the place.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.170
Hold on.
All this time,

16:30.170 --> 16:32.330
I thought you overpaid
for this block

16:32.330 --> 16:36.170
because of the subway,
but it was for this.

16:36.170 --> 16:39.830
You bought this entire block
to save this apartment.

16:39.830 --> 16:42.830
Well, I didn't like the thought
of it being bulldozed

16:42.830 --> 16:46.210
to make way for
another shopping mall.

16:46.210 --> 16:49.580
But I suppose
it's a matter of time now.

16:53.830 --> 16:56.670
I wanted you
to see it.

16:56.670 --> 16:59.710
I wanted you to see what
we were working so hard for...

16:59.710 --> 17:01.960
Before
it was too late.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.960
Something like that.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.460
Oh.

17:10.540 --> 17:11.750
Who's that?

17:21.420 --> 17:24.580
Enough of my mullet days.

17:24.580 --> 17:25.880
Let's talk about you.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.920
Dad, I think it's time
to flip the pancakes.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
I know that you don't trust
my bubble judgment.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.540
But believe me
when I say

17:35.540 --> 17:38.540
that we do not have enough flour
for another batch, okay?

17:43.540 --> 17:45.170
Dad?

17:49.170 --> 17:50.420
You still have it.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.120
Yeah, I still think about

18:04.120 --> 18:05.920
that day at the carnival
all the time.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.920
You do?

18:07.920 --> 18:13.790
You know, he didn't
actually win it for me.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.580
Those milk cans
weren't falling down.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.460
Chad saw me crying,

18:20.460 --> 18:22.420
and he marched me
back over to that booth,

18:22.420 --> 18:25.250
because he knew
the game was rigged.

18:25.250 --> 18:29.670
And he climbed
over the counter,

18:29.670 --> 18:31.210
and he stole it.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.000
I've never seen
somebody run away so fast.

18:38.210 --> 18:39.460
Ah.

18:39.460 --> 18:43.460
He made me promise
not to tell you or Mom.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.830
Well,
while we're fessing up,

18:45.830 --> 18:48.830
I paid that carny 50 bucks
to let you keep this bear.

18:48.830 --> 18:50.460
Wait. You --

18:50.460 --> 18:51.670
You knew
this entire time?

18:51.670 --> 18:52.830
Mm-hmm.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.040
Well, I guess
it was so nice to see

18:55.040 --> 18:57.210
you two had
a little secret.

18:57.210 --> 19:00.620
You may not remember this,
but...

19:00.620 --> 19:04.120
you used to fight like cats
and dogs when you were kids.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.960
There was something
about that night. Like...

19:06.960 --> 19:10.540
you finally realized
you were on the same team.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.830
I never told your mom.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.580
Why?
Well...

19:16.580 --> 19:19.920
she was happier
not knowing the truth.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.540
Does that make me
a bad person?

19:25.540 --> 19:27.750
No.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.000
It just makes you
someone who loves her.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.250
Don't be so hard
on your mom.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.500
We all cope
in different ways.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.670
I think in some ways,
I probably smother you.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.710
It's just...

19:48.880 --> 19:52.580
The idea
that I couldn't protect...

19:52.580 --> 19:54.580
my child...

19:54.580 --> 19:56.040
Hey, it's okay.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.540
I tried.

20:07.580 --> 20:11.380
If you could do
anything with your life,

20:11.380 --> 20:12.210
what would you do?

20:18.710 --> 20:22.460
I mean,
not to be cheesy, but...

20:22.460 --> 20:23.790
I'd like
to be you one day.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.080
King of Boston
real estate.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.120
Yeah, you --
you don't want to be me.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.120
Seriously, though,
you got to have some dream.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.580
What is it?

20:34.580 --> 20:36.000
I'd go to Barcelona.

20:37.790 --> 20:40.420
My grandparents
are from there.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.750
I've always wanted to see
the chapel they got married in.

20:43.750 --> 20:48.500
My, uh, parents tried
really hard to assimilate.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.080
And I just thought...

20:52.080 --> 20:54.500
I can't even
speak Spanish.

20:56.290 --> 20:57.750
It's one of
my biggest regrets.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.080
So go.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.580
Yeah.
Well, yeah, I-I might.

21:02.580 --> 21:06.620
No. You will.
You have to.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.170
Or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.710
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

21:19.170 --> 21:20.960
Honestly?

21:20.960 --> 21:22.380
Yeah.

21:27.790 --> 21:31.000
I'd go back and never buy
that bottle of wine.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.620
Really?

21:37.170 --> 21:40.620
I guess what I mean is,
uh...

21:40.620 --> 21:46.210
Sometimes you make
small choices in life...

21:46.210 --> 21:49.460
and they -- you don't realize
as you're making them

21:49.460 --> 21:52.000
how much they can
affect everything.

21:55.830 --> 21:59.420
Sorry. One sec.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.580
Hey, Regina.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.580
Regina: Hey.
Something happened at work.

22:04.580 --> 22:05.710
Gina, what's wrong?

22:05.710 --> 22:07.920
I just really need
to talk to someone.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.750
Okay, okay.
Talk to me.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.920
Eddie: Gary.
Why do you have a dog?

22:11.920 --> 22:13.170
I don't have a dog.

22:13.170 --> 22:14.540
Hey, buddy.
That's Colin.

22:14.540 --> 22:16.330
Technically, he's my guest
for the evening,

22:16.330 --> 22:18.330
since he followed me home.

22:18.330 --> 22:21.170
The shelter's closed till
morning, but he's not my dog.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.330
But you, uh --
you named him Colin?

22:23.330 --> 22:24.710
Well, he looks like
a Colin, right?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.750
He's got a certain,
you know, dignity.

22:28.830 --> 22:31.040
Listen, Gary. I was
hoping to talk to you
about me and Katherine.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.250
Katherine?

22:32.250 --> 22:34.210
Your wife?
Your wife, Katherine?

22:34.210 --> 22:36.080
I know exactly
what you're gonna say.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.250
No, you don't.
Dude, listen.

22:37.250 --> 22:40.250
Not everybody
can have what

22:40.250 --> 22:42.210
Jon and Delilah have,
all right?

22:42.210 --> 22:45.540
Ed, nobody should have
what you and Katherine have.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.920
You deserve someone

22:47.920 --> 22:49.960
that you are
excited about, man.

22:51.790 --> 22:54.540
That's just it.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.750
I think I --

23:01.380 --> 23:02.540
Oh.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.960
Let me guess.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.290
Katherine has
disappointed you again.

23:06.290 --> 23:08.540
Wh-- Uh, yeah.
She's, uh, stuck at work.

23:08.540 --> 23:10.080
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Hey, no!

23:10.080 --> 23:11.710
I put my face there.
Come on!

23:41.580 --> 23:44.330
And when it happened,
I felt so...

23:44.330 --> 23:48.620
...worthless and used.

23:48.620 --> 23:54.750
And by that creep, sure,
but also by my boss.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.290
All he had to do
was be on my side.

23:57.290 --> 23:58.460
I'm sorry, Gina.

23:58.460 --> 24:01.830
It's just...

24:01.830 --> 24:03.290
frustrating.
Listen.

24:03.290 --> 24:05.040
What happened to you today
was wrong.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.460
Y-You deserve better than
to have to feel unsafe at work.

24:08.460 --> 24:10.120
You need to get
your own place again.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.670
Yeah, I know.
I will someday --

24:13.670 --> 24:15.670
No, no.

24:15.670 --> 24:17.620
You can someday yourself
right out of a life.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.040
Trust me.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.960
Thank you.
Always.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
Hey,
I'm glad you called.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.620
Me too.

24:25.620 --> 24:26.960
Bye, Jon.

24:32.620 --> 24:36.000
Mm-hmm.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Okay. Ash.
Tomorrow,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.880
we need to close on
the Griffin Street building.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.710
I want that restaurant.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.330
They've been dragging their feet
for a year.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.920
You really think we can
close in one day?

24:45.920 --> 24:48.080
I can be very persuasive
when I want to be.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.330
Um, hey, while we're checking
things off the to-do list,

24:53.330 --> 24:54.670
can you sign this
for me real quick?

24:54.670 --> 24:56.670
What is it?
Uh, my lawyer's
been bothering me

24:56.670 --> 24:59.000
to finish
these trust forms.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.880
You're making me
trustee?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.080
Yeah.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.170
Why?

25:03.170 --> 25:06.500
'Cause I trust you
with my life.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
Should we go?
Uh, yeah. Just need one sec.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.670
Okay.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.960
-Hey.
-Whoa! My God!

25:48.960 --> 25:50.540
Did you get it?
-You bet I did!

25:50.540 --> 25:52.880
We are going to the Super Bowl
because your man,

25:52.880 --> 25:54.460
he got it.
-Whoo!

25:54.460 --> 25:56.380
I'm so proud of you.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.580
Oh, my --
You really did it.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.750
So -- So what are you
gonna have?

25:59.750 --> 26:01.540
Y-Y-You want to have
the gourmet chocolates?

26:01.540 --> 26:04.620
You want to have --
Oh, how about the smoked cheese?

26:04.620 --> 26:07.420
Oh, soup mix -- seven different
kinds of soup mix.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.000
I think I'm never picking up
a fork again.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Oh! Does this mean
we get to go to Kona?

26:13.460 --> 26:16.080
Baby,
we might buy Kona.

26:16.080 --> 26:16.920
Oh.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.460
"Savor it, Rome.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.670
It doesn't get better
than this."

26:22.080 --> 26:23.620
Wow. This is great.

26:36.580 --> 26:37.960
Oh.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.420
Do you own anything
that isn't Bruins related?

26:45.290 --> 26:47.210
Well, how else would
you know it's mine?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.880
Can you
do me a favor?

26:50.880 --> 26:52.880
Anything.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.830
Please don't tell anybody
about this place.

26:57.290 --> 26:58.460
I just, uh...

26:58.460 --> 26:59.960
Hey.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.790
Your secret's
safe with me.

27:01.790 --> 27:04.790
Thanks for everything, Ash.
Yeah.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.830
Jon...

28:05.500 --> 28:07.920
Oh, my God.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.290
I can't believe
you're here.

28:09.290 --> 28:11.620
I just couldn't stand the
thought of you sitting alone.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.540
Is it okay
that I'm here?

28:14.540 --> 28:17.540
Well, this is the one place
I know he's not gonna be.

28:19.710 --> 28:21.710
He didn't even call.

28:21.710 --> 28:25.210
I tried to make it
as painless as possible.

28:25.210 --> 28:26.880
I planned everything.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.620
I got a hotel room
so he could be alone,

28:28.620 --> 28:30.040
and I made sure
the kids were gone

28:30.040 --> 28:33.420
and the fridge
was stocked and...

28:33.420 --> 28:37.620
The only thing Jon
had to do was...

28:37.620 --> 28:41.420
be here.
He couldn't even do that.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.380
Well, Katherine didn't even come
home so we could end things.

28:47.380 --> 28:49.250
So...

28:49.250 --> 28:51.670
somebody finally
decided to show up.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.250
I, um --
I got a little held up.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.790
Do you have any idea
how much bread we've eaten

28:58.790 --> 28:59.920
waiting on you?

28:59.920 --> 29:02.080
Well, um...

29:02.080 --> 29:04.830
Well, we've never quite
gotten the timing thing down.

29:04.830 --> 29:09.830
I hate that it took
so long to get here.

29:09.830 --> 29:14.620
But I promise you,
it'll never happen again.

29:29.460 --> 29:32.880
Can't sleep, huh?

29:32.880 --> 29:35.120
Me either.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.960
I got to be honest, bud.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.790
I'm a little nervous.

29:40.790 --> 29:45.120
Tomorrow at noon, my entire life
could be completely different.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.120
So you see?

29:52.120 --> 29:55.960
This -- This is...

29:55.960 --> 29:58.460
This is why we could
never work out.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.880
Oh, pal.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.880
All right,
if we're not gonna sleep,

30:04.880 --> 30:07.120
would you like
some midnight bacon?

30:30.040 --> 30:32.040
I'm sorry.

30:52.830 --> 30:57.040
Hey, I was thinking
we should celebrate.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.460
Let's go out tonight.

30:59.460 --> 31:01.460
I mean, candied plums
are great and all,

31:01.460 --> 31:04.540
but they can't beat the view
at Top of the Hub.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.960
Are you okay, babe?

31:10.960 --> 31:13.750
No, no, Gina.
I'm just...

31:16.460 --> 31:18.920
I just...

31:18.920 --> 31:20.790
What is it?

31:20.790 --> 31:24.380
I don't know.
I'm psyched.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.040
I'm psyched. I'm just --
I think I'm --

31:26.040 --> 31:28.210
I think I'm hungover
from last night's champagne.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.210
Well,
take some ibuprofen

31:33.210 --> 31:35.710
and put your best
business casual on.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.960
Because I am
taking you out...

31:39.960 --> 31:41.170
for a night
to a remember.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.580
Love you.

31:53.790 --> 31:55.420
I love you, too.

31:59.330 --> 32:02.250
Well, there he is.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.580
He's big,
but he's a softie.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.580
What? It's true.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.790
I'm sorry.
You are a softie.

32:09.790 --> 32:12.170
All right.
We're all good to go.

32:12.170 --> 32:14.250
Don't you want to
know his name?

32:14.250 --> 32:16.250
Nah. It -- It's --
It's cool.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.080
Y-You see,
the new owners, they --

32:18.080 --> 32:20.290
they usually want to
rename them anyway.

32:20.290 --> 32:22.830
-Oh, sure.
-Yeah. Come on, buddy. Come on.

32:22.830 --> 32:26.790
Uh, what...happens now?

32:26.790 --> 32:29.380
Well, we'll take him
down to the shelter

32:29.380 --> 32:31.120
and try to find him
a new home.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.620
Well, what do you mean
"try"?

32:32.620 --> 32:37.170
Well, typically
older, bigger dogs,

32:37.170 --> 32:39.500
they're a little bit more
challenging to place.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.880
You see, parents, they normally
want to get their kids puppies.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.380
You know, ones with
more good years left.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.210
Got to love that new dog smell.
Yeah.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.290
Hey, look,
we'll give him the two weeks,

32:50.290 --> 32:52.500
and hopefully
someone will want him.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.040
Two weeks? Come on, dude.
That's nothing.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.880
Two weeks?

32:55.880 --> 32:57.120
What happens
after two weeks?

32:59.790 --> 33:02.540
Uh, w-- well, look, I --

33:02.540 --> 33:03.920
I don't really want to say it
in front of the --

33:03.920 --> 33:05.330
Got it.

33:05.330 --> 33:07.920
Well, thank you, man.
Yeah.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.920
Hey. Come on. Come on.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.420
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.040
Colin.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.880
That's his name.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.670
It's Colin.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.500
Look. I know you're
a very independent woman.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.670
It's one of the things
I love the most about you.

33:29.670 --> 33:33.170
But just know you don't have
to go through your life alone.

33:33.170 --> 33:35.670
Dad, you don't
have to worry about me.
Get out there.

33:35.670 --> 33:38.040
Make some friends.
Join a support group.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.500
Dr. Harrison says that
building a community

33:40.500 --> 33:42.830
is key to your ongoing wellness,
even in remission.

33:42.830 --> 33:44.920
Yeah. You memorize that
from a pamphlet?

33:44.920 --> 33:48.040
I'll never tell.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.710
I love you, kiddo.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.540
I love you, too, Dad.

33:56.210 --> 33:57.790
Send Mom my love.

33:57.790 --> 33:59.540
I was going to whether
you said to or not,

33:59.540 --> 34:02.880
but it's good
to hear you say it.

34:11.210 --> 34:14.210
I can't do this
anymore.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.540
He left this morning before
I could even yell at him.

34:16.540 --> 34:17.750
It's been two years,
Eddie.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.210
I've tried everything.
-I feel the same way.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.290
I can't be in
this marriage anymore,

34:21.290 --> 34:22.880
and I want to be
with you.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.920
Now, in exactly
5 hours, 12 minutes,

34:24.920 --> 34:26.290
Katherine's
gonna come home,

34:26.290 --> 34:27.250
and she's gonna
want to get

34:27.250 --> 34:29.250
take-out Indian food.
Again.

34:29.250 --> 34:31.080
My people
are from Milwaukee.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.830
We weren't bred to eat
that much vindaloo.

34:32.830 --> 34:35.080
What about Theo?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.670
What are you
gonna tell Theo?

34:36.670 --> 34:38.620
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Theo.

34:38.620 --> 34:42.170
Maybe that Daddy
needs to be happy.

34:42.170 --> 34:44.790
Damn it. See you soon.

34:44.790 --> 34:46.170
I love you.
-Love you, too.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.580
Jon.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.290
Eugene: Sweetie,
you can't keep running away.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.620
What's going on?

35:28.620 --> 35:31.620
I-I needed
a clean break,

35:31.620 --> 35:33.460
no drawn-out goodbyes...

35:33.460 --> 35:35.790
...no second-guessing.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.460
Well...

35:39.460 --> 35:41.460
...no matter
where you are,

35:41.460 --> 35:45.830
just know that we're both
so proud of you.

35:47.830 --> 35:49.170
Dad...

35:49.170 --> 35:50.670
I'm just so happy
you're better.

Thanks, Allan.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.040
You should answer it.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.040
Just --
Just so that, um...

39:58.040 --> 40:00.080
No, I'll call him
in 10 minutes from the car.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.830
Eddie: Hey, you've reached
Eddie. Leave me a message.

40:02.830 --> 40:05.830
Thanks.

40:05.830 --> 40:07.830
Hey, it's Jon. Uh...

40:07.830 --> 40:11.000
I was hoping to speak to you,
not just leave a message, but...

40:14.250 --> 40:16.580
...I just need you
to do me a favor.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.170
Love each other.

40:38.460 --> 40:40.290
Hey, Peggy. Are you ready
to go to lunch?

40:40.290 --> 40:43.460
Peggy: Yeah.
Let me go grab my coat.

40:43.460 --> 40:44.620
Ashley Morales?

40:44.620 --> 40:45.960
Yeah.

40:52.210 --> 40:54.710
Thanks. Have a good one.
Thank you.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.710
Jon:
If you could do anything with
your life, what would you do?

41:11.710 --> 41:13.290
I'm not the man
everyone thinks I am.

41:13.290 --> 41:15.710
'Cause I trust you
with my life.

41:15.710 --> 41:18.040
Ashley, I got this. Why don't
you take a long lunch?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.040
Dr. Martin: That brownish liquid
next to the edamame

41:39.040 --> 41:40.500
is called --
Sorry.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.040
I don't mean to interrupt
what sounds like

41:42.040 --> 41:44.040
a super important
salad conversation.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.830
I just have
one quick question.

41:45.830 --> 41:47.670
Is my cancer back?

41:47.670 --> 41:48.880
No, Gary.
You're fine.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.250
Uh, one second
while I handle this.

41:51.250 --> 41:53.670
How hard is it to find
balsamic vinaigrette?

42:05.380 --> 42:07.210
Okay, Jon, listen.
Just listen.

42:07.210 --> 42:08.580
I'm sorry about
the way we left things,

42:08.580 --> 42:09.750
but I got a surprise for you.

42:09.750 --> 42:11.210
I got a dog!

42:11.210 --> 42:13.960
How's that
for commitment --

42:13.960 --> 42:16.380
Ashley.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.960
What's wrong?
