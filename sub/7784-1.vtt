01:22.749 --> 01:27.669
You'd better pray to the Lord
When you see those flying saucers

01:27.754 --> 01:31.090
It may be the coming of the Judgment Day

01:38.139 --> 01:42.518
Hey, Jerry, you might wanna check this
one out. Palomar just picked it up.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.479
Looks like some type of UFO,
and it's heading this way.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.981
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:48.066 --> 01:50.484
UFOs don't exist
and we're never gonna see...

01:51.945 --> 01:56.281
- Wow, its energy signature is massive.
- Holy Cheez-Its! What do we do?!

01:56.366 --> 01:57.616
No one told us what to do!

01:57.700 --> 02:00.410
I took this job because
you never have to do anything!

02:00.495 --> 02:03.497
Jerry, stop it.
Let me calculate its impact point.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.958
Looks like...

02:07.210 --> 02:09.294
...Modesto, California.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.714
Supernova, this is Red Dwarf.
We actually have one!

02:12.799 --> 02:15.968
Code Nimoy! I repeat, Code Nimoy!

03:08.104 --> 03:11.690
What are you guys doing here?
It's 5:00 in the morning.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.942
Hurry, turn on the TV! Turn it on now!

03:14.027 --> 03:17.571
...and some early morning fog,
giving way to sunny skies.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.114
Seventy-five degrees.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.367
A perfect day to stop by
the old folk art and craft show

03:22.452 --> 03:27.456
down at the fairgrounds, or a
perfect day to marry Susan Murphy.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.335
I love you, baby.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.836
I love you, too.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.925
And good morning, Modesto!

03:39.219 --> 03:40.594
Channel 172.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.814
You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.733
Thanks, Mom.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.243
My little girl!

04:04.494 --> 04:05.786
Daddy!

04:05.995 --> 04:09.539
Now, I want you to know that, even
though I'm about to give you away...

04:10.708 --> 04:13.627
...I will always be here
to take care of you.

04:13.711 --> 04:17.673
Don't cry because then you'll make me
cry, and that's just gonna be a mess.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.382
I can't help it!

04:22.553 --> 04:25.013
Hello, everyone! Attention, attention!

04:25.098 --> 04:27.474
Wedding starts in 30 minutes!

04:27.558 --> 04:30.269
- My beautiful daughter-in-law!
- Hi, Mama Dietl.

04:30.353 --> 04:34.690
It's like a fairy tale. The Weatherman
and the Weatherman's Wife.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.608
Romantic.

04:36.943 --> 04:41.863
I know. Just think, this time tomorrow,
I'm gonna be in Paris!

04:42.031 --> 04:44.491
And someday, we won't
just be honeymooning there.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.786
Derek will become an anchor
or a foreign correspondent.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.707
- And we'll travel all over the world.
- Honey, my fingers are crossed.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.422
One thumb is shorter than the other.
Runs in the family.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.048
Derek doesn't have that.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.968
It skips a generation.
Your kids are gonna have it!

05:13.062 --> 05:14.646
Wow, you look beautiful.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.150
So do you. I mean, handsome.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.611
I mean...
Sorry. I'm just a little frazzled.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.989
I just spent way too much time
with our parents.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.743
Don't worry, OK?
We'll be alone soon, just us.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.413
Eating cheese and baguettes
by the Seine,

05:31.539 --> 05:33.874
feeding each other chocolate crepes.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.380
- Is something wrong?
- No, no! It's just that, well...

05:41.466 --> 05:44.009
There's been a slight change of plans.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.720
We're not going to Paris.

05:46.804 --> 05:51.391
- What? Why not?
- Because we're going somewhere better.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.352
- Better than Paris?
- Oh, yeah.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.645
Where? Tahiti?!

05:55.730 --> 05:58.148
Nope! Fresno!

05:58.232 --> 05:59.900
Fresno!

06:00.526 --> 06:01.860
Fresno.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.697
In what universe is Fresno
better than Paris, Derek?

06:05.782 --> 06:08.867
In the "I've got an audition to become

06:08.951 --> 06:12.245
Channel 23's new
evening anchor" universe.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.166
Got the call from the general manager,
he wants me to come in immediately!

06:16.250 --> 06:19.628
- Isn't that great?
- Derek!

06:20.296 --> 06:21.880
That's...

06:21.964 --> 06:25.217
...amazing! It's amazing.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.594
Fresno's a top 50 market, isn't it?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.971
It's 55th, but we're on our way, babe!

06:31.933 --> 06:33.558
Now, look. About Paris...

06:34.268 --> 06:37.896
It's OK. It's fine!
As long as we're together,

06:37.980 --> 06:41.691
Fresno is the most
romantic city in the whole world.

06:42.151 --> 06:46.696
- I'm so proud of you.
- Of us! Not just of me.

06:46.781 --> 06:51.326
I mean, of course, but we're a team now.
You're so proud of us.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.288
Now, get out of here.
It's bad luck to see me in my dress.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.833
Come on. You know
I don't believe in that stuff.

06:57.959 --> 07:02.462
I'll be waiting for you at the altar...
the handsome news anchor in the tux.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.798
Love you! There, I said it.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.676
I love you, too.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.502
Susan!

07:44.130 --> 07:45.881
Where could she be?

07:45.965 --> 07:49.176
Susan! Where are you?!

07:56.476 --> 07:58.768
Susan! Where have you been?!

07:58.978 --> 08:01.730
I think I just got hit by a meteorite.

08:01.814 --> 08:06.568
Oh, Susan. Every bride feels
that way on her wedding day.

08:06.652 --> 08:10.864
My goodness, look at you. You're filthy.
Thank God I have Wet Ones.

08:47.777 --> 08:48.944
Wow.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.363
You're glowing.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.449
Thank you.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.870
No. No, Susan, you're, like,
really glowing. You're green!

09:01.207 --> 09:02.999
Oh, no!

09:04.126 --> 09:05.293
Derek!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.799
Oh, my gosh!

09:11.050 --> 09:12.217
What's going on?!

09:12.301 --> 09:15.220
- What's happening?!
- You're all shrinking!

09:15.304 --> 09:17.472
Uh-uh! You're growing!

09:17.557 --> 09:20.267
- Well, make it stop!
- Get me the government!

09:22.436 --> 09:23.478
This is impossible!

09:25.398 --> 09:27.983
No, this can't be happening.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.570
Wait, wait. Everybody, it's OK!

09:31.654 --> 09:33.738
Have some champagne
while we're figuring this out!

09:34.490 --> 09:36.324
Thumbs! Thumbs!

09:38.578 --> 09:41.079
Derek! Help me!

09:44.208 --> 09:45.584
Sweet Lord!

09:50.965 --> 09:55.510
- Here comes the bride!
- Oh, Carl! It's her wedding day!

09:57.346 --> 09:59.681
Derek? Derek?

10:00.141 --> 10:02.309
Beam hurt Derek.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.312
- Susan?
- Thank goodness you're OK!

10:06.606 --> 10:07.897
What's happening to me?

10:08.190 --> 10:12.068
Don't panic! Don't worry!
Whatever you do, don't drop...

10:13.237 --> 10:15.572
- Derek!
- Sorry, sir.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.283
Who are you people?
What are you doing?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.703
Stop it! Be careful!

10:22.371 --> 10:25.332
Get your hands off me!
Don't you know who I am?!

10:25.416 --> 10:28.126
Please, just leave me alone!

10:36.969 --> 10:40.138
Watch those cables!
She's coming down!

10:42.558 --> 10:43.558
Watch out!

10:46.812 --> 10:49.439
Move it, move it!
Let's go! Move it, move it!

10:49.815 --> 10:51.483
Pull, pull!

10:53.194 --> 10:55.070
Derek?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.866
All right, let's get
this baby on the bus.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.583
Honey, could you hit the snooze?

11:11.170 --> 11:15.173
Baby, why did you set the alarm?
We're on our honeymoon.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.181
Hello?

11:24.266 --> 11:25.934
What's going on?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.190
Hello?

12:31.167 --> 12:34.252
Is it just legs?
Did they capture a giant pair of legs?

12:34.336 --> 12:36.171
Silence, B.O.B.! She'll hear us!

12:36.338 --> 12:40.008
- How? Legs don't have ears.
- Just shush!

12:42.344 --> 12:44.137
Hello?

12:45.514 --> 12:48.141
Is there someone there?

12:48.225 --> 12:50.226
Could you tell me where I am?

13:05.868 --> 13:08.453
Hello? What was that?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.004
Hello.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.383
Will you stop...?! Careful!

13:23.385 --> 13:25.303
Please, madam!

13:25.387 --> 13:27.555
Stop! Doing! That!

13:31.352 --> 13:34.562
Whatever mad scientist made you,

13:34.688 --> 13:37.232
he really went all out.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.236
You can talk.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.245
Hi, there!

13:51.580 --> 13:52.997
My back!

13:53.749 --> 13:55.542
Just kidding! I don't have a back!

13:56.377 --> 14:00.171
Forgive him, but as you can see,
he has no brain.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.841
Turns out you don't need one.
Totally overrated!

14:02.925 --> 14:05.009
As a matter of fact, I don't even...

14:07.847 --> 14:10.265
I forgot how to breathe!
Don't know how to breathe!

14:10.766 --> 14:12.767
Help me, Dr. Cockroach! Help!

14:12.852 --> 14:15.144
Suck in, B.O.B.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.400
Thanks, Doc. You're a lifesaver.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.444
Wow, look at you.
I know what you're thinking.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.156
First day in prison, you want to
take down the toughest guy in the yard.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.075
Well, I'd like to see you try.

14:33.956 --> 14:34.956
Ninja!

14:40.921 --> 14:44.549
- Gosh. Look, she's speechless.
- She?

14:44.633 --> 14:49.470
Yes, B.O.B.! We are in the presence
of the rare female monster.

14:49.597 --> 14:53.141
No way! It's a boy. Look at his boobies.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.059
We need to have a talk.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.855
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we are not making
a very good first impression.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.189
At least I'm talking.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.484
First new monster in years, we
couldn't get a wolf man or a mummy?

15:03.569 --> 15:06.070
Just, you know,
somebody to play cards with.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.867
Might we ask your name, madam?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.077
Susan.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.496
No, no, no. We mean your monster name.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.416
Like, what do people scream
when they see you coming?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.336
You know, like,
"Look out! Here comes...!"

15:22.546 --> 15:23.796
Susan.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.715
Really?

15:25.799 --> 15:27.550
Susan!

15:27.635 --> 15:30.345
I just scared myself. That is scary.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.221
Yes! Eat times.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.355
That is repulsive!

15:42.066 --> 15:43.316
An old slipper!

15:51.825 --> 15:53.952
Oh, please, God,
tell me this isn't real.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.121
Please tell me I had a nervous
breakdown at the wedding, and now I'm

15:57.206 --> 16:01.000
in a mental hospital on medication
that's giving me hallucinations.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.553
Don't scare Insectosaurus!

16:12.680 --> 16:15.348
He's gonna pee himself,
then we'll all be in trouble.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.476
Every room has a door!
There's gotta be a door here!

16:18.560 --> 16:21.813
It's OK, buddy. Don't worry about it.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.942
Who's a handsome bug, huh?
You like it when I rub your tummy?

16:27.611 --> 16:30.989
Please! Somebody!
I don't belong here!

16:31.073 --> 16:33.992
- Let me out!
- Hey, that is not a good idea.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.744
Let me out!

16:48.590 --> 16:51.509
Monsters, get back in your cells.

17:11.905 --> 17:16.826
Oh, thank goodness. A real person.
You are a real person, right?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.662
Not one of those
half-person, half-machine,

17:19.747 --> 17:22.205
you know, whatever
you call those things.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.626
- A cyborg?
- Oh, no! You're a cyborg?!

17:25.711 --> 17:30.423
Madam, I assure you, I am not a cyborg.
The name is General W.R. Monger.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.593
I'm in charge of this facility.
Now, follow me.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.012
It is time for your orientation.

17:46.482 --> 17:50.318
In 1950, it was decided that Jane and
Joe Public could not handle the truth

17:50.402 --> 17:54.697
about monsters, and should focus on more
important things, like paying taxes.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.325
So the government convinced the world

17:57.409 --> 18:01.496
monsters were stuff of myth and legend
and then locked them in this facility.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.878
But I'm not a monster!
I'm just a regular person.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.173
I'm not a danger to anyone or anything.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.635
Don't let her get me!

18:16.136 --> 18:17.178
Sorry.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.438
- How long will I be here?
- Indefinitely.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.315
- Can I contact my parents?
- No.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.566
- Derek?
- Negative.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.611
- Do they know where I am?
- No, and they never will!

18:34.029 --> 18:35.863
This place is an X file,

18:35.948 --> 18:39.408
wrapped in a cover-up
and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.912
There will be zero contact
with the outside world.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.691
...seven, eight...

19:12.651 --> 19:15.194
...999...

19:15.696 --> 19:17.363
...1,000.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.490
I can't believe I did ten sets.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.877
Susan!

19:30.961 --> 19:33.629
You wouldn't happen to have
any uranium on you?

19:33.714 --> 19:35.089
I just need a smidge.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.384
Rescind Dr. Cockroach's toy box
privileges immediately.

19:39.261 --> 19:43.389
We had the prison psychologist
redecorate your cell.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.849
Try to keep you all calm-like.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.768
But I don't want a poster.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.522
I want a real kitten hanging
from a real tree.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.650
I want to go home.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.404
Come on, little Debbie, please
don't cry. It makes my knees hurt.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.114
Don't think of this as a prison.

20:00.699 --> 20:05.119
Think of it as a hotel you never leave
because it's locked from the outside!

20:08.790 --> 20:10.583
Oh, and one other thing.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.502
The government has changed
your name to Ginormica.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.306
Begin reanimation sequence.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.148
Who dares to wake me?

21:16.233 --> 21:22.238
Quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the Omega Quadrant.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.783
The Omega Quadrant? Lame.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.287
The trajectory of the
Quantonium meteor

21:29.371 --> 21:33.541
has been traced to sector 72-4,

21:33.667 --> 21:37.169
the planet locally known as Earth.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.673
What a miserable-looking mud ball.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.217
Send a robot probe!

21:44.720 --> 21:49.932
Extract the Quantonium
with extreme prejudice.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.893
I want it all.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.896
Every last drop!

21:55.981 --> 21:58.232
Yes, Gallaxhar.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.820
Nothing can stand in my way now.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.927
Don't rush me, Katie!
I'm just not ready.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.806
Relax, Cuthbert.
It's just like dancing. I'll lead.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.772
Katie, I have a gymnastics
meet tomorrow. So maybe...

22:38.440 --> 22:39.565
Did you open the top?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.194
Thank goodness. It's the police.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.947
- We weren't doing anything, officer!
- Yeah, nothing at all.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.162
Jiminy!

22:53.622 --> 22:57.958
Why did I even let you talk me into
this?! Maybe we should get out of here.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.587
- Or, maybe, we should go check it out.
- Katie, are you nuts?!

23:02.464 --> 23:04.423
Wait! Don't leave me alone!

23:08.720 --> 23:10.471
No! My ankle!

23:10.889 --> 23:12.056
I think it's broken!

23:13.100 --> 23:14.141
Katie?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.229
This is the worst date ever.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.782
Katie, I'm frightened.

23:38.500 --> 23:43.462
It was first spotted at midnight last
night by a couple in romantic embrace.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.924
No one knows what it is
or where it came from.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.845
All branches of the military
were immediately mobilized.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.179
What is that, Henshaw?

23:52.848 --> 23:53.889
OK.

23:54.307 --> 23:58.269
I have just received word that
the president of the United States

23:58.353 --> 24:02.314
has arrived and will
attempt to make first contact.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.525
I must approach it alone.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.695
This is all about
peaceful communication.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.989
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

24:43.064 --> 24:46.400
Perimeter stable. Got a bead
on Papa Bear. All clear.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.867
- Let's go!
- Get out of the way!

26:59.951 --> 27:01.660
Set her down now. Here we go!

27:13.548 --> 27:15.799
Commander, do something violent!

27:16.259 --> 27:18.218
You heard the president! Light 'em up!

27:26.394 --> 27:30.814
We're getting pummeled here! Call in
air support! Call in air support!

27:52.253 --> 27:54.922
Call in... Call in a full retreat!

27:55.256 --> 27:57.716
Full retreat! Full retreat, all troops!

27:59.511 --> 28:01.595
- Wheels up. Papa Bear is on the move.
- Wait.

28:02.722 --> 28:06.433
So that's how you want to play it?
Eat lead, alien robot!

28:08.687 --> 28:10.604
- Evidently, they eat lead.
- Get him on the chopper.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.941
I'm brave! I'm a brave president!

28:16.778 --> 28:18.070
Get out of the way!

28:34.629 --> 28:37.965
- Sir! We need to declare a...
- We need to overthrow that robot

28:38.049 --> 28:41.677
- and install our own government!
- Let's sacrifice the elderly to it!

28:41.761 --> 28:44.805
- I say we invade it!
- The Earth only has two weeks left!

28:44.889 --> 28:48.851
If that thing walks into a populated
area there'll be a major catastrophe!

28:48.935 --> 28:51.812
We need our top scientific minds
on this. Get India on the phone!

28:51.896 --> 28:53.939
Can we transport the United States
to a safer planet?

28:54.023 --> 28:57.317
Give this alien a green card and
make him proud to be an American.

28:57.402 --> 29:02.322
It's at dire times like this when I stop
and ask myself, "What would Oprah do?"

29:02.407 --> 29:06.285
Hang it all! What's the point?
It's a disaster.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.371
- Stop! No!
- Don't do it!

29:10.123 --> 29:12.040
That button launches
our nuclear missiles!

29:12.125 --> 29:14.001
Well, which button gets me a latte?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.962
That would be the other one, sir.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.969
- What idiot designed this thing?
- You did, sir.

29:25.096 --> 29:28.307
- Fair enough. Wilson, fire somebody!
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.769
Listen up. I'm not going
to go down in history

29:31.853 --> 29:33.729
as the president who was in office

29:33.813 --> 29:35.314
when the world came to an end,

29:35.398 --> 29:38.150
so somebody think of something,
and think of it fast!

29:40.195 --> 29:42.780
- That is a good cup of joe.
- Mr. President?

29:45.658 --> 29:49.620
Not only do I have an idea,
but I have a plan!

29:54.292 --> 29:57.002
Now, conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing,

29:57.086 --> 30:01.131
- and we know nukes ain't an option.
- Sure they are. I just...

30:02.008 --> 30:03.759
- Don't do it! Stop!
- Wait!

30:04.219 --> 30:07.971
I'm not gonna kid you, Mr. President.
These are dark times.

30:08.223 --> 30:13.393
The odds are against us. We need a Hail
Mary pass. We need raw power! We need...

30:14.229 --> 30:15.479
...monsters.

30:17.899 --> 30:21.401
Monsters! Of course! It's so simple!

30:22.821 --> 30:24.905
I... I'm not following you.

30:25.240 --> 30:29.451
Over the last 50 years, I have captured
monsters on the rampage,

30:29.536 --> 30:32.079
and locked them up
in a secret prison facility.

30:32.455 --> 30:37.709
So secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.336
Is he referring to Area Fifty...

30:42.423 --> 30:46.218
Mr. President,
say hello to Insectosaurus!

30:48.596 --> 30:50.055
Miss Ronson, please.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.017
Nuclear radiation turned him
from a small grub

30:54.102 --> 30:58.105
into a 350-foot-tall
monster that attacked Tokyo.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.733
Here we have the Missing Link.

31:05.071 --> 31:09.700
A 20,000-year-old frozen fish man
who was thawed out by scientists.

31:10.201 --> 31:14.746
He escaped and went on a rampage
in his old watering hole.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.292
This handsome fellow
is Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.,

31:18.376 --> 31:20.502
the most brilliant man in the world.

31:21.296 --> 31:24.798
He invented a scientific machine

31:24.966 --> 31:29.052
that would give humans
the cockroach's ability to survive.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.722
Unfortunately, there was a side effect.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.811
Now, we call this thing B.O.B.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.564
Will someone get her out of here?!

31:42.901 --> 31:43.984
Thank you.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.405
A genetically altered tomato was
combined with a chemically altered

31:48.489 --> 31:51.825
ranch-flavored dessert topping
at a snack food plant.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.661
The resulting goop
gained consciousness,

31:54.746 --> 31:58.248
and became an
indestructible gelatinous mass.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.669
And, our latest addition, Ginormica.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.425
General, continue.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.721
Her entire body radiates
with pure energy,

32:12.805 --> 32:15.307
giving her enormous strength and size.

32:16.309 --> 32:20.771
Sir, these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.440
Don't we already have
an alien problem, General?

32:23.524 --> 32:26.610
I don't think we need
a monster problem, too.

32:26.694 --> 32:28.862
You got a better idea, nerd?

32:32.867 --> 32:34.451
OK. Stay where you are.

32:35.703 --> 32:38.038
General, I propose we go forward

32:38.122 --> 32:41.458
with your monsters-versus-aliens
idea... thingy.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.293
Go fish.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.220
Do you...

32:54.055 --> 32:55.722
...have any...

32:57.183 --> 32:58.225
...threes?

32:58.559 --> 33:01.603
Yes. I do! How are you doing this?

33:01.688 --> 33:05.065
- You're the luckiest guy I know.
- Luck ain't got nothin' to do with it.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.360
What the...? Hey!

33:11.739 --> 33:16.576
They called me crazy,
but I'll show them. I'll show them all!

33:18.871 --> 33:22.749
Doctor, I'd prefer you didn't do
your mad scientist laugh

33:22.834 --> 33:24.751
while I'm hooked up to this machine.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.714
You're right, Insecto.

33:29.090 --> 33:32.467
You've let that quack experiment
on you for over a month.

33:32.552 --> 33:36.722
I'm not a quack! I'm a mad scientist!
There is a difference.

33:36.806 --> 33:41.935
Guys, what choice do I have? If he can
make me normal, or even six foot eight,

33:42.103 --> 33:45.355
I can get out of here, get back
to the life I'm supposed to have.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.733
- I should be in...
- Let me guess, Fresno?

33:47.817 --> 33:51.528
Well, Fresno is just a stepping stone.
Next stop, Milwaukee.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.948
- Then New York, then hopefully...
- Yeah, we know. Paris.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.785
Throw the switch, Doctor,
but don't do the laugh.

33:59.078 --> 34:02.289
Now you're going to feel
a slight pinch in the brain.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.207
Sorry.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.678
Susan!

34:18.222 --> 34:19.723
Am I small again?

34:20.641 --> 34:21.975
I'm afraid not, my dear.

34:26.522 --> 34:30.150
In fact, you may actually
have grown a couple of feet.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.656
That's OK, Doc.
We'll try again tomorrow.

34:36.991 --> 34:41.911
You really don't get it, do you?
No monster has ever gotten out of here!

34:41.996 --> 34:44.498
That's not true! The Invisible Man did.

34:44.831 --> 34:48.460
No, he didn't. We just told you that
so you wouldn't get upset.

34:48.543 --> 34:51.545
He died of a heart attack 25 years ago.

34:51.630 --> 34:52.672
No!

34:53.174 --> 34:55.509
Yeah... in that very chair.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.136
He's still there.

35:01.015 --> 35:04.851
You see what I'm saying? Nobody's
leaving. Nobody's ever getting out.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.146
Good news, monsters! You're getting out!

35:08.773 --> 35:09.815
Until today.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.114
So let me get this straight, Monger.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.825
You want us to fight an alien robot.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.161
And, in exchange,
the president of these United States

35:23.246 --> 35:25.831
authorized me to grant you
your freedom.

35:26.374 --> 35:30.127
I can't believe it!
Soon, I'll be back in Derek's arms...

35:30.670 --> 35:32.045
...or he'll be in mine.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.132
I can't wait for spring break
back at Cocoa Beach, just

35:35.716 --> 35:37.467
freaking everybody out.

35:37.552 --> 35:41.429
And I'll go back to my lab
and finally finish my experiments.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.056
No! That's me, B.O.B.

35:43.599 --> 35:47.894
- Then I'll be a really giant lady.
- That's Susan, B.O.B.

35:47.979 --> 35:52.149
Fine. Then I'll go back to Modesto
and be with Derek.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.817
That's still Susan, B.O.B.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.945
I think I, at least,
deserve a chance to be with Derek!

35:57.029 --> 35:58.196
All right, let's go!

36:21.262 --> 36:24.973
Everybody move in an orderly fashion!
This is an emergency!

36:25.099 --> 36:27.017
We are evacuating the city!

36:27.101 --> 36:30.103
Exact change is appreciated,
but not necessary!

36:59.383 --> 37:01.593
Let's move out!

37:07.975 --> 37:10.810
This is San Francisco!
This isn't far from my home!

37:11.646 --> 37:14.940
Feel the wind on your antennae.
Isn’t this wonderful?

37:15.024 --> 37:18.860
I haven't been outside in 50 years.
It's amazing out here!

37:18.986 --> 37:21.988
It's hotter than I remember.
Has the Earth gotten warmer?

37:22.073 --> 37:25.158
That'd be great to know.
That would be a very convenient truth.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.000
- Now that's a robot!
- It's huge.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.419
Try not to damage it too much.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.672
I might want to bring it
back to the farm!

37:38.756 --> 37:41.925
No, no, no, wait! You didn't say
anything about it being huge!

37:42.009 --> 37:44.094
Wait! No! Don't leave!

37:48.182 --> 37:49.724
I think he sees us.

37:50.059 --> 37:53.353
Hello! Hi! How you doing?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.856
Welcome! We are here to destroy you!

37:56.941 --> 38:00.360
I can't fight that thing.
I can't even... I've never...

38:00.861 --> 38:04.531
I'm hyperventilating.
Does anybody have a giant paper bag?

38:04.615 --> 38:06.616
Relax.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.785
Old Link's got this under control.

38:08.869 --> 38:11.371
Hide in the city, Susan.
You'll be safe there.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.541
But stay away from the Tenderloin!
It's a little dicey!

38:14.625 --> 38:17.961
Finally, some action.
I'm gonna turn that oversized tin can

38:18.045 --> 38:22.048
into a really dented oversized tin can.

38:26.721 --> 38:30.307
OK! Does anybody have
a 20 on Insectosaurus?

38:30.766 --> 38:33.810
Wow!
Would you look at the size of that...

38:33.894 --> 38:34.936
Foot!

38:37.231 --> 38:38.815
I got him, you guys! I got...

38:40.234 --> 38:42.986
Don't worry, I won't let go!
I'm wearing him down!

38:44.030 --> 38:45.739
Please tell me he's slowing down!

38:45.865 --> 38:48.867
Get to the city, Link.
I'll catch up with you as soon as I can.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.415
Or maybe you'll have to
catch up with me.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.920
Oh, no! No, no, no!

40:51.198 --> 40:53.867
OK, OK. I got this.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.048
Yep, that hurt.

41:12.094 --> 41:14.053
Get in! I have a plan!

41:26.484 --> 41:27.525
Hot dogs!

41:35.159 --> 41:39.579
All right, Link, I'm going to pull up
alongside it! You get up in there,

41:39.663 --> 41:42.165
get to its
central processing unit, and...

41:42.249 --> 41:44.209
- Hey, guys, catch me!
- No!

41:51.383 --> 41:54.135
Let's go, let's go! Keep it moving!

41:54.220 --> 41:55.762
Hey! No honking!

42:01.769 --> 42:04.562
Excuse me! Coming through!
On your right! No control!

42:23.958 --> 42:24.958
Oh, no.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.347
OK! It's going to be OK!
Look, I'm gonna get you out of there!

42:39.598 --> 42:42.809
Hold on a second!
We have to get off the bridge before...

43:09.044 --> 43:12.338
No, no, no! Get away from me!

43:29.898 --> 43:31.274
Coming through! Watch it!

43:37.323 --> 43:39.824
Hey, furball, where you been?

43:42.536 --> 43:45.288
Yeah, I know.
Papa's a little out of shape.

43:45.372 --> 43:49.042
Excuse me! He's trying to kill me!
Why is it doing that? Why would it...

44:00.137 --> 44:01.220
Wow.

44:18.405 --> 44:22.408
- Wow. You're doing great!
- I'm doing everything!

44:22.660 --> 44:25.828
Not for long. Come on, you guys.
Let's take this thing down!

44:28.457 --> 44:31.417
A deflector shield. Typical.

44:39.718 --> 44:42.220
You can't crush a cockroach!

44:52.272 --> 44:54.065
Right, right.

44:54.566 --> 44:55.775
Here we go.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.489
Insectosaurus!

45:02.449 --> 45:03.991
Insectosaurus!

45:04.076 --> 45:05.702
- B.O.B.!
- What?

45:05.786 --> 45:07.328
- Help me!
- Sorry.

45:07.413 --> 45:11.457
- I was staring at this bird over there.
- Get these people off the bridge!

45:11.542 --> 45:12.583
Got it.

45:14.545 --> 45:17.630
No, B.O.B.!
Move the dividers!

45:18.632 --> 45:21.342
Oh, yeah, you're right. My bad.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.182
Go, go, go, go!

45:40.654 --> 45:41.696
Link!

45:43.157 --> 45:44.490
Oh, I don't feel good.

45:46.910 --> 45:50.163
OK. Susan, you can do this.

46:37.002 --> 46:40.129
All right. Let's take this thing down.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.099
Retrieval has failed.

46:52.518 --> 46:55.895
Don't get upset.
It happens to everyone.

46:56.897 --> 47:02.735
That lower life form thinks
she can steal my Quantonium?!

47:03.153 --> 47:05.655
Send another probe at once!

47:05.739 --> 47:08.616
Quantonium cannot
be retrieved via robot.

47:08.909 --> 47:13.996
Carbon-based life form, locally known
as Susan, is now too strong.

47:14.081 --> 47:18.835
Oh, you think because
you're all big and strong

47:18.919 --> 47:22.004
and you can destroy my robot probe

47:22.089 --> 47:24.966
that you're gonna send me
running and hiding?!

47:25.759 --> 47:29.345
My days of running and hiding are over!

47:29.429 --> 47:32.932
Computer, set a course to Earth.

47:33.559 --> 47:37.228
I will retrieve the Quantonium myself,

47:37.312 --> 47:40.773
even if I need to rip it out of her body

47:40.858 --> 47:43.651
one cell at a time!

47:47.281 --> 47:49.323
Careful, it's hot.

47:53.579 --> 47:56.998
Three weeks ago, if you had asked me
to defeat a giant alien robot,

47:57.082 --> 48:00.209
I'd have said, "No can do."
But I did it! Me!

48:00.794 --> 48:01.878
I'm still buzzing.

48:02.129 --> 48:05.923
Did you see how strong I was?! Probably
isn't a jar in this world I can't open.

48:06.008 --> 48:09.302
You were positively heroic, my dear.

48:09.386 --> 48:12.263
I especially loved how you
saved those people on the bridge.

48:12.347 --> 48:15.308
It was a nice touch.
Wasn't she amazing, Link?

48:15.392 --> 48:18.811
Yeah, she was great.
Really cool. Loved it.

48:19.313 --> 48:21.355
Oh, poor Link.

48:21.481 --> 48:25.026
After all that tough talk,
you were out-monstered by a girl.

48:26.028 --> 48:30.239
- No wonder you're depressed.
- Hey, I'm not depressed. I'm tired.

48:30.324 --> 48:32.491
Why are you tired?
You didn't do anything.

48:32.576 --> 48:34.493
Well, I haven't been sleeping well.

48:35.037 --> 48:39.290
I got sleep apnes... apnea.
Whatever. It's not fun.

48:39.374 --> 48:43.169
So Link's a little rusty...
I mean, sleep deprived.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.713
You'll be back
to your old self in no time.

48:45.797 --> 48:46.839
And so will I.

48:47.507 --> 48:51.552
What happened to the "there isn't
a jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

48:51.637 --> 48:55.097
Wait. Did you find a jar
you couldn't open? Were pickles in it?

48:55.182 --> 48:59.185
- Where's the giant jar of pickles?!
- What my associate is trying to say

48:59.311 --> 49:03.814
is that we all think the
new Susan is the "cat's me-wow."

49:06.276 --> 49:07.318
I'm sorry.

49:08.153 --> 49:11.864
Thanks, you guys. That is so sweet,

49:11.949 --> 49:16.035
but I have a normal life
waiting for me. You know?

49:16.119 --> 49:20.873
So, tell me, exactly, how this normal
life thing works with you being giant.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.708
I'm not gonna be a giant forever.

49:22.834 --> 49:26.295
Derek won't rest
until we've found a cure for my...

49:27.172 --> 49:29.382
...condition. We're a team.

49:29.633 --> 49:34.762
We could all do with a Derek. Perhaps,
someday, we could make his acquaintance!

49:35.013 --> 49:38.224
Really? You guys want to meet Derek?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.317
First stop, Modesto!

49:48.402 --> 49:52.071
Ginormica, I called your family
to let them know you were coming home.

49:52.155 --> 49:55.992
Now, I also called the Modesto PD
and told them not to shoot at you.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.828
Thanks, General.

50:10.716 --> 50:13.551
OK, remember,
these people aren't used to seeing...

50:14.302 --> 50:15.511
...anything like...

50:16.346 --> 50:18.597
...you, or you...

50:18.932 --> 50:20.141
...or you.

50:20.350 --> 50:24.270
So just be, you know, cool.
Just be... you know...

50:24.354 --> 50:25.813
Follow my lead.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.779
Stop! That was an accident!

50:33.864 --> 50:35.948
Don't destroy anything!

50:39.119 --> 50:40.286
Susan?

50:40.662 --> 50:45.291
- Susie Q!
- Mom? Daddy?

50:46.126 --> 50:52.131
- Did they experiment on you?
- No, Mom. I'm fine.

50:55.761 --> 50:58.137
It's OK. They're with me.

50:58.305 --> 50:59.805
These are my new friends.

51:00.098 --> 51:02.892
Oh, Derek! I missed you so much,

51:02.976 --> 51:05.853
thinking that we'd
someday be together again!

51:05.937 --> 51:09.732
It's the only thing that got me through
prison! I love you! I love this man!

51:09.816 --> 51:13.027
No, B.O.B.! That's my mother!
You're suffocating her!

51:15.113 --> 51:16.655
Honey, are you all right?

51:16.948 --> 51:19.575
- I taste ham.
- Sorry, Mom.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.410
He's just a hugger.

51:22.913 --> 51:23.996
Where's Derek?

51:24.790 --> 51:26.665
He's at work, sweetie.

51:26.833 --> 51:29.794
You know how he is about his career.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.963
- We're not gonna celebrate without him!
- Susan!

51:33.632 --> 51:36.258
What do I do
with all your little friends?

51:36.343 --> 51:39.720
Just put out some snacks!
They'll eat anything!

51:42.349 --> 51:43.849
Ambrosia!

51:47.395 --> 51:48.437
How's it going?

51:48.980 --> 51:50.815
Qué pasa, girlfriend?

51:51.525 --> 51:53.234
Way to cut up a rug, Insecto!

51:57.030 --> 51:58.864
Who wants to go
for a swim with the Link?

52:05.372 --> 52:08.791
Hi. I'm Benzoate-Ostylezene-Bicarbonate.

52:08.875 --> 52:12.044
Or you can call me "B.O.B.",
whichever's easier.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.506
Did I come on too strong? I'm sorry.

52:15.590 --> 52:19.385
I'm a little rusty.
I've been in prison my whole life.

52:19.469 --> 52:20.845
Why'd I mention prison?

52:21.888 --> 52:25.015
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just going to go.

52:25.267 --> 52:26.475
I feel so stupid.

52:27.936 --> 52:32.106
All right, everyone, just stay calm.
Whatever you do, do not provoke them.

52:32.190 --> 52:35.860
Anyone care for an Atomic Gin Fizz?
It's got quite a...

52:38.363 --> 52:39.405
...kick.

52:40.407 --> 52:43.576
Chlorine! Chlorine in my eyes!

52:45.704 --> 52:49.290
- They're turning on us!
- Everyone run for your lives!

52:54.087 --> 52:55.880
What are they running away from?

52:59.593 --> 53:01.385
That's hilarious, Jim.

53:01.928 --> 53:04.680
That's exactly the kind of
down-home country humor

53:04.764 --> 53:06.515
I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

53:06.600 --> 53:10.769
This is Derek Dietl,
signing off for the very last time.

53:11.146 --> 53:15.274
- Good night, Modesto!
- Channel 172.

53:16.151 --> 53:17.610
And cut.

53:20.780 --> 53:23.115
Did you like that sign off?
Just made it up.

53:30.165 --> 53:31.457
Oh, my goodness.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.585
Wait, wait, wait! But, but...!

53:38.215 --> 53:42.301
Oh, Derek. You wouldn't
believe my last three weeks!

53:46.181 --> 53:49.099
Thinking about you was
the only thing that kept me sane.

53:49.935 --> 53:54.480
- Can't breathe! Ribs collapsing!
- Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!

53:55.315 --> 53:57.524
Oh, my goodness. Is that better?

53:58.526 --> 54:00.653
OK. OK.

54:01.780 --> 54:04.406
I'm still kind of getting used to
my new strength.

54:04.491 --> 54:07.076
Wow! You really are big!

54:07.327 --> 54:12.331
Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still
the same girl you fell in love with.

54:12.415 --> 54:15.834
Except you did just destroy
the Golden Gate Bridge.

54:15.919 --> 54:19.004
But that was the only way
I could stop that giant robot!

54:19.881 --> 54:21.799
You ever think I could do
something like that?

54:21.883 --> 54:26.220
No, I didn't. I can honestly say
it never, ever, ever, ever,

54:26.304 --> 54:30.015
ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever occurred to me.

54:30.850 --> 54:33.769
Look, I know this is a little weird.

54:34.312 --> 54:37.815
OK, it's a lot weird,
but we'll figure it out.

54:38.692 --> 54:41.944
I know that, together, we can find
a way to get me back to normal.

54:42.487 --> 54:45.864
Susan, try and look at this
from my perspective.

54:46.324 --> 54:48.951
I have an audience
that depends on me for news,

54:49.035 --> 54:52.288
weather, sports
and heart-warming fluff pieces.

54:53.039 --> 54:54.873
You expect me to put all that on hold

54:54.958 --> 54:57.710
while you try to undo
this thing that happened to you?

54:57.794 --> 55:00.087
That I had absolutely
nothing to do with?

55:00.213 --> 55:03.424
Yes. That's exactly what I expect.

55:04.426 --> 55:08.262
What about the life we always
talked about? Don't you still want that?

55:08.388 --> 55:10.556
Of course. I just...

55:11.558 --> 55:14.101
...don't see how
I can have that with you.

55:14.894 --> 55:18.147
Derek, please, don't do this.

55:18.982 --> 55:20.858
You have to face facts, Susan.

55:21.234 --> 55:24.862
Don't crush me for saying this,
but I'm not looking to get married

55:24.946 --> 55:27.948
and spend the rest of my life
in someone else's shadow.

55:28.950 --> 55:32.328
And you're casting a pretty big shadow.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.913
I'm sorry. It's over.

55:36.916 --> 55:38.208
Good luck, Susan.

56:24.631 --> 56:28.592
Wow! What a shindig!

56:28.968 --> 56:31.970
Your parents really know
how to throw it down.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.140
What? No, that was a great party,

56:35.225 --> 56:37.976
one of the best I've been to
since I got out of prison.

56:38.061 --> 56:40.437
I must have been at a different party,

56:40.522 --> 56:43.148
'cause that's not
how I interpreted it at all.

56:43.483 --> 56:47.653
I don't think your parents liked me, and
that JELL-O gave me a fake phone number.

56:48.154 --> 56:51.657
Well, at least the garbage was free.
You know? I mean...

56:52.200 --> 56:55.661
Ah, who are we kidding?
We could save every city on the planet,

56:55.745 --> 56:59.289
and they'd still treat us the same way
they've always treated us...

56:59.374 --> 57:00.999
...like monsters.

57:02.502 --> 57:05.295
Right. Monsters.

57:07.006 --> 57:10.050
Anyway, how is Derek?

57:15.181 --> 57:17.766
Derek is a selfish jerk.

57:17.851 --> 57:19.351
- No!
- Yes.

57:20.395 --> 57:23.522
All that talk about "us."
"I'm so proud of us."

57:23.690 --> 57:26.733
"Us just got a job in Fresno."
There's no "us."

57:27.485 --> 57:31.655
There was only Derek. Why did I have to
get hit by a meteor to see that?

57:32.699 --> 57:33.866
I was such an idiot!

57:36.286 --> 57:39.496
Why did I ever think life with Derek
would be so great, anyway?

57:40.206 --> 57:42.666
I mean, look at all the stuff
I've done without him.

57:42.750 --> 57:46.670
Fighting an alien robot?
That was me, not him.

57:47.213 --> 57:51.884
And that was amazing!
Meeting you guys? Amazing.

57:52.635 --> 57:55.137
Dr. Cockroach, you can crawl up walls

57:55.221 --> 57:59.725
and build a supercomputer out of a
pizza box, two cans of hairspray, and...

57:59.809 --> 58:02.060
- A paper clip!
- Amazing!

58:02.145 --> 58:05.564
And you! You hardly need an
introduction. You're the Missing Link!

58:05.648 --> 58:08.567
You personally carried
250 co-eds off of Cocoa Beach,

58:08.651 --> 58:10.903
and still had strength
to fight off the National Guard!

58:10.987 --> 58:13.739
And the Coast Guard
and, also, the lifeguard.

58:13.865 --> 58:14.907
Amazing!

58:15.575 --> 58:17.534
B.O.B.! Who else could fall

58:17.619 --> 58:20.787
from unimaginable heights
and end up without a single scratch?

58:21.206 --> 58:22.831
- Link?
- You.

58:22.916 --> 58:23.999
Amazing!

58:27.295 --> 58:30.797
Good point, Insecto!
Susan, don't short-change yourself!

58:31.090 --> 58:34.885
Oh, I'm not going to
short-change myself ever again!

58:35.094 --> 58:37.346
- Testify!
- Yeah.

58:37.430 --> 58:38.639
Oh, yes.

58:44.938 --> 58:46.021
Susan!

58:53.947 --> 58:55.405
Way to go, Insecto!

59:07.418 --> 59:08.460
Insecto, look out!

59:15.468 --> 59:17.427
Insectosaurus! No!

59:25.353 --> 59:26.478
You're gonna make it.

59:27.897 --> 59:30.399
It's going to be all right. Look at me.

59:30.483 --> 59:34.111
Don't you close those eyes.
Don't you dare close those eyes.

59:35.780 --> 59:36.822
You can't...

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:18.155
You must be terrified.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:23.076
You wake up in a strange place,
wearing strange clothes,

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:28.290
imprisoned by a strange being
floating on a strange hovering device.

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.208
Strange, isn't it?

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.045
Hardly. It's not the first time.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.714
Wow. You really get around.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.675
To the extraction chamber!

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:41.762
Look. What is it that you want from me?

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:45.557
You have stolen what is rightfully mine!

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.476
I didn't steal anything from you.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.730
Your enormous, grotesque body
contains Quantonium,

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.941
the most powerful substance
in the universe.

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:58.487
Did you really think
you could keep it from me?

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:01.490
That's what this is all about?

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:06.328
You destroyed San Francisco,
you terrified millions of people...

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.081
...you killed my friend,
just to get to me?

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.961
Silence!
Your voice is grating on my ear nubs.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.676
It's a shame you won't be around to see
what the power of Quantonium

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.931
can do in the tentacles
of someone who knows how to use it!

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.433
I know how to use it just fine!

01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:33.563
Don't bother.
That force field is impenetrab...

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.108
What the Flagnard?!

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.248
That should stop your puny...

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.959
Computer, close door, hangar two!

01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:56.503
Close door, hangar three!

01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:58.797
Door, hangar four!

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:01.758
Close them all!

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:50.140
Computer, begin extraction!

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:37.562
Finally, I can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:41.316
Any thoughts on where
I should set up shop?

01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:43.443
Your planet, perhaps?

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.112
You keep your
slimy tentacles off my planet!

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:48.907
If you wanted to stop me,
you should have done it

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.992
when you possessed the Quantonium!

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.911
Now you're nothing.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.915
There are innocent people
down there who didn't do anything!

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:02.963
There were innocent people on my
home planet before it was destroyed.

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:06.174
- I'm sorry your planet was destroyed.
- Oh, don't be.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:09.094
I'm the one who destroyed it. Confused?

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:16.184
After I reveal my tale to you,
everything will become crystal clear.

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:19.896
Computer, initialize cloning machine.

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.439
Yes, Gallaxhar.

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:26.653
Many zentons ago,
when I was but a squidling,

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:29.155
I found out my parents were...

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:35.245
No child should ever
have to endure that!

01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:37.622
So I went on the road with a giant...

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.294
And soon thereafter was married!

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.589
Things were going well,
until she wanted to...

01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:51.720
And then I was all, "No way!", and she
was all, "Yes, way," and I was like...

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:56.641
But I've told you too much already!

01:04:58.644 --> 01:05:02.689
Let the birth of my new planet,
now called...

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:06.985
..."Gallaxhar's Planet" begin!

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:36.848
Once again,
a UFO has landed in America,

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:40.060
the only country UFO's
ever seem to land in.

01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:42.771
Excuse me. What's that, Henshaw?

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:45.607
Okey-dokey.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:52.322
We now take you, live, to a transmission
from the alien spacecraft.

01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:58.036
Humans of Earth, I have come in peace.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:03.041
You need not fear me.
I mean you no harm.

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:08.421
However, it is important to note most of
you will not survive the next 24 hours.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:12.634
And those who do survive will be
enslaved and experimented on.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:15.845
You should in no way
take any of this personally.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:20.392
It's just business. So just to recap:

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:25.063
I come in peace, I mean you no harm
and you all will die. Gallaxhar out.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.404
OK, boys, set the terror level

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.365
at code brown
'cause I need to change my pants.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.090
- What're we gonna do now, Doc?
- I...

01:06:53.592 --> 01:06:54.676
I don't know.

01:06:55.636 --> 01:07:00.473
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're not gonna let Insecto die in vain.

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:06.479
We're gonna get up there, find Susan,
and we're gonna take that alien down!

01:07:11.652 --> 01:07:15.155
All right, you got enough juice
in those jetpacks to get up there,

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:16.781
but not enough to make it home.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:22.412
I'll come get you if I can.
If I don't, it means I'm dead. Or late.

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:26.708
I've been your warden
for close to 50 years.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.960
That's no longer the case.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.129
For what it's worth...

01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:36.760
- That's rude. What did we do?
- No, B.O.B., that's not rude.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:39.054
That's a sign of respect.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.482
General, it's targeting us!

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.276
That's the idea, Lieutenant.
Hold your course.

01:07:53.944 --> 01:07:54.986
Steady.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.322
Steady.

01:07:58.365 --> 01:07:59.824
Hard right! Hard right!

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.662
I can't shake it!

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.002
Hang on to your socks!
We're going for a ride!

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:26.100
That's why I always
wear a parachute, Lieutenant.

01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:31.814
You can let go of me now, Lieutenant.

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:07.225
Who are you signaling?
We're right here.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.393
Hey, zip it!

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:17.359
Clone!

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.698
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- No, not all of you. You, there.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.701
How do I do this? Three back.

01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:28.246
No, no, no, no. That guy next to you.
The one I'm pointing at!

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:29.413
You! The one...

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.167
You, clone! Yes! Good!

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.337
Take the prisoner to the incinerator.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.756
She's useless to us now.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:42.510
- Hail Gallaxhar.
- Hail me.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:01.529
Wow. Ginormica ain't so...
"ginormic" anymore.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.448
How are we supposed to get to her?

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:06.326
There's too many of them.
It's impossible.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:15.418
I may not have a brain, gentlemen,
but I have an idea.

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.426
This is not going to work.

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:37.899
Halt!

01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:47.992
I... Gallaxhar, command you
to hand over the prisoner this instant.

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:51.537
Clearly, you are defective
beyond repair.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:54.749
Guards, take this defective clone
to the incinerator!

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:01.256
Well, what are you waiting for?
You and you!

01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:05.260
- Seriously?
- Yes! Take the prisoner

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:08.846
and the defective clone
to the incinerator!

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:13.309
- Of course, sir.
- Here's a security pass, just in case.

01:11:14.895 --> 01:11:17.021
- Would you like a gun?
- Yes, I would.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:18.690
Hey, guys, look.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:23.820
OK.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:28.866
I can't believe you guys
came to save me. Thank you.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:32.161
Don't mention it.
We monsters got to stick together.

01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:36.291
But I'm not a monster anymore.
I'm just me.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:40.211
My dear, no matter what your size,
you'll always be...

01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:44.215
...nothing but a filthy,
carbon-based life form!

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.175
Hail Gallaxhar!

01:11:46.593 --> 01:11:47.885
Hail Gallaxhar.

01:11:52.182 --> 01:11:54.183
These disguises are the bomb!

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.936
That's it! Follow me.

01:11:58.022 --> 01:12:00.189
- The only way to save the Earth...
- Hail Gallaxhar!

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:01.607
Hail Gallaxhar. The only way...

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.359
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- Hail Gallaxhar.

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:06.029
...to save the Earth
is to blow up this ship...

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.239
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- Hail Gallaxhar.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.326
- ...before the invasion starts.
- How are we gonna do this?

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.911
We need to find the main power core.

01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.373
Excuse me, could you direct us
to the main power core?

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:20.418
Gladly. It's right there,
above the extraction chamber.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.557
Thank you very much. Hail Gallaxhar.

01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:36.059
- Watch out!
- Look out, brainless!

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.644
Give me that thing!

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:42.106
A weapon like this needs to be
in the hands of someone responsible.

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:45.526
What?!

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.738
Hail Gallaxhar?

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:50.782
Monsters!

01:12:50.991 --> 01:12:53.493
- Monsters.
- Monsters?!

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:58.915
Attention, all aliens!
Destroy all monsters!

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.210
You want some of this?!

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:04.128
Ninja!

01:13:08.258 --> 01:13:11.677
You want to hurt my friends,
you'll have to go through me!

01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:15.473
Oh, yeah.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:38.413
Susan!

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:46.921
I can't believe we made it!

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:08.693
O... M... G.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.654
Warning: Intruder.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:16.284
You'll never figure out my color code.

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:20.204
A hexadecimal color code system.

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:22.206
This won't be but a moment.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:26.461
Red, green, blue,
yellow, orange, baby blue,

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:30.214
purple, pink, mauve, gold,
brown, mocha, avocado, adobe gold!

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:39.223
Doc, come on, dance!

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:44.562
Your busted, tired dance moves
are no match for my security protocols.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:48.983
- We can't hold them off much longer!
- One thing you don't know about me!

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:52.570
My Ph.D... is in...

01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:56.240
...dance! Dance! Dance!

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.243
Security protocol breached.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.914
Ship has been set to self-destruct.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:07.627
Total annihilation
in T-minus six minutes.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:12.089
- Well, launch the invasion then!
- Invasion no longer possible.

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:14.550
Oh, space balls!

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:19.055
Divert the Quantonium to the bridge,
and prepare my escape capsule!

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.073
Look at that! They're all
running scared! Monsters win!

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.784
I don't think
that's why they're running.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:44.372
Ship will self-destruct
in T-minus five minutes.

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:48.793
Hail Gallaxhar!

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:51.045
We're not gonna make it!

01:15:58.679 --> 01:15:59.804
Hang on!

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:07.979
Keep going!

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.991
It's no use. It won't budge.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:23.286
If I was still Ginormica,
I could do this!

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.663
Get out of here
while you still got the chance!

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:29.417
No! Don't say that.
I'm not leaving you guys.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.919
Yes, you are.
Rendezvous with Monger.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.923
He's outside the ship, waiting for you.
Go while there's still time.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:41.053
Ship will self-destruct
in T-minus four minutes.

01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:42.847
Don't you worry about us, Susan.

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.558
You finally have a chance
to get your old life back.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.311
I don't want my old life back.

01:16:56.528 --> 01:16:58.404
They think they've stopped me?!

01:16:58.488 --> 01:17:00.698
They've stopped nothing.

01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:05.077
Female carbon-based life form,
or Susan, not contained.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:06.370
What?!

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:17.423
Attention, robot probes!
Crush the earthling!

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.704
Robot bay has been destroyed.

01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:51.666
Fire phasoid cannon!

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:17.483
Are you crazy?!
You could have killed me!

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:19.527
Then we understand each other.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.988
Now, open the doors
and let my friends go.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.365
Or what?

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:28.077
You don't actually think
you're a match for me, do you?

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:34.667
Quantonium has been
successfully diverted to the bridge.

01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:37.878
Escape capsule ready for transport.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.215
Like I told you before,
you should have defeated me

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.467
when you had the Quantonium.

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:46.387
Have fun exploding!

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:16.584
- Now open the doors.
- Even if I wanted to, I couldn't!

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:19.795
That's what happens
when you set a ship to self-destruct!

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.006
Now we're all going to die!

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:25.551
And there's nothing
you can do about it, Susan!

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.430
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:19:29.973 --> 01:19:32.141
And the name is Ginormica.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:49.533
Total annihilation
in T-minus one minute.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:52.870
- It's been an honor knowing you, Doc.
- The feeling's mutual.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:55.748
I'll see you guys tomorrow for lunch.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:57.041
That's right, B.O.B.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:20:00.044
And there'll be candy
and cake and balloons.

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:05.382
Cake and balloons for lunch?! It's gonna
be the best day ever! I love you guys!

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.648
By Hawking's chair!

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:44.547
Total annihilation
in T-minus 30 seconds.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.593
- Where's Monger?!
- He's supposed to be here!

01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:53.430
He said the only reason he wouldn't
be here is if he was dead!

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:58.185
Or late!

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:05.109
Insectosaurus?! You're alive!

01:21:06.152 --> 01:21:08.612
And you're a... butterfly!

01:21:13.493 --> 01:21:14.535
Eight...

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.161
...seven...

01:21:16.746 --> 01:21:17.788
...six...

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:19.623
...five...

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.417
...four...

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:24.795
- ...three... two...
- Come on, come on!

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.255
...one.

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:31.510
Nothing happened. Maybe my count was...

01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:39.977
There they are!

01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:42.438
Here they come!

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:58.662
Yeah!

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:01.957
Oh, great.

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:06.879
Oh, boy.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:10.841
- Susie Q!
- Daddy!

01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:15.804
Oh, Susan. Ever since you were a baby,
I knew that someday...

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:20.225
...you would, you know, save the Earth
from an invasion from outer space.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:23.187
Thank you, but it wasn't just me, Mom.

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:26.023
Excuse me! Hello!
Coming through! How are you?

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.984
- Susan!
- Derek?

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:32.404
Baby, I thought long and hard
about what happened between us.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.114
And I want you to know...

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.158
...I forgive you.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.661
You forgive me?

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:42.748
Of course. It wasn't your fault you got
hit by a meteor and ruined everything.

01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:43.916
And you know what?

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:48.253
I say maybe you didn't ruin everything.
I just got a call from New York.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:51.465
They offered me network.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.551
All I have to do is get
an exclusive interview from you.

01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:56.637
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:56.721 --> 01:22:59.723
I get my dream job
and you get your dream guy.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.559
It's a win-win for Team Dietl.

01:23:03.853 --> 01:23:04.895
Derek...

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:07.439
...that's amazing.

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.318
- Is the camera rolling?
- Absolutely.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.906
Good. Because I wouldn't want
your fans to miss this.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.159
This is Susan Murphy, saying,

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:22.579
"Goodbye, Derek!"

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:27.459
B.O.B., could you...?

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:36.927
Derek, you are a selfish jerk,
and guess what?

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.805
I've met someone else.
She's lime green.

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:43.017
She has 14 little chunks
of pineapple inside her,

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:46.353
and she's everything
I deserve in life!

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:49.023
I'm happy now, Derek, without you!

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:50.941
It's over!

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:54.278
Turn it off.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:57.114
Monsters, I'm so proud of you,
I could cry,

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.658
if I hadn't lost my tear ducts
in the war.

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:03.120
But not crying will have to wait.
The world needs you again.

01:24:03.663 --> 01:24:04.913
What is it, General?

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:08.042
Seems a snail fell into
a French nuclear reactor.

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:11.462
As we speak, Escargantua

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:15.132
is slowly making its way to Paris.

01:24:16.342 --> 01:24:20.220
Well, I've always wanted to go to Paris.
Now who's with me?

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:23.015
What do you say, Butterfly... osaurus?

01:24:25.101 --> 01:24:26.143
We're in.

01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:28.395
- I'm in!
- Count me in, too.

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:35.986
Au revoir, sweetie!

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.823
- Have a safe flight!
- Yeah, and hang on!

01:24:52.962 --> 01:24:56.173
Goodbye, Derek!
Good luck getting over me.

01:24:56.841 --> 01:25:00.135
B.O.B., it's me
he's never going to get over.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.555
Wait, wait! You were dating Derek too?!

01:25:04.849 --> 01:25:06.475
That two-timing jerk!

01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:42.362
Everyone, let's welcome my new chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

01:26:42.488 --> 01:26:44.656
General W.R. Monger!

01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:49.161
Thank you, Mr. President. What a
great way to celebrate my 90th birthday.

01:26:49.412 --> 01:26:51.121
Very good, Warren. All right.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.249
Let's get it started in here
Nerd?

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:58.253
Gentlemen, I have assembled
a preliminary budget estimate

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:00.464
for the rebuilding of San Francisco.

01:27:00.548 --> 01:27:02.716
Zoinkers. This is going
to be a boring one.

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:06.553
Good time for a cup of joe.
Warren, how do you take it?

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:09.431
Hit me with a double venti
organic chocolate brownie

01:27:09.515 --> 01:27:12.517
caramel Frappuccino, extra hot,
with one inch of foam...

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:15.604
- ...non-fat.
- You got it! Black it is.

01:27:15.688 --> 01:27:16.772
Don't do it!

01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:17.898
Wait!

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:20.901
My God, man! What have you done?!

01:27:22.153 --> 01:27:24.738
Time to wave the white flag
and head for the bunker.

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:27.324
Let's check on the situation
in 500 years.

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:28.951
Who wants to freeze my head?

01:27:29.305 --> 01:27:35.526
