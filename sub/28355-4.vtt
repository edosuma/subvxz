00:00.016 --> 00:01.835
Previously on Cloak and Dagger...

00:01.859 --> 00:03.937
You just embarrassed
the Uptown Block Kings,

00:03.963 --> 00:06.138
which stands to make them
more paranoid, and dangerous.

00:06.163 --> 00:07.515
But I'm not out of trouble, am I?

00:07.540 --> 00:09.703
With Connors MIA, there's
not enough to exonerate you.

00:09.727 --> 00:11.387
You have any idea where he could be?

00:11.411 --> 00:13.996
- Someone has to be looking for them.
- Someone is.

00:14.021 --> 00:16.242
- These folks right here.
- Who are you?

00:16.267 --> 00:18.344
I'm the one who's gonna
find those missing girls.

00:18.398 --> 00:21.123
After I was shot, I divided into two?

00:21.148 --> 00:22.224
What is all this?

00:22.249 --> 00:23.529
This is Mayhem.

00:23.928 --> 00:25.885
The next place she'd go is Pier 81.

00:37.798 --> 00:39.584
Who's up for awkward reunion pancakes?

00:46.741 --> 00:51.839
What was that?

00:53.929 --> 00:55.304
I don't know.

00:55.329 --> 00:57.942
- You don't know? How could you not know?
- I don't know!

00:57.960 --> 01:00.854
Okay, well, then... where did she go?

01:01.659 --> 01:04.188
- How am I supposed to know?
- Because she went inside you.

01:04.214 --> 01:06.971
She didn't go inside me... okay?

01:06.996 --> 01:08.681
I-I don't think so,
that's not how it felt.

01:09.672 --> 01:10.810
What did it feel like?

01:14.858 --> 01:17.583
It felt like she was...
being sucked through me,

01:17.608 --> 01:19.419
and then put onto somewhere else.

01:19.444 --> 01:20.604
And why do you think that?

01:25.392 --> 01:26.994
'Cause it happened once before...

01:27.018 --> 01:28.938
- Ty, what the hell are you talking...
- Connors.

01:32.618 --> 01:33.858
It took Connors.

01:37.112 --> 01:38.644
That night on the roof?

01:44.920 --> 01:46.673
Hey, you girls wait in this room, okay?

01:55.585 --> 01:56.984
Ty, that was months ago!

01:57.009 --> 01:59.090
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Look, I didn't know how to.

01:59.114 --> 02:00.380
You've been living here.

02:00.405 --> 02:02.054
Like this, for months.

02:02.189 --> 02:05.064
You said without Connors,
they couldn't clear you on anything.

02:05.089 --> 02:08.077
- You don't have to tell me...
- Kinda feels like I do, Ty.

02:08.154 --> 02:12.251
You've been posting up this
excuse to avoid life... Evita.

02:12.276 --> 02:14.518
Your parents, and this
whole time, you could've...

02:14.543 --> 02:16.001
I could've what?

02:16.262 --> 02:18.467
If I could bring him back,
I would, but I can't.

02:21.901 --> 02:22.953
Look, I want to go home.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.642
I want my life back, you know that.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.623
But... but it's not like I can just...

02:28.295 --> 02:29.828
just step into myself.

02:34.728 --> 02:35.769
Maybe I could do it.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.309
Two people enter.

02:41.224 --> 02:43.567
- One... also enters.
- That's not how it works.

02:43.592 --> 02:44.942
Then, how does it work?

02:45.675 --> 02:46.755
Name?

02:47.122 --> 02:49.278
We know you Kings were
holdin' those girls.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.743
You wanna tell us
where they were heading?

02:58.353 --> 03:00.113
Yo, don't I get a phone call?

03:07.509 --> 03:10.638
- How did it go down with Connors?
- He pulled a gun on me,

03:10.716 --> 03:13.116
and it protected me again, but...

03:14.494 --> 03:16.525
This time...

03:18.499 --> 03:20.259
- ... whoosh.
- Yeah...

03:22.610 --> 03:23.788
Okay.

03:24.596 --> 03:26.576
That's exactly how
it went with her, too.

03:26.601 --> 03:30.495
She... she shot up the whole
place, and then... whoosh.

03:33.788 --> 03:36.039
I need to go in and get to her, Ty.

03:36.064 --> 03:37.267
We only found them because

03:37.292 --> 03:39.251
she knew where to find
them, and she still does.

03:39.562 --> 03:41.188
You saw what they were
doing to those girls.

03:41.212 --> 03:43.370
Yeah, and, I also saw what she
did to everything in her path.

03:43.394 --> 03:45.087
I got a girl caught up in this.

03:46.736 --> 03:48.884
And I can't unsee what I saw, can you?

03:48.909 --> 03:50.351
No, I can't.

03:50.353 --> 03:51.861
Just...

03:53.377 --> 03:54.929
maybe shit needs to go boom again.

03:54.954 --> 03:56.960
Shit needs to go bigger than boom.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.785
You need to be afraid for your life.

04:01.656 --> 04:02.914
Okay.

04:09.359 --> 04:10.775
Make me afraid.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.623
Boy that blew up our action last night?

04:23.645 --> 04:24.645
I got a name.

04:28.205 --> 04:29.549
"Tyrone Johnson."

04:39.036 --> 04:42.739
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly </font>-
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

04:43.306 --> 04:44.941
Hey.

04:44.965 --> 04:47.365
I need a unit to double back
to the truck stop to check on...

04:51.548 --> 04:52.548
Excuse me.

04:54.954 --> 04:56.406
Take her.

04:56.431 --> 04:59.265
- What the hell is going on?!
- We're processing her.

04:59.290 --> 05:02.448
- Why? She's the victim.
- Prostitution is still a crime.

05:03.425 --> 05:05.783
If she flips on these guys
we'll drop the charges.

05:05.808 --> 05:07.990
If she flips on these guys,
they'll kill her.

05:08.338 --> 05:11.148
They're far more scary to
her than you... no offense.

05:13.441 --> 05:15.568
This is a hell of a collar, Detective.

05:16.014 --> 05:18.481
But do not confuse it for your case.

05:18.941 --> 05:20.969
You're a guest in the Bywater House,

05:20.994 --> 05:22.872
and you're wearing
out the welcome mat...

05:23.621 --> 05:25.221
"no offense."

05:49.056 --> 05:50.569
What if I'm not afraid of you?

05:55.155 --> 05:56.797
You always have been on some level.

05:58.023 --> 05:59.277
No.

05:59.302 --> 06:01.514
I'm probably the only person
on Earth who knows the real you.

06:01.538 --> 06:02.904
You know what I've been through.

06:03.021 --> 06:05.512
What I'm capable of,
but that goes both ways.

06:06.605 --> 06:07.965
I see your darkness, too.

06:08.665 --> 06:10.338
Why didn't you tell me about Connors?

06:10.363 --> 06:13.301
We were in the middle of
saving the world at the time.

06:13.325 --> 06:16.207
Yeah, and then, we
weren't, for a long time.

06:16.232 --> 06:19.254
And you were hangin' on tight
to this piece of driftwood... why?

06:19.850 --> 06:21.740
- I don't know.
- I think you do know.

06:22.876 --> 06:25.662
What's goin' on with your
equally traumatized heart, Ty?

06:26.882 --> 06:29.030
- I don't know.
- If it were me,

06:29.063 --> 06:31.703
I would bring him back and I would
end him, right here on the spot.

06:32.147 --> 06:33.748
How's that for a scary thought?

06:34.048 --> 06:35.432
It's not that simple.

06:36.297 --> 06:37.781
And your parents.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.681
They're separated.

06:39.706 --> 06:41.096
From each other. From you.

06:41.927 --> 06:44.159
Don't you want a whole family again?

06:44.184 --> 06:45.206
Of course I do.

06:45.231 --> 06:47.448
Then why on Earth would
you not pull him...

06:47.473 --> 06:49.089
'Cause what if I can't protect them?!

06:49.702 --> 06:51.342
What if they die, just like Billy?

06:55.702 --> 06:58.062
What if I pull him out and I'm
not brave enough to stop him?

06:58.577 --> 07:01.950
To end him. Again.

07:03.444 --> 07:06.178
- Just the thought of that...
- Terrifies you.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.185
We're gonna talk about
this when you get back.

07:13.209 --> 07:14.670
Assuming I get back.

07:14.695 --> 07:15.935
You got this.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.516
Go get her.

07:20.850 --> 07:21.910
And be careful.

07:27.688 --> 07:29.347
Tandy?

07:31.454 --> 07:32.862
Hey, can you hear me?

07:39.605 --> 07:40.779
Ty?

07:42.729 --> 07:44.700
Hello? Can you hear me?

08:26.852 --> 08:28.913
Hey... hey, Brigid, you okay?

08:29.233 --> 08:30.556
Did you take the girls to the, uh...

08:30.580 --> 08:32.197
They're with me at the
Bywater Station House.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.640
But we have bigger problems.

08:34.065 --> 08:35.493
It's the Uptown Block Kings.

08:35.518 --> 08:38.501
- They saw your "Wanted" poster at booking.
- Okay, well,

08:38.525 --> 08:40.149
they don't know about the church, right?

08:40.174 --> 08:42.657
No, but you do have
an address on record.

08:45.517 --> 08:46.614
Shit.

09:30.664 --> 09:32.423
Don't even think about...

09:32.448 --> 09:34.098
- Mom...
- Tyrone?!

09:34.123 --> 09:36.562
- Ma, it's me.
- Oh, my God...

09:37.579 --> 09:39.062
Oh, my God!

09:39.358 --> 09:40.566
Ty!

09:46.774 --> 09:49.074
I'm sorry I scared you.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.586
Where did you go?

10:05.280 --> 10:06.560
Because of course you are...

10:11.440 --> 10:12.440
What the... ?

10:21.890 --> 10:22.890
Here you are.

10:24.672 --> 10:25.672
So, what're you here for?

10:31.602 --> 10:34.242
- Are you all right?
- I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

10:34.641 --> 10:36.083
- What about you?
- I don't know.

10:36.961 --> 10:39.353
I-I walked through this
"door" that my friend made.

10:40.343 --> 10:41.354
Tyrone.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.531
Your Divine Pairing.

10:43.078 --> 10:44.566
So, you... so you get that channel?

10:45.210 --> 10:47.569
- We get all the channels.
- So, that means you're not...

10:47.920 --> 10:50.319
- really fun-sized Tyrone.
- Nope.

10:52.429 --> 10:53.703
So, what's your name?

10:53.728 --> 10:54.949
I have too many.

10:55.395 --> 10:57.578
I am that which stands
at the crossroads.

10:58.051 --> 10:59.902
St. Peter... Atibon...

11:00.826 --> 11:01.893
Papa Legba.

11:03.733 --> 11:04.860
Okay.

11:05.237 --> 11:08.212
Well, uh, Papa... um...

11:08.892 --> 11:12.255
I walked through this door because
someone came in before I did.

11:13.029 --> 11:15.826
A woman, she was bleeding,
and I followed the blood here.

11:16.302 --> 11:17.612
She's wearing a green jacket.

11:17.637 --> 11:18.837
Have you... have you seen her?

11:19.339 --> 11:21.987
I've seen blood... and a green jacket.

11:22.343 --> 11:24.495
- But it was worn by half a woman.
- Yeah.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.108
Okay, the, uh, the scary
half, though, right?

11:27.734 --> 11:30.806
- Do you know where she went?
- What do you want from her?

11:32.621 --> 11:34.056
I just... need to pull her out,

11:34.081 --> 11:35.783
so she can help me find some bad people.

11:36.517 --> 11:37.827
Maybe save some lives.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.553
Is that all you want from her?

11:41.991 --> 11:43.111
Absolutely.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.035
She's not gonna be able
to leave on her own.

11:45.060 --> 11:46.859
You're gonna have
to take her out with you.

11:46.884 --> 11:48.354
So there is a way out?

11:48.379 --> 11:49.714
The only way out is through.

11:50.726 --> 11:51.966
Through what?

11:52.074 --> 11:53.699
Through the gauntlet of transactions.

11:56.876 --> 11:58.435
What, are you just walkin'
around with a gun now?

11:58.459 --> 12:00.293
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be in New Orleans.

12:00.317 --> 12:02.002
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Mom. Mom, look.

12:02.026 --> 12:03.379
- What happened?
- I need you to listen to me, okay?

12:03.403 --> 12:05.012
- Are you okay?
- We gotta get out of here.

12:05.036 --> 12:06.056
What are you talking about?

12:06.080 --> 12:07.932
I messed with the wrong
guys, the got my name.

12:07.957 --> 12:10.238
They might have this address,
so we gotta get out of here.

12:11.178 --> 12:13.232
- So, they might be heading over here?
- Yes.

12:13.604 --> 12:14.762
Oh, Tyrone...

12:17.117 --> 12:18.368
Wh... Mom!

12:21.033 --> 12:22.437
I don't see anything.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.466
You have to pay to play.

12:26.424 --> 12:27.611
"Let go"?

12:28.240 --> 12:29.275
Pay to play.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.527
Give it up, and go on.

12:30.870 --> 12:32.390
You'll have it whenever you want it.

12:33.316 --> 12:35.023
Just know, if you take it out in there,

12:35.047 --> 12:36.112
the journey's over.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.888
"Give it up"?

12:46.931 --> 12:48.197
Give this up?

12:51.774 --> 12:53.964
- What is all this?
- Don't worry about that stuff.

12:53.989 --> 12:55.978
- Look, Mom, we gotta go now!
- I heard you.

12:56.003 --> 12:57.163
I just need a minute.

12:57.523 --> 13:00.809
So, head into uncertain doom without
the only thing that keeps me safe?

13:01.015 --> 13:02.145
It's not the only thing.

13:06.467 --> 13:07.809
Mom... Mom!

13:07.834 --> 13:08.974
Mom, we gotta go!

13:08.999 --> 13:10.099
Now!

13:11.261 --> 13:12.354
Okay.

13:24.010 --> 13:25.901
- What's this?
- Your receipt.

13:26.696 --> 13:28.260
Why does it have this on it?

13:28.845 --> 13:30.651
Every coin has two sides to it.

13:35.646 --> 13:38.132
Come on, come on! Look, now, hold on.

13:38.707 --> 13:40.047
Look, I know this is gonna seem weird,

13:40.071 --> 13:41.124
but I promise it's safe.

13:41.149 --> 13:42.347
Okay?

13:45.616 --> 13:46.990
Wait, so the other side means...

13:56.020 --> 13:57.069
What are you doing?!

13:59.539 --> 14:00.723
We gotta go!

14:13.428 --> 14:14.943
- Ty, you okay?
- Yeah.

14:20.282 --> 14:21.607
Why isn't this working?!

14:45.479 --> 14:46.721
Get in, get in!

14:53.742 --> 14:55.057
How do you even know how to do that?

14:56.106 --> 14:57.626
Some things you never forget.

15:02.351 --> 15:03.406
Damn!

15:13.073 --> 15:14.793
Hello... ?

15:18.220 --> 15:19.740
Hello, is anybody here?!

15:41.843 --> 15:43.385
What the hell are you doing here?

15:57.359 --> 15:59.187
Why aren't you pulling
out one of your little...

15:59.211 --> 16:01.139
They only come out when I'm afraid.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.483
Why are you here?

16:04.508 --> 16:07.017
I need to know what you know
about what happened to those girls.

16:07.041 --> 16:09.077
I offered you a team-up,
and you said no.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.937
So, now, just stay out of my face
until I can find my way out of here.

16:14.685 --> 16:16.285
That's the thing, though...

16:17.124 --> 16:18.803
Papa Mystery over at the gas station

16:18.828 --> 16:20.286
said you're only a half person,

16:20.311 --> 16:21.888
and that you can't get out on your own.

16:22.241 --> 16:23.335
You talked to him, too?

16:23.360 --> 16:24.412
Fuchs?

16:24.437 --> 16:25.467
I talked to Ty.

16:25.965 --> 16:28.015
But it... it wasn't Ty.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.524
It wasn't Fuchs, either.

16:29.903 --> 16:31.525
So, I pissed off, and found my way here.

16:31.916 --> 16:33.629
He said if you want to get outta here,

16:34.617 --> 16:36.077
you're gonna have to do it with me.

16:36.873 --> 16:38.192
Good luck, Princess.

16:38.217 --> 16:41.060
I've given this place a once over
six times, and best I can tell,

16:41.631 --> 16:42.631
there's no way out.

16:51.071 --> 16:52.311
Mrs. Johnson?

16:56.594 --> 16:57.991
Ty?

17:11.673 --> 17:12.760
Detective?

17:12.785 --> 17:15.135
- Alarm went off at this place.
- Yeah, I heard the same thing.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.383
Um... this is...

17:16.913 --> 17:19.290
- was... Tyrone Johnson's house.
- The cop killer?

17:20.742 --> 17:21.904
I better call in a BOLO.

17:22.564 --> 17:25.298
- All units be on the lookout for Tyrone Johnson.
- Makes sense...

17:25.323 --> 17:27.604
We have reason
to believe he's in the area.

17:34.526 --> 17:35.700
Who were those men?

17:35.725 --> 17:37.761
They call themselves
the Uptown Block Kings.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.366
They run drugs, guns, girls

17:40.391 --> 17:42.896
- around and about the Bywater.
- How did you get thrown in with them?

17:42.920 --> 17:44.240
I didn't get thrown in with them.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.271
Was actually throwin' down with this...

17:46.295 --> 17:48.813
What're you even doing in the city?
The police are looking for you.

17:48.837 --> 17:51.172
You should be literally anywhere else.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.626
Why would you stay here?

17:54.438 --> 17:55.977
'Cause this is home.

17:56.002 --> 17:57.533
It's a miracle you're still alive.

17:58.305 --> 18:00.969
- I know.
- I thought I raised you smarter.

18:05.894 --> 18:07.110
Get ready to go.

18:07.135 --> 18:08.266
But, go where?

18:09.211 --> 18:10.540
Right there. See?

18:11.201 --> 18:13.126
- Seems simple enough.
- Right?

18:13.414 --> 18:15.586
Except there is no there, there.

18:16.408 --> 18:17.547
I've been here for hours,

18:17.572 --> 18:19.601
and the mall ends at those mirrors.

18:21.019 --> 18:23.250
Curiouser and curiouser.

18:24.576 --> 18:26.888
Look, there's nothing in these mirrors,

18:27.304 --> 18:28.984
which is weird for mirrors, right?

18:36.093 --> 18:37.405
Or not...

18:38.433 --> 18:39.741
What's wrong with your side?

18:40.102 --> 18:42.616
- Why can't we see you?
- Maybe Papa Mystery was right.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.940
I do need you to get through.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.983
Only question is...

18:47.614 --> 18:48.691
which you?

19:39.208 --> 19:42.359
- What?
- You look exactly like her.

19:42.563 --> 19:44.794
Why not "she looks exactly like you"?

19:44.819 --> 19:46.669
Because she's Brigid.

19:46.694 --> 19:47.780
And what does that make me?

19:48.279 --> 19:49.514
You're the toxic side.

19:50.310 --> 19:52.027
The pain, the anger, the...

19:52.503 --> 19:53.639
The what?

19:53.664 --> 19:54.930
Mayhem?

19:54.955 --> 19:56.236
Nothing wrong with a little mayhem.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.165
It's one way to shake up the status quo.

19:58.190 --> 20:00.093
Sometimes, the status quo is okay.

20:00.118 --> 20:03.279
And sometimes, girls are
stolen and sold into slavery.

20:03.304 --> 20:05.705
Oh, wait... that's all the time.

20:17.470 --> 20:18.929
This way. Come on.

20:19.366 --> 20:21.365
You don't need to pull me,
Mom, I'm not a child.

20:21.390 --> 20:24.209
Then stop acting like a child.
Keep your voice down.

20:27.739 --> 20:30.293
Hey! You two, there!

20:31.632 --> 20:32.872
Come on, this way.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.310
What were those papers?

21:06.335 --> 21:08.161
The ones on the dining
room table you were hiding?

21:08.185 --> 21:10.647
- Nothing.
- I'm not a kid anymore, Mom.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.908
In your absence, I've been
doin' what I can to get you home.

21:17.251 --> 21:18.317
Safe.

21:19.030 --> 21:20.695
- And cleared.
- It's not possible.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.217
Not without Detective Connors.

21:23.242 --> 21:25.734
He's my only way back into
any kind of a life again.

21:26.538 --> 21:27.696
How do you know that?

21:29.661 --> 21:31.460
I'm not a kid anymore, Mom.

21:32.426 --> 21:34.410
And what do you mean "doin' what I can"?

21:34.435 --> 21:35.646
You can't get in trouble, too.

21:36.932 --> 21:38.832
I haven't been a kid in a long time.

21:48.948 --> 21:51.196
Mom... Mom, we can't stay here.

21:51.830 --> 21:52.889
Come on.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.710
Follow me...

22:05.160 --> 22:06.235
now!

22:13.590 --> 22:15.274
Go to the mall a lot
when you were a kid?

22:15.694 --> 22:17.314
Stopped being a kid early.

22:17.464 --> 22:18.905
I used to go every other day.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.831
- Obligatory movie, occasional manicure...
- Seems like fun.

22:24.162 --> 22:25.570
Why are we stopping?

22:25.572 --> 22:27.380
'Cause this is different.

22:37.929 --> 22:39.369
Someone's been living here.

22:43.874 --> 22:45.634
For months, from the looks of it.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.844
- You know who this reminds me of?
- I do.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.459
Whoever did this was scared of your boy.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.185
I knew someone who was scared.

23:10.828 --> 23:11.845
And scarred.

23:12.727 --> 23:14.486
Went missing months ago.

23:14.511 --> 23:15.885
Who's that?

23:15.910 --> 23:17.071
You know who.

23:18.085 --> 23:20.043
And the fact that you
pretend you don't know,

23:20.068 --> 23:21.668
suggests that you do
know "you know who".

23:23.656 --> 23:25.156
Do you wanna get out of here, or not?

23:31.235 --> 23:33.454
- I don't even know where we are.
- I do.

23:34.306 --> 23:35.431
Here, we can go in here.

23:35.804 --> 23:37.628
- Nobody's gonna come in here.
- How do you know?

23:37.652 --> 23:40.598
Um, because it's haunted by
300-year old vampire nuns.

23:50.854 --> 23:52.294
Is this where he's been this whole time?

23:52.318 --> 23:53.437
How should I know?

23:53.462 --> 23:55.532
You know what he did, right? To Fuchs?

23:55.557 --> 23:58.706
I do, but I also know
that Ty needs Connors alive

23:58.731 --> 24:00.183
if he's ever gonna get his life back.

24:00.207 --> 24:01.652
Here I was, thinking
that you were a warrior...

24:01.676 --> 24:03.268
I am, but when it comes to Ty...

24:03.293 --> 24:05.605
When it comes to men, they've
have their own power structure,

24:05.629 --> 24:07.479
and they do not need
your help propping it up.

24:09.189 --> 24:10.245
What's wrong?

24:11.320 --> 24:12.400
This is different, too.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.420
What the hell?!

24:35.482 --> 24:37.099
Look at the pictures on these records.

24:38.286 --> 24:40.006
And the names on the dividers.

24:45.213 --> 24:48.802
I know a lot of these names.
A lot of these faces.

24:56.303 --> 24:57.773
These are our missing girls.

25:11.294 --> 25:12.644
What is this place?

25:12.841 --> 25:14.349
It's the Clemence Convent.

25:18.928 --> 25:21.428
Tell me about these vampires nuns.

25:23.883 --> 25:26.124
When New Orleans was still
an up and coming trading port,

25:27.122 --> 25:30.926
France sent women to, uh,
help populate the city.

25:31.958 --> 25:33.718
These girls would travel
across the Atlantic,

25:34.709 --> 25:36.862
unknowingly being sent
into the arms of...

25:37.026 --> 25:38.762
vagrants... and thieves.

25:41.648 --> 25:44.267
Usually never to be heard
from by their families again.

25:44.690 --> 25:47.225
Louisiana is no stranger
to sex trafficking.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.933
All the major highways
nearby keep the blood pumping.

25:51.679 --> 25:53.410
Lots of migrants taken advantage of.

25:54.617 --> 25:57.261
But this recent rash
of disappearances was different.

25:57.877 --> 26:01.024
I noticed that more and more girls
were missing from the city proper.

26:01.049 --> 26:02.860
Legend has it that the King of France

26:02.885 --> 26:05.505
hand-picked these group of girls
known as the "Casquette Women".

26:06.137 --> 26:09.146
Each one traveled with
their casket-shaped box.

26:09.732 --> 26:11.941
Many of the girls in here
were lost to begin with,

26:11.966 --> 26:14.020
for one reason or another.

26:14.022 --> 26:16.027
Selected, I'd wager, because...

26:16.923 --> 26:18.183
they would not be missed.

26:19.589 --> 26:20.879
Like Mikayla.

26:20.904 --> 26:22.342
The transatlantic voyage was rough.

26:22.366 --> 26:24.455
It chapped their skin,

26:25.366 --> 26:26.552
ruined their hair,

26:26.577 --> 26:29.303
makin' 'em grotesque to the men
tasked with selling 'em.

26:30.092 --> 26:31.684
However these girls were selected,

26:32.503 --> 26:34.065
they were lifted without a trace.

26:34.550 --> 26:36.181
Put in those ambulances and moved

26:36.206 --> 26:38.127
without anyone ever seeing them go.

26:38.129 --> 26:40.477
Their appearance was so unsightly

26:40.502 --> 26:42.942
that they were sneaked into the city
under the cover of night.

26:44.087 --> 26:47.156
And, uh, hidden in the attic

26:47.181 --> 26:49.581
of the convent here.

26:49.658 --> 26:52.516
But I still don't know who's
paying for the ambulances.

26:53.269 --> 26:55.222
Or what the rhyme or
reason of their routes are.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.846
The next day, a horse drawn carriage

26:57.871 --> 27:02.697
slowly pulled two dozen caskets
from the dock...

27:02.722 --> 27:05.282
into the convent here with no
explanation as to what was in them.

27:06.675 --> 27:07.682
And...

27:09.728 --> 27:12.321
the legend of the Clemence
vampires was born.

27:12.346 --> 27:14.932
Whatever we're looking for,
whatever monster this is...

27:16.032 --> 27:17.793
it must have something
to do with this place.

27:18.299 --> 27:20.396
This city is full of monsters.

27:20.783 --> 27:22.823
Hell, some have even set up camp here.

27:24.271 --> 27:25.511
But this is a different breed.

27:27.406 --> 27:28.703
I mean, what kind of monster

27:28.728 --> 27:31.258
needs to keep all this pain
catalogued in one place?

27:32.259 --> 27:33.675
It's a pretty good question.

27:41.404 --> 27:42.917
But I've got a better one.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.385
- What?
- Where'd you learn that story, anyway?

27:51.410 --> 27:52.646
About... about the girls?

27:53.568 --> 27:54.679
A friend.

27:55.557 --> 27:56.775
She told me about it.

27:57.661 --> 27:58.924
Does your friend have a name?

28:01.698 --> 28:03.074
Evita.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.491
It wasn't that blonde girl who
showed up at the door last year?

28:05.515 --> 28:08.355
- No, no, no. That's... that's Tandy.
- Yeah, okay.

28:08.380 --> 28:09.534
Yeah, I don't like that one.

28:10.677 --> 28:14.231
D'you know my ID badge went
missing after her little visit?

28:14.918 --> 28:16.869
- Maybe you just lost your badge.
- Mm-mm.

28:19.168 --> 28:21.462
No, somethin' wrong with that girl.

28:22.183 --> 28:23.479
Tandy's just...

28:24.886 --> 28:26.502
Tandy's just complicated.

28:29.698 --> 28:31.379
What the hell do you think this is?

28:32.836 --> 28:34.153
It's my life.

28:34.985 --> 28:36.427
The crappy parts anyway.

28:39.528 --> 28:41.091
I can see people's hopes.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.692
These seem like they're parts of, um...

28:44.778 --> 28:45.834
when hope was...

28:48.290 --> 28:49.456
wanting.

28:49.481 --> 28:51.762
What's the word for "lack of hope"?

28:55.162 --> 28:56.898
Why are those still shrink wrapped?

28:57.966 --> 28:59.148
I don't know...

29:03.957 --> 29:05.197
Let's find out.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.630
So, this Evita... how does
she know so much about vampires?

29:21.435 --> 29:23.136
Yeah, her family owns...

29:23.161 --> 29:24.901
one of those Voodoo
shops in the quarter.

29:26.339 --> 29:27.859
She does those tours. You know?

29:28.374 --> 29:30.340
Yeah, I know... I've never been on one.

29:32.674 --> 29:33.924
How many have you been on?

29:37.077 --> 29:38.418
Eh, don't worry about that.

29:38.450 --> 29:40.593
A mother needs to worry about that.

29:45.536 --> 29:46.949
Yo, I got 'em.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.507
There's a pumped
bottle in the crisper drawer.

30:43.531 --> 30:45.678
And there's some formula behind
it, in case she's still hungry.

30:45.702 --> 30:48.845
Sweetheart, I have a half a day
of work to catch up on.

30:49.592 --> 30:50.599
You had that last night.

30:50.623 --> 30:53.741
And I gave you a break... another break.

30:53.818 --> 30:55.934
I have, God, a year
of sleep to catch up on.

30:55.959 --> 30:58.052
This is not a competition.

30:58.077 --> 31:00.717
Well, it certainly doesn't
feel like a team sport, either.

31:00.941 --> 31:02.281
Watch how you talk to me.

31:02.306 --> 31:06.370
Do you understand the pressure
that Roxxon has me under? Do you?

31:06.489 --> 31:08.881
Listen to me, I-I have deadlines.

31:08.906 --> 31:10.367
No, look at me!

31:20.748 --> 31:22.164
Enough of that noise.

31:36.018 --> 31:37.258
You really gonna do this to me?

31:38.412 --> 31:40.404
- I got a code.
- I saved your life.

31:41.209 --> 31:43.559
Where in that code does it
say hold a gun to my mother?

31:43.637 --> 31:46.269
You don't understand.
I hear the way you guys talk.

31:46.294 --> 31:48.178
- You from uptown.
- That don't matter.

31:48.877 --> 31:50.297
It shouldn't matter, but it does.

31:53.408 --> 31:55.024
No, you don't worry about her.

31:55.228 --> 31:56.606
You look at me, I know you.

31:56.631 --> 31:58.792
I see you... I saved...

31:58.868 --> 32:00.144
your life.

32:03.894 --> 32:04.908
Son...

32:04.933 --> 32:06.934
- I'm not your son.
- You're somebody's son.

32:08.229 --> 32:09.349
What's your mama's name?

32:10.887 --> 32:13.567
I grew up just the other side
of Frenchman Street, maybe I knew her.

32:14.763 --> 32:16.747
Even if I didn't, I don't
think she'd be real proud

32:16.771 --> 32:18.795
of what you're doin' right now.

32:18.872 --> 32:20.672
You want to be a big
man, you come at me.

32:21.568 --> 32:23.599
My son hasn't had a chance to live.

32:23.624 --> 32:25.060
Not for a long while.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.214
Now, maybe not like you, but...

32:28.780 --> 32:30.230
He's trying to make his way,

32:30.255 --> 32:32.019
and I want to see him grow up.

32:33.191 --> 32:34.677
Go to prom.

32:35.198 --> 32:36.455
Get a job.

32:36.932 --> 32:38.356
Get married.

32:42.453 --> 32:44.372
You want that stuff, too, right?

32:47.232 --> 32:49.015
Look, I ain't tryna to...

32:49.406 --> 32:51.036
Don't shoot.

32:51.401 --> 32:52.401
I won't.

32:53.992 --> 32:55.104
You can trust me.

34:12.998 --> 34:14.319
You don't need to listen to that.

34:18.166 --> 34:20.110
They ain't gonna let this go.

34:20.136 --> 34:21.616
I'll go out and distract them.

34:21.761 --> 34:24.204
- Mom.
- They are gonna find us.

34:24.556 --> 34:27.634
And they're gonna kill us both...
at least this way, you can run away.

34:27.659 --> 34:29.179
Look, there's another way out of this.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.270
I can make this right.

35:02.045 --> 35:03.518
Look, it's just one more,

35:03.655 --> 35:05.166
and then we'll be out of here, okay?

35:06.198 --> 35:07.518
Okay...

35:08.295 --> 35:09.886
I can make time if you can.

35:24.527 --> 35:25.648
What did he tell them?

35:25.672 --> 35:26.997
That the 5-0 is on the way.

35:27.444 --> 35:29.865
So, that's the plan,
to lie about the police coming?

35:29.890 --> 35:31.765
No. Not lie.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.476
Hey.

35:38.501 --> 35:39.660
Hey, it's Tyrone.

35:41.415 --> 35:42.415
I need your help.

36:11.354 --> 36:14.697
Ugh, one minute honey, Mommy
seems to have lost her keys, again!

36:20.834 --> 36:22.039
Ty...

36:22.064 --> 36:24.231
- Look, I'm not gonna argue about this one.
- You can't do this.

36:24.255 --> 36:26.956
- They could kill you.
- I'm gonna shoot for capture best as I can.

36:27.964 --> 36:29.523
"Pull your pants up," right?

36:31.007 --> 36:32.634
You know very well
that's not enough.

36:32.659 --> 36:33.677
Ty.

36:33.702 --> 36:34.960
They gave me 60 seconds.

36:34.985 --> 36:37.346
- I'm on about 40-something...
- Then get her out of here.

36:37.371 --> 36:38.678
Tell them I held her hostage,

36:38.703 --> 36:40.334
and she had nothing to do with anything.

36:40.359 --> 36:41.647
Tell them I'm unarmed.

36:41.672 --> 36:43.219
- And, uh, I'm surrendering.
- Tyrone...

36:43.243 --> 36:45.297
Look, Brigid's one
of the good guys. Stick close.

36:45.321 --> 36:46.740
- I am not leaving you here.
- Ma...

36:46.765 --> 36:47.968
He'll be okay.

36:47.993 --> 36:49.537
He can take care of himself.

36:50.126 --> 36:52.246
I know that.

37:54.202 --> 37:55.788
Okay, let's get the hell...

37:59.635 --> 38:00.702
outta here.

38:05.368 --> 38:07.808
Male, 18-years old...

38:07.854 --> 38:10.416
two teams, Alpha team
enters through the front,

38:10.441 --> 38:11.755
Delta team enters through the back.

38:11.779 --> 38:14.217
- Hey, I told you, he's unarmed.
- Uh-huh.

38:14.242 --> 38:15.300
So was Fuchs.

38:15.705 --> 38:17.964
Hey! Let go of me!

38:17.989 --> 38:19.550
Tyrone!

38:19.574 --> 38:21.900
Tyrone, they're coming for you!

38:45.425 --> 38:46.975
Shit...

38:47.000 --> 38:48.560
Yup...

38:50.377 --> 38:52.177
Tyrone!

38:55.758 --> 38:57.296
Ma'am, calm down.

39:21.624 --> 39:22.816
I'm sorry.

39:25.682 --> 39:28.233
What was that?

39:28.258 --> 39:30.782
I said... I'm sorry.

39:31.563 --> 39:33.521
Yeah. I don't care.

39:34.433 --> 39:35.661
Ahh!

40:15.081 --> 40:18.015
What is happening?

40:18.092 --> 40:19.557
I broke the rules.

40:42.248 --> 40:44.776
Ty? Ty!

40:49.565 --> 40:50.862
Tandy?

40:57.878 --> 40:59.200
Tandy, what happened?
