WEBVTT

00:49.466 --> 00:51.885
[speaking German]

00:51.968 --> 00:55.138
[Grant] From his rise to leadership
in 1921

00:55.221 --> 00:58.308
to his death by suicide in 1945,

00:58.391 --> 01:01.686
over 40 attempts were made
on Adolf Hitler's life.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.356
When it comes to the more
eccentric proposals

01:05.440 --> 01:07.067
to terminate the Nazi madman...

01:09.819 --> 01:13.031
the British Secret Service
surely takes the cake.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.658
Gentlemen, we need a new approach.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.286
None of the usual methods have worked.

01:19.996 --> 01:24.042
Several would-be assassins
have tried killing him with bullets.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.756
At least two time bombs have been used.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.717
And attempts have been made
to poison his food.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.845
On each occasion,
his tasters paid the price.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.932
His followers call him "Superman."

01:39.432 --> 01:41.476
He's no Superman, gentlemen,

01:41.559 --> 01:43.895
but he is a "super-male."

01:43.978 --> 01:45.855
He has the aggressive personality type,

01:45.939 --> 01:49.067
associated with an excess of testosterone.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.944
[Thomas] What are you proposing?

01:51.027 --> 01:53.780
That we neutralize him with... estrogen.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.074
The female sex hormone.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.246
[laughing]

02:01.329 --> 02:04.499
Gentlemen! This is not a laughing matter.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.168
This is based on serious science.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.714
Are you kidding me? Is this for real?

02:11.798 --> 02:14.717
I know it's hard to believe,
but it is totally true

02:14.801 --> 02:18.012
and it's our first contender
for crazy World War II weapons.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.014
Now, I imagine it gets crazy during war,

02:20.098 --> 02:22.642
but I don't think I'm ready
to go down this rabbit hole.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.061
[Grant] Yeah, it's going to get weird.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.023
We're investigating six
of the strangest weapons

02:29.107 --> 02:30.650
the Allies dreamed up
during the war...

02:30.733 --> 02:31.985
[man] Straight from Washington.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.362
-to find the most wacky.
-Jolly good.

02:36.239 --> 02:40.243
From an eccentric British bid
to unlock Germany's D-Day defenses...

02:40.326 --> 02:41.494
The Great Panjandrum, sir.

02:42.704 --> 02:46.416
to a bizarre attempt to give
the French resistance a whiff of victory.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.751
This place is contaminated. Get out.

02:49.460 --> 02:53.923
And a radical proposal for landing
battle supplies without parachutes.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.967
I love rockets.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.887
We'll score and rank all six

02:59.387 --> 03:03.099
to see which will become
our craziest weapon of World War II.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.310
How are we gonna score the contenders?

03:05.393 --> 03:07.186
Let's go over the criteria.
Number one.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.314
How long was the project live?

03:09.731 --> 03:12.400
Criteria number two.
How well did the project work?

03:12.483 --> 03:14.110
And criteria number three.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.570
How crazy was it?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.113
Speaking of which,

03:17.196 --> 03:20.825
what happened to your plan
to turn Herr Hitler into Her Hitler?

03:20.909 --> 03:24.495
All right, well, just let
these Secret Service guys explain to you

03:24.579 --> 03:25.955
the details of the plan.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.000
We already have agents in place
to make this work.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.086
This is one of our men here.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.672
Secret Agent Benson.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.976
He simply needs to add
doses of estrogen to Hitler's food.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.148
But won't his tasters pick it up?

04:19.676 --> 04:22.136
[Russell]
No, estrogen is tasteless

04:22.220 --> 04:25.431
and the effects will be subtle
and slow to act.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.101
[speaking German]

04:31.354 --> 04:32.855
[speaking German]

04:37.360 --> 04:39.237
[Thomas] So, how long will this take?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.239
The time frame is elusive.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.492
Perhaps within a month or two,

04:44.575 --> 04:47.537
his powers of empathy and compassion
will increase.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.581
[sneezes and sniffles]

04:50.665 --> 04:51.749
[in German] God bless you.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.751
[in German]
Pardon me. Thank you, my führer.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.255
[Russell] He may even experience
maternal instincts.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.923
Have you got a cold?

04:59.507 --> 05:00.383
I think so.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.430
[Hitler grunts]

05:07.390 --> 05:09.934
Blow. Blow.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.769
Blow.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.146
Again. Again.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.398
[blowing]

05:16.566 --> 05:17.442
[Hitler] Good.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.035
[Hitler] Good.

05:33.458 --> 05:37.628
After several months, we should see signs
of Hitler becoming less aggressive.

05:38.629 --> 05:43.468
When the older ones among us falter.

05:43.551 --> 05:50.224
The youth will stiffen and remain
until their bodies decay.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.269
[speaking German]

05:53.770 --> 05:55.855
[Russell] The science is still
in its infancy.

05:59.108 --> 06:03.863
Eventually, we believe he may develop
a greater connection to mankind.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.538
[Tory] No way. This cannot be true.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.750
Look, I knew you wouldn't believe me,
I wouldn't either,

06:15.833 --> 06:18.002
so I contacted Brian Ford,

06:18.086 --> 06:21.756
the researcher that discovered the story
when it was recently declassified.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.050
The Americans put it rather well.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.844
They said, "Take away his mustache
and give him breasts."

06:26.928 --> 06:28.805
Really? You're kidding me?

06:28.888 --> 06:32.225
I'm being serious,
this was actually considered.

06:33.392 --> 06:37.647
The number of secret agents in Germany
was quite high

06:38.356 --> 06:42.527
and it would certainly have been possible
to have got something into his food.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.655
-So, like a chemical estrogen?
-Yes.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.865
So, fill me in on the rest of the plan.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.828
[Ford] In the 1930s, it was believed

06:51.911 --> 06:54.414
chemicals in the body
controlled everything.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.582
So, it seemed fairly logical.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.627
Give it to Hitler and he'll stop
being an aggressive man

06:59.710 --> 07:02.672
and turn into a gentle
and mild-mannered... woman.

07:04.632 --> 07:08.177
And instead of going to war,
he might turn his back on the whole idea.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.896
It's entirely possible, even likely,

07:19.522 --> 07:22.024
that he will grow breasts.

07:22.108 --> 07:22.942
Yes...

07:35.830 --> 07:39.208
[singing in German]

08:02.565 --> 08:05.735
All right, so we believe you
that this is a secret plan,

08:05.818 --> 08:08.154
but no way this got off the ground.
Did it?

08:08.237 --> 08:10.656
Might as well hear it
from the man himself.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.493
Believe me, the whole idea
from top to bottom was silly.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.411
If it would have had any effect at all,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.788
it would have been to upset
his hormone balance

08:17.872 --> 08:20.166
and that could have made him
more angry, not less.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.961
And, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders

08:24.045 --> 08:27.215
the German State, the German Reich!

08:27.298 --> 08:29.675
[gags]

08:36.224 --> 08:39.268
[Grant] Among the possible side effects
the führer might have suffered

08:40.144 --> 08:41.521
were nasty bouts of nausea

08:41.604 --> 08:42.813
[retches]

08:43.814 --> 08:45.358
as well as headaches,

08:46.275 --> 08:48.653
which wouldn't have lightened
his dark side at all.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.866
And then there were
those other developments,

08:53.950 --> 08:57.537
which would hardly have improved
the mood of the leader of the master race.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.421
First one ball, now two breasts.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.101
And finally,
Hitler's famously testy nature

09:20.184 --> 09:24.564
would have been put under severe pressure
as his manhood limped away.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.232
[speaking German]

09:26.607 --> 09:27.775
[speaking German] Nein.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.152
[speaking German] Nein.

09:33.906 --> 09:38.578
-[Kari] Oh, he would have been so mad.
-[Tory] That is insane.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.622
What are we gonna give this out of ten?
A nein?

09:41.706 --> 09:43.040
[Grant and Kari chuckle]

09:43.541 --> 09:46.919
Seriously, we have to score this
and rank all the contenders,

09:47.003 --> 09:50.464
so number one criteria is:
How long did the project last?

09:50.548 --> 09:53.217
Never went live, so that gets a zero.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.219
Criteria number two.
How well did it work?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.389
The fact they never did it,
that gets a zero as well.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.266
Criteria three.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.517
How insane was it?

10:02.101 --> 10:03.769
This one is super insane.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.021
Oh, yeah, ten out of ten.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.481
They were doing some weird stuff all over.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.985
[Tory] Yeah, my first contender
took place in America.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.031
On the morning of December 7, 1941,

10:15.114 --> 10:18.409
the Imperial Japanese Navy
attacks Pearl Harbor.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.623
Two people declare war on Japan.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.626
President Franklin Roosevelt...

10:27.793 --> 10:30.004
-and Pennsylvania dentist...
-I'll make them pay.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.339
Lytle S. Adams.

10:32.298 --> 10:37.219
This part-time inventor plots
to destroy Japan's major cities...

10:37.803 --> 10:39.221
with bats.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.016
Bats? What the f--?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.811
Three things impress him
about the free-tailed bat.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.856
They weigh less than half an ounce

10:50.483 --> 10:52.860
but can carry
around three times that weight.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.656
And they roost
in dark nooks and crannies.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.827
Adams puts the three together
and has an idea for a secret weapon.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.164
Barely a month after Pearl Harbor,

11:05.247 --> 11:08.417
the daring dentist sends his plans
to the White House.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.632
Now, you might think Roosevelt
dismisses the proposal as crazy

11:14.715 --> 11:18.761
and gets back to the pressing issue
of waging global war, but you'd be wrong.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.472
Because Adams
is a friend of the first lady.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.310
So, the president floats the idea
with military advisors

11:26.394 --> 11:29.897
who, believe it or not,
give the proposal the thumbs-up.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.900
A presidential memo concurs.

11:33.901 --> 11:37.571
"It sounds like a perfectly wild idea,
but is worth looking into."

11:39.615 --> 11:42.660
Adams wins approval to build
and test his weapon

11:42.743 --> 11:45.121
in cahoots with the US Air Force.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.206
And in March 1943,

11:48.124 --> 11:49.792
he reveals the bat bomb.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.961
He takes a bomb casing

11:52.044 --> 11:54.463
and inserts 1000 separate
little compartments.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.884
Inside each compartment,
he places a hibernating free-tailed bat

11:59.593 --> 12:02.054
complete with incendiary device.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.600
Adams' plot is to deploy ten B-52 bombers,

12:06.684 --> 12:09.562
each carrying 100 bomb casings,

12:09.687 --> 12:13.399
to release 1 million individual bat bombs
over target cities...

12:16.569 --> 12:19.113
and release the rudely awakened bats,

12:19.613 --> 12:22.116
which Adams predicts will roost
in buildings

12:22.199 --> 12:23.909
over a 40-mile radius.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.664
When the incendiary bomb timers go off
minutes later,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.083
Pearl Harbor will be avenged.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.255
But testing revealed that this weapon
had a few wrinkles.

12:36.338 --> 12:40.843
Like the time that the bats set fire
to a US airbase in May of 1943.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.680
They incinerated a test range,
destroyed a hangar

12:44.764 --> 12:47.475
and burnt a general's car to a crisp.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.393
Despite this setback,

12:49.477 --> 12:53.481
they continued secret trials
up until the summer of 1944.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.610
I mean, some top-ranking
military officials actually believed

12:57.693 --> 13:00.738
that this bomb is gonna be
what stops the war with Japan.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.114
[imitates buzzer]

13:02.656 --> 13:06.535
Suddenly, out of the blue,
the project is canceled.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.538
Has the military
finally come to their senses

13:09.622 --> 13:12.124
and realized this whole thing
is completely nuts?

13:12.708 --> 13:14.126
Well, not really.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.962
It's just that a very different bomb
comes along.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.006
[explosion]

13:19.089 --> 13:23.260
At the last minute,
Adams' free-tailed bats are, well, free.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.262
And the rest is history.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.891
Bat bombs, really?
How long were they working on this?

13:29.475 --> 13:33.145
-[Tory] Two and a half years.
-Wait, did this even work?

13:33.229 --> 13:36.315
The experts felt this was gonna be
a viable weapon,

13:36.398 --> 13:38.734
then a little thing called
the atom bomb came along

13:38.817 --> 13:39.985
and they didn't use it.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.905
Well, on the crazy scale,
this one rates pretty high.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.325
-I don't think the bats liked it.
-This was batshit crazy.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.579
[Kari] In our quest to rank
the six maddest World War II weapons,

13:50.663 --> 13:54.250
my first contender is truly birdbrained.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.962
World War II.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.132
The battle for supremacy of the seas
hangs in the balance.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.598
In September 1943,
the Nazis unleash Fritz X,

14:10.766 --> 14:12.810
the world's first precision-guided weapon.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.982
Lift up your hearts, all will come right.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.069
In this, the Allies' darkest hour,

14:23.070 --> 14:26.490
the American military counter
with a guided missile of their own.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.494
An anti-ship bomb, steered by...

14:35.749 --> 14:36.709
Pigeons?

14:36.792 --> 14:37.710
[cooing]

14:40.212 --> 14:44.174
Project Pigeon was the brainchild
of one Burrhus Frederic Skinner.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.680
Psychologist, animal behaviorist
and visionary.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.391
How did he do it?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.645
Here to help me figure it out,

14:56.729 --> 14:59.648
animal psychologist Dr. Aaron Blaisdell.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.276
[imitates bird calls]

15:02.860 --> 15:05.738
Tell me, was Skinner completely crazy,
or was he onto something?

15:06.322 --> 15:07.489
A little bit of both.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.992
He was crazy in the sense that
the idea was

15:10.075 --> 15:12.202
to put a pigeon into a missile

15:12.286 --> 15:14.914
so that it can guide it to a ship
and blow it up.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.752
[Kari] Putting a pigeon in a bomb
is definitely nuts,

15:19.835 --> 15:21.128
not to mention immoral.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.798
But in theory, it might have worked.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.052
[Skinner] One pigeon pecks the ball
as it comes toward him

15:28.135 --> 15:29.678
and knocks it toward the other.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.890
If it goes past one pigeon,
the other pigeon can eat.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.186
[Kari] Skinner thought if you can
train them to play a passing shot,

15:37.269 --> 15:39.229
you can train them to be bombardiers.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.192
Okay, you ready for work?

15:44.818 --> 15:46.695
Now, this I have to see for myself.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.238
Go get 'em.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.283
Private Pigeon in basic training.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.244
No pigeons will be harmed
in the making of White Rabbit Project.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.830
[Aaron] First, you have to familiarize
the bird with the box,

15:56.914 --> 15:59.458
acclimate it, and we do that
by putting it in the box,

15:59.541 --> 16:00.709
give it some food to eat,

16:00.793 --> 16:04.254
and they start associating the box
with the food, so it's a nice place.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.092
Then you train them to eat
out of the food hopper,

16:08.175 --> 16:10.970
you light up a light in the hopper
when you deliver food

16:11.053 --> 16:13.806
so they start associating
that light with food.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.432
Look, Mom, I'm training a pigeon.

16:16.016 --> 16:16.850
Come on, peck it.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.562
Then put a visual stimulus on the screen,
followed by delivery of food.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.150
Visual stimulus, food.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.862
Visual stimulus, food.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.406
[Kari chuckles]

16:30.489 --> 16:32.324
[Kari] This got Skinner thinking.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.284
[Aaron] Just do that a bunch of times...

16:35.285 --> 16:37.746
and they start associating
the stimulus with the food

16:37.830 --> 16:38.956
and start pecking at the stimulus.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.002
[Kari] What if that visual stimulus
was an actual enemy target?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.462
This pigeon's so smart.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.465
The seeds of a bomb guidance system
were planted.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.428
Here's a rundown of Skinner's scheme.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.223
In phase one, he trained his pigeons
to recognize and peck

16:56.807 --> 16:58.892
at images of enemy warships.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.273
Phase two, the pigeons underwent
battle condition training,

17:04.773 --> 17:08.402
complete with turbulence,
sudden changes in altitude,

17:08.527 --> 17:09.987
and sounds of warfare.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.906
They proved unflappable.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.492
Phase three, the bomb.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.288
In most respects,
it was a conventional glider weapon

17:19.830 --> 17:21.540
with two key differences.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.418
A tail fin steering mechanism

17:24.501 --> 17:27.463
and a cockpit for a pigeon pilot
in the nose cone.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.466
Actually, three pigeons.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.010
Insurance against individual pilot error.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.556
Pressure-sensitive screens
sent adjustments to the tail fin

17:37.681 --> 17:41.060
so as the pigeons pecked,
they controlled the flight path...

17:41.143 --> 17:43.062
straight at the enemy warship.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.149
Sadly, a successful strike

17:47.232 --> 17:50.027
would make it the first and last mission
the pigeons ever carried out.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.746
Incredible as it may sound,
successful lab tests meant

18:00.829 --> 18:03.290
Skinner's proposal
received an official sanction

18:03.791 --> 18:07.377
and a $350,000 contract
in today's money.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.922
Project Pigeon was a go!

18:10.798 --> 18:12.424
But would it really fly?

18:13.300 --> 18:16.053
I want to know how effective
this crazy idea was.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.472
So, I'm going to conduct
my own Project Pigeon.

18:24.645 --> 18:28.023
With Private Pigeon pre-primed to peck,
here's the plan.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.443
In place of a bomb, a drone.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.696
In place of a warship, a target.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.241
And in the cockpit,

18:37.741 --> 18:40.327
Private Pigeon,
with touch-sensitive screen

18:40.410 --> 18:43.539
to control the drone's flight path
via wireless link.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.665
If we hit the target,

18:45.249 --> 18:47.626
Project Pigeon scores a bull's-eye.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.132
Okay, we're ready for a run.
Hit the lights.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.469
This is Project Pigeon.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.017
In three, two, one.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.769
Activate the drone.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.816
Come on, birdie. Get the target.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.026
Come on.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.611
The war depends on you.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.114
Yeah.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.452
Yeah, nice.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.581
This is actually working.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.587
Birdie, you're going off course.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.386
He's doing it.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.727
Come on, birdie. Come on.
Home stretch, home stretch.

19:46.810 --> 19:47.936
You got this, yeah.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.606
Peck to the right.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.150
As crazy as it sounds,

19:54.526 --> 19:56.278
it's a home run all the way.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.907
So, how does it score
against our three criteria?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.034
I can't believe this. Awesome.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.661
How long was the project live?

20:04.995 --> 20:08.332
Project Pigeon survived from mid-1943

20:08.415 --> 20:10.125
to the fall of '44.

20:11.001 --> 20:11.877
How well did it work?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.381
Mission accomplished!

20:16.465 --> 20:19.468
Wartime test results
were surprisingly high,

20:19.760 --> 20:20.636
so nine out of ten.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.222
And how crazy was it?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.975
Luckily for those pigeons,
crazy enough to never see combat.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.018
Eight out of ten.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.897
There's three more contenders to come.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.523
Catch that pigeon if you can.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.909
Okay, so my contender
is a machine so surreal,

20:43.992 --> 20:47.162
it's hard to believe it even made it
off the drawing board,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.957
but for one brief moment
during the Second World War,

20:50.040 --> 20:53.752
it was a real contender for liberating
Nazi-occupied Europe.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.714
Say hello to the Great Panjandrum.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.971
In 1943, this bizarre
Ferris-wheel-like device

21:04.054 --> 21:06.556
was being developed
as a frontline weapon

21:06.640 --> 21:09.268
in the Allied strategy
for invading Europe.

21:11.895 --> 21:15.649
See, the Allies needed to land troops
and equipment on the beaches of Normandy,

21:15.732 --> 21:18.735
which were heavily fortified
with all sorts of defenses,

21:18.860 --> 21:20.445
including this...

21:20.529 --> 21:21.947
the Atlantic wall.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.618
A huge concrete structure,
seven feet thick, brimming with artillery.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.746
Enough to bring an allied invasion
to a grinding halt.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.332
Enter the Great Panjandrum,

21:32.416 --> 21:33.333
brainchild of

21:33.417 --> 21:36.628
the British Army's Department
of Miscellaneous Weapons Development.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.549
-Hello, Brain.
-[in British accent] Hello, sir.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.426
-How's it going?
-Very well, sir.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.054
Good, and this big wheely thing of yours,

21:46.138 --> 21:49.224
you think it will give
the nasty man with the little mustache

21:49.308 --> 21:51.893
-a bit of a fright?
-Yes, sir, absolutely.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.271
Oh, is it teatime already?

21:54.354 --> 21:56.148
-Yes, that's my tea.
-Mm.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.108
Brilliant, carry on.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.153
[in normal voice] Here's the plan.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.614
Build two wooden wheels,
about ten feet in diameter.

22:05.198 --> 22:09.161
Pack the hollow central core with
about 4,000 pounds of high explosives.

22:09.244 --> 22:13.248
Rockets around the perimeter of the wheels
propel the Panjandrum,

22:13.832 --> 22:15.792
and launch from a landing craft.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.920
Up onto the beach, over all the obstacles,

22:19.004 --> 22:21.298
pushing forward towards the wall itself,

22:21.381 --> 22:22.924
where it explodes.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.302
Troops pour through the hole,

22:25.385 --> 22:27.512
liberate Europe
and bring the war to an end.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.933
That was the concept at least.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.644
The Great Panjandrum was a covert project.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.272
So covert, in fact, that until recently,

22:37.355 --> 22:39.858
very few people knew of its existence.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.152
One of those people is Brian Ford,

22:42.235 --> 22:45.947
science writer and expert
on the crazy weapons of World War II.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.785
So, Brian, this sounds absolutely nuts,

22:49.868 --> 22:52.329
but the British really took it seriously?

22:52.412 --> 22:56.458
It was designed and tested
under conditions of amazing secrecy.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.543
They put it on a train

22:58.627 --> 23:01.088
and they took it down to a place
called Westward Ho.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.384
Now, Westward Ho is a seaside resort

23:07.302 --> 23:09.679
and they tested it on the open beach,

23:09.763 --> 23:14.810
so thousands of people saw all
of these supposedly top secret tests.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.940
The not-so-secret testing gets underway
in September 1943.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.320
The Panjandrum actually
makes it to the beach...

23:26.571 --> 23:29.032
before violently lurching off course,

23:31.660 --> 23:34.121
almost killing an army cameraman.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.374
Private Mills, man that camera.
We need the footage.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.919
-Brain?
-[in British accent] Yes, general.

23:41.002 --> 23:44.005
-Your enormous wheely thing...
-The Great Panjandrum, sir.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.508
Yes, it seems to have fallen over.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.844
Yes, the centrifugal forces

23:48.927 --> 23:50.679
have caused the rockets to shear off,

23:50.762 --> 23:53.765
creating massive instability
and loss of steering, sir.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.517
-Bullocks.
-More tea?

23:56.184 --> 23:57.018
Jolly good.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.898
[Grant in normal voice]
And so, with upper lip suitably stiffened,

24:01.982 --> 24:04.359
the Panjandrum team presses on,

24:04.442 --> 24:06.194
and the problems continue to mount.

24:14.244 --> 24:17.497
Brian, I've gotta say,
the rockets around the wheels

24:17.581 --> 24:20.208
look extremely unpredictable.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.920
They were like fireworks
so they didn't burn consistently

24:24.504 --> 24:26.548
and during these tests,
the occasional rocket

24:26.631 --> 24:30.927
would simply become detached
and fly off into the astonished crowd.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.681
In desperation, they added
a third wheel for stability.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.017
But still no success.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.897
Next, they added a steering system
with steel cables

24:42.564 --> 24:46.860
which snapped and nearly decapitated
one of the team.

24:47.485 --> 24:51.072
Despite problems of stability,
steering and speed,

24:51.156 --> 24:53.909
Panjandrum testing
pressed on into the winter.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.206
It's January 1944,

24:59.289 --> 25:01.833
and with only six months
before the invasion,

25:01.917 --> 25:03.460
they have one final chance

25:03.543 --> 25:06.379
to prove themselves
in front of military officials.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.841
It makes a promising start...

25:10.592 --> 25:12.594
and it succeeds brilliantly...

25:14.471 --> 25:16.056
[dog barking]

25:16.139 --> 25:17.599
in scaring a small dog.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.647
-Brain?
-[in British accent] Yes, general.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.607
I'd like you to construct a new weapon.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.900
-Yes, general.
-A catapult.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.444
-Yes, sir.
-Then climb in it and launch yourself

25:29.527 --> 25:32.489
at that enormous Nazi concrete wall.
Understood?

25:33.198 --> 25:34.366
Yes, sir.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.786
[Tory] All right, the Panjandrum,
the flaming wheel of death.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.247
That is crazy.
How long was that live?

25:40.330 --> 25:41.456
Only about six months,

25:41.539 --> 25:44.918
but it's a lot longer
than some of these crazy projects.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.253
[Tory] How well did it work?

25:46.336 --> 25:48.922
It was totally unstable,
you couldn't steer it,

25:49.005 --> 25:51.424
and even if it did make it to the target,

25:51.508 --> 25:54.636
it would've left a hole in the sand
rather than blowing up the wall.

25:54.719 --> 25:58.223
I think we can agree on criteria three.
This one is awesomely ridiculous.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.432
Totally ridiculous.

25:59.516 --> 26:03.019
That being said, a wheel of rockets
that goes out of control and explodes,

26:03.103 --> 26:04.437
that is something we'd build.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.984
We've seen four contenders
for craziest weapons of World War II.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.068
Here's the fifth.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.322
A hair-raising invention
to air-drop battle supplies

26:14.406 --> 26:16.825
at terminal velocity without parachutes.

26:19.577 --> 26:22.372
Keeping lines well supplied
was critical for the Army chiefs

26:22.455 --> 26:24.040
of the Allies in World War II.

26:25.709 --> 26:29.754
No replacement weapons or vehicles
meant no victory over Hitler.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.381
[singing in German]

26:35.427 --> 26:38.555
But parachute airdrops
came with a few issues.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.974
A high percentage never
made it to their target.

26:42.142 --> 26:45.312
First of all, if the wind shifts
you get drift.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.399
-One.
-Secondly, it's such a slow descent,

26:49.482 --> 26:53.236
it gives your enemy ample time
to just shoot your cargo out of the sky.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.989
So, the British came up with the idea

26:56.072 --> 26:58.658
that they would just strap rockets
onto the cargo.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.744
That way it drops at terminal velocity

27:00.827 --> 27:02.912
and, at the last minute,
ignites the rockets

27:02.996 --> 27:05.165
giving it a nice soft landing.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.876
Now, very little has been written
about this project,

27:07.959 --> 27:09.878
code named Hajile.

27:09.961 --> 27:13.089
But I did find this
in the British Public Office archive.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.760
It says, "Parachute
for Hajile Rocket Decelerated Jeep."

27:17.510 --> 27:21.973
Proof that this was
a bona fide World War II military program

27:22.057 --> 27:24.976
complete with details
of how it was meant to work.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.855
The plane was to drop cargo
on a platform

27:28.938 --> 27:31.024
with rockets pointing upwards.

27:31.775 --> 27:35.820
Below the platform hangs a long plumb bob
connected to a firing mechanism.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.073
When the plumb bob hits the ground,

27:38.156 --> 27:40.617
the retrorockets fire simultaneously.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.579
They have enough thrust
to counter the effect of gravity,

27:44.662 --> 27:46.956
and it lands as gently as a butterfly.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.002
Or that was the theory.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.797
This was the practice.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.508
It is gold.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.552
The project engineers had
three key challenges:

28:00.887 --> 28:02.680
One, the firing mechanism.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.433
The rockets fired a little too late.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.519
Two, stability.

28:08.436 --> 28:09.979
The cargo is toast.

28:10.814 --> 28:11.648
And three...

28:13.149 --> 28:14.818
finding the correct thrust.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.320
Let's have a look again.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.530
[chuckles]

28:18.696 --> 28:19.531
That is awesome.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.034
Even though Hajile
seems to have been an epic fail,

28:23.118 --> 28:25.161
this was alive for two and a half years.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.789
That is a long time
to get to play with rockets.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.916
Getting a bit jealous.
I think it's my turn.

28:31.334 --> 28:34.546
Yep, I'm going to build my very own Hajile

28:34.629 --> 28:37.006
to find out
just how crazy an idea this was.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.007
One.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.349
[chuckling] I love rockets.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.435
To get started,
I need to do some test drops

28:48.518 --> 28:52.313
using this toy jeep
to figure out those three key areas.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.984
Firing mechanism, thrust and stability.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.028
First, thrust.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.615
This is what I'm working with,
they're just basic model rockets.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.785
Each provides one pound of thrust.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.955
According to my calculations,
four should be enough

29:09.038 --> 29:10.957
to counter the falling jeep's weight.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.504
The big unknown
is what configuration of rockets

29:16.588 --> 29:18.298
will provide the best stability.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.051
I'm not a rocket scientist,
but with my experience

29:22.135 --> 29:23.803
just a little bit of instability...

29:23.887 --> 29:26.097
I think
it's going to topple over the jeep.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.600
So, I'm building two platforms.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.643
One with a rocket in each corner...

29:32.812 --> 29:35.231
and another with all four
grouped in the center.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.608
[chuckles]

29:37.567 --> 29:40.612
Whichever makes the least mess
of my fragile cargo,

29:40.737 --> 29:42.572
I'll use on my full-scale rig.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.366
-Ohh. Is this our plumb bob?
-Yes, it is.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.787
Last but not least,
the rocket firing mechanism.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.748
We tried a plumb bob triggering device
like the original...

29:53.333 --> 29:55.335
-Hey!
-One.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.129
But I want something more reliable.

29:59.130 --> 30:04.093
So, I'm going to drop the Hajile on a line
and fire the rockets at a known height.

30:04.260 --> 30:07.722
It's kind of fail proof,
so, it drops, pin pulls

30:07.806 --> 30:09.808
rockets are triggered, it's perfect.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.229
With our cargo weighing two pounds
and using four rocket motors

30:14.312 --> 30:17.106
I've calculated
that we need 24 feet of height.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.235
Now I can remote trigger,
drop the cargo...

30:20.318 --> 30:21.402
In three.

30:21.486 --> 30:25.198
ignite the rockets,
and we should smoothly, gently land.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.158
-Two.
-Theoretically.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.076
One.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.581
-[Kari] Ohh!
-Oh, no!

30:33.665 --> 30:36.251
That didn't work out exactly as I'd hoped.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.713
The rockets didn't fire
until after Hajile hit the deck.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.676
So, after checking the high speed
we clearly have a triggering timing issue.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.470
But this trigger mechanism
is easy to adjust,

30:47.554 --> 30:49.389
so, a quick reset and we'll go again.

30:51.724 --> 30:53.643
In three, two, one.

30:56.062 --> 30:59.148
[screams and laughs]

31:01.109 --> 31:03.695
Rockets, same problem as always.

31:03.778 --> 31:06.489
Simultaneous ignition,
very important for stability.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.868
Only a couple of the rockets went off,
so it took a huge, crazy tailspin

31:09.951 --> 31:11.786
before it smashed into the ground.

31:13.788 --> 31:17.208
I gotta say I take great comfort
in the fact that I'm experiencing

31:17.292 --> 31:20.837
all the same issues
they had in the original Hajile project.

31:22.547 --> 31:26.301
The timing and triggering
of the rockets themselves.

31:26.676 --> 31:30.722
And stability... I mean,
all those things are crucial to success.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.683
Clearly corner rockets
are totally unstable.

31:34.267 --> 31:37.103
Time to try out my centered configuration.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.231
All right. So, putting all the rockets
right in the middle

31:40.315 --> 31:42.817
should give us a better chance of success.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.361
Okay, this is centered rockets drop test.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.823
In three, two, one.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.412
-It was better.
-Not bad.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.458
The high speed shows
that the centered rockets

31:58.541 --> 32:00.126
did slow Hajile's fall.

32:00.668 --> 32:04.631
And, while it eventually lost balance,
that could be down to uneven distribution

32:04.714 --> 32:06.132
of the cargo's weight.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.551
And that I can fix.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.931
When we come back to the Hajile,

32:13.014 --> 32:14.766
I'll be taking it full scale.

32:15.683 --> 32:16.517
Into the desert.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.435
In three...

32:17.560 --> 32:19.562
To see if this deranged contraption...

32:19.687 --> 32:20.521
Two...

32:20.605 --> 32:23.232
can rocket into our number one spot.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.317
One.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.280
[Tory] My next contender
comes from France.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.492
A secret weapon specially designed
for the French Resistance.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.705
Paris, June 1943.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.670
The once proud French nation
is under Nazi occupation.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.887
Only the brave fighters
of the Resistance continue the struggle.

32:58.851 --> 33:02.021
These fearless saboteurs
are planning a daring strike

33:02.105 --> 33:04.607
to destroy the morale
of Nazi occupiers.

33:05.191 --> 33:09.821
With the help of a secret weapon
invented by American intelligence.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.033
-Do you have it?
-Yes, I have it.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.202
Straight from Washington.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.208
Don't!

33:23.292 --> 33:25.461
For God's sake, that stuff is lethal.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.088
Parfait.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.966
I can't wait to use it
on those Nazi bastards.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.217
Good luck.

33:39.517 --> 33:43.438
[in German] Our tank division is stronger
than the ones from other countries.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.315
-We will win.
-[in German] Very good.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.608
Beautiful.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.868
[Tory] Using this weapon
demanded immense courage.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.378
It could only be activated
at close quarters.

34:32.904 --> 34:33.738
Was that you?

34:34.238 --> 34:35.073
No.

34:35.323 --> 34:36.866
Disgusting.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.451
Code name, "Who Me?"

34:38.534 --> 34:39.744
[speaking French]

34:39.827 --> 34:41.496
It was a revolting malodorant.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.207
A stink bomb
that smelt like the worst fart imaginable.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.501
-No!
-Oui.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.337
Shit. Unbelievable.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.254
No!

34:50.379 --> 34:53.174
Who Me was designed
to target Nazi officers...

34:56.803 --> 34:59.514
and cause confusion
and panic in the ranks.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.772
I know you're thinking
this one sounds like it was dreamed up

35:07.855 --> 35:10.608
by a bunch of schoolboys.
There's no way this could be true.

35:10.691 --> 35:11.984
But you'd be wrong.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.029
The American Intelligence Agency
actually created a stink bomb

35:15.113 --> 35:16.572
called the Who Me.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.783
Like, "Who, me? I didn't fart."

35:23.079 --> 35:25.164
To see just how nasty it was,

35:25.248 --> 35:28.417
I've called on a couple
of unsuspecting guinea pigs.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.129
I have a feeling

35:31.212 --> 35:34.590
this is not gonna be
your average day at the range.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.720
[Grant] Ah!

35:40.304 --> 35:41.639
[Tory] Hey, you guys made it.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.182
[Grant] Dude, what is this?

35:43.766 --> 35:46.102
-It's a shooting range.
-I can see that. But...

35:46.185 --> 35:47.270
What is this?

35:47.353 --> 35:48.729
Oh, don't worry about him.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.065
We have revolvers,
we got some ammo and rifles,

35:51.149 --> 35:52.483
I have some targets set up,

35:52.567 --> 35:54.569
I just wanna see how well you can shoot.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.197
I do like shooting guns
so I will do my best to ignore the fact

35:58.281 --> 36:00.116
that there's a guy
in a hazmat suit behind me.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.828
These guys have no idea
what they are in for.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.293
You guys are sharpshooters.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.629
In order to find out
how powerful the stink bomb was...

36:15.464 --> 36:17.383
I'm having them do some target tests.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.511
First without...

36:21.929 --> 36:23.014
then, later, with the stink.

36:26.976 --> 36:31.564
But before that, back to the lab
to meet the man behind the hazmat mask.

36:31.647 --> 36:35.943
What are you guys all doing here still?
This place is contaminated! Get out!

36:36.527 --> 36:38.279
Meet chemist Jesse.

36:38.362 --> 36:41.741
My eyes are watering already
and we haven't even opened up these jars.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.952
Right, it stinks bad
and we haven't even started yet.

36:45.620 --> 36:50.499
[Tory] Now, your typical chemical weapon
is something that causes bodily harm.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.794
This is just an attack on your senses.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.505
[Taylor] Right.
Instead of killing the enemy,

36:56.589 --> 36:58.716
this is to deny them terrain or territory.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.761
-Can I open it?
-Yeah, go ahead and put the jar down

37:01.844 --> 37:04.347
-on the table and then take the cap off.
-Gotcha.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.598
That way I don't drop it.

37:05.681 --> 37:08.976
And the second purpose
is to cause a psychological effect.

37:09.769 --> 37:10.853
[groans]

37:11.854 --> 37:12.855
Disorientation...

37:15.358 --> 37:16.317
and even panic.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.527
[groans and gags]

37:18.611 --> 37:20.279
Oh, that's potent.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.741
So, what have you brought here
that they used for that weapon?

37:23.824 --> 37:25.785
[Taylor] Well, in the stink bomb,
number one,

37:25.868 --> 37:28.287
the most universal aversion to a bad odor,

37:28.371 --> 37:31.582
fecal material,
like the chemical 3-methylindole.

37:31.666 --> 37:32.667
[Tory] So, like, poop.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.044
[gags]

37:35.127 --> 37:37.922
[Taylor] Another smell,
we keep going back to nature for this,

37:38.005 --> 37:39.215
is the skunk smell.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.092
Oh, that is foul!

37:41.926 --> 37:44.804
[Taylor] Octyl mercaptan
or 1-octanethiol.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.515
Are you guys smelling this?

37:48.808 --> 37:51.852
[Tory] Like some kind of
perverse reverse perfumer,

37:51.936 --> 37:54.272
Jesse goes to work
blending the ingredients

37:54.355 --> 37:56.857
of the original World War II stink bomb.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.567
[blows raspberry]

38:01.404 --> 38:03.281
Question is, will the Who Me...

38:03.864 --> 38:04.740
Good grouping.

38:05.157 --> 38:08.160
panic Kari and Grant enough
to spoil their aim?

38:08.786 --> 38:11.872
Well, that was our control test.
You guys ready for the experiment?

38:12.790 --> 38:14.125
What hell do you have in store for us?

38:14.208 --> 38:17.086
Jessie and I have been experimenting
with making stink bombs.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.547
A little ammonia sulphite
and butyl mercaptan.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.800
Wait, mercaptans,
isn't that the constituents in a fart

38:22.883 --> 38:24.093
that make it stink?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.470
-You got it.
-[Kari] No.

38:26.554 --> 38:30.224
-I made you guys little fart bombs.
-It's gonna be a gun farty party.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.102
Well, at least I'm suffering
with you guys.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.313
Doesn't that make you feel
a little better?

38:35.396 --> 38:36.647
[gags]

38:39.525 --> 38:41.235
[coughs]

38:41.319 --> 38:43.195
Oh, my God, I can smell it already.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.822
-[Grant] What's wrong with you?
-My God.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.908
-Oh, my God.
-We're gonna start with pistols.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.869
[coughing]

38:53.372 --> 38:54.373
[Tory gags]

38:59.670 --> 39:02.882
[Tory] When I started researching,
this story seemed nuts.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.092
[gags]

39:07.553 --> 39:09.597
It sounded too far-fetched to be true.

39:10.097 --> 39:12.516
[Tory] Okay, let's move on to rifles.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.269
-[all groaning]
-How good is that?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.396
[gags]

39:18.022 --> 39:18.856
I gotta get out of here.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.984
Don't give up, Kari.
Don't leave your position.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.864
Now, I can see only too well...

39:27.365 --> 39:29.909
what those Second World War scientists
were driving at.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.539
Oh, God. Can we get out of here?
Can we stop this nonsense?

39:37.458 --> 39:38.793
[Tory] Did you enjoy that?

39:41.087 --> 39:43.047
Well, was that fun or what?

39:43.631 --> 39:44.799
[chuckles]

39:44.965 --> 39:46.550
Not my favorite day at the range.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.345
[Tory] Look at the results,
it's really interesting.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.222
Pre-stink, lots of hits.

39:51.555 --> 39:55.017
Now, this is after
being exposed to the stink bomb.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.685
[laughs]

39:56.769 --> 39:58.813
[Tory] What happened?
Did you only have one bullet?

39:58.896 --> 40:01.690
My eyes were watering,
I could barely see the target.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.484
[Tory] Don't give up, Kari!

40:04.527 --> 40:06.028
-[gags]
-[both laugh]

40:06.904 --> 40:09.573
And while I got great results
without the stink...

40:10.449 --> 40:13.702
Who Me made me lose my cool
and miss my mark.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.913
-[Grant laughs]
-[Kari] Ohh!

40:15.996 --> 40:17.790
[Tory] Just kind of spread out my pattern.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.753
So, let's see how it scores
against our criteria.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.505
How long was the project live?

40:24.964 --> 40:27.133
Disappointingly, only two weeks.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.552
How effective was it?

40:29.635 --> 40:33.848
My test suggests it could have caused
some serious enemy disruption.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.683
How crazy was it?

40:35.766 --> 40:37.935
Well, stink bombs
are actually being researched

40:38.018 --> 40:39.895
by the US military today.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.983
So, it only scores three
on the crazy scale.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.867
[Kari] No lineup for craziest weapon
of World War II would be complete

40:52.950 --> 40:54.618
without the Hajile.

40:56.328 --> 40:59.457
A bonkers British plan
to air drop battle supplies

40:59.540 --> 41:01.834
using a retro rocket platform.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.752
What could possibly go wrong?

41:03.836 --> 41:05.004
One.

41:06.505 --> 41:07.381
I've done my tests.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.093
Now, I'm going full size, for real.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.472
The first thing I need to do
is build a platform.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.474
It's gonna be 8-by-8
and extremely sturdy.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.061
It also has to be very, very precise,

41:21.145 --> 41:22.897
because we realize
that stability is an issue

41:22.980 --> 41:24.899
and the rockets
have to be perfectly centered

41:24.982 --> 41:26.275
right in the middle.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.905
All right, so, here are our rockets.

41:30.988 --> 41:35.409
Basically, we have an electric match
that's threaded through a forward closure.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.120
Then we have our fuel grain,
which is cut into two pieces

41:38.204 --> 41:39.872
to give us a consistent thrust curve.

41:40.372 --> 41:43.334
Then we have our nozzle.
This is the pressure release

41:43.417 --> 41:47.338
because if you didn't have a nozzle,
this would basically be a pipe bomb.

41:47.421 --> 41:51.467
Now, we have a rocket,
which has 40 pounds of thrust.

41:52.051 --> 41:56.180
We are going to create a bank of 30,
giving us 1,200 pounds of thrust.

41:56.263 --> 41:59.350
And that is
what's going to bring our Hajile box

41:59.433 --> 42:01.769
slowly down to the ground...

42:01.852 --> 42:03.979
in a gentle landing. Hopefully.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.735
We are going to war with gravity.

42:10.319 --> 42:13.656
And with 1,200 pounds
of rocket power in our arsenal.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.699
I came out
to one of my favorite locations,

42:15.783 --> 42:16.700
the Mojave Desert.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.578
It's my favorite
because you can do crazy stuff out here.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.374
We've got our Hajile platform.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.210
Complete with 30 retro rockets.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.587
Now for the cargo.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.969
Giant fireworks
to represent wartime munitions.

42:35.719 --> 42:40.182
They're filled with black powder.
If we fail, they're primed to explode.

42:41.016 --> 42:43.686
All the films were black and white
back then, so you may not have realized

42:43.769 --> 42:46.230
how colorful World War II actually was.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.068
So, here's the setup.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.821
We have our mock crate
filled with all of our cargo

42:53.904 --> 42:56.615
which is going to be lifted
150 feet into the air.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.368
It's attached to a quick release.

42:59.451 --> 43:02.788
When I hit the button,
quick release is going to drop the cargo,

43:02.871 --> 43:05.374
we hit just the right height,
a lanyard's gonna pull

43:05.457 --> 43:07.626
triggering our rockets
and decelerating our cargo

43:07.710 --> 43:09.003
gently to the ground.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.297
Let's get our Hajile on.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.595
This is my favorite part right here.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.346
Either everything's gonna go perfect

43:19.430 --> 43:21.724
or the whole thing's gonna blow up.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.100
I love my job.

43:26.228 --> 43:30.232
Here we go in three... two...
one.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.154
Ohh. Whoa!

43:37.239 --> 43:40.409
Disaster.
Our triggering system malfunctioned.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.704
And the rockets didn't fire before impact.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.423
With the light fading fast,
it's all hands on deck

43:54.506 --> 43:56.508
to rig and reset for one more try.

43:59.970 --> 44:03.182
It's D-Day for Hajile. Now or never.

44:03.849 --> 44:06.894
Dropping in three, two, one.

44:06.977 --> 44:07.811
Go!

44:11.815 --> 44:12.816
Yes!

44:13.984 --> 44:15.527
Yes! It's working!

44:21.200 --> 44:22.409
Ohh!

44:24.870 --> 44:26.205
[laughs]

44:27.164 --> 44:30.292
Okay, so the rockets triggered
and it decelerated for a second...

44:31.085 --> 44:33.337
but the rockets went off
a little too early.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.590
But it did what it was supposed to do,
it decelerated.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.551
It actually floated in the air
for just a moment.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.387
And I thought we were in the clear...

44:41.470 --> 44:43.681
but then the burn time ended...

44:44.682 --> 44:48.686
and the cargo came crashing to the ground
and set off all of our munitions.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.690
You know what's cool?
We had a similar problem

44:52.773 --> 44:54.775
to the original
World War II Hajile Project

44:54.858 --> 44:57.611
which is getting the rockets to trigger

44:57.694 --> 44:59.446
at the exact right time.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.199
Which is probably why
they abandoned the project.

45:02.866 --> 45:03.909
So, how does it score?

45:06.954 --> 45:09.957
The project was live for an impressive
two years and seven months,

45:10.040 --> 45:11.709
but ultimately it was a total fail.

45:11.792 --> 45:14.294
So, one out of ten for how well it worked.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.422
But how crazy was it?

45:16.505 --> 45:17.464
It seems nuts...

45:19.508 --> 45:22.678
but it turns out
that Hajile's retro rocket system

45:22.928 --> 45:27.558
was later adopted and perfected by NASA
to safely deliver Curiosity

45:27.641 --> 45:29.268
to the surface of Mars.

45:29.351 --> 45:31.603
So, not as crazy
as you may have thought.

45:34.356 --> 45:35.274
[Tory] That's impressive.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.317
Let's look at all the contenders,

45:37.401 --> 45:39.695
average them,
and see which one goes to the top.

45:40.362 --> 45:43.031
[in German] The German Empire.

45:43.115 --> 45:45.534
[Kari] We've survived a barrage
of bizarre weapons.

45:45.617 --> 45:46.577
[groans]

45:46.660 --> 45:48.746
Now, let's see which one's the bomb

45:48.829 --> 45:51.582
by scoring them with our three criteria.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.626
How long was the project live?

45:55.127 --> 45:56.503
How successful was it?

45:57.504 --> 45:58.756
And how crazy was it?

46:00.257 --> 46:02.217
At number six, the "Who Me?"

46:03.093 --> 46:05.304
The project was live for just two weeks.

46:05.888 --> 46:08.974
How crazy was it?
Military stink bombs are in development,

46:09.057 --> 46:11.560
so, last place with three out of ten.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.729
Fifth overall, Her Hitler.

46:13.812 --> 46:14.855
[speaking German]

46:14.938 --> 46:17.774
This nut job
won first place for craziness,

46:17.858 --> 46:20.861
but the plan
never got off the drawing board.

46:21.403 --> 46:23.280
In fourth place, the Hajile.

46:24.323 --> 46:25.449
It looked pretty nuts...

46:25.949 --> 46:28.535
but it pioneered retro rocket landers,

46:28.619 --> 46:30.871
so, it ranked low on the crazy scale.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.248
Number three...

46:34.124 --> 46:35.167
The Great Panjandrum.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.920
This wheel of death was a total flop...

46:38.420 --> 46:39.755
[Grant in British accent]
The centrifugal forces

46:39.838 --> 46:41.507
have caused the rockets to shear off, sir.

46:42.549 --> 46:43.926
Number two, the Bat Bomb.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.177
Bats?

46:45.260 --> 46:47.429
The project was live
for two and a half years,

46:47.930 --> 46:50.140
and, in tests,
proved incredibly successful.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.770
But our craziest weapon
of World War II is...

46:54.853 --> 46:55.854
Pigeon Project.

46:56.438 --> 46:59.817
It was live for well over a year,
worked best of all the contenders,

47:00.317 --> 47:02.277
and yet, stayed respectably nuts.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.740
As crazy as one and two were,
they actually worked.

47:06.823 --> 47:08.951
When you think about it,
at this point in World War II,

47:09.034 --> 47:10.953
the Allies backs were against the wall.

47:11.036 --> 47:14.039
They were willing to entertain any idea,
no matter how crazy.

47:14.623 --> 47:17.876
Just goes to show you, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.294
Apparently really desperate.
