WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.171
.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.605
I just don't tolerate
in-house romance.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.241
You don't get to tell me who
i can and can't hang out with

00:09.243 --> 00:10.542
On my personal time.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.678
I'm not really the
sneak-around-behind-dad's-back

00:12.680 --> 00:13.679
Kind of guy.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.314
Says the guy that works
undercover.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.615
Let's just come clean.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.350
Voight will respect us more
if we look him in the eye.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.785
It's nobody's business
but ours.

00:22.723 --> 00:26.291
Hey, how's it going?

00:26.293 --> 00:28.027
Good.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.703
How's the coffee?

00:37.705 --> 00:41.573
- It's delicious.
- Glad to hear it.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.142
- Hey, sarge.
- Yeah.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.810
So either kev or i have to go
to training course

00:44.812 --> 00:46.345
For the new
penlink software, right?

00:46.347 --> 00:47.546
Uh-huh.
What's penlink?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.515
It's the--
uh, we don't know.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.683
(ruzek)
which conveniently brings us
to our point.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.586
Respectfully, i know things
didn't work out with jin.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.755
You got some trust issues
with the tech position,

00:56.757 --> 01:01.427
But i went to maybe three
computer courses at the academy.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.164
I mean, if you need to mic
somebody or hook up an xbox,

01:05.166 --> 01:06.765
I think we're your guys.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.100
We're just not
really cut out

01:08.102 --> 01:09.952
For the high-altitude
stuff, boss.

01:09.953 --> 01:11.803
Don't say another word.
I got the perfect guy for that.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.772
He did the explosives case
with us last year.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.274
Mouse, you remember him?

01:15.276 --> 01:17.242
I remember everything, jay.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.211
All right.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.114
Well, then you'll recall
that he did a great job for us,

01:22.116 --> 01:23.315
And when o gets here,
he'll tell you that too.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.417
(olinsky)
i'm here.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.685
Yeah, he was solid.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.088
Yeah, plus, he's, like,
a total tech whiz, you know,

01:29.090 --> 01:30.556
And i would trust him
with my life.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.657
In fact, i have...

01:31.659 --> 01:33.692
Many times.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.693
- Commander.
- Commander.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.161
Bring him around.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.163
All right.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.499
[door closes]

01:40.501 --> 01:42.634
You know lieutenant guthrie
from narcotics.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.236
- Yeah, sure. Hey, alan.
- Hank.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.672
For the last 18 months,
narcotics has had an officer

01:46.674 --> 01:48.640
Deep undercover
with a robbery crew

01:48.642 --> 01:51.276
Flooding the city with
schedule ii prescription drugs.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.412
- Uh-huh.
- Three days ago that officer,

01:53.414 --> 01:54.546
Rick manning, went dark.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.482
My undercovers
check in with me every day.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.816
If not in person,
then by phone.

01:57.818 --> 02:01.153
Ivory tower fears the crew made
manning for a cop.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.288
Well, let's round them up
and find out.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.857
No, we can't do that.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.492
This crew's part
of a chain of suppliers

02:06.494 --> 02:08.360
My team's been working
for two years.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.561
Commander,
this is the reason

02:09.562 --> 02:12.564
Why you need to keep
this investigation in narcotics.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.433
No one understands the stakes
better than we do.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.734
We already had
this conversation.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.870
We're not having it again.

02:17.872 --> 02:20.172
A detective in your unit
connected with a crew member

02:20.174 --> 02:21.907
During a uc assignment
a few years back.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.343
- Mm.
- Have him reestablish contact

02:24.345 --> 02:26.245
And find out what happened
to officer manning.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.580
All right.
Which detective?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.688
Cell phone's
all wired up.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.191
That's how
we'll be listening in.

02:44.398 --> 02:48.300
Last time you went deep cover
for vice, you almost lost it.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.336
You've never had one foot
over the ledge before?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.704
I just need you to look me
in the eye

02:52.706 --> 02:55.340
And tell me
you're ready for this.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.379
I'm ready.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.752
[shivers]

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.264 --> 03:19.231
What kind of blanco tequila
do you have?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.833
Blanco te-what-oh?

03:21.835 --> 03:23.835
Tequila.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.437
Oh, yeah.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.506
No, we don't got that.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.345
You lost,<i> amigo?</i>

03:39.286 --> 03:41.220
Hmm?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.761
There he is.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.498
I don't believe it.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.365
I don't believe it!

03:53.367 --> 03:56.435
[both laughing]

03:56.437 --> 04:00.372
I can't--you--
[laughs]

04:00.374 --> 04:01.840
I thought
you were dead, man.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.344
(antonio)
oh. When i saw cpd
raided your crib,

04:05.346 --> 04:06.678
Couldn't leave town
fast enough.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.547
Where'd you end up?

04:08.549 --> 04:09.982
Got as far as st. Paul.

04:09.984 --> 04:13.252
Knocked off
a "cash for gold" joint.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.454
Next thing i knew my forwarding
address said "rush city"

04:15.456 --> 04:16.588
For three years.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.591
[chuckles]

04:22.563 --> 04:24.496
And what are you
doing in here, diaz?

04:26.300 --> 04:28.000
Looking for you.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.005
Looking for work.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.709
I got to get some cash
pretty quick.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.511
I won't bore you
with the details,

04:39.513 --> 04:41.880
But it's family stuff.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.450
I wish i could help,

04:45.452 --> 04:48.053
But i'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

04:48.055 --> 04:51.456
And the crew
i'm rolling with...

04:51.458 --> 04:54.326
I don't call the shots.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.461
But i got your number,

04:56.463 --> 04:58.730
And if something pops up
down the road,

04:58.732 --> 05:01.600
I'll reach out.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.735
Okay.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.680
It made my day
seeing you, brother.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.914
Hey.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.083
We went through it,
didn't we?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.385
Sure did.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.620
Be good.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.076
Give me your wallet.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.345
Come on,
give me your wallet!

05:46.347 --> 05:48.447
Man, you do not know
who you're messing with.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.715
- Just hand it over!
- All right. Take it easy.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.483
Just settle down.
Hold on.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.884
Just wait.
Here, just take it. Here.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.955
[gunshots]

05:56.957 --> 05:59.057
This your car?

05:59.059 --> 06:00.659
- This your car?
- Yeah.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.612
[truck beeping]

06:20.614 --> 06:22.748
Hey.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.882
You did good.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.150
- What's up?
- How you feeling?

06:25.152 --> 06:27.652
- Felt like a bazooka.
- Yeah?

06:27.654 --> 06:31.590
I caught a .45 to the chest
back when i was on patrol.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.692
Thankfully, the plate
caught the round,

06:33.694 --> 06:35.660
And i only ended up
with a collapsed lung.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.631
Come on.
We got to go.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.498
All right,
antonio's in with cooper.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.133
He's got a sit-down with the
guys who run the crew tomorrow.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.668
Vince parker--
he did a dime down in pontiac

06:43.670 --> 06:45.036
For hitting a bank
back in '02.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.906
He got out, saw that the real
money was in pharmaceuticals.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.142
His crew's responsible
for a dozen heists ever since.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.610
Parker's the point man.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.044
If this crew
did kill our undercover,

06:53.046 --> 06:54.596
He would've made the call.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.147
Right, but not
without this guy's help.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.883
This is terry warfield.

06:57.885 --> 06:58.884
He's their hired muscle.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.485
He's got a rap sheet
for days--

07:00.487 --> 07:02.687
Manslaughter,
armed robbery, assault.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.923
All right, while antonio
tries to get in with these guys,

07:04.925 --> 07:08.427
The rest of you chase down
every other lead we got.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.562
Talk to your cis.
You talk to manning's wife.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.798
Sarge,
in lieutenant guthrie's report,

07:12.800 --> 07:14.132
He said we talked
to manning's wife yesterday.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.168
Look, guthrie
is too close to this.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.936
That's why
they brought us in.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.607
Got it.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.042
Hey, a chicago police officer
is missing.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.877
We do whatever it
takes to find him.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.613
Everybody hear me
on this...

07:28.615 --> 07:32.551
'cause i don't like
telling people things twice.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.619
Al...

07:34.621 --> 07:38.190
I want you partnered up
with erin on this one.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.759
Rest of you back 'em up.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.566
- Open up! Open the damn door!
- Come on, in here.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.867
Turn around!
Let's see your hands!

07:48.869 --> 07:52.037
Hey, hey, that's my husband!
We live there.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.772
We got a call
about a burglary in progress.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.973
Yeah, i'm sorry.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.641
I fudged a little
to get you guys here.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.909
We live here.
He doesn't.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.045
Son of a bitch
even changed the locks on us.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.964
All right,
tell me what's going on here?

08:01.965 --> 08:03.882
We put our place up on airbnb,
and then this guy--

08:03.884 --> 08:06.017
Yeah, and now the scumbag
won't leave!

08:06.019 --> 08:07.185
Hey, hey.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.553
(man)
i've been here 30 days.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.822
I know the law.
I got squatters rights.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.525
And that big meathead
out there threatened my life.

08:13.527 --> 08:16.628
He and his wife were supposed
to leave a week ago.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.064
Can you please
just talk to him?

08:19.066 --> 08:20.765
I mean,
we came all this way.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.001
It'd be a shame
to make it a wasted trip.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.705
Hey, buddy, it's the police.
Open up.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.808
Sir, i know you're upset,
but i need you to step away

08:29.810 --> 08:32.077
So we can find out
what's going on in here.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.879
Now!

08:37.083 --> 08:39.116
- You?
- It's all there.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.653
The rental agreement,
the bank receipt.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.289
You remember me?
Officer roman?

08:44.291 --> 08:46.925
You sued three cops
in my old district.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.093
[papers hit floor]

08:48.095 --> 08:49.694
That copy's yours.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.567
You both look
like nice people.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.770
Get a good lawyer,
'cause this guy--good luck.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.639
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
You're just gonna go?

09:00.641 --> 09:03.108
You called about a burglary.
This is a civil dispute.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.111
You guys are useless.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.979
Have a good day
yourself, sir.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.989
[sighs]

09:17.991 --> 09:19.591
Is everything all right?

09:19.593 --> 09:20.959
- Is rick all right?
- Yeah, we're just checking in.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.594
Seeing how
everything's going.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.695
Don't jerk me around.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.931
Rick's lieutenant
was here yesterday.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.616
Something's up.

09:27.617 --> 09:29.300
He just hasn't called in
for a few days,

09:29.303 --> 09:32.604
But that could mean
any number of things.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.205
When was the last time
you saw him?

09:34.207 --> 09:37.008
Two weeks ago?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.276
He grabbed a beer,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.946
Locked himself in his office
like he always does,

09:40.948 --> 09:42.647
And then he took off.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.249
Can we see his office?

10:27.260 --> 10:30.161
[zipper opens]

10:30.163 --> 10:31.830
Did you know
this was here?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.732
No.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.201
I swear to god
i didn't know.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.679
[sighs]

10:47.681 --> 10:50.982
Is the argyle manor listed
on his undercover profile?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.651
No.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.821
Yep, that's him.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.056
When was the last time
you saw him?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.391
I'll tell you exactly.

10:59.393 --> 11:02.894
It was four nights ago,
'cause the blackhawks were on.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.897
Holy crow.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.799
You got any security cameras
in this joint?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.801
- None that work.
- What about visitors?

11:09.803 --> 11:12.037
Anybody stop by to see rick
the last few days?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.272
(man)
well, one girl
used to come around.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.241
Might've even left with rick
that night.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.377
Is this her?

11:19.379 --> 11:22.013
So many people.
Tough to remember.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.282
Kev.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.185
I bought lunch.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.193
Girl left with rick
was a brunette--

11:35.195 --> 11:37.862
Young, long legs,
real good-looker.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.964
They were holding hands
and kissing.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.867
Thanks for all
your voluntary help.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.072
You're in luck.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.373
How's that?

11:48.375 --> 11:51.843
We're a man down,
and a spot opened up.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.445
Come on.

11:53.447 --> 11:56.047
- What happened to the last guy?
- Blew it.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.916
Like how?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.284
Asking too many questions.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.086
Get out of here.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.190
Parker and warfield
are good guys.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.209
You'll like 'em.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.227
Just keep your mouth shut.
Do what you're told.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.431
What's up, parker?

12:13.433 --> 12:14.866
Come on in.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.915
This is diaz.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.951
I know who he is.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.827
(cooper)
w-what you got to hit him for?

12:42.829 --> 12:43.828
(parker)
wake his ass up.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.396
- Whoa, hey--
- i know.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.766
(parker)
i'll tell him exactly.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.869
Yeah, mike diaz.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.874
You used to run
with biz and them boys.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.809
That's right.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.544
Biz told me about you.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.180
Said there was this girl
he liked...

13:02.182 --> 13:05.116
Some spinner,
i don't remember her name.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.885
She had a thing for you.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.087
Really pissed biz off.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.923
Said if i ever saw you,
i should punch you in the mouth.

13:11.925 --> 13:15.827
So no hard feelings, huh?

13:15.829 --> 13:18.563
Coop says you're looking
to make a little money?

13:18.565 --> 13:21.833
More than a little.

13:21.835 --> 13:25.436
How does three mil
of unpackaged oxy sound?

13:25.438 --> 13:27.372
It's at a place
called fulton labs--

13:27.374 --> 13:30.241
Set to get shipped out
to memphis in a couple days.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.143
We're gonna hit it tomorrow.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.878
What's our take?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.280
Our take?

13:35.282 --> 13:36.414
You hear that?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.483
Yeah, i heard it.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.819
You'll get two grand.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.086
Call it an audition,

13:42.088 --> 13:44.556
If that's okay with you.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.094
[sighs]

13:50.096 --> 13:53.965
Okay, but no bodies.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.367
Anything goes wrong,
we walk.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.137
Zero hesitation.
Agreed?

14:02.209 --> 14:05.076
You know, i like this guy.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.046
Yeah, i told you
you would.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.114
He's diaz.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.017
Diaz.
[chuckles]

14:13.019 --> 14:15.086
Look, i just want to know
what it's gonna take

14:15.088 --> 14:16.554
To get you people
to get this lunatic out of--

14:16.556 --> 14:19.090
- All right, everyone,
shut up!

14:19.092 --> 14:20.091
All right.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.893
- Well--
- zip it.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.228
Go ahead.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.796
Look, i totally understand
where you're coming from.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.363
You running for office,
captain hairdo?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.933
- Just lay out the facts.
- Do you even know the--

14:28.935 --> 14:31.536
This guy was a huge pain
in the ass in my old district.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.205
He's got five lawsuits
against the city right now.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.373
One of the recruits
was on probation.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.075
He almost lost his badge.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.977
The fop had
to assign two lawyers

14:38.979 --> 14:40.111
For him to get his badge back.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.312
I bet you the son of a bitch

14:41.314 --> 14:42.981
Moved out there
because they had his number.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.582
Okay, we get it.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.085
You're gonna have to go
through the eviction process.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.253
Which could take months.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.622
It could, yes.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.191
Jeff.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.292
I'm sorry.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.895
Jeff was laid off
last christmas,

14:56.897 --> 14:59.163
So we started looking for ways
to make money.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.366
That's how we ended up
on the site.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.037
I'm sorry to bother you
with all this.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.378
[knock at door]

15:13.380 --> 15:16.180
Police, open the door.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.515
Hi, mr. Freeman.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.050
Officer burgess here.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.119
So we contacted the cha.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.387
They're gonna hook you up.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.189
One bedroom,
one bath, walk-in closet.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.625
One month rent-free
for you and your wife.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.061
We aren't together
anymore.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.362
Well, that's even better

15:31.364 --> 15:33.298
'cause you can have
the new place all to yourself.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.267
But i already have this place
all to myself.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.069
Hey, you remodeling?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.637
There was a leak,
and i fixed it.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.572
The vespes will be getting
the bill, believe me.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.640
Now, unless you got
a court order--

15:42.642 --> 15:44.943
Could you please leave?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.377
The vespes
are good people.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.645
Article 9 of act 5

15:47.647 --> 15:49.080
In the illinois code
of civil procedure.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.249
I am entitled
to 30 days written notice.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.650
I don't understand.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.352
Why are you trying to make
everybody's life so miserable?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.521
What you're doing right now
is harassment.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.356
I'd like your full name
and badge number.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.390
Told you.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.625
No wonder
your wife left you.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.160
What woman--i mean, god.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.361
I really want to strangle
this guy right now.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.197
And that's all i needed.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.099
Thank you.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.637
I'm telling you,
this guy's like quicksand.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.673
The harder
you struggle...

16:15.675 --> 16:17.208
(voight)
$200k.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.609
(guthrie)
no. No, come on.
No way.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.611
That's impossible, unless he
was keeping it in his house

16:20.613 --> 16:21.980
Before he vouchered it.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.314
He have a girlfriend?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.716
Either for the role
he was playing

16:24.718 --> 16:26.384
Or just some girl
on the side?

16:26.386 --> 16:28.319
No.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.221
I don't think
you know your guy, alan,

16:30.223 --> 16:32.090
Or you do, and i'm not getting
all the information.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.591
You know i should knock you
on your ass

16:33.593 --> 16:35.059
For saying that, right?

16:35.061 --> 16:37.061
I'm gonna put my guy in
the jungle to find one of yours,

16:37.063 --> 16:38.429
I want to know everything
that's going on.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.764
You know, commander,
i think voight's painting me

16:39.766 --> 16:41.366
And my men with a brush
over here, and i'm trying to--

16:41.368 --> 16:43.580
(fischer)
all right. All right.
All right. Take a walk.

16:43.581 --> 16:45.793
Come on. Come on.

16:45.794 --> 16:48.006
Manning either skimmed from
this crew and got killed for it,

16:48.008 --> 16:51.442
Or they got him somewhere
trying to get their money back.

16:51.444 --> 16:55.179
And he knows if he tells 'em,
he puts his wife in danger.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.081
You want to pull the crew in,
lean on 'em.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.584
No, they won't give it up,
not these guys.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.319
I can find out
where manning is.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.638
I just need more time.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.022
Let me hit the lab
with them tonight.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.258
Your call.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.060
Yeah, give me a minute.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.229
Hey.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.731
Bro.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.199
You all right?

17:15.201 --> 17:17.300
Yeah. Fine.

17:17.303 --> 17:21.539
Just tell me, when this is over,
i won't be digging two graves.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.348
So, uh--so you two
were the guys

17:30.350 --> 17:32.350
That were in charge of the tech
before, huh?

17:32.352 --> 17:33.718
Yeah, that's right.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.820
Let me ask you, you guys got
a cat 5 or, like, a fiber wire?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.388
What--what do you think?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.357
- I'll figure it out.
- Okay.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.009
So wait. You were
in the rangers with jay, right?

17:41.010 --> 17:42.660
You know, i could tell you
some stories about this guy.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.462
Yeah, you won't, though.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.263
Hey, sarge. This is that guy
i was telling you about.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.416
This is greg gerwitz,
aka mouse.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.567
Yes, sir, it's a silly nickname,
but i'm the first to admit it.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.604
What's this about a truckload
of blu-ray players last year?

17:53.606 --> 17:54.705
Well, see, that case was--

17:54.707 --> 17:56.541
Actually, that--
that was expunged. I was--

17:56.543 --> 18:01.446
And busted for hacking
a d.O.D. Comm satellite in '09?

18:01.448 --> 18:05.183
For that,
i take full responsibility.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.285
Sarge, i know he doesn't look
great on paper.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.754
Just wait till you see
what he can do.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.324
Excuse me,
sergeant voight, sir?

18:13.326 --> 18:14.559
Would you--would you mind
taking a look

18:14.561 --> 18:16.327
- At your cell phone?
- My phone?

18:16.329 --> 18:17.428
Yes, sir.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.371
Cute.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.106
You see, i was able to crack
that in about two seconds.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.273
[whistles]

18:29.275 --> 18:32.677
Now, imagine what a hacker
could do with a day.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.546
It's fine with me,
but platt has to sign off too.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.648
(halstead)
okay.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.683
Okay.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.684
Where are we at?

18:39.686 --> 18:40.818
All right,
so the lab is on board,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.587
But it's too late
to switch out the drugs.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.288
Narcotics is gonna wait
in the shadows.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.691
They'll tail the crew,
id the stash house,

18:46.693 --> 18:49.227
And sit tight
until we know antonio's okay

18:49.229 --> 18:50.228
And we give 'em
a green light.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.196
We roll out in 20 minutes.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.332
All right.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.900
Do not move!

19:28.902 --> 19:32.170
All right,
all right, all right!

19:32.172 --> 19:33.804
Get the card.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.676
Move.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.179
Go, go, go.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.617
Let's go, let's go.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.556
On the floor!

19:52.759 --> 19:54.258
What the hell
are you doing?

19:54.260 --> 19:55.660
Next time move faster.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.428
Get him on the ground.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.265
Watch the monitors.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.300
Let's go.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.355
How's the weather?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.457
Clear skies all around.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.229
Come on...
Come on!

20:42.842 --> 20:45.476
- You got a problem?
- No.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.413
(cooper)
all right, we're in.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.624
Right here.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.369
Quit looking at me.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.280
- Come on, we got to move.
- New bag, new bag.

21:22.281 --> 21:22.847
Time!
We're out!

21:31.758 --> 21:33.858
Almost clear.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.863
What's this?

21:38.865 --> 21:41.666
You trying to size me up?

21:41.668 --> 21:43.401
Give a good description
to the cops, huh?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.870
- Not at all, man. Not at all.
- Huh?

21:49.876 --> 21:52.376
We can't just leave them
hanging out there like that.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.315
- Sarge?
- On my mark.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.485
Stop looking at me.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.020
Hey, we said no bodies.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.856
Fool's been eyeing me.
Can't leave him behind.

22:10.063 --> 22:14.332
Get up. Get up!

22:14.334 --> 22:16.000
We know who you are.

22:16.002 --> 22:20.738
This comes back on us,
we'll hunt you down.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.741
We're out of here.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.344
Let's go.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.488
You ever think about getting
out of the game, diaz?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.757
Sometimes.

22:39.759 --> 22:44.462
'cause i got a cousin who has
a roofing company in st. Louis.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.063
It's hard work.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.065
Literally, it stinks.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.135
You ever smelled
a hot mop?

22:51.137 --> 22:52.737
But you wouldn't have
to be looking

22:52.739 --> 22:54.605
Over your shoulder
all the time.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.873
I don't know.

22:55.875 --> 23:00.077
Something i've been
thinking about.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.812
I thought you said
these guys were pros?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.714
Your boy almost
lost it back there.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.617
Yeah, you never
can tell with warfield.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.018
What happened
to the last guy, coop?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.121
I need to know
what i'm walking into.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.622
They don't talk
about him much.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.623
He's dead?

23:12.625 --> 23:14.125
He wasn't yesterday.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.526
Today...

23:15.528 --> 23:17.495
Who knows?

23:17.497 --> 23:20.698
Look, just don't rip 'em off
like the other guy did,

23:20.700 --> 23:21.866
And you'll be fine.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.869
[explosion]

23:27.440 --> 23:29.140
(platt)
so you were a ranger?

23:29.142 --> 23:30.408
Yes, uh, yes, sergeant.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.177
I did two tours
in afghanistan.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.812
Why'd you leave the unit?

23:34.814 --> 23:37.148
Well, the army
gave me the confidence

23:37.150 --> 23:39.417
To pursue my dreams.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.751
That's why
i'm here today.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.154
What's this
about a medical discharge?

23:43.156 --> 23:46.090
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.731
Why the medical discharge,
mouse?

23:57.503 --> 23:58.836
Well, there was a--

23:58.838 --> 24:01.205
There was a convoy,

24:01.207 --> 24:03.441
And i was--

24:03.443 --> 24:07.478
I was in the--
the lead humvee.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.514
It was me and jay,
actually.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.483
Um...

24:14.654 --> 24:19.023
Um...

24:19.025 --> 24:21.459
- Hey.
- Huh?

24:21.461 --> 24:23.761
We're good.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.898
Just fill out these forms.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.902
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.107
- Honey.
- Hey, kitten.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.476
What are you doing here?

24:38.478 --> 24:39.743
I wanted to see
if you'd be interested

24:39.745 --> 24:41.479
In taking this exercise class
with me.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.613
It's called zumba.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.014
- I think you'd really like it.
- Hold on.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.883
Are you trying
to tell me i'm fat?

24:45.885 --> 24:47.918
No. Cruz teaches
this class--

24:47.920 --> 24:50.488
- Excuse me, sarge. Hey, mouch.
- Hey.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.557
Firefighters do building
inspections, right?

24:53.559 --> 24:55.526
Yep.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.164
Chicago fire department.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.502
Cook county court order.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.569
Anonymous complaint

25:05.571 --> 25:07.171
This building
isn't up to code.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.539
We'll need to come in, sir.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.814
I'm gonna have every one
of your worthless jobs.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.049
Good. Great.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.851
Now open the door,
or i'll knock it in.

25:28.094 --> 25:32.129
Make it quick, and maybe
i'll reconsider filing charges.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.065
I'm gonna do this
every day,

25:35.067 --> 25:37.268
Find a way
to make your life miserable,

25:37.270 --> 25:39.904
Until you give this place
back to the people who own it.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.906
Please,
will you just hurry up?

25:41.908 --> 25:43.641
Has that wall
been extended?

25:43.643 --> 25:45.609
That was there when i got here.
I just replastered it.

25:45.611 --> 25:46.810
Oh, i thought you said
it was a leak.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.579
It was.
That was different.

25:48.581 --> 25:49.580
Really, hmm?

25:49.582 --> 25:52.049
This ain't gonna
cut it, pal.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.851
That's enough.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.322
Hey! Hey.

26:00.826 --> 26:01.959
Okay, look...

26:03.563 --> 26:04.362
No.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.162
No--hey.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.305
No--

26:20.346 --> 26:22.313
Oh--you--
[grunts]

26:35.294 --> 26:38.295
- Nah, i'm good.
- Just have a drink, will you?

26:38.297 --> 26:41.298
[sighs]
okay.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.339
Come with me
to st. Louis.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.074
[chuckles]
and be a roofer?

26:50.076 --> 26:51.175
Why not?

26:51.177 --> 26:52.776
Let's just get
out of here.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.813
Let's take our cut, we split,
we go home happy.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.815
You're a real crack-up,
you know that, coop?

26:57.817 --> 26:58.916
Always dreaming.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.318
No, i really
mean it this time.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.955
There's a place for you here
if you want it.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.324
You got to decide right now.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.228
[glass thuds]

27:11.230 --> 27:12.896
I'm in.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.365
All right,
one last test--

27:14.367 --> 27:17.067
Loyalty, commitment.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.737
We had a rat in the kitchen
not too long ago.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.972
He needs
to be taken care of.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.742
No problem.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.055
Hey, let me see
your phone.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.199
I like to keep things tight,
so use this one from now on.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.210
[car horn honking]

28:01.380 --> 28:04.181
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.916
Damn.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.085
Yeah, we just lost
antonio's wire.

28:18.731 --> 28:19.763
(mouse)
sergeant.

28:19.765 --> 28:20.864
Any word on antonio?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.332
No, no, not--not yet, sir.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.135
All right, we got a designated
landline that he knows.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.804
- It rings, you call me.
- All right, will do.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.939
Oh, i did get a lead
on the woman

28:28.941 --> 28:31.375
Seen leaving the argyle hotel
with manning.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.843
Yeah, i pulled an image
from an atm cam

28:32.845 --> 28:34.111
Across the street
from the hotel.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.979
The id came back
as amber banks.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.482
Now, state tax returns
confirms that she waits tables

28:38.484 --> 28:39.817
At the tortoise club,

28:39.819 --> 28:43.287
Which is vince parker's
restaurant, so...

28:43.289 --> 28:45.389
I attached the--
the home address on the back.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.730
That's a nice pull.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.400
Interesting cat, mouse.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.309
(lindsay)
where you going, amber?

29:05.311 --> 29:06.310
Nowhere.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.312
Just going to see my mom.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.814
You know him?

29:10.816 --> 29:12.416
- A little.
- Hey, hey, hey.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.819
I've had a bad week,
and i am not in the mood.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.488
Listen, we know
you were with rick

29:17.490 --> 29:19.123
At his place
at the argyle.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.191
We know that you work for
vince parker at the restaurant.

29:21.193 --> 29:25.095
Okay? So this all
goes through you.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.197
Did you know
that rick's a cop?

29:27.199 --> 29:29.133
- And if parker found out that--
- hey.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.888
Anything happens to rick now,
you're on the hook too.

29:33.889 --> 29:35.239
Tell us
where to find him,

29:35.241 --> 29:38.342
And then you can go
see your mom.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.228
It's up here.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.559
Hey...

30:28.561 --> 30:33.096
Parker,
parker, listen to me.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.132
I'm a cop.

30:35.134 --> 30:38.502
Yeah, he started in
with that bs this morning.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.338
No, my name--my name
isn't rick matthews.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.875
It's rick manning,
and i'm cpd.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.443
He's just trying
to save his ass.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.379
If he was really a narc,
we'd be burned by now.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.149
Well, where's my money,
rick whatever your name is?

30:52.151 --> 30:54.284
I never stole
any of your money.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.154
I swear to god.

30:57.156 --> 31:00.224
But i'm telling you
the truth.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.959
You better let me go.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.230
Do it.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.434
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.169
Please, please, no.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.104
Please.
Please, please, please.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.640
Please, i got a kid,
man, come on!

31:16.642 --> 31:20.110
Come on, i got a kid! Please!
Please! Please!

31:25.951 --> 31:29.019
Do it.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.254
Do it!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.393
I got a better idea.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.995
Oh, you do, huh?

31:37.997 --> 31:39.997
Yeah, let me take him
to this spot out by the silos,

31:39.999 --> 31:41.365
Dump his ass there.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.001
- I've done it before.
- You don't got to do that.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.669
And how is that
a better idea?

31:45.671 --> 31:47.337
I don't want to have
to drag his dead weight

31:47.339 --> 31:48.639
200 yards back to the car.

31:48.641 --> 31:51.308
I mean, have you ever
done this before?

31:51.310 --> 31:53.644
So let me get this straight--
you want me to trust you,

31:53.646 --> 31:55.178
The new guy,

31:55.180 --> 31:57.547
With driving off the scumbag
who stole $200,000 from me, huh?

31:57.549 --> 32:01.385
- That's right.
- I didn't steal your money!

32:01.387 --> 32:03.253
[gun cocks]

32:03.255 --> 32:05.389
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.124
What the hell's
going on here?

32:07.126 --> 32:08.458
Parker, what are you doing?
This is--

32:08.460 --> 32:10.127
Shut up.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.528
I think they both
might be cops.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.996
- [scoffs]
- what are you--

32:12.998 --> 32:14.665
You're tripping now, bro.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.166
T-this is diaz, man.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.220
- We go back. No, we're boys.
- No, no, nah.

32:19.221 --> 32:20.304
Something ain't right.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.272
I said there was
one more test, didn't i?

32:22.274 --> 32:23.440
You blew it.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.542
Whoa, what are you doing?
Parker.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.678
Chicago pd!

32:29.581 --> 32:32.015
- Sarge!
- I'm all right! Go!

32:37.623 --> 32:40.691
[gunshots]

32:54.106 --> 32:55.305
Ah!

33:09.321 --> 33:12.389
[gasping, groans]

33:24.403 --> 33:26.069
Antonio, you okay?

33:26.071 --> 33:27.104
(dawson)
yeah, yeah, i'm good.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.408
- These two are dead, sarge.
- Call it in.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.544
Put your hands on your head.
Hands on your head!

33:36.215 --> 33:39.583
Cpd.
Intelligence.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.718

33:45.124 --> 33:46.390
Sarge, i'm gonna call
you an ambo.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.791
I don't need a damn ambo.

33:47.793 --> 33:51.261
Just drive me to chicago med.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.231
(ruzek)

33:54.233 --> 33:55.665
- Come on.
- No way.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.200
Come on.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.735
(cooper)
no way.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.181
State's attorney wants
to cut you a deal,

34:11.183 --> 34:14.150
But you're gonna have to testify
against parker's network

34:14.152 --> 34:16.186
Of suppliers.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.822
All right, a to z--
every participant,

34:19.824 --> 34:22.458
Every deal
that went down.

34:25.230 --> 34:25.996
Coop, i'll talk
to the state's attorney,

34:25.996 --> 34:26.763
Tell him
that you helped me out.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.399
That'll go a long way.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.139
I'll talk...

34:39.178 --> 34:42.312
But not to him.

35:06.805 --> 35:10.540
Hey, so, next thing i know,
they've got a gun to my head.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.242
They're--they're--
they're accusing me

35:12.244 --> 35:15.145
Of taking all this money,
but thank god i--

35:15.147 --> 35:16.446
You know, i kept my cool.

35:16.448 --> 35:20.584
What about the $200k we found
in your fireplace in your house?

35:23.288 --> 35:25.822
Yeah, that--
yeah, i was gonna get to that.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.224
I was gonna voucher that.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.725
I was gonna voucher
that money.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.427
Okay.

35:30.429 --> 35:33.530
Hey, lieutenant, i'm looking you
in the eyes right now.

35:33.532 --> 35:36.700
[chuckles]
i played this thing straight
all the way through.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.535
Rick,
don't say another word

35:38.537 --> 35:42.405
Until you get yourself
an attorney.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.574
(rick)
i didn't do nothing.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.810
I didn't do nothing
but risk my life for this city,

35:46.812 --> 35:50.680
For this department,
to put those animals away!

35:52.584 --> 35:55.685
Hey, i'm telling you
the truth!

36:04.796 --> 36:07.731
He's gonna be
up there awhile.

36:07.733 --> 36:11.468
The good news,
obviously, is he's alive.

36:14.239 --> 36:16.840
Everything
is gonna be okay.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.679
Can i give you
some advice?

36:22.681 --> 36:24.948
Sure.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.850
Marry a dentist.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.322
[sighs]

36:33.892 --> 36:35.825
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.727
So, unfortunately,
your condo's a crime scene

36:37.729 --> 36:39.396
For the next few days,

36:39.398 --> 36:41.331
Not to mention
there's a stench from--

36:41.333 --> 36:44.601
Well, his dead wife, but--

36:44.603 --> 36:45.835
But you got it back, right?

36:45.837 --> 36:47.571
- It's ours again?
- Yeah.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.545
Officer of the year.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.814
- Do you guys have that?
- Sure.

36:57.816 --> 37:01.451
'cause he should get it.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.720
Oh, thank you.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.400
Voight knows.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.568
I know.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.270
All right, for the record,
i don't care.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.838
I said we should come clean
a month ago,

37:21.840 --> 37:23.340
And i'm gonna go talk to him
right now.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.542
Jay...

37:31.683 --> 37:34.317
I wish it was that easy.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.855
You know it's different
for me.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.469
I understand.

38:03.815 --> 38:07.517
So we'll cool it.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.990
But we'll always have
each other's back.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.697
Always.

38:20.699 --> 38:23.867
All right.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.736
That's good enough
for now.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.817
Roll call, chain of command--

38:40.819 --> 38:42.852
It's almost like being back
in fatigues, you know.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.422
I didn't think i'd miss it,
but i do.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.458
I like the--the structure.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.826
I need this.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.562
- Don't screw it up.
- I won't.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.467
Hey, i want to let you know
that i really appreciate

38:57.469 --> 39:00.704
You doing this for me.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.973
You were there
for me, right?

39:05.577 --> 39:07.477
Yeah.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.579
Hey, you know
what's crazy?

39:09.581 --> 39:11.047
Is that you and i--

39:11.049 --> 39:13.783
We went through the exact
same thing that day,

39:13.785 --> 39:18.588
And i've been--i've been
bouncing around ever since,

39:18.590 --> 39:23.126
And you've got the--
the world by the tail.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.362
Don't be so sure.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.898
Yeah.

39:31.103 --> 39:32.702
So what's going on?

39:32.704 --> 39:35.705
You, uh--
you seeing somebody?

39:38.844 --> 39:41.411
I guess i was...

39:41.413 --> 39:42.779
For a minute.

39:49.788 --> 39:53.623
Can you date someone
that you work with...

39:53.625 --> 39:54.624
In our jobs?

39:54.626 --> 39:58.461
I mean, i know
what brings us together.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.596
If you almost die by noon,

39:59.598 --> 40:01.998
You're pretty ready
for a date at 6:00 p.M.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.401
Ooh, i hear that.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.902
But...

40:09.508 --> 40:13.710
My experience--the same risks
that bring you together

40:13.712 --> 40:16.980
End up weighing too much
for anything long term.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.483
Mm.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.621
Here's to plowing ahead
anyway.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.525
Cheers.

40:32.964 --> 40:36.099
Ahh.
[clicks tongue]

40:36.101 --> 40:39.002
Let me see a twirl!

40:41.640 --> 40:43.740
Oh, yeah.

40:43.742 --> 40:46.609
- You're not coming?
- No, you're doing fine.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.178
Keep teaching
your brother.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.447
Okay.

40:53.151 --> 40:57.020
Hello.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.721
What's the prognosis?

40:58.723 --> 41:01.791
I got to wear this stupid thing
a couple weeks.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.873
You know what puts you
on that ledge?

41:26.952 --> 41:29.886
You start to forget
who's who.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.892
[giggles]

41:35.894 --> 41:37.760
They're the reason
why i never went over.

41:37.762 --> 41:39.496
Hmm.

41:40.305 --> 41:46.288
