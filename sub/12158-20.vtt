00:06.941 --> 00:08.474
Good morning.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.610
Oh, it will be once this
bran muffin works its magic.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.979
I used to get a peck on the lips
in the morning.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.814
Now I get an update
on your colon.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.349
Colon?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.218
I hope you guys
are talking about punctuation.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.054
Listen, I won't have time
to make dinner tonight,

00:22.056 --> 00:23.622
So I'm just gonna
pick something up.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.457
Any preference?
I don't care.
I'm easy, honey.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.793
Oh, good. There's a new
greek place I want to try.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.195
No, no.
I don't want to do that.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.164
Do you really want to hang out
with the greeks?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.699
I mean,
that mediterranean work ethic

00:33.701 --> 00:36.502
Has got the whole world economy
in a tailspin.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.837
I just wanted a kabob.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.306
Where, uh --
where do you want to go?

00:41.308 --> 00:44.576
Honey, I don't care.
I'm easy.
Uh, then...Chinese?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.211
Pass!

00:46.213 --> 00:48.313
We'll all be eating that food
full-time soon enough.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.250
You know
where this is headed, mom.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.518
Just say texas barbecue.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.153
That sounds good.
I'm not picky.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.854
All right.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.823
Good morning.

Hey, honey.
Hey, kris.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.859
Boy, you spend a lot of time
over here.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.895
You're the one
who wanted to live with ryan.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.830
I think you go home
and take your medicine.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.865
I just needed a place to chill
for an hour, okay?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.767
Boyd had me up all night
with a stomach virus.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.336
Oh, so you thought you'd bring
that virus over here.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.772
Thanks.
Next time, bring doughnuts.
No, no, no!

01:13.774 --> 01:15.441
Don't touch the handle
of the coffee pot!

01:15.443 --> 01:17.342
You'll get your germy spores
on everything.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.111
I'll get it for you,
honey.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.613
Thank you. Maybe I should
just drink my coffee outside.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.582
All right.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.885
Wipe down that door handle
and then bury the cup.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.388
I am not standing outside,
okay?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.423
I promise I'll try
not to breathe on you.

[ doorbell rings ]

01:33.294 --> 01:36.061
So is ryan taking care
of my grandson?
Yeah, of course.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.964
Honey, men are capable
of taking care of sick children.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.934
Uh, yeah,
they're called doctors.

01:42.902 --> 01:45.637
Your grandma escaped again,
kyle?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.106
I'm so sorry.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.874
Well, listen, she couldn't have
gotten very far.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.209
[ doorbell rings ]

01:50.211 --> 01:51.944
Well, why would they put
a retirement home

01:51.946 --> 01:54.913
Right next to a bus station?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.882
[ doorbell rings ]
why won't anybody
answer the door?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.217
Kyle's not gonna be
at work today.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.319
Why won't anybody
answer my question?

02:02.655 --> 02:05.290
Hey, larabee, come on in.
Hey, baxter.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.459
Hey, I've been ringing
that doorbell for two minutes.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.794
I would have jumped
right up,

02:08.796 --> 02:10.762
But you know what they say
about white men.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.798
[ chuckles ]
we say a lot of things.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.733
Hey, you know,
I noticed you don't have

02:14.735 --> 02:16.668
A home-security sign
in the front lawn.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.438
I didn't need one until
the neighborhood got so diverse.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.006
Oh.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.108
I started my own
home-security business --

02:23.110 --> 02:25.744
Something to, you know, keep me
busy since my retirement.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.513
Hey, that's great.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.448
I mean, who would know
more about security
than a guy like you?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.283
Oh, you mean,
"who knows more

02:31.285 --> 02:33.352
"about breaking
into people's homes

02:33.354 --> 02:35.154

who's diverse?"

02:35.156 --> 02:37.122
No.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.957
I was thinking that
because you're a marine.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.827
But yours works, too.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.428
Hey, what do you say,
baxter?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.330
Most of the neighbors
are signing up.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.166
Do you want me
to protect your home?

02:47.168 --> 02:50.869
You got a lot of nice stuff
in here.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.638
I don't need protection.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.374
I got all the second-amendment
protection I need up in my den.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.942
What if you're not around?
What then?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.011
You've seen me on the range,
mr. Larabee.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.647
I could shoot the nads
off a squirrel at 100 yards.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.883
Oh. Hey, what if the robber
isn't a squirrel?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.885
Bigger nads,
bigger target.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.489
Just, uh,
think about it, baxter.
All right.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.725
A-and, eve, stop by later
with your pellet gun.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.195
I got a bushy-tailed baritone
in my cedar tree

03:16.197 --> 03:17.863
That needs to go
soprano.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.967
Okay, so your grandma's
on a bus to reno?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.036
All right, well,
good luck finding her, babe.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.205
And, hey, if she makes it
all the way to reno,

03:26.207 --> 03:29.374
Good luck
to your grandma, too, huh?

get this straight now.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.886
Boyd was sick,
and ryan was watching him?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.821
Yep.
But he's the dad.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.024
I know.
It's crazy, right?

03:46.026 --> 03:48.093
Mike, the world
is upside down.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.430
We should just all start
walking around on our hands.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.565
What's all the chitchat,
ladies?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.534
Hey, dad, what are you doing
over here?

03:55.536 --> 03:57.336
Ed and I are going off
to kansas

03:57.338 --> 03:59.037
For an overnight
hunting trip.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.106
I can't go hunting.
I got stuff to do here.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.608
You weren't invited.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.078
Just us vets.
Come on.
Let's go grab some lunch first.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.879
Good.
Like I said, I'm busy.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.948
You weren't invited
to that, either.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.552
You got to try the bÃ¡nh mi
at my favorite vietnamese place.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.420
All right.
I'll introduce you
to a kid there

04:15.422 --> 04:18.056
Who looks
suspiciously like you.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.791
So they shot at you
in vietnam,

04:19.793 --> 04:22.094
And you're going
to a vietnamese restaurant?

04:22.096 --> 04:24.363
Yeah, I have a very
complicated relationship

04:24.365 --> 04:25.697
With southeast asia.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.301
Dad, what did you do
to your head?

04:29.303 --> 04:30.769
Uh, it's nothing.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.704
I, uh -- I got rolled
the other night, uh...

04:32.706 --> 04:34.973
You what?
Yeah,
they grabbed my stash.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.375
That's pot talk for a --

04:36.377 --> 04:38.277
I know what a stash is.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.544
You got mugged?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.046
I was leaving
the grow house,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.048
Guy jumped me, and gave me
a knock on the head.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.316
Phew!
I came to,

04:44.318 --> 04:46.084
There was a cat
licking my face.

04:46.086 --> 04:49.121
Kind of nice.
I might get a cat.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.290
So, your takeaway
from getting mugged

04:51.292 --> 04:53.125
Is you're gonna get
a cat?

04:54.827 --> 04:57.162
I told you not to put
a grow house in that
neighborhood. It's dangerous.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.563
What are you using
for protection?

04:58.565 --> 05:01.833
Lana turner,
raquel welch.

05:01.835 --> 05:06.305
Because they're both
knockouts.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.473
What do you say
we get him a 9-millimeter?

05:08.475 --> 05:11.176
We customize it and get you
a concealed-weapons permit.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.444
I don't want a gun.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.945
I don't see so good
these days.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.280
You don't see so good?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.082
You're taking him
hunting?

05:18.818 --> 05:21.753
Hey, why don't you guys
take dick cheney with you?

Did you find her?

05:42.109 --> 05:43.942
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

an 80-year-old woman

05:45.879 --> 05:48.113
Playing slots in her bra
and a sequined cowboy hat

05:48.115 --> 05:49.481
Would stand out.

Did you grab the right one?
[ chuckles ]

05:53.554 --> 05:54.753
Eventually.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.523
The first one was way
too willing to get
in the van with me.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.359
My grandma put up
more of a fight.

06:00.361 --> 06:04.029
She's still of sound body,
just not so sound of mind.

in the construction business,

When he got hit on the head,
he was wearing a hard hat.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.514
This has nothing to do with him
having a marijuana shop.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.716
It has everything to do with him
getting older.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.552
Honey, he was carrying thousands
of dollars worth of reefer.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.321

06:29.323 --> 06:30.322
Mm.

Now who's getting old?

06:31.692 --> 06:34.760
I guess your dad's
just getting to that age

06:34.762 --> 06:36.695
Where he's gonna need
more help from us.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.231
I offered to buy him a handgun.
What more can I do?

06:39.233 --> 06:41.700
People are living longer

Despite your policy
of arming the elderly.

His vision's going. He says
he needs a doctor's appointment.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.007
How do I do that?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.376
You mention it to me,
and I take care of it.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.945
I just mentioned it
to you.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.615
I'll call in the morning.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.950
Old people
are so helpless.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.120
Mm.

And now I got my business
partner and my half-blind dad

07:06.126 --> 07:09.461
Running around kansas
with rifles.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.964
I should call and see
if they're both still alive.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.400
You know, I wonder if our kids
will be as concerned about us

07:15.402 --> 07:18.603
When we're drooling out of
the corners of our mouths.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.806

Honey, no, w-when you care
about somebody,

08:26.974 --> 08:29.007
You look after them,
and then they look after you.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.509
I know.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.010
If you're nice to somebody,
then they owe you,

where you want 'em.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.613
No, they don't owe you.

No.

gross old-person disease?

Oh, god. Mom.
You do look terrible.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.294
I feel fine,
and I look great.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.230
Now, someday --
decades from now --

08:52.232 --> 08:55.700
I might need you girls
to take care of me.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.369
So, when you say
"take care of,"

08:57.371 --> 08:59.137
I hope
you're not talking about

08:59.139 --> 09:01.072
Anything that requires
latex gloves.

09:02.642 --> 09:06.011
Maybe, yeah.
People get older -- things leak.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.179
Oh, come on, no!
Stop!

09:08.181 --> 09:10.715
I'm not gonna leak.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.919
But your dad and I might be
your responsibility someday.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.487
Mm. No problem.

09:15.489 --> 09:18.657
By then, old people
will be cryogenically frozen.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.759
So I'll be sure
to say hello

09:20.761 --> 09:23.094
Each time
I reach for a popsicle.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.829
Maybe --
maybe we could keep

09:24.831 --> 09:26.831
Her mouth open
just a little bit.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.433
Use her
as a bottle opener.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.734
Just like...

09:29.736 --> 09:32.837
Very nice.
Very nice.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.840
That'll teach me to discuss
a serious topic

09:35.842 --> 09:38.276
With people
who supposedly love me.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.278
I will be there
for you mom, okay,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.247
And one of these two
can have dad.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.582
Not it!
Not it!

09:43.584 --> 09:45.216
[ laughs ]
you're stuck with dad!

09:45.218 --> 09:47.218
No! I want mom!

09:47.220 --> 09:48.687
Girls, girls,

09:48.689 --> 09:51.923
There's plenty of future me
to go around.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.258
Wait a second, eve.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.026
I thought
you were daddy's little girl.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.394
I am.
[ sighs ]

09:56.396 --> 09:58.430
But it would be hard for me
to watch dad go.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.434
So it'll be easier
for you to watch me go?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.903
A little.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.638
I'll take it.
I'll take it.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.239
Um, I mean,

10:08.241 --> 10:09.908
You'd all prefer
to take care of me, so...

10:09.910 --> 10:11.142
Yeah, you'd be
a piece of cake.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.944
Yeah, you're easygoing.
Compared to dad.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.813
He always gets his way.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.781
No, no, no.
I-I don't know that that's true.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.583
Yes, like the other night,
remember?

10:18.585 --> 10:19.985
When you wanted
greek food

10:19.987 --> 10:21.886
And you ended up
with texas barbecue?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.421
You're a pushover.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.490
No, no, I'm not.
You are.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.292
Okay, maybe I am.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.060
But, you know,
there is definitely

10:29.062 --> 10:30.762
A give-and-take
with your father.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.997
[ doorbell rings ]

10:31.999 --> 10:34.566
And I get my way
plenty of times.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.267
[ scoffs ]
listen to her.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.670
She already has dementia.
[ chuckles ]

10:38.672 --> 10:42.140
Hey!
My hearing hasn't gone yet!

10:44.944 --> 10:47.445
Hi, chuck.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.615
Hello, vanessa.
Is mike around?

10:50.617 --> 10:53.251
Uh, no.
No, he isn't. Sorry.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.020
Oh, I was
just checking back to see

10:55.022 --> 10:57.255
If he'd given any more thought
to using my security business.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.657
Huh?

10:58.659 --> 11:01.493
Uh, uh, no,
he hasn't mentioned anything.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.194
Hmm.
That's weird.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.831
You know, carol and I always
share important things

11:06.833 --> 11:09.834
That, you know,
affect the household.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.203
I guess you and mike
do things differently.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.272
No, I, uh --
I wouldn't mind

11:14.274 --> 11:16.841
Reactivating
our home-security system.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.610
Oh.
Yeah, but, um, I just --

11:18.612 --> 11:20.512
I just don't know
if -- if --

11:20.514 --> 11:22.714
Oh, it's okay. I know you need
to run it by mike.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.283
When he decides
what he wants you guys to do,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.951
Have him give me a call.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.354
No, no, wait, wait, chuck,
no. No, no.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.523
Mike doesn't make
all the decisions around here.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.291
That "welcome" mat
you're standing on --

11:33.293 --> 11:34.959
Mike wanted one
that says "go away."

11:34.961 --> 11:37.996
It says "go away."

11:37.998 --> 11:41.032
Oh, damn it.
When did he get that?

11:42.568 --> 11:44.736
The husband says,
"try the kitchen."

11:44.738 --> 11:46.171
[ laughter ]

11:46.173 --> 11:47.405
Hey, mike.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.207
Hey, guys,
what are you doing here?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.742
Didn't you read
the doormat?

11:50.744 --> 11:52.844
We brought back
a bunch of rabbits.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.714
Vanessa said come on out
in the back and smoke them.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.983
Boy, you'll smoke anything
these days, won't you, dad?

11:58.985 --> 12:00.985
We're just swapping
war stories, that's all.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.821
Yeah, uh, pull up a chair.
Have a beer.

12:02.823 --> 12:06.191
Very generous of you, chuck,
since it's my chair and my beer.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.094
Believe this guy?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.329
Called five times to check on me
during our hunting trip.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.364
Oh, yeah.
Nervous nellie.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.934
That's why I got you a satellite
phone, dad, so I could find you.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.602
How come
you didn't pick it up?

12:17.604 --> 12:20.739
I don't like using that thing.
It costs 10 bucks a minute.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.074
Yeah, it reminds me of
a little place I used to go to

12:23.076 --> 12:25.477
In saigon
during the war.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.215
That was
10 bucks a minute, too.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.852
So what you're saying
is you spent 10 bucks.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.856
Ooh, mike.
[ chuckles ]

12:37.858 --> 12:40.125
You can't take shots
if you weren't shot at.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.861
Let chuck
finish his story.
Chuck: Okay.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.197
The medic takes one look
at my leg wound and passes out.
Mm-hmm.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.933
And I'm thinking, "man,
this -- this can't be good."

12:48.935 --> 12:51.136
Turns out
the guy was hypoglycemic.
Oh.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.271
Lucky for both of us,
I had a kit kat.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.307
120 degrees in that desert,
and that thing didn't melt.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.077
You tell me
god isn't american.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.646
Our medics were so hopped up
on morphine,

13:01.648 --> 13:03.648
When I got shot,
I had to pay

13:03.650 --> 13:06.251
One of the villagers
to remove the bullet.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.988
She stitched me up and gave me
a manicure while she was at it.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.758
Best buck and a quarter
I ever spent.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.326
[ laughter ]

13:15.328 --> 13:17.262
Yeah, I-I was very, very lucky.
I was fortunate.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.231
I got top-notch care
for my war injuries.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.133
I didn't know you were shot
during the war, ed.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.170
Yeah, I got my finger caught
in a filing cabinet.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.974
To this day,
whenever I hear drawers slam...

13:29.976 --> 13:32.844
I'm right back there.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.818
I didn't, um...

13:39.820 --> 13:42.253
I didn't serve, you know?

13:42.255 --> 13:45.190
I turned 18,
and war was over.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.624
It sucked.

13:46.626 --> 13:50.528
And that's the last war
the u.S. Was ever in.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.833
Didn't you go to camp
that summer at evergreen lake?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.935
Yeah, I got
that horrible sunburn...

13:56.937 --> 14:00.471
And, you know,
s-swimmer's itch.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.641
Got a big...
Spider bite...

14:03.643 --> 14:05.476
During the camp --
camp drills.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.212
Boy, look at those rabbits
coming along, dad.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.681
You guys did
really well.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.816
Your dad
got five kills --

14:11.818 --> 14:13.251
One at 50 yards.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.854
Yeah, hippity-hoppity,

14:15.856 --> 14:18.523
Easter's not on its way
for that bunny.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.326
I thought you said your --
your eyes were bothering you.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.961
I got lucky.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.496
You got lucky
five times?

14:25.498 --> 14:26.965
Well, after I shot
the first one,

14:26.967 --> 14:28.399
I had four rabbit's feet.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.969
Dad.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.704
You're clipping rabbits
at 50 yards.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.873
There's nothing wrong
with your aim or your eyes.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.508
We're not starting
that again, are we?

14:37.510 --> 14:38.910
Look, I don't need a gun
for protection.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.545
This is not florida,

14:40.547 --> 14:43.248
Where you can go around
shooting people for no reason.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.582
There's a reason --

14:44.584 --> 14:47.452
Same reason
I don't vacation in florida.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.489
I'm just saying you need
some kind of protection.
It's not that big a deal.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.191
I got this far
without your help.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.493
I can take care of myself.
Thank you very much.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.196
Ed, give me a ride back
to my shop.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.430
Yeah, okay.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.866
[ clears throat ]
let it go, mike.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.402
The last thing
guys our age need

15:04.404 --> 15:07.472
Is someone telling them
they're helpless.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.510
What was your nickname
at that summer camp?

15:12.512 --> 15:13.745
Buzzkill?

15:22.688 --> 15:24.889
Hey, dad.
Hey, mr. B.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.457
Hey, you guys hungry?

15:26.459 --> 15:27.959
Ew!
Yeah, no thanks.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.194
Um, we had dinner
at his grandma's rest home.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.430
It was
"eat with your teeth out" night.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.734
I had like
10 tapioca cups.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.069
I'm feeling
a little woozy.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.804
I might have gotten one
with the medicine.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.406
I've got to go
take a shower.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.474
I got hugged by
like 20 people who thought

15:43.476 --> 15:45.476
I was their granddaughter.
[ chuckles ]

15:45.478 --> 15:48.613
And one guy
who definitely didn't.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.217
Good night.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.486
So, um...
How's your grandma?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.988
Uh, she's good.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.823
I'm gonna go back
and sit with her a little later.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.258
She's still
pretty agitated.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.827
Probably because
you ate her medicine.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.997
When you do stuff like this
for her, kyle,

16:05.999 --> 16:07.799
Does she appreciate
what you're doing?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.467
Oh, no.
She gets really angry.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.336
She doesn't think she needs
any help,

16:11.338 --> 16:13.638
Especially
from a dunderhead.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.008
That's her special nickname
for me.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.744
Yeah, not just hers.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.913
I don't mind.
I mean, she's set in her ways.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.781
That's why
I got to look out for her.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.450
I'm sorry for what
she's putting you through.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.852
What choice do I have?
She's family.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.629
Yo.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.832
It's open.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.201
Yeah, I can see that.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.004
Dad, it's me.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.840
Uh, glad it's you,
michael.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.641
What would you do
if I was here to rob you?

16:50.643 --> 16:51.876
Why would you rob me?

16:51.878 --> 16:54.178
You're my son,
and you're doing fine.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.513
Yeah, you got me there.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.050
Listen, I brought the rabbits.
You left them on the smoker.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.451
Excellent.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.054
So...
How's the pot business?

17:03.056 --> 17:04.822
Business is great.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.491
I just hope
people know what they're doing

17:06.493 --> 17:08.292
Putting this marijuana stuff
in their bodies.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.328
You want some booze?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.463
It goes good
with rabbit.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.798
Sure.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.633
A wild turkey toast

17:15.635 --> 17:17.468
To a fellow
fallen forest creature.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.004
Try saying that a couple times
after a few of these.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.373
What's this?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.875
Don't get all excited.
Let me explain.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.244
Somebody ought to give you
a knock on the head.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.912
I do not want a gun.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.714
Just listen to me.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.182
If you want me
to take that,

17:31.184 --> 17:35.219
You're gonna have to pry it
into my cold, dead hand.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.588
What am I missing here?

17:39.525 --> 17:41.726
I don't
want to talk about it.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.528
Don't want to talk
about what, dad?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.264
[ sighs ]

17:46.266 --> 17:48.466
Look, mikey...

17:50.269 --> 17:51.936
...There are war stories

17:51.938 --> 17:55.573
Like ed and his paper cut.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.211
And there are
war stories --

18:00.213 --> 18:04.916
The stuff guys don't talk about
sitting around a smoker.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.953
I thank god every day
that you missed the draft, son.

18:08.955 --> 18:13.424
I would never want you to know
what it's like to kill a man.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.728
You remember their faces.
I-it sticks with you, michael.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.364
I really can't imagine.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.701
I promised myself
that I would never again

18:23.703 --> 18:27.705
Point one of those
at anything walking on two feet.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.409
Unless it was an ostrich.

18:31.411 --> 18:35.246
That would be
too good to pass up.

18:35.248 --> 18:38.316
Well, how are you gonna
defend yourself?

18:38.318 --> 18:41.819
If somebody wants my stash
that bad, they can have it.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.088
You know
what a stash is, right?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.490
Yeah,
we've been through this.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.492
I think maybe you should
get that head looked at.

18:48.727 --> 18:51.762
Jimmy and I had no idea
what you went through.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.398
We used to play soldier
all the time

18:54.400 --> 18:56.467
Just pretending
to be you.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.270
You've always been a real hero
to us, you know that?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.772
Thank you.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.142
I have a plan "b"...

19:04.144 --> 19:06.010
As in larabee.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.279
Chuck.
Yeah.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.581
I like this guy.
[ chuckles ]

19:10.583 --> 19:13.918
Doesn't have such great things
to say about you.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.154
I'd like to hire him
to do security around here.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.856
I haven't seen
a weaker defense

19:18.858 --> 19:21.959
Since the broncos
in the super bowl.

19:21.961 --> 19:26.831
I appreciate the offer, mike,
but I'm the father.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.433
The father takes care of the
kids, not the other way around.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.102
Look, I'm not talking about
taking care of you, dad.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.303
I'm talking about
the business.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.273
Remember,
I'm the marketing guy.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.608
And I don't think customers
are gonna take too kindly

19:37.610 --> 19:39.110
To stepping over
some old dude

19:39.112 --> 19:42.346
Getting cpr out front
from a cat.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.484
Fine.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.553
This larabee guy --
he know his stuff?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.354
I trust him
with your life.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.624
What about your life?

19:53.626 --> 19:56.227
Let's see how he does
with yours first.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.504
Hey.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.072
Hey, babe.
Where -- where have you been?

20:08.074 --> 20:10.641
I have a little gift
for you.

20:15.714 --> 20:19.116
You're welcome.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.520
You know, I also went
to that new greek place,

20:22.522 --> 20:25.189
And I got myself
a delicious kabob.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.758
Sounds like
you've had a big day.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.395
And I also hired chuck to redo
our home-security system,

20:31.397 --> 20:35.600
Completely unilaterally --
no discussion with you.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.870
Sounds okay.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.939
No, no, 'cause the point is,
you can't always have your way.

20:41.941 --> 20:45.209
Sometimes I have a way,
and it's a perfectly good way.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.211
Come on.
I'm very easygoing.
Oh, no. No, you're not.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.879
Ask the girls.
I did.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.382
I asked the girls, and you're
not the easygoing one.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.951
I'm the easygoing one.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.854
Okay, fine.
Let's have it your way again.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.389
Tell you what, give me the mat.
I'll take it out front.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.957
Huh? W--

20:59.959 --> 21:02.260
N--
yeah.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.128
No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, you --
yeah, I'll take it out --

21:04.130 --> 21:05.963
I'll take it out --
no, you don't get
to turn this around.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.565
No, 'cause -- 'cause you're not
the easygoing one.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.100
I'm -- I'm
the easygoing one.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.735
Well, I'll take it out --
and no, no, no.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.070
You're not taking this mat.
I'm keeping your mat.

21:13.072 --> 21:17.441
All right, well, once again,
you get your way.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.176
[ sighs ]

21:27.619 --> 21:29.687
You're gonna die first.
