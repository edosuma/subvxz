before you drop the money.

"Hey, and that's for you
and all the boys back there,"

You know,
I just hope that one day,

16:31.791 --> 16:33.893
I can have
what you guys have.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.801
Welcome back
to "Wake Up, Long Island."

16:41.868 --> 16:44.237
We've got a very special
in-studio guest today --

16:44.304 --> 16:47.840
a local firefighter
and a cat-catching
superhero --

16:47.907 --> 16:48.841
Kyle Gable.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.643
Thanks for having me on,
guys.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.379
And who's
your helper here?
Uh...

16:52.445 --> 16:53.846
Oh, this is my brother
Kevin Gable,

16:53.913 --> 16:56.049
a retired
Nassau County cop.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.051
He protected us
for 20 years.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.219
Well, that may be true,

16:59.286 --> 17:01.688
but today, I'm just here
to hold the cats.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.723
[ Chuckles ]

17:03.790 --> 17:06.126
Kyle, your story
is amazing.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.129
While on duty,
you saved a pregnant cat

17:09.196 --> 17:11.864
who then gave birth
to this adorable litter,

17:11.931 --> 17:14.301
all seven of which
are available for adoption.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.768
Well, actually, Kelly,
uh, only six.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.271
I'm gonna take the one
with the, uh, black socks on,

17:18.338 --> 17:19.672
the one that looks like
he stepped in paint.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.640
[ Laughs ]

17:20.707 --> 17:21.874
Does this man
ever stop giving?

17:21.941 --> 17:23.443
[ Laughs ]

17:23.510 --> 17:25.645
So, how's it feel
to be the brother of a hero?

17:27.614 --> 17:28.748
Oh, me?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.283
Oh, I-I-I thought
you were talking to Kyle.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.318
[ Chuckles ]

17:31.384 --> 17:32.652
'C-Course,
you wouldn't know this,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.887
but I, uh, I recently
saved a man's life, you know.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.123
Really?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.557
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And you know what?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.160
Uh, actually, put me down
for two of these babies also.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.261
Any two.
You pick them, Kelly.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.530
I'll take the ugly ones.
I don't care.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.466
Whoa! Save some
for the viewers.
[ Laughs ]

17:46.533 --> 17:48.335
That is funny, Tom,
because, you know, growing up,

17:48.401 --> 17:49.902
Kevin told me
that he didn't like cats.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.239
Okay, that -- that -- that
is not true, Tom, all right?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.807
I am a cat person.
Everybody says it
all the time.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.909
I don't know why he would
pick now to lie on live TV.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.579
Not very hero-like.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.013
I thought you were gonna
let this go.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.216
Okay, look, I saved a person,
all right? You saved a cat.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.517
I mean, Kelly [Laughs]
am I crazy? I mean --

18:04.584 --> 18:06.186
Face it --
Nobody cares what you did.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.920
Okay. Yeah, I know
somebodywho cares.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.889
Here. Hold these things,
would you, please?

18:11.324 --> 18:12.559
"No one cares."

18:12.625 --> 18:14.594
Who you calling? Mom?
No! I'm not. Okay?

18:14.661 --> 18:17.397
I'm calling the one man
still lucky enough to
be alive because of me.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.532
Everybody, hold on
to your heart strings,

18:19.599 --> 18:23.436
'cause they're about
to get tugged -- hard.

[ Laughs ]
Okay, sure. O-Okay.
Remember what happened?

18:47.394 --> 18:49.396
I was at the bar, I was eating
a handful of snack mix,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.364
and I guess --
really wasn't chewing --
