00:02.583 --> 00:03.875
I don't know
about you guys,

00:03.959 --> 00:05.667
but I can't just get
right back in the car

00:05.750 --> 00:07.000
after a "Law & Order"
Fest.

00:07.083 --> 00:09.083
Too much adrenaline.
Let's download.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.250
Best and worst.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.500
Best --
meeting Bobby the Body,

00:12.583 --> 00:15.291
the guy who played
19 different murder victims.

00:15.375 --> 00:17.041
Worst --
finding out one of them

00:17.125 --> 00:20.000
was the cocktail waitress
I so publicly gushed over.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.750
Wrong!
Trick question.

00:22.834 --> 00:25.083
"Law & Order" Fest
has no worst thing.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.875
It's all best.
Hayley, best?

00:26.959 --> 00:28.375
I met Ice-T.

00:28.458 --> 00:30.208
Ooh! Great best.
And best?

00:30.291 --> 00:32.542
Well, Ice-T and I bonded
while waiting in line

00:32.625 --> 00:35.208
for a Pulled Pork
from the Headlines sandwich.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.959
Wrong!
That's still just meeting Ice-T.

00:38.041 --> 00:40.208
That's one thing.
-Well, we really connected.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.000
I told him about my passion
for women's rights,

00:43.083 --> 00:45.291
and he confided in me
that he's really good at sex.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.500
You wasted your fest.
Check out what I got.

00:47.583 --> 00:50.792
A poster of every actor who
played a judge on the show,

00:50.875 --> 00:52.166
signed
by the three of them

00:52.250 --> 00:53.917
who now work
at the convention center.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.375
That's just
one thing, too.

00:55.458 --> 00:57.667
Of the 87 things
I did.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.959
88 if you count
stealing the clarinet

01:00.041 --> 01:02.458
played in the opening credits,
which I do.

01:04.458 --> 01:08.208
I heard it!
Play it again, you coward!

01:08.291 --> 01:10.417
I'm not a coward,
Francine.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.542
Then let's blow it together,

about the Census?

I think Steve has forgotten
what the "Stensus" even is.

02:31.166 --> 02:32.583
Oh, boy.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.583
Well, do you want to explain
it to him, or should I?

02:34.667 --> 02:38.083
You better do it, Stan.
I'm too upset with this one.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.834
Every 10 years,
America takes off its shirt

02:40.917 --> 02:44.625
and flexes its muscles to show
the world how swole it is.

02:44.709 --> 02:47.291
Stan, Hayley seems
a bit confused.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.458
Let's step that out
a bit for her.

02:49.542 --> 02:52.417
The Census is about counting how
many people live in America.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
The number
of people, Hayley.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.542
The United States has
the biggest population

02:56.625 --> 02:58.291
of any country
in the Western world.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.208
The Western world, Hayley.
Look it up.

03:01.291 --> 03:04.625
And every 10 years,
we find out how big we are.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.333
Then we rub it
in everyone's face.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.625
Stan, you seem really
passionate.

03:08.709 --> 03:10.500
You're reading me correctly,
Francine.

03:10.583 --> 03:13.333
So you probably already realize
I'm gonna be an enumerator.

03:13.417 --> 03:15.542
Oh, those are the people
that go door to door

03:15.625 --> 03:16.875
and do the counting, right?

03:16.959 --> 03:20.083
People? No!
They're heroes, patriots.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.375
Enumerators are
the best of the best,

03:22.458 --> 03:24.542
the only ones who truly
earn the right

03:24.625 --> 03:26.291
to call themselves
"top gun."

03:26.375 --> 03:28.458
Okay, but to be clear,
this is a job, right?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.041
Because I could use a job.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.834
Yeah, it's a job for motivated
individuals like myself.

03:33.917 --> 03:36.250
Not for lazy Hayleys
like you.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.375
You spent six hours
at a "Law & Order" Fest

03:38.458 --> 03:40.709
and only counted one person --
Ice-T.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.375
I wasn't trying
to count people.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.333
"I wasn't trying
to count people."

03:44.417 --> 03:46.333
Do you think that's something
an enumerator

03:46.417 --> 03:47.875
has ever said
in their life? No!

03:47.959 --> 03:49.291
All right, Dadders,

03:49.375 --> 03:51.625
we learned a lot of stuff
in this scene.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.542
I hope you were taking
detailed notes

03:53.625 --> 03:55.291

03:55.375 --> 03:58.125
Who is excited
about counting people?

Is it "A," Stan,

"B," the mom,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.417
"C," little glasses guy,

You're making me turn shy.

I'm just trying to pass
through the living room.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.500
Sorry, but I've been looking
at everything differently

04:33.583 --> 04:36.375
since my uncle died and left me
his Hasselblad camera.

04:36.458 --> 04:40.458
Would you be interested
in modeling for me?

04:40.542 --> 04:43.375
Modeling for you?
I don't know.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.417
It was
my only uncle, Steve.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.583
And the odds of my grandparents
crapping out a new uncle

04:48.667 --> 04:50.417
are pretty low
at this point.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.458
Do you think I could just take
a few shots of you

04:53.542 --> 04:54.667
with his camera?

04:54.750 --> 04:56.291
I guess.

Great!
Snot and the boys are also in.

Or model airplanes.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.583
Do you see this, Jurgen?

09:34.667 --> 09:36.125
Yeah.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.875
Uh, you know what?
Everyone get out. Take five.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.583
Finally.
Thank you.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.041
-Except Barry.
-Wait, what?

09:42.125 --> 09:44.375
All non-essentials
please clear frame.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.583
Now, Barry, do you know what
"Barry" is short for?

09:49.667 --> 09:51.709
Barracuda, baby!

09:51.792 --> 09:54.250
Now bite me like the scary fish
you are!

09:56.834 --> 09:59.333
Okay, we're gonna run
a little training exercise

09:59.417 --> 10:01.166
to learn how
to fill out forms.

10:01.250 --> 10:05.125
Hayley, why don't you knock
on this citizen's door?

10:05.208 --> 10:06.667
Knock, knock.

10:06.750 --> 10:10.250
There's someone at your door,
Mr. Taffarelli.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.959
But I don't know
who it is.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.041
Maybe
look who it is.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.291
It's a girl.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.834
I'm gonna slide some taffy
through the doggy door.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.792
Enough!

10:23.458 --> 10:24.875
One!

10:24.959 --> 10:27.166
That's how you count people.
Training's over.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.125
Initiate people-counting robot.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.500
No count Jim.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.917
Jim equals subhuman garbage.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.333
Lighten up, Jim.
Just a robot joke.

10:36.417 --> 10:38.458
You should be dead, Jim.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.333
How many people
live here?

10:42.417 --> 10:44.083
-Me and my mom.
-So two.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.166
-My dad...
-Three.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.333
-...died.
-Two.

10:46.417 --> 10:48.083
You wasted my time
a little bit.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.542
Hi, I'm with
the U.S. Census.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.375
I just need a brief moment
of your time.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.834
Of course.
Come on in.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.750
I was just about
to make some tea.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.000
I really can't.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.667
I have a lot of houses
to get to.

10:58.750 --> 11:02.041
I have some ancient Clamatos
I've been saving.

11:03.208 --> 11:07.041
My name...is Wilbur.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.291
Kentucky.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.208
Roger?

11:13.291 --> 11:16.750
Wow. You're really packing away
this Clamato.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.583
Oh, yeah.
So, it's just you

11:18.667 --> 11:20.792
living in this beautiful
old house?

11:20.875 --> 11:23.333
Yep.
Lived here 40 years.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.750
Seen a lot of people
come and go.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.875
You know,
I could use some help.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.333
I knocked on the house two doors
down, but no one answered.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.458
Oh, that's
Shelly Vernicheck.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.041
Sad, really.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.792
Husband up and left her
years ago.

11:36.875 --> 11:41.375
Now she sits at home
playing solitaire on her iPad.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.792
She's internationally
ranked

11:43.875 --> 11:47.709
as one of the loneliest women
in the world.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.417
Biscotti?

11:51.291 --> 11:53.041
Oh, hey, Hayley.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.917
Quick update.
I'm just leaving my 15th house.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.542
Probably a record --
Googled it.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.709
But seems like people might not
be keeping records,

11:59.792 --> 12:02.291
but safe to say my pace
is historic.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.875
Wow, that's a lot.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.709
I spent all morning
at one house.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.291
Ha! No surprise.

12:08.375 --> 12:12.166
My slug of a daughter slowly
sliming her way around town.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.834
-Where...
-Don't touch salt.

12:13.917 --> 12:16.500
...I met a nice woman
named Phyllis

12:16.583 --> 12:18.792
who gave me
20 other houses.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.500
Whoa!
That house looks cool.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.917
Cool because
I haven't counted it yet.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.417
I'ma count a bunch
of mother in here.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.166
Stan Smith, Census enumerator.
Prepare to be counted.

12:50.667 --> 12:51.875
Hey, Mr. Tuttle.

12:51.959 --> 12:53.250
Here are my forms
from yesterday.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.750
I got 25 houses.

12:54.834 --> 12:58.583
25? Wow!
That's the best anybody did.

12:58.667 --> 12:59.667
So I beat my dad?

12:59.750 --> 13:02.542
Yeah.
By 25, to be exact.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.166
I'm being playful.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.166
He didn't turn anything in.
Never even came back.

13:06.250 --> 13:09.333
And he wasn't at home.
Weird.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.125
What's weird is that I've been
rocking in the corner

13:11.208 --> 13:13.917
for 6 hours and no one's said
a word to me.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.750
Well, when we try
to talk to you,

13:15.834 --> 13:18.500
you just start screaming and
punching yourself in the --

13:23.500 --> 13:25.375
Where am I?

13:25.458 --> 13:27.500
In the pit!

13:27.583 --> 13:28.667
Are we prisoners here?

13:28.750 --> 13:30.333
Yep!

13:34.208 --> 13:36.750
My name's Kevin!
Let me give you the tour.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.542
Okay, did you look
everywhere I looked?

13:40.625 --> 13:42.667
Then you must've seen
this handsome gent.

13:42.750 --> 13:46.083
That's Robbie, and you just
missed Rich and Carl.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.375
Robbie's grumpy
'cause we have to poop

13:48.458 --> 13:50.291
in that smaller pit
over there,

13:50.375 --> 13:54.375
but I stay positive, probably
'cause this isn't my first pit.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.792
I was imprisoned
in Madison, Indiana, once.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.458
Beautiful Craftsman,
huge porch.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.291
Of course I wasn't allowed
up on the porch,

14:01.375 --> 14:03.375
but I saw it when I was
carried out in a blanket.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.208
Who did this to you?
That would be the master.

14:06.291 --> 14:07.792
Who's the master?

14:07.875 --> 14:10.542
The master's the psycho
who just skinned Rich and Carl.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.375
Skinned?
Same way we're gonna be.

14:13.458 --> 14:17.000
Robbie, don't you realize when
you're at the bottom of a pit,

14:17.083 --> 14:19.417
there's nowhere to go -- except
for the punishment shed --

14:19.500 --> 14:20.792
but up?

14:22.792 --> 14:25.792
Yes, yes, Barry!
You're a delicious cabbage.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.083
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

14:27.166 --> 14:29.375
I want to ferment you
and make kimchi!

14:29.458 --> 14:32.959
Not to sound catty, but don't
you hate the way Barry looks?

14:33.041 --> 14:35.208
Yeah, he's our
ugliest friend, easy.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.333
I want to shred you up
real good

14:37.417 --> 14:39.583
and spread you
over some fish tacos.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.208
Is there anything
you can't be?

14:42.291 --> 14:44.291
I don't know.
A carrot?

14:44.375 --> 14:46.959
Are you kidding me?
You would be the best carrot.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.208
Steve, get out
of that carrot costume!

14:49.291 --> 14:50.959
Kiss-ass bitch.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.250
Surprised Barry
can even talk

14:53.333 --> 14:55.792
with Klaus'
in his mouth.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.667
I'm so sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for my dad.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.041
He was out late last night
working in the area,

15:01.125 --> 15:02.291
and he never came home.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.375
Never seen him before.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.542
Hmm.
Maybe your wife has?

15:05.625 --> 15:08.375
Maybe my husband has.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.750
Of course.
Could I speak with him?

15:10.834 --> 15:14.125
I wish! He just up and left me
a month ago, not even a note.

15:14.208 --> 15:17.750
God, did you have to
bring him up?!

15:17.834 --> 15:20.417
Husband just up and left.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.291
Like Shelly Vernicheck!

15:22.375 --> 15:24.125
Oh, glad you're excited.

15:24.208 --> 15:27.333
Well, every day is agony
for me!

15:27.417 --> 15:29.000
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean --

15:29.083 --> 15:31.917
Oh, don't you dare
pity me.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.625
I'll show you!
I'll find another man!

15:35.709 --> 15:38.959
I haven't even begun looking
in earnest, but guess what --

15:39.041 --> 15:41.458
Now it begins!

15:41.542 --> 15:44.333
I am going to have sex
tonight

15:44.417 --> 15:48.375
on the outdoor dance floor
at the Blue Rooster!

15:48.458 --> 15:50.917
Next to the smoking area.

15:52.709 --> 15:55.000
I'm back, baby!

15:55.083 --> 15:58.333
♪♪

15:58.417 --> 16:01.750
♪♪

16:01.834 --> 16:04.375
It's not just Shelly Vernicheck.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.709
Lots of the women, and men,

16:06.792 --> 16:09.208
I talked to have had
their husbands go missing.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.291
I did think it was strange
when Jasper left.

16:14.375 --> 16:15.875
We were best friends.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.667
I thought he would've
at least left a note.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.250
Ma'am, ma'am?

16:19.333 --> 16:21.458
You know, you should talk
to Darlene McKinnon.

16:21.542 --> 16:23.125
Same thing
happened to her.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.875
Man, first Jasper,
now this.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.458
The hits
just keep on coming.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.250
Yeah, that S.O.B.
up and left me, so what?

16:34.333 --> 16:36.834
Just gives me more time
to golf anyway.

16:36.917 --> 16:40.000
I'm a lady golfer.
That is what I enjoy doing.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.500
By the way, same thing happened
to my buddy Joanne Graves.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.625
She lives
at 20 Poplar Avenue.

16:45.709 --> 16:49.542
Usually gets home
around, uh, 2:46 P.M.

16:54.208 --> 16:55.834
-Excuse me.
-Aah!

16:55.917 --> 16:57.041
Did your husband
leave you?

16:57.125 --> 16:58.875
Yes, why?
Do you know something?

16:58.959 --> 17:00.417
Have you heard
from him?!

17:00.500 --> 17:03.250
Sorry, I can't talk.
I have to go put a pin in a map.

17:05.375 --> 17:09.875
There's a pattern here.
But what?

17:09.959 --> 17:11.458
Must be
a pretty special house

17:11.542 --> 17:13.834
to have all those arrows
pointing at it.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.417
You know, your father
shaves his pubic hair

17:18.500 --> 17:19.750
in the shape
of an arrow.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.750
Oh, I did it again.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.750
I said something helpful,
and I went past it.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.291
What can you tell me
about that house?

17:28.375 --> 17:29.500
Which house?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.333
That weird house
on the hill!

17:31.417 --> 17:32.875
My dad is missing,

17:32.959 --> 17:34.458
and I think it has
something to do with that house,

17:34.542 --> 17:36.208
but I knocked on the door
and no one answered,

17:36.291 --> 17:38.166
and you know everything about
the neighborhood and I just --

17:38.250 --> 17:41.125
Honey, take a breath.
Come inside, dear.

17:41.208 --> 17:46.917
I'll fix you a Clamato, and
we'll figure this out together.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.667
Phyllis, didn't you say you were
the only one living here?

17:52.750 --> 17:54.208
That's right.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.792
Then why do you have
two hats on your coat rack?

17:57.875 --> 18:01.709
And blueprints
for a man skin-suit?

18:01.792 --> 18:03.417
♪♪

18:05.041 --> 18:08.000
I can't have two hats?

18:11.583 --> 18:15.542
I feel like I've seen something
like this done before.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.166
No, no, it's all original.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.542
These are fresh ideas,
obviously, Barry.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.041
Can you lean in a little?

18:21.125 --> 18:23.667
I want to match the image
I have in my mind.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.959
What a shutter slut.

18:29.625 --> 18:30.792
You're right, Tosh.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.834
Barry is a fat,
talentless whore.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.375
But don't worry,
he's about to get his.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.667
Let's just say
I made a couple calls.

18:40.959 --> 18:44.125
Oh, no, it's Anne Geddes!
Jurgen, protect me!

18:45.750 --> 18:49.417
I smell
copyright infringement.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.583
Anne, Anne, please!

18:51.667 --> 18:54.250
We'll give you
a 10% licensing fee!

18:54.333 --> 18:55.917
Not enough!

19:02.917 --> 19:06.375
Don't hurt me, Anne Geddes!
I'm just a baby!

19:06.458 --> 19:09.250
You forgot one thing.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.417
I hate babies!

Hayley, you're awake.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.583
I'm sorry
I was so rough on you.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.500
Well, I may have gotten
a little competitive

19:39.583 --> 19:42.709
and tried to ruin
your strange love of the Census.

19:42.792 --> 19:45.500
It's not strange, and Francine
loves it more than I do.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.667
Between you and me, I think
she takes it a little too far.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.625
Well, we're together now.

19:49.709 --> 19:52.291
Yeah, dying in a pit
with a really annoying guy.

19:52.375 --> 19:53.417
Named Kevin.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.125
Oh, no, she's back.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.375
She's gonna turn my nipples
into buttons.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.917
All that time we spent
counting people

20:02.000 --> 20:05.500
we should've spent
with the people that count.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.291
Damn, that's poetic.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.500
What up, Hayley?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.834
-Ice-T?!
-Ice-T?!

20:10.917 --> 20:12.625
I got worried
when you didn't respond

20:12.709 --> 20:15.333
to an interesting text
I sent you about sharks.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.792
Used my TV detective skills
to find you,

20:17.875 --> 20:19.375
and it's a good thing, too.

20:19.458 --> 20:22.959
Sick old lady was gonna
turn you into a skin suit.

20:23.041 --> 20:25.583
Was working on a whole
skin suit wardrobe.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.667
Skin blouse, skin slacks,

20:27.750 --> 20:30.333
and a pair of skin sunglasses
she couldn't even see out of.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.709
Fly as hell, though.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.750
Tried them on after
I kicked her to death.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.166
Dad, I know
we're not competing anymore,

20:36.250 --> 20:37.583
but...my friend!

20:37.667 --> 20:39.250
I saved us!

20:39.333 --> 20:42.125
Stan, there's also
the matter of the clarinet.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.709
The clarinet, of course!

20:43.792 --> 20:45.083
So you're mainly
here for me!

20:45.166 --> 20:47.083
- I'm the hero!
- Good job, Stan!

20:47.166 --> 20:49.875
Thanks, Kevin.
Hey, Kevin, have you met Ice-T?

20:49.959 --> 20:52.083
Oh, my God, Ice-T!

20:52.166 --> 20:56.333
I just got to say "Cop Killer"
is my absolutely favorite song.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.291
It got me
through boarding school.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.208
Boarding school
is corny.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.208
Bye-bye!
See you soon.

21:05.291 --> 21:07.000
