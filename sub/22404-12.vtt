You're stuck in
my sweat tube.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.243
Your little boy toy's trapped

11:01.327 --> 11:02.745
in my enormous
gift basket...

11:02.828 --> 11:06.290
and as for your fuzzy
little co-worker...

11:06.374 --> 11:08.459
I locked him in
your stupid elevator,

11:08.542 --> 11:10.836
with no way out!

11:10.920 --> 11:12.463
- Yah...

11:12.546 --> 11:14.548
I will show you
who "can't get out"

11:14.632 --> 11:16.884
of this elevator.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.431
Daaah, that's my snack kit.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.133
- Okay, I don't get it!

11:57.216 --> 11:59.009
Henry supposedly works here,

11:59.093 --> 12:00.636
but every time
I come here to see him here,

12:00.719 --> 12:01.971
he's never around!

12:02.054 --> 12:04.974
- Your point?

12:05.057 --> 12:08.811
- Where is Henry?!?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.939
- He's...Henry...
y'know..

12:12.022 --> 12:14.150
Uh, Charlotte-- where'd
you say Henry was again?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.359
- Uhhh...
He's...

12:15.443 --> 12:18.154
stuck in the bathroom!

12:18.237 --> 12:20.406
- He's stuck
in the bathroom.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.413
- Ah!
Got it!

12:28.747 --> 12:30.833
Jasper, I got it off,
let's go!

12:30.916 --> 12:31.584
- Ooo!
- Wait! Go where?!?

12:31.667 --> 12:36.130
- Uhh...
to get Henry!

12:36.213 --> 12:38.966
Ya, we're gonna crawl
through an air shaft,

12:39.049 --> 12:40.676
so that way we can
get into the bathroom

12:40.759 --> 12:41.844
and help Henry get out.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.387
- Fine, then I'll come too.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.473
- No no no no.
- No, no, that's a bad idea.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.682
- Why can't I go?

12:46.765 --> 12:49.727
- Because uhhh...

12:49.810 --> 12:52.480
- He's naked.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.900
- Why would he be naked
in the bathroom?!?

12:55.983 --> 12:58.360
- Yeah Jasper, why?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.487
- What?

12:59.570 --> 13:03.491
You two don't know
that dudes pee naked?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.369
- Uh, I guess not.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.497
- Anyway...
you watch the store.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.539
- Watch the store?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.957
I don't know anything
about store--

13:12.041 --> 13:14.627
- Byee!!!
- Byeeeee!!!

13:16.837 --> 13:19.048
- Why pee naked?!?

13:20.716 --> 13:23.636
- Okay, you're sure
that this shaft

13:23.719 --> 13:25.179
goes all the way down
to the Man Cave?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.097
- I think so!

13:27.181 --> 13:28.724
Ready?!?

13:28.807 --> 13:32.269
- Yeah, use me
like a boogie board!

13:36.148 --> 13:37.983
- Okay...

13:38.067 --> 13:41.195

13:41.278 --> 13:43.531
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

13:49.453 --> 13:51.247
- Ahhh!!!

13:53.624 --> 13:55.960
- C'mon phone, let me in!

13:56.043 --> 13:58.295
- Face, not recognized.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.630
- No!!!

13:59.713 --> 14:01.423
- Oh, ohhh.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.886
- He he he he he.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.680
- Ahhh!

14:08.764 --> 14:14.687
- All right,
Captain Ma'am...

14:14.770 --> 14:16.605
a few swallows of this...

14:16.689 --> 14:19.608
will make me just as
indestructible as you are.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.652
For about 45 minutes.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.904
And now...

14:23.988 --> 14:25.864
- Kid!

14:25.948 --> 14:27.658
Kid...
I can't get outta here!

14:27.741 --> 14:29.159
You gotta stop him!!!!

14:29.243 --> 14:33.289
- I can't!
I can't get outta this basket!

14:33.372 --> 14:36.417
- Ah geez--I can't believe
I'm gonna drink man sweat.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.128
- Don't do it.
- Oh well...

14:39.211 --> 14:41.547
- No no no!!

14:41.630 --> 14:42.923
- No!

14:48.762 --> 14:49.346
- Oh it's so disgusting!

14:49.430 --> 14:51.932
P'tah! P'tah!

14:52.016 --> 14:56.145
- Ahhhh!

14:58.731 --> 15:00.399
- Wh...what's
that noise?!?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.526
- I...
I dunno...

15:02.610 --> 15:05.154
all I can hear
is me sweating.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.197
- Ahhhhhh!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.878
- Hiiii.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.129
- It's...us.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.173
- You guys, quick,
get outta here, get outta here!

15:24.256 --> 15:24.840
- But but but, The Toddler!

15:24.923 --> 15:26.925
- We gotta stop him!

15:27.009 --> 15:29.136
- You're too late,
he already drank my sweat.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.679
Now get outta here
before he sees your faces!

15:30.763 --> 15:31.972
- Seriously guys,
go go go go!

15:32.056 --> 15:34.767
- 'Kay Kay!
- Okay c'mon!

15:34.850 --> 15:36.143
- Oh oh!

15:36.226 --> 15:37.394
Your sister needs
you to fix her phone!

15:37.478 --> 15:39.563
- Get outta here!!!

15:43.859 --> 15:44.860
- What the heck was that?!

15:44.943 --> 15:48.364
- Uh...I think
you tripped.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.491
- Yeah.
It was hilarious.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.118
- What? No, no,
I didn't trip!

15:55.412 --> 15:59.291
- C'monnnn elevator door...

15:59.375 --> 16:00.834
- I'm the enemy.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.753
You've been enormously
argumentative today.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.380
- You're the one that's
denying what we're saying.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.422
- And if you guys talk with me,
more as human beings,

16:05.506 --> 16:07.132
we could find
some common ground.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.385
Whataver!!

16:09.468 --> 16:12.346
Now, let's see
if I'm indestructible.

16:14.848 --> 16:18.268
Owwwww!!!

16:20.729 --> 16:23.732
I'm ohhhh-kaaaaay.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.234
Get it?

16:25.317 --> 16:26.985
'Cuz that's
what you often say.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.570
- Shut up, Toddler.
- Nooo!

16:28.654 --> 16:30.572
Now, I need to do a few tests,

16:30.656 --> 16:32.032
just to make sure
I'm indestructible!

16:34.201 --> 16:37.037
Ahh!

16:37.121 --> 16:39.873
I'm ohhhh-kaaaaay.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.418

Ahhh!

Ahhh!

17:00.310 --> 17:02.312

Still okay!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.367
Well!

17:15.451 --> 17:18.619
Now it looks like I'm
an indestructible Toddler!

17:18.704 --> 17:20.830
Which means I can commit
any crime I want,

17:20.914 --> 17:23.125
and no one can stop me!

17:23.208 --> 17:24.877
