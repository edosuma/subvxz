<i>In Herman Williams'
seminal work on the joys</i>

00:48.961 --> 00:53.357

hobbyist, he writes,</i>

00:53.357 --> 00:55.403
<i>"Many an hour have I spent</i>

- Encore, Allie!

02:34.632 --> 02:36.243
- No!

02:36.243 --> 02:37.679
I am way too drunk

02:37.679 --> 02:39.202
to be singing
in front of people.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.509
Aw, but we love you! Come on!

02:41.509 --> 02:43.293
And I wanna keep it that way.

02:43.293 --> 02:47.645
Um, okay. That was
for my beautiful, sweet,

02:47.645 --> 02:49.865
darling fiance, Nathan.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.738
Who loves that song very much.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.785
Bubba, you wanna come up here?

02:56.785 --> 02:59.004
- No.

02:59.004 --> 03:01.485
Come on!
It's our engagement party.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.270
He's very shy!

03:03.270 --> 03:06.316
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!

03:06.316 --> 03:09.928
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!

03:12.279 --> 03:14.977
Mm! Ah! Mm!

03:14.977 --> 03:16.892
- Did you like it?
- It was amazing.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.026
- Hey, y'all...

03:21.026 --> 03:25.117
Um, I'll just briefly say that
she played that song for me

03:25.117 --> 03:26.728
on our very first date

03:26.728 --> 03:28.817
on a beautiful,
old piano she found

03:28.817 --> 03:30.427
at the back of an empty bar.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.690
- Well, you better go, girl!
- Come on. Come on!

03:32.690 --> 03:35.215
- Always be closing.
Absolutely!

03:35.215 --> 03:37.260
Welcome to the family!

03:37.260 --> 03:39.871
- Allison...
- Yes...

03:41.438 --> 03:46.226
Every memory I cherish
in my life has you in it.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.532
Some of them
are just tiny seconds.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.318
The way you close one eye

03:51.318 --> 03:53.755
when you really wanna focus
on tasting something.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.236
- I do that. I do that.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.498
I go, like...

04:04.331 --> 04:06.028
I can't believe this is real.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.334
It's real, baby.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.683
- Thank God.
Mm.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.250
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.252
Aw.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.731
- Okay.
- Hey...

04:15.603 --> 04:19.998
- Um... Drink, smoke, be merry.
Yeah.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.739
And if you choose
to sleep with Chip,

04:21.739 --> 04:24.568
make sure he wears,
like, 11 condoms.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.224
I'm, like, literally a virgin.

04:28.224 --> 04:31.401
- He's kidding. He's kidding.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.113
No! No, no, no.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.377
- No. Come on, baby. No phone.
- Oh.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.943
When we get married,
we have to make rules

04:51.943 --> 04:54.468
- about phones in the bed.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.034
Oh, shut up.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.255
You are on your phone,
like, ten times more than me,

04:59.255 --> 05:01.866
looking up rusty old trucks.

05:01.866 --> 05:05.870
Uh, a '67 cloth top Bronco

05:05.870 --> 05:08.699
is a work of art, baby.
It's not a truck.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.701
- I'm looking at art.
- Yeah. Oh.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.617
- Like this butt.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.316
I am so high
from that gummy you gave me.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.143
- What the fuck was that?

05:18.143 --> 05:20.102
I still can't feel my ankles.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.060
You don't need your ankles
right now.

05:22.060 --> 05:25.716
Yeah, but I would
still like to feel my ankles.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.327
Hey, come kiss me.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.806
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah?

05:28.806 --> 05:30.721
This creepy doctor
from my sales list

05:30.721 --> 05:32.810
is really trying to flirt
with me on Instagram.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.422
Maybe you
gave him the wrong impression.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.597
What?

05:36.597 --> 05:37.946
Come on! As if!

05:37.946 --> 05:40.122
I go in there, and I'm, like,

05:40.122 --> 05:42.342
waving
my engagement ring around.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.866
You always say, "Flirting
is a part of the job."

05:44.866 --> 05:46.694
Someone's bound to get
the wrong impression.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.000
It's very light flirting.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.046
- Ah, okay.
- It is!

05:51.046 --> 05:52.700
It's like... It's just...

05:52.700 --> 05:55.398
It's sushi with a smile,

05:55.398 --> 05:57.705
so that he can write
the fucking prescription,

05:58.880 --> 06:00.403
and I can get a fat bonus,

06:00.795 --> 06:01.970
and then

06:02.884 --> 06:06.714
you and I can maybe one day

06:06.714 --> 06:08.150
move to the city.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.021
If we don't go to hell first.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.676
Oh! Why would you say that?

06:12.676 --> 06:14.983
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

06:14.983 --> 06:18.421
I'm only pushing HUMIRA, like,

06:18.421 --> 06:22.947
I won't go to hell for
moderate to severe psoriasis.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.950
Come on.
That would be so unfair.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.343
Yeah, yeah.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.779
Shut up.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.390
- Okay. Hey.
- Mmm.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.565
It's just a stepping
stone, baby.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.001
I know.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.438
Do you think it's too late
for astronaut school?

06:35.438 --> 06:37.614
- What?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.137
- What?
- Nothing.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.270
I could be
a professional dancer.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.098
- Oh, word?
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.317
- You got them moves?
- Ooh.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.797
- Wait, let me stand up.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.625
I'm way better
when I stand up.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.931
- Okay.
- It's so much better

06:49.931 --> 06:51.672
when I stand up.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.325
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.591
- Whoa.
- What genre is this?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.244
I don't know,
but my body just goes...

06:59.244 --> 07:00.332
Go.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.422
Is this modern, right?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.249
- This is professional.
- Wow.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.337
So I would appreciate it

07:05.337 --> 07:06.643
if you took me seriously
right now.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.079
I'm taking you very seriously.

07:08.079 --> 07:11.518
And then, we'll finish
with something like this.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.522
But I'm not gonna
show you anymore,

07:15.522 --> 07:17.393
because it's
a work-in-progress.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.613
And the professional is tired,

07:19.613 --> 07:22.093
and I wanna cuddle.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.731

07:50.731 --> 07:52.080
- She's a work-in-progress.
- Never.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.306
Yeah, the varsity coach said
she might start next year.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.394
- Oh, yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.701
She scored 19 goals
last season!

08:04.701 --> 08:05.963
- Tell her. Tell her.
- Wow!

08:05.963 --> 08:08.400
Oh, my God.
You must be so proud of her.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.532
I can't believe
I haven't met her.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.707
I'm so sorry Nathan and I

08:10.707 --> 08:12.056
haven't made it
down there yet.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.536
Don't worry about it.
I mean, it's far.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.755
We're gonna try to come up
more often

08:14.755 --> 08:16.060
now that our dad's
getting older.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.845
Yeah.

08:17.845 --> 08:21.239
Well, I've only met
your dad a few times,

08:21.239 --> 08:23.546
but that we can't blame
on distance.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.463
This is fucking nuts.
I'm sorry.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.638
Wait, so tell us about

08:28.638 --> 08:30.335
these wedding dresses
we're seeing.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.076
Yes, please. I couldn't sleep
last night thinking about it.

08:32.076 --> 08:34.426
Shut up!
- You are such a good sport.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.212
No, he isn't. He just thinks
that after we see dresses,

08:37.212 --> 08:38.561
- we're going to go...
- Yeah?

08:38.561 --> 08:39.736
- ...on a pub crawl.
Mmm-hmm.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.172
But actually
we're going to see a play.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.609
- You are?
- No, we're not.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.175
You said that we'd have
to get tickets already.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.221
No. We just gotta see some
shit nobody else wants to see.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.614
- Oh, great. That's awesome.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.006
- Yeah, right?
- Great. Great.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.008
Hey, look,
it's finally opening up.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.445
All right, so I think
it might be a little tight

08:53.445 --> 08:54.969
getting you to a play,

08:54.969 --> 08:58.494
but, um, let me just check...

09:01.366 --> 09:02.977
- Okay, so now it's saying...

09:02.977 --> 09:04.239
Allie!

09:04.239 --> 09:05.414
Look out!

09:20.647 --> 09:22.126
Here we are.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.520
You got me here so early.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.653
Yeah, well, it's

09:26.653 --> 09:29.090
better to be a half-hour early

09:29.090 --> 09:30.657
than one minute late.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.530
Grandpa, have you ever played
any video games?

09:34.530 --> 09:36.314
- No.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.927
You've got that perfect
little brain up there

09:39.927 --> 09:42.538
and you're just melting it
away with that crap.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.584
Okay.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.802
<i>Nathan.
-</i>

09:45.802 --> 09:47.021
It's Uncle Nathan.
Answer it.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.371
Why would he be calling me?

09:50.764 --> 09:51.808
Pick it up.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.599
Thought we weren't
talking anymore.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.787
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Nathan. Nathan.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.267
I've... I've got
Ryan here in the car.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.052
I'm just dropping her off
at school.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.401
I'll call you right back.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.928
Yes, I heard what you said.
I'm headed right there.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.843
I just gotta
drop her off, okay?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.935
See, that wasn't so bad.

10:31.935 --> 10:34.416
Mom says she wishes you guys
could find a way to get along.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.028
I... I've...
I've got to leave, sweetie.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.117
But I look like a dork
being here this early.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.553
I'm sorry.

10:42.467 --> 10:43.468
I'll, uh...

10:44.295 --> 10:46.254
I'll be picking you up today.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.777
Why can't Mom?

10:47.777 --> 10:49.170
She said they'd be back
from the city today, right?

10:50.388 --> 10:51.520
Well...

10:53.565 --> 10:55.132
- she can't.
Okay.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.307
I'll text her.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.613
Okay.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.093
Okay. Bye.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.269
Tell me you love me.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.620
I love you, Grandpa.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.056
I love you too.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.104
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:31.473 --> 11:34.476
Mom,
my head hurts so much.

11:34.476 --> 11:37.871
I can't even explain
how much pain my head's in.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.394
Can you click
on the morphine again?

11:39.394 --> 11:40.830
I've been clicking on it.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.006
I'm clicking on it,
and nothing is happening.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.312
Oh, shoot, you're right.
It is empty.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.661
We gotta get more.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.967
We'll have to get the nurse
to get us more.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.185
Nathan, why are you
looking at me like that?

11:48.664 --> 11:50.361
Like what?

11:50.361 --> 11:52.320
Is it bad? Do I look that bad?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.669
No, he's just upset, sweetheart.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.149
He's upset 'cause we've been

11:55.149 --> 11:56.628
- so worried all night long.
Okay. Okay.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.718
This backhoe thing
just reversed

11:58.718 --> 12:00.589
into the middle of the street.

12:00.589 --> 12:01.721
I know, I know.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.374
I didn't know
what to do.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.636
I know, but you don't have to
worry about that right now.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.160
- Right, Nathan?
- Yeah.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.683
No, you just need to focus
on getting better.

12:07.683 --> 12:08.771
That's all you need
to think about, okay?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.425
Okay.
- Right, Nathan?

12:10.425 --> 12:12.079
- Yeah.
Sorry to interrupt,

12:12.079 --> 12:13.733
but the police are here
to collect a blood sample.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.082
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.736
Now is not a good time.
She is in a lot of pain.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.302
- You have to come back.
- No.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.087
She just woke up.
- Why are the police here?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.697
Unfortunately, I can't.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.047
Legally, the sample has to be
drawn as soon as possible.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.483
We waited for her
to stabilize,

12:25.483 --> 12:26.571
but with an accident
like this,

12:26.571 --> 12:27.964
it's imperative we test...

12:27.964 --> 12:29.705
What is he talking about?
It wasn't my fault.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.012
- Officer, she doesn't know.
- It wasn't her fault.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.317
With an accident
of this magnitude

12:33.317 --> 12:34.754
involving fatalities,
we're required...

12:34.754 --> 12:36.494
- She hasn't been told.
- Fatalities?

12:36.494 --> 12:37.800
She hasn't been told,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.193
- you fucking asshole!
Fuck.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.064
She didn't know.
- Mama, what's going on?

12:41.064 --> 12:42.326
- I'm so sorry, honey.
- What is he talking about?

12:42.326 --> 12:43.458
I'm so sorry.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.199
Nathan?

12:45.199 --> 12:46.809
Nathan, what's going on?

12:50.682 --> 12:51.945
They're gone.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.600
They're both gone.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.211
Who's gone?

12:57.211 --> 12:58.429
Honey...

13:14.054 --> 13:16.621
No, Mom.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.843
Why, Mom?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.932
I'm so sorry, honey.

15:16.263 --> 15:20.006
You have got to stop buying
all this crap.

15:21.659 --> 15:25.185
Yeah, well, one of them
is an acrylic nail set

15:25.185 --> 15:27.578
that I know you'll appreciate
more than I will.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.971
And the others
are ankle weights.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.973

gonna get in shape?

15:31.887 --> 15:33.454
Oh, my God.

Allie, what the hell

15:36.500 --> 15:37.980
What? It's makeover Monday.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.983
- It's Friday.
- Oh.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.029
- It's so dark in here.
- No, please, don't open that.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.421
Mama, that is so bright!

15:44.421 --> 15:46.467
Did you go
to physical therapy today?

15:46.467 --> 15:48.425
Um, well, I tried to,

15:48.425 --> 15:50.471
- but I overslept.
- Allie...

15:50.471 --> 15:52.864
What? I don't need PT.
I don't.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.257
Allie, your hair.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.607
You don't like it?

15:56.607 --> 15:58.740
I just don't understand why
you would cut your own hair.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.090
Well, the girl said
it was easy, and it was not.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.483
What girl?

16:02.483 --> 16:05.877
This girl on the Internet.
She's an influencer.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.705
She influenced me.

16:07.705 --> 16:12.058
Such a pigsty in here.
I am not happy about this.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.885
Hey, Mama, can you tell me
where my pills are?

16:13.885 --> 16:16.366
Which ones?

16:16.366 --> 16:20.022
We said we were going to
wean off of them. Remember?

16:20.022 --> 16:21.981
- Did we?
- Yes.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.722
Because "we" are in pain

16:24.722 --> 16:26.594
and "we" need more.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.943
They're not gonna
give you more, Allie.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.379
- They have to!
- No, they don't.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.902
I need them!

16:30.902 --> 16:32.513
Listen to me.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.645
You're not in physical pain anymore.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.778
Have you been doing
the tapping thing

16:36.778 --> 16:38.171
that that one shrink
taught you?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.390
Remember?
For anxiety and stress,

16:40.390 --> 16:42.218
and it calms you down
on the...

16:42.218 --> 16:43.915
- eyes, and then the lips.
- Mom!

16:43.915 --> 16:45.613
Or play your piano.
That always cheers you up.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.962
I don't wanna talk
about this, please.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.791
I have the worst headache!
Can you just stop?

16:49.791 --> 16:52.707
Can you call the doctors
and help me, please?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.491
Which one? Patel?
He said no more.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.841
Okay, well, fuck Patel.
Fuck Patel!

16:56.841 --> 16:58.626
How about Goldberg, or...

16:58.626 --> 17:00.497
or Fong?

17:00.497 --> 17:02.108
- Allie...
- Please, Mom.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.283
- Just call 'em. Just help me.
- You're being a little...

17:03.283 --> 17:04.675
- No.
- Just help me, please.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.286
Guess what?
They all said "no."

17:06.286 --> 17:08.331
Patel. Goldberg.
Fong. Rosenberg.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.246
Okay, well, I'll try Vromen.
He loves me.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.161
Vromen is an orthodontist.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.641
Yeah, but he used to
flirt with me

17:13.641 --> 17:15.730
when his fingers were really
deep inside my mouth,

17:15.730 --> 17:18.254
and it was very inappropriate,
and so, he really owes me one.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.126
Allie, I don't like
how you're acting.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.344
You know what?
Enough is enough.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.129
You gotta get out
of this living room,

17:23.129 --> 17:24.739
take off your pajamas,

17:24.739 --> 17:26.654
and get your ass,
and go get a job.

17:26.654 --> 17:27.785
I'm sick of this crap.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.092
As if you have any right

17:30.092 --> 17:32.181
lecturing me
on medicating myself.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.574
What is that supposed to mean?

17:33.574 --> 17:36.751
It means, Mom, you're such
a fucking hypocrite!

17:36.751 --> 17:39.580
You don't think that I clock
how many Xanax you take?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.756
Or how many glasses of wine
you drink?

17:41.756 --> 17:43.758
You think I'm just a zombie
that doesn't notice anything,

17:43.758 --> 17:46.456
but I notice
fucking everything! I see you.

17:46.456 --> 17:50.069
So, can I have my pills, please?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.288
You're not listening.
There's no more.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.428
You get
right back here,

18:01.428 --> 18:03.038
- you little brat!
- No!

18:03.038 --> 18:05.475
What in the hell do you think
you are doing?

18:05.475 --> 18:06.737
Get out of there!

18:06.737 --> 18:07.912
- Get out of there!
Get off me!

18:07.912 --> 18:09.392
- No! Get out of there!
- Let go!

18:09.392 --> 18:11.655
What are you doing?
- No! Are they in here?

18:11.655 --> 18:14.441
Get back! Cut it out!
- You are hurting me!

18:14.441 --> 18:15.790
Stop it!

18:15.790 --> 18:17.574
- Stop it! Put that back!
Mom!

18:18.662 --> 18:19.707
No.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.143
- Open the door.
- No.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.753
- Open the fucking door!
- Stop it! Stop it.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.103
- Mom, let me out.
- No.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.279
Let me out. Let me out!

18:26.279 --> 18:27.541
Mama!

18:27.541 --> 18:29.325
- No! Stop it!
- Give me those... Ow.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.501
- Stop it!
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.634
- You fucking crazy little brat.
No!

18:36.245 --> 18:38.204
Shit!

18:38.204 --> 18:40.510
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.512
Mama, no! Please. No!

18:44.688 --> 18:46.734
Why the fuck did you do that?

18:46.734 --> 18:47.909
I'm in pain!

18:47.909 --> 18:49.040
I don't give a shit!

18:49.040 --> 18:50.520
Your daughter
is in actual pain!

18:50.520 --> 18:51.956
I don't give a shit!

18:51.956 --> 18:55.525
I fucking hate you so much!

18:55.525 --> 18:57.179
You're bleeding!

19:01.357 --> 19:02.706
You get back here right now.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.143
Leave me alone.
- You come back here.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.231
Leave me alone.
- I'm gonna grab your...

19:06.536 --> 19:07.885
Leave me the fuck alone!

19:07.885 --> 19:09.060
I'm not gonna leave you
the fuck alone,

19:09.060 --> 19:10.236
- you little brat.
- Ugh!

19:15.937 --> 19:17.286
Allison!

19:17.286 --> 19:19.419
- Leave me alone!
Where are you going?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.290
Leave me alone!

19:32.519 --> 19:34.303
Let's go, Ryan!

19:35.609 --> 19:37.437
Attagirl! Attagirl!

19:44.095 --> 19:46.097
Fuck!

19:46.097 --> 19:47.838
So you're the Ryan
that's been talking to Damien?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.100
Get the fuck outta my face.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.319
See, you talk to people
like that, bitch,

19:50.319 --> 19:51.842
that's why you have
no fucking friends.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.017
Why are you
hitting on me, huh?

19:53.017 --> 19:54.497
Uh, I'm not the one
named "Ryan."

19:54.497 --> 19:56.238
It's a fucking dyke's name.
You a dyke?

19:56.238 --> 19:59.154
- Only when I fuck your mother.
- Oh, at least I have a mother.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.159
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

20:04.899 --> 20:06.161
Hey!

20:06.161 --> 20:09.425
Stay away from Damien,
you fucking whore.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.427
Hey!

20:11.427 --> 20:13.386
Break that up, Ref!

20:14.778 --> 20:15.866
Break it up.
Break it up!

20:16.171 --> 20:17.216
Hey!

20:19.827 --> 20:22.873
Hey! That's it!
You're both out. Red card.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.266
Ryan,
what the hell was that?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.746
I quit.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.052
I quit.
I hate this fucking game.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.098
Why? Because you got
in a fight?

20:30.098 --> 20:32.143
Come on, that's not you.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.276
You're tough.
You're not a quitter.

20:34.276 --> 20:37.323
- She made fun of Mom.
- What?

20:37.323 --> 20:39.499
She said,
"At least I have a mom."

20:42.284 --> 20:43.851
Well, fuck her.

20:47.550 --> 20:48.638
Well...

20:49.987 --> 20:52.425
And what kind of a punch
was that?

20:52.425 --> 20:54.688
You throw this hard right hook

20:54.688 --> 20:57.343
and then you leave yourself
wide open for the jab.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.128
We're gonna have to work
on that.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.016
Hi.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.584
I'm here to get
a prescription refilled.

21:21.584 --> 21:24.413
Last name, Johnson.
Birthday, August 24th.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.372
Okay. For which medication?

21:26.372 --> 21:29.505
Uh... The Oxy. OxyContin.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.681
It says here
you are out of refills.

21:31.681 --> 21:34.293
I see you've been on them
for over a year now.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.382
Your doctor's probably trying
to wean you off of them.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.775
As I'm sure you know,
they can be very addictive.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.647
Oh, really?
I hadn't fucking heard that.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.650
Sorry.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.391
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.307
Listen...

21:48.307 --> 21:50.221
I was in a really bad
car accident,

21:50.221 --> 21:53.312
and I need them,
because I'm in a lot of pain.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.356
Just now?

21:55.575 --> 21:56.706
What? No.

21:56.706 --> 21:59.274
Your elbow is bleeding.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.058
Oh, shit.
Look, it's fine.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.582
Let me go get you a bandage.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.453
I don't need
a fucking bandage. It's fine.

22:08.718 --> 22:09.806
Then take this.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.811
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.773
I feel so much better now.
Thank you.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.644
Fucking bitch.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.875
<i>Burn,
but guess what that burn is?</i>

22:34.875 --> 22:37.965
<i>That burn is in your soul.
It is lifting you up.</i>

22:37.965 --> 22:39.401
<i>You are climbing that mountain</i>

22:39.401 --> 22:41.316
<i>and you are reaching
higher heights</i>

22:41.316 --> 22:42.970
<i>than you ever have before.</i>

22:42.970 --> 22:44.319
<i>Keep pedaling.</i>

24:20.197 --> 24:22.417
Hi.
- Hi!

24:22.417 --> 24:24.245
- Hey!
- Hi!

24:25.376 --> 24:26.508
Hi.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.119
Oh, my God. I love your hair!

24:29.119 --> 24:32.775
- It is so chic. Who did it?
- Ah, thank you! Um...

24:32.775 --> 24:35.386
I, uh, got a new gal.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.954
Well, I gotta get her number.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.390
Okay.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.350
Oh, I was so happy
that you reached out.

24:42.350 --> 24:45.309
Because you weren't responding
to any of my texts.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.181
Of course, I wanted
to give you your space,

24:47.181 --> 24:48.878
but I was worried.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.358
Hi, good morning.
- Hey!

24:50.358 --> 24:51.664
Can I get you anything?

24:51.664 --> 24:54.536
Uh, yeah. Can I please get
a Jack and Coke?

24:55.058 --> 24:57.060
Uh...

24:57.060 --> 24:59.498
Sorry, our bar doesn't
actually open until 11:00.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.847
Oh.

25:00.847 --> 25:04.328
Uh, okay. In that case,
I'll get a black coffee.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.113
- Oat milk latte.
- You got it.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.814
So, how's, how's work?

25:11.814 --> 25:12.989
You're still at Purdue, right?

25:12.989 --> 25:14.556
- Still repping Purdue.
- Yeah.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.949
You'd think it would've been
a shit show

25:15.949 --> 25:17.777
because of the bankruptcy
and all the lawsuits.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.648
- Mm.
- But, between you and me,

25:19.648 --> 25:21.520
my numbers
have actually increased.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.782
Wow.

25:22.782 --> 25:26.133
My bonus last quarter
was insane.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.309
- It sells itself.
- Yeah.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.528
Karl Marx was wrong.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.660
Turns out
the opiate of the masses

25:31.660 --> 25:32.748
is opium.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.667
Anyway.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.929
How are you doing?

25:39.929 --> 25:41.452
When are you going back
to work?

25:41.452 --> 25:42.802
Listen,
I'm just gonna cut right to it

25:42.802 --> 25:43.890
because you're my friend

25:43.890 --> 25:45.892
and I know
you're gonna understand.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.067
Um...

25:48.198 --> 25:50.810
I'm still in a lot of pain.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.333
Oh, Allie...

25:52.333 --> 25:56.467
I know, and my docs
are cutting my Oxy scripts

25:56.467 --> 25:58.731
because everyone's
really freaked out

25:58.731 --> 26:00.210
about addiction these days.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.038
Uh...

26:02.038 --> 26:04.737
So, I was wondering
if it would be possible...

26:04.737 --> 26:06.608
Allie, please tell me
you didn't invite me

26:06.608 --> 26:08.871
to breakfast
to hit me up for pills.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.394
No.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.396
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.616
It's just until I can get in,
and see my docs.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.792
Um, because my fucking mother,

26:16.792 --> 26:19.578
she threw my last refill
into the toilet, so...

26:19.969 --> 26:21.623
No way.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.320
Are you fucking
with me right now?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.800
No.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.802
If you have a problem,
you need to get some help.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.239
I can help you
find the right rehab.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.285
Please don't hand me
a pamphlet.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.808
I already have one.

26:32.808 --> 26:35.115
Well, then find them
on the street if you have to.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.160
Every dive bar
in this town's got a guy

26:37.160 --> 26:39.336
with a pharmacy
in his front pocket.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.208
You know, Becka,

26:42.470 --> 26:44.559
I really didn't want
to do this.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.431
But...

26:49.390 --> 26:50.826
there's a handful of things

26:50.826 --> 26:54.090
that happened
at your bachelorette party

26:54.090 --> 26:57.659
that I'm pretty sure
you want to be kept private.

26:57.659 --> 27:01.315
Allison, are you trying
to blackmail me for OxyContin?

27:01.315 --> 27:03.143
I'm just asking you for help.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.494
Like, as a friend.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.498
But you did blow that dancer.

27:11.455 --> 27:12.718
It happened for a second.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.851
I know, I know.
But you did it, and I saw.

27:16.852 --> 27:17.940
It never went in my mouth.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.509
It was in your mouth.

27:21.509 --> 27:22.771
Past the tip.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.253
Past the fucking tip.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.647
Allie, you need help.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.475
Destroy my life
if you have to.

27:31.475 --> 27:35.088
But for the love of God,
get some fucking help!

27:35.088 --> 27:36.567
Okay, bye.
Fuck you.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.004
Fuck you!

27:43.923 --> 27:46.229
Uh... I don't...
Oh, fuck.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.320
I don't have any money.
I'm really sorry.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.670
I can't pay for those.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.150
That's okay. Take it.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.065
I mixed in a little tequila
for you.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.032
That's disgusting.

28:07.555 --> 28:08.556
Thank you.

28:11.646 --> 28:14.431
<i>Mr. Adams,
we really wanna do</i>

28:14.431 --> 28:16.607
<i>everything we can
to help Ryan.</i>

28:18.871 --> 28:20.481
But she needs to take
some responsibility

28:20.481 --> 28:22.483
for her behavior.

28:22.483 --> 28:25.573
That girl does not listen
to a thing I say.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.707
To be honest,

28:28.707 --> 28:30.447
I was hoping
you were calling me in here

28:30.447 --> 28:32.145
to give me some advice.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.714
I need help.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.716
It's just that
we're a public school.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.631
We have 2,000 kids
to look after.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.198
We don't have the bandwidth

28:42.198 --> 28:44.853
to micromanage her in ways
that she deserves and needs.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.594
So, what are you saying?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.292
I will give her
an extra strike

28:49.292 --> 28:51.730
because of the circumstances.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.383
But if she doesn't tone down
her language

28:53.383 --> 28:55.037
with her teachers

28:55.037 --> 28:56.909
and gets into one more fight,

28:57.866 --> 28:59.215
we'll have to expel her.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.762
Hi, can I get
a double tequila, please?

29:31.726 --> 29:32.727
Allison.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.774
Yo, I know you.

29:36.905 --> 29:37.906
It's Mark.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.039
Yeah, hey.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.910
Yeah.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.565
I haven't seen you
since high school.

29:44.565 --> 29:47.002
This is Diego.
You remember Diego?

29:47.002 --> 29:48.177
- Hey.
Hey.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.006
You just having
a little breakfast?

29:51.006 --> 29:53.792
Uh... Um... I just...

29:55.402 --> 29:57.317
I just needed
to get out of the house.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.406
Yeah, I feel that.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.843
I heard what happened to you.
The accident.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.018
Saw it in the <i>Star Ledger.</i> Sorry.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.454
What happened?

30:04.454 --> 30:05.673
She was in that
accident on the turnpike.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.240
Two people died.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.807
Holy shit.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.244
That was you.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.203
Oh, bro.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.162
That would've fucked me up.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.380
It wasn't my fault.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.992
Yeah, I'm sure.
But, like, still...

30:25.867 --> 30:26.825
Damn.

30:30.263 --> 30:33.266
Hey, can I
have another one, please?

30:34.571 --> 30:35.746
You having a tough day?

30:36.965 --> 30:38.314
Just a day.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.014
I just wanna get as far away
from here as possible.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.363
Yo, there's this app,

30:43.363 --> 30:44.755
it tells you
the exact opposite

30:44.755 --> 30:46.670
of where you are
on the globe is.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.759
That's where you should go.
I'll look it up for you.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.327
Yo, that's how I feel
every fuckin' day of my life.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.764
I can't seem to escape
this town.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.418
It's like there's
a force field around it

30:55.418 --> 30:57.072
or something.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.770
Like, some people know
how to get outta here.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.294
But the rest of us,

31:01.294 --> 31:03.035
we just keep banging our heads
up against the glass.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.211
It's Perth. That's the city

31:05.211 --> 31:07.082
on the other side of the globe
from here.

31:07.082 --> 31:08.954
You should go to Perth.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.521
I don't have enough money
to get to Perth,

31:11.521 --> 31:13.001
but thank you.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.960
Aren't you engaged
to Nathan Adams?

31:16.178 --> 31:18.137
I was, yeah.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.704
He was an amazing running back
in high school.

31:20.704 --> 31:21.880
He used to run
every fucking play.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.011
- You remember him, Mark?
Yeah.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.143
Every fucking play,

31:24.143 --> 31:25.753
they'd come
on the PA system like,

31:25.753 --> 31:29.365
"Nathan Adams,
the ball carrier."

31:29.365 --> 31:31.324
He was the whole fucking team.
You remember him, Mark?

31:31.324 --> 31:33.195
Yeah, I remember him.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.762
Isn't he deaf?

31:34.762 --> 31:38.157
Uh... In one ear. Since birth.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.462
Wow, that's impressive

31:39.462 --> 31:41.073
that he could be, like,
that good, you know?

31:41.073 --> 31:42.726
And half deaf.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.032
So you're, like, single?

31:44.032 --> 31:47.079
Yo.
Shut the fuck up, Diego.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.516
What? You think
she's gonna date you?

31:49.516 --> 31:51.213
Where are you gonna take her?
You live with your mom.

31:51.213 --> 31:54.042
God damn.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.261
Allison, I'm sorry.

31:55.261 --> 31:58.351
My fucking friend
has no tact at all.

31:58.351 --> 32:01.093
We're not used to having

32:01.093 --> 32:03.747
pretty girls such as yourself
come in here.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.488
So, you gotta excuse his

32:05.488 --> 32:07.229
lack of decor.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.711
Decorum.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.626
What?

32:13.757 --> 32:16.021
"Decor" is

32:16.021 --> 32:20.112
the Bud Light lamp
above my head.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.854
"Decorum" is his behavior.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.771
Neither is currently ideal.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.300
Hey, can I ask you
something, like,

32:35.388 --> 32:37.085
between us old friends?

32:37.085 --> 32:39.348
You weren't our friend.
You were popular.

32:39.348 --> 32:41.524
- You were a bitch, actually.
- All right. Diego.

32:43.265 --> 32:46.051
That's old shit.
Right, Allison?

32:46.051 --> 32:48.531
We're past that.
We're grown-ups.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.447
Those of us stuck behind
this force field,

32:51.447 --> 32:54.407
- we gotta stick together.
Yeah.

32:54.407 --> 32:58.628
Um, do you know
where I could get some Oxy?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.152
God damn, girl.

33:00.152 --> 33:02.328
No foreplay. No nothing.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.548
No "How are you?
How's your family?"

33:05.548 --> 33:06.985
No, we don't fuck with pills.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.161
I remember in high school

33:09.161 --> 33:11.076
you were the guys
that could, like,

33:11.990 --> 33:13.208
get anything.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.167
And now you're just
buttering us up.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.866
I don't have any money.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.303
How are you gonna pay
for that tequila?

33:21.303 --> 33:24.002
I hadn't got that far yet.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.916
- Is that Rolex real?
- Wait a second.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.615
Wait. Allie Johnson.

33:28.615 --> 33:31.574
Miss lovely Allie Johnson.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.838
You just stroll in here.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.753
You got no money.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.234
And you expect us
to get you Oxy?

33:39.234 --> 33:41.932
For free, and then you want us
to pay for your drink.

33:43.456 --> 33:44.935
Why the fuck would we do that?

33:46.415 --> 33:47.851
Nostalgia?

33:48.896 --> 33:50.332
Old friends?

33:50.332 --> 33:51.942
You thought you were
such hot shit in high school.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.118
You're no
fucking different now.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.597
All right. Shut up.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.425
Sorry.

33:56.425 --> 33:59.776
This guy. No decorum.

33:59.776 --> 34:00.951
No, he's right.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.912
I didn't think I was better
than you. I knew it.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.610
I looked down
on guys like you.

34:09.090 --> 34:12.006
I thought
you were Jersey trash

34:12.006 --> 34:14.617
that would never be able
to make it out of town.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.492
Fucking bitch.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.320
But now you're sitting here

34:22.060 --> 34:23.713
right beside us

34:23.713 --> 34:26.368
and you're looking for a fix.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.935
A favor.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.155
The favor is a fix.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.984
- You're a fucking junkie now.
- No, I'm not.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.074
- You're a fucking junkie.
- No.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.162
Yeah, you are.
- Yeah, you are.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.554
Come on.
You're a fuckin' junkie.

34:38.554 --> 34:39.860
No. I'm not like you.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.296
Allie Johnson,

34:41.296 --> 34:43.690
you're so much more
like who you think we are

34:43.690 --> 34:45.213
than we actually are.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.478
Come on.
Say it, say it, say it.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.263
"I'm a fucking junkie."
You might like it.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.091
Fuck you. It's a pill.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.224
It's heroin
in a pretty little dress.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.921
I thought you were
the nice one.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.882
Why don't you say it?
Say... Say,

35:02.752 --> 35:05.146
"I'm a fucking junkie,"

35:05.146 --> 35:07.714
and then I'll get you whatever
you want. Anything.

35:09.237 --> 35:12.501
Say it. Just, like,
just come out with it.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.676
I'm currently reliant...

35:13.676 --> 35:17.202
No, that's not
what I fucking said.

35:17.202 --> 35:20.074
You sneaky little bitch.
That's not what I fucking said.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.336
- Is that what I said?
- No.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.164
That is not what I said.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.516
Say you're a fuckin' junkie.
Look at me.

35:27.516 --> 35:28.691
Look at me!

35:29.692 --> 35:32.521
Look me in the eyes, and say,

35:32.521 --> 35:35.742
"I'm a fucking junkie."

35:35.742 --> 35:37.135
Say it!

35:41.226 --> 35:42.923
I'm a fucking junkie.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.146
Good girl.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.106
Beth, I got these tequilas.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.718
I'm sorry
for raising my voice.

35:55.718 --> 35:56.893
We're just catching up.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.157
Allie, this is Beth.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.202
She's divine. She's the best.

36:08.601 --> 36:09.950
That's not Oxy.

36:10.690 --> 36:11.908
Same shit.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.340
Thank you.
Ooh, she just walked in.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.125
Oh, my God.
I was so worried about you.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.214
Where were you?

36:56.214 --> 36:59.217
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, babe, oh.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.131
- I'm sorry.
- Uh-huh. No...

37:01.131 --> 37:02.829
I need help.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.178
I know. I never should have

37:04.178 --> 37:05.658
flushed those pills
down the toilet.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.182
I had no right. I'm so sorry.
I was just so worried.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.401
Can you help me, please, Mama?

37:09.401 --> 37:11.185
Yes, yes, I already did.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.231
Here, I got these from Linda.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.841
She's the woman
who works next to me

37:14.841 --> 37:16.495
in the toy kiosk at the mall.

37:16.495 --> 37:17.974
Her doctor gave them to her

37:17.974 --> 37:19.759
after she got punched
in the face by a shoplifter,

37:19.759 --> 37:20.977
but she said
she didn't need them.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.283
She swore by the neck brace.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.067
But you need 'em, honey.
So here.

37:24.067 --> 37:26.722
That right there is a gift
from Linda, okay?

37:26.722 --> 37:28.289
And we can worry
about kicking it later.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.725
Let's not rush things.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.945
What matters the most
is that you're home safe.

37:31.945 --> 37:35.122
Oh, babe.
Oh, my baby.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.259
Hey, Ry?

37:42.869 --> 37:44.784
Got Chinese food!

37:45.698 --> 37:48.222
I got sweet and sour chicken,

37:48.222 --> 37:51.007
beef with broccoli,
steamed rice.

37:51.747 --> 37:52.705
Where are ya?

37:53.358 --> 37:54.663
Hey, Ry?

37:55.925 --> 37:57.057
Ryan!

37:58.711 --> 38:01.148
What the...
Daniel, get out!

38:01.148 --> 38:02.454
- Hey. Hey!

38:02.454 --> 38:04.151
Okay. Whoa, whoa! Okay.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down!
It's not what you think.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.503
I'm pretty sure it is
what I think. How old are you?

38:08.503 --> 38:09.678
Daniel! Get off of him.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.027
Shut up!

38:11.027 --> 38:12.638
I asked you a question, boy.
How old are you?

38:12.638 --> 38:14.988
- I'm 20.
- She's 16, and I'm an ex-cop.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.555
Looks like you picked
the wrong girl.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.773
You're choking him!

38:17.773 --> 38:19.601
She said she was 18 online.

38:19.601 --> 38:22.300
If I ever catch you
near my granddaughter again,

38:22.300 --> 38:23.953
I'm gonna rip
your fucking dick off

38:23.953 --> 38:25.564
and shove it down your throat.
You feel me?

38:25.564 --> 38:27.217
Yes, sir. Yes.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.002
Get the fuck out of here.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.439
Yes, sir.
Uh, I need my clothes.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.137
They're in my house.
They're my clothes now.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.313
Run away!

38:37.706 --> 38:38.838
Daniel!

38:38.838 --> 38:40.883
Get out of my fucking room!

38:40.883 --> 38:42.232
What the fuck?

38:42.232 --> 38:44.234
Hey, look, everybody!

38:44.234 --> 38:46.715
Statutory rapist
from Williamsburg!

38:46.715 --> 38:47.934
I need my keys!

38:47.934 --> 38:51.285
Oh, his keys! His keys!
Look at him!

38:51.285 --> 38:54.636
He's scrambling to his car!
Statutory rapist!

38:54.636 --> 38:55.855
Hey, Belinda,

38:55.855 --> 38:58.379
I found this fool in bed
with my Ryan.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.250
She said...
She said she was 18 online.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.687
You're a fuckboy.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.950
He's a fuckboy! That's what
the kids call them!

39:03.950 --> 39:06.518
Get out of
our neighborhood, fuckboy!

39:06.518 --> 39:08.084
Okay. Okay!

39:08.084 --> 39:09.172
Get out of here, fuckboy!

39:09.172 --> 39:10.260
All right! All right!

39:10.260 --> 39:11.523
Right fucking now!

39:11.523 --> 39:13.612
- Wet, flaccid fuckboy!
Okay, okay!

39:13.612 --> 39:14.700
Okay!

39:17.920 --> 39:19.966
I cannot believe
you just did that!

39:19.966 --> 39:21.054
Give me your phone.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.144
Give me the fucking phone
right now!

39:29.192 --> 39:30.672
You're grounded.

39:30.672 --> 39:33.936
You hear me?
You're grounded until...

39:33.936 --> 39:37.070
Shit, I can't think of
when you won't be grounded.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.898
You can't just lock me up, Daniel.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.857
For the last
fucking time, Ryan,

39:41.857 --> 39:43.903
you call me "Grandpa."

39:46.645 --> 39:50.431
I hate you!
I fucking hate you!

Allison, don't go.

42:27.283 --> 42:30.591
- This was a mistake.
- No. No, it isn't.

42:30.591 --> 42:34.595
Trust me, I know
how hard it is to get here.

42:34.595 --> 42:37.555
It's damn near impossible,
and you did it.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.687
Don't run away now
because of me.

42:39.687 --> 42:40.949
There are thousands
of meetings.

42:40.949 --> 42:42.560
- I'll find another one.
- Well, yeah,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.300
but this one
has the best snacks.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.954
- I wanna go.
- No.

42:45.954 --> 42:48.478
No, no. You've made it
this far, and I wouldn't.

42:48.478 --> 42:50.655
I don't wanna be here.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.221
Nobody does in the beginning.

42:52.221 --> 42:54.659
I don't wanna be anywhere.

42:54.659 --> 42:57.313
Then you are definitely
in the right spot.

42:58.401 --> 42:59.751
I thought you were sober.

43:00.534 --> 43:01.927
Ten years.

43:01.927 --> 43:05.670
I kinda slacked off
coming to regular meetings,

43:05.670 --> 43:07.410
and then lately, I...

43:08.455 --> 43:10.457
I realized I need the support.

43:11.458 --> 43:12.677
Because of what happened?

43:12.677 --> 43:15.810
No, no, no! No, it's...

43:15.810 --> 43:17.377
Is the accident the reason
why you came back?

43:17.377 --> 43:18.813
No, I just feel that...

43:18.813 --> 43:20.554
Daniel, am I the reason
why you're back here?

43:20.554 --> 43:21.686
Yes!

43:25.646 --> 43:26.995
Yes, of course.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.564
What the hell
do you want me to say?

43:31.434 --> 43:33.349
- I'm sorry.
- No.

43:33.349 --> 43:35.264
Look.

43:35.264 --> 43:39.704
I got ten years,
and lately, I've been feeling

43:39.704 --> 43:43.229
like I really,
really want a drink.

43:45.057 --> 43:46.406
This works.

43:48.669 --> 43:49.757
Thank you.

43:49.757 --> 43:52.804
Um, I'm gonna find
somewhere else.

43:52.804 --> 43:54.588
There are thousands
of these meetings.

43:54.588 --> 43:57.852
Yeah, but somehow you found
your way to this one.

43:59.462 --> 44:00.855
Now isn't that something?

44:03.771 --> 44:05.381
All right, come on.

44:09.995 --> 44:11.126
Come on.

44:13.215 --> 44:14.260
Okay.

44:15.827 --> 44:17.829
<i>Everybody, welcome.</i>

44:17.829 --> 44:19.352
This is the regular meeting

44:19.352 --> 44:22.050
of the Live and Let Live group
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

44:22.050 --> 44:23.356
My name is Simone,

44:23.356 --> 44:26.141
and I'm an alcoholic,
and your secretary.

44:26.141 --> 44:29.057
Let us open the meeting
with the Serenity Prayer.

44:31.233 --> 44:32.365
God...

44:32.365 --> 44:33.540
...grant me the serenity

44:33.540 --> 44:36.064
to accept the things
I cannot change,

44:36.064 --> 44:38.719
the courage
to change the things I can,

44:38.719 --> 44:41.766
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

44:47.554 --> 44:51.210
Hey, you got up awfully early
this morning.

44:51.210 --> 44:53.212
I went to an NA meeting.

44:53.212 --> 44:55.954
What? You did?
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

44:55.954 --> 44:59.697
Oh, Allie.
I'm so happy to hear that.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.047
Well, I'm not saying
I'm gonna go again.

45:02.047 --> 45:04.353
Well, you gotta start somewhere,

45:04.353 --> 45:05.920
and sounds like you did.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.487
- Mm-hmm.
- So that's good.

45:07.487 --> 45:12.100
I don't know if I'll be able
to just quit, though, Mom.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.189
I think I need real help,

45:14.189 --> 45:16.801
like an in-patient program
or something.

45:16.801 --> 45:18.672
Well, honey,
neither of us has insurance,

45:18.672 --> 45:21.370
so how the hell are we
supposed to pay for that?

45:21.370 --> 45:22.937
I mean, you gotta get a job.

45:22.937 --> 45:25.723
Mom, who's gonna hire me
like this?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.812
- Come on.
- Like, no...

45:27.812 --> 45:28.987
What do you mean?

45:28.987 --> 45:30.684
You're a beautiful
26-year-old woman.

45:30.684 --> 45:33.382
- You're smart, you're funny...
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

45:33.382 --> 45:35.123
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

45:35.123 --> 45:36.864
That's the old me
you're describing.

45:36.864 --> 45:37.952
You're still you.

45:37.952 --> 45:40.912
No, I'm not! I'm...

45:40.912 --> 45:43.218
I'm something else.

45:45.003 --> 45:46.178
I'm something...

45:47.222 --> 45:48.746
Ugh. Um...

45:54.186 --> 45:56.231
I was thinking, um...

45:59.800 --> 46:03.456
You know how Dad was probably
gonna get me a wedding gift,

46:03.456 --> 46:05.763
or, well, at least
he was gonna come, right?

46:05.763 --> 46:07.634
Maybe instead
of whatever it was

46:07.634 --> 46:09.462
that he was gonna give me,

46:10.985 --> 46:15.337
maybe he could help pay
for me to get help.

46:15.337 --> 46:17.775
And so, I was wondering if you

46:18.471 --> 46:20.081
would call him for me.

46:20.081 --> 46:23.389
Allie, I will never speak
to that man as long as I live.

46:23.389 --> 46:24.869
Do you know what he did?

46:24.869 --> 46:27.523
He packed his car up,
and he left us with nothing.

46:27.523 --> 46:29.525
But it is what it is, okay?

46:29.525 --> 46:32.964
So, you gotta pull yourself up
by your bootstraps, now.

46:34.574 --> 46:35.793
Thanks, Mom.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.577
Yeah, I'm sorry
I can't get over this

46:37.577 --> 46:39.405
as fast as you want me to.

46:39.405 --> 46:41.015
- Allie...
- Nah.

46:52.157 --> 46:53.811
Well, look who it is.

46:54.550 --> 46:56.857
Hi, Dad.

46:56.857 --> 47:00.034
What brings you to the less
glamorous side of the river?

47:00.034 --> 47:02.428
Ryan asked me to come see her.

47:02.428 --> 47:05.083
Turns out, she really
wanted me to talk to you.

47:05.083 --> 47:07.433
- Oh?
- She's worried about you.

47:07.433 --> 47:09.130
She's worried about me?

47:10.131 --> 47:12.003
That girl's crazy.

47:12.003 --> 47:14.919
She says she thinks
you need a friend.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.703
Hell, I don't need a friend.

47:16.703 --> 47:18.879
I need a dog crate
the size of a teenager.

47:22.317 --> 47:24.450
Look, Nathan,
I understand your need

47:24.450 --> 47:26.408
to move on
after the breakup...

47:28.846 --> 47:29.890
but, hell, I never imagined

47:29.890 --> 47:32.806
I'd be doing this
all by myself.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.460
You raised two kids.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.722
I had your mother.

47:37.550 --> 47:40.161
And you and your sister were
much better behaved than Ry.

47:42.903 --> 47:45.340
What? Come on.
Speak your mind, son.

47:45.340 --> 47:48.256
We were good because
we were terrified of you.

47:49.954 --> 47:51.738
So, I'm not surprised

47:51.738 --> 47:53.174
you don't have any tools
in your arsenal

47:53.174 --> 47:55.394
since you lost
the only one that you had.

47:55.394 --> 47:56.874
Fear.

47:59.877 --> 48:05.447
I have apologized 100 times
to you for the way I was.

48:07.972 --> 48:11.497
Your sister found a way
to give me another chance.

48:11.497 --> 48:13.151
How come you can't?

48:13.151 --> 48:16.632
'Cause Molly never really got
the brunt of it, did she?

48:16.632 --> 48:19.679
I guarantee you that if
she was standing here now,

48:19.679 --> 48:22.290
she would be begging you
to drop this shit,

48:22.290 --> 48:23.857
and help me raise her child.

48:23.857 --> 48:25.380
Well, she isn't.

48:27.295 --> 48:28.775
No, she's not.

48:32.822 --> 48:34.563
I have to catch the train.

48:35.738 --> 48:37.175
I saw Allison.

48:41.657 --> 48:42.789
Where?

48:42.789 --> 48:44.878
Not supposed to say.

48:45.966 --> 48:47.533
AA?

48:47.533 --> 48:48.751
Not supposed to say.

48:48.751 --> 48:50.101
What the hell
does she need AA for?

48:50.101 --> 48:51.885
- I'm not supposed to...
- To say.

48:54.366 --> 48:55.367
I got it.

48:57.108 --> 48:59.458
Of all the meetings,
she ends up at yours?

48:59.458 --> 49:01.982
She saw me,
she tried to run away,

49:01.982 --> 49:04.202
but I pulled her back.

49:04.202 --> 49:05.420
Why?

49:06.595 --> 49:07.814
She's suffering, Nathan.

49:09.381 --> 49:10.425
Broken.

49:11.296 --> 49:12.384
Lost.

49:12.384 --> 49:14.777
You're the one who blamed her!

49:15.909 --> 49:17.302
I stood by her!

49:17.302 --> 49:20.566
Yeah, until she left your ass.

49:20.566 --> 49:24.048
Sorry. Sorry, that came out
harsher than I meant.

49:24.048 --> 49:26.093
I have to catch the train.

49:26.093 --> 49:27.442
Please, Nathan.

49:28.269 --> 49:30.445
I need help.

49:30.445 --> 49:33.231
Ryan asked me to come by
and say "hi" to you.

49:34.275 --> 49:35.537
And I did.

49:36.886 --> 49:37.887
Okay.

49:40.586 --> 49:41.674
Hi.

50:00.823 --> 50:03.435
<i>- Best first date ever.
- I heard that.</i>

50:17.449 --> 50:20.321
<i>I used to drink
whiskey until I blacked out.</i>

50:21.757 --> 50:23.846
Wake up the next morning
to find out

50:25.022 --> 50:27.285
what I had done,
who I had been.

50:33.204 --> 50:34.988
My father was a drunk.

50:37.904 --> 50:42.039
He beat me
right up to the day he died.

50:44.563 --> 50:48.045
And I vowed I would never
lay a hand on my children.

50:50.351 --> 50:51.700
And I didn't...

50:53.746 --> 50:55.269
while I was sober.

50:58.185 --> 50:59.795
But in the blackness...

51:03.582 --> 51:07.325
I always denied because
I really couldn't remember.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.893
Sometimes there'd be a bruise.

51:12.982 --> 51:16.377
"Oh, you must have
fallen down.

51:16.377 --> 51:18.466
"I'm your daddy.
I would never hurt you."

51:20.033 --> 51:22.557
August 11th, '99...

51:25.865 --> 51:30.304
I woke up on my front porch to
the sound of church bells...

51:33.220 --> 51:34.917
and an ice cream truck.

51:35.962 --> 51:38.051
So, I knew it was Sunday.

51:38.051 --> 51:42.229
First thing
I saw was my captain

51:43.491 --> 51:46.015
standing over me,

51:46.015 --> 51:48.627
poking me in the ribs
with his nightstick.

51:51.934 --> 51:53.284
An ambulance.

51:55.112 --> 51:58.854
My son, Nathan,
sitting in the back,

52:00.247 --> 52:01.683
bleeding from the head.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.731
Medics had bought him
a popsicle.

52:08.037 --> 52:09.909
Turns out that...

52:11.911 --> 52:13.739
in the blackness...

52:17.308 --> 52:20.441
I had beat him so bad

52:20.441 --> 52:23.662
that he lost the hearing
in his right ear.

52:23.662 --> 52:24.750
Forever.

52:26.186 --> 52:29.494
And to this day,
every time I see him,

52:29.494 --> 52:33.019
I beg for his forgiveness.

52:34.455 --> 52:36.501
It's just a little dance
we do.

52:37.806 --> 52:39.417
A mere formality.

52:41.419 --> 52:43.029
Because we both know...

52:45.858 --> 52:48.382
that there are some things
that are just

52:50.036 --> 52:51.994
impossible to forgive.

52:56.216 --> 53:01.221
I do believe
even God knows that.

53:08.576 --> 53:11.013
When I was a cop,
I used to eat here every day.

53:11.971 --> 53:13.668
Free coffee refills.

53:16.497 --> 53:17.498
You hungry?

53:19.196 --> 53:20.197
No.

53:20.936 --> 53:21.937
Hmm.

53:24.418 --> 53:26.638
Funny, the things
we stop caring about.

53:28.727 --> 53:30.424
I used to want to travel.

53:32.078 --> 53:34.298
I would leaf through
<i>National Geographic</i>

53:34.298 --> 53:36.300
and dog-ear
all of the exotic places

53:36.300 --> 53:38.606
I would visit once I retired.

53:41.392 --> 53:43.394
Never do that now.

53:43.394 --> 53:46.135
- You still could.
- No, no. I couldn't.

53:51.228 --> 53:56.885
I wasn't drunk,
or on anything, by the way.

53:57.669 --> 53:58.670
What?

53:59.932 --> 54:02.369
When I saw you the other day
at the meeting,

54:04.066 --> 54:08.201
I instantly got worried
that you may have thought

54:08.201 --> 54:11.378
that I was drinking
or on drugs

54:11.378 --> 54:13.075
on the day of the accident,
and I wasn't.

54:13.075 --> 54:15.513
I was sober.
It wasn't my fault.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.517
I have every report
ever written

54:19.517 --> 54:21.301
committed to memory.

54:21.954 --> 54:23.042
Right.

54:25.349 --> 54:26.611
So, you know that it was

54:26.611 --> 54:28.352
the backhoe guy's fault, Alvarez.

54:28.352 --> 54:30.049
I don't wanna get
into that all right now.

54:30.049 --> 54:31.572
Okay, yeah, you're right.

54:36.534 --> 54:39.232
Nathan said that he was deaf
since birth.

54:40.581 --> 54:41.930
He never told you?

54:43.323 --> 54:45.499
Maybe he wanted me
to like you.

54:47.066 --> 54:48.720
I doubt that.

54:52.376 --> 54:56.467
I thought that raising Ryan
would offer me the chance

54:56.467 --> 54:59.121
to be a better father
than I ever was.

54:59.992 --> 55:01.733
Shit.

55:01.733 --> 55:04.692
I'm in way over my head.

55:04.692 --> 55:07.956
I got one of those audiobooks
from the library.

55:07.956 --> 55:09.218
<i>How to Talk to a Teen.</i>

55:09.218 --> 55:11.177
Oh, yeah?

55:11.177 --> 55:12.831
How's that working out?

55:12.831 --> 55:15.442
- Well, it's from the '80s...

55:15.442 --> 55:16.791
It's on a cassette.

55:16.791 --> 55:17.879
Right.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.490
Its advice is,

55:20.839 --> 55:22.319
"Chaperone a dance."

55:26.061 --> 55:28.325
"Chaperone a dance."

55:28.325 --> 55:30.239
I just caught her having sex

55:30.239 --> 55:32.503
with a boy
who looked like a man.

55:34.896 --> 55:36.768
A dance would be delightful.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.119
Can I give you some advice

55:41.120 --> 55:43.122
from a former teenage girl?

55:44.906 --> 55:46.386
She's gonna have sex.

55:47.822 --> 55:50.782
And nothing you say
is gonna change that.

55:53.262 --> 55:55.439
Just make sure
she's on birth control.

55:55.439 --> 55:56.657
- Birth control?
- Yeah.

55:56.657 --> 55:59.094
She's 16!

55:59.094 --> 56:01.314
No, we'll be going
the abstinence route.

56:02.402 --> 56:03.708
No offense, Daniel,

56:03.708 --> 56:06.493
but, uh, there's a knot
in your logic.

56:07.973 --> 56:09.366
You're trying to solve
a problem

56:09.366 --> 56:11.193
by looking
in the other direction.

56:14.632 --> 56:16.590
I could talk to her
if you want me to.

56:16.590 --> 56:18.549
Oh, well, no thanks.

56:18.549 --> 56:20.159
- It's okay. Of course.
- That's not appropriate.

56:20.159 --> 56:21.595
I don't even know
why I just said that.

56:21.595 --> 56:22.857
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

56:22.857 --> 56:24.381
It's just that
I don't think that it's...

56:24.381 --> 56:25.947
I just felt the need,

56:27.427 --> 56:30.387
um, the instinct
to help in some way.

56:31.344 --> 56:32.867
It's the least I could do.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.355
I don't know how to do this.

56:43.356 --> 56:44.313
What?

56:44.836 --> 56:46.359
Start all over.

56:48.143 --> 56:49.493
How do you do it?

56:50.755 --> 56:52.147
Takes work.

56:55.150 --> 56:58.110
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Sure.

57:03.115 --> 57:05.334
I'm not sure I have the will.

57:27.487 --> 57:30.011
What does <i>"amor fati"</i> mean?

57:33.928 --> 57:35.539
Certain things are private.

57:36.714 --> 57:38.542
Do you think I'm fucked up?

57:39.978 --> 57:42.023
Are you high right now?

57:43.329 --> 57:44.461
No.

57:45.853 --> 57:47.855
I was a cop for 40 years.

57:47.855 --> 57:49.553
I was an addict for 50.

57:51.076 --> 57:53.165
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

57:54.383 --> 57:55.907
Are you high right now?

57:56.908 --> 57:58.126
Well, I...

57:59.954 --> 58:01.608
I broke a pill in half.

58:01.608 --> 58:03.044
So, half.

58:04.872 --> 58:07.309
Yes, I think
you're fucked up, Allison.

58:10.225 --> 58:11.531
Not half.

58:12.401 --> 58:14.273
All fucked up.

58:14.273 --> 58:16.188
Do you think
I'll ever pull out of this?

58:18.016 --> 58:23.325
I mean, like, maybe one day
I might be the kind of person

58:24.762 --> 58:26.241
that people want
their granddaughter

58:26.241 --> 58:28.287
to hang out with?

58:28.287 --> 58:29.984
I have no idea.

58:31.769 --> 58:33.031
Me neither.

58:48.350 --> 58:51.353
Can I have
my phone back, please?

58:51.353 --> 58:54.182
I'm running out of ideas
on how to handle you, Ryan.

58:55.270 --> 58:56.837
Grandpa,
everybody at my age has sex.

58:56.837 --> 58:58.709
It's, like, not a big deal.

58:58.709 --> 59:00.101
I know it was different
when you were younger,

59:00.101 --> 59:02.930
but that's just, like,
not how it is anymore.

59:06.891 --> 59:09.241
Well,
let me ask you something.

59:15.464 --> 59:16.509
Are you...

59:19.033 --> 59:21.079
Are you using

59:21.906 --> 59:24.212
any protection?

59:24.212 --> 59:25.823
Oh, my God!

59:25.823 --> 59:28.521
I am so not gonna talk about
this with my grandfather.

59:28.521 --> 59:30.523
How the hell
do you think I feel?

59:34.571 --> 59:37.095
- I know you're upset.
- I'm not upset.

59:37.095 --> 59:38.357
Maybe you should go back

59:39.227 --> 59:40.751
and see that therapist again.

59:40.751 --> 59:42.056
No. I just

59:43.188 --> 59:45.843
want my phone back.

59:45.843 --> 59:49.063
I don't have any friends
at Columbia

59:49.063 --> 59:51.370
and I want to

59:51.370 --> 59:54.025
hang onto the few I still have
on Long Beach Island.

59:55.374 --> 59:57.071
How come
you can't make friends?

59:57.071 --> 59:58.725
I've been through a lot
this year.

59:59.247 --> 1:00:00.509
Hmm.

1:00:01.467 --> 1:00:03.948
And nobody really understands.

1:00:05.166 --> 1:00:07.604
They try. Some, but...

1:00:08.561 --> 1:00:10.171
I mean, it's fake.

1:00:10.171 --> 1:00:11.999
Don't you think
most people are so fake?

1:00:13.435 --> 1:00:16.047
I would probably say
"duplicitous."

1:00:17.048 --> 1:00:18.136
What does that mean?

1:00:18.963 --> 1:00:20.486
Fake.

1:00:23.576 --> 1:00:24.925
I'm on your side.

1:00:26.884 --> 1:00:27.928
I know.

1:00:28.581 --> 1:00:30.235
Tell you what.

1:00:30.235 --> 1:00:33.107
You can have your phone back

1:00:33.107 --> 1:00:36.981
if you promise to start taking
birth control pills.

1:00:36.981 --> 1:00:38.983
Ugh! Oh, my God! Daniel!

1:00:38.983 --> 1:00:40.114
Grandpa!

1:00:42.943 --> 1:00:44.031
Grandpa.

1:00:45.467 --> 1:00:48.340
Is it a deal?
I'll make the appointment.

1:00:49.994 --> 1:00:52.257
Fine. Fine.

1:00:52.257 --> 1:00:53.737
I just

1:00:53.737 --> 1:00:56.783
never want to talk to you
about sex ever again.

1:00:58.002 --> 1:01:00.134
Oh, really?

1:01:01.005 --> 1:01:02.789
'Cause I just love this shit.

1:01:09.709 --> 1:01:11.537
Have you ever been
on campus before?

1:01:11.537 --> 1:01:13.234
Not since I was a kid.

1:01:13.234 --> 1:01:14.888
I used to do swim meets here.

1:01:14.888 --> 1:01:16.194
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1:01:16.194 --> 1:01:18.196
- You were a swimmer?
Uh, yeah.

1:01:18.196 --> 1:01:20.720
Well, I was 12, but yeah,
I was pretty good.

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:22.853
I still have all the trophies
and the ribbons.

1:01:22.853 --> 1:01:24.811
- That's cool.
- Mmm.

1:01:24.811 --> 1:01:27.684
- What stroke?
- Mostly freestyle.

1:01:29.076 --> 1:01:30.338
Why'd you stop?

1:01:31.209 --> 1:01:34.429
Um, my dad left.

1:01:34.429 --> 1:01:37.258
Yeah, it was kinda the thing
that we used to do together.

1:01:37.258 --> 1:01:39.696
He would cheer so loud
I could hear him underwater.

1:01:41.045 --> 1:01:43.047
Seemed kind of pointless
to do it without him.

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:46.790
- Where'd he go?
- Ohio.

1:01:48.139 --> 1:01:49.706
Started a whole new family
in Ohio.

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:51.272
Wow.

1:01:51.272 --> 1:01:54.014
He has 10-year-old twins. Yeah.

1:01:54.014 --> 1:01:56.103
I don't know
if they swim or not, though.

1:01:56.103 --> 1:01:58.671
Oh, man. I am always
just amazed at people

1:01:58.671 --> 1:02:01.239
who can, like, up and leave
their kids like that.

1:02:01.239 --> 1:02:02.370
Mmm.

1:02:02.370 --> 1:02:03.720
I just don't know
how you could,

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.810
like, fucking sleep at night.

1:02:06.810 --> 1:02:10.901
For so long, I thought
that I'd done something wrong.

1:02:10.901 --> 1:02:14.339
Like, it was my fault,
or I'd let him down.

1:02:15.514 --> 1:02:18.386
And then I just realized,

1:02:18.386 --> 1:02:21.694
I don't know, maybe
some people just aren't good.

1:02:21.694 --> 1:02:22.826
Hmm.

1:02:24.349 --> 1:02:26.655
It's kinda like he, like,
restarted a level

1:02:26.655 --> 1:02:29.093
in a video game
with a fresh life.

1:02:29.093 --> 1:02:31.617
- That's exactly what he did!

1:02:31.617 --> 1:02:35.621
He packed up the car,
and left his Rolex

1:02:35.621 --> 1:02:38.276
in the attic of my dollhouse,

1:02:38.276 --> 1:02:39.843
and he drove away.

1:02:43.672 --> 1:02:44.717
Hey, let's sit
for a second, okay?

1:02:44.717 --> 1:02:46.501
- Yeah, yeah.

1:02:48.155 --> 1:02:51.768
Uh... So, I'll sponsor you.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:54.901
- Okay.
- But, um,

1:02:54.901 --> 1:02:56.816
you gotta start
taking this shit seriously.

1:02:58.296 --> 1:03:00.733
You can't keep coming
to meetings high.

1:03:00.733 --> 1:03:02.169
What?

1:03:04.998 --> 1:03:06.739
How did you know?

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:10.874
Uh, because I was you.

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:13.790
And I've helped
dozens of women who were you.

1:03:15.226 --> 1:03:19.012
And some beat it,
and some are dead.

1:03:21.841 --> 1:03:23.103
But, you know,

1:03:24.278 --> 1:03:26.715
if you want my time,
you gotta commit.

1:03:26.715 --> 1:03:28.021
Because I have a toddler
so I just

1:03:28.021 --> 1:03:29.327
- don't have time for bullshit.
- Yeah.

1:03:29.327 --> 1:03:33.070
No, I do. I... I...
I really wanna beat it.

1:03:33.070 --> 1:03:35.855
Then I want you to do
90 meetings in 90 days.

1:03:35.855 --> 1:03:37.422
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1:03:37.422 --> 1:03:40.251
And, um, we're gonna
get you started on step one.

1:03:41.339 --> 1:03:42.296
Okay.

1:03:43.558 --> 1:03:44.690
Okay.

1:03:44.690 --> 1:03:48.476
Also, enough hiding out, man.

1:03:48.476 --> 1:03:49.738
It's time you shared
with the group.

1:03:51.828 --> 1:03:53.830
- All right.
- Uh...

1:03:56.441 --> 1:04:02.490
Hi, I'm Allison,
and I'm addicted to, uh,

1:04:03.883 --> 1:04:05.406
pills.

1:04:05.406 --> 1:04:07.582
Hi, Allison.

1:04:07.582 --> 1:04:08.714
Uh...

1:04:10.194 --> 1:04:12.370
Sorry. Can I start again?

1:04:12.370 --> 1:04:14.589
I've never done this before,
and I'm nervous.

1:04:14.589 --> 1:04:15.721
You got it.

1:04:20.378 --> 1:04:25.426
Hi, I'm Allison,
and I'm an addict.

1:04:25.426 --> 1:04:27.298
Hi, Allison.

1:04:30.475 --> 1:04:31.650
I...

1:04:33.913 --> 1:04:34.871
Um...

1:04:38.048 --> 1:04:39.658
I was the driver

1:04:41.094 --> 1:04:43.096
of a car

1:04:43.096 --> 1:04:44.924
that was in
a really bad accident.

1:04:48.188 --> 1:04:49.581
Two people died.

1:04:53.193 --> 1:04:54.499
The woman was...

1:04:58.242 --> 1:05:01.680
The woman was about to be
my sister-in-law.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:08.252
We were on our way to try on
my wedding dresses.

1:05:12.604 --> 1:05:13.735
And then we weren't.

1:05:15.215 --> 1:05:16.477
It wasn't my fault.

1:05:18.131 --> 1:05:21.613
I wasn't on drugs or booze,
or drunk, or anything.

1:05:23.702 --> 1:05:24.877
But, uh...

1:05:35.279 --> 1:05:39.022
Surviving that day was, is...

1:05:42.373 --> 1:05:44.288
the most painful thing

1:05:44.288 --> 1:05:46.159
I will ever
have to live through.

1:05:48.727 --> 1:05:51.034
I got hurt, too.

1:05:52.035 --> 1:05:53.775
They put a hole in my head.

1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:56.865
And, um,

1:05:56.865 --> 1:05:58.519
that helped because
at least I had something

1:05:58.519 --> 1:05:59.912
I could blame the pain on.

1:06:02.654 --> 1:06:03.916
But then that healed...

1:06:06.788 --> 1:06:08.225
and I was still hurting.

1:06:10.183 --> 1:06:11.445
And I guess that's why
I didn't realize

1:06:11.445 --> 1:06:13.491
how bad it was because to me...

1:06:15.841 --> 1:06:17.538
I was still in so much pain.

1:06:27.592 --> 1:06:30.856
I was, um, prescribed them
for physical pain,

1:06:30.856 --> 1:06:32.989
and they really helped
with that. They really did.

1:06:37.384 --> 1:06:39.908
But they made me numb.
Blissfully numb.

1:06:45.479 --> 1:06:47.090
Without them I want to die.

1:06:48.743 --> 1:06:50.354
Every day.

1:06:54.097 --> 1:06:56.882
I've never said that
out loud before.

1:07:00.059 --> 1:07:01.017
Um...

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:05.804
I've never really faced
reality without them.

1:07:08.154 --> 1:07:10.374
And I don't know if I'll be
able to handle what I see,

1:07:10.374 --> 1:07:13.725
but I'm here to try.

1:07:18.512 --> 1:07:19.905
Okay. That's it.

1:07:21.385 --> 1:07:23.691
That's it.

1:07:27.434 --> 1:07:28.609
What happens now?

1:07:44.930 --> 1:07:46.105
You made all of this?

1:07:47.628 --> 1:07:51.328
Uh, I assembled it
and designed it.

1:07:51.328 --> 1:07:53.069
Yeah.

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:56.985
You see,
the houses come as a kit.

1:07:56.985 --> 1:07:59.945
You just assemble them
and paint them...

1:07:59.945 --> 1:08:02.382
Schoolhouse,
I built from scratch.

1:08:06.821 --> 1:08:10.216
Hey, there are two kids
making out back here.

1:08:10.216 --> 1:08:11.826
- That's me.

1:08:12.958 --> 1:08:14.829
- You were handsome.

1:08:15.265 --> 1:08:16.309
And tiny.

1:08:17.832 --> 1:08:21.488
Yeah, my very first kiss
behind the schoolhouse.

1:08:23.142 --> 1:08:24.622
Olivia Williams.

1:08:26.493 --> 1:08:28.930
It was fall.
Tip of her nose was cold.

1:08:30.193 --> 1:08:32.151
Little runny.

1:08:32.151 --> 1:08:35.415
She stood on tiptoe.
Tasted like bubble gum.

1:08:36.634 --> 1:08:37.591
Is that
who you married?

1:08:37.591 --> 1:08:39.593
No! No, no.

1:08:39.593 --> 1:08:43.423
No, she dumped me the next day
for Charlie Cook.

1:08:43.423 --> 1:08:46.731
- Oh.
- He smoked Camels.

1:08:46.731 --> 1:08:50.343
And drove
a Buick Riviera Roadmaster.

1:08:50.343 --> 1:08:52.519
So, is this all inspired
by your life?

1:08:53.303 --> 1:08:54.304
Kinda.

1:08:55.522 --> 1:08:57.133
Supposed to be South Orange.

1:08:58.482 --> 1:08:59.526
I grew up here.

1:09:01.006 --> 1:09:02.616
I was a cop in Newark.

1:09:03.661 --> 1:09:05.010
I've always lived here.

1:09:07.186 --> 1:09:08.187
Who's the soldier?

1:09:09.014 --> 1:09:10.407
That's me.

1:09:10.407 --> 1:09:12.757
Day I got home from Vietnam.

1:09:14.106 --> 1:09:16.587
That other little figure there
is my father.

1:09:16.587 --> 1:09:19.981
He came down to the station
to pick me up.

1:09:19.981 --> 1:09:21.940
- This is incredible.
- Mm.

1:09:23.507 --> 1:09:25.248
How long did it take you?

1:09:25.248 --> 1:09:27.250
Years.

1:09:27.250 --> 1:09:29.426
I started
with a single figure-eight

1:09:30.209 --> 1:09:32.080
and a two-car train.

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:34.518
I work on it when I can.

1:09:35.562 --> 1:09:37.608
Got more time
now that I've retired.

1:09:38.565 --> 1:09:40.437
My wife passed.

1:09:40.437 --> 1:09:42.743
Ryan used to hang out with me
down here.

1:09:44.049 --> 1:09:46.965
She liked the whistle
and the microphone.

1:09:46.965 --> 1:09:48.314
There's a microphone?

1:09:48.314 --> 1:09:49.750
Right over there.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:51.361
How else you gonna tell
your passengers

1:09:51.361 --> 1:09:53.058
- that the train's coming?

1:10:09.205 --> 1:10:12.643
<i>♪ Take the last train

1:10:12.643 --> 1:10:15.689

1:10:32.402 --> 1:10:34.795
That was just a little
serenade for your people

1:10:34.795 --> 1:10:36.362
from the heavens above.

1:10:36.362 --> 1:10:39.583
Think that's one of the
reasons I enjoy it so much.

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:42.281
Why?
'Cause you get to play God?

1:10:42.281 --> 1:10:45.893
Well, so much of my life
has been outta control.

1:10:48.069 --> 1:10:50.246
Down here,

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:53.161
I get to decide
if Olivia chooses me.

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:57.122
I get to decide
if my father comes

1:10:57.122 --> 1:10:59.429
to pick me up at the station
when I get home.

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:01.866
Did he?

1:11:01.866 --> 1:11:02.954
No.

1:11:05.217 --> 1:11:08.089
He was passed out drunk
in our backyard.

1:11:10.788 --> 1:11:13.399
He'd lain face down so long,

1:11:14.748 --> 1:11:17.316
an inch of snow had gathered
on his back.

1:11:21.407 --> 1:11:23.975
Next morning at breakfast,
he offered me a beer,

1:11:25.629 --> 1:11:26.673
so...

1:11:28.371 --> 1:11:30.590
I had a beer with him
at breakfast,

1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:34.290
and I never stopped.

1:11:39.730 --> 1:11:41.558
When did you last talk
to Nathan?

1:11:46.258 --> 1:11:48.216
Daniel, this is God.

1:11:48.216 --> 1:11:51.437
Allison would like you to
change the conversation now.

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:54.875
- I'll bet she would.

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:57.313
All right.
Let's get outta here.

1:12:08.889 --> 1:12:10.151
Ryan?

1:12:10.151 --> 1:12:12.502
It's only one o'clock.
Why are you home?

1:12:12.502 --> 1:12:14.982
We had a half-day
for the active shooter drill.

1:12:14.982 --> 1:12:17.158
- I told you this morning.

1:12:17.158 --> 1:12:20.248
Well, this is a friend of mine
from the program.

1:12:20.248 --> 1:12:21.162
Hi.

1:12:22.425 --> 1:12:24.035
Hi.

1:12:24.035 --> 1:12:25.950
- You should probably get going.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:12:25.950 --> 1:12:27.821
I'm gonna go.

1:12:27.821 --> 1:12:30.215
Wait, I know you
from somewhere.

1:12:30.215 --> 1:12:31.303
No, you don't.

1:12:31.738 --> 1:12:32.696
You do?

1:12:32.696 --> 1:12:33.653
How do I know you?

1:12:34.306 --> 1:12:36.352
Uh... My... I'm...

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:37.788
I'm Allison.

1:12:37.788 --> 1:12:39.442
Yeah, I've seen you before.

1:12:39.442 --> 1:12:41.748
I thought you said the active
shooter drill ended at 2:00.

1:12:41.748 --> 1:12:43.968
Yeah, that's when the pretend
shooter fights back.

1:12:43.968 --> 1:12:45.970
Today, he shot himself,
so we got out early.

1:12:47.580 --> 1:12:48.755
Why do I know you?

1:12:48.755 --> 1:12:50.496
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say.

1:12:50.496 --> 1:12:52.629
- You were Nathan's fiancee.
- No.

1:12:52.629 --> 1:12:54.282
- You were in the car.
- No.

1:12:54.282 --> 1:12:56.546
- I was, yeah.
- Weren't you driving?

1:12:56.546 --> 1:12:57.547
Wasn't she driving?

1:12:57.547 --> 1:12:59.026
We're in the program together.

1:12:59.026 --> 1:13:01.159
- But I thought you said
it was her fault.
- What?

1:13:01.159 --> 1:13:03.422
How could you bring her
into our house?

1:13:03.422 --> 1:13:04.989
Get out of our fucking house!

1:13:04.989 --> 1:13:06.904
- Okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I...

1:13:06.904 --> 1:13:09.602
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were in school.

1:13:09.602 --> 1:13:11.038
You ruined my fucking life!

1:13:11.038 --> 1:13:14.302
I know, I know, I know.
I'm... I'm really sorry.

1:13:14.302 --> 1:13:17.610
You shouldn't
be here! This is our house!

1:13:17.610 --> 1:13:18.872
My mom grew up in here!

1:13:18.872 --> 1:13:21.092
I sleep in her bedroom.
I use her sheets!

1:13:21.092 --> 1:13:23.137
All right. All right.
She's leaving.

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:25.357
Uh, just in case
this is the last time

1:13:25.357 --> 1:13:27.446
I ever get to talk to you,
please know,

1:13:29.187 --> 1:13:31.668
I also wish it was me.

1:13:32.495 --> 1:13:33.757
Okay? I do.

1:13:35.019 --> 1:13:36.324
I'm gonna go.

1:13:36.324 --> 1:13:38.196
I never got to say goodbye.

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:42.113
I know.

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:48.685
They were going to see a play.

1:13:54.342 --> 1:13:55.474
I know.

1:13:57.128 --> 1:13:58.651
She wanted to see a musical,

1:13:58.651 --> 1:14:00.914
because she loved
all the fancy costumes.

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:07.530
I didn't know that.

1:14:07.530 --> 1:14:10.489
She said you made Nate
really happy.

1:14:10.489 --> 1:14:12.448
That you were the best thing
that ever happened to him.

1:14:13.797 --> 1:14:15.320
He made me happy, too.

1:14:20.151 --> 1:14:22.240
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1:14:23.197 --> 1:14:24.416
- Allison.

1:14:27.158 --> 1:14:28.159
Yeah.

1:14:29.595 --> 1:14:31.031
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

1:14:31.902 --> 1:14:33.164
What?

1:14:34.905 --> 1:14:35.732
Uh...

1:14:45.785 --> 1:14:49.136
So, you're an alcoholic, too?

1:14:49.136 --> 1:14:50.486
Ryan.

1:14:50.486 --> 1:14:51.574
Uh, no.

1:14:53.010 --> 1:14:55.752
Alcohol's not exactly
my problem.

1:14:55.752 --> 1:14:57.623
- What is? Meth?

1:14:57.623 --> 1:14:58.929
Ryan.

1:14:58.929 --> 1:15:02.106
No. Not meth. Um...

1:15:05.196 --> 1:15:07.285
Prescription painkillers.

1:15:08.025 --> 1:15:09.200
Oxy.

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:10.854
How do you know about Oxy?

1:15:10.854 --> 1:15:12.551
Kids at my school snort it.

1:15:12.551 --> 1:15:13.683
It's heroin!

1:15:13.683 --> 1:15:15.032
No, it's not.

1:15:15.032 --> 1:15:16.424
I could get it easier
than I could get a beer.

1:15:16.424 --> 1:15:17.730
They sell it at Rite Aid.

1:15:19.515 --> 1:15:21.342
- So why'd you dump Uncle Nate?
- Ryan.

1:15:21.342 --> 1:15:22.735
He said you ghosted him.

1:15:22.735 --> 1:15:24.041
It's not your business.

1:15:24.041 --> 1:15:26.913
I just don't understand how

1:15:26.913 --> 1:15:28.698
if he was gonna stay with you,

1:15:28.698 --> 1:15:30.787
even after
everything that happened,

1:15:30.787 --> 1:15:31.788
why'd you dump him?

1:15:33.137 --> 1:15:34.355
I was upset.

1:15:38.403 --> 1:15:40.144
And so I ran.

1:15:40.144 --> 1:15:41.841
- Like you, quitting soccer.
Shut up!

1:15:41.841 --> 1:15:43.669
You don't say
"shut up" to me!

1:15:43.669 --> 1:15:44.975
Ever again!

1:15:47.891 --> 1:15:49.632
Why'd you quit soccer?

1:15:49.632 --> 1:15:51.155
- She got into a fight.
- 'Cause I hate every girl
on the team.

1:15:51.155 --> 1:15:52.199
Oh.

1:15:53.897 --> 1:15:55.942
Your parents were telling me
how amazing you were.

1:15:57.509 --> 1:15:59.293
- They were?
Mm-hmm.

1:15:59.293 --> 1:16:01.252
Your dad actually was saying

1:16:01.252 --> 1:16:03.123
how you were definitely
gonna get a scholarship.

1:16:04.995 --> 1:16:06.562
I wanna go to Stanford.

1:16:08.912 --> 1:16:10.435
Why are you laughing?

1:16:12.524 --> 1:16:16.223
You quit the team,
you're mouthing off in school,

1:16:16.223 --> 1:16:17.573
and you're not doing
your homework.

1:16:17.573 --> 1:16:19.357
You're gonna get into Stanford?

1:16:19.357 --> 1:16:21.011
I didn't say
I quit the team permanently.

1:16:21.011 --> 1:16:22.969
I said I wanted
to take a break.

1:16:22.969 --> 1:16:24.362
And I had a 4.0 down the shore.

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:26.494
I could get it back
in a second if I cared.

1:16:26.494 --> 1:16:27.757
Why don't you care?

1:16:27.757 --> 1:16:28.627
Why, do you think?

1:16:30.455 --> 1:16:31.674
Shit.
Okay.

1:16:31.674 --> 1:16:32.936
Why don't we just
call it a night, okay?

1:16:32.936 --> 1:16:34.241
Yeah,
I'm gonna go home.

1:16:39.203 --> 1:16:40.596
Hey, um...

1:16:44.034 --> 1:16:47.080
Um, just in case you,
I don't know,

1:16:49.039 --> 1:16:50.475
wanna talk, need to talk...

1:16:51.911 --> 1:16:52.999
This is me.

1:16:52.999 --> 1:16:55.045
And it's up to you,
but I'm here.

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:57.482
Okay.

1:17:01.878 --> 1:17:03.619
I'm sorry
about all that.

1:17:03.619 --> 1:17:04.837
Uh, it's fine.

1:17:06.665 --> 1:17:08.536
You see what I'm dealing with.

1:17:08.536 --> 1:17:10.060
Honestly, it's okay.

1:17:11.191 --> 1:17:12.410
Look.

1:17:13.541 --> 1:17:15.456
She's a very fragile kid.

1:17:16.762 --> 1:17:20.984
So, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't contact her.

1:17:22.899 --> 1:17:23.943
Oh.

1:17:24.596 --> 1:17:25.597
Okay.

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.470
Yeah, I just...

1:17:29.470 --> 1:17:32.691
I just wanted her
to know that I was available

1:17:32.691 --> 1:17:35.172
if she wanted to talk
or anything.

1:17:35.172 --> 1:17:37.304
I'm just asking if you will

1:17:38.262 --> 1:17:39.742
please just let her be.

1:17:40.612 --> 1:17:41.831
Scout's honor.

1:17:41.831 --> 1:17:44.703
No, that's Spock's
"Live long and prosper."

1:17:44.703 --> 1:17:46.357
We Boy Scouts do this.

1:17:46.357 --> 1:17:48.489
Oh. I prefer Spock.

1:17:49.403 --> 1:17:51.405
Live long and prosper, Daniel.

1:17:51.405 --> 1:17:52.493
Good night.
- Thank you.

1:18:08.422 --> 1:18:09.423
Mmm.

1:19:45.868 --> 1:19:47.913
Go, baby! Go, go, go!

1:19:47.913 --> 1:19:49.306
Come on,
come on, come on.

1:19:49.306 --> 1:19:50.698
Come on!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1:19:50.698 --> 1:19:52.526
- Yeah!

1:19:52.526 --> 1:19:53.701
Attagirl!

1:19:54.702 --> 1:19:56.182
Attagirl!

1:20:00.665 --> 1:20:01.797
Thank you.

1:20:43.926 --> 1:20:45.318
<i>Why do you ride
your bike everywhere?</i>

1:20:45.928 --> 1:20:46.972
Um...

1:20:48.452 --> 1:20:50.497
I haven't been in a car
since the accident.

1:20:51.281 --> 1:20:52.848
'Cause you feel guilty?

1:20:55.328 --> 1:20:56.460
Uh, no.

1:20:57.156 --> 1:21:00.725
Because I feel... scared.

1:21:00.725 --> 1:21:02.248
Daniel says
you were using your phone.

1:21:04.555 --> 1:21:06.470
Uh, I was using Maps.

1:21:07.775 --> 1:21:08.864
Everyone uses Maps.

1:21:08.864 --> 1:21:10.735
Yeah, well,
he has all the reports.

1:21:10.735 --> 1:21:11.954
He's memorized them.

1:21:13.172 --> 1:21:15.305
He stares at them at night.
It's weird.

1:21:15.305 --> 1:21:18.308
Okay, well, I was there.

1:21:18.308 --> 1:21:23.095
And the person who wrote
those reports wasn't, so...

1:21:23.095 --> 1:21:25.532
Tell me
why you ended it with Nate.

1:21:25.532 --> 1:21:27.404
My mom would want you guys
to be together still.

1:21:28.622 --> 1:21:30.711
Ryan, I don't even know
what to say to that.

1:21:31.712 --> 1:21:33.627
My mom used to really, um...

1:21:35.891 --> 1:21:38.806
just, like, look out for him
and stuff, you know? Um...

1:21:39.764 --> 1:21:40.808
And...

1:21:42.201 --> 1:21:44.900
I've been thinking
maybe now I'm supposed to.

1:21:45.770 --> 1:21:46.902
Because she can't.

1:21:48.468 --> 1:21:50.949
I bet that would make her
really proud.

1:21:50.949 --> 1:21:52.211
I could tell you
about what's happening

1:21:52.211 --> 1:21:53.256
- with him if you want.
- No, that's okay.

1:21:53.256 --> 1:21:54.605
Thank you, though.

1:21:54.605 --> 1:21:55.998
I've tried really hard
to avoid all of that...

1:21:55.998 --> 1:21:57.216
He moved to Tribeca.

1:21:57.216 --> 1:21:58.217
Wow.

1:21:59.305 --> 1:22:01.264
Yeah. He has a dog.

1:22:01.264 --> 1:22:02.918
- A dog?
- Mm-hmm.

1:22:02.918 --> 1:22:05.659
A French Bulldog named Jasper.

1:22:05.659 --> 1:22:07.487
He never really struck me
as a Frenchie type,

1:22:07.487 --> 1:22:09.315
but okay.

1:22:09.315 --> 1:22:10.577
It's his girlfriend's.

1:22:15.191 --> 1:22:16.192
Oh.

1:22:17.323 --> 1:22:18.411
Yeah.

1:22:19.891 --> 1:22:21.980
I... I don't need to hear this.

1:22:23.199 --> 1:22:24.852
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1:22:26.811 --> 1:22:28.987
How long have they been
going out?

1:22:28.987 --> 1:22:31.859
I don't know.
Like, four months, I think.

1:22:32.643 --> 1:22:33.557
Wow.

1:22:33.557 --> 1:22:36.908
Yeah. She's a paralegal.

1:22:37.953 --> 1:22:39.128
I don't even know what that is.

1:22:39.128 --> 1:22:40.868
Is that, like, a good thing?

1:22:42.131 --> 1:22:44.046
Yeah. Wow.

1:22:44.046 --> 1:22:46.178
- You just keep saying, "Wow."
- Yeah.

1:22:46.178 --> 1:22:47.614
It's just a lot to take in.

1:22:49.399 --> 1:22:50.878
Um...

1:22:50.878 --> 1:22:53.446
I'm really happy for him. I am.

1:22:53.446 --> 1:22:55.057
He really deserves to be happy.

1:22:55.927 --> 1:22:57.450
I...

1:22:57.450 --> 1:22:59.496
- I shouldn't have told you.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

1:22:59.496 --> 1:23:01.585
But you're upset.

1:23:01.585 --> 1:23:03.630
We went through
so much together.

1:23:05.806 --> 1:23:08.940
I really want good things
to happen to him.

1:23:09.810 --> 1:23:11.160
I'm really sorry

1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:12.422
- I made you upset.
It's okay.

1:23:12.422 --> 1:23:13.597
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- I really

1:23:13.597 --> 1:23:14.990
meant for this to be friendly.

1:23:14.990 --> 1:23:16.992
Yeah. I'll see you in a second.

1:24:08.173 --> 1:24:09.653
Hey.

1:24:09.653 --> 1:24:11.133
Is something wrong?

1:24:11.133 --> 1:24:13.483
I, um... I forgot
I have a job interview.

1:24:13.483 --> 1:24:16.181
So, I'm gonna go.

1:24:16.181 --> 1:24:17.487
- You sick?

1:24:18.096 --> 1:24:19.097
Yeah.

1:24:19.097 --> 1:24:21.447
- Withdrawal?
- I'm trying.

1:24:21.447 --> 1:24:23.319
All right. Look, don't stop.

1:24:24.233 --> 1:24:25.234
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:24:26.844 --> 1:24:27.801
Don't use.

1:24:29.542 --> 1:24:30.717
Okay.

1:24:30.717 --> 1:24:32.110
Don't stay home tonight.
Do something.

1:24:32.110 --> 1:24:34.069
- Okay. Okay.
- All right? Okay.

1:24:35.287 --> 1:24:36.158
You need a hug?

1:24:38.073 --> 1:24:39.074
Um, if I hug you,

1:24:39.074 --> 1:24:40.858
I'm gonna sob, so no.

1:24:40.858 --> 1:24:42.381
Well, I can handle that.

1:24:42.381 --> 1:24:44.427
No, I shouldn't. Not in front
of Ryan.

1:24:44.427 --> 1:24:45.950
Okay.

1:24:45.950 --> 1:24:47.821
Well, I'm hugging you
with my eyes.

1:24:48.257 --> 1:24:49.214
Thank you.

1:24:50.476 --> 1:24:51.869
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1:24:56.047 --> 1:24:58.789
I have to go.
So, I'll see you another time.

1:24:59.137 --> 1:24:59.964
Bye.

1:25:02.445 --> 1:25:03.576
Fuck me.

1:25:04.011 --> 1:25:04.969
Hey.

1:25:05.361 --> 1:25:06.449
Let's go.

1:25:06.449 --> 1:25:07.972
This asshole
charged me six buck

1:25:07.972 --> 1:25:09.016
for a cup of coffee. Come on.

1:25:11.236 --> 1:25:13.978

1:26:34.014 --> 1:26:35.059
Allie?

1:26:35.059 --> 1:26:36.843
Did you job hunt today?

1:26:40.978 --> 1:26:42.371
Please leave me alone.

1:26:43.110 --> 1:26:45.461
I was looking on Etsy.

1:26:45.461 --> 1:26:47.550
And I was thinking
it would be so cute

1:26:47.550 --> 1:26:49.378
if we found, like,
a craft that we like.

1:26:49.378 --> 1:26:51.597
And maybe we could
make a little money.
What do you think?

1:27:08.310 --> 1:27:09.702
I was thinking
it'd be so cute

1:27:09.702 --> 1:27:11.574
if it was like something fun
that we could sell.

1:27:11.574 --> 1:27:15.491
Like little bibs for babies
that catch their food,

1:27:15.491 --> 1:27:18.102
or salad dressing.

1:27:18.102 --> 1:27:20.409
Or you know, just...

1:27:22.062 --> 1:27:23.325
And you know what?

1:27:23.325 --> 1:27:25.196
We could be on <i>Shark Tank!</i>

1:27:25.196 --> 1:27:27.067
Can you imagine, Allie?

1:27:27.067 --> 1:27:28.286
And I know you're like,

1:27:28.286 --> 1:27:30.593
"Oh, shut up, Mom!
You're drunk again."

1:27:30.593 --> 1:27:31.724
But listen...

1:27:42.431 --> 1:27:44.433
Ooh, I just thought
of the best idea!

1:27:44.433 --> 1:27:47.436
We could do, um, papier-mache!

1:27:48.263 --> 1:27:49.829
Papier-mache!

1:27:49.829 --> 1:27:51.527
So it would be like,

1:27:51.527 --> 1:27:53.311
do a little dance,
a little song.

1:27:53.311 --> 1:27:55.444
"Hey, Sharks! You know how
everybody likes papier-mache."

1:27:55.444 --> 1:27:58.882
I would be like,
"Hey, Sharks! Hey, Sharks!"

1:27:58.882 --> 1:28:01.363
Hey, Sharks! Oh... Sharks!"

1:28:01.363 --> 1:28:03.800
Wait, that's too hard.
We'll be like,

1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:07.586
"I'm Diane.
This is my associate, Allison.

1:28:07.586 --> 1:28:12.722
"And this is our... whatever!"
You know...

1:28:13.897 --> 1:28:15.725
You weak piece
of fucking shit.

1:28:15.725 --> 1:28:17.770
You couldn't make it go
two days.

1:28:19.032 --> 1:28:20.512
I fucking hate you.

1:28:21.339 --> 1:28:24.777
I hate you so much.

1:28:24.777 --> 1:28:27.563
Allie, do you remember
when you were in fourth grade,

1:28:27.563 --> 1:28:30.043
you made
that giant mitochondria?

1:28:30.043 --> 1:28:35.005
That's something that
would sell, I promise you.

1:28:35.005 --> 1:28:37.616
We could be like,
"Hey, Sharks!"

1:28:37.616 --> 1:28:40.140
We got them for you!
Papier-mache!"

1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:43.796
You know, like all the...

1:28:51.195 --> 1:28:53.937
I knew you would like
that idea! I knew it!

1:30:21.416 --> 1:30:22.417
Yes!

1:30:24.419 --> 1:30:25.942
You're on the wrong side.

1:30:26.725 --> 1:30:28.597
What? No, I'm not.

1:30:31.730 --> 1:30:33.297
Oh.

1:30:33.297 --> 1:30:34.820
Well, good thing you came!

1:30:34.820 --> 1:30:35.995
Oh, my God!

1:30:36.518 --> 1:30:37.867
Get over here.

1:30:37.867 --> 1:30:39.434
Whoo! Party!

1:30:58.191 --> 1:30:59.932
- Hello, Diane!
- Oh, hey!

1:30:59.932 --> 1:31:01.978
I don't know

1:31:01.978 --> 1:31:04.284
how much Allison has told you.

1:31:05.547 --> 1:31:07.505
But we've been going
to the same program.

1:31:07.505 --> 1:31:09.594
Oh, yeah, she said.
She told me, yeah.

1:31:10.508 --> 1:31:11.770
My granddaughter, Ryan,

1:31:11.770 --> 1:31:14.773
has taken an interest
in Allison and,

1:31:14.773 --> 1:31:16.471
well, now I can't find her.

1:31:16.471 --> 1:31:19.386
So I just thought I'd drop by
and see if she might be here.

1:31:20.649 --> 1:31:22.128
I tried texting them,

1:31:22.128 --> 1:31:25.480
but, you know,
they all go green.

1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:26.481
Do you know what that means?

1:31:26.481 --> 1:31:27.743
I have no idea.

1:31:27.743 --> 1:31:29.962
I hate when that happens,
when they go...

1:31:29.962 --> 1:31:31.398
It's all green

1:31:31.398 --> 1:31:32.965
and you don't know
if it's sent. It's so weird.

1:31:32.965 --> 1:31:34.750
Right. Right. Right.
- Drives me crazy.

1:31:34.750 --> 1:31:36.491
You'll have to let me know
if you figure that out.

1:31:38.493 --> 1:31:40.146
I'm not tech-y.

1:31:40.146 --> 1:31:43.585
But I actually tonight was
trying to find Allison myself.

1:31:43.585 --> 1:31:45.674
But do you really think
they're together tonight?

1:31:47.502 --> 1:31:49.373
Both missing
at the same time. It...

1:31:50.592 --> 1:31:52.202
seems a little curious.

1:31:52.202 --> 1:31:54.509
Seems like
no matter how old they get,

1:31:54.509 --> 1:31:56.815
- you never stop worrying.
- Yeah.

1:31:56.815 --> 1:31:58.251
But they always seem
to turn up.

1:31:59.731 --> 1:32:00.950
Not always.

1:32:02.821 --> 1:32:04.301
Yeah.

1:32:04.301 --> 1:32:07.086
Well, can you let me know
if you find them?

1:32:07.086 --> 1:32:08.610
- I will.
- Great.

1:32:10.612 --> 1:32:11.526
Thank you.

1:32:12.396 --> 1:32:13.832
What's that?

1:32:13.832 --> 1:32:15.007
Oh, I was just... I...

1:32:15.007 --> 1:32:17.183
I was just saying
thank you so much

1:32:17.183 --> 1:32:19.490
for being so kind to Allison.

1:32:19.490 --> 1:32:22.798
She said you've always been
so warm to her and you know,

1:32:22.798 --> 1:32:26.149
I... just wanted to say thanks,
'cause, you know,

1:32:26.149 --> 1:32:29.848
like, some people
wouldn't be like that, so...

1:32:29.848 --> 1:32:33.591
Well, we're all just trying
to move on, I suppose.

1:32:33.591 --> 1:32:34.897
Yeah.

1:32:34.897 --> 1:32:36.028
I don't think
Allie and I are doing

1:32:36.028 --> 1:32:37.813
a very good job of that, Daniel.

1:32:39.205 --> 1:32:40.555
You know what they say.

1:32:40.555 --> 1:32:42.339
What?

1:32:42.339 --> 1:32:45.081
"Comparison
is the thief of joy."

1:32:45.081 --> 1:32:47.431
Oh. I didn't know
they said that.

1:32:48.867 --> 1:32:49.912
Well...

1:32:51.087 --> 1:32:52.392
somebody did.

1:32:52.392 --> 1:32:54.351
Yeah.

1:32:55.831 --> 1:32:57.441
Well, I best be going then.

1:32:57.441 --> 1:32:58.877

good intentions.

1:35:45.130 --> 1:35:47.219
No offense, but you weren't
supposed to come.

1:35:47.219 --> 1:35:49.352

1:36:24.039 --> 1:36:26.432
Why the fuck
did you just do that?

1:36:26.432 --> 1:36:28.478
I thought it was gonna
make you happy.

1:36:28.478 --> 1:36:31.524
You thought
that would make me happy?

1:36:31.524 --> 1:36:33.265
Yeah!
- Are you insane?

1:36:33.265 --> 1:36:35.441
Hi! Can I please get, um...
Hey, I'm sorry.

1:36:35.441 --> 1:36:38.140
Could I just get a glass
of tequila, please?

1:36:38.140 --> 1:36:39.445
Fuck, I can't breathe.

1:36:39.445 --> 1:36:40.751
- Ryan, I can't fucking breathe!
- Calm down.

1:36:40.751 --> 1:36:42.579
Calm down, okay? I'm sorry.

1:36:42.579 --> 1:36:44.711
You fucking did that
on purpose!

1:36:44.711 --> 1:36:46.017
You did that to hurt me, right?

1:36:46.017 --> 1:36:47.845
Is that what you did?
Yeah, you did.

1:36:47.845 --> 1:36:49.325
- Just admit it. Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't!

1:36:49.325 --> 1:36:50.892
- You did that
on fucking purpose!
- No, I didn't!

1:36:50.892 --> 1:36:53.851

1:36:53.851 --> 1:36:56.288

You're gonna be so famous!

1:37:02.251 --> 1:37:04.949
I know. I really have to savor
my anonymity.

1:37:04.949 --> 1:37:08.692
Hey, we're gonna go to this
party over in Williamsburg.

1:37:08.692 --> 1:37:10.215
You guys wanna come?

1:37:11.826 --> 1:37:13.610
Fuck, yeah, whatever.
Let's go!

1:37:13.610 --> 1:37:14.785
I need to get outta here.

1:37:21.052 --> 1:37:22.837
Do you have the time?

1:37:22.837 --> 1:37:24.708
- Yeah.

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:30.453
Hey, Danny. Everything okay?

1:37:30.453 --> 1:37:34.196
I can't find Ryan.
I've tried everything.

1:37:34.196 --> 1:37:38.156
Anyway, my mind
can't help but wonder if...

1:37:38.156 --> 1:37:40.419
Well, if you've seen Allison
or not.

1:37:40.419 --> 1:37:43.683
Uh, no, I haven't, but I can
text her if you want.

1:37:43.683 --> 1:37:45.076
Well, I've tried texting
both of them,

1:37:45.076 --> 1:37:46.469
but neither one is answering.

1:37:46.469 --> 1:37:47.687
What's wrong?

1:37:47.687 --> 1:37:49.124
Daniel can't find
his granddaughter.

1:37:49.124 --> 1:37:51.517
Um, well, if he pays for
the phone, he can just log

1:37:51.517 --> 1:37:53.128
into the account,
and use Find My Phone.

1:37:53.128 --> 1:37:55.565
Yeah. Daniel, do you know
what Find My Phone is?

1:37:55.565 --> 1:37:57.045
No, what the hell is that?

1:37:58.873 --> 1:38:01.136
This is amazing!

1:38:01.919 --> 1:38:05.705
Whoa!

1:38:28.119 --> 1:38:29.120
Fuck!

1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:34.125
Allie, this is Jarvis. He has
the stuff you asked for.

1:38:34.125 --> 1:38:35.387
Hey!

1:38:35.387 --> 1:38:37.128
I don't have any thirties,
just dope.

1:38:37.128 --> 1:38:40.131
Uh, yeah, okay.
Yeah, whatever you have.

1:38:41.959 --> 1:38:43.656
Can you spot me?

1:38:43.656 --> 1:38:45.745
- I'll pay you back, I promise.
- Uh, okay, all right.

1:38:52.578 --> 1:38:53.579
Thanks.

1:39:01.674 --> 1:39:03.241
It's coming. Look like!

1:39:06.592 --> 1:39:07.550
Yeah, here it is.

1:39:07.550 --> 1:39:08.725
Okay, what does it say?

1:39:16.689 --> 1:39:19.388
- The whole room is spinning.

1:39:21.346 --> 1:39:22.869
Oh, that's my phone.

1:39:24.132 --> 1:39:25.394
Don't worry about it.

1:39:27.265 --> 1:39:29.964
Can we just stop for a second?

1:39:29.964 --> 1:39:31.356
Where is my phone?

1:39:33.445 --> 1:39:35.056
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1:39:38.015 --> 1:39:39.277
What the fuck!

1:39:40.626 --> 1:39:42.889
She's in the fucking city!

1:39:42.889 --> 1:39:45.109
She's in fucking Williamsburg!

1:39:45.109 --> 1:39:47.198
Okay, Daniel, wait.
I'm gonna come pick you up.

1:39:47.198 --> 1:39:49.157
I don't want you to do
something you're gonna regret.

1:39:49.157 --> 1:39:50.854
I'm gonna kill
that motherfucker.

1:39:50.854 --> 1:39:52.682
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
worried about. I'm on my way.

1:40:06.391 --> 1:40:08.959
- Okay. Easy does it.

1:40:08.959 --> 1:40:10.961
- You're wasted.
- No, I'm not.

1:40:13.398 --> 1:40:14.486
Ryan?

1:40:39.163 --> 1:40:40.382
Ryan?

1:40:44.603 --> 1:40:46.344
- Ryan, are you in there?

1:40:46.344 --> 1:40:48.694
She's fine.
Go the fuck away!

1:40:48.694 --> 1:40:49.869
Ryan?

1:40:58.269 --> 1:40:59.357
Ryan?

1:41:00.837 --> 1:41:03.057
Can you just
open the door, please?

1:41:05.363 --> 1:41:06.364
Ryan.

1:41:06.364 --> 1:41:07.583
Go away!

1:41:07.583 --> 1:41:09.802
Allison? Where's Ryan?

1:41:09.802 --> 1:41:11.282
What're you doing here?

1:41:11.282 --> 1:41:13.545
Where the fuck is Ryan?

1:41:13.545 --> 1:41:15.852
She's in here. I'm trying to...
She won't answer.

1:41:15.852 --> 1:41:16.940
- Ryan!

1:41:17.897 --> 1:41:18.942
Ryan?

1:41:20.378 --> 1:41:22.076
It's your grandpa,
open the door.

1:41:23.294 --> 1:41:24.774
Open the door, baby.

1:41:24.774 --> 1:41:26.080
Fuck off!

1:41:28.212 --> 1:41:30.258
- What the fuck!
Ryan!

1:41:30.258 --> 1:41:32.912
You again!
Get the fuck up!

1:41:32.912 --> 1:41:34.088
- Danny, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God!

1:41:34.088 --> 1:41:35.654
- Don't do that!
- Nothing happened.

1:41:35.654 --> 1:41:38.222
Tell me why I shouldn't
kill you, motherfucker?

1:41:38.222 --> 1:41:39.658
We were just making out.

1:41:39.658 --> 1:41:40.877
You hurt my baby.

1:41:43.532 --> 1:41:45.229
- Now, I'm gonna hurt you.

1:41:45.229 --> 1:41:46.665
- No, no, no, no, no.
Danny!

1:41:47.623 --> 1:41:48.537
Dad!

1:41:49.059 --> 1:41:50.930
No!

1:41:50.930 --> 1:41:53.455
The hell you're doing here?
This is family business.

1:41:53.455 --> 1:41:55.109
Don't do this.

1:41:55.109 --> 1:41:57.111
Go on back
to your new life, Nate.

1:41:57.111 --> 1:41:58.764
Put the gun down, please.

1:41:58.764 --> 1:42:00.114
Please, please!

1:42:00.114 --> 1:42:01.506
He's not worth it.

1:42:01.506 --> 1:42:03.769
I got nothing left to lose.

1:42:03.769 --> 1:42:05.075
You got me!

1:42:06.424 --> 1:42:07.512
You got Ryan!

1:42:08.296 --> 1:42:09.688
We need you!

1:42:09.688 --> 1:42:11.951
You do this, it's over!

1:42:14.345 --> 1:42:15.955
We get no more time.

1:42:15.955 --> 1:42:18.088
Danny,
put the gun down.

1:42:20.264 --> 1:42:21.265
Please.

1:42:28.577 --> 1:42:29.578
Oh, my...

1:42:31.188 --> 1:42:32.233
That's my niece.

1:42:32.929 --> 1:42:34.365
She's 16 years old.

1:42:36.324 --> 1:42:37.716
Oh, my God! All right,
we gotta get out of here.

1:42:37.716 --> 1:42:38.848
Hey, Ryan, baby?

1:42:38.848 --> 1:42:40.415
- Please get up.
- My fucking nose!

1:42:40.415 --> 1:42:43.418
Get over here!
My fucking nose!

1:42:56.648 --> 1:42:58.172
The fuck is the matter
with you?

1:42:58.172 --> 1:42:59.608
I was trying to protect her!

1:42:59.608 --> 1:43:01.000
Protect her?
- Yeah!

1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.264
I told you to stay away
from her!

1:43:03.264 --> 1:43:04.526
Who the fuck are you

1:43:04.526 --> 1:43:06.049
to be talking
about protecting somebody?

1:43:06.049 --> 1:43:07.659
- You're a mess.
- Dad!

1:43:07.659 --> 1:43:10.096
I was... I was trying to help.

1:43:10.096 --> 1:43:11.620
I was... I was trying to...

1:43:12.447 --> 1:43:13.883
I was trying to make it right.

1:43:13.883 --> 1:43:15.276
Let me tell you something.

1:43:15.972 --> 1:43:17.626
You will never ever

1:43:17.626 --> 1:43:19.758
be able to fix the things
you've done to me.

1:43:20.933 --> 1:43:22.021
You hear me?

1:43:22.805 --> 1:43:24.459
I want my life back.

1:43:24.459 --> 1:43:25.721
I want my child back.

1:43:26.852 --> 1:43:29.464
My baby, my... Molly.

1:43:30.813 --> 1:43:32.336
You took my baby away from me!

1:43:32.336 --> 1:43:33.685
Dad! Enough.

1:43:33.685 --> 1:43:34.991
Nah, it's okay.

1:43:36.732 --> 1:43:37.733
Say it.

1:43:39.169 --> 1:43:40.605
Shit, I wanted to hate you.

1:43:41.998 --> 1:43:43.217
But I stopped myself.

1:43:45.871 --> 1:43:49.135
And when you walked into
that meeting, I thought...

1:43:50.136 --> 1:43:52.443
This is God testing me.

1:43:52.443 --> 1:43:56.839
This is proof of a higher power

1:43:56.839 --> 1:43:59.058
testing me in this church.

1:44:00.756 --> 1:44:02.148
Trying to see
if he could break me.

1:44:03.237 --> 1:44:04.368
But I'll show him.

1:44:07.066 --> 1:44:08.242
I'm unbreakable.

1:44:09.765 --> 1:44:11.593
I will offer my hand

1:44:12.289 --> 1:44:13.899
to this sorry

1:44:14.726 --> 1:44:18.643
little fucking pill-junkie.

1:44:18.643 --> 1:44:21.820
All I asked you to do
was stay away from this child.

1:44:23.300 --> 1:44:24.345
Now look at her.

1:44:25.694 --> 1:44:26.956
She got no mother.

1:44:29.132 --> 1:44:30.133
No father.

1:44:32.222 --> 1:44:34.180
And how many years
can I have left?

1:44:36.531 --> 1:44:38.881
What a fucking waste you are.

1:44:39.229 --> 1:44:40.143
Dad!

1:44:40.143 --> 1:44:43.189
What a fucking waste of a soul.

1:44:45.279 --> 1:44:46.541
Of a chance.

1:44:46.541 --> 1:44:48.891
Danny, enough.
You've said your piece.

1:44:48.891 --> 1:44:50.806
This isn't
how it was supposed to be.

1:44:52.851 --> 1:44:54.026
I'm a good person.

1:44:55.985 --> 1:44:58.161
I never said
God has to be fair.

1:44:58.944 --> 1:45:00.076
I just never thought

1:45:01.686 --> 1:45:02.992
he could be this cruel.

1:45:06.604 --> 1:45:07.910
Taxi!

1:45:07.910 --> 1:45:09.346
Hold on, Danny,
let me take you home.

1:45:09.346 --> 1:45:10.434
No.

1:45:10.434 --> 1:45:13.437
I'll go with him.
Hey! Hey, Ryan!

1:45:13.437 --> 1:45:15.874
Come on, wake up.
We're taking you home.

1:45:29.192 --> 1:45:31.281
You drank!

1:45:31.281 --> 1:45:35.329
You turned your map app
back on at 17:36:22.

1:45:36.634 --> 1:45:39.724
Impact was at 17:36:24.

1:45:41.247 --> 1:45:45.208
Skid marks show you lost
30 feet before you swerved.

1:45:46.383 --> 1:45:49.212
You didn't have time to stop

1:45:49.212 --> 1:45:52.041
because you were looking at
your fucking phone, Allison.

1:45:53.564 --> 1:45:55.087
Stop blaming Alvarez.

1:45:56.524 --> 1:45:58.482
They're dead because of you.

1:46:17.893 --> 1:46:19.895
All right. All right.
It's all right.

1:46:19.895 --> 1:46:21.200
Come here. Come here.

1:46:22.898 --> 1:46:25.074
It's all right. Okay.

1:46:28.207 --> 1:46:29.644
<i>No, that can't go
over there.</i>

1:46:29.644 --> 1:46:31.210
That can't...

1:46:32.211 --> 1:46:34.300
That can't... That can't go...

1:47:30.313 --> 1:47:31.575
Good morning.

1:47:32.315 --> 1:47:33.490
Good morning.

1:47:34.839 --> 1:47:36.406
I made a house.

1:47:38.669 --> 1:47:40.018
Do you have a headache?

1:47:42.543 --> 1:47:43.544
Yeah.

1:47:49.506 --> 1:47:50.986
Hey.

1:47:50.986 --> 1:47:53.031
Can I, uh, sell this, please?

1:48:02.476 --> 1:48:03.564
I'll give you $12,500.

1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:06.392
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Thank you.

One of the girls on the team

1:50:20.352 --> 1:50:21.832
invited me to a party
this weekend.

1:50:22.180 --> 1:50:23.486
You?

Hi.

1:51:10.707 --> 1:51:11.708
Hi.

1:51:15.973 --> 1:51:17.496
Thank you so much for coming.

1:51:18.628 --> 1:51:19.542
Sure.

1:51:24.068 --> 1:51:25.679
- You look great.

1:51:26.592 --> 1:51:27.855
I nearly put makeup on,

1:51:27.855 --> 1:51:29.987
and then I just laughed
at myself.

1:51:32.337 --> 1:51:33.382
Do you like my clips?

1:51:34.122 --> 1:51:35.645
Wow, yeah.

1:51:35.645 --> 1:51:37.081
I stole them from a pharmacy.

1:51:37.821 --> 1:51:38.909
- Not recently.

1:51:38.909 --> 1:51:41.085
- Like, a while back.

1:51:45.481 --> 1:51:46.743
I don't know where to start.

1:51:46.743 --> 1:51:47.744
That's okay.

1:51:48.310 --> 1:51:49.920
Um, I'll start.

1:51:57.536 --> 1:51:59.234
Nate, I didn't have...

1:52:01.410 --> 1:52:02.890
the faintest idea

1:52:04.413 --> 1:52:06.371
how to handle my own grief.

1:52:09.810 --> 1:52:12.377
I didn't even know
if I was allowed to grieve.

1:52:12.377 --> 1:52:14.728
We were all flailing.

1:52:14.728 --> 1:52:16.904
Yeah, but I abandoned you,

1:52:18.035 --> 1:52:19.689
and that was so selfish.

1:52:22.126 --> 1:52:24.433
I ran as fast as I could
away from you.

1:52:25.608 --> 1:52:27.610
I still wanted you
to be my wife.

1:52:29.090 --> 1:52:30.134
I know.

1:52:35.052 --> 1:52:37.185
But the truth is, Nate, I...

1:52:39.274 --> 1:52:40.884
I was so sure

1:52:42.364 --> 1:52:43.234
I was gonna...

1:52:47.499 --> 1:52:49.632
- try...
- I know.

1:52:51.765 --> 1:52:53.114
And you know I tried.

1:52:55.594 --> 1:52:57.379
I tried, but I couldn't.

1:52:59.903 --> 1:53:01.775
'Cause I didn't wanna
hurt you again.

1:53:01.775 --> 1:53:03.559
It wasn't your fault.

1:53:03.559 --> 1:53:04.734
It was.

1:53:06.475 --> 1:53:07.868
Your dad was right.

1:53:09.478 --> 1:53:10.827
If I hadn't been looking
at my phone,

1:53:10.827 --> 1:53:12.350
I could have stopped in time.

1:53:16.659 --> 1:53:19.705
You deserve an apology that
never came, and I'm so sorry.

1:53:24.362 --> 1:53:25.494
I'm really sorry.

1:53:32.327 --> 1:53:34.242
I've been spending some time
with him lately.

1:53:34.242 --> 1:53:35.286
Yeah.

1:53:36.592 --> 1:53:39.116
- Oh, it's a work-in-progress.

1:53:40.335 --> 1:53:41.336
Good.

1:53:44.730 --> 1:53:46.297
He kept me alive, you know.

1:53:50.345 --> 1:53:51.607
I know about your ear.

1:53:57.569 --> 1:54:02.096
Hey... I need you
to be clear on one thing.

1:54:04.881 --> 1:54:06.448
I loved you so much.

1:54:10.191 --> 1:54:11.845
And along
with everything else,

1:54:13.324 --> 1:54:14.804
I will forever grieve

1:54:14.804 --> 1:54:17.067
for the life that we might
have had.

1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:21.028
Me too.

1:54:24.596 --> 1:54:26.816
- We were a good team.

1:54:28.209 --> 1:54:30.080
It would be nice

1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:31.995
if we could one day
find some way

1:54:31.995 --> 1:54:33.867
to be in each other's lives.

1:54:34.824 --> 1:54:36.391
Maybe that's unrealistic,

1:54:36.391 --> 1:54:37.609
- but...
- Maybe.

1:54:38.741 --> 1:54:39.698
Yeah.

1:54:41.352 --> 1:54:42.527
Maybe.

1:54:53.712 --> 1:54:55.453
I think
we can all thank Elaine.

1:54:55.453 --> 1:54:57.064
Thank you so much.

1:54:57.064 --> 1:54:59.327
I really appreciated
getting to know you,

1:54:59.327 --> 1:55:01.416
and talking to you.

1:55:01.416 --> 1:55:04.114
Everybody, our deeply
inappropriate stories

1:55:04.114 --> 1:55:05.507
- from yesterday...

1:55:05.507 --> 1:55:08.684
...have been well in my head.
King's laughing.

1:55:08.684 --> 1:55:11.078
Your stories are foul.

1:55:12.383 --> 1:55:13.994
Mama,

1:55:13.994 --> 1:55:15.299
I'm so grateful for you.

1:55:15.299 --> 1:55:17.432
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

1:55:17.432 --> 1:55:18.912
And I love you.

1:55:28.922 --> 1:55:31.925
The food was terrible.
Thank you.

Um, I recently recorded
my first EP,

1:57:12.938 --> 1:57:14.375
and it's at the coat check

1:57:14.375 --> 1:57:16.855

the coat check girl.

1:57:16.855 --> 1:57:19.032

1:57:19.032 --> 1:57:20.555

your coats back.

1:57:31.870 --> 1:57:33.655
Hi.

1:57:33.655 --> 1:57:35.657
I know you're calling
about my one-year clean,

1:57:35.657 --> 1:57:37.833
but I need to tell you
what I just did.

1:57:40.575 --> 1:57:42.098
Yeah. No, I can talk.

1:57:43.882 --> 1:57:44.796
Okay.

1:57:57.983 --> 1:57:59.246
Hey, Dwayne.

1:57:59.246 --> 1:58:00.769
Could you take these
to the kitchen for me?

1:58:00.769 --> 1:58:02.423
Thank you so much.

1:58:05.165 --> 1:58:06.862
She'll give it back.
Right, Ryan?

1:58:06.862 --> 1:58:08.342
- That's nice.
Thank you.

1:58:08.342 --> 1:58:11.649
Hey. How's it going?
Ooh, wait, I have cupcakes.

1:58:11.649 --> 1:58:13.999
- Need any help?
- No, no, no. I'm all good.
Thank you.

1:58:13.999 --> 1:58:14.957
Actually, we broke up

1:58:14.957 --> 1:58:16.176
- a few months ago.
- Yeah...

1:58:16.176 --> 1:58:17.481
Hey, Mama.
- Yes?

1:58:17.481 --> 1:58:20.180
Could you go pass these around
over there?

1:58:20.180 --> 1:58:21.311
I think they would like some.

1:58:21.311 --> 1:58:22.573
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1:58:22.573 --> 1:58:24.749
- Ooh, they smell so good.
- They are good.

- Amor fati <i>is Latin.</i>

2:00:37.534 --> 2:00:39.710
