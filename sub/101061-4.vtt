WEBVTT

00:11.500 --> 00:16.125
THE ORIGIN

01:01.833 --> 01:05.083
We're attracted to the dark
like moths to light.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.833
We are born out of the darkness

01:11.916 --> 01:13.833
and we return to it.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.250
You've grown, Tronte.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.125
Do we know each other?

01:33.250 --> 01:34.708
I knew your mother.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.833
But that was a long time ago.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.041
You take after her.

01:46.791 --> 01:47.875
Your eyes.

01:48.958 --> 01:49.958
Who are you?

01:53.083 --> 01:54.583
I don't have a name.

01:56.458 --> 01:58.250
I was never given one.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.625
But I chose your name back then.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.375
It belonged to your mother.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.833
I think it should belong to you now.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.791
I have to go now.

05:06.791 --> 05:07.708
I love you.

05:23.416 --> 05:25.291
I don't know if you'll like it, but...

05:31.750 --> 05:33.041
May I put it on you?

05:45.125 --> 05:46.416
You don't like it?

05:47.041 --> 05:48.000
No, I...

05:49.041 --> 05:51.541
I do, it's very beautiful.

05:52.625 --> 05:53.750
I don't know.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.875
I haven't felt quite right all week.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.583
You look pale.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.250
Maybe you should see a doctor.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.416
Will I see you later?

06:05.208 --> 06:07.416
I... I don't know. It's...

06:08.583 --> 06:11.166
I think it's best if I stay home tonight.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.333
Katharina...

06:21.875 --> 06:24.625
I'm glad you decided to stay here.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.125
In Winden.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.000
You're beautiful.

07:00.208 --> 07:04.833
SEPTEMBER 24, 1954

07:04.916 --> 07:08.000
SENSATIONAL NUDE PHOTOS

07:09.000 --> 07:10.416
Her facial expression...

07:11.250 --> 07:12.333
KESS
THE EXHILARATING MAGAZINE

07:13.166 --> 07:14.791
Where did you get it?

07:17.208 --> 07:21.083
-I found it in my dad's stuff.
-Ines, Claudia.Â We're already late.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.708
My dad says you don't learn
anything in school.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.375
You only learn from life.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.833
Why don't they have these with men?

07:31.041 --> 07:34.291
-I don't think it's fair at all.
-You're crazy.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.375
Have you ever seen one?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.833
-I mean, that's not your dad's?
-Ines!

07:41.958 --> 07:43.541
Jana, don't be like that.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.958
And what did it look like?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.166
Peculiar.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.125
As if it didn't belong to the rest of him.

08:00.666 --> 08:01.625
Tronte?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.625
I think he's a strange boy.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.541
Is his mother back?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.541
It's odd. Don't you think?

08:20.916 --> 08:22.833
To just disappear like that?

08:26.541 --> 08:30.333
POLICE

08:34.500 --> 08:35.416
Doris.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.916
What are you doing here?

08:39.291 --> 08:41.875
I want to talk to you.
Mr. Kahnwald let me in.

08:42.250 --> 08:45.916
Where have you been?
I thought you left early to write reports.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.875
It...

08:52.166 --> 08:53.083
I...

08:54.041 --> 08:56.000
Something came up.

08:59.666 --> 09:00.875
This morning...

09:01.791 --> 09:04.291
I did the laundry and I found something.

09:08.666 --> 09:09.500
Here.

09:09.791 --> 09:13.000
It was between one of her blouses.
I thought it might help out.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.875
She said her husband was a man of God.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.291
And maybe it's just a coincidence, but...

09:37.375 --> 09:40.083
the minister who disappeared
at the same time...

09:40.625 --> 09:42.416
His name is Hanno Tauber.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.333
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER
HANNO TAUBER (42) FROM VECHTA

09:49.416 --> 09:50.250
I...

09:51.750 --> 09:53.500
I thought her husband was dead.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.750
It's been three months.

09:57.208 --> 10:00.333
You don't just leave your child behind
without a word.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.708
You should go home.
We're taking care of it.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.625
Egon! I know something happened.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.250
Why would she leave all this behind?

10:17.416 --> 10:20.166
Who knows what goes on inside
the heads of you women?

10:30.291 --> 10:31.125
Doris!

10:39.125 --> 10:41.333
MISSING SINCE JUNE 26, 1954
MRS. AGNES NIELSEN

10:41.416 --> 10:42.916
HAS ANYONE SEEN THIS WOMAN?

10:54.208 --> 10:56.625
You chose the right side.

11:00.875 --> 11:01.958
Don't forget that.

11:10.958 --> 11:13.083
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

11:13.166 --> 11:15.125
You have to give this to Claudia.

11:17.291 --> 11:18.541
When it's time.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.166
Life is a gift...

11:31.833 --> 11:34.500
for those who know how to use it.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.708
Are you going to tell Martha?

11:41.083 --> 11:42.833
What the origin really is?

12:18.750 --> 12:21.000
All of these years, I've wondered...

12:23.958 --> 12:26.875
why you ditched us in 1888.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.375
Why you helped us create the matter...

12:36.000 --> 12:38.041
and then simply disappeared.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.625
Who would've thought that 33 years later

12:52.708 --> 12:54.958
it would be us who gave you the order.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.250
Magnus...

12:58.291 --> 12:59.458
I'm sorry.

13:01.791 --> 13:03.333
It doesn't matter anymore.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.416
Adam is waiting for us.

13:20.375 --> 13:25.833
NOVEMBER 6, 2052

13:28.916 --> 13:30.750
This is your future.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.625
Thirty-three years away
from your yesterday.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.291
The door in the cave...

13:48.416 --> 13:49.333
What is that?

13:51.458 --> 13:55.375
It is a path
that connects past and future.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.458
Why are these names crossed out?

14:10.791 --> 14:12.583
It means they die.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.083
All of them.

14:16.458 --> 14:19.125
-What do you mean, they all die?
-In two days.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.458
The apocalypse in his world

14:23.083 --> 14:24.916
also happens in ours.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.583
This isn't real.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.958
You're not real.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.708
This is your future.

14:42.416 --> 14:43.333
If you...

14:43.666 --> 14:46.958
If the both of you fail
to stop the apocalypse.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.541
So you haven't been in Winden long?

15:00.375 --> 15:01.541
Three months.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.208
I like it here.

15:04.625 --> 15:07.833
It's much less complicated
than where I'm from.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.708
Well, maybe that's about to change.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.375
You're pregnant.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.625
At your age,
a pregnancy is not without risks.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.083
You should take care of yourself.
No hard work.

15:32.416 --> 15:33.708
That's impossible.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.000
Listen.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.583
Some gifts come into our lives
unexpectedly.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.333
Yet they're still gifts.

16:24.458 --> 16:25.458
Mrs. Doppler.

16:35.916 --> 16:37.125
How can I help you?

16:37.833 --> 16:40.583
I'd like to know if there is any news.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.166
I'm afraid...

16:43.833 --> 16:45.166
I'm afraid not.

16:47.125 --> 16:51.083
Unless Helge decides
to tell us where he was...

16:51.166 --> 16:52.083
That is...

16:52.708 --> 16:54.291
whom he was with...

16:55.708 --> 16:57.666
I'm afraid we're stuck.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.666
This isn't about Helge.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.625
This is about the missing minister.

17:06.833 --> 17:09.291
The congregation has been
without support for weeks.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.250
It leaves the door open for the devil.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.166
You knew the man?

17:20.208 --> 17:21.083
The minister?

17:25.791 --> 17:26.625
Did he...

17:30.708 --> 17:33.958
Did you ever see him
in the company of a woman?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.541
What are you thinking?

17:41.708 --> 17:43.708
I want you to find the man.

17:44.875 --> 17:46.375
Hanno Tauber.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.708
Sorry to disturb you.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.458
Are you the new minister?

18:31.708 --> 18:33.375
I once was.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.166
But it's been a long time.

18:39.916 --> 18:42.583
The thing is, I'm looking for someone.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.916
My husband and I,

18:46.291 --> 18:50.083
our daughter is very talented,
and last winter we sublet the guest room

18:50.625 --> 18:54.083
so we could save up money for Claudia,
for when she goes to college.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.000
The woman who moved in with us,

18:56.333 --> 18:58.500
she disappeared, three months ago.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.500
Her husband was a man of God.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.583
She said he died.

19:06.666 --> 19:09.958
I don't know why,
but I got the impression that wasn't true.

19:10.041 --> 19:14.125
And the man who was the minister here
disappeared at the same time, so...

19:14.583 --> 19:16.875
What if he was her husband?

19:17.333 --> 19:19.458
And she went back to him?

19:19.958 --> 19:22.583
I don't think she liked him very much.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.500
Not all human connections

19:25.958 --> 19:28.416
are formed out of fondness.

19:30.583 --> 19:32.291
Well, it's about the boy.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.375
He's still with us, and...

19:35.041 --> 19:36.916
a boy needs his mother.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.791
With every lie

19:41.708 --> 19:45.541
the human soul dies just a little bit.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.666
I don't understand.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You're not interested in the boy.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.583
You're interested in the woman.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.291
I think you've misunderstood me.

20:00.375 --> 20:03.375
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.541
It does what it wants.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.875
Just ask your husband.

20:16.791 --> 20:18.583
He'll tell you the same thing.

20:20.708 --> 20:21.666
My husband?

20:24.125 --> 20:28.708
Haven't you wondered why he's been leaving
the house so early lately?

20:30.041 --> 20:32.708
Why he's been working so late?

20:36.875 --> 20:39.416
Couldn't the reason be another woman?

20:47.875 --> 20:50.416
It's difficult for us to let go...

20:52.333 --> 20:56.791
of what we desire deep within ourselves.

21:58.791 --> 21:59.916
Hello, Tronte.

22:03.791 --> 22:04.625
Hello.

22:21.291 --> 22:22.541
What's that?

22:23.291 --> 22:24.708
It's so beautiful.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.000
Why weren't you at school today?

22:40.416 --> 22:41.833
What are you doing here?

22:44.625 --> 22:45.875
I like it here.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.291
It's so...

22:49.166 --> 22:50.208
desolate.

22:58.916 --> 23:00.458
I like to write, you know.

23:01.958 --> 23:02.791
Stories.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.250
You have a nice smile.

23:18.291 --> 23:22.083
POLICE

23:34.291 --> 23:35.500
What are you doing here?

23:44.250 --> 23:45.958
You can't just show up here.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.208
What if someone sees you?

23:53.416 --> 23:54.583
Is everything okay?

23:58.791 --> 23:59.833
I'm pregnant.

24:29.541 --> 24:31.541
I thought you were being careful.

24:42.041 --> 24:43.208
Is it mine?

24:55.666 --> 24:57.000
Is it yours?

24:59.708 --> 25:02.541
What do you think I do all day long?
Fuck around?

25:03.458 --> 25:05.416
Do you think I chose this?

25:05.500 --> 25:07.416
Living in this shithole?

25:09.083 --> 25:11.583
I thought you were harmless,
but you're all the same.

25:11.958 --> 25:15.041
You all think you own the world.
That you can take what you want.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.666
You eat and fuck and think you're God.

25:18.458 --> 25:21.416
Everywhere you go,
always the same fucking smug assholes.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.833
Katharina,
you don't know what you're saying.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.875
It's best if I drive you home now.

25:50.625 --> 25:53.416
The coal industry has him wrapped around
its little finger.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.666
I don't care how long it takes!

25:56.750 --> 25:59.166
We'll submit
another building permit request.

26:01.666 --> 26:05.708
Nuclear power is the future.
And the future cannot be stopped.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.125
I don't care what the mayor says!

26:14.875 --> 26:16.250
Oh, Claudia.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.166
Look at you.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.333
You're all grown up.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.791
A real lady.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.750
Pretty and smart as a whip.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.416
Helge will be pleased to see you.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.916
And, of course,
you'll be rewarded for your services.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.208
But that's far too much.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.500
Let me give you some advice.
A life lesson.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.625
If you really want something,

26:56.708 --> 26:57.958
then take it.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.958
Things don't just happen by themselves.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Thank you.

27:14.958 --> 27:17.750
NUCLEAR POWER AND PEACE

27:20.708 --> 27:24.708
TOWN HALL

27:44.958 --> 27:46.500
Is Heinz sick, or...

27:55.833 --> 27:57.166
What do you want?

28:14.791 --> 28:17.125
How much money
did the coal industry pay you

28:17.208 --> 28:19.708
to block the plans
for the nuclear power plant?

28:22.833 --> 28:24.833
I have no idea what you're talking about.

28:26.666 --> 28:28.416
So Doppler sent you, right?

28:31.041 --> 28:33.125
Do you know what money can't buy?

28:34.416 --> 28:35.541
The future.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.458
More precisely, your future.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.041
We think we're immortal,

28:44.750 --> 28:47.916
but, in truth, often only one breath...

28:49.583 --> 28:52.083
separates the now from the hereafter.

28:56.416 --> 28:57.916
What do you want from me?

29:04.708 --> 29:09.875
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

29:10.750 --> 29:13.250
BUILDING PERMIT

29:13.666 --> 29:16.166
The building permit
for the nuclear power plant, it's...

29:23.791 --> 29:25.208
To the future.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.583
You can change it.

29:30.666 --> 29:32.333
Both of you can change it.

29:32.416 --> 29:36.041
The barrels at the nuclear plant,
they trigger the apocalypse.

29:36.291 --> 29:38.708
You have to stop them from being opened.

29:40.875 --> 29:42.208
What do we do then?

29:43.291 --> 29:46.083
Eva said there's a way to undo this knot.

29:46.166 --> 29:48.625
That there's a way Martha can live.
My Martha!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.333
She lied to you.

29:56.375 --> 29:58.833
There is no way to save both worlds.

30:00.916 --> 30:03.000
You have to choose one of them.

30:05.125 --> 30:07.125
The apocalypse, in two days...

30:08.791 --> 30:10.250
it can be stopped.

30:12.291 --> 30:13.750
You two can stop it.

30:14.666 --> 30:16.791
They can live. All of them.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.333
Mikkel...

30:19.208 --> 30:20.208
can live.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.416
Isn't that what you wanted?

30:24.875 --> 30:26.875
But, in return, you have to let her go.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.416
Your Martha.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.333
Your world.

30:32.750 --> 30:35.000
You've seen what becomes of you there.

30:35.791 --> 30:37.125
What you'll do.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.208
What Adam will do.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.250
You're both out of your minds.

30:45.916 --> 30:48.708
I'm going home now,
and I'll wake up in my bed

30:48.791 --> 30:51.083
and all of this will have been
just a crappy dream.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.333
Jonas, this is exactly what you wanted.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.083
You and Martha.

30:59.500 --> 31:02.625
In this world,
the two of you are not impossible.

31:13.458 --> 31:14.333
Martha!

31:19.833 --> 31:20.666
Wait!

31:24.750 --> 31:25.583
Hey.

31:26.041 --> 31:26.875
Hey.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.083
You believe all of this?

31:42.375 --> 31:44.166
That they're all going to die?

31:59.750 --> 32:00.666
That's crazy.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.541
I'm crazy. This is...

32:20.708 --> 32:23.083
Believe me, I know exactly how it feels.

32:26.750 --> 32:27.958
It's all true?

32:34.083 --> 32:36.041
Everything she said is true?

32:43.791 --> 32:45.708
But I know there's a way.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.833
A way to straighten all this out again.

32:50.958 --> 32:53.250
And I'm not going to stop
looking for that way.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.166
I think that's what she's doing too.

32:59.166 --> 33:01.083
The Martha who brought me here.

33:24.833 --> 33:25.958
It's time.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.708
So you have no idea where your mom is?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.625
And the man this morning...

34:24.791 --> 34:27.041
You think that may have been your dad?

34:27.500 --> 34:29.708
My mother didn't talk about him much.

34:30.750 --> 34:31.916
She said...

34:33.000 --> 34:34.291
he's a bad person.

34:36.416 --> 34:38.333
I was in a home for a long time.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.291
What's it like in a home?

34:54.375 --> 34:56.166
Can you keep a secret?

34:58.250 --> 35:00.375
That man this morning...

35:01.041 --> 35:03.291
I don't even want to know if he's my dad.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.208
And I'm glad that my mother's gone.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.291
You can have it if you want.

35:21.708 --> 35:22.750
Jana?

35:23.916 --> 35:25.333
What are you doing here?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.375
Didn't you go home hours ago?

35:36.416 --> 35:39.166
We're already late.
I'm sure Mom is waiting with dinner.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.125
See you around.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.625
Maybe see you tomorrow.

36:04.416 --> 36:05.875
What do we do now?

36:18.375 --> 36:21.000
Don't worry. I don't want to keep it.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.125
Why do some people have everything?

36:30.791 --> 36:32.125
And others nothing?

36:33.666 --> 36:34.500
Hm?

36:35.666 --> 36:39.583
Why does destiny preordain all that's good
for some and not for others?

36:56.875 --> 37:00.375
All my life I've been trying to hold
onto things you can't hold onto.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.416
But now I finally understand.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.083
I don't need anyone.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.875
None of you.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.916
It's best you go now.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.041
Last year...

37:52.166 --> 37:53.666
Daniel told me about it.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.250
She does it properly.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.208
MRS. OBENDORF

38:12.833 --> 38:13.875
I'm sorry.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.750
You sent them off?

39:49.250 --> 39:51.000
The beginning is the end.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.833
And the end is the beginning.

39:55.875 --> 39:58.125
We are all born of him.

39:59.916 --> 40:01.666
You gave him life.

40:03.125 --> 40:04.916
And he will give us ours.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.166
Him.

40:09.166 --> 40:10.083
Agnes.

40:10.583 --> 40:11.500
Tronte.

40:12.375 --> 40:13.208
Jana.

40:13.916 --> 40:14.791
Ulrich.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.416
Katharina.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.041
You.

40:24.708 --> 40:27.166
A line without a beginning or an end.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.875
An infinite circle.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.541
Doris?

40:57.541 --> 40:58.708
Is everything okay?

41:40.625 --> 41:41.458
I...

41:42.083 --> 41:43.541
I wanted to apologize.

41:46.041 --> 41:47.166
For this morning.

41:50.458 --> 41:52.791
I know you just wanted to help.

41:59.416 --> 42:00.833
Lately, I...

42:05.291 --> 42:07.208
I haven't really been myself.

42:08.833 --> 42:09.916
Work and...

42:14.583 --> 42:15.583
I'm sorry.

42:20.875 --> 42:22.666
I know what you've been up to.

42:25.500 --> 42:26.625
With that woman.

42:29.541 --> 42:30.791
What do you mean?

42:34.208 --> 42:35.583
I want a divorce.

42:38.916 --> 42:40.541
What are you talking about?

42:45.500 --> 42:49.708
We should have done it sooner, but I...
I thought...

42:51.875 --> 42:53.791
I don't know what I thought.

42:55.666 --> 42:57.250
All these secrets.

42:59.291 --> 43:00.708
I don't want to live like this.

43:02.833 --> 43:03.666
I...

43:06.625 --> 43:08.083
I can explain it to you.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.000
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

43:14.958 --> 43:16.500
It does what it wants.

43:41.041 --> 43:41.875
Hello.

43:43.208 --> 43:46.541
I... I'm here to see Mrs. Obendorf.

44:05.666 --> 44:07.375
You have to wait.

44:27.750 --> 44:29.291
My mother says...

44:31.125 --> 44:32.708
they go to hell.

44:35.291 --> 44:36.250
The...

44:37.083 --> 44:38.708
The ones that are gotten rid of.

44:39.416 --> 44:40.833
I don't believe in hell.

44:43.791 --> 44:45.958
Hell is what we make for ourselves
on Earth.

44:51.750 --> 44:53.125
I'm Helene.

44:56.250 --> 44:57.333
Helene Albers.

45:11.625 --> 45:12.666
Katharina.

45:15.083 --> 45:17.041
That's a very beautiful name.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.958
St. Christopher!

45:29.375 --> 45:31.000
A nice thought.

45:32.333 --> 45:35.041
Someone carrying us on our journey.

45:37.750 --> 45:39.833
Someone watching over us.

45:45.750 --> 45:46.750
Come on now.

47:00.333 --> 47:01.333
Hello, Dad.

47:10.916 --> 47:11.916
Where's Mom?

47:20.083 --> 47:22.583
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

47:29.125 --> 47:30.500
It does what it wants.

47:42.958 --> 47:43.791
Come on.

47:45.333 --> 47:46.166
Leave him.

48:02.125 --> 48:04.583
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

48:08.291 --> 48:10.833
BUILDING PERMIT

48:55.458 --> 48:57.041
You promised me something.

49:01.708 --> 49:03.708
I kept my end of the agreement.

49:05.333 --> 49:06.958
Now you have to keep yours.

49:16.166 --> 49:18.708
You want to know where the origin is.

49:18.791 --> 49:20.458
And how to destroy it.

49:26.416 --> 49:27.416
You will.

49:32.083 --> 49:35.041
It took me over 66 years

49:36.208 --> 49:39.333
to finally understand
how everything is connected.

49:50.958 --> 49:52.166
You're right.

49:52.958 --> 49:55.583
It's time you understood, too.

50:41.166 --> 50:42.166
At school...

50:46.250 --> 50:48.375
when you came through the door, I...

50:49.875 --> 50:51.125
I had this feeling.

50:55.125 --> 50:56.625
As if we knew each other.

51:04.333 --> 51:05.416
From a dream.

51:07.000 --> 51:07.875
Or...

51:09.541 --> 51:10.791
I'm sorry.

51:12.291 --> 51:13.291
About it all.

51:28.541 --> 51:29.958
Where you're from...

51:33.750 --> 51:35.208
What was I like there?

51:40.083 --> 51:41.333
Was I different?

53:17.791 --> 53:22.500
I AM LEFT TO DIE ALONE,
AND I AM MY SOLE JUDGE. ME.

53:32.166 --> 53:37.583
THE BEGINNING IS THE END.
AND THE END IS THE BEGINNING.

57:28.041 --> 57:29.291
Why are we here?

57:32.791 --> 57:33.750
Because this...

57:34.416 --> 57:36.875
is where everything began.

57:38.958 --> 57:40.208
In your world.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.333
What does that mean?

57:54.125 --> 57:55.708
Your older self.

57:55.791 --> 57:58.208
She sent you and Jonas back

57:58.833 --> 58:00.666
for a single purpose.

58:13.208 --> 58:16.000
You were never meant
to stop the apocalypse.

58:18.208 --> 58:21.416
You were to create the origin.

58:37.083 --> 58:39.333
This is the origin.

58:42.625 --> 58:44.291
What's growing inside you

58:44.708 --> 58:46.708
is the bridge between both worlds.

58:46.791 --> 58:47.791
It can't be.

58:49.125 --> 58:52.375
It is the beginning of the knot

58:52.458 --> 58:54.625
and it will be its end.

58:58.958 --> 59:00.208
Your son.

59:02.583 --> 59:04.500
He is the origin.
