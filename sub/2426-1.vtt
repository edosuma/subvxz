WEBVTT

00:45.920 --> 00:47.380
He's a showstopper!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.340
- I love you.
- You special.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.940
Let's represent ourselves, now!
Are we done, Mr. Byrd?

00:52.040 --> 00:54.660
- I'm afraid not, Mr. Brown.
- Get on up here, Mr. Dynamite.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.660
- I'll take you to the money.
- Are we together, or we ain't?

00:57.760 --> 00:59.020
You're so pretty.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.860
Everybody gonna know your name.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.260
- I'm James Brown.
- You're so beautiful.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.781
- James Brown don't need nothing.
- What happened to you?

01:06.360 --> 01:08.900
James Brown don't need no one.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.380
Which brings us on to dental insurance.
Generally speaking...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.745
I'm back!

01:23.160 --> 01:24.700
I'm back!

01:26.200 --> 01:28.867
Get up off of that thing and
dance till you feel better

01:29.000 --> 01:32.380
Get up off of that thing and
dance till you, sing it now!

01:32.480 --> 01:33.860
Get up off of that thing

01:33.960 --> 01:35.180
The law deems it illegal...

01:35.280 --> 01:37.100
And dance till you feel better

01:37.200 --> 01:40.504
Get up off of that thing and
try to release that pressure

01:41.120 --> 01:44.620
Get up off of that thing and
shake till you feel better

01:44.720 --> 01:47.940
But, listen, in my three and a half
years experience in this business...

01:49.200 --> 01:50.661
Get up off!

01:53.000 --> 01:54.301
Good God!

01:54.760 --> 01:57.340
We want to get as many
people on to this...

01:58.560 --> 01:59.780
Everybody ready?

01:59.880 --> 02:02.069
We want to get as many
people on to this...

02:03.040 --> 02:04.341
Follow me!

02:11.080 --> 02:13.303
Want to get that? Good.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.820
All right. So, now, understand that

02:15.920 --> 02:18.300
not everyone has the same kind of needs.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.740
Get up off of that thing...

02:19.840 --> 02:21.141
Mavis.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.111
Mavis!

02:24.320 --> 02:26.500
Mr. Brown, you scared me.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.870
Get up off of that thing and
shake till you feel better

02:30.280 --> 02:31.900
Get up off of that thing

02:32.000 --> 02:33.180
Who in there, Mavis?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.580
I don't know.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.541
If there's anything I want you to take
away from this weekend, let it be this.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.300
They know I own this building.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.909
Ain't got no kind of
business using my bathroom.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.980
Some people may want a high deductible

03:02.080 --> 03:03.820
because they have much more to cover.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.180
But most common folk simply
want the lowest possible plan.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.460
So remember...

03:09.560 --> 03:11.100
Holy shit.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.140
Sit down. Sit down, ma'am.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.541
Sit!

03:17.160 --> 03:18.500
Being a Sunday and all,

03:18.600 --> 03:22.222
I want each and every one of you to
imagine you sitting in church right now.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.660
Now, today's sermon may be good,
but there's something else on your mind.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.111
You realize

03:30.960 --> 03:32.466
you got to take a shit.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.700
Real bad.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.220
And you don't wanna do
it in a church house.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.660
No, sir. So you just sit there.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.700
You think about getting home

03:41.800 --> 03:45.183
to your own toilet and
your own master bath.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.180
What was I talking about?

03:56.280 --> 03:57.500
Oh, yeah.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.311
You got to take a shit.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.060
Now, imagine unhitching your pants.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.304
As you open the door to your
master bath and you see me,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.220
James Brown,

04:08.320 --> 04:11.305
just sitting there, taking a break.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.141
What would you do?

04:15.280 --> 04:16.579
I said, what would you...

04:18.399 --> 04:20.384
Good God.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.100
Tear up the devil.
Gonna have to get that fixed.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.664
Now, I'm a busy man.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.780
And I'm guessing you cats are, too.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.343
But a personal convenience
has been abused here.

04:36.680 --> 04:40.580
Which one of you gentlefolk hung
a number two in my commode?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.420
Was it you, sir?

04:42.520 --> 04:44.060
- Was it you?
- Don't shoot.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.825
I ain't gonna shoot nobody, son!

04:51.800 --> 04:53.460
It was you, wasn't it?

04:53.560 --> 04:54.540
Oh, God.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.220
You took a break in
my bathroom, didn't you?

04:57.320 --> 04:58.860
Yes, you did.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.220
Oh. Now, now, now.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.860
It's gonna be okay.
Gonna be okay.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.260
What's your name?

05:08.360 --> 05:09.860
Shirley Buell.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.183
Shirley Buell. Get on up.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.340
Up.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.742
Sit down. Take your seat.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.025
Shirley Buell,
you had to use the toilet.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.220
You saw an opportunity, and you took it.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.224
I might have got mad,

05:28.440 --> 05:30.708
but you did right by yourself.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.307
I always did right by myself.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.140
I'm James Brown,

05:37.240 --> 05:38.541
and I made a difference.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.342
Y'all cats might not own my records.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.820
But you can bet your bottom dollar,

05:45.920 --> 05:48.540
every record you got,
got a piece of me in them.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.060
Ain't nobody out here today, rapping,
singing, whatever they doing,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.747
ain't been touched by James Brown.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.061
So, Miss Buell,

05:58.600 --> 06:00.902
you did right by yourself.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.263
There ain't no other way to live.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.860
You understand me?

06:04.960 --> 06:06.546
Yes, sir.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.583
Oh, shit, Shirley Buell.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.945
I got to go.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.900
Soul Brother Number 1 , James Brown,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.380
the Hardest Working
Man In Show Business,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.980
is embarking on a tour
with a difference.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.020
In association with the USO,

06:26.120 --> 06:28.580
Mr. Brown is performing
a series of shows

06:28.680 --> 06:32.268
for battle-fatigued US
troops across Vietnam.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.060
80% of Ninth Division is brothers.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.060
We been here two years.
What do we get as thanks?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.580
Country music.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.900
Country and...

06:41.000 --> 06:43.060
President Johnson.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.980
I wanna put a bug in your ear.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.905
I wanna go to Vietnam.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.500
I wanna show unity to
the fellas over there,

06:49.600 --> 06:51.980
the beleaguered,
the tired, in the dark.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.620
We got to show awareness.

06:53.720 --> 06:59.470
Mr. President, we got to bring the super
heavy funk to the cats over there.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.665
Captain Jenkins, the James
Brown Orchestra is a 22-piece.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.140
The government, army, powers that be,

07:11.240 --> 07:13.065
say I can only bring six fellas.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.260
What song did he say
we were starting with?

07:15.360 --> 07:16.780
Can't Stand it.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.940
- What?
- Can't Stand it.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.260
You hear that, Mr. Drummer?

07:21.760 --> 07:24.260
What was that?
Are they shooting at us?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.740
Please, Jesus! Please!

07:26.840 --> 07:28.266
Oh, my God.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.380
I ought to be able to bring
as many cats as I want.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.260
We're under attack, Mr. Brown!

07:35.360 --> 07:37.460
Settle down, Captain.
You with me.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.620
James Brown was born dead.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.500
Then I breathed.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.300
God didn't take me then. Sure ain't
gonna call me back right now.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.988
Marva, fellas,

07:54.240 --> 07:55.300
we under attack now.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.620
No shit, Mr. Brown.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.705
Watch that mouth, Maceo.
That's $20 right there.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.621
Mr. Byrd!

08:02.800 --> 08:04.101
Yes, sir, Mr. Brown.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.471
So we gonna begin tonight's
show with I Got The Feelin'.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.060
Well, James started out in Augusta,

08:10.160 --> 08:12.460
and then his family moved to Toccoa.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.660
And that's where we met.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.540
Sound good, Mr. Byrd?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.660
That sound good, Mr. Brown.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.391
Captain Jenkins,
you better put this out!

08:26.080 --> 08:28.542
Great day in the morning!

08:31.920 --> 08:34.179
James Brown!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.500
We're going down!

08:35.600 --> 08:37.549
Everybody brace!

08:51.600 --> 08:53.700
Welcome to Bear Cat, Mr. Brown.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.900
Officer Dooley, USO Liaison.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.340
Can I just say,
I'm a big, big fan of your...

08:57.440 --> 08:58.980
You in charge when Bob
Hope was over, Corporal?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.020
I was.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.940
Mr. Byrd, you think Bob
Hope's plane got shot down?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.100
No, sir, Mr. Brown.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.260
Sorry about the plane trouble.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.500
"Plane trouble"? They tried
to kill James Brown today.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.340
You wanna go down in history as
the man who killed the funk?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.900
About the show, if you could just
keep it to 25, 30 minutes, tops...

09:13.000 --> 09:14.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.820
Let me tell you the first
thing about James Brown.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.820
The first thing about James Brown is

09:17.920 --> 09:19.740
James Brown don't tell
no man his business.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.260
He ain't gonna tell you
how to take Pnom Ridge.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.660
He ain't gonna tell you how you
screwed up the Tet Offensive.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.020
I ain't gonna tell you how
to fight your war, Corporal.

09:27.120 --> 09:31.380
So don't tell me when, where,
or for how long I can be funky.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.782
James Brown!

09:34.960 --> 09:36.900
Sorry we're late.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.189
We had a little plane trouble.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.260
You cats ready?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.950
You cats ready?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.621
Hit it, Clyde!

09:52.760 --> 09:54.266
Mama?

09:57.760 --> 09:59.141
Mama?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.665
Mama.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.465
Mom!

10:06.480 --> 10:08.540
I got you. You ain't catch me.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.940
I'm gonna get ya.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.266
Come on.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.504
I won.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.625
Mama, I'm hungry.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.263
You ain't hungry, baby.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.785
You ain't hungry.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.900
That feeling inside your tummy,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.660
that feeling is a spirit inside you.

10:40.760 --> 10:44.980
He in there, tickling you, right now

10:45.080 --> 10:47.508
because you such a good boy.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.105
You ain't hungry.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.420
He in there right now,
trying to make you laugh.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.500
- You a good boy?
- I'm a good boy.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.390
- You a good boy?
- I'm a good boy.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.790
I'm a good boy!

11:12.400 --> 11:13.906
Where you been?

11:14.680 --> 11:17.060
I've been here for nine days
with your child. Where you been?

11:17.160 --> 11:20.270
I've been working turpentine,
baby, been chipping trees.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.860
- And gambling.
- What is this?

11:22.960 --> 11:24.140
Where the money at?
Where the money at?

11:24.240 --> 11:26.020
- What, you think I'm lying?
- You lying!

11:26.120 --> 11:27.300
I ain't lying!

11:27.400 --> 11:28.820
I should have never married you.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.300
Come here. Come here.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.380
Hey, you listen to me.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.748
What I need you to do...
What I need you to do, Susie...

11:34.560 --> 11:36.140
Listen, Susie.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.140
I need you to shut your sweet mouth

11:38.240 --> 11:40.820
and I need you to get
them panties off! Huh?

11:40.920 --> 11:42.220
Come here.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.667
Come here.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.545
I said come here!

11:47.120 --> 11:48.467
Hey!

11:58.400 --> 11:59.660
The money.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.340
And tell me about James' first band,
the Famous Flames.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.340
Well, it started off with five of us.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.340
Sylvester Keels, Baby Roy Scott,
and Nafloyd Scott.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.787
And then they left?

12:18.600 --> 12:21.500
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

12:21.600 --> 12:23.868
Cry if I want to...

12:24.440 --> 12:25.740
I need to speak with James.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.940
He's resting, Pop.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.308
Gertrude, it's important.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.740
Well, if you insist.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.380
Here we go.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.942
Mr. Brown will see you now, Mr. Bart.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.100
- Gertrude.
- Yes, Mr. Brown.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.900
Didn't I say I didn't
wanna be disturbed?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.109
It's gonna cost you $20.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.900
This better be real, Gertie.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.223
Oh, it's real, Mr. Brown.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.620
James, I just spoke with the producers.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.700
They want the Rolling Stones
to close the show.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.020
Rolling Stones, James.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.780
It will be you, then Rolling
Stones at the top of the bill.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.784
Rolling Stones, huh?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.820
Then why in the world we here, Bobby?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.020
We came to play, James.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.020
You're here because they
want you here, James.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.180
You're James Brown.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.500
I want you here because
this ain't the chitlin' circuit.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.947
We're done with that shit.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.700
We got an audience full
of white faces out there.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.700
You're gonna make them love you,
you're gonna slay them!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.780
You're just not closing the show.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.540
Rolling Stones, huh?

13:24.640 --> 13:28.300
James, James, don't start, please.
I mean, let it go.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.748
This don't matter, James.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.540
Rolling Stones.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.540
We got to go, Gertie.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.340
Rolling Stones ain't even
ever had a hit record here.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.780
Matter of fact,

13:40.880 --> 13:42.820
they ain't even ever played
in America, have they?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.460
Who cares? They're just kids.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.420
In a year, nobody's gonna
know who they are.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.740
They're instant has-beens.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.980
Rolling Stones?

13:49.080 --> 13:51.300
It's just business, James.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.300
When I hit that stage,

13:53.400 --> 13:55.304
you people better be ready.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.740
Especially the white folk.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.860
Yes, sir, Mr. Brown.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.500
And border-to-border...

14:01.600 --> 14:02.980
But where are The Flames?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.382
The Flames are right here, tonight.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.460
James Brown and his Famous Flames!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.268
Got your high-heeled sneakers on

14:29.800 --> 14:31.750
And your slip-in mules

14:32.280 --> 14:34.867
You got your high-heeled sneakers on

14:36.000 --> 14:37.825
And your slip-in mules

14:39.280 --> 14:40.911
All right

14:41.640 --> 14:43.226
You know you're out of sight

14:44.960 --> 14:47.103
You got a shapely figure, mama

14:48.480 --> 14:50.430
Keep it uptight

14:51.400 --> 14:53.509
You got a shapely figure, mama

14:54.600 --> 14:56.629
Keep me uptight

14:58.160 --> 14:59.825
You're too much

15:00.560 --> 15:02.624
You know you're out of sight

15:09.440 --> 15:13.028
You got a sweet disposition

15:13.720 --> 15:15.863
You're always right

15:16.960 --> 15:19.308
You got a sweet disposition

15:20.120 --> 15:22.149
You know you're always right

15:23.440 --> 15:25.947
My heart delights at what you are

15:26.360 --> 15:28.150
You know you're out of sight

15:31.880 --> 15:33.545
You're too much

15:35.200 --> 15:36.865
You're the end, now

15:38.400 --> 15:40.145
You're beautiful, mama

15:40.440 --> 15:42.390
Most of all, you're out of sight

15:43.720 --> 15:46.830
There's no doubt, you're out of sight

15:47.400 --> 15:49.190
Out of sight

16:17.320 --> 16:19.190
Welcome to America.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.980
Here they are, those fine
fellows from England,

16:25.080 --> 16:27.180
the Rolling Stones!

16:28.400 --> 16:33.069
Time is on my side
Yes, it is

16:33.280 --> 16:35.820
See, I can't never quit
when it get hard.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.540
You quit, you're going backwards.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.180
You're going backwards, you're dead.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.660
No, I take it.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.140
And I take it, and I flip it.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.980
I goes forward.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.906

17:17.400 --> 17:19.220

17:19.319 --> 17:21.140
And I don't need no hungry child!

17:21.240 --> 17:23.660
You keep him and feed him. I can't.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.099
Bye, baby.
You be a good boy.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.339
Yeah, that's right.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.060

17:47.960 --> 17:49.307

17:50.360 --> 17:51.460

18:18.080 --> 18:20.189
Get up in that house now!

19:40.560 --> 19:41.660
You didn't hear me?

19:41.760 --> 19:43.585

19:44.960 --> 19:48.180

You've got some groovy moves, my friend.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.620
Thank you, Mr. Avalon.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.749
Please call me Mr. Brown.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.024
Mr. Brown. Yeah.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.349
James, what are you doing?
Get up.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.180
- How many times have I done this split?
- A thousand, maybe two thousand.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.660
Exactly. Now the first and
only time I rip my pants

22:42.760 --> 22:45.666
got to be in front of
all these white folk.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.664
In a white boy sweater.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.425
My bass and my drums spread
all over this cold floor.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.546
Go get me a towel.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.425

23:03.440 --> 23:06.630
Boy, pack up. We leaving.

We gonna fix that.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.540

23:42.640 --> 23:43.941
Yes, sir.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.380
Fannie Lou, you need to
stomp out that cigarette

23:46.480 --> 23:47.980

23:48.080 --> 23:49.380
And I mean change them.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.580
Don't just flip them over.
These men ain't stupid.

Lucille, come wash this dog.
He getting gamey.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.346
Aunt Honey?

24:02.200 --> 24:05.020
Now, Joe, you ain't say
nothing about no donkey.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.821
What the hell am I
supposed to do with that?

24:08.880 --> 24:12.150
Oh, I thought you could sell it.
And it's a mule.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.060
I don't see a mule or
a donkey here, Joe.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.020
It's much appreciated, Honey.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.501
This is mighty kind of you.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.827
Jumping in the army ain't gonna
make this child go away.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.625
Listen, boy.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.149
You look after yourself.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.824

24:50.080 --> 24:51.300

The more you give,

27:19.080 --> 27:20.980

27:21.080 --> 27:22.984
If you don't love him like I love him.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.140
The more you're blessed.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.980
You just gotta have faith!

27:28.080 --> 27:32.351
Have faith the size of a mustard
seed and you can move a mountain!

27:32.520 --> 27:34.549
Faith that moves his hands!

27:34.720 --> 27:37.300
Can ya hear me? Can ya hear me?

27:37.400 --> 27:40.300
The more you give,

27:40.400 --> 27:41.620
Move your feet!

27:41.720 --> 27:43.660
Move your feet and let

27:49.080 --> 27:51.906

27:54.440 --> 27:56.185

27:56.600 --> 27:59.107
Give him the glory!

28:04.320 --> 28:07.385
Say it loud for Jesus.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.750
Louder! Louder! Louder!

Hey!

28:36.600 --> 28:37.540

28:51.480 --> 28:53.980
You know what that mean, Big Junior?

28:54.080 --> 28:58.740
Mean they can send my juvenile
behind down for a man's term.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.620
Three, maybe four years.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.704
For robbing a suit?

29:03.040 --> 29:04.990
What about Aunt Honey?

29:05.120 --> 29:07.420
Aunt Honey say she can't
help you right now.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.180
Not this week.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.105
Got money problems.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.461

29:15.360 --> 29:16.866
Sorry?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.781

29:20.200 --> 29:22.940
Big, don't leave me up in here, man!

29:23.040 --> 29:24.260
Big!

29:24.360 --> 29:26.389
Oh!

29:28.240 --> 29:29.420
Mary, don't you weep

29:29.520 --> 29:31.310
Tell Martha not to moan

29:31.440 --> 29:33.540
Martha, don't you moan

29:33.640 --> 29:34.980
Sweet little Mary

29:35.080 --> 29:36.300
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

29:36.400 --> 29:38.260
Tell Martha not to moan

29:38.360 --> 29:40.344

29:40.520 --> 29:43.580

- Pharaoh's army

29:43.680 --> 29:45.340
Don't you know that they drowned?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.300
Drowned in the Red Sea

29:47.400 --> 29:48.700
I'm singing, Mary

29:48.800 --> 29:50.620
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

29:50.720 --> 29:52.460
Tell Martha not to moan

29:52.560 --> 29:54.305
Martha, don't you moan

29:54.560 --> 29:56.020
Oh, Mary

29:56.120 --> 29:57.980
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

29:58.080 --> 29:59.580
Tell Martha not to moan

29:59.680 --> 30:02.020
Martha, don't you moan

30:02.120 --> 30:03.380
Mary

30:03.480 --> 30:05.987
You eyeballing me, Music Box?

30:06.320 --> 30:08.300
I say, you eyeballing me, Music Box?

30:17.320 --> 30:19.020
Stand on the rock

30:19.120 --> 30:21.548
Where Moses stood

30:27.160 --> 30:29.110
What happened to you?

30:29.480 --> 30:31.942
Somebody threw something.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.550
That's too bad.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.820
Walk in the jungle sometime

30:39.920 --> 30:41.420
you get bit by a snake.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.347
I'll remember that next time
I go walking in the jungle.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.700
Say, what's that song you done?

30:47.800 --> 30:49.980
We only done half of it.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.700
Mary Don't You Weep.
It's a old gospel, man.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.900
You ain't heard it before?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.189
Everybody be doing it.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.705
I ain't heard a thing since
my radio got busted.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.860
Sweet song, though.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.422
- Yeah.
- You made it sound hip.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.260
The crowd sure enough
went crazy, didn't they?

31:09.920 --> 31:12.222
You do music?

31:13.040 --> 31:15.911
The only thing keep me sane in here.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.469
How long you in here for?

31:20.080 --> 31:22.428
Five to 13 years.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.911
Oh, what'd you do?

31:29.160 --> 31:30.985
Rob a suit.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.980
You got five to 13 for robbing a suit?

31:35.080 --> 31:36.541
Next.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.860
That's some time, man.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.060
Tell me about it.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.860
You get parole?

31:45.280 --> 31:50.586
The Board say I got to have a
permanent family address and a job.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.700
See, I don't know no folks around here.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.700
Where your folks at?

31:54.800 --> 31:56.670
My daddy in the army.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.585
My mama,

31:59.120 --> 32:00.546
she left.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.941
I'm sorry to hear that.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.551
Seriously,

32:12.440 --> 32:14.390
you think I sung that good?

32:15.200 --> 32:16.865
Yeah, man.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.469
You got that swing feel.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.821
Hitting it late.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.500
That's what a song need.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.660
You got to fill it with something.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.180
It don't got that feel,

32:29.280 --> 32:31.662
it don't move, it don't move,
it don't move nobody.

32:35.880 --> 32:40.185
If I could

32:40.560 --> 32:45.060
I surely would

32:45.160 --> 32:48.940
Stand on the rock

32:49.040 --> 32:52.787
Where Moses stood

32:53.440 --> 32:57.267
- Pharaoh's army
- Pharaoh's army

33:00.680 --> 33:02.300
The Red Sea

33:02.400 --> 33:04.900
I'm singing, Mary

33:05.000 --> 33:06.426
Mary

33:06.920 --> 33:13.751
Martha, don't you moan
Martha, don't you moan

33:15.440 --> 33:18.860
Bobby, we got us enough mouths to
feed and enough butts to clothe.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.700
Daryl! Sarah!
Get down here!

33:20.800 --> 33:22.820
Mama, he could spend 10 years in there,

33:22.920 --> 33:25.020
just because he ain't got no folks.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.820
He ain't got nobody.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.500
Bobby, the answer is no.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.823
Now, go on upstairs and get cleaned up.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.348
What's that thing you've been
telling me since I was little?

33:39.840 --> 33:41.744
About mercy.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.180
What's your saying, Mama?

33:44.280 --> 33:46.582
That thing you always say?

33:49.960 --> 33:53.860
Like I always say, it's a sin
to stand in mercy's way.

33:53.960 --> 33:54.980
Thank you, Mrs. Byrd.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.427
You're welcome.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.780
So, what you in the pokey for?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.100
Grandpa.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.581
You know how Big Mama would have felt,
you bringing this boy over here.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.940
Big Mama married you.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.500
And you was in the
pokey before, Grandpa.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.179
- Bobby Byrd.
- Mama...

34:11.280 --> 34:13.540
If I'm going to be forced to
have a jailbird in my house,

34:13.639 --> 34:15.179
I at least like to know
what I'm dealing with.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.105
- Grandpa.
- No.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.621
He got a right to ask.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.550
I robbed a man's
three-piece suit.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.739
You want to know me?
I'll tell you.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.790
I'm skinny, but I'm strong.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.071
I can read a little bit
and I like to sing.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.139
You know what I think,

34:37.239 --> 34:41.101
God knew when I took that suit I
was gonna end up here with y'all.

34:43.159 --> 34:46.623
Now I ain't never been at a table with
such a fine group of folk in my life.

34:47.520 --> 34:52.145
And a meal with fried chicken,
green beans, cornbread.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.141
Nice curtains.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.783
House that smells good.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.460
Tell you the truth,
I'm glad I took that suit.

35:00.680 --> 35:04.420
Boy. Pass them beans before you
get your bullshit all over them.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.821
Grandpa.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.060
James is gonna sing with us
at church this Sunday, Sarah.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.461
Really?

35:11.920 --> 35:16.191
Maybe me and you could,
work on a little harmony together.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.540
Nafloyd, you always fall
flat on that second verse.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.140
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Hey, Bobby.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.260
Make y'all selves at home.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.460
There's coffee in the kitchen.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.820
Ma!

35:29.920 --> 35:31.506
James!

35:32.200 --> 35:34.548
James! Come meet the band!

35:38.840 --> 35:40.505
Sarah.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.901
Sarah!

35:46.720 --> 35:49.140
I ain't telling you again.
Get down here.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.460
Ma, she coming.
Mama, she coming.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.024
Can you go and fix the boys something
to eat before we go to church?

35:56.440 --> 35:59.061
Steal away home

35:59.280 --> 36:01.460
Steal away to Jesus

36:01.560 --> 36:03.140
I'm gonna steal away to Jesus

36:03.240 --> 36:05.820
Steal away home

36:05.920 --> 36:08.746
I ain't got long to stay here

36:09.000 --> 36:11.820
- The trumpet sounds within my
- Sounds

36:11.920 --> 36:14.382
- Soul, soul
- Soul, soul

36:14.920 --> 36:16.860
I ain't got long to stay here

36:16.960 --> 36:18.260
No time to waste

36:18.360 --> 36:20.340
I ain't got long to stay here

36:20.440 --> 36:21.660
No time for mistakes

36:21.760 --> 36:23.260
I ain't got long to stay here

36:23.360 --> 36:24.820
That's why I'm gonna steal away

36:24.920 --> 36:27.188
Steal away to Jesus

36:33.960 --> 36:35.910
This ought to fit you.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.700
Ooh, I don't know, James.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.620
This don't look like gospel.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.700
What you talking about, Bobby?

36:46.800 --> 36:51.469
Where I'm standing,
your hair is rising up to the Lord.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.991
Rising up to the Lord like a flame.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.900
The flames of hell.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.460
We're The Gospel Starlighters.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.625
We're a gospel group.
This is R&B hair.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.944
Nafloyd, what you think you're
doing when you sing Caldonia?

37:06.160 --> 37:09.380
We just playing around
when we practicing Caldonia.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.100
That don't make us R&B.
We still gospel.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.420
Good Lord, James.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.060
How long I got to keep this in?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.660
I feel like a flame already.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.780
A-wop-bop a-loo-bop
A wop bam boom

37:20.000 --> 37:22.740
Tutti frutti, aw rooty
Tutti frutti

37:22.840 --> 37:28.580
Ooh, tutti frutti, aw rooty
Tutti frutti, aw rooty

37:28.680 --> 37:31.380
Tutti frutti, aw rooty

37:31.480 --> 37:34.420
A-wop-bop a-loo-bop
A wop bam boom

37:34.520 --> 37:39.144
I got a girl named Sue
She knows just what to do

37:39.680 --> 37:44.429
I got a girl named Sue
She knows just what to do

37:44.680 --> 37:47.420
She rocks to the east
She rocks to the west

37:47.520 --> 37:49.900
But she's the girl that I love best

37:50.000 --> 37:54.066
Tutti frutti, aw rooty
Tutti frutti

37:54.200 --> 38:00.064
Ooh, tutti frutti, aw rooty
Tutti frutti, aw rooty

38:00.200 --> 38:02.820
Tutti frutti, aw rooty

38:02.920 --> 38:04.860
A-wop-bop a-loo-bop

38:04.960 --> 38:06.705
Yeah!

38:16.040 --> 38:20.743
Tutti frutti, aw rooty
Tutti frutti, aw rooty

38:21.520 --> 38:24.060
A-wop-bop a-loo-bop
A wop bam boom

38:33.960 --> 38:36.380
Look at these people, James.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.220
I'm ready.
You know what I mean?

38:38.320 --> 38:39.985
When is it gonna be when we're up there?

38:40.200 --> 38:42.500
We'll be back in 10 to flip you again!

38:42.600 --> 38:45.028
Whoo! Yeah!

38:45.320 --> 38:46.780
Right now.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.300
What?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.900
There's a stage and a piano and
right now ain't nobody on it.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.780
What you talking about?
We can't go up there.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.300
Why not, Nafloyd?

38:55.400 --> 38:59.466
It's like you said, "We just
playing around with Caldonia. "

39:00.480 --> 39:02.270
Let's go play around.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.185
- We on.
- Let's go.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.620
Ladies...

39:13.720 --> 39:16.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
hope you're enjoying the show.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.220
We're The Starlighters...

39:17.320 --> 39:18.300
We're the Famous Flames!

39:18.400 --> 39:19.660
Famous?

39:19.760 --> 39:20.740
Flames?

39:20.840 --> 39:23.427
We're the Famous Flames.

39:25.080 --> 39:28.500
Caldonia!
Caldonia!

39:28.600 --> 39:31.585
What makes your big head so hard?

39:31.960 --> 39:35.020
Walkin' with my baby
She's got great big feet

39:35.120 --> 39:37.860
She's long, lean, and lanky
Ain't got nothing to eat

39:37.960 --> 39:42.709
But she's my baby
and I love her just the same

39:44.120 --> 39:49.267
Crazy 'bout that woman
Because Caldonia is her name

39:50.640 --> 39:53.260
Caldonia, Caldonia

39:53.360 --> 39:56.584
What makes your big head so hard?

39:58.360 --> 40:01.380
Know what? Mama told me
to leave Caldonia alone

40:01.480 --> 40:02.580
Say something's wrong with her

40:02.680 --> 40:04.060
She said,
"Son Keep away from that woman"

40:04.160 --> 40:05.825
Your momma don't know

40:06.040 --> 40:08.820
But Mama didn't know
What Caldonia was putting down

40:29.440 --> 40:31.469
Oh, yeah

40:32.000 --> 40:35.340
Caldonia, Caldonia

40:35.440 --> 40:37.947
What makes your big head so hard?

40:39.480 --> 40:40.740
We the Flames!

40:48.040 --> 40:50.422
We're just keeping it warm for you.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.470
What's your name?

40:52.800 --> 40:56.149
- We're the Famous Flames.
- No. What's your name?

40:58.680 --> 41:01.460
I play a show in Lafayette last week.

41:02.480 --> 41:06.100
Twenty, 30 girls pass clean out.
Need oxygen, James.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.780
I'm killing them!
They should lock me away!

41:08.880 --> 41:11.340
I cut loose and it's
like a spaceship land.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.220
Did I say I got a record out?

41:14.760 --> 41:19.140
They drop it five times a day on WIBB.

41:19.240 --> 41:22.703
Five times a day.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.506
And I'm flipping burgers.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.381
You know why?

41:30.160 --> 41:34.260
Because WIBB antenna reach 60 mile.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.740
Sixty mile, James!

41:36.840 --> 41:39.900
This country is 5,000 miles top-to-toe!

41:40.000 --> 41:42.507
7,000 coast-to-coast.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.665
You catch the wind,

41:45.320 --> 41:46.780
get a hit,

41:46.880 --> 41:49.420
a real hit!

41:50.600 --> 41:52.823
Every inch of that is yours.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.066
How you catch the wind?

41:59.120 --> 42:01.220
- Dottie! Dottie!
- Yeah.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.220
May I borrow your pencil?

42:03.320 --> 42:04.380
You got a hundred bucks?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.350
- No, man.
- Rob a liquor store.

42:06.760 --> 42:10.580
You take a hundred bucks
down to WIBB in Macon.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.260
Ask for Big Sauk.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.660
Say Richard sent you.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.260
You make an acetate.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.380
Ten copies.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.989
You send them to these people.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.420
- It's that easy, why don't you do it?
- Already did.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.860
Baby, this the last time you gonna
see my beautiful ass except on TV.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.020
Six months, the whole
world gonna know me.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.580
I gonna be bigger than Cleopatra!

42:33.680 --> 42:36.904
It's written in the stars,
James. Yes, sir.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.629
I'm gonna have the world on a string.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.388
And that when the trouble start.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.350
And why is that?

42:47.840 --> 42:50.302
That when the Devil come out.

42:51.160 --> 42:56.307
And he ain't gonna be red
with no fiery tail. No.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.060
He gonna be white.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.300
In a fancy suit.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.900
And he gonna look you in your eye

43:03.000 --> 43:05.462
and ask you, "What you want?"

43:05.760 --> 43:08.420
And you best not shake, nor tremble.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.868
You best not blink one eye.

43:13.200 --> 43:16.185
You gonna be ready for him, James?

43:21.240 --> 43:23.190
You got it inside?

43:25.240 --> 43:27.224
You tell me, Richard.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.989
Tell me what you see.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.420
What happened to you?

43:46.360 --> 43:49.140
I know what happened to me, sugar.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.540
What happened to you?

44:06.400 --> 44:08.620
And now, folks,

44:08.720 --> 44:12.700
the Augusta Country Club
is proud to present to y'all

44:12.800 --> 44:17.460
its Annual Charity Extravaganza!

44:17.560 --> 44:20.180
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:20.280 --> 44:23.300
The Battle Royale!

44:38.760 --> 44:40.221
Fight!

44:58.360 --> 45:00.105
Number 2, get up, get up!

46:56.440 --> 46:59.391
What exactly do you call
your style of music?

46:59.600 --> 47:01.420
I call it James Brown Music,

47:01.520 --> 47:03.980
because it's so far ahead of its time.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.541
They ain't got a name for it yet.

47:05.880 --> 47:09.020
Take another record, any record
you got on your box at home.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.860
It ain't gonna sound like mine.

47:10.960 --> 47:13.940
Not even my own old records
sound like this new bag.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.860
It's like the title say,

47:15.960 --> 47:18.180
Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.460
The funk is in the bag
and the bag is the bass

47:20.560 --> 47:22.180
and the bass never change.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.940
It's a groove.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.860
Soon as you hear that groove,

47:25.960 --> 47:27.910
I know I got ya.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.500
Honey, please

47:34.920 --> 47:36.745
I love you so

47:36.920 --> 47:39.382
Please, please don't go

47:43.760 --> 47:45.744
One more time

47:46.440 --> 47:49.425
Please, please don't go

47:51.800 --> 47:54.501
Please, please don't go

47:56.960 --> 47:59.786
Please, please don't go

48:05.960 --> 48:07.900
Now that was a night.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.428
We sure did kill them, James.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.500
Bobby.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.660
Yeah?

48:15.760 --> 48:18.631
I can't make practice on Thursday,
I'm getting married.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.827
What you talking about?
Who you marrying?

48:22.520 --> 48:25.220
Gal I met after the Stone Mountain show.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.420
Velma.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.349
And what about my sister?

48:31.040 --> 48:33.420
I'll still harmonize with
her from time to time.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.780
This ain't nothing to play with, James.

48:36.880 --> 48:38.940
How you gonna do all this?

48:39.040 --> 48:40.180
Do all what?

48:40.280 --> 48:44.700
Practice, the road, making records.
Starting a family.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.900
I ain't starting nothing.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.540
Except what we doing.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.306
Bobby,

48:54.040 --> 48:55.705
we in there.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.820
All them little grooves.

48:58.920 --> 48:59.940
That's us.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.780
That's all the money we got.

49:01.880 --> 49:03.100
And some we don't.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.502
Yeah, but it's been written.

49:06.400 --> 49:09.460
Now, men gonna lay
with women, that's nature.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.460
But a woman ain't gonna stop a man,

49:11.560 --> 49:14.830
a real man, from doing
what he's supposed to do.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.260
And woman is the glory of man,

49:18.360 --> 49:20.503
but we're the cover for them.

49:20.840 --> 49:22.505
That's God.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.980
Husband, daddy,
that just give us purpose.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.860
Man got to have purpose,
but purpose ain't gonna stop us neither.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.220
Ain't nothing gonna stop us

49:32.320 --> 49:34.460
from what's meant to be.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.021
Nothing.

49:37.160 --> 49:39.383
And that's God, too.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.900
Keep pushing the doggone car.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.860
Man, why don't we just take
a break for a second, man?

49:44.960 --> 49:47.980
- What'd I tell you in Peterstown?
- You said, "Fill her up, Floyd."

49:48.080 --> 49:49.140
That's right. That's what he said.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.460
But I ain't had the
dough to fill her up.

49:50.560 --> 49:53.220
Because Bobby over here done gave James
all the money on some fake records.

49:53.320 --> 49:54.340
Why don't you cool it, Floyd?

49:54.440 --> 49:55.660
I miss you.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.711
Talk to you later. All right, bye.

50:06.880 --> 50:10.660
Our next gig is at the Two Spot,
140 miles west.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.500
We got no gas. No bread.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.580
Am I missing anything?

50:14.680 --> 50:16.391
Velma pregnant.

50:17.400 --> 50:18.900
Congratulations.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.820
So, we gotta make us a business decision.
We got 30 cents.

50:21.920 --> 50:25.429
Question is, do I get a
coffee or do I get a donut?

50:27.760 --> 50:29.346
Knock yourself out.

50:32.720 --> 50:36.949
Hi, honey. Can I get a
coffee and a donut?

50:37.280 --> 50:38.780
You boys from out of town?

50:38.880 --> 50:41.148
Yeah. We musicians.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.664
We the Famous Flames.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.185
More like a flicker.

50:49.520 --> 50:52.940
Baby, all we need is a spark
to keep the lamp down low

50:53.040 --> 50:56.105
till the sun rise up
on us in the morning.

50:59.280 --> 51:02.504
Y'all's broke asses splitting
that donut, ain't you?

51:03.680 --> 51:05.982
Let me go cut it up for you.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.700
Excuse me, ma'am.

51:07.800 --> 51:09.909
I'm looking for some fellas.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.420
Been driving through two
states trying to find them.

51:12.520 --> 51:15.221
They were a no-show last
night at the Tuxedo Room.

51:16.960 --> 51:17.900
Get down.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.940
Have you ever heard
of the Famous Flames?

51:21.040 --> 51:23.860
I ain't supposed to leave Bibb County
without telling my parole officer.

51:23.960 --> 51:25.300
Shit, James. What are we gonna do?

51:25.400 --> 51:29.147
If you can help me out,
I'll make it worth your while.

51:29.960 --> 51:32.380
King Records?
What do you want with them?

51:32.480 --> 51:34.669
King Records?

51:36.560 --> 51:38.140
Excuse me, sir.

51:38.240 --> 51:41.140
I'm Bobby Byrd of the Famous Flames.

51:41.240 --> 51:44.589
I'm Ralph Bass from Federal
Records in Cincinnati.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.260
- Why don't we have a seat?
- Okay.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.580
I heard your acetate.

51:48.680 --> 51:50.540
I want you to come to Cincinnati.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.385
I want you to make a record for King.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.420
King as in King Records?

51:54.520 --> 51:56.185
As in the King Records?

51:56.600 --> 51:59.665
Yeah, you put a lot into that cut.
Those lead vocals.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.180
You got a lot of soul right there.

52:01.280 --> 52:04.026
Oh, that's not me,
that's him, James Brown.

52:04.280 --> 52:05.581
That's you singing?

52:06.240 --> 52:08.702
Yes, sir, that's me.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.260
Oh.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.780
Thank you.

52:14.920 --> 52:18.180
Please, please, please, please

52:19.880 --> 52:22.460
Please, please don't go

52:22.560 --> 52:25.540
Please, please, please

52:25.640 --> 52:27.180
What the hell is this, Ralph?

52:27.280 --> 52:28.866
Where is the rest of the song?

52:29.560 --> 52:30.980
Right there.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.380
Right there? What are you talking about?

52:32.480 --> 52:35.300
He keeps hollering the one word
over and over again! "Please!"

52:35.400 --> 52:38.780
Please, what? Please pay my rent?
What does he want?

52:38.880 --> 52:40.300
Listen, Mr. Nathan. This song is a...

52:40.400 --> 52:42.140
I don't hear any song here, Ralph!

52:42.240 --> 52:43.460
A song has verses.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.660
You know what I mean?
A song has a snappy chorus.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.461
It's not just some unfortunate
nigger just pleading like that!

52:53.360 --> 52:54.980
Where is the song?
Give me the song, Ralph!

52:55.080 --> 52:56.620
It's not about the song!

52:56.720 --> 52:57.780
What?

52:57.880 --> 53:00.262
It's not the song.

53:02.040 --> 53:04.940
You took my love, now you're gone

53:05.040 --> 53:07.580
Please, please don't go

53:07.680 --> 53:13.066
Please, please, please, please, please

53:13.320 --> 53:18.260
Please, please, please, please, please

53:18.360 --> 53:20.860
Please, please don't go

53:20.960 --> 53:24.582
Velma, you gonna smile for me?
There you go.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.266
Teddy Brown.

53:29.720 --> 53:31.900
I love you so!

53:32.000 --> 53:34.064
Please, please don't go

53:36.120 --> 53:39.549
Honey, please don't go

53:42.800 --> 53:45.102
I love you so!

53:50.360 --> 53:53.220
James, I'd like you to meet somebody.

53:53.320 --> 53:54.460
James, this is Ben Bart.

53:54.560 --> 53:57.020
Ben is the President
of Universal Attractions,

53:57.120 --> 53:58.460
New York's biggest booking agency.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.540
Hey, man.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.780
Great show last week over in Jersey!

54:01.880 --> 54:04.148
You blew the roof off the place!

54:04.480 --> 54:06.305
Thank you, sir.

54:06.840 --> 54:08.380
We try real hard to do our best.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.500
Not "we," James.
Not the Famous Flames.

54:11.600 --> 54:13.743
You, James Brown.

54:14.680 --> 54:18.069
- James, what Ben is trying to say...
- I know what Mr. Bart is saying.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.551
I heard him.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.064
Loud and clear.

54:25.760 --> 54:28.301
I see where this thing is going.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.260
Saw it this morning.

54:32.360 --> 54:36.028
Your secretary called,
asked me to come in an hour early.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.980
Alone.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.905
I knew it six months ago.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.822
Hell, I knew it the day I was born.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.902
Okay, fellas, I got
something to show you.

55:00.280 --> 55:04.266
I don't understand.
Is this some sort of... mistake?

55:05.080 --> 55:08.180
"James Brown and his Famous Flames"?

55:08.280 --> 55:10.940
Sir, this ain't right.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.220
We agree.

55:12.320 --> 55:15.191
I believe it should say simply,
"James Brown."

55:15.400 --> 55:16.620
The fact is, gentlemen,

55:16.720 --> 55:18.780
James Brown is a powerhouse talent

55:18.880 --> 55:21.023
who does not need the Famous Flames.

55:21.360 --> 55:24.700
King Records, Universal,
are big companies.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.068
We do not need the Famous Flames.

55:28.920 --> 55:32.980
But James has requested the name
remain in some form or another.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.701
So, you can stay

55:36.600 --> 55:40.260
as salaried employees of James Brown,

55:40.360 --> 55:42.822
working on James Brown's records.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.588
If this is disagreeable to you in
whole or in part, you can go home.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.061
James?

55:55.440 --> 55:58.823
Bobby, it's just a name.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.504
Ain't nothing different between us.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.503
This is for everybody.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.750
It's gonna be good.

56:14.120 --> 56:15.990
James Brown.

56:16.680 --> 56:18.823
I ain't never like you.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.060
Come on.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.110
Let's get out of here.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.110
You wrong, James.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.540
So,

56:46.640 --> 56:48.271
James,

56:48.840 --> 56:50.426
do you know what you want?

56:56.120 --> 56:58.100
I know exactly what I want.

56:58.200 --> 57:01.220
King doesn't do live albums.
They are too expensive. That's it.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.620
But Federal Records can.

57:02.720 --> 57:05.220
- See, Mr. Nathan, I think a live album...
- No, James, you listen to me.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.140
Your audience is Negro.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.860
Negroes don't buy albums.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.620
They don't have the resources.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.502
Especially not for a bunch of
songs which they already got!

57:14.680 --> 57:16.220
Look, it's just

57:16.320 --> 57:19.820
live recording is six, seven times
more expensive than in studio.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.380
And that's just for a
violin concerto at the Met.

57:22.480 --> 57:23.906
Pop, you seen the show.

57:24.320 --> 57:27.220
Mr. Nathan, you ain't even ever
seen the show. Not my show.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.826
I don't need to.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.740
Mr. Nathan, what the hell you doing?

57:33.840 --> 57:35.824
That's the "Mashed Potato."

57:36.040 --> 57:37.940
That ain't nobody's Mashed Potato.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.780
Exactly. I can't do
the Mashed Potato.

57:40.880 --> 57:44.024
That's your job. That's the show.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.580
What I know how to do is the business.

57:46.680 --> 57:48.311
I stick to what I know.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.380
You stick to what you know.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.300
That's the show business.

57:52.400 --> 57:53.940
Syd Nathan wrong.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.024
Book the Apollo.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.580
I'm gonna spend my own money on this.

58:00.760 --> 58:03.300
Forget it. It's too big a risk.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.180
Let's get something to eat.

58:05.280 --> 58:06.980
So I don't understand risk?

58:07.080 --> 58:08.381
No.

58:08.920 --> 58:12.110
I don't understand,
'cause I'm just a show.

58:12.680 --> 58:14.260
That's all I am to you, Pop?

58:14.360 --> 58:15.500
Of course not, James.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.140
Sure it is.

58:17.240 --> 58:20.180
That's all me and my black
brothers are to the white devil.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.300
We the show, and you the money.

58:22.400 --> 58:23.820
And that's how the white
devil keep it all.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.180
I'm just trying to protect you.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.866
And I'm not the white devil.

58:28.240 --> 58:29.951
And don't ever call me that again!

58:31.240 --> 58:33.588
Pop, look me in the eye.

58:34.360 --> 58:35.741
You believe in what we're doing here?

58:36.320 --> 58:37.780
100%, man. You know that.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.228
Then yeah, I am the show.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.820
But if I'm spending my
own money on the show,

58:42.920 --> 58:44.585
I'm gonna be the business, too.

58:45.440 --> 58:47.340
After we slay the Apollo,

58:47.440 --> 58:49.220
I kick over some cash
to the white devil,

58:49.320 --> 58:50.940
whatever I think he deserve.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.700
And, Pop, if I'm paying you,

58:53.800 --> 58:55.226
you gonna help me to do it.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.106
Oi.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.583
Okay. I'll call Nola Sound.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.220
They got these great new
three-track recorders from Ampex.

59:08.320 --> 59:11.420
And I want the best engineer in town.

59:11.520 --> 59:14.540
I don't care what it take.
I don't care what it cost.

59:14.640 --> 59:16.220
And I want everybody in uniform.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.987
The front of house,
the ushers, peanut peddlers.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.700
And I'm gonna be in
a sapphire blue suit.

59:21.800 --> 59:25.786
And I want the rest of the
fellas in purple brocade.

59:26.160 --> 59:27.700
Purple brocade.

59:27.800 --> 59:29.101
Underwear, too.

59:29.240 --> 59:30.905
How's that sound?

59:33.480 --> 59:37.307
James Brown!

59:42.320 --> 59:46.340
We've got the level on his main mic
way up to drown out the crowd!

59:46.440 --> 59:49.823
But he's got to hold back a little
bit during the first number!

59:57.680 --> 59:59.266
You ready, Mr. Byrd?

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.590
Yes, sir, Mr. Brown.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.060
James Brown!

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.591
I thought I lost someone

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.869
But I know where I'm gonna find them

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.900

We're gonna do it again tomorrow.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.140
Go on and take it.
I got other vices.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.460

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.340
Get you a glass, Bobby.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.220
James? Mr. Brown.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.021
Go on over there now.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.587
There's a woman here now
who say she your mama.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.943
It's right down there.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.185
We got pretty girls and sweet whiskey.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.020
Y'all got y'all's money?

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.660
We got our money right here.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.266
Mama?

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.021
Mama?

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.305
Mama.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.744
Mama, it's me.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.424
You know this little nigger?

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.465
Your mama's a
no-account fool, Little Junior.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.231
Daddy, too.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.065
But you ain't gonna be.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.461
You gonna be okay.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.828
It was determined before you were born.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.231
Little Junior, you were born dead.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.941
Did you know that?

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.740
When your great-aunt pulled you

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.427
into this world, you had gone cold.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.540
She slapped your behind hard,

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.066
but you wouldn't take air.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.500
Then she breathed in you one last time

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.824
and you got warm and you screamed.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.340
Screamed so loud we heard you all
the way over here in Augusta.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.749
You special, boy.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.342
You got the spirit in you.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.300
And that spirit told me

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.146
you gonna be a rich man, Little Junior.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.500
He spoke to me and said

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.302
one day, everybody
gonna know your name.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.781
And ain't nothing,
nothing can touch you.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.980
Look at that. You gonna love this place.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.060
Oh, I had a big breakfast.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.462
Look, Jimmy, I got
something to show you.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.110
You got something to show me?

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.820
Compliments of Universal Attractions.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.940
This for me?

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.782
Lookie here. Lookie here.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.340
And we got us a chauffeur?

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.390
Yes, sir, Mr. Brown.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.751
Give me the keys.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.580
How much they paying you, fella?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.260
About $600 a month, sir.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.900
$600?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.342
This here gonna cover you until
you get yourself a new job.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.220
I'm gonna drive myself.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.540
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.220
Don't mention it.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.180
That's $600 a month
going somewhere else.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.100
I hope the car is acceptable.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.060
Oh, no, we could work with it.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.620
- But you gonna like this catfish.
- I'm stuffed.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.620
Nah, I don't want to hear it!

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.101
See, Pop...

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.660
- I've been meaning to ask you something.
- What's that, Jimmy?

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.660
I only got a seventh grade education,
so you gonna have to excuse me.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.820
I'm looking through the figures
there and it occurred to me

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.100
we don't pay the promoter,

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.264
the promoter pay us.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.501
Let me explain how it works.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.140
When we book a show. Chicago.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.380
Our promoter in Chicago
there is Lenny J. Frank.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.140
Now, Lenny J. Frank
has been the top

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.780
promoter in Chicago
for the past 20 years.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.182
What if we take the gate?

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.620
What if we take it ourself?

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.864
And still get the show promoted,
but better.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.271
See, Pop,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.780
we go to the radio station.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.140
I understand your frustration, Jimmy,

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.660
but you're entering a game here
where the rules are already set.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.700
Say you're a ball player.
You walk on the field.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.540
You can't change how many
innings are being played.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.780
That's American baseball.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.620
I mean, you know, it's like golf.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.340
I mean, you gonna play 18 holes,
scored a certain way.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.700
That's the way the scoring is.
That's the system.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.500
It's like you're in a sand trap, right?

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.500
What do you wanna do?
Use a putter in a sand trap?

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.061
Can't do it.
Can't do it.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.820
You get my point, right?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.300
Okay, listen up, people.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.660
We go up to the young cats.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.740
The hungry cats.
The late-night cats.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.020
The 20-year-old white DJ
from Richmond, Virginia,

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.540
who ain't getting paid nothing.
He only doing it 'cause he love the music.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.500
We go to him, and we ask him

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.700
if he want to be the sole James Brown

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.780
promoter for the Richmond show.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.540
For a percentage.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.465
He gonna say...

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.700
Are you kidding me?
Do you know how much they pay me?

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.420
Between nothing and $50 a week.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.220
But he love my music.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.700
Oh, he dig himself some James Brown.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.860
And he got a microphone and a turntable

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.580
and four hours of airtime to kill.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.740
Screw payola.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.141
See?

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.060
This is Alan Leeds coming back at ya.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.460
Now with his new hit Papa's
Got a Brand New Bag,

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.340
it's James Brown.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.900
And at the end he gonna say...

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.340
And make sure you catch James Brown

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.260
at the arena in Richmond this Tuesday.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.460
And see, 'cause he young, he 20.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.460
And he got strong legs
and he know everybody.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.220
He know the cats at the pool hall.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.820
He know the guy at the barber shop.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.870
He know the fella down
at the garage. See, Pop,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.986
that's how we get our record
played outside payola.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.740
That's how we get our show promoted

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.142
better, harder, stronger.
Oh, and, Pop,

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.949
that's how we keeps the gate.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.024
You see, the best part is you can
put it all through the system.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.301
Item. Promoter.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.540
Pop, if the show sell, and it's selling,

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.939
we talking about thousands
of dollars a night.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.580
Difference per year between
two and three million dollars.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.779
And I'm out of a job.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.779
You forget I don't only
work for James Brown.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.620
Yeah, that's my next point.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.020
Why not?

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.779
See, Pop, I can do something for ya,

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.140
and you can do something for me,

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.020
and it ain't buy me no Cadillac.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.902
You buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac?

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.020
Come on, Pop, you see where
this thing is going.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.866
I got other people
around me don't see it.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.386
Go on and taste the fish, Pop.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.740
- Now you gonna need some hot sauce.
- No, can't have that.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.823
Hey, you gonna need some.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.979
Who's this?

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.260
Man, James gonna wear that seat out.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.420
Which seat?

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.819
Hers or the bus?

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.861
Oh.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.060
I'm Yvonne Fair. I'm a singer.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.939
Let me worry about my own seat.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.741
This is a man's world

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.342
This is a man's world

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.660
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.301
Without a woman or a girl

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:30.180
You see man made the cars

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.981
To take us over the road

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.140
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.500
To carry the heavy load

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.789
Police have the same problem.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.340
Man made the electric light
To keep us out of the dark

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.500
Man made the boat for the water

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.390
Like Noah made the ark

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.149
This is a man's, man's, man's world

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.820
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.507
Without a woman or a girl

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.100
And after man's made everything

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.025
Everything he can

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.981
Do you know that man makes money

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.420
Yeah!

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.266
To buy from other man

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.260
This is a man's world

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.023
I don't want to live here
Without a woman or a girl

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.901
A man needs a woman

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.868
He needs a woman

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.660
Woman

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.789
He needs a woman

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.940
Woman

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.387
He needs a woman

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.387
You need a woman when you're feeling bad

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.821
Woman

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.340
You need a woman when you're feeling sad

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.741
Woman

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.460
You need a woman when
you're feeling glad

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.660
Woman

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.869
it's the best thing a man ever had

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.581
Woman

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.103
You need a woman in the morning

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.380
Woman

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.748
A woman's always right

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.900
Woman

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.507
You got to have a woman

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:23.980
Woman

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.462
Lord, you got to have a woman

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.221
Please

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.541
Please

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.107
Baby, I love you so

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.781
Please, please, please, please

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.260
Keep your eyes closed, Bobby.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.540
Keep them closed.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.060
- Is you peeking, brother?
- No.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.781
Don't try to look through no cracks.
I know you now.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.300
- You ready?
- Yep.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.065
You ready?

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.465
Ta-da!

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.150
Ain't that something?

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.540
Brother, that is something.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.780
Ain't that something?

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.340
JB.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.660
Can you dig that?

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.060
Now that's a bird, Bobby Byrd.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.660
Now here they come.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.820
You been crying, boy?

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.060
Oh, my word.
What is this?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.260
Boy, what's that shit round your mouth?

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.500
All that shit around his mouth,
that's impetigo.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.026
It's highly contagious.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.741
Come here.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.420
Which one of you cats want a
ride to Reno on Daddy's plane?

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.460
Me!

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.860
I'm just saying, I wouldn't
go too near Teddy.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.580
Not unless you want to catch it.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.420
Thank you, Velma.
I'll consider myself warned.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.660
Warned?

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.820
Honey, that's a whole
other conversation.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.420
Welcome to the family, Mrs. Brown.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.390
Thank you, Velma.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.151
You need anything?

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.990
I'm putting a big list
together right now.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.586
How you doing, boss?

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.061
Mr. Brown?

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.220
- Mr. Brown?
- The Journal, Mr. Brown?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.500
Right here in the blue.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.460
Thank you. Hi. Welcome
to Reno, Mr. Brown.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.660
Thank you.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.020
What exactly is the groove?

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.300
Well, the groove is something you feel.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.021
The groove is solid.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.140
It don't move.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.980
It's like a heartbeat.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.100
Driving everything inside you.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.820
Hard. Flat.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.541
Can you exactly define it?

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.900
I just did, lady.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.220
See, there's some things that
don't fit inside of a magazine.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.349
But you all feel it.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.380
You feel it, Teddy?

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.066
Yes, sir.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.871
Okay.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.026
What's your favorite food?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.823
Bobby, tell this pretty
white lady what we eat.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.586
Thank you.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.942
We eat everything.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.224
We do, too.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.785
Merry Christmas.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.540
Hey, little man,
you've been good this year?

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.700
Yes, Mr. Brown.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.068
All right, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.940
I know you've been good now.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.220
Merry Christmas.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.220
Hey, sweetheart!
You been naughty, you been nice?

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.500
- Nice.
- You been nice?

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.060
- Merry Christmas.
- Nice. Thank you, Mr. Brown.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.621
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.588
Merry Christmas.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.386
Merry Christmas.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.307
Hey, Merry Christmas, now.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.386
All right, move on, sir.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.990
Merry Christmas, man.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.789
All right.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.986
It was a good crowd today, baby.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.063
You want me to make you some dinner?

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.700
You gonna stand up in my yard,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.420
dressed like that for every man to see?

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.069
Cover yourself.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.700
That mean I got to get that punch.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.784
See? Now, if I do one of these...

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.580
Got to give it some heat.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.900
I need that heat!
You see?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.500
I might do it on this side.
See that there?

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.940
Heat.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.990
I need that heat.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.780
Mr. Brown, what's it mean when
you lift your shoulders and go...

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.980
Mitchell?

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.540
Cathy, it appears his hands are tied.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.940
These people are guests at the hotel.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.100
But so are we.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.660
- I know, sweetheart. Let's go.
- I don't understand.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.420
- Sir, we are good people.
- Cathy...

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.740
We have paid good money.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.060
We did not drive all the
way down to New Orleans

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.140
- to swim in a pool full of niggers!
- Entertainers!

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.500
Entertainers.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.420
You looking mighty good there,
Miss Anderson.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.267
You looking mighty good there,
too, Mr. Byrd.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.060
Give me some of that.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.747
You sure you want this, Vicki?

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.307
Don't be looking up there at Mr. Brown.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.706
Here.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.469
You keep your eyes focused on me.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.825
Later.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.591
Count on it.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.500
Man, he done called a rehearsal.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.820
When?

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.060
Right now.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.820
Oh, shit.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.710
Tell me you kidding.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.427
One! Two!

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.860
Hit it!

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.427
Quit it!

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.060
Clyde, I need that...

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.941
From the top!

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.147
From the top!

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.500
Understand?
It drop before the beat.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.660
You dig it?

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.620
Does he mean the top of the bar?

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.900
He means on a down beat.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.380
- All right.
- Mr. Brown?

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.020
Yes, Maceo.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.860
We rehearsed it just like you told us.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.580
We got it just like you like it.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.380
Jimmy can't play that
with the part he's got.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.540
We can change the part if you like.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.591
Don't change it.
Did I say change the part?

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.300
What's wrong?
You lost your soul?

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.460
You lost your feeling?

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.340
No, sir. I ain't lost no feeling.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.261
James.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.585
Rest of y'all lost your soul?

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.900
Come on now, James.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.586
You lost your feeling?

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.821
What's going on, Maceo?

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.100
- I said what's wrong, sir?
- James.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.821
You got something to say, Mr. Byrd?

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.784
'Cause a man got something
to say, he should just say it!

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.345
You got something to say?

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.221
Well...

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.348
No, sir, Mr. Brown.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.031
Well, then you're just holding
up the rehearsal, Mr. Byrd!

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.345
I can't have people
holding up the rehearsal!

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.260
If I can't do it right,

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.620
I ain't gonna do it at all!

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.620
We got to get on!
Get ahead!

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.340
Now you know the rules.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.900
If you're late, you're off,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.065
or you hold us up,
it's no good, Mr. Byrd.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.543
It's gonna cost you half a yard.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.420
Maceo, I like the part he playing.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.743
I just want it in a different place.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.025
What's this here?

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.460
A snare, Mr. Brown.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.660
A snare what?

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.940
Drum.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.626
Correct. What's this?

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.381
A guitar.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.346
No, it's not.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.345
Pee Wee, what's this?

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.860
Drum, Mr. Brown?

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.020
Now we getting it!

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.660
What's Maceo holding?

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.180
A drum, Mr. Brown.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.340
Fellas, what's them shiny things
y'all holding over there?

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.860
Drums.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.460
Now we all

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.420
got our drums.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.660
Now when you're playing a drum

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.460
it don't matter what key you in,

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.907
what bar you in,

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.500
what planet you on!

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.900
But, Mr. Brown.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.220
Clyde'll be in a different time
than the rest of the band.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.701
It doesn't work musically.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.102
How many hit records you got, sir?

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.460
Fellas, does it sound good?

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.380
- Yeah.
- Does it feel good?

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.906
Yeah.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.300
God made your ears.
You didn't make them.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.429
You gonna argue with God's ears?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.060
If it sound good and it feel good,
then it's musical.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.620
So, play it like I say play it.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.180
From the top!

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.789
One! Two! One, two!

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:30.980
Hit it!

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.625
Now we're talking!

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.709
I don't care

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.303
About your past

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.144
I just want

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.191
Our love to last

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.591
I don't care, darling

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.149
About your faults

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.428
I just want

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.868
To satisfy your pulse

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.151
Oh!

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.140
When you kiss me

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.580
When you mess me

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.222
Hold my hand

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.822
Make me understand

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.625
I break out

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.343
In a cold sweat

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.821
Get it

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.460
Bobby, James Brown is my meal ticket.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.900
So, I just shut my ears and
chomp down on his bullshit.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.189
But why you soak it up, man?

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.620
You his best friend.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.100
You known him a time, brother.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.911
And he treat you like that.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.346
If I was you, I'd bust
him in his damn mouth.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.350
I hang in there

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.907
because I remember the day I knew,

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.300
knew I was never gonna be in front.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.340
You work so hard at this one thing,

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.187
and one day you realize
it ain't supposed to be you.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.180
But James,
he's supposed to be in front.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.706
I saw it happen.

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.420
And the man in front
got to be the man in front.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.340
Now it ain't gonna be
pretty all the time,

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.028
but it's the man's responsibility
if he want to stay there.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.503
And you and me, we can't know that.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.826
We're not supposed to.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.020
So, don't lie to yourself, Maceo.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.580
Every man in this band walk taller

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.860
'cause he with James Brown.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:13.266
Every man in this band believes
in himself a little more

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.620
'cause he with James Brown.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.626
You sure you just ain't too
scared to be in the front?

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.910
Open up your ears.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.220
Mine are open.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.022
The man's a genius,
and he's taking us with him.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.860
DeeDee?

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.060
DeeDee Brown!

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.460
I'm up here, baby.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.907
DeeDee!

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.584
Woman, I called you yesterday.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.471
You wasn't home?

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.260
I was home all day.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.662
You were home all day?
Why didn't you pick up?

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.580
I don't know.
What time did you call?

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.340
I called you at 1:00.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.820
And I called you again a quarter after.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.260
I called you again at 2:00,
and then I called you at 3:00.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.940
Well, you must have wanted
to talk to me pretty bad.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.501
Where were ya?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.220
In the bathtub.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.667
For two hours?

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.869
You want me to take shorter baths?

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.822
We don't have a phone
in the bathroom, James.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.501
Well, damn!
What are you gonna do?

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.345
You gonna fine me?

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.146
James.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.580
James.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.907
Now we got a phone in the bathroom!

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.982
No, I ain't gonna fine you.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.586
You fine enough already.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.351
Then get on up here, Mr. Dynamite.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.228
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.546
Popcorn

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.622
Some like 'em fat and some like 'em tall

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.546
Some like 'em short

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.945
Skinny legs and all

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.661
I like 'em all

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.070
I like 'em proud

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.020
And when they walk

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.940
You know they draw a crowd

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.341
See

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.189
You gotta have a mother for me

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.510
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.221
Quit it!

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.540
Something missing.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.941
You know, Pee Wee,

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.100
why don't you go on up to the
mic and bring that horn box.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.220
That's where you keep the wig, ain't it?

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.908
Some like 'em fat
and some like 'em tall

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.831
I like 'em proud

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.860
And when they walk

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.700
They always draw a crowd

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.101
See

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.260
Hey, you got to have a mother for me

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.226
He think he got me down, don't he?

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.301
It's Dr. King.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.740
They shot Dr. King.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.260
Dr. Martin Luther King
has been killed by

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.186
an assassin's bullet
in Memphis, Tennessee.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.540
I just got off the phone with
the Mayor of Boston's office.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.900
He wanted us to know they're canceling

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.620
the show at the Garden tomorrow night.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.260
- What?
- He's worried about rioting.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.740
Tell that man I sold 30 million records

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.740
and 95% of 'em was in the black community!
They listen to me!

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.980
Politics 101. Don't put
10,000 angry blacks

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.580
in one place in the middle of the city

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.580
and broadcast it live to the world.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.180
Mr. Mayor, the way I see it,

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.980
you already lost your next election.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.380
You lost it at 7:05 p.m., Memphis time.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.580
You're asking me to put the
future of my city in your hands.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.780
And tomorrow night,

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.220
you either got 10,000 angry
folk in the Boston Garden

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.700
or you got 10,000 angry
folk on your front lawn.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.431
So, all I ask you tonight is this...

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.744
To let us look at each other,

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.303
here in the Garden and back at home,

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.860
and pledge that no matter what
any other community might do,

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.709
we, in Boston, will honor
Dr. King in peace.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.460
Thank you.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.900
Before we get into this
next thing, I just want to say

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.029
he's a young man, you dig?

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.423
He's a young man,
so he's thinking together.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.150
The young man is together.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.509
Give him another round of applause.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.500
Two, three, four...

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.269
I got the feelin', baby

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.902
Baby, I got the feelin', now

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.666
Sometimes I roam

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.583
But I'll be coming back home

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.428
Sometimes I seem to be fly

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.582
You don't know, mama

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.860
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.420
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.540
Come on

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.944
Yeah

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.021
All right

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.701
Let's go

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.907
Get off! Get off the stage!

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.700
When you touch me

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.062
When you touch me
Good God

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.511
Can't stand your love

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.785
Can't stand it

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.145
Can't stand your love

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.542
When you touch me
Good God

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.380
You touch me

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.671
Can't stand your love

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.740
Wait a minute.

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.220
Step off Move off

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.190
Oh, no.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.503
I'll be fine. I'll be all right.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.951
You wanna dance?

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.300
Let him go. Let him go.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.860
You wanna dance?

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.660
You dance.
Let him go.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.304
Leave them alone.
Let them go.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.624
I'll be fine.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.388
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.420
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.020
Let me finish the show
for everybody else.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.865
Everybody else want to see the show.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.140
You got to show that you're men,
young men and young ladies.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.541
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.300
Ladies and gentlemen!
This is no way! We are black!

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.304
We are black!

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.384
Let's represent ourselves now!

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.620
Go back down.
Y'all go back down.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.100
Nobody else come back up here.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.980
Let's represent ourselves.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.260
No, you make me look bad.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.940
We are black,
don't make us all look bad.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.980
Get on back down, son.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.340
Sir, why are you up here?

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.107
You want to see the show, then go
back down, let me do the show.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.587
You ain't doing right by
yourself or me either.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.300
I asked the police to step back

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.385
'cause I figure I could get some
respect from my own people!

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.744
Don't make no sense.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.020
Now, are we together or we ain't?

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.300
Hit that thing, man.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.147
When you touch me

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.222
When you touch me
Good God

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.620
I can't stand it

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.950
I can't stand your love

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.790
They got kids out there that can't eat,

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.140
robbing and stealing and doing
what they got to do to survive.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.588
And if we don't do something about it,
we gonna lose the country.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.700
I go to Harlem, I talk to Rap Brown,

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.940
I talk to the Nation of Islam,

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.468
and you white folk tell
me I'm a separatist.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.740
Now we headed to the White House,

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.666
and them same brothers
telling me I'm Uncle Tom.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.100
So what I'm supposed to do, Pop?

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.940
Write a check to Rap Brown so he
can buy rifles and machine guns

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.740
and rally on 125th Street
and take it south?

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.189
What it say to you, Pop?

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:45.460
A street kid from Augusta, Georgia,

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.540
headed to the White House right now.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.261
It says you're kissing
up to The Man, James.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:56.420
So, you telling me to turn this plane
around and stand up the President?

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.460
No. I'm saying you're
screwed already, man.

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.900
Think about it.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.140
You stand up Lyndon Johnson
and go kiss up to the Panthers,

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:06.191
you ain't gonna be playing
in Vegas anytime soon.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.945
Because if they know
you can stop a riot,

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.740
they'll sure as hell
expect you to start one.

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.829
So here I am, just a sorry soul
brother whining on his private jet.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.749
With a tired, old, lucky Jew.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.904
James, look at me.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.107
Don't you be scared, my friend.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.260
Because if you're scared,

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.822
it does not end well for the black man.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.700
Just do your thing, James.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.467
It's worked for you so far.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.421
Make a circle around.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.260
Make a circle around.
Make a circle around.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.500
How y'all doing?

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.020
- Great.
- Good.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.540
Good. It's good to have you here.

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.460
Now we brought y'all here today

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.860
to tell you something very important.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.180
I want you all to know that you
can do anything you want in life.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.020
And let nobody tell you
any different. Understand?

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.421
Yes, sir.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.665
I want y'all to repeat after me.
If you want it...

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.940
If you want it...

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.100
...you got to learn it.

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.380
...you got to learn it.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.700
Then you got to build it...

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.260
Then you got to build it...

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.780
And then we can earn it.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.020
Then we can earn it.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.940
That's the money and
that's the respect now.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.260
Hey, you think if they mess up,
he gonna take their pocket money?

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.180
All right, let's make some music.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.540
One, two, three, four.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.260
With your bad self

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.946
Say it loud

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.740
I'm black and I'm proud

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.020
One more time

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.380
Say it loud

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.191
I'm black and I'm proud

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.270
I worked on jobs

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.550
With my feet and my hands

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:57.060
But all the work I did
was for the other man

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.821
And now we demand a chance
to do things for ourselves

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.220
We're tired of beating our
head against the wall

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.780
And working for someone else

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.181
Say it loud

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.230
I'm black and I'm proud

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.460
Say it loud

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.305
I'm black and I'm proud

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.500
Say it loud

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.901
I'm black and I'm proud

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.866
James.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.860
You the man, Teddy Brown?

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.180
I'm the man, Mr. Brown.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.945
That's right.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.700
Gertrude, the band ready?

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.020
They ready,
Mr. Brown.

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.180
It don't look like it.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.940
Come on, boy.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.581
Check out how Papa don't take no mess.

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:15.986
Fellas...

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.380
Y'all cats act like y'all
don't know what time it is.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.900
You better get them horns
out and them sticks ready.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.940
Or I'll start raining down fines.

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.105
I've been elected spokesman
on behalf of the band.

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.585
Spokesman? Elected?

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.540
We asked to be paid on time.

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.146
We haven't been paid in weeks.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.980
We asked to have scheduled days off.

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.303
Every day off we get,
you make us rehearse.

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.580
We asked to get paid for recordings,

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.142
but you just include it in our salary.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:49.340
Teddy, go on and wait outside.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.980
Yes, sir.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.340
Fellas, I hear ya.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.100
I really do.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.300
And I appreciate your honesty.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.940
Can't be easy. No, sir.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.940
You got your grievances.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.580
You got yourselves to think about.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.584
Hell, you're men!

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.140
I dig it.

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.191
I don't think you understand,
Mr. Brown, sir.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.270
We know you owe the
government back taxes.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.940
Your restaurant, radio stations,

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.860
your recording studios, labels,

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.780
all different businesses,

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.860
all kind of cash passing between them,

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.980
unaccounted for.
It's a mess, Mr. Brown.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.820
And if you want us to be a part of it,
we gonna need our cash, too.

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.180
Right now!

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.620
And most of all, none of us
wants to be fined for anything,

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.021
ever again.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.185
You know what I'm gonna do.

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.990
I'm gonna think about it.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.140
That's all.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.711
You son of a bitch!

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.860
Son, what you say to me?

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.980
Fuck you!

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.620
You better get on out of here right...

01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.500
You ain't gonna make
me come out myself!

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.820
You better get on out of here right now!

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.063
Go! Get the hell out!

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.941
Bobby, it's like I always say,

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.700
you got to know who you are,

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.500
you got to know where
you are in this world.

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.820
Five minutes ago, them boys was
the baddest band on the planet!

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.180
Now they nothing!

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.660
Just a bunch of sidemen with
their hearts beating fast.

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.660
I ain't no slave driver. I just
want you to do right by yourself!

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:33.303
Maceo, come in here talking
about my taxes! My taxes!

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.306
All I've done for this country and
they come after James Brown! Why?

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.740
You can't make everybody happy!

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.380
And still stay on top!

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.020
Nah.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.945
You don't get it!

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.700
They don't get it.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.422
You say "fuck you" to James Brown!

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.988
You along for the ride,

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.180
long as everything is groovy, but then
you're gonna kick me when I'm down.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.380
Well, you think I'm down!

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.101
'Cause James Brown ain't never down!

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.700
Nah. You're either on the train or
you off it. Go on, get on out of here.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.670
Get on out of here!

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.145
Go on!

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.264
You might can catch them.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.908
They're gonna need themselves a singer.

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.060
Negro, what makes
you think I'm leaving?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:29.623
I've been here this long,
and I'm still here.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.667
See, that's the thing about the funk.

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.140
The funk don't quit.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.380
Last time I checked.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.740
Because if the funk up
and quit, then that's it.

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.060
That's why the funk don't quit.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.100
Are we done, Mr. Byrd?

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.300
I'm afraid not, Mr. Brown.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.500
I said, are we done?

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.551
I think we still got
more funk in the trunk.

01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.980
Say, who those kids from Cincinnati?
The Blackenizers.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.500
Who that young cat that play bass?

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.900
- Bootsy.
- Bootsy.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.825
Yeah, call him up.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.506
Call him up.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.220
Men gotta work hard if
they want to break ground.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.271
We breaking new ground every day.

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.900
My record Live at the Apollo

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.500
is the first R&B album in the history
of the world to reach top 10.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.820
Stayed up there for 66 weeks.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.780
Man, that record come across.
I mean, it hit hard!

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.311
Slowly but surely, the whole
world knew who we were.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.900
See, in show business there's two parts.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.660
There's a show

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.660
and there's a business.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.340
Brothers and sisters,

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.742
you better believe I'm both.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.060

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.666

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.420
- You gonna take it to the bridge?
- Take 'em to the bridge

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.380
- Take 'em to the bridge
- Take 'em to the bridge

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.340
- Take them all the way
- Right on

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.660
- To the boogie room
- All the way

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.347
- Take 'em all the way
- All the way

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.141
Come on

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.180
Feel it

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.591

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.181
I got mine

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.546
Don't worry about his

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.540
- Take 'em back
- Right to the top

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.660
- Way back
- All the way back

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.620

Get on up

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.660

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.420
- Baby

- Come on
- Get on up

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.025
Get on up

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.621

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.860

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.183
Shake your money maker

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.145
Shake your money maker

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.430
Shake your money maker

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.140
Bobby Byrd

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:49.700

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.940
I got that thing

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.780
That tells me what it's all about

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.591
I've got soul

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.861
And I'm super bad

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.541
I've got soul

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.549

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.947

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.541

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.661

Come on

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.380
We did it, didn't we?

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.220
A good show tonight.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.509
You know what I think, James?

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:22.189
Maybe I can play Paris or the Apollo.

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.060
How's that?

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.860
I'm saying, we put out my next record,

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.580
I bet I can fill this place

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.745
all by myself. No problem.

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.620
Fellas, we're gonna need some privacy.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.460
You can finish it up later.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.350
Thank you, fellas.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.870
Now, what the hell you talking about?

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.580
What? You saying I'm slipping?

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.020
No, James, I'm not saying you slipping.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.860
You James Brown.
You ain't never slipping.

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.866
People copy me,
Mr. Byrd. They copy me.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.020
People gonna copy my moves until
the Earth go dark, you understand?

01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.460
Now you think people
gonna buy that record,

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.700
your record,

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.300
like they buy my record?
That's what you saying?

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.620
No, James, that's not what I'm saying.

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.940
But forget about it, never mind.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.502
Who you been telling this to?

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.980
You been saying this to
the people at the Apollo?

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:13.820
No, I ain't been saying it
to the people at the Apollo.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.100
You the only one I told this to.

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.231
I ain't said it to
nobody but you, James.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:20.981
We just talking.

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.660
And I thought you'd be cool with that.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:26.620
I try to produce a record for you,
you let it go to your head.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:28.380
You go talking big behind my back.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.340
- You go sneaking around.
- I never talk big behind your back.

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.660
Making heat on another man's name.

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:33.980
And now we're here,
we're doing something,

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.340
and you making plans, sucker?

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.540
I ain't never made plans!

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.381
And I ain't never talked about you
behind your back! Now, that's it!

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.311
I'm ashamed of you, Mr. Byrd.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.740
You ashamed of me?

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.904
You ought to be ashamed of you.

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.220
Now you're trying to
run around with Vicki.

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.620
Don't jive yourself, brother.
Don't jive yourself!

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.820
Now, Vicki,

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:56.188
Vicki could fill this place.

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.020
That's true, James, she could.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.140
But Vicki ain't yours.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.464
And me and Vicki ain't none
of your damn business.

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.180
She could have been my business before.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.700
You stepping too far, James.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.307
You are stepping too far!

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.380
I can't do this no more.

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:26.220
You're damn right,
you can't do this no more.

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:29.464
No, I can't do this no more, James!

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.271
I can't.

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.184
And the funny part...

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.142
Funny part is, is you say that like
it's some kind of big thing to me.

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:55.340
Like, "Oh, my God!

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:59.180
"Bobby Byrd gonna leave
James Brown on his own.

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.070
"What he gonna do?"

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.662
Oh! Oh!

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.940
No, the funny thing is, James,

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.990
ain't nobody leaving you on your own.

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.903
You already on your own.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.704
You always were.

01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:25.704
Where you going, Mr. Byrd?

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.541
Bobby, I said, where you going?

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.340
All right, that's enough.
Thank you, fella.

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.821
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.060
Bobby,

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.940
get everybody out of here.
Go wait outside.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.183
Okay. Everybody out!

01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.620
Everybody out.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.180
You heard the man.
Come on, baby.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.940
Put some pep in your step.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.186
I was on the subway the other day,

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.790
and these little boys
sitting over me arguing...

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:23.100
Talking about who's better,
James Brown or Little Willie John.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.940
This little boy,
he got so mad, he said,

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.900
"James Brown, ain't nobody
better than James Brown."

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.110
He started dancing and carrying on.

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.429
I was so proud.

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.831
Why tonight?

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.064
Why you come here

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.185
tonight?

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.586
Well, sugar...

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.462
I live in Brooklyn,

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.940
and my baby playing at the Apollo.

01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.627
I don't want you to feel proud.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:05.030
I ain't your sugar. I ain't your baby.

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:08.300
Not then. Not now.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.909
And I don't want you to
tell nobody you my mama

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.582
because me and you
know that ain't true.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.181
Well...

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.548
Well, I ain't never wanna be no mama.

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.180
But you were inside of me,

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.105
I carried you,

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.623
I had you, so I chose you.

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.020
You chose me?

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.831
I chose you.

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:46.707
See, I thought about this a lot.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.905
A whole lot.

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.464
I know it wasn't personal.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.670
That's why this ain't neither.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.385
I ain't need you.

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.549
Turned out fine

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.820
because I ain't need you.

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:10.064
I look after James Brown.
Made sure he was okay.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.426
No one else.

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:16.149
No one else helped me.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.786
Well...

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.347
You know, I hadn't had nothing
to make no choice with.

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.550
I ain't know nothing
about being no wife.

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.584
I didn't know nothing
about being no mama.

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.431
I didn't know nothing about nothing.

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.984
Just country.

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.140
All your daddy did was beat on me.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:50.781
And beat you real bad.

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.671
But I loved-ed you, so I stayed.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.190
And I left...

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.703
Because I loved you.

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:08.222
And then I was gone.

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.300
And I did the best I could.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.225
I did that.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.624
I did.

01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.824
And I'm ashamed.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.949
And now look at you.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.509
Don't cry now.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.470
Don't do it.

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:52.781
Don't cry. Here.

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.146
Clean yourself up.

01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.384
There ain't nothing to cry about.
I'm James Brown.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.102
James Brown don't need nothing.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.107
James Brown don't need no one.

01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.662
Now, why are you really here?

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.668
What do you really want?

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.347
Here.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.428
Here's a hundred dollars.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.503
Sorry, but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave now.

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.110
You're so pretty.

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:20.349
You're so beautiful.

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.988
Make sure she's taken care of.

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.744
Anything she need.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:14.180
- James?
- Hey, Velma.

01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.423
There's been a car accident.

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.306
He's gone, James.

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.625
Teddy's gone.

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.180
You special, boy.

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.180
What happened to you?

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:43.106
- You got the spirit in you.
- Play it like I say play it.

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:48.060
I figure I could get some
respect from my own people.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.500
I talk to the Nation of Islam, and you
white folk tell me I'm a separatist.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.860
Do you know what you want?

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.380
You special.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.111
What happened to you?

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.904
Are we together, or we ain't?

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:00.540
You already on your own.

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.300
You ain't gonna make me come out myself!

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.980
You better get on out of here right now!

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.500
- You miss your mama, boy?
- Play it like I say play it.

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:08.380
I'm not the white devil.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.740
Do as I say, not as I do.

01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:13.100
Their needs is what's
going to sell the policy.

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.871
Go on now.

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:28.660
You better move on!

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.471
- Stop!
- Get out of the way!

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.501
Get out of the car!

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:23.220
You ain't got me!

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.904
You think you got me?

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.025
They ain't got me.

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.145
Come on, Brown.

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.025
Come on, Brown!

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.420
Yeah.

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.981
Yeah!

02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.270
Come on, Brown!

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:38.870
Come on, Brown!

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:44.944
Come on, Brown!

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.705
Come on, Brown!

02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.111
James Brown.

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.060
Morning, Mr. Byrd.

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.340
Morning, Billy.

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.260
Come to shut down that pool.

02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:08.740
I got a real algae problem back there.

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.900
I'll take a look.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.660
Sure. If you need anything, come inside.

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:13.300
Yes, sir.

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.427
James.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.949
What you doing out here
in your pajamas, Mr. Byrd?

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.980
I come out to sneak a smoke.

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.030
Supposed to quit. Vicki don't know.

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.023
I ain't gonna tell it.

02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.540
I was just passing...

02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:01.340
Got a show at the Omni tonight.

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.026
Right.

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:06.705
Say, maybe you and Vicki
want to come along.

02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.030
Got a hot new horn section.

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.866
Tight.

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:12.940
We're coming along, Mr. Byrd.

02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.980
We got plans, James.

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.382
Vicki family coming over.

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.350
Well, you think about it.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.550
See what Vicki say.

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.547
Yeah.

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:31.742
She still in charge.

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:38.190
You're looking well.

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.500
You know, I just get
stronger and stronger.

02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.743
Get better and better every day.

02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.660
I ain't seen you since...

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.340
- Teddy's funeral.
- Right.

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.265
Teddy's funeral.

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:53.980
Well, you looking damn good.
I wish you would have called...

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.145
We brought him home to Augusta,
though, didn't we, Mr. Byrd?

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.543
We brought him on home.

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.424
Sent him on to the Lord.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.981
Okay, Mr. Byrd.

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:08.540
Fixed your problem.

02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.146
I'll be back in the
spring to open her up.

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:13.389
Excuse me, Mr. Brown.

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.821
We come a long way,
haven't we, Mr. Byrd?

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.782
Got white folk cleaning our pool.

02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.302
Yeah, we come a long way, James.

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.466
You still making the steps?

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.991
Here and there.

02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:54.505
Maybe you and Vicki got a friend

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.269
who could use them.

02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:02.503
Good seats, too.

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:09.144
See you around, Mr. Byrd.

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:34.140
How we doing out there, Gertie?

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.820
To the rafters, Mr. Brown.

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:37.710
To the rafters.

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:39.820
That's good.

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:43.863
Why don't y'all give me a minute?

02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.591
James Brown.

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:22.147
James Brown, James Brown,

The more you give,
the more you're blessed!

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.220
You just got to have faith!

02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.220
And you can move a mountain!

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.987
I paid the cost to be the boss.

James Brown. James Brown.

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.750

02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:02.060
Get up off of that thing

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.060
And dance till you feel better

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:05.900
Get up off of that thing

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.100
And dance till you

02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:08.340
Sing it now

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:10.260
Get up off of that thing

And dance till you feel better

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.300
Get up off of that thing

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.140
And try to release that pressure

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:17.180
Pressure

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.420
Get up off of that thing

And shake till you feel better

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.460
Get up off of that thing

02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:32.783
And try to release that pressure

02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:35.101
Hit me
