00:01.566 --> 00:03.568
<i>Previously on</i> S.W.A.T....It's my mom, isn't it?

00:03.612 --> 00:07.050
- Your mother passed away.
- There were no signs
of force or trauma.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.313
- But drugs.
- Paraphernalia and residue.

00:09.357 --> 00:12.012
I donated a piece of my liver
in a risky surgery,

00:12.055 --> 00:13.665
and she O.D.'s.
I loved her,

00:13.709 --> 00:15.580
but at least now
I know she's at peace.

00:15.624 --> 00:16.799
<i>I couldn't live with myself</i>

00:16.842 --> 00:18.801
if I hadn't given her
every chance.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.629
I really admired you
for doing that for her.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.848
20-Squad's
- been reinstated.
- Who's team leader?

00:22.892 --> 00:24.024
<i>- Sanchez.
- How are you?</i>

00:24.067 --> 00:25.025
<i>There's no way</i>

00:25.068 --> 00:26.287
a guy like Sanchez

00:26.330 --> 00:27.810
comes back here
without an agenda.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.029
I know about your orders
with the commission.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.291
He's trying to
get me to quit

00:30.334 --> 00:31.466
as payback
for being a whistleblower.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.597
If it wasn't me,

00:32.641 --> 00:34.295
they would just send
somebody else.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.775
Second-guessing me
in front of the team.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.734
Textbook insubordination.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.649
Strike two. One more
and you're looking

00:40.692 --> 00:42.477
at a mandatory
disciplinary hearing.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.479
Sticking around SWAT will be
death by a thousand pinpricks,

00:44.522 --> 00:45.871
but that's your choice.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.699
And I'm just fine
with my choices.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.700
What about you, Sanchez?

00:48.744 --> 00:49.962
I take it you
filled them in?

00:50.006 --> 00:51.007
You've done
so much for all of us.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.314
It's time for us
to return the favor.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.402
You don't need to face this
on your own.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.577
So we're in agreement,

00:55.620 --> 00:57.883
we solve this problem
once and for all.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.411
- Mm.
- Hmm.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.587
Baby, I wish we could
stay here all day.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.416
Mm, it's nice having the place
to ourselves.

01:08.459 --> 01:09.721
Mm-hmm.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.681
I got to say, though,
it's a little too quiet.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.509
No Pops singing
in the shower,

01:14.552 --> 01:17.512
Darryl walking around
banging doors.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.340
When are your mom
and dad back?

01:19.383 --> 01:20.993
I have no idea.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.039
I mean, it's weird enough that
they went on vacation together

01:23.083 --> 01:25.041
35 years after getting
a divorce, but...

01:25.085 --> 01:26.564
now they make
it sound like

01:26.608 --> 01:28.566
they're gonna live out their
retirement on a cruise ship.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.874
I can think of worse ways
to spend my golden years.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.354
Hmm. Yeah.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.703
How are you feeling

01:34.746 --> 01:37.401
about them rekindling
their relationship?

01:39.186 --> 01:42.667
As long as my pops
is good to my mom...

01:42.711 --> 01:44.104
I'm okay with it.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.369
I guess we got to
get the day started.

01:48.412 --> 01:49.457
Mmm.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.112
Let's go.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.072
How's Darryl doing?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.639
He's doing great.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.902
Kid moves into his own place,
and he magically learns

01:59.945 --> 02:01.425
the art of
washing dishes.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.166
It's called "adulting,"

02:03.210 --> 02:05.386
and it's good for him
to be independent.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.735
Yeah.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.954
He still comes over
when he runs out of milk.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.522
Corner store's a little closer,
but, you know...

02:11.566 --> 02:13.089
Mmm.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.657
I'm proud of him.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.487
The garage is doing okay,

02:19.530 --> 02:22.011
he's acing his college classes,
and he paid back

02:22.054 --> 02:23.708
most of the money that
he borrowed from me

02:23.752 --> 02:25.841
- to start the business.
- That's great.

02:25.884 --> 02:29.018
I told you his plan was solid.
I'm glad you listened to me.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.628
I'm glad I did, too.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.891
And I'll be doing a whole lot
more of that in the future.

02:32.935 --> 02:33.979
That a promise?

02:34.023 --> 02:34.980
Yes, honey.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.164
Something else the matter
besides empty-nest syndrome?

02:45.252 --> 02:46.818
Damn, woman.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.038
I forgot how hard it is
to hide anything from you.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.132
When I got back from Mexico,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.788
I had a real clear idea
of what I wanted.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.442
You.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.142
And I also had
a sense of purpose.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.492
I knew I wanted to be a bridge
between the LAPD

03:08.536 --> 03:10.494
and the community. I just...

03:12.017 --> 03:14.542
I didn't realize
how hard it was gonna be.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.152
No one at LAPD
is real interested

03:16.196 --> 03:18.154
in hearing what I have to say
at the moment.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.851
Mm, that's got to be
frustrating.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.505
Yeah.

03:22.637 --> 03:23.681
But...

03:23.725 --> 03:25.509
I'll figure it out.

03:25.553 --> 03:26.641
In the meantime,

03:26.684 --> 03:28.599
I got to figure out breakfast.

03:28.643 --> 03:29.818
Pancakes?

03:29.861 --> 03:31.167
Sounds good.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.212
Coming right up.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.478
<i>Some nutjob</i>

03:37.521 --> 03:39.044
sent the mayor anthrax
through the mail.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.611
I-I spotted the envelope.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.091
The address
looked like some toddler

03:42.134 --> 03:44.615
had written it with his hands
tied behind his back.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.922
Anyway, the FBI said that
the mayor would've died

03:46.965 --> 03:48.576
if it wasn't for me.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.839
Morning.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.623
Yo, I had this super cool
date last night.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.016
You want to hear
the juicy deets?

03:54.059 --> 03:56.061
I just ate breakfast.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.846
I took this woman Angie out
for sushi.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.674
Angie used to be
a pro surfer

03:59.717 --> 04:01.545
but who now happens to work
for the mayor.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.025
Took me three rounds of sake,

04:03.068 --> 04:05.506
but I got her to spill the 411
on Sanchez.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.508
- Lay it on me.
- She said this guy

04:07.551 --> 04:09.118
on the police commission,
Miles Kosas,

04:09.161 --> 04:11.207
offered to pull strings at CHP

04:11.251 --> 04:12.252
and get Sanchez a job

04:12.295 --> 04:14.123
on the governor's
protection detail

04:14.166 --> 04:16.038
if he can get Hondo
to quit SWAT.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.040
Sanchez couldn't keep his mouth
shut about it, apparently.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.521
Governor's detail?
- That's a prime gig.
- Yeah, which is why Sanchez

04:20.564 --> 04:23.567
is on such a mission
to get Hondo out the door.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.916
Always chasing the prize.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.658
So what are we gonna do?

04:27.702 --> 04:29.791
Well, we make him realize
that it's mission impossible.

04:29.834 --> 04:30.879
If we can
convince Sanchez

04:30.922 --> 04:33.229
that Hondo's
not going anywhere...

04:33.273 --> 04:35.013
maybe he throws in the towel.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.580
Okay.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.891
What's up?

04:42.934 --> 04:47.199
My mom's funeral is
this afternoon, and...

04:47.243 --> 04:49.985
doesn't look
like anyone's gonna be there.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.769
No one?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.771
Except for me and the chaplain.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.947
And one of us is getting paid.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.949
It's just depressing.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.908
Imagine dying and
no one showing up

04:59.951 --> 05:01.910
to say goodbye.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.087
A hundred people showed up
to my mom's funeral.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.263
Most of them
just for the open bar after.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.265
It's not about
how many people turn up.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.747
The funeral's for you,
no one else.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.226
It's your chance to say goodbye.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.277
At my mom's funeral,
my, uh... my Uncle Sarzo gave me

05:21.321 --> 05:24.236
a white rose to lay
on the coffin.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.109
I was so angry at her for
getting behind the wheel drunk,

05:27.152 --> 05:30.025
for... for dying...

05:30.068 --> 05:32.375
I didn't even make it
halfway up the aisle.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.247
I ran out of the church,
and I...

05:35.291 --> 05:37.685
I walked all the way home
in the rain.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.818
I threw the rose in the trash
the moment I got there.

05:43.691 --> 05:47.259
It's one of the biggest regrets
of my life,

05:47.303 --> 05:49.261
not saying goodbye properly.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.832
Don't make that mistake, okay?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.315
<i>The United States is</i>

05:59.359 --> 06:01.709
the only country in the world
where you see gunmen

06:01.752 --> 06:03.928
routinely slaughtering large
groups of people at random.

06:03.972 --> 06:04.973
Dial it up.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.496
Come on.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.889
She's running circles
around you.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.107
A lot of people claim

06:09.151 --> 06:11.675
many of these so-called
terrorist attacks

06:11.719 --> 06:13.634
and mass shootings
are false flag events

06:13.677 --> 06:14.809
sanctioned by the deep state,

06:14.852 --> 06:16.637
so they can take away
our freedoms.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.160
Show me the proof.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.161
You're talking

06:19.204 --> 06:21.032
about ripping up
the Constitution.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.121
The Second Amendment's
a constitutional relic.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.819
It was never meant
to be interpreted

06:24.862 --> 06:26.255
the way your side
is choosing to.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.430
The framers
were talking

06:27.474 --> 06:29.650
about a regulated militia
with muskets,

06:29.693 --> 06:30.825
not arming everyday idiots

06:30.868 --> 06:32.435
with assault rifles.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.872
People have a right
to defend themselves.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.787
The best way to stop
a bad guy with a gun

06:36.831 --> 06:38.441
is a good guy with a gun.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.443
That's great.
Keep stirring the pot.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.184
You can think all day long that
something won't happen to you,

06:42.227 --> 06:44.447
but if it does,
you're not gonna be prepared.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.840
You'll be a sitting duck.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.711
Andrea makes a great point.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.713
More guns in the world
is not the answer.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.062
Go, go, go, go!

06:51.106 --> 06:52.063
- What's going on?
- Nobody move!

06:52.107 --> 06:53.064
Stay where you are.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.065
Don't you move.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.458
Keep the cameras on.

06:58.722 --> 06:59.984
Hi. Yes, we need help.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.377
There are three gunmen
in our news studio.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.683
INL News.

07:02.726 --> 07:03.814
Please hurry.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.337
Don't you dare take us off air.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.907
This is my son,

07:09.951 --> 07:12.040
Jackson.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.868
Jackson was six years old

07:13.911 --> 07:16.697
when a man walked into
his kindergarten classroom

07:16.740 --> 07:19.047
and shot him dead...

07:19.090 --> 07:21.136
along with 16 other children.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.748
They were not crisis actors.

07:25.749 --> 07:26.881
They were real kids!

07:28.143 --> 07:29.231
Gun!

07:35.280 --> 07:36.456
Come on!

07:36.499 --> 07:38.458
Back off or I'll shoot!

07:38.501 --> 07:40.242
Sit down!

07:40.285 --> 07:41.896
Nobody move!

08:22.327 --> 08:23.851
All right,
we got three hostages,

08:23.894 --> 08:25.548
one with a gunshot wound
to the chest.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.637
Reportedly, the gunman
is the father of a kid killed

08:27.681 --> 08:29.987
in a school shooting,
- possibly suicidal.
- INL

08:30.031 --> 08:31.336
Cable News.
They got that host,

08:31.380 --> 08:32.555
Tripp Hirsch,
pushes conspiracies

08:32.599 --> 08:33.991
about the Shaker
Elementary School shooting.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.428
- Been calling it a hoax.
- That's pretty twisted.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.083
The situation right now
- is no hoax.
- We got to get in there

08:39.127 --> 08:41.564
and deal with this before
a mass shooting airs on live TV.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.131
Let's roll.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.569
Is she okay?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
No, she
needs help. Please!

08:51.226 --> 08:52.227
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up!

08:53.271 --> 08:55.230
Shut up.
This is all your fault.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.448
Get this off air now!

08:58.407 --> 08:59.974
Deacon, Tan, let me know when
you've cleared the building.

09:00.017 --> 09:00.975
Roger.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.454
I didn't want
to hurt anyone.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.501
I just wanted you to stop
telling lies about my child.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.591
You know what
you've done to my family?

09:08.635 --> 09:10.506
The pain?

09:11.594 --> 09:13.553
Sounds like he might
turn the gun on himself.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.076
He might decide to kill
someone else first.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.387
This is the LAPD.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.911
Stop it right there.
Don't even think

09:23.954 --> 09:25.216
about going for that gun.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.957
Leave the hero
stuff to us, man.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.439
22-David in position.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.876
Got a shot lined up.
Gun's by his side.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.443
He's not aiming at anyone
right now.

09:34.486 --> 09:35.575
Yeah, then hold fire.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.881
Lies have consequences.

09:37.925 --> 09:38.969
I can talk him down.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.102
Chris, you try.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.582
She can play
the empathy card.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.410
But be quick, before this guy
loses it completely.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.151
Go, Chris, go.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.115
Hi, Robert.
My name is Chris.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.204
I'm an LAPD SWAT officer.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.249
I understand why you're upset.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.382
I would be, too,
in your situation.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.602
Will you tell me about your son?

10:03.690 --> 10:05.300
Jackson.

10:05.343 --> 10:08.042
Will you tell me about Jackson?

10:16.093 --> 10:17.921
Um...

10:17.965 --> 10:21.577
he, um, he wanted to be a...

10:21.621 --> 10:23.492
a pilot when he grew up.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.106
He loved pillow fights
and, uh...

10:29.150 --> 10:30.978
and Lego...

10:32.501 --> 10:35.330
...and, uh, he was
obsessed with sharks.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.942
He has a twin sister.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.422
Phoebe.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.948
I can't do this anymore!

10:44.992 --> 10:45.993
Don't.

10:46.036 --> 10:46.994
Phoebe needs her dad.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.257
Yeah? What kind of a dad am I?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.652
A dad who loves his kids
more than anything.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.654
Who'd do anything for them.

10:57.526 --> 11:00.660
I miss him so much.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.139
I know you do.

11:02.183 --> 11:05.012
I also lost someone
to gun violence.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.491
I still wonder what I...

11:06.535 --> 11:08.537
what I could have done
to save her.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.974
I still have moments
where I get so angry.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.410
But you know what?

11:12.454 --> 11:15.283
You die, who is gonna
keep fighting for the truth?

11:15.326 --> 11:17.633
Who is gonna fight
to keep Jackson's memory alive?

11:21.550 --> 11:23.334
Keep going, Chris. You're
getting through to him.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.684
Will you put down the gun?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.382
Let us help you
get the truth out.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.046
We're coming in now, okay?

11:40.569 --> 11:42.745
Get us back on air right now.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.052
Don't move.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.444
Put your hands
behind your back, Robert.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.593
Poor guy.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.290
He shot someone.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.640
EMTs said she's critical,
she might not make it.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.425
He shouldn't have shot her,
but can you imagine

12:10.468 --> 12:11.948
if someone killed Lila
or-or Matthew,

12:11.992 --> 12:14.298
and then you had to watch
some guy tell millions of people

12:14.342 --> 12:16.561
that it never happened,
that you were making it up?

12:16.605 --> 12:18.563
No. I can't imagine.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.392
But for someone to have lost
a child to gun violence,

12:21.436 --> 12:23.743
seems a pretty strange
way to make a point.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.441
The other two gunmen got
away before we showed up.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.051
Shot a security guard
on their way out.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.661
Luckily, they were nice enough

12:29.705 --> 12:31.663
to show us their faces.
RHD's working on ID'ing them

12:31.707 --> 12:33.491
- as we speak.
- One of them got shot in the arm.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.145
Yeah, I already put an alert out

12:35.189 --> 12:36.233
to the hospitals in the area.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.408
My guess is
they'll go to ground.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.758
What if the other
two are also parents

12:38.801 --> 12:40.324
of kids killed in shootings?
There's plenty

12:40.368 --> 12:41.456
of other talking heads out there

12:41.499 --> 12:42.805
spewing the same crap
as this guy.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.633
Could be they're planning
on hitting more targets.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.417
Liaise with RHD.
You can put together a list,

12:46.461 --> 12:47.462
and they can warn them.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.203
All right, I'll get on it.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.554
They're gonna need
police protection, too--

12:52.597 --> 12:54.121
at least until we
catch these guys.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.777
I told you a hundred times

12:57.820 --> 12:59.256
not to run that story.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.606
We called it a hoax
when we knew it wasn't!

13:01.650 --> 13:03.347
We called it an "alleged hoax."We knew

13:03.391 --> 13:04.827
it was an actual
school shooting.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.307
We knew children died!

13:06.350 --> 13:08.265
We reaped what we sowed today!

13:08.309 --> 13:09.571
Get off your soapbox, Tripp.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.268
You knew what this job was
when I gave it to you.

13:11.312 --> 13:14.402
You practically bit
my arm off to get it.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.838
And, good news--

13:15.882 --> 13:17.448
I've had three advertisers
call me

13:17.492 --> 13:19.407
in the last five minutes,

13:19.450 --> 13:21.322
including the CEO
of Tile Universe.

13:21.365 --> 13:24.325
Our drama this morning
probably saved your job,

13:24.368 --> 13:26.283
and the station
- from going under.
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.763
You... you let it air live?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.810
Of course. That SWAT
rescue was TV gold.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.116
I have everyone from CNN

13:33.160 --> 13:36.293
to the BBC clamoring
for the footage.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.599
We're gonna make a killing.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.167
I guess that's
one word for it.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.516
<i>Robert West,</i>

13:41.559 --> 13:43.518
the guy you arrested,
still in surgery.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.520
The other two
are still unaccounted for,

13:45.563 --> 13:48.479
but we managed to ID them
using facial recognition.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.134
Sam Dolnick.
Arnold Boseman.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.310
Once RHD finds them, they've
asked SWAT to bring them in.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.399
We warned a dozen
other potential targets--

13:55.443 --> 13:58.359
all news outlets, media
personalities in the L.A. area--

13:58.402 --> 14:00.317
and we offered them
- police protection.
- Well, Tripp Hirsch

14:00.361 --> 14:02.842
and his boss Jeffrey turned us
down-- said they handle

14:02.885 --> 14:05.496
- their security in-house.
- Well, hopefully not with
the same security guards

14:05.540 --> 14:07.498
who let three gunmen
breeze their way onto live TV.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.500
What do we know about them?

14:09.544 --> 14:10.675
Dolnick's daughter was killed

14:10.719 --> 14:12.503
in the same school shooting
as West's son.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.549
And like West, he
has no police record,

14:14.592 --> 14:16.029
no registered weapons.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.248
He campaigns for gun control,
if you can believe it.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.511
Now, Arnold Boseman's
the real surprise.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.383
He has two kids,
but they're both alive and well.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.428
Army vet-- he did
two tours in Iraq--

14:24.472 --> 14:26.169
and now runs an
IT consultancy.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.823
Who probably supplied
the fake security passes

14:27.867 --> 14:30.347
- they used to get in the studio.
His rap sheet's

14:30.391 --> 14:31.871
longer than my ex's list
of complaints

14:31.914 --> 14:34.177
- about me.
- Identity theft, fraud,

14:34.221 --> 14:36.179
aggravated assault
and criminal threat.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.920
Guy's a conspiracy
theorist nut.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.617
There's nothing he
doesn't believe.

14:39.661 --> 14:40.923
"Plandemic." Elvis lives.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.925
Lizard people are
controlling the world.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.406
His wife left him once he
fell down the rabbit hole

14:45.449 --> 14:46.798
and took the
kids with her.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.148
Up until two
months ago,

14:48.191 --> 14:51.325
Boseman's reposting
all of Tripp's videos online,

14:51.368 --> 14:52.935
the ones calling the
school shooting a fake,

14:52.979 --> 14:55.329
trolling families.
Then, all of a sudden,

14:55.372 --> 14:57.897
he does a total 180,
becomes the voice of reason.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.377
Starts posting videos
calling out Tripp and others

15:00.421 --> 15:02.336
for saying that the
shooting was a hoax.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.729
It's like a flat-earther
suddenly heading up NASA.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.384
So what happened two months ago
that changed his mind?

15:07.428 --> 15:09.386
This.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.649
Shaker Elementary
was not a fake shooting.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.955
It was real, people.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.696
How do I know this?

15:14.739 --> 15:16.524
Because I've been
to Shaker Hill.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.395
I've been to the school,
and the graveyard

15:18.439 --> 15:19.919
where those kids are buried.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.399
I've met the parents,
as well as the grandparents,

15:22.443 --> 15:23.923
the brothers and sisters.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.751
I've seen
the pictures and videos.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
You're being lied to--
not by them,

15:28.971 --> 15:30.538
but by people like Tripp Hirsch,

15:30.581 --> 15:32.714
who want you to believe
that it's all made up.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.672
And why are they lying to you?

15:34.716 --> 15:36.761
So they can make money
off of you.

15:36.805 --> 15:39.373
Must have met
- West and Dolnick.
- So this guy

15:39.416 --> 15:40.809
lost his kids,
but not in the same way.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.724
Not from a shooting,
but because he believed the lies

15:42.767 --> 15:44.247
that Tripp Hirsch
and the others were selling.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.466
That's why he's just as angry

15:45.509 --> 15:46.902
- at Tripp as the others.
- Enough to shoot him

15:46.946 --> 15:48.643
- on live TV?
- We need

15:48.686 --> 15:50.036
to bring Tripp Hirsch in

15:50.079 --> 15:51.646
and insist that he gets
real police protection.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.778
I'll try talking to him again.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.434
Definitely. There he is.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.827
Hey, Sanchez.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.916
What's up, fellas?
What's going on?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.396
We heard some gossip.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.311
Share. Cone of silence.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.921
- Swear.
- Okay, we heard that
you're planning

16:05.965 --> 16:08.837
to jump from SWAT
to the governor's detail.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.926
Where'd you hear that?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.015
Cone of silence.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.321
But we're here
to tell you

16:14.364 --> 16:15.626
that job will never be yours.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.801
- Why not?
- Because to win

16:16.845 --> 16:18.107
that promotion,

16:18.151 --> 16:19.717
you need to get Hondo
to leave SWAT, right?

16:19.761 --> 16:20.980
And Hondo's not going anywhere.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.894
So says you.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.809
All right, look,
this is a commission thing.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.811
I'm just a guy with a job
to do-- no hard feelings.

16:26.855 --> 16:27.987
Hondo's not a quitter.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.031
And if he doesn't quit,

16:29.075 --> 16:30.772
we're betting that
your pal Kosas

16:30.815 --> 16:32.992
won't put in that recommendation
call to the governor.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.866
You're good friends.
Hondo's lucky.

16:37.909 --> 16:41.609
But good friends would be trying
to convince him to leave,

16:41.652 --> 16:43.524
not encourage
- him to stay.
- How do you figure that?

16:43.567 --> 16:45.004
Because it's in
his best interest.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.831
Why stick around?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.398
What, he's gonna play
the rest of his days

16:48.442 --> 16:50.835
on SWAT taking orders
from younger guys?

16:50.879 --> 16:53.360
Come on, why sign up
for that humiliation?

16:53.403 --> 16:54.491
I sure wouldn't.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.710
Well, not everyone
thinks like you.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.016
Yeah, Hondo doesn't care

16:57.059 --> 16:58.582
whether he's
a team leader or not.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.497
Oh, well, that's lucky.
'Cause the higher-ups

17:00.541 --> 17:02.673
are never gonna reinstate him.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.023
Excuse me.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.853
- Okay, what now?
- We're gonna need

17:08.897 --> 17:10.681
a bigger carrot to tempt him.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.031
Something better
than the governor's detail.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.336
How are we gonna
manage that?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.338
This guy's obsessed
with rubbing shoulders

17:15.382 --> 17:17.601
with the rich and powerful.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.560
I might have an idea.

17:19.603 --> 17:20.865
Hospital just rang.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.433
Our gunman, Robert West,
just got out of surgery.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.087
Deacon, take Chris
and go talk to him

17:25.131 --> 17:26.741
before he gets booked
into county.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.004
See if he can tell us where his
partners might be holing up

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
and what they're planning next.

17:35.706 --> 17:39.014
Are you taking
me to jail?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.668
No.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.018
But I'm... I'm
going to jail.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.716
I didn't mean
to shoot her.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.501
Do you-do you know
if she's okay?

17:47.544 --> 17:49.764
The doctors
won't tell me anything.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.070
She's out of surgery.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.593
Doctors just told us
she's gonna pull through.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.380
The gun wasn't supposed
to be loaded.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.688
I swear, I had no idea.
We were only there

18:00.731 --> 18:02.951
so we could speak
directly to the viewers,

18:02.994 --> 18:05.432
have a chance to tell
our side of the story.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.737
And yeah,

18:06.781 --> 18:08.826
okay, if I'm being honest,

18:08.870 --> 18:10.567
I wanted Tripp to feel

18:10.611 --> 18:13.004
a fraction of the fear
my kid must have felt

18:13.048 --> 18:14.876
seconds before he died.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.705
But I wasn't
gonna hurt anyone.

18:17.748 --> 18:18.923
I hate guns.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.925
I didn't even want to use them,

18:20.969 --> 18:23.406
but, uh, Arnold said
they were just props,

18:23.450 --> 18:26.627
and-and they were the only way
to keep the cameras rolling.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.020
Do you think Arnold loaded
- the guns without telling you?
- He must have.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.631
Sam and I-- neither one of us

18:30.674 --> 18:32.937
even held a gun
before this morning.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.157
You think he planned
to kill Tripp on live TV?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.681
What? Wait, wait,

18:37.725 --> 18:39.466
is that what you think
we were planning?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.120
No, no, no, no, no.
I wasn't gonna kill anyone.

18:41.163 --> 18:45.167
I just wanted them to know
that my son's death was real.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.430
What do you think Arnold
is planning next?

18:47.474 --> 18:49.432
He ever mention targeting
anyone besides Tripp?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.565
He was always ranting
about different people.

18:51.608 --> 18:54.568
I mean, he-he called Tripp a...

18:54.611 --> 18:57.614
mouthpiece for the larger
conspiracy theory machine.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.877
Oh... my God.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.576
I can't go to prison.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.186
I have a kid.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.189
My wife, she's not
well enough to work.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.582
I need to take care of them.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.757
Maybe a judge will
take into consideration

19:09.800 --> 19:11.585
how much stress
you were under.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.804
And if you help us find
Sam and Arnold,

19:13.848 --> 19:16.459
we'll talk to the court,
tell 'em you cooperated.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.461
I just don't know
where they are.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.897
We're from out of state.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.943
I stayed with my sister
in Pasadena.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.988
Sam and Arnold,
they-they stayed in a motel.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.207
Do you know the name?

19:25.251 --> 19:29.472
They... they said
it was, uh, by the 101.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.693
He was complaining about
the-the traffic noise.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.825
And Arnold...
Arnold said that,

19:34.869 --> 19:36.827
uh, he could
see the Hollywood sign.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.485
Now, we got two motels
that fit the bill.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.532
Going through the guest
registers now.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.883
Okay, nothing in either
of their names.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.972
Assume they used
a fake ID.

19:51.015 --> 19:52.756
Hold up, go back.
Max Bane.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.195
That's a character from <i>
The Dragons of Teledor.</i>

19:56.238 --> 19:57.805
It's a series
of graphic novels.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.110
I was really
into 'em as a kid.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.548
Arnold was wearing
a Dragons of Teledor T-shirt

20:01.591 --> 20:03.114
in that video he posted.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.856
Yeah, I'm not sure I understood
any of that, but get going.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.257
It's Sam Dolnick.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.085
- He's alive.
Clear.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.740
24-David,

20:19.783 --> 20:21.524
we've got one suspect
unconscious, breathing.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.657
Need and R/A. And one suspect
gone on arrival.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.709
Hey. Second suspect's
still unconscious,

20:32.753 --> 20:34.798
so he can't tell us
where Arnold was headed.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.235
I got Tan and Street
working with RHD

20:36.278 --> 20:37.714
trying to find him.
As soon as they do

20:37.758 --> 20:39.716
- we're rolling out.
- Copy that.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.935
Tripp and his
producer Jeffrey

20:40.978 --> 20:42.545
turned down police
protection again.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.199
They seem to think the stunt
this morning was a one-off.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.201
Yeah, well, saves
the taxpayers, I guess.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.769
Hey, hold up, hold up.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.554
Question.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.339
Given any thought
to life beyond SWAT?

20:54.601 --> 20:56.211
No, can't say that I have.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.082
All right, straight up.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.824
I'm trying real hard
to do you a favor here.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.304
Is that what we're
calling it now?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.132
There are ways to
get ahead in this game.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.830
Shake the right hands,
you pat the right back.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.136
You get to keep rolling the dice

21:08.179 --> 21:09.659
and moving on up the ladder.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.835
You played by your own rules.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.010
You know,
you broke the blue code

21:13.054 --> 21:14.229
by going public
with family business,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.318
and you lost.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.667
The Commission's gonna
make your life miserable.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.843
I'm just the start.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.367
So take early retirement.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.194
Get a nice little security gig.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.196
You know, as much as I'd love
to stay here and listen

21:25.240 --> 21:27.677
to your career advice,

21:27.721 --> 21:28.678
I got somewhere to be.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.724
Hond...

21:33.074 --> 21:34.771
People have a right
to defend themselves.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.338
The best way to stop
a bad guy with a gun

21:36.382 --> 21:37.774
is a good guy with a gun.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.081
Annie says it's playing
on every channel.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.344
The whole "good guy with a gun"
argument makes me mad.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.346
I mean, look what happened
to that woman Andrea.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.087
She tried to take on
a bad guy with a gun,

21:46.130 --> 21:47.306
and got a bullet
through her chest.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.220
She'll probably be eating
through a tube

21:49.264 --> 21:50.265
for the rest of her life.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.354
Yeah, and if she
hadn't been armed

21:52.398 --> 21:53.703
and taken that shot,

21:53.747 --> 21:56.010
Arnold might have killed
everyone in that studio.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.187
What are you doing here?

21:59.230 --> 22:01.189
Well, you didn't respond
to my messages.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.973
I'm busy hunting down
two active shooters.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.061
Well, I came
all the way down here

22:04.105 --> 22:06.281
just to speak to you.
Uh, do you mind?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.501
You good?

22:11.286 --> 22:12.766
I wanted to know
if you'd be interested

22:12.809 --> 22:14.245
in coming on the show
this afternoon.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.378
Our viewers are big, big fans,

22:16.422 --> 22:18.902
and you got yourself quite
a following already.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.470
♪HotSwatCop.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.080
You know, people want
to know more

22:23.124 --> 22:25.082
about the officer
who saved our butts.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.170
I didn't do it alone.

22:26.214 --> 22:28.390
Yeah, but you're a woman.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.827
People like that.
It's different.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.742
You look great
in that uniform, too.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.309
You should really move

22:34.353 --> 22:36.746
these five minutes of fame
into something.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.096
I mean, these opportunities
don't come around too often.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.576
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

22:40.620 --> 22:43.144
I think you'd make a perfect
spokesperson for gun rights.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.189
People want to hear
from law enforcement.

22:45.233 --> 22:46.582
Most cops believe
in the second amendment,

22:46.626 --> 22:49.193
but they also believe in
sensible gun control laws.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.760
- You want to know why?
- Mm.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.414
'Cause a lot of the times
those guns are aimed at us.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.111
Well, come on the show
and talk about that, then.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.200
You've got a point of view.
People want to hear it.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.246
All you're doing is
stirring things up,

22:58.289 --> 23:01.075
selling fake outrage
- to make a quick buck.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.077
A lot of people
think differently.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.994
You know, they want to see us
challenge the status quo and... And what--

23:07.037 --> 23:08.474
shoot each other on live TV?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.781
You're lucky no one died today.

23:11.825 --> 23:15.002
I can see that you're
a little emotional right now,

23:15.045 --> 23:17.483
so here's my card...

23:17.526 --> 23:20.268
in case you change your mind.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.406
I think that...

23:27.449 --> 23:29.320
Oh, excuse me.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.454
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.890
I got your message.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.501
Sorry to pull you away
- from work.
- No, you didn't.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.807
I'm on call.
What's going on?

23:37.851 --> 23:39.330
I wanted you to meet
some folks.

23:39.374 --> 23:42.072
Okay. Who?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.378
Some community activists.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.467
Come on, they won't bite.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.469
- They really want to meet you.
- Babe, I'm in uniform.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.079
They know the LAPD's
dropping by?

23:49.123 --> 23:50.820
They read about you
in the paper.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.475
What you did--
speaking truth to power--

23:53.519 --> 23:55.303
That counts for something
in their book.

23:55.346 --> 23:58.828
You've earned their trust
and you have their ear.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.830
Now give them yours.

24:00.874 --> 24:04.181
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.357
<i>How are we gonna
get Sanchez out?</i>

24:06.401 --> 24:08.185
I talked to Street. We couldn't
come up with anything.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.622
No, we got it handled,
don't worry.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.275
Deacon here has come up
with the perfect solution.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.321
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, let's keep
the champagne on ice.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.323
All right?
It's not exactly a done deal.

24:15.366 --> 24:18.195
- What's not a done deal?
- See ya.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.589
Deacon here was
telling me about

24:20.633 --> 24:21.982
this sweet gig that
just came to him

24:22.025 --> 24:22.983
through his
security company.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.898
Yeah. A high-profile client

24:24.941 --> 24:25.986
needs a new head
of security.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.117
Cool. You tell Hondo?

24:27.161 --> 24:28.467
This sounds perfect for him.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.991
Look, we know the governor's
detail sounds good,

24:31.034 --> 24:32.906
but working as head
of security for Arthur Meeks

24:32.949 --> 24:34.429
is way frigging cooler.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.865
Who's he?
I've never heard of him.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.214
Oh, he's he head of the biggest
studio in Hollywood.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.738
He's richer than God.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.522
They guy lives in a mansion
in the Pacific Palisades.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.872
Throws these insane parties

24:42.916 --> 24:43.873
with all the A-listers.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.135
I mean, it's so exclusive,

24:45.179 --> 24:46.528
even Brad Pitt has to
beg for an invite.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.269
Hosts a ton
of fundraisers, too.

24:48.312 --> 24:50.097
- Yeah.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.533
ex-presidents,
current presidents,

24:51.577 --> 24:53.317
governors,
tech moguls.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.362
I'm not sure it's for me.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.146
It's great pay, too.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.322
And the benefits?
They're insane.

24:58.366 --> 25:01.021
If you're interested,
you just let me know.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.023
Job's yours.

25:03.066 --> 25:06.461
Nah, see, my ex-wife just moved
to Sacramento with the kids.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.073
The governor's based there,
so I can be close to them.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.946
But thanks for thinking of me.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.297
No problem.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.996
Been through it twice already.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.086
There's no car rentals under
Arnold Boseman or Max Bane.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.349
Maybe he's just
- taking Ubers?
- All right, give me a minute.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.264
I'm running a search using
all the character names

25:27.308 --> 25:29.179
from <i>The Dragons of Teledor.
You never know.</i>

25:32.313 --> 25:34.663
Hey, I heard about
your mom's funeral.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.447
You got all the
arrangements sorted?

25:36.491 --> 25:37.579
I don't know.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.103
I wrote a eulogy,
but what's the point

25:40.147 --> 25:41.670
of reading it to
a bunch of empty chairs?

25:43.237 --> 25:46.283
She wasn't exactly religious,
so prayers are out.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.590
I guess I'll just play
"Summer of '69".

25:48.634 --> 25:50.287
She loved Bryan Adams,

25:50.331 --> 25:52.986
and let's just leave it at that.

25:53.029 --> 25:56.380
My dad's funeral was this
huge Chinese affair.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.209
The wake lasted three days.
The whole community showed up.

25:59.253 --> 26:02.038
And I remember wishing that
everyone would just leave.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.432
It was too many people,
too public.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.477
And there was no room
for my brother and my mom

26:06.521 --> 26:07.522
and me to grieve.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.568
I guess there's just
no good stories

26:09.611 --> 26:11.091
when it comes to saying
goodbye.

26:12.266 --> 26:15.182
Yeah. There were some
pretty cool traditions, though.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.705
You burn all these
different things.

26:16.749 --> 26:20.056
Uh, incense and candles,
but also fake paper money,

26:20.100 --> 26:22.319
fake paper cars, houses.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.320
Even fake paper sushi.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.844
- Why?
- So the person who died

26:24.887 --> 26:28.108
has everything they need to
be happy in the afterlife.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.979
They make fake paper pills
and bottles of whiskey?

26:30.023 --> 26:32.329
My mom would dig that.
Kidding.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.070
Not really kidding.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.073
Bingo.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.727
Vigo White.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.034
That's the slayer character
from <i>The Dragons of Teledor.</i>

26:41.077 --> 26:43.166
Booked an economy sedan
two days ago

26:43.210 --> 26:44.254
from an Enterprise downtown.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.169
They'll have a
tracker in the car.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.699
Thank you.
It was nice talking to you.

26:53.742 --> 26:56.223
- Take care.
- You too.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.533
Can't believe you did this.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.187
Can't believe good,

27:04.231 --> 27:07.190
or "can't believe you threw me
to the wolves like that" bad?

27:07.234 --> 27:08.539
I wouldn't call them wolves.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.280
More like pussycats.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.369
- So it was helpful?
- Yeah.

27:12.413 --> 27:13.719
There were some good ideas.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.938
Sha'Ron was telling me
about a pretty cool project

27:15.982 --> 27:17.940
where volunteers respond
to minor trouble

27:17.984 --> 27:19.202
in the neighborhood
so that the police

27:19.246 --> 27:20.421
don't become the first call.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.249
Reduces tensions between
locals and the cops.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.772
I heard of a group in Oregon

27:23.816 --> 27:25.687
doing something similar
with mental health call-outs,

27:25.731 --> 27:27.950
using volunteers to
de-escalate situations

27:27.994 --> 27:29.865
- police are usually called to.
- Yeah, I heard that, too.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.693
Maybe you can set up
something like that in L.A.,

27:31.737 --> 27:33.129
trial it.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.696
I don't have the pull in the
department like I used to.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.219
It's kind of the opposite,
actually.

27:36.263 --> 27:39.222
So? Partner with some of
the people you met today.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.485
I'm sure they can
make it happen.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.227
Maybe I can't push the LAPD
to change right now,

27:44.271 --> 27:46.273
but it doesn't mean I can't
push for change outside of it.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.754
There you go.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.931
- Wait. You hear that?
- What?

27:51.974 --> 27:54.585
Sounds like you finding
some purpose.

27:56.762 --> 27:57.893
I think I do hear
a little something.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.243
You know, you might just find

28:00.287 --> 28:02.637
You can do more outside
of SWAT than in it.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.995
I love you.

28:13.039 --> 28:16.390
I didn't mean
to spring that on you.

28:18.044 --> 28:21.482
I've been thinking that
for a while.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.571
I just thought maybe
I'd finally try and say it.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.358
I love you, too.

28:36.932 --> 28:39.718
- Perfect timing.
- Are you kidding?

28:42.459 --> 28:45.811
Duty calls.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.682
See you tonight.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.857
Okay.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.296
Hey.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.907
Be careful.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.692
Always am.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.096
Excuse me. Hi.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.925
Uh, it's members only.
Can I see your ID, please?

29:12.968 --> 29:14.622
I'm not a member.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.364
I'm trying to find someone.
It's urgent.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.800
Okay. If you let me
know their name,

29:18.844 --> 29:20.367
I can page them for you.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.803
Just give me a minute
to deal with this client.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.587
Sorry about that,
Mr. Underhill.

29:23.631 --> 29:24.675
I will make a note and...

29:32.988 --> 29:35.251
What are you doing here?

29:35.295 --> 29:37.732
The security guard
let me in.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.647
I wanted to hand this
to you in person.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.824
Tried to do it earlier,
but you've been avoiding me.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.392
I quit, effective immediately.

29:48.395 --> 29:49.962
You have a contract.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.615
- I don't care.
- Really?

29:51.659 --> 29:54.444
Didn't you just buy a house
on the west side?

29:54.488 --> 29:56.446
And what about those
child support payments

29:56.490 --> 29:57.491
you're always bitching about?

29:57.534 --> 29:59.536
People almost died today,

29:59.580 --> 30:01.712
and you're here,
working on your backhand?

30:01.756 --> 30:03.714
Do I look like the type of guy
who plays tennis?

30:03.758 --> 30:07.022
I'm here to cut a deal
with the CEO of Tile Universe.

30:07.066 --> 30:10.939
They want to buy
$600,000 worth of advertising

30:10.983 --> 30:12.549
on your show.

30:12.593 --> 30:16.031
This is the only place
- their CEO does business.
- Too bad.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.164
Tell him there isn't gonna
be a show to advertise on.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.645
What are you gonna do?

30:21.689 --> 30:24.866
Anchor the evening news?

30:24.910 --> 30:28.174
Hate to break it to you,
but that ship has sailed.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.835
The future isn't news.

30:41.448 --> 30:42.884
<i>Jeffrey Aimsbury
went to a meeting</i>

30:42.928 --> 30:44.538
<i>at the Toluca Country Club.</i>

30:44.581 --> 30:46.583
<i>Just got a report
of a possible shooter there.</i>

30:46.627 --> 30:48.020
We got to get this
place evacuated.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.586
That's his car back there.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.632
20-David to Command.
Affirmative on the car.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.155
There's someone with a gun!

30:53.199 --> 30:55.897
Go. Go!
Hondo, call for backup,

30:55.941 --> 30:58.030
then stay here and get
everyone evacuated safely.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.773
This is 27-David
requesting backup.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.863
We've got an armed suspect
at the Toluca Country Club.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.125
Doing evacs now.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.170
Let's go. Move, move.
Off the property. Go!

31:09.955 --> 31:11.870
Go. Go!

31:14.829 --> 31:16.091
There's someone in the building
with a gun.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.963
Move! Get out! Move. Go.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.662
Okay, move. Get out of here.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.194
Let's go, let's go, move.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.543
Get off the property.
Get to the exits.

31:33.587 --> 31:35.197
Go! Go!

31:35.241 --> 31:37.678
Keep moving. Go!

31:37.721 --> 31:40.159
Help me, please help me!

31:45.686 --> 31:48.819
We have an active shooter.
Move! Go! Let's go!

32:03.008 --> 32:05.532
- LAPD! Stop!
- LAPD!

32:05.575 --> 32:07.751
Out this way! Out that way!
Come on!

32:27.032 --> 32:29.599
You really think you can hide?

32:29.643 --> 32:31.601
Think I'd give up that easy?

32:42.699 --> 32:43.962
Locked.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.835
Chris.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.060
There you are.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.343
You okay?

33:20.085 --> 33:21.564
Not really.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.218
You did your job.

33:25.090 --> 33:28.702
Oh, please tell me
he's not coming over here.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.051
He's coming

33:30.095 --> 33:31.096
over here.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.576
Twice in one day
you saved my life.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.274
I was wondering if
you'd given any thought

33:35.317 --> 33:37.058
to what we talked about earlier.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.974
She didn't happen to
give you my card, did she?

33:40.018 --> 33:43.064
- You'd look great on TV.
- Read the room.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.937
Oh, and by the way,
next time someone

33:46.981 --> 33:48.330
offers you police protection--

33:48.374 --> 33:51.812
and I'm betting there
will be a next time-- take it.

33:53.292 --> 33:56.599
Excuse me, can I talk to you
just for one minute?

33:56.643 --> 33:58.253
I'm sorry.

33:58.297 --> 34:01.169
I handed in my resignation.
I'm-I'm done.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.954
Right. So the arsonist
lights a fire,

34:03.998 --> 34:05.695
and the fire almost kills him,

34:05.739 --> 34:07.088
and then he realizes
maybe playing with matches

34:07.132 --> 34:08.394
was a stupid idea.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.961
I'm gonna do what I can
to-to make things right.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.093
Starting with-with...

34:12.137 --> 34:14.313
telling the truth.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.967
You know it's too late
for that, right?

34:17.011 --> 34:18.317
No one's putting
this fire out.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.971
We just wait now,
for the next spark,

34:21.015 --> 34:22.625
the next fire.

34:22.669 --> 34:26.281
The difference is you have to
live with that now, too.

34:26.325 --> 34:29.023
Same way we do.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.392
- Hey, Sanchez.
- What's up?

34:50.436 --> 34:52.133
What's this I keep hearing
about some anthrax threat

34:52.177 --> 34:54.092
- at the mayor's office?
- It's nothing, man.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.311
It was just lucky I was there
and spotted something off.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.139
The envelope had about a dozen
stamps on it,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.098
address looked like it had
been written by a toddler.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.102
If I have to hear that
anthrax story one more time...

35:04.145 --> 35:06.321
What anthrax story?

35:06.365 --> 35:07.670
You really haven't heard it?

35:07.714 --> 35:09.672
Sanchez?

35:09.716 --> 35:11.326
He's like one of
those talking dolls

35:11.370 --> 35:13.023
people keep pulling the string.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.417
He won't shut up about how
he saved the mayor's life.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.245
Hold up a sec.
He's saying he's the one

35:17.289 --> 35:18.681
who found that envelope
and stopped the mayor

35:18.725 --> 35:21.075
- from opening it?
- Yeah, like he deserves a medal.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.337
No, if there's a medal,
it should be going

35:22.381 --> 35:23.686
to the mayor's secretary.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.123
It was Angie
who found that envelope

35:25.166 --> 35:26.689
- and warned security.
- Hold on.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.865
You're telling me that
Sanchez is taking credit

35:28.909 --> 35:30.171
for something
he didn't really do?

35:30.215 --> 35:32.042
Yeah.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.135
Just the man.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.789
I got a proposal for you.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.836
Deac was telling me about
this high-profile job

35:42.879 --> 35:44.751
that you would be perfect for.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.883
Head of security
for Arthur Meeks.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.146
Studio boss.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.324
Sanchez, you still
ain't getting it,

35:52.367 --> 35:54.195
so I'm gonna spell it out
for you.

35:54.239 --> 35:57.372
I'm not quitting.
Not now. Not ever.

35:57.416 --> 36:00.201
So you can keep sidelining me
on missions, and writing me up

36:00.245 --> 36:01.898
for insubordination,
whether it's true or not,

36:01.942 --> 36:02.943
whatever.

36:02.986 --> 36:05.163
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Really?

36:05.206 --> 36:09.079
What if I pull you
from all the action,

36:09.123 --> 36:11.212
give you substandard
evaluations

36:11.256 --> 36:14.128
and force you to fetch
and carry like the team mule

36:14.172 --> 36:15.825
for the rest of your days?

36:15.869 --> 36:18.306
Go ahead.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.309
I'll keep doing my job,
no complaints.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.268
If the brass want me out,
they're gonna have to fire me

36:23.311 --> 36:25.226
because I am not resigning.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.923
You know why?

36:26.967 --> 36:30.013
Because climbing that greasy
pole is your sport, not mine.

36:37.238 --> 36:40.241
If I quit, any other cop
out there thinking about

36:40.285 --> 36:42.765
calling out the bosses
will know I got forced out.

36:42.809 --> 36:45.942
Because doing the right thing
is about dignity,

36:45.986 --> 36:47.509
not some payoff.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.172
Wherever I turn,
there you lurk.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.218
We're your
teammates.

37:00.261 --> 37:01.567
You always got to
watch your six.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.786
Given any more thought
to the head of security job?

37:03.830 --> 37:06.267
- Clock's ticking.
- I told you I'm not interested.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.487
I hear the clock's ticking on
that governor's detail job, too.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.967
Someone sent anthrax
to the mayor in the mail,

37:11.011 --> 37:12.534
but thanks to
a certain somebody,

37:12.578 --> 37:14.319
the mayor never
opened that envelope.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.146
You want to know
who saved the day?

37:16.190 --> 37:19.889
It was the mayor's secretary.
Believe that?

37:19.933 --> 37:22.152
How many people you been
telling that fake story to?

37:22.196 --> 37:23.415
Enough to get a
reporter interested

37:23.458 --> 37:24.981
in writing it up, maybe.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.069
I don't think
the governor's office

37:26.113 --> 37:27.854
would be too excited
about that.

37:27.897 --> 37:29.377
It's gonna be interesting to
see how this all plays out,

37:29.421 --> 37:30.987
isn't it, Sanchez?

37:31.031 --> 37:33.163
I hope you got a soft landing
a year from now

37:33.207 --> 37:35.818
when Hondo's still here
and the Commission's wondering

37:35.862 --> 37:37.255
why you haven't been able
to get him out.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.088
So, this job for, uh,

37:45.132 --> 37:46.307
Arthur Meeks.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.353
The studio guy.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.007
Yeah. But what about, uh,
Sacramento and the-the kids?

37:51.051 --> 37:54.228
Aw, they'll be off
to college soon anyway.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.838
And they'll probably be
way more impressed with this

37:55.882 --> 37:58.014
than me hanging
with the governor.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.976
- Job come with benefits?
- Yep.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.545
That paycheck, plus
early police pension,

38:06.588 --> 38:08.111
it'd be like double dipping.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.375
Yeah.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.076
All right, so what
if I'm interested?

38:16.119 --> 38:20.080
Listen up, everyone.
I've got some news.

38:20.123 --> 38:23.866
Sanchez has informed me that
he's packing up his SWAT bags

38:23.910 --> 38:26.347
and moving on to brighter skies.
I want to thank him

38:26.391 --> 38:28.480
for leading the team
the last couple of months.

38:28.523 --> 38:30.960
He's done a stellar job.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.266
Good job, Sanchez.

38:36.575 --> 38:39.578
I know you'll want to know who's
taking over as team leader,

38:39.621 --> 38:41.362
and usually these things
take some time,

38:41.406 --> 38:43.321
require approvals.

38:43.364 --> 38:48.238
But the decision was easy,
so it's already been made.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.415
Hondo's back in the saddle.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.025
Hey, that's awesome.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.635
Band is back together, yeah!

38:55.420 --> 38:58.379
- Now we can pop the champagne.
- What just happened?

38:58.423 --> 38:59.989
Come on.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.514
Commander.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.950
How'd you get the
brass to approve?

39:03.993 --> 39:06.169
You ever heard
the expression

39:06.213 --> 39:07.910
"Don't ask permission,
ask forgiveness"?

39:07.954 --> 39:10.391
- Yeah.
- Well, I didn't do either.

39:10.435 --> 39:13.089
I'm tired of the brass
interfering with my teams.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.308
Wait, sir.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.918
You sure you're not
gonna get in trouble?

39:15.962 --> 39:18.356
Well, at least their anger
will be directed at me now

39:18.399 --> 39:19.487
instead of you.

39:21.010 --> 39:24.231
You stuck your neck
out for me once.

39:24.274 --> 39:27.452
I'm just sorry I didn't
return the favor sooner.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.069
I cede to the better man.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.207
I got to say, Hondo,
I have never seen anyone

39:44.251 --> 39:45.513
with a more loyal team.

39:45.557 --> 39:48.429
They were always looking
over my shoulder to you.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.997
It was kind of annoying.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.694
Good luck on the next job.

39:52.738 --> 39:55.567
Yeah, I have a feeling
I'm gonna do just fine.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.961
I'm sure you are.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.354
I'd say see you around,
but I'm heading to Shanghai

40:00.398 --> 40:02.356
in a few days for a premiere.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.140
I'd also say

40:04.184 --> 40:07.361
keep your head down
in the future.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.624
But I have a feeling
that advice

40:09.668 --> 40:11.234
would fall on deaf ears.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.335
Hey, Street, wait up.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.164
- What's this?
- I told my mom
about the funeral.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.645
She went to Chinatown and
picked up a few things for you.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.125
That's really sweet of her.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.562
What is this, like,
- a fake gold bar?
- Yeah.

40:34.606 --> 40:37.217
Some money, incense,
paper cell phone.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.480
Man, my mom would love all this.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.395
It's perfect, man.
Thank you.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.702
And here.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.401
Thank you.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.229
Is it okay
if we come with you?

40:49.272 --> 40:50.709
Yeah.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.145
I mean, I would have
invited you guys,

40:52.188 --> 40:53.407
I just didn't think
you'd want to come.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.496
Of course we want to come
to be there for you.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.411
Yeah, and now you have
a chance to read that eulogy.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.241
You guys, too?

41:01.284 --> 41:03.635
- Are you kidding? Yeah.
- Of course.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.550
Can't have you playing
Bryan Adams to an empty room.

41:06.681 --> 41:10.772
We'll ride together.
Come on, kid.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.035
Thanks, you guys.
