WEBVTT

00:37.537 --> 00:41.374
You wouldn't want to get in trouble
either, would you?

01:16.618 --> 01:19.621
Wow, amazing.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.041
I'm checking
the compatibility of different breeds.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.126
- Compatibility?
- Yes.

01:25.835 --> 01:29.631
If round-bodied goldfish that swim calmly
are put together with livelier fish,

01:29.714 --> 01:32.008
they may be bullied.
So I should be careful.

01:41.684 --> 01:42.936
Let's separate them.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.823
Goldfish aren't able
to escape on their own.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.290
I'm glad you're safe.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.631
Ready.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.011
Nori.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.514
Today, I'll be bringing home
my junior colleague, Tsuta.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.517
- What?
- I told you before, remember?

03:04.601 --> 03:05.435
That thing.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.814
- But wait, I haven't--
- Nori!

03:10.356 --> 03:13.067
It's the only thing we can do now!

03:15.194 --> 03:16.070
Right?

03:26.164 --> 03:29.667
How nice, having such a well-made lunch
made for you every day.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.753
Want some?

03:33.129 --> 03:33.963
May I?

03:34.047 --> 03:37.967
Yeah, just this once.
Try the Spanish mackerel.

03:38.051 --> 03:38.885
Thank you!

03:38.968 --> 03:40.303
DEEP-FRIED MINCED MEAT

03:40.386 --> 03:41.679
YAKISOBA SANDWICH

03:44.641 --> 03:45.767
Delicious.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.645
Your wife really is a good cook.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.860
Tell me, Tsuta.

03:56.819 --> 03:57.654
Yes?

03:59.489 --> 04:02.450
You wanna fuck my wife?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.207
What are you talking about?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.004
What?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.764
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.183
- Thank you.
- Here, I'll do it.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.605
I'll help you with the store.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.107
What?

04:34.649 --> 04:37.944
It's my fault you're hurt.
I'll do anything you say.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.904
But if someone comes…

04:39.988 --> 04:41.030
It's fine.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.075
You've taken care of me.
I want to repay you.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.247
You don't need to do that.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.208
Hello!

04:52.834 --> 04:55.295
- Ran.
- How are you, big brother?

04:58.756 --> 04:59.882
This is my younger sister.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.727
- She's my--
- I'm Sakura Hiraga. I work here part-time.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.521
I'm quite indebted to the manager.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.023
Nice to meet you.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.399
Seriously?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.651
You can afford to hire someone?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.654
I told you not to come here.
Mom won't like it.

05:21.738 --> 05:25.867
It's fine. I was worried about you
and came to see how you were doing,

05:25.950 --> 05:28.453
thinking your goldfish store
might have closed down.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.330
Don't worry. I'm doing fine.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.416
Glad to hear that.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.435
We've been married for eight years.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.188
We want kids soon,

05:55.980 --> 05:58.316
but we just can't get in the mood.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.236
That's why you thought
you might be aroused

06:02.320 --> 06:05.156
by seeing your wife
in the arms of another?

06:05.823 --> 06:06.657
Yeah.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.410
Why me?

06:09.494 --> 06:12.747
You're the only one in our section
that's single and has no girlfriends?

06:12.830 --> 06:15.291
I'm asking you.
Come on, I'm begging you, Tsuta.

06:15.374 --> 06:16.667
I can't.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.878
Your wife doesn't want to either,
does she?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.422
My wife wants kids too.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.966
This would be for my wife as well.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.510
What you're saying is crazy.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.053
Please.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.681
Help my wife and me
get through this crisis. Please!

06:33.768 --> 06:35.895
I'll have to hear what your wife thinks.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.689
Tsuta!

06:45.279 --> 06:48.741
Amazing! This place is huge.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.702
Hey, Tsuta, did you know?

06:51.786 --> 06:52.995
What?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.748
Why the human cock
is shaped the way it is?

06:57.625 --> 06:58.501
What?

07:01.045 --> 07:03.381
That unique shape is…

07:03.464 --> 07:04.507
Please stop.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.886
To scrape out other men's sperm.

07:10.513 --> 07:15.184
In order to efficiently scrape out
the sperm that ejaculated earlier…

07:18.563 --> 07:20.565
it evolved into that shape.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.985
Correct!

07:51.304 --> 07:52.180
Delicious.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.145
Every dish is delicious.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.732
I can get you more.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.318
- Thank you.
- Okay.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.071
How nice!

08:09.739 --> 08:11.949
- What?
- Do you remember?

08:12.033 --> 08:16.120
We went out to eat eel together
on the company family trip, right?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.246
Yeah.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.500
And your order was the only one
that was forgotten.

08:21.042 --> 08:25.254
Noriko shared her half-eaten
grilled eel on rice with you.

08:27.590 --> 08:32.053
My wife sharing her own
grilled eel on rice with another man.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.934
That made me so incredibly excited.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.815
That night we really went at it in bed.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.610
Dear.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.281
So, why don't you two hold hands?

08:53.032 --> 08:53.866
What?

08:55.117 --> 08:55.993
What?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.579
That's not a big deal, is it?
You don't like Noriko?

08:58.663 --> 09:01.123
- It's not that, but--
- Then, go ahead.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.417
Noriko, go ahead.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.064
I see.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.775
I got a bit pissed off just now.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.695
- I'm sorry!
- No, it's fine.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.240
Now, hold hands like lovers.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.200
No, I can't do that!

09:36.284 --> 09:37.368
It'll be fine.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.286
Noriko.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.621
Go ahead.

09:45.668 --> 09:49.005
- Like this?
- Yeah, just like that.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.967
Good. Now…

09:53.634 --> 09:55.094
Next, kiss.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.682
Go ahead, kiss.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.809
Go ahead.

10:14.488 --> 10:15.531
Let's stop.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.076
You're too drunk.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.245
Okay, I got it.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.998
- I'll leave you two alone for a moment.
- What?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.666
The mood is important for this.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.544
- No, you'll be fine.
- Dear!

10:46.103 --> 10:48.773
I'm going home now.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.360
No, please stay. My husband will…

10:57.323 --> 11:02.912
If you're not comfortable with this,
don't you think you should say something?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.045
He just doesn't listen to people.

11:12.088 --> 11:16.008
In college, he was my senior,

11:16.634 --> 11:18.844
and every time we met, he'd say,

11:18.928 --> 11:21.597
"I love you.
I'll die if you don't go out with me."

11:21.680 --> 11:23.432
He was so persistent.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.600
That sounds like him.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.564
Try this one too, if you like.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.608
Thank you.

11:43.911 --> 11:44.870
Delicious!

11:58.134 --> 11:59.260
The thing is…

12:02.304 --> 12:05.683
I thought I'd never meet someone

12:06.183 --> 12:08.185
who needed me like that.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.524
I'm rather plain,
with no redeeming qualities.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.278
That's not true.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.114
You can cook these delicious dishes.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.493
The lunch you make him
always look so delicious.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.289
And I'm always envious of him.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.545
I'm glad to hear that.
Thank you for your kind words.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.297
No, seriously.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.259
I think you're lovely,

12:41.719 --> 12:42.678
Noriko.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.434
"Noriko!"

12:49.768 --> 12:52.229
That was great.
That, just now, was so great!

12:52.313 --> 12:55.858
I love how you've started
calling her "Noriko."

12:57.902 --> 13:02.406
Noriko, it's coming on. It's coming!

13:02.490 --> 13:03.574
Dear!

13:05.701 --> 13:07.369
Right, thanks, Tsuta!

13:07.453 --> 13:08.996
See you tomorrow. Noriko!

13:16.295 --> 13:17.505
Right.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.726
Here, I'll do it.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.729
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.527
Your sister, she's cute.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.029
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.198
It looks like
she really loves her big brother.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.412
Why did you tell her
you were a part-time worker?

13:52.831 --> 13:57.169
Because I didn't know what else to say.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.467
Tonight, I'll sleep in the store.

14:04.134 --> 14:04.969
What?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.513
You need room for your arm.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.473
No, I'll be fine.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.811
It won't heal
if you don't have some good rest.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.396
Right?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.926
All right then, good night.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.137
Good night.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.337
Hello.

15:23.047 --> 15:23.964
Welcome.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.549
Hello.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.434
Can I help you?

15:36.101 --> 15:39.855
Yeah, I'm looking for something.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.107
What kind of goldfish?

15:43.025 --> 15:43.859
Goldfish?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.531
Of course, it's a goldfish shop.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.952
Are you hurt?

15:53.827 --> 15:54.995
What?

15:55.079 --> 15:56.330
Some kind of quarrel?

15:58.290 --> 16:00.501
That's no good. You've got to be careful.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.548
"Sakura Ping Pong Pearl."

16:07.883 --> 16:08.926
This is nice.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.721
Sakura.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.266
My wife's namesake.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.734
Give me this one. I'll take it home.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.147
Haruto.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.274
Was that…

17:06.900 --> 17:11.071
Yes. He bought a Sakura Ping Pong Pearl
and left.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.118
Why?

17:17.661 --> 17:19.663
Why would he buy a goldfish?

17:21.915 --> 17:24.460
He's not gonna take care of it.

17:27.838 --> 17:31.967
Should I have said, "This is beyond you.
I won't sell it to you?"

17:32.051 --> 17:32.885
That's…

17:37.598 --> 17:38.807
That's…

17:39.641 --> 17:41.602
If a customer says he wants something,

17:42.728 --> 17:45.397
you can't not sell it to him, can you?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.048
Are you worried about him?

18:15.010 --> 18:15.844
What?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.640
You can…

18:21.058 --> 18:24.144
You can go home if you want to.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.277
That's quite a big problem.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.740
Many women have trouble dealing with
their husbands' sexual fetishes.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.993
But that sounds quite difficult for you.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.120
NORIKO HOKABE

18:41.203 --> 18:42.037
Yes.

18:44.498 --> 18:48.544
You are the type of person

18:48.627 --> 18:52.631
who finds meaning in life
when you are needed.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.301
You are afraid to refuse things,
aren't you?

18:57.094 --> 18:57.928
What?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.764
Yes, that's right.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.600
But then, you'll be restrained
by your husband,

19:03.684 --> 19:05.727
and you won't be able to move.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.026
NORIKO HOKABE

19:13.110 --> 19:14.319
PUER DARK

19:19.491 --> 19:22.536
You should be more free.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.455
Free?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.253
But…

19:56.528 --> 19:57.529
That's great.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.075
Now, her breast next.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.459
- Is that okay?
- It's fine.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.085
I'm not asking you.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.172
- You're asking Noriko.
- Please…

20:31.688 --> 20:33.273
Now, kiss.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.206
I'm sorry.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.709
Kiss.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.289
Mr. Tsuta…

21:42.759 --> 21:43.885
That's enough, Tsuta.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.014
Thanks.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.516
Noriko, let's go.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.517
Come on.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.288
I'm sorry for crying out his name.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.125
It's fine. Tsuta's a good guy, right?

22:17.794 --> 22:18.837
You like him, right?

22:30.974 --> 22:31.975
Noriko…

22:32.809 --> 22:34.102
- Noriko!
- Taro!

23:21.733 --> 23:23.235
Hello. What is it?

23:23.777 --> 23:27.781
Nori. I'm sorry, I forgot my lunch.
Can you bring it here?

23:31.618 --> 23:32.744
All right.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.081
We don't need lunch for Tsuta today.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.499
What?

23:37.999 --> 23:40.627
He's taking a sick day from work
due to a cold.

23:40.710 --> 23:41.545
Later.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.383
Big brother, are you there?

24:40.520 --> 24:41.479
Hello.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.322
Where's my brother?

24:52.657 --> 24:56.870
He's delivering a fish tank to a customer.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.080
I see.

24:59.998 --> 25:00.916
Yes.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.169
Why is the shop closed
even though you're here?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.965
We're taking inventory today.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.552
I see.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.519
Ms. Sakura Hiraga.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.731
Yes?

25:30.070 --> 25:31.863
Please break up with my brother.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.409
You two are together, aren't you?

25:42.207 --> 25:45.418
I can see it in his face. It's so obvious.

25:47.128 --> 25:50.465
You're much older, aren't you?

25:52.425 --> 25:53.426
Besides…

26:01.810 --> 26:04.145
I feel sorry for my brother,

26:06.147 --> 26:08.024
having to lie about his relationship.

26:10.610 --> 26:11.611
So…

26:14.322 --> 26:15.699
please break up with him.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.080
Yes?

26:22.872 --> 26:23.915
Hello.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.501
603 TSUTA

26:26.584 --> 26:27.419
What?

26:28.545 --> 26:31.673
I heard you're taking a sick day
from work because of a cold.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.259
Here, please eat this.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.978
About your address,

26:45.812 --> 26:50.025
we received a New Year's card from you,
so I got it from that.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.198
Sorry for bothering you. Please take care.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.704
Wait.

27:06.041 --> 27:06.958
Actually…

27:09.085 --> 27:10.712
I don't have a cold.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.321
This hamburger steak is great!

27:37.155 --> 27:38.782
The cheese really goes well with it.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.261
The day you came to our place,
my husband kept asking,

28:01.471 --> 28:03.973
"It felt good when Tsuta touched you,
didn't it?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.518
Who's better at it, me or Tsuta?"

28:07.143 --> 28:09.104
He only asks me that kind of thing.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.564
"You're better at it than he is.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.817
You're the only one I love."

28:14.567 --> 28:17.821
When I tell him that,
he gets happy like a child.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.160
I'm sorry.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.373
Why are you apologizing to me?

28:33.461 --> 28:34.838
Because, together with him,

28:38.091 --> 28:39.676
I hurt your feelings.

28:43.054 --> 28:46.975
I won't visit your place anymore.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.858
I think that's best.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.490
Whenever I see you…

29:04.784 --> 29:07.579
Whenever I see you
eating something I prepared,

29:08.413 --> 29:10.039
I get aroused somehow.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.129
That's weird, isn't it? But…

29:18.423 --> 29:19.883
If I keep seeing you,

29:21.718 --> 29:23.887
I won't be able to stop myself.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.002
I've only ever been with him.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.250
I'll make you lunch again.

31:05.989 --> 31:06.906
Mr. Tsuta.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.066
I feel sorry for my brother,

31:42.692 --> 31:44.485
having to lie about his relationship.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.112
So…

31:49.741 --> 31:51.034
please break up with him.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.255
TOYODA GOLDFISH

32:11.095 --> 32:11.971
I'm back.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.987
Sakura?

33:06.442 --> 33:08.027
So, you finally came back.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.243
You're no fool.

33:17.161 --> 33:20.790
Something that could tarnish
our salon's image, like infidelity,

33:21.708 --> 33:23.209
no way you'd keep it going.

33:26.629 --> 33:29.674
You wouldn't want to cause trouble
for our staff, right?

33:31.634 --> 33:33.803
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hit you.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.516
It's no use getting all worked up
about the goldfish seller.

33:43.813 --> 33:44.981
If you apologize properly,

33:46.190 --> 33:47.775
I'll let you off this time.

33:52.780 --> 33:53.781
What's wrong with you?

33:54.615 --> 33:55.867
Where's your "I'm sorry"?

33:57.326 --> 34:00.455
What goldfish need most is clean water.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.165
What?

34:02.248 --> 34:06.169
If you keep it in a small bowl,
change the water every day.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.672
Don't overfeed it.
Keep a stable temperature.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.968
Be sure to remove any slime from the bowl.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.638
If you don't,
the goldfish will get sick soon.

34:18.306 --> 34:21.642
Anyways, observe your goldfish closely.

34:25.146 --> 34:29.233
If it's listless, it'll get better
if you put it in saltwater.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.612
The first three days
are hard on its internal organs,

34:32.695 --> 34:33.946
so, don't feed it.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.617
I'll give you some notes later
about how to care for it.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.077
What?

34:42.121 --> 34:43.081
Today…

34:45.333 --> 34:47.543
I only came here to help out the goldfish.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.049
Hey, don't fuck around with me!

34:53.132 --> 34:54.967
Change the water every day?

34:55.051 --> 34:57.136
I'm busy! I don't have that kind of time!

34:57.220 --> 34:58.429
With the way you do it,

35:00.348 --> 35:04.769
the goldfish will end up dying
in agony in dirty water.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.272
Like I care about that.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.484
Who cares
if one or two of these things die?

35:14.070 --> 35:15.071
Stop it!

35:17.198 --> 35:18.366
Don't touch it.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.172
I'm not…

35:35.049 --> 35:36.717
I'm not coming back here again.

36:33.900 --> 36:34.942
I am not…

36:35.484 --> 36:37.486
I am not junk!

36:49.624 --> 36:50.541
You can…

36:51.667 --> 36:54.629
You can go home if you want to.

37:25.743 --> 37:26.661
There you are.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.372
Have you eaten already?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.172
I brought it back.

37:39.548 --> 37:42.677
Goldfish can't escape on their own.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.455
What's wrong, Haruto?

38:17.503 --> 38:18.713
Did something happen?

38:23.259 --> 38:24.093
No.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.471
Nothing happened.

38:51.954 --> 38:55.416
Welcome home, Sakura.

39:02.381 --> 39:08.054
I'm home, Haruto.
