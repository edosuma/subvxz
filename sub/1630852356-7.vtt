08:01.330 --> 08:04.329
because you're definitely on
the naughty list!

08:04.330 --> 08:06.210
No!

08:07.420 --> 08:08.420
Aah! [groans]

08:08.421 --> 08:09.579
Merry Christmas

08:09.580 --> 08:11.749
and thank you
for shopping at Hudkins.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.379
Look, Cricket!
That nice man I helped
got me some hot chocolate.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.419
So how'd it go with Santa?

08:17.420 --> 08:19.379
[grunts]
It was a disaster!

08:19.380 --> 08:21.289
There's no way I'm gettin' on
the nice list now!

08:21.290 --> 08:23.379
And that means no presents.

08:23.380 --> 08:24.380
[groans]

08:24.381 --> 08:25.749
Oh, come now, Cricket,

08:25.750 --> 08:27.539
I still believe
there's some good in you.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.169
You just gotta keep tryin'.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.499
Cricket? Cricket!

08:31.500 --> 08:33.459
[Nancy] Well, we may not
have gotten Bill a gift,

08:33.460 --> 08:36.119
but there's still time
to make him a gift!

08:36.120 --> 08:39.919
Good thinkin'!
But it's gotta be awesome,
thoughtful, and personal.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.750
Right! Let's get started!

08:46.290 --> 08:49.539
Finished! Oh, man,
Bill is gonna love his...

08:49.540 --> 08:52.329
personalized statue?

08:52.330 --> 08:54.329
- It's bad!
- So bad!

08:54.330 --> 08:57.499
We can't give Bill
this abomination! It's hideous!

08:57.500 --> 09:00.169
We've got no choice.
We have to go to the store.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.119
If we're quick,
maybe he won't notice.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.459
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

09:03.460 --> 09:05.499
I'm an old woman, don't rush me!

09:05.500 --> 09:07.789
There you are! Where ya goin'?

09:07.790 --> 09:10.249
Uh... caroling?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.329
[gasps] I'll come with you!
Let me grab my coat!

09:12.330 --> 09:14.379
Real smooth.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.789
Cricket!

09:15.790 --> 09:17.539
Cricket! [sighs]
There you are!

09:17.540 --> 09:20.619
I know this looks bad.
You're on the naughty list.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.209
But I believe that you can st--

09:22.210 --> 09:24.789
Oh, forget it, Tilly!
Christmas is over.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.289
I'm not gettin' any presents

09:26.290 --> 09:28.749
and I'm gonna freeze
in this park.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.209
I could do good deeds
from now until morning

09:31.210 --> 09:32.999
and I still
wouldn't get presents.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Nothing I do matters.

09:36.210 --> 09:39.079
Nothing I do matters.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.829
What are you
talkin' about, Cricket?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.419
It always matters!

09:42.420 --> 09:44.619

you've ever done!

13:20.920 --> 13:23.249

of our city's
beloved Christmas tree.

Hi, Maria! Love the show!

14:12.000 --> 14:14.249
Santa, you've
checked your list,
you've checked it twice.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.289
Is this girl naughty or nice?

14:16.290 --> 14:18.499
Oh, she's on
the naughty list for sure!

14:18.500 --> 14:20.539
I'm on the naughty list?

14:30.170 --> 14:32.329
There must be a way to fix this.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.919
No, there isn't!

14:33.920 --> 14:35.709
Selfish little girl,
you're on the naughty list

14:35.710 --> 14:37.289
and you've ruined Christmas.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.579
Do you have anything
you want to say

14:38.580 --> 14:39.749
to the people of Big City?

14:39.750 --> 14:42.499
I... I, uh...

Are you here to remind me
how naughty I am?

18:57.460 --> 18:59.249
Hmm. Well, I--

18:59.250 --> 19:01.459
Save your breath.
I know where I stand.

19:01.460 --> 19:04.039
I just thought that if I
wasn't gettin' any presents,

19:04.040 --> 19:06.459
then I was free
to do whatever I wanted!

19:06.460 --> 19:09.669
But now I've
messed everything up,
for me and for Tilly!

Christmas isn't always
happy for everyone.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.709
And I knew
you were having a hard time.

19:16.710 --> 19:20.289
Which is why I got you a gift.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.579
A... a gift?

19:21.580 --> 19:23.579
[Santa]
This isn't just any gift.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.919
This is a magical gift.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.709
It can be anything you'd like.

19:27.710 --> 19:30.709
It can be a new bike,
a toy tank...

19:30.710 --> 19:32.499
heck, a real tank!

19:32.500 --> 19:37.000
Anything you want for Christmas,
you'll find inside.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.459
Thanks, Santa,

19:39.460 --> 19:40.789
but the only thing
I want for Christmas

19:40.790 --> 19:42.209
doesn't come in a box.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.959
All I want is for Tilly

19:43.960 --> 19:45.669
to be put back on the nice list.

19:45.670 --> 19:48.329
Hmm, interesting.

19:48.330 --> 19:51.379
If that's what you want,
Cricket, I'll see
what I can do.

19:51.380 --> 19:54.209
Oh! And Santa,
can I also ask to be at home

19:54.210 --> 19:55.579
and out of this blizzard?

19:55.580 --> 19:57.079
Ho ho ho!

19:57.080 --> 19:59.670
That sure does sound nice!

20:01.420 --> 20:03.209
Santa?

20:03.210 --> 20:06.999
Why, that no good stinking elf
left me alone in a blizzard!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.379
Oh, man, you guys won't believe

20:15.380 --> 20:17.119
what just happened to me! I--

20:17.120 --> 20:18.880
Oh. Hey, Tilly.

- Look, look, look, look!
- Cricket, what is it?

20:52.710 --> 20:55.709
- [gasps]
- It's a Christmas miracle!

20:55.710 --> 20:57.209
Wait, I don't get it.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.209
Why would Santa
leave me presents?

20:59.210 --> 21:00.709
I ruined Christmas.

21:00.710 --> 21:03.119
Well, Santa gave me
one Christmas wish,

21:03.120 --> 21:06.379
so I wished for you
to be on the nice list.

21:06.380 --> 21:08.459
Cricket, you did that for me?

21:08.460 --> 21:11.169
I knew there was
good in you, brother.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.459
Merry Christmas!

21:13.460 --> 21:15.289
Don't move, don't move!

21:15.290 --> 21:16.579
That's perfect for
the first Christmas photo!

21:16.580 --> 21:17.879
- Blaaah!
- [laughs]

21:17.880 --> 21:20.079
Ma, Nancy! Merry Christmas!

21:20.080 --> 21:23.169
- Oh, Merry Christmas, Bill.
- Merry Christmas.

21:23.170 --> 21:26.669
Op, op, op! I don't wanna
hear a word until after
we exchange presents!

21:26.670 --> 21:30.209
Now, Bill, we've got
something to tell you...

21:30.210 --> 21:32.419
We didn't get you anything.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.289
What in the world
are you talkin' about?

21:34.290 --> 21:36.789
What would you call that?!

21:36.790 --> 21:37.790
[both scream]

21:37.791 --> 21:39.669

we're gonna do

21:41.380 --> 21:43.619

you wanna do today.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.209
Right, Alice?

21:45.210 --> 21:46.419
[sighs] Yup.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.169
Merry Christmas, Billy Boy.

- Yippee! Say "tinsel"!

gonna believe this!

21:52.540 --> 21:54.499
This present's
got your name on it!

21:54.500 --> 21:55.959
What?! Are you pullin' my leg?!

21:55.960 --> 21:57.379
See for yourself!

21:57.380 --> 21:58.879
No kidding...
