00:11.960 --> 00:14.480
OSHER GUNSBERG:
Previously on The Bachelorette...

00:14.480 --> 00:16.760
Dee, this is Brooke.
Nice to meet you.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.240
BROOKE: I remember home towns
on Nick's season.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.200
Hey!

00:21.200 --> 00:23.160
(EXHALES) Breathe, Brooke, breathe.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.800
..Brooke faced home towns,
this time in the firing line.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.320
We could see our friend...
BOTH: Falling.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.640
Being both interstate,
how will that work?

00:34.640 --> 00:36.320
Um...

00:36.320 --> 00:38.760
And bombshells from Holly's mum...

00:38.760 --> 00:40.160
Holly has always voiced

00:40.160 --> 00:43.960
that she would have
ideally no children or maybe one.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.400
BROOKE: I feel
completely and utterly blindsided.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.920
..left Brooke broken.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.920
I just don't know
where I'm standing right now.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.480
(SOBS)

00:59.600 --> 01:01.240
Tonight...

01:01.240 --> 01:02.880
..Darvid...
Mwah!

01:02.880 --> 01:03.880
..Jamie-Lee...

01:03.880 --> 01:05.440
Yeah. We're getting back
into nature.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
..and Holly...

01:06.440 --> 01:07.800
Hello.
Hi.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.800
..take the reins
on three magical dates...

01:10.800 --> 01:12.680
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

01:12.680 --> 01:15.320
JAMIE-LEE: I'm well and truly
in love with Brooke.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.720
Whew! Getting all flushed.

01:17.720 --> 01:18.880
..before...

01:18.880 --> 01:20.400
Think we've found our roadblock.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.240
DARVID: I can't just pack up
and leave, and neither can she.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.520
..some harsh truths...

01:24.520 --> 01:27.240
I don't know where to go from here.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.320
..and heartbreak.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.920
That just takes me back
to previous relationships

01:30.920 --> 01:34.600
where they're just gonna be, like,
"Oh, I love you, but..."

01:38.200 --> 01:41.440
I came here to find love. (SNIFFS)

01:41.440 --> 01:43.600
And it's slamming me in the heart

01:43.600 --> 01:47.400
that that's probably not
what's gonna happen here.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.760
BROOKE:
When I think about where I started,

02:02.760 --> 02:06.960
I think it's absolutely surreal
that I'm down to my last three,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.280
but I've had to break hearts
along the way

02:09.280 --> 02:12.840
and that's been
really and extremely hard for me.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.480
In this experience, I've really
had to stay true to myself and say,

02:18.480 --> 02:22.760
"What do I actually want for my life
and what do I want in a partner?"

02:22.760 --> 02:27.520
Now being here and having
these three beautiful connections,

02:27.520 --> 02:30.800
with Jamie-Lee, Holly and Darvid,

02:30.800 --> 02:32.880
it makes sense - it all makes sense.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.240
This week, Darvid, Holly and
Jamie-Lee get to plan a date for me.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.080
The whole idea is for me
to discover something about them

02:41.080 --> 02:43.200
that I don't already know.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.520
And first up,
I can't wait to see Darvid.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.960
Oh, my God!
Look at this shiny number.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.520
I know. I've gone all-out.
Lovely to meet you.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.920
BROOKE: I know from the get-go,
we had this instant connection.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.600
My name is Darvid, which is Persian.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.600
So I've brought...
Are you a Persian prince?

02:57.600 --> 02:58.640
I could be.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
(LAUGHS)
If you want me to be.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.240
It was unconscious.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.120
Like, it's like we've known
each other for a very long time.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.800
This is...can you guess?
Uh, yeah.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.760
I thought, fitting the Persian
theme, I'd give you three wishes.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.160
I know you already
used the first one on me appearing.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.040
How did you know?
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:15.040 --> 03:18.360
BROOKE: But home towns did bring up
some real issues.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.800
I do have a few concerns.

03:21.800 --> 03:27.680
So, being both interstate,
how will that work?

03:27.680 --> 03:29.560
Um...

03:29.560 --> 03:33.880
I do worry how you're going to
build your relationship

03:33.880 --> 03:37.040
when reality kicks in.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.360
BROOKE:
We do live in different states,

03:39.360 --> 03:43.720
and it is something
that we do have to nut out.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.400
I'm a little bit anxious.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.440
(SIGHS)

03:46.440 --> 03:48.400
But today, I don't really
want to think about that.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.600
I want to have fun.
I want to see him.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
(SIGHS)

03:51.600 --> 03:55.240
Now I just need him to show up.
(LAUGHS)

03:59.560 --> 04:01.200
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:02.280 --> 04:03.960
(LAUGHS)

04:05.560 --> 04:07.040
Good morning.
Good morning.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.960
Another dramatic entrance.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.600
(LAUGHS)
How are ya?

04:10.600 --> 04:14.000
You've got to stop coming in on me.
Oh! Whoa! (LAUGHS)

04:14.000 --> 04:16.080
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:16.080 --> 04:18.280
You are kidding!

04:18.280 --> 04:21.120
Lose my cool as soon as I see ya.
How are ya?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.280
I'm good. How are you?
Yeah, good.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.080
DARVID:
After seeing Brooke on the bank,

04:25.080 --> 04:27.960
beautiful green eyes,
big white smile,

04:27.960 --> 04:30.120
I fall out of the kayak.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.920
(LAUGHS)

04:34.000 --> 04:35.680
(BLEEP)!

04:35.680 --> 04:39.600
(LAUGHS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

04:41.440 --> 04:43.480
Did you have too many wines
or something?
No.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.240
BROOKE: I think my whole mood changes
when I see Darvid.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.880
I just instantly get, like,
really happy, comfortable and calm.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.640
(LAUGHS)
Missed ya.
Missed you too.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.200
Yeah, it was really nice
to just, like,

04:54.200 --> 04:56.120
give him a nice kiss and cuddle.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.560
What are we doing today?
I'm assuming kayaking.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.120
Well, that'll be the first thing.
OK.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.240
But there's a couple of things
planned. The tables have turned.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.080
So I'm not gonna give it all away.
They absolutely have.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.720
I like keeping you in the dark.
Don't know if I like it.
You've kept me in the dark.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.480
You know
I'm a bit of a control freak.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.560
But I'm excited today.
I want to get to know you more.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.840
So...
Yeah, good.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.440
Should be fun. It'll be a good day.
Yeah.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.320
DARVID: Today is the first date that
I have actually been able to plan,

05:17.320 --> 05:20.480
so I wanted to take Brooke
to the beautiful Glenworth Valley.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.720
I want to show her a bit about me
that she might not have seen.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.440
Alright. Let's do it.
Let's go.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.480
OK.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
(LAUGHS)

05:27.480 --> 05:30.760
Let's not do it
as dramatic as you did. (LAUGHS)

05:30.760 --> 05:32.680
DARVID:
I'm an outdoorsy, adventurous guy.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.720
I feel like
we haven't really touched on that

05:34.720 --> 05:35.840
in our more serious dates.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.680
And she's off.
Ah!

05:37.680 --> 05:40.640
So...today's about having fun -
keep it light, have a laugh

05:40.640 --> 05:42.960
and further that connection
that we've already got.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.960
(KOOKABURRAS LAUGH)

05:50.120 --> 05:53.480
Kookaburras are out today.
I know.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.040
This is nice, huh?

05:55.040 --> 05:56.920
This is beautiful.
Mmm.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.720
I actually love this stuff.
Me too.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.720
What do you like
about doing this stuff?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.560
I like...all this stuff.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.720
I just, like...
Yeah.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.680
..I like having a minute to relax,

06:06.680 --> 06:08.800
but I also like doing things...

06:08.800 --> 06:10.320
..a bit more exciting.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.200
It's just nice
to get away from it all.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.560
Yeah.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.280
Something very peaceful
about this, though.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.320
Oh!

06:17.320 --> 06:20.400
BROOKE: I just love
spending time with Darvid.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.480
Every time I spend time with him,
I find out a little bit more,

06:22.480 --> 06:24.160
which I like.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.000
Very lucky.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.120
If I wasn't such a bush girl,
I don't know how I would respond.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.360
(LAUGHS)
But... (LAUGHS)

06:30.360 --> 06:32.520
I knew you'd be...good.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.960
Yeah.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.000
Abseiling, kayaking,
motorbike riding, quad biking...

06:38.000 --> 06:39.200
Yeah?
Yeah.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.640
Honestly, like,
we just amused ourselves as kids.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.000
So it takes me back.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.320
Mmm.
Thank you.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.680
Appreciate this.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.960
BROOKE: Kind of adventuring
and doing, you know, kayaking.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.000
Like, this is me.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.160
These are the things
that I grew up doing.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.480
To do that with someone that you
care about and have a connection with

06:58.480 --> 07:00.880
is just, like, all the better.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.480
Originally,
I thought I was going horse riding,

07:02.480 --> 07:03.960
which I wasn't...
wasn't too mad about.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.080
I was, like...
Today?

07:05.080 --> 07:06.840
I can't ride. Can you ride?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.680
Mmm. A little.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.080
Couple of years back, I let out
two horses on one of my clients.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.080
And they bolted and spooked
on the road.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.880
Oh, my God!
I had to lead them back
with some sourdough.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.400
Well...
With sourdough?
Yeah.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.480
(LAUGHS) That's one way to get them.
That's one way to lead...me.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.440
(LAUGHS) Give them some sourdough.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.200
Noted.
I love bread.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.360
Noted. Me too.
Bread, butter and salt.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.880
(LAUGHS)
Oh!

07:30.880 --> 07:32.280
Bit of olive oil.
Olive oil.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.120
Oh! (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) Stop.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.320
Brooke is nothing but fun,
to be honest.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.240
But it's more than that for me.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.920
Hello.
Hi.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.040
Mwah.
Cute.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.760
DARVID: I think we'd have
an awesome life together.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.920
I think...we've got
so much chemistry. We have laughs.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.560
I love everything about her.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.320
So...it leaves me thinking...

07:51.320 --> 07:53.640
..and just feeling like
that's all I want.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.880
You enjoy that?
Yeah. It was nice and peaceful.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.360
Yeah. Relaxing.
And relaxing.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.600
(SIGHS)
Not all they got in store for you.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.880
Oh, wow. What else do we have here?

08:02.880 --> 08:03.880
Mmm.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.640
I mean, honestly, I don't know
how this could get any better.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.000
(CLICKS TONGUE)

08:09.000 --> 08:10.120
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
Quad bike?
Yeah.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.440
BROOKE: Quad bikes?

08:15.440 --> 08:16.920
Are you serious?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.640
DARVID: So I always had a quad bike
growing up.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.040
Yep.
And dirt bikes.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.760
And I know
you said that before, so...
Yep.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.240
It'll be fun - I thought we could...

08:23.240 --> 08:24.840
Oh, this is gonna be so good.
..kick it up a notch.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.240
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
I actually love quad biking.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
This is sick.
Good.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.240
Aw!

08:29.240 --> 08:30.760
BROOKE: I'm already loving today,

08:30.760 --> 08:33.880
finding out little things
about Darvid... (LAUGHS)

08:33.880 --> 08:37.120
..things
that I probably didn't expect.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.200
My brothers are gonna be
completely envious, because...

08:40.200 --> 08:42.120
..it's actually so fun. (LAUGHS)

08:42.120 --> 08:44.040
(ENGINE REVS)

08:44.040 --> 08:47.840
(IMITATES ENGINE) Sorry. (LAUGHS)

08:47.840 --> 08:49.200
I want to go! (LAUGHS)

08:49.200 --> 08:50.400
Yeah.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
Whoo!

08:53.520 --> 08:55.120
And we're off.

08:57.640 --> 08:58.680
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

08:58.680 --> 09:00.960
DARVID: Brooke's quick,
and she looks fierce.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.560
A quick whip!

09:02.560 --> 09:04.040
(LAUGHS)

09:04.040 --> 09:06.120
I just love this so much.

09:06.120 --> 09:11.240
Bit of a ruthless nut in some way.
I probably wanted to go faster.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.080
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

09:13.080 --> 09:15.000
(CALLS OUT)

09:15.000 --> 09:17.680
(LAUGHS)

09:17.680 --> 09:19.160
Come on, Darvid.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.440
But he can't keep up.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.880
Bye!

09:24.840 --> 09:26.040
(LAUGHS)

09:28.840 --> 09:30.960
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

09:30.960 --> 09:32.440
(LAUGHS)

09:32.440 --> 09:34.760
DARVID: I already knew
that Brooke and I got along,

09:34.760 --> 09:36.400
but after seeing her
on the back of a quad bike

09:36.400 --> 09:38.240
ripping around, having fun...

09:38.240 --> 09:41.320
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

09:41.320 --> 09:42.920
..I can definitely see her
in my world.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.160
Whoo!

09:45.160 --> 09:46.200
That was so much...

09:46.200 --> 09:47.520
I can't get my helmet off.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.760
(BOTH LAUGH)
That was so much fun!

09:49.760 --> 09:52.480
Little speed demon.
Oh, your bike's rolling. (LAUGHS)

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
Oh!

09:53.480 --> 09:55.800
DARVID:
I've never had a partner that
wants to do those things with me,

09:55.800 --> 09:57.200
so...picturing her and I
on our days off,

09:57.200 --> 09:59.360
enjoying these sorts of activities,
it's pretty exciting.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.080
Ahh!
I like you in this environment.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.560
Me?
Yeah. You look...

10:02.560 --> 10:04.080
'Cause I'm
totally in my element right now.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.360
I know! You were off!

10:05.360 --> 10:08.240
There's a lot of things
that I love about being with Darvid.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.400
Oh!
I had so much fun.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.720
Good. Me too.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.760
BROOKE:
But the way that he makes me feel,

10:15.760 --> 10:17.480
that's the most beautiful part.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.920
Did you enjoy that?
Yeah, that was awesome.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.120
I can't believe how good you were.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.600
Oh, well...
Actually...

10:21.600 --> 10:23.360
Don't underestimate me.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.000
BROOKE: He's always been
so consistent and there's always been

10:26.000 --> 10:30.480
a comfortable feeling with him
that he chooses me.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.360
(LAUGHS) Can you please look?
Do I have anything on my face?

10:33.360 --> 10:35.280
No, you look good.
Like, not even a booger or something?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.240
Nope.
OK, good. (LAUGHS)

10:37.240 --> 10:39.080
No, you're good.
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.880
(BOTH LAUGH)

10:41.880 --> 10:43.880
Mmm!
I had fun.

10:43.880 --> 10:47.200
Yeah. Good date idea.
Good.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.280
BROOKE: He's never actually
said verbally those words,

10:49.280 --> 10:51.240
but, like,
I always feel like he's just...

10:51.240 --> 10:55.080
..really, like,
loving and protective of me.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.760
I've never really felt that,
like, instantly with people.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.000
We've got something next, but...
Yeah.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
..I'll tell you that...

11:01.000 --> 11:02.120
Later?
Later.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.200
Whew! Getting all flushed.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.720
(LAUGHS)

11:16.120 --> 11:17.840
DARVID:
It's just been over the weeks

11:17.840 --> 11:19.880
that I've learnt
a lot more about her,

11:19.880 --> 11:23.560
and it's just the crazy coincidences
and how much we've got in common

11:23.560 --> 11:27.200
that really makes me
project into the future.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.440
This actually could be my person.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.560
The only thing
that's at stake, I guess, is...

11:33.560 --> 11:34.680
..my heart.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.000
(LAUGHS) Um...

11:55.760 --> 11:57.720
(BROOKE LAUGHS)

11:57.720 --> 12:00.480
Wait. Keep them closed.
Keep them closed. OK.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.960
What if I step in something?
OK, open.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.760
Open?

12:04.760 --> 12:07.120
Oh, God.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.800
(LAUGHS)
Oh! (LAUGHS)

12:08.800 --> 12:09.960
What is this?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.680
A little something.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.280
BROOKE: I think today's date went...

12:14.280 --> 12:17.320
..way above what I expected.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.200
It's totally blown me away.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.680
Oh! You got, like,
champagne and strawberries.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.240
Oh, hello!
Hello.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.960
(BOTH LAUGH)
Oof! Hello.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.440
I'll jump in.
OK.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.840
I'll help you in.
Alright.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.920
BROOKE: I'm just
really lost for words with Darvid.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.440
He makes me feel
really appreciated...

12:34.440 --> 12:35.880
..and seen.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.800
(SIGHS)
Oh, this is so magical.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.160
(SIGHS)

12:40.160 --> 12:42.000
It's nice, huh?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.840
This is really nice.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.640
What a perfect ending.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.120
To a fun day.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.600
I know!

12:48.600 --> 12:51.040
BROOKE: I've just discovered
so much about him, but also, like,

12:51.040 --> 12:53.400
these are things
that I love doing as well.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.760
That's someone I picture myself with.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.440
You know how much I love,
like, adrenaline things.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.080
I couldn't believe
how much of a natural you were.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.440
You were whizzing.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.400
(LAUGHS) I actually doubted, like...
Me?

13:03.400 --> 13:05.760
Well, no,
I never doubted that you were fun,

13:05.760 --> 13:06.840
but I just thought, like, "Wow!"

13:06.840 --> 13:09.320
It's nice to see you
in this, like, really...

13:09.320 --> 13:10.960
..like, adrenaline sort of...

13:10.960 --> 13:12.400
Yeah, that's...
..interest.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.440
I thought it was really cool.
..that's me normally.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.520
I know I come off, like,
really serious and, like...

13:16.520 --> 13:18.080
No, I just...
Not serious, but, like...

13:18.080 --> 13:20.400
Yeah.
..safe sometimes.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.360
But I'm not really like that.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.960
It's good. I like seeing this.
Yeah. Yeah.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.320
But this is, like...this is me.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.240
Like, if I was to...

13:28.240 --> 13:30.200
..book a weekend away or something,
this is where I'd come -

13:30.200 --> 13:31.920
like, in the middle of nowhere.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.440
Do a little experience? Me too.
Yeah.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.440
Serenity.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.280
Yeah.
It's really beautiful.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.520
I mean, a hot tub.
I know.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.120
(LAUGHS)
Oh, it's been pretty chilly today.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.880
DARVID: It's becoming real now.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.680
Brooke's an amazing girl, and...

13:51.680 --> 13:54.200
..she's definitely a girl
that I see a future with,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.880
but there were a lot of questions
raised by my family at home towns.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.480
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.440
DARVID: Brooke and I
live in different states,

14:03.440 --> 14:07.360
and I'm not sure exactly
how our relationship would work.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.120
Cheers.
Cheers.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.840
And that's what's
in the back of my mind tonight.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.400
I've really had a nice time
with you.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.560
Yeah.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.440
It was really nice
to meet your family as well.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.440
Yeah.
At home towns.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.920
How did you walk away from that?

14:19.920 --> 14:23.080
Good. I...honestly, I really, like,
loved getting to know them.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.600
Mmm.
Your mum definitely hit me
with some really good questions,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.720
Like, the logistical stuff.
Yeah.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.920
Living in Brissie.
I figured that.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.640
I actually did want to talk to you
about that, I guess, because...
Yeah.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.040
Like, where do you see...

14:35.040 --> 14:39.400
..us, obviously,
if we get to the end together?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.600
Um...

14:41.600 --> 14:43.080
..like, I only just
moved to Melbourne.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.200
Mmm.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.680
So I moved there for more, like...
(SIGHS)

14:45.680 --> 14:48.440
..you know, opportunity and to
open myself up to a lot more doors.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.040
'Cause I was getting
really complacent in Perth.
Mm-hm.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.320
And, to be honest, like,
'cause it's so bloody cold...

14:53.320 --> 14:54.760
It IS cold.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.000
..um, I'm still open to the thought
of, like, just changing it up a bit.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.440
Um...
OK.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.080
..but there's some things
that I still want to do there.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.920
Like, I...I'm not a person
that, like, gives up really easily.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.960
So...I want to, like,
give it a crack.

15:07.960 --> 15:08.960
Um...

15:08.960 --> 15:10.680
What's your view on it?

15:10.680 --> 15:12.760
I think...

15:12.760 --> 15:14.400
..similar to you, like, I've...

15:14.400 --> 15:18.040
..I mean, if my sister
wasn't about to have a...baby...

15:18.040 --> 15:20.320
Mmm.
..I would be, like...really open.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.040
That's...the only thing
that I've started to think about...

15:23.040 --> 15:26.640
So cute.
..is...being there...for him.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.800
Little man.
Like, that's gonna be cool.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.600
Like, I'll be excited for that.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.720
Sounds like you're really, really
close, which is really nice.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.160
Yeah, well,
there's not many of us, I guess.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.640
Yeah.
That's the biggest thing.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.800
I think they're just worried.
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.640
DARVID: For me to move,
it is a big decision.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.040
I'd have to sell my house,
close my business, sell my business,

15:45.040 --> 15:49.560
and I've got a nephew on the way,
so...they're big things.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.160
I can't just pack up and leave,
and neither can she.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.680
Do you want me to be the realist?

15:54.680 --> 15:56.440
Yeah. Sure.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.360
I...

15:58.360 --> 16:01.760
..I do have a bit of a fear
of, like, long-distance.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.960
It's hard. Like, long-distance
is hard. There's no denying that.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.280
And I know that we have to go back
to our different states or...

16:06.280 --> 16:08.360
..how it would work, you know.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.440
I just...

16:10.440 --> 16:12.280
..um...

16:14.960 --> 16:17.960
Like, could you see it working?
Long-distance?

16:17.960 --> 16:19.640
Mmm.
Yeah, I could.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.520
Um...I could see it working.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.000
It's not the way
I'd want to do it...

16:25.000 --> 16:27.080
Yeah.
..is my honest...
that's my honest answer.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.320
Like, it's gonna be hard
for us to go from this...

16:32.320 --> 16:34.400
It's gonna be extremely hard.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.240
I'm not gonna deny it - like, this...
To long-distance?

16:36.240 --> 16:37.280
Yeah.
And then...

16:37.280 --> 16:39.240
It will be.
Mmm.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.200
So...
I see where you're coming from.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.240
Mmm.
I can absolutely see it.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.600
I am conflicted
and I'm absolutely scared, like...

16:47.600 --> 16:50.840
..that the risk involved
is actually just, like...

16:50.840 --> 16:52.560
..it fizzling out.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.760
Think we've found our roadblock.
Mmm.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.560
DARVID: It's pretty hard-hitting.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.960
You know,
we're talking about roadblocks

17:06.960 --> 17:09.280
and the fact that
it's gonna be really difficult.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.480
I'm also feeling very vulnerable.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.400
My feelings for Brooke
are stronger than ever.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.520
(SIGHS)

17:19.520 --> 17:21.040
It's hard.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.120
Alright?

17:41.120 --> 17:43.760
BROOKE: I picture the love story
with Darvid,

17:43.760 --> 17:45.560
but I've done long-distance before

17:45.560 --> 17:47.440
and it hasn't really worked
to my favour.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.880
I have a massive fear about it.

17:49.880 --> 17:54.360
My biggest fear is that
when we live in different states,

17:54.360 --> 17:56.800
is that it will fizzle out

17:56.800 --> 17:59.080
and...I'm left again

17:59.080 --> 18:01.160
back where I started.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.280
(SNIFFS)

18:08.840 --> 18:10.800
BROOKE: I'm petrified.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.040
OSHER: Still to come...

18:18.040 --> 18:19.560
Did I tell you
that you're beautiful?

18:19.560 --> 18:21.680
JAMIE-LEE: I'm well and truly
in love with Brooke,

18:21.680 --> 18:25.400
and it's so important that
Brooke knows exactly where I'm at.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
..truth...

18:26.400 --> 18:28.680
I wanted to tell you exactly
how I was feeling, and I just...

18:28.680 --> 18:30.840
..I...I just...

18:30.840 --> 18:32.720
..and questions.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.040
I'm not sure.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.040
You're not sure?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.840
BROOKE:
Feel like you meet in the middle.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.880
If you love someone,
you meet them in the middle.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.400
I don't know where to go from here.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.760
Do you know how much that takes me
back to previous relationships,

18:45.760 --> 18:49.120
where they're just gonna be, like,
"Oh, I love you, but..."

18:54.200 --> 18:56.800
(SOBS)

19:08.280 --> 19:10.400
JAMIE-LEE: I'm going
to pick up Brooke for our date,

19:10.400 --> 19:14.360
and I am so nervous.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.160
The last time I saw Brooke,
at the end of home towns,

19:16.160 --> 19:19.280
I feel like
I maybe stumbled on my words.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.840
I need to, like, not,
'cause I'm gonna cry.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.720
Why?
'Cause, like...

19:29.200 --> 19:31.240
I really, really...

19:31.240 --> 19:33.400
..yeah, I definitely...

19:35.920 --> 19:37.720
..I really like you.

19:37.720 --> 19:41.640
JAMIE-LEE: I didn't tell Brooke
that I was falling in love with her,

19:41.640 --> 19:43.600
and I definitely was.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.760
Bye, babe.

19:46.400 --> 19:50.040
And I've been kicking myself
ever since.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.520
It's so important that Brooke knows
exactly where I'm at.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.080
I actually am in love with Brooke.

19:57.080 --> 20:01.000
I haven't felt like this
about someone in a very long time.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
And that's super-scary. It's huge.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.600
Hello, honey.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.280
How are you?
Wow!

20:07.280 --> 20:09.120
You look good.
(LAUGHS) How are YOU?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.120
Hi, babe. I'm good. How are you?
Oh! I'm good.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.360
So good to see you.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.680
I've missed you.
You missed me?

20:15.680 --> 20:17.760
Love it.
You look so good.
Thank... (LAUGHS)

20:17.760 --> 20:19.680
(LAUGHS)
You look amazing. Look at this.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.440
You always look so good.
Oh. Thanks, babe.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.480
So today, I've got, like,
a little day planned.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.280
OK.
It's gonna be real chill.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.440
It's just, like,
a little...a little day

20:28.440 --> 20:31.440
of, like, how life would be
if we were together.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.920
Oh!
Yeah!
I'm excited.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.440
Yeah?
A day in the life with Jamie-Lee.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.440
Yeah?
Alright.
Shall we?

20:36.440 --> 20:38.640
I'm in the passenger side. (LAUGHS)
You're in the passenger side!

20:38.640 --> 20:40.880
This is actually so different.
Can I trust your driving?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.800
No.
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:42.800 --> 20:44.800
This is a terrible idea.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.000
BROOKE: I definitely do see
a love story with Jamie-Lee.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.120
I feel like it has been
a long time coming.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.120
Oh. Hold my hand.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.160
I'm a bit of a sook.
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:55.160 --> 20:56.160
Me too, actually.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.040
BROOKE: And I feel so lucky

20:58.040 --> 21:00.600
that the universe
has finally brought us together.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.800
Are you excited?
Yeah.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.640
I have no idea
what you've got planned.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.440
Can I get hints?
Um...we're stripping it back.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.120
We're doing something that I could
see happening in our future...

21:11.120 --> 21:12.880
Mm-hm.
..a little bit.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.160
Not too much, but a little bit.
(LAUGHS) OK.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.080
BROOKE: I know Jamie-Lee,
and I know she likes nicer things,

21:19.080 --> 21:23.360
like wine, fine dining,
good food, dresses.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.240
She's kind of, like, a girl's girl.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.000
So...maybe it's along that,
little bit more relaxing.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.480
Are we going plant shopping?
Yes, we are. Surprise!

21:31.480 --> 21:33.440
(BOTH LAUGH)
I wish.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.760
Whoo!

21:34.760 --> 21:36.320
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:36.320 --> 21:39.240
I have no idea. I'm just
going with the flow. (LAUGHS)

21:42.760 --> 21:45.120
So we're very earthy.
(LAUGHS)

21:45.120 --> 21:47.280
Yeah,
we're definitely going off-road.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.040
It's the vibes that I'm getting.
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:49.040 --> 21:51.920
Well, I don't
want to spoil it, but...

21:51.920 --> 21:54.440
..you might be semi-right.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.040
Alright.
We're here.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.120
So, we're here.
Right.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.400
Where are you taking me?

22:04.400 --> 22:05.880
Well...

22:05.880 --> 22:08.400
..I've got a little something
for you for today.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.640
OK.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.880
It's to go with your outfit.
Love it.

22:13.880 --> 22:14.920
A backpack.
A little backpack.

22:14.920 --> 22:15.920
(LAUGHS)
You good?

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
Thank you.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.280
Um, so, we're going
on a little bit of a hike.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.920
Beautiful!
Yeah. Yeah.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.040
Love the idea.
Yeah.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.880
I wanted my hiking shoes,
but these will do.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.880
(LAUGHS)

22:26.880 --> 22:28.720
BROOKE: I'm really surprised.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.640
This is not what I had in my mind.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.840
A little hike. (LAUGHS)
Yeah.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.280
We're getting back into nature.

22:34.280 --> 22:39.360
But I grew up in the bush,
so I'm, like, "Sick." (LAUGHS)

22:41.040 --> 22:43.960
Wow. This is actually amazing.
Yeah.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.040
'Cause I do love being outdoors -
like, it's...

22:47.040 --> 22:49.320
..I think it's just...
how I also spent my childhood.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.360
So, like, it's just...

22:50.360 --> 22:52.200
Yeah.
..like, second nature.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.560
Yeah, totally.
Literally. Second nature.
Good one.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.280
But I didn't actually pick you
for a bush girl.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.800
JAMIE-LEE: Brooke's not wrong.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.480
I think this is definitely
Brooke's kind of thing.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.320
There was a point
where I was gonna wear, like,

23:03.320 --> 23:06.080
my Gucci sneakers today, hiking,
and I was, like, "No, Jamie.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.880
"You're not trying to show
that part of you. Stop."

23:09.880 --> 23:11.760
This, obviously,
isn't all that today is about.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.280
Yeah. Wonder what we've got planned
for the next bit.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.560
Well, I wanted
to kind of strip back everything.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.640
JAMIE-LEE:
Today, it's really important for me

23:19.640 --> 23:20.920
to tell Brooke I'm in love with her,

23:20.920 --> 23:23.280
but first,
I really want to show her that.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.760
I know Brooke loves camping,
getting outdoors.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.840
Yeah.
So I've kind of made that happen.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.800
But with my kind of way,
so we're glamping.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.640
Glamping.
(LAUGHS)

23:34.640 --> 23:35.960
This is pretty.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.840
Isn't it?
Wow!

23:37.840 --> 23:39.320
I'm not so much
of the camping type of gal,

23:39.320 --> 23:41.240
but I definitely am
the glamping type of gal,

23:41.240 --> 23:42.840
so I'm kind of hoping to show Brooke

23:42.840 --> 23:46.560
that this could really work on the
outside, if we meet in the middle.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.280
So I've got, like, a few little
things for us to have later on.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.280
OK.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.920
But, um, first, do you want
to help me with that tent?

23:53.920 --> 23:56.400
I can give you a hand, absolutely.
Fantastic.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.280
BROOKE:
I am so impressed with Jamie-Lee.

23:59.280 --> 24:03.520
She's thought about me - like, what
I like and the things that I love.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.640
She's always thinking about me,
which is really cute.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.280
Right. What are these for?

24:09.280 --> 24:11.800
Does that go in there?

24:11.800 --> 24:15.560
So these are obviously the ropes.
See where the actual door is.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.400
There's a thing here.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.440
Yeah, OK.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.560
Do you think that's...that's
not a door. Never mind. (LAUGHS)

24:20.560 --> 24:24.360
But...she has no idea
what she's doing, but... (LAUGHS)

24:24.360 --> 24:25.840
So this maybe...
Oh, that's really tall.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.520
Yeah, this goes inside, I reckon.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.840
You can set up
a Christmas tree inside.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.720
Yeah, this goes inside.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.920
Pretty much.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.080
We can have a giant party.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.080
(BOTH LAUGH)

24:36.080 --> 24:39.480
I just hope that it comes together,

24:39.480 --> 24:44.040
because if it doesn't,
this is gonna be an absolute fail.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.840
OK, wait. Maybe this is the rope...

24:46.840 --> 24:49.400
(BOTH LAUGH)

24:51.560 --> 24:53.000
Alright.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.560
As a couple putting up a tent, it
could be make-or-break, I must admit.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.280
(LAUGHS) They're so big.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.880
(BOTH LAUGH)

25:04.720 --> 25:06.880
But this is so hilarious.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.480
That's it. Pull it tight.
(LAUGHS)

25:09.480 --> 25:11.840
Oh, I'm a working up a sweat, darl.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.160
Sorry. My innuendo's
probably, like, not that great.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.920
OK. Trying to find the hole.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.560
Oh.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.120
(LAUGHS)
Always with you.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.280
You know.
We just want to get it up. (LAUGHS)

25:23.280 --> 25:26.560
Oh, shit! (LAUGHS)

25:26.560 --> 25:28.040
This is the first time
I've ever put up a tent.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.320
Ever?
Yeah.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.920
You didn't make it easy
on yourself, um...

25:31.920 --> 25:34.360
I wanted to get a pretty one.
..choosing a tent like this.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.640
A pretty... This is...this is way
beyond pretty, I can tell you now.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.880
BROOKE: I'm loving where Jamie
has gone with the idea of this date.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.840
In a relationship,
you do have to be open-minded

25:44.840 --> 25:47.840
that you are different people
and you like different things,

25:47.840 --> 25:50.520
but if you can combine
the things that you both love,

25:50.520 --> 25:53.200
I think that's really special.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.840
Alright. Dig in.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.320
Are we doing
knife and fork or...? (LAUGHS)

25:57.320 --> 25:59.080
No. Don't be ridiculous.
(LAUGHS)

25:59.080 --> 26:01.800
BROOKE: I think that's, like, the
most beautiful thing about Jamie-Lee.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.440
She's just
the most thoughtful person.

26:04.440 --> 26:09.480
I really see how thoughtful she would
be as a girlfriend, and a partner.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.240
(LAUGHS)

26:11.240 --> 26:12.960
BROOKE: And I just...

26:12.960 --> 26:16.040
..yeah, I'm in absolute awe of her -
I think she's so beautiful.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.240
(BOTH LAUGH)

26:29.040 --> 26:32.280
Honestly, today's date
has been, like, absolutely stunning.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.560
Like, it's been beautiful.
I love this sort of set-up.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.760
(LAUGHS)

26:35.760 --> 26:39.120
We've combined all
my favourite things but also, like,

26:39.120 --> 26:43.800
just being open-minded about what
our relationship could look like.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.520
You know, you could have
gone and just did something

26:45.520 --> 26:48.520
that you would normally do and...

26:48.520 --> 26:51.680
..been, like, "Here. This is me.
Enter into my world."

26:51.680 --> 26:53.720
But I think...
with you, Jamie-Lee, like,

26:53.720 --> 26:57.440
you always are thinking about me
and...it was endearing.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
Like, it's kind of, like,
"I want to do this for my girlfriend

26:59.440 --> 27:00.880
"'cause it's gonna make her happy,"

27:00.880 --> 27:02.400
which I think
that's what you would be like...

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
100%.
..as a partner.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.480
For sure.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.200
JAMIE-LEE: It is nice to hear
that Brooke kind of understands

27:07.200 --> 27:09.320
why I did plan today's date.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.240
I want her
to feel appreciated and loved,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.320
and, you know,
I always hope to be showing her

27:15.320 --> 27:19.880
where my feelings are
and how much Brooke means to me.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.880
But I also don't want you to,
like, change things.

27:21.880 --> 27:25.800
If you don't like something, like...
I know you're the one to say, like,

27:25.800 --> 27:29.600
"I'm not...be willing to compromise
or do any of that," that's fine.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.680
Yeah.
Um...

27:30.680 --> 27:31.960
I think there...
there are some things

27:31.960 --> 27:33.040
that aren't for me personally -

27:33.040 --> 27:35.160
like, I've got, like,
things I won't compromise on,

27:35.160 --> 27:37.080
and then everything else is, like...

27:37.080 --> 27:40.480
..you know, like, those things
are really big life things.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.480
Yeah.
Um...

27:41.480 --> 27:44.520
What ARE your non-negotiables?
Children, for sure.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.480
Big number? Little number?

27:46.480 --> 27:48.000
Between one and three.
Amazing.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.320
Um...

27:49.320 --> 27:52.760
..and I think everything else
is kind of, like, you figure it out.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.600
What about you?
What's your non-negotiables?

27:54.600 --> 27:56.120
(CLEARS THROAT)

27:56.120 --> 27:57.280
Similar.
Mmm.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.320
Children is definitely, like,
a non-negotiable.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.440
'Cause I just love...
Yeah.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.800
..I don't know -
I just love my family, so I just...

28:03.800 --> 28:07.240
..yeah, think one day having my own
would be, like, really special.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.280
I just can't wait.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.640
Also, like,
I think I have this, like,

28:09.640 --> 28:12.840
little maternal thing
coming through now,

28:12.840 --> 28:14.840
but, like, I always just, like...
I just want to be a mum...

28:14.840 --> 28:15.920
Yeah.
..one day.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.600
I think you'd make a great mum.
Thank you.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.760
Mmm.
I think YOU'D make a great mum.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.280
Thanks.
A cool mum.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.080
(LAUGHS) I'm a cool mum.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.560
Yeah.
You'd be a hot mum.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.840
Back atcha.
OK, we'll be both hot mums.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.080
(LAUGHS)

28:28.080 --> 28:30.520
JAMIE-LEE:
Tonight for me has been so perfect.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.240
I'm well and truly
in love with Brooke.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.040
And I think now's, like,
the...the perfect time

28:37.040 --> 28:38.920
to tell Brooke how I feel.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.040
I haven't had the chance
to even ask what your friends...
Yeah.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.240
..thought of me at home towns.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.320
They loved you.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.800
Oh.
Which was really, really sweet.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.640
Um...

28:47.640 --> 28:49.920
..I actually walked upstairs and...

28:49.920 --> 28:53.360
..my friend said, like, "Oh, how did
your goodbye go," kind of thing.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.800
Like, straightaway, I was, like,
in a really shitty mood.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.920
I was just, like, kicking myself.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.960
I wanted to tell you
exactly how I was feeling,

29:01.960 --> 29:03.480
and especially after that day,
and I just...

29:03.480 --> 29:05.480
..I...I just...

29:06.520 --> 29:08.240
..I guess I buckled.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.440
From day one,
I've always had feelings for you,

29:12.440 --> 29:14.680
and I've always thought that...

29:14.680 --> 29:17.800
..you could be
an incredible partner.

29:17.800 --> 29:22.120
Especially after home towns, I...

29:22.120 --> 29:24.000
..pictured a life with you,

29:24.000 --> 29:28.600
seeing you with my family,
like, having a day like today,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.120
being able to just, like,
laugh at each other,

29:30.120 --> 29:34.240
that makes me realise, like...

29:34.240 --> 29:35.720
..um, I'm in love with you.

29:36.920 --> 29:41.720
And I'm, like, so hopeful and
excited to see where this could go.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.480
Yeah.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.040
Oh.
(LAUGHS)

29:45.040 --> 29:46.280
Come here.

29:54.200 --> 30:00.560
Being with Jamie-Lee right now
makes me 100% believe in fate,

30:00.560 --> 30:02.960
to hear that she is in love with me.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.440
I can't even tell you how
reassuring, beautiful, nice it is.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.920
It's where I wanted to be.

30:14.640 --> 30:18.080
(LAUGHS) I don't know. I'm...
I'm definitely on cloud nine, yeah.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.040
Did I tell you that you're beautiful?

30:24.360 --> 30:26.000
You're so cute.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.960
JAMIE-LEE: I feel like
I actually might have a chance

30:30.960 --> 30:33.640
to be with Brooke.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.120
There's part of me
that's, like, "No," like,

30:35.120 --> 30:36.400
"don't get your hopes up,"

30:36.400 --> 30:39.760
but I'm confident in what we have.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.520
Thank you for today.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.920
Hopefully, there's much more.

30:45.920 --> 30:50.400
Maybe there's, like,
less bugs and stuff, though.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.400
(LAUGHS)

30:52.800 --> 30:55.360
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

31:10.320 --> 31:12.840
HOLLY: I am feeling so nervous.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.200
Things were left a bit up in the air
between Brooke and I

31:17.200 --> 31:18.760
after home towns.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.160
Is it true that you don't want kids?

31:22.160 --> 31:24.080
I want a small family.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.400
OK.
Yeah.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.040
HOLLY:
The children and the fact that...

31:27.040 --> 31:29.720
..she might want to move back to WA
with the family,

31:29.720 --> 31:32.080
they're big things
that need to be considered.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.720
You know, I've been to Melbourne.
I've...know the city.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.840
I can see myself there.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.480
Mmm.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.160
But I'm not sure
if I can see myself in WA.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.320
HOLLY:
So to see her get really upset,

31:45.320 --> 31:48.200
it makes ME really upset, because...

31:48.200 --> 31:50.960
..these issues don't subtract
from how I'm feeling about her.

31:50.960 --> 31:54.120
It just makes everything
really confusing.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.920
I've got
really strong feelings for her,

31:56.920 --> 32:00.120
and I want Brooke
to be a part of my life.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.280
So I've brought her to a place
that means quite a lot to me.

32:05.280 --> 32:10.320
I grew up dancing and was a ballet
dancer for over 15 years in my life,

32:10.320 --> 32:12.320
so I'm hoping
that mine and Brooke's connection

32:12.320 --> 32:15.360
can grow today through dance,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.240
kind of bring us back
to what we were.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.600
Hello!
Hi.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.280
Wow!

32:24.280 --> 32:26.360
Look at you!
Look at YOU!

32:26.360 --> 32:27.800
Look at those power boots.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.960
BROOKE:
Rocking up at Sydney Dance Company

32:29.960 --> 32:32.920
and seeing Holly's smiling face

32:32.920 --> 32:34.120
makes me so happy.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.680
Canadian tuxedo! I'm about it.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.720
Hello!
Hi.

32:37.720 --> 32:38.880
Oh, bring it in.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.120
But we both know
there's an elephant in the room.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.560
So, I know we have some things
to talk about.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.440
Yeah.
But I would like to give that the
time it deserves later in the day.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.800
OK.
And I have a few things planned.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.800
Love that.
Do you have any idea?

32:52.800 --> 32:55.320
(LAUGHS) It's pretty obvious.
(LAUGHS) Hmm. I wonder.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.040
Yeah.
It's something to do with dancing.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.200
Yeah.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.080
You know me as a cheerleader,

33:00.080 --> 33:03.400
but I was also a ballet dancer
for 15 years.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.480
Oh, my God!

33:04.480 --> 33:06.680
Um, and I think dancing is, like,
one of the greatest mediums

33:06.680 --> 33:08.960
of expressing how you feel.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.320
So...
Amazing.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.520
..I have a few surprises
here today for us.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.720
OK.
You ready?

33:13.720 --> 33:14.920
I'm excited.
Yeah?

33:14.920 --> 33:16.920
Yeah.
You got me on my toes, for sure.
Yay!

33:16.920 --> 33:19.040
HOLLY: I hope Brooke loves today.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.960
Dancing is such a huge part
of my life, so I really hope

33:21.960 --> 33:24.920
with Brooke being able to understand
ballet a little bit better,

33:24.920 --> 33:26.280
she'll be able to understand me.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.040
You look amazing.
Thanks.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.440
Yeah, I feel like...
Yeah.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.560
You walk differently when you...
..really, like, powerful...

33:31.560 --> 33:32.880
..wear a suit.
..in a suit, yeah.

33:32.880 --> 33:33.920
Yeah. Told you.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.240
It's the first time
I've, like, worn...

33:35.240 --> 33:36.880
It's like, today,
where I'm wearing denim,

33:36.880 --> 33:38.640
I feel like I should be, like,
doing, like, shimmy...

33:38.640 --> 33:40.360
These ones?
Yeah.
BOTH: Disco up, disco down.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.440
(BOTH LAUGH)

33:41.440 --> 33:43.360
I love going on dates with Holly.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.040
Every single date that I've had
with her has been really special.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.880
Ooh!

33:49.600 --> 33:52.720
So we're gonna come and take a seat.
OK.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.520
Oh! We've got this to ourselves.
We do.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.360
BROOKE: I feel like
I grow as a person with her.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.160
She really challenges me
and, like, puts me in scenarios

34:03.160 --> 34:05.400
that I'm not very used to.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.520
Well...
(LAUGHS)

34:06.520 --> 34:09.360
..have you ever seen
a ballet performance?

34:09.360 --> 34:13.160
I have never seen
a ballet performance, ever.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.880
Well...
This is exciting.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.160
..there's a first time
for everything.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.960
Thank you so much.
I'm so excited.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.440
I feel like
I'm always doing firsts with you.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.520
Oh, my God, I've got goose bumps.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.960
(GENTLE MUSIC)

34:35.680 --> 34:38.800
HOLLY: So this dance is about...

34:38.800 --> 34:41.720
..about, like,
intimacy between two people

34:41.720 --> 34:43.200
before they go for an embrace.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.480
Um, and...
Oh, I love that.

34:45.480 --> 34:48.360
..yeah, you'll see that,
like, throughout the performance,

34:48.360 --> 34:52.280
they, like, rarely touch, until...

34:52.280 --> 34:54.120
..at the very end -
they just kind of explore

34:54.120 --> 34:56.480
each other's space and...

34:57.840 --> 34:58.880
..connection.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.000
It's so beautiful.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.120
And this is actually

35:16.120 --> 35:18.320
usually between a man and a woman

35:18.320 --> 35:20.360
and they changed it for us today.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.800
It's amazing.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.840
Wow. It's just so beautiful.

35:33.040 --> 35:37.120
BROOKE: I got a little bit,
like, a lump in my throat, because...

35:37.120 --> 35:42.480
..the intimacy between two women,
it's powerful.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.280
It's so emotional,
it feels very loving,

35:45.280 --> 35:50.040
and I can't help but draw parallels
between Holly and I.

35:55.240 --> 35:59.400
Right now, Holly and I
are in a little bit of a limbo.

35:59.400 --> 36:04.720
I think our relationship has
kind of taken us somewhere, and...

36:04.720 --> 36:07.760
..I want it to kind of get back
to where it was before.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.080
I think
she's the most beautiful girl,

36:15.080 --> 36:18.640
and I would be really lucky.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.480
I'm just hoping
that we can get past this.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
OSHER: Want the inside scoop?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.040
only on 10 play.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.600
HOLLY: Welcome to my humble abode.
(LAUGHS)

36:59.600 --> 37:02.160
BROOKE: As magical
as today has been with Holly,

37:02.160 --> 37:05.480
I am a little bit anxious
about the next part of this day,

37:05.480 --> 37:09.160
because there are some tough
questions that we need to talk about.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.920
How'd you find today?
It was a very intimate dance.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.160
Yeah. I absolutely loved it.
I thought it was really special.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.160
Yeah. Bonachela is...

37:16.160 --> 37:18.680
I'm so glad that I got to, like,
see that with you.

37:18.680 --> 37:19.920
Yeah.
It was really nice.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.680
HOLLY: Brooke and I have some...

37:22.680 --> 37:25.240
..big issues to discuss tonight.

37:25.240 --> 37:28.600
I don't want to live in WA
to raise a family

37:28.600 --> 37:31.440
and I don't want
three children, so...

37:31.440 --> 37:32.840
..yeah, my heart is in my throat.

37:32.840 --> 37:36.520
It's...not a fun conversation
to be entering,

37:36.520 --> 37:43.320
and...I really don't know what the
outcome of this chat is going to be.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.520
I know, though,
when we started the date, you were...

37:45.520 --> 37:47.480
..you said
there's a couple of things...

37:47.480 --> 37:50.920
Mmm.
..that you wanted to talk about,
but you wanted to enjoy the date...

37:50.920 --> 37:52.440
Yeah.
..which I absolutely did.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.680
Um...I've got a couple of questions.

37:54.680 --> 37:55.760
Um...

37:55.760 --> 37:58.720
..the first one would be...

37:59.840 --> 38:02.400
..what...
at home towns left you hurt,

38:02.400 --> 38:04.440
'cause I know
that's definitely not how...

38:04.440 --> 38:05.440
Yeah.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.000
..I would have wanted to...
to leave things.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.600
Yeah. I get what...yeah.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.400
(CLEARS THROAT) Um...

38:11.400 --> 38:12.480
..I... (SIGHS)

38:12.480 --> 38:16.240
..like, I've always had feelings

38:16.240 --> 38:19.320
from the start with you, because...

38:19.320 --> 38:20.640
..I don't know, I... (LAUGHS)

38:20.640 --> 38:22.680
..this way that
you made me feel on the red carpet

38:22.680 --> 38:25.680
and it was like our first date and...

38:25.680 --> 38:27.360
..Holly, like, you're amazing.

38:27.360 --> 38:31.560
So I was, like, "I like this girl.
She's consistent."

38:31.560 --> 38:32.960
Mmm.
"She's fun."

38:32.960 --> 38:34.480
You've been
one of my strongest connections.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.120
Yeah.
I've never, ever doubted you
or questioned you.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.600
But at home towns...
Mm-hm.

38:40.600 --> 38:44.000
..there was
just so many unanswered questions,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.240
and then hearing them...

38:45.240 --> 38:48.120
..not from you but from your mum...
Mmm.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.360
..I felt hurt because I was, like,

38:50.360 --> 38:52.920
"Oh, my God! Have I got this
completely and utterly wrong?"

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
Yeah.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.040
What...

38:55.040 --> 38:56.960
..were the things that came up?

38:56.960 --> 38:58.880
Uh, the kids.

38:58.880 --> 39:02.520
Yep.
You...want to have one or none?

39:02.520 --> 39:05.840
I...have been single now
for, like, three and a half years,

39:05.840 --> 39:09.360
and in that time, when I think about
my future, I had been on my own,

39:09.360 --> 39:13.320
so I was, like, I don't have kids
in my future, 'cause I am...single.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.320
I don't...
Mmm.

39:14.320 --> 39:19.400
..wouldn't want to start a family
just as myself, if that makes sense.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.400
Mmm.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.560
But then...when I came here

39:22.560 --> 39:25.120
and I'm thinking about
a future with you,

39:25.120 --> 39:26.880
I do picture a family.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.240
Yep.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.840
But for me,
that is a smaller family.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.600
Yeah.
And it's probably only one.

39:34.600 --> 39:39.280
Is it not a huge priority for you
in your life?

39:39.280 --> 39:40.880
Children?
Yeah.
No.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.000
BROOKE: This is, like, devastating.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.720
One or none is a big deal.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.800
Like, I want three.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.080
I thought that I had
communicated that quite thoroughly

39:51.080 --> 39:52.880
throughout this experience.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.760
I've always been really honest
with everyone from the get-go,

39:55.760 --> 40:00.080
and kids is really important,
like, having my own family.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.520
There was a little moment,
some little things

40:02.520 --> 40:04.880
that I kind of threw out
to all of you on a group date...

40:04.880 --> 40:07.080
Mmm.
..that I want to have three children.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.840
I want to have two children.
I want to have them my own.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.400
Mmm.
And I would love to adopt.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.880
It was in and out of foster homes.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.520
I'd like to basically
give another kid an opportunity.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.680
I...mmm...

40:16.680 --> 40:20.680
..did...I honestly
didn't intentionally disguise that,

40:20.680 --> 40:25.200
but I don't think, in hindsight,
I have gone into as much detail...

40:25.200 --> 40:27.280
Yeah.
..as I probably could have.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.320
Um...

40:28.320 --> 40:31.960
..the other conversation
that I had with your mum

40:31.960 --> 40:35.520
was this idea
that I was going back to Perth

40:35.520 --> 40:37.760
and that's where
I was gonna be, like, locked in.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.320
Mmm.
I'm gonna assume
that that's what you thought.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.320
Well...

40:41.320 --> 40:45.400
..when you mentioned
that you wanted to move back to WA,

40:45.400 --> 40:47.120
I was, like, "Oh,
that's the first I've heard of it."

40:47.120 --> 40:50.800
And, I guess, for me,
I don't want you to think

40:50.800 --> 40:52.880
that I thought you were
withholding that information.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.360
For me, it was just, oh, these are
things that come out with time,

40:56.360 --> 40:58.040
and this just
happens to be the time...

40:58.040 --> 41:01.040
..the first time
that you've spoken that to me.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.880
I think... (SIGHS)

41:04.880 --> 41:07.560
..that conversation was kind of,
like, a huge miscommunication.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.600
Like...
Yeah.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.400
Currently, I live in Melbourne.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.120
Yeah.
Perth is just, like,
something that I threw out...

41:13.120 --> 41:14.400
Yeah.
..that it could be an option...

41:14.400 --> 41:15.840
Yeah...
..like, later on.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.080
And I've always felt like
it's something that we...

41:18.080 --> 41:19.080
..discuss as a partner.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.720
Yep.
Do you get what I mean?
Yep.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.120
Just throwing it out there, though,
like, if that was a case where I felt

41:23.120 --> 41:26.640
like I needed to go home
and I wanted to be home for a bit...

41:27.840 --> 41:30.640
..what would happen
in that situation, like...?

41:30.640 --> 41:31.720
Um...

41:31.720 --> 41:35.800
..WA is not...honestly, not
somewhere where I can see myself.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.560
So that's where...

41:39.560 --> 41:43.240
..compromise
then becomes a sacrifice.

41:43.240 --> 41:45.160
Do you think that's what I'm...?
No. No, no, no.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.360
No.
I don't...I don't think...
like, that's what I mean.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.480
I don't think that you would
expect me to sacrifice things.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.120
No, but I would...
And I wouldn't expect you to...

41:52.120 --> 41:54.760
..want to know that...

41:54.760 --> 41:55.800
..my partner's, like, open...

41:55.800 --> 41:57.120
Yeah.
..minded...
Yeah.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.600
..and can be open
about these things...
Yep.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.000
..because...

42:00.000 --> 42:02.560
..I just know within my own heart,

42:02.560 --> 42:04.400
like, if my partner
wanted me to go somewhere

42:04.400 --> 42:06.360
'cause they needed to be at home,

42:06.360 --> 42:07.600
like, if the shoe
was on the other foot

42:07.600 --> 42:09.680
and you were from WA
and needed to go home to Sydney,

42:09.680 --> 42:11.800
I just know that I would compromise.

42:11.800 --> 42:15.120
But I just want to know
that in a relationship,

42:15.120 --> 42:16.880
you're willing to even
just, like, meet me halfway.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.360
The reason why I came here
was to find someone

42:19.360 --> 42:21.400
that would be willing
to meet me halfway.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.560
Yeah.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.480
I'm not sure.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.560
You're not sure?

42:28.560 --> 42:30.040
I'm not sure.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.600
BROOKE:
Feels like a stab in the heart.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.280
Um...

42:40.280 --> 42:43.320
BROOKE: I thought we would be
much stronger than that.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.480
Yeah, I'm just a little bit lost.

42:44.480 --> 42:47.480
I don't know where to...like,
kind of go from this. Like, it's...

42:51.360 --> 42:52.520
I feel like you meet in the middle.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.880
If you love someone,
you meet them in the middle.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.040
And she's not willing
to meet me halfway.

42:57.040 --> 43:01.480
Whether that changes or not, I'm not
sure, and I can't say for certain.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.200
I just don't want to
not voice what I'm feeling now

43:04.200 --> 43:08.400
and then it be an issue
in the future.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.680
Yeah.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.480
To be honest, like,
part of me is just, like,

43:14.480 --> 43:17.520
"Why couldn't you
just tell me this earlier?"

43:17.520 --> 43:21.320
I've always had strong feelings...
I have strong feelings for you.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.320
So this is hurting me, like...
Yeah.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.960
..knowing that you're not willing
to compromise

43:24.960 --> 43:27.160
any of those things for me
in some way.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.560
So we're at a roadblock.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.200
You're not...you're not telling me
that we can get over this hill.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.840
You're just basically telling me
that we're here

43:32.840 --> 43:34.920
and we're not moving forward.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.560
That's not my intention
for this conversation.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.960
Well, what do you want me to do?

43:38.960 --> 43:40.480
Where do we see each other
going from here?

43:40.480 --> 43:44.000
Look, I'm honestly...I don't know,
because I'm...I'm torn,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
because I really like you.

43:48.280 --> 43:51.480
But I feel like
the next, like, few years

43:51.480 --> 43:53.440
would be really, really wonderful.

43:54.440 --> 43:59.080
And then after that,
I'm not so sure about.

44:03.080 --> 44:05.000
OK.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.400
Yep.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.520
Mmm.

44:13.720 --> 44:17.080
I just want to know, like,
what were you looking for originally?

44:17.080 --> 44:18.640
Like, you came into this experience.
Yeah.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.800
And what were you
looking for originally?

44:20.800 --> 44:23.640
I'm looking
to spend my life with someone.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.600
But it's not me,
'cause you're only saying...

44:25.600 --> 44:27.720
..you're giving me a time limit.

44:27.720 --> 44:30.320
It's, like...

44:31.560 --> 44:35.680
..I don't really put a number on how
many years I'm gonna be with someone.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.840
I...
I generally put a lifetime.

44:37.840 --> 44:40.200
And that's why I came into this.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.360
But you're already putting, like,
a bit of a time line on me.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.720
Like, how am I meant to feel?

44:44.720 --> 44:45.840
My intention isn't...

44:45.840 --> 44:49.920
..to hurt, never been to hurt.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.280
I'm just...you know...

44:54.360 --> 44:57.160
I don't know where to go from here.

44:57.160 --> 45:00.200
If you're already
pre-empting us for that,

45:00.200 --> 45:02.480
you're already setting us up
for failure.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.520
You're already going
straight to the issue,

45:04.520 --> 45:08.480
not what we potentially could have
and what we could work together on.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.400
You're basically saying,
"This is gonna hit a roadblock.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.960
"We're gonna end at that time."

45:12.960 --> 45:14.480
Are you willing to compromise,

45:14.480 --> 45:16.840
are you willing to go together
in the same direction,

45:16.840 --> 45:19.560
or are you kind of, like,
"Well, this is it, this is it.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.080
"Cut it. Move on"?

45:22.080 --> 45:23.680
Well, is that
what you're trying to say?

45:25.040 --> 45:28.480
I...didn't realise until home towns
it was a non-negotiable,

45:28.480 --> 45:30.960
otherwise
I would have brought it up sooner.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960

45:33.040 --> 45:34.680

get over this hill.

I was really looking forward
to getting over this hill

45:36.520 --> 45:39.200
and just letting things
just kind of...

45:40.560 --> 45:43.280
I'm...I...
I'm a very compromising person.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.360
Mmm.
I'd be willing to compromise, like...
moving to Sydney.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.360
I would be...

45:47.360 --> 45:49.840
Yeah.
..I would pack my life up tomorrow.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.200
And...I would do the same.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.840
I just...
But only on conditions.

45:54.840 --> 45:58.520
And I didn't come here to fall
in love, like, on conditions, right?

45:58.520 --> 46:02.120
I came here to find love,
love unconditional.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.600
Do you get what I'm saying?
Yeah.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.600
I'm hurt because you're...you're
putting conditions on a relationship

46:06.600 --> 46:08.080
that hasn't even, like, excelled,

46:08.080 --> 46:11.240
it hasn't even
got out of this...this bubble.

46:11.240 --> 46:16.560
Do you know how much that just takes
me back to previous relationships

46:16.560 --> 46:20.320

"Oh, I love you, but..."?

51:10.080 --> 51:13.680
DARVID: If Brooke doesn't choose me,
I will be heartbroken.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.760
JAMIE-LEE:
It's all I've ever wanted, is her,

51:15.760 --> 51:19.240
and now I'm here and I'm so close.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.720
..when Brooke's destiny
is finally revealed.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.680
BROOKE:
I'm really and utterly in love.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.520
I'm so madly in love.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.520
