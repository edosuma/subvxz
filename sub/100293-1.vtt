13:28.600 --> 13:31.680
C: All of the assassinated
agents were investigating

13:31.760 --> 13:33.840
leads relating to this man.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.680
Daniel Barton.
Born in Bromsgrove.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.560
Now lives
just north of San Francisco.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.480
- He's the founder of VOR.
- The search engine.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.320
Web apps, social,
global mapping, advertising,

13:46.400 --> 13:48.520
scientific
and medical research,

13:48.600 --> 13:49.800
robotics, data polling,

13:49.880 --> 13:51.520
human analytics...

13:51.600 --> 13:55.360
Right now, VOR is more powerful
than most nations.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.320
Daniel Barton is the man

13:57.400 --> 13:59.680
who built it all up
from the ground.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.560
We're going to need
your best man on this.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.440
What do you call him?
Horizon-watcher?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.880
Oh.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.400
- Exactly.
- Well, he...um...

14:07.480 --> 14:09.320
He left.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.320
I...sacked him.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.080
The only person with
an open mind about all this

14:13.160 --> 14:14.120
and you let him go?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.920
MI6 has never countenanced

14:17.000 --> 14:19.480
the possibility
of extraterrestrial life.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.200
Well, you should talk
to your mates at GCHQ!

14:22.280 --> 14:24.320
The country
has other organisations

14:24.400 --> 14:25.760
that deal with all that!

14:25.840 --> 14:27.760
UNIT. Even Torchwood.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.320
They're all gone.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.920
Oh, C! You took your eye
off the horizon

14:32.000 --> 14:33.840
just as things
were coming over it.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.400
Don't worry. I'll call him.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.600
You can't. He's off-grid.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.320
We can't find him anywhere.
Believe me, we've tried.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.600
Shh. I'm WhatsApping.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.720
Hi. It's me.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.640
I'm at MI6 with C. Crisis.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.280
Big crisis.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.680
Serious crisis.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.400
Big, serious crisis.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.600
And C says you were right and
he's sorry for being an idiot.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.120
I did not use those words!

14:56.200 --> 14:58.280
Send us your location. Kisses.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.280
It's quite French, that,
isn't it?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.520
- Kisses?
- [PHONE PINGS]

15:01.600 --> 15:02.760
Ah!

15:02.840 --> 15:04.400
- See?
- C: Yes?

15:05.960 --> 15:07.280
- It's a fish.
- I know!

15:07.360 --> 15:09.720
Can we please focus?
Daniel Barton

15:09.800 --> 15:11.840
isn't just
a powerful businessman.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.360
He was also one of our agents

15:13.440 --> 15:15.480
when he first went
to work in the US.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.760
Then he withdrew cooperation.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.680
It's possible
he became a double agent.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.200
- Or even a triple.
- Who for?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.320
- W...

Agh!

15:55.640 --> 15:57.840
DOCTOR: We've got
to get out of here.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.400
GRAHAM: We've still got
the gadgets.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.560
We just saw the head of MI6
get assassinated.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.560
Yeah, by the same sort of bolts
that came through that sat nav.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.120
Where's that picture?
I need to set the coordinates.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.960
Ooh, I've got it.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.320
So, wrong place, wrong time
twice in one day.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.960
That's got to make us targets.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.920
And why do you keep looking
at pictures of a fish?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.120
Steganography.
There's another image

16:18.200 --> 16:20.360
hidden within the pixels
of that photo.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.920
It's basic spycraft
in your time.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.040
Easy way to smuggle out
information

16:23.120 --> 16:25.280
because there's
no pattern to look for.

- [CRACKING]
- No two stegs are the same.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.440
RYAN: So one's hidden
inside the other?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.080
- Doc.
- Exactly.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.000
Luckily, I can read pixels.
I took a correspondence class.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.320
- Doc...
- Ooh, the outback.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.520
Gone full hermit.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.680
Doctor,
something's trying to get in!

[BUZZING AND THRUMMING STOP]

16:57.040 --> 16:59.640
I didn't know things could get
into the TARDIS like that.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.280
Neither did I.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.840
RYAN: But you got rid of it.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.640
GRAHAM: Yeah, but what was it?

17:05.720 --> 17:09.400
At a guess, the same thing
that attacked all those spies.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.480
- And possibly us.
- [SONIC BLOOPS]

17:11.560 --> 17:12.840

read everything.

All right, park that.

but we need intel.

Split resources. Graham,
me and you are off to Australia

17:27.720 --> 17:29.640
to see my old mate
from MI6. I say old mate -

17:29.720 --> 17:31.520
I've met him once,
but he seemed very nice.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.800
We text, though.
Does that count?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.200
- If you say so.
- Yaz, Ryan,

17:34.280 --> 17:36.040
how do you feel
about undercover work?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.360
- Definitely!
- I don't know.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.800
Daniel Barton -
he's our best lead.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.360
Well, he's our only lead.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.440
We'll get you a cover story.
Hack his diary, get in there,

17:46.520 --> 17:48.720
check him out. Infiltrate VOR.
Have a nose

17:48.800 --> 17:50.880
- around their systems.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.800

with absolutely no training?

17:54.880 --> 17:57.480
- We got the gadgets.
- All the gear, but no idea.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.120
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- No, I think you'll be great.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.680
I have total confidence,
you know?

18:01.760 --> 18:03.240
Just, um...

18:03.320 --> 18:05.440
Just be careful, though.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.800
It's safe for them, though,
right?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.320
Yeah. 80% sure.

about Daniel Barton.

Like Graham said, be careful.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.880
Stay in touch.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.600
And remember,
rule 1 of espionage -

18:24.680 --> 18:26.720
trust no-one.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.400

18:36.880 --> 18:38.920
- Which building is it?
- That one there.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.200
Though according to the files,

18:40.280 --> 18:41.600
this whole development
is down to Barton.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.840
So, you journalist,
me photographer?

18:44.920 --> 18:47.120
Yeah. That works, doesn't it?

18:47.200 --> 18:48.760
I reckon.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.680
We've just got to try and be
confident with it, haven't we?

18:50.760 --> 18:52.640
Try not to panic that
we're blagging our way in

18:52.720 --> 18:54.400
on someone
who might be dangerous.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.480
And don't obsess on
our total lack of spy training.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.000
Yeah. Don't obsess on that.

the Doctor would do it.

We can do this.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.920
Why are you looking so worried?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.960
I decided my spy name would be
Logan, and now I'm worried

19:11.040 --> 19:12.800
I don't look anything
like Hugh Jackman.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.720
Ryan, you're panicking.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.040
Rule 1 - no panicking.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.800
I thought rule 1 was
don't trust anybody!

19:17.880 --> 19:19.240
Rule 1a, then - no panicking

19:19.320 --> 19:20.760
while you're not
trusting anyone!

19:24.600 --> 19:26.920

- I'm Logan.

- It was a joke

20:51.800 --> 20:53.320
by the others at MI6.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.400
Whenever I came into the room
to meet C,

20:55.480 --> 20:57.320
he'd go, "Oh, God!"

Oh!

20:58.840 --> 21:01.960
It sort of stuck,
and now I've ownedit.

You're right, I do.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.160
Didn't realise you were
this much of a hoarder.

What is all this stuff?

21:41.360 --> 21:44.160
The full MI6 record
of the unexplained.

of unidentified objects,

I gathered.

Does this connect
to the attacks on agents?

22:20.880 --> 22:23.040
I have been monitoring
the chatter, Doctor.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.360
Is it aliens?

22:26.440 --> 22:30.080
Aliens attacking spies
all over the world?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.760
And rewriting their DNA.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.000
That's terrifying. But...

22:34.080 --> 22:36.400
- Wow! Why would they do that?
- I don't know.

They almost infiltrated my
TARDIS as we were taking off.

have something

22:40.360 --> 22:43.280
in your research banks
that might give us some clues.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.560
No. I prefer cautious.

if anything's watching me.

And if you're already
in the middle of all of this,

22:54.360 --> 22:57.360
how do you know
they won't follow you here?

22:57.440 --> 22:59.360
How do you know
you haven't become targets too?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.720
