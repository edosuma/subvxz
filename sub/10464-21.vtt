WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:08.025
Hey, hey, hey.

00:08.048 --> 00:09.402
Working hard, I see.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.736
Joe! God, Joe!

00:10.760 --> 00:12.770
- Joe, you're back.
- Yeah, I'm back.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.198
Wow!

00:14.222 --> 00:16.117
Will you look at this place?

00:16.140 --> 00:18.035
- Holy cow!
- Thanks.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.862
Um, yeah, I told you about...
What are you doing back?

00:20.979 --> 00:21.997
Charlie, where's your head?

00:22.021 --> 00:23.165
I gave you my schedule.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.324
I told you I was gonna be
here for a couple of weeks.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.627
It's a good thing too

00:26.651 --> 00:30.288
because I think we might
have a little problem.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.424
Certified mail?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.676
It's nothing to panic about,

00:33.700 --> 00:35.835
but that bastard Montgomery,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.087
he's finally decided
to sell the building.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.141
Oh, right. Right.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.935
He, uh, he mentioned
something about that.

00:42.959 --> 00:43.936
Yeah?

00:43.960 --> 00:47.013
Did he tell you about the buyer,
this Isley Financial Group?

00:47.380 --> 00:48.357
Not really.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.360
Uh, he pretty much just said
he was gonna accept the offer.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.528
Charlie, our lease
is up in June,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.645
so we gotta figure out
what their plans are.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.866
I-I don't know.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.453
Ah, you know, they probably
just want to jack up the rent

01:00.477 --> 01:02.496
and gouge us for whatever
they can get away with,

01:02.520 --> 01:05.239
but hey, we can handle it, right?
Huh?

01:05.440 --> 01:08.294
I mean, it wouldn't make sense
for them to boot us now.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.204
Look what you have
done with this place.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.044
Your old man would be proud.

So... So wait a second.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.165
So now Saturday's out too?

01:56.241 --> 01:59.053
Well, yeah, we got this call
from this girl at Central High.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.305
And the lead singer of the band
that was supposed to perform

02:01.329 --> 02:03.641
for their spring dance, I guess
came down with mono or something,

02:03.665 --> 02:05.810
so they needed a replacement,
we needed a gig,

02:05.834 --> 02:07.645
so Matt booked it. Sorry.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.145
No, no, no. You don't
have to be sorry.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.815
I mean, you guys are taking off.
And that's...

02:10.839 --> 02:12.191
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.017
Oh, you know what? I can't
meet you for lunch.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.363
I've gotta Xerox
copies of sheet music,

02:17.387 --> 02:19.281
but we can see each
other between classes.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.574
And after school.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.659
Uh, rehearsal.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.077
But you're gonna
come tonight, right?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.578
I know it's at the
coffeehouse again,

02:24.602 --> 02:26.038
but we can hang between sets.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.363
Um...

02:28.022 --> 02:30.584
Actually, I'm starting to
feel a little like Yoko Ono,

02:30.608 --> 02:33.077
so I think I might just
catch a movie with Will.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.214
Oh. Oh, right.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.716
It's kind of silly for you to be
there every single night, anyway.

02:37.740 --> 02:38.875
Yeah.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.252
So I won't see you until...

02:42.203 --> 02:43.639
Wow, until tomorrow.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.923
No, between classes, remember?

02:46.374 --> 02:47.518
Gotta go.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.759
Love you.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.387
Yeah.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.097
I love you too.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.733
Are you avoiding me?

02:54.757 --> 02:55.651
No, of course not.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.862
'Cause you haven't called me
the last couple of nights.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.405
Well, I've been busy.
So, I mean...

02:59.429 --> 03:04.743
And I guess I can understand
that 'cause I haven't been...

03:04.767 --> 03:05.703
I mean, I know I haven't been

03:05.727 --> 03:08.163
the most pleasant person
to be around lately.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.248
And...

03:09.272 --> 03:10.489
I'm sorry.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.670
And I've been thinking about
what you said about us

03:14.694 --> 03:18.664
needing to do stuff together,
and you were right.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.710
We need to do something
different and fun and

03:23.578 --> 03:24.555
different,

03:24.579 --> 03:29.508
so, um, I found this ad for
a class at SF Community.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.687
Available-Light Photography?

03:31.711 --> 03:34.148
Twice a week for
six weeks, and...

03:34.172 --> 03:35.316
you're already into photography,

03:35.340 --> 03:37.225
so you can show me
some of the basics.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.770
What?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.147
I thought I told you.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.200
Told me what?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.285
About the project
at the station.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.737
I'm going to be working the next
two weeks straight through.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.323
I'm pretty sure that I told you.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.410
Oh. I guess I must
have just forgotten.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.788
Sorry.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.083
No. No, that's okay.
I understand.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.837
So you think I can
borrow your camera?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.758
Okay, what do you want
first, <i>Seventeen</i> or <i>Sassy?</i>

04:10.833 --> 04:13.896
I copped my own, thank you,
while you were yammering.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.555
Jody, I can't believe that...

04:15.713 --> 04:17.055
<i>Playgirl?</i>

04:17.339 --> 04:19.026
Wow, check him out.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.392
Cute butt.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.395
I don't know. You
like chest hair?

04:22.720 --> 04:26.492
Well, I haven't really given
it that much thought.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.817
Oh, my God. It's him.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.069
- Him who?
- Jim Trowell, the new guy.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.572
He's a major babe.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.823
You think?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.042
Hello?

04:35.066 --> 04:36.826
What planet are you on?

04:37.443 --> 04:38.921
Oh, my God. He's
coming over here.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.371
Be cas, okay?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.709
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.137
Oh, my God.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.171
Did you hear the
way he said that?

04:55.461 --> 04:56.846
There's a catch.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.806
Excuse me?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.401
This little thing right here?

05:00.425 --> 05:02.278
You gotta press it and
then lift this up.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.946
Ah, thanks.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.229
Sure.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.584
Don't take this the
wrong way or anything,

05:17.608 --> 05:20.578
but have you actually ever
used a camera before?

05:20.695 --> 05:21.954
Hm?

05:22.363 --> 05:23.706
You forgot the lens.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.500
Oh!

05:28.661 --> 05:30.681
Uh, the beginning class
meets on Mondays.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.141
- This is...
- Available light.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.225
Yeah, I know.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.601
I was actually
supposed to take this

05:34.625 --> 05:36.478
with someone who's been
doing it for a while,

05:36.502 --> 05:38.981
but they bailed at the
last minute, so...

05:39.005 --> 05:41.275
Well, it's not like I'm
an old pro or anything,

05:41.299 --> 05:42.558
but, uh...

05:43.426 --> 05:44.894
if you need any help,

05:45.053 --> 05:46.479
I'm Ian.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.023
Julia.

05:52.810 --> 05:53.986
This looks heavy.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.998
So when do we get roadies?

05:56.022 --> 05:57.740
Hey, you guys need
a hand with that?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.961
Oh, hey, thanks. A miracle.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.129
Yeah, sure.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.246
- Okay.
- Thanks.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.890
Can you guys, like, you know,
spare a couple of bucks?

06:12.914 --> 06:15.174
Yeah, I've got some change in my purse.
Hold on a sec.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.594
I don't want your change.
Gimme your wallet.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.189
- Okay, um... - Come on!
Give me your wallet!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.816
Okay. Look, bro, I've got, like, 30 bucks.
Just take it easy.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.485
Just take it easy. Don't
hurt anybody. Okay?

06:24.509 --> 06:26.028
Just walk away, all right?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.154
Let me have your purse!

06:27.178 --> 06:28.322
Purse! Let me have the purse!

06:28.346 --> 06:29.490
Sarah, give him the purse.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.689
Sarah, give him...

06:31.349 --> 06:32.942
What is the matter
with you, bitch?

06:44.946 --> 06:46.789
So I called Montgomery, right?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.416
What?

06:48.449 --> 06:50.135
To see if these Isley
Financial guys

06:50.159 --> 06:52.471
wanted to come to the
place for dinner and...

06:52.495 --> 06:53.921
Why would you do that?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.132
To wine and dine them, to
see what their plans are.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.601
So anyway, he calls me back,

06:57.625 --> 07:00.136
and he tells me that
they're not interested.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.388
Now, what do you
suppose that means?

07:02.421 --> 07:04.066
It probably means that they
don't want to have dinner.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.609
No. Uh-uh.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.977
I-I think something's up.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.822
So Emmett gave me the names...

07:09.846 --> 07:11.281
Joe, why are you pushing this?

07:11.305 --> 07:12.699
Because I want to make damn sure

07:12.723 --> 07:15.025
we don't lose this
place, Charlie.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.820
Right.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.623
Right. You're right.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.834
That'd be terrible.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.744
That'd be bad, but I mean...

07:25.403 --> 07:26.912
Okay, what if we do?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.133
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

07:29.157 --> 07:30.801
I mean, we could always
find another location.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.012
Another location? What the hell are
you talking about, another location?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.305
Especially coming from you.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.057
This is your father's place.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.632
This is Salinger's.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.643
Hey, Joe!

07:39.667 --> 07:41.019
Hey. Look who's here.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.104
- Hey, Joe.
- Hi.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.188
- How you doing?
- Good.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.189
Good to see you.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.275
Oh, wow, this is perfect
because we have a surprise,

07:46.299 --> 07:48.110
and it's actually for
the both of you.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.935
So close your eyes.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.156
I'm kind of busy here, Claud.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.148
Hey, come on, we went
out of our way here.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.775
Come on. Close your eyes.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.198
Ta-da!

08:03.107 --> 08:04.784
Oh, wow!

08:05.526 --> 08:07.411
We had the review perma-plaqued.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.465
We figured you guys could
hang it out front.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.632
Oh, yeah.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.176
"Reinventing a classic."

08:12.200 --> 08:13.417
Not bad.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.596
Funny. Um...

08:15.620 --> 08:17.296
Is this the same Kathleen Isley?

08:17.788 --> 08:19.266
I don't know. Who's
Kathleen Isley?

08:19.290 --> 08:20.633
One of Charlie's women.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.095
Bailey! Bay.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.848
Can I talk to you, like now?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.322
What? What's going on?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.405
I don't know.

08:34.429 --> 08:35.698
Dana called, okay.

08:35.722 --> 08:37.534
And I don't know how serious
it is or anything, but...

08:37.558 --> 08:38.702
What?

08:38.726 --> 08:40.328
Matt and Sarah were robbed

08:40.352 --> 08:42.246
in the alley behind
the coffeehouse.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.572
What?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.209
Is, is Sarah okay?

08:45.233 --> 08:47.377
All I know, all Dana said was,

08:47.401 --> 08:49.411
they were both in
the emergency room.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.872
The emergency room?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.875
Uh, come on.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.513
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.847
Are you...

08:58.871 --> 09:01.549
Are you telling me that
you dumped this woman?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.804
You want to tell me what
the hell's going on here?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.742
- Coming through!
- Sarah?

09:18.766 --> 09:21.151
- Get out of the way. Watch the lines.
- Sarah.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.163
Excuse me. Excuse me.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.289
I'm looking for a Sarah Reeves.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.407
She was probably just admitted.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.835
No, I don't see that name.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.171
That's impossible. She was
brought in like a half hour ago.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.297
She was mugged.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.873
Do you know if she
was conscious?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.801
Because we wouldn't
have her name if...

09:35.825 --> 09:37.543
- Bay.
- What does she look like?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.878
Sarah.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.504
Sarah, hey.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.339
My God, are you okay?

09:43.541 --> 09:44.518
He hurt you.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.769
No, I'm okay.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.604
I came with Matt. He's
getting stitches.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.471
- But I'm okay.
- What happened?

09:49.755 --> 09:52.943
This guy, he had a knife,
and I couldn't move,

09:52.967 --> 09:54.069
and he grabbed me,

09:54.093 --> 09:56.020
- and then Matt tried to stop him...
- Hey.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.939
Seven stitches.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.816
Tetanus shot hurt
more, actually.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.286
God, I should have
been with you.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.704
Maybe if I was with you...

10:03.728 --> 10:05.863
Maybe if you'd been there, you'd
have been cut too, you know.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.365
It's not like you could
have done anything anyway.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.210
Hey.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.005
Hey, it's all right, okay?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.204
You're okay, now.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.749
Yeah, it's just still
kind of scary.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.126
I know, but it's over.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.838
Besides, now we kind of got a
cool story to tell, right?

10:23.205 --> 10:25.309
I don't know, maybe we can
write a song about this,

10:25.333 --> 10:26.884
turn it into something good.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.679
<i>Dr. Frazer. Dr. Sean Frazer...</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:33.066
She's gonna take it away?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.985
H-how could she
just take it away?

10:35.009 --> 10:37.696
God, Charlie, what could you have
possibly done to make her do this?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.948
I mean, it's our name.
It's our restaurant.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.116
I didn't do anything.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.242
You have to fix this, Charlie.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.368
You have to stop her!

10:43.392 --> 10:45.027
I can't, all right?

10:45.519 --> 10:46.779
I tried.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.697
I tried, but she won't listen.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.991
Tried what? What's going on?

10:51.025 --> 10:53.462
Kathleen is buying the restaurant
to get back at Charlie.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.662
It's gone.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.247
Gone? What do you mean gone?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.509
It's not my fault, okay?
It's not.

10:59.533 --> 11:00.719
It is your fault, Charlie.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.346
You're the one who got
involved with her.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.805
Listen to me, you guys.
It's not.

11:03.829 --> 11:07.476
I-I just... I ended
it, that's all.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.885
She was in love with me, and I
didn't want to lead her on.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.772
I did the right thing,

11:11.796 --> 11:13.690
and I had no way of knowing
that she was going to do this.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.192
Wait a second. Help
me out here, Charlie.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.651
You lose Dad's restaurant,

11:16.675 --> 11:19.071
and then you try and tell us
that it's not your fault?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.480
I'm sorry, but how the hell
is that not your fault?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.817
I can't believe you did this.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.902
I mean, even you.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.746
Come on, will you please just...

11:49.542 --> 11:50.894
Wow.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.938
Portrait of the artist
as a very sad person.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.940
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.525
I must have gone somewhere.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.027
Well, you better come back,
start wasting some film.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.570
Uh, I'll get a shot of you.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.197
No, no, no, no.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.532
We're doing candids,

12:03.556 --> 12:06.952
um, like... Like... There,

12:06.976 --> 12:08.286
the unknown Gabor sister.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.570
Ah.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.540
Now, start on F6,

12:11.564 --> 12:13.490
work your way down
in half-stops, okay?

12:14.108 --> 12:15.909
And hurry up. She's
almost out of the light.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.333
Come on. You're
going to miss her.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.127
Just point and shoot.
You're all set.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.965
Whoa, whoa. She's over there.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.800
What are you shooting?

12:34.128 --> 12:35.471
What's wrong?

12:35.629 --> 12:37.315
Uh, nothing.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.141
I just think I know that guy.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.101
Oh, really? Is he a
friend of yours?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.854
No. He's just someone
who goes to my school.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.284
Uh, anyway, uh, we should
get back to the lab.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.193
You can show me how
to print these up.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.527
Yeah.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.038
Wait a minute.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.498
- A beeper?
- Yeah.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.791
- Are you kidding me?
- No. I'm not.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.669
See, this way, whenever
you leave to go to a gig,

12:57.693 --> 12:59.337
you can page me, and
punch in a one.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.580
And then when you get there, you
page me and punch in a two.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.258
And if there's an
emergency at all,

13:03.282 --> 13:04.384
you punch in a three.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.877
So one, you left, two, you
got there, three, emergency.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.680
- Okay.
- And...

13:08.704 --> 13:11.131
Hey, I got you this.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.642
Pepper spray.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.218
- Pepper spray?
- Yeah.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.605
Anybody tries to grab
you or anything, psst!

13:16.629 --> 13:17.898
Right in the eyes.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.431
Okay, you just press
this button here.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.443
Whoa, whoa.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.101
What is that?

13:23.844 --> 13:25.813
It's a built-in alarm.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.157
Handy.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.575
And you have to promise me

13:28.599 --> 13:30.609
that you're not gonna walk
to your car alone anymore.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.746
Okay? You make sure somebody
from the band goes with you.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.832
If you're gonna drive yourself
to a gig, then call ahead

13:35.856 --> 13:37.950
and make sure somebody's waiting
for you in the parking lot.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.785
Okay?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.286
Hey...

13:41.570 --> 13:42.913
It's okay.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.082
There's nothing to be afraid of.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.084
Yeah, I know that.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.713
And, like, all of our handprints
are in the cement out front,

13:51.789 --> 13:53.465
except for Owen's, but I mean,

13:53.541 --> 13:55.551
Charlie said that he was
going to do his too, but...

13:55.668 --> 13:57.270
You know, it's kind
of this tradition...

13:57.294 --> 13:59.179
I'll bet he's a great kisser.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.014
Excuse me?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.183
Jim Trowell.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.435
I mean, look at those lips.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.022
Are you even listening to me?

14:09.598 --> 14:10.784
Yeah.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.785
Yeah, sure.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.911
Tradition.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.704
Listen, do you wanna go
to Donna Sampson's party

14:14.728 --> 14:15.830
with me tomorrow night?

14:15.854 --> 14:18.240
I mean, it sounds like
you could kind of

14:18.691 --> 14:20.784
get your mind off things
for a while, you know?

14:21.443 --> 14:22.879
I wasn't invited. Anyway...

14:22.903 --> 14:24.413
I'm inviting you, doof.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.915
I mean they play all these really
great kissing games and stuff.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.218
Kissing games?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.386
And you have to go.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.054
Cause Jim's bringing
his friend Derrick.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.130
He wants to meet you.
He's way cute.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.808
I don't know, Jody.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.467
Hey, be there, or be square.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.690
Again.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.577
Do you really wanna do this?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.328
Man, everybody's got an opinion.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.372
Come on, isn't there
somebody I can call for you?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.990
Just run this out, okay?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.549
Hi.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.176
I'm glad you're here.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.345
You can help me do the
sets for tomorrow night.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.597
Are you up for doing
<i>Heartbreak</i> in public?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.183
I guess not.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.145
What's up?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.778
I have... I have
to quit the band.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.530
Because you're scared?

15:41.273 --> 15:44.326
Look, I-I see that
guy everywhere.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.963
And this gig tomorrow night,

15:46.987 --> 15:48.757
Bailey says it's in a
really bad neighborhood.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.383
I don't want to leave
you guys in the lurch,

15:50.407 --> 15:51.927
but I don't know
what else to do.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.638
He's got me carrying pepper
spray to the bathroom...

15:54.662 --> 15:56.129
Okay, all right.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.557
First of all, I can't believe

15:57.581 --> 16:00.685
you're gonna let some
pimply-faced loser with a knife

16:00.709 --> 16:02.427
keep you from doing
something you love.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.639
Yes, we can definitely all
be a little more careful,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.100
but we can't control what
we can't control, right?

16:10.135 --> 16:12.437
I get the feeling you're
letting somebody scare you.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.772
Don't do that.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.693
'Cause I'm here, okay?

16:19.186 --> 16:20.946
And I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.699
I promise.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.503
Hey.

16:36.954 --> 16:37.973
Wow. It's late.

16:37.997 --> 16:38.890
Yeah, I know.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.467
I just wanted to catch you
when you got back from work.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.929
How was it?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.057
Work.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.195
It was work.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.520
How was your class?

16:54.304 --> 16:55.865
Open it up. See for yourself.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.442
We took some candids
on Market Street.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.958
Focus is a little soft, but
it's a pretty good shot,

17:04.982 --> 17:06.366
don't you think?

17:08.986 --> 17:10.704
Why would you lie to me?

17:12.573 --> 17:13.590
I didn't lie.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.843
Justin, I have pictures.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.752
I did not lie, okay?

17:21.415 --> 17:24.843
I didn't tell you about it,
which is not the same thing.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.562
Her name is Corey.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.116
She's an intern at the station.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.200
We met one night

17:39.224 --> 17:41.786
because we both like to take
walks during our breaks.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.329
So we started walking together

17:43.353 --> 17:46.740
and talking, and
that's what we do.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.419
What do you talk about?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.004
Do you tell her stuff about us?

17:51.028 --> 17:52.829
Yeah, I've told
her a few things.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.674
Justin, why would you...?

17:54.698 --> 17:57.250
Hey, I need to talk
to someone, okay?

17:57.659 --> 17:59.878
And I can't talk to you.
You won't let me.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.218
She's just a friend, okay?

18:07.503 --> 18:09.638
And I sort of need
that right now.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.271
Bailey!

18:18.388 --> 18:19.449
Bailey!

18:19.473 --> 18:21.733
Bailey, wake up. Wake up!
You gotta take this.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.703
What? What time is it?

18:23.727 --> 18:25.288
I don't know. You
gotta take this call.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.956
What is it, Sarah? Did
something happen?

18:26.980 --> 18:28.792
I don't know. They said they
have to speak to the oldest.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.627
Hello. Yeah, he's my brother.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.462
What happened? What is...
Something happened?

18:32.486 --> 18:33.630
What's going on?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.330
The sheriff's department.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.093
I think something
happened to Charlie.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.376
Wait. He was what?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.545
Drunk and disorderly?

18:42.162 --> 18:43.338
Yeah.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.215
Yeah, I can come
down and do that.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.758
Okay.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.056
Or maybe we should just let
him spend the night in jail.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.203
- You called Joe?
- Yeah.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.822
We didn't happen to have 2500 bucks
lying around to bail you out.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.835
Take him home, will you, Joe?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.535
I don't even want to
look at him right now.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.131
You wanna tell me what the
hell's going on with you?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.174
- Not now, Joe.
- Yeah, now, Charlie.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.718
Look, this whole thing
is not my fault, okay?

19:20.742 --> 19:22.095
Only nobody seems to
be listening to me...

19:22.119 --> 19:23.221
- First of all...
- Nobody seems...

19:23.245 --> 19:25.140
I don't give a damn about that.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.142
The fact is, it happened,
and you gotta deal with it.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.383
I mean, look at you!

19:28.625 --> 19:30.311
Is this how you
deal with things?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.771
You go out to a bar,
and you get drunk,

19:31.795 --> 19:32.981
and you punch people?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.524
What are you, 16?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.067
I'm sorry you got dragged
into this, okay?

19:36.091 --> 19:37.068
Can we please just go?

19:37.092 --> 19:38.945
Charlie, I don't get you.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.188
You got a lot going for you.
You know that?

19:41.471 --> 19:42.532
You're raising the kids.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.867
They're doing great.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.785
You did a beautiful job
with the restaurant.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.079
You had Kirsten, this
incredible woman.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.489
And yet, what do
you do every time?

19:50.731 --> 19:55.076
Anything good comes along, you
find a way to screw it up!

19:55.777 --> 19:57.245
Thanks for bailing me out.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.081
I'll pay you back.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.599
Hey.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.102
What are you doing here?

20:22.971 --> 20:25.899
I was just wondering
if you wake up happy.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.528
'Cause I do.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.404
Like every morning, I...

20:32.648 --> 20:34.324
I keep having these dreams.

20:35.567 --> 20:40.298
Like this morning,
we were 6-years-old,

20:40.322 --> 20:43.333
and we were playing
tag in the woods.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.213
And it felt good.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.767
And when I wake up,

20:50.791 --> 20:54.177
it's like that feeling's still
with me while I'm lying there.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.180
And then...

20:58.632 --> 21:02.644
I remember, and it's like I
wake up again, you know?

21:04.554 --> 21:06.940
I wish I could
remember those dreams.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.279
All we do now is
fight, you know?

21:12.854 --> 21:15.240
And accuse each other.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.201
I mean, we can't even
talk anymore, you know?

21:21.405 --> 21:22.872
Do you still love me?

21:24.366 --> 21:26.094
I mean, 'cause if you don't,

21:26.118 --> 21:27.919
I kind of need to
know, you know?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.337
Of course I do.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.595
Oh, God.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.930
Can't we just...?

21:40.590 --> 21:42.225
I don't know. Can't we...?

21:43.176 --> 21:44.352
Yeah.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.899
Wow, so, Charlie, huh?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.203
I mean, was he hurt?
Did he hurt anybody?

21:52.227 --> 21:53.746
No. No, not really.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.290
Just... He's kind of out
of control right now,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.907
but my point is, when
Claudia woke me up,

21:58.567 --> 21:59.544
the first thing I thought

21:59.568 --> 22:01.129
was that something bad
had happened to you,

22:01.153 --> 22:05.081
and... So I'm thinking that I
should come with you tonight.

22:05.532 --> 22:06.833
I'm just gonna come with you.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.462
God, Bailey, you know what?
Just... God.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.173
- What?
- Would you please stop?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.642
What, am I supposed
to feel guilty now

22:14.666 --> 22:16.176
every time your phone rings?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.345
No, Sarah. I just...

22:18.712 --> 22:20.690
I'm just... I'm worried
about you, that's all.

22:20.714 --> 22:21.816
You could've been killed.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.860
Yes, yeah, Bailey,
I could have been,

22:23.884 --> 22:24.777
but that is the last thing

22:24.801 --> 22:26.770
that I need you to remind
me of all the time.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.272
Look, I need to get past this,
but you're not letting me.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.117
Okay, so I've got
the pager number,

22:31.141 --> 22:32.035
I've got the pepper spray,

22:32.059 --> 22:34.579
Matt's gonna be with me at the
gig tonight, so I'm fine.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.154
Will you please just lay off?

22:36.396 --> 22:37.572
God.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.786
Then how about jewelry?

22:45.238 --> 22:47.091
Oh, look, perfect.

22:47.115 --> 22:50.928
You know, yin and yang
represents harmony of opposites,

22:50.952 --> 22:54.089
man, woman, dark, light...

22:54.164 --> 22:56.966
If you gave this to me,
I'd melt, honest to God.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.551
Uh...

22:58.668 --> 23:00.396
I don't know. I think
she'd probably...

23:00.420 --> 23:01.314
Hate it.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.774
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.350
Wow. No wonder you're going
to all this trouble.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.320
She sounds delightful.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.561
Corey!

23:10.347 --> 23:11.949
No, she is. She is, really.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.316
She's, uh...

23:14.059 --> 23:16.361
She's just kind of hard
to read sometimes.

23:18.313 --> 23:20.666
I don't know. I gave her jewelry
for Valentine's Day, so...

23:20.690 --> 23:22.325
Oh, okay, well...

23:23.151 --> 23:24.337
You want my advice,

23:24.361 --> 23:26.704
get her some perfume
and call it a day.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.706
What kind does she wear?

23:29.157 --> 23:31.292
Uh, I think it's that.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.670
I don't know. I'd
have to smell it.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.760
Mm...

23:41.628 --> 23:44.097
I don't know. It's,
uh, different on you.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.433
A little sweeter, maybe.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.105
I think she'd hate it.

23:53.849 --> 23:54.951
So her parents just, like,

23:54.975 --> 23:56.452
let her have parties
all the time?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.486
Only on nights when
they both have to work.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.540
Okay, now, if either
of us wants to leave,

24:00.564 --> 24:02.490
we just, like, pull on
our earlobe, right?

24:03.191 --> 24:05.618
Oh, there's Jim. Be cool, okay?

24:07.779 --> 24:08.955
Hey.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.248
Hey.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.877
You guys know Derrick?

24:13.952 --> 24:14.971
Hey.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.212
Hey.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.381
Hey.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.303
You want to play, uh...

24:23.628 --> 24:25.054
Seven Minutes in Heaven?

24:25.088 --> 24:26.274
Cool.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.515
Cool.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.184
Cool.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.519
Is that like charades?

24:33.346 --> 24:35.315
Ah, come on.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.484
I'll show you.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.366
Hey.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.659
Hey.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.131
Let's hold off on the second set

24:50.155 --> 24:51.924
till the guys from
K-BAD show up.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.259
That's our best stuff.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.760
Oh, can we throw in <i>Fever</i> too?

24:54.784 --> 24:56.586
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.173
What is this, pepper spray?

25:01.124 --> 25:03.186
Yeah. Bailey's idea.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.937
Pretty soon I'll be wearing
a bulletproof vest

25:04.961 --> 25:06.439
and carrying a
semiautomatic weapon.

25:06.463 --> 25:07.815
You know, he'd have
a tracking device

25:07.839 --> 25:09.307
installed in my
head if he could.

25:10.508 --> 25:11.976
Oh, he's driving me nuts.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.480
You're driving me nuts.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.696
I'm sorry.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.082
Um...

25:25.106 --> 25:28.618
I know you have a boyfriend, so,

25:29.152 --> 25:32.080
let's just call this a
brain burp for now, okay?

25:34.407 --> 25:36.501
Okay, let's get started.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.718
Wow, it's... it's dark in here.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.932
Uh, we don't need the light.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.311
Can't we just leave
it on for a second?

25:56.513 --> 25:57.855
Uh, sure.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.692
Okey-dokey.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.573
Wow,

26:07.107 --> 26:08.741
somebody plays tennis.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.462
Uh, yeah.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.788
Um, we only have seven minutes.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.925
I mean, they're timing
us outside, so...

26:15.949 --> 26:17.125
So,

26:17.534 --> 26:19.377
what are we supposed to do?

26:20.537 --> 26:23.506
Well, you know,
make out and stuff.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.800
What kind of stuff?

26:26.584 --> 26:28.386
Here, I'll show you.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.855
Hey!

26:29.879 --> 26:31.055
Hey!

26:31.840 --> 26:33.224
Hey, what's your problem?

26:34.801 --> 26:36.102
Man!

26:38.388 --> 26:39.772
Nice shot.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.276
Where is this?

26:43.852 --> 26:46.580
We have this window
seat in our house.

26:46.604 --> 26:48.489
And the light's really
pretty in the afternoon.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.209
And you took this?

26:50.233 --> 26:51.492
Yeah.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.839
Took me, like, forever to figure
out how to use the self-timer,

26:54.863 --> 26:56.539
but, yeah.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.251
What do you think?

27:00.535 --> 27:01.554
I think,

27:01.578 --> 27:02.879
she's in focus.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.674
And she's pretty.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.136
And she's...

27:11.755 --> 27:13.431
She's kind of haunted, hm?

27:14.549 --> 27:15.892
Which is nice, actually.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.615
I don't know.
8-by-10 is so huge.

27:21.639 --> 27:24.493
Maybe I should do,
like, a 5-by-7.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.911
It's a gift, so...

27:25.935 --> 27:27.111
Oh, really?

27:27.937 --> 27:28.998
For who?

27:29.022 --> 27:32.408
For my... For this
friend of mine.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.505
Anyway, a 5-by-7 of
me looking haunted

27:36.529 --> 27:38.206
is probably a lot better than...

27:51.127 --> 27:52.804
Well, anyway, I'll, uh,

27:54.464 --> 27:56.557
put this in the fixer, and, uh,

27:58.009 --> 27:59.435
you'll be all set.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.413
You don't need to be here.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.958
I know.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.835
I want to, okay?

28:24.285 --> 28:25.179
Go home, Charlie.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.671
Go pull yourself together.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.216
I'm sorry, but, uh,

28:30.333 --> 28:32.343
you don't need to worry
about coming back.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.067
What is this? Are you firing me?

28:38.091 --> 28:39.610
Is that what this is?
'Cause you gotta at least...

28:39.634 --> 28:41.936
No, no. I'm not
firing you, Charlie.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.983
I'm shutting the place down.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.578
What?

28:49.602 --> 28:52.206
I talked to Isley's attorney,
and they're not budging.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.742
So I don't see any point in
dragging this out until June.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.795
It'd be one long funeral,
week after week,

28:57.819 --> 28:59.046
and I don't wanna do that,

28:59.070 --> 29:02.133
so I'm giving everybody
their severance.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.427
I'm gonna let our
regular customers know,

29:04.451 --> 29:08.755
and, uh, try to let this place
die with a little dignity.

29:09.080 --> 29:14.010
Just, um, get it over with
while I'm still in town and

29:14.836 --> 29:16.012
move on.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.479
All this work you did

29:25.513 --> 29:26.731
for what?

29:29.601 --> 29:32.945
Listen, tell the kids to come in
next Friday for their dinner.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.364
That's gonna be the last night.

29:36.024 --> 29:36.959
Joe.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.242
It's finished, Charlie.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.590
Wow.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.228
You did this with a timer?

29:56.252 --> 29:57.470
Uh-huh.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.358
You made the print
and everything?

30:01.382 --> 30:03.518
Well, I had some help.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.436
It's beautiful.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.230
Thanks.

30:09.682 --> 30:10.817
You like?

30:13.102 --> 30:14.362
It's nice.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.447
Did somebody help
you pick this out?

30:16.648 --> 30:18.501
'Cause the last time you
bought me perfume...

30:18.525 --> 30:19.668
What was that called?

30:19.692 --> 30:21.577
Uh... God, uh...

30:21.820 --> 30:22.713
Barracuda.

30:22.737 --> 30:23.714
Yeah.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.289
I was 12, so...

30:28.284 --> 30:32.004
Yeah, the, uh, saleslady
helped me this time.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.424
Well, it's-it's great.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.679
So anyways...

30:41.923 --> 30:43.182
Yeah.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.832
So I was wondering,

30:57.856 --> 30:59.615
is there some reason
why we aren't talking?

31:00.608 --> 31:01.951
I don't know.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.337
We're talking now.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.579
You tell me.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.375
So you haven't talked to
Will since last night?

31:10.076 --> 31:11.294
Will? No.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.421
- Why?
- No reason.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.010
Matt kissed me.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.139
Matt kissed you?

31:23.172 --> 31:24.358
You mean, you mean, like...

31:24.382 --> 31:25.600
Yeah.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.311
Yeah. It was a
surprise to me too.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.149
Did you

31:33.266 --> 31:34.609
kiss him back?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.616
Well, d-did you want
to kiss him back?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.995
Is-is-is something going on?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.289
Sarah, because...

31:48.323 --> 31:50.342
I mean, obviously he's
interested in you,

31:50.366 --> 31:52.511
and I should probably break his
neck the next time I see him...

31:52.535 --> 31:55.681
Bailey, it just happened, okay?

31:55.705 --> 31:57.182
It happened, and it
didn't mean anything.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.601
And I just thought the
decent thing to do

31:58.625 --> 32:01.177
was to tell you because
you should know.

32:03.546 --> 32:04.889
So now I know.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.438
Hey!

32:12.889 --> 32:14.565
What happened to you last night?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.943
You missed a wild
game of Spotlight.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.278
Derrick didn't tell you?

32:19.520 --> 32:20.414
Yeah.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.624
He told me you're
a great kisser,

32:21.648 --> 32:22.949
and you guys got to second base.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.325
Way to go.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.410
He said that?

32:26.444 --> 32:27.880
You bet. Oh, guess what.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.757
Jim wants us to meet up for
the movies this afternoon.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.883
His brother works at the Metro

32:30.907 --> 32:32.500
and can sneak us
into something good.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.126
It's gonna be a blast.

32:35.578 --> 32:37.338
Is that all you care about?

32:37.956 --> 32:38.849
Excuse me?

32:38.873 --> 32:40.132
'Cause I don't.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.561
I don't wanna go to the
movies with those guys.

32:42.585 --> 32:43.687
I just...

32:43.711 --> 32:47.390
I'm-I'm not ready for all the
stuff with Jim and Derrick and...

32:50.218 --> 32:52.019
Can't things just be
the way they were?

32:52.887 --> 32:54.105
Why?

32:56.224 --> 32:57.483
You know, I just...

32:58.518 --> 32:59.860
Just forget about it.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.498
You know, if you wanna
spend all your time

33:02.522 --> 33:03.948
with them instead
of me, that's...

33:05.024 --> 33:06.158
That's fine. Just

33:06.275 --> 33:07.451
do what you want.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.465
Hey, I'm not trying
to cut you out, okay?

33:11.489 --> 33:13.258
But, you see, this
thing with Jim,

33:13.282 --> 33:14.635
this is, like, really
cool, you know.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.502
This is something
that I want to do.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.755
So I mean, you can
come along or not.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.549
It's kind of your call.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.142
- Julia...
- Uh, oops.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.643
Disappointed?

33:33.052 --> 33:34.279
No, no. Not at all.

33:34.303 --> 33:35.280
I hate to be a copycat,

33:35.304 --> 33:37.157
but I was wearing it
all day yesterday,

33:37.181 --> 33:38.482
and it just sort of grew on me.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.692
So...

33:40.143 --> 33:42.371
how'd it go, uh, with Julia?

33:42.395 --> 33:43.696
Uh...

33:44.272 --> 33:45.499
it was, uh...

33:45.523 --> 33:46.741
weird.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.994
How weird?

33:51.404 --> 33:52.381
"Weird" weird.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.539
Uh...

33:53.865 --> 33:54.999
I just...

33:56.242 --> 33:57.752
Ah, forget about it.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.475
Look, I know things are kind of
hard for you right now, okay.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.759
I get that.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.063
But, I don't know, you know,

34:09.088 --> 34:11.942
maybe it would make things
easier for you to know

34:11.966 --> 34:13.485
that there is someone
else in this world

34:13.509 --> 34:16.687
who thinks you're adorable,
and you're smart,

34:16.846 --> 34:18.699
and your jokes are
actually funny, and you...

34:18.723 --> 34:20.315
Wait... Wait a minute.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.195
Don't say anything
else, all right?

34:24.771 --> 34:26.237
Why not?

34:28.649 --> 34:30.826
Hearing you say it out loud, uh,

34:32.402 --> 34:34.705
sort of makes it official.

34:35.281 --> 34:38.260
And, I don't know, I just
don't wanna screw up

34:38.284 --> 34:40.043
whatever we have going here.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.922
Oh.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.382
Okay.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.882
I think.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.552
You're right, though.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.888
It is nice to know.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.266
You should probably take
some pictures, huh?

34:57.678 --> 35:00.856
Let's just sit here for a
few more minutes, okay?

35:03.142 --> 35:04.402
Yeah.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.321
So, um...

35:09.065 --> 35:11.325
You remember last night
in the darkroom when I,

35:12.318 --> 35:14.036
sort of kissed you?

35:14.862 --> 35:16.038
Mm-hm.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.541
Well, you haven't said
anything about it,

35:18.908 --> 35:23.087
so I'm just wondering
what that means.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.841
I, um...

35:27.834 --> 35:29.802
have a-a boyfriend.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.431
Why didn't you tell me?

35:35.758 --> 35:39.687
Because things haven't been
that great with him lately,

35:40.346 --> 35:41.647
and

35:42.557 --> 35:45.744
we've just been going
through all this stuff,

35:45.768 --> 35:48.696
and it's just been
really hard right now,

35:49.730 --> 35:50.990
and

35:53.192 --> 35:54.577
it's just

35:54.861 --> 35:56.996
easier with you.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.808
Remember this?

36:20.720 --> 36:23.147
That ugly checkered
material on all the booths?

36:25.766 --> 36:28.360
And him, the dishwasher?

36:29.896 --> 36:31.155
What was his name?

36:32.398 --> 36:33.741
Ernest, I think.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.076
Yeah.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.213
He used to give me dimes

36:38.237 --> 36:40.080
and tell me they
were silver dollars.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.508
Claudia.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.000
I was just thinking about

36:43.409 --> 36:45.002
how I wouldn't go there,

36:46.662 --> 36:48.797
you know, right after
Mom and Dad died.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.718
Only you finally
made me because...

36:53.544 --> 36:55.763
you said it was like
he's still there.

36:58.758 --> 36:59.934
Yeah, I know.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.435
And you were right.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.438
I mean, even now,

37:05.598 --> 37:07.358
I know it doesn't look the same,

37:08.517 --> 37:10.611
but it-it still feels
like his place.

37:11.687 --> 37:14.406
And when I go there after
school or to a family dinner,

37:15.900 --> 37:17.785
that's when I feel close to him.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.372
That's when I...

37:21.572 --> 37:23.832
I feel like part of
him is still here.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.715
This is really
gonna happen, huh?

37:34.210 --> 37:35.344
I'm sorry.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.973
For whatever that's worth.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.478
You think that, um,

37:46.973 --> 37:48.732
you'll ever be able to
forgive me for this?

37:53.854 --> 37:55.155
I love you, Charlie.

37:59.652 --> 38:00.995
But, no.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.000
I don't think I can.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.763
Hey.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.015
Hey.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.683
My favorite shirt.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.768
Oh, yeah.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.198
I was just gonna go catch a
movie with Will and Gina.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.492
Aren't you guys playing
at that dance tonight?

38:30.516 --> 38:31.576
Yeah. I'm on my way.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.236
You know, can we
talk for a second?

38:38.190 --> 38:41.753
Look, I keep thinking about all
this stuff, all the weirdness,

38:41.777 --> 38:43.329
and the thing with Matt,

38:44.905 --> 38:47.333
well, it's-it's not
about me and Matt.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.919
It's about us,
Bailey, you and me.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.142
It's like you're smothering me

38:55.166 --> 38:57.718
because you want me to be
dependent on you or something.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.563
And maybe there's nothing
wrong with that.

38:59.587 --> 39:00.763
I don't know.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.140
But you're not always
gonna be here.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.027
You know, you're out of
here in a few months,

39:05.051 --> 39:06.477
and I'm gonna be on my own,

39:06.719 --> 39:09.229
so I sort of need to learn
how to depend on myself.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.203
And you have to let
me do that, Bailey.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.528
You have to.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.657
I have to,

39:21.734 --> 39:22.669
because you say so,

39:22.693 --> 39:24.629
and so that's the
way it's gonna be.

39:24.653 --> 39:25.547
Bailey, listen to me...

39:25.571 --> 39:26.830
I heard what you said.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.749
I'm smothering you,

39:28.783 --> 39:32.054
and, and I worry too
much about you,

39:32.078 --> 39:33.305
and I'm making you crazy,

39:33.329 --> 39:34.389
and so...

39:34.413 --> 39:36.548
So now I'm just supposed
to stop doing that.

39:37.625 --> 39:38.842
Is that it?

39:40.920 --> 39:42.054
'Cause...

39:42.671 --> 39:45.817
I don't think I can
do that, Sarah.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.726
I don't think that I can just...

39:49.845 --> 39:52.366
S-see, you obviously have
this all figured out,

39:52.390 --> 39:55.567
but have you stopped to think
that maybe there's a reason

39:55.643 --> 39:58.737
why I act the way I act
and why I worry so much?

40:00.815 --> 40:01.990
It's...

40:04.026 --> 40:05.244
I've lost people, Sarah.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.882
And there's nothing that I can
do about that now, I know that,

40:08.906 --> 40:12.126
but the thought of going
through all that again,

40:12.410 --> 40:13.877
It's-it's so...

40:16.539 --> 40:18.132
I-I just can't.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.480
Sarah, if you can't
let me love you

40:23.504 --> 40:25.222
the way that I need
to love you, then...

40:28.592 --> 40:30.519
Then I don't know how
to make this work.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.619
Charlie.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.125
Is everything okay?

40:54.702 --> 40:55.878
I'm sorry.

40:57.496 --> 40:59.141
I didn't even know if I was
actually gonna do this.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.717
I just... I didn't
think you'd be here.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.053
I was just gonna drive by and
see if the light was on.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.431
It's crazy.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.725
I'm crazy. It's...

41:10.134 --> 41:12.436
Uh... Do you want to come in?

41:14.138 --> 41:15.439
Yeah.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.281
I'm sorry.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.449
I'm just...

41:27.067 --> 41:28.410
I screwed up.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.287
I screwed everything up.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.623
I'm a mess.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.418
Nothing's going right, and
I've lost things that...

41:36.535 --> 41:38.212
That matter so much.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.547
Important things.

41:41.415 --> 41:43.268
And-and I'm just trying
to remember a time

41:43.292 --> 41:46.229
when everything wasn't
falling apart, you know,

41:46.253 --> 41:47.763
when everything was okay.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.224
And that was...

41:51.884 --> 41:53.519
The only time was
when we were...

41:54.929 --> 41:56.730
When... When I was with you.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.621
There are some things that
I know that I can't fix,

42:02.645 --> 42:05.197
but maybe... Maybe this.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.285
I love you, Kirsten,

42:10.986 --> 42:11.963
and I want you back.

42:11.987 --> 42:12.881
Charlie...

42:12.905 --> 42:16.041
No, look, I know that there are
things we need to talk about,

42:16.116 --> 42:18.803
and I know that I'm just
springing this on you,

42:18.827 --> 42:22.965
and it's sudden, but I-I think
that we could make this work.

42:23.457 --> 42:24.633
I really do.

42:27.628 --> 42:28.887
You're too late.

42:33.884 --> 42:35.102
I'm...

42:39.056 --> 42:40.440
His name is Michael.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.486
He's an associate professor
in the department,

42:45.896 --> 42:47.155
and we've been

42:48.023 --> 42:49.533
seeing each other for a while.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.624
We're getting married, Charlie.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.503
We're getting married next week.
