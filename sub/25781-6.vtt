01:09.861 --> 01:11.905
Huh?

01:13.114 --> 01:15.366
Maybe if we run this configuration.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.452
Still nothing.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.872
- Allura, try the sonic wave.
- Okay, I'll try.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.543
It's still not working.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.297
And it probably won't work again
until our power-cores are recharged.

01:29.380 --> 01:34.260
Roger that. Well, our long-range scanners
still haven't detected any planets nearby.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.513
No star systems, nothing.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.722
Ugh.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.309
-How long have we been out here?
-Going on four movements.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.895
And how long is it gonna take us
to get to Earth at this speed?

01:43.978 --> 01:47.524
I think Pidge said something
like ten billion deca-phoebes.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.902
- I said one and a half Earth years.
- Eh.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.655
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, there's a big discrepancy

01:53.738 --> 01:56.157
between ten billion deca-phoebes
and one and a half Earth years.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.368
-Which one is it?
-It's one and a half Earth years!

01:58.785 --> 02:00.495
We've gone over this several times,

02:00.578 --> 02:02.539
though there may
be a margin of error of about a month,

02:02.622 --> 02:05.125
depending on any time dilation
we encounter.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.794
Look, we knew this wasn't going
to be an easy or quick voyage,

02:08.877 --> 02:11.381
but replacing the Castle of Lions
is our top priority.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.175
We just have to stay sharp
and maintain discipline.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.178
We knew when we started this journey
that we'd be low on power.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.515
We didn't plan on going through the
galactic void, but we'll get through it.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.767
Don't worry, guys. We'll run into
something eventually

02:22.851 --> 02:24.227
that will turn this trip around.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.687
What makes you so sure?

02:25.770 --> 02:27.981
If my experience in space
has taught me anything...

02:28.231 --> 02:31.484
it's that something always
comes along to try to kill us.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.824
Hey, Pidge, why is it so dark
out here?

02:37.907 --> 02:40.994
I can't be sure, but my theory
is that this area is surrounded

02:41.077 --> 02:44.038
by some kind of nebula
that blocks most of the light.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.042
Oh, yeah. Must be a patch
of that dark matter I've heard about.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.378
That isn't what dark matter is.

02:50.461 --> 02:55.800
Although, when it's this dark,
I guess it doesn't matter, right, guys?

02:57.093 --> 02:59.178
This is why no one rides
with me anymore, isn't it?

03:00.096 --> 03:03.808
Guys, I think I might have an idea on how
to get the lions back to full power.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.269
And you're just now telling us this?

03:06.352 --> 03:07.770
Well, I'm sorry, Lance,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.731
but I guess
having my consciousness transplanted

03:09.814 --> 03:11.816
from the infinity
of Voltron's inner quintessence

03:11.900 --> 03:14.027
into the dead body of an evil clone
of myself

03:14.110 --> 03:16.738
has left me a little out of sorts
for the past few weeks.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.697
Oh.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.656
Yeah.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.742
What is it, Shiro?

03:21.159 --> 03:24.954
It's difficult to articulate, but remember
when we were fighting Zarkon...

03:25.038 --> 03:27.707
and we were hit with that beam
that drained all of our quintessence?

03:29.542 --> 03:32.462
Yes, you were all
completely incapacitated.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.588
That's right,

03:33.671 --> 03:36.966
but we managed to regenerate
enough power to keep fighting.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.470
Yeah. We repowered Voltron ourselves.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.224
Exactly. And I think
that's how it's meant to work.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.893
Since I disappeared,

03:46.976 --> 03:50.396
you've been relying on the Castle's
crystal to keep the lions charged.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.734
But if you were a team of fully-realized
paladins, you wouldn't need that.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.488
I... I can't help but feel
this must be my fault.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.492
You were able to recharge Voltron before,
but since I joined...

04:02.575 --> 04:03.868
It's no one's fault.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.121
Being a Paladin of Voltron takes training.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.374
You just haven't had time
to focus on working together

04:09.457 --> 04:11.834
to find your balance
in this configuration.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.212
Well, we've got nothing but time now.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.714
That's right. We've been down before,
and we always come back.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.094
I'm glad you're here, Shiro.
After all you went through,

04:21.177 --> 04:23.388
how did you find
the strength to be the leader of Voltron?

04:23.471 --> 04:24.639
I had help.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.142
That's why there are five of you,
to lift each other up.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.063
So, what should we do?
Maybe some flight formation exercises?

04:32.146 --> 04:33.273
What's that?

04:33.481 --> 04:37.485
-You know, when you line up and...
-No, no, no! That! Dead ahead!

04:40.947 --> 04:42.991
My scanners aren't picking
anything up!

04:47.537 --> 04:50.081
What the quiznak is this?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.959
Whatever it is,
we got to move!

05:02.510 --> 05:03.344
Break high!

05:10.351 --> 05:11.269
Ah!

05:23.197 --> 05:24.824
Is everyone all right?

05:26.951 --> 05:27.827
I'm here.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.413
Still alive.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.582
That was crazy.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.209
I'm fine.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.923
Hey, are you okay, buddy?

05:41.424 --> 05:43.009
Shiro, can you hear me?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.890
Shiro seems to be frozen,
but his vitals are strong.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.099
Same here.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.102
Copy that with Romelle. What's going on?

05:53.269 --> 05:57.523
Coran is frozen as well. Our paladin armor
must have protected us from the shock.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.985
The Blue Lion is completely incapacitated.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.612
Yeah, Red is out too.

06:02.695 --> 06:07.658
So, we're all alone in space,
no power, no way to call for help,

06:07.742 --> 06:10.078
nothing within several
thousand light years...

06:10.161 --> 06:11.370
What do we do?

06:13.831 --> 06:16.834
Pidge, is there any way
to get the lions back up and running?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.545
Maybe, but I don't know
how long it'll take.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.713
And I don't know if you've noticed,

06:20.797 --> 06:23.800
but we're all drifting
in opposite directions after that blast.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.928
If we don't get the power back on,
we might lose each other.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.306
Okay, the power's gonna have to wait.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.142
Our top priority
is tethering the lions together.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.062
I think I have an idea
of how we can do it.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.689
How? Some magical powers
that you learned on Oriande?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.526
No, I have some
leftover zip line in my hull.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.735
Oh.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.779
We're getting out of our lions to do this?

06:44.862 --> 06:47.448
We don't even know
what that energy pulse was.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.285
It's the only way to stay together.
Allura, grab that zip line.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.578
Let's get moving.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.090
Everyone stay sharp and hang on.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.592
Ugh.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.011
So many lions, all spinning.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.974
Come on, Hunk.
You've been through worse than this.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.644
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Let me just...
Nope.

07:17.061 --> 07:21.232
No good. Oh, don't barf
in the space helmet, Hunk. Don't do it.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.193
You're going to need
to push your lions to my location.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.113
Otherwise, there won't be enough cord
to attach us together.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.700
Uh, by ourselves?
I don't think that's possible.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.538
Yeah, no,
we're definitely gonna need more help.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.750
Our jetpacks just don't
have enough thrust.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.463
This is gonna take forever.
We're gonna have to do this one by one.

07:44.046 --> 07:47.049
On our way. Everyone to the Yellow Lion!

07:50.011 --> 07:51.929
-Oh, no!
-What?

07:53.931 --> 07:55.475
Everyone hold on!

07:59.979 --> 08:02.732
I'm losing my...

08:17.497 --> 08:19.207
I'm losing sight of the lions!

08:19.332 --> 08:21.709
- Stay together!
- Oh, no!

08:25.004 --> 08:26.047
I got Hunk!

08:27.381 --> 08:28.466
I've got Pidge!

08:30.051 --> 08:32.220
Fire your jetpacks. Let's get stabilized.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.015
Oh, thank you.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.438
-Does anyone have eyes on the lions?
-I can't see them.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.982
Neither can I.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.319
At this point, I don't even know
which direction they're in.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.323
Okay, let's run through our checklist.
Does anyone have any supplies?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.742
- Nope.
- Mm-mm. Nothing.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.619
No food. No water.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.873
Our suits will recycle enough moisture
to keep us hydrated for a little while.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.126
We just need to hang tight.
We have each other.

09:05.503 --> 09:09.340
Don't worry, Hunk. Something else
will be along to kill us any minute now.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.134
Any minute.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.973
Any minute.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.938
Everyone sound off.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.775
-Lance here.
-Pidge here.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.652
Allura here.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.406
-Hunk?
-I'm hiding.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.450
I need you to sound off, Hunk.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.204
It's important to maintain discipline
and mental acuity in these situations.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.124
These techniques helped my mom
and I through the Quantum Abyss.

09:43.207 --> 09:47.712
Keith is right. Being lost in space
has been known to drive one mad.

09:48.170 --> 09:52.675
Too much time contemplating infinity
is not good for the mind.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.637
I like to keep busy
calculating pi out as far as I can.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.972
The record is 4 quadrillion,

09:58.055 --> 10:00.683
but that's using the Hadoop
parallelization framework.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.351
I'm just using my brain.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.146
Hadoop.

10:05.646 --> 10:10.401
-Wait. Guys! Look! Lights!
-Told you Lance would go crazy first.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.237
No, no, no, no! I see them!
There really are lights!

10:16.824 --> 10:20.494
-Perhaps it's a ship.
-Oh, yes! Yes! We're rescued!

10:30.588 --> 10:32.048
Amazing.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.800
They're beautiful.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.350
We should follow them.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.060
-What?
-Yeah.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.812
They must be heading somewhere.
Like a hive or something.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.189
Wherever that is, it must be better

10:48.272 --> 10:50.816
than floating around here
just, like, starving to death.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.862
Hunk's right. Let's follow them.
Everyone stay together.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.992
Where'd they go?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.119
Were they even real?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.039
I guess they could've been
a hallucination.

11:05.623 --> 11:10.586
But that usually only happens
when you're going mad.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.262
Everyone...

11:22.181 --> 11:23.891
Everyone sound off.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.394
Allura here.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.604
Lance here.

11:29.897 --> 11:30.940
Pidge here.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.778
Hunk, sound off immediately!

11:35.861 --> 11:39.824
-Keith, you don't have to--
-It's okay, Allura. It's okay.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.537
I was just kind of, you know,
lost in this fantasy

11:44.620 --> 11:46.455
that we'd get to Earth and,

11:46.539 --> 11:49.500
you know, the Garrison would throw us
a parade and all that stuff,

11:49.583 --> 11:52.837
and then, you know, maybe I'd meet
some hotshot pilot

11:52.920 --> 11:54.380
who wanted to check out the Yellow Lion,

11:54.463 --> 11:57.383
and then maybe the Yellow Lion
would take a shine to her, obviously,

11:57.466 --> 11:59.051
and I'd be like, "Whoa.

11:59.135 --> 12:02.972
Whoa. I can't stand in-between
you two. The bond is strong here."

12:03.514 --> 12:06.559
Hunk, what are you talking about?

12:08.602 --> 12:10.855
Fantasizing about quitting Voltron.

12:11.522 --> 12:17.027
No, no, no, no, not quitting. No.
Just, you know, being the bigger man.

12:17.111 --> 12:21.449
Just stepping aside to pass the baton down
to a younger generation.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.370
Am I quite wrong or is Hunk
still very young by Earth standards?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.039
No, I think time is different
for me,

12:29.123 --> 12:31.292
like I'm on dog years or something.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.797
What's happening?

12:38.132 --> 12:39.216
What is this?

12:40.384 --> 12:41.594
I'm being pulled away!

12:44.597 --> 12:47.850
Something is attacking us!
Keith, what do we do?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.435
I can't hold on!

13:07.244 --> 13:09.955
My bayard won't work.
We don't know where the lions are.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.708
We're being attacked
by things we can't even see.

13:12.958 --> 13:17.087
Keith, what are you talking about?
There's nothing out there. It's just us.

13:30.893 --> 13:35.064
-Keith, shouldn't we sound off?
-What's the point?

13:36.315 --> 13:39.360
-Lance here.
-Pidge here.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.863
-Allura here.
-I am Hunk.

13:45.324 --> 13:51.121
-I wonder how my dad and Matt are doing.
-Better than us, hopefully.

13:51.205 --> 13:55.376
My father had something
he always said in dire situations.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.045
-"Give up"?
-Sorry?

13:58.128 --> 14:01.966
It just doesn't seem like he was
a real fighter when the chips were down.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.884
Keith, come on.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.639
You have a lot of nerve
questioning someone's leadership

14:08.722 --> 14:12.309
-seeing how you left us!
-Allura, please.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.855
As I recall, you were the one who got us
all cozied up to Lotor.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.693
Keith, you ran away.
Maybe you should have just stayed away.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.654
Lance, Keith, everyone, stop!

14:23.737 --> 14:26.198
Look, guys, I understand
what's happening here.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.368
You're all brave heroes who don't know
how to react to being scared,

14:29.451 --> 14:31.370
and it's causing you
to attack one another.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.457
That or you're all going space mad.
Hopefully, you're just scared.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.127
I'm scared all the time.
I can talk you through it.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.131
Sorry, Hunk, I guess I just don't know
how to be a coward.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.969
-Right. That's what I'm saying.
-Why don't you leave him alone, Keith?

14:47.052 --> 14:49.972
Just drift off by yourself, Mr. Lone Wolf.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.891
-Fine.
-No, don't!

14:52.433 --> 14:54.685
We have to stay together!

14:55.311 --> 14:58.480
Why, Hunk? Are we really even friends?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.149
Is there anything holding us together

15:00.232 --> 15:03.277
besides some messed up series
of coincidences?

15:03.694 --> 15:09.617
I mean, what are we? Some chosen saviors?
Do you really believe that?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
What are we even doing out here?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.539
We're doing what we have to.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.542
-Let me go!
-No!

15:19.376 --> 15:20.419
Uh, guys?

15:21.837 --> 15:23.589
Is it more of those creatures?

15:24.840 --> 15:30.596
No, it appears to be a single source.
It looks like a planet.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.889
No way.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.601
It's... Earth.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.941
That wave must have knocked us
all the way across the universe!

15:42.024 --> 15:43.067
We're home!

15:47.237 --> 15:48.822
We're gonna make it, guys!

15:59.875 --> 16:02.044
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
guys, where's the sun?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.714
Where's the other planets? Or the moon?

16:06.715 --> 16:11.220
Stop! This is too good to be true.
Stop. Everybody, stop!

16:12.137 --> 16:14.807
-Hunk, what are you doing?
-Stop it, Hunk!

16:15.224 --> 16:16.600
No, no, something is wrong!

16:17.142 --> 16:21.355
Hunk, you're hallucinating! You're going
space mad! Just let us take you home!

16:23.565 --> 16:25.901
No! Listen to yourselves!

16:25.985 --> 16:27.653
You're letting all of this
get the better of you.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.363
There's no way that can be Earth.

16:29.530 --> 16:33.200
Just trust us, Hunk.
You'll thank us when we get there.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.661
Let me go!

17:05.315 --> 17:08.736
-What the quiznak is that thing?
-Hunk was right.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.113
-He saved us.
-Here it comes!

17:21.582 --> 17:23.709
Guys, that thing is hunting us.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.170
It's gonna get us all
unless we do something.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.256
Like what? We can't even use our bayards.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.633
How did you manifest yours, Hunk?

17:31.717 --> 17:34.678
I don't know.
I just knew that I needed to.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.639
What are we gonna do?
We don't stand a chance!

17:39.391 --> 17:41.685
Get out of here.
I'll buy you some time. Go!

17:41.769 --> 17:42.978
- Hunk!
- No!

17:51.653 --> 17:53.864
-What are you doing?
-Fire jetpacks!

18:01.914 --> 18:04.708
What are you guys doing?
I told you to escape!

18:05.000 --> 18:07.419
-Why would we ever do that without you?
-Yeah.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.713
You can't expect us to just leave you.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.967
We're a team, Hunk.
We have to stick together like you said.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.764
I'm sorry I said those hurtful things
earlier. I was wrong.

18:19.431 --> 18:23.727
This series of messed up coincidences
did happen for a reason.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.313
They brought us together as paladins.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.482
But more importantly...

18:29.233 --> 18:31.235
they brought us together as friends.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.746
All right, team. We have to attack this
thing with our bayards

18:42.830 --> 18:44.289
from every side possible.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.126
- That way it can't target us all at once.
- Yeah!

19:16.822 --> 19:19.283
Ah!

19:33.046 --> 19:34.798
It's toying with us.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.582
Yeah, you better run!

20:08.665 --> 20:11.293
I think he might actually
be running from that.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.672
- Again?
- We know we can't outrun it.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.966
We're not running this time.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.056
Form Voltron!

21:17.818 --> 21:18.652
Huh?

22:01.069 --> 22:04.865
What happened?
Did something come to try to kill us?

22:05.115 --> 22:06.616
You know it.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.834
It looks like that nebula carried us
thousands of light years away.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.377
So, where are we?

22:18.211 --> 22:22.716
That looks like...
I recognize these constellations!

22:24.134 --> 22:26.303
This is Earth's solar system!

22:27.846 --> 22:29.639
It's the Milky Way!

22:31.516 --> 22:32.726
Home.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.729
We made it.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.024
We're finally here.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.944
Well, what are we waiting for?

22:43.305 --> 22:49.380
