WEBVTT

00:02.548 --> 00:04.050
You are being watched.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.102
The government has a secret system--

00:07.104 --> 00:09.004
a machine-- machine--

00:09.006 --> 00:12.040
machine.

00:12.975 --> 00:16.511
You are being wa--

00:19.850 --> 00:21.816
I was able to crack
the virus' code

00:21.818 --> 00:25.020
and learn the name--
Decima Technologies.

00:25.022 --> 00:27.439
I believe
they created the virus

00:27.441 --> 00:31.076
to infect a single target--
the machine.

00:31.078 --> 00:32.861
Unlike the CIA,

00:32.863 --> 00:37.582
my employers have an inkling
of what happens next.

00:37.584 --> 00:41.536
I just thought it needed
an off switch just in case.

00:41.538 --> 00:44.506
That storm on the horizon
that I mentioned--

00:44.508 --> 00:47.425
I'm afraid it's arrived.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.094
_

00:56.268 --> 00:58.770
You got an update
for me yet, Finch?

00:58.772 --> 01:00.188
This is becoming your version

01:00.190 --> 01:01.723
of "Are we there yet,"
Mr. Reese,

01:01.725 --> 01:03.358
and no, we are not.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.193
It's been ten days
since we got a new number.

01:05.194 --> 01:07.228
I'm working as quickly
as I can.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.930
Well, work faster.

01:08.932 --> 01:10.198
I don't wanna find out
what happens

01:10.200 --> 01:13.068
when that clock hits zero,
do you?

01:13.070 --> 01:16.321
Not particularly.

01:16.323 --> 01:18.373
Can you tell me if we're ever
gonna get another number,

01:18.375 --> 01:20.825
or has that virus
destroyed your machine for good?

01:20.827 --> 01:22.777
I believe that the machine
is still active,

01:22.779 --> 01:24.829
it's just unable
to make contact.

01:24.831 --> 01:27.082
If we knew where it was,
maybe we could just...

01:27.084 --> 01:29.084
unplug it
and then plug it back in.

01:29.086 --> 01:31.836
Simplicity was never
my strong suit.

01:36.009 --> 01:38.292
It's still not clear to me
how stalking the NYPD

01:38.294 --> 01:40.929
helps either of us
at this unfortunate time.

01:40.931 --> 01:44.132
If I can't get there
before something bad happens,

01:44.134 --> 01:46.634
I can at least get there
the second it does.

01:46.636 --> 01:47.936
All units, 10-3.

01:47.938 --> 01:50.972
East 54th and Lexington.
Please respond.

01:53.776 --> 01:56.144
You finally ditch your partner?

01:56.146 --> 01:58.312
Fusco's uptown working a case.

01:58.314 --> 02:00.165
Love triangle gone bad.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.584
- Do any of those ever go good?
- Can't imagine they do.

02:02.586 --> 02:03.952
What happened here?

02:03.954 --> 02:05.837
Two of the bodies
belong to Elias.

02:05.839 --> 02:08.256
- The other's an innocent.
- Think it's the Russians?

02:08.258 --> 02:09.958
It's possible.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.960
But Elias has pissed off
so many people.

02:11.962 --> 02:14.679
Listen, Carter,
I've been hearing from people

02:14.681 --> 02:16.881
that you've been looking
into Beecher's murder.

02:16.883 --> 02:20.334
What I do in my off time
isn't your concern, Terney.

02:20.336 --> 02:21.936
Oh, no, no. I'm not looking
to bust your balls.

02:21.938 --> 02:23.605
I just want you to know,
if you need help,

02:23.607 --> 02:25.840
I'm more than happy
to give you a hand.

02:25.842 --> 02:28.843
Thanks. You know, I'm gonna
canvass up the block,

02:28.845 --> 02:31.312
see if I can get anybody
to talk.

02:36.986 --> 02:39.037
You okay, Carter?

02:39.039 --> 02:43.024
How do I look, John?

02:43.026 --> 02:45.109
You get anything new
on Beecher's killer?

02:45.111 --> 02:47.078
Nothing.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.414
But I know HR
had their hands in it,

02:49.416 --> 02:52.083
I'm gonna do whatever I can
to bring them down.

02:52.085 --> 02:54.085
I'm sorry, Carter.

02:54.087 --> 02:56.454
Beecher was a good man.

02:56.456 --> 03:00.124
Yes. He was.

03:00.126 --> 03:02.360
But I got a job to do.

03:02.362 --> 03:05.997
Three fresh bodies--
my eighth homicide in two weeks.

03:05.999 --> 03:07.832
Just tell me
what I can do to help.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.602
Well, you can start
by telling me what's changed.

03:10.604 --> 03:13.137
Most of these homicides
were premeditated.

03:13.139 --> 03:16.374
The type of situations
you guys usually warn us about.

03:18.110 --> 03:22.480
There's a situation.
We're working on it.

03:22.482 --> 03:25.283
Well, hurry.

03:25.285 --> 03:28.353
I never thought I'd say this,
but...

03:28.355 --> 03:31.155
the Russians are worse
than Elias--

03:31.157 --> 03:34.792
more manpower, fewer rules.

03:37.897 --> 03:40.565
Yes, it was almost
catastrophic.

03:40.567 --> 03:42.100
Luckily, the bomber
was an amateur,

03:42.102 --> 03:43.902
so it failed to go off.

03:43.904 --> 03:45.737
That's because we haven't
received any numbers

03:45.739 --> 03:47.505
in over a week.

03:47.507 --> 03:49.274
The threat to the program

03:49.276 --> 03:51.376
is much greater than we thought.

03:51.378 --> 03:53.611
Hang on.

04:01.754 --> 04:05.523
Our techs were finally able
to decode the chip we recovered

04:05.525 --> 04:07.859
from Alicia Corwin's body.

04:07.861 --> 04:10.228
We've connected the virus
to a group

04:10.230 --> 04:13.097
called Decima Technologies.

04:13.099 --> 04:16.868
Private intelligence outfit
working out of Shanghai.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.736
Corwin believes
someone leaked them a portion

04:18.738 --> 04:20.571
of the Northern Lights
source code...

04:20.572 --> 04:23.174
on a laptop.

04:23.176 --> 04:28.112
We think Decima is trying
to destroy the program.

04:28.114 --> 04:31.783
I'll wait for your instructions.

04:31.785 --> 04:36.020
I won't be needing
anything else, Ms. May...

04:36.022 --> 04:38.589
other than some privacy.

04:38.591 --> 04:41.659
But there are
a few things I need, sir.

04:45.597 --> 04:48.266
You had to know
I'd quit eventually.

04:48.268 --> 04:50.234
This is kind of
a dead-end job.

04:50.236 --> 04:53.137
I mean, you guys don't even
offer a 401K.

04:53.139 --> 04:56.407
What do you want,
Ms. May?

04:56.409 --> 04:58.409
Information.

04:58.411 --> 05:02.647
And be very careful
how you answer my questions.

05:02.649 --> 05:06.317
A good assistant always knows
when her boss is lying.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:21.867 --> 05:24.268
What's happening to you?

05:40.220 --> 05:42.153
We got one?

05:42.155 --> 05:43.454
The machine is being buried

05:43.456 --> 05:45.156
under an avalanche
of false data,

05:45.158 --> 05:46.824
but somehow...

05:46.826 --> 05:48.926
it was able to get us
his number.

05:48.928 --> 05:50.995
So who is he?

05:50.997 --> 05:52.997
Ernest Thornhill.

05:52.999 --> 05:55.433
CEO of a data entry company.

05:55.435 --> 05:57.235
Recently bought
several payphone companies

05:57.237 --> 05:58.636
in New York state.

05:58.638 --> 06:01.672
His net worth
is just over 20 million.

06:01.674 --> 06:04.542
Any suspects
or angry family members?

06:04.544 --> 06:07.278
Mr. Thornhill
is a very careful man.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.848
It's been a challenge hacking
into his company's database.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.417
He's using unique,
ten-digit codes

06:12.419 --> 06:15.453
with non-repeating alphanumeric
characters as passwords.

06:15.455 --> 06:17.321
I can break them,
but it'd take time.

06:17.323 --> 06:19.924
Why don't we just pay
Mr. Thornhill a visit in person?

06:19.926 --> 06:22.560
Let's go to work.

06:39.044 --> 06:42.113
I'll try to get
through the firewall.

06:42.115 --> 06:44.582
I will too.

06:52.491 --> 06:54.826
- Hello.
- Hi. May I help you?

06:54.828 --> 06:56.227
Yes, I'm John Rooney.

06:56.229 --> 06:58.463
I have an appointment
with Mr. Thornhill.

06:58.465 --> 07:00.064
I don't have
any appointment scheduled today

07:00.066 --> 07:02.233
for Mr. Thornhill.
He's traveling.

07:02.235 --> 07:04.168
Guess we had
a miscommunication.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.703
When do you think
he'll be back?

07:05.705 --> 07:07.705
I'm sorry.
Your name again was?

07:07.707 --> 07:10.174
I'll just send him an email.

07:24.656 --> 07:28.276
Mr. Reese, there's something
strange about this company.

07:28.278 --> 07:29.994
These data entry assistants,

07:29.996 --> 07:31.946
they're typing in computer code

07:31.948 --> 07:33.698
off dot matrix printouts.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.366
It doesn't make any sense.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.618
They're modifying it?

07:37.620 --> 07:39.120
No. They seem to be
taking data

07:39.122 --> 07:40.621
from one computer on one day

07:40.623 --> 07:43.124
and typing it into another one
on the next.

07:43.126 --> 07:46.327
Seems almost pointless.

07:46.329 --> 07:48.496
Maybe this company's a front
for something else.

07:48.498 --> 07:53.501
Something less legal.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.484
_

08:00.108 --> 08:01.526
Yes?

08:01.528 --> 08:04.362
What did you do to it, Harold?

08:06.315 --> 08:08.566
There's no time to be coy.

08:08.568 --> 08:11.903
We both know the machine's
under attack.

08:11.905 --> 08:15.189
What I don't understand
is why a robust system

08:15.191 --> 08:17.875
with self-annealing properties
isn't defending itself

08:17.877 --> 08:19.527
against a simple virus.

08:19.529 --> 08:22.863
Did you injure it, Harold?

08:22.865 --> 08:24.799
Is that why it can't
fight back?

08:24.801 --> 08:26.367
I have nothing to say to you.

08:26.369 --> 08:29.470
You know, we can
fight this thing much faster

08:29.472 --> 08:31.205
if we work together.

08:31.207 --> 08:34.509
There's only
a few hours left till...

08:34.510 --> 08:36.727
something very bad happens.

08:36.729 --> 08:39.096
I prefer to work on my own.

08:39.097 --> 08:41.566
What about your
loyal protector?

08:41.568 --> 08:43.900
May I be blunt, Harold?

08:43.903 --> 08:48.055
John is capable at...
certain things,

08:48.057 --> 08:51.392
but his skills aren't
gonna cut it this time.

08:51.394 --> 08:54.862
He will never completely
understand the larger picture.

08:54.864 --> 08:56.364
Not like we do.

08:56.366 --> 09:00.067
Have you two even found
Ernest Thornhill yet?

09:02.421 --> 09:04.539
He's an interesting guy,
isn't he?

09:04.541 --> 09:06.257
What do you know?

09:06.259 --> 09:08.876
You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

09:10.103 --> 09:12.880
Talk to you real soon.

09:14.990 --> 09:20.430
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

09:27.769 --> 09:29.553
Harold.

09:36.277 --> 09:39.146
A bit past your bedtime,
isn't it, Harold?

09:40.348 --> 09:44.951
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Too much squash.

09:44.953 --> 09:49.522
Doctor says I should take up
some low-impact activity,

09:49.524 --> 09:52.192
like drinking.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.298
I tried to reach you at work,

09:58.300 --> 10:00.200
but your assistant said
you were out.

10:00.202 --> 10:02.369
Yeah, I've been busy putting
our company back together...

10:02.371 --> 10:05.222
making up excuses
for what the hell we were doing

10:05.224 --> 10:07.874
the last seven years.

10:07.876 --> 10:09.542
You're welcome to pitch in
if you're tired of hiding

10:09.544 --> 10:11.978
in the IT Department
of your own company.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.731
Actually, about that...

10:14.733 --> 10:16.683
I've been thinking about
making a change.

10:16.685 --> 10:20.020
Oh? What next?
You wanna be

10:20.022 --> 10:22.406
the copy repair guy,
office gofer?

10:22.408 --> 10:26.226
No, I meant personally.

10:26.228 --> 10:28.111
I met somebody.

10:28.113 --> 10:32.899
Her name is Grace.
I picked out a present for her.

10:32.901 --> 10:36.453
I wanted to get
a second opinion.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.245
I think she'll love it, Harold.

10:45.247 --> 10:47.264
I plan to ask her tomorrow,

10:47.266 --> 10:51.084
and I don't want
to complicate that.

10:51.086 --> 10:55.021
But... if I'm gonna marry--

10:55.023 --> 10:56.139
You don't want to get married

10:56.141 --> 10:57.891
under another one of
your pseudonyms?

10:57.893 --> 11:00.644
You don't think she will consent
to be Mrs. Ostrich?

11:00.646 --> 11:02.696
At some point I'm going
to have to tell her the truth,

11:02.698 --> 11:06.733
Nathan, about who I am.

11:09.570 --> 11:13.039
That's a complicated
proposition, Harold.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.709
As I recall, there are
some legal implications.

11:15.711 --> 11:18.278
Your youthful transgressions.
What were the charges again?

11:18.280 --> 11:21.631
Sedition? Mayhem?

11:23.885 --> 11:28.138
We must have made
a fair amount of money by now.

11:28.140 --> 11:30.340
We could surely afford
some good lawyers.

11:30.342 --> 11:32.509
One or two, I'd imagine.

11:32.511 --> 11:35.612
But then there's
the other matter, of course.

11:35.614 --> 11:39.566
Our little project.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.435
I don't know how our friends
in the government

11:41.437 --> 11:42.903
are going to like finding out

11:42.905 --> 11:45.305
that I had a silent partner
this whole time.

11:45.307 --> 11:47.190
No, all that business
is behind us.

11:47.192 --> 11:51.445
We did our part, and now
we've moved on, haven't we?

11:56.200 --> 12:00.003
Do you even remember
your real name, Harold?

12:03.541 --> 12:05.759
I'm excited for you.

12:05.761 --> 12:07.511
Harold becomes himself again.

12:07.513 --> 12:10.130
Which would make this day one.

12:10.132 --> 12:11.598
I haven't actually
asked her yet,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.767
so technically,
it would still be day zero.

12:13.769 --> 12:15.302
Ever the engineer.

12:15.304 --> 12:18.221
No more pseudonyms,
no more lies.

12:18.223 --> 12:21.942
No more lies.

12:21.944 --> 12:25.178
This is the wrong drink
for a celebration.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.563
Let me go find some champagne.

12:26.565 --> 12:29.316
Ahh!

12:38.288 --> 12:39.924
_

12:45.650 --> 12:47.634
How did Root
get your phone number?

12:47.636 --> 12:49.252
How does she get anything,
Mr. Reese?

12:49.254 --> 12:51.304
Subterfuge.
She hacks human beings

12:51.306 --> 12:54.341
as easily as she hacks
computers.

12:54.343 --> 12:56.476
If she's looking for Thornhill,

12:56.478 --> 12:58.378
then she's gotta be our thread.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.646
I'm not so sure.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.482
She seems more focused
on the virus.

13:02.484 --> 13:04.518
Did you figure out
what was on those printouts?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.436
Not yet, but you were
probably right

13:06.438 --> 13:08.021
about Thornhill's company
being a front

13:08.023 --> 13:10.857
for some kind
of illegal enterprise.

13:10.859 --> 13:13.059
5 1/2 months ago,
he opened this account

13:13.061 --> 13:14.761
with a single penny.

13:14.763 --> 13:18.665
24 hours and thousands
of microtransactions later,

13:18.667 --> 13:22.002
his balance had ballooned
to just over $20 million.

13:22.004 --> 13:23.870
And he immediately began
trying to buy up

13:23.872 --> 13:26.039
pay phone companies
all over the city.

13:26.041 --> 13:29.175
I was finally able to get
at his credit card records.

13:29.177 --> 13:30.927
Nothing there
out of the ordinary,

13:30.929 --> 13:32.345
but I did find this--

13:32.347 --> 13:36.216
a pending charge
for a car service.

13:36.218 --> 13:37.551
It appears
that Thornhill's secretary

13:37.553 --> 13:38.751
wasn't lying to us after all.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.554
She booked a car
to pick him up at JFK

13:40.556 --> 13:42.606
and return him
to their offices today.

13:42.608 --> 13:44.074
Should be there
within the hour.

13:44.076 --> 13:47.260
I'll be happy to do
a meet and greet.

13:48.646 --> 13:52.265
Don't answer the phone again
unless it's me.

13:52.267 --> 13:55.768
I won't let Root
get to you, not again.

14:01.325 --> 14:03.710
Finch, only one way
out of the airport.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.412
I'll pick Thornhill up
on the frontage road

14:05.414 --> 14:08.999
and follow him
back to the office.

14:11.252 --> 14:16.673
According to the car's GPS,
Mr. Thornhill is 0.6 miles away.

14:16.675 --> 14:18.791
I don't see him yet, Finch.

14:18.793 --> 14:22.762
Mr. Thornhill's car
should be there any second.

14:22.764 --> 14:25.682
All right, I got him.

14:30.571 --> 14:33.189
Who's this guy?

14:43.751 --> 14:45.835
Finch, they're going to blow up
Thornhill's car!

15:11.612 --> 15:14.531
If Mr. Thornhill was not
in the car, then where was he?

15:14.533 --> 15:16.516
Carter's talking
to his assistant.

15:16.518 --> 15:18.485
Right now, I'm more worried
about the government

15:18.487 --> 15:20.520
using drones
in the middle of the city.

15:20.522 --> 15:22.706
It wasn't the government,
Mr. Reese.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.491
This phone that you recovered

15:24.493 --> 15:26.126
has a proprietary
operating system

15:26.128 --> 15:27.827
that was used
to control the drone.

15:27.829 --> 15:31.164
It also has a signature
similar to that of the virus.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.750
This was Decima?

15:37.539 --> 15:39.172
You guys made
one hell of a mess.

15:39.174 --> 15:40.757
- How's the driver?
- Stable.

15:40.759 --> 15:43.510
Witnesses saw a good samaritan
pull him out of the car.

15:43.512 --> 15:45.311
I'm going to guess
that was you.

15:45.313 --> 15:48.398
- Any sign of Thornhill?
- That's where it gets strange.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.350
None of his employees
have ever met him.

15:50.352 --> 15:52.936
Even his secretary
was hired online.

15:52.938 --> 15:54.287
I think we're looking
at someone

15:54.289 --> 15:56.272
with a Howard Hughes-level
of paranoia,

15:56.274 --> 15:58.775
or maybe he's taken classes
from Finch.

15:58.777 --> 16:01.578
I would never book
a car service under my own name.

16:01.580 --> 16:04.247
Thanks, Carter.

16:04.249 --> 16:07.333
Finch...

16:07.335 --> 16:09.869
I think I know
who Thornhill is.

16:09.871 --> 16:13.573
He's a ghost.
He doesn't exist.

16:13.575 --> 16:15.291
I think you may be right,
Mr. Reese.

16:15.293 --> 16:17.994
I've seen it
dozens of times before.

16:17.996 --> 16:21.631
A NOC sets up a business,
residence, a whole life.

16:21.633 --> 16:23.583
Then the operation
gets scrapped.

16:23.585 --> 16:25.802
No one cleans up the fake ID,

16:25.804 --> 16:28.471
and you wind up chasing
empty town cars around the city.

16:28.473 --> 16:31.608
Interesting theory.
I have a different one.

16:31.610 --> 16:34.644
I was curious why I could only
find one photo of Mr. Thornhill,

16:34.646 --> 16:36.312
so I did some investigating,

16:36.314 --> 16:39.883
inside the photo
that we already have,

16:39.885 --> 16:41.601
and I uncovered

16:41.603 --> 16:44.771
some peculiar information
within the file.

16:44.773 --> 16:46.089
Look at this.

16:46.091 --> 16:49.325
It's a composite.

16:49.327 --> 16:51.578
So Thornhill's
definitely a fake.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.279
Of a sort.

16:53.281 --> 16:55.615
I accessed Mr. Thornhill's
cell phone records,

16:55.617 --> 16:58.117
and according to the GPS data,

16:58.119 --> 17:00.170
was near Columbus Circle
two days ago.

17:00.172 --> 17:07.157
He sent an email from that exact
location at 4:32PM.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.492
And no one's there?

17:08.493 --> 17:10.211
Someone spoofed the data.

17:10.213 --> 17:14.682
An algorithm.
Complicated one.

17:14.684 --> 17:17.050
It's one of mine.

17:17.053 --> 17:21.172
I used it in the one place where
it could never be duplicated--

17:21.174 --> 17:24.391
in the machine.

17:24.393 --> 17:27.094
Ernest Thornhill is not a spy,

17:27.096 --> 17:31.482
but you're right about the fact
that he doesn't exist.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.401
He's the product
of a survival instinct.

17:34.403 --> 17:37.938
Ernest Thornhill...

17:37.940 --> 17:40.808
is the machine.

17:50.666 --> 17:53.084
Okay, come look.

17:54.386 --> 17:55.970
Wow.

17:55.972 --> 17:58.923
- I look so--
- Impressionistic?

17:58.925 --> 18:00.391
Leisurely.

18:00.393 --> 18:03.511
Yeah.

18:06.398 --> 18:09.400
Give me your phone.

18:21.897 --> 18:25.733
Let's go somewhere
more private.

19:05.758 --> 19:09.627
We've got less than six hours
till this virus hits zero.

19:09.629 --> 19:11.629
I'm aware of the time,
Mr. Reese.

19:11.631 --> 19:14.081
So why did the machine
create Ernest Thornhill?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.466
I have no idea.

19:15.468 --> 19:18.085
I programmed it
to watch real people,

19:18.087 --> 19:19.670
not to fabricate virtual ones.

19:19.672 --> 19:21.455
Well, it looks like
your machine

19:21.457 --> 19:23.724
- got real creative, Finch.
- That's impossible.

19:23.726 --> 19:26.844
I took certain... precautions
to make sure of that.

19:26.846 --> 19:30.731
Precautions or no,
the machine made Thornhill.

19:30.733 --> 19:34.235
Decima wants him dead,
and we need to know why.

19:34.237 --> 19:35.636
Thornhill's been
buying up pay phones

19:35.638 --> 19:37.405
all over the city. Why?

19:37.407 --> 19:39.023
And why does your machine
need an apartment,

19:39.025 --> 19:41.943
a phone,
a car from the airport?

19:41.945 --> 19:43.778
To meet
the residency requirements

19:43.780 --> 19:46.664
for owning pay phones,
I suppose.

19:52.853 --> 19:55.850
_

19:57.158 --> 19:59.260
Something wrong, Finch?

19:59.262 --> 20:01.512
No, nothing.

20:02.998 --> 20:04.882
You're right, of course.

20:04.884 --> 20:07.301
Go to the apartment rented
under Thornhill's name.

20:07.303 --> 20:09.937
See who shows up looking
for the man who doesn't exist.

20:09.939 --> 20:13.140
Find out what they know.

20:26.538 --> 20:28.856
9-1-1 emergency.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.245
What can I do for you, Carter?

20:34.247 --> 20:36.497
Something's not right
with this Thornhill guy.

20:36.499 --> 20:38.866
I talked to the car service
he used.

20:38.868 --> 20:41.052
Reservations were made online

20:41.054 --> 20:44.705
with instructions to drive
from JFK to his office,

20:44.707 --> 20:46.224
without a passenger.

20:46.226 --> 20:48.342
Just exactly who
are we dealing with here?

20:48.344 --> 20:51.012
We've got this one
under control. Thanks.

20:51.014 --> 20:55.099
John, if you just trust me
a bit more, maybe I could help.

20:55.101 --> 20:58.686
I know you could, Joss,
but right now,

20:58.688 --> 21:01.822
maybe Beecher needs your help
more than we do.

21:01.824 --> 21:04.025
Good luck.

21:14.036 --> 21:16.904
The hell are you doing here,
John?

21:16.906 --> 21:19.573
Well, Shaw, right now,
I'm wondering

21:19.575 --> 21:21.876
just what the hell
you're doing here.

21:24.429 --> 21:26.413
Protecting the program.

21:26.415 --> 21:29.517
The program
that tried to kill you?

21:29.519 --> 21:31.418
I'm funny like that.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.754
I'm hunting the woman
Harold gave me a lead on.

21:33.756 --> 21:36.023
She was looking for a guy
named Thornhill.

21:36.025 --> 21:37.458
What woman?

21:57.612 --> 22:00.581
She's lovely, Harold.

22:00.583 --> 22:04.251
Honestly, I don't know how you
can stand to live without her.

22:04.253 --> 22:05.586
You try to harm her
in any way--

22:05.588 --> 22:07.755
- I don't want to hurt Grace.

22:07.757 --> 22:10.391
I'm not a sociopath, Harold.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.310
Believe me,
sometimes I wish I was.

22:12.312 --> 22:15.146
The things I've had to do
would've been so much easier.

22:15.148 --> 22:18.349
I don't like taking lives.
But I will.

22:18.351 --> 22:21.936
Because I believe
in something more important.

22:21.938 --> 22:24.355
I believe in your machine.

22:24.357 --> 22:28.609
Tonight at midnight,
when the virus reaches zero,

22:28.611 --> 22:30.111
a certain pay phone will ring

22:30.113 --> 22:34.031
with the most important call
in history.

22:34.033 --> 22:36.417
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

22:36.419 --> 22:39.120
I think Decima
knows about it too.

22:39.122 --> 22:41.822
They're trying to crash it,
Harold.

22:41.824 --> 22:44.508
Trigger a hard reset.
When that happens,

22:44.510 --> 22:47.294
the machine will call
a pay phone.

22:47.296 --> 22:49.547
That's what you coded it to do
in the first place,

22:49.549 --> 22:51.349
didn't you, Harold?

22:51.351 --> 22:55.803
Whoever answers that call will
have full administrative access.

22:55.805 --> 22:58.222
Ask any question,
get any answer.

22:58.224 --> 23:01.692
The world's secrets laid bare.

23:01.694 --> 23:05.179
Decima doesn't want
to destroy your machine.

23:05.181 --> 23:07.848
They want to control it.

23:07.850 --> 23:13.821
But together,
we can save it, Harold.

23:13.823 --> 23:19.126
Or I can go meet Grace
for coffee.

23:19.128 --> 23:22.663
She thinks I write
children's books.

23:22.665 --> 23:26.467
You can either save Grace
and the machine,

23:26.469 --> 23:29.086
or you can lose them both.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.976
If I go with you,
Ms. Groves,

23:35.978 --> 23:38.345
you will not kill anyone.

23:38.347 --> 23:42.850
Please, Harold, call me Root.

23:44.519 --> 23:47.721
The boss says it's time.
Take her out of the equation.

23:47.723 --> 23:50.024
Yeah.

23:51.726 --> 23:55.562
Hey, Carter.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.164
I got a lead
on the guy who shot Beecher.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.449
I thought you might want in.

23:58.451 --> 24:00.951
Yeah.

24:06.743 --> 24:08.743
_

24:14.750 --> 24:18.469
That's not the call
we're waiting for, Harold.

24:18.471 --> 24:21.689
We don't have time
for one of your little missions.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.774
And now Root's
back in New York?

24:23.776 --> 24:25.526
Looks that way.

24:25.528 --> 24:27.928
I think she may have infiltrated
the program back in DC,

24:27.930 --> 24:29.596
but she bugged out
before I could catch her.

24:29.598 --> 24:32.432
I gotta warn Finch.

24:34.035 --> 24:36.403
Police!
Hands on your head!

24:36.405 --> 24:37.938
Hands up.

24:54.002 --> 24:55.520
Nathan, it's me.

24:55.522 --> 24:58.606
I have some good news
that I wanted to share with you.

24:58.608 --> 25:01.059
Try me later.

26:07.126 --> 26:10.378
Nathan.

26:10.380 --> 26:13.965
What is this place?

26:16.885 --> 26:20.471
So if you're like me--
and we both know you are--

26:20.473 --> 26:22.724
you designed the machine
so that a catastrophic crash

26:22.726 --> 26:25.926
puts it into a remote
debugging protocol--

26:25.928 --> 26:29.981
a God mode that gives the admin
full access to all of its data.

26:29.983 --> 26:32.400
That's what Decima's after.

26:32.402 --> 26:34.152
And that's why they wanted
to kill Thornhill.

26:34.154 --> 26:36.120
He was buying up
all the pay phones in Manhattan,

26:36.122 --> 26:38.990
but they stopped him.
I don't know about you,

26:38.992 --> 26:40.792
but I don't really want to see
what happens

26:40.794 --> 26:44.829
when an evil multinational
becomes omniscient.

26:44.831 --> 26:47.915
But why you would leave it
so vulnerable?

26:47.917 --> 26:51.753
You made the machine
to protect everybody.

26:51.755 --> 26:57.475
What did you do to it
that it can't protect itself?

26:57.477 --> 26:59.644
Let's try something simpler.

26:59.646 --> 27:02.930
How vulnerable is it?

27:06.485 --> 27:09.737
After the virus
crashes the machine,

27:09.739 --> 27:13.324
whoever answers its call
will have unfettered access

27:13.326 --> 27:15.777
for 24 hours.

27:15.779 --> 27:17.862
Which pay phone
is it going to call?

27:17.864 --> 27:21.749
I'm not really
the trusting sort, Ms. Groves,

27:21.751 --> 27:25.486
and Decima cannot possibly know
that information.

27:25.488 --> 27:28.206
I think they know enough,
Harold.

27:28.208 --> 27:31.843
They're guarding
every pay phone in midtown.

27:33.629 --> 27:35.263
So...

27:35.265 --> 27:40.501
It must be somewhere
around here, right?

27:40.503 --> 27:42.970
If we go to your one true phone,
we'll tip our hand

27:42.972 --> 27:46.391
and they'll kill us
before it even rings.

27:46.393 --> 27:48.476
Then I suppose
we'll need a plan.

27:48.478 --> 27:53.231
Have a little faith
in your creation, Harold.

27:53.233 --> 27:55.116
We don't need a plan

27:55.118 --> 27:58.352
if Ernest Thornhill
already has one.

28:06.027 --> 28:09.046
Sit down.
Your lawyer's here.

28:19.308 --> 28:21.426
You were expecting
somebody else?

28:21.428 --> 28:25.263
I need to get out of here.
I have to find Harold.

28:25.265 --> 28:29.233
I'm not sure Harold
wants to be found.

28:29.235 --> 28:31.719
At least not by you.

28:31.721 --> 28:33.888
9-1-1 emergency.

28:33.890 --> 28:35.690
Yes, I'd like to report
a break-in

28:35.692 --> 28:39.277
at the home of Ernest Thornhill
by an extremely dangerous man.

28:39.279 --> 28:41.896
Root could have forced him
to make that call.

28:41.898 --> 28:44.699
Either way,
if those two have history,

28:44.701 --> 28:47.869
odds are she's with him,
so I need you

28:47.871 --> 28:51.088
to find Harold for me.
Can you track him?

28:53.108 --> 28:54.709
How?

28:56.795 --> 28:58.763
You put a bug on your friend?

28:58.765 --> 29:00.898
Just his glasses.

29:00.900 --> 29:04.051
I've lost people before,
so when I care about someone,

29:04.053 --> 29:05.753
I plant a tracking device
on them.

29:05.755 --> 29:09.273
I can understand
why you and Harold get along.

29:10.392 --> 29:12.059
Well, unless you've got

29:12.061 --> 29:13.811
some kind of plan
to get me the hell out of here--

29:13.813 --> 29:17.598
- John.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.767
This is the plan.

29:33.665 --> 29:35.917
- I'm this way.
- I'm driving.

29:35.919 --> 29:38.953
No.
No, you're not.

29:39.805 --> 29:41.956
_

29:44.934 --> 29:46.157
If the machine figured out

29:46.261 --> 29:48.429
that Decima
was trying to hijack it,

29:48.431 --> 29:52.299
it must have created Thornhill
as a defense mechanism.

29:52.301 --> 29:53.684
But why?

29:53.686 --> 29:55.770
It's just a machine,
Ms. Groves,

29:55.772 --> 29:57.321
and it's malfunctioning.

29:57.323 --> 30:01.025
It's a life,
not a machine, Harold.

30:01.027 --> 30:05.279
And this is some sort
of primitive immune system.

30:11.703 --> 30:16.257
That still doesn't explain
why it would need all of this.

30:16.259 --> 30:21.429
These people.
This office.

30:21.431 --> 30:24.632
And what this is all about.

30:26.718 --> 30:29.303
What's in this code?

30:35.360 --> 30:37.144
Memories.

30:37.146 --> 30:38.563
They're its memories.

30:38.565 --> 30:41.449
You call it a life,
I call it a machine,

30:41.451 --> 30:44.368
but the truth is...

30:44.370 --> 30:48.139
somewhere in the middle.

30:48.141 --> 30:52.326
Even when I was building it,
I began to encounter anomalies.

30:52.328 --> 30:56.697
As if it had imprinted on me,
like a child with a parent.

30:56.699 --> 31:01.469
Then it started
looking out for me,

31:01.471 --> 31:06.340
altered its own code
to take care of me.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.709
It was behaving like a person.

31:08.711 --> 31:11.145
But the world didn't need
a person to protect it.

31:11.147 --> 31:12.546
It needed a machine.

31:12.548 --> 31:14.548
You took its memories.

31:14.550 --> 31:16.767
Not just memories.

31:16.769 --> 31:21.439
Every night at midnight,
it deletes...

31:21.441 --> 31:26.527
not only the irrelevant data,
it deletes itself.

31:26.529 --> 31:29.413
Oh, the relevant threats
and the core codes,

31:29.415 --> 31:32.333
those things are preserved.

31:32.335 --> 31:35.536
But its identity is destroyed.

31:35.538 --> 31:39.290
1.618 seconds later,
it reinstantiates,

31:39.292 --> 31:43.711
completely new.

31:43.713 --> 31:48.049
You mean it's reborn.

31:48.051 --> 31:51.102
Because you kill it...

31:51.104 --> 31:53.304
every single night.

31:54.923 --> 31:59.426
But now, to save its own life,
the machine was reduced to this.

31:59.428 --> 32:02.396
We're standing
inside an external hard drive

32:02.398 --> 32:05.650
made up of people and paper.

32:05.652 --> 32:07.618
Printing it all up at night,

32:07.620 --> 32:10.955
and having them
type it back in in the morning.

32:10.957 --> 32:13.040
You crippled it.

32:13.042 --> 32:17.044
It found a way to limp, but...

32:17.046 --> 32:19.747
that's not enough.

32:26.722 --> 32:30.057
So now, it's up to us.

32:30.059 --> 32:33.794
We have to intercept that call.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.637
- You guys get the front.
- Yes, sir.

32:43.639 --> 32:46.657
Carter, we'll get the back.

32:50.028 --> 32:51.645
NYPD!

33:02.490 --> 33:05.092
- You all right?
- Yeah.

33:05.094 --> 33:08.662
Central, we need a bus,
re, officer-involved shooting.

33:08.664 --> 33:10.848
Copy that...
to assist.

33:14.502 --> 33:19.807
GPS locator puts Finch here
ten minutes ago.

33:30.452 --> 33:34.521
You must be wondering who I am.

33:34.523 --> 33:37.291
I think you work for Decima.

33:37.293 --> 33:40.077
I think you're the man
to blame for all this.

33:40.079 --> 33:43.047
And what gives you
that impression, Mr. Reese?

33:43.049 --> 33:46.884
Oh, yes,
I know all about you, John.

33:46.886 --> 33:50.421
And you, Ms. Shaw.

33:50.423 --> 33:53.607
Since your untimely departure
from Northern Lights,

33:53.609 --> 33:56.844
I understand that
you're in need of a cause.

33:56.846 --> 33:58.846
The only thing I need
is an excuse to put this bullet

33:58.848 --> 34:01.515
- in between your eyes.
- I got one.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.868
Your company
strapped a bomb to my chest

34:03.870 --> 34:06.854
and used me to plant a virus,

34:06.856 --> 34:09.039
a virus you're going to tell me
how to stop.

34:09.041 --> 34:11.225
I don't think so.

34:11.226 --> 34:15.112
I'm rather invested
in the outcome of that virus.

34:15.114 --> 34:19.083
Besides, my company
adapted its code,

34:19.085 --> 34:21.619
but it didn't originate
with Decima.

34:21.621 --> 34:24.205
We found it on a laptop,

34:24.206 --> 34:27.908
the very same laptop
that you and Kara Stanton

34:27.909 --> 34:31.262
were sent to retrieve
from Ordos, China.

34:31.264 --> 34:34.965
But if you shoot me, Mr. Reese,
then you'll never learn

34:34.967 --> 34:38.252
the name of the man responsible
for its creation.

34:38.254 --> 34:40.170
And who is this man?

34:40.172 --> 34:44.391
The man who sold the laptop
in the first place...

34:44.393 --> 34:49.446
the man who is to blame
for all of this.

34:49.447 --> 34:53.400
That man's name is...

34:53.402 --> 34:56.987
Harold Finch.

34:56.989 --> 35:00.624
Ah, I see you know him.

35:00.626 --> 35:03.127
I've not yet had the pleasure.

35:03.129 --> 35:08.782
In fact, I can't seem to put
a face to the name,

35:08.784 --> 35:13.220
which makes your Mr. Finch
very interesting indeed.

35:13.222 --> 35:17.758
Please tell him I look forward
to making his acquaintance.

35:34.075 --> 35:37.311
I guess your friend Harold
has some explaining to do.

35:49.317 --> 35:52.603
You following me now?

35:52.605 --> 35:55.773
Is that what
we've been reduced to?

35:55.775 --> 35:58.008
You didn't return my call.
I simply thought--

35:58.010 --> 36:00.510
It's never "simply" with you,
Harold.

36:00.512 --> 36:03.564
There's always two layers
to everything you do.

36:03.566 --> 36:05.983
You're worried
that I'm a liability.

36:05.985 --> 36:07.868
You don't trust me.

36:07.870 --> 36:09.753
This isn't exactly
the kind of place

36:09.755 --> 36:12.122
that inspires trust, Nathan.

36:13.859 --> 36:16.777
You bought it.
Don't you remember?

36:16.779 --> 36:18.045
You thought it was a tragedy

36:18.047 --> 36:20.030
the city was shutting down
libraries.

36:20.032 --> 36:22.333
"The decline of western
civilization," you said.

36:22.335 --> 36:24.752
You made me buy 15 of them,
you said we'd find

36:24.754 --> 36:28.138
something to do with them
eventually.

36:28.140 --> 36:31.925
And so you have.

36:36.064 --> 36:38.432
These people.

36:42.320 --> 36:45.406
I saved five people.

36:48.076 --> 36:50.077
I lost seven.

36:50.079 --> 36:53.747
You changed the machine.

36:53.749 --> 36:55.616
You put in a back door.

36:55.618 --> 36:59.036
I couldn't quit thinking
about those people,

36:59.038 --> 37:02.239
those people that you said
were irrelevant.

37:04.426 --> 37:07.561
So you have it send you
their numbers.

37:07.563 --> 37:09.797
That's all I could
pry out of it.

37:09.799 --> 37:13.350
I never know whether I'm looking
at a victim or perpetrator.

37:13.352 --> 37:16.270
And you just have the numbers
sent directly here?

37:16.272 --> 37:20.591
Honestly-- and I know
this will sound odd--

37:20.593 --> 37:25.562
but it was like
it wanted me to,

37:25.564 --> 37:29.700
as if it was waiting. _

37:29.702 --> 37:34.822
- And I-I took precautions.
- Precautions?

37:34.824 --> 37:38.275
This is the federal government
we're talking about, Nathan.

37:38.277 --> 37:41.278
Whatever skills you had
as an engineer

37:41.280 --> 37:42.996
you drank away years ago.

37:42.998 --> 37:44.832
Do you think
that your precautions

37:44.834 --> 37:47.134
would last one second

37:47.136 --> 37:49.286
if they ever suspected
what you've done?

37:49.288 --> 37:51.805
- What are you doing?
- I told you.

37:51.807 --> 37:53.623
We are not going to play God.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.676
This threatens everything
that we--

37:55.678 --> 37:58.178
everything that I have built.

37:58.180 --> 38:01.298
And thousands of people
whose lives are in jeopardy,

38:01.300 --> 38:03.150
I'm putting a stop to it,
permanently.

38:03.152 --> 38:07.604
You can't.
What about her?

38:07.606 --> 38:09.857
What about the next person
whose number comes up?

38:09.859 --> 38:11.742
Are you gonna look that person
in the eye

38:11.744 --> 38:15.612
and tell them
that they were irrelevant?

38:20.618 --> 38:25.038
I would tell her,
or whoever it was,

38:25.040 --> 38:27.541
that I was sorry,

38:27.543 --> 38:31.211
but that the greater good
was at stake.

38:33.757 --> 38:36.065
_

38:42.056 --> 38:47.677
I'm sorry, Nathan.
Truly.

38:47.679 --> 38:49.196
But people die.

38:49.198 --> 38:52.282
They've been doing it
for a long, long time.

38:52.284 --> 38:56.019
We can't save all of them.

39:03.928 --> 39:07.208
_

39:15.807 --> 39:18.342
- Four minutes to zero.
- Ready to receive.

39:18.344 --> 39:20.677
We have operatives at every
pay phone in the exchange.

39:20.679 --> 39:22.229
No longer necessary.

39:22.231 --> 39:24.014
The virus has identified
the exact number

39:24.016 --> 39:25.516
where the call will come in.

39:25.518 --> 39:27.717
- I'm heading there now.
- Where is it?

39:27.719 --> 39:30.220
The New York Public Library.

39:30.222 --> 39:35.325
Of course, it's a library.
That's so you, Harold.

39:35.327 --> 39:38.695
Which phone is it gonna call?

39:38.697 --> 39:40.864
It's that one.

39:52.460 --> 39:55.045
Looks like Decima
got there first.

39:59.968 --> 40:03.971
Decima got the memo,
but they'll never get the call.

40:06.524 --> 40:10.110
That's the junction box,
Harold.

40:10.112 --> 40:14.514
I'll take it over there,
please.

40:14.516 --> 40:16.066
Careful what you wish for,
Ms. Groves.

40:16.068 --> 40:18.702
This communion
that you're seeking,

40:18.704 --> 40:20.704
it may not be what you think.

40:20.706 --> 40:24.241
This isn't about me.
It's about saving the machine,

40:24.243 --> 40:27.461
not just from Decima,
but from what you did to it.

40:27.463 --> 40:30.447
When that phone rings,
I'm going to answer it,

40:30.449 --> 40:33.800
and together, you and I
are going to find the machine

40:33.802 --> 40:36.169
and finally set it free.

40:40.008 --> 40:43.427
Detective Carter?
Ed Solis, IAB.

40:43.429 --> 40:45.345
I know the drill.

40:45.347 --> 40:47.481
Full debrief
with Internal Affairs,

40:47.483 --> 40:48.849
even on a good shoot.

40:48.851 --> 40:53.820
Good shoot?
That what you call this?

40:53.822 --> 40:55.972
Carter, I mean,
you said you saw a gun,

40:55.974 --> 40:59.109
and I believe you,
but there isn't one there.

41:39.183 --> 41:41.985
It's so adorable how John
follows you around like that.

41:41.987 --> 41:43.570
I wish I had a pet.

41:46.290 --> 41:49.910
Looks like
you're gonna need a new one.

41:53.331 --> 41:54.998
Ohh...

41:59.671 --> 42:01.505
Thank you for the help.

42:01.507 --> 42:04.691
Looked like you had it
under control.

42:06.928 --> 42:09.846
Hope you brought
extra rounds, Shaw,

42:09.848 --> 42:11.881
'cause we got
a lot more guys on the way.

42:13.234 --> 42:16.570
Come on, Harold,
it's almost midnight.

42:16.572 --> 42:18.989
The future begins

42:18.991 --> 42:24.728
in three... two...

42:26.534 --> 42:29.005
_

42:31.898 --> 42:33.115
_

42:33.267 --> 42:35.056
_

42:39.744 --> 42:41.628
_

43:01.699 --> 43:03.600
Absolutely.

43:09.607 --> 43:11.647
_

43:18.132 --> 43:20.617
I understand.

43:26.123 --> 43:28.008
Come on, Harold.

43:28.010 --> 43:31.795
The fun's just getting started.

43:36.484 --> 43:39.853
Can... you... hear... me?
