WEBVTT

00:20.895 --> 00:22.272
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:22.355 --> 00:24.232
Why was Saanvi at the precinct that day?

00:24.315 --> 00:25.150
I'll tell you why.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.735
She was there because her and Vance

00:26.818 --> 00:28.987
were involved in the murder
of Sarah's mom, weren't they?

00:29.070 --> 00:31.489
-I don't know how to repay you.
-How about the truth?

00:31.573 --> 00:34.701
<i>You think I'm an idiot?</i>
<i>The side investigations you got going on?</i>

00:34.784 --> 00:37.287
They can cost more than just your job.
They can cost my job.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.747
That's not gonna happen, Diaz.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.167
I don't wanna get dragged down
further than you already are. Understood?

00:42.250 --> 00:43.084
Yeah.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.463
You want me to get you out of prison?
How do you want me to do that, Eagan?

00:46.546 --> 00:47.380
You're a smart guy.

00:47.464 --> 00:51.760
You'll find a way, or I'll die in here
and take Eden's location with me.

00:51.843 --> 00:56.056
You and I are connected
in a way other passengers aren't,

00:56.139 --> 00:58.183
and I think Eden
is part of this connection.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.935
Why don't you come with me to Egypt?

01:01.019 --> 01:02.312
I wish I could.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.897
Just don't give up on me.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.457
Body's pretty burned, Captain,

01:22.540 --> 01:25.251
but I'm guessing cause of death
had something to do

01:25.335 --> 01:27.462
with the five bullet holes in her torso.

01:27.545 --> 01:31.049
Let's fast-track the autopsy
and get the rounds over to Ballistics.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.134
What the hell happened here?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.472
An anonymous tip came in from an inmate.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.227
And the inmate said he knew
where Eden was and gave us an address.

01:42.310 --> 01:46.022
That address led us to a factory,
and my brother and I started searching.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.025
And that's when we heard someone,
a child's voice,

01:49.526 --> 01:51.319
and we followed that behind a corner.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.321
There she was. Eden.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.282
You know, she'd been missing
for two years, so she's…

01:57.367 --> 01:59.577
she's changed a lot, but it's my daughter.

02:00.120 --> 02:00.995
We found her.

02:01.079 --> 02:05.125
She had no idea where she'd been.
She was in shock, and she still is.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.876
And Angelina Meyer?

02:06.960 --> 02:10.171
We don't know what happened to Angelina,
whether she's alive or dead.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.631
It's not our focus. Eden is.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.341
It's quite the coincidence though.

02:13.424 --> 02:17.929
Your niece appearing the same night
an 828 compound went up in a fireball.

02:18.012 --> 02:21.057
We were on the other side of the city,
finding Eden.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.184
Can we be done?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.854
-So I'm asking all of you, please.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.232
My family's been through a lot.
My young daughter's…

02:33.278 --> 02:37.740
my young daughter's been through a lot.
So please respect her privacy. Thank you.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.868
What about Angelina Meyer?

02:50.378 --> 02:51.212
Mommy!

02:58.970 --> 03:00.054
You're alive?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.514
Oh God, help me.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.642
Come inside, quick.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.615
How is she?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.283
Finally resting.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.370
Since when do you do laundry?

03:24.454 --> 03:28.416
I'm just cleaning out the room for a bit
so Eden feels like she has her own space.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.792
You look exhausted.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.795
What's going on with you?

03:34.714 --> 03:35.924
During the explosion,

03:36.841 --> 03:38.009
I had this Calling.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.185
-It's not enough.
-What does that mean?

03:47.268 --> 03:50.730
The Lifeboat is sinking,
and we are helpless to stop it.

03:50.813 --> 03:54.734
No. You're not, okay?
You are not helpless.

03:54.817 --> 03:58.363
In order to save the Lifeboat,
you have to follow the Callings. Okay?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.782
-You just need to remember.
-I <i>am </i>following the Callings.

04:00.865 --> 04:05.411
This one made it crystal clear
that our memories, our Callings,

04:05.495 --> 04:07.914
they're not enough
to balance out the shit that's coming.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.832
They're not enough to save the Lifeboat.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.127
Okay. Well, then you try.
All right? You don't give up.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.128
Ever.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.592
-You said "shit."

04:20.134 --> 04:21.928
-Don't tell Dad.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.391
Mommy?

04:28.601 --> 04:29.894
It's okay. It's just Daddy.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.022
It's all right. She just needs
to get used to her surroundings.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.067
It's all new to her. She just needs time.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.446
I'll see if I can find
some of her old baby things.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.365
Something familiar.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.625
How about one time
we don't respond to a Registry SOS?

04:52.709 --> 04:54.877
What's the matter, Diaz?
You afraid of the country?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.879
I figure we can go antiquing later.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.215
I break out into a rash
when I leave the Bronx.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.677
What the hell you doing here?

05:03.177 --> 05:05.805
You're not Registry. Get back to the beat.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.140
You know that guy?

05:07.765 --> 05:08.933
Unfortunately.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.935
Thanks for lending a hand, guys.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.022
A lot of beat cops
won't come this far out of the city.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.400
Anything beats writing parking tickets
for the 129, Captain.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.402
-Pleasure helping out.
-Thanks.

05:19.485 --> 05:23.072
Look, could you do me a favor?
I gotta get these into the city ASAP.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.824
I can't spare my CSU guys.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.369
-Can one of you drop these at Ballistics?
-Yeah, I gotcha.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.164
Thanks. Autopsy's gonna take a minute.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.875
I'm hoping to jump-start
the investigation with the shell casings.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.918
See if we can't match them to a gun.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.670
Yeah, no problem. We got it.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.132
Actually, if you could stick around,
could use the hands here.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.387
Yeager Garden Center?

05:46.971 --> 05:49.474
I'm guessing it's no accident
we went antiquing today.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.353
What aren't you telling me, Vasquez?
What's going on?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.064
I gotta go, bro.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.500
Zeke!

06:24.509 --> 06:25.468
Hey, bud.

06:27.053 --> 06:27.970
You okay?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.391
Uh, yeah, a lot of smoke
in the air last night.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.185
-You don't sound good.
-Dude, I'm-- I'm fine.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.773
Hey, for real.
You know you can talk to me, right?

06:38.856 --> 06:40.691
And you know you can talk to me.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.153
You absorbed a boatload of rage yesterday.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.949
Okay, you're right. Yeah, I did.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.579
I never thought
I'd be responsible for taking a life.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.709
-After Chloe, I really thought--
-Hey. Chloe was not your fault.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.463
There's no question
about this one, is there?

07:04.841 --> 07:05.842
I gotta get to work.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.927
Hey, you sure that's a good idea?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.471
Yeah, I'll be fine. Can't miss my train.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.707
I got you your phone back.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.077
How much does the Registry know?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.954
Not much. Yet.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.499
All of Adrian's little helpers
are sticking to the same story.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.750
It's under control.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.711
We know it's better for the world
to think Xers did this, not a passenger.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.964
You saw it for yourself.
This was a chaotic scene.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.300
All right, lots of witnesses.
This isn't fixable.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.220
Not even for you.
Especially not with these.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.305
The shell casings. Good work.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.142
I am taking these to Ballistics.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.479
If your gun has ever been test-fired,
the system will pull a match.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.105
It hasn't been. Okay?

08:43.898 --> 08:44.857
I should be fine.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.276
You can't leave this to chance.
Do the right thing!

08:47.360 --> 08:50.613
You've cleaned up messes for so long,
you don't even know what right is anymore.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.615
Your moral compass is screwed up.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.993
Get one thing straight.
My compass points true north.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.454
-Now, maybe we don't agree--
-I'm done here.

08:59.830 --> 09:00.915
Vasquez!

09:03.626 --> 09:05.628
If I were you, I'd lose those casings.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.965
You're not me.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.972
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.349
-Have you… have you seen Zeke?
-He just went to work.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.352
I was hoping he would give it a minute.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.188
I'm worried about him.
Yesterday was a lot.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.273
Yeah.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.483
-How's Eden?

09:28.985 --> 09:32.446
Confused, upset.
I'm trying to find a way to connect.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.743
She's here where she belongs.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.418
You never gave up hope. I'm sorry. I--

09:45.501 --> 09:46.669
No, hey.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.047
My baby girl's home.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.718
All right? That is all that matters.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.847
If I go to the Registry,
will they buy the story?

09:58.931 --> 09:59.932
Ish.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.184
No one's refuting our version,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.478
but the caseworker kept asking
about Angelina,

10:04.562 --> 10:06.355
so I guess they haven't found her body.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.982
There's no way she survived that.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.318
Until she's in the morgue,
we should keep our guard up.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.360
Yeah.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.489
I did have a Calling though.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.951
In front of the caseworker,
and I almost got caught.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.746
What was it? Angelina?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.540
I'm not sure,
but the floor, it turned to glass.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.334
Below it, there was a bunch of water,

10:26.417 --> 10:30.546
and it was filled with colorful fish,
plants, bubbles…

10:30.630 --> 10:32.506
Like an aquarium.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.674
Yeah, does that ring bells?

10:33.758 --> 10:37.553
There's a passenger who owns
an aquarium supply company with his wife.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.390
Sam.

10:42.808 --> 10:43.934
Sam Wile.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.395
34D.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.399
Wile.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.234
Sam Wile.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.497
-You gonna be okay without me?
-Lifeboat needs you.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.956
Besides, let's give Eden a day

11:06.040 --> 11:07.708
before Aunt Mick fills her
with cotton candy

11:07.792 --> 11:09.335
and takes her on the Tilt-a-Whirl.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.004
That was one time. Okay? Lesson learned.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.303
Hey! I, uh, heard you went in today.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.389
-Is everything okay?
-<i>Have to be.</i>

11:21.472 --> 11:23.766
-Full house today.
-<i>Come on. Take the day off.</i>

11:23.849 --> 11:26.477
Last night, that was… that was a lot.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.603
I'm fine.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.189
And you said yourself my patients need me.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.025
Yeah, I know, but just be careful, okay?

11:33.109 --> 11:37.613
There's a lot of pain in the world,
and you can't take it all on.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.824
I love you.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.868
I love you, okay?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.890
Sam? It's Michaela Stone!

12:06.350 --> 12:07.393
Sam?

12:53.689 --> 12:56.192
I'm drawing something for my mommy.

12:58.444 --> 13:02.031
Every time she calls Angelina "Mommy,"
I just… I can't.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.074
And she pierced her ears.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.660
Mom would've hated that.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.330
Has she drawn anything
that might be a Calling?

13:09.413 --> 13:10.831
I don't think so.

13:11.457 --> 13:15.294
But I've been thinking about
Saanvi's theory. Callings being memories?

13:15.377 --> 13:17.713
From our time in the glow.
The divine consciousness.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.633
Yeah, and like what you said earlier,

13:20.716 --> 13:23.886
about how you don't have enough
to save the Lifeboat?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.763
-Uh-huh.
-Well, Eden was never in the glow.

13:25.846 --> 13:30.392
So she doesn't have any memories
to pull from, yet she gets Callings.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.727
Okay, which means…

13:31.811 --> 13:35.481
There must be another way to get
information from the divine consciousness.

13:36.941 --> 13:37.900
Hey.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.863
Hey, you okay?

13:43.447 --> 13:47.785
Mm. Yeah, just, uh, stood up too fast.
We'll be right here if you need us.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.869
All right.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.835
Hey, sweetheart.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.962
Look at all these toys.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.964
Got some of your old toys.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.466
Look at this. Look at this guy.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.218
Do you remember him?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.221
Look, look, look, look, look, look.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.098
A boat.

14:10.015 --> 14:10.975
It says "Eden."

14:11.976 --> 14:13.102
See that?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.187
My mommy says you're a bad man.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.023
Bad man! Bad man!

14:22.444 --> 14:24.738
Leave me alone! I want my mommy!

14:32.246 --> 14:33.205
Hey.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.750
Thanks for coming.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.629
Sure. 828 crime scenes
seem to be my thing.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.678
-You know him?
-No, a Calling led me here.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.472
The X. You thinking hate crime?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.057
Maybe. Or a misdirect.

14:52.641 --> 14:53.475
Holy shit.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.728
I know this guy.

14:55.811 --> 14:59.690
Lock them up!

15:06.280 --> 15:07.364
-Please.
-Hey!

15:07.448 --> 15:09.575
Please. Just… just let me through!

15:09.658 --> 15:10.826
Watch it, freak!

15:16.665 --> 15:17.708
NYPD!

15:18.542 --> 15:21.837
Hey, Vasquez from 129. Tone it down, man.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.173
What's wrong with you?
He's not hurting anyone.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.468
-Who cares? He's a passenger.
-It doesn't make him a criminal!

15:27.551 --> 15:28.844
Sure as hell makes him a freak.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.597
-Hey, man. You all right?
-Yeah.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.184
My wife should be here soon.
Seems to be the new normal.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.101
Get used to it.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.272
-Lock them up!

15:40.898 --> 15:43.108
Lock them up!

15:45.235 --> 15:48.364
He had a wedding band.
I remember because it was unusual.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.741
Yeah, Ben said he was married.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.621
Wait. Careful. Don't touch anything.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.791
Right. Right, thanks.

15:58.874 --> 16:02.044
I was gonna touch everything.
Totally forgot how the crime scene works.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.629
Okay, Detective.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.968
When we were partners,
there was no one better.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.304
We were first to the crime scene.
We could… we could work this case.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.473
We could be one step ahead
of the Registry.

16:14.556 --> 16:18.852
We have Drea call the wife in
for an interview at the Registry,

16:18.936 --> 16:21.981
and we… waylay her outside.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.775
You're trouble still.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.361
I'm in.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.574
<i>Today, on the 828-Gate podcast,</i>

16:32.658 --> 16:35.536
<i>Aaron Glover discusses</i>
<i>passenger Eagan Tehrani,</i>

16:35.619 --> 16:39.415

<i>after reportedly providing--</i>

16:41.208 --> 16:42.251
You okay, Dad?

16:44.586 --> 16:47.131
Eden's home.
As far as she knows, she's a hostage.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.092
I hate that I scare her.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.053
If this is what she thinks
a bad man looks like,

16:53.929 --> 16:55.472
it's time to lose the beard.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.268
What? You think I should keep
the mountain man look?

17:00.728 --> 17:03.605
No. No. Definitely not.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.531
What's wrong?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.493
It's just…

17:17.536 --> 17:20.122
all the times I've had a beard,
your mom's always helped.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.250
Yeah.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.227
I see so much of her in you.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.108
That was the best compliment
you could have ever given me.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.196
Okay.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.449
-Now don't slit my throat.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.003
I'll miss you the most, Scarecrow.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.028
What the hell?

18:34.905 --> 18:36.698
I was midstream!

18:39.701 --> 18:42.621
You were the only one
who knew she was there.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.123
You ratted me out!

18:44.206 --> 18:46.750
You sent the cops,
and she blew the whole place up!

18:46.834 --> 18:48.544
I lost everything!

18:49.878 --> 18:52.005
All I wanted to do was help passengers.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.091
I'm a passenger.

18:57.010 --> 19:01.849
Besides, maybe you should blame
the psycho who torched your private Idaho.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.685
Unless she's been
reduced to dental records.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.769
No.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.563
She got out.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.856
I helped her.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.404
I dropped her off
at some estate in Westchester.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.990
And after all I did for her,
she didn't let me stay.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.658
Not even for a night.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.289
She's hiding in Westchester?
As in lifestyle of the rich and fascist?

19:25.372 --> 19:26.665
It can't last anyway.

19:27.749 --> 19:28.834
She'll slip up.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.794
And when she does,

19:32.045 --> 19:33.797
someone's gonna cash in.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.675
Twenty G's?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.927
Way to bury the lead.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.390
I'm not giving up her location.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.852
No more betrayals.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.896
No more betrayals.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.576
Mrs. Wile.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.663
Officer Vasquez, NYPD.
Can we just talk to you for a few minutes?

20:07.289 --> 20:10.918
I'm a passenger.
I was, um… I was on the plane with Sam.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.878
I'm really sorry for your loss.

20:12.961 --> 20:16.381
Do you know what happened?
They just said that Sam is…

20:18.425 --> 20:19.259
gone.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.970
I'm sorry. We can't say.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.140
Ma'am, when's the last time
you saw your husband?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.602
Ex-husband. We divorced six months ago.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.062
Can I ask why--

20:30.145 --> 20:32.981
This won't make sense,
but he was too kind.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.360
Constantly took people in off the street.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.488
He gave so much of himself to everyone.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.531
He started taking cash
out of the business.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.700
I assume to help someone.

20:47.913 --> 20:52.542
Were either of you seeing anyone?
You know, since the divorce or before?

20:52.626 --> 20:55.254
No, he wasn't ready.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.632
He still wears his wedding ring
to this day.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.470
You must think I'm an awful person.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.389
No, I understand.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.225
Thank you for talking to us.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.860
I think we can cross her off the list.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.321
The missing wedding ring,
that means it could've been

21:21.405 --> 21:22.781
a straight-up robbery, but…

21:24.324 --> 21:25.534
the money's interesting.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.370
Uh, Drea says
CSU's processing Sam's house.

21:28.453 --> 21:32.582
Nothing so far. No prints. No weapons.
You're right to chase motive here.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.794
Call Drea and have her
pull up all the bank records.

21:35.877 --> 21:40.007
I have to, uh, head up and drop these off.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.142
Thank you for coming.
I wasn't sure who else to call.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.854
I, uh… I got a few things.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.231
Some clothes.

21:57.190 --> 22:00.444
I'm just trying to find some way
to reach Eden so she feels safe.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.696
And since she stayed with you, I thought--

22:02.779 --> 22:05.615
I don't know how you find it in you
to show such grace.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.785
After all you've been through.

22:09.786 --> 22:13.915
I learned from a… very, very good woman.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.840
Maybe you can help her understand
who her family is and who isn't.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.468
Of course.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.511
I'll be right outside.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.432
Mommy?

22:31.099 --> 22:35.437
Oh, no. It's just me, honey.
Oh, I missed you.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.195
Get the hell away from my car!

22:43.278 --> 22:46.490
Whoa! Whoa, easy there, Tammy Faye.
I'm looking for Angelina.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.451
Petite thing, eyebrows maybe
a little singed. Is she around?

22:49.534 --> 22:52.120
Like I told the other officers,
my daughter is dead!

22:52.204 --> 22:53.080
Mm-hmm.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.623
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.666
There's a handful of people
who know that's a lie,

22:56.750 --> 22:59.211
and two of them are standing right here.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.964
I'm not a cop.
I was on that plane, just like her.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.842
What do you want?

23:06.343 --> 23:07.844
It's not so much what I want.

23:07.928 --> 23:08.970
It's what you <i>need.</i>

23:09.638 --> 23:10.931
My silence.

23:11.014 --> 23:14.559
Your daughter's still on the lam for…
Let me check my notes. Murder.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.687
With just a smidge of kidnapping.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.941
All I want is the reward money.
I don't care where it comes from.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.735
You don't play ball, the Registry will.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.487
We just wanna be left alone.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.533
But my husband handles the accounts,
and he's on business till next week.

23:30.158 --> 23:33.286
I'm thinking of a slightly more
compressed timeline, as in now.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.371
Is this an S-Class?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.416
You're delusional.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.216
Kind of a gas guzzler anyway.
I'm more of an all-electric kind of guy.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.510
Just let my daughter be.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.684
I think you were on your way.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.061
Yep. Look at the time.

24:00.063 --> 24:00.981
You know,

24:01.815 --> 24:03.275
I could use a ride.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.834
Just breathe like we did last time.
In and out.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.003
I'm about to lose my shit.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.505
Your withdrawal is manifesting as anger.

24:26.089 --> 24:28.592
Trust me. I know anger.
I used to drive a cab.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.420
What the hell, psycho? Help! Help me!

25:05.504 --> 25:08.131
Get off! Zeke, stop it!

25:08.215 --> 25:09.674
No…

25:09.758 --> 25:11.843
Zeke, I don't even know what to say.

25:11.927 --> 25:12.928
I'm sorry.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.888
I think you need to get your things.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.770
Hey, so we've got Sam's financials.
Typical spending pattern.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.813
But over the last six months,
something changed.

25:23.897 --> 25:27.400
Yeah, on the second of every month,
he withdrew two grand, cash.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.529
-That's when the rent was due or…
-No, accounted for already.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.573
His Registry appointment. His check-in
was on the 2nd of every month.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.242
And his last withdrawal?

25:35.825 --> 25:36.868
Yesterday.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.995
<i>Okay, so every month, like clockwork,</i>

25:39.079 --> 25:42.290
Sam withdraws two grand in cash
and then goes to check in.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.793
Guys, it's someone on the inside.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.338
<i>Which means the Registry's</i>
<i>investigation is compromised.</i>

25:48.421 --> 25:50.298
-It's on us. I gotta keep digging.
-Yeah.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.342
Mick, I'll meet you downstairs
so we can game-plan.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.139
Officer Vasquez,

25:59.099 --> 26:01.226
we're gonna need you
to surrender your service weapon.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.147
Why do you need my gun?

26:06.231 --> 26:09.234
The ME just pulled half a dozen
124-grain hollow points

26:09.317 --> 26:10.610
from Erika Burness.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.572
Standard NYPD issue,
and we have reason to believe

26:13.655 --> 26:16.032
you were at the compound
at the time of the shooting.

26:20.245 --> 26:23.081
Brings me no joy to do this
to a fellow cop.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.500
Have Ballistics put a rush on this.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.502
You want my advice?

26:28.378 --> 26:31.047
Go home. Call a union rep.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.142
Hello.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.520
Who is this?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.189
-<i>How's my little girl?</i>

26:48.273 --> 26:49.149
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

26:50.066 --> 26:51.651
I just… I just wanna talk to Eden.

26:52.777 --> 26:53.987
You should be dead.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.323
You need to be dead.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.241
This is when she takes her nap.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.536
<i>She really likes her schedule.</i>
<i>Make her a glass of warm milk.</i>

27:01.620 --> 27:03.663
I'm not taking advice from you
about my own daughter.

27:03.747 --> 27:04.789
With a little cinnamon.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.082
<i>It helps her to sleep.</i>

27:06.166 --> 27:07.250
Don't ever call me again.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.419
I'm the only family that Eden knows!

27:32.901 --> 27:34.194
It's over, Mick.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.907
They're gonna test-fire my gun
against the bullets and the casings.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.241
So they will match.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.953
No, Zeke pulled the trigger.
You are not gonna lie for him or for me.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.499
Mick, I'm done, okay?
I'm not lying for you or anyone else.

27:48.541 --> 27:52.462
-I'm just gonna let the chips fall.
-Well, they're gonna fall on you, Jared.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.756
I'm gonna trust my moral compass on this.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.716
This is what it's telling me to do.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.393
<i>Oye! Oye! Oye!</i> Leave your uncle alone, eh?

28:06.476 --> 28:10.271
It takes him all week to recover
from family dinners. <i>Campeón!</i>

28:10.355 --> 28:11.856
Where do they get the energy?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.734
Their dads. Boundless, both of them.

28:15.318 --> 28:17.529
So, when is it your turn?

28:17.612 --> 28:18.905
It's not happening.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.116
You just need to find the right girl.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.035
You got the job. You're the best detective
in the department.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.287
I mean, who else makes
lieutenant in less than--

28:26.371 --> 28:27.497
Papa.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.916
I've got something I gotta tell you.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.130
This is hard. Um…

28:36.631 --> 28:39.175
I stuck my nose
where it didn't belong, Dad.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.388
I tried to help an 828er.

28:43.471 --> 28:46.224
And I teed off on an asshole.
I punched him in the face.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.269
Dad.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.104
He was a cop.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.983
They took my gold shield.

28:55.984 --> 28:56.985
When did this happen?

28:57.068 --> 28:58.361
A couple weeks ago.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.742
Why didn't you tell me before?

29:04.701 --> 29:06.995
Because this job, Dad,
it means so much to you.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.706
Making detective, lieutenant.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.377
I've lost a lot in my life.

29:15.211 --> 29:19.007
The only thing I have left
is your respect,

29:19.966 --> 29:21.760
and I can't lose that too.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.304
Have you lost a lot?

29:25.388 --> 29:28.141
Yeah. More than any man should.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.519
But you haven't lost my respect.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.856
I couldn't be prouder of who you are.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.656
Yeah, Drea,
please tell me you got something.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.576
Hey, check this out.
Every time Sam came out of the Registry,

29:46.659 --> 29:48.119
he was pulled in for questioning.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.622
Every time?
What were they questioning him on?

29:50.705 --> 29:52.040
<i>It's far too confidential.</i>

29:52.123 --> 29:55.585
But get this. Every entry is coded
with the investigator's initials.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.170
<i>Same investigator every time.</i>

29:57.253 --> 29:58.338
Ted Colvin.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.383
-That's the guy who just took my gun.
-<i>Yep.</i>

30:02.467 --> 30:04.803
Since when does a captain do casework?

30:04.886 --> 30:06.179
Exactly.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.808
He just ran over to the crime lab.
So I'm gonna poke around his office.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.352
Drea, be careful. We've got no idea
what this guy's capable of.

30:16.481 --> 30:20.276
She's still upset,
but I'm sure that will change in time.

30:20.360 --> 30:24.072
Thank you for trying.
This is… this is just hell.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.200
Well, I am happy to come back
as often as you need.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.541
I hate what 828 has done to us.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.842
See, this is a good one.

30:43.925 --> 30:48.638
The Oracle of Delphi wore sapphires
to help clarify her visions.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.851
Like your earrings.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.693
Dad, I was just reading
about the Oracle of Delphi,

31:01.776 --> 31:04.195
and… and she wore sapphires.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.739
You know what, Ol? Not today.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.783
No mythology. No Callings.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.036
Let's just work on
what's right in front of us.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.830
I wanna show Eden the new me.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.792
What do you think, Eden? No beard.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.129
See? I'm not a bad man.
I'm just your daddy.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.338
I want my mommy.

32:10.678 --> 32:13.890
That's a lot of cash for a cop.
I'm not sure we can connect it though.

32:18.978 --> 32:19.938
Okay.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.708
<i>Oh my God.</i>

32:41.918 --> 32:42.752
-Hey.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.712
Drea, that's Sam's ring.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.839
-Oh, got him.
-<i>Drea, you gotta be careful.</i>

32:46.923 --> 32:49.467
We do not know who's involved
or how high up this goes.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.428
I'm out. I'm already heading up
to Internal Affairs. I'll call you back.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.198
Hey, Mikami!

33:13.783 --> 33:15.451
-Captain.
-Where you going?

33:16.035 --> 33:18.871
I'm just heading up to Records.
Uh, do you need anything?

33:18.955 --> 33:20.164
Just that ring.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.304
You don't wanna do this.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.599
What are you gonna do, Colvin?
Throw me off the roof?

33:38.683 --> 33:39.642
The roof.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.645
-Let us through! Mikami's in trouble!

33:55.658 --> 33:57.076
I'll tell you something.

33:58.119 --> 34:02.206
You gotta change your attitude
because that is not how this works.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.504
I'm not a bad person.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.507
I got a wife, kids.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.761
I gave 28 years of my life
to the department.

34:14.844 --> 34:18.181
I deserve to take a little
for myself sometimes.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.932
You didn't have to kill him.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.976
Kill him? Why would I do that?

34:22.935 --> 34:24.437
You don't kill the golden goose.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.396
Colvin!

34:27.690 --> 34:28.733
You're done.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.527
Okay? You're beat.

34:32.111 --> 34:32.945
Fine!

34:33.529 --> 34:34.697
Take me in, then.

34:35.865 --> 34:38.826
I'm not the only cop
who's ever skimmed the collection plate.

34:39.577 --> 34:40.578
I'll take the IA hit.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.498
They'll let me retire quietly.

34:44.499 --> 34:47.418
The last thing they want
is a captain in the news.

34:48.461 --> 34:54.675
But you, five to ten, upstate,
for a bad shoot plus obstruction.

34:54.759 --> 34:55.760
And Mikami here?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.638
Guilt by association.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.057
Probably forced out.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.645
Unless we go downstairs

35:06.813 --> 35:08.481
like today never happened.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.441
You get your gun back.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.152
Hell, maybe even your gold shield.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.531
You know you won't get a better offer
from the DA.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.158
Yeah, you know what?
You're probably right.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.160
But I'll take my chances.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.663
You chose your side. I chose mine.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.164
-You chose wrong.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.382
I shouldn't even be
talking to you right now.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.805
<i>Didn't you give her</i>
<i>the warm milk with cinnamon?</i>

35:42.807 --> 35:45.309
She needs me. Let me talk to her.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.645
You don't get to make demands.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.315
You'll never be able to understand
the pain you've caused our family.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.109
Especially my dad.

35:53.192 --> 35:56.737
The only thing that I care about is
to help him reconnect with his daughter.

35:56.821 --> 35:57.780
<i>To heal.</i>

35:57.864 --> 35:59.782
Right, and I can help with that.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.286
There are things you don't know about her.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.915
She's scared of bubble baths.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.961
She loves to talk in funny voices.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.423
Always skips the letter R in the ABCs.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.302
She loves butterfly kisses.

36:20.636 --> 36:23.181
<i>Just please let me talk to her. I just…</i>

36:24.432 --> 36:27.185
I just wanna let her know she's okay,
that she's safe.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.396
Under one condition.

36:32.064 --> 36:33.232
<i>You have to tell her…</i>

36:35.193 --> 36:36.861
that her dad loves her.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.155
That he always has.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.074
That he's a good man.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.163
Okay. Put her on.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.420
Put him in Holding.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.225
Seems like you're always
where the action is.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.435
Stone was
a great detective back in the day.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.062
She's on our side.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.607
I do appreciate the assist.

37:15.191 --> 37:18.236
Speaking of sides,
I've taken lead on the compound case.

37:18.319 --> 37:22.156
We brought in everybody registered
to that address, and wouldn't you know it,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.158
they're all telling the same canned story.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.078
-You're free to go. For now.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.084
My God.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.797
I've listened to you
deny those hallucinations for months.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.049
There's no denying them now.

37:40.549 --> 37:41.884
Come on.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.135
What? You wanna stay?

37:43.219 --> 37:47.598
We can throw you in a cell too.
Ballistics will be back in an hour anyway.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.977
Go, I got this.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.666
No!

38:13.749 --> 38:15.543
-<i>Eden! Eden!</i>

38:16.168 --> 38:17.211
What have you done?

38:20.172 --> 38:21.632
Mommy.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.812
Guess by now you heard they took my gun.
We all know how this story ends.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.063
I have something for you--

38:36.147 --> 38:37.982
Vance, if you're here to sweat me,
don't bother.

38:38.065 --> 38:41.152
Okay, I'm not giving anyone up.
I'm gonna take the fall on this.

38:41.235 --> 38:44.780
I'm quite clear about your moral compass.
That's not why I'm here.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.117
Your ballistics report.

38:49.118 --> 38:52.038
-That report's not due for another hour.
-It's an advance copy.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.838
This says the casings and the bullets
match a Ruger.

39:03.549 --> 39:04.675
I have a Glock, Vance.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.096
Who you pinning this on?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.682
You're not taking one
for the team this time. No one is.

39:11.766 --> 39:15.311
This particular Ruger's
never even been manufactured.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.814
Erika's death will be the cold case
that just keeps getting colder.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.525
You see, the thing about a compass is,

39:21.609 --> 39:24.320
you have to adjust it
for your environment.

39:24.403 --> 39:28.324
That space between where you're going
and where the compass is pointing you is…

39:28.991 --> 39:30.534
It's the gray area.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.663
We're both headed
in the right direction, Jared.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.415
Roughly.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.433
How could you let her get to you?

39:57.311 --> 39:59.146
After everything, Cal, why?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.151
-Why?
-I just wanted to help.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.613
I thought maybe if Angelina told her
that you weren't bad,

40:07.696 --> 40:09.407
that she's safe with you, then--

40:09.490 --> 40:12.576
I don't want Angelina
anywhere near this family. Ever.

40:14.036 --> 40:15.704
-How do you not get that?
-I <i>do </i>get that!

40:15.788 --> 40:16.872
No, you don't!

40:17.957 --> 40:20.251
You're connected to her
in some way I can't understand.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.295
How can you say that? I'm not connected--

40:23.379 --> 40:24.213
You are!

40:25.089 --> 40:27.049
I don't understand how, but you are.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.136
And I don't know
if you're strong enough to keep her out.

40:32.471 --> 40:35.975
For two years, I've been trying
to get you to love me again.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.476
I love you more than anything,

40:37.560 --> 40:39.895
but I am trying
to protect my kid, damn it!

40:43.065 --> 40:44.567
I'm your kid too, Dad.

40:45.067 --> 40:45.943
Cal.

40:46.026 --> 40:48.362
Nah, I get it. Loud and clear.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.490
Cal!

40:57.413 --> 40:59.081
Um, hi. Uh…

40:59.707 --> 41:02.460
I know that you're probably asleep
or whatever, but, TJ,

41:02.543 --> 41:04.753
I think I just found something.

41:04.837 --> 41:09.091
Um, okay, remember when Saanvi
found sapphire at Eureka?

41:09.175 --> 41:11.427
I mean, it's like whenever
unexplainable phenomena,

41:11.510 --> 41:15.139
the ark piece, the tail fin,
my dad's glowing hand…

41:15.222 --> 41:18.225
It's like sapphire
was the fingerprint to a miracle.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.854
Well, I think that there's more to it.

41:21.937 --> 41:27.776
In history, sapphire has been referenced
in myths and legends and religion.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.153
And get this.

41:29.236 --> 41:33.032
Moses was standing on sapphire
when God gave him the Ten Commandments.

41:33.115 --> 41:36.118
The Oracle of Delphi used sapphire
to get her prophecies.

41:36.202 --> 41:39.872
It's like whenever humans have been
in communication with the divine,

41:39.955 --> 41:41.832
it was thanks to sapphire.

41:42.416 --> 41:46.420
If these prophets did it, maybe we…

41:46.504 --> 41:51.467
<i>you </i>all can use sapphire
to get limitless Callings,

41:51.550 --> 41:54.178
get back to the divine consciousness.

41:55.054 --> 41:58.516
I think this could be the way
that we save the Lifeboat.

42:01.101 --> 42:04.063
Anyway, I… I miss you.

42:04.563 --> 42:07.149
<i>You've reached the voice mailbox</i>
<i>of Michaela Stone. Leave a message.</i>

42:33.259 --> 42:34.885
Let's start from the beginning.

42:35.844 --> 42:40.182
May this holy ordinance cleanse the soul
and redeem you in his name.

42:40.724 --> 42:41.559
Amen.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.315
How do you know Eagan Tehrani?

43:04.957 --> 43:06.542
It's your lucky day.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.003
<i>Our </i>lucky day.

43:54.548 --> 43:58.260
<i>Oye!</i> Just in time.
Carmen's about to blow out the candles.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.596
I wouldn't miss it.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.265
I caught a case today, Pops.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.601
Homicide.

44:06.644 --> 44:10.773
It felt like being a detective again.
Even better, we took down a dirty cop.

44:10.856 --> 44:11.690
Hmm.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.651
Maybe we should get you a cake.

44:15.402 --> 44:18.822
Thing is, you know, as dirty as he was,

44:19.823 --> 44:21.575
I don't think he killed that guy.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.869
I think the killer's still out there.

45:40.654 --> 45:42.698
Cal. Cal, open your eyes.

45:43.198 --> 45:44.074
Hey.

45:47.911 --> 45:48.996
Cal! Cal! Hey!
