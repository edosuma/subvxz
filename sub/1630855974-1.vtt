* <i>MTV.</i> *

00:17.080 --> 00:18.360
Are you still here?

00:18.560 --> 00:19.870
You need to get going.

00:20.070 --> 00:23.070
I can't get going.
I told you I don't feel well.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.470
What's the matter now?

00:24.670 --> 00:26.240
Oh, nothing, I just had

00:26.440 --> 00:27.870
explosive fucking diarrhea
all night

00:28.070 --> 00:30.440
because you decided
to get us KFC for dinner.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.650
You have KFC all the time.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.080
Yeah, and I have
diarrhea all the time!

00:35.280 --> 00:38.650
You're not staying home all day
and playing <i>Baldur's Gate 3.</i>

00:38.850 --> 00:42.190
- Now let's go.
- Ugh!

00:42.390 --> 00:44.720
Have a good day at school,
sweetie.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.340
Fuck you, Mom!

00:49.180 --> 00:50.400
This is bullshit.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.630
How do you get your mom arrested
for child abuse?

00:52.830 --> 00:54.900
She wouldn't let you stay home
and play <i>Baldur's Gate 3,</i>

00:55.100 --> 00:56.240
huh, fat ass?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.470
Who you callin' fat,
you heathen bitch?

00:58.670 --> 01:00.610
Dude, you don't wanna
miss school today.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.810
Clyde said he's gonna fart
on Tammy Mullins during P.E.

01:04.010 --> 01:06.080
Tammy Mullins has
sweet fucking knockers.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.750
Dude, Kenny,
enough about Tammy's knockers!

01:08.950 --> 01:10.220
You sound like
a white male trying to

01:10.420 --> 01:11.950
re-establish the patriarchy.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.120
(screaming)

01:15.320 --> 01:16.490
Eric, it's okay.

01:16.690 --> 01:18.920
- It's okay.
- Mom! Mom!

01:19.120 --> 01:20.330
I had a dream that...

01:20.530 --> 01:22.330
I was replaced
by a diverse woman!

01:22.530 --> 01:23.760
Oh, not again.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.100
Yeah, only this time,
it wasn't just me.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.670
They were taking all my favorite
people and replacing them

01:28.870 --> 01:30.500
with diverse women complaining
about the patriarchy.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.340
Will you check
under the bed and make sure

01:32.540 --> 01:34.040
there's no Disney executives
under there?

01:34.240 --> 01:36.610
- I promise there's not.
- I'm scared, Mom!

01:36.810 --> 01:38.510
Will you please just look
and make sure Kathleen Kennedy

01:38.710 --> 01:40.000
isn't under my bed?

01:40.930 --> 01:43.520
Kathleen Kennedy
is not under your bed.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.880
Can you check the closet?

01:45.080 --> 01:46.450
Eric, enough.

01:46.650 --> 01:49.520
I've told you there's no such
thing as Disney executives

01:49.720 --> 01:51.560
who replace everyone you love
with diverse women

01:51.760 --> 01:53.360
who complain
about the patriarchy.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.840
Now be a big boy.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.530
It's-it's not real.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.770
It's... it's not real.

02:01.970 --> 02:03.950
* *

02:12.630 --> 02:15.860
(rooster crows)

02:17.570 --> 02:18.580
- Get up!
- (yells)

02:18.780 --> 02:20.420
Come on, Stan, get up.
Let's go.

02:20.620 --> 02:21.620
- What, Dad?
- Downstairs.

02:21.820 --> 02:23.610
Let's go.
I'm sick of this shit.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.790
Okay.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.660
It has come to my attention
lately that

02:29.860 --> 02:33.600
young people today
don't know how to do shit.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.570
You got your phones and your AI
and you kids haven't

02:36.770 --> 02:38.870
learned to be able
to actually do anything.

02:39.070 --> 02:40.640
So we're going
to take this morning to

02:40.840 --> 02:43.940
learn how to fix something.
You see this?

02:44.140 --> 02:47.080
See this?
The oven door isn't working.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.750
It's falling off the hinges.
So what do we do?

02:49.950 --> 02:51.070
Shelley?

02:52.070 --> 02:53.420
I don't know.

02:53.620 --> 02:54.690
It's very simple.

02:54.890 --> 02:56.390
You gotta
make the hinges tighter

02:56.590 --> 02:57.960
so the oven door's more secure.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.360
So what you do is...
you take out your phone

03:01.560 --> 03:04.030
and you call the handyman.

03:04.230 --> 03:05.860
(line ringing)

03:06.060 --> 03:07.130
<i>HANDYMAN (over phone): Hello?</i>

03:07.330 --> 03:08.830
Hello. It's Randy Marsh.

03:09.030 --> 03:12.610
My oven door is not working.
Please come fix it.

03:12.810 --> 03:15.820
Now we rest
until the handyman comes.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.980
(tool clicking)

03:22.180 --> 03:24.620
Are you following this
at all, guys?

03:24.820 --> 03:27.450
- Is this seeping in?
- Nope.

03:27.650 --> 03:30.320
No, it looks like
the screws are totally stripped.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.760
What does that mean?
What's wrong?

03:31.960 --> 03:33.690
Can't get 'er fixed right now,
I gotta get

03:33.890 --> 03:35.960
some different washers
at the Home Depot.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.400
Okay, do that.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.660
Can't do it right now,
I gotta get

03:38.860 --> 03:40.470
over to Stephen Stotch's house

03:40.670 --> 03:42.030
and install his closet shelves.

03:42.230 --> 03:45.140
Okay, see, kids,
this happens sometimes

03:45.340 --> 03:47.740
but handymen don't make a lot
of money, so here's what you do.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.210
Oh, okay, I will pay you
an extra 30 bucks

03:50.410 --> 03:51.940
if you fix my oven now.

03:52.140 --> 03:55.350
Yeah, sorry, but Stotch already
gave me an extra 50 bucks.

03:55.550 --> 03:58.020
I will pay you
an extra 55 bucks.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.290
Randy, did you fix
the oven door yet?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.260
I'm working on it!

04:02.460 --> 04:03.590
Look, please.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.190
Whatever you want.
I'll throw in a six-pack

04:05.390 --> 04:06.730
of beer and you can get drunk.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.790
I don't need your trivial
little perks anymore, Marsh.

04:08.990 --> 04:11.830
I got work comin'
out my ears. It's like...

04:12.030 --> 04:13.530
I don't know,
it's like nobody knows

04:13.730 --> 04:15.580
how to do shit anymore.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.300
You're--
You're just gonna leave?

04:18.500 --> 04:20.470
I'll pay a different handyman.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.770
Yeah, go for it, buddy,

04:21.970 --> 04:24.290
I got so much money
I don't care.

04:26.330 --> 04:28.060
What the hell is going on?

04:28.830 --> 04:32.350
All right, just try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

04:32.550 --> 04:36.760
(inhales) Now tell me exactly
what it is you're afraid of.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.760
I keep having the same dream.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.860
Everywhere I look,
people are being replaced.

04:42.060 --> 04:45.500
Okay. And who do you think
is going to have you replaced?

04:45.700 --> 04:47.900
Them. The puppet masters.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.470
The last time I had the dream,
I was, I was walking

04:50.670 --> 04:52.170
down the school hallway...

04:52.370 --> 04:54.740
* *

04:54.940 --> 04:57.040
<i>And then I see Butters,</i>
<i>and he's like...</i>

04:57.240 --> 04:58.280
(Cartman's voice):
Hey, Eric! You wanna see

04:58.480 --> 04:59.610
what my mom packed me for lunch?

04:59.810 --> 05:01.150
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>I start to notice</i>

05:01.350 --> 05:02.580
<i>that something's wrong.</i>
<i>Everyone I cared about</i>

05:02.780 --> 05:04.080
<i>has been</i>
<i>systematically replaced.</i>

05:04.280 --> 05:05.720
<i>And finally I want to scream</i>
<i>and I'm like...</i>

05:05.920 --> 05:07.590
Why are they replacing
every single character

05:07.790 --> 05:09.250
with someone who is diverse?

05:09.460 --> 05:10.760
<i>- But then Kenny's like...</i>
- (Cartman's voice): It's not

05:10.960 --> 05:12.260
our fault, it's 'cause of
Kathleen Kennedy.

05:12.460 --> 05:13.560
<i>But then Kathleen Kennedy's</i>
<i>just like...</i>

05:13.760 --> 05:14.960
Fuck it! Make it more lame.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.930
<i>CARTMAN:</i>
<i>And everyone in town is like,</i>

05:17.130 --> 05:18.800
<i>"No, please, Kathleen Kennedy,</i>
<i>stop ruining everything."</i>

05:19.000 --> 05:20.100
<i>But Kathleen Kennedy</i>
<i>is all like...</i>

05:20.300 --> 05:21.630
Put another gay diverse
woman in it.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.440
Make it more fucking lame.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.570
<i>And Disney stock just keeps</i>
<i>going down and down and down!</i>

05:25.770 --> 05:27.240
<i>And then Bob Iger is all like...</i>

05:27.440 --> 05:29.510
(Cartman's voice): No! No!
What's going on with my stocks?

05:29.710 --> 05:30.980
No, Kathleen Kennedy!

05:31.180 --> 05:33.300
(screaming)

05:34.130 --> 05:36.380
Oh. It happened again,
didn't it?

05:36.580 --> 05:39.620
Okay, Eric, I think I know
what's going on here.

05:39.820 --> 05:43.290
Your fears aren't about Disney
replacing everything you love.

05:43.490 --> 05:47.890
What everyone is afraid of these
days is being replaced by AI.

05:48.090 --> 05:49.430
- AI?
- But you don't need

05:49.630 --> 05:51.030
to worry, Eric.

05:51.230 --> 05:53.530
As long as you work hard
and stay in school,

05:53.730 --> 05:55.170
you can make something
of yourself.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.270
Become an elite worker like
I did that AI can't replace.

05:58.470 --> 05:59.870
You're a therapist
and the best thing

06:00.070 --> 06:01.170
you have to tell me is
"stay in school"?

06:01.370 --> 06:03.910
You're in control
of your future, Eric.

06:04.110 --> 06:05.810
You just need to ask yourself,

06:06.010 --> 06:07.180
"Who will be the people

06:07.380 --> 06:10.130
still making money
in the AI-driven future?"

06:11.000 --> 06:12.750
(electricity crackles)

06:12.950 --> 06:14.670
What the-- What the fuck?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.930
(tool clicking)

06:20.130 --> 06:21.490
Could you hurry it up, please?

06:21.690 --> 06:22.730
I kind of need to
get back to work.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.030
Yep, well, looks like

06:24.230 --> 06:25.800
you got a short
in the outlet there.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.400
I'd have to get a new outlet
at Home Depot.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.370
I can probably come
change it on the 28th.

06:30.570 --> 06:32.340
28th? No, no, no, look.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.640
I'll give a hundred bucks
to get this done today.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.940
I already got a feller
giving me thousands

06:37.140 --> 06:38.880
to fix his toilet
this afternoon.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.450
Thousands?
I can't afford that.

06:41.650 --> 06:42.950
Free therapy sessions.

06:43.150 --> 06:45.320
How about we trade?
You do the handiwork for me.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.650
And I'll give you five
free therapy sessions!

06:47.850 --> 06:49.190
Oh, no, thanks.

06:49.390 --> 06:53.910
I do all my therapy
on the AI Freudbot app.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.070
<i>ANNOUNCER: This is</i>
South Park Breaking News.

07:00.270 --> 07:02.230
Shocking developments
in the country today,

07:02.430 --> 07:05.300
it appears that nobody
knows how to do shit anymore.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.010
Our own Chris Martins
is live on the scene.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.680
Tom, I'm standing in
my bathroom where the new

07:10.880 --> 07:13.380
tile for my shower
has yet to be installed.

07:13.580 --> 07:16.480
As you can see, the tile has
started to peel off in places.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.050
Now the handyman was supposed
to come days ago to fix it

07:20.250 --> 07:21.490
but he claims to have
better offers

07:21.690 --> 07:23.090
from other white-collar workers

07:23.290 --> 07:26.360
like me whose practical
know-how has atrophied.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.560
It appears
we've all screwed ourselves

07:28.760 --> 07:31.910
by relying on technology and AI.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.840
- (phone chimes)
- Hey, Siri,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.570
how do you fix
a broken oven door?

07:40.770 --> 07:43.610
<i>SIRI: Here's what I found</i>
<i>from reference.com.</i>

07:43.810 --> 07:46.880
<i>Undo any screws that</i>
<i>hold the hinges in position,</i>

07:47.080 --> 07:49.010
<i>pull the door upward</i>
<i>and then outwards</i>

07:49.210 --> 07:51.080
<i>to detach hinges from the oven.</i>

07:51.280 --> 07:53.120
<i>Insert the new hinge</i>
<i>into the hinge holes</i>

07:53.320 --> 07:55.990
<i>and secure the hinges</i>
<i>with screws.</i>

07:56.190 --> 08:00.330
Hey, Siri, okay,
can you do that for me?

08:00.530 --> 08:02.130
<i>Can I do what for you?</i>

08:02.330 --> 08:04.430
Can you fix my oven door for me?

08:04.630 --> 08:06.160
It's broken.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.970
<i>I cannot do that</i>
<i>because I do not have arms.</i>

08:10.170 --> 08:12.100
<i>You will need</i>
<i>to call a handyman.</i>

08:12.300 --> 08:14.540
The handyman isn't available.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.210
He's all, like, rich now

08:16.410 --> 08:19.140
and I fucking rely on him to
keep everything working here!

08:19.340 --> 08:21.910
<i>I am unable to fix an oven door.</i>

08:22.110 --> 08:25.420
Oh, well, hey, Siri,
I thought AI was supposed to be

08:25.620 --> 08:29.120
this amazing scary advancement
that could, like, do anything.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.020
Hey, Randy,
the oven door in the kitchen

08:31.220 --> 08:33.010
- still isn't--
- I am working on it!

08:33.840 --> 08:36.390
Hey, Siri,
all the handymen are rich

08:36.600 --> 08:39.900
and I can't afford them anymore
so what do I do?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.400
<i>Perhaps you could find</i>
<i>an unlicensed worker</i>

08:42.600 --> 08:45.340
<i>who does small day jobs</i>
<i>for cash.</i>

08:45.540 --> 08:47.840

08:48.040 --> 08:49.810
down at Home Depot?

08:50.010 --> 08:51.880
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said it that way.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.050
Hey, Siri, you mean like those

08:54.250 --> 08:56.650
broke-ass illegal immigrants
down at Home Depot?

08:56.850 --> 08:59.590
<i>Yes. There are often</i>
<i>people sitting out front</i>

<i>of Home Depot</i>
<i>waiting to be hired for work.</i>

09:02.860 --> 09:05.310
Yeah. Those guys!

09:06.140 --> 09:08.280
(school bell rings)

09:10.380 --> 09:11.930
Hey, Kenny, can we talk to you?

09:12.130 --> 09:13.400
Sure, guys, what's up?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.530
Well, Clyde says that you
told Tammy Mullins

09:15.730 --> 09:18.000
he was gonna fart on her in P.E.
so she didn't show up.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.040
Yeah, I might have told her.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.710
Well, Kenny, everyone was really
looking forward to that.

09:21.910 --> 09:23.040
Why did you ruin it?

09:23.240 --> 09:24.610
I told you guys
I think Tammy Mullins

09:24.810 --> 09:27.510
- has sweet fucking knockers.
- CARTMAN: You guys!

09:27.710 --> 09:30.680
You guys! Something super crazy
is happening, you guys.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.080
You went on a diet?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.720
This is serious, Kyle!

09:33.920 --> 09:35.220
At first they were just dreams,

09:35.420 --> 09:37.460
but now I feel like
I'm actually changing.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.160
Why would I be having visions
that I'm a diverse woman?

09:40.360 --> 09:42.160
Because you're a fat,
racist piece of shit.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.560
Goddamn it, I'm not fat.
I'm just shamed for my body

09:44.760 --> 09:46.330
in a world where white men
decide what's beautiful.

09:46.530 --> 09:48.700
(gasps)
What the fuck was that?!

09:48.900 --> 09:51.770
Why would I say that?
I don't say that. You see?!

09:51.970 --> 09:54.170
This is happening
to all of us, you guys.

09:54.370 --> 09:55.940
You might think
everything is okay.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.710
But Disney... is gonna get ya.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.480
Kathleen Kennedy's
gonna get ya.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.320
Disney and Kathleen Kennedy
are gonna get ya!

10:03.520 --> 10:05.120
(screaming)

10:05.320 --> 10:07.790
I don't think that what
I'm experiencing are dreams.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.760
I think that what
I'm seeing are windows...

10:09.960 --> 10:11.920
into alternate universes.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.540
Yeah, okay, I'm out.

10:14.310 --> 10:15.490
It's true, Kyle, there could be

10:15.690 --> 10:17.230
other universes
with other versions of--

10:17.430 --> 10:19.030
Everyone's sick of
the stupid multiverse, Cartman.

10:19.230 --> 10:21.100
It's not stupid,
it's totally possible

10:21.300 --> 10:22.700
and if you can't--

10:22.900 --> 10:24.300
(muffled): Kyle? Kyle?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.340
I swear, the multiverse is
just an excuse for lazy writing.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.410
- Whoa. Kyle!
- Yeah, it's like
every damn movie now.

10:28.610 --> 10:29.710
Kyle, what is this?

10:29.910 --> 10:31.810
Uh, you might
wanna listen to him, Kyle!

10:32.010 --> 10:33.580
Kyle, you gotta help me!

10:33.780 --> 10:34.650
Help me, Kyle!

10:34.850 --> 10:36.630
(screaming)

10:51.250 --> 10:53.030
(whistles) Hey!

10:53.230 --> 10:54.430
Hey, I need a worker!

10:54.630 --> 10:56.430
- Is that a handyman?
- There's one!

10:56.630 --> 10:57.940
- (all clamoring)
- Hey, you wanna trade?

10:58.140 --> 10:59.300
What the fuck?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.270
Randy! You know how
to do stuff, right?

11:01.470 --> 11:02.540
I gotta get the radiant heat

11:02.740 --> 11:04.040
installed in my house
and I'm offering

11:04.240 --> 11:05.880
free legal advice in exchange.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.480
You need a reporter?

11:07.680 --> 11:09.920
I'll report the news to you
if you fix my shower tile!

11:10.120 --> 11:12.280
How about a computer programmer?
I can do coding!

11:12.480 --> 11:14.020
Insurance broker?
Insurance broker?

11:14.220 --> 11:15.650
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

11:15.850 --> 11:17.990
We're trying to get
a handyman to do stuff for us.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.130
You know how to
install radiant heat or not?

11:20.330 --> 11:23.760
No, I need some broke-ass
immigrants to fix my oven door.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.230
- (all groaning)
- Dang it.

11:25.430 --> 11:27.580
Hey! Here comes
a different handyman!

11:28.850 --> 11:32.670
(whistles) Hey, anyone wanna
make a bunch of money?

11:32.870 --> 11:35.790
I need four workers who know
how to use a power saw.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.380
I'll do lawyer work if
you install my radiant heat!

11:39.580 --> 11:41.210
I've got skills
in human resources.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.610
Let's work something out!

11:42.820 --> 11:46.230
No, I need guys that know
how to work a power saw.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.610
None of you know how to
work a power saw? Jesus Christ.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.540
What universe is this?

12:06.590 --> 12:09.210
Yo, Kenny, we gotta
ask you something.

12:09.410 --> 12:12.080
Are you, like,
in love with Tammy Mullins?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.680
I'm not in love with her,
I just like her knockers.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.150
Okay, well, why would you
protect someone from getting

12:17.350 --> 12:19.850
farted on unless there
were some real feelings there?

12:20.050 --> 12:22.050
Dude, I said I was sorry, okay?

12:22.250 --> 12:23.590
You guys! You guys!

12:23.790 --> 12:26.620
Something really weird
is going on!

12:26.830 --> 12:29.490
I keep having the same dream
that I'm a fat little white boy.

12:29.690 --> 12:32.230
You ain't white,
but you definitely fat.

12:32.430 --> 12:33.800
This is serious, Kyle!

12:34.000 --> 12:37.040
It's more than a dream,
it's becoming like real now!

12:37.240 --> 12:38.540
I keep seeing all of you!

12:38.740 --> 12:40.610
Being replaced by
little white motherfuckers!

12:40.810 --> 12:43.280
Well, maybe you should try
not being so racist, Cartman.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.510
You can't be racist
towards white people, Stan!

12:45.710 --> 12:48.750
They all honky-ass bitches!
You know what this is?

12:48.950 --> 12:51.800
I think this is some
alternate universe shit.

12:52.630 --> 12:54.620
Yeah, right, you just
acting crazy 'cause you wanna

12:54.820 --> 12:57.420
- get sent home from school.
- No, I'm not, Kyle!

12:57.620 --> 12:59.220
Yeah, bitch, you just
wanna get sent home

12:59.420 --> 13:01.430
so you can play <i>Baldur's Gate 3.</i>

13:01.630 --> 13:04.410
(yelling)

13:05.550 --> 13:07.550
(yelling)

13:09.320 --> 13:11.640
What the fuck?

13:11.840 --> 13:13.540
Oh, my God, it's all real!

13:13.740 --> 13:16.610
Whatever you're doing,
Cartman, we ain't buyin' it.

13:16.810 --> 13:19.440
Stay away from me! You aren't
my friends! Do you understand?

13:19.640 --> 13:21.910
Is that supposed to be Cartman?

13:22.110 --> 13:23.620
It ain't Cartman
but it's still fat.

13:23.820 --> 13:25.480
Just more like
little round and fat.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.520
Yeah, like Tammy Mullins'
knockers.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.820
Kenny! Brah.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.990
Chill with the knockers. Man!

13:31.190 --> 13:33.330
No...

13:33.530 --> 13:35.740
No...!

13:36.980 --> 13:39.360
(school bell rings)

13:39.560 --> 13:41.500
Okay, so Clyde says he
can probably try to fart

13:41.700 --> 13:43.270
on Tammy Mullins again
during fourth period.

13:43.470 --> 13:45.200
But this time Kenny
has to keep his mouth shut.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.410
It's fine!
I won't say anything, fine!

13:47.610 --> 13:49.570
He's gonna say something,
he's totally in love with her.

13:49.770 --> 13:52.640
- No, I'm not!
- You guys! You guys!

13:52.840 --> 13:54.810
Holy shit, you guys,
I fuckin' told you!

13:55.010 --> 13:57.600
I fuckin' told you this
was happening, didn't I?

13:58.570 --> 13:59.650
Told us what was happening?

13:59.850 --> 14:01.350
I told you I was having
all these dreams

14:01.550 --> 14:02.890
that I was a fat
little white boy

14:03.090 --> 14:04.860
and you guys were all
white boys too and now look!

14:05.060 --> 14:06.640
Y'all actually turned into 'em!

14:07.440 --> 14:09.690
- Do we know you?
- I'm Cartman.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.600
And you're Kyle and you're Stan
and you're fucking Kenny.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.430
Only it's a parallel,
alternated universe

14:14.630 --> 14:15.870
and y'all have been replaced.

14:16.070 --> 14:18.000
Uh, okay, cool lady.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.770
We gotta get to class.

14:19.970 --> 14:21.410
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

14:21.610 --> 14:23.140
You guys are gonna
listen to me this time!

14:23.340 --> 14:25.110
I need help!

14:25.310 --> 14:27.050
Cartman's just messing with us.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.280
Fuck you, Kyle!

14:28.480 --> 14:29.810
This is serious,
you fuckin' butt-fucker!

14:30.020 --> 14:32.680
Yeah, listen, lady,
we really gotta get going.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.890
Will you guys fucking
listen to me?! I'm Cartman!

14:36.090 --> 14:38.920
You're not Cartman and
multiple universes are stupid.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.480
Oh, goddamn it!

14:43.410 --> 14:45.660
Tom, I'm still here
live at the scene.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.370
Dozens of white-collar workers
are gathered hoping

14:48.570 --> 14:51.170
to get the attention of
just one handyman.

14:51.370 --> 14:53.740
It's a scene
of desperation and a reminder

14:53.940 --> 14:56.660
of where our
country's economy is headed.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.660
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- (all clamoring)

15:04.000 --> 15:06.450
Hey, hey! Excuse me,
you're a handyman, right?

15:06.650 --> 15:08.990
Can I get you to come look
at my oven door?

15:09.190 --> 15:10.620
I can trade you services.

15:10.820 --> 15:14.030
I have geology skills.
Could you come fix my door

15:14.230 --> 15:15.760
and I'll give you some geology?

15:15.960 --> 15:18.860
Hey, why don't you guys
get outta here?

15:19.060 --> 15:22.220
You're making the Home Depot
look all shitty.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.040
Fuckin' rich assholes.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.740
- (all grumbling)
- Ugh, sucks.

15:27.940 --> 15:28.910
Aw, man.

15:29.110 --> 15:31.340
Boy, I wish
I knew how to fix stuff.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.540
I'd be rich, too.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.810
I could know how to fix stuff!

15:35.010 --> 15:36.810
The problem is
when I could have been learning

15:37.020 --> 15:40.090
how to fix stuff, I went
to fucking college instead!

15:40.290 --> 15:41.520
Hey, yeah, he's right.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.220
We all went to college,
and where did it get us?

15:44.420 --> 15:46.620
Yeah, I'm still paying off
my college loans.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.630
Yeah, so am I! Now I don't
know how to do anything

15:49.830 --> 15:52.400
'cause I got suckered into going
to college and learning stupid

15:52.600 --> 15:55.470
geology that anyone can know
'cause of goddamn AI!

15:55.670 --> 15:56.770
Yeah, fuck college!

15:56.970 --> 15:58.440
Let's go
get our fucking money back!

15:58.640 --> 16:00.740
- OTHERS: Yeah!
- Yeah! Fuck college!

16:00.940 --> 16:02.760
- Come on, let's go!
- (all clamoring)

16:04.130 --> 16:06.310
(clamoring continues)

16:06.510 --> 16:08.750
- Stupid college!
- You wasted our time!

16:08.950 --> 16:11.980
- Fuck you, college!
- Piece of shit college!

16:12.180 --> 16:13.490
Hey-hey, college!

16:13.690 --> 16:15.920
You know what you are?!
You're a scam!

16:16.120 --> 16:17.190
College is a scam!

16:17.390 --> 16:19.190
- (cheering)
- OTHERS: Yeah!

16:19.390 --> 16:20.460
Yeah, that's right!

16:20.660 --> 16:21.590
Yeah, hey, college!

16:21.790 --> 16:23.230
Here's my student loan bill.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.160
That I'm still paying off!

16:25.360 --> 16:27.680
Well, guess what,
I'm not paying it!

16:28.450 --> 16:30.500
- Yeah!
- We don't owe you nothing!

16:30.700 --> 16:32.370
- (all clamoring)
- RANDY: Guess what, college?!

16:32.570 --> 16:35.840
We don't owe you money,
you owe us money!

16:36.040 --> 16:37.140
OTHERS:
Yeah!

16:37.340 --> 16:40.260
Yeah, that's right!

16:41.100 --> 16:43.080
You think you can
just sit there and not even

16:43.280 --> 16:45.750
respond to us, college?
Okay!

16:45.950 --> 16:48.490
You aren't going to destroy
any more lives!

16:48.690 --> 16:50.220
All right, bring in
the catapult.

16:50.420 --> 16:51.860
Bring in the catapult!

16:52.060 --> 16:52.920
OTHERS:
Yeah!

16:53.130 --> 16:54.290
Yeah, that's right!

16:54.490 --> 16:56.710
(grunting)

16:59.650 --> 17:02.850
- What's that?
- That's the catapult.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.740
Well, but it's still in the box.

17:05.940 --> 17:08.240
Yeah, somebody's
gotta put it together.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.110
Well, how are we gonna...

17:10.310 --> 17:11.510
Hang on, college!

17:11.710 --> 17:12.810
How're we gonna
break the college if

17:13.010 --> 17:14.450
the catapult is still
in the box?

17:14.650 --> 17:16.080
It's okay,
we called the handyman.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.330
He's gonna build it for us.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.990
Hello, gentlemen, what
seems to be the problem?

17:27.190 --> 17:28.660
Oh! Oh!

17:28.860 --> 17:30.460
You said
you couldn't work today.

17:30.660 --> 17:32.400
You're supposed
to fix my oven door!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.170
I've got a lot of jobs there,
buddy.

17:34.370 --> 17:35.570
This one paid the most today.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.100
We all pooled together
and offered him $20,000.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.770
$20,000?

17:39.970 --> 17:41.440
What the fuck
are you guys doing?!

17:41.640 --> 17:43.990
You're gonna make him
totally impossible now!

17:44.960 --> 17:46.240
(phone beeps)

17:46.440 --> 17:48.650
All right, send Broflovski,
Marsh and McKormick

17:48.850 --> 17:50.830
into my office, please.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.120
Aw, what the hell?

17:53.320 --> 17:54.650
Sit down, boys.
One of our students here

17:54.850 --> 17:56.150
says you've been
treating them unfairly.

17:56.350 --> 17:59.160
- Treating who unfairly?
- We didn't do anything!

17:59.360 --> 18:00.790
We're just minding
our own business

18:00.990 --> 18:02.610
and she keeps saying
she's Eric Cartman!

18:03.650 --> 18:05.750
Okay. And what's
wrong with that?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.800
What's wrong is it
doesn't make any sense.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.400
Okay, I see.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.070
There's a diverse female
where Cartman used to be

18:13.270 --> 18:14.370
and you don't like that.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.470
It's not that we
don't like it, it's...

18:16.670 --> 18:17.780
don't you think that's weird?

18:17.980 --> 18:19.580
I don't see
a problem with it at all.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.380
And if you boys don't think
Eric can be a Black woman,

18:21.580 --> 18:23.600
then maybe the problem is you.

18:24.870 --> 18:25.750
What?

18:25.950 --> 18:27.020
You think it's perfectly normal

18:27.220 --> 18:28.790
that Cartman
is suddenly a Black woman?

18:28.990 --> 18:30.220
You probably don't like
that Indiana Jones got replaced

18:30.420 --> 18:31.860
by a female either, huh?

18:32.060 --> 18:34.030
You probably have a problem
with Black Spider-Man, too.

18:34.230 --> 18:35.730
No! Miles Morales is sweet.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.030
That's a whole constructed thing

18:37.230 --> 18:38.630
with its own character
and narrative!

18:38.830 --> 18:41.730
This is just taking Cartman,
same old Cartman,

18:41.930 --> 18:43.640
and putting a Black woman in it.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.770
Well, you know what I think
about that, Kyle?

18:45.970 --> 18:47.040
Hold on. Hold on.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.510
- (farts)
- (laughs)

18:48.710 --> 18:50.140
That's what I think
about that, Kyle! (laughs)

18:50.340 --> 18:51.480
Goddamn it, Cartman!

18:51.680 --> 18:53.180
Dude, what the fuck
is going on?!

18:53.380 --> 18:54.910
I'll tell you what's going on.

18:55.110 --> 18:56.780
You boys feel that your white
culture is being threatened

18:56.980 --> 18:58.580
and so you're
lashing out with racism.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.450
And if you
say anything more about

19:00.650 --> 19:02.150
a Black woman Cartman
not making any sense,

19:02.350 --> 19:04.160
then you can all just have
three weeks' detention!

19:04.360 --> 19:05.590
Now get out of my office!

19:05.790 --> 19:07.360
- Goddamn it!
- (laughs)

19:07.560 --> 19:09.230
Fuck you, Kyle.
You have to help me!

19:09.430 --> 19:11.300
How's that fart feeling
on your face right now?

19:11.500 --> 19:12.660
KYLE:
Shut up!

19:12.860 --> 19:15.850
CARTMAN: Na-na-na-na-na.
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.840
(overlapping chatter)

19:22.040 --> 19:25.080
(Cartman moaning)

19:25.280 --> 19:27.880
And we both told Clyde,
"Okay, you can try to fart

19:28.080 --> 19:29.850
on Tammy Mullins later.
Kenny won't tell her."

19:30.050 --> 19:32.680
And guess what? This little
motherfucker does it again!

19:32.880 --> 19:35.120
I'm sorry.
She hypnotized me.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.820
Everyone's trying
to enjoy themselves, dude.

19:37.020 --> 19:38.860
Why do you keep fucking it up?

19:39.060 --> 19:40.660
Hey, who's the fat
little white boy?

19:40.860 --> 19:42.760
Who knows?
White heterosexual males

19:42.960 --> 19:44.460
think they're welcome anywhere.

19:44.660 --> 19:47.400
- (moaning)
- (bell chimes)

19:47.600 --> 19:50.070
Okay, children,
let's take our seats.

19:50.270 --> 19:53.140
Today we're going to
talk more about female exclusion

19:53.340 --> 19:54.710
in the male patriarchy.

19:54.910 --> 19:56.510
(moaning)

19:56.710 --> 19:59.610
Uh, Butters,
who is that sitting next to you?

19:59.810 --> 20:00.850
Oh, I don't know, ma'am.

20:01.050 --> 20:03.050
I think it's
supposed to be Eric.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.650
I am Eric!

20:04.850 --> 20:06.880
All Cartman cares about
is playing <i>Baldur's Gate 3.</i>

20:07.080 --> 20:09.090
So the bitch did a switcheroo
with Spanky here.

20:09.290 --> 20:10.720
That is not what's going on!

20:10.920 --> 20:12.990
And I am not going to sit here
and be insulted anymore!

20:13.190 --> 20:14.730
I am a respected citizen
in my universe

20:14.930 --> 20:17.060
and I demand to speak to
someone with authority!

20:17.260 --> 20:20.720
- (radio static)
- Is there a problem here?

20:21.980 --> 20:24.820
No!

20:26.290 --> 20:28.490
(tool whirring)

20:29.620 --> 20:31.010
Eight years.

20:31.210 --> 20:34.010
Eight years I spent
wasting time at stupid college

20:34.210 --> 20:36.080
when I could have been
learning how to do stuff.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.480
All the time we spent
memorizing, studying-- for what?

20:39.680 --> 20:42.920
Anyone gets any info they want
with the touch of a button now.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.520
All right,
I think she's ready to go.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.630
- It's ready! It's ready!
- (all clamoring)

20:47.830 --> 20:50.560
Okay, okay, aim it
at the center of the school.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.060
How do we fire it?

20:52.260 --> 20:54.170
There's a big red button here.
Should I press it?

20:54.370 --> 20:56.050
Yeah, yeah, let 'er rip!

21:02.990 --> 21:04.810
- Yeah! Yeah!
- (all cheering)

21:05.010 --> 21:07.380
Yeah, take that, college!

21:07.580 --> 21:09.110
Let's see them ignore that!

21:09.310 --> 21:11.480
I can't wait
to see what they do now.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.590
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:13.790 --> 21:15.200
Hey-hey, wait, what's that?

21:20.740 --> 21:23.240
Hey! Hey, no,
you son of a bitch!

21:24.710 --> 21:27.130
GERALD:
He's just gonna fix the glass!

21:27.330 --> 21:28.600
Ugh!

21:28.800 --> 21:29.930
You fucking give these
billionaires your money

21:30.130 --> 21:31.470
and then another billionaire
just comes

21:31.670 --> 21:33.240
and profits off of that.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.690
Society is so fucked up!

21:42.530 --> 21:44.780
Something is
wrong with the universe.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.580
Our stocks are down
and every Disney movie

21:46.780 --> 21:48.250
this year has failed!

21:48.450 --> 21:49.890
We don't understand it, sir.

21:50.090 --> 21:52.160
We keep making
the same movie over and over

21:52.360 --> 21:55.290
and pandering to everyone
but suddenly it's not working.

21:55.490 --> 21:57.730
Then we've got to pander harder!

21:57.930 --> 22:00.100
Look, I don't want
to have to say it, but...

22:00.300 --> 22:03.150
I think the problem is
Kathleen Kennedy.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.310
Kathleen Kennedy has
made studios a lot of money.

22:07.510 --> 22:10.910
Yes, before. But you have
to admit something's changed.

22:11.110 --> 22:13.480
For weeks now she's been
completely different.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.980
- It's true.
- What if...

22:16.180 --> 22:18.970
this is a different
Kathleen Kennedy?

22:20.700 --> 22:21.750
What are you saying, Rick?

22:21.950 --> 22:23.760
I'm just saying
isn't it possible

22:23.960 --> 22:26.420
that we here
at Disney pandered so much...

22:26.620 --> 22:29.980
that we've opened a doorway
to the panderverse.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.430
The panderverse
is just a theory!

22:32.630 --> 22:35.530
And yet we do have
the panderstone downstairs.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.970
It's possible that someone
has tampered with it somehow.

22:39.170 --> 22:40.870
Well, she's on her way in
right now.

22:41.070 --> 22:43.040
If you wanna tell
Kathleen Kennedy you think

22:43.240 --> 22:44.710
she's from
an alternate universe,

22:44.910 --> 22:47.750
because we misused
the panderstone, go right ahead!

22:47.950 --> 22:51.030
(doors creak open)

22:56.770 --> 22:58.670
Is there a problem, people?

23:00.440 --> 23:01.930
No problem at all, Mrs. Kennedy.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.860
We were just discussing ideas

23:04.060 --> 23:05.730
of what to do with
the new Prince Eric movie.

23:05.930 --> 23:07.900
Put a chick in it, make her gay!

23:08.100 --> 23:12.400
Uh, yes, Mrs. Kennedy,
uh, some of the execs are just

23:12.600 --> 23:15.110
- expressing that maybe--
- Well, that maybe we should go

23:15.310 --> 23:17.580
a different route than we did
with Indiana Jones.

23:17.780 --> 23:18.940
Fuck Indiana Jones!

23:19.140 --> 23:21.200
Put a chick in it
and make her lame and gay!

23:23.160 --> 23:24.250
Sure. Yeah.

23:24.450 --> 23:27.200
Let's try that... again.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.890
* *

23:31.090 --> 23:33.270
(indistinct chatter)

23:34.310 --> 23:36.860
And then... and then there was,
like, this ball

23:37.060 --> 23:38.430
and then Eric floated up

23:38.630 --> 23:40.060
into this portal
and disappeared!

23:40.260 --> 23:41.700
I don't care
what you saw, Butters,

23:41.900 --> 23:42.930
there's gotta be
a better explanation

23:43.130 --> 23:44.840
than just the stupid multiverse.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.540
Some multiverse stuff is cool.

23:46.740 --> 23:48.210
Yeah, it can be cool for,
like, one movie.

23:48.410 --> 23:49.940
Now it's just this
cheap device that people use

23:50.140 --> 23:51.980
to breathe life
into tired franchises.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.200
What are you guys talking about?

23:55.460 --> 23:59.120
Uh, we were just talking about
how amazing this all is.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.750
Okay, I've been trying to think

24:00.950 --> 24:02.190
about what we should do,
you guys.

24:02.390 --> 24:03.890
I think I know
how to make everything right,

24:04.090 --> 24:05.620
but we're gonna need
a really powerful computer.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.060
Are you gonna eat
your brownie, Kenny?

24:07.260 --> 24:08.590
Yeah, I'm gonna eat my brownie!

24:08.790 --> 24:10.700
Okay, fine, so we'll take you
to the computer lab.

24:10.900 --> 24:11.960
No, no, no, no, for this,

24:12.160 --> 24:13.500
we gotta get
a really powerful system.

24:13.700 --> 24:16.070
Is Kyle's mom still a big
fat bitch in this universe?

24:16.270 --> 24:18.170
What? My mom's not a bitch.

24:18.370 --> 24:20.400
Well, I mean,
she is kind of bitchy.

24:20.610 --> 24:21.940
She's a big dumb bitch, huh?

24:22.140 --> 24:24.040
What does calling my mom a bitch
have to do with anything?

24:24.240 --> 24:26.340
Because we could fake
a letter from Kyle's mom

24:26.540 --> 24:28.410
giving Kyle permission
to use her credit card number

24:28.610 --> 24:30.880
to buy all the stuff
we need at Best Buy.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.850
I mean, PC Principal
did say we have to help him.

24:34.050 --> 24:36.020
Her. Them. It.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.960
That's the dumbest idea ever!

24:38.160 --> 24:40.260
I don't even know what
my mom's credit number is!

24:40.460 --> 24:41.690
8-7-1-5...

24:41.890 --> 24:42.960
3-2-7...

24:43.160 --> 24:43.760
4-9-2...

24:43.960 --> 24:45.260
2-1-0-0-7.

24:45.460 --> 24:46.850
I use it all the time.

24:50.050 --> 24:53.790
- (phones ringing)
- (keyboards clacking)

24:56.790 --> 24:58.960
All right. Full name?

24:59.890 --> 25:02.080
What is your name, sir?

25:02.280 --> 25:05.120
I told them already
my name is Eric Cartman.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.320
We know Eric Cartman, okay?

25:07.520 --> 25:10.120
Eric Cartman is in here
all the time getting in trouble.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.990
That's because I'm
from a different universe!

25:12.190 --> 25:13.460
How many times do I have
to tell you people?

25:13.660 --> 25:15.060
The Disney company tried to
use their platform

25:15.260 --> 25:17.760
to bring about social change
and I got fucked.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.800
Hey, Chief. Chief,
you gotta hear this one.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.630
What is it, Johnston?

25:22.830 --> 25:24.070
Aw, God.

25:24.270 --> 25:26.040
This little white boy
claims he's actually

25:26.240 --> 25:27.510
from a different universe.

25:27.710 --> 25:28.940
Is that so?

25:29.140 --> 25:30.310
All right, honkey,
what kind of narcotics

25:30.510 --> 25:33.110
are you on?
Did you do a cavity search?

25:33.310 --> 25:34.780
Have you even said what
you've arrested me for?

25:34.980 --> 25:37.210
I come from a place where this
is extremely inappropriate.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.750
- OFFICER: Chief! Hey, Chief!
- Yeah?

25:39.950 --> 25:41.850
There's some
crazy white lady downstairs

25:42.050 --> 25:43.960
freakin' out and saying
she needs to talk to you.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.290
More honkies?

25:45.490 --> 25:47.020
What is this,
a Taylor Swift concert?

25:47.220 --> 25:48.960
Tell the nice lady
I'll see her after I'm done

25:49.160 --> 25:50.800
with "Eric Cartman" here.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.260
Well, that's just it, Chief.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.670
She's sayin' she's
looking for an Eric Cartman.

25:54.870 --> 25:56.630
Says her name
is Kathleen Kennedy.

25:56.830 --> 25:59.600
Kathleen Kennedy?! No!

25:59.800 --> 26:01.470
She's gonna try to change me,
too! I'm the only one left!

26:01.670 --> 26:04.830
- Hey, get back here!
- She's gonna get me!

26:07.090 --> 26:09.650
- (clamoring)
- Tom, I'm standing outside

26:09.850 --> 26:12.980
the South Park Country Club
where protestors have gathered

26:13.180 --> 26:15.450
to point out
the unfairness in our economy.

26:15.650 --> 26:18.490
The White House says they're
doing all they can but it's been

26:18.690 --> 26:22.260
several days now and my bathroom
tile still is not installed.

26:22.460 --> 26:25.530
Yeah, that's right. You see,
the whole system is rigged.

26:25.730 --> 26:28.300
You've got people like us
who just need our stuff fixed,

26:28.500 --> 26:30.500
and meanwhile
there's these billionaires

26:30.700 --> 26:31.800
that have all the control!

26:32.000 --> 26:33.200
Did you know that if just

26:33.400 --> 26:34.810
one of these billionaires
spread their wealth,

26:35.010 --> 26:37.270
- (phone ringing)
- it would mean thousands
to every per--

26:37.470 --> 26:38.710
it would mean thousands
to every--

26:38.910 --> 26:40.140
Sorry, hang on, just a second.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.650
Yeah?

26:41.850 --> 26:43.920
Hey, Ran, the oven door still
isn't shutting right.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.880
Yeah, I'm working on it, Sharon!

26:46.080 --> 26:48.150
I'm actually
working on it right now!

26:48.350 --> 26:49.990
Hey, one of them's coming out!

26:50.190 --> 26:51.390
(all clamoring)

26:51.590 --> 26:53.190
Please, just glance
at my water pressure!

26:53.390 --> 26:55.730
Mr. Fix It, can you please
tell us why you haven't been

26:55.930 --> 26:57.360
responding to people's calls?

26:57.560 --> 27:00.260
Well, I've just been busy
with my various assets.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.000
You see, I've been trying
to acquire

27:02.200 --> 27:05.840
some social media platforms.
I just bought Instagram.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.170
What? The country needs
stuff fixed.

27:08.370 --> 27:11.010
Why the fuck are you out
buying Instagram?!

27:11.210 --> 27:12.530
(tires screech)

27:13.660 --> 27:16.950
Hey, did you just outbid me
to acquire Instagram?

27:17.150 --> 27:18.350
Yeah, I outbid you.

27:18.550 --> 27:21.050
I own Instagram now
and you don't!

27:21.250 --> 27:22.790
Oh, yeah?
Well, I just acquired

27:22.990 --> 27:24.890
the entire
Bloomberg media company!

27:25.090 --> 27:26.520
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can kick your ass.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.190
You wanna fight me MMA?

27:28.390 --> 27:30.290
Yeah, I'll fight you MMA,
let's do it.

27:30.490 --> 27:32.100
What the hell
are they doing now?

27:32.300 --> 27:33.670
I'm just gonna make a company

27:33.870 --> 27:35.270
and I'm gonna fly to space!

27:35.470 --> 27:37.530
I bet I can get to space
before you do!

27:37.740 --> 27:41.120
Gal! Fuck these guys!

27:45.560 --> 27:48.180
She has all the right things
in her purse.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.150
Her driver's license
says Kathleen Kennedy,

27:50.350 --> 27:52.250
she has Kathleen Kennedy
credit cards.

27:52.450 --> 27:54.950
This is definitely all the same
makeup Mrs. Kennedy uses.

27:55.150 --> 27:58.090
I mean, according to this,
she really is Kathleen Kennedy.

27:58.290 --> 28:00.830
Or Kathleen Kennedy
from another universe.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.590
That's enough! Please!

28:02.790 --> 28:04.930
We're not going to
waste our time chasing

28:05.130 --> 28:06.700
after wild scientific theories!

28:06.900 --> 28:07.930
Well, we have to do something.

28:08.130 --> 28:10.070
Kathleen Kennedy is down
on set right now

28:10.270 --> 28:11.970
ruining the new Bambi movie!

28:12.170 --> 28:14.410
Put a diverse woman in it,
make it lame!

28:14.610 --> 28:18.010
But Mrs. Kennedy,
Bam-Bambi's a baby deer.

28:18.210 --> 28:21.080
Fuck baby deer!
Put a chick in it, make her gay!

28:21.280 --> 28:23.350
You guys, you better
come take a look at this.

28:23.550 --> 28:26.450
I don't think we are dealing
with our Kathleen Kennedy.

28:26.650 --> 28:28.720
I took images of Mrs. Kennedy
and put them

28:28.920 --> 28:31.120
against images of her
from a few months ago.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.760
With AI we could detect
the smallest irregularities.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.580
Take a look.

28:43.350 --> 28:46.600
All right. What do we know
about the panderverse?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.010
I'm afraid we know...

28:48.210 --> 28:49.440
frighteningly little.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.210
The only thing we know for sure

28:52.410 --> 28:54.280
is that if a portal
were somehow opened

28:54.480 --> 28:55.650
with the panderstone,

28:55.850 --> 28:58.420
then both universes
eventually will collide,

28:58.620 --> 29:02.220
leading to a level of pandering
we can't even fathom.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.120
That we know for sure. Yes.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.320
IGER:
Then we have to get everyone

29:05.520 --> 29:07.260
back to the right universe.

29:07.460 --> 29:11.050
Before it's complete
pandermonium.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.510
Okay, Kenny,
switch on the power supply.

29:25.710 --> 29:28.110
Stan, make sure
we've got ethernet!

29:28.310 --> 29:29.650
- All good.
- All right,

29:29.850 --> 29:30.950
let's just hope this works.

29:31.150 --> 29:33.050
Oh, man, what the hell?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.520
Dude, Kyle, what is up
with your Internet speed?

29:35.720 --> 29:37.760
Go tell your parents to
upgrade your Internet speed.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.020
No!

29:39.220 --> 29:40.490
Kyle, I know
you're afraid of your mom

29:40.690 --> 29:42.760
'cause she's a fat bitch,
but we have to do this.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.260
Stop calling my mom a bitch!

29:44.460 --> 29:46.360
- (knocking)
- Kyle!

29:46.560 --> 29:48.230
I just got an alert
that someone used

29:48.430 --> 29:50.100
my credit card at Best Buy?!

29:50.300 --> 29:53.370
Oh, hello, Mrs. Broflovski.

29:53.570 --> 29:56.340
My goodness,
you're looking nice today.

29:56.540 --> 29:57.940
What?

29:58.140 --> 29:59.840
You know, credit card fraud

30:00.040 --> 30:01.450
is very serious,
Mrs. Broflovski.

30:01.650 --> 30:03.380
You should call your
Internet company right away

30:03.580 --> 30:06.050
and up your speed
and make sure you're protected.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.090
Really? Kyle, who is this?

30:09.290 --> 30:11.060
Oh, haven't you heard, Mom?

30:11.260 --> 30:12.920
We're in a multiverse
and this is

30:13.120 --> 30:14.510
supposed to be Eric Cartman.

30:15.310 --> 30:16.690
Oh, okay, I'm fine with that.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.030
I better go call
the Internet company.

30:19.230 --> 30:20.430
What do you mean
you're fine with that?

30:20.630 --> 30:23.100
I think all this stuff
is great, Kyle.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.200
And what "all stuff"
is that, exactly?

30:25.400 --> 30:27.070
Ha! It worked.

30:27.270 --> 30:28.970
She's gonna call
the Internet company.

30:29.170 --> 30:31.540
Your mom is such
a dumb bitch, Kyle!

30:31.740 --> 30:32.980
Shut up, Cartman!

30:33.180 --> 30:36.650
* <i>Loo, loo, loo,</i>
<i>I got some apples</i> *

30:36.850 --> 30:40.550
* <i>Loo, loo, loo,</i>
<i>you got some, too</i> *

30:40.750 --> 30:43.720
* <i>Loo, loo, loo, let's</i>
<i>make some applesauce...</i> *

30:43.920 --> 30:45.220
- Butters.
- (yells)

30:45.420 --> 30:46.660
Butters! Butters, listen to me.

30:46.860 --> 30:49.260
- It's me, Eric.
- You-You-You're not Eric!

30:49.460 --> 30:50.660
Yes, I am Eric Cartman, Butters.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.230
Kathleen Kennedy
is trying to get me.

30:52.430 --> 30:53.900
She won't stop until her
master plan is complete.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.930
I'm not supposed to have
anyone in my room, I'm grounded!

30:57.130 --> 30:59.340
Butters, Disney is going to
get me. They already got you!

30:59.540 --> 31:00.870
(gasps) They did?!

31:01.070 --> 31:02.370
We are in this together,
Butters.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.840
You have to
keep me safe until I can

31:04.040 --> 31:06.840
- figure out how we're gonna--
- (knocking)

31:07.040 --> 31:08.980
She's here!
Butters, don't let her get me.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.650
- (knocking)
- VOICE: Butters?!

31:11.850 --> 31:15.220
Butters! Why didn't you
answer this door?

31:15.420 --> 31:16.890
Oh. Hey, Dad.

31:17.090 --> 31:19.790
What are you doing up here?
And why do you look so scared?

31:19.990 --> 31:23.860
Oh, I'm not scared, I'm just,
uh, I'm just having fun.

31:24.060 --> 31:25.260
Well, no having fun.

31:25.460 --> 31:28.000
You are grounded.
Start being more miserable.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.300
- Dad?
- Yes, Butters?

31:30.500 --> 31:33.140
Uh, could you check
under my bed and make sure

31:33.340 --> 31:34.740
Kathleen Kennedy isn't there?

31:34.940 --> 31:37.270
Butters, what have I told you
about being more mature?

31:37.470 --> 31:39.410
I can assure you
Kathleen Kennedy

31:39.610 --> 31:41.630
is not under your bed!

31:43.800 --> 31:45.520
(muffled groaning)

31:45.720 --> 31:46.920
(both screaming)

31:47.120 --> 31:48.020
That's fucking Kathleen Kennedy!

31:48.220 --> 31:49.020
Right fucking there!

31:49.220 --> 31:50.440
(both screaming)

31:51.340 --> 31:53.120
You! Come here!

31:53.320 --> 31:54.990
No, no, no, no, no!

31:55.190 --> 31:57.390
(grunting)

31:57.590 --> 32:00.450
No, no! No, no, no!

32:09.820 --> 32:11.490
(sputters)

32:13.260 --> 32:14.550
Well, Shelley,

32:14.750 --> 32:16.680
we need to talk
about your future.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.850
You see, there's very few
people at the top these days.

32:20.050 --> 32:22.490
AI can do everything
better than we can,

32:22.690 --> 32:25.470
except for stuff
that requires arms.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.230
I don't want you to
end up a deadbeat loser

32:29.430 --> 32:30.930
who goes to college, Shelley.

32:31.130 --> 32:32.660
You need to stay out of school,

32:32.860 --> 32:35.570
and instead go out and be
taught real skills that will

32:35.770 --> 32:38.800
still be profitable
in this post-AI universe.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.910
So what you do is you take
out your phone and you call

32:43.110 --> 32:46.440
the handyman, and see if
those rich people will have

32:46.640 --> 32:49.700
any internships or training
programs available for you.

32:55.800 --> 32:56.850
(panel chirps)

32:57.050 --> 32:59.390
Handyman service,
how can I help you?

32:59.590 --> 33:01.090
<i>RANDY:</i>
<i>Yeah, hi, it's Randy Marsh.</i>

33:01.290 --> 33:03.690
<i>I was wondering if you</i>
<i>might have any internships</i>

33:03.890 --> 33:05.100
<i>available for my daughter--</i>

33:05.300 --> 33:06.530
Hey! What in tarnation?!

33:06.730 --> 33:09.300
I told you I'd beat you,
you son' bitch!

33:09.500 --> 33:12.500
You ain't beatin' me!
Turn up them thrusters!

33:12.700 --> 33:14.240
<i>My galactic cruiser's</i>
<i>bigger than yours!</i>

33:14.440 --> 33:15.570
H-Hello?

33:15.770 --> 33:16.770
<i>Get out my way,</i>
<i>you little pecker!</i>

33:16.970 --> 33:18.210
Hello? Never mind.

33:18.410 --> 33:21.430
The rich people are all just
fucking around in space.

33:22.830 --> 33:24.670
(rumbling)

33:25.570 --> 33:27.020
What the hell was that?

33:27.220 --> 33:30.120
I'm getting significantly strong
readings from the panderstone.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.990
Mr. Iger.
We may have a solution.

33:32.190 --> 33:34.860
If this Kathleen Kennedy here
is from somewhere else, then

33:35.060 --> 33:37.890
there has to be a match for her
somewhere in our universe.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.500
So what we can do

33:39.700 --> 33:42.630
is use an AI program that
can take every image ever put

33:42.830 --> 33:45.820
on the Internet to try
and find a match to our image.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.440

34:00.520 --> 34:02.650
The rest of you,
don't let Kathleen Kennedy

34:02.850 --> 34:04.020
find out what we're up to.

34:04.220 --> 34:06.620
It's okay, we're keeping
Mrs. Kennedy distracted.

34:06.820 --> 34:09.440
We've sent her away
to have lunch at Spago.

34:10.310 --> 34:12.450
(classical music playing)

34:13.680 --> 34:15.130
There you are, Mrs. Kennedy,

34:15.330 --> 34:16.830
the linguini and clam sauce.

34:17.030 --> 34:18.340
Uh, excuse me?

34:18.540 --> 34:20.070
I believe I asked you
to put a chick in this

34:20.270 --> 34:21.870
- and make her gay?
- Uh...

34:22.070 --> 34:24.410
Yes, the chef was a little
confused what you meant by that.

34:24.610 --> 34:27.310
It means put a chick
in the linguini

34:27.510 --> 34:29.860
and make her fucking gay!

34:30.700 --> 34:32.900
And I want it lame!

34:38.570 --> 34:39.790
(screaming)

34:39.990 --> 34:43.130
She's gonna get me!
She's gonna get me!

34:43.330 --> 34:44.610
(horn blaring)

34:46.510 --> 34:48.080
(screams)

34:49.520 --> 34:51.490
No, no, no, no, no!

34:54.760 --> 34:56.410
Hey, who's that, Ned?

34:56.610 --> 34:58.080
I'm not sure.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.860
No!

35:02.760 --> 35:04.720
There he is!
Get him!

35:04.920 --> 35:06.570
(screams)

35:12.310 --> 35:15.540
No. Oh, my God, please, no!

35:17.340 --> 35:19.260
No...!

35:19.460 --> 35:20.810
Which way did they go?

35:21.950 --> 35:22.670
(gasps)

35:22.870 --> 35:25.240
We have to work together.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.870
Fuck you, Kathleen Kennedy!
Stay away, you fuckin' bitch!

35:28.070 --> 35:31.460
I'm in the same situation
you are, Eric!

35:33.360 --> 35:36.250
I know you're in
the wrong universe.

35:36.450 --> 35:38.630
So am I.

35:45.570 --> 35:49.030
Well, there's no
other way to put it.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.710
They have us over a barrel.

35:51.480 --> 35:55.600
We give these billionaires
all our money, rely on them,

35:55.800 --> 35:58.290
and so they can do
whatever they want.

35:59.050 --> 36:02.740
Let's just face it, we're
never gonna get our stuff fixed.

36:02.940 --> 36:04.410
Yeah.

36:04.610 --> 36:08.810
And I guess it's
nobody's fault but our own.

36:09.010 --> 36:10.410
Excuse me?

36:10.610 --> 36:11.750
My name is Bob Iger

36:11.950 --> 36:13.350
from the Disney
entertainment company.

36:13.550 --> 36:15.750
We're looking
for an Eric Cartman.

36:15.950 --> 36:18.690
Our universe
has been manipulated with.

36:18.890 --> 36:21.110
Have you all
noticed anything strange?

36:23.710 --> 36:26.960
Yes. Yes, the world
is completely upside down!

36:27.160 --> 36:28.400
Nothing makes sense!

36:28.600 --> 36:30.100
It's because
there's some kind of

36:30.300 --> 36:31.640
disruption in the panderverse.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.370
We believe Kathleen Kennedy
has opened a portal.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.970
This is all
Kathleen Kennedy's fault?

36:37.170 --> 36:39.440
This is all Kathleen Kennedy's
fault!

36:39.640 --> 36:40.680
Who's Kathleen Kennedy?

36:40.880 --> 36:43.010
One of the top executives
at Disney.

36:43.210 --> 36:44.620
It's not us, you guys.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.780
I knew there was an explanation!

36:46.980 --> 36:48.720
We didn't waste our time
at college!

36:48.920 --> 36:51.090
We didn't get lazy
from technology!

36:51.290 --> 36:53.890
Everything is
Kathleen Kennedy's fault!

36:54.090 --> 36:56.810
(all cheering)

36:57.610 --> 37:00.850
Follow me.
I'll help you find Eric.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.970
Okay, okay,
everything is finally loaded.

37:04.170 --> 37:05.770
We got Internet
at full capacity.

37:05.970 --> 37:07.140
You guys ready
to see if this works?

37:07.340 --> 37:09.210
- BOTH: Yeah!
- All right, let's do this!

37:09.410 --> 37:10.910
Launching Steam now.

37:11.110 --> 37:12.040
Steam?

37:12.240 --> 37:13.540
Okay. I'm in Steam.

37:13.740 --> 37:14.810
Got the application ready to go.

37:15.010 --> 37:16.530
The title screen is launching!

37:18.730 --> 37:20.780
It's working.
It's working, you guys!

37:20.980 --> 37:22.220
It looks sweet
on this big monitor!

37:22.420 --> 37:24.690
Wait a minute.
You mean this entire time,

37:24.890 --> 37:26.520
all you've wanted to do
is play <i>Baldur's Gate 3?</i>

37:26.720 --> 37:28.230
Yeah. What'd you think
I was trying to do?

37:28.430 --> 37:30.130
We thought you were
trying to set up some elaborate

37:30.330 --> 37:31.760
system to get
back to your universe!

37:31.960 --> 37:33.930
I ain't no
quantum astro physicist.

37:34.130 --> 37:36.670
The fuck I know about
how the multiverse works?

37:36.870 --> 37:39.370
Wow. It really is Cartman.

37:39.570 --> 37:41.050
All right, that does it!

37:42.320 --> 37:43.710
Get out of my room!

37:43.910 --> 37:46.210
You have to be cool to me, Kyle.
PC Principal says so.

37:46.410 --> 37:49.380
I don't care! All this multiple
universe stuff is tired and lazy

37:49.580 --> 37:51.250
and we are not doing it anymore!

37:51.450 --> 37:52.850
Boys! Boys,

37:53.050 --> 37:54.590
we need to help Disney
put our universe back together.

37:54.790 --> 37:56.090
Where's Eric Cartman?

37:56.290 --> 37:57.820
Dad, this might be hard
to understand,

37:58.020 --> 37:59.420
but this is Eric Cartman.

37:59.620 --> 38:01.060
Oh, okay, great.
Come on, Eric,

38:01.260 --> 38:02.590
- we need to go.
- (Kyle groans)

38:02.790 --> 38:05.130
We have to hurry, Eric.

38:05.330 --> 38:06.900
No. No, wait.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.000
Something's wrong.
Oh, my God!

38:09.200 --> 38:11.270
- What is it?
- My save game.

38:11.470 --> 38:13.670
I'm already like 50 hours
into <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i>

38:13.870 --> 38:16.040
but it's saying that
I have to start a new game.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.710
Do save games not cross
between multiple universes?

38:18.910 --> 38:19.980
Save games
don't even cross between

38:20.180 --> 38:21.610
PCs and PS5s,
why would they cross

38:21.810 --> 38:23.060
between multiple universes?

38:24.060 --> 38:25.250
No...!

38:25.450 --> 38:26.920
Please, everyone.
We are running out of time!

38:27.120 --> 38:28.820
We have to close
the panderverse before

38:29.020 --> 38:30.590
everything we care about
is destroyed!

38:30.790 --> 38:31.760
So what do we have to do?

38:31.960 --> 38:33.060
We have to get everyone

38:33.260 --> 38:34.830
back to the proper place,
but to breach

38:35.030 --> 38:36.630
the panderverse,
we need to find a place

38:36.830 --> 38:39.080
with integrity
that has a broken door.

38:39.980 --> 38:43.430
A place with "integridy"
that has a broken door.

38:43.630 --> 38:46.120
I know where to go.

38:48.190 --> 38:50.570
So, yeah, so it's just basically
off the hinges.

38:50.770 --> 38:52.580
I'd fix it myself
but I've been really busy.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.040
Do you think it'll work?

38:54.240 --> 38:55.610
If we're to try to open
a panderverse portal,

38:55.810 --> 38:57.650
it's as good as any place,
I suppose.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.580
Okay, people,
we don't have much time.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.800
Bring in the panderstone.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.690
(bicycle bell dings)

39:05.890 --> 39:07.860
I'm not your enemy, Eric.

39:08.060 --> 39:10.130
For some reason
fate has put us together.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.700
What do you want from me,
Kathleen Kennedy?

39:12.900 --> 39:15.000
I've been stuck in
this universe for months.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.070
I want out of here
just as much as you do.

39:17.270 --> 39:20.100
Hello, welcome to City Woke,
can I take your order, please?

39:20.300 --> 39:21.270
Ugh.

39:21.470 --> 39:23.110
We're just having tea,
thank you.

39:23.310 --> 39:25.110
Okay, you just wanna tea
and talk about

39:25.310 --> 39:27.410
shitty male-dominated society,
that's fine.

39:27.610 --> 39:29.450
I don't get it,
this is exactly the kind of

39:29.650 --> 39:31.250
universe you wanted,
why would you want to leave?

39:31.450 --> 39:35.170
To stop her from undoing
the panderverse completely.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.590
I saw the panderstone
for the first time

39:40.790 --> 39:41.990
a few years ago.

39:42.190 --> 39:44.130
<i>Bob Iger took us</i>
<i>to the Disney archives</i>

39:44.330 --> 39:47.200
<i>and showed us an ancient</i>
<i>piece of artificial intelligence</i>

39:47.400 --> 39:50.030
<i>that could be used to make</i>
<i>the same movies over</i>

39:50.230 --> 39:53.920
<i>and over again while appealing</i>
<i>to absolutely everyone.</i>

39:55.060 --> 39:57.270
<i>The panderstone worked great,</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

39:57.470 --> 40:00.540
<i>But then came the hate mail.</i>
<i>Ugly letters from racists</i>

40:00.740 --> 40:02.680
<i>who couldn't stand</i>
<i>that some of the panderstone's</i>

40:02.880 --> 40:05.620
<i>rehashes had diverse</i>
<i>women characters in the lead.</i>

40:05.820 --> 40:09.250
<i>I decided I would show them.</i>
<i>I would start making movies</i>

40:09.450 --> 40:11.290
<i>to fight all</i>
<i>the bigotry in our society.</i>

40:11.490 --> 40:13.490
<i>But instead</i>
<i>of doing any real work,</i>

40:13.690 --> 40:18.860
<i>I turned to the panderstone.</i>
<i>It made things so much easier.</i>

40:19.060 --> 40:21.400
<i>Soon, I was using</i>
<i>the panderstone over</i>

40:21.600 --> 40:24.570
<i>and over again to try</i>
<i>and fight all the ugly feedback,</i>

40:24.770 --> 40:27.620
<i>which in turn was growing</i>
<i>stronger and stronger.</i>

40:28.390 --> 40:30.910
<i>But I was fighting</i>
<i>with the wrong tool.</i>

40:31.110 --> 40:32.710
<i>I used the panderstone</i>
<i>to the point</i>

40:32.910 --> 40:35.230
<i>- that it became unstable.</i>
- (whooshing)

40:36.060 --> 40:37.880
<i>It opened a portal</i>
<i>to multiple universes,</i>

40:38.080 --> 40:40.800
<i>and something came through.</i>

40:48.540 --> 40:51.760
At first we fought. I tried
to send it back to its universe.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.460
But it got the upper hand.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.100
It was able instead
to send me to this universe,

40:56.300 --> 40:58.920
out of its way so
it could thrive in ours.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.840
(sighs) That's actually
the best explanation

41:03.040 --> 41:06.280
I've heard as to why
Disney movies all suck now.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.430
(typing)

41:10.330 --> 41:11.780
All right, I've set
the panderstone

41:11.980 --> 41:13.520
into the compromised doorway.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.870
Activating the panderstone now.

41:17.270 --> 41:18.250
Whoa!

41:18.450 --> 41:19.920
Space-time portal
is manifesting!

41:20.120 --> 41:21.590
Panderverse
quantum fields are aligned!

41:21.790 --> 41:24.190
Yeah, that sounds like typical
multiverse gobbledygook.

41:24.390 --> 41:26.360
Will you stop ripping
on multiple universes, Kyle?

41:26.560 --> 41:28.160
I'm trying to get back
to <i>Baldur's Gate.</i>

41:28.360 --> 41:31.300
Now I warn you, Mr. Marsh,
once inside the panderverse,

41:31.500 --> 41:33.170
you will be falling
through different realities.

41:33.370 --> 41:35.310
Your mind will barely
be able to comprehend

41:35.510 --> 41:37.910
- what you are experiencing.
- SHARON: Randy?

41:38.110 --> 41:40.140
I think the oven door is
still having problems if you--

41:40.340 --> 41:43.130
I am working on it, Sharon!

41:44.600 --> 41:47.620
The portal is at full.
This might be our only shot!

41:47.820 --> 41:49.520
Good luck, Mr. Marsh!

41:49.720 --> 41:51.400
Whoa!

41:53.310 --> 41:54.560
(screaming)

41:54.760 --> 41:56.880
Hold on to the rope!

41:58.380 --> 42:00.500
Oh, whoa!

42:00.700 --> 42:02.400
Oh, my God.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.070
Whoa!

42:05.270 --> 42:07.570
Whoa.

42:07.770 --> 42:09.670
(grunting)

42:09.870 --> 42:12.510
Oh, God, it's so weird.

42:12.710 --> 42:14.510
Shorts, now I'm wearing shorts!

42:14.710 --> 42:16.650
(yelling)

42:16.850 --> 42:17.780
Can you imagine it?

42:17.980 --> 42:19.480
An infinite number of universes

42:19.680 --> 42:21.690
with infinite combinations of
pants and shirts.

42:21.890 --> 42:24.970
What do you think about
multiple universes now, boys?

42:26.210 --> 42:27.460
Yeah, they're pretty
fucking stupid.

42:27.660 --> 42:28.560
Yeah.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.090
I understand that maybe

42:30.290 --> 42:31.860
you were trying to
make a difference, Kathleen.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.830
But you have to admit
the last few movies

42:34.030 --> 42:35.570
you've shit out
have been real stinkers.

42:35.770 --> 42:37.030
All I ever wanted was to

42:37.230 --> 42:39.370
make great entertainment,
believe me.

42:39.570 --> 42:42.410
But as soon as you start getting
piles and piles of hate mail,

42:42.610 --> 42:45.010
endless messages
calling you the c-word,

42:45.210 --> 42:46.910
you can't think straight.

42:47.110 --> 42:49.680
Well, I'm sorry I wrote
all those letters.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.480
It probably was a bit much.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.790
No, I got like
10,000 letters a day.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.420
Mm, I was doing more like
12,000 to 13,000,

42:56.620 --> 42:58.870
especially after the new
<i>Indiana Jones</i> came out.

42:59.870 --> 43:02.830
Then it's you! You're the one
who caused all this!

43:03.030 --> 43:04.800
Fuck you! You're the one
who caused all this!

43:05.000 --> 43:06.730
I wouldn't have tried
to fight racism

43:06.930 --> 43:07.860
with the panderstone
if you hadn't

43:08.060 --> 43:09.200
written all those letters.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.500
I wouldn't have written
all those letters

43:10.700 --> 43:11.740
if you hadn't
tried to fight racism

43:11.940 --> 43:13.570
with a fucking panderstone.

43:13.770 --> 43:15.240
(whooshing)

43:15.440 --> 43:17.640
Mr. Marsh!
Can you hear us?

43:17.840 --> 43:18.910
RANDY:
Oh, wow!

43:19.110 --> 43:20.880
You should see
the pants I have on now!

43:21.080 --> 43:24.280
Whoa! Oh, now I have on,
like, suspenders.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.220
Like almost like overalls
but not quite!

43:27.420 --> 43:28.380
My God.

43:28.580 --> 43:30.620
Mr. Marsh!
Try and stay focused!

43:30.820 --> 43:33.320
You should be
seeing another portal soon!

43:33.520 --> 43:35.560
If our Kathleen Kennedy
got the other Eric Cartman

43:35.760 --> 43:37.060
to the right place.

43:37.260 --> 43:38.830
RANDY:
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

43:39.030 --> 43:40.330
Dad? What's the matter?

43:40.530 --> 43:42.630
I'm wearing a Baltimore Ravens
shirt now!

43:42.830 --> 43:44.230
I hate the Ravens!

43:44.430 --> 43:47.000
I don't know if I can do this!

43:47.200 --> 43:49.140
Oh, now it's the Dolphins!
Ah! The Chiefs!

43:49.340 --> 43:50.940
Oh, it's the Chiefs!

43:51.140 --> 43:52.510
He's losing his mind!

43:52.710 --> 43:54.380
The panderverse
is filled with mystery

43:54.580 --> 43:57.950
and paradox, you--
you have to try and hang on!

43:58.150 --> 44:00.000
(rumbling)

44:01.200 --> 44:03.400
Jesus, it's getting worse.

44:09.310 --> 44:12.780
Where the fuck is Bob Iger?

44:13.580 --> 44:15.630
Uh, Mr. Iger
just had to take some

44:15.830 --> 44:17.370
of the others to a screening.

44:17.570 --> 44:20.400
I think that things
are being kept from me.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.910
And if you're going
to keep things from me,

44:23.110 --> 44:25.480
then you'd better
put a chick in it,

44:25.680 --> 44:28.810
and make her
fucking gay as fuck.

44:29.010 --> 44:31.030
(rumbling)

44:35.170 --> 44:37.920
So that's it,
that's the connection.

44:38.120 --> 44:40.860
I reacted to you
and you reacted to me.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.490
And I guess
we created each other.

44:43.690 --> 44:44.900
Mrs. Kennedy,

44:45.100 --> 44:46.100
I don't think
I've ever said this

44:46.300 --> 44:49.100
before in my life but...
I'm sorry.

44:49.300 --> 44:52.100
I lashed out so hard and used
the c-word so many times,

44:52.300 --> 44:54.500
you didn't really have
a choice but to double down.

44:54.700 --> 44:57.970
Eric, I know you care
about all things Disney.

44:58.170 --> 45:01.580
I'm sorry I was so reckless
with the things that you love.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.610
It was just lazy.

45:04.820 --> 45:06.280
I guess just wailing

45:06.480 --> 45:09.970
on woke stuff all the time
is pretty lazy, too.

45:17.140 --> 45:21.510
I think...
I think I can let go now.

45:28.450 --> 45:31.760
Aah...

45:32.560 --> 45:37.600
Come on, Kate. Looks like
we got a flight to catch.

45:44.400 --> 45:47.160
(electricity crackles)

45:47.360 --> 45:49.560
Whoa, what the hell is that?

45:49.760 --> 45:51.530
(screaming)

45:51.730 --> 45:53.130
(others gasp)

45:53.330 --> 45:56.070
Oh, yo, bitch!
You killed Kenny!

45:56.270 --> 45:58.280
You fat ho!

46:00.150 --> 46:02.160
(electricity crackles)

46:03.990 --> 46:05.560
(tires screech)

46:07.860 --> 46:09.100
Look!

46:12.730 --> 46:14.570
I'm back, you guys!

46:16.400 --> 46:18.390
Kyle! Kyle, I'm back!

46:18.590 --> 46:20.060
I was so wrong
about Kathleen Kennedy,

46:20.260 --> 46:21.660
Kyle, she's so awesome!

46:21.860 --> 46:23.930
Okay, what Cartman is this?

46:24.130 --> 46:25.330
Mrs. Kennedy, you're back!

46:25.530 --> 46:27.730
- Great to see you, ma'am.
- Thanks, you guys.

46:27.930 --> 46:30.530
We have a lot of changes
to discuss at the company.

46:30.730 --> 46:32.940
From now on we're only
going to make original content

46:33.140 --> 46:34.570
that doesn't pander.

46:34.770 --> 46:36.670
Sure we will, Kate.
Sure we will.

46:36.870 --> 46:37.940
(chuckles)

46:38.140 --> 46:40.030
RANDY:
Hey, guys! Guys, over here!

46:40.790 --> 46:44.050
I did a little extra work while
I was out in multiple universes.

46:44.250 --> 46:46.520
We're not gonna have a problem
with billionaires anymore,

46:46.720 --> 46:48.500
check it out!

46:49.640 --> 46:51.750
(all cheering)

46:51.960 --> 46:54.960
Now people who can do stuff
will be just as poor

46:55.160 --> 46:56.330
as the rest of us!

46:56.530 --> 46:58.690
(excited clamoring)

46:58.900 --> 47:01.700
Tom, it appears that
everything is back to normal.

47:01.900 --> 47:04.430
Billionaires have been put
in their place and once again

47:04.630 --> 47:07.300
it doesn't matter that we
don't know how to do anything.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.810
It's a good ending here
and we can all be happy

47:10.010 --> 47:14.460
that everyone
is back in their universe.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.480
(screaming, panting)

47:21.680 --> 47:23.190
Mom! Mom!

47:23.390 --> 47:25.090
What is it, Mrs. Kennedy?

47:25.290 --> 47:26.620
Oh. Oh, Mom!

47:26.820 --> 47:28.590
I was just having
the worst nightmare.

47:28.790 --> 47:31.230
I was me except everyone
around me was different.

47:31.430 --> 47:32.730
Oh, no, Mrs. Kennedy.

47:32.930 --> 47:36.300
Here, have some of your favorite
cereal to calm you down.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.530
Oh, thank you. It was so real.

47:38.730 --> 47:40.170
All my friends were there
but they'd been

47:40.370 --> 47:41.500
replaced by strangers.

47:41.700 --> 47:43.410
I think you were even there
too, Kyle.

47:43.610 --> 47:45.480
Really? I was there, too?

47:45.680 --> 47:47.140
Yeah, that's right, Kyle,
you were there

47:47.340 --> 47:48.310
but you weren't cereal
and I couldn't

47:48.510 --> 47:49.510
just eat you like I can here.

47:49.710 --> 47:51.010
- (munching)
- (Kyle screaming)

47:51.210 --> 47:52.320
KYLE:
No, please, no, Mrs. Kennedy!

47:52.520 --> 47:53.920
Oh, you're so yummy, Kyle!

47:54.120 --> 47:56.250
Oh, oh, it's so good to be home.

47:56.450 --> 47:58.640
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
