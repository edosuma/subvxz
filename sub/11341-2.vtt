Hotch: Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:02.475 --> 00:04.580
Two women were found
in a park in Glendale, Arizona.

00:04.606 --> 00:06.606
Both of them were left
in that prayer position.

00:07.260 --> 00:08.825
Morgan: Our unsub could have
shot his victims anywhere,

00:08.850 --> 00:10.499
but he chose the heart,
suggesting that he's

00:10.500 --> 00:12.116
been hurt by somebody
close to him

00:12.117 --> 00:13.665
who's clearly
the center of his rage.

00:13.667 --> 00:14.730
Heather Clarke...

00:14.755 --> 00:16.686
It was announced in the paper
she was to be married.

00:16.687 --> 00:18.303
Shut up!
You never loved me!

00:18.305 --> 00:21.005
So Wallace killed Heather,
and when that didn't alleviate his rage,

00:21.007 --> 00:22.073
he began killing other women.

00:22.075 --> 00:23.859
He suffers from an acute
delusional disorder.

My client is innocent
of these charges.

He's been wrongfully arrested
for crimes he did not commit.

00:58.512 --> 01:01.513

jumping the gun.

doesn't work, people.

profiling, whatever.

assumptions instead of facts,

he and his brother turned 3.

02:13.754 --> 02:15.137
His adoptive parents
kept his first name,

02:15.162 --> 02:16.656
raised him in Phoenix,

02:16.657 --> 02:18.974
and he came to Glendale
5 years ago for work.

02:18.976 --> 02:21.343

Wallace, and their mother?

02:21.345 --> 02:22.204
Sort of--ellipses--

02:22.243 --> 02:24.351
and about a year ago he
unsealed his adoption record.

02:24.481 --> 02:26.631
So, he knew he had a twin.

02:26.633 --> 02:28.650
He could have inserted himself
into the investigation

02:28.652 --> 02:30.318

11:24.478 --> 11:26.261
There.

11:26.263 --> 11:28.413
Just something that I do.

11:28.415 --> 11:31.666
I've done it for as long
as I can remember.

11:31.668 --> 11:34.052
I went to grade school
with this girl.

11:34.054 --> 11:36.438
She used to, uh, pull out
her own hair and eat it.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.672
Is it like that?

11:37.674 --> 11:39.457
Gross.

11:39.459 --> 11:41.426
You're judging <i>her?</i>

11:41.428 --> 11:45.914
All I know is that
when I kill...

11:45.916 --> 11:50.602
Or even think
about doing it,

11:50.604 --> 11:53.622
I...

11:53.624 --> 11:56.124
I feel better.

11:58.377 --> 12:02.497
You don't need jail.

12:02.499 --> 12:04.199
You need help.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.301
Yeah.

12:06.303 --> 12:08.470
Who's gonna help me?

12:08.472 --> 12:10.955
I am.

12:10.957 --> 12:14.125
For better or worse,
we're related.

12:14.127 --> 12:17.295
Which means it's my job
to protect you.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.898
So we're gonna stay here,
until the cops chill out,

12:19.900 --> 12:21.066
and then...

12:21.068 --> 12:23.101
We'll cross the border
into Canada

12:23.103 --> 12:25.520
where you can get treatment.

12:25.522 --> 12:29.040
I tried that.
It didn't work.

12:30.660 --> 12:33.094
What's that?

12:33.096 --> 12:34.746
It's a heavy duty sedative.

12:34.748 --> 12:37.249
It'll knock you out
for 16 hours.

12:37.251 --> 12:39.751
I'm not taking it.

12:42.088 --> 12:45.540
Hey, look, we do this my way
or we don't do it at all.

12:45.542 --> 12:49.844
And if don't do it, then my
next phone call is to the cops.

13:01.390 --> 13:03.858
Let me see
if you've swallowed it.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.944
Ahh...

13:17.940 --> 13:21.076
[Retching]

13:28.050 --> 13:30.135
P.A.: Train to 24th
Street station departing...

13:30.137 --> 13:32.070
[Train horn blows]

13:32.072 --> 13:35.724
P.A.: Train to 24th Street
station departing on platform 2.

13:35.726 --> 13:38.893
[Train bell ringing]

13:38.895 --> 13:41.596
[Train horn blows]

13:45.568 --> 13:48.937
We have eyes on Carla Hines.
She's approaching now.

13:54.243 --> 13:58.229
Nobody move until
we have Wallace.

14:04.036 --> 14:06.404
Any potential targets
in the area?

14:06.406 --> 14:07.756
Negative.

14:11.093 --> 14:12.594
Morgan:
Wallace must be late.

14:12.596 --> 14:15.830
She's not sticking around.

14:15.832 --> 14:17.549
Go. Go. Go.

14:19.819 --> 14:21.269
Carla Hines?

14:21.271 --> 14:22.637
I'm with the FBI.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.606
We need to talk.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.681
Mm...

15:39.683 --> 15:41.599
Danny?

15:42.918 --> 15:44.452
No.

15:44.454 --> 15:46.137
Not Danny.

15:46.139 --> 15:47.255
[Gasps, screams]

15:47.257 --> 15:49.023
[Gunshot]

15:56.839 --> 15:59.992
Why were you
at the station?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.931
I know that you think
that if you don't say anything,

16:05.933 --> 16:08.250
you can't
incriminate Wallace.

16:08.252 --> 16:12.571
But the only way
he survives this is if you help us.

16:12.573 --> 16:14.789
I don't know where he is.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.258
I really don't.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.844
You can ask me
a hundred times and I swear to you,

16:18.846 --> 16:21.930
I don't know.

16:21.932 --> 16:23.982
I believe you.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.052
Then what else is there
to talk about?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.554
The more I know
about Wallace,

16:29.556 --> 16:32.657
the faster we'll be
able to find him.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.444
Why did you choose him
over Jesse?

16:40.533 --> 16:43.485
When I found out
that I was pregnant,

16:43.487 --> 16:46.204
I was so happy.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.674
But twins?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.277
Twins?

16:52.279 --> 16:53.111
Everybody kept telling me

16:53.136 --> 16:54.666
that it was gonna
get easier, you know?

16:55.399 --> 16:58.600
It never did.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.302
I was a single mom.

17:00.304 --> 17:02.104
I didn't have any money.

17:02.106 --> 17:04.473
I didn't have anyone
to help me.

17:04.474 --> 17:06.641
And then when they were two,

17:06.643 --> 17:08.226
they had this ear infection

17:08.228 --> 17:11.229
that they just passed
back and forth for 4 months.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.732
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.282
Well, there was
a stomach flu

17:15.285 --> 17:17.319
where my son and I
took turns throwing up.

17:17.320 --> 17:19.253
So you get it.

17:19.256 --> 17:20.771
You know.

17:20.773 --> 17:25.127
The--the just insanity
of knowing that...

17:25.128 --> 17:27.712
I couldn't do it
all by myself.

17:31.300 --> 17:36.338
And that's when I decided
that I had to let one of them go.

17:36.340 --> 17:38.590
[Sighs]

17:38.592 --> 17:42.077
But the morning
of the adoption, I...

17:42.079 --> 17:44.930
I hadn't decided.

17:44.932 --> 17:48.183
So I went
into their nursery

17:48.185 --> 17:50.952
and I just stared at them...

17:50.954 --> 17:53.655
Just sleeping.

17:53.657 --> 17:56.108
Perfect.

17:58.094 --> 18:00.412
And then Wallace
looked up at me

18:00.414 --> 18:04.382
and he said,
"I love you, mommy."

18:04.384 --> 18:06.651
And I knew.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.105
I chose Wallace.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.812
Why?

18:16.814 --> 18:18.380
Why what?

18:18.382 --> 18:19.764
Why me?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.433
Why him?

18:21.435 --> 18:23.168
Why couldn't I be
the perfect mom

18:23.170 --> 18:25.604
and have the perfect kids
like all the other moms?

18:25.606 --> 18:29.674
Why? I deserve that!

18:34.547 --> 18:37.482
Yes, you do.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.120
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

18:42.122 --> 18:45.707
Yeah, give me a minute
and I'll take you out, ok?

19:02.842 --> 19:04.676
Good morning.

19:04.678 --> 19:07.495
How long you been up?

19:09.031 --> 19:11.099
A while.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.524
Breakfast is in the bag.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.311
Hey, look, I gotta
go walk this dog, so--

19:23.313 --> 19:24.679
Jesse.

19:24.681 --> 19:27.549
You're not tying me up again.

19:27.551 --> 19:31.419
Or giving me any more pills.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.054
Just go.

19:33.056 --> 19:35.457
I'll be fine.

19:35.459 --> 19:38.026
I know why you're
doing all this.

19:38.028 --> 19:39.661
Really?

19:39.663 --> 19:41.062
Why?

19:41.064 --> 19:42.797
You want to be like me.

19:43.666 --> 19:45.467
No, I don't.

19:45.469 --> 19:47.435
Then why bring me here?

19:47.437 --> 19:50.922
Why try to understand me?
Why care?

19:50.924 --> 19:55.610
You want to know me
so you can be me.

19:58.814 --> 20:03.084
And that's why
I'm not gonna leave.

20:03.086 --> 20:06.137
Because I want that, too.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.327
I need to ask you
something else, Carla.

20:12.329 --> 20:13.695
About the father.

20:13.697 --> 20:16.548
What about him?

20:16.550 --> 20:18.700
Why did you burn
all the evidence of him?

20:18.702 --> 20:20.051
He's...

20:21.537 --> 20:23.822
He's not important.

20:23.824 --> 20:26.191
I think he's very important.

20:26.193 --> 20:28.927
He was some loser

20:28.929 --> 20:32.430
that I made a mistake
of sleeping with in college.

20:33.849 --> 20:35.834
He couldn't hack
being a dad,

20:35.836 --> 20:37.936
so fine. Fine.
Let him go.

20:37.938 --> 20:40.388
He deserves to have a life.

20:40.390 --> 20:42.190
Then when all this...

20:42.192 --> 20:44.526
started coming out,
I didn't want Jesse

20:44.528 --> 20:48.830
or Wallace or you
knocking on his door.

20:53.569 --> 20:56.504
You stopped believing me
just then.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.240
Because you're not
telling the truth.

21:00.209 --> 21:03.645
You don't burn
treasured mementos

21:03.647 --> 21:06.631
to make a loser's life
more convenient.

21:06.633 --> 21:10.135
Who's the father?

21:13.606 --> 21:17.309
You can believe
whatever you want.

21:17.311 --> 21:20.228
Who's the father?

21:25.634 --> 21:29.204
Thank you for
your cooperation.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.625
Wait. So we're
letting her go now?

21:33.627 --> 21:35.943
She's holding back,
but she won't break.

21:35.945 --> 21:37.996
We have a better chance
of finding Wallace through her.

21:37.998 --> 21:39.798
We'll stick on her
like glue.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.517
Hotch: Meantime, we need to force
Wallace to make a move.

21:42.519 --> 21:44.002
Shouldn't be hard.
He's devolving.

21:44.004 --> 21:45.837
We just need
to get under his skin.

21:45.839 --> 21:48.156
Do you think Heather's
parents would help us?

21:48.158 --> 21:50.308
Making a move in the second...

21:50.310 --> 21:52.143
Jet fighters bombed
a guerrilla base...

21:52.145 --> 21:55.380
We interrupt our broadcast to bring
you this life press conference.

21:55.382 --> 21:58.983
This is a message to Wallace.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.121
We know how you felt
about our daughter.

22:03.123 --> 22:05.740
And so we are asking you,

22:05.742 --> 22:07.475
as parents,

22:07.477 --> 22:10.445
to turn yourself in.

22:10.447 --> 22:15.250
So please stop hurting
other people

22:15.252 --> 22:16.935
and turn your--

22:18.454 --> 22:20.472
Wallace.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.547
Come here.

22:33.102 --> 22:37.171
What is it?

22:37.173 --> 22:40.725
You hate me, don't you?

22:40.727 --> 22:43.645
I don't hate you.
I love you.

22:43.647 --> 22:45.563
I love you so much,

22:45.565 --> 22:49.651
I'm gonna eat...You...Up.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.711
I'm ok, I'm ok, I'm ok!

22:59.713 --> 23:01.746
I'm ok!
Jesse!

23:01.748 --> 23:03.381
Ohh!
Jesse.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.632
Oh, my God,
how have you been?

23:04.634 --> 23:06.033
What? I--

23:06.035 --> 23:07.385
I didn't see you
at the dog park,

23:07.387 --> 23:10.422
and then I saw the news
and I was like, are you kidding?

23:10.424 --> 23:12.924
I mean, no offense,
but what your brother did...

23:12.926 --> 23:14.342
It's crazy.
What your brother did...

23:14.344 --> 23:15.727
It's crazy.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.730
But you can't let that
bother you, ok?

23:18.732 --> 23:20.465
You're not Wallace.

23:20.467 --> 23:24.068
I can't. I can't talk
to you right now.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.172
I don't--
I don't feel so good.

23:27.174 --> 23:29.357
No problem.

23:29.359 --> 23:31.860
Let me know if I can do--

23:37.833 --> 23:39.167
how did we do?

23:39.169 --> 23:40.452
Oh, you did great.

23:40.454 --> 23:42.353
Not a lot of parents
can stand in front of cameras

23:42.355 --> 23:43.671
and say that.

23:43.673 --> 23:47.742
We just...
thought of Heather.

23:47.744 --> 23:49.878
Alex.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.850
Mrs. Clarke: He's done it again,
hasn't he?

23:55.852 --> 23:58.636
Excuse me.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.029
[Camera clicking]

24:08.031 --> 24:10.865
Reid: Wallace's M.O.--the rape,
the bullet through the heart.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.116
He even tried to pose her.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.485
He didn't try
to force-feed her,

24:13.487 --> 24:15.069
which is his signature.

24:15.071 --> 24:16.488
And this crime scene...

24:16.490 --> 24:18.623
Organized, skilled,
got in and out without detection.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.642
Exactly. If Wallace
is losing it,

24:20.644 --> 24:22.327
he wouldn't
be capable of this.

24:22.329 --> 24:23.828
Maybe he re-evolved.

24:23.830 --> 24:27.665
Or we have a copycat
who's a literal copy.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.568
Jesse? But why start now?
Why this victim?

24:34.790 --> 24:37.675
Mr. Randall, what time did you
check on your sister?

24:37.677 --> 24:40.461
This morning.

24:40.463 --> 24:43.648
She didn't respond
to my calls or texts.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.350
It's not like her.

24:45.352 --> 24:46.801
We're close.

24:46.803 --> 24:47.986
Close in age, right?

24:47.988 --> 24:50.538
Yeah. We're twins.

24:50.540 --> 24:51.973
You're fraternal twins.

24:51.975 --> 24:54.859
Yeah. How'd you know?

24:56.161 --> 24:58.479
It was Jesse.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.572
[Horn honks]
Jesse, wait!

25:07.574 --> 25:09.424
Oh. Hey, Elizabeth.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.379
I just want to apologize
about before.

25:15.664 --> 25:18.016
Right. Before.

25:18.018 --> 25:21.803
I was thinking about
what I said about your brother.

25:21.805 --> 25:24.956
I might have come across
a little insensitive.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.395
I tell you what.

25:30.397 --> 25:32.313
Why don't you
come on in,

25:32.315 --> 25:34.232
and we'll talk about it.

25:34.234 --> 25:35.817
Yeah, of course.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.161
All I was trying to say is,

25:47.163 --> 25:49.881
this is all gonna blow over
once they catch the right guy.

25:49.883 --> 25:52.850
I guess.

25:52.852 --> 25:56.421
It's just...sometimes...

25:57.556 --> 26:00.425
It's hard to tell
who the right guy is.

26:01.944 --> 26:03.845
Isn't that right, Wallace?

26:08.717 --> 26:12.437
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

26:12.439 --> 26:14.422
No, no, no, no.

26:14.424 --> 26:17.442
[Crying]

26:17.444 --> 26:18.943
You were right.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.478
I am like you.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.247
I've always been like you.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.833
That's why you found me,
isn't it?

26:28.370 --> 26:29.954
Yeah.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.106
And I know this is gonna
sound totally weird,

26:32.108 --> 26:36.678
but I was hoping we could
do this one together.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.047
That's not weird.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.934
It's not weird at all.

26:59.890 --> 27:01.842
The victim was Elizabeth Nash.

27:01.843 --> 27:02.669
Her car's missing.

27:02.694 --> 27:04.895
Sergeant Johnson's
running an APB on it now.

27:05.730 --> 27:06.979
You see it?

27:06.981 --> 27:08.397
See what?

27:09.483 --> 27:12.067
Sperm clusters, all over.

27:12.069 --> 27:13.702
They raped her together.

27:13.704 --> 27:15.154
Shot and posed her
postmortem.

27:15.156 --> 27:16.555
Signature?

27:16.557 --> 27:19.191
They cut off her own finger
and fed it to her.

27:19.193 --> 27:22.978
Well, that could be Wallace,
it could be Jesse, it could be both.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.631
One twin's behavior
is inspiring the others.

27:25.633 --> 27:27.933
Well, we have
two psychopaths

27:27.935 --> 27:29.618
who have found the perfect partner
in each other.

27:29.620 --> 27:32.655
I don't think it's a partnership,
I think it's a trap.

27:32.657 --> 27:34.489
Jesse's previous victim
was a fraternal twin.

27:34.491 --> 27:36.408
I think that's the surrogate
for his real anger.

27:36.410 --> 27:37.993
Jesse's the discarded son.

27:37.995 --> 27:40.495
Of course. He'd be
furious at his brother.

27:40.497 --> 27:42.014
Well, why not
just kill Wallace?

27:42.016 --> 27:43.482
I think he's planning to,

27:43.484 --> 27:46.018
as soon as he can't frame
Wallace for any more murders.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.303
Bad news.

27:47.305 --> 27:48.437
We lost Carla.

27:48.439 --> 27:49.405
How?

27:49.407 --> 27:50.556
She went into
a restaurant

27:50.558 --> 27:52.041
and disappeared
out the back.

27:52.043 --> 27:53.709
There was a car waiting.

27:53.711 --> 27:56.896
She couldn't have done
that without help.

27:56.898 --> 27:59.365
I'm ahead of you, sir.
Garcia.

27:59.367 --> 28:01.483
Carla's gone radio silent,
but I'm checking her records

28:01.485 --> 28:02.744
to see who she contacted last.

28:02.745 --> 28:04.789
And it is...

28:04.790 --> 28:06.340
Holy shylock.

28:11.796 --> 28:13.913
We're with the FBI.

28:13.938 --> 28:15.634
Everyone step away
from your computers.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.962
You, you're gonna write down
the wireless pass code for us.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.264
Nod your head if you
intend to cooperate.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.832
Good. You get to keep
practicing law today.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.083
Where's Mark Anderson?

28:24.085 --> 28:26.085
In there.

28:26.087 --> 28:28.888
Agents, I can explain.

28:28.890 --> 28:30.506
You helped Carla Hines
escape.

28:30.508 --> 28:33.810
I can't comment on that because
of attorney-client privilege.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.578
Except the fact
that she is your client,

28:35.580 --> 28:36.457
which means she an Jesse

28:36.482 --> 28:38.283
know each other and
probably have for a while.

28:39.067 --> 28:40.600
I...It's complicated.

28:40.602 --> 28:41.643
It's actually very simple.

28:41.668 --> 28:43.487
We can now prove
that Jesse is a killer.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.137
Which makes you
an accessory.

28:45.139 --> 28:47.073
Hold on there.
I'm their lawyer.

28:47.075 --> 28:48.524
And you can threaten me
all you want,

28:48.526 --> 28:50.660
but they're entitled to representation,
and you know that.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.396
And I also know you, and all
those cameras that you love so much,

28:53.398 --> 28:55.682
they're all downstairs
waiting for your perp walk.

28:55.684 --> 28:57.000
You're bluffing.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.167
JJ.

28:58.169 --> 28:59.385
Wait.

28:59.387 --> 29:02.789
I, uh, I don't know
where Jesse and Carla are.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.841
What more do you want?

29:04.843 --> 29:06.843
So, that super helpful
law firm

29:06.845 --> 29:10.079
gave me some curious intel
regarding Jesse and his mom.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.848
How far back does
the relationship go?

29:11.850 --> 29:15.167
According to some legally
binding documents, 3 months.

29:15.169 --> 29:17.303
See, Carla was doing a little
planning for the future

29:17.305 --> 29:19.222
and she utilized
said law firm to set up a trust,

29:19.224 --> 29:22.091
with two trustees.
Can you guess their names? Can you?

29:22.093 --> 29:23.776
Wallace and Jesse?

29:23.778 --> 29:25.678
Wrong. Well, half wrong.
Jesse is named,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.464
but the other mysterious
trustee is Bill Robbins.

29:28.466 --> 29:30.099
And who's that, mama?

29:30.101 --> 29:31.734
Mm-hmm. You haven't heard
that name yet, have you?

29:31.736 --> 29:34.771
Bill Robbins went to college
with Carla 30 years ago.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.938
Mm-hmm.
Thanks, baby girl.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.707
30 years ago is when
she conceived the twins.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.042
Bill Robbins must be
the father.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.860
And this trust is why
she burned any mention of him.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.328
If we found out
who Bill Robbins was,

29:42.330 --> 29:43.830
we find the paper trail
that connected Carla to Jesse.

29:43.832 --> 29:46.249
Not to mention that he could
know where Wallace and Jesse are.

29:46.251 --> 29:47.550
All right, you two
talk to Bill Robbins.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.368
I'm going to have
another shot at the lawyer.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.326
It he's representing
the whole family,

29:50.351 --> 29:52.351
he knows more
than he's telling us.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.976
We can't stay
out in the open.

29:56.978 --> 29:59.896
The cops are looking
for us in this thing.

29:59.898 --> 30:04.016
What about mom?
Would she help us?

30:04.018 --> 30:05.217
Maybe.

30:05.219 --> 30:08.053
If we don't tell her
what we've done.

30:08.055 --> 30:09.856
Is there a place
we can all go?

30:09.858 --> 30:11.407
Yeah.

30:11.409 --> 30:14.744
Where mom always took me
to feel safe.

30:14.746 --> 30:17.080
Where is that?

30:17.082 --> 30:19.198
Church.

30:22.202 --> 30:23.786
I don't know
what else you want.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.254
You've got the files.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.623
I want you to understand
exactly where you sit.

30:27.625 --> 30:30.143
You belong to the FBI and you're
going to tell us everything

30:30.145 --> 30:31.778
that's not in those files.

30:33.947 --> 30:35.982
Who contacted you first,
Carla or Jesse?

30:35.984 --> 30:37.583
I don't know.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.969
I helped him unseal
his record a year ago.

30:39.971 --> 30:42.755
He didn't bring it up again until
he brought her in as a client.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.440
Told me to do
whatever she needed.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.643
And that's when
you set up the trust?

30:47.645 --> 30:49.595
Yeah.

30:49.597 --> 30:53.116
And from the beginning,
the whole thing was bizarre.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.451
I mean, the way she talked
to me about Jesse--

30:55.453 --> 30:57.653
"he's the son
I should have kept.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.271
I'll have the perfect
family now."

30:59.273 --> 31:02.475
And setting up the trust
was her way of proving it to him.

31:02.477 --> 31:05.294
That's why she named the father.
It was all part of a manipulation.

31:05.296 --> 31:06.679
Well, it worked.

31:06.681 --> 31:08.881
Jesse signed everything.

31:08.883 --> 31:11.417
But when I went to go get
the dad's signature,

31:11.419 --> 31:14.687
that's when I found out just
how messed up that family was.

31:14.689 --> 31:16.189
How's that?

31:16.191 --> 31:19.025
Well, you've met
Bill Robbins, haven't you?

31:19.027 --> 31:23.646
[Baby crying, dog barking]

31:25.983 --> 31:27.733
[Knocking]

31:32.022 --> 31:33.639
How you doin'? FBI.

31:33.641 --> 31:36.342
We're looking for
a Mr. Bill Robbins.

31:36.344 --> 31:38.644
The sun and the moon
have arrived.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.447
I'm ready to join you
in your golden chariot.

31:42.637 --> 31:44.100
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

31:44.125 --> 31:45.752
if you have a moment.

31:45.753 --> 31:47.987
Yes.

31:47.989 --> 31:51.323
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

31:51.325 --> 31:54.110
My life is the answer
to your questions.

31:54.112 --> 31:55.461
Come in. Come in.

31:55.463 --> 31:57.213
Uh, sit.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.682
Full-scale psychotic
break when he turned 25,

31:59.684 --> 32:01.717
right after Jesse
was put up for adoption.

32:01.719 --> 32:04.887
Well, no wonder his sons
turned out the way they did.

32:04.889 --> 32:06.722
Schizophrenics
are rarely psychopathic.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.858
If the twins are predisposed
genetically to kill,

32:08.860 --> 32:10.843
they didn't get it
from their father.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.696
Where are my manners?
Have a seat. Have a seat.

32:16.650 --> 32:18.801
Do you like my artwork?

32:18.803 --> 32:20.970
Yeah, I do.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.322
Is that your feces?

32:26.076 --> 32:27.660
Maybe.

32:29.413 --> 32:34.100
So mom's been manipulating
Jesse from the beginning.

32:34.102 --> 32:35.651
To do what?

32:35.653 --> 32:36.736
To kill Wallace.

32:36.738 --> 32:38.087
Is she capable
of that?

32:38.089 --> 32:39.589
She's a vindictive narcissist

32:39.591 --> 32:42.258
whose entire self-image is wrapped
up in being the perfect mother.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.843
Why couldn't I be
the perfect mom

32:43.845 --> 32:46.312
and have the perfect kids
like all the other moms?

32:46.314 --> 32:48.097
I deserve that!

32:48.099 --> 32:50.900
Ok, I can buy narcissist,

32:50.902 --> 32:54.220
but I can't buy murderer,
not of her own child.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.772
She said that she chose Wallace
because he validated her from the crib

32:56.774 --> 32:58.724
and that's he's been
a disappointment ever since.

32:58.726 --> 32:59.964
If she wanted Wallace dead,

32:59.989 --> 33:01.495
why did she try to meet him
at the station?

33:01.496 --> 33:03.746
She wasn't there to meet Wallace,
she was there to meet Jesse.

33:03.748 --> 33:04.914
How do you know?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.449
She didn't buy a ticket.

33:06.451 --> 33:08.768
She was there to make sure
that the plan was in motion.

33:08.770 --> 33:09.919
But Jesse didn't show.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.320
Well, he's got his own plan.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.522
He's much less malleable
that she thought.

33:13.524 --> 33:15.491
So she's improvising now.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.377
She's got to find a way
to bring both boys together.

33:18.379 --> 33:23.616
And this time she's not going
to leave anything to chance.

33:23.618 --> 33:26.085
She'll make sure Jesse does it.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.588
Her ideal scenario--
Jesse kills Wallace

33:28.590 --> 33:31.190
and she gets to stay
the perfect mother.

33:43.271 --> 33:47.107
My boys.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.957
Can the father answer
any questions right now?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.927
You have to understand,
eggs are the devil's cholesterol.

34:06.929 --> 34:08.344
It's hit or miss.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.675
Ask him if Carla or the twins
visited him recently?

34:10.676 --> 34:12.143
If not, found out if there's

34:12.168 --> 34:14.418
any shared family history
before the adoption.

34:14.763 --> 34:17.831
We'll do what we can,
but we might need a plan B.

34:19.266 --> 34:23.020
Oh, my God, Wallace,
what have you done now?

34:23.022 --> 34:25.772
Mom, stop. We need
some money and your car.

34:25.774 --> 34:27.074
Can you help us?

34:27.076 --> 34:29.376
Of course I can.

34:29.378 --> 34:31.712
You're my babies.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.033
Jesse,

34:36.034 --> 34:39.235
look at you.

34:39.237 --> 34:41.388
I have waited
so long

34:41.389 --> 34:43.072
for this moment.

34:43.074 --> 34:45.324
Me, too.

34:45.327 --> 34:48.879
Well, this is quite
the family reunion, isn't it?

34:48.880 --> 34:52.815
I just wish that it
could go on forever.

34:52.818 --> 34:54.568
Well, it can't.

34:54.570 --> 34:55.552
We gotta go.

34:55.554 --> 34:57.087
Wait a minute.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.307
I just want to hold you
one more time.

35:00.309 --> 35:02.159
Mom, not now. Jeez!

35:02.161 --> 35:04.595
Wallace.

35:04.597 --> 35:06.647
Make time for this.

35:06.649 --> 35:08.565
Yes, Wallace.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.984
Make time
for your mother.

35:14.105 --> 35:17.324
Mr. Robbins, have you seen
your sons lately?

35:17.326 --> 35:20.110
Yes, Wallace and Jesse.
Wallace is the older one.

35:20.112 --> 35:23.113
He's teachable.
I can teach him things.

35:23.115 --> 35:25.532
But Jesse
looks more like me.

35:25.534 --> 35:26.767
When was the last time
that you saw them?

35:26.769 --> 35:28.652
Not long ago.

35:28.654 --> 35:31.255
One was potty-trained,
but the other wasn't.

35:31.257 --> 35:32.339
They were toddlers.

35:32.341 --> 35:34.791
And they were crying
because Carla was crying.

35:34.793 --> 35:37.628
And a magical woman
took Jesse away.

35:37.630 --> 35:40.430
He's describing the adoption.

35:40.432 --> 35:43.800
She was a Saint, letting
her son die like that.

35:43.802 --> 35:46.603
Who do you mean?
You mean Carla?

35:46.605 --> 35:49.473
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Not her.

35:49.475 --> 35:53.477
The woman
that took Jesse away.

35:53.479 --> 35:55.145
She was a Saint.

35:55.147 --> 35:57.948
She made the ultimate sacrifice.

35:57.950 --> 36:01.434
She let her son die.

36:01.436 --> 36:04.187
I know who he's talking about.

36:05.740 --> 36:07.708
St. Mary's.
The church St. Mary's?

36:07.710 --> 36:10.610
Reid: We think that's what
 the dad was describing to us.

36:10.612 --> 36:13.080
Yeah, JJ and I dug it up
when we were researching Jesse.

36:13.082 --> 36:14.614
It's the church
he was adopted through.

36:14.616 --> 36:16.083
It's also how Carla
would see herself,

36:16.085 --> 36:18.302
as the most revered
mother of all time.

36:18.304 --> 36:21.471
Have Sergeant Johnson
notify SWAT.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.240
What's the matter?

36:40.242 --> 36:42.526
You hate me, don't you?

36:42.528 --> 36:47.147
I do not hate you.

36:47.149 --> 36:48.749
I love you.

36:48.751 --> 36:52.819
I love you so much,
I want to just eat...

36:52.821 --> 36:54.705
You...

36:54.707 --> 36:56.540
Up.

37:02.213 --> 37:04.514
Do it fast.

37:05.717 --> 37:07.851
Aah! No!

37:07.853 --> 37:10.754
Jesse?

37:10.756 --> 37:12.005
What are you doing?

37:12.007 --> 37:14.691
I spent some quality
time with Wallace, Mom.

37:14.693 --> 37:17.611
And I've discovered that I've
got more in common with him

37:17.613 --> 37:19.329
than with you.

37:20.732 --> 37:23.066
Jesse,
you put do that cleaver.

37:23.068 --> 37:24.151
Just listen to me.

37:24.153 --> 37:27.487
No, you listen to me!
Don't you hurt her.

37:27.489 --> 37:29.773
Do you even know
who she is?

37:29.775 --> 37:31.291
She's our mother.

37:31.293 --> 37:32.926
Mother?

37:32.928 --> 37:35.028
She abandoned me!

37:35.030 --> 37:38.698
And then she tried
to convince me to kill you.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.450
You're lying!
I'm not!

37:40.452 --> 37:41.618
She wouldn't do that.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.637
She begged me to do it.

37:44.639 --> 37:47.224
Did you say yes?

37:49.477 --> 37:50.744
Yeah, I did.

37:50.746 --> 37:54.097
But I couldn't
go through with it.

37:54.099 --> 37:55.098
It's not true.

37:55.100 --> 37:58.902
I'm like you, remember?

38:04.058 --> 38:07.227
I want you do do exactly
as I told you to do.

38:07.229 --> 38:09.846
Do you hear me?
Exactly!

38:09.848 --> 38:11.448
Raise the gun.

38:11.450 --> 38:14.685
Raise it a little higher.
A little higher.

38:14.687 --> 38:16.086
Pull the trigger.

38:16.088 --> 38:17.454
Pull it.

38:24.512 --> 38:25.512
Fine.

38:25.514 --> 38:27.597
Aah! Uhh!

38:36.774 --> 38:37.808
[Gunshot]

38:37.810 --> 38:39.526
FBI!

38:39.528 --> 38:41.027
FBI!

38:41.029 --> 38:42.863
Drop your weapon now!

38:44.532 --> 38:47.784
Wallace was out of control.

38:47.786 --> 38:49.302
He forced us to come here.

38:49.304 --> 38:50.570
He was gonna shoot us both.

38:50.572 --> 38:54.774
Thank God Jesse
was stronger than he was.

38:54.776 --> 38:56.943
I'll only talk
to my lawyer.

38:56.945 --> 38:58.295
Take them both into custody.

38:58.297 --> 39:00.113
Show me your hands.

39:12.977 --> 39:15.128
We'll fingerprint him
at the station,

39:15.130 --> 39:16.546
see who matches who.

39:16.548 --> 39:19.433
Fingerprint analysis
isn't an exact science.

39:19.435 --> 39:21.801
A good defense lawyer
can poke holes in it.

39:21.803 --> 39:26.339
Juries expect DNA, and DNA
isn't gonna make the case here.

39:26.341 --> 39:27.741
No, but behavior might.

39:27.743 --> 39:30.327
Sergeant, I need you
to do something.

39:34.615 --> 39:36.666
[Siren]

39:42.256 --> 39:45.041
Mr. Robbins,
which son is this?

39:59.307 --> 40:01.358
Oh. That's Wallace.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.562
He's teachable. I taught him to do that
whenever he gets nervous.

40:05.564 --> 40:07.430
Wallace Hines,
you're under arrest.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.684
Mom?

40:11.686 --> 40:14.037
Mom, what do I do now?

40:14.039 --> 40:17.207
Mommy, no!

40:17.209 --> 40:19.692
Mom!

40:26.801 --> 40:29.219
"They mess you up,
your mom and dad.

40:29.221 --> 40:31.555
"They may not mean to,
but they do.

40:31.557 --> 40:33.873
"They fill you with
the faults they had

40:33.875 --> 40:36.343
and add some extra
just for you."

40:36.345 --> 40:38.595
Philip Larkin.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.737
Pretty impressive.

40:47.739 --> 40:52.725
A case that could have
ended with egg on our face

40:52.727 --> 40:54.160
turns out
to be one of those,

40:54.162 --> 40:57.831
"did you hear about this?"
Stories on the Internet.

40:57.833 --> 41:02.235
Apparently the BAU
is trending on Twitter.

41:02.237 --> 41:05.438
Whatever that means.

41:05.440 --> 41:09.192
I've just heard that
the Attorney General is very pleased.

41:10.428 --> 41:14.297
Now, they seldom call
with just good news.

41:14.299 --> 41:16.616
They were also so happy
with the way things turned out

41:16.618 --> 41:18.785
that unfortunately,
they've withdrawn my name

41:18.787 --> 41:20.720
as a candidate
for section chief.

41:20.722 --> 41:22.856
I'll drink to that.

41:24.308 --> 41:26.776
So...

41:26.778 --> 41:29.813
That means we've
got a new boss.

41:29.815 --> 41:31.031
Any idea who?

41:31.033 --> 41:32.499
They didn't say,

41:32.501 --> 41:35.201
but they did say that they
were thinking outside the box.

41:35.203 --> 41:36.336
Uh-oh.

41:36.338 --> 41:38.305
Exactly.

41:38.307 --> 41:41.107
Well, whatever happens,

41:41.109 --> 41:44.411
I'm sure it will be
interesting.

41:45.496 --> 41:48.298
It always is.
