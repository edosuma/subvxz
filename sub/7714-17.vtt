00:04.004 --> 00:05.671
Hello, hello.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.424
Top of the morning to you.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.675
(EXCLAlMS)

00:09.759 --> 00:13.595
Green M&M's.
Nature's Viagra.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.307
Two of my favorite
joke areas combined.
lt's gonna be a good day.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.559
l don't want to
bring my friends.

00:18.643 --> 00:19.643
Why can't it
just be the two of us?

00:19.728 --> 00:21.311
Because it's
St. Patrick's Day.
People go out in groups.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.396
Well, why don't you
invite your friends?

00:22.480 --> 00:23.647
Why are you being
so weird about this?

00:23.732 --> 00:26.692
Stop fighting ! Just on
St. Patrick's Day, okay?

00:26.776 --> 00:29.528
Just one
perfect day a year.

00:29.612 --> 00:33.157
No hassles,
no problems, no kids.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.867
Why no kids?

00:34.951 --> 00:36.368
Yeah, where are your kids?

00:36.453 --> 00:38.954
Nope. Uh-uh. Not today.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.373
MlCHAEL: It is
St. Patrick's Day,

00:41.458 --> 00:45.044
and here
in Scranton,
that is a huge deal.

00:45.503 --> 00:49.757
lt is the closest
that the lrish will
ever get to Christmas.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.616
Oh, thank you.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.867

Hey!

01:19.579 --> 01:20.662
Hey.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.291
DWlGHT: Very good.
Okay, we'll get back to you
on that right away. Thanks.

01:26.377 --> 01:27.419
What do we got here?

01:27.504 --> 01:29.004
Mega-desk.
Of course.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.422
Command central.
Mmm-hmm.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.674
Surveillance, gaming
and business.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.010
Okay.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.931
(SlGHS)

01:39.015 --> 01:43.102
What? Come on. Jim !

01:43.603 --> 01:45.104
Tweedledee and
Tweedle Dumbass

01:45.188 --> 01:47.064
have been away
on maternity leave,

01:47.148 --> 01:49.983
but now Tweedle Dumbass
is back and we have
a problem.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.529
Yes, getting
hooked on mega-desk
was my own damn fault.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.240
(SlGHS) I don't care
about assigning blame.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.660
All I care about is mega-desk.

01:59.744 --> 02:05.040
That is
all l care about.
Getting more mega-desk.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.086
Oh, l love this.
So much fun.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.630
There's such team spirit
in this room.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.423
Morning, darling.
Morning.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.093
Well, this is my last day
at the Scranton branch
for a while,

02:16.177 --> 02:18.095
but I'm leaving it in
the very capable hands

02:18.179 --> 02:20.597
of some of the
loveliest people I've ever
had the pleasure of knowing.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.142
You know,
l'm gonna miss this place,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.476
and the snow.

02:24.561 --> 02:28.730
(LAUGHS) Do my dogs
love peeing in that snow!

02:28.815 --> 02:30.816
Makes me think
they're onto something.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.900
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

02:31.985 --> 02:33.443
Oh, good morning,
sweetheart.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.571
Good morning, honey pile.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.990
l'm sorry,
but is that a gift
l see in your hands?

02:38.074 --> 02:40.492
lt is.
This is a little
something for you

02:40.577 --> 02:43.287
to remember your time here
in Scranton by.

02:44.747 --> 02:45.873
ls that a lump of coal?

02:45.957 --> 02:46.999
Yes, it is.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.167
l haven't been that naughty.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.170
No, no, no. That is
a good gift, actually.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.006
Buildings here in Scranton
are literally powered by coal.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.508
Uh. . . Thank you very much.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.011
We don't
get much coal
down in Tallahassee.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.679
l mean,
just alligators

03:00.763 --> 03:02.472
and some of the worst
Chinese food you've
ever tasted.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.725
Mmm, that sounds
great, actually.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.686
Well, if you
ever get down in
my neck of the woods,

03:07.770 --> 03:09.438
you got a place to stay.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.773
MlCHAEL: When
you work for Sabre,
only one thing matters,

03:11.858 --> 03:16.528
and l don't care
if you're a loser or
you practice bestiality,

03:16.779 --> 03:18.906
if Jo likes you,
you are in.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.200
And l am in.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.495
Erin Go Bragh.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.706
Andy "Go Bragh" to you.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.499
Nice kilt.
Thanks.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.044
lt's actually my sister's
old field hockey skirt.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.005
Erin and l have
our first date tonight
and it has to be perfect.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.549
Why? Because according
to How l Met Your Mother,

03:37.634 --> 03:40.636
that's the date
that your kids are gonna
wait patiently to hear about,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.888
and you better have
a good story for them.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.059
Nope.
Great.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.143
JlM: No.
Thank you.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.645
No, no, no, no, no.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.480
Come on. Come on.
Five more minutes.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.066
Five more minutes
of mega-desk? Please?

03:58.488 --> 03:59.821
ls this yours or mine?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.324
They say that
no man is an island.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.704
False. l am an island,
and this island is volcanic.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.039
Mega-desk!

04:09.123 --> 04:14.503
And it is about to erupt
with the molten hot lava
of strategy.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.173
Good Lord.
l can't believe
l'm missing this.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.925
PAM: It's kind of Iike
that lip thing she did
last night,

04:20.009 --> 04:22.010
like a half-snarl,
haIf-smiIe.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.762
I get the sense
that she's very ironic.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.598
Okay. Love you.
We'll talk soon.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.394
Must be amazing
being a father, right?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.687
The miracle of life.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.355
lt is. Big time.

04:33.439 --> 04:37.693
Ah, that baby
is just discovering
a whole wide world right now.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.612
lt's pretty amazing.
What up is, what down is,

04:40.697 --> 04:43.115
who Mom is,
who Dad is.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.951
Must be
tough being here
with all that going on.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.036
lt's tough being here
for a lot of reasons.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.705
l mean,
you're here at work

04:49.789 --> 04:53.166
and the baby thinks that
the refrigerator is
its father.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.585
ls that what
happened to you?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.629
l'll tell you
what happened to me.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.382
l didn't see my father for
the first two years of
my life.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.927
l thought my mother
was my father and my
wet nurse was my mother.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.554
And that's
a common mistake.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.973
Turned out fine
for me. But Mose?

05:08.850 --> 05:12.853
Oh, same story,
different ending.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.774
(SNEEZlNG)

05:19.193 --> 05:20.902
Hey, are you sick?

05:20.987 --> 05:23.488
Oh, no, l'm fine. l just
have a little indigestion.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.824
ln your nose?
Yes.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.037
ERIN: l'm a little sick,
but I don't want to miss
my date with Andy.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.330
l'll get better.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.498
Whenever l'm sick
it goes away
within a few hours,

05:33.583 --> 05:37.419
except once when
l was in the hospital
from age three to six.

05:38.046 --> 05:42.132
Now, after all the talking
l've been doing,
it's your turn.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.511
This is a town hall meeting.
l want to hear what y'all
sound like.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.472
That is a great idea, J. B.
Thank you.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.224
JO: You know,
l get way too many
ideas from the top.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.185
Now, l want to
hear your ideas.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.146
l mean,
did you guys know
that Liquid Paper,

05:56.230 --> 05:58.940
that wasn't invented
by some fancy engineer.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.777
No, that was created
by a lowly typist.

06:02.445 --> 06:06.865
Oh, Jo, l have an idea
for suntan lotion soap.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.159
You know,
it doesn't have
to be an invention.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.243
l have a question.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.204
Oscar, homosexual accountant.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.872
ln the training manual,
it says that

06:13.956 --> 06:16.875
there's a minority executive
training program
in Tallahassee.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.462
l am so proud
of Sabre's Print ln
All Colors initiative.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.883
Any Sabre employee of color
is welcome to apply, okay?

06:25.468 --> 06:26.468
Darryl?

06:26.552 --> 06:29.054
Darryl. Mellow, soulful,
smart for warehouse.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.555
Okay, hush now.
Okay.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.017
The Sabre
shipping method
could be more efficient.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.312
Combining inventory systems
makes sense on paper,

06:37.897 --> 06:40.232
but printers and paper
ship differently.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.776
lt would be faster
to deliver them separately

06:42.860 --> 06:44.319
instead of waiting
on everything to come in.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.904
But you wouldn't need
more trucks? l mean. . .

06:45.988 --> 06:48.907
Not at all.
There's a way
it can be scheduled.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.409
l sketched
this out downstairs.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.493
Well, look at you.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.913
Look at that picture
that you drew.
Nice job.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.748
We are very
proud of you.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.166
You know what? We are
going to tape that up

06:58.251 --> 06:59.709
on the refrigerator
in the kitchen.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.628
(CLlCKS TONGUE)
l like this, Darryl.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.755
l like this a lot.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.591
Maybe you should be
doing your sketching upstairs.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.759
Would you like
an office up here?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.678
Are you serious?
Yeah.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.929
Take Jim's old office.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.390
Oh, l set my stuff
up in there.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.185
So, just
give me a few minutes
to clean it out for you.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.645
Yeah. l want to
hear more from you.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.771
Absolutely.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.064
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

07:21.149 --> 07:25.110
Okay. Any questions?
Anything on anybody's mind?

07:25.194 --> 07:26.445
l'm leaving tonight.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.280
This is your last
chance for a while.

07:28.364 --> 07:32.159
No! Say
it's not so, Jo!
We're gonna miss you.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.952
We are gonna
miss you so much !

07:34.036 --> 07:35.036
Don't go away!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.414
Okay. Florida
ain't that far away.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.207
Well, l'm heading
down there.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.876
Well, anytime, now.
So, who. . .

07:40.960 --> 07:43.712
How about
July 4th weekend?

07:45.506 --> 07:46.840
Oh, honey,
you didn't buy a ticket.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.216
l did.

07:48.384 --> 07:52.262
Oh, honey,
l am not home very often,

07:52.763 --> 07:55.640
and me and my relatives,
they take up the guest house.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.142
l think you should
check with my office

07:57.226 --> 07:59.478
before you book
any dates, okay?

07:59.562 --> 08:02.647
You know what? ln the
spirit of full disclosure,

08:02.899 --> 08:05.525
l have actually reserved
a bunch of different seats

08:05.610 --> 08:06.776
on a bunch
of different flights,

08:06.861 --> 08:08.820
but there are
a couple flights that
only have two tickets left,

08:08.905 --> 08:09.905
so l think we should
pull the trigger. . .

08:09.989 --> 08:11.198
Enough !

08:16.245 --> 08:19.706
All right, everybody. Just
try to put a brave face on.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.250
Let's follow
the chain of events.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.502
Jo likes Michael,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.464
Jo invites
Michael to house,

08:27.882 --> 08:30.217
Jo doesn't like
Michael anymore.

08:32.929 --> 08:33.970

what you're doing right now.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.780
You are stressed
and l am taking
you to lunch.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.616
No, that's very
generous of you,
but l'm all set.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.700
No is not an option.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.118
Yes, it is.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.208
All right, well,
if you need me, l'll be on
the other side of that wall.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.377

twice for no.

09:05.461 --> 09:09.005

does it take to get
you to do some work?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.007

Okay. l'll be over there.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.389

09:17.473 --> 09:20.308
to be able to offer you
printer cartridges and

What?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.702
No. You need to stop now.

We'll be together then, now
We're going to have
a good time then

ask myself something.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.195
Do I even Iike her?

20:39.279 --> 20:43.574
As the lrish poet
Bobby McFerrin said,
"Don't worry, be happy."

20:44.159 --> 20:45.159
Whoops.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.913
Okay. Okay. All right.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.414
Best night ever.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.294
What the hell is
going on back there?

20:56.880 --> 21:01.509
JlM: Yeah. We should be
able to have that over
to you by Monday.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.428
Yeah, no problem.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.847
(CHUCKLlNG) Thank you.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.432
What the hell is this?

21:08.850 --> 21:10.101
Oh !
This is not mega-desk.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.853
No, it's not.
They call it
"quad-desk."

21:13.146 --> 21:15.439
That's ridiculous.
This is made up
of three desks.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.026
Oh, my God.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.029
We're gonna have to
rename it then,
aren't we?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.864

21:28.370 --> 21:29.537
Hello. Dwight Schrute.
