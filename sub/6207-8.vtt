- Raphael. Where is he?

00:14.931 --> 00:17.725
God? He's dead, Castiel.

00:18.434 --> 00:20.561
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

00:20.728 --> 00:23.856
- You're the one. You're my true vessel.
- That'll never happen.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.775
- You're the Michael Sword.
- What?

00:25.942 --> 00:27.818
- You're Michael's weapon.
- I'm a vessel?

00:27.985 --> 00:29.070
You're the vessel.

00:30.696 --> 00:32.365
You got a Trickster on your hands.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.992
- What is it? Spirit? Demon?
- More like demigods.

00:35.159 --> 00:38.162
They're immortal and they
can create things out of thin air.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.706
Usually with a sense of humor.
Deadly pranks.

00:40.873 --> 00:43.751
Bobby mentioned that these suckers
have a real sweet tooth.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.796
So this is fun for you?
Killing Dean over and over again?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.923
Sam, there's a lesson here.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.300
- What lesson?
- Dean's your weakness.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.720
The bad guys know it too.
It's gonna be the death of you, Sam.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.814
Oh, yeah.
All kinds of research. All night.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.150
Yeah? Hm.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.695
Whoo!

01:53.821 --> 01:55.323
Oh, Dean.

03:45.349 --> 03:47.268
It's called channel-surfing.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.689
- You ready?
- Are you?

03:52.940 --> 03:56.444
One more time.
The FBI is here why, exactly?

03:56.611 --> 03:59.906
Something to do with one of your locals
getting his head ripped off.

04:00.072 --> 04:03.993
- Bill Randolph died from a bear attack.
- How sure are you that it was a bear?

04:04.160 --> 04:05.328
What else would it be?

04:05.494 --> 04:08.664
Well, whatever it was, it chased
Mr. Randolph through the woods...

04:08.831 --> 04:11.209
...smashed through his front door,
followed him...

04:11.375 --> 04:13.836
...and killed him in his bedroom.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.172
Is that common? A bear doing all that?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.466
Depends how pissed off it is, I guess.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.094
Look, the Randolphs live
way up in high country.

04:22.261 --> 04:25.681
You got trout runs that'll make
a grown man weep and bears.

04:25.848 --> 04:29.685
Right. Now, what about Mrs. Randolph?
The file says she saw the whole thing.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.813
Yes, she did.
My heart goes out to that poor woman.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.482
She said bear?

04:37.568 --> 04:40.571
Kathy Randolph
went through a hell of a trauma.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.031
She's confused.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.327
What did she say?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.412
No, it must have been a bear.

04:48.579 --> 04:52.166
I mean, what else could it have been?

04:53.334 --> 04:56.629
Mrs. Randolph,
what did you think it was?

04:58.464 --> 05:00.383
Uh...

05:00.550 --> 05:04.470
No, I remember clearly now.
It was definitely a bear.

05:04.637 --> 05:09.433
We're sure it was.
But see, it helps us to hear every angle.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.936
So just tell us
what you thought you saw.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.481
Well...

05:15.898 --> 05:18.109
...it's impossible...

05:19.527 --> 05:22.363
...but I could have sworn I saw...

05:23.781 --> 05:26.409
...the Incredible Hulk.

05:31.956 --> 05:35.585
- The Incredible Hulk?
- I told you it was crazy.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.254
You, um...

05:40.965 --> 05:42.592
Bana or Norton?

05:42.758 --> 05:46.220
Oh, no. Those movies were terrible.
The TV Hulk.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.098
- Lou Ferrigno?
- Yes.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.267
- The spiky-hair Lou Ferrigno?
- Yes.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.895
Huh.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.982
- You think I'm crazy.
- No. Um...

05:58.774 --> 06:01.569
No, it's just... Is...?

06:02.153 --> 06:03.821
Is there, uh?

06:04.989 --> 06:10.036
Would there be any reason that
Lou Ferrigno, the Incredible Hulk, um...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.872
...would have a grudge
against your husband?

06:14.540 --> 06:15.583
No.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.503
No.

06:22.798 --> 06:24.550
- Hey.
- Find anything?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.512
Well, I saw the house.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.222
And?

06:29.388 --> 06:33.100
And there is a giant 8-foot-wide hole
where the front door used to be.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.728
- Almost like, uh...
- A Hulk-size hole?

06:36.812 --> 06:39.106
Maybe. What do you got?

06:39.273 --> 06:42.568
Well, turns out that Bill Randolph
had quite the temper.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.989
He's got two counts of spousal battery,
bar brawls...

06:47.156 --> 06:49.992
...and court-ordered
anger-management sessions.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.538
You might say you wouldn't like him
when he's angry.

06:54.705 --> 06:59.460
So a hothead getting killed
by TV's greatest hothead.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.587
Kind of sounds like just desserts,
doesn't it?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.422
Hm.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.884
- It's all starting to make sense.
- How is it starting to make sense?

07:07.051 --> 07:10.304
Well, I found something else
at the crime scene.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.098
Candy wrappers.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.643
Lots of them.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.189
Just desserts, sweet tooth...

07:20.565 --> 07:22.859
...screwing with people
before you kill them.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.528
We're dealing with the Trickster,
aren't we?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.280
Sure looks like.

07:27.572 --> 07:31.784
Good. Been wanting to gank that mother
since the Mystery Spot.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.704
You sure?

07:34.954 --> 07:35.997
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:36.455 --> 07:39.167
No, I mean,
are you sure you wanna kill him?

07:39.333 --> 07:42.753
Son of a bitch didn't think twice
about icing me a thousand times.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.338
No, I mean, I'm just saying.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.341
What are you saying?
You don't wanna kill him, then what?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.679
- Talk to him.
- What?

07:52.763 --> 07:54.098
Look, think about it, Dean.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.226
He's one of the most powerful creatures
we've ever met.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.395
- Maybe we can use him.
- For what?

08:00.354 --> 08:02.899
Okay, Trickster's like
a Hugh Hefner type, right?

08:03.065 --> 08:06.235
Wine, women, song.
Maybe he doesn't want the party to end.

08:06.402 --> 08:09.322
Maybe he hates this angels-and-demons
stuff as much as we do.

08:09.488 --> 08:10.531
Maybe he'll help us.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.742
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.118
Ally with the Trickster?

08:14.952 --> 08:15.995
Yeah.

08:16.704 --> 08:20.458
A bloody, violent monster...

08:20.625 --> 08:22.877
...and you wanna be Facebook friends
with him?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.212
Nice, Sammy.

08:24.378 --> 08:28.049
The world is gonna end, Dean. We don't
have the luxury of a moral stand.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.551
I'm just saying it's worth a shot.
That's all.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.678
If it doesn't work...

08:32.929 --> 08:34.388
...we'll kill him.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.726
How are we gonna find the guy?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.479
Well, he never takes just one victim,
right?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.313
He'll show.

08:50.571 --> 08:56.244
<i>Dispatch? I got a possible 187
out here at the old paper mill on Route 6.</i>

08:56.410 --> 08:57.870
<i>- Hey.
- Roger that.</i>

08:58.037 --> 08:59.664
<i>What are you looking at there?</i>

08:59.831 --> 09:03.751

09:09.340 --> 09:12.552
- That sounds weird.
- Weird enough to be our guy?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.520
There was a murder here.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.730
And there's no police cars,
there's nobody.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.777
- How does that look to you?
- Crappy.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.214

10:10.943 --> 10:12.570

- Seriously?

10:12.737 --> 10:15.323
Seriously?
You're brilliant, you know that?

10:15.489 --> 10:18.034
And a coward.
You're a brilliant coward.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.078
Uh... What are you talking about?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.415

10:27.168 --> 10:29.003
I don't believe this.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.672
- What?
- That was Dr. Piccolo.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.257
Who?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.635
Dr. Ellen Piccolo.

10:35.801 --> 10:40.014
The sexy yet earnest doctor at...

10:42.808 --> 10:45.269
Seattle Mercy Hospital.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.272
Uh, Dean.

10:48.689 --> 10:52.860
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The doctor get-ups. The sexy interns.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.613
The "seriouslys."
It all makes sense.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.825
<i>- What makes sense? What's going on?
- We're in Dr. Sexy, M.D.</i>

11:11.462 --> 11:13.130
- Dude, what the hell?
- I don't know.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.508
- No, seriously. What the hell?
- I don't know.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.677
One theory. Any theory.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.764
- Uh, the Trickster trapped us in TV Land?
- That's your theory? That's stupid.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.225
<i>You're the one who said
we're on Dr. Sexy, M.D.</i>

11:24.392 --> 11:26.143
Yeah, but TV Land isn't TV Land.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.355
There's actors and lights
and crew members. This looks real.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.525
It can't be.
Dean, how can this possibly be real?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.319
I don't know, all right?

11:35.486 --> 11:38.281
- Doctors.
- But there goes Dr. Wang...

11:38.447 --> 11:41.784
...the sexy but arrogant heart surgeon.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.745
And there's Johnny Drake.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.666
Oh, he's not even alive.
He's a ghost in the mind of...

11:49.917 --> 11:51.127
Of her.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.380
The sexy but neurotic doctor
over there.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.675
So this show has ghosts?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.427
Why?

11:59.927 --> 12:01.888
I don't know. It is compelling.

12:02.054 --> 12:06.684
- I thought you said weren't a fan.
- I'm not. I'm not.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.356
- Oh, boy.
- What?

12:12.773 --> 12:14.400
- It's him.
- Who?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.489
It's him. It's Dr. Sexy.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.579
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.915
Doctor.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.919
Doctor.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.839
You wanna give me one good reason
why you defied my direct order...

12:37.006 --> 12:40.218
...to do the experimental face transplant
on Mrs. Beale?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.640
- One reason?
- Mm.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.351
Sure.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.777
- You're not Dr. Sexy.
- You're crazy.

12:58.402 --> 13:02.532
Really? Because I swore
part of what makes Dr. Sexy sexy...

13:02.698 --> 13:06.327
...is the fact that he wears
cowboy boots, not tennis shoes.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.037
Yeah. You're not a fan.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.122
It's a guilty pleasure.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.626
- Call security.
- Yeah, go ahead, pal.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.045
See, we know what you are.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.680
You guys are getting better.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.473
Get us the hell out of here.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.725
Or what?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.855
Don't see your wooden stakes,
big guy.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.233
That was you on the police scanner,
right? And this is a trick.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.402
Hello?

13:39.569 --> 13:41.112
Trickster.

13:41.279 --> 13:45.074
Come on. I heard you two yahoos
were in town, how could I resist?

13:45.241 --> 13:49.245
- Where the hell are we?
- You like it? It's all homemade.

13:49.412 --> 13:53.207
My own sets, my own actors.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.461
- Call it my own little idiot box.
- How do we get out?

13:57.628 --> 14:00.756
That, my friend, is the $64 question.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.008
Whatever. We just...

14:02.175 --> 14:04.969
We need to talk to you.
We need your help.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.848
Hmm. Let me guess.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.017
You two muttonheads
broke the world...

14:11.184 --> 14:13.603
...and you want me
to sweep up your mess.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.690
Please. Just five minutes. Hear us out.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.735
Sure. Tell you what.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.988
Survive the next 24 hours, we'll talk.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.325
- Survive what?
- The game.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.118
What game?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.495
You're in it.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.124
- How do we play?
- You're playing it.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.043
What are the rules?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.841
Oh, son of a bitch.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.011
Dr. Sexy?

14:49.013 --> 14:51.098
Dr. Sexy?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.104
<i>Paging Dr. Sexy. Report to the ER.</i>

14:57.271 --> 15:00.316
Oh, by the way, talking with monsters?
Hell of a plan.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.985
Just... What do we do now?

15:03.152 --> 15:05.905
You know what I'm doing? Leaving.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.324
Lady, what the hell?

15:09.116 --> 15:13.412
- You are a brilliant, brilliant...
- Yeah, a coward, you already said that.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.540
But I got news for you.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.166
I am not a doctor.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.962
No. Don't say that.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.716
You are the finest cerebrovascular
neurosurgeon I have ever met...

15:26.425 --> 15:28.094
...and I have met plenty.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.056
So that girl died on your table.
It wasn't your fault.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.599
It wasn't anybody's fault.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.102
Sometimes people just die.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.314
I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.191
You're afraid.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.989
You're afraid to operate again
and you're afraid to love.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.328
Yeah, we're getting out of here.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.330
Hey, doctor.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.709
- Yes?
- My wife needs that face transplant.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.461
Okay, you know what, pal?

16:02.628 --> 16:06.340
None of this is real, okay?
And your wife doesn't need jack squat.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.426
Okay?

16:12.847 --> 16:14.140
Hey, doctor.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.938
- Real. It's real.
- No, no, no.

16:21.105 --> 16:25.109
No, no, no. Hey! We need a doctor!

16:38.080 --> 16:40.208
BP's 80/50 and dropping.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.925
Doctor?

16:51.093 --> 16:52.637
What?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.101
Sam, do something. Come on.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.104
I don't know how to use
any of this crap.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.190
Figure it out.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.029
Sam. Come on, I'm waiting.

17:10.445 --> 17:13.406
Okay, um, I need...

17:14.200 --> 17:18.246
...a penknife, some dental floss,
a sewing needle...

17:19.372 --> 17:20.957
...and a fifth of whiskey.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.547
Stat!

17:36.722 --> 17:40.226
- We okay? How's it looking?
- Yup. You'll be fine.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.189
<i>I love you.</i>

18:12.925 --> 18:16.888
Let's play Nutcracker!

18:29.692 --> 18:32.111
Sam Winchester.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.289
- Count down.
- What? Uh...

18:43.456 --> 18:45.625
- What am I supposed to say?
- You think I know?

18:45.791 --> 18:48.544
Uh, I don't understand Japanese.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.515
Is he screwing with me?
I... I can't speak Japanese.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.351
Aww.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.650
Mmm.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.277
I'm sorry, Sam Winchester.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.531
Sorry? Heh. Sorry for what?

19:17.073 --> 19:18.366
Dean?

19:22.370 --> 19:23.996
Nutcracker!

19:31.128 --> 19:32.922
Nutcracker!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.552
- Sam?
- Yeah?

19:51.691 --> 19:52.984
You okay?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.245
Oh, now what?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.123
Cass?

20:08.666 --> 20:09.750
Is this another trick?

20:09.917 --> 20:13.713
- It's me. Uh, what are you doing here?
- Us? What are you doing here?

20:13.880 --> 20:17.383
- Looking for you. You've been missing.
- So get us the hell out of here then.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.593
Aww.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.802
Let's go.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.264
- Cass?
- No, no, no.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.437
Mr. Trickster does not like
pretty boy angels.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.990
Dean Winchester.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.502
- Count down.
- What do I do?

20:52.668 --> 20:56.923
- I don't wanna get hit in the nuts.
- I know. Uh, uh... Just, um... Wait.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.591
- What?
- I played a doctor.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.052
<i>- What?
- In Dr. Sexy, I played a doctor.</i>

21:01.219 --> 21:02.261
- I operated.
- So?

21:02.428 --> 21:05.598
I played the role the Trickster wanted.
We have to go along with it.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.517
- Go along with what?
- With the game.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.521
- You're on a game show. Just answer.
- In Japanese? I don't know Japanese.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.731
- Try.
- Damn it.

21:38.881 --> 21:42.718
Dean Winchester,
Nutcracker champion!

21:44.303 --> 21:47.139
- How did you do that?
- I have no idea.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.269
So that's it.
We play our roles, we survive.

21:51.894 --> 21:55.481
- Yeah, but play our roles for how long?
- Good question.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.289
I've got genital herpes.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.708
I've got genital herpes.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.504
Seriously?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.048
Hey, you're the one
who said play our roles, so...

22:21.215 --> 22:23.176
Yeah. Right.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.598
I've got genital herpes.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.516
I tried to be responsible.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.561
Did I try.

22:34.312 --> 22:40.735
But now I take twice-daily Herpexia
to reduce my chances of passing it on.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.821
Ask your doctor about using Herpexia.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.240
<i>Patients should
always consult with a physician...</i>

22:46.407 --> 22:47.909
<i>...before using Herpexia.</i>

22:48.075 --> 22:50.578
<i>Possible side effects
include headache, diarrhea...</i>

22:50.745 --> 22:54.874
<i>...permanent erectile dysfunction,
thoughts of suicide, and nausea.</i>

22:55.333 --> 23:00.546
I am doing all I can
to slightly lessen the spread of...

23:00.713 --> 23:04.634
Of... genital herpes.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.386
And that's a good thing.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.397
<i>We now return to Supernatural.</i>

23:18.940 --> 23:21.192
Son of a bitch.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.366
I am really, really very sorry...

23:28.908 --> 23:32.829
...but, ahem,
we've got some work to do.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.081
But we did do work.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.582
In depth.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.302
How long
do we have to keep doing this?

23:50.721 --> 23:52.306
I don't know.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.351
Maybe forever?

23:57.520 --> 23:58.604
We might die in here.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.234
How is that funny? Vultures.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.197
- You okay?
- I don't have much time.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.283
- What happened?
- I got out.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.910
- From where?
- Listen to me. Something is not right.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.246
This thing is more powerful
than it should be.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.165
- The Trickster?
- If it's a Trickster.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.916
What do you mean?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.086
Hello!

24:23.462 --> 24:24.755
Thank you.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.509
Thank you. Please, stop.

24:30.595 --> 24:31.846
Hi, Castiel.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.768
- You know him?
- Where did you just send him?

24:37.935 --> 24:39.729
Relax. He'll live.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.230
Maybe.

24:42.857 --> 24:46.819
All right, you know what? I'm done
with the monkey dance, okay? We get it.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.614
Yeah? Get what, hotshot?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.282
Playing our roles, right?

24:51.449 --> 24:53.409
- That's your game.
- That's half the game.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.579
- What's the other half?
- Play your roles out there.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.290
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know.

24:59.457 --> 25:03.753
Sam, starring as Lucifer.
Dean, starring as Michael.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.882
Your celebrity deathmatch.
Play your roles.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.343
You want us to say yes
to those sons of bitches?

25:10.510 --> 25:13.054
Hells, yeah. Let's light this candle.

25:13.221 --> 25:16.516
- We do that, the world will end.
- Yeah?

25:16.682 --> 25:20.102
And whose fault is that?

25:20.269 --> 25:24.148
Who popped Lucifer
out of the box, hm?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.359
Look, it's started.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.861
You started it. It can't be stopped.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.239
So let's get it over with.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.952
Heaven or hell. Which side you on?

25:36.619 --> 25:37.954
I'm not on either side.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.667
Yeah, right. You're grabbing ankle
for Michael or Lucifer. Which one is it?

25:44.794 --> 25:47.630
You listen to me, you arrogant dick.

25:47.797 --> 25:51.217
I don't work for either of those SOBs,
believe me.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.178
Mm. No, you're somebody's bitch.

25:57.598 --> 26:01.561
Don't you ever,
ever presume to know what I am.

26:08.943 --> 26:12.363
Now, listen very closely.
Here's what's gonna happen.

26:12.530 --> 26:15.992
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities...

26:16.159 --> 26:19.412
...and play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.913
And if we don't?

26:25.293 --> 26:28.796
Then you'll stay here in TV Land,
forever.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.720
Three hundred channels
and nothing's on.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.993
- Oh, come on.
- So, what do you think?

26:59.702 --> 27:02.955
What do I think? I think
go screw yourself, that's what I think.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.667
Uh, could you give us a sec, please?
Thanks.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.711
- You gotta calm down.
- Calm down?

27:08.878 --> 27:10.505
I am wearing sunglasses at night.

27:10.671 --> 27:14.592
You know who does that?
No-talent douche bags. I hate this game.

27:14.759 --> 27:17.595
I hate that we're in a procedural
cop show, wanna know why?

27:17.762 --> 27:20.264
Because I hate procedural cop shows.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.683
There's like 300 of them.
They're all the same.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.060
It's, "Ooh...

27:24.227 --> 27:25.895
...plane crashed here."
Oh, shut up.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.271
- Hey.
- What?

27:28.356 --> 27:30.816
Check out sweet tooth over there.

27:33.528 --> 27:35.279
You think that's him?

27:36.948 --> 27:40.034
Just, uh, follow my lead.

27:56.384 --> 28:00.012
- You, uh... You okay?
- Yeah.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.430
What do we got?

28:03.057 --> 28:06.727
Well, aside from the ligature marks
around his neck...

28:06.894 --> 28:10.982
...he has what appears to be a roll
of quarters jammed down his throat.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.487
Well, I say...

28:17.238 --> 28:18.281
...jackpot.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.116
Mm.

28:20.283 --> 28:24.078
Also, there is a stab wound
to the lower abdomen there.

28:33.838 --> 28:36.132
Well, I say...

28:37.925 --> 28:39.677
...no guts, no glory.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.306
Get that guy a...

28:44.807 --> 28:45.850
...TUMS.

28:49.187 --> 28:50.521
Gutter ball.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.358
Good one, guys.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.224
- You got the wrong guy, idiot.
- Did we?

29:58.464 --> 30:02.218
I'm worried, man.
What that SOB did to Cass.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.470
You know, where is he?

30:06.556 --> 30:08.182
Sam?

30:10.685 --> 30:12.395
Where are you?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.650
<i>It's Sam. Leave me a message.</i>

30:17.817 --> 30:20.695
Sam, it's me.

30:21.195 --> 30:23.281
Where the hell did you go?

30:23.906 --> 30:25.116
Dean?

30:27.326 --> 30:28.953
Sam?

30:30.413 --> 30:31.831
Where are you?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.708
I don't know.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.251
Oh, crap.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.046
I don't think we killed the Trickster.

30:59.483 --> 31:02.528
Okay, stake didn't work.
So, what, this another trick?

31:02.695 --> 31:03.779
I don't know.

31:03.946 --> 31:06.782
Maybe the stake didn't work
because it's not a Trickster.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.784
- What do you mean?
- You heard Cass.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.621
He said this thing was too powerful
to be a Trickster.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.332
Notice the way he looked at Cass?
Like he knew him.

31:14.499 --> 31:17.585
And how pissed he got when
you brought up Michael and Lucifer.

31:18.586 --> 31:19.795
Son of a bitch.

31:19.962 --> 31:23.007
- What?
- I think I know what we're dealing with.

31:34.477 --> 31:36.062
- Dean?
- What?

31:36.229 --> 31:39.065
That, uh, feels really uncomfortable.

31:41.234 --> 31:42.985
Ow.

31:43.236 --> 31:45.154
Are you sure this is gonna work?

31:45.321 --> 31:47.031
No, but I have no other ideas.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.248
All right, you son of a bitch!

31:56.082 --> 31:58.000
Uncle!

31:59.627 --> 32:01.504
We'll do it!

32:02.797 --> 32:03.881
Should I honk?

32:05.883 --> 32:08.094
Wow, Sam...

32:08.261 --> 32:10.513
...get a load of the rims on you.
- Eat me.

32:12.390 --> 32:14.559
Okay, boys.

32:15.142 --> 32:18.062
- Ready to go quietly?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.

32:19.397 --> 32:22.358
Nobody's going anywhere
until Sam has opposable thumbs.

32:22.525 --> 32:26.863
What's the difference? Satan's gonna
ride his ass one way or another.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.084
Happy?

32:41.794 --> 32:44.463
Tell me one thing.
Why didn't the stake kill you?

32:46.340 --> 32:49.177
- I am the Trickster.
- Or maybe you're not.

32:57.310 --> 32:59.395
Maybe you've always been an angel.

32:59.729 --> 33:02.481
Ha-ha-ha. A what?

33:02.690 --> 33:04.984
Somebody slip a mickey
in your power shake, kid?

33:05.151 --> 33:06.611
I'll tell you what.

33:06.777 --> 33:11.574
You just jump out of the holy fire
and we'll call it our mistake.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.005
Well played, boys.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.673
Well played.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.260
Where'd you get the holy oil?

33:31.802 --> 33:34.305
Well, you might say
we pulled it out of Sam's ass.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.310
- Where'd I screw up?
- You didn't.

33:39.477 --> 33:41.771
But nobody gets the jump on Cass
like you did.

33:41.938 --> 33:44.899
Mostly, it was the way you talked
about Armageddon.

33:45.066 --> 33:49.070
- Meaning?
- Well, call it personal experience.

33:49.237 --> 33:52.573
Nobody gets that angry unless
they're talking about their own family.

33:54.909 --> 33:58.538
So which one are you?
Grumpy, Sneezy or Douchey?

34:01.958 --> 34:04.460
Gabriel, okay?

34:05.503 --> 34:07.338
They call me Gabriel.

34:07.797 --> 34:11.175
Gabriel? The archangel?

34:11.342 --> 34:12.969
Guilty.

34:13.678 --> 34:17.014
Okay, Gabriel. How does an archangel
become a Trickster?

34:17.723 --> 34:20.101
My own private witness protection.

34:21.018 --> 34:24.188
I skipped out of heaven,
had a face transplant...

34:24.355 --> 34:26.732
...carved out my own little corner
of the world...

34:26.899 --> 34:29.277
...till you two screwed it all up.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.862
What did Daddy say
when you joined the pagans?

34:32.029 --> 34:35.032
Daddy doesn't say anything
about anything.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.243
Then what happened?
Why'd you ditch?

34:37.409 --> 34:41.664
Well, do you blame him? His brothers
are heavyweight douche nozzles.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.040
Shut your cake hole.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.127
You don't know anything
about my family.

34:46.293 --> 34:49.922
I loved my father, my brothers.

34:50.089 --> 34:53.342
Loved them,
but watching them turn on each other...

34:53.509 --> 34:55.094
...tear at each other's throats?

34:55.428 --> 34:58.347
I couldn't bear it, okay?

34:58.514 --> 35:00.224
So I left.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.853
And now it's happening all over again.

35:04.020 --> 35:05.062
Then help us stop it.

35:06.189 --> 35:07.732
It can't be stopped.

35:07.899 --> 35:11.444
- You wanna see the end of the world?
- I want it to be over.

35:12.111 --> 35:16.240
I have to sit back and watch my own
brothers kill each other, thanks to you.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.577
Heaven, hell, I don't care who wins.

35:19.744 --> 35:23.456
- I just want it to be over.
- It doesn't have to be like that.

35:23.623 --> 35:25.958
There has to be some way
to pull the plug.

35:27.668 --> 35:30.296
You do not know my family.

35:30.463 --> 35:35.384
What you guys call the apocalypse,
I used to call Sunday dinner.

35:35.551 --> 35:39.597
That's why there's no stopping this,
because this isn't about a war.

35:39.764 --> 35:44.936
It's about two brothers that loved
each other and betrayed each other.

35:45.102 --> 35:47.522
You think you'd be able to relate.

35:48.147 --> 35:50.024
What are you talking about?

35:55.363 --> 35:58.241
You sorry sons of bitches.

35:58.407 --> 36:01.953
Why do you think you two
are the vessels?

36:02.537 --> 36:03.913
Think about it.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.459
Michael, the big brother,
loyal to an absent father.

36:09.460 --> 36:15.883
And Lucifer, the little brother,
rebellious of Daddy's plan.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.595
You were born to this, boys.

36:19.887 --> 36:23.099
It's your destiny. It was always you.

36:24.517 --> 36:30.147
As it is in heaven,
so it must be on Earth.

36:30.523 --> 36:33.067
One brother has to kill the other.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.652
What the hell are you saying?

36:35.111 --> 36:38.739
Why do you think I've always taken
such an interest in you?

36:39.657 --> 36:43.828
Because from the moment
Dad flipped on the lights around here...

36:43.995 --> 36:47.957
...we knew it was all gonna end
with you.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.585
Always.

36:58.301 --> 36:59.635
No.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.598
That's not gonna happen.

37:04.015 --> 37:06.017
I'm sorry...

37:06.434 --> 37:07.643
...but it is.

37:16.194 --> 37:19.947
Guys, I wish this were a TV show.

37:20.114 --> 37:23.868
Easy answers,
endings wrapped up in a bow.

37:27.121 --> 37:29.290
But this is real.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.211
And it's gonna end bloody
for all of us.

37:35.046 --> 37:37.882
That's just how it's gotta be.

37:50.770 --> 37:54.732
So, boys, now what?

37:54.899 --> 37:58.152
Stare at each other
for the rest of eternity?

37:59.612 --> 38:03.115
First, you're gonna bring Cass
back from wherever you stashed him.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.493
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.954
Or we're going to dunk you
in some holy oil...

38:08.120 --> 38:10.331
...and deep-fry ourselves an archangel.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.928
Cass, you okay?

38:24.387 --> 38:26.389
I'm fine.

38:29.267 --> 38:30.393
Hello, Gabriel.

38:31.352 --> 38:32.979
Hey, bro.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.231
How's the search for Daddy going?

38:35.398 --> 38:37.316
Let me guess. Awful.

38:45.074 --> 38:46.409
Okay, we're out of here.

38:48.411 --> 38:49.996
Come on, Sam.

38:50.163 --> 38:53.875
Uh, okay.

38:54.917 --> 38:59.338
Guys? So... So, what? Huh?

38:59.547 --> 39:02.508
You're just gonna...
You're gonna leave me here forever?

39:04.969 --> 39:06.637
No.

39:06.971 --> 39:11.058
We're not, because we don't
screw with people the way you do.

39:12.143 --> 39:14.270
And for the record...

39:14.437 --> 39:17.607
...this isn't about some prizefight
between your brothers.

39:18.107 --> 39:20.735
Or some destiny
that can't be stopped.

39:20.902 --> 39:24.655
This is about you being too afraid
to stand up to your family.

39:48.638 --> 39:50.765
Don't say I never did anything for you.

40:09.784 --> 40:13.454
All that stuff he was spouting in there,
you think he was telling the truth?

40:13.955 --> 40:16.123
I think he believes it.

40:17.542 --> 40:19.502
So, what do we do?

40:21.420 --> 40:22.463
I don't know.

40:24.131 --> 40:28.010
I'll tell you one thing, right about now,
I wish I was back on a TV show.

40:29.220 --> 40:31.013
Yeah, me too.
