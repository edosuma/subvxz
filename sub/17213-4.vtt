00:16.642 --> 00:19.436
I'm starting to think
whoever they're buying from

00:19.520 --> 00:21.772
ain't gonna show.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.399
It's all about patience.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.735
That's what you said
in the Jonas Walker case...

00:27.611 --> 00:29.655
and he fell off the face of the Earth.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.616
You'll have to let
that one go, partner.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.535
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.870
I'm like a dog with a bone, I guess.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.914
Hello.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.187
What are they selling, car parts?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.689
Looks good.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.575
That's a hell of a lot of money
for car parts.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.293
Multiple shots fired!
65 Heward Drive.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.503
We need backup right away!

01:32.718 --> 01:34.344
- What about the backup?
- Can't wait!

01:39.642 --> 01:41.309
-FBI!
-Drop your weapons!

01:41.393 --> 01:43.061
No! Drop your weapons!

01:45.022 --> 01:47.691
All responding units, be advised,
there's a damaged Mercedes

01:47.775 --> 01:49.026
leaving this location
with three armed men,

01:49.109 --> 01:50.736
two of them badly injured.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.404
Intercept and detain if possible!

01:57.618 --> 01:59.202
Traveler...

01:59.286 --> 02:01.789
3468.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.165
Support required.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.209
47 degrees, 14 minutes,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.962
35.045 seconds.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.548
<i>Make and model confirmed.</i>
<i>Units are en route.</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:13.634
...07 seconds.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.803
End of message.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.558
You wait for the backup.
I'm going after them!

02:23.268 --> 02:24.561
It's a damn mess.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.461
<i>Philip, you there?</i>

02:49.544 --> 02:50.796
Hey, boss.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.214
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

02:52.297 --> 02:55.884
Oh, you know...
healing from a gunshot wound,

02:55.968 --> 02:57.720
watching old news with Marcy.

02:57.803 --> 03:02.390
I need you to direct me
to 47 degrees, 14 minutes,

03:02.474 --> 03:06.979
<i>35.045 seconds by 122 degrees,</i>

03:07.062 --> 03:10.315
22 minutes, 13.407 seconds.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.900
-You got it?
-On it.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.110
Why? What... What's happening?

03:13.193 --> 03:15.403
I just got the most bizarre messenger.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.530
They're all bizarre to me.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.283
No. This message came
from the mouth of a dying man.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.828
A traveler team in need of assistance
at those coordinates.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.247
It's on its way to you now.
We'll meet you there.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.332
Uh, nope. Philip's not going anywhere
in his shape,

03:27.415 --> 03:28.751
but I will be there in 10.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.878
<i>Pick up Carly on the way.</i>
<i>Come armed.</i>

03:30.961 --> 03:33.421
Bring your full medical kit.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.310
<i>You're at the coordinates.</i>

03:47.394 --> 03:49.772
<i>Should be an old warehouse on your left.</i>

03:49.855 --> 03:51.774
How far out
are Carly and Marcy?

03:51.857 --> 03:52.983
<i>Uh, five minutes.</i>

03:53.066 --> 03:55.693
Make sure
they wait for my all clear.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.320
<i>Understood.</i>

05:01.384 --> 05:02.635
Drop your weapon.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.139
-I'm here to help.
-Shut up.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.933
He's one of the FBI agents.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.142
Yeah. Who you shot at.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.311
Thanks very much.
Whatever happened to Protocol 3?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148
I'm Traveler 3468.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.692
I received a message
to come to these coordinates

05:17.775 --> 05:19.236
and give support.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.570
Who delivered the message?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.030
One of the Russians.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.074
Well, that's bullshit,
'cause that would kill an adult.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.242
It did.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.452
The director must've figured
he was dying anyway.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.914
You want my help or not?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.752
I'm Rick Hall. This is Carter.
That's my boy Luca on the table.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.545
Grant MacLaren.
My medic's on the way.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.631
Well, that's good,
'cause ours is dead.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.049
What is this? What happened?

05:41.133 --> 05:44.469
Well, our mission was to acquire
a component from Russian travelers

05:44.552 --> 05:46.513
and deliver it to
another team for testing.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.432
The Russians' historian was dead,
so they were out of cash.

05:49.516 --> 05:53.395
We were then instructed to finance them
in exchange for the handoff,

05:53.478 --> 05:54.854
but they got greedy.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.564
A traveler team turned on you?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.066
He must be new.

05:59.734 --> 06:00.735
Yeah. They went rogue.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.405
Tried to take our money and the component,
probably sell it somewhere else,

06:03.488 --> 06:05.448
and busted it in the process.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.202
You saw the rest.
Now where's the medic?

06:09.286 --> 06:12.872
Carly, Marcy, you have the all clear
to enter the building upon arrival.

06:12.956 --> 06:13.999
<i>One minute out.</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:16.793
They're moments away.
So how badly damaged is it?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.212
I don't know.
It's not my expertise.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.840
It was a good plan,
if the Russians hadn't gone rogue.

06:22.925 --> 06:26.053
Yeah, then the FBI would've busted you.
Doesn't sound like a great plan to me.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.434
Oh, shit.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.480
<i>We're coming in.</i>

06:39.107 --> 06:40.275
It's all right.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.734
What can you tell me?

06:41.818 --> 06:44.154
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
There's no exit wound.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.198
This is Luca. That's Carter. I'm Hall.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.033
Mr. Hall is their team leader.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.577
You can put your weapon
away now.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.833
He's lost a lot of blood
and he's still hemorrhaging.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.919
I think the only thing I can do is get him
stable before we get him to a hospital.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.214
No. No hospitals.
He's wanted by the police. They both are.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.674
Well, I don't have anywhere near
the proper resources.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.009
Well, obviously,
the director thinks you do,

07:06.093 --> 07:08.011
or you wouldn't be here, would ya?

07:11.264 --> 07:14.101
All right.
Go ahead and put him out.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.563
Can you get me light, please?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.155
All right. All right.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.699
Okay, warm up the laser
and get him on plasma.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.954
What happened?

07:34.037 --> 07:38.125
-He got shot in the gut.
-No, I'm talking about you. Let me see.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.046
Ah! God damn it!

07:43.130 --> 07:46.758
I don't think that you understand
how serious your injuries are.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.844
Stop worrying about me and help Luca.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.021
It's Forbes.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.230
Do your thing.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.149
MacLaren.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.443
We've got three dead bodies.
All of them ghosts in the system.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.696
Really? Any word on the whereabouts
of that car that I was pursuing?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.448
That's what I'm calling you to ask.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.034
No, no. They had too big a lead,

08:12.117 --> 08:14.619
and I was just about to get back
to local enforcement.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.371
All right. Let me know what you hear.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.081
Will do.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.957
I can't locate the bullet.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.085
I think the only thing that
I can do is cauterize the torn--

08:22.169 --> 08:23.170
Just get the bullet out of him.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.839
I am telling you
that if I operate now, I will kill him.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.267
Your friend Carter is coughing up blood

08:37.350 --> 08:39.811
because his internal bleeding
includes his lungs.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.605
I'm telling you that he's dying,
he can't be saved.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.316
Fuck off!
The man is an ox!

08:44.399 --> 08:47.902
Shut up and listen to me! Okay?
This is time-sensitive.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.280
Luca has lost close to 40% of his blood.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.241
He won't survive
any sort of surgery without a donor.

08:53.325 --> 08:57.037
So if we act now, we can use
Carter's blood to save Luca's life.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.040
I have a blood-type converter.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.958
I'm telling you I can't save them both.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.588
So we either watch the two of them die,
or Carter saves Luca's life.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.631
Those are your options.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.469
You need to decide
before Carter goes septic

09:12.552 --> 09:14.262
and his blood's not good to anyone.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.145
-Mr. Hall--
-I hear you. Relax.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.856
I just--
Just give me a second, please.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.579
I have to make sure
the FBI doesn't show up here.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.123
If I don't do something
to throw Forbes off--

09:41.206 --> 09:42.582
Do what you need to do.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.211
I'll be operating
into the early hours.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.462
Carly can assist.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.215
Mr. Hall can handle
anything that comes up.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.598
All right.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.418
Looking good, Trev.
How's it feel?

10:26.501 --> 10:27.544
I feel great.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.670
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.880
Let's see what else
you got in the tank!

10:35.427 --> 10:36.553
Wow.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.514
Man, you're flying!

10:39.597 --> 10:40.932
Back on the team in no time.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.435
Trevor. Can I talk to you?

10:43.518 --> 10:46.521
Ms. Day? How can I help you?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.357
Actually, I would like to help you.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.108
I've been looking over your transcripts,

10:51.193 --> 10:53.945
and there's some things
we need to talk about.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.322
What is it?

10:55.405 --> 10:57.324
Well, it's kind of a bigger conversation

10:57.407 --> 10:59.784
that I'd like to have
with you and your parents.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.161
You know, the whole team.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.121
I like to think that I can have
these conversations on my own.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.585
Well, you're 17, so...

11:08.668 --> 11:11.546
I've set a meeting with them
for fourth period today.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.506
I'll expect to see you there.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.800
I'll be there.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.261
- All right.
- Hey! A little help?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.392
Let's see if you've still got it!

11:49.709 --> 11:51.085
What are you doing here?

11:51.168 --> 11:52.962
No, "Hey, Jeff"?
No, "Good morning"?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.715
I get, "What are you doing here?"

11:55.798 --> 11:57.842
Looks like my son spent
another night at the babysitter

11:57.925 --> 12:00.678
while you're out
with your new man, hmm?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.054
Think I haven't seen
that white dude around?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.391
Is that how you got these new wheels?
You got a sugar daddy?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.018
That's none of your business.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.978
Carly. We gotta talk about this family.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.187
We're not a family.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.815
Mother, father, and son.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.403
Mother, son, abusive biological father.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.821
-That's cold.
-It's accurate.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.740
So you're gonna throw away
everything that's good between us

12:20.823 --> 12:23.493
because one night
I had a bit too much to drink?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.119
-Hmm?
-I'm leaving now.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.371
Carly, come on.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.623
Come on. You know
we got a connection, right?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.375
You gonna tell me you don't miss this?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.918
-Don't, Jeff.
-I do.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.299
Ow!

12:37.382 --> 12:40.427
What the...

12:43.971 --> 12:49.811
This... is where any idea you have
of us ends. Right now.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.022
You do not touch me.
Are we clear?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.859
I still got a right to see my kid.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.448
And your kid has a right to child support.
Don't come near us again without it.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.909
You've changed, Carly. You're like...

13:04.992 --> 13:07.579
You're like a completely different person.

13:07.662 --> 13:11.248
It's something that should've happened
a long time ago.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.418
Bitch.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.379
Bitch!

13:25.388 --> 13:26.889
Hey, kid?

13:26.973 --> 13:27.974
Hey.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.352
Got your drugs.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.811
Why don't you knock next time?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.940
Why don't you lock the door?
You're welcome, by the way.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.317
If you're smart, there's about
three weeks' worth of Percs in there.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.236
Although, you know, uh,

13:40.319 --> 13:43.030
trading one addiction for another
never works.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.870
Uh, you look, uh... not so good.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.872
Like somebody beat you up.
Somebody beat you up?

13:52.749 --> 13:53.583
I'm fine.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.085
You don't look fine.
You look like a piece of...

13:56.168 --> 13:57.294
Holy shit.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.841
What is this?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.551
It's nothing.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.428
It's insanity.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.519
Hey. It's the gambling matrix, right?
This is how you do it, isn't it?

14:12.602 --> 14:13.853
It's really nothing.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.732
There are dates up here
that are months from now.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.442
How much research do you--

14:19.526 --> 14:23.363
- No! Don't!
- Don't.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.699
Why don't you give me a tip?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.242
Gimme a little tip. Come on.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.872
Can you just leave? Please?

14:34.331 --> 14:35.792
Either you give me a tip,

14:35.875 --> 14:38.670
or you tell me what this is all about
on the wall over here.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.004
All right?

14:40.087 --> 14:43.841
'Cause you got all of that,
and you're giving me, like, crumbs.

14:45.427 --> 14:50.306
Come on, man. You'd be in jail right now
if it wasn't for me. You know that.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.176
Hey, Luca, it's okay!
Hey, hey, I'm right here.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.302
I'm right here.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.512
I need you to wake up. Listen to me.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.264
I need you to wake up, all right?
Wake up, Luca.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.475
-Luca? Luca, wake up.
-No. No.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.814
Get out!

15:39.897 --> 15:41.398
No! No!

15:41.483 --> 15:42.942
Wake up, Luca!

15:43.025 --> 15:44.819
Wake up!

15:53.285 --> 15:55.204
Ms. Warton.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.999
I'm Officer Conniker.
I tried to contact you earlier.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.628
I'd just like to speak with you
about the incident outside the library.

16:01.711 --> 16:02.837
What incident?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.798
The boys that assaulted you
and another employee?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.385
Listen, I understand
that you didn't report it,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.054
and that's not unusual
with assault cases, but I...

16:12.138 --> 16:14.516
I saw the closed-circuit
television footage.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.143
Caught both assaults
and you kicking their asses.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.103
Not that you'd be
in any trouble for retaliating.

16:19.186 --> 16:22.231
What I saw was actually...
damn impressive.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.983
Well, I'd like to move on.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.612
Uh-huh. Listen,
have you sought counseling of any kind?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.782
Everything's fine.
I don't need counseling.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.784
So then why are you living
with your social worker?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.118
Excuse me?

16:34.201 --> 16:37.580
Not that you're to blame in any way,
but I should inform you

16:37.664 --> 16:40.332
that should a state mental health worker
be found guilty

16:40.416 --> 16:42.251
of inappropriate fraternization
with a client,

16:42.334 --> 16:44.211
especially one with developmental issues--

16:44.295 --> 16:46.589
Do I look like I have
developmental issues, Officer?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.465
That's not for me to judge.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.676
I'm just saying

16:49.759 --> 16:53.179
that'd be grounds for termination.
If not worse, litigation.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.517
Just so you understand the consequences.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.352
Are you gonna take that, or...

17:00.436 --> 17:02.730
Uh, yeah. If you'll excuse me.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.899
This is Marcy.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.367
What happened?
He was fine when I left.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.578
Night terrors.

17:18.580 --> 17:19.914
Sometimes they're too real.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.249
Yeah, one minute he's sleeping,
the next, he's screaming.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.500
He almost killed me once.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.712
Move.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.634
All right, well,
let's get you closed up again.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.896
-Mac. We got 'em.
-Got who?

17:43.980 --> 17:45.397
Our friends from last night.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.399
Located 'em right here in town.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.027
We had leads had them leaving the city.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.279
Yeah, I did some digging anyway.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.032
Ran the plates on the car
that left the scene.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.784
Belongs to a Sergeant Rick Hall.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.370
Served in Iraq. Lives in Portland.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.789
Had some agents go check out
his place this morning.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.375
Hall hasn't been there in weeks.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.169
Pulled him up on the database.
He owns three other properties.

18:07.253 --> 18:12.634
Place in Austin, condo in Vancouver,
and a warehouse right here in town.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.138
Checked out the freeway CCTV footage...

18:18.305 --> 18:19.766
and...

18:19.849 --> 18:20.933
Nice work.

18:21.017 --> 18:24.395
Let's, uh, file for a warrant
and get down there, huh?

18:25.187 --> 18:27.607
Already got it. Suit up.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.442
Right. I'll meet you
downstairs in a minute.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.778
All right.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.072
Marcy, it's MacLaren.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.995
I don't know, man.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.499
I just got word from MacLaren.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.419
The FBI are on their way.
We have maybe 20 minutes.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.087
Isn't MacLaren with the FBI?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.173
Yeah, and he obfuscated
the best he could.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.091
But his partner found your name
on the deed to this building

18:54.175 --> 18:55.301
and tracked your vehicle here.

18:55.384 --> 18:59.055
Okay, well, you...
you tell him he's gotta stop them.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.099
There's only so much he can do
without blowing his cover.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.600
We're wasting time.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.186
Are you being serious right now?
Are you kidding me?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.354
What about us?
Luca shouldn't even be moved!

19:07.438 --> 19:08.856
I will be there!

19:08.940 --> 19:11.608
I'm okay. We should go.

19:11.693 --> 19:14.153
They're on their way. We need to move.

19:17.782 --> 19:18.991
What I'd like to do

19:19.075 --> 19:22.619
is change the conversation
from Trevor's football career

19:22.704 --> 19:24.455
and focus on his grades.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.666
If he has the football career,
he doesn't need grades.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.251
Tabling that for a moment,

19:29.335 --> 19:30.878
I think it's important
for you to understand

19:30.962 --> 19:33.130
that Trevor needs
to start doing much better...

19:33.214 --> 19:35.507
<i>Trevor,</i>
<i>we need you outside the school</i>

19:35.591 --> 19:37.176
<i>and ready to go in three minutes.</i>
<i>We've got a mission.</i>

19:37.259 --> 19:38.803
Are you prepared to do the work?

19:38.886 --> 19:40.805
- I can do that.
<i>- Good.</i>

19:40.888 --> 19:42.849
<i>Carly will be outside to pick you up.</i>

19:42.932 --> 19:44.892
...on his homework
and less watching Internet porn.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.561
- Understood. No more porn.
<i>- What?</i>

19:47.644 --> 19:49.063
Don't wanna embarrass the kid.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.522
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, Gary.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.607
Ms. Day?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.318
I know you probably have a lot you wanna
talk about without me in the room.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.528
So, I should give you a chance to do that.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.323
All I have to say
is that I fully intend to raise my grades,

19:59.406 --> 20:00.742
and focus on the sciences,

20:00.825 --> 20:02.659
and that I have no intention
of playing football again.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.370
-What?
-Sorry, Gary.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.454
Gary?

20:05.537 --> 20:06.873
Thank you for your time and concern.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.290
Wait, Trevor, we're not finished here.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.127
- Trevor!
- You're playing football!

20:12.628 --> 20:16.548
I'm sorry. He's just been so different
since the concussion.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.719
Can I have one of those?

20:22.972 --> 20:26.267
Do you think you can sit up for me?
Come on.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.435
All right. There you go.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.023
Okay.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.733
I need you to hold this bag
above your heart, okay?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.276
All right.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.529
Is that Carter?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.116
He saved your life.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.162
Above your heart, okay?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.081
Nice and easy.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.792
The wound is fragile.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.836
All right. It's time. We gotta go.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.337
Okay.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.976
Reminder,
these men are dangerous.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.602
Approach with extreme caution.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.942
Breathe, man. You used to love this shit
in the old days.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.945
I wasn't very bright in the old days.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.984
Fall back! Fall back!

22:00.444 --> 22:01.653
You okay?

22:12.456 --> 22:13.833
You should've warned us.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.292
Come on. You would have told them.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.668
MacLaren had to be
as surprised as the rest.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.837
Don't worry about it. They're fine.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.921
But they could be hurt.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.672
It had to be done!
We would've left too much back there--

22:22.341 --> 22:23.717
Jesus, what is that?
Is that a baby?

22:26.637 --> 22:27.763
Whose baby's that?

22:27.846 --> 22:29.473
- Mine.
- You take him on missions?

22:29.556 --> 22:30.933
Oh, not if I can help it,

22:31.017 --> 22:32.726
but somebody needed
to come save your ass.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.523
He has your eyes, Carly.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.525
He really does.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.455
I just hope we can fix it.
It's a key component.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.957
Tell me this kid knows what he's doing?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.918
This kid is older than all of us
put together.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.212
What the fuck was that?

23:00.296 --> 23:01.588
You nearly killed my men!

23:01.672 --> 23:02.756
They're not your men.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.217
Do you even give a damn
about Protocol 3?

23:05.301 --> 23:07.719
-Was anybody killed?
-You nearly killed me, Hall!

23:07.803 --> 23:09.221
Yet here you are, MacLaren!

23:09.305 --> 23:10.764
Look, if you had done your job properly,

23:10.847 --> 23:12.349
the FBI wouldn't have found us
in the first place.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.101
I can only throw them
off the scent for so long!

23:14.185 --> 23:15.561
Forbes is a good cop.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.272
Well, maybe I should've waited
for your friend Forbes to open the door

23:18.355 --> 23:20.857
-before I set it off.
-What?

23:20.942 --> 23:24.070
It was our base of operations.
I had to get rid of the evidence!

23:24.153 --> 23:26.948
-You almost got--
-Okay! Okay, okay.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.537
It's done. You're alive.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.206
Yeah.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.463
Have you slept?
You look exhausted.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.924
I am, but I'll live.
So will my patient.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.011
- It's not an easy fix.
- But we can do it.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.805
-Well, you damn well better.
-Don't talk to my team like that!

23:51.888 --> 23:53.182
Or what? What're you gonna do?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.934
Okay! All right! All right! Hey!

24:01.482 --> 24:04.526
They just need some time to work.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.489
Let's give them some space.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.039
What is it?

24:17.914 --> 24:19.083
I'm grounded.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.464
You know, I was tempted
to break his nose on your behalf, but...

24:25.547 --> 24:27.424
I held it together.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.343
You and me both.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.471
I don't know, the director obviously
thinks he and his team are worth saving,

24:32.554 --> 24:34.431
but I...

24:34.515 --> 24:35.891
I gotta get back to work.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.852
This bomb isn't exactly gonna
de-escalate the investigation.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.105
I gotta call my babysitter.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.165
Hey. Can I get on our computer?

24:59.248 --> 25:01.958
Uh... Is there something I can--

25:02.043 --> 25:03.960
I'll do it, just get me on.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.339
I need to set dropoff coordinates
with the other team,

25:07.423 --> 25:09.133
if that's okay with you.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.515
-Be my guest.
-Well, thank you so much.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.252
How you feeling, Luca?

25:47.045 --> 25:48.630
Better.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.383
Thanks.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.554
Hey, uh, how long
have you had night terrors?

25:57.514 --> 25:58.807
Since I was a kid.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.852
I know it's hard for some people
to understand.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.687
No. I do.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.483
My brother used to get them
all the time growing up.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.735
-Your brother?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.906
Uh, get some rest, okay?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.409
Yeah.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.632
Hey.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.178
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-About what?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.555
Well, when I was really young,
there was an emergency evacuation

26:38.639 --> 26:39.890
in my shelter block.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.809
-I was separated from my brother--
-So?

26:43.727 --> 26:46.813
So... one of the things
that I remember about him

26:46.897 --> 26:48.774
is he used to suffer from night terrors.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.901
I just thought,
there's only so many of us--

26:50.984 --> 26:53.487
Leave the future in the past, Doctor.
Protocol 2.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.906
I understand that,
but if it's at all possible--

26:55.989 --> 26:57.032
I don't think you understand.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.742
I don't think you understand
a goddamn thing.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.118
I don't think any of you do!

27:01.620 --> 27:05.832
Look. We came here
with a team of five, just like you.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.668
You know, we all made it.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.003
Which is rarer than you think,
believe it or not,

27:10.086 --> 27:11.838
but we're down to two now.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.800
What does that mean to you?

27:14.883 --> 27:17.010
Uh... two more to go?

27:18.970 --> 27:21.223
When you have been doing this
as long as we have,

27:21.307 --> 27:23.184
doing whatever the director tells you,
without question,

27:23.267 --> 27:25.811
building devices for missions,
rigging elections,

27:25.894 --> 27:27.479
saving people...

27:27.563 --> 27:30.274
and, by the way, killing people, too.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.402
Don't think the future doesn't get
its hands dirty.

27:35.696 --> 27:40.742
To do this job, to stay alive,
you need to be focused.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.411
We're very focused, Mr. Hall.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.122
Focused?
You're a bunch of fucking tourists!

27:46.207 --> 27:47.333
He's a junkie.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.793
Don't think I haven't seen
fresh track marks before.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.213
You're worried about
your parents grounding you,

27:52.296 --> 27:53.630
for Christ's sake!

27:53.714 --> 27:55.549
Your tactician brings an infant
to the missions,

27:55.632 --> 27:56.800
and MacLaren...

27:56.883 --> 27:58.719
MacLaren doesn't even know
what side he's on!

27:58.802 --> 28:01.054
Well, I thought we were all supposed
to be on the same side.

28:01.137 --> 28:05.016
I need you to be committed
to the mission, whatever the mission!

28:05.100 --> 28:09.813
Protocol 1 is the only one that matters,
and that's what you guys aren't getting.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.523
And you're not getting that
because your priorities

28:11.607 --> 28:13.484
are all outta fuckin' whack!

28:15.193 --> 28:18.029
Now, I need this team,
right here, right now,

28:18.113 --> 28:20.782
to get on side, or I cannot trust you.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.494
Is there a problem?

28:23.577 --> 28:25.329
- No!
- Yes!

28:25.412 --> 28:27.456
Mr. Hall here doesn't seem to think
we know what we're doing.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.416
I'm just trying to help
your people understand

28:29.500 --> 28:30.667
how things are around here.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.836
Oh, we understand how it is, Mr. Hall.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.881
We really do.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.716
I hope so.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.072
Knock knock?

29:01.156 --> 29:02.198
Kat.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.577
You really are here.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.454
Well, yeah, I... I texted you.

29:07.538 --> 29:10.916
Yes, you did. How romantic.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.793
Since this is usually date night,

29:12.876 --> 29:15.837
I thought I'd bring you some Chinese
and make you take a break.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.339
Don't worry, it's vegetarian.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.799
Well, that is romantic.

29:18.882 --> 29:19.883
Mmm.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.969
I'm sorry about tonight.
I... I know it's been crazy busy.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.514
-I just... We don't have enough manpower.
-Oh, come on.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.724
I am happy to share you
with your work, babe.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.768
I always have been.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.646
As long as that's all I'm competing with.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.940
What does that mean?

29:36.275 --> 29:40.153
Well, it has been an awfully long time.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.909
Yeah, I know.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.466
You still look like shit.

30:00.549 --> 30:01.967
Thanks.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.218
Who's that you're with?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.720
A friend.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.262
Well, it looks like a cop car.

30:06.347 --> 30:10.392
Yeah, it does a little, doesn't it?
So which one is it?

30:10.476 --> 30:12.227
Right here.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.524
That's great. Thanks for doing this.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.360
Yeah.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.236
-Keys?
-Oh...

30:21.320 --> 30:22.904
Where's my money?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.114
I transferred your money.

30:24.197 --> 30:28.410
Yeah, you transferred me the rent.
Now you owe me 8% commission.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.870
8% what?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.414
And, uh, bets for tomorrow?

30:32.498 --> 30:35.000
I gave you bets yesterday.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.461
Yeah, uh...
I got a little ambitious.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.254
I can't keep doing this, Ray.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.632
Well, I can't keep being your errand boy.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.634
Come on, bud.
Show me a little respect.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.636
Look at everything I do for you
on a daily basis.

30:45.719 --> 30:48.930
I bring you drugs.
I show you houses.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.933
You don't even tell me your system.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.019
Okay, 10%.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.564
10%.
What's that work out to be?

30:57.648 --> 30:59.065
Just give me the keys.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.067
Who's this house for, anyway?

31:01.151 --> 31:03.445
It's a safe house for time travelers.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.614
Them again, huh?

31:07.032 --> 31:09.951
All right. It's better I don't know.
Here you go.

31:11.828 --> 31:15.040
You know, in a way,
I'm kind of glad this happened.

31:15.123 --> 31:18.251
Glad you got shot? Why?

31:18.334 --> 31:20.462
Well, believe it or not,

31:20.546 --> 31:23.632
I'm the last member
of the team to take a hit.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.803
Everyone else has taken at least
one bullet for the director.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.098
I was starting to feel like maybe
I wasn't pulling my weight or something.

31:32.182 --> 31:36.478
Well, I've, uh, got the impression
Hall likes to make everyone feel that way.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.230
Ah, he might have
a harsh style of leadership,

31:39.314 --> 31:43.026
but... I'd do anything for that man.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.238
Your host have a family?

31:48.699 --> 31:50.241
Sort of. Not really.

31:50.325 --> 31:54.580
She had, um... David.
His name is David.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.165
He took care of my host
before I arrived.

31:57.248 --> 32:01.127
What? Like a butler?
Your host rich?

32:01.211 --> 32:04.798
No, she just needed assistance
with some things.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.094
What about you? Wife? Kids?

32:25.569 --> 32:26.653
That should do it.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.697
-Looks different.
-It'll work.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.493
Hall, we found you a safe house.
It's time to go.

32:32.576 --> 32:35.161
Don't let the door hit your ass
on the way out.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.747
What happened to
"we're all on the same side"?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.540
I don't wanna be in the same room.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.584
Listen, we're all gonna get along.
You'll see.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.794
- Where's Luca and Marcy?
- They went for a walk.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.672
Marcy said that he had to keep moving
to prevent clotting.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.215
Okay.
Soon as they get back.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.594
Are you sure
that's the director's intention?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.428
'Cause I'm just...
I'm just asking a question.

32:52.513 --> 32:55.056
Have you received instructions
from the director to relocate my team?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.141
No, I haven't.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.434
Okay. Well, the director put us together
for a reason.

32:58.519 --> 32:59.853
You're splitting us up, why?

32:59.936 --> 33:02.063
Protocol 6. Maybe--

33:02.147 --> 33:03.649
Oh, listen to the boy scout
quoting his protocols.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.400
I know the rules, MacLaren.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.319
"Traveler teams should stay apart
unless instructed otherwise."

33:08.403 --> 33:11.907
Well, guess what?
You were instructed otherwise.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.950
I think you know
that I have seniority here.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.286
I should be leading this team.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.628
MacLaren.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.797
We ID'd all the bodies now.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.676
Counting the Russians and the guy we found
scorched in the warehouse, that's four.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.302
That leaves two still out there.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.804
One of them's
this Rick Hall character.

33:33.887 --> 33:34.930
Who's the other one?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.557
<i>The system just pulled him up</i>

33:36.640 --> 33:40.393
<i>on a ABM camera in the east end.</i>
<i>I'll send a picture to your phone.</i>

33:40.476 --> 33:42.646
Guy's name is Luca Shun.

33:42.729 --> 33:46.608
<i>We got him working 15 years</i>
<i>as a sous chef in Portland.</i>

33:46.692 --> 33:50.696
Then all of a sudden he's wanted upstate
for petty theft and assault charges.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.739
I'm following a lead on Hall.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.616
- I'll let you know what I find.
<i>- A'ight.</i>

33:54.700 --> 33:56.201
Agent Forbes?

33:56.284 --> 33:57.703
I told you
he was a good cop.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.372
Marcy, I need you and Luca inside now.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.374
Marcy?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.210
She may have turned off her com.
I'll try and find them.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.253
- I'll look around the neighborhood.
- You stay put.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.922
-You're just as wanted as Luca.
-Hey. We're right here.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.632
Hey.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.301
-What's wrong?
-The FBI caught you on CCTV,

34:13.384 --> 34:14.886
knows who you are,
and are searching the area.

34:14.970 --> 34:17.180
Yeah, if only we had
somebody on the inside.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.349
There is no way
I'm risking my team

34:19.432 --> 34:20.976
getting discovered.
I want you out of here.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.061
The mission comes first.

34:23.144 --> 34:24.980
You said it was a simple handoff
of a component,

34:25.063 --> 34:27.523
so hand it off and get out of state.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.317
You know, there's a simple answer
to this problem.

34:32.403 --> 34:33.822
He needs to go.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.907
-Who needs to go?
-Go where?

34:35.991 --> 34:38.034
Forbes! He knows too much.
He's too close.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.703
We remove him,
we don't gotta go anywhere.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.329
We are not killing Forbes.

34:41.412 --> 34:43.498
Well, if you can't do it,
I know people who can,

34:43.582 --> 34:46.001
but it's obvious to me the director's
put us together for a reason,

34:46.084 --> 34:48.169
so I can teach you a lesson.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.548
Now, if it's too much for you to handle,
I can help you.

34:52.633 --> 34:54.175
But I think it would be
better for all of us

34:54.259 --> 34:56.011
to see if you have it in you.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.224
So...

35:01.307 --> 35:04.144
Do we...
Do we have a problem?

35:04.978 --> 35:05.979
No.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.231
Do you deny my seniority?

35:09.232 --> 35:11.567
-I don't deny it.
-Of course not.

35:11.652 --> 35:14.570
You're the kind of man
who follows the rules.

35:14.655 --> 35:15.864
This is great, right?

35:15.947 --> 35:18.324
Luca and I can handle our dropoff tonight
while you deal with Forbes.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.201
I'm gonna take your vehicle.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.037
- I'll rent you a car.
- Whatever.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.915
As long as you remember to bring it back
with a full tank of gas.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.124
Cracks me up. I love this guy.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.544
Here's the thing. When we're both done,
we are gonna have a conversation

35:29.628 --> 35:32.588
about how this new team
will work together.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.614
- <i>Forbes.</i>
- Hey, it's Mac.

35:58.699 --> 35:59.950
You got something?

36:00.033 --> 36:01.284
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:02.535
We should meet.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.329
I'll text you the location
and the broad strokes,

36:04.412 --> 36:06.539
but we should go over
the details in person.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.708
<i>Say an hour?</i>

36:07.791 --> 36:10.669
Yeah, I can do that. You all right?

36:11.795 --> 36:14.047
Never better.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.423
See you in an hour.

36:57.548 --> 36:58.717
We're all set.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.102
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.686
I know.

37:10.771 --> 37:14.232
But I never thought
we'd have to do something like this.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.861
Just think of how MacLaren feels.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.071
He's the one who has to do it.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.698
He doesn't have to do anything.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.534
The director didn't order it.

37:55.481 --> 37:58.068
How confident are you in the intel?

37:58.151 --> 38:00.779
This is the place. Come on.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.123
Your new doctor thinks she's your sister.

38:53.206 --> 38:56.334
Yeah. She told me. I hope she's right.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.837
Well, you should get that thought
out of your head right now.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.256
Your loyalty needs to be with me.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.466
You know you have it.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.430
-Not so sure of MacLaren.
-Oh, don't worry about MacLaren.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.933
I know what kind of guy he is.
He'll fall in line.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.269
And if he doesn't?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.729
Then he'll have to go.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.138
FBI!

39:50.221 --> 39:52.015
Hands! Show me your hands!

39:53.599 --> 39:55.977
Son of a bitch.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.605
Get out.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.069
Sergeant Richard Hall,
you have the right to remain silent.

40:04.152 --> 40:07.113
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.781
You have the right to an attorney.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.951
If you cannot afford one...

40:16.289 --> 40:17.916
Search the car.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.961
North and south are clear.

41:25.275 --> 41:27.693
Sorry for the change in location.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.280
What happened to the other team?

41:30.363 --> 41:33.199
They apparently had complications.
We were instructed to take over.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.576
Here it is.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.371
It was damaged...
but we did our best to repair it.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.748
So long as it works.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.625
Helios isn't far away.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.634
Wasn't anything in the car.

41:51.717 --> 41:52.927
No?

41:53.011 --> 41:55.305
It's cool. We got plenty on 'em
to put 'em away.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.681
Just makes me wonder...

41:58.516 --> 41:59.892
what were they doing out here?

41:59.975 --> 42:02.770
Well, how about
I ask 'em in the morning?

42:02.853 --> 42:04.897
That works for me. Great work, partner.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.482
You, too.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.567
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
<i>I know it's late.</i>

42:49.650 --> 42:54.530
<i>I just wanted to touch base</i>
<i>about what we did tonight.</i>

42:59.034 --> 43:04.207
<i>The last thing I ever thought I'd do</i>
<i>is turn on a fellow traveler...</i>

43:04.290 --> 43:06.959
<i>but I really don't think</i>
<i>we had any other choice.</i>

43:11.922 --> 43:16.469
<i>I guess we'll find out soon enough</i>
<i>if the director agrees.</i>

43:19.889 --> 43:21.599
Anyway...

43:21.682 --> 43:24.894
I just wanted to say
thanks for sticking by me.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.979
Get some rest.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.781
Can you stay?

43:37.990 --> 43:39.409
I shouldn't.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.372
Okay.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.624
Tell me we did the right thing.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.502
I believe we did.

43:51.379 --> 43:53.923
But I guess we'll see.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.926
Yeah. We'll see.
