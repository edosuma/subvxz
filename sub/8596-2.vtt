WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:03.713
We were born in space.

00:03.922 --> 00:06.299
They told us the ground
was uninhabited,

00:06.508 --> 00:08.301
but they were wrong,
and we've been fighting

00:08.510 --> 00:11.846
for our lives since
the moment we landed.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.516
Some of us have been
broken by it,

00:14.724 --> 00:16.476
but most of us are still here,

00:16.685 --> 00:18.895
searching for other survivors
from the ark,

00:19.104 --> 00:21.189
trying to build something
real and lasting

00:21.398 --> 00:23.608
out of the wilderness--a home.

00:23.817 --> 00:25.318
Our leaders believe
that to survive,

00:25.527 --> 00:28.113
we need to make peace
with the grounders,

00:28.321 --> 00:30.907
but peace
is a foreign concept here.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.036
I found it, John.
The city of light is real.

00:35.245 --> 00:37.122
I can tell you
about the city of light,

00:37.330 --> 00:39.541
but you won't understand until
you experience it yourself.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.001
I'm not going in.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.293
Just gonna remind me
of what I did

00:42.502 --> 00:43.545
to get them here.

00:43.753 --> 00:44.879
Yu Don Sin
Disha plan in?

00:45.088 --> 00:46.172
Clarke,
she's being hunted.

00:46.381 --> 00:47.674
- By who?
- By everyone.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.175
A tracking beacon
from the ark--farm station.

00:49.384 --> 00:51.511
- That's the beacon.
- This belongs to us.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.264
The ice nation queen
wants Clarke's power.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.849
If her people know she has it,

00:56.057 --> 00:58.393
she'll break the coalition
and start a war.

01:00.687 --> 01:03.648
It's been 3 hours.
What are they waiting for?

01:03.857 --> 01:05.859
Even with the light,
I don't see anyone.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.193
I say we make
a run for it.

01:07.402 --> 01:09.654
No. That's what
they want us to do.

01:09.863 --> 01:10.989
The boy
is right.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.782
They can wait
longer than we can.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.162
OK, Bellamy.

01:17.370 --> 01:18.872
Get in the turret,
and you cover us.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.498
Once we get to that
Ridge over there,

01:20.707 --> 01:21.958
we'll cover you.

01:22.167 --> 01:25.253
Copy that. Run fast.

01:32.969 --> 01:35.513
They're here.

01:35.722 --> 01:38.141
Everybody out,
or the boy dies.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.809
Ugh! Hey, hey!

01:40.018 --> 01:44.022
OK! OK.
We're coming out.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.608
Don't hurt him.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.742
Uh!

01:55.950 --> 01:57.035
Rrgh!

01:57.243 --> 01:59.204
Huh!

02:00.330 --> 02:02.207
All targets secure.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.380
Found it.

02:09.589 --> 02:11.299
It's mine.
Give it back!

02:11.508 --> 02:13.635
Monty, let it go.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.720
Monty?

02:19.974 --> 02:22.060
Mom?

02:56.302 --> 02:59.222
I still can't believe
how beautiful it is.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.890
It's perfect.

03:01.099 --> 03:02.308
In the city
of light,

03:02.517 --> 03:05.145
mankind will finally
be free of pain

03:05.353 --> 03:08.231
and hate and disease.

03:08.439 --> 03:11.609
Here, there will be
no more suffering.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.572
I'll fill
this place,

03:15.780 --> 03:18.575
starting with
my people.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.326
You have my word.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.704
I believe in you,
Thelonious.

03:23.663 --> 03:27.917
Together, we will
save the human race.

03:28.126 --> 03:31.671
Earth to Jaha.
Come in, Jaha.

03:34.799 --> 03:35.884
Yes, John?

03:36.092 --> 03:37.385
Hate to break up
your little zen nap,

03:37.594 --> 03:38.761
but we're here.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.180
- Already?
- Yeah.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.473
A lot faster
with a motor.

03:44.809 --> 03:47.437
Ungh!

03:47.645 --> 03:49.647
Easy.

03:49.856 --> 03:51.524
I was just
trying to help.

03:51.733 --> 03:54.694
As I recall,
the last time you helped,

03:54.903 --> 03:57.405
two of my friends
blew up.

03:57.614 --> 04:02.160
No minefield this time.
We go around the dead zone.

04:02.368 --> 04:03.828
Let's get
a move on, you two.

04:04.037 --> 04:05.330
Right behind you.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.832
We head west
towards that rise.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.792
You know, this
whole helpful guide act,

04:10.001 --> 04:13.004
I'm not really
buying it.

04:13.213 --> 04:15.048
Then I guess you're
just gonna have

04:15.256 --> 04:17.842
to keep an eye on me.

04:26.476 --> 04:27.352
Uh...

04:30.480 --> 04:32.190
Oh...

04:35.485 --> 04:37.695
I knew it.
Oh...

04:40.990 --> 04:43.576
Farm station,
stand down.

04:45.036 --> 04:47.288
Pike?

04:47.497 --> 04:50.250
You have no idea how
good it is to see you.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.710
- Oh...
- Ha ha ha!

04:52.919 --> 04:54.420
We didn't
think you made it.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.839
Lacroix, Smith,
watch our 6.

04:57.048 --> 05:00.718
Everyone else,
I said, stand down.

05:00.927 --> 05:02.220
Yes, sir.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.933
Where's dad?

05:09.894 --> 05:12.105
Father didn't make it.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.448
How many of you
are there?

05:22.657 --> 05:23.700
63.

05:23.908 --> 05:24.993
The rest are camped
in the mountains

05:25.201 --> 05:26.494
north of here,

05:26.703 --> 05:27.829
grounder killers
one and all.

05:27.996 --> 05:29.956
- Am I right?
- Ooh rah!

05:31.291 --> 05:33.334
Hate
to cut this short.

05:33.543 --> 05:34.711
We got to find Clarke.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.045
Clarke Griffin?

05:36.254 --> 05:38.589
Yeah. If only all of
my earth skills students

05:38.798 --> 05:39.757
were as good as her.

05:39.966 --> 05:40.925
It's good
to see you, sir.

05:41.134 --> 05:41.926
Yeah. You, too.

05:42.135 --> 05:43.136
OK. Move the tree.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.680
Help them.

05:45.888 --> 05:49.183
I'll be
right back.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.150
You OK?

05:57.358 --> 05:59.861
I have to be.

06:00.987 --> 06:03.823
Now come on. Push!

06:05.533 --> 06:08.202
63?

06:08.411 --> 06:11.664
Farm station left orbit
with 3 times that number.

06:11.873 --> 06:14.834
We landed with
that number, too.

06:15.043 --> 06:18.004
The ice nation
can be ruthless.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.424
Take pride
in the number you saved.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.093
Indra, this
is Charles pike.

06:24.302 --> 06:26.846
He was a teacher
on the ark.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.723
This is Indra.

06:28.931 --> 06:33.770
She's leader of Trikru
and a trusted ally.

06:33.978 --> 06:37.607
I'll have to take
your word for it.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.734
Uh!

06:39.942 --> 06:41.819
Uh!

06:42.028 --> 06:44.072
Kane, it's time to go.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.783
Monty, give them
the coordinates to Arkadia.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.077
We have a settlement
50 Miles South of here.

06:49.285 --> 06:50.953
Your people will
be safe there.

06:51.162 --> 06:52.538
You're my people.

06:52.747 --> 06:54.374
Good, because we
have reports

06:54.582 --> 06:56.751
that put Clarke
north of here.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.880
We could certainly
use your expertise.

07:01.089 --> 07:02.757
If she's in
the ice nation,

07:02.965 --> 07:04.467
you're gonna need
more than that.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.220
We leave no one behind.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.347
Lacroix, take the team.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.600
Rendezvous with the others.
Get them to Arkadia.

07:12.809 --> 07:14.185
I'm staying
with my son.

07:14.394 --> 07:16.771
Damn right, you are.
Mount up.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.731
We're going back
into hell.

07:29.784 --> 07:30.910
On your feet.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.798
Looks like
the great Wanheda

07:44.006 --> 07:45.842
is human, after all.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.033
Huh!

08:12.285 --> 08:13.244
Hngh...

08:19.667 --> 08:21.502
- Waah!
- Uh! Uh!

08:40.313 --> 08:41.689
Yeah. That's better.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.404
You're ice nation.

09:06.714 --> 09:10.343
Smart move, leaving
that guard jacket inside.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.233
- Fighter approaching.
- Where?

09:25.441 --> 09:27.235
Outside pole 20.

09:27.443 --> 09:28.528
The kill order.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.488
We have to get you
inside the wall.

09:30.696 --> 09:31.572
Here.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.208
Nyko.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.543
Lincoln, be careful.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.088
Hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.508
Hold your fire!

09:52.635 --> 09:54.470
- Aagh!
- Come on.

09:54.679 --> 09:55.846
Abby.

09:56.055 --> 09:58.683
We'll take you
to her.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.021
Nyko, chon
Dula Dison?

10:06.857 --> 10:08.651
Rrgh!

10:13.364 --> 10:15.992
Generally, a follow-up
appointment

10:16.200 --> 10:18.619
is about checking
the old injury,

10:18.828 --> 10:21.330
not treating
new ones.

10:21.539 --> 10:24.083
I was trying to make the most
of our time together, doc.

10:33.384 --> 10:35.136
Can we talk
about this one?

10:35.344 --> 10:38.389
You said
I was fine.

10:38.598 --> 10:41.767
I understand how much
Maya meant to you.

10:44.687 --> 10:48.065
What is it you
want to talk about,

10:48.274 --> 10:49.609
how dead she still is?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.319
Jasper, you're never
gonna move past this

10:51.527 --> 10:53.446
unless you face your
feelings head on.

10:55.281 --> 11:00.786
Your friend Finn,
he never did that,

11:00.995 --> 11:03.539
and it broke him.

11:03.748 --> 11:06.667
I don't want that
happening to you.

11:09.462 --> 11:11.756
Your daughter
killed him, too.

11:16.886 --> 11:19.722
Abby, Abby,
it's Nyko.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.185
He said it was
Azgeda, the ice nation.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.728
- Where?
- We don't know.

11:25.936 --> 11:26.979
His pulse is weak,
and he's burning up.

11:27.188 --> 11:28.022
Clotting has
stopped the flow,

11:28.230 --> 11:29.315
but he's lost
too much blood.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.859
I'll type him.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.324
Rh null.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.619
What's wrong?
We're universal donors.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.496
- Here. Take mine.
- No. You can't.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.873
Rh null can only
take RH null.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.681
Well, I don't understand.
Can you save him or not?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.474
- Not here.
- Jackson--

12:03.683 --> 12:04.809
wait. What's he
talking about?

12:05.017 --> 12:07.103
I'm talking about
mount weather.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.772
The medical facility in that
Mountain is state-of-the-art.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.941
They relied on blood to survive.
It's still all there.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.359
You want me
to bring a grounder

12:13.567 --> 12:15.736
into mount weather
for a transfusion?

12:15.945 --> 12:17.029
They killed
thousands of people

12:17.238 --> 12:18.447
for that blood,
Jackson.

12:18.656 --> 12:20.032
We can't just let him
die, Abby. We're doctors.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.451
- I am not just a doctor.
- Maybe you should be.

12:25.663 --> 12:29.667
Lincoln, you said
to me yesterday

12:29.875 --> 12:32.211
that even our supply runs
were putting us at risk.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.671
They were jeopardizing
our peace.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.923
Yeah.

12:37.425 --> 12:40.052
How would you
advise me now?

12:42.304 --> 12:44.598
Lincoln--

12:44.807 --> 12:47.768
he's my friend.

12:49.562 --> 12:51.355
Save him.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.443
Get him ready
for transport.

12:58.696 --> 13:01.741
I hope you're ready
to face your feelings.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.201
Uh!

13:05.411 --> 13:07.830
Uh! Uh!

13:11.876 --> 13:13.002
- Oh!
- Rrgh!

13:13.210 --> 13:14.587
Uh!

13:14.795 --> 13:17.465
Uh! Uh! Oh!

13:17.673 --> 13:19.675
Yah! Uhh...

13:22.261 --> 13:23.679
Huh...Uh!

13:23.888 --> 13:25.431
Yaah!

13:28.601 --> 13:29.852
Uh!

13:30.060 --> 13:32.480
Uh! Uh! Agh...

13:38.527 --> 13:39.361
Weron--

13:44.116 --> 13:46.911
Are you OK?
You all right?

13:50.456 --> 13:52.458
Bounty hunter.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.090
- English.
- Pike, go outside.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.218
Take Monty and Hannah.
Search the perimeter.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.553
Make sure
he was alone.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.024
So was he.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.735
Please.
She's in danger.

14:19.944 --> 14:22.446
You're Skaikru?

14:22.655 --> 14:25.157
Yeah.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.827
She was here
last night.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.453
Did she say where
she was going?

14:29.662 --> 14:31.539
No. She was here
when I fell asleep

14:31.747 --> 14:33.207
and gone when
I woke up.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.626
She give you any indication
of where she might go?

14:35.835 --> 14:38.546
No...

14:38.754 --> 14:41.382
But he did.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.843
He said that his partner
came back for her.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.762
He was ice nation.

14:46.971 --> 14:49.640
- I hope you find her.
- Thank you.

14:49.849 --> 14:52.017
Good news. I found
fresh tracks.

14:52.226 --> 14:53.519
Great.
Start the rover.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.355
That's the bad news--
too many trees.

14:56.564 --> 14:58.816
We have to go on foot.

15:06.407 --> 15:08.617
Uh!

15:08.826 --> 15:10.703
Quiet.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.586
Ice nation scouts.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.923
Come on.
We backtrack.

15:23.132 --> 15:24.884
Then we go around.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.760
Aah!

15:26.927 --> 15:29.847
Ooh! Oh!

15:30.055 --> 15:32.892
Their deaths
are on you.

16:44.755 --> 16:47.091
Didn't have
to be this way.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.679
- Uh!
- Oh!

16:51.887 --> 16:53.263
Uh!

16:57.393 --> 16:58.978
If you were
gonna kill me,

16:59.186 --> 17:00.771
you would've
done it already.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.856
There's still time.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.824
Arrive level 3.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.663
- How you holding up?
- Don't worry about me.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.790
Just get the blood.
I'll prep him.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.838
Don't do
anything stupid.

17:31.719 --> 17:35.222
You mean like coming back here?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.983
You haven't told me
what happened to dad.

17:48.027 --> 17:51.697
All you father wanted
was to find you.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.658
He loved you.
That's what matters.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.957
Ask you a question?

18:02.166 --> 18:04.126
Last report we got
on the ark,

18:04.334 --> 18:06.587
you were under
attack by grounders.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.797
What changed?

18:09.006 --> 18:10.924
Well, it turns out,
we had a common enemy.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.802
What happened
to them?

18:14.011 --> 18:15.304
- We won.
- Quiet.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.224
Listen.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.895
War drums.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.521
Azgeda.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.273
You can tell it's
ice nation from the sound?

18:26.482 --> 18:30.152
No, from them.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.237
We need to get
those bodies off the field

18:32.446 --> 18:34.281
unless you're good with them
thinking we did this.

18:34.490 --> 18:35.532
Go. Hurry.

18:35.741 --> 18:37.701
Wait.
Two people at 12 o'clock.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.875
It's Clarke.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.795
- Hey, hey, hey! Ho!
- Get out of my way.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.547
- You'll never make it in time.
- He's right. Look.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.094
No way we get across
without being seen.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.805
We should lay low,
let the army pass.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.182
Then we find Clarke.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.395
Guys, there's
a cave.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.274
We just got lucky.
Come on.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.776
- I can't go with you.
- Why?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.152
Ice nation has
crossed the border.

19:12.361 --> 19:13.487
They're marching
against my commander.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.738
I have to warn her.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.365
- We'll get Clarke.
- You better.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.574
The ice queen
gets her first,

19:17.783 --> 19:20.244
she'll be dead,
and we'll be at war.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.025
Scream again, and
we'll both be dead.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.079
Hey...

20:06.248 --> 20:08.000
You really been
to the city of light?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.209
Shut up, Otan.

20:09.418 --> 20:11.837
I'm not listening to
that Skrish again.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.427
Come.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.888
Walk with me.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.308
Thank God
he's got somebody else

20:24.516 --> 20:26.101
to preach to now, huh?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.187
Not a believer?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.397
I believe you're
here for a reason.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.317
Just don't know
what it is yet.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.487
We were recruited.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.198
Recruited by who?

20:39.406 --> 20:40.824
I don't know
her name.

20:41.033 --> 20:44.036
She comes to us
in the flying machine.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.623
You mean the drone.
Yeah.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.667
That's how she
found us, too.

20:50.876 --> 20:51.960
So what do you
do for her?

20:52.169 --> 20:53.629
We collect tech.

20:53.837 --> 20:54.880
You mean steal it.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.507
- When we have to.
- Right.

20:57.716 --> 21:02.137
We bring it
to the island, to him.

21:02.346 --> 21:05.015
That's how we survive.

21:05.224 --> 21:09.019
This time, she said
they needed a ride.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.818
What are you doing?

21:18.695 --> 21:20.239
Don't try
to be a hero,

21:20.447 --> 21:21.949
and I'll leave you
on your feet this time.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.951
Oh, a hero?

21:24.159 --> 21:26.536
And here, I thought
you got me.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.038
Come on. Really, are
you about to steal

21:28.247 --> 21:29.539
from the people
you steal for?

21:29.748 --> 21:33.835
Shh. We have other buyers.
Now be quiet.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.097
Bad idea.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.945
OK. Oh, easy, easy.
Hey, come on.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.905
Hey, big fella, come on.
There's no harm done, all right?

22:02.114 --> 22:05.325
Just put her down.
Just put her down, all right?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.707
Yah! Yah!

22:11.915 --> 22:14.293
There is no pain in
the city of light.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.755
Uh!

22:34.688 --> 22:36.606
You coming, or what?

22:51.913 --> 22:54.916
Nngh...Ohh...

23:07.846 --> 23:09.473
Uh...

23:11.600 --> 23:12.684
Nngh...

23:13.935 --> 23:16.980
Another inch,
and I'd be dead.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.318
Maybe you're not the
commander of death, after all.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.364
Now she's quiet.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.994
Why are you hiding
from your own people?

23:31.203 --> 23:33.705
Why'd you run
away from yours?

23:47.177 --> 23:50.597
The great Wanheda...

23:59.022 --> 24:00.732
Mountain slayer.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.152
I'm no one.

24:06.238 --> 24:09.866
Lot of people out there
right now looking for no one.

24:10.075 --> 24:14.204
You're obviously not
loyal to the ice nation,

24:14.413 --> 24:16.123
so why are you
taking me there?

24:20.168 --> 24:22.254
Look. Whatever the
ice queen is giving you,

24:22.462 --> 24:25.006
my people will
offer you more.

24:25.215 --> 24:27.592
Doubt that,

24:27.801 --> 24:29.469
not for someone
who abandoned them.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.515
You don't know
anything about me.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.017
I know you took
the coward's way out.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.061
Like you're
so different?

24:38.270 --> 24:41.606
You're in disguise,
same as me.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.317
You're on the run,
same as me,

24:44.526 --> 24:46.862
in the wilderness,
same as me.

24:47.070 --> 24:50.198
I was banished,
nothing like you.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.701
You had a choice,

24:52.909 --> 24:56.913
and, no, I can't take you
home to your people...

25:00.667 --> 25:02.878
Because you're the way
back home to mine.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.139
- We're losing her.
- Relax. Save your energy.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.933
Kane's right, son.
The army will move soon.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.186
You'll need your strength
for what comes next.

25:39.623 --> 25:42.542
I need to know
what happened.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.046
Monty--

25:46.254 --> 25:48.089
please.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.476
We landed in the snow.

26:05.106 --> 26:08.235
Your father said

26:08.443 --> 26:10.487
it absorbed
some of the impact.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.988
That's why
we survived.

26:16.409 --> 26:20.747
The snow looked
so beautiful, it--

26:25.252 --> 26:26.127
Charles?

26:28.129 --> 26:31.299
The children
were playing in it.

26:36.263 --> 26:39.975
They were
the first to die...

26:41.685 --> 26:43.520
15 of them.

26:45.480 --> 26:50.110
If not for your father,
would've been more.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.696
He pulled 4 kids
back into the ship,

26:52.904 --> 26:56.032
all 4 alive today.

26:58.952 --> 27:02.289
They got him when he
went back for the fifth.

27:04.958 --> 27:08.295
Your father died
a hero, Monty.

27:13.216 --> 27:16.636
We've been fighting
grounders ever since.

27:16.845 --> 27:19.347
That was the ice nation.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.309
Not all grounders
are the same.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.603
They are to me.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.742
As soon as Otan
gets here, we can leave.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.493
Partners
in crime, huh?

27:46.583 --> 27:50.253
Whatever's in there,
we'll split it 3 ways.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.256
You earned that.

27:53.465 --> 27:55.175
Yeah, and all we had
to do was kill a guy.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.521
Thank you for
saving my life.

28:15.236 --> 28:16.905
Let me.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.998
I could've
done that.

28:33.296 --> 28:37.092
Ah, now,
that's tech.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.972
It's more
than just tech.

28:43.181 --> 28:45.016
Stupid son of a bitch
brought her with him.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.977
Brought who
with him?

28:49.604 --> 28:50.855
Took you
long enough.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.399
You shouldn't
have opened that.

28:52.607 --> 28:54.359
We needed to see what
we had. Check it out.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.156
You're not wearing
your scarf.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.206
How'd you know
how to do that?

29:08.415 --> 29:10.125
Give me the
backpack, John.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.335
Heh. No.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.632
- Huh!
- Oh, easy. Ea--come on. Easy.

29:18.925 --> 29:22.053
What are you doing?
Otan, let me go.

29:22.262 --> 29:24.973
Doesn't have to be
this way, John.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.599
What the hell
is going on?

29:26.808 --> 29:28.768
Otan ate the damn chip.
That's what's going on.

29:28.977 --> 29:31.062
No one else has
to die today.

29:31.271 --> 29:33.648
Tell me, is your imaginary
friend waterproof?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.484
- Should we find out?
- She's not imaginary.

29:36.693 --> 29:39.946
She's very, very real,
and she can help you.

29:40.155 --> 29:42.991
All you have to do
is say yes.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.952
All you have to do
is let her go.

29:46.119 --> 29:49.330
You're in a lot
of pain, John.

29:49.539 --> 29:51.541
I've been there.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.377
Losing my son
almost killed me.

29:54.586 --> 29:57.380
The city of light
unburdened me.

29:57.589 --> 30:00.383
It made me whole.

30:00.592 --> 30:03.803
I can unburden
you, John.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.931
You just simply
return what's mine.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.604
- I got a better idea.
- Stop!

30:12.812 --> 30:14.439
You want me to stop?

30:14.647 --> 30:17.025
You let her go right
now, or I'm gonna

30:17.233 --> 30:19.319
drown the bitch
in the red dress.

30:29.788 --> 30:32.749
- Good.
- Otan--

30:32.957 --> 30:34.918
Emori, get
in the boat.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.590
Now give me the pack.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.887
It's all yours,
chancellor. Uh!

30:47.680 --> 30:52.352
Start the boat.
We're leaving.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.145
Bon voyage, Jaha.

31:04.697 --> 31:07.158
We should
go after them.

31:07.367 --> 31:12.288
There's no need.
They'll understand.

31:12.497 --> 31:15.124
How can you
be so sure?

31:15.333 --> 31:18.920
Because I haven't
told you the best part.

31:20.964 --> 31:24.008
You know there's
no pain here.

31:24.217 --> 31:28.638
There's no death
in the city of light, either.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.620
He's waking up.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.877
Hey...

32:11.681 --> 32:14.225
Thank you, Abby.

32:14.434 --> 32:16.102
When can we
move him?

32:16.269 --> 32:17.729
Doesn't look good
for us to be here.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.022
This place just
saved his life.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.940
It's not
that simple.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.276
Our people,
they'll never see

32:23.484 --> 32:25.278
anything but
death here.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.906
Our people
are wrong, Lincoln,

32:28.114 --> 32:31.534
and we can
change their minds.

32:31.743 --> 32:36.080
Places are not evil,
brother.

32:36.289 --> 32:39.125
People are.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.794
Abby,
this place,

32:42.003 --> 32:45.089
it could do
so much good

32:45.298 --> 32:47.926
for our people
and theirs.

32:58.394 --> 33:01.356
We have to find
hope somewhere.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.364
OK.

33:12.408 --> 33:13.826
OK what?

33:17.497 --> 33:19.582
OK. Let's open it up.

33:36.683 --> 33:37.892
Where is it?

33:43.523 --> 33:45.358
Come on! Uh!

33:46.985 --> 33:47.860
Uh!

33:48.987 --> 33:51.072
Agh!

33:54.242 --> 33:56.160
Yaah! Aah! Aah!

33:56.369 --> 33:57.745
Aah!

34:28.067 --> 34:30.653
- Hey--
- I'm fine.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.034
This was her favorite...

34:38.119 --> 34:41.039
Represents the second
circle of hell,

34:41.247 --> 34:45.376
which is pretty ironic
if you think about it.

34:48.671 --> 34:52.383
I told her
I liked it, but--

34:52.592 --> 34:53.760
I don't know.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.853
I miss her.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.820
It'll get better.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.827
Wh--when?

35:20.995 --> 35:24.082
42 of us got out alive.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.584
We did what we had to.

35:26.793 --> 35:30.588
You did the right thing.
Kill or be killed.

35:35.384 --> 35:38.179
So mount weather
is ours now?

35:38.387 --> 35:40.223
Yeah.

35:41.599 --> 35:43.017
Yeah. We use it
for supplies.

35:43.226 --> 35:44.560
Supplies?

35:44.769 --> 35:46.729
It's a nuclear-hardened
underground city.

35:46.938 --> 35:49.065
We established
a truce.

35:49.273 --> 35:50.817
We need to think
about perception.

35:51.025 --> 35:52.276
You need to think
about what happens

35:52.485 --> 35:53.986
when the grounders
break that truce,

35:54.195 --> 35:55.738
because they will.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.790
Oh, crap.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.419
Bellamy,
what are you doing?

36:22.557 --> 36:25.017
Hmm.

37:24.577 --> 37:26.370
Huh...

37:28.331 --> 37:30.541
Bellamy.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.501
- I'll get you out of here.
- Look out!

37:32.710 --> 37:35.588
Uh! Ooh! Uh!

37:35.796 --> 37:37.340
Oh, please.
Please don't.

37:37.548 --> 37:39.926
I'll do anything.
I--I'll stop fighting.

37:40.134 --> 37:43.012
Just please don't
kill him.

37:53.147 --> 37:53.981
Thank you.

37:54.190 --> 37:55.691
- Huh!
- Aagh!

37:55.900 --> 37:57.360
Huh! Aagh!

37:57.568 --> 38:00.529
Don't follow us.

38:10.498 --> 38:13.668
Ugh! Ah...

38:13.876 --> 38:16.295
Uh! Ah!

38:16.504 --> 38:19.090
Huh...Gaah! Aagh!

38:19.298 --> 38:21.509
Bellamy.
He's hurt.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.970
He's here.

38:24.178 --> 38:25.763
We told you to wait
for the army to move.

38:25.972 --> 38:27.682
What happened?

38:27.890 --> 38:31.435
I--I--I almost
got her. I--

38:31.644 --> 38:33.688
pike, find
their trail.

38:33.896 --> 38:36.816
Its useless. He knows
he's being followed now.

38:41.237 --> 38:43.531
- Ah!
- Hey...

38:43.739 --> 38:46.325
You can't even walk.

38:46.534 --> 38:49.912
So, what, we--
we give up,

38:50.121 --> 38:52.164
let him kill her?

38:52.373 --> 38:54.083
Rrgh! God...

38:54.292 --> 38:57.169
Bellamy, I want
to find her, too,

38:57.378 --> 38:58.879
but look
at your leg.

38:59.088 --> 39:00.131
You could die out here.
We have no trail.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.466
We can't
lose Clarke. We--

39:07.388 --> 39:09.473
we can't lose her.

39:09.682 --> 39:12.018
We'll find her, OK?

39:12.226 --> 39:14.061
We will figure
something out, I promise...

39:16.355 --> 39:18.941
But this
isn't the way.

39:24.655 --> 39:26.699
OK.

39:26.907 --> 39:28.701
I got you.
Come on.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.536
Let's head back.

39:51.474 --> 39:52.683
Hello, Clarke.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.694
The deal was for you to
bring her to me unharmed.

40:03.903 --> 40:06.155
She didn't
come easy.

40:06.364 --> 40:09.617
I'd expect not.

40:09.825 --> 40:13.037
I've done my part.
Now do yours.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.790
Lift my banishment.

40:15.998 --> 40:18.626
I'm told your mother's army
marches on Polis.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.628
That has nothing
to do with me.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.254
Honor our deal.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.007
I'll honor our deal when
your queen honors my coalition.

40:25.216 --> 40:28.594
Lock prince roan
of Azgeda away.

40:28.803 --> 40:29.970
- Yes, Heda.
- Yes, Heda.

40:38.396 --> 40:40.231
- What of Wanheda?
- Leave us.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.073
You heard me.

40:57.665 --> 40:59.458
Uh!

41:00.751 --> 41:03.921
I'm sorry.

41:04.130 --> 41:06.257
It had to be
this way.

41:06.465 --> 41:07.842
Had to ensure Wanheda
didn't fall

41:08.050 --> 41:10.886
into the hands
of the ice queen.

41:11.095 --> 41:14.890
War is brewing,
Clarke.

41:15.099 --> 41:16.892
I need you.

41:17.101 --> 41:19.645
Uh! Aah! You bitch!

41:19.854 --> 41:22.064
Ugh! You wanted
the commander of death?

41:22.273 --> 41:24.942
You've got her! Aah!

41:25.151 --> 41:27.862
I'll kill you! Aah!

41:28.070 --> 41:31.657
Aah! No! Oh!

41:31.824 --> 41:36.036
Aah! Aah! Oh! Aah!
