A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.804 --> 00:14.764
[narrator] <i>It begins like this.</i>

00:16.307 --> 00:19.144
<i>Two billion years ago, an amoeba.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.689
<i>Wait, let's... let's back up.</i>
<i>I've skipped too many connections.</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:27.652
<i>Out of nothing,</i>
<i>in an instant... everything.</i>

00:28.194 --> 00:32.365
<i>An infinite cosmic orgy</i>
<i>of matter and energy,</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:35.285
<i>rubbing, bumping, and grinding together.</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:38.747
<i>There would be no galaxies,</i>
<i>no suns, no planets,</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:42.333
<i>no life without collisions</i>
<i>of heavenly bodies.</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:43.960
<i>Back to our amoeba.</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:49.174
<i>It engulfs a bacterium with unique powers,</i>
<i>and... voil√†.</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:52.927
<i>Earth's first</i>
<i>photosynthesis-enabled organism.</i>

00:53.970 --> 00:55.180
<i>Maybe it was chance.</i>

00:55.889 --> 00:57.307
<i>Maybe it was inevitable.</i>

00:57.932 --> 00:59.642
<i>This one changed amoeba</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:03.104
<i>becomes the ancestor</i>
<i>of every living plant on Earth,</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:05.774
<i>which in turn floods the planet</i>
<i>with oxygen...</i> <i>paving the way</i>
<i>for every other form of life we know...</i>

01:11.613 --> 01:13.490
<i>leading to more souls, more connections,</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:16.910
<i>and therefore more new worlds</i>
<i>branching outward from the first.</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:20.580
<i>These forces of nature,</i>
<i>when they converge,</i>

01:20.663 --> 01:24.501
<i>be they astronomical collisions,</i>
<i>biological unions,</i>

01:24.584 --> 01:28.338
<i>demonstrate the infinite potential</i>
<i>of our connections.</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:33.218
<i>This truth also extends</i>
<i>to the human heart.</i>

01:35.220 --> 01:36.096
Pack of Stuttons.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.682
[clears throat]

01:40.850 --> 01:42.811
No offense,
but how are you gonna pay for these?

01:43.478 --> 01:46.064
I'm gonna use an adBuddy
to cover this purchase.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.776
Those assholes
record client conversations.

01:49.859 --> 01:50.944
AD BUDDY NOT ACCEPTED

01:51.027 --> 01:52.612
National Database of Desires.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.322
The businessmen, ever hear of it?

01:54.405 --> 01:55.990
They know you better than you know you.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.409
-Okay.
-It's not a conspiracy,

01:58.493 --> 01:59.953
just a conspiracy theory.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.246
[narrator] <i>Hypothesis...</i>

02:01.996 --> 02:04.207
<i>all souls are on a quest to connect.</i>

02:06.334 --> 02:07.168
<i>Corollary...</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:09.712
<i>our minds have no awareness of this quest.</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:15.135
Oh.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.013
[sighs]

02:19.764 --> 02:23.101
Did you know that most quarters have been
swallowed and defecated by a human?

02:24.227 --> 02:28.231
[narrator] <i>Hypothesis...</i>
<i>all the worlds that almost were</i>

02:28.314 --> 02:30.608
<i>matter just as much as the world we're in.</i>

02:33.444 --> 02:34.320
<i>Corollary...</i>

02:34.863 --> 02:38.116
<i>these hidden worlds cause us great pain.</i>

02:38.199 --> 02:39.534
...no wallet, no shoes.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.954
No idea how I even really got to Poland
in the first place.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.540
Bro, I'm telling you,

02:45.623 --> 02:48.918
this was seriously such a crazy situation.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.589
Th... From Poland... I was in...

02:52.672 --> 02:55.049
I had no idea...
I had no idea how I got there.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.719
[narrator] <i>Camaraderie, communion,</i>

02:58.595 --> 03:00.597

03:02.807 --> 03:04.017
[chuckles and sighs]

03:04.100 --> 03:06.019
<i>We're lost without connection.</i>

03:06.102 --> 03:08.146
EVERYTHING TASTES BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER

03:08.271 --> 03:10.148
[woman] <i>...relationships are tough.</i>

03:10.815 --> 03:12.483
<i>Thank you, Friend Proxy.</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:16.154
[narrator]<i> It's quite terrible...</i>
<i>to be alone.</i>

03:17.447 --> 03:19.157
NOT ALL HUGS ARE CREATED EQUAL

03:20.950 --> 03:23.536
<i>Put simply, my goal is to eradicate all...</i>

03:24.662 --> 03:27.582
<i>unnecessary and inefficient forms</i>
<i>of human pain.</i>

03:28.958 --> 03:29.792
<i>Forever.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:33.254
<i>We must evolve past our suffering.</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:36.841
It's trash, not a handout. Let's move it.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.385
What are you, a cop?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.680
Not much of a difference authority-wise.
Let's go.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.853
MILGRIM INDUSTRIES

03:48.937 --> 03:51.356
[narrator]
<i>My research into this matter is...</i>

03:52.148 --> 03:53.358
<i>of course, ongoing.</i>

04:00.823 --> 04:02.992
[man] The witness
has already been sworn in.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.578
Mr. Milgrim, can you state for the court

04:05.662 --> 04:08.331
your relationship with the defendant,
Mr. Jed Milgrim?

04:09.540 --> 04:11.209
He's, um...

04:12.335 --> 04:14.045
-He's my brother.
-[man] Thank you.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.880
Have you ever been arrested? -No.
-[man] Are you married?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.344
-No.
-[man] Children?

04:24.681 --> 04:25.765
No.

04:25.848 --> 04:29.018
[man] And can you tell us
about the psychotic break

04:29.102 --> 04:31.396
that you experienced
roughly ten years ago?

04:33.022 --> 04:34.774
-Really?
-[man] I'm just asking.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.193
That's how they're gonna start?
Dad, come on.

04:38.278 --> 04:43.074
It doesn't necessarily mean that
it'll be like that in the trial, Owen,

04:44.117 --> 04:47.578
but, uh, sometimes prosecutors, they...

04:47.662 --> 04:50.373
they try atypical inroads...

04:52.083 --> 04:53.167
to crack you.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.838
That's why we...
we have to prep for the unexpected.

04:58.756 --> 04:59.841
Can you resume, please?

05:00.216 --> 05:03.303
Have you ever been hospitalized
for mental illness?

05:11.936 --> 05:13.563
Yes, ten years ago.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.857
Please explain what happened.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.776
[Owen] I was hospitalized...

05:19.610 --> 05:20.945
and medicated...

05:22.905 --> 05:23.948
and...

05:26.826 --> 05:31.956
that was the last episode I had.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.959
Wasn't the nature
of this psychosis delusional?

05:35.043 --> 05:38.463
That you sometimes thought you saw
your brother when he wasn't there?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.173
[Owen] Not exactly.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.383
Just say no.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.553
Then what was the nature
of this psychosis?

05:58.733 --> 06:02.779
[sighs] Owen, don't you think
that your mental illness

06:02.862 --> 06:06.199
should disqualify you from testifying
as a witness on your brother's behalf?

06:06.282 --> 06:09.118
Look, there's only one question here
that really matters.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.829
Owen, do you know what is real?

06:18.711 --> 06:19.879
One hundred percent.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.508
I'm<i> compos mentis.</i>

06:28.763 --> 06:30.640
[woman] Welcome to New York.

06:30.890 --> 06:35.812
And this is Statue of Extra Liberty. <i>Da.</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:40.108
Statue of Extra Liberty. Okay.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.151
[woman continues speaking in Russian]

06:44.612 --> 06:46.614
[foghorn blares]

06:48.574 --> 06:51.244
[man] How'd the trial prep go
for a naughty brother?

06:52.328 --> 06:53.704
Did you tell them about me?

06:54.622 --> 06:56.332
You're not supposed to be here.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.252
[man] Good.
You're still using the code words,

06:59.335 --> 07:01.295
even though I am technically invisible.

07:02.296 --> 07:05.383
Owen, this week must be
a doozy for you, huh?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.803
You thought you were rid of me,
but I have new information.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.556
This time I know.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.439
You've been chosen to save the world.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.024
You're gonna be a hero.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.401
[foghorn blares]

07:23.484 --> 07:25.236
I don't want this. I don't want it.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.113
I don't want this.

07:27.196 --> 07:30.783
The details of the mission will be
delivered to you by an agent, a woman.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.493
You'll know her
when you see her, trust me.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.412
Just make contact with her.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.539
The pattern is the pattern.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.251
She'll reach you for further instructions!

07:41.043 --> 07:42.420
[yells] Don't fuck this up!

[Ad Buddy] <i>Okay, Mr. Milgrim,</i>
<i>I'm gonna need your attention.</i>

"When tragedy strikes others,

09:06.754 --> 09:09.298
it's sometimes hard to know
what to do until now..."

09:10.258 --> 09:11.092
Owen.

09:11.592 --> 09:15.471
"Daddy's Home. Consider becoming
a temporary volunteer mail-order husband

09:15.555 --> 09:18.724
and changing the lives
of a heartbroken family in your region."

09:18.808 --> 09:19.642
YOU ARE HERE

09:20.142 --> 09:22.061
Okay, well, up next,

09:22.144 --> 09:26.023
we got something called
Neberdine Pharmaceuticals.

09:26.107 --> 09:26.941
[clears throat]

09:27.692 --> 09:29.068
"Good afternoon, Owen.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.947
Did you know that your rent comprises
87.2 percent of your annual income?"

09:34.615 --> 09:35.741
Is that actually true?

09:37.618 --> 09:40.997
-I just moved into my own place.
-[Ad Buddy] Manhattan these days...

09:41.497 --> 09:43.624
I'm over in an underground warehouse unit.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.334
Hoboken.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.713
-I actually live in Roosevelt Island.
-Okay, well...

09:49.547 --> 09:51.674
Uh, let's see. Oh-ho-ho.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.677
"A catastrophic interruption
in your professional life,

09:55.136 --> 09:57.054
like a furlough, could ruin you.

09:57.513 --> 10:01.183
Ever thought about supplementing
your income with pharmaceutical testing?"

10:01.517 --> 10:03.561
Friend Proxy.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.147
"Tired of spending your time and energy
making friends?"

10:06.230 --> 10:09.859
[operator] <i>And that is why Daddy's Home</i>
<i>is happy to welcome you, Mr. Milgrim.</i>

10:09.942 --> 10:12.194
[Owen] And I'd have to cover
relocation costs?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.614
[operator] <i>And inherit any potential debt</i>
<i>of the deceased.</i>

10:14.697 --> 10:15.948
That doesn't make sense.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.700
<i>So, that's a yes?</i>

10:18.534 --> 10:19.452
To what?

10:19.535 --> 10:21.037
[operator] <i>It makes perfect sense.</i>

10:21.120 --> 10:23.623
<i>-We are offering you heroism.</i>
-[man] So this is your office area.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.416
Again, it's a question of commitment.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.168
[Owen] Your ad is misleading,

10:27.251 --> 10:30.755
'cause you refer to it
as a volunteer opportunity,

10:30.838 --> 10:32.882
but in the end I'd have to pay.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.217
[operator] <i>But think about</i>
<i>what you'd be getting.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.386

-[Owen] Yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.680
-[operator] <i>Owen. It's a done deal.</i>
-I have to go.

with a 12-bullet short-termer.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.648
-When?
-Well, they randomized the pattern.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.359
We've sent out 30 memos on it
since this morning.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.445
Um, so this furlough,
how long does it last?

10:54.945 --> 10:56.697
-It's temporary.
-Right.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.158
So... when am I back?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.745
Oh, I don't know. I was kidding.
It's probably permanent.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.044
I was using your kind of humor,

11:10.127 --> 11:13.589
when you say something you don't mean
and nobody laughs.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.468
It's... Yeah, it's okay. I'll just...

11:18.636 --> 11:20.513
I'll just dip into my savings.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.018
Bye.

12:05.850 --> 12:06.684

[man] <i>The way this deprogramming works,</i>
<i>it's not an overnight fix.</i>

12:10.271 --> 12:12.398
<i>You have to listen to it like a mantra.</i>

<i>If you start feeling paranoid,</i>
<i>you play this tape right away, okay?</i>

12:17.194 --> 12:18.028
[Owen] <i>Okay.</i>

12:18.446 --> 12:21.240
[man] <i>Now, stop me when I say something</i>
<i>that's not true.</i>

12:21.907 --> 12:23.492
<i>The world sends you messages.</i>

12:24.368 --> 12:25.244
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

12:25.327 --> 12:27.204
[man] <i>Words are often code words,</i>

12:27.288 --> 12:30.166
<i>or pass phrases for important secrets.</i>

12:30.666 --> 12:31.500
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

12:31.584 --> 12:34.628
[man] <i>You're visited by a brother</i>
<i>no one else in your family is aware of.</i>

12:34.712 --> 12:36.839
<i>A facsimile of your brother Jed.</i>

12:37.381 --> 12:39.133
-[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>
-[man] <i>He sends you messages.</i>

12:39.216 --> 12:42.595
<i>Instructions for important missions</i>

12:43.137 --> 12:44.930
[Owen] <i>To see the deeper truth.</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:47.349
[man] <i>He tells you you're meant</i>
<i>to do something big,</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:49.769
<i>something that matters to the world,</i> <i>and that you're not meant to do it alone.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:54.064
<i>All you need is a partner.</i>

12:55.191 --> 12:56.108
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

12:56.192 --> 12:59.069
[woman] <i>You made a promise to me,</i>
<i>and you made a promise to yourself.</i>

12:59.153 --> 13:02.323
<i>You promised we'd golf together</i>
<i>in Hilton Head.</i>

13:02.406 --> 13:05.826
[man] <i>You sense danger all around you,</i>
<i>but you stay disciplined.</i>

13:06.494 --> 13:07.495
<i>A fight's coming.</i>

13:07.578 --> 13:09.955
<i>Something even bigger than this world.</i>

13:10.039 --> 13:12.374
<i>Possibly extending to multiple galaxies.</i>

13:12.458 --> 13:14.710
-[elevator] <i>Fourth floor. Thank you.</i>
-[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

13:14.794 --> 13:16.253
Hello, Mrs. Finkelstein.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.963
Fuck off, Donovan.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.424
It's, uh... Owen.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.178
-Owen Milgrim...
-Fuck off, Donovan.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.095
Never mind. [man] <i>Good.</i>

13:27.389 --> 13:29.391
<i>Does it feel good to be heard?</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:30.351
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

13:30.434 --> 13:34.021
[man] <i>Does it feel good to know that</i>
<i>you're not alone with this information?</i>

13:34.104 --> 13:35.231
[Owen] <i>Yeah.</i>

13:35.314 --> 13:37.191
[man] <i>Will you complete your mission?</i>

13:38.108 --> 13:39.068
[Owen] <i>Maybe.</i>

13:39.401 --> 13:40.861
[man] <i>Am I a trusted messenger?</i>

13:42.404 --> 13:43.239
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

13:43.322 --> 13:45.741
[man] <i>Good.</i>
<i>Then here are your real instructions.</i>

13:46.116 --> 13:47.159
<i>Repeat after me.</i> <i>There is no pattern.</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:50.996
[Owen] <i>There is no pattern.</i>

13:51.288 --> 13:53.958
[man] <i>I am vulnerable,</i>
<i>but I am not stupid.</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:57.294
[Owen] <i>I'm vulnerable, but I'm not stupid.</i>

13:57.378 --> 14:01.006
[man] <i>But I will seek out the people</i>
<i>in my life that care about me.</i>

14:01.257 --> 14:04.260
[Owen] <i>I will seek out the people</i>
<i>in my life who care about me.</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:05.845
[man] <i>I am not the chosen one.</i>

14:06.178 --> 14:07.763
[Owen] <i>I am not the chosen one.</i>

14:07.847 --> 14:09.515
-[man] <i>The voices aren't real.</i>
-[clattering]

14:09.765 --> 14:11.892
-[Owen] <i>The voices aren't real.</i>
-The voices aren't real.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.644
[man] <i>The voices are just noise.</i>

14:13.727 --> 14:16.105
-[Owen] <i>The voices are just noise.</i>
-The voices are just noise.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.316
[man] <i>I am just a guy</i>
<i>with a vivid imagination.</i>

14:19.733 --> 14:21.777
[Owen] <i>I'm just a guy</i>
<i>with a vivid imagination.</i>

14:21.861 --> 14:23.070
[doorbell rings]

14:23.153 --> 14:26.824
[man] <i>I will most likely</i>
<i>not be the savior of our galaxy.</i>

14:26.907 --> 14:27.825
Hello?

14:29.201 --> 14:32.913
[man, distorted] <i>I've got a package</i>
<i>from Neberdine Pharmaceutical Biotech</i>

14:32.997 --> 14:34.957
<i>for an Owen Milgrim.</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:38.669
What?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.547
[man] <i>I've... a package... your name.</i>

14:43.591 --> 14:44.884
[buzzing]

14:47.344 --> 14:49.179
[running footsteps]

14:49.263 --> 14:51.223
-[knock at door]
-[footsteps hurry away]

14:53.475 --> 14:54.852
[door slams downstairs]

15:02.026 --> 15:04.445
[telephone rings]

15:12.244 --> 15:13.078
Hello?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.873
[woman] <i>Hi, Owen.</i>
<i>Did you get what I sent you?</i>

15:16.206 --> 15:17.124
[Owen] How did you...

15:17.207 --> 15:20.628
[woman] <i>I've just been informed</i>
<i>that you qualify as a hero candidate.</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:23.005
-What does that mean?
<i>-</i>[woman] <i>It's a term we use</i>

15:23.088 --> 15:26.133
<i>for those who've been specifically</i>
<i>selected for one of our studies.</i>

15:26.216 --> 15:28.802
<i>You're a very desirable individual</i>
<i>to us, Owen.</i>

15:29.136 --> 15:32.097
<i>I've never seen¬†B.N. over-ratios</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

15:35.267 --> 15:37.478
What does a hero candidate do?

15:37.561 --> 15:39.939
[woman] <i>Exactly the things</i>
<i>they were born to.</i>

15:40.022 --> 15:44.360
<i>In your case, helping us treat maladies</i>
<i>ranging from sluggishness and depression</i>

15:44.443 --> 15:48.405
<i>to I.B.S, to popcorn problems</i>
<i>and irrational fears.</i>

15:50.240 --> 15:51.867
"Popcorn problems"?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.535
[woman] <i>Prostate problems, yes.</i>

15:54.954 --> 15:55.829
Oh, I thought you...

15:55.913 --> 15:58.666
[woman] <i>We'll give you all the details</i>
<i>when you come in.</i>

15:58.749 --> 16:00.668
<i>So, we'll see you on Monday?</i>

16:00.751 --> 16:04.463
<i>‚ô™ Someday you're gonna feel lonely</i> ‚ô™

16:04.546 --> 16:05.381
[doorbell rings]

16:05.464 --> 16:09.885
<i>‚ô™ Someday you're gonna feel blue¬†‚ô™</i>

16:09.969 --> 16:13.806
<i>‚ô™ Someday you'll long for me only¬†‚ô™</i>

16:13.889 --> 16:15.224
Good evening, Mr. Milgrim.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.726
Everyone is on the patio for the recital.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.686
Thank you.

16:19.186 --> 16:23.983
<i>‚ô™ Someday you're gonna feel weary¬†‚ô™</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:28.028
<i>‚ô™ You'll grieve when I'm far away¬†‚ô™</i>

16:28.570 --> 16:33.242
<i>‚ô™ Then you'll be missin'</i>
<i>My huggin' and my kissin'¬†‚ô™</i>

16:33.325 --> 16:37.413
<i>‚ô™ You'll remember what I say¬†‚ô™</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:41.875
<i>‚ô™ You'll never know</i>
<i>The good fellow I've been ‚ô™</i>

16:41.959 --> 16:44.795
<i>-‚ô™Until I've gone away¬†‚ô™</i>
<i>-‚ô™Till I've gone away¬†‚ô™</i>

16:44.920 --> 16:46.547
<i>‚ô™ Gone away¬†‚ô™</i>

16:46.630 --> 16:51.010
<i>‚ô™ You're bound to miss</i>
<i>The little things that I did¬†‚ô™</i>

16:51.093 --> 16:55.139
-<i>‚ô™ I did¬†‚ô™</i>
-<i>‚ô™ For you each day ‚ô™</i>

16:55.222 --> 16:57.891
<i>-‚ô™ You're gonna yearn¬†‚ô™</i>
<i>-‚ô™ You will be yearning¬†‚ô™</i>

16:57.975 --> 17:00.436
<i>-‚ô™ For my returning¬†‚ô™</i>
<i>-‚ô™ For my returning¬†‚ô™</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:02.730
<i>-‚ô™ You're bound to miss me¬†‚ô™</i>
<i>-‚ô™ You're bound to miss me¬†‚ô™</i>

17:02.813 --> 17:05.607
<i>-‚ô™ You'll long to kiss me¬†‚ô™</i>
<i>-‚ô™ You'll long to kiss me¬†‚ô™</i>

17:05.691 --> 17:09.236
<i>‚ô™ You'll never know</i>
<i>The good fellow I've been¬†‚ô™</i>

17:09.319 --> 17:14.783
<i>-‚ô™ Until I've gone away¬†‚ô™</i>
<i>-‚ô™ Until I've gone away¬†‚ô™</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:21.832
<i>‚ô™ Till I've gone away¬†‚ô™</i>

17:23.667 --> 17:25.502
[cheering and applause]

17:25.586 --> 17:26.587
Thank you.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.174
Where does she sleep when she stays over?

17:30.257 --> 17:31.091
This one?

17:31.175 --> 17:32.926
Yeah, she's your sister, right?

17:33.927 --> 17:36.889
Or is she a secret agent?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.808
How did you know?

17:40.809 --> 17:45.189
[whispering]
Because I have super-secret sources

17:45.272 --> 17:47.941
at a super-secret agency.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.651
Don't tell anyone.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.736
[whispers] Okay.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.446
Supper's ready.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.490
Okay, Mom.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.784
I was completely baffled.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.702
You know, I left for school.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.372
Ernie was fine, and then, you know,
the food was in the bowl.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.291
The water was there,
cage was locked up,

18:04.374 --> 18:06.543
and I get back from basketball practice,

18:06.627 --> 18:10.339
-and he's just gone, absolutely...
-The great gerbil escape artist.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.256
[laughs]

18:11.340 --> 18:13.675
-But he wasn't exactly fucking gone.
-Language, Phil.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.637
No, that's correct.
He wasn't exactly fucking gone like that.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.597
-[hostess] Language, Jed.
-Where'd he go, O?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.101
Maybe you shouldn't curse so much
in front of the children.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.895
-Ah, come on. Tell the rest.
-[hostess] This is not a farmyard, boys.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.230
So, um, I ask everyone, right?

18:26.313 --> 18:28.774
Everyone's looking around the whole house,
everyone frantic,

18:28.857 --> 18:31.610
and finally Owen, you know,
eventually comes up

18:31.693 --> 18:33.028
and brings me to his room...

18:33.112 --> 18:35.155
How old were you then, Owen?
Like, eight or somethin'?

18:35.239 --> 18:36.698
-Nine.
-[Jed] Eight or nine, whatever.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.075
And he says-- he says,

18:38.158 --> 18:42.204
"Uh, I have to tell you somethin'.
My-- my hawk ate Ernie."

18:43.038 --> 18:44.915
"What?" And he points over there,

18:44.998 --> 18:47.167
and there's
this big fuckin' red-tailed hawk

18:47.251 --> 18:49.044
sitting on his desk staring at me.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.463
What eight-year-old has a fuckin' hawk?

18:51.547 --> 18:53.298
Uh, how did you have a hawk?

18:53.882 --> 18:57.136
Um, I rescued it from the park.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.140
I found it with a broken wing
and brought it to my room and fed it.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.100
-Yeah, I forgot.
-You'd feed him.

19:03.183 --> 19:07.020
That was the craziest part. He would
feed it, like a mother bird, you know...

19:07.771 --> 19:10.816
Oh, masticate-- No, no, no. Premasticate.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.235
-Yeah, premastication!
-Jed was a chronic masticater.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.987
-How'd you know?
-He'd go blind doing that.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.614
How long did you
take care of the bird for, Owen?

19:18.073 --> 19:20.701
Two or three months,
until it was strong enough

19:20.784 --> 19:24.621
to go into Jed's room
and eat his gerbil, I guess.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.498
[laughter]

19:26.582 --> 19:29.042
But what happened to the hawk?

19:30.377 --> 19:31.378
We set it free.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.589
Oh. Okay.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.923
[Owen's father] That reminds me.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.051
Remember when¬†Colby
fell in the Gowanus Canal?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.387
-Remember that day?
-[hostess] Oh, poor Colby.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.390
-I threw the stick, he didn't go for it--
-So traumatizing.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.933
[jazz music playing]

19:50.147 --> 19:53.400
[woman] I told Jed I wouldn't marry him
until they painted you in.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.028
Maybe that's why
we haven't set a date yet.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.698
They're gonna paint me in.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.993
The artist just took
a six-month sabbatical to Nepal,

20:03.076 --> 20:04.286
to study the light.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.248
I lost my job.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.878
I'm sorry, Owen.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.715
It's okay, I'll find a new one.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.134
I'm actually thinking about becoming

20:20.344 --> 20:21.887
a temporary volunteer husband.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.264
You're not serious.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.808
Get rid of my lease,
bounce from widow to widow.

20:26.934 --> 20:27.809
Mm-mm.

20:28.977 --> 20:33.732
Do you ever notice that your plans
always involve starting over...

20:34.233 --> 20:37.069
often with an entirely new identity?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.072
It's a good fantasy.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.617
[hostess] Pudding's upstairs
by the fireplace, everyone.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.080
Just to get through
the post-dinner conversation.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.674
Think about it.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.760
Seriously...

21:03.178 --> 21:04.346
as a hypothetical.

21:05.055 --> 21:08.267
Say you and I left, right? Tonight.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.771
I got us passports, new identities.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.275
You steal all the money
from Jed's bank account.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.111
We just... do that.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.155
We get a house in the middle of nowhere.

21:23.031 --> 21:23.949
Start again.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.076
Different people.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.995
Are we a married couple?

21:31.081 --> 21:31.915
We don't...

21:34.459 --> 21:35.919
We can be, you know...

21:36.003 --> 21:39.798
We don't have to be. We could be
brother, or sister, or... friends.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.634
So...

21:43.677 --> 21:45.178
tonight, then,

21:45.971 --> 21:47.014
after dessert?

21:48.724 --> 21:49.599
Yeah.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.644
I'm serious. Let's do it.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.484
You're fucking with me.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.197
I got you.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.240
[laughs]

22:07.826 --> 22:08.869
You believed me.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.833
This week's gonna be a living hell for me.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.586
[Owen sighs]

22:17.669 --> 22:18.837
He'll totally win.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.924
He's not guilty.
No chance of a conviction.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.177
It's all just so humiliating.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.096
I mean, it's been going on
for fucking ages,

22:28.180 --> 22:30.515
all just for one day in court.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.143
Because he didn't do it, so...

22:35.562 --> 22:36.688
You're positive?

22:37.814 --> 22:39.524
Right? You were actually with him?

22:42.069 --> 22:42.903
Yes.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.243
-[man] You would make that move.
-[Jed] What does that even mean?

22:50.327 --> 22:52.037
-"Make that move"?
-That's the move--

22:52.579 --> 22:54.790
Hey, Owen, you're not trying
to sneak off, are you?

22:54.873 --> 22:55.707
No, Dad.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.959
I need a second of your time
before you leave.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.629
Come on, boys, it's time.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.507
-[all] Balderdash!
-Oh!

23:03.590 --> 23:06.676
-[hostess] Owen, you're staying to play.
-No, I-I have to go.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.012
-I have something...
-You love Balderdash.

23:09.096 --> 23:09.930
No, I don't.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.099
Come on, stay, it will be fun.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.975
I have a fundamental problem
with Balderdash.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.436
I gotta say,
what a delicious meal that was.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.896
-Sure was.
-So good, Mom. So good.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.148
-You used to love Balderdash.
-Oh, no, I didn't.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.025
-[Jed] Who wants ice cream?
-[children yelling]

23:22.109 --> 23:25.070
-Who wants ice cream? Oh, you do?
-I do!

23:25.153 --> 23:29.324
Of course. But whoever's the quietest
gets ice cream, I promise. Mom.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.035
Oh, are we playing Balderdash, or what?

23:34.121 --> 23:36.248

23:38.375 --> 23:39.626
-No...
-Oh, thank God.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.462
So, have Hal help you find
something closer.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.381
-Oh, you moving closer?
-I'm not moving closer.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.092
Crazy to think that every word
did get invented.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.010
I-I have to go. Goodbye.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.680
-Wait, you're not playing Balderdash?
-No, I can't. Bye.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.932
Oh, Owen, come on, you love Balderdash.

23:54.015 --> 23:57.394
No, I don't fucking love Balderdash!
Balderdash is bullshit. [clears throat]

a roommate?

24:18.874 --> 24:19.708
No.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.337
I don't know why you won't let us
just buy you a place.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.131
That way you'd have more security.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.510
Or you... you could come and work
for the company.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.679
All your brothers do.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.683

24:54.201 --> 24:57.412
It's not an expectation, Owen,
it's a gift.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.750
You are giving your brother
the gift of an alibi.

You're protecting the family.

25:14.554 --> 25:19.935
I know, I know, it sounds muddled,
but that is the way reality works, Owen.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.895
-How's that, Dad?

25:21.978 --> 25:24.189

25:28.568 --> 25:30.987
Oh? What... what job?

25:31.780 --> 25:33.615
Business... marketing.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.869
It involves travel, so I'll be gone
a couple days next week,

25:37.953 --> 25:39.913
but I'll be back in time for the trial.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.123

25:44.334 --> 25:46.044
don't worry if you can't reach me.

That's... that's wonderful, Owen.
