00:22.800 --> 00:25.500
Welcome to the Toni Post show.
I am your host Toni Post.

00:25.701 --> 00:28.501
We love life.
I love life.

00:28.502 --> 00:30.802
I love life.
I love my job.

00:30.903 --> 00:32.402
You know why I love my job?

00:32.503 --> 00:34.803
Caus' I get to wake up each morning
and spend it with you.

00:34.804 --> 00:38.504
That's right.
And I mean that.

00:39.805 --> 00:43.105
We're going to talk about real things today.
We're going to talk about real people.

00:43.309 --> 00:44.376
We're going
to get down and dirty.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.777
And that's what makes it different.

00:46.178 --> 00:48.810
All right, let's start
with our first guest.

00:48.946 --> 00:51.642
- Connie Phillips from Chicago.
- Hi.

00:51.782 --> 00:54.808
We want to ask you
how you feel...

00:54.952 --> 00:57.318
about this friend
we've heard so much about.

00:57.421 --> 01:02.324
I'd walk through fire for her.
She's my best friend, you know?

01:02.493 --> 01:03.960
Best friend.

01:04.093 --> 01:08.029
And how long have you been
having sex with her husband?

01:08.164 --> 01:09.495
A little over a year.

01:11.634 --> 01:13.761
Well, he doesn't love her.
He loves me.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.395
Does she know why
she's appearing on our show?

01:18.007 --> 01:20.202
She thinks she's here
for a makeover.

01:22.177 --> 01:24.372
Ouch. That's got to hurt.

01:24.546 --> 01:27.606
I'm sure we're all wondering
why you chose...

01:27.749 --> 01:30.741
to reveal this to her
on national television.

01:30.886 --> 01:33.878
Because I want her to hear
my point of view.

01:34.022 --> 01:37.081
I really want her to hear me,
you know?

01:37.224 --> 01:39.215
Fair enough.
Let's bring her out.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.954
Let's bring out Birdee.
Give Birdee a hand.

01:45.699 --> 01:46.631
Hi, Birdee.

01:50.371 --> 01:55.330
- So tell us, how do you feel?
- I'm delightful, thank you.

01:55.508 --> 02:01.071
Do you recognize the voice of
the person sitting next to you?

02:01.180 --> 02:03.740
- Hi, Birdee.
- Connie?

02:03.917 --> 02:06.112
My... my best friend Connie?

02:06.219 --> 02:08.710
Absolutely correct.
Take off your blindfold.

02:09.854 --> 02:12.289
Oh, my God! Hi!

02:12.457 --> 02:15.324
Birdee,
Connie is your best friend?

02:15.460 --> 02:16.518
Yes, she is.

02:16.628 --> 02:18.994
She says she loves you
very much.

02:19.131 --> 02:22.191
Yeah. I love you, too.

02:22.334 --> 02:25.359
The last thing
she wants to do is hurt you.

02:28.939 --> 02:31.032
- Connie?
- Birdee...

02:33.944 --> 02:36.242
Billy and I are having
an affair.

02:36.346 --> 02:39.406
He doesn't love you anymore.
He wants to marry me.

02:50.292 --> 02:51.316
What? I...

02:51.493 --> 02:54.826
Your friendship is
very important to Connie.

02:54.930 --> 02:56.727
She loves you very much, Birdee.

02:58.767 --> 03:03.294
- You've been sleeping with him?
- Well, yeah.

03:03.438 --> 03:06.930
Actually, Connie told us
she had sex with Bill...

03:07.041 --> 03:09.202
in your home
on your living room floor.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.115
I want to hear
what Bill has to say. Do you?

03:16.249 --> 03:19.650
All right. Let's bring Bill in.
Come in, Bill. Join us.

03:21.922 --> 03:23.082
That's right.

03:24.891 --> 03:27.519
Come on, come on, come on.

03:27.694 --> 03:31.289
Bill, thank you for appearing
on the Toni Post Show.

03:31.431 --> 03:34.490
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Take off your blindfold.

03:39.839 --> 03:43.673
Bill, are you having an affair
with your wife's best friend?

03:56.521 --> 03:57.681
Yes, ma'am.

04:00.724 --> 04:04.091
All right. That's it.
We've got to take a break.

04:04.228 --> 04:08.095
We'll be back with some more
sizzle on the Toni Post Show.

04:28.150 --> 04:31.677
Bernice, did you get
my suitcase in the car?

04:31.820 --> 04:33.117
Yes.
Yeah, Mama.

04:33.255 --> 04:34.950
We'll be there in a few days.

04:38.826 --> 04:42.887
Well, if it's not
an... inconvenience.

04:49.303 --> 04:50.497
Oh...

04:52.473 --> 04:56.067
All right. Me, too. Bye-bye.

05:22.034 --> 05:25.094
Don't look back, sweetheart.
It's bad luck.

05:25.204 --> 05:28.297
Turn around.
Put on your seat belt.

05:41.017 --> 05:42.348
Take the wheel.

05:45.654 --> 05:48.987
Bernice, don't be a baby.
Just take the wheel.

05:49.091 --> 05:50.888
Come on. Come here.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.761
OK... thank you.

05:56.766 --> 05:57.994
Here we go.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.901
"Dear Princess,

06:08.042 --> 06:10.442
"I know you're confused now,
and I don't blame you.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.172
"None of this is your fault.

06:13.314 --> 06:15.407
"This is between
your mom and me.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.278
"Not a day will pass
when I won't think about you...

06:18.418 --> 06:19.783
"and wish you were with me.

06:19.887 --> 06:22.685
"I love you, honey.
Be nice to your mom.

06:22.856 --> 06:24.289
All my heart. Daddy."

06:41.407 --> 06:47.209
# Baby, baby,
I'm aware of where you go

06:49.081 --> 06:53.949
# Each time you leave my door

06:55.353 --> 06:59.722
# I watch you walk down the street

07:02.027 --> 07:07.623
# Knowing your other love
you're gonna meet

07:08.966 --> 07:14.232
# This time,
before you run to her

07:15.505 --> 07:20.374
# Leaving me alone and hurt

07:20.543 --> 07:23.010
# Think it over

07:23.111 --> 07:25.978
# Haven't I been good to you?

07:27.382 --> 07:30.579
# Think it over

07:30.719 --> 07:32.846
What's that funny smell?

07:32.988 --> 07:34.250
Cows.

07:34.389 --> 07:37.517
Is this where you were
Cream of Corn?

07:37.659 --> 07:40.991
Queen of Corn, honey,
three years running.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.363
A feat unsurpassed
in the history of Smithville.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.658
Oh.

07:46.701 --> 07:51.764
Maybe that was a long time ago,
but believe me, honey,

07:51.906 --> 07:54.841
once upon a time, your mama knew
what it meant to shine.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.909
# Before you break my heart

08:01.081 --> 08:01.775
# Think it over

08:02.115 --> 08:03.446
# Think it over

08:09.589 --> 08:14.184
Oh, you're here!
You're actually here!

08:14.293 --> 08:17.490
Oh, my baby. My babies!

08:17.663 --> 08:19.028
Bernice.
Look at me.

08:19.164 --> 08:22.497
You are so pretty! Oh...

08:25.037 --> 08:27.665
You look just like my mama,
you know that?

08:27.806 --> 08:29.204
- And Bird...
- Hey, Mama.

08:30.508 --> 08:34.467
- Birdee, you take up drinkin'?
- No, I have not. Go inside.

08:34.611 --> 08:37.945
You mean you're stone sober?
You look just awful.

08:38.049 --> 08:42.611
- Well, I... feel awful, Mama.
- Well, you look it.

08:43.621 --> 08:44.952
Well, I feel it.

08:45.789 --> 08:48.451
Well... you look it.

08:49.258 --> 08:50.691
Let me take one of those.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.226
I got a present for you.
Come on.

08:53.396 --> 08:55.261
Here, Mom.
Can't believe you're here.

08:56.432 --> 08:59.299
OK. Now...
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:00.436 --> 09:04.235
OK, that's a present
from your Grandpa and me.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.199
- How is Daddy?
- He's fine.

09:07.375 --> 09:10.503
He has a cold this week.
We can't see him till Saturday,

09:10.645 --> 09:14.081
but... he's, uh...
you know, he's fine.

09:14.182 --> 09:16.912
Good.
It's a bunny purse!

09:18.018 --> 09:19.713
You don't like stuffed animals?

09:19.853 --> 09:22.117
That's all right.
We'll get you settled first.

09:22.222 --> 09:26.158
But be very quiet.
We don't want to wake up Travis.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.952
You remember your cousin,
don't you?

09:28.062 --> 09:30.587
He got so excited waitin'
for y'all to arrive,

09:30.731 --> 09:31.993
he just pooped out.

09:35.501 --> 09:36.729
You see those?

09:37.937 --> 09:40.735
They're Scaredy-Cats.
You get it?

09:46.179 --> 09:49.114
Your Grandpa and I
made a fortune off of them.

09:49.248 --> 09:51.738
Birdee, lock the door.
You want to be murdered?

09:54.152 --> 09:57.280
Don't worry. If they bite you,
they got rubber teeth.

09:57.422 --> 10:01.290
- Did Grandma kill them herself?
- No. They come already dead.

10:03.996 --> 10:06.157
This way, they live forever.

10:06.298 --> 10:09.027
Scaredy-Cats.
Yeah, Scaredy-Cats.

10:12.870 --> 10:14.394
It's a nice room, isn't it?

10:16.207 --> 10:20.371
See that door? Leads right
into mine. Is that neat?

10:22.613 --> 10:26.775
OK... that about does it. Oh...

10:28.250 --> 10:29.615
Got a surprise for you.

10:33.055 --> 10:34.989
So you don't bump
into doors at night.

10:39.962 --> 10:44.421
- OK. Feet in. Arms in or out?
- Out.

10:44.599 --> 10:46.726
Oh. There you go.

10:49.771 --> 10:53.366
Snug as a bug in a rug.
Good night, baby.

11:32.510 --> 11:37.243
# Every night,
I dream you're next to me

11:39.784 --> 11:41.911
# Tenderly

11:43.822 --> 11:46.949
# You say my name

11:49.960 --> 11:54.363
# You know everybody's watchin' me

11:57.267 --> 11:59.201
# What they see...

12:00.737 --> 12:03.829
# Is me watching you

12:12.981 --> 12:15.006
Bad dog, Huckleby!
Bad dog!

12:16.651 --> 12:19.619
Bad dog.

12:19.753 --> 12:21.584
No.

12:22.890 --> 12:24.084
No, no.

12:27.394 --> 12:30.921
What a sweet dog, Mama!
You didn't say you had a pet.

12:31.031 --> 12:33.124
Hey, Travis. How are you?

12:34.435 --> 12:36.197
All right,
you're a boy again.

12:36.302 --> 12:38.133
Sit at the table
and eat breakfast.

12:38.271 --> 12:41.297
Better do what she says.

12:41.474 --> 12:45.069
Grandma stuffs bad little dogs.
Any calls?

12:45.211 --> 12:48.305
Any messages we get
will be on that bulletin board.

12:50.116 --> 12:51.674
All right, dig in here.

12:53.585 --> 12:56.076
There.
Bernice, this is Travis.

12:56.188 --> 12:58.452
He visited us in Chicago...
what was it?

12:59.691 --> 13:02.558
Two Christmases ago?

13:02.728 --> 13:04.593
He chewed my
Little House On the Prairie.

13:05.931 --> 13:07.728
Where's Aunt Desiree?

13:07.866 --> 13:12.325
Aunt Desiree's living in
Hollywood now. Right, Travis?

13:16.440 --> 13:20.035
- She's doing a pilot.
- Oh, really? And what's he like?

13:21.312 --> 13:24.179
- That's a show for television.
- Oh.

13:24.382 --> 13:26.713
Aunt Desiree's
gonna be on television?

13:26.816 --> 13:30.047
I was on TV, too.
Fat lot of good it did me.

13:30.187 --> 13:32.747
I am proud of both
of my television daughters.

13:34.891 --> 13:38.190
Birdee, you looked so beautiful
on that TV.

13:39.662 --> 13:42.186
- Everybody thought so.
- Who's everybody?

13:43.431 --> 13:45.797
Everybody in Smithville,
that's for sure.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.935
Honey, if you don't want
people to see you,

13:50.071 --> 13:51.629
why'd you go on television?

13:51.773 --> 13:56.836
Because I wanted
a free makeover, that's all.

13:56.978 --> 13:59.775
You got one. Just
a different kind, that's all.

14:02.149 --> 14:06.552
So, Bernice, what are
your plans? Stop that, Travis.

14:07.654 --> 14:11.215
- My name is Aunt Birdee.
- Well, stop that, Aunt Birdee.

14:11.358 --> 14:14.724
I don't know.
You should make some.

14:14.860 --> 14:17.385
You're starting
a whole new life here.

14:17.530 --> 14:19.327
Anything you wish is possible.

14:22.969 --> 14:24.197
Is that marmalade
over there?

14:24.370 --> 14:26.429
Oh, no... excuse me.

14:28.474 --> 14:29.873
Travis, I said stop it.

14:30.776 --> 14:33.642
If anything's possible,
like Grandma says,

14:33.812 --> 14:35.439
then I want more friends.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.172
What if they don't like me?

14:38.250 --> 14:44.587
Oh, Bernice, don't worry.
You're a likable girl.

14:44.723 --> 14:49.318
You are. You want more friends?
Is that what you're wishing for?

14:49.493 --> 14:51.188
Yeah, yeah... granted.

14:53.964 --> 14:55.795
Bernice, telephone.

15:02.906 --> 15:05.032
Bernice?
Hey, Daddy.

15:05.141 --> 15:06.574
I miss you so much.

15:20.188 --> 15:23.350
Daddy says hi.
He really misses me.

15:25.860 --> 15:27.293
I'm sure he does, sweetheart.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.969
I'm glad
you only missed six weeks here.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.903
I'm sure the Chicago schools
are way ahead of here.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.982
Keep it up! Keep it up!

15:50.116 --> 15:53.949
Keep that Tiger spirit up!
Say keep... it... up!

15:55.187 --> 15:58.156
Sure you don't want me
to pick you up after school?

15:58.290 --> 16:00.019
- I'll walk home with Travis.
- OK.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.394
Say keep... it... up!

16:04.263 --> 16:07.994
Keep it up! Keep it up!
Keep that Tiger spirit up!

16:08.133 --> 16:10.293
Say keep... it... up!

16:24.982 --> 16:27.848
It smells the same way...
peanut butter and paste.

16:27.984 --> 16:30.350
Can you smell it? Huh?

16:30.520 --> 16:33.387
All right, you look perfect.
You ready?

16:35.759 --> 16:38.091
Maybe I could go in alone.

16:38.195 --> 16:41.722
Hmm. Show 'em you're
the independent type, huh?

16:42.998 --> 16:46.229
Yeah. You're gonna do great.

16:46.369 --> 16:48.837
- Mm-hmm.
- Go knock 'em dead.

16:48.971 --> 16:50.097
- OK.
- OK?

16:50.239 --> 16:51.865
- Bye, Mom.
- Hey.

16:52.006 --> 16:54.406
Come back here.
What's the matter with you?

16:54.542 --> 16:55.839
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Baby.

16:59.246 --> 17:01.737
Yes, that's correct, Harry.

17:01.882 --> 17:03.975
"Gave me a turtle."

17:04.117 --> 17:07.144
OK, "He drunk that water fast."
Brandy.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.117
"He drank that water fast."

17:09.223 --> 17:14.455
Very good.
"He drank that water fast."

17:14.627 --> 17:16.992
That's the correct answer.
Very good.

17:17.130 --> 17:20.531
OK, Bernice.
Class, this is Bernice Pruitt.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.531
Bernice comes to us
from Chicago.

17:24.804 --> 17:28.672
Take the desk next to Kirsten.
That'll be your seat. Kirsten?

17:29.776 --> 17:31.368
Go on, honey.

17:31.544 --> 17:36.742
Class, let's open up your books
to page 76, chapter three.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.408
Pay attention,
'cause there's a quiz on Monday.

17:39.584 --> 17:41.552
She's got pop-eyes.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.889
Bernice,
follow along with Kirsten, OK?

17:51.695 --> 17:55.222
I didn't do anything.
Why is it always my fault?

17:56.100 --> 17:57.567
I didn't say anything
about fault.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.295
I just asked what you did,
that's all.

18:00.438 --> 18:04.033
Nothing. People fall in love,
they fall right back out.

18:04.175 --> 18:06.108
Happens all the time.

18:06.242 --> 18:08.710
You never told me
you were having trouble.

18:10.713 --> 18:13.181
Maybe I didn't want to hear,
"I told you so."

18:15.385 --> 18:17.410
Besides,
how could we have trouble?

18:18.955 --> 18:22.355
Prom queen. Quarterback.
Pride of Smithville.

18:22.491 --> 18:24.186
Practically left town
on a float.

18:26.728 --> 18:28.251
Maybe you were special.

18:28.396 --> 18:32.696
Then again, maybe you're
just like the rest of us,

18:32.834 --> 18:36.600
except you were riding around
on flowers made of toilet paper.

18:37.872 --> 18:41.602
- You just never liked Bill.
- I like all of God's creatures.

18:41.741 --> 18:44.676
I just like some of them better
stuffed, and he's one of 'em.

18:45.745 --> 18:49.340
Just cut to the part
where he started fooling around.

18:55.654 --> 18:58.589
Well, at cocktail parties,

18:58.724 --> 19:03.661
the women that Bill worked with
would never look at me.

19:05.865 --> 19:07.526
Their eyes were always
surveying the room,

19:07.666 --> 19:10.260
looking for somebody better
to talk to.

19:13.605 --> 19:16.665
I was just a beauty queen
from Smithville. I was a joke.

19:16.808 --> 19:20.300
- That's it.
- No. You were never a joke.

19:23.047 --> 19:24.378
Yeah, I was, Mama.

19:25.650 --> 19:27.947
You could see it in his eyes.

19:39.830 --> 19:44.061
Honey, crying over it
won't make it clean.

19:45.968 --> 19:49.563
Life just goes on, and you got
to move along with it.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.804
Yeah.

19:56.812 --> 19:58.245
- Bud.
- Weiser.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.079
- How's your dinner, Kermit?
- Good.

20:03.018 --> 20:05.986
We seem to be
the only ones enjoying it.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.349
You ever see two such mopes?

20:08.489 --> 20:11.356
That's a mope,
and that's a mope.

20:11.525 --> 20:14.050
- All right, Mama.
- No, it isn't all right.

20:14.194 --> 20:19.460
Look at me. My life has no big
meaning or direction or purpose,

20:19.632 --> 20:20.792
and I'm happy.

20:22.035 --> 20:25.903
Look at Kermit here.
You think it's easy being green?

20:28.474 --> 20:29.338
Ribbit.

20:30.810 --> 20:33.334
I saw that, Bernice. That smile
means there's hope for you.

20:34.713 --> 20:35.304
I saw that, Bernice. That smile
means there's hope for you.

20:36.682 --> 20:37.944
I got it!

20:41.053 --> 20:42.816
You expecting someone?

20:42.955 --> 20:45.947
No. I mean,
it might be Justin Matisse.

20:46.091 --> 20:49.083
He said he might drop over
after his day job.

20:49.227 --> 20:51.490
He's helping me fix the porch.

20:51.629 --> 20:54.189
I don't want to see him.
Hi, Travis.

20:54.332 --> 20:56.197
Why?
'Cause your hair's not fixed?

20:56.400 --> 20:59.096
- He's back from California.
- So what?

20:59.203 --> 21:01.569
- And... Justin, come on in!
- Mama.

21:08.878 --> 21:10.869
Hey... Justin.

21:11.014 --> 21:15.246
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Birdee Calvert.

21:15.385 --> 21:18.479
- It's Pruitt. Birdee Pruitt.
- Sorry.

21:20.256 --> 21:21.280
It's all right.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.250
Birdee, Birdee, Birdee.

21:25.961 --> 21:29.727
- Move on to something else.
- I heard you'd come back.

21:31.133 --> 21:32.395
Wonder how.

21:34.370 --> 21:39.034
- This is my daughter Bernice.
- Bernice, Bernice, Bernice.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.231
That's funny.

21:42.142 --> 21:45.339
- You smell delicious, Justin.
- Thanks.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.208
- You wearing cologne?
- No, that's...

21:49.282 --> 21:52.149
A little paint thinner
with sweat mixed in with it.

21:52.319 --> 21:56.049
Ha ha! It sure smells
good, doesn't it, Birdee?

21:57.289 --> 22:01.055
Go out on the porch, and Birdee
will bring you some iced tea.

22:01.193 --> 22:03.058
That sounds great. Thank you.

22:03.229 --> 22:04.491
Bye, y'all.
Bye.

22:04.664 --> 22:06.791
Bye, Bernice-Bernice-Bernice.

22:06.899 --> 22:09.561
Great to see you, Birdee.
You look good.

22:18.943 --> 22:20.103
Here.

22:21.780 --> 22:22.940
Oh, hey, Bernice.

22:24.516 --> 22:25.676
Thank you.

22:26.718 --> 22:29.083
There's no glass
for your mother.

22:29.219 --> 22:30.743
She went upstairs.

22:30.888 --> 22:33.721
My daddy usually calls
for one of his daily chats,

22:33.857 --> 22:35.222
and then we all turn in.

22:35.392 --> 22:39.795
I see. So, how do you like it
down here in Smithville?

22:39.897 --> 22:43.060
It wasn't on any maps
until we got to Texas.

22:44.868 --> 22:47.631
We like to keep it a secret.

22:47.770 --> 22:49.635
That way, it doesn't get
overrun with people.

22:49.806 --> 22:51.296
Seems to be working.

22:53.376 --> 22:58.177
- Your mother and I go way back.
- I know. You must.

23:00.183 --> 23:04.915
Back home, we had a pet skunk.
Mom called it Justin Matisse.

23:05.053 --> 23:06.520
You think that's a coincidence?

23:08.223 --> 23:11.989
All day long, Mom would scream,
"You stink, Justin Matisse!"

23:12.127 --> 23:14.527
Finally, she just
picked up a club and killed it.

23:16.131 --> 23:18.290
That's a sad story.

23:18.465 --> 23:21.457
If you liked the skunk,
which we didn't.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.092
She still has that club
in her purse upstairs.

23:26.106 --> 23:28.574
I guess that means
she's not coming down.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.107
Not until you leave.

23:32.679 --> 23:37.206
Guess I better go, then.
Thanks for packing up my stuff.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.517
I'll see you around. That's
what's great about a small town.

23:55.933 --> 23:56.991
Birdee!

23:59.537 --> 24:03.268
What, Mama?
Can you give me a hand?

24:18.321 --> 24:20.687
Huh? What? Ma... Mama.

24:20.824 --> 24:23.951
Oh, honey,
are you still in here?

24:24.059 --> 24:25.686
I had no idea.

24:27.163 --> 24:30.098
It's a beautiful day out.
Take a look at it.

24:30.232 --> 24:32.462
- Oh...
- Go on.

24:32.635 --> 24:35.729
Get out there.
Get the stink blown off ya.

24:35.871 --> 24:38.999
- I always hated that expression.
- Don't make me use it, then.

24:39.141 --> 24:41.301
I'm gonna turn
the shower on for you.

24:41.476 --> 24:43.910
I'm going shopping later,
if you want to get out.

25:11.904 --> 25:12.996
Mama!

25:14.306 --> 25:15.671
Mama!

25:16.808 --> 25:21.939
Mama, can't this... Mama! Mama!
Mother! Justin. Hey.

25:23.715 --> 25:26.377
- What are you doing up here?
- Building shelves.

25:27.719 --> 25:31.381
You look terrible.
You been drinkin', huh?

25:32.623 --> 25:35.057
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

25:35.159 --> 25:39.858
Is there a coaster stuck
to my butt or something?

25:40.030 --> 25:42.430
- How long will this take?
- A couple hours.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.335
Go down and get dressed.
You'll feel better.

25:47.470 --> 25:49.301
You must feel depressed,
looking like that.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.601
Do you always say what's on your
mind, or is this my lucky day?

25:54.744 --> 25:56.871
I won't do you any favors
by lying.

25:57.013 --> 26:00.779
I don't need your favors.
All right?

26:00.917 --> 26:04.249
- I just need... something.
- Is that an invitation?

26:06.421 --> 26:07.945
Bye.
Bye.

26:15.364 --> 26:17.229
Remember the blue beetle?

26:17.366 --> 26:19.060
It promised us a long,
happy life.

26:33.647 --> 26:34.773
Forget it.

26:39.385 --> 26:41.876
Hansel and Gretel's mom
was terrible.

26:42.021 --> 26:46.515
Why didn't the witch eat her?
You didn't tell the story right.

26:46.659 --> 26:51.494
Your mama's gonna come get you
as soon as she can. I promise.

26:51.664 --> 26:54.723
And stop pickin' at that doll's
eyes. That makes me nervous.

26:54.866 --> 26:56.026
Bernice!

26:57.502 --> 26:59.970
Bernice! Come here.

27:00.071 --> 27:02.938
What do you think you're doing?
Do you think I'm stupid?

27:03.074 --> 27:04.200
What's the matter?

27:04.375 --> 27:06.138
What do you think
you're doing?

27:06.277 --> 27:07.437
What did I do?

27:07.578 --> 27:09.340
If you have
something to say,

27:09.479 --> 27:12.141
say it flat out,
don't say it behind my back!

27:12.916 --> 27:14.713
- You have something to tell me?
- No.

27:14.851 --> 27:16.546
- Tell me!
- What should I say?

27:16.687 --> 27:19.417
Stop playing innocent!
I know what you told him!

27:19.556 --> 27:21.023
- Told who?
- Your father, Bernice!

27:21.158 --> 27:23.558
I just got off the phone
with him.

27:23.694 --> 27:25.991
He said, "I'm sorry
you're taking this so hard.

27:26.128 --> 27:29.529
Sorry you can't get out of bed,
but we have a daughter."

27:29.665 --> 27:32.133
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing. It wasn't bad.

27:32.301 --> 27:34.496
I just said you were sad.
We both are.

27:34.637 --> 27:37.299
That is our business!
That's not his business!

27:37.440 --> 27:39.169
We're not sad! We're fine!

27:39.308 --> 27:42.140
We're not! You don't care about
me, don't ask me about school.

27:42.243 --> 27:45.371
You don't make breakfast for me.
You said you'd take care of me!

27:45.547 --> 27:48.812
I promised Daddy?
Daddy promised me the world,

27:48.950 --> 27:50.815
and Daddy didn't honor
his promise,

27:50.986 --> 27:53.352
and I will break every promise
I make to him!

27:53.488 --> 27:55.456
Birdee, stop it!
That's enough, now.

27:57.025 --> 28:00.016
It is not a crime to tell
the truth... not in this house.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.628
- Don't yell at her!
- She's my daughter.

28:02.763 --> 28:06.756
I'll yell at her all I want.
Just take a look at yourself.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.391
Wandering around night and day
in your bathrobe?

28:10.570 --> 28:12.868
You're hiding out.
You're scared.

28:12.972 --> 28:14.461
Lord, what happened to you?

28:16.375 --> 28:21.369
- You used to be so pleasing.
- I had to be pleasing, Mama.

28:22.514 --> 28:25.176
With the town joke as a mother,
I had to be.

28:25.317 --> 28:29.515
When you'd flounce into school
with your road-kill hat...

28:29.654 --> 28:33.487
and your freshly skinned bag,
I learned how to be pleasing.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.923
You're pleasing nobody.
You're miserable yourself.

28:37.061 --> 28:40.690
And I've never been unhappy,
so the joke is on you, honey.

28:41.699 --> 28:44.759
- Don't yell at her!
- I'm finished, believe me.

28:46.103 --> 28:48.070
Come on out here, Travis.

29:09.425 --> 29:11.154
I didn't hurt you, did I?

29:16.598 --> 29:19.032
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.

29:25.173 --> 29:28.404
- That's OK. Night, Travis.
- Good night.

29:57.435 --> 30:00.302
We got a beautiful day
going in the Austin area,

30:00.438 --> 30:03.566
and all your favorites
on your oldies station,

30:03.708 --> 30:05.141
playing all the good ones.

30:05.310 --> 30:07.710
Excuse me.
You'll like this one.

30:07.812 --> 30:11.611
Birdee! Birdee Calvert! Oh!

30:12.649 --> 30:16.244
- I heard you were back in town!
- Hello.

30:16.386 --> 30:17.876
Debbie. Debbie Reissen.

30:19.790 --> 30:22.623
- Debbie Reissen!
- How are you?

30:22.759 --> 30:26.353
- How are you?
- Did you come to see Dot?

30:26.496 --> 30:28.930
- Dot?
- She runs the whole office now.

30:29.765 --> 30:32.097
Oh, yeah, I came to see Dot.

30:32.201 --> 30:34.692
- She'll be so tickled!
- Oh, great.

30:36.639 --> 30:39.699
Dottie, in a million years,
you'll never guess who came...

30:39.842 --> 30:42.810
all the way from Chicago
to see you!

30:42.944 --> 30:44.536
Take me off the intercom.

30:50.619 --> 30:53.884
She guessed.
Would you like to have a seat?

30:54.823 --> 30:57.018
- Great. Thank you.
- She'll be right with you.

31:03.898 --> 31:07.356
- I saw you on television.
- Really?

31:07.501 --> 31:10.561
- I taped it.
- Yeah.

31:18.478 --> 31:20.342
Birdee, come on in.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.209
No calls, Deborah.

31:23.348 --> 31:24.747
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.752
- I didn't keep you too long?
- It's fine, thank you.

31:36.894 --> 31:40.022
You look beautiful.
Same old Birdee.

31:41.832 --> 31:43.129
Same old Dot.

31:48.505 --> 31:51.030
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

31:53.510 --> 31:57.310
- No. Sorry. I don't.
- It's all right.

31:59.149 --> 32:01.379
When I knew you,
I was five inches shorter...

32:01.551 --> 32:03.212
and 70 pounds heavier.

32:04.621 --> 32:06.451
We didn't eat at the same table.

32:07.656 --> 32:08.953
Polka Dot?

32:09.091 --> 32:12.652
Oh!
Is that right?

32:12.795 --> 32:17.095
Yeah. Nobody's called me that
in a long time.

32:17.233 --> 32:21.532
- Oh, my God! You look fantastic!
- Thank you.

32:21.669 --> 32:23.432
- You're welcome.
- Have a seat.

32:25.039 --> 32:28.372
Oh, my God!
I mean, it's remarkable.

32:28.543 --> 32:30.511
Was I really
that terrible before?

32:30.645 --> 32:33.842
- Oh, no, no, I just meant...
- I know what you meant.

32:34.916 --> 32:37.907
People change.
We get better as we get older.

32:38.051 --> 32:41.680
- Yeah.
- You look exactly the same.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.181
- Well, no. Actually, I have a...
- Oh, I know.

32:46.326 --> 32:48.886
- I heard about you and Bill.
- Yeah.

32:49.029 --> 32:50.860
He always was a ladies' man.

32:53.333 --> 32:57.165
- You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

32:57.269 --> 33:03.606
So much of that's staged for TV.
For ratings and... yeah.

33:06.578 --> 33:11.378
So... you need a job. What sort
of work have you been doing?

33:11.515 --> 33:15.679
Um, housework. Bill worked,
and he didn't want...

33:16.487 --> 33:18.921
We have a daughter,
so I took care of her.

33:20.090 --> 33:25.619
- OK. How fast do you type?
- Don't type.

33:28.765 --> 33:31.290
OK. Computer skills?

33:33.169 --> 33:34.397
Don't compute.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.634
Oh, goodness.
You'll have to give me...

33:38.808 --> 33:40.969
some sort of idea
of what you're looking for,

33:41.077 --> 33:43.943
'cause I'm not likely to find
a listing for prom queen.

33:46.114 --> 33:51.211
Well... I used to take pictures.
I was good at that.

33:51.386 --> 33:54.583
So maybe I could get a job
at the newspaper...

33:54.723 --> 33:57.692
or Jackson's portrait studio.

33:57.826 --> 34:00.953
It's closed down,
and the newspaper's not hiring.

34:01.095 --> 34:03.120
- I can tell you that right now.
- OK.

34:04.632 --> 34:11.094
- So... hmm.
- Dot, I would really like a job.

34:13.107 --> 34:15.405
One that I could
like myself for.

34:16.543 --> 34:19.170
Even if it's just
for a little while.

34:19.312 --> 34:20.609
- Birdee...
- Dot...

34:24.351 --> 34:27.752
I don't know how I treated you
in high school.

34:30.824 --> 34:34.656
I'm guessing it was pretty bad,

34:34.792 --> 34:38.728
seeing how you're hell-bent
on putting me in my place.

34:40.531 --> 34:41.759
And that's OK.

34:43.501 --> 34:49.030
Just, um...
just put me in a job, too.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.998
I would really be grateful.

35:01.084 --> 35:02.312
Well...

35:07.456 --> 35:09.390
Shoot some pictures
over the weekend.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.720
- OK. Great.
- I'll look 'em over.

35:11.861 --> 35:13.624
- Great.
- I'll do what I can.

35:14.930 --> 35:16.454
Thank you. Thank you.

35:27.942 --> 35:30.206
- Enjoy your food, honey.
- Thanks.

35:35.183 --> 35:39.050
It's not for sissies,
you know... dining alone.

35:42.556 --> 35:45.389
Got to be made of
some stern stuff to do that.

35:45.559 --> 35:46.651
Really.

35:47.828 --> 35:49.762
The trick is
to seem mysterious.

35:52.466 --> 35:53.899
Like the choice is yours.

36:00.973 --> 36:04.909
- Impressive.
- Well, you pick these things up.

36:12.516 --> 36:13.813
Care to join me?

36:18.689 --> 36:22.386
Can't do that.
That'd be cheating.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.723
- Oh.
- Besides, I'd rather wait.

36:30.433 --> 36:31.957
Well, I got to go.

36:33.570 --> 36:36.004
Remember, mysterious.
That's the key.

36:36.105 --> 36:37.868
- OK.
- Oh...

36:39.609 --> 36:43.739
Maybe, um... order some dessert
just to spite 'em.

36:45.347 --> 36:47.008
- All right.
- Make me proud.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.095
- Keep the change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:05.800 --> 37:11.602
# Smile
though your heart is aching

37:13.274 --> 37:17.903
# Smile even though it's breaking

37:20.380 --> 37:28.913
# When there are clouds
in the sky, you'll get by

37:30.023 --> 37:36.291
# If you smile
through your fears and sorrow

37:37.830 --> 37:42.824
# Smile, and maybe tomorrow

37:45.604 --> 37:50.904
# You'll see the sun
come shining through

37:52.643 --> 37:59.515
# You just smile

37:59.650 --> 38:01.675
These are good.
Really?

38:03.987 --> 38:08.514
- Really.
- Can you find something for me?

38:11.827 --> 38:14.295
- Think I can.
- Oh...

38:15.798 --> 38:17.026
Great. Thanks.

38:18.301 --> 38:20.326
Then you take the film,
like so,

38:20.469 --> 38:22.869
and you run it through here.

38:24.072 --> 38:27.200
- Make sure this is shut tight.
- OK.

38:27.375 --> 38:29.468
Then you just follow it along,
like so.

38:30.545 --> 38:34.777
Then it comes out here, like so.
Then you separate it.

38:34.916 --> 38:36.781
- Like... so.
- That's right.

38:37.886 --> 38:41.412
Everyone's film has to be
developed in less than an hour.

38:41.589 --> 38:42.954
Otherwise, it's free.

38:43.057 --> 38:45.048
- Any questions?
- Nope.

38:46.427 --> 38:50.625
Occasionally, we get pictures of
a somewhat questionable nature.

38:51.632 --> 38:54.328
- Naked pictures?
- We never comment on them.

38:54.468 --> 38:57.334
We just hand them over
as if we hadn't seen a thing.

38:58.204 --> 38:59.398
I understand, Mr. Davis.

38:59.539 --> 39:03.498
But first, we make a copy.
We put them under the counter.

39:04.277 --> 39:08.407
You can have a look anytime you
want, just don't take them home.

39:08.548 --> 39:11.210
- All right.
- You can sit down right there.

39:12.285 --> 39:14.912
- OK.
- Birdee Calvert!

39:16.288 --> 39:20.588
I bet the customers will
stand in line to see you again!

39:37.741 --> 39:40.369
We have a full range
of arts and crafts...

39:40.543 --> 39:42.408
to keep our loved ones happy.

39:42.545 --> 39:46.810
It's like summer camp, only
it's all year round. Lucky them.

39:48.283 --> 39:50.513
Charlie, let's go...
Here we are.

39:50.653 --> 39:53.019
Harry...
Look who's here!

39:53.122 --> 39:55.488
Told you she was coming.
All these visitors!

39:55.658 --> 39:59.651
- Oh... so good to see you.
- Well, enjoy.

40:01.397 --> 40:05.162
Oh...
How you keepin', Daddy?

40:06.300 --> 40:09.895
- What's wrong with him?
- It's just a stroke.

40:10.004 --> 40:13.496
And a little old-timers.
She means Alzheimer's.

40:13.641 --> 40:15.040
I know what I mean.

40:16.511 --> 40:19.877
You know exactly what's
going on, Daddy. Yeah.

40:21.148 --> 40:24.879
- Thank him for the bunny.
- He doesn't even know who I am.

40:25.018 --> 40:28.954
Sure he does. It's just hard
for him to show it.

40:29.089 --> 40:31.080
- Say hello.
- Uh-uh.

40:31.224 --> 40:32.486
Sure, go ahead.

40:34.494 --> 40:36.427
Travis, you want
to kiss your grandpa?

40:39.699 --> 40:42.668
I think we need
a little ice cream.

40:42.802 --> 40:44.030
That's a great idea.

40:44.170 --> 40:46.695
Let's let Mama and Grandpa
have some time together.

40:46.839 --> 40:49.103
- We'll be in the cafeteria.
- You'll be OK?

40:49.241 --> 40:50.401
We're fine.

40:51.910 --> 40:52.968
So...

40:56.448 --> 41:00.349
I'll tell you one thing,
I won't sit here and tell you...

41:00.484 --> 41:03.885
what a nice place we got you in
or how good you look.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.620
'Cause we're adults, right?

41:09.959 --> 41:11.221
At least, you are.

41:14.097 --> 41:17.260
Mama says you do that
blinking thing with your eyes.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.368
One blink for yes, two for no.
Can you do that?

41:21.771 --> 41:22.863
Hmm?

41:24.073 --> 41:26.506
Just on your good day, huh?
I get it.

41:32.447 --> 41:33.812
That was Bernice, Daddy.

41:35.417 --> 41:37.282
You remember Bernice?

41:42.923 --> 41:44.288
Hmm... there it is.

41:49.230 --> 41:50.720
That's Bernice, Daddy.

41:56.070 --> 41:58.867
She's the best thing
I ever did.

41:59.005 --> 42:01.132
I wish Bill could be here,

42:01.307 --> 42:05.243
but, um... we're having
a little bit of trouble.

42:09.382 --> 42:10.644
But enough of that.

42:12.819 --> 42:16.447
I'm going to write her name
right down here...

42:17.589 --> 42:18.988
...on the bottom of her picture.

42:21.326 --> 42:25.262
When she comes back here,
maybe you could recognize her...

42:25.397 --> 42:28.594
and give her a little sign
or something.

42:28.700 --> 42:30.395
She could use one, you know?

42:36.273 --> 42:37.433
What, Daddy?

42:41.812 --> 42:45.145
# Chances are I'll see you

42:45.282 --> 42:49.115
# Somewhere in my dreams tonight

42:51.353 --> 42:56.450
# I recall your laughter
and your smile

43:00.462 --> 43:08.300
# I remember how
you made me feel so at ease

43:09.804 --> 43:16.039
# I remember all your grace,
your style

43:23.750 --> 43:27.083
# Chances are I'll hold you

43:27.254 --> 43:31.657
# And I'll offer all I have

43:33.260 --> 43:39.095
# You're the only one
I can't forget

43:44.637 --> 43:48.038
# You're the best I've ever met

43:49.442 --> 43:51.103
You don't have
a daddy, either.

43:53.311 --> 43:55.245
Don't break that.
I've had it forever.

43:57.215 --> 43:58.409
Come on. It's late.

44:02.487 --> 44:03.681
There you go.

44:05.156 --> 44:09.320
My little burrito baby.
Snug as a bug in a rug.

44:09.493 --> 44:11.586
You're out of luck
if your nose itches.

44:11.695 --> 44:13.059
- Good night.
- Night, Mom.

44:24.807 --> 44:27.866
Well, if it isn't
Birdee Calvert.

44:28.010 --> 44:30.205
Bobbi-Claire Akins.

44:30.345 --> 44:32.813
- Patterson now.
- Oh, great!

44:32.948 --> 44:36.748
How are you?
I heard about your sad news.

44:36.885 --> 44:39.479
How Bill could
humiliate you like that...

44:39.621 --> 44:42.953
in front of the entire world
is just beyond me.

44:43.090 --> 44:46.924
We have a satellite dish,
so we got to see it twice.

44:47.094 --> 44:49.892
- You poor thing.
- What can I do for you?

44:50.031 --> 44:55.469
Anyway, I brought you these.
My sister's wedding reception.

44:55.636 --> 44:58.230
Triple prints, please. I'll
come back after my hair's done.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.204
I love this thing
you're doing with your hair.

45:02.342 --> 45:06.676
It's so... down-to-earth
and natural-like.

45:06.813 --> 45:08.974
I wish I could be
more like that.

45:10.350 --> 45:11.977
I'm fearless that way.

45:32.337 --> 45:34.271
Oh... no!

45:34.405 --> 45:35.667
No, no, no!

45:36.841 --> 45:41.301
No! No! What's the matter
with you, you piece of crap?

45:41.446 --> 45:42.572
Oh, crap.

45:44.015 --> 45:45.141
Mr. Davis!

45:46.417 --> 45:50.010
- I'm sorry, Bobbi-Claire.
- Sorry?

45:50.152 --> 45:53.644
You think that does it? These
pictures were irreplaceable!

45:53.789 --> 45:57.885
- When I was loading the paper...
- Look! There's nothin'!

45:58.027 --> 46:00.621
There's not a blur,
not a face with red eyes!

46:00.763 --> 46:02.628
You think Debbie-Lynn
gets married every day?

46:02.798 --> 46:05.197
Debbie-Lynn?
Isn't this her fourth or...

46:05.367 --> 46:08.165
It is her fifth,
Miss High-and-Mighty,

46:08.303 --> 46:10.737
but they each had
very different themes.

46:10.872 --> 46:12.567
Now there's nothing
to show for it!

46:13.508 --> 46:16.944
At least I caught it before
the other ones got ruined.

46:17.078 --> 46:20.445
Oh, yes. You are just little
Miss Employee of the Month.

46:20.582 --> 46:24.517
Mr. Davis, I hope you make sure
that this never happens again,

46:24.651 --> 46:26.619
and I believe
you know what I mean.

46:29.123 --> 46:30.249
What?

46:34.328 --> 46:37.491
Oh, dear.
Am I gonna have to fire you?

46:38.398 --> 46:39.592
She'll cool off.

46:39.732 --> 46:43.065
It must be hard carrying around
all that hair, you know?

46:44.771 --> 46:49.174
Well, if she sends a bill,
I'll have to dock you, Birdee,

46:49.308 --> 46:50.775
for at least half.

46:50.910 --> 46:52.571
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

46:52.712 --> 46:54.474
Let's get this back on-line.

46:56.014 --> 46:58.539
- Go get back on-line.
- Shut up.

47:02.254 --> 47:04.814
You were the first girl
I ever kissed.

47:04.923 --> 47:06.151
I knew that.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.792
Playing spin-the-bottle.
Yep.

47:08.894 --> 47:11.225
And you stuck
your tongue in my mouth.

47:11.395 --> 47:14.796
I didn't know you were supposed
to do that. I was mortified.

47:14.932 --> 47:16.490
Thought you were an epileptic,

47:16.634 --> 47:17.965
so I went home and told Mama
you had a seizure in my mouth.

47:21.539 --> 47:23.939
I was over the moon for you
back then, Birdee.

47:24.942 --> 47:27.204
- You knew that.
- No, I didn't.

47:29.878 --> 47:32.472
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Coward.

47:32.614 --> 47:35.412
- Chicken?
- Chicken, pure and simple.

47:36.452 --> 47:39.580
You and Bill were up here.
I was somewhere else.

47:40.823 --> 47:42.654
What if I'd asked you out?

47:45.393 --> 47:47.418
I don't know
what I would have said.

47:47.562 --> 47:49.792
I'm not the same person
I was back then.

47:51.866 --> 47:53.561
What if I asked you out now?

47:57.839 --> 47:59.136
Is that what you're doin'?

48:00.874 --> 48:02.136
That's what I'm doin'.

48:07.214 --> 48:08.772
I would have to say no.

48:14.421 --> 48:17.617
I'm a married woman.
What's the matter with you?

48:17.756 --> 48:21.089
Not on a date, though.
Just dinner.

48:22.695 --> 48:26.324
- Married people eat, right?
- I don't know. I don't know.

48:26.465 --> 48:29.127
What about I take you out
for a great fish dinner?

48:33.037 --> 48:35.130
I'm glad
we're not having steak.

48:35.306 --> 48:37.536
I'm a little rusty
at roping steer.

48:37.642 --> 48:39.633
You're not so hot
at this, either.

48:41.779 --> 48:42.973
Relax, Birdee.

48:45.416 --> 48:48.852
Just sit back
and let the fish come to you.

48:50.287 --> 48:51.879
You know who'd love this?
Bernice.

48:51.989 --> 48:54.514
Hey... breathe.

48:55.459 --> 48:56.687
I'm breathing.

48:58.095 --> 48:59.187
Just listen.

49:07.369 --> 49:10.861
- So what have you been doing...
- It kills you to be quiet.

49:13.842 --> 49:16.072
It kills you to answer
a personal question.

49:20.682 --> 49:21.944
I went to California.

49:29.323 --> 49:30.620
You didn't like it?

49:34.862 --> 49:36.227
I'm here, ain't I?

49:38.299 --> 49:40.528
Yes, you are.
Yes, I am.

49:49.108 --> 49:51.099
You know those people
who publish calendars?

49:51.277 --> 49:54.735
- Uh-huh.
- They'd love your pictures.

49:57.950 --> 50:01.784
So I like pretty pictures.
That's who I am.

50:03.155 --> 50:05.487
You don't get voted most popular
and best smile...

50:05.657 --> 50:07.522
if you have an edge.

50:07.659 --> 50:09.126
You do have a great smile.

50:14.332 --> 50:15.299
Don't show it to me.

50:19.570 --> 50:20.730
Come here.

50:23.808 --> 50:27.266
Hey. Come sit by me.

50:35.552 --> 50:36.985
- Want to help?
- Nope.

50:39.588 --> 50:41.180
- Don't smile, now.
- I'm not.

50:44.426 --> 50:47.724
Let's see his smile.
He's got a great smile.

50:47.862 --> 50:49.056
Hold on.

50:50.732 --> 50:52.893
He won best smile
in his school. Get it?

51:00.708 --> 51:02.106
Hit the ball, Popeye.

51:17.790 --> 51:19.519
Big Dolores!

51:27.833 --> 51:31.030
Can't you do this in the
backyard? It's embarrassing.

51:31.170 --> 51:35.333
Ha ha! Honey, they're dead.
How can they be embarrassed?

51:36.941 --> 51:39.341
I hated this
when I was your age.

51:39.511 --> 51:41.604
One day,
all this will be yours.

51:42.747 --> 51:45.375
Hey, what's wrong?
How was school?

51:46.618 --> 51:48.085
Fine.
Nah-ah!

51:48.253 --> 51:50.380
Big Dolores
is gonna murder Bernice.

51:51.555 --> 51:54.353
- Quiet, Travis.
- Who's Big Dolores?

51:54.491 --> 51:57.688
She's the meanest,
dumbest girl in school,

51:57.828 --> 52:01.992
but she keeps passing 'cause
even teachers are afraid of her.

52:02.132 --> 52:06.398
She has her own gang, too.
It's called... Big Dolores.

52:08.137 --> 52:09.695
What's she got against Bernice?

52:09.839 --> 52:13.206
Bernice hit her in the face
with a volleyball...

52:13.376 --> 52:15.639
in front of the whole school.

52:15.777 --> 52:18.007
Now Bernice is gonna die.

52:18.113 --> 52:20.911
Did you hit somebody in the face
with a volleyball?

52:21.083 --> 52:23.516
- It was an accident.
- Did you say you were sorry?

52:24.652 --> 52:26.381
She'll kill me anyway.

52:26.520 --> 52:30.149
That whole family's no good.
I think it's glandular.

52:30.324 --> 52:32.884
Whatever gland produces
meanness, they got it.

52:32.993 --> 52:34.927
Mama, nobody's
gonna kill anybody.

52:35.062 --> 52:37.622
I'll just have a talk
with her mother,

52:37.765 --> 52:39.130
and we'll iron everything out.

52:39.300 --> 52:42.097
Don't talk with her mother.
I'd rather die.

52:42.235 --> 52:45.033
- Don't worry. You will.
- Travis?

52:45.138 --> 52:47.504
Travis, come down here
and be a tree.

52:47.674 --> 52:50.643
Travis, come here.
Go be a tree.

52:50.777 --> 52:53.644
Mom, promise me you won't
have a talk with her mother.

52:53.780 --> 52:55.907
They'd really have it in
for me after that.

52:56.049 --> 52:58.608
Don't be so dramatic.
Nothing's gonna happen.

52:59.685 --> 53:02.085
You're right, Mom.
It'll be a normal day.

53:02.254 --> 53:03.778
Oh, yes.

53:07.659 --> 53:09.752
Old Man Linton's
make-out spot.

53:09.895 --> 53:12.022
I thought we were going out
for ice cream.

53:12.197 --> 53:14.061
What would your mother say?

53:14.232 --> 53:16.632
She'd probably say,
"Way to go, Justin."

53:16.768 --> 53:18.065
Really.
Yeah.

53:18.202 --> 53:19.362
Uh-huh.

53:34.117 --> 53:37.712
- What an incredible night.
- Mm-hmm.

53:39.556 --> 53:41.285
Place sure hasn't
changed much, has it?

53:41.458 --> 53:42.823
No. Not at all.

53:43.860 --> 53:47.090
- Not that I came here much.
- No. Of course not.

53:47.263 --> 53:50.289
Bill was always in training.
He said it put him off his game.

53:50.433 --> 53:53.128
- Hmm. I see.
- Got riled up the night before.

53:53.268 --> 53:55.293
He didn't look so happy
on TV, either.

53:55.437 --> 54:00.875
Oh, God! Doesn't anybody watch
public television anymore?

54:01.009 --> 54:02.999
I couldn't keep my eyes
off of you.

54:05.012 --> 54:06.343
Which part captivated you more?

54:06.480 --> 54:08.880
Was it the part where...
let's see...

54:09.016 --> 54:12.315
where I appeared downtrodden
and pitiful,

54:12.486 --> 54:16.684
or was it the part where
I looked stricken and grotesque?

54:16.790 --> 54:21.158
I personally prefer the part
where I looked pathetic.

54:21.327 --> 54:22.555
I liked that one.

54:22.695 --> 54:25.323
I preferred the part
where you appeared available.

54:27.633 --> 54:29.999
- Grow up.
- Don't you feel young over here?

54:30.102 --> 54:31.967
Just sitting in this truck?

54:33.673 --> 54:35.731
At Old Man Linton's? God!

54:39.644 --> 54:41.441
I feel like I'm 16 again.

54:46.318 --> 54:48.115
Oh, get real, Justin.

55:18.181 --> 55:21.048
I never kissed a man
before Bill.

55:25.254 --> 55:26.687
Who said anything about kissin'?

55:28.656 --> 55:30.055
Did I say that?

55:53.914 --> 55:57.610
But I still love to dance

55:57.750 --> 56:03.518
You know we used to dance
the night away

56:05.891 --> 56:07.119
Birdee Calvert.

56:07.293 --> 56:11.491
Back when we were beautiful

56:17.902 --> 56:21.895
Please, Daddy, come
and get me before it's too late.

56:31.248 --> 56:35.685
- I don't feel so good, Grandma.
- Ohh...

56:37.688 --> 56:41.488
- You're going to school, Rocky.
- Man, it's not fair!

56:54.837 --> 56:56.065
Come on, Travis.

57:00.977 --> 57:04.604
# Paper wings

57:06.981 --> 57:10.849
# Autumn ending

57:14.488 --> 57:23.486
# You made me feel that thing
was heaven-sent

57:46.418 --> 57:47.544
Four-eyes.

57:48.987 --> 57:51.854
Bookworm. Popeye.

57:53.557 --> 57:58.153
# Angels will sing

58:19.182 --> 58:20.547
Fight! Fight! Fight!

58:36.265 --> 58:43.533
# But how could I expect to fly

58:43.637 --> 58:49.667
# With only paper wings?

58:49.843 --> 58:55.372
# I tried to fly, but fell

58:55.515 --> 59:03.046
# 'Cause I had only paper wings

59:09.962 --> 59:12.829
Hey. How was school?

59:14.533 --> 59:15.624
Huh?

59:17.235 --> 59:18.759
- Hey, weasel.
- Fine.

59:21.139 --> 59:22.766
- What happened?
- She lived.

59:46.797 --> 59:51.062
# I can turn the gray sky blue

59:51.234 --> 59:54.897
# I can make it rain
whenever I want it to

59:55.004 --> 59:59.839
# Oh, I can build a castle
from a single grain of sand

59:59.976 --> 01:00:04.276
# I can make a ship sail
on dry land

01:00:04.447 --> 01:00:08.439
# Ooh, but my life is incomplete,
and I'm so blue

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:11.108
# 'Cause I can't get next to you

01:00:11.286 --> 01:00:12.651
# Can't get next to you, babe

01:00:12.754 --> 01:00:13.982
# Next to you

01:00:14.122 --> 01:00:16.784
# I just can't get next to you

01:00:16.925 --> 01:00:19.358
# No matter what I do,
I can't get next to you

01:00:19.527 --> 01:00:20.653
# Ahh, yeah!

01:00:29.035 --> 01:00:31.401
# Whoo whoo whoo

01:00:33.573 --> 01:00:35.905
# Whoo whoo

01:00:37.943 --> 01:00:40.002
# Chick-a-boom, chick-a-boom,
check 'em out, look out

01:00:41.547 --> 01:00:44.345
#...what I need,
gotta get next to you

01:00:44.483 --> 01:00:48.852
# Can't you see this little fact?
Gotta get next to you

01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:52.249
# Take me back where I belong

01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:00.620
# Back to Travis County

01:01:03.835 --> 01:01:06.201
# I've been gone
for way too long

01:01:09.407 --> 01:01:12.500
Mr. And Mrs. Whitehead were
100 years old when I knew 'em.

01:01:22.986 --> 01:01:24.476
Uh... hi. Hi.

01:01:27.489 --> 01:01:28.786
Miss Ramona.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.959
- Did you want to dance with me?
- Oh, no.

01:01:35.064 --> 01:01:40.468
You go dance with someone
your own age. I never!

01:01:40.636 --> 01:01:43.661
- Sorry I bothered you.
- Well, all right, then.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:46.128
Excuse us, honey.

01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:51.705
Birdee? Birdee Pruitt?
It's me... Suzy.

01:01:51.846 --> 01:01:53.904
- Oh, my God! Hi!
- Hi!

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:56.777
- How are you?
- Well... ha ha!

01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:58.782
- Oh, my God!
- Baby's due in six weeks.

01:01:58.919 --> 01:02:03.378
I can see that. I thought
you'd moved to Houston.

01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:06.787
I'm just in for the weekend.
Your mama said you were in town.

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:09.862
- Yep, I'm here.
- You look wonderful.

01:02:09.996 --> 01:02:11.691
- Oh...
- Seriously.

01:02:11.864 --> 01:02:14.298
- Well, thank you.
- Aren't you clever?

01:02:14.433 --> 01:02:17.128
That's the way to get Bill
to come crawling back.

01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:19.430
Oh, I don't... that's...

01:02:20.572 --> 01:02:24.167
Would you look at Polka Dot?
The doughnut's best friend.

01:02:25.543 --> 01:02:28.307
Oh, look.
There's Justin Matisse.

01:02:29.047 --> 01:02:32.505
He lost that job in California.
Wouldn't work fast enough.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.917
Oops, he's headed this way.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.955
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:42.986
Honor me?

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.523
- What?
- I want to dance with you.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:51.962
- Justin, I can't.
- Excuse us.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:57.165
Justin, I can't dance anymore.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:01.437
Dancing's just a conversation
between two people. Talk to me.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.812
# Yeah, I started feelin' funny

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.749
# When you walked
through that door

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.414
# And it ain't happened yet

01:03:14.523 --> 01:03:18.084
# But I keep feelin'
that it'll happen

01:03:18.226 --> 01:03:21.684
# If I keep comin' back for more

01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:24.796
You can do it, now.

01:03:30.971 --> 01:03:31.960
Whoo!

01:03:32.872 --> 01:03:33.896
Wow.

01:03:40.913 --> 01:03:42.346
Oh, we got it now.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.586
Come on, now. Come on, Birdee.

01:04:04.268 --> 01:04:06.862
# Some kind of something happening

01:04:07.005 --> 01:04:09.235
# I'm not sure

01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:12.698
# But I know it ain't been
a year now

01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:14.037
# I'm feelin' it more

01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:15.371
Whoo-hoo!

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:21.346
# I started feelin' funny when
you walked through that door

01:04:21.518 --> 01:04:25.284
# Well, it ain't happened yet

01:04:25.422 --> 01:04:27.856
# But I'd be willin' to bet

01:04:27.958 --> 01:04:32.087
# If it happened once,
I'd keep comin' back for more

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.235
Thank you very much, folks.

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:46.568
We're gonna take
a short break now,

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:50.405
but we'll leave you with
some fine tunes on the jukebox.

01:04:50.578 --> 01:04:53.308
- Thanks for the dance.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:04:54.582 --> 01:04:55.446
What?

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:02.550
# And
the whole world is on your case

01:05:04.024 --> 01:05:08.687
# I would offer you a warm embrace

01:05:09.929 --> 01:05:13.160
# To make you feel my love

01:05:16.335 --> 01:05:20.930
# Evening shadows
and the stars appear

01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:29.003
# There's no one there
to dry your tears

01:05:29.147 --> 01:05:30.409
# Just breathe.

01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:33.313
#...for a million years

01:05:34.618 --> 01:05:37.849
# To make you feel my love

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:45.661
# I know you haven't
made your mind up yet

01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:50.394
# But I would never do you wrong

01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:57.836
# I've known it from the moment
that we met

01:05:59.442 --> 01:06:02.036
# No doubt in my mind
where you belong

01:06:08.183 --> 01:06:09.480
Hey, be kind.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.117
It's a work in progress.

01:06:18.293 --> 01:06:19.817
It's beautiful.

01:06:25.133 --> 01:06:26.293
It's a door.

01:06:29.137 --> 01:06:30.434
Come on in.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.073
This is it.

01:07:15.612 --> 01:07:17.477
Nineteenth-century Texas pine.

01:07:21.852 --> 01:07:23.080
Love that smell.

01:07:26.924 --> 01:07:27.982
Feel this.

01:07:32.995 --> 01:07:33.927
It's tongue and groove.

01:07:36.065 --> 01:07:37.293
Excuse me?

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:44.364
They're cut and matched perfect
to fit together.

01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:51.245
You, um... want to see the porch?

01:07:57.285 --> 01:07:58.445
It's this way.

01:08:03.324 --> 01:08:05.622
It'll have a great view
when the trailer's gone.

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:11.395
This will wrap
all around the house.

01:08:21.106 --> 01:08:23.666
This is nice.
They call that a swing.

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:25.174
Maybe you could hang it.

01:08:28.913 --> 01:08:33.475
Yeah, I could. This is from
Mom and Dad's old place.

01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:34.813
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:36.886 --> 01:08:38.479
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:08:41.692 --> 01:08:43.626
- It's comfy, huh?
- Yeah.

01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:48.960
This'll be a nice house, Justin.
Who was your architect?

01:08:49.133 --> 01:08:50.622
You kiddin', huh?

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:55.831
That's half the fun.

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:57.634
You go around Smithville
painting houses,

01:08:57.807 --> 01:08:59.069
and you can do this?

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.575
- Yep.
- You could do so much more.

01:09:05.282 --> 01:09:08.511
- I guess so, huh.
- You know what I meant.

01:09:08.651 --> 01:09:12.348
I know exactly what you meant.
The American Dream.

01:09:15.124 --> 01:09:18.685
You find something you love,
then you twist and torture it...

01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:23.026
Trying to find a way
to make money at it.

01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:24.529
Spend a lifetime doing that.

01:09:26.934 --> 01:09:30.165
At the end, there's not a trace
of what you started out lovin'.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.139
What did you start out lovin'?

01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:41.178
Don't remember.

01:09:41.314 --> 01:09:44.546
For me, it was doing
things right, that's all.

01:09:46.053 --> 01:09:49.580
That's why I came back, so
I could live the way I wanted.

01:09:49.723 --> 01:09:53.352
I figured out of everybody,
you'd understand that.

01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:04.060
I do.

01:10:05.537 --> 01:10:06.902
I envy you.

01:10:07.038 --> 01:10:10.633
Everything you love...
is right here.

01:10:15.646 --> 01:10:16.908
Not everything, Birdee.

01:10:21.352 --> 01:10:22.546
Hey, hey.

01:10:24.455 --> 01:10:26.218
- Justin, I can't...
- Shh.

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:47.065
You are so beautiful.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:11:02.486
# I'm not afraid of living alone

01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:07.491
# I was alone before he came

01:11:11.399 --> 01:11:17.497
# Don't have the strength
to fight anymore

01:11:17.638 --> 01:11:22.006
# This time's not the same

01:11:25.378 --> 01:11:30.077
# So tell me why I keep holding on

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:37.282
# To something I just cannot see

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.754
# What makes you stay

01:11:42.393 --> 01:11:45.260
# When your world falls apart?

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:52.961
# What makes you try one more time
when it's not in your heart?

01:11:53.103 --> 01:11:56.072
# At the end of your world

01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:59.902
# When you can't find any hope

01:12:01.511 --> 01:12:05.277
# You still look at him and say

01:12:07.451 --> 01:12:10.317
# I just can't walk away

01:12:13.055 --> 01:12:23.192
# Tell me, what makes you stay?

01:12:31.773 --> 01:12:33.741
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

01:12:47.087 --> 01:12:48.816
Mama?
Kitchen!

01:12:49.957 --> 01:12:52.653
- Where's Bernice?
- They ate hours ago.

01:12:52.793 --> 01:12:55.887
She had a face on her
like a bucket of worms.

01:12:56.029 --> 01:12:59.555
- I don't know what's going on.
- What's this?

01:12:59.732 --> 01:13:02.166
Nothing. I just invited Justin
over for dinner.

01:13:02.301 --> 01:13:04.292
He sounded like he needed
some cheering up.

01:13:04.437 --> 01:13:08.271
- I don't want to see Justin.
- Justin is my friend.

01:13:08.407 --> 01:13:12.206
If he's down in the dumps,
and I feel like cheering him up,

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:13.538
that's my business.

01:13:13.678 --> 01:13:16.475
This is not the time
for your matchmaking stunts.

01:13:16.614 --> 01:13:19.082
Matchmaking?
What an imagination.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:22.708
Oh, come on, Birdee.
Come on. Join us.

01:13:23.621 --> 01:13:26.647
You don't have to say anything.
You could just sit there.

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:30.248
Maybe you could quietly chew
or something.

01:13:32.295 --> 01:13:34.786
There's nothing you can do
about it, sweetie.

01:13:34.898 --> 01:13:37.264
I'm going upstairs to sleep.

01:13:39.035 --> 01:13:42.493
All right. Birdee, this has
never been a rude house.

01:13:42.672 --> 01:13:44.765
Strange, perhaps,
but never rude.

01:13:44.908 --> 01:13:47.342
I would like you
to welcome our guest.

01:13:49.244 --> 01:13:51.007
I'm still your mama. Move it!

01:13:57.386 --> 01:13:58.546
Hello, Bernice.

01:14:00.889 --> 01:14:03.289
- These are for you.
- Thanks, but I'm allergic.

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:06.483
- Hey, Miss Calvert.
- Hey, Justin, glad to see you.

01:14:06.627 --> 01:14:07.958
- How you doin'?
- Good.

01:14:08.095 --> 01:14:09.960
I don't want these.
Bernice.

01:14:10.097 --> 01:14:11.621
Thanks, anyway.

01:14:11.766 --> 01:14:13.233
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey, Justin.

01:14:13.968 --> 01:14:17.426
Oh, my goodness! You've
been cookin', Miss Calvert.

01:14:17.572 --> 01:14:20.564
I hope you enjoy it.
Yes, indeed.

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:24.234
Come on, let's all sit
down here now. That's fine.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:30.842
You're not joining us?

01:14:30.984 --> 01:14:34.442
I forgot I ate earlier
with the children.

01:14:34.621 --> 01:14:37.487
This memory's really goin'.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.195
Oh...

01:14:47.765 --> 01:14:48.959
Hmm...

01:14:51.736 --> 01:14:55.501
- Sorry about last night.
- I'm sorry about this morning.

01:14:59.943 --> 01:15:02.343
- I know you have a crush on me.
- A crush?

01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:08.478
- Birdee, this ain't high school.
- You know what I mean, Bill.

01:15:11.454 --> 01:15:12.580
Justin.

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:17.452
- What?
- My name is Justin.

01:15:18.928 --> 01:15:20.088
It ain't Bill.

01:15:25.434 --> 01:15:28.368
- I'm sorry.
- You know, Birdee...

01:15:28.503 --> 01:15:30.494
You used to be so...

01:15:32.674 --> 01:15:33.834
I don't know...

01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:37.910
Audacious. Bold.

01:15:38.046 --> 01:15:40.412
People would stop to watch you
come down the street.

01:15:40.582 --> 01:15:42.516
"Here comes
that Birdee Calvert."

01:15:42.651 --> 01:15:45.141
Their eyes would light up.
You could see it on their faces.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.314
Look at me.

01:15:48.489 --> 01:15:51.720
You think you've lost that.
I can still see it.

01:15:53.661 --> 01:15:57.961
- Bill can't see that.
- You know nothing about Bill.

01:15:58.065 --> 01:16:01.397
I know that Bill could
let you go. Damn, Birdee!

01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:04.868
When are you gonna face the fact
that he ain't comin' back?

01:16:05.004 --> 01:16:07.370
Get out of here!
My daddy is coming back!

01:16:07.507 --> 01:16:09.372
He loves me,
and he wants my mother.

01:16:09.509 --> 01:16:11.477
He'll kill you
if you come around here.

01:16:11.611 --> 01:16:13.135
- Tell him!
- Be quiet.

01:16:17.249 --> 01:16:19.308
- You better go.
- Yep.

01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:24.285
Why don't both of you go out?
Bernice and I will stay here.

01:16:24.422 --> 01:16:27.823
That's all right. When you're
tired of waiting, call me.

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:30.290
I hope I'm still around.
Thanks, Miss Calvert.

01:16:34.998 --> 01:16:37.933
You just amaze me,
Birdee.

01:16:38.101 --> 01:16:41.161
Your love life has always been
a disaster area.

01:16:41.304 --> 01:16:44.137
They ought to have
big orange cones all around you.

01:16:45.608 --> 01:16:49.304
What can I say?
I'm my own crown of thorns.

01:16:49.445 --> 01:16:52.312
Hey, you think
life goes on forever?

01:16:53.549 --> 01:16:57.315
You think behind every chance
there's another one?

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.351
It's the worst kind of
extravagance, spending chances.

01:17:02.858 --> 01:17:04.723
Get out of here,
Don't come back!

01:17:04.893 --> 01:17:06.018
Bernice!

01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:14.801
Bernice, stop it!
What's the matter with you?

01:17:14.936 --> 01:17:17.404
Why didn't you tell him
he loves us?

01:17:17.538 --> 01:17:19.506
Oh, God, Bernice,
because I don't know.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.574
I don't know if Daddy loves us
or if he's coming back.

01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:25.701
He loves me,
even if he doesn't love you!

01:17:25.846 --> 01:17:28.576
Oh, I just sent him away.
What more do you want?

01:17:28.749 --> 01:17:32.583
I want my Daddy. He left because
you didn't love him enough.

01:17:32.719 --> 01:17:34.584
No, Bernice, your daddy
didn't love me enough.

01:17:34.755 --> 01:17:36.450
You know this is all your fault.

01:17:44.163 --> 01:17:46.290
Whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.731
Aunt Birdee, help! Please?

01:17:51.237 --> 01:17:54.104
Somebody? I've fallen over,
and I can't get up! Help!

01:17:54.507 --> 01:17:56.770
You know,
that is the prettiest one.

01:18:01.378 --> 01:18:03.175
Birdee Calvert.

01:18:03.881 --> 01:18:06.042
She looks like
she belongs in a bar.

01:18:06.216 --> 01:18:09.310
Hello, Birdee.
It's about time you said hi.

01:18:09.453 --> 01:18:11.545
- Hey, Mike.
- You being good?

01:18:12.555 --> 01:18:15.956
I'm trying to be, but it doesn't
seem to be working out that way.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:20.652
Uh, can I get a vodka tonic,
extra lime, please?

01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:22.128
- Sure, you may.
- Thanks.

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:25.233
Senior citizens
in a convalescent home.

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.859
Raquel, what do you want
to say to Damius?

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:30.597
You know how
I get calls really late?

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:35.242
Just say it. What?
When they call me...

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:37.878
It's on me.
They call me to dance.

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:43.181
I'm really an exotic dancer.

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:48.048
Raquel... you shouldn't
have done this on TV.

01:18:56.931 --> 01:19:00.560
I mean, "Birdee."
What kind of name is... what...

01:19:00.701 --> 01:19:02.190
You know what happens
to birdies?

01:19:02.368 --> 01:19:05.360
They're cat food
or target practice.

01:19:05.505 --> 01:19:07.496
Birdee. Birdee. Birdee!

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:13.476
It's a good name.
Have some coffee. Pace yourself.

01:19:13.613 --> 01:19:15.843
- I'm fine. I'm gonna go home.
- You sure?

01:19:15.982 --> 01:19:17.710
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:21.877
Don't let me
get like that, for God's sakes!

01:19:24.923 --> 01:19:28.017
Pretty pathetic, huh?
Uh-huh!

01:19:28.193 --> 01:19:31.720
Poor woman. Husband leaves her
on national television.

01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:33.229
I know. We cried.

01:19:34.732 --> 01:19:37.359
Do not believe
everything you see, all right?

01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:41.862
If I believed everything
I saw down at the photo shop...

01:19:43.273 --> 01:19:47.266
I'd believe Miss Bobbi-Claire
got herself some new titties.

01:19:51.547 --> 01:19:55.074
I got one word for y'all:
Polaroids.

01:19:55.251 --> 01:20:00.917
Polaroid... oh, come on!
Bobbi-Claire, don't leave.

01:20:01.023 --> 01:20:04.652
- Come on! You won!
- Take it easy, Birdee.

01:20:04.793 --> 01:20:07.090
Que sera, sera, people.

01:20:14.636 --> 01:20:17.070
Birdee, are you OK?

01:20:19.274 --> 01:20:22.539
Whatever you do,
please don't say anything.

01:20:22.677 --> 01:20:27.204
Don't be clever, don't be smart,
'cause I can't take it tonight.

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:29.510
Sit on that.

01:20:32.052 --> 01:20:34.452
The tiles are always
so cold in this bathroom.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.919
Everything's so wrong
without Bill.

01:20:42.628 --> 01:20:46.291
I know.
I miss him so much.

01:20:46.432 --> 01:20:48.593
He used to call me "baby."

01:20:48.734 --> 01:20:54.832
I never thought I'd like that,
but I did... with him.

01:20:54.974 --> 01:20:56.235
Sure, you do.

01:20:58.076 --> 01:20:59.441
I miss his hands.

01:21:01.279 --> 01:21:06.717
I miss the way he would put them
on the small of my back...

01:21:06.818 --> 01:21:08.911
and lead me into a room.

01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:11.946
It made me feel so safe.

01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:16.558
I miss all that.

01:21:16.693 --> 01:21:18.786
- Of course you do.
- Uh-huh.

01:21:19.929 --> 01:21:25.367
You know, it's so easy to
believe him, but you know what?

01:21:25.535 --> 01:21:29.026
I think it's me.
I do, because...

01:21:30.572 --> 01:21:35.271
He used to look at me,
and I'd see myself in his eyes,

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:37.275
and it was like he saw me.

01:21:38.413 --> 01:21:43.817
And I was audacious, Mama.
I was. And then...

01:21:45.253 --> 01:21:47.812
Things started to change.

01:21:47.922 --> 01:21:51.221
The harder I'd try to be
what he wanted me to be,

01:21:51.392 --> 01:21:53.553
the less I saw myself
in his eyes.

01:21:55.296 --> 01:21:58.993
One day I looked,
and I was gone.

01:22:01.968 --> 01:22:05.165
- I still see her.
- No, Mama, no.

01:22:05.305 --> 01:22:07.830
No, it's happening
with Bernice, too.

01:22:07.974 --> 01:22:09.942
It's happening with Bernice.

01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:12.442
She doesn't look at me
the same way.

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:17.074
It's like there's
a wall between us.

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:19.513
There's a wall,
and it's killing me,

01:22:19.618 --> 01:22:23.179
'cause the one thing I said
when I grow up,

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.585
if I ever had
a daughter of my own,

01:22:25.724 --> 01:22:29.285
she would know her mother
loved her, and I would hug her,

01:22:29.428 --> 01:22:31.828
and I would tell her
nice things,

01:22:31.964 --> 01:22:35.330
and I wouldn't just let
the daddy do all the hugging.

01:22:46.911 --> 01:22:51.142
And I know. I realize
that it doesn't matter...

01:22:52.715 --> 01:22:58.210
...who or what or when
or where the hugging happens.

01:22:59.455 --> 01:23:01.047
Sometimes you just need a hug.

01:23:02.658 --> 01:23:05.252
And it just hasn't
worked out that way.

01:23:05.394 --> 01:23:06.827
You know, I...

01:23:10.265 --> 01:23:11.823
I've seen you hug
your daughter.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:19.939
She knows you love her.

01:23:23.211 --> 01:23:25.974
Yeah, mothers love
their daughters.

01:23:28.282 --> 01:23:30.250
Even if they show it poorly.

01:24:07.652 --> 01:24:10.143
Hi, Julia.
Here's the talent show list.

01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:14.083
It's up!
The audition list is up!

01:24:14.225 --> 01:24:17.353
I hope I'm near the beginning.
I'm so nervous.

01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:19.487
Bernice!

01:24:27.871 --> 01:24:29.498
Ber... Bernice!

01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:34.637
I was gonna do a poem.
They don't like too many poems.

01:24:34.743 --> 01:24:36.108
Hey...
Hey, Birdee.

01:24:36.278 --> 01:24:39.338
- Hey, Chris. How are you?
- Fine. What's up?

01:24:39.481 --> 01:24:42.473
I was wondering if you could...
Bernice!

01:24:43.552 --> 01:24:46.487
- Bernice, honey!
- Isn't that your mom?

01:24:51.692 --> 01:24:53.125
Sweetheart!

01:24:57.398 --> 01:24:58.194
Let's go.

01:25:06.606 --> 01:25:08.733
Could you give this to her?
She forgot it.

01:25:08.875 --> 01:25:12.311
- I'll make sure she gets it.
- Thanks. Good to see you again.

01:25:29.628 --> 01:25:34.031
# When
the rain is blowin' in your face

01:25:35.734 --> 01:25:39.794
# And the whole world
is on your case

01:25:41.539 --> 01:25:45.771
# I could offer you a warm embrace

01:25:47.178 --> 01:25:51.205
# To make you feel my love

01:25:53.116 --> 01:25:58.110
# When evening shadows
and the stars appear

01:26:04.126 --> 01:26:05.286
# And there is no one
to dry your tears

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:10.195
# I could hold you
for a million years

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:16.163
# To make you feel my love

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:26.907
Hey, Daddy.

01:26:34.288 --> 01:26:37.018
- Do you remember who I am?
- Hello.

01:26:38.759 --> 01:26:39.885
Hi.

01:26:42.362 --> 01:26:43.659
Isn't she beautiful?

01:26:47.567 --> 01:26:52.004
- Yes, sir, she sure is.
- That's my daughter... Birdee.

01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:57.541
- She's marked for happiness.
- How do you know that?

01:26:57.644 --> 01:27:00.635
If you'll look at her, child,
you'll see it.

01:27:05.384 --> 01:27:06.715
By God, you're right.

01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:10.181
I see it.

01:27:23.768 --> 01:27:26.566
Hey, honey,
your mom called a while ago.

01:27:26.704 --> 01:27:30.231
She said she'd be home soon.
You want me to tuck you in?

01:27:31.341 --> 01:27:35.072
- Yep? How tight?
- Tight.

01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:40.204
OK. Snug as a bug in a rug.

01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:42.810
You're just like your mama.

01:27:42.918 --> 01:27:46.081
She used to love me
to tuck her in real tight.

01:27:47.989 --> 01:27:51.618
I'm not like her.
We're different.

01:27:51.793 --> 01:27:53.658
It's like we're
not even relatives.

01:27:53.795 --> 01:27:58.562
Ah, well... yeah. Yeah.
I know what you mean.

01:28:00.201 --> 01:28:02.999
Relatives are trouble.
I couldn't agree more.

01:28:04.138 --> 01:28:08.301
I ever tell you about Walter,
my brother? No? Well...

01:28:09.476 --> 01:28:12.639
What you have to go through
with your mama, the suffering,

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:14.839
that's what I had to suffer
with Walter.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.616
One day, we were playing
down by the river,

01:28:18.785 --> 01:28:23.619
and we came across the most
beautiful anthill you ever saw.

01:28:24.757 --> 01:28:27.988
And bein' Walter,
he immediately kicked it...

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.994
and stomped on it, just
scattering it to the four winds.

01:28:32.164 --> 01:28:33.631
I just started howling.

01:28:33.733 --> 01:28:36.224
I was just...
I yelled for my mama.

01:28:36.402 --> 01:28:38.562
I grabbed her
and dragged her down there,

01:28:38.670 --> 01:28:40.069
just crying and carrying on.

01:28:41.272 --> 01:28:45.231
Anyway, my mama was trying
to calm me down, so she said,

01:28:45.377 --> 01:28:49.643
"Wait, wait. They're not
finished, not by a long shot."

01:28:49.781 --> 01:28:53.182
And we waited and waited,
and sure enough,

01:28:53.318 --> 01:28:58.880
those little black specks
started scurrying everywhere,

01:28:59.056 --> 01:29:02.150
just working hard
to build their home back.

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.893
And I said, "Why did they do it?
I'd just give up.

01:29:06.029 --> 01:29:07.724
I mean, it's hopeless."

01:29:08.766 --> 01:29:13.225
And my mama said, "Yeah,
if there was just one ant.

01:29:13.403 --> 01:29:15.063
"But there's lots of ants
down there.

01:29:15.203 --> 01:29:17.603
"They're all relatives.

01:29:17.706 --> 01:29:20.300
They're family,
just like we are."

01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:24.277
Well, that's
what families are for.

01:29:24.446 --> 01:29:26.709
That's why
they invented families...

01:29:26.847 --> 01:29:29.111
so "hopeless"
didn't get the last word.

01:29:30.251 --> 01:29:33.948
So if ants can do it,
I figure we can do it.

01:29:38.259 --> 01:29:42.889
You know, my Birdee has a lot
more strength than she knows.

01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:47.688
And... one of these days,
she's going to realize that.

01:29:53.273 --> 01:29:57.733
- I love you, Grandma.
- Oh... oh, honey. Honey.

01:30:00.679 --> 01:30:02.010
My cup runneth over.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:14.447
Say, haven't you got a birthday
comin' up pretty soon?

01:30:15.461 --> 01:30:17.325
Want to tell Grandma
what you wish for?

01:30:18.362 --> 01:30:19.852
- No?
- No.

01:30:19.964 --> 01:30:20.988
No?

01:30:21.165 --> 01:30:24.692
Well, never mind.
I'll figure that out.

01:30:24.802 --> 01:30:27.828
I have my magic ways.

01:30:29.974 --> 01:30:31.805
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

01:30:43.286 --> 01:30:47.222
Oh, Birdee!
When did you get home?

01:30:47.357 --> 01:30:52.315
Oh, a while ago.
I went to go see Daddy.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.291
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

01:30:55.163 --> 01:30:56.596
You were always Daddy's girl.

01:30:59.667 --> 01:31:01.134
Not just his, Mama.

01:31:03.938 --> 01:31:05.030
Thank you.

01:31:09.076 --> 01:31:12.204
Well... you're most welcome.

01:31:17.451 --> 01:31:19.749
I'm gonna get some tea.
You want some?

01:31:19.887 --> 01:31:21.354
No, I'm OK. Thanks.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.922
- Grandma? Grandma?
- Mama?

01:32:07.965 --> 01:32:09.762
- Grandma!
- Mama.

01:32:10.668 --> 01:32:13.534
Mama? Mama, what's up?
What's wrong, Mama?

01:32:14.504 --> 01:32:18.770
Oh, God, Mama.
Bernice, go dial 911.

01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:20.569
Mama... this isn't
happening to me.

01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:23.804
Come on. Not now, Mama.
Don't do this to me now.

01:32:23.947 --> 01:32:28.143
Don't do this to me now.
Wake up, Mama. Mama, wake up!

01:32:28.316 --> 01:32:31.114
Wake up! Mama. Mama, please!

01:32:31.252 --> 01:32:38.090
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. No, no, no, no...

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:14.270
Privileged to have known
Ramona Calvert all my life.

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:18.476
She doesn't need to be
idealized in death...

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:20.314
beyond what she was in life.

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:26.351
A complicated woman
and a generous one, proud,

01:34:26.492 --> 01:34:31.191
and yet humble enough to help
many of her neighbors quietly.

01:34:32.498 --> 01:34:34.966
The mother
of two fine daughters,

01:34:35.134 --> 01:34:37.329
and the wife of one good man.

01:34:37.437 --> 01:34:42.066
She doesn't require any fancy
words from the likes of me.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:46.336
All I need to say is,
we'll all miss her.

01:34:47.379 --> 01:34:50.837
And I know, even seated
next to our father...

01:34:50.949 --> 01:34:54.441
Daddy came back for us!
He came back.

01:34:54.619 --> 01:34:57.587
Thank you, Grandma.
May she rest in peace.

01:34:58.789 --> 01:35:02.225
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit...

01:35:02.393 --> 01:35:04.258
Amen.
May God be with you.

01:35:04.395 --> 01:35:06.590
And also with you.

01:35:14.237 --> 01:35:16.398
Daddy, I knew you'd come back!
I knew it!

01:35:17.273 --> 01:35:19.707
Take it easy.
You're chokin' me.

01:35:19.809 --> 01:35:21.333
Let's get a look at you.

01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:29.149
- What are you doing?
- Taking it home.

01:35:29.318 --> 01:35:33.152
- OK. Hey.
- You doin' all right?

01:35:33.288 --> 01:35:34.414
Yeah.

01:35:35.457 --> 01:35:36.515
Thanks.

01:35:39.027 --> 01:35:40.357
Want to see Mama?

01:36:04.784 --> 01:36:05.751
Hey, Travis.

01:36:09.688 --> 01:36:11.212
Mind if I sit down?

01:36:25.837 --> 01:36:28.704
Birdee, why don't you sit down?
That can wait.

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.000
OK.

01:36:32.443 --> 01:36:35.002
Would you like any sugar
or cream with that?

01:36:35.145 --> 01:36:36.339
I'm fine.

01:36:38.549 --> 01:36:40.107
Want anything, sweetheart?

01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:41.842
- I'm good.
- Yeah? OK.

01:36:47.257 --> 01:36:48.554
You got a telegram.

01:36:52.662 --> 01:36:54.391
I waited my whole life
to get one.

01:36:56.065 --> 01:36:57.327
Still ain't had one.

01:37:02.038 --> 01:37:03.300
It's from your mom.

01:37:07.176 --> 01:37:10.508
She must care about you a lot
to send you a telegram.

01:37:12.814 --> 01:37:14.076
It's for Aunt Birdee.

01:37:17.852 --> 01:37:18.978
Even so.

01:37:22.690 --> 01:37:23.952
What you thinkin' about?

01:37:26.259 --> 01:37:27.624
Whether Aunt Birdee wants me.

01:37:31.731 --> 01:37:32.891
Yeah, she does.

01:37:37.804 --> 01:37:38.998
My grandma's dead.

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:47.904
I know.

01:37:50.749 --> 01:37:52.717
Birdee, don't make me
feel bad about this.

01:37:54.286 --> 01:37:56.049
Only thing I'm guilty of
is falling in love.

01:37:56.889 --> 01:37:59.789
I didn't want it to happen.
I didn't seek it out, Birdee.

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:01.822
- It just happened.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:38:01.993 --> 01:38:03.620
Are you talking about me
or Connie?

01:38:03.728 --> 01:38:07.755
You seem to fall in love easily,
so it's natural to be confused.

01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:12.734
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I told you to play outside.

01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:16.762
- I will when you stop fighting.
- We're not fightin'.

01:38:16.907 --> 01:38:20.866
- Nobody's fightin' here.
- Nope. Never did, did you?

01:38:21.044 --> 01:38:24.013
Lies always came really easy
to you, didn't they. Real easy.

01:38:25.015 --> 01:38:29.042
Almost as easy as discarding
your wife and child.

01:38:29.152 --> 01:38:31.517
Kind of like a to-do list.

01:38:31.654 --> 01:38:35.385
Wife's gone... check.
Daughter's gone... check, check.

01:38:35.524 --> 01:38:38.049
- Birdee, you left. Remember?
- No.

01:38:39.328 --> 01:38:41.660
You left long before I left you.

01:38:41.764 --> 01:38:43.789
This isn't about
who left first, Birdee.

01:38:45.034 --> 01:38:46.557
We're not in love anymore.

01:38:47.635 --> 01:38:49.068
You said
you weren't gonna fight.

01:38:50.038 --> 01:38:53.200
Bernice, if you don't get out of
this house, you'll wish you had.

01:38:54.308 --> 01:38:55.707
Don't you ruin anything!

01:38:57.878 --> 01:39:00.369
Look, if you fell
out of love with me,

01:39:00.514 --> 01:39:01.879
you should've left long ago...

01:39:02.049 --> 01:39:03.777
instead of skirtin' around
behind my back.

01:39:06.218 --> 01:39:07.617
Maybe I'll go there one day.

01:39:10.589 --> 01:39:13.422
- Where's that?
- California.

01:39:15.027 --> 01:39:16.289
To see my mom.

01:39:19.365 --> 01:39:20.797
I'm sure she'd like that.

01:39:22.901 --> 01:39:23.959
Yeah.

01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.365
How come you're out here
all by yourself?

01:39:32.744 --> 01:39:36.577
- Where's that crazy Bernice?
- She's inside with her father.

01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:43.242
- Everything's OK, right?
- Yeah.

01:39:44.755 --> 01:39:46.120
What you feel like doin'?

01:39:47.691 --> 01:39:51.149
- Want to go for a walk?
- Aren't you going to say hi?

01:39:54.097 --> 01:39:55.291
Don't you know?

01:39:57.066 --> 01:40:00.160
- I came over to say hi to you.
- Hi.

01:40:00.903 --> 01:40:03.997
God, I would've stayed
with you forever.

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:09.708
I would've turned myself
inside out for you.

01:40:09.845 --> 01:40:11.506
Birdee,
I wouldn't have let you.

01:40:13.682 --> 01:40:16.674
People grow. They change.
They have to.

01:40:16.818 --> 01:40:18.217
You don't think I know that?

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:24.518
I know that I'm not
what I once was.

01:40:25.659 --> 01:40:26.819
I know that.

01:40:28.362 --> 01:40:29.885
But neither are you.

01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:32.457
You're sad, you're weak,
and you're... you're shorter,

01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:38.203
if you want to know the truth.

01:40:38.605 --> 01:40:43.769
But I haven't changed so much
that I'd lie to someone I loved.

01:40:43.909 --> 01:40:49.074
I'd walk through fire before I'd
let them feel they were nothin'.

01:40:51.216 --> 01:40:54.344
And I would never break up
anybody's home.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:59.221
Because I am not a quitter.
I care about my family.

01:41:00.124 --> 01:41:01.489
I'm in love with Connie.

01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:07.629
This is my chance for a fresh
start, and I'm takin' it.

01:41:07.799 --> 01:41:09.198
Then you should take it.

01:41:11.469 --> 01:41:13.130
If that's your chance,
then you should take it.

01:41:14.539 --> 01:41:16.870
You're right. You and Connie
deserve each other.

01:41:18.008 --> 01:41:22.240
You were lucky to have me.
But you know what?

01:41:22.345 --> 01:41:25.576
I think I already got
the best part of you.

01:41:29.186 --> 01:41:32.848
She's standing right out there,
and she's waitin' for me.

01:41:34.023 --> 01:41:38.483
What's left over
doesn't look so good anymore.

01:41:40.362 --> 01:41:44.924
So why'd you come back?
You want my permission?

01:41:47.203 --> 01:41:51.468
You want my condolences?
Why'd you come back?

01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:57.576
I didn't want to do this today,
but I want a divorce, Birdee.

01:42:00.915 --> 01:42:02.280
I'm coming with you, Daddy!

01:42:30.408 --> 01:42:32.535
Bernice?
I'm going with Daddy.

01:42:38.482 --> 01:42:41.007
Bernice, what do you think
you're doin'?

01:42:41.185 --> 01:42:44.382
- I'm going with you.
- Honey, that's impossible.

01:42:45.456 --> 01:42:48.516
- But I'm going with you.
- You gotta stay with your mama.

01:42:49.593 --> 01:42:51.083
Birdee, you gonna help me out?

01:42:52.463 --> 01:42:55.192
You told me you wanted me
with you, remember?

01:42:55.331 --> 01:42:57.390
Listen, honey, I've got to go.

01:42:58.902 --> 01:43:02.929
Don't do this to yourself, OK?
Don't make a scene.

01:43:03.106 --> 01:43:04.664
Go on back inside. Go ahead.

01:43:17.886 --> 01:43:19.183
Stop it, Daddy!

01:43:20.222 --> 01:43:23.953
Bernice, you know I'd take you
with me if I could.

01:43:24.092 --> 01:43:26.253
- You can!
- Try to understand, baby.

01:43:27.328 --> 01:43:31.025
Connie and I need this time to
ourselves, to make a go of it.

01:43:31.165 --> 01:43:34.623
Then I'll come back for you.
I promise, I promise!

01:43:34.769 --> 01:43:36.396
Now, go on inside, please!

01:43:40.007 --> 01:43:42.441
You want me!
You wrote it in a letter!

01:43:42.542 --> 01:43:46.102
Please... let me in!
You want me!

01:43:46.278 --> 01:43:49.805
I'll always want you, Bernice.
You're my little princess.

01:43:49.915 --> 01:43:52.406
- No.
- But your mama needs you.

01:43:52.551 --> 01:43:54.178
- No!
- And you need her.

01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:57.550
No, I don't! I need you!

01:43:57.656 --> 01:43:59.180
- I love you, princess.
- Please!

01:43:59.358 --> 01:44:01.825
- I gotta go.
- No! No!

01:44:03.461 --> 01:44:08.057
Daddy! Daddy! Please! Daddy!

01:44:08.199 --> 01:44:13.660
Daddy! Daddy!

01:44:27.351 --> 01:44:29.319
I want my daddy!

01:44:42.798 --> 01:44:45.130
Why did you pretend
that letter was from Daddy?

01:44:47.236 --> 01:44:48.669
What an imagination you have.

01:44:52.507 --> 01:44:59.538
You know, I always thought that
I was going to be... special.

01:45:00.749 --> 01:45:06.778
But I'm not. I'm just...
just an ordinary person.

01:45:09.056 --> 01:45:10.318
And that's OK.

01:45:12.726 --> 01:45:15.889
Because you make me special.

01:45:19.265 --> 01:45:20.527
Don't you know that?

01:45:22.701 --> 01:45:25.898
Don't you know you are
everything in this world to me?

01:45:29.608 --> 01:45:34.773
And we'll make it through this
because... we are a team.

01:45:37.549 --> 01:45:41.609
Birdee and Bernice, the coolest
chicks in Smithville.

01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:48.549
Don't ever think about
leaving me again.

01:45:52.163 --> 01:45:53.460
Because I need you.

01:45:58.168 --> 01:45:59.226
I love you.

01:46:01.538 --> 01:46:03.836
- Me, too.
- Good.

01:46:23.492 --> 01:46:23.514
Bad dog!
Very bad dog!

01:46:38.506 --> 01:46:41.339
Anything interesting come in
while I was at lunch?

01:46:41.509 --> 01:46:42.669
No, sir.

01:46:45.712 --> 01:46:48.909
Oh! Oh, no! Look at these.

01:46:49.082 --> 01:46:51.016
- Birdee?
- No!

01:46:51.151 --> 01:46:55.644
What's wrong with this stupid
machine? God, I tell you, I'd...

01:47:13.138 --> 01:47:15.698
# When you love someone

01:47:17.508 --> 01:47:19.999
# You'll do anything

01:47:20.144 --> 01:47:22.112
OK, Mama, stop pushin'.

01:47:22.246 --> 01:47:25.374
# You'll do all the crazy things

01:47:26.784 --> 01:47:28.843
# That you can't explain

01:47:31.355 --> 01:47:33.220
# You'll shoot the moon

01:47:35.625 --> 01:47:37.559
# Put out the sun

01:47:39.595 --> 01:47:41.529
# When you love someone

01:47:48.404 --> 01:47:50.564
# You'll deny the truth

01:47:53.041 --> 01:47:54.838
# Believe a lie

01:47:56.478 --> 01:48:00.039
# There'll be times
that you believe

01:48:01.016 --> 01:48:03.348
# That you can really fly

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.714
# That your lonely nights

01:48:10.257 --> 01:48:12.521
# Have just begun

01:48:14.061 --> 01:48:15.858
# When you love someone

01:48:22.570 --> 01:48:24.059
# And when you love someone

01:48:27.073 --> 01:48:29.507
# You feel it deep inside

01:48:29.642 --> 01:48:30.666
Y'all ready?

01:48:30.777 --> 01:48:33.870
Go ahead. I want to talk
to Bernice for a second.

01:48:34.046 --> 01:48:36.981
Aah!
Vroom!

01:48:37.115 --> 01:48:39.049
You're stuck with us now, buddy.

01:48:41.486 --> 01:48:42.748
What are you lookin' at?

01:48:46.249 --> 01:48:48.749
My cup runneth over.

01:48:55.150 --> 01:48:56.749
- Mom?
- What?

01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:58.550
Are you gonna marry Justin Matisse?

01:48:59.151 --> 01:49:02.051
Oh honey, I don't think I'm gonna get
married for quite some time.

01:49:02.952 --> 01:49:03.952
Why? You don't like Justin?

01:49:04.453 --> 01:49:08.753
It's not that.
It's just...

01:49:09.154 --> 01:49:10.154
What is it?

01:49:12.654 --> 01:49:13.754
You can be honest with me.
Tell me.

01:49:14.655 --> 01:49:17.655
I just don't want to be known
as Bernise Mathisse.

01:49:19.656 --> 01:49:24.456
Oh God Bernise.
You are a fun girl, you know that?

01:49:25.057 --> 01:49:26.657
I never said any different.

01:49:29.957 --> 01:49:33.857
My dad says that childhood is
the happiest time of my life.

01:49:34.458 --> 01:49:37.958
But I think he is wrong.
I think my mom's right.

01:49:37.959 --> 01:49:43.359
She says that: 'Childhood is what you spend
the rest of your life trying to overcome'.

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:46.859
That's what momma used to say.

01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:52.860
She said: 'Beginnings are scary, endings are
usually sad, but it's the middle that counts the most'.

01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:56.161
You need to remember that
when you find yourself at the beginning.

01:49:57.062 --> 01:49:58.562
Just give hope as chance to float up.

01:49:59.663 --> 01:50:00.763
And it will too.

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:16.400
# When you love someone.
