<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

00:18.855 --> 00:19.921
Hi, Maddie.

00:22.092 --> 00:23.925
Some things still come for you.

00:26.059 --> 00:27.259
_

00:28.164 --> 00:30.765
Julia Langmore? Jesus Christ.

00:30.767 --> 00:32.165
You a big famous artist, yet?

00:32.168 --> 00:34.002
You should be ashamed of who you are!

00:34.004 --> 00:36.311
What you did in the
grand scheme is nothing.

00:36.346 --> 00:39.674
Besides, no one will ever find out,
because it's fixed.

00:39.676 --> 00:41.876
That's what power and influence does.

00:41.878 --> 00:43.544
It fixes things.

00:43.546 --> 00:45.113
This is the actual Alice.

00:45.115 --> 00:46.681
Maddie was with you
before she was with me.

00:46.683 --> 00:48.349
<i>She was, like, doing a version of her.</i>

00:48.351 --> 00:50.918
Okay, Sophia gets here
in an hour and a half.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.387
Okay, guys, we gotta go.

00:52.389 --> 00:55.556
We gotta go now. Come on!

00:55.558 --> 00:57.392
Come on.

00:59.829 --> 01:03.731
- What do you think about Lazlo?
- He is your husband.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.433
Don't know if that's true anymore.

01:05.435 --> 01:07.368
Your beloved Cy Roberts
dropped the ball again.

01:07.370 --> 01:08.636
You know,
we all have an expiration date,

01:08.638 --> 01:10.371
even Cy Roberts.

01:10.373 --> 01:11.973
First, I have to rescue
my family from Max.

01:11.975 --> 01:13.708
We meet up someplace discreet.

01:13.710 --> 01:15.476
Hey, what's going on
at the cabin these days?

01:15.478 --> 01:16.944
Nothing.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.579
Why don't you guys use it as a hideout?

01:18.581 --> 01:20.815
It's way upstate New York,
like, in the woods woods.

01:20.817 --> 01:21.816
<i>Then we have a plan.</i>

01:21.818 --> 01:23.317
What's up, Doc?

01:23.319 --> 01:25.953
<i>You need to find those three imposters.</i>

01:25.955 --> 01:28.089
It means I'm sitting
next to Arthur Bloom.

01:33.129 --> 01:34.729
Look, we had a problem here.

01:34.731 --> 01:35.997
Wasn't supposed to go down this way.

01:35.999 --> 01:37.432
What did you do to him?

01:43.473 --> 01:47.408
This traces our family all the way back
to Charles Langmore I.

01:47.410 --> 01:50.511
He was named Baron of Essex in 1780.

01:50.513 --> 01:53.481
And that is my great-grandfather,

01:53.483 --> 01:55.917
Governor Charles Langmore VI,

01:55.919 --> 02:00.488
famous conservationist and a patron
of the Yale School of Forestry.

02:00.490 --> 02:05.293
Forests are important.

02:05.295 --> 02:07.462
Yes, they are.

02:07.464 --> 02:09.130
Do you know what else the
two of you have in common?

02:09.132 --> 02:10.198
Huh?

02:10.199 --> 02:12.033
A concern

02:12.035 --> 02:15.203
for the welfare of your state.

02:15.205 --> 02:18.272
- Say that again.
- What?

02:18.274 --> 02:20.708
That last bit. A concern for...

02:20.710 --> 02:23.111
The welfare of your state?

02:23.113 --> 02:26.481
And what do you suggest
I do to improve it?

02:26.483 --> 02:29.117
Well, you're going to need someone with

02:29.119 --> 02:33.688
a lot of experience to
fund your super PAC.

02:33.690 --> 02:36.390
Mm-hmm. What else?

02:36.392 --> 02:40.161
Gather supporters,
people who will endorse you.

02:40.163 --> 02:42.196
Do you have someone specific in mind?

02:42.198 --> 02:46.901
Well, any candidate I endorse
is sure to rise.

03:09.559 --> 03:11.959
- Ezra?
<i>- Jules, hey.</i>

03:11.961 --> 03:13.427
Why haven't you answered our texts?

03:13.429 --> 03:15.029
It's been, like, two days.

03:15.031 --> 03:17.698
<i>Yeah, sorry.</i>

03:17.700 --> 03:19.667
<i>Something terrible happened.</i>

03:19.669 --> 03:22.203
What happened?

03:22.205 --> 03:26.107
<i>My dad died.</i>

03:26.109 --> 03:28.209
<i>And they're off.</i>

03:28.211 --> 03:31.078
<i>Foley's Folly breaks smartly
from the inside gate.</i>

03:32.615 --> 03:34.916
<i>Dazzie moves quickly up the center.</i>

03:34.918 --> 03:39.187
<i>And Candy's Gold moves
along his outside.</i>

03:39.189 --> 03:41.889
<i>They come to the clubhouse
turn and it is Foley's Folly</i>

03:41.891 --> 03:43.624
- <i>by a nose to Dazzie.</i>
- _

03:43.626 --> 03:46.727
<i>Candy's Gold, again,
tracks them in third.</i>

03:46.729 --> 03:48.729
<i>Foley's Folly a opening quarter</i>

03:48.731 --> 03:52.233
<i>in 22.4 seconds.</i>

03:52.235 --> 03:54.035
<i>And they're on the back stretch now, and</i>

03:54.037 --> 03:56.737
<i>it is still Foley's Folly to Dazzie,
Candy's Gold,</i>

03:56.739 --> 03:59.874
<i>all hard along the rail,
at the top of the stretch.</i>

04:01.411 --> 04:03.444
<i>And it's Dazzie by a nose!</i>

04:04.808 --> 04:07.315
That sack of glue, Dazzie.

04:07.317 --> 04:09.217
Talk about a dark horse.

04:09.219 --> 04:11.452
Well, they're all dark
when you got no instinct.

04:11.454 --> 04:13.588
- That'll be a grand.
- Excuse me.

04:13.590 --> 04:15.990
<i>...today's seventh race.</i>

04:15.992 --> 04:18.291
Am I speaking with Dick Jankowski,

04:18.293 --> 04:20.595
Pamela Greiner, and Jack Swenson?

04:20.596 --> 04:23.664
Are you a cop, a lawyer, or both?

04:23.666 --> 04:25.066
A lawyer.

04:25.068 --> 04:27.068
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.

04:27.070 --> 04:30.104
I represent the estate of
the late Theodore Roberts.

04:30.106 --> 04:33.407
I'm looking for his cousin,
Cyril 'Cy' Roberts.

04:33.409 --> 04:34.842
What for?

04:34.844 --> 04:36.344
I'm afraid that's
attorney-client privilege.

04:36.346 --> 04:37.845
Do you know where I can find him?

04:37.847 --> 04:39.647
Well, I uh... I know a lot of things.

04:39.649 --> 04:43.417
I know that that briefcase
is brand-new and cheap.

04:43.419 --> 04:46.587
I also know that your
wig is a little weak.

04:46.589 --> 04:48.189
What do you know, Dick?

04:48.191 --> 04:49.657
I know you're not a lawyer,

04:49.659 --> 04:51.959
unless it's on "Law and Order:
Stripper Pole."

04:51.961 --> 04:53.628
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:54.212 --> 04:55.029
Jesus!

04:55.031 --> 04:57.031
Okay... okay! Okay, fine.

04:57.033 --> 04:59.800
I... I'm not a real lawyer.

04:59.802 --> 05:01.869
Good, 'cause that's not a real gun.

05:05.942 --> 05:07.675
Okay, that was fun.

05:07.677 --> 05:09.477
Why are you looking for Cy Roberts?

05:13.549 --> 05:17.818
Cy Roberts is my father.

05:20.623 --> 05:22.623
I don't know if you've met Cy yet,

05:22.625 --> 05:26.060
but, uh, he's not exactly
the fathering kind.

05:26.062 --> 05:27.795
What do you mean?

05:27.797 --> 05:31.232
Uh, so, you see,
Cy has a little mint on his breath,

05:31.234 --> 05:33.734
a little hello in his Dolly.

05:33.736 --> 05:35.469
- Huh?
- Jesus H.

05:35.471 --> 05:37.838
- What's my first name again?
- Dick.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.508
As in, "Cy Roberts likes..."

05:40.510 --> 05:41.742
Oh!

05:41.744 --> 05:44.045
Kay. Cool.

05:44.047 --> 05:46.814
Well, number one,
you should have seen my mom.

05:46.816 --> 05:49.717
And number two, Cy lost a bet to my mom,

05:49.719 --> 05:53.487
and, well,

05:53.489 --> 05:55.489
she wanted what she wanted.

05:55.491 --> 05:58.426
Cy Roberts always pays his debts.

06:00.063 --> 06:05.866
Truth is, I've been looking for this man
for a very, very long time,

06:05.868 --> 06:09.870
and I heard that he's
kind of a fixture here.

06:09.872 --> 06:12.740
If you know where I can find him,

06:12.742 --> 06:16.344
wouldn't you want to help a
girl finally meet her old man?

06:19.115 --> 06:20.514
Okay, kid.

06:20.516 --> 06:23.017
We can point you in the right direction,

06:23.019 --> 06:24.952
but we're not exactly sure

06:24.954 --> 06:29.090
what state he's going to be in
when you find him.

06:32.228 --> 06:34.228
I'm seeing who of my
Princeton classmates

06:34.230 --> 06:35.930
do business in Arizona.

06:35.932 --> 06:37.565
They'll know the power
brokers in the state.

06:37.567 --> 06:38.566
Cool.

06:38.568 --> 06:40.868
You know, I once sold a car
to the dean of Arizona State.

06:40.870 --> 06:44.405
Yeah, I'm looking for
a little more power in power brokering.

06:44.407 --> 06:46.207
Right, of course.

06:46.209 --> 06:50.411
So how long do you think
it will realistically take

06:50.413 --> 06:52.913
until I'm in the actual Senate senate?

06:52.915 --> 06:54.248
Oh, I don't know.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.250
Uh, Richard, can I talk to you?

06:56.252 --> 06:57.585
- Mm-hmm.
- Richard?

06:57.587 --> 06:59.420
- What?
- It's important, okay.

06:59.422 --> 07:02.156
Despite my sister's years of therapy,

07:02.158 --> 07:04.392
she still has a tendency to
make mountains out of molehills.

07:04.394 --> 07:06.327
My sister's nose is so high in the air,

07:06.329 --> 07:07.595
that Mount Everest
looks like a molehill.

07:07.597 --> 07:08.829
Whoa, hey, ladies, come on.

07:08.831 --> 07:10.664
I'm sorry, Jules, are you jealous?

07:10.666 --> 07:12.099
Richard, please, I need you right now.

07:12.101 --> 07:13.467
Wait, are you?

07:13.469 --> 07:15.136
- Are you kidding? Richard!
- See?

07:15.138 --> 07:17.471
Mountains, molehills.
Is this about the ring again?

07:17.473 --> 07:20.441
Hey, Jules, look, I think it's fine
that we lost the ring.

07:20.443 --> 07:21.942
- Okay, if we get...
- Jesus Christ!

07:21.944 --> 07:23.411
Have either of you
thought for one second

07:23.413 --> 07:25.780
why we haven't heard from Ezra,
who's been trying to rescue his family

07:25.782 --> 07:27.415
who have been held hostage?

07:27.417 --> 07:29.250
- Is Ezra okay?
- No, he is not okay.

07:29.252 --> 07:31.519
Okay? His father died.

07:31.521 --> 07:33.454
- Poor Ezra.
- Oh shit.

07:33.456 --> 07:36.490
Ezra said it was a heart attack,
but I don't really believe him,

07:36.492 --> 07:38.959
and I tried to find out more
information, and he hung up.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.928
Okay, that's really sad, but

07:40.930 --> 07:42.696
it's not like you even knew his dad, so.

07:42.698 --> 07:44.465
See, this is exactly my point.

07:44.467 --> 07:47.234
If it has nothing to do with her,
nothing matters.

07:47.236 --> 07:52.373
It's not so much the
point as it is a point,

07:52.375 --> 07:56.143
which is not to say
it's without a point.

08:22.839 --> 08:24.538
It's at least, uh...
at least about four square miles.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.040
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.843
What can I get you?

08:28.845 --> 08:30.845
Beer, your choice.

08:30.847 --> 08:32.546
I wouldn't advise that.

08:33.883 --> 08:35.515
Why not?

08:35.518 --> 08:37.518
So many things in life
are out of our hands.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.289
If you can make a choice, then make one.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.692
Actually, I'd like a Moody Ale, please.

08:44.694 --> 08:45.826
Got it.

08:45.828 --> 08:49.597
Strong. Definitive.

08:49.599 --> 08:51.532
Felt better, didn't it?

08:51.534 --> 08:54.535
I suppose it did.

08:54.537 --> 08:56.704
- Thanks.
- <i>Saluti.</i>

09:03.862 --> 09:07.462
I was the runt of the family.
Only girl, six kids.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.963
I had to claim respect.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.799
You're awfully tall for a runt.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.301
Claim respect? What does that mean?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.036
One example of many.

09:15.038 --> 09:17.405
In the park,
there was one of those mimes

09:17.407 --> 09:19.374
that stands as a statue
and collect money in a hat.

09:19.376 --> 09:21.242
My brothers used to get up in his face,

09:21.244 --> 09:22.710
trying to make him flinch.

09:22.712 --> 09:25.246
But he was good, stiff as a cliff.

09:25.248 --> 09:28.216
So I bet them each a year's
allowance that I could do it,

09:28.218 --> 09:29.217
but without touching him.

09:29.219 --> 09:30.318
- Did you?
- Mm.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.408
How?

09:31.788 --> 09:33.921
- I... took the hat.
- You took the hat.

09:34.828 --> 09:36.391
I'm the youngest, too.

09:36.393 --> 09:38.960
I have yet to claim any respect.

09:38.962 --> 09:42.263
It's never too late.
Any mimes in your neighborhood?

09:42.265 --> 09:43.931
Definitely not.

09:43.933 --> 09:46.000
Well, swift, brutal violence

09:46.002 --> 09:47.568
can be effective, sometimes.

09:52.475 --> 09:54.108
- Who's going to pick me up?
- I know, right?

09:54.110 --> 09:55.743
I don't think we need
the chicken and the...

09:55.745 --> 09:57.445
If that's what you're thinking,

09:57.447 --> 09:59.147
then why don't we just grab the one.

09:59.149 --> 10:01.449
I'm gonna run in.
Just put 'em in car is fine.

10:01.451 --> 10:03.184
- Okay, I appreciate that.
- Uh-huh.

10:04.654 --> 10:05.753
You know they got 'em on special.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.355
You want to get a large?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.856
Yeah, that sounds good.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.091
You go ahead and park.
I'll be right back.

10:11.327 --> 10:12.960
- Did you text her?
- Yeah.

10:12.962 --> 10:14.462
Yeah, she said she's gonna meet us.

10:14.464 --> 10:16.431
- Okay.
- Babe, let's launch it today.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.975
- Okay, what now?
- Just wait.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.998
Come on. Come on.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.701
Here you go.

10:53.703 --> 10:56.237
She's kidnapping a dog?

10:56.239 --> 10:58.172
Alright,
she's not leading us to the Doctor.

10:58.174 --> 10:59.540
She's lost her goddamn mind.

10:59.542 --> 11:00.808
I'm just going to arrest her.

11:04.529 --> 11:06.247
Seriously?

11:06.249 --> 11:10.084
I understand your concerns,
but we want the Doctor,

11:10.086 --> 11:12.253
so focus up.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.261
Okay, you're not like the vacationers.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.431
And you're definitely not a townie.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.699
Why are you here?

11:24.701 --> 11:26.100
That's funny.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.902
I'm usually the one
who asks that question.

11:27.904 --> 11:32.039
I show up when people
aren't doing their jobs.

11:32.041 --> 11:34.242
Sort of like a consultant.

11:34.244 --> 11:36.344
The word of a thousand meanings.

11:36.346 --> 11:38.045
What do you do?

11:38.047 --> 11:41.449
I correct people who are
in breach of contract.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.851
Why are you here?

11:43.853 --> 11:45.453
I'm on the run.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.088
Oh, interesting.

11:47.090 --> 11:50.758
So, you're a runner, and I'm a chaser.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.929
Fundamental differences,
yet here we sit.

11:54.931 --> 11:58.699
I believe in open dialogue
and mutual understanding.

11:58.701 --> 12:01.736
Little mouse isn't afraid
of the big, bad, cat?

12:01.738 --> 12:03.337
Jerry always gets away,

12:03.339 --> 12:05.373
and leaves Tom with a
mouthful of dynamite.

12:07.410 --> 12:08.876
Well said.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.613
_

12:13.616 --> 12:16.083
Hey, um,

12:16.085 --> 12:18.085
I don't know if you've
been getting my messages

12:18.087 --> 12:22.056
or if you're just pissed off
and ignoring them, but, um,

12:22.058 --> 12:26.327
my father died, and, um,

12:26.329 --> 12:27.995
and I called my friends, but

12:27.997 --> 12:30.264
I keep thinking of you,

12:30.266 --> 12:31.832
how you're the one I want to talk to,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.935
need to talk to.

12:33.937 --> 12:35.764
Is that weird? I don't know.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.239
Many things are weird, right now.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.541
Anyway, just put... ah, can you...

12:40.543 --> 12:43.477
just let me know if you get this.

12:43.479 --> 12:45.613
I'd really like to hear your voice.

12:45.615 --> 12:47.548
That's all.

12:48.918 --> 12:50.952
It's Ezra, by the way.

12:50.954 --> 12:52.150
Okay, bye.

13:28.858 --> 13:32.126
I'm so sorry, Ez.

13:32.128 --> 13:35.162
Sorry he didn't get to see you become

13:35.164 --> 13:37.965
the man you are becoming.

13:37.967 --> 13:42.970
Didn't get to see you marry again,
have children.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.790
They would have adored him.

13:48.845 --> 13:51.545
None of that will happen now,

13:51.547 --> 13:53.481
because of you.

13:56.686 --> 13:57.918
No, Ez.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.820
This one's all on you.

13:59.822 --> 14:02.423
Drop dead.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.491
Ezra?

14:05.995 --> 14:07.995
What the fuck happened?

14:16.798 --> 14:18.110
Tell me what happened, man.

14:18.112 --> 14:20.612
I can't, um,
I can't really talk about it.

14:20.614 --> 14:21.880
Are you serious?

14:21.882 --> 14:24.016
Dad's dead,

14:24.018 --> 14:26.852
and all you do is leave us a voicemail

14:26.854 --> 14:30.656
telling us not to call the cops?

14:30.658 --> 14:32.557
No, you have to tell me what happened.

14:32.559 --> 14:34.259
Mm, well, I'm kind of tired of
being told what I have to do.

14:34.261 --> 14:37.162
Did I overstep?

14:37.164 --> 14:39.998
Because I want to know why
my family was held hostage

14:40.000 --> 14:44.236
and why my father came
to a sudden early death.

14:44.238 --> 14:47.306
But I am so sorry,
I don't want to invade your privacy.

14:47.308 --> 14:48.607
Don't bully me. You're not Dad!

14:48.609 --> 14:50.609
Neither are you.

15:13.968 --> 15:17.002
I know I failed you guys.

15:17.004 --> 15:19.638
I failed Dad,

15:19.640 --> 15:22.708
and I can't ever make that right.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.810
But I'm gonna try.

15:24.812 --> 15:28.180
And, uh,

15:28.182 --> 15:30.082
this is for you,

15:30.084 --> 15:32.351
to read at the funeral.

15:35.622 --> 15:37.723
Please.

15:47.234 --> 15:49.668
Where's Mom?

15:50.804 --> 15:52.637
Other than being on the road,

15:52.639 --> 15:54.740
what brings you here?

15:54.742 --> 15:56.408
Let me guess.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.044
Local-born,
world traveling forward thinker

15:59.046 --> 16:03.148
returning home to humble roots?

16:03.150 --> 16:06.752
Rebel scion of old money
doing a Thoreau thing?

16:06.754 --> 16:10.922
Neither, but closer to the second one,
unfortunately.

16:10.924 --> 16:12.824
Why unfortunately?

16:12.826 --> 16:15.994
Being the scion of an old money
family is a pretty good gig,

16:15.996 --> 16:18.997
unless you suffer from the
heartbreak of inherited wealth.

16:18.999 --> 16:20.032
Maybe.

16:20.034 --> 16:21.700
Seeing as that I've never

16:21.702 --> 16:24.202
accomplished anything
on my own my entire life.

16:24.204 --> 16:25.771
Kind of pathetic.

16:25.773 --> 16:28.240
- Arousing pity.
- I'm sorry?

16:28.242 --> 16:30.575
Arousing pity.
Pathetic means arousing pity.

16:30.577 --> 16:32.077
You're not pitiful,
I don't pity you, anyway.

16:32.079 --> 16:33.412
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

16:33.414 --> 16:35.914
I'm privileged and I sound whiny.

16:35.916 --> 16:37.783
- I... I...
- Shh. Now you sound whiny.

16:37.785 --> 16:39.084
- Cut it out.
- Okay.

16:39.086 --> 16:40.452
There are well-off people I pity.

16:40.454 --> 16:41.887
You're just not one of them.

16:41.889 --> 16:43.855
Do you care to elaborate on that?

16:43.857 --> 16:46.091
Must I?

16:46.093 --> 16:47.959
Well, if I must.

16:47.961 --> 16:49.961
Granted, I've only known you
for a short time...

16:49.963 --> 16:52.197
lovely time, though it's been.

16:52.199 --> 16:53.965
You're bright and

16:53.967 --> 16:56.435
relatively interesting
for a younger person,

16:56.437 --> 16:58.937
and may well blossom into
a fully fledged human

16:58.939 --> 17:02.941
if you can avoid tumbling
into the abyss of your own self regard.

17:02.943 --> 17:05.609
Now, I pity the duds.

17:05.612 --> 17:07.746
You're not a dud.

17:07.748 --> 17:10.248
You're so weird.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.217
- I like it.
- I don't care.

17:12.219 --> 17:13.984
- Advice?
- Please.

17:13.987 --> 17:15.487
Whatever's torturing you,

17:15.489 --> 17:17.289
whatever secret you've
got stuffed down there

17:17.290 --> 17:19.758
in your bottom drawer,
lay your burden down.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.226
It's not that bad.

17:21.228 --> 17:23.428
How do you know it's not that bad?

17:23.430 --> 17:25.297
Try me.

17:46.653 --> 17:49.855
Hey, why do you and Jules fight so much?

17:49.857 --> 17:52.090
I think it's really because
I'm always there to save her.

17:52.092 --> 17:54.793
- Save her from what?
- Herself.

17:54.795 --> 17:57.095
Getting her out of Mexico illegally?

17:57.097 --> 17:58.763
That was like two days ago.

17:58.765 --> 18:00.465
She didn't resent you before that?

18:00.467 --> 18:02.000
Come on.

18:06.039 --> 18:09.508
She cannot know I am telling
you this terrible story, yes?

18:09.510 --> 18:12.110
Uh-huh.

18:15.682 --> 18:18.783
When Jules was at RISD, she had this

18:18.785 --> 18:21.219
psycho Goth-type roommate.

18:21.221 --> 18:24.055
We were super tight,
and then we'd fight,

18:24.057 --> 18:27.659
and then we'd be friends again,
and it went around and around.

18:27.661 --> 18:33.230
Intense and unhealthy, I guess.

18:33.734 --> 18:38.136
She was diagnosed bipolar
right before our senior year,

18:38.138 --> 18:41.640
and they seemed to have it
under control for awhile, but...

18:41.642 --> 18:44.242
She was a genius.

18:44.244 --> 18:47.179
Her work was always so surprising.

18:47.181 --> 18:48.680
<i>I could tell Jules was jealous,</i>

18:48.682 --> 18:50.248
which I told her not to be,

18:50.250 --> 18:52.184
because clearly her
roommate was troubled.

18:52.186 --> 18:54.419
And as the troubled are wont to do,

18:54.421 --> 18:56.922
one day she just jumped off the roof.

18:56.924 --> 18:58.823
Or out a window.

18:59.575 --> 19:00.559
Something horrible.

19:00.561 --> 19:04.162
For weeks,
I was in a kind of dream-state,

19:04.164 --> 19:05.997
a nightmare.

19:05.999 --> 19:09.167
And I was behind in my schoolwork.

19:09.169 --> 19:10.936
Graduation was looming,

19:10.938 --> 19:14.372
I completely dropped the ball
on my senior thesis project.

19:14.374 --> 19:16.942
So Jules took her dead
roommate's project,

19:16.944 --> 19:18.643
and presented it as her own.

19:18.645 --> 19:23.215
I stole part of her project,
and I told myself that

19:23.217 --> 19:26.418
it was inspired by
our conversations and our friendship,

19:26.420 --> 19:28.753
so in a way, I had a right to it.

19:28.755 --> 19:30.589
<i>Obviously, a shitty thing to do, but</i>

19:30.591 --> 19:32.190
doesn't really matter considering

19:32.192 --> 19:34.025
the aforementioned jumping
out the window thing,

19:34.027 --> 19:35.694
except she got caught.

19:35.696 --> 19:39.731
I was humiliated, terrified,

19:39.733 --> 19:42.968
and my family swooped in to fix it.

19:42.970 --> 19:46.438
Jules desperately needed
my help getting her life back together.

19:46.440 --> 19:51.243
I was willing to take
the punishment, all of it.

19:51.245 --> 19:54.546
And then my... my sister,

19:54.548 --> 19:57.916
she just worked on me.

19:57.918 --> 19:59.651
And she just wore me down.

19:59.653 --> 20:02.687
Which is what she does,
she wears you down.

20:02.689 --> 20:07.092
She was selfish and stubborn,

20:07.094 --> 20:08.493
but I persisted.

20:08.495 --> 20:09.361
And I...

20:10.163 --> 20:16.101
know I shouldn't blame my family
for how they helped, but I do.

20:16.103 --> 20:19.971
And I can't forgive
myself for allowing it.

20:22.843 --> 20:24.576
It's not so bad.

20:24.578 --> 20:28.313
You were young and stupid
and killed your roommate, took her art.

20:28.315 --> 20:29.681
- Okay.
- What?

20:29.683 --> 20:31.783
No... I didn't kill her.

20:31.785 --> 20:33.084
You didn't kill her?

20:33.086 --> 20:36.121
You didn't push her off the roof
literally or metaphorically?

20:36.123 --> 20:37.856
Umm, no.

20:37.858 --> 20:40.125
Then, what is your problem?

20:40.127 --> 20:41.960
I have to live my life knowing that

20:41.962 --> 20:44.362
I owe my career...
if you can even call it that...

20:44.364 --> 20:46.364
to my family getting me
off the fucking hook.

20:46.366 --> 20:48.667
If you insist on looking
through a moral point of view,

20:48.669 --> 20:51.169
what you did wrong was you stole, right?

20:51.171 --> 20:52.699
Whether you got help or not...

20:52.706 --> 20:54.039
is neither here nor there.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.674
But I should have been punished

20:55.676 --> 20:57.942
by the school, by my peers.

20:57.944 --> 21:01.980
You seem to be doing a very
good job of that on your own.

21:01.982 --> 21:05.150
I know a lot about punishment.

21:05.152 --> 21:08.053
The punisher, the punished,
the one who says,

21:08.055 --> 21:12.157
"That's enough. Off you go."

21:12.159 --> 21:14.693
You're the punisher, and the punished.

21:14.695 --> 21:19.164
Are you the one who says,
"That's enough?"

21:19.166 --> 21:21.232
I don't know.

21:21.234 --> 21:23.068
Jules Langmore.

21:23.070 --> 21:25.737
Yes?

21:25.739 --> 21:31.009
That's enough. Off you go.

21:32.512 --> 21:35.180
So that's what's in Jules' envelope?

21:35.182 --> 21:36.548
What envelope?

21:36.550 --> 21:40.518
God, it must have been awful for her.

21:40.520 --> 21:44.022
Yeah, well,
Jules got to play the martyr.

21:44.024 --> 21:46.591
But the truth is I basically rode in
on a white fucking horse.

21:46.593 --> 21:48.326
I took off three weeks of work for that.

21:48.328 --> 21:50.228
It sounds like she just
wanted to take responsibility.

21:50.230 --> 21:52.897
- Mm.
- I mean, she made a mistake.

21:52.899 --> 21:54.999
And, you know...

21:55.001 --> 21:56.634
You're not listening.

21:58.305 --> 22:01.139
Wait, you took your sex selfie of us?

22:03.510 --> 22:05.176
It's hot.

22:05.178 --> 22:08.246
Wait, you sent it to some... Who's HBY?

22:08.248 --> 22:11.383
Hlby? Hbyla?

22:11.385 --> 22:13.785
"Hubby."

22:13.787 --> 22:17.355
- As in "husband."
- Oh Jesus, dude.

22:17.357 --> 22:19.124
You said you guys were strange, but...

22:19.126 --> 22:21.059
Estranged. I said "estranged."

22:21.061 --> 22:23.962
So, this whole time, you were just

22:23.964 --> 22:25.363
thinking about him or what?

22:25.365 --> 22:27.198
Don't. Just, uh...

22:27.200 --> 22:29.968
don't do the whole jealousy thing.

22:29.970 --> 22:31.336
It's boring.

22:31.338 --> 22:33.738
- Oh, it's boring?
- Exhausting.

22:33.740 --> 22:35.407
You were using me to get back at him?

22:35.632 --> 22:36.474
"Using."

22:36.476 --> 22:39.744
It's such a crass word.

22:39.746 --> 22:42.447
I wasn't using you. I was enjoying you.

22:42.449 --> 22:45.617
We were enjoying each other,

22:45.619 --> 22:48.219
until now.

22:48.221 --> 22:52.123
Look, I'm not above
some revenge sex, okay?

22:52.125 --> 22:53.792
It's just, Alice and I,

22:53.794 --> 22:56.294
we had a... a chance
at something, and I thought...

22:56.296 --> 22:58.263
No, no. Don't overthink it.

22:58.265 --> 23:00.999
- You're just like Jules.
- What?

23:01.001 --> 23:03.668
That is, like,
the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

23:03.670 --> 23:06.438
Well, you're both just so thinky.

23:06.440 --> 23:10.809
Look, Lazlo's sad and in Paris.

23:10.811 --> 23:12.777
It's just sort of a
resistible combination.

23:12.779 --> 23:15.146
Mm. Well, maybe I was using you.

23:15.148 --> 23:17.148
Great. Yeah, happy to be used.

23:17.150 --> 23:18.583
Good.

23:18.585 --> 23:23.054
I will remember our time together
with enormous fondness.

23:30.029 --> 23:30.929
Okay.

23:37.871 --> 23:40.438
Well.

23:40.440 --> 23:43.508
Thanks for the ride and
talking and everything.

23:43.510 --> 23:45.877
Don't you get scared in
that big old spooky house?

23:45.879 --> 23:47.479
Eh, my pals are with me.

23:47.481 --> 23:49.347
Oh, it's nice to meet
my new friend's friends.

23:49.349 --> 23:50.949
Let's have dinner.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.051
- Okay.
- I'm a dynamite cook.

23:53.053 --> 23:54.786
Great.

23:54.788 --> 23:56.788
See you soon, macaroon!

24:05.131 --> 24:07.332
Sister, I must <i>andiamo.</i>

24:07.334 --> 24:09.734
I hope you don't mind if I take the car?

24:09.736 --> 24:12.070
Texts and pics, please, okay?

24:12.072 --> 24:13.505
Kisses.

24:18.095 --> 24:19.077
Poor Richie.

24:37.380 --> 24:39.301
Poppy Langmore got you down?

24:39.303 --> 24:42.371
No, I'm all right..

24:42.373 --> 24:44.640
- I think...
- Yeah, I know she's not Alice.

24:44.642 --> 24:46.208
And Alice is fake anyway.

24:46.210 --> 24:49.778
But I saw her and we clicked

24:49.780 --> 24:53.248
and she was all...

24:53.250 --> 24:55.584
you know, whatever she is.

24:55.586 --> 24:57.986
Maybe I got a little ahead
of myself, so what?

24:57.988 --> 24:59.388
- I'm not saying...
- I know.

24:59.390 --> 25:04.459
I don't need a, like, wife/cheerleader
to accomplish what I want in life, or

25:04.461 --> 25:09.264
have to be the great-grandson
of a baron or whatever.

25:09.266 --> 25:11.400
I'ma get it done, believe it.

25:11.402 --> 25:14.836
I believe it, Richard.

25:14.838 --> 25:17.706
I do.

25:18.776 --> 25:22.744
Governor Langmore wasn't really a baron.

25:22.746 --> 25:26.581
He was a Scottish immigrant,
and he made up the baron part,

25:26.583 --> 25:28.617
and only later became governor.

25:30.954 --> 25:33.522
She said you and I are alike.

25:33.524 --> 25:35.824
That's the weirdest
thing I've ever heard.

25:38.829 --> 25:40.996
There's not, like, another sister?

25:40.998 --> 25:43.632
Nope, that's it.

25:43.634 --> 25:46.334
Thank God.

25:57.581 --> 25:59.548
We're here. We're here!

25:59.550 --> 26:02.384
Oh gosh, that traffic, I tell you.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.653
You know that they had me
turning around on McGregor?

26:04.655 --> 26:07.222
Oh, gosh. Do you mind holding him?

26:07.224 --> 26:09.524
- Oh my god, of course.
- Sorry to trouble you.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.426
I just need two hands
for one quick text.

26:11.428 --> 26:13.128
- Aww.
- Yeah, okay.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.831
- Aww, he likes you.
- Oh.

26:15.833 --> 26:18.033
Okay, come on buddy.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.035
There we go,
'cause we can't believe we're

26:20.037 --> 26:22.671
late for our very first session, can we?

26:22.673 --> 26:24.372
- Oh is it dog therapy?
- Yes.

26:24.374 --> 26:28.410
Jenny Anne Brown and Freddy
from Bark Who Goes There, 2:00 p.m.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.911
- Hold on.
- I tell you,

26:29.913 --> 26:32.047
we never come this far from Springfield,

26:32.049 --> 26:36.184
but Mr. Roberts saw a picture
of this little cutie-patootie online,

26:36.186 --> 26:37.919
and he just had to... What's wrong?

26:37.921 --> 26:40.589
- I don't see you listed.
- Oh.

26:40.591 --> 26:42.324
Well just try under Freddy, maybe?

26:42.326 --> 26:44.025
I'm sorry, you're not on the list.

26:44.027 --> 26:45.327
I can't let you in.

26:45.329 --> 26:47.562
Oh.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.365
Oh, no. I, uh...

26:50.367 --> 26:54.436
I bet Mr. Roberts forgot to confirm.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.771
It's all right, okay.

26:55.773 --> 26:57.739
Here we go. Back in the truck we go.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.842
I know, they would have
loved you, Freddy.

27:00.844 --> 27:04.412
They really would have loved you.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.681
Wait.

27:06.683 --> 27:08.416
Which resident were you booked to see?

27:08.418 --> 27:10.952
Roberts. Cy Roberts.

27:10.954 --> 27:14.022
Okay.

27:24.802 --> 27:26.268
Hello, Cy.

27:37.915 --> 27:40.615
Hmm, well,

27:40.617 --> 27:43.385
isn't this a shit state of affairs?

27:43.387 --> 27:45.487
I was really looking
forward to meeting you.

27:45.489 --> 27:49.791
I mean, you are, after all,
the reason I am what I am.

27:52.062 --> 27:55.096
You know, Max Grochev
brought me into the game.

27:56.733 --> 28:01.336
The way he used to talk about you,
this would break his little heart.

28:01.338 --> 28:02.904
But it's alright, it's okay.

28:02.906 --> 28:04.639
I'm not leaving empty-handed.

28:04.641 --> 28:09.144
I am, after all, a con artist,

28:09.146 --> 28:10.979
like you.

28:10.981 --> 28:14.616
Darling, there's never been
a con artist like me.

28:14.618 --> 28:15.684
I know.

28:15.686 --> 28:17.285
May I have my wallet back?

28:20.991 --> 28:24.025
Outside pocket. Sloppy.

28:24.697 --> 28:26.962
It wasn't sloppy. It was bait.

28:26.964 --> 28:28.964
You mind putting my stuff back, too?

28:28.966 --> 28:32.200
You want a gin and tonic?
I make my own tonic.

28:33.143 --> 28:35.370
Don't ask how.

28:35.372 --> 28:37.138
Delighted.

28:37.140 --> 28:40.375
So, how are old Max and Sally?

28:40.377 --> 28:43.144
They ever tie the knot
and become official?

28:43.406 --> 28:44.708
Sally's dead.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.517
Natural causes?

28:49.519 --> 28:51.258
What do you think?

28:54.191 --> 28:56.358
What is it you want, darling?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.827
Freedom, from the Doctor...

28:59.880 --> 29:00.629
Like you have.

29:00.631 --> 29:03.064
Oh, well,
who do you think pays the bills?

29:03.066 --> 29:06.835
I'm a bird in a gilded cage,

29:06.837 --> 29:08.236
such as it is.

29:09.583 --> 29:10.739
Here.

29:10.741 --> 29:13.909
Why would he keep you here?

29:13.911 --> 29:17.245
Because he can't let anything go.

29:17.247 --> 29:20.982
When I, uh, began to see the direction

29:20.984 --> 29:22.717
that he was taking the game,

29:22.719 --> 29:28.089
the sadism and the brutality
and the distinct lack of elegance,

29:28.091 --> 29:33.495
I offered a handshake and a buy-out,
and he said, "No. No."

29:35.265 --> 29:38.166
He has things on me,
like he probably does on you.

29:38.168 --> 29:39.868
He wants to keep me here.

29:39.870 --> 29:43.171
At least I'm above ground. Yeah.

29:43.173 --> 29:45.907
Then help me find a way
to end this for both of us.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.909
What, and give up all of this?

29:49.046 --> 29:50.879
For all I know,

29:50.881 --> 29:54.916
you could have been sent
by the sadist himself.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.886
Hmm? A little test.

29:57.888 --> 30:01.423
And for all I know, as soon as I leave,
you pick up the phone and sell me out.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.224
No. No.

30:03.226 --> 30:05.927
What can you tell me about him?

30:05.929 --> 30:09.264
All right, darling.

30:09.266 --> 30:13.868
Well, he's, uh, prideful and arrogant.

30:13.870 --> 30:16.404
That usually makes for a good mark.

30:16.406 --> 30:20.475
Yes, I know all that,
but I need to find him.

30:20.477 --> 30:23.278
The truth is, after all these years,

30:23.280 --> 30:28.650
I've never even learned his name.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.953
Now I do know that he is a real doctor,

30:31.955 --> 30:34.322
and he practices in Buffalo,

30:34.324 --> 30:37.292
but that is it, that's all I got.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.227
He's that good.

30:42.265 --> 30:43.665
Here you go, puppy.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.701
I got a... a word of advice for you.

30:46.703 --> 30:49.404
You seem like the, uh, independent type,

30:49.406 --> 30:52.407
but if you're going to try and do
what I think you're gonna do,

30:52.409 --> 30:53.575
don't do it alone.

30:53.577 --> 30:54.876
You're gonna need help.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.613
Yeah.

30:58.615 --> 31:01.349
Now, you have your... your hands full.

31:01.351 --> 31:03.018
Why don't you just leave the puppy?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.887
I'll return him for you.

31:05.889 --> 31:08.423
Oh.

31:08.425 --> 31:09.958
Nice try.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.260
Don't be a stranger.

31:19.302 --> 31:22.470
Hey, they want us back inside.

31:22.472 --> 31:25.373
Stay on her. I'll go see what's what.

31:26.476 --> 31:27.842
Can you guys help me out?

31:27.844 --> 31:29.310
Yeah... hold on.
Let me get the gate down.

31:29.312 --> 31:30.845
- One second.
- All right.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.881
Here we go, one, two, three.

31:32.883 --> 31:35.150
Yeah. Ah, thank you.

31:38.488 --> 31:39.654
Cy Roberts?

31:39.656 --> 31:41.456
Daphne.

31:41.458 --> 31:45.126
Did you fire the gardener?
He's a menace.

31:56.807 --> 32:00.608
Come with me, dear.
Let's help you find your room.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.054
So who was that guy?

32:09.056 --> 32:10.314
If he was a relative,

32:10.391 --> 32:14.559
she wouldn't need to
steal a dog to get to him.

32:14.561 --> 32:18.430
Well, maybe she's working him. Must be.

32:18.432 --> 32:21.533
For what? His collection of slippers?

32:28.742 --> 32:32.143
You know, I think
she's probably in for the night.

32:32.145 --> 32:34.145
Why don't you go ahead
and get a room, sack out?

32:34.147 --> 32:35.280
I'll cover.

32:35.282 --> 32:37.649
- You sure?
- Yeah.

32:47.256 --> 32:47.959
Hey, Mina.

32:47.961 --> 32:49.961
<i>- Mm-hmm. Are you...</i>
- Yeah, Simons.

32:49.963 --> 32:54.466
Yeah, yeah, enjoying
some much needed time off.

32:54.468 --> 32:55.976
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

32:56.703 --> 32:59.371
So, listen, I need you
to key up a device for me.

33:00.582 --> 33:01.940
Yeah.

33:01.942 --> 33:04.776
Yeah, yeah, I guess
we're always working, right?

33:04.778 --> 33:05.948
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:07.314 --> 33:08.780
Hey, could you do me a favor?

33:08.782 --> 33:10.448
Could you keep this one off the books?

33:10.450 --> 33:13.518
<i>- Yeah, that's all right.</i>
- Okay great.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.053
I'll send you my coordinates.

33:17.324 --> 33:18.268
Come here.

33:28.038 --> 33:30.038
_

33:30.553 --> 33:32.774
_

33:42.983 --> 33:47.252
Hello?

33:47.254 --> 33:49.621
- Ezra?
<i>- Interesting.</i>

33:50.350 --> 33:53.358
So you guys been in touch
this whole time?

33:53.360 --> 33:55.860
Patrick?

33:55.862 --> 33:57.862
<i>You know, I was wondering,</i>

33:57.864 --> 34:01.900
when you kissed him at our sham wedding,

34:01.902 --> 34:03.702
<i>was that real or just for the con?</i>

34:03.704 --> 34:05.437
Does it really matter?

34:05.439 --> 34:07.872
<i>And when you asked me
to run away with you,</i>

34:07.874 --> 34:09.206
<i>was that real?</i>

34:09.208 --> 34:12.077
'Cause I've analyzed it, and I just...

34:12.079 --> 34:14.846
I can't see the angle.

34:14.848 --> 34:18.049
How about we do a rundown of every time
you kissed me and told me you love me,

34:18.051 --> 34:20.885
'cause that felt pretty
freaking real to me.

34:20.887 --> 34:22.786
I was doing my job, Maddie.

34:22.789 --> 34:24.215
Why ask if it was real, then?

34:24.291 --> 34:28.025
Just making sure you're safe.
I wanted to hear your voice.

34:28.027 --> 34:29.893
I'm great. Where are you calling from?

34:29.896 --> 34:32.563
<i>I may be getting closer and closer.</i>

34:32.565 --> 34:37.034
- What the hell are you doing?
- Uh...

34:37.036 --> 34:38.737
I'm just making a quick call.

34:38.739 --> 34:41.239
There was no service inside,
so, you know,

34:41.241 --> 34:42.242
I had to...

34:42.643 --> 34:44.643
All right, look,
don't misunderstand this.

34:44.645 --> 34:47.078
Exactly what have I not understood?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.580
That you're leading this
mission with your dick?

34:48.581 --> 34:50.114
Or that you just blew our cover?

34:50.117 --> 34:52.650
- No, that is all calculated.
- Bullshit.

34:52.652 --> 34:54.719
She will never lead us to the Doctor.

34:54.721 --> 34:56.920
Listen, Agent Cook,
I understand your perspective,

34:56.922 --> 35:00.592
I really do, but maybe
your methods are just a little outdated?

35:00.594 --> 35:03.261
I'm working something here.
I'm flushing her out.

35:03.263 --> 35:06.564
I'd closed 50 cases while
your mother was still wiping your ass,

35:06.566 --> 35:07.966
and I outrank you.

35:07.968 --> 35:09.434
Okay.

35:09.436 --> 35:12.170
Now, all due respect,
you don't outrank anybody.

35:12.172 --> 35:14.906
All right? You're retired, remember?

35:14.908 --> 35:17.609
That's right. I am.

35:17.611 --> 35:19.978
And I prefer piña coladas,
bingo, and my Jerry

35:19.980 --> 35:21.980
over this bullshit any day.

35:21.982 --> 35:24.482
I'm going home tomorrow.
Good night, agent.

35:58.919 --> 36:01.019
<i>Thank you all for being here.</i>

36:01.021 --> 36:04.289
It means a great deal to us,
and to our family.

36:04.291 --> 36:08.960
Unlike my dad, I'm not great with words.

36:08.962 --> 36:10.895
But, uh,

36:10.897 --> 36:14.132
other people in the family
have inherited that trait,

36:14.134 --> 36:16.701
luckily, so.

36:19.306 --> 36:22.073
I knew this day would come.

36:22.075 --> 36:24.509
But life has a way of surprising you

36:24.511 --> 36:27.579
even with the things you've
always known would happen.

36:27.581 --> 36:29.247
And here we are,

36:29.249 --> 36:34.385
surprised and shocked
by this deep, unfair loss.

36:34.387 --> 36:36.988
This dreaded day.

36:36.990 --> 36:40.225
As I write this, I expect
to hear his booming voice.

36:40.227 --> 36:42.594
He argued big.

36:42.596 --> 36:46.598
He laughed big. He loved big.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.466
He told big stories.

36:48.468 --> 36:50.668
He told us, as kids,

36:50.670 --> 36:55.373
that the reason we dip hard-boiled eggs
in salt water at Passover

36:55.375 --> 36:57.509
is that when the Red Sea parted,

36:57.511 --> 37:03.181
the water was just high enough to graze
the balls of the slaves as they escaped.

37:03.183 --> 37:05.884
Ask the Rabbi about that one.

37:05.886 --> 37:07.786
And we did.

37:07.788 --> 37:09.621
And then Dad got a call.

37:11.391 --> 37:15.393
He taught us so much,
about being a father,

37:15.395 --> 37:18.363
a husband,

37:18.365 --> 37:20.298
a man,

37:20.300 --> 37:22.133
about making mistakes,

37:22.135 --> 37:23.635
and learning,

37:23.637 --> 37:26.137
and continuing to move forward.

37:33.914 --> 37:36.147
Even on this day,

37:36.149 --> 37:39.918
this impossible day,

37:39.920 --> 37:42.620
he wouldn't want us to dwell,

37:42.622 --> 37:45.323
but to push on.

37:45.325 --> 37:48.459
Let the past be the past.

37:48.461 --> 37:53.131
Let it not be a headwind
that holds us back,

37:53.133 --> 37:57.335
but a tailwind that pushes us forward.

38:04.110 --> 38:06.578
Look at that, Dad.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.813
You get to be pushy to the end.

38:13.653 --> 38:16.154
Poor Arthur.

38:16.156 --> 38:18.690
Why'd he have to go and do
something stupid like that?

38:18.692 --> 38:21.025
Ah!

38:21.027 --> 38:23.828
He was protecting the people he loved.

38:23.830 --> 38:26.164
Most people do that, Maxie.

38:26.166 --> 38:29.167
You know, we always thought
people like that were chumps?

38:29.169 --> 38:31.202
But when you betrayed me and

38:31.204 --> 38:36.174
left me at the Doctor's mercy,
I realized the joke's on us.

38:36.176 --> 38:38.209
I was dead to the world.

38:38.211 --> 38:42.013
Nobody cared, except maybe Maddie.

38:48.822 --> 38:50.788
- We gotta move her...
- Shh, shh, shh.

39:00.901 --> 39:03.768
<i>Hello, Ezra. This is the Doctor.</i>

39:09.164 --> 39:13.768
<i>Ezra, I want to express my condolences
on the loss of your father.</i>

39:13.770 --> 39:17.838
<i>Max and Sally described to me
how he violently attacked them.</i>

39:17.840 --> 39:19.640
<i>Ill advised.</i>

39:19.642 --> 39:23.010
<i>And such an awful
unintended consequence.</i>

39:23.012 --> 39:25.346
<i>If he'd only done as he was told.</i>

39:25.348 --> 39:29.550
<i>Well, not his strong suit I guess.</i>

39:29.552 --> 39:32.987
<i>Now, you and Julia and Richard,</i>

39:32.989 --> 39:35.856
<i>until further notice,</i>

39:35.858 --> 39:37.692
<i>you work for me.</i>

39:37.694 --> 39:39.493
<i>Max and Sally will drop you
at Langmore Cabin,</i>

39:39.495 --> 39:41.996
<i>and I will send a welcome
package soon after.</i>

39:41.998 --> 39:44.799
<i>Follow the instructions, do not deviate,</i>

39:44.801 --> 39:48.636
<i>and these unintended consequences
can hopefully be avoided.</i>

39:48.638 --> 39:50.037
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

39:50.352 --> 39:51.472
<i>Or not.</i>

39:55.178 --> 39:56.610
We thought the worst.

39:56.612 --> 39:58.879
Thank God for people like you.

39:58.881 --> 40:00.781
You... you really
don't have to say that...

40:00.783 --> 40:02.350
But I have to.

40:02.352 --> 40:04.318
Thank the wonderful lady, Culley.

40:09.926 --> 40:12.059
Boop.

40:26.808 --> 40:29.315

40:35.986 --> 40:37.986

40:43.592 --> 40:48.164

41:32.175 --> 41:33.674
Hey.

41:33.676 --> 41:36.277
- Ezra.
- You made it.
