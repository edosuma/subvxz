WEBVTT

00:00.534 --> 00:03.703
Oh, man. Where are we?

00:03.770 --> 00:05.439
We are in Hollywood.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.515
Here we go.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.531
Where we at?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.420
-Thanks for picking me up.
-Of course.

01:26.486 --> 01:31.558
Even though I don't really like
driving with you driving.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.193
I prefer me driving.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.394
-OK.
-I trust myself.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.096
Well, we can switch up.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.565
-Yeah, that's definitely safer, but--
-Yes.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.401
You know, I was mad
you beat me at that competition

01:41.468 --> 01:44.271
on the radio
where our songs were battling.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.139
I was real mad.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.008
You've been beating me
for so long, Alicia.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.878
You got more record sales than me.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.546
-You got more Grammys than me.
-You know that.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.149
-I'm keeping it real. I'm keeping it real.
-That really makes you mad, doesn't it?

01:56.216 --> 01:58.318
-I needed one win.
-All right, we're good.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.556
-That makes us have to sing a song.
-Yeah, exactly.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.558
Let's sing one of your songs first.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.193
Whoa, whoa. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.595
Pause.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.663
Hold up.

02:13.433 --> 02:17.271
-Sorry. I need a click.
-We do need to click.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.340
One, two, three.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.868
Oh, yeah.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.196
Break it down.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.103
It's hard to sing and drive.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.005
-I love it.
-You always do it?

03:58.105 --> 04:00.474
Yeah, my dad--
he got me doing that.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.709
He used to car dance
and sing all the time.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.744
He can car dance, though?

04:03.810 --> 04:06.580
He would drive and dance
and sing and do the whole thing.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.482
You can definitely car dance.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.785
Now, how many times
has someone sung that

04:11.852 --> 04:13.854
on a singing competition show?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.455
I think it's this one that they banned.

04:15.522 --> 04:19.059
-At The Voice or where did they ban it?
-I think all singing competitions

04:19.059 --> 04:21.261
across the board unanimously

04:21.327 --> 04:23.697
has banned "Fallin'".

04:23.764 --> 04:25.933
Simon banned "Ordinary People",
I think, from X Factor.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.235
Oh, but that's such a good song.

04:28.302 --> 04:31.205
It's a good competition song too.
But Simon, man, you know.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.207
He's always cranky.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.952
Who is that guy?

04:45.986 --> 04:48.088
-He is serious.
-Yeah.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.124
Wait.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.326
It looks like James.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.597
James.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.365
Hey!

04:58.432 --> 04:59.867
What are you doing?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.635
I'm just working out.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.237
Just going at it pretty hard.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.239
You wouldn't be able to give me a lift?
I'm pretty exhausted.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.640
-Sure. Come on in.
-Is that all right?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.809
Oh, well, this is such fun.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.410
-Hey-hey!.
-James!

05:10.477 --> 05:11.912
-Here we go.
-What's going on?

05:12.045 --> 05:15.749
-And we're in. How are you?
-Good to see you, brother.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.287
So, John, if I'm honest,
I'm surprised I recognised your face,

05:20.354 --> 05:23.457
because if I think of John Legend,

05:23.524 --> 05:26.059
I only really think of this picture.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.962
Why-- You had to bring that one out.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.698
-Well, no, I'm just saying. That's--
-What is that?

05:31.765 --> 05:33.066
-It's---
-I don't know.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.936
-I mean, but look at that. It's beautiful.
-Pretty good, John.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.572
-It's a surreptitious shot my wife took.
-Oh, John, come on.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.909
-Like you're trying to hide it.
-We were both drunk in Paris,

05:41.975 --> 05:45.279
-and things got out of hand, and--
-And she posted it?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.947
-We were-- Yeah.
-That is the biggest humble brag.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.083
-We regretted it the next morning, but--
-Are you joking? You regretted it?

05:50.150 --> 05:53.787
If I had that butt
I would never wear pants.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.590
I would wear assless chaps

05:56.657 --> 05:59.426
all day and night
if I was rocking that ass.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.535
Turn it up, John.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.555
That's right.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.575
Sing, James.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.071
Yeah, take it. Go on.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.492
Oh, big tune, gang.
Big tune.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.028
-We gotta form a band!
-You got harmonies.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.496
Come on, this is the start of a band.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.198
-Back there doing the thing.
-James can sing.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.100
Surely this is the start of a band.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.103
You're both ignoring my starting a band.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.349
What song would you put on, John--

08:35.414 --> 08:38.452
Hypothetically, if you were married
and you had two kids,

08:38.519 --> 08:40.587
and you were from Britain
living in Los Angeles,

08:40.654 --> 08:43.190
and you were going through
a dry patch at home,

08:43.256 --> 08:46.393
what song would you put on
to get stuff going?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.861
I'm ready to play it for you, John.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.897
-What song would you play?
-I love me some Marvin.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.365
-That's what I like.
-Oh, really?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.901
Do you mean of his songs
or of any songs in the world?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.936
Well, of his songs, it's "All Of Me".

08:56.069 --> 08:58.071
-That's the one.
-What? I don't think that's a sex song.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.439
No, but it's-- it is, though.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.842
-That's a romance song.
-That's what I mean, it's romance.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.211
-It's a love song.
-It's passion. It's close.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.013
Yeah, but if you wanna, like, get down,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.081
you don't want it to be
too tender of a ballad.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.750
You want it to have some groove to it.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.885
See, this is it.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.454
I think you come in,
you take the tie off,

09:14.521 --> 09:17.191
you drop the bottle of wine
on the table and you say, "Baby..."

10:49.216 --> 10:51.518
-Yeah!
-I mean, come on, gang.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.487
Whoo! That was good vibes right there.

10:53.554 --> 10:56.790
I swear to God, you two,
you have such incredible voices.

10:56.857 --> 11:00.928
There's literally nothing you can't sing
and it won't sound good.

11:01.061 --> 11:01.728
Thank you, sir.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.831
Let me give you some things to sing,

11:04.898 --> 11:07.801
because I think you can make
any statement sing amazing.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.069
-All right?
-Uh-oh.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.571
-All right, John, you first.
-OK.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.439
"Do you need a lift, bro?"

11:28.822 --> 11:30.224
All right, Alicia.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.293
"Natural deodorant makes promises
it just can't keep."

11:33.360 --> 11:35.863
I use natural deodorant,
and me and my husband,

11:35.929 --> 11:38.932
we talk about this all the time.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.936
Anytime he asks to borrow my deodorant,
he is so upset at me

11:43.003 --> 11:47.107
at the end of the day.
He's like this natural s*** that you have.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.196
-All right, I was getting into it.
-This is exceptional.

12:09.263 --> 12:10.364
I was getting into it.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.633
John, "if your erection
lasts more than four hours,

12:12.699 --> 12:14.401
you should consult
your doctor immediately."

12:39.359 --> 12:40.894
"It's not appropriate right now."

12:40.961 --> 12:42.863
-That's good.
-Right, guys. This is me.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.998
-I've got to get back to it.
-There you go.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
I've got a figure to keep in shape,
you know?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.702
So, listen, you're the best.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.204
-Stay out of trouble, buddy.
-You're the best.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.371
-I love you, guys.
-So good.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.106
Guess who I'm gonna listen to?

12:53.173 --> 12:54.508
-Alicia Keys.
-Neither of you.

12:54.575 --> 12:56.510
See you later. Bye.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.956
What song should we play next?
I feel like we need new s***.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.826
All right, here we go.
That can't be too low.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.083
That's nice.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.370
Come on!

14:13.187 --> 14:15.088
-Good vibes.
-I like that.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.058
I love this guitar.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.499
Say what?

15:04.037 --> 15:07.040
Everybody's on the street
looking us like we crazy.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.276
-They jamming.
-You know, when you see somebody

15:09.343 --> 15:11.745
in their car and you're like, "Wow".

15:11.812 --> 15:13.413
Like, "I wanna be at that party."

15:32.199 --> 15:33.667
Wait. Who's this?

15:33.734 --> 15:35.969
Oh, it's Taraji!

15:36.069 --> 15:37.104
It's my girl.

15:37.171 --> 15:39.072
-I love me some Taraji.
-You gonna answer it?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.974
I'll just call her back.
That's all-- I'll just--

15:41.074 --> 15:43.076
You're one of those "decline"
kind of friends.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.978
Really?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.280
Really, you ignore my call?

15:46.346 --> 15:47.381
-No.
-Taraji.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.317
Oh, you get with John and act brand new.
I see what's going on.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.086
-I was calling you back.
-When?

15:53.086 --> 15:55.088
Because we were doing these songs.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.091
We'd never forget about you, Taraji.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.397
Don't look. They are all in y'all's face.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.366
Yes, camera and everything. Look.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.635
This is a pretty good
Hollywood Boulevard sighting.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.537
-It really is.
-John Legend and Alicia Keys

16:10.604 --> 16:11.672
-and Taraji Henson.
-Hi!

16:11.738 --> 16:15.309
-Is he hitting his joint? What?
-You know, they crazy out here, right?

16:15.375 --> 16:18.278
-On this one strip. Out their mind.
-It's just nuts.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.415
They're, like, "We just voted to legalise
it. We're gonna smoke anywhere."

16:21.481 --> 16:23.584
And you know what?
Since they passed that,

16:23.650 --> 16:27.054
-I have been smelling weed everywhere.
-Have you?

16:40.801 --> 16:42.736
But when the beat drop...

16:47.741 --> 16:48.742
Did y'all say the word?

16:48.809 --> 16:51.078
-Yes!
-Oh, my God! Bleep!

16:51.745 --> 16:52.513
Here go.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.856
Oh, so, really, y'all let me
do this whole thing

17:35.923 --> 17:39.426
with lipstick on my teeth?
Are you serious?

17:39.493 --> 17:42.196
-It wasn't there the whole time.
-It's probably recent.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.731
Are you sure? I have a leaky eye?
Where's makeup?

17:44.798 --> 17:48.535
Oh, that's right. We're with Alicia Keys.
I shouldn't have worn makeup today.

17:48.602 --> 17:50.470
My bad. My bad.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.073
The problem with fashion and hair,

17:53.140 --> 17:55.309
it always looks bad in retrospect,

17:55.375 --> 17:57.211
'cause you look back
at those old pictures--

17:57.277 --> 17:59.746
-And you're like--
-You're like, "What was I thinking?"

17:59.813 --> 18:02.316
I think that about my whole beginning
of my career.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.851
But at the time I thought it was fresh.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.620
You can rock anything, though.
What about this?

18:07.654 --> 18:08.856
Yes, the "Happy".

18:08.922 --> 18:11.358
-That fits.
-Ah, it's almost there.

18:11.425 --> 18:15.095
-Pharrell hat.
-I got to tell you a story about Pharrell.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.164
I was at this charity event,

18:17.231 --> 18:19.600
and this woman--
she was being so sweet,

18:19.666 --> 18:23.036
and she was like,
"And I'm so happy to meet you."

18:23.036 --> 18:25.539
Oh, no!

18:25.606 --> 18:28.041
Old white women think
I'm Pharrell sometimes.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.410
Really? Well, if you wear that hat,
you a shoo-in.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.145
Don't wear that hat, buddy.

18:34.081 --> 18:35.616
Alicia, I got a question for you.

18:35.682 --> 18:39.319
Do you make up lullabies for your kids?

18:39.386 --> 18:41.755
I definitely-- When they're first born,

18:41.822 --> 18:43.290
I definitely made up all these songs.

18:43.357 --> 18:46.293
And I remember one time, I started
recording them on my voice mails.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.729
I said, "I need to make a lullaby album
'cause this is, like, good."

18:48.795 --> 18:50.063
Mine are terrible.

18:50.097 --> 18:52.533
Yours are terrible?

18:52.599 --> 18:54.568
I'm like,
"I don't need to record any of this."

18:54.635 --> 18:57.571
-No? What's yours like?
-They're like bad commercial jingles.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.474
Yours are like--
When you go to sleep

19:00.541 --> 19:03.710
Luna-- The one I sing the most
is when I'm changing her diaper.

19:03.777 --> 19:05.179
I go...

19:05.245 --> 19:07.881
Somebody's got a stinky booty

19:08.015 --> 19:11.018
Her name is Luna
and she made a poopy

19:11.018 --> 19:12.819
Somebody's got a stinky booty

19:12.886 --> 19:15.522
-That one's good.
-And Daddy's gonna clean it up

19:15.589 --> 19:16.790
Poop, poop

19:16.857 --> 19:18.625
And Daddy's gonna clean it up

19:18.692 --> 19:20.861
I love that.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.030
All right, y'all. It's been real.

19:23.030 --> 19:24.565
-Aw, man.
-Thank you, Taraji.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.233
-I got to go to work.
-You're the most beautiful--

19:26.300 --> 19:27.801
-I'm getting out to give you a hug.
-I love y'all.

19:27.868 --> 19:29.036
A quick sec.

19:35.576 --> 19:38.445
Finally. Let a woman
show you how it's done.

19:38.512 --> 19:40.747
All right. Show me how it's done.

19:40.814 --> 19:43.584
You love playing small shows?
Or you love big shows or--

19:43.650 --> 19:44.685
I like all of them.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.387
The smallest gig I had
was at the Living Room in New York.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.822
Do you know that place?

19:48.889 --> 19:52.292
It's on Lower East Side
and one of the first little gigs I had

19:52.359 --> 19:54.928
was just playing the piano
for five people.

19:55.062 --> 19:59.466
I do love how it feels so intimate,
and it feels so good.

19:59.533 --> 20:03.070
I think we should play, like,
the smallest gig ever.

20:03.136 --> 20:06.073
Like smaller than my five people
at the Living Room gig.

20:06.073 --> 20:09.176
Seriously? But my question is--
I think you got to drop me off at work.

20:09.243 --> 20:11.411
-Let's stop over here real quick.
-Right here?

20:11.478 --> 20:12.679
-Yeah.
-All right.

20:12.746 --> 20:15.449
Left right here.
We're gonna have some fun.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.394
-Smells good.
-I like it.

20:27.461 --> 20:28.929
I like laundry smell.

20:31.098 --> 20:32.799
I think we found our audience of one.

20:32.866 --> 20:33.867
Hi.

20:35.102 --> 20:37.171
This is my friend, Alicia. I'm John.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.539
Nice to meet you.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.210
-Pleasure.
-Hi. Oh, my gosh.

20:43.277 --> 20:45.012
We wanna sing for you.

20:45.112 --> 20:47.581
What the heck is going on?

20:57.891 --> 20:59.560
Oh, my gosh.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.666
You know it.

21:36.830 --> 21:37.931
Oh, shoot.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.182
One more time.

22:12.866 --> 22:15.302
Yeah!

22:15.369 --> 22:17.070
Give me a hug.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.573
Yeah.

22:23.277 --> 22:24.678
That was crazy.

22:24.745 --> 22:26.780
Who organised that choir? That was insane.

22:26.847 --> 22:29.283
Oh, yeah, I always have a choir
on standby, though.
