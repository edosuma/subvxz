00:02.017 --> 00:04.834
[Crow caws]

00:04.835 --> 00:06.014
<i>Frankie: Since the dawn of time,</i>

00:06.015 --> 00:07.893
<i>there has been one truth about men...</i>

00:07.894 --> 00:11.066
<i>if they can toss it, pass
it, dribble it, or throw it,</i>

00:11.067 --> 00:12.090
<i>they will.</i>

00:12.091 --> 00:13.835
- Heads up.
- I'm open.

00:13.836 --> 00:14.987
Frankie: Knock it off, guys.

00:14.988 --> 00:16.291
Stop throwing things in the house.

00:16.292 --> 00:18.267
Why'd you buy fruit if you
don't want us to throw it?

00:18.268 --> 00:19.035
I didn't buy it.

00:19.036 --> 00:20.389
I took it from the Holiday Inn lobby

00:20.390 --> 00:21.411
when I stopped to use the bathroom.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.161
Get open!

00:23.169 --> 00:25.209
Another son right over here!

00:25.210 --> 00:26.874
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.289
Another spudsy check...

00:28.290 --> 00:31.025
going straight into savings
like the rest of them.

00:31.026 --> 00:34.001
Now I know why it's so important
to write down your goals...

00:34.002 --> 00:35.890
because if I didn't have the visual

00:35.891 --> 00:38.650
of the Sue-mometer
tracking my college savings,

00:38.651 --> 00:41.778
I could so easily have blown
this at the pillow pet kiosk.

00:41.779 --> 00:43.625
They have this cross-eyed dolphin

00:43.626 --> 00:45.748
that is the cutest thing you've ever seen.

00:45.749 --> 00:47.409
Mike: Way to stay strong, Sue.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.945
Yeah. Hey, look alive.

00:48.946 --> 00:51.380
Just trying to be a part of the family.

00:51.381 --> 00:54.281
Okay, so, that's $78 spudsy money,

00:54.282 --> 00:56.489
$25 babysitting and... hey!

00:56.490 --> 00:57.322
I found a dime!

00:57.323 --> 01:00.506
No. It's a button. But I needed a button!

01:00.507 --> 01:01.809
The year of Sue, baby!

01:01.810 --> 01:03.625
Oh, I am so proud of you, honey.

01:03.626 --> 01:04.897
And every little bit helps.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.097
Aah!

01:06.098 --> 01:07.529
Mike: Hey!

01:07.530 --> 01:08.673
You almost hit your sister.

01:08.674 --> 01:10.809
Don't worry. I'll get her next time.

01:10.810 --> 01:11.712
Look alive.

01:11.713 --> 01:12.784
Okay. No.

01:12.785 --> 01:15.080
Listen. Cut it out, you guys.

01:15.081 --> 01:16.616
You two are gonna break something.

01:16.617 --> 01:18.953
No more throwing in the kitchen, all right?

01:18.954 --> 01:20.944
You know fruit ball never ends well.

01:26.664 --> 01:28.131
Ahh! Aah!

01:28.132 --> 01:29.921
Ah! Oh, my God!

01:29.922 --> 01:31.373
Frankie: Here! Here!

01:31.374 --> 01:34.597
Get some... get something
big! Get something!

01:34.598 --> 01:35.657
Here! Here! Here! Here! Here! Here!

01:35.658 --> 01:36.979
Aah! Good!

01:36.980 --> 01:37.871
Turn it off!

01:37.872 --> 01:40.771
[Indistinct shouting]

01:40.772 --> 01:42.584
Come on! Somebody get over here!

01:43.647 --> 01:45.368
So, Sue, I called you in

01:45.369 --> 01:46.776
because I was going through your records,

01:46.777 --> 01:48.825
and I found a little "uh-oh!"

01:48.826 --> 01:50.737
"Uh-oh"?

01:50.738 --> 01:52.682
Yeah. Not to worry. It's nothing.

01:52.683 --> 01:54.746
It's just about you not
getting into college.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.195
Uh-oh.

01:56.196 --> 01:56.845
Yeah.

01:56.846 --> 02:00.645
I'm afraid you're short
a P.E. credit to graduate.

02:00.646 --> 02:03.820
But I shouldn't be short.
I did wrestlerettes.

02:03.821 --> 02:06.565
Extracurricular sports
count for one credit.

02:06.566 --> 02:09.491
Oh, that's right. I forgot
you did wrestlerettes.

02:09.493 --> 02:11.692
That would certainly give
you your missing credit...

02:11.693 --> 02:14.087
If it wasn't a pretend sport.

02:14.088 --> 02:16.388
What do you mean, "pretend sport"?

02:16.389 --> 02:18.981
Why does cheerleading
count, but not wrestlerettes?

02:18.982 --> 02:20.749
We do everything they do,

02:20.750 --> 02:22.565
and we do it in homemade uniforms

02:22.566 --> 02:24.141
in front of confused crowds.

02:24.142 --> 02:27.044
Sue, I don't want you to
get stressed out about this.

02:27.045 --> 02:29.909
Every senior gets worried
they're not gonna graduate.

02:32.172 --> 02:33.972
Are you saying I'm not gonna graduate?

02:33.973 --> 02:35.568
Oh, no! [Chuckles]

02:35.569 --> 02:37.715
Not without P.E., no, won't.

02:37.716 --> 02:40.018
But I'm applying to colleges.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.572
There's a Sue-mometer.

02:41.573 --> 02:43.939
I already planned how
I'm gonna thank my parents

02:43.940 --> 02:45.560
on the top of my graduation cap.

02:45.561 --> 02:48.231
Okay, now, don't you worry.
We'll get you all fixed up...

02:48.232 --> 02:49.644
- [Keys clacking]
- ... Unless we can't.

02:49.645 --> 02:51.140
[Chuckles] Okay.

02:51.141 --> 02:53.323
Now, you're a couple months behind,

02:53.324 --> 02:55.803
but we can slip you out of study hall

02:55.804 --> 02:58.340
and slide you right into
coach tink Babbit's P.E. class.

02:58.341 --> 03:00.142
Really? That'll do it?

03:00.143 --> 03:02.510
I'll switch the classes
and I'll get the credit

03:02.511 --> 03:03.854
and everything will be fine?

03:03.855 --> 03:06.230
Yep, not to worry.
Everything will be just fine.

03:07.559 --> 03:08.782
Fingers crossed.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.831
[Guitar playing rock music]

03:13.832 --> 03:15.351
[Music stops]

03:15.352 --> 03:17.655
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't
know you wanted to die.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.903
I'm gonna die anyway, so
you might as well kill me.

03:19.904 --> 03:22.288
I'm intrigued. You can have one minute.

03:23.688 --> 03:25.311
I broke dad's lawn mower.

03:25.312 --> 03:26.970
I'll start writing your funeral song now.

03:26.971 --> 03:28.786
Plug me back in! Look, I came to you

03:28.787 --> 03:29.708
because, of all the family,

03:29.709 --> 03:31.012
you're the most evil and conniving.

03:31.013 --> 03:33.676
Ooh! Flattery! I'll give
you 20 extra seconds.

03:33.677 --> 03:36.525
Wait. Why were you even
near dad's lawn mower?

03:36.526 --> 03:38.332
[Sighs] I was gonna impress Cindy

03:38.333 --> 03:39.506
by driving it past her house.

03:39.507 --> 03:40.751
Pbht. Okay.

03:40.752 --> 03:43.049
There's a lot of issues to
deal with in that statement,

03:43.050 --> 03:45.005
but first let's deal with the lawn mower,

03:45.006 --> 03:46.812
then we'll circle back
to your lack of game.

03:46.813 --> 03:47.353
Go on.

03:47.354 --> 03:48.982
Well, the lawn mower wouldn't start,

03:48.983 --> 03:50.566
so I opened the lid thing,

03:50.567 --> 03:52.373
smacked it with my fist like dad does,

03:52.374 --> 03:54.695
but when I did, I smacked
the key out of my hand

03:54.696 --> 03:55.853
and down into the engine.

03:55.854 --> 03:58.878
I could see it, so I poked around
to see if I could fish it out,

03:58.879 --> 04:01.048
but I think I might have made things worse.

04:06.192 --> 04:07.969
Easy. Just blame the Glossners.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.089
If only.

04:09.090 --> 04:11.753
One of the things I jammed
in there was a bookmark.

04:11.754 --> 04:12.921
Aw, Brick, seriously?

04:12.922 --> 04:15.264
That's like the penguin
leaving his umbrella.

04:15.265 --> 04:17.449
I know. Dad's gonna kill me.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.185
He's already mad about the sink.

04:19.185 --> 04:20.720
Add wrecking his lawn mower to the mix,

04:20.721 --> 04:22.192
and who knows what he's gonna do?

04:22.193 --> 04:24.114
Ooh. Hang on. Hang on.

04:24.115 --> 04:25.210
I think I can help you.

04:25.211 --> 04:27.777
I was saving this one for myself
in case I ever got in trouble,

04:27.778 --> 04:30.824
but, uh, I'm crazy responsible
now, so I'll never need it.

04:30.825 --> 04:32.737
Here's what you're gonna
do. You take dad's wallet.

04:32.738 --> 04:34.532
He'll go nuts looking for
it, think somebody stole it.

04:34.533 --> 04:36.189
Then, when he discovers the lawn mower

04:36.190 --> 04:37.147
and starts to get mad about it,

04:37.148 --> 04:38.671
you run in, say you found his wallet.

04:38.672 --> 04:39.496
You're the big hero.

04:39.497 --> 04:41.180
He can't get mad at you for the lawn mower.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.135
You're welcome.

04:42.136 --> 04:44.255
Now, uh, I'm gonna play you off.

04:44.256 --> 04:45.456
[Sighs]

04:47.489 --> 04:49.033
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:49.034 --> 04:49.932
You're not gonna blow it

04:49.933 --> 04:51.858
with your whole "I'm lying" thing, are you?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.400
Oh, I outgrew that.

04:53.401 --> 04:55.264
Now I just fart when I
lie, but nobody notices.

04:55.265 --> 04:57.441
Mm. That Cindy's a lucky gal.

05:00.089 --> 05:01.933
Well, we've still got a sink.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.068
It's just down there.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.869
The faucet lines and the lines
to the dishwasher are busted.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.573
Ugh, not the dishwasher.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.358
I loved the dishwasher.

05:09.671 --> 05:12.582
[Sighs] It's a huge job, Frankie.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.991
I'm scared to start pulling threads here.

05:14.992 --> 05:16.333
I start taking that counter apart,

05:16.334 --> 05:18.469
and next thing you know,
the garage door won't open.

05:18.470 --> 05:19.485
Okay, hear me out.

05:19.486 --> 05:23.789
It's only a huge job... If we fix it.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.686
What are you talking about?

05:24.687 --> 05:27.078
Listen, if the sink is at all functional,

05:27.079 --> 05:28.511
we don't have to spend the money.

05:28.512 --> 05:31.261
We'll just plug, patch, and
work around what's broken.

05:31.262 --> 05:33.581
Isn't that what we've been
doing for the past 20 years?

05:33.582 --> 05:36.102
We're starting to run out
of things to work around.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.281
This sucks, Frankie.

05:37.282 --> 05:39.791
No matter what kind of Frankie
spin you put on it, it sucks.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.526
No. You know what sucks, Mike?

05:41.527 --> 05:44.638
That poor guy in Muncie who's
just sitting in his recliner

05:44.639 --> 05:47.166
when the ground opens up
and swallows his house.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.624
Okay, yes, there's a hole
where our sink used to be,

05:49.625 --> 05:52.024
but I'd rather have a sink hole in my house

05:52.025 --> 05:53.269
than my house in a sinkhole.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.069
You sure?

05:54.070 --> 05:55.965
I'm kind of jealous he
got to sit in his recliner.

05:55.966 --> 05:58.723
[Door opens, closes]

05:58.724 --> 06:02.811
Well, you will not believe
what happened to me today.

06:02.812 --> 06:04.535
Not if it's something good, we won't.

06:04.536 --> 06:07.963
I met with my college
counselor at lunch today,

06:07.964 --> 06:10.028
and she told me that
wrestlerettes doesn't count

06:10.029 --> 06:13.499
for a P.E. credit because I "made it up."

06:13.500 --> 06:15.220
Well, you did kind of make it up.

06:15.221 --> 06:17.557
Yeah, but everything was
made up at some point...

06:17.558 --> 06:20.790
soccer, rugby, golf.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.879
Golf? What even is that?

06:22.880 --> 06:26.199
Wait. Is she saying this is
gonna delay your graduating?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.829
College or not, let me know.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.365
It'll decide if I use copper
or duct tape down here.

06:30.366 --> 06:32.670
Oh, I am graduating.

06:32.671 --> 06:35.498
I-I will go to P.E. I
will do whatever it takes.

06:35.499 --> 06:37.902
But if they give me any pushback,

06:37.903 --> 06:39.985
I will start throwing some serious

06:39.986 --> 06:41.658
sergeant-at-arms weight around.

06:41.659 --> 06:43.074
<i>Yep.</i>

06:43.075 --> 06:46.510
<i>Sometimes it's good to be the
kid nobody pays attention to.</i>

06:48.418 --> 06:50.822
Everyone thinks gym's an easy "A,"

06:50.823 --> 06:53.662
all you got to do is show
up and put on your shorts.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.001
I mean, you do have to put on your shorts.

06:56.002 --> 06:57.445
It's 10% of your grade.

06:57.446 --> 06:58.550
But if you want an "A,"

06:58.551 --> 07:02.551
you're gonna have to earn it... earn it.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.068
Don't you worry, Coach Babbit.

07:04.069 --> 07:05.594
I will do whatever it takes.

07:05.595 --> 07:07.044
Well, it's gonna take a lot.

07:07.045 --> 07:09.763
We're right in the middle
of our unit on tinikling.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.452
What's tinikling?

07:11.453 --> 07:13.093
Ugh. You're kidding, right?

07:14.880 --> 07:19.132
[Hands and sticks clapping rhythmically]

07:19.133 --> 07:21.381
So long as you're coordinated,
it should be no problem.

07:21.382 --> 07:24.097
Okay, people, let's hustle!

07:24.098 --> 07:27.451
[Clapping continues]

07:33.676 --> 07:35.744
[Water running]

07:40.650 --> 07:43.051
Okay, you can turn it off!

07:43.052 --> 07:44.686
- [Knob squeaks]
- Thanks, Nancy!

07:44.687 --> 07:45.565
Nancy: No problem!

07:45.996 --> 07:47.297
You seen my wallet?

07:47.298 --> 07:49.547
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

07:49.548 --> 07:50.548
I can't find my wallet.

07:50.549 --> 07:53.774
I checked my car, my
desk. I-it's not anywhere.

07:53.775 --> 07:55.722
Are you sure you didn't go on
one of your cleaning binges,

07:55.723 --> 07:57.208
where everything ends
up in a different drawer?

07:57.209 --> 07:58.632
[Chuckling] Oh, you got me.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.164
Place looks amazing, doesn't it?

08:00.165 --> 08:01.229
It's really coming together.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.957
Damn it. All my credit cards
are in there, my license.

08:03.958 --> 08:05.301
I've had that wallet since I was a kid.

08:05.302 --> 08:06.238
I love that wallet.

08:06.239 --> 08:07.719
It's one of the only things I care about.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.958
Oh... I said "one of the only."

08:09.959 --> 08:11.270
Well, where did you have it last?

08:11.271 --> 08:13.125
[Sighs] That is the
world's stupidest question.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.420
If I knew, I'd have it.

08:14.421 --> 08:16.485
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just trying to help.

08:16.486 --> 08:17.964
Well, you're not helping.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.852
This is nuts. I don't lose stuff.

08:19.853 --> 08:21.239
You're the one who loses stuff.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.422
Hey, I don't lose things
any more than anybody else.

08:23.423 --> 08:25.623
Really? Where's the blue bag, Frankie?

08:25.624 --> 08:26.677
It's not lost.

08:26.678 --> 08:28.628
We had it when we were at Disney World.

08:28.629 --> 08:30.516
And it's around here somewhere.

08:30.517 --> 08:33.020
[Birds squawking]

08:33.825 --> 08:36.092
Your keys, the checkbook, your sunglasses,

08:36.094 --> 08:39.096
the remote, the keys, the
snack bag, your keys...

08:39.097 --> 08:41.022
oh, and... don't you say my car.

08:41.023 --> 08:41.868
Did you not lose your car?

08:41.869 --> 08:44.272
Okay, you promised we weren't
gonna bring that up again.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.452
I admitted it was stupid,

08:45.453 --> 08:46.168
- but do we have to...
- I don't even care about that anymore.

08:46.169 --> 08:46.840
- What I care about is my wallet.
- Do you want me to help

08:46.841 --> 08:47.654
you find your wallet?

08:47.655 --> 08:50.435
Whoa. Getting pretty heated in there.

08:50.436 --> 08:51.907
You're not gonna crack, are you?

08:51.908 --> 08:53.156
Are you kidding me?

08:53.157 --> 08:54.795
I've never felt so alive.

08:54.796 --> 08:55.636
Mm.

08:56.836 --> 09:01.749
[Hands and sticks clapping rhythmically]

09:01.750 --> 09:03.302
This is a nightmare.

09:03.303 --> 09:05.509
How does she expect us
to be able to do this?

09:05.510 --> 09:08.268
One week to the final, ladies.

09:08.269 --> 09:12.325
You got to make it through your
entire routine, or you fail.

09:12.326 --> 09:15.215
A snapped ankle is no excuse.

09:15.216 --> 09:17.781
You can't tank tinikling,
not on tink's time.

09:17.782 --> 09:19.570
Heck, get in there!

09:19.571 --> 09:21.226
"Wow" us!

09:21.227 --> 09:28.110
[Clapping continues]

09:28.938 --> 09:30.032
Ugh!

09:32.000 --> 09:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:40.668 --> 09:41.905
Oh!

09:42.540 --> 09:44.142
I thought I told you that's creepy!

09:44.143 --> 09:46.245
Slight snag with the plan.

09:46.246 --> 09:47.973
I seem to have misplaced dad's wallet.

09:47.974 --> 09:49.415
What are you talking about?

09:49.416 --> 09:51.982
Well, I hid it between the
pages of "A Tale of Two Cities,"

09:51.983 --> 09:55.023
but that was too obvious,
so I moved it somewhere.

09:55.024 --> 09:56.257
Long story short,

09:56.258 --> 09:57.609
"A Tale of Two Cities" still holds up,

09:57.610 --> 09:59.456
and I can't seem to find the wallet.

09:59.457 --> 10:00.601
You've lost dad's wallet

10:00.602 --> 10:01.794
and you've read a book
you already read before?

10:01.795 --> 10:03.560
Those are two of the dumbest
things you've ever done, Brick.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.986
Good news, though...

10:04.987 --> 10:07.210
to make up for the wallet,
I stole his car keys.

10:07.211 --> 10:08.201
You did what?!

10:08.202 --> 10:11.005
Oh, I never should have
wasted my plan on you!

10:11.006 --> 10:13.040
I should have given it to
some kid from the Inner City

10:13.041 --> 10:14.873
who could have used it to
make a better life for himself.

10:14.874 --> 10:17.209
Frankie: Guys, get in here!

10:17.210 --> 10:18.114
Breakfast!

10:21.790 --> 10:24.137
I'm losing my mind. Now
I can't find my keys.

10:24.138 --> 10:26.705
Oh, no. Did you check the sink hole?

10:26.706 --> 10:28.519
Really not something
people should have to say.

10:31.643 --> 10:32.590
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:32.591 --> 10:35.215
I told you... not out of
a glass, out of the carton.

10:35.216 --> 10:37.671
My back is killing me
from doing floor dishes.

10:37.672 --> 10:39.525
We're using minimal dishes, people.

10:39.526 --> 10:41.840
No unnecessary dishes!

10:41.841 --> 10:43.277
Breakfast!

10:45.789 --> 10:47.321
Move over. I need to get to school.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.353
No. Hey, no skimming!

10:50.354 --> 10:53.491
Axl's skimming the top so he can
get all the marshmallow charms.

10:53.492 --> 10:54.537
He's gonna get all the luck.

10:54.538 --> 10:56.095
We're drinking from a hose, Brick.

10:56.096 --> 10:57.225
That ship has sailed.

10:57.226 --> 10:58.360
I said move!

10:58.361 --> 11:00.992
I need to get there early so
I can practice my tinikling

11:00.993 --> 11:03.430
so I can pass P.E. so I can get to college

11:03.431 --> 11:05.689
so I can be the generation
that does better than my parents

11:05.690 --> 11:07.820
because apparently my entire future depends

11:07.821 --> 11:10.415
on whether I can jump through
a couple of frickin' sticks!

11:10.416 --> 11:12.060
Ugh. Gah.

11:12.061 --> 11:14.812
Have you ever thought of
asking to be the stick person

11:14.813 --> 11:17.046
instead of the dancing,
tripping, falling person?

11:20.149 --> 11:22.960
[Hands and sticks clapping rhythmically]

11:22.961 --> 11:24.079
Aah! Sorry!

11:25.148 --> 11:26.311
[Gasps]

11:27.058 --> 11:28.830
Ooh. Sorry.

11:30.074 --> 11:32.467
Really, really sorry.

11:43.450 --> 11:45.143
Can I make one small request?

11:45.144 --> 11:46.919
Now that we're washing dishes in the tub,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.104
can we not have spaghetti?

11:48.105 --> 11:49.039
[Sighs]

11:49.040 --> 11:51.232
I told Brick to scrape them first.

11:51.233 --> 11:52.406
What was he, raised in a barn?

11:53.514 --> 11:56.118
Ooh, dad, wait. I need your
help with my P.E. homework.

11:56.119 --> 11:58.035
Can you do the other end
of the sticks with mom?

11:58.036 --> 11:59.852
I'm on my way to mow the lawn.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.399
<i>We can't be the house
with no sink and no yard,</i>

12:02.400 --> 12:04.346
or we're treading into Glossner territory.

12:04.347 --> 12:06.522
Nice try. You haven't
mowed the lawn in a week,

12:06.523 --> 12:07.990
and now all of a sudden, you have to do it?

12:07.991 --> 12:10.359
If I'm tinikling, you're tinikling.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.175
Get down here.

12:12.207 --> 12:14.650
Okay, so, it's twice on the ground,

12:14.651 --> 12:16.192
then once together, then the same again,

12:16.193 --> 12:18.009
then the next time, once on the ground,

12:18.010 --> 12:19.775
then together, then back to twice,

12:19.776 --> 12:20.864
and I dance through it.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.750
- Got it?
- This is P.E. now?

12:22.751 --> 12:24.756
What happened to singling out the weaklings

12:24.757 --> 12:26.100
and nailing them with a ball?

12:26.101 --> 12:27.122
All right, come on.

12:27.123 --> 12:28.831
One, one, two.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.792
One, one, two.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.969
One, one... no, two.

12:32.970 --> 12:35.585
Mike, you got to feel the rhythm.
You're not feeling the rhythm.

12:35.586 --> 12:37.819
Hey, you got me slapping
sticks against the floor.

12:37.820 --> 12:38.595
You get what you get.

12:38.596 --> 12:40.828
Okay, now dad's going faster
because he's getting mad.

12:40.829 --> 12:42.582
I'm not getting mad. Just go, Sue!

12:42.583 --> 12:44.535
Okay, okay, okay. I'm going in.

12:45.648 --> 12:47.125
Ohh. Dah!

12:47.126 --> 12:48.429
Well, it's harder than it looks.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.116
Oh, ho!

12:54.403 --> 12:55.424
Hoo!

12:56.168 --> 12:57.398
Hee!

12:58.200 --> 13:00.260
Stop being good at everything!

13:00.261 --> 13:01.917
Axl: Tell the sun to stop shining!

13:13.679 --> 13:15.094
Axl, dad's about to mow the lawn

13:15.095 --> 13:16.928
and I can't find his wallet or his keys.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.336
Oh, God, why did I ever listen to you?

13:19.337 --> 13:22.095
Hey, stealing dad's wallet,
then returning it to him

13:22.096 --> 13:23.807
to become a hero was a rock-solid plan.

13:23.808 --> 13:25.615
If you can't pull that off, that's on you.

13:25.616 --> 13:26.800
I should never have done this.

13:26.801 --> 13:28.262
I'm not cut out for a life of crime.

13:28.263 --> 13:29.358
I don't have your deviousness.

13:29.359 --> 13:31.606
Or my good looks, but let's
not start naming everything,

13:31.607 --> 13:32.542
or we'll be here all day.

13:32.543 --> 13:34.702
Okay, where did you have them last?

13:34.703 --> 13:37.032
Why do people ask that?
If I knew, I'd have them.

13:40.438 --> 13:42.222
Hey! Dad's wallet!

13:42.223 --> 13:44.077
All this time, I thought it was my wallet.

13:44.078 --> 13:45.653
But wait... I don't have a wallet.

13:45.654 --> 13:47.617
I'd like a wallet, but I
wouldn't keep it in this pocket

13:47.618 --> 13:48.594
'cause I'd forget about it,

13:48.595 --> 13:50.036
so I would put it in this pocket.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.916
Oh! Keys!

13:51.917 --> 13:54.352
Mike: Brick, get in here now!

13:54.353 --> 13:56.284
- Uh-oh.
- [Singsong voice] Show time.

13:56.285 --> 13:59.033
You're on. Now, uh, remember...
whatever happens in there,

13:59.034 --> 14:01.554
you and me... Do not know each other.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.852
Brick, you want to explain

14:07.853 --> 14:10.593
what this was doing in my lawn
mower and why it's not working now?

14:10.594 --> 14:12.598
Looks like somebody who
was told not to touch it...

14:12.599 --> 14:13.456
I found your wallet.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.752
- What? You're kidding?
- Hey!

14:15.753 --> 14:17.841
I've been looking everywhere
for this. Where'd you find it?

14:18.452 --> 14:21.725
By the mailbox... In the grass.

14:21.726 --> 14:23.717
I know everyone else kind of gave up,

14:23.718 --> 14:24.703
but I stuck with it

14:24.704 --> 14:26.606
'cause I knew how important
it was to you, dad.

14:26.607 --> 14:29.198
Huh. It was just laying
there in the grass, huh?

14:29.199 --> 14:32.263
Yes. Yes, it was.

14:32.264 --> 14:35.423
Huh. Well... [Sniffs]

14:36.692 --> 14:38.141
Well, thanks, Brick.

14:38.142 --> 14:39.652
[Sniffs]

14:39.653 --> 14:41.493
I was just about to cancel
all these credit cards.

14:41.494 --> 14:42.504
No problem, dad.

14:42.505 --> 14:44.127
Oh, and I found your keys, too.

14:44.128 --> 14:45.602
Wait. You found my keys, too?

14:45.603 --> 14:47.388
- [Chuckles]
- Yes.

14:47.389 --> 14:48.557
Yes, I did.

14:48.558 --> 14:50.267
[Sniffs]

14:50.268 --> 14:51.427
Where'd you find them?

14:52.531 --> 14:53.308
Well, I...

14:53.309 --> 14:54.298
Axl: Brick, don't answer that!

14:54.299 --> 14:56.538
For the love of God, dad,
stop asking him questions.

14:56.539 --> 14:59.330
I just mean... the point
is you got them back,

14:59.331 --> 15:01.534
so, uh, who cares about
anything else, right?

15:03.105 --> 15:05.221
Hmm. Well, let me check to see
if everything is still here.

15:05.222 --> 15:06.429
Ah!

15:06.430 --> 15:07.872
The credit card that's making payments

15:07.873 --> 15:09.384
on the other two credit
cards... still here.

15:09.385 --> 15:10.501
That's good.

15:11.373 --> 15:12.527
Oh, come on.

15:12.528 --> 15:14.079
This is the picture you have of me?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.663
I look so happy. You got
to get a newer picture.

15:16.664 --> 15:18.181
[Scoffs] Oh, hilarious.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.572
You have a blockbuster card.

15:19.573 --> 15:21.134
Hey, get out of my wallet.

15:21.135 --> 15:23.629
Uh, Mike, why is there a picture

15:23.630 --> 15:25.543
of Jeannie Phillips behind mine?

15:25.544 --> 15:26.486
We used to go out.

15:26.487 --> 15:27.990
Yeah, I know... in high school.

15:27.991 --> 15:29.165
- What?!
- Classic. Let's see!

15:29.166 --> 15:30.521
- Really?
- Come on. Get out of my stuff.

15:30.522 --> 15:33.876
Whoa, dad. Hot. Really
fills out a Jean vest. Hmm?

15:33.877 --> 15:35.774
I can't believe you've had another woman

15:35.775 --> 15:37.710
against your butt cheek
for all these years.

15:37.711 --> 15:41.016
To think... every time I've
taken money out of his wallet,

15:41.017 --> 15:43.679
there was another mom lurking in there.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.015
Look, it doesn't mean anything

15:45.016 --> 15:47.094
other than I'm too lazy
to clean out my wallet.

15:47.095 --> 15:48.935
I'm with you, dad. It's
good to have a backup.

15:48.936 --> 15:50.582
Look, you should take it out, Mike.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.695
That's what people do.

15:51.696 --> 15:53.188
What if you got in an accident

15:53.189 --> 15:54.638
and they're looking through your wallet

15:54.639 --> 15:56.182
and they're like, "which one is his wife?"

15:56.183 --> 15:57.511
"I don't know. Which one is she?"

15:57.512 --> 15:59.137
Who do you want picking
you up from the hospital?

15:59.138 --> 16:00.940
Nobody. Just let me die in peace.

16:00.941 --> 16:02.844
Hey, dad, where's the picture of me?

16:02.845 --> 16:07.493
You got mom, other mom, Axl, Brick,

16:07.494 --> 16:12.036
Axl and Brick, and limestone,
the dead quarry cat?

16:12.037 --> 16:14.594
Huh. Why do you have a
"Reservoir Dogs" ticket stub?

16:14.595 --> 16:17.282
B-because it's... it's
meaningful to me, okay?

16:17.283 --> 16:19.603
I'm below a stub?!

16:19.604 --> 16:22.246
Hey, he has a punch card
to the good ice cream store.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.188
You never let us go to the gelato barn

16:24.189 --> 16:25.562
because you say it's too expensive.

16:25.563 --> 16:28.316
He's one punch away from a
leaning tower of pistachio.

16:28.317 --> 16:31.443
Enough, all of you! Stay out of my stuff.

16:31.444 --> 16:33.673
A man's wallet is private.
Don't mess with that.

16:33.674 --> 16:34.587
That's our will.

16:34.588 --> 16:36.360
[Gasps] This is the death napkin?!

16:36.361 --> 16:37.861
- I don't want to see it.
- I want to see it.

16:37.862 --> 16:39.406
Hey! That's not for you guys.

16:39.407 --> 16:40.820
That napkin's for the lawyers.

16:40.821 --> 16:42.639
Wait. The death napkin's from Chi-Chi's?

16:42.640 --> 16:46.132
Hmm, I expected it from somewhere
with a little more gravitas.

16:46.133 --> 16:47.229
Come on! Let me see!

16:47.230 --> 16:48.273
You guys are gonna kick it soon,

16:48.274 --> 16:50.503
and since I'll be in charge,
I don't want any surprises.

16:50.504 --> 16:52.026
There's no money. Surprise!

16:52.027 --> 16:54.674
Can we just put the scary napkin away?

16:54.675 --> 16:57.090
We are children. We're not
supposed to be seeing this.

16:57.091 --> 16:58.445
I want to see it! I want
to know what I'll get!

16:58.446 --> 17:00.932
Mom said this is not for us.

17:00.933 --> 17:02.811
Mom's not in charge anymore! She's dead!

17:02.812 --> 17:04.291
- Okay.
- Hey. No. Axl.

17:04.292 --> 17:05.561
Hey, knock it off.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.637
[Sighs]

17:10.185 --> 17:11.996
[Milk dripping]

17:11.997 --> 17:13.702
Why is this still here?

17:13.703 --> 17:15.078
Whose job was it to shower

17:15.079 --> 17:16.565
with the big cereal bowl this morning?

17:16.566 --> 17:19.064
No. This is horrible. Now there's no will.

17:19.065 --> 17:20.242
What did it say?

17:20.242 --> 17:22.319
It doesn't really matter
what it said about me.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.117
I imagine it was gonna be revised anyway

17:24.118 --> 17:26.002
to reflect that I'm the
finder of the wallet.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.897
Okay, all of you, take it down a notch.

17:27.898 --> 17:29.341
Your mom and I aren't going anywhere.

17:29.342 --> 17:31.836
Unfortunately, we have
longevity on both sides.

17:31.837 --> 17:34.814
But what if, you guys? What if?

17:34.815 --> 17:36.577
You have to make another will.

17:36.578 --> 17:38.133
Without a will, there will be nothing

17:38.134 --> 17:39.489
but fighting and accusations,

17:39.490 --> 17:40.996
and eventually, the three of us

17:40.997 --> 17:42.168
will stop speaking to each other.

17:42.169 --> 17:44.651
And years will go by,
a-a-and our children

17:44.652 --> 17:45.691
won't even know their cousins.

17:45.692 --> 17:47.248
And we'll spend holidays apart.

17:47.249 --> 17:48.898
I'll be with my husband and children,

17:48.899 --> 17:51.530
and Axl will be across
town with his family,

17:51.531 --> 17:53.618
each wondering if the other
is having a merry Christmas,

17:53.619 --> 17:55.360
but each too proud to pick up the phone.

17:55.361 --> 17:57.348
And Brick, who refuses to choose sides,

17:57.349 --> 17:59.339
will be eating Christmas
dinner all by himself

17:59.340 --> 18:00.374
at a Perkins Restaurant,

18:00.375 --> 18:02.742
being served by a waitress
who feels sorry for him.

18:02.743 --> 18:04.454
You have to make a will,

18:04.455 --> 18:06.061
a specific, detailed,
who-gets-what,

18:06.062 --> 18:07.177
or it'll tear us apart.

18:07.178 --> 18:09.223
I've seen it before. Look
at Casey Kasem's family.

18:09.224 --> 18:12.031
Wait. Why am I the one
being pitied by a waitress?

18:12.032 --> 18:13.521
She's the one working on Christmas.

18:13.522 --> 18:16.439
My God, can we start this
not-talking thing now?

18:16.440 --> 18:17.947
You see how he treats us?

18:17.948 --> 18:20.043
Can you imagine if he gets to decide

18:20.044 --> 18:22.011
if I get aunt opal's purple cow creamer

18:22.012 --> 18:23.932
that you already promised me?

18:23.933 --> 18:25.520
Sue, that thing broke years ago.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.455
You say it broke, but did you see it break?

18:27.456 --> 18:30.316
Or is Axl looting from the estate already?

18:30.317 --> 18:33.118
Doesn't matter. What matters
is I found dad's wallet.

18:33.119 --> 18:35.067
Oh, no. I see what you're doing.

18:35.068 --> 18:36.883
You're trying to get on dad's good side

18:36.884 --> 18:38.297
so you'll get more of the inheritance.

18:38.298 --> 18:40.325
Well, maybe he'd be interested to know

18:40.326 --> 18:41.392
he didn't lose his wallet

18:41.393 --> 18:42.991
'cause you took it in the first place!

18:45.298 --> 18:46.224
Is that true?

18:46.225 --> 18:48.103
- No.
- Don't lie.

18:48.104 --> 18:49.429
Don't you dare lie right now!

18:49.430 --> 18:51.192
- It was Axl's idea!
- Ah!

18:51.193 --> 18:53.087
- He masterminded the whole thing!
- I have ideas, yes. Did I act on them? No!

18:53.088 --> 18:54.909
My brain does not think that way!

18:54.910 --> 18:56.657
- He's the one who did it!
- All right, you want a will?

18:56.658 --> 18:58.978
Fine. You got it. We'll make a will.

18:58.979 --> 19:05.617
"The last will and testament
of Michael and Frances Heck."

19:06.416 --> 19:08.655
So, what do you guys want?

19:10.734 --> 19:12.198
[Sighs]

19:18.678 --> 19:21.149
- I'm good.
- Nothing I want.

19:21.150 --> 19:23.281
I can't think of anything
off the top of my head.

19:24.078 --> 19:25.541
<i>Well, I guess that's the good thing</i>

19:25.542 --> 19:27.276

19:27.277 --> 19:28.550
<i>there's no fighting...</i>

19:29.280 --> 19:31.543
<i>Not like that Casey Kasem's family.</i>

19:31.544 --> 19:33.849

19:33.850 --> 19:35.321

19:35.322 --> 19:37.445
<i>and people who do their
dishes in the shower?</i>

19:37.446 --> 19:40.026
<i>Sure. There's room for improvement.</i>

19:40.027 --> 19:43.178
<i>But maybe we are leaving
our kids something good...</i>

19:43.179 --> 19:45.817
<i>the ability to pull
together in tough times.</i>

19:45.818 --> 19:49.130
<i>And that's something you
can't put on a napkin.</i>

19:52.932 --> 19:55.322
Okay, Heck, you're up!

19:55.323 --> 19:56.241
And remember...

19:56.242 --> 19:59.242
your routine had better
be mastered... mastered.

19:59.243 --> 20:00.377
And when I say "mastered,"

20:00.378 --> 20:03.660
I mean you better bring it... bring it.
