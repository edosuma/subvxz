To earn the Botany badge,
we need to identify and collect samples

of ten local plants.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.556
Here are your itineraries.

-Bye, Mum. We're heading to the park.
-Oh, I almost forgot.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.050

01:42.227 --> 01:44.813
I chose this area for maximum efficiency.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.398
All the plants we need
should be within this half acre.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.027
I found crab grass... and crab grass.
[gasps]

01:51.111 --> 01:52.737
And crab grass!

01:52.821 --> 01:54.572

new experiences, adventures.

Or...

02:15.009 --> 02:16.177

on earning the badge.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.548
If we find a blue nettle,

02:53.631 --> 02:57.510

Oh, yes. Most elf legends are.
[chuckles]

06:48.241 --> 06:51.828

<i>And the Bragga family,</i>

06:56.624 --> 06:59.502
<i>This was one of the oldest</i>
<i>and most valuable plots of land</i>

06:59.585 --> 07:01.003
<i>in all of elf-dom.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:02.839
<i>The revisions were fierce.</i>

<i>Clauses were included,</i>
<i>terms were terminated.</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:09.345
<i>The amendments alone took an entire day.</i>

07:12.181 --> 07:16.185
<i>Finally, many drafts later,</i>
<i>it was finished.</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:19.313
<i>A masterwork of mutual obligation.</i>

07:19.897 --> 07:25.069
<i>Both families signed in triplicate</i>
<i>and took it to the king for his approval.</i>

07:27.321 --> 07:29.323
<i>Then disaster struck.</i>

07:29.824 --> 07:34.996

<i>had only signed twice!</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:43.713
You don't understand!

07:43.796 --> 07:45.173
<i>In those ancient days,</i>

07:45.256 --> 07:48.551
<i>it was treason to bring</i>
<i>an unfinished contract before the king.</i>

07:49.135 --> 07:51.429
<i>He exiled the Bragga family on the spot.</i>

07:51.512 --> 07:56.017
<i>With the contract technically unfinished,</i>
<i>the king declared the plot...</i>

[Elf King] <i>No Elf's Land!</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:04.192

<i>neither bought nor sold, to this very day.</i>

08:04.775 --> 08:06.694
The laws are much fairer now,
of course. [chuckles]

08:06.777 --> 08:09.614
If a Bragga signs this contract,
their exile will be over.

08:09.697 --> 08:13.117
But, unfortunately, nobody's been able
to find them for generations.

-All you need to do is sign this contract.
-[Bartell] No!

08:57.995 --> 09:02.625
After being exiled,
our family swore off paperwork forever.

09:02.708 --> 09:08.047

not even a receipt.

Of offers, of acceptance, of, of terms?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.100
Well, it's simple.

09:19.183 --> 09:24.063
We keep our word.
And when we don't, we enter combat!

09:56.554 --> 09:57.680
[all shouting]

09:59.098 --> 10:02.226
Alfur, your family
tried to buy No Elf's Land?

10:02.310 --> 10:07.148
They did, and thereby
are responsible for our exile.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.151
Well, that's hardly a fair interpretation.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.446
You must suffer for your family's crimes.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.364
There must be combat!

10:15.448 --> 10:16.532
[elves shouting]

10:18.534 --> 10:23.414
You will not leave this land until you
take on all ten of our rabbit warriors,

how to ride a rabbit.

-Hi, Agnes.
-[Hilda] Don't worry, Alfur.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.346
Nobody takes our friend without a fight.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.764
Bring it on, you bunnies.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.433
Hold on!
Everybody calm down.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.853
Contracts always have loopholes.
There must be another solution.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.647
Give us a day.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.900
Let us see if we can find a solution
that makes everybody happy.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.526
Hmm...

10:53.069 --> 10:55.154
Your offer is acceptable.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.990
Also, if we succeed,
we want the blue nettle.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.533
Just, just a clipping.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.453
Fine.

11:02.536 --> 11:06.957
But we're holding on to the boy
to make sure you all come back.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.501
That's all right with me.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.213
I imagine it will be safer
than whatever you end up getting into.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.548
I'll just stay here
with the invisible ant men.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.717
We are not ant men!

11:16.801 --> 11:19.428
Um, if you want,
I could make you visible to him.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.348
-It just takes a bit of paperwork.
-[all] No!

11:22.431 --> 11:24.558
[laughs nervously] Never mind.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.858
[mouthing words]

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
You elves are thorough, aren't you?

11:35.027 --> 11:36.112
Mm.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.407
What are you all doing?
I thought you were out looking for plants.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.324
We were.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.577
But now it seems we're reviewing
a miniature contract for loopholes.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.745
Ah, I see.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.831
Oh! How about this?

11:46.914 --> 11:51.502
"An elf contract is null and void
if destroyed by the fire of a lindworm."

11:51.585 --> 11:53.421
So we need to find a lindworm.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.589
-Now that's an adventure!
-Mm-mm.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.717
They put that clause in every contract.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.052
It doesn't actually mean anything.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.973
Lindworms are very rare
and very paperwork averse.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.810
-Heh, it's like saying, "When cows fly."
-You mean pigs.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.271
Oh, no. That happens
with some regularity.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.189
Do we have any better ideas?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.443
So, where do we start looking
for a lindworm?

12:20.740 --> 12:24.243
I kind of hoped we'd be setting out
into a deep, dark forest.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.747
The library
is a forest for the imagination.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.332
And research,
the greatest adventure of them all.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.917
[gasps] I like him.

12:32.626 --> 12:33.919
Found it!

12:34.003 --> 12:37.965
<i>Lindworms: Habitats and Hideouts,</i>
volume 27, section 3.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.804
I love a good subject-based
classification system. [chuckles]

12:45.890 --> 12:48.893
"Lindworms are notoriously
antisocial creatures

12:48.976 --> 12:51.687
and most fled
during the construction of the city.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.816
At last report, only one lair remained
in all of Trolberg."

12:55.900 --> 12:57.568
Well, where is it?

12:57.651 --> 13:02.740
[Frida] According to the key,
the lair should be right here.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.869
-The lindworm lives under water?
-Uh, well, not exactly.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.460
[Hilda] We could swim it.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.797
[Alfur] Wait. I may have a solution.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.798
[grunts]

13:19.423 --> 13:22.468
-I need a conch shell and a tide chart.
-[Frida] Here.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.762
There's one in the <i>Sparrow Scout's Guide.</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:27.848
All right, let's see.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.934
High tide at dusk. Very good!

Sorry. Tiny lungs. [chuckles]

[Hilda] It's a water spirit!

14:07.346 --> 14:10.558
We were hoping you could give us a ride
to that island out there.

include disturbed foliage,

This is perfect.
We don't even have to wake it up.

16:39.456 --> 16:42.793
We can just hold the contract
in front of its nose and, poof,

16:43.293 --> 16:44.670
problem solved.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.880
Do you really think this is a good idea?

16:46.964 --> 16:49.133
It feels a tad dangerous.

goes in for.

18:43.413 --> 18:47.417

18:47.501 --> 18:48.544
So do we.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.130
In fact, we spent the entire morning

18:51.213 --> 18:54.967

some unique, very exciting samples.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.718

19:28.041 --> 19:31.170
Would you part
with these exquisite specimens?

I'd be more than willing
to burn your contract in return.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.092
And not devour us?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.595
Oh... I suppose.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.430
Can we get that in writing?

It's to keep the bugs out.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.637
You know, David is quite the young man.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.681
He has set the bar very high
for future hostages.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.350
Now, let me guess.

20:26.433 --> 20:31.355
You have failed to break the contract
and have returned for combat!

No! Very much the opposite.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.348
Well, uh, we were so angry
about being exiled,

21:06.431 --> 21:09.726
we never thought about
actually leaving this place.

-But what about No Elf's Land?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.024
I don't know.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.110
Do you still want it?

21:18.694 --> 21:22.030
Really? You'd cede
your ownership rights just like that?

21:22.114 --> 21:24.241
No contract, no lease, no anything?

21:24.741 --> 21:28.954
Well, we have our own way
of sealing deals.

all new samples tomorrow.

and almost eaten by a dragon?
