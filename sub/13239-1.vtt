22:29.185 --> 22:30.384
WOULD NOT TAKE A DIME.

22:30.487 --> 22:31.786
AM I LIKE THE LUCKIEST
PERSON ALIVE?

22:31.888 --> 22:32.753
[laughs]

22:32.856 --> 22:34.622
- HEY.

22:36.158 --> 22:38.726

22:38.828 --> 22:40.127
MINGLE!

22:40.229 --> 22:42.029
OKAY.

22:42.131 --> 22:43.764
OH...TOO BAD.

22:43.867 --> 22:45.299
I'M SORRY.

22:47.203 --> 22:50.371
WISH IT LUCK.
WISH IT LUCK.

22:50.473 --> 22:51.973
NO. NO.

22:52.074 --> 22:53.975
SORRY.

23:01.384 --> 23:03.183
WHAT IS THIS,
NATIONAL PIE DAY?

23:03.285 --> 23:05.786
WHO TOLD THESE PEOPLE
TO BRING PIES?

23:15.765 --> 23:17.498
- OH!

23:17.600 --> 23:19.366
OH, MAYBE NEXT TIME

23:27.309 --> 23:29.911
BEN...BEN MAR-MARTIN.

23:30.013 --> 23:31.478

23:31.581 --> 23:33.080
THE GUY WHO WORE
MY MARGARITA.

23:33.182 --> 23:34.448
YES!
I WORE YOUR MARGARITA.

23:34.551 --> 23:36.651
- YES.

23:36.753 --> 23:38.953
I BROUGHT YOU A PIE.

23:39.055 --> 23:40.555
SOMEBODY TOOK IT.

23:40.657 --> 23:41.756
WOW.

23:41.858 --> 23:43.057
THAT'S THE SECOND PIE
TONIGHT,

23:43.159 --> 23:46.827
BUT HEY,
WHO DOESN'T LIKE PIE, RIGHT?

23:46.930 --> 23:49.664
YEAH. YEAH.

23:51.634 --> 23:53.801
SO THIS IS A BIT, UH...

23:53.903 --> 23:56.403
LESS INTIMATE
THAN I EXPECTED.

23:56.505 --> 23:58.238
OH, WELL, IT'S
A LOCK AND KEY PARTY,

23:58.340 --> 24:00.307
- SO THE MORE THE MERRIER.
- AH, IT'S A LOCK AND-- OH!

24:00.409 --> 24:02.910
OF COURSE
IT'S A LOCK AND KEY PARTY.

24:03.012 --> 24:04.211
UH-HUH. YEAH.

24:04.313 --> 24:05.512

24:16.759 --> 24:18.059
EXCUSE ME.

24:23.866 --> 24:26.000
HAVE YOU EVER...
BEEN TO ONE OF THESE?

24:26.102 --> 24:28.302
NO. CAN'T SAY
I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE.

24:28.404 --> 24:30.304
- YOU?
- I ACTUALLY WENT TO

24:30.406 --> 24:32.172
A COLLEGE MIXER
FOR HALLOWEEN ONE YEAR

24:32.274 --> 24:34.709
WHERE YOU HAD TO DRESS UP AS
YOUR FAVORITE KITCHEN UTENSIL.

24:34.811 --> 24:36.611
[laughing]
I DON'T REALLY GUESS

24:36.713 --> 24:38.278
THAT COUNTS, THOUGH,
DOES IT?

24:38.380 --> 24:41.082
HI. I'M BEN.
[glasses clink]

24:41.183 --> 24:43.017
AND I HAVE LOOKED STUPID
PLENTY OF TIMES.

24:43.119 --> 24:44.318
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

24:44.420 --> 24:46.253
I PROBABLY LOOK
PRETTY STUPID RIGHT NOW.

24:46.355 --> 24:49.490
I'M CHARLEY,
AND IF ANYBODY LOOKS STUPID RIGHT NOW,

24:49.592 --> 24:50.958
IT'S PROBABLY ME.

24:51.060 --> 24:53.861
I BROUGHT A PIE.

24:56.032 --> 24:59.466
I BROUGHT A PIE!
I'M NOT KIDDING!

24:59.568 --> 25:00.567
I BROUGHT A PIE HERE
TONIGHT!

25:00.670 --> 25:02.670
- REALLY?
- YES!

25:02.772 --> 25:05.773
WOW. AND YOU DON'T
LOOK STUPID AT ALL.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.541
QUITE THE CONTRARY,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

25:07.644 --> 25:08.609
YOU LOOK...VERY NICE.

25:08.711 --> 25:10.177
THANK YOU.

25:10.279 --> 25:12.412
OOPS.
SORRY, SORRY.

25:12.515 --> 25:14.882
BUT YOU ARE
CLEARLY VERY DRUNK.

25:14.984 --> 25:16.651
[chuckling]
NO, I'M...

25:16.753 --> 25:18.252
IF I WAS DRUNK, TRUST ME,

25:18.354 --> 25:20.554
I WOULD BE STANDING ON A
TABLE HUMILIATING MYSELF

25:20.657 --> 25:22.657
SINGING SOME OLD,
UNRECOGNIZABLE SONG

25:22.759 --> 25:23.824
AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS.

25:23.926 --> 25:26.661
- LIKE WHAT?
- I WOULD PROBABLY

25:26.763 --> 25:30.131
BE SINGING <i> YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY YOU LOVE ME</i> BY DUSTY--

25:30.232 --> 25:31.899
DUSTY SPRINGFIELD.
I LOVE DUSTY.

25:32.001 --> 25:33.834
SERIOUSLY, THAT-- THAT--
THAT'S CRAZY.

25:33.936 --> 25:37.004
IN MY OPINION,
<i>DUSTY IN MEMPHIS</i>

25:37.106 --> 25:39.239
- IS PROBABLY THE--
- THE BEST RECORD EVER MADE.

25:39.341 --> 25:40.340
YES!

25:40.442 --> 25:41.608
[clink]
YES!

25:41.711 --> 25:43.778
SO ARE-- ARE YOU
FRIENDS WITH CHLOE?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.479
UH, YEAH.
WE WORK TOGETHER.

25:45.581 --> 25:46.881
- OH.
- YOU?

25:46.983 --> 25:49.516
UH, WELL...
IF I'M BEING HONEST,

25:49.618 --> 25:52.586
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT TONIGHT
WAS GONNA BE OUR FIRST DATE.

25:52.689 --> 25:55.422
I THINK TONIGHT
IS SUPPOSED TO BE

25:55.524 --> 25:58.893
- A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FIRST DATE.
- NO, A PROPER DATE.

25:58.995 --> 26:01.095
WITH A BEGINNING,
A MIDDLE, AND AN END.

26:01.197 --> 26:02.930
WELL, THE NIGHT IS YOUNG.

26:03.032 --> 26:05.465
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU MIGHT STILL GET AN END.

26:05.568 --> 26:06.734
- HEY, YOU TWO.
- HEY!

26:06.836 --> 26:08.335
HAVING FUN?

26:08.437 --> 26:11.271
YEAH. WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT DUSTY SPRINGFIELD.

26:11.373 --> 26:13.774
OH! OH, IS THAT
A NEW AIR FRESHENER?

26:16.212 --> 26:17.344
- NO...
- NO.

26:17.446 --> 26:18.946
ARE YOU-- ARE YOU HAVING
FUN?

26:19.048 --> 26:20.748
- OH, I ALWAYS HAVE FUN.
- YEAH.

26:20.850 --> 26:22.950
EVEN THOUGH NO ONE'S KEY'S
OPENED MY LOCK YET.

26:23.052 --> 26:25.920
- WANNA TRY IT?
- YES, I WILL...

26:26.022 --> 26:27.888
GIVE THAT A SHOT...

26:27.990 --> 26:29.757
AND SEE...

26:29.859 --> 26:30.858
YEAH...NO.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.259
IT'S JUST-- HANG ON.

26:32.361 --> 26:33.660
- NO.
- NO.

26:33.763 --> 26:34.995
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK.

26:35.098 --> 26:36.797
YEP. NO.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.433
HAVE YOU TWO TRIED?

26:39.535 --> 26:41.235
- NO.
- NO, WE HAVEN'T, ACTUALLY.

26:41.337 --> 26:42.903
- WE DIDN'T--
- COME ON.

26:43.005 --> 26:44.271
DON'T BE-- DON'T BE SHY.

26:44.373 --> 26:47.174
- OKAY.
- WANNA...GIVE IT A SHOT?

26:47.276 --> 26:48.508
LET'S SEE.

26:48.611 --> 26:50.111
AND...

26:50.213 --> 26:51.178

26:51.280 --> 26:52.813
- IT FITS!

26:52.915 --> 26:55.149
WHOO! EVERYONE, WE HAVE
OUR FIRST FITTING COUPLE!

26:55.251 --> 26:56.884
HA HA!
PICTURE TIME.

26:56.986 --> 26:58.953
- OKAY.

26:59.055 --> 27:01.155

27:01.257 --> 27:04.125

27:04.227 --> 27:05.860
BIGGER SMILES, YOU TWO!

27:05.962 --> 27:07.628
OKAY.

27:07.730 --> 27:09.463
EXCELLENT.

27:09.565 --> 27:11.165
ABBY WILL EMAIL IT
TO YOU BOTH.

27:11.267 --> 27:12.532
- OKAY.
- JUST MAKE SURE I GET

27:12.635 --> 27:13.901
YOUR EMAIL ADDRESSES

27:14.003 --> 27:15.970
- WILL DO.
- OKAY, GANG.

27:16.072 --> 27:18.538
LET'S SEE WHO ELSE
IS MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.

27:20.643 --> 27:23.911
- OKAY. SO WHAT NOW?
- PIE?

27:24.013 --> 27:25.345
WE SHOULD HAVE PIE,
SHOULDN'T WE?

27:25.447 --> 27:26.713
NO ONE'S GONNA EAT OUR PIE.

27:26.816 --> 27:29.150
WE SHOULD AT LEAST
HAVE A SLICE, RIGHT?

27:29.252 --> 27:32.153
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
I'M GONNA...TAKE OFF.

27:32.255 --> 27:36.757
BUT YOU SHOULD STICK AROUND
AND GET TO KNOW CHLOE.

27:36.859 --> 27:39.626
WELL, IN THAT CASE, CHARLEY,
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

27:39.728 --> 27:42.729

BUT IT WA-- IT WAS NICE.

27:42.832 --> 27:45.766

A GOOD GUY, BEN.

27:45.868 --> 27:49.203
SO, UM...HERE.

27:49.305 --> 27:51.371
STAY THAT WAY.

27:51.473 --> 27:52.773
THANK YOU.

28:02.656 --> 28:05.023
HEY, YOU.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.958
- DID YOU HAVE FUN?
- WE PLAYED <i> GUITAR HERO</i>

28:07.060 --> 28:08.593
AND HAD THREE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF PIZZAS.

28:08.695 --> 28:09.895
WOW.

28:09.997 --> 28:11.362
- HEY, GUYS.

28:11.464 --> 28:14.232
- THANKS FOR THE ASSIST, VAL.

28:14.334 --> 28:16.601
ANYTHING TO GET YOUR LOVE
LIFE OUT OF NEUTRAL.

28:16.703 --> 28:18.937
- MM.
- SO HOW WAS THE LITTLE SOIREE?

28:19.039 --> 28:20.872
NOT SO LITTLE.

28:20.974 --> 28:22.440
IT WAS A SINGLES PARTY

28:22.542 --> 28:24.575
FOR 300 OF CHLOE'S
CLOSEST FRIENDS.

28:24.678 --> 28:27.279
- OH! HA HA!
- SO BASICALLY, IT WAS TORTURE.

28:27.380 --> 28:30.215
THOUGH THERE WAS
THIS LOCK AND KEY THEME,

28:30.317 --> 28:33.351
WHICH I GUESS
WAS AN OKAY ICEBREAKER.

28:33.453 --> 28:36.288
ANYBODY OKAY
BREAK YOUR ICE?

28:36.389 --> 28:39.224
NO, NOT REALLY.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.527
CHARLEY...

28:42.629 --> 28:45.897
WELL, THERE WAS

28:45.999 --> 28:48.666
BUT HE'S ALL GAGA

28:53.040 --> 28:54.806
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS

29:40.487 --> 29:44.655
BIG PARTY.

29:46.559 --> 29:48.493

30:05.012 --> 30:06.378
WELL, I'LL TAKE THAT

30:06.479 --> 30:09.014
WHATEVER. YOU KNOW MEN.
THEY NEVER CALL...

30:09.116 --> 30:10.315
JUST EMAIL.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.384
MAYBE...

30:12.485 --> 30:14.920
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.757
[telephone rings]

30:19.859 --> 30:21.526
GAME 1.

30:21.628 --> 30:23.328

30:28.902 --> 30:30.435
[laughs]
HEY.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.603
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU
WERE CHLOE'S ASSISTANT.

30:32.705 --> 30:35.106
I'M NOT.
I'M JUST COVERING HER PHONE.

30:38.178 --> 30:39.744
[ahem] IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT,

30:39.846 --> 30:42.414
I'M JUST GONNA PRY MY FOOT
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

30:42.515 --> 30:44.249
SURE. GO RIGHT AHEAD.

30:47.654 --> 30:49.454
OKAY. I'M BACK.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.992
SO WHAT DID I MISS
AFTER I LEFT THE PARTY?

30:54.094 --> 30:56.828
JUST MORE
OF MY WITTY REPARTEE.

30:56.930 --> 30:58.363
ANY DRUNKEN SINGING?

30:58.465 --> 31:01.399
UNFORTUNATELY NOT.
I SWITCHED TO 7UP MIDSTREAM.

31:01.501 --> 31:05.736
SEE? AND I WAS SURE YOU'D
END UP TAKING REQUESTS.

31:05.839 --> 31:08.739
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU LEFT, HUH?

31:08.842 --> 31:11.176
UH...WELL, I'LL TELL CHLOE

YEAH, MEN, THEY SAY THEY'LL CALL,

31:33.400 --> 31:35.066
CHARLEY.

31:38.238 --> 31:39.871
CHARLEY, SIT DOWN.

31:39.973 --> 31:42.073

31:42.175 --> 31:44.609
I'VE BEEN OFFERED A JOB

32:26.619 --> 32:29.820
I'M GONNA TALK TO JIM

32:29.923 --> 32:31.789

32:35.795 --> 32:37.895

- I'M ON A NO-CARB KICK.

INTO A SIZE 2.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.740
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT.

37:54.842 --> 37:56.442
- YOU'RE PERFECT.
- [chuckles]

37:56.544 --> 37:59.178
WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK
YOU KNOW ABOUT ME?

37:59.280 --> 38:01.547
I SEE A CHLOE WHO'S
BRIGHT...

38:01.649 --> 38:03.182
UM, AMBITIOUS.

38:03.284 --> 38:04.684
VERY CAPABLE.

38:04.785 --> 38:07.353
BUT MOST LIKELY HAS HAD
SOME DOORS OPEN TO HER

38:07.455 --> 38:09.922
BECAUSE SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

38:10.024 --> 38:11.290
GO ON.

38:11.392 --> 38:12.925
I SEE A CHLOE

38:13.027 --> 38:14.960
THAT, DESPITE HER BEAUTY,

38:15.062 --> 38:16.229
GOOD FORTUNE,
AND NUMEROUS FRIENDS,

38:16.331 --> 38:18.797
AT THE END OF THE DAY...

38:18.899 --> 38:21.267
AT THE END OF THE DAY
JUST WANTS ONE THING,

38:21.369 --> 38:23.502
AND THAT'S...TRUE LOVE.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.938
BUT THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE

38:26.040 --> 38:28.708
IS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO
FIND THAN SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

38:28.809 --> 38:31.477
BECAUSE MOST GUYS,
ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT GUYS,

38:31.579 --> 38:33.613
FIND HER TOO UNAPPROACHABLE,

38:33.715 --> 38:35.814
TOO OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE,
SO MUCH SO

38:35.916 --> 38:37.750
THAT I BET
THEY DON'T EVEN TRY.

38:39.687 --> 38:43.289
SO...SHE HAS DECIDED
TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

38:43.391 --> 38:46.024
AND...
GIVE ROMANCE A TRY.

38:46.127 --> 38:50.062
SEE IF IT LEADS SOMEWHERE
NEW AND FULFILLING.

38:52.032 --> 38:54.900
- WAS I CLOSE?
- PRETTY GOOD.

38:55.002 --> 38:57.903
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

39:01.409 --> 39:02.742
IT'S WEIRD.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.677
IT'S LIKE...BEN KNOWS ME.

39:04.779 --> 39:06.612
LIKE HE'S LOOKED INTO
MY SOUL OR SOMETHING.

39:06.714 --> 39:08.481
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A SENSITIVE GUY.

39:08.583 --> 39:10.115
YEAH. FOR THE FIRST TIME,

39:10.217 --> 39:12.685
I FEEL LIKE I'VE MET A GUY
WHO LIKES ME FOR...

39:12.787 --> 39:14.052
WHAT'S IN HERE.

39:14.155 --> 39:15.954
YEAH, WELL,
SENSITIVE GUY OR NO,

39:16.056 --> 39:19.024
WHAT'S OUT HERE IS WHAT'S
DRIVING THAT BOY'S TRAIN.

39:19.126 --> 39:21.394
I DON'T KNOW, VAL.
THIS ONE MAY BE DIFFERENT.

39:27.368 --> 39:29.067
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

39:29.170 --> 39:32.037
HAVEN'T HEARD YOU MENTION
PHANTOM OF THE EMAIL RECENTLY.

39:32.139 --> 39:34.873
THAT'S BECAUSE HE...
STOPPED EMAILING.

39:34.975 --> 39:37.677
MAYBE HE'S BUSY.
OR OUT OF TOWN?

39:37.779 --> 39:39.244

TO EMAIL HIM,

39:52.627 --> 39:54.493
AND I HAVE A CHILD
TO THINK ABOUT.

STRANGE MEN INTO HIS LIFE.

39:57.532 --> 39:59.164
THAT HASN'T EXACTLY
BEEN A PROBLEM.

OH, NO, DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
SHE'S GOT THE GOODS.

43:25.172 --> 43:26.438
OKAY, CHLOE, I'M NEXT.

43:26.541 --> 43:28.607
YOU KNOW WHAT?

43:28.709 --> 43:30.776
OPERATION CHARLEY GOES
DATING STARTS IMMEDIATELY.

43:30.878 --> 43:32.912
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TOMORROW NIGHT?

43:37.184 --> 43:38.784
MOM, YOU LOOK PRETTY.

43:38.886 --> 43:40.753
I'M GLAD YOU DID A DO-OVER.

43:40.855 --> 43:42.154
[laughs]
IT'S A MAKEOVER.

43:42.256 --> 43:43.522
AND THANK YOU, HONEY.

43:43.624 --> 43:45.591
YOU KNOW WHAT?

43:45.693 --> 43:47.593
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
KIND OF PRETTY.

43:47.695 --> 43:49.528
ARE YOU GONNA
BRING ME HOME A NEW DAD?

43:49.630 --> 43:51.163
I'M GOIN' ON A DATE,

43:51.265 --> 43:52.531
NOT A SHOPPING SPREE.

43:52.633 --> 43:55.434
HMM. THAT'S TOO BAD.

43:55.536 --> 43:57.036
HEY.

43:57.137 --> 43:58.804
YOU KNOW WHAT?

43:58.906 --> 44:01.239
ONE DAY,
YOU MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER DAD.

44:01.341 --> 44:04.710
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

44:04.812 --> 44:07.446
IS THAT I LOVE YOU
VERY, VERY MUCH, OKAY?

44:07.548 --> 44:08.547
I KNOW, MOM.

44:08.649 --> 44:09.848
AND THIS TIME,

44:09.951 --> 44:11.650
NO TYING UP THE BABYSITTER.

44:11.752 --> 44:13.485
- OKAY.
- SHE'S OLD.

44:13.588 --> 44:15.320
CHARLEY, THIS IS GABE.

44:15.422 --> 44:16.589
HI, GABE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

44:16.691 --> 44:18.457
HEY. CHLOE'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

44:18.559 --> 44:19.692
BUT I SHOWED UP ANYWAY.

44:19.794 --> 44:22.027
[both laughing]

44:22.129 --> 44:23.963
CHARLEY,
GABE'S GOT A WICKED SENSE OF HUMOR.

44:24.065 --> 44:25.097
HEY, EVERYBODY.

44:25.199 --> 44:27.866
I AM SO SORRY THAT I AM
LATE.

44:27.969 --> 44:29.735
HI.

44:29.837 --> 44:31.369
CHARLEY, YOU LOOK...

44:31.472 --> 44:32.605
AMAZING.

44:32.707 --> 44:34.339
CHLOE SAID THAT YOU HAD
A MAKEOVER--

44:34.441 --> 44:35.641
- UM-- [ahem]
- EXAM.

44:36.644 --> 44:38.944
AT WORK.
SO...

44:39.046 --> 44:40.646
- HEY, I'M BEN.
- GABE.

44:40.748 --> 44:42.615
NICE TO MEET YOU.

44:42.717 --> 44:45.784
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE WAY
YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT MY DATE.

44:47.989 --> 44:50.089
WOULD YOU RATHER
I LOOK AT YOU THAT WAY?

44:50.190 --> 44:51.957
AH...

44:52.059 --> 44:53.325
[laughter]

44:53.427 --> 44:55.794
I LOVE THIS GUY.
GIVE IT HERE.

44:57.197 --> 44:58.163
WHO'S HUNGRY?

44:58.265 --> 45:00.099
I AM.

45:02.069 --> 45:04.202
SEE, I NEVER GOT THE HANG
OF TWIRLING SPAGHETTI.

45:04.304 --> 45:05.904
- HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?
- HMM...

45:06.007 --> 45:08.907
<i>MOMENTO.</i>
LET ME SHOW YOU THE MANNER

45:09.010 --> 45:10.509
FROM SICILY...

45:10.611 --> 45:11.810
HOW TO-A TWIRL THE
SPAGHETTI.

45:11.912 --> 45:13.311
FIRST YOU TAKE-A THE FORK
AND...

45:13.413 --> 45:16.181
AND YOU MAKE THE SWIRL
LIKE THIS.

45:16.283 --> 45:19.251
AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE PASTA
ON-A THE FORK

45:19.353 --> 45:21.286
AND AFTER THE TWIST
AND SWIRL...

45:21.388 --> 45:23.555
THEN YOU EAT!

45:25.526 --> 45:27.526
BRAVO.

45:27.628 --> 45:30.595
GABE, CHARLEY HAS THE MOST
ADORABLE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SON.

45:30.698 --> 45:32.931
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S HE DO FOR A LIVING?

45:33.034 --> 45:35.134
[chuckles]

45:35.235 --> 45:37.102
WELL...

45:37.204 --> 45:39.571
ACTUALLY,
LUKE, IN HIS MIND,

45:39.674 --> 45:41.439
PLAYS FOR THE DODGERS,

45:41.542 --> 45:43.942
BUT IN REALITY,
HE'S JUST LEARNING HOW TO THROW A BALL.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.944
NOT THAT I AM THE BEST
TEACHER, 'CAUSE I'M NOT.

45:46.047 --> 45:48.681
WELL, I'D OFFER TO HELP,
BUT I MAKE KIDS CRY.

45:48.783 --> 45:49.648
MOST ADULTS TOO.

45:49.750 --> 45:51.684
[laughs]

45:51.786 --> 45:54.920
CHARLEY, I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY
TO TEACH LUKE IF YOU'D LIKE.

45:55.022 --> 45:56.388
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO THAT.

45:56.490 --> 45:57.956
NO. IT'S OKAY.

45:58.059 --> 46:01.026
YOU'RE KIDDING.

46:01.128 --> 46:02.661
- NO.
- REALLY?

46:02.763 --> 46:04.529
UM, WELL...

46:04.631 --> 46:08.266
WELL, IF IT'S OKAY, I'M...
I'M SURE HE'D LOVE IT.

46:08.368 --> 46:09.501
IT'S A DATE THEN.

46:09.603 --> 46:10.969
WHAT A GUY!

46:11.072 --> 46:13.205
OKAY, SO BEN'S A PRINCE.
WE GET IT.

46:13.307 --> 46:14.639
- NOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT ME?
- MM...

46:14.742 --> 46:16.709
YES. OF COURSE.

46:16.811 --> 46:18.143
GABE, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

46:18.245 --> 46:20.579
ME? I RUN A CHARM SCHOOL.

46:20.681 --> 46:22.047
KIDDING.

46:22.149 --> 46:25.084
[laughter]

46:27.088 --> 46:28.854
AH, YEAH,
I'LL TAKE THE BREAD.

46:35.029 --> 46:37.696
TONIGHT WASN'T SO BAD,
WAS IT?

46:37.798 --> 46:41.767
NO. I'M NOT SURE GABE IS THE
RIGHT MATCH FOR CHARLEY,

46:41.869 --> 46:43.135
- BUT...
- OH.

46:43.237 --> 46:45.204
THAT WAS THE BEST I COULD DO
ON SHORT NOTICE.

46:45.305 --> 46:47.706
ANYWAY, YOU GOTTA KISS
A BUNCH OF FROGS

46:47.808 --> 46:51.977
BEFORE YOU MEET YOUR PRINCE.

46:52.079 --> 46:53.879
BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE IN
TRUE LOVE, RIGHT?

46:53.981 --> 46:56.348
I BELIEVE IN TRUE LUCK.

46:56.450 --> 46:59.618
AT LEAST, THAT'S HOW LIFE'S
WORKED FOR ME, ANYWAY.

46:59.720 --> 47:01.086
THE OTHER NIGHT AT DINNER
YOU SAID

47:01.188 --> 47:02.888
YOU ONLY WANTED ONE THING.

47:02.990 --> 47:04.823
YOU SAID THAT WAS TRUE LOVE.

47:04.925 --> 47:06.759
NO. YOU SAID IT FOR ME.

47:06.861 --> 47:08.727
BESIDES, JUST BECAUSE
I MAY WANT IT

47:08.829 --> 47:11.730
DOESN'T MEAN I BELIEVE
IT ACTUALLY EXISTS.

47:15.669 --> 47:18.570
THAT'S NOT VERY ROMANTIC
OF YOU.

47:18.672 --> 47:21.173
NO.

47:21.275 --> 47:23.541
BUT THIS IS.

47:31.418 --> 47:34.219
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

47:42.758 --> 47:45.826
SO CHARLEY'S DATING
RANDOM JERKS.

47:45.928 --> 47:47.060
MAYBE I SHOULD BE
DATING HER.

47:47.162 --> 47:48.995
[laughs]

47:49.097 --> 47:51.798
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

47:51.900 --> 47:53.333
CHARLEY'S A GOOD GIRL,
YOU KNOW?

47:53.435 --> 47:55.335
SHE'S NICE, SWEET, KIND.

47:55.437 --> 47:58.404
SHE'S PRACTICALLY
A PERFECT WOMAN.

47:58.507 --> 47:59.606
LAST THING
SHE NEEDS TO BE DOING

47:59.708 --> 48:01.140
IS DATING A CYNIC LIKE YOU.

48:01.242 --> 48:02.809
OFF THE BOARD.

48:02.911 --> 48:04.277
UNBELIEVABLE.

48:04.379 --> 48:06.312
WELL, MAYBE, UH...
SHE SHOULD BE DATIN'

48:06.414 --> 48:07.614
SOMEONE LIKE, UM...

48:07.716 --> 48:08.882
I DON'T KNOW, YOURSELF?

48:08.984 --> 48:10.484
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

48:10.586 --> 48:12.552
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE
AWFULLY FOND OF A LADY

48:12.654 --> 48:14.287
THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN
ACTUALLY DATING.

48:14.389 --> 48:16.756
I CAN HAVE A GIRLFRIEND AND
A FRIEND AT THE SAME TIME.

48:16.859 --> 48:18.692
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
IT'S CALLED MULTITASKING.

48:18.794 --> 48:20.259
- COME ON.
- IT'S CALLED BEING SOFT.

48:20.362 --> 48:21.928
BUT ANYWAY,
HOW IS THE LOVELY CHLOE DOING?

48:22.030 --> 48:25.398
SHE'S, UM...

48:25.501 --> 48:27.133
SHE'S JUST RIDICULOUSLY HOT.

48:27.235 --> 48:28.835
YOU KNOW?
THAT'S HOW SHE IS.

48:28.937 --> 48:31.771
I JUST THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
A PROBLEM SHARING IN PERSON.

48:31.874 --> 48:33.439
YOU KNOW?

48:33.542 --> 48:35.241
WHAT NOW?

48:35.343 --> 48:37.010
AH...HO HO HO HO HO!

48:37.112 --> 48:39.345
IT'S JUST LAST NIGHT

48:39.447 --> 48:41.314
SHE HAD A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT TAKE ON TRUE LOVE

48:41.416 --> 48:43.149
THAN WHEN WE SPOKE ONLINE--
IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

48:43.251 --> 48:44.784
IT'S JUST...
IT'S JUST CONFUSING TO ME.

48:44.887 --> 48:47.020
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY IT
ONLINE.

48:47.122 --> 48:49.155
IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO SAY IT TO HER FACE.

48:49.257 --> 48:51.491
FADE AWAY!

48:51.593 --> 48:54.995
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

49:01.970 --> 49:04.470
[crunching]

49:04.573 --> 49:07.841
[TV murmurs quietly]

49:38.674 --> 49:41.107
[chuckling quietly]

49:53.188 --> 49:55.188
WE STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
SEARCHING FOR UFOs,

49:55.290 --> 49:57.523
WHICH WAS KIND OF FUN
FOR THE FIRST HOUR,

49:57.626 --> 49:59.059
THEN BECAME POINTLESS.

50:00.629 --> 50:02.161
OH, BEN MADE A FIRE
WITH TWIGS.

50:02.263 --> 50:04.530
HE'S SUCH A BOY SCOUT.

50:04.633 --> 50:06.399
WE TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS.

50:06.501 --> 50:09.202
THOUGH I MADE BEN
EAT MY MARSHMALLOWS,

50:09.304 --> 50:10.804
'CAUSE I'M TOTALLY
OFF SUGAR NOW.

50:10.906 --> 50:12.205
OH, MY FAVORITE PART.

50:12.307 --> 50:14.941
WE STOPPED AT THE OUTLETS
ON THE WAY BACK.

50:15.043 --> 50:17.010
[telephone rings]

50:19.081 --> 50:21.180
BEN. HEY.
ARE YOUR EARS BURNING?

50:21.282 --> 50:22.916
LUKE KEEPS ASKING ME

50:23.018 --> 50:24.651
WHEN HE'S GONNA TEACH HIM
HOW TO THROW A HARD BALL.

50:24.753 --> 50:25.885
DID YOU GET THAT?

50:28.356 --> 50:29.623
OKAY, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

50:29.725 --> 50:32.425
FIRE IT RIGHT DOWN THE TUBE.

50:33.629 --> 50:34.995
WHOA! OKAY.

50:35.097 --> 50:36.162
THAT WASN'T BAD.

50:36.264 --> 50:37.631
THAT WAS TOTALLY BAD.

50:37.733 --> 50:40.466
- I THROW LIKE MY MOTHER.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

50:40.568 --> 50:43.269
YOU THROW MUCH BETTER THAN HER.
I'VE SEEN HER THROW.

50:43.371 --> 50:45.471
YOUR SKILLS
FAR SURPASS HERS.

50:45.573 --> 50:47.741
OKAY. I'LL BE WAITING
ON THE BENCH.

50:47.843 --> 50:48.875
- OKAY.
- WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

50:48.977 --> 50:50.309
I COULD EVEN
THROW THAT WELL.

50:50.411 --> 50:52.311
TRUE STORY.
BUT I PRACTICED AND I PRACTICED,

50:52.413 --> 50:55.081
AND A COUPLE YEARS LATER,
I WAS BRINGING THE HEAT.

50:55.183 --> 50:56.449
OR AT LEAST SOME WARMTH
BY THEN.

50:56.551 --> 50:58.551
SO COME HERE.
CHECK THIS OUT.

50:58.654 --> 51:01.121
- THE PEACE SIGN, RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

51:01.222 --> 51:03.389
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THE BALL
RIGHT BETWEEN TWO FINGERS.

51:03.491 --> 51:04.858
YOU'RE GONNA REST IT
ON THAT KNUCKLE,

51:04.960 --> 51:06.259
CLAMP IT WITH YOUR THUMB,
JUST RIGHT HERE.

51:06.361 --> 51:08.528
THE SAME ARM
THAT YOU THROW WITH,

51:08.630 --> 51:10.496
YOU'RE GONNA PUSH OFF
THAT LEG.

51:10.598 --> 51:12.265
JUST POINT TO WHERE
YOU WANNA THROW.

51:12.367 --> 51:15.135
AND WATCH.
STRAIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD HERE...

51:15.236 --> 51:16.936
RIGHT THERE.

51:17.039 --> 51:18.404
GIVE IT A SHOT.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

51:22.678 --> 51:24.978
OKAY, WATCH THIS, MOM!
[snaps]

51:25.080 --> 51:26.646
WATCH THIS!

51:26.748 --> 51:28.447
WATCH THIS.

51:28.550 --> 51:29.582
I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

51:29.685 --> 51:30.550
RIGHT DOWN THE PIPE.

51:30.652 --> 51:32.351
OH!
HO HO HO HO OH!

51:32.453 --> 51:33.687
ONE LESSON!

51:33.789 --> 51:36.122
I'M THE PHIL JACKSON
OF PEE WEE BALL!

51:36.224 --> 51:39.159
AGAIN!

51:39.260 --> 51:42.062
RIGHT DOWN THE PIPE.
YES!

51:46.301 --> 51:48.902
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

51:49.004 --> 51:50.170
ARE YOU KIDDING?

51:50.271 --> 51:53.073
I HAD A BLAST OUT THERE.

51:53.175 --> 51:55.308
LUKE IS A GREAT KID.

51:55.410 --> 51:59.012
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A GREAT MOM.

51:59.114 --> 52:01.915
I DON'T WANNA BE INTRUSIVE,
BUT, UM...

52:02.017 --> 52:03.950
WHERE'S HIS DAD?

52:05.887 --> 52:07.787
UM...

52:07.889 --> 52:10.356
HE LEFT, UH...

52:10.458 --> 52:13.793
HE LEFT RIGHT AFTER
LUKE HAD HIS FIRST BIRTHDAY.

52:16.497 --> 52:18.264
SO, UH...

52:18.366 --> 52:20.299
SO HE'S NOT IN LUKE'S LIFE
AT ALL?

52:20.401 --> 52:22.401
MM-MM.

52:22.503 --> 52:24.537
HIS LOSS.

52:26.141 --> 52:27.306
AND LUKE'S, OF COURSE.

52:29.244 --> 52:31.477
WELL, IT'S GOOD
YOU'RE DATING AGAIN.

52:31.579 --> 52:33.613
RIGHT?

52:35.683 --> 52:38.885
YEAH, RIGHT NOW I'M KINDA
STALLED IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

52:41.656 --> 52:44.124
- GET OUTTA HERE!
- MM-HMM.

52:44.226 --> 52:46.025
YOU'RE A GREAT CATCH.

52:48.329 --> 52:52.232
YOU DESERVE A GREAT GUY.

52:52.333 --> 52:53.900
HE'S OUT THERE.

52:54.002 --> 52:55.769
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND HIM.

52:57.806 --> 53:00.306
NICE, DUDE, NICE!

53:04.279 --> 53:05.945
- SURPRISE.
- OH...BEN.

53:06.047 --> 53:07.580
YOU SCARED THE LIFE
OUT OF ME!

53:07.682 --> 53:09.115
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

53:09.217 --> 53:11.717
I'M HERE FOR
CHARLEY'S THANK-YOU LUNCH.

53:11.820 --> 53:13.853
OH...I FORGOT.

53:13.955 --> 53:17.590
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, GUYS,
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

53:17.692 --> 53:18.958
I'LL PROBABLY
JUST ORDER IN.

53:19.060 --> 53:21.727
BUT YOU TWO GO.
ENJOY YOURSELVES.

53:23.731 --> 53:25.298
ARE YOU SURE?

53:25.400 --> 53:27.400
YEAH, YEAH, GO.

53:27.502 --> 53:29.602
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

53:29.704 --> 53:31.370
WE'RE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

53:31.472 --> 53:33.506
- ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY.

53:33.608 --> 53:35.008
- ALL RIGHT. BYE.
- BYE. SEE YOU LATER.

53:35.110 --> 53:36.109
BYE.

53:37.846 --> 53:42.615
OKAY, SO WHAT IS YOUR
ALL-TIME FAVORITE SAD MOVIE?

53:42.717 --> 53:44.383
SAD MOVIE...

53:44.485 --> 53:46.052
<i>THE NOTEBOOK.</i>

53:46.154 --> 53:47.620
BECAUSE I LOVED GENA
ROWLANDS IN IT.

53:47.722 --> 53:49.655
SHE WAS STELLAR IN THAT.
I WILL GIVE YOU THAT.

53:49.757 --> 53:51.157
WHAT ABOUT COMEDY?

53:51.259 --> 53:52.826
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
COMEDY OF ALL TIME?

53:52.928 --> 53:54.593
OKAY, WELL, YOU CAN'T...
JUDGE ME.

53:54.696 --> 53:56.395
I HAVE TO HEAR IT FIRST.

53:56.497 --> 53:58.231
<i>16 CANDLES.</i>

53:58.333 --> 54:01.067
WHO DOESN'T LIKE <i> 16 CANDLES?</i>
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

54:01.169 --> 54:03.903
WHAT ABOUT DESSERT?
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE DESSERT?

54:04.005 --> 54:07.673
PIE, OF COURSE.

54:07.775 --> 54:08.875
THINK WE TALKED ABOUT
THAT ONE.

54:08.977 --> 54:12.912
- WE CERTAINLY DID.
- MM-HMM.

54:13.014 --> 54:15.748
WHAT ABOUT...

54:15.851 --> 54:18.684
YOUR FAVORITE
CHILDHOOD MEMORY?

54:18.786 --> 54:20.519
MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD
MEMORY?

54:20.621 --> 54:23.890
- HMM?
- MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD MEMORY.

54:23.992 --> 54:26.192
THAT'S BIG.
UM...

54:26.294 --> 54:28.627
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE...

54:28.730 --> 54:31.464
RIDING BIKES
WITH MY DAD AT THE BEACH

54:31.566 --> 54:35.835
REALLY EARLY IN THE MORNING,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

54:35.937 --> 54:38.404
ALL RIGHT.
MY TURN.

54:38.506 --> 54:40.073
- GO.
- OKAY.

54:40.175 --> 54:41.741
- FAVORITE COLOR.
- BLUE.

54:41.843 --> 54:43.309
- FAVORITE BAND.
- BEATLES.

54:43.411 --> 54:45.378
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.847
[laughs] YOU SAY THAT
LIKE YOU'RE SURPRISED.

54:47.949 --> 54:50.950
WHAT IS THAT-- IS THAT
TOO OLD-SCHOOL FOR YOU?

54:51.052 --> 54:53.219
NO, I JUST FIGURED YOU
FOR A STONES FAN.

54:53.321 --> 54:54.954
WELL, I AM A STONES FAN,

54:55.056 --> 54:56.622
BUT IF I HAD TO PICK ONE,
DESERT ISLAND STYLE,

54:56.724 --> 54:58.024
I WOULD GO WITH BEATLES.

54:58.126 --> 54:59.259
[laughing]

55:01.696 --> 55:02.828
INTERESTING.

55:02.931 --> 55:04.931
SO IS THE NEW AND IMPROVED
CHARLEY

55:05.033 --> 55:06.532
GETTING A LITTLE COZY
WITH YOUR MAN?

55:06.634 --> 55:09.402
WHAT? NO.
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS.

55:09.504 --> 55:11.704
HE DID HER A FAVOR,
SO SHE'S JUST RETURNING IT.

55:11.806 --> 55:13.373
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU'RE FREE FOR LUNCH?

55:13.474 --> 55:14.607
CHECK THIS OUT.

55:14.709 --> 55:17.310
I'M BUYING.

55:17.412 --> 55:19.178
BE READY IN FIVE.

55:19.281 --> 55:21.547
UM...

55:23.151 --> 55:25.051
MM...

55:25.153 --> 55:28.154
FAVORITE MOMENT
IN THE LAST...

55:28.256 --> 55:29.822
THREE MONTHS.

55:29.925 --> 55:33.059
THAT WOULD BE CHLOE'S
LOCK AND KEY PARTY.

55:35.030 --> 55:37.931
I MET A NEW FRIEND
THAT NIGHT.

55:38.033 --> 55:40.699
- BURGER AND FRIES?
- YES.

55:40.802 --> 55:42.168
YES, MA'AM.

55:42.270 --> 55:44.070
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

55:44.172 --> 55:46.105
THANKS.

55:46.207 --> 55:47.340
- [chuckling]
- WHAT?

55:47.442 --> 55:48.908
I'M JUST THINKING--

55:49.010 --> 55:51.077
THE ONLY THING ON THAT PLATE
THAT CHLOE WOULD EAT

55:51.179 --> 55:52.578
IS THE PICKLE.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.713
AND I'M NOT EVEN CERTAIN
ABOUT THE PICKLE.

55:54.816 --> 55:56.349
[laughs] OKAY, WELL...

55:56.451 --> 55:59.452
IF IT'S NOT MOVING OR SOME
UNIDENTIFIABLE COLOR,

55:59.554 --> 56:00.786
I'M THERE.

56:00.888 --> 56:03.957
A WOMAN AFTER MY OWN
HEART.

56:05.393 --> 56:06.792
MMM!

56:06.894 --> 56:08.394
THANK YOU FOR BOOSTING
LUKE'S CONFIDENCE.

56:08.496 --> 56:09.628
ALTHOUGH,
YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.

56:09.730 --> 56:11.431
WITH ALL YOUR TALK,

56:11.532 --> 56:13.466
HE'S GONNA END UP WANTING
TO CALL YOU FOR A PLAYDATE.

56:13.568 --> 56:16.135
THAT'S OKAY.
WE CAN MOVE ON TO BASKETBALL--

56:16.237 --> 56:17.337
HEY, GUYS.

56:17.439 --> 56:20.039
WE WERE JUST OUT
FOR A QUICK LUNCH.

56:23.311 --> 56:26.212
I THOUGHT, UH,
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A LOT OF STUFF TO DO.

56:26.314 --> 56:28.914
- WELL, IT WAS--
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

56:29.017 --> 56:31.985
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES
CHLOE NO FUN FOR THE BENJI.

56:32.087 --> 56:33.719
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT, NOW,
CAN WE?

56:33.821 --> 56:35.754
YEAH. [chuckles]
I GUESS...

56:35.857 --> 56:37.290
I GUESS WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

56:37.392 --> 56:38.791
WELL, BYE, CHARLEY, CHLOE.

56:38.893 --> 56:41.594
- SEE YOU SOON, RYAN.
- BEN.

56:41.696 --> 56:42.561
BYE, BEN.

56:42.663 --> 56:44.063
AFTER YOU, LADIES.

56:50.290 --> 56:52.557
I WANNA KNOW WHAT DRIVES YOU,
WHAT MAKES YOU TICK.

56:52.659 --> 56:55.527
WHAT THRILLS YOU,
WHAT-- WHAT-- WHAT YOU VALUE,

56:55.629 --> 56:57.028
FROM THE SIMPLEST THINGS
TO THE DEEPEST.

56:57.130 --> 56:58.830
I DO.

56:58.932 --> 57:02.500
AND MAYBE THAT'S...MORE THAN
YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME.

57:03.804 --> 57:06.771
NOW, THAT'S NOT TRUE
AT ALL.

57:06.873 --> 57:08.940
I'M VERY INTERESTED IN YOU.

57:09.042 --> 57:11.108
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

57:12.813 --> 57:15.046
- WHAT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR?
- WHAT?

57:15.148 --> 57:17.615
WHAT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR?

57:19.653 --> 57:21.118
- RED.
- IT'S BLUE.

57:21.220 --> 57:23.287
ACTUALLY.

57:23.389 --> 57:25.423
WHAT'S MY FAVORITE BAND?

57:25.525 --> 57:29.260
- BEN FOLDS.
- BEN...[laughs] FOLDS. NO.

57:29.362 --> 57:31.529
WHAT POSITION DID I PLAY
IN LITTLE LEAGUE?

57:31.631 --> 57:32.931
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
- BECAUSE I PLAYED RIGHT FIELD.

57:33.032 --> 57:34.732
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

57:34.835 --> 57:36.434
THIS ISN'T BECAUSE I WENT OUT
TO LUNCH WITH RYAN, IS IT?

57:36.536 --> 57:37.969
- IT'S NOT.
- BECAUSE RYAN'S NOBODY.

57:38.071 --> 57:39.737
WE JUST WORK TOGETHER.

57:39.840 --> 57:42.340
IT'S NOT ABOUT RYAN.

57:42.442 --> 57:44.676
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY.
I AM.

57:50.817 --> 57:52.216
I KNOW.
LET'S WATCH A DVD.

57:52.318 --> 57:54.385
CLEAR OUR HEADS.

57:54.488 --> 57:57.956
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FUN MOVIE?
MAYBE WE HAVE IT HERE.

58:01.928 --> 58:03.962
WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
<i>16 CANDLES?</i>

58:04.063 --> 58:05.830
I'LL GO CHECK.

58:25.084 --> 58:26.985
[sighs]

58:33.159 --> 58:34.792
THE TOP FIVE REASONS

58:34.895 --> 58:37.261
I'M A TOTAL LOSER.

58:45.705 --> 58:47.739
REMEMBER ME?

58:49.809 --> 58:51.743
DON'T DO THIS, CHARLEY.

58:59.686 --> 59:00.752
[electronic tone]

59:03.723 --> 59:04.956
THIS BETTER BE GOOD...

59:05.058 --> 59:08.526
FOR A WEEKEND 8:00 A.M.
WAKEUP CALL.

59:08.628 --> 59:09.961
OKAY.

59:10.063 --> 59:12.329
GUESS WHO ARTBOY GOT AN
EMAIL FROM LAST NIGHT.

59:12.432 --> 59:14.465
ANGELINA JOLIE.
SHE WANTS TO HAVE YOUR KID.

59:14.568 --> 59:16.901
- C ANDERSON.
- CHLOE EMAILED YOU?

59:17.003 --> 59:18.369
THAT'S YOUR BIG SUNDAY
EMERGENCY?

59:18.471 --> 59:21.539
I NEVER GAVE HER
THE ARTBOY EMAIL ADDRESS.

59:21.641 --> 59:23.107
- FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
- WHATEVER.

59:23.209 --> 59:25.209
- WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW.

59:25.311 --> 59:27.779
IF SHE ENDED IT
WITH CYBER ME

59:27.881 --> 59:29.180
BECAUSE SHE WAS INTO
REAL ME...

59:29.282 --> 59:31.382
SHE'S CHEATING ON YOU.

59:31.484 --> 59:33.051
WITH YOU.

59:33.152 --> 59:34.619
[laughs]
THAT'S CLASSIC!

59:34.721 --> 59:36.020
OKAY, THAT'S NOT--
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

59:36.122 --> 59:37.855
- IT'S KINDA FUNNY.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

59:37.958 --> 59:39.924
OKAY. WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

59:40.026 --> 59:41.759
WE GOT INTO A LITTLE FIGHT,
BUT IT WAS TINY.

59:41.861 --> 59:44.629
I MEAN, IT WAS...
INCONSEQUENTIAL, YOU KNOW?

59:44.731 --> 59:46.130
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
A DEAL BREAKER,

59:46.232 --> 59:48.199
- I WOULDN'T THINK.
- MAYBE NOT TO YOU.

59:48.301 --> 59:51.035
ARTBOY HAS TO MEET
C ANDERSON.

59:51.137 --> 59:52.269
IN THE FLESH.

59:52.371 --> 59:54.238
AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT
RIGHT NOW,

59:54.340 --> 59:56.074
NIP IT IN THE BUD BEFORE
IT GETS TOO COMPLICATED

59:56.175 --> 59:57.909
AND YOU LOSE HER ENTIRELY.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.478
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

01:00:04.951 --> 01:00:07.151
[whimpers]

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.061
[thinking]
C. GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

01:00:22.268 --> 01:00:26.270
IT'S TIME FOR US TO MEET...
IN PERSON.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:29.340
PLEASE SAY YES.
[electronic whoosh]

01:00:29.442 --> 01:00:31.408
[electronic tone]

01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:46.958
OKAY. LET'S DO IT.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.360
HOW'S TOMORROW, 1:00 P.M.,

01:00:49.462 --> 01:00:52.797
THE TABLES AT THE SKYLIGHT
MARKET PLACE?

01:00:59.773 --> 01:01:01.039
[electronic tone]

01:01:03.943 --> 01:01:05.309
THEY CAN'T BLAME ME,
YOU KNOW,

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:06.944
- IF THEY DON'T GET THE WORK DONE.
- YEAH, I KNOW!

01:01:07.047 --> 01:01:09.113
SO YOU GUYS REALLY
DON'T THINK I'M CRAZY?

01:01:09.215 --> 01:01:11.949
CHARLEY, YOU'RE MEETING HIM
IN A CROWDED PUBLIC PLACE,

01:01:12.052 --> 01:01:13.785
OUTDOORS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

01:01:13.887 --> 01:01:15.419
- YOU'LL BE FINE.
- HOWEVER...

01:01:15.521 --> 01:01:19.123
IF HE LOOKS REMOTELY LIKE
HANNIBAL LECTOR, SKEDADDLE.

01:01:19.225 --> 01:01:21.559
YOU KNOW, IT'S WILD
THAT AFTER ALL THOSE EMAILS,

01:01:21.661 --> 01:01:23.194
YOU STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

01:01:23.296 --> 01:01:24.729
YEAH, WELL, HE DIDN'T
WANT TO SEND A PHOTO,

01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:27.364
AND, FRANKLY,
NEITHER DID I.

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:29.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT THE HECK?

01:01:29.235 --> 01:01:30.134
I'LL GO.

01:01:30.236 --> 01:01:31.535
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

01:01:31.637 --> 01:01:33.738
I WANNA SEE THIS GUY.

01:01:34.974 --> 01:01:37.608
OKAY.

01:01:40.379 --> 01:01:42.747
OKAY, SO WHAT'S YOUR
MENTAL PICTURE?

01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:46.250
- UM...OKAY, TALLISH...
- MM-HMM.

01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:48.452
MAYBE A LITTLE SCRUFFY.

01:01:48.554 --> 01:01:50.221
KIND EYES.

01:01:50.323 --> 01:01:51.956
SOULFUL LOOKING.

01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:53.891
YEAH. SOULFUL.

01:01:53.993 --> 01:01:55.626
OH, AND, UM, A CUTE BUTT.

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:57.195
WELL, YEAH.

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.197
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:01.332
IF ARTBOY'S HALF AS GREAT
AS YOU SAY HE SEEMS,

01:02:01.434 --> 01:02:03.034
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.569
OH! WHAT IF HE'S HERE NOW?

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:07.271
I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE MY BODYGUARD.

01:02:07.373 --> 01:02:08.940
OKAY, I GOT IT.

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:11.109
I'LL JUST CASUALLY GO OVER
THERE AND WINDOW-SHOP.

01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:13.544
AND THEN I'LL CASUALLY SIT
A FEW TABLES AWAY,

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:15.213
AND IF IT'S A BUST,
SNEEZE TWICE.

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:17.615
I'LL JUST CALL YOUR CELL PHONE
WITH A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

01:02:17.717 --> 01:02:19.617
OKAY. I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN SIXTH GRADE.

01:02:19.719 --> 01:02:22.820
OOH! I LOVED THE SIXTH
GRADE.

01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:26.423
BYE, CHARLEY.
I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE OFFICE.

01:02:47.613 --> 01:02:51.215
- IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS.

01:02:51.317 --> 01:02:53.417
PERFECT.
THANKS.

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.588
WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS GUY, RIGHT?

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.823
HEY, MAN.

01:03:07.934 --> 01:03:10.434
C ANDERSON?

01:03:10.536 --> 01:03:12.403
BEN! IT'S YOU!

01:03:12.505 --> 01:03:15.506
YES...

01:03:15.608 --> 01:03:18.309
C ANDERSON...

01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:20.377
IT IS ME, BEN.

01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:31.155
WHAT BROUGHT THAT ON?

01:03:31.257 --> 01:03:34.625
JUST...THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL
OF OUR EXPERIENCES ONLINE.

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:36.560
I JUST-- I JUST--

01:03:36.662 --> 01:03:38.696
FEEL LIKE
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

01:03:38.798 --> 01:03:42.200
THAT I KISSED THE REAL...
C ANDERSON.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.737
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
BE AT THE TABLES.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.840
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:03:48.942 --> 01:03:51.108
YEAH, IT'S JUST, UM...

01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:53.610
JUST THE BIG...PICTURE
BECOMING CLEAR.

01:03:53.713 --> 01:03:55.913
YEAH.
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.551
YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW?

01:04:00.653 --> 01:04:03.321
NO.

01:04:09.295 --> 01:04:11.495
THERE YOU GO.
MADE YOU SOME HOT GREEN TEA,

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:12.930
AND I ORDERED CHINESE.

01:04:13.032 --> 01:04:15.199
CHICKEN AND VEGGIES ONLY.
NO CARBS.

01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:16.934
THANKS.

01:04:19.739 --> 01:04:23.140
BEN, HOW DID YOU FIRST
GET MY EMAIL ADDRESS?

01:04:23.243 --> 01:04:25.176
I OVERHEARD YOU
GIVING YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:26.978
TO YOUR FRIEND,
AND I WROTE IT DOWN.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.513
BUT WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:33.650
I KNOW THAT THAT'S...
CRAZY AND IT'S WRONG,

01:04:33.753 --> 01:04:35.052
BUT I DON'T REGRET IT,

01:04:35.154 --> 01:04:36.954
BECAUSE WE GOT TO
MEET EACH OTHER.

01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:39.423
CHLOE,
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU...

01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:42.760
WHICH WAS IN THE PARK
WALKING ACROSS THE BRIDGE,

01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:45.729
I WAS TAKEN.

01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:49.533
YOUR BLOND HAIR AND YOUR
WHITE DRESS WERE JUST...

01:04:49.635 --> 01:04:52.303
FLOWING IN THE WIND.

01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:56.040
TO ME, YOU LOOKED LIKE
AN ANGEL.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:58.642
BEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU--

01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:00.644
[phone rings]

01:05:00.746 --> 01:05:02.846
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

01:05:02.949 --> 01:05:04.348
[ringing]

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:06.384
YEAH.

NO. OKAY. YEAH. I-I'LL--
NO, TELL HIM NOT TO LEAVE.

01:05:09.088 --> 01:05:12.156
I'LL BE DOWN THERE
TO SIGN FOR IT. ALL RIGHT.

01:05:12.258 --> 01:05:13.490
THAT WAS JUST COLIN.

01:05:13.592 --> 01:05:15.092
WE'RE HAVING SOME PROOFS
DELIVERED,

01:05:15.194 --> 01:05:16.493
AND MY NAME IS ON THE BOX.
SO I HAVE TO GO DOWN

01:05:16.595 --> 01:05:18.296
AND SIGN FOR IT,
OR WE WON'T GET IT, OKAY?

01:05:18.398 --> 01:05:20.231
SO I-I'LL BE FIVE MINUTES,
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.765
OKAY?

01:05:21.867 --> 01:05:23.567
JUST KEEP DRINKING
THE HOT TEA,

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:25.202
'CAUSE YOU LOOK BETTER
ALREADY, OKAY?

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.307
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.676
[electronic whoosh]

01:06:08.025 --> 01:06:09.624
"DEAR C.

01:06:09.726 --> 01:06:12.093
"I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
SHOW UP TODAY.

01:06:12.195 --> 01:06:13.661
"I KNOW IT WAS WRONG,

01:06:13.763 --> 01:06:16.298
"AND I APOLOGIZE
IF I HURT YOU IN ANY WAY.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.634
"BUT I'VE REALIZED
WHAT WE'VE HAD ALL ALONG

01:06:19.736 --> 01:06:21.602
"IS JUST A FANTASY,

01:06:21.704 --> 01:06:25.006
"AND IT WAS PROBABLY FOOLISH
ON BOTH OF OUR PARTS

01:06:25.108 --> 01:06:28.143
TO THINK IT COULD EVER
BE MATCHED IN REALITY."

01:06:28.245 --> 01:06:29.644
NEED I GO ON?

01:06:29.746 --> 01:06:32.847
SECRET ADMIRER
WANTS TO STAY SECRET.

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.550
I NEED TO READ YOU
THIS PART.

01:06:35.652 --> 01:06:39.387
"PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU'LL
ALWAYS LIVE IN MY HEART

01:06:39.489 --> 01:06:41.722
"AND THAT NO ONE
CAN EVER TAKE AWAY

01:06:41.825 --> 01:06:43.992
THE JOY WE'VE SHARED."

01:06:45.662 --> 01:06:47.429
HI, CHLOE.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:49.130
OH, JUST IN WITH JIM.

01:06:49.232 --> 01:06:51.699
HE HAD A QUESTION
ABOUT ONE OF THE ACCOUNTS.

01:06:51.801 --> 01:06:53.234
I TAKE IT
ARTBOY DIDN'T SHOW?

01:06:53.337 --> 01:06:55.136
NOPE.

01:06:55.238 --> 01:06:56.571
WARM HEART, COLD FEET.

01:06:56.673 --> 01:06:58.974
IT'S ALL IN HERE.

01:07:00.844 --> 01:07:02.944
HONEY, I'M...
I'M SORRY.

01:07:03.046 --> 01:07:05.513
NOT YOUR FAULT.

01:07:08.618 --> 01:07:14.055
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH
I NEVER MET ARTBOY,

01:07:14.157 --> 01:07:16.391
I REALLY FELT LIKE
I KNEW HIM.

01:07:16.493 --> 01:07:19.560
BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT
SO MANY THINGS,

01:07:19.662 --> 01:07:20.928
LIKE LITTLE LIFE THINGS.

01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:22.197
- YOU KNOW?
- YEAH.

01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:23.698
I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.900
THAT AT LEAST
THAT PART WAS REAL.

01:07:26.003 --> 01:07:27.768
OH, CHLOE...

01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:30.372
YOU DIDN'T TELL BEN THAT I WAS
MEETING CYBER GUY, DID YOU?

01:07:30.474 --> 01:07:33.541
BEN?
NO. DEFINITELY NOT.

01:07:33.643 --> 01:07:35.176
OKAY. GOOD.

01:07:35.278 --> 01:07:37.145
IT'S ALL JUST TOO
MORTIFYING.

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:40.415
I REALLY DON'T WANT
ANYBODY ELSE TO KNOW, OKAY?

01:07:40.517 --> 01:07:42.583
LADIES, COMPANY MEETING
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:45.487
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'M JUST A MESSENGER.

01:07:45.588 --> 01:07:47.455
- CAN WE SHOOT YOU?
- [laughs] SHE'S VERY CUTE.

01:07:47.557 --> 01:07:48.890
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE

01:07:48.992 --> 01:07:50.758
FINALLY WARMING UP TO ME,
CHARLEY HORSE.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:53.861
YOU CALL ME THAT AGAIN,
AND I'LL PERSONALLY DISABLE YOU

01:07:53.963 --> 01:07:55.897
AND ENJOY EVERY SINGLE
SECOND OF IT.

01:07:55.999 --> 01:07:57.598
YES!

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:00.001
- I'M GETTING TO HER.
- YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING.

01:08:00.103 --> 01:08:01.636
I DON'T GET IT.

01:08:01.738 --> 01:08:03.505
I'M GONE FOR FIVE MINUTES,
AND THEN SHE LEAVES.

01:08:03.606 --> 01:08:05.240
AND THIS IS WHAT...I FIND.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.042
AND WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME--
WHAT-WHAT DOES

01:08:07.144 --> 01:08:09.177
"I NEED TIME TO THINK"
EVEN MEAN?

01:08:09.279 --> 01:08:11.812
I'M JUST RIFFING HERE,
BUT I'D SAY IT MEANS

01:08:11.915 --> 01:08:13.714
SHE NEEDS TIME TO THINK.

01:08:13.816 --> 01:08:15.616
I DON'T GET IT, YOU KNOW?

01:08:15.718 --> 01:08:17.952
- SHE SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE.
- MAYBE.

01:08:18.055 --> 01:08:19.187
BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS...

01:08:19.288 --> 01:08:22.122
WHY DID SHE
EMAIL ARTBOY AGAIN?

01:08:22.225 --> 01:08:26.227
TEAM, WE'RE GATHERED HERE
TO BID FOND FAREWELL TO VAL

01:08:26.328 --> 01:08:28.563

AND YOU DESERVE BETTER.

01:09:39.336 --> 01:09:40.968
I WAS WAITING TO SEE
HOW THINGS PLAYED OUT

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:42.737
WITH THE JOB AND WITH ARTBOY
BEFORE I BROUGHT THIS UP,

01:09:42.839 --> 01:09:44.705
BUT, UH,

BUT...IF YOU'RE UP
FOR THE CHALLENGE...

01:09:58.688 --> 01:09:59.987
