00:48.093 --> 00:50.406
Kreotoxismus?

00:51.145 --> 00:52.924
Meat poisoning.

00:53.277 --> 00:56.286
The two types of brain contusions?

00:56.406 --> 00:58.916
Circumcised and diffused.

00:59.036 --> 01:02.311
- Ptomaines?
- You're off the subject.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.286
- Answer the question!
- They are the chemical salts

01:05.286 --> 01:07.512
formed during putrefaction.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.460
Last one. Hypospadias?

01:11.569 --> 01:15.794
- Malformation of the penis.
- That's very good, Miss James.

01:15.914 --> 01:18.242
This is really the most
tremendous exercise.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.436
And it's so much easier
to go through the city.

01:20.471 --> 01:24.075
And unlike bicycling,
one can go hands-free! Oh!

01:24.729 --> 01:26.915
Hey! Watch where you're going!

01:29.350 --> 01:30.876
Are you two all right?

01:31.282 --> 01:33.015
Dr. Ogden.

01:33.462 --> 01:36.853
- Nina Bloom.
- Of course. Nina.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.714
This is my associate,
Miss Rebecca James.

01:39.748 --> 01:42.554
- And this is my friend, Miss Lydia Hall.
- Charmed.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.627
Those girls have some nerve.
They nearly knocked us over, too.

01:45.676 --> 01:47.910
YOU SHOULD WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!

01:48.495 --> 01:51.603
- May we skate with you?
- Yes. Of course.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.622
- It's great for the legs.
- And what's good for the legs is good for business.

01:54.657 --> 01:58.040
- And what is it you do?
- We're dancers, performers.

01:58.088 --> 02:00.495
Really. I should come
and see you sometime.

02:00.818 --> 02:04.236
Well, I'm not sure it would
be your cup of tea, but um,

02:04.356 --> 02:07.028
- if you have a gentleman friend...
- Help!

02:07.902 --> 02:11.007
- Over here!
- I think we may be needed.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.319
Excuse me, sir.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.064
What happened to her?

02:24.137 --> 02:26.008
Her neck has been broken.

02:31.702 --> 02:33.366
It's been a terrible day.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.690
- It's been an unfortunate one.
- Excuse me, ladies.

02:35.745 --> 02:37.993
You there. Stop. Please.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.951
Miss Bloom?

02:41.693 --> 02:43.406
I didn't realize it was you.

02:43.646 --> 02:46.300
Well, she does look
different with her clothes on.

02:47.848 --> 02:50.633
- Are you well?
- Yes.

02:51.857 --> 02:54.306
Uh, William,

02:54.426 --> 02:58.170
Miss Bloom and her friend arrived
about the same time as we did.

02:58.211 --> 03:02.042
- She could probably leave.
- Right, uh, thank you, ladies.

03:05.157 --> 03:06.910
Miss James.

03:07.110 --> 03:09.325
Her name was Lea Palmer.

03:12.632 --> 03:16.934
Julia, is there anything that
requires our immediate attention?

03:16.951 --> 03:20.087
It appears to be a tragic accident,

03:20.158 --> 03:23.096
which is why I do wish you
would change hobbies, I...

03:23.151 --> 03:26.163
Well, I'll give it up the
moment you give up your bicycle.

03:28.449 --> 03:31.508
This gentleman says he saw something.

03:32.234 --> 03:34.726
I'll let you know if the post
mortem reveals anything else.

03:34.846 --> 03:36.272
Hello, sir?

03:37.515 --> 03:41.478
- Your name, sir?
- Edwin Thornburg, man about town.

03:41.984 --> 03:43.651
I understand you saw something?

03:43.681 --> 03:46.885
I see a lot of things.
Especially after dark.

03:46.918 --> 03:49.207
You can't imagine some of them.

03:49.278 --> 03:53.052
Specific to the fate
of this woman, please.

03:53.239 --> 03:56.980
Oh. I saw her skating,
down here, by herself.

03:57.701 --> 04:00.171
That's all I see down here these days.

04:00.291 --> 04:01.755
Foolishness.

04:02.553 --> 04:05.199
- And then?
- Well,

04:05.203 --> 04:07.218
I turned away, heard a scream

04:07.238 --> 04:09.220
and she was gone, as
far as I could tell.

04:09.340 --> 04:12.273
Did you not go look for her
to see if she was alright?

04:12.493 --> 04:15.078
I thought she just skated away.

04:15.266 --> 04:16.213
Ah.

04:17.197 --> 04:18.523
Anything else?

04:18.721 --> 04:21.151
I saw another skater down there.

04:21.271 --> 04:23.628
- Male or female?
- Couldn't tell.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.879
Didn't see them so much as
I heard someone skating away.

04:26.896 --> 04:29.026
- So someone else was with her.
- Well,

04:29.405 --> 04:31.428
I never saw them together.

04:31.924 --> 04:34.542
Right. Thank you.

04:37.618 --> 04:38.834
Sir.

04:39.132 --> 04:43.105
- Find anything, George?
- I'll say. Have a look at this.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.014
A roller skating competition.

04:46.544 --> 04:49.546
Anything pertaining
to this case, George?

04:49.581 --> 04:51.548
No, sir. However,

04:51.583 --> 04:53.884
I'll wager Miss Cherry
would love to see this.

05:00.338 --> 05:02.064
Yes, that's Mother.

05:03.934 --> 05:05.426
What happened?

05:05.964 --> 05:09.738
She appears to have fallen and
broken her neck. Roller skating.

05:10.089 --> 05:13.376
- That's impossible.
- She was a very experienced skater.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.138
She was known for her dance skating.

05:15.173 --> 05:16.581
Few were better in the world.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.199
She didn't fall.

05:18.215 --> 05:20.168
Miss Palmer. A witness claims

05:20.190 --> 05:22.903
he may have seen
someone with your mother.

05:23.214 --> 05:25.515
Is it possible someone pushed her?

05:25.550 --> 05:27.452
Well, that's it. She was killed.

05:27.572 --> 05:30.368
Why does she keep going on about
Mother being a terrible skater?

05:31.336 --> 05:34.709
Well, usually when someone
is approached by an assailant,

05:34.731 --> 05:37.519
there are indications on the
body that they fought back.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.230
In this case there were none.

05:39.350 --> 05:41.624
Well, perhaps she was taken by surprise.

05:41.888 --> 05:44.835
Do you know of anyone who may
have wished your mother harm?

05:45.750 --> 05:48.160
No, she was a very quiet woman.

05:48.231 --> 05:49.161
Well-liked.

05:49.661 --> 05:52.230
No one she would have known would
have wanted to cause her any harm.

05:52.632 --> 05:53.842
No one?

05:55.118 --> 05:56.742
I don't know. You'll
have to ask my father.

05:56.753 --> 05:59.272
- That is if you can find him.
- You're estranged.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.676
No, I adore him. But he's a drunkard.

06:01.698 --> 06:04.570
Oh my God, Sophie. I just heard.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.303
What happened?

06:06.491 --> 06:08.751
These people think that
Mother fell and broke her neck,

06:08.762 --> 06:11.182
but that's not the
case. She was murdered.

06:11.512 --> 06:14.032
Let us get out of this awful place.

06:18.313 --> 06:20.002
So, that's the fiancÃ©.

06:20.623 --> 06:23.313
- She does not like him.
- Oh, you noticed.

06:25.019 --> 06:26.609
A roller skating race?

06:26.644 --> 06:29.249
Not just any race, the Buffalo
Queens are going to be there.

06:29.369 --> 06:31.273
That hardly changes things, George.

06:31.455 --> 06:32.979
But I have a previous engagement

06:32.979 --> 06:34.333
and I was hoping you would accompany me.

06:34.349 --> 06:37.193
- Oh?
- It's a lecture on entrepreneurship,

06:37.215 --> 06:39.146
about how the books
written by Horatio Alger

06:39.163 --> 06:40.296
need not be seen as a myth.

06:40.329 --> 06:42.659
From all reports, it's
incredibly inspiring.

06:43.189 --> 06:44.619
Yes, it sounds it.

06:44.658 --> 06:47.508
And it would be of great
benefit to a man like yourself,

06:47.568 --> 06:50.242
a man who needs to learn to pull
himself up by his bootstraps.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.782
- Well, I suppose it would be informative.
- So you'll come then?

06:56.414 --> 06:57.954
Yes, of course.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.775
That's wonderful, George. Thank you.

06:59.951 --> 07:01.317
Also, I just remembered.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.539
The roller skating actually
takes place over two nights.

07:03.578 --> 07:04.931
So does the lecture.

07:05.751 --> 07:07.627
And we'll be attending both nights?

07:07.632 --> 07:08.892
Of course!

07:12.308 --> 07:14.966
Admirable display of
backbone there, bugalugs.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.066
Sir?

07:16.302 --> 07:19.576
Not even man and wife and she's
already wearing the trousers.

07:25.336 --> 07:26.915
Did you see these?

07:27.377 --> 07:29.622
Those are the ones that
nearly knocked us over.

07:31.036 --> 07:32.615
Oh, yes, I believe they are.

07:32.631 --> 07:34.738
Nothing but a bunch of
big shots from Buffalo

07:34.744 --> 07:36.482
skating around like they own the place.

07:36.602 --> 07:38.982
- Oh, well, they...
- You know what I'm going to do?

07:39.161 --> 07:40.251
I'm going to show them.

07:40.966 --> 07:42.512
I'm going to enter that race.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.932
Rebecca, revenge is never a good idea.

07:45.052 --> 07:46.077
I don't care,

07:46.434 --> 07:48.222
I'm going to run them into the ground.

07:48.693 --> 07:50.978
They are professional, Rebecca.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.592
- Are you sure you're good enough?
- Oh, I am good enough.

08:03.207 --> 08:04.318
Mr. Palmer.

08:04.521 --> 08:07.432
- I'm Detective William...
- I know who you are.

08:09.687 --> 08:11.739
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.379
You know who I'm sorry for?

08:13.499 --> 08:14.666
Sophie.

08:14.913 --> 08:17.648
Going through her life without
her mother. What happened?

08:18.038 --> 08:19.991
That's what I'm
endeavouring to find out.

08:20.008 --> 08:22.793
Then why are you wasting
your time talking to me?

08:24.399 --> 08:26.962
Is it possible someone who held a grudge

08:26.964 --> 08:28.887
against you took it out on your wife?

08:28.904 --> 08:33.025
My wife went roller skating
and she fell down. Nothing more.

08:33.701 --> 08:35.302
Your daughter Sophie said

08:35.306 --> 08:38.058
she was much too fine a skater
for that to have occurred.

08:38.073 --> 08:40.241
She was no longer a
young woman, Detective.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.265
She could have easily stumbled and fell.

08:42.784 --> 08:46.448
It is a risky business, this skating.

08:49.083 --> 08:52.588
You and your family recently
moved here from Buffalo?

08:52.648 --> 08:53.754
Yes.

08:54.459 --> 08:57.528
I understand you left
behind several creditors.

08:57.562 --> 08:59.553
I'm endeavouring to repay them.

08:59.795 --> 09:03.467
And you've picked up a few
here since you've arrived.

09:04.228 --> 09:07.137
No one killed my wife
to get back at me, sir.

09:09.801 --> 09:12.657
Were you home yesterday
evening when your wife set out?

09:12.689 --> 09:14.757
- I was.
- Do you know where she was going?

09:14.785 --> 09:16.089
No.

09:16.309 --> 09:19.279
She said there was some
kind of skating exhibition

09:19.334 --> 09:22.252
down by Cherry Street. Maybe
she was on her way there.

09:28.852 --> 09:31.828
Rolling around with wheels on
your feet, bloody ridiculous.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.133
A passing fad, I'm sure.

09:36.581 --> 09:38.034
Nothing but a menace to
the roads, if you ask me.

09:38.069 --> 09:40.305
- Worse than the automobile.
- Or the bicycle?

09:40.338 --> 09:43.100
- Don't be smart, Murdoch.
- Couldn't help it.

09:48.707 --> 09:50.885
Toronto's finest, no doubt.

09:51.474 --> 09:54.643
- I beg your pardon?
- I hope you're accustomed to losing.

09:55.017 --> 09:58.428
Oh, but of course you would
be. You are Canadian after all.

10:00.117 --> 10:03.957
- Don't let her bother you, Rebecca.
- Oh, are you going to race too?

10:04.195 --> 10:06.048
No, that would be silly.

10:06.065 --> 10:08.673
You're far too frail to
compete against real women.

10:09.184 --> 10:10.879
- Rebecca?
- Doctor?

10:10.928 --> 10:12.959
You need to trounce these women.

10:17.558 --> 10:20.066
I must say, Murdoch, maybe I was wrong.

10:20.099 --> 10:23.076
It's actually quite impressive when
you sit down and watch it in person.

10:23.196 --> 10:24.638
Detective.

10:25.441 --> 10:26.822
Miss Palmer.

10:27.603 --> 10:28.985
Inspector Brackenreid,

10:29.020 --> 10:30.568
- Miss Palmer.
- Nice to meet you.

10:30.579 --> 10:32.870
- This is my fiancÃ©, Herschel.
- Gentlemen.

10:33.643 --> 10:35.125
What are you doing here?

10:35.415 --> 10:37.143
Signing up for the race, of course.

10:37.263 --> 10:40.262
- You skate as well?
- Something she's always loved.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.020
Hard to keep her away from it, even
in difficult times such as these.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.417
I have something that might be
of interest to you, Detective.

10:46.435 --> 10:48.641
I was going through my mother's things

10:48.647 --> 10:51.078
and I found something truly awful.

10:51.611 --> 10:52.723
A letter?

10:52.843 --> 10:54.892
From when we were
still living in Buffalo.

10:55.012 --> 10:58.224
Whoever wrote it said that they'd
kill her if she didn't leave town.

10:58.246 --> 10:59.842
So you don't know who wrote it?

10:59.875 --> 11:03.049
From the content, it seems to
be one of her former students.

11:03.169 --> 11:06.922
- She was a teacher?
- She taught skate dancing, back in Buffalo.

11:07.715 --> 11:10.729
- And who were her students?
- Some of them are right here.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.171
The Buffalo Queens.

11:24.281 --> 11:27.280
I must say Murdoch, I'm
starting to see the appeal.

11:27.582 --> 11:28.891
Sir?

11:29.011 --> 11:30.696
They're real competitors, these ladies.

11:30.707 --> 11:32.528
They're not just
beautiful women on wheels.

11:32.594 --> 11:34.778
One of them may be a killer.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.337
What about the daughter?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.862
Back on skates before her
mother's body is even cold.

11:39.890 --> 11:41.397
She is of interest.

11:41.517 --> 11:44.652
But one of these skaters may
have threatened our victim's life.

11:45.417 --> 11:48.893
Whoever wrote this letter
is our prime suspect.

11:49.075 --> 11:52.227
"We're in control. You'll
never be able to stop us."

11:52.590 --> 11:53.867
What's that about?

11:53.928 --> 11:55.798
That's what I intend to find out.

11:56.535 --> 11:57.812
Ladies.

11:58.081 --> 12:01.256
Mrs. Palmer was a hideous old shrew.

12:01.376 --> 12:04.650
And yet you took skating
lessons from her for years.

12:04.694 --> 12:06.656
We all did. She made us better,

12:06.667 --> 12:09.671
no matter how cruel
and controlling she was.

12:10.012 --> 12:13.054
Did Mrs. Palmer ever compete?

12:13.087 --> 12:14.721
She was a skate dancer.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.680
She only taught agility and footwork.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.180
She thought racing was
grotesque. Unladylike.

12:20.587 --> 12:21.874
She disapproved.

12:21.890 --> 12:24.168
Yeah. She was stuck in
the nineteenth century.

12:24.288 --> 12:26.088
She didn't like that we
dressed the way we wanted,

12:26.116 --> 12:27.662
that we did what we wanted.

12:28.553 --> 12:30.677
And all of the skaters felt this way?

12:30.858 --> 12:33.950
Well, Laura was always fond of her.

12:34.610 --> 12:35.798
Why was that?

12:35.985 --> 12:37.466
Because she was the weakest skater,

12:37.466 --> 12:39.463
so naturally she was the teacher's pet.

12:39.754 --> 12:42.297
She was just so desperate
to make it on the tour.

12:42.671 --> 12:45.317
And yet she is now on the tour.

12:45.570 --> 12:47.743
That's only because Sophie left.

12:48.188 --> 12:49.299
Sophie Palmer?

12:50.042 --> 12:52.903
- She was once a Buffalo Queen?
- Of course.

12:52.958 --> 12:55.478
And then when she left,
Laura took her spot.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.428
Miss Howard, is it not true

12:59.444 --> 13:01.782
that Sophie Palmer's
departure allowed you

13:01.798 --> 13:03.437
to join the Queens?

13:03.734 --> 13:06.089
Yes, but I would have
become a Queen eventually,

13:06.133 --> 13:08.012
Sophie Palmer or not.

13:08.465 --> 13:11.551
But you forced Sophie
Palmer to leave the team.

13:11.716 --> 13:13.224
Sorry, what do you mean?

13:14.638 --> 13:16.183
This letter

13:16.409 --> 13:19.957
was written to Mrs. Palmer
warning her to leave Buffalo.

13:19.963 --> 13:23.324
- And threatens her life.
- Well, who would do such a thing?

13:23.368 --> 13:26.163
Miss Howard, as you are the
one with something to gain,

13:26.201 --> 13:29.931
I am suggesting that you
would do such a thing.

13:31.230 --> 13:33.535
Me? Write this?

13:34.158 --> 13:37.236
Well, I never wrote so
many words in my life.

13:39.046 --> 13:42.005
- Miss Dalton...
- Let me guess, you're already married.

13:42.462 --> 13:45.799
- Pardon?
- I'm sorry, please excuse my rudeness.

13:47.171 --> 13:48.847
Uh, this letter would indicate...

13:48.863 --> 13:50.965
How is a woman expected
to marry when every man

13:50.976 --> 13:53.495
that she encounters is spoken for?

13:53.615 --> 13:54.904
Yes.

13:55.657 --> 13:57.742
This threatening
letter was found amongst

13:57.748 --> 13:59.404
Mrs. Palmer's personal effects,

13:59.415 --> 14:02.451
and I believe it was
written by a Buffalo Queen.

14:02.479 --> 14:05.087
Why are you talking to me?
I never met Mrs. Palmer.

14:06.385 --> 14:08.734
- She taught all of you.
- Not me.

14:08.751 --> 14:11.385
My mother could never
afford the lessons.

14:12.287 --> 14:14.911
I had no ill will towards Mrs. Palmer.

14:15.736 --> 14:17.084
Ah.

14:18.498 --> 14:20.649
Thank you, Miss Dalton.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.515
Happily married?

14:25.848 --> 14:28.356
Look, I'd think I did
it too if I were you.

14:28.664 --> 14:31.569
You probably heard about the time
I slapped Mrs. Palmer in the face

14:31.597 --> 14:33.066
for looking at me funny.

14:33.512 --> 14:34.623
No.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.715
Oh. Well, one time I slapped
Mrs. Palmer in the face

14:37.748 --> 14:39.168
for looking at me funny.

14:39.740 --> 14:43.102
You certainly aren't helping
your case here, Miss Preston.

14:43.135 --> 14:44.708
What do you want me to say?

14:44.747 --> 14:46.045
That I wrote the letter?

14:46.491 --> 14:48.157
Fine, I wrote the letter.

14:50.116 --> 14:52.498
You threatened to kill Mrs. Palmer.

14:52.702 --> 14:53.670
Sure.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.680
But I wouldn't be saying all of
this if I'd killed her, right?

14:57.054 --> 14:58.335
I don't know.

14:58.919 --> 15:02.159
Why would you be bothered
to utter empty threats?

15:02.186 --> 15:04.205
She said exactly the same thing to me.

15:04.325 --> 15:07.396
- She said she was going to kill you?
- Surely did.

15:08.661 --> 15:10.350
Sophie and I were always close,

15:10.355 --> 15:12.595
so her mother decided
that I was to blame

15:12.611 --> 15:14.614
for ruining her life and morals.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.892
Told me to leave town or she'd kill me.

15:17.552 --> 15:20.363
Did anyone witness her
uttering this threat?

15:20.385 --> 15:24.186
- Well, she didn't utter it, she wrote it.
- A letter.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.802
- Do you have it?
- Sure, I carry it around with me everywhere I go.

15:28.239 --> 15:31.273
Please answer my questions
directly, Miss Preston,

15:31.295 --> 15:33.408
and you can keep your
sarcasm to yourself.

15:33.463 --> 15:36.378
Or what? I'll get a spanking?

15:39.376 --> 15:41.313
What did you mean when you wrote,

15:41.324 --> 15:43.821
"You'll never be able to stop us."

15:44.443 --> 15:47.930
Mrs. Palmer always acted like
she was in control of everything,

15:48.328 --> 15:51.233
every one of us, every
bit of our whole lives.

15:51.558 --> 15:53.830
But she couldn't stop us from skating.

15:54.010 --> 15:55.476
Not even her own daughter.

15:55.502 --> 15:56.748
But she did,

15:56.932 --> 15:58.882
by moving her family to Toronto.

15:59.384 --> 16:00.611
For a while.

16:00.731 --> 16:02.434
Until Sophie did what she had to do.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.699
"Did what she had to do?"

16:05.712 --> 16:07.921
Sophie might come across as innocent,

16:08.511 --> 16:10.615
but she always gets what she wants.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.819
If she wanted to skate,
she'd stop at nothing.

16:17.024 --> 16:19.079
Could someone really
kill their own mother

16:19.084 --> 16:21.452
simply to be able to go roller skating?

16:21.491 --> 16:23.912
Roller racing. Something she's good at.

16:24.510 --> 16:26.922
What if someone stopped
you from being a Detective?

16:27.806 --> 16:29.501
I wouldn't kill them, sir.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.640
A few weeks of idleness
sitting around with the missus

16:32.658 --> 16:33.916
and you might change your tune.

16:34.273 --> 16:35.351
Sirs.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.939
I've been informed Miss Palmer
is back at the roller rink.

16:38.001 --> 16:39.149
Thank you, George.

16:39.352 --> 16:40.888
Do you need any help at the rink, sir?

16:40.945 --> 16:43.428
Oh, I think the Inspector
and I can handle it, thanks.

16:43.472 --> 16:44.537
Oh.

16:48.014 --> 16:49.801
Alright, Crabtree, out
with it, what's wrong?

16:49.810 --> 16:50.835
Oh, nothing.

16:51.060 --> 16:54.924
I'm just about to miss a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, that's all.

16:55.501 --> 16:57.221
What? This roller racing?

16:57.274 --> 16:58.950
Sir, it's not just roller racing.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.226
It's the Buffalo Queens. The finest,

17:01.287 --> 17:03.773
fastest, fittest group
of women on wheels

17:03.804 --> 17:05.173
the world has ever seen.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.501
Tickets are only twenty-five
cents for two nights.

17:07.536 --> 17:10.137
- I've got mine.
- Yes, well, I'm otherwise spoken for.

17:10.176 --> 17:13.258
I've told Miss Cherry that
I'll attend a lecture on

17:13.280 --> 17:16.398
Horatio Alger and self
achievement in the new century.

17:16.519 --> 17:18.111
Oh, that sounds interesting.

17:18.441 --> 17:20.196
Sir, they're roller racing.

17:20.237 --> 17:23.132
Women flying at high speeds,

17:23.198 --> 17:25.298
danger, thrills!

17:25.417 --> 17:27.296
I'm sure I've never seen
anything like it in my life

17:27.335 --> 17:29.065
and may never have the chance again.

17:29.593 --> 17:31.155
Listen, Crabtree.

17:31.331 --> 17:32.621
I've met Miss Cherry.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.879
In fact, Murdoch and I
have had a word about it.

17:35.350 --> 17:36.186
Sir?

17:36.569 --> 17:39.108
We all know you've had your
fair share of heartbreak.

17:39.139 --> 17:41.213
Some of it not entirely
of your own making.

17:41.380 --> 17:44.620
Women who've left you to follow
their dreams, careers, passions.

17:45.014 --> 17:47.207
- Women who've left you for other women!
- Inspector!

17:47.246 --> 17:50.513
But now you have the perfect
woman staring you in the face,

17:50.524 --> 17:51.966
ready to take the next step.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.396
I'm not exactly sure what
you're trying to say, sir.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.323
If you let this one get away,
Crabtree, you're a damn fool!

17:59.035 --> 18:00.034
Right, well,

18:00.492 --> 18:02.257
I'll attend the lecture then, I suppose.

18:02.336 --> 18:04.224
Of course you'll attend
the bloody lecture!

18:04.237 --> 18:06.402
You'll watch paint dry all
night if she asks you to.

18:06.693 --> 18:08.079
Keep her happy until you're married,

18:08.088 --> 18:10.214
then you can do whatever you
like. Isn't that right, Murdoch?

18:10.334 --> 18:13.507
Well, Julia and I take a
more egalitarian approach

18:13.516 --> 18:15.501
to decision making, but...

18:15.902 --> 18:18.495
Miss Cherry does seem
a fine choice, George.

18:18.789 --> 18:21.439
Try not to fumble this one, bugalugs.

18:32.873 --> 18:34.977
She has wonderful technique.

18:36.338 --> 18:37.962
It's just roller skating, Doctor.

18:38.292 --> 18:40.185
You can either do it or you can't.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.871
- Isn't that... ?
- Sophie Palmer.

18:43.991 --> 18:47.117
- Our victim's daughter.
- Not one for mourning.

18:49.983 --> 18:51.936
She's incredibly fast.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.166
I'm going to be faster.

18:55.837 --> 18:57.279
Julia?

18:57.312 --> 19:00.453
- Miss James!
- You two ladies playing truant?

19:00.486 --> 19:03.192
Just watching the skating, Inspector.

19:06.829 --> 19:07.924
Hey!

19:08.507 --> 19:10.972
That girl's got some guts.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.327
Indeed.

19:14.284 --> 19:17.673
It's true, mother and I didn't
exactly see eye-to-eye. What of it?

19:17.701 --> 19:19.174
She wouldn't let you race.

19:19.196 --> 19:22.150
And so I killed her? That's mad.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.560
You re-entered the
racing world the very day

19:24.588 --> 19:26.398
you found out your mother was dead.

19:27.317 --> 19:29.226
She didn't approve of me racing.

19:29.512 --> 19:31.569
I don't need her approval anymore.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.661
Where were you the night
your mother was killed?

19:35.497 --> 19:37.764
You really think I'm the one who did it.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.003
You kept your true feelings about
your mother concealed from us.

19:41.201 --> 19:43.102
And what was I meant to do?

19:43.137 --> 19:44.618
Speak ill of the dead?

19:44.932 --> 19:47.868
Proclaim to the world that
she was awful and overbearing

19:47.886 --> 19:49.206
and that I hated her?

19:49.955 --> 19:52.589
And even if that's true,
she was still my mother.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.879
Maybe you should focus on
finding out who wrote that letter.

19:55.907 --> 19:57.050
We did.

19:57.310 --> 19:59.599
Then what are you
doing speaking with me?

19:59.887 --> 20:01.458
The Queens detested Mother.

20:01.513 --> 20:03.779
- Now if you'll excuse me...
- Where were you that night?

20:04.060 --> 20:05.595
I was at home.

20:05.715 --> 20:07.075
With my father.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.242
He'll tell you the same.

20:10.898 --> 20:12.263
Do you believe her?

20:12.312 --> 20:15.245
Well, her father did say that
they were home together last night.

20:15.278 --> 20:18.799
Still. There's a hatred
in her, you can feel it.

20:19.416 --> 20:22.214
I say that we should...

20:27.859 --> 20:30.962
- Help me! I'm gonna die! Help!
- Miss Palmer?

20:31.204 --> 20:33.905
- What's happened?
- I was attacked!

20:34.025 --> 20:36.815
- By who?
- Who do you think? The Queens!

20:36.824 --> 20:38.587
I told you they're out of their minds!

20:39.110 --> 20:42.075
Why? WHY??

20:42.372 --> 20:45.247
WHY?? WHY??

20:47.169 --> 20:48.725
Was it a man or a woman?

20:48.797 --> 20:50.607
Like I said, I couldn't see a thing.

20:50.618 --> 20:52.857
They came in, they
turned out the lights,

20:52.890 --> 20:54.441
everything was black...

20:54.452 --> 20:56.015
the next thing I know,

20:56.053 --> 20:57.847
I could feel someone near me,

20:57.967 --> 21:00.808
and then I heard the most
awful, horrible sound.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.675
Then the most awful, horrible pain.

21:04.737 --> 21:07.641
- Then you believe it was one of the Queens.
- Who else?

21:07.641 --> 21:09.375
They knew they couldn't beat me.

21:09.446 --> 21:12.362
Now they don't have to worry. The
doctor says I'll never skate again.

21:14.287 --> 21:17.142
- Would somebody help me?!!
- McNabb.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.759
Do you think the attacker and
the killer are one and the same?

21:28.436 --> 21:30.675
Difficult to say with
any certainty, sir.

21:31.038 --> 21:33.277
But even if they aren't,
perhaps finding one

21:33.307 --> 21:34.867
will lead to the other.

21:35.829 --> 21:39.345
How could you? She'll never skate again!

21:39.380 --> 21:40.752
I didn't do a thing.

21:40.807 --> 21:42.563
- Liar!
- Ha.

21:42.612 --> 21:44.532
Listen, old man. If I did it,

21:44.543 --> 21:46.689
I'd be boasting about it all over town.

21:46.809 --> 21:48.187
Ah!!

21:51.645 --> 21:54.164
The girl made short work of you there.

21:54.725 --> 21:56.195
They're vicious.

21:56.230 --> 21:58.331
You saw what they did to my Sophie.

21:58.365 --> 22:00.166
How can you be sure it was them?

22:00.200 --> 22:01.520
Who else would have done it?

22:01.640 --> 22:03.017
That's what your daughter said

22:03.028 --> 22:05.564
but I'm afraid circumstance
is not the same as evidence.

22:05.570 --> 22:08.255
All she ever wanted was to skate.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.104
And now that's been taken from her.

22:11.924 --> 22:13.365
Forever.

22:14.504 --> 22:17.261
Sir, shall we speak with the skaters?

22:19.401 --> 22:20.753
Sir?

22:23.225 --> 22:25.987
- Ladies, a word.
- Hold it, Murdoch.

22:26.042 --> 22:27.165
Sir,

22:27.621 --> 22:29.767
we need to establish where they all were

22:29.794 --> 22:32.319
- at the time of Miss Palmer's attack.
- In a minute.

22:33.155 --> 22:34.289
Watch.

22:34.888 --> 22:36.358
Bloody good, aren't they?

22:39.906 --> 22:42.563
Yes. Very fast.

22:43.047 --> 22:44.777
More than just fast.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.992
Be that as it may.

22:50.473 --> 22:51.860
Stop!

23:15.378 --> 23:18.144
Constable. A bite to
eat before our lecture?

23:18.178 --> 23:20.114
Louise, I...

23:24.985 --> 23:28.591
- I was about to come talk to you.
- Are you alright, George?

23:28.812 --> 23:31.545
I think it's just a
common cold, but it's...

23:31.590 --> 23:35.936
it's uncommon in that it's
so bad, it's... I have...

23:36.002 --> 23:39.099
- I have a really bad cold.
- I see.

23:39.528 --> 23:41.401
Well, you can't be
attending the lecture.

23:41.685 --> 23:43.536
I don't think I can.

23:43.570 --> 23:46.445
- I'm terribly disappointed.
- Head straight home.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.592
And telephone me if it gets
any worse, I can pop right over.

23:50.104 --> 23:51.577
You'll be at the lecture.

23:52.017 --> 23:53.846
I'm not going without you, George.

23:53.881 --> 23:55.732
If I went alone, some
aspiring businessman

23:55.743 --> 23:57.608
might think I'm there
looking for a husband.

23:58.054 --> 24:00.964
I'm sorry, Louise, I didn't
mean to ruin your night as well.

24:01.339 --> 24:04.189
Miss Cherry, I couldn't
help but overhear.

24:04.224 --> 24:06.207
If you're without plans
this evening, you're welcome

24:06.226 --> 24:07.973
to join me at the roller races.

24:08.826 --> 24:10.201
Oh, George.

24:10.245 --> 24:13.255
It appears the whole city
is swept up in roller fever.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.522
I'm afraid I should decline; I'm
not much good at sporting events.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.871
I can never get past the 'why' of it.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.388
Who cares who's the fastest?

24:21.446 --> 24:24.043
I suppose it's nice for them, but
what does it matter to anyone else?

24:24.466 --> 24:27.503
I don't know. I find it hard
to turn away from the pursuit

24:27.514 --> 24:31.145
of human excellence in any
form, no matter how trivial.

24:31.756 --> 24:34.331
Hm! I never thought of it that way.

24:34.364 --> 24:35.959
Well, no, nor should you.

24:35.964 --> 24:38.958
I mean, we can't all be fanatics.

24:38.992 --> 24:41.092
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Louise.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.506
Indeed.

24:42.891 --> 24:45.186
And I just wanted to say
I'm very much looking forward

24:45.203 --> 24:46.490
to our dinner on Sunday.

24:46.610 --> 24:50.720
Oh, as am I, and the Detective.
We'll be glad to have you.

24:51.959 --> 24:54.346
Goodbye, George. Rest up.

24:59.314 --> 25:01.013
I like her.

25:01.261 --> 25:04.634
She's strong, opinionated, kind...

25:04.700 --> 25:06.901
She's certainly beautiful.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.875
She's lovely, George.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.041
I know.

25:18.198 --> 25:19.879
Well, depending who you ask,

25:20.072 --> 25:21.849
none of them could have done it.

25:21.969 --> 25:24.417
And... any of them could have done it.

25:24.537 --> 25:27.073
I don't understand, sir.
If they're all lying anyway,

25:27.107 --> 25:29.759
why not at least get
their stories straight?

25:30.700 --> 25:32.455
They all travel together,

25:32.488 --> 25:36.349
but competed against one
another. Friends and rivals.

25:36.469 --> 25:38.539
Now, some of them have
been trying to help

25:38.552 --> 25:41.642
while some of them have been lying
to make the others look guilty.

25:42.010 --> 25:43.865
Right. Perhaps then, sir,

25:43.881 --> 25:45.591
the answer lies with
the victim's loved ones.

25:45.757 --> 25:49.168
Ah, yes. Mrs. Palmer's husband
and daughter provided alibis

25:49.184 --> 25:51.703
that are impossible to
prove one way or the other.

25:51.747 --> 25:54.086
Just as suspicious as the Queens, then.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.864
I suppose, sir, the skater with the most

25:56.891 --> 25:59.205
immediate motive would be Sophie Palmer.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.641
Yes. Her mother was controlling.

26:01.675 --> 26:05.259
But I remain skeptical that
merely keeping her daughter

26:05.287 --> 26:08.028
from skating could be motive for murder.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.165
Good luck out there.

26:11.585 --> 26:13.329
I don't need luck.

26:13.329 --> 26:15.988
No, I suppose not.
You'll lose all the same.

26:18.058 --> 26:19.810
I've found something, Murdoch.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.258
- About the killer?
- About the Buffalo Queens.

26:22.378 --> 26:24.591
- Which one?
- All of them.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.215
They're a team, Murdoch.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.102
They pretend to race
against one another,

26:29.135 --> 26:30.923
but they're always working together.

26:31.193 --> 26:33.220
Still, one of them has to win.

26:33.245 --> 26:36.890
They take turns. I got
Jackson to pull newspapers

26:36.930 --> 26:38.355
from all the cities
where they've been on tour

26:38.366 --> 26:39.863
and put together the results.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.129
They don't win every race,
that would be too obvious.

26:42.151 --> 26:43.367
But when they do win,

26:43.730 --> 26:46.579
it's already settled which one
of them will take the trophy.

26:46.854 --> 26:49.885
This time it will be Mildred
Preston, mark my words.

26:50.005 --> 26:51.514
So they're cheating.

26:51.634 --> 26:53.774
They work together to
ensure that they win

26:53.819 --> 26:55.862
the bulk of the prize money
and then divide it evenly.

26:55.896 --> 26:58.931
It's not about the prize
money. Don't you see?

26:59.145 --> 27:01.634
They decide ahead of time who wins.

27:03.029 --> 27:05.304
- They're placing bets.
- Exactly.

27:05.597 --> 27:08.040
And hitting blackjack every time.

27:11.550 --> 27:14.647
- Thank you, my good man. Ah!
- Hiya, George.

27:14.681 --> 27:18.674
George? Ha, ha, ha! This is so funny.

27:18.713 --> 27:21.332
This happens to me all the
time. I have a twin brother

27:21.354 --> 27:24.028
- named George and he very rarely mentions me...
- Oh, can it.

27:24.199 --> 27:26.192
You're not very good at faking a cough.

27:26.226 --> 27:28.108
I'm sorry, Louise. It's just that...

27:28.160 --> 27:30.625
- I so badly didn't want to disappoint you that...
- George,

27:30.806 --> 27:32.028
I don't care.

27:32.622 --> 27:34.641
- You don't care?
- No.

27:34.669 --> 27:36.666
You did what you had to
do to get what you wanted.

27:36.831 --> 27:40.528
Next time, save yourself
the trouble and just tell me.

27:41.271 --> 27:43.647
So, you're not upset that I lied?

27:43.767 --> 27:46.660
How naive do you think
I am? Everyone lies.

27:47.581 --> 27:49.661
So. Who do we have money on?

27:49.892 --> 27:52.340
- Well, I just...
- Come on! It's starting.

27:52.390 --> 27:54.117
We don't want to miss it.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.435
The letter.

28:14.446 --> 28:17.609
The one written by Mildred
Preston to Mrs. Palmer.

28:17.675 --> 28:21.080
It said, "We're in control.
You'll never be able to stop us."

28:21.114 --> 28:22.445
They were talking about gambling.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.073
The victim knew what they were up to.

28:24.193 --> 28:27.119
Yes. And they killed her to
keep her from exposing them.

28:30.939 --> 28:33.299
William, Inspector.

28:44.906 --> 28:47.740
Careful!

28:50.413 --> 28:52.178
Faster, Rebecca!

29:00.231 --> 29:03.939
- Well done, Miss James, well done.
- Alright, Miss James, alright.

29:10.369 --> 29:14.280
That's not fair!

29:16.096 --> 29:18.220
I hope she's alright.

29:20.585 --> 29:22.942
You see?

29:22.976 --> 29:25.498
Once they fix the race,
they ensure they get the win.

29:25.536 --> 29:27.495
It's always about the money, Murdoch.

29:30.119 --> 29:31.650
Rebecca!

29:32.320 --> 29:33.853
Are you alright?

29:34.526 --> 29:36.121
Julia...

29:37.018 --> 29:39.290
- You did that on purpose!
- Excuse me!

29:39.317 --> 29:41.892
- All of you should be ashamed of yourselves.
- Julia! Let's go.

29:41.895 --> 29:44.609
- William, did you see what they did to her?
- I did.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.532
I'm aware that your
races involve betting.

29:58.866 --> 30:00.753
You ARE a clever man.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.439
Who cares? Anyone can see that.

30:04.439 --> 30:06.376
Please, put that down.

30:09.296 --> 30:13.972
I suspect that you all bet on
the eventual winner of the races,

30:14.137 --> 30:15.651
in this case Mildred,

30:16.360 --> 30:19.556
and then all work together
to ensure that result.

30:19.793 --> 30:22.592
- Is that against the law, Detective?
- No,

30:23.169 --> 30:25.750
but it does provide you
with sufficient motivation

30:25.761 --> 30:28.297
to have injured Sophie
Palmer prior to the race.

30:28.332 --> 30:31.191
We were all in the arena at the
time that Sophie was attacked.

30:31.356 --> 30:33.072
Even our bookie will tell you that.

30:33.094 --> 30:35.267
Well, I hope so, for your sake.

30:35.606 --> 30:38.023
My constable is speaking with him now.

30:40.807 --> 30:43.508
- Bye!
- Miss James.

30:43.794 --> 30:47.283
- I want to throttle each one of them.
- Composure, young lady.

30:47.317 --> 30:49.025
I want satisfaction.

30:49.319 --> 30:51.220
My ankle is well
enough to skate tonight.

30:51.255 --> 30:52.743
But not well enough to win.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.808
If you want to win, we need
to play them at their own game.

30:56.616 --> 30:57.541
"We?"

30:57.547 --> 30:59.862
Well, I am an Olympic
gold medal-winning coach.

31:00.028 --> 31:01.864
I might just be able
to help, Miss James.

31:01.899 --> 31:03.158
Very well.

31:03.555 --> 31:05.117
What do we need to do?

31:05.133 --> 31:06.492
We need to assemble a team

31:06.514 --> 31:08.913
that are willing to mix it
up even more than the Queens.

31:09.150 --> 31:11.901
- I can play dirty.
- Good, good.

31:12.259 --> 31:13.640
But we need a team.

31:14.179 --> 31:16.077
Do you know anyone else who can skate?

31:16.407 --> 31:20.462
- I just might.
- Sir, I spoke to the bookie.

31:20.489 --> 31:23.048
He says that the Queens were
indeed with him at the time

31:23.053 --> 31:25.469
Sophie Palmer was attacked.
That's if he can be trusted;

31:25.489 --> 31:26.721
he is a bookie after all.

31:26.743 --> 31:28.063
Although I hope he can be...

31:28.079 --> 31:29.394
I've placed some
hard-earned money with him.

31:29.426 --> 31:32.563
A bookmaker's living necessitates
his trustworthiness, George.

31:32.579 --> 31:35.363
- I'm sure he'll be fine. Thank you.
- Oh, one other thing I found, sir.

31:35.373 --> 31:37.788
He said that Herschel
Humphries, the fiancÃ©,

31:37.854 --> 31:39.902
placed the largest
single bet of the day.

31:40.451 --> 31:42.888
- Oh?
- More interestingly,

31:43.008 --> 31:44.895
he bet on the field

31:44.917 --> 31:46.524
to beat Sophie Palmer.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.845
He bet against his own fiancÃ©e,

31:49.049 --> 31:51.310
who recently became unable to skate?

31:51.882 --> 31:54.317
Almost as if he knew what
was going to happen to her.

31:59.122 --> 32:01.025
Lace 'em up, Doctor.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.660
Come in.

32:04.903 --> 32:06.744
Oh. Ah.

32:07.098 --> 32:08.204
Ah!

32:08.963 --> 32:10.921
Duty calls, Miss Bloom.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.935
Where would I find your friend?

32:21.765 --> 32:23.168
Gentlemen.

32:23.619 --> 32:25.919
I'm afraid you'll have to
finish your painting later.

32:26.039 --> 32:28.053
Young lady, you're coming with me.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.107
I apologize for your disappointment.

32:36.409 --> 32:39.629
No, no, no, no. We
are going to pursue...

32:39.663 --> 32:42.244
I've invented a diamond formation

32:42.245 --> 32:43.945
that I used at the Olympics,

32:44.006 --> 32:46.969
called the diamond formation. A diamond.

32:47.004 --> 32:49.897
Your two wide players
block from the wings,

32:49.958 --> 32:52.049
while your back player zooms through.

32:52.049 --> 32:54.305
That makes no sense. This
is a football formation.

32:54.327 --> 32:56.153
- We are on roller skates.
- It's the same principle

32:56.164 --> 32:58.997
- with a ball or without a ball.
- We won't be able to do it until the third cycle.

32:59.025 --> 33:01.231
- The third cycle?
- The third way around.

33:01.264 --> 33:03.651
- There's no point in starting this...
- Miss James, Miss James...

33:03.687 --> 33:05.318
Ahem!

33:06.622 --> 33:08.624
It looks like you could use my help.

33:14.127 --> 33:17.197
Unfortunately, I have
to work this evening.

33:17.234 --> 33:20.299
I was looking forward to
a quiet night in with you.

33:20.822 --> 33:23.272
Oh that's fine, William.

33:23.649 --> 33:27.142
I may be meeting with some lady
friends this evening anyhow.

33:28.825 --> 33:29.861
Well,

33:29.981 --> 33:32.748
I hope you have a wonderful time then.

33:33.689 --> 33:35.151
We will.

33:43.173 --> 33:44.746
Mr. Humphries.

33:46.094 --> 33:47.496
What is it?

33:47.766 --> 33:49.703
It's come to my attention that you've

33:49.714 --> 33:53.372
- placed a significant bet on the race.
- What of it?

33:53.405 --> 33:57.690
And that you effectively bet against
your own fiancÃ©e, Sophie Palmer.

33:57.872 --> 33:59.687
Congratulations, Detective.

33:59.857 --> 34:01.903
- You admit to this?
- I do.

34:01.936 --> 34:04.566
Well then, that provides
you with enough motivation

34:04.566 --> 34:07.855
to have injured Miss
Palmer prior to the race.

34:07.893 --> 34:09.588
Do you as readily admit to that?

34:10.088 --> 34:11.623
She deserved it.

34:11.860 --> 34:14.793
Well, then you are under
arrest, Mr. Humphries.

34:15.128 --> 34:18.940
- Would you care to explain yourself?
- She's not my fiancÃ©e anymore.

34:19.297 --> 34:20.971
She's broken off the engagement?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.813
Apparently her mother
was the only reason

34:22.830 --> 34:24.388
we were together in the first place.

34:24.507 --> 34:26.862
Sophie and her father both hate me.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.178
Do they?

34:28.297 --> 34:29.719
The moment her mother was dead,

34:29.741 --> 34:31.942
Sophie dropped me like a sack of coal.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.967
If I didn't know any better, I
would think that Sophie herself

34:35.001 --> 34:37.608
killed her mother just to
get out of the engagement.

34:38.351 --> 34:40.116
"If you didn't know any better?"

34:41.289 --> 34:43.869
I was with Sophie the night
her mother was murdered.

34:45.101 --> 34:46.614
It couldn't have been her.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.880
You were with Sophie that night?

34:54.425 --> 34:55.955
Mr. Palmer.

34:56.708 --> 34:59.444
You and your daughter both
told me that you were together

34:59.477 --> 35:01.028
the night of your wife's death,

35:01.205 --> 35:04.131
but I've since learned
otherwise from Mr. Humphries.

35:04.395 --> 35:07.910
In fact, he told me he and
Sophie were together that night.

35:07.944 --> 35:09.995
Your daughter covered for you.

35:15.365 --> 35:17.482
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

35:17.812 --> 35:19.199
How so?

35:19.732 --> 35:22.258
Lea and I were out
skating the boardwalk.

35:22.292 --> 35:25.646
As usual, she began planning
out her daughter's life.

35:25.766 --> 35:28.650
I had to stand up for
Sophie, and myself.

35:28.815 --> 35:31.340
- What happened?
- We began arguing.

35:31.401 --> 35:34.336
I wanted her to let Sophie
pursue her passion again.

35:34.371 --> 35:36.103
The roller racing?

35:36.223 --> 35:39.981
But most of all, I wanted her
to stop being so domineering

35:40.101 --> 35:42.980
with the both of us. She was
forcing Sophie to marry Herschel.

35:43.013 --> 35:44.613
She didn't want to.

35:45.087 --> 35:49.044
So you pushed your wife off the
boardwalk to free your daughter.

35:49.164 --> 35:51.904
We began to struggle, I...

35:53.163 --> 35:57.259
pushed her, but I didn't
think she would fall and die.

35:57.970 --> 35:59.902
Did Sophie have a hand in it as well?

35:59.944 --> 36:03.114
No. Absolutely not. I told
her the next day what happened,

36:03.116 --> 36:04.987
after you'd already spoken with her.

36:05.107 --> 36:07.184
She insisted on providing my alibi.

36:07.226 --> 36:09.498
I was prepared to turn myself in.

36:09.762 --> 36:11.605
I still am, so long as

36:11.660 --> 36:14.273
Herschel gets his due
for crippling Sophie.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.736
He will.

36:16.968 --> 36:22.289
Mr. Palmer, you are under arrest
for the murder of Lea Palmer.

36:23.339 --> 36:26.425
May I watch one last race, Detective?

36:32.422 --> 36:33.729
Julia?

36:34.067 --> 36:35.553
Right, ladies, remember:

36:35.773 --> 36:38.968
Don't let them get under your skin,
but don't hesitate to get under theirs.

36:39.088 --> 36:41.376
And remember to get out
early and block the Queens

36:41.398 --> 36:43.769
- before they can block you.
- And ladies,

36:43.830 --> 36:46.085
if you get a chance to knock
one of them off the track,

36:46.143 --> 36:48.007
that will really throw
the cat amongst the pigeons

36:48.024 --> 36:50.674
- and bullocks their plan up.
- Cat amongst... ?

36:51.326 --> 36:54.350
- I'll relish it, Inspector.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

36:54.470 --> 36:56.528
If everyone does their job, it will.

36:56.832 --> 36:58.420
Good luck, ladies.

37:01.167 --> 37:02.936
One more thing, ladies.

37:05.810 --> 37:09.670
One, two, three!

37:24.369 --> 37:27.168
On your mark! Get set!

37:27.639 --> 37:28.779
Go!

37:36.426 --> 37:37.741
Watch out!

38:13.267 --> 38:15.010
Let go of me!

38:26.493 --> 38:28.249
Go, Julia!

39:20.933 --> 39:22.438
Yes, Rebecca!

39:35.512 --> 39:37.879
Yes! Ha!

39:44.705 --> 39:46.267
Julia, you did it!

39:57.318 --> 40:00.817
Well, I was left with little
choice but to appeal directly

40:00.839 --> 40:03.638
- to the city for the necessary funding.
- You did so in person?

40:03.691 --> 40:06.120
Face to face is the
only way of convincing

40:06.146 --> 40:09.306
these dastardly bureaucrats
to give you anything.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.181
Oh Julia, you do make me laugh.

40:12.215 --> 40:14.865
They're not ALL bureaucrats, Julia.

40:14.882 --> 40:17.122
Philip Nemeth for instance
is quite considerate,

40:17.289 --> 40:19.767
- and certainly not dastardly.
- Oh shush, William.

40:19.802 --> 40:21.686
- You're ruining my story.
- Thank you, sir.

40:21.725 --> 40:23.727
Uh-uh. No sirs here, George.

40:23.740 --> 40:26.979
It's William when you
and Louise are our guests.

40:27.099 --> 40:28.890
Please do continue your story, Julia.

40:28.898 --> 40:30.734
Did you manage to secure your funding?

40:30.747 --> 40:33.688
I certainly did. And to
this day, my morgue boasts

40:33.696 --> 40:37.173
of the finest collections of
post-mortem texts in all of Canada.

40:37.293 --> 40:38.202
Yes.

40:38.422 --> 40:40.790
I should love to see your
morgue one day, Julia.

40:40.825 --> 40:43.748
Although I lent the previous
coroner one of my finer texts

40:43.748 --> 40:45.571
and I never saw it again.

40:47.366 --> 40:50.122
I do love that you've
chosen to live in a hotel.

40:50.456 --> 40:51.803
How romantic.

40:52.098 --> 40:54.655
Well, we did consider building...

40:54.694 --> 40:56.274
Oh? What prevented you?

40:57.220 --> 40:58.505
Well...

40:58.818 --> 41:02.563
We found several
corpses on the property.

41:02.632 --> 41:04.570
Three of them.

41:06.365 --> 41:08.724
- Sir?
- Ah, George,

41:08.844 --> 41:11.073
that is a tea-bag.

41:11.285 --> 41:12.368
A tea-bag?

41:12.407 --> 41:14.969
A recent invention of a
New York City merchant.

41:15.013 --> 41:16.346
He originally intended

41:16.466 --> 41:19.415
for the tea to be removed
and brewed traditionally,

41:19.449 --> 41:21.363
but I have discovered that it is

41:21.390 --> 41:24.537
far more efficient to steep the tea

41:24.594 --> 41:26.770
inside the perforated bag.

41:27.723 --> 41:30.258
A tea-bag. Now I've seen everything.

41:31.213 --> 41:33.065
You're so knowledgeable, Detective.

41:33.185 --> 41:35.762
Oh, I assure you I'm not.

41:36.260 --> 41:39.701
I understand you also know
a great deal about batteries?

41:40.744 --> 41:42.765
The detective is a veritable
expert on the matter.

41:42.885 --> 41:45.789
Well, then I shall love
to hear what he has to say.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.047
Battery stories.

41:48.478 --> 41:50.093
Mostly positive, actually.

41:52.749 --> 41:54.463
Look at those stars.

41:55.656 --> 41:56.914
What a wonderful night.

41:57.346 --> 41:58.684
Wonderful indeed.

41:59.014 --> 42:01.509
Certainly more illuminating
than those awful bores.

42:02.478 --> 42:03.525
Bores?

42:03.560 --> 42:04.687
The Murdochs.

42:05.598 --> 42:06.681
The Murdochs?

42:06.763 --> 42:10.743
They spent all night prattling
on about medical textbooks,

42:10.778 --> 42:12.873
tea-sacks, and batteries.

42:13.252 --> 42:14.735
And to live in a hotel?

42:15.541 --> 42:17.339
What a sad little existence.

42:20.993 --> 42:22.744
I thought you quite enjoyed yourself?

42:22.779 --> 42:23.968
Good heavens, no.

42:24.518 --> 42:26.781
Promise me that however
old we grow together,

42:26.783 --> 42:28.299
we will never become like them.

42:29.439 --> 42:30.702
I promise.

42:31.217 --> 42:32.573
But he is your boss.

42:32.921 --> 42:34.131
We did our duty.

42:34.866 --> 42:38.894
I look forward to introducing you
to more appropriate friends, George.

42:51.885 --> 42:55.784
I suppose we can now find out
who truly is the better skater.

42:55.904 --> 42:59.219
Are you sure your ankle is
healed sufficiently, Rebecca?

42:59.253 --> 43:01.615
Think you can win without my help?

43:02.248 --> 43:05.782
I do believe that this
trophy shall remain mine.

43:05.823 --> 43:08.388
Only one way to find out.

43:13.497 --> 43:15.739
- Ready?
- Set.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.485
Go!

43:17.973 --> 43:22.505
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

43:22.560 --> 43:25.150
Next Monday, Murdoch is on the run.

43:25.151 --> 43:27.992
- Murdoch didn't kill anyone.
- It is what the evidence says.

43:28.013 --> 43:29.532
Caught in a conspiracy.

43:29.548 --> 43:32.346
I don't think anyone in the
Constabulary can help me.

43:32.346 --> 43:34.883
With a target on his back.
