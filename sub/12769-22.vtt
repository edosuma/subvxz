FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD.

03:49.041 --> 03:51.709
THEY'RE SUSPENDING

WE'RE BEING INVESTIGATED.
I'M SORRY. I NEVER MEANT
FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

04:02.083 --> 04:06.000
YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.
THE POINT IS, THE MEDICAL BOARD
THINKS SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG,

04:06.041 --> 04:08.875
WHICH MEANS THEY MIGHT THINK
WE ALL HAVE.
LET'S NOT OVERREACT--

04:08.917 --> 04:10.875
OH, COME ON, PETE.
WE'RE UNDER INVESTIGATION.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.041
ONCE THEY START
DIGGING AROUND--
FACE IT. WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.834
I MEAN, WHAT, WE SHARE
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

04:15.875 --> 04:19.041
WE LIE TO OUR PATIENTS
FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.

04:19.083 --> 04:22.041
WE PUSHED THE LINE SO FAR BACK,
IT ISN'T EVEN A LINE ANYMORE.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.041
WE'RE NOT DOCTORS. WE'RE
FRIGGIN' COWBOYS WITH GUNS.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.041
NO. WE REFUSE TO FOLLOW RULES
MADE UP BY PEOPLE

04:26.083 --> 04:28.834
THAT DON'T TAKE THE CASES
THAT WE DO--THE HARD CASES.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.834
WE REFUSE TO LET THEM DETERMINE
THE COURSE OF PEOPLE'S LIVES.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.041

EVERY NOW AND THEN, BIG DEAL.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.500
IT'S FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THE PATIENT.
THIS ISN'T HELPING.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.750
THE--THE ORIGINAL IDEA
OF OCEANSIDE WELLNESS WAS

04:38.792 --> 04:40.959
DOCTORS WORKING COOPERATIVELY
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

04:41.000 --> 04:44.500
TO HELP THEIR PATIENTS--SHARING
IDEAS AND DEBATING CASES.

04:44.542 --> 04:48.041
IT'S NOT WRONG. THIS WORKS.
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
OF WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS.

04:48.083 --> 04:51.041
(Sam) THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE
WILLING TO FIGHT TO PROTECT IT?

04:51.083 --> 04:55.041
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD.
AM I WRONG?

04:55.083 --> 04:57.041
(buzzes)

04:57.083 --> 04:59.000
AN EMERGENCY
AT THE HOSPITAL.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.375

05:05.875 --> 05:07.542
YOU OKAY?

05:12.083 --> 05:13.917

05:21.083 --> 05:23.041

05:23.083 --> 05:25.792
32-YEAR-OLD CAUCASIAN FEMALE,
SUSTAINED BLUNT TRAUMA

05:25.834 --> 05:28.166
AND POSSIBLE KIDNEY INJURY
FROM A SEXUAL ASSAULT.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.166
I CAN GET ANOTHER DOCTOR
TO LOOK AT HER, IT'S JUST THAT

05:31.208 --> 05:33.792
YOU WERE SIGNED UP WITH
THE RAPE CRISIS TEAM AND--

05:33.834 --> 05:35.417
WHAT'S HER NAME?
KAITLIN MILLS.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.041
(curtain rings clatter)

05:37.083 --> 05:38.834

05:46.125 --> 05:48.208

05:48.250 --> 05:50.083

05:50.125 --> 05:53.041

BUT I CAN'T.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.625

06:08.083 --> 06:11.041
UH... THERE'S BLOOD
IN YOUR URINE...

06:11.083 --> 06:14.250
(clears throat) WHICH MEANS
THERE'S POSSIBLE KIDNEY DAMAGE.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.125
WE NEED TO GET A SCAN.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.458
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY HERE
A FEW DAYS FOR OBSERVATION.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.041
I NEED TO DO A PELVIC EXAM.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.250

A RAPE KIT.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.250

06:26.291 --> 06:28.291
(voice breaking)
YOU DON'T KNOW.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.917
DON'T STAND THERE

PRACTICED DOCTOR COMPASSION,

06:32.959 --> 06:37.083
L-LIKE YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.917
I'M NOT GONNA LAY HERE
AND... (sniffles)

06:39.959 --> 06:43.041
LET YOU--NO.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.083
(beeping continues)

06:45.125 --> 06:47.583
NO RAPE KIT.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.250
OF COURSE.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.375
NO RAPE KIT.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.709
LET'S JUST GET YOU ADMITTED.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.083

06:57.125 --> 06:59.250
(curtain rings clatter)

06:59.291 --> 07:01.083
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:01.125 --> 07:04.041
ROUTINE EXAMINATION.
SHE STARTED SEIZING.
EPILEPTIC?

07:04.083 --> 07:06.500
JUVENILE KRABBE'S DISEASE.
SHE ALREADY HAD

07:06.542 --> 07:09.417
MARKED DETERIORATION
OF HER NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEM.
MARISA, MOMMY'S HERE, OKAY?

07:09.458 --> 07:12.333
MOMMY'S HERE.
THIS IS OUR FAULT. WE REDUCED
HER MEDS THIS MONTH.

07:12.375 --> 07:15.250
THE SEDATIVES
WERE MAKING HER A ZOMBIE.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.333
OKAY, LORAZEPAM'S ON BOARD.
PHENYTOIN GOING IN.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.125
LET'S TURN HER.
GET HER OVER.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.083
(beeping normalizes)
OH, WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.041
SHE'S BREATHING AGAIN.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.542
OH, THANK GOD.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.500
SHE GONNA BE OKAY?
FOR NOW.

07:27.542 --> 07:30.041
(Cooper) SHE WAS HEALTHY
UNTIL ABOUT THE AGE OF 3.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.417
UM, SHE'S LOST MOST OF HEARING,
PART OF HER VISION,

07:32.458 --> 07:34.417
AND SHE'S SLOWLY LOSING
THE ABILITY

07:34.458 --> 07:36.458
TO CONTROL HER OWN MOVEMENTS.
PROGNOSIS?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.875
SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO HELP THEM TO ADJUST,

07:38.917 --> 07:41.041
BUT HOW DO YOU
GET SOMEONE TO ACCEPT

07:41.083 --> 07:44.083
THAT A DISEASE
IS KILLING THEIR CHILD?
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER READING
ABOUT A CASE LIKE THIS.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.709
HAVEN'T THEY HAD SOME SUCCESS

07:45.750 --> 07:47.083
TRANSFUSING HEMATOPOIETIC
STEM CELLS

07:47.125 --> 07:49.083
TO SLOW THE PROGRESS
OF THE DISEASE?

07:49.125 --> 07:51.500
YEAH, I READ THAT, TOO,
THE PROBLEM IS, IT HAS NEVER

07:51.542 --> 07:53.959
BEEN USED ON SOMEONE WHOSE
ILLNESS IS THIS FAR ADVANCED.
EVEN SO,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.458
IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT
WE COULD BUY HER SOME REAL TIME,

07:56.500 --> 07:59.959
WHERE SHE'S NOT GETTING WORSE,
ISN'T THAT WORTH A SHOT?
IT COULD EXACERBATE THE DAMAGE
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.959
THAT WOULD GIVE MARISA
EVEN LESS TIME.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.083
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

08:05.125 --> 08:07.041
POOR VIOLET.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.083
(indistinct conversations)

08:09.125 --> 08:12.041
POOR US.
GOD. CAN'T YOU BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING?

08:12.083 --> 08:14.083
IT'LL ALL END UP FINE,
RIGHT?

08:14.125 --> 08:17.709
I MEAN, THE WORST HAS
ALREADY HAPPENED, HASN'T IT?
I HOPE SO.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.417
FIFE IS LEAVING.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.834
YEAH?

08:20.875 --> 08:23.834
WITHOUT ME, WHICH IS...
WHICH IS HOW IT HAS TO BE.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.834
I MEAN, I CAN'T GO WITH HIM.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.917
I... I HAVE BETSEY,

08:27.959 --> 08:29.500
AND SHE NEEDS ME.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.041
I NEED TO DEVOTE ALL MY TIME
TO HER, RIGHT?

08:32.083 --> 08:33.709
I DON'T THINK I'M QUALIFIED

08:33.750 --> 08:35.709
TO GIVE ADVICE
ON RELATIONSHIPS.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.041
I MEAN, AFTER SAM? YOU KNOW,
I WAS IN THE GROCERY STORE.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.041
I TRIED FLIRTING WITH THIS GUY
THE OTHER DAY,

08:40.083 --> 08:43.041
AND THE BEST I COULD
COME UP WITH WAS...
(elevator bell dings)

08:43.083 --> 08:45.792
"HOW DO YOU TELL
IF THESE THINGS ARE RIPE?"

08:45.834 --> 08:48.458
LIKE SOME KIND OF FREAK OR--
DR. MONTGOMERY, NEAL CHAPLIN
FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.542
WE SPOKE--
YES, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
THIS IS THE GUY

08:50.583 --> 08:54.250
WHO INTERVIEWED ME WHEN VIOLET
WAS BEING INVESTIGATED.
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

08:54.291 --> 08:56.250
AS PART OF THE MEDICAL BOARD'S
INVESTIGATION

08:56.291 --> 08:58.959
INTO THIS PRACTICE, I'M GOING TO
NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH

08:59.000 --> 09:01.875
EACH OF THE DOCTORS HERE AND DO
A COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW.
WAIT.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.667
DO WE HAVE TO
TALK TO THIS GUY?
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:04.709 --> 09:07.041
YOU COULD CALL YOUR LAWYERS,
CONSULT, AND THEN WE COULD

09:07.083 --> 09:09.959
START THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP
TIMES WHICH ARE CONVENIENT

09:10.000 --> 09:12.250
FOR THEM AND FOR ME
AND FOR ALL OF YOU.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.250
THAT COULD BE
EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.875
PLEASE DON'T COME INTO
OUR OFFICE AND THREATEN US.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.291
I HAVE A JOB TO DO,
BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO START

09:19.333 --> 09:22.041
BY SENDING IN A TEAM
TO COPY ALL OF YOUR FILES.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.083
AND JUDGING
BY WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN

09:24.125 --> 09:26.875
FROM OUR REVIEW
OF DR. TURNER'S RECORDS, UH,

09:26.917 --> 09:28.875
WE SHOULD HAVE PLENTY
TO WORK WITH.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.875
OKAY, UH, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, MR. CHAPLIN,

09:30.917 --> 09:34.458
YOU NEED TO TURN AROUND AND GET
THE HELL OUT OF OUR OFFICE.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.041
SAM, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL
THE INVESTIGATOR OFF.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.875
YOU THINK THAT HELPED?
LOOK, HE CAME IN HERE,
INTO OUR OFFICE,

09:50.917 --> 09:52.875
AND TRIED TO PUSH US AROUND.
Y-YES, IT HELPS US.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.083
WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO
TALK TO HIM.
ALL YOU DID
WAS MAKE HIM MAD, SAM.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.542
NEITHER ONE OF YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.959
THAT MAN IS A SHARK,
AND HE IS CIRCLING US.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.417
IF WE GIVE UP, THEN THAT--THAT'S
BLOOD IN THE WATER. WE'RE DEAD.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.291
WE MAY BE DEAD ANYWAY.
NO, WE NEED TO FIGHT.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.959
WE NEED TO STAND UP
AND FIGHT FOR THIS PRACTICE.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.333
HOW COME NOBODY WANTS
TO FIGHT FOR THE...
WE COULD CALL OUR LAWYERS,
GET THEIR ADVICE.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.125
YES, BUT WHATEVER THEY SAY,
WE DO,

10:14.166 --> 10:17.166
EVEN IF THEY TELL US
NOT TO FIGHT.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.125
(indistinct conversations)

10:22.166 --> 10:24.333
(sighs) I COULD USE
AN A.A. MEETING.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.000
WANT TO JOIN ME?

10:26.041 --> 10:28.375
I'M WAITING ON A MOTORCYCLIST
TOO COOL FOR A HELMET.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.375
OH.
WHAT ABOUT AFTER WORK?

10:30.417 --> 10:33.458
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.
I'LL GO WITH YOU TOMORROW,
OKAY?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.792
LIKE YOU WERE GONNA
GO WITH ME YESTERDAY?

10:35.834 --> 10:37.792
YOU'VE HAD
A LOT OF EXCUSES LATELY.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.792
CHARLOTTE, I HAVE A MOTHER,
A GOOD MOTHER.

10:39.834 --> 10:42.041
LET HER DO HER JOB.
(siren wailing)

10:42.083 --> 10:44.667
LET'S GO TO A MEETING
TOMORROW MORNING ON MONTANA.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.375
(siren whoops)

10:46.417 --> 10:47.500
(sighs)

10:47.542 --> 10:49.000
(engine idles)

10:51.000 --> 10:53.125
SHE DOES IT SO FAST,

10:53.166 --> 10:57.041
SOMETIMES I CAN'T EVEN
KEEP UP. (chuckles)

10:57.083 --> 10:59.041
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU KNEW SIGN LANGUAGE.

10:59.083 --> 11:02.709
IT HELPS TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT
FOR MY DEAF PATIENTS.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.000
OH, HA HA HA HA.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.375
SO THIS, UM, P-PROCEDURE,

11:07.417 --> 11:10.709
HOW MUCH MORE TIME
WOULD IT GIVE MARISA?

11:10.750 --> 11:12.709
WELL, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO SAY.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.041
BUT STUDIES SUGGEST
THAT IT COULD GIVE HER

11:16.083 --> 11:18.709
AN EXTRA TWO OR THREE YEARS.
TH-THAT'S AMAZING.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.333
THAT'S AMAZING.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.917
DIDN'T YOU HEAR THEM?

11:24.959 --> 11:26.917
I HEARD THEM,
BUT THEY ALSO SAID

11:26.959 --> 11:29.083
THAT THEY WEREN'T SURE
IT WOULD WORK

11:29.125 --> 11:31.041
AND THAT
IT COULD MAKE HER WORSE.

11:31.083 --> 11:35.625
THE IDEA OF MORE TIME
WITH HER... JASON--

11:35.667 --> 11:38.208
IF THIS WERE YOUR CHILD,
DR. WILDER,

11:38.250 --> 11:41.041
WOULD YOU RISK THE TIME YOU KNEW
YOU HAD LEFT WITH HER?

11:41.083 --> 11:43.041
WELL, THIS IS
A VERY PERSONAL DECISION,

11:43.083 --> 11:45.041
AND IT'S REALLY NOT RELEVANT
WHAT DR. WILDER

11:45.083 --> 11:46.417
OR ANYBODY ELSE WOULD DO.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.875
IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW PREPARED
YOUR FAMILY IS EMOTIONALLY

11:48.917 --> 11:52.041
TO DEAL WITH THE OUTCOME OF
THIS, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.041
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
SHE WANTS TO KNOW

11:54.083 --> 11:56.417
WHEN SHE CAN GO HOME
AND SLEEP IN HER OWN BED.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.000
(indistinct conversations)

12:06.083 --> 12:08.000
(laughs)

12:09.834 --> 12:11.792
DO YOU COME HERE EVERY NIGHT?

12:11.834 --> 12:13.792
I COULDN'T GET THE IDEA
OF FRESH PINEAPPLE

12:13.834 --> 12:15.291
OUT OF MY MIND.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.041
(laughs)
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

12:17.083 --> 12:20.291
DO YOU--DO YOU COME HERE
EVERY NIGHT?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.041
NO.

12:22.083 --> 12:25.083
I LIED.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.000
(whispers)
I HATE PINEAPPLES.
(laughs)

12:30.083 --> 12:32.041
SO...

12:32.083 --> 12:33.500
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

12:33.542 --> 12:37.625
WELL, I...

12:37.667 --> 12:40.041
LET'S NOT.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.041
OH. OKAY.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.500
NO. I MEAN--

12:44.542 --> 12:47.041
LOOK, I-I COULD TELL YOU
ABOUT MY EX-BOYFRIEND,

12:47.083 --> 12:49.500
MY DATING HISTORY,
WHAT'S GOING ON AT WORK.

12:49.542 --> 12:52.917
I COULD TELL YOU
ALL OF THAT, BUT...

12:52.959 --> 12:54.333
LET'S MAKE A CHANGE.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.125
YOU WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE?

12:56.166 --> 12:59.667
YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO DO ANY OF
THE THINGS THAT I USUALLY DO--

12:59.709 --> 13:01.667
NO DRAMA, NO GAMES,
NO HISTORY.

13:01.709 --> 13:04.917
JUST YOU AND ME
IN THE PRESENT,

13:04.959 --> 13:06.875
START CLEAN.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.250
IS THAT WEIRD?

13:08.291 --> 13:11.166
NO. NOT AT ALL.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.875
OKAY.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.041
(laughs)

13:14.083 --> 13:16.583
(laughs) NO HISTORIES,
NO NAMES,

13:16.625 --> 13:19.000
JUST... HERE AND NOW.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.959
WHAT, IS THERE...
DO I HAVE SOME--

13:26.375 --> 13:30.709
I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT IT MIGHT
BE LIKE TO KISS THOSE LIPS.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.875
OH. (chuckles)

13:32.917 --> 13:35.667
OH, NO. WE CAN'T DO THAT.

13:35.709 --> 13:39.375
I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR NAME.
HEY, YOU SET THE RULES.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.458
YEAH, BUT WE'RE IN PUBLIC.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.125
WE'RE IN THE PRESENT.

14:14.208 --> 14:17.875
BEST DATE EVER, SO FAR.

14:17.917 --> 14:20.000
(chuckles)

14:23.083 --> 14:25.458
(all speaking indistinctly)

14:25.500 --> 14:28.041
MISSED YOU AT THE MEETING
THIS MORNING.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.667
YEAH, I WAS WIPED OUT
FROM BEING ON CALL.

14:30.709 --> 14:33.667
I HEARD IT WAS PRETTY SLOW
AT THE HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.959
OKAY, UM, WE JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH THE LAWYERS,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.667
AND THEY FELT STRONGLY
THAT WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE

14:39.709 --> 14:41.667
ABOUT PROTECTING OURSELVES
AS BEST WE CAN.

14:41.709 --> 14:44.333
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO START

14:44.375 --> 14:46.458
BY GOING BACK THROUGH
ALL OF OUR FILES,

14:46.500 --> 14:49.125
MAKING LISTS OF PATIENTS
WE CONSULTED EACH OTHER ABOUT,

14:49.166 --> 14:51.917
AND THEN WE NEED TO
SEPARATE OUT THE INSTANCES

14:51.959 --> 14:53.709
WHEN THE ADVICE WAS MEDICAL

14:53.750 --> 14:56.083
FROM THOSE WHERE WE JUST
DEBATED EACH OTHER FOR SPORT.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE DO.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.166
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.792
(Naomi) SAM, WE SAID WE WOULD
LISTEN TO THE LAWYERS.
(Cooper) AND THEN WHAT?

15:00.834 --> 15:03.041
WE'RE GONNA JUST SIT BACK
AND LET THEM PICK US APART?

15:03.083 --> 15:05.834
WELL, LOOK, WE PUSHED
BACK AS HARD AS WE COULD.
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

15:05.875 --> 15:09.208
THE PRACTICE IS ALREADY
A TARGET OF THE MEDICAL BOARD.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT TRUTH.

15:09.250 --> 15:12.041
THEY DON'T CARE THAT WE'RE
TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.667
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.041
THE LAWYERS GAVE US TWO CHOICES.
EITHER WE FIGURE OUT

15:16.083 --> 15:18.041
EVERY SINGLE POINT
OF VULNERABILITY NOW

15:18.083 --> 15:21.583
AND PREPARE
TO DEFEND OURSELVES.
OR?

15:21.625 --> 15:23.583
WE DISSOLVE THE PRACTICE,
GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS,

15:23.625 --> 15:26.041
AND HOPE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD
OR THE LAWYERS

15:26.083 --> 15:29.041
DON'T COME AFTER US
INDIVIDUALLY.

15:35.375 --> 15:37.041
HOW'S IT GOING?

15:37.083 --> 15:39.083
I'M DOING GOOD.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.500
GOOD.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.500
WELL, NOT EXACTLY GOOD,

15:42.542 --> 15:45.458
BECAUSE NOW I MAY NOT HAVE
A JOB TO GO TO,

15:45.500 --> 15:48.041
AND EVERYTHING IS A MESS,
BUT...

15:48.083 --> 15:50.500
I MET A GUY...

15:50.542 --> 15:53.542
OVER A PINEAPPLE.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.542
AND THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER?

15:55.583 --> 15:58.500
(Sara Swenson)
♪ SET A STILL FRAME IN MY MIND ♪

15:58.542 --> 16:01.583
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

16:01.625 --> 16:03.583

16:03.625 --> 16:05.250

16:12.750 --> 16:14.917
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

16:14.959 --> 16:18.083
WELL, APPARENTLY,
NONE OF US SHOULD BE.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.500
NO, I MEAN, I JUST...
I'M NOT EVEN A DOCTOR ANYMORE.

16:20.542 --> 16:22.083
YOU'RE STILL A DOCTOR.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.041
I CAN'T PRACTICE MEDICINE.
THAT'S NOT A DOCTOR. THAT'S...

16:25.083 --> 16:27.542
NOTHING. I'M NOTHING.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.000
COME ON. YOU'RE A WIFE.
YOU'RE A MOTHER.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.792
THAT...

16:31.834 --> 16:33.709
I HELP PEOPLE, PETE.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.291
IT'S WHO I AM.

16:35.333 --> 16:38.500
SO... YEAH, YEAH,
I GUESS I COULD LEARN

16:38.542 --> 16:41.083
TO BAKE BREAD
AND GO TO PLAYGROUPS

16:41.125 --> 16:43.917
AND LEARN HOW TO QUILT,

16:43.959 --> 16:46.917
AND I GUESS EVERYTHING
WOULD BE FINE FOR A WHILE,

16:46.959 --> 16:48.291
BUT THAT'S NOT ME.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.291
YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT ME, PETE.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.083
I... I WOULD GET SAD
AND DARK.

16:53.125 --> 16:55.500
AND WHY IS THAT
GOOD FOR LUCAS?

16:55.542 --> 16:58.125
(dramatic voice) DARK MOMMY
WITH A DRINK IN HER HAND.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.667
(normal voice) NO,
I'M JUST SAYING THAT...

17:00.709 --> 17:02.583
(laughs) MY IDENTITY
IS WHAT I DO.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.041
I NEED TO WORK TO FEEL ALIVE.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.667
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, VIOLET?

17:07.709 --> 17:10.250
MY PUBLISHER HAS BEEN AFTER ME
FOR A WHILE TO DO A BOOK TOUR.

17:10.291 --> 17:12.250
AND I THINK
I SHOULD DO THAT NOW.

17:12.291 --> 17:15.041
A BOOK TOUR?
THREE WEEKS.

17:15.083 --> 17:17.041
FOUR TOPS. I COULD
BRING LUCAS AND A NANNY.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.041
I COULD HELP PEOPLE
THROUGH MY BOOK.

17:19.083 --> 17:22.041
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YOU CAN'T JUST RUN AWAY
FROM YOUR PROBLEMS--

17:22.083 --> 17:24.041
I KNOW THAT, PETE.
I'M A SHRINK.

17:24.083 --> 17:27.041
OH, WAIT. I'M NOT ANYMORE,
WHICH IS THE POINT!

17:27.083 --> 17:29.041
JUST...

17:29.083 --> 17:32.000
THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

17:36.083 --> 17:38.834
(sighs)

17:38.875 --> 17:43.250
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:51.500 --> 17:53.458
A-A BOOK TOUR NOW?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

17:53.500 --> 17:57.041
I MEAN, SHE NEEDS TO STAY HERE
AND FIGHT THIS THING.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.375
MAN, YOU GOTTA GET HER
TO STAY AND FIGHT.
SHE'S UPSET. SHE'S DEVASTATED.

17:59.417 --> 18:01.709
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD FEEL
IF MY LICENSE WAS SUSPENDED,

18:01.750 --> 18:05.041
BUT THIS IS SUCH A BAD IDEA.
HOW DOES SHE NOT SEE THAT?
BECAUSE SHE'S VIOLET.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.041
ALL RIGHT.
STARTING THE CHEMO INFUSION.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.041
I MEAN, SHE BLAMES HERSELF

18:09.083 --> 18:12.333
FOR WHAT'S GOING ON
AT THE PRACTICE, BUT THAT--
(monitor beeping erratically)

18:12.375 --> 18:13.959
HER PRESSURE'S DROPPING.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.625
(beeping continues)

18:16.667 --> 18:19.041
MARISA HAD
A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION

18:19.083 --> 18:20.625
TO THE MEDICATION.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.625
WE WERE ABLE
TO RESUSCITATE HER,

18:22.667 --> 18:24.959
BUT... SHE WAS DEPRIVED
OF OXYGEN

18:25.000 --> 18:26.959
FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD
OF TIME.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.750
SHE MAY HAVE SUSTAINED
ADDITIONAL BRAIN DAMAGE.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.709
I'M VERY SORRY.
OH, GOD.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.291
I'M VERY SORRY.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.458
BUT SHE'S GOING TO
WAKE UP, RIGHT?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.875
SHE'S ONLY
MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL,

18:37.917 --> 18:40.041
AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET
ANY BETTER.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.625
NO.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.417
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

18:44.458 --> 18:48.041
THIS MORNING WE COULD TALK
TO HER, AND NOW...
(sobs)

18:48.083 --> 18:50.250
THE TWO OF YOU
PUSHED US TO DO THIS.

18:50.291 --> 18:53.250
NOW YOU TOOK MY GIRL FROM ME.
(crying)

18:53.291 --> 18:56.041
I'LL GO AFTER HIM.
NO, I WILL.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.917
(crying) OH.

18:57.959 --> 19:01.000
(motor whirring)
KINDA QUIET AROUND HERE.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.917
WHAT DID YOU DO TO
ALL THE, YOU KNOW, PATIENTS?

19:03.959 --> 19:05.667
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.041
I ALMOST DID.
I JUST THOUGHT...

19:08.083 --> 19:10.917
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ALL THE MUSHY THINGS AGAIN.

19:10.959 --> 19:14.041
BUT I'M TAKING ONE MORE SHOT.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.917
I AM LEAVING TOMORROW.
COME WITH ME.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.333
GABRIEL, I...

19:18.375 --> 19:20.125
THE PRACTICE
IS FALLING APART,

19:20.166 --> 19:22.041
AND I CAN'T UPROOT BETSEY

19:22.083 --> 19:24.083
BEFORE I'VE EVEN
GOTTEN HER SETTLED.

19:24.125 --> 19:27.125
YOU COULD. IF YOU WANTED TO,
YOU COULD.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.500
OKAY.

19:31.542 --> 19:34.041
NICE KNOWING YOU, NAOMI.

19:34.083 --> 19:38.000
(whirring)

19:41.083 --> 19:43.041
I'M NOT THE KIND OF MAN--

19:43.083 --> 19:45.041
I'VE NEVER TALKED
TO MY WIFE LIKE THAT,

19:45.083 --> 19:48.208
MUCH LESS THE DOCTORS TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF MY DAUGHTER.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.041
IT'S OKAY.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.125
NO, IT'S NOT.
NONE OF IT IS.

19:52.166 --> 19:55.417
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DROPPED
MY GUARD.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.792
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET MYSELF
IMAGINE A FUTURE

19:57.834 --> 19:59.792
WHERE I COULD TEACH MY GIRL

19:59.834 --> 20:02.041
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
AND HOW TO DRIVE A CAR.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.875
I WANT TO BLAME SOMEONE,

20:03.917 --> 20:06.250
BUT THAT
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.875
I CAN'T WATCH MY BABY
OR ANGELA SUFFER ANYMORE.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.458
I CAN'T.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.417
ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WAY,
A MORE HUMANE WAY TO TREAT HER?

20:14.458 --> 20:16.041
I'M SORRY, JASON.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.041
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR YOU,

20:19.083 --> 20:21.834
BUT WE'VE RUN OUT
OF MEDICAL OPTIONS.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.458
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.500
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME
END MARISA'S SUFFERING.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.667
(footsteps approach)

20:36.709 --> 20:39.709
SO I HAD COFFEE
WITH PINEAPPLE GUY.

20:39.750 --> 20:43.041
AND I KISSED HIM...

20:43.083 --> 20:46.458
WHICH I HAVE DECIDED
IS A GOOD THING.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.458
IT'S NEW, SO...

20:49.500 --> 20:51.458
RIGHT?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.667
WHAT?

20:52.709 --> 20:55.834
(mouth full) FIFE CAME BACK.

20:55.875 --> 20:59.250
AND HE ASKED ME TO GO AWAY
WITH HIM... AGAIN.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.041
AND YOU SAID?

21:01.083 --> 21:02.875
NO, AGAIN.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.458
YOU COULD GO.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.041
START FRESH.
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.041
I CAN'T.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.250
I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.083
I'M THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.041
I... I CAN'T LEAVE,

21:15.083 --> 21:17.041
NOT WITH THE PRACTICE
IN A MESS,

21:17.083 --> 21:20.041
AND I CAN'T ABANDON THE PRACTICE
AND I CAN'T ABANDON YOU GUYS--

21:20.083 --> 21:23.208
AND--AND MAYA. DID I TELL YOU
SHE GOT INTO COLUMBIA?

21:23.250 --> 21:24.625
WHAT?

21:24.667 --> 21:27.083
SHE GOT INTO COLUMBIA,
AND SHE WANTS TO GO.

21:27.125 --> 21:30.041
(normal voice) HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO HELP HER WITH THAT--

21:30.083 --> 21:32.041
GOING TO COLLEGE WITH A BABY--
AND BETSEY--

21:32.083 --> 21:34.959
I MEAN, I-I KNOW I OWE IT TO HER
TO GIVE HER THE STABILITY

21:35.000 --> 21:36.959
THAT POOR CHILD
HAS NEVER MANAGED TO HAVE.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.959
I MEAN, I--WHY CAN'T HE
UNDERSTAND THAT?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.333
WHY CAN'T HE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M
JUST TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE?

21:42.375 --> 21:44.542
(crunches)

21:44.583 --> 21:46.875
WHAT--WHAT'S...
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE

21:46.917 --> 21:49.250
WITH YOUR FACE?

21:49.291 --> 21:52.041
I'M JUST TRYING NOT TO CRY.
(candy clatters)

21:52.083 --> 21:54.875
OH. ALL RIGHT.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.542
(mouth full)
FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES...

21:57.583 --> 21:59.041
(sets box on table)

21:59.083 --> 22:01.041
I'M GONNA BE
THE RESPONSIBLE ONE,

22:01.083 --> 22:03.000
AND YOU GO AHEAD...

22:03.041 --> 22:04.792
AND CRY.

22:04.834 --> 22:07.291
(normal voice) GO AHEAD.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.500
IT'S OKAY.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.667
YOU CRY.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.166
I'M HERE.

22:24.041 --> 22:27.000
(waves crashing)

22:30.750 --> 22:32.500
HEY.

22:32.542 --> 22:36.083
SO THIS WHOLE THING THAT'S
GOING ON WITH THE PRACTICE...

22:36.125 --> 22:37.083
YEAH.

22:37.125 --> 22:38.709
RIGHT? I MEAN...

22:38.750 --> 22:41.667
I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY WE CAN WIN THIS.

22:41.709 --> 22:43.542
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT IT.

22:43.583 --> 22:45.542
DO YOU WANT TO GRAB DINNER
OR SOMETHING

22:45.583 --> 22:49.250
AND TRY TO FIGURE
THIS WHOLE THING OUT?
I HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.041
I HAVE A DATE.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.250
OH.

22:53.291 --> 22:54.875
OH. (laughs)

22:54.917 --> 22:56.375
I'M SORRY.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.375
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIE.
NO, IT'S FINE.
I TOTALLY--I GET IT.

22:59.417 --> 23:01.458
UH... (clears throat)
NO, GO. GO HAVE FUN.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.083
GO HAVE FUN ON YOUR DATE.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.834
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
FIGHT IT, SAM.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.917
MAYBE WE SHOULD
LET THE PRACTICE DIE

23:12.959 --> 23:15.000
AND JUST GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.792
(lock clicks)

23:22.834 --> 23:24.834
(jangles keys)

23:27.875 --> 23:30.041
(keys jangle)

23:30.083 --> 23:32.041
(bag clatters)

23:32.083 --> 23:33.917
I HAVE AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL

23:33.959 --> 23:36.291
WHO'S GONE FROM SMILING
AND SIGNING THIS MORNING

23:36.333 --> 23:38.667
TO A PERMANENT
VEGETATIVE STATE,

23:38.709 --> 23:41.542
AND HER FATHER WANTS ME TO...

23:43.500 --> 23:45.458
HE WANTS ME TO EUTHANIZE HER.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.500
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,
CHARLOTTE,

23:47.542 --> 23:49.333
I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING IT.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.917
(inhales deeply)
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS...

23:55.959 --> 23:59.083
(exhales) I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH A PATIENT WHO WAS RAPED.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.083
THEY BROUGHT HER IN

24:01.125 --> 24:03.959
LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE
THE WAY I FELT--

24:04.000 --> 24:06.875
JUST... WRECKED.

24:06.917 --> 24:09.250
I'M NOT LIKE VIOLET.

24:09.291 --> 24:12.041
I CAN'T SHARE EVERYTHING
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE

24:12.083 --> 24:13.625
WITH PEOPLE.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.625
I'M NEVER GONNA WRITE
A BOOK.

24:15.667 --> 24:17.625
THAT'S NOT HOW I'M BUILT.

24:17.667 --> 24:21.166
BUT HERE, EVEN THOUGH
I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING,

24:21.208 --> 24:23.709
KNEW I SHOULD...

24:23.750 --> 24:25.291
I COULDN'T.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.291
(voice breaks)
I JUST FOLDED UP.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.959
I'M SORRY.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.959
(normal voice) I DIDN'T TELL YOU
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.083
I TOLD YOU BECAUSE...
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

24:36.125 --> 24:39.083
I GUESS I'M LOOKING...

24:39.125 --> 24:41.709
FOR THE SAME THING
YOU ARE.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.500
WHAT'S THAT?

24:44.542 --> 24:46.041
(chuckles and sniffles)

24:46.083 --> 24:48.792
SOMEONE TO TELL ME
HOW HARD TO PUSH,

24:48.834 --> 24:51.333
HOW TO UNTANGLE
MY PATIENT'S BEST INTEREST

24:51.375 --> 24:53.792
FROM MY OWN.

24:56.750 --> 24:59.083
HOW DO WE DO THIS?

24:59.125 --> 25:01.917
I THINK...

25:01.959 --> 25:04.333
WE DO
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.959
WE PUT OUR PATIENT'S NEEDS
AHEAD OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS.

25:10.625 --> 25:12.917
YEAH.

25:12.959 --> 25:15.583
SO I'M GUESSING LAWYER.
I'M NOT A LAWYER.

25:15.625 --> 25:18.041
ANTHROPOLOGIST.
(laughs) THAT WOULD BE FUN,
BUT NO.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.000
AND STOP WITH THE 20 QUESTIONS.
I THOUGHT WE BOTH AGREED.

25:21.041 --> 25:23.750
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL
EACH OTHER WHO WE ARE

25:23.792 --> 25:26.166
SOONER OR LATER.
ON OUR NEXT DATE,
I PROMISE.

25:26.208 --> 25:29.000
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WAIT
TWO WHOLE WEEKS.
TWO--WHAT--TWO WEEKS?

25:29.041 --> 25:31.166
WE HAVE TO WAIT TWO WEEKS
FOR OUR NEXT DATE?

25:31.208 --> 25:33.166
I AM TAKING
A MUCH-DESERVED VACATION--

25:33.208 --> 25:34.875
14 DAYS IN FIJI...
(gasps)

25:34.917 --> 25:38.041
WHITE SAND, BLUE WATER.
OH, I'M JEALOUS.

25:38.083 --> 25:41.375
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE. BUT HEY,
I'LL BRING YOU BACK A GIFT.

25:41.417 --> 25:43.250
(both laugh)

25:43.291 --> 25:46.000
OR YOU COULD COME WITH ME.

25:47.417 --> 25:49.041
OH, RIGHT.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.667
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

25:50.709 --> 25:52.792
WE COULD SPEND OUR DAYS

25:52.834 --> 25:54.792
TELLING EACH OTHER
OUR LIFE STORIES.

25:54.834 --> 25:57.333
WE COULD SPEND OUR NIGHTS
HAVING--HAVING HOT SEX

25:57.375 --> 26:01.000
IN THIS AMAZING HUT
OUT OVER THE WATER.

26:01.041 --> 26:03.041
I CAN'T GO WITH YOU TO FIJI.
(laughs)

26:03.083 --> 26:06.041
WHY NOT? WHY NOT? WHAT DO YOU
HAVE HOLDING YOU HERE, HUH?

26:06.083 --> 26:09.041
YOU'RE TEMPTED.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.959
I KNOW YOU'RE TEMPTED.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.458
(door closes)
HEY.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.041
(jangles keys)
HEY. YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

26:18.083 --> 26:21.166
OH, I'VE FELT BETTER.
WHERE'S LUCAS?

26:21.208 --> 26:22.792
HE'S ALREADY SLEEPING.

26:22.834 --> 26:24.792
DO YOU--DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU SOMETHING?

26:24.834 --> 26:26.792
NO, I'M FINE.
I JUST... (sighs)

26:26.834 --> 26:29.041
I HAD A TOUGH A DAY.

26:29.083 --> 26:31.041
AND I KNOW
THAT WE HAVE TO FINISH

26:31.083 --> 26:33.875
TALKING ABOUT
THIS BOOK TOUR THING...

26:33.917 --> 26:35.041
YES.

26:35.083 --> 26:40.041
UM... I HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, AND...

26:40.083 --> 26:42.041
I-I NEED TO DO THIS.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.959
DOES IT MATTER
WHAT I THINK?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.959
OF COURSE IT MATTERS
WHAT YOU THINK.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.959
BUT I'M HOPING
THAT WHAT YOU'LL THINK IS,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.333
YOUR WIFE NEEDS THIS,
AND BECAUSE SHE NEEDS IT,

26:51.375 --> 26:53.041
YOU'LL SUPPORT HER.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.834
THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK.

26:54.875 --> 26:57.667
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK YOU'RE BEING SELFISH.

26:57.709 --> 27:00.750
OKAY.
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED.
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT LUCAS NEEDS.

27:00.792 --> 27:03.458
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT I NEED.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.
WELL, THIS BOOK
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.041
THIS BOOK IS TEARING
OUR PRACTICE APART.

27:06.083 --> 27:10.083
DO YOU WANT IT TO TEAR
OUR FAMILY APART, TOO?
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE BLAMING
THE BOOK... THE ONE THING--

27:10.125 --> 27:14.041
THE ONE GOOD THING THAT CAME
FROM KATIE SLICING ME OPEN--
LUCAS IS THE ONE GOOD THING--

27:14.083 --> 27:16.583
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.667
IT'S ONLY FOR THREE WEEKS,
AND LUCAS CAN COME WITH ME.
LUCAS IS NOT GOING.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.041
HE CAN STAY HERE IF THAT'S
EASIER FOR YOU. WE CAN MAKE

27:22.083 --> 27:25.291
THAT WORK, TOO. PETE, I DO NOT
WANT TO MAKE YOU UNHAPPY, BUT--
I SWEAR, VIOLET,
IF YOU RUN AWAY AGAIN--

27:25.333 --> 27:27.500
AGAIN?
YOU DROPPED LUCAS IN MY LAP
AND YOU RAN!

27:27.542 --> 27:31.917
BECAUSE I NEEDED TO!
OKAY, ONCE AGAIN...
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU!

27:31.959 --> 27:33.875
IF YOU RUN--

27:33.917 --> 27:35.250
JUST STOP IT, PETE.

27:35.291 --> 27:37.250
JUST STOP IT.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE,

27:37.291 --> 27:39.875
BECAUSE WHAT IS ABOUT TO COME
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH RIGHT NOW

27:39.917 --> 27:41.291
SOUNDS LIKE AN ULTIMATUM,

27:41.333 --> 27:43.291
AND I DO NOT RESPOND
TO ULTIMATUMS.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.917
AND THIS ISN'T THE PAST.

27:44.959 --> 27:47.041
I-I KNOW MY LEAVING TRIGGERS
YOU. I KNOW YOU ARE TRIGGERED.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.625
BUT THIS ISN'T THE SAME.
SO PLEASE JUST--

27:49.667 --> 27:51.625
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
DON'T DO THIS TO US.

27:51.667 --> 27:55.291
JUST... LET'S BE SILENT
FOR A MINUTE. PLEASE.

27:55.333 --> 27:59.041
JUST... STAND HERE WITH ME.

28:13.834 --> 28:16.583
I'M GOING.

28:16.625 --> 28:19.917
YEAH, I KNOW.

28:24.083 --> 28:27.542
VIOLET, I LOVE YOU.

28:27.583 --> 28:30.291
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.166
(inhales and exhales deeply)

28:37.208 --> 28:39.041

28:41.834 --> 28:43.792

UH, IT'S AMELIA.

28:43.834 --> 28:46.250
(exhales) I WAS HOPING
YOU'D PICK UP.

28:46.291 --> 28:49.041

WITH THE PRACTICE

28:49.083 --> 28:51.083

WELL, NOW THIS MOTORCYCLE DUMMY
HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE,

28:54.083 --> 28:57.500
SO I'M, UH, KINDA WALKING INTO

29:07.083 --> 29:09.041

29:09.083 --> 29:11.041
UM... IT'S FINE.
I'LL BE FINE.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.041
I JUST... LOOK,
FORGET THAT I CALLED.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.875
I'M--I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
