00:17.838 --> 00:21.341
Exterior's well-kept.

00:21.375 --> 00:24.477
<i>Yard's in good shape.</i>

00:24.512 --> 00:27.213
<i>Cleaners need to be brought in
for full top-to-bottom service.</i>

00:29.383 --> 00:32.519
There's a strong, musty odor
that needs to be investigated.

00:32.552 --> 00:34.587
Possible leak.

00:46.534 --> 00:50.403
Power in the basement is
out. Probably just a breaker.

00:52.373 --> 00:54.374
<i>No visible signs of water damage.</i>

00:54.408 --> 00:56.342
<i>Odor is significantly
stronger down here,</i>

00:56.410 --> 01:00.113
Where there is a...

01:00.147 --> 01:01.247
wine room.

01:11.325 --> 01:13.460
Approximately 15 by...

01:31.011 --> 01:35.215
- Hi, there.
- Tasha?

01:35.249 --> 01:37.884
She's okay.
She had a very good surgeon,

01:37.918 --> 01:39.519
and she came through with flying colors.

01:44.024 --> 01:45.325
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:45.392 --> 01:47.260
I wouldn't move around too much.

01:47.294 --> 01:50.230
Your spleen, kidneys,
and liver are bruised.

01:51.899 --> 01:55.135
- The baby?
- I'm so sorry, Jane.

02:02.843 --> 02:05.512
I'm sure that...

02:05.546 --> 02:08.914
- I don't...
- Yeah.

02:14.822 --> 02:17.791
Everyone's been by...

02:17.825 --> 02:21.127
Frankie, Tommy, Korsak.

02:21.162 --> 02:23.129
And your mom's been here the whole time.

02:23.164 --> 02:25.064
She just went home to take a shower.

02:25.099 --> 02:27.500
She's gonna be very upset
you woke up when she was gone.

02:27.535 --> 02:30.003
I'll fake sleeping
when I hear her coming.

02:38.345 --> 02:42.982
- What is that?
- A baseball bouquet from Jack.

02:43.017 --> 02:46.352
They're all Grover Verben.

02:46.387 --> 02:49.422
It's his great-uncle.
Jack has hundreds of them.

02:49.456 --> 02:54.394
- So he didn't pay $500 for the...
- No.

02:56.230 --> 03:00.033
He thought you could give them out
as "thanks for visiting" gifts.

03:00.067 --> 03:05.805
- That's a very... odd idea.
- I know.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.874
You guys are perfect for each other.

03:14.315 --> 03:17.383
Dr. Isles.

03:17.418 --> 03:19.185
Okay, go ahead and take the photographs

03:19.220 --> 03:21.054
and ask a technician
to collect the vitals.

03:21.088 --> 03:24.390
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Okay. Yes, I'll talk to you soon.

03:26.227 --> 03:28.494
- Maura...
- I know what you're going to say.

03:28.529 --> 03:31.164
- I have a job to do.
- You have a job to do.

03:31.232 --> 03:32.932
Go to the crime scene.

03:32.967 --> 03:35.101
- I'll be fine.
- You'll be fine.

03:37.071 --> 03:39.338
I'm sure you will.

03:40.274 --> 03:42.809
But that person isn't
gonna be any less dead

03:42.843 --> 03:45.411
if I wait just for a little bit.

04:16.010 --> 04:18.511
<i>- A panda needs to consume...
- Find your true love.</i>

04:18.579 --> 04:20.213
<i>Here's a special important...</i>

04:22.883 --> 04:25.218
Hi, sweetheart.

04:25.252 --> 04:26.819
I know you're faking.

04:32.927 --> 04:36.496
- What, did you go to a carnival?
- Isn't it adorable?

04:36.530 --> 04:42.201
- It's... big.
- It's a "hug me tight" teddy bear.

04:42.236 --> 04:46.372
I wanted you to have something
to hold when I'm not here.

04:48.275 --> 04:51.210
I thought you might be
hungry. I made you a sandwich.

04:53.013 --> 04:55.782
White bread and cheese.

04:55.849 --> 04:59.218
It's what you always wanted when
you stayed home sick from school.

04:59.253 --> 05:01.054
I was thinking more hot wings.

05:01.088 --> 05:03.423
No.
How about a little gin rummy?

05:07.061 --> 05:09.963
- I don't know, Ma.
- Afraid I'll beat you?

05:09.997 --> 05:12.065
You haven't beaten me
since I was in grade school.

05:12.132 --> 05:15.435
Yeah, well, I'm gonna take
advantage of your weakened state.

05:17.471 --> 05:19.138
All right.

05:24.478 --> 05:26.479
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:26.513 --> 05:31.384
- Yeah? How do you know that?
- Because I've been there.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.186
What does that mean?

05:35.422 --> 05:38.891
I had a miscarriage about
a year before you were born.

05:38.926 --> 05:41.427
Oh, Ma, I never knew that.

05:41.462 --> 05:46.199
- I kept it to myself. That's what we did.
- Was pop there for you?

05:46.233 --> 05:51.437
I think it was hard for him
to understand how I felt.

05:52.973 --> 05:56.943
- How did you feel?
- Sad.

05:56.977 --> 05:58.811
Devastated.

06:00.514 --> 06:05.018
I was also confused.
I-I couldn't understand

06:05.052 --> 06:08.488
how I could have such a sense of loss

06:08.522 --> 06:12.291
for something that I never really had.

06:16.363 --> 06:19.866
I think you should share how
you're feeling with somebody.

06:23.504 --> 06:28.274
Yes. I just don't think I'm
ready to talk about it yet.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.445
You'll know when the time is right.

06:35.115 --> 06:37.750
Come on. Play cards with me.

06:37.785 --> 06:40.253
I'm feeling very lucky.

06:42.956 --> 06:44.891
<i>Jane's doctor said she should be able</i>

06:44.925 --> 06:46.893
<i>to leave the hospital
by the end of the week.</i>

06:46.927 --> 06:48.761
- How are her spirits?
- Well, when I left,

06:48.829 --> 06:51.064
she made me promise to call
her and fill her in on the case.

06:51.098 --> 06:52.965
Sounds like she's
already feeling better.

06:53.033 --> 06:54.801
I hope so.

06:57.337 --> 07:01.707
You were right.
This body is beautifully preserved.

07:01.742 --> 07:03.209
I don't think I said "beautifully."

07:03.277 --> 07:05.278
I'm pretty sure I
compared her to beef jerky.

07:05.312 --> 07:08.414
And this is the perfect
environment to preserve it...

07:08.449 --> 07:11.784
cool, dry, just like the Egyptians
created for their mummies.

07:11.852 --> 07:13.986
I never understood why they
went to all the trouble.

07:14.054 --> 07:17.523
So their eternal spirits could recognize
their earthly bodies after death.

07:17.558 --> 07:19.959
Why couldn't they just keep
it simple and wear funny hats?

07:19.993 --> 07:22.361
I don't think
simple was their objective.

07:22.396 --> 07:24.897
They went to great lengths
for their preparations.

07:24.932 --> 07:27.400
For instance, did you know
that the brain was pulled out

07:27.434 --> 07:30.403
through the nasal passages
with a special hooked wire?

07:30.437 --> 07:33.339
No.
Kind of wish I didn't know it now.

07:33.407 --> 07:36.109
Well, there are no visible
external injuries...

07:36.176 --> 07:39.745
no entrance wounds, blunt-force
trauma, or blood loss.

07:39.813 --> 07:41.914
No, and nothing we found in
the house points to foul play.

07:41.949 --> 07:44.016
<i>Makes me wonder if she
died of natural causes.</i>

07:44.051 --> 07:46.986
With this much decay, how long will
it take to make a determination?

07:47.020 --> 07:52.125
Well, it took me five seconds.
This woman didn't die of natural causes.

07:52.159 --> 07:54.526
She was poisoned.

08:01.423 --> 08:05.157
She looks like I feel after
sitting at my desk all day.

08:05.191 --> 08:07.092
Maybe you need to
get up and stretch more often.

08:07.127 --> 08:09.695
Duly noted. Any idea
how long she's been dead?

08:09.729 --> 08:14.099
Well, it's difficult to say.
More than 2 years, less than 10.

08:14.134 --> 08:15.934
Is that based on the
dryness of the corpse?

08:15.969 --> 08:17.403
No... the collar of her shirt.

08:17.437 --> 08:20.873
That was a very popular
style in the mid-aughts.

08:20.907 --> 08:23.142
Huh. Who says fashion doesn't
have a place in forensics?

08:23.176 --> 08:27.068
- Certainly not me.
- You gonna be able to

08:27.069 --> 08:29.248
tell what poison was used
with her tissue samples?

08:29.282 --> 08:31.850
No.
Uh, even though the skin was intact,

08:31.918 --> 08:34.753
the organs inside the body liquefied
and, over time, turned to dust.

08:34.788 --> 08:37.121
- So we're screwed?
- Not quite.

08:37.157 --> 08:40.759
The diptera larvae... the maggots...

08:40.794 --> 08:43.729
they feasted on the victim's flesh,

08:43.797 --> 08:48.033
died of the same poison
before they morphed into flies.

08:48.068 --> 08:51.036
- So you are...?
- Making a maggot milkshake.

08:53.373 --> 08:56.875
I've collected the maggots'
tissue, casings, and feces,

08:56.910 --> 08:59.378
so I can extract trace
elements of poison.

09:01.948 --> 09:04.817
<i>I hope you didn't bring
that blender from home.</i>

09:04.851 --> 09:07.453
<i>- What?!
- I said I hope...</i>

09:07.487 --> 09:08.887
<i>Never mind.</i>

09:12.459 --> 09:17.196
This is a nice room.
You can rest, watch baseball on TV...

09:19.866 --> 09:22.735
...play along with the game shows.

09:22.769 --> 09:26.872
- You suck at small talk.
- I don't know what to say.

09:30.510 --> 09:34.813
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

09:34.848 --> 09:37.249
Really... you don't
have to worry about me.

09:37.283 --> 09:40.319
What kind of brother would I
be if I didn't worry about you?

09:42.422 --> 09:45.124
Oh, Janie.

09:48.795 --> 09:50.295
I'm so sorry.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.467
What can I do?

09:57.036 --> 10:01.173
- Why don't you tell me about the case?
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

10:01.207 --> 10:07.379
Uh... our victim's name is Fran
Clark, 38 years old, single female.

10:07.413 --> 10:09.047
Cause of death was poisoning.

10:09.082 --> 10:12.317
- Did you figure out when she died?
- 4 1/2 years ago.

10:12.352 --> 10:13.919
What?

10:13.953 --> 10:15.287
One day, she's using her
phone and credit cards.

10:15.321 --> 10:17.489
The next day, she wasn't.

10:17.524 --> 10:20.025
How did the body stay
undetected for that long?

10:20.059 --> 10:25.464
All of her bills are on Autopay,
her lights are on timers,

10:25.498 --> 10:29.134
mail went to a P.O.Box,
a gardener takes care of her yard.

10:29.169 --> 10:31.336
She didn't have anybody
that noticed she was missing?

10:31.371 --> 10:33.105
No friends, family, co-workers?

10:33.139 --> 10:35.374
No, the neighbors said
she kept to herself.

10:35.408 --> 10:37.442
And according to some messages I found

10:37.510 --> 10:40.145
on her answering machine
from her stepfather,

10:40.180 --> 10:43.453
she and her mother were estranged.

10:44.117 --> 10:47.954
- I'd love to hear those messages.
- I thought you'd say that.

10:50.156 --> 10:51.990
<i>Fran, it's Howard.</i>

10:52.025 --> 10:53.826
<i>I'm calling again because
the cancer's gotten worse.</i>

10:53.860 --> 10:57.296
<i>You two have to patch things
up before it's too late.</i>

10:57.330 --> 11:01.867
He left her another message
after the mother passed away.

11:01.901 --> 11:06.305
<i>Fran, your mother died this morning.
The funeral's on Wednesday.</i>

11:06.372 --> 11:08.974
<i>I know you two had trouble,
but come and say goodbye.</i>

11:09.008 --> 11:10.843
<i>I don't want you to regret it later.</i>

11:10.877 --> 11:12.244
Any sign that she went?

11:12.278 --> 11:15.780
I guess we'll find out.
The stepfather's coming in.

11:18.284 --> 11:21.420
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing back so soon?

11:21.454 --> 11:23.989
Well, I figured out what
kind of poison was used,

11:24.023 --> 11:25.891
and I figured you were dying to know.

11:25.959 --> 11:29.995
- It was Hemlock.
- As in ancient Greece?

11:30.029 --> 11:33.098
Well, the way that
she died... alone...

11:33.132 --> 11:35.133
poisoned by something that no one's used

11:35.168 --> 11:37.922
since socrates killed
himself 2,000 years ago...

11:38.972 --> 11:41.006
You should have Korsak
ask the stepfather

11:41.040 --> 11:44.810
- about Fran's mental health.
- I'll call him.

11:44.844 --> 11:49.101
- Thanks for keeping me in the loop.
- As if we have a choice.

11:54.387 --> 11:56.555
Four years, and nobody noticed?

11:56.589 --> 11:59.458
- Not that we know of.
- Poor thing.

11:59.492 --> 12:02.995
So, Howard, you say you were married
to Fran's mother for six years.

12:03.062 --> 12:04.363
Yeah.

12:04.397 --> 12:05.898
What were she and her
mother fighting about?

12:05.965 --> 12:09.334
My wife never really
wanted to talk about it.

12:09.369 --> 12:13.505
I'm not sure I know anything
that's gonna be helpful.

12:13.539 --> 12:17.009
Look, we need to figure
out what happened to Fran.

12:17.043 --> 12:19.044
And although it's not what
we would have wanted for her,

12:19.078 --> 12:20.412
it's better to know the truth.

12:20.446 --> 12:22.848
Are you sure there's
nothing you can tell me?

12:22.882 --> 12:26.351
Well, I hate to say this, especially
now, but I didn't like her.

12:26.386 --> 12:30.355
<i>She was mean, difficult.
She broke her mother's heart.</i>

12:30.390 --> 12:33.792
I tried to bring them back together
when my wife was on her deathbed,

12:33.826 --> 12:36.028
but after she passed away,
I never wanted to see Fran again.

12:36.062 --> 12:39.464
- I can understand that.
- Frankly, I'm not surprised she died.

12:39.499 --> 12:43.335
She never went outside,
never got any exercise,

12:43.369 --> 12:47.039
survived on frozen food,
candy bars, red wine.

12:47.106 --> 12:49.541
- What about friends?
- None that I knew of.

12:49.575 --> 12:52.311
How about work?
On several financial filings,

12:52.345 --> 12:54.446
she listed her occupation
as "freelance contractor."

12:54.480 --> 12:58.771
She wrote computer code for banks,
but she never went to the office.

12:59.585 --> 13:01.787
Man.

13:01.821 --> 13:04.389
When you start talking about
all this, this is so sad.

13:04.457 --> 13:09.161
I bet there's not one
person who misses her.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.931
Do you think she was capable
of taking her own life?

13:15.335 --> 13:18.864
Maybe. I hope not.

13:28.281 --> 13:30.916
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.250
Uh, can I have Tasha
Williams' room number, please?

13:32.285 --> 13:34.353
Are you family?

13:34.387 --> 13:36.188
- Not exactly.
- Then I'm sorry.

13:36.222 --> 13:39.091
Since Tasha's underage,
I can't give out her room number.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.525
Okay.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.795
Well, um, she's a witness
in a homicide investigation,

13:43.830 --> 13:45.430
so I need to know her room number

13:45.465 --> 13:51.370
- and everything related to her care.
- Really?

13:51.437 --> 13:53.939
Everything that Detective
Rizzoli said is true.

13:54.007 --> 13:58.142
Though she might have fudged
some causal connections.

14:00.847 --> 14:02.180
218.

14:02.248 --> 14:04.416
I'll give you a few minutes,
but then she needs her rest.

14:04.450 --> 14:05.751
Thank you.

14:05.785 --> 14:07.617
Oh. You like baseball?

14:08.187 --> 14:12.195
- Was Ted Kennedy a liberal?
- Here.

14:14.193 --> 14:16.962
- Grover Verben, the Lefty Lion?
- Yeah.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.230
Why are you giving this to me?

14:18.264 --> 14:20.165
Just my way of saying thanks.

14:20.199 --> 14:23.554
- For what?
- For taking care of Tasha.

14:25.371 --> 14:28.540
This is too much. Mm.

14:28.574 --> 14:33.378
<i>Dr. Yates to surgical step down.
Dr. Yates to surgical step down.</i>

14:33.663 --> 14:35.664
Tasha.

14:35.698 --> 14:38.199
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:39.802 --> 14:43.738
Um, this is Dr. Maura Isles,

14:43.806 --> 14:46.300
- who you spoke to on the phone.
- Hello.

14:48.644 --> 14:52.447
- What's that thing?
- That?

14:52.481 --> 14:55.317
That is a "hug me tight" teddy bear.

14:55.351 --> 14:57.552
You know, in case you get lonely.

14:57.586 --> 15:00.155
I'm not really a hugger.

15:00.189 --> 15:01.956
And that's not really a bear.

15:01.991 --> 15:05.226
I didn't want to say
anything, but she's right.

15:05.261 --> 15:08.296
It's a panda...
ailuropoda melanoleuca.

15:08.531 --> 15:12.500
Which literally translates to "black-and-white
cat foot," not "bear foot"...

15:12.535 --> 15:15.336
more closely related to
raccoons than to bears.

15:15.371 --> 15:16.804
Yeah, I am afraid not.

15:16.839 --> 15:19.440
A recent national science
study of DNA concluded

15:19.475 --> 15:21.476
that pandas are actually
more closely related

15:21.510 --> 15:23.945
to the spectacled bear of
South Africa than to raccoons.

15:24.013 --> 15:25.713
Maybe.

15:25.748 --> 15:28.283
But their skull and dental
structures don't resemble bears,

15:28.317 --> 15:30.718
their feet don't have heel
pads, and they don't hibernate.

15:30.753 --> 15:32.453
So if they are bears,

15:32.488 --> 15:35.390
then they're all alone on
their own little bear island.

15:39.828 --> 15:41.396
So, we're agreed...

15:41.430 --> 15:44.732
it's part panda, part bear,
part raccoon, part cat.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.702
- I'm not agreeing to that.
- Jane, that is ridiculous.

15:47.736 --> 15:49.637
Yes, it is... absolutely ridiculous

15:49.672 --> 15:53.130
that a stuffed animal could
be genetically incorrect.

15:54.577 --> 15:58.880
The real reason we're here is
to tell you that you're safe.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.982
We got the guy that was after you.

16:02.351 --> 16:04.852
I... wasn't really worried.

16:04.887 --> 16:07.655
I'm sorry, ladies, but
visiting time is over.

16:07.723 --> 16:11.492
- That wasn't a few minutes.
- Our patient needs her rest.

16:16.565 --> 16:17.599
See you later.

16:21.337 --> 16:23.871
- Jane.
- Yeah?

16:26.375 --> 16:30.311
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

16:44.749 --> 16:46.283
Frankie, what do you got?

16:46.351 --> 16:47.651
We went back and combed
through all the victim's

16:47.686 --> 16:49.320
Autopay accounts and
found something strange.

16:49.354 --> 16:52.089
Fran's gardener, Joe
Martin, got a pay raise.

16:52.124 --> 16:53.858
Six months after Fran died.

16:53.892 --> 16:55.693
According to the bank, it was entered

16:55.727 --> 16:58.529
from her regular I.P.
address, using her password.

16:58.597 --> 17:00.264
Hemlock is a plant-based poison.

17:00.298 --> 17:03.567
And who knows more about
plants than a gardener?

17:03.602 --> 17:06.303
We found your fingerprints
on Fran's computer.

17:06.338 --> 17:09.073
You gave yourself a raise.
Anything else you helped yourself to?

17:09.107 --> 17:14.411
Okay, look, I knew she was dead,
but I didn't kill her.

17:14.646 --> 17:16.046
You knew she was dead?

17:16.080 --> 17:18.382
Yes. I-I found her that
way in the basement.

17:18.415 --> 17:22.819
- When?
- Uh, four years ago-ish.

17:22.854 --> 17:27.391
I went in to turn the sprinklers off
for the winter, and there she was.

17:27.425 --> 17:30.661
She didn't look exactly like that,
but she was definitely dead.

17:30.695 --> 17:33.464
So you just forgot to
tell someone about it?

17:33.531 --> 17:36.283
I should have, but I was low
on cash, so I just figured

17:36.284 --> 17:38.936
that I'd wait for the next
Autopay money to go through.

17:39.003 --> 17:41.872
<i>Then one thing led to
another, and... I didn't.</i>

17:41.940 --> 17:44.575
So you could keep
collecting the payments?

17:44.609 --> 17:47.311
I figured somebody else would find her.

17:47.345 --> 17:49.456
And since she was dead, you thought
you'd just help yourself

17:49.457 --> 17:51.815
- to her bank accounts?
- No.

17:51.850 --> 17:55.085
Look...
a few months after I found Fran,

17:55.120 --> 17:56.787
my girlfriend kicked me out.

17:56.821 --> 17:58.822
So I moved into the
room above the garage.

17:58.857 --> 18:00.991
A-and occasionally,
I'd go into the house.

18:01.025 --> 18:03.560
And her password was right
there by her computer.

18:03.595 --> 18:05.896
So I gave myself a raise
because I deserved it.

18:05.930 --> 18:08.432
I'd been doing lots of extra
work around the house...

18:08.466 --> 18:11.666
- you know, since she couldn't.
- Unbelievable.

18:12.470 --> 18:15.873
If you think I killed her for the money,
then why didn't I take more?

18:15.940 --> 18:19.295
I had... I had plenty of
time to steal everything.

18:20.979 --> 18:24.748
I liked Fran.
She was nice to me.

18:24.783 --> 18:27.351
Did you see anyone else at
the house before she died?

18:27.385 --> 18:30.654
Well, there... there was this
one guy I saw a couple of times.

18:30.688 --> 18:33.765
He's a skinny white dude with a beard.

18:34.058 --> 18:37.428
- So, can I go now?
- No.

18:37.495 --> 18:41.197
We're gonna leave you here
and see if somebody finds you.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.429
Detective Rizzoli, this is Cathy
Graff, Tasha's social worker.

18:55.464 --> 18:57.565
I informed her you needed
to be kept in the loop,

18:57.599 --> 19:00.101
uh, since Tasha is a
witness in one of your cases.

19:00.135 --> 19:02.536
Yes, um...

19:02.571 --> 19:04.852
we... we just need to know
what social services' plan are

19:04.873 --> 19:06.707
so BPD can maintain contact with her.

19:06.742 --> 19:09.277
Well, we always like to
place children with a family,

19:09.311 --> 19:11.779
But because of Tasha's age
and years on the street,

19:11.814 --> 19:15.416
adoptive parents and foster families
will be suspicious of drugs,

19:15.450 --> 19:17.185
<i>prostitution, emotional difficulties.</i>

19:17.252 --> 19:19.287
Well... well, she doesn't
have those problems.

19:19.321 --> 19:21.656
Still, potential guardians
may be suspicious.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.357
Well, uh, you could spend
five minutes with her,

19:23.392 --> 19:24.692
and you know she's a good kid.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.361
That may be true, but this
is a complex situation.

19:27.396 --> 19:30.097
There is nothing complex
about it. It's very simple.

19:30.132 --> 19:32.633
This is a girl who needs
love, guidance, and rules.

19:32.668 --> 19:36.170
I have a girl just like Tasha
who is a thriving college freshman.

19:36.205 --> 19:37.738
I'm not saying it's right.

19:37.773 --> 19:40.141
I'm just telling you it's
the reality of the system.

19:40.175 --> 19:42.543
The likelihood is that
Tasha will be placed

19:42.578 --> 19:44.879
in a group home with
girls of a similar age.

19:44.913 --> 19:48.516
- That sucks.
- I'm sorry.

19:48.550 --> 19:50.818
I'll call you when we have a placement.

19:52.988 --> 19:55.390
How long is Tasha supposed
to stay in the hospital?

19:55.424 --> 19:57.992
A week... 10 days tops.

19:59.461 --> 20:00.662
Thank you.

20:02.898 --> 20:04.465
Hey, Korsak.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.868
I talked to several of
the gardener's customers.

20:06.902 --> 20:09.037
They said he was honest, reliable,

20:09.071 --> 20:11.272
trustworthy, heck of a good guy.

20:11.307 --> 20:13.341
I've been through all
of Fran's bank records.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.411
Nothing else is missing.
All he took was the extra $25 a month.

20:16.445 --> 20:19.581
Well, with the password,
he could have cleaned out her accounts.

20:19.648 --> 20:23.351
Okay, so maybe he didn't kill her,
but not telling anyone she was dead

20:23.385 --> 20:26.487
probably disqualifies him from
the "heck of a good guy" award.

20:26.522 --> 20:30.124
I tested the wine residue on the glass
that we found next to the victim.

20:30.159 --> 20:31.559
<i>"The wine that
evaporated from that glass</i>

20:31.594 --> 20:35.229
was a cheap domestic table wine
without a trace of Hemlock in it."

20:35.264 --> 20:37.031
How's that possible?

20:39.201 --> 20:41.135
The killer could have
put poison in her glass,

20:41.203 --> 20:42.503
then poured it out when she was dead,

20:42.538 --> 20:44.172
then cleaned the glass
and replaced the good wine

20:44.206 --> 20:45.607
with a cheap one he brought with him.

20:45.641 --> 20:47.508
There were 500 bottles
of wine in that cellar.

20:47.543 --> 20:49.143
Why bring a cheap bottle

20:49.178 --> 20:51.145
when you could just open
one that was already there?

20:51.180 --> 20:53.548
Wine collectors often keep
lists of their inventory online.

20:53.582 --> 20:55.183
Perhaps the killer was concerned

20:55.217 --> 20:57.185
that the bottle would
be noticed as missing.

20:57.219 --> 20:59.320
Well, at least we finally
know one thing for sure...

20:59.355 --> 21:01.923
somebody concocted an elaborate scheme

21:01.957 --> 21:04.125
to make it look like fran
died of natural causes.

21:04.159 --> 21:06.461
All we have to do is figure out why.

21:17.506 --> 21:19.907
How's the mutant?

21:19.975 --> 21:24.579
A bit lumpy, anatomically
incorrect, and highly flammable.

21:30.152 --> 21:34.622
- Social services came by today.
- I know. She came and talked to me.

21:34.657 --> 21:40.194
- I told her I can take care of myself.
- Yes, you can.

21:40.262 --> 21:42.530
And you have.

21:42.564 --> 21:44.932
But now that someone
like me is involved,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.268
you can't do it by
yourself... not anymore.

21:47.302 --> 21:50.505
- I don't need your help.
- That's not the point.

21:50.539 --> 21:52.907
Look, when you turn 18, you
can do whatever you want.

21:52.941 --> 21:55.643
But until then, we have to
find you someplace to live.

21:55.678 --> 21:59.480
- No one wants a kid like me.
- Tasha.

22:04.019 --> 22:06.287
If you think that you can stick me

22:06.321 --> 22:09.357
in some crappy group
home, then you're wrong.

22:11.427 --> 22:16.685
I'll run away again.
And this time, you won't find me.

22:20.602 --> 22:24.872
The password we got from the gardener
also worked on Fran's smartphone.

22:24.907 --> 22:26.941
Remember what the gardener said?

22:26.975 --> 22:30.645
That her only friend was a
skinny white dude with a beard.

22:32.114 --> 22:34.015
<i>The firewall is for my protection, Bill.</i>

22:34.049 --> 22:35.650
<i>It gives me a say in
how things are done.</i>

22:35.684 --> 22:38.252
<i>But nothing's getting done,
because you've blocked me out!</i>

22:38.287 --> 22:40.621
<i>Well, I guess now you'll
have to listen to me.</i>

22:40.656 --> 22:42.356
<i>Listen, you little bitch,</i>

22:42.424 --> 22:46.386
<i>if you don't take that damn
firewall down, I'll kill you.</i>

22:48.063 --> 22:49.831
<i>Don't push me.</i>

22:51.667 --> 22:54.402
The only thing the gardener
got wrong about this guy

22:54.470 --> 22:56.537
was that they were friends.

22:59.980 --> 23:03.057
<i>If you don't take that damn
firewall down, I'll kill you.</i>

23:03.058 --> 23:07.127
- I didn't mean "kill" kill her.
- What kind of kill did you mean?

23:07.162 --> 23:10.598
- You know, the funny kind.
- I'm not laughing.

23:10.632 --> 23:12.967
Look, Fran and I worked
together at the bank.

23:13.001 --> 23:15.502
She wrote code.
I had an idea for an app.

23:15.537 --> 23:18.872
We got into an argument.
She locked me out of the program.

23:18.907 --> 23:21.075
I-I got pissed.
That's all you see there.

23:21.109 --> 23:24.712
Look, I found her like that.
I had nothing to do with it.

23:24.746 --> 23:28.616
- You found her?
- What? No. Uh...

23:28.683 --> 23:30.551
Frankie, we should just
let this guy keep talking.

23:30.585 --> 23:32.886
He's doing a fine job
of hanging himself.

23:32.921 --> 23:33.921
Bill.

23:35.056 --> 23:37.491
We now have a recording of
you saying "I found her,"

23:37.525 --> 23:38.892
which puts you on the scene.

23:38.927 --> 23:41.695
<i>Her financial stake in
the app gives you motive.</i>

23:41.730 --> 23:44.064
And the nuance of "I didn't do it"

23:44.099 --> 23:46.634
is something a jury
might not care about.

23:46.668 --> 23:50.004
After the fight on the video,
I knew that we couldn't work together.

23:50.071 --> 23:53.807
So I offered her some royalty payments
in exchange for notes on code.

23:53.842 --> 23:55.776
It actually worked for a few weeks.

23:56.010 --> 24:00.180
- Then she stopped sending me notes.
- So you went to her house?

24:00.215 --> 24:03.810
Well, not at first, but after four
months, I started to think that she

24:03.811 --> 24:06.327
was mad at me, that...
that she might sue me

24:06.328 --> 24:08.789
for breach of contract.
That's when I went by.

24:08.823 --> 24:12.826
And found a dead woman in her basement.
Did it dawn on you to call someone?

24:12.861 --> 24:14.328
- I did.
- Who?

24:14.395 --> 24:17.197
I made an anonymous
phone call to the police.

24:17.232 --> 24:20.801
- And?
- Nothing happened.

24:22.337 --> 24:24.304
So you figured, if no
one knew she was dead,

24:24.339 --> 24:26.897
no one would know that
you owed her money?

24:27.375 --> 24:28.375
Yes.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.346
Why did it take you
four months to check in?

24:32.380 --> 24:34.848
I thought Fran was
busy doing other things.

24:34.883 --> 24:38.218
- And it's not like she needed my money.
- What do you mean?

24:38.253 --> 24:40.454
She had money... a lot of it.

24:43.258 --> 24:44.758
Her inheritance.

24:47.495 --> 24:50.063
That guy was telling the
truth about the welfare call.

24:50.098 --> 24:52.432
Police got an anonymous call,
went by the house to check.

24:52.467 --> 24:54.768
Everything looked fine.
No one answered the door.

24:54.802 --> 24:56.470
Well, hard for a mummy
to run to the door.

24:56.504 --> 24:58.272
How about the inheritance?

24:58.306 --> 25:01.975
Fran's mom had less than $90,000
in net assets when she died.

25:02.010 --> 25:05.846
She gave it to the stepdad.
But Fran's father died seven years ago.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.983
There are no court records of a will,
and his lawyer is dead,

25:10.018 --> 25:13.873
but he had almost a million dollars
in property at the time of his death.

25:13.874 --> 25:16.623
- No other relatives?
- None that I've found.

25:16.658 --> 25:18.859
Well, that money had to go somewhere.

25:18.927 --> 25:21.361
We can't find any sign that it
went through Fran's accounts.

25:21.396 --> 25:23.163
What'd she do... turn her dad's estate

25:23.197 --> 25:25.365
into "Die Hard" bearer bonds
and hide them in the mattress?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.802
And we need to dig into her background,
starting from when her father died.

25:28.836 --> 25:30.671
Somebody knew she'd
gotten a pot of gold.

25:30.705 --> 25:32.739
We have to figure out who it is.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.881
How are you feeling today?

25:40.915 --> 25:44.918
Hey. Well, I've beaten my
mother 30 consecutive times,

25:44.953 --> 25:46.420
so... pretty good.

25:46.454 --> 25:49.611
Yeah. She's cheating.
I just don't know how.

25:50.670 --> 25:51.830
Well, I spoke to your doctor,

25:51.859 --> 25:54.061
and he says you're being
a very good patient.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.696
Yeah.

25:55.730 --> 25:58.298
I'm hoping for early parole
based on good behavior.

25:58.333 --> 25:59.499
Gin.

26:01.486 --> 26:04.054
Have you checked under her
pillow for a secret deck?

26:04.088 --> 26:05.789
- Whose side are you on?
- Mine.

26:13.431 --> 26:15.198
Rizzoli.

26:16.501 --> 26:21.338
What? Okay. I'll be right there.

26:23.407 --> 26:26.343
- You're supposed to stay in bed!
- Jane, your mother is right.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.844
You cannot be getting out of bed.

26:27.879 --> 26:30.380
- Ple...
- Jane, where are you going?

26:30.414 --> 26:34.317
Fran bought a plane ticket two
months after her father's death.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.453
Plenty of time to get
control of her inheritance.

26:36.487 --> 26:39.790
- Where was she headed?
- The Caymans. She stayed 24 hours.

26:39.857 --> 26:41.925
If you're on vacation,
you stay longer than that.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.227
- It's a stop-and-drop.
- Yeah. And I found the hotel.

26:44.262 --> 26:46.830
The room was comped by the
Grand Cayman National Bank.

26:46.864 --> 26:49.366
How are we gonna get a
subpoena for an offshore bank?

26:49.400 --> 26:50.867
<i>Got to get a federal
judge and some evidence</i>

26:50.902 --> 26:52.502
<i>of a violation of
international banking law.</i>

26:52.537 --> 26:53.870
It's not gonna be easy.

26:56.340 --> 26:59.109
Is it still wire fraud if you
don't actually send the money?

27:01.312 --> 27:02.813
<i>Thank you for calling
Grand Cayman National Bank.</i>

27:02.880 --> 27:03.914
<i>How can I help you?</i>

27:03.981 --> 27:07.083
I need my account balance, but
it's kind of embarrassing...

27:07.118 --> 27:08.919
I've forgotten my account number.

27:08.953 --> 27:11.154
What's the name and the
address on the account?

27:11.189 --> 27:14.858
Fran Clark.
2020 Bingham Drive, Boston.

27:14.892 --> 27:16.359
Your password, please?

27:16.427 --> 27:22.199
7, 9, capital "G," 2,
0, "p," hashtag, 11.

27:24.001 --> 27:25.969
<i>At today's current rate of exchange,</i>

27:26.003 --> 27:33.076
<i>the balance in that
account is $878,529.17.</i>

27:33.110 --> 27:35.178
<i>Is there anything else I
can do f you, Ms. Clark?</i>

27:35.246 --> 27:37.380
No. Thank you.

27:38.873 --> 27:42.661
And that's why you shouldn't have
the same password for all your accounts.

27:52.263 --> 27:55.365
- How long has she been gone?
- I don't know.

28:05.641 --> 28:10.310
- What about the security cameras?
- I've got people watching every door,

28:10.344 --> 28:11.887
and we've reviewed the
tapes from every exit since

28:11.888 --> 28:13.279
she was last seen. There's
been no sign of her.

28:13.314 --> 28:15.648
Okay, um, can you check the stairwells,

28:15.683 --> 28:17.650
unoccupied rooms, and
...and supply closets?

28:17.685 --> 28:19.085
We're looking everywhere.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.753
You need to check all
the delivery services

28:20.788 --> 28:22.055
and see if they had trucks
here at the hospital.

28:22.089 --> 28:23.823
She could have climbed
inside one of those.

28:23.858 --> 28:27.093
- I'll get someone on it.
- Thank you.

28:27.428 --> 28:30.597
Korsak is sending patrol units
to search around the hospital.

28:30.631 --> 28:33.233
- I spooked her.
- No, you were trying to help.

28:33.267 --> 28:34.834
Same result.

28:34.869 --> 28:38.494
Look, there are a lot of people
looking for her. She won't get far.

28:40.174 --> 28:42.075
Should we go back to your room?

28:42.109 --> 28:44.844
No. And... and... and
you got to get back to work.

28:44.879 --> 28:48.114
- No, I-I-I don't.
- Yeah, you do. Go.

28:50.244 --> 28:52.301
Okay.
Um, I'll come back tonight?

28:52.336 --> 28:53.829
Okay.

30:12.666 --> 30:14.866
How'd you find me?

30:16.337 --> 30:18.137
Well, it was pretty smart...

30:18.172 --> 30:20.974
knowing that security
would be watching the doors.

30:22.176 --> 30:25.245
Stay hidden down here
until they stopped.

30:25.279 --> 30:28.147
You're good at your job
aren't you?

30:29.883 --> 30:32.018
Most days.

30:32.052 --> 30:36.756
Not today, when I came to talk
to you about social services.

30:39.026 --> 30:42.778
I need to get a doctor to check you out,
make sure you're okay.

30:42.813 --> 30:43.863
I'm okay.

30:43.897 --> 30:48.700
That's not exactly the medical
assessment I was hoping for.

30:53.173 --> 30:55.608
Look...

30:55.643 --> 31:00.640
out on the street,
I've kept my grades up.

31:03.166 --> 31:05.501
If I could just...

31:07.538 --> 31:10.473
If I could just graduate high school,

31:10.507 --> 31:16.112
I could get a job...
maybe go to college.

31:18.982 --> 31:24.153
But if I get stuck in some group home,
it'll be impossible.

31:25.489 --> 31:27.023
Tasha...

31:29.860 --> 31:34.530
I'm not gonna let some group home
full of girls screw up your GPA.

31:34.565 --> 31:37.133
<i>I promise.</i>

31:37.167 --> 31:40.122
But I need you to trust me.

31:40.157 --> 31:43.372
Please.

31:48.478 --> 31:52.006
I'm not gonna let you down, baby.

32:00.540 --> 32:03.642
I can't find anyone who
knew about the inheritance.

32:03.677 --> 32:07.146
- What about the stepfather?
- Said he couldn't help.

32:07.180 --> 32:09.448
He married the mom
after Fran got the money.

32:09.482 --> 32:11.999
But I called the neighbors,
trying to find someone who knew

32:12.000 --> 32:12.584
- her mom back then.
- Any luck?

32:12.619 --> 32:14.253
Yeah, the lady down the block said

32:14.287 --> 32:15.927
that she and Fran's
mom were good friends.

32:15.956 --> 32:17.856
She told me what a
wonderful woman she was

32:17.891 --> 32:19.558
and that it was a real shame...

32:19.592 --> 32:22.328
she looked like she was getting
better, then died suddenly.

32:22.395 --> 32:24.830
Suddenly?
I thought she died of cancer.

32:24.864 --> 32:26.978
Well, that's what we heard.
I called her doctor.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.701
He wouldn't talk to me.
Did you have better luck?

32:28.735 --> 32:32.471
The threat of an official visit from
the medical examiner works every time.

32:32.505 --> 32:35.747
Yeah. Who wants you sitting
in their waiting room, right?

32:38.745 --> 32:41.947
No. Not... not "you."

32:41.982 --> 32:43.549
It's... it's... it's the office.

32:43.616 --> 32:44.917
- Okay. I get it. I get it.
- It's... it's... it's...

32:44.951 --> 32:48.921
So, our victim's mother
had stage IV lung cancer.

32:48.955 --> 32:51.762
When traditional drugs failed,
she was accepted into a trial

32:51.763 --> 32:54.259
for a new A.L.K. inhibitor.
It worked.

32:54.294 --> 32:55.861
She went into remission,
and the doctor thought

32:55.895 --> 32:57.596
that she would have
a meaningful recovery.

32:57.630 --> 32:59.765
- But she didn't?
- No.

32:59.799 --> 33:03.702
- She died unexpectedly two weeks later.
- Was there an autopsy?

33:03.737 --> 33:05.904
Since she was a cancer patient
and under a doctor's care,

33:05.939 --> 33:07.406
there was no autopsy,

33:07.440 --> 33:10.542
and her husband had her
cremated the next day.

33:10.577 --> 33:14.471
So the stepfather killed the mom, too?

33:15.615 --> 33:17.282
First, he killed Fran,

33:17.317 --> 33:18.951
thought he'd get all the
money when his wife died.

33:18.985 --> 33:21.387
But then her remission meant
she wasn't dying fast enough,

33:21.454 --> 33:23.489
so he felt like he
didn't have any choice.

33:26.009 --> 33:28.777
Well, I don't know
what you were thinking.

33:28.811 --> 33:30.879
If your stitches had opened
up, you could have bled

33:30.880 --> 33:32.760
to death before Detective
Rizzoli had found you.

33:32.782 --> 33:35.517
- But I didn't.
- By the grace of god.

33:35.552 --> 33:38.120
But since you've shown that you
clearly don't have any sense,

33:38.154 --> 33:40.856
we're gonna have to keep
an eye on you night and day.

33:40.890 --> 33:42.558
Careful.

33:45.962 --> 33:48.096
<i>Take your meds.</i>

33:57.707 --> 33:59.908
Cathy, it's Detective Jane Rizzoli.

33:59.976 --> 34:02.543
Uh, we were talking
about Tasha Williams.

34:03.446 --> 34:05.847
Yes, um, I have a question.

34:05.882 --> 34:11.282
What does it take for a single
woman to become a foster parent?

34:15.678 --> 34:18.413
<i>I guess if you have a
reclusive step daughter</i>

34:18.480 --> 34:21.049
<i>and a dying wife, that 800
grand seems like easy pickings.</i>

34:21.083 --> 34:22.917
Ah, what are the odds of
two people tripping over

34:22.952 --> 34:24.552
the same body and not
doing anything about it?

34:24.585 --> 34:27.889
Well, if he hadn't have killed his wife,
we might never have known.

34:27.922 --> 34:29.824
The problem is, we
can't prove any of it.

34:29.858 --> 34:32.726
What if we got the wife's ashes?
Would that have forensic value?

34:32.761 --> 34:36.664
Cremation requires temperatures
in excess of 1,100 degrees,

34:36.699 --> 34:40.101
and that destroys DNA, so even
if you could detect some pathogen,

34:40.135 --> 34:42.503
you wouldn't be able to say
it came from the mother's body.

34:42.538 --> 34:43.972
We'll just have to just
keep grinding away at it.

34:44.005 --> 34:46.975
We'll get something,
eventually... hopefully.

34:47.009 --> 34:50.645
That "hopefully" made you
sound a little less confident.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.679
Mmm.

34:52.715 --> 34:55.216
Can I have pizza?

34:56.185 --> 34:58.987
Yes, when the doctor
clears you for solid foods.

34:59.054 --> 35:00.588
I had a sandwich today.

35:00.622 --> 35:02.890
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

35:02.925 --> 35:05.360
Well, I hope it was delicious,

35:05.394 --> 35:09.198
because if it causes a
blockage, you will not be happy.

35:11.533 --> 35:12.633
I got it.

35:12.668 --> 35:16.471
- A blockage?
- No.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.529
An idea of how to throw a
monkey wrench into Howard's plan.

35:25.014 --> 35:26.748
- Mr. Ames.
- Oh.

35:26.782 --> 35:28.583
- Thanks for coming in.
- Of course.

35:28.617 --> 35:30.151
We're done with our investigation,

35:30.185 --> 35:32.387
and we've concluded
that Fran was poisoned.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.888
There's no evidence to suggest

35:33.956 --> 35:38.059
that it was at someone
else's hand, so...

35:38.093 --> 35:41.763
we think she committed suicide.
I'm sorry.

35:42.998 --> 35:44.632
Thank you.

35:44.666 --> 35:47.502
Our investigation is done,
but you'll likely be contacted

35:47.536 --> 35:49.570
by an investigator
from Grand Cayman Bank.

35:49.605 --> 35:52.373
- The Caymans?
- She had an account there.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.542
Well, what do they want
to talk to me about?

35:54.610 --> 35:57.045
We can't officially
close our investigation

35:57.079 --> 36:00.415
because we couldn't find any
financial or chemical evidence

36:00.482 --> 36:02.550
that Fran was in
possession of the poison.

36:02.584 --> 36:05.319
Cayman law requires
a clear cause of death

36:05.354 --> 36:07.655
before they'll allow transfer
of assets to an estate.

36:07.689 --> 36:10.058
Because we can't provide one,
their policy is to send in

36:10.092 --> 36:12.627
their own investigator
before they deny the transfer.

36:14.096 --> 36:16.130
Okay.

36:19.401 --> 36:22.036
I know you and your stepdaughter
weren't close, but...

36:23.772 --> 36:27.029
...I'm still very sorry for your loss.

36:34.917 --> 36:38.920
- So, they released you?
- They did. They sent me home.

36:38.954 --> 36:41.489
But the doctors still
have me on a short leash.

36:41.523 --> 36:44.025
And you get released
at the end of the week.

36:44.059 --> 36:45.526
Yep.

36:47.763 --> 36:49.831
Well, you know, there's
still that bit of business

36:49.865 --> 36:51.899
that we need to take
care of before I go...

36:51.934 --> 36:54.737
that group-home thing.

36:56.105 --> 36:58.806
I think we've found an alternative.

36:58.841 --> 37:05.480
Social services has agreed
to allow Gwen to be your foster parent,

37:05.547 --> 37:08.716
And she has graciously
agreed to take you in.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.718
I've got a daughter who's in college,

37:10.752 --> 37:12.353
so I have the room and I have the time.

37:12.387 --> 37:15.890
- But there's gonna be some rules.
- Rules?

37:15.958 --> 37:18.426
For starters, you have to
be home for dinner by 6:00,

37:18.460 --> 37:20.811
unless we've agreed
to something different.

37:22.467 --> 37:26.634
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go...

37:28.036 --> 37:30.471
...and let you guys
work out the details.

37:30.506 --> 37:32.073
I'll see you soon.

37:33.575 --> 37:35.977
<i>Bye, Jane.</i>

37:38.380 --> 37:41.949
Homework needs to be done before
you surf the net or watch TV.

37:41.984 --> 37:43.384
Of course.

37:43.418 --> 37:45.086
<i>And I know that you're
old enough to date,</i>

37:45.120 --> 37:48.022
but only on the weekends and
only if I've met them first.

37:48.056 --> 37:51.076
Pre-dating interviews? What
is this... Guantánamo?

37:52.628 --> 37:54.729
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

38:22.190 --> 38:24.693
You got greedy, Howard.

38:26.361 --> 38:28.896
This isn't an active crime
scene. You can't be here.

38:28.930 --> 38:32.366
Actually, the bank owns the house,
and they said we could come in.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.935
Technically, you're
breaking and entering.

38:34.970 --> 38:37.805
Frankie, you mind looking in that bag?

38:41.710 --> 38:45.212
Look at this, Korsak.
He's trying to provide the investigators

38:45.280 --> 38:48.682
with the evidence they need
to prove Fran's suicide.

38:48.750 --> 38:51.685
I'm sure you'll find traces
of Hemlock in that bag, too,

38:51.720 --> 38:53.687
which would be okay, if we'd
told you what killed her.

38:53.722 --> 38:55.189
<i>Read him his rights.</i>

38:55.223 --> 38:58.192
Howard Ames, you have the
right to remain silent.

38:58.260 --> 39:03.631
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

39:08.387 --> 39:12.190
- Okay. I put your stuff in a drawer.
- Thank you.

39:12.224 --> 39:14.259
And I bought you some of
that shampoo you like...

39:14.326 --> 39:16.567
you know, the one with all
the fruity-smelling chemicals.

39:16.595 --> 39:20.231
But you said that was like washing
my hair with dry-cleaning solution.

39:20.266 --> 39:23.334
Yeah, but it's like fruity-smelling
dry-cleaning solution.

39:23.369 --> 39:25.403
It's in the green bathroom.

39:25.471 --> 39:30.141
- How's it taste?
- It's... cold.

39:32.111 --> 39:34.646
Mm. What? You're having a beer?

39:34.680 --> 39:38.149
Well, you're choosing the menu tonight.

39:46.559 --> 39:50.595
- I actually like it.
- Yeah, no. See, that's how it starts.

39:50.629 --> 39:52.363
I will not be blamed

39:52.398 --> 39:56.090
if you start chugging beers
and belching the alphabet.

39:59.138 --> 40:01.206
So, how are you doing?

40:03.609 --> 40:05.577
How am I supposed to be doing?

40:07.980 --> 40:11.182
- I have no idea.
- Yeah, me neither.

40:14.220 --> 40:17.155
- Who's that?
- Probably your family.

40:17.223 --> 40:21.226
Ohh. I don't know if
I'm ready for all of them

40:21.260 --> 40:23.494
to pile in here and try
to make me feel better.

40:23.529 --> 40:26.231
I just wanted to relax and...

40:26.265 --> 40:31.102
feel like everything's
heading back to normal again.

40:31.136 --> 40:34.239
Okay. Well, I'll tell them.
I'm sure they'll understand.

40:39.044 --> 40:41.212
- Hi.
- Hail, hail. The gang's all here.

40:41.247 --> 40:43.248
- Hey!
- Hey, Janie.

40:43.282 --> 40:44.482
We got pizza now.
You can have pizza, right?

40:44.483 --> 40:45.806
- I forgot the key.
- The game's already on,

40:45.807 --> 40:47.185
- so we're gonna watch.
- Look who I found!

40:47.219 --> 40:49.754
<i>Come on, get it on. What
channel's it on here?</i>

40:49.788 --> 40:51.456
<i>- It's 12. It's 12.
- 4 or 12.</i>

40:51.490 --> 40:52.499
<i>Janie, can you get me an opener?</i>

40:52.554 --> 40:55.660
Someone put lead in your
shoes? No. Get it yourself.

40:55.694 --> 40:58.229
Should I tell them to go?

40:58.264 --> 41:02.634
<i>Doubled, and now runners to
second, and he singled in the fifth.</i>

41:02.668 --> 41:03.668
Ready?

41:05.938 --> 41:07.972
<i>He's had a hit in every game.</i>

41:08.040 --> 41:10.046
- We got anchovies.
- You did not!

41:11.010 --> 41:14.078
- They look disgusting.
- Yes!

41:16.682 --> 41:18.315
Nyah!

41:19.018 --> 41:21.619
- Get in here.
- All right.

41:21.654 --> 41:24.722
- Where are they?
- Get your pizza.

41:24.757 --> 41:26.524
<i>- They're just awful.
- The spin on that!</i>

41:26.558 --> 41:30.093
- Ugh! Get off me.
- Oh! Please!

41:30.162 --> 41:33.102
<i>This guy can hit. Oh, come on!</i>

41:33.500 --> 41:36.319
<i>And strike 3 called.</i>

41:36.405 --> 41:38.515
<i>Oh!</i>

41:39.305 --> 41:45.680
