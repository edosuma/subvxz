00:31.480 --> 00:35.639
In 1964, every East End family

00:35.640 --> 00:37.717
had its connection to the wharfs.

00:37.920 --> 00:43.160
People belonged to the river,
and the river belonged to them.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.200
Watch out, son!

00:48.820 --> 00:52.753
And the Thames flowed on,
like time itself,

00:53.560 --> 00:57.160
bringing growth
and change and challenge.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.839
- Here, Dad.
- Nurse Franklin.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.319
Hello, Mr Brittall.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.960
The hospital let me dad
come home last night.

01:19.985 --> 01:22.865
Oh, I am pleased. It's so much
better that he's with his family.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.569
This isn't a social club, Barnie!

01:26.160 --> 01:27.880
I expect I'll be seeing you soon.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.666
That's it!

01:39.691 --> 01:41.564
I think I should
just try this blazer on.

01:41.885 --> 01:44.242
- Tim!
- Oh, sorry.

01:44.267 --> 01:47.022
Just for that,
you can be in the picture, too.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.906
All together now.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.559
Big smiles and...

01:56.924 --> 01:59.252
I've moved you to the
maternity home

01:59.277 --> 02:01.077
in my place, Miss Anderson.

02:01.367 --> 02:05.142
It'll mean a few extra calls
for Sister Frances,

02:05.315 --> 02:07.880
but I think she's ready.

02:08.235 --> 02:10.024
And she's got young legs.

02:10.049 --> 02:12.640
We'll manage, Phyllis,
please don't worry.

02:12.996 --> 02:14.749
This seems a lot worse
than last time.

02:14.774 --> 02:16.319
I think I should call an ambulance.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.625
No, no, it's just lumbago.

02:18.650 --> 02:21.392
Yes, hospital is best avoided.

02:22.771 --> 02:26.339
Nurse Crane, you are
clearly in a lot of pain,

02:26.364 --> 02:27.940
and I am going to call an ambulance.

02:30.292 --> 02:32.012
I shan't fight you.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.040
Two, three...

02:48.430 --> 02:50.519
Whatever's happened?
What's wrong with Phyllis?

02:50.520 --> 02:51.642
Oh, her back's gone again.

02:51.667 --> 02:54.042
We had to give her gas
to get her in the chair.

03:01.466 --> 03:03.746
Emergency - Ward 10.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.959
Sister Monica Joan isn't a fan,

03:05.960 --> 03:09.000
but there are some
rather handsome doctors in it.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.680
Budge up, then.

03:13.321 --> 03:15.517
Nurse Crane's diagnosis
has been confirmed

03:15.542 --> 03:18.254
as a trapped sciatic nerve.
Oh, poor lamb.

03:18.279 --> 03:20.388
That's going to mean beastly
old traction, isn't it?

03:20.413 --> 03:21.417
Yes, it is.

03:21.442 --> 03:23.531
And I've been advised
that she won't be back to work

03:23.556 --> 03:24.879
for at least six weeks.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.830
Pity the doctor that
had to tell her that.

03:26.855 --> 03:28.147
Quite.

03:29.396 --> 03:32.444
Fortunately, Mother Mildred has
promised to send one of the sisters

03:32.469 --> 03:35.079
for the duration of
Nurse Crane's absence.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.919
So, hopefully, Sister Frances,
we won't have another day

03:37.920 --> 03:39.586
quite as busy as this one.

03:39.611 --> 03:41.159
Oh, I didn't mind.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.520
I wonder who we'll get.

03:48.011 --> 03:49.971
Good morning, Mr Buckle!

03:53.329 --> 03:54.826
Mother Mildred.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.590
Good morning.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.319
We wasn't expecting you.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.627
The Almighty likes
to keep us guessing.

04:00.922 --> 04:04.064
It is why my devotion
to him never stales.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.999
Thank you.

04:08.695 --> 04:14.335
I sat at supper in the refectory
and cast my gaze from one end

04:14.360 --> 04:18.103
of the table to the other,
musing prayerfully upon

04:18.129 --> 04:21.321
the question, whom might I bequeath?

04:21.346 --> 04:23.452
Vigour is required.

04:23.653 --> 04:25.825
Expertise is required.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.278
Compassion is required.

04:28.609 --> 04:31.289
And thus, I decided
that it should be me.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.040
Besides, it's time I learnt
how our mission

04:35.065 --> 04:37.345
in the East End has evolved.

04:37.919 --> 04:41.764
Now, which of you
splendid ladies would like me

04:41.789 --> 04:44.346
to accompany her
on her morning's round?

04:50.204 --> 04:52.759
- Perhaps Sister Frances would...
- I'm too inexperienced.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.039
Indeed.

04:54.408 --> 05:00.283
If, my purpose is to learn,
I require an escort of maturity,

05:00.607 --> 05:04.487
with perhaps
some glamour for ballast?

05:08.880 --> 05:11.469
It hasn't been used a lot,
but I've spruced it up,

05:11.494 --> 05:13.679
oiled it, changed the tyres,
run it round the block,

05:13.680 --> 05:16.199
and I reckon this is just the ticket
for you, Mother Mildred.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.521
Oh, the bicycle.

05:18.962 --> 05:21.336
Curse of the short of limb.

05:22.151 --> 05:25.762
Never fear, Mr Buckle,
the Lord will provide.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.039
I see you have your van close by.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
How very fortuitous.

05:33.198 --> 05:37.760
I'm Into Something Good
by Herman's Hermits

06:24.892 --> 06:26.919
- Don't dawdle.
- Coming!

06:45.080 --> 06:48.282
Oh, good, we want the second floor,
I believe.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.107
Mother Mildred, I am a
fully qualified keep fit instructor,

06:53.353 --> 06:56.247
but even I am struggling to keep up
with an internal combustion engine.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.508
A moment, please.

06:58.860 --> 07:02.060
Of course, Nurse Franklin,
I do apologise.

07:03.218 --> 07:04.778
Anyway, erm...

07:06.640 --> 07:09.120
Brittall, Joseph, Mr.

07:10.313 --> 07:13.552
End-stage pneumoconiosis.
Poor chap.

07:13.962 --> 07:16.227
Very common among the
retired dockers, I'm afraid.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.599
It's the dust in the warehouses.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.480
Well, we must give poor Mr Brittall
and his family what comfort we can.

07:24.243 --> 07:25.723
On we go.

07:29.962 --> 07:32.401
Come along, Miss Crane,
let's be sensible.

07:32.426 --> 07:34.725
Might be storing up problems
if you don't.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.541
I am a State Registered Nurse
and a State Certified Midwife,

07:39.760 --> 07:42.999
therefore perfectly well aware
of what I may or may not

07:43.000 --> 07:44.825
be storing up, Sister.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.472
I shall let you know
when assistance is required.

07:48.497 --> 07:49.857
Thank you.

07:53.666 --> 07:56.367
Oh, actually, Sister,
when you have a moment...

07:57.440 --> 08:00.320
..might I trouble you for
the use of the telephone?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.400
Well done, Mr Brittall.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.479
Not the most dignified
of positions, I know,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.319
but it gets the circulation
going again.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.599
Ain't much dignified
in this dying business.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.399
I've seen many a patient
gasp their way

08:31.400 --> 08:33.759
to the finish line without oxygen.

08:33.760 --> 08:38.239
To be able to provide it in the
home seems almost miraculous.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.480
Mrs Brittall.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.639
It's clear your father-in-law's
in magnificent hands,

08:46.640 --> 08:47.881
I commend you.

08:47.906 --> 08:49.481
We're just glad to have him home.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.719
It's the hungry hordes already.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.342
Fags out, Grandad's on his tank.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.572
I'm telling you, one of them's
going to blow us all up

08:56.597 --> 08:58.316
one of these days.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.480
You all right, Dad?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.600
What's that for?

09:04.920 --> 09:06.310
Fell off a crate.

09:07.919 --> 09:09.719
Thought it would cheer you up.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.400
We will, see you all anon.

09:16.736 --> 09:19.175
We'll be back at the same time
tomorrow, but do telephone

09:19.200 --> 09:20.986
if you have any worries at all.

09:24.753 --> 09:25.814
Oi.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.347
Hello, Grandad,
you're looking a bit better.

09:37.964 --> 09:40.319
I think it's better not
to enquire into the provenance

09:40.320 --> 09:42.599
- of that pineapple.
- Nurse.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.487
He wants to ask you something.
Go on.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.594
I've got this thing on me neck.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.826
It was just a little nick,
but now it's...

09:50.520 --> 09:54.227
I mean, it's likely nothing.
She wanted me to ask.

09:54.252 --> 09:56.975
Oh, yes, infected.

09:57.079 --> 09:58.831
It's probably environmental.

09:59.026 --> 10:02.290
I've seen a lot of that sort of
thing in the Kowloon slums.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.144
I beg your pardon?

10:04.360 --> 10:07.279
You aren't in Kowloon now,
and my house isn't a slum!

10:07.280 --> 10:09.728
I'm quite sure Mother Mildred
wasn't implying that.

10:09.753 --> 10:11.050
I ruddy hope not.

10:11.075 --> 10:13.239
If I were you,
I'd make an appointment at the surgery.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.559
Dr Turner might
want to give you some antibiotics.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.754
Or a tin of Vim. Come on.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.541
Perhaps it's the strain
making her oversensitive.

10:29.539 --> 10:32.121
Nurse Crane has asked
for her Spanish textbooks

10:32.146 --> 10:35.291
and the manual on motor maintenance
from the public library.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.782
I have a feeling she's
in need of distraction.

10:38.807 --> 10:42.240
Perhaps our friend Cyril
could oblige with the latter.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.399
And we should let Sergeant Woolf
know that Nurse Crane

10:46.400 --> 10:47.880
won't be at Cubs.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.273
It's sweet the way they always
want to be exactly the same,

10:53.680 --> 10:55.991
right down to the colour
of the biscuit wrappers.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.826
We've been so lucky
with how well they get on.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.622
Shelagh, are you all right?

11:04.960 --> 11:07.400
Oh, I'm just being a bit silly.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.559
We've had the latest letter
from the charity,

11:11.560 --> 11:13.919
and it's good news, really.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.609
Mr Tunnocks is much improved
and should be out of

11:16.634 --> 11:18.240
the sanatorium soon.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.948
So, our next meeting will
be to start planning

11:21.973 --> 11:23.880
May's move to her permanent family.

11:25.720 --> 11:26.960
Come here.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.639
I told you I was being silly
AND selfish.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.354
It's absolutely right that May goes
to the home that was meant for her,

11:38.880 --> 11:41.278
but Angela's going
to miss her so much.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.519
Angela isn't the only one.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.635
No.

11:44.911 --> 11:48.310
Shelagh, if we have
loved that little girl,

11:48.911 --> 11:51.875
then that means we've done
what we set out to do.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.160
I hope so.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.988
I was absolutely mortified.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.880
Poor Mrs Brittall. I think Mother
Mildred was lucky to get out alive.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.277
Lucille, are you all right?
You've looked ever so

12:15.302 --> 12:17.159
- down in the dumps lately.
- Have I?

12:17.160 --> 12:20.581
Only in a delicate, subtle,
scarcely discernible sort of a way

12:20.606 --> 12:22.785
that I can pinpoint to the
exact moment you came home

12:22.810 --> 12:24.199
from your date with Cyril.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.960
I'm not going to talk about Cyril.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.080
- Why not?
- Did something go wrong?

12:30.241 --> 12:32.401
He's not the person
I thought he was.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.879
Firstly, he took me
to the most unsuitable place.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.627
A West Indian social club
where, secondly,

12:38.652 --> 12:41.012
there were several people
smoking marijuana.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.879
Was Cyril one of them?

12:43.880 --> 12:46.079
No, he wasn't.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.199
It would be a bit strange,
him being a pastor.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.559
Yes, it would.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.907
And you know the worst thing?

12:50.932 --> 12:53.087
- He isn't a pastor at all.
- What?!

12:53.112 --> 12:54.879
When I mentioned it,
he looked at me as if

12:54.880 --> 12:56.789
I had been smoking marijuana.

12:56.814 --> 12:59.531
He's hardly been to church
since he left British Guyana.

12:59.736 --> 13:01.755
The whole evening
was a total disaster

13:01.780 --> 13:03.201
and I won't be seeing him again.

13:04.787 --> 13:06.947
I have to go, I'm on night duty.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.019
- Valerie.
- Yeah.

13:12.049 --> 13:14.100
Who said that Cyril was a pastor?

13:14.125 --> 13:16.293
It was Sister Monica Joan
who told...

13:17.995 --> 13:19.084
Oh.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.609
You're up early, Fred Buckle.

13:26.112 --> 13:29.652
Yeah, I thought I'd get in sharp and
take a look at that dicky boiler

13:30.080 --> 13:32.214
before I go off with Mother Mildred.

13:32.239 --> 13:34.683
Are you remembering
about the wholesaler's?

13:35.030 --> 13:36.033
Oh.

13:36.058 --> 13:39.719
Oh, Fred, love,
you said you'd take me up there.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.386
It's three buses.

13:41.411 --> 13:44.462
I can't really say no to
Mother Mildred, can I?

13:44.487 --> 13:47.160
I mean, she's a nun and she needs
to get round to see her patients.

13:47.186 --> 13:50.339
No, I don't suppose you can.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.643
Just... don't let her
take the mickey.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.387
Mr Brittall, it could be
something called erysipelas.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.781
I'm starting you on
antibiotics as a precaution,

14:03.920 --> 14:06.505
but given your occupation,

14:06.960 --> 14:10.119
I want to get you to the hospital
for tests.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.148
Tests? For what?

14:12.173 --> 14:14.973
Well, I'd like to rule out anthrax.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.869
Bloody hell.

14:18.894 --> 14:22.285
Have you been unloading
any animal products recently?

14:22.824 --> 14:25.543
Bonemeal, skins,
anything like that?

14:25.600 --> 14:28.606
I don't know.
We get all sorts from all over.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.910
When I started on the docks,
there was this fella got anthrax.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.846
Flippin' heck, he died, that bloke.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.400
Which is why I want you
to have those tests straight away.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.203
I'm so sorry.

14:52.228 --> 14:54.907
We seem to have turned the room
into a bit of a bomb site.

14:54.932 --> 14:59.211
I accept no apologies
because no apologies are required.

14:59.236 --> 15:02.395
I relish seeing children
enjoy themselves.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.720
And the difference in little May
is quite remarkable.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.854
She's made her mark
on all of us.

15:11.879 --> 15:14.158
They do, you know.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.289
These little, scraps.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.692
They come to us as the wounded ones.

15:22.596 --> 15:26.396
But when they leave us,
it is we who bleed.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.880
Does it hurt you to let go of them?

15:32.003 --> 15:33.603
That would be telling.

15:36.831 --> 15:42.711
And, I do not tell
because my pain is not relevant.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.080
Can I help you?

16:08.323 --> 16:09.803
I'm in labour.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.399
Why don't you come in
and I'll have a look, Mrs...?

16:15.400 --> 16:18.129
Pilkington, and it's Miss.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.679
Why don't you tell me your
first name, and I'll call you that?

16:22.065 --> 16:23.465
It's Elaine.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.352
Lean on me, Elaine.

16:28.868 --> 16:30.708
You've come to the right place.

16:36.934 --> 16:38.397
Ah, Mr Buckle!

16:38.640 --> 16:40.319
Just the gentleman I want.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.908
I require transportation
to the Iris Knight Institute.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.354
I am putting my shoulder
to the mothercraft wheel!

16:47.760 --> 16:50.166
What time do you need to be there,
Mother Mildred?

16:50.191 --> 16:52.470
The instant you can oblige.

16:52.495 --> 16:53.855
Thank you.

17:00.136 --> 17:02.816
This is quite
a strong foundation garment.

17:16.090 --> 17:17.455
Anthrax.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.221
Sends a chill right through you,
doesn't it?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.977
I know this couldn't have come
at a worse time for you all.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.965
One of us will be here
every day for Joe,

17:26.991 --> 17:29.722
and if there's anything else
we can do, please just ask.

17:30.386 --> 17:32.759
You can tell that nun
not to come back for a start.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.190
- Mum!
- No! Ed, I mean it.

17:35.215 --> 17:37.009
I've got your grandad
lying in the back room,

17:37.034 --> 17:38.947
I've got your dad.
I'm up to here, love!

17:39.351 --> 17:41.759
I'm not having someone in my house
who can't even be bothered

17:41.760 --> 17:43.745
- to be polite.
- I don't think she meant to...

17:43.770 --> 17:46.214
Are you going to tell the nurse,
or do I have to do it myself?

17:54.430 --> 17:57.048
Have you had any antenatal care
at all?

17:57.320 --> 17:59.185
No, but I know that
I'm nine months gone.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.319
Your cervix is quite dilated.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.439
That means it's coming, doesn't it?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.279
It certainly does.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.454
Is there any one
you would like me to call?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.640
Your boyfriend, perhaps?

18:10.496 --> 18:12.775
- No.
- What about your parents?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.985
No!

18:14.440 --> 18:16.031
Elaine, precious...

18:16.560 --> 18:17.906
..how old are you?

18:18.259 --> 18:19.624
17.

18:32.369 --> 18:33.929
Hello, love.

18:41.074 --> 18:42.857
According to her medical records,

18:42.882 --> 18:44.799
Miss Pilkington lives
with her parents.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.148
She was adamant that
I shouldn't call them.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.135
No parents, no boyfriend.

18:50.415 --> 18:52.774
She hasn't said a word
about the baby's father.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.769
If her parents don't know
where she is, they'll be worried.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.212
The pregnancy was very well
concealed, Doctor.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.732
They might not even know
that she's expecting.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
I've had on nicer outfits.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.257
You look good to me, girl.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.320
A sight for sore eyes.

19:18.341 --> 19:19.941
Gilda...

19:21.960 --> 19:24.361
..you've been the love
of my life, girl.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.609
I want you to know that.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.137
If anything...

19:30.162 --> 19:31.672
What's all this?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.680
If nothing.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.947
You're going to be all right,
Barney Brittall.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.560
I ain't having anything else.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.735
Good girl, keep breathing.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.648
Really, really good.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.915
Now small, slow pushes.

19:58.853 --> 20:02.726
That's it, precious,
you're so near.

20:03.171 --> 20:04.651
Gently now.

20:10.444 --> 20:12.412
Baby's head is just sitting here.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.519
Now we want another push,
just like that.

20:15.544 --> 20:17.704
Slowly, slowly.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.639
Yes!

20:23.640 --> 20:26.766
Yes, I have your
baby's head in my hand.

20:33.031 --> 20:35.159
Oh, well done, Elaine.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.560
You have a beautiful daughter.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.458
Is she all right?

20:46.360 --> 20:48.519
Can I have her? Can I see her?

20:49.140 --> 20:50.680
Of course you can.

21:06.118 --> 21:07.638
My little darling.

21:09.080 --> 21:12.280
I'm never going to let you go,
never.

21:14.697 --> 21:17.216
The very accusation is absurd.

21:17.480 --> 21:21.813
Had Mrs Brittall ever been to
Kowloon, she would know full well

21:21.838 --> 21:23.711
that there could be no comparison!

21:23.736 --> 21:25.399
But she hasn't been to Kowloon,

21:25.400 --> 21:27.959
and she does know
what the word "slum" means!

21:27.960 --> 21:30.805
And whether you intended it or not,
I'm afraid you've caused offence!

21:30.830 --> 21:35.735
And whether you intended to or not,
you have waylaid a religious sister

21:35.760 --> 21:37.808
on the brink of the great silence,

21:37.884 --> 21:41.535
and caused her grave
spiritual inconvenience!

21:41.560 --> 21:44.840
- But I...
- I suggest we conclude this conversation.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.119
Would you like to put Sarah
in the cot while you have

22:07.120 --> 22:10.096
some tea and toast?
Mums need to keep their strength up.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.120
In a minute, maybe.

22:19.285 --> 22:20.565
Elaine?

22:22.181 --> 22:24.501
Sarah isn't your first baby, is she?

22:26.755 --> 22:29.177
You had some stitches last time.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.480
I saw the scar
when I was delivering her.

22:38.669 --> 22:40.549
They took him away from me.

22:43.242 --> 22:44.762
I didn't say goodbye.

22:46.877 --> 22:49.492
They told me they were taking
him to see a doctor.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.040
I never saw him again.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.720
We don't do things, like that here.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.200
I promise you.

23:02.919 --> 23:04.918
But you're going
to need to make a plan.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.356
Your parents don't know
you're here, do they?

23:09.360 --> 23:13.239
I told them I was staying
with a friend, Etta.

23:13.240 --> 23:16.187
Think how worried they'll be when
you don't come back in the morning.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.640
We're going to have
to let them know.

23:22.563 --> 23:23.723
Elaine?

23:28.632 --> 23:30.261
You can let them know.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.200
But make sure they know this too -
I ain't giving Sarah up.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.079
He had a bad night.

23:50.247 --> 23:51.974
Agitated, you know?

23:52.760 --> 23:54.614
Hasn't been able to say much today.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.479
- Any better?
- Yeah.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.906
What are you two doing back?

24:02.297 --> 24:05.648
Our wharf shut down. They've got
to check for more anthrax.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.799
- Seven quid back pay.
- Blimey!

24:08.800 --> 24:10.999
Well, at least
they're taking it seriously.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.811
Do they even know what
they're looking for?

24:12.836 --> 24:14.755
Infected bonemeal from the Lebanon.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.173
They've got the
actual cargo out, but...

24:17.640 --> 24:19.847
..it could've spread anywhere,
so they've got to check.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.840
Is anyone else sick?

24:24.768 --> 24:26.034
Only Dad.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.840
I don't understand, Sissy.

24:42.520 --> 24:44.920
Our Elaine didn't look
any different, did she?

24:46.240 --> 24:47.440
I mean...

24:48.636 --> 24:51.075
..I thought she'd gone
up to a B cup.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.679
But, you know, she's 17!

24:53.680 --> 24:56.839
Sometimes, when a woman really wants
to conceal a pregnancy,

24:56.840 --> 24:59.186
she finds a way, Mrs Pilkington.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.560
Where did we go wrong?

25:02.920 --> 25:05.216
She was a well-brought-up
young lady, Doctor.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.519
Sunday school, church.

25:08.076 --> 25:09.959
We taught her right from wrong.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.680
- I'm sure you did.
- The deception!

25:14.120 --> 25:16.720
Lying to us for a whole nine months.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.719
Well, thank you, Doctor,
for letting us know.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.639
We'll take care of things this end.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.680
I understand Elaine relinquished
a baby when she was 15?

25:29.688 --> 25:31.434
Oh, look, it's all right,
love, come on.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.114
We'll get through this.

25:34.404 --> 25:37.399
We've still got the number
from the agency, don't we?

25:37.400 --> 25:39.781
The thing is, Mr Pilkington,

25:39.894 --> 25:43.254
this time Elaine seems determined
to keep her baby.

25:47.310 --> 25:51.687
Well, unless she has herself
a husband tucked away somewhere,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.320
that just isn't going to happen.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.760
Have you seen these from the Cubs?

26:06.960 --> 26:09.760
I suppose it's the
thought that counts.

26:13.674 --> 26:17.233
Oh! Did the master mechanic
deliver those to our doors?

26:17.480 --> 26:19.629
Such an able young man!

26:19.920 --> 26:22.907
If you mean Cyril,
I'm afraid I can't help you there.

26:25.476 --> 26:27.079
Sister Monica Joan?

26:27.640 --> 26:28.754
Lucille thought...

26:28.779 --> 26:32.658
Well, we all thought,
that Cyril was a pastor.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.584
Oh, but he is.

26:34.609 --> 26:36.083
No, he is not.

26:37.092 --> 26:38.611
So the thing is...

26:39.120 --> 26:41.279
..Lucille doesn't know
if she can trust him.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.168
She doesn't know
if he told a porky...

26:45.027 --> 26:46.947
..or if someone else did.

26:48.281 --> 26:49.549
Oh.

26:50.974 --> 26:55.478
One did not necessarily mean
pastor in the literal sense.

26:58.317 --> 27:02.667
To operate solely on the plane of
the literal would be tedious

27:03.280 --> 27:05.880
and would blind one
to a greater truth.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.200
What I meant,
my dear Nurse Anderson,

27:10.560 --> 27:15.851
is that I had looked into his eyes
and seen the soul of a pastor,

27:16.280 --> 27:18.378
which is far more important.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.320
So, Cyril didn't lie to me?

27:23.406 --> 27:25.765
These might make hospital teas
a little more palatable

27:25.790 --> 27:28.839
for Nurse Crane.
Nurse Dyer, your grandmother rang.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.295
Oh! She'll be getting cross
because I haven't been to see her

27:31.320 --> 27:33.335
- for a couple of weeks.
- When you go, she did ask

27:33.360 --> 27:35.034
if you could bring your medical bag.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.517
Oh.

27:46.534 --> 27:47.813
I won't do it.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.733
And how could they even...?

27:51.560 --> 27:53.759
They're supposed to be
the people that love me.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.639
Oh, Elaine, I'm sure they do.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.446
They probably just think that,
in the circumstances...

27:59.471 --> 28:02.121
Sarah wasn't an accident,
Mrs Turner.

28:02.608 --> 28:03.967
I wanted her.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.174
I wanted her so badly!

28:06.800 --> 28:09.359
It was like they ripped out my heart
when they took

28:09.360 --> 28:10.735
away my little boy. And now...

28:12.000 --> 28:14.694
..every time I look at her,
I can feel it beating again.

28:16.053 --> 28:18.097
Could Sarah's father help you?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.919
I don't even know where he lives.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.555
And I know it wasn't about him.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.840
I just wanted a baby!

28:27.080 --> 28:29.079
I'm sorry.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.399
You're probably shocked.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.960
It wasn't like this the first time.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.061
I would have gone to the ends
of the Earth for Benjamin's dad,

28:41.960 --> 28:43.998
even though he didn't want
to know about the baby.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.840
No-one did.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.159
And now he's out there
somewhere, growing up,

28:50.160 --> 28:53.072
- thinking I didn't want him either.
- Oh, Elaine.

28:53.097 --> 28:56.335
I'm sure wherever he is,
he will be loved so much.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.934
You can't know that!

28:58.360 --> 29:00.640
No, of course not, it's just...

29:02.520 --> 29:05.959
I'm not sure if this
will help, but...

29:05.960 --> 29:09.461
..we adopted our daughter
and we love her with every fibre

29:09.486 --> 29:10.731
of our being.

29:11.461 --> 29:12.777
You're right.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.645
That doesn't help me.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.120
No, I'm sorry.

29:28.981 --> 29:30.190
Gran!

29:30.960 --> 29:32.349
Still alive, then?

29:36.199 --> 29:39.078
Yeah, I'm sorry I haven't been around
for a bit, time just runs away...

29:39.219 --> 29:41.659
I'm kidding with you, darling!

29:43.693 --> 29:44.693
Oh.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.039
You always look so smart
in that uniform.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.108
- Want a cup of tea?
- Well, I'll make it.

29:50.133 --> 29:51.981
You sit down, tell me what's wrong.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.200
I can't sit down,
that's the problem.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.086
Like a Whitstable bloody oyster.

30:02.183 --> 30:03.823
Oh!

30:04.960 --> 30:06.440
Oh, Gran!

30:11.320 --> 30:14.600
There's er, someone here
to see you, Mum.

30:19.213 --> 30:21.795
I told Nurse Franklin
I didn't want you here again.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.879
This is your home, Mrs Brittall,
and if you will not admit me,

30:27.294 --> 30:30.072
I will respect that and leave...

30:31.051 --> 30:33.851
the moment I have
offered my apologies.

30:40.447 --> 30:43.327
Mind me floor.
I've not long scrubbed it.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.560
Oh, this is a nasty one, Gran.

30:54.737 --> 30:56.156
That's it.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.784
- I'm just going to bathe it in antiseptic.
- Ta, darling.

31:01.706 --> 31:02.911
It might sting a bit.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.320
Oh! Sorry.

31:09.003 --> 31:10.981
You know, you really should've
gone to the doctor.

31:11.005 --> 31:13.860
I ain't flashing my pins
for no-one.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.479
If any more come up
or this one doesn't heal,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.496
you have got to promise me
you'll go to the doctor.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.109
How many backsides
do you think he's seen?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.532
I'm telling you,
he won't even notice it.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.699
All doctors think about
are the ill bits.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.479
Do you promise me?

31:34.958 --> 31:36.438
All right. All right.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.040
Oh, no, don't touch them!

31:42.360 --> 31:44.057
It's all the work clothes.

31:44.223 --> 31:47.982
Nurse Franklin told me to boil-wash
them in case there were any spores.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.624
Any infected bloody bonemeal.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.519
Aren't they provided with overalls?

31:53.520 --> 31:54.710
Who by?

31:55.040 --> 31:57.044
The bosses? No!

31:57.320 --> 32:00.719
The men, they wear their own shirts,
their own slacks,

32:01.160 --> 32:03.667
an old suit jacket
that's seen better days.

32:03.692 --> 32:04.944
That's appalling!

32:06.724 --> 32:08.048
Why Barney, eh?

32:09.384 --> 32:12.382
His dad's already dying
because of the job he did.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.960
What have my sons
got coming to get them?

32:28.600 --> 32:30.079
Any news on the new flat?

32:30.104 --> 32:32.256
It's getting to be a bit
of a ghost town round here.

32:32.281 --> 32:36.095
Well, they rehouse
the families first, don't they?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.319
Fair enough, really.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.549
Could be soon, though.

32:40.574 --> 32:42.734
There's only a few of us left.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.129
Don't forget to take your
ice cream money when you go.

32:53.154 --> 32:55.696
I don't need money, Gran!
I've got a job!

32:55.721 --> 32:56.890
Oh, come on!

32:57.322 --> 32:59.721
You and your cousins always
had money for ice cream

32:59.746 --> 33:01.444
on your way home.

33:01.535 --> 33:03.094
You ain't forgotten, have you?

33:03.709 --> 33:04.852
Of course not.

33:05.798 --> 33:06.811
Go on.

33:07.317 --> 33:09.757
Help yourself.
You know where it is.

33:13.374 --> 33:15.133
Take ten shillings.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.280
I will not.
I will take two bob and no more.

33:26.464 --> 33:28.144
You did all right, girl.

33:32.754 --> 33:34.394
Thanks, Gran.

33:38.307 --> 33:39.663
Val?

33:40.760 --> 33:42.360
Don't be a stranger.

33:48.373 --> 33:49.893
Thank you, May.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.102
You can go and play
with your toys, May,

34:00.127 --> 34:01.999
if you're fed up with
the grown-ups talking.

34:04.695 --> 34:07.193
She's come a long way in the time
that she's been here.

34:07.758 --> 34:10.944
It's going to be quite a wrench
for all of us when she goes.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.960
Yes, I'm sure it must be difficult
not to get attached.

34:16.627 --> 34:20.172
Mrs Taylor, we want to do
the very best we can to ease

34:20.197 --> 34:22.090
May into her new family.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.884
Can you recommend
anything that will help?

34:25.400 --> 34:28.322
She's had to cope with so
many changes in her life already,

34:28.348 --> 34:29.639
and she's only four.

34:29.639 --> 34:32.359
Well, I think seeing that
pony in the Tunnocks' paddock

34:32.360 --> 34:33.926
will be of some assistance.

34:35.188 --> 34:37.588
Look, it's best not to make a fuss.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.559
Children are resilient.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.914
And, in the long run, memories of
this age will be very hazy.

34:42.938 --> 34:44.152
Really?

34:44.960 --> 34:48.255
I remember falling out
of my cot when I was two.

34:48.280 --> 34:51.679
Trust me, Dr Turner,
I have done this before.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.313
We're back at barracks,
Mother Mildred.

35:16.421 --> 35:20.040
I've been contemplating
the plight of the two Mr Brittalls.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.479
The dock workers have
no protective clothing

35:23.480 --> 35:26.040
and no knowledge
of the goods they handle.

35:27.204 --> 35:30.450
A couple of years ago,
my cousin's lad

35:30.475 --> 35:32.705
was carrying ammunition.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.879
He didn't have a clue
what it was, until a crate

35:35.880 --> 35:37.879
hit the ground and it went up
like Guy Fawkes.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.026
It was a miracle no-one was killed.

35:41.160 --> 35:44.119
If 50 years in the religious life
have taught me anything,

35:44.120 --> 35:46.429
it's that miracles
are in very short supply.

35:46.454 --> 35:48.934
We had better not rely on them.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.053
The childcare officer
seemed to think

35:54.078 --> 35:56.967
that May won't mind being
handed over like a parcel.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.359
I mean, I know she's
going to a lovely home,

36:00.722 --> 36:02.203
but she's four years old.

36:03.754 --> 36:08.506
She's already lost her mother,
her country, her language.

36:09.576 --> 36:12.535
If we just disappear as well,
how will she understand

36:12.560 --> 36:14.869
that the same thing
won't happen to her new family?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.197
Is there anything
you can do to help?

36:19.243 --> 36:22.080
That's what I was hoping the
childcare officer could help with.

36:23.626 --> 36:27.185
She seemed to think you
could just rub out the past,

36:27.320 --> 36:30.119
which doesn't make
a lot of sense to me,

36:30.120 --> 36:32.680
especially after seeing
Elaine Pilkington.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.302
Trust your instincts, Shelagh.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.771
- You all right, Val?

36:44.796 --> 36:46.464
- You all right, Bill?
- Yeah.

37:18.798 --> 37:21.248
Cor blimey, all right!

37:21.760 --> 37:23.039
Oh.

37:23.219 --> 37:24.639
Good morning, Mr Buckle.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.508
I come as Boadicea,
girded for battle.

37:27.736 --> 37:29.924
Dare I presume my chariot awaits?

37:29.949 --> 37:32.639
Who's that ringing the bell
at this time in the morning?!

37:32.640 --> 37:34.360
It's all right, love, it's for me.

37:51.062 --> 37:55.901
All I know is that the dock has
been closed until further notice.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.159
I'm sorry, lads!

37:58.160 --> 37:59.799
My hands are tied!

37:59.800 --> 38:03.239
The men want to know when,
Mr McGregor.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.079
Well said, Pete.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.446
I don't know when.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.696
Come back and see tomorrow.

38:09.721 --> 38:12.001
I can't say anything else!

38:17.568 --> 38:21.287
Ah! Greetings, Mr Brittall
and Mr Brittall.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.831
- Has something happened?
- No, no, all is well.

38:23.943 --> 38:26.931
I'm hoping to confer
with Mr McGregor.

38:27.545 --> 38:28.658
I think we all are.

38:28.736 --> 38:30.340
Might have to get
in the queue, Sister.

38:30.364 --> 38:33.143
Your members want
to get back to work - so do I.

38:33.168 --> 38:35.479
If you had listened to my members
in the first place...

38:35.480 --> 38:36.879
Good morning, gentlemen.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.346
Good morning, Sister.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.652
Mother.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.043
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

38:44.400 --> 38:48.199
As you're aware, one of your workers
is gravely ill in hospital

38:48.200 --> 38:49.679
with anthrax poisoning.

38:49.680 --> 38:55.580
Meanwhile, his father is dying
at home of pneumoconiosis.

38:55.605 --> 38:58.159
Both might have been prevented
with proper clothing,

38:58.160 --> 39:00.079
equipment and information.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.804
Have you been talking to him?

39:02.540 --> 39:04.719
Do you advise me to?

39:05.360 --> 39:07.759
Peter Jessop, Dockers' Union.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.400
Shop steward.

39:12.736 --> 39:14.844
Do you have an appointment
with Dr Turner

39:14.869 --> 39:16.616
or are you here
for the maternity home?

39:16.641 --> 39:19.689
Erm, the second one.

39:20.054 --> 39:22.494
Erm, patient name of Pilkington.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.826
Oh, yes, Miss Pilkington.

39:29.052 --> 39:33.822
We're going to try to help you stop
all this nonsense with men.

39:34.017 --> 39:35.559
Put it all behind us, eh?

39:35.560 --> 39:38.301
- Your mother's spoken with the agency...
- No!

39:38.800 --> 39:41.319
No, I told them to tell you
I'm not giving her up.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.761
Don't be silly, love.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.259
Marriage is the place
for babies, Elaine.

39:46.613 --> 39:47.935
You know that.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.999
We've got a business,
decent people as customers.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.959
We can't go waving
this in their faces!

39:54.240 --> 39:55.839
Someone's woken up very hungry.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.580
- Oh, dear!
- Dad!

39:57.605 --> 40:01.241
Can't you just... give her a bottle
somewhere else, Nurse?

40:01.266 --> 40:02.994
Why won't you look at her?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.559
- She's your granddaughter!
- No, she isn't.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.439
She is, Dad!

40:07.440 --> 40:09.774
Her name is Sarah
and she's beautiful.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.421
Please.
I'm not going home without her.

40:13.446 --> 40:15.073
I've had enough of this nonsense.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.520
No-one can say I haven't tried.

40:25.875 --> 40:28.207
No, Mum.
Mum, please don't go.

40:28.277 --> 40:30.477
Mum, I love you. Mum!

40:30.502 --> 40:32.516
- Mummy!
- Oh, precious.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.486
Oh!

40:51.699 --> 40:54.738
Dust really does go straight down
the pipes, doesn't it?

40:54.840 --> 40:57.319
Which is why a lot of our members
have got lungs of wood,

40:57.320 --> 40:58.879
like old Joe Brittall.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.251
Now, sometimes, you can guess
the cargo by how it feels

41:01.276 --> 41:04.295
on your chest, and the fibres
on your clothes.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.987
Have you never asked
for any protective clothing?

41:07.360 --> 41:09.588
We went on strike in '62.

41:10.220 --> 41:13.579
We wanted for overalls
and gloves and masks.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.319
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.879
And then, this year, we thought we'd
got a bit of victory.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.600
We got these.

41:21.808 --> 41:24.287
A bit of tin and a bit of gauze.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.340
They clog up in 20 minutes flat.

41:26.365 --> 41:27.740
They're useless.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.881
I'm nearly 65.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.887
I wish I was retiring with something
more to show for it than that.

41:35.048 --> 41:39.815
Well, perhaps your legacy will leave
something for the next generation

41:39.840 --> 41:41.205
to build on.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.375
I didn't know nuns were
interested in politics.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.360
Mr Jessop, nuns are interested
in morality.

41:52.280 --> 41:56.440
Elaine, you can't support a baby on
your own with no family around you.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.279
It would be so hard.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.303
There was a girl in a
mother-and-baby home that kept hers.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.959
She got a place in a hostel
and National Assistance.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.039
That is very little money
to get you by.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.999
I've got a good typing speed.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.935
And there's piecework
you can do at home,

42:11.960 --> 42:13.777
envelopes for mail orders and that.

42:14.313 --> 42:16.716
I've had nine months
to think about it, Nurse.

42:17.705 --> 42:19.321
I know it will be hard, but...

42:21.920 --> 42:24.480
..nothing can be as hard
as what I've already done.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.759
Now, there is an
organisation called

42:29.760 --> 42:32.239
the National Council
for the Unmarried Mother.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.873
They might be able to help.

42:34.560 --> 42:37.281
But she's only 17 and totally alone.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.537
She'll spend her whole life
struggling and facing disapproval.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.777
Should we be encouraging her
to do that?

42:44.040 --> 42:47.418
I don't think our encouragement
is here nor there, Nurse Anderson.

42:47.820 --> 42:50.901
Young Elaine only has
two possible roads to go down.

42:51.304 --> 42:53.864
She's choosing the one she can bear.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.120
He used to be such a big man,
just like my dad.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.880
It's a very cruel disease.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.605
Mum's scared for me and our John.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.213
She doesn't want us working down
the docks no more.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.969
What do you want, Ed?

43:15.320 --> 43:16.632
I don't want to leave.

43:17.280 --> 43:21.747
It's hard graft, but you're busy
and you have a laugh.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.373
Good money, too,
when you're working.

43:26.227 --> 43:29.937
You know, it's father to son,
ain't it?

43:30.840 --> 43:31.958
Mmm.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.432
Giving up would be like abandoning
one of our own.

43:36.440 --> 43:37.640
I had this...

43:38.800 --> 43:40.360
..stupid idea that...

43:43.400 --> 43:47.039
Well, instead of leaving,
I'd stand for shop steward

43:47.040 --> 43:48.887
when Peter Jessop retires.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.439
Why is that a stupid idea?

43:51.440 --> 43:52.653
Too young.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.863
- Who'd vote for a 21-year-old?
- Why not?

43:56.320 --> 44:00.445
You're intelligent, forthright, and
when it comes to arguing for

44:00.470 --> 44:04.631
better protection, your experience
gives you moral authority.

44:05.040 --> 44:09.540
I'd vote for you myself,
had life placed me differently.

44:14.106 --> 44:15.786
Do you mind if I join you?

44:17.720 --> 44:19.120
No, please.

44:28.769 --> 44:31.089
I've come to apologise
for calling you a liar.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.040
I'm so sorry.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.480
Sister Monica Joan thinks it counts
if you're a pastor on the inside.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.039
Why would she think...?

44:48.040 --> 44:52.231
Because she likes you,
because she knows I go to church.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.508
Because she knows you're the
kind of woman who does not approve

44:55.533 --> 44:56.960
of smoking marijuana.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.492
That, too.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.186
Well, I'm the kind of man
who does not approve either.

45:03.840 --> 45:07.880
But, you know, there are other
reasons to go to a social club.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.853
I'm in a new country.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.668
I get homesick for the music.

45:16.754 --> 45:20.221
And for not being the only person
in the room who looks like me.

45:23.471 --> 45:25.351
I get homesick for that, too.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.779
It's one of the things
I like about my church.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.440
Is it a friendly place?

45:37.880 --> 45:39.480
A very friendly place.

45:40.474 --> 45:42.594
Maybe one Sunday
you'd like to come along?

45:57.880 --> 46:00.599
Oh, Fred, love, not again.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.279
You've got to ask her for some
petrol money, and they should be

46:03.280 --> 46:05.828
paying you for
all these extra hours.

46:05.853 --> 46:08.575
- Oh, love, it doesn't matter.
- It does, love.

46:08.600 --> 46:11.040
Just because she's a nun,
it doesn't mean to say

46:11.065 --> 46:12.955
that she won't take advantage.

46:16.160 --> 46:20.039
I managed to negotiate
a compassionate temporary discharge

46:20.040 --> 46:23.169
for Barney Brittall
so he can see his father.

46:23.512 --> 46:25.300
Is Joe Brittall very near the end?

46:27.132 --> 46:30.131
Barney, meanwhile,
appears to be giving anthrax

46:30.156 --> 46:31.935
quite the run for its money.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.479
He will recover in due course.

46:34.480 --> 46:37.799
Well, at least that news
will be a comfort to the family.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.325
One would hope so.

46:40.282 --> 46:43.679
Mr Buckle is poised
to transport me to the scene.

46:43.680 --> 46:47.160
If it's Fred you're looking for,
he's at the petrol station,

46:47.185 --> 46:49.746
and whilst he's there,
we need to have a word.

46:49.861 --> 46:51.682
Preferably in your office.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.480
Morning, Miss Higgins.

47:03.338 --> 47:05.898
No. Sir, excuse me,
we're not open yet.

47:14.225 --> 47:19.975
The trouble is, Mother Mildred,
my Fred is a very kind man,

47:20.000 --> 47:25.515
and I wouldn't have him any other
way, but, he's generous to a fault.

47:25.540 --> 47:30.301
He struggles to say no to anyone,
and when it comes to nuns,

47:30.326 --> 47:31.661
he's hopeless.

47:31.940 --> 47:34.579
He's been the most immense
support to me

47:34.604 --> 47:37.163
and my work with the dockers
and their rights.

47:37.379 --> 47:38.959
What about HIS rights?

47:38.960 --> 47:40.787
He has to earn a living, too.

47:40.812 --> 47:42.692
He shouldn't be exploited.

47:44.718 --> 47:47.358
Have I made another
error of judgment?

47:48.782 --> 47:52.695
Nurse Crane usually delivers
a weekly mileage chit

47:52.720 --> 47:54.295
for her petrol expenditure.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.619
Would that be an
acceptable solution?

47:58.040 --> 48:01.062
Well, it gets us halfway there.

48:01.087 --> 48:02.599
I mean, what about his time?

48:02.600 --> 48:05.400
Appropriate recompense
can be arranged.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.560
Hmm.

48:17.200 --> 48:21.120
And no telling him I came round
here, because he'd be mortified.

48:26.489 --> 48:28.888
I'm sorry, Mother Mildred.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.880
I came here to learn
and I'm learning every day.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.472
Well, that's that, I suppose.

48:40.247 --> 48:41.687
I'm so sorry, Elaine.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.080
At least it's got new ribbon.

48:50.054 --> 48:52.399
I'm going to need to make
some of those cards to put in the

48:52.400 --> 48:54.015
shop windows and that.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.200
Then people that need
typing done can contact me.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.600
Once I know where I'm going to be.

49:01.930 --> 49:03.596
Let me see if I can help with that.

49:15.238 --> 49:16.718
How are you doing, Joe, love?

49:20.720 --> 49:22.480
A little water, Mr Brittall.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.348
Keep talking, Mrs Brittall.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.680
The hearing is the last thing to go.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.992
Pete Jessop was asking
for you, Grandad.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.303
Wasn't he, Ed?

49:47.960 --> 49:49.559
Yeah.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.960
Yeah, he said you was the strongest
man on the wharf when he started.

49:56.847 --> 49:58.875
Hang on in there, love.

49:58.936 --> 50:00.890
Barney's coming.

50:04.134 --> 50:05.694
That's him.

50:08.665 --> 50:10.225
Look who's here, Grandad.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.680
Dad's home.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.800
Hello, Dad.

50:33.933 --> 50:36.173
They let me out for good behaviour.

50:43.841 --> 50:46.480
They had a list of
sympathetic landladies

50:46.898 --> 50:49.158
from the
Council of Unmarried Mothers.

50:49.664 --> 50:51.956
I thought this one
sounded about the best.

50:52.198 --> 50:55.078
She's got a space
and she's not too far away.

50:56.920 --> 51:00.350
Miss Higgins says to warn you
it won't be Buckingham Palace,

51:00.375 --> 51:02.572
but it will be much nicer
than a hostel.

51:03.344 --> 51:05.623
She's all right about Sarah?

51:05.720 --> 51:07.593
Yes, she is.

51:08.280 --> 51:11.879
You'll qualify for National
Assistance until she's five,

51:11.880 --> 51:14.801
which should cover the
rent and the bare essentials.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.560
Oh, I don't know what to say.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.520
Thank you so much.

51:22.148 --> 51:23.719
I thought you might try and make me

51:23.720 --> 51:25.667
go back to that
mother-and-baby home.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.920
It's not going to be easy, Elaine.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.520
I know.

51:33.320 --> 51:36.960
But at least you can get started on
these little advertisement cards.

52:23.600 --> 52:27.519
Rest eternal
Grant unto him, oh Lord

52:27.520 --> 52:30.480
And let light perpetual
shine upon him

52:31.922 --> 52:34.478
May he rest in peace

52:35.132 --> 52:37.330
And rise in glory.

53:00.486 --> 53:02.599
If I miss a bit,
are you going to arrest me?

53:02.600 --> 53:04.199
Oh, you're doing well.

53:06.280 --> 53:07.568
Ah!

53:08.200 --> 53:10.559
Could you please give these
to Nurse Crane

53:10.560 --> 53:13.473
with my warmest wishes
for her speedy recovery?

53:13.880 --> 53:16.800
Thank you, Sergeant Woolf,
I'm sure she'll be delighted.

53:19.932 --> 53:22.557
My gift is my presence.

53:23.160 --> 53:25.497
I don't like attending hospitals.

53:25.840 --> 53:28.719
I have only had
one positive experience.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.946
I'm sure Nurse Crane
will appreciate that, too.

53:31.320 --> 53:32.620
Send her my best.

53:40.840 --> 53:44.703
I'm going to go with them so I may
not be here when you finish.

53:45.069 --> 53:46.949
Oh, thank you, Sister.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.074
Sister?

53:53.453 --> 53:55.916
I think you've made a mistake.
I don't think this one's mine.

53:55.940 --> 53:57.300
No mistake, Fred.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.600
Mind how you go.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.560
Tell the boys, mate.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.880
Thank you. Cheers.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.328
I've got enough nominations
to stand.

54:45.193 --> 54:46.949
John wants to help me.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.760
Dad, too.

54:50.552 --> 54:52.170
I won't do it if you say no.

54:53.513 --> 54:56.472
I just wanted something safer
for my sons.

54:56.741 --> 55:00.665
Well, then, I'll make it safer,
for everyone's sons.

55:01.750 --> 55:03.470
Maybe even my own some day.

55:06.682 --> 55:09.242
Oh. How can I stop you doing that,
then, eh?

56:10.560 --> 56:14.839
So, where in the end do we belong?

56:14.840 --> 56:20.119
In the eyes of another,
where we see ourselves reflected?

56:20.120 --> 56:25.839
Or arm in arm, with those
whose faces echo ours,

56:25.840 --> 56:27.813
whose blood we share?

56:28.400 --> 56:32.114
Or is it in the heart
of the family we create,

56:32.547 --> 56:37.534
where we are safest
and best known and never lonely?

56:38.979 --> 56:42.738
Perhaps we belong where
love can bloom,

56:43.345 --> 56:46.307
because we give it room
to put down roots

56:46.880 --> 56:49.440
and space in which to thrive.

56:51.600 --> 56:56.108
Seeds fly in upon the wind
and settle where they will.

56:57.492 --> 56:59.741
We all belong somewhere.

57:00.774 --> 57:06.279
If we're not nurtured as we should
be, we must find a choice to make,

57:06.280 --> 57:08.317
a place to go,

57:08.342 --> 57:11.342
a harbour where the storm
is held at bay.

57:17.840 --> 57:21.281
Sometimes simply belonging
to each other is enough,

57:22.120 --> 57:27.560
and what matters is not to struggle
but where we find our peace.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.287
From tomorrow morning,
your name will be on the call board.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.824
A Brook Advisory Centre
would be a boon to Poplar.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.719
Come my big day...

57:46.720 --> 57:48.999
Ooh, as simple as that.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.959
Run, Miss Packer.

57:50.984 --> 57:53.669
It's my waterworks,
I want to go for a wee.
