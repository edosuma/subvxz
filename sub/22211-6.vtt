<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

00:01.849 --> 00:04.481
<i>Will it be for saving the world twice?</i>

00:04.517 --> 00:05.850
<i>Nope.</i>

00:05.886 --> 00:07.652
<i>We're the team who broke time.</i>

00:07.654 --> 00:09.187
<i>That's right.</i>

00:09.189 --> 00:11.056
<i>History has been torn to shreds,</i>

00:11.058 --> 00:12.857
<i>which means it's up to us</i>

00:12.859 --> 00:16.014
<i>to put it back together
again piece by piece,</i>

00:16.050 --> 00:18.311
<i>fixing these so-called Anachronisms</i>

00:18.347 --> 00:20.131
<i>before we get torn to shreds.</i>

00:20.167 --> 00:23.335
<i>So, please, don't call us heroes.</i>

00:23.337 --> 00:25.537
<i>We're legends.</i>

00:25.539 --> 00:27.539
<i>Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:27.541 --> 00:30.709
I would kill you, but I'd
just be killing myself.

00:30.711 --> 00:33.111
I want to break up Firestorm
so that you can you go home.

00:33.113 --> 00:34.813
When do we start?

00:34.815 --> 00:37.115
<i>Please allow me to introduce</i>
<i>Madame Eleanor.</i>

00:37.117 --> 00:39.517
<i>We have to stop Damien Darhk</i>
<i>from coming back to life.</i>

00:39.519 --> 00:41.753
Stop this abomination.

00:41.755 --> 00:43.455
<i>You're too late.</i>

00:47.761 --> 00:49.361
I remember everything.

00:49.363 --> 00:50.495
Let's go.

00:53.467 --> 00:56.034
_

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.954 --> 01:16.187
You. You there.

01:16.223 --> 01:19.707
Yeah, you don't belong here.
You're supposed to be on Stage 12.

01:19.743 --> 01:22.139
We're about to roll, and Mr.
Coleson's already in a real mood.

01:22.175 --> 01:23.665
We already have one actress
gumming the works.

01:23.701 --> 01:25.482
I can't have extras wandering off, too.

01:28.609 --> 01:30.448
We should've been rolling
half an hour ago.

01:31.229 --> 01:32.418
Where the hell's my star?

01:32.454 --> 01:34.700
Ms. LaMarr is still in makeup.

01:34.724 --> 01:36.087
You got to be kidding me.

01:36.307 --> 01:38.264
How long does it take a tomato
like that to put her face on?

01:38.300 --> 01:41.019
She's playing Helen of Troy,
not Marie Antoinette.

01:48.149 --> 01:52.551
Holy cannoli, who is that?

01:59.660 --> 02:00.935
That's it.

02:02.129 --> 02:04.296
That look right there.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.887
Can you do that on cue?

02:09.136 --> 02:10.401
Forget Hedy...

02:10.404 --> 02:12.171
This is our star.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.875
What's your name, sweetheart?

02:14.675 --> 02:15.982
I'm Helen.

02:16.243 --> 02:18.047
Helen of Troy.

02:18.322 --> 02:20.099
You are now, toots.

02:20.815 --> 02:24.520
"The face that sold a million tickets."

02:25.878 --> 02:27.623
All right, people, let's roll!

02:37.570 --> 02:38.947
Oh, hey, Sara.

02:38.949 --> 02:41.183
Sara, I've been searching
for more outliers

02:41.185 --> 02:43.024
in the hopes of finding Darhk
and his witchy friend.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.504
You think having a
supercomputer would helpful.

02:45.506 --> 02:47.306
<i>Watch yourself, Mr. Heywood.</i>

02:47.308 --> 02:49.541
Anyways, there's no sign
of them in the timeline.

02:52.646 --> 02:54.379
What is that smell?

02:54.381 --> 02:56.014
Okay, full disclosure,

02:56.016 --> 02:57.416
I haven't left the library
in seven days, I think.

02:57.418 --> 03:00.419
Is it Tuesday? I'm not really sure.

03:00.421 --> 03:02.488
It's hard for me to keep track
of time in a temporal zone.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.156
Shower. Now.

03:04.158 --> 03:05.891
Okay. I'll shower after I find Darhk.

03:05.893 --> 03:07.626
I know how much it means
to you to find him.

03:07.628 --> 03:09.361
Look, we're gonna put Darhk
back in the ground

03:09.363 --> 03:11.096
where he belongs, but not like this.

03:11.098 --> 03:12.831
- Not like what?
- Not like Rip.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.967
He lost perspective,
and he got his team killed.

03:14.969 --> 03:16.802
I'm not going to be
that kind of captain.

03:16.804 --> 03:18.704
But I am the kind
of captain that tells you

03:18.706 --> 03:20.038
to clean yourself up.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.262
Okay?

03:21.675 --> 03:23.075
Aye, aye.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.910
Thanks to your research, Marty,

03:24.912 --> 03:27.312
the nanites I injected
into your bloodstreams

03:27.314 --> 03:29.348
should be locking
onto your respective halves

03:29.350 --> 03:30.791
of the Firestorm Matrix.

03:30.826 --> 03:33.268
I'm only hoping that
the polymer I constructed

03:33.293 --> 03:35.271
is strong enough to transfer...

03:35.302 --> 03:36.629
your half...

03:36.893 --> 03:38.328
from you to him.

03:38.369 --> 03:40.242
Well, a little too much
"should" and "hoping"

03:40.263 --> 03:41.967
for my comfort, but then...

03:42.092 --> 03:45.911
What is science if not the
exploration of the unknown?

03:45.968 --> 03:48.306
Ray, I'm telling you
right now, if you kill me,

03:48.308 --> 03:49.908
I'm gonna haunt you forever.

03:49.910 --> 03:52.143
Well, just remember, this was your idea.

03:52.145 --> 03:53.708
If you guys are getting cold feet,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.545
- we can call the whole thing off.
- Absolutely not.

03:55.553 --> 03:57.336
We proceed with courage and confidence.

03:57.349 --> 03:59.295
It's time for Jefferson to claim

03:59.316 --> 04:01.715
the power of Firestorm for himself.

04:01.722 --> 04:03.169
I appreciate that, man.

04:03.294 --> 04:05.790
But come on, admit it, you're
gonna miss this a little.

04:05.915 --> 04:08.908
- I mean, being a superhero, saving time.
- Not at all.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.652
Were it not for this affliction,

04:10.678 --> 04:13.450
my adventuring days would
be long behind me by now.

04:13.575 --> 04:15.830
Time travel is a young man's game.

04:15.897 --> 04:20.110
I'm eager to close this
chapter and embrace the next.

04:20.446 --> 04:22.882
Well, let's set this old man free.

04:23.007 --> 04:25.722
Uh, Ray, let's do it.

04:26.161 --> 04:27.390
All right.

04:27.942 --> 04:28.944
Here goes.

04:36.069 --> 04:38.289
Whoa. Hey, what's... what's going on?

04:38.291 --> 04:40.045
The system seems to be overheating.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.418
There's too much power.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.379
Shut... shut it down quickly.

04:49.928 --> 04:52.220
Marty. Marty, you okay?

04:52.282 --> 04:55.318
A little bruised, Doctor
Palmer, but I'll live.

04:55.365 --> 04:57.854
- Wait, what?
- Everything...

04:57.895 --> 04:59.661
hurts.

04:59.786 --> 05:01.613
Whoa!

05:01.897 --> 05:03.611
Look at my hands.

05:04.107 --> 05:05.703
They're white.

05:05.975 --> 05:09.280
And mine appear to be African-American.

05:09.326 --> 05:11.376
You can just say "black," Grey.

05:14.298 --> 05:16.714
You're me, and I'm you?

05:17.546 --> 05:19.400
Oh, pancakes.

05:19.483 --> 05:20.799
<i>Attention, Legends.</i>

05:20.856 --> 05:22.761
<i>Captain Lance requests
that all personnel</i>

05:22.781 --> 05:24.532
<i>report to the bridge immediately.</i>

05:26.758 --> 05:29.319
I guess we know where
the explosion came from.

05:29.365 --> 05:30.893
- What happened?
- Yes.

05:30.944 --> 05:32.855
Pray tell, Dr. Palmer.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.445
What exactly happened to us?

05:34.470 --> 05:37.563
Because it seems we are in a
particularly precarious situation

05:37.584 --> 05:39.871
that I, for one, have
no idea how to remedy.

05:39.891 --> 05:42.576
- Why don't we just merge?
- Out of the question.

05:42.597 --> 05:45.039
Absolutely not. We have switched bodies.

05:45.075 --> 05:46.712
Who knows what else may have shifted?

05:46.753 --> 05:50.160
Merging now could cause a meltdown
of insurmountable proportions.

05:50.191 --> 05:52.302
We just... we just
can't afford the risk.

05:56.861 --> 05:58.430
You're the Professor,

05:58.555 --> 06:00.083
and you're Jax.

06:00.145 --> 06:02.195
Switched.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.468
Must be Tuesday.

06:05.659 --> 06:06.893
What's going on?

06:06.898 --> 06:09.917
Well, we seem to have a bit
of a "Freaky Friday" situation.

06:09.948 --> 06:11.827
- I'm Jax.
- And I'm Martin.

06:11.884 --> 06:12.932
Cool.

06:12.962 --> 06:16.144
- So this is why we've been summoned?
- No, actually.

06:16.650 --> 06:17.828
- Okay.
- Tell them.

06:17.864 --> 06:20.802
1937, Hollywood, California.

06:20.843 --> 06:23.068
A beautiful woman mysteriously appeared

06:23.094 --> 06:25.893
and threw the entire
film industry into chaos.

06:25.955 --> 06:28.671
She apparently was so beautiful
that both Warner Brothers

06:28.697 --> 06:31.128
and K&G Pictures went to war over her,

06:31.164 --> 06:33.085
and it got ugly, fast.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.826
Literal backs were stabbed. People died.

06:35.851 --> 06:37.767
Those Hollywood idiots
probably had it coming.

06:37.819 --> 06:40.178
Maybe, but this wasn't
supposed to happen,

06:40.204 --> 06:41.929
so we are going to fix it.

06:41.949 --> 06:45.231
It will be a nice, easy mission,
and we'll get our mojo back.

06:45.256 --> 06:48.403
Awesome, maybe now I might actually
get to meet some celebrities.

06:48.418 --> 06:49.750
And how would you even know?

06:49.776 --> 06:51.329
The oldest movie you've ever watched

06:51.355 --> 06:53.451
is some ridiculous farce
called "Police Academy."

06:53.487 --> 06:55.109
Don't knock the "Academy," Grey.

06:55.135 --> 06:57.835
Doesn't matter because you
two are a liability like this,

06:57.855 --> 06:59.141
and you are staying on the ship.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.618
- Wait, what?
- Oh, fantastic.

07:00.649 --> 07:03.014
Gideon, plot a course for Tinseltown.

07:03.139 --> 07:05.190
_

07:08.848 --> 07:10.495
<i>You're sad.</i>

07:11.841 --> 07:14.629
Paris has gone off to fight Menelaus.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.878
He may die.

07:17.412 --> 07:20.772
How could you live with
yourself if you lost him?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.825
Cut!

07:23.850 --> 07:25.741
That was aces!

07:25.761 --> 07:27.511
Check the gate. Moving on.

07:27.636 --> 07:29.152
All right, everybody. You heard the man.

07:29.188 --> 07:30.231
Got a movie to make.

07:30.262 --> 07:32.643
- Let's go, people!
- I got eyes on her.

07:32.673 --> 07:35.285
All right, remember,
We're doing recon only.

07:35.291 --> 07:36.721
Nobody moves on her.

07:36.742 --> 07:38.311
Let's see what we're dealing with.

07:38.342 --> 07:39.591
<i>What can you tell us?</i>

07:39.674 --> 07:42.794
She's... really, really pretty.

07:43.070 --> 07:45.032
She looks familiar,

07:45.047 --> 07:46.466
like I've seen her somewhere.

07:46.513 --> 07:48.599
I'm sure she's never
heard that one before.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.546
The gossip I'm hearing is that
this woman is seriously Method.

07:51.557 --> 07:53.245
She hasn't broken character
since she got here.

07:53.271 --> 07:54.618
I'm going in.

07:54.845 --> 07:57.917
- Maybe I can talk to her.
- Negative. Recon only.

07:57.933 --> 08:00.070
I don't want to spook
her. She's out of her time.

08:01.484 --> 08:03.415
I am so sorry, miss.

08:03.875 --> 08:06.364
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

08:06.426 --> 08:08.811
Hey, watch what you're doing.
You almost took her head off.

08:08.858 --> 08:10.717
- Are you okay?
- Yes, it's really nothing.

08:10.728 --> 08:12.313
- Hey!
- Get lost, you twit.

08:12.350 --> 08:14.890
- I asked the lady a question.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.439
Oh, try stopping me, tough guy.

08:17.332 --> 08:18.866
That escalated quickly.

08:18.891 --> 08:20.735
W... what's going on?

08:22.314 --> 08:25.050
There's only one woman in history

08:25.060 --> 08:26.769
who has this effect on men.

08:28.798 --> 08:30.651
She really is Helen of Troy.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.879
- She's on the move. <i>
- Follow her.</i>

08:44.414 --> 08:46.057
What's she doing now?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.575
She's alone now.

08:47.772 --> 08:49.480
She looks upset.

08:49.501 --> 08:51.354
What are we waiting for? Let's grab her.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.960
A kidnapping in broad daylight?

08:52.997 --> 08:54.804
Even we shouldn't be so careless.

08:54.845 --> 08:56.817
Jack... I mean Martin... is right.

08:56.822 --> 08:58.155
We have to wait.

08:58.157 --> 09:00.168
What the hell is going on here?

09:00.760 --> 09:02.036
Where's Helen?

09:02.321 --> 09:03.661
Well, find her! Now!

09:03.663 --> 09:04.985
Z, you got incoming.

09:05.021 --> 09:06.797
Studio boss is looking for his new face.

09:06.799 --> 09:09.048
Yeah, so is someone else...

09:09.910 --> 09:11.802
My, oh, my...

09:11.804 --> 09:15.445
Now, the rumors I've been
hearing could not do you justice.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.941
You really are something special.

09:17.943 --> 09:19.739
The name's Eddie.

09:20.397 --> 09:24.214
- Eddie Rothberg, K&G Pictures.
- I'm Helen.

09:24.339 --> 09:26.250
That's right, honey. Don't do it.

09:26.444 --> 09:29.155
Someone taught you not to get
into cars with strangers, right?

09:29.181 --> 09:30.891
Hop in.

09:31.491 --> 09:33.190
Or not.

09:35.807 --> 09:38.228
Rothberg. Helen! Wait!

09:38.230 --> 09:41.325
Stop! Rothberg, you son of a bitch!

09:41.344 --> 09:43.493
I'll kill you myself, you rat bastard!

09:45.649 --> 09:47.018
Aah!

09:48.607 --> 09:51.354
Did that just happen?

09:52.528 --> 09:56.190
"Paris stole Helen from Menelaus.

09:56.466 --> 09:58.402
And the war began..."

10:05.068 --> 10:08.095
I thought the Helen of Troy
story was just a myth.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.579
Well, we've found that myths tend
to have some truth about them...

10:10.598 --> 10:12.206
this one more than most.

10:12.214 --> 10:15.404
Helen and her lover, Paris,
set off a ten-year war

10:15.405 --> 10:17.124
that launched thousands of ships

10:17.176 --> 10:20.232
and sent tens of thousands
of men off to their death,

10:20.247 --> 10:21.440
all in the name of her beauty.

10:21.471 --> 10:23.670
You make it sound like it's her fault.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.983
Men always find a reason to fight.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.945
- That's not on her.
- Depends.

10:28.070 --> 10:30.414
- How hot is she?
- I mean, she's all right.

10:30.416 --> 10:33.232
- She's really hot.
- Seems kind of little league, right?

10:33.252 --> 10:34.481
I mean, what's the
big deal if this chick

10:34.491 --> 10:35.973
gets to make a bunch of movies?

10:36.030 --> 10:37.899
What's the big deal?

10:38.100 --> 10:41.389
Helen is taking over the
classics like an infestation.

10:41.431 --> 10:43.893
What's... what's "Casablanca"
without Ingrid Bergman?

10:43.898 --> 10:46.588
The "Philadelphia Story"
without Katherine Hepburn?

10:46.603 --> 10:47.997
It's... it's inconceivable.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.824
And now this upstart

10:49.834 --> 10:52.581
steals the career-making
role of Hedy LaMarr...

10:52.601 --> 10:54.037
my boyhood crush.

10:56.237 --> 10:58.125
Sorry, I'm still adjusting. Look...

10:58.250 --> 11:00.619
I've seen the chaos that
she causes with my own eyes.

11:00.687 --> 11:02.762
We need to get Helen
out of the movie business

11:02.783 --> 11:04.158
before anybody else gets hurt.

11:04.182 --> 11:05.503
Gideon, where's Helen now?

11:05.514 --> 11:07.599
<i>I checked the tabloid
archives, and it so happens</i>

11:07.620 --> 11:09.520
<i>Edward Rothberg of K&G Pictures</i>

11:09.522 --> 11:10.883
<i>is throwing a gala this afternoon</i>

11:10.909 --> 11:12.499
<i>to show off his latest star.</i>

11:12.566 --> 11:15.287
Which would be the one
and only Helen of Troy.

11:15.354 --> 11:17.234
Well, everybody go put your best digs on

11:17.254 --> 11:19.211
because we are going to save Hollywood.

11:19.468 --> 11:20.780
Yeah...

11:20.852 --> 11:23.535
until the Kardashians destroy it.

11:23.618 --> 11:27.353
Finally, a positive side
effect to our predicament.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.385
I'm absolutely giddy at the notion

11:29.405 --> 11:32.341
of attending a 1930s Hollywood gala.

11:32.386 --> 11:34.374
Maybe I'll rub elbows with Clark Gable

11:34.406 --> 11:36.135
or dance with Ginger Rogers.

11:36.150 --> 11:38.159
You have a little
extra fun for me, Grey.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.285
I'm sitting this one out.

11:39.718 --> 11:42.882
- W... why? What's... what's wrong?
- I'm wasted, man.

11:43.222 --> 11:47.167
My joints ache. I feel
like I'm walking under water,

11:47.193 --> 11:50.761
and I have to use the
bathroom, like, all the time.

11:50.886 --> 11:52.563
I assure you,

11:52.565 --> 11:55.001
the moment we get Helen
back to her proper time,

11:55.027 --> 11:56.633
we will fix this.

11:58.003 --> 12:00.042
Damn, I look good.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.774
What's wrong? Are you all right?

12:13.832 --> 12:17.417
Can we please go back in time and
murder whoever invented stockings?

12:20.220 --> 12:22.151
- <i>Any sign of Helen?</i>
- No.

12:22.213 --> 12:24.701
But Ray's becoming friends
with Cecil B. DeMille.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.302
That is one remarkable mug, young man.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.763
And you've never been in a picture?

12:28.789 --> 12:30.307
Uh, no, not that I recall.

12:30.343 --> 12:32.006
Well, I'm shooting one next month.

12:32.022 --> 12:34.221
Cary Grant backed out,
but this profile of yours

12:34.240 --> 12:36.571
- might just have him outdone.
- Huh.

12:36.597 --> 12:39.346
Stick with me, and they'll
be saying "Cary who?"

12:40.637 --> 12:44.103
Ray is ready for his close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.001
- There she is. <i>
- You found Helen?</i>

12:47.126 --> 12:49.531
No. Hedy LaMarr.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.461
The most beautiful woman in the world.

12:51.474 --> 12:55.985
Not only is she a talented
actress, but she is a genius.

12:56.028 --> 12:58.024
Brilliant and beautiful.

12:58.347 --> 13:01.775
- I'd do her.
- Trust you, Mr. Rory,

13:01.809 --> 13:04.067
to take something
precious and debase it.

13:04.069 --> 13:08.396
She's also an inventor. Her
patent on frequency hopping alone

13:08.415 --> 13:10.758
revolutionized the world.

13:11.087 --> 13:13.094
Tuck in your shirt.

13:16.382 --> 13:18.200
Ms. LaMarr.

13:18.239 --> 13:21.407
Uh, I just wanted to say I am
one of your biggest admirers.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.520
You are a remarkable actress.

13:23.522 --> 13:25.201
How would you know?

13:25.227 --> 13:27.822
I haven't acted in any American films.

13:28.193 --> 13:30.027
Now I probably never will.

13:30.029 --> 13:32.676
I came here today to take one last shot

13:32.698 --> 13:35.399
at making my dreams come
true and meet Mr. DeMille.

13:35.401 --> 13:37.704
But the closest I'll get to Mr. DeMille

13:37.705 --> 13:40.343
is transferring his
calls at Warner Brothers.

13:40.606 --> 13:42.382
"Operator, how may I direct your call?"

13:42.415 --> 13:45.603
But surely someone with your talent

13:45.629 --> 13:47.120
will find work as an actress.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.404
Tough luck finding work
when she's in the room.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.063
Who?

13:59.158 --> 14:01.357
Any girl can look glamorous.

14:01.428 --> 14:04.205
She just has to stand
still and look stupid.

14:04.215 --> 14:05.806
Is everyone in position?

14:05.931 --> 14:07.397
Yes.

14:07.849 --> 14:09.327
Thank you.

14:18.310 --> 14:20.880
- Sandwich?
- Uh, no.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.578
<i>Ray? Nate?</i>

14:23.649 --> 14:25.185
Rory?

14:25.946 --> 14:28.708
Holy Helen of Troy.

14:29.021 --> 14:31.298
Yeah. That spells hot.

14:32.593 --> 14:34.994
<i>Guys, snap out of it.
We got a job to do.</i>

14:34.995 --> 14:36.647
Hey, check out her security detail.

14:36.666 --> 14:38.731
- The woman's a prisoner.
- Not for long.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.222
We just need to get her alone.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.435
Z?

14:45.533 --> 14:48.095
Oh.

14:48.340 --> 14:50.109
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh.

14:50.376 --> 14:51.928
- Please excuse me.
- Of course.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.148
Nice.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.446
Ray, suit up and meet us at
the balcony for extraction.

14:58.217 --> 14:59.809
Helen, you have to come with us.

14:59.822 --> 15:01.280
You don't belong here, and you know it.

15:01.312 --> 15:04.959
You must be from Warner Brothers.

15:04.985 --> 15:06.667
Tell Arnold that I'm sorry,

15:06.689 --> 15:08.725
but I left him for a better opportunity.

15:08.727 --> 15:10.826
Oh, you actually are a good actress.

15:10.833 --> 15:13.150
Yeah, I hear they have a
decent theater scene in Troy.

15:13.188 --> 15:15.435
We should go check it out.

15:15.945 --> 15:17.726
No.

15:18.378 --> 15:21.571
No, the Gods have answered my
prayers by bringing me here.

15:21.573 --> 15:23.473
This place is strange,

15:23.475 --> 15:25.375
but I'm learning its rules.

15:25.377 --> 15:27.310
And the first rule of Hollywood is...

15:27.312 --> 15:30.388
never discuss business
without your agent present.

15:30.607 --> 15:34.384
I guess she's not just a pretty face.

15:34.386 --> 15:36.706
Everybody get ready to
move. We got to go fast.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.140
Helen, darling, why don't you
run along and find Mr. Rothberg?

15:44.398 --> 15:46.530
Gladly.

15:49.847 --> 15:52.906
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Aside from collecting my 15%?

15:52.958 --> 15:54.648
You're her agent.

15:54.773 --> 15:58.052
You know that I have the killer
instinct that this job requires.

16:01.046 --> 16:02.749
I didn't come here to fight.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.577
I came to talk.

16:06.702 --> 16:08.345
And I didn't come alone.

16:12.336 --> 16:14.468
If you don't take me up
on my offer for parlay,

16:14.496 --> 16:15.980
things could get ugly for you,

16:16.012 --> 16:18.462
your team, and Hollywood's elite.

16:20.698 --> 16:22.047
All right.

16:22.370 --> 16:26.468
Everybody stand down. Darhk and
I have some catching up to do.

16:26.472 --> 16:28.094
Thank you.

16:32.932 --> 16:34.368
Don't worry.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.524
Poison is a coward's weapon.

16:36.582 --> 16:39.571
And our conflict is
at a brief standstill.

16:40.488 --> 16:43.063
_

16:43.188 --> 16:45.019
You're from Zambesi?

16:46.181 --> 16:48.902
And your powers...
Where do they come from?

16:48.956 --> 16:50.523
I would have thought
you would have been able

16:50.524 --> 16:52.435
to sense one of your own.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.662
You're a totem bearer.

16:55.404 --> 16:57.834
You wanted to talk, so talk.

16:57.836 --> 16:59.438
Ah. You know for someone who died,

16:59.464 --> 17:01.380
you don't appreciate the
simple things in life.

17:01.399 --> 17:03.781
Me? I'm a changed man,

17:03.820 --> 17:06.544
which is why I'm trying to
do this the civilized way.

17:06.569 --> 17:08.964
- Do what?
- Convince you and your friends

17:08.977 --> 17:10.700
to pack up and ship out.

17:10.825 --> 17:12.715
You want Helen to stay.

17:12.718 --> 17:15.724
What can I say? Anachronisms
are good for business.

17:15.849 --> 17:19.797
- You wield the Water Totem.
- In a matter of speaking.

17:19.922 --> 17:22.722
- The totem is now part of me.
- And you've perverted it.

17:22.758 --> 17:24.946
Totem bearers must protect the innocent,

17:24.973 --> 17:26.707
not use it for selfish gain.

17:26.753 --> 17:29.273
You dare lecture me on selfishness?

17:29.351 --> 17:31.964
You're the one who's turned
her back on her own people

17:32.004 --> 17:33.937
in favor of these bungling idiots.

17:33.938 --> 17:35.748
You know nothing about me.

17:35.807 --> 17:38.087
You really do look lovely.

17:38.412 --> 17:40.694
That color always suited you.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.200
- So are you an actor?
- Yes, um...

17:53.220 --> 17:55.525
Well, maybe. My name's Ray.

17:55.527 --> 17:57.030
- And...
- Haircut!

17:57.107 --> 17:58.269
It's time to leave.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.916
Didn't you hear us on the comms?

17:59.947 --> 18:01.971
No, my... my comms aren't working.

18:02.017 --> 18:04.434
Um, just ignore them.
They're being rude.

18:04.469 --> 18:05.936
Let's get back to our
private conversation.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.271
What are you doing?

18:12.679 --> 18:15.111
Get your mitts off me!

18:15.113 --> 18:17.176
Unhand the lady!

18:20.352 --> 18:21.803
Are you all right?

18:21.994 --> 18:23.470
I am now.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.993
How convenient.

18:29.995 --> 18:32.673
Here I was, thinking I was
going to have to convince you

18:32.692 --> 18:35.209
what a mess your team makes of things

18:35.334 --> 18:36.590
and that you'd all be better off

18:36.626 --> 18:38.335
if you just went back
to your old lives...

18:38.337 --> 18:40.604
which brings me to my offer.

18:40.606 --> 18:42.043
I will let you all walk...

18:42.168 --> 18:44.305
Unharmed, if you all leave now

18:44.351 --> 18:46.906
and go back to 2017.

18:47.325 --> 18:48.730
Or what?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.217
Or...

18:50.342 --> 18:52.612
I will kill your merry band of idiots

18:52.669 --> 18:55.689
one-by-one, saving you for last.

18:55.761 --> 18:58.446
And then you will die knowing
you could have saved them all

18:58.457 --> 19:00.862
if you'd only made the right choice.

19:12.755 --> 19:15.156
- What were you guys thinking?
- They weren't.

19:15.161 --> 19:17.964
Like every man in the room, they
were just captivated by Helen.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.597
Okay, in our defense,

19:19.633 --> 19:23.111
she was very, very,
very... very attractive.

19:23.150 --> 19:26.112
Yeah, I was just
admiring her personality.

19:26.237 --> 19:30.126
So you jackasses decided to
impress her by having a fight?

19:30.251 --> 19:32.592
- Wha... Mick started it.
- All right, enough finger pointing.

19:32.624 --> 19:35.896
- We need to focus on the real issue here.
- Damien Darhk.

19:35.928 --> 19:38.361
Wait, Darhk was there,
and you're still alive?

19:38.413 --> 19:40.033
He didn't want to
fight. He wanted to talk.

19:40.052 --> 19:41.859
And he made us an "offer."

19:42.072 --> 19:43.814
We stop doing what we're doing.

19:43.939 --> 19:46.370
No more Waverider. No
more fixing Anachronisms.

19:46.409 --> 19:49.176
Wait, what does Darhk care
if we fix Anachronisms or not?

19:49.301 --> 19:51.459
I don't know. We didn't have
time to get into his evil agenda.

19:51.510 --> 19:54.310
Well, we've seen what Darhk
can do. Can we even fight him?

19:54.346 --> 19:55.771
Yeah, especially now that he's walking

19:55.802 --> 19:58.579
- with the time caddy and the water witch.
- She's not a witch.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.478
Her name is Kuasa.

20:00.603 --> 20:03.184
And she possesses one of
the lost totems of Zambesi.

20:03.846 --> 20:07.291
- Kuasa...
- Darhk massacred those Time Bureau agents

20:07.317 --> 20:10.188
in Victorian London without
even batting an eyelid.

20:10.213 --> 20:12.072
What if we can't take them?

20:12.197 --> 20:14.261
This might be our best offer.

20:14.329 --> 20:17.586
You don't offer a deal unless
you want something in return.

20:17.711 --> 20:19.807
Besides, if he lets us walk,

20:19.832 --> 20:21.923
he's just going to
take us out one by one.

20:22.367 --> 20:25.625
That's right. We're stronger
together. We know that.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.127
Darhk knows that.

20:27.422 --> 20:29.735
All right. Let's get Helen on the ship.

20:29.807 --> 20:31.036
Nope.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.319
After that party, you
three are grounded.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.605
And I need you and the professor

20:34.636 --> 20:35.988
to figure out why our
comms aren't working.

20:36.019 --> 20:39.100
- You mean me and the professor?
- Whatever.

20:39.577 --> 20:41.571
Uh, Amaya...

20:42.307 --> 20:43.959
What's up?

20:44.682 --> 20:48.547
Um, I just wanted to wish you
guys, uh, good luck out there.

20:48.909 --> 20:51.006
Thank you.

20:59.711 --> 21:02.529
Not too shabby. As far as prisons go.

21:02.531 --> 21:05.075
It's the same security
detail from the party.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.700
I guess Helen's still inside.

21:06.702 --> 21:08.591
You really think they'll
fall for this stunt?

21:08.624 --> 21:11.776
Have men gotten smarter in
the past few thousand years?

21:11.807 --> 21:13.774
Nope.

21:22.308 --> 21:24.877
Dude, this is impossible.

21:24.896 --> 21:27.271
I can barely get my
hands inside this console,

21:27.289 --> 21:29.072
let alone handle the wiring.

21:29.117 --> 21:33.527
How am I supposed to fix
something if my fingers don't work?

21:33.837 --> 21:36.386
It's called arthritis.

21:36.398 --> 21:37.964
And just so you know,

21:37.966 --> 21:42.202
I don't enjoy being inside you any
more than you enjoy being inside me.

21:42.204 --> 21:44.903
What did I...

21:44.961 --> 21:47.604
- Don't be so puerile.
- Come on, Grey!

21:47.620 --> 21:49.190
Don't pretend like you weren't having

21:49.216 --> 21:51.054
the time of your life at that party.

21:51.069 --> 21:52.752
I don't catch your meaning.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.426
Telepathic link.

21:55.907 --> 21:58.979
Let's just say I can tell
if you weren't married,

21:58.999 --> 22:03.867
you and Ms. LaMarr would be
doing the nasty in the past-y.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.294
Nasty in the...

22:05.419 --> 22:09.586
I'll have you know that
Ms. LaMarr is my hall pass.

22:09.650 --> 22:12.625
Clarissa gave you a freebie?

22:12.677 --> 22:15.717
It was her idea. Something
to spice up our marriage.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.640
She picked Jean-Claude Van Damme,

22:17.666 --> 22:19.976
and thinking the whole
exercise ridiculous,

22:20.021 --> 22:22.428
I chose Hedy LaMarr,

22:22.448 --> 22:24.797
never thinking I'd
actually get the chance.

22:24.922 --> 22:26.823
Why, 'cause she's dead?

22:27.116 --> 22:30.437
She's not dead here, you dog.

22:36.225 --> 22:38.317
No deliveries tonight.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.293
Really?

22:40.295 --> 22:43.296
'Cause I got Mr. Rothberg's
prized horse back there.

22:43.531 --> 22:45.432
Nothin' here about no horse.

22:45.751 --> 22:48.281
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

22:48.965 --> 22:50.537
Fine.

22:50.539 --> 22:52.592
Just gonna need to check the back.

23:01.402 --> 23:03.750
Oh, you mean his prize whores.

23:03.964 --> 23:06.306
- Did he just call us...
- Yeah.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.463
Please don't scream.

23:15.464 --> 23:18.296
She said "please." You gonna behave?

23:20.439 --> 23:22.111
Please don't take me away.

23:22.169 --> 23:24.221
I'm sorry, but this
isn't your home, Helen.

23:24.259 --> 23:27.240
Do you have any idea what it's
like on the plains of Troy?

23:27.479 --> 23:30.977
This land of Hollywood
is far from perfect,

23:30.979 --> 23:34.214
but at least men aren't
killing one another in my name.

23:38.282 --> 23:40.934
Not yet anyway. We got incoming.

23:42.458 --> 23:44.591
Rothberg!

23:44.593 --> 23:47.574
You think you can poach my
talent, you no good son of a bitch!

23:47.651 --> 23:51.191
I dare you to come at
me, you dumb bastard!

23:54.491 --> 23:58.972
Why does this always
happen? I truly am cursed.

23:59.310 --> 24:02.496
Hey, this isn't your fault,
but you can make it stop.

24:02.536 --> 24:04.377
Come with us.

24:09.208 --> 24:11.708
Ugh, we can't let those
idiots kill each other.

24:11.709 --> 24:13.848
Protect them. I'll
get Helen out of here.

24:19.547 --> 24:20.992
Hey!

24:21.063 --> 24:23.051
What do you think you're
doing with Rothberg's girl?

24:23.084 --> 24:25.129
Just renegotiating her deal.

24:32.074 --> 24:33.951
Great Zeus.

24:35.428 --> 24:36.917
They're warriors.

24:45.038 --> 24:46.686
Sorry, fellas.

24:46.688 --> 24:50.381
Your new starlet decided
she's better off a free agent.

25:00.438 --> 25:02.729
This vessel... it's remarkable.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.970
Wait till you see her fly.
Gideon, show her what you can do.

25:07.466 --> 25:08.773
Gideon?

25:09.654 --> 25:11.403
What's going on?

25:11.442 --> 25:12.843
Gideon?

25:12.882 --> 25:15.024
Have you figured it out yet?

25:15.149 --> 25:17.128
Socket wrench, Grey.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.246
Does this look like a
socket wrench to you?

25:19.265 --> 25:22.808
I specialize in subatomic
particles, not...

25:22.933 --> 25:25.841
- hand tools.
- That's obvious.

25:25.879 --> 25:29.210
Anyway, it doesn't matter. Comms
weren't the only thing affected.

25:29.242 --> 25:33.331
Half the ship's systems
are down... Aw, crap.

25:33.456 --> 25:36.770
Please tell me we're not stuck in 1937.

25:38.055 --> 25:40.695
Gideon and other vital
systems are offline.

25:41.424 --> 25:43.225
How is that even possible?

25:43.238 --> 25:45.516
Could be Damien Darhk.
What better way to catch us

25:45.542 --> 25:47.265
than to shut down the Waverider?

25:47.390 --> 25:50.182
It's like parts of the ship
are straight-up vanishing.

25:50.189 --> 25:51.660
Of course they are, Jefferson,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.152
because in this version of history,

25:53.188 --> 25:55.021
those technologies no longer exist.

25:55.023 --> 25:56.679
Wait, what are you talking about Jax?

25:56.695 --> 25:58.391
I mean... Marty.

25:58.393 --> 26:01.113
Can't you see? This is
all because of Hedy LaMarr.

26:01.497 --> 26:05.227
As you know, Dr. Palmer,
technological advances are cumulative.

26:05.352 --> 26:08.632
They build over time,
and it seems her patent...

26:08.637 --> 26:11.689
Is the backbone for half
the Waverider's systems.

26:11.690 --> 26:14.183
And without it, we're
essentially, well...

26:14.223 --> 26:17.084
Screwed. Where's Hedy now?

26:17.109 --> 26:19.062
She said she was starting a new job

26:19.114 --> 26:20.881
as an operator for Warner Brothers.

26:20.963 --> 26:23.395
Shouldn't be hard to get her
re-signed with Mr. Coleson

26:23.418 --> 26:25.510
- now that his "It girl" is gone.
- Where are you going?

26:25.536 --> 26:28.240
To get Ms. LaMarr's
career back on track.

26:28.365 --> 26:31.625
You better not just be calling
in your hall pass, Grey.

26:33.082 --> 26:36.635
I don't want to
overstep, but may I ask...

26:37.432 --> 26:39.984
What Gods gave you
such incredible powers?

26:40.275 --> 26:43.380
Uh, the Gods didn't give us powers.

26:43.505 --> 26:45.986
Well, maybe they kind
of did for Amaya and me,

26:46.008 --> 26:48.408
but the captain's a self-made woman.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.044
Sara trains every day.
She's a total badass.

26:51.046 --> 26:52.815
- She's a captain, too?
- Yeah.

26:53.441 --> 26:56.513
It gives me hope knowing
that you come from a time

26:56.518 --> 26:59.056
where women have the
same opportunities as men.

26:59.181 --> 27:01.147
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

27:01.205 --> 27:03.813
Anywhere must be better
than where I came from.

27:03.864 --> 27:07.401
I spent the last five years
alone, locked up in a tower.

27:08.330 --> 27:11.665
My only view was a distant
battle waging below...

27:11.667 --> 27:13.713
men killing each other.

27:13.726 --> 27:15.398
For what?

27:15.443 --> 27:16.934
Me?

27:18.540 --> 27:21.875
And now you want to send me
back to that hellish place.

27:26.672 --> 27:29.641
Warner Brothers, how may
I direct your call?

27:29.835 --> 27:32.335
Warner Brothers, please hold.

27:32.352 --> 27:34.729
How may I help you? One moment, please.

27:34.768 --> 27:36.333
Ms. LaMarr.

27:36.336 --> 27:39.208
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Coleson is in the commissary.

27:39.228 --> 27:41.822
You have to talk to him
and get your contract back.

27:41.947 --> 27:43.784
Why do you care so much?

27:43.909 --> 27:45.894
Warner Brothers, how
may I direct your call?

27:46.294 --> 27:48.779
Warner Brothers, how
may I direct your call?

27:48.904 --> 27:51.057
There must be a better
way of switching signals.

27:51.089 --> 27:54.141
There is. You're meant
for better things.

27:54.180 --> 27:56.743
You have no idea the
adventures you'll miss out on

27:56.745 --> 27:59.734
- if you don't follow me out that door.
- You're crazy.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.709
Sometimes you have to be
if you want to burn bright.

28:14.696 --> 28:16.073
Oh, no.

28:16.088 --> 28:18.289
This is our lucky day.

28:18.414 --> 28:20.742
Wait, you're that talent
agent from the party.

28:20.761 --> 28:23.278
Ms. LaMarr...

28:23.872 --> 28:26.106
Oh, I assure you...

28:26.108 --> 28:30.110
I am something far more
ruthless than a Hollywood agent..

28:30.423 --> 28:32.792
If that's possible.

28:39.368 --> 28:42.234
Okay, I didn't actually think
you'd take me up on my offer,

28:42.253 --> 28:44.014
but after my warning,
I thought you people

28:44.047 --> 28:45.699
would at least use the buddy system.

28:45.718 --> 28:49.946
But here you are, all alone,
without your better half

28:49.978 --> 28:52.624
to give you at least a fighting chance.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.399
You and your
insufferable pontificating...

28:55.412 --> 28:56.871
Wait, wait, wait, excuse me.

28:56.890 --> 28:59.556
Either someone got
themselves a thesaurus, or...

29:03.177 --> 29:05.305
He isn't who he appears to be.

29:07.088 --> 29:08.527
He's the old one.

29:08.553 --> 29:11.463
No, no.

29:11.657 --> 29:13.328
You guys switched bodies.

29:13.367 --> 29:15.025
Oh, that is rich.

29:17.845 --> 29:21.433
- You need a minute?
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

29:21.558 --> 29:24.866
Let's kill them.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.282
Grey's scared to death. I can feel it.

29:27.294 --> 29:28.802
Darhk must have found him.

29:28.853 --> 29:30.467
- We're going in.
- I'm coming with you.

29:30.512 --> 29:31.990
You sure you're up for this, Jax?

29:32.061 --> 29:34.617
- Save Grey? Damn right I am.
- You may want to pee first.

29:34.636 --> 29:36.882
We're not gonna stop to
help you find a bathroom.

29:36.947 --> 29:38.354
Good point.

29:38.406 --> 29:39.735
Me too.

29:39.935 --> 29:42.343
Just don't make it a deuce, Mick.

29:42.975 --> 29:45.131
Yeah, and if you do, flush.

29:45.176 --> 29:47.648
What did he mean about your other half?

29:47.672 --> 29:50.247
- Are you married?
- Oh, you mean Jefferson.

29:50.248 --> 29:52.610
Yes, I suppose in a
way we are married, too.

29:52.677 --> 29:54.837
- It's hard to explain.
- You're a homosexual.

29:54.962 --> 29:58.619
No, I'm one half of a
nuclear-powered superhero...

29:58.671 --> 30:01.059
except the two of us
accidentally switched bodies.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.479
They're here.

30:02.505 --> 30:04.545
- I can feel them.
- Hide, hide.

30:04.726 --> 30:06.199
What is going on?

30:06.222 --> 30:09.171
The captain asked us to keep
you safe until the ship's fixed.

30:09.191 --> 30:11.631
And the only way we can do
that is by saving Hedy LaMarr.

30:11.663 --> 30:14.193
I... don't understand any of this.

30:14.219 --> 30:16.982
That's okay. Time travel is...

30:17.107 --> 30:18.827
It's very, very confusing.

30:18.853 --> 30:20.273
With the power out, we're going to have

30:20.299 --> 30:21.971
to lock the outside doors manually.

30:21.973 --> 30:24.843
- Right.
- You're leaving me on my own?

30:24.851 --> 30:26.743
Defenseless?

30:28.635 --> 30:30.369
Here.

30:33.446 --> 30:35.556
Now you're not defenseless.

30:43.937 --> 30:46.478
It appears they have us boxed in.

30:46.502 --> 30:50.264
- On my signal, run.
- W... what about you?

30:50.389 --> 30:53.377
Look, just focus on
getting yourself to safety

30:53.401 --> 30:55.692
and don't give up on your dream.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.630
Oh, goodie.

31:10.658 --> 31:12.772
The cavalry has arrived.

31:12.897 --> 31:16.259
Oh, how I missed those
whimsical outfits of yours.

31:16.261 --> 31:18.637
Your beef is with me, Damien.

31:18.762 --> 31:21.929
So let's fight. You and me...

31:21.953 --> 31:23.897
League style.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.172
Two swords...

31:27.297 --> 31:29.132
zero magic.

31:29.624 --> 31:32.560
A duel. How quaint.

31:33.964 --> 31:36.319
- Grey!
- But you do realize...

31:37.029 --> 31:40.183
I don't need magic to kill you.

31:40.433 --> 31:42.264
Funny...

31:42.474 --> 31:45.688
that's what Oliver Queen said
right before he killed you.

32:05.007 --> 32:09.779
Foolish girl. I extended
my hand to you in kindness.

32:09.781 --> 32:12.139
Now you've left me no choice.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.283
Let her go.

32:18.069 --> 32:21.124
If it isn't the great protectress.

32:34.205 --> 32:35.972
Whatever you're doing, don't.

32:37.442 --> 32:40.811
Bring it.

32:44.682 --> 32:48.129
What the...

33:00.269 --> 33:02.462
Ugh.

33:02.474 --> 33:05.032
- Grey, Grey, you all right?
- I'll live.

33:05.033 --> 33:08.381
It seems your body's youthful
resilience has its advantages.

33:08.431 --> 33:11.674
- Hedy, I told you to run.
- And I didn't listen.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.957
You must be his other half.
You two need to use your powers.

33:14.981 --> 33:18.158
We can't. It could cause a
catastrophic nuclear reaction.

33:18.177 --> 33:20.064
Everybody could die.

33:24.748 --> 33:26.688
I got this.

33:57.271 --> 33:59.337
You have to become the Nuclear Man.

33:59.353 --> 34:02.096
It's Firestorm, not Nuclear Man,

34:02.104 --> 34:05.852
and we'd have to be crazy to
attempt a "Freaky Friday" merge.

34:05.871 --> 34:08.214
Yes, but yours could be the
case of quantum entanglement,

34:08.226 --> 34:10.429
which means the particles
in your body are mirrored

34:10.460 --> 34:13.145
by those of your atomic
companion, which also means...

34:13.178 --> 34:17.418
That if we merge, we could still
maintain a stable nuclear reaction.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.652
Sometimes you have to be crazy
if you wish to burn bright.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.569
What do you say, Jefferson?

34:37.638 --> 34:39.090
Not bad.

34:39.103 --> 34:42.399
You want those to be your last words?

34:45.004 --> 34:46.714
We agreed no magic.

34:46.763 --> 34:49.221
Oh, no, I agreed that I
wouldn't use <i> my</i> magic.

34:49.346 --> 34:51.956
I couldn't make that
same promise for her.

34:54.379 --> 34:56.603
That's the thing about daughters.

34:56.636 --> 35:00.611
When they see you die at the
hands of one self-righteous hero,

35:00.736 --> 35:02.985
they really don't want
to see it happen again.

35:02.987 --> 35:05.800
Your daughter?

35:05.851 --> 35:07.729
The apple of my eye.

35:11.429 --> 35:13.802
This is the famous White Canary?

35:13.841 --> 35:15.564
Hmm.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.869
Bye-bye, birdie.

35:27.265 --> 35:29.239
That's what I'm talking about, Grey!

35:41.914 --> 35:44.128
Come on, drive her back, Grey!

35:54.307 --> 35:57.592
Jefferson, I don't think I can do this.

35:58.218 --> 36:01.857
In case you haven't
noticed, I'm an old man.

36:01.982 --> 36:04.607
Yeah, true, but you got this, Grey.

36:06.951 --> 36:09.879
Come on, Grey! Let's get them, baby!

36:16.236 --> 36:19.695
Nora, darling, I think
it's time we take our leave.

36:29.305 --> 36:31.163
Please tell me Firestein's a thing.

36:31.202 --> 36:33.377
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

36:33.502 --> 36:35.177
I have to pee.

36:35.222 --> 36:38.382
- And I do not.
- You did it.

36:38.406 --> 36:40.036
You're a genius.

36:40.084 --> 36:44.183
Forming Firestorm has restored
us to our rightful bodies.

36:44.308 --> 36:46.256
Guys!

36:46.974 --> 36:50.057
Guys, we've got to get
her back to the ship.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.932
You're a disgrace to every totem
bearer who's come before you.

36:56.057 --> 37:00.112
- You have no right to wield its power.
- I have every right...

37:00.237 --> 37:03.995
- to this totem and yours.
- This totem is my family's.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.141
- Only my blood may bear it.
- And they do.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.807
You gave it to your daughter,

37:08.820 --> 37:10.602
and she was supposed to give it to me.

37:10.621 --> 37:14.481
But instead, it rests on
my little sister's throat.

37:14.519 --> 37:17.911
- That's impossible.
- That I am your granddaughter?

37:18.036 --> 37:19.783
What do you know of the future?

37:19.908 --> 37:23.503
I told you I couldn't kill
you without killing myself.

37:23.848 --> 37:25.539
But how?

37:30.548 --> 37:33.869
Kuasa, wait.

37:42.417 --> 37:46.343
I see great things for you,
Ms. LaMarr, and Warner Brothers.

37:52.409 --> 37:55.449
It appears that went well.

37:55.855 --> 37:58.134
Arnold wants me to
star in his next film.

37:58.159 --> 38:00.271
The man was so desperate
after the Greek disaster,

38:00.322 --> 38:02.826
I was able to negotiate a pay
bump out of the whole thing.

38:02.891 --> 38:04.956
Brilliant and beautiful.

38:05.014 --> 38:06.598
Thank you.

38:06.795 --> 38:09.835
I couldn't have done that
or survived without you.

38:09.871 --> 38:13.406
Oh, it... it was nothing,
really. Just doing our job...

38:13.497 --> 38:16.418
setting history back on course.

38:16.431 --> 38:18.586
- Can you guys hear me? <i>
- Loud and clear.</i>

38:18.711 --> 38:21.077
<i>And the ship's purring like a kitten.</i>

38:22.110 --> 38:24.483
Okay, time to go.

38:24.608 --> 38:27.286
Yes. Yes, we... we must be off.

38:27.802 --> 38:30.280
Well, good-bye.

38:40.005 --> 38:42.864
I actually prefer older men.

38:43.793 --> 38:45.858
Well, I'll be...

38:45.983 --> 38:48.039
You old fox.

38:48.072 --> 38:49.708
Come on, man.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.926
Hey.

38:55.182 --> 38:56.949
How's Sara?

38:57.236 --> 39:01.820
Gideon has placed her in a
coma so that she can heal fully.

39:02.031 --> 39:04.456
We'll be without a captain
for a few days, but...

39:04.458 --> 39:06.792
thankfully she'll make it.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.204
Um...

39:09.849 --> 39:11.876
there's something I need to tell you.

39:12.689 --> 39:15.522
It's something I shouldn't tell you,

39:15.542 --> 39:17.536
but it's something you should know.

39:17.538 --> 39:21.879
That Kuasa is Mari's
sister and my granddaughter.

39:22.530 --> 39:25.742
- How'd you know?
- She told me.

39:26.005 --> 39:28.494
I never knew that she even existed.

39:30.270 --> 39:32.584
I don't blame you for
not saying anything.

39:32.878 --> 39:34.820
You were just protecting the timeline.

39:34.822 --> 39:36.636
I would have done the same thing.

39:37.224 --> 39:39.320
Thank you for understanding.

39:40.668 --> 39:42.443
I can tell you everything I know,

39:42.568 --> 39:45.526
but it... it is more
complicated than you think.

39:45.985 --> 39:47.209
No.

39:48.768 --> 39:50.860
We are the protectors of history,

39:51.071 --> 39:52.571
not its editors.

39:52.775 --> 39:55.873
So the less I know, the better.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.756
Whoa, there, killer.

40:10.758 --> 40:13.619
Oh, my gods. I'm terribly sorry.

40:13.883 --> 40:15.432
I got a bit carried away.

40:15.464 --> 40:17.625
You're pretty good with that
thing. You should keep it.

40:17.798 --> 40:19.564
But this belongs to your comrade.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.415
Yeah, I think she'd be
cool with you having it.

40:22.540 --> 40:25.710
Any of those Trojans get
handsy with you back home,

40:25.751 --> 40:27.290
you show 'em what's what.

40:27.347 --> 40:29.340
Troy is hardly a home.

40:30.073 --> 40:31.943
I don't want to return there.

40:32.068 --> 40:33.929
How can you claim to be heroes,

40:33.976 --> 40:35.881
claim to do good in the world

40:36.082 --> 40:39.351
and yet force somebody back
into a horrible existence?

40:51.892 --> 40:52.964
Okay.

40:53.162 --> 40:55.423
According to the historical record,

40:55.434 --> 40:56.853
you disappeared halfway through the war,

40:56.864 --> 40:58.273
but that didn't affect the war itself.

40:58.304 --> 41:00.425
So I found you a loophole.

41:00.441 --> 41:03.539
Same time that you're from,
just a different place.

41:03.926 --> 41:06.621
Huh, I hacked history.

41:07.292 --> 41:08.433
Hmm.

41:09.416 --> 41:11.180
This isn't Troy.

41:11.305 --> 41:14.139
Nope, it's an island
full of warrior women.

41:14.264 --> 41:15.620
It's cool, right?

41:25.451 --> 41:27.552
Won't your comrades be mad at you?

41:27.976 --> 41:30.185
Yeah, yeah, they would be.

41:30.386 --> 41:33.411
But they knew what they were
getting when they brought me on.

41:35.843 --> 41:37.626
Oh, thank you.

41:38.779 --> 41:40.846
You've changed my destiny.

41:45.273 --> 41:47.319
Best thing about this place...

41:47.321 --> 41:49.061
No boys allowed.

41:49.094 --> 41:51.398
You'll finally have
some peace and quiet.
