WEBVTT

00:16.517 --> 00:17.518
Okay.

00:22.898 --> 00:25.108
Right. Let's go!

00:25.192 --> 00:26.777
First day of school!

00:54.012 --> 00:55.055
Sorry.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.224
Okay, that's for you.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.101
That's for you, sir.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.769
Right. Yep.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.524
Sure you don't just wanna
shave it all off?

01:05.607 --> 01:07.442
- No.
- Shave your head? Get rid of it?

01:07.526 --> 01:09.152
No? Okay.
Well, I'm gonna keep checking back.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.071
Have you got your show-and-tell sorted?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.074
Is that-- You want to-- Okay.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.411
- Is that interesting?
- It's magical and has special powers.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.079
Does it?

01:20.289 --> 01:22.291
Wow. Okay.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.169
Are you hearing this?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.254
He wants to get up
in front of his whole class

01:27.337 --> 01:29.006
and tell them
his rock's got magical powers.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.966
Are we all right with that?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.259
It's a comfort object.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.219
Isn't that usually a blanket or something?

01:34.303 --> 01:36.763
Jase, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.933
That is a target on his back for bullies.
I mean, that's blood in the water.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.477
Jase,
this "everyone is a threat" mentality,

01:42.561 --> 01:45.856
this is why you won't put lip balm on
when there are other men on the bus.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.734
I was bullied at school.
I know what it's like.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.987
They will latch on to anything
without adding "talks to rocks"…

01:52.070 --> 01:52.905
- No.
-…into the mix.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.364
He has a rock.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.158
He is not talking to rocks.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
What?

02:00.704 --> 02:02.247
I wasn't going to take you, but…

02:02.331 --> 02:03.832
Yeah, okay. Fine, take it off him.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.376
- But do it gently, okay.
- Okay.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.547
Do you know what?

02:10.631 --> 02:14.510
I'm thinking that maybe this is
a bit too precious to take into school.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.928
We don't wanna lose it, do we?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.679
So should we maybe leave it at home today,

02:17.763 --> 02:20.349
and perhaps
you could do your talk on this?

02:20.432 --> 02:24.102
- Okay.
- Yeah? You loved this, didn't you?

02:24.186 --> 02:25.187
I know, mate.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.482
I know that your first week back
is a bit scary.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.942
I'll tell you what.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.611
I want you to remember something,
all right?

02:33.278 --> 02:39.284
If ever you get scared,
I want you to look at this.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.495
I'll do one myself now. Ready?

02:44.373 --> 02:47.960
Inside this circle,
there's you, there's Princess,

02:48.043 --> 02:52.130
there's me, there's Nikki,
and there's our flat.

02:52.214 --> 02:56.301
Now this circle is a safe space,

02:56.385 --> 03:00.055
so whatever happens outside it
doesn't matter

03:00.138 --> 03:04.184
because you can always come back here,
to the circle.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.144
Okay? Here's a good boy.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.527
All right, come on. Let's go.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.737
Okay!

03:15.821 --> 03:19.616
So, I'm gonna put this in here, all right?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.869
Come here, you. How are we wearing it?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.912
Do you want it to the left
like a gentleman

03:23.996 --> 03:26.707
or the right like a scoundrel?

03:26.790 --> 03:27.791
Yeah? All right, perfect.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.669
Get your bags together, kids.
Come on, Nik. Let's go, babe!

03:36.925 --> 03:38.343
Come on. Let's go.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.638
- Everyone ready?
- One, two, three.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.225
- That's a shame.
- What?

03:45.309 --> 03:46.810
- Chrissie and Sarah are moving.
- Okay.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.645
All right, then. Okay.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.606
Buh-bye.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.899
- See you, babe.
- Okay, buh-bye.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.650
- Have a good day. Bye.
- Bye.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.530
You're kidding.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.231
Welcome back.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.107
How are the kids?

04:34.191 --> 04:36.109
Yeah, they're great, thanks.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.654
Not allowed to do this anymore.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.323
Yeah, even on the wider--

04:42.324 --> 04:45.702
Even on the wider desks. Okay.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.247
- How are you finding management, then?
- I love it, Terry.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.666
Fifteen feet and a million miles, right?
From there to here.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.210
Yeah.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.755
I think your relationship with the sales
team is gonna be so valuable for us.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.298
I really hope so.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.217
Because we need to fire one of them.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.721
- What?
- It's bloated and underperforming.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.474
But it's just hard to pick out
one individual…

05:07.558 --> 05:08.392
Well, yeah.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
…'cause I don't know any of their names.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.312
Right.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.815
Could you have a think?
Come back to me with a target.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.984
- Is there really no other way--
- Cheers.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.110
Right.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.915
<i>Door closing.</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.126
Where is he?

05:39.214 --> 05:40.507
I was researching it for a book.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.009
- What?
- Nothing.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.720
- You're selling our flat!
- Am I?

05:44.803 --> 05:46.180
Yes! Tresco Street. Yes.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.514
Right. Okay.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.143
Tresco Street.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.187
Yeah, they are.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.230
Well, they can't. Because it's our flat.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.732
Yeah, I feel you on that.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.860
But, I mean, technically it's theirs,
so they can.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.530
- Well, can't you talk to them?
- Yeah, absolutely! Who?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.282
The people that own the flat!

06:05.365 --> 06:08.243
Well, the flat's managed
by a property management company

06:08.327 --> 06:09.536
on behalf of a developer,

06:09.620 --> 06:11.663
who's owned by
a property investment company,

06:11.747 --> 06:13.332
who's owned by an offshore trust.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.044
Jeff? Jeff, I think
one of them was called.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.670
- I don't know. Listen.
- Is that it?

06:18.754 --> 06:22.883
I've been doing my research, okay?
And they need to give us notice.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.093
Yeah, well they sent you a letter.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.304
Well, we didn't receive the letter,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.431
so, therefore,
it is not legally binding, sir.

06:29.515 --> 06:30.933
Okay. That's not true.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.353
But even if it was true,
your tenancy runs out in three months.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.689
At which point, unfortunately,
they can do whatever they want.

06:38.482 --> 06:42.528
This is just typical Enron,
Lehman Brothers bullshit, this, innit.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.820
I don't know who they are.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.699
How can you work for vultures like this
that are preying on vulnerable people?

06:47.783 --> 06:49.326
Well, I'm actually temping here

06:49.409 --> 06:51.828
so technically
I work for Office Elves, but…

06:54.957 --> 06:56.375
Please. Come on.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.210
Come on, please don't sell our flat.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.296
Please don't.
It's got all our stuff in it.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.131
I can't-- I'm sorry, mate.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.479
Well, we'll buy it. How much is it?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.190
That's the guide price.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.360
- Oh, for-- Seriously?
- Well, yeah, approximately.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.738
Unless there was asbestos in the ceiling
or a sinkhole.

07:26.822 --> 07:30.158
I mean, even with a sinkhole,
it's pretty central.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.250
Bye.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.593
Hello, Dad.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.595
Listen, do you know anything
about asbestos?

07:56.935 --> 07:59.062
- Nikki!
- Jen, I need your help.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.564
Oh, my God, how are the kids?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.816
Do they have the faces of angels?
I bet they have the faces of angels.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.651
Yeah, they have the faces of angels.
I just need some super quick--

08:04.735 --> 08:07.154
Do they totally love you yet?
I bet they totally love you.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.824
- Sorry, I'm talking again.
- Terry's told me to fire someone, Jen.

08:10.908 --> 08:11.742
From sales.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.286
But I'm Jen from sales.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.956
No, I have to fire someone from sales.
And I can't say no, because then what?

08:18.040 --> 08:20.375
Then Terry fires me, then neither me
or Jason have jobs.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.003
Jen, who am I gonna fire?

08:23.086 --> 08:26.423
Okay, well, first of all,
stop saying "fire" really loudly, okay?

08:26.507 --> 08:27.758
Right, yes.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.636
Right. So, worst to best,

08:30.719 --> 08:34.347
it's Tinkle, Gentle Ben,
Straight Jo, Gay Jo,

08:34.431 --> 08:37.601
Consequence, Pork Chop,
Nico when he's sober, Dirt Baby,

08:37.683 --> 08:39.227
Nico when he's drunk, weirdly,

08:39.311 --> 08:41.395
Drew Boy and Baby Legs.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.106
Baby Legs?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.442
The strongest member of our sales team
is called Baby Legs?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.277
Since Fist left, yeah.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.030
Well, should I fire Tinkle?

08:58.372 --> 09:00.457
Okay, that's a no from me.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.750
I'm crushing on her a bit.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.335
I didn't know you--

09:03.418 --> 09:05.337
I'm a bit of everything, Nikki,
to tell you the truth.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.510
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna work with them.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.471
Maybe convince Terry
that the team is okay as it is.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.099
I need you off the phones,
listening in to their calls.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.184
But, Jen, it is a secret.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.477
It is a secret special mission.

09:21.770 --> 09:22.980
Sorry, I have to go.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.773
I have a secret special mission.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.988
Operation "improve performance quickly so
I don't have to fire anyone" starts here.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.282
This is so exciting.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.327
Sorry, I'm on a secret special mission.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.388
All right?

09:57.598 --> 09:58.432
Bloody hell.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.726
- What, has the reactor core melted down?
- Come on.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.318
Hey, mate, it's me.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.154
Do you fancy a pint?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.410
Erica's moving to Manchester.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.954
With the kids.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.415
Closer to her sister.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.501
So…

10:26.168 --> 10:29.171
Yeah, I'm a bit lonely.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.050
Anyway, just give us a call
when you get a chance. Bye.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.552
Do you know how we get
to the Odeon cinema?

10:36.261 --> 10:37.262
Yeah.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.307
You just go straight down there,
then turn right at the roundabout,

10:40.390 --> 10:41.517
and then you wanna…

10:43.310 --> 10:45.270
Actually, do you know what?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.231
I'll just walk with you.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.441
No, you don't have to do that--

10:49.525 --> 10:50.943
Nonsense! Happy to.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.445
Off we go then.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.781
So, what are you doing after? Any plans?

10:57.533 --> 10:59.284
Perhaps get a lunch or something?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.794
You know what you're looking for, yeah?

11:08.877 --> 11:09.711
- Yep.
- All right.

11:09.795 --> 11:13.465
I did roof pitches
back in the day with Jimmy Two Legs.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.051
Only got one arm.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.511
Focus on the positives.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.683
- Well, any asbestos?
- No, clean as a whistle.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.601
Well, that's just bloody typical, innit?

11:24.685 --> 11:26.728
Not even a bit? A smidge?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.313
No, not even a touch of damp.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.066
Well, can you…

11:33.026 --> 11:34.152
put asbestos in somewhere?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.863
- No, you can't.
- No, of course not.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.656
Not anymore.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.742
Well, that's just my life all over, innit?

11:41.326 --> 11:42.452
What's all this about?

11:42.536 --> 11:45.622
Well, we're thinking about
trying to buy this place, you know?

11:45.706 --> 11:47.291
If the price is right.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.003
And listen, I hate to ask you--

11:51.086 --> 11:53.797
- Well, it's a nightmare, innit, buying?
- Yeah.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.633
We've just put a deposit down
on a villa in Alicante.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.760
You haven't.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.097
Used my Tillson's money.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.557
Cleaned us out.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.435
But your mum's made up.

12:09.062 --> 12:09.938
Bloody hell, mate.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.649
That's come out of nowhere, innit, hey?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.860
Well, that's good. That's great!

12:14.943 --> 12:16.820
- Right.
- Yeah.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.156
You know they put fish
in everything over there?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.325
Even the onion rings?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.534
No, that's not the--

12:24.036 --> 12:25.162
Don't worry about it.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.922
Is Tinkle offering people

12:35.005 --> 12:37.049
- the collision damage waiver?
- No.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.885
- Maybe you should tell her to do that.
- Yep.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.555
Also, tell her she looks super cute
in her Docs.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.473
Right.

12:45.724 --> 12:49.228
Hi. Tinkle, are you offering people
the collision damage waiver?

12:49.311 --> 12:50.729
- Yeah, I am.
- Okay, good.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.566
- The other thing.
- No.

12:54.650 --> 12:55.734
The Docs.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.404
Also, Jen says you look super cute
in your Docs.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.124
I mean, this is amazing.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.627
It's insane.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.088
We never have this few complaints.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.339
Rentals are up.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.259
This is <i>War of the Worlds</i>, apocalypse,
flee-the-city levels of van hire.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.678
- Jen, is there an apocalypse on?
- Hold on…

13:25.639 --> 13:26.682
Yeah, no, we're fine.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.976
I don't believe it.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.104
So, in one day,
you've turned the whole company around.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.022
- You are amazing.
- No, I don't know about that.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.440
No, seriously.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.442
They would've just fired someone
and ruined their life,

13:37.526 --> 13:39.027
but you didn't let that happen.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.362
That's amazing.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.698
Thanks for asking me to help you.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.659
- No, don't be silly.
- No, I mean it.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.662
Feels good to be part of a team.
You know, a proper one.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.206
Not just an ironic hashtag
after a reality couple breakup.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.834
No one ever believes in me.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.378
Thank you.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.808
Oh, no.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.944
Oh, no.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.457
Weirdo.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.181
Hello, mate.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.142
<i>Mon ami.</i>

14:52.226 --> 14:53.685
There he is, nice to see you.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.771
You too.
How comes you're not in the office?

14:56.355 --> 14:57.940
Well, "the office"--

14:58.023 --> 15:00.943
It's just a state of mind really,
isn't it? You know?

15:01.568 --> 15:05.531
Plus, I lost my pass, so I'm just here
working on the blog. Yeah.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.742
- Insider blog on the banking industry.
- Okay.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.286
Allows me to say what I want when I want.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.081
And rest assured, I do.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.666
Do you? That's good. Wicked.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.211
Listen, Scott, I need your help, mate.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.004
- Here I be.
- Brilliant.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.006
You know-- Look, 'cause I don't--

15:23.090 --> 15:26.301
I don't know anything about banking
and all that, and I don't trust it.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.262
I'm more of a "cash in hand" sorta bloke.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.638
But we are family now,

15:29.721 --> 15:33.433
and, you know,
I see us as brothers? In a way.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.561
- Well, that means a lot.
- Yeah.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.729
- You know I've always wanted a brother.
- Yeah.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.357
I mean, I have two,
but they don't like me.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.942
That's--

15:42.901 --> 15:43.944
That's sad.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.821
So, we wanna buy the flat.

15:47.239 --> 15:49.616
- You wanna buy a flat?
- Yeah.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.036
- In London?
- Yes. Our flat. Yeah.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.331
- Your flat in London?
- Yes, we want to buy our flat in London.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.667
But We need a deposit,

15:58.750 --> 16:02.588
and I can't ask my dad because he's buying
this retirement place in Spain.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.589
Right.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.674
And me and Nikki,
we simply haven't got enough.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.510
- How "not enough"?
- Well, we need to double it quickly.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.095
- Wow.
- Yes, and quickly.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.806
I mean, is that something
you think you might be able to do?

16:12.890 --> 16:15.142
Hey. It's my job.

16:15.225 --> 16:19.354
Yes. Okay, but, mate,
I need a big return, all right?

16:19.438 --> 16:21.023
So none of those ethical investments.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.900
Like, I want dark web shit.

16:22.983 --> 16:27.237
Like puppy farms, land mines, wet wipes,
those sorts of things.

16:27.321 --> 16:28.197
Understood.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.824
Yeah, and it's probably best
you don't tell Nikki about it though.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.576
Just for the time being, all right?

16:32.659 --> 16:38.707
And, Scott, I really, really cannot afford
to lose this money.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.376
I hear you. That's okay.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.629
I can't afford to lose another brother.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.091
Jason.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.177
- Hey!
- Yeah.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.304
You can rely on me.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.934
That's a candle.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.444
Okay, where are we?

17:07.528 --> 17:10.739
So I took Jen off the phones,
and we listened in to the others.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.867
I thought that if I could coach them
to be a bit better, then--

17:13.951 --> 17:16.369
Sales are up. Complaints are down.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.788
Well done. Big improvement.

17:17.871 --> 17:18.872
Yeah…

17:20.082 --> 17:21.791
Yeah, no. Not really.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.877
Complaints are down, Terry.

17:23.961 --> 17:27.256
They're down by the exact number of people
who normally complain about Jen.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.758
- Right.
- Yeah, and the sales are up

17:29.842 --> 17:32.427
because callers are getting through
to people who are not Jen.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.887
So?

17:34.596 --> 17:35.764
Yeah.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.898
- I'm gonna have to fire Jen.
- Wow.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.527
Okay.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.070
Yep.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.446
Which one's Jen?

18:18.557 --> 18:19.391
The rock.

18:20.851 --> 18:21.852
Damn it.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.577
Hello. Yeah, hello.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.078
Hello, mate. Are you busy?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.511
Thank you, Shanice.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.055
That's really coming on.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.139
Okay…

19:00.766 --> 19:02.935
Tyler, would you like to come up?

19:27.501 --> 19:29.336
This is my rock.

19:29.419 --> 19:33.340
It's magic, and it has special powers.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.678
Weirdo.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.057
Oh, no. Hurry up. Come on.

19:45.227 --> 19:49.690
Hi. Sorry, can you let us through there,
please? There's this, rock.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.233
Okay.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.366
Thank you.

19:59.449 --> 20:03.120
Why don't you tell us
why you wanted to show us the rock?

20:11.086 --> 20:12.671
Government scientists.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.047
Stay where you are.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.091
Everyone, stay calm.
There's no need to panic.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.343
- It's okay.
- Ready?

20:23.223 --> 20:25.225
Easy.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.729
Stay nice and still, please, young man.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.483
- Is this the rock?
- We have to be certain.

20:38.447 --> 20:39.531
Oh, boy.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.576
My goodness.
It's stronger than we thought.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.704
All right, everybody.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.248
- Stay calm and do not look directly at it.
- Don't move.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.416
Don't look at it.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.543
Cover your eyes.

20:53.921 --> 20:54.838
Okay.

20:55.923 --> 20:59.885
- Good boy. Come on.
- Gently.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.262
Careful. Care--

21:06.058 --> 21:07.226
It's okay.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.061
Great work, Tyler. Great work.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.230
What about them?

21:11.313 --> 21:12.648
They've seen too much.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.565
Shall I--

21:13.649 --> 21:14.900
- No!
- No!

21:14.983 --> 21:17.819
No, we can trust them.
Listen, we were not here.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.488
This never happened.

21:20.197 --> 21:21.448
This is a normal rock.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.325
It is not from outer space,

21:23.408 --> 21:28.038
and it does not, I repeat, not have
any special powers whatsoever.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.165
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

21:30.832 --> 21:31.708
Young man…

21:33.210 --> 21:36.421
You're a credit to your class,
your school and your family.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.011
Over and out.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.100
If you develop any superpowers whatsoever,

21:48.767 --> 21:51.311
call this number. Okay?

21:58.527 --> 22:01.613
Okay, everyone.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.451
- Thanks for that, mate.
- No worries.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.412
So, you wanna do another school or--

22:08.495 --> 22:10.831
What? No. What?

22:11.915 --> 22:12.958
Nothing.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.252
Just a bit lonely.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.714
- Don't want to hang out?
- I can't, mate. Sorry.

22:18.797 --> 22:21.049
I've gotta get back to the house
and do kids' tea.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.218
Yeah. For sure.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.679
- Thank you.
- Laters.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.348
- So, what you having?
- Fajitas.

22:28.849 --> 22:29.808
Nice.

22:29.892 --> 22:33.228
I prefer a dry rub to a marinade,
particularly for your leaner meats.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.856
Please don't be talking to me
about dry rub.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.424
Okay, so, what is the plan with the rock?

23:02.508 --> 23:03.675
I don't know.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.512
I think it's just a phase. It's just--

23:06.595 --> 23:08.722
It's just unfortunate
that it's our first phase.

23:10.682 --> 23:13.352
You know, I really missed them
when I was at work.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.853
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.231
I figure, if I'm gonna spend time
with people I barely know

23:17.314 --> 23:20.234
and struggle to make small talk with,
it may as well be my kids.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.277
- Listen.
- Yeah?

23:22.361 --> 23:23.904
I need to tell you something.

23:25.739 --> 23:28.075
'Kay…

23:33.163 --> 23:36.124
Sarah and Chrissie aren't moving.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.459
Good.

23:37.543 --> 23:39.086
- It's us.
- What?

23:40.003 --> 23:43.090
They're selling our flat. Yeah.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.509
- What?
- Yeah.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.052
- Are you kidding?
- No.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.429
- But-- What--
- No. Jase--

23:49.513 --> 23:51.390
No, but-- What are we gonna do?

23:51.473 --> 23:52.724
We're gonna buy it.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.977
What do you mean,
"We're gonna buy it"? How?

23:55.060 --> 23:57.396
I just said to 'em, "We'll buy it."
It was actually pretty easy.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.439
No, we don't have the money for that.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.900
My dad's gonna lend it to us.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.487
- Really? What? No, it--
- Yeah.

24:05.571 --> 24:08.198
- Is that enough?
- Uh-huh, could be.

24:08.282 --> 24:10.993
Listen. But, we might have to
put the wedding on hold for a bit,

24:11.076 --> 24:13.912
and it's gonna take time to come through.
He needs to move stuff around.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.455
Oh, my God!

24:15.539 --> 24:18.917
It's gonna take a while to come through.
And, listen to me.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.919
He feels a bit awkward about it,
all right?

24:21.003 --> 24:23.005
- Keep it to yourself. Okay?
- It's amazing.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.508
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

24:26.592 --> 24:29.094
- I'm gonna get some more wine.
- Go on then. Okay.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.597
It is good. It is--
