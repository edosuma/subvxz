00:02.750 --> 00:03.830
Previously on "Kevin
Saves the World"...

00:03.830 --> 00:05.120
-I'm a messenger from God.
-Oh, good.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.750
I'm here to guide
and protect you.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.250
The only job
you have in life

00:08.250 --> 00:09.580
is to build up
your spiritual powers

00:09.580 --> 00:12.750
through acts of kindness
and selflessness.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.960
God is gonna show you how
to find the other righteous

00:14.960 --> 00:17.750
and then you'll anoint them
with an embrace.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.040
When are you
gonna ask Amy out?

00:20.040 --> 00:22.540
I'd be very happy to go out
on a date with you.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.670
They actually opened a
substitute-teacher position.

00:24.670 --> 00:27.000
Seeing as you were so good
with my students the other day,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.330
I submitted your name.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.330
Oh, we gotta go, we gotta go,
we gotta go, we gotta go.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.750
We gotta go! We gotta go!
We gotta go!

00:33.750 --> 00:35.040
What is wrong?

00:35.040 --> 00:36.790
I know where the next
righteous person is!

00:36.790 --> 00:39.120
-How's that even poss--
-The Universe! The vision!

00:39.120 --> 00:40.420
-Let's go! Now! Let's go.
-Kevin. Kevin!

00:40.420 --> 00:41.620
-Let's go. Go, go now.
-Oh, oh.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.710
Let's go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

00:43.710 --> 00:47.790
Seriously, it was the strangest,
coolest vision yet.

00:47.790 --> 00:50.500
I was at some old temple
in Peru.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.710
And there was this golden idol
on top of this old pedestal.

00:53.710 --> 00:55.420
But get this -- the pedestal
was booby-trapped.

00:55.420 --> 00:56.710
Ohh.

00:56.710 --> 00:59.000
So I had to do something.
And I had a bag of sand.

01:00.830 --> 01:02.960
And then the princess
and I kissed

01:02.960 --> 01:05.080
right before the guards
yanked me away.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.420
Then she calls out, and she
tells me that she loves me.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.420
And I just simply tell her,
"I know."

01:10.420 --> 01:11.960
I know.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.500
So we are struggling.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.290
And I find the ripcord
for his parachute,

01:16.290 --> 01:17.750
and I -- and I pull it!

01:17.750 --> 01:19.210
And then -- whoosh!
He's goes flying out.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.620
And he's hanging there
in midair.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.580
And I grab him by his shirt,
and I just growl,

01:22.580 --> 01:24.000
"Get off my plane!"

01:26.380 --> 01:29.170
Okay. I have
a confession to make.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.080
There was no vision.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.290
Yeah. Wait. When did you
figure that out?

01:33.290 --> 01:34.960
When the one-armed man
framed you

01:34.960 --> 01:36.330
for the murder
of your wife.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.710
Okay.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.040
Well, I planned us
a celebratory dinner

01:40.040 --> 01:41.670
in honor of our partnership

01:41.670 --> 01:43.210
and everything
that it's led to...
Ohh.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.250
...namely me getting
a new job.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.880
Uh, we also found
a righteous person.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.500
-That too.
-Uh-huh.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.170
So tonight,
it's just you and me

01:51.170 --> 01:54.040
having a real meal
like real people.
Ohh.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.170
Sop just make yourself
visible.

01:56.170 --> 01:57.670
Not a chance.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.920
But that's why we came
all the way out here, though.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.750
We're 70 miles from home.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.920
So no one will recognize us.
There's no danger.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.750
And honestly, I'd rather not
spend the night as a loon

02:07.750 --> 02:09.460
who eats with his
invisible friend.

02:09.460 --> 02:10.920
Then we'll eat
in silence.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.920
Come on!

02:12.920 --> 02:16.040
Just tonight. It'll be
so much fun. I promise.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.880
Plea-- Ple--
Yvette, please.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.920
Just one thing for me?

02:21.460 --> 02:24.330
Fine! But I'm not gonna
have a good time.

02:26.290 --> 02:29.210
This. Is. Incredible!

02:29.210 --> 02:30.750
What'd I tell you?

02:30.750 --> 02:33.880
I mean, I haven't been witness
to something this breathtaking

02:33.880 --> 02:37.080
in -- in at least
2,000 years!

02:37.080 --> 02:38.830
-Oh, here we go.

02:38.830 --> 02:40.210
Oh! What!

02:44.210 --> 02:46.210
Isn't this the best?

02:46.210 --> 02:49.250
Me, a teacher...
you, a student...

02:49.250 --> 02:51.790
us being around each other
all day long?

02:51.790 --> 02:53.920
Please don't
embarrass me.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.460
I'm sorry,
Reese! I can't walk you
to class right now!

02:56.460 --> 02:59.540
I am a teacher, so I have to
go to the Teachers' Lounge.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.210
But I'll see you at snack
and recess and lunch, and --

03:02.210 --> 03:03.420
Woman: Hey!
Ooh, sorry.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.210
Thought that was
the Teachers' Lounge.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.580
Does anyone know
where the...?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.120
Kevin: Gotta admit...

03:11.120 --> 03:13.330
I like what I'm
seeing around here.

03:13.330 --> 03:15.460
Solid Danish selection.
Unlimited refills.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.040
Mm-hmm.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.080
More importantly, how you
feeling about your first day?

03:19.080 --> 03:22.080
Oh. Me?
Couldn't be better.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.040
Just raring to...get out there
and touch some kids.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.080
-In their minds.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.670
-Wait. Is that -- No.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.000
Did you bring in your own --
c

03:33.000 --> 03:34.420
This thing?

03:34.420 --> 03:35.880
From a New York City
bookstore in New York City,

03:35.880 --> 03:37.330
where I used to live?

03:37.330 --> 03:38.750
Oh, God.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.830
You're trying to be the
"cool teacher," aren't you?

03:40.830 --> 03:43.620
Oh, look.
I'm just being me.
Mm-hmm.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.330
You know, if that's considered
cool, who am I to argue?

03:47.750 --> 03:50.170
Well, we, uh, we already have
a "cool teacher" here.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.460
Hey, Sean!

03:51.460 --> 03:53.170
Hey. Uh, Come meet
Kevin Finn.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.830
He's one of the new
substitute teachers.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.420
Hey. Sean Pelcovitz.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.000
The students call him
"The Pelc."

03:59.000 --> 04:00.460
-Hey. Cool mug.
-Ahh.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.000
You go to New York
a lot?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.710
Oh, I-I actually lived there
for 15 years. Not a big deal.

04:05.710 --> 04:08.120
Almost moved there myself after
I graduated from Columbia.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.080
Yeah, well, you know, it's a --
it's a tough city.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.210
It's not for everyone.
Totally.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.000
I ended up volunteering
in Indonesia

04:15.000 --> 04:18.120
for a few years instead,
mostly remote villages.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.580
Oh.
Yeah.

04:19.580 --> 04:22.750
It was one of the most rewarding
experiences of my life.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.210
Yeah. I -- I once went
upstate for a charity --

04:25.210 --> 04:26.750
Oh, that's our cue.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.380
Oh, yeah.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.620
Hey. Great talking, Kevin.
And good luck today.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.960
-I'm sure you'll do great.
-Oh, yeah.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.290
I know.
Bye, Sean.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.920
I know that!

04:34.920 --> 04:36.540
Boy.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.750
Talk about somebody who
tries too hard, huh? Yeesh.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.710
You're ridiculous.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.620
"I'm so worldly and cultured."

04:51.710 --> 04:53.080
Oh. I'm just gonna...

04:53.080 --> 04:54.380
Oh.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.040
Hi. I'm sorry.
Parking was just -- Ugh.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.380
God. Um...

04:58.380 --> 05:00.290
You weren't really
waiting long, were you?

05:00.290 --> 05:02.250
No, no, no. Not at all.
Not at all. You're good.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.460
Um, I just wanted
to clarify --

05:04.460 --> 05:06.540
this isn't actually
our first date, is it?

05:06.540 --> 05:08.080
No! No, no, no.
Definitely not.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.290
Okay, good.
This is just --

05:09.290 --> 05:11.500
Just a friendly meal.
Yes, exactly.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.620
Right. Because if it were
our first date, I mean...

05:13.620 --> 05:15.210
We would be doing
something special.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.500
-And not just breakfast.
-Yeah.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.040
So, do you, um --
Do you have any ideas?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.540
Believe it or not, I do.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.120
Okay.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.670
Midnight stroll...
Okay.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.170
...to a picnic
under the sky.

05:26.170 --> 05:29.000
I know the perfect place for
stargazing this time of year.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.540
Huh.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.380
Um...counter

05:33.380 --> 05:34.580
Go ahead.

05:34.580 --> 05:36.460
-Of course.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.670
So -- Okay, so we're
not necessarily tied

05:38.670 --> 05:41.170
to the whole "dinner, drinks,
get to know you" kind of date.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.000
We could maybe --
I don't know --

05:43.000 --> 05:44.790
try something
more adventurous?

05:44.790 --> 05:46.170
More adventurous
than Cassiopeia,

05:46.170 --> 05:48.460
"Queen of the Night Sky"?

05:48.460 --> 05:50.210
I mean, I could bring
my telescope, I guess.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.000
No. I'll think
of something.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.000
Showtime.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.960
Good morning, fine students
of La Salle High School.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.750
My name is Mr. Finn,

06:03.750 --> 06:05.880
and I will be your
substitute teacher for the day.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.790
Ms. O'Neil's norovirus pain
has become my gain.

06:10.790 --> 06:12.790
So, um...

06:12.790 --> 06:14.210
"My gain." Oh, oh!

06:14.210 --> 06:17.000
Also, you change the "I"
to a "U,"

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I become Mr. Funn!

06:20.460 --> 06:22.750
Mr. Funn. Okay, we --
Yvette: Third row.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.460
Third row. Passing notes.
Third row, Kevin.

06:25.460 --> 06:30.330
We are going to be
making learning funn-nn.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.580
Fun-n.

06:31.580 --> 06:34.080
Okay. You know what?

06:34.080 --> 06:37.540
Let's just, uh -- Let's see
what's first on today's agenda.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.710
Oh. "Return graded papers
to students."

06:39.710 --> 06:41.710
Please raise your hand
when I call your name

06:41.710 --> 06:43.120
so that I know who you are.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.120
Lola Jane. Ah.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.750
You got bonus points
for excellent penmanship,

06:48.750 --> 06:50.380
so good on you.

06:50.380 --> 06:51.920
Maya Thompson.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.420
Surfing Twitter
on a cellphone!

06:54.420 --> 06:56.170
Kevin, it's time to
confiscate. Come on, now.

06:58.170 --> 06:59.380
Here you go.

06:59.380 --> 07:02.120
Adam Hargrove?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.540
Anyone?

07:03.540 --> 07:04.540
Yes. Lola.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.620
-Adam's over there.
-Thank you.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.790
I will hold onto this
until he is back in school.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.290
Um

07:11.290 --> 07:14.000
I meant to say Adam's
sitting over there.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.170
Sitting at his desk.

07:19.330 --> 07:22.080
You mean, uh, this
empty desk right here?

07:22.080 --> 07:25.290
Ahh. Messing with
the substitute teacher.

07:25.290 --> 07:27.540
I get it.
I've done it, okay?

07:27.540 --> 07:28.750
Well played.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.540
You really
don't see him?

07:33.380 --> 07:34.790
Kevin: Oh!

07:34.790 --> 07:38.380
Uh, you must be...Adam.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.290
Why do you think the boy
was invisible to you?

07:40.290 --> 07:41.750
Clearly, it was a sign
from the Universe,

07:41.750 --> 07:43.710
but what does it mean?

07:43.710 --> 07:46.080
I really can't do this.
Of course you can.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.880
It's the first day.
Don't get too discouraged.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.960
No, I can't do this...
with you.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.000
Excuse me?
I'm --

07:55.540 --> 07:57.420
Hey!

07:57.420 --> 07:59.170
You are too much
of a distraction.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.540
Look. Don't blame me
for that hacky

08:00.540 --> 08:02.620
open-mic material
back there, Kevin.

08:02.620 --> 08:05.920
I'm just saying that
I-I can't focus on teaching

08:05.920 --> 08:08.920
when I'm listening to you
half the time.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.420
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.960
I see.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.540
Well, maybe lay low
for a while?

08:15.540 --> 08:16.920
Uh, hang out somewhere.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.460
Just -- Just --
Just during school.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.710
Look. For the record,
there are plenty of other things

08:20.710 --> 08:22.380
that I could be doing.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.670
Well, that's great!
That's perfect.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.540
You could -- Y-You
could go do that stuff.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.120
And -- And we can
maybe catch up later.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.540
Okay?

08:30.540 --> 08:32.580
Well, okay?!

08:32.580 --> 08:34.790
B-- Bye!

08:36.750 --> 08:38.250
Oh. Bye.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.830
Ugh!

08:45.830 --> 08:48.250
Ohh.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.460
Hola, ladies.

08:51.460 --> 08:52.960
What's the good word?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.620
Aren't you
supposed to be working?

08:54.620 --> 08:57.500
Just craving a little lunch hang
with my favorite niece.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.250
You guys need any Reese
fun facts

09:01.250 --> 09:03.540
Her "My Little Pony" phase?
I got a lot of dirt.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.750
I like dirt.
Yeah?

09:04.750 --> 09:06.830
Uh, why don't you guys
head off?

09:06.830 --> 09:08.330
I'll catch up
with you later.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.330
Okay.

09:11.670 --> 09:14.080
Did you actually need something,
or was this just to torture me?

09:14.080 --> 09:18.380
Yes. I need some info
on Adam Hargrove.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.330
And the torture
was just a bonus.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.880
Why are you asking
about Adam?

09:22.880 --> 09:26.120
Because I'm a teacher
and I say so.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.540
That's not how
teaching works!

09:27.540 --> 09:29.460
Okay, whatever.
Do you know him?

09:29.460 --> 09:31.040
Are you doing your whole
"helping thing"

09:31.040 --> 09:32.620
here at school now?

09:32.620 --> 09:34.790
Maybe.

09:34.790 --> 09:37.540
All right.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.880
Adam used to get picked on
a lot in middle school.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.080
He's kind of
an easy target.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.750
These days, he pretty much
just keeps to himself.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.000
Is there any particular place
that I can find him?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.580
Check the library?
Hmm.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.080
He spends a lot of time there
to avoid the knuckleheads.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.170
Huh.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.170
Eww.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.790
Okay.
Well, thank you.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.920
What?
Can you loan me 5 bucks
for lunch money?

10:04.920 --> 10:07.540
Oh, my God!
I am so hungry,
and I forgot my wallet.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.290
Kevin: Hey.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.580
Mr. Finn.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.290
I remember.

10:18.290 --> 10:21.920
I just wanted to apologize for
what happened in class earlier.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.290
It's -- First-day jitters.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.290
Um, but I-I'm really sorry.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.710
-It's fine.
-Well, no, it's not.

10:29.710 --> 10:33.330
Um, couldn't help but notice
you're eating lunch

10:33.330 --> 10:35.460
all by yourself in
the reference section.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.250
It's much better than
being picked on and
tossed into lockers.

10:38.250 --> 10:41.250
Hm.

10:41.250 --> 10:44.830
Well, maybe I could,
uh, help you with that.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.880
Ohh.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.880
Yeah. N-No, thanks.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.080
But I'm your --
I'm your teacher.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.710
I'm supposed to help.

10:55.710 --> 10:57.670
You're a substitute.

11:00.460 --> 11:05.830
Look. I am trying to do this
the cool way, as a friend.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.960
But if you won't help me
help you,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.830
then I'm gonna be forced
to go full teacher,

11:09.830 --> 11:12.460
because my trouble radar
is goin' off.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.380
I'm finding out
what's going on here.

11:16.380 --> 11:19.620
But...
I didn't do anything.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.040
Then you shouldn't have a
problem talking to me about it.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.420
Please. I don't -- I don't
want to get involved
with those guys.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.380
I'm just trying to
keep my head down.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.670
With what -- With what --
With who?

11:31.170 --> 11:33.000
With the Freshman Prank.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.620
Ohh.

11:35.620 --> 11:37.380
Tell me more.

11:37.380 --> 11:40.580
Some kids were talking about it
in the locker room after gym.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.790
They were bragging
about this year's prank.

11:42.790 --> 11:47.120
They swore me to secrecy,
but I had nothing to do with it.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.210
I wouldn't do anything
like that to Miss Allen.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.290
Kristin?

11:55.330 --> 11:56.710
Kristin: Well,
this is quite the coup.

11:56.710 --> 11:58.170
First day on the job,
and you're already

11:58.170 --> 11:59.290
taking down the
Freshman Prank?

11:59.290 --> 12:00.420
Impressive.
What'd you think was gonna

12:00.420 --> 12:02.210
happen on my first day,
something unimpressive?

12:02.210 --> 12:04.580
How did you even
find out about this?

12:04.580 --> 12:07.250
Oh, you know, I can't reveal
my source, Kristin.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.420
Listen.
I'm just stunned that the man

12:09.420 --> 12:12.000
behind one of the greatest
Freshman Pranks of all time --

12:12.000 --> 12:13.540
The greatest.

12:13.540 --> 12:17.540
Legends are still told
about how the halls overflowed

12:17.540 --> 12:20.000
with stuffing and turkey
and gravy and potatoes,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.580
a literal
cornucopia of wonder

12:22.580 --> 12:24.540
on that fateful day
in 1995.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.000
And no one will ever
top that, so...

12:26.000 --> 12:28.290
No one will ever get a chance,
because you're busting them.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.580
No, I'm not actually
busting anyone. You are.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.040
Wait. What? Ooh!

Wait. Is that...

12:49.080 --> 12:51.330
Whoa! Is this
the Freshman Prank?!

12:53.000 --> 12:55.120
Oh, man.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.120
Could've been
a great one, too.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.500
You know who else
they called insane?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.710
Einstein.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.080
Mozart. Van Gogh.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.540
Van Gogh cut off
his own ear.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.000
But he wasn't afraid
of change.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.750
Even if I agree,
I don't know what to do.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.250
Or how to do what to do.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.250
And I have no friends
to help.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.960
That's not true.
You've got me.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.500
Oh.

19:33.500 --> 19:38.420
Mastermind of the legendary
1995 Freshman Class Prank.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.960
-Ohh.
-Keep that under wraps.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.040
You look
so much older.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.920
Look. We'll get my old crew
back together.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.040
One last time.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.790
One last job.
One last prank.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.080
Including you.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.710
So what do you say, Adam?
You in?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.210
Geez!

20:08.790 --> 20:10.420
Tyler: All right!

20:10.420 --> 20:13.330
Kyle, those potato skins
have your name all over 'em.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.120
Well, thank you all
for coming.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.620
I know I was, uh, a little
mysterious on the phone,

20:18.620 --> 20:20.580
but I want you to think back

20:20.580 --> 20:24.960
to one of the single,
shining moments of our lives.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.330
The birth
of my daughter.

20:26.330 --> 20:27.670
Yeah. Good.

20:27.670 --> 20:29.250
That's a --
T-That is a good one.

20:29.250 --> 20:33.880
But before that, when we were
all together, in high school.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.250
We were on
the same "team."

20:37.250 --> 20:38.790
Not the football team.

20:38.790 --> 20:40.620
You were the only one
on the football team.

20:40.620 --> 20:43.290
Think back to 1995.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.000
When the six of us

20:47.000 --> 20:48.790
pulled the most spectacular
Freshman Prank

20:48.790 --> 20:50.960
La Salle High School has
ever seen, will ever see.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.750
They still talk about it
to this day.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.750
-They do.
-Mm-hmm. Sure.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.670
The point is,

21:00.670 --> 21:04.170
today we have the opportunity
to do it again.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.250
I don't understand.

21:07.250 --> 21:10.170
You want to pull a prank?
At the high school?

21:10.170 --> 21:12.080
Well, not just a prank.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.250
The second-best
prank ever.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.170
Why not the best?

21:19.170 --> 21:21.540
Because of ours.
Ours was the best in '95.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.420
And you know why
we were so successful?

21:23.420 --> 21:25.750
We weren't the smartest.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.000
And we weren't the bravest.
Remember?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.620
But we were a team, okay?

21:30.620 --> 21:34.540
That prank was the purest
example of -- of camaraderie,

21:34.540 --> 21:36.790
of -- of knowing each other

21:36.790 --> 21:38.790
on the deepest,
most intimate level.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.460
We were like a machine,

21:40.460 --> 21:43.420
working together,
one goal, laser-focused.

21:45.080 --> 21:48.540
22 years ago,
we made history.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.880
Who wants to make it again?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.460
Maybe I should've said
it was to help a kid.

21:55.460 --> 21:58.170
Is it? Bonus!

21:58.170 --> 21:59.420
This is terrible, Ty.

21:59.420 --> 22:02.120
We can't do a job this big
by ourselves.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.250
Yeah, but then it's just you
and me splitting the glory pie.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.830
Nate, you cannot
shut us down. Please.

22:09.830 --> 22:12.000
-I'm in.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.460
I'm in for the prank.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.120
Just didn't want to advertise
I'm breaking the law.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.290
Nate! Thank you so much!
Do not tell Amy.

22:18.290 --> 22:20.120
Why?
-She'll narc.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.170
No offense.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.120
Kevin: Hi!

22:33.120 --> 22:35.580
Don't bother to try
and talk me out of this.

22:35.580 --> 22:36.960
I'm in deep.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.880
You really think a dumb prank
is the way to help this kid?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.170
I guarantee it.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.380
We're gonna to do this prank,
I'll get my vision,

22:44.380 --> 22:45.830
and then we'll be
one step closer

22:45.830 --> 22:48.170
to finding
our righteous person.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.250
You feeling okay?

22:51.250 --> 22:54.080
I've come to realize that
some day, if we're lucky,

22:54.080 --> 22:55.750
you'll complete
your mission.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.580
You'll anoint
all the righteous.

22:57.580 --> 22:58.880
And we'll be done.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.670
Yeah. That's the plan.

23:01.670 --> 23:03.500
But I don't think
I thought beyond that.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.580
Like, what happens to me?
I don't get to go home.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.000
You won't need me.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.330
I'll just --

23:09.330 --> 23:13.170
I'll just be alone.

won't turn the TV down...

23:27.830 --> 23:31.170
and...someone's truck is
blocking Sara Gomez's driveway.

martial-law time to me.

with your shift?

23:39.210 --> 23:40.580
Hey. Yeah.
What are you doing here?

23:40.580 --> 23:45.580
Well, I have some takeout
from Salvator's, some wine,

is in my car.

23:48.290 --> 23:49.880

go to the roof

-Amy, wait.

a little more adventurous?

through here. Um...

40:19.460 --> 40:21.380
Uh, I have to work on my
lesson plan for tomorrow.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.880
I'm subbing in chemistry.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.880
You can learn all of chemistry
in, like, an hour, right?

40:24.880 --> 40:25.920
Uh, no.
No way.
No.

Don't worry about me.
Spend time with your friends.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.040
That's what I'm doing.

40:42.830 --> 40:44.580
Wh-- I think I found it!

40:44.580 --> 40:47.420
It's a crabbing boat off
the coast of British Columbia.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.500
British Columbia.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.420
It's a big place,
but that's a great start!

40:53.420 --> 40:55.620
Okay. Try this.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.920
Ohh!

40:59.210 --> 41:02.250
Mmm! Wow!
That's delicious!

41:02.250 --> 41:04.540
It's not the food.
It's the company.

41:04.540 --> 41:07.420
And it's really sweet
for you to let me do this.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.750
But you don't have to
worry about me, Kevin.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.500
I'll be fine.

41:10.500 --> 41:14.460
You know, if we actually
finish this mission --

41:14.460 --> 41:17.830
When.
When we finish this mission.

41:17.830 --> 41:19.620
When we finish...
There you go.

changed my life.

41:27.670 --> 41:30.790
I mean, sure,
people think I'm crazy.

41:30.790 --> 41:33.210
And I get punched
a lot more.

41:33.210 --> 41:36.420
And I'm naked in front
of strangers a lot more.

41:36.420 --> 41:40.250
But, uh, I'm alive.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.710
And I'm happy.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.290
And a lot of that
is because of you.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.750
You've become
very dear to me.

41:53.710 --> 41:55.460

matching tattoos.

Like, I'll get half a heart
on my hand,

41:57.330 --> 41:58.620
and you get a half a heart
on your hand,

41:58.620 --> 42:00.460
and we put it together,
and it's, like, BFF's forever!

42:00.460 --> 42:01.830
Bam!
You just --

42:01.830 --> 42:04.380
You just ruin things.
