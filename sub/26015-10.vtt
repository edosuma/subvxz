<i>The grip leading towards</i>
<i>the needle bar,</i>

17:59.620 --> 18:01.163
<i>that line work</i>
<i>gets away from you.</i>

18:01.246 --> 18:02.664
<i>All of your</i>
<i>needle bar endings,</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:04.041
<i>they're not</i>
<i>very consistent.</i>

18:04.124 --> 18:06.085
- That's how the stencil was.

18:06.168 --> 18:06.752
- If the coach did it
all wobbly and wonky,

18:06.835 --> 18:08.045
then you've got a match.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.339
- Going up against
Cleen Rock One

18:10.422 --> 18:12.132
on his own style is super hard,
anybody knows that.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.010
And out of all
the tattoos in the room,

18:15.093 --> 18:16.970
this was my personal favorite.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.597
- Thank you.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.851
- Tim.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.019
- I thought you were
the guy that

18:24.102 --> 18:25.521
was gonna give Cleen
a run for his money.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.855
<i>How do you reach</i>
<i>for dull-ass color?</i>

18:26.939 --> 18:31.860
<i>You do brown, burgundy,</i>
<i>black, gray, muddy purple.</i>

18:31.944 --> 18:34.530
You're matching the guy
who does the brightest color

18:34.613 --> 18:37.074
that you can find,
and you go opposite.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.200
- I thought he was gonna be

18:38.283 --> 18:39.535
the one that was
gonna kill it today.

18:39.618 --> 18:40.911
<i>Probably the most</i>
<i>disappointed.</i>

18:40.994 --> 18:42.246
<i>- This is a no-go.</i>

18:42.329 --> 18:44.122
You're slipping
on color palette issues.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.545
- Amanda.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.797
- At first glance,
you definitely have a brighter,

18:51.880 --> 18:52.923
<i>sticker-esque tattoo.</i>

18:53.006 --> 18:54.466
<i>So, as far as packing in</i>
<i>this color,</i>

18:54.550 --> 18:57.219
<i>I think you do do a good job</i>
<i>in a lot of the areas.</i>

18:57.302 --> 19:00.180
But as far as this
purple background goes,

19:00.264 --> 19:01.765
I can't stand it.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.433
<i>The purple abruptly stops</i>
<i>in the background</i>

19:03.517 --> 19:05.978
<i>on the right side,</i>
<i>and doesn't continue down</i>

19:06.061 --> 19:08.021
<i>to the skull,</i>
<i>yet on the left side it does.</i>

19:08.105 --> 19:10.482
<i>- If you look in close to the</i>
<i>purple behind all these flames</i>

19:10.566 --> 19:13.485
<i>around this tube, you do see</i>
<i>a little bit of inconsistency.</i>

19:13.569 --> 19:15.487
<i>But overall,</i>
<i>it's a really bright,</i>

19:15.571 --> 19:17.239
<i>really contrast-heavy tattoo.</i>

19:17.322 --> 19:19.241
- Thank you.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.952
- Jess.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.537
<i>I'm not a fan of this one.</i>

19:23.620 --> 19:26.290
<i>Nothing is really punched in</i>
<i>anywhere in this tattoo.</i>

19:26.373 --> 19:27.708
- I'm gonna have to disagree.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.002
- You want to tell me
that orange is punched in?

19:30.085 --> 19:30.794
<i>- That orange is [bleep]</i>
<i>in there.</i>

19:30.878 --> 19:33.338
- That orange is not solid.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.091
<i>There's skin poking</i>
<i>through all over the place.</i>

19:36.174 --> 19:39.136
- This color application looks
incredibly rough, just fading

19:39.219 --> 19:41.555
<i>of red to yellow</i>
<i>through a flame,</i>

19:41.638 --> 19:42.848
<i>you missed the ball</i>
<i>completely.</i>

19:42.931 --> 19:44.641
The skull, what happened?

19:44.725 --> 19:46.184
<i>What is that black to brown?</i>

19:46.268 --> 19:48.145
- That's actually a dark red.
- It's brown.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.606
If you ask your mom what color
it is, it's [bleep] brown.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.900
This is a complete miss,
my man.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.113
- TeeJ.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.823
- This tattoo came out killer.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.742
<i>I love the stippled</i>
<i>background.</i>

20:01.825 --> 20:04.620
<i>You do a great job of keeping</i>
<i>the fade nice and consistent,</i>

20:04.703 --> 20:05.954
<i>so it was darker at the top,</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:07.623
<i>softly fades out</i>
<i>to the bottom.</i>

20:07.706 --> 20:09.291
- And I'd rather do
the stipple,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.418
knowing that it's still gonna
add more depth than do purple,

20:11.501 --> 20:13.337
<i>and you just chewed me up</i>
<i>on purple.</i>

20:13.420 --> 20:15.672
- The choice to go ahead and
do this stippling through here

20:15.756 --> 20:17.424
<i>is definitely something</i>
<i>that's your own take on it.</i>

20:17.507 --> 20:21.094
If yours looks better than his,
then good for you.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.304
I would say that
amongst everybody,

20:22.387 --> 20:25.265
you're towards the top
rather than the bottom.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.142
- I'll take it.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.268
- Now let's look
at Cleen's tattoo.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.228
- Well, it's definitely
very dynamic.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.731
<i>The way you pull off</i>
<i>the flames,</i>

20:32.814 --> 20:34.900
<i>and the flame over</i>
<i>top of the other flame,</i>

20:34.983 --> 20:36.568
<i>the transparency of</i>
<i>the needle through the flame,</i>

20:36.652 --> 20:40.072
this is obviously a more
advanced way to pull it off.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.449
One spot where you shine
is in the needles,

20:42.532 --> 20:44.034
<i>and how take so much</i>
<i>black and the white highlights</i>

20:44.117 --> 20:47.537
<i>in the needles to really give</i>
<i>them the texture and the look.</i>

20:47.621 --> 20:50.332
- The thing for me that
stands out the most is gonna be

20:50.415 --> 20:52.668
the strong outline around
the tube and the needle bar.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.337
<i>That's what really makes this</i>
<i>thing pop in the foreground</i>

20:55.420 --> 20:57.255
<i>for me, it gives it</i>
<i>a lot more dimension.</i>

20:57.339 --> 20:58.840
<i>- Overall, man,</i>
<i>I would say that</i>

20:58.924 --> 21:01.551
this is the expert level,
finesse way to tattoo.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.762
- I wanted to prove
a point that I could do a big,

21:03.845 --> 21:06.723
solid tattoo faster and better
than anybody on that team.

Let's look at
Kyle versus Christian.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.886
- I really like
what Kyle did here.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.556
<i>It is a very rich,</i>
<i>dark take on this.</i>

21:47.639 --> 21:48.890
{\an8}<i>But when you compare it</i>
<i>to Christian,</i>

21:48.974 --> 21:51.852
{\an8}<i>Christian forced his outlines</i>
<i>in by shading.</i>

21:51.935 --> 21:53.770
{\an8}<i>They kind of look</i>
<i>soft and painterly,</i>

21:53.854 --> 21:57.649
{\an8}<i>where Kyle forced his lines</i>
<i>in, they look pretty jagged.</i>

21:57.733 --> 22:00.402
It's that higher
level of the finesse.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.070
- Christian takes it.
- I agree.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.406
- Kyle, you did
not match the coach

22:04.489 --> 22:06.783
and are up for elimination.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.618
Let's take a look at
Tony versus Christian.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.830
{\an8}- Tony has some nice aspects
in the hair, but Christian's

22:11.913 --> 22:14.875
{\an8}<i>tattoo has a very deliberate,</i>
<i>soft, buttery feel.</i>

22:14.958 --> 22:17.210
{\an8}<i>- Especially how soft that is</i>
<i>under the chin,</i>

22:17.294 --> 22:19.087
{\an8}<i>and just the structure</i>
<i>of the face.</i>

22:19.171 --> 22:20.964
{\an8}<i>- Against Christian,</i>
<i>Tony falls short.</i>

22:21.048 --> 22:22.299
- I agree.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.885
Tony, you did
not match the coach,

22:24.968 --> 22:26.386
and you are up for elimination.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.388
- It was a humbling
experience.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.931
- You guys did better than I
thought, I'll tell you that.

22:30.015 --> 22:30.974
I'm also impressed.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.267
- That was one of
the hardest tattoos

22:32.350 --> 22:33.769
I've ever had
to do in my entire life.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.062
You're great at what you do,

22:35.145 --> 22:36.271
and I have nothing
but respect for you, man.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.397
- I appreciate that.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.192
- Let's look at
Turk versus Christian.

22:40.275 --> 22:43.737
{\an8}<i>- Just the contrast of what</i>
<i>Christian did with the hair</i>

22:43.820 --> 22:45.989
{\an8}<i>is very similar</i>
<i>to what you were going for,</i>

22:46.073 --> 22:47.949
{\an8}but look at the difference
with some dark in it.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.201
{\an8}<i>It immediately jumps out.</i>

22:49.284 --> 22:50.368
{\an8}<i>Christian takes</i>
<i>this one as well.</i>

22:50.452 --> 22:52.120
{\an8}- Turk, you did not
match the coach

22:52.204 --> 22:56.458
{\an8}and are up for elimination.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.794
{\an8}Let's take a look at
Tiffer versus Christian.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.545
{\an8}<i>- I really love</i>
<i>what Tiffer did.</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:03.048
{\an8}<i>Even though he went dark with</i>
<i>the hair, in a lot of areas</i>

23:03.131 --> 23:05.258
{\an8}<i>it still shows</i>
<i>the direction of the hair.</i>

23:05.342 --> 23:06.843
{\an8}<i>I kind of like</i>
<i>the different approach</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:08.637
{\an8}<i>he took from Christian on the</i>
<i>horn without the streaky lines</i>

23:08.720 --> 23:10.514
{\an8}<i>but just with the shading</i>
<i>of the striations.</i>

23:10.597 --> 23:12.933
{\an8}- Well, I am noticing
that Christian

23:13.016 --> 23:15.394
{\an8}has hair going on to her face,
and you chose to not do that.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.812
{\an8}Why is that?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.106
{\an8}- I thought that the face
looks better without the hair.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.190
{\an8}<i>I think the lips</i>
<i>are more readable.</i>

23:20.273 --> 23:21.483
{\an8}<i>I think the eye</i>
<i>is more readable.</i>

23:21.566 --> 23:23.193
{\an8}<i>- The rules</i>
<i>were line for line.</i>

23:23.276 --> 23:24.611
{\an8}- That's a big problem,
especially because

23:24.694 --> 23:26.238
{\an8}<i>the lines</i>
<i>traverse the eyes.</i>

23:26.321 --> 23:27.656
{\an8}<i>The fact that Christian</i>
<i>is able to pull this negative</i>

23:27.739 --> 23:30.200
{\an8}<i>hair and show how</i>
<i>complex that hair is,</i>

23:30.283 --> 23:33.620
Christian holds his dominance.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.163
- Tiffer, you did not
match the coach,

23:35.247 --> 23:37.374
and you are up for elimination.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.460
Let's look at
Chris versus Cleen.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.671
{\an8}Chris, although
he did a killer job,

23:42.754 --> 23:45.173
{\an8}<i>it's not as vibrant, there's</i>
<i>not as many tricks in it.</i>

23:45.257 --> 23:47.801
{\an8}<i>There's a lot more dimension</i>
<i>in Cleen's grip,</i>

23:47.884 --> 23:50.554
{\an8}<i>and certainly the burst</i>
<i>behind it is stellar.</i>

23:50.637 --> 23:52.389
{\an8}<i>- Hands down, Cleen's</i>
<i>saturation and Cleen's</i>

23:52.472 --> 23:54.558
{\an8}line work is much
stronger than Chris's.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.392
{\an8}- You're telling me
that the purple

23:55.475 --> 23:56.893
{\an8}<i>in his is more saturated?</i>

23:56.977 --> 23:59.896
{\an8}<i>- One looks like a glossy,</i>
<i>wet sticker and one doesn't.</i>

23:59.980 --> 24:03.900
- It is ten times more dynamic
on Cleen's side of the fence.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.986
- Chris, you did not
match the coach

24:06.069 --> 24:08.113
and are up for elimination.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.201
- If you guys could outshine
me, why didn't you?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.411
- This is the challenge.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.704
You try to match the level
of these guys,

24:15.787 --> 24:19.499
who are obviously
masters of their own craft.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.918
- It's kind of hard to match
somebody that does their style.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.589
- It's strictly, can you color
in a flame as bright as him?

24:25.672 --> 24:28.091
Can you shade as open
and soft as him?

24:28.175 --> 24:29.217
Can you create contrast
as he did?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.803
Can you beat him
at his own game?

24:31.887 --> 24:32.471
- If you handed me
a line drawing

24:32.554 --> 24:34.598
of one of your drawings,

24:34.681 --> 24:37.392
I would put every trick
that I had in the bag to try

24:37.475 --> 24:39.436
and outshine whatever you're
gonna do, no matter what.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.063
- I ain't even
gonna argue today.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.566
It's not even worth it.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.526
- Now let's look
at Tim versus Cleen.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.570
{\an8}- This is like
drastic night and day.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.947
{\an8}<i>Tim, there's definitely</i>
<i>saturation issues,</i>

24:51.031 --> 24:52.490
{\an8}<i>there's definitely</i>
<i>application issues.</i>

24:52.574 --> 24:53.575
{\an8}<i>It's not vibrant.</i>

24:53.658 --> 24:55.118
{\an8}- Palette choices
and saturation.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.120
{\an8}For me, this is a no-go.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.538
{\an8}- Tim, you did not
match the coach.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.875
{\an8}Amanda versus Cleen.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.794
{\an8}I love what Amanda presented
here, but when you contrast it

25:04.878 --> 25:08.048
{\an8}<i>next to Cleen's tattoo,</i>
<i>it's hard to deny</i>

25:08.131 --> 25:10.759
{\an8}<i>just how much</i>
<i>Cleen's jumps off the skin.</i>

25:10.842 --> 25:12.344
{\an8}<i>I've got to go</i>
<i>with Cleen on this.</i>

25:12.427 --> 25:13.428
{\an8}- I agree.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.972
{\an8}- Amanda, you did not
match the coach,

25:16.056 --> 25:17.224
{\an8}and you are up
for elimination.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.350
{\an8}- Cleen's a tough nut
to crack.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.268
{\an8}He's hard to beat.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.895
{\an8}- Let's look at
Jess versus Cleen.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.521
{\an8}<i>- Jess didn't put in</i>
<i>solid enough color</i>

25:23.605 --> 25:24.856
{\an8}<i>to compete with Cleen's.</i>

25:24.940 --> 25:26.524
{\an8}<i>I just don't think</i>
<i>this one's in the realm.</i>

25:26.608 --> 25:28.026
{\an8}<i>- I agree.</i>
<i>This one doesn't match up.</i>

25:28.109 --> 25:30.528
{\an8}Jess, you did
not match the coach.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.739
{\an8}Now, let's look
at TeeJ versus Cleen.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.241
{\an8}- For you doing
this style of tattooing,

25:34.324 --> 25:35.533
{\an8}<i>I think you</i>
<i>totally killed it.</i>

38:54.832 --> 38:57.376

38:57.460 --> 39:00.921

39:05.301 --> 39:08.179
some people came out with a
great creativity and killed it,

39:08.262 --> 39:09.805
and some people did
something we haven't seen from

39:09.889 --> 39:12.183
them so far, like TeeJ,
and totally killed it.

39:12.266 --> 39:15.061
