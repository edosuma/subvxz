WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.795
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.837 --> 00:05.880
Diego, this is Max.
Max, this is...

00:05.922 --> 00:06.548
The ex-fiancÃ©.

00:06.548 --> 00:09.050
Why is Kyle locked
out of your lab?

00:09.092 --> 00:10.093
What kind of work are you doing?

00:10.135 --> 00:11.803
Max, I love you.
I am asking you

00:11.845 --> 00:13.221
to trust me with this.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.473
We found this on
Michael's trailer.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.475
This is Helena's handwriting.
Helena and Flint

00:17.517 --> 00:18.893
are working together.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.062
(grunts)

00:21.104 --> 00:22.272
I want to see Alex.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.065
You will.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.568
After you build
me this bomb.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.457
(phone ringing)

00:48.840 --> 00:51.009
Hello?

00:51.051 --> 00:55.221
Uh, he's out.
Can I take a message?

00:55.263 --> 00:58.099
Yeah, let me just get a pen.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.773
Thanks, I'll let him know.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.983
(door opens)

01:08.610 --> 01:11.362
Hi. Didn't know you
were stopping by.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.697
LIZ:
Did you take a...

01:12.739 --> 01:14.115
a whole vial of my antidote?

01:15.116 --> 01:16.576
Uh, maybe.

01:16.618 --> 01:20.580
Those are from when
you were treating my amnesia.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.207
Why are you looking
through my desk?

01:22.248 --> 01:25.627
I was looking for a pen.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.671
Your bank called. They verified
that deposit you asked about.

01:29.672 --> 01:30.882
Max, a-a dose

01:30.924 --> 01:33.968
that strong could be
incredibly taxing.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.637
Liz, look at me.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.847
I'm fine.
(chuckles)

01:37.889 --> 01:39.974
You're so stressed trying to
keep me from getting stressed,

01:40.016 --> 01:43.686
it's becoming very
friggin' stressful.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.896
Okay.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.816
I'm sorry.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.194
And I'm sorry I wasn't
honest about the lab.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.156
I know
any scientific inquiry

01:55.198 --> 01:57.492
into alien physiology
scares you...

01:57.534 --> 01:59.577
but I was so scared
about hurting your heart,

01:59.619 --> 02:01.454
I-I didn't think
about hurting you.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.501
I want us to be a team.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.336
I want us to make
big choices together.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.505
And I don't want

02:10.547 --> 02:13.758
to go anywhere
you're not gonna follow me.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.177
That's all I want, too.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.179
I love you.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.099
And I'm always on your team.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.147
Once we know our friends
are safe, I'll, uh,

02:27.188 --> 02:29.274
go to the lab with you
and we can

02:29.315 --> 02:31.067
box up all that stolen equipment

02:31.109 --> 02:33.820
and return it
and destroy the evidence.

02:33.862 --> 02:38.158
It's-- I-I guess we haven't
heard anything from Michael?

02:38.199 --> 02:41.077
Uh, nothing.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.872
No, Isobel and I would know

02:43.913 --> 02:47.292
if he was badly injured
or in serious danger.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.835
So I'm choosing
not to freak out.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.171
I spoke to Helena's
boyfriend Dirk.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.381
He said before she left,
she was getting nonstop calls

02:53.423 --> 02:55.466
from a 575 number.

02:55.508 --> 02:59.053
The Sunset Mesa facility
where Mimi DeLuca lives.

02:59.095 --> 03:03.474
Wait, Mimi was calling your mom
before the abductions? Uh...

03:03.516 --> 03:05.226
Does Maria know?
<b></b>
Cell service is out

03:05.268 --> 03:06.895
because all
the tin hat-wearing tourists

03:06.936 --> 03:09.731
crowding the airwaves, but I
left her very detailed messages.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.566
Mimi was always obsessed
with alien movies.

03:11.608 --> 03:15.486
Maybe fiction and reality
are blurring.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.032
Your mom is working
with Flint Manes,

03:19.073 --> 03:21.242
who spent years making
an alien-killing weapon

03:21.284 --> 03:23.119
while at Caulfield.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.539
What if your mom found out
Rosa was killed by an alien?

03:26.581 --> 03:27.957
She'd want revenge.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.584
Then I have to find her
and tell her

03:29.626 --> 03:31.669
that an alien
also resurrected Rosa.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.796
Kyle e-mailed. He wants me
to stop by the hospital.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.298
I think he found something.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.925
So don't call your mom
till I get back, okay?

03:36.966 --> 03:39.010
Okay. Okay.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.429
You and Kyle are friends?

03:41.471 --> 03:42.722
(scoffs)
What?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.307
After you two
investigate,

03:44.349 --> 03:47.227
you can grab a beer with Diego
and compare notes.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.270
Yeah, I don't think they drink
beer. It's not keto.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.023
Listen, why don't you meet
Isobel and I at the Pony at 4:00

03:52.065 --> 03:53.942
in case we can't reach
you by phone.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.361
We'll decide
our next steps together.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.322
MARIA:
Mom?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949
I need to talk to you right now.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.408
We can go after this chapter.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.285
I just got a message from Liz.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.206
Mom... when you
disappeared,

04:08.248 --> 04:10.291
it was Helena Ortecho
that took you.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.627
(exhales):
Oh. Helena.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.880
You didn't have butyricol in
your system when they found you.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.924
You know Liz's mom.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.926
You'd remember if you
spent a month with her.

04:19.968 --> 04:24.764
Mom... are you covering
for Helena?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.517
Everything is going to be fine.

04:27.558 --> 04:31.187
I'm not fine.
Alex and Michael are missing.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.898
Helena is a lot of things,

04:33.940 --> 04:35.566
but she won't hurt your friends.
I'm sure.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.652
No.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.822
You're the blonde.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.865
The one that Rosa
was afraid of.
<b></b>
Hi, Mimi.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.450
No. Stay away from me.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.160
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.245
I'm your cool Aunt Isobel.

04:47.287 --> 04:47.870
Hopefully we can
get to know

04:47.912 --> 04:50.123
each other under better
circumstances sometime.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.084
Sure about this, DeLuca?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.920
Desperate times call
for desperate alien invasions.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.630
What are you talking about?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.925
(high-pitched ringing)

05:02.552 --> 05:04.095
ISOBEL:
Show me what happened

05:04.137 --> 05:06.180
the night you disappeared, Mimi.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.397
(gasps)
Oh, thank God you came.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.817
Mimi. My beautiful friend.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.861
MIMI:
I saw her.
I saw her in a vision.

05:19.902 --> 05:23.781
I didn't believe you. I had
to see it with my own eyes.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.116
You saw her?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.326
You saw Rosa?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.577
ROSA:
Is this my necklace?

05:27.618 --> 05:29.162
(laughter)

05:29.203 --> 05:31.039
LIZ:
I never thought
we'd get to have

05:31.080 --> 05:33.499
this stupid
fight again.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.460
This is a good
thing, Helena.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.295
Your daughter is alive.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.046
She needs you.

05:38.087 --> 05:42.925
When Jim Valenti was dying,
I came home to say goodbye.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.844
But he kept saying

05:44.886 --> 05:47.180
Rosa could live again,
that she was preserved.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.473
But you didn't believe him.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.516
No one ever believes us.

05:50.558 --> 05:55.271
If Rosa is alive, it means
Jim was telling the truth.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.775
Which means everything else
he said could be true,

05:58.816 --> 06:01.194
like aliens are real

06:01.235 --> 06:05.198
and Jesse Manes has a weapon
that can kill them.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.910
It means I have
to go to war, Mimi.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.289
First, you need some shoes.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.378
Get out of my memories, Isobel.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.546
(grunting)

06:20.588 --> 06:21.798
(huffs)

06:21.839 --> 06:23.674
God.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.468
It's just like the time
when I tried to get

06:25.510 --> 06:26.761
into your head without consent.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.970
She kicked me out.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.639
What do you mean,
get in my head?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.808
(elevator bell chimes)

06:31.849 --> 06:34.018
Hey.
<b></b>
Hey, sorry.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.145
The line for the UFO Emporium
shut down Main Street.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.397
What do you-- What you got?

06:37.438 --> 06:39.524
I found this at Flint's,

06:39.565 --> 06:40.942
but it's from a
florist my dad used

06:40.983 --> 06:42.902
when he was in the
doghouse with my mom.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.405
I finally guessed the password
today. Rosa's birthday.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.698
The only thing on it is a
note my dad wrote to Helena.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.326
It's a lot of romantic
crap followed by details

06:50.368 --> 06:52.495
for a storage unit he had
up near Haystack Mountain.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.621
Okay, let's go. I'll drive.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.747
I-I can't.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.998
I got patients to see.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.417
You're on your own this time.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.965
This entire process
would be more efficient

07:04.006 --> 07:05.883
if I could attach
the release chamber

07:05.925 --> 07:07.468
to the other side.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.513
now is not
the time to get creative.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.265
Time is running out.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.851
Follow the blueprints exactly.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.982
CHARLIE:
You don't look like
an obedient soldier.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.986
Who'd she take to force
you to do her bidding?

07:25.027 --> 07:26.195
A friend.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.740
It's complicated.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.367
Why are you helping her?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.202
Jenna's free.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.163
Flint Manes has a sniper rifle
on the roof

07:35.204 --> 07:36.789
pointed at her bedroom window.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.458
If I step out of line
and something happens to...

07:38.499 --> 07:39.959
You'll never forgive yourself.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.628
I'll never
forgive myself anyway.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.256
Helena has me
formulating a pathogen

07:45.298 --> 07:47.758
that I invented when I was 17.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.554
It's a poison
that dismantles specific DNA.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.849
If targeted, your death
is quick and ugly.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.767
A bleeding-from-every-orifice
kind of deal.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.603
Wow.

07:58.644 --> 08:02.690
If only you'd been invited
to more parties in high school.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.400
I thought that
I was saving people.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.861
Okay, imagine a weapon
that you could

08:06.903 --> 08:09.739
drop into a populated city,
and the only people targeted

08:09.780 --> 08:14.160
would be al-Qaeda leaders
and their direct descendants.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.454
Okay? In the right hands,
my weapon could prevent

08:16.496 --> 08:19.874
innocent civilian casualties
and save our troops.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.669
I'm guessing these
are not the right hands?

08:23.711 --> 08:25.129
Why am I building the bomb
when the inventor

08:25.171 --> 08:26.797
is under Helena's thumb?

08:26.839 --> 08:31.219
I do chemicals, not mechanics.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.804
And technically it's not a bomb.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.432
It's a catalytic toxin atomizer
that was developed

08:36.474 --> 08:39.644
in a top secret operation
involving weapons specialists

08:39.685 --> 08:42.647
from both the Army
and the Air Force.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.940
Project Shepherd.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.778
One more question for you,
Charlie.

08:48.819 --> 08:53.199
Whose DNA is that poison
you're making gonna target?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.327
Judging from conversations
I've heard

08:56.369 --> 09:01.624
between Helena and Flint,
it's alien DNA.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.919
Like, literal aliens.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.550
âª âª

09:19.475 --> 09:21.435
He's only supposed to take
a drop when he has amnesia.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.229
It's not vitamin C.
In high doses it could cause

09:23.271 --> 09:26.065
surges of adrenaline
that could be dangerous.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.317
No offense, but you sound
like a mom.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.320
Like a real mom, the kind
who actually gives a duck.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.533
Oh, I just figured out what
autocorrect is. It's hilarious.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.660
Speaking of moms,
ours hasn't

09:37.702 --> 09:39.412
reached out to any
of your old dealers

09:39.453 --> 09:41.414
and she hasn't showed up
at any of the churches in town,

09:41.455 --> 09:44.542
so you got any other ideas?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.836
Mm, it's CrashCon.
We usually find her wearing

09:46.877 --> 09:49.505
the loudest T-shirts and
flirting with the richest nerds.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.882
Yeah, but Flint and Jesse Manes
hate aliens.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.342
I mean, it's literally
their only hobby.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.927
(laughs softly)

09:54.969 --> 09:57.638
If she's with them, I'm betting
she's lost her affection

09:57.680 --> 10:00.349
for the simple charms
of UFO novelty-kitsch.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.852
Wait.
If you were gonna

10:02.893 --> 10:05.730
get revenge on aliens,
CrashCon is the perfect place.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.233
There's all kinds of
conspiracy theorists and press.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.860
You know how mom
loves attention.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.237
Y-You think something's
gonna happen tonight?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.239
Papi is there by himself,
setting up.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.907
I think he should come home.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.666
Getting ready for a hot date?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.126
Yeah, uh...

10:27.168 --> 10:29.170
My dad loves carnivals.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.047
Guess he just wants
to bring his dying daughter

10:31.088 --> 10:33.382
for one more dance
in the Wacky Shack.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.093
(sighs)

10:38.929 --> 10:42.475
You don't seem
up to a carnival.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.977
(sobbing)

10:45.019 --> 10:46.812
I'm not.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.939
But I love my dad.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.776
Though I'm not sure he'll be
able to enjoy himself

10:51.817 --> 10:53.152
if I look like a corpse.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.072
And my fingers
are really numb.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.574
So...

11:01.702 --> 11:03.454
What are you doing?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.164
Honestly...

11:05.206 --> 11:07.458
I have no idea.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.793
Let's see.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.878
Talk me through it.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.963
I'm not gonna let you
put that on me.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.048
Steph...

11:14.090 --> 11:15.049
I'm a surgeon.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.842
Steady hands.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.511
Okay.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.599
Let's see.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.601
For the record...

11:25.643 --> 11:29.105
you don't need it.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.941
You don't have
to lie to me.

11:35.152 --> 11:39.699
I know I look like the hospital
ghost of your wildest dreams.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.162
Look, I just want
to look like, like me.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.664
I get it.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.339
Well, thanks for
the assist.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.633
I'm guessing that guard wouldn't
let me through with bolt cutters

11:57.675 --> 11:59.635
unless I had an officer
of the law present.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.638
Oh, well, don't be
jealous, Evans.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.099
Valenti has me
on desk duty.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.060
So this little adventure
is my lunch break.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.272
Valenti did the right thing,
giving you your job back.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.857
Yeah, well,

12:12.898 --> 12:14.608
you know, apparently
some local bartender

12:14.650 --> 12:15.985
gave her reason to doubt

12:16.026 --> 12:18.612
the events the night
of the gala were my fault.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.323
So... I owe you.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.868
I've lost track of who owes
who what at this point.

12:23.909 --> 12:24.869
Yeah.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.246
Well, this is the one.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.998
Shall we?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.086
Whoa.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.547
What is that?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.882
It looks like embryonic fluid.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.551
There must've been
a pod in here.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.886
And I'm officially
in too deep.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.637
I understood
literally all of that.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.474
You know, I miss the, uh,
misty water-colored days

12:46.515 --> 12:48.434
of managing rowdy
drunk rednecks

12:48.476 --> 12:50.644
and meth heads.
<b></b>
Yeah, well, you know,

12:50.686 --> 12:52.563
once we get my sister back,
I'm gonna need

12:52.605 --> 12:54.815
a fifth of whiskey
and some supervision,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.984
so half of that
might come true.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.611
Bolt cutters.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.862
Thanks.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.540
CAMERON:
Look, Watson.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.250
A clue.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.086
I'm not Watson, you're Watson.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.047
You're definitely Watson.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.132
Mmm.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.551
Okay there.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.262
Okay, I'm ready
to jump back in there,

13:25.304 --> 13:27.348
find out about
her month on the lam.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.975
Take off that bracelet,
I can bring you in with me.

13:30.017 --> 13:34.104
You go. I'll wait here in case
you pass out off that chair.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.273
I think that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.776
We just had
the floors done.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.575
Mimi...

13:46.617 --> 13:48.536
I know you think
you're doing

13:48.577 --> 13:51.580
the right thing, but Helena
is holding people hostage.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.582
We have to understand
her motive.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.085
You all think
I'm losing my mind.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.421
But I just...
slip out of my time

13:59.463 --> 14:01.465
and into a different one
every once in a while.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.093
Sometimes Maria's.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.636
Or Mama's.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.557
Other women
in our future or past.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.476
I saw you when you were a baby.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.645
The sky was red.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.232
What can you tell me
about your time with Helena?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.401
She had you for a month.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.488
We were in a motel.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.740
We watched movies.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.785
We laughed and gossiped.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.830
She wanted to trigger
my visions...

14:32.872 --> 14:34.248
gather information.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.499
What information?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.917
What did you tell her?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.002
What did you see?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.337
What's important is,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.882
Helena will take
care of our girls.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.383
I'm not afraid.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.094
That's enough.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.017
I tried.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.268
She's fading.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.561
She's tired.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.229
It's harder
when she's tired.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.480
Come on, Mom.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.774
I'll take you back
to Sunset Mesa.

15:00.816 --> 15:05.154
Maria, you just have to look
for the signs in the water.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.864
You have to believe.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.910
Go on, you'd better hurry.

15:10.951 --> 15:11.994
Hurry where?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.829
CrashCon closing night!

15:13.871 --> 15:15.289
You don't want to
miss the fireworks.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.375
(chuckles)
<b></b>
You always loved the fireworks.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.213
(paper rustling)

15:23.255 --> 15:25.507
MAX:
Okay, all these notes are

15:25.549 --> 15:26.926
from Helena to Jim Valenti.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.844
This is from the week Rosa died.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.471
I mean, even 20 years
after their affair,

15:30.512 --> 15:32.848
she's still writing and
he's still saving her letters.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.643
Ah, pining after an Ortecho
for years and years.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.311
It's so weird.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.646
Who does that?

15:38.687 --> 15:40.522
This is a...

15:40.564 --> 15:42.650
this is a receipt.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.361
It's a money transfer he
made around the same time.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.656
He paid Daniel Fuller
a thousand bucks.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.242
Fuller was
the county coroner.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.997
Okay, we still
don't know how Noah

15:57.039 --> 15:59.333
got Rosa's body
into the pod, right?

15:59.375 --> 16:02.044
But Jim had Project Shepherd
connections to the morgue.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.129
So maybe if Noah
knew about Jim

16:04.171 --> 16:05.631
and knew that
he'd be grieving Rosa,

16:05.673 --> 16:07.549
he could have told Jim
where to find the pod,

16:07.591 --> 16:09.718
right, and-and maybe he didn't
even take the pod

16:09.760 --> 16:11.470
back until after Jim died.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.555
I mean, this is all

16:13.597 --> 16:15.391
a bunch of conjecture, I...

16:15.432 --> 16:17.434
Jim pulled me aside at high
school graduation, he said

16:17.476 --> 16:19.561
I was the kind of guy the
sheriff's department could use.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.563
Look, I mean, maybe...
I mean, he never let on,

16:21.605 --> 16:22.898
but maybe he knew
I was an alien, right?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.775
Maybe he knew more than that.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.026
Okay, Evans?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.236
Breathe. You're...

16:27.277 --> 16:28.612
you're looking a little clammy.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.864
What's going on?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.408
Nothing. (chuckles)

16:32.449 --> 16:34.076
No, see?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.911
Something's going on,
and you're gonna tell me

16:35.953 --> 16:37.496
or I'm out, I swear to God.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.373
Okay, you can't tell anyone.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.333
Yeah, you know I won't.
<b></b>
Okay.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.003
I've been taking
this antidote that Liz made.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.380
No... (stammers)
She doesn't know.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.007
But it's rebuilding
some of my memories

16:48.048 --> 16:49.550
from before
the 1947 crash, right?

16:49.591 --> 16:51.552
I was just a little kid,
but I had a destiny.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.845
I had responsibilities.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.847
Right, you're the, the savior.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.432
Yes-- well, maybe.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.768
But I-I was starting
to remember these symbols

16:59.810 --> 17:01.895
from our old language, right?

17:01.937 --> 17:04.982
(stammers)
I remember what they mean,
but, uh, but...

17:05.024 --> 17:06.984
it's like the meaning
is just out of reach.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.946
And I'm...
I'm out of the antidote.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.657
And, you know,
Liz is getting suspicious.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.409
So...
Hmm.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.286
No.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.704
Oh, I-I didn't say anything.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.705
Really?

17:19.747 --> 17:21.290
Can you tell that to your face?

17:21.331 --> 17:23.584
I'm not using my friendship
with your girlfriend

17:23.625 --> 17:25.627
to steal alien steroids for you.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.421
Okay, our
partnership

17:27.463 --> 17:30.007
has limits.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.718
It's done.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.470
So now what?

17:34.511 --> 17:36.680
You inject my spine
with your mind-eraser?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.975
(chuckles) We only used
the butyricol on Jenna Cameron,

17:40.017 --> 17:41.977
because there was
still work to be done.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.730
And Flint was afraid
she'd ruin it for us.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.981
You told Flint
Charlie was creating

17:46.023 --> 17:47.441
a toxin that would kill aliens.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.109
But if you wanted
aliens dead,

17:49.151 --> 17:50.360
you'd be testing it
on me right now.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.528
'Cause that's
what I would do

17:51.570 --> 17:52.780
if I was a criminal mastermind.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.907
I needed Flint

17:54.948 --> 17:57.701
for the schematics
and the muscle.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.080
Our agendas didn't need
to align perfectly.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.998
You don't have to do this.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.374
If you kill anyone tonight,
Liz and Rosa

18:04.416 --> 18:05.793
will never look at you the same.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.252
That ship has sailed.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.047
Besides, I'm not killing anyone.

18:10.089 --> 18:14.802
If disaster never strikes,
justice won't be served.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.681
Do you want to see Alex or not?

18:19.723 --> 18:22.142
(indistinct chatter)

18:25.062 --> 18:27.231
(calliope music playing)

18:27.272 --> 18:28.732
LIZ (groans):
The kitchen is swamped.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.317
The UFO nerds are rioting.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.153
Papi, seriously...

18:33.195 --> 18:36.448
okay, we need
you at the cafÃ©.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.950
Are you kidding?

18:37.991 --> 18:39.118
Look at this line.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.452
I can't close down.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.830
Here, have a churro.

18:42.871 --> 18:43.872
Papi, please.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.207
I have a bad vibe,

18:45.249 --> 18:47.292
all right, a gut feeling
I can't shake.

18:47.334 --> 18:51.004
Who are you? Elizabeth
Ortecho doesn't do feelings.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.214
She believes
in facts

18:52.256 --> 18:53.549
and evidence.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.217
No, I do feelings now--
I've evolved.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.593
Here, Diego.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.470
Have a churro.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.514
Please.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.266
Papi, do this for me.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.227
(sighs)

19:05.269 --> 19:06.728
Okay.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.855
Okay, all right, Papi.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.860
(humming)

19:12.901 --> 19:14.862
(door opens)

19:14.903 --> 19:16.280
Guerin?

19:16.321 --> 19:18.866
You're okay.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.118
Yeah.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.496
Guerin, you were right--
they used me to get to you.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.206
My dad hit me
over the head,

19:26.248 --> 19:27.833
and then he swiped
a piece of the console.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.793
And then Flint showed up
with a gun to my head.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.461
Did anyone hurt you?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.463
Nothing I can't handle.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.299
Helena's been
weirdly motherly.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.050
She's-she's bringing me
clothes and meals...

19:37.092 --> 19:38.594
Your leg.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.179
Yeah, they took the prosthetic.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.972
I tried to bludgeon
my brother with it.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.390
(laughs)

19:43.432 --> 19:44.975
Come on, use your powers.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.352
Get me out of this.
<b></b>
Helena dosed me with something.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.730
I'm basically human
till it wears off.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.608
Okay, then find something

19:52.649 --> 19:54.401
that'll break the cuff
or my wrist-- I don't care!

19:54.443 --> 19:55.402
Alex,

19:55.444 --> 19:56.945
tonight at CrashCon,

19:56.987 --> 19:58.280
your dad plans
to release a toxin

19:58.322 --> 20:00.699
that kills anyone
with alien DNA.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.751
(clattering nearby)

20:24.389 --> 20:25.349
Hola.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.142
Amparo, seÃ±or.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.353
It's the second Saturday.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.687
Deep cleaning day.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.897
All right, well, this time do

20:31.939 --> 20:33.315
a better job dusting the top

20:33.357 --> 20:35.192
of the kitchen cupboards.
Â¿Comprendo?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.861
(chuckles)

20:43.116 --> 20:46.161
Helena made Charlie and I
build an identical device,

20:46.203 --> 20:49.039
but one that... targets
a different DNA.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.667
She somehow got her hands
on your dad's cells.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.923
She knows your dad
killed Kyle's dad.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.634
She wants revenge, but she wants
him to take himself out.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.136
(water running)

21:05.430 --> 21:08.684
When he pulls the trigger
on us tonight,

21:08.725 --> 21:11.728
your dad's gonna die
because of a device I built.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.357
ALEX:
No. That is not on you. Okay?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.359
Now let me out of here.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.068
MICHAEL:
I can't.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.071
The atomizer will kill anyone
in your dad's direct line.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.073
You are safer here.
<b></b>
Are you serious?

21:24.074 --> 21:25.409
And I got to go.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.039
I'm gonna come back for you.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.255
These letters
are beautiful.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.840
Didn't really know
she was capable

21:39.881 --> 21:42.134
of love like this.
<b></b>
Can I keep
some of these?

21:42.175 --> 21:43.969
For blackmail purposes.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.931
Max Evans, surrounded
by beautiful women.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.892
I told you in middle school,
man, it gets better.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.811
Are you okay?
<b></b>
I'm fine.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.937
And you are
beautiful.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.439
You're
such an idiot!

21:55.480 --> 21:57.316
You don't comply with
a kidnapper's ransom demands.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.234
Without telling me.
<b></b>
Alex was in trouble.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.278
He had to go.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.905
Mikey, where are
Alex and Charlie?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.365
They're safe.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.200
Your mom doesn't want
to hurt them.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.869
Look, I don't get it.
Does she want to kill aliens?

22:08.910 --> 22:09.411
Mm-mm, no.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.955
She's avenging
her murdered lover.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.206
ISOBEL:
Oh, my God,

22:13.248 --> 22:16.251
I love a good telenovela.

22:16.293 --> 22:20.464
This atomizer contains
the poison that kills anyone

22:20.505 --> 22:22.632
with alien DNA.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.676
I need you to destroy it.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.636
Does Flint know
that you have it?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.805
Flint. Jesse
really broke that boy.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.808
Some people were never
meant to be parents.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.268
You can go when
you're done.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.478
The door's unlocked.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.855
Flint's rifle
shoots blanks.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.107
W-Well, what's to stop me
from leaving now?

22:39.149 --> 22:42.903
The knowledge that
that deadly device

22:42.944 --> 22:44.696
only exists
because of you.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.282
You decide.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.492
I'm off to CrashCon.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.994
I hear there will be
quite a show.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.464
COOK:
Here you go.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.508
âª You say what you say... âª

23:04.549 --> 23:05.717
You have to eat.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.177
I need you to be
all filled up

23:07.219 --> 23:07.886
to support the meltdown
I'm gonna have

23:07.928 --> 23:10.680
once I process everything
we've learned today. Yeah?

23:10.722 --> 23:13.642
âª You play all the right games âª

23:13.683 --> 23:17.771
âª You always try to be
everything to everyone... âª

23:17.813 --> 23:19.523
I want to help.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.902
Your mom's not the villain here.
All right?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.821
She-She's going about this
all wrong, yes.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.156
But Manes is already
a murderer.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.699
I mean, if he'd succeeded
today...

23:29.741 --> 23:31.034
I know, I know...

23:31.076 --> 23:32.327
I could have lost
almost everyone

23:32.369 --> 23:33.078
I care about
in a moment.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.706
I remember every day what it was
like to lose you and Rosa.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.333
I don't think I could
survive that again.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.293
And she could've built

23:40.335 --> 23:42.712
a decoy bomb that
wouldn't have hurt anyone.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.840
He'd just get angry
and do it again.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.299
Yeah, but he's not the only one
that this would hurt.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.386
I mean, the headlines
if she gets caught?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.430
"Illegal Mexican immigrant

23:51.471 --> 23:55.267
slaughters decorated American
vet via bioweapon."

23:55.308 --> 23:59.354
People will line up to lay
bricks at the border wall.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.106
But, hey, maybe the president
will talk about my family

24:01.148 --> 24:02.649
at his rallies.
That's gonna be fun.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.942
That's not gonna happen.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.277
Right?
This will get covered up,

24:05.318 --> 24:07.154
like every other strange death
in this town.

24:07.195 --> 24:07.821
In case you
haven't noticed,

24:07.863 --> 24:10.782
those cover-ups don't tend
to protect the Mexicans.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.493
Even when...

24:13.535 --> 24:16.246
Even when Rosa died.
You can say it, Liz.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.165
It's okay, it's fair.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.041
Rosa got blamed,
white people didn't.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.127
Okay? I get it.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.922
I know you're on my side,
but you don't get this.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.216
And that's not your fault,
that's just the reality

24:28.258 --> 24:30.135
of our experiences.

24:30.177 --> 24:34.473
If I mess up... if I so much
as roll through a stop sign,

24:34.514 --> 24:38.518
any
Mexican who came before me.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.062
And it hurts any Mexican
who comes after me.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.400
I used to think that nothing
would ever change that,

24:45.442 --> 24:48.236
but lately I think...

24:48.278 --> 24:51.948
maybe if something extraordinary
happened, it could.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.243
Extraordinary? Like
what you're doing in your lab?

24:55.285 --> 24:58.872
I've discovered something
that could be the key

24:58.914 --> 25:01.708
to curing people who
have no hope otherwise.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.959
I can't walk away.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.878
So you're gonna turn
my family's stem cells

25:04.920 --> 25:06.254
into the hottest commodity?
<b></b>
No.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.673
I, I won't, I-- we'll find
a way to synthesize it

25:08.715 --> 25:09.299
or replicate it.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.593
Is this about the people
you're trying to save

25:11.635 --> 25:12.677
or about becoming
the poster girl

25:12.719 --> 25:13.303
for immigrants everywhere?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.514
You want the president
to talk about your family

25:15.555 --> 25:17.766
because of you.
Because you saved the world.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.100
If those in power
see what happens

25:19.142 --> 25:21.061
when people are
given opportunity...

25:21.102 --> 25:22.521
You want the glory.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.651
I want recognition.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.779
I want to be the
example I never had.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.364
And people
who want glory,

25:32.405 --> 25:34.241
they-th-they're just in it
for selfish reasons.

25:34.282 --> 25:37.118
People like Jesse Manes
want the glory.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.996
He, he wants to be
a-a big American hero.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.541
He wa-- he wants the parades,
he wants the medals.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.091
I-I-If he sets off
his alien atomizer at CrashCon,

25:51.132 --> 25:52.467
a handful of
twentysomethings will die

25:52.509 --> 25:54.344
of some m-mysterious ailment

25:54.386 --> 25:55.845
and it's barely
gonna make the news.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.515
That's not what
he wants.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.934
We're missing part
of his plan.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.769
First,
something violent.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.188
Large-scale,
that'll draw media attention.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.982
And then, once all eyes
are on Roswell...

26:07.023 --> 26:09.276
He'll blame the violence
on the aliens.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.988
He only gets his parade
if he makes people afraid,

26:13.029 --> 26:15.448
and then he destroys
the thing that they fear.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.909
If he makes people think
that you're terrorists

26:17.951 --> 26:19.869
before he kills you.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.548
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:31.590 --> 26:33.383
terrestrial and otherwise,

26:33.425 --> 26:35.468
the man of the hour...

26:35.510 --> 26:37.095
Graham Green!
<b></b>
(cheering)

26:37.137 --> 26:39.514
Oh, look. It's the little green
CrashCon man.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.934
Hey, you guys shouldn't be here.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.060
I was held
hostage, Max.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.604
I deserve
to ride the Sizzler

26:45.645 --> 26:47.314
until I barf cotton candy,
and maybe

26:47.355 --> 26:49.232
watch a bad man die.
<b></b>
LIZ:
You guys, we think that...

26:49.274 --> 26:53.028
GRAHAM:
Hello, loyal fans
and devoted supporters!

26:53.069 --> 26:55.947
Your patience is about
to be rewarded.

26:55.989 --> 27:00.452
Today, I am thrilled--
nay, honored--

27:00.493 --> 27:03.997
to show you the result of
years of painstaking work,

27:04.039 --> 27:06.416
the moment we've all
been waiting for.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.253
Irrefutable
extraterrestrial proof!

27:10.295 --> 27:13.715
A bona fide
alien artifact!

27:13.757 --> 27:16.009
(crowd gasps)

27:16.051 --> 27:18.094
(crowd murmuring)

27:27.604 --> 27:29.939
FLINT:
Chow time.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.859
Come on, you've been
through worse.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.486
You'll be
out of here tomorrow.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.446
If you're doing this
to try to impress Dad,

27:36.488 --> 27:39.366
it is never gonna work.
<b></b>
I'm not trying
to impress Dad.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.494
His shutdown of Project Shepherd
was an infirm decision,

27:42.535 --> 27:46.039
but he's trained me
my entire life to take it on.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.666
See you later, brother.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.085
Going to CrashCon.
Rocket launch.

27:50.126 --> 27:50.960
Hey, wait.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.462
Wait.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.839
Do you remember when Mom
used to drive us to the res,

27:54.881 --> 27:56.925
and, and you would sit
at the loom with Granddad?

27:56.966 --> 27:58.510
Weaving stories.

27:58.551 --> 28:02.806
When was the last time
you made something, Flint?

28:02.847 --> 28:05.642
Anything that wasn't built
to destroy?

28:05.684 --> 28:08.895
Around the time that
Mom decided that to leave Dad,

28:08.937 --> 28:10.271
she had to leave us.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.690
She didn't know what
he would do to us.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.274
us.

28:13.316 --> 28:14.818
Me and Clay are fine.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.319
Hell, even Gregory's coming
to see Dad today.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.612
Wait, what?

28:17.654 --> 28:19.239
Gregory's at CrashCon?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.658
Later.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.326
You're wrong.

28:23.368 --> 28:27.205
Dad's victims.
Sure, he beat me up,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.290
but what he put the rest of
you through was abuse, too.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.167
He made you watch
while he kicked my ass.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.712
Shut up, Alex!
<b></b>
He scared you into thinking

28:33.753 --> 28:37.173
that there was only one type
of man that you could become.
<b></b>
You're so pathetic.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.676
You don't know me at all!
This has nothing to do with Dad

28:39.718 --> 28:41.511
and everything to do
with our history.

28:41.553 --> 28:45.557
Aliens are a foreign threat.
They're invaders.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.726
(grunting)

28:54.524 --> 28:56.901
(laughter
and indistinct chatter)

28:56.943 --> 28:58.903
Alex's piece must have been
the last one that Manes needed

28:58.945 --> 29:00.113
to finish
building it.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.366
Where's he been keeping
the rest of this?

29:03.408 --> 29:06.911
You can get a closer look
at Graham Green's UFO Emporium.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.621
For a nominal fee.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.041
Kid.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.002
Kid, I-I seen that thing before.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.504
Your mother built that
back in the old barn.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.632
I don't know what it is, but
it is definitely explosive.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.967
I always wondered
what happened

29:21.009 --> 29:24.053
to the pieces.
<b></b>
Maybe Harlan

29:24.095 --> 29:27.140
or Tripp Manes gathered
'em up, rebuilt it.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.267
Yeah, but if Manes is gonna
use that to blow up CrashCon,

29:29.309 --> 29:31.394
it's gonna make Graham Green
look like the bad guy.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.188
No one's gonna think
an alien planted it.

29:33.229 --> 29:33.772
Unless they follow
the money.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.399
I got an alert from
my bank this morning.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.026
A $10,000 deposit had cleared.

29:38.067 --> 29:39.527
You think
Manes set it up

29:39.569 --> 29:40.195
so that the investigation
would lead to you?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.822
If I become the world's
first alien terrorist

29:42.864 --> 29:44.032
and he takes me out,

29:44.073 --> 29:45.116
the world cheers.

29:45.158 --> 29:45.825
Guys, you need to do
whatever you can

29:45.867 --> 29:48.453
to get as many people out
of here as possible, okay?

29:48.495 --> 29:50.622
Get help.
<b></b>
Hey, where are you going?

29:50.663 --> 29:52.248
Michael and I have studied
this material before.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.083
It-It-It's part tech,
but it's also part organic.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.753
And if it's part organic,
that means it can be killed.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.338
I got to get back to my lab.

29:58.379 --> 29:59.422
Uh, Liz.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.805
Take my car.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.355
Hey, not so fast.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.106
Selfies with the artifact
will be available

30:17.148 --> 30:19.776
exclusively at my UFO Emporium.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.819
Oh, I just wanted a final look.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.445
I mean, I did donate it,
didn't I?

30:22.487 --> 30:23.863
You sold it.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.698
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.952
See, well, I'm a collector.
So, you know, I have a, uh,

30:28.993 --> 30:31.538
a fossilized Martian placenta
that you would love.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.873
Uh, that's yours
for the right price.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.793
We'll be in touch.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.464
(phone camera clicking)

30:44.551 --> 30:46.761
Do you think we can destroy it?

30:46.803 --> 30:49.138
MICHAEL:
No.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.890
The pieces want
to be together,

30:50.932 --> 30:52.016
and now
that it's complete,

30:52.058 --> 30:54.394
if we break the bonds
with brute force,

30:54.435 --> 30:56.604
we risk
a violent reaction.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.064

31:02.110 --> 31:03.778

what are you doing?

just happened to you?

31:17.417 --> 31:18.877
Huh? Nothing.
(chuckles)

31:18.918 --> 31:20.128
I think this is a remote.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.630

controls a ship.

I mean, what dumbass varnishes

31:30.096 --> 31:31.973
the top of the stage?

31:32.015 --> 31:35.059
Wait, if this...
if this is fresh varnish,

31:35.101 --> 31:37.437
this whole platform is
set up like a tinderbox.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.439
There's gonna be fireworks
tonight.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.774
One spark'll light a fire.
I mean, this whole thing,

31:41.816 --> 31:43.484
the whole platform
will go up.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.652
This giant remote goes kaboom,

31:44.694 --> 31:45.904
aliens will be framed
as terrorists.

You have to get out of here.

What? No, I'm not
going anywhere.
Max, you are

31:49.657 --> 31:51.117
all sorts of worked up

32:39.332 --> 32:40.166
You need to leave

Well, she said

but I don't see any water.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.015

33:16.995 --> 33:19.622
They're my students.
Figured I'd...

treat this little hometown visit
like a field trip.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.835
Ah.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.537
âª We are yours âª

40:56.579 --> 41:00.541
âª We're waiting for you... âª

41:00.583 --> 41:02.293
Maria.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.752
Maria, are you all right?

41:03.794 --> 41:06.380
âª Are yours âª

41:06.422 --> 41:08.382
âª We're waiting... âª

41:08.424 --> 41:10.509
Hey. Hey.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.720
Greg, you've got to get out
of here-- it's too dangerous.

41:12.761 --> 41:14.472
I know a weapon when I see one.

41:14.513 --> 41:15.681
What are you
about to do?

41:15.723 --> 41:18.142
Alex, I begged you
to stay away!

41:18.184 --> 41:21.187
ALEX:
No, Guerin, stop!

41:21.228 --> 41:22.730
You don't know
what he is, son.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.732
I know what he means to Alex.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.485
(fireworks popping)

41:27.526 --> 41:29.236
(Liz panting)

41:29.278 --> 41:31.363
Liz, what happened?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.532
My God, is that
Flint Manes?
Yes.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.950
Let me take over.
There's a fire by the stage.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.203
Graham Green's alien thing
is gonna explode.

41:37.244 --> 41:38.787
Take my bag. There's
a chemical agent.

41:38.829 --> 41:39.538
Solution A is a catalyst...

41:39.538 --> 41:42.166
No, I don't know
enough chemistry
to make a cupcake, Liz.

41:42.208 --> 41:42.875
God, you are the only one

41:42.875 --> 41:45.961
who can save an entire carnival
of people from a bomb.

41:46.003 --> 41:48.255
I can't lose him again.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.841
