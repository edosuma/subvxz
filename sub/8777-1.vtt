things are they teaching young
girls in college these days?

08:10.867 --> 08:13.133
JANE: Oh, just a lot
of useless stuff.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.733
Well, that's good.

08:14.767 --> 08:17.767
This way I feel like I'm
not wasting my money.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.300
The practical things
you ought to be able
to learn on your own.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.100

goes to college.

08:27.567 --> 08:30.733
Why it sure has a
nice ring about it.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.567
- It's good to be home.
- Mmm.

08:33.633 --> 08:34.866
How's the gang?

08:34.900 --> 08:36.732
Oh, same as ever.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.033

Matt, well, uh...

08:42.967 --> 08:44.833
What?

08:44.867 --> 08:46.167
Matt left.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.167
- He left? Why?
- Mmm.

08:48.267 --> 08:53.500
I don't know. He told me his
dad was ill and he wanted
to go home and help out.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.733
But for some reason when
he told me, it didn't seem
to ring true with me.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.633
I just didn't feel it
was my place to ask
him the real reasons.

09:00.667 --> 09:04.167
- I always thought he was
happy working for us.
- Hmm.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.500
Well, sometimes people change.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.367

quite how.

- Why don't you mind your
own business, bitch?
- What did you say?

- MAGREW: No, no, no.
- You want some
of this too, Grandpa?

11:02.800 --> 11:04.467
- Grandpa?
- Yeah.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.767
As a matter of fact, I do.
Come on, give me a little
something of that, tough guy.

Now, you get in your car!
You and your friends,
get in your car

11:22.133 --> 11:23.333

up off the ground!

making flippant remarks to my

No, sir. I won't have it!

11:33.533 --> 11:34.867
Now, go ahead,
get out of here!

11:34.900 --> 11:37.267
You're gonna do something
about it, old man? Huh?

11:37.267 --> 11:39.267

about it. Come on, I sure do.

- Never mind that!

volume down here!

busy, Tank! Come on!

12:10.700 --> 12:11.767
Yes, sir.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.467
Did you do this?

12:18.500 --> 12:21.700
- Yes, ma'am.
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry.
- Well, why are you sorry?

12:22.933 --> 12:24.433
You do this by yourself?

12:25.367 --> 12:26.700
Yes, ma'am.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.933
It's good.

12:30.267 --> 12:33.100

angel half animal.

But you wonder about
some folks if they have
any angel in them at all.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.167
Don't get yourself in a
state about it. I mean,

12:39.267 --> 12:41.300
kids use worse language
at college all the time.

12:41.333 --> 12:45.500

lot better. (LAUGHING)

do the windows.

12:58.467 --> 12:59.800

take you to do this?

13:33.567 --> 13:36.167

Ain't finished yet.

13:36.267 --> 13:38.267

Yes, sir.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.333
What's your name, boy?

13:44.100 --> 13:45.367
Folks call me Tank.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.867
No, no. I don't wanna
know what folks call you.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.933
What's your name?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.967
Robert. Robert Winsley.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.033
Well, Robert Winsley,

13:56.067 --> 13:59.067
this is my daughter, Jane.
She's fresh back from college.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.900
Ma'am, uh, miss.

14:01.933 --> 14:03.667
Hey, Robert.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.633
I'm Dr. Magrew.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.533
I'm not a real doctor,
it's an honorary title.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.900
Sir.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.267
How much they pay you
around here, Robert?

14:12.267 --> 14:15.733
Pay me? Uh, $30 a week.

14:17.133 --> 14:20.833
I run the marvel show out on
Route 23. You know about it?

14:22.267 --> 14:24.100
Uh, no, sir.

14:24.133 --> 14:27.567
Ha. I guess that's my fault.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.700
I don't have much of
a way with publicity.

14:29.733 --> 14:33.100
But I could pay you $35
a week, if you wanna
come out and work for me.

14:34.633 --> 14:35.667
Doing what sort of work?

14:39.167 --> 14:41.000
This sort of work, Robert.

14:41.733 --> 14:42.733
What do you say?

14:44.267 --> 14:46.833
*

15:05.667 --> 15:07.300
MAGREW: Robert?

15:07.333 --> 15:09.167
Welcome to The
House of Marvels.

15:10.500 --> 15:14.133
That's Little Sparky, the
world's first electric chair.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.767
Over there we have
Hotep, King of the Nile.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.533
And that's Mogo,
the Beast Man.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.633
I picked him up at
the traveling show.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.100
Is that for real?

15:23.133 --> 15:26.033
For real as man's
capacity to dream.

15:26.067 --> 15:28.933
It's an old gorilla skin
stretched over a wood frame.

15:28.967 --> 15:31.867
- Thank you, my dear.
- Wait'll you see the
rest of the guys.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.733
- The guys?
- Yeah, they're through
here, come on.

15:37.933 --> 15:39.400
Where are they?

15:39.433 --> 15:41.933
Well, I was trying to tell
you, with Matt gone that
I'd just decided...

15:41.967 --> 15:45.267
Oh! I hate it when you
lock them up. It's not fair.

15:45.300 --> 15:49.133
- Honey, you know I do it
for their own protection.
- I know.

15:49.167 --> 15:52.933
Come on. They're down in the
workshop. I'll introduce you.
Locked up by this cruel man.

15:52.967 --> 15:58.367
- You have something locked up?
- No, no, no. But go on, be
prepared for a big surprise.

16:05.900 --> 16:11.067
Hi, Pinhead.
Oh, did you miss me?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.300
Here, let me introduce
you to Robert.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.967
Is that for real?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.833
Yeah, we call this
fellow Pinhead.

16:17.867 --> 16:21.700
I mean upstairs it's all
just bunkin', but these
are the real marvels.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.033
See that mean lookin' fellow
there, we call him Blade.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.533
- Don't shake his hand.
- (GRUMBLING)

16:25.567 --> 16:27.867
- Fellow next to him is
called Six-Shooter.
-(GROANING)

16:27.900 --> 16:29.167
- And that's Jester.
- (MOANS)

16:29.267 --> 16:31.767
- And that lovely lady
is Leech Woman.
-(SIGHS)

16:31.800 --> 16:35.833
- Why "Leech Woman"?
- Well, hope that you never
find out. (CHUCKLES)

16:35.867 --> 16:39.367
And this is Tunneler, aptly
named. (SNICKERS)

16:40.533 --> 16:42.267
There are no strings.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.000
That's right, Robert.

16:44.033 --> 16:45.833
Not on these puppets.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.467
So, how do you like your room?

16:49.500 --> 16:53.633
- Hmm? Oh, it's, uh...
It's fine. Thank you, sir.
- Good.

16:53.667 --> 16:56.500
- Here you go.
- Thank you, miss.

16:56.533 --> 17:00.033
You know you're gonna
have to start calling
me Jane sometime soon.

17:01.967 --> 17:05.333
MAGREW:
For these blessings that
we are about to receive,

17:06.500 --> 17:08.800
- Lord, truly make us thankful.
- Hmm?

17:10.067 --> 17:11.133
Amen.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.833
So, (CLEARING THROAT)

17:14.867 --> 17:17.700
do they eat?

17:18.633 --> 17:21.099
No, son. (CHUCKLES)

17:23.900 --> 17:26.532
I don't understand.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.867
I just don't understand
how puppets can live.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.933
You know, Robert,
I don't understand
how anything be alive.

17:32.967 --> 17:36.433
A man, a tree, a fish, but,

17:36.467 --> 17:41.567
you know, I guess when the
miracle is commonplace enough,
people just don't question it.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.267
But, how do you make them?

17:44.267 --> 17:47.567
Well, I have a confession
to make. I didn't make them,

17:47.600 --> 17:50.733
- I bought them at an
auction years ago.
-(GROANING)

17:50.767 --> 17:53.300
They came in an old trunk
and when I took them, well,

17:53.333 --> 17:55.667
-they were the same
then as they are now.
-(SNICKERING)

17:55.700 --> 17:58.000
See, I've tried to
duplicate that process,

17:58.033 --> 18:00.600
but I've never been able
to make a living puppet.

18:00.633 --> 18:03.900
I've come close. Heaven
knows I've come close.
(CHUCKLING)

18:06.400 --> 18:08.700
I can't say I like the way
they're staring at me.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.900
Oh, don't be fooled by
the way they look.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.533
They're really gentle.

18:13.567 --> 18:17.833
You know, Robert, when
I hired you, I needed
help with the show.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.400
But I did have another
reason in mind.

18:21.867 --> 18:22.933
This.

18:24.900 --> 18:28.400
You see, I wanna
carve a living puppet
just like these.

18:29.267 --> 18:31.900
And you have a special skill.

18:31.933 --> 18:34.600
And I need you to
carve me a miracle.

18:34.633 --> 18:36.000
Will you help me?

18:41.700 --> 18:44.467
Yes, sir, I will. I'll help.

19:14.967 --> 19:18.467
Clear away now. Clear away!

19:19.833 --> 19:21.567
Hey, there.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.500
Aren't you that big old boy
that works at the gas station?

19:25.533 --> 19:30.500
Uh, yes, sir, I was.
I started working here.

19:30.533 --> 19:32.767
How'd you get mixed up
with this old coot?

19:33.167 --> 19:34.300
I'm sorry?

19:34.333 --> 19:36.633
Heh. Skip it, skip it.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.167
Where's Magrew?

19:38.267 --> 19:42.133
Um, I'm not sure,
I think he may be in...

19:42.167 --> 19:45.100
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.

19:45.133 --> 19:48.633
We're not gonna get any
answers out of this dummy.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.467
(CLAPPING)

19:53.500 --> 19:55.833
Solid oak, guys, solid oak.
Pass it around.

20:08.967 --> 20:11.833
Fastest six guns in the West,
Six-Shooter.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.667
Give him a hand,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.933
He's only a puppet,
but he loves applause.

20:15.967 --> 20:17.167
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

20:23.033 --> 20:24.800
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.700
One of the many marvels
of The House of Marvels.
Take a look at them.

20:29.133 --> 20:32.633
- Ooh!
- Wow!

20:35.333 --> 20:38.267
Take a look at them.
One of the many marvels
at The House of Marvels.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.000
Go ahead, step right up.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.800
Take a closer look
if you want.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.167
Sheriff.

20:54.267 --> 20:56.167
Someplace quiet.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.267
You wanna take care of
things for a while?

21:02.267 --> 21:04.600
Why? What's wrong?

21:04.633 --> 21:08.133
Oh, nothing wrong, darling.
We ain't here
to arrest nobody.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.600
Oh, my.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.700
What a nasty looking booger.

21:11.733 --> 21:14.800
Well, I guess folks will pay
to see just about anything.

21:16.567 --> 21:17.567
(GUM SQUISHING)

21:34.567 --> 21:35.733
(FAINT GROWLING)

21:35.767 --> 21:39.100
SHERIFF: So who all you got
living in this place?

21:39.133 --> 21:43.333
Um, myself,

21:43.367 --> 21:47.733
my daughter and the young boy
selling tickets in the booth.

21:47.767 --> 21:49.267
He lives here?

21:49.300 --> 21:51.300
Yeah, that's right.
That's my new assistant.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.933
What about the other boy?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.033
What other boy?

21:55.067 --> 21:58.133
What other boy do you think
I'm talking about?

21:59.367 --> 22:01.000
Oh, Matt Dairy.

22:01.033 --> 22:04.567
There you go. Looks like
you do all the time.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.167
What about him?

22:06.267 --> 22:08.267
Well, he left about
two weeks ago.

22:08.267 --> 22:11.500
He told me his dad was sick
and that he was
going home to help out.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.967
Do tell, do tell.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.367
Well, it's funny,

22:15.400 --> 22:17.433
on account of him
not having a pa,

22:17.467 --> 22:18.967
and his ma,
she's a bit worried.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.267
Him not showing up or
calling or nothing.

22:21.667 --> 22:22.700
Yeah, I know.

22:22.733 --> 22:24.267
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

22:24.267 --> 22:27.633
Oh, I guess that's because
Mrs. Dairy gave you a call
a couple of days ago.

22:27.667 --> 22:31.267
Well, after she called you,
she gave me a call.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.400
Yeah, that's right, I spoke
with her.

22:33.433 --> 22:35.033
I told her what
I just told you.

22:36.767 --> 22:39.000
It's obvious that Matt
must have lied to me
for some reason.

22:39.033 --> 22:40.633
What reason would that be?

22:41.600 --> 22:42.767
Honestly, Sheriff,
I don't know.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.167
Honestly?

22:45.267 --> 22:47.767
Well, heaven knows
we all like a little honesty.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.333
Look, Sheriff, if you're
implying that I had
anything to do with...

22:50.367 --> 22:53.000
I'm not implying
one sweet little thing.

22:53.033 --> 22:54.667
Just since your
former assistant seemed to

22:54.700 --> 22:57.067
drop clean off
the face of the world,

22:57.100 --> 22:59.900
and you being the
last living soul to see
him before the plunge,

22:59.933 --> 23:02.333
I just felt it was my duty
to come and talk to you.

23:03.900 --> 23:07.467
He told me he was leaving
because his dad was sick.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.767
He packed his bags and he
went off to the bus station.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.767
- On foot?
- That's right.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.833
Didn't drive him?

23:13.867 --> 23:16.500
How could I, Sheriff,
if he was on foot?

23:16.533 --> 23:18.367
You trying to be funny,
Magrew?

23:18.400 --> 23:20.267
Hardly.

23:20.267 --> 23:24.033
I got a disappeared boy,
that's serious business.

23:24.067 --> 23:26.067
Look, I'm not trying
to make light of it.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.100
I'm sorry,
I just can't help you.

23:29.133 --> 23:31.300
I don't know what
could have happened.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.533
I see.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.967
Bobby, take out your pad.

23:38.067 --> 23:41.333
Write this down.

23:41.367 --> 23:44.867
Mr. Magrew don't know what
could have happened to
poor little Matt Dairy.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.700
Well, since you're so sure,

23:47.733 --> 23:49.967
I guess that pretty much
settles our business
here for now.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.167
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.500
Well, that makes three of us.

23:55.533 --> 23:57.000
But don't you worry,

23:57.033 --> 23:59.967
before you're done, you may
end up being real helpful.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.600
I gotta think on it a bit.

24:02.633 --> 24:07.167
Tell you though, if I come up
with something, I'll be sure
to stroll on back.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.933
Anytime.

24:10.967 --> 24:13.900
Okay, it's a deal.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.967
It's just terrible,
what happened to Matt.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.267
It's so scary to think you
could just vanish,

24:39.267 --> 24:41.400
and no one will ever know
what happened to you.

24:41.433 --> 24:46.267
-(GRUNTING)
- Oh, I'm sorry.
No, no, don't be upset.

24:46.267 --> 24:49.033
You know, I'm sure he's fine.

24:49.067 --> 24:52.267
I mean, he didn't have
any money, did he?

24:52.267 --> 24:55.633
Well, what reason would anyone
have for hurting him?

24:55.667 --> 24:57.367
MAGREW:
Here are the raw materials.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.867
Hard, fine grain.

24:59.833 --> 25:03.333
No knots, no flaws,
perfect wood.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.367
I've never seen wood like it.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.000
What is it?

25:08.033 --> 25:11.100
Very exotic. Very expensive.

25:11.133 --> 25:15.267
And here, here are
the tools you'll need.

25:15.267 --> 25:18.767
Study them.
Learn what each one can do.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.833
444 pieces.

25:26.867 --> 25:30.567
Each piece must be
cut precisely to scale.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.633
Like the inner gears
of a wooden clock,

25:32.667 --> 25:35.133
there can be no flaws,
no mistakes,

25:35.167 --> 25:37.400
in size, dimension or shape.

25:37.433 --> 25:41.300
Otherwise, the puppet cannot
be properly assembled.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.900
All this would be wasted.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.967
What will it look like
when it's finished?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.500
You'll learn that
in good time, son.

25:49.533 --> 25:53.633
I don't understand,
I mean what's the secret?

25:53.667 --> 25:55.367
These are just pieces of wood.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.667
No matter how
perfect I carve them,

25:57.700 --> 26:00.800
they'll still just be
pieces of wood.

26:00.833 --> 26:05.167
How can putting them
together make them live?

26:05.267 --> 26:08.267
You want to know the secret of
how to make a dead thing live?

26:09.367 --> 26:12.267
You put your soul into it.

26:13.733 --> 26:16.433
You put everything you have
into this carving,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.067
and you have my word,

26:19.100 --> 26:21.500
it will live.

26:23.867 --> 26:26.033
When do you think
you can begin?

26:27.400 --> 26:28.467
Right now.

27:44.367 --> 27:46.667
Have you seen his work?

27:46.700 --> 27:51.333
Yeah, I've seen it.
I can't tell how good it is,
it's all in pieces.

27:51.367 --> 27:54.000
This boy's
a real artist, yes, sir.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.800
Better than Matt?

27:57.733 --> 27:59.533
Matt did carving for you too?

27:59.567 --> 28:01.600
Oh, yeah, he did work for us.

28:01.633 --> 28:05.267
I'd show it to you, except
that he took it with him.

28:05.300 --> 28:09.767
His work was good.
He was a natural.
But you're better.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.867
His work had quality.
But yours?

28:12.900 --> 28:14.767
Yours has perfection.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.033
After all, that's what
we're striving for, isn't it?

28:19.767 --> 28:21.133
Sir?

28:21.167 --> 28:23.100
Perfection.

28:23.133 --> 28:26.500
We're trying
to create perfection.

28:26.533 --> 28:28.733
Take a look at
Blade over there.

28:28.767 --> 28:34.000
He never tires, never hungers,
knows no fear, tells no lies.

28:34.033 --> 28:38.567
Feels no pain, has no secrets.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.967
And what is man, except
at being at war with himself?

28:42.767 --> 28:45.400
But not Blade, mmm-mmm.

28:45.433 --> 28:48.267
He has no hidden motives,
no secret self.

28:48.267 --> 28:50.867
He's purely and perfectly
what he is.

28:50.900 --> 28:54.067
In fact, I think the world
would be a better place
if we were all like him.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.967
But he doesn't talk.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.333
Which only
supports my position.

28:58.367 --> 29:00.733
Oh, let me shut myself up.

29:00.767 --> 29:03.267
All right, now go upstairs
and go to bed.

29:03.267 --> 29:05.333
- No, no, I'm fine.
- No.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.167
The house is on fire.

31:36.933 --> 31:38.300
I'm naked.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.567
I just think it's a lot.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.500
- Robert!
- (GROANS)

31:42.533 --> 31:43.767
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.367
No, no.
It's okay, it's all right.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.667
I was just trying to
get your attention.

31:48.700 --> 31:52.733
Just throw that in
the scrap pile, would you?

31:52.767 --> 31:54.500
Robert, it's not broken.

31:54.533 --> 31:57.100
Well, it's not perfect.
I can't use it.

31:57.133 --> 31:59.267
It's got blood all over it.

32:00.367 --> 32:02.267
What did you want?

32:02.267 --> 32:06.133
Well, hell, I was coming down
to tell you that you
were working too hard.

32:06.167 --> 32:09.600
I just ended up making
more work for you.
I was just being stupid.

32:09.633 --> 32:11.867
No, no, it's my fault.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.467
Come on, let me
take a look at it.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.767
- It's fine.
- Come on, just hold it steady.

32:20.833 --> 32:21.933
You have big hands.

32:21.967 --> 32:24.533
It comes with the rest of me.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.100
You don't talk much, do you?

32:27.133 --> 32:29.433
Not that much to say, I guess.

32:30.433 --> 32:31.533
Well, where are you from?

32:32.567 --> 32:33.900
Who are your folks?

32:35.333 --> 32:39.300
I come from Witherspoon.
Ain't got no folks.

32:40.767 --> 32:44.267
Come from the orphanage,
to the gas station, to here.

32:44.967 --> 32:46.867
That's about all.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.433
Ain't been no place,

32:49.467 --> 32:52.433
got no brains for school
or nothing like that.

32:52.467 --> 32:57.400
Oh, come one.
Brains are the most
overrated organ that there is.

32:57.433 --> 33:02.167
You know, college is full
of kids with brains who will
never amount to anything.

33:02.267 --> 33:06.267
They'll never be worth a damn.

33:06.267 --> 33:08.467
You know, Robert,
there's a way of being smart

33:08.500 --> 33:11.300
that doesn't have anything
to do with brains.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.567
Like you.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.300
You've got woodsman
in your hands.

33:18.767 --> 33:21.967
Don't you understand?

33:22.000 --> 33:26.767
Your hands can do things
that people with brains
only dream of.

33:31.300 --> 33:35.267
You know, you've been here
almost a month and you haven't
called me by my first name.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.333
I'm sorry.

33:38.367 --> 33:42.533
Don't be sorry, just say it.

33:44.733 --> 33:46.400
Jane.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.367
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

34:34.632 --> 34:38.967
You know, I really need
to get back to my room.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.467
I don't want to fall asleep
in here and have my daddy
walk in on us in the morning.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.333
Somehow, I don't think
he'd understand.

34:46.367 --> 34:47.800
I understand.

35:30.367 --> 35:34.300
Well, I'm going to
take advantage of a luxury.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.567
I'm going to read
the Sunday paper.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.667
I had a dream
about you last night.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.067
I was still in college,

35:52.100 --> 35:57.000
and you were my teacher,
or I was yours, I don't know,
it was kind of confusing.

35:59.933 --> 36:02.667
I liked the way you
kissed me the other day.

36:04.667 --> 36:05.967
I've, um...

36:07.367 --> 36:10.000
I've got to get back to work.

36:18.267 --> 36:19.500
Hey, Robert.

36:20.133 --> 36:21.400
Yeah?

36:21.433 --> 36:23.867
I've got to go run
an errand in Tunning.
You want to go with me?

36:27.700 --> 36:29.033
Sure, okay.

36:36.467 --> 36:40.100
JANE: You need some sunlight,
boy, you're pale as a ghost.

36:40.267 --> 36:42.467
So what do we
have to get in Tunning?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.733
Nothing.

36:44.433 --> 36:45.567
I'm sorry?

36:45.600 --> 36:47.833
Oh, nothing at all.

36:47.867 --> 36:50.500
Well, I don't have
anything to do all day.

36:50.533 --> 36:54.100
I, uh, well... I lied to you.

36:54.133 --> 36:55.833
Well, I thought that you
might need a little break,

36:55.867 --> 37:00.267
and since I knew you wouldn't
take one voluntarily,
I decided to force you.

37:00.300 --> 37:03.067
Yeah, I kind of thought
you'd like to go driving.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.267
- Do you?
- I like it.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.567
You know, I thought we could
go spend some time
there by the lake.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.000
Just hang out for a while.

37:11.100 --> 37:12.900
I'd like that too.

37:18.767 --> 37:20.800
JANE: You know, I wanted
to show you something.

37:20.833 --> 37:24.333
Well, I've never shown it
to anyone else before.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.400
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

37:27.433 --> 37:29.433
Wait a second, it's, um...

37:30.633 --> 37:33.067
Oh, down though here.

37:33.100 --> 37:36.367
You know, I used to come
here when I was a little girl,

37:36.400 --> 37:39.900
and I was playing around
one day and I found this
clearing in the woods,

37:40.833 --> 37:43.567
and it was so beautiful.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.833
It was like a scene out of
a fairy tale, or something,

37:46.867 --> 37:49.567
and I used to come here
to be by myself.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.867
Never told anyone else
about it, not even my dad.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.267
I don't know if anyone else
even knows that it's here.

37:57.933 --> 38:01.833
I want to show you.
Come on, I'll take you there.

38:01.867 --> 38:04.267
I haven't been here
since I went away to...

38:08.367 --> 38:10.267
Someone must've buried
garbage over here.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.467
Dogs dug it up.

38:14.367 --> 38:16.167
Oh, why did they
have to go and do that?

38:18.700 --> 38:20.633
Looks like they were
burning something.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.667
Just leave it alone, will you?

38:29.400 --> 38:30.700
Look at this, it's a...

38:32.500 --> 38:33.767
Jane?

38:41.733 --> 38:45.067
Well, well, well,
look what we have here.

38:45.100 --> 38:47.167
You on your way to grandma's
house, little girl?

38:47.267 --> 38:48.700
- Out of my way.
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:48.733 --> 38:50.600
Cut it out.
What's your problem, anyway?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.267
You know what?
You're my problem.

38:53.267 --> 38:55.100
And people like you!

38:55.133 --> 38:58.400
They're can't be anything
good in this world without
you destroying it.

38:58.433 --> 39:01.600
Whoa, what's this?
Where's this coming from?

39:01.633 --> 39:03.433
You know you have
a real problem, little girl,

39:03.467 --> 39:06.167
'cause I'm being
perfectly nice.

39:06.267 --> 39:08.367
I'm not raising my voice,
I'm not doing anything.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.700
And you come out
with this stuff,
like I'm some kind of a...

39:10.733 --> 39:11.733
Incredible Hulk.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.300
Like what?

39:15.333 --> 39:18.300
She said you were trying
to destroy the world,
and stuff.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.400
Jesus Christ, what
a fucking retard.

39:20.433 --> 39:22.433
Hey, hey, hey,
I said cut it out!

39:22.467 --> 39:24.533
You're being very rude.

39:24.567 --> 39:27.333
'Cause I'm, like, trying
to have a conversation here.

39:27.367 --> 39:30.267
- I don't want to have
a conversation with you.
- No?

39:30.267 --> 39:33.400
- Or anyone like you.
- Oh, what am I like?

39:33.433 --> 39:36.700
Hey, hey!
Again, you're pushing me.

39:36.733 --> 39:39.533
And what the hell's
your problem, anyway?
You like being pushed?

39:39.567 --> 39:42.367
- You like that?
- Get your hands off me!
Quit it!

39:43.467 --> 39:44.833
(SPANKING) Whoo!

39:44.867 --> 39:47.167
Ooh, you liked that,
didn't you?

39:47.200 --> 39:49.000
Maybe you need
a good spanking.

39:49.033 --> 39:51.633
You guys, please,
just leave me alone.

39:51.667 --> 39:54.567
Oh, well, being that
you asked so nice,

39:55.767 --> 39:56.767
no.

39:57.367 --> 39:59.667
Jane, you okay?

39:59.700 --> 40:01.467
Yeah, Robert, I'm fine.
Let's just go.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.433
No, no, no.
I don't remember telling you
you could go anywhere.

40:04.467 --> 40:05.967
Come on, guys.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.833
And I don't remember
saying anything to you, Tank.

40:08.867 --> 40:11.700
From how I'm looking at it,
this is none of your business.

40:11.733 --> 40:14.300
Anyone here think this
is any of Tank's business?

40:14.333 --> 40:16.467
- I don't.
- Mmm-mmm.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.533
- Nope.
- Guess it's unanimous.

40:19.567 --> 40:21.700
So, get the fuck out of here.

40:21.733 --> 40:25.533
Me and Little Red Riding Hood
are kind of on a little date.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.167
Just leave her alone.

40:29.333 --> 40:31.967
What'd you say?
I couldn't hear.
What'd you say?

40:34.167 --> 40:36.000
I said leave her alone.

40:36.033 --> 40:37.900
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

40:39.400 --> 40:41.333
Just leave.

40:41.367 --> 40:43.800
Are you gonna punch me? Huh?
Yeah? You gonna kick me?

40:43.833 --> 40:46.833
Slap me to teach
me a lesson, huh?
You big fucking dummy.

40:46.867 --> 40:48.700
Robert!

40:48.733 --> 40:53.400
Oh, what was he?
Your knight in shining armor?

40:53.433 --> 40:55.267
Beep, beep. Yeah!

40:56.467 --> 40:58.133
Hey, Tank, what do you say

40:58.167 --> 41:01.667
me and Little Red Riding Hood
give you a lesson
in adult education?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.167
This is all an act, isn't it?

41:04.267 --> 41:06.700
The more they struggle,
that means they want you
to be their man.

41:06.733 --> 41:09.267
- Show 'em who's boss.
- Fuck you!

41:09.267 --> 41:11.167
Jesus Christ, what language.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.400
Get the fuck off me.

41:21.533 --> 41:24.000
- Robert.
- Billy, get him off!

41:25.567 --> 41:26.867
Robert!

41:37.033 --> 41:38.433
Jesus, you okay?

41:39.433 --> 41:42.333
(GASPING) Yeah, I'm fine.
Come on.

42:10.100 --> 42:13.833
It's all right.
Let's go, I'll drive.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.767
You didn't do anything wrong.
Robert, if it weren't
for you...

42:20.800 --> 42:23.533
But you don't understand.

42:23.567 --> 42:29.167
When I had him up against
the car, it didn't have
anything to do with you.

42:29.267 --> 42:31.533
It didn't even really have
anything to do with him.

42:32.467 --> 42:36.533
I just lost control.

42:36.567 --> 42:40.967
It was like I was strangling
everything that ever wronged
me since I was born.

42:42.633 --> 42:46.133
- I could've killed him.
- Small loss, if you ask me.

42:46.167 --> 42:50.600
But I could've
killed somebody!
I could have.

42:52.333 --> 42:56.933
- I was that close.
- Robert, you're a decent man.

42:56.967 --> 43:00.900
I know from experience
that there aren't a lot
of guys like you out there.

43:02.867 --> 43:04.667
I hope you don't ever change.

43:06.267 --> 43:09.700
- I'm going to bed.
- Good night, dear.

43:18.267 --> 43:20.267
You wanna know
why you're unhappy, Robert?

43:21.667 --> 43:24.600
- Sir?
- You're at war with yourself.

43:24.633 --> 43:28.567
You do your best
on the outside to be
this meek, gentle boy.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.700
But you're different
on the inside.

43:32.267 --> 43:34.333
Yes, sir, I guess I am.

43:34.367 --> 43:38.500
There's another self inside.
A truer, more natural self.

43:38.533 --> 43:43.067
A creature of violence
with no fear,
with no conscience.

43:44.167 --> 43:46.367
A killer.

43:46.400 --> 43:50.400
You spend your whole life
battling the self
that lives inside.

43:50.433 --> 43:53.933
And what happened today,
though just for a moment,

43:55.267 --> 43:57.067
you lost that battle.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.600
The real you,
the true you came out.

44:02.433 --> 44:06.800
No, sir.
I won't say you're wrong,

44:06.833 --> 44:11.167
but if it is true,
all I can say is

44:11.267 --> 44:13.667
I'd rather die than have
it come out again.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.733
Hey, get the hell out of here!

45:32.767 --> 45:35.667
Keep it down, honey.
We don't want to wake
the house, do we?

45:35.700 --> 45:36.900
(GROANING)

45:37.567 --> 45:38.600
What the hell?

46:02.333 --> 46:03.933
Go, go!

46:12.267 --> 46:13.700
Robert, get her in the house.

46:14.733 --> 46:16.267
Go on, get her in there now.

46:28.933 --> 46:32.933
He tried to save me,
that's why he's dead.

46:32.967 --> 46:36.300
- Come on inside.
- No, we can't
just leave him here.

46:36.333 --> 46:39.500
- No, I'll do it.
- Robert!

46:39.533 --> 46:42.933
- We cannot just leave
him here in the dirt.
- We won't.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.167
We won't. Now come on.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.767
(GROANING)

47:02.833 --> 47:04.300
MAGREW: We have work to do.

47:38.033 --> 47:41.300
You hold on, okay.
I'll make you whole again.
Just hold on.

48:51.267 --> 48:55.367
You want it, bitch?
What are you gonna do now?

48:55.400 --> 49:00.833
You don't have your fucking
ape man and your fucking
puppets now, do you?

49:00.867 --> 49:06.300
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, you better get out
of my fucking face.

49:36.333 --> 49:39.833
(PUPPETS GROANING)

49:54.367 --> 49:56.667
That's right. Do it, bitch!

49:57.267 --> 49:59.067
I said, do it.

49:59.100 --> 50:01.633
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, yeah, you like that,
don't you?

51:31.900 --> 51:33.700
(SCREAMING)

51:43.433 --> 51:44.833
Somebody came to see you.

51:46.433 --> 51:49.133
Pinhead? Pinhead!

51:50.400 --> 51:54.067
Is he all right?
Are you really all right?

51:54.100 --> 51:58.267
Yeah, he's all right.
Actually better than before.

51:58.267 --> 52:00.533
His parts were
a bit worn, so...

52:01.967 --> 52:06.467
That was so brave of you.
You are my hero,
do you know that?

52:08.667 --> 52:11.267
- Oh, Robert, I...
- No, no.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.633
I'm just glad he's all right.

52:15.267 --> 52:18.267
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Robert, wait.

52:21.633 --> 52:23.300
I'm glad you're
not angry anymore.

52:26.267 --> 52:28.067
Robert, I was angry with you.

52:29.533 --> 52:31.000
But I had no right to be.

52:33.333 --> 52:35.933
I wanted that boy to suffer.

52:35.967 --> 52:38.567
I wanted you
to make that boy suffer.

52:40.533 --> 52:43.267
I should've just let you
finish him on the path.

52:43.267 --> 52:45.133
- Maybe I should have.
- No!

52:46.533 --> 52:50.033
You were right
and I was wrong.

52:51.133 --> 52:54.633
Any fool in this world
can be a destroyer.

52:54.667 --> 52:57.400
Only a very few
can be creators.

52:58.533 --> 53:01.800
Don't trade one for the other.

53:01.833 --> 53:04.167
And don't let me
or anyone else make you.

53:21.533 --> 53:24.633
You can stay if you want.

54:23.867 --> 54:26.167
- (KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Yeah?

54:28.100 --> 54:31.267
- Honey?
- Daddy, come on in.

54:37.833 --> 54:39.567
I just wanted to talk
to you about...

54:44.033 --> 54:47.700
- Pinhead.
- Robert did it.

54:47.733 --> 54:51.267
He put him back together.
He brought him back.

54:52.567 --> 54:55.400
- That's amazing.
- It's a miracle.

54:56.167 --> 54:58.767
His hands can do miracles.

55:01.600 --> 55:03.733
You really think
a great deal of him,
don't you, honey?

55:04.567 --> 55:05.700
Daddy,

55:07.267 --> 55:08.267
I love him.

55:09.267 --> 55:10.367
I see.

55:14.600 --> 55:17.133
You know, I'm not
a little girl anymore.

55:17.167 --> 55:20.267
No, I know, honey.

55:20.300 --> 55:23.100
I just don't want to see
you get hurt, that's all.

55:23.133 --> 55:25.933
Do you really think
that Robert would hurt me?

55:25.967 --> 55:29.267
No, I don't mean it that way.

55:29.300 --> 55:31.767
It's just that sometimes
these things don't last.

55:33.167 --> 55:36.667
You see, you can give
your heart to somebody,

55:38.033 --> 55:40.267
and then they're
just not there.

55:40.267 --> 55:42.133
Are you talking about Mom?

55:42.167 --> 55:44.267
No, I'm not talking
about your mother.

55:44.300 --> 55:47.400
Look, Daddy, I know
that anything can happen,

55:47.433 --> 55:49.600
that any of us
can be dead tomorrow.
I can't let that...

55:49.633 --> 55:51.067
I'm talking about Robert.

55:51.100 --> 55:53.833
I'm talking about
a temporary situation.

55:53.867 --> 55:57.433
I'm talking about a situation
that can't go on indefinitely.
Don't you understand?

55:57.467 --> 56:00.600
No! Daddy, I...

56:00.633 --> 56:03.067
Don't you see?
Robert is almost
through with the puppet.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.367
Well, what if he is?

56:05.400 --> 56:09.367
I mean, that doesn't change
the way that we feel
about one another.

56:09.400 --> 56:12.267
- What, are you gonna fire him?
- No, I wasn't going to do
anything like that.

56:12.267 --> 56:15.300
'Cause I want you to know
it doesn't make any difference
to me whether or not you do.

56:15.333 --> 56:17.267
With his talent
he can go anywhere.

56:19.300 --> 56:21.167
Honey, please,
you're not listening to me.

56:21.267 --> 56:23.667
Well, then tell me,
what are you trying to say?

56:23.700 --> 56:26.533
I'm trying to say...

56:26.567 --> 56:29.267
I'm trying to say
that you're young
and that he's young.

56:29.267 --> 56:31.400
And as you said,
anything can happen.

56:31.433 --> 56:33.367
I mean, if he were to leave...

56:34.267 --> 56:36.600
I'm just trying to say...

56:36.633 --> 56:38.967
I'm trying to say
I don't want you to be
too attached to him.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.633
I don't want you to get
too attached to him.
I don't want you to get hurt.

56:44.267 --> 56:45.267
Oh, please.

56:46.533 --> 56:48.333
Please understand.

56:48.367 --> 56:51.700
Everything I'm saying,
I'm saying for your own good.

56:55.633 --> 56:56.633
Good night.

57:05.833 --> 57:06.833
(WHISPERING)
Good night, honey.

57:16.833 --> 57:18.167
Hey, Robert, lunch break!

57:26.267 --> 57:27.567
Hey, you look pale as a ghost.

57:29.567 --> 57:30.567
Robert?

57:31.300 --> 57:32.300
I'm almost there.

57:33.467 --> 57:34.467
What?

57:35.433 --> 57:36.600
I'm almost there.

57:36.967 --> 57:37.967
Daddy?

57:39.267 --> 57:41.433
Daddy, come out here!

57:41.467 --> 57:44.733
Yes, hi, Dr. Carroll. No, no,
I'm fine, thank you.

57:44.767 --> 57:48.067
I was calling about Robert.
He's been a bit
tired lately.

57:48.100 --> 57:50.000
Feverish, delirious.

57:50.033 --> 57:51.267
He's quite ill.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.167
It's all right, Robert.
It's all right. Just rest.

57:57.133 --> 57:58.333
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

57:59.467 --> 58:01.167
What did the doctor say?

58:01.267 --> 58:03.100
He's coming over.

58:03.133 --> 58:06.600
That would be great,
Dr. Carroll, thank you. I
certainly appreciate that.

58:10.667 --> 58:12.000
He said not to worry.

58:12.033 --> 58:15.633
There's a bit of influenza
going around this summer.

58:15.667 --> 58:17.400
Lots of people have
come down with it.

58:17.433 --> 58:21.433
A big, strong boy like Robert,
he should have no problems
pulling through this at all.

58:22.167 --> 58:23.167
When's he coming?

58:23.867 --> 58:24.900
He'll be here this afternoon.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.100
Don't you worry.

58:28.300 --> 58:31.333
Oh, blast it. Oh, I forgot
all about it. It's Friday.

58:31.367 --> 58:32.867
What? What's wrong?

58:32.900 --> 58:35.767
Well, Tommy Berke is
shipping us that mermaid
that we ordered.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.400
- Mermaid?
- Yes, yes, yes, you remember.

58:37.433 --> 58:39.833
I told you all about it.
The stuffed mermaid.

58:39.867 --> 58:42.467
It'll be at the Brewster
shipping office today.

58:42.500 --> 58:43.667
Well...

58:43.700 --> 58:46.100
Well, we got the show tomorrow
and the weekend's here...

58:48.433 --> 58:51.533
I think I should stay with
Robert until the doctor comes.

58:51.567 --> 58:53.567
- Well, I could...
- Could, you, honey?

58:53.600 --> 58:56.100
I know it would mean that
you wouldn't be getting
back until late tonight.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.267
No, no, I mean,
I could, you know...

58:58.267 --> 59:01.967
I know. I know you want
to be here with Robert.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.033
But just in case anything
should happen, and I don't
think anything will happen.

59:06.300 --> 59:08.133
But just in case something
should happen, I think it

59:08.167 --> 59:09.667
would be better if
I were here with him.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.900
Good. Good, you better hurry.

59:14.933 --> 59:17.767
Drive carefully, take
a sweater with you,
it'll be cold tonight.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.167
Robert, you just rest.

59:24.967 --> 59:26.267
I'll be back soon, all right?

59:27.733 --> 59:28.933
Daddy will take care of you.

59:30.533 --> 59:31.767
(GROANING)

59:40.433 --> 59:41.433
(GROANING)

01:00:26.733 --> 01:00:28.833
Doctor, boy's a bit ripe.

01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:31.933
Yeah, I figure three,
maybe four days.

01:00:31.967 --> 01:00:34.500
I'll know closer when
I get him on the slab.

01:00:34.533 --> 01:00:36.233
What's the quick and dirty?

01:00:36.267 --> 01:00:37.667
Well, you can take your pick.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.933
Multiple lethal stab wounds.

01:00:39.967 --> 01:00:42.367
One hand ground nearly off.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.567
His head peeled clear
back to the skull.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.467
In case you're curious, that
was all done ante mortem,
that's before death.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.533
Do tell.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.600
So, all in all,

01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:56.033
I guess we can pretty
well rule out suicide.

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:01.867
Well, well, well.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.433
The three musketeers are here.

01:01:03.933 --> 01:01:05.500
You.

01:01:05.533 --> 01:01:06.833
What is it, Art Cooney?

01:01:06.867 --> 01:01:08.167
Yep.

01:01:08.267 --> 01:01:10.633
Let's take a
little stroll, Art.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.967
Just chat for a bit.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:18.933
Now, Art, we know that
you and Joey are like
two balls in a sack.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.067
When'd you see him last?

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.567
Hmm...

01:01:24.933 --> 01:01:26.833
You know, I don't
rightly recall.

01:01:26.867 --> 01:01:27.867
You don't?

01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:29.833
Nope.

01:01:29.867 --> 01:01:32.267
When's the last time you
remember seeing him,
try it that way.

01:01:33.267 --> 01:01:34.267
All right, I'll try.

01:01:42.267 --> 01:01:45.133
Nope. I'm sorry, nothing
comes to mind.

01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:47.267
You don't say.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.800
It all just sort of blurs
together, you know?

01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:52.567
I mean, sometimes I just can't
remember a single thing

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.067
about nothing.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.667
Oh, that's really too bad.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.267
Here. Tell you what, why
don't we try something?

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.367
Maybe help you out a bit.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.267
Now, I want you... Well, here.

01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:09.167
I want you to look
at this refrigerator.

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:11.300
Look at this dot right there.

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.433
- Concentrate.
- All right.

01:02:13.467 --> 01:02:14.767
- You lookin'?
- I'm lookin'.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.433
- You sure?
- I'm looking right at it.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.067
Ow!

01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:20.933
Ahhh! Jesus.

01:02:20.967 --> 01:02:24.133
Maybe that'll help
your memory, you little
shit stain, huh?

01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:26.400
Sunday! Sunday, Jesus!

01:02:26.433 --> 01:02:28.500
Tell me all about it.

01:02:28.533 --> 01:02:31.267
He got into a fight with Tank
down by the lake, all right?

01:02:31.267 --> 01:02:33.667
Last time I saw him, he said
he was gonna pay him a visit.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.167
He and that girl he was with.

01:02:35.267 --> 01:02:36.300
What girl?

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:37.500
Ow!

01:02:37.533 --> 01:02:39.900
I don't know her name.
Magrew's daughter.

01:02:39.933 --> 01:02:43.433
You know, the old man
who runs that freak show
out on Lovejoy.

01:02:43.467 --> 01:02:46.667
So, he said he was gonna
go over there and you
haven't seen him since?

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.033
I swear to God,
I haven't seen him, okay?

01:02:49.067 --> 01:02:51.800
God... I think you
broke my nose.

01:02:53.733 --> 01:02:56.567
Don't worry about it, son.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.033
It'll give you
a little character.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.633

I'm sorry to have waken you.

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:45.267

easier if you'd stayed asleep.

You're like most men.
Sick in the soul.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.033
You spend your whole life
struggling to be something
different than you are.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.833
I want you to relax now.

01:04:01.867 --> 01:04:03.333

I mean you no harm.

There will be no more
conflicts, no more tearing
yourself up inside.

01:04:11.367 --> 01:04:12.567
You will be one thing.

01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:19.733
No, don't worry about her.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.633
I know about you two,
but I'm not angry.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.667
That was in the past.

01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:28.000
But now, we must
look to your future.

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.267
Brilliant work.

01:04:34.433 --> 01:04:35.833
Brilliant work, Robert.

01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:51.833
