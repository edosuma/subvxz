WEBVTT

00:33.076 --> 00:35.383
In less than 24 hours,
I'll be dead.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.965
I don't know it yet.

00:53.009 --> 00:56.012
That's why I'm talking
like this.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.105
I'm the only one
standing behind a fence,

01:02.149 --> 01:04.716
watching the parade race by.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.552
Then it's gone.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.736
I don't believe in love.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.004
Baby, can you zip me up?

02:25.493 --> 02:28.060
I, uh... I talked to
the travel agent this morning.

02:28.104 --> 02:30.889
Bora Bora, one week.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.848
You and me.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.521
I don't need that.No. Come on.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.440
I don't want that.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.489
You're mine.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.840
You're mine.

03:45.877 --> 03:49.141
I know you're trying hard
to hold it all together.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.143
Look.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.930
It takes time.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.541
This is... It's a process.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.762
Doesn't happen overnight.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.464
Just don't do anything
irrational.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.782
I gotta go.

04:56.818 --> 04:59.473
The company can't lend you
anything else right now.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.885
We need to keep
our current staff afloat.

05:00.909 --> 05:01.866
I don't wanna lose anyone.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.912
I'll manage, Laz.
I always do.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.566
Hell, you can tell Lucy,
in reality

05:05.609 --> 05:07.219
it's her father
that's pressing this.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.570
I'm sure she can
help you sort it out.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.964
Let's talk tomorrow.

05:36.684 --> 05:40.688
You know, I've never worked
in all my life.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.647
In all my life,
I've never worked.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.476
I've been thinking about that.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.784
What did you say? I didn't say anything.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.438
You did too.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.092
You said I was very fond
of expensive things...

05:54.136 --> 05:56.747
Furs and jewels and things.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.923
Did I say that?

05:58.967 --> 06:02.492
I guess you and I have been,
more or less, used to...

06:02.536 --> 06:04.538
a life of pink champagne.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.994
Could you?

07:11.126 --> 07:12.475
Anthony.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.565
You all right?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.395
Yeah.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.919
I'm fine.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.355
My father says he's been trying

07:23.399 --> 07:24.487
to get a hold of you.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.228
Says you haven't
returned his calls.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.665
You know, I hate talking
business with you two.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.928
I'll call him.
Thank you.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.846
Talked to Nathan today.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.416
He's excited about tomorrow.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.644
Dance with me.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.350
Mmm.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.795
Oh, we have to go. No, no.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.449
We have to go.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.844
I'm gonna take my own car.

08:16.887 --> 08:24.887
I'm gonna have drinks
with Valerie after.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.702
Whoa.
Fucking dick!

09:09.679 --> 09:11.072
Thanks.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.154
Is, uh, this seat taken?

09:52.809 --> 09:55.856
Well, it's fate.

09:55.899 --> 09:59.163
I don't believe in that,
but I'll take the seat.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.341
Pity.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.780
Uh, scotch, please.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.883
Miss?

10:25.842 --> 10:27.365
You can't smoke in here.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.021
Sorry.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.504
Come on.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.363
What's your name?

11:09.930 --> 11:12.410
I'm called Kat.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.499
Uh, Ben.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.893
Rawlins.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.156
You don't look like a Ben.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.202
Ah, it's a middle name.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.338
I will not release this
into your custody...

11:28.905 --> 11:31.647
until you tell me.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.171
It's just gonna go out.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.393
Then I'll just wait
until you light another one.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.846
Letholdus.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.415
Now, that...

12:00.458 --> 12:02.373
That sounds like a middle name.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.593
It doesn't sound
like any kind of name.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.595
Well, I smell a story.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.515
Letholdus was the first knight

12:13.558 --> 12:15.125
over the wall of Jerusalem

12:15.169 --> 12:17.040
in the first crusade.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.173
So it's noble.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.653
No one calls me that. Why not?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.874
I don't know.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.400
Why are you so interested?

12:35.580 --> 12:38.148
You know, it's strange.

12:40.237 --> 12:43.066
We're out here listening
to the world go by,

12:43.110 --> 12:45.416
and we know
there's people out there,

12:45.460 --> 12:49.246
even though we can't see them.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.379
I always wonder
what their story is.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.040
I'm still curious
why no one calls you that.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.832
Fine. I'll find out
sooner or later.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.400
Wait.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.402
You've got an eyelash.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.360
Make a wish.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.886
Hmm.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.365
Quickly!

13:26.501 --> 13:29.852
Guys, you can't smoke
out here either.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.725
I'm not... We're not smoking.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.379
Dude.

13:38.556 --> 13:42.256
I used to dance to this
when I was little.

13:42.299 --> 13:45.215
It always used to
make me feel so free.

13:45.259 --> 13:48.175
I don't feel that way anymore.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.917
So, what are you then?

13:52.179 --> 13:54.311
What would you find
more enticing...

13:54.355 --> 13:56.096
The answer or the mystery?

13:59.621 --> 14:01.492
To mystery.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.625
Cheers.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.671
Mmm.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.674
Another one? Ah, yeah, please.

14:09.718 --> 14:12.025
I'm gonna start
charging you for those.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.070
I don't pay for things.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.246
Ah, another piece of the puzzle.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.509
I wouldn't try to solve me.

14:18.553 --> 14:19.989
Come on. Everybody
wants someone

14:20.033 --> 14:22.296
to solve them, don't they?

14:22.339 --> 14:23.775
Not me.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.429
Why not?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.044
'Cause everything important
gets taken away.

14:32.784 --> 14:35.091
Good evening, sir.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.964
Ma'am? Could I
get something started

14:38.007 --> 14:39.966
for the two of you?

14:40.009 --> 14:45.667
Gin with tonic
and your driest Pinot Noir.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.756
Right away, sir.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.283
Hello.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.245
You know him?

14:58.288 --> 15:01.857
You remember Bailey Steinfeld.
It's her cousin, Ben.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.772
From Kentucky.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.141
She wanted me
to show him around the city,

15:05.165 --> 15:08.298
so it's the least I could do.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.779
- Nice to meet you, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.435
I don't hear an accent.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.220
Uh, we, uh...
We moved around a lot.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.572
Aren't you going
to introduce me?

15:21.616 --> 15:24.097
- And you are?
- I'm Kat.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.229
Maddox.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.666
Kat's Rommel Lazarus's niece.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.976
Yes. My mother's
his sister... Lily.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.288
We were just gonna go, uh,
get a table and have a drink.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.290
Why don't we join you?

15:45.901 --> 15:47.250
Sure.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.143
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.019
Sir? Gin and tonic.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.934
Enjoy.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.588
Waiter.

16:21.763 --> 16:24.026
You can call me Gerry, sir.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.594
Gerry, this has
too much tonic in it.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.554
I asked for gin with tonic.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.687
"With" means 10% tonic.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.342
So sorry. A real drink.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.648
I'll fix it right now. A man's drink.
Do you understand?

16:37.692 --> 16:40.129
Yes, sir. You don't need to do that.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.176
Look, I know what I want.
And now he knows what I want.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.525
Now he's gonna get it for me.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.448
Alright you don't need
to talk to him like that.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.357
Was I wrong, Ben?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.359
Huh? Was I wrong?

16:53.534 --> 16:56.885
Oh, uh, no, you were not wrong.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.716
Here you are, sir.
Gin and tonic.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.761
Ten percent.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.722
Perfect, Gerry.

17:07.765 --> 17:11.117
So, how did the two of you
get thrown together?

17:11.160 --> 17:14.555
Oh, well, uh,

17:14.598 --> 17:16.992
he was gallant.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.779
Rommel. Someone's
actually named that, huh?

17:21.823 --> 17:23.868
I thought I had a bad name.

17:23.912 --> 17:27.611
What are you talking about?
Your name is Benjamin.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.614
Well, no, it's not.

17:32.399 --> 17:35.619
Erwin Rommel.
He was a Nazi field general.

17:38.187 --> 17:42.148
Considered to be the most humane
and ingenious of his kind.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.412
Still a Nazi though.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.038
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.127
Excuse me.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.781
Ah, yeah.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.105
I have to use the restroom too.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.672
If you guys will excuse me.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.567
My shift ended.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.003
Ah.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.703
Have a good one. Have a good night, man.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.806
Really?

20:28.227 --> 20:31.491
You okay?

20:31.534 --> 20:32.927
You know, I have this theory.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.165
You can tell a lot
about a person

20:34.189 --> 20:36.757
when you see them
standing alone.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.760
That right?

20:39.803 --> 20:41.805
I learned a lot.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.330
About?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.377
I don't think I should tell you.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.862
Go on. Tell me.

20:57.125 --> 21:01.172
You're hiding something.
A secret.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.262
Maybe more than one.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.438
The trick is, you've learned
to hide the hiding.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.315
You know this based
on what exactly?

21:13.359 --> 21:14.838
Well, it takes one to know one.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.851
You wanna get out of here?

21:29.636 --> 21:31.681
Me and you.
I mean, it's just...

21:31.725 --> 21:33.857
It's kind of a lot
to handle right now.

21:33.901 --> 21:38.035
You wanna just...
cut out maybe?

21:40.429 --> 21:41.822
I can't.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.959
Don't leave me alone with them.

21:56.271 --> 21:59.143
We were getting ready
to send out a search party.

21:59.187 --> 22:02.669
Ben and I were just saying,
it's about to get busy in here.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.062
Maybe we should just
continue this at your place.

22:06.542 --> 22:09.066
Our house?

22:10.720 --> 22:13.506
- Lucy's meeting someone later.
- Oh, I can cancel.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.379
Ben.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.990
What do you say?

22:20.034 --> 22:22.384
I'm sure he has
somewhere better to go.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.172
Actually, I don't.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.392
Nothin' better at least.

22:30.436 --> 22:34.570
Anthony, why don't you take Kat,
and Benjamin will ride with me.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.920
I want him to see
the city at night.

22:37.921 --> 22:40.359
Shall we? I'll get the check.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.342
Who is she?

23:11.868 --> 23:14.175
I don't know.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.873
If you ever... I swear to God...

23:16.917 --> 23:18.048
I... What?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.054
I'm sorry.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.378
I'm just happy that you're here.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.192
I don't believe you.
In my house?

23:32.498 --> 23:34.848
You better not
say anything to her.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.632
Nothing.

23:36.676 --> 23:39.243
You promise me.Promise.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.152
You've a beautiful home.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.502
Thank you.
We're very comfortable here.

24:20.546 --> 24:23.244
It's been in the family
for years.

24:23.287 --> 24:26.726
Please... sit down.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.989
Make yourself comfortable.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.905
Anthony, darling.

24:31.948 --> 24:34.516
Why don't you make Ben a drink?

24:35.474 --> 24:36.866
We should, uh, just stay here.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.478
Oh, nonsense.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.392
Just make him the, um...

24:42.742 --> 24:44.134
Perfect drink.

24:48.965 --> 24:52.012
Kat?
Will you join us?

24:52.055 --> 24:53.448
I'm fine here.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.977
Benjamin?

25:15.252 --> 25:17.124
Is this your son?

25:17.167 --> 25:18.821
That was taken in Jackson Hole

25:18.865 --> 25:21.084
a few summers back.

25:25.480 --> 25:29.440
Oh. Sweet face.
That was preschool.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.716
Are you a cognac man?

25:45.631 --> 25:47.241
Not really.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.158
This one.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.559
You have good taste.

26:01.908 --> 26:04.258
This was bottled
before my father was born.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.567
It cost me $77,000.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.010
It's not polite to talk about

26:17.053 --> 26:20.622
the cost of things with company.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.450
Lucy would say that.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.805
It's funny.

26:31.459 --> 26:34.593
That a thing so rare
can be so insignificant.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.868
Do you have a family?

26:48.911 --> 26:51.087
No, not really.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.484
You? You got kids? Yeah.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.314
We adopted a son, Nathan.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.796
He's away at camp.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.111
Have you been enjoying my wife?

27:19.202 --> 27:21.204
What was that?

27:21.944 --> 27:24.207
Lucy.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.209
She's showing you
the city, right?

27:27.210 --> 27:28.690
Yeah.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.606
Yeah, she has.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.434
How do you like it?
The city.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.789
I tend not to stick around
anywhere too long.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.358
See, I'm just the opposite.

27:47.404 --> 27:51.887
When I have something,
I can't let it go.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.763
I stay too long.

28:06.859 --> 28:07.903
Funny accident how we all

28:07.947 --> 28:09.513
found each other tonight.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.871
Should, uh...
Should we head back?

28:26.487 --> 28:29.272
Ben has great taste.
The '29.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.495
Lucy was just telling me
about your son.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.715
He's learning
how to play tennis.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.717
Oh, is he?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.284
He's very athletic
and he's so smart.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.290
- Ladies?
- Cheers.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.164
Benjamin?

28:52.687 --> 28:54.341
Thanks.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.996
Nazdarovya.Hmm.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.998
Nazdarovya.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.956
To a good night.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.964
So is he here?
Your son.

29:09.008 --> 29:11.053
Is he sleeping?
Should we be quiet?

29:11.097 --> 29:13.926
- Oh, actually...
- Lucy.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.798
Can I talk to you?

29:16.842 --> 29:18.191
Okay.

29:20.541 --> 29:24.240
- Now.
- Uh, excuse us.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.722
We'll be just a minute.

29:31.726 --> 29:34.294
Why are you doing this?
So rude.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.473
What are you doing?

29:59.058 --> 30:01.147
I want to smoke.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.891
What if this is my last one?

30:07.588 --> 30:10.156
Well, then I'd take it from you.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.195
What's your fantasy?

31:10.216 --> 31:12.131
There you are.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.490
Well, what is it?

31:29.365 --> 31:31.890
Uh, to be free. Of what?

31:36.677 --> 31:38.418
I don't know.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.076
What's yours?

31:49.690 --> 31:51.605
To die young.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.365
You didn't really
mean that, did you?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.847
What are you doing?

32:19.676 --> 32:21.591
What are you doing?

32:22.549 --> 32:24.116
You're not coming in?

32:27.206 --> 32:29.556
I, um...

32:29.599 --> 32:31.514
I just wonder where they went.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.647
You really care?

32:35.214 --> 32:36.867
No. I just, uh...

32:36.911 --> 32:39.261
They could be fucking.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.350
No.

32:41.394 --> 32:44.005
They haven't in months.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.833
He told me.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.705
He told you that?

32:53.406 --> 32:56.191
I just think, uh... I don't...

32:56.235 --> 32:58.759
People's private lives
should stay private.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.022
See, that's your problem.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.155
You want everything
to be like a dream.

33:03.198 --> 33:06.027
But it's not a dream.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.856
Sex is sex.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.249
Fucking is fucking.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.558
Don't be such a prude.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.605
I'm not a prude.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.392
You afraid to jump?

33:43.412 --> 33:45.023
I'm not a prude.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.507
So, where does she keep you?

35:22.903 --> 35:24.252
What?

35:25.384 --> 35:27.734
Where does Mrs. Bishop
keep you?

35:29.039 --> 35:30.780
I know you don't work.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.871
I'm a writer.

35:34.915 --> 35:38.179
Right.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.876
I am.

35:42.749 --> 35:45.752
Have I read any of your work?

35:45.795 --> 35:48.711
'Cause I read everything.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.802
I was published.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.110
How long ago?

35:58.243 --> 35:59.635
Four years.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.944
So you don't work.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.730
I'm not judging.

36:09.689 --> 36:12.866
You're imagining things, Kat.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.218
I can smell one of my own kind.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.741
Don't.
It's not like that.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.178
Why? Why not?

36:21.701 --> 36:23.093
Some writer.

36:26.096 --> 36:28.229
You're with a married man.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.884
It's more complicated
than that. Oh, is it? Is it?

36:32.277 --> 36:33.452
What is it,

36:33.495 --> 36:34.559
like some kind of act
or something?

36:34.583 --> 36:37.064
It's all an act, Ben.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.805
We give people
the versions of ourselves

36:38.848 --> 36:41.199
they need to feel safe.

36:41.242 --> 36:44.027
I give him what he needs,
so he gives me what I want.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.470
What does that mean?

36:51.513 --> 36:53.863
It means he pays for my life.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.388
For all of it.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.656
So you're a whore.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.484
Don't do that.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.138
No, say it with me.
Say it with me.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.793
"I'm a whore."

37:10.837 --> 37:12.839
You're one to talk.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.762
Lucy's showing me the city.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.155
Oh, I bet.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.815
So, where does he keep you, huh?

37:36.341 --> 37:38.517
Where does he keep his whore?

37:38.560 --> 37:41.171
A loft in the marina.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.872
Your turn.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.527
Why should I have to
tell you anything?

37:48.570 --> 37:50.746
Because I can't stand a liar,

37:51.747 --> 37:54.968
and I liked standing you.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.589
Downtown.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.423
She keeps me downtown.

38:27.696 --> 38:30.612
I like we're being honest.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.353
Honest?

38:32.397 --> 38:33.789
Back there...

38:43.277 --> 38:46.019
Things are getting
quite serious, aren't they?

38:48.151 --> 38:50.676
Let's go look around some more.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.460
I don't wanna look around.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.085
You're beautiful.

39:57.830 --> 40:00.963
Sometimes dirty things
have a kind of beauty.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.242
This can't lead anyplace.

40:21.593 --> 40:22.985
I know.

40:53.494 --> 40:56.497
Now that I've found you,

40:56.541 --> 40:58.891
I don't want to let you go.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.421
We really should
get back downstairs.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.903
Anthony?

41:10.946 --> 41:12.600
What?

41:12.644 --> 41:15.603
Are you listening
to me? Yes.

41:22.088 --> 41:25.265
Where did you get this? What?

41:25.308 --> 41:27.528
This bra.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.791
I don't think I've ever
seen you wear it before.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.306
What's this?

42:08.613 --> 42:10.179
This...

42:12.660 --> 42:14.357
is a tattoo.

42:14.401 --> 42:16.708
Come on.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.928
It's, uh...

42:19.972 --> 42:23.018
It's the name of a song that
my father would sing me

42:23.062 --> 42:25.978
when I was a kid to
put me to sleep.

42:26.021 --> 42:28.110
"Szerelem."

42:28.154 --> 42:30.635
It, uh, means "love"
in Hungarian.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.161
Well, what's the song say?

42:35.204 --> 42:37.511
It's in Hungarian.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.426
Tell me your favorite part.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.080
Um...

42:44.953 --> 42:47.956
Favorite part is, um...

42:51.220 --> 42:55.311
"I would do anything
for my old lover.

42:55.355 --> 42:57.487
I would dip the water
of the sea.

42:59.402 --> 43:02.144
I would pick shells
from the seabed,

43:02.188 --> 43:06.105
and I would sew a wreath
for my old lover."

43:11.153 --> 43:13.591
Tell me about him...

43:14.679 --> 43:16.637
Your father.

43:23.339 --> 43:24.689
Um...

43:28.127 --> 43:29.519
He was, uh, you know,

43:29.563 --> 43:33.741
the strongest man in the world
to me when I was a kid.

43:33.785 --> 43:35.656
You know how you think
when you're a kid.

43:35.700 --> 43:39.660
He was...
He was a superhero to me.

43:39.704 --> 43:42.532
You know, my book
was about my parents.

43:46.188 --> 43:48.103
Tell me about your mom.

43:51.803 --> 43:57.809
My mother... passed away
when I was seven.

44:03.641 --> 44:06.426
It crushed my father.

44:06.469 --> 44:08.123
It devastated him.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.910
He, um...

44:14.739 --> 44:16.566
He lost it... all that...

44:16.610 --> 44:19.831
That strength
that made him great.

44:19.874 --> 44:23.225
And I watched it all melt away
when I was a kid.

44:26.968 --> 44:28.578
He would cry to me.

44:28.622 --> 44:32.278
He would cry to me,
a seven, eight-year-old kid.

44:33.279 --> 44:37.326
And he'd be sobbing, um,

44:37.370 --> 44:39.720
telling me how much
he missed her,

44:41.026 --> 44:43.028
how much he needed her.

44:44.594 --> 44:46.509
I wouldn't know what to say.

44:46.553 --> 44:47.641
You know, why would...

44:47.685 --> 44:51.993
How would I know what to say?

44:52.037 --> 44:54.648
And everyone else,
they were telling him

44:54.692 --> 44:56.911
that it wasn't his fault,

44:56.955 --> 45:00.436
that she was just
an unhappy person.

45:00.480 --> 45:05.311
But...
he wasn't hearing it.

45:09.054 --> 45:11.752
He took the full weight of it.
He blamed himself.

45:15.582 --> 45:16.931
You know,

45:18.454 --> 45:21.196
I remember having
the distinct thought that...

45:23.155 --> 45:27.376
how is anything in the world...

45:27.420 --> 45:29.422
worth that much pain?

45:37.560 --> 45:41.608
And from that point on,
you know, he, uh...

45:41.651 --> 45:43.697
It was like he had
two different lives.

45:43.741 --> 45:47.483
There was the life
while my mother was alive,

45:47.527 --> 45:50.225
and there was the life after.

45:54.447 --> 45:56.449
Whatever it was,

45:57.624 --> 46:00.018
I stayed in this life.

46:03.412 --> 46:05.371
Letholdus.

46:07.112 --> 46:08.722
Uh-huh.

46:14.510 --> 46:16.425
I was supposed to see him today.

46:18.297 --> 46:20.038
But you didn't? Mm-mmm.

46:26.958 --> 46:29.177
Tell me something
about your parents.

46:30.483 --> 46:31.876
Your family.

46:39.274 --> 46:41.755
Don't.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.801
Come on.

46:49.937 --> 46:51.939
Come on.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.424
All right.

47:23.492 --> 47:26.017
We danced to Stravinsky
on our wedding day.

47:27.322 --> 47:29.803
Why's that so important?

47:29.847 --> 47:31.805
I used to love Stravinsky.

47:37.158 --> 47:40.683
Dance with me,
Mrs. Bishop.

47:40.727 --> 47:42.468
Oh, so that's why we're here.

47:46.167 --> 47:47.865
I remembered us.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.651
I remembered the day.

47:53.305 --> 47:55.916
Can't a man love his wife?

47:58.963 --> 48:01.400
Anthony,

48:01.443 --> 48:03.445
you can't just change
everything back

48:03.489 --> 48:06.144
the way it was
because you want to.

48:09.016 --> 48:14.108
All this... what we have...
Is nothing.

48:14.152 --> 48:15.631
You're nothing.

48:21.202 --> 48:22.900
What are you doing?
Ow!

48:22.943 --> 48:24.553
You act like a cunt,
then I am going

48:24.597 --> 48:25.250
to treat you like a cunt.

48:25.293 --> 48:26.686
Stop... Stop it!

48:28.122 --> 48:29.776
No!

48:34.737 --> 48:36.391
Get out!

48:36.435 --> 48:37.871
What?

48:37.915 --> 48:39.481
You gonna swap me out
for the boy?

48:39.525 --> 48:41.657
He's more of a man than you.

48:44.399 --> 48:46.314
Fuck. You get up.

48:46.358 --> 48:48.708
Get up! Fuck you.

48:48.751 --> 48:50.144
Get up!

48:50.188 --> 48:51.450
Ow!

48:57.717 --> 48:59.153
What, are you gonna shoot me?

48:59.197 --> 49:00.589
Go ahead.

49:00.633 --> 49:02.983
Go ahead and shoot me.Wait. Stop!

49:09.990 --> 49:12.819
You didn't want
to dance with me,

49:12.862 --> 49:15.517
so you're going to dance for me.

49:15.561 --> 49:17.606
Do you understand?

49:19.217 --> 49:21.959
Come on.

49:23.786 --> 49:25.136
Yeah.

49:44.938 --> 49:49.029
Harder. Harder!

49:54.252 --> 49:56.950
That's right.

50:02.216 --> 50:05.611
Yeah. Harder.
Harder.

50:08.179 --> 50:11.312
Fucking harder.
Fuck.

50:11.356 --> 50:12.748
Yeah.
That's right.

50:15.882 --> 50:17.623
Now turn around.

50:20.147 --> 50:23.411
Please. Please. Please.

50:23.455 --> 50:26.501
Please. Please. Please.

50:27.415 --> 50:28.460
Please.

50:32.072 --> 50:33.160
Baby, please.

50:33.204 --> 50:35.293
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

50:39.297 --> 50:40.907
Anthony.

51:50.063 --> 51:51.630
Yeah, hi. Hi.

51:51.673 --> 51:55.590
I need a cab
as soon as possible.

51:55.634 --> 51:59.028
Yeah. Uh,
54 Alighieri Drive.

52:00.247 --> 52:02.597
Thirty minutes?
Thank you. Thank you.

52:06.166 --> 52:09.648
Hey, Laz. Um...

52:11.302 --> 52:13.608
It's-It's Lucy.

52:13.652 --> 52:16.394
Um, I-I really need
to talk to you.

52:17.395 --> 52:19.397
Can you come by later?

52:59.263 --> 53:01.221
I got a cab.

53:04.442 --> 53:08.185
I told you... I can't.

53:25.811 --> 53:28.248
You've gotta stop running
at some point.

53:31.686 --> 53:33.775
You pigeonholing me?

53:33.819 --> 53:36.125
I mean, what are you
doing here, Kat?

53:36.169 --> 53:37.910
Why are you with this guy?

53:39.303 --> 53:41.870
You don't know what
you're talking about.

53:41.914 --> 53:44.046
I know you're better than this.

53:44.090 --> 53:46.788
You're better than
what he makes you into.

53:52.054 --> 53:54.274
There you two are.

53:56.537 --> 53:58.583
Everything okay?

54:02.978 --> 54:04.980
Benjamin, would you excuse us?

54:55.030 --> 54:56.597
What's going on?

54:56.641 --> 54:59.034
Nothing.

54:59.078 --> 55:01.080
I know you, Kat.
You don't do nothing.

55:03.778 --> 55:05.780
Where were you?

55:14.093 --> 55:15.442
You fucked him, didn't you?

55:17.618 --> 55:19.925
No, say, "No, Anthony,
I didn't fuck him."

55:19.968 --> 55:22.406
He can hear you. That's not an answer.

55:23.537 --> 55:25.539
Anthony, don't...

55:27.236 --> 55:28.586
Kat.

55:33.417 --> 55:37.943
I need you. What about
what I need?

55:37.986 --> 55:41.120
I give you everything. No, you don't.
You give me nothing.

55:43.035 --> 55:45.037
Not what I want.

55:47.431 --> 55:49.737
I'm your whore.
That's all.

55:54.176 --> 55:55.743
Please.

56:02.359 --> 56:04.883
Give me what I want.

56:12.064 --> 56:14.066
I don't have him.

56:15.459 --> 56:17.243
He's not here.

56:33.999 --> 56:37.698
You were gone a while.
Did you get lost?

56:57.501 --> 57:01.026
Not...
Lucy, not right now.
Anthony might see.

57:01.069 --> 57:03.115
Anthony doesn't see anything.

57:05.552 --> 57:07.902
You remember our story, huh?

57:13.038 --> 57:17.521
I would do anything for you.

57:17.564 --> 57:20.611
You know that,
right? Anything.

57:20.654 --> 57:22.961
Anything you want.

57:32.100 --> 57:34.233
You took care of me.

57:35.495 --> 57:37.236
You took care of me.

57:55.384 --> 57:58.300
You want her. What? What?

57:59.563 --> 58:01.521
No.

58:01.565 --> 58:03.871
Then why... why'd you
tell her your name?

58:06.395 --> 58:09.200
What are you talking about? Your
real name, Ben. Your real fucking name.

58:09.224 --> 58:11.096
You told her. What are you... Chill.

58:11.139 --> 58:13.141
Don't you fucking...
Don't you fucking

58:13.185 --> 58:14.186
tell me to shut up!

58:14.229 --> 58:15.337
What's gotten into you
right now?

58:15.361 --> 58:16.773
You are mine.
I will take what is mine.

58:16.797 --> 58:18.712
Will you fucking
tell me the truth? Calm down.

58:18.756 --> 58:20.888
Stop.
What are you doing? Just tell me the truth!

58:20.932 --> 58:24.631
Shh. Shh.

58:35.120 --> 58:37.949
Anthony, Laz is here.

58:40.255 --> 58:42.257
What is he doing here?

58:42.301 --> 58:44.172
I'm gonna take care of it.

58:46.784 --> 58:49.526
What did you do? I can't
believe you called Laz.

59:02.016 --> 59:04.105
Laz, how are you?

59:04.149 --> 59:07.892
I am well, Tony. Thanks.
Everything okay?

59:07.935 --> 59:10.938
Yeah.
Everything's great.

59:10.982 --> 59:14.594
I got your message.
What was so urgent?

59:14.638 --> 59:17.423
I'm sorry about that. Lucy and I just
had an argument.

59:18.642 --> 59:20.295
It's okay.

59:20.339 --> 59:22.689
What about the company?

59:22.733 --> 59:24.430
What's wrong with the company?

59:24.473 --> 59:25.823
Nothing's wrong.

59:25.866 --> 59:27.955
Laz, it was just
a misunderstanding.

59:27.999 --> 59:29.914
We're fine.

59:29.957 --> 59:31.611
Good to hear.

59:31.655 --> 59:34.527
Uh, uh, Laz, what...
How's Katherine?

59:37.574 --> 59:39.532
My poor daughter, Kat.

59:42.666 --> 59:44.842
She's been a mess
for some time now.

59:47.018 --> 59:51.109
My first wife raised her
in England of all places.

59:53.285 --> 59:55.330
She doesn't talk
to anyone in the family.

59:56.810 --> 1:00:00.074
They called me when she tried...

1:00:00.118 --> 1:00:01.510
Tried...

1:00:06.254 --> 1:00:08.039
You never met her
after all these years?

1:00:10.171 --> 1:00:13.348
I think...

1:00:13.392 --> 1:00:16.003
we should continue this
in the living room.

1:00:16.047 --> 1:00:18.223
I guess I could stay a bit,
now that I'm here.

1:00:18.266 --> 1:00:19.920
You know what?
Let's just stay here.

1:00:19.964 --> 1:00:21.182
No, actually, you know,

1:00:21.226 --> 1:00:22.682
the living room is much
more comfortable.

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:24.621
Yeah, we can listen to that...

1:00:24.664 --> 1:00:26.144
Stravinsky you
used to talk about.

1:00:26.187 --> 1:00:29.103
I just prefer to stay here.

1:00:40.985 --> 1:00:42.900
I lied to you before.

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:48.253
About?

1:00:53.214 --> 1:00:54.520
"He thought she must be bouncing

1:00:54.563 --> 1:00:58.524
between the most
beautiful dreams,

1:00:58.567 --> 1:01:01.658
as her eyes fluttered,
threatening to wake.

1:01:03.529 --> 1:01:06.575
We were stripped bare
in every sense imaginable.

1:01:09.143 --> 1:01:12.190
Very rarely did I smile
after those days but,

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:14.496
who could help it?

1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:17.238
We had made such
beautiful poetry together."

1:01:25.856 --> 1:01:27.466
That's mine.

1:01:28.728 --> 1:01:30.730
I loved your book.

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:32.906
It didn't drone on.

1:01:32.950 --> 1:01:38.259
It had a beginning,
middle and end.

1:01:38.303 --> 1:01:40.958
I told you I read everything.

1:01:45.179 --> 1:01:46.964
What do you want from me?

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.664
Everything.

1:01:53.057 --> 1:01:55.233
I can't help you.

1:01:57.888 --> 1:02:01.848
Look, Kat, this-this fantasy
that you want to live in...

1:02:03.676 --> 1:02:05.286
There's no future in it.

1:02:05.330 --> 1:02:07.375
Don't do that.

1:02:09.987 --> 1:02:11.597
There's no future in it.

1:02:12.424 --> 1:02:14.295
Stop it.

1:02:14.339 --> 1:02:16.733
There's no future in it. Stop!

1:02:16.776 --> 1:02:18.778
- There's no future in it!
- Stop it!

1:02:18.822 --> 1:02:20.519
There's no future, Kat.

1:02:20.562 --> 1:02:22.347
Stop it.

1:02:50.854 --> 1:02:52.507
No!

1:02:54.509 --> 1:02:56.250
Nathan!

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.384
No.

1:03:07.261 --> 1:03:09.350
Nathan's your son.

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:18.751
And Lucy doesn't know?

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:21.841
It's his birthday tomorrow.

1:03:21.885 --> 1:03:23.887
And no one helped you.

1:03:29.457 --> 1:03:31.590
Anthony and I...

1:03:33.287 --> 1:03:35.942
Ihad a problem.

1:03:38.249 --> 1:03:42.427
They took him from me.
They said I wasn't fit.

1:03:42.470 --> 1:03:45.691
To be his mother? To be his anything.

1:03:52.611 --> 1:03:55.309
I signed the paper.

1:03:55.353 --> 1:03:58.922
I signed it with this hand.

1:04:03.404 --> 1:04:06.233
They'll be back soon.

1:04:06.277 --> 1:04:10.281
- We can tell them.
- Tell them what exactly?

1:04:11.543 --> 1:04:15.547
Kat, I... I know you now.

1:04:20.465 --> 1:04:22.728
Now I don't want to know you.

1:05:00.505 --> 1:05:03.247
Hey.
I'm going downtown.

1:06:22.413 --> 1:06:23.718
How are you two?

1:06:28.506 --> 1:06:30.377
I know Nathan's back tomorrow.

1:06:32.075 --> 1:06:33.032
How was it having him away

1:06:33.076 --> 1:06:34.381
at camp for the first time?

1:06:36.601 --> 1:06:38.733
You really want to know?

1:06:40.387 --> 1:06:41.780
Really?

1:06:43.738 --> 1:06:45.088
Lucy.

1:06:46.654 --> 1:06:49.179
I don't care anymore.

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:53.400
This isn't my business.

1:06:53.444 --> 1:06:55.074
Anthony and I have both
been having affairs.

1:06:55.098 --> 1:06:57.230
That's why we're in here,
because our lovers,

1:06:57.274 --> 1:06:58.188
well, they're in
the living room.

1:06:58.231 --> 1:06:59.624
Right now.

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:01.887
I should be going. No, no, no.
You asked...

1:07:01.930 --> 1:07:04.672
Really. It's late. I gotta...
I should be getting back.

1:07:04.716 --> 1:07:07.675
No, Laz.
She's telling the truth.

1:07:15.553 --> 1:07:17.076
You ever stop to think about

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:21.298
the millions of little things
in people's lives...

1:07:21.341 --> 1:07:23.387
that pull them apart?

1:07:32.918 --> 1:07:34.876
See, in life,
we bleed for people.

1:07:36.487 --> 1:07:39.055
I mean, that's what
love is... blood.

1:07:42.884 --> 1:07:45.061
So we bleed until
there's nothing left.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:57.682
Lucy, she's...

1:08:07.170 --> 1:08:09.737
You've taken all the blood
I have for you.

1:08:12.697 --> 1:08:14.090
I'm dried up.

1:08:20.574 --> 1:08:22.010
Nothing.

1:09:32.472 --> 1:09:34.387
This isn't you, Kat.

1:09:35.649 --> 1:09:37.651
This is bullshit.

1:09:39.523 --> 1:09:41.220
You and me, we're not.

1:09:42.613 --> 1:09:44.267
Didn't you feel it?

1:09:44.310 --> 1:09:45.746
No, you fucked me.

1:09:45.790 --> 1:09:48.053
He fucked me too.

1:09:48.096 --> 1:09:51.665
Is this shit all you care about?

1:09:51.709 --> 1:09:55.191
Your-Your allowance
and your-your penthouse?

1:09:55.234 --> 1:09:57.628
And-And your fucking
Jimmy Choos?

1:09:57.671 --> 1:09:59.282
Is that what you want to hear?

1:09:59.325 --> 1:10:01.240
At least it'd be honest.

1:10:01.284 --> 1:10:04.548
I want my son, Ben.

1:10:04.591 --> 1:10:07.115
I want to watch him sleep!

1:10:07.159 --> 1:10:08.987
I want to smell him
in the morning!

1:10:09.030 --> 1:10:11.685
I want...
I want to wipe his tears.

1:10:11.729 --> 1:10:13.121
I need him.

1:10:15.472 --> 1:10:17.343
Look at me.

1:10:19.867 --> 1:10:23.262
I can help. Why do you want
to help me?

1:10:23.306 --> 1:10:25.090
You know who I am.

1:10:29.486 --> 1:10:32.706
There's no one out there
for people like us.

1:11:37.902 --> 1:11:39.295
Who's this?

1:11:42.385 --> 1:11:44.125
Laz, let me explain.

1:11:44.169 --> 1:11:46.780
Laz, what are you doing?

1:11:46.824 --> 1:11:48.652
Shut up, Lucy.

1:11:48.695 --> 1:11:52.220
Come with me.
Take my hand.

1:11:53.657 --> 1:11:54.658
Katherine.

1:11:56.268 --> 1:11:58.357
Don't call me that.

1:11:58.401 --> 1:12:00.838
You can't tell me what to do.

1:12:00.881 --> 1:12:02.535
You only care now
because you're here

1:12:02.579 --> 1:12:03.580
and you see me.

1:12:03.623 --> 1:12:05.364
Come on. Just...

1:12:05.408 --> 1:12:09.063
You're a fucking sperm donor.
You're not my father.

1:12:09.107 --> 1:12:10.456
Just leave me alone.

1:12:38.049 --> 1:12:39.398
Kat.

1:12:45.926 --> 1:12:48.059
I thought your book was sad.

1:12:50.714 --> 1:12:52.716
Everyone said that.

1:12:54.848 --> 1:12:58.765
"There's no life
without you."

1:12:58.809 --> 1:13:00.201
You stole that from someone.

1:13:00.245 --> 1:13:02.247
I can't remember who.

1:13:07.208 --> 1:13:08.427
You know, I never understood

1:13:08.471 --> 1:13:10.864
why he stayed and she didn't.

1:13:12.779 --> 1:13:14.564
He had a son.

1:13:14.607 --> 1:13:18.089
He lost his love.
He was pointless.

1:13:18.132 --> 1:13:21.135
Give me that gun.

1:13:21.179 --> 1:13:22.485
And then we'll...

1:13:22.528 --> 1:13:24.748
Me and you will go
right now, okay?

1:13:24.791 --> 1:13:27.359
Let's get out of here.

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:29.970
I... I'll take care of us.

1:13:32.408 --> 1:13:34.148
What's your fantasy?

1:13:35.933 --> 1:13:38.326
I could love you.

1:13:44.811 --> 1:13:46.465
You already did.

1:13:46.509 --> 1:13:48.685
No, no!

1:13:59.347 --> 1:14:03.090
There was a book I had as a kid
about the monarch butterfly.

1:14:14.711 --> 1:14:16.843
How it became itself.

1:14:25.939 --> 1:14:27.593
The caterpillar
forms a chrysalis,

1:14:27.637 --> 1:14:29.203
then dissolves into nothing.

1:14:43.566 --> 1:14:45.350
It dies.

1:15:04.021 --> 1:15:06.153
Inside isn't a prison.

1:15:06.197 --> 1:15:09.243
It's an ocean of freedom...

1:15:09.287 --> 1:15:12.203
that stretches beyond
the stars in the sky.

1:15:14.988 --> 1:15:17.121
It shows us the future.

1:15:27.305 --> 1:15:30.830
Then when it's ready,
it rises from nothing,

1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:42.538
spreads its wings
and flies away.

1:16:17.834 --> 1:16:20.488
Now I can walk
the Great Wall of China.

1:16:24.754 --> 1:16:27.104
And go to Spain
and run with the bulls.

1:16:32.544 --> 1:16:34.764
I could start something new.

1:16:37.636 --> 1:16:39.769
And wake up with the sun.

1:16:54.827 --> 1:16:56.612
I could love.

1:16:57.874 --> 1:17:01.138
And love and love.
