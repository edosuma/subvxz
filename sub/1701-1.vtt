WEBVTT

00:48.840 --> 00:52.051
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.477
Oh, my God.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.397
Oh, my... Excuse me. Move, move,
move! Emergency, please!

01:05.607 --> 01:07.024
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.908
- Rach!
- Ah!

01:16.076 --> 01:17.534
There you are!

01:17.702 --> 01:19.620
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:19.829 --> 01:22.831
Oh! So, so.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.793
How was China? You!

01:26.419 --> 01:29.338
It was... It was great.
Oh, what happened?

01:29.506 --> 01:31.256
- What? I am?
- You're bleeding.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.050
- God.
- Oh, look at that! Yes, I am. Heh.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.303
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

01:36.471 --> 01:40.140
Come on, I wanna hear everything.
Everything!

01:41.476 --> 01:44.103
Well, uh, where do I start? Um...

01:44.270 --> 01:48.440
This is Julie.
Uh, Julie, this is Rachel.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.276
Hi. Heh.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.487
Uh, oh! These are...

01:53.655 --> 01:56.281
- These are... Aren't for you.
- Oh.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.284
Heh. Uh, these are for you.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.329
Welcome to our country.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.709
Thank you. I'm from New York.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.715
Well, not a problem.
We'll use them to stop the bleeding.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.844
Okay. Uh, baggage claim?

02:17.011 --> 02:18.512
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.478
- No way.
- I'm telling you, she went to the airport.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.438
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.

02:28.606 --> 02:32.651
Oh, my God. This is huge. This...

02:32.819 --> 02:35.070
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

02:35.238 --> 02:37.322
All right, what's bigger than huge?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.868
- Um, this?
- Yes.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.453
Guys, you got new haircuts!

02:43.621 --> 02:45.789
Yes, yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.750
Because, you know:

02:48.918 --> 02:51.253
"If you don't
look good, we don't look good."

02:51.421 --> 02:53.505
I love that voice! Ha, ha.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.508
- You guys!
- Oh, oh.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.094
Airport. Airport. Ross.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.762
Not... Not alone.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.057
Julie. Arm around her!

03:04.225 --> 03:07.895
Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

03:08.062 --> 03:10.689
Okay, I think she's trying
to tell us something.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.025
Quick, get the verbs.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.444
- Ow.
- You! You!

03:15.612 --> 03:17.112
You said he liked me!

03:17.280 --> 03:18.822
You! You...!

03:18.990 --> 03:21.450
You slowpokes!

03:21.618 --> 03:24.494
That's all right, Rach.
We got the bags. Uh...

03:24.662 --> 03:26.580
Hi. Hello.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.792
Julie, this is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.878
- Hey.
- Phoebe, hi. Mwah.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.963
- Joey, what up?
- Hey.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.717
- Everyone, this is Julie.
- Julie.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.178
Oh.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.932
Hi!

03:45.099 --> 03:47.184
Hi! But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.896
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.065
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.442
- With the screaming guy...
- And the spitting.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.736
You gotta hear this story.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.030
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.865
Two hundred, at least.

04:02.033 --> 04:05.494
- And this guy...
- And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!

04:11.042 --> 04:12.834
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.212
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

04:15.380 --> 04:17.673
Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...

04:17.839 --> 04:21.677
...and it is all I can think about.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.807
This is amazing. I mean, how...?

04:26.975 --> 04:30.060
- How did this happen?
- Ross and I were in grad school together.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.480
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

04:33.648 --> 04:36.942
...guess who's in charge of the dig?
- Julie!

04:38.611 --> 04:39.987
Julie. Isn't that great?

04:40.571 --> 04:45.200
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.329
It's an expression.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.207
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.960
- Then we're gonna go see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.546
Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.840
Well don't tell us
what's gonna happen, though

05:00.008 --> 05:01.800
Because I like to be surprised.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.723
- Bye!
- Bye.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.485
- Rach. Can I get some coffee? Thank you.
- Sure.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.362
- Hey, Rach...
- Did you talk to him yet?

05:22.530 --> 05:24.448
- No.
- Then, no.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.338
So, what the hell happened
to you in China?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.674
I mean, when last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.093
I know. I know I was.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.929
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

05:48.097 --> 05:52.184
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

05:52.935 --> 05:54.269
God?

05:55.229 --> 05:56.855
It was you, pal.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.691
Well, maybe it was God doing me.

06:01.235 --> 06:05.113
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.991
And then I met Julie, and...

06:08.159 --> 06:09.993
I don't know. We're having a great time.

06:10.161 --> 06:14.456
I never would have gone for it with her,
if it hadn't been for you.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.293
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.421
- Here's your lemonade.
- I didn't order lemonade.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.508
Oh. Well then you better go
take that back.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.259
They're gonna charge you for that.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.929
- But...
- Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

06:30.473 --> 06:33.225
Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?

06:34.018 --> 06:37.062
He said...

06:40.233 --> 06:42.526
He said they're having a great time.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.028
- I'm sorry.
- What?

06:45.196 --> 06:47.864
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

06:48.032 --> 06:51.493
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

06:51.661 --> 06:54.663
...without any outside help whatsoever.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.833
How is that a silver lining?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.627
You have to really wanna see it.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.094
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.763
Hey, Pheebs.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.808
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Oh, okay.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.355
How...

07:20.523 --> 07:23.233
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

07:23.401 --> 07:25.944
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

07:27.113 --> 07:30.740
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.869
So, what were you thinking?

07:34.036 --> 07:36.496
I was thinking
you gave the guys great haircuts.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.206
I thought you'd like to do mine.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.083
Oh! No.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.337
- Why not?
- Because I'm just...

07:44.505 --> 07:48.049
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.759
No, you're not.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.803
I know I'm not, but you are.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.097
I was trying to spare your feelings.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.059
Hello? Oh, hi.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.104
Yeah, hold on a second.
Ross, Julie for you.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.443
Hello? Hi.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.779
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.990
- You need clothes altered?
- No, no.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.868
I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.914
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.999
He did my first suit when I was 15.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.543
No, wait, 16.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.380
No, excuse me, heh, 15.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.842
All right, when was 1990?

08:32.636 --> 08:36.014
Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.441
Okay. Okay.
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.653
Okay, bye. What?

08:50.571 --> 08:53.448
Oh, that is so sweet.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.993
No... Ha, ha.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.246
No. Okay. No, you hang up.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.122
No, you... Okay.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.960
Okay. One, two, three.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.003
Shh.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.966
Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.681
Okay, no. No, you hang up.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.600
You. You. Yo...

09:29.527 --> 09:31.611
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.365
- Rachel. Heh.
- Sorry.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.784
- I'll just call her back.
- Okay.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.371
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.831
No, you hang up.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.333
Okay, okay, okay.
How did this happen to me? How?

09:45.501 --> 09:48.336
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.298
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

09:51.465 --> 09:55.010
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

09:55.636 --> 09:59.764
...ugh, this really great guy
that I can't have.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.267
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.602
I know you did.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.148
Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it.
I'm just gonna deal with it

10:11.527 --> 10:13.570
I gotta get out of here!

10:16.699 --> 10:20.035
I don't care what you guys say.
Something's bothering her.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.126
You know, I think I was 16.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.048
Please, just a little bit off the back.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.549
Um, I'm still on "no."

10:37.011 --> 10:38.928
- Uh, morning.
- Hey.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.097
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

10:41.265 --> 10:44.434
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that again.

10:46.854 --> 10:50.106
- What's going on?
- I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.067
What stupid thing did you do?

10:54.278 --> 10:55.862
Ew!

11:02.536 --> 11:04.537
Why don't you just go get dressed...

11:05.122 --> 11:08.208
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.044
Rachel, how did this happen?

11:11.212 --> 11:13.546
I don't know,
I kind of ran into him last night.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.090
- Where?
- At his apartment.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.800
Is this juice?

11:17.426 --> 11:21.179
Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

11:21.347 --> 11:24.474
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.894
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.438
Yeah. People do stupid things
when they're upset.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.692
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't...

11:37.863 --> 11:40.323
But this is about your horrible mistake.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.910
- Hi.
- Hey!

11:44.078 --> 11:46.246
- Hi...
- Sorry we're late.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.664
We were, uh...

11:47.832 --> 11:50.166
Well, there was touching.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.547
- Hey...!
- Oh.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.216
- Hey, Ross!
- Paolo. Ha.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.718
What a...

12:01.220 --> 12:03.304
What, uh...?
What are you doing here?

12:03.472 --> 12:05.306
- I do Raquel.
- Ah.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.481
So, uh, he's back?

12:13.649 --> 12:16.234
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.861
No, not a problem.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.363
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.908
Okay, you're gonna
have to not touch my ass.

12:27.121 --> 12:31.458
Well, despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

12:31.625 --> 12:33.585
...I've got pants that need to be altered.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.297
Oh, when you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.132
He'll know what it means.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.220
You sure he's gonna be able
to crack that code?

12:45.514 --> 12:49.642
It's funny. The last time Paolo was here,
my hair was so much shorter and cuter.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.395
All right. Okay.

12:52.563 --> 12:57.066
But... But! You have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

12:57.234 --> 13:00.028
...and all, you know, Monica about it.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.738
I promise.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.573
All right, let's see.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.911
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.289
But I promise,
none of you will feel a thing.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.958
Okay.

13:25.095 --> 13:28.389
- All right, that's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

13:28.557 --> 13:32.310
Yeah, but this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.396
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

13:35.564 --> 13:37.690
...doesn't trust a person.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.485
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.405
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

13:44.573 --> 13:48.076
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.870
This is how he wears it.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.458
- How who wears it?
- Demi Moore.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.503
Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.422
Well, he was a he
in Arthur and in 10.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.134
That's Dudley Moore!

14:05.302 --> 14:08.096
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

14:08.264 --> 14:10.974
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh, my God!

14:11.809 --> 14:14.143
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

14:14.311 --> 14:16.688
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

14:16.856 --> 14:18.231
Which one is Demi Moore?

14:18.399 --> 14:23.278
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

14:23.445 --> 14:25.113
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.490
- I know!
- Oh, my God!

14:33.998 --> 14:35.957
How long do you want the cuffs?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.877
At least as long as I have the pants.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.465
I just got that.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.846
Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.028
How is she?

15:05.696 --> 15:07.614
It's too soon to tell.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.367
She's resting, which is a good sign.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.288
- How's the hair?
- I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.206
It doesn't look good.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.295
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.298
Can we see her?

15:25.883 --> 15:28.009
Your hair looks too good.
It would upset her.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.387
Ross, why don't you come on in.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.980
- Well, how you doing?
- I'm okay.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.608
- Ooh, that bad, huh?
- What?

15:43.776 --> 15:47.278
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.948
It's one of my gifts. Sit.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.784
Ugh.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.956
Ugh, Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

15:58.123 --> 16:01.417
...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.

16:01.585 --> 16:05.129
But today, it's like there's rock bottom...

16:05.297 --> 16:07.256
...50 feet of crap...

16:07.424 --> 16:09.342
...then me.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.928
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.223
Oh, come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.267
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.729
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.108
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Look, Rach, Rach.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.694
I've been with my share of women.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.239
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.825
But the point is...

16:33.993 --> 16:38.121
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.666
Really?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.091
Yo, paisan.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.804
Can I talk to you for a sec?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.809
Your tailor...

17:00.019 --> 17:02.395
...is a very bad man!

17:04.481 --> 17:07.733
- Frankie? What are you talking about?
- Hey, what's going on?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.449
Joey's tailor...

17:18.244 --> 17:19.829
...took advantage of me.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.040
- What?
- No way.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.542
I've been going to the guy for 12 years.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.878
Oh, come on.
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.716
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

17:31.884 --> 17:33.301
What?

17:33.844 --> 17:35.470
Cupping.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.142
That's how they do pants!

17:42.603 --> 17:45.229
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.484
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.364
What? Ross, tell him.
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?

17:55.532 --> 17:57.617
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

18:04.750 --> 18:06.751
What's the matter with you?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.377
What?

18:11.632 --> 18:13.257
That's not?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.973
Oh, my God.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.274
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.362
I like it.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.197
Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!

18:39.576 --> 18:42.578
Thank you. My hair is very amused.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.498
Oh, come on, things could be worse.
I mean, uh...

18:45.666 --> 18:48.417
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.839
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

18:55.634 --> 18:57.260
Thank you.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.595
- Well, I gotta go. Bye.
- See you.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.055
Bye, Rach!

19:01.223 --> 19:02.890
Wait, are you leaving?

19:03.058 --> 19:05.518
That's what I meant by "bye."

19:05.686 --> 19:07.854
Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

19:08.021 --> 19:09.480
Okay.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.777
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

19:15.529 --> 19:17.071
That's okay.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.326
- What's going on?
- Um...

19:23.370 --> 19:26.914
- Well, um, okay, first of all...
- Mm-hm.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.001
...Paolo and I are not back together.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.961
That was a stupid thing I did.

19:32.129 --> 19:35.298
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

19:35.465 --> 19:37.633
...well, I wouldn't.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.760
- Ahem.
- Um...

19:39.928 --> 19:41.971
- Heh.
- Second of all...

19:42.764 --> 19:44.557
What?

19:44.975 --> 19:48.227
Before I say anything...

19:48.395 --> 19:51.230
...is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.857
Then I tell you what I think...

19:53.025 --> 19:55.443
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

19:55.611 --> 19:58.446
...and I look like a complete idiot?
- No, no, no.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.991
Okay. Um, well, then,
I think the guy's scum.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.621
I hate him. I mean, I actually...
I physically hate him.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.165
You know? I always have.

20:09.333 --> 20:13.336
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.755
- Really?
- Rach?

20:15.923 --> 20:18.549
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

20:18.717 --> 20:21.010
...and who gets how funny...

20:21.178 --> 20:23.679
...and sweet and amazing...

20:23.889 --> 20:26.974
...and adorable and sexy you are.

20:27.142 --> 20:30.770
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

20:31.021 --> 20:34.649
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!" Heh.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.735
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.071
Like the way I do with Julie.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.329
Was there a "second of all"?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.707
Um...

20:52.918 --> 20:57.129
No, um, I think that was the whole "all."

20:59.299 --> 21:00.967
I gotta go. Okay?

21:01.134 --> 21:03.636
- Okay.
- Thanks.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.846
Okay.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.187
No, I swear to God, Dad!

21:13.355 --> 21:15.481
That's not how they measure pants!

21:22.906 --> 21:26.492
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.536
- Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that.
- Really?

21:28.704 --> 21:31.247
- Yeah. You wanna do it now?
- Great!

21:31.415 --> 21:33.124
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.875
See you.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.586
Okay, I just wanna make
really sure this time.

21:37.754 --> 21:38.838
Uh-huh. Ahem.

21:39.006 --> 21:43.342
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

21:44.428 --> 21:45.469
No.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.392
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's Roddy McDowall.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.354
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.149
- Oh! Yeah, okay.
- Yeah. Okay?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.234
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
