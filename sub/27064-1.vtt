00:26.694 --> 00:29.027
I'm sorry,
can you say that again?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.063
Yes, the newest Gellar painting
will be on display

00:31.098 --> 00:33.065
at the gallery opening tonight.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.644
Right now we have
three interested buyers,

00:34.668 --> 00:37.502
but the seller hasn't
made a decision yet.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.172
Well, it's definitely
worth seeing in person.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.673
Look, if you wanna make an offer

00:41.709 --> 00:43.075
I can put in
a good word for you.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.010
Thank you.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.378
Okay, great, thanks.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.915
Okay, how's it going today?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.494
Great. The caterer's
setting up the tables

00:51.518 --> 00:52.762
and all the plaques
have been hung

00:52.786 --> 00:53.997
by their corresponding
paintings,

00:54.021 --> 00:56.054
- ready for your approval.
- Okay.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.769
Okay, the lighting on these
oil paintings is too harsh.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.461
We gotta move them to the front,
put a softer light on them.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.962
Good catch.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.064
And let's put up
a couple decorations,

01:06.100 --> 01:07.733
but tonight's really
about the exhibit.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.979
Next week, we can go all out
for the gallery Christmas party.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.169
- Great.
- Thanks, April.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.404
Thanks.

01:24.451 --> 01:27.386
I know that look.
What's wrong?

01:27.421 --> 01:30.655
- The frames on this wall clash.
- You're right.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.103
Let's try that in a gold frame.
I think that would look better.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.838
I don't know what I would do
without you, Heidi.

01:34.862 --> 01:38.430
This whole opening tonight
is thanks to you.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.599
I'm so glad you acquired
that Gellar collection.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.135
Just doing my job, boss.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.638
Pleasure doing business
with you too. Bye.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.140
Another successful sale?

01:48.175 --> 01:49.408
If all goes well, yeah.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.687
Julia's sending me
to get a salad.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.843
Did you want anything?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.211
No, I'm okay, thank you.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.480
Will you hand me
my vendor binder over there?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.849
I have to order another frame
ASAP for tonight.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.151
Sure.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.853
What's this?

02:01.889 --> 02:04.222
That's actually my portfolio.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.291
You're an artist?

02:06.326 --> 02:08.193
Yeah. That's originally
why I applied

02:08.228 --> 02:09.961
to be Julia's assistant.
Thanks.

02:09.997 --> 02:13.598
I just wanted to get my foot in
the door, have my work be seen.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.233
Do you mind if I take a look?

02:15.269 --> 02:16.334
Sure.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.473
Oh, my goodness.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.309
You're really good.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.777
Has Julia seen these?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.313
Briefly, yeah,
when I first started.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.682
- I love that one.
- That's awesome.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.529
She was more impressed
with my assistant skills,

02:32.553 --> 02:34.386
so painting,
I put on the back burner.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.855
I asked her the other day if she
wanted to take another look,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.089
and she said, "Soon,"

02:38.125 --> 02:39.469
but I think
she was just being nice.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.792
You should keep at it.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.395
Yeah, I want to.
I just have to find the time.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.365
This is Heidi.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.934
Hi, Mr. Collins.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.570
We loved your new prints.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.472
When can you come in?

03:01.281 --> 03:03.849
So I know this last unit
was pretty difficult,

03:03.884 --> 03:05.895
and a lot of you guys are
having trouble concentrating

03:05.919 --> 03:09.020
with Christmas break
coming around the corner,

03:09.056 --> 03:12.757
but... I know you guys
can do better,

03:12.793 --> 03:15.160
which is why, on Friday,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.295
I'm gonna let you guys
retake it.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.497
All right?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.131
Sound good?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.200
Have a good one, guys.
I'll see ya soon.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.005
Hey, Tom.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.407
Hey, can you hang back
for a sec?

03:30.511 --> 03:32.110
Is everything okay?

03:32.145 --> 03:35.080
You usually do a lot better
than that on the test.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.949
Yeah, just a lot of details
to memorize.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.485
Nothing's distracting you?

03:40.521 --> 03:41.786
No.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.854
Good, good,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.589
'cause as your hockey coach,

03:44.625 --> 03:46.035
I get to see firsthand
how well you do

03:46.059 --> 03:48.026
when you really dedicate
yourself to something.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.528
I will study more.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.963
Okay, well, let me know
if you need any help, all right?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.131
Thanks, Mr. Shepherd.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.799
Have a good one, Tom.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.505
Matt, please let Erica know that
I still have her slow cooker.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.974
I didn't forget. I will get it
back to her this weekend.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.442
Do you have a second?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.478
Yeah, yeah.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.914
I need to ask a favor.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.016
Oh, no.
That's the tone of voice you use

04:11.051 --> 04:12.951
when you want something
as a vice principal

04:12.986 --> 04:14.019
and not my best friend.

04:14.054 --> 04:14.986
What are you talking about?

04:15.022 --> 04:16.387
This is my normal voice.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.523
All right, fine.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.725
It's a bit of a good news,
bad news situation.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.127
Yeah?

04:22.162 --> 04:24.095
Good news, Nancy had her baby
a few weeks early.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.463
- That's wonderful.
- It is.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.499
And the bad news is?

04:27.534 --> 04:29.434
She was in charge
of the Snowball Dance,

04:29.469 --> 04:31.336
and I need somebody
to take over planning it.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.449
Are you really asking me to
take over the Christmas dance?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.040
Everybody else is busy.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.708
Hockey doesn't start
till next year,

04:36.743 --> 04:39.477
I figure who better
to plan the Snowball Dance

04:39.513 --> 04:42.280
than the guy who was
once crowned the Snowball King.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.215
That was forever ago.
Why don't you just do it?

04:44.251 --> 04:47.218
I have two-year-old twins, man.
You think I have any free time?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.431
What makes you think
I know anything about

04:48.455 --> 04:49.754
running a Christmas dance?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.790
Nancy left me all her plans,
all right?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.925
All you gotta do is
finish setting up the gym,

04:53.961 --> 04:55.994
confirm with the deejay,
that sort of thing.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.964
It's nothing major.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.600
Look, you'd be doing me,
the students,

05:01.635 --> 05:05.236
and most importantly,
Christmas itself a huge favor.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.616
Can I talk to my best friend
for a second

05:06.640 --> 05:08.540
- and not my vice principal?
- Shoot.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.553
You're not gonna believe what
my boss just asked me to do.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.579
Look, I'll get you a list of PTA
parents you can ask to volunteer

05:14.615 --> 05:16.815
if you need a hand.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.050
What do you say?

05:20.220 --> 05:21.953
- Fine.
- You're the best!

05:21.989 --> 05:23.855
Thank you.
I gotta get to a meeting.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.501
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much, Chris!

05:25.525 --> 05:27.025
You're welcome.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.568
- Hi. Thank you for coming.
- Hey.

05:36.603 --> 05:39.237
Heidi, I want you to meet
Mr. Gellar.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.839
Hi.
It's so nice to meet you.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.240
I'm a huge admirer of your work.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.944
Thank you.
This opening is incredible.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.113
Julia here says
that it's all thanks to you.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.115
Oh, well, I had a lot of help.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.951
Heidi here is my right-hand
woman at the gallery.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.386
She started off as my assistant,

05:54.421 --> 05:56.321
but within
just a couple of months,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.256
I saw her raw talent
for art dealing.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.058
She has a good eye
for what sells.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.860
That's because
Heidi is also a painter.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.362
- A really good one.
- Is that so?

06:04.398 --> 06:06.931
Yes, I used to paint,
and now I do this.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.134
Well, you've chosen
the right path.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.069
The gallery is wonderful.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.570
You should see
what she has in store

06:12.606 --> 06:14.217
for the gallery
Christmas party coming up.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.675
- You will be there, won't you?
- Without a doubt.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.043
- Great.
- Yeah.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.779
Is that Nick Jones by chance?

06:20.814 --> 06:23.248
Yes, it is.
You should absolutely meet him.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.017
- Come, I'll introduce you.
- Excuse us.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.764
Hope it's okay
that I said you're a painter.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.854
Yeah, of course.
I'm sure most people here

06:29.890 --> 06:32.590
have similar aspirations.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.759
Do you miss it?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.227
Yes, very much.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.964
But this is a good job,
and I'm lucky to have it.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.337
Hey, dinner's almost ready.
No snacking.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.840
Got an email
from Mr. Shepherd today.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.609
He says he needs volunteers
for the Snowball Dance.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.011
What, like chaperone?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.412
No, I wouldn't do that to you.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.614
Just to help decorate
and set it all up.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.384
- Cool.
- So you're going, right?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.352
Yeah, probably,
with like a group of friends.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.722
Mr. Shepherd also mentioned
you didn't do so great

07:03.757 --> 07:05.490
on your history test.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.994
Hey, dishes by hand tonight.
The dishwasher's broken.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.831
- So the test.
- It was super hard,

07:12.866 --> 07:14.899
and most of the people
in the class didn't do well.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.902
Okay, well, I'm glad
he's offering a makeup.

07:17.938 --> 07:22.440
This week I'm thinking less
hockey time, more study time.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.711
Hey, Katie,
how's pageant rehearsal going?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.246
Terrible.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.715
Why do I feel like
you're being overly dramatic?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.016
It is.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.692
You've been hoping
for this solo all year,

07:33.720 --> 07:34.819
and now you're not into it?

07:34.855 --> 07:36.121
It's a horrid song.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.289
There are a lot of lyrics
to remember.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.991
You're gonna do great.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.226
Great news.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.538
Close on the house
for the Scoffers?

07:42.562 --> 07:43.828
Oh, no, better.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.364
Guess which husband-and-wife
realtor duo

07:46.399 --> 07:48.733
just got asked to be
the keynote speakers

07:48.769 --> 07:51.536
at the National Realtor
Convention?

07:51.571 --> 07:53.538
Wait, what? Us?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.540
- That's amazing.
- I know!

07:55.575 --> 07:57.609
Maybe we can all make
a trip out of it next year.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.111
No, no, it's for
this year's convention.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.447
The speaker they had
dropped out last minute.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.883
We leave tomorrow.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.556
Sorry.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.625
- April, I have to take this.
- Okay, no worries.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.027
- Hey, Megan.
- Enjoying your evening?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.709
Megan, you know I love
those kids more than anything,

08:19.733 --> 08:21.432
but now is really
not a good time.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.168
<i>It's only for two nights.</i>

08:23.203 --> 08:25.236
I know, but I have
three sales in the works,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.305
and I'm really busy
trying to get ready

08:27.340 --> 08:28.640
for this gallery
Christmas party.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.842
Every agent, art dealer,
and artist in Manhattan

08:30.877 --> 08:32.477
<i>is gonna be there.</i>

08:32.511 --> 08:34.946
I don't get how you moving
to New York to be a painter

08:34.981 --> 08:37.816
turned into you being
a fancy party planner.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.650
Well, plans change.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.586
<i>So can they change this time</i>

08:41.621 --> 08:43.087
and help me and John out?

08:43.123 --> 08:46.024
Can't Mom and Dad
come back early?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.603
No, they don't dock
from their Italian cruise

08:47.627 --> 08:48.993
till the end of the week.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.228
<i>That's right.</i>

08:50.263 --> 08:51.896
Hey, Mom,
I can take care of Katie.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.965
Nice try, but I'm not
leaving my 15-year-old son

08:54.000 --> 08:55.633
<i>alone for two nights.</i>

08:55.669 --> 08:58.469
<i>- I babysit all the time.
- For a couple of hours.</i>

08:58.505 --> 09:00.805
- Overnight is different.
- Okay.

09:00.841 --> 09:04.475
Heidi, this is a huge
opportunity for John and me.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.345
I wouldn't be asking
if I didn't really need this.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.913
Okay, let me see what I can do.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.481
Thank you, thank you.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.183
You're the best sister
in the world.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.518
<i>- I know.
- I love you.</i>

09:13.553 --> 09:16.054
I love you too. Bye.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.455
Somebody just made an offer

09:17.490 --> 09:18.957
on four of the Gellar
still lifes.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.692
That's great.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.361
- Julia, do you have a second?
- Yeah.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.863
My sister and my brother-in-law,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.431
they have to leave town
unexpectedly

09:26.466 --> 09:29.133
and they need someone to watch
my niece and nephew.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.280
I was wondering if I could take
a couple days and help them out.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.904
You can't be serious.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.906
We have the Christmas party
to get ready for.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.674
You know how important that is.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.010
I know, but I can continue
to do the prep while I'm gone.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.411
Well, what about our clients?

09:40.447 --> 09:42.058
You have to follow up
on the Anderson sales,

09:42.082 --> 09:43.314
and the Clover buyer.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.583
I know, but I can
do it all remotely.

09:45.619 --> 09:49.320
Listen, she would not ask
if it wasn't really important.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.257
Okay, just promise me

09:52.292 --> 09:54.425
you'll be back in time
for the Christmas party.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.827
I promise.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.062
Where are you from again?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.331
Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.400
Sounds cozy.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.136
Thanks.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.477
- Aunt Heidi!
- Hi, Katie!

10:48.315 --> 10:51.883
Wait a minute. Who's this tall
guy wearing my nephew's clothes?

10:51.918 --> 10:54.452
Hi. So yeah, Mom said
it was totally fine

10:54.487 --> 10:56.232
if I threw a party
while you were here, so...

10:56.256 --> 10:58.323
- Oh, did she?
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.259
- Have you met your Mom?
- Well, it was worth a try.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.994
Hi. We have to head
to the airport,

11:03.029 --> 11:04.573
so I just wanted to give you
a quick rundown of everything.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.230
Okay, sure.

11:06.266 --> 11:10.535
So you have to make sure Katie
is at drop-off by 7:45 a.m.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.637
Tom has a makeup history test
on Friday,

11:12.672 --> 11:14.272
so he needs to be
studying for that.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.140
The fridge is fully stocked.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.576
I left out recipes
for all the meals.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.089
Here's a credit card
in case of emergency...

11:20.113 --> 11:22.547
- I will hold onto that for you.
- No, you won't.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.850
Also, Katie has a solo
in her school Christmas pageant,

11:25.885 --> 11:27.585
so she needs to be
practicing for that.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.988
Okay, there's emergency
numbers on the fridge...

11:30.023 --> 11:31.956
Megan, relax.
Breathe, okay?

11:31.992 --> 11:34.592
I got it. I can take care
of two kids for two days.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.294
Megan, honey,
we gotta get going.

11:36.329 --> 11:40.765
- Okay, I love you, bye.
- Bye, love you.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.167
Heidi, thanks again.
You're a lifesaver.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.168
Yeah, you got it.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.104
Oh, and I volunteered to help

11:46.139 --> 11:47.638
on the Snowball Dance committee,

11:47.674 --> 11:49.518
so you need to meet
at the high school gym tonight

11:49.542 --> 11:50.542
at 8:00 p.m.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.709
- Megan...
- Don't be late.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.710
That wasn't part of the plan.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.013
Tom, no teasing your sister!

11:56.016 --> 11:57.548
So do you think
we should tell her

11:57.584 --> 11:59.717
that committee's being
run by Chris Shepherd?

11:59.753 --> 12:02.320
I didn't want her to get upset.
They're both adults.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.456
Might do them both good
to see each other again.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.758
Ready?

12:06.793 --> 12:07.925
Ready.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.629
I feel like it's been forever.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.897
What do you mean?

12:12.932 --> 12:14.343
You guys came to the city
for Easter.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.667
No, I mean since
you've been here.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.870
No, I was here
for Christmas last year.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.005
No, you weren't.
You had to work.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.608
Yeah, that's right.
Year before, then.

12:23.643 --> 12:27.111
I'd come home more often if
I could. I hope you know that.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.215
You still have that up.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.184
Of course.
It's my favorite.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.620
My friends come over,
and they ask about it.

12:35.655 --> 12:39.090
I tell them my super artsy aunt
painted it.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.725
You should make one for Katie.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.327
Yeah, it's on my to-do list,
for sure.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.596
If I ever have time,
I definitely will.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.040
Hey, Katie,
do you want any more pizza!

12:56.076 --> 12:58.342
She's probably got
her headphones on.

12:58.378 --> 13:02.146
Did you know that pizza actually
has all the food groups?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.048
Your mom would be
very proud of me.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.594
Does that mean we get to
eat it tomorrow too?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.785
Yeah.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.988
It is 8:00.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.490
Okay, great.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.326
Shouldn't you be at the
Snowball Dance committee thing?

13:15.361 --> 13:18.930
Yeah. How does your mom
make dinner, go to PTA meetings,

13:18.965 --> 13:21.666
and run a realty company
all at the same time?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.501
Are you gonna be okay
for a few hours?

13:23.536 --> 13:26.471
Yeah. We're just throwing
a party while you're gone.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.439
Very funny.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.707
Call me if you need me.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.609
All right, bye.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.917
Hi.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.487
Hey, sorry,
did I miss the meeting?

13:42.522 --> 13:46.023
No, you're actually
the first one to show up.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.062
- Heidi?
- Chris?

13:51.097 --> 13:55.433
What are you doing here?

13:55.468 --> 13:58.236
I'm watching the kids for Megan.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.806
She said she volunteered for...
What are you doing here?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.675
I work here?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.511
That's right.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.646
Yeah, Tom mentioned
that he had you for history.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.647
And hockey.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.016
You're the hockey coach too.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.720
- I know that look.
- What look?

14:15.755 --> 14:18.055
The "Chris is a teacher
and hockey coach

14:18.091 --> 14:19.657
at our old high school" look.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.025
Well, clearly you're projecting

14:21.060 --> 14:22.960
'cause in no way
am I giving that look.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.240
I know you better
than you think.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.330
Well, we were together
a long time ago.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.402
So you're planning the Snowball.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.705
Yeah, yeah, not by choice.
Matt kinda just insisted.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.943
I still can't believe that
Matt Sampson is vice principal.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.179
- Hey, how's Erica?
- She's good.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.748
She has her hands full
with the twins and the store.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.361
Who would've thought
that all those years ago

14:45.385 --> 14:47.885
that those two would be
married with twins?

14:47.921 --> 14:52.023
And that a high school
relationship would work out.

14:57.096 --> 15:00.831
So, how many people
are you expecting?

15:00.867 --> 15:05.436
Pretty sure
you're looking at it.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.772
Yeah.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.007
Okay, what can I do?

15:10.043 --> 15:12.944
Are you serious?
You actually wanna help?

15:12.979 --> 15:15.746
Yeah. I work for
an art gallery in New York.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.449
90% of what I do there is just
helping my boss plan parties.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.451
And plus I told Megan
that I would help her out.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.587
Wait, you don't paint?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.989
Well, I'm in that world, but no.

15:25.024 --> 15:28.693
I found more success buying
and selling art at the gallery.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.761
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

15:30.797 --> 15:33.108
I thought you went to New York
so you could become an artist.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.733
Well, sometimes things don't
work out the way you hope.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.809
So, yeah, I was going through
everything that they left.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.110
It's not great.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.712
Ooh, yikes.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.248
I was gonna lay it all out and
see what we had to work with.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.783
I think some decorations are
actually from our Snowball,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.385
maybe a couple decades
before that.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.687
Probably just throw
that one out, actually.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.090
No, I can fix it.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.093
Okay, what is that look for?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.628
I'm just surprised...

16:03.663 --> 16:05.341
that you actually want to
put the work into something,

16:05.365 --> 16:08.899
instead of buy something new,
move on.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.301
Why do I suddenly feel like

16:10.336 --> 16:12.136
you're not talking
about the snowflake?

16:12.171 --> 16:13.449
What else would I
be talking about?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.672
Nothing.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.608
You know what?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.011
I'm sure you'd rather spend time
with your niece and nephew.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.213
I got this.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.450
Fine by me.
This wasn't exactly on my list

16:26.486 --> 16:27.952
of things I wanted
to do tonight.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.420
Well, be my guest.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.389
Okay.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.401
Hey, come on, guys,
we're already behind schedule.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.810
Hey, I made breakfast.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.845
Well, I set out breakfast.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.414
Mom usually makes us eggs.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.481
And bacon.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.916
And sometimes pancakes.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.519
And Dad sometimes
makes us smoothies.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.924
This looks great too.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.559
Good, okay.

17:08.594 --> 17:11.295
You know what?
I gotta take this.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.698
Heidi, where did you put
the Edison sales slips?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.000
It's all digital now,
so it's in our "G" folder

17:16.035 --> 17:17.468
<i>under "transactions".</i>

17:17.502 --> 17:18.881
Thank goodness.
I thought they were gone.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.338
Okay, when you get a chance,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.373
<i>can you please email
the Parks Gallery?</i>

17:22.407 --> 17:23.685
They wanna know
if we're interested

17:23.710 --> 17:25.409
in participating
in the Art Walk.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.912
I told them you would know our
schedule better than I would.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.458
Well, April has access
to the calendar.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.126
I would just feel better
if you would take care of it.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.150
Of course, no problem.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.354
And did Robert text you about
the catering for the party?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.955
Yes. I'm gonna respond
right now.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.125
Okay, well, I guess that's it.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.005
Okay, well, let me know
if you need anything else.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.495
I will.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.796
Great, bye.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.667
Robert.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.536
Okay, ready?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.873
Here, put this on.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.075
That sounds good.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.344
Oh, shoot, almost forgot.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.885
Let's go.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.259
Okay.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.394
Hey, remember,

18:16.429 --> 18:18.273
no hockey tonight 'cause
you have to study for that test.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.664
But some guys are going to the
rink to practice for tryouts.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.933
I know. It's not me.
It's your mom. Sorry.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.203
All right, fine.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.371
Bye! Love you!

18:27.407 --> 18:28.839
Love you too.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.543
Hey.

18:32.578 --> 18:35.780
Hey, who's that girl
Tom just said hi to?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.915
I don't know.
Usually Mom drops me off first.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.150
You get dropped off first?

18:39.185 --> 18:41.085
Yeah, otherwise I'm late.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.453
Shoot.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.796
- Aunt Heidi!
- Right, sorry.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.800
Chris!

18:55.835 --> 18:57.468
How'd the meeting go?

18:57.503 --> 18:58.969
One person showed up.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.315
Wanna know who
that one person was?

19:00.339 --> 19:02.072
- Santa?
- Heidi Nelson.

19:02.108 --> 19:05.209
She's out here watching her
niece and nephew for a few days.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.178
- Well, how'd it go?
- Not great.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.014
- Did you talk to her?
- Yeah, yeah, about the dance.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.827
Okay, so not about the fact
that she broke your heart,

19:11.851 --> 19:13.384
and you've never
been the same since.

19:13.419 --> 19:16.387
Seeing how that's not the case,
no, it did not come up.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.721
Good.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.190
That's good.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.830
Just make sure the florist
is there by 4:00,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.265
so she has time to set up.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.134
Okay, thanks, Robert.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.302
Bye.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.306
Heidi?

19:35.341 --> 19:38.576
- Erica, hey!
- Hi!

19:38.611 --> 19:40.077
I didn't know you were in town.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.746
Yeah, I'm watching
Tom and Katie,

19:42.782 --> 19:44.793
I'm only here till tomorrow,
otherwise I would've called you.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.551
I get it. Taking care of kids
is time consuming.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.919
Hey, guys.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.395
I've seen pictures of you
on Integra,

19:50.423 --> 19:51.889
but you're much cuter in person.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.024
Michael, James,
this is Mommy's friend, Heidi.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.061
- Can you say hi?
- They're so cute.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.774
- How are Tom and Katie?
- They're good.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.830
Growing up too fast.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.532
Is Tom going to the Snowball?

20:01.567 --> 20:04.268
I don't know. We haven't
talked about it. I hope so.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.738
Well, Matt has us down
to chaperone.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.084
He tried to make it sound
like it would be

20:09.108 --> 20:10.741
this fun romantic night out,

20:10.776 --> 20:12.510
and I told him he had
to just say the words,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.745
we'll get a babysitter,
and I was there.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.614
Megan signed up
to help plan the dance,

20:16.649 --> 20:18.182
so I went in her place
last night.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.416
Nobody really showed up.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.052
It was just me
and Chris Shepherd.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.187
Yeah.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.822
How was that?

20:24.857 --> 20:27.558
He had it mostly under control,
so I didn't really do much.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.060
No, I mean, how was it
seeing him again?

20:30.096 --> 20:31.562
I know it's been awhile.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.564
Yeah, it was fine.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.800
- It was weird.
- Good weird?

20:36.836 --> 20:39.069
He didn't really seem
very happy to see me.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.116
I'm sure he's just overwhelmed
with the dance stuff.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.807
I know Matt sort of
sprung it on him last minute.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.677
- I'm glad he had you to help.
- Yeah, kind of.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.813
Did you know he had a book
published last year?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.015
Chris has a book?

20:51.050 --> 20:53.317
Yeah, something about
Mark Twain.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.653
Good for him.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.289
- Your usual.
- Thank you so much.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.491
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, it was great to see you.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.603
It was so great to see you.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.727
- Okay, bye, guys.
- Bye.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.718
<i>Make sure to check
the modified finals schedule.</i>

21:16.742 --> 21:19.209
<i>We're looking forward
to seeing you at the Snowball.</i>

21:19.245 --> 21:21.245
<i>You can still get tickets
at the student store.</i>

21:21.280 --> 21:23.147
<i>Have a great day.</i>

21:23.182 --> 21:25.416
Hey, shouldn't somebody
be spotting you?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.519
I like to live life on the edge.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.722
Were you...
What are you doing here?

21:31.757 --> 21:34.592
I just felt bad about the way
we ended things last night.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.061
And Megan signed up
to help out with this,

21:37.096 --> 21:39.363
and I should fill in
and help out in her place.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.798
It's really okay.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.544
Actually, I had some ideas
for some decorations.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.234
Do you remember our Snowball?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.248
We had those icicles
that came down from the ceiling?

21:46.272 --> 21:48.483
Icicles aren't exactly the
first things that come to mind

21:48.507 --> 21:50.140
when I think about
that night, no.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.176
Well, I just thought
it'd be a cool effect to have.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.677
I can help you make some
if you want.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.878
You don't have to.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.114
I'm sure you have
a lot going on.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.683
What?

21:59.719 --> 22:02.152
Nothing. I thought I felt
a drip on my face.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.722
Well, actually, I was thinking
with this Styrofoam,

22:04.757 --> 22:06.457
with a little paint
and a little shading,

22:06.492 --> 22:07.825
I think it'll look great.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.529
- Ooh.
- Hey, careful, careful!

22:12.565 --> 22:14.164
There you go.
It's coming down now.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.333
Yeah, it's just water.

22:16.369 --> 22:21.238
The bright side is we might have
real icicles for decorations.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.873
Yeah, so I guess
after they left,

22:22.908 --> 22:24.708
the roof sprung a major leak.

22:24.744 --> 22:25.709
If they can't fix
the roof in time,

22:25.745 --> 22:26.977
is the Snowball canceled?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.646
I don't know.
I hope not.

22:28.681 --> 22:32.116
I'm sure Vice Principal Sampson
will figure something out.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.822
Did you use the dishwasher?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.024
Yes.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.459
It's, broken.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.029
You don't say.

22:50.736 --> 22:52.970
Hey, Tom, are these
all the towels you have?

22:53.005 --> 22:55.072
There might be some
in the closet under the stairs.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.206
Okay.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.276
Right there.

23:00.846 --> 23:02.913
Hey, what's my old easel
doing in here?

23:02.948 --> 23:04.415
I don't know.
Grandma and Grandpa

23:04.450 --> 23:06.717
brought over a bunch of stuff.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.755
Yeah.
These are my old yearbooks.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.625
You should paint something.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.960
Yeah, maybe later.
The kitchen floor's still wet.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.562
I don't wanna warp the floors.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.498
Hey. That doesn't look
like studying.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.867
It is, just not
history class studying.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.335
Do you want some help?

23:58.370 --> 23:59.703
Are you good at history?

23:59.739 --> 24:02.239
No. Actually, Mr. Shepherd
is the one

24:02.274 --> 24:03.852
that helped me get through
all my history classes

24:03.876 --> 24:05.454
- in high school.
- Yeah, that's right.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.944
Mom told me
you guys used to date.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.412
We did.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.880
You guys were so popular.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.515
Weren't you guys
Snowball King and Queen?

24:11.550 --> 24:13.450
Yeah. That means
I'm actual royalty,

24:13.486 --> 24:15.786
so you have to listen to me,
and you have to study.

24:15.821 --> 24:16.754
I know.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.455
Mr. Shepherd's the best.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.257
Mom said if I get
straight A's this semester

24:20.292 --> 24:21.759
I can get my driver's permit.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.594
Cool. What's the problem?

24:23.629 --> 24:25.796
I don't know.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.065
There's a girl.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.801
How'd you know?

24:30.836 --> 24:33.303
Because I fell victim
to those symptoms too.

24:33.339 --> 24:36.073
You can't focus, you can't
concentrate on anything.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.208
You think about them
all the time.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.578
Yeah, that sums it up.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.647
Well, why don't you ask her
to the Snowball Dance?

24:43.682 --> 24:45.649
No. No, she'd say no.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.152
And I think she's into
this other guy named Ryan.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.120
He's way too popular.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.390
So? How can you be sure
unless you try?

24:55.060 --> 24:57.528
Okay, don't stay up too late.

24:57.563 --> 24:58.495
I won't.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.531
And do your homework.

24:59.565 --> 25:01.298
All right.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.408
They put our talk up
on housebuy.com.

26:18.444 --> 26:19.910
Cool.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.713
"Realtor husband-and-wife
dazzle at convention".

26:25.651 --> 26:27.217
Howdy.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.220
Hope you folks aren't planning
on flying anywhere today.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.288
Why do you say that?

26:31.323 --> 26:33.056
Airport-wide computer outage.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.225
All flights are grounded.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.008
What do you mean,
you're not coming home today?

26:40.032 --> 26:42.833
I'm supposed to be back at work.
My boss is gonna freak out.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.868
<i>I'm really sorry.
All flights are grounded.</i>

26:44.904 --> 26:48.005
<i>They have no idea when things
will be up and running again.</i>

26:48.040 --> 26:49.506
Okay, what are you gonna do?

26:49.541 --> 26:51.475
Well, we don't wanna
risk the wait,

26:51.510 --> 26:53.243
so we're just gonna
keep the rental car

26:53.279 --> 26:54.912
and try and fly out of Atlanta.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.281
- Okay.
- Wait.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.216
So will you be home
in time for the pageant?

26:59.251 --> 27:00.417
Of course.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.730
Hopefully we'll be back
tomorrow.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.387
Sweet. More time
with Aunt Heidi.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.456
<i>I miss you too, Tom.
And, Heidi,</i>

27:06.492 --> 27:08.870
<i>since I won't be back in time,
you have to bake some cookies</i>

27:08.894 --> 27:11.206
<i>to take to the Christmas cookie
sale at Katie's school today.</i>

27:11.230 --> 27:13.096
Meg, you know I don't bake.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.033
We have all the ingredients.
I'll text you an easy recipe.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.201
It'll be great.
Tom and Katie can help.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.736
Okay.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.142
How many ounces in a cup?

27:25.177 --> 27:28.045
I don't know.
Just look it up.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.615
- I...
- Okay, just guesstimate then.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.750
Katie, how are those
dry ingredients coming?

27:33.786 --> 27:35.185
What do you mean by dry?

27:35.220 --> 27:37.154
Okay, well, it all goes
in the oven, right?

27:37.189 --> 27:38.722
So how hard can it be?

27:41.894 --> 27:43.160
Okay.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.796
That's the first batch.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.198
That does not look like snowmen.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.335
Well, that's 'cause
we haven't frosted it yet.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.311
Okay, that grocery store
down the street,

28:01.347 --> 28:02.980
it has a bakery, right?

28:05.117 --> 28:06.483
Thank you.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.786
Look! The cookies we brought
are almost all gone.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.388
Yeah, I know.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.168
I just feel bad we wasted
all your mom's ingredients.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.225
- I'll still eat those.
- Really?

28:15.260 --> 28:16.838
Yeah, they're still sugar,
flour, and frosting.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.195
That's true.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.931
Hey, I think that's your cue.

28:20.966 --> 28:22.299
Okay.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.668
These aren't doing so hot.
Those are gross.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.970
Can I skip school today?

28:27.006 --> 28:29.373
Is this about your mom?

28:29.408 --> 28:30.974
You know they're
gonna be back soon,

28:31.010 --> 28:32.676
and I'm gonna stay
until they get here.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.944
That's not it.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.345
Okay, then what's wrong?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.581
I don't wanna go
to pageant rehearsal today.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.227
You know
you're a great singer, Katie.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.584
Thanks.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.263
Is there something
specifically about the solo

28:42.287 --> 28:43.327
that you're worried about?

28:43.355 --> 28:44.554
No, never mind.

28:44.590 --> 28:45.689
I should go.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.759
She'll be okay.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.127
I hope so.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.696
If your mom was here,
she'd know what to say.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.471
- See you after school.
- Bye. Have a good day.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.206
We just pull up the floor

29:03.242 --> 29:06.543
and pull out the damaged ceiling
tiles, and we're good.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.425
Let's get this stuff
out of the way,

29:10.449 --> 29:12.082
so we can bring in
the man-lift, okay?

29:12.117 --> 29:15.085
- This is going in the Dumpster?
- Let's get it moving.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.987
Heidi, I heard you were in town.

29:17.022 --> 29:19.222
Hey, Matty Sampson.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.824
It's been too long.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.526
I thought you were
leaving town today.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.694
Yeah, actually,
Megan and John got stuck,

29:24.730 --> 29:26.596
so I'm here
for a little bit longer.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.166
So what's the verdict?

29:29.201 --> 29:31.279
There's no way it's gonna be
repaired in time for the dance.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.236
And most of the decorations
have been destroyed.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.539
So it's a good thing

29:35.574 --> 29:37.974
that I have the best
Snowball planning-team ever.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.477
Surely you guys can figure out
a new location

29:40.512 --> 29:44.281
and find some new decorations
as quickly as possible, right?

29:44.316 --> 29:45.982
We may actually have
to just cancel.

29:46.018 --> 29:46.950
Yeah.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.019
The Snowball? Guys, come on.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.620
You know how special
this dance is.

29:50.656 --> 29:54.024
No way we can cancel.
You'll think of something.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.359
I gotta get back to it.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.196
Heidi, it was lovely to see you.
You look the exact same.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.163
So do you.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.365
I'm sure I do.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.670
I think it might be me.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.545
I think I'm jinxed
because after this happened,

30:08.574 --> 30:10.085
I went home,
and the dishwasher was broken,

30:10.109 --> 30:11.575
and the whole kitchen
was flooded.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.110
So this is all your fault?

30:13.145 --> 30:14.644
Yeah.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.414
Are we gonna be able to find
another location for the dance?

30:17.449 --> 30:18.648
I don't know.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.750
I do have to get
to class, though,

30:20.786 --> 30:22.252
but I have a free period later.

30:22.287 --> 30:24.688
If you wanna maybe meet up
at Frank's,

30:24.723 --> 30:27.858
let's say 2:00,
brainstorm some new locations...

30:27.893 --> 30:29.392
Frank's. Okay, sure.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.461
Okay, I will see you then.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.396
Yeah. Bye.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.668
<i>Just make sure you include</i>

30:38.704 --> 30:40.237
<i>the account number
on the invoice.</i>

30:40.272 --> 30:41.916
There's so much to get done
before the party.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.840
I can't believe you're
not gonna be back today.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.942
I know, but you're
doing a great job.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.277
Thank you so much
for filling in.

30:47.312 --> 30:48.778
I'll be back as soon as I can.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.481
Julia just got back.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.817
Is that Heidi?

30:55.254 --> 30:57.454
Heidi, where were
we meant to display

30:57.489 --> 30:59.022
<i>the Kensington's collection?</i>

30:59.057 --> 31:01.691
Over by the far wall,
next to the newer watercolors.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.426
What time are you
coming in today?

31:03.462 --> 31:05.195
<i>Actually, that's kind
of why I'm calling.</i>

31:05.230 --> 31:08.098
My sister and brother-in-law,
they got stuck.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.844
<i>It's kind of up in the air
when they're gonna be back.</i>

31:09.868 --> 31:12.702
Heidi, you said it was
only gonna be for two days.

31:12.738 --> 31:13.870
I need you here.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.539
Do you know how much
has to get done

31:15.574 --> 31:17.152
<i>- before the Christmas party?
- Yes, of course.</i>

31:17.176 --> 31:18.775
I'm gonna do as much
as I can from here,

31:18.810 --> 31:21.311
<i>and April can fill in
until I'm back.</i>

31:21.346 --> 31:25.015
Okay, but you will be back
in time for the party, correct?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.950
Yes, of course.
I'll definitely be there.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.696
<i>Good, because you know
how much I depend on you</i>

31:28.720 --> 31:29.986
at these things.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.288
I know.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.723
Okay, well, I guess
I'll see you then.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.792
Okay, bye.

32:20.305 --> 32:22.339
So there's no way
we can reserve the space?

32:22.374 --> 32:24.541
I know it's
short notice and all.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.945
I understand. No, I understand.
Thank you very much.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.780
All right, bye-bye.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.616
So there's nothing available.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.251
That's the fifth place
we've tried.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.554
There has to be a place
we're not thinking of.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.022
What?

32:39.057 --> 32:40.735
Nothing, just why don't you
pour the coffee in there

32:40.759 --> 32:42.125
and drink that?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.194
Fine. I'm not very good
at adulting, all right?

32:44.229 --> 32:45.795
I wouldn't say that.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.475
I think you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.833
Well, I'm no big-city
art dealer.

32:49.868 --> 32:53.003
I looked up your art gallery.
It's actually...

32:53.038 --> 32:55.071
It's pretty impressive.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.374
Trust me, what I do there
isn't that impressive.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.376
Then why'd you quit painting?

32:59.411 --> 33:00.944
Job got in the way.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.512
Money was good.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.225
It's a lot easier
judging other people's work

33:04.249 --> 33:06.383
than having people judge mine.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.052
I miss it though.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.087
Then you should paint.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.690
You always were the most
talented person I ever met.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.661
You know, I found my easel
at Megan's.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.130
It's like seeing an old friend.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.831
It's kind of like this.

33:21.867 --> 33:24.634
Yeah, except the easel
didn't hate me.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.170
I can never hate you, Heidi.

33:27.205 --> 33:31.107
You know, why don't you paint
something for the Snowball, huh?

33:31.143 --> 33:33.109
Why don't we find a venue first?

33:33.145 --> 33:36.012
Right.
Location would be good.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.648
One other place I can think of

33:38.684 --> 33:40.250
is that new country club,

33:40.285 --> 33:42.819
but I think their rental fee
would be out of our budget.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.421
What about that hotel on Dunbar?

33:44.456 --> 33:45.989
Is that still there?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.402
It's kind of a drive,
but it might be something.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.826
You really wanna do
our school dance

33:48.860 --> 33:51.027
at a stale
hotel conference there?

33:51.063 --> 33:52.762
Do you have a better idea?

33:52.798 --> 33:56.132
I do not.
I will look them up.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.834
Call 'em.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.972
Hey, hello.
How's it going?

34:03.008 --> 34:04.552
I'm a teacher
over at Lincoln High School,

34:04.576 --> 34:07.177
and we're looking
for a last-minute location

34:07.212 --> 34:11.514
for our school dance
on the 23rd.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.315
No, yeah, that would work.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.485
Can we maybe come by
and see the space?

34:15.520 --> 34:18.021
I don't know.
Maybe 20 minutes?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.857
- Sure.
- Thank you.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.324
Stale hotel it is.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.731
Hey, why didn't you tell me

34:27.766 --> 34:29.299
you had a history book
published?

34:29.333 --> 34:30.967
Never came up.

34:31.002 --> 34:32.780
It's not like you call
every time you're in town.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.371
Well, I'm not in town
very often.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.906
When I am,
it's only for a couple days.

34:36.942 --> 34:39.074
But for what it's worth,
I'm really impressed.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.577
Thank you.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.523
It's a far cry from the jock
you knew in high school

34:42.547 --> 34:43.746
who was holding you back.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.159
Holding me back?
I never thought that.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.783
Didn't you?

34:46.818 --> 34:49.152
You had all these big plans,
and I wasn't part of them.

34:49.187 --> 34:51.087
- That's why we broke up.
- No, we broke up

34:51.123 --> 34:52.867
because you went off
to college to play hockey,

34:52.891 --> 34:54.369
and I wanted to be an artist
in New York,

34:54.393 --> 34:56.137
and it just didn't make sense
to stay together.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.827
We could have tried though.

34:59.064 --> 35:00.530
Either way, it worked out.

35:00.565 --> 35:02.732
My dreams of becoming
a professional hockey player

35:02.768 --> 35:04.334
went out the window
when I hurt my knee,

35:04.369 --> 35:07.771
and I found everything
I wanted in Pleasant Valley.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.205
You did the same in New York.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.074
I should've called
when you hurt your knee,

35:11.109 --> 35:14.544
but we hadn't spoken
since we broke up and...

35:14.579 --> 35:16.713
I'm sorry.
That must've been really hard.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.882
It was.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.818
But being home helped.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.998
And I was planning on moving
back to Pleasant Valley anyways.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.289
It just happened a lot sooner
than I thought it would.

35:26.324 --> 35:28.658
Yeah, looks like
both of our dreams

35:28.693 --> 35:30.538
didn't really work out
the way we thought they would.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.729
But yours still could.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.864
But please never stop
painting, Heidi.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.534
That's the reason
I fell in love with you.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.069
- Really?
- Yup.

35:40.105 --> 35:43.339
It was freshman year art class.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.542
You painted that
beautiful picture of...

35:45.577 --> 35:47.177
Main Street.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.447
I saw that,
and I just got inspired.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.415
You know, you did that.

35:52.451 --> 35:55.151
You made something from nothing.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.921
Obviously that's not
the only reason

35:57.956 --> 35:59.756
I fell in love with you.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.992
You're smart, you're funny,

36:03.028 --> 36:06.129
you're like the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.033
- Oh, shoot.
- What?

36:10.068 --> 36:12.902
It's this gauge.
It says it's full when it's not.

36:12.938 --> 36:16.005
That's the problem
with these old cars.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.174
- Pull over.
- All right.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.431
- You have a signal?
- No.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.267
Wait a minute.

36:44.302 --> 36:45.902
Hey, do you realize
where we are?

36:45.937 --> 36:47.337
Yeah, not near a gas station.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.340
No, that's Glenn Farms.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.041
That's where we had
our first date.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.177
- We fed the baby goats.
- Yeah.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.890
Glenn sold the place
a couple of years ago.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.014
Nice old couple bought it
and renovated it.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.016
It's a B&B now.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.251
- Cool.
- Yeah.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.419
Let's go use their phone.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.468
Hello!

37:20.005 --> 37:21.771
Hello. Can I help ya?

37:21.806 --> 37:24.541
I'm Heidi. This is Chris.
Our car ran out of gas.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.709
We were just curious
if we could borrow your phone.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.712
I'll do you one better.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.415
I got some gasoline in the barn.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.484
It's enough to get you
back into town.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.119
That would be great.
Thank you.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.996
Oh, wow.
This place is beautiful.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.798
I don't remember it
looking this good.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.801
Well, my wife and I
bought it a while back,

37:51.836 --> 37:54.537
and we converted the house
up the road into a B&B,

37:54.573 --> 37:57.473
and now I'm working
to renovate this place

37:57.509 --> 37:59.609
into an event space.

37:59.644 --> 38:02.312
You rent the barn for events?

38:02.347 --> 38:03.880
Well, that's the goal.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.915
Still haven't finished
renovating it yet.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.450
No, it's perfect.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.419
Well, thank you.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.588
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

38:11.623 --> 38:12.855
I think I am.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.757
Do you have any availability
on Monday?

38:14.793 --> 38:17.794
Yeah, but like I said,

38:17.829 --> 38:19.963
the place is not ready
for guests yet.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.598
You wanna rent it this spring?

38:21.633 --> 38:24.734
Actually, we need it for
a high school Christmas dance.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.380
We're in desperate need
of a new location.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.605
Well...

38:28.640 --> 38:31.674
I don't think I can have
the barn ready that fast.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.242
We don't care.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.812
We can do everything needed,
and it's good as-is.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.516
Well, I'll give you...

38:40.552 --> 38:43.453
I'll give it to you
half-off the going rate

38:43.488 --> 38:44.787
'cause it isn't finished.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.456
That is so nice of you.
Thank you.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.926
Thank you.
This is gonna be great.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.600
- The place was amazing.
- Yeah.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.703
The kids are gonna love it.
How sweet is Roy?

39:02.273 --> 39:03.773
You know what I was thinking?

39:03.808 --> 39:05.475
Maybe we could rent some horses

39:05.510 --> 39:07.543
and some sleighs
for the outside.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.746
I'm not quite sure
that's in our budget, Heidi.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.214
Well, the good news is

39:11.249 --> 39:12.760
that farm's only
a few miles outside of town,

39:12.784 --> 39:14.328
and all we have to do
is decorate the barn

39:14.352 --> 39:16.853
since the rest of that place
screams Christmas.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.287
It was like
stepping into a dream.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.690
- Didn't you feel that way?
- I did.

39:20.725 --> 39:22.659
And I already have
the perfect theme.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.394
All right, lay it on me.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.262
"Christmas Wonderland".

39:26.297 --> 39:28.431
Hey, that's perfect.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.733
Hey, did you see that
wood panel inside the barn?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.413
I was thinking we could
use it to decorate.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.971
You could paint a mural, and
we can hang it above the stairs.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.446
I'm sure Roy
has a better use for it.

39:36.474 --> 39:37.807
We could ask.

39:37.842 --> 39:40.576
It looked like it was
in a scrap pile to me.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.746
I was thinking something
"Wonderland Snowball" themed.

39:43.782 --> 39:47.183
You know, a personal touch
from a past snow queen.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.852
I'll think about it.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.060
Hey, these stocking
are really cool.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.562
That school's really
upped their crafts.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.667
You're kinda quiet tonight.
How did rehearsal go?

40:04.703 --> 40:06.536
Fine, I guess.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.505
You wanna talk about it?

40:09.541 --> 40:12.241
I'm gonna forget all those words
in front of all those people.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.777
What do you mean?
You've been rehearsing all week.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.714
But it's a hard song.
There's a lot to memorize.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.615
You know, I used to get
really nervous

40:19.651 --> 40:21.384
every time I showed
my paintings to people.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.186
So what did you do?

40:23.221 --> 40:26.189
Well, I guess
I just realized that...

40:26.224 --> 40:29.092
I really liked them,
and I was really proud of them,

40:29.127 --> 40:31.594
and that's kind of
all that mattered.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.297
Hey, would it help
if we went over it together?

40:34.332 --> 40:35.832
Yes.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.066
Maybe.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.434
Okay.

40:47.912 --> 40:49.779
Hey, you didn't need to call
Mr. Shepherd over.

40:49.814 --> 40:50.947
I'm studying.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.950
I didn't call Mr. Shepherd!

40:59.491 --> 41:02.425
- Hey. Chris.
- Hey.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.794
- What are you doing here?
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

41:04.829 --> 41:08.331
I remembered that you mentioned
the dishwasher was broken,

41:08.366 --> 41:10.433
and my dad used to be
a plumber, so...

41:10.468 --> 41:12.135
I thought I'd come
take a look for you.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.704
Actually, that would be great.
Thanks. Come on in.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.639
- You sure?
- Yeah.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.542
Something smells good.

41:19.577 --> 41:21.477
Yeah, it's takeout Thai food.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.845
They got tired of pizza.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.680
- Hey, Mr. Shepherd.
- Hey, Tom, how are you?

41:24.716 --> 41:26.983
I'm just studying
for the makeup tomorrow.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.851
- I like seeing that.
- Yeah.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.487
When was
the Missouri Compromise?

41:31.523 --> 41:34.090
We are not cheating.

41:34.125 --> 41:38.294
1822?

41:38.329 --> 41:39.862
Close. 1820.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.298
That is what I meant.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.333
Dishwasher?

41:43.368 --> 41:45.234
Yeah, fix away.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.470
I don't really know
what's wrong with it.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.539
Katie and I
are gonna go rehearse

41:49.574 --> 41:51.841
her solo
in the Christmas pageant.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.776
Let me guess,
"Herald Angel?"

41:53.812 --> 41:56.045
Yeah, and I'm not good at it.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.780
Please, I doubt that.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.483
You know, I had the same exact
solo when I was in 4th grade?

42:00.518 --> 42:02.652
- I remember that.
- Do you?

42:02.687 --> 42:04.320
They still making you do
all the verses?

42:04.355 --> 42:07.056
- Yup!
- That is a tough one.

42:07.091 --> 42:12.395
Yeah, but Aunt Heidi was going
to go over the words with me.

42:12.430 --> 42:13.596
Was she?

42:13.631 --> 42:14.797
Yeah.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.233
I think that is a great idea.

42:17.268 --> 42:20.069
Let's go sing.

42:20.104 --> 42:21.737
Have fun.

42:23.374 --> 42:27.410
All right, who was
James Monroe's Vice President?

42:27.445 --> 42:28.678
Tompkins.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.646
- That's right.
- I remember that one

42:30.682 --> 42:32.782
because the first three letters
are my name.

42:32.817 --> 42:35.017
Smart. Now if only
all the other vice presidents

42:35.053 --> 42:38.120
had the name "Tom,"
you would be unbeatable.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.690
All right.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.758
I think we're...
I think we're all fixed.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.427
Okay, great.

42:44.462 --> 42:46.229
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.397
How am I supposed to remember,

42:48.433 --> 42:49.999
"All ye nations, rise.

42:50.034 --> 42:52.235
Join the triumph of the skies

42:52.270 --> 42:54.136
with angelic host proclaim"?

42:54.172 --> 42:55.972
It makes no sense to me.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.641
It's okay.
It doesn't have to make sense.

42:58.676 --> 43:01.510
Just find a rhythm and a flow,
and I promise you

43:01.546 --> 43:04.280
all those words are gonna
come so much easier.

43:04.315 --> 43:08.050
I have an idea. Can I connect
to your Bluetooth real quick?

43:08.086 --> 43:09.285
Sure.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.287
Katie, so this is
the same exact song.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.323
It's a little more upbeat,
but something you can dance to.

43:14.359 --> 43:17.093
I promise you're gonna remember
every single one of those words.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.763
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

43:34.746 --> 43:37.313
- Tom, get over here, come on.
- Tom, come on!

43:37.348 --> 43:39.615
Get over here!

43:43.421 --> 43:47.223
Come on, dance with me!

43:52.664 --> 43:54.463
Hey, thank you.

43:54.499 --> 43:55.798
Yeah, of course.

43:55.833 --> 43:58.167
Actually, I had a lot of fun.

43:58.202 --> 43:59.568
Yeah, me too.

43:59.604 --> 44:01.170
Hey, you still have some moves.

44:01.205 --> 44:02.638
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:02.674 --> 44:05.741
You have some
pretty cool kids in there.

44:05.777 --> 44:08.311
Yeah. That's all
my sister's doing.

44:08.346 --> 44:09.745
Good genes.

44:09.781 --> 44:11.147
Yeah, I guess.

44:11.182 --> 44:12.548
You're really good with them.

44:12.583 --> 44:14.016
Thanks.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.519
These last few days have
actually been really great,

44:16.554 --> 44:18.587
despite flooding the kitchen.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.793
So should we decorate
our Wonderland tomorrow?

44:23.828 --> 44:24.894
Yeah, sure.

44:24.929 --> 44:26.862
I have some stuff
in the morning,

44:26.898 --> 44:28.230
but I could do the afternoon.

44:28.266 --> 44:29.665
Perfect.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.279
All right, well,
I guess I will see you then?

44:32.303 --> 44:33.869
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

44:33.905 --> 44:35.371
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:38.109 --> 44:39.608
What are you looking for?

44:39.644 --> 44:42.311
This picture of me and Chris.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.280
I mean, Mr. Shepherd.

44:44.315 --> 44:47.783
You guys were boyfriend
and girlfriend, weren't you?

44:47.819 --> 44:49.652
Yeah, we were.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.488
I like him a lot.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.924
Yeah, he's a good guy.

44:56.394 --> 44:57.626
There it is.

44:57.662 --> 44:59.528
It looks like
you're in a fairy tale.

44:59.564 --> 45:01.364
Yeah, it does.

45:06.738 --> 45:09.505
Okay, I think it's time for bed.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.174
- Come on, let's go.
- I am, I am.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.449
Hi.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.918
Aunt Heidi,
you keep outdoing yourself.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.420
Four different kinds of cereal.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.400
Yeah, well, I wanted you
to have the pick of the best

45:26.424 --> 45:28.591
for your big test today.

45:28.626 --> 45:31.627
Hey, it's your mom.

45:31.662 --> 45:33.295
<i>Hey, good morning.</i>

45:33.331 --> 45:34.997
<i>Tom, you ready for your test?</i>

45:35.033 --> 45:36.399
I think so.

45:36.434 --> 45:37.733
Hey, what's your status?

45:37.769 --> 45:39.835
John's grabbing us some lunch.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.904
Unfortunately, there was
bad weather in Atlanta,

45:41.939 --> 45:45.608
so we decided our best bet
was just to keep driving.

45:45.643 --> 45:47.743
It should only take
another day or so.

45:47.779 --> 45:51.213
Hey, Megan, my boss really needs
me back as soon as possible.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.315
<i>Heidi, we're doing
everything we can.</i>

45:53.351 --> 45:55.184
<i>I am so sorry for this.</i>

45:55.219 --> 45:56.752
I know you are.
It's okay.

45:56.788 --> 45:59.088
I'm just gonna let Julia know
what's going on.

45:59.123 --> 46:00.623
So how are things there?

46:00.658 --> 46:02.691
Good. Mr. Shepherd
came over last night

46:02.727 --> 46:04.860
and helped us fix
the dishwasher.

46:04.896 --> 46:07.997
- Oh, did he now?
- Yeah, not like that.

46:08.032 --> 46:10.466
<i>It wasn't like that.
He was just being nice.</i>

46:10.501 --> 46:11.934
I'm sure.

46:11.969 --> 46:14.336
I sure miss you guys so much.

46:14.372 --> 46:15.504
We miss you too.

46:15.540 --> 46:17.139
<i>How's Aunt Heidi's cooking?</i>

46:17.175 --> 46:18.941
It is delicious.

46:18.976 --> 46:21.777
<i>- He's lying, he's lying.
- Delicious, delicious!</i>

46:21.813 --> 46:22.813
<i>I made eggs. Bye!</i>

46:22.847 --> 46:24.313
See you later!

46:26.050 --> 46:27.850
Really?

46:29.887 --> 46:31.954
Okay, what you got
going on today?

46:31.989 --> 46:34.123
We're doing a run-through
of all the songs.

46:34.158 --> 46:35.424
Would you like to come watch?

46:35.460 --> 46:36.959
It would make me less nervous.

46:36.994 --> 46:39.261
Yeah, of course.
I'd love to be there.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.729
Well, maybe I should come too.

46:40.765 --> 46:42.576
No, you're just trying
to get out of that test.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.967
Okay, I'm gonna drop him off,
and I'll be right back.

46:45.002 --> 46:46.302
- Okay.
- All right.

46:46.337 --> 46:47.470
- Bye.
- Have a good day.

46:47.505 --> 46:48.505
Good luck.

46:48.539 --> 46:50.139
Bye!

47:03.421 --> 47:05.221
Good, good, Katie.
That's perfect.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.723
Next time, let's do it with
a little less dancing, yeah?

47:07.758 --> 47:10.359
Great, everyone!
So that's it for today.

47:10.394 --> 47:12.561
We'll see you all tomorrow.

47:14.232 --> 47:15.364
What did you think?

47:15.399 --> 47:16.966
Hey, you were so great.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.135
- And you knew all the words.
- I did.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.537
I just thought of the song
Chris played for us.

47:21.572 --> 47:24.240
Yeah, I know.
I could tell.

47:24.275 --> 47:25.541
I'm really proud of you.

47:25.576 --> 47:27.009
Thanks for watching.

47:27.044 --> 47:28.744
Thanks for letting me watch.

47:28.779 --> 47:32.081
- See ya later.
- Okay, I'll see ya later.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.258
Forgot my lunchbox.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.927
Wanna see my drawing?

48:17.962 --> 48:20.029
Yeah. Which one's yours?

48:20.064 --> 48:21.130
That one.

48:23.501 --> 48:26.302
I really like all the colors.

48:26.337 --> 48:29.438
Are you the art teacher today?

48:29.473 --> 48:31.574
No...

48:31.609 --> 48:33.509
Actually, I used to be
a student here.

48:33.544 --> 48:35.656
I just wanted to come back
and look at my old art room.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.613
Art's my favorite class.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.648
It was mine too.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.016
I hope I do it forever.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.152
I hope you do too.

48:43.187 --> 48:45.654
I gotta go to lunch now. Bye!

48:45.690 --> 48:47.823
Bye.

50:01.532 --> 50:03.165
Whoa!

50:03.200 --> 50:05.501
Eyes on your own tests!

50:10.107 --> 50:11.674
- Good news.
- Okay.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.942
The school board approved
the Wonderland Acres location.

50:13.978 --> 50:14.910
That's great.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.111
And they have increased

50:16.147 --> 50:17.413
the decoration budget

50:17.448 --> 50:18.925
because they loved the idea
that much.

50:18.949 --> 50:20.449
That is even better.

50:20.484 --> 50:23.085
All right, so after school,
you'll get on it, yeah?

50:23.120 --> 50:24.887
I will. I'm picking Heidi up
this afternoon.

50:24.922 --> 50:27.790
I have a double free period,
so...

50:30.061 --> 50:31.093
What?

50:31.128 --> 50:33.562
Nothing.

50:33.597 --> 50:37.333
I mean, you've just, you've been
really happy the last few days.

50:37.368 --> 50:40.069
Yeah. Christmas is almost here.

50:40.104 --> 50:41.337
I love Christmas.

50:41.372 --> 50:42.871
You should tell her
how you feel.

50:42.907 --> 50:44.873
I should?
And how is that?

50:44.909 --> 50:47.120
That you're in love with her
and have been since high school.

50:47.144 --> 50:49.712
You're so ridiculous, Matt,
you know that?

50:49.747 --> 50:50.979
In all seriousness though,

50:51.015 --> 50:52.715
this might be
your second chance.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.616
She lives in New York.

50:54.652 --> 50:57.953
We want different things.
It's just...

50:57.988 --> 51:00.422
It's not gonna work.

51:01.692 --> 51:02.725
I tried.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.993
Have fun decorating.

51:05.029 --> 51:07.796
By the way, word of advice:

51:07.832 --> 51:10.733
Glitter gets everywhere.

51:10.768 --> 51:12.234
Be careful.

51:12.269 --> 51:13.302
I will.

51:13.337 --> 51:15.003
- Careful.
- All right.

51:21.445 --> 51:24.213
All of the Christmas decorations
are right over here.

51:24.248 --> 51:27.416
- Erica, this place is so cute.
- Thank you.

51:27.451 --> 51:29.184
You should check out
the paint section.

51:29.220 --> 51:31.220
I got some of
the best brushes out there.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.722
Maybe you and Erica should
just pick this stuff out.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.457
I don't really have
quite the eye for it.

51:35.493 --> 51:39.027
Come on. Just pick out anything
that looks winter-wonderlandy.

51:39.063 --> 51:40.996
That narrows it down.

51:41.031 --> 51:43.132
It's fun seeing you both
back together.

51:45.336 --> 51:47.336
I mean, just back here in town.

51:47.371 --> 51:50.205
The both of you
in the same space,

51:50.241 --> 51:51.940
not back together-together.

51:52.843 --> 51:54.243
Maybe we should get this going.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.856
- We don't have much time.
- Of course.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.213
Holler if you need me.
I gotta set up a craft table

51:58.249 --> 52:01.316
for the kids' ornament
decorating this afternoon.

52:04.655 --> 52:07.156
- I'm gonna look over here.
- Okay.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.761
Think we should get
a little bit more glitter.

52:12.797 --> 52:15.264
No, no, I think we're
pretty good on the glitter.

52:15.299 --> 52:16.532
Ooh!

52:16.567 --> 52:18.767
What do you think about this?

52:18.803 --> 52:21.270
For my Dance
chaperone outfit, huh?

52:22.406 --> 52:24.173
- It's great.
- Thank you.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.675
I don't know if it really
brings out your eyes though.

52:26.710 --> 52:27.843
I was afraid of that.

52:27.878 --> 52:29.211
Get it anyway.

52:29.246 --> 52:30.312
Okay.

52:30.347 --> 52:31.625
- Hey, these are great.
- Great, right?

52:31.649 --> 52:32.759
We should get
a couple more of those.

52:32.783 --> 52:34.917
- It was a good find.
- Yeah.

52:36.287 --> 52:38.987
You need more supplies.
Look, I stand by what I said.

52:39.023 --> 52:41.123
A mural is the perfect addition
for the Snowball.

52:41.158 --> 52:43.091
- I don't know.
- Come on.

52:43.127 --> 52:44.693
Finding everything?

52:44.728 --> 52:47.262
Yeah. Oh, cute. Are those
all your ornament decorations?

52:47.298 --> 52:48.697
Feel free to make one.

52:48.732 --> 52:50.310
Kids won't be here
for another hour or so.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.945
Actually,
we should probably get going.

52:51.969 --> 52:53.702
I think we could make
a quick one, yeah.

52:53.737 --> 52:56.505
Okay, we will make a quick one.

52:56.540 --> 52:59.641
I have to grab more tinsel
from the back, but go crazy.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.376
Okay.

53:01.412 --> 53:04.580
Ooh, tiny little chairs.

53:06.951 --> 53:09.251
Okay...

53:11.255 --> 53:12.754
You can have that one.

53:12.790 --> 53:14.990
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do gold.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.025
Go for the gold.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.593
Those will look good.

53:41.585 --> 53:43.085
- Okay.
- Done?

53:44.321 --> 53:46.421
- That's really good.
- Thank you.

53:46.457 --> 53:47.990
You must be an artist.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.159
Let me see yours.

53:52.263 --> 53:54.329
Thank you. Yeah.

53:54.365 --> 53:55.631
Lovely. Very nice.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.599
Thank you.
That is very generous of you.

53:57.635 --> 54:00.702
A lot of effort
went into that, yeah.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.771
We should probably
get going though.

54:02.806 --> 54:04.206
Yeah, you're right.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.340
Take it.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.644
Wait for Erica to come back.

54:08.679 --> 54:10.412
Turn.

54:10.447 --> 54:11.747
- What?
- Turn your head.

54:11.782 --> 54:15.217
You have something
in your hair there.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.085
Put that on there.

54:17.121 --> 54:18.620
Thank you.

54:22.993 --> 54:24.259
Want me to ring you up?

54:24.295 --> 54:25.794
That would be great, Erica,
thank you.

54:25.829 --> 54:27.496
Thank you, Erica.

54:46.850 --> 54:49.318
Hey, what do you think if we
hang these lights over there?

54:49.353 --> 54:51.053
I think it's a great idea.

54:51.088 --> 54:53.889
Hey, brought you each
a hot chocolate.

54:53.924 --> 54:55.757
Aw, thanks, Roy.
That's really sweet.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.192
That's all right.

54:57.227 --> 54:59.528
I'm just glad to see
this barn come alive.

54:59.563 --> 55:01.964
Just wait till we add
the layer of glitter.

55:01.999 --> 55:04.399
Layer? I thought we said
subtle dash?

55:04.435 --> 55:06.635
Whatever you both want.

55:06.670 --> 55:09.738
That's what I built
this place for... celebration!

55:09.773 --> 55:11.318
Then do you mind
if we use the wood panel,

55:11.342 --> 55:13.241
so Heidi can paint a mural?

55:13.277 --> 55:14.676
We can hang it
above the staircase.

55:14.712 --> 55:16.211
A mural?

55:16.246 --> 55:17.646
Yeah, she's a great painter.

55:17.681 --> 55:19.114
I promise you
it'll be top-notch.

55:19.149 --> 55:20.949
Hey, Chris, that's fine.

55:20.985 --> 55:22.684
You're a painter?

55:22.720 --> 55:24.119
Yes.

55:24.154 --> 55:28.390
Actually, I just painted
something of Wonderland Acres.

55:28.425 --> 55:30.659
Here.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.463
You're quite an artist.

55:34.498 --> 55:37.366
Yeah, you can use
whatever you need.

55:37.401 --> 55:38.767
What you gonna paint?

55:38.802 --> 55:40.602
You know, I haven't
worked that out yet.

55:40.638 --> 55:43.038
Well, I'm looking forward
to seeing it.

55:43.073 --> 55:44.706
I'll be back.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.542
I can't wait either.

55:48.812 --> 55:50.946
- Did you get it untangled?
- Yeah.

55:50.981 --> 55:52.681
That looks pretty good, right?

55:52.716 --> 55:53.782
Yeah, it looks good.

55:53.817 --> 55:55.017
Okay.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.186
- You okay?
- Yeah.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.327
I'm sorry.

56:05.362 --> 56:07.829
For what?

56:07.865 --> 56:09.765
For ending things so soon.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.378
I just thought it was
the right thing to do.

56:11.402 --> 56:13.335
I figured we'd never end up
in the same place,

56:13.370 --> 56:16.805
so it was better to end it early
than to drag it out and...

56:16.840 --> 56:18.106
and hurt more.

56:18.142 --> 56:20.942
You did what you thought
was best. I get it.

56:22.446 --> 56:26.648
Okay, let's work on this now.

56:26.684 --> 56:28.417
All right.

56:28.452 --> 56:30.886
I was thinking we could just
sprinkle it all over the room

56:30.921 --> 56:32.754
so the whole place
kind of sparkles.

56:32.790 --> 56:35.323
It seems like a lot.
It might get everywhere.

56:35.359 --> 56:37.626
The worst thing would be
standing in front of my class,

56:37.661 --> 56:38.705
having a student point
at my hair,

56:38.729 --> 56:39.873
saying "I saw glitter in it,"

56:39.897 --> 56:41.430
like four months from now.

56:41.465 --> 56:43.465
Really?

56:43.500 --> 56:47.636
So that would be like the worst
thing in the world for you?

56:47.671 --> 56:48.937
Yeah, pretty much.

56:51.175 --> 56:52.741
Did that really just happen?

56:52.776 --> 56:55.110
Yeah, I think it did.

56:56.180 --> 56:58.280
Good luck getting all that out.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.836
Hey. What happened to you?

57:20.871 --> 57:22.816
You know, just making
this year's Snowball Dance

57:22.840 --> 57:24.773
one they will remember forever.

57:24.808 --> 57:26.675
You look like a unicorn
sneezed on you.

57:26.710 --> 57:29.344
Thank you.
Hey, how'd your test go?

57:29.379 --> 57:30.679
Good.
I went back to check

57:30.714 --> 57:32.247
if Mr. Shepherd
had graded them yet,

57:32.282 --> 57:33.448
but he wasn't there.

57:33.484 --> 57:34.683
That's 'cause he was with me.

57:34.718 --> 57:36.251
We were decorating
for the dance.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.587
I should've known.

57:41.125 --> 57:43.859
What? You don't wanna be seen
with your glitter-covered aunt?

57:43.894 --> 57:45.827
That and I heard through
a couple of people

57:45.863 --> 57:47.696
that Ryan did ask Monica
to the dance.

57:47.731 --> 57:49.064
I'm sorry.

57:49.099 --> 57:51.833
It's okay.
Wasn't meant to be.

57:51.869 --> 57:53.268
Hey.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.504
You never know
what the future holds.

58:06.150 --> 58:08.150
Where's the other half
of your decorating team?

58:08.185 --> 58:10.218
I'm flying solo at the moment.

58:10.254 --> 58:11.787
Dance is in three days,

58:11.822 --> 58:13.466
so I'm trying to get
as much done as possible.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.023
- Yeah, it looks good.
- Thanks.

58:15.058 --> 58:17.359
I just wish my wife
could have been here

58:17.394 --> 58:19.828
to see this place
all decorated like this.

58:19.863 --> 58:21.207
I didn't realize
she wasn't here.

58:21.231 --> 58:24.699
No, she passed away
a few years back.

58:24.735 --> 58:26.168
This whole thing was her idea.

58:26.203 --> 58:29.337
I just kept going with
the renovations for her.

58:29.373 --> 58:31.173
I'm sorry.

58:31.208 --> 58:34.075
Well, so am I.

58:34.111 --> 58:37.112
It's rare when you find somebody
who fits your soul

58:37.147 --> 58:38.647
like a good pair of gloves.

58:38.682 --> 58:41.149
And that's what we were,
the perfect fit.

58:42.619 --> 58:45.687
But look at me, I'm distracting
you from your work.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.122
No, that's okay.

58:47.157 --> 58:49.691
You've done a lot
with this glitter.

58:49.726 --> 58:51.359
Do you think it's too much?

58:51.395 --> 58:54.329
No, no, no,
it's marvelous, yeah.

58:54.364 --> 58:55.897
Thanks.

58:59.636 --> 59:01.169
I don't think
anyone's ever bought

59:01.205 --> 59:02.804
this much paint at one time.

59:02.840 --> 59:06.641
Really? I don't know.
I guess I just feel inspired

59:06.677 --> 59:09.110
for the first time
in a long time,

59:09.146 --> 59:12.214
like I've...
woken up or something.

59:12.249 --> 59:15.984
Maybe you just finally
have the time now.

59:16.019 --> 59:18.787
No, I mean, I'm really busy
watching Megan's kids,

59:18.822 --> 59:21.623
and I'm supposed to be back
at work in New York right now,

59:21.658 --> 59:24.259
but here I am.

59:24.294 --> 59:26.528
Then maybe it's Pleasant Valley.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.063
What do you mean?

59:28.098 --> 59:30.565
This is where you
fell in love with painting.

59:30.601 --> 59:35.570
Perhaps you're discovering it
all over again.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.906
Maybe. I hadn't
thought of that.

59:51.355 --> 59:52.921
This should help.

59:52.956 --> 59:54.556
The first Snowball Dance
photographed

59:54.591 --> 59:56.157
was in the early '20s.

59:56.193 --> 01:00:01.129
And then these are some of the
older yearbooks and newspapers.

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:04.633
This is perfect.
Thank you.

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:06.401
No worries.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.503
So you're gonna tell me
what this is all for now?

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.672
No. You'll find out
soon enough.

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.874
Whatever it is,
I appreciate all you're doing

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.209
to help with the Snowball.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.378
- It's actually been really fun.
- Good.

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.380
I'm glad you and Chris
are getting along.

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:20.782
Yeah, we make a good team.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:23.852
You guys were always
great together.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.490
I should get to
the school board meeting.

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:30.191
If you need anything else,
let me know.

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:32.961
Okay, great, thank you.

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:35.363
I put another book in that stack

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:36.865
that you should check out.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.622
You look like
you've been here a while.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.025
Yeah, all night.
Both the kids had sleepovers

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.093
to celebrate the start
of Christmas break.

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:13.628
Painting the mural?

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.563
- Yeah, you wanna come see?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.632
But you have to close your eyes.

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.035
- Seriously?
- Yes, for the full effect.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.369
Come on.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.138
All right. You guiding me?
I can't see.

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.639
Yeah, I'm guiding you.

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.642
- Can I open now?
- No, not yet.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:31.146
Okay, now you can look.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.319
That's incredible.

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:41.723
<i>I call it Snowball Dance
of Christmas Past.</i>

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.726
It's a snapshot of every
Snowball since it started.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.428
Matt gave me some yearbooks,

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:49.798
so I could get the feel of how
everybody dressed and looked.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.933
Is that us?

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:55.036
Yeah.

01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:57.539
That's the year we were crowned
Snow King and Queen.

01:02:57.574 --> 01:02:59.908
I love it, Heidi.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.310
Everyone is gonna love it.

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:29.971
Hey, isn't this...

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.006
Our song?

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.508
Acoustics sound pretty good
in here.

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.043
There's only one way
to find out.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:58.199
- Pretty good.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:03:58.235 --> 01:04:00.001
I read your book.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.469
Really?

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:02.937
Well, I flipped through it.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.450
We all know history
isn't my strong suit.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.976
Very true. I'm thinking
of writing another one.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.411
Pretty soon I'll get
to teach my book in my class.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:13.781
Yeah. It's really great
that you found your calling.

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:16.217
Must have been hard when you
couldn't play hockey anymore.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:19.821
It was, but then
I found a new dream.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.789
Maybe that's what I should do.

01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:24.025
Or you could just
get reacquainted

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.593
with your original one.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:29.197
I mean, that mural is...

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:30.698
it's amazing, Heidi.

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:33.101
It's 'cause of this town.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.502
The past.

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.472
Us.

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:45.413
It's my boss. She's been
trying to reach me all day.

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.081
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.183
<i>Heidi?</i>

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.484
Hey, is everything okay?

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:52.053
My phone has been
blowing up all day.

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:53.488
Because of the party?

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:57.458
No. That painting
you sent April,

01:04:57.494 --> 01:05:00.261
she put it up on
our gallery's art space page.

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:02.197
<i>All of our clients
have been asking about it.</i>

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.465
I didn't realize she posted it.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:07.302
It's a really great painting.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:08.977
<i>In fact, some people
have even mentioned</i>

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.772
<i>that they wanna see
more of your stuff.</i>

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.574
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:14.909
Look, I've been thinking.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.678
I know I haven't been
very supportive

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.112
of your art in the past,

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:20.748
<i>but I want that to change.</i>

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:22.061
<i>Why don't you bring
your painting</i>

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.651
<i>to the Christmas party?</i>

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:25.086
I want to put it on display.

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.055
You won't just be
my right-hand woman.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.225
You'll be
a contributing artist, okay?

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:34.462
Okay.
I don't know what to say.

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.664
Well, say that you're gonna
be there no matter what.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.701
None of this stuck in
your hometown nonsense.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.204
Yes, I will absolutely be there.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.573
Great. We'll talk later.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.012
Good news?

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:52.580
Yeah.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:55.450
Actually, my boss loved the
painting of Wonderland Acres.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:57.318
- That's great.
- Yeah. She's just worried

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:59.988
that I won't be back in time
for the gallery Christmas party.

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:02.357
- And when's the party?
- Monday.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.792
So you can't go the Snowball?

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:06.794
See all of our hard work
pay off?

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.464
Yeah, I know.
It's just that...

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.633
my job really depends
on this party.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:14.013
Now it feels like I have even
more reason to get back there.

01:06:14.037 --> 01:06:15.270
So when do you leave?

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.838
As soon as Megan and John
get back.

01:06:16.873 --> 01:06:18.417
Otherwise, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.919
I'll have to find somebody
to watch the kids.

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:21.643
They'll be back,
or I'll watch the kids.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.978
Look, some stuff is meant to be,

01:06:24.014 --> 01:06:26.648
and your art should
be seen by everyone.

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.985
Thanks. Thank you
for always believing in me.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.291
I'm gonna get going.
I got a bunch of tests to grade.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.193
Okay.

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:53.808
That was nice of you
to give Erica the night off.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.176
She made it very clear

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:56.689
that I had to take
the twins somewhere

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.646
and let her catch up
on her Christmas shopping.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:00.682
Listen, we're gonna go
over to Maple Street,

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.050
check out the lights.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.252
- You wanna join?
- Think I'm gonna pass.

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:05.920
You'd rather walk
around aimlessly

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.388
and be bummed
that Heidi's leaving?

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.457
I am not gonna do that.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.826
All right, maybe just a little.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.172
It's just these
past few days, man,

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.540
all these feelings
keep rushing back.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:15.530
I don't know what to do.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:16.998
Maybe she feels the same way.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.200
She wouldn't of gone
to New York again.

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.902
I feel like I'm having déjà vu.

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:22.403
Look, Matt, I told you.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:24.706
I'm not gonna stand in the way
of her dreams.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.642
Listen to me.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:32.180
You telling her how you feel
is not standing in her way.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:35.049
All right, if anything,
it might help lead her way.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.886
Look, I'm just gonna
grab some dinner.

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:40.788
All right.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:44.759
And hey, thank you for
everything with Snowball Dance.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:46.627
I know it wasn't your forte.

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:51.165
Ended up being
the best part of my year.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:57.839
Hey, don't look so sad.
New York's not that far away.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:59.118
I'm gonna come back
and visit really soon.

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:00.541
The whole reason
we got milkshakes

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:02.744
is so we can have
a fun last night.

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:04.078
Yeah, we know.

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:05.880
It's been really great
having you here.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.081
We're gonna miss you.

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.350
Yeah, it has been really great.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:10.918
Even when you
flooded the kitchen.

01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:13.454
Even when I flooded the kitchen.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:17.591
Will you be glad
to go back to New York?

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.127
Yeah. Why do you ask?

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.863
You just look sad about it too.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:25.332
Well, I'm gonna miss
everybody here.

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:33.674
- Hey, Mr. Shepherd.
- Hey.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.642
Hi.

01:08:34.676 --> 01:08:35.777
Milkshakes, huh?

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.044
What is the occasion?

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.412
Fun last night with Aunt Heidi.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.647
Aw.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:40.848
Hey, why don't you join us?

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.183
No, I don't wanna intrude.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.651
No, it's okay.
You can sit down.

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.819
Okay. Well, I shouldn't
be telling you this

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.854
because I haven't given
the grades out yet,

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.991
but you're already celebrating.

01:08:50.026 --> 01:08:51.826
Tom, you made an A
on the retake test.

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.294
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:55.129
- Nice work, Tom.
- I knew you had it in you.

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:57.832
Yeah, once I found out Ryan was
taking Monica to the dance,

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:00.501
I guess I was
less distracted in class.

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:02.247
Well, I'm not super up
on the student gossip,

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.837
but I do own a chaperone list,

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:07.341
and Ryan's mom said
he's taking Sarah Lang.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:09.310
Really?

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.379
Well, I mean,
it's probably too late.

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.080
The dance is
the day after tomorrow.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:15.082
Hey, how do you know
unless you try?

01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:17.551
Yeah, you gotta take a risk.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.520
I'll be right back.
I have to make a call.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:24.959
Teenage boys, am I right?

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:30.096
Wanna try my milkshake?
I got seven flavors.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.499
You got seven flavors?

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:33.000
Oh, my gosh,
that sounds so good,

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:34.801
but I kinda wanted
some real food.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.238
Hey, are you saying
milkshakes aren't real food?

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.207
We are personally offended.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.443
Hey, she said yes.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.212
- Yay!
- All right!

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:45.925
See? I hope you learned
something here today.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.850
Yeah, sometimes
you just gotta go for it.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.561
Hello?

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:01.896
Hello!

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.264
Grandma, Grandpa!

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:05.399
- There's my peanut! Hey!
- Sweetheart!

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.401
Hey, bud!

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:10.137
I didn't think you were gonna
be here till Christmas day.

01:10:10.173 --> 01:10:13.040
Well, when we finally
docked in Italy,

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:16.010
we got Megan's message
that you were watching the kids,

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.112
and we figured
we'd better come home and help.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.658
Not that we thought
you were incapable.

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:21.182
It's just we know
you're very busy.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.484
- No, Aunt Heidi's been great.
- Thanks.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.964
Now you're here on time
for my pageant.

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:27.822
Yeah! Where's John and Megan?

01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:29.457
They had to rent a car,

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:31.392
so they're not gonna be here
until tomorrow.

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:33.194
Wait, if Grandma
and Grandpa are here,

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.829
does that mean
you're gonna leave?

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:36.664
No, I'm not gonna
miss your pageant.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.266
- I'll leave right after.
- Okay.

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:40.501
It sounds like you've had
a couple of wild days.

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:41.869
Yeah, you have no idea.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.771
Well, come on in,
and I'll fix you dinner.

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:46.307
We're full.
We just had milkshakes.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.410
But we're still hungry,

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.746
so Grandma's gonna make
something really healthy.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.548
Thanks, Mom.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.349
Come on, Grandma.

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:03.391
Alas, the angel is here.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.794
She will bring word
of what's to come.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.952
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.054
I cannot thank you enough
for all that you did.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.724
I've actually never seen Tom
and Katie in better moods.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:12.460
You raised some fantastic kids.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.340
I'm just happy I got to spend
some time with them.

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:18.032
And sounds like some time
with Chris Shepherd.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.267
I know what you're thinking.

01:12:20.303 --> 01:12:21.936
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:25.373
You're thinking that seeing him
again after all this time,

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:29.076
it brought back all
the feelings I used to have.

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:31.579
Okay, maybe I was thinking that.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:34.148
And...

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.850
you'd be right.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.451
What am I supposed to do?

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:40.187
I mean, my boss finally
sees me as a real artist,

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:43.891
and she wants to help
with my career.

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.626
But all I wanna do

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:48.462
is go to a high school dance
with Chris Shepherd?

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:51.499
I mean, I was so sure
for so long

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:54.135
that living in the city
and being successful,

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:55.870
that's all that mattered.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.473
But you know, then I came home,

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:02.677
and I felt inspired
to paint again.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:06.414
So maybe what you
thought you wanted

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:08.916
is different than
what you actually needed.

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:11.285
Yeah.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.921
Maybe.

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:16.057
If I'm honest,
I was kind of hoping you guys

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.925
wouldn't come home in time,
and I could stay,

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.162
but then Mom and Dad showed up,
so I knew I had to go back.

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:22.763
Okay, that is very telling.

01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:24.565
Yeah.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.670
I think I really owe it
to myself to see this through.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:32.606
Okay. I mean, that's okay.
We'll always be here.

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:35.309
Yeah, I know.

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.211
But...

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.679
Chris might not.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:41.315
Yeah, that's true,

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:43.017
unless you tell him
how you feel.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:47.722
Meg, I already
broke his heart once.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.557
I cannot do it again.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:53.160
And plus, my life is
so up in the air right now.

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:55.663
I don't wanna drag him along.

01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:57.398
Okay.

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.536
Well, I should go.

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.539
Can you explain...

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:08.109
the seven pizza boxes
that I found in the trash?

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:12.046
No, I cannot.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:14.815
Has all the food groups.
It's fine.

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:18.552
Bye.

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:21.655
Hey, Katie,
I have something for you.

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.428
- You painted this for me?
- I did, yeah.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:32.833
I love it.
Thank you so much.

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:35.035
You're welcome. Okay.

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:38.072
- Bye, guys. Love you.
- Thanks again. Travel safe.

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:41.041
We're going to the airport.
We're gonna make a stop first.

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:42.910
No problem.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.146
- Bye.
- Love you.

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:17.444
This looks great.

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.881
I thought you left already.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:24.518
Wanted to come by,
see how it all turned out.

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:27.054
Say goodbye.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.858
Well, it looks amazing,
thanks to you.

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:32.526
Thanks to us.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:35.796
Listen, Chris,

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:39.333
this past week
has been wonderful.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:42.169
I can see why high-school-me
fell in love with you so easily.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:46.140
And present-day-you,
how does she feel?

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.710
She feels confused.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.947
Don't be.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.249
You went to New York
to become this amazing artist,

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:56.984
and you should do that.

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:58.519
You should follow what you want.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.688
That's what I loved about you.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.424
That's what's what
I've always loved about you.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.496
That's my ride.

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:15.736
Bye, Chris.

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:18.072
Goodbye, Heidi.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:38.893
Hey, let me help you.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.262
Thanks, Chris.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:43.497
So I'm glad to see you guys
made it back in one piece.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:45.232
I know. What a crazy week.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:46.945
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't help
with the Snowball.

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.637
It's okay.
Heidi did an amazing job.

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:51.316
Hope you can come see it
all decked out tonight.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.641
The mural she did
is a masterpiece.

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:54.975
Tom has made it very clear

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:57.111
we are only supposed
to drop him off.

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:59.980
Don't worry.
John and I will find our way in.

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:02.316
Today's Heidi's big day, huh?

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:04.852
- Yeah. I hope it all goes well.
- Yeah, me too.

01:17:04.887 --> 01:17:07.154
She seemed pretty upset
when she left.

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:10.357
- Really?
- Yeah, she...

01:17:10.393 --> 01:17:11.992
She had this sad look
in her eyes.

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:16.463
Sort of like the one
you have right now.

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:18.966
You know, it's funny.
When I came back from college,

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:22.102
I thought I had everything
I ever wanted.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.971
Truth is, I was always
missing something.

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:27.107
I wish you both would tell
these things to each other.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.642
Timing is not right.

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:32.980
It never will be if you're
always waiting for it.

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.182
I better get these
into the fridge.

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.784
Right, of course.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.218
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.054
Hey, tell Tom
I will see him tonight.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:41.755
I will. Merry Christmas.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.490
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:45.252
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.821
- Thank you. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you so much.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.360
Heidi, come. I want you
to meet Vince and Leo.

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:54.762
Hi.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:57.664
Heidi is responsible for
making the gallery what it is.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.601
All of these paintings
have been acquired by her.

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:02.536
Can you get me
the gallery catalog?

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.583
I want to show Leo the
gallery painting we just sold.

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:06.106
Sure. Nice to meet you.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:09.043
You are going to love his work.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:12.446
Don't you just wanna
crawl inside this painting?

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.281
That place looks so magical.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:17.518
It's beautiful.
I love it.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:20.821
Julia talking up your art?

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.222
No, not yet.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:25.159
Well, I'm sure she will soon.

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:27.027
Maybe.

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:30.297
But you know what?
If she doesn't, that's okay.

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:33.762
The only person that's gonna
make time for my art is me.

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:37.838
I have to go.

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.273
What do you mean?

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:42.109
I just mean...

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:44.344
there's someplace I'd rather be.

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.888
That one is right back there.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.925
Yes, right. Okay, yeah.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.526
Where are you going?

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:03.464
I haven't had a chance
to show off your painting yet.

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:05.499
Julia, I can't work
for the gallery anymore.

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:09.369
You can't leave.
This is your big opportunity.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.706
I don't belong here.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.975
I thought if I wanted
to be a great artist,

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.145
I had to move to the city and
adapt to a certain lifestyle,

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.048
but instead,
I just completely lost track

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:24.852
of why I wanted to paint
in the first place.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:28.188
I miss that feeling
of inspiration,

01:20:28.224 --> 01:20:29.690
when a moment
is so overwhelming,

01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:31.458
you have no choice
but to create.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:35.729
I had that when I was at home.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.197
When I was with Chris.

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:38.298
Who?

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:41.001
Julia, thank you so much
for everything.

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:43.337
This has been
such a great opportunity,

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:44.705
and I've learned so much,

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.374
but it's not where I wanna be.

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:50.010
- I have to go.
- Don't leave yet.

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.246
Look, we'll show some
of your work to some agents.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:54.014
Maybe some other time.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:57.684
If I leave right now,
I can still make the dance.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.319
Merry Christmas.

01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:03.590
What dance?

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:11.331
Say Christmas!

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.034
- Christmas!
- Nice.

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:26.914
This is amazing.

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:28.448
Best Snowball in history.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.451
I mean, glitter usage aside.

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:36.096
After the dance, we should
hang that mural at the school.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:37.324
Couldn't agree more.

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.426
You and Heidi
did a wonderful job.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:42.963
Must be nice to have a night
away from the kids, huh?

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:45.999
Romantic night
in a romantic setting

01:21:46.035 --> 01:21:48.035
is just what was needed.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.970
Brings back memories.

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:52.339
Yes, it does.
Yes, it does.

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:56.376
Hey, we know you wish
someone else was here,

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.779
but try to have
some fun tonight.

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:01.348
I mean, this is all
because of you.

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:14.796
Hey!

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.242
Hey.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:32.879
How about we finish that dance?

01:22:32.915 --> 01:22:34.381
What are you doing here?

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.617
Well, I figured I ruined
our last Snowball,

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:38.719
so I might as well
make up for it.

01:22:38.754 --> 01:22:40.954
And what about New York?

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:47.060
Well, you told me
to go for what I want,

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.763
and... that's you.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.066
Here.

01:22:53.102 --> 01:22:54.801
Right now.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:05.746
- I love you, Heidi.
- I love you too.
