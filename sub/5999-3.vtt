00:00.696 --> 00:02.562
<i>Previously on "Manhattan"...</i>

00:05.851 --> 00:07.952
<i>When the time comes,
someone will contact you.</i>

00:07.986 --> 00:11.322
He'll have the other half
of this.

00:11.324 --> 00:12.823
- Crosley.
- Hi.

00:12.825 --> 00:14.825
This is really
not a good time.

00:14.876 --> 00:17.128
Are you...

00:17.162 --> 00:18.713
We'll be forming
a new test group.

00:18.747 --> 00:20.715
<i>There will be
an announcement soon.</i>

00:20.749 --> 00:22.833
How did you know that
Mrs. Winter was the girl for you?

00:22.835 --> 00:25.386
<i>Was it like Einstein discovering
spatial relativity?</i>

00:25.420 --> 00:27.004
That took Albert
a couple years.

00:27.055 --> 00:29.140
- I'm Abby.
- Elodie.

00:29.174 --> 00:31.392
<i>Enchant√©.</i>

00:31.926 --> 00:34.228
- Callie!
<i>-  Sorry, ma'am.</i>

00:34.262 --> 00:36.263
<i>If you took her away,
I'd never see her again.</i>

00:38.350 --> 00:40.017
<i>There was an
incident in Ithaca.</i>

00:40.068 --> 00:41.519
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

00:41.521 --> 00:44.071
You're all right now,
aren't you?

00:44.106 --> 00:46.657
Jesus, Glen, I can't
do this without you.

00:46.691 --> 00:50.361
You're gonna have to.
They want me off the Hill.

00:50.363 --> 00:53.364
- Where is he?
-<i> Your husband is at another site</i>

00:53.415 --> 00:55.366
proving his loyalty
to his country.

01:11.049 --> 01:12.692
_

01:12.717 --> 01:15.686
Brought you a newspaper.
Sunday "Times."

01:15.720 --> 01:17.354
They took it from me
at the door.

01:17.389 --> 01:19.390
They're afraid the news
will upset us.

01:19.392 --> 01:22.059
I trust you'll tell me
if Hitler invades Nantucket,

01:22.110 --> 01:24.395
starts a world war.

01:24.446 --> 01:26.230
Speaking of Fascists,

01:26.281 --> 01:28.065
I thought I'd bring
your sister next week.

01:28.067 --> 01:30.901
I'd rather nobody
know I was here.

01:35.457 --> 01:37.241
Where's your wedding ring?

01:37.292 --> 01:39.410
We're not allowed
to wear them.

01:39.461 --> 01:42.246
Why? So you'll forget
you've got a husband?

01:42.297 --> 01:44.915
So we don't swallow them
and choke ourselves.

01:50.089 --> 01:53.891
You lost count.
You took too many pills.

01:53.925 --> 01:55.593
It does not
make you suicidal.

01:55.595 --> 01:58.979
Let's look at
the silver lining.

01:59.014 --> 02:00.898
I finally took up a hobby.

02:02.602 --> 02:04.602
<i>- Nurse.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

02:04.604 --> 02:06.770
Someone must have
shown her the newspaper.

02:09.941 --> 02:11.408
<i>Come with me.</i>

02:11.443 --> 02:12.610
I'm sorry.
Visiting hours are over.

02:12.612 --> 02:14.028
Thank you.

02:20.586 --> 02:23.087
I am going to bring you home.

02:24.121 --> 02:27.540
Callie's going to
hate this scarf.

02:29.044 --> 02:31.295
Come here.
Yeah.

02:40.305 --> 02:42.439
I'll see you next week.

02:42.474 --> 02:45.442
<i>What was
science fiction yesterday</i>

02:45.477 --> 02:47.311
<i>is a reality today.</i>

02:47.313 --> 02:49.813
<i>Hahn and Strassmann work
at the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti--</i>

02:49.865 --> 02:52.449
- No, no.
Turn that back, please.

02:53.084 --> 02:54.652
<i>...blocks of all matter.</i>

02:54.654 --> 02:57.288
<i>German scientists have
managed to split the atom,</i>

02:57.322 --> 02:59.657
<i>releasing 200 million volts.</i>

02:59.659 --> 03:01.492
<i>A major discovery in physics,</i>

03:01.543 --> 03:04.044
<i>atomic energy could become
a promising source of fuel</i>

03:04.079 --> 03:06.080
<i>in the decades to come.</i>

03:07.499 --> 03:09.300
It's called a neutron.

03:09.334 --> 03:11.385
It's a particle inside
the nucleus of an atom.

03:11.419 --> 03:13.837
When you bombard
uranium with neutrons,

03:13.889 --> 03:15.673
you can split it apart,

03:15.675 --> 03:17.675
releasing all
of that, uh--

03:17.677 --> 03:21.011
that energy, that power
that's locked inside.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.483
Imagine the sun
rising in the west.

03:26.518 --> 03:28.319
And you know how
to build this contraption?

03:28.353 --> 03:30.154
I know it can be built.

03:30.188 --> 03:32.072
Hitler is already
stockpiling uranium.

03:32.107 --> 03:34.575
I have been to Germany.
I know their starting lineup.

03:36.528 --> 03:38.529
They will succeed at this.

03:38.580 --> 03:42.199
So you're telling me I need
a bomb that doesn't exist

03:42.201 --> 03:44.668
to win a war that we won't be
involved in when it starts?

03:44.703 --> 03:46.503
- We'll--
- If it starts.

03:46.538 --> 03:48.778
We'll get in.
You know we will.

03:55.380 --> 03:58.515
- We'll take it under consideration.
- Thank you.

03:58.550 --> 04:02.353
Saw Elaine last week at the
university club with her new beau.

04:02.387 --> 04:03.721
Someday you got to tell me

04:03.723 --> 04:05.389
how to unload a wife
so smoothly.

04:05.391 --> 04:07.725
It's all in the wrist.

04:09.394 --> 04:10.945
Gentlemen.

04:13.064 --> 04:16.533
All right, so who's next
in your little black book?

04:16.567 --> 04:19.536
Maybe it's time
to close the book.

04:19.571 --> 04:21.988
Some genies belong
in their lamps.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.629
So are we going to
talk about it, kiddo?

04:28.663 --> 04:30.714
What do you think
we're doing right now?

04:30.749 --> 04:33.133
I mean whatever
is really going on

04:33.168 --> 04:35.135
inside that egg head
of yours.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.972
Obsessing over hypothetical
chain reactions

04:38.006 --> 04:40.140
so you can ignore what?

04:40.175 --> 04:42.092
The perils
of the tenure committee?

04:42.143 --> 04:43.927
Cornell's fine.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.930
And Liza? What does she
have to say about all this?

04:46.932 --> 04:49.149
Liza's got enough
on her mind right now.

04:49.184 --> 04:51.602
She still on
her research sabbatical?

04:53.188 --> 04:55.155
We need to think bigger.

04:55.190 --> 04:59.193
You must know someone
with a line to the president.

05:05.617 --> 05:07.785
We can still drive back
to the city.

05:07.787 --> 05:09.953
Leave the cap on this bottle.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.955
Open a beer instead.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.208
Without getting
my autograph book signed?

05:16.378 --> 05:19.430
I don't want to be the guy
who lives to regret it.

05:19.464 --> 05:20.898
Do you?

05:31.086 --> 05:32.586

06:16.154 --> 06:18.539
<i>Right there. Thanks.</i>

06:25.497 --> 06:28.332
Editor said the writer's on
assignment and unreachable.

06:28.334 --> 06:31.468
I informed him that wartime secrecy
guidelines prohibit them--

06:31.503 --> 06:33.671
Census record.

06:33.673 --> 06:35.839
Get me this reporter's
individual census record,

06:35.891 --> 06:39.476
his last income tax return,
and his current home address.

06:39.511 --> 06:40.895
Yes, sir.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.693
Colonel.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.274
_

07:00.699 --> 07:03.033
I trust you informed them
of their mistake.

07:03.084 --> 07:04.335
I have.

07:04.369 --> 07:05.703
Why not bring Frank back

07:05.705 --> 07:07.871
and we can clear up
this confusion?

07:07.923 --> 07:10.874
There's some confusion I'd
like to clear up right here

07:10.926 --> 07:12.843
concerning the source
of this story.

07:13.877 --> 07:16.513
I'm not permitted
to leave the Hill.

07:16.548 --> 07:20.517
And all my correspondence
is monitored by you, yes?

07:20.552 --> 07:23.520
You know, if Dr. Winter were in less
than comfortable circumstances--

07:23.555 --> 07:25.522
Which he isn't.

07:25.557 --> 07:29.610
I would worry they may not
improve after today's events.

07:32.948 --> 07:36.450
Perhaps you'd like to
repeat that, Colonel,

07:36.484 --> 07:39.570
to my colleagues here
on the town council.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.294
May I have everyone's
attention, please?

07:47.829 --> 07:51.081
Due to the new J-1
secrecy restrictions,

07:51.083 --> 07:54.752
as of today, the town
council is disbanded.

07:54.754 --> 07:57.755
<i>What? What did he say?</i>

08:12.487 --> 08:13.937
Where's the rest?

08:13.989 --> 08:15.572
<i>That's it for today.</i>

08:15.607 --> 08:16.940
<i>Bad behavior.</i>

08:16.992 --> 08:18.442
What did I do?

08:19.144 --> 08:20.661
Not your bad behavior.

08:30.664 --> 08:33.249
Right away,
Dr. Oppenheimer.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.251
There must be another
secret city in California.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.734
He calls over there
three times a week.

08:39.923 --> 08:41.256
Do you ever, um--

08:41.259 --> 08:42.991
Listen to
Oppenheimer's calls?

08:43.527 --> 08:44.927
Pretty sure
that's a war crime.

08:44.929 --> 08:46.346
Hmm.

08:48.098 --> 08:50.600
But I think I heard
Roosevelt's voice once.

09:10.838 --> 09:13.089
<i>Get my care package?</i>

09:13.123 --> 09:14.457
<i>I thought gift-giving</i>

09:14.508 --> 09:16.459
<i>was a bourgeois convention.</i>

09:16.510 --> 09:18.294
<i>Although I don't have
any neckties</i>

09:18.296 --> 09:20.129
<i>with Arabian slaves on them.</i>

09:21.080 --> 09:22.932
<i>I had a dream.</i>

09:22.966 --> 09:24.300
<i>You were a greyhound</i>

09:24.351 --> 09:26.302
<i>and we were
climbing a mountain.</i>

09:26.304 --> 09:28.471
<i>And when
we reached the summit,</i>

09:28.522 --> 09:32.108
<i>you jumped up and licked
my thighs until I came.</i>

09:32.142 --> 09:35.111
<i>I strangled you
with your leash.</i>

09:35.145 --> 09:36.479
<i>The destruction of the one</i>

09:36.530 --> 09:38.314
<i>is the production of another.</i>

09:38.316 --> 09:41.701
<i>Isn't that what Jung says?</i>

09:41.735 --> 09:44.037
<i>Bring the necktie
to San Francisco.</i>

09:44.071 --> 09:46.539
<i>I'm going to make you
beg for air.</i>

09:58.335 --> 10:01.137
Okay, well, let's just say
we had invented space travel

10:01.171 --> 10:03.389
and you had the chance
to go to--

10:03.424 --> 10:04.974
to Jupiter, for instance.

10:05.008 --> 10:08.010
- Evening, Dr. Isaacs.
- Have a good night.

10:09.062 --> 10:10.513
Oh, my God.
Suck-ups.

10:10.564 --> 10:13.149
Anyway, Jupiter,
the most majestic

10:13.183 --> 10:16.152
and mysterious of all the
planets in the solar system--

10:16.186 --> 10:18.020
but there's a catch.

10:18.022 --> 10:19.522
It's a one-way ticket.

10:19.973 --> 10:22.992
You will never see
your friends or family again.

10:23.026 --> 10:24.577
<i>Are there girls
on this spaceship?</i>

10:24.611 --> 10:27.163
It's a journey
of 365 million miles.

10:27.197 --> 10:30.366
You'll get to see the Galilean
moons, the Great Red Spot,

10:30.368 --> 10:34.003
but you have to
give up everything.

10:34.037 --> 10:36.923
You're standing on the
threshold of the capsule

10:36.957 --> 10:39.175
and you have to decide
do you go?

10:39.209 --> 10:40.543
- Shit, no. Do you?
- Ah!

10:40.594 --> 10:42.178
I don't know.
I mean, on the one hand,

10:42.212 --> 10:43.772
you're the first
interplanetary tourist,

10:43.797 --> 10:46.182
like Vasco da Gama,
but then on the other hand,

10:46.216 --> 10:48.184
you start thinking
about your family and--

10:48.218 --> 10:49.769
Oh, shit.

10:49.803 --> 10:51.771
What's the matter?

10:55.609 --> 10:57.443
Jesus Christ.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.064
Hi. Excuse me.

11:05.402 --> 11:08.070
Hi. Just looking
for someone, sir.

11:09.406 --> 11:11.207
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.

11:11.241 --> 11:13.042
- I need to talk to you.
- Fritz?

11:13.076 --> 11:15.211
In the lab, we were running
the plasma generator,

11:15.745 --> 11:17.213
and he was splicing a cable.

11:17.247 --> 11:18.798
- Who was?
- Thatcher.

11:18.832 --> 11:20.133
- Okay.
- And just--

11:20.167 --> 11:22.218
after Sid,
and then after Akley,

11:22.252 --> 11:24.053
and this whole stupid war--

11:24.087 --> 11:25.805
Fritz, slow down.
Calm down.

11:25.839 --> 11:27.223
It could have been me
hooking up that wire.

11:27.257 --> 11:29.225
We couldn't wake him up.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.227
We couldn't wake him up.
He was choking on his tongue.

11:31.261 --> 11:33.229
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

11:33.263 --> 11:35.765
I don't know. It's just
everything is so fragile.

11:35.816 --> 11:37.600
Just life, I mean. I--

11:37.651 --> 11:39.602
I can't go to Jupiter!

11:39.653 --> 11:41.070
Who am I kidding?
I can't even--

11:41.104 --> 11:42.822
What are you saying, Fritz?

11:42.856 --> 11:45.074
What I'm saying is just--

11:46.008 --> 11:47.443
Is that a decoder ring?

11:47.445 --> 11:50.446
I know that I'm no war hero

11:50.448 --> 11:53.449
or even brave,

11:53.451 --> 11:58.171
and I have
sciatica, and--

11:58.205 --> 12:00.456
I do!

12:00.458 --> 12:01.841
- I mean--
- What do you mean?

12:01.875 --> 12:04.093
I mean, um--

12:04.127 --> 12:05.845
- I will.
- You will?

12:05.879 --> 12:07.296
Yeah.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.315
Robert Oppenheimer's
having an affair.

12:27.818 --> 12:29.619
What?

12:30.153 --> 12:32.121
Three days a week he calls
a woman in San Francisco.

12:32.155 --> 12:34.657
A doctor. He's going to
visit her this weekend.

12:34.659 --> 12:36.909
He's going to
Washington, D.C.

12:41.715 --> 12:44.133
- Jesus, Abby.
- What?

12:44.167 --> 12:47.136
You told me no one's supposed
to listen to his calls.

12:47.170 --> 12:50.330
Imagine you're me, sitting at
a switchboard day after day

12:50.340 --> 12:52.621
knowing what none
of the other girls know.

12:53.260 --> 12:56.345
Abby, remember
what killed the cat?

12:58.015 --> 13:00.516
Stay out of other
people's marriages.

13:07.390 --> 13:09.525
Do you remember the first
thing you ever said to me

13:09.559 --> 13:11.360
at the registrar's office
in Chicago?

13:11.394 --> 13:13.529
I remember you had
food in your teeth.

13:13.563 --> 13:15.123
- And you told me.
- Yeah.

13:15.148 --> 13:16.732
All my life, I felt like
I was walking around

13:16.734 --> 13:18.901
with food in my teeth, and
no one would ever tell me.

13:18.952 --> 13:21.537
But you have been
my majordomo ever since.

13:21.571 --> 13:23.372
- A majordomo is a butler.
- I--

13:23.406 --> 13:25.374
Are you getting all
misty-eyed on me?

13:25.408 --> 13:28.144
Is this about
Thatcher's accident?

13:28.178 --> 13:30.129
It's about me and Jeannie.

13:30.163 --> 13:32.748
Holy shit.
You did it!

13:32.750 --> 13:34.550
What did she say?

13:34.584 --> 13:36.552
You want to be the best man?

13:36.586 --> 13:38.754
Ah!

13:38.756 --> 13:40.923
Guys. Guys!

13:40.974 --> 13:43.392
They just posted
the roster for G group.

13:43.426 --> 13:45.761
None of us made the list
except for you, Fritz.

13:45.763 --> 13:46.929
Wait, wait. Me?

13:46.980 --> 13:48.764
- Yeah.
- Ah, so what?

13:48.766 --> 13:50.766
You want to answer directly
to Charlie Isaacs?

13:50.768 --> 13:52.935
I'd rather report to a guy
who reports to a guy

13:52.986 --> 13:54.770
who only has to see his
pretty-boy face once a month.

13:54.772 --> 13:57.156
I mean, we practically
invented implosion.

13:57.190 --> 13:58.607
G group's going to test it.

13:58.609 --> 14:00.576
The culmination
of 300 years of physics

14:00.610 --> 14:01.944
and we're going to
be sitting here

14:01.995 --> 14:03.779
polishing our slide rules.

14:03.814 --> 14:06.582
I'm not joining any group
without you guys.

14:06.616 --> 14:08.167
There's more to life.

14:08.201 --> 14:09.668
Like what?

14:10.787 --> 14:12.171
Go tell her.

14:12.205 --> 14:13.789
- Oh, you're right.
- Just go.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.292
Helen! Wait up!
Wait up! Wait up!

14:35.813 --> 14:39.114
Sir?
I'm sorry to interrupt.

14:40.149 --> 14:41.784
What is that on your face?

14:42.318 --> 14:43.478
I know it's against protocol,

14:43.486 --> 14:44.987
but I have a rash.

14:45.038 --> 14:47.156
I will shave right away, sir.

14:47.158 --> 14:50.159
You look like Paul
on the road to Damascus.

14:54.021 --> 14:55.271
Keep it.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.001
Yes, sir.

14:59.052 --> 15:01.503
But, sir, um,
we found the reporter.

15:01.555 --> 15:03.839
Or he found us.

15:11.681 --> 15:14.567
Ah, W.D. Lorentzen.

15:14.601 --> 15:17.236
I see my reputation
precedes me.

15:17.270 --> 15:18.654
Listen, I don't suppose
you could spare

15:18.688 --> 15:20.856
a soft drink
from one of those tents?

15:20.858 --> 15:22.658
I had to walk the last mile.

15:22.692 --> 15:24.410
The taxi driver wouldn't
bring me any closer.

15:24.444 --> 15:27.863
I was under the impression
you preferred hard drinks.

15:27.865 --> 15:29.865
That you preferred them
to employment

15:29.867 --> 15:31.333
at your last three
newspapers.

15:31.368 --> 15:35.504
I see my reputation
does precede me.

15:35.538 --> 15:38.257
Okay, then.
No refreshments.

15:38.291 --> 15:39.842
Shall we talk Frank Winter?

15:39.876 --> 15:43.045
Whoever referred you
here was misinformed.

15:43.096 --> 15:46.382
Aw, shucks. This was the
last stop on the caboose.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.601
It's the oddest thing.

15:48.635 --> 15:52.888
It seems that half of America's
physicists have just disappeared.

15:52.890 --> 15:56.358
Poof. Like the Rapture.

15:56.393 --> 16:01.196
I imagine you've read the code of wartime
practices for the American press.

16:01.731 --> 16:04.700
I'm really more
of a First Amendment guy.

16:04.734 --> 16:07.703
See, my theory, American's
missing geniuses

16:07.737 --> 16:09.738
are camped right on the
other side of that fence.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.790
And whatever they're up to,

16:11.825 --> 16:14.877
you don't want the Krauts or my
readership knowing about it.

16:14.911 --> 16:17.296
So before you call in
the cavalry,

16:17.330 --> 16:19.081
you should know
that if my editor

16:19.132 --> 16:21.083
doesn't hear from me
by press time,

16:21.134 --> 16:23.969
there will be a special
feature in tomorrow's paper.

16:24.004 --> 16:27.423
A treasure map leading
right to your doorstep.

16:27.974 --> 16:29.308
So tell me,

16:29.542 --> 16:34.129
does the name Frank Winter
ring a bell after all?

16:38.151 --> 16:40.185
Why don't we go get you
that soft drink?

16:41.771 --> 16:43.155
Yeah.

16:44.774 --> 16:46.325
<i>Attention, please.</i>

16:46.359 --> 16:48.577
<i>All vehicles entering
the motor pool</i>

16:48.611 --> 16:51.780
<i>must show updated vehicle
passes before security parking.</i>

17:26.665 --> 17:27.965
Liza.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.680
Did they tell you
anything about Frank?

17:30.218 --> 17:31.669
I was just about
to come find you.

17:32.071 --> 17:33.955
Are they bringing him back?

17:35.407 --> 17:36.958
You see the irony
here, right?

17:36.992 --> 17:40.211
I mean, you're asking
me to risk my hide

17:40.245 --> 17:43.581
so that you can be reunited
with your husband?

17:43.583 --> 17:47.051
Look, I don't think he's going to be
coming around the mountain any time soon.

17:48.385 --> 17:49.570
I tried.

17:53.008 --> 17:54.592
They bought you off.

17:57.012 --> 18:00.982
Let's say you're testing
a theory about hydrangeas

18:01.016 --> 18:03.768
and the theory
doesn't pan out.

18:03.819 --> 18:06.437
But in the course
of experimenting

18:06.488 --> 18:08.773
you find, I don't know,

18:08.824 --> 18:12.493
that plants are sentient
and crave human blood.

18:12.528 --> 18:16.781
Now, are you going to go back

18:16.832 --> 18:19.617
and start over
with the hydrangeas or--

18:19.619 --> 18:22.286
They sold you the scoop
on the gadget.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.024
Is that what
Frank's life is worth?

18:29.294 --> 18:31.629
I've been hired to write
the official chronicle

18:31.631 --> 18:34.015
of the Manhattan
Engineering District.

18:34.049 --> 18:35.933
Unfettered access.

18:35.968 --> 18:38.436
Did you tell him who gave you
the tip-off about Frank?

18:38.470 --> 18:40.021
I would never
reveal a source,

18:40.055 --> 18:41.806
even under penalty
of torture,

18:41.857 --> 18:43.441
which, by the way,
I don't put past

18:43.475 --> 18:45.726
that sadist
of a colonel out there.

18:48.313 --> 18:51.866
They don't give out
Pulitzers for propaganda.

18:59.324 --> 19:02.460
I didn't know
the Allmans had moved.

19:02.494 --> 19:05.296
And in their place you found
a long-lost college chum.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.797
Imagine my surprise.

19:06.832 --> 19:08.466
Yet it wasn't just a campus

19:08.500 --> 19:10.835
you shared with
Mr. Lorentzen was it?

19:10.837 --> 19:12.303
I wonder how
your husband would feel

19:12.337 --> 19:14.221
about your recent visit
with an old flame.

19:14.256 --> 19:16.173
Let's call him and ask.

19:16.175 --> 19:17.642
Then again,
I'm old-fashioned

19:17.676 --> 19:19.316
when it comes to
the sanctity of marriage.

19:19.344 --> 19:20.978
Your husband,
on the other hand,

19:21.013 --> 19:22.847
holds a more
progressive view.

19:23.849 --> 19:25.016
Where's Frank?

19:25.067 --> 19:27.068
He lied to you,

19:27.102 --> 19:29.487
medicated you
with barbiturates

19:29.521 --> 19:31.489
after philandering
with a woman half his age

19:31.523 --> 19:32.857
and half your intelligence,

19:32.908 --> 19:36.827
and yet you persist
in agitating for his return.

19:36.862 --> 19:39.497
You have a wife,
don't you, Colonel?

19:39.531 --> 19:41.812
She didn't choose
to join you on the Hill?

19:43.535 --> 19:46.337
My wife is not well, but
thank you for your concern.

19:46.371 --> 19:48.255
<i>And if you should vanish
into the desert,</i>

19:48.290 --> 19:51.208
I imagine she would do everything
in her power to find you,

19:51.259 --> 19:52.927
despite your imperfections.

19:52.961 --> 19:55.121
But you didn't do everything
in your power, Dr. Winter.

19:55.130 --> 19:56.380
Your daughter did.

19:58.050 --> 20:00.851
Mr. Lorentzen declined
to name his source,

20:00.886 --> 20:03.387
but the telephone company was
glad to do its patriotic duty

20:03.438 --> 20:05.139
in a time of war.

20:06.141 --> 20:07.725
She's only a child.

20:11.113 --> 20:14.031
The operator is holding
an open line

20:14.066 --> 20:15.399
to your sister's apartment.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.068
Your daughter
is on the other end.

20:17.070 --> 20:19.737
If you want to help
your family,

20:19.739 --> 20:22.323
you're going to tell her
to be a good girl.

20:29.581 --> 20:31.382
The wedding china?

20:31.416 --> 20:33.584
We never get
to use it anymore.

20:33.586 --> 20:35.136
What do I call him?

20:35.170 --> 20:37.338
Dr. Oppenheimer
or Robert?

20:39.174 --> 20:40.424
I told you to stay out of it.

20:40.475 --> 20:41.809
It didn't mean
invite him over.

20:41.843 --> 20:43.811
Careers aren't made
between 9:00 and 5:00,

20:43.845 --> 20:46.313
they're made between
soup and dessert.

20:48.350 --> 20:50.151
- Honey.
- Mm?

20:50.185 --> 20:52.436
This has nothing to do
with my career...

20:53.781 --> 20:55.296
...and you know it.

21:01.613 --> 21:05.583
Meeks had one task-- to find a
projector for the stag film.

21:05.617 --> 21:08.002
I found "War Times Tiddlers,"

21:08.036 --> 21:10.755
designed to stiffen the resolve
of our service members.

21:10.789 --> 21:12.790
Well, I found
something way better.

21:12.792 --> 21:15.292
Wollensak Fastax
eight millimeter.

21:15.343 --> 21:18.629
Why just watch a film when
you can shoot your own?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.132
- Right?
- Your own stag film?

21:21.183 --> 21:25.019
No. We were adapting
"Auro, Lord of Jupiter"

21:25.453 --> 21:26.604
from Planet Comics.

21:26.638 --> 21:28.639
It was--
it was gonna be legendary.

21:28.690 --> 21:31.776
And Meeks very graciously
let me play Auro.

21:31.810 --> 21:34.478
And I was Tara, Auro's trusty
saber-toothed tiger friend.

21:34.529 --> 21:36.147
Okay.
Great character.

21:36.149 --> 21:38.482
But alas, Jupiter fell
to the Brits.

21:38.484 --> 21:40.818
This is Fritz's swan song
as a bachelor.

21:40.869 --> 21:43.370
You wanted to spend it
in a burlap diaper.

21:43.405 --> 21:45.956
- Whereas I felt it might be more appropriate--
- Oh!

21:45.991 --> 21:48.325
- Here comes the bride.
- What?

21:50.912 --> 21:52.997
Whoa, no, no, we're not supposed to
see each other before the wedding!

21:53.048 --> 21:56.050
Help! Ah!

21:56.584 --> 21:59.887
I heard it was you that
set up Jeannie and Fritz.

21:59.921 --> 22:02.673
You got any more eligible
bachelors up your sleeve?

22:02.675 --> 22:05.726
Oh, it's not your sleeve
they wanna get up, believe me.

22:06.161 --> 22:08.042
I thought scientists
might be different.

22:08.063 --> 22:10.514
You must be new around here.

22:16.938 --> 22:20.357
Paul Crosley. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

22:22.194 --> 22:23.911
What pleasure is that?

22:23.945 --> 22:25.362
Well, why don't you name
a few of your favorites

22:25.364 --> 22:27.581
and we could try them all?

22:39.211 --> 22:41.045
Cheers.

22:43.598 --> 22:45.633
So you're, uh--
you're new around here?

22:58.730 --> 23:02.283
Did you kill that bed
sheet yourself or what?

23:04.904 --> 23:06.954
It's all I ever want.

23:06.988 --> 23:09.907
Meat, meat, meat.
Robert says it's the iron.

23:09.909 --> 23:12.877
- Mm.
- What about you, Abby? Any cravings?

23:12.911 --> 23:16.213
Oh, it's usually just whatever
they're out of at the commissary.

23:16.248 --> 23:18.549
Oh, the commissary's
a disaster.

23:18.583 --> 23:21.943
You should see the shopping list I
foist on Robert when he's traveling.

23:24.306 --> 23:26.640
You do a lot of traveling,
don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?

23:28.760 --> 23:30.644
If I spent any more time
riding the rails,

23:30.679 --> 23:32.763
they'd make me
a Pullman porter.

23:34.149 --> 23:36.267
I suppose it's just
Washington mostly

23:36.269 --> 23:38.149
- when the president says jump.
<i>-  Abby.</i>

23:38.604 --> 23:40.104
National security.

23:40.155 --> 23:42.907
He's heading there first
thing in the morning again.

23:43.841 --> 23:45.609
I haven't been off the Hill
in almost a year.

23:45.660 --> 23:48.946
I suppose I'm just trying to live vicariously
through someone else's adventures.

23:48.997 --> 23:50.915
If Washington is your idea
of an adventure,

23:50.949 --> 23:53.117
I'm afraid cabin fever is
the least of your problems.

23:53.168 --> 23:55.286
Ah.

24:00.175 --> 24:01.959
How did the two of you meet?

24:02.010 --> 24:03.844
You're so perfectly matched.

24:04.379 --> 24:07.431
Well, I had just married
my third husband.

24:07.465 --> 24:09.633
Of course, Robert isn't the
type to steal a man's wife,

24:09.635 --> 24:11.969
so I reeled him in
the old-fashioned way--

24:11.971 --> 24:13.604
I got pregnant.

24:13.638 --> 24:15.272
This one is just
for good measure.

24:20.478 --> 24:21.779
What a fascinating necktie.

24:21.813 --> 24:24.031
Is that Aladdin?

24:24.065 --> 24:27.618
My uncle saw his first wife
right before the wedding

24:27.652 --> 24:29.536
and then she fell off
a lake steamer

24:29.571 --> 24:31.372
on their way to Niagara Falls
for their honeymoon,

24:31.406 --> 24:34.491
so I'm just saying
I don't wanna risk it.

24:34.542 --> 24:35.659
Cros?

24:35.710 --> 24:37.378
Hello?

24:37.412 --> 24:39.797
Cros?
Crosley, are you there?

24:39.831 --> 24:43.167
- Anyone? Hello?
- Hey, forget about me, Fritzy.

24:43.169 --> 24:46.887
This is... Gloria.

24:46.922 --> 24:49.006
I hear you're from Jupiter.

24:49.008 --> 24:52.009
She's all paid up. And let's consider
this an early wedding present.

24:52.060 --> 24:55.980
One more proper goring before the
old bull head's out to pasture.

24:56.014 --> 24:57.898
Huh?

24:57.933 --> 25:00.184
- Why don't you take the night off?
- Hey, wait.

25:00.186 --> 25:03.270
- Thanks, Gloria.
- Prins. Hey. Hey!

25:05.523 --> 25:08.025
Well, now you owe me
$2 and a half.

25:08.076 --> 25:10.160
What is wrong with you?
Why won't you be happy

25:10.195 --> 25:12.529
till everybody else is as depraved
and miserable as you are?

25:12.531 --> 25:15.032
Says the girl who's been
crying into her cups

25:15.034 --> 25:17.201
because Isaacs left her
off his precious list.

25:17.252 --> 25:19.253
Suddenly you're the
protectoress of marriage?

25:19.287 --> 25:21.755
You think I would've made
a good wife, Paul?

25:22.757 --> 25:24.208
Huh?

25:24.759 --> 25:26.093
I didn't love you.

25:28.296 --> 25:30.431
- I'm sorry.
- Let's not delude ourselves, tulip.

25:30.465 --> 25:32.383
Love didn't enter
the equation.

25:32.385 --> 25:35.102
You traded up for the prince
of the project.

25:35.136 --> 25:37.604
And look where it got you.

25:37.639 --> 25:39.920
I mean, I've heard of birds
sleeping their way to the top,

25:39.941 --> 25:43.477
but you're the first I know who
slept their way to the bottom.

25:53.989 --> 25:57.624
<i> There's a tract in the Mojave
Desert that meets all the criteria--</i>

25:57.659 --> 25:59.910
flat as a pancake,
remote enough

25:59.961 --> 26:02.212
that no one's gonna wander
in with a picnic blanket.

26:02.247 --> 26:03.831
No Indians.

26:05.917 --> 26:07.634
Or if you don't like
California,

26:07.669 --> 26:10.587
there's the Gulf Coast,
Padre Island.

26:10.638 --> 26:13.640
We're testing a weapon of war,
not building a summer house.

26:14.926 --> 26:18.429
We identified
a site in Colorado.

26:18.431 --> 26:20.431
Two in New Mexico.

26:20.433 --> 26:23.100
The Jornada
del Muerto Desert.

26:23.102 --> 26:24.862
- It means--
- "Route of the dead man."

26:26.187 --> 26:27.738
Pick one.

26:27.772 --> 26:30.691
You're the director
of G group. Direct.

26:33.361 --> 26:36.246
I spent all day licking my wounds
wondering what was wrong with me,

26:36.281 --> 26:38.949
-<i> why I didn't make your idiotic group.</i>
- Helen, calm down.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.668
And then I realized
it's not me, it's you.

26:47.342 --> 26:50.594
It is chilly in here,
isn't it?

26:50.628 --> 26:52.796
And you left me on the bench because
you can't control your hard-on?

26:52.798 --> 26:54.465
Go home, you're drunk.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.633
- Thank your wife for dinner.
- And you!

26:56.635 --> 26:59.019
Everybody knows you were the third
choice to run this project.

26:59.054 --> 27:00.971
None of us would
even be here if Frank

27:00.973 --> 27:03.140
hadn't convinced Albert Einstein
we needed a bomb.

27:03.142 --> 27:05.943
- This entire project exists because of Frank.
- Helen. Hey.

27:05.977 --> 27:09.146
- What are you doing?
- Where is he now?

27:09.197 --> 27:12.983
I had to work 10 times harder
than any man to get here.

27:15.069 --> 27:16.954
It was just sex, Charlie.

27:16.988 --> 27:18.238
Get over it.

27:20.708 --> 27:24.161
Hey, I picked the best
team for the job.

27:29.834 --> 27:31.802
Remind me of her name.

27:37.842 --> 27:40.511
She's just a colleague
from the tech area.

27:40.513 --> 27:42.930
- They never stop working, do they?
- Mm.

27:50.071 --> 27:53.991
Honestly, Charlie and I are
happier than we've ever been.

27:54.025 --> 27:57.027
You know, with the baby
and everything.

28:00.198 --> 28:03.367
Men always think they want a woman
who really understands them,

28:03.369 --> 28:05.536
but when they get one,
they learn

28:05.538 --> 28:09.373
what a terrible burden
it is to be known.

28:19.551 --> 28:23.220
Your husband's not going
to Washington tomorrow.

28:23.271 --> 28:26.223
Oh, the Army is always changing
Robert's schedule at the last minute.

28:27.274 --> 28:29.776
He's going to San Francisco.

28:35.150 --> 28:37.901
You work the switchboard,
don't you?

28:39.621 --> 28:42.739
Well, I bet you overhear
all kinds of secrets.

28:44.576 --> 28:46.743
I hear things, too.

28:46.745 --> 28:49.580
I hear you like
the taste of girls.

28:51.416 --> 28:55.135
I do not need marital advice

28:55.170 --> 28:56.837
from a deviant.

29:04.846 --> 29:07.764
Oh, wow.

29:07.815 --> 29:10.184
Wow. Oh.

29:24.199 --> 29:27.251
Oh, God, uh, was I
not supposed to...?

29:27.285 --> 29:30.287
- Um, sorry.
- You did great.

29:30.338 --> 29:32.756
You did great. Wow.

29:32.790 --> 29:34.124
You're a pro.

29:34.126 --> 29:35.926
Well, I mean--

29:35.960 --> 29:38.095
I'm not saying
that, uh--

29:38.129 --> 29:40.297
<i>I mean, you're not
obviously, uh--</i>

29:40.299 --> 29:42.683
<i>you're not a pro
in that sense.</i>

29:42.717 --> 29:46.803
But wait, you're-- you're
not a pro, are you?

29:46.854 --> 29:50.190
I've, uh-- I've never been asked if I
was a hooker on a first date before.

29:50.225 --> 29:52.476
Oh, God, no, well,

29:52.478 --> 29:54.444
I'm sorry, I--
I didn't mean--

29:54.479 --> 29:56.313
it's just--
it's just, uh,

29:56.364 --> 29:58.148
a lot of the nice girls here,

29:58.199 --> 30:00.200
like Jeannie,
they sometimes--

30:00.235 --> 30:03.620
um-- wait,
are we on a date?

30:03.655 --> 30:05.322
Yeah, sort of.

30:05.373 --> 30:07.991
'Cause we could go on one.

30:07.993 --> 30:09.993
I mean, like a--
a regular one,

30:10.044 --> 30:12.379
like to the theater.

30:12.413 --> 30:15.132
Do you like the theater?

30:15.166 --> 30:19.503
"Young Cassius has a lean
and hungry look.

30:19.554 --> 30:21.805
He thinks too much.

30:21.839 --> 30:24.808
Such men are dangerous."

30:24.842 --> 30:27.561
Wow, you can recite
Shakespeare?

30:28.713 --> 30:29.870
Next you're gonna tell me

30:29.897 --> 30:33.267
you have a copy of Planet Comics
number one in your purse.

30:49.751 --> 30:51.418
Jim.

30:54.789 --> 30:56.873
Jim.

31:08.834 --> 31:12.302
Just a-- I'll be out
in a second.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.385
You gonna ask a girl in?

31:32.724 --> 31:34.224
You should take up smoking.

31:34.275 --> 31:36.693
Covers the smell
of burnt papers.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.896
Did they teach you
that in spy school

31:38.947 --> 31:41.732
along with the use of fellatio
as a tool of persuasion?

31:41.783 --> 31:44.785
No. That I learned
in high school.

31:47.288 --> 31:50.574
Did you want me to apologize

31:50.625 --> 31:52.743
for the blowjob?

31:52.794 --> 31:56.246
I want you to go back
to wherever they found you.

31:56.297 --> 31:58.465
I found them, same as you.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.716
Oh, no.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.135
We are not the same.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.255
The class struggle uses whatever
human material is available

32:05.257 --> 32:07.758
- to fulfill its objectives.
- I'm not a Communist.

32:07.809 --> 32:09.593
I only reached out
to your associates

32:09.595 --> 32:12.095
because the Army
shot my friend.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.932
<i>The Oriental.</i>

32:14.983 --> 32:17.401
- I read your file.
- His name was Sid.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.320
Do you think that they
would have killed Sid

32:20.355 --> 32:22.105
if he'd looked like you?

32:22.756 --> 32:24.658
If you're not a Communist,

32:24.692 --> 32:27.444
why are you risking your own
neck to give them a bomb?

32:27.446 --> 32:30.614
Not a bomb, the bomb.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.916
It's-- it's the queen.

32:33.951 --> 32:35.335
Do you--

32:35.370 --> 32:38.622
do you ever play chess?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.791
The queen is the most powerful
piece on the chessboard.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.260
That's what we're
building here

32:43.294 --> 32:47.297
for an army that shoots its own citizens.

32:47.948 --> 32:50.100
<i>If we are the only ones
who have it,</i>

32:50.134 --> 32:52.519
we'll probably blow up
the world.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.354
But if--

32:54.389 --> 32:57.357
if Stalin has a bomb
in his pocket, too,

32:57.392 --> 32:59.610
the game ends in a draw.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.362
It's a stalemate.
Nobody dies.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.818
I was trying to do
the right thing.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.620
No, you were.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.990
- You still are.
- Really?

33:13.041 --> 33:17.044
Didn't feel that way when I was shoving
a body in the trunk of a Buick.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.829
What?

33:18.880 --> 33:21.164
Did they leave that detail
out of my file?

33:21.215 --> 33:23.500
Hmm? Your comrade
killed a guy

33:23.551 --> 33:25.052
two feet away from me.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.888
<i>Now I can't sleep at night.</i>

33:35.513 --> 33:37.731
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.850
It was military intelligence.
It doesn't matter.

33:39.852 --> 33:42.352
I'm all through with
the class struggle.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.359
They're expecting
weekly reports

33:49.361 --> 33:51.528
and I'm supposed
to deliver them.

33:51.579 --> 33:54.019
Yeah, well, I hope they
don't shoot the messenger.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.035
You don't get it.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.337
They killed
a government agent.

34:00.371 --> 34:04.007
What do you think they're gonna
do to a dropout from Pittsburgh

34:04.042 --> 34:07.878
or to a scientist
who's got cold feet?

34:16.437 --> 34:18.221
Even if--

34:18.272 --> 34:20.190
even if I wanted to help,

34:20.224 --> 34:23.025
the project's been
reorganized,

34:23.061 --> 34:25.562
I'm on the C team.
I don't have access anymore.

34:25.612 --> 34:28.114
Not to the kind of
information they want.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.569
Well, you're the genius.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.371
Right?

34:35.005 --> 34:36.790
What are we gonna do?

34:48.753 --> 34:50.670
Hey.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.428
You know, uh,

34:58.430 --> 35:00.897
when Helen Prins showed
up here, that was, uh--

35:00.932 --> 35:03.266
that was about
the test we're planning.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.486
- I promise you have nothing to worry about.
- I know.

35:09.857 --> 35:13.443
Aside from that,
"Mrs. Lincoln,"

35:13.445 --> 35:16.113
it was a lovely evening.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.620
You should have
Robert Oppenheimer's job.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.301
Spy killer on guard duty.

35:39.687 --> 35:42.472
The colonel must be
scared of this broad.

35:44.692 --> 35:47.052
<i>Have fun with
Mrs. Winter.</i>

36:14.444 --> 36:19.644
_

36:28.369 --> 36:31.154
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, trust me.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.692
I got 'em from one
of the Indian maids.

36:35.243 --> 36:38.912
She makes them herself.
This is real silver.

36:40.414 --> 36:42.365
Yeah.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.669
That'll work.

36:45.703 --> 36:50.257
You got any last advice
before I walk the plank?

36:51.876 --> 36:54.878
Uh, well, um,

36:55.380 --> 36:57.547
yes, as a matter of fact.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.382
Um...

37:03.804 --> 37:06.023
You should take the
assignment with G group.

37:06.574 --> 37:08.892
It doesn't matter what you
think of Charlie Isaacs.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.611
This test--

37:11.646 --> 37:15.448
this test is the start
of a whole new era.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.869
This is like Auro's
interplanetary cruise ship

37:18.903 --> 37:20.987
crash-landing
on Jupiter.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.707
I don't know, I--

37:23.741 --> 37:26.126
I just-- I don't need
the prestige.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.995
- Maybe most guys do, but--
- You have food in your teeth.

37:30.965 --> 37:33.550
I am telling you
the truth, buddy.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.385
No one else is gonna.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.805
You cannot let an opportunity
like this pass you up.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.594
I ju-- it's just--

37:45.396 --> 37:47.264
I like working with you.

37:47.266 --> 37:49.482
I wouldn't know
what to do without you.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.936
That's, um--

37:52.938 --> 37:56.606
that's why you're gonna convince
Isaacs to put me on the team, too.

37:56.657 --> 37:59.109
You know my work.
He'll listen to you.

38:00.828 --> 38:02.996
Let's go to Jupiter together.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.501
Bombs away.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.671
Bombs away.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.843
Well, here we go.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.263
Crosley, wait up.

38:20.598 --> 38:23.600
Whoo!

38:26.053 --> 38:27.554
<i>Whoo!</i>

38:57.547 --> 39:01.166
Do you have any idea what kind
of a man you're working for?

39:03.002 --> 39:04.903
You say you love Callie?

39:06.339 --> 39:08.620
This is quite a way
of showing it.

39:11.010 --> 39:13.562
Callie drove to Canada
this morning with her aunt.

39:13.846 --> 39:16.097
She's safe.

39:20.102 --> 39:22.471
You spoke to her?

39:22.523 --> 39:24.489
Colonel lets me use his
phone to talk to my folks

39:24.524 --> 39:26.742
when he's out and no one
monitors the line.

39:29.245 --> 39:32.748
What other perks do you
get for turning me in?

39:37.704 --> 39:40.839
- Crystal City, Texas.
- What's that?

39:41.873 --> 39:43.792
Your next plum assignment?

39:45.545 --> 39:47.763
It's where they're keeping
your husband.

39:51.217 --> 39:54.386
And why should I take
your word for that?

39:55.972 --> 39:57.556
You don't have to.

39:59.392 --> 40:02.227
I can get you as far
as the Lamy train depot.

40:14.958 --> 40:17.409
All right.
You're good to go.

40:17.411 --> 40:19.571
- Have a good evening.
-<i> You have a good night.</i>

40:38.934 --> 40:41.934
_

41:00.169 --> 41:02.089
<i>It's called dance therapy.</i>

41:03.321 --> 41:04.956
When we're focused
on our feet,

41:04.958 --> 41:06.591
we're distracted
from our brains.

41:06.626 --> 41:08.760
The body is spinning,
the mind is still.

41:08.795 --> 41:11.179
My wife doesn't need
waltzing lessons.

41:11.214 --> 41:13.682
It's been three months.
I've yet to hear a diagnosis,

41:13.716 --> 41:15.517
much less a prognosis.

41:15.551 --> 41:17.853
It's fascinating, really.

41:17.887 --> 41:21.223
- The science is so new.
- Psychiatry, is it a science?

41:22.975 --> 41:25.455
Dr. Winter, would you like
to discuss this privately?

41:25.478 --> 41:28.647
- No, I wouldn't.
- The treatment takes time, Frank.

41:28.649 --> 41:30.949
Yes, but do you feel better?

41:30.983 --> 41:33.201
Every week
you're less yourself.

41:33.236 --> 41:35.821
Self is a fluid concept.

41:35.872 --> 41:38.790
- Often in the first year of treatment--
- The first year?

41:38.825 --> 41:40.709
I can understand

41:40.743 --> 41:43.161
why certainties would be appealing
to a man in your field.

41:43.212 --> 41:46.498
Isn't there a superego somewhere that
requires your attention, Doctor?

41:48.501 --> 41:50.335
Would you come with me
right now?

41:50.337 --> 41:52.220
We've barely begun
the psychoanalysis.

41:52.255 --> 41:55.841
- We have a lot of work to do.
- Your work is out there.

41:55.892 --> 41:59.010
- Dr. Winter, perhaps we might look at a--
- We can leave Ithaca.

41:59.012 --> 42:01.346
- We can make a fresh start.
- Have you been fired again?

42:01.348 --> 42:03.648
Any sudden change at this
stage of her treatment--

42:03.683 --> 42:06.017
In the last month, I have
fielded recruiting calls

42:06.069 --> 42:08.070
from three universities.

42:08.104 --> 42:10.522
My vote is Princeton,
but it's your decision.

42:10.524 --> 42:12.157
It's your career.

42:12.191 --> 42:14.576
Liza, they're recruiting you.

42:16.529 --> 42:20.198
- Liza.
- Princeton will give you a dedicated lab.

42:20.200 --> 42:24.369
Dr. Winter, let's continue
this discussion in my office.

42:24.371 --> 42:26.588
It's not you that's sick.

42:26.622 --> 42:28.957
It's this place.

42:34.464 --> 42:37.048
<i>And don't forget we
have the Friedmans at 6:00.</i>

42:37.050 --> 42:39.217
<i>I know it's downtown,
but I don't wanna hear it.</i>

42:39.219 --> 42:41.720
Not after you dragged me to Bensonhurst
for that supper last week.

42:45.725 --> 42:47.359
You with a beard.

42:47.393 --> 42:49.561
Now that's something
I'll never cotton to.

42:51.064 --> 42:53.565
Office hours are
Mondays at 4:00.

42:54.116 --> 42:55.856
I'm afraid it can't wait.

43:01.741 --> 43:04.075
Oh!

43:04.077 --> 43:05.911
Good to see you, Glen.

43:05.962 --> 43:08.880
I'd ask how on earth,

43:08.915 --> 43:10.582
but I don't want to know.

43:11.834 --> 43:14.252
Miriam, this is
Dr. Liza Winter.

43:14.303 --> 43:18.423
We were on the same
scientific retreat last year.

43:18.425 --> 43:19.975
In Quebec.

43:20.009 --> 43:22.477
I hope you fared better
than Glen in all that snow.

43:22.812 --> 43:25.263
Worse, actually.

43:25.265 --> 43:27.065
Miriam, would you
give us a minute?

43:27.099 --> 43:29.317
It was nice to meet you.

43:35.290 --> 43:36.541
That's my companion.

43:37.376 --> 43:40.078
- The provost's sister.
- Oh.

43:40.512 --> 43:43.398
Seems as though you
landed on your feet.

43:44.622 --> 43:45.951
Don't be fooled.

43:45.953 --> 43:47.836
The pyramids look grand, too,

43:47.870 --> 43:49.788
but they're still tombs.

43:49.839 --> 43:53.199
Every physicist worth a title is
back where we both came from.

43:53.226 --> 43:55.161
Glen...

43:56.795 --> 43:58.180
Frank's in trouble.

44:00.016 --> 44:02.300
Heavy is the head, eh?

44:02.351 --> 44:05.437
What, he send you here
to crib my calculus notes?

44:05.471 --> 44:07.806
Frank never took that job.

44:07.857 --> 44:11.276
He disappeared
same time you did.

44:11.310 --> 44:13.945
I think he's in Texas.

44:13.980 --> 44:15.614
What the hell's in Texas?

44:15.648 --> 44:18.817
A Department of Justice
internment camp.

44:23.039 --> 44:26.157
Look, one thing
I know about Frank,

44:26.159 --> 44:29.661
he always manages to find a
chair when the music stops.

44:29.712 --> 44:32.380
This one might be
electrified.

44:34.667 --> 44:38.503
Helping your husband is what
landed me back here in purgatory.

44:38.505 --> 44:41.006
There are things that
you don't know, Liza.

44:41.008 --> 44:43.141
I know that Frank dragged
me across that desert

44:43.175 --> 44:45.575
so that you two could
build an atomic bomb.

44:47.346 --> 44:49.397
Is there anything else?

44:53.269 --> 44:54.587
I'm sorry.

44:55.521 --> 44:57.189
A long time ago,

44:58.524 --> 45:01.393
I was stuck in a place
that I didn't belong.

45:01.527 --> 45:03.862
I almost forgot who I was

45:03.864 --> 45:05.747
and then Frank remembered.

45:05.781 --> 45:09.034
Whatever happened between
you two, whatever he did,

45:09.085 --> 45:10.869
that is not him.

45:10.920 --> 45:15.040
That place, that bomb turned
him into someone else.

45:20.046 --> 45:22.931
I don't have any
strings left to pull.

45:26.218 --> 45:27.886
What would Frank do?

45:50.293 --> 45:52.243
He's expecting you.

46:12.181 --> 46:13.932
Dr. Einstein.

46:15.601 --> 46:17.819
I believe you know
my husband.
