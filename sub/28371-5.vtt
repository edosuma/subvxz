WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.350
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.393 --> 00:04.047
I THINK WE DESERVE
A FRESH START.

00:04.091 --> 00:05.353
DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN GO TO SCHOOL?

00:05.396 --> 00:06.528
NO, MADI.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.095
NO ONE'S GONNA FIND OUT
I'M A NIGHTBLOOD.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.792
RUSSELL:
TODAY WE MARK THE RETURN

00:09.835 --> 00:11.141
OF OUR BELOVED PRIYA...

00:11.185 --> 00:13.317
DELILAH JANICE WORKMAN,
DO YOU ACCEPT THIS HONOR?

00:13.361 --> 00:14.623
I DO.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.147
RUSSELL: IT IS MY GREAT
HONOR TO PRESENT PRIYA.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.237
DELILAH.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.066
OCTAVIA: THEIR LEADER
IS SOME OLD MAN.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.241
DIYOZA:
IF I KILL HIM...

00:24.285 --> 00:25.721
JADE: THE PRIMES
WILL HONOR THE DEAL,

00:25.764 --> 00:27.853
AND THE KING WILL LET YOUR
CHILD BE RAISED IN SANCTUM.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.594
THEN CONSIDER IT DONE.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.248
RUSSELL: I MISS MY DAUGHTER.
WE CAN GET HER BACK TONIGHT.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.380
SIMONE: I'LL PREP FOR INSERTION.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.859
RUSSELL: I'M SORRY, CLARKE.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.731
JOSEPHINE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:36.906 --> 00:40.257
-YOU'RE SAFE. BREATHE.
-DAD?

00:46.220 --> 00:49.527
KAYLEE: IT'S LATE.
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.181
ROSE WAS KILLED,

00:51.225 --> 00:55.142
BUT JADE RETURNED
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

00:55.185 --> 00:55.272
OH, THANK GOD.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.363
FIRST...

00:59.407 --> 01:01.017
TELL US THE TRUTH.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.932
SIMONE: THERE'S A RUMOR THAT
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY

01:02.975 --> 01:04.847
WERE RUNNING AWAY WHEN YOU
WENT UP TO THE EARTH SHIP.

01:04.890 --> 01:08.242
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WHY WOULD WE RUN AWAY?

01:08.285 --> 01:10.287
WHO TOLD YOU THIS?

01:10.331 --> 01:12.333
I DID.

01:13.769 --> 01:14.987
YOU WOULD TAKE THE
WORD OF A STRANGER

01:15.031 --> 01:17.033
OVER ME?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.601
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LEE-LEE?

01:19.644 --> 01:22.604
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

01:22.647 --> 01:25.215
JOSEPHINE?

01:25.259 --> 01:27.783
SURPRISE.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.828
I HEARD
THAT YOU WERE THE ONE

01:29.872 --> 01:33.963
TO FIND MY LAST BODY
AFTER MY TRAGIC FALL.

01:43.277 --> 01:44.452
ENGLISH, PLEASE.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323
SHE KILLED SOMEONE
I CARED FOR.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.717
I WAS PROTECTING
SANCTUM...

01:48.760 --> 01:51.154
FROM YOU.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.374
SO AM I.

01:53.417 --> 01:56.203
SIMONE: NO!
RUSSELL: JOSEPHINE!

01:56.246 --> 01:57.726
YOURS WAS THE LAST
FACE I SAW

01:57.769 --> 02:00.163
BEFORE I FELL.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.644
NOW WE'RE EVEN.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.256
I KNOW WE HAVE
A LOT TO DISCUSS,

02:06.300 --> 02:08.867
BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT
TO HAVE A SHOWER,

02:08.911 --> 02:11.827
GET OUT OF
THIS HIDEOUS DRESS.

02:55.131 --> 02:58.395
MAN: ♪ ALORS ON DANSE

02:58.874 --> 03:02.921
WOMAN AND MAN:
♪ ALORS ON DANSE

03:02.965 --> 03:06.273
♪ ALORS ON DANSE

03:07.317 --> 03:08.449
♪ ALORS ON DANSE

03:23.159 --> 03:26.206
MAN: ♪ ALORS ON DANSE

03:26.902 --> 03:30.210
WOMAN AND MAN:
♪ ALORS ON DANSE

03:31.123 --> 03:34.910
♪ ALORS ON DANSE

03:34.953 --> 03:38.566
♪ ALORS
ON DANSE... ♪

03:38.609 --> 03:39.001
HEY.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.698
TOO LOUD?

03:40.742 --> 03:43.440
NO.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.225
COME HERE.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.532
YOU DIDN'T
SLEEP, DID YOU?

03:48.576 --> 03:50.621
I NEVER DO
MY FIRST NIGHT BACK.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.275
WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT KAYLEE.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.755
AH, NO, WE DON'T.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.758
HER FAMILY WAS AFRAID THAT
YOU'D FIND OUT SHE KILLED ME.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.281
THAT'S WHY THEY RAN.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.543
A COUPLE OF DECADES ON ICE,

03:59.587 --> 04:01.023
IT'LL TEACH THEM A LESSON.

04:01.066 --> 04:04.809
IT MAY BE CONSIDERABLY
LESS THAN THAT.

04:07.029 --> 04:11.425
THE PEOPLE FROM EARTH?
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE HOSTS?

04:11.468 --> 04:12.469
WE DON'T KNOW.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.254
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND OUT.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.212
OH, NO, NO, NO. NO WAY.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.300
JOSIE.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.736
DID YOU ASK THEM NICELY?

04:18.780 --> 04:20.085
THEY KNOW GABRIEL
TARGETS HOSTS,

04:20.129 --> 04:21.522
SO, OF COURSE THEY
SAID THEY HAD NONE.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.958
MAYBE THEY WERE TELLING
THE TRUTH.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.438
RUSSELL: ALL 13 OF US
HAD THE BLOOD
WHEN WE LANDED.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.309
ODDS ARE THERE ARE
MORE LIKE CLARKE.

04:26.353 --> 04:29.399
IN THE 6 YEARS THAT
I WAS ON ICE,

04:29.443 --> 04:31.575
NOT ONE SINGLE HOST
WAS BORN.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.796
NO ONE. IF YOU'D JUST LET
ME RUN THE BREEDING PROGRAM,

04:34.839 --> 04:37.320
WE WOULDN'T BE FACING
EXTINCTION RIGHT NOW.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.756
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
OBLATION AGAIN.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.323
THOSE ARE OUR PEOPLE--
HUMAN BEINGS--

04:40.367 --> 04:42.673
NOT A HERD OF CATTLE
TO BE CULLED.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.022
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.851
PEACE AND LOVE FOR THE GRACE
AND GLORY OF SANCTUM.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.375
CONSENT IS KEY.
BLAH-DE-BLAH.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.115
TELL ME SOMETHING,

04:50.159 --> 04:51.943
DID THIS FERRARI
I'M WEARING CONSENT

04:51.987 --> 04:53.249
TO GIVING UP HER BODY?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.077
SIMONE: WE BROUGHT YOU BACK
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.644
IT WAS NOW OR MAYBE NEVER.

04:56.687 --> 05:01.475
DO NOT MAKE US REGRET
THAT DECISION.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.914
THESE PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS,
JOSIE.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.872
IF THEY FIND OUT
WE KILLED CLARKE,

05:07.916 --> 05:10.048
THEY WILL BURN THIS
WORLD DOWN

05:10.092 --> 05:12.660
JUST LIKE THEIR LAST ONE.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.446
BLESSED IS JOSEPHINE.
BLESSED ARE THE PRIMES.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.405
JADE WILL BE THERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.928
YOU CAN TELL THEM
WE INSISTED

05:19.971 --> 05:21.582
BECAUSE OF THE
CHILDREN OF GABRIEL.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.974
THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.367
REDEEM YOURSELF FOR
LOSING ROSE.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.370
PROTECT YOUR PRIME
AS IF ALL OUR LIVES
DEPEND ON IT

05:27.414 --> 05:29.154
BECAUSE THEY DO.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.634
RUSSELL: START WITH
HER MOTHER--ABBY.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.027
SHE'S A DOCTOR.

05:32.070 --> 05:35.335
SHE'LL KNOW HOW MANY OF
THEIR PEOPLE HAVE THE BLOOD.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.039
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE ARE, JOSIE.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.520
AND FOR NOW, WE HAVE
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.349
WHY? WHAT WE ARE IS
SPECTACULAR.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.568
THEY WON'T UNDERSTAND.
THEY'LL RUN.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.091
AND WE CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN,

05:53.135 --> 05:54.310
NOT WHEN THEY
COULD BE THE THING

05:54.354 --> 05:56.573
THAT SAVES US.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.585
THANK YOU FOR EXAMINING ME.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.675
I KNOW TODAY IS
DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.765
ROSE WOULD HAVE MADE
A BEAUTIFUL JASMINE.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.593
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

06:16.637 --> 06:17.594
JORDAN: DELILAH.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.509
HE'S ONE OF THE
PEOPLE FROM EARTH,

06:19.553 --> 06:21.163
A FRIEND OF
DELILAH'S.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.469
I MEAN PRIYA.

06:22.512 --> 06:23.905
CASSIUS: IT ISN'T
THE TIME, JORDAN.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.602
I JUST WANT TO GIVE
HER THIS.

06:25.646 --> 06:30.607
YOU SAID THE DAISY
WAS YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.914
IT IS. THANK YOU.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.611
JORDAN, VOICE-OVER:
YESTERDAY SHE TOLD ME

06:34.655 --> 06:37.440
HER FAVORITE FLOWERS WERE
THE CALLA LILIES.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.660
CALLA LILIES ARE NICE.

06:39.703 --> 06:40.443
JORDAN: I'M SERIOUS.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.489
SOMETHING HAPPENED
IN THAT RELIQUARY.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.142
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW ME.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.579
JUST PLAY IT COOL.
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.277
YEAH, THAT AND, LIKE,
MAYBE DON'T GET FLOWERS

06:48.320 --> 06:50.671
FOR A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.940
JOSEPHINE: BELLAMY BLAKE,
JOHN MURPHY,

06:58.983 --> 07:00.332
JORDAN GREEN.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.551
YES, GOOD.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.248
MOTHER ISN'T HERE.
MAYBE WE SHOULD--

07:03.292 --> 07:08.515
RELAX. I PLAYED VLADIMIR
IN "GODOT" TWICE.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.256
HOW HARD CAN CLARKE BE?

07:13.215 --> 07:15.652
CLARKE.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.655
OH! MADI.

07:18.699 --> 07:19.613
GOOD MORNING.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.615
CAN I PLEASE GO
TO SCHOOL TODAY?

07:21.658 --> 07:23.530
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

07:23.573 --> 07:28.273
GAIA: CLARKE! WE
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.756
OH, APPARENTLY, PEOPLE
WITH BLOOD LIKE MINE

07:32.800 --> 07:34.497
ARE A TARGET.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.543
THE PRIMES INSISTED.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.512
UH...

07:49.556 --> 07:51.079
EVERYTHING OK?

07:51.122 --> 07:53.864
YEAH. FINE.
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

07:53.908 --> 07:55.475
ONE OF THE PRIMES IS
SHOWING RAVEN AND EMORI

07:55.518 --> 07:57.477
HOW TO BUILD
A RADIATION SHIELD.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.652
-RYKER?
-YEAH.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.176
I SENT ECHO AND MILLER
TO WATCH THEIR BACKS.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.569
AND MY MOTHER?

08:02.612 --> 08:04.135
STILL IN THE LIBRARY.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.834
JACKSON SAID
HE FOUND HER SLEEPING
WITH HER HEAD ON A BOOK.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.444
SPEAKING OF BOOKS,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.185
LET'S GET YOU TO SCHOOL.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.535
-CLARKE.
-CHILL OUT. SHE'LL BE FINE.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.929
"CHILL OUT"?

08:14.972 --> 08:15.407
-WHAT?
-HUH. NOTHING.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.062
HAPPINESS LOOKS
GOOD ON YOU.

08:18.106 --> 08:21.152
I TAKE IT YOU HAD
FUN WITH THE DOCTOR.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.632
CILLIAN? YEAH.

08:22.676 --> 08:27.289
LET'S JUST SAY IT'LL BE
A WHILE UNTIL HE RECOVERS.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.428
MAN:
HERE YOU GO.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.473
LET'S GO.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.607
THANK YOU FOR
CHANGING YOUR MIND.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.697
WHY DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND?

08:43.740 --> 08:45.437
MAYBE I SHOULD RECONSIDER.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.788
UH, NOPE.
ALL GOOD HERE.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.316
INTERESTING LANGUAGE.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.796
ENGLISH LEXICAL SOURCE.

08:55.839 --> 08:59.016
MAYBE A CREOLE
VIA A PIDGIN STAGE.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.411
COME ON. I KNOW WHERE
THE MOTHER IS.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.677
GAIA...

09:07.721 --> 09:08.504
HEY, SLOW DOWN.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.071
MADI WILL BE FINE.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.769
FINE? THEY GAVE CLARKE
A BODYGUARD FOR BEING
A NIGHTBLOOD,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.118
AND SHE JUST SENDS
MADI TO SCHOOL?

09:14.162 --> 09:16.730
BLYTHE ANN: CAN I GET
YOU GUYS ANYTHING ELSE?

09:16.773 --> 09:19.820
MA'AM, CAN I ASK
YOU SOMETHING?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.605
ONLY IF YOU CALL ME B.A.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.912
JORDAN: WHAT HAPPENED
TO DELILAH LAST NIGHT?

09:24.955 --> 09:27.784
OUR LITTLE GIRL BECAME
ONE WITH THE PRIMES.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.830
YOU WERE THERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.396
BELLAMY:
AH, NOTHING'S WRONG.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.703
SHE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW ME.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.270
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

09:35.313 --> 09:39.100
OH, CHILD, I MISS HER, TOO.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.843
PRIYA'S RETURN
BLESSES US ALL.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.023
"PRIYA'S RETURN
BLESSES US ALL"?

09:49.066 --> 09:50.633
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.853
IT MEANS THAT THEY
BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.

09:52.896 --> 09:56.639
THAT FAITH SHOULD
BE RESPECTED.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.859
JORDAN, WE'RE GUESTS HERE,
AND WE NEED THEIR HELP.

09:58.902 --> 10:03.211
I'M SURE WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND PRIYA--

10:03.254 --> 10:04.516
DELILAH.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.911
IT HAPPENED BETWEEN
ME AND DELILAH.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.134
I KNOW YOU THINK YOU
NEED TO PROTECT US ALL

10:13.177 --> 10:15.876
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
PROTECT OCTAVIA,

10:15.919 --> 10:19.619
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.252
-I HAD HIM!
-DID YOU?

10:44.295 --> 10:46.776
DIYOZA: HE LED US HERE
SO WE'D HAVE TO GO ON FOOT.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.256
OCTAVIA: SO WE'RE
DOING WHAT HE WANTS?

10:48.299 --> 10:50.214
IT'S THAT OR HE GETS
AWAY, AND I DON'T
GET HIS LEADER,

10:50.258 --> 10:52.347
AND MY BABY DOESN'T
GET INTO SANCTUM.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.655
YES, FOR NOW, WE'RE
DOING WHAT HE WANTS.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.449
DIYOZA: WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS STUFF?

11:07.492 --> 11:08.624
XAVIER:
CALL IT YOUR CRUCIBLE.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.846
THE HARDER YOU FIGHT,
THE FASTER YOU DIE.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.546
SON OF A BITCH.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.860
ABBY: THE EXTRACT PULLS EXCESS
CREATINE FROM THE BLOOD.

11:26.903 --> 11:27.817
WE CAN USE THAT.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.037
ABBY, KANE'S KIDNEYS
HAVE FAILED.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.822
HE'LL NEED FULL
HEMODIALYSIS FOR STARTERS.

11:32.866 --> 11:33.693
YOU KNOW THAT.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.390
ABBY: WRONG.
WE'RE GONNA USE

11:35.433 --> 11:36.783
PERITONEAL
DIALYSIS INSTEAD.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.568
HE'S GOT ABDOMINAL BLEEDING.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?

11:39.611 --> 11:40.874
ABBY: I DON'T KNOW!

11:40.917 --> 11:43.398
CLARKE.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.794
SHE HASN'T SLEPT
IN TWO DAYS.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.013
I'M WORRIED
THAT SHE MIGHT RELAPSE.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.885
ABBY: I DON'T WANT DRUGS.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.277
I WANT TO SAVE MARCUS.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.758
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT?

11:55.802 --> 11:56.846
YOU GO.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.414
I'LL TALK TO HER.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.901
IT'S BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.774
I HEARD WHAT YOU GUYS
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.602
THIS MIGHT HELP.

12:13.645 --> 12:14.646
HOW?

12:14.690 --> 12:17.040
YOU SAID HE NEEDS
HEMODIALYSIS.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.955
THIS IS ABOUT
NIGHTBLOOD.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.217
IT'S WORTHLESS.

12:20.261 --> 12:24.004
I ACTUALLY READ A BOOK
BY THAT SAME AUTHOR.

12:24.047 --> 12:27.311
PROPAGANDA ON
A EUGENICS PROJECT--

12:27.355 --> 12:29.009
PURIFYING OF
THE BLOOD LINE.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.446
AND YOU THOUGHT
WHAT WE DID IN
BECCA'S LAB WAS BAD?

12:31.489 --> 12:34.144
I MEAN, THAT WOMAN
WAS A MONSTER.

12:34.188 --> 12:34.275
OR A VISIONARY.

12:35.842 --> 12:40.672
OK, CAN YOU TAKE SOME
NOTES FOR ME, PLEASE?

12:41.586 --> 12:44.459
THE FIBER OF THIS LEAF
CAN DOUBLE

12:44.502 --> 12:45.939
AS A SURGICAL MESH.

12:45.982 --> 12:48.376
AND THE STOMATA IS LARGE
ENOUGH THAT THE WOUND

12:48.419 --> 12:51.292
WOULD BE ABLE
TO BREATHE...

12:53.947 --> 12:55.078
WHAT?

12:55.122 --> 12:57.820
WHY ARE YOU WRITING
WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND?

12:59.430 --> 13:02.303
CLARKE, ARE YOU
FEELING OK?

13:08.875 --> 13:11.312
HERE.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.096
THE LAN HUDIE RHOPALOCERA.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.054
WHAT?

13:14.097 --> 13:15.969
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T DO
DIALYSIS,

13:16.012 --> 13:18.667
THIS GUY METABOLIZES UREA
AND CREATINE.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.713
LOOK, IT SAYS SO
RIGHT THERE.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.762
THAT'S REALLY GOOD!
THAT'S GOOD.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.460
GO GET JACKSON,
PLEASE.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.038
200 YEARS,
THIS IS ALL THEY MAPPED.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.214
WHY LEAVE WHEN
YOU'RE SAFE, RIGHT?

13:44.258 --> 13:45.389
OH, COME ON, MURPHY.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.086
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE
OF ADVENTURE?

13:46.129 --> 13:47.043
WE'RE PIONEERS.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.610
OH, I DON'T WANT
TO BE PIONEERS.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.873
PIONEERS FIND THE RED ZONE
AND WIND UP DEAD

13:50.917 --> 13:52.222
OR GET CAUGHT

13:52.266 --> 13:56.400
IN RANDOMLY-OCCURRING,
PSYCHOSIS-INDUCING ECLIPSES.

13:56.444 --> 14:00.187
YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO THROUGH
THAT AGAIN?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.145
I'VE BEEN ASKING
AROUND.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.973
APPARENTLY, THIS
WHOLE THING'S BUILT

14:04.017 --> 14:05.540
ON TOP OF
CAVE SYSTEMS.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.324
THE BUGS START
TO FREAK OUT,

14:07.368 --> 14:08.891
THE PARTY GOES
UNDERGROUND.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.067
RIGHT. SO WE FIND
OUR OWN CAVE SYSTEM,

14:11.111 --> 14:13.069
RAVEN BUILDS US
A RADIATION SHIELD.

14:13.113 --> 14:17.291
MURPHY, WE CAN'T
STAY HERE FOREVER.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.901
AND EVEN IF WE COULD,

14:18.945 --> 14:20.990
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER 400 OF US?

14:21.034 --> 14:24.037
WOMAN ON P.A.: PLEASE JOIN US
IN THE OFFERING GROUNDS

14:24.080 --> 14:26.778
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO OUR BELOVED ROSE...

14:26.822 --> 14:27.562
ROSE IS BEING OFFERED
TO THE WOODS.

14:27.605 --> 14:30.130
ALL OF YOU ARE WELCOME.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.305
THANK YOU.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.918
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT ASKING ME

14:35.962 --> 14:37.572
TO GO TO THAT FUNERAL.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.008
SERIOUSLY. TAKE JORDAN.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.924
IT'LL GET HIS MIND OFF
OF BEING DUMPED.

14:41.968 --> 14:45.014
WHERE IS JORDAN
ANYWAY?

14:45.972 --> 14:50.846
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE HE IS. COME ON.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.674
HEY, SUIT YOURSELF.

14:52.717 --> 14:57.635
BUT IF HE GETS US KICKED
OUT, YOU'RE A PIONEER.

15:08.603 --> 15:12.215
MAN: JUST SO SAD, REALLY.

15:27.622 --> 15:31.104
OK, JUST GO INSIDE,
JOSIE.

15:32.018 --> 15:35.151
THAT MURPHY IS
KIND OF CUTE.

15:43.681 --> 15:46.554
BELLAMY:
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.967
MURPHY: GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.099
WHICH PART OF
"I HATE DEAD PEOPLE"

16:10.143 --> 16:12.188
DID YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND?

16:12.232 --> 16:14.190
QUIET, MURPHY.

16:15.452 --> 16:19.195
JORDAN, WE KNOW
YOU'RE IN HERE.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.461
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

16:24.505 --> 16:25.723
WHAT YOU WOULD'VE DONE,

16:25.767 --> 16:28.030
THE YOU BEFORE PRAIMFAYA
ANYWAY.

16:28.074 --> 16:32.426
HEART OVER HEAD. THAT WAS
MY FAVORITE BELLAMY.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
BELLAMY: YOU, TOO?
GAIA: THEY WORSHIP NIGHTBLOODS.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.172
I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND
WHY THAT IS.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.043
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.654
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GETTING
THROWN OUT OF THE ONE
SAFE PLACE ON THIS MOON

16:43.698 --> 16:46.309
BECAUSE YOU GOT DUMPED.

16:47.832 --> 16:50.096
THIS IS SANCTUM'S
HOLIEST PLACE.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.315
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.753
I'M SORRY. I JUST, UH,
I SAW YOU ON THE STEPS.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.234
MURPHY: DOES THAT MEAN YOUR
BODYGUARD COULD, TOO?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.497
JOSEPHINE: GOOD POINT.
LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.325
GAIA: NOT YET.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.330
MARK OF THE FLAME?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.603
THEY'RE ALL COMMANDERS.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.431
BELLAMY: THAT'S WHY
THE SYMBOL WAS ON THE FLAG.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.564
MURPHY: WELL, IT'S ALL
COMING TOGETHER, ISN'T IT?
NOW CAN WE PLEASE GO?

17:23.607 --> 17:26.393
BELLAMY: THE ONES IN
THE FRONT ROW MUST BE
THE ORIGINAL ELIGIUS TEAM.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.439
THERE'S 12 OF THEM.
OH, AND THEY TAKE KIDS.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.051
FAMILIAL LOVE IS
A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.356
PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING
TO ENSURE

17:33.400 --> 17:35.445
THE SURVIVAL OF
THE ONES THEY LOVE.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.665
NOW LET'S ENSURE
OUR SURVIVAL

17:37.708 --> 17:39.536
AND GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.195
OPEN SESAME.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.350
MURPHY: OPERATING ROOM
ATTACHED TO A CRYPT.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.700
REALLY?

18:12.743 --> 18:14.789
SHE WAS HERE.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.139
THIS WAS DELILAH'S.
I'M SURE OF IT.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.445
STILL THINK
I'M OVERREACTING?

18:18.488 --> 18:20.055
OK, LET'S THINK
THIS THROUGH.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.926
BECCA CREATED THE FLAME
AFTER APOCALYPSE ONE.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.626
SHE OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED
THE TECH TO ELIGIUS THREE
BEFORE THAT.

18:25.669 --> 18:26.583
THAT MEANS THAT--

18:26.627 --> 18:28.019
-THEY'RE NOT COMMANDERS.
-RIGHT.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.543
SO WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY?

18:29.586 --> 18:32.111
JORDAN: LET'S FIND OUT.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.682
MONTY TAUGHT HIM
HOW TO HACK, TOO.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.380
THAT'S MY KIND OF
PARENTING.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.772
JORDAN: NO HACKING NEEDED.

18:41.816 --> 18:45.994
THE ELIGIUS SYSTEMS ALL USE
THE SAME ACCESS CODE.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.956
"EUREKA." TRY THAT.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.351
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.747
TODAY'S SUBJECT IS BROOKE,
EARTH EMBRYO 47.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.271
PRESENTS WITH BLACK BLOOD.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.751
21 EARTH YEARS OLD,

19:03.794 --> 19:05.840
22 DOING TIME
IN THE INCUBATOR.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.189
MAN, ON VIDEO:
YOU CAN DO THIS, GABRIEL.

19:07.233 --> 19:11.193
25 YEARS OF WORK, THE
FAILURES. THIS IS THE ONE.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.455
GABRIEL: IF I'M RIGHT,

19:12.499 --> 19:14.414
THE REASON ALL PREVIOUS
METEMPSYCHOSIS TRIALS

19:14.457 --> 19:15.893
HAVE FAILED IS

19:15.937 --> 19:18.200
BECAUSE THE HOST'S NEUROANATOMY
WAS NOT DEVELOPED ENOUGH

19:18.244 --> 19:21.508
TO SUPPORT THE FILE SIZE
OF A MATURE HUMAN MIND.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.379
MAN ON VIDEO:
GABRIEL, LET'S GO.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.598
I'LL HOLD HER DOWN. DO IT.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.382
DO--DO WHAT?
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

19:26.426 --> 19:28.384
MAN ON VIDEO: FOR GOD'S
SAKE, GIVE HER A SEDATIVE!

19:28.428 --> 19:31.257
GABRIEL: WE CAN'T.
FULL CONSCIOUSNESS IS CRUCIAL.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.649
YOU KNOW THAT.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.259
MAN ON VIDEO: IF THIS WORKS,
I'LL FIND A BETTER WAY,

19:33.302 --> 19:34.347
AN EASIER WAY, OK?

19:34.390 --> 19:35.217
I PROMISE.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.711
GABRIEL: ROSTRAL DORSOLATERAL
PONTINE TEGMENTUM'S

19:50.754 --> 19:52.147
NOW FULLY DORMANT.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.846
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR
THE SERUM TO REACH
THE CLAUSTRUM.

19:55.890 --> 20:00.024
AND DORMANT.

20:00.938 --> 20:05.116
DID THEY JUST
KILL THAT GIRL?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.292
DID WE JUST WATCH
SOMEONE DIE?

20:06.335 --> 20:07.728
GABRIEL: HEART RATE
AND BREATHING--NORMAL.

20:07.771 --> 20:10.339
LOWER BRAIN FUNCTION IS
STILL INTACT.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.950
THE BODY'S READY.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.796
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.363
SHE'S WAKING UP.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.365
-JOSEPHINE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
-MOM!

20:36.409 --> 20:37.192
SANCTUM...

20:37.236 --> 20:39.281
IS MINE.

20:42.632 --> 20:43.851
PLEASE STOP!

20:43.894 --> 20:48.290
MAN: JOSEPHINE,
SHH. SHH.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.988
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.431
JOSEPHINE, NO. IT'S OK.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.215
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.477
IT'S ME.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.392
JUST BREATHE.

21:03.436 --> 21:04.785
HEY.

21:04.828 --> 21:07.309
LISTEN TO ME.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.143
GABRIEL?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.759
IS IT REAL THIS TIME?

21:22.803 --> 21:26.459
THIS IS REAL.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.682
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.598
I GOT OLD.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.775
I'VE SPENT
THE LAST 25 YEARS

21:38.819 --> 21:41.300
TRYING TO BRING YOU
BACK.

21:47.741 --> 21:48.916
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.396
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

21:50.439 --> 21:55.139
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.
IT WAS THE RED SUN.

21:55.183 --> 21:58.621
THE ECLIPSE.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.058
I WAS RIGHT.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.538
YEAH. YES, YOU WERE.

22:02.582 --> 22:08.109
IT TURNS OUT IT AFFECTS
MORE THAN JUST INSECTS.

22:08.152 --> 22:08.239
OUR MEMORY DRIVES.

22:09.980 --> 22:15.334
YOU REVERSE-ENGINEERED THEM
TO UPLOAD OUR ENTIRE MINDS.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.469
THAT'S BRILLIANT!

22:27.171 --> 22:29.957
YOU LOOK LIKE GRANDPA.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.629
CONGRATULATIONS,
DR. SANTIAGO.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.545
YOU'VE CONQUERED DEATH.

22:58.638 --> 23:02.468
GABRIEL ON VIDEO: THE KEY
IS A FULLY DEVELOPED BRAIN.

23:02.511 --> 23:06.123
ONCE THE ADULT HOST'S
CONSCIOUSNESS IS GONE,

23:06.167 --> 23:10.301
THE MIND STORED IN THE DRIVE
UPLOADS WITH EASE.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.173
NOW, WE STILL HAVE LOADS OF
TESTS TO RUN,

23:12.216 --> 23:15.916
BUT SO FAR, JOSIE'S
CONSCIOUSNESS, HERSELF,

23:15.959 --> 23:17.918
APPEARS TO BE WHOLE.

23:17.961 --> 23:24.011
IN OTHER WORDS, EUREKA.
MORE SOON.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.667
THEY'RE IMMORTAL.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.409
JORDAN: THEY'RE MURDERERS.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.323
THEY MURDERED DELILAH.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.892
IT'S NOT MURDER IF
THEY GO WILLINGLY.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.635
JORDAN: DID THAT GIRL
LOOK WILLING TO YOU?!

23:39.679 --> 23:40.419
THAT'S HOW THEY MADE
IT BETTER, EASIER,

23:43.509 --> 23:45.336
BY MANIPULATING
PEOPLE INTO
BELIEVING

23:45.380 --> 23:47.513
THEY WERE
SACRIFICING
THEMSELVES

23:47.556 --> 23:49.079
TO SOME
FALSE GODS.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.472
"BECOMING ONE WITH
THE PRIMES,"

23:50.516 --> 23:51.821
LIKE DELILAH'S
MOTHER SAID.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.563
MURPHY: WELL, SO MUCH FOR
RESPECTING THEIR FAITH.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.173
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.654
WE LET A BUNCH OF KIDS
FIGHT TO THE DEATH
TO BECOME YOUR GOD.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.134
BELLAMY:
MURPHY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.049
CLARKE, YOU'RE OK WITH THIS?

24:02.092 --> 24:03.529
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.879
I JUST DON'T THINK
THEY POSE A THREAT
TO US, THAT'S ALL.

24:05.922 --> 24:09.056
THEY POSE A THREAT TO YOU.
YOU'RE A NIGHTBLOOD.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.666
AND BASED ON
WHAT WE JUST SAW,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.494
I'M THINKING THAT'S THE ONLY
REASON THEY LET US STAY.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.715
GAIA: MADI.
I HAVE TO GET HER

24:15.758 --> 24:19.066
BEFORE THEY FIND OUT
WHAT SHE IS.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.373
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.162
BELLAMY: BRING HER BACK
TO THE TAVERN

24:28.205 --> 24:30.686
SO WE CAN DECIDE
WHAT TO DO.

24:34.298 --> 24:37.214
JORDAN: THESE ARE ALL HER.

24:37.258 --> 24:40.740
HEY, JORDAN...

24:41.697 --> 24:44.526
I'M SORRY I DOUBTED YOU.

24:44.961 --> 24:49.139
LOG OUT OF THE SYSTEM.
WE NEED TO COVER OUR TRACKS.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.666
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT I AGREE WITH CLARKE.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.319
THIS ISN'T OUR FIGHT.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.104
YOU STILL WANT TO STAY.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.540
I WANT TO LIVE,

24:58.584 --> 25:01.282
ONLY THESE PEOPLE KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT FOREVER,

25:01.325 --> 25:03.545
AS IT TURNS OUT.

25:04.372 --> 25:06.505
THAT WOULDN'T SUCK EITHER.

25:06.548 --> 25:09.551
REATTACH THE KEYPAD
OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.597
WE'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.036
DIYOZA: WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KNOW WHY

25:16.079 --> 25:18.168
YOUR BROTHER LEFT YOU
OUT HERE TO DIE?

25:19.692 --> 25:23.739
OH, SHUT UP.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.612
YOU'RE A HURRICANE LEAVING
A PATH OF DESTRUCTION

25:26.655 --> 25:28.439
IN YOUR WAKE.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.919
I SAID, SHUT UP.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.660
SO YOU HATE PEOPLE.
WHO CARES?

25:31.704 --> 25:32.966
SUCK UP AND GET OVER IT.

25:33.009 --> 25:36.709
WHATEVER YOU THINK
YOU KNOW ABOUT ME,
YOU DON'T.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.537
YOU'RE WRONG.
I USED TO BE YOU.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.582
YOU KNOW THAT THE MORE
YOU STRUGGLE,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.585
THE DEEPER YOU SINK,
AND YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

25:43.629 --> 25:44.934
AT LEAST I'M TRYING.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.632
YOUR BABY'S TICKET
INTO SANCTUM IS
GETTING AWAY,

25:46.675 --> 25:49.504
AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ABOUT IT?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.593
NOTHING.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.117
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.598
HE'S STUDYING US FROM
THE TREES.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.559
THAT'S WHY HE TOLD US
NOT TO STRUGGLE.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.865
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

26:02.909 --> 26:06.565
YOU WILL AS SOON
AS I GIVE UP THIS GUN.

26:09.785 --> 26:12.571
BEFORE I DO THAT, THOUGH,

26:12.614 --> 26:15.399
I NEED TO KNOW...

26:17.271 --> 26:18.925
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

26:18.968 --> 26:20.230
JUST SAY THE WORD,

26:20.274 --> 26:22.885
AND I CAN PUT YOU
OUT OF OUR MISERY.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.803
YOU THINK YOU CAN
SCARE ME?

26:29.457 --> 26:31.981
DO IT.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.773
I'VE BEEN THERE...

26:41.774 --> 26:43.471
SELF-INFLICTED.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.691
I SEE YOU FAILED
AT THAT, TOO.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.388
YOU'RE TRYING MY PATIENCE,

26:47.431 --> 26:50.173
SO I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY
THIS ONCE.

26:50.217 --> 26:55.875
AS LONG AS YOU DRAW BREATH,
YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.094
EVERYBODY HATES YOU
RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT?

26:58.138 --> 27:00.488
TALK TO ME WHEN YOUR FACE
IS IN THE HISTORY BOOKS

27:00.531 --> 27:04.361
NEXT TO THE WORST PEOPLE
THAT HAVE EVER LIVED.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.113
LIKE THE GRAY.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.116
TOSS US THE ROPE,
AND WE'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.685
TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,
AND I'LL TOSS YOU THE ROPE.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.948
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

27:25.992 --> 27:29.909
SOME OF YOUR PEOPLE HAD
BLOOD ALTERATION.

27:29.952 --> 27:35.044
HOW MANY? DID THEY HAVE
MIND DRIVES AS WELL?

27:35.610 --> 27:37.003
DON'T TELL HIM
ANYTHING.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.962
THE MINUTE YOU DO,
HE'LL LEAVE US
HERE TO DIE.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.706
SUIT YOURSELF.

27:44.750 --> 27:49.363
BUT I CAN GUARANTEE
YOU--AHH--

27:49.406 --> 27:52.671
I CAN WAIT LONGER THAN YOU.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.343
IT'S A RISK MEETING
LIKE THIS.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.041
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:15.084 --> 28:16.869
THEY GOT INTO
THE LAB.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.958
THEY KNOW
EVERYTHING.

28:20.524 --> 28:21.961
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT YOU?

28:22.004 --> 28:24.398
NOT YET, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MATTER NOW,

28:24.441 --> 28:27.749
BECAUSE MY HOST
WASN'T THE ONLY
NIGHTBLOOD.

28:27.793 --> 28:28.750
NIGHTBLOOD?

28:28.794 --> 28:29.795
THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL IT.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.144
IT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH?

28:31.187 --> 28:32.145
ANYWAY, THEY HAVE MORE.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.059
HOW MANY MORE?

28:33.102 --> 28:34.669
I DON'T KNOW.
AT LEAST ONE.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.149
BUT THERE ARE
BOUND TO BE OTHERS.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.629
IF NOT DOWN HERE,
THEN UP ON THEIR SHIP.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.154
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
SKIP THE HAND WRINGING

28:41.197 --> 28:42.938
AND DO WHAT WE ALL KNOW
NEEDS TO BE DONE

28:42.982 --> 28:44.113
BEFORE THEY CAN LEAVE?

28:44.157 --> 28:46.246
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT
THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.726
SO CONVINCE THEM NOT TO.

28:47.769 --> 28:48.857
SIMONE: RUSSELL.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.424
I WILL NOT LOWER MYSELF
TO THEIR LEVEL.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.339
JOSEPHINE: YOU
ALREADY HAVE.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.993
JOSIE.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.691
DAD, I'M TIRED.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.693
I WANT TO SLEEP
IN MY OWN BED,

28:58.737 --> 28:59.999
WEAR MY OWN CLOTHES.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.784
RUSSELL: AND YOU WILL...
RIGHT AFTER YOU FIND OUT

29:02.828 --> 29:05.961
EXACTLY HOW MANY
OF THESE SO-CALLED
NIGHTBLOODS THEY HAVE.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.659
IF YOU'RE RIGHT, THEN WE
CAN RESURRECT THE OTHERS.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.837
AND IT WON'T MATTER THAT WE
JUMPED THE LINE FOR YOU.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.447
OR THAT YOU KILLED KAYLEE.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.797
AFTER SHE KILLED ME.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.016
FINE. FINE.

29:17.059 --> 29:18.887
BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW
THIS DOESN'T
END WELL.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.194
EITHER THEY FIND OUT
WHO I AM AND KILL ME

29:21.237 --> 29:23.109
BEFORE BURNING
SANCTUM TO
THE GROUND,

29:23.152 --> 29:25.285
OR WE BODY-SNATCH
MORE OF THEM

29:25.328 --> 29:26.416
AND KILL THE REST

29:26.460 --> 29:28.418
SO THEY DON'T BURN
SANCTUM TO THE GROUND.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.464
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU TRY MAKING
AN OMELET

29:30.507 --> 29:34.381
WITHOUT
BREAKING ANY EGGS.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.522
MADI: CLARKE, YOU REALIZE
STAYING SAYS

29:45.566 --> 29:46.915
WE'RE OK
WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.657
MURPHY: YEAH, AND WHAT'S
THE ALTERNATIVE?

29:49.700 --> 29:51.224
GO BACK TO SPACE?

29:51.267 --> 29:52.747
SLEEP FOR ANOTHER
HUNDRED YEARS

29:52.791 --> 29:55.924
ON OUR WAY TO A PLANET EVEN
LESS LIKELY TO SUPPORT LIFE?

29:55.968 --> 29:56.969
BUILD OUR OWN COMPOUND.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.492
WE'LL NOT LAST
OUT THERE ON OUR OWN.

29:58.535 --> 29:59.972
EMORI, ECHO, AND RAVEN
WILL BE BACK IN THE MORNING.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.887
THEY'LL KNOW EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO BUILD

30:01.930 --> 30:03.062
A RADIATION SHIELD.

30:03.105 --> 30:06.195
AFTER THAT,
IT'S JUST HARD WORK.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.370
OVER HOW MANY LIFETIMES?

30:07.414 --> 30:09.198
NO, SERIOUSLY,
HOW MANY ECLIPSES?

30:09.242 --> 30:11.200
HOW MANY SWARMS?
HOW MANY TERRORIST ATTACKS?

30:11.244 --> 30:13.159
I AGREE WITH JOHN.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.726
I DON'T LIKE
WHO THEY ARE EITHER,

30:15.770 --> 30:18.077
BUT WE NEED THEM
TO SURVIVE.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.469
THEY'RE MURDERERS,

30:19.513 --> 30:20.906
RAISING PEOPLE TO GIVE UP
THEIR BODIES,

30:20.949 --> 30:23.560
BRAINWASHING THEM INTO
BELIEVING THEY'RE GODS.

30:23.604 --> 30:25.040
GAIA: HE'S RIGHT.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.868
IT'S A PERVERSION
OF EVERYTHING
BEKKA PRAMHEDA BELIEVED.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.565
THE FLAME WAS ABOUT
PASSING WISDOM ON TO
THE NEXT LINE,

30:28.609 --> 30:29.871
NOT KEEPING IT ALL
TO YOURSELF.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.090
MURPHY:
YEAH, WELL, NO OFFENSE,

30:31.133 --> 30:32.831
BUT BECCA WASN'T
A GOD EITHER.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.529
SHE WAS A SCIENTIST
WHO MADE HERSELF
A NIGHTBLOOD IN THE LAB

30:35.572 --> 30:38.314
THE SAME WAY ABBY
DID TO CLARKE.

30:42.101 --> 30:45.060
MADI: SO MUCH
FOR DOING BETTER.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.417
BELLAMY: HEY. HEY, HEY!

30:54.461 --> 30:55.418
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.899
BELLAMY:
HEY. HEY. BAD IDEA.

30:57.943 --> 30:58.639
MURPHY: TAKE IT EASY.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.075
IS EVERYTHING OK
HERE?

31:00.119 --> 31:01.207
HOW CAN YOU BE OK?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.818
SHE WAS YOUR CHILD.

31:03.862 --> 31:07.996
I KNOW. YOU MISS DELILAH.

31:08.954 --> 31:09.824
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.999
FOLLOWERS: HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.828
PRIYA: BUT SHE'S HAPPY, JORDAN.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.918
SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.200
JACKPOT.
FOLLOW ME.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.072
CLARKE.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.684
EVERYTHING OK?

31:51.126 --> 31:53.520
GIVE US A MINUTE.

31:58.003 --> 32:01.354
FINE. WE'LL GO IN HERE.

32:15.194 --> 32:16.978
WHERE WERE YOU GOING?

32:17.022 --> 32:20.851
TO SEE MY MOTHER.
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:20.895 --> 32:23.158
HOW ARE WE ON DIFFERENT
SIDES OF THIS?

32:23.202 --> 32:26.031
I KNOW HOW THEY SURVIVE
SEEMS HARSH.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.336
BUT WHAT FROM
WHAT I'VE SEEN,

32:27.380 --> 32:29.469
THESE PEOPLE ARE HAPPY.

32:29.512 --> 32:32.037
THEIR WORLD WORKS.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.300
WE DESTROYED OURS.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.041
THIS ISN'T ABOUT US.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.826
SO WE CAN JUDGE THEM
BUT NOT OURSELVES?

32:39.653 --> 32:42.134
YOU KNOW I JUDGE MYSELF
EVERY DAY.

32:42.177 --> 32:43.526
I WANT TO KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE

32:43.570 --> 32:45.920
BETWEEN US AND THEM.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.674
I'M SORRY.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.458
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
LAST PHRASE?

33:02.502 --> 33:06.854
IT SOUNDS LIKE "FLASHPA"
MEANS "FLASHBACK."

33:06.897 --> 33:09.900
SO WAS IT "DREAM"?

33:13.034 --> 33:15.689
WHO ARE YOU?

33:31.270 --> 33:33.663
JOSEPHINE LIGHTBOURNE.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.057
NICE TO MEET YOU.

33:41.367 --> 33:44.152
OK, FUN'S OVER. LET'S TALK.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.545
DON'T YOU DARE SAY A WORD.

33:45.588 --> 33:46.589
XAVIER: IT'S FINE. WE CAN
WAIT TILL SHE GOES UNDER.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.200
I ONLY NEED ONE OF YOU.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.418
OK, HERE'S THE DEAL.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.246
I'M GONNA TALK AFTER
YOU DIE TO SAVE MYSELF.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.248
SO WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
ACCOMPLISHING?

33:53.292 --> 33:54.554
XAVIER: SHE GETS
A HERO'S DEATH.

33:54.597 --> 33:57.035
BUT IF YOUR SILENCE HELPS
THE WRONG SIDE,

33:57.078 --> 33:58.427
ARE YOU STILL A HERO?

33:58.471 --> 34:03.258
YOU SEE, BY MY COUNT, YOU'VE
KILLED 12 OF MY PEOPLE,

34:03.302 --> 34:05.130
AND WE'VE KILLED
NONE OF YOURS.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.479
SO WHO'S THE VILLAIN?

34:06.522 --> 34:07.915
I'M GONNA SAY YOU

34:07.958 --> 34:09.656
SINCE YOU KIDNAP
LITTLE KIDS.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.223
BUT FEEL FREE TO
PROVE ME WRONG

34:11.266 --> 34:12.485
AND TOSS ME
THAT ROPE.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.748
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
BLOOD ALTERATION?

34:14.791 --> 34:16.184
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES!
TELL HIM.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.365
DIYOZA:
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!

34:23.409 --> 34:25.585
A TEMPORAL FLARE.

34:31.678 --> 34:34.637
GET OUT AND RUN!

34:36.335 --> 34:39.903
I CAN'T MOVE.
SAVE YOUR BABY!

34:47.172 --> 34:49.696
I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU.

35:22.946 --> 35:25.340
OCTAVIA.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.128
HOLD ON!

35:31.259 --> 35:32.913
HOLD ON!

35:48.320 --> 35:53.586
UH!

35:53.629 --> 35:54.630
OCTAVIA?

35:55.414 --> 35:57.677
OCTAVIA!

36:05.250 --> 36:07.687
YOU WENT UNDER.

36:07.730 --> 36:11.169
I GUESS YOU WANT TO LIVE
AFTER ALL.

36:13.693 --> 36:16.217
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.453
ABBY...

36:34.496 --> 36:35.671
YOU NEED TO EAT
SOMETHING.

36:35.715 --> 36:38.283
ABBY: CLARKE SOLVED
THE KIDNEY PROBLEM.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.849
LET'S SAY YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.547
WE USE THE SHIP'S HEMOSEP.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.202
KANE'S BLOOD PRESSURE
GOES DOWN.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.855
RISK OF EMBOLI.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.249
ONCE HE NORMALIZES,
WE OPEN HIM UP AGAIN,

36:48.293 --> 36:50.120
AND WE USE THESE LEAVES

36:50.164 --> 36:52.210
AGAINST THE NEW
HEMORRHAGING WE FIND.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.994
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA WORK.

36:54.037 --> 36:57.389
EVEN IF THE O.R.
WAS FULLY STOCKED,

36:57.432 --> 37:02.350
ABBY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A 15-HOUR PROCEDURE.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.830
ONCE A POD IS OPEN,

37:03.873 --> 37:06.789
MARCUS HAS 10 MINUTES, TOPS.

37:06.833 --> 37:10.097
ABBY: NO, YOU'RE WRONG.
JACKSON: NO, I'M RIGHT.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.273
I'M RIGHT, AND YOU DON'T
WANT TO FACE THIS

37:12.317 --> 37:15.711
BECAUSE YOU'VE REPLACED
PILLS WITH THIS.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.235
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

37:18.497 --> 37:21.326
I AM TRYING TO
GET YOU TO SEE
THE TRUTH.

37:21.369 --> 37:25.155
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT I KNOW THE TRUTH?

37:25.199 --> 37:29.159
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
I WANT TO SAVE MARCUS?

37:30.378 --> 37:32.293
IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF PILLS.

37:32.337 --> 37:36.645
IT'S BECAUSE
HE'S GOOD...

37:36.689 --> 37:37.167
AND TRUE,

37:38.212 --> 37:42.042
AND HE DESERVES
TO LIVE,

37:42.085 --> 37:45.219
AND WE DON'T.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.311
YOU AND ME--WE STOOD
BY BLOODREINA

37:50.355 --> 37:52.226
DURING
THE DARK YEARS,

37:52.270 --> 37:54.359
AND MARCUS WAS
THE ONLY ONE

37:54.402 --> 37:57.666
WHO TRIED TO
STOP IT.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.020
DID YOU?

38:05.239 --> 38:09.417
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

38:09.983 --> 38:14.944
SAID BY EVERY
WAR CRIMINAL EVER.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.444
W--WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

38:36.488 --> 38:38.577
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE MOTHER IS THE KEY.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.796
OH, SHE'S
THE WHOLE BALL GAME,

38:40.840 --> 38:42.363
THE SUPER BOWL,
IF YOU WILL.

38:42.407 --> 38:47.237
AND IF WE'RE GONNA WIN,
I NEED A BETTER COACH.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.988
WOMAN: WOULD YOU LIKE
ANOTHER DRINK?

38:59.032 --> 39:02.818
AH, WHY NOT? THANKS.

39:10.739 --> 39:13.351
PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.788
WHAT'S A PENNY?

39:15.831 --> 39:19.052
SOMETHING FROM MY TIME.

39:20.270 --> 39:21.576
LET ME GUESS.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.623
BELLAMY CONVINCED YOU THAT
WE SHOULD LEAVE PARADISE

39:24.666 --> 39:26.973
AND TAKE OUR CHANCES
IN HELL?

39:27.016 --> 39:28.888
WHY I WOULD LEAVE
MY HOME?

39:28.931 --> 39:33.283
THAT'S IT. FILL
IN THE BLANKS, JOHN.

39:33.327 --> 39:38.376
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE CALLED ME...

39:46.384 --> 39:47.907
OK, BEFORE YOU
FREAK OUT

39:47.950 --> 39:49.430
AND RAISE
YOUR VOICE,

39:49.474 --> 39:51.650
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU.

39:51.693 --> 39:54.435
YOU'RE NOT CLARKE.

39:55.218 --> 39:57.351
I'M GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.526
CLARKE'S DEAD.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.877
MY PARENTS KILLED HER
AND BROUGHT ME BACK.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.270
MY QUESTION IS,

40:03.313 --> 40:07.796
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE IMMORTAL, TOO?

40:13.541 --> 40:14.673
I'M LISTENING.
