WEBVTT

00:02.860 --> 00:05.113
Well...
See you after the break.

00:05.114 --> 00:06.702
What are you all doing
for Thanksgiving?

00:06.703 --> 00:08.137
I'm having
Andre's whole family over,

00:08.138 --> 00:09.572
though he'll be stuck
working at the stereo store

00:09.573 --> 00:10.640
for Black Friday.

00:10.641 --> 00:12.391
Oh, sure, you get to say that,

00:12.392 --> 00:14.927
but we're stuck
calling it "Jew Friday."

00:14.928 --> 00:18.430
Ugh, I'll be with my family,
fielding the same old questions.

00:18.431 --> 00:19.615
"How's community college?"

00:19.616 --> 00:20.600
"What's your major?"

00:20.601 --> 00:21.584
"Are those real?"

00:21.585 --> 00:22.718
My aunt's boyfriend.

00:22.719 --> 00:24.804
"Oh, my family's
a normal religion,

00:24.805 --> 00:26.372
"so I have to talk to them
for five minutes

00:26.373 --> 00:29.191
before I get a casserole
that's all marshmallow."

00:29.192 --> 00:30.176
That's you.

00:30.177 --> 00:31.377
Brainstorm.

00:31.378 --> 00:32.995
Why don't you all
come over to my house?

00:32.996 --> 00:34.130
I'll have plenty of food.

00:34.131 --> 00:35.097
- That would be great.
- Marshmallows.

00:35.098 --> 00:36.365
Sounds good to me.

00:36.366 --> 00:37.400
I was going to microwave
buttered noodles,

00:37.401 --> 00:38.634
but this sounds
equally promising.

00:38.635 --> 00:39.952
I'm in.
Oh, goody.

00:39.953 --> 00:41.537
Well, you know,
you're all welcome, of course.

00:41.538 --> 00:43.339
- I'm in.
- Or, you know, Jeff or whoever.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.440
Can't. Plans.

00:44.441 --> 00:45.775
Well, if you change your mind,

00:45.776 --> 00:47.526
I can't think of anyone
who would enjoy having you more.

00:47.527 --> 00:49.996
How-Dean, pilgrims.

00:49.997 --> 00:51.564
- Is that...
- John Wayne, yes.

00:51.565 --> 00:52.798
Oh, good, you got it.

00:52.799 --> 00:56.586
Anyhoo, I just thought
I'd mosey on over here,

00:56.587 --> 00:59.171
invite you all
to Greendale's annual

00:59.172 --> 01:01.824
Thanks-living
potluck dinner,

01:01.825 --> 01:04.860
where we remember all we have
to be thankful for.

01:04.861 --> 01:06.195
There may be a statistical link

01:06.196 --> 01:08.514
to enrollment at Greendale
and holiday suicide.

01:08.515 --> 01:10.132
- Oh.
- Just a shoelace...

01:10.133 --> 01:12.551
and belt-free night
full of fun.

01:12.552 --> 01:14.453
You should all drop by.

01:14.454 --> 01:15.588
Or Jeff.
Or whoever.

01:15.589 --> 01:16.672
Oh, he can't.
He has plans.

01:16.673 --> 01:18.024
Oh, right,

01:18.025 --> 01:19.191
you are spending Thanksgiving
with your father.

01:20.510 --> 01:23.012
I thought I told you
to stop reading my email.

01:23.013 --> 01:25.765
Yeah, well, I thought I told
you to stop keeping secrets.

01:25.766 --> 01:26.932
How am I supposed to keep track

01:26.933 --> 01:28.434
of what you tell me
in confidence

01:28.435 --> 01:29.719
and what I hear
through your walls

01:29.720 --> 01:30.819
with a glass to my ear?

01:34.023 --> 01:36.058
Fine.
Close your mouths.

01:36.059 --> 01:38.227
I'm having Thanksgiving
with my estranged father.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.195
Can we move on now?

01:39.196 --> 01:40.379
Makes sense.

01:40.380 --> 01:41.731
Jeff's at a point in his life

01:41.732 --> 01:43.633
where he needs a strong
father figure to come out to.

01:43.634 --> 01:45.868
Jeff, this is huge news.

01:45.869 --> 01:47.353
Huger news.

01:47.354 --> 01:50.022
Was this decision made after
our Halloween conversation?

01:50.023 --> 01:52.858
Yes, after.
Not because of.

01:52.859 --> 01:55.027
I'll take it.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.731
You had that teed up?

01:58.732 --> 02:00.616
When I say "thera,"
you say "pist."

02:00.617 --> 02:01.617
Thera...

02:01.618 --> 02:02.585
- pist.
- Thera...

02:03.587 --> 02:04.637
Thanks for the support, guys.

02:04.638 --> 02:07.523
Oh, the support has just begun.

02:07.524 --> 02:09.258
What do you want me to bring
to papa Winger's house,

02:09.258 --> 02:11.410
some vegan pumpkin pie?

02:11.411 --> 02:12.778
Britta, you're not coming.

02:12.779 --> 02:15.014
Fine, regular pumpkin pie.

02:15.015 --> 02:16.215
Jeff, you're going to need me

02:16.216 --> 02:17.950
when things get messy
and emotional.

02:17.951 --> 02:19.318
The only thing that's going
to get messy and emotional

02:19.319 --> 02:21.203
is Troy, when he realizes
there are yams

02:21.204 --> 02:22.388
underneath those marshmallows.

02:22.389 --> 02:24.390
I knew it was too good
to be true.

02:24.391 --> 02:26.976
Jeff, speaking not just
as your friend

02:26.977 --> 02:29.512
but as an avid
daytime TV watcher,

02:29.513 --> 02:33.616
these parent-child reunions
can get intense.

02:33.617 --> 02:35.234
Chairs might be thrown.

02:35.235 --> 02:36.652
Weaves might be pulled.

02:36.653 --> 02:37.937
Or I could just go in there,

02:37.938 --> 02:40.106
show him how awesome I am,
no thanks to him,

02:40.107 --> 02:41.057
meet my half-brother...

02:42.025 --> 02:43.909
And then, boom.
Closure.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.628
Your dad has another son?

02:45.629 --> 02:47.063
Yeah.
So, clearly, he's moved on.

02:47.064 --> 02:48.964
Why can't I?
Close your mouths.

02:48.965 --> 02:50.566
Look, I appreciate
your concern,

02:50.567 --> 02:52.918
but really, the most helpful
thing you can do

02:52.919 --> 02:54.286
is stay out of my business.

02:54.287 --> 02:56.205
Oh, can you
say that last part again?

02:56.206 --> 02:58.257
These walls
are entirely too thick.

02:58.258 --> 03:00.459
♪ Give me some rope

03:00.460 --> 03:02.178
♪ tie me to dream

03:02.179 --> 03:03.495
♪ give me the hope

03:03.496 --> 03:05.331

03:48.375 --> 03:50.126
Oh!
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

03:50.127 --> 03:51.210
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:51.211 --> 03:53.279
Let's carve that jive turkey!

03:53.280 --> 03:55.915
- Got that out of your system?
- Yeah.

03:55.916 --> 03:57.333
Then I'm so happy
to welcome you all to my home.

03:57.334 --> 04:00.553
- Oh, thank you.
- Hello, come in.

04:00.554 --> 04:02.754
Take your coats off.
Make yourself comfortable.

04:02.755 --> 04:04.306
Browse the available literature

04:04.307 --> 04:05.775
about Jesus Christ
as your personal savior.

04:05.776 --> 04:07.960
Or not.
No agenda.

04:07.961 --> 04:09.929
Are you going
to pass some apps soon,

04:09.930 --> 04:12.164
or do I have to die
of starvation to prove a point?

04:12.165 --> 04:13.315
Oh, everybody,

04:13.316 --> 04:14.617
this is Mr. Bennett,
my father-in-law.

04:14.618 --> 04:16.267
Dad, these are my friends
from college.

04:17.487 --> 04:19.704
Oh, yeah.
That's Andre's people.

04:19.706 --> 04:20.805
They're a bunch of characters.

04:20.807 --> 04:22.341
That's a good one, dad.

04:22.342 --> 04:24.760
- Oh, I brought something.
- Oh.

04:24.761 --> 04:26.078
Dip.

04:26.079 --> 04:29.331
Oh, Abed, why is this
seven layer dip so puffy?

04:29.332 --> 04:30.866
Oh, it's been in the fridge
for two years.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.768
I was saving it
for a special occasion.

04:32.769 --> 04:34.186
Oh, that's so thoughtful.

04:34.187 --> 04:35.554
I'm going to put this
on a nice platter

04:35.555 --> 04:36.872
with some crackers
in the trash.

04:36.873 --> 04:37.840
Where's Britta?

04:37.841 --> 04:40.009
Hey, Jeff.
What's up?

04:40.010 --> 04:41.927
What's up is closure.

04:41.928 --> 04:44.513
I met my dad,
we talked things out as men.

04:44.514 --> 04:45.748
I think I'm ready to move on.

04:45.749 --> 04:47.032
Really, in 20 minutes?

04:47.033 --> 04:51.787
Fine.
Look, I couldn't do it.

04:51.788 --> 04:53.889
I was at the front door,
totally in control,

04:53.890 --> 04:55.774
and then I started thinking
about all that stuff you said

04:55.775 --> 04:59.595
about messiness,
and it threw me off my game.

04:59.596 --> 05:01.096
You know, the irony is,

05:01.097 --> 05:03.566
after all your pestering that
I deal with my daddy issues,

05:03.567 --> 05:06.018
you're the reason
I'm not meeting my father.

05:06.019 --> 05:08.921
Or maybe I'm the reason
you'll come here after all.

05:08.922 --> 05:10.039
Britta, I...

05:10.040 --> 05:12.892
Wait.
What do you mean by "here"?

05:12.893 --> 05:14.493
Your dad's house,

05:14.494 --> 05:19.131
where I kind of, sort of, am.

05:19.132 --> 05:20.249
Yeah, thanks, Sharon.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.800
I never thought
about it that way.

05:21.801 --> 05:23.419
Batman is sort of gay.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.854
Be right back.

05:24.855 --> 05:27.356
What is going on?

05:27.357 --> 05:29.024
Why is Thanksgiving
so terrible?

05:29.025 --> 05:30.442
I know.

05:30.443 --> 05:33.629
The tension, the backbiting,
the judgmental comments.

05:33.630 --> 05:36.248
This makes Thanksgiving
with my family look...

05:36.249 --> 05:37.616
eh, still pretty bad.

05:37.617 --> 05:39.635
I said Batman was gay.

05:39.636 --> 05:41.770
Ugh.
Sheesh.

05:41.771 --> 05:44.406
You ask one lady
if she's Tyler Perry in drag,

05:44.407 --> 05:45.841
and suddenly,
you're the bad guy.

05:45.842 --> 05:48.177
It's a reference.
That's my humor.

05:48.178 --> 05:49.778
Abed gets it.

05:49.779 --> 05:51.447
Oh, you're all hiding out
in here.

05:51.448 --> 05:54.366
- We're not hiding.
- You know us, hide away.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.651
Well, be careful.

05:55.652 --> 05:56.952
You might be
giving the impression

05:56.953 --> 05:58.671
that you prefer the cold garage

05:58.672 --> 06:01.023
to the warm heart
of my hospitality.

06:01.024 --> 06:03.175
What? As if.

06:03.176 --> 06:04.142
Yay.

06:04.143 --> 06:05.327
Uh-huh.
Okay.

06:05.328 --> 06:08.347
Well, hurry back soon.

06:08.348 --> 06:09.899
This is the Jonestown
of dinners.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.216
I feel like I'm in jail.

06:11.217 --> 06:13.469
And you know what happens
to guys like me in jail.

06:13.470 --> 06:14.703
They get really
into push-ups,

06:14.704 --> 06:19.541
and I am fine with my upper body
the way it is!

06:19.542 --> 06:21.010
It did feel like a prison,

06:21.011 --> 06:23.929
and that meant only one thing
made sense, conceptually.

06:23.930 --> 06:25.247
We had to break out.

06:25.248 --> 06:26.949
And someone with the gravitas
of Morgan Freeman

06:26.950 --> 06:28.900
had to narrate it.

06:28.901 --> 06:30.168
We need to do a prison break.

06:35.674 --> 06:37.109
Happy Thanksgiving?

06:37.110 --> 06:38.811
You really "you'd"
this one, huh?

06:38.812 --> 06:41.179
Okay, yes, I meddled
against your wishes,

06:41.180 --> 06:43.181
and yes, I got this address
from the Dean,

06:43.182 --> 06:44.182
but hey.

06:44.183 --> 06:45.284
You had a moment of doubt,

06:45.285 --> 06:46.852
and here I am
to help you through it.

06:46.853 --> 06:49.187
Psychology tells us
there are no accidents.

06:49.188 --> 06:50.322
Oh, really?

06:50.323 --> 06:51.407
What about car accidents,
Tara Reid,

06:51.408 --> 06:53.025
or the Hindenburg?

06:53.026 --> 06:54.575
Here goes nothing.

06:59.131 --> 07:00.081
Hello, William.

07:05.048 --> 07:08.769
So, uh... how about we make
a couple of ground rules?

07:08.770 --> 07:11.227
Actually, that sounds good.
Okay. No hugs.

07:11.228 --> 07:12.695
Wouldn't want one.
No apologies.

07:12.696 --> 07:14.947
Wouldn't accept one.
No calling you "dad."

07:14.948 --> 07:16.849
- No expectations.
- No B.S.

07:16.850 --> 07:17.850
- Drink?
- Scotch.

07:17.851 --> 07:19.202
- 18?
- Neat.

07:19.203 --> 07:20.570
I just want to acknowledge

07:20.571 --> 07:22.705
that there are a lot
of emotions flowing right now,

07:22.706 --> 07:25.658
and you two are probably
feeling a strong impulse

07:25.659 --> 07:26.993
to sleep with each other,

07:26.994 --> 07:29.712
and hey, that's normal.

07:29.713 --> 07:33.783
Wow.
I'll get the drinks.

07:33.784 --> 07:36.452
So, how about that?
No muss, no fuss.

07:36.453 --> 07:39.489
Jeff, I urge you not to run
from the muss and fuss.

07:39.490 --> 07:41.109
Hi.

07:42.643 --> 07:43.676
Hi.

07:43.677 --> 07:45.161
You must be
my half-brother.

07:45.162 --> 07:48.581
Oh, your hands are so much
bigger than mine.

07:48.582 --> 07:50.416
Your nail beds are perfect.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.834
I can't do it.
I can't.

07:51.835 --> 07:53.152
Oh, God.

07:53.153 --> 07:54.120
Oh, it's coming up.

07:54.121 --> 07:55.655
When I get upset, I vomit.

07:55.656 --> 07:58.107
Oh, I see you've
met Willy Junior.

07:58.108 --> 08:01.127
You said he wasn't going
to replace me.

08:01.128 --> 08:03.679
He's the Schwarzenegger.
I'm the DeVito.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.864
I get it.

08:06.116 --> 08:08.484
Okay, fellas,
let's get right into it.

08:08.485 --> 08:12.472
I think the big question
on everyone's mind is

08:12.473 --> 08:14.657
why don't I go
help Willy Junior?

08:14.658 --> 08:15.991
Hmm?

08:18.377 --> 08:20.580
One thing was clear to me
and the rest of the crew.

08:20.581 --> 08:23.149
Bennett lockup was not
where we belonged.

08:23.150 --> 08:25.368
We belonged in the sun,
with the wind in our hair,

08:25.369 --> 08:27.570
or maybe at a Bennigan's,
enjoying a Turkey O'Toole.

08:27.571 --> 08:29.238
We should tunnel out.

08:29.239 --> 08:30.973
Abed, Shirley is our friend,

08:30.974 --> 08:32.225
and we're guests in her home.

08:32.226 --> 08:33.759
We need a plan
that won't hurt her feelings,

08:33.760 --> 08:35.328
or damage her property.

08:35.328 --> 08:37.797
Definitely don't look
behind that poster, then.

08:37.798 --> 08:39.499
I could pretend
to have a stroke.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.317
Do a gibberish
foreign language.

08:41.318 --> 08:44.837
<i>What if I did a gibberish
foreign language like Star Wars?</i>

08:44.838 --> 08:46.656
You'd like that, I bet.
Dick.

08:46.657 --> 08:49.425
Look, I'm sure we'll
figure out a way out of here.

08:49.426 --> 08:52.695
What's important right now
is that we stick together.

08:52.696 --> 08:54.830
- Yeah.
- Oh, there you are.

08:54.831 --> 08:56.249
Who wants
a pre-dinner snack?

08:56.250 --> 08:57.800
Oh!

08:57.801 --> 08:59.252
Oh, pumpkin, what's wrong?

08:59.253 --> 09:02.205
Oh, it's too embarrassing

09:02.206 --> 09:03.756
to talk about
in front of the guys,

09:03.757 --> 09:04.974
know what I mean, girlfriend?

09:04.975 --> 09:06.108
Oh, sweetie.

09:06.109 --> 09:07.777
Do you have your monthly shame?

09:07.778 --> 09:10.062
Do you want to lie down
in Elijah's room?

09:10.063 --> 09:12.064
Oh, I don't think
that's going to cut it.

09:12.065 --> 09:13.933
I probably need to go home
and call Dr. Collins.

09:13.934 --> 09:14.984
It's that bad.

09:14.985 --> 09:16.035
Oh, well, you know,

09:16.036 --> 09:17.820
my sister-in-law's
a gynecologist,

09:17.821 --> 09:19.205
and she's right
in the other room.

09:19.206 --> 09:21.574
There's no need to bother
your doctor on a holiday.

09:21.575 --> 09:22.959
Go ahead.
Mm-hmm.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.627
I'd like to tell you
Annie avoided.

09:24.628 --> 09:26.529
Shirley's doctor
sister-in-law,

09:26.530 --> 09:27.880
but this ain't no fairy tale.

09:27.881 --> 09:29.782
This is Thanksgiving.

09:29.783 --> 09:32.752
Let's see, what else?

09:32.753 --> 09:35.671
You've got some diabetes,
on my mother's side.

09:35.672 --> 09:36.622
Good to know.

09:36.623 --> 09:37.823
I like your hair.

09:37.824 --> 09:40.142
The presence of it, I mean.

09:40.143 --> 09:43.045
So I have a question,

09:43.046 --> 09:44.997
and it's been weighing
on me pretty heavily.

09:44.998 --> 09:48.284
At your age, in the bedroom...

09:48.285 --> 09:50.970
Oh, yeah.
It's all good.

09:50.971 --> 09:53.105
- Yeah?
- Real good.

09:53.106 --> 09:55.808
Look at them.
Bonding.

09:55.809 --> 09:58.394
Probably laughing
'cause I can't grow a beard.

09:58.395 --> 09:59.679
I have an idea.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.597
Why don't we
use these dinner rolls

10:01.598 --> 10:03.583
to do some "roll" play?

10:03.584 --> 10:05.718
I see what I did there.

10:05.719 --> 10:07.219
Okay.

10:07.220 --> 10:11.090
This roll, this is me.

10:11.091 --> 10:12.575
He's crying.

10:12.576 --> 10:14.944
Good.
That's really good.

10:14.945 --> 10:17.413
So, uh, what do you do?

10:17.414 --> 10:20.066
I'm a lawyer
who faked a bachelor's degree

10:20.067 --> 10:21.567
and practiced law
for seven years

10:21.568 --> 10:22.568
before I got caught.

10:24.087 --> 10:25.421
I like your hustle.

10:25.422 --> 10:28.190
Reminds me of the summer
I was Ralph Lauren

10:28.191 --> 10:29.225
out in St. tropez.

10:29.226 --> 10:32.127
'83, I'm on a boat with, uh...

10:32.128 --> 10:33.762
Damn it, Willy!

10:33.763 --> 10:35.665
- I'm expressing.
- Knock it off.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.701
Why can't you just swallow it,
like any normal person?

10:38.702 --> 10:41.687
Oh! Oh, right.
Like your new son.

10:41.688 --> 10:44.140
Like mister...
mister I've got my shirt...

10:44.141 --> 10:47.076
I don't know a lot of
personal details about you yet.

10:47.077 --> 10:48.210
Well, my name's Jeff.

10:48.211 --> 10:51.113
Don't help me,
mister helper guy.

10:51.114 --> 10:52.748
First mom dies, now this?

10:52.749 --> 10:54.583
Hey, she died
20 years ago, Willy.

10:54.584 --> 10:56.352
He keeps singing
the same old song.

10:56.353 --> 10:58.688
Wow.
She died on you.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.723
Here I thought you'd
become father of the year,

11:00.724 --> 11:02.141
but you just got stuck.

11:02.142 --> 11:03.592
Yeah, well, look,
I don't have to tell you

11:03.593 --> 11:05.678
I'm not a natural caretaker,

11:05.679 --> 11:08.581
but with Willy, you know,
I-I checked all the boxes,

11:08.582 --> 11:11.450
and he still turned out
softer than wet cheese.

11:11.451 --> 11:13.285
I don't get it.

11:13.286 --> 11:15.304
He keeps saying he's going
to move out next week,

11:15.305 --> 11:16.422
since '03.

11:16.423 --> 11:18.691
Oh, man, I couldn't
wait to get out.

11:18.692 --> 11:20.126
I got my own place
when I was 18.

11:20.127 --> 11:23.312
I was the same way.

11:23.313 --> 11:26.349
So who's ready to eat?

11:26.350 --> 11:28.817
Jeff, you care
to carve the turkey?

11:28.818 --> 11:30.336
I knew it!

11:30.337 --> 11:32.071
You love him more than me.

11:32.072 --> 11:34.290
I'll show you.
I'll run away.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.276
Oh, please.
Hey, be my guest.

11:37.277 --> 11:40.512
You run away, and I'm going
to sleep like a baby tonight.

11:42.798 --> 11:45.234
Oh, now, I'm sorry
you guys had to see that,

11:45.235 --> 11:46.986
but maybe you could
shrink his head,

11:46.987 --> 11:49.004
since you're here
for some reason.

11:49.005 --> 11:52.608
Yes.
I can do this.

11:52.609 --> 11:54.827
Show me on the dinner roll
where you're hurt!

11:54.828 --> 11:57.496
And that's how it went
for the afternoon.

11:57.497 --> 12:00.449
This tag team turkey day
became our routine.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.985
We endured the indignities
as best we could.

12:02.986 --> 12:05.221
Cousins fighting,
complaints about the food,

12:05.222 --> 12:07.490
listening to a nephew
do Borat for a full hour.

12:07.491 --> 12:10.142
We figured out ways
to steal away from time to time,

12:10.143 --> 12:13.095
saying we had to pee,
had to get ice,

12:13.096 --> 12:14.797
had to do a jewish thing
in the other room.

12:16.883 --> 12:20.603
I became known as the guy
who could get you things

12:20.604 --> 12:24.340
piece of gum, playing cards,

12:24.341 --> 12:27.243
some novelty glasses I found
in a box marked "crap."

12:27.244 --> 12:30.446
In those brief,
tranquil moments, we felt human.

12:30.447 --> 12:31.914
We felt free.

12:31.915 --> 12:35.751
But sooner or later,
our warden would come knocking.

12:35.752 --> 12:38.254
Mostly, we just waited
for our time to be served,

12:38.255 --> 12:40.906
but some didn't
take kindly to waiting.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.391
Some didn't
have much time left.

12:42.392 --> 12:44.693
Enough.
Amateur hour is over.

12:44.694 --> 12:47.296
I'm going in there,
pretend to break a hip,

12:47.297 --> 12:51.716
and we'll be sipping Sambuca
at skeepers in no time.

12:56.206 --> 12:57.907
Whoa.
He tripped on the rug.

12:57.908 --> 12:59.592
Wait, now he's getting up.

12:59.593 --> 13:02.077
He's walking around dazed
like he's got a head injury.

13:02.078 --> 13:03.813
Oh, groin into the corner
of the table.

13:03.814 --> 13:05.147
This might actually work.

13:05.148 --> 13:06.115
Ow.

13:07.217 --> 13:09.401
Wait, wait,
why are people laughing?

13:11.138 --> 13:14.240
Let's see, I need a broom,
a rake, or two rakes...

13:14.241 --> 13:16.325
Pierce, you were supposed
to pretend to injure yourself

13:16.326 --> 13:17.710
so we could leave.

13:17.711 --> 13:19.261
Leave?

13:19.262 --> 13:21.831
<i>This is my
showtime at the Apollo.</i>

13:21.832 --> 13:23.365
I'm killing out there.

13:24.734 --> 13:28.003
Pierce was our last hope,
or so we thought.

13:28.004 --> 13:31.941
It seemed Troy Barnes
had a plan.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.108
What if we got sick?

13:33.109 --> 13:35.611
No.
No more faking illnesses.

13:35.612 --> 13:40.081
Not fake sick.
Real sick.

13:46.422 --> 13:50.376
And that's when I told
my old firm to shove it.

13:50.377 --> 13:53.312
I've always been more
of a free agent, anyway.

13:53.313 --> 13:55.614
Yeah, I can see that about you.

13:55.615 --> 13:58.000
You seem
like a self-made man.

13:58.001 --> 14:00.436
Well, I kind of had to be.

14:00.437 --> 14:03.689
Look, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to break a rule.

14:03.690 --> 14:05.140
I know we said
"no mushy stuff,"

14:05.141 --> 14:08.627
but for what it's worth,
I'm proud of you.

14:08.628 --> 14:11.280
Wow.
Thanks.

14:11.281 --> 14:13.632
Makes you think.

14:13.633 --> 14:15.084
Wait, what do you mean?

14:15.085 --> 14:18.070
Well, look, I mean, you've
seen how Willy turned out.

14:18.071 --> 14:20.306
I mean, I haven't
done that kid any favors.

14:20.307 --> 14:22.191
And so I look at you,

14:22.192 --> 14:25.427
so self-reliant
and well-adjusted,

14:25.428 --> 14:27.813
and I think
maybe I did something right.

14:27.814 --> 14:29.498
You did something right?

14:29.499 --> 14:33.285
Well, let me
say that different.

14:33.286 --> 14:35.070
Uh, the universe
is a constantly expanding...

14:35.071 --> 14:36.488
stop.

14:36.489 --> 14:38.057
I get the impulse, but
that's not going to work here.

14:38.058 --> 14:39.542
No, I just mean that, uh,

14:39.543 --> 14:42.027
we are defined
by what happens to us,

14:42.028 --> 14:46.282
and me leaving seems
to have made you independent,

14:46.283 --> 14:47.516
made you strong.

14:47.517 --> 14:51.386
With all due respect,
which is none,

14:51.387 --> 14:53.221
go to hell.

14:53.222 --> 14:55.324
So tunneling out
is off the table?

14:55.325 --> 14:58.327
Who's hungry for turkey?

14:58.328 --> 14:59.828
Shirley, we were just...

14:59.829 --> 15:00.829
About to...

15:00.830 --> 15:02.248
Eat garbage dip.

15:02.249 --> 15:05.701
Why did I have to go third?

15:05.702 --> 15:07.469
Look, I get it.
You want to leave.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.805
Shirley, we're sorry.

15:09.806 --> 15:11.941
No, I'm sorry.

15:11.942 --> 15:14.643
To be honest, I invited you
as a bit of a buffer.

15:14.644 --> 15:17.096
With Andre's family,
I'm always the butt of the joke,

15:17.097 --> 15:18.480
and with Andre gone this year,

15:18.481 --> 15:20.933
I thought I could tip the scales
in my favor

15:20.934 --> 15:23.269
by having a few friends around.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.721
That was wrong of me.

15:25.722 --> 15:28.023
See you Monday.

15:29.359 --> 15:30.559
I can't believe
none of us noticed

15:30.560 --> 15:32.444
she was having
such a hard time.

15:32.445 --> 15:34.630
We can't leave.

15:34.631 --> 15:35.948
Funny thing about prison.

15:35.949 --> 15:38.066
Sometimes the person
you thought was your warden

15:38.067 --> 15:39.835
turns out
to be a fellow prisoner,

15:39.836 --> 15:42.104
<i>which doesn't really line up
with the whole Shawshank thing,</i>

15:42.105 --> 15:44.356
<i>but maybe we've always been doing
more of a Prison Break.</i>

15:44.357 --> 15:45.323
The show.

15:52.958 --> 15:56.722
- Whoa, what are you doing in my car?
- Take me with you.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.907
Teach me what you know.

15:57.908 --> 15:59.842
What in the cat's cradle
is happening?

15:59.843 --> 16:01.043
Dad hates me.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.178
What do you care
what that guy thinks?

16:02.179 --> 16:03.312
He's a dick.

16:03.313 --> 16:05.598
See, that's
what I need to learn!

16:05.599 --> 16:08.417
How to be all dead inside
with muscles on top,

16:08.418 --> 16:10.402
not all emotional and flabby.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.354
Yeah, but you are emotional,

16:12.355 --> 16:13.422
and if you pretend you're not,

16:13.423 --> 16:14.440
you're only letting him
off the hook

16:14.441 --> 16:15.875
for being a terrible father,

16:15.876 --> 16:17.576
which he is
and always has been.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.929
I mean,
he meant the world to you,

16:19.930 --> 16:22.047
and you meant nothing to him,

16:22.048 --> 16:26.485
and if you run away now,
he'll never know.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.688
He should know.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.191
Britta's the worst.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.292
Ow!
Jeez.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.479
Oh.
I thought you guys left.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.881
We started as your buffer,

16:38.882 --> 16:40.099
but we're busting you
out of here now.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.333
Mm-hmm.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.619
I drew a map of your house
on my stomach.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.271
Uh, I know what my house
looks like.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.705
That's what I said.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.740
Look, if we act fast,
we can get through this plan,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.609
which is to put you
in the trash can,

16:50.610 --> 16:51.677
take you out like trash,

16:51.678 --> 16:52.578
but we got to dress you
like a baby.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.747
Thank you so much
for doing this,

16:54.748 --> 16:56.015
but I'm not going anywhere.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.650
Those people up there,
they may be rude,

16:57.651 --> 16:58.934
they may be pushy,

16:58.935 --> 17:00.436
they may have come
to some wrongheaded conclusions

17:00.437 --> 17:01.820
about Batman and Robin...

17:01.821 --> 17:03.222
Oh, thank you.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.390
But they're my family,

17:04.391 --> 17:05.858
and family means
putting up with each other

17:05.858 --> 17:07.108
even when it's hard.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.962
You guys can go.
I'll be fine.

17:09.963 --> 17:13.232
Actually, we're going to stay.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.617
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.901
Family sticks it out.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.801
That's ni...

17:19.972 --> 17:22.458
Okay, full disclosure.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.410
We're hiding out
from that crazy white guy.

17:26.945 --> 17:27.913
You came back!

17:27.914 --> 17:29.248
I'm sorry.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.250
You should take some credit
for who I've become.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.434
Okay.

17:32.435 --> 17:35.387
So, let me tell you
how I turned out,

17:35.388 --> 17:39.675
just so you're crystal clear
on your impact.

17:39.676 --> 17:42.711
I am not well-adjusted.

17:42.712 --> 17:45.698
More often than not,
I am barely keeping it together.

17:45.699 --> 17:48.033
I'm constantly texting,

17:48.034 --> 17:49.685
and there's no one
at the other end.

17:49.686 --> 17:51.420
I'm just a grown man

17:51.421 --> 17:53.071
who can't even
look his own friends

17:53.072 --> 17:54.123
in the eye for too long

17:54.124 --> 17:56.174
because I'm afraid
that they'll see

17:56.175 --> 17:57.443
that I am broken.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.495
So you get credit for that.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.696
Oh, come on, now...

18:00.697 --> 18:02.765
One time,
when I was in seventh grade,

18:02.766 --> 18:06.135
I told everybody at school
that I had appendicitis.

18:06.136 --> 18:07.670
I wanted someone
to worry about me.

18:07.671 --> 18:11.090
But when Beth Brannon asked
to see the scar,

18:11.091 --> 18:12.257
I didn't want to get found out,

18:12.258 --> 18:16.495
so I took mom's scissors,
and I made one.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.581
It hurt like hell,
but it was worth it.

18:19.582 --> 18:23.035
Because I got 17 cards,

18:23.036 --> 18:25.521
and I still keep them in a box
underneath my bed

18:25.522 --> 18:26.989
22 years later

18:26.990 --> 18:29.525
because it proves that someone,

18:29.526 --> 18:31.710
at some point, cared about me.

18:31.711 --> 18:35.347
You want to see the scar?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.133
So you get credit
for that, too.

18:38.134 --> 18:39.785
This is me.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.722
Look, Jeff, I, uh...

18:44.690 --> 18:45.758
Daddy!

18:45.759 --> 18:48.894
Are you faking a heart attack?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.947
Kind of a Hail Mary.

18:51.948 --> 18:54.082
Happy Thanksgiving, dad.

19:00.689 --> 19:03.859
Look, you're probably
feeling a very strong urge

19:03.860 --> 19:05.077
to sleep with me right now,

19:05.078 --> 19:06.611
and that is normal.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.864
Sha.

19:08.865 --> 19:12.251
Britta, thank you.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.853
You were right.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.122
You're not going to get all
"jock jams" on me, are you?

19:17.123 --> 19:19.191
No, of course not.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.676
I left my boom box at school.

19:21.678 --> 19:24.079
Oh. Jeez.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.364
You got to stop doing that.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.750
Thank you.
Come here, brother.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.733
- Oh.
- Come here, brother.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.052
Wow.

19:30.053 --> 19:31.804
Why don't you save some
for Christmas, buddy, okay?

19:31.805 --> 19:34.590
And then Pierce did whiteface
over blackface.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.758
No one was amused.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.693
It's meta.
Abed gets it.

19:37.694 --> 19:40.446
So, Troy, how was
your first real Thanksgiving?

19:40.447 --> 19:41.497
No offense to Shirley,

19:41.498 --> 19:42.765
but I don't see
what the fuss is about.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.900
Thanksgiving's the wors...

19:44.901 --> 19:47.419
Oh!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.171
I heard your Thanksgiving
wasn't much better than mine,

19:49.172 --> 19:50.889
so I thought
we could take some time

19:50.890 --> 19:53.208
and be grateful
for our real family.

19:53.209 --> 19:54.993
The one we chose.

19:54.994 --> 19:58.163
- So pretty.
- Sit, sit, sit.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.416
<i>We never got
to do a Shawshank homage,</i>

20:00.417 --> 20:02.501
not the way I wanted to.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.586
Maybe the hardest prisons
to break out of

20:04.587 --> 20:07.239
are the ones without locks.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.091
Wait, that doesn't
make any sense.

20:09.092 --> 20:11.743
After that day, Jeff seemed
like a man unburdened.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.179
He told me
about seeing his father again,

20:14.180 --> 20:15.514
about how leaving there
felt like breaking free

20:15.515 --> 20:17.683
of an emotional prison
he'd been in for years.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.968
Something about shackles
on his heart?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.687
To be honest,
I stopped listening.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.088
I was thinking about Christmas.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.389
<i>I hope we do Die Hard.</i>

20:24.390 --> 20:25.757
I hope it's in a restaurant.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.260
I hope it lays out as cleanly
as it does in my dreams.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.745
I hope it's cool.

20:29.746 --> 20:30.762
Cool, cool, cool.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.197
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.598
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone,
including you, Dean.

20:58.681 --> 21:00.211
Oh, my.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.820
I'll have to remember this
for next year.
