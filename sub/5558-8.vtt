-Why?

you’d be in charge

04:19.125 --> 04:20.083

modeling.

That’s great. That’s awesome.
That’s good.

17:41.458 --> 17:44.750
I’m gonna just
go have some...

17:44.750 --> 17:45.917
What was that all about?

17:45.917 --> 17:48.542
-Gross, Tyler!
-That wasn’t me.

17:48.542 --> 17:49.667
TIM: Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.709
How’s it going over here?

17:50.709 --> 17:52.917
-Oh, boy.
-How’s your dinner? Just...

17:52.917 --> 17:54.333
...checking in on you.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.917
All right, good.

17:56.917 --> 17:58.792
(coughs) Aw.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.041
I better not get pinkeye.

18:07.041 --> 18:10.291
to go around the table
and for each person to say

18:10.291 --> 18:12.583
what they’re thankful for
for this year.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.667
Honey, do you want to stand?

18:14.667 --> 18:16.583
Oh, I’m, um...

18:16.583 --> 18:18.375
I got a really good seal
going here.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.750
Oh, sit. Oh, absolutely sit.

18:20.750 --> 18:24.542
JOHN: Yeah. Anyway,
great life, great family.

18:24.542 --> 18:28.625
Got some new boat shoes
I’m really excited about.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.458
Amen. Tim?

18:30.458 --> 18:33.000
Uh, family, new friends,
and a nice walk home

18:33.000 --> 18:34.500
in the fresh air. Greg?

18:34.500 --> 18:35.792
-Come back to me.
COLLEEN: Oh, I’ll go.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.250
Oh, no, no. No, baby.
No, no, no.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.166
No, no, time is pain.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.875
JOHN: Yeah, that about
covers everybody.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.375
Great meal, guys.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.709
See you again next year, huh?

18:42.709 --> 18:44.917
(loud, overlapping chatter)

18:44.917 --> 18:47.333
GARY: Excuse me.
I would, I--I...

18:47.333 --> 18:49.709
I would like to say
a few words if you don’t mind.

18:49.709 --> 18:53.542
-Oh.
GARY: You know, this is my...

18:53.542 --> 18:55.375
This is my first Thanksgiving
without Helen.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.291
She was my--my one and only.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.709
I re--I really miss her.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.667
I miss her, too.
I miss her so much!

19:02.667 --> 19:04.375
JEN: Wish she were back!
COLLEEN: To Helen.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.542
GREG: Gone too soon.
Gone too soon.

19:06.542 --> 19:08.166
-Way too soon.
GARY: Yes, thank you.

19:08.166 --> 19:11.250
But, you know, perhaps
the best way to...

19:11.250 --> 19:15.000
...to honor her memory would be
a moment of silence.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.291
She loved silence.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.208
(groans)

19:19.208 --> 19:21.667
JEN: Uh, okay.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.208
(panting)

19:23.208 --> 19:25.542
Greg, be careful.

19:25.542 --> 19:26.750
That’s what makes
the baby come out.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.166
(muffled laughter)

19:30.750 --> 19:32.458
GREG: Stop.
-I think I’m crowning.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.291

19:41.208 --> 19:43.458
GARY: You are the most
insensitive family

19:43.458 --> 19:45.000
I have ever met.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.166
No, no. You are laughing
at a grieving man.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.375
GREG: I’m not, I’m not,
I’m really trying...

19:48.375 --> 19:49.542
GARY: Oh, come on.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.500
I mean, you’re mocking my loss.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.917
JOAN: No. No, no, no,
it’s not that.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.375
-That’s it.
JOAN: It’s not that at all.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.041
Your son needs to be
out of that garage

19:59.041 --> 20:00.667
by the end of the week,
or you’ll be fined.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.041
JOAN: Don’t--don’t do that.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.625
GARY: And I want to thank you
for one very...

20:04.625 --> 20:07.375
...uncomfortable evening.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.583
(flatulence rippling)

20:11.625 --> 20:13.125
Well, I bet
he’s more comfortable now.

20:13.125 --> 20:16.041
(laughter)

20:22.750 --> 20:24.208
All right,
Matt can stay in the garage.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.917
JOAN: Thank you.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.041
But if there are
any more infractions,
