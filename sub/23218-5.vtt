00:25.025 --> 00:26.494
WOMAN:
Do you love him?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.029
Ananya.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.598
Is he nice?

00:30.631 --> 00:33.334
Uh, I mean, you met him.
You didn't think he was nice?

00:33.367 --> 00:36.504
I mean to you.
Is he nice to you?

00:36.537 --> 00:37.738
Yeah, he's a good man.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.006
How do you know?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.508
PREM:
You can't know.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.709
Not everything, anyway.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.511
I'll learn about her as we go.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.613
But what if you don't like
what you learn?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.014
Well, then I'll pray.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.582
For what?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.851
The strength to understand him.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.853
I'd pray for
a good divorce lawyer.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.988
Stop.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.192
MAN:
She's gonna change you.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.028
Marriage is supposed
to change you.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.864
It's a good match.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.480
We all should bless
the newly-married couple now.

("Bhootni Ke"

01:53.714 --> 01:55.649
BUCK:
16 DOA so far.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.117
Mostly blunt trauma to the head

01:57.151 --> 01:59.587
or crushed by falling debris
or other bodies.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.922
One victim impaled.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.591
They fell through two stories.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.759
I won't be surprised
if that number goes higher.

HEN:
Captain, the groom

02:07.495 --> 02:09.797
is devastated-- his bride
hasn't been accounted for yet.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.000
We'll find her. Buck,
I'm gonna need you to go up top.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.169
Access to the second floor
is blocked.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.438
We're gonna have to tackle
this thing from both ends.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.106
Okay, Captain.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.543
Savita! Savita!

02:22.576 --> 02:24.512
-Savita! -Step back.
Step back, it's okay.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.614
If she's in there,
we will find her.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.617
-Sir, stay back. Sir, let us
do our job. -Savita!

02:29.650 --> 02:31.985
Just have a seat,
let us do our job.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.316
-Ah. Here we go.
-My leg...

03:02.350 --> 03:03.817
I think it's broken.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.819
Okay, you hang tight.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.495
BUCK:
I got you.

03:14.528 --> 03:18.131
Here we go. We're good,
we're good. All right.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.670
Buck. Buck, get over here

All right, is she breathing?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.387
BUCK:
I think so.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.088
Hey, she's coming to.
You got it?

03:41.121 --> 03:43.524
BOBBY:
Yeah.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.395
Hold on, stay still.
Stay still in there.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.797
Here. Here. We got you.
Give me your hand.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.699
Okay. Can you move?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.066
All right.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.968
Come on.
Slowly, all right?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.137
We got you.
We got you.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.541
We got you. Okay, got her.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.077
Easy. Easy.
Watch your head.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.246
PREM:
Savita.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.118
-All right.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.832
Is the owner here?

04:24.865 --> 04:27.000
-Uh, that's him right there.
Why? -Hey.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.437
When'd you put on
the third floor?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.004
When did you put on
the third floor?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.240
-You think I don't know
what that is

04:33.273 --> 04:36.109
What... -That's Kal-Pal!

04:36.143 --> 04:37.578
That stuff's been banned.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.913
You didn't reinforce
the concrete with steel.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.248
Instead you used that crap.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.950
This used to be
a two-story building.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.018
That floor that collapsed--
that was the roof, wasn't it?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.487
Wasn't it?!

04:46.520 --> 04:48.522
-HEN: Bobby! -You know what
you did, you son of a bitch!

04:48.556 --> 04:50.458
You're going to jail.
That's manslaughter!

04:50.491 --> 04:51.959
-HEN: Captain, Captain, Captain.
!

04:51.992 --> 04:54.962
Captain, Captain, come away.
What is wrong with you?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.864
-Back off, Hen.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.433
Not 24 hours ago,
you were saying, "Help."

04:59.467 --> 05:00.868
What happened to that?

05:03.871 --> 05:07.007
So, this wedding--
it's an arranged marriage.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.642
That's a trip, right?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.512
Can you imagine committing
to someone you don't even know?

05:12.413 --> 05:15.883
Does anyone really know anybody?

05:20.988 --> 05:24.692
HEN: So how long they gonna have
you chained to that desk?

05:24.725 --> 05:28.128
ATHENA: Well, the Creedys are
ready to drop their complaint--

05:28.161 --> 05:29.630
you know, so long
as the department

05:29.663 --> 05:31.331
drops the charges
on their daughter.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.034
-Not even a little bit.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.970
That girl is wicked.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.338
How's May doing?

05:38.372 --> 05:40.541
She's at home.
I mean, it feels like

05:40.574 --> 05:43.176
we're back on solid ground.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.713
If we ever were.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.181
I swear, it's like I don't even
know these people

05:48.215 --> 05:49.883
I'm supposed
to be the closest to.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.152
There's a lot of that
going around.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.587
Trouble at home?

05:53.621 --> 05:55.055
Mm.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.057
No, no, no. Not at home.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.059
At least, not yet, no.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.728
It's Bobby.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.195
Clark Kent?

06:02.229 --> 06:04.765
After the plane crash...

06:04.798 --> 06:06.266
he went on a bender.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.001
Didn't answer his phone
for, like, two days.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.838
Buck and I went over there
to make sure he was still alive.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.508
And can I tell you,
there was not one single picture

06:14.542 --> 06:16.444
on the wall.
Nothing, no sign of a family.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.046
Nothing. It was just,
it was weird.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.381
This guy's been our captain
for, like, over a year,

06:21.415 --> 06:23.250
and in all that time,
he's never really

06:23.283 --> 06:25.252
talked about his personal life.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.388
It's like he's got
this invisible wall up.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.525
What, you think his wife
left him, took everything?

06:31.559 --> 06:33.527
See, it didn't look like
somebody had come

06:33.561 --> 06:35.095
and cleared out.
It was more like...

06:35.128 --> 06:37.030
nobody ever moved in.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.699
Like he's not even really there.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.868
Well, if you want,
I'll do a background check.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.770
I got nothing else to do
all day anyway.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.772
Nah. Bobby already
got trust issues.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.541
I don't want those problems.
Nah.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.810
And it's, you know...
It's not like I'm saying

06:49.843 --> 06:51.812
that he's a bad captain.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.481
Hell...

06:53.514 --> 06:56.884
I think he's the best captain
I've ever worked under.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.952
But I'm starting to worry
about him.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.927
So... what'd you mean
by "not yet"?

07:06.960 --> 07:10.798
Before, when I asked
if there was trouble at home,

07:10.831 --> 07:12.466
you said "not yet."

07:12.500 --> 07:14.568
I got a call this morning

07:14.602 --> 07:17.805
from Palmar Women's
Correctional Facility.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.240
What does she want?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.842
To see me.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.978
She said it's urgent.
I feel like I owe it to her.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.680
You don't owe her anything.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.749
In fact, you got credit
in that account.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.284
You're right.
But she didn't fight us

07:31.318 --> 07:32.620
when we wanted to adopt Denny.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.321
I just don't want her
making waves.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.289
And what does your wife
have to say about that--

07:36.323 --> 07:38.592
you going to visit your ex
at the pokey?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.460
I haven't told her yet.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.967
Look like Bruce Wayne isn't
the only one with a few secrets.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.007
-MAN: Go, Pack, go! -JOE BUCK
: A lot of big plays,

07:54.041 --> 07:57.444
-week one... -Jamie,
this is our roommate, Buck.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.179
He's a fireman.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.781
-Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yeah!

08:00.814 --> 08:02.616
-Give me some! -Boom!

08:02.650 --> 08:04.518
-That's what I'm talking about!

08:04.552 --> 08:06.186
:
Contact down the field.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.455
-Out of time outs! -They're
trying to give Laquon Treadwell

08:08.488 --> 08:10.123
an opportunity.
A lot of contact--

08:10.157 --> 08:13.661
-Treadwell's got his hands
on him as well.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.995
-I got more flyers.
-Oh, thanks.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.364
-Can you just
stick them in here, please?

08:17.397 --> 08:18.632
Hello?

08:18.666 --> 08:21.301
Hey, it's Buck.
I got your text.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.470
Oh, hey. Um, yeah,
I know, I just...

08:23.503 --> 08:25.405
I sent a blast out
to all my contacts.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.240
Are you, are you okay?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.142
:
Um, no.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.979
I'm not. I'm kind of having
a nervous breakdown.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.883
Um... h-how long's
she been gone?

08:35.916 --> 08:36.884
I don't know.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.720
Maybe, like,
nine hours or something.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.489
She was gone when I woke up.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.658
So I called, you know,
I've called the police,

08:44.692 --> 08:46.660
I've called the hospitals,
the shelters...

08:46.694 --> 08:49.563
My brother's in Vegas. He's
gonna try to get a flight back.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.599
Look, I'm-I'm gonna come over.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.670
We'll, uh, we'll find your mom
and then we can go back

08:56.704 --> 08:59.106
to never seeing each other
again, okay?

08:59.139 --> 09:02.542
Thanks.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.764
-Hey, baby.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.468
Uh...

09:28.501 --> 09:29.937
Thanks for coming by.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.739
:
How long has it been, a year?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.573
Sorry, I've--
I just, you know,

09:33.607 --> 09:36.209
I haven't been able to get back
to see you. I'm sorry.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.477
No, it's cool.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.413
I mean, you got a life
and a wife.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.382
How's Diesel?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.152
We, uh, we call him Denny.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.921
None of my business, right?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.791
You, uh, you said something
about an emergency?

09:50.824 --> 09:53.126
You don't want to take a minute,
check in with your girl?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.494
You're not my girl.

09:54.527 --> 09:58.265
Yeah. Okay.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.235
My parole hearing.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.905
It's coming up soon and my
lawyer says I've got a shot.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.407
'Cause I haven't got in a fight
in, like, two years,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.643
and I've been taking a bunch
of accounting courses so...

10:09.677 --> 10:13.180
What do you need from me?

10:15.182 --> 10:18.151
I need someone to vouch for me
at my hearing.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.691
You are a respected member
of the community,

10:23.724 --> 10:26.694
and maybe you could, uh...

10:26.727 --> 10:29.730
maybe you could
wear your uniform.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.033
I mean, my lawyer
says that I'm close,

10:33.066 --> 10:35.035
but someone like you
would put me over the top.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.205
I haven't seen you
in over a year, Eva.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.143
What would I even say?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.845
You know me.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.682
I mean, you know me better
than anyone has ever known me.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.151
And you loved me.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.620
I mean, that time
we shared together

10:53.653 --> 10:56.456
was the best part of my life.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.492
And I've changed.

10:59.526 --> 11:03.530
I'm... I'm not
that troublemaker anymore.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.834
You can see that, can't you?

11:10.070 --> 11:10.871
Oh.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.875
-Um...

11:16.243 --> 11:17.911
Abby.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.246
Hi, Buck.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.815
So what do we know so far?

11:21.849 --> 11:25.152
Come in. Come--
yeah, come in. Thanks.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.254
I'm Carla, by the way.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.660
So we're here.
I made assumptions based on

11:33.693 --> 11:35.863
her being on foot,
because if she's on a bus,

11:35.896 --> 11:39.666
or in a taxi, then... she could
have gotten much further.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.034
No, this is good.
This is really impressive.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.569
What do you figure,
like, two miles an hour

11:42.602 --> 11:44.071
-Three.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.073
-Patricia's an annoyingly
fast walker. -Yeah.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.741
Even if she's been gone
for nine hours,

11:47.775 --> 11:49.709
she couldn't have been walking
the entire time.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.278
I know. That's what
I was thinking, so I figure,

11:51.311 --> 11:54.247
maybe 15 to 20 mile range,
but then that seems too far,

11:54.281 --> 11:56.049
so I brought it down to 12.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.951
But in any direction,
so we would have

11:57.985 --> 12:01.855
just under 527 square miles
to check.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.058
But, I mean, literally,
she could be anywhere.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.527
I...

12:07.560 --> 12:09.362
I don't know what to do.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.731
I'm so much better when it's
somebody else's emergency.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.134
No one is good
when it's personal.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.903
But we got this, okay.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.705
We're gonna find your mom.
Promise.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.608
Okay. How are we gonna do it?

12:22.609 --> 12:24.878
One mile at a time.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.446
Let's go find her.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.881
Okay.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.549
-Come on.
-All right.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.684
CARLA:
Thanks.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.892
BOBBY:
I'm lost.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.994
Figured the only way
for a guy like me

12:41.028 --> 12:43.263
to pull off leading a crew...

12:43.296 --> 12:47.134
was by shielding them
from my own personal damage.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.237
How'd that work out?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.005
It was fine for a while.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.308
Left my baggage at home, made
work about getting the job done.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.743
It kept things focused.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.147
But after you log in enough
48-hour shifts,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.182
actually living
with your coworkers...

13:02.215 --> 13:05.085
Withholding can become
a challenge.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.921
They've given me
their absolute trust,

13:07.955 --> 13:12.425
and I've given them nothing
in return.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.660
That can always change, Bobby.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.428
All it takes is a conversation,

13:15.462 --> 13:17.197
kind of like this one.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.335
It's not that simple.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.844
There are things about me
they just can't know.

13:30.878 --> 13:34.681
Things I can't risk following us
out into the field.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.886
You mean that you
fell off the wagon?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.322
No.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.161
That I murdered my own family.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.005
*

14:03.010 --> 14:05.812
* Fire till he is done in

14:05.845 --> 14:10.483
* But they catch you
at the border *

14:10.517 --> 14:13.520
* And the mourners
are all singin' *

14:13.553 --> 14:16.189
* As they drag you by your...

14:16.223 --> 14:18.491
WEATHERMAN :
Forecast, cloudy and windy

14:18.525 --> 14:21.494
and cold this morning,
warming up a bit this afternoon,

14:21.528 --> 14:23.263
with a few sun sprays...

14:23.296 --> 14:24.898
-Daddy.
-Brookie.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.767
You smell minty.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.069
Did I miss dinner?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.603
Oh, and bath time and homework,

14:30.637 --> 14:33.206
but you're just in time for
teeth-brushing and bed.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.607
WEATHERMAN:
The wind's out of the northwest

14:34.641 --> 14:35.775
at 14 miles per hour.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.244
It's currently...

14:39.712 --> 14:41.881
Dad. Dad.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.685
You were falling asleep
on the potty.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.254
Oh, I'm just wiped out
from work.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.223
We had two fires, brought
an old lady to the hospital,

14:50.257 --> 14:52.960
a false alarm and I had
to wash the truck. Come on.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.295
Do you want to hear what
I told Mom in the car today?

14:55.328 --> 14:56.429
BOBBY:
What?

14:56.463 --> 14:59.466
-The best place to catch on fire
is a firehouse. -Uh-huh.

14:59.499 --> 15:03.570
And the best car to get hit by
is an ambulance,

15:03.603 --> 15:06.940
and the best place to get robbed
in is inside a police station.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.209
Where'd you get
such a beautiful brain?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.543
Probably Target.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.548
How was your day, bud?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.649
Are you okay?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.218
Has your back been hurting?

15:18.251 --> 15:21.854
I can just always tell
when your back is hurting you.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.327
Listen.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.098
Everything is gonna be
all right.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.969
I love you.
You have sweet dreams.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.470
I love you, too, Dad.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.739
Good night.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.474
Good night, Dad. Love you.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.476
Good night. I love you, too.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.018
BROOK:
Sweet dreams.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.487
I'm going for my walk.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.989
Oh, it's-it's freezing out.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.658
Yeah, just, if I don't go
for my walk before bed,

15:58.691 --> 16:00.127
my back tightens up.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.429
Eh, you know, maybe we should
see another doctor.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.764
I mean, why should you
still hurt

16:04.797 --> 16:06.266
five years after you injured it?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.800
All the doctors say
the same thing,

16:07.834 --> 16:09.269
that I'm lucky to be walking.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.438
A broken back never really
fully heals, so...

16:11.471 --> 16:13.040
All right. I'll...

16:13.073 --> 16:15.308
Wait. Don't-don't go.

16:15.342 --> 16:19.146
Babe, I'm-I'm gonna be
right back, all right?

17:51.971 --> 17:55.142
Ah, damn it.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.386
Hey.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.497
When we got married,
I accepted the idea

18:50.530 --> 18:53.700
that when you went to work,
you might not come home.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.668
Baby, I just forgot my phone
and then I lost track of time.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.437
-I was just walking.
-I-I never really thought

18:57.470 --> 18:59.105
about what it was
I was so scared of losing.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.941
I mean, no woman
wants to lose her husband.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.943
You know, the-the love
of her life,

19:03.976 --> 19:06.213
the father of her children.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.649
:
You're my rock, Bobby.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.118
-Sweetheart, I love you so...
-No, no, don't touch me.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.520
-Okay, okay.
-Don't.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.323
You've been lying to me
for months.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.059
But it's so obvious.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.128
Sneaking out
and you're losing weight

19:22.161 --> 19:23.563
and falling asleep.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.798
You know, but I didn't want
to believe it

19:25.832 --> 19:27.166
because you were so adamant

19:27.200 --> 19:28.401
when you got out of rehab
last year

19:28.435 --> 19:29.802
that that was,
that was the last time.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.372
There would be no relapses.
And I thought

19:32.405 --> 19:34.574
you would never risk
getting caught

19:34.607 --> 19:36.676
at work again
and losing your job.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.013
So what is it? I mean, I know
about the booze, right?

19:41.047 --> 19:44.183
But Is it pills?
Is it heroin?

19:44.217 --> 19:47.320
Just everything.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.323
It's anything to make
the pain go away.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.191
Look, I took a fall
about ten months ago.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.593
I didn't want to tell you
about it.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.595
Because you knew I was gonna
make you quit.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.096
No. I-I was handling it.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.565
I thought I was.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.100
I had a-- look,
I got a prescription.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.669
Look, I thought I was
handling it.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.404
I just-- like you said,
I'm your rock.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.172
No. No, no, no.
Don't you put this on me.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.507
That's not what I mean.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.175
I just, I'm not weak.
I can beat this.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.344
This is not who I am.
This is not me.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.546
All right? I'm strong.
I am unbreakable.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.415
I-I'm Superman.
I go into burning buildings

20:15.448 --> 20:17.284
and I come out
without a scratch.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.185
That's me, not this.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.288
And I don't know when it
flipped over into addiction,

20:21.321 --> 20:23.189
but I... I got
that prescription.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.724
I didn't tell you about it.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.759
And I just needed the OxyContin,
and I started to need it more--

20:26.793 --> 20:28.528
24 hours a day--
and then if I couldn't get it,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.062
I went to get something else.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.131
So what? So you would
go to work high?

20:32.164 --> 20:35.535
You would-- you'd drive our kids
to school high?

20:35.568 --> 20:36.769
I'm sorry.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.272
-I will get help.
I will go back to rehab.

20:39.306 --> 20:43.476
-I'll do anything.
-I don't want you here tonight.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.378
You spend the night
in your drug den

20:45.412 --> 20:47.614
-or wherever.
Then what?

20:47.647 --> 20:52.218
I love you, Bobby.
I don't-- I love you.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.756
I'll forgive you for this,
just... not tonight.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.710
Oh.

22:58.445 --> 23:01.414
(sirens wailing,
fire truck horn honking)

23:43.590 --> 23:45.725
I'm right here. I'm right here.
Do you think you can walk?

23:45.758 --> 23:46.793
The alarms didn't go off.
The sprinkler!

23:46.826 --> 23:48.795
Try to stay calm.
Can you walk?

23:48.828 --> 23:50.663
-All right,
you stay here. I will come back

23:50.697 --> 23:52.965
-before the smoke gets too
thick. -No, wait, wait, wait.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.267
-Just stay right here. I will
be back. Stay down. -Please!

24:00.139 --> 24:02.008
Marcy?!

24:02.041 --> 24:04.410
Bobby! Brook!

24:19.025 --> 24:21.427
Marcy! Brook!

24:21.460 --> 24:23.262
-We have to evacuate. Come on!
-Brook! Bobby!

24:23.295 --> 24:25.665
-Now!
-Brook! We have to get up there!

24:25.698 --> 24:27.199
-My kids are up there! -We'll do
what we can, okay? You need

24:27.233 --> 24:29.468
-to get out of here! -Give me
your gear. Give me your...

24:29.502 --> 24:30.703
Get out of here!
Let us do what we have to do!

24:30.737 --> 24:31.871
-Come on! -Give me your gear!
Give me your gear!

24:31.904 --> 24:33.606
-Get this guy out of here!
-Give me your gear!

24:33.640 --> 24:35.341
-Come on!
-Give me your gear!

24:35.374 --> 24:36.909
:
Marcy?!

24:39.912 --> 24:42.481
BOBBY: The super never mentioned
who was using the apartment.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.050
Guess he didn't want
any trouble.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.053
I don't understand.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.021
How does a...

24:49.055 --> 24:51.457
a space heater cause a fire
like that?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.960
The building was a death trap.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.795
Nothing to code.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.364
Cheap, flammable
facade materials

24:58.397 --> 25:01.333
acted as an accelerant.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.637
The sprinklers weren't
hooked up.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.338
You never noticed?

25:06.372 --> 25:08.374
No.

25:08.407 --> 25:11.310
Maybe now, sober,
I would, but...

25:13.345 --> 25:15.882
I chose to disappear.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.685
Lived on pills and vodka
for two years.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.592
148 people died in that fire,
including...

25:31.063 --> 25:33.532
I killed them.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.937
My own kids, my own family.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.008
I murdered them in their sleep.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.077
Choked 'em on smoke and
I burned their little bodies.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.852
Such a burden.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.387
Such a burden,
and you've been carrying this

25:55.421 --> 25:58.090
all by yourself all this time.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.963
It's not the kind of story
I want to share.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.598
With your friends?

26:05.632 --> 26:07.133
And your coworkers?

26:07.166 --> 26:08.735
I'm their leader.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.103
They have to trust me enough
to follow me

26:11.137 --> 26:13.205
into situations
where their lives are at risk.

26:13.239 --> 26:17.209
There is no room...
for them to doubt me.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.712
You made a mistake, Bobby.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.816
Every church is built on the
possibility of human redemption.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.886
God forgives more easily
than people do.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.556
You know, if you don't
trust your friends

26:30.589 --> 26:33.125
to see and know you
for who you are--

26:33.159 --> 26:35.895
honestly, completely--

26:35.928 --> 26:38.831
then you don't really have
any friends.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.669
Give them a chance.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.603
You're allowed to be human.

26:44.637 --> 26:47.139
:
I just miss 'em so much.

27:01.220 --> 27:04.123
So you about ready
to tell me what's bugging you?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.992
You're not gonna like it.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.195
Something's bothering you.
I don't expect to like it.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.030
What is it?

27:11.063 --> 27:13.800
Eva called.
She's up for parole.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.338
Great.

27:19.371 --> 27:24.777
She asked me to speak
on her behalf at the hearing.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.212
Good.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.781
You can tell the parole board
that she's nothing but trouble,

27:28.815 --> 27:31.350
and needs to stay locked up
and out of our lives.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.685
Out of Denny's life.

27:32.719 --> 27:35.054
HEN:
Baby, I hear you, I do,

27:35.087 --> 27:37.656
but I really think
she's made an effort this time.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.559
She's done a lot
of career education.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.361
She's taken
some accounting courses.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.330
She's trying.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.833
Have you been to see her?

27:53.272 --> 27:55.241
Can't believe this.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.542
She's not even out yet,

27:56.575 --> 27:58.144
and she's already
got you sneaking around.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.478
Karen, that's not fair.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.881
Did she even ask about Denny?

28:01.914 --> 28:03.816
Hmm?

28:03.850 --> 28:05.885
Sort of, in passing.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.254
She doesn't give a crap
about him.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.655
Good, good.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.257
That's a good thing.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.691
Because if she gets out,

28:12.725 --> 28:16.062
we don't want her involved
in Denny's life.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.064
That's why I went
to go see her.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.066
I don't want her--
we, we don't want to

28:20.099 --> 28:23.235
give her a reason
to be vindictive.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.672
She's really...
she's not as bad as you think.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.878
Baby... she's worse.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.283
'Cause she will always be
your first great love.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.951
Oh, come on.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.521
ATHENA:
Yeah, I see your BOLO

28:42.554 --> 28:45.024
right here-- Patricia Clark,
75-year-old white female.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.795
They got me riding a desk right
now, but I'll keep my ears open.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.563
Thank you, Sergeant.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.532
She won't let us down.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.267
And we have this.

28:55.301 --> 28:58.037
-So if a call
comes in about your mom,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.972
we can be first on the scene.

29:00.006 --> 29:04.276
Kind of a bummer we had to meet
under these circumstances.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.546
I mean, especially with
our "only on the phone" plan.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.782
Worst first date ever, right?

29:11.483 --> 29:13.752
I've probably had worse.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.924
Well, I mean, to be honest,
it's a little fuzzy.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.626
It's been a while
since I've been out on a date.

29:20.659 --> 29:21.961
How long

29:21.994 --> 29:24.730
Try more like almost a year.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.766
What? I mean,
that's not possible.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.736
Who do you have sex with?

29:30.769 --> 29:34.006
You've not had sex
in almost a year?

29:34.040 --> 29:37.143
No, I haven't had sex
in-in-in a year...

29:37.176 --> 29:38.677
-...probably.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.246
:
Oh, my God.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.680
I didn't say that.

29:41.713 --> 29:45.617
Although, I am more a,
you know, human contact,

29:45.651 --> 29:47.987
you know, touch of skin
kind of person.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.956
It's just really hard
to feel sexy

29:49.989 --> 29:52.624
with your mom dying
in the dining room.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.928
MALE DISPATCHER:
Respond to 800 Comstock Ave.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.663
TA into power pole.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.665
High-voltage wires down
in swimming pool.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.633
Three-year-old child trapped.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.837
That's, like, two blocks
from here.

30:04.871 --> 30:07.006
Truck's been dispatched.
They got it.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.842
Yeah, but it'll take 'em eight
to 12 minutes to get there.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.478
I mean, this I know,
'cause I do it every day.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.946
We should go.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.382
Can't just pass it by.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.617
Come on.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.693
You guys okay?
You okay?

30:27.726 --> 30:29.695
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.497
-WOMAN: Help! Help!

30:31.530 --> 30:33.199
Just came out of nowhere.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.833
-WOMAN: I need help!
-All right, we should go.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.402
-We should go. Go.
-WOMAN: Help!

30:36.435 --> 30:38.637
WOMAN :
Help!

30:40.672 --> 30:43.042
WOMAN:
Help! Someone help!

30:43.075 --> 30:44.843
-Can you
please help me? Please help.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.312
There's a power line
that fell into the water,

30:46.345 --> 30:48.214
and Alex jumped in
to try to save the baby.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.017
-He's the manny.
-Manny.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.152
: Oh, my...

30:53.185 --> 30:55.254
-MAN: Lyla! -Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Wait. Stay back.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.389
-Stay back. Stay...
What are you doing?

30:57.423 --> 31:00.359
-Get off of me! -No. Hey, hey,
I'm a firefighter, okay?

31:00.392 --> 31:02.061
You can't see it, but those
power lines are sending

31:02.094 --> 31:03.695
5,000 volts through that water.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.497
Anyone touches it
and they are dead.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.500
-Okay, listen,
listen, I understand. It's okay.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.103
-I'm gonna help.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.572
-Okay. -LYLA: Mama!

31:13.605 --> 31:15.441
You and your wife do everything
you can to make sure

31:15.474 --> 31:17.076
she stays on that float, okay?

31:17.109 --> 31:19.345
Baby, listen, Mommy and Daddy
are right here.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.280
We're gonna come get you. Right
now, okay, you have to stay...

31:21.313 --> 31:24.516
-Can we turn the power off
ourselves? -No. Um...

31:26.818 --> 31:28.955
-Okay, stay there.
-Sweetie, it's okay.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.589
ABBY:
What are you doing?

31:30.622 --> 31:33.192
I'm, uh, I'm gonna ride this
thing out and scoop her up.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.394
No, you're not! Did you get
that from the macho handbook?

31:35.427 --> 31:36.862
That's insane.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.730
Yeah, there's no way
that book actually exists.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.032
Actually, give me your knife.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.800
You have a knife, right?
You're a fireman.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.369
-Give me your knife.
-Yeah, okay, okay.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.205
Quick, quick, quick.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.975
-MAN: Okay. -ABBY: I think...

31:51.577 --> 31:52.911
Here. Take this.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.447
Okay, it's rubber,
so it won't conduct electricity.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.416
Okay, great.
That's good. That's genius.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.817
Okay.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.719
Pull it across. Be careful.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.421
Just go slow.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.292
Okay, baby? Baby.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.559
Do you see this?

32:07.593 --> 32:10.129
Can you grab this for Mommy?
Can you grab that?

32:10.162 --> 32:12.498
-Oh, you're such a good girl.
Don't let go, okay? -Good job.

32:12.531 --> 32:13.499
Oh, my God!

32:13.532 --> 32:15.167
-It's okay.
-ABBY: It's okay, it's okay.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.236
-We're good. We're good.
-Hold on. Hold on, sweetie.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.170
Hold on tight.

32:18.204 --> 32:20.072
-There you go.
-Oh, my God. -Hold tight.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.307
-Be careful, Buck.
-Here we go.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.609
WOMAN:
You're doing such a good job.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.943
Hold on.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.845
Okay, keep holding.
All the way over.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.014
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.915
Don't go in the water.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.850
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.119
MAN:
Oh, my God.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.920
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Oh, please.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.256
: Baby.
-Oh.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.091
-Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. -Yeah.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.759
-DWP cut the power.
-Thank you so much.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.860
We're all clear.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.762
-Oh, my...
-Great. Thank you.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.097
Thanks, guys. How you doing?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.432
-Good job. -Good to see you.
Thank you, man.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.468
-Good to see you guys. Yeah.
-You, too.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.103
You were so brave.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.771
-Okay.
-Better. Better.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.540
WOMAN:
Thank you.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.542
Thank you so much.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.777
-Good job.
-Thanks.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.513
What?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.382
Nothing.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.717
ABBY:
That was so exhilarating.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.620
I mean, I'm usually miles away
on the other end of a phone.

33:08.654 --> 33:09.855
You get to do that every day.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.490
Such a high.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.193
Well, you were really good.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.661
Thanks.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.168
I know.

33:22.201 --> 33:25.104
-Let's go find her.
-Yeah.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.984
So, um, you asked

33:39.017 --> 33:41.220
what I was looking at before,
right?

33:41.253 --> 33:43.722
When we, when we high

33:43.755 --> 33:46.658
It was your hands.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.195
See, in an emergency situation,

33:49.228 --> 33:51.897
the body produces adrenaline.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.166
Uh, keeps your mind focused,

33:54.200 --> 33:57.836
dulls any pain,
makes you super strong.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.339
It's a normal human response.

34:00.372 --> 34:04.510
My first few calls,
I was shaking like crazy

34:04.543 --> 34:06.345
for an hour after.

34:06.378 --> 34:10.216
Your hands, they never shook.

34:10.249 --> 34:13.552
I mean, you were like
a full-on Jedi.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.624
Well, I do have some experience
with stress.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.592
Sure.

34:22.228 --> 34:25.631
But also,
I feel calm around you.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.237
Uh, hey. Sergeant.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.038
Uh, did

34:33.071 --> 34:34.540
ATHENA:
A woman fitting her description

34:34.573 --> 34:37.976
was brought into County General
about 20 minutes ago.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.117
Hey, Abby. Athena.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.385
Hey, is she, uh... is she okay?

34:46.418 --> 34:47.819
Doctor's looking at her now.

34:47.853 --> 34:48.954
-Yeah.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.322
-I'm Abby Clark.
-You guys have actually met.

34:50.356 --> 34:51.823
Abby was the 911 dispatcher

34:51.857 --> 34:53.058
on that home invasion
in Winnetka.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.326
Oh, no fooling. Okay.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.295
Well, um, I'm still trying
to get the story

34:56.328 --> 34:58.464
on what happened to her,
but, um, seems like your mother

34:58.497 --> 35:01.233
made it all the way
to South Los Angeles.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.901
These fellas brought her in.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.570
Um, thank you guys so much.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.139
Was she hurt?
-Nah.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.408
She was confused and agitated.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.477
She didn't belong there.
You could tell.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.511
So we brought her here.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.146
I've seen it before
with my abuelita.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.981
And I'm sorry to say,

35:16.014 --> 35:17.583
but it doesn't get no better.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.084
Thank you so much.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.620
No problem.
No problem whatsoever.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.754
PATRICIA:
Abby.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.490
-Mom.
-Abby.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.991
-Mom.
-Oh.

35:26.024 --> 35:28.827
-Oh.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.863
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.133
-It's okay, Mom.
-Oh. Oh.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.703
ABBY:
It's okay.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.446
-Okay, Mom. Okay.
-Okay.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.352
Is this Tommy?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.822
Did you cut your hair
differently?

35:56.855 --> 35:58.457
Mom, that's not Tommy.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.659
Um, I broke up with Tommy.
That's Buck.

36:00.692 --> 36:03.028
He was the one
who helped me find you.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.732
Where did I go?

36:10.336 --> 36:13.004
I'm just gonna
walk him out, okay?

36:13.038 --> 36:15.073
And I'll be right back. Okay.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.343
-I'm just... I'm...
-Okay.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.711
It was, uh, it was nice
to meet you, Ms. Clark.

36:19.745 --> 36:23.482
Thank you. Um...

36:23.515 --> 36:25.083
Be kind to her.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.519
-ABBY: Okay. Um...

36:27.553 --> 36:29.588
-All right. Listen, now,
be safe, okay? -Okay. Bye.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.089
Take care.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.828
-Be right back.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.898
So, that is the most amount
of time I have ever spent

36:39.931 --> 36:41.667
with a woman
I want to have sex with

36:41.700 --> 36:44.603
-without actually having sex
with her.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.272
It's that nightdress.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.574
-It's just so hot.

36:52.311 --> 36:56.248
Well, I guess
we should probably just...

36:56.282 --> 36:59.618
go back to being
phone buddies again.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.052
Why?

37:01.086 --> 37:03.522
Because I like hanging out
with you, too,

37:03.555 --> 37:06.858
and I think that if we continue
to hang out, we will...

37:06.892 --> 37:09.761
Mistakes will be made.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.197
But I do want to say
thank you so much for today,

37:12.230 --> 37:14.600
and not just for what you did

37:14.633 --> 37:18.537
for my mom and for me,
which was amazing.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.607
But you really gave me back
a piece of myself.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.442
You're the first person
in a long time

37:23.475 --> 37:26.545
to show me that I exist
outside of this house

37:26.578 --> 37:30.449
and away from this hospital bed
and the frustration.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.750
So thanks.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.085
Well, then, you're very welcome.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.654
Really.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.374
And no matter what
you're feeling right now...

37:57.676 --> 38:00.011
...don't go have sex
with some girl on Tinder.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.516
-You were thinking about it.
-Mmm.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.019
I'll call you.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.821
Okay.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.628
-Thank you.
-Bye.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.230
-Good night.
-Good night.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.656
It is a beautiful day,
Henrietta.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.991
My love.

38:46.024 --> 38:49.127
Call me Henrietta again,
you're going over the balcony.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.296
Okay, then. Bobby.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.465
Oh, captain,
my handsome captain.

38:53.499 --> 38:54.900
What are you, high?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.167
No, I'm not high.

38:56.201 --> 38:57.202
I met a woman.

38:57.235 --> 38:58.303
Two, actually.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.305
I met a woman and her mother.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.174
And I didn't have sex
with either of them.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.180
Ooh, why's it so cold in here?

39:22.961 --> 39:24.563
I have told him a million times,

39:24.596 --> 39:26.865
wait for everything
to be shut off

39:26.898 --> 39:29.167
before you hose down the place.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.769
But does he listen? No.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.604
He doesn't listen.
You know what happens?

39:32.638 --> 39:34.840
This. This is what happens.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.074
Sir, can you hear me?

39:36.107 --> 39:38.176
Um, yeah.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.078
Does anything feel broken?

39:40.111 --> 39:41.447
Uh, you want to maybe wait

39:41.480 --> 39:44.049
until I decide
he's okay to be moved?

39:44.082 --> 39:45.517
Be glad when Chimney gets back.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.786
We'll all be glad for that.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.228
Run it again!

39:57.262 --> 39:59.030
-Hey.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.032
-This is a good one. You got to
see this.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.134
All right, play the tape.
Come on, one more time.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.903
Wait for it. Wait for it.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.371
Oh, crap.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.640
No, no, no, no, no!

40:08.674 --> 40:10.576
Buck, that man could have been
seriously injured.

40:10.609 --> 40:13.545
-Help! Help! Help!
-HEN: Listen, this is so...

40:13.579 --> 40:17.248
:
unprofessional.

40:17.282 --> 40:20.218
-HEN: I'm not laughing.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.386
-I'm not.
-Yes!

40:21.419 --> 40:23.321
-Oh, okay.
-I'm not laughing.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.893
HEN:
Oh, man.

40:27.926 --> 40:31.396
I have never seen you
laugh like that.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.265
Well, I wasn't always like this.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.567
So shut down.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.269
What happened, Captain?

40:40.138 --> 40:43.241
I made some mistakes, and I...

40:43.274 --> 40:45.511
lost everything I cared about.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.446
And I moved forward

40:48.480 --> 40:51.416
by never letting anybody
get so important to me

40:51.449 --> 40:53.885
that I had to go through
that kind of loss again.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.689
But apparently I'm not very good
at it, because you,

40:57.723 --> 40:59.591
Buck and Chimney have become
that important to me.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.960
Just let us in, Bobby.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.328
I'll tell you what.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.763
Let's get back to the house.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.964
I'll cook you a delicious meal,

41:05.997 --> 41:07.666
and I'll introduce you
to someone.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.868
Who?

41:09.901 --> 41:11.469
Me.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.366
*

41:53.344 --> 41:54.980
Hey.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.314
BUCK:
Hey.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.817
Can I ask you a question?

41:58.850 --> 41:59.985
Yeah, of course.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.487
Did you want
to have sex with me?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.523
What?

42:05.557 --> 42:07.926
Like, you might have made
a mistake, too, right?

42:07.959 --> 42:10.729
Um, yeah.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.497
I mean...

42:12.530 --> 42:16.167
yeah, definitely.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.403
And, you know, you're...

42:18.436 --> 42:20.839
muscly and...

42:20.872 --> 42:23.008
kind and...

42:23.041 --> 42:26.211
you're fun. Yeah.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.713
And you said we can...

42:27.746 --> 42:30.281
-Yeah.

42:30.315 --> 42:33.585
Are you in bed? I'm in bed.

42:33.619 --> 42:36.021
Yeah, I'm in bed.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.122
What are you wearing?

42:37.155 --> 42:39.457
* Open skin

42:39.490 --> 42:41.059
* I wait on you

42:42.427 --> 42:44.863
I don't think
this is exactly the spirit

42:44.896 --> 42:46.431
of what I meant.

42:46.464 --> 42:48.934
Do you want me to stop?

42:48.967 --> 42:49.935
No.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.469
