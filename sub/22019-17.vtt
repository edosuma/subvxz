♪ ...but you would have found ♪

00:23.499 --> 00:27.301
♪ that you are on my mind... ♪

01:05.875 --> 01:07.941
Ooh...

01:19.822 --> 01:22.089
There you go.

03:20.559 --> 03:24.063
“Masks are wonderfully
paradoxical in this way.

03:24.469 --> 03:26.703
“While they may hide
the physical reality,

03:26.705 --> 03:30.540
they can show us how a
person wants to be seen.”

03:30.542 --> 03:32.275
Joanna Scott.

03:32.477 --> 03:36.913
Ok, ok. And by ok, I
mean the abbreviation

03:36.915 --> 03:39.049
of the great state of Oklahoma,

03:39.051 --> 03:40.617
'cause everything I'm gonna say now

03:40.619 --> 03:42.385
is not ok.

03:42.387 --> 03:43.753
The unsub we are looking for

03:43.755 --> 03:45.622
killed last week in Colorado

03:45.624 --> 03:48.258
and then again last night in Oklahoma.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.926
Big mistake. Crossing state lines

03:49.928 --> 03:51.394
gives us jurisdiction.

03:51.396 --> 03:54.097
Attacking in two states is ambitious.

03:54.099 --> 03:56.199
Maybe he's a truck driver or
has other work in the area?

03:56.201 --> 03:58.969
I can check the highway
serial killer database.

03:58.971 --> 04:01.304
So our latest
victim, Mark Wilson, 35,

04:01.306 --> 04:02.939
was beaten to death in his home,

04:02.941 --> 04:05.375
like our first victim, Sam Franklin.

04:05.377 --> 04:09.079
They were both
hard-working Midwestern men.

04:09.081 --> 04:11.481
Both homes were robbed,
and you know that

04:11.483 --> 04:14.017
super-sensitive side
of your mouth part here?

04:14.019 --> 04:16.887
On both of them, it was cut.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.122
Are they smiling?

04:19.124 --> 04:20.957
How did he do that?

04:20.959 --> 04:22.325
That's awful.

04:22.327 --> 04:24.160
This wasn't about
inflicting more pain.

04:24.162 --> 04:25.328
I mean, they were already dead.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.130
He was compelled to do this.

04:27.132 --> 04:28.231
He's got a type.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.933
Strong married men with kids.

04:29.935 --> 04:31.067
It could be a surrogate.

04:31.069 --> 04:32.335
He's got patricidal tendencies,

04:32.337 --> 04:34.037
shows power-assertive behavior.

04:34.039 --> 04:36.273
At first glance, he feels
like a family annihilator

04:36.275 --> 04:37.874
attacking the home, but he's not killing

04:37.876 --> 04:39.209
the whole family.

04:39.211 --> 04:41.077
And he chooses to destroy
the heads of household

04:41.079 --> 04:42.445
without an audience.

04:42.447 --> 04:44.381
There could be some
mercy in him after all.

04:44.383 --> 04:47.284
Well, that might
be true with Sam Franklin,

04:47.286 --> 04:50.420
but with Mark Wilson,
his 7-year-old son Dylan

04:50.422 --> 04:52.289
saw the whole thing.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.990
Oh, no.

04:53.992 --> 04:55.225
Is he talking?

04:55.227 --> 04:58.061
Well, he was, but not anymore.

04:58.063 --> 04:59.329
It's unclear what he saw,

04:59.331 --> 05:04.134
but he says his dad
was killed by a clown.

05:04.136 --> 05:06.303
Maybe the unsub wore a disguise.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.305
Or he's projecting something he fears.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.773
There's a word, even
though it's not recognized

05:09.775 --> 05:12.008
by any dictionary or psychology manual,

05:12.010 --> 05:14.311
for the excessive fear
of clowns... coulrophobia.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.513
Well, whatever
he saw, we need to find out

05:16.515 --> 05:18.081
if it was real or perceived.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.685
Wheels up in 20.

05:23.288 --> 05:25.989
I got officers searching
pawn shops in the area

05:25.991 --> 05:27.190
but came up empty.

05:27.192 --> 05:29.693
Sorry if you got a few stares.

05:29.695 --> 05:32.662
Last time the feds were here
was when they caught McVeigh.

05:32.664 --> 05:34.197
We got you set up over here.

05:34.199 --> 05:36.095
Thank you.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.501
Yeah, I saw what this psycho did

05:38.503 --> 05:39.703
to the vic's mouth.

05:39.705 --> 05:41.938
I figured it wasn't his first time.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.807
So that's when I ran it through ViCAP,

05:43.809 --> 05:45.742
and it was time to call you.

05:45.744 --> 05:48.478
Are you the one who responded
to the Wilson residence?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.914
Yeah. And, of course,
I found Dylan Wilson

05:50.916 --> 05:52.816
hiding in his bedroom.

05:52.818 --> 05:54.584
He called 911?

05:54.586 --> 05:58.021
Yeah, but not until the sun came up.

05:58.023 --> 06:01.424
I'm sure he was too
afraid to make a sound.

06:01.426 --> 06:02.892
Time of death was midnight.

06:02.894 --> 06:06.229
He was in that house with
his dead father for hours.

06:06.231 --> 06:08.832
No wonder he isn't talking.

06:10.869 --> 06:14.204
Woman, on P.A.: Outpatient
pharmacy, dial 621.

06:14.206 --> 06:18.074
Outpatient pharmacy, dial 621.

06:18.076 --> 06:22.078
Hi. Mrs. Wilson, we're Agents
Reid and Simmons from Quantico.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.413
Hi.

06:23.415 --> 06:25.582
We're so sorry for your loss.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.718
Before he stopped talking,

06:28.720 --> 06:31.688
he said he wish he'd
called for help sooner.

06:31.690 --> 06:34.457
Irrational guilt,
especially for a child,

06:34.459 --> 06:36.726
is common after a traumatic event.

06:36.728 --> 06:39.162
Is he gonna talk again?

06:39.164 --> 06:41.631
The doctors here can't tell me.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.466
Most likely, but what he's doing

06:43.468 --> 06:44.901
is called disassociating.

06:44.903 --> 06:48.271
It's a psychological
form of self-protection.

06:48.273 --> 06:49.639
You mind if I talk to him?

06:49.641 --> 06:52.008
Please.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.482
Hi, Dylan.

06:59.484 --> 07:02.452
My name's Spencer.

07:02.454 --> 07:05.588
I'm really sorry about
what happened to your dad.

07:05.590 --> 07:10.060
I can't imagine how
scary that must have been.

07:12.898 --> 07:16.299
I heard who you saw, and I was hoping...

07:16.301 --> 07:18.968
Maybe you could draw me a picture?

07:32.617 --> 07:34.250
Unh!

07:35.120 --> 07:36.586
Uhh!

07:52.204 --> 07:55.638
So he parked in front of the
house instead of the garage.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.340
If he was carrying a sleeping Dylan,

07:57.342 --> 07:59.242
it would have been
the fastest way inside.

07:59.244 --> 08:01.845
That's why he missed the
jimmied lock on the garage door.

08:01.847 --> 08:04.013
Unsub's hitting secluded houses.

08:04.015 --> 08:07.083
Mark's entry would have
interrupted the robbery.

08:07.085 --> 08:08.985
So he would have put Dylan in his bed

08:08.987 --> 08:10.987
and then he would have
gone to sleep himself.

08:10.989 --> 08:13.123
Which makes sense, since
the struggle started

08:13.125 --> 08:14.190
in the master bedroom.

08:14.192 --> 08:16.192
But it ended in the living room.

08:16.194 --> 08:17.560
He probably tried to get the violence

08:17.562 --> 08:19.796
as far away from Dylan as he could.

08:19.798 --> 08:22.098
Just like that first kill in Colorado,

08:22.100 --> 08:23.933
he found his murder weapon on the scene.

08:23.935 --> 08:26.669
So this guy's organized,
and yet he is improvising.

08:26.671 --> 08:28.404
Well, he hasn't established a pattern

08:28.406 --> 08:30.607
'cause he's just getting started.

08:30.609 --> 08:32.976
Well, if Dylan saw him,
chances are he saw Dylan, too,

08:32.977 --> 08:34.544
and chose to let him live.

08:34.546 --> 08:36.412
Well, maybe he has boundaries

08:36.414 --> 08:38.376
when it comes to hurting children.

08:39.417 --> 08:43.052
Oy, I got nada on the
highway database, FYI.

08:43.054 --> 08:46.089
But the other task of
finding additional robberies

08:46.091 --> 08:49.192
in those two states, bingo-go-go.

08:49.194 --> 08:50.593
I got 3 robberies

08:50.595 --> 08:52.495
additionally in Colorado

08:52.497 --> 08:55.932
that are linked by a bizarre smiley face

08:55.934 --> 08:57.200
carved into the doors.

08:57.202 --> 08:59.369
Strange his signature would evolve

08:59.371 --> 09:01.471
from carving wood to cutting faces.

09:01.473 --> 09:02.872
Homeowners weren't there?

09:02.874 --> 09:04.774
Hence no homicides.

09:04.776 --> 09:06.376
They're also in equally
hard-to-find spots.

09:06.378 --> 09:08.982
I'm sending you the towns... now.

09:10.315 --> 09:13.082
The houses are all
far off from the interstate.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.885
He must have scouted them
before he burgled them, right?

09:15.887 --> 09:18.688
Not necessarily. They could
be targets of opportunity.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.390
Dark street, dark house.

09:20.392 --> 09:21.891
Well, something triggered him

09:21.893 --> 09:24.894
between his last robbery
and his first murder.

09:24.896 --> 09:28.455
Maybe he's got a
connection to these towns.

10:05.870 --> 10:08.671
Thank you, Dylan.
This is really helpful.

10:08.673 --> 10:11.207
I'm going to show it to my friend, ok?

10:18.016 --> 10:19.415
Looks like a simple plan.

10:19.417 --> 10:22.619
First hit houses in small
towns and keep moving.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.654
Not too bright to leave a calling card

10:24.656 --> 10:26.889
announcing how many
houses they've robbed.

10:26.891 --> 10:28.291
Well, the unsub didn't start out

10:28.293 --> 10:30.460
looking for blood on his
hands, so what changed him?

10:30.462 --> 10:32.262
We should
focus on his first kill.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.298
Sam Franklin from Campo, Colorado.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.433
Worked in a warehouse,
he had a weekend shift

10:37.435 --> 10:39.435
while his family was in Denver.

10:39.437 --> 10:40.870
Any speculation as to what he was doing

10:40.872 --> 10:42.071
the night he was killed?

10:42.073 --> 10:43.606
Well, his wife claims that he called her

10:43.608 --> 10:45.375
on his way home from work.
It was about midnight.

10:45.377 --> 10:47.910
He told her he was almost T-boned,

10:47.912 --> 10:49.946
and the driver lost his mind on him.

10:49.948 --> 10:52.782
She said he was a bit
shaken, which wasn't like him.

10:52.784 --> 10:54.517
Did he say a clown was driving?

10:54.519 --> 10:57.153
He did not. Which is the
first thing you would say

10:57.155 --> 10:58.554
if that's what you saw.

10:58.556 --> 11:02.158
Ok, so do we think a chance
encounter led to murder?

11:02.160 --> 11:05.094
Maybe. Aggravated lethal
road rage mentality

11:05.096 --> 11:06.162
fits our unsub's profile.

11:06.164 --> 11:07.563
What about Mark Wilson?

11:07.565 --> 11:08.898
The house was already broken into

11:08.900 --> 11:10.233
when he got home.

11:10.235 --> 11:11.768
Yeah, it looks like
the unsub's moving south

11:11.770 --> 11:13.102
along small state roads.

11:13.104 --> 11:15.371
Given the accelerated timeline,

11:15.373 --> 11:17.940
his need to leave a signature behind,

11:17.942 --> 11:20.143
it feels like he's on a mission.

11:23.515 --> 11:27.417
Wow! He's not compartmentalizing at all.

11:27.419 --> 11:29.519
Not at all.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.821
Reid, over phone: Dylan
definitely saw a clown.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.923
The level of detail in the costume

11:33.925 --> 11:35.258
suggests something precise,

11:35.260 --> 11:37.126
which makes me feel like
the face would most likely

11:37.128 --> 11:38.594
be hand-painted versus some kind

11:38.596 --> 11:40.063
of mass-distributed mask.

11:40.065 --> 11:42.498
Makes sense, since the
M.E. found greasepaint

11:42.500 --> 11:44.534
under the latest victim's nails.

11:44.536 --> 11:46.669
This is such a specific disguise.

11:46.671 --> 11:48.504
This unsub must have an obsession.

11:48.506 --> 11:51.240
It says a lot that he
went into Mark Wilson's house

11:51.242 --> 11:52.442
with this makeup on him.

11:52.444 --> 11:53.976
I mean, it's like an alter-ego.

11:53.978 --> 11:57.013
That disguise could be
helping him find confidence.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.716
Won't be surprised if he starts a spree.

12:06.224 --> 12:07.690
You keep up that winning streak,

12:07.692 --> 12:09.959
and they're gonna want
all of us on the team.

12:09.961 --> 12:12.395
Ha ha! Scoot into bed.

12:12.397 --> 12:15.531
I will let you snooze
another 10 in the morning.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.474
Off you go.

12:18.236 --> 12:21.170
Oh, way too late for a school night.

12:21.172 --> 12:22.705
I know, but they'll survive.

12:22.707 --> 12:25.041
I'll tell you what...
You may not be tired,

12:25.043 --> 12:27.276
but I am wiped. I'm going to bed.

12:27.278 --> 12:28.478
Good night, sweetheart.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.246
Good night, honey.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.790
Unit 12, unit 12.

12:45.269 --> 12:48.572
He killed both parents this time.

12:48.973 --> 12:51.540
Well, Mom must have tried to stop it

12:51.542 --> 12:53.376
and became collateral damage.

12:53.378 --> 12:56.066
Well, thankfully the
kids didn't witness any of that,

12:56.066 --> 12:57.819
but since nobody saw anything,

12:57.819 --> 12:59.688
we don't know if he was
wearing a disguise this time.

12:59.688 --> 13:02.189
And just like Mark Wilson's house,

13:02.191 --> 13:03.957
he was here when they got home.

13:03.959 --> 13:06.627
So I don't know if he's
hunting them beforehand

13:06.629 --> 13:08.862
or just getting lucky
that they're family men.

13:08.864 --> 13:12.299
An accidental annihilator
leaving a wake of orphans behind.

13:12.301 --> 13:14.701
This is the second time
he spared their lives

13:14.703 --> 13:16.370
when he clearly didn't need to.

13:16.372 --> 13:20.422
Still, he's punishing them,
making their worst fears come true.

13:20.442 --> 13:23.677
Maybe he has his own
abandonment issues or...

13:23.679 --> 13:26.346
I don't know, maybe we're
missing something here.

13:28.584 --> 13:30.684
If he had a submissive partner,

13:30.686 --> 13:32.986
then they could be the influence

13:32.988 --> 13:34.254
in keeping the kids alive.

13:34.256 --> 13:36.290
So he kills strong male figures

13:36.292 --> 13:38.625
to prove his dominance?

13:38.627 --> 13:39.960
But that's not enough,

13:39.962 --> 13:42.095
so he feels compelled
to cut their mouths.

13:42.097 --> 13:45.799
He wants to make sure he leaves
them with a permanent scar.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.334
So maybe he grew up abused.

13:47.336 --> 13:49.403
He could even have the same scar.

13:49.405 --> 13:51.872
And if that trauma happened

13:51.874 --> 13:53.440
while his love map was forming,

13:53.442 --> 13:56.410
he would think that's the
only way to gain dominance.

13:56.412 --> 13:58.779
A neighbor witnessed
a guy dressed as a clown

13:58.781 --> 14:01.081
running out of the house
and jumping in a van.

14:01.083 --> 14:05.021
Thing is, there was another guy driving.

14:06.956 --> 14:09.456
Thanks.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.458
We blocked off 412...

14:11.460 --> 14:13.794
Pull forward, please!

14:16.832 --> 14:19.467
Oh, no.

14:20.169 --> 14:23.103
What are we gonna do?
They got a roadblock.

14:23.105 --> 14:25.005
We're totally screwed.

14:25.007 --> 14:28.408
Ah, what kind
of negative crap is that?

14:28.410 --> 14:30.277
We're challenged.

14:30.279 --> 14:34.381
I told you, we should have
finished our night and gone back.

14:34.383 --> 14:37.317
Why'd you have to
break in again at night?

14:37.319 --> 14:40.687
I got wound up. Plus I heard
a guy talking about that spot.

14:43.025 --> 14:45.325
It paid off, didn't it?

14:45.327 --> 14:48.261
Doing this two nights in a row is crazy.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.167
Don't call me that.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.601
I'm sorry, but...

14:54.603 --> 14:56.536
You just can't get so greedy.

14:56.538 --> 14:59.906
We are not gonna get caught.

15:03.078 --> 15:05.312
What the hell is that, blood?

15:05.314 --> 15:06.680
You said nobody got hurt.

15:06.682 --> 15:09.783
Guy was popping off at the mouth.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.151
I had to shut him up.

15:11.153 --> 15:15.322
In, out, on our way. That was the deal.

15:15.324 --> 15:17.024
No fighting.

15:17.026 --> 15:19.126
Yeah, well, you're too weak

15:19.128 --> 15:23.186
to be in there with me, aren't you?

15:26.802 --> 15:28.602
Gotta do what I gotta do.

15:28.604 --> 15:33.092
Now turn the van around and let's go.

15:46.555 --> 15:48.321
What are those?

15:48.323 --> 15:50.757
Hoping to find one that
looks like Dylan's drawing.

15:50.759 --> 15:53.827
Are those clown faces painted on eggs?

15:53.829 --> 15:55.862
The tradition was
started after World War II

15:55.864 --> 15:58.532
by a London circus
clown called Stan Bult.

15:58.534 --> 16:00.167
He wanted all professional clowns

16:00.169 --> 16:03.637
to be able to copyright their
costumes and makeup designs.

16:03.639 --> 16:06.139
There's over 300 of them on display

16:06.141 --> 16:08.743
in the English village of Wookey Hole.

16:09.445 --> 16:11.812
I hope they help.

16:12.881 --> 16:15.282
Thank you for staying.

16:15.284 --> 16:18.348
He seems better with you here.

16:18.887 --> 16:21.221
I'm just glad he's finally resting.

16:21.223 --> 16:22.756
Mmm.

16:25.227 --> 16:29.362
I don't know how we're
gonna get through this.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.932
I mean, just knowing what he saw.

16:31.934 --> 16:34.334
I wish I could
trade places with him,

16:34.336 --> 16:35.602
but I don't know...

16:35.604 --> 16:38.805
How I'm gonna get him through this.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.310
After something traumatic happens,

16:43.312 --> 16:45.946
I don't know about you, but I find

16:45.948 --> 16:48.615
that there's always that...

16:48.617 --> 16:51.284
Little moment right when
you wake up in the morning

16:51.286 --> 16:53.286
when everything's good,

16:53.288 --> 16:56.223
because your mind has
temporarily forgotten

16:56.225 --> 16:57.724
the bad stuff.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.459
You ever have that?

16:59.461 --> 17:02.562
After my dad died, yeah.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.598
I feel like our
conscious and subconscious

17:04.599 --> 17:06.066
make some sort of secret pact

17:06.068 --> 17:09.836
to let us have a split-second of peace.

17:09.838 --> 17:11.570
You had that a lot?

17:14.443 --> 17:17.109
When that relief happens,

17:17.112 --> 17:19.980
I try to hold onto it.

17:19.982 --> 17:23.916
You just have to figure out
a way to help Dylan do that.

17:24.619 --> 17:26.720
How?

17:26.722 --> 17:28.355
Let him know that he's not alone

17:28.357 --> 17:31.089
and that his healing
is just gonna take time.

17:31.493 --> 17:35.199
When he's ready to talk, he will.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.666
Physical
and behavioral evidence

17:39.668 --> 17:42.302
points to a dominant
power-assertive male

17:42.304 --> 17:43.803
robbing and killing,

17:43.805 --> 17:46.540
but we also believe there
is a submissive partner

17:46.542 --> 17:48.208
who drives the getaway vehicle.

17:48.210 --> 17:51.211
We're looking for two men
in their 30s driving a van.

17:51.213 --> 17:54.214
The dominant partner
likes to kill with his bare hands,

17:54.216 --> 17:57.050
and his signature is cutting
his victims postmortem.

17:57.052 --> 17:59.953
Any chance the submissive
doesn't know what the dominant's doing?

17:59.955 --> 18:02.656
Absolutely. It's common
for criminal partners

18:02.658 --> 18:04.090
to keep secrets from one another.

18:04.092 --> 18:06.426
The kids seem to be a
complex part of this puzzle.

18:06.428 --> 18:08.195
The dominant's working
alone in the kills,

18:08.197 --> 18:10.397
choosing not to physically
harm the children.

18:10.399 --> 18:12.032
It could be the submissive's influence.

18:12.034 --> 18:14.301
There might be a child in their lives

18:14.303 --> 18:16.870
or unresolved issues
from their own childhoods.

18:16.872 --> 18:18.705
And we can't ignore the
elephant in the room.

18:18.707 --> 18:21.775
More than one eyewitness has
talked about a clown disguise.

18:21.777 --> 18:24.411
Now, that could be a
forensic countermeasure,

18:24.413 --> 18:27.013
but choosing it tells us about him.

18:27.015 --> 18:29.282
When unsubs wear masks,

18:29.284 --> 18:31.351
or in this case, paint them on,

18:31.353 --> 18:33.486
it is a predictor for
antisocial behavior.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.655
We call this deindividuation.

18:35.657 --> 18:40.260
It allows the offender to be
anonymous and act their worst.

18:40.262 --> 18:42.929
We only know the dominant
has painted his face,

18:42.931 --> 18:45.232
most likely because he hates his own.

18:45.234 --> 18:47.567
- Chief.
- He could have a facial disfigurement

18:47.569 --> 18:49.336
or a speech impediment,

18:49.338 --> 18:52.005
something he can't control
that frustrates him.

18:52.007 --> 18:55.542
Two men matching the witnesses'
description have just been spotted.

18:55.544 --> 18:57.444
Chief?

19:11.526 --> 19:13.627
Ok, go over it.

19:13.629 --> 19:15.161
You'll throw me over 'cause I'm little,

19:15.163 --> 19:17.364
and I'll get stuck alone
'cause you fatsos won't make it.

19:17.366 --> 19:19.099
Then I'm gonna be the one who's dead.

19:19.101 --> 19:21.067
Shut up and do it.

19:21.069 --> 19:23.970
Idiots, follow me.

19:25.774 --> 19:27.707
Hold it for me. Thanks.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.276
Beans, I'm gonna close it on you.

19:29.278 --> 19:31.111
Hurry up, beans. Let's go.

19:31.113 --> 19:33.380
I was here for my
great-aunt Mattie’s funeral.

19:33.382 --> 19:36.016
The crank broke, and the
casket fell to the ground.

19:36.018 --> 19:39.586
And my brother said that
when the lid popped open,

19:39.588 --> 19:42.756
her body was all like...

19:43.892 --> 19:45.959
Shh.

19:45.961 --> 19:47.927
Look.

19:56.672 --> 19:58.079
Run!

20:02.010 --> 20:05.824
FBI! Hands
where we can see them!

20:09.251 --> 20:10.784
Hands up, clown.

20:16.825 --> 20:19.059
They took all my stuff.

20:19.061 --> 20:21.447
Oh, you'll get it back.

20:21.697 --> 20:24.169
But you're gonna be here for a while.

20:25.867 --> 20:29.169
So this isn't your
only trespassing charge.

20:29.171 --> 20:32.205
I gotta ask, why did you do it?

20:32.207 --> 20:34.708
I'm a telemarketer.

20:34.710 --> 20:37.344
I clock in, clock out,

20:37.346 --> 20:40.313
and all day make calls to people

20:40.315 --> 20:41.748
who either reject me

20:41.750 --> 20:44.617
or are too lonely to hang up.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.929
Dressing up gets you attention.

20:48.990 --> 20:52.525
When I go out dressed like this...

20:53.295 --> 20:56.452
I make a difference in someone's night.

20:57.532 --> 20:59.065
My buddy and I, we go together

20:59.067 --> 21:00.433
so it's double the scare.

21:00.435 --> 21:01.868
And you know what?

21:01.870 --> 21:03.703
Those kids tonight...

21:03.705 --> 21:05.605
They'll remember me.

21:05.607 --> 21:09.476
We have a man who
is dressing up like a clown

21:09.478 --> 21:12.746
and killing people.

21:12.748 --> 21:15.215
He's clearly a very sick man.

21:15.217 --> 21:17.083
Mm-hmm.

21:19.921 --> 21:22.021
All we have to go by

21:22.023 --> 21:24.357
is this kid's drawing of who he saw.

21:24.359 --> 21:25.859
My partner thinks it's a twist

21:25.861 --> 21:28.661
on a character clown from the 1950s.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.630
You ever seen him?

21:30.632 --> 21:33.032
No, I'd remember a guy like that.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.476
They closed the road
and the gig went late

21:43.478 --> 21:45.345
is why I didn't make it home last night.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.180
Where did you stay?

21:47.182 --> 21:48.481
In the van.

21:48.483 --> 21:50.183
So do you really think
you've made enough

21:50.185 --> 21:53.386
for us to, you know, call
it a day and head south?

21:53.388 --> 21:56.756
Yeah. I'm ready for the Florida sun.

21:56.758 --> 21:58.358
How about you?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.926
My parents called.
They said they found us

21:59.928 --> 22:02.162
a little trailer, under 500 a month.

22:02.164 --> 22:03.596
Great school for Mikey.

22:03.598 --> 22:05.432
Well, we got enough

22:05.434 --> 22:07.100
for the first couple months,

22:07.102 --> 22:09.636
until we find a new gig.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.441
Hiya, monkey.

22:15.911 --> 22:18.945
He is magic.

22:21.616 --> 22:22.782
Can I try one?

22:22.784 --> 22:24.017
Pick a color, any color.

22:24.019 --> 22:26.719
Mm-hmm. Mm... Green.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.855
Give it a big blow, ok?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.326
You should stretch it out.

22:33.328 --> 22:34.861
I should have had you stretch it.

22:34.863 --> 22:37.330
Give it a big stretch.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.800
Yeah, like that.

22:42.370 --> 22:43.803
We interrupt our
current programming

22:43.805 --> 22:45.305
with breaking news.

22:45.307 --> 22:47.006
This is the second
home invasion in Guymon.

22:47.008 --> 22:48.641
Each time the children were home

22:48.643 --> 22:50.477
to find their parents dead.

22:50.479 --> 22:53.213
Oh, that is awful!

22:53.615 --> 22:55.582
Hey, that was in Guymon.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.384
Maybe that's why the roads were closed.

23:01.323 --> 23:03.256
You ok, babe?

23:03.258 --> 23:05.024
I think it was just the sandwich.

23:05.026 --> 23:07.293
I need some air.

23:16.505 --> 23:19.105
Tone!

23:19.541 --> 23:21.574
You killed those people?

23:23.345 --> 23:26.079
When that guy came home
with his sleeping kid,

23:26.081 --> 23:28.681
you said that you tied
him up and that was it.

23:30.719 --> 23:33.753
And the family last night?

23:36.024 --> 23:37.490
How many?

23:37.492 --> 23:38.958
3.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.360
Huh?

23:40.362 --> 23:42.929
4. 4.

23:42.931 --> 23:46.566
What the hell is the matter with you?

23:46.568 --> 23:49.626
Just listen to me for a second.

23:50.005 --> 23:52.539
Just...

23:53.608 --> 23:55.608
Listen.

23:57.078 --> 23:58.611
I'm sorry.

23:58.613 --> 24:00.446
Give me my half.

24:00.448 --> 24:02.815
Right now.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.384
Here's the thing.

24:04.386 --> 24:07.820
After work and pawn
shops, we had about 3,200.

24:07.822 --> 24:09.756
3,800.

24:09.758 --> 24:12.625
Yeah.

24:12.627 --> 24:14.928
So I had a lead.

24:14.930 --> 24:18.131
Oh, god, we should be
riding high right now,

24:18.133 --> 24:19.332
but don't worry, we're
gonna get it all back.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.934
You lost it?

24:20.936 --> 24:23.336
Gambling?

24:23.338 --> 24:26.439
We've been at this for weeks.

24:26.441 --> 24:27.540
You lost it?

24:27.542 --> 24:29.108
I got a plan, Tone.

24:29.110 --> 24:31.177
Do you remember the ranch
owner from the other night,

24:31.179 --> 24:33.346
the big guy with the shiny convertible?

24:33.348 --> 24:36.115
I'm not driving you to kill anybody.

24:36.117 --> 24:39.352
I won't hurt anybody

24:39.354 --> 24:42.655
ever again, ok?

24:42.657 --> 24:44.557
We need to get our money back.

24:44.559 --> 24:46.626
And this guy, he's loaded.

24:46.628 --> 24:48.795
He's not even gonna miss it.

24:53.068 --> 24:58.338
You want to get Mikey
down to Florida, right?

25:00.408 --> 25:03.543
Then what choice is there in this, man?

25:05.146 --> 25:07.647
Woman, on P.A.: Charge
nurse on duty to CCU.

25:07.649 --> 25:09.549
Charge nurse on duty to CCU.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.250
Hi, Dylan.

25:11.252 --> 25:13.853
That picture you drew
really helped us a lot.

25:13.855 --> 25:19.459
Is there anything else
you remember about him?

25:19.461 --> 25:22.395
Did he say anything to you?

25:26.468 --> 25:29.068
He was wearing a shirt like that.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.440
Like... like... like denim?

25:34.442 --> 25:38.144
Yeah. He also smelled like horses.

25:38.146 --> 25:42.515
Oh, baby.

25:43.618 --> 25:45.785
Ohh...

25:52.060 --> 25:54.427
I should just wait in the car.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.765
Hey. We'll get twice as
much with you helping me.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.366
And nobody gets hurt.

26:00.368 --> 26:03.002
I already promised.

26:03.004 --> 26:05.171
See? Nobody's even home.

26:05.173 --> 26:06.639
Ha ha ha!

26:06.641 --> 26:09.657
Welcome to the big
leagues, Tony Capilano!

26:28.852 --> 26:30.618
The owner is
in critical condition,

26:30.620 --> 26:32.287
took a gunshot wound to the shoulder.

26:32.289 --> 26:35.557
Now, it looks like they fought,
but the unsubs got scared off.

26:35.559 --> 26:36.991
Rossi, over phone: Nothing stolen?

26:36.993 --> 26:38.426
No, no. They didn't make
it past the threshold.

26:38.428 --> 26:40.295
You said there
was some kind of security.

26:40.297 --> 26:41.830
Yeah. I'm working on
getting that footage now.

26:41.832 --> 26:43.398
Call you back.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.366
These guys have
remained low-tech so far.

26:45.368 --> 26:47.302
They haven't chosen houses
with security systems.

26:47.304 --> 26:49.904
Choosing this house,
especially in the daylight,

26:49.906 --> 26:51.973
it's a risk. They're in a hurry.

26:51.975 --> 26:53.508
Maybe they're finally
getting out of town

26:53.510 --> 26:54.742
and they're sloppy about it.

26:54.744 --> 26:56.644
Then they'll be more haphazard

26:56.646 --> 26:58.012
now that we'll have images of them.

26:58.014 --> 27:00.155
Hey, Spence.

27:00.155 --> 27:01.921
Great news. Dylan is talking

27:01.923 --> 27:03.256
and he's remembering more details.

27:03.258 --> 27:05.324
He said the unsub was wearing denim

27:05.326 --> 27:07.060
and smelled like horses.

27:07.062 --> 27:08.327
That's specific.

27:08.329 --> 27:09.862
If I brought
him in to the station,

27:09.864 --> 27:11.230
I think it might help with his healing.

27:11.232 --> 27:12.632
That's a great idea. Hey, hold on.

27:12.634 --> 27:14.333
Luke just walked in.

27:14.335 --> 27:15.968
So, the M.E. confirmed that the grease

27:15.970 --> 27:17.203
under the victim's fingernails

27:17.205 --> 27:19.205
is a professional-grade stage makeup.

27:19.207 --> 27:21.374
Doesn't seem like
that would be easy to find.

27:21.376 --> 27:22.809
So they're not amateurs.

27:22.811 --> 27:25.044
Well, psychologically,
most clowns believe

27:25.046 --> 27:26.913
it's not just a job, it's who they are.

27:26.915 --> 27:28.514
That's a problem, considering

27:28.516 --> 27:29.982
circuses are going out of business.

27:29.984 --> 27:32.251
All right, Matt just sent
over the security footage.

27:32.253 --> 27:34.493
Spence, I'll forward it to you.

27:40.028 --> 27:42.829
See, now, faced with a surprise,

27:42.831 --> 27:44.697
these guys are incredibly
unsophisticated.

27:44.699 --> 27:47.900
And no surprise the
submissive's instinct is flight,

27:47.902 --> 27:50.069
the dominant's is fight.

27:50.071 --> 27:52.839
If they grew up in this clown culture,

27:52.841 --> 27:54.440
these could be the roles
they've always played.

27:54.442 --> 27:56.175
So maybe they haven't left the area

27:56.177 --> 27:57.977
because they found some
kind of circus work here.

27:57.979 --> 27:59.278
Hey, Garcia?

27:59.280 --> 28:01.114
Little boy is talking
again? Thank the stars.

28:01.116 --> 28:02.548
Yes. He's made some progress.

28:03.281 --> 28:04.514
So have we.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.616
Can you cross the geo-profiles

28:06.618 --> 28:08.785
from the initial crimes
in Colorado and Oklahoma,

28:08.787 --> 28:11.054
see if any traveling
circuses or carnivals

28:11.056 --> 28:12.093
went through those towns?

28:12.190 --> 28:13.623
I love a carnival.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.391
If it wasn't for the
whole nefarious people

28:15.393 --> 28:16.559
are probably working there,

28:16.561 --> 28:18.141
this would be a most enjoyable search.

28:18.141 --> 28:20.831
Nefarious ruins everything.
I'll hit you back.

28:22.345 --> 28:24.779
W-why'd you have to shoot him?

28:24.781 --> 28:27.849
Our faces are gonna
be all over the news.

28:27.851 --> 28:30.185
We gotta get out of here!

28:30.187 --> 28:32.153
Where are we gonna go?

28:32.155 --> 28:33.955
We don't have any money, remember?

28:33.957 --> 28:35.323
Enough with the “we.”

28:35.325 --> 28:37.659
Y-you messed this up.

28:37.661 --> 28:40.395
Not “we.” I have a wife

28:40.397 --> 28:42.463
and a kid to take care of,

28:42.465 --> 28:45.300
and you don't.

28:45.302 --> 28:47.168
I've been your family all your life,

28:47.170 --> 28:49.007
and now, what?

28:52.309 --> 28:55.210
I let Dad beat on me instead.

28:57.839 --> 29:02.676
I got... I got this so
you wouldn't have to.

29:10.218 --> 29:12.656
Good luck.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.289
Once a Ringling Bros closed,

29:17.291 --> 29:18.924
a lot of the smaller ones folded, too.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.193
But it turns out this was
a huge family business,

29:21.195 --> 29:24.263
generations born and
raised in this world.

29:24.265 --> 29:26.232
It's dying off. I don't really
have anything to offer you.

29:26.234 --> 29:28.934
Ok, well, look, think
about their timeline.

29:28.936 --> 29:32.071
They're wearing denim,
they have made-up faces,

29:32.073 --> 29:33.672
smelling like horses.

29:33.674 --> 29:35.908
What if it's less
about wearing the masks

29:35.910 --> 29:39.445
as a forensic countermeasure
and more about convenience?

29:39.447 --> 29:43.649
I mean, what if they just
finished some kind of gig close by?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.885
They could be clowns at a rodeo.

29:45.887 --> 29:47.686
Emily, have I complimented you

29:47.688 --> 29:50.022
as of late on your
assertive yet loving way

29:50.024 --> 29:52.558
of pointing out paths I
don't think to go down?

29:52.560 --> 29:55.461
Oh, wow. There's a whole circuit.

29:55.463 --> 29:57.696
Big deal things at civic centers,

29:57.698 --> 29:59.431
smaller ones, too.

29:59.433 --> 30:01.033
There were a whole bunch
last week in Colorado

30:01.035 --> 30:02.601
where our first victim was killed,

30:02.603 --> 30:05.471
and there's one scheduled
tonight in Guymon.

30:05.473 --> 30:07.133
I'm sending you the info now.

30:17.051 --> 30:19.285
These rodeos can employ
hundreds of people.

30:19.287 --> 30:21.453
Yeah. I hope this is our guys.

30:21.455 --> 30:22.721
Can I help you?

30:22.723 --> 30:26.392
Yeah, uh, Agents Jareau and Simmons.

30:26.394 --> 30:28.327
Well, everybody's legal here, ma'am.

30:28.329 --> 30:31.096
Glad to hear. We're wondering

30:31.098 --> 30:34.600
if you... if you ever
employed these men.

30:34.602 --> 30:36.568
We think they may be related.

30:36.570 --> 30:38.070
Well, they're brothers.

30:38.072 --> 30:39.538
It's the Capilanos.

30:39.540 --> 30:40.806
That one there got in a fight

30:40.808 --> 30:42.107
with one of my bull riders.

30:42.109 --> 30:43.809
Tried to cut his face.

30:43.811 --> 30:46.111
So they're banned from working here.

30:46.113 --> 30:47.613
Yeah. Bad luck

30:47.615 --> 30:49.114
follows them around.

30:49.116 --> 30:52.318
I hear they got canned
up in Colorado last week,

30:52.320 --> 30:54.586
but I'm not surprised
with that one's temper.

30:54.588 --> 30:56.588
Do you have any idea where
we might be able to find them?

30:56.590 --> 31:00.426
All us owners, we talk, so their
names are no good around here.

31:00.428 --> 31:02.528
I'm sure they've moved on by now.

31:02.530 --> 31:05.064
Excuse me. I got a show to get ready.

31:05.066 --> 31:06.265
Uh, just one more thing.

31:06.267 --> 31:07.466
If they are blacklisted

31:07.468 --> 31:09.201
from the legitimate circuit, any chance

31:09.203 --> 31:11.337
they'd find work
somewhere off the radar,

31:11.339 --> 31:13.472
like at a coleadero?

31:13.474 --> 31:16.108
A migrant rodeo. They're unregulated.

31:16.110 --> 31:18.844
Sure. If those boys
are desperate enough,

31:18.846 --> 31:20.045
they can work.

31:20.047 --> 31:21.947
Any idea where we could find one?

31:21.949 --> 31:24.483
Well, they keep moving their spots.

31:24.485 --> 31:26.385
They don't want the cops to catch 'em.

31:26.387 --> 31:28.921
All right, well, thanks for your help.

31:30.391 --> 31:31.657
Uh, hey.

31:31.659 --> 31:34.860
Don't tell them I sent you.

31:34.862 --> 31:36.862
We won't.

31:36.864 --> 31:39.231
Ma'am.

31:42.470 --> 31:44.103
Oh, my god.

31:44.105 --> 31:46.538
Do you remember this?

31:46.540 --> 31:49.675
The day we found out we were pregnant.

31:49.677 --> 31:52.211
Ha ha.

31:52.213 --> 31:56.215
I just wish he could
grow up like we did...

31:56.217 --> 31:58.717
The magic of the big top.

31:58.719 --> 32:00.252
You know?

32:00.254 --> 32:02.967
I know, but it's gone.

32:03.257 --> 32:06.381
I think it's time that
we dreamed a new dream.

32:07.261 --> 32:08.994
This is all I know.

32:08.996 --> 32:12.364
No, you've got so many other
skills that'll transfer to work,

32:12.366 --> 32:15.434
and... and I'm a good acrobat.

32:15.436 --> 32:18.003
I could teach gymnastics
down in Florida,

32:18.005 --> 32:20.773
and we'd find something
there for you, too.

32:28.215 --> 32:30.349
This is where you guys have been going?

32:30.351 --> 32:32.317
This and others like it.

32:32.319 --> 32:33.485
I haven't been back to this one

32:33.487 --> 32:35.587
since Sal got us kicked out.

32:35.589 --> 32:37.623
Are you sure this is safe?

32:37.625 --> 32:40.492
Yeah, I'll be careful. I know the boss.

32:40.494 --> 32:43.462
I can make 50 bucks,

32:43.464 --> 32:47.714
get us another 300
miles closer to Florida.

32:48.436 --> 32:49.768
Ok.

32:49.770 --> 32:51.737
Ok.

33:12.993 --> 33:14.626
Hey, Lenny.

33:14.628 --> 33:16.995
Your bastard brother with you?

33:16.997 --> 33:18.797
No, I'm done with him.

33:18.799 --> 33:20.332
Good.

33:20.334 --> 33:21.567
I need a gig.

33:21.569 --> 33:23.335
Full up.

33:23.337 --> 33:24.703
Anything.

33:24.705 --> 33:27.573
My wife and kid are in the van.

33:27.575 --> 33:29.942
We need gas money.

33:29.944 --> 33:31.477
It's the last time I'll be here.

33:31.479 --> 33:34.834
I'll take whatever y-you can spare.

33:35.516 --> 33:38.383
All right. I'll find you something.

33:38.385 --> 33:39.451
Thank you.

33:39.453 --> 33:41.954
Let's go.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.716
Get out of my van.

34:03.718 --> 34:05.117
You're hurting me. Stop!

34:05.119 --> 34:07.145
Oww!

34:07.755 --> 34:09.355
This is all your fault!

34:09.357 --> 34:10.623
Shut up. Mikey's sleeping.

34:10.625 --> 34:13.559
You took Tony away from me.

34:14.045 --> 34:15.946
Wow. Are you drunk?

34:15.947 --> 34:18.681
The Capilano brothers!

34:18.684 --> 34:22.853
Tony has a family. So it's
not all about you anymore.

34:28.527 --> 34:31.228
Let go of me!

34:31.230 --> 34:32.563
Mama?

34:32.565 --> 34:34.831
Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm just
looking for your old man.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.400
Go back to sleep, ok?

34:43.476 --> 34:46.443
All right, we're looking at a dozen
possibilities here. We need help.

34:46.445 --> 34:48.512
Well, we're headed south, so
we should only consider ranches

34:48.514 --> 34:49.980
in that direction.

34:49.982 --> 34:52.216
I wish there was a
paper trail for stuff like this.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.751
It's like the fight club of rodeos.

34:53.753 --> 34:55.786
They're all like, the first
rule of underground rodeos...

34:55.788 --> 34:56.820
Don't talk about underground rodeo.

34:56.822 --> 34:57.624
Exactly.

34:57.723 --> 34:58.856
The unsub's last target

34:58.858 --> 35:00.157
was about 20 miles out of town,

35:00.159 --> 35:01.425
so they couldn't have gone far.

35:01.427 --> 35:03.861
Ok, I've got two ranches
just south of there.

35:03.863 --> 35:05.195
Sending you GPS pins now.

35:05.197 --> 35:06.396
Thanks.

35:06.398 --> 35:09.767
As expected,
Sal and Tony Capilano

35:09.769 --> 35:11.568
have only known the circus life.

35:11.570 --> 35:13.070
After a slow death of the circus,

35:13.072 --> 35:15.139
they lost their jobs for
good a few months ago.

35:15.141 --> 35:16.473
If it was all they knew,

35:16.475 --> 35:18.175
losing their work was
like losing their identity.

35:18.177 --> 35:19.877
Added up to one hell of a stressor.

35:19.879 --> 35:21.445
As if they needed any more,

35:21.447 --> 35:22.846
it's just like we thought.

35:22.848 --> 35:24.948
Dad was an abusive drunk

35:24.950 --> 35:27.451
who killed their mom,
then abandoned them.

35:27.453 --> 35:30.187
They were raised by their
work family after that.

35:30.189 --> 35:33.090
They were orphans, just
like their victims' kids.

35:33.092 --> 35:35.659
Their circus was never
thriving but held to traditions.

35:35.661 --> 35:38.862
Tony was a beloved clown
a la the classic 1950s,

35:38.864 --> 35:40.464
but Sal Capilano never wanted that life.

35:40.466 --> 35:42.332
He was a daredevil,
wanted to be like his dad.

35:42.334 --> 35:44.701
Sal's daredevil outlet dries up,

35:44.703 --> 35:46.970
but he's still chasing
that adrenaline rush.

35:46.972 --> 35:49.606
After they were fired, he
started killing surrogates

35:49.608 --> 35:51.203
for their father.

35:51.644 --> 35:54.878
♪ You should see the other guy ♪

35:54.880 --> 35:56.013
What did you do?

35:56.015 --> 35:57.614
Ohh. What, are you worried now?

35:57.616 --> 35:59.583
Didn't seem to care much
when you just left me behind,

35:59.585 --> 36:00.751
Diana and I.

36:00.753 --> 36:01.718
She's not even family!

36:01.720 --> 36:04.288
She's my wife. My family.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.422
What am I?

36:05.424 --> 36:07.480
You're drunk.

36:07.593 --> 36:09.359
I'm gettin' on the bull.

36:09.361 --> 36:11.295
No, don't do that. Come on, not again.

36:11.297 --> 36:12.429
You're not good at it.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.898
Unlike you, I don't give up.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.635
See, I told Lenny, I
said, my kid brother

36:18.637 --> 36:21.638
and his family abandoned me

36:21.640 --> 36:23.707
after all I did for them!

36:23.709 --> 36:26.009
I'm getting in there
'cause I need the money.

36:26.011 --> 36:27.644
So do I.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.346
Told told you never
to come back here, Sal.

36:29.348 --> 36:30.547
See, that's not gonna happen.

36:30.549 --> 36:32.249
All right, you can give me my money

36:32.251 --> 36:36.019
the honest way, or I can
take it from you, Lenny.

36:42.261 --> 36:45.562
Ha ha ha!

36:45.564 --> 36:47.297
Put it down, Sal.

36:47.299 --> 36:48.765
See, that ain't gonna happen.

36:48.767 --> 36:52.035
You know he's got at least
a couple grand in his safe.

36:52.037 --> 36:53.971
He needs help. Yeah, right.

36:53.973 --> 36:56.073
Come with me. What are you gonna do?

36:56.075 --> 36:57.574
You gonna call the cops?

36:57.576 --> 37:01.743
Well, how you gonna explain it, Tone?

37:02.481 --> 37:05.143
I'm gonna tell them what you did.

37:09.288 --> 37:12.322
They would put you away, too.

37:13.525 --> 37:15.926
All right, go ahead. You go ahead.

37:15.928 --> 37:17.961
You keep making 50 bucks
every couple of days

37:17.963 --> 37:19.096
so you can barely survive.

37:19.098 --> 37:21.098
You think that wife of yours

37:21.100 --> 37:22.466
is gonna stay with you?

37:22.468 --> 37:23.634
Ha ha ha!

37:23.636 --> 37:25.669
She won't!

37:25.671 --> 37:29.172
Hell, you could make
way more than 50 a day

37:29.174 --> 37:31.708
if you just rent her
out to all the guys.

37:35.447 --> 37:37.247
Sal Capilano, FBI!

37:37.249 --> 37:38.615
Hands where we can see them!

37:38.617 --> 37:39.750
Put the gun down!

37:39.752 --> 37:41.184
Oh...

37:41.186 --> 37:43.120
Uh-uh, Tony, no, no.

37:43.122 --> 37:45.184
You don't want to do this.

37:45.224 --> 37:48.225
He killed so many people.

37:48.227 --> 37:49.826
That was his choice.

37:49.828 --> 37:52.396
Now, you have one, too, right now.

37:52.398 --> 37:54.331
Don't do this.

37:54.333 --> 37:56.667
Go ahead, Tone.

37:56.669 --> 37:59.603
You ain't got the
g-g-g-g-g-g-guts.

38:00.773 --> 38:01.905
Ha ha. Oh...

38:01.907 --> 38:03.540
Don't be like him

38:03.542 --> 38:06.043
or your father.

38:06.045 --> 38:08.812
You're a dad now, Tony.

38:08.814 --> 38:13.250
Your son is waiting
for you, and your wife.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.419
Tony, she's so worried.

38:16.722 --> 38:19.122
Don't you want to see them?

38:29.535 --> 38:32.602
Sal Capilano, you're
charged with the murders

38:32.604 --> 38:34.671
of Sam Franklin... get up...

38:34.673 --> 38:36.907
Mark Wilson...

38:37.876 --> 38:40.510
Bella and John Richardson.

38:40.512 --> 38:42.112
You have the right to remain silent.

39:04.203 --> 39:07.871
Do you want to color?

39:07.873 --> 39:10.107
Sure.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.515
What's your name?

39:18.517 --> 39:20.450
Dylan. What's yours?

39:20.452 --> 39:22.452
Mikey.

39:22.454 --> 39:26.367
How long is Tony gonna be away?

39:27.092 --> 39:29.526
Depends.

39:29.528 --> 39:31.261
Ok.

39:32.431 --> 39:36.600
Oh. This, with Mikey,

39:36.602 --> 39:41.204
you know, these past 7
years have gone by so fast.

39:41.206 --> 39:43.573
And even if Tony's gone only a year,

39:43.575 --> 39:46.209
it's gonna seem like a lifetime.

39:46.211 --> 39:48.678
You know, Tony wouldn't hurt anyone,

39:48.680 --> 39:50.347
and he didn't.

39:50.349 --> 39:52.549
It was all Sal. His entire life

39:52.551 --> 39:54.184
Sal has caused trouble, and now Tony's

39:54.186 --> 39:56.286
gonna get punished, too.

40:00.526 --> 40:04.761
Hey. Tony wants to
talk to you and Mikey.

40:04.763 --> 40:06.596
Yeah. Yeah.

40:06.598 --> 40:09.369
Hey, Mikey, buddy.

40:11.003 --> 40:12.402
Bye, Dylan.

40:12.404 --> 40:14.538
Bye.

40:20.846 --> 40:23.213
Hey.

40:26.752 --> 40:29.853
I'm so sorry, buddy.

40:29.855 --> 40:32.255
I gotta go away for a little while,

40:32.257 --> 40:36.359
but you and your mom are
gonna go have fun in Florida.

40:36.361 --> 40:37.594
No, we're gonna stay right here

40:37.596 --> 40:38.995
or wherever you go.

40:38.997 --> 40:40.964
It's just gonna hold you back.

40:40.966 --> 40:42.899
What are you saying?

40:46.672 --> 40:49.940
I could do 5, 10 years for this,

40:49.942 --> 40:52.709
maybe more.

40:52.711 --> 40:55.712
He'll be in high school by then.

40:55.714 --> 41:00.650
And I don't want him to
see me like this again.

41:00.652 --> 41:04.087
You just make sure
that he doesn't forget me.

41:04.089 --> 41:06.523
- Ok?
- No.

41:12.131 --> 41:14.664
Hey!

41:20.105 --> 41:22.205
That's it, buddy.

41:22.207 --> 41:23.840
You got this.

41:29.982 --> 41:32.682
I'm so proud of you.

41:34.453 --> 41:37.154
There he is.

41:40.659 --> 41:43.293
I made this for you.

41:43.295 --> 41:45.095
Thanks.

41:45.097 --> 41:46.396
He's on an adventure

41:46.398 --> 41:47.998
to find his family in the forest.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.200
How much farther
does he have to go?

41:50.202 --> 41:51.701
He doesn't know.

41:51.703 --> 41:53.270
Christopher Marlowe said,

41:53.272 --> 41:56.473
“it lies not in our
power to love or hate.

41:56.475 --> 42:00.410
For will in us is overruled by fate.”
