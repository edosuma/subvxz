00:02.160 --> 00:04.760
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:04.760 --> 00:07.360
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:07.360 --> 00:09.680
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:11.280 --> 00:14.120
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:15.760 --> 00:19.000
Sarah and Duck have just returned from the bread shop

00:19.000 --> 00:22.680
and are getting ready to tuck into some sticky buns.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.880
- Not yet, Duck.
- QUACK!

00:24.880 --> 00:26.800
- BANG!
- Huh?

00:26.800 --> 00:29.480
- What was that?
- Hmm...

00:32.240 --> 00:34.080
- Duck!
- QUACK-QUACK!

00:35.200 --> 00:36.400
QUACK!

00:36.400 --> 00:38.360
BANG!

00:41.040 --> 00:44.240
- Umbrella?
- Erm, hello...

00:44.240 --> 00:48.000
I'm practising my magic tricks.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.120
BANG!

00:50.120 --> 00:52.480
I didn't know you were a magician.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.880
I'm not. But I wrote a letter to my friend, Primrose,

00:55.880 --> 00:58.160
inviting her to see my magic show.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.760
- But...
- But?

01:00.760 --> 01:04.560
- It's harder than it looks.
- Hmm...

01:04.560 --> 01:06.720
Abracadabra!

01:06.720 --> 01:09.320
Magic!

01:13.240 --> 01:15.320
Hm...

01:15.320 --> 01:18.600
Oh... She's not going to like my show.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.200
- We can help.
- Really?

01:20.200 --> 01:23.520
Every great magician needs an assistant.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.720
- QUACK!
- And a stage!

01:25.720 --> 01:29.560
Somewhere mysterious and magical.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.040
What you think, Umbrella?

01:36.520 --> 01:40.240
Whoa! It's perfect.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.080
Nearly...

01:43.080 --> 01:45.800
QUACK!

01:45.800 --> 01:47.800
CRASH!

01:50.960 --> 01:52.920
There.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.720
- Now you REALLY look the part.
- Yes! I do...

01:57.720 --> 02:00.920
- So, what now?
- Practice.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.240
- QUACK!
- Huh? Whoa!

02:11.240 --> 02:14.200
- Of course, the pipes!
- Oh, yeah!

02:14.200 --> 02:19.720
- Well, pipe conductor, every magic show needs music.
- Yes!

02:21.600 --> 02:25.080
PIPES PLAY A TUNE

02:28.960 --> 02:31.560
QUACK!

02:31.560 --> 02:33.560
QUACK! QUACK!

02:38.080 --> 02:40.440
Whoa!

02:41.480 --> 02:44.000
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

02:45.560 --> 02:48.400
QUACK! QUACK!

02:49.520 --> 02:51.440
SQUEAK!

02:51.440 --> 02:53.480
QUACK!

02:56.520 --> 02:59.960
- Huh?
- You didn't say the magic words!

02:59.960 --> 03:01.680
Oh, yeah!

03:01.680 --> 03:03.520
And, erm, really give it

03:03.520 --> 03:05.200
some welly this time.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.760
Hm... Aber-ca-dab-er! Whoa!

03:11.680 --> 03:14.120
- Woo-hoo!
- That did the trick!

03:15.280 --> 03:17.320
Erm, where's the lemon?

03:17.320 --> 03:18.800
QUACK!

03:18.800 --> 03:21.440
Erm, Oh, dear!

03:21.440 --> 03:25.920
Best practice a few more tricks - just in case.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.120
QUACK!

03:36.120 --> 03:38.960
Oh! Hello, fellow!

03:38.960 --> 03:40.800
QUACK!

03:40.800 --> 03:43.200
Very well, Duck.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.760
Whoa!

03:50.520 --> 03:52.920
QUACK!

03:54.520 --> 03:56.960
- SQUEAKING
- Oh, hello!

03:56.960 --> 03:59.600
- Are you here for the magic too?
- SQUEAK!

04:02.600 --> 04:04.400
QUACK! QUACK!

04:05.960 --> 04:09.960
- Ahem-ahem!
- Ladies and, erm, bugs...

04:11.240 --> 04:16.640
Welcome to Umbrella's unbelievably spectacular magic show!

04:16.640 --> 04:18.960
- Hello!
- Ooh!

04:18.960 --> 04:22.720
For my first trick, the mysterious bun!

04:25.880 --> 04:30.080
Empty. Empty. Empty.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.720
A bun!

04:33.720 --> 04:37.160
Ahem! A bun!

04:37.160 --> 04:38.680
Duck!

04:43.160 --> 04:46.000
Keep your eyes on the bun.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.040
Whoa!

04:51.040 --> 04:53.400
QUACK!

04:55.280 --> 04:57.640
Erm, where is the bun?

04:57.640 --> 05:00.040
Middle, of course!

05:00.040 --> 05:02.160
No.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.280
- Oh!
- SQUEAKING

05:06.920 --> 05:08.920
Uh-uh.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.640
It's here! Huh?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.960
Extraordinary!

05:13.960 --> 05:17.000
Yes, extraordinary.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.320
QUACK!

05:18.320 --> 05:22.000
Oh, yes! Magic!

05:22.000 --> 05:27.280
For my next trick, I will float up off the ground.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.200
Ohhhh! Gosh!

05:40.360 --> 05:42.960
QUACK!

05:42.960 --> 05:45.200
- Whoa!
- Huh!

05:45.200 --> 05:47.440
Whoa!

05:47.440 --> 05:49.880
- Ta-dah!
- Whoo!

05:49.880 --> 05:51.960
Again! Again!

05:51.960 --> 05:54.600
- No thanks!
- Top show, chap!

05:54.600 --> 05:57.440
Encore, Encore!

05:57.440 --> 06:01.440
- Encore?
- I think they want more.
- Ah!

06:01.440 --> 06:06.480
For my last trick, I will need a volunteer.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.360
Ohhh!

06:08.360 --> 06:10.200
SQUEAKING

06:10.200 --> 06:12.720
- Me! Please, me! Me!
- Thank you.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.080
Would you mind checking my canopy?

06:16.080 --> 06:18.640
It's empty.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.560
Now, say the magic word, crab-and-a-zebra!

06:22.560 --> 06:24.760
Crab-and-a-zebra?!

06:24.760 --> 06:26.640
Hup!

06:26.640 --> 06:28.960
- Heh!
- Whoa!

06:28.960 --> 06:30.560
Flowers!

06:30.560 --> 06:33.960
- Well, gosh!
- Gosh!

06:33.960 --> 06:38.400
- Now, that's how you finish a show.
- Yes!

06:40.120 --> 06:42.200
- Oh...
- Oops, ha-ha!

06:42.200 --> 06:43.400
Hee-hee-hee!

06:45.400 --> 06:47.720
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

06:49.440 --> 06:51.680
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

06:52.720 --> 06:55.040
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

06:56.040 --> 06:58.240
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!
