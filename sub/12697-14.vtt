[gurgles]

19:41.380 --> 19:43.649
- You need to go home.
- Good, take me there.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.384
- I don't get off work until...

19:45.450 --> 19:46.752
- [door opens]

19:51.223 --> 19:52.791
- Hello, Spencer.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.860
- Hi, Harry. How come--

19:54.927 --> 19:58.196
- Hey, you can't be in here.
I'm working...

19:58.263 --> 19:59.698
Wait.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.733
Harry Joyner the artist?

20:01.800 --> 20:04.970
- Ah ah?
- Indeed.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.206
- Wow, I love your work.
- HARRY: Thank you.

20:08.273 --> 20:12.778
- You stay as long as you want.
- Ah, ah-ha.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.313
- I'll assume that
was a compliment.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.447
Thank you.

20:16.515 --> 20:19.217
- So why are you here?

20:19.284 --> 20:22.120
- Carly came by my
photoshoot today.

20:22.187 --> 20:25.390
She told me you'd decided
to quit being an artist.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.593
- Yeah, I have.
It's okay.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.094
It's not your fault
my art's terrible.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.497
- Your art's not terrible.
It's good.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.133
Great, actually.
- But I thought--

20:35.200 --> 20:37.202
- Then why did you say
you didn't like it?

20:37.269 --> 20:39.237
- Truthfully?

20:39.304 --> 20:42.307
When I saw your work,
I was jealous.

20:42.374 --> 20:45.043
- Jealous? Of me?

20:45.110 --> 20:46.745
- Your sculptures are better

20:46.812 --> 20:49.314
than anything I've done
in a long time.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.786
- [thud]

20:57.889 --> 20:59.524
- Now do you believe
you're talented?

20:59.591 --> 21:03.328
- Spencer, do the world a favor.

21:03.395 --> 21:07.265
Be an artist.
- Okay.

21:09.201 --> 21:13.572
- Hey, uh, if you're as good
as he says that you are,

21:13.639 --> 21:15.374
how about you building me
a sculpture

21:15.440 --> 21:19.211
for my waiting room over there?
I'll pay you a thousand bucks.

21:19.277 --> 21:20.445
- Done!

21:22.381 --> 21:25.717
- Um, would you like a little
help with that project?

21:25.784 --> 21:26.985
- [thud]

21:29.821 --> 21:31.023
- Wait...

21:31.089 --> 21:34.559
you're saying you
wanna work with me?

21:34.626 --> 21:35.827
On a sculpture?

21:35.894 --> 21:38.263
- Only if you don't faint
every time I talk to you.

21:38.330 --> 21:41.667
- ♪

21:41.733 --> 21:43.402
- Do you think I
have too much here?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.536
- Don't ask me.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.204
Just use as much as
you think you need.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.240
- I want your opinion.
- You don't need my opinion.

21:48.306 --> 21:50.976
- I crave your opinion.
- I crave a hamburger.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.445
- I'll make you a hamburger
as soon as we're done.

21:53.512 --> 21:54.913
- Alright.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.081
- I'm home.
- We're here.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.349
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.017
- Wow, you got home
from school fast.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.752
- Sam's mom gave us
a ride home again.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.920
- That was nice of her.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.322
- Nah, she just likes
dumping me here.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.258
- Freddie with you guys?
- SAM: No.

22:06.324 --> 22:08.794
But since Carly's home,
he'll probably be here in--

22:08.860 --> 22:10.228
- What's up?
- --zero seconds.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.633
- I would've been
here sooner, but, uh,

22:14.700 --> 22:16.935
I was helping my
mom knit a sweater.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.336
Any comment?

22:20.338 --> 22:22.174
- Please let me insult
you once for free.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.676
- Nope.
5 bucks an insult.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.078
- Then I think it's very sweet

22:26.144 --> 22:27.946
you were helping
your mommy knit.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.849
- Impressive.
- You're just lucky I'm broke.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.284
- The sculpture's
looking awesome.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.152
- That dentist dude's
really gonna pay you

22:34.219 --> 22:37.055
1,000 bucks for that?
- Paid in advance!

22:37.122 --> 22:38.423
- Cash.
- Sweet.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.592
- Since you guys helped
me get my art career back,

22:40.659 --> 22:43.628
40 for you, 40 for you,

22:43.695 --> 22:47.032
and 41 for my little sister.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.500
- Aw, I'm special.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.071
- And now that I
have 40 bucks...

22:53.138 --> 22:54.372
you're a nerd.
- Thank you.

22:54.439 --> 22:55.874
- Your breath smells
like dead feet.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.309
No girl will ever want you.
- Noted.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.277
- I don't like your pants.
- Fair enough.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.179
- If you were a country,
you'd be El Salva-dork.

fun of your butt yet?

- It's oddly shaped.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.319
{\an8}So is your head.
- Awesome.

23:12.591 --> 23:13.825
- Remember my cousin Greg?

23:13.892 --> 23:16.061
- The dude who plays
the flute and beatboxes?

23:16.128 --> 23:19.231
