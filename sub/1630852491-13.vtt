00:01.169 --> 00:02.870
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.970 --> 00:04.505
My time with you is just--

00:04.605 --> 00:07.241
it's just been
the happiest time of my life.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.677
What do you say
we make it official?

00:09.777 --> 00:11.879
I am so, so happy for you.

00:12.012 --> 00:12.880
Thank you.

00:13.013 --> 00:17.285
And for you, too... Philip.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.387
Thank you.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.954
-Come on. Hey, no,
I just need to know...
-Get out.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.423
-...if movie quotes
or impressions are allowed.
-No.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.591
-That's all.
-KATE: Yes.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.193
This is the last time
I'm doing this,

00:25.293 --> 00:27.195
so go crazy, brother.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.231
("Long Cool Woman"
by The Hollies plays)

00:30.364 --> 00:32.466
(kids laughing)

00:33.701 --> 00:35.035
REBECCA:
Guys,

00:35.136 --> 00:37.538
can we please eat our breakfast
like normal human beings?

00:40.541 --> 00:43.043
Hey, I mean it.
You're not puppies.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.545
(all barking)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.383
(all howling)

00:51.552 --> 00:54.122
(howling continues)

00:54.222 --> 00:55.489
(sighs)

00:57.091 --> 01:01.129
* Saturday night I was downtown,
working for... *

01:01.229 --> 01:03.631
Right on time, Ms. Pearson.
Just like clockwork.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.999
-Come on, kids.
-(exhales)

01:06.100 --> 01:08.336
* Whiskey bottles
piling high... *

01:08.469 --> 01:09.770
Hi, I'd like...

01:09.870 --> 01:12.106
-Pound of ham.
-Hey, pound of ham.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.641
Coming right up.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.443
* Bootlegging boozer
on the west side *

01:15.543 --> 01:16.777
Thank you.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.647
* People who are doing wrong *

01:19.747 --> 01:22.283
* Just about to call up
the D.A. man *

01:22.383 --> 01:26.120
* When I heard this woman
sing a song *

01:28.088 --> 01:30.458
* A pair of 45s made me
open my eyes... *

01:30.558 --> 01:31.859
HAIRDRESSER:
The usual?

01:31.992 --> 01:33.927
Actually, no.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.364
* Rise *

01:36.497 --> 01:37.998
Let's try something different.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.000
* Long, cool woman
in a black dress... *

01:40.100 --> 01:42.370
HAIRDRESSER:
All right. (chuckles)

01:43.371 --> 01:47.508
* With just one look,
I was a bad mess... *

01:47.608 --> 01:50.344
I'm sorry, but I don't need
my hair done today.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.548
Wh-- Uh, honey.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.851
Remember, we are going
to Kate's wedding today.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.154
And Kelly here
is gonna style your hair.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.022
But maybe not too glamorous,
because we don't want

02:02.156 --> 02:04.358
to upstage Kate
at her own wedding, now do we?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.860
What do you think?

02:08.829 --> 02:11.365
Yes, Kate's wedding. Okay.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.133
Okay.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.871
I know, I know.
I'm getting dressed,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.039
but the wife wanted stockings.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.508
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.210
I got him, it's all good.
Let's move, Nicky.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.578
-Move.
-Loved the article, by the way.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.380
-Hated the picture.
-Oh, you know
I looked good, brother.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.250
(knocking on door)

02:29.350 --> 02:31.319
Yo. Morning, Miguel.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.421
Randall, wow.
You polish up real nice.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.324
-Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
-Wow, look at that.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.591
-RANDALL: Hey, Mom.
-Hi.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.661
-You excited for the day?
-Mm-hmm.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.364
Now remember, after I finish
with my reception toast,

02:43.464 --> 02:45.999
I'm gonna call you up to perform
the song on the piano.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.868
Yeah, I know, I know.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.004
I'm excited.
I've... never been more ready.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.540
(tongue clicks)
I love it, I love it.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.243
Uh, folks are starting to head
down for the wedding photos.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.211
So, getting myself together.

02:57.345 --> 03:00.381
I just can't wait
for your father to get here.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.052
-What's that?
-Uh, Randall.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.221
It's okay, it's just been
a little bit of a slow morning.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.923
Honey, you are looking amazing.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.892
We're on the homestretch now,
aren't we?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.861
Uh, don't forget, when, uh,
you're done with your hair,

03:13.961 --> 03:16.697
we're gonna head downstairs
to do pictures with Kate.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.198
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.
-MIGUEL: Okay? It's gonna
be a lot of fun.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.068
-REBECCA: Hmm.
-MIGUEL: Okay? So...

03:22.970 --> 03:25.439
Hey, uh, Randall?

03:25.539 --> 03:26.807
I-I wouldn't knock yourself out

03:26.907 --> 03:28.242
with all that medicine
right now.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.111
It's, uh,
it's constantly changing, so...

03:33.113 --> 03:35.549
I haven't seen that.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.051
I guess with the swearing in
and everything,

03:38.151 --> 03:39.420
I've missed some things.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.723
Yeah, well, it's, um,
it's been a rough month

03:42.823 --> 03:44.625
and the travel hasn't helped.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.060
But everybody's on board
with my plan to get

03:47.160 --> 03:49.096
the wedding photos knocked out
early so that she has

03:49.229 --> 03:52.733
a nice, long break to relax
before the ceremony.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.502
-(sighs)
-There is something
I'd like to ask you, though.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.936
Yeah.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.772
Are we sure about that part
on the side of your head?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.642
-You gonna mock me?
-I'm just...

04:01.742 --> 04:03.176
Because The New Yorker says
I'm a "rising star."

04:03.277 --> 04:04.912
So you should probably
address me accordingly.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.148
Oh, yes, Mr. Rising Star.
I'm sorry, uh, Senator Pearson.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.651
-Apologies, Senator Pearson.
-(laughs)

04:10.751 --> 04:12.286
You're a damn fool,
you know that?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.021
Yes. Look how handsome
you look, though.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.255
Is that government-issued
handsome?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.990
Just trying to keep up
with you, big guy.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.092
-Oh, I like that.
-(laughs)

04:19.192 --> 04:20.961
-RANDALL: I love you, Ma.
-I love you.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.162
All right,
see you guys down there.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.664
MIGUEL:
All right, see you there.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.467
*

04:26.567 --> 04:28.669
TOBY (over phone):
I want you to know

04:28.769 --> 04:30.938
that I see it now.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.643
-(knocking on door)
-Knock, knock.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.044
No, no, no. Really?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.347
You and Kevin have
serious boundary issues.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.114
Get out. You can't see Kate.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.116
Come on, Big Phil. No looky.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.887
Ladies, this is my second trip
down the aisle.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.722
And you know what
I learned the first time?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.191
That silly superstitions
have zero bearing

04:51.291 --> 04:52.860
on the outcome of marriages.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.128
So I'm gonna looky. Okay?

04:55.228 --> 04:57.398
I'm gonna looky real good.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.335
Fair enough.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.973
(exhales)

05:06.073 --> 05:07.508
Looky, looky.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.076
(phone chimes)

05:09.209 --> 05:12.513
Uhp, crap.
I have to dress the twins.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.881
BETH:
I'm gonna go with you.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.916
-See you downstairs.
-Goodbye.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.818
(door closes)

05:17.918 --> 05:19.019
Here we go.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.389
-Here we go.
-(chuckles)

05:21.522 --> 05:23.023
You don't mind me
sneaking a peek at you

05:23.156 --> 05:25.393
-before the day starts?
-Oh, hell no.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.695
I mean, I'm Zen Kate.
I'm Second Wedding Kate.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.363
I'm, like, the opposite
of a bridezilla.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.533
Like, I am cool with whatever
this wedding throws at me.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.201
-I'm cool.
-Mm.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.603
Sounds precisely like something

05:35.703 --> 05:38.672
someone who's overcompensating
would say.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.873
What's up?

05:39.973 --> 05:42.510
(exhales)

05:42.610 --> 05:44.412
Did you triple-- uh,
quadruple-check

05:44.545 --> 05:46.046
that the sheet music
is taped together?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.381
I don't want my mom
to rifle through

05:47.481 --> 05:48.549
while she's performing.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.718
-Yes.
-Okay.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.386
I quadruple-checked.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.287
All right? Listen,

05:54.388 --> 05:56.557
you've been working on this
with her for a year.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.225
She'll be fine.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.627
Philip, "fine" doesn't cut it.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.261
It doesn't cut it. This...

06:01.361 --> 06:03.964
This is a melody she's played us
since we were kids.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.634
This means a lot to her,
and if something goes wrong,

06:06.734 --> 06:09.870
-she's going to be
utterly devastated.
-Hey, listen to me.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.106
She'll be fine, okay?
Just breathe.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.975
(inhales sharply)

06:15.075 --> 06:17.377
-(exhales)
-She'll be fine.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.447
(quietly):
Yeah.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.950
Yes. She'll lock in
once she finds her key.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.752
There you go.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.255
Kevin couldn't have
dressed the twins

06:28.388 --> 06:30.290
-while we were getting ready?
-BETH: I'm gonna leave him

06:30.390 --> 06:31.592
a penis doodle as punishment.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.794
(laughs)

06:33.894 --> 06:36.229
Oh, hold up.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.632
What's this?
(gasps)

06:38.732 --> 06:42.436
"I would never leave you lost"
in female handwriting.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.171
Is this a love letter?

06:45.673 --> 06:49.009
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. Beth, look, a bra.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.514
Ooh, and it's right next to
some kind of floral wrap thingy.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.348
Kevin.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.651
It's like a frickin'
crime scene in here.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.653
Huh.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.356
-There's even makeup
in the bathroom.
-(gasps)

07:03.457 --> 07:05.659
(rapid footsteps)

07:05.759 --> 07:07.528
Oh, that's actually mine.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.697
Kevin borrows
my foundation sometimes.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.965
We have the same skin tone.

07:12.065 --> 07:16.136
Kevin is having a secret
wedding weekend romance,

07:16.236 --> 07:18.639
and these are the clues.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.509
It's like a true crime whodunit.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.010
But with sex.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.478
(camera clicks)

07:24.578 --> 07:28.348
Who do you think
he slept with last night?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.983
KEVIN:
That's really good.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.486
Uh, maybe we do, uh, just one
without all the wine glasses.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.522
Huh?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.323
Okay.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.692
Yep. Just like that.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.695
("Take Five"
by Dave Brubeck playing)

07:44.331 --> 07:45.332
(Madison gasps)

07:45.432 --> 07:47.535
-It could be the wedding singer.
-(gasps)

07:47.668 --> 07:50.137
-Philip's friend.
-She was at the rehearsal
last night.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.706
-Mm-hmm.
-And they were talking.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.141
You ain't slick, Kevin.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.544
-You ain't slick, Kev...
-No.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.478
-Don't do that.
-Hmm.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.013
(indistinct chatter)

08:00.113 --> 08:01.915
MADISON:
(gasps) Wait.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.084
Did you see that look
Sophie just gave him?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.887
Did I see it? I felt it.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.022
-They have crazy
history together.
-Mm-hmm.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.692
-Insane history.
-Mm-hmm.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.595
But wait. She's married.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.698
-Oh, yeah. That's not her M.O.
-No.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.768
Hello...

08:20.868 --> 08:22.402
BETH/MADISON:
Ooh.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.705
BETH:
Then there's Cassidy,
his plus-one.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.374
-MADISON: Right.
Just as a friend, though.
-BETH: Mm...

08:27.474 --> 08:30.611
He sizzles, she sizzles,
they're both single.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.112
Let's keep our options open.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.615
-(laughs) This is gonna be fun.
-Yeah, it will.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.517
-Oh, but hey, girl, hey,
I'm just checking in.
-Hmm?

08:37.618 --> 08:39.286
You sure you're cool
with figuring this out?

08:39.386 --> 08:41.054
I mean, you were gonna
marry the guy.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.289
You have seen his junk.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.858
Beth. It was a half decade ago.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.560
I have five-year-old twins
with the man

08:46.694 --> 08:49.730
and a nine-month-old
with my husband.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.565
-I need this.
-(chuckles)

08:51.699 --> 08:53.266
So let's find out who he banged.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.868
Let's get our
Agatha Christie on.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.971
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, Pearsons.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.773
Tuck in a little. Come on.

08:59.873 --> 09:00.808
Oh, you know what?
I was thinking,

09:00.908 --> 09:01.975
we got to be really careful

09:02.075 --> 09:03.443
who Senator Pearson
takes photos with.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
So, Elijah, bud? No offense,

09:05.646 --> 09:07.280
-but are we sure
you're not on any...
-Oh, boy.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.882
...you know, fugitive lists
or anything like that?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.318
You know, as designated
babysitter for the day,

09:11.418 --> 09:14.054
I just, I'm not gonna take
any crap from the Manny.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.322
-Ah.
-ALL: Ooh!

09:15.422 --> 09:16.456
All right, Senator Pearson,

09:16.556 --> 09:17.891
you better go get
your security detail.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.092
Elijah's getting aggressive.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.161
Uh, my daughters
are my detail, so I'm safe.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.664
Okay, you're trusting Annie
to stop a bullet?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.799
This is not
Kevin Costner-level security.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.167
She's really fast.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.302
Very funny, Jack.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.973
That's Kevin, Mom.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.475
Dad hasn't been with us
for a while, remember?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.145
-Uh, Randall...
-Why would you say that?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.014
-(shushes)
-No, no, no, no. S--

09:41.148 --> 09:43.350
-W-Why would you say that,
Randall? Seriously.
-I'm right here. I'm right here.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.284
-I'm right here. I'm right here.
-It's not true.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.786
It's okay, I'm right here.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.354
-I'm right here.
-I don't know
why he would say that.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.256
RANDALL:
Sorry. I'm sorry, Mom.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.128
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, let's burn one on three.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.632
One, two, three.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.467
(camera shutter clicking)

10:02.035 --> 10:03.370
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Great.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.505
*

10:13.847 --> 10:15.382
(Jack groans softly, exhales)

10:15.515 --> 10:17.217
Oh, wow. Look at these.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.819
Look at these. We...

10:18.919 --> 10:21.354
are gonna sell these
to help pay for college.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.056
(chuckles)
Hey.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.959
You know,
I can't remember the last time

10:26.059 --> 10:27.127
I saw you wearing a hat.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.029
Um...

10:29.129 --> 10:30.831
I may have done something...

10:30.931 --> 10:32.532
kind of stupid.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.469
Oh. Wow.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.839
Good wow or bad wow?

10:38.939 --> 10:41.174
It's different. It's different.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.210
I'm, uh... I'm-I'm...

10:43.343 --> 10:44.511
I'm getting my head

10:44.611 --> 10:45.713
-around it.
-Yeah?

10:45.846 --> 10:46.714
Yeah.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.816
KATE:
It's all right, Mom.

10:48.916 --> 10:49.917
Hair grows back.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.853
It's not all right.
I want old Mom back.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.254
KEVIN:
Argh!

10:54.354 --> 10:56.423
Walk the plank!

10:56.523 --> 10:58.692
Wh-What is this?
What is he-- what is he doing?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.028
He's playing Captain Hook.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.430
Because he thinks
I look like Peter Pan.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.199
(laughing)

11:06.299 --> 11:07.400
(chuckling)

11:07.534 --> 11:09.236
(laughing):
Oh, my God. He...

11:09.369 --> 11:12.372
Uh, not funny, pal!

11:12.472 --> 11:13.707
You look at me. Not funny.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.008
No. Give me this.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.210
All three of you,
dining table, right now.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.881
We are gonna talk about how
you speak to your mother.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.388
Okay, so that just happened.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.858
It's the new normal.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.625
I'm aware.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.694
-Still, it's...
-Yeah.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.696
She's been calling Kev "Jack"
on and off

11:36.797 --> 11:38.365
for the past couple days.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.532
Probably just triggered by,
you know,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.534
the shake-up in her routine,

11:41.634 --> 11:42.702
the wedding excitement.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.873
Doctor says
we're at the stage where...

11:45.973 --> 11:47.540
you shouldn't correct her.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.942
You know?
Just-just roll with it,

11:49.042 --> 11:50.744
you try to distract her
until the episode fades.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.712
Still.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.314
I know.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.154
Maybe Mom
shouldn't perform later.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.156
It's a lot of pressure.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.992
Yeah.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.294
Maybe it's too much.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.829
Mm.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.263
Uh...
(clears throat) Sorry.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.899
May I interject?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.433
Mm.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.970
Music is good for the soul.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.306
It's-it's been good
for her memory,

12:19.406 --> 12:21.942
and, the doctors,
they encourage her to do it.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.177
It's also why we have
the most...

12:24.311 --> 12:26.446
bizarre wedding schedule
of all time

12:26.546 --> 12:30.017
and why you'll be sitting
in your dress for 12 hours

12:30.150 --> 12:31.919
like a bridal mannequin.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.855
So that Rebecca gets
all the downtime she needs.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.458
Hey.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.260
Once she finds her key,

12:40.360 --> 12:41.995
she'll lock in.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.101
I'm gonna go check on her.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.003
Yeah, I will come with you,

12:50.103 --> 12:51.138
if you don't mind.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.641
Zen Kate.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.344
Your mother can
and will do this.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.647
I have no idea
if Rebecca can do this.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.683
I mean, th-this unfettered hope
that all will go well

13:03.817 --> 13:05.886
does not come naturally
to an Englishman.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.721
-Mm.
-I mean, I-I'm gonna try my best
to keep optimistic

13:08.856 --> 13:10.958
that it'll all be okay,
because it will...

13:11.058 --> 13:13.126
crush your sister if it doesn't.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.128
Tell me, um, in the event

13:15.228 --> 13:17.998
that she gets up on that stage
and starts to flounder,

13:18.098 --> 13:20.367
do you have
any senatorial powers

13:20.467 --> 13:22.369
to call a citywide blackout?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.536
I do not.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.472
Ah. Worth a try.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.340
(elevator dings)

13:27.440 --> 13:28.708
"You sip your drink,

13:28.842 --> 13:30.177
deepen your breath."

13:30.277 --> 13:32.679
Oh, who writes love letters
anymore?

13:32.779 --> 13:35.315
What, is Kevin's hookup
a World War II pilot?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.051
Wait, this totally has
the cadence of a poem.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.819
"With just one glance,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.688
I'd take my chance."

13:41.821 --> 13:43.523
-Yeah, a third grader's poem.
-(hisses)

13:43.656 --> 13:44.858
Yeah, it's not great.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.493
-Okay, then we have...
-(elevator dings)

13:46.593 --> 13:48.261
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Ooh.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.530
-Hey, Kev.
-Hey.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.731
-What's up?
-(hums)

13:51.865 --> 13:53.233
Well, you look fresh and ready.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.868
-Do I?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.369
Relaxing night or not so much?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.171
Well, it was, you know...

13:58.271 --> 13:59.606
Mm.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.442
Yeah, well... (inhales sharply)
I went to bed so early

14:02.542 --> 14:04.711
I feel like I missed out
on everything.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.547
Anything, uh,
interesting happen?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.182
(sighs)
You have no idea.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.550
I feel like I need a nap.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.886
-Huh.
-(elevator dings)

14:12.986 --> 14:14.254
Oh.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.722
-Hey, party people.
-Hey.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.257
You know,
this hotel has a sauna.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.292
That's, like, really swanky,
right?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.694
-Yeah, it is.
-So swanky.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.363
(quietly): Bet it gets
pretty hot and steamy in there.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.597
Mm-hmm.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.599
(whispering):
Oh. It's getting kind of chilly.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.368
Can I get my wrap
from your room?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.869
I think
I left it there last night.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.238
The, like, floral wrap thing.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.805
-KEVIN: Yeah. Course.
-Thanks.

14:33.941 --> 14:34.975
(elevator dings)

14:36.209 --> 14:37.877
(doors open)

14:42.482 --> 14:44.884
All right, now listen up.
There is no making fun

14:44.985 --> 14:46.553
of your mother.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.656
If you don't have something nice
to say about her new haircut,

14:49.756 --> 14:52.059
you don't say anything at all.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.594
What about you, Jack? You...

14:54.727 --> 14:57.230
haven't really said anything
about it since you saw it.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.066
I love it.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.268
You look great.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.835
Like a hotter Jamie Lee Curtis.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.972
But why did she cut it?

15:05.973 --> 15:08.341
Well, Randall, uh...

15:08.441 --> 15:09.943
I...

15:10.043 --> 15:13.013
I wanted to try something
more fashion-forward, okay?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.115
And I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.684
(exhales)

15:17.784 --> 15:18.685
(grunts)

15:18.785 --> 15:20.753
What's wrong with Mommy?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.122
She looks like He-Man--

15:22.222 --> 15:23.523
that's what's wrong with her.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.425
(chuckles softly)

15:25.525 --> 15:26.526
Not funny.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.696
-MIGUEL: All right.
-NICKY: Ah.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.099
-Uh-huh. Okay, okay.
-Look at that.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.666
And...

15:33.766 --> 15:35.302
-(Nicky chuckles)
-Mm-hmm.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.270
-Hello!
-(gasps)

15:37.370 --> 15:39.472
-Oh, come on. What is that?
-REBECCA: Oh!

15:39.572 --> 15:42.142
-Oh!
-MIGUEL: There is no way.
-Oh, yeah. Uh, what?

15:42.242 --> 15:43.176
-Where'd that come from?
-(chuckles)

15:43.276 --> 15:44.611
-What?
-Are you palming cards?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.013
NICKY:
Whoa! I'm a lover,

15:46.113 --> 15:48.815
Miguel, but those
are fighting words.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.683
-(laughs)
-I'm coming for you.
-RANDALL: Hey, Mom!

15:50.817 --> 15:52.652
-How you feeling?
-Look at that.
-Hi, sweetheart.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.622
Oh, good, good, good, if Nicky
here would just stop cheating.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.291
-Oh! Et tu, Rebecca?
-MIGUEL: Ooh.
-Honey,

15:58.391 --> 16:00.193
roll up your sleeves
so we aren't tempted to think

16:00.293 --> 16:02.029
-that you're hiding something.
-Hey, just--

16:02.162 --> 16:04.464
-Look, woman. Look at this.
-Oh, he's definitely
hiding something.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.199
-Right?
-(chuckling)

16:06.299 --> 16:08.535
Okay. Well, uh...

16:08.635 --> 16:11.238
Hey, should we talk about
that reception performance?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.140
Oh, no, I-I think we have, uh...

16:13.240 --> 16:14.874
We still have plenty of time
before the ceremony.

16:15.008 --> 16:18.045
And, clearly,
this game is over and tainted.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.181
-(sighs)
-Why don't we let Philip get
his mind right for the nuptials

16:21.281 --> 16:23.250
and you and I can go
and do our wine tasting

16:23.350 --> 16:24.351
that we've been talking about.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.685
That way,
we can replenish all the wine

16:25.785 --> 16:27.220
that Philip's family
drank up last night.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.022
(chuckles)

16:29.122 --> 16:30.857
Yeah, I don't know
if now's the right time

16:30.957 --> 16:33.026
-for a wine tasting, Miguel.
-Sure, it is.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.894
Come on. I insist.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.529
You go ahead, kiddo.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.897
You just leave me
with the ladies.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.333
We're gonna play
a new cheat-proof game.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.369
Yeah. Keep the optimism afloat.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.071
With a little merlot.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.039
Oh, no, if anybody orders
any merlot, I'm leaving.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.241
I am not drinking
any frickin' merlot!

16:49.876 --> 16:52.379
You see the-- Sideways.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.047
The movie. It was...

16:54.181 --> 16:56.516
Okay. You know what, let's go.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.352
-(birds chirping)
-(soft chatter)

17:01.754 --> 17:03.022
(swishing)
Mmm.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.558
-That is good.
-Mm.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.797
It's one thing to understand
these changes in Mom.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.932
It's another thing
to accept 'em.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.367
And accept
that even more are coming.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.770
Hey, should we, um,
try this older pinot next?

17:17.870 --> 17:20.207
-Mmm.
-All right. Let's go with that.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.875
Nice color.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.412
What if she starts to think
I'm William?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.615
Well, then let's toast

17:28.715 --> 17:30.617
-to your mother
not calling you William.
-(sighs)

17:30.717 --> 17:31.951
-Salud.
-Salud.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.257
Mmm.
(swishing)

17:37.390 --> 17:39.226
Oh, yeah. I'm getting, um,

17:39.326 --> 17:41.228
-notes of tobacco.
-Mm-hmm.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.629
Uh, is that cherry cola?

17:42.729 --> 17:43.930
-I think so.
-Yeah.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.498
-(sniffing)
-It's nice.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.633
Total Christmas notes.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.168
There's a toasty fireplace,

17:48.301 --> 17:49.469
a-a fresh-cut wreath.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.803
-It's...
-I mean, what if
this is the beginning

17:50.903 --> 17:52.839
-of an even bigger slide, man?
-(chuckles)

17:52.939 --> 17:54.341
-Okay, Randall, come on.
-Hmm.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.775
-I mean, seriously.
-What?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.513
I just thought
that we could both use a break

18:00.647 --> 18:02.515
from talking about Alzheimer's
today.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.684
-(takes deep breath)
-That is why we are here.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.018
-You're right.
-'Kay?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.654
You're right, sir.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.855
-I'll toast to that.
-All right.

18:08.955 --> 18:09.989
-Salud.
-Salud.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.695
Hey, Miguel,
I hate to say it. Um...

18:15.795 --> 18:16.863
but every time we toast, man,

18:16.963 --> 18:19.098
I've noticed a little
tremor there.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.001
-Come on, Randall. Just tell me
what you're tasting in...
-Back up in the room earlier,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.504
I saw some blood pressure meds
with your name on it.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.480
Why don't we jump
to the cabs next?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.849
I'm really excited
about tasting their big boys.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.351
Okay.

18:38.451 --> 18:42.355
Um, supposedly, this water here
is, uh, just amazing.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.624
Thank you,
you bed-hopping relic.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.493
(laughter)

18:48.127 --> 18:50.530
-(laughter)
-(chuckles): Okay.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.864
Edie's right, Nicky.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.533
You're definitely Sophia.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.734
Thank you.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.169
You mean the promiscuous one?

18:56.269 --> 18:58.004
No, the grumpy, old one.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.706
Oh, Christ, I'm taking fire

18:59.839 --> 19:01.374
-from all sides today.
-(chuckles)

19:01.508 --> 19:03.810
Definitely something
Sophia would say.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.913
Well, that would make
one of you broads the trollop.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.581
-Oh-ho.
-EDIE: Oh, hush up.
-(knocking)

19:08.715 --> 19:09.582
(gasps)

19:09.716 --> 19:11.083
Jack.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.019
Hey. There you are.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.654
Come. Sit.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.822
We're watching Golden Girls--

19:15.922 --> 19:18.658
the one where, uh,
Blanche pops the balloon.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.160
(chuckles)

19:21.261 --> 19:22.395
*

19:22.529 --> 19:24.731
SOPHIA:
First husbands, then cute shoes.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.566
What's wrong?

19:26.699 --> 19:27.567
Nothing.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.403
Um, nothing. I...

19:30.537 --> 19:31.871
I don't know. I just...

19:31.971 --> 19:34.507
had a rough night last night.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.544
Oh.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.413
Well, why don't we go take
a-a walk?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.215
You can tell me all about it.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.384
Yeah.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.052
You know, that'd be good.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.187
Mm. Okay.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.393
We won't be too long.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.898
(whispers):
You okay, kid?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.701
Yeah.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.536
Okay.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.738
-Shall we?
-Mm-hmm.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.540
(chuckles softly)

20:17.049 --> 20:18.651
Oh, babe.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.420
It looks good.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.788
Okay?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.590
It was just, uh...

20:23.723 --> 20:26.125
an unexpected jolt.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.960
-The kids hate it.
-(scoffs)

20:28.060 --> 20:30.263
Hey, if we're taking style tips

20:30.397 --> 20:32.565
from six-year-olds,
we're screwed.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.134
I hate it.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.137
Then why'd you cut it?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.408
(sighs)

20:41.508 --> 20:42.909
I'm-I'm...

20:43.009 --> 20:44.844
on autopilot, Jack.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.914
I can box the kids' lunches

20:48.014 --> 20:49.682
blindfolded.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.685
The guys at the deli
call me "Pound of Ham."

20:52.785 --> 20:54.854
They know I'm a mom--
I reek of mom.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.590
God, I-I don't want
to be Pound of Ham, Jack.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.526
Please tell me
I'm not just Pound of Ham.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.461
-Rebecca.
-(chair sliding)

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
You are not

21:04.464 --> 21:06.032
Pound of Ham.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.134
Okay?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.203
You want me to go down to the
deli? You-you want me to go down

21:11.338 --> 21:12.872
-and straighten
those idiots out?
-No,

21:12.972 --> 21:15.007
Jack, no, I-I...

21:16.443 --> 21:18.778
Sometimes I just
get tired of our routine.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.314
And...

21:21.414 --> 21:23.816
I want to feel spontaneous,

21:23.916 --> 21:26.018
like we used to.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.055
Come on, don't you ever
feel like this?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.290
Honestly, I...

21:33.893 --> 21:36.729
When I was a kid,
and we sit down at dinner,

21:36.863 --> 21:39.332
we didn't know if my dad
was gonna explode on us or not.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.001
If mom was gonna be crying.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.971
I mean, those two were
just a high-wire act.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.039
So...

21:47.139 --> 21:49.376
I don't know, I mean, I-I...

21:50.977 --> 21:53.480
I kind of find our routine

21:53.580 --> 21:55.582
to be a bit comforting.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.085
-So I'm awful.
-You're not awful.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.857
I don't want to lose myself
and forget who I am.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.028
I think I needed
to make a change

22:09.128 --> 22:11.230
to remind myself
that surprising things

22:11.364 --> 22:13.199
can still happen.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.510
Give me a minute.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.059
What's wrong, sweetie?

22:40.159 --> 22:41.461
Mom?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.796
Kev, talk to me.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.232
I missed you at the bonfire.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.034
Something happen last night?

22:48.134 --> 22:50.136
Um, well, you know, per usual,

22:50.236 --> 22:52.639
I find myself
in a bit of a pickle.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.707
I'm really struggling, you know?

22:54.807 --> 22:56.876
I feel like
I'm lost, romantically.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.581
You okay?

23:01.714 --> 23:02.882
-Mom?
-(scoffs)

23:02.982 --> 23:04.584
He'll figure things out.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.588
They just got married so young.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.890
High school first love.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.627
I think Kevin needs some...

23:14.727 --> 23:17.229
time to figure things out
with her.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.234
Yeah.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.673
(glasses clink)

23:26.773 --> 23:28.675
Wait, are we toasting
to Kevin and Cassidy?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.643
Or to our McNulty-level
detective work?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.645
Oh, definitely
our detective work.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.847
(chuckles)
Mm.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.015
Speak of the devil.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.618
-Hello.
-Hey!

23:38.718 --> 23:41.754
Oh, he's a good man.
Cassidy's a lucky girl.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.423
-Yeah.
-REBECCA: Oh, Sophie.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.192
We were just talking about you.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.360
No, we weren't...

23:48.495 --> 23:49.796
(clears his throat)

23:49.896 --> 23:51.330
Did you get any sleep?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.533
A little, yeah. You?

23:53.666 --> 23:56.268
KEVIN:
Yeah.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.505
We... We'll see you
at the wedding.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.807
Yeah.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.942
-Yeah.
-MADISON: Hmm.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.648
Okay, what the hell was that?

24:08.748 --> 24:10.149
Case un-closed.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.985
Did Kevin sleep
with Sophie and Cassidy?

24:13.085 --> 24:14.854
He is a terrible man.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.322
Just awful.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.190
-Trash.
-Mm.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.229
You'd think the one
Uber driver in this place

24:23.362 --> 24:25.532
would want a good review
and actually help out.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.002
Whoa! I got it, man.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.704
Okay.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.872
I see.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.340
What?

24:35.908 --> 24:37.977
You didn't need to snoop through
our pill bottles, Randall.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.846
I wasn't snooping through,
Miguel, I just stumbled

24:39.946 --> 24:41.714
upon it and I got concerned.

24:41.848 --> 24:44.050
Reasonably so, might I add.
I got it.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.686
No, I've got it. You don't think
I can handle a box, Randall?

24:48.420 --> 24:51.323
You know what I handle
on a daily basis?

24:51.423 --> 24:53.492
Hmm?

24:53.593 --> 24:56.095
I didn't need you calling out
my hand shaking.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.865
Which is a harmless response
to my medication,

24:58.965 --> 25:00.867
-which I am handling.
-Okay.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.869
Do you know what I needed?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.436
I needed an hour.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.773
To drink wine with someone.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.241
I needed just one minute to feel

25:09.375 --> 25:11.544
like a human being.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.446
I wanted to go with you.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.448
Because you drink wine.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.618
And you appreciate it,
like I do.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.622
I just needed a day, Randall.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.757
Because it is moving fast now.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.859
It is moving so fast
that I have whiplash.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.028
-What's moving fast?
-All of it.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.699
All of it.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.041
(car door closes)

25:48.047 --> 25:49.548
It's just you and me.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.918
It's not too late
to call this off, Skeletor.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.120
(lasers firing on TV)

25:54.220 --> 25:55.888
I think you just look like

25:55.988 --> 25:57.890
a really pretty boy, Mommy.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.592
(chuckles)

25:59.726 --> 26:01.761
Thank you, sweetheart,
thank you.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.330
SKELETOR:
Very clever, you muscle-bound...

26:04.430 --> 26:07.099
I did a thing.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.069
What did you do?

26:11.270 --> 26:13.472
You look like Magnum P.I.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.174
You look weird, Dad.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.843
I kind of like it.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.345
You know, I've always wondered

26:19.478 --> 26:21.313
if I can pull one of these off.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.949
I...

26:23.049 --> 26:25.451
am wondering the same thing.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.687
Well, a very wise woman
once told me

26:27.787 --> 26:29.455
it doesn't hurt
to shake things up

26:29.555 --> 26:31.190
from time to time.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.192
(chuckles softly)

26:33.292 --> 26:35.361
Hey, I called the sitter.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.964
What do you say we get
these new versions

26:38.064 --> 26:41.300
of ourselves dolled up
and take 'em out for a spin?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.435
Let the rug rats
eat the meatloaf.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.674
-On a Wednesday?
-On a Wednesday.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.711
(both laugh)

26:52.611 --> 26:54.180
I can't tell if you look like

26:54.280 --> 26:56.949
a pizza delivery man
or a porn star.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.818
Baby, tonight,

26:58.918 --> 27:00.352
I can be both.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.855
-Oh, okay.
-Mm-hmm.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.326
*

27:32.685 --> 27:35.354
*

27:55.942 --> 27:57.877
What can I say?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.747
I love you, Kate Pearson,
with every inch of my heart.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.448
which you single-handedly
defrosted

28:02.548 --> 28:04.450
and resuscitated
like an emergency room

28:04.550 --> 28:06.252
-physician...
-I think, uh...

28:06.385 --> 28:07.720
I think you might have my notes.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.421
Oh, dear.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.290
-(laughter)
-Ah, yes!

28:11.390 --> 28:13.225
This makes more sense.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.862
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for gathering today.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.396
We come together
to celebrate Kate and Philip...

28:17.529 --> 28:19.065
KATE:
Admit it.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.467
You hated me
the first time we met.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.537
And maybe I hated you
a little bit, too.

28:25.637 --> 28:28.207
So, no, this was not
a "love at first sight"

28:28.307 --> 28:30.476
magical fairytale romance.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.411
It was gritty.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.480
-Flaws up front.
-Mm-hmm.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.385
A Super Bowl ring only worthy

28:39.485 --> 28:41.220
of those willing to battle

28:41.320 --> 28:42.989
in the snow and in the mud.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.892
I'll explain
what a Super Bowl is later.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.493
(laughter)

28:47.593 --> 28:49.728
I give you this ring

28:49.829 --> 28:51.898
as a sign of my love.

28:52.899 --> 28:56.235
KATE:
And I give you this ring
as a sign of my love.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.638
OFFICIANT:
And there you have it.
You may now kiss the bride.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.176
(cheering, applause)

29:07.279 --> 29:09.015
Yeah!

29:16.522 --> 29:18.590
*

29:18.690 --> 29:21.693
* Now every pretty,
pretty girl *

29:21.794 --> 29:24.864
* Want to live in his mind
all the time *

29:24.964 --> 29:28.100
* He says I'm sitting
next to my girl *

29:28.200 --> 29:31.170
* On the dock of the bay. *

29:31.270 --> 29:33.705
(lisping heavily):
Marriage.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.676
Marriage is what brings us

29:37.776 --> 29:39.678
together today.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.881
Marriage,

29:42.014 --> 29:44.350
the blessed arrangement.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.785
That dream within a dream.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.454
Oh, good Lord.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.322
(laughs)

29:50.422 --> 29:51.824
Haud yer wheesht!

29:51.924 --> 29:54.526
You're quite the loud bunch,
aren't ya?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.029
Or maybe just off your trolleys.
Ah dinnae ken.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.697
(laughs)

29:58.797 --> 30:00.332
Right.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.368
Guess I should've
prepared something.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.703
(laughter)

30:04.837 --> 30:06.705
And that kills?

30:06.839 --> 30:08.307
And so, Philip,

30:08.407 --> 30:10.342
welcome to the family,
my brother.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.346
Sister.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.383
I love you beyond measure.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.351
WOMAN:
Aw.

30:19.451 --> 30:23.155
The two of you
have been very smiley today.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.192
-And I dig that.
-(people chuckling)

30:26.325 --> 30:29.561
-And, Philip,
yours is very nice,
-(mouthing)

30:29.695 --> 30:32.731
but my sister's...

30:33.765 --> 30:36.402
...my God, if it's not
the same infectious smile

30:36.535 --> 30:38.604
that she had
since we were little kids.

30:39.705 --> 30:42.708
And I'm so happy
that time hasn't changed that.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.445
And I'm really glad
that you broke it back out.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.050
(smacks lips)

30:51.918 --> 30:54.887
I've been thinking
a lot today, um...

30:54.987 --> 30:57.689
about time.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.425
And how, when you're young--

30:59.558 --> 31:01.627
like when you're Jackie's age--

31:01.727 --> 31:04.863
a year is like a fifth
of your existence.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.200
And so maybe
when you're younger,

31:08.300 --> 31:11.403
time seems to move
a little bit slower.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.908
Summer vacation is a lifetime.

31:16.943 --> 31:19.045
But the older we get,

31:19.145 --> 31:22.248
the faster time
just seems to come at us.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.450
All of us.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.653
You know, the years
just keep flying by,

31:27.753 --> 31:30.622
faster and faster.

31:32.158 --> 31:35.394
It can give a guy whiplash,
just thinking about it.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.068
And so while I would love
nothing more than to...

31:42.168 --> 31:45.237
stay in this moment
as long as humanly possible,

31:45.337 --> 31:48.174
to celebrate
our favorite newlyweds...

31:48.307 --> 31:50.776
sadly, I have yet
to build a remote

31:50.876 --> 31:53.512
that pauses life.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.082
-Damn.
-(laughter)

31:56.182 --> 31:58.284
That doesn't mean
there aren't still

31:58.384 --> 32:01.487
summer vacations to be enjoyed.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.823
Still good conversations
to be had.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.459
And still love to be shared.

32:09.128 --> 32:12.531
It just all happens much faster.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.168
But, um...

32:16.268 --> 32:18.204
in moments like this,

32:18.304 --> 32:20.872
when you're around
all your favorite people...

32:21.873 --> 32:25.444
...celebrating
a really special day...

32:26.512 --> 32:29.048
...time does slow down
ever so much.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.851
So I'm grateful to Kate

32:32.951 --> 32:35.187
and Philip for that.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.860
And I'm filled with comfort,
as I look around this room,

32:41.960 --> 32:44.363
knowing that all of you
will be on this

32:44.463 --> 32:46.999
speeding train with me,

32:47.099 --> 32:50.036
slowing down
for the occasional special stop.

32:50.169 --> 32:53.872
All the way till the very end.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.642
So, um...

32:56.742 --> 32:58.210
cheers.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.879
-MAN: Cheers.
-WOMAN: Cheers.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.382
(smacks lips)

33:03.515 --> 33:05.384
Okay.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.853
And now to drag us
back from the dark abyss

33:07.986 --> 33:09.688
that I just pushed us all into.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.524
(laughter)

33:12.658 --> 33:14.160
Uh, it is my pleasure
to introduce

33:14.260 --> 33:16.562
a very special performance.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.365
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen, I give you

33:19.498 --> 33:21.867
the one, the only...

33:21.967 --> 33:24.203
Mom.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.212
The stage is all yours, Mom.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.385
(whispering indistinctly)

33:58.570 --> 34:00.772
It took me a sec,
but I am turning

34:00.872 --> 34:03.041
positive on the mustache.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.077
-Women dig a 'stache.
-(laughs)

34:05.211 --> 34:06.778
And men...

34:06.878 --> 34:10.082
dig a woman who can pull off
a hot, short haircut.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.751
-Oh, thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.087
(chuckles)

34:16.755 --> 34:19.258
I think multiple men
calling me Pound of Ham

34:19.391 --> 34:21.393
really threw me.

34:22.728 --> 34:23.895
I love our routine.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.465
I know.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.601
Still good to shake things up
from time to time though.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.104
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.512
You know something
that Pound of Ham Rebecca

34:40.612 --> 34:42.414
-would never do?
-Hmm?

34:42.514 --> 34:45.117
Strut over to that piano over
there and rip it a new one.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.020
(laughs)

34:50.021 --> 34:51.323
Well...

34:51.423 --> 34:53.792
Pound of Ham Rebecca's dead.

34:53.892 --> 34:56.595
Oh, okay.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.797
(laughs)

35:01.133 --> 35:03.802
(crowd murmuring)

35:03.902 --> 35:06.172
I want you to know...

35:06.272 --> 35:08.540
that if your mother
is unable to perform,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.176
I've arranged for me
and the band

35:10.276 --> 35:12.178
to immediately start playing

35:12.278 --> 35:14.513
Celine Dion's
"My Heart Will Go On."

35:14.613 --> 35:16.182
(both laugh)

35:16.282 --> 35:18.817
-That's right, me on lead vocal.
-Mm-hmm.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.652
Going full Titanic.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.688
All right,
it's gonna be a catastrophe

35:22.788 --> 35:24.690
of such epic proportions
that no one's really gonna

35:24.823 --> 35:26.692
remember anything else
about this wedding.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.395
-I love you very much.
-Yeah.

35:29.528 --> 35:30.829
It's good to hear, you know?

35:30.929 --> 35:32.030
Considering.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.200
(both laugh)

35:45.577 --> 35:48.214
(playing off-key chords)

35:56.888 --> 35:59.024
(playing in-tune)

36:03.929 --> 36:07.233
* They say time will tell *

36:07.366 --> 36:09.401
* But I think it likes *

36:09.535 --> 36:12.671
* To keep secrets *

36:13.872 --> 36:17.209
* So we'll wait and see *

36:18.377 --> 36:21.046
* But it's just as well *

36:21.146 --> 36:23.715
* The years can be counted *

36:23.815 --> 36:27.185
* In seconds *

36:28.520 --> 36:32.123
* That's fine with me *

36:34.460 --> 36:37.696
* 'Cause I get this morning *

36:37.796 --> 36:39.965
* With you *

36:40.065 --> 36:43.602
* Forever now *

36:45.971 --> 36:48.073
* It all *

36:48.206 --> 36:51.109
* Hits me at once *

36:51.209 --> 36:54.613
* Forever now *

36:56.715 --> 37:00.552
* If there's a right way *

37:00.652 --> 37:03.054
* To say it *

37:03.154 --> 37:06.892
* I'm still learning how *

37:09.227 --> 37:12.564
* And maybe all that we have *

37:12.664 --> 37:17.603
* Is a forever now *

37:25.511 --> 37:27.579
(vocalizing)

37:33.519 --> 37:36.522
* I've been looking for words *

37:36.655 --> 37:39.458
* For feelings that shouldn't *

37:39.558 --> 37:42.994
* Get spoken *

37:44.029 --> 37:47.866
* It's something I do *

37:47.999 --> 37:50.869
* I'm starting to learn *

37:51.002 --> 37:54.172
* Some silences shouldn't be *

37:54.272 --> 37:57.476
* Broken *

37:57.576 --> 38:01.880
* Just listened to *

38:05.116 --> 38:08.387
* I get this moment *

38:08.520 --> 38:10.356
* With you *

38:10.489 --> 38:13.291
* Forever now *

38:15.961 --> 38:17.996
* It all *

38:18.096 --> 38:21.232
* Hits me at once *

38:21.367 --> 38:25.303
* Forever now *

38:27.038 --> 38:30.542
* If there's a right way *

38:30.642 --> 38:32.844
* To say it *

38:32.944 --> 38:36.848
* I'm still learning how *

38:39.585 --> 38:43.188
* All that we have *

38:43.321 --> 38:47.359
* Is a forever now. *

38:55.934 --> 38:58.003
(vocalizing)

39:02.708 --> 39:04.710
(stops playing)

39:07.746 --> 39:09.415
(applause)

39:09.548 --> 39:11.082
(cheering)

39:15.387 --> 39:17.589
You're still gonna make me
sing Celine, aren't you?

39:17.723 --> 39:19.725
-Yes.
-(both laugh)

39:21.092 --> 39:23.529
Listen, you really are a god
for tracking these kids all day.

39:23.629 --> 39:24.930
I wouldn't have been upset
with you if you'd lost, like,

39:25.030 --> 39:26.765
-one of them.
-ELIJAH: Yeah, well,
thanks, man.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.133
Just let me know
when my shift's over,

39:28.233 --> 39:30.068
so I can take all the edibles.

39:31.236 --> 39:32.904
(clears throat)

39:36.241 --> 39:38.143
What gives? You guys have been
looking at weird me all day.

39:38.243 --> 39:41.146
-Have we?
-Uh-huh.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.881
Have you been dishing
any weird looks?

39:42.981 --> 39:44.816
-Not I. Have you?
-No, no.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.718
-No weird looks over here.
-No clue what
you're talking about.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.587
Huh.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.558
Hey, um, can I steal you
for a second?

39:52.658 --> 39:54.325
Sure.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.161
Excuse me.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.666
Okay, so, um...

40:00.766 --> 40:02.568
about last night,
I am not usually...

40:02.668 --> 40:04.570
It's the wedding singer.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.171
We should've known
it was the wedding singer.

40:06.271 --> 40:08.173
It's always
the damn wedding singer.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.609
Always the wedding singer.

40:10.709 --> 40:14.145
* Well, my friends,
the time has come *

40:14.245 --> 40:18.450
* Raise the roof
and have some fun *

40:18.550 --> 40:21.152
* Throw away *

40:21.252 --> 40:23.321
* The work to be done *

40:23.421 --> 40:26.958
* Let the music play on,
play on, play on *

40:27.058 --> 40:31.763
* All night long, all night... *

40:31.863 --> 40:34.099
I loved your speech.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.802
It was equal parts sexy

40:36.902 --> 40:39.104
-and depressing.
-Well, that's my sweet spot.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.940
-So, yes.
-(giggles)

40:42.040 --> 40:44.676
-* All night long, oh, yeah *
-* All night *

40:44.776 --> 40:46.211
* All night... *

40:46.344 --> 40:48.213
Mom is sick.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.881
* People dancing
all in the street *

40:50.015 --> 40:52.017
Miguel's getting old.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.020
* See the rhythm
all in their feet... *

40:55.120 --> 40:57.856
I can see
where it's all heading now.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.860
And it's all headed there
so fast.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.563
* All night long... *

41:04.696 --> 41:07.198
What are you supposed
to do with that?

41:07.332 --> 41:10.035
Only thing you can do, baby.

41:11.402 --> 41:14.039
You dance.

41:14.172 --> 41:17.543
* Everyone you meet,
dancing in the street *

41:17.643 --> 41:20.045
-* All night long *
-* All night *

41:20.145 --> 41:23.815
* Oh, yes, all night long *

41:25.350 --> 41:27.485
* All night long *

41:27.586 --> 41:29.655
* All night, all night... *

41:29.755 --> 41:31.489
-Yo.
-Hey.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.525
So, for real, bro.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.661
What happened with you
last night?

41:35.761 --> 41:38.029
Aw, man, it's a long story.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.831
Is it a good story?

41:39.931 --> 41:42.267
-* All night *
-* All night *

41:42.367 --> 41:45.403
-* All night, all night *
-* All night *

41:45.537 --> 41:49.908
-* All night, all night *
-* All night, all night long *

41:50.041 --> 41:51.577
* All night, all night... *

41:51.710 --> 41:53.712
-I don't know yet.
-* All night long. *

42:00.586 --> 42:03.221
* They say time will tell *

42:03.354 --> 42:05.691
* But I think it likes *

42:05.791 --> 42:09.527
* To keep secrets *

42:09.628 --> 42:13.198
* So we'll wait and see *

42:13.298 --> 42:16.234
* But it's just as well *

42:16.367 --> 42:19.204
* The years can be counted *

42:19.304 --> 42:22.574
* In seconds *

42:22.708 --> 42:25.043
* And that's fine with me. *
