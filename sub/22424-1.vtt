- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.848
- How's your day?

01:20.881 --> 01:22.583
- Interesting.
- Ha.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.486
- Where's Homicide?

01:25.519 --> 01:26.787
- They're dragging ass as usual.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.556
So, here's what we got:

01:28.589 --> 01:30.191
Santa Claus there
is your trigger man,

01:30.224 --> 01:32.193
his real name is
Randall Edwards.

01:32.226 --> 01:35.496
The clerk is, was Heather
Harrington, she's DOA.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.732
Ambulance is in route, there's
no sign of the money yet

01:38.766 --> 01:41.202
and this one was a silent alarm.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.237
- Just another
Christmas Eve, huh?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.573
- Oh, yeah, and get this, Santa
Claus says he didn't do it.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.408
- Of course he
didn't, how could he?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.576
He's out delivering
all those toys, right?

01:48.609 --> 01:49.843
- Huh, joker.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.379
- Hey, you want a candy cane?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.613
- No, man.
- Ah, come on.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.182
- No, no, no.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.920
- I'm going in.
- How's Julia?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.855
- Oh, she loves Christmas.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.791
- At least somebody does.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.227
- What the hell are you
doing in my crime scene?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.494
Shouldn't you be on the street

02:40.528 --> 02:42.496
controlling the crowds, officer?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.232
- Am I in uniform?

02:44.265 --> 02:46.300
- Yeah, congratulations,
now step off.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.336
Last thing I need
is a DA up my ass

02:48.369 --> 02:51.905
'cause some dumb shit
trampled my scene, let's go.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.641
- Pardon me, Serpico.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.908
- What was that?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.644
- Nothing.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.279
- Yeah,
that's what I thought.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.783
- It's Heather Harrington.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.652
- What?

03:04.685 --> 03:07.421
- Her name, just thought
you might wanna know.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.656
My mistake.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.358
- Get him the hell outta here.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.825
- 'Cause, see, I
would wanna know.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.561
Because tomorrow
somebody who knows her

03:13.594 --> 03:15.596
is gonna have a very
unmerry Christmas.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.797
- You done?
- Yeah, he's done.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.566
He's done, come on.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.468
- How do you just waltz
in these crime scenes?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.870
You see a young girl murdered,
you don't feel a thing?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.638
Is that part of the
job description?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.307
The application say,
homicide detectives,

03:26.340 --> 03:28.342
all must be
diagnosed sociopaths?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.856
- Control, six Lincoln
20, code seven.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.758
- Roger 20,
code seven approved.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.595
Bring back something
tasty, okay, honey?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.397
- Don't I always, Julia?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.498
20 out.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.376
Heads, I'll do it.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.285
Best two out of three.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.790
- Merry Christmas.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.025
That's for the children.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.365
- Merry Christmas.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.299
And happy new year.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.013
- Ugh!
- Whoa, whoa.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.482
- Goddamn!
- You hurt?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.417
You'll be all right.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.751
Take it easy next time.

05:17.785 --> 05:21.021
- There won't be a next time.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.390
- You're too young for makeup.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.392
- No, I know.

05:24.425 --> 05:28.496
But I also saw this dog at
the pet store and I want it.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.033
- Evening.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.502
What can I get for you?

05:38.105 --> 05:39.507
Christopher.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.042
- Hey, Mom.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.944
- What are you doing here?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.548
- I just happened to
be in the neighborhood,

05:47.581 --> 05:49.483
thought I would stop by.

05:50.784 --> 05:56.857
- Ah, hmm, just happened today?

05:56.890 --> 05:59.126
- I know, what are the odds?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.394
- Remote.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.397
- Probably.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.036
- So, how are things with you?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.074
- Never better.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.079
- Last thing I pegged
you being was a cop.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.049
- Hmm, yeah,
it makes two of us.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.752
It's detective now.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.455
- Ah, detective.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.123
Well, I guess you didn't
stop by for the conversation,

06:30.157 --> 06:31.892
did you?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.894
- It's actually my dinner break,

06:33.927 --> 06:37.931
so I thought I would kill
two birds with one stone.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.066
- Same old?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.701
- Mm-hmm, times two.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.872
- I think your eyes are
bigger than your stomach.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.840
- Second one is not for me.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.811
- A girl?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.649
Are you?

06:55.683 --> 06:56.917
- Yeah.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.720
- Mmm.

07:01.522 --> 07:05.693
- In fact, I might
propose to her.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.528
Maybe even tonight.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.830
- Hmm, Christmas present.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.866
- Something like that.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.168
- Is that why you
stopped by, to tell me?

07:17.538 --> 07:18.606
- No.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.943
So, how's work?

07:24.812 --> 07:27.080
- Never changes.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.717
I had a couple of chuds
in here earlier, yeah,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.752
same old kinda night.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.856
- You don't get a lot of
customers on Christmas Eve, huh?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.224
- No.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.626
Not really.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.162
- How are you holding up, Mom?

07:42.195 --> 07:43.531
- I'm good.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.600
Everything is fine.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.101
- Saw those when I walked in.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.603
- What?

07:51.605 --> 07:52.673
Ah, yeah.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.876
- Started smoking again, huh?

07:55.909 --> 07:58.111
- Yeah, a few years ago.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.813
- You said you'd quit.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.649
- Couple of times.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.751
- Didn't take, huh?

08:03.784 --> 08:07.087
- Didn't feel the
need after you left.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.857
I only quit for you.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.960
- I don't understand why you
would start up smoking again.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.895
Especially after
what happened to Dad.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.063
- Okay, now you don't
talk about things

08:16.096 --> 08:18.866
you know nothing about.

08:30.744 --> 08:36.116
- Is that the same tree?

08:36.149 --> 08:38.085
First grade, right?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.821
Wow.
- Yeah.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.093
Been a long time since I had
a real Christmas tree in here.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.728
- It's festive.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.064
- Mom, when is Daddy coming?

08:51.098 --> 08:54.034
- He's coming, baby, you
gotta be patient, okay?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.135
- Okay.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.271
- Okay, Chris.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.073
Let's be honest.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.277
What are you really doing here?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.148
- I just wanted to say,

09:10.183 --> 09:12.152
Merry Christmas, Mom.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.190
- Well, thank you.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.928
Merry Christmas to you too.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.063
- Thank you.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.766
I gotta hit the road.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.101
- Oh, wait, what
about your food?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.770
- She'll understand.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.705
- Oh, well, um.

09:31.739 --> 09:35.676
In that case, it was
really nice seeing you.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.348
Unless there's
something you wanna say.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.152
- Like what?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.321
- Not for me to say.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.124
- Is this about Dad?

09:51.158 --> 09:54.161
'Cause I'm not in
the mood for games.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.963
You want something from me?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.666
- Oh, no, there's
nothing I want from you.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.767
Nothing.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.770
- Okay, so, that's it.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.938
If there's something
on your mind,

10:04.972 --> 10:07.240
now's the time to say it.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.981
- You didn't even ask about him.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.086
- I didn't need to, Mom.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.190
When the door opened and I
saw you and not him, I knew.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.894
- You know, before the funeral,
I sent you that letter.

10:26.927 --> 10:31.799
He wanted to see you just one
last time before he passed.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.801
- I didn't read it.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.004
- Did you even open it?

10:38.739 --> 10:39.973
- Thought about it.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.277
- That's just so typical.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.747
You just can't be wrong.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.758
- That's what you want.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.693
You just want me to say
that I was wrong and--

10:59.727 --> 11:04.064
- No, how about we just
start off with I'm sorry?

11:07.134 --> 11:10.938
You can't say those
two little words.

11:10.971 --> 11:15.843
Nope, because you're
just, you're too damn,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.145
you're too damn stubborn.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.848
- No, I'm not.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.049
- Not what?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.953
Not stubborn or not wrong?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.921
- Pick one, I gotta go to work.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.957
- Okay, Chris, don't.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.226
Please don't leave,
we can fix this.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.100
Just, you just have to try.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.138
- Just because you won't let
me forget what I did wrong

11:45.172 --> 11:47.374
doesn't mean that I
don't spend every day

11:47.407 --> 11:49.910
wishing I could change it.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.479
But I can't go back
in the past, Mom.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.014
And I've come to accept that.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.182
Why can't you?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.763
- No, Chris, wait!

12:09.797 --> 12:10.831
- Gee.

12:15.869 --> 12:19.139
Control, six Lincoln 20,
code seven over, over?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.240
- Roger, 20.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.474
Are you okay, Chris?

12:21.508 --> 12:24.011
- Negative, Control, 20 out.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.448
Why couldn't I just
say, I'm sorry?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.085
I'm sorry.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.186
See?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.287
I'm sorry.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.131
Jesus!

12:46.466 --> 12:48.235
- Christopher!

13:43.924 --> 13:46.159
- Turn the vehicle off, please.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.227
- Yes, sir.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.098
Well, I guess I was wrong.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.968
The diner.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.170
I said there wasn't
gonna be a next time.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.139
- You know how fast
you were going?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.607
- Uh, no.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.542
- You could have
killed somebody.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.146
Something funny?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.414
- No, sir.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.227
- What's the deal with those?

14:21.995 --> 14:25.565
- Those, just some
side work I do.

14:25.598 --> 14:29.169
Irrigation, stuff like that.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.172
- License and registration.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.340
- Sure thing.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.413
- What was that?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.182
- I don't know.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.917
- Pop the trunk.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.386
Now!
- Yes, sir.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.558
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.438
- Yeah, that's how my son was,

15:05.472 --> 15:07.474
really disrespectful
and stubborn,

15:07.507 --> 15:10.610
always wanting someone
at his beck and call.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.982
- You're talking about
him in the past tense.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.550
- Yeah, I haven't
talked to him in years.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.153
That's just how it is.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.688
- Sorry about that.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.994
- Evening, sir.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.262
Take a seat anywhere,
I'll be in in a second.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.174
- Hey.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.242
- Hey.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.182
So, get any good shots?

15:49.216 --> 15:51.084
- Couple.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.186
- They gonna
make you rich and famous?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.687
- I doubt I'll be
as famous as Avedon

15:54.721 --> 15:57.324
but it's an interesting hobby.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.694
- So you're just gonna be one
of those starving artists?

16:01.728 --> 16:03.363
- Are we starving?

16:03.396 --> 16:06.199
- No, no thanks to you.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.534
- What's that mean?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.302
- I hate to break it to you

16:09.336 --> 16:13.206
but your trust ain't
gonna last forever.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.575
- You know, you're one
of a handful of people

16:15.608 --> 16:19.212
who believes that seven
figures won't last a lifetime.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.214
- At the rate you spend it?

16:21.248 --> 16:22.315
- On you.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.451
- Oh.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.519
You're regretting it yet?

16:26.553 --> 16:29.056
- Course not, I love you.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.293
- Sasha Harrington Carlisle.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.263
Geez.

16:36.296 --> 16:40.200
I sound like I was born with
a silver spoon up my ass.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.270
- We talked about
this, no hyphens.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.704
- Uh, yeah, hyphens.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.207
Consider yourself lucky.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.775
I was gonna keep my last name.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.410
Taking the groom's name?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.379
It's too fucking patriarchal.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.183
- You don't want my name?

16:56.216 --> 16:57.750
- In Korea,

16:57.784 --> 16:59.552
wives don't take their
husbands' last name.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.321
- I didn't know we lived
in Korea, which Korea?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.022
- The good one.

17:05.224 --> 17:11.198
So, my David, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.099
- Yeah.

17:13.133 --> 17:17.069
- This brooding photographer
shit is for the birds.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.339
When are you gonna
get a real job?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.374
- A real job.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.276
Refresh my memory.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.248
- I know this is a very
foreign concept to you,

17:28.281 --> 17:31.218
but most people tend
to leave their house

17:31.251 --> 17:34.221
for eight hours a
day, five days a week,

17:34.254 --> 17:38.225
and they go to this magical,
faraway land called work.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.759
And they make money.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.529
- Is that so?

17:42.562 --> 17:43.663
Maybe I got left out
of the loop, huh?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.665
- David, I'm serious.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.834
You hanging around the house
all day is kinda fucked up

17:47.867 --> 17:49.802
when I have to go and work.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.504
- What's bothering you more?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.173
That you're working
or that I'm not?

17:53.206 --> 17:54.307
- Both.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.542
- You wanna switch?

17:55.575 --> 17:56.843
- No, I just wanna be equal.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.345
* Fa la la la la, la la la la

17:58.378 --> 18:00.813
* Tis the season to be jolly

18:00.847 --> 18:03.850
* Fa la la la la, la la la la

18:03.883 --> 18:06.819
* Don we now our gay apparel

18:28.941 --> 18:31.311
David, are you listening to me?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.213
David.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.747
- Not really.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.349
- Hi, I'm sorry for the delay.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.285
I hope I didn't
keep you too long.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.254
There you go, it's on the
house, Merry Christmas.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.622
- Appreciate it.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.257
- Oh, well, thank you.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.227
Would you like
some food, dessert?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.628
- I think we'll need
a minute or two.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.697
- Oh, okay, just let me know.

18:50.730 --> 18:55.268
* Join the triumph of the skies

18:55.302 --> 18:59.206
* With angelic host proclaim

18:59.239 --> 19:03.410
* Christ is born in Bethlehem

19:03.443 --> 19:07.814
* Hark, the herald angels sing

19:07.847 --> 19:11.718
* Glory to the newborn King

19:14.487 --> 19:16.256
- Good stuff, ladies.
- All right.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.390
- So, hot chocolate?

19:17.424 --> 19:18.758
- Yes, sounds good.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.660
- All right, let's
get a move on.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.601
I caught you trying to
sneak a peek earlier.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.838
Now, what would Mrs. Claus
have to say about that?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.707
- Well, she is the
jealous type, so--

19:34.741 --> 19:36.543
- Got you by the balls?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.245
- Ice grip.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.312
- Ugh!

19:40.980 --> 19:42.415
- So, all this?

19:42.449 --> 19:44.284
Why do you do it?

19:45.252 --> 19:46.753
- For the kids.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.256
- You have kids?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.823
- A charity.

19:50.857 --> 19:55.228
It's just a small
way that I give back.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.264
On the streets, kids don't
have much to look forward to

19:57.297 --> 19:58.931
this time of year.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.535
I'm Lena.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.670
- Jason.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.638
- Pleasure.

20:07.006 --> 20:11.878
- So, got any plans
for Christmas?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.447
Maybe besides this, obviously.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.549
- Very little.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.852
I'm a full blown Heeb.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.923
- Yeah, I'm not really a
big man upstairs kinda guy.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.259
- Just because I'm
into the Tanakh

20:26.293 --> 20:29.696
doesn't mean I can't give you
New Testament boy some love.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.333
- So.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.438
You doing anything after?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.644
- Just him.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.978
- Ha.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.616
- It was nice to
meet you, Jason.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.752
And good luck with
the collection.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.661
- David.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.063
David, I'm not fucking
around, please.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.064
- Debatable.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.766
- Bullshit.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.067
You treat me like
your fucking pet.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.802
While I'm at work,

21:09.836 --> 21:11.704
you hang around on the
sofa watching movies

21:11.738 --> 21:13.540
or doing whatever the
fuck you do on that couch.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.908
- I read, too, sometimes.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.645
Besides, how would you know?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.413
If you're at work?

21:20.447 --> 21:21.481
- Because you're always
still watching them

21:21.514 --> 21:22.982
when I come back.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.784
- Oh, really?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.753
You're really tugging at
the heartstrings here.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.920
I mean, those starving kids
in Africa got nothing on you.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.322
- That's not fair.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.058
- Life is not fair.

21:34.026 --> 21:37.630
I pay for the house, I pay
for my car, paid off your car.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.433
The one you
handpicked, by the way.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.336
Got you that rock you love
to flaunt so fucking much.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.805
And all your jewelry,
and your spa treatments,

21:45.838 --> 21:47.507
whatever the hell they are.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.610
And in return,
you pay the groceries.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.078
Which I cook.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.380
And the utilities.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.914
Is that so tough?

21:54.947 --> 21:56.916
Because if it is,
you're free to walk.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.084
And with your propensity for
being the village bicycle

21:58.117 --> 21:59.986
back in the day,

22:00.019 --> 22:01.621
you should have no trouble
hooking up somewhere.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.425
So don't pretend
you're Mother Teresa

22:05.458 --> 22:06.893
and you don't give
a damn about money,

22:06.926 --> 22:09.462
because I know you, Sasha.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.100
And despite your
contempt for me,

22:14.133 --> 22:16.569
I would prefer you
stay because I love you

22:16.603 --> 22:19.572
regardless how
you feel about me.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.642
- You sure know how to show it.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.848
- Don't you think

22:28.881 --> 22:32.619
I wish you loved me the
same way I loved you.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.387
- Meaning what?

22:34.421 --> 22:35.955
- Let's just say you
love your low cut tops

22:35.988 --> 22:37.757
and you're getting
dolled up all the time

22:37.790 --> 22:39.826
but you're not doing it for me.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.862
- So you think I'm screwing
other guys behind your back?

22:42.895 --> 22:47.400
- I just think that you
like looking your best

22:47.434 --> 22:52.138
and I look like a waste of time.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.140
- In a T-shirt.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.142
- It's a heat wave.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.914
You wanna get outta here?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.533
You're always doing that.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.901
- Why didn't you
park in the lot?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.135
- 'Cause I couldn't find a spot.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.938
- You and your old man car.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.107
- Let's not start that again.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.076
- And it looks really bad
when you park on the driveway,

23:30.109 --> 23:32.011
you know?
- What, next to your Lexus?

23:32.044 --> 23:33.079
- It's a Mercedes.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.484
- I'm gonna pretend I
didn't blatantly hear you

23:37.517 --> 23:39.085
dissing my car.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.921
- Would I do that?

23:41.954 --> 23:43.890
- Wait, wait, I've
got a present for you.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.658
- Okay, thank you.
- It's in the trunk.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.959
- Can we go?

23:46.993 --> 23:48.194
Please.
- It's in the trunk.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.096
- Come on, David, I'm sweating.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.798
- Let's open it here.
- I'm gonna get cholera!

23:51.831 --> 23:54.100
Standing in this
Christmas heat wave.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.102
- Christmas heat wave.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.972
You don't get cholera from
heat, you get it from bad water.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.842
- Okay, I will open it, okay?

24:06.846 --> 24:10.917
- You know, I think it's
some of my best work.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.093
- When did you take those?
- I took them last night.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.161
Isn't that something?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.030
Santa came early.

24:24.063 --> 24:28.167
Here, I thought you
weren't the intimate type

24:31.771 --> 24:34.106
Is this one of those
it's-not-me-it's-you things

24:34.140 --> 24:37.844
or it's-not-you-it's-me things,
whatever the fuck it is?

24:37.877 --> 24:39.111
- How could you do that?
- How could I?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.513
How could I?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.114
I'm so glad you asked me that.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.617
I mean, while you were
kissing him in the dark,

24:44.651 --> 24:47.019
I had to open the
aperture to an f-3.5.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.621
The ISO was a bitch.
- David.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.557
- But I got there--
- David, stop!

24:50.590 --> 24:54.661
- When I told you I loved
you, it wasn't bullshit.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.162
But you never loved me, did you?

24:56.195 --> 24:58.798
Did you?
- Of course I did.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.534
- Past tense.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.936
- I still do.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.906
- Get your hands off me.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.676
I don't know what hurts more.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.913
You lying with a straight face

25:13.946 --> 25:17.083
or me wishing I
could believe you.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.123
- Sorry, babe.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.191
So sorry.

25:27.159 --> 25:31.530
I've been meaning to do
this for a long time.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.267
- You wanna kill me?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.136
You wanna kill me?

25:37.169 --> 25:38.605
You wanna kill me?

25:38.638 --> 25:40.139
Okay, let's go.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.092
- She's done for, buddy.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.332
Snap out of it,
we got work to do.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.235
First things first, okay?

26:09.268 --> 26:12.138
You can't stay out here
in this heat like this.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.806
You're gonna need a fucking IV

26:13.840 --> 26:16.609
to replace all the
fluids you lost.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.115
Where you going?

26:23.149 --> 26:26.686
All right, it's
cool, man, no hurry.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.957
I'll stay here and keep watch.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.232
- Lose something?

26:42.201 --> 26:43.269
- Oh.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.205
- Geez, what happened?

26:47.406 --> 26:50.409
- Oh, I didn't know, I tripped.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.211
- Tripped on what?

26:53.980 --> 26:57.149
- Oh, it's kinda stupid, really.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.818
Thanks.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.419
- Yeah, sure.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.188
Merry Christmas.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.925
- Ugh!
- Whoa, whoa.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.159
- Goddamn!
- You hurt?

27:07.193 --> 27:09.128
You'll be all right.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.396
Take it easy next time.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.232
- There won't be a next time.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.073
- Camera's not
the hope diamond, buddy.

27:21.107 --> 27:24.143
You can always buy a new one.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.946
- If I had left it there, it
would have been suspicious.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.416
- Well, body-checking a cop
is pretty suspicious too.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.218
Don't you think?

27:35.822 --> 27:37.323
I don't think Sleeping Beauty

27:37.356 --> 27:40.226
is gonna wake up
from that one, mm-mm.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.728
- Shut the fuck up.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.195
- Oh, testy, huh?

27:44.864 --> 27:47.033
That's what I love
about you, Davy.

27:47.066 --> 27:51.303
You hit all the stages,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.272
One after the other.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.146
What, huh?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.380
You should be happy.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.216
Acceptance is the final stage.

28:06.518 --> 28:10.156
- No more fucking
chat, shut the fuck up!

28:10.189 --> 28:12.992
- Why you getting
all riled up, huh?

28:13.025 --> 28:16.328
I mean, you should
be grateful, dick.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.767
- Oh, fuck.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.207
- We better get her out of here.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.213
She looks so peaceful,
don't you think?

28:38.184 --> 28:41.253
All right, let's roll.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.968
I bet you 20 bucks
I find it first.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.536
- I don't
even own a shovel.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.271
- Of course you do.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.372
It's one of those
things everyone has

29:00.406 --> 29:02.975
stashed away somewhere.

29:03.009 --> 29:07.379
Aha, and I'm the type of guy
who's gonna say, I told you so.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.452
- Let's go.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.421
- Hold on a second.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.522
Oh, yeah.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.429
Yeah, it's nice.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.164
- Are you fucking crazy?

29:25.197 --> 29:27.834
- Ha, hardly.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.202
- I'm not
chopping her up.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.938
- So, look.

29:31.971 --> 29:35.141
We go out there, dig a
hole, we'll put her in.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.110
- Right.

29:38.144 --> 29:43.182
- Then, we'll cut her
into teeny, tiny pieces.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.851
- I'm not doing
that, I told you,

29:44.884 --> 29:47.186
I'm not cutting
her up, all right?

29:47.219 --> 29:49.155
Jesus!

29:49.188 --> 29:50.422
- See, this is why I hate
hanging out with you, Dave.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.892
You never wanna have no fun.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.927
- Being psychotic is fun to you.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.996
- Well, here's what's psychotic.

29:57.029 --> 30:02.001
You fucking sitting around
all day watching action movies

30:02.034 --> 30:05.271
and never doing
anything with your life.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.438
- I'm happy.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.240
- Look at you lying.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.611
Nobody could be happy
doing what you do.

30:12.644 --> 30:18.017
- I suppose all things
considered, it's not too bad.

30:18.050 --> 30:22.254
- What would you do if Mommy
and Daddy were still alive

30:24.090 --> 30:28.060
and you didn't have this
nice little nest egg?

30:28.094 --> 30:31.197
You'd be doing the same
fucking thing you're doing now.

30:31.230 --> 30:34.066
Nothing, nada, ha.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.305
- I can't believe
she did that to me.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.173
Oh, you knew.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.418
- What does he
have that I don't?

30:52.451 --> 30:56.288
- Sense humor, massive cock.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.525
Sounds like me, don't you think?

30:59.558 --> 31:01.593
- Shut the fuck up.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.196
- You better slow down.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.199
You're driving a little
too fucking fast.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.434
- I'm not.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.535
- You're driving too fast, okay?

31:11.370 --> 31:15.207
See, I told you you
were driving too fast.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.009
- Fuck.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.644
- I can't fucking believe you.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.379
- You're distracting me.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.181
- Oh my god.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.050
- Shut the fuck up.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.151
- Oh, geez.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.467
Just be cool, man.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.435
We're not going to jail.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.372
- We are if he find
that fucking body.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.474
- I'm not going to jail,

31:48.507 --> 31:52.411
hence, we're not
going to jail, get it?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.213
- Don't do anything.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.447
- Oh, trust me.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.650
Hey, you want me to handle this?

31:58.684 --> 32:02.154
'Cause I can play nice.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.223
- I think you've done
enough for one night.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.958
I don't want you
screwing this up.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.227
- Screwing what up, huh?

32:10.596 --> 32:11.697
- Shut up.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.035
- You shut up.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.342
- Turn the
vehicle off, please.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.510
- Yes, sir.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.579
I guess I was wrong.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.381
The diner.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.483
I said there wasn't
gonna be a next time.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.252
- You know how
fast you were going?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.021
- No.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.688
- You could
have killed someone.

32:36.722 --> 32:40.226
- Slow your roll,
Mr. Police Officer.

32:40.259 --> 32:44.196
Close only counts in horseshoes,
grenades, and nuclear war.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.666
- Something funny?

32:49.035 --> 32:49.935
- No, sir.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.672
- You ran a red
light while speeding

32:53.705 --> 32:56.275
in an urban center, and
you're laughing about it.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.244
- I'm not.

32:58.277 --> 33:01.313
I wasn't paying attention,
I'm really, really sorry.

33:01.347 --> 33:04.083
- Don't apologize to this prick.

33:04.116 --> 33:07.986
Take him out so we can
get back to business.

33:11.157 --> 33:14.426
- What do
you do with those?

33:14.460 --> 33:17.729
- Those, just some
side work I do.

33:17.763 --> 33:21.033
Irrigation, stuff like that.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.701
- License
and registration.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.237
- Oh, this must be serious.

33:25.271 --> 33:28.674
Officer of the law,
emotion forbidden.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.480
- What's that?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.715
- I don't know.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.684
- Pop the trunk, now.

33:41.087 --> 33:44.556
- You should take him
out for your own good.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.261
Take him out.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.662
Take him out.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.264
You heard him.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.302
- Now!

34:08.880 --> 34:10.416
- Now's not the time to ponder

34:10.449 --> 34:13.319
your shitty life choices, okay?

34:15.286 --> 34:17.289
All right, let's go.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.393
- I'm sorry.

34:28.766 --> 34:32.271
This is not working
out, you, me, us.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.710
- Breaking up with me, Davy?
- I'm serious.

34:38.744 --> 34:43.849
Every time I listen to
you, things turn to shit.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.284
- Well, whose fault is that?

34:46.318 --> 34:47.719
Yours or mine?

34:52.524 --> 34:53.625
- Mine.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.232
I don't wanna see you anymore.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.368
I want you to go away.

35:04.903 --> 35:09.275
- You just can't wish me
into a cornfield, Davy.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.776
Doesn't work that way.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.445
- But I can sure as hell try.

35:16.548 --> 35:19.351
- You'll die without me.
- No.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.188
Ever since the beginning,

35:22.221 --> 35:24.290
I just wanted to
do the right thing.

35:24.323 --> 35:29.127
I find someone who truly makes
me happy and you blow that.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.231
You can't stand the fact

35:32.264 --> 35:33.799
that you're not the most
important thing in my life.

35:33.832 --> 35:37.403
I have things I want
that don't include you.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.274
Maybe,

35:42.308 --> 35:45.777
maybe one day
things will change.

35:45.811 --> 35:49.715
But they won't until
you give me some space.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.787
Just for a while, okay?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.357
Just for a while.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.905
Just for a while, please.

36:28.787 --> 36:29.821
Okay.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.524
Okay.

36:34.426 --> 36:35.427
Goodbye, Vince.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.263
* Hallelujah

36:37.296 --> 36:39.231
* Hallelujah

36:39.265 --> 36:43.635
* Hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah

36:56.315 --> 36:57.916
- You're welcome.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.290
- You're late.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.391
- Dude, whatever.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.625
Are you the guy or not?

37:06.658 --> 37:08.294
I don't got time for this shit.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.428
- I'm the guy.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.800
I never shake the devil's hand.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.608
You realize I was
about two seconds

37:22.641 --> 37:24.843
from walking out that door?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.478
- No chains on that booth.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.314
- No money at yours.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.316
- It's coming.

37:30.349 --> 37:33.285
- Is it gonna be here sometime
between now and New Year's?

37:33.319 --> 37:34.686
- Have faith.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.288
- In you?

37:36.322 --> 37:39.291
Not in your fucking life.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.293
So, what kept you?

37:41.327 --> 37:42.794
- Traffic.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.730
- A lot of traffic
on that sidewalk?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.833
- Being in a hurry is
not a big priority to me.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.001
- That I can work with.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.339
- So?

37:54.373 --> 37:55.774
Are we doing this?

37:55.807 --> 37:57.476
- If I get my money.

37:57.509 --> 38:01.313
So long as we're
clear on that fact.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.382
- That's not clear for a second.

38:03.415 --> 38:06.885
We haven't discussed a price
yet, just your startup cash.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.621
- And?
- And how much is it?

38:09.655 --> 38:11.490
- Does it matter?

38:11.523 --> 38:14.092
If I told you it were a
million dollars right now,

38:14.125 --> 38:15.894
you'd find a way.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.696
- I don't know where
I'd find a million.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.366
- The same place you're
gonna find 38 grand.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.570
- Oh, wow.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.472
That's a little higher
than I expected.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.441
I was thinking five, maybe 10.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.677
- You thought wrong.

38:31.710 --> 38:35.080
My usual fee, 25.

38:35.113 --> 38:39.718
Plus a 50% markup 'cause
I just don't like you.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.389
Totals 38.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.459
- I don't know if
I can swing that.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.695
- You'll find a way.

38:49.728 --> 38:53.565
Wouldn't wanna waste
my time or anything.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.467
- Not if I can help it.

38:55.501 --> 38:56.868
- See?

38:56.902 --> 38:58.937
You're lying again.

38:58.970 --> 39:02.574
Trust me, dishonesty
doesn't suit you.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.117
10 minutes.

39:12.150 --> 39:15.053
- I don't know
what's keeping him.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.121
- Him?

39:16.154 --> 39:17.389
- My contact.

39:21.159 --> 39:26.097
- Okay, well, does
nebulous contact

39:26.131 --> 39:28.900
know you're on the clock, right?

39:28.934 --> 39:31.136
- He's gonna get you your money.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.104
- I'm a patient person.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.640
Tolerant, even.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.074
But there's a big difference

39:36.107 --> 39:37.943
between patient
with a first-timer

39:37.976 --> 39:42.414
and a client who's
a disorganized,

39:45.183 --> 39:47.018
- Gold digger?

39:47.052 --> 39:49.988
- No gal pays someone
else to off their spouse

39:50.021 --> 39:53.124
unless there's a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.126
Just pointing that out.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.128
- Still, it doesn't matter.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.798
I'm your client and
you work for me.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.100
- Not till I take
your money, I don't.

40:02.133 --> 40:06.071
I'm walking at 6:30,
money or not, got me?

40:07.506 --> 40:10.976
6:21, plenty of time.

40:11.009 --> 40:14.580
- And I prefer not to spend
it in this shithole diner.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.114
- Sorry for the delay.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.483
I was a little tied up.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.817
You guys ready to order?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.586
- Not hungry.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.454
- We're gonna be open
for a little bit,

40:22.488 --> 40:24.122
in case you change your mind.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.857
- It's okay.

40:25.891 --> 40:28.860
I suspect I'll be
leaving pretty soon.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.128
- And you?

40:30.161 --> 40:32.230
- Maybe later.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.733
- Maybe later, then.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.903
- I'm gonna head to the
little girls' room, okay?

40:37.936 --> 40:39.571
- Good, get lost.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.552
- You got this.

40:53.585 --> 40:56.955
You're fronting the money,
you're taking the risk.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.090
We're doing things my way.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.126
I'm not gonna let
you push me around.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.128
My money, my deal.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.163
I demand a better deal.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.900
I'm getting a better deal.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.242
- Thought you fell in.

41:17.275 --> 41:21.547
- New price, 10 grand, and
it's not up for discussion.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.582
- What the hell
happened in there?

41:23.615 --> 41:25.584
- I think it's fair.

41:25.617 --> 41:28.620
- And this is your expert
opinion about these matters?

41:28.654 --> 41:31.156
- I know what's right is right.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.159
- There you go waving
that word around again.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.728
- I gave you a chance
to do the right thing.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.597
You didn't, now I have to.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.165
- You wouldn't the right thing

41:40.198 --> 41:42.300
if some fellow stuck
it in your G-string.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.936
- Been checking on me?

41:44.970 --> 41:47.606
- Hey, I don't judge.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.978
- Can we turn on the
AC in here, please?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.880
- It's busted.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.748
- Of course it is.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.249
- What?

41:58.283 --> 42:00.652
Can't take the heat?

42:00.686 --> 42:03.822
- What do you do with
the money anyways?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.891
You stack it in a
safe or something?

42:05.924 --> 42:07.626
Hang on to it for a rainy day?

42:07.659 --> 42:10.962
- Why are you having
me waste your beloved?

42:10.996 --> 42:13.164
- The dude is fucking cuckoo.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.766
- Guys are simple.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.838
I had this job a
couple years back.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.174
Guy wanted me to
take out his wife.

42:23.208 --> 42:28.980
You know, whatever, standard
job, get it all the time.

42:29.014 --> 42:32.918
This bald, lanky, Coke-bottle
glasses wearing motherfucker

42:32.951 --> 42:35.821
would spend his whole
day sitting on his ass

42:35.854 --> 42:37.823
playing computer games.

42:37.856 --> 42:42.861
His wife was an
obstetrician, pretty gal.

42:42.894 --> 42:46.197
Never made the runway,
but from what I hear,

42:46.231 --> 42:50.135
her IQ is the 4th percentile.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.971
She would have been going
places, not for that long.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.040
So one day they
have an argument.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.042
One thing leads to another

42:57.075 --> 42:59.978
and she put the proverbial
gun to his head and says,

43:00.011 --> 43:05.183
"You got two choices,
get a job or get out."

43:05.216 --> 43:07.318
So, he gave me a call.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.355
- Did you do it?

43:12.357 --> 43:14.993
- Didn't have to.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.962
The guy up and keeled over

43:16.995 --> 43:20.165
the day before we
were supposed to meet.

43:20.198 --> 43:22.033
Pulmonary embolism.

43:22.067 --> 43:24.936
Turns out you can only sit
on your ass for so long

43:24.970 --> 43:27.172
before life catches up with you.

43:27.205 --> 43:29.174
- And why are you
so happy about it?

43:29.207 --> 43:30.876
The guy died.

43:30.909 --> 43:34.813
- Two reasons, his
death was no big loss,

43:34.846 --> 43:37.683
and his wife kept up
her end of the bargain.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.985
To death do them part.

43:40.018 --> 43:42.187
I still keep tabs on
her from time to time.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.222
She's doing better.

43:45.757 --> 43:48.193
- Would you have done it?

43:48.226 --> 43:50.261
- If he hadn't curled?

43:51.730 --> 43:54.132
I think about that sometimes.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.401
- What's your family
think of what you do?

43:56.434 --> 43:58.670
They must be so proud.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.440
- A lot of people
hate their jobs.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.843
But they still do them.

44:07.212 --> 44:08.847
I'm no different.

44:10.348 --> 44:11.783
- He's here.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.922
- He's not here until he's here.

44:16.955 --> 44:18.156
Three.

44:19.925 --> 44:20.959
Two.

44:32.738 --> 44:36.241
Nah, you know what?

44:36.274 --> 44:38.376
I'm not even gonna ask.

44:38.409 --> 44:40.245
I don't care.

45:20.451 --> 45:23.254
Go ahead, Romeo, scratch away.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.077
- Nothing.

45:48.046 --> 45:51.817
- I'm gonna consider
this a victory.

45:51.850 --> 45:53.919
It's been a pleasure.

45:53.952 --> 45:54.986
It hasn't.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.158
- We're not done yet.

46:00.191 --> 46:03.962
- You're entitled
to your opinion.

46:03.995 --> 46:05.797
- Thank you, Jason.

46:11.236 --> 46:12.938
- I like your lap dog.

46:12.971 --> 46:16.875
He knows when to
keep his mouth shut.

46:16.908 --> 46:19.010
- This is a big operation.

46:19.044 --> 46:20.912
I don't know what
to tell you, Randy,

46:20.946 --> 46:24.215
but we don't exactly need
Santas after Christmas.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.817
- It's Randall.

46:25.851 --> 46:28.186
Don't call me Randy.

46:28.219 --> 46:31.022
And yeah, I get it,
but come on, Barrett.

46:31.056 --> 46:33.224
- Look, I like
you, I always have.

46:33.258 --> 46:35.093
But revenues are down.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.194
You know if I had something
it would be yours,

46:36.227 --> 46:37.829
you know that.

46:38.964 --> 46:40.431
But there's no money.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.001
No money, no jobs.

46:43.034 --> 46:46.237
- I appreciate that, but--
- No buts.

46:46.271 --> 46:48.306
That's it.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.876
Look, if anything opens up,
you're at the top of my list.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.077
Till then.

46:53.244 --> 46:55.313
- So where does that leave me?

46:55.346 --> 46:57.482
- Somewhere else.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.986
- You know, I just,
I don't accept that.

47:01.019 --> 47:03.221
I will do anything, anything.

47:03.254 --> 47:06.191
I'll pick up garbage
with a pointy stick.

47:06.224 --> 47:08.226
- Hey, I had to let go of
three maintenance workers

47:08.259 --> 47:09.895
just last week.

47:15.066 --> 47:16.902
- Do you remember that story
on the news a while back

47:16.935 --> 47:19.404
about the, I don't
know, it was like,

47:19.437 --> 47:21.907
78 people stood in line all day

47:21.940 --> 47:24.209
for a temp job washing dishes?

47:24.242 --> 47:26.011
- Yeah, sure.

47:26.044 --> 47:28.947
- Guys with degrees got
passed over for that.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.215
What chance do I have out there

47:30.248 --> 47:33.018
with things like that going on?

47:33.051 --> 47:35.253
- I couldn't tell ya.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.222
But you're resourceful.

47:37.255 --> 47:38.856
I have faith in ya.

47:40.358 --> 47:44.229
- I can't buy food
with faith, Barrett.

47:44.262 --> 47:45.396
- Yeah, I know.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.970
- Fine.

47:52.003 --> 47:53.939
I'll just knock off
a bank or something,

47:53.972 --> 47:55.273
maybe that will keep my family
fed for a couple of weeks.

47:55.306 --> 47:57.675
- Don't talk like that.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.244
You don't mean that.

47:59.277 --> 48:01.212
It's counterproductive.

48:01.246 --> 48:05.083
You're a good man, you work
hard, you'll find a job.

48:06.284 --> 48:08.219
- We'll see.

48:12.057 --> 48:14.259
- Yeah, it's Barrett.

48:14.292 --> 48:15.593
Hey, hon, no.

48:15.626 --> 48:16.661
Yeah, no, no.

48:16.694 --> 48:18.396
That's fine.

48:18.429 --> 48:21.432
Yeah, no, nothing
really that important.

48:21.466 --> 48:23.468
Hold on a sec.

48:23.501 --> 48:26.237
Hey, just bring that outfit
back when you get a chance,

48:26.271 --> 48:27.672
all right?

48:27.705 --> 48:29.074
No rush, Randy.

48:31.076 --> 48:33.178
Mm-hmm.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.258
- You never agreed
to my condition.

48:47.292 --> 48:49.961
- Still sore over that?

48:49.995 --> 48:53.231
- If you're not doing
it, hand over my bag.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.100
- Yours?

48:55.133 --> 48:56.701
Shit!

48:56.734 --> 48:58.503
You are delusional.

49:00.638 --> 49:03.008
What constitutes yours?

49:04.209 --> 49:06.311
I want this, so it's mine.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.715
Why did he not go
over to get it anyway?

49:10.748 --> 49:12.683
'Cause he sure as fuck
didn't scrape it together

49:12.717 --> 49:14.319
by his lonesome.

49:15.420 --> 49:17.322
- Couldn't tell ya.

49:17.355 --> 49:19.190
- Sure, just like you
don't know whether or not

49:19.224 --> 49:21.259
you're gonna dump
your little boy toy

49:21.292 --> 49:25.663
the second you get all
your dead bull's money.

49:25.696 --> 49:28.266
- You're so clever, aren't you?

49:28.299 --> 49:32.470
- See you in Lyon, I'll
bring the croissants.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.610
- The bag stays.

49:39.644 --> 49:43.281
- You realize there's
no going back now.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.050
- Change the price.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.790
- All right, 10 grand.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.625
- Good.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.163
I'd ask you to shake on it,

49:58.196 --> 49:59.730
but I know how
you feel about it.

50:04.235 --> 50:08.139
Here's to hoping we
never speak again.

50:08.173 --> 50:09.207
- De gratia.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.628
- Hey.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.502
So, get any good shots?

50:37.535 --> 50:39.704
- Couple.

50:39.737 --> 50:42.073
- They're gonna
make you rich and famous?

50:42.107 --> 50:43.274
- I doubt I'll be
as famous as Avedon,

50:43.308 --> 50:45.276
but it's an interesting hobby.

51:12.403 --> 51:13.371
- Randy!

51:13.404 --> 51:14.372
Don't!

51:14.405 --> 51:15.606
Dry cleaning!

51:15.640 --> 51:16.874
- Don't call me Randy!

51:16.907 --> 51:19.110
- I was serious, man!

51:19.144 --> 51:22.847
You mess that up, I'll have to
send you the bill, all right?

51:24.315 --> 51:25.550
- You know what?

51:25.583 --> 51:27.218
You don't like what I'm doing

51:27.252 --> 51:28.419
to your precious
little fucking outfit?

51:28.453 --> 51:30.421
Then you go ahead and bill me.

51:30.455 --> 51:34.759
You bought it on clearance
at Sears, fake fucking suit!

51:39.397 --> 51:41.832
Don't look at me that way!

51:41.866 --> 51:44.269
- Merry fucking Christmas!

51:51.342 --> 51:56.281
* What is it about
this time of year

51:56.314 --> 52:01.319
* Keeps us so happy
and on a cheer

52:01.352 --> 52:05.723
* Wherever you go
there's people smiling

52:06.957 --> 52:09.394
* 'Cause it's Christmastime

52:09.427 --> 52:13.264
* And we're feeling fine

52:15.233 --> 52:19.904
* Share a little
bit of magic with me

52:19.937 --> 52:24.909
* Whistle throughout the land

52:24.942 --> 52:29.880
* Christmas is a time
when the love light shines

52:29.914 --> 52:34.919
* Go on and build
that big snowman

52:34.952 --> 52:39.790
* Share a little
bit of magic with me

52:39.824 --> 52:44.862
* Whistle throughout the land

52:44.895 --> 52:49.834
* Christmas is a time
when the love light shines

52:49.867 --> 52:54.372
* Watching the snow
flakes melt in my hand

52:57.275 --> 53:01.912
* What is it about
this time of year

53:01.946 --> 53:06.917
* The firelight
warms away our fears

53:06.951 --> 53:12.390
* Sharing the songs
that ring inside us

53:12.423 --> 53:14.859
* 'Cause it's Christmastime

53:14.892 --> 53:18.529
* And we're feeling fine

53:20.731 --> 53:25.603
* Share a little
bit of magic with me

53:25.636 --> 53:29.740
* Whistle throughout the land

53:31.576 --> 53:35.313
- So your lady friend
is running late, huh?

53:35.346 --> 53:36.847
- Yeah.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.816
Hoping she doesn't show.

53:38.849 --> 53:40.918
- Nervous about it?

53:40.951 --> 53:43.488
- Can I get a glass
of orange juice?

53:43.521 --> 53:45.456
- Sure.

53:45.490 --> 53:47.892
I hope you don't mind me
prying, it's just my nature.

53:51.829 --> 53:56.934
* Christmas is a time
when the love light shines

53:56.967 --> 54:00.638
* Watching the snow
flakes melt in my hand

54:00.671 --> 54:03.341
- You're a little early, Santa.

54:03.374 --> 54:05.776
- Any chance you're hiring?

54:07.312 --> 54:08.413
- Mm, no.

54:09.714 --> 54:11.516
- Ever?

54:11.549 --> 54:15.520
- Times are tough, but
I can see what I can do.

54:20.691 --> 54:22.860
Don't run off with that
pen, that's my favorite.

54:28.599 --> 54:29.934
You okay?

54:31.369 --> 54:32.970
I mean, for real?

54:34.372 --> 54:35.406
- Sure.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.610
It's just been a
tough couple weeks.

54:41.512 --> 54:43.414
- Yeah, I hear ya.

54:45.816 --> 54:49.320
Well, don't rush,
take your time.

54:49.354 --> 54:52.690
- Yeah, people keep
telling me that.

54:52.723 --> 54:54.525
- Telling you what?

54:57.528 --> 54:59.430
- Never mind.

55:01.366 --> 55:02.900
- Okay.

55:02.933 --> 55:04.569
I'll be damned if
I'm gonna let Santa

55:04.602 --> 55:06.604
walk into my diner
on Christmas Eve

55:06.637 --> 55:09.840
looking like he just got a
lump of coal in his stocking.

55:14.445 --> 55:17.014
- It's really not necessary.

55:18.516 --> 55:21.386
- Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

55:23.688 --> 55:26.090
I'll leave you to do that.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.674
- Yeah.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.476
- Where are you?

55:45.510 --> 55:49.414
- I just had
to make a quick stop.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.750
- You're not at the?

55:54.419 --> 55:55.720
Randy?
- No.

55:55.753 --> 55:57.755
No, of course not.

55:57.788 --> 55:58.856
- You swear?

55:58.889 --> 56:01.125
- I am not drinking.

56:01.158 --> 56:04.028
I swear on my goddamn life,
I swear on Abby's life.

56:04.061 --> 56:06.964
- Randy, don't blaspheme,
you know better.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.567
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

56:11.001 --> 56:13.971
- How did it go with Barrett?

56:14.004 --> 56:16.140
- Well, I
mean, best case scenario

56:16.173 --> 56:19.410
I'm gonna be the Easter Bunny.

56:19.444 --> 56:20.945
- April?

56:20.978 --> 56:23.147
- Yeah,
last time I checked.

56:23.180 --> 56:24.482
- So?

56:24.515 --> 56:25.950
- So, I'm trying.

56:25.983 --> 56:28.185
It's gonna take some time.

56:28.218 --> 56:29.620
- Then try harder.

56:29.654 --> 56:31.689
- Kasey, I know, okay?

56:31.722 --> 56:34.459
Look, I'll be home soon, okay?

56:35.493 --> 56:37.194
- All right, bye.

56:51.542 --> 56:53.644
- My condolences.

56:57.181 --> 56:58.916
That sounded rough.

57:00.050 --> 57:02.186
- Yeah, I bet.

57:02.219 --> 57:04.955
- Hey, it's Christmas.

57:04.989 --> 57:08.793
Everybody is miserable
at Christmas.

57:12.663 --> 57:14.465
- Tell me about it.

57:27.144 --> 57:28.445
You're welcome.

57:29.914 --> 57:33.250
- Mommy, can I talk to Daddy?

57:33.283 --> 57:34.785
- Sure, baby.

57:41.759 --> 57:42.893
- Yeah.

57:42.927 --> 57:44.161
- It's me again.

57:44.194 --> 57:45.796
- Yeah, what's up?

57:45.830 --> 57:47.998
- Abby wants
to talk to you.

57:48.032 --> 57:51.201
- Just tell her I'll
be home in a few.

57:51.235 --> 57:52.870
Kasey?

57:53.838 --> 57:55.072
- Hi, Daddy.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.942
- Oh, hey, kiddo.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.977
Merry almost Christmas.

58:00.010 --> 58:02.046
- When are you coming home?

58:02.079 --> 58:04.048
- I'll be home in a little bit.

58:04.081 --> 58:05.983
- Can you come home now?

58:06.016 --> 58:08.185
- Oh, you know what,
honey, I can't right now.

58:08.218 --> 58:10.721
I got something
I gotta do first.

58:10.755 --> 58:11.956
- After?

58:11.989 --> 58:13.991
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.

58:14.024 --> 58:17.194
So, you excited
for Santa to come?

58:17.227 --> 58:19.063
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

58:19.096 --> 58:22.199
You think he's gonna
bring you something good?

58:22.232 --> 58:24.001
- I don't think so.

58:24.034 --> 58:25.736
- Oh, why not?

58:25.770 --> 58:28.573
You've been a good girl
all year, haven't you?

58:28.606 --> 58:31.308
- Does Santa ever bring money?

58:31.341 --> 58:32.610
- Money?

58:34.211 --> 58:37.982
Why would you want money
over some awesome toys?

58:38.015 --> 58:40.117
I mean, that's just
nonsense, baby.

58:40.150 --> 58:42.753
- I want money so
we can pay doctors

58:42.787 --> 58:44.789
so they can make me all better.

58:54.031 --> 58:58.002
- Abby, I want you to listen
to me very carefully, okay?

58:58.035 --> 59:00.905
Your mommy and me, we got
all that worked out, okay?

59:00.938 --> 59:02.740
I mean, you don't have to
worry about any of that.

59:02.773 --> 59:05.776
Whatever it takes, we're
gonna take care of you,

59:05.810 --> 59:07.578
you hear me?

59:07.612 --> 59:09.880
Whatever it takes.

59:09.914 --> 59:12.116
Now, what do you wanna do
about supper tonight, mm?

59:12.149 --> 59:13.951
We can go anywhere
you want, anywhere.

59:13.984 --> 59:16.353
- Maggie's, I want
mashed potatoes.

59:18.155 --> 59:22.159
- Mashed potatoes,
yes, then that's it,

59:22.192 --> 59:24.261
that's what we'll
do, Maggie's, yeah.

59:24.294 --> 59:28.232
Hey, honey, will you put
your mom back on, please?

59:28.265 --> 59:29.867
- Okay, Daddy.

59:33.237 --> 59:34.639
- Yeah.

59:34.672 --> 59:36.206
- What the hell was that about?

59:36.240 --> 59:38.008
- Gimme one sec, okay?

59:38.042 --> 59:40.177
Honey, why don't you
go get ready, okay?

59:40.210 --> 59:41.712
So we can leave.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.215
- Kase?

59:45.249 --> 59:46.717
- Yeah, I'm here.

59:46.751 --> 59:47.785
- How does she know about that?

59:47.818 --> 59:49.754
- I don't know,

59:49.787 --> 59:51.722
she must have overheard us
at the appointment today.

59:51.756 --> 59:54.024
- But you
reassured her, right?

59:54.058 --> 59:55.826
- Yep, I lied.

59:55.860 --> 59:58.863
- Hey, hey, it's not
lying, you hear me?

59:58.896 --> 01:00:02.299
It's not lying, everything
is gonna be okay.

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:04.034
- How can you say that?

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.235
- Okay,
just hang on a second.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.271
Let me get off the road.

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:11.008
Okay, there we go.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:14.144
But listen, I mean it,
everything's gonna fine.

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:16.080
- Fine?

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:20.851
We don't have money coming
in for months, Randy.

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:24.154
- Look, there's still a
lot of places out there

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:26.056
that are hiring.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.993
- As a burger flipper
making two bucks an hour?

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:31.028
- As opposed to what, huh?

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:34.198
You think I was rolling in
cash playing Santa for a month?

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:35.265
- Well, no.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:39.036
Where are you now?

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:41.205
- Just outside
some liquor store.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:42.873
- What?

01:00:42.907 --> 01:00:45.209
What the hell are
you doing there?

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:47.111
- I think I got a way

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.114
for us to get some money
for Abby's treatment.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.049
I just gotta make it
through the holidays

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:54.418
and we can talk
about it later, okay?

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:55.853
- All right.

01:00:55.886 --> 01:00:57.254
Are you gonna meet us there?

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:00.891
- At Maggie's, yeah.

01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:03.227
I'll be there in
10 or 15 minutes.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.229
- All right.

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:07.932
I love you.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:10.300
Bye.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:33.290
- Hey.

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:55.245
- Drop the weapon!
- Down now!

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.847
- Drop the weapon!

01:01:56.881 --> 01:01:58.015
Put your hands up!
- Hands up!

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.249
- Let me see your hands!

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:01.118
Let me see your hands!

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:02.219
Hands behind your head!
- Hey, hey, it wasn't me.

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:03.287
- Watch the gun.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.191
- It's not mine,
there was a guy.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:08.959
- Yeah, yeah,
right, shut the hell up.

01:02:08.993 --> 01:02:10.227
- No, I'm telling
you, there was a guy.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.495
He was robbing the store.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.163
- Yes, there is, yes, he was.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.899
Hand behind your
back, there we go.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:17.067
Hold right there,
don't you fucking move.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.335
All right, you got the gun?
- Got it.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:19.837
- Good, stand up.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.038
- It wasn't me.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.106
- You got a name?

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:23.841
- Yeah, Randall.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.442
Randall Edwards, but
you got the wrong guy.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.277
I swear I wasn't robbing
the goddamn store.

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:29.079
- Yeah, just like it
wasn't your goddamn gun.

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:31.115
- It's not, I don't
even believe in them.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:32.449
Listen to me, there was a guy
who tear-assed outta here,

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:35.052
and I heard three shots.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:36.921
- Watch your head.
- Listen to me.

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:39.156
There was one, and then
there was two back to back

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:41.525
and then he came
out and took off

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:43.227
and then you guys showed up.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.163
- You got a description
of this guy?

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.266
- Yeah, he's a white
guy, kinda young,

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:55.039
and he's wearing
a Santa suit also.

01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:57.141
- So you're saying that
two guys in Santa suits

01:02:57.174 --> 01:03:01.378
just happened to be at the
same store at the same time?

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.413
- It's Christmas.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.583
- Look, Randall, you're under
arrest for armed robbery.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.318
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.553
Anything you say can
and will be used--

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:10.921
- Just stop.

01:03:10.955 --> 01:03:12.422
- Excuse me?

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.058
- Don't bother, man.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:15.592
- So, let's be clear.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.228
You're waiving your
Miranda rights, right?

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:21.198
- Yeah, just please stop.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:24.835
- Okay, Randy, listen,
if we dust that gun,

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:27.271
whose prints are
gonna come back?

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.274
- Mine, let me explain.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.042
He came out of the
store and dropped it.

01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:33.277
I accidentally picked it up.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.912
- You accidentally picked it up?

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:36.446
Get the fuck outta here.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.882
You know, if you
make this easy on me,

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.149
I'll make it easy on you.

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:40.217
- James.
- Yeah.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.852
- Clerk's down.

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:43.053
She's already gone,
I called it in.

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:44.188
- You get a name?

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.856
- Heather Harrington.

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:48.125
- Was that you, Randy?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.261
I got an alarm, I got a
gun, I got a dead woman,

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.497
and I got you, look
at me, goddammit!

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.066
And you're telling me this
was some other Santa Claus

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.937
and some astrological event
happened or something like that.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.506
You wanna try me again, Randy?

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.911
- Don't call me Randy.

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:08.979
- All right, whatever.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.270
Merry Christmas.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:34.338
- Merry Christmas.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.505
- How's your day?

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.207
- Interesting.
- Ha.

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:39.910
- Where's Homicide?

01:04:39.944 --> 01:04:41.278
- They're dragging ass as usual.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.013
So, here's what we got:

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:44.448
Santa Claus there
is your trigger man.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.316
his real name is
Randall Edwards.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.054
The clerk is, was Heather
Harrington, she's DOA.

01:04:50.087 --> 01:04:53.057
Ambulance is in route, there's
no sign of the money yet

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.459
and this one was a silent alarm.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:56.927
- Just another
Christmas Eve, huh?

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:15.105
- Bad day?

01:06:15.139 --> 01:06:17.207
- Huh?

01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:19.309
- Normally, when I get
guys in here on Christmas,

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:20.777
it's not 'cause they're
having a good day,

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.512
you know what I mean?

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:26.116
- Yeah, yeah, just
one of those days.

01:06:29.053 --> 01:06:31.221
- Maybe you're looking
for a little pick-me-up?

01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:37.361
Not like that, you perv.

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:43.100
- No, no, I'm okay.
- Come on, it's on me.

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:44.701
Unless you wanna keep
being a sad sack,

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.670
but to tell you the truth,

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:49.306
I'm gonna try and polish
off this bottle myself, so.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:01.618
Don't even worry about it,
it hasn't worked in years.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:26.543
You're not much of
a drinker, are you?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.778
- Not really.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.780
- The second one always
goes down easier.

01:07:38.122 --> 01:07:40.390
Is that your girlfriend?

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.330
- How'd you know?

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.098
- Don't you know?

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:50.667
We all got intuition
about these things.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.404
- Yeah, she said
something like that.

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:56.406
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:00.444
I'm guessing the love boat
is sinking, though, right?

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.347
- Why would you say that?

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.215
- Well, you're here.

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:06.316
- Yeah.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:12.322
She kinda asked me to.

01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:14.591
- Mm, it's my kinda girl.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.261
You wanna hook me
up with her digits?

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:23.433
- You ever, uh.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.305
I mean.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:36.313
You love someone

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:41.618
but you hate how
they make you feel.

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:44.120
- So why stay with them?

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:47.591
Look, no, no, no.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.559
I'm the worst person you
should ask to for advice.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:52.929
I mean, my last boyfriend
was like a serial cheater.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.732
And I ain't got no family,
except for my sister,

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.600
but I haven't talked
to her in years.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:01.337
- Okay, well, let's just
say for argument sake

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.407
that's all moot.

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:11.215
- All right, so if she's
more of a ball and chain

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:14.318
than she is a magnet,
just dump her.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.386
I mean, unless you're Hindu,
you only got one shot at life,

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.323
so why spend it with someone
who makes you feel like shit,

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:20.924
you know?

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:23.527
- Because I love her.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.363
- Look, you ain't got to
tell me that, all right?

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:28.631
If you love her, make
sure you show her,

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:29.933
show her how you feel.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.301
Don't just recite the words.

01:09:32.336 --> 01:09:36.506
Just don't become a
slave to her is all.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.942
- Thanks for the pep talk.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.411
- Heather.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.479
- Yeah, yeah.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.381
I got that from your name tag.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:48.852
- I'm John.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.923
- John?

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:56.493
Okay, John, you don't
have to lie to me, John.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.494
I don't judge.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:09:59.963
- What do you mean?

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:02.966
- Shh, intuition, remember?

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:08.338
All right, so, it's gonna be

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:13.243
13.95, John.

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:16.246
Don't be a stranger, John.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.349
- Could I get a lottery ticket?

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:21.951
- Yeah, you want
a nice purple one?

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.953
- Yeah, whatever is cheapest.

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:25.221
- Okay, so.

01:10:30.394 --> 01:10:31.961
What are you doing?

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:34.331
- I'm sorry, I need the money.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.832
- All right--
- Okay, shut up, okay?

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.368
Just do it.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:40.904
- And we'll both just pretend
like this never happened,
all right?

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.339
- Look, shut up.
- You don't have to do--

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:44.374
- Just shut up, okay?

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.875
- Please.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.578
- As soon as I get the
money, I'm outta here.

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:06.029
- No, no, no, that's not enough.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:09.366
I need at least three
grand from that safe.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:10.967
- We don't even keep
that much in here.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.770
- Well, then give
me what you do have.

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:25.582
- Why you doing this, all right?

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.517
- It doesn't matter.

01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:29.486
- It does matter because
you could just walk away.

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:30.920
- No, I can't.

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:34.023
I love her.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:35.692
- She's making you do this?

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:38.428
- Stop fucking stalling.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.022
- I don't know why you
just don't go to the cops.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:10.360
I mean, she's obviously
blackmailing you, right?

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:20.870
- Oh, no, fuck!

01:12:24.408 --> 01:12:26.109
I'm sorry, no, no, no.

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:27.377
Stay with me.

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:28.445
Stay with me, come on!

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:29.813
I'm so sorry!

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:31.715
No!

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.388
Fuck!

01:12:38.422 --> 01:12:39.756
Goddammit!

01:13:03.447 --> 01:13:05.415
- Hey.

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:05.642
- Nah, you know what?

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:08.211
I'm not even gonna ask.

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:09.679
I don't care.

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:52.656
Go ahead, Romeo, scratch away.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.726
- Nothing.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.998
- I'm gonna consider
this a victory.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.233
It's been a pleasure.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.602
It hasn't.

01:15:41.905 --> 01:15:43.607
- We're not done yet.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.243
- You're entitled
to your opinion.

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.912
- Thank you, Jason.

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:56.019
- I like your lap dog.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:58.822
He knows when to
keep his mouth shut.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.289
- Come on, Davy.

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:02.358
You can dig better than that.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.093
Come on, faster!

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:06.596
Dig, motherfucker, come on!

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.865
* Holy Night

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:11.034
Dig that hole, move, move!

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:15.071
See, that's what you get for
not wanting to chop her up.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:16.840
Now you gotta dig a bigger hole.

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:19.776
* All is bright

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:24.748
* Round yon Virgin

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:30.153
* Mother and Child

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:33.890
- Santa!

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:36.225
- Hey, kiddo, Merry Christmas!

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.928
- Mom, he called me kiddo
just like Daddy does.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.264
- I heard him, baby.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:43.032
- Are you really Santa?

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.734
You don't look like him.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:46.002
- I don't?

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.637
Why do you say that?

01:16:47.671 --> 01:16:50.039
- You just don't.
- Abby.

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:55.044
- Huh, I kinda like that.

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:57.613
You got me, I'm not Santa.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:03.219
But you've seen a lot of
Santas around town, right?

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:06.890
Stores, malls, stuff
like that, right?

01:17:06.923 --> 01:17:08.725
- My daddy does that.
- Yes, he does.

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.660
- Yeah, Santa Claus, right?

01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:15.699
He's awesome, he's magical
and shit, I mean, stuff.

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:17.834
But let's face it, Santa Claus,

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.670
he can't be at all
places at all times.

01:17:20.704 --> 01:17:22.371
So he needs helpers.

01:17:22.405 --> 01:17:24.240
Like your daddy and me.

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:27.777
- You know what I
want for Christmas?

01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:32.415
- I couldn't tell you,
but if you tell me,

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:37.253
I'll make sure the big guy
gets the memo, okay, Abby?

01:17:40.123 --> 01:17:43.359
- Mommy, he knows my name!
- He does.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.762
- Go ahead.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:57.273
- Well, Santa's got his
work cut out for him.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:02.378
But I'll make sure Santa Claus
knows to do his best, okay?

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.381
- Okay.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.285
- Abby, why don't you go
inside, get us a table?

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:11.487
I'm gonna have a little talk
here with Santa's helper, okay?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.723
- Okay, Mommy.

01:18:15.892 --> 01:18:17.126
- Hey, look.

01:18:18.762 --> 01:18:20.797
I'm sorry if I got too close.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:24.267
- No, you seem good with kids.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.335
- How long has
your daughter been?

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:27.436
- Sick?

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:32.041
Four months, this time.

01:18:32.075 --> 01:18:34.744
- It's nothing to
be ashamed about.

01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:36.913
I understand.

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:39.315
- No, you don't understand.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:44.287
And I praise God every
single day for each person

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.090
who doesn't understand.

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:50.393
- How much does all
that medical stuff cost?

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:51.761
- Too much.

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:59.135
I should get going, she's
probably looking for me, so.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:00.336
- Wait.

01:19:02.806 --> 01:19:04.173
Take this.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:14.150
Just take it.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:17.053
- I can't take this from you.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.555
- I don't want it.
- Why?

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.058
- It doesn't matter, okay?

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.293
Just make sure--
- It's $250,000!

01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:27.430
- Just make sure that you
help your kid with that.

01:19:27.463 --> 01:19:30.299
- Mom, when are you coming?

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:32.068
- I'm coming, baby,
I'm coming, Abby.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:33.269
I'll be right there.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.171
I don't know what to give you.

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:38.107
I don't know, I have
nothing to give you but this

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:40.343
and you need to take this.

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:45.048
It's what's right.

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:53.957
Merry Christmas.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:00.897
- You know what your daughter
wanted for Christmas?

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.065
She said she just
wants to be normal

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:03.833
like all the other kids.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.237
- Thank you.

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:09.505
Thank you.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:15.979
* Silent Night

01:20:16.012 --> 01:20:18.481
* Holy Night

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:22.351
* All is calm

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:26.355
* All is bright

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.466
- Oh my god.

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:42.271
Is he?

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:44.440
- Call 911.

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:46.109
Call 911.

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:07.063
- Dissing my car.
- Would I.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:11.300
- You wanna kill me?

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:12.868
Okay, let's go.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:26.382
- Fuck!

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:27.483
Fuck!

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.189
Fuck!

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.291
- Merry Christmas, girls.

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:36.459
Mashed potatoes?

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:39.929
And chicken pot pie.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.168
- Do you know of a man, came
in here in the last hour or so?

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.303
- Well, I've had
my share tonight.

01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:49.338
What's your type?

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:51.340
- Mid-40s, a big haggard.

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:53.309
- Dressed like Santa Claus?

01:21:53.342 --> 01:21:55.044
- That's him.

01:21:55.078 --> 01:21:57.180
- Yeah, he was in
right before six,

01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:01.050
he asked for a job application
and then he just took off.

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:04.988
Oh, you know what,
he did leave this behind.

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:07.590
- He just left it?

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.325
- Yep.

01:22:10.326 --> 01:22:11.394
Enjoy.

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.455
- Good morning, ma'am.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.323
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I have some bad news

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:16.359
regarding your husband.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:17.760
- No, no.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:19.795
- Some details are
being released.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.497
Except that the prime suspect

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:23.399
in the Magnolia
Liquor Store robbery,

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:26.369
Randall Edwards, a
47-year-old Glendale resident,

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:30.339
has reportedly committed
suicide while in police custody.

01:23:30.373 --> 01:23:33.342
Officials are not releasing
any further information

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:35.244
at this time.

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:36.779
Reporting from North
Hollywood, I'm Nick Sanchez.

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:40.516
- What seems to have originated
with a botched robbery

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:43.352
and the murder of a clerk
here at Magnolia Liquor

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:45.154
at Hollywood Boulevard.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.056
The clerk, Heather Harrington,

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:50.159
was pronounced
dead at the scene.

01:23:50.193 --> 01:23:52.595
And the authorities suggest
that the perpetrator

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:57.366
was actively involved in the
death of Officer DeJesus.

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:57.553
* Silent Night

01:25:58.587 --> 01:26:01.357
* Holy Night

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:05.428
* All is calm

01:26:06.429 --> 01:26:08.964
* All is bright

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:22.978
- When did you take those?
- I took them last night.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.380
Isn't that something?

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:26.282
Santa came early.

01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:29.485
Here, I thought you
weren't the intimate type.

01:26:33.422 --> 01:26:36.225
Is this one of those
it's-not-me-it's-you things

01:26:36.259 --> 01:26:39.262
or it's-not-you-it's-me things,
whatever the fuck it is?

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:41.397
- How could you do that?
- How could I?

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:42.598
How could I?

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:44.400
I'm so glad you asked me that.

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:46.001
I mean, while you were
kissing him in the dark,

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:48.837
I had to open the
aperture to an f-3.5.

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:50.439
The ISO was a bitch.
- David.

01:26:50.473 --> 01:26:52.408
- But I got there--
- David, stop!

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:56.612
- When I told you I loved
you, it wasn't bullshit.

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:57.980
But you never loved me, did you?

01:26:58.013 --> 01:27:00.516
Did you?
- Of course I did.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:03.452
- Past tense.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.988
- I still do.

01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:08.457
- Get your hands off me.

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:14.430
I can't, I can't, I can't.

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:15.531
- David.

01:27:19.502 --> 01:27:20.736
- Home free.

01:27:30.446 --> 01:27:33.649
- Think I could get
a lottery ticket?

01:27:33.682 --> 01:27:36.752
- Yeah, you want
a nice purple one?

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:38.387
- Yeah, whatever is cheapest.

01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:39.522
- Okay, so.

01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:45.994
What are you doing?

01:27:46.028 --> 01:27:49.365
- I'm sorry, I need the money.

01:27:49.398 --> 01:27:51.467
- All right--
- Okay, shut up, okay?

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.869
Just do it.

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:56.004
- And we'll both just pretend
like this never happened,
all right?

01:27:56.038 --> 01:27:57.406
- Look, shut up.
- You don't have to do--

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.541
- Just shut up, okay?

01:27:58.574 --> 01:28:00.409
Just do it, please.

01:28:00.443 --> 01:28:02.010
- All right.

01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:03.646
You know, you don't have
to do this, all right?

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:05.481
You can just put the gun down

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:09.485
and we'll both pretend
like this never happened.

01:28:12.054 --> 01:28:13.889
Please.

01:30:41.069 --> 01:30:45.040
- I thought you said you
were gonna be busy with work.

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:47.042
- It's Christmas Eve.

01:30:47.075 --> 01:30:49.778
The kids couldn't
wait up for you.

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:51.514
- I can see that.

01:30:53.015 --> 01:30:54.717
Merry Christmas, baby.

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.119
- Merry Christmas
to you, sweetheart.

01:31:09.832 --> 01:31:10.999
He wanted to see you

01:31:11.033 --> 01:31:12.735
just one last time.

01:31:12.768 --> 01:31:13.836
Is this about Dad?

01:31:13.869 --> 01:31:16.071
Is that the same tree?

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:19.041
- You
didn't even ask about him.

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:20.108
You just want me to say

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:22.077
that I was wrong.

01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:23.912
- There's
nothing I want from you.

01:31:23.946 --> 01:31:24.913
- I
might propose to her.

01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:26.549
- A girl?

01:31:26.582 --> 01:31:27.583
Is that why you
stopped by, to tell me?

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:28.651
We can fix this.

01:31:31.687 --> 01:31:33.255
No, Chris, wait!

01:32:41.323 --> 01:32:46.061
- Is that the same tree?

01:32:49.297 --> 01:32:50.332
First grade.

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:56.138
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:33:16.992 --> 01:33:21.329
* It's another sunny
Christmas in LA

01:33:23.866 --> 01:33:28.236
* It's another sunny
Christmas in LA

01:33:30.673 --> 01:33:34.209
* There's a traffic jam

01:33:34.242 --> 01:33:37.345
* On the 101

01:33:37.379 --> 01:33:41.283
* And the weatherman says

01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:46.254
* Sun, sun, sun

01:33:48.924 --> 01:33:54.897
* I miss icicles and
snowballs now and then

01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:57.966
* But I've got Mickey Mouse

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.169
* And low gas bills for my house

01:34:01.203 --> 01:34:07.075
* Yeah most of all
I've got my friends

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.317
* It's another sunny
Christmas in LA

01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:19.021
* That's all right, that's okay

01:34:19.054 --> 01:34:22.090
* Santa is coming here anyway

01:34:22.124 --> 01:34:24.860
* On a big red motorcycle

01:34:24.893 --> 01:34:27.295
* Who needs a sleigh

01:34:27.329 --> 01:34:31.133
* Santa's coming anyway

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:35.771
* There's some smoke above

01:34:35.804 --> 01:34:39.107
* From a chimney top

01:34:39.141 --> 01:34:42.377
* Wait a minute, no

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:47.115
* That's just a lot of smog

01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:53.088
* But I'm so happy to be
here this time of year

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:56.091
* I won't cry and I won't pout

01:34:56.124 --> 01:34:59.461
* 'Cause I've got friends
and I'm hanging out

01:34:59.494 --> 01:35:00.963
* And my heart

01:35:00.996 --> 01:35:06.501
* Is full of love and good cheer

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:10.072
* It's another sunny
Christmas in LA

01:35:10.105 --> 01:35:13.909
* That's all right, that's okay

01:35:13.942 --> 01:35:16.745
* Santa is coming here anyway

01:35:16.779 --> 01:35:19.447
* On a big red motorcycle

01:35:19.481 --> 01:35:22.084
* Who needs a sleigh

01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:25.287
* Santa's coming anyway

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.357

01:35:58.153 --> 01:36:01.790
* It's another sunny
Christmas in LA

01:36:01.824 --> 01:36:05.193
* That's all right, that's okay

01:36:05.227 --> 01:36:08.196
* Santa is coming here anyway

01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:10.933
