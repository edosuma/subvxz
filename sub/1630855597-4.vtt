10:22.279 --> 10:25.582
That's why made the winning bid
at the symphony charity auction:

10:25.682 --> 10:28.265
Scooter's gonna
conduct the Philharmonic.

10:28.365 --> 10:30.147
I'm gonna bring him on stage,

10:30.247 --> 10:32.950
introduce him,
really blow it out.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.312
I see why that seems
like the thing to do.

10:35.412 --> 10:37.315
And for you and Scooter, holistically,

10:37.415 --> 10:39.597
it is the thing to do.

10:39.697 --> 10:41.839
But classical music
is pussy music.

10:41.939 --> 10:43.561
That's insane.

10:43.661 --> 10:44.882
Not to the voters.

10:44.982 --> 10:46.845
And to them,
people who like it...

10:46.945 --> 10:48.767
are pussies.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.869
Including you.

11:00.439 --> 11:01.580
It's like this.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.702
Al Capone can cry at Pagliacci

11:03.802 --> 11:06.185
'cause he's having a guy
murdered at the same time.

11:06.285 --> 11:08.748
Also because he's being
played by Robert De Niro.

11:08.848 --> 11:11.310
Anyone else is... effete.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.993
Uh, you used a different word
before she walked in the room.

11:14.093 --> 11:16.496
His idiolect changes based on
who he wants to affect.

11:18.498 --> 11:20.119
We've barely met,
how can you--

11:20.219 --> 11:21.921
I'm a professional evaluator
of people,

11:22.021 --> 11:23.563
so I thin-sliced it
and--

11:23.663 --> 11:25.445
Well, I'm a professional
evaluator of people

11:25.545 --> 11:28.528
and a comms strategist.
Words--

11:28.628 --> 11:31.451
Jesus, you-you like
shaking people up, don't you?

11:31.551 --> 11:34.114
Like it? I don't know.
Just happens.

11:35.916 --> 11:38.078
This is about Scooter conducting.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.343
Regardless what word
we use, yeah.

11:42.443 --> 11:45.066
No chamber music for you
or Scooter. I have to veto it.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.908
First of all,
you don't have veto power.

11:47.008 --> 11:48.509
Second, orchestral,
not chamber.

11:48.609 --> 11:50.712
Third, I'm not effete.

11:50.812 --> 11:52.814
Yeah, Mike's no pussy.

11:53.775 --> 11:55.156
[Prince] See?

11:55.256 --> 11:57.599
- I was a college athlete.
- Uh-huh.

11:57.699 --> 11:59.881
So, let's throw out the first
pitch somewhere that night

11:59.981 --> 12:01.483
instead of
going to the concerto.

12:01.583 --> 12:02.964
You think one night
at the Phil

12:03.064 --> 12:04.366
is gonna have
that much negative impact?

12:04.466 --> 12:05.807
It's not one night.

12:05.907 --> 12:08.570
It's the conversation
surrounding it.

12:08.670 --> 12:09.892
Who's your favourite
female conductor?

12:09.992 --> 12:12.374
Marin Alsop,
Baltimore Symphony.

12:12.474 --> 12:14.737
I hate that you have
that answer so fast.

12:14.837 --> 12:17.500
Okay, Baltimore,

12:17.600 --> 12:19.101
who's your favourite Oriole?

12:19.201 --> 12:21.103
Mussina. Even though
he retired a Yankee.

12:21.203 --> 12:23.205
Favourite now?

12:25.408 --> 12:27.410
Baseball's kind of dead.

12:28.571 --> 12:29.592
Tell him.

12:29.692 --> 12:31.514
You understand this shit, right?

12:31.614 --> 12:34.197
'Cause as a professional
thin slicer of people, you know

12:34.297 --> 12:37.040
classical music
makes people feel dumb.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.363
Some people. Absolutely.

12:39.463 --> 12:41.805
But are those people
Prince voters anyway?

12:41.905 --> 12:43.167
Big tent.

12:43.267 --> 12:45.089
Let's not write anyone off yet.

12:45.189 --> 12:47.131
Then cancel any and all
involvement with the symphony

12:47.231 --> 12:49.373
until they play you into the job

12:49.473 --> 12:50.734
at your inauguration.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.798
But we should have
Bocephus anyway.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.503
Wendy, do you have
a real lean here?

12:58.603 --> 13:01.826
Michael Prince is a maverick
who rewrites the rules.

13:01.926 --> 13:03.788
That's what works for him.

13:03.888 --> 13:05.390
For you.

13:05.490 --> 13:07.272
I don't see why candidate Prince
would switch that up.

13:07.372 --> 13:09.374
After all...

13:09.975 --> 13:12.157
he is the buck.

13:12.257 --> 13:14.519
I'm telling you, you've
gotta walk this back.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.062
Nope. Gonna march it forward.

13:20.826 --> 13:22.828
Eyes up!

13:23.709 --> 13:25.911
Scooter, stand with me.

13:30.756 --> 13:34.100
Team: this man.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.343
This man of many disciplines,
many skills, many talents,

13:37.443 --> 13:40.106
is about to showcase
a hidden one.

13:40.206 --> 13:41.748
Two weeks from tomorrow,

13:41.848 --> 13:45.352
he will conduct the
New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

13:45.452 --> 13:46.833
I'll be introducing him.

13:46.933 --> 13:49.436
All of you will be there
cheering him on.

13:49.536 --> 13:52.399
[cheers and applause]

13:52.499 --> 13:54.401
I was really enjoying
your fucking act

13:54.501 --> 13:57.124
until you Joe Theismanned
my ass.

13:57.224 --> 13:58.485
Like Lawrence Taylor.

13:58.585 --> 14:00.568
- That's what they pay me for.
- Hm.

14:00.668 --> 14:02.049
Look, you gotta know
you're not always gonna

14:02.149 --> 14:03.851
get your way with him.
It's not how we--

14:03.951 --> 14:05.213
You think I'm pissed because
I didn't get my way?

14:05.313 --> 14:07.175
Thank you. Thank you.

14:07.275 --> 14:09.577
It means a lot to have
the well wishes of this team.

14:09.677 --> 14:11.900
I think you're frustrated
because Prince isn't pliable

14:12.000 --> 14:13.982
the way most of your
candidates probably are.

14:14.082 --> 14:16.144
They don't start out that way.

14:16.244 --> 14:19.267
But I tell them what to do.
They do it. And then they win.

14:19.367 --> 14:20.749
I don't appease.

14:20.849 --> 14:22.030
I don't coax and massage

14:22.130 --> 14:23.792
the way, say,
a therapist might.

14:23.892 --> 14:25.674
I look like I get out
the scented oils

14:25.774 --> 14:27.516
and Dead Can Dance CDs
before I rub your shoulders?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.658
The verbal equivalent. Yeah.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.082
And, uh, I have
something for you

14:33.182 --> 14:35.184
to commemorate
this moment--

14:42.471 --> 14:44.454
Belonged to Leonard Bernstein.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.556
Greatest of the greats.

14:47.557 --> 14:49.659
This is your time, Scoot.

14:49.759 --> 14:50.820
So proud of you.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.922
[chuckles]

14:56.606 --> 15:00.591
I have been preparing for this
opportunity for a long time,

15:00.691 --> 15:03.554
silently, quietly,
in my waking dreams.

15:03.654 --> 15:06.977
But I never knew
it would come to fruition.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.162
Thank you, Mike.

15:11.262 --> 15:14.966
It would be my honour
to share this with you all.

15:15.066 --> 15:16.527
I promise not to disappoint.

15:16.627 --> 15:17.608
Yeah!

15:17.708 --> 15:19.711
[applause]

15:24.115 --> 15:25.377
But for real, though,

15:25.477 --> 15:27.178
your job here,
if we boil it down,

15:27.278 --> 15:29.741
is to make everyone else's life
a little better, right?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.143
Remove the obstacles
in their way.

15:31.243 --> 15:32.504
In a sense.

15:32.604 --> 15:34.306
Today, though,
you made mine worse.

15:34.406 --> 15:36.348
Look, he called me in.

15:36.448 --> 15:38.951
To do the thing that
I do for him. Not you.

15:39.051 --> 15:40.793
'Cause whatever it was
he was getting from you,

15:40.893 --> 15:42.895
it clearly wasn't enough.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.569
If we can connect Eric T.
to the real estate fraud,

15:56.669 --> 15:58.251
maybe he'll roll.

15:58.351 --> 15:59.472
We get big sister up
from Indian Creek Island,

15:59.472 --> 16:00.614
she finally gets
revenge on pops

16:00.714 --> 16:01.514
for ruining her
social standing.

16:01.514 --> 16:03.096
[knock on door]

16:03.196 --> 16:04.538
A second, boss.

16:04.638 --> 16:06.540
One moment, Ms. Torre.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.642
Ira.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.508
- Kid's gone.
- Gambling kid or criminal kid?

16:14.608 --> 16:16.951
- The scammer.
- When you say "gone"?

16:17.051 --> 16:19.954
Got a warrant, entered his place
with the agents. Gone.

16:20.054 --> 16:21.916
Either tipped off
or knew he'd pushed it.

16:22.016 --> 16:23.518
Phone's off, too.

16:23.618 --> 16:24.799
Figure he's gone to ground?

16:24.899 --> 16:26.961
No. Billionaire's kid, you said.

16:27.061 --> 16:29.284
They don't go to ground,
they flee the jurisdiction.

16:29.384 --> 16:31.806
They sure do. Karl...

16:31.906 --> 16:33.688
get Ms. Torre off
whatever she's working on

16:33.788 --> 16:35.290
and onto this,
interfacing with the agents,

16:35.390 --> 16:37.012
checking ships, yachts,

16:37.112 --> 16:38.774
airplane manifests, all of it.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.535
Ground the family crafts.

16:40.635 --> 16:42.337
If Elon Musk is
prototyping jet suits,

16:42.437 --> 16:45.000
find out if our guy's
flying one of those back home.

16:48.123 --> 16:50.125
Come on.

16:52.368 --> 16:55.671
When you try to drip poison
in someone's mouth,

16:55.771 --> 16:58.274
he may turn his head.

16:58.374 --> 17:00.937
And then a clean kill
can turn very messy.

17:02.618 --> 17:04.521
And before long,
you have Dan Aykroyd

17:04.621 --> 17:06.563
double barreling
semi-automatics at your face.

17:06.663 --> 17:09.806
Ah, yes.
Uh, <i>Grosse Pointe Blank.</i>

17:09.906 --> 17:12.329
You know, from treating
all your colleagues--

17:12.429 --> 17:14.371
and I can say this without
breaking confidence,

17:14.471 --> 17:16.693
since that is what brought you
to me in the first place--

17:16.793 --> 17:20.097
I have gotten to revisit
so many fine films.

17:20.197 --> 17:22.259
This one I missed
first time around,

17:22.359 --> 17:24.141
but I enjoyed it.

17:24.241 --> 17:28.386
Even if its commentary
on ambition in the work force

17:28.486 --> 17:30.828
is a bit heavy handed.

17:30.928 --> 17:32.750
I mean, even Shakespeare
laid it on a bit thick

17:32.850 --> 17:34.112
when he was really
trying to make a point.

17:34.212 --> 17:35.593
Still effective.

17:35.693 --> 17:37.916
which play comes to mind?
Answer quickly.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.919
Um, <i>Richard III.</i>

17:41.019 --> 17:45.644
Another work about
an assassin of sorts.

17:45.744 --> 17:47.405
I'm sensing a theme.

17:47.505 --> 17:49.948
Yes. Now that I said it...

17:52.591 --> 17:54.593
ah, you asked on purpose to s--

17:55.594 --> 17:57.016
That's good.

17:57.116 --> 18:00.739
Yes, now that I said it,
I do feel a bit like...

18:00.839 --> 18:03.262
Richard these days,
if more justifiably motivated.

18:03.362 --> 18:06.465
The real Richard was
in quite the tough spot.

18:06.565 --> 18:10.269
His family would have lost
the throne if he didn't act.

18:10.369 --> 18:12.612
Well, that's the question
one asks oneself, isn't it?

18:14.614 --> 18:18.238
If the damage, intended
or collateral, is justified--

18:18.338 --> 18:20.640
or even when
you know it is justified,

18:20.740 --> 18:22.682
if you can live with
the collateral damage.

18:22.782 --> 18:26.326
Change the "you" to "I"
when using examples.

18:26.426 --> 18:29.049
It's difficult to do,
but try it.

18:29.149 --> 18:32.733
I have to do some things.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.796
I am doing some things
that I deem...

18:36.917 --> 18:38.919
necessary.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.063
And these things will help

18:42.163 --> 18:44.625
many, many people.

18:44.725 --> 18:48.189
But they will hurt
some other people.

18:48.289 --> 18:50.291
Fewer.

18:51.453 --> 18:53.995
But the hurt ones are folks
that I know and care about.

18:54.095 --> 18:56.158
So... guilt.

18:56.258 --> 18:57.679
Well, it's strange

18:57.779 --> 18:59.441
because guilt usually
rears up when you--

18:59.541 --> 19:02.444
when I-- do bad things,
things that I know are wrong.

19:02.544 --> 19:04.967
But this is different.
Justified. And yet--

19:05.067 --> 19:08.210
That's why the trolley problem
takes up so many class sessions

19:08.310 --> 19:09.692
when it's taught at Harvard.

19:09.792 --> 19:12.615
We are feeling creatures,

19:12.715 --> 19:15.338
even if it often seems
as though we are not.

19:15.438 --> 19:17.260
So, we know we should only

19:17.360 --> 19:21.064
divert the runaway trolley
if more people will live,

19:21.164 --> 19:24.587
yet we hesitate if we learn
too many nice things

19:24.687 --> 19:27.791
about any one potential victim.

19:27.891 --> 19:30.033
Right. So, how do I execute
what I need to,

19:30.133 --> 19:31.955
all the little moves,

19:32.055 --> 19:33.597
knowing that I'm gonna
do real harm to people

19:33.697 --> 19:35.979
who've done nothing
to earn that fate?

19:37.501 --> 19:40.264
What more can you tell me?
In specific.

19:46.550 --> 19:47.491
You've heard that
Michael Prince

19:47.591 --> 19:49.593
is running for president?

19:50.554 --> 19:52.897
Well, the thing is,
I'm in a position

19:52.997 --> 19:56.461
to really know
what damage he will do--

19:56.561 --> 19:59.544
actually, I know what
his own conscious mind

19:59.644 --> 20:01.947
doesn't know yet about
what damage he will do.

20:02.047 --> 20:03.829
Of course.

20:03.929 --> 20:05.070
It's bad.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.032
For the country.
For the world.

20:07.132 --> 20:08.153
He needs to be stopped.

20:08.253 --> 20:09.314
And I'm one of the few people

20:09.414 --> 20:11.416
who can maybe do the stopping.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.318
But...

20:13.418 --> 20:14.920
to do so requires...

20:15.020 --> 20:17.483
Yeah. The very people
I've promised to help.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.526
And a few people
I've come to really like...

20:20.626 --> 20:22.788
are gonna pay a real price,

20:26.552 --> 20:28.674
Some of them
are my other patients.

20:29.676 --> 20:31.678
Yes.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.263
Then... [clears throat]
...for ethical reasons,

20:36.363 --> 20:38.365
we'll need to stop here.

20:41.047 --> 20:43.871
You asked me the questions
that brought us here.

20:43.971 --> 20:45.672
I mean, you practically
challenged me

20:45.772 --> 20:47.074
to sit here with you,

20:47.174 --> 20:48.515
and now you're
going to abandon me?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.397
You wrestling with
your ethical dilemma

20:50.497 --> 20:53.701
is not a reason for me
to create one of my own.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.245
I'm sorry,

20:57.345 --> 20:59.347
but this is the end
of our session.

21:19.207 --> 21:20.469
We found Kai Huang Liu's name

21:20.569 --> 21:21.870
on a private jet manifest.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.792
Shit. Did it take off?

21:23.892 --> 21:25.314
It did.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.436
And yet a slight
Russell Ziskey smile

21:27.536 --> 21:28.597
dances around your face, Karl.

21:28.697 --> 21:31.240
Because I know
whose jet it is.

21:31.340 --> 21:33.563
And when you find out,
you, too,

21:33.663 --> 21:36.285
will get your Ziskey on.

21:36.385 --> 21:38.047
Ready for it.

21:38.147 --> 21:40.630
Kai Huang Liu is on
one of Michael Prince's jets.

21:41.711 --> 21:43.253
Prince lent our perp his plane?

21:43.353 --> 21:45.055
Accessory after the fact.

21:45.155 --> 21:47.177
- At least.
- Where's the plane now?

21:47.277 --> 21:48.378
Still in U.S. airspace,
but we can assume

21:48.478 --> 21:49.379
they're headed to Taipei.

21:49.479 --> 21:50.821
Don't assume. Find out.

21:50.921 --> 21:52.823
I've got a guy at the FAA.

21:52.923 --> 21:54.705
He can update us with
nav reports every half hour.

21:54.805 --> 21:56.627
Hm, not good enough.

21:56.727 --> 22:00.671
I have to know how far they can
get without needing to refuel.

22:00.771 --> 22:04.475
And background on the pilot.
Maybe he'll cooperate.

22:04.575 --> 22:06.597
Prince is gonna deny any
prior knowledge of wrongdoing.

22:06.697 --> 22:09.160
We'll worry about that
when we get the kid in custody.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.562
Prince has a federal fugitive
on his plane.

22:11.662 --> 22:13.845
We have him in violation
of 181071.

22:13.945 --> 22:16.087
First, let's indict Liu.

22:16.187 --> 22:18.049
Warrant's still in effect,
but we can't serve it

22:18.149 --> 22:19.691
when the perp
is 30,000 feet up.

22:19.791 --> 22:21.893
Can we scramble fighter jets
and bring them down?

22:21.993 --> 22:23.895
[scoffs]
Whoa, Chuck.

22:23.995 --> 22:26.138
I know you mean
force the plane to land.

22:26.238 --> 22:28.240
[chuckles] Do I?

22:29.922 --> 22:32.805
Yes, for the record, I do.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.188
[Chuck sighs]

22:36.288 --> 22:38.911
Okay, uh...

22:39.011 --> 22:40.393
Start by alerting the FAA

22:40.493 --> 22:42.034
we have a warrant
for Liu's arrest.

22:42.134 --> 22:44.237
They'll notify the pilot
of a mandatory return

22:44.337 --> 22:45.638
to his point of departure.

22:45.738 --> 22:47.800
I say wait until they land.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.643
Taiwan is highly cooperative
in extraditing to the U.S.

22:50.743 --> 22:54.207
They'll send him back, we'll
hold him in jail, pending trial.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.889
Put a lot of pressure
on everyone.

22:55.989 --> 22:57.931
I don't want to involve
international authorities.

22:58.031 --> 23:00.574
Opens political avenues
outside my control,

23:00.674 --> 23:03.377
gives Prince too much room
to insulate himself.

23:03.477 --> 23:04.978
[Amanda]
Are you sure, sir?

23:05.078 --> 23:06.700
Once that plane
leaves our airspace,

23:06.800 --> 23:08.202
it expands the menu of charges
we can hit Prince with

23:08.202 --> 23:10.504
- from a hot-dog cart to Denny's.
- No.

23:10.604 --> 23:12.026
Let's not make this
too elaborate.

23:12.126 --> 23:13.467
Simple story is best.

23:13.567 --> 23:14.629
Okay.

23:14.729 --> 23:16.511
I guess I get that.

23:16.611 --> 23:17.872
My self-defence teacher
always says don't go

23:17.972 --> 23:19.354
for the back-spinning
heel kick

23:19.454 --> 23:21.456
when you can just
knee him in the sack.

23:22.497 --> 23:24.038
Quite so.

23:24.138 --> 23:25.880
You need to
ground your plane, Mike.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.042
FAA just reached out.

23:27.142 --> 23:28.363
Which one? And why?

23:28.463 --> 23:30.205
The Bombardier.

23:30.305 --> 23:31.807
who has the Bombardier
in the air right now?

23:31.907 --> 23:33.328
Mr. Liu's chief of staff called

23:33.428 --> 23:34.770
and asked for
a flight to Taiwan.

23:34.870 --> 23:35.891
His plane had
a mechanical issue.

23:35.991 --> 23:37.452
We offered the courtesy.

23:37.552 --> 23:39.615
The courtesy? I mean,
my friends and I ask

23:39.715 --> 23:41.537
when we borrow
each other's cars.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.180
Mr. Liu pays for the gas
and crew when he uses it.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.502
We offer this to him
and a few others like him.

23:46.602 --> 23:47.903
He does the same for us.

23:48.003 --> 23:49.785
Well, that's the what, Kate.
The why?

23:49.885 --> 23:51.507
An arrest warrant was issued
for a passenger on board.

23:51.607 --> 23:53.509
Some kind of a federal offence.

23:53.609 --> 23:55.611
Scooter,
raise the pilot for me.

23:59.135 --> 24:00.717
- [line rings]
- [man] <i>Yes, sir?</i>

24:00.817 --> 24:02.359
Who's in the air with you now?
How many?

24:02.459 --> 24:05.962
<i>Just one passenger.
Male. Liu. 22.</i>

24:06.062 --> 24:08.105
No, Kai's 50.

24:10.027 --> 24:11.448
It's the son.

24:11.548 --> 24:13.210
His office said
it was for dad.

24:13.310 --> 24:14.972
Of course they did.

24:15.072 --> 24:16.233
He must have used the fact
that they have the same name

24:16.233 --> 24:18.315
as a workaround
on the manifest.

24:19.997 --> 24:20.978
Fuel status?

24:21.078 --> 24:22.740
<i>We're at 1900 gallons.</i>

24:22.840 --> 24:24.382
Nine more hours in the air.

24:24.482 --> 24:26.104
<i>Enough to get us to
the Aleutians to refuel.</i>

24:26.204 --> 24:28.346
No, not anymore. Kill
the in-flight monitors first.

24:28.446 --> 24:29.787
Then I want you to fly a loop.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.149
A big one he can hardly feel.

24:31.249 --> 24:32.871
No, no,
don't instruct them to--

24:32.971 --> 24:34.312
You can't, Mike.

24:34.412 --> 24:35.333
Stay within US borders, continental,

24:35.333 --> 24:37.075
and keep a clear margin.

24:37.175 --> 24:38.536
I want you to hold that pattern
until I can figure out

24:38.536 --> 24:40.118
what the frick
is really happening here.

24:40.218 --> 24:41.360
Don't talk to anyone else.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.462
All orders will be direct.

24:48.227 --> 24:50.449
This is Chuck coming after me.

24:50.549 --> 24:53.232
They seem to be keeping
the plane in the air.

24:54.834 --> 24:56.936
[Chuck] Pull in
our contact at the FAA,

24:57.036 --> 24:59.779
get transcripts of all
communication between the pilot

24:59.879 --> 25:01.821
and air traffic,
maybe we can learn something.

25:01.921 --> 25:05.225
By not immediately ordering
his plane to land,

25:05.325 --> 25:07.227
Prince just ticked off
two of the three criteria

25:07.327 --> 25:09.069
for the federal crime
of aiding a fugitive.

25:09.169 --> 25:10.470
Mm-hmm.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.272
Defendant's actions
were intended to prevent

25:12.372 --> 25:14.154
the fugitive's discovery;
and the defendant committed

25:14.254 --> 25:16.036
one or more physical acts--
phone call counts--

25:16.136 --> 25:19.960
to help the fugitive
avoid arrest.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.762
It's close to enough
to indict Prince already.

25:21.862 --> 25:23.764
All right.
Officially indict the kid.

25:23.864 --> 25:27.368
Then, yeah, begin preparing
charges against Prince.

25:27.468 --> 25:29.550
And do it Cannonball Adderley
style--with tempo.

25:31.592 --> 25:33.814
This is a diplomatic
and P.R. disaster.

25:33.914 --> 25:36.417
No, this is a prosecutor
harassing a private citizen.

25:36.517 --> 25:38.259
I am all for fighting,
but once the FAA,

25:38.359 --> 25:40.421
operating on instructions
from the Department of Justice,

25:40.521 --> 25:43.184
orders a plane down,
plane needs to come down.

25:43.284 --> 25:44.626
Then we can defend our position.

25:44.726 --> 25:46.348
If the order is
legitimate to begin with.

25:46.448 --> 25:49.671
Yes. But first, the order
needs to be obeyed.

25:49.771 --> 25:52.834
Aiding a fugitive. That's
what they'll whack you with.

25:52.934 --> 25:54.476
I just lent out my plane.

25:54.576 --> 25:56.578
And it was borrowed
under false pretences.

25:57.699 --> 25:59.041
If it doesn't stick in court,

25:59.141 --> 26:01.123
it will in the papers.
Like pine tar.

26:01.223 --> 26:03.526
Might stick in court, too.

26:03.626 --> 26:05.648
Let's get the plane to ground,

26:05.748 --> 26:07.370
hand over the kid.
Simple as it gets.

26:07.470 --> 26:08.771
Nothing's ever that simple.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.693
Mike and Liu are not just
"in business."

26:10.793 --> 26:12.335
They've made
billions together,

26:12.435 --> 26:14.217
with agreements that will
make billions more.

26:14.317 --> 26:16.579
Plus, we're friends.
Trading partners.

26:16.679 --> 26:18.822
And if I hose my trading partner
in the way you're suggesting,

26:18.922 --> 26:21.304
no one will ever want to do
business with me again.

26:21.404 --> 26:23.266
Also, it won't look good
to the business types

26:23.366 --> 26:24.748
whose votes we're courting.

26:24.848 --> 26:26.269
Well, this is a big, hairy

26:26.369 --> 26:27.991
ball-aching problem.

26:28.091 --> 26:29.873
Is that an official
political term?

26:29.973 --> 26:32.516
Paints a more vivid picture
than "international incident."

26:32.616 --> 26:34.438
[scoffs]

26:34.538 --> 26:37.681
I'm in the process of taking
over the national stage,

26:37.781 --> 26:40.004
and while I didn't get here
by folding to the first flunky

26:40.104 --> 26:41.686
that gave me an order,

26:41.786 --> 26:43.688
I suppose I can try to work
within the parameters.

26:43.788 --> 26:46.170
Kate, can you get somewhere
with Chuck directly?

26:46.270 --> 26:47.972
Go to him as though
we're complying,

26:48.072 --> 26:50.135
see if there's any way
we can get the focus off of us.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.016
Eh, worth a shot.

26:52.116 --> 26:54.519
I'll at least get our point
of view on the record with him.

26:57.442 --> 27:00.185
Still no official category
designation as of now

27:00.285 --> 27:02.067
but at this point,
all signs are pointing

27:02.167 --> 27:03.709
to a Category Five.

27:03.809 --> 27:04.850
So, we're all just gonna
sit here and watch

27:04.850 --> 27:06.792
our comp plummet
by a third?

27:06.892 --> 27:09.074
Yeah, if it's rated Cat Five,
it's gonna be worse than that.

27:09.174 --> 27:12.198
Southern Property & Casualty's
about to make us her bitch.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.240
Last Cat Five was years ago.

27:14.340 --> 27:16.242
They may not wanna
scare the public.

27:16.342 --> 27:18.004
They don't get to decide.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.565
They just report what it is.

27:19.665 --> 27:22.128
Winds were up
to 172 miles per hour.

27:22.228 --> 27:24.811
Rating's empirical.
As you just said,

27:24.911 --> 27:26.653
this quarter's screwed.

27:26.753 --> 27:29.336
Maybe the whole year.

27:29.436 --> 27:31.938
[reporter] <i>Breaking news from
the National Weather Service.</i>

27:32.038 --> 27:33.420
Shh! Shh! Everyone!

27:33.520 --> 27:35.182
<i>Despite recent readings

27:35.282 --> 27:37.344

27:52.420 --> 27:54.682
[reporter continues low]

27:54.782 --> 27:56.404
I almost had a panic attack.

27:56.504 --> 27:57.886
I thought I heard wheezing.

27:57.986 --> 27:59.567
Pay up, DB!

27:59.667 --> 28:02.090
That's ten Gs from you to me.

28:02.190 --> 28:04.192
You don't have Zelle

28:05.994 --> 28:08.136
Check your account.
It's already there.

28:08.236 --> 28:09.498
Nice. Thanks, Bill.

28:09.598 --> 28:12.301
Don't-- Don't thank me.

28:12.401 --> 28:14.503
You won a bet.

28:14.603 --> 28:16.265
Only time I've ever
been happy to lose one.

28:16.365 --> 28:18.948
You got off cheap.
We all did.

28:19.048 --> 28:21.670
Don't wanna think about if the
Cat score went the other way.

28:21.770 --> 28:24.113
Prayers up to Thor, Zeus,

28:24.213 --> 28:26.035
and of course, Oh Mighty Isis:

28:26.135 --> 28:29.439
Thank you for getting
Southern Property & Casualty

28:29.539 --> 28:31.040
off the hook.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.303
Is that who you're
chalking it up to?

28:34.664 --> 28:36.566
Huh. Fascinating.

28:36.666 --> 28:38.668
♪ ♪ ♪

28:47.117 --> 28:49.119
You knew.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.462
I know many things.

28:51.562 --> 28:53.304
The delicate smell of
a Manzanilla sherry

28:53.404 --> 28:54.665
cask whiskey.

28:54.765 --> 28:57.228
What a point-six
waist to hip ratio

28:57.328 --> 28:59.390
looks like from
fifteen yards away.

28:59.490 --> 29:03.034
The exact years Susan Anton
was partial to moustaches.

29:03.134 --> 29:04.716
"Ass end of it," you said.

29:04.816 --> 29:07.118
And our catastrophe bonds
are now suddenly safe.

29:07.218 --> 29:09.561
Like that warden
in <i>Shawshank</i> said,

29:09.661 --> 29:11.563
"It's a miracle.
Praise the Lord."

29:11.663 --> 29:13.004
Only he said it sarcastically

29:13.104 --> 29:14.526
because he knew
it was no miracle

29:14.626 --> 29:16.248
the prisoner had
disappeared from his cell.

29:16.348 --> 29:18.130
That it was a secret,
calculated effort.

29:18.230 --> 29:22.054
Andy Dufresne's escape
was a meticulously planned,

29:22.154 --> 29:26.158
very-difficult-to-work-out,
very smart operation.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.142
How did you know?

29:30.242 --> 29:31.864
I saw the issue coming,

29:31.964 --> 29:34.627
so I took steps as I saw fit

29:34.727 --> 29:36.429
for the benefit
of the enterprise.

29:36.529 --> 29:38.031
What steps could
possibly change

29:38.131 --> 29:39.272
the climatological reality

29:39.372 --> 29:41.374
of an in-process
hurricane?

29:44.017 --> 29:45.238
It's all in your core.

29:45.338 --> 29:46.960
- All right, just keep...
- All right, bye.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.802
Hey, babe!

29:48.902 --> 29:50.684
You never visit me at the gym.

29:50.784 --> 29:52.326
Never even go to the gym.

29:52.426 --> 29:54.368
I missed you so much
I had to come to this

29:54.468 --> 29:57.050
godforsaken land of musk
and grotesque effort

29:57.150 --> 29:59.153
- to see you.
- [chuckles]

30:00.234 --> 30:01.815
Whoa, that's Roker!

30:01.915 --> 30:03.177
[instructor]
Yeah, that was great, man.

30:03.277 --> 30:04.899
- Mr. Roker.
- Yeah.

30:04.999 --> 30:06.821
I had forgotten you shared
this hour with Chelz.

30:06.921 --> 30:08.903
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, Wagster.

30:09.003 --> 30:10.224
You want to work in?

30:10.324 --> 30:11.586
No, I never sweat
before bedtime.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.227
[chuckles]
Look, Al, I need you

30:13.327 --> 30:15.990
to enlighten me
on all things hurricane.

30:16.090 --> 30:17.192
Okay, hit me.

30:17.292 --> 30:19.474
How exactly do they get rated?

30:19.574 --> 30:22.397
Wags, this is
a multi-agency process.

30:22.497 --> 30:23.959
You've got
the National Weather Service,

30:24.059 --> 30:25.921
you've got
the National Oceanic

30:26.021 --> 30:28.724
and Atmospheric Administration,
you've even got the Air Force!

30:28.824 --> 30:31.366
They fly these special planes
called Hurricane Hunters,

30:31.466 --> 30:32.928
right into the storm.

30:33.028 --> 30:34.530
They take real-time data,

30:34.630 --> 30:36.732
relay it back to
the National Hurricane Center.

30:36.832 --> 30:38.534
It's there,
they crunch the numbers

30:38.634 --> 30:40.656
and come up with
a hurricane's category.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.259
So, it's a person
who makes the actual call.

30:43.359 --> 30:45.361
Exactly.

30:46.362 --> 30:47.704
Fantastic.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.505
See?

30:49.605 --> 30:52.228
While science may be empirical,

30:52.328 --> 30:54.030
bureaucracy is not.

30:54.130 --> 30:56.913
And anywhere
human error is in effect,

30:57.013 --> 30:58.715
well, that's where I get busy.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.717
You paid off
the hurricane grader.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.039
She's a woman of science,

31:02.139 --> 31:03.520
who happens to be set up with

31:03.620 --> 31:05.002
quite a charitable
research grant

31:05.102 --> 31:06.363
when she retires next year.

31:06.463 --> 31:10.227
[Prince] Get him now!

31:11.508 --> 31:13.511
Now!

31:16.394 --> 31:17.575
He wants to see you.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.717
Now, I'm guessing?

31:21.879 --> 31:23.661
If I asked you to guess
at what my priorities are,

31:23.761 --> 31:24.903
how would
you enumerate them?

31:25.003 --> 31:26.624
Your daughters first.
Then--

31:26.724 --> 31:28.186
Don't muck around.
Besides family.

31:28.286 --> 31:30.228
You want me to say
the presidency.

31:30.328 --> 31:31.910
I'm already fighting
my butt off

31:32.010 --> 31:34.393
so some BS aviation scandal
doesn't knock me out.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.034
I never thought the bigger
threat would come from--

31:36.134 --> 31:37.916
Inside the house. Sure.
Not what's happening.

31:38.016 --> 31:39.678
Do you think before you act?

31:39.778 --> 31:41.360
Are you capable of that?

31:41.460 --> 31:43.282
Depends what's in my system.
But usually, yes.

31:43.382 --> 31:46.645
Wrong answer. Impulsivity
would at least be an excuse.

31:46.745 --> 31:48.127
Okay. Let's go with that, then.

31:48.227 --> 31:51.370
But let's stipulate that
my mélange of foresight

31:51.470 --> 31:53.052
and impulsivity is precisely why

31:53.152 --> 31:55.375
I am bespoke for my role here.

31:55.475 --> 31:57.457
I think fast, act faster.

31:57.557 --> 32:00.100
You don't get a special pass
for being who you are.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.182
This isn't like extra time
on your ACT.

32:02.282 --> 32:03.984
I took the SAT like a real man.

32:04.084 --> 32:05.305
I didn't need to make excuses

32:05.405 --> 32:06.546
for myself then,
and I won't now.

32:06.646 --> 32:08.709
Wags, change gears.

32:08.809 --> 32:10.751
They feel there's reason
to fire you for cause.

32:10.851 --> 32:12.072
He's going to fire me
for single-handedly

32:12.172 --> 32:13.474
saving him from losing

32:13.574 --> 32:16.196
the gross domestic product
of Bhutan?

32:16.296 --> 32:17.878
No, because you only had
enough theory of mind

32:17.978 --> 32:20.881
to consider one
small facet of the issue.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.764
It doesn't take a Kasparov
to see the problem you caused.

32:23.864 --> 32:25.646
Thousands of people's homes
just got blown away.

32:25.746 --> 32:27.728
Southern Casualty is up
to its neck in claims,

32:27.828 --> 32:29.570
and Mike's bonds are pristine.

32:29.670 --> 32:31.332
The press will paint him
as a Wall Street scammer

32:31.432 --> 32:34.415
who protected his money at
the expense of citizens in need.

32:34.515 --> 32:37.819
If anyone finds out what you've
done, my run is G.D. over!

32:37.919 --> 32:39.301
But if those bonds
were triggered,

32:39.401 --> 32:41.543
it would have reduced
the floor and fund

32:41.643 --> 32:43.345
to stringy, bloody carnage.

32:43.445 --> 32:46.188
We were facing an Act of God.
I responded in kind!

32:46.288 --> 32:47.790
[Luke]
You think you're a god,

32:47.890 --> 32:49.191
but you caused
a domestic crisis

32:49.291 --> 32:50.873
on top of our
international crisis

32:50.973 --> 32:52.595
and upcoming cultural crisis.

32:52.695 --> 32:54.557
You're a fucking liability.

32:54.657 --> 32:56.799
Thus spoke the politician.

32:56.899 --> 32:58.401
But I'm a businessman!

32:58.501 --> 32:59.842
Money is politics.
Especially mine.

32:59.942 --> 33:01.444
You work for both now.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.045
Then I should have
been told what the shot was.

33:03.145 --> 33:05.388
You shouldn't have to be told.

33:07.790 --> 33:10.373
What's bad for the campaign
is bad for MPC.

33:10.473 --> 33:12.896
And me.
Hurting one hurts all.

33:12.996 --> 33:15.859
Okay.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.382
it's true that now,
by the light of day,

33:18.482 --> 33:21.064
I get that there might
have been a corner or two

33:21.164 --> 33:23.166
I didn't see completely around.

33:24.648 --> 33:26.430
Good. I think we can all agree

33:26.530 --> 33:29.133
that accepting blame for this
and growing from it is change.

33:30.214 --> 33:32.216
That's good for everyone.

33:37.221 --> 33:39.464
Yes. No doubt.

33:40.465 --> 33:42.467
My bad.

33:43.948 --> 33:45.950
I know you know
I was trying to help.

33:47.912 --> 33:50.055
I suppose I actually do.

33:50.155 --> 33:52.157
We all do.

33:52.998 --> 33:55.520
Good. And now I will
get back to it.

34:11.137 --> 34:13.139
[clears throat]

34:21.548 --> 34:23.850
You know, I was just wondering
why you had them call me

34:23.950 --> 34:25.292
to ground the plane
instead of having

34:25.392 --> 34:26.693
the FAA call
the pilot direct.

34:26.793 --> 34:28.575
Well, I was doing you
the courtesy,

34:28.675 --> 34:30.337
before making an incident
out of it.

34:30.437 --> 34:31.979
No, you knew you could
embarrass Prince

34:32.079 --> 34:33.540
just by having
his plane turn around.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.022
But instead,
you took the bigger shot,

34:35.122 --> 34:36.503
hoping that
he'd defy your order--

34:36.603 --> 34:38.305
that Prince himself would. But...

34:38.405 --> 34:40.948
'Course, Prince would never defy
an order like that.

34:41.048 --> 34:42.950
Yet the plane still flies.

34:43.050 --> 34:45.233
Just a holding pattern.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.235
There's a hurricane ripping
through the Eastern Seaboard,

34:47.335 --> 34:49.677
in case you hadn't noticed.
Flight paths are a mess,

34:49.777 --> 34:51.239
which is why he merely
instructed the pilot

34:51.339 --> 34:53.321
to stay in the air
until it was safe...

34:53.421 --> 34:55.423
to return.

34:57.385 --> 34:59.387
Follow me, Ms. Sacker.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.231
Come on.

35:08.797 --> 35:10.539
Ira, where are we
with the charges?

35:10.639 --> 35:12.061
Full steam ahead.

35:12.161 --> 35:13.542
Preconditions for the crimes
have been met.

35:13.642 --> 35:15.144
No, you didn't walk me
in here for this.

35:15.244 --> 35:17.246
You walked me
in here to see that.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.711
I could say I'd
forgotten it was up.

35:21.811 --> 35:23.152
Chuck.

35:23.252 --> 35:24.874
You used to run
a tight enough office

35:24.974 --> 35:26.336
that your murder boards
were covered when visitors

35:26.336 --> 35:27.477
were anywhere in the building.

35:27.577 --> 35:29.079
I run a transparent shop now.

35:29.179 --> 35:31.481
- So, no need.
- Hm.

35:31.581 --> 35:33.043
Did you want me
to walk you through

35:33.143 --> 35:34.725
why every one of these
leads on Mike Prince

35:34.825 --> 35:36.767
- is a dead end, or...?
- Nah, save us both the time.

35:36.867 --> 35:38.729
What you need to know is this:

35:38.829 --> 35:41.091
we're not merely watching
and waiting to pounce.

35:41.191 --> 35:42.773
We're gonna tell you
what we're gonna do,

35:42.873 --> 35:44.174
and then we're gonna do it.

35:44.274 --> 35:46.457
No stealth needed,
especially in this case,

35:46.557 --> 35:48.659
because Kai Huang Liu
is a fugitive.

35:48.759 --> 35:51.342
And he's on your guy's plane
instead of in my custody

35:51.442 --> 35:53.144
because he's
a billionaire's buddy.

35:53.244 --> 35:56.027
Hm. You can't arrest people
for having family friends.

35:56.127 --> 35:58.269
If you could, your father's
connections would've had you

35:58.369 --> 36:00.512
locked up before
your career even started.

36:00.612 --> 36:03.114
Enjoying the privilege of
our fathers is something you,

36:03.214 --> 36:05.797
I, and Liu the younger
all share.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.120
What sets us apart from him

36:08.220 --> 36:10.762
is we haven't committed
crimes under the assumption

36:10.862 --> 36:12.124
that our father's
wealthy cronies

36:12.224 --> 36:14.226
are gonna help us
get away with it.

36:16.148 --> 36:17.930
No jury's gonna be
sympathetic to a rich kid

36:18.030 --> 36:20.653
pulling an NFT scam,
not these days.

36:20.753 --> 36:23.175
Neither will they be
sympathetic to Prince

36:23.275 --> 36:26.219
colluding to help that
progeny avoid justice.

36:26.319 --> 36:28.821
Except no jury's ever
gonna hear this case

36:28.921 --> 36:31.544
because you can't prove that
my client had prior knowledge

36:31.644 --> 36:34.267
of Mr. Liu's wrongdoing,
because he had none.

36:34.367 --> 36:37.030
Let alone prove that Prince knew
of your perp's intent to flee,

36:37.130 --> 36:38.591
because he didn't.

36:38.691 --> 36:42.195
You spin faster than
a Barry Zito curveball,

36:42.295 --> 36:44.758
but that won't matter
once we get Liu back.

36:44.858 --> 36:47.160
I don't need to.
I have unassailable evidence:

36:47.260 --> 36:49.283
A decade of my client
and Liu Senior

36:49.383 --> 36:50.924
borrowing each other's
planes as needed

36:51.024 --> 36:52.526
without direct prior contact,

36:52.626 --> 36:54.969
and Prince's complete phone
and email records

36:55.069 --> 36:56.731
from the last 48 hours

36:56.831 --> 36:59.013
proving he had no knowledge of
the incident before it occurred,

36:59.113 --> 37:00.815
all of which we will
provide voluntarily.

37:00.915 --> 37:02.657
No subpoena necessary.

37:02.757 --> 37:04.338
Hm.

37:04.438 --> 37:06.180
So, what are you offering?

37:06.280 --> 37:09.264
Nothing. Prince will either
land that jet now,

37:09.364 --> 37:10.945
or he will go down

37:11.045 --> 37:13.788
like the Rosenbergs
in the press.

37:13.888 --> 37:15.270
Or as Aldrich Ames,
for anybody

37:15.370 --> 37:17.632
who can't remember
the Rosenbergs.

37:17.732 --> 37:19.715
And for those who can't
remember Aldrich Ames?

37:19.815 --> 37:21.396
As a fucking traitor.

37:21.496 --> 37:23.318
Oh, you're right,
you are transparent now.

37:23.418 --> 37:24.840
Go run back and tell him.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.362
Let me know what he says.

37:26.462 --> 37:28.464
Unless he has the gristle
to face me himself.

37:37.033 --> 37:39.035
[door closes]

37:47.764 --> 37:50.307
Lot of good feeling down there
about the hurricane situation,

37:50.407 --> 37:53.710
though I imagine it
played differently up here.

37:53.810 --> 37:55.352
Of course you do.

37:55.452 --> 37:57.434
I remember your mother
telling me that you taught

37:57.534 --> 38:00.517
the members of your chess club
how to play poker

38:00.617 --> 38:01.919
in, what, sixth grade?

38:02.019 --> 38:03.601
So that by the time
they were in high school

38:03.701 --> 38:04.962
and had some spending money,

38:05.062 --> 38:06.964
they'd be ready
to lose it to you.

38:07.064 --> 38:09.447
Sometimes you see the way
a game should be played.

38:09.547 --> 38:12.009
And the B-side to that is by
the time I was in 11th grade,

38:12.109 --> 38:13.811
I'd decided to save
the money I'd won

38:13.911 --> 38:15.413
and throw them all a party--
all of us--

38:15.513 --> 38:16.935
at the end of senior year

38:17.035 --> 38:18.817
because I felt bad
about taking the money.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.739
Because you wanted them to know
that you could have kept it

38:20.839 --> 38:24.222
but chose to give it back
in high style.

38:24.322 --> 38:27.346
No surprise you understand both
sides of the insurance problem.

38:27.446 --> 38:29.988
But I came up here
for a different reason.

38:30.088 --> 38:32.070
To tell you that
you are doing something

38:32.170 --> 38:34.173
that I did not see coming.

38:35.094 --> 38:37.316
Conducting, man!

38:37.416 --> 38:39.438
I'm so psyched about it.
I told Mom.

38:39.538 --> 38:41.961
She told the rest of the fam.
They're all gonna come.

38:42.061 --> 38:43.963
I'm flying 'em in.

38:44.063 --> 38:45.845
I'll defray the cost of that.

38:45.945 --> 38:48.408
No way. I want to do it.

38:48.508 --> 38:50.209
Since Prince already
gave you the baton,

38:50.309 --> 38:51.291
let me make this gift to you.

38:51.391 --> 38:53.393
Man, that baton.

38:54.634 --> 38:56.636
Such a moving gesture.

39:07.888 --> 39:12.593
But also-- and I can only
admit this to family--

39:12.693 --> 39:15.116
my throat went dry
when I saw it.

39:15.216 --> 39:16.958
- My palms were slick.
- That's good.

39:17.058 --> 39:19.060
When was the last time
you were nervous?

39:20.701 --> 39:24.245
Been a long time since something
mattered this much to me.

39:24.345 --> 39:25.727
And to me alone.

39:25.827 --> 39:29.170
I figured. And I'm
happy about it for you.

39:29.270 --> 39:30.892
Yeah.

39:30.992 --> 39:32.994
I am, too.

39:45.928 --> 39:47.930
You see this shit?

39:50.012 --> 39:52.355
If you don't know this is
a disaster, you need lessons.

39:52.455 --> 39:54.837
Everything with you people
is a disaster.

39:54.937 --> 39:56.719
Or a make-or-break moment.

39:56.819 --> 40:00.583
Just lumping me in with every
other politico like that, huh?

40:01.824 --> 40:03.366
What distinguishes you?

40:03.466 --> 40:05.408
There's a question
you should have asked before

40:05.508 --> 40:07.210
just deciding
where to classify me.

40:07.310 --> 40:09.372
I would think before you
therapies someone,

40:09.472 --> 40:11.254
you do an intake, right?

40:11.354 --> 40:13.377
Well, that's also what human
beings do when we meet someone,

40:13.477 --> 40:15.479
so we see them beyond
just their profession.

40:16.560 --> 40:18.542
Do your job.

40:18.642 --> 40:21.305
see Prince through the Taiwan
thing and the hurricane mess.

40:21.405 --> 40:24.789
Then, if you're still here,

40:24.889 --> 40:26.891
maybe I'll take the time.

40:40.665 --> 40:41.927
I-I don't want to
sit in that chair

40:42.027 --> 40:43.288
only to have to leave again

40:43.388 --> 40:44.409
before we get anything done.

40:44.509 --> 40:46.091
I came because you texted.

40:46.191 --> 40:47.452
Out of respect.

40:47.552 --> 40:49.795
And maybe to formally
say goodbye.

40:52.878 --> 40:54.880
I understand.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.424
You know,
if you asked me to tell you

40:58.524 --> 41:00.947
the most challenging
work of my career,

41:01.047 --> 41:04.510
it might have been when I was
treating an Army chaplain.

41:04.610 --> 41:06.913
This man counselled officers

41:07.013 --> 41:10.036
who sent men to die in battle.

41:10.136 --> 41:13.400
His work centred around
removing their guilt.

41:13.500 --> 41:18.004
And as a result,
he took it all on himself.

41:18.104 --> 41:22.689
And he had found that
his prayers and devotion

41:22.789 --> 41:25.132
were no longer alleviating it.

41:25.232 --> 41:29.016
You were able to release him
from that burden?

41:29.116 --> 41:32.860
After five sessions with me,

41:32.960 --> 41:35.222
he quit the Army and the Church.

41:35.322 --> 41:36.864
He became a woodworker.

41:36.964 --> 41:40.788
Because he and I agreed
that in his case,

41:40.888 --> 41:42.911
he wasn't really needed.

41:43.011 --> 41:46.114
There were people
who could fill that role

41:46.214 --> 41:50.038
more effectively
than he at that time.

41:50.138 --> 41:54.803
True believers
who didn't harbour doubts.

41:54.903 --> 41:58.046
So, you think someone else can
stop what I'm trying to stop?

41:58.146 --> 42:00.149
No.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.771
But I do think
there are plenty of good,

42:02.871 --> 42:04.653
well-trained psychiatrists

42:04.753 --> 42:07.676
who can help your colleagues in
the way I was helping them.

42:09.198 --> 42:11.100
So, I have referred them out.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.202
Each and every one.

42:15.565 --> 42:16.906
And now...

42:17.006 --> 42:19.309
there is no conflict in doing

42:19.409 --> 42:22.612
this vitally important
work with you.

42:27.898 --> 42:29.680
Thank you.

42:29.780 --> 42:32.382
I understand the enormity
of that decision.

42:36.867 --> 42:38.369
They're going to lose
a lot seeing someone

42:38.469 --> 42:40.931
other than you.

42:41.031 --> 42:44.075
Won't they lose more
if I don't help you succeed?

42:49.480 --> 42:52.944
It's clear that you
are a rational being

42:53.044 --> 42:55.467
and that what you have
determined about Prince

42:55.567 --> 42:57.969
is quite likely the truth.

43:00.292 --> 43:04.116
So, I will help you find a path

43:04.216 --> 43:07.139
to doing what you must.

43:11.103 --> 43:13.345
[exhales]

43:15.788 --> 43:19.392
And yet, all day,
I have felt culpable...

43:21.594 --> 43:23.176
out of sorts.

43:23.276 --> 43:24.657
Anxious, even.

43:24.757 --> 43:28.421
Oh. That's normal
in the circumstances.

43:28.521 --> 43:31.184
Not for me.
I don't get anxious.

43:31.284 --> 43:32.505
When I played college soccer,

43:32.605 --> 43:34.387
I was first up
for penalty kicks in OT.

43:34.487 --> 43:38.832
Because you were willing to
risk failure to help the team.

43:38.932 --> 43:42.156
You were bonded with your team.

43:42.256 --> 43:45.879
Here, your team
is going to get hurt,

43:45.979 --> 43:48.642
financially and in other ways,

43:48.742 --> 43:53.327
as you try to serve
the broader interest.

43:53.427 --> 43:55.590
That's true, yes.

43:58.593 --> 44:01.536
But beyond the team, there's
one person in particular

44:01.636 --> 44:04.099
who's gonna be
collateral damage.

44:04.199 --> 44:05.820
He was never
a patient of yours.

44:05.920 --> 44:09.024
He's the guy Prince brought in
to run the campaign.

44:09.124 --> 44:11.126
I like him.

44:12.127 --> 44:14.429
He's smart and...

44:14.529 --> 44:16.632
committed and engaged and...

44:16.732 --> 44:19.515
on the kind of upward trajectory
few people ever have.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.617
If it weren't for me.

44:24.500 --> 44:28.304
Your face gets a little flushed
as you talk about him.

44:29.986 --> 44:31.988
I believe you.

44:34.070 --> 44:36.533
Well...

44:36.633 --> 44:39.896
you're going to have to make
many choices along the way,

44:39.996 --> 44:41.898
many sacrifices,

44:41.998 --> 44:45.682
if you are going to carry out
your stated mission.

44:47.764 --> 44:51.909
In this room, the mission
will be to keep you aligned,

44:52.009 --> 44:57.034
to allow you to remind yourself
why you are doing it.

44:57.134 --> 45:01.038
And to give you the chance
to say a private prayer

45:01.138 --> 45:05.563
of repentance
for each and every one

45:05.663 --> 45:09.647
of the people you love
who you are going to hurt.

45:09.747 --> 45:11.749
But that's all of them.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.053
As I see it now, if I succeed
in taking Prince out,

45:15.153 --> 45:17.375
I'm gonna have to rough up
each and every person

45:17.475 --> 45:20.058
who works there
at some point along the way.

45:20.158 --> 45:24.143
Then let's start
naming them now.

45:24.243 --> 45:27.586
Feeling the pain,
it will cause you

45:27.686 --> 45:29.688
to cause them pain.

45:30.889 --> 45:32.972
And then, you will release it.

45:34.093 --> 45:36.075
Breathe it out.

45:36.175 --> 45:37.356
And move on.

45:37.456 --> 45:39.458
Okay.

45:40.419 --> 45:42.422
Let's do that.

45:43.543 --> 45:45.645
How about we start
with the gentleman

45:45.745 --> 45:47.607
who is bringing color
to your cheeks?

45:47.707 --> 45:50.510
His name is Bradford Luke.

[indistinct chatter]

46:01.241 --> 46:03.103
Interfering with public use.

46:03.203 --> 46:04.785
Should I add that to the list?

46:04.885 --> 46:07.268
- You want people to hear this?
- I'm an open book.

46:07.368 --> 46:09.630
Unlike you.

46:09.730 --> 46:11.873
What do you need to leave me
out of this, man?

46:11.973 --> 46:14.075
The kid in cuffs
on American soil,

46:14.175 --> 46:16.157
like I told Sacker
and she told you.

46:16.257 --> 46:18.880
Do you want that?
You sort of do, sure.

46:18.980 --> 46:20.882
A guy like you will always take
another feather in his cap.

46:20.982 --> 46:22.644
But do you really
even give a darn?

46:22.744 --> 46:24.846
You think I wear this pin
cynically?

46:24.946 --> 46:26.808
[chuckling]
I know why you wear that pin.

46:26.908 --> 46:28.970
Optics. Pandering.

46:29.070 --> 46:31.213
Nixon popularised the practice,
for God's sake.

46:31.313 --> 46:33.255
It's true. Haldeman saw
Redford wearing one

46:33.355 --> 46:35.297
in <i>The Candidate</i>
and brought the idea back.

46:35.397 --> 46:36.859
Nixon liked it so much,

46:36.959 --> 46:38.340
he had the whole staff

46:38.440 --> 46:40.022
But like so many traditions,

46:40.122 --> 46:41.784
most people don't
know how it started,

46:41.884 --> 46:43.826
and more people don't care.

46:43.926 --> 46:47.750
They only know how it makes
them feel to see it.

46:47.850 --> 46:49.852
And what it stands for.

46:51.174 --> 46:52.635
So, what do you really need?

46:52.735 --> 46:54.737
Withdraw from the race.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.643
Drop your so-called
presidential ambitions,

46:59.743 --> 47:01.284
which are really
just a tarted-up way

47:01.384 --> 47:03.386
of describing
your lust for power.

47:04.267 --> 47:06.009
Go back to your office

47:06.109 --> 47:07.651
and continue with your
standard-issue profiteering,

47:07.751 --> 47:09.573
forget about
steering our nation,

47:09.673 --> 47:11.675
and I'll back off.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.862
You know, I've had
a lot of people

47:17.962 --> 47:20.064
telling me what to do today.

47:20.164 --> 47:22.667
Lot of good advice.
Well-intentioned, anyway.

About how I should
be doing things and why...

47:24.849 --> 47:26.991
how it'll all look.

47:27.091 --> 47:29.434
It'd gotten to the
point where saying "screw it"

47:29.534 --> 47:31.316
and walking away was
starting to look pretty good.

47:31.416 --> 47:32.958
Mm.

47:33.058 --> 47:35.280
But then I remembered...

47:35.380 --> 47:37.282
who the heck I am

47:37.382 --> 47:39.204
and how I got to be that guy.

47:39.304 --> 47:41.406
And it wasn't by following
somebody else's script.

47:41.506 --> 47:44.370
It was by blazing my own path.

47:44.470 --> 47:47.393
A path that leads
to the White House.

47:50.476 --> 47:52.578
So, what I'm gonna do,

53:14.015 --> 53:15.397
to send
the Indiana National Guard

53:15.497 --> 53:17.719
to areas hit hardest
by the hurricane,

53:17.819 --> 53:20.482
since units in the region
are underfunded.

53:20.582 --> 53:22.364
This will get aid
to where it needs to be

53:22.464 --> 53:24.646
before and until
the FEMA funds kick in.

53:24.746 --> 53:26.688
All on Mike's dime.

53:26.788 --> 53:29.091
Foreign affairs settled.
Domestic affairs are settled.

53:29.191 --> 53:31.293
And we're going to help
a whole bunch of people.

53:31.393 --> 53:32.775
Today was a good day.

53:32.875 --> 53:34.657
I am so fucking happy
it worked out.

53:34.757 --> 53:36.258
Now, no matter what happens,

53:36.358 --> 53:37.740
you will be seen to
have done the right thing.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.022
Not merely seen to be, Wags.
Doing it.

53:40.122 --> 53:42.165
Even more reason
to smile about it.

53:46.409 --> 53:48.411
[exhales]

53:52.175 --> 53:53.757
Every single thing you do now

53:53.857 --> 53:56.440
matters in a way
it didn't before.

53:56.540 --> 53:58.121
There are no casual decisions.

53:58.221 --> 54:00.804
And no one borrows your jet.

54:00.904 --> 54:04.088
No one drops by your house for
dinner without prior approval.

54:04.188 --> 54:06.851
No employee makes it look like
you're using a loophole

54:06.951 --> 54:09.734
to avoid paying out
to the victims of a hurricane.

54:09.834 --> 54:10.855
You need to be
the kind of person

54:10.955 --> 54:12.016
who sees a hurricane coming--

54:12.116 --> 54:14.218
Yeah. And runs toward it

54:14.318 --> 54:15.740
with bailing buckets
and blankets

54:15.840 --> 54:16.981
to wrap folks in.

54:17.081 --> 54:19.083
Now you get it.

54:19.724 --> 54:21.866
You need to assume
everything will come out

54:21.966 --> 54:23.308
because it will.

54:23.408 --> 54:25.030
So, take care to handle it
in advance

54:25.130 --> 54:27.132
for the win.

54:28.133 --> 54:30.395
It'll feel overwhelming,
but that's just what every hour

54:30.495 --> 54:32.497
of every day
in the actual job will be.

54:45.911 --> 54:47.913
[sighs]

54:58.525 --> 54:59.586
I can't let you do it.

54:59.686 --> 55:01.708
I know.

55:01.808 --> 55:04.211
I want you to.
You need to know that.

55:06.133 --> 55:08.175
You can keep the baton.
You should.

55:10.137 --> 55:13.881
And, I promise,
after the inauguration,

55:13.981 --> 55:16.083
you'll conduct
the National Orchestra.

55:16.183 --> 55:18.325
Maybe do a full run
up the Eastern Seaboard.

55:18.425 --> 55:20.047
That would be wonderful.

55:20.147 --> 55:22.610
[chuckles] You don't have
to take this so gracefully,

55:22.710 --> 55:24.532
me depriving you
of this dream right now.

55:24.632 --> 55:25.813
You gave it to me.

55:25.913 --> 55:27.815
I really wanted to.

55:27.915 --> 55:29.918
I believe you.

55:30.678 --> 55:32.380
I'm sorry.

55:32.480 --> 55:34.062
This is what
I signed on for.

55:34.162 --> 55:35.704
To make your life easier

55:35.804 --> 55:37.466
so your journey became longer.

55:37.566 --> 55:39.227
Richer. More fulfilling.

55:39.327 --> 55:42.110
And I've always been
rewarded for so doing.

55:42.210 --> 55:45.714
It doesn't change just because
it's in a different arena.

55:45.814 --> 55:47.196
What about your life?

55:47.296 --> 55:49.959
Well, you said you
had a good day today.

55:50.059 --> 55:52.381
- I did.
- Then so did I.

55:58.908 --> 56:00.910
Hold this for me.

56:02.832 --> 56:04.834
Until.

Seemed the only thing to say.

56:53.445 --> 56:55.307
Especially after
I screwed up that bad.

56:55.407 --> 56:57.509
You didn't screw up.
You tried to take him out

56:57.609 --> 57:01.233
by making him look
like an insurance scammer.

57:01.333 --> 57:03.335
Almost succeeded.

57:04.617 --> 57:06.118
Lone gunman-style.

57:06.218 --> 57:08.121
But I guess... fuck.

57:08.221 --> 57:09.762

57:09.862 --> 57:12.825
A clean kill

Don't get yourself fired.

57:27.281 --> 57:29.183
We can't-- none of us--
can do this alone.

57:29.283 --> 57:31.265

I am now. Are you?

Because Prince was right
about your impulsivity.

57:42.336 --> 57:45.800
That shit can't get it
done at these stakes, so...

57:45.900 --> 57:48.002
will you exercise
the discipline required

57:48.102 --> 57:50.165
to really do it right?
