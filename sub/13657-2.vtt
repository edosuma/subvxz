[ police radio chatter ]

00:52.520 --> 00:56.889
[ sea gulls crying ]

00:56.891 --> 00:58.490
Morning.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.125
No caffeine.
I'm on a cleanse.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.226
A what?

01:01.228 --> 01:03.195
Cleanse.
You know, like a diet.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.065
Rid your body of toxins,
lose some weight.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.800
What do you eat?

01:07.802 --> 01:09.768
You don't. You just drink a lot
of this special juice here.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.637
Tastes great.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.172
Look, I got a physical
coming up.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.907
Well...
[ chuckles ]

01:14.909 --> 01:17.543
That's not an exam
that you have to study for.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.744
[ chuckles ]

01:20.146 --> 01:21.613
Never mind.

01:23.116 --> 01:26.018
Sanchez.
Brought you some coffee.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.519
Sanchez: Oh, great.
Thank you, sir.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.654
Yep.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.289
So...

01:30.291 --> 01:32.624
What are we
looking at?

01:32.626 --> 01:36.028
Well, the maid showed up
this morning, like every Monday,

01:36.030 --> 01:39.064
Found two bodies,
and called 911.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.666
No signs
of a break-in,

01:40.668 --> 01:43.001
So murder-suicide,
most likely.

01:43.003 --> 01:47.573
Well, murder-suicide
usually solves <i>itself.</i>

01:47.575 --> 01:49.041
Where's everybody else?

01:49.043 --> 01:51.009
Tao and sykes are upstairs
with the dead shooter,

01:51.011 --> 01:52.144
Who's the homeowner,
sir.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.779
Flynn:
His victim is female,

01:53.781 --> 01:56.115
Shot in the back of the head --
through here.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.816
Yeah.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.686
Are we talking husband/wife,
boyfriend/girlfriend?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.821
Uh, brother and sister,
according to the maid, sir.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.956
The maid?
In here.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.791
Claudia.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.560
She has a key to the house,
and she knows the alarm code.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.329
Which, according
to the alarm company,

02:10.331 --> 02:13.765
Hasn't been set
since, uh...Saturday.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.068
Well, claudia said
that the sister, janet,
had been visiting,

02:16.070 --> 02:17.336
And she argued
with her brother a lot.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.937
What was the fight
over?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.639
<i>¿sabes por qué</i>
<i>estaban peleando?</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:23.075
Creo que estaban peleando
por el esposo de janet.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.744
She thinks it was
about janet's husband...
Pero como mi inglés
<i>no es muy bueno,</i>

02:25.746 --> 02:27.312
But because her english...
<i>Fue difícil</i>
<i>para entender.</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:29.014
Isn't so good, it was difficult
for her to understand.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.718
El señor william nunca
podría hacer algo como esto.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.287
But mr. William would
never do something like this.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.288
Provenza: Ah.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.890
Where's the first body?

02:37.892 --> 02:40.659
Right this way.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.296
Her license says
her name is janet bloom,

02:44.298 --> 02:46.331
31 years old,
from arizona.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.900
And from the looks
of things,

02:47.902 --> 02:50.802
She was moving pretty fast
when he shot her.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.171
See these streaks?

02:52.173 --> 02:54.306
When she hit the floor,
she slid a good 6 inches.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.874
Oh, geez.

02:55.876 --> 02:59.611
Why do I keep putting myself
through this?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.280
Emma: Oh, oh,
lieutenant provenza?

03:01.282 --> 03:02.314
Yes?!

03:02.316 --> 03:03.649
Good morning, lieutenant.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.983
Yeah.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.818
Is it -- is it bad?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.321
Well, I've seen worse.

03:09.323 --> 03:13.158
Anyway, I was just
going upstairs to the suicide.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.726
You're welcome
to join me.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.962
Well -- well,
maybe I should...Look.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.801
[ gasps ]

03:22.803 --> 03:25.003
Her face is missing,
lieutenant!

03:25.005 --> 03:26.305
You said --

03:26.307 --> 03:28.707
I said that I had seen worse,
and I have!

03:28.709 --> 03:29.808
He has.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.411
Emma, if you are
going to continue

03:32.413 --> 03:35.147
To come to the morgue
and to the crime scenes,

03:35.149 --> 03:37.382
You have got to
get used to it.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.986
Uh...Here.
Uh, let me help you.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.354
Ohh,
her face is missing.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.422
This way.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.728
Here.
I got you a coffee.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.830
Seriously?
Thank you.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.665
Mmm.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.334
I didn't have time to stop
on my way in. How did you know?

03:55.336 --> 03:56.802
I'm a detective.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.338
Excuse me, <i>detective.</i>

03:59.340 --> 04:01.940
So, d.D.A. Rios,

04:01.942 --> 04:04.943
Since, um,
since it appears

04:04.945 --> 04:07.746
That we won't need a conviction
in this case,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.881
There is
<i>another</i> potential deal

04:09.883 --> 04:11.950
That I would like
to discuss with you.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.252
Is this
about phillip stroh?

04:13.254 --> 04:16.088
Has the special-circs
committee

04:16.090 --> 04:18.056
Reviewed
your new brief yet?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.259
Lieutenant, I understand
you're concerned

04:20.261 --> 04:21.927
About
our material witness.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.163
If you people don't withdraw
a recommendation for death,

04:25.165 --> 04:26.999
Rusty will be forced
to take the stand,

04:27.001 --> 04:28.967
And he'll have to talk
about stuff that --

04:28.969 --> 04:32.271
That we're trying very hard
to help him forget.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.905
I can't handicap my case

04:33.907 --> 04:35.741
Worrying about how it'll affect
a teenage prostitute.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.977
Not to mention how it will look
to the people of california

04:38.979 --> 04:41.513
If I offer a deal
to a serial killer.

04:42.248 --> 04:44.916
[ gasps ]
oh, god! Oh, god!

04:44.918 --> 04:47.152
Seriously -- seriously! You have
got to keep your voice down.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.956
Now, just stand here --
quietly.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.858
Meet william edwards --

04:52.860 --> 04:56.061
35, single,
and, uh, a <i>big</i> sports fan.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.929
But maybe not
a legal gun owner.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.866
The one that was in his hand
is not registered to him.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.301
Kendall,
time of death?

05:02.303 --> 05:03.802
Both bodies
are coming out of rigor,

05:03.804 --> 05:06.305
So we're looking at
24 to 36 hours.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.774
So Saturday night
or Sunday morning.

05:08.776 --> 05:09.775
Suicide?

05:09.777 --> 05:10.976
Looks right.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.911
The guy shot himself
lying down.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.479
Kinda weird,
but it takes all kinds.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.848
Buzz: Looks like he was doing
pretty well for himself.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.517
Expensive watches,
designer clothes.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.518
A porsche
in the garage.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.053
Find a note?

05:21.055 --> 05:23.322
No, sir.
We're still looking.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.956
Have you checked
the laptops?

05:27.293 --> 05:28.927
Buzz:
They're password-protected,

05:28.929 --> 05:31.129
So it'll take a moment
to figure out their log-ins.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.032
Cracked 'em!

05:34.034 --> 05:36.902
Her middle name,
his birthday.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.236
Pretty run-of-the-mill
stuff.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.940
Um...I'll see
what I can find.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.275
Thank you, mike.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.310
Detective sykes,
you were saying?

05:45.312 --> 05:46.978
Right --
uh, dr. Edwards

05:46.980 --> 05:49.214
Was a cosmetic dentist,
owned his own practice.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.450
Office manager said
he was extremely successful,

05:51.452 --> 05:53.185
And his credit report
backs that up.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.987
According to his facebook page,
he was gay, single,

05:55.989 --> 05:59.291
And his last status update was
"decaf -- what's the point?"

05:59.293 --> 06:01.393
Actually, it's <i>caffeine</i>
<i>we should do without.</i>

06:02.261 --> 06:03.261
It's a drug.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.197
Seriously.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.298
Sharon:
Anyone else think

06:06.300 --> 06:09.334
That it is odd
that dr. Edwards

06:09.336 --> 06:14.072
Had both his <i>and</i> his sister's
laptop in his room?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.540
Well...

06:15.542 --> 06:17.876
Maybe something on janet's
computer started the argument.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.878
Sanchez: Text messages
from edwards' phone

06:19.880 --> 06:21.947
To his sister
about her divorce, ma'am.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.249
[ muffled ] rios,
why are you still here?

06:24.251 --> 06:26.818
Waiting for you guys
to confirm murder-suicide.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.587
And I-I can't find
my keys.

06:28.589 --> 06:32.391
Sharon: These text messages
make it sound like

06:32.393 --> 06:34.559
Janet's husband
was physically abusing her

06:34.561 --> 06:36.561
And that she sought safety
with the brother.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.996
How'd that work out?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.031
Why haven't we put out
a press release,

06:40.033 --> 06:42.234
Tied this murder-suicide up
with a bow?

06:42.236 --> 06:44.069
Because we still have
loose ends.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.170
Like what?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.838
Gun is registered
to someone else.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.306
Provenza:
And our female victim

06:48.308 --> 06:51.176
Was in the middle
of a very messy divorce.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.378
Julio.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.046
I just found
a string of e-mails

06:55.048 --> 06:56.615
Between janet
and her husband.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.350
He was in town this weekend
to try to patch things up.

06:58.352 --> 07:01.520
And get this --
they had plans to eat together

07:01.522 --> 07:03.221
Saturday evening.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.056
Same night
as the murders.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.460
Maybe edwards
got angry with janet

07:08.462 --> 07:10.862
For going out
with her wife-beating husband.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.198
Sharon: So, dr. Edwards
saves his sister

07:13.200 --> 07:16.168
From a bad relationship
by killing her?

07:16.170 --> 07:17.969
Husband wrote janet
an e-mail

07:17.971 --> 07:22.874
Saying he'd be at the ramada
in west hollywood till tomorrow.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.242
If you're not busy...?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.545
Oh, um,
I-I will go look

07:26.547 --> 07:28.413
And check I-if the husband
is still there.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.415
Right.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.384
Loose ends.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.586
They're not the same.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.488
Something wrong?

07:37.924 --> 07:40.058
The pictures of
the victim's house on facebook

07:40.060 --> 07:42.160
Do not sync up with my video
of the crime scene.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.429
Dr. Morales:
Morning, everyone.

07:44.431 --> 07:47.065
Hope you weren't planning
on leaving early today.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.366
Now what?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.068
Your supposed suicide.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.204
William edwards'
left wrist.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.073
You see the small abrasion
on the bone?

07:57.443 --> 07:58.977
There's no blood.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.579
The cut is postmortem.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.113
Correct.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.915
I think the victim's wrists
were restrained

08:03.917 --> 08:06.318
With handcuffs
removed <i>after</i> death,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.453
Which is why
the cut didn't bleed.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.688
But if he was cuffed,

08:09.690 --> 08:11.690
Wouldn't we see bruising
on his wrists?

08:11.692 --> 08:13.091
Not if
the cuffs were padded.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.960
Padded handcuffs?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.228
Or leather restraints.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.496
Maybe he liked it rough
in the bedroom.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.464
Guess edwards forgot
his safe word.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.133
Oh, and I found
at least four cotton fibers

08:22.135 --> 08:23.602
In dr. Edwards' mouth,

08:23.604 --> 08:26.538
So somebody was trying to
keep him quiet before he died.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.441
Ramada says the husband
hasn't checked out yet.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.443
Maybe we should get him
some room service.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.311
Yeah, we'll give him a ride
across town.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.480
Come on, sykes.
You can drive.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.215
Tao: Uh, captain?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.484
Edwards posted a lot of photos
of his house on facebook,

08:39.486 --> 08:41.486
But when buzz
compared these pictures

08:41.488 --> 08:44.289
To the crime-scene video,
they didn't match.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.958
For instance, online,
you can see

08:46.960 --> 08:49.294
Edwards arranged his baseball
collection differently.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.096
Today,
it's all out of order.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.232
And we found his laptop
on his dresser.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.636
All the other pictures,
it's on his desk downstairs.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.738
Laptops are designed
to move around, but --

08:59.740 --> 09:02.974
Maybe we should talk
to that maid again

09:02.976 --> 09:04.576
And show her
those pictures.

09:04.578 --> 09:07.746
Better yet, maybe we should
take her back to the scene.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.481
Captain raydor?

09:09.483 --> 09:12.651
This is a very strange letter
sent to rusty --

09:12.653 --> 09:14.586
Care of dcfs.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.621
Careful
how you take it.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.165
Oh, god.

09:36.175 --> 09:39.044
"I've been following the
phillip stroh case in the news.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.745
"you must be
under a lot of pressure

09:40.747 --> 09:43.682
"as such an important witness
against him.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.318
"on the bright side,
at least you're no longer

09:46.320 --> 09:49.354
"hunting for tricks
on sunset boulevard.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.290

to write this himself.

What the two of you did

We went to dinner.

And she stormed out
before the food came.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.473
And after that?

12:21.475 --> 12:23.475
I found her crying
in the parking lot.

12:23.477 --> 12:26.611
She doesn't want to even sit
at the same table with me.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.813
So I dropped her off
at her brother's place.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.616
That's it.

to call her a few times.

And had patrol
pick you up

28:06.285 --> 28:07.618
And bring you to work
afterwards.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.620
Really?
I mean, really?

28:09.622 --> 28:12.623
Is it not bad enough that I have
to spend all summer in school,

28:12.625 --> 28:15.459
Doing all this extra study work
with buzz?

28:15.461 --> 28:16.860
Which I'm not
complaining about,

28:16.862 --> 28:18.862
Because I know
he's helping me out for free

28:18.864 --> 28:20.664
And is...Mostly nice
about it.

28:20.666 --> 28:21.899
But I just --

28:21.901 --> 28:23.901
I spend so much time
with you guys already.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.869
And what's the point
of my having a car

28:25.871 --> 28:27.171
If you take me
everywhere?

28:27.173 --> 28:28.639
Well, it's just
while we wait

28:28.641 --> 28:31.208
Until the lab results
from the letter come back,

28:31.210 --> 28:32.576
If you don't mind.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.211
Well,
you're asking me,

28:34.213 --> 28:36.480
So it sounds like
I have a choice?

28:36.482 --> 28:39.283
That would be
misleading.

28:41.786 --> 28:43.520
Fine.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.356
Drop me off at school tomorrow
like I'm 7 years old,

28:46.358 --> 28:48.625
And I'll wait
till I see the squad car

28:48.627 --> 28:50.627
Before I walk out the door,
like last year.

28:50.629 --> 28:51.795
Is that the deal?

28:51.797 --> 28:53.564
It   <i>is.</i>

28:53.566 --> 28:55.899
And I thank you
for your understanding.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.435
Okay. Whatever.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.906
Tao: We kept a close eye
on our suspect overnight.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.709
Provenza says mr. Allen drew
a good public defender.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.445
Roland jennings.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.947
Morning.
Morning.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.549
Yeah, I've sat across from him
several times.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.817
Knows what he's doing.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.686
Your searches
turn up anything?

29:15.688 --> 29:18.388
Prescriptions
in tyler allen's apartment

29:18.390 --> 29:20.390
In the names
of the people he robbed.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.426
So, not a genius.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.694
And in his car?

29:23.696 --> 29:25.429
A pair
of padded handcuffs.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.830
Seriously?

29:26.832 --> 29:28.832
Did they have
edwards' blood on them?

29:28.834 --> 29:31.235
Not a trace, but allen
doesn't need to know that.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.669
He's the guy.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.938
And if mr. Jennings
is a decent lawyer,

29:34.940 --> 29:38.809
He'll deal on the four
reported robberies as <i>one</i> crime.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.412
Wait, wait, wait.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.681
These robberies don't include
the one at edwards' house.

29:44.683 --> 29:46.717
If they did include
that one, emma,

29:46.719 --> 29:50.320
Even tyler allen, our suspect,
would know what we're up to.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.655
I want double homicide.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.558
And these other robberies
are the way to get it.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.594
Just deal
as you normally would, please.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.429
I promise you --
we're on the same side.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.430
Come on.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.299
Come on. Let's go.

30:08.740 --> 30:09.740
[ door opens ]

30:09.742 --> 30:11.308
Ah. The ladies.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.343
Um, jennings,
this is d.D.A. Rios.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.912
D.D.A. Rios and I
have met.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.246
Ah.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.982
And, uh,
this is captain raydor.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.918
Uh, so, I was just --
thank you.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
I was just asking
the lieutenant here,

30:22.922 --> 30:25.289
Who -- well, has been
investigating homicides

30:25.291 --> 30:26.857
Since...
Before I was born,

30:26.859 --> 30:30.661
Why major crimes is working
a bunch of no-account robberies.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.330
"no-account robberies"?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.899
Oh, I-I wouldn't
call them that.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.701
Uh...

30:37.703 --> 30:41.471
Your client preyed
exclusively on gay men,

30:41.473 --> 30:44.608
So his offenses could be
looked at as hate crimes.

30:44.610 --> 30:48.011
And due to recent events,
the l.A.P.D. Is...

30:48.013 --> 30:51.615
Extremely sensitive
to accusations of prejudice.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.417
Mm-hmm. Right.
Go on.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.052
In addition
to being gay,

30:55.054 --> 30:57.487
Each one
of the <i>four</i> victims

30:57.489 --> 31:00.524
I.D.'d mr. Allen
as their assailant.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.460
Now, put that with prescriptions
in the victims' name

31:03.462 --> 31:05.929
Ending up in
your client's possession --

31:05.931 --> 31:09.433
Oh, and, uh, the handcuffs
in his trunk...

31:09.435 --> 31:10.868
Okay. Okay.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.904
So, given your evidence
and the potential media heat,

31:13.906 --> 31:15.906
You're willing to deal here
because...?

31:15.908 --> 31:19.076
We want to,
you know...

31:19.078 --> 31:21.678
Spare the victims
from testifying.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.314
Something I wish
we did more of around here.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.083
And what kind of sentence
are you looking for

31:26.085 --> 31:27.451
On these robberies?

31:27.453 --> 31:29.519
Two years each --
consecutive.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.521
That's a little steep,
isn't it?

31:31.523 --> 31:34.458
[ chuckles ]
these robberies sound more like
aggravated burglaries to me.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.560
No one was injured,
no break-ins.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.029
Even if your version of events
is correct,

31:39.031 --> 31:41.331
My client was invited in
by each --

31:41.333 --> 31:43.700
Lucky for him -- otherwise,
we wouldn't be sitting here

31:43.702 --> 31:45.502
Bargaining
over his sentencing.
Oh, the state just let
a lot of people out of prison

31:45.504 --> 31:47.437
Who did much worse things
than this.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.072
Two years apiece,
concurrent.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.741
No.
I said eight years.

31:50.743 --> 31:51.909
Four.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.744
I mean, four is tops.
Concurrent.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.013
Well, a deal has got to give <i>us</i>
<i>something, too, rios.</i>

31:56.015 --> 32:00.417
And if you don't want
your witnesses in court,

32:00.419 --> 32:02.819
Any other robbery charges
that may turn up

32:02.821 --> 32:04.855
Are included
in these four counts.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.090
Fine.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.692
If he gives it all up
today.

32:08.694 --> 32:11.094
And providing
his statement of facts proves

32:11.096 --> 32:13.030
That these were not
hate crimes.

32:16.467 --> 32:18.468
Here are
the bullet points.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.170
Have your client
look that over.

32:23.741 --> 32:26.143
Jennings: <i>Hypothetically,</i>
<i>mr. Allen's amenable.</i>

32:26.145 --> 32:27.844
<i>I know</i>
<i>you have some questions,</i>

32:27.846 --> 32:29.713
<i>But if your offer</i>
<i>should be refused,</i>

32:29.715 --> 32:31.515
<i>You can use nothing</i>
<i>he says here against him.</i>

32:31.517 --> 32:32.749
Emma: <i>Oh, of course.</i>

32:34.719 --> 32:37.421
Where do you
want me to start?

32:37.423 --> 32:39.156
Tell us about yourself.

32:39.158 --> 32:41.391
You were promoting
a club?

32:41.393 --> 32:43.694
No, that was
just for quick cash.

32:43.696 --> 32:46.129
I'm not, uh, a-a robber.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.497
[ door opens ]

32:47.499 --> 32:49.132
<i>I'm a musician.</i>

32:49.134 --> 32:51.168
<i>Been out here a year,</i>
<i>and it's rough finding gigs.</i>

32:51.170 --> 32:53.937
<i>No one hiring for sessions,</i>
<i>and I got to eat, you know?</i>

32:53.939 --> 32:55.138
Mm.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.473
That's how
all this got started.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.075
I was just trying
to get by.

32:58.077 --> 33:01.545
Anyway, I found this app
for my phone called dude ranch.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.514
It's used
primarily by gay men?

33:04.516 --> 33:07.417
Yeah, but this wasn't
a hate-crime thing.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.186
Jennings told me
what you said.

33:09.188 --> 33:12.622
Look, I only robbed those people
'cause I needed the money.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.890
Nothing else.
I see.

33:13.892 --> 33:17.561
So...You initially
used this app

33:17.563 --> 33:20.430
Solely as a way
to meet other men?

33:20.432 --> 33:21.431
Yes.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.933
Oh.

33:22.935 --> 33:25.602
And then, one night,
I was cruising dude ranch,

33:25.604 --> 33:27.437
And this guy
hit me up.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.640
We texted, and he said
to come over, so I did.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.542
And there I was
in this big house

33:32.544 --> 33:34.044
With all this
nice stuff --

33:34.046 --> 33:36.513
Stuff he didn't need,
believe me.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.783
And after we fooled around
and he fell asleep,

33:39.785 --> 33:41.785
I started poking around
in his closet,

33:41.787 --> 33:44.654
Just wishing
I had clothes like him.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.723
And then I found
this collection of watches --

33:46.725 --> 33:49.793
Really expensive,
like 20 of 'em.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.062
I mean,
who needs 20 watches?

33:52.064 --> 33:53.630
So, I took one,

33:53.632 --> 33:55.599
And I bet he still
doesn't even know it's gone.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.001
But I was able
to pay my rent that month.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.936
So you realized rich, gay men
were easy targets?

33:59.938 --> 34:01.738
No, no. It's not
that they were targets.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.541
It's, like, most of them
have, like, five of everything,

34:04.543 --> 34:06.076
So they'd never
call the police.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.544
And I only did this
a few times.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.612
And how would you do it?

34:09.881 --> 34:11.715
You have to say it.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.717
No lying, or no deal.

34:14.819 --> 34:16.720
<i>I'd drive into</i>
<i>a nice neighborhood</i>

<i>Using the app</i>
<i>to look for people.</i>

<i>If someone was into me,</i>
<i>I'd hit him up,</i>

<i>Tell him I lived</i>
<i>a few streets away.</i>

34:22.227 --> 34:23.927
<i>Usually,</i>
<i>they'd invite me over.</i>

34:23.929 --> 34:25.862
That establishes
his m.O.,

34:25.864 --> 34:27.697
But why aren't they dealing
on the murders?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.133

after the first guy.

but I had to be safe.

34:43.148 --> 34:45.015
You know, some of these guys
were bigger than me.

34:45.017 --> 34:46.750
I'd always make sure
he was alone,

34:46.752 --> 34:49.086
Make sure he wasn't
expecting anybody.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.587
We'd talk.

really quick and cuff him,

while I took his stuff,

And then buy a new pair of cuffs
the next day.

So, now we need you
to describe

All of the things
that you stole.

Only watches, jewelry,
computers --

if they had it.

Is it?

stop all this

somewhere -- I promise.

It was never my...Plan
to become a career criminal.

survival.

of an attempted robbery

a double homicide.

<i>This is ridiculous.</i>
<i>Don't say anything else.</i>

36:59.051 --> 37:01.218
Jennings: <i>Tyler, shut up!</i>
<i>Sanchez:</i>
<i>You</i> are <i>a murderer! He</i> is!

37:01.220 --> 37:03.186
This is new charges! We want
to see the evidentiary basis.
No, no, listen!

37:03.188 --> 37:04.688
You guys -- you guys
have all of this wrong!
Tyler! Tyler!

37:04.690 --> 37:05.789
What? What?
What do we have wrong, tyler?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.424
If it wasn't a murder,
what was it?

37:07.426 --> 37:09.759
Panic! Panic!
Tyler.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.094
It wasn't murder!
It was panic!
Tyler! Tyler!
That's enough!

37:11.096 --> 37:13.730
That's more than enough,
detective sanchez.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.132
Wait! No, wait! Wait!
Look! Wait! Look!

37:16.134 --> 37:18.134
That woman that came into
the house -- she scared me!

37:18.136 --> 37:19.903
I didn't mean to shoot her
at all!

37:19.905 --> 37:21.738
No, but after
you killed her,

37:21.740 --> 37:23.873
You went upstairs to a man
that you robbed and handcuffed,

37:23.875 --> 37:25.875
And you shot him
in the head!

37:25.877 --> 37:27.410
And you left behind the laptops
you were stealing!

37:27.412 --> 37:29.012
And the gun,

37:29.014 --> 37:31.414
Because you wanted your murder
to look like suicide.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.216
And I'm wondering,
do you remember --

37:33.218 --> 37:36.286
Did dr. Edwards beg for his life
before you blew his brains out?

37:36.288 --> 37:38.288
Is that why you stuffed
something in his mouth --

37:38.290 --> 37:41.157
So you wouldn't have to hear him
scream while you killed him?

37:41.159 --> 37:44.427
That sounds deliberate,
not panicked.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.030
What do <i>you</i> think,
mr. Jennings?

37:48.733 --> 37:51.368
You got an offer
in mind?

37:53.170 --> 37:56.139
How do you feel
about death row?

38:04.815 --> 38:06.916
[ police radio chatter ]

38:08.953 --> 38:10.487
Sykes:
Hey. Lieutenant.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.056
You make the death notification
to janet's husband?

38:13.058 --> 38:14.424
[ chuckling ] oh, yeah.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.993
I gave old dwayne
the good news -- no alimony.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.361
[ telephone ringing ]

38:18.363 --> 38:20.463
Do you know, he, uh,
he cried his eyes out?

38:20.465 --> 38:23.199
[ laughs ]
if he'd treated her better,
she'd still be alive.

38:24.201 --> 38:26.236
Hey, andy?
About this cleanse?

38:26.238 --> 38:29.272
I think I figured out where
all your energy's coming from.

38:29.274 --> 38:31.441
Yeah, I told you --
it's the ginkgo balboa.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.076
And the caffeine.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.110
[ chuckles ]

38:34.112 --> 38:35.412
No way.
Gimme that.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.913
It's right there --
fourth ingredient.

38:36.915 --> 38:37.914
What?

38:37.916 --> 38:39.449
[ stomps feet ]

38:39.451 --> 38:41.451
The cute girl
in the health-food store,

38:41.453 --> 38:42.519
She said that the --

38:42.521 --> 38:43.953
[ laughter ]

38:43.955 --> 38:46.456
Oh, I'm glad my trying
to improve my health

38:46.458 --> 38:48.258
Amuses you guys
so much.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.859
[ laughs ]

38:49.861 --> 38:51.361
Cynical jerks.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.797
[ laughter continues ]

38:53.799 --> 38:55.932
Sanchez:
"ginkgo balboa."

38:55.934 --> 38:57.334
[ laughs ]

38:57.336 --> 38:59.469
Oh, it's cool.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.404
[ knock on door ]

39:03.841 --> 39:06.042
Hey, guys.
Any news?

39:06.044 --> 39:07.777
Uh, yes and no.

39:07.779 --> 39:11.247
They found eight traceable
prints on the en...Velope.

39:11.249 --> 39:14.351
Uh, which came back
to four post-office employees,

39:14.353 --> 39:16.419
Your dcfs supervisor,
cynthia,

39:16.421 --> 39:19.322
You, a partial
from the captain...

39:20.491 --> 39:22.392
...And buzz.

39:22.394 --> 39:23.960
That's it?

39:25.796 --> 39:28.164
So...No bad guys.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.866
Isn't that
a good thing?

39:29.868 --> 39:31.968
No, it is not.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.970
Because
whoever wrote this letter

39:33.972 --> 39:36.439
Is taking
serious precautions

39:36.441 --> 39:38.541
To cover up
their identity.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.211
So, now what?

39:41.213 --> 39:43.213
Does that...Mean that...

39:44.181 --> 39:46.149
You're not gonna have to
send me away, are you?

39:46.151 --> 39:47.217
No.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.286
But until
we've had a chance

39:50.288 --> 39:53.022
To discuss extra security
with chief taylor,

39:53.024 --> 39:54.891
You can't take the car
to school,

39:54.893 --> 39:57.293
Hang out with your friends
afterwards

39:57.295 --> 40:00.130
Without a police officer
present.

40:00.132 --> 40:01.598
I'll arrange to have him
picked up by patrol

40:01.600 --> 40:03.566
Or one of us until...

40:03.568 --> 40:05.034
Until it's sorted out.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.303
"sorted out."

40:08.305 --> 40:12.409
So...What you're saying is,
I'm grounded.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.543
Till the trial.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.378
So, for the rest
of my life.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.916
But...

40:19.918 --> 40:21.584
[ sighs ]

40:21.586 --> 40:23.119
...In the meantime...

40:24.188 --> 40:25.622
...I live with you?

40:25.624 --> 40:26.623
For sure?

40:26.625 --> 40:28.324
You do.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.961
Well...

40:31.963 --> 40:33.430
I'll deal, then.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.936
[ breathes deeply ]

40:47.311 --> 40:49.312
[ sighs ]

40:51.415 --> 40:53.950
[ door opens ]

40:53.952 --> 40:55.385
[ clears throat ]

40:55.387 --> 40:57.053
It doesn't do much good

40:57.055 --> 41:00.657
To say that...
He'll understand someday.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.192
But it's all I have.

41:04.495 --> 41:08.097
[ voice breaking ]
he doesn't need to understand.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.967
He needs to stay safe.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.375
[ door opens ]

41:19.377 --> 41:21.978
[ door closes ]
