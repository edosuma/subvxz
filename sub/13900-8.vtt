00:08.630 --> 00:11.010
[Pickard] When did you plan to
skip town with Jake Doyle?

00:11.050 --> 00:14.180
The truth shall set you free,
Ms. Bennett.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.600
I told you. I got
nothing to hide.

00:36.700 --> 00:37.580
Leslie.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.750
So? What did you tell them?

00:41.790 --> 00:43.330
The truth. What did you
tell them?

00:43.370 --> 00:44.750
Everything, as far as I know.

00:44.790 --> 00:45.750
Is that what I think it is?

00:45.790 --> 00:46.920
Yes. It's-

00:46.960 --> 00:49.000
Look. We can't do this here.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.210
Okay.
What are we not doing here?

00:51.260 --> 00:52.510
Are you not doing it with me?

00:52.550 --> 00:55.800
[whispering]

00:57.140 --> 01:00.260
Oh. Why do we have to
whisper in your office?

01:00.310 --> 01:00.560
I'll tell you later.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.060
There might not be a later
if we don't figure out

01:03.100 --> 01:04.190
what happened last night.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.480
Then what are we waiting for?

01:06.520 --> 01:08.730
I can tell you one thing.

01:08.770 --> 01:10.190
This is not what I thought
I'd be doing

01:10.230 --> 01:11.650
five o'clock in the morning.

01:11.690 --> 01:11.990
We got three hours.

01:13.190 --> 01:14.740
If we wanna save your family
from prison-

01:14.780 --> 01:16.240
We better get started.

How'd you meet Barbara Warrick?

01:48.150 --> 01:51.270
Like I told you the first ten
times that you asked.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.530
She owns a security company.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.820
And she hired us to test
her alarm system.

01:55.860 --> 01:58.320
Is that a normal thing for you
to be hired to do?

01:58.360 --> 02:01.950
Well, you know. Nothing about
my job is exactly normal. So-

02:01.990 --> 02:04.580
Did you break into
Miss Warrick's house last night?

02:04.620 --> 02:06.540
Oh my God, you're
driving me insane.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.170
Why were you in
her house?

02:08.210 --> 02:09.420
Because she hired us.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.170
To test the
security system.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.210
Yeah.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.090
Do you have proof of that?

02:13.130 --> 02:14.050
No.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.130
But she hired us.

02:15.170 --> 02:16.760
To perform
a B and E.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.840
So it was a job.

02:17.880 --> 02:18.800
Yes. No. Yes.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.970
But no, not like a job-

02:21.010 --> 02:22.560
Like you're saying
the word "job".

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
Why would she do that?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.940
I don't know. Why
don't you just ask her?

02:28.810 --> 02:30.610
Ask.

02:31.690 --> 02:32.900
Barbara Warrick.

02:32.940 --> 02:33.730
That's her.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.400
So-
Just give her a call.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.660
And I'm sure she'll straighten
the whole thing out.

02:41.740 --> 02:44.290
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr. Doyle.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.830
Kindly wait in the hall.

02:46.870 --> 02:47.910
Wait in the hall?

02:47.960 --> 02:49.080
What, are we in high school?

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
You know what?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.420
Shag this. I'm going home.

02:51.460 --> 02:53.170
No you won't.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.420
You'll wait.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.850
[Mal] Yes, we were at a crime
scene. It's a hazard of the job.

03:04.430 --> 03:06.470
What is? Murder?

03:06.520 --> 03:07.430
Crime scenes.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.060
But this isn't one.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.520
A crime scene, I mean.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.270
You're a former police officer,
correct?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.070
Maybe you can clear
something up for us.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.400
Sure. But you better make sure

03:17.440 --> 03:18.900
you can pay my consulting fee.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.450
A man has to make a living.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.120
You were hired to break
into that house

03:24.160 --> 03:25.780
to test the
security system.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.830
I'm pretty sure I've
already answered that question.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.620
I'll take that
as a yes.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.460
Did you have a contract
with Ms. Warrick?

03:31.500 --> 03:32.920
No. Not exactly.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.460
Did she pay you
by check?

03:34.500 --> 03:35.420
No.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.670
Cash?

03:37.710 --> 03:38.010
It was a handshake
agreement.

03:39.090 --> 03:40.630
Payment upon
completion of the job.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.260
That's very
trusting of you.

03:44.220 --> 03:46.060
Mrs. Warrick
is a widow.

03:46.100 --> 03:46.390
Her husband died recently

03:47.720 --> 03:49.270
and she's trying to
run a business on her own.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.600
Given the slightly
soiled reputation

03:51.640 --> 03:53.730
of Doyle and Doyle
Investigations-

03:53.770 --> 03:55.770
Due in large part to my son-

03:55.810 --> 03:58.070
We have very little
bargaining power

03:58.110 --> 04:00.940
when it comes to negotiating
client contracts these days.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.610
So how does breaking into
her house help her?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.910
Not to mention you helped
yourself in the process.

04:05.950 --> 04:06.870
Right?

04:06.910 --> 04:07.790
What?

04:12.210 --> 04:14.790
[Rose] Well, of course we
did our homework.

04:14.830 --> 04:16.670
They have an alarm company

04:16.710 --> 04:18.880
that specializes in
high end security.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.760
For residential homes.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.090
That's right.

04:22.550 --> 04:23.930
The company's a bit behind the
times with technology.

04:23.970 --> 04:26.550
And Mrs. Warrick
is an interior designer,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.600
not an expert in alarm systems.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.680
But her husband had developed
this new product

04:30.720 --> 04:31.020
that hadn't been tested yet.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.230
It hooks up to your phone.
And it's completely wireless.

04:34.270 --> 04:35.480
How did Jake find this job?

04:35.520 --> 04:38.150
Did it come to him organically?

04:38.190 --> 04:38.520
Organically?

04:39.690 --> 04:41.150
How did you find this job,
Miss Doyle?

04:41.190 --> 04:41.530
It's Mrs. Doyle.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.280
Actually Mrs. Warrick
came to us.

04:45.860 --> 04:49.660
Listen, Jake hasn't really been
himself these days.

04:50.870 --> 04:52.250
He's got the weight
of the whole family

04:52.290 --> 04:53.330
on his shoulders right now.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.710
Wow, is it ever late.

04:58.130 --> 04:58.670
Um-

04:59.750 --> 05:02.460
You and I both know
this is routine.

05:02.510 --> 05:02.720
Why don't we just-

05:04.180 --> 05:04.880
call it a night and everybody go
home and get some sleep?

05:06.090 --> 05:08.930
How well do you get to
know your clients?

05:08.970 --> 05:09.180
Meaning-?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.350
Couldn't you say you could have
gotten all that information

05:12.390 --> 05:14.020
you just told me off
the internet?

05:14.060 --> 05:16.850
No, we prefer to
have human contact

05:16.900 --> 05:18.270
with the people who hire us.

05:18.310 --> 05:19.860
Does this contact
usually include

05:19.900 --> 05:21.530
three days of
surveilling the client?

05:30.490 --> 05:30.910
[Des] Stalking?

05:31.700 --> 05:33.370
I take offense to that.

05:33.410 --> 05:34.620
Then what would you call it?

05:34.660 --> 05:37.710
We were getting intelligence.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.540
By casing Miss Warrick's
house for three days

05:39.590 --> 05:39.790
and then breaking in.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.670
Now, when you put it like that,
it sounds all dirty.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.380
Sounds like a well
planned robbery.

05:44.420 --> 05:47.180
Well, thank you very much, but
it's not. It isn't. No.

05:47.220 --> 05:49.720
Why are you saying
things like that?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.220
What happened to your face?

05:51.260 --> 05:53.140
Are you trying to say I'm ugly?

05:53.180 --> 05:54.350
I was born like this.

05:54.390 --> 05:55.890
Your eye. What happened?

05:56.940 --> 06:01.360
I ran into a client's door
-fist.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.530
You don't sound too
sure about that.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.280
I don't sound too sure
about a lot of things.

06:05.320 --> 06:05.610
Why is that?

06:07.240 --> 06:10.070
Because Jake doesn't normally
let me talk with police types.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.450
Mr. Courtney,
didn't you have an altercation

06:12.490 --> 06:14.290
with a neighbor
of Ms. Warrick's?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.580
Altercation?

06:15.620 --> 06:16.540
Mr. Philip Miles?

06:18.210 --> 06:20.880
What does he have to do with the
house you were watching?

06:23.710 --> 06:25.960
He was outside. He was shagging
around with wires.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.550
I thought he was stealing cable
and I took a photo of him.

06:28.590 --> 06:28.840
Probably why he came after me.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.010
He came after you because you
took his photo?

06:32.050 --> 06:33.970
No, he didn't like that I was
outside Ms. Warrick's place.

06:34.010 --> 06:34.350
He was mad. Madder
than Jake.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.430
So it's safe to say that Jake
Doyle has a temper?

06:37.480 --> 06:39.270
It's safe to say when he's
not around.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.560
This altercation you had
with Mr. Miles

06:42.610 --> 06:43.940
caused enough of a disturbance

06:43.980 --> 06:45.110
that the police
showed up, correct?

06:45.150 --> 06:46.570
Well, that, sir, would be

06:46.610 --> 06:48.070
my word against
the investigating officer.

06:48.110 --> 06:49.030
Whoever they may be.

06:49.070 --> 06:50.240
I didn't get a name.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.790
[Tinny] I was responding to
a call near Bannerman Park.

06:54.830 --> 06:55.830
[Pickard]
After your shift.

06:55.870 --> 06:56.790
Yes.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.000
Who was involved?

06:58.040 --> 07:01.750
Des Courtney and another man.

07:01.790 --> 07:02.710
Philip Miles.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.670
Yes.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.170
Does this happen often?

07:05.210 --> 07:05.550
Does what happen often?

07:06.670 --> 07:07.720
Responding to calls
about the Doyles?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.170
Sometimes.

07:09.220 --> 07:09.800
They're private investigators.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.760
Usually investigating people who
are committing crimes.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.010
They're also your family.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.220
Do you work for them as
well as the police?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.390
I'm a police officer.

07:18.430 --> 07:19.850
Not a P.I.

07:19.890 --> 07:21.980
That' kind of a weird question.

07:22.020 --> 07:24.230
What did you do when you arrived
at the disturbance?

07:24.270 --> 07:24.940
I diffused the situation.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.820
Which wasn't hard because it was
just a misunderstanding.

07:28.860 --> 07:30.900
Misunderstanding over what?

07:30.950 --> 07:31.200
Philip Miles thought

07:32.490 --> 07:34.030
that Des Courtney was peeping
on Mrs. Warrick.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.580
He was very protective.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.620
Does that mean you did nothing?

07:37.660 --> 07:40.120
It means that Mr. Miles didn't
file a report.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.460
And neither did Mr. Courtney.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.630
Mr. Courtney. That's-

07:43.670 --> 07:46.670
a tad bit formal when referring
to a boyfriend, isn't it?

07:46.710 --> 07:48.090
We're just dating.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.050
He's not a boyfriend?

07:50.220 --> 07:52.340
I don't really see how
that's relevant.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.970
So you wrote no report
on the incident.

07:55.010 --> 07:55.720
No.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.970
Very interesting on that one.

08:01.890 --> 08:04.480
So what did you do, Constable?

08:04.520 --> 08:07.650
I verbally told my superior
officer about it.

08:07.690 --> 08:08.860
Sergeant Leslie Bennett.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.650
And what did she do with the
information?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.700
You'd have to ask her.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.620
Sir.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.750
Did you follow up on the
information given to you

08:25.790 --> 08:26.090
by Constable Doyle?

08:27.170 --> 08:27.380
There was nothing to
follow up on.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.010
Has your relationship with the
Doyles ever compromised your...

08:31.880 --> 08:33.930
...oath as a police officer?

08:33.970 --> 08:35.140
You read my service record.

08:35.180 --> 08:36.970
You tell me.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.850
What is the extent of
your relationship?

08:38.890 --> 08:41.640
Are you and Jake
romantically involved?

08:42.770 --> 08:44.520
Next question.

08:44.560 --> 08:44.850
And by the way,

08:46.230 --> 08:47.400
my gut tells me this
isn't just about a break-in.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.820
So you better come up with
evidence of something soon.

08:50.860 --> 08:51.070
Or else.

08:52.690 --> 08:52.950
And what does your gut tell you
about last night, Sergeant?

08:54.410 --> 08:56.280
That the Doyles were doing a job
they were hired to do.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.450
So why do you think
we're still here?

08:58.490 --> 08:59.620
At midnight?

08:59.660 --> 09:00.290
I have no idea.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.920
But you can bet I'm gonna figure
out sooner than later.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.500
Who is this Pickard
fella anyway?

09:08.540 --> 09:08.750
I've never seen
him before.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.260
He's likely high up on
the food chain.

09:11.300 --> 09:11.590
That sounds promising.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.010
I know where to go
to figure this out.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.010
It'll be quiet 'til eight A.M.
Give me the box.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.850
No, no. Leslie. You gotta
let me handle this.

09:17.890 --> 09:18.800
Stay out of it.

09:18.850 --> 09:19.060
I'm the cop here.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.310
Let me figure this out my way.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.730
Follow me. Keep your head down.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.570
Can I have a coffee?

09:32.610 --> 09:33.490
Where's the money?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.780
Mrs. Warrick hasn't paid us yet.

09:36.820 --> 09:39.070
The money that was in
Barbara Warrick's safe.

09:39.120 --> 09:39.410
The one that you cracked.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.540
We didn't steal any money. And
we didn't know about any safe.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.000
You wanna try again?

10:02.390 --> 10:02.640
[Mal] Jake may be pig headed.

10:03.890 --> 10:05.390
And unconventional,
but he's no criminal.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.730
In fact, he always gets
the job done in the end.

10:07.770 --> 10:07.980
And I admire him for it.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.400
But it's not the way you handle
things, now is it, Malachy?

10:13.360 --> 10:15.530
So, about last night?

10:15.570 --> 10:17.990
Did Jake get the job done?

10:21.780 --> 10:24.240
So you don't know anything about
the money in the safe?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.160
Of course not.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.880
We both know he's
facing a murder charge.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.340
And no. He didn't
do that either.

10:38.130 --> 10:38.430
I didn't know
what to do.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.970
I don't know how to say no
to either one of them.

10:41.010 --> 10:41.350
Malachy and Jake Doyle?

10:42.550 --> 10:44.560
It's like trying to
please two fathers.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.310
Or one father. And one
big, angrier brother.

10:48.350 --> 10:49.690
And in the end,
I normally just listen

10:49.730 --> 10:50.810
to whoever's yelling at me.

10:50.850 --> 10:51.650
Most of the times it's Jake.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.110
But you're devoted to him.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.030
Yes.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.610
Does Jake Doyle intimidate you?

10:57.650 --> 10:59.610
Yes! But he-

11:01.110 --> 11:03.490
He intimidates me. But -

11:03.530 --> 11:05.160
It's-

11:05.200 --> 11:06.790
For my own good.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.080
You've applied for, what,
ten credit cards recently?

11:10.120 --> 11:12.710
Your credit rating is as low
as it could possibly be.

11:12.750 --> 11:13.000
Which begs the question-

11:14.210 --> 11:15.630
Don't you draw a pay check
from the Doyles?

11:15.670 --> 11:17.050
When's the next high tide?

11:17.090 --> 11:18.420
What do you mean?

11:18.470 --> 11:20.090
That's kinda my
unofficial pay period.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.930
So, you were broke.

11:21.970 --> 11:22.890
Yes.

11:22.930 --> 11:23.850
You were desperate.

11:23.890 --> 11:24.260
Hell, yes!

11:25.390 --> 11:26.140
Wait, what are we talking
about here?

11:27.470 --> 11:29.350
[Pickard] Did you learn your
skill with numbers

11:29.390 --> 11:30.730
while incarcerated?

11:30.770 --> 11:32.230
[Rose]
I was never in prison.

11:32.270 --> 11:33.860
And yet you have a
criminal record.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.150
That was a long time ago.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.190
Misspent youth?

11:38.150 --> 11:39.400
Bad choice in husbands.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.740
Yes, I do know my way around
a financial statement.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.870
And yes, I handle the finances

11:45.910 --> 11:47.240
for Doyle and Doyle
Investigations.

11:47.290 --> 11:47.620
So what?

11:48.790 --> 11:49.710
You recently missed a
mortgage payment.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.500
You even filed an application
for a third mortgage-

11:53.540 --> 11:54.500
But were denied.

11:54.540 --> 11:55.290
Is that accurate?

11:56.590 --> 11:58.420
Yeah. What does that have
to do with anything?

11:58.460 --> 12:00.880
It would seem your family
needs this job badly.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.380
That's what I tried to
tell Malachy.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.640
But he didn't want to take it.

12:03.680 --> 12:03.970
Why not?

12:05.600 --> 12:05.890
Because Mrs. Warrick's husband
left her with a huge tax bill.

12:07.100 --> 12:07.350
And everything in the house
was gonna be

12:08.140 --> 12:08.430
seized by the government.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.350
He didn't think we'd
ever get paid.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.230
Exactly.

12:12.270 --> 12:12.600
Exactly what?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.560
You knew exactly where that
money was and how to get it.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.320
We didn't rob any one. Okay?

12:17.360 --> 12:19.360
In fact, we were robbed.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.900
You were robbed?

12:20.940 --> 12:21.150
Yes.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.160
Did you file a police report?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.110
No.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.200
Why not?

12:25.240 --> 12:25.530
Let's just say the next time

12:26.780 --> 12:28.490
a sixteen year old girl
shows up at your door.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.660
And claims she's your daughter,

12:29.700 --> 12:31.120
Make sure the DNA test is real.

12:31.910 --> 12:32.330
I'll keep that in mind.

12:33.790 --> 12:35.830
Of course I know Sloan Daniels.
She robbed us blind.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.540
But she's actually a
really good person.

12:37.590 --> 12:37.880
She's one of us.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.170
She was one of us.
She's bad.

12:42.670 --> 12:44.130
We filed an insurance claim

12:44.180 --> 12:45.470
to try to get the money
that was stolen.

12:45.510 --> 12:47.720
And yet you withdrew
the application.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.100
Yeah.

12:49.140 --> 12:50.970
-Why?
-It's really complicated.

12:51.020 --> 12:51.430
Maybe not.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.020
Maybe it's because
you were the ones

12:54.060 --> 12:55.690
who stole your own money in
the first place.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.060
Sorry, what was that?

12:58.440 --> 12:59.400
In here.

13:00.650 --> 13:01.610
Take this.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.070
Whatever you're doing
I hope it works.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.610
My entire family is
about to go down.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.870
Yeah. Not to mention
me and my career.

13:07.910 --> 13:10.290
I was referring to you
when I said family.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.740
Not that I'm implying that
you and I have

13:11.790 --> 13:13.330
a brother and sister
like relationship.

13:13.370 --> 13:13.660
Obviously, we don't.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.000
We have a very
much a you and me-

13:16.040 --> 13:19.130
You know, different type
of relationship.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.300
Jake, I gotta tell you
something.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.840
Tell me what?

13:28.550 --> 13:28.800
Everything's gonna be fine.

13:30.430 --> 13:33.020
You gotta tell me exactly what
happened at the Warrick's house.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.440
Don't leave anything out.

13:35.850 --> 13:36.850
Come on.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.400
That's you back there.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.740
Isn't it Malachy?

13:47.030 --> 13:48.450
Where did you get this?

13:49.700 --> 13:51.200
Oh, jeez.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.120
Des.

13:52.870 --> 13:54.450
I didn't see him coming.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.290
He was huge. And all of a sudden
he was just there.

13:58.330 --> 13:58.630
It was like an eclipse.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.380
And I put up my phone
to protect myself.

14:01.420 --> 14:01.710
Like a defense mechanism.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.130
My investigative training was
kicking in, you know.

14:05.170 --> 14:05.470
Where were you when you
were attacked?

14:07.010 --> 14:09.050
I was in the truck, which is
harder to spot than the van.

14:09.090 --> 14:10.010
But that blew up.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.050
Why did it get blown up?

14:11.100 --> 14:11.470
It was kind of on-

14:12.640 --> 14:12.850
purpose, but not.
But it's a long story.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.600
It worked out fine. We
got the insurance money.

14:15.640 --> 14:15.850
You don't need to
write that down.

14:17.310 --> 14:19.350
What were you doing in the truck
when you were attacked?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.150
That's technical.
And top secret.

14:22.190 --> 14:24.360
And I need to get a sign off.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.110
How does an obstruction of
justice charge sound to you?

14:30.820 --> 14:32.740
I, uh.

14:33.990 --> 14:34.200
Okay. I set up a local server.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.920
And I tapped into the security
protocols to monitor the zones.

14:38.960 --> 14:39.250
The zones.

14:40.330 --> 14:40.630
The zones in Barbara
Warrick's house.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.540
So that when Jake went
through them during the test,

14:43.590 --> 14:43.800
he would know if there was
a system breach.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.090
And we would catch it before a
call was triggered to the cops.

14:47.130 --> 14:47.420
But I failed.

14:48.510 --> 14:48.720
And that hurts
more than anything.

14:50.010 --> 14:50.300
Even more than my face,
which really hurts.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.350
So you really didn't want any
part of this job, did you?

14:54.680 --> 14:56.890
I told Rose I didn't think we
should take it.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.770
So why were you at Barbara
Warrick's house?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.650
I didn't like the setup.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.560
-Jake-
-Went anyway.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.980
Yeah. And I went to stop him
before it was too late.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.740
[Pickard] So what was it
the neighbor-

15:07.780 --> 15:09.320
Philip Miles, said to you
three days ago?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.200
Okay. But you can't repeat
this to anyone.

15:11.240 --> 15:11.450
Especially not with kids.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.120
He kept saying over and over.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.080
You're nailing her.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.750
An awful way to describe
someone so beautiful.

15:19.790 --> 15:22.580
When you went back last night,
he attacked you. Why?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.040
Were you nailing Ms. Warrick?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.920
No! No. I'm spoken for.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.300
You're referring, of course,
to Constable Tinny Doyle.

15:28.340 --> 15:28.670
Maybe, who's asking?

15:30.010 --> 15:31.680
Were the flower you found
in the truck for her?

15:31.720 --> 15:33.050
No. They were for Ms. Warrick.

15:33.090 --> 15:34.680
In fact, you were nailing her!

15:34.720 --> 15:36.600
You were casing out her
house last night.

15:36.640 --> 15:36.970
Because you were
making damn sure

15:38.140 --> 15:39.520
that Jake didn't trip the
silent alarm-

15:39.560 --> 15:40.480
when you robbed her.

15:41.350 --> 15:42.810
Does that sound about right?

15:42.850 --> 15:45.150
Okay. Can I say "no"?

15:45.190 --> 15:47.400
Because I feel really dizzy.
I think I need to take a break.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.190
It's been, like, six hours now.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.700
Actually, it's been about
six minutes.

15:51.740 --> 15:53.950
See? Three hundred and sixty
seconds. That's a lot.

15:53.990 --> 15:56.080
Can we just take an eensy weensy
teensy little break?

15:56.120 --> 15:57.160
Is that so much?

15:57.200 --> 15:59.000
So why couldn't you get to Jake?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.790
Because Des was
taking a pounding.

16:00.830 --> 16:01.040
From Philip Miles.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.920
Who saw you casing the house
three days earlier and-

16:04.960 --> 16:06.750
Now believed you were
back there to rob it.

16:06.790 --> 16:09.090
I suppose it may have looked
like that to the uninformed.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.420
So he tried to stop you.

16:10.470 --> 16:10.670
Maybe.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.090
It seemed more like a jealous
rage than a concerned neighbor.

16:14.140 --> 16:14.430
We believe that you had

16:15.640 --> 16:17.930
no interest
in communicating with Jake.

16:17.970 --> 16:18.270
Why would you believe that?

16:19.890 --> 16:21.730
Because you were the one that
planned the robbery all along.

16:21.770 --> 16:22.100
That's not what happened.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.940
If you wanted to stop him,
why didn't you call Jake?

16:24.980 --> 16:26.310
I did.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.400
His ringer was
probably turned off

16:27.440 --> 16:28.610
which is why I sent him a text.

16:28.650 --> 16:30.360
-Did Jake respond?
-No.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.150
-What did the text say?
-I can't remember.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.490
Likely something about him
being a great son.

16:34.530 --> 16:35.410
The usual.

16:36.780 --> 16:38.330
Okay.

16:38.370 --> 16:39.240
Well, it's late.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.120
You're tired.

16:43.160 --> 16:49.340
So, let's refresh your
memory, shall we?

16:49.380 --> 16:51.090
Read it please?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.970
Hey moron,
now that you're inside,

16:57.010 --> 16:58.350
make sure you get the money.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
I am glad that this thing
is all over.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.610
It was obviously just huge
misunderstanding.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.910
You know, I know it looked
bad that Des is just-

17:18.950 --> 17:20.790
If he did what I told him,

17:20.830 --> 17:22.250
then he never would have
left the truck.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.500
And he wouldn't have
tripped the alarm.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.000
And you wouldn't have showed up.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.460
And we would have done our job.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.250
Filed our paperwork,
gotten paid.

17:28.290 --> 17:28.540
And Ms. Warrick would
have been happy

17:30.090 --> 17:32.420
that we were testing her faulty
friggin' security system.

17:32.460 --> 17:35.380
Oh, but you did beat the system,
Jake.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.760
Almost.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.550
But you made one mistake.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.810
What are you talking about?
I beat the system?

17:41.850 --> 17:43.850
Barbara Warrick was the only
person alive

17:43.890 --> 17:45.060
who knew what was
in the safe.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.600
And the combination to open it.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.980
And you didn't expect her
to be home.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.860
Home? I know for a
fact she wasn't home.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.820
Oh? Really? How did
you know that?

17:57.530 --> 18:00.080
The plan was, she was supposed
to stay in a hotel that night.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.030
The night that we were -

18:01.080 --> 18:01.290
Look, why don't you-

18:02.450 --> 18:02.700
I said this a million
times already -

18:04.330 --> 18:07.120
Call the woman and she will tell
you that all of this is true.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.880
We're gonna have a little
problem doing that.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.300
[Jake]
Mrs. Warrick.

18:14.550 --> 18:17.430
What was she doing in the house?

18:17.470 --> 18:18.800
You were there, Jake.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.260
You tell me.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.530
Hey Jake.

18:36.190 --> 18:37.400
What's your problem?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.280
Besides the one I'm looking at?

18:39.320 --> 18:40.700
If I was on the
other side of this,

18:40.740 --> 18:42.070
looking at all the evidence.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.910
I know. We look very
good for murder

18:43.950 --> 18:44.240
and a bit of robbery.

18:45.330 --> 18:46.660
What were you doing
in that house?

18:46.710 --> 18:47.620
No bullshit.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.710
Tell me.

18:48.750 --> 18:48.960
What are you asking me, exactly?

18:49.830 --> 18:50.500
Who killed that woman, Jake?

18:51.830 --> 18:53.630
And what do you know that
you're not telling me?

18:53.670 --> 18:56.170
I'm not telling you, not, not
telling you. I don't know.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.260
I don't know anything.

18:57.300 --> 18:57.550
Okay?

18:59.090 --> 19:00.340
Whoever killed her- Maybe
someone else got into the house

19:00.390 --> 19:01.550
that we don't know about.

19:01.590 --> 19:02.600
Any idea who?

19:02.640 --> 19:04.100
No. I wish.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.520
You're gonna need
more than that.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.060
I'm working on it.

19:11.400 --> 19:11.730
As far as I know,

19:13.060 --> 19:14.520
it's not a crime to meet
with a real estate agent.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.690
Of course it isn't.

19:15.730 --> 19:16.030
So?

19:17.400 --> 19:19.110
You recently got appraisals
on the Doyle house-

19:19.150 --> 19:20.740
And the property you own
and operate, The Duke.

19:20.780 --> 19:21.110
Is that correct?

19:22.740 --> 19:23.080
We were looking at our options
from a financial perspective.

19:24.410 --> 19:25.450
Or you were gonna
take the money from the heist

19:25.490 --> 19:26.830
and the sale of the properties.

19:26.870 --> 19:27.790
And leave town.

19:27.830 --> 19:28.120
No.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.920
The family has fallen
on hard times.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.580
I'm suggesting you might have
a golden parachute.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.170
Look, Malachy knew there was
something wrong

19:35.210 --> 19:36.210
with this
case from the start.

19:36.250 --> 19:36.630
Is that so?

19:37.960 --> 19:39.470
Yeah. We just needed more
time to figure it out.

19:39.510 --> 19:41.300
What we think you needed to
figure out was

19:41.340 --> 19:43.300
what to do with Barbara Warrick-
when you found her in the house.

19:43.340 --> 19:44.680
That's why the robbery
went sideways.

19:44.720 --> 19:44.930
And she ended up dead.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.220
What about Philip Miles and his
connection to Mrs. Warrick?

19:48.270 --> 19:50.520
Is he in here being questioned
for her murder?

19:50.560 --> 19:50.770
What's his motive?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.860
Figure it out yourself.
That's your job.

19:56.980 --> 19:58.190
[Des] Philip Miles was studying

19:58.230 --> 19:59.740
horticulture in college.

19:59.780 --> 20:00.950
And then he dropped
out. So it turns out-

20:00.990 --> 20:01.280
He wasn't a cable stealer.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.370
He was working for Barbara
Warrick's rich neighbors-

20:04.410 --> 20:05.870
as their estate manager.

20:05.910 --> 20:06.160
And they had a greenhouse.

20:07.410 --> 20:07.740
And he grew flowers.
And he gave them to her.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.540
Like the flowers we found
in your truck.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.250
Exactly. Philip Miles tried
to give them to her

20:12.290 --> 20:12.500
a couple of days ago.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.040
And she slammed
the door in his face.

20:15.080 --> 20:15.340
How did you end up with them?

20:16.670 --> 20:18.920
I have photos of Philip Miles
and Ms. Warrick

20:18.960 --> 20:21.220
together at her place.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.640
He just threw the flower away
and they landed on me.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.640
In your truck.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.720
I'm not a perv.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.050
I was in the bushes, silly.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.810
Anyway. I guess he can
afford to throw away

20:28.850 --> 20:29.220
a whole bouquet of flowers.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.770
We can't all have our own
personal greenhouse.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.310
He gave her a lot of flowers.

20:33.350 --> 20:35.110
That doesn't necessarily make
him a murderer.

20:35.150 --> 20:35.440
Says you.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.270
Philip Miles delivered flowers
to Mrs. Warrick's office

20:38.320 --> 20:38.610
fifteen times

20:40.190 --> 20:42.240
the week before her husband
Jerry died of a heart attack.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.660
Seems like love. Or harassment.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.450
Or maybe something
else entirely.

20:46.490 --> 20:48.660
We realized that there was more
going on

20:48.700 --> 20:48.950
than the client was telling us.

20:50.120 --> 20:50.450
And we were just trying
to warn Jake.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.210
How could you know all of
this in three days?

20:53.250 --> 20:54.580
Because we're really good
at what we do.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.790
Unlike certain investigators.

20:57.290 --> 20:57.590
Possibly.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.590
But it's more likely you're
trying to sell a story

21:00.630 --> 21:01.550
to save yourselves.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.470
Look, if you had a case-

21:03.510 --> 21:05.130
Where the husband dies.
And then later-

21:05.180 --> 21:06.680
You find out that
the wife was the object

21:06.720 --> 21:06.930
of someone's obsession-

21:07.850 --> 21:08.680
Wouldn't that make you think?

21:08.720 --> 21:09.720
Just a little bit.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.320
[Leslie] What do I know
about Jerry Warrick?

21:22.940 --> 21:23.860
That he's dead.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.070
That's it?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.320
Is Jerry Warrick's death
an active case?

21:27.370 --> 21:28.240
No.

21:29.740 --> 21:32.830
So why did I take it out of
records for the Doyles?

21:32.870 --> 21:35.040
Do you normally share
confidential information

21:35.080 --> 21:35.420
with civilians?

21:36.790 --> 21:38.210
They were suspicious
about how Mr. Warrick died.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.460
What are you accusing them of?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.050
There are no
charges pending yet.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.800
We're just gathering
the evidence.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.800
And trying to piece
together the whole story.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.640
What was the cause of
Mr. Warrick's death?

21:47.680 --> 21:49.350
He died of a heart attack.

21:50.180 --> 21:52.140
Was that suspicious?

21:52.180 --> 21:54.680
No. He had an existing
heart condition.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.640
In other words,
you found nothing.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.480
Except a motive and -

21:58.520 --> 22:00.690
An opportunity for the Doyles,

22:00.730 --> 22:02.940
who have this ridiculous theory

22:02.980 --> 22:05.900
about the murder. Which they're
trying to use as a smokescreen

22:05.950 --> 22:07.030
to cover up their crime.

22:08.070 --> 22:09.950
You worried about the trial?

22:09.990 --> 22:12.370
I'm not sure they have enough on
us to charge us yet.

22:12.410 --> 22:12.740
But whatever.

22:13.910 --> 22:14.200
You know what trial
I'm talking about.

22:15.620 --> 22:18.080
This is life or death, Jake.
I'm worried about you.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.170
Where all this could lead.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.590
To be honest with you,
I'm not feeling great, okay?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.130
Whoever it is that's framing me
for Clark's murder

22:25.170 --> 22:26.300
is doing a pretty good job. So-

22:27.220 --> 22:29.840
I'm not feeling exactly hopeful.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.890
Let's just focus on one murder
at a time, okay?

22:32.930 --> 22:33.180
Speaking of -

22:34.310 --> 22:34.600
You don't have
anything here on hand

22:35.640 --> 22:37.060
that's gonna save us yet,
do you?

22:37.100 --> 22:37.940
Not yet.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.860
Must be nice not having I.A.
breathing down your neck.

22:42.900 --> 22:43.940
Yeah. It is.

22:45.820 --> 22:50.120
Hey. I think I got something.

22:51.530 --> 22:52.700
What is that? A flower?

22:52.740 --> 22:52.990
A lily.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.580
This particular beautiful and
sweetly scented variety of lily-

22:57.620 --> 22:59.000
is extremely toxic.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.380
It could be used as a poison.

23:03.540 --> 23:04.500
Do you think the toxin-

23:04.550 --> 23:04.880
from the lily could-

23:06.210 --> 23:07.800
Could make a poisoning
look like a heart attack?

23:10.180 --> 23:10.760
Maybe.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.760
Is there an autopsy report on
Jerry Warrick's death?

23:14.810 --> 23:15.720
No.

23:15.770 --> 23:16.060
Why would there be?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.270
It didn't seem like it was
suspicious.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.900
I'll get the M.E.'s findings.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.320
There'll be a Tox report.

23:24.940 --> 23:26.400
[ring]

23:26.440 --> 23:27.570
Come on. Pick up.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.740
Have a bit of patience, b'y.
It's still early.

23:31.780 --> 23:33.160
They're probably not
even in yet.

23:36.740 --> 23:39.040
I was investigating an
active murder case.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.420
About ex-Mayor Clark.

23:40.460 --> 23:40.620
That's right.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.040
And ignoring the explicit order
of your superior

23:44.090 --> 23:45.590
not to get involved.

23:45.630 --> 23:45.960
She didn't-

23:47.210 --> 23:48.760
She doesn't have the
information that I do.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.090
What information?

23:50.510 --> 23:51.970
The video showing that Jake
couldn't have done it.

23:52.010 --> 23:53.470
And where is this video now?

23:53.510 --> 23:54.010
I don't know.

23:55.350 --> 23:58.140
That seems to be a common
thing here, Sergeant.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.140
What's that?

23:59.180 --> 24:00.100
Jake Doyle and murder.

24:00.140 --> 24:01.230
Jake Doyle is innocent.

24:01.270 --> 24:02.190
Of what?

24:02.230 --> 24:02.480
Everything.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.650
Listen to yourself.
How do you know?

24:04.690 --> 24:05.730
I just do.

24:05.770 --> 24:06.780
And we're gonna prove it.

24:06.820 --> 24:07.780
Who's we?

24:07.820 --> 24:09.490
You and Jake Doyle?

24:13.280 --> 24:15.450
You met with Dr. Ronan,
the psychologist.

24:15.490 --> 24:16.740
That's confidential.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.870
His final report expresses-

24:18.910 --> 24:19.200
And I quote -

24:20.290 --> 24:20.620
Deep concern
about the relationship

24:21.750 --> 24:23.710
Sergeant Bennett has
with the accused.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.920
I'd take what he reports
with a grain of salt.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.050
What's this really about?
What am I doing here?

24:31.260 --> 24:31.510
You're testimony on
behalf of the Doyles

24:33.130 --> 24:35.140
carries no weight in the Barbara
Warrick murder investigation.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.760
And why is that?

24:39.560 --> 24:41.270
Why? Answer me?

24:41.310 --> 24:43.310
Because of the ongoing Internal
Affairs investigation

24:43.350 --> 24:44.650
against you, Sergeant.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.610
You're a dirty cop.

24:46.650 --> 24:47.900
How dare you?

24:47.940 --> 24:49.280
We have evidence.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.570
You're lying.
Who are you really?

24:52.780 --> 24:56.370
Just an honest cop
looking for the truth.

24:56.410 --> 24:57.910
And I think I found it.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.090
[Jake] What am I looking
at? I'm confused.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.010
Your phone logs.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.300
My phone logs?

25:14.340 --> 25:14.680
That's a little bit creepy, no?

25:16.180 --> 25:18.510
Last night you received a text
from your father Malachy,

25:18.550 --> 25:21.020
Probably. It was likely a
load of gibberish.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.980
He's old. He's senile.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.140
And he has a real difficulty
with the old touch screen.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.480
Do you remember what it said?

25:26.520 --> 25:28.270
Probably something fatherly,
loving.

25:28.310 --> 25:28.520
That's his style.

25:30.150 --> 25:31.650
It says: Moron. Now that you're
in, make sure you get the money.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.330
This is your smoking gun.

25:40.370 --> 25:42.750
It confirms that you were in the
house to get the money.

25:42.790 --> 25:44.410
It could mean that I was
waiting to get paid

25:44.460 --> 25:46.080
for the job we just did.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.420
Or maybe he wanted me to go to
a bank machine.

25:48.460 --> 25:49.960
Or maybe it was a million
other things.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.420
You also received a phone call

25:51.460 --> 25:53.090
while you were in
Ms. Warrick's house.

25:53.130 --> 25:54.880
I did.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.510
From your lawyer, Walter McLean.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.510
What did he say to you?

25:59.550 --> 26:00.970
That's none of your business.

26:01.010 --> 26:02.680
You know,
the whole doctor, lawyer

26:02.720 --> 26:04.270
patient confidentiality thing.

26:04.310 --> 26:05.940
He told you that your trial had
been moved up.

26:07.440 --> 26:07.650
Again,
from where you're sitting,

26:09.110 --> 26:10.770
you think you got a
dead to rights case against me.

26:10.810 --> 26:13.030
You think that I killed missus.
I stole all the money.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.940
And maybe you think I was about
to leave town.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.900
It does seem to be the
only option.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.450
I guess it doesn't matter to you
that none of that's true.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.740
Does Sergeant Bennett know that
your trial's been moved up?

26:30.590 --> 26:31.500
He was deranged.

26:31.540 --> 26:31.880
Philip Miles?

26:33.210 --> 26:34.460
You should pick him
up. He looks like a pretty

26:34.510 --> 26:34.800
good suspect for
all of this.

26:36.050 --> 26:37.630
And Jake was in the
house the whole time.

26:37.670 --> 26:39.430
But Jake didn't know Mrs.
Warrick was even there.

26:39.470 --> 26:41.430
Miles probably did.

26:41.470 --> 26:44.060
Okay. Thank you Malachy.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.690
You have been most helpful.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.060
I appreciate you coming in.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.230
I realize this has been
difficult for you.

26:53.020 --> 26:53.400
By the way,

26:54.900 --> 26:57.110
did you realize your wife
is trying to sell your house?

27:03.580 --> 27:06.370
[Jake] So we know that Miles was
sweet on Mrs. Warrick.

27:06.410 --> 27:07.870
But he couldn't be with her
until the husband

27:07.910 --> 27:08.120
was out of the way.

27:09.210 --> 27:09.420
So they
killed her husband, Jerry,

27:10.330 --> 27:12.080
with the poison from the lily.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.210
Neither one of them knew he
owed a shitload in taxes.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.130
Miles must have found out that
everything was gonna be seized.

27:17.170 --> 27:17.470
And that he wasn't gonna
get a dime.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.550
So what? He decides to rob her
and kill her

27:20.590 --> 27:22.760
the same way as
they killed her husband?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.180
It makes sense.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.890
It has to, since he's
our only lead.

27:25.930 --> 27:27.640
There's only one problem.

27:27.680 --> 27:27.850
You'd need a blood test

27:29.350 --> 27:32.360
to prove the presence of
glycol- whatever you called it-

27:32.400 --> 27:33.860
from the lily.

27:33.900 --> 27:35.400
There was no blood test done

27:35.440 --> 27:37.280
to see if there was poison in
Jerry's system.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.360
And plus the coroner's report
say Ms. Warrick wasn't poisoned.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.030
How did she die?

27:42.070 --> 27:42.990
Blunt force trauma.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.700
And a broken neck.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.040
Philip Miles?

27:46.080 --> 27:47.370
We know he had a temper.

27:47.410 --> 27:48.540
It couldn't have been Miles.

27:48.580 --> 27:49.910
Look.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.170
There's a time
stamp on this photo.

27:52.210 --> 27:52.500
It proves he didn't kill her.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.800
He was outside at the
established time of death.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.090
There was only one person in
that house

28:00.130 --> 28:01.510
that could have
killed Mrs. Warrick.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.140
Me.

28:11.230 --> 28:11.520
[Jake] There is no way-

28:12.600 --> 28:13.900
that I tripped that
silent alarm.

28:13.940 --> 28:14.860
You're right.

28:14.900 --> 28:16.230
You did not.

28:16.270 --> 28:18.070
I didn't? What?

28:18.110 --> 28:20.900
Barbara Warrick triggered
the silent alarm herself.

28:20.940 --> 28:23.700
See? Now we're getting
somewhere.

28:23.740 --> 28:26.450
She did it on purpose as someone
was trying to kill her.

28:26.490 --> 28:27.990
Oh, here we go.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.120
You were there to rob
Ms. Warrick's safe.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.670
But when you found
her in the house-

28:33.710 --> 28:35.710
You murdered her.

28:37.710 --> 28:39.840
Time to fess up, Jake Doyle.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.940
You were a first responder.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.490
Seems like a pattern with you.

29:02.530 --> 29:05.910
Why, of all people,
did you show up first?

29:05.950 --> 29:07.910
I wasn't even supposed to
be working last night.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.540
I'm aware of that. So?

29:10.580 --> 29:13.410
I was on my way home
after a double shift.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.750
I need the money.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.170
It's a common theme with
the Doyle clan.

29:16.210 --> 29:16.460
Is that a crime now?

29:17.590 --> 29:18.630
Tell me about one of the
investigators

29:18.670 --> 29:19.880
working at Doyle and Doyle?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.010
Des Courtney.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.180
What would you say is the nature
of your relationship?

29:25.220 --> 29:26.680
You already asked me about this.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.300
I'm asking again.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.970
We're just dating.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.980
You're just dating.

29:35.020 --> 29:36.650
Really.

29:36.690 --> 29:38.650
We're definitely
more than dating.

29:38.690 --> 29:40.480
I think she has a
different view.

29:40.520 --> 29:40.860
What do you mean?

29:42.030 --> 29:42.360
You might wanna check
with her on that.

29:43.650 --> 29:47.370
No, we're close. We're like,
very, very close.

29:47.410 --> 29:48.570
I wanna marry her.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.490
Don't tell Jake.

29:53.250 --> 29:53.500
Are you recording this
conversation?

29:54.910 --> 29:56.670
Did Jake and Malachy ask you
to ask me that question?

29:56.710 --> 29:58.080
Did Constable Doyle warn you

29:58.130 --> 29:58.420
that the police
were on their way-

29:59.540 --> 30:00.880
So you could hide the
stolen money?

30:00.920 --> 30:02.010
We're only dating. I swear.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.810
I'm not sure I can take
much more of this.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.730
We'll be okay.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.400
Whatever happened in that house-

30:19.440 --> 30:20.980
The truth will come out.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.280
I know.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.240
I'm really sorry Mal.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.240
What can you be sorry for?

30:27.280 --> 30:28.910
It's my gene pool, not yours.

30:28.950 --> 30:30.570
I should be doing the
apologizing every day.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.120
No, no, listen. I had an
appraisal done on the house

30:33.160 --> 30:34.080
without telling you.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.040
Rose.

30:35.080 --> 30:35.410
It's your house too.

30:36.790 --> 30:39.420
I know you're just exploring
all of the options.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.250
We can't get anymore
equity out of it.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.260
We're basically in a financial
mess if Jake goes away.

30:55.890 --> 30:57.980
He's about to be on the hook for
two murders

30:58.020 --> 30:59.440
he had nothing to do with.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.770
It's a bit hard to swallow,
I tell you that.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.530
I don't know how to help him,
and it's killing me.

31:06.570 --> 31:08.910
He's my best friend.
My son. He's-

31:16.080 --> 31:17.540
[Jake] What do we got?
Anything?

31:17.580 --> 31:18.660
Anything else?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.000
It's not gonna change.

31:20.040 --> 31:20.330
It has to.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.460
It won't, Jake. The evidence
isn't adding up to anything.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.920
Or maybe we're just, you
know, not seeing it.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.630
The day shift's gonna
be here soon.

31:27.670 --> 31:30.130
You know what I could go
for right now?

31:30.180 --> 31:31.220
A nice bottle of wine.

31:31.260 --> 31:33.430
Me and you by a fireplace.

31:33.470 --> 31:34.850
You scantily clad,
lying next to me.

31:36.310 --> 31:38.350
I'd be happy to be alone with
you in a room without

31:38.390 --> 31:39.810
a dead body in it for once.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.860
You could think of it like
extreme dating.

31:43.650 --> 31:45.190
Keeps everything alive.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.110
Pardon the pun.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.450
I won't give up. I can't.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.740
What else is going on with you?

31:57.910 --> 31:59.790
There's something
you're not telling me.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.170
It's nothing.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.170
I love you, that's all.

32:04.210 --> 32:07.300
I just want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

32:18.140 --> 32:19.930
Yeah, you're right.
It is kinda weird.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.310
[Pickard] You're a dirty cop.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.480
I got nothing to hide.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.030
Are you absolutely
certain about that?

32:30.240 --> 32:30.530
[Jake] [on phone] What if I told you

32:31.900 --> 32:32.360
to forget everything Sloan
said to you today?

32:33.570 --> 32:35.120
She was never here.
She never confessed.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.200
She never told you
about me and Saul.

32:37.240 --> 32:37.580
[Sloan] Jake-

32:38.620 --> 32:38.870
[Jake] The safest thing for you

32:40.290 --> 32:42.250
is to get as far away
from Vic Saul as possible.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.790
[Leslie] Jake's right. And if
the Doyle's don't cooperate-

32:44.830 --> 32:49.130
Even if I take your confession.
The charges will never stick.

32:52.090 --> 32:54.680
You had a warrant to
bug my office?

32:54.720 --> 32:55.720
How did you get it?

32:55.760 --> 32:56.850
If I had heard correctly,

32:56.890 --> 32:58.680
it would appear that Jake Doyle

32:58.720 --> 33:01.230
is in the employ of a certain
organized crime boss.

33:01.270 --> 33:01.480
A Vic Saul.

33:02.390 --> 33:03.480
Yeah? That's not what I heard.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.060
Of course you didn't.

33:05.100 --> 33:05.400
This is a witch hunt.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.610
You got nothing better to do
than dig through my trash?

33:08.650 --> 33:11.070
You've known all along that Jake
was connect with Saul.

33:11.110 --> 33:13.610
And yet you managed to keep
that tasty little morsel

33:13.650 --> 33:15.700
all to yourself.

33:15.740 --> 33:16.030
What else are you hiding?

33:17.030 --> 33:19.120
I told you. I got
nothing to hide.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.990
Precisely. What was your role

33:21.040 --> 33:23.830
in the robbery and murder of
Barbara Warrick?

33:23.870 --> 33:26.420
And when did you plan to skip
town with Jake Doyle?

33:27.790 --> 33:30.960
The truth shall set you
free, Ms. Bennett.

33:31.010 --> 33:31.710
Sergeant Bennett.

33:32.970 --> 33:35.970
You know, if I were you,
I'd get used to Ms.

33:39.890 --> 33:40.890
You can run.

33:49.570 --> 33:50.440
Leslie.

33:55.110 --> 33:56.490
It's not safe here.

33:58.780 --> 34:01.950
I'm the subject of an Internal
Affairs instigation.

34:01.990 --> 34:04.450
And you're the prime
suspect in two homicides.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.370
I know. I know. I'm just hoping
that when I go away-

34:07.420 --> 34:08.330
They'll leave you alone.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.090
We still got time.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.920
There's a month 'til the trail.

34:14.340 --> 34:17.260
Yeah. Um.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.850
Seeing how we're all in a
real sharing and...

34:20.930 --> 34:22.390
...open honest mood today-

34:22.430 --> 34:23.470
I gotta tell you something.

34:23.890 --> 34:24.850
What?

34:29.480 --> 34:31.400
They're moving my trial
up to next week.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.200
Which is why they think I'm
an accomplice

34:36.240 --> 34:37.820
in this robbery-homicide.

34:37.860 --> 34:40.280
They think we're gonna run.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.370
How did I end up on the
hook for two murders?

34:43.410 --> 34:43.700
I mean, Brogan-

34:44.870 --> 34:46.460
He kills Clark. There's
on murderer dead.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.630
The murderer is dead.

34:54.670 --> 34:57.550
How many suspects in the
Barbara Warrick murder?

34:57.590 --> 34:59.010
Apart from you,
there is no one else.

34:59.050 --> 34:59.340
Exactly.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.890
Exactly. Barbara Warrick was
alone in that room.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.390
Hey Jake. Where are you?

35:04.430 --> 35:05.390
Are you watching this?

35:05.430 --> 35:06.520
Shut up. I'm in a morgue.

35:06.560 --> 35:06.850
Oh, thank God.

35:07.890 --> 35:08.190
-Wait, wait. Are you okay? -Yeah.

35:09.730 --> 35:11.730
I need you to tap into Barbara
Warrick's security system.

35:11.770 --> 35:12.690
Can you do that?

35:12.730 --> 35:13.650
Use my computer.

35:13.690 --> 35:14.030
Pretty easily.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.900
I'm still logged into the
alarm system from last night.

35:18.990 --> 35:21.910
O.M.G. There's only one active
sensor in the house.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.200
-Where was it? -Hang on.

35:24.240 --> 35:24.580
It's gonna
take a minute.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.910
Tinny was that the sensor
relayed to the Police Station?

35:27.960 --> 35:28.160
Yeah.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.080
I'm sorry Jake. I can't
find the exact room.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.340
But it is in a zone
that you didn't get to.

35:33.380 --> 35:33.630
Why not? Why?

35:35.090 --> 35:35.920
Because Mrs. Warrick- she's
controlling the sensors

35:35.960 --> 35:36.260
using a cell phone.

35:37.380 --> 35:37.590
That was kinda sneaky,
pretty clever.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.130
Jake. No pressure. But you know
I can't do any hard time, right?

35:41.180 --> 35:42.680
And not even easy
time. Like no time at all.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.600
Don't leave me! Don't-

35:44.390 --> 35:45.510
Is that her cell phone?

35:45.560 --> 35:46.430
Yeah.

35:50.480 --> 35:50.770
I found the app.

35:52.020 --> 35:53.310
There should be a list of all
the sensors

35:53.360 --> 35:54.270
in every room in there.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.150
It won't open.

35:56.190 --> 35:57.530
It's password protected.

35:57.570 --> 35:58.990
Wait. It's a beta version.

35:59.030 --> 35:59.240
What does that mean?

36:00.700 --> 36:02.110
It should have a simple code
that anyone can access.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.030
Like 1-2-3-4?

36:04.580 --> 36:04.780
It's opening.

36:06.290 --> 36:07.870
Look at that. She could control
the whole alarm system

36:07.910 --> 36:09.500
from her phone.

36:09.540 --> 36:11.620
There's only one
sensor that's selected.

36:13.420 --> 36:14.750
It's in the room.

36:14.790 --> 36:16.420
The same room that had the safe.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.170
And the dead body.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.880
She tripped her own alarm? Why?

36:23.220 --> 36:27.140
Barbara Warrick wasn't murdered.
She killed herself.

36:36.190 --> 36:37.690
[Leslie] She tripped her own
alarm accidentally?

36:37.730 --> 36:40.280
Or she did it
intentionally to frame us.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.610
But why would she kill herself?

36:41.650 --> 36:41.990
How did she do that?

36:43.530 --> 36:45.370
I don't know. But Dad didn't
want me to go in that house.

36:45.410 --> 36:46.330
Why?

36:46.370 --> 36:48.040
I'm gonna find out.

36:48.450 --> 36:48.660
[ring]

36:49.660 --> 36:49.910
[Mal]
I hope you're crossing-

36:51.330 --> 36:51.620
the Mexican border, son.
Everyone's looking for you.

36:52.830 --> 36:53.080
Yeah, yeah. Listen.
We're in the morgue.

36:54.210 --> 36:55.500
I need you to get down
here right away.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.460
I know where they are.

37:01.380 --> 37:03.430
Why didn't you want me to
run the security test

37:03.470 --> 37:03.760
at the Warrick house?

37:04.800 --> 37:04.970
The government
was about to seize

37:05.890 --> 37:06.100
all of Barbara Warrick's assets.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.260
Everything in the house
was itemized.

37:08.310 --> 37:08.600
Even the cash in the safe.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.100
After her husband died, Barbara
Warrick thought she'd be rich.

37:12.140 --> 37:14.440
But she didn't know her husband
was up to his eyeballs in debt.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.940
So we were gonna be
her fall guys

37:15.980 --> 37:17.520
while she stole all
her own cash.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.440
Steal her own money
and then frame you.

37:19.480 --> 37:19.690
But where's the money?

37:21.110 --> 37:22.400
We're gonna need some hard
evidence to prove this,

37:22.440 --> 37:22.650
you guys.

37:23.570 --> 37:23.820
Shift change in a few minutes.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.160
Last chance. We
need to fix this.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.530
Alright.

37:27.570 --> 37:28.910
So, we know
the alarm was tripped

37:28.950 --> 37:30.660
in the room with the safe.

37:30.700 --> 37:31.000
Hey, wait a minute.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.660
Warrick was an interior
designer.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.630
She had a reputation
for being meticulous.

37:38.210 --> 37:40.000
[Rose] That's pretty shoddy
workmanship, don't you think?

37:40.050 --> 37:41.590
[Jake]
Maybe it's something else.

37:41.630 --> 37:42.550
[Mal]
Wallpaper paste.

37:42.590 --> 37:43.470
Under the nails.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.140
Dad. Think about it.

37:49.180 --> 37:53.480
She took the money out of the
safe. Dug a hole in the wall-

37:53.520 --> 37:55.730
And that's where she
stashed the cash.

37:55.770 --> 37:57.350
But what was her
plan after that?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.560
Well, she didn't plan to leave.

37:58.610 --> 37:58.810
She tripped the alarm.

37:59.730 --> 37:59.980
But she had to hide somewhere.

38:01.110 --> 38:02.360
And she certainly didn't
plan on dying.

38:03.570 --> 38:04.450
Missing heel.

38:05.610 --> 38:06.410
There's a pull rod.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.570
[Jake]
Missing heel. Pull rod.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.160
There's an attic door.

38:10.200 --> 38:10.530
She was gonna hide upstairs

38:11.870 --> 38:13.950
until the police responded to
the silent alarm-

38:14.000 --> 38:17.960
Took you into custody for
the robbery and then left.

38:18.000 --> 38:18.920
Tinny.

38:18.960 --> 38:19.250
Uncle Jake?

38:20.340 --> 38:20.630
I overheard a briefing
on the case.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.090
They're issuing an A.P.B. on
both you and Leslie.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.470
Okay, listen. I need you to get
back to the crime scene,

38:26.510 --> 38:26.720
if you can manage it.

38:28.010 --> 38:30.090
I think so. All their focus
is on you two..

38:30.140 --> 38:32.220
We're looking for the missing
heal of a woman's shoe.

38:32.260 --> 38:33.270
Check the attic stairs.

38:33.310 --> 38:34.310
Okay.

38:35.480 --> 38:35.770
It's a theory.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.650
We all need to go upstairs.
No choice.

38:49.030 --> 38:49.370
[Jake] Let me guess.

38:50.820 --> 38:53.580
You found the heel wedged
in the pull down staircase.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.920
Yes, Constable Doyle said you
told her it would be here.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.250
What can I say?

38:59.290 --> 39:01.080
I'm deadly at my job.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.090
Look at him, la.

39:02.130 --> 39:03.800
Right jealous, he is.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.800
You're either all very innocent,
or very guilty.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.090
Nobody killed Barbara Warrick.
She killed herself.

39:10.140 --> 39:10.430
And how did she manage that?

39:12.010 --> 39:13.930
She hired the Doyles so she
could set them up last night.

39:14.770 --> 39:15.060
[Jake] She staged the room

39:16.230 --> 39:17.680
to make it look like
it was a break in.

39:17.730 --> 39:18.020
She left the safe open.

39:19.480 --> 39:22.110
She took all the cash
and she stuck it in the wall.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.940
Read the Coroner's Report,
you douche.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.780
There was a bunch of white stuff
under her fingernails.

39:29.820 --> 39:30.990
Wallpaper glue.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.670
Get me the Coroner's findings.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.210
We shall see.

39:53.970 --> 39:56.010
I know why you did it.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.020
Super smart. As always.

39:58.980 --> 39:59.350
Do what?

40:00.480 --> 40:01.690
You told him that we
were just dating.

40:01.730 --> 40:04.270
And not in a serious,

40:04.310 --> 40:06.150
deeply committed relationship,
which of course we are.

40:06.190 --> 40:08.030
I told him the truth, Des.

40:08.070 --> 40:11.910
Yeah. And the truth is that we
we're in this serious,

40:11.950 --> 40:15.030
deeply committed
relationship.

40:15.070 --> 40:17.580
With mutual respect
and admiration.

40:17.620 --> 40:21.460
I'm not sure what kind of
relationship this is.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.370
What?

40:24.000 --> 40:27.170
I don't know why, but-

40:27.210 --> 40:28.760
I feel we're rushing into this.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.260
No. No. No. We're not.

40:34.590 --> 40:35.850
I just need some time.

40:45.150 --> 40:47.980
Hey. What just happened?

40:49.820 --> 40:51.030
You okay?

40:52.530 --> 40:53.410
I dunno.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.660
Okay. Okay.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.870
You were right about the
wallpaper glue.

41:02.910 --> 41:03.210
But what about the alarm?

41:04.750 --> 41:07.090
She had an app on her phone.
Barbara turned on a sensor.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.420
In the house.
One particular one.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.090
The one in the room
with the safe.

41:11.130 --> 41:12.510
Which she tripped herself.

41:12.550 --> 41:12.840
[Jake]
When the alarm went off-

41:14.050 --> 41:15.760
She pulled down the
stairs to the attic.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.970
And, well, the rest is history.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.980
Broke her heel. Fell.

41:22.390 --> 41:24.020
[Jake] Pickard. How much you
wanna bet that the blood

41:24.060 --> 41:26.810
on the staircase
matches her wound, directly?

41:26.860 --> 41:27.060
Pick a number.

41:28.730 --> 41:30.530
I'm actually kinda broke. So if
you could make it a high one-

41:30.570 --> 41:31.490
That would be deadly.

41:31.530 --> 41:31.740
Wait. I just need to-

41:32.900 --> 41:34.910
Act like a cop instead
of hunting one?

41:34.950 --> 41:36.410
Yeah. You do.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.450
[Jake]
Listen.

41:37.490 --> 41:37.740
When you find out

41:38.990 --> 41:40.290
that everything we just told you
is correct-

41:40.330 --> 41:42.540
We'll expect an apology.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.370
Oh, and be a doll, will ya?

41:44.410 --> 41:45.670
Put it in writing.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.290
Wait a minute.

41:48.290 --> 41:51.590
The blood test
on Jerry Warrick-

41:51.630 --> 41:55.930
confirmed the presence of enough
cardio glycosides from a lily

41:55.970 --> 41:57.340
to prove that he was poisoned.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.390
Philip Miles?

41:59.430 --> 42:02.640
He was so freaked out

42:02.680 --> 42:05.350
that Barbara Warrick was gonna
cut him out of his plans-

42:05.390 --> 42:06.810
that he confessed
that she told him

42:07.810 --> 42:09.060
she was gonna
frame the Doyles.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.110
He didn't know she was dead.

42:11.150 --> 42:16.200
Well, we needed the confession
first. And we got it.

42:16.240 --> 42:20.830
Ha. Good job.

42:20.870 --> 42:22.240
One murder rap down.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.870
And one to go.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.630
Yeah. I need that Internal
Affairs report

42:35.670 --> 42:36.720
on Sergeant Bennett.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.890
As fast as you can get it to me.
