00:01.001 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

00:03.545 --> 00:06.548
Oh, no! There used
to be a crystal in here. It's gone.

00:06.631 --> 00:09.217
Until we find it,
you're stuck here being Harper.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.112
Whatever you normally do,
Harper will cover for you

00:11.136 --> 00:12.216
until you guys switch back.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.805
Harper, are you feeling okay?

00:13.888 --> 00:15.765
Yes. I think I'm just...

00:15.849 --> 00:17.142
Having a rough day?

00:17.225 --> 00:18.995
- What game are you playing?
- It's a spirit board.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.330
We're trying to contact the ghost
who pulled down the wallpaper.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.814
- It's her!
- The ghost.

00:22.897 --> 00:23.958
The lady we saw through the window.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.818
Her name is Mrs. Barker.
She's definitely not a ghost.

00:26.901 --> 00:30.196
My friend Savannah just sent me a picture,
and I need you to take a look at it.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.157
It's the maintenance man
at the hotel in 1962.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.241
His name is Sam.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.452
"Help. Stuck in 1930."

00:35.535 --> 00:37.120
Hang on, Harper. I'm coming.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.122
- Who said you could touch that?
- Sam.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.666
What if somehow,
he's the key to all of this?

00:44.461 --> 00:46.254
No!

00:57.307 --> 00:58.600
I'm sorry, okay?

00:59.309 --> 01:01.144
I never should've taken that thing.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.438
I was gonna put it back. I swear!

01:04.856 --> 01:06.191
Forget this!

01:53.697 --> 01:56.324
Daisy, there might be a way
we could get the portal working again.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.951
A way that involves your brother.

01:58.034 --> 02:02.330
How? Sam is only a child,
or he was when I last saw him.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.558
Yeah, but when he grows up,
he turns the radio into a time machine.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.834
I-I'm sure of it.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.477
We just need to find out how he did it.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.546
Do you remember him
working on anything like that?

02:09.629 --> 02:11.691
He showed me sketches
of all his contraptions, but...

02:11.715 --> 02:13.091
Could you recreate them?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.010
I don't know.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
Even if I remember the images correctly,

02:16.886 --> 02:19.305
I could never put together
how Sam's invention works.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.891
He's the genius, not me.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.228
I'm going to be
stuck here forever, aren't I?

02:25.311 --> 02:28.565
No. We'll get you back, Daisy.
One way or another.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.067
- How can you be so certain?
- Because, if we don't,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.254
then you'll never grow up in the '30s
like you're supposed to.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.405
You'll never have kids.
Harper will never be born.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.657
Just, trust me,
we can't mess with time like that.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.801
And besides, there's no way

02:38.825 --> 02:41.119
I'm leaving Harper
stranded all alone back there.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.788
You really care for her, don't you?

02:43.872 --> 02:44.873
Yeah.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.022
It has to be here somewhere.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.612
You are not supposed to be here.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.739
You built this?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.408
Oh, my gosh! I have so many questions.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.243
- This radio...
- Is an old piece of junk.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.162
Just like everything else
in this basement.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.705
It is not a toy.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.100
- Well, trust me, I know that, but...
- No… No!

03:28.124 --> 03:30.126
What you've been doing
is you've been snooping.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.878
I've seen you follow me around the hotel.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.130
Well, I haven't been snooping.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.135
Okay, well, maybe I have,
but can you blame me?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.888
I saw you coming out of a secret room

03:41.971 --> 03:44.224
and then collecting all those cables
in the barn.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.394
I thought you were up to something,
and I was right.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.396
You're building a time machine.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.113
That's a good one!

03:59.531 --> 04:01.971
You know, I think you're reading
a little too much H.G. Wells.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.619
Now, I love a good story.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.263
- Why don't you try...
- It's not a story.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.915
You don't have to lie, Sam. Not to me.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.875
I know what this radio really is.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.961
Or at least what it will be.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.504
I've used it.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.219
Who put you up to this?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.722
Another counselor? A camper?

04:24.848 --> 04:26.474
I've heard what they call me.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.684
Moss Man.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.063
I guess I'm just a perfect target
for this kind of prank.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.776
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have real work to do.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.321
- But...
- Go on.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.920
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.636
He didn't even go inside.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.638
It's almost like he doesn't want the job.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.098
I don't think he does.

05:07.182 --> 05:11.644
Whoa. All this just to replace
a few leaky pipes?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.808
There's gotta be another plumber
in town we can call.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.399
None that'll come out here.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.044
As soon as they heard the word "Tremont,"

05:18.068 --> 05:20.228
it's like they couldn't
get off the phone quick enough.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.281
You know, once we fix it up,

05:23.365 --> 05:25.205
people will change their minds
about the hotel.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.327
We just need the chance.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.162
- Hey!
- Stop.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.288
Do you hear that?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.548
Hey, stop.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.593
What's going on?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.680
Oh, sorry. Is this your land?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.043
We didn't mean to bother anyone.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.475
We were just hiking past
and saw the water here.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.810
Looked too good to pass up.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.187
The springs.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.149
- They're back!
- We'll just get out of your way.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.277
You don't think all the rain from
last night could've done this, do you?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.361
No.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.241
It makes no sense, but...

06:08.910 --> 06:10.161
You know what this means?

06:11.246 --> 06:13.707
This means business, tourists, profit.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.459
This means our luck is changing.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.177
Topher,

06:26.261 --> 06:29.139
Mother instructed me to tell you
to get dressed for school,

06:29.222 --> 06:32.517
but you cannot wear
your man-spider shirt because it's...

06:35.603 --> 06:37.480
Did you go out in the storm last night?

06:38.231 --> 06:41.943
Oh, I, uh, must've been sleepwalking.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.572
Probably all those gummy worms
I ate before bed.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.115
Messed with my REM.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.325
But don't tell Mom, okay?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.744
Harper! Topher!

06:52.996 --> 06:55.224
We're running late. And if you don't
get your butts in the car

06:55.248 --> 06:57.128
in the next two minutes,
you can walk to school.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
Uh, I don't mind walking.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.587
You don't?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.506
I mean, uh, me neither.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.177
Okay, what's up with you two? Hmm?

07:07.719 --> 07:10.638
Topher, you've got that
"I'm hiding something" look on your face.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.141
He overslept, but don't worry.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.976
I'll make sure he gets to school on time.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.688
Fine, but get a move on.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.526
Have I ever told you
you're the best big sister ever?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.826
Come on, do something!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.079
…so delicious,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.164
you'll swear it came
from Grandma's kitchen.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.334
And stick around
for your favorite serial and mine,

07:39.417 --> 07:42.170
"The Man Out of Time," with Dutch Kelley.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.382
Thought you hated this program.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.175
It's about time travel?

07:48.301 --> 07:51.179
It's about an adventurer
who journeys along the timeline

07:51.262 --> 07:53.139
to prevent the world from ending.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.474
Does he use a portal?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.935
And does he ever get, you know, stuck?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.271
Weird question, I know. Sorry.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.234
It's just interesting,
all this science fiction stuff.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.944
Time travel and visions...

08:06.027 --> 08:07.862
The visions aren't science fiction.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.447
Right, right. Of course.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.951
But, um, are there rules for them?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.703
Do they just pop up randomly or...

08:14.786 --> 08:17.122
Have you forgotten
everything Mother taught us?

08:17.205 --> 08:20.375
Uh… No. No, I remember. Yeah.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.504
Sorry, I must be overtired or something.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.047
Out late last night?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.882
More like up early this morning.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.759
5:00 a.m. with the hens.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.595
I'll never take an omelet
for granted again.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.808
Anyway, um, enjoy the show.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.355
Please, don't hurt me! No!

08:42.439 --> 08:45.442
Please, I have to go! No!

08:45.525 --> 08:46.901
Is that supposed to be scary?

08:46.985 --> 08:48.486
It's sad, I know.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.114
But this is one of the best ghost sites
on the Internet.

08:51.197 --> 08:55.368
If we want more information on ectoplasm,
or whatever caused this,

08:55.452 --> 08:56.953
then we need to find experts.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.831
Especially now that Topher's
ghosting us for some reason.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.416
Maybe he saw a ghost in the basement,

09:01.499 --> 09:03.376
and he's too freaked out
to come back here.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.170
Wish we could see a real ghost

09:05.253 --> 09:07.881
and not just some confused old lady
wandering around the yard.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.400
Just because we were wrong about her,

09:09.424 --> 09:11.718
doesn't mean we're wrong
about the Tremont being haunted.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.429
But this site doesn't
have the info we need.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.473
It'd be faster if we started our own page.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.200
Then we can post all
the ghostly activity we see,

09:18.224 --> 09:19.934
and the experts would come to us.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.436
That's a great idea!

09:21.519 --> 09:24.397
We'll get way more views
than the time we tried the dance video.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.691
I thought we agreed
to never talk about that again.

09:27.192 --> 09:30.153
What are you kids doing?
You should be halfway to school by now.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.363
To be continued.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.994
There you are! I stayed up half the night
searching the hotel for the crystal,

09:38.078 --> 09:39.079
but no luck.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.164
Are you ready for today?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.124
Truthfully, no.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.503
It's a lot to ask,
but until we find that thing,

09:46.586 --> 09:49.047
you have to go to school
to maintain cover as Harper.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.632
You've been pulling it off so far.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.968
Mrs. Dunn and Topher
still believe you're her, right?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.136
I think so.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.681
Though Topher was acting
a little strange today.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
Said he was sleepwalking
outside last night.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.892
In a storm?

10:02.811 --> 10:05.730
Hey, Daisy. It's okay.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.232
I mean, it's just school.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.609
Couldn't have changed that much
in 90 years.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.530
Look, just… sit in class.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.116
Don't talk back. Maybe don't talk at all.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.451
I don't know if I can do this.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.538
Just think of it as an adventure.
I mean, that's how Harper will look at it.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.997
But I'm not Harper!

10:23.081 --> 10:24.416
That's the problem.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.002
I know you want me to be her,
but this is all so much.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.503
My brother invented a time machine.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.171
My mother's potentially a ghost.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.548
I'm stuck in the future.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.718
Everything here is so fast and bright…

10:34.801 --> 10:36.720
…and there's so much beeping everywhere.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.280
I've done everything
you've asked, Griffin,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.682
but I'm still not her.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.576
And I don't know how much longer
I can pretend.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.768
But you have to!

10:43.852 --> 10:45.228
Harper's whole life is at stake.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.666
I'll handle everything else,
if you could just get through today.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.691
One day.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.526
You can do that, can't you?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.177
You're in my seat.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.430
Oh, um, sorry.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.392
Everyone all settled?

11:25.602 --> 11:26.603
Good.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.105
We're starting today with a pop quiz…

11:30.440 --> 11:32.859
…on the material we covered last week,

11:33.401 --> 11:37.280
particularly the events leading up
to the start of World War II.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.656
There was a second world war?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.065
Hello?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.410
Oh!

12:24.285 --> 12:26.287
Who are you? How did you get in here?

12:26.371 --> 12:28.331
Uh, the front door.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.041
Isn't this a hotel?

12:30.125 --> 12:33.670
Oh.
Y-Yes, but we're not open yet.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.797
Ah. Um, my apologies.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.800
Allison Carter, The Sulphur Springs Siren.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.385
Nice to meet you.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.430
You're the new owners
of The Tremont, correct?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.349
Word is the springs
have come back to life.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.102
- Very exciting.
- We think so.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.104
Those springs have
a long history in this town.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.856
Practically legend.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.400
Everyone's clamoring to know…

12:56.359 --> 12:59.863
When are you planning on reopening
to the public?

12:59.946 --> 13:04.325
I, uh, well, we... we have some work left
to do here still, so...

13:04.409 --> 13:09.664
Uh, Allison, I would love to set up a time
for a more formal interview at some point.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.624
Uh, we can answer all of your questions,

13:11.708 --> 13:14.586
even give you a tour
of the hotel when it's ready.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.297
And how soon would that be, exactly?

13:18.048 --> 13:23.011
I've heard from a few contractors in town
there might be some issues.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.306
Oh, just a couple hiccups,
like with any renovation,

13:26.389 --> 13:29.100
but we plan on opening real soon.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.062
Shouldn't be having any more surprises.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.108
Dad.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.240
Okay, let's try this again.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.786
Judge, what brings you by?

14:30.412 --> 14:34.666
I was hoping I could talk you
into reconsidering my offer, Elijah.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.876
I know the amount of work
Grace put into this place.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.838
Since she passed, rest her soul,

14:41.172 --> 14:43.967
you can't deny things have been… slipping.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.220
All farms go through
a little struggle from time to time.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.681
No, this is more than a little struggle,
and you know it.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.476
But I have the resources
to give this land the care it deserves.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.936
So you're really doing it then?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.271
You're selling the farm?

14:56.354 --> 14:57.981
- But you can't!
- No need to holler.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.275
No one's selling anything
right this second.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.446
You gotta understand,
this farm is theirs as much as mine.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.282
I want this place
to always be here for 'em.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.867
For their children too.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.951
I understand.

15:10.035 --> 15:13.079
What if I buy half the property?
The farm and the springs.

15:13.663 --> 15:14.664
You keep the house.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.126
You and your family
can stay on the land, on my word.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.836
I need time to think.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.421
Not too much, I hope.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.758
You know how quickly
things can go wrong on a farm.

15:24.841 --> 15:25.842
One bad season,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.510
heck, one bad accident,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.472
and all you'll leave your children with
is a mountain of debt.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.265
Hope to hear your answer soon.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.609
We can't sell the land,
even if we get to keep the house.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.860
It's not right.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.111
What would Mother say?

15:46.196 --> 15:47.405
Wish I knew.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.950
Sam, do you trust that man?

15:52.327 --> 15:54.329
Sometimes, I don't know who to trust.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.092
You get settled in okay upstairs?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.470
Uh, yes, thank you.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.099
I'm sorry I interrupted your meeting
with that reporter.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.060
Hopefully, she'll come back when
we're actually ready for the publicity.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.063
She will.
It's impressive, what you're doing here.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.983
I didn't expect to hear that,

16:24.067 --> 16:26.861
considering
how you felt on your last visit.

16:26.945 --> 16:27.946
I know.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.782
I'm sorry for what I said then, Bennett.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.910
And since you told me
what really happened to Savannah,

16:34.703 --> 16:35.704
I, um…

16:36.371 --> 16:39.124
Well, I've been reevaluating some things.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.419
And I don't think
I've always been the father

16:42.502 --> 16:43.795
that you've needed me to be.

16:45.213 --> 16:49.426
And I'd like to make up for my last visit.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.511
But more than that,

16:51.594 --> 16:53.805
I want to help you
bring this place back to life.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.890
I…

16:56.891 --> 16:58.601
I... I don't know what to say.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.729
Say you'll accept my help.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.399
The springs coming back,
that changes things.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.901
And with the right amount of attention,

17:06.985 --> 17:10.947
this... this place could actually be
a real investment opportunity.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.532
Ah.

17:13.992 --> 17:14.993
Should've guessed.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.413
I appreciate the offer, Dad, but...

17:18.496 --> 17:21.624
It's definitely something
for us to discuss.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.084
What's to discuss?

17:23.168 --> 17:25.528
With just a few phone calls,
I'll have a dozen workers over.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.675
Are... Are you okay?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.179
Huh. Must've been
an electrical surge or something.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.722
Dad, you're sure you're all right?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.515
That was no electrical surge.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.602
No way! I think our ghost
is getting really ticked off.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.482
You wanted to see me after school, ma'am?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.692
Harper, yes. Thank you for coming.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.361
Have a seat.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.242
Anything you would like to share with me?

17:56.326 --> 17:57.327
What?

17:58.912 --> 18:01.331
You got every single question
on the quiz wrong.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.125
The ones you bothered to fill in, that is.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.502
It's not like you at all.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.173
Uh, I know it's not. Am I in trouble?

18:10.256 --> 18:13.218
You're not here for punishment.
You're here because I'm concerned.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.137
Are you having trouble with school?

18:16.680 --> 18:17.931
Or at home?

18:18.682 --> 18:21.226
If you tell me, I might be able to help.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.106
You could help me? Really?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.983
- Of course.
- Okay.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.779
The truth is, I'm not who you think I am.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.253
Sam, there you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.213
Look, I don't have time for more nonsense.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.924
You have plenty of time.
You have a whole time machine.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.093
Oh, and I need you to finish building it
right now.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.154
My friend's trapped in 1930,
and she needs my help.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.513
Okay. Okay.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.058
You have quite the imagination.
I give you that, but...

19:02.142 --> 19:03.977
No! You have to listen!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.021
I've been trying to think

19:06.104 --> 19:08.481
how I can prove to you
I've traveled through time,

19:09.482 --> 19:10.692
but all I have is this.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.244
"Guys, help. I'm stuck in 1930,
and the hatch is gone.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.747
I'm trying my best pretending to be…

19:25.248 --> 19:26.416
Daisy."

19:27.751 --> 19:29.127
Daisy's my sister's name.

19:30.253 --> 19:34.049
Yeah, Harper, my friend,
looks just like her.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.633
She's related to you, actually.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.594
So you should care about saving her too.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.265
"Pretending to be Daisy."

19:42.891 --> 19:44.893
I know, um, it... it's confusing, but...

19:44.976 --> 19:45.977
No, no. This...

19:46.686 --> 19:49.105
This might actually answer some questions.

19:51.066 --> 19:54.652
Questions I've had
for a very long, long time.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.411
Grace?

20:04.913 --> 20:06.706
I could really use another message.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.501
I think I know why you sent me here now.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.896
Does it have something to do
with what I saw in my visions,

20:11.920 --> 20:13.546
or maybe that judge guy?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.925
Are you there?

20:17.008 --> 20:18.885
Or am I literally just talking to myself?

20:29.437 --> 20:30.855
What are you doing in here?

20:32.941 --> 20:34.150
Sam, you scared me.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.610
I'm just...

20:35.694 --> 20:37.404
I'm, uh…

20:39.155 --> 20:40.782
Coming up with another lie?

20:41.991 --> 20:43.827
You've been acting so strange lately,

20:44.411 --> 20:45.995
not knowing things you're supposed to,

20:46.079 --> 20:47.247
saying funny words.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.250
And now, barely caring
that Papa might sell the farm.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.210
- Sam...
- And I saw you digging

20:52.293 --> 20:53.545
in the clearing last night.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.716
I don't know what you were up to,
but I do know one thing for sure.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.094
You're not my sister.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.931
So who are you
and where did you come from?

21:46.139 --> 21:48.224
Next time on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

21:48.308 --> 21:50.477
We've both used your machine. Daisy too.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.204
I think I have an idea
to get it up and running.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.457
It's some kind of weird rock.
Why don't you guys do some research?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.107
Oh, no! We broke it.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.651
Let's work together.
Save your sweet mother's farm.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.904
Everything the judge said is right here.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.239
What do you mean?
You're not who I think you are?

22:03.323 --> 22:04.824
Once this hotel is done,

22:04.908 --> 22:06.761
everyone in town will forget
all about that ghost business.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.203
Oh!

22:08.286 --> 22:09.722
Topher told you he was sleepwalking?

22:09.746 --> 22:10.890
He's gotta be hiding something.

22:10.914 --> 22:11.998
Hello?
