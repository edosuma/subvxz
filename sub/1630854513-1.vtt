00:08.600 --> 00:11.960
This film is inspired
by the life of Lucio Urtubia.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.720
Some names have been changed

00:13.800 --> 00:18.640
and some events and characters have been
altered or created for dramatic purposes.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.640
"Robbing a bank is a crime,
but founding one is even more so."

00:35.000 --> 00:37.400
PARIS AIRPORT

00:46.680 --> 00:47.640
Good luck in there.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.920
ENTRANCE

01:23.280 --> 01:25.360
Hello,
my name is Lucio Urtubia.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.120
Shit, shit!

01:50.760 --> 01:52.920
-What's wrong?
-I think you got ratted on.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.600
I what?

01:54.680 --> 01:56.760
The police are outside.
Do you have the money?

01:56.840 --> 01:58.320
Yes. Oh, shit.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.640
Have you seen this man?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.160
It's Inspector Costello.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.880
Where are you?

02:14.960 --> 02:17.080
-There!
-We've been spotted.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.440
-That son of a bitch.
-He won't get away again.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.120
Stop!

02:24.200 --> 02:26.200
What do we do?
What's the plan?

04:07.800 --> 04:08.920
You! Stop!

04:11.560 --> 04:12.920
I think you're mistaken.

04:13.480 --> 04:18.040
A MAN OF ACTION

04:21.360 --> 04:25.440
20 YEARS EARLIER

04:33.720 --> 04:35.000
Stop, thief!

04:36.280 --> 04:37.240
Oh!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.280
You little bastard!

05:02.040 --> 05:03.080
Lucio!

05:07.960 --> 05:08.880
Lucio!

05:16.440 --> 05:17.280
Papa.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.960
I can't take it anymore, son.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.800
It hurts so much, you have no idea.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.120
Lucio,

05:29.920 --> 05:32.240
do you understand
what I'm asking you to do?

05:34.480 --> 05:36.760
Listen, my son,
you're the only one that can do this.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.880
The only one that has the balls
to do what I need.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.520
Oh, God!

05:58.600 --> 06:00.320
BANK

06:04.480 --> 06:07.760
Hey, Urtubia. How's your father?
He better at all?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.120
Soon he'll be dead.

06:09.920 --> 06:10.760
Oh, dear boy.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.640
That's life.
We'll all have our moment too.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.560
Tonight, I'll pray.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.960
We don't need
more prayers right now, sir.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.040
We need money
to buy him some morphine,

06:19.120 --> 06:20.480
so he won't suffer.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.840
You know we'd love to assist you,
like I told your mother, it's impossible.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.560
We can't provide money
without a guarantee.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.520
You've got plenty of cash here.
But 5,000 to buy morphine's too much?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.720
This is a bank, okay?
This isn't a charity.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.520
I'll work the harvest during the summer.
You'll get every cent we owe.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.040
My father's in so much pain.
Please help him.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.840
Sorry, Urtubia, but the promise
of a child isn't sufficient.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.720
Especially the son of a republican.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.440
Urtubia…

07:05.000 --> 07:06.360
Just go home now, okay kid?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.640
Take me with you, Satur.

08:03.320 --> 08:06.480
Lucio, no matter what, you can't leave
until you've served in the military.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.920
Yeah, but I need to leave.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.160
-I'll go to Paris with you.
-Yeah, but it's not a vacation.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.080
-I have to work now. As a maid.
-So then maybe I'll work.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.480
Staying here makes us all remain poor,
so we'll never be free.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.040
Do your military service,
and when you get out of there,

08:23.120 --> 08:25.000
please come see me. Okay?

08:31.240 --> 08:35.680
10 YEARS LATER

09:14.600 --> 09:16.320
-Saturnina!
-Lucio?

09:18.520 --> 09:19.520
Wow, look at you!

09:20.400 --> 09:23.000
We used some buckets
to smuggle the stuff out of the place.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.160
Blankets, boots too. We grabbed tools…
Plenty to steal in the military.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.760
We'd cover everything with food scraps,
and we smuggled it with garbage bags.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.840
-You have crazy ideas.
-I like crazy ideas.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.800
These ideas make trouble for you.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.600
End up leaving that army
with peanuts to go and fight for Logroño.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.200
Screw everyone there.
Someone ratted us out anyway.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.560
So the police got my team
locked away in military prison.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.640
-But I managed to escape.
-Go back to them, please.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.000
No way!

09:46.080 --> 09:48.840
They don't like deserters.
I'd be imprisoned, I might be killed.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.280
You could go there and fix things.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.360
No, I'll never go there again.
I hate the military.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.960
I hate orders
and singing "Cara al Sol" all day.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.520
Darling, it's me.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.440
Hello.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.360
Patrick, this is my brother, Lucio.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.400
Lucio,
this is my husband, Patrick.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.080
Pleased to meet you.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.040
He makes the prints
at the Mint now.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.600
-Think the Mint would hire me?
-Uh…

10:12.680 --> 10:15.760
You have to be a qualified specialist
to work there, you know.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.920
But I have a buddy. He works as a foreman.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.360
Can we trust him?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.560
-What'd he ask?
-If you're trustworthy.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.840
Yeah, very trustworthy.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.360
-He's my brother.
-Alright, well I'll speak to my buddy.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.280
Okay, hey kid. You're making us look bad.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.160
The days are very long.
Why don't you slow down a bit?

11:08.880 --> 11:10.760
But a slow pace just makes me tired.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.880
Well at least take a lighter load then.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.920
Understand? What, are you deaf?

11:19.560 --> 11:20.840
No, I hear fine, do you?

11:23.040 --> 11:25.680
Alright, listen.
There's rules in this place.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.160
Created by the people here the longest.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.160
Germinal is the oldest one here.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.800
You all can do what you want,
I'll do the same, alright?

11:59.560 --> 12:02.480
Republicans,
socialists, progressives,

12:02.560 --> 12:06.480
Stalinists, Trotskyists,
anarcho-syndicalists…

12:06.560 --> 12:08.040
We couldn't band together at all.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.840
We never stood a chance
of winning that war.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.600
I remember when we had that big fight
with the PC.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.760
To see who'd keep all that stuff we took.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.240
-Those munitions we grabbed in Mieres!
-That's great.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.280
I had many ties
to the Catalan Progressives,

12:21.360 --> 12:23.800
the Independent Syndicalists
and their party after,

12:23.880 --> 12:25.040
and finally, in the Esquerra.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.680
And you? What're you?

12:28.840 --> 12:30.120
-Hm?
-What are you?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.000
Don't know.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.280
You must be something.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.880
Well, communist, I suppose.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.200
Communist, he says.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.480
-You don't like getting ordered, right?
-Hm.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.920
You're an anarchist.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.320
Anarchist?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.080
And what's that?

12:52.360 --> 12:55.440
CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
OF THE CLICHY ANARCHIST ASSOCIATION

12:55.520 --> 12:57.760
-Time to work!
-Go ahead. I'll be there.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.960
Here, comrade. Thank you.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
Let's hit it.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.320
Look, Lucio. This is Bakunin.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.840
Along with Proudhon and Kropotkin,
he formed the basic ideas of anarchism.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.360
No religion, no state.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.000
Liberty, then work and collectivism.

13:13.640 --> 13:17.040
Here in France, there are some big names
like Louise Michel.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.280
She was the key revolutionary
in the Paris Commune.

13:19.360 --> 13:24.280
She said, "Power is evil and tyrannical."
"That's why I'm an anarchist."

13:25.200 --> 13:26.520
Saturday 30th!

13:26.600 --> 13:29.560
Constituent assembly
of the Clichy Anarchist Association!

13:29.640 --> 13:32.760
Sébastien Faure.
His mission was to create a society of men

13:32.840 --> 13:35.480
who were free and equal,
without government or money.

13:35.560 --> 13:38.240
Money is one of the greatest evils
of humanity, Lucio.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.080
Desire for wealth corrupts the world.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.440
-Next Saturday!
-Hello, sir. What is this?

13:43.520 --> 13:45.160
-Good day.
-Is this yours?

13:45.240 --> 13:48.240
Buenaventura Durruti. He robbed banks.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.880
Banks exploit their workers
and cause inequality in the world.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.240
Durruti said direct action
would be the only way to end injustice

13:55.320 --> 13:56.360
and have a revolution.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.240
Men aren't like him today.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.640
Well, there is one now.
My buddy, Quico Sabaté.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.280
He stole 50,000 pesetas
out of a bank in Barcelona.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.080
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.320
Lucio.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.720
If you deny authority
and fight against it, you're an anarchist.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.760
-Give me the paper.
-It's nothing.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.640
I think you're right.
I'm an anarchist now.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.920
More anarchist than
all these guys together.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.920
Go away! You don't have to beat us!

14:52.080 --> 14:53.160
Ah.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.320
-Is it bad?
-Nah, too hard for those bastards.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.080
Look out!

15:10.240 --> 15:12.440
Chill out! I've driven since I was a kid.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.560
Eh?

15:15.640 --> 15:17.720
Someone tell me what those assholes said.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.920
Lucio, if you want to stay in Paris,
you might wanna speak their language.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.280
LANGUAGE SCHOOL
MODERN LANGUAGES

15:31.160 --> 15:32.960
How are you, Lucio?

15:34.240 --> 15:36.760
-How was your French lesson?
-What?

15:36.840 --> 15:38.520
Oh, nothing.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.080
Will you do me a huge favor?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.960
Yeah, of course, I'll do anything.
Tell me what you need.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.480
Do you have food for him?
The man is starving.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.160
It's upstairs, in the attic.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.680
Here.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.400
Take the suitcase.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.160
You go first.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.800
-You live alone?
-Yeah, of course.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.560
Never trust a stranger, kiddo.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.480
I need somewhere to stash these weapons.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.760
Holy shit.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.120
Who are you?

17:16.880 --> 17:18.960
It's Quico, Quico Sabaté.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.240
-You're Quico?
-You?

17:21.320 --> 17:22.160
Lucio Urtubia.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.600
Have any food, Lucio?

17:23.680 --> 17:26.440
Like bread, or some sausage,
or cheese. Anything would be great.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.360
Yeah, of course.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.840
I have sausage from my village.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.440
Hm. Perfect, kiddo.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.760
It smells good.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.360
You didn't have a lot to work with,
so this is all I could do.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.200
You aren't one of those guys who thinks
cooking is just for women, huh?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.600
Huh? Don't know.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.440
If you choose
to live your life always moving,

17:48.520 --> 17:49.920
then it could be a good skill. Hm?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.440
Did you get 50,000 in pinched pesetas
in a bank in Barcelona?

17:55.160 --> 17:57.680
Well, not everything you read
can be trusted.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.160
Only got 30,000 bucks.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.440
Those assholes always cry
and say I grabbed double the amount

18:03.520 --> 18:05.400
so they get extra out of the insurance.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.560
The same happened to me too.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.280
Oh, yeah?

18:08.360 --> 18:10.800
Took two pesetas out the box
in church, priest says I took five.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.360
They're all bastards.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.640
Priests along with bankers,
same breed of bastard.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.440
Robbing you even when
you're trying to rob them.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.640
Those sons of bitches.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.120
I like you.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.040
Like me, you're a man of action.
Eh, kiddo?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.480
Time will tell.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.800
Listen. I won't make you do this,
you have a choice.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.400
No, I want to, but…
Just I'm feeling nervous a bit.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.000
Yeah, that's normal.
Everybody is first time, my friend.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.800
Just don't let your fear
paralyze you. Understand?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.280
-I've robbed banks before, though.
-Guess it didn't go well.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.400
A few years ago, I tried robbing…
Tried robbing our village bank.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.760
Why's that?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.920
My father, he needed the money, so…

19:02.000 --> 19:02.840
What happened?

19:03.800 --> 19:04.880
It went very bad.

19:06.120 --> 19:06.960
Yeah…

19:10.120 --> 19:11.360
Listen, kiddo…

19:12.440 --> 19:14.600
You and I will be inside that bank soon.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.160
We are more than robbers.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.240
We ensure money's expropriated.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.360
And we'll make it out
in honor of your father.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.640
How does that sound?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.080
Come on.

19:25.640 --> 19:26.480
Your mask.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.120
How do you say, "Everybody get down"?

19:40.200 --> 19:42.040
Uh… <i>Tout le monde al sol.</i>

19:42.120 --> 19:43.240
I think that's it.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.440
<i>Tout le monde al sol.</i>

19:50.400 --> 19:52.040
COUNTER 2

19:52.880 --> 19:54.040
Motherfuckers.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.680
<i>Tout le monde al sol</i>, damn it!

19:57.760 --> 19:59.760
Put the money inside here now.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.760
Hurry up! Put it in now!
Stop fucking around.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.240
Put your hands up. Get 'em up!

20:11.640 --> 20:12.920
COUNTER 1

20:20.160 --> 20:21.720
CASHIER

20:23.400 --> 20:24.240
Hurry up!

20:26.400 --> 20:29.120
Never forget who the real thieves
are here. Yeah?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.680
See the counter? Go there.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

20:37.240 --> 20:39.040
Faster, get fucking moving!

20:39.120 --> 20:39.960
The money!

20:40.880 --> 20:41.720
Come on!

20:44.080 --> 20:45.960
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

20:46.040 --> 20:46.880
Give it now!

20:47.640 --> 20:48.680
Move! Move!

20:51.240 --> 20:52.600
Come on, let's go!

21:09.720 --> 21:11.440
Sure you want to do that?

21:14.920 --> 21:16.520
Go on, go, go, go!

21:22.040 --> 21:26.040
Hey slow down. Slow and steady.
Just relax. Keep moving. Over there.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.720
What do we do? Hop on the metro?

21:30.800 --> 21:33.280
No, we can splurge a bit.
Let's take a taxi.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.600
Kiddo, we're eating fried squid
and onions tonight.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.560
Amazing work needs celebration.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.080
It made me feel
like my heart could just explode.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.920
-I just can't be robbing banks, no--
-Why not? You were stupendous! Listen.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.760
Alright, jumping around isn't great,
and when you open doors, act normal.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.720
We have the money, what now?

22:12.680 --> 22:15.120
My method, divide it into three parts.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.520
The first part is for the movement
and local anarchists.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.520
The second part is for our friends
in prison and their families.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.960
And the third part…

22:26.160 --> 22:28.040
belongs to the ones who did the work.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.120
-Belongs to us?
-Well, of course.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.960
It's money to buy our food,
to help pay the rent for this place too.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.400
And to buy a car.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.720
Because escaping in taxis, not ideal.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.720
-Don't happen to drive, do you?
-No.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.920
I guess we should find a driver.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.760
Hello.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.720
Sir, you can't park there.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.240
Really? I'm sorry, I didn't know.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.920
I'll only be a minute.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.720
Go, go, go, go!

23:20.200 --> 23:21.880
Come on, come on, come on!

23:21.960 --> 23:23.240
Go, go!

23:24.480 --> 23:25.960
We're in, we're in! Let's go!

23:34.640 --> 23:35.800
Watch out!

23:36.400 --> 23:37.560
Go, go!

23:39.400 --> 23:42.000
-You all fine?
-Yeah! Come on, let's go!

23:43.040 --> 23:43.880
Mother…

24:03.040 --> 24:05.120
-Getting closer!
-It's the fastest I can be.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.680
-What are you doing?
-What do you think?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.880
Don't hurt anyone!

24:12.960 --> 24:14.440
Calm down.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.080
Inspector Costello,

25:10.800 --> 25:12.720
there's been a bank robbery
in the sixth district.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.240
Witnesses say they had a foreign accent.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.160
Give him that.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.600
Share it around the neighborhood, okay?

25:20.680 --> 25:22.440
That's how we make lives better.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.200
Alright, Asturiano.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.080
Sir, there were two,

25:39.160 --> 25:42.000
apparently with a Spanish accent
and calling it an appropriation.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.480
Spanish anarchists.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.160
Could you identify them?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.960
No. They had stockings over their faces.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.000
But I think
I could recognize their voices.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.920
Don't worry. I think I know
how to find them.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.640
In response
to comrade Michel,

26:00.720 --> 26:03.280
all of us, the exiled Spanish workers,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.600
will be responsible
for sharing our doctrine to all of you,

26:07.680 --> 26:08.880
our French comrades.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.240
The revolution is not a utopia.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.800
The revolution
is not a utopia.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.920
The revolution is a future
that is still possible for us.

26:17.000 --> 26:17.920
That's well said.

26:20.280 --> 26:23.840
Speaking for the French,
we want good jobs now, and security.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.960
No revolutions and no class wars.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.120
The class war
is more pertinent than ever.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.040
The rich are getting richer.
The poor are getting poorer.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.760
Do you understand her?

26:32.840 --> 26:34.040
Mm-hm.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.800
People's mentality can change.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.520
This planet is in need
of a new order, politically and socially.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.760
No. What we need is
to establish new theoretical principles.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.320
We really need
to quit chatting and begin doing it.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.240
If we want justice and equality,
we have to fight for it.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.520
-That's what we'll do.
-Well said, Lucio!

26:54.400 --> 26:56.800
What does that mean?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.960
Police! Here come the police!

26:59.040 --> 27:00.080
Police!

27:00.160 --> 27:02.880
Quick, we have to go!

27:13.160 --> 27:14.760
Lucio, come with me!

27:38.360 --> 27:42.000
"This is an expropriation.
Everybody on the floor."

27:44.600 --> 27:45.800
Next.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.120
"This is an expropriation.
Everybody on the floor."

27:54.880 --> 27:55.720
Next.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.560
"This is an expropriation.
Everybody on the floor."

28:04.680 --> 28:05.520
Louder.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.040
"This is an expropriation.
Everybody on the floor."

28:10.960 --> 28:11.800
It's him.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.600
At least, I think it is.

28:23.920 --> 28:24.920
Take it off.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.520
Tell me your name.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.560
Lucio Urtubia.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.080
Listen, Urtubia.
This is your first incident.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.760
So you should confess
and give us what you stole right now.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.680
The judge will be nice too.
So you'll get two years at most.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.400
My palms may help.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.200
Covered in plaster and paint.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.480
Nothing more than a simple builder.
I don't know banks, don't know robberies.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.880
Inspector!

29:03.000 --> 29:04.480
There's something here!

29:09.600 --> 29:10.800
What's in there?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
The cash?

29:13.080 --> 29:14.320
Your weapons?

29:17.720 --> 29:20.880
Just some magazines
with naked girls in them.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.280
Besides the Eiffel Tower,

29:28.360 --> 29:30.720
Miss Bardot is the best monument
in France, right?

29:30.800 --> 29:34.040
That's funny.
Perfect, I'll be honest with you.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.440
I know you're my man.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.640
Sooner or later, pal…
You can bet I always get my man.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.680
-Hello.
-Hello, Lucio.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.920
Spoken with Quico?

29:55.440 --> 29:56.920
We hid the weapons and he moved on.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.800
Navarro, come here. Here.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.480
Look. All that's because of you.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.520
Germinal, if banks
are robbing all of us then…

30:10.600 --> 30:12.560
Then we must steal back what they took.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.440
-Jesus, you trying to be Quico, now?
-Is that bad? What's the big deal?

30:15.520 --> 30:19.680
Quico is a fugitive. He's got no house,
no family, and no future.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.840
You really want that?

30:21.600 --> 30:22.880
He's not wrong, kid.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.960
If we keep robbing these banks,

30:25.040 --> 30:27.680
we'll end up in a jail cell
or riddled with bullets.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.280
Care for a bite, kiddo?

31:08.320 --> 31:11.600
These guys have already lit the spark.
They're showing us the way.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.720
Yeah, Quico, but it's not Cuba.
It's not possible to take power like that.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.840
That method requires
a lot of weapons we don't have.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.360
Yeah, but our plan
is to expropriate banks,

31:19.440 --> 31:20.920
what if we rob a factory of munitions?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.440
Let's say you bring us weapons.
Who'll be firing them?

31:24.200 --> 31:26.840
Germinal says revolution
is only possible if we spread the word

31:26.920 --> 31:29.080
and get the people
as a part of our cause too.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.640
To make allies, we need a printing press,
not more weapons.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.840
Now Germinal's turning you into printers?

31:34.920 --> 31:38.120
Well, it's not robbing a bank,
yeah, but still a form of action.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.280
Yeah, sure…

31:47.120 --> 31:50.600
-I'm going over to the lion's den, Lucio.
-If you go to Spain, they'll murder you.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.400
I would rather die
fighting fascists

31:52.480 --> 31:55.080
than live making no difference
putting out flyers.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.880
And you're better than that too,
so you should do the same.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.480
You and I are no different, Lucio.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.880
No, Quico. That's no path for me.

32:09.800 --> 32:10.680
Well then, kiddo.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.840
I'm sad it seems this is goodbye for now.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.080
Here, keep this.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.120
-Quico, not your switchblade.
-Now it's yours, keep it man.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.160
Take it.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.160
-Come on.
-Fucker.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.880
It feels like you've been a father to me.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.160
I'm a father? Not that old, am I?

32:33.880 --> 32:35.240
An older brother, maybe.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.880
Or even maybe a cousin
from your village with the sausages.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.200
A cousin.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.040
-Give me that.
-Here, please.

32:43.840 --> 32:47.960
We just need a loan
of 10,000 francs to buy a printing press.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.960
I'm very sorry, but…

32:50.880 --> 32:53.600
you have no fixed income, and no property.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.400
So, it's impossible.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.320
Sir,

32:57.440 --> 33:00.320
we're honest workers
and our word is sacred.

33:01.200 --> 33:05.120
We promise we'll pay back
the 10,000 francs in five years.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.360
I'm sorry,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.800
but we won't put our trust
in people's word,

33:11.600 --> 33:13.920
only in their finances. Understand?

33:17.240 --> 33:19.080
-Behave.
-Fucking banks.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.200
So you're going into banks
unarmed now, huh?

33:27.280 --> 33:30.400
It's Christmas. I'm sure you
have a lot more things to do.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.960
It's good to see friends at Christmas.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.800
What is this?

33:34.400 --> 33:37.920
I've spent weeks being followed,
can't you see I'm a simple builder?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.160
An informant that we have has said that

33:41.000 --> 33:43.360
you've decided
to start printing propaganda.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.840
And tell me, what else
did your informant say?

33:46.920 --> 33:48.600
That the robberies have stopped.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.200
Not so brave then,
without your buddy Sabaté.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.560
You're not as tough as I thought.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.640
Know who that is? Quico Sabaté.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.560
Oh, I guess you haven't read
today's newspapers yet.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.280
Honestly, it really is a shame.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.720
Because you would look good
in a jail cell. Rotting in La Santé.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.200
But, that's life.

34:13.640 --> 34:16.240
Oh,
and enjoy the holiday, my friend.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.120
QUICO SABATÉ SHOT DEAD BY POLICE
DEMISE OF A BANDIT

34:41.440 --> 34:42.280
For Quico.

34:48.040 --> 34:48.880
For Quico.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.040
Everybody on the floor!

35:01.000 --> 35:02.880
Is that your money or the bank's?

35:02.960 --> 35:05.280
-I just took it out. It's mine.
-Keep it then.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.520
You!

35:10.040 --> 35:13.160
Please don't shoot. Take what you want.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.880
It's an expropriation.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.640
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

35:24.560 --> 35:27.520
9,900. Here you go,
your 10,000 francs, sir.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.440
Thank you.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.560
Madame. What's your name?

35:42.200 --> 35:45.000
Jeanette. But everyone
calls me Petite Jeanne.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.560
Have you been working here long?

35:47.840 --> 35:51.640
Since I was 14, so this is all I know.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.520
Your boss
says you can speak Spanish.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.720
Well, yeah. My mother lived in Cuenca.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.480
We need a person that can work
all these machines, that we can trust.

36:00.560 --> 36:03.120
Well, I know everything
you need to print. Trustworthy too.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.680
Are you sure? Well who'd you vote for then
to be president last?

36:05.760 --> 36:09.040
Bah! I didn't vote at all,
I don't trust politicians.

36:09.120 --> 36:12.280
Hey! I can't believe you're so stupid.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.280
We needed a print shop
and now we have it.

36:17.560 --> 36:20.200
Fine. I'll make sure the place
will be handled by the union, alright?

36:20.280 --> 36:23.160
No way I'm giving this to a union.
This place is mine, I decide what to do.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.800
Who the hell do you think you are, kid?

36:24.880 --> 36:27.720
An anarchist. I don't take orders
or answer to anyone.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.080
I learned that from you.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.640
You're leaving me then, boy? Eh?

36:35.240 --> 36:37.520
-Asturiano, come on.
-Meet you later.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.920
God damn you both.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.440
You will face consequences.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.200
Let's go, Josep.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.760
Do you really think
Germinal ratted on you?

36:51.840 --> 36:54.120
Just trust me, I'm sure he's the one.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.840
Hello!

36:58.960 --> 37:00.520
-Morning, madam.
-Morning!

37:00.600 --> 37:03.080
-Do you have our pamphlets?
-Yes, they're there.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.160
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.840
If you want to be useful, join us.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.120
The more, the merrier. It's important.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.080
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

37:24.560 --> 37:28.480
UNIVERSITY STRIKE
NANTERRE UNIVERSITY

37:28.560 --> 37:32.200
BEAUTY IS IN THE STREET

37:32.280 --> 37:33.640
WE WILL GO ALL THE WAY

37:33.720 --> 37:37.240
Please leave the campus immediately,
or we'll be forced to remove you!

37:37.320 --> 37:40.880
LONG LIVE CRITICAL THINKING
NANTERRE UNITED

37:48.720 --> 37:50.800
The bourgeois revolution was legislative,

37:50.880 --> 37:54.280
the working class revolution
was economic, and ours

37:54.360 --> 37:57.160
must be a social and cultural revolution.

37:57.240 --> 38:00.800
Because we want a society
where men and women are equal,

38:00.880 --> 38:02.720
where men and women are free.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.040
Show us your tits!

38:04.120 --> 38:06.320
Get lost! Shut up! Enough.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.800
Our political system is run by a caste

38:08.880 --> 38:11.880
that doesn't represent us
and so, we, the young,

38:11.960 --> 38:14.680
with our conviction
and ability to mobilize,

38:14.760 --> 38:17.960
can change the system.
We can change the world!

38:18.040 --> 38:20.160
Come on, baby, get your tits out!

38:20.240 --> 38:23.080
If you interrupt her again,
I'll smash your face in. Got it?

38:23.160 --> 38:24.840
Get out of here! Beat it!

38:29.040 --> 38:31.320
-Was it okay?
-Yes, it was great!

38:31.400 --> 38:33.640
-There are so many people.
-I'm glad.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.360
Ah!

38:35.440 --> 38:39.560
-Thanks for shutting that idiot up.
-It was my duty as a responsible citizen.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.240
-Are you Spanish?
-Yes. What gave me away?

38:43.040 --> 38:44.760
A bit too old to be at university, so…

38:44.840 --> 38:47.640
Yeah, well… Well, I read this.
Felt like an invitation.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.160
-I gave you that?
-Yeah, at the printer. Did you forget?

38:52.120 --> 38:55.240
I gave 'em out to so many,
but it's amazing that you came out.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.520
Don't know.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.240
Thought it was important.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.160
And it is. Truly.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.040
-Can I ask you something now?
-Sure.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.800
-Do you like following orders?
-Not that much, no.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.320
Seeing people just get more poor
and the rich get richer?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.320
Well, no.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.120
Leave the campus immediately,
or we will remove you!

39:16.200 --> 39:18.680
And priests and politicians
imposing their ideas?

39:18.760 --> 39:19.640
I suppose I don't.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.480
Well, then I think you're one of us.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.920
What do you think
of joining our group of anarchists, huh?

39:25.640 --> 39:26.680
Uh, what?

39:29.480 --> 39:33.320
We need women with your mindset.
That are idealistic and intelligent.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.240
And are brave.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.480
Run!

39:41.720 --> 39:43.800
Watch out!
Come on, let's get out of here!

40:03.480 --> 40:04.840
Those little fuckers.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.640
It's always in the same spot too.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.160
So you and authority
really aren't buddies then?

40:12.440 --> 40:15.520
By the way, who are you?
I don't even know your name yet.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.520
My name is Lucio Urtubia. Just a builder.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.680
An anarchist. And…

40:24.440 --> 40:25.480
And?

40:26.880 --> 40:29.960
-Do you really want to know?
-Of course. I'm not afraid of it.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.640
I steal from banks too.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.480
-A big fan of Lupin, huh?
-Hey, listen, I'm being serious.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.280
I don't play around,
I don't compromise too.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.920
Everything we make from bank heists
helps the people and the cause.

40:46.440 --> 40:48.680
-Wait, this isn't a joke?
-No, I mean it.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.160
It's your turn. Tell me your name now.

40:52.880 --> 40:57.360
Okay, it's Anne. I study Biology
and want to improve the world.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.000
Mm.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.360
This may be the best apartment
I've seen, but uh…

41:24.440 --> 41:26.080
It must be a bunch of money as a student.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.760
My parents' money helps.
Dad has a business.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.760
So you're petite bourgeois.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.160
One who tries to convince her rich father
to collectivize his company

41:37.240 --> 41:39.200
and to make it better for his workers.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.760
What does he say?

41:41.680 --> 41:44.280
That the police
aren't brutal enough to us yet.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.520
-Don't tell me you don't dance.
-Ah…

41:56.240 --> 41:57.400
I'm good here.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.040
Come on.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.600
-Come on, just move a little.
-No, I can't.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.280
Sure you can, just move with me.
You just gotta move.

42:15.680 --> 42:19.200
Big shot tough guy anarchist,
but women are a total mystery, huh?

43:10.000 --> 43:11.880
The Spaniard
has fallen in love.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.600
Now he makes love, not war.

43:22.840 --> 43:23.680
Inspector.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.560
-Commissioner.
-So, Costello… I hope you've got news.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.760
He's fallen in love.

43:45.840 --> 43:51.200
Great. Paris spends heavily
on fighting crime,

43:51.280 --> 43:54.080
and my chief inspector
has been sitting on his ass for weeks,

43:54.160 --> 43:56.240
costing me a fortune, being a voyeur.

43:56.320 --> 43:59.480
Boss, believe me,
they'll make a move soon, I'm sure…

43:59.560 --> 44:02.840
Doing what? Kissing on the Champs Élysées?

44:03.440 --> 44:07.520
Boss… I bet you anything
he'll return to action.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.400
I've told you many times.
Without evidence, there's no case.

44:11.480 --> 44:16.040
So get off your asses and go take care
of the hundreds of real cases

44:16.120 --> 44:17.280
piling up in my office.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.720
<i>The tension between</i>
<i>the United States and Cuba is rising.</i>

44:28.800 --> 44:31.720
<i>The building of missile launching ramps</i>
<i>on the island</i>

44:31.800 --> 44:34.440
<i>has forced Kennedy</i>
<i>to carry out a naval blockade.</i>

44:34.520 --> 44:38.280
<i>This government, as promised,</i>
<i>has maintained the closest surveillance…</i>

44:38.360 --> 44:40.560
<i>The president</i>
<i>of the US has announced</i>

44:40.640 --> 44:41.960
<i>they will take immediate measures…</i>

44:42.040 --> 44:45.400
The Americans are trying
to put down Castro and his revolution.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.920
There has to be something we can do.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.320
Cuba's a bit far for us to go.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.440
We can be printing out leaflets
denouncing it.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.520
Uh-uh, no.
Pamphlets aren't enough for this fight.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.920
So what can be done then?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.880
You know that you can print
other things here, more useful things.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.960
Do more than our leaflets can.

44:59.480 --> 45:02.200
For example, you can print documents too.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.880
And even fake passports too.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.240
HIGH-QUALITY WORK

45:23.120 --> 45:24.280
What's new, Patrick?

45:26.960 --> 45:28.760
Oh, just looking for new work.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.360
Twenty people, it's so terrible
to fire you so randomly.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.400
Yeah… Can't believe it either.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.040
How about I offer you a job now?

45:40.200 --> 45:41.080
What type of job?

45:41.160 --> 45:44.360
A job that can only be done with
an expert fabricator of bills like you.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.080
Don't tell me
you want to forge francs now.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.640
Francs? Of course not.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.040
We'll forge dollars.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.160
Are you two mad?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.840
You'd have to be complete fools.

46:06.920 --> 46:07.960
We've made a plan.

46:08.880 --> 46:12.640
No, there's no way. That's crazy.
If my wife found me out, that'd be it.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.800
Listen, Patrick.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.160
Ah…

46:15.240 --> 46:17.080
My sister won't be in on this.

46:17.160 --> 46:19.440
And a little extra money
earned every week isn't so bad.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.920
If you'd rather
sit here all day like an old man…

47:28.960 --> 47:30.440
Which one is real though?

47:31.040 --> 47:34.200
They're identical.
Only an expert can make the distinction.

47:34.280 --> 47:36.040
Well it's time to confirm that now.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.240
-Morning.
-Morning.

47:42.040 --> 47:44.040
We'd like to exchange these for francs.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.600
Oh, they're very new.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.920
We're on our honeymoon.

48:13.040 --> 48:16.160
-My kids thank you, Lucio.
-What belongs to you shall be yours.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.920
Come on.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.720
-So you're having a boy, a little Urtubia?
-Could be a girl.

48:54.480 --> 48:55.600
CUBAN EMBASSY IN PARIS

48:55.680 --> 48:58.960
Ambassador, these bills
are as powerful as a nuclear bomb.

49:00.680 --> 49:04.640
If we make millions of bills like these,
flood the world with fake dollars,

49:04.720 --> 49:08.360
the banks in America collapse, right?
Their money reduces to nothing.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.120
Speak to Castro.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.840
Impossible. All our communications
are getting monitored.

49:20.880 --> 49:24.160
Look… In a few weeks,
Che is taking a trip to the Soviet Union,

49:24.240 --> 49:25.520
and he's passing by Paris.

49:25.600 --> 49:26.560
That's perfect.

49:27.440 --> 49:28.840
Then I can tell him my plan.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.360
Hello,
my name is Lucio Urtubia.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.640
The ambassador
is waiting for you.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.320
Lucio, get in here.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.120
You have just five minutes,
so don't push back.

50:05.200 --> 50:07.840
Show all your material,
then share your plan.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.920
Say thank you for making time,
then just get out.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.240
You got that?
Oh! Don't make trouble, okay?

50:13.320 --> 50:14.520
No arguing in there.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.600
Don't be afraid.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.880
A little nervous my head'll blank on me.

50:17.960 --> 50:18.800
He's in there.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.760
-Here?
-Yes, in there. Please head in.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.880
I guess you're the dollar man.

50:50.960 --> 50:53.760
Yes. Today, I can speak for a group
of revolutionaries, who want change.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.720
Comandante, our plan with your help
might be able to end capitalism.

50:57.800 --> 51:00.440
-We have the perfect plan to do it.
-With dollars?

51:00.520 --> 51:01.360
Fake ones.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.800
These bills can be
our newest weapon of war.

51:03.880 --> 51:07.160
They're almost perfect. Only an expert
could tell that they are fake.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.240
Listen, Comandante.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.480
If we produce more millions

51:11.560 --> 51:13.520
and then make the planet
deal with the fakes,

51:13.600 --> 51:15.160
the banks in America will collapse.

51:15.240 --> 51:18.240
Their money will be worthless.
They'd be ruined, right?

51:18.320 --> 51:21.080
Maybe our time to end capitalism
will finally be upon this world.

51:21.600 --> 51:22.440
Yeah.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.160
What do you do for work?

51:26.520 --> 51:29.440
Just a builder. But I have my good ideas.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.280
A builder…

51:41.160 --> 51:42.960
Your plan is a good one, Gallego.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.160
But, well the United States of America
is much too powerful.

51:47.840 --> 51:51.840
Much too rich
to destroy them with fake dollars.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.640
-Yes, but what if we--
-My friend…

51:56.400 --> 51:58.520
A  flea can't be expected to kill elephants.

52:10.680 --> 52:11.840
Motherfucker.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.520
-What's wrong?
-I think you got ratted on.

52:20.200 --> 52:21.080
Oh, shit.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.920
It's Inspector Costello,

52:26.920 --> 52:28.720
-We got spotted.
-That big son of a bitch!

52:29.800 --> 52:31.840
What do we do? What's the plan?

52:39.160 --> 52:40.080
Money!

52:55.760 --> 52:57.160
I think you're mistaken.

53:06.880 --> 53:11.320
<i>Costello calling all units.</i>
<i>Urtubia escaped. Keep an eye on all exits.</i>

53:16.240 --> 53:17.400
-There!
-Where?

53:17.480 --> 53:19.600
There! I told you.

53:20.720 --> 53:23.160
All agents, Urtubia is outside.
Arrest him immediately.

53:23.240 --> 53:26.280
He's by the taxi ranks
and he's wearing sunglasses! Go!

53:37.880 --> 53:39.040
Ah.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.560
What did I tell you?

53:42.080 --> 53:45.480
Urtubia, you can bet I always get my man.

54:10.200 --> 54:13.440
Don't worry.
The first day's the worst one.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.680
But you'll get used to it all
soon enough, trust me.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.040
Yeah, it's disgusting,

54:35.120 --> 54:37.600
but you'll be accustomed to it
very soon, don't worry.

54:38.920 --> 54:39.760
No!

54:45.880 --> 54:47.960
Urtubia, stop!
Stop that right now!

54:48.040 --> 54:51.920
-Charlie! Is it bad?
-No. Fuck you and your mother!

54:52.000 --> 54:53.400
You're a lifesaver, Gallego.

54:53.480 --> 54:55.280
-Come on, go to the infirmary.
-Yeah.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.960
-What's that about, huh?
-Nothing.

54:57.040 --> 55:00.440
Sold fake checks to guys from Marseille.
Huge mistake. The plan was perfect too.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.360
Yeah, mine too, man.
What a perfect plan, huh?

55:02.440 --> 55:06.560
Yeah, I guess jail is full of these plans
perfectly done that fell apart like ours.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.600
Lucio, this is Thierry.
He'll represent you.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.720
-You'll be out of here very soon.
-Is the team out?

55:17.800 --> 55:19.440
They said they didn't know about it all.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.760
The judge decided
to let them out on bail for now too.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.800
Just like they did with Anne.

55:23.880 --> 55:26.600
They haven't made a decision
about you yet, but look,

55:26.680 --> 55:28.400
you don't have a record,
so I think the judge

55:28.480 --> 55:30.480
should be letting you out
on bail quickly as well.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.240
Nothing to worry about. You'll see.

55:33.480 --> 55:36.640
Oh, by the way, I named her Juliette.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
So she's a girl?

55:39.080 --> 55:40.000
Yes.

55:43.160 --> 55:44.640
You have to get me out soon.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.640
It won't be that bad.
In a week, you'll be walking free.

55:58.640 --> 56:00.360
Shit, Anne's had the kid already.

56:00.440 --> 56:03.280
Lucio, please, don't do anything stupid.
You're about to get out of here.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.560
You sound like my lawyer.
I've spent months here.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.680
Well, just relax.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.080
Urtubia. You've been granted
conditional release.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.400
Go on!
Go meet your little girl!

56:48.800 --> 56:52.640
8 YEARS LATER

57:22.480 --> 57:23.320
Payment.

57:27.280 --> 57:29.640
What the fuck is this thing?
Where's the money?

57:29.720 --> 57:30.920
You're holding it.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.560
You can exchange that for money
at any bank in the world.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.680
They're called traveler's checks.

57:35.760 --> 57:38.120
So you hand over this paper
and you get cash in return?

57:38.200 --> 57:41.360
Yes. And it works in shops.
This is the future.

57:42.160 --> 57:43.560
I'd prefer bills to this.

57:43.640 --> 57:46.960
That's what you're getting
this week, Lucio. Take it or leave it.

57:49.320 --> 57:50.920
-This is bullshit.
-Yeah.

57:53.280 --> 57:54.680
-See you.
-See you.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.200
-Is that a cat?
-Yes.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.800
Are you sure?
It looks more like a giraffe.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.800
Oh look, there's Dad.

58:05.280 --> 58:07.760
-How are my girls?
-Perfect!

58:07.840 --> 58:09.160
-Do you know what?
-What?

58:09.920 --> 58:12.080
I scored a nine in mathematics class!

58:12.160 --> 58:13.840
Oh, well that comes with a big prize.

58:16.760 --> 58:19.080
A <i>religieuse</i>! Thanks, Dad!

58:19.600 --> 58:20.480
Okay, come on.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.400
That's 23.30 francs, please.

58:33.400 --> 58:37.520
I only have ten, miss.
Can I pay the rest in a few days?

58:37.600 --> 58:40.120
You know, the banks don't let you breathe.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.720
I'm sorry, sir.
You can only take what you pay for.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.440
But you can pay with this.

58:53.040 --> 58:56.960
-With this?
-Of course, you just have to sign here.

58:57.800 --> 58:58.840
Okay.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.000
What are they called?

59:24.080 --> 59:25.440
They're brand-new traveler checks.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.400
This paper is used
at any bank on the planet.

59:27.480 --> 59:31.440
Even supermarkets too. Hand this paper
to the banker, and they give cash to you.

59:31.520 --> 59:32.720
What an invention!

59:32.800 --> 59:35.400
We don't need to go in
with guns now. It's the future.

59:35.480 --> 59:38.960
Listen, Lucio. Don't go messing
with the banks in America, it's…

59:39.920 --> 59:41.840
-A big risk for us.
-Of course it's a big risk.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.400
-All our best plans are, though.
-Come on, Patrick.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.480
The last place I'd like us to go
is to prison. I hate that place.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.720
But come on, we're anarchists.
We must resist the bourgeois.

59:51.240 --> 59:54.840
The banks, the police, the courts,
they make the workers stay in their place.

59:54.920 --> 59:56.720
They oppress us every chance they have.

59:56.800 --> 59:59.000
But we can fuck them back,
it's our duty to.

59:59.080 --> 1:00:00.320
Especially a fucking bank!

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:01.360
Our duty to!

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:04.640
These checks are much easier
to create fakes for than those passports

1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:06.040
and the documents for ID cards.

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:08.080
But they're more difficult
than forging dollars.

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:11.080
I checked and the prison punishment
for forging checks is minimal.

1:00:11.160 --> 1:00:13.360
Since it's owned privately,
not long in prison.

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:14.520
But why City Bank?

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:17.880
If you're robbing a big bank,
then why not pick the biggest bank too?

1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:21.680
And cashing these is a piece of pie too.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.160
Come on, Patrick. Give us a hand
with the plates for printing.

1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:27.920
Then you're out.
The rest, I promise we can do.

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.200
Just make sure my wife doesn't find out.

1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:38.080
Let's make it happen,
my friends, alright? Time to get to work.

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:45.560
They're perfect now.

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:46.480
Yes!

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:56.800
What are you up to, Lucio?

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:59.000
You haven't been home
for the last few nights.

1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:00.400
We said we'd be more careful.

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:02.480
You know the police
are still watching us closely.

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:06.240
If they put us both in jail,
who will take care of Juliette?

1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:13.400
Look, these are the last passports
I'm doing. It's over.

1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:15.600
You should stop all this too, Lucio.

1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:23.960
Morning,
I'd like to cash these checks, please.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:30.080
EXCHANGE

1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:31.880
Is there a problem?

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:34.920
No, I'm just checking to make sure
the number doesn't match

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.280
any stolen or lost checks.

1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:38.400
Mm-hm.

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:51.080
Well, well, well?

1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:59.080
Alright, so each pair
will have 20 checks,

1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:01.040
and we'll all go to different cities.

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:03.400
Cash 'em quick. For this to work,
we have to hit City Bank

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:05.120
at exactly 12:00 in the afternoon.

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:07.240
The more branches we can take on,

1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.320
the more damage
we'll do to those bastards.

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:13.080
Listen, this is very important.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:15.960
The operation must be
at twelve o'clock all at once.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:17.960
That way they can check
the serial numbers,

1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:19.800
which is written right here.
You all see this?

1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:22.080
We have to be very careful.

1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:24.200
One of us goes in,
and the other stays out front

1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:25.720
to watch for anything suspicious.

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:28.200
This is going to be huge,

1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:31.080
a historic expropriation
that will be an anarchist milestone.

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.480
But this only works if we hit them
together at the exact same time.

1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:36.800
When the checks
arrive at their headquarters

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:38.000
and they see they're false,

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.960
we'll have already distributed the money
to those who really need it.

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:45.160
Your partner will be waiting for you
so after you leave the branch,

1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:47.440
you both can help distribute the money.

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:50.400
Or your partner will let others know
if there's a problem.

1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:55.320
And if all goes well, repeat the plan
the same way next month.

1:03:58.440 --> 1:03:59.520
FIRST DAY - LYON

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:05.320
Well this part's the same as before.
Three parts, yes?

1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:07.280
One part for the anarchist cause,

1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:09.520
then the second part
for the prisoners' families,

1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:11.400
and the third part's for all of us.

1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:13.840
Do you think that share
can also include a few bottles of wine

1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:14.760
to help us celebrate?

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:16.520
Of course, Asturiano!
Get us something good!

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:39.720
BOLIVIA

1:04:57.480 --> 1:04:58.840
It's actually quite simple.

1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:03.880
Their system consists of buying real
traveler's checks to copy the numbering.

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:06.560
They then make 100 copies of each.

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:11.840
Since they cash them in on the same day,
at the same time, at different branches,

1:05:12.360 --> 1:05:14.200
it's impossible to detect the fraud

1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:16.440
until these checks
arrive here a few days later.

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:20.280
Now, this is from the latest batch.

1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:23.880
As you can see,
they are a very high quality.

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:28.720
-This is a massive-scale fraud.
-And what are the French police doing?

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:32.680
They say they're on it
and they'll have some arrests made soon.

1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:35.680
But the checks keep coming.
We will lose millions.

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:37.480
Yes.

1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:40.200
This could be a disaster.

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:42.520
Mr. Barrow,

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:46.000
you will go to Paris to sort this out.

1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:56.560
I understand
your concern, Mr. Barrow,

1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:59.480
but you can't expect us
to put policemen at every branch.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.720
Trust us. Our investigations
will bear fruit very soon.

1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:09.640
I don't know what, uh…
methods you're using,

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:12.200
but those forged checks,
they keep coming in.

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:15.360
We just need to gather enough evidence
before making arrests.

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:16.760
Evidence?

1:06:17.800 --> 1:06:19.120
More evidence than that?

1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:21.400
Now if this were a French bank,

1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:24.080
don't you think some arrests
would have been made already?

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:26.800
Are you accusing us
of not doing our job properly, Mr. Barrow?

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:29.040
No. Of course not.

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.080
-We're all on the same side, aren't we?
-That's what I thought.

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:37.960
So, these advanced investigations,
where do they lead?

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:40.800
Tomorrow is Sophie's birthday.

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:42.200
-Sophie?
-Yes.

1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:44.640
-And do you want to go?
-Yes, please.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:46.720
-What time is it at?
-It's at 6:00.

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:48.760
Commissioner,
been a long time.

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:50.360
Still just doing the daily grind?

1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:56.240
Still a builder.
Done it for the last 20 years.

1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:59.040
These are very well-made bills, you know.

1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:01.120
Um… You know these?

1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:06.480
Like I told you, Commissioner.
I don't do that now.

1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:12.160
And City Bank wants the man responsible.
They want whoever did this in a jail cell.

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:14.160
Daddy, are you going to jail?

1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:16.600
No, honey. He's just asking questions.

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.480
Well look, Commissioner, these banks
are the biggest thieves in the world.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.920
So yeah, I'm glad
they're getting robbed now.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.720
Even better a bank in America.
I wish they'd lose more.

1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:40.400
Sure, play the smart guy.

1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:46.040
Put a tail on him.
And don't lose him this time, okay?

1:07:57.480 --> 1:07:59.040
So that's what you've been up to.

1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:03.320
You should think about Juliette.

1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:05.960
You should think of her too.

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:10.440
If we want to make a better world for her,
we have to keep fighting.

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:13.880
-There are other forms of fighting.
-Are there?

1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:15.880
What are they?

1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:19.160
Doctors of the World
wanted me to join their project.

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:20.760
It's a project in Bolivia.

1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:24.160
So it could be good for us.
So… So, I'd help around the hospital,

1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:26.240
you'd build houses
for everyone that needed one.

1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:28.640
So we'd still be fighting
to change the world, right?

1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:33.640
It's not the time for this, Anne.
This is our best shot yet.

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:36.200
Lucio,

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:39.520
the police can make so many dumb mistakes.

1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:43.760
Doesn't matter, it's no big deal.
But if you go make one tiny error,

1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:46.080
then you'll be through.

1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:55.600
<i>…a massive fraud</i>
<i>which affects the world's largest bank,</i>

1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:57.320
<i>First National City Bank.</i>

1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:00.960
<i>High-quality counterfeit traveler's checks</i>
<i>are circulating throughout France.</i>

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:02.960
<i>Some branches have stopped accepting them</i>

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:05.480
<i>due to the heavy losses</i>
<i>these fake checks are causing,</i>

1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.520
<i>creating customer dissatisfaction--</i>

1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:11.440
You're trying to tell me
that this bricklayer is the brains

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:12.880
behind the whole operation.

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:17.520
It would be easier
if it was the usual gang of crooks.

1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:19.920
Those people are stupid, easy to catch.

1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:24.080
But Urtubia is extremely careful

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.160
and distrustful.

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:29.560
It's not easy
to gather evidence against him.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.720
And how long do you think you'll take

1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:36.600
for you and your marvelous French team
to catch this mastermind?

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.200
A cellmate is like a brother.

1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:50.000
Yeah, six months straight, listening
to his snoring, all the nasty farts, too…

1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:53.920
Not even his wife knows him
as well as you do after that. Eh?

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:57.120
Listen, I bet you if I asked Anne
some questions about him,

1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:59.200
I might be able to answer
better than she can.

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.440
-She doesn't want to know.
-You're right!

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:04.040
-Anyone want anything else to drink?
-Yeah!

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:08.920
If we make an effort
in education, the people respond.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.960
But the foundations have to be laid--

1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:12.480
Please, Lucio!

1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:15.480
I'd like to introduce you to Pierre.

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.640
He's the director
of the Parisian Doctors of the World.

1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:19.200
-Pleased to meet you.
-It's a pleasure.

1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:22.960
He's traveling alongside the team
on next month's journey to Bolivia.

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:25.400
Yes, and I hope
that we'll be in great company.

1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:27.040
I said we're still talking about it.

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.440
Yeah, well it's just…
Everything is complicated.

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:31.920
Yes, I understand,
but I hope that you can help us.

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.760
We need experienced, skilled people
that are committed as Anne, for example.

1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:37.120
Well, we'll see.

1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:46.120
-Are you going out again tonight?
-Yes.

1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:51.640
I really need to respond soon.

1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:54.960
So are you coming with us or not?
I have to know soon.

1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:59.520
-You've already made your decision.
-I'd be crazy to pass on this opportunity.

1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:02.400
I won't make our daughter watch cops
bring her father to a jail cell.

1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:03.920
Don't you understand, Anne?

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.200
This makes a huge point
to the biggest bank on the planet.

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:07.840
No, you don't understand.

1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:10.120
No matter what amount
of money you rob, you can't win.

1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:12.600
But this can prove
that beating us isn't easy.

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:17.600
You do what you want,
but we're getting on that plane.

1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:19.040
With you or without.

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.280
You do whatever the hell you want.

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:25.920
Now… Now there are just
more important things to be done.

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:32.520
People are nervous, Lucio.

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:36.720
Some branches only cash one check a day,
others aren't cashing at all.

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:39.120
They had to stop the flow
sooner or later, you know.

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:40.680
What's the plan for the rest though?

1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:42.720
Thirty thousand more checks
to be sent out here.

1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:44.960
Come on, all that money,
three million dollars here.

1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:47.200
What's your plan?
Because one by one won't work.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.200
I agree, the risk for us all is too much.

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.200
I wonder if it's our moment
to retire this.

1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:56.080
What about you?

1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:03.000
Ah, fuck it.
We need a way to sell it all at once.

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:04.680
A single buyer, one last payday, right?

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:06.840
One last stand, then we retire for good.

1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:09.320
We'll all be top dogs for once.

1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:12.360
Last blow is the best.
Well? Tell me your thoughts.

1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:14.640
Alright then, all those in favor?

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:22.560
Imagine what all this money
could do for our cause, huh?

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:25.520
Our compatriots in exile
still need assistance.

1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:37.480
I'm in.

1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.880
Alright, how are you going to find someone
to buy all these now?

1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:47.080
SECOND-HAND STORE - ÁLVAREZ

1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:51.360
CLOSED

1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:55.480
What's up, Charlie?

1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:58.080
Lucio, what are you doing here?
Good to see you!

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:00.120
Is this a social call
or do you have pawning to do?

1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:02.320
Well, I need a bit of help now.

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:05.320
I owe you big
for saving my life, my friend.

1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:06.560
Please, tell me what you need.

1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.480
Our flight leaves Saturday at noon.

1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:29.560
You've still got time now.

1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:56.720
-Do you have the material?
-We brought a sample, yeah.

1:14:56.800 --> 1:14:59.840
Perfect. Alright, Tony Greco's
waiting over there. Please, come.

1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:11.360
It's incredible.

1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:13.520
It's perfect, wow.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:23.160
-May I offer you two a drink?
-We don't partake on the job, so…

1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.720
Well yeah, you might not.
Why don't you pour one for me?

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.680
-Asturiano…
-I don't know if Charlie told you two,

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:33.400
but, well, I've been sympathetic
to you all for a while.

1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:35.600
To the <i>anarquistas españoles</i>.

1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:39.080
And uh… Well my father
was part of the International Brigade

1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:40.520
in his glory days.

1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:44.160
At my home,
we had books on Durruti and Ascaso

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.440
and Quico Sabaté.

1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:48.920
Sabaté was a buddy of ours.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.280
-Oh, really?
-Mm-hm.

1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:53.520
It's really a shame there aren't more
like you in the United States.

1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:56.480
There, we prefer our money
over having any sort of ideals.

1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:00.320
And so about money, now…

1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:03.040
Well, you know
I'm ready to buy all that you have

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:04.280
if the price is reasonable.

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:08.520
-So then tell us what price is reasonable?
-One third of its value on market.

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.520
Perfect. Get us one million dollars.

1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:15.520
There's three times that amount
in these checks.

1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:17.880
Alright, I need a few days.

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:21.520
Saturday's the latest we'll go.
And not after 12:00.

1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:31.040
-You don't trust the guy?
-I was taught to never trust a stranger.

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:39.160
Go!

1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:53.800
Michel, give me change, please.

1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:09.560
What's going on?

1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:11.320
We'll all end up in prison because of you.

1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:14.440
The police are always watching our house,
we can't escape their patrols.

1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:16.600
It's just always
about your important revolution.

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.240
Other people are at stake too!

1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:20.440
-But this is it, it'll be the last.
-No!

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:23.960
Just stop now.
I'm sick of you getting in trouble.

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:26.640
You can do what you want, but leave us be.
No more plots, please.

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:28.760
Patrick, come on, now.

1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:30.240
Anne.

1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:46.520
Now they're following all of us, you know.
It's clear they know about this too.

1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:48.640
Only we know where it'll be,
along with the American.

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:50.480
The American could be the plan to get you.

1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:54.240
We did check him out and followed him.
Seems fine to me, so… He is who he says.

1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:56.120
Seems the best thing is to stop right now.

1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:57.840
There may not be another opportunity!

1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:00.080
This deal makes money
for so many who need it.

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:03.000
Well then. Sorry, Lucio.

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:05.880
But I can't live my life in a jail cell.

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:07.360
No.

1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:09.920
Goodbye.

1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:24.120
I'm going to go to bed.

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:45.360
Just leave it.

1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:48.880
-Don't make a mistake.
-No, I have to.

1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:50.280
Or I'll just let them win then?

1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:51.360
Who'll win?

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:53.880
The banks. The all-powerful. The system.

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.600
If we don't beat the enemy,
they'll be stronger.

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.200
Just help me.

1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:00.360
Come on. We'll beat these guys.

1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:04.320
You and me, it'll be like old times.

1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:09.400
No, Lucio. It's over.

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:12.160
It's too late now.
Our flight leaves at noon.

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.680
Trust me, time isn't an issue at all.
To help ditch my tail, huh?

1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:16.880
One last time, yeah?

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:18.920
Then our family
boards that flight to Bolivia.

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.480
Listen, the answer's no.

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:24.120
Won't even give me a chance,
you don't listen to a word I say.

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:27.280
Now, here's your plane ticket.

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:28.760
Up to you.

1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:31.960
Juliette will wake up soon
and I need to finish packing all my stuff.

1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:33.920
Alright.

1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:36.880
I'll be there at the airport.

1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:40.120
Perfect. Good luck.

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:09.800
What do you want?

1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:11.080
What are you doing?

1:21:11.160 --> 1:21:12.960
Relax, <i>mon ami</i>.
Take a minute.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:14.880
No, you can't. Are you crazy?

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:25.720
Asshole!

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:49.080
Where were you?
What happened?

1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:52.160
Hello, sir.
What can I get you?

1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:54.640
A calvados, please.

1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:57.640
And for me,
a café au lait and two croissants,

1:21:57.720 --> 1:21:59.240
with butter and jam.

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:02.440
These rackets get me hungry.

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:09.840
Good morning. Thank you, sir.

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:14.960
Get in, sweetheart.

1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:24.560
Don't worry,
you won't miss your plane.

1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:26.120
You'll be fine, okay?

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:31.960
There he is.

1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:10.320
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:20.360
Don't move! On the ground!

1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:49.840
Excuse me, madam.

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:02.160
It's finished, Urtubia.
You gave it your best.

1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:04.320
This is it for you, pal.

1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:17.160
Come on, tell me then.

1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:20.760
Asturiano, Petite Jeanne,
and the American are all in prison.

1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:23.960
The only one
that's disappeared since is Patrick.

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:26.280
No, not Patrick.

1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:28.720
I heard that he was gambling
and owed too much money in debt.

1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:29.840
I guess they used that.

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:31.560
I'd help pay if he told me he needed it.

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:35.000
But after what he's done now,
there's no… There's no words for that!

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.960
Asturiano and Petite Jeanne
got approved for bail, which is good.

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:43.800
But your case though…

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.280
That's more complicated.

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:49.480
Barrow, the head of security
at City Bank isn't playing around.

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:52.640
They're pushing hard
for a 20-year sentence now.

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:55.400
He wants compensation
for the fifty million bucks his bank lost

1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:56.600
thanks to the movement.

1:24:58.360 --> 1:24:59.680
So I'm really fucked, huh?

1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:02.440
<i>Dear Lucio,</i>

1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:05.480
<i>I always knew you were an idealist.</i>

1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:09.680
<i>And a man of action. That was what</i>
<i>made me fall in love with you.</i>

1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:13.680
<i>And I know the fight will always be</i>
<i>the most important thing in your life.</i>

1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:16.160
<i>But times have changed.</i>

1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:19.360
<i>The revolution is a utopia</i>
<i>that belongs in the past.</i>

1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:20.920
<i>We live in a different world now.</i>

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.480
<i>The fight is different now.</i>

1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:26.520
<i>Here in Bolivia,</i>
<i>we're getting to know another culture,</i>

1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:28.400
<i>other ways of helping people.</i>

1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:30.400
<i>We've found a new world.</i>

1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:34.880
<i>Juliette and I are fine.</i>
<i>I think we can be happy here.</i>

1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.320
<i>I hope you get out of jail soon</i>
<i>so you can come and visit us.</i>

1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:42.000
<i>Juliette misses you and, you know…</i>

1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:45.760
<i>I'll always love you,</i>
<i>in one way or another.</i>

1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:47.760
<i>Juliette and Anne.</i>

1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:50.120
Urtubia.
You have a visitor.

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:54.640
The judge wants all
of the summary discussions to be over now.

1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:56.480
If she does,
then you'll stay locked in prison

1:25:56.560 --> 1:25:59.000
until you get your court date,
but if we get that pushed,

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.560
she'll have to let you out
on a conditional release.

1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:03.400
-Is that possible?
-Well…

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:06.440
Here's what I think…

1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:09.560
According to the evidence
gathered and the statements collected,

1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.640
Lucio Urtubia is the leader of a ring
that has counterfeited traveler's checks

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:16.240
from First National City Bank

1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:18.640
and has funded anarchist groups.

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:21.320
We ask Your Honor
to close the committal proceedings

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:23.520
and set a date for trial.

1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.960
The court agrees with the submissions
and the closure of the trial brief

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:30.880
for Lucio Urtubia.

1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:33.680
Has the accused anything to add?

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:41.360
Yes, Your Honor. I call for a mistrial.

1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:46.760
Your Honor, we have found several errors
in the proceedings of the case.

1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:49.080
As you can see in these documents,

1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:52.280
there are errors in the transcription
of the names and details.

1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:56.920
We also have serious suspicions
about parts of the chain of evidence.

1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:01.760
Since the pre-trial detention period
expires on Monday,

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:03.680
we're requesting that our client

1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:06.960
be released on bail,

1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:09.880
while the errors
in the case are being corrected.

1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.400
Your Honor, this is a farce
just to get the accused out of jail.

1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:19.840
I'm sorry, no<i> parle français.</i>

1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:23.400
These legal issues
cannot be ignored.

1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:25.400
He's a clear flight risk,
Your Honor.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:26.520
Silence!

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:30.200
The law and presumption
of innocence are in our favor.

1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:37.840
Yeah, your case
is all over television now.

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:39.360
They've turned you into a celebrity.

1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:43.120
Let us through, please.
Excuse me.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:47.000
Mr. Urtubia,
Mr. Urtubia, is it true that your…

1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:47.920
BUILDER ROBIN HOOD

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.800
They say he is an idealist,
fighting the establishment.

1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:53.560
He's a delinquent.
We can't have him loose on the streets.

1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:56.640
And we definitely can't allow them
to turn him into some kind of hero.

1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:00.320
The judge granted him bail.
There's nothing I can do.

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:04.040
Yes. Yes, there is.
There's always something you can do.

1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:07.600
Arrest him. It doesn't matter what for.

1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:11.920
Invent it. Plant it. Use your imagination
and send him back to jail.

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.320
<i>C'est la loi, M. Barrow.</i>

1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:14.240
Huh?

1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:16.000
That's the law.

1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:17.080
The law.

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:20.720
As long as Lucio Urtubia
remains reachable,

1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:23.320
we can only wait
for the scheduled trial to begin.

1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:25.520
And the judge will issue a sentence.

1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:29.280
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:31.720
You know, you sound
just like those reporters.

1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:35.880
I bet you get a kick out of this guy
robbing an American bank.

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:43.920
THE IDEALIST WHO FIGHTS THE POWERS
THAT BE IS RELEASED ON BAIL

1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:48.960
You! You son of a bitch!

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:50.880
-Hey! Patrick's innocent!
-Hey!

1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:54.120
Look, the City Bank guy talked to me,
he offered to pay my debts, but I said no.

1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:57.000
After coming to you that night,
we chose to book a train.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:58.760
We went home to Mom's.

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:00.800
Okay. If it wasn't you, who was it then?

1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.080
Not sure, Lucio.

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:04.640
Wasn't me, though.
I would never turn against you.

1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:07.640
I'm hurt you thought I might have.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:42.440
Come in.

1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:46.960
Alright, Thierry. What's wrong?

1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:49.320
It was never going to work.

1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:52.000
Tony Greco's a police officer too.

1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:54.400
I knew it!
That proves I didn't get betrayed.

1:29:54.480 --> 1:29:56.400
I should have paid more attention.
Got me good.

1:29:56.480 --> 1:29:58.560
Charlie Álvarez, your buddy in jail,
was in on it too.

1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:00.960
-Charlie?
-Used him to get straight to you.

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:03.000
Not possible.
He wouldn't, I saved his life!

1:30:03.960 --> 1:30:06.200
The man got threatened
with 20 years in jail if he didn't.

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:09.400
So he took the 10,000 bucks
and took a plane to Buenos Aires.

1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:11.400
Oh, that motherfucker!

1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:12.320
Now then.

1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:14.800
Your court date's been set for us.

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:18.480
It's possible I don't go back?

1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:21.480
Lucio, it's impossible
to get out of everything.

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:23.120
Yeah, but just how much time, though?

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:25.000
-Four to five years.
-Four to five years?

1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:28.160
If you're lucky. Ten to twelve
if the judge accepts all of your charges.

1:30:47.800 --> 1:30:48.640
Anne?

1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:53.000
<i>The next bullet,</i>
<i>you won't see it coming.</i>

1:31:17.880 --> 1:31:19.240
It's time we spoke.

1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:22.400
Thought my guys
were the ones spying on you.

1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.200
You're watching us.

1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:26.000
How'd you find me?

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:28.440
Well, I have my sources.
My friends, you know.

1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:30.360
Yeah. Let's talk.

1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:33.200
I'm getting threats,
they're making phone calls.

1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:36.040
And more, I think they want to kill me.

1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:38.840
Why would you come to me?

1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:41.320
How long now
have you known me? Twenty years?

1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:44.880
The best years of our lives,
or so they say.

1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:47.840
And all this time now,
we've always played clean, right?

1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:51.120
I would say I have played
more cleanly, but, well…

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:57.720
If you want me to tell you
who's sending all of this to you,

1:31:57.800 --> 1:31:59.400
I can't tell you because I don't know.

1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:03.440
The last few years,
you've made a lot of guys a bit angry.

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:08.040
My head goes to either the secret service
in Spain, you know,

1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:09.960
or the traffickers
of weapons in Marseille…

1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:11.920
Alright, Costello,
don't fuck around right now.

1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.080
Come on, it has to be tied
with the Americans.

1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:22.480
I'm sorry, Urtubia. But I have to play
by my rules, you know I do.

1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:24.560
Without evidence, my hands are tied.

1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:29.160
Goddamn it!

1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:30.880
Lucio!

1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:36.280
Twenty years in this game playing pure
and then Yankees get involved…

1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:39.480
They believe they can do
whatever they want.

1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:44.480
Well, they can't. Go teach them that.

1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:13.800
The police and the secret service
are looking for him,

1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:18.080
so he'll be arrested within a matter
of hours, with no possibility for bail.

1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:19.040
<i>Mr. Barrow,</i>

1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:22.320
<i>solve this problem or you'll have</i>
<i>to deal with the consequences!</i>

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:23.240
Yes, sir.

1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:02.880
You know what to do now.

1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.920
DE GAULLE'S SPIRIT IS STILL ALIVE

1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:09.320
You think this'll work?

1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:11.600
Better work, right?

1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:26.440
You're awake. So, did you sleep well?

1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:29.240
It's been a while
since I got more than five hours of sleep.

1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:32.760
I'll make my leave soon too.
I don't want to cause trouble for you.

1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:36.400
Please, it's no trouble for us.
You saved my family when I was in prison.

1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:37.560
And we won't forget that.

1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:40.800
Well, thank you, but if this goes to plan,
I'll soon be at peace for good.

1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:42.880
Whatever you need, Lucio. I'm with you.

1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:44.480
-Well, thank you.
-Of course.

1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:51.720
What's up, buddy?

1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:56.120
You're making me nervous, kiddo.

1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:58.360
My dad told me
that you used to rob from banks, right?

1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:01.320
And that you met
and talked to Che. Is that true?

1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:26.440
<i>This is out of control.</i>

1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:29.480
<i>Some of the checks have been found</i>
<i>in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.</i>

1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:32.640
<i>But one batch has just come in</i>
<i>from Mexico. We're fucked!</i>

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:10.360
-<i>Yes?</i>
-Anne.

1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:12.200
<i>Lucio.</i>

1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:14.080
So how are my girls? You both good?

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:16.320
<i>Yes, we're alright.</i>

1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:19.800
<i>Are you? What happened?</i>
<i>Is it true that you escaped?</i>

1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:23.040
Well, you know how I get stubborn
taking any orders.

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:27.880
I just miss you so much.

1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:29.840
<i>What's your plan, Lucio?</i>

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:33.600
I'll fix this all soon.

1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:36.600
And once I do,
I'll hop on the first flight there.

1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:38.160
To make a new life with you.

1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:39.440
<i>But things have changed,</i>

1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:41.040
<i>you know that.</i>

1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:42.960
<i>Is that Dad?</i>
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:43.960
<i>Here's Juliette.</i>

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:47.080
-<i>Dad?</i>
-Hi, honey. How are you?

1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:51.680
<i>Fine, everything is good!</i>
<i>And you? How have you been?</i>

1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:53.760
<i>Me? Just working, as usual.</i>

1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:55.960
A phone booth
in Lafayette Square.

1:37:57.880 --> 1:37:59.680
Did your aunt tell you that?

1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:03.000
<i>She also says that you're crazy</i>
<i>and you'll get yourself killed.</i>

1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:05.880
Don't listen to your aunt.
She's the crazy one.

1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:10.200
Well, honey, I have to go, okay?

1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:13.040
<i>Dad!</i>
<i>Promise me you won't get killed.</i>

1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:18.760
Yeah, I promise.

1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:20.480
<i>And that you'll come and visit.</i>

1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:23.480
Yes, I promise I'll be there.

1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:25.720
Love you so much.

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:27.080
<i>Love you too.</i>

1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:31.360
Tell your mother
that I just miss her so much.

1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:33.520
<i>You can tell her yourself</i>
<i>when you get here.</i>

1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:35.160
Yeah, I guess so.

1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:37.400
I'll tell her soon.

1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:38.840
<i>Goodbye, Dad.</i>

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:40.880
Goodbye.

1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:48.480
-I'm unarmed!
-On the ground!

1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:50.240
-I'm unarmed!
-On the ground!

1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:11.320
Finally,
this nightmare comes to an end.

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:13.880
I can't wait to get back
to New York and eat a real burger.

1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:15.560
You know what I mean, Costello?

1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:19.800
-Well, he gave himself up.
-Oh, he didn't have a choice.

1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:22.240
He wants to talk to you.

1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:24.360
Huh?

1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:36.040
I'm Lucio, Lucio Urtubia.

1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:38.400
Yeah.

1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:41.320
Oh, I won't be offering
my hand to a criminal.

1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:45.800
Okay, <i>Dios</i>!
You're the real criminals here.

1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:47.720
All you do is corrupt
the people and the planet

1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:49.520
with all your money and your wars.

1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:53.800
Your speech over yet?
I hate all this anarchist stuff.

1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:55.480
My only goal here is to be sure

1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:57.720
the company gets
an unbiased trial for you.

1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:02.520
I have a deal to offer you.

1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:05.680
I'm sorry,
but City Bank doesn't negotiate.

1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:09.000
As it would seem like a weakness
and make a bad precedent too.

1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:13.640
Well, I think you'll want
to hear what I have to offer.

1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:18.560
Everyone thinks we should be very tough
on you as an example.

1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:20.800
That is non-negotiable.

1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:25.240
But all my forged checks will keep going
and appear around the world.

1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:27.720
You've got me,

1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:30.840
but you don't have the plates
that I print on.

1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:33.080
So the printing will never end for you.

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:35.720
We'll just go on making our forged checks.

1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.400
Very soon you'll be changing your mind

1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:39.680
when your plates are found
with the rest of your band.

1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.240
You're right. At the moment,
your bank is at the mercy of all of us.

1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:44.240
We'll take a lot.

1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.760
Listen, Barrow, getting the sentence
you want doesn't solve any problems.

1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:51.400
Good point, let's make a deal now.

1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:54.280
If you give me the plates
that you print on,

1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:57.120
we may then accept
a minor trimming to your jail time.

1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:00.000
I'll propose another deal.

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:03.160
I'll give you all the plates,

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.280
I'll give my promise
that no bad traveler's checks

1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:07.360
will show up in your fancy office again.

1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:08.840
And in return,

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:11.160
you'll get rid of all the charges, and…

1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:14.480
Give me a nice, modest compensation
for any inconvenience caused.

1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:17.160
What? What? Are you out of your mind?

1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:20.200
City Bank will never accept
that kind of blackmail.

1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:21.880
Who do you think you're talking to?

1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:26.240
Please think about it. Traveler's checks
are your business' future.

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:28.880
And here in France, many of the banks
chose to stop taking them

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.200
because of all the false ones
that are appearing too.

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:34.640
I guess it all depends
on how you'd all like to appear too.

1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:37.840
-What are you saying?
-If we forge checks,

1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:41.960
City Bank will have to stop selling checks
to stop throwing away a lot more money.

1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:45.160
I guess that's a public admission
we beat you all too though.

1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:48.200
Imagine what City Bank's image
would look like after that.

1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:49.480
Not to mention your bosses,

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:52.320
who'll all see that you're unable
to find a good solution, so…

1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:54.520
Might think you're incompetent,
so you'll be fired.

1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:03.080
Accept my offer and the problems
at your bank will be over soon.

1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:07.000
Just trust me now.
This deal is best for us all.

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:08.360
So?

1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:54.120
Come in.

1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:06.040
And don't worry, everything's in order.

1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:09.120
Well, sorry, but my friends
would say to suspect everyone.

1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:10.880
Especially a bank, so…

1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:14.240
In about 20 minutes,
I have a check-in with my friends too.

1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:17.240
You really have a strange custom
of painting us

1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:19.400
to seem like <i>we're</i> the real criminals.

1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:23.360
There's the amount we said.

1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:27.880
Here you go.

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:39.120
You're not being duped.
There are no fake ones.

1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:50.880
And these are the final batch
of forged checks that we made.

1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:53.960
Can I be positive of that fact though?

1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:58.040
Well, I'll keep my promise.

1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:01.880
Just by your word?

1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:06.480
What's your alternative?

1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:11.120
Look, there he is.

1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:13.800
So?

1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:15.720
-Come on.
-Well? What happened?

1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:20.880
This time, the flea
just beat the elephant for once.

1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:47.960
Ironic, isn't it?

1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:52.720
A simple bricklayer defeated
the most powerful bank in the world.

1:44:55.080 --> 1:44:58.680
We just saved our entire business
for nothing more than a tip.

1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:01.960
Didn't anyone ever tell you, Costello?

1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:05.560
The house always wins.

1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:33.800
SPAIN 82

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:43.560
Hey, how are my girls?

1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:47.080
Daddy! Ah! You're really here!

1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:50.080
Yeah, of course, honey!
Family always comes first.

1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:51.880
You grew up so fast, you're so pretty!

1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:53.840
You really did it.

1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:56.120
You always say I'm so stubborn, right?

1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:57.320
I think you're gonna miss it.

1:45:57.920 --> 1:45:59.920
No, because the fight goes on.

1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:03.800
BANK

1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:06.560
-No, you can't be serious.
-No, no. You know,

1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:09.240
I just think that this place
is in need of a hand.

1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:12.160
We can tile the facade,
walls need painting too, I think.

1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:14.000
That's a good start.

1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:16.200
Sounds good.

1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:17.760
Come on.

1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:27.760
No one knows how much money Lucio demanded
from City Bank for the anarchist cause.

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:30.320
Whenever we asked,
he just answered, "A lot."

1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:32.800
Shortly after Urtubia's action,

1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:36.080
big banks started to look
for alternatives to checks.

1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:39.520
In the mid 1980s,
cards and ATMs were taking their place.

1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:44.160
Lucio was a bricklayer
and anarchist his whole life.

1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:46.760
He published two books,
<i>The Revolution on the Roof</i>

1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:48.200
and <i>My Lived Utopia.</i>

1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:53.560
Lucio and Anne separated
but remained good friends for life.

1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.920
Lucio died on July 18th, 2020

1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:04.640
becoming an idol for new anarchist
and libertarian generations.

1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:44.200
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE
INSPIRATION LUCIO URTUBIA IS

1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:47.800
FOR ALL THOSE WHO WANT A BETTER WORLD
AND BELIEVE A FLEA CAN BEAT AN ELEPHANT

1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:51.400
NO MEMBER OF LUCIO URTUBIA'S FAMILY
PARTICIPATED IN THE CREATION OF THIS FILM
