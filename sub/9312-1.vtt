Hey, Chico,

02:01.538 --> 02:02.998
how's it going?

02:03.415 --> 02:04.875
Hey, Rosa!

03:13.277 --> 03:15.529
You're listening

03:15.737 --> 03:18.115
to "Yesterday's Melodies"

03:18.615 --> 03:22.870
And now for a song that won
the "RHC Cadena Azul" contest

03:23.036 --> 03:24.872
sixty years ago.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.082
"A Little Taste of Me"

03:27.499 --> 03:29.710
by Chico and Rita.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.649
HAVANA 1948

04:28.852 --> 04:30.062
Bourbon!

04:30.270 --> 04:31.563
- Make it two!
- No.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.065
Not whiskey.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.984
Four mojitos, you gotta see
what drinking really is!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.111
Ramon...

04:58.590 --> 05:01.677
Kiss me,

05:02.636 --> 05:07.933
kiss me,

05:09.893 --> 05:13.438
as if tonight

05:14.648 --> 05:18.902
was the last time

05:57.774 --> 06:00.402
Ok, ladies, a toast.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.405
To us!

06:04.114 --> 06:06.283
To us!

07:47.759 --> 07:49.720
Time to switch partners!

07:57.269 --> 07:59.104
Who's your hick friend?

07:59.396 --> 08:00.272
Who him?

08:00.439 --> 08:05.152
That's Chico. Unknown, but he's
the hottest piano player in Cuba!

08:05.319 --> 08:06.862
Oh, really?

08:10.115 --> 08:11.909
Time to switch partners!

08:15.579 --> 08:17.080
Who do you think you are?

08:17.247 --> 08:19.875
Me? I'm Chico.
You?

08:20.042 --> 08:23.295
- Leave me alone!
- Oh, Miss Leave-Me-Alone!

08:23.712 --> 08:26.298
Is that the Leave-Me-Alones
from Santiago or Matanzas?

08:26.465 --> 08:28.509
Try the Leave-Me-Alones
from Buzzoff-ville!

08:28.675 --> 08:33.096
Some girls come from far away
just to get a little buzz.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.642
Be my guest!
Don't let me stop you!

08:37.058 --> 08:39.144
Nah, I like you better than that!

08:40.479 --> 08:43.857
Right! That explains
why you're all over me.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.120
Man, she's just what I need!

08:57.412 --> 08:58.872
Yeah, tell me about it!

08:59.039 --> 09:02.668
No, man, don't you get it? She's
the singer we've been looking for.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.837
With her, we'll be shoo-ins
to win the contest.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.006
Damn it, you're right!

09:08.257 --> 09:10.592
- We've got to talk to her!
- I know where she hangs out!

09:10.759 --> 09:13.178
- You know her?
- No, but I know where she goes.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.681
Those Yank chicks wanna
head over to the Tropicana.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.976
Woody Herman's band
is playing there.

10:04.646 --> 10:08.275
How can I say this?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.864
Hey guys, it's time to go!
Relax.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.449
Wow, Chico.

10:15.908 --> 10:19.203
- Come in, the coast is clear!
- Thanks, buddy, I owe you one.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.954
This is the performers' entrance.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.081
- Performers...
- Thanks.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.750
Get lost!

10:28.086 --> 10:30.797
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.342
dearest music-lovers.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.595
Please excuse the delay
in tonight's main attraction

10:36.762 --> 10:41.099
due to technical difficulties.
We hope to be with you shortly.

10:41.266 --> 10:45.521
Meanwhile, we hope you will continue
to enjoy the tantalizing sounds of the

10:45.687 --> 10:48.106
Tropicana Orchestra!

11:01.870 --> 11:05.999
This is the best nightclub in Havana!

11:16.885 --> 11:18.178
I'm sorry... sorry.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.055
Are you following me?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.185
Me following you?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.604
What are you,
the Queen of Sheba?

11:28.397 --> 11:30.774
Then why don't you leave me alone?

11:30.941 --> 11:32.651
Because if I leave you alone,

11:32.818 --> 11:35.445
I know I'll never be able
to live with myself.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.910
I don't know you either

11:42.077 --> 11:45.706
and yet I feel like I've been
waiting for you all my life!

11:51.545 --> 11:53.839
- I hear you're a piano player!
- The best!

11:54.006 --> 11:56.675
I hope you're right.
Follow me!

11:57.134 --> 11:58.552
What's up man?

11:58.719 --> 12:02.431
The band's piano player had
an accident and he's in hospital.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.227
Hey, wait for me!
I'm his agent.

12:08.437 --> 12:11.648
And now,
what we've all been waiting for!

12:11.815 --> 12:14.484
Straight from New York:

12:14.651 --> 12:18.280
Woody Herman
and the Four Brothers Band!

14:18.317 --> 14:20.027
Who are you?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.404
Rita, at your service.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.240
Coming.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.628
Take it easy, man.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.286
Ok, we get out here.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.040
Hey.

15:57.583 --> 16:01.086
- What do I do with these two?
- Want me to paint you a picture?

16:02.838 --> 16:04.173
Bye!

16:28.822 --> 16:30.073
Bebop.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.368
Be-what?

16:33.535 --> 16:35.037
That's the sound in New York now!

16:35.204 --> 16:37.998
You can play with the best bands.
All the top Cubans are there.

16:38.165 --> 16:41.585
Mario Bauza, Miguelito ValdÃ©s,
Machito. Even Chano Pozo!

16:41.752 --> 16:44.755
Chano Pozo is now playing
with the Dizzy Gillespie Band!

20:07.207 --> 20:10.085
What's that lovely tune
you are playing?

20:31.481 --> 20:33.150
Take it down a key.

21:12.773 --> 21:14.733
- Let me in!
- Not now. Come back later.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.152
Who's in there?
Another one of your Yankees?

21:17.319 --> 21:18.904
I told you to come back later!

21:19.071 --> 21:21.990
No way!
You're planning on taking off

21:22.157 --> 21:24.785
to New York with one of them and
I want to see what the big deal is!

21:26.453 --> 21:28.872
I see, this time
your little friend's not a Yankee.

21:29.039 --> 21:34.086
Get out of here! There's plenty of
men around here! This one's mine!

21:34.837 --> 21:37.589
Was yours!
Now he's my man!

21:38.882 --> 21:41.134
You don't know what this guy's like.

21:41.468 --> 21:45.055
And you don't know
who you're messing with. Beat it!

21:45.264 --> 21:46.682
Go on!

21:46.849 --> 21:49.935
I'll show you what it means
to steal a man from a woman like me!

21:50.102 --> 21:51.645
Hey, watch those hands!
Don't touch me!

21:51.854 --> 21:53.647
- Get your dirty hands off me!
- Bitch!

21:54.940 --> 21:56.191
- Let me go!
- You let go first!

21:56.358 --> 21:57.234
If I get hold of that face!

21:57.401 --> 22:00.529
Let me go!
Don't scratch me, you bitch!

22:02.990 --> 22:04.199
I'll kill you!

22:05.033 --> 22:06.910
You're crazy!

22:09.663 --> 22:10.706
Tell her to go.

22:10.873 --> 22:14.209
Tell her to get dressed and get lost!

22:14.376 --> 22:16.086
Juana, Juana...

22:17.880 --> 22:19.715
Get outta here!

22:21.091 --> 22:22.718
Ow!

22:24.636 --> 22:27.389
Sure you don't have more girls
hiding under the stairs?

22:27.556 --> 22:28.682
Don't worry,

22:28.849 --> 22:32.519
I'm gonna leave the door open
so you can service them all!

22:34.062 --> 22:35.647
Get off! Rita!

22:35.814 --> 22:37.858
Let her go, Chico! Let her go!

22:38.358 --> 22:39.568
Rita!

22:39.735 --> 22:42.154
Hey, you, don't run so fast!
You want him?

22:42.321 --> 22:45.365
You can have him!
He's all yours!

22:45.532 --> 22:48.535
I'm leaving too.
Wasn't that what you wanted?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.497
Shit!

23:06.512 --> 23:07.721
Shit!

23:08.847 --> 23:10.307
What gives, Chico?

23:10.474 --> 23:13.352
You've been chosen for
the competition and you don't care!

23:13.560 --> 23:16.522
- I need a singer.
- I know a hundred.

23:16.772 --> 23:19.149
That can sing my arrangements?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.109
I get it.

23:21.485 --> 23:24.655
You've fallen in love!

23:26.031 --> 23:29.076
That's it, right?

23:36.166 --> 23:38.877
Hey, buddy, only whites allowed.

23:39.336 --> 23:43.382
Look, man, I just want to give
a message to my sister.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.886
If I had a sister, I'd be damned
if I let her work here!

23:48.053 --> 23:50.347
Whatever you say,
you're the boss!

24:24.256 --> 24:25.591
Ok, see you.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.010
- Ciao!
- Ciao!

24:47.779 --> 24:50.616
See you around, Angel.
I'll come by soon!

25:10.677 --> 25:13.305
Good evening, Rita!

25:14.890 --> 25:16.433
Did you lose something?

25:16.642 --> 25:18.602
I think I just found it.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.146
Well, that's good news.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.774
- Got ten pesos you can spare?
- Ten?

25:24.900 --> 25:26.860
Stick with me
and you'll make much more.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.445
Oh, really?

25:28.820 --> 25:30.364
What's your cut?

25:30.531 --> 25:31.698
Twenty percent.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.826
Hey, I don't need
anybody hustling me!

25:33.992 --> 25:36.995
So, beat it!
It's been a nightmare of a night.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.014
Rita!

25:56.223 --> 25:58.058
Rita! Hey, wait up!

26:11.321 --> 26:14.199
- What if she doesn't show up?
- Relax, she'll show.

26:14.783 --> 26:17.369
- How can you be so sure?
- Because...

26:19.454 --> 26:21.123
Look, there she is!

26:34.094 --> 26:37.973
Coming up,
Contest Couple Number 21.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.017
Chico and Rita!

26:59.786 --> 27:02.873
For so long we have enjoyed

27:03.040 --> 27:05.334
This love

27:06.001 --> 27:10.923
Our souls got so close

27:11.423 --> 27:14.468
That I keep your taste

27:15.010 --> 27:21.600
But you also carry
a taste of me

28:12.985 --> 28:15.070
You got what you wanted.
Satisfied?

28:15.237 --> 28:17.739
Of course,
you guys are the perfect couple!

28:17.906 --> 28:21.702
They announce the winners at
the Fausto theater at 10 PM tonight.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.204
- Don't let me down!
- But don't forget,

28:24.371 --> 28:26.248
I'm only doing it for the money!

28:29.209 --> 28:32.671
Hey, come here!
What did you tell him?

28:32.838 --> 28:36.925
Me? Nothing. You know me,
I wouldn't breathe a word!

29:01.867 --> 29:03.410
Wait... wait up!

29:03.911 --> 29:05.996
- Where you headed?
- Let me give it a shot!

29:06.163 --> 29:08.040
What are you doing, man?

29:08.540 --> 29:12.252
You don't know
the first thing about riding bikes.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.338
I'll bring it back tonight.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.882
Goddammit!

31:18.962 --> 31:20.464
What are you doing here?

31:20.672 --> 31:22.591
Is your neighborhood off-limits?

31:22.758 --> 31:26.011
- I don't like people being nosey.
- Who does that house belong to?

31:26.178 --> 31:28.889
Do I ask you about the floozies
crawling around your place?

31:29.056 --> 31:31.475
You telling me you live
with another man?

31:43.195 --> 31:44.780
Is that him?

31:45.072 --> 31:48.367
I told you he'd make you suffer.

31:51.495 --> 31:54.331
- Rita, let's just forget it.
- Ok.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.334
I'll forget about you
and you forget about me.

31:57.501 --> 31:58.335
Come on, baby!

31:58.502 --> 32:03.090
You mean nothing to me!
I don't know you from Adam!

32:04.508 --> 32:06.635
Don't even think
about following me!

32:08.804 --> 32:10.180
You know what?

32:10.472 --> 32:14.685
I'd kiss the ground you walk on if
you lived in a cleaner neighborhood.

32:20.774 --> 32:24.987
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

32:25.154 --> 32:28.157
Especially our contestants.

32:28.991 --> 32:32.870
The grand prize,
as you all know, is 500 pesos

32:33.036 --> 32:36.081
plus a one-month contract
at the Hotel Nacional.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.041
And the winners

32:38.208 --> 32:42.629
of the Fourth Annual RHC

32:42.838 --> 32:45.716
Cadena Azul Amateur Contest are...

32:46.425 --> 32:48.468
Couple Number 21!

32:48.635 --> 32:51.930
Chico and Rita!

32:58.270 --> 33:01.398
A song that was a hit
more than fifty years ago.

33:01.565 --> 33:03.483
By Chico and Rita.

33:03.650 --> 33:07.571
You're listening
to "Yesterday's Melodies"

33:07.738 --> 33:10.949
on Radio Progreso.

33:16.371 --> 33:21.627
I never meant to own you,

33:22.085 --> 33:27.132
I was a nobody,
lacking vanity

33:28.133 --> 33:30.302
I gave you

33:31.053 --> 33:33.639
The best of my life

34:20.018 --> 34:21.978
You have a marvelous voice.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.482
One of those voices that you have to
listen to with your eyes closed.

34:25.649 --> 34:28.944
Of course, in your case
it would be a shame.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.862
You see those girls over there?

34:31.029 --> 34:34.908
I could take any one of them
and make a star out of her.

34:35.117 --> 34:38.078
They're dying for somebody
to discover them.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.496
Like I've done with you.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.498
What's your price?

34:43.458 --> 34:47.462
The price of success is success.
I mean real success.

34:47.629 --> 34:51.507
And I'm not talking Havana.
I'm talking New York!

34:52.342 --> 34:53.677
New York?

34:54.844 --> 34:56.388
My dream!

34:56.847 --> 34:58.599
Is that a "yes"?

34:59.183 --> 35:02.603
It's an "of course"
as in "when do we leave?".

35:03.812 --> 35:06.064
Now you're talking!

35:18.202 --> 35:19.912
But where's Chico's name?

35:20.329 --> 35:21.705
Chico?

35:22.164 --> 35:25.209
Hey, honey,
how can I leave without him?

35:25.375 --> 35:27.628
New York is full of piano players.

35:27.961 --> 35:31.298
Chico's not just a piano player.
Chico is...

35:32.299 --> 35:34.301
well, Chico.

35:36.887 --> 35:38.222
Wait.

35:48.273 --> 35:49.483
Leave me alone!

35:49.650 --> 35:50.817
Is that what you like?

35:50.984 --> 35:53.946
Having these guys
at your beck and call?

35:54.112 --> 35:56.740
I'm sure you didn't tell him
to get lost.

35:56.907 --> 35:58.992
You were straight in there.

35:59.576 --> 36:02.538
And where are you going with him?
Oh, let me guess.

36:02.704 --> 36:05.958
Why settle for
a shit-hole of a room

36:06.124 --> 36:08.794
when you can have
a suite at the Nacional?

36:15.801 --> 36:17.302
All settled.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.394
I still don't see Chico's name.

36:26.270 --> 36:28.647
Two names or none!

36:36.738 --> 36:38.157
Chico!

36:39.449 --> 36:40.784
Chico!

36:41.451 --> 36:42.369
What's up?

36:42.536 --> 36:45.539
- I'm looking for Chico.
- I didn't hear him arrive.

36:45.831 --> 36:48.041
She hears what she wants to hear.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.878
She says she's deaf,
but she doesn't miss a thing.

36:51.044 --> 36:55.215
- Well, you two sure keep her busy.
- They keep me up every night.

36:55.382 --> 36:59.136
If you want to come up here,
we can wait for him together.

37:02.055 --> 37:05.350
- Pour me another!
- Ok, but this one's your last.

37:05.851 --> 37:09.438
C'mon, man, why don't you
go home and sleep it off?

37:33.545 --> 37:35.130
Hey, Juana.

37:35.297 --> 37:37.674
Do me a favor
and take him home with you.

37:37.841 --> 37:39.343
No problem.

37:48.310 --> 37:49.770
Hey, baby.

37:56.068 --> 37:57.236
Don't worry.

37:57.402 --> 38:00.614
Mommy's gonna take good care of you.
She'll put you to bed,

38:00.781 --> 38:02.699
tuck you in...

38:03.742 --> 38:05.869
Juana, I can walk on my own, ok?

38:06.912 --> 38:08.622
Who loves you, baby?

38:08.789 --> 38:10.749
Who loves you, Chico?

38:10.916 --> 38:13.836
Exactly, who loves me, huh?

38:14.795 --> 38:17.005
Your Juanita...

39:25.365 --> 39:26.658
Chico.

39:33.540 --> 39:34.875
Ramon!

39:36.793 --> 39:39.755
So you were leaving
without saying goodbye?

39:41.298 --> 39:43.342
Do you want me
to say anything to him?

39:43.509 --> 39:44.635
Yeah.

39:46.178 --> 39:49.348
Tell him I don't ever want
to see him again!

39:49.640 --> 39:53.060
You know something?
I never would have let you go.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.567
It's a pity
I didn't fall in love with you.

40:06.698 --> 40:08.158
A pity.

41:56.225 --> 41:58.185
Ok, so we're all square!

42:02.856 --> 42:04.066
Chico!

42:06.235 --> 42:08.237
I know how to find Chano Pozo.

42:08.403 --> 42:10.447
His sister gave me a letter for him.

42:10.614 --> 42:15.869
He can make it happen
for us over there in New York.

43:39.953 --> 43:41.288
My name is Chico!

43:42.664 --> 43:44.166
It used to be.

43:52.090 --> 43:53.258
Chico!

43:53.509 --> 43:54.968
Chico, get up!

43:55.844 --> 43:56.970
Chico!

43:57.596 --> 43:58.931
Chico, get up!

43:59.097 --> 44:01.558
- Get up, brother!
- What's going on?

44:01.725 --> 44:04.061
Guess what?
We're arriving!

44:19.076 --> 44:20.577
New York!

44:20.994 --> 44:22.496
New York!

44:35.509 --> 44:36.677
Dammit!

44:37.094 --> 44:38.679
Careful, bro.

44:55.362 --> 44:58.991
Let's go. Rita should be
getting ready for the first show.

45:05.455 --> 45:08.333
- Rita Labelle?
- La-belle.

45:09.126 --> 45:11.795
I like it. Sounds classy.

45:12.838 --> 45:13.839
Follow me!

45:14.006 --> 45:15.632
Come on.

45:32.649 --> 45:34.318
For Rita Labelle?

45:35.152 --> 45:37.488
I'll take them, thanks.

45:38.614 --> 45:39.740
Here!

45:42.493 --> 45:43.535
Wait.

45:44.953 --> 45:46.413
I'll do the honors!

45:51.710 --> 45:52.961
Scram!

46:10.562 --> 46:13.649
"I needed to kiss you again"

46:22.616 --> 46:24.493
What are you doing here?

46:24.701 --> 46:27.871
Didn't Ramon tell you that
I never wanted to see you again?

46:28.038 --> 46:31.041
- I need to talk to you.
- Where's your girlfriend?

46:31.208 --> 46:34.294
- Why didn't you bring her?
- She means nothing to me!

46:34.461 --> 46:37.714
That's what you said,
and then I found you two making out!

46:37.881 --> 46:39.091
Enough already!

46:39.258 --> 46:42.427
One day you drop me,
the next you come looking for me!

46:42.594 --> 46:44.471
You think you can do
what you want with me?

46:44.638 --> 46:48.308
Rita, I know I've been a jerk,
but I'm here now and I love you.

46:48.475 --> 46:52.563
We're not... in Cuba and
I'm not the girl you used to know!

46:52.729 --> 46:54.690
You're still the same girl to me!

46:54.857 --> 46:57.693
Don't you realize
that everything's changed?

46:57.860 --> 46:59.111
Look at me!

46:59.987 --> 47:03.782
That girl you reduced to tears
stayed back in Havana!

47:05.159 --> 47:06.410
Go away!

47:07.119 --> 47:10.789
Get outta here!
Go and don't come back!

47:12.666 --> 47:14.209
Whatever you say.

47:28.724 --> 47:32.102
Come on,
it's not the end of the world.

47:32.561 --> 47:34.897
Hey, we're in New York!

47:42.362 --> 47:44.448
Look... I think this is the place.

48:01.924 --> 48:03.550
It's Charlie Parker!

48:13.185 --> 48:16.271
Look, that one over there
is Chano Pozo!

48:21.819 --> 48:23.487
Chano Pozo!

49:24.381 --> 49:27.050
Hey, who's the guy with the hat?

49:27.217 --> 49:29.553
Where did you two escape from?

49:29.720 --> 49:32.055
Did Cuba sink or something?

49:39.521 --> 49:43.609
I was supposed to be down South
right now with Dizzy Gillespie.

49:43.775 --> 49:45.694
But you know why I'm here?

49:46.528 --> 49:50.491
Because we're not allowed
in a lot of places down there either.

49:51.742 --> 49:54.745
We have to use
the service entrance at hotels,

49:54.912 --> 49:57.706
sit in the back of buses.

49:57.998 --> 49:59.750
There are even different bathrooms.

49:59.917 --> 50:03.128
There are more sons of bitches
there than in Cuba, man.

50:03.295 --> 50:04.671
Shit, be careful!

50:36.453 --> 50:38.038
Gotta keep movin'.

50:40.791 --> 50:42.251
You did right in coming.

50:42.417 --> 50:44.002
Machito, Mario Bauza,

50:44.169 --> 50:48.215
Miguelito Valdes, Arsenio...
They're all here.

50:48.757 --> 50:51.969
People are crazy about Cuban music.

50:52.386 --> 50:55.597
All they wanna dance
is mambo, conga...

50:55.764 --> 50:58.058
Our time has come!

51:02.187 --> 51:04.273
Let's get high!

51:06.608 --> 51:10.070
- What the hell is this?
- Let me see.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.870
Shit!
I think they sold you oregano!

51:18.036 --> 51:19.663
- Oregano?
- Oregano!

51:19.830 --> 51:21.331
Gimme that!

51:22.291 --> 51:25.502
That son of a bitch!

51:27.838 --> 51:29.840
- C'mon, man, let's go!
- Where?

51:40.475 --> 51:43.896
If you think you can cheat me,
you better think again!

52:01.538 --> 52:03.707
Listen up, Cabito!

52:03.916 --> 52:06.418
Nobody cheats Chano Pozo!

52:06.585 --> 52:11.673
Tell your friends.
Nobody screws with Chano Pozo!

52:23.602 --> 52:26.355
Here, rule number one is: respect!

52:47.835 --> 52:50.504
Your beers are gonna get warm!

52:53.215 --> 52:56.343
It's party time! Cuba!
New York!

52:57.261 --> 53:00.472
What's that Bebop shit?
Cu-bop!

53:00.639 --> 53:03.600
That's what it is!
Mantecaaa!

53:18.949 --> 53:20.159
Chano!

53:40.971 --> 53:41.930
Chano...

53:42.097 --> 53:43.932
Chano!

53:46.476 --> 53:48.353
Chano Pozo,

53:48.520 --> 53:51.899
To your memory I sing
this rumba as a tribute

53:52.065 --> 53:54.568
to your work

53:55.569 --> 54:00.365
May God take you in His bosom
and offer you His goodness

54:02.493 --> 54:07.539
May the Holy Spirit
help you rest in peace

54:11.627 --> 54:14.046
Chano Pozo, Chano Pozo,

54:14.213 --> 54:16.715
Cuba and the rumba mourn for you

55:35.836 --> 55:39.214
Those juicy contracts
will be coming soon. Trust me.

55:39.882 --> 55:41.800
This is just
to keep you finely tuned.

55:41.967 --> 55:45.345
What now?
Another birthday for white kids?

55:54.980 --> 55:58.734
It's a private party on Park Avenue
for some big fish.

55:58.901 --> 56:01.028
I think a Hollywood producer
is gonna be there.

56:01.195 --> 56:02.738
At least, you'll eat well!

56:03.947 --> 56:07.409
- Where did you leave the car?
- We'll go in yours!

56:08.535 --> 56:09.912
We'll do what?

58:20.209 --> 58:21.752
Kidney beans!

58:21.919 --> 58:24.463
Eat, baby, eat!

58:27.132 --> 58:31.386
- That's delicious!
- Sit down, sit down!

58:31.845 --> 58:35.432
It's an honor to have you
right here in my kitchen!

58:39.102 --> 58:41.146
You look like a Yankee!

58:42.773 --> 58:45.234
But I still like kidney beans.

58:46.777 --> 58:50.864
I've seen you in magazines.
You're headed for Hollywood, right?

58:51.406 --> 58:54.409
Aren't you tired
of playing Miss Charming?

58:58.789 --> 59:01.250
Don't you like me
sitting by your side

59:02.084 --> 59:03.627
eating kidney beans?

59:03.794 --> 59:05.712
I like it so much it frightens me.

59:06.463 --> 59:09.007
- What are you frightened of?
- Same thing as you.

59:10.759 --> 59:12.845
Why should I be frightened?

59:13.011 --> 59:15.430
Of listening to your heart for once.

59:16.014 --> 59:19.268
Of leaving your cage
and not finding your way back.

59:20.686 --> 59:22.479
You really believe that?

59:27.109 --> 59:28.026
Come with me!

59:28.193 --> 59:32.406
Don't tell me you're gonna
leave without finishing.

59:33.574 --> 59:34.741
Yes!

59:36.493 --> 59:37.911
Are you coming or not?

59:38.078 --> 59:41.832
Oh, Mary, Mother of God,
what is this?

59:54.720 --> 59:56.430
Easy does it!

59:59.183 --> 01:00:00.267
Careful!

01:00:03.645 --> 01:00:06.398
- Shit! Damn American cars!
- Careful!

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:18.535
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, nothing!

01:00:18.869 --> 01:00:21.622
- So wipe that smirk off your face!
- Ok.

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:24.166
Rita Martinez.

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.919
What are you mumbling about?

01:01:29.648 --> 01:01:30.774
Rita...

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:40.868
"I needed to kiss you again"

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.564
Yeah, same ol' shit!

01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:16.612
Yes, yes, yes.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.577
Don't tell me that horse finally won?
What's its name?

01:02:23.952 --> 01:02:27.164
Do you remember
that investor I told you about?

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:28.790
No.

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:32.544
Well, our hard times are over, Chico.
From now on,

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:35.255
- straight to the top!
- Maybe you are.

01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:38.550
So are you.

01:02:39.343 --> 01:02:40.427
Look.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.514
- What is this?
- It's a contract.

01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:47.768
Dizzy Gillespie needs
a piano player for his band.

01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:51.647
Tomorrow you fly to Europe.
A month in Paris and then a tour!

01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:56.485
The opportunity of a lifetime, Chico!

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:59.399
Sorry, dear, for being late.

01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:02.486
- I had no-one to take care of Lily.
- Lily?

01:05:02.653 --> 01:05:06.448
My puppy. She's like a baby.
She can't be left alone.

01:05:07.032 --> 01:05:09.243
Are you sure

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.787
you don't want to go for a stroll?

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:15.415
No! I've been told
this film is really good!

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:20.838
Oh, c'mon.

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:24.800
The music is so lovely,
and she's such a good performer!

01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.510
Hi, Lily!

01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:15.601
Like it?

01:06:43.712 --> 01:06:46.215
Another blackout!

01:06:46.381 --> 01:06:48.884
What do you need light for
at this ungodly hour?

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:51.762
Go to sleep! Tomorrow
we've gotta work for our country.

01:06:51.929 --> 01:06:54.181
He was reading Granma
and the lights went out

01:06:54.348 --> 01:06:56.767
just when it was getting
interesting.

01:07:06.485 --> 01:07:08.487
I dream

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:10.614
I love you

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:13.367
as I did yesterday.

01:07:16.912 --> 01:07:23.627
Sweet scents are reborn
and come into play

01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:34.388
My soul takes flight
and recalls moments divine

01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:44.982
Echoes of kisses,
two destinies, yours and mine

01:08:53.926 --> 01:08:55.260
Rita!

01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:57.845
- What a surprise!
- Where is he?

01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.515
I need to talk to him!

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.017
Please Rita,
don't go looking for problems,

01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:03.727
just when things are going so well.

01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:05.520
- For who?
- For all of us!

01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:07.356
And above all, for you!

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:10.024
You can't be fighting with Ron
every night.

01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:12.736
Don't you get it?
I can't stand him!

01:09:12.903 --> 01:09:14.529
But, you mean everything to him!

01:09:14.696 --> 01:09:17.491
Yeah, I'm his biggest investment!

01:09:17.658 --> 01:09:20.243
- True, but he made you what you are.
- Yeah.

01:09:20.911 --> 01:09:22.578
A miserable wretch!

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:25.957
And who could make you happy, Rita?

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:27.835
Who?

01:11:48.058 --> 01:11:50.811
You mind telling me
who the hell Lily is?

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:55.774
Lily?

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:58.402
Yeah, Lily!
What's wrong with you?

01:11:59.111 --> 01:12:00.654
Are you deaf?

01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:02.406
I met her in Paris.

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:05.993
She used to sit by my side
whenever I played the piano.

01:12:06.243 --> 01:12:08.704
You must have been
very fond of her

01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:11.331
to write a beautiful song like that.

01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:16.128
Well... who hasn't been in love
at least once in their life?

01:12:16.295 --> 01:12:18.005
What happened to her?

01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:20.090
She passed away.

01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:22.968
I'm sorry.

01:12:23.135 --> 01:12:25.596
She also used to like
to lick my hand.

01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:27.723
Bitch!

01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:31.393
She was a tiny dog, silly.

01:13:02.466 --> 01:13:05.594
It'd be better ifwe didn't
see each other for a few days.

01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:10.098
New Years Eve, I debut
at the Hotel Pelican in Vegas.

01:13:10.265 --> 01:13:11.391
Come the day before...

01:13:11.558 --> 01:13:14.645
Have you thought about your career?
About your future?

01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:16.730
Future, what future?

01:13:17.439 --> 01:13:19.775
The future never gave me anything!

01:13:20.776 --> 01:13:23.278
All my hopes are set on the past.

01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:35.415
I haven't seen
that expression for years!

01:13:35.666 --> 01:13:37.251
I'm tying the knot!

01:13:41.296 --> 01:13:43.799
Congratulations!
When?

01:13:43.966 --> 01:13:46.927
New Year's Eve in Las Vegas.

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:20.914
Are you sure no-one by that name
was on the plane to Vegas?

01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:22.374
Ok.

01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.834
Thanks.

01:16:58.952 --> 01:17:00.829
What were you expecting?

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:03.540
He did it before!

01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:08.670
And good ol' Ron
is always there for me, right?

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.101
Stop drinking!

01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:32.778
Don't spoil it all now!

01:19:04.369 --> 01:19:07.206
Your passport will be
withheld until further notice.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.291
What?

01:19:50.499 --> 01:19:54.086
Chico?
They've cancelled tonight's show!

01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:55.921
What?

01:19:57.089 --> 01:19:59.675
They don't like
this kind of music any more.

01:19:59.842 --> 01:20:02.594
Jazz is considered imperialist.

01:20:03.387 --> 01:20:05.305
It's the enemy's music!

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:10.102
If you wanna keep on working,
you'll have to join the Party.

01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:12.855
- That's it!
- But, that's crazy!

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:18.610
Viva Fidel!

01:20:18.777 --> 01:20:20.612
And then there was light, brothers.

01:20:20.779 --> 01:20:24.199
Now they're screwing with us
in the middle of the night.

01:20:24.366 --> 01:20:26.034
So the whole point is to protest.

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:27.953
The light goes out, complain,
it comes back on...

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.040
Comrade, it's just
that I was dreaming about...

01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:34.668
Well, you know about who.

01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:36.670
Who?

01:20:36.837 --> 01:20:42.634
About you, baby, who else?
I gotta tell the world about it.

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.946
Chico!

01:21:03.113 --> 01:21:04.239
Chico!

01:21:10.329 --> 01:21:11.747
Chico!

01:21:13.207 --> 01:21:14.625
Piss off!

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:17.544
There are some gringos
asking about you!

01:21:18.128 --> 01:21:19.254
What are you saying?

01:21:19.421 --> 01:21:21.507
That singer and her producers.

01:21:21.798 --> 01:21:25.385
You know that young singer, man,
the pretty one, that big star!

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:28.972
Let them find somebody else.
I'm not a musician any more.

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:34.061
They know that but when they heard
you were still alive, they went nuts!

01:21:34.353 --> 01:21:36.355
Who said I'm alive?

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:33.495
It's been years since
I've been this close to one.

01:22:47.176 --> 01:22:48.385
Maestro...

01:22:49.219 --> 01:22:51.054
Don't call me Maestro.

01:22:52.014 --> 01:22:53.599
Call me Chico.

01:22:55.267 --> 01:22:57.436
I've got all your records.

01:23:01.273 --> 01:23:05.027
How's it possible that a girl
as young and pretty as you

01:23:05.194 --> 01:23:07.571
can own all those old records?

01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:10.949
That's my favorite song.

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:14.244
I've always dreamed of recording it.

01:23:15.662 --> 01:23:16.955
"Lily"!

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:20.501
Lily...

01:26:33.694 --> 01:26:35.279
I thought...

01:26:36.572 --> 01:26:37.948
What?

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:42.661
That I'd never see you again.

01:26:45.664 --> 01:26:47.791
I've been waiting

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:52.212
47 years for you.

01:26:54.798 --> 01:26:56.925
Waiting for you

01:26:57.301 --> 01:26:59.052
everyday

01:26:59.428 --> 01:27:01.680
to knock on this door.

01:27:02.806 --> 01:27:04.516
And, just like that,

01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:06.351
you're here.

01:27:07.227 --> 01:27:08.896
No call, no nothing.

01:27:14.026 --> 01:27:16.612
You haven't changed.

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.700
You look as beautiful

01:27:22.159 --> 01:27:23.785
as ever.

01:27:25.245 --> 01:27:27.164
Oh, Chico!

01:27:28.332 --> 01:27:30.417
All this time...

01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:33.962
you were...

01:27:34.922 --> 01:27:36.632
you were here?

01:27:36.799 --> 01:27:39.176
They were nice to me.

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:43.096
They let me have this room

01:27:44.014 --> 01:27:49.937
in exchange for my doing
the house-keeping.

01:27:53.607 --> 01:27:55.108
May I come in?

01:29:08.348 --> 01:29:11.560
to Bebo

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:18.218
