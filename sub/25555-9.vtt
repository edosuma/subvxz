08:12.725 --> 08:14.760
<i>Can I please talk to Kortni</i>
<i>for a second?</i>

08:14.827 --> 08:16.162
Who is this?

08:16.229 --> 08:17.630
<i>It's Logan.</i>

08:17.697 --> 08:19.732
(hangs up phone)

08:19.799 --> 08:23.870
The last person in this whole
world-- and it's a big world--

08:23.936 --> 08:27.240
that should ever call
this house... is Logan.

08:27.306 --> 08:31.143
{\an5}(phone ringing)

08:27.306 --> 08:31.143
Oh, hell nah!

08:31.210 --> 08:32.510
What does he think,
that he can just, like,

08:32.578 --> 08:34.447
call here after he
barged into our house?

08:34.513 --> 08:36.182
I'm about to give Logan
a piece of my mind.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.950
Do you not get the point?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.217
If someone hangs up on you,

08:39.284 --> 08:40.953
that means no one
wants to talk to you.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.621
{\an5}<i>I, I don't give a (bleep).</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:42.621
So don't call here again.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.958
{\an5}<i>Let me talk to... hello?</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:45.958
No. No. No.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.527
You barged into our house
like a crazy person.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.897
{\an5}<i>No, I didn't.</i>

08:48.594 --> 08:50.897
No, and you not only scared me,

08:50.963 --> 08:53.199
you scared Candace and you
scared the other roommates.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.502
So you need to quit calling
here, you're not welcome--

08:56.569 --> 08:58.371
{\an5}<i>I don't--</i>

08:56.569 --> 08:58.371
--until you can get
your act together

08:58.437 --> 09:00.940
and stop acting
like an immature child.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.542
Okay? Do you understand?

09:03.609 --> 09:05.978
Do you understand?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.346
(hangs up phone)

09:07.413 --> 09:09.215
{\an5}♪♪

09:07.413 --> 09:09.215

09:09.282 --> 09:10.416
What the (bleep)
does he think calling here,

09:10.483 --> 09:13.386
like... the (bleep)?

09:13.452 --> 09:15.621
Logan, if you think
I'm gonna let Kortni

09:15.688 --> 09:17.657
talk to your psychotic ass,

09:17.723 --> 09:19.358
you have another think coming.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.160
{\an5}Did y'all hear me
on the phone? I said,
"Who is this?"

09:21.227 --> 09:22.828
{\an5}He said,
"You know who this is.
Give Kortni the phone."

09:22.895 --> 09:23.963
I didn't know.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.131
You know, he has
all these personalities,

09:25.197 --> 09:26.599
so he sounds different
every time.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.935
{\an1}I said, "You are not welcome
here, don't call back."

09:29.001 --> 09:30.169
{\an3}Click.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.938
I am scared.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.540
Logan knows where we live.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.943
We can't be talking to him
however on the phone

09:37.009 --> 09:38.511
and just hanging up on him
and stuff.

09:38.577 --> 09:39.879
He might show up again.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.847
That's scary stuff.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.449
That's so psycho of Logan.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.718
That's what happens
when you...

09:45.785 --> 09:47.520
jump into serious (bleep)
after three weeks.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.322
{\an1}I know.
What if she's...?

09:49.388 --> 09:51.290
{\an5}Oh, I know,
that's the worst part
about all this,

09:51.357 --> 09:53.225
'cause... imagine, like,

09:53.292 --> 09:56.195
that being your parents
and, like, not together.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.730
{\an1}Huh.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.733
{\an5}(Kirk)
If Kortni's actually pregnant,
God help us all.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.868
{\an8}This kid's gonna be
like the "Omen" child.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.838
{\an8}He's gonna come out just...
"Bleah...."

10:05.905 --> 10:08.874
Ah, pray that, you know...

10:08.941 --> 10:10.876
that that's not the case,
'cause if it is,

10:10.943 --> 10:13.179
(bleep)'s about to flip.

(Codi)
I can't stand this anymore.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.994
I mean, we have
this awkward tension

10:28.060 --> 10:29.295
between Candace and Kortni,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.630
and I'm in the middle
of this thing.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.601
I just hate that you guys
have been best friends

10:35.668 --> 10:36.902
since last summer

10:36.969 --> 10:39.805
and all the way up
until that one night.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.474
Thank you for having my back,
Kortni.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.608
{\an1}She knows
you're in the wrong,

10:42.675 --> 10:44.343
{\an1}that's why she doesn't
have your back.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.778
I don't want nothing to do
with that (bleep),

10:45.845 --> 10:47.046
because of the way
you (bleep) look at me

10:47.113 --> 10:48.481
and you (bleep)
disrespect me.

10:48.547 --> 10:49.882
{\an5}I didn't disrespect you.

10:48.547 --> 10:49.882
Yeah, I didn't have your back.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.617
{\an5}Yes, you did!

10:49.949 --> 10:51.617
I didn't disrespect you.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.419
{\an4}I said
"Thank you for having my back."

10:51.684 --> 10:53.419
You stare at me

10:53.486 --> 10:54.687
like I'm a piece
of (bleep) (bleep)

10:54.754 --> 10:57.156
and I won't do
a goddamn thing, Candace!

10:57.223 --> 10:58.858
{\an1}I wasn't sitting there
taking any sides.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.393
{\an1}I was sitting there
letting y'all hash it out

11:00.459 --> 11:01.727
{\an1}'cause I didn't
wanna get involved.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.095
And that's the difference
between you and I,

11:03.162 --> 11:04.997
because as a person
that understands pressure,

11:05.064 --> 11:08.067
there are certain cases where
you can't be a neutral party.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.436
I'm still very hurt
by how things turned out,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.405
and clearly Kortni
is not capable

11:12.471 --> 11:14.240
of seeing my side of things.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.608
I honestly don't know

11:15.674 --> 11:17.043
if me and Kortni can be
close friends after this.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.745
{\an1}Ain't nar' a person stood up
to defend me on nothing.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.480
It only has been
Nilsa and Aimee,

11:21.547 --> 11:23.215
and I'm not even close
with Nilsa and Aimee.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.985
{\an5}(Kortni)
This conversation is making me
completely stressed out.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.053
I might be pregnant.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.921
I don't need this at all.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.424
This is the thing, though.
When she stormed upstairs,

11:31.490 --> 11:33.859
{\an5}do you think
the first two people
she wanted to turn to--

11:33.926 --> 11:35.227
{\an4}No--

11:33.926 --> 11:35.227
--were Aimee and...
I'm saying.

11:35.294 --> 11:36.529
{\an1}--but I was letting her
calm down.

11:36.595 --> 11:37.630
{\an6}She went--

11:36.595 --> 11:37.630
{\an1}You know what?
I get snapped on.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.898
But she wanted you
to run up...

11:38.964 --> 11:40.199
{\an1}But she wanted you to run up
there and help her.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.967
You're her best friend
in the house.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.103
Then say, "Kortni, can we,
like, go outside and talk?"

11:44.170 --> 11:46.539
{\an5}But why would I say that?
You was busy--

11:44.170 --> 11:46.539
Like, don't run away from me.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.074
{\an6}But as...

11:46.605 --> 11:48.074
You was busy
being there for Gus.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.508
{\an1}I was not busy.
You walked upstairs

11:49.575 --> 11:51.343
{\an5}and I walked over to Gus.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.343
But as a, but as a great...

she's gonna value Gus and
Jeremiah's friendship over me,

23:29.074 --> 23:30.342
{\an5}and that's okay.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.342

Kirk stepping up

23:39.684 --> 23:41.019

{\an1}They're both single
at this point.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.414
{\an6}(Candace)
Yaaas...

39:08.946 --> 39:10.414
Might as well have some fun.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.616
{\an5}Might as well have some fun.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.616
Look at 'em,
look at 'em now.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.988
I learned so much
from you,

39:18.055 --> 39:19.890
and I really
appreciate that.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.899
{\an5}(Gus)
It's like they're
complete opposites,

39:28.966 --> 39:30.267
{\an5}but opposites attract.

39:28.966 --> 39:30.267
But opposites attract.

39:30.334 --> 39:31.435
Opposites do attract.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.137
From my perspective
looking in,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.106
I do see that Jeremiah looks
at Kortni a certain way,

39:35.172 --> 39:36.273
and you know what?

39:36.340 --> 39:37.408
Really, Jeremiah and Kortni

39:37.475 --> 39:38.709
could be a good balance
for each other.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.644
Some people kinda see
a little connection

39:40.711 --> 39:42.747
between you and Jeremiah.

39:42.813 --> 39:45.082
{\an1}They always do say opposites
attract, do they not?

39:45.149 --> 39:47.017
And obviously you are

39:47.084 --> 39:50.521
complete different ends
of the spectrum.

39:50.588 --> 39:52.223
While me and Logan
were together,

39:52.289 --> 39:54.391
I would have never
thought of Jeremiah like that.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.427
I really did think of him
as a brother.

39:56.494 --> 40:01.599
But, I mean, yeah,
I'm attracted to Jeremiah.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.167
What the (bleep)?

40:03.234 --> 40:04.435
{\an3}Honestly.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.003
I'm asking your right now,
face to face.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.671
Is that something
you would want?

40:07.738 --> 40:11.408
{\an5}Like, are you comfortable--

40:07.738 --> 40:11.408
{\an1}I would totally have
Jeremiah's kids.

40:11.475 --> 40:14.245
{\an4}I would totally have,
I would to--

40:11.475 --> 40:14.245
I'm not saying nothing
about kids, girl.

40:14.311 --> 40:15.813
Stop talking about kids
all the time.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.882
You just got
out of that (bleep).

40:17.948 --> 40:19.517
Don't go back to there
right now.

40:19.583 --> 40:22.820
Are you kidding me?
Jesus.

40:22.887 --> 40:24.822
{\an1}I have a type,
and that's like...

40:24.889 --> 40:26.190
That's what you
look for, correct?

40:26.257 --> 40:28.993
I would root for that
if I were to go to...

40:29.059 --> 40:30.728
like, into a relationship.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.163
I mean, you can't hide
your feelings, you know?

40:32.229 --> 40:34.398
If you feel that way,
you feel that way.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.268
{\an1}I'm just not gonna put myself
in that situation

40:37.334 --> 40:39.804
{\an5}unless he feels that way.

40:37.334 --> 40:39.804
{\an3}Yeah.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.005
I'm kinda taken aback

40:41.071 --> 40:42.439
by the feelings I have
for Jeremiah,

40:42.506 --> 40:45.743
but now that I talked
about it and it's out there,

40:45.810 --> 40:48.479
maybe something will happen.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.415
I have no idea what I'm doing.

40:51.482 --> 40:54.485
{\an5}Oh, my God...

40:51.482 --> 40:54.485
I'm just saying...

40:54.552 --> 40:57.021
{\an1}Now you have me thinking,
like, holy (bleep)...

40:57.087 --> 40:58.889
{\an1}Like, "Oh, what if
Jeremiah likes Kortni?"

40:58.956 --> 41:00.457
I'm like, "Goddamn."

41:00.524 --> 41:02.259
{\an1}If you're saying you feel like
you need to go for Jeremiah,

41:02.326 --> 41:03.427
then you need to go
for Jeremiah.

41:03.494 --> 41:04.528
Follow your heart.

41:04.595 --> 41:06.597
{\an1}Goddamn, wouldn't that
be some (bleep)?

41:06.664 --> 41:09.767
{\an1}It would be, it would be...
completely some (bleep).
