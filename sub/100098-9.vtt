WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.515
I'm a mercenary.
I don't play fair.

00:03.760 --> 00:07.037
<i>I would rather see you lose
than win myself.</i>

00:07.160 --> 00:09.696
<i>- The Deus Group.
- We can take them all down.</i>

00:09.720 --> 00:10.896
I just need
their phone numbers.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.513
Get them all
in a room together.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.600
I'm resigning.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.016
<i>We've been
waiting for Elliot Alderson's</i>

00:15.040 --> 00:16.520
<i>next move,
and this could be it.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:18.910
We will not wait for them
to make a mistake.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.993
<i>Arrange a Deus Group meeting
to confirm a successor.</i>

00:22.080 --> 00:24.914
<i>- Wellick.</i>
- Make sure you take care of Whiterose.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.671
<i>We got the access we needed
to transfer the money from the bank's side.</i>

00:30.800 --> 00:31.950
<i>We can rob them blind.</i>

00:32.040 --> 00:33.040
This is all my fault.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
You wanna help me?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.556
Go find Elliot,
and take them down.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.680
I own everything!

00:37.760 --> 00:39.956
<i>Every bribe,
blackmail, extortion,</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.918
<i>everything will go public.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.037
Mr. Alderson,
he's too much of a liability.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.430
If we kill him, his shipping hack
dies with him.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.433
<i>It's time he learns
we're on the same side.</i>

00:49.520 --> 00:51.432
<i>See? They all came back.</i>

00:51.520 --> 00:53.113
Everyone's okay again.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.550
Angela, whatever Whiterose
told you is a lie.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.757
<i>I know it's possible.
I've seen it.</i>

00:57.840 --> 01:00.071
I don't know if I can go through
with the hack anymore.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
Look at me.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.153
I am not the one
Darlene talked to.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.916
You shouldn't be sitting there.
That's not your seat.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.639
- Why?
- They're not ready yet.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.915
We need to wait.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.120
How is he?

02:09.199 --> 02:10.554
It's not going
to happen today.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.238
There's no point
in waiting here now.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.000
We aren't going anywhere.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.156
You know where he is,
you need to bring him here.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.036
It's not that simple.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.352
We're gonna have
to help him through this.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.120
Well,

02:33.840 --> 02:36.036
maybe we should
just tell him now.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
About everything.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.913
Then Elliot will be okay,

02:47.200 --> 02:48.200
right?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
I'm telling you,

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
he's not ready.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.360
When will he be ready?

03:11.920 --> 03:13.718
You've let this
go on far too long.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.400
It's a little more
complicated than that.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.896
I didn't know everything
that was happening...

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
That's a lie.

03:18.520 --> 03:19.576
You've been part
of these shenanigans

03:19.600 --> 03:21.159
from the beginning,
you encourage it...

03:21.240 --> 03:23.391
Okay, okay. Just stop.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.479
Yes, I'll admit it.

03:26.760 --> 03:27.760
I did.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.720
I never thought
he'd take things this far.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.154
There's nothing
I can do now.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.070
Just talk to him.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.160
We have to finish
his mission.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.352
Once the hack is done, maybe
then I can get through to him.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.999
How are you gonna do that?

03:48.880 --> 03:50.678
I'm gonna show him
what he did.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.634
And if it doesn't work?

04:06.520 --> 04:08.000
We can't go on like this.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.074
And that poor boy,

04:13.480 --> 04:14.914
we may lose him forever.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.736
For God's sake,
he hasn't woken up since...

04:17.760 --> 04:19.079
That's not true.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.280
Darlene.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.159
She said they talked,

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
two months ago.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.034
He woke up for her.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.636
Which means she might be
the one who could help us.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.791
Great. You decided to show.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.351
<i>I know.
You weren't expecting me.</i>

05:19.640 --> 05:21.552
<i>But I'm here for Elliot,
same as you.</i>

05:22.720 --> 05:24.757
<i>What can you expect
after what happened?</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:27.912
<i>Life throws you
an error code like that,</i>

05:28.000 --> 05:31.277
<i>you don't have the luxury
of a fucking pop-up explanation.</i>

05:31.360 --> 05:33.431
<i>So, what are you
supposed to do?</i>

05:33.560 --> 05:35.358
<i>Move on without answers?</i>

05:35.480 --> 05:38.757
<i>Or stay down and drive yourself
crazy with questions?</i>

05:38.840 --> 05:40.194
<i>That's where Elliot is,</i>

05:40.280 --> 05:41.794
<i>mired in conflict.</i>

05:42.560 --> 05:44.119
<i>And that's why I'm here.</i>

05:44.200 --> 05:45.236
How we doing?

05:46.960 --> 05:49.794
I've got line of sight on the IMSI
catcher to the front door.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.076
Deus members
should be arriving soon.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.913
Where the fuck
have you been?

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
Got held up.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.873
What kind of answer
is that?

06:00.600 --> 06:01.636
You had me worried.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.677
I told you the Dark Army
is looking for you.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.439
The day didn't go
exactly as planned.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.115
Cut me some slack, okay,
things went a little sideways.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.960
Oh!

06:10.320 --> 06:12.073
Really? Is that so?

06:12.160 --> 06:14.356
Things went a little
sideways for you, huh?

06:15.160 --> 06:16.936
You wanna hear about
the fucking night I've had?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.316
This isn't a pissing contest,
sweetheart.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.838
Let's just get back to work.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.675
What the fuck
are you doing?

06:38.360 --> 06:39.476
Why are you here?

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
Where is he?

06:46.640 --> 06:47.960
You don't want him
here right now.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.789
Why the fuck not?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.519
He just can't. Not now.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.629
What happened to him?

07:00.760 --> 07:01.830
He'll be fine.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.195
He just needs some time.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.354
I don't trust you.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.309
I don't need you
to trust me.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.198
I just need you
to help me pull this off.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.272
Tell me what's going on,
or I'm walking.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
I can't.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.519
He needs to be the one
to tell you,

07:18.640 --> 07:19.710
when he's ready.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.416
What the fuck
are you doing here?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.656
Do you realize
how risky this is?

07:39.680 --> 07:40.875
What if someone saw you?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.594
She's with me.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.909
Out with it.
Why are you here?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.296
You're supposed to be across
the street with your Deus pals.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.357
There's one last thing
I need from you.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.716
Well, it's a little late
in the game to be making demands.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.634
It's... It's not a demand.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.109
It's a favor.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.993
Given the danger you've put us
all in just by being here,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.594
I hope it's worth it.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.680
It is.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.316
What's this?

08:13.960 --> 08:17.078
I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

08:18.760 --> 08:23.198
Everything you need to know
about her project is on here.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.075
Promise me.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.159
After tonight,
she'll be ruined.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.193
Why is this
important to you?

08:36.720 --> 08:38.712
Because it was important
to Angela.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.434
It's what she wanted.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.150
Okay.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.520
I promise.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.989
Remember, you gotta keep everyone there
until we grab their phone numbers.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.675
Don't let anyone leave,
especially Whiterose.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.676
What was that about?

09:17.800 --> 09:18.800
Hey!

09:19.760 --> 09:22.150
What the hell does Price
know about Angela?

09:24.640 --> 09:25.676
What is going on?

09:25.760 --> 09:26.955
I'll fill you in.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.953
But right now,
we gotta get started.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.429
We're already behind.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.118
<i>In order to rob
the Deus Group blind,</i>

09:35.200 --> 09:38.318
<i>we need to get access to transfer funds
from Cyprus National Bank.</i>

09:38.960 --> 09:41.919
<i>To do that, we need every
Deus asshole's phone number.</i>

09:42.400 --> 09:43.400
<i>Why?</i>

09:43.520 --> 09:45.696
<i>Because Darlene can then match
each of those phone numbers</i>

09:45.720 --> 09:48.474
<i>to its corresponding Cyprus
National Bank account number</i>

09:48.560 --> 09:49.789
<i>and initiate a transfer.</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:54.277
<i>Once she initiates the transfer,
it'll trigger a security 2FA code</i>

09:54.360 --> 09:56.716
<i>that'll be texted to every Deus
dickhead's phone.</i>

09:56.880 --> 09:58.917
<i>Then Darlene will run a script
to automatically,</i>

09:59.000 --> 10:00.320
<i>grab those 2FA codes</i>

10:00.400 --> 10:03.313
<i>and transfer all their money
before they have time to stop it.</i>

10:09.360 --> 10:10.760
<i>So, yeah, I'm worried.</i>

10:12.640 --> 10:14.597
<i>For what though,
I'm not sure.</i>

10:16.400 --> 10:17.754
<i>But whatever it is...</i>

10:20.640 --> 10:21.756
<i>...it's coming.</i>

10:30.440 --> 10:33.319
I can't believe Angela never
told me Price was her father.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.000
Maybe she didn't know.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.715
I miss her.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.440
Darlene, I...

10:54.520 --> 10:56.273
No, I don't wanna
talk about it. I just...

10:58.240 --> 10:59.799
I just wanted to say that.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.880
Okay.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.234
Something's not right.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.476
No one's gone in or out
of that building other than Price.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.400
What, you think
they're onto us?

11:35.160 --> 11:36.389
I don't know.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.997
I see
I'm the first to arrive.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.992
Technically, I was first.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.753
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.157
I thought
we'd start with a drink.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.040
I'm an old man, Zhang.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.997
I gave up on foreplay
long ago.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.909
Let's just skip ahead to the part
where you try to fuck me, hmm?

12:30.600 --> 12:31.875
<i>If they are onto us,</i>

12:31.960 --> 12:33.440
<i>if the Deus Group
doesn't show,</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:36.115
<i>everything we've been working on
will be a big fucking fail.</i>

12:37.040 --> 12:39.919
<i>If Elliot were here,
what would he do?</i>

12:40.600 --> 12:43.479
<i>He'd look for abnormalities,
incompatibilities,</i>

12:44.080 --> 12:45.480
<i>anything that
isn't adding up.</i>

12:46.400 --> 12:47.629
<i>Any conflicts.</i>

12:47.720 --> 12:49.439
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.400
- For?
- I don't know yet.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.791
Elliot saved an image
of Tyrell's phone,

12:54.880 --> 12:56.234
swiped all his credentials.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.079
If Whiterose thought
something was up,

12:58.160 --> 12:59.336
she would've told
the other members

12:59.360 --> 13:01.272
including the guy
she was having the meeting for.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.000
All you had to do
was nothing.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.235
Just sit idly by and wait
for the new year to arrive.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.676
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.596
I wanted to let you live
into retirement.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.080
I'd planned on it,

13:23.840 --> 13:25.433
as a gift, of sorts.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.957
I guess you can say I always get swept up
when it comes to the holidays.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.393
But then you had
to be naughty.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.360
Come on, Zhang,

13:37.200 --> 13:39.237
you know I've never been
the nice type.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.356
Hmm?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
Let me drive.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.435
Maybe his calendar.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.991
<i>After your
abrupt resignation</i>

13:52.080 --> 13:54.311
and Mr. Alderson's
curious disappearance,

13:54.400 --> 13:57.552
it wasn't hard to figure out that
you two were working together.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.838
Tell me Mr. Alderson's plan,

14:00.120 --> 14:03.750
and these gentlemen will take you home
and inject you with maitotoxin.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.993
You will die in your sleep.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.080
The papers will say
you passed from heart failure.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.996
Sad, but painless.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.720
Or, we could go
the other way.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.392
You're well aware
of our methods.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.714
So, you canceled
the Deus Group meeting

14:33.800 --> 14:38.477
based on this half-cocked
conspiracy theory of yours?

14:39.800 --> 14:43.953
This last-minute change will not
sit well with the others.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.073
Downtown. Near Wall Street.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.757
Hey, are you hearing this?

14:51.840 --> 14:54.275
Let's move. We gotta go.
Do or die time.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.760
They're probably
already inside,

14:55.840 --> 14:58.116
which means we have to find
a way in to get line of sight.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.152
Price didn't know
about the venue change.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.760
So what?

15:05.120 --> 15:06.349
Why didn't they tell him?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.238
I don't know, he's persona non grata,
on his way out.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.470
Who gives a shit?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.599
Why the heavy
security detail?

15:13.680 --> 15:14.875
Price is one guy.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.600
If they wanted
to get rid of him,

15:16.680 --> 15:19.149
they don't need a team of
Dark Army soldiers to do it.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.200
They're not there
to kill Price.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.919
They're there
to protect someone.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.000
The meeting
is taking place as we speak.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.554
I'm sure Mr. Wellick,

15:37.640 --> 15:43.511
the new CEO of E Corp,
is impressing everyone with his smile.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.356
Unfortunately, I will be
uncharacteristically late

15:46.440 --> 15:48.671
for the gathering,
but I'm sure they'll understand.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.198
Will they? Hmm.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.799
I'd expect mutiny

15:54.480 --> 15:56.711
when they realize
that Tyrell Wellick,

15:56.800 --> 16:01.477
your guest of honor and
the sole purpose for the meeting,

16:02.280 --> 16:04.715
will not be in attendance.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.080
I'm gonna stay.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.190
What?

16:15.280 --> 16:17.875
You have the exploit to verify
the phone numbers ready to go.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.590
No, we can't split up.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.560
What if something else
goes wrong with the plan?

16:28.240 --> 16:29.880
You know,
it just occurred to me,

16:30.440 --> 16:33.080
we've never gotten drunk
together, have we?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.758
I think this might be
a good night to start.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.269
What do you think?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.040
<i>The plan is pointless</i>

16:46.120 --> 16:47.759
if we don't get
Whiterose, too.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.496
She's gotta be in there.
I have to stay.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.776
No, that makes no sense.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.075
We only have
one IMSI capture.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.640
We need to do this together.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.870
We don't have a choice.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Now go.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.152
Mr. Wellick
is nowhere to be found.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.976
We're still searching
the tri-state area...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.319
A waste of time. Stop.

17:05.839 --> 17:06.839
Tell 'em all to stop.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.755
Is this part of your plan?

17:11.319 --> 17:13.277
Mr. Wellick's mysterious
disappearance?

17:14.119 --> 17:15.119
What did you do to him?

17:15.599 --> 17:16.920
Well, truthfully, I...

17:17.520 --> 17:19.751
I have no idea where Wellick is.
I mean, he...

17:20.160 --> 17:21.388
He may be dead.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.390
Mmm.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.876
No, no... Now, now that
I think of it, he...

17:25.960 --> 17:27.519
He did mention
something about

17:28.480 --> 17:31.837
wanting to travel
the great southwest

17:32.880 --> 17:35.236
in a '65 El Camino
convertible,

17:35.560 --> 17:37.040
wind in his hair.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.600
He's beaten you!

18:17.640 --> 18:18.835
You lost today.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.200
Doesn't mean
we can't fight back tomorrow.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.879
But right now,
we have to leave

18:23.360 --> 18:25.829
and warn the Deus Group
before this gets worse.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.196
We are not going anywhere.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.474
If you won't listen to reason,
then I'm done.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.556
Oh.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.120
It's bad management

18:53.120 --> 18:56.431
when your best employees
either walk off the job

18:57.080 --> 18:58.719
or blow their brains out.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.430
Mmm.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.000
How the fuck
am I gonna get in there?

19:42.800 --> 19:43.800
Perimeter is secure.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.554
Make sure these doors stay locked
the rest of the evening.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.750
How are you, my friend?

20:09.840 --> 20:13.038
I just came off an 11-hour
flight on Christmas Day.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.952
- Ah.
- My wife is furious.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.834
And my girlfriend,

20:17.480 --> 20:18.880
she won't return
my phone calls.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.996
Mmm.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.720
Whatever Zhang has planned
better be good.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.880
Couldn't agree more.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.680
- Speaking of...
- Good evening, gentlemen.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.480
Back inside.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.159
This entrance
is off-limits tonight.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
Go.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.599
There's no fucking way.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.280
Well...

22:42.880 --> 22:43.950
Who is it?

22:53.160 --> 22:54.160
Hello?

22:54.280 --> 22:56.400
<i>This sure as hell
doesn't sound like Price.</i>

22:56.520 --> 22:57.520
Mr. Alderson...

22:59.200 --> 23:00.554
It's good
to hear your voice.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.120
I was hoping we could talk,

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
in person.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.599
<i>You once told me that we'd never
see each other again.</i>

23:07.680 --> 23:09.558
What makes you
wanna see me now?

23:09.960 --> 23:11.440
Call it a change of mind.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.910
A realization.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.400
Nah.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.954
If I'm hearing your voice
on the other end of this call,

23:21.080 --> 23:22.080
<i>I'm good.</i>

23:23.440 --> 23:24.510
And what does that mean?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.874
You'll know soon enough.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.440
A proposal.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.440
You stop whatever it is you're planning,
and I give you information

23:36.560 --> 23:38.240
<i>that will prove to be
very valuable to you.</i>

23:38.440 --> 23:39.794
You think
I'm gonna trust you?

23:40.360 --> 23:41.714
<i>Well, let me earn your trust</i>

23:41.800 --> 23:43.154
by sharing first.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.515
It is about your friend...

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
Angela.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
What about her?

23:53.600 --> 23:54.600
<i>You see, Elliot...</i>

23:56.560 --> 23:58.074
You think Angela's dead.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.595
But she's not.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.079
You sent me a picture

24:09.160 --> 24:11.550
of her dead body,
you sick fucking fuck.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.276
And you believe
what most people believe,

24:15.240 --> 24:16.959
only what is right
in front of you?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.997
I expected more from you.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.276
<i>If you think I'm gonna
believe this bullshit...</i>

24:24.240 --> 24:26.596
You killed her.
Angela's dead.

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
<i>No, Elliot.</i>

24:28.960 --> 24:30.280
Angela's alive.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.315
And if you allow me,

24:35.160 --> 24:36.230
<i>I can take you to her.</i>

24:38.080 --> 24:39.400
<i>Would you like that, Elliot?</i>

24:40.560 --> 24:42.233
<i>Would you like
to see Angela again,</i>

24:43.480 --> 24:44.550
<i>to hear her voice,</i>

24:46.520 --> 24:47.636
<i>to hold her hand?</i>

24:59.280 --> 25:00.999
Elliot, are you there?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.279
I know you have
regrets, Elliot...

25:21.960 --> 25:22.996
...and pain.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.816
<i>I know there are things in your life
you wish were different,</i>

25:26.840 --> 25:28.718
<i>just the same as Angela.</i>

25:28.800 --> 25:32.589
<i>And I can show you a way
you can make it all go away,</i>

25:33.160 --> 25:34.355
<i>just as I did for her.</i>

25:34.800 --> 25:37.952
<i>You can reset everything and
live in the world you deserve,</i>

25:38.120 --> 25:40.760
<i>a world without
all the pain you carry,</i>

25:41.080 --> 25:43.914
<i>without your past,
without your regrets.</i>

25:44.800 --> 25:48.680
<i>Please, Elliot,
let me show you the world</i>

25:48.760 --> 25:50.513
that I showed
your closest friend.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.760
I saw what you did to her

26:03.880 --> 26:05.030
before you killed her.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.394
<i>That wasn't Angela.
You used her.</i>

26:11.480 --> 26:13.358
<i>You turned her
into someone else.</i>

26:14.080 --> 26:15.639
Then don't take
my word for it.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.880
Ask her yourself.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
<i>Elliot...</i>

26:25.080 --> 26:27.197
<i>We don't have to fight
like this anymore.</i>

26:28.440 --> 26:32.912
<i>Let's finally make peace with each other,
as we were always meant to do.</i>

26:37.600 --> 26:41.514
<i>Let go of the anger and the hatred
you've built up towards me.</i>

26:41.840 --> 26:44.230
Understand I've only
wished to help.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.600
Here's the thing.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.193
I don't need help right now.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
You do.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.336
<i>Good evening, people of Earth.</i>

27:09.360 --> 27:12.910
<i>We are fsociety.
We have risen from the ashes</i>

27:13.000 --> 27:15.640
<i>to bring you
a Christmas miracle,</i>

27:15.720 --> 27:20.078
<i>a miracle that will finally reveal
our true nemesis.</i>

27:20.280 --> 27:24.274
<i>The secret club running
the world is the Deus Group,</i>

27:24.360 --> 27:28.434
<i>a clandestine collection of the world's
richest and most powerful people.</i>

27:28.600 --> 27:32.640
<i>Deus Group, we know you,
and we know what you do.</i>

27:32.920 --> 27:36.516
<i>And tonight, the whole world
will learn about you.</i>

27:36.640 --> 27:39.553
<i>Most of you watching have never heard
the name Deus Group.</i>

27:39.800 --> 27:42.554
<i>That's because they have worked hard
to keep it that way.</i>

27:42.680 --> 27:44.831
<i>To begin
to understand their reach,</i>

27:45.000 --> 27:48.072
<i>to see the evil crimes
they are responsible for,</i>

27:48.400 --> 27:51.632
<i>click on the link below to download
all their private files.</i>

27:51.720 --> 27:54.872
<i>And if you'd like to meet
the despicable individuals</i>

27:55.120 --> 27:57.680
<i>who have corrupted your lives
for profit,</i>

27:57.960 --> 28:03.319
<i>come meet them now in person while
they wine and dine at Cipriani.</i>

28:03.400 --> 28:05.995
<i>I am sure
they'd appreciate the visit.</i>

28:08.320 --> 28:10.551
<i>Deus Group,
you have been owned.</i>

28:10.680 --> 28:16.756
<i>Fsociety and the world will cheer
as we watch your black heart stop beating.</i>

28:16.880 --> 28:19.952
<i>This is not a warning. This is
the beginning of the end.</i>

28:20.440 --> 28:22.796
<i>We are fsociety.</i>

28:36.680 --> 28:37.680
Hey.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.792
- Did you see the video?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

28:40.920 --> 28:43.435
Hopefully, that'll do the trick
to smoke these fuckers out.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.236
<i>- Did you find Whiterose?</i>
- Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.117
- I talked to her.
<i>- You what?</i>

28:49.920 --> 28:51.559
Jesus Christ,
you were supposed to

28:51.640 --> 28:53.313
hack her phone, not call it.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.795
It was only for a second.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.389
<i>But it was Price's phone,</i>

28:58.480 --> 29:00.517
<i>so we still need
to get Whiterose's number.</i>

29:04.440 --> 29:05.440
Are you okay?

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
I don't know.

29:12.760 --> 29:13.876
I don't know anymore.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.160
Hey, Elliot...

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
I'm glad you're back.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.151
- Hey, I gotta go.
<i>- What happened?</i>

29:51.920 --> 29:52.920
There is a cell tower.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.360
If I can see traffic
on that tower...

29:55.400 --> 29:56.436
No. I mean...

29:56.520 --> 29:59.115
We can get past her security
and into the hotel.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.113
We need her phone number.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.200
<i>Hey.</i>

30:03.600 --> 30:04.636
Are you gonna be okay?

30:04.720 --> 30:07.235
<i>This only works if we hit
their accounts at the same time.</i>

30:07.320 --> 30:10.392
<i>If the other members get the 2FA
codes first, they'll alert Whiterose.</i>

30:10.480 --> 30:11.920
<i>Just keep them
in your line of sight.</i>

30:12.320 --> 30:13.720
I'll let you know
when I've got her.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.919
Sergey,
you have to trust me.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.313
We will get through this.
Everything will be all right.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.957
Oh, don't listen
to that Mason.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.032
Man's an absolute buffoon.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.631
<i>Yeah, no. No, don't leave.
Don't go outside.</i>

30:38.760 --> 30:39.955
Tell everyone to remain.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.230
Sergey.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.560
<i>Sergey.</i>

30:51.400 --> 30:52.400
Hello?

30:52.880 --> 30:53.916
Hello?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.959
So that's it?
So that's your big move?

31:04.040 --> 31:05.997
You think that
I can't survive being doxed?

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
I have no idea.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.718
I'm as curious as you.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.391
It's Brezhnev. Hello?

32:32.240 --> 32:34.357
Rudolphson. Okay.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.136
I can't do anything
about it. Look, it's not working.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.480
Obviously, it's not working!

33:59.840 --> 34:01.040
Look,
I can't do anything!

34:21.159 --> 34:23.096
Private event tonight.
You can't be here.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
Everyone, back it up.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.157
A short time ago, fsociety
resurfaced with a new video,

34:53.239 --> 34:56.551
and while the contents of that video
remain largely unconfirmed,

34:56.719 --> 35:01.033
it focuses entirely on an international
investment firm, the Deus Group.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.256
It's a collection
of powerful men

35:22.280 --> 35:25.478
whom fsociety claims to be guilty
of international crimes.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.200
And as you can see behind me,

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
onlookers have gathered

35:28.520 --> 35:31.354
with hopes of catching a glimpse
of any Deus Group members.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.154
Let's go! Come on!

36:25.560 --> 36:28.473
All this over a little
pipsqueak in a hoodie.

36:40.640 --> 36:41.790
Where are we at, kiddo?

36:42.600 --> 36:45.434
I've got a bunch of numbers. I just
can't tell if any of them are hers.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.230
<i>Truth be told,
I never liked Mr. Alderson,</i>

36:48.840 --> 36:52.629
with his anxious demeanor,
his juvenile anger.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.590
But he does bring something
to the table.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.075
Well, for me.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.438
<i>Mr. Alderson
is the only person I believe</i>

37:25.520 --> 37:29.196
actually able to hurt you...

37:56.200 --> 37:57.680
<i>...truly hurt you.</i>

38:00.200 --> 38:01.316
And clearly,

38:03.080 --> 38:04.309
you believe it, too.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.240
Come on.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.515
Why do we have to cut these things
so goddamn close?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.320
What are you doing?

38:57.600 --> 38:58.716
Peaceful out here.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.800
Cold winter air.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.279
Are you really going to make me
force you into the car?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.796
You know, I almost let myself
believe you...

39:33.480 --> 39:35.472
...when you said
Angela was still alive.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.079
I know what kind of conman you are,
how you operate.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.753
Even though I saw your men
drag her dead body away,

39:46.800 --> 39:48.917
I still wanted to believe
what you were saying.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.159
<i>When you spoke
to Mr. Alderson,</i>

40:11.840 --> 40:14.355
I felt the power
of your promise.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.952
And all I could think was, "Well, maybe
that's what my daughter felt

40:28.600 --> 40:29.716
"when you came to her."

40:37.480 --> 40:41.315
<i>The desperation to have
all her pain go away,</i>

40:41.400 --> 40:43.437
to have her past rewritten.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.878
And that's why
it works, right?

40:56.240 --> 40:57.880
<i>The one thing
every person has...</i>

40:59.080 --> 41:00.116
...regret.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.674
<i>You weaponize that.</i>

41:03.320 --> 41:05.755
<i>And then you use that weapon
against them...</i>

41:06.840 --> 41:07.840
<i>...to destroy them.</i>

41:08.160 --> 41:10.356
But here's the thing
I've realized as of late.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.440
With Angela,

41:12.520 --> 41:13.520
didn't work.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.354
<i>Angela lives on</i>

41:21.200 --> 41:24.079
<i>in the lives of the people
who love her.</i>

41:25.440 --> 41:26.440
<i>And that love...</i>

41:27.040 --> 41:32.877
<i>That love fuels their unwavering
resolve to turning the tables</i>

41:33.280 --> 41:34.555
<i>to destroy you.</i>

41:50.600 --> 41:51.920
So you just
remember, Zhang,

41:52.920 --> 41:55.230
you did all of this
to yourself.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.873
You should take
your own advice, Phillip.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.834
Accept your truth.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.160
It's over.

42:12.880 --> 42:13.880
Yes.

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
Yes.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.480
I suppose it is.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.640
It happened.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.354
It actually happened.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.400
What?

42:47.320 --> 42:49.152
Something wrong, old sport?

42:53.840 --> 42:54.840
What is this?

42:55.840 --> 42:57.399
Well, if it's what
I think it is,

42:59.040 --> 43:00.190
we're all broke.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.040
No.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.230
That's impossible.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
Apparently not.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.158
Where is it, Phillip?
Where is my fucking money?

43:24.840 --> 43:26.069
Gone.

43:30.680 --> 43:31.796
No.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.560
I warned you. I told you
long ago. I'm a mercenary.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.839
I'd rather see you lose
than win myself.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.994
That can't be...

43:40.080 --> 43:41.514
Finally, I found the way

43:42.000 --> 43:44.196
to take what's
most important to you.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.749
No. No.

43:46.640 --> 43:47.915
Your project,

43:49.600 --> 43:53.514
your dream
of another world...

43:54.960 --> 43:56.519
It's as good as dead.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.153
Think of it
this way, Zhang.

44:07.720 --> 44:09.313
You didn't lose the game,

44:11.840 --> 44:14.196
you just ran out of time.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.760
<i>And like that...</i>

44:46.400 --> 44:47.550
<i>...Rome falls.</i>

44:49.360 --> 44:50.714
<i>No more Deus Group.</i>

44:52.200 --> 44:55.671
<i>No more top one percent
of the top one percent.</i>

44:57.720 --> 45:00.315
<i>No more controlling
every piece of our lives.</i>

45:06.680 --> 45:09.149
<i>No more playing God
without permission.</i>

45:10.960 --> 45:12.474
<i>We took them down.</i>

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
<i>All of them.</i>

45:49.720 --> 45:51.791
FBI. Open the door.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.600
We have a warrant.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.999
Mr. Zhang,
we have a warrant.

46:03.760 --> 46:04.760
Open the door.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.999
Minister Zhang, come out!

46:20.720 --> 46:22.040
Minister Zhang!

46:25.960 --> 46:27.758
Minister Zhang,
we are coming in!

46:29.280 --> 46:33.194
Three, two, one,
execute, execute, execute!

46:52.360 --> 46:53.874
<i>Up. Upstairs.</i>

46:56.560 --> 46:57.755
<i>Move it.</i>
