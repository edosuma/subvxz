01:34.832 --> 01:37.832
Understand we have a lot
of sexual tension going on.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.266
Being a sexual tractor beam's
a burden.

01:40.332 --> 01:42.200
I find it difficult, too.

01:42.266 --> 01:43.498
Boom.

01:43.565 --> 01:46.000
Mm, mm, mm.
I'm successful and sexy.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.399
Oh, shit.

01:49.466 --> 01:51.299
Is it weird that
I wanna kiss me?

01:55.332 --> 01:57.899
Relax your tits, uncle ibbs.

01:57.966 --> 02:01.000
Quick snack break and I'll be

02:08.631 --> 02:10.598

02:13.000 --> 02:16.265
Oi, stop eating those "plantons"

02:16.332 --> 02:18.531
and get back to work.

02:18.598 --> 02:21.066
Smoking that ganja every night.

02:21.133 --> 02:22.966
It's "plantain."

02:47.200 --> 02:48.966
Guys...

02:50.798 --> 02:53.299
Boys, this is the last time

02:53.366 --> 02:55.899
things will be the way
they were 'cause...

02:55.966 --> 02:58.133
'Cause I'm leaving the icc.

02:58.199 --> 03:00.232
You need to find another
manager 'cause I can't...

03:00.299 --> 03:01.765
Shit!

03:20.866 --> 03:22.332
Good job, Robert.

03:22.399 --> 03:24.765
When you assert yourself,
respect is inevitable.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.933
Hey, come back! Hey!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.133
Hey, where you going, Robert?

03:29.199 --> 03:32.399
Guys, guys, I'm just...

03:32.466 --> 03:33.899

Tekken and titties, bruv.

03:56.066 --> 03:58.366
Can you even use DVD's
on a PlayStation?

03:58.432 --> 04:00.100
Of course.

04:00.165 --> 04:01.399
I'll Google that.

04:01.466 --> 04:03.366
- What's "goo-goo"?
- Google.

04:03.432 --> 04:07.066
It's a search thing we use at
university that kinda helps.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.100
Never mind.

04:11.366 --> 04:13.132
Hey, cap, listen.

04:13.866 --> 04:16.766
Look, you went uni,
I'm still here.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.933
I'm done stacking
pritt sticks and pva.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.265
Like, I've found something
we've gotta do,

04:22.332 --> 04:24.899
- and it ain't school.
- What's wrong with school?

04:24.966 --> 04:27.199
Well, you're the only one
who's still going, cap.

04:27.265 --> 04:30.265
We're on pirate radio now.
Yeah, we made it.

04:30.332 --> 04:31.966
Our demo was a classic.

04:32.033 --> 04:34.631
The three of us in one room
got us on freek fm.

04:34.698 --> 04:36.866
When we're together,
it's just different.

04:36.933 --> 04:40.132
And while you been at uni,
bro, we've blown up.

04:40.199 --> 04:43.099
The ice cold crew ain't
nothing without you, cap.

04:43.165 --> 04:45.598
But look, you
can still manage the icc

04:45.665 --> 04:47.165
and do university.

04:47.232 --> 04:50.099
You can do both, bro.
I know you can.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.698
After radio come the raves,
manager man.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.141
But we haven't planned
anything for the biggest.

05:18.165 --> 05:20.041

Tonight, that's us.
That poster, that's us.

12:44.099 --> 12:45.932
Tonight, we're going
twice as nice

12:45.999 --> 12:47.732
- at flippin' club colosseum.
- You reckon.

12:47.798 --> 12:49.309
Yeah, we ain't' starting
a new millennium

12:49.333 --> 12:51.132
with porn, zoots, and
a flippin' PlayStation.

12:51.199 --> 12:54.433
- Ooh, FIFA tournament.
- Not tonight, kid.

12:54.499 --> 12:56.400
Tonight, getting into that party

12:56.467 --> 12:58.165
is the only thing that matters.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.631
Caps, if you and your
big brain can make it happen,

13:00.698 --> 13:02.132
I'll get Sophie.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.698
If I get Sophie...

13:04.765 --> 13:07.300
I might touch a boob.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.333
Wow! Boob!

13:09.400 --> 13:11.665
Anything could happen
after that, I wouldn't care.

13:11.732 --> 13:15.698
But this isn't just any
new year, it's <i>the</i> new year.

13:15.765 --> 13:18.099
Anyone who's anyone
is gonna be there.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.798
And I'm gonna be there.
We're gonna be there!

13:21.832 --> 13:24.300
Look, whatever happens
with Sophie,

13:24.367 --> 13:27.598
I'm starting the year 2000
at twice as flippin' nice

13:27.665 --> 13:29.798
with my best mates.

13:29.865 --> 13:31.999
You want the same thing, right?

13:33.965 --> 13:35.965
Look, I know you're not
asking me, yeah,

13:36.032 --> 13:37.999
but for what it's worth, I do.

13:38.065 --> 13:41.631
Yeah, I want things
to be nice... twice.

13:41.698 --> 13:43.832
You do too, innit, cap?

13:45.099 --> 13:46.865
Caps?

13:50.200 --> 13:53.898
- I'm in.
- Yes! Oh, yes!

14:01.367 --> 14:03.400
So, what you so desperate
to talk about, eh, caps?

14:03.467 --> 14:05.233
Ah, it can wait.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.200
Priorities, t.

14:08.631 --> 14:11.732
Let's get these fucking tickets.

14:11.798 --> 14:14.132
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:28.631 --> 14:31.932
So, what's the plan, t?

14:31.999 --> 14:34.865
Well, I hadn't really
thought past this bit.

14:34.932 --> 14:36.932
What, so we drove
all this way just to be...

14:36.999 --> 14:39.698
Normally you're the man
with the plan, not me.

14:39.765 --> 14:41.841
Look, it's probably the only
place with tickets left.

14:41.865 --> 14:43.598
So, how we gonna buy them?

14:43.665 --> 14:45.433
Buy 'em?

14:45.498 --> 14:47.498
Kid is gonna Nick a set.

14:47.565 --> 14:50.099
- Is he?
- Man like kid.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.665
I heard that kid
isn't gonna do that.

14:54.865 --> 14:58.133
Wait, doesn't your ex work
in there?

14:58.200 --> 15:03.200
We don't really talk
like that, so... nah...

15:04.400 --> 15:06.032
Hey!

15:06.100 --> 15:07.598
These are twisted Levi's,
you chief!

15:07.665 --> 15:08.941
I saw you got those
from uncle ibbs.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.400
Bruv, you got fake ones?

15:10.466 --> 15:11.932
Not you, two tonne. Not you.

15:11.999 --> 15:13.965
Look, these ain't
no pirate jeans.

15:14.032 --> 15:20.233
Look, me and Kelly, we're not
on the most amicable terms.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.498
- What'd you do?
- It's... it's complicated.

15:23.565 --> 15:25.698
What happened?

15:26.565 --> 15:28.200
Oh, fuck sakes.

15:28.266 --> 15:30.898
Yo, two tonne,
if she pies you off,

15:30.965 --> 15:33.832
ask for Ronnie...
Probably feel sorry for you.

15:33.898 --> 15:35.698
- Was it that bad?
- Worse.

15:59.432 --> 16:02.999
Hey, kel, h-how you been?

16:15.233 --> 16:17.367
Well!

16:17.432 --> 16:19.698
It's good to see you, t.

16:19.765 --> 16:22.932
You're looking well,
considering.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.300
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...

16:25.367 --> 16:28.999
Considering you're in a coma.

16:29.066 --> 16:30.100
I-I got better?

16:30.166 --> 16:32.233
You told me you were terminal.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.898
- Surprise!
- Six months.

16:36.965 --> 16:40.233
It's been six months since
you dumped me so you could

16:40.300 --> 16:42.598
go on holiday with your mates
as a single man.

16:42.665 --> 16:44.367
Kelly, look, I didn't dump you.

16:44.432 --> 16:47.200
You're right, the doctor
you pretended to be

16:47.266 --> 16:49.565
told me you were dying.

16:54.498 --> 16:56.266
Kels...

16:57.066 --> 17:01.631
I messed up, but i'm
a pretty messed-up guy.

17:02.765 --> 17:04.333
But you were always there
for me in ways

17:04.399 --> 17:06.965
I just wasn't grown
enough to understand.

17:07.033 --> 17:11.066
Because, like...
You're my fire, kel.

17:13.498 --> 17:15.166
The one desire.

17:15.233 --> 17:18.066
Believe when I say,

17:18.133 --> 17:21.133
I want it that way, but
we're two worlds apart.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.366
I can't reach to your heart
when you say

17:23.432 --> 17:26.765
that I want it that way.
Like tell me why, kel.

17:26.832 --> 17:31.233
Ain't nothing but a heartache.
Tell me why, kel.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.832
Ain't nothing but a mistake.
Like, tell me why, kel.

17:34.898 --> 17:40.033
I never wanna hear you say,
like, that I want it that way.

17:45.233 --> 17:46.531
Kel.

17:46.598 --> 17:50.399
Wait... is that j.Lo?

17:50.466 --> 17:52.266
- Hm?
- Nah.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.200
That's those boys,
the American ones.

17:55.266 --> 17:58.332
- The backdoor something.
- Back-a-yard bush boys.

17:58.399 --> 17:59.933
- T?
- Mm?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.040
I know you didn't just try
to explain yourself to me

18:02.066 --> 18:04.531
using the lyrics
from "I want it that way"

18:04.598 --> 18:06.732
- by the back-a-bush...
- Backstreet boys.

18:06.798 --> 18:08.765
Backstreet fucking boys.

18:08.832 --> 18:10.541
The words chimed with me,
you know what I mean.

18:10.565 --> 18:11.898
Terrell, I swear to god.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.665
Whoa, whoa, wait,
you don't happen to have

18:13.732 --> 18:16.266
like four tickets left
for twice as...

18:16.332 --> 18:17.865
Don't call me, don't text me.

18:17.933 --> 18:20.898
I never wanna see you
again, pencil dick!

18:22.100 --> 18:24.466
Look, why don't we just go
uncle ibbs' thing, yeah?

18:24.531 --> 18:26.832
- It's gonna be...
- Shut up, kid.

18:30.466 --> 18:32.798
How about you just call soph?

18:32.865 --> 18:35.798
Tell her you made a promise
you can't keep.

18:36.598 --> 18:38.865
Can... can we not, though?

18:38.933 --> 18:40.865
It's... I-I don't
really like change.

18:40.933 --> 18:44.066
He's right, I can't mess up
my chance with Sophie.

18:44.133 --> 18:46.200
She knows all the words
to "gangsta's paradise."

18:46.265 --> 18:47.498
Bruh!

18:47.565 --> 18:49.133
She's one of the special ones.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.665
So why change the plan?

18:50.732 --> 18:52.133
There's gotta be
some snides about.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.698
I can have a go
on Microsoft paint.

18:53.765 --> 18:55.265
I'm hard with the clip art.

18:55.332 --> 18:56.832
What, fake tickets, kid?

18:56.899 --> 18:59.698
Who's stupid enough
to make fake tick...

19:09.066 --> 19:10.299
What?

19:13.466 --> 19:15.232
Uncle ibbs!

19:17.732 --> 19:19.399
- Aah!
- Aah!

19:21.765 --> 19:24.000
Oh! Thought
you were the old bill.

19:24.066 --> 19:26.966
- Oh, god.
- Don't tell your mum.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.665
Tickets.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.565
- We're after tickets.
- For my party?

19:30.631 --> 19:31.899
- Nah.
- Mnh-mnh.

19:31.966 --> 19:33.399
What tickets do you want, then?

19:33.466 --> 19:35.133
Rewind, selecta!

19:35.199 --> 19:38.299
Can you sort twice as nice?
Like knock-offs or something.

19:38.366 --> 19:41.066
- Like a printout, even.
- You got no pubies yet, man.

19:41.133 --> 19:44.498
We're 18 now. We can finally
go out for real.

19:44.565 --> 19:46.399
18? Since when?

19:46.466 --> 19:47.798
Since this year.

19:47.866 --> 19:49.598
- Grown.
- Adults.

19:49.665 --> 19:51.665
Yeah, men, ah?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.665
Well, whatever happens,
this year...

19:53.732 --> 19:55.299
We're getting it.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.833
- Go home, boys.
- You just let in dickheads.

19:57.899 --> 19:59.498
His mosch ain't even real.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.332
- Edges ain't even laid, bro.
- Innit?

20:01.399 --> 20:02.698
Go home.

20:02.765 --> 20:04.299
Look, is there any way
we can sort...

20:04.366 --> 20:06.100
This ain't no under-18 ting.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.199
- Come back when you're...

20:08.265 --> 20:09.698
Fat?

20:09.765 --> 20:11.232
- You calling me...
- Yes.

20:11.299 --> 20:12.909
I'm saying you're built
like a double-Decker bus.

20:12.933 --> 20:14.531
You are fat. You got hips, bruv.

20:14.598 --> 20:17.432
I wanna take you in there,
I wanna slow dance with you.

20:17.498 --> 20:19.100
Ooh, you remind me of his mum.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.399
Don't come back...

20:20.466 --> 20:23.133
Till you're 18!

20:23.199 --> 20:26.066
We were kids then,
but we're men now.

20:26.133 --> 20:29.833
I remember
new year's when I was 18.

20:31.199 --> 20:34.033
Gyal dem. Ahh.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.399
Batty crease.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.565

20:54.066 --> 20:55.466

20:59.766 --> 21:01.108

- Yeah, popcorn.

21:01.132 --> 21:02.631

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.066
Alright, yeah,

You'll do it?

21:10.665 --> 21:13.631
Four tickets,

21:14.598 --> 21:16.631
Yeah, bad man.

21:16.698 --> 21:18.665

21:18.733 --> 21:22.466

21:25.866 --> 21:28.165
Ah, he's taking the piss now.

21:31.766 --> 21:34.099

21:34.165 --> 21:36.598
You think we should call him?

21:36.665 --> 21:38.799
He'll call.

21:40.066 --> 21:43.299
- Kid, I think we should...

21:43.366 --> 21:46.000

Oh. Hello.

21:54.598 --> 21:56.833
Yeah, yeah.
I'm with them now, yeah.

21:57.799 --> 22:00.000
What, the ugly one or the one

22:00.065 --> 22:03.033
No, no, you can't say that.

22:03.099 --> 22:06.165
Okay, I'll let them know.
I'll let them know now.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.631

22:16.699 --> 22:18.666

He'll have tickets.

22:26.366 --> 22:28.833
- Real ones.
- Real ones? From your uncle?

22:28.899 --> 22:31.199
Yo, kid, look, just tell us
what he said to you.

22:31.265 --> 22:32.933
Can we just call him?
I'm gonna call him.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.666
Look, my uncle called
my brother, yeah?

22:34.733 --> 22:36.008
He called a guy
who owes him one.

22:36.032 --> 22:37.631
The guy who owes him one

22:37.699 --> 22:39.531
Those tickets

22:39.598 --> 22:41.531

22:44.899 --> 22:46.733
- What?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.241
I prefer the olives

45:26.499 --> 45:28.241

45:28.265 --> 45:30.832

45:36.865 --> 45:38.409
No, it is in fact your mum
that is a wardrobe.

45:38.433 --> 45:39.698
Built like a fridge, bruv!

45:39.765 --> 45:41.333
A big ting with a freezer

45:41.400 --> 45:43.276
In fact, your mum's
the biggest wardrobe of all.

45:43.300 --> 45:44.665
Your mum's narnia, bruv!

45:44.732 --> 45:45.975

46:06.232 --> 46:08.199
I'm gonna lose soph

46:08.266 --> 46:09.467
Ask cappo.

46:09.532 --> 46:10.698
Why are you lot acting like...

46:10.765 --> 46:12.233
Well, what?

46:12.300 --> 46:14.732
Stupid? Can't keep up

46:14.798 --> 46:16.607
What's your problem with me
going to university?

46:16.631 --> 46:18.598
I didn't tell you to stay here.

46:18.665 --> 46:20.400
- Your grades did.
- What?

46:20.467 --> 46:21.798
Well, fuck uni!

46:21.865 --> 46:24.367
Me and kid built
something without you.

46:24.999 --> 46:26.199
Like next year we're gonna...

46:26.266 --> 46:28.065
Well, I won't be here!

46:33.467 --> 46:35.598
Well, why not?

46:40.132 --> 46:41.874
You're abandoning us 'cause
you think you're better.

46:41.898 --> 46:43.333
Better? What are you...

46:43.400 --> 46:45.132
Well, you've always
put yourself first,

46:45.200 --> 46:47.333
so why pretend you care
about the same things as us?

46:47.400 --> 46:48.665
T, I put you on the station.

46:48.732 --> 46:52.233
No, no.
You sent in the demo we made.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.798
Yeah?

46:53.865 --> 46:57.099
You're only our manager
'cause you can't mc or dj.

46:57.165 --> 46:58.999
But you can't even manage this.

46:59.065 --> 47:01.075
You, man, look, why don't we
just get back in the car.

47:01.099 --> 47:02.898
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah.

47:02.965 --> 47:04.741
I was there when we made the
demo, and I'm not part of

47:04.765 --> 47:05.841
- the I.C.C.?
- But apart from drive,

47:05.865 --> 47:06.932
what do you do?

47:06.999 --> 47:08.300
We do the show every week.

47:08.367 --> 47:11.132
We got bigger without you,
you bounced!

47:11.200 --> 47:12.233
Bounced?

47:12.300 --> 47:14.132
Uni isn't me giving up
on you lot.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.765
Oh, my god! How?

47:15.832 --> 47:17.166
Like, we're your best friends,

47:17.233 --> 47:19.367
and you left us
when we need you most!

47:19.832 --> 47:22.200
Like I do a job I hate to pay
for records,

47:22.266 --> 47:24.531
to pay to go on air,
and after a year,

47:24.598 --> 47:26.238
they're finally paying us
to play in clubs

47:26.266 --> 47:28.099

wanna fuckin' leave?

47:28.166 --> 47:30.665
I've been driving you around
the city all day for you.

47:30.732 --> 47:33.099
You want Sophie,

47:33.531 --> 47:35.333
But what about what I want, huh?

47:35.798 --> 47:37.358
Look, I been put what I care
about aside

47:37.400 --> 47:39.075
to keep you happy,
and now I'm supposed to feel

47:39.099 --> 47:40.741
guilty because we don't
want the same things?

47:40.765 --> 47:42.932
- T, I want more!

47:42.999 --> 47:45.898

It's bloody puff daddy.

59:58.798 --> 1:00:00.299
Vips or couples?

1:00:00.366 --> 1:00:03.299
Couples. The sexy ones.

1:00:03.366 --> 1:00:05.132
Names?

1:00:05.865 --> 1:00:07.499
Do you not know
your own name, babe?

1:00:07.566 --> 1:00:08.832
Say your name.

1:00:08.898 --> 1:00:10.378
Do you need to phone
a fuckin' friend?

1:00:10.433 --> 1:00:12.232
What's your name?

1:00:13.832 --> 1:00:15.599
Ella...

1:00:16.065 --> 1:00:17.865
And...

1:00:19.733 --> 1:00:22.865
Fitz... Gerald.

1:00:23.566 --> 1:00:24.865
House!

1:00:24.932 --> 1:00:26.733
Why you doing that for?
Nah. Nah.

1:00:26.798 --> 1:00:28.409
- We're down, my name's there.
- What's he done?

1:00:28.433 --> 1:00:29.532
Your name's down? You sure?

1:00:29.599 --> 1:00:31.032
- Yeah.
- You sure, son?

1:00:31.099 --> 1:00:32.467
Yes, I am sure, son.

1:00:32.532 --> 1:00:34.032
I'll go and get my manager.

1:00:34.099 --> 1:00:35.965
Look, man, I'm telling you
my name's on...

1:00:41.332 --> 1:00:43.065
Terrell?

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:45.165
Kelly.

1:00:47.199 --> 1:00:48.832
Looking good.

1:00:48.898 --> 1:00:52.065
- Safe.
- What happened to your eye?

1:00:52.132 --> 1:00:53.433
It was a bee.

1:00:53.499 --> 1:00:55.032
Pricked me in my eyelid.

1:00:55.099 --> 1:00:57.832
Tickets. Terrell.
I don't have time for this.

1:00:58.199 --> 1:01:00.965

1:01:26.865 --> 1:01:27.932

1:01:27.999 --> 1:01:30.265
- Deal.

1:02:07.732 --> 1:02:10.965
but I just want
my boys back, man!

1:02:12.099 --> 1:02:15.532

You reckon

1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:50.467
Look, whatever happens,

1:04:50.531 --> 1:04:51.798
we're doing new years together.

1:04:51.865 --> 1:04:53.999

t's going.

1:04:54.065 --> 1:04:55.999

1:04:56.065 --> 1:04:58.467

- So what's the plan then?

1:04:58.531 --> 1:04:59.732
Colosseum's the plan.

1:04:59.798 --> 1:05:01.467

1:05:21.698 --> 1:05:24.300
What are you doing back here?

1:05:24.367 --> 1:05:25.898
I lost my friends at the bar.

1:05:25.965 --> 1:05:27.665
I can't find my
sort of girlfriend.

1:05:27.732 --> 1:05:30.598
I-I went through some door
and ended up here, so...

1:05:30.665 --> 1:05:33.898
That way.

1:05:35.466 --> 1:05:37.032

1:07:18.598 --> 1:07:21.399
You wanna be with me
at midnight.

1:07:21.466 --> 1:07:25.366
Whatever happens with Sophie,
I'm starting the year 2000

1:07:25.432 --> 1:07:28.631
at twice as flippin' nice
with my best mates.

1:07:28.698 --> 1:07:31.366
Terrell, let's just
have a wicked new year.

1:07:31.432 --> 1:07:33.066
Yeah?

1:07:35.898 --> 1:07:37.300
Where's my massive crew?

1:07:37.366 --> 1:07:40.100
Booo!

1:07:53.399 --> 1:07:55.399
Oi, Fitz! How'd you get in?

1:08:03.066 --> 1:08:04.631
Fuck.

1:08:13.033 --> 1:08:14.574
Look, we're never gonna
get there on time.

1:08:14.598 --> 1:08:15.966
I don't even know where we are.

1:08:16.033 --> 1:08:18.299
- Kid, you looking?
- Hm?

1:08:18.366 --> 1:08:19.898
Kid, kid, kid,
kid, are you looking?

1:08:19.966 --> 1:08:22.100
- I'm on it, cap!
- Thank you.

1:08:22.166 --> 1:08:23.933
Imagine if you computerized
this book, caps.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.875
Satellite navigation thing,
like what the planes have.

1:08:25.899 --> 1:08:28.265
Like a little screen
that told you where you were

1:08:28.332 --> 1:08:29.665
and where you wanted to go.

1:08:29.732 --> 1:08:31.631
- Ooh, like imagine typing...
- Shut up!

1:08:31.698 --> 1:08:33.375
- In your mum's house...
- Shut up! Shut up!

1:08:33.399 --> 1:08:36.066
- Bit rude really, but safe.
- Sorry, man.

1:08:36.133 --> 1:08:37.899
- Alright, left or right?
- I dunno.

1:08:37.966 --> 1:08:39.875
According to my calculations,
we should be in a park.

1:08:39.899 --> 1:08:41.933
Is it on your left,
or is it on your right?

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.865
- Which one?
- This one or this one.

1:08:44.933 --> 1:08:47.000
- Left or right?
- We're near boroughga.

1:08:47.066 --> 1:08:48.698
- Borough.
- What borough?

1:08:48.765 --> 1:08:50.042
Uh, it's just saying
borough here, bro.

1:08:50.066 --> 1:08:51.598
Look at the map! What borough?

1:08:51.665 --> 1:08:53.598
On the left of
south-wark bridge.

1:08:53.665 --> 1:08:55.200
Sounds like a Turkish
food, bruv.

1:08:55.265 --> 1:08:56.765
South-wark.

1:08:56.832 --> 1:08:58.442
Right, I need to know,
I need to know now.

1:08:58.466 --> 1:08:59.746
- Left, left right!
- Safe, safe.

1:09:00.265 --> 1:09:01.866
London is in Europe
because London...

1:09:01.933 --> 1:09:04.332
- London is in england!
- England is in Europe!

1:09:04.399 --> 1:09:06.176
No, but don't worry, bruv.
I know where to go!

1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:07.842
But, bro, bro, what if
the police stop us, huh?

1:09:07.866 --> 1:09:09.531
What did nwa say?

1:09:09.598 --> 1:09:11.033
Fuck the police!

1:09:11.100 --> 1:09:12.899
That way.

1:09:13.332 --> 1:09:15.066
Turn that way...

1:09:15.133 --> 1:09:17.899
Oi, two tonne!

1:09:17.966 --> 1:09:19.774

- Cap, where you going, man?

1:09:19.798 --> 1:09:21.866
- Cap!
- T...

1:09:22.166 --> 1:09:25.598
T... bruv, got the tickets,
but, you know,

1:09:25.665 --> 1:09:27.665
we got lost and couldn't
find the club, so...

1:09:27.732 --> 1:09:29.366
Yo, t, man, where you going?

1:09:29.432 --> 1:09:32.166
Home. I'm done, bruv.

1:09:32.232 --> 1:09:33.833
You lot just go, innit.

1:09:33.899 --> 1:09:35.442
The best thing for all of us
is just to...

1:09:35.466 --> 1:09:37.732
Nah, nah, the best thing
I could do as your manager

1:09:37.798 --> 1:09:40.000
is fire your manager.

1:09:40.066 --> 1:09:41.498
What?

1:09:41.966 --> 1:09:44.765
Listen, t, this is the last
time things

1:09:44.833 --> 1:09:47.299
are gonna be the way they were.

1:09:47.366 --> 1:09:50.531
'Cause I'm leaving the I.C.C.

1:09:50.598 --> 1:09:54.598
It's for the best. For everyone.

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:58.732
I've been practicing that
since this morning.

1:10:02.466 --> 1:10:06.833
T, I can't deejay,
I can't emcee.

1:10:08.332 --> 1:10:10.100
But I love you both.

1:10:14.665 --> 1:10:16.799
Just let me do that, man.

1:10:26.631 --> 1:10:28.732
Cap...

1:10:30.399 --> 1:10:32.732
We can't do this without you.

1:10:35.833 --> 1:10:37.232
What happens if we don't...

1:10:37.299 --> 1:10:39.100
You will!

1:10:40.132 --> 1:10:41.432
I don't know, man.

1:10:41.498 --> 1:10:44.631
You never needed me to do
what you're good at.

1:10:46.066 --> 1:10:49.033
It's about time you started
to believe that, too.

1:10:52.033 --> 1:10:55.598
The home ain't going
anywhere, caps.

1:10:58.132 --> 1:11:00.199
Just make sure you come
back, innit.

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.766
Come on.

1:11:02.833 --> 1:11:05.265
Are you man gonna snog?

1:11:05.466 --> 1:11:07.598
- Shut up, kid!
- Shut up, kid!

1:11:12.866 --> 1:11:16.799
You two are gonna be massive
without me.

1:11:17.466 --> 1:11:19.866
I know it. Alright?

1:11:19.933 --> 1:11:21.866
That change I can handle.

1:11:22.232 --> 1:11:23.265
Just.

1:11:24.933 --> 1:11:26.474
Alright, so where
are we going for midnight?

1:11:26.498 --> 1:11:27.733
I already been twice as nice.

1:11:27.799 --> 1:11:30.033
I can't do another crappy
club man.

1:11:32.498 --> 1:11:33.899
It was crap?

1:11:33.966 --> 1:11:35.631
Nah, nah. It was amazing.

1:11:37.531 --> 1:11:40.799
But I couldn't find soph,
and you man weren't there,

1:11:40.866 --> 1:11:43.766
so we need a new plan
for midnight.

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:46.165
New plan? Sophie couldn't
get through to you.

1:11:46.232 --> 1:11:49.265
She called me, bruv.
She'll be there now, t.

1:11:49.332 --> 1:11:51.766
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1:11:51.833 --> 1:11:54.099
- Oh, shit, yeah.

1:11:54.165 --> 1:11:57.132
- Sophie, Sophie.
- Come on, man!

1:12:09.866 --> 1:12:11.899
I couldn't find her.

1:12:11.966 --> 1:12:14.175
She probably just changed her
mind and just went somewhere.

1:12:14.199 --> 1:12:16.265
- She'll be there, t.
- She'll be there, bro.

1:12:16.332 --> 1:12:17.833
Oh, shit!

1:12:17.899 --> 1:12:20.199
Wait, there!
Bruv, there, taxi rank.

1:12:20.265 --> 1:12:21.666
There, there, there,

1:12:21.733 --> 1:12:22.933
It's Sophie, t. She's waiting!

1:12:22.966 --> 1:12:25.065
Look! Look! Cap, stop the car!

1:12:25.132 --> 1:12:26.933
No, no, no. I can't, not here.

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.675
No, just chill man. Just let

1:12:28.699 --> 1:12:30.132
Just stop the fuckin' car, man!

1:12:30.199 --> 1:12:31.507
Nah, nah, nah,

1:12:31.531 --> 1:12:33.132
I can't stop.

1:12:34.598 --> 1:12:36.132
Aaah!

1:12:47.265 --> 1:12:49.565
Happy new year.

1:12:49.632 --> 1:12:51.531
Yo, go get your midnight kiss.

1:12:51.598 --> 1:12:53.699
She's waiting.

1:12:55.366 --> 1:12:58.165
- Alright, just, just...

1:12:58.232 --> 1:12:59.512
No, no, the red one,

1:13:01.165 --> 1:13:02.332

Gentle. Gentle like that, man!

1:13:09.733 --> 1:13:12.165
