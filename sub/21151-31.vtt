HE DOUBLE CROSSED THEM AND
DECIDED NOT TO USE THE VETO TO

03:58.238 --> 03:59.407
SAVE RAVEN.

03:59.440 --> 04:04.211
BUT IN DOING SO, THE ROAD YO
CLOWN HAS CAUSED A MAJOR RIFT

04:04.244 --> 04:06.780
BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS CLOSEST
ALLEYS.

EASY.

IT'S PART OF THE JOB.

04:38.446 --> 04:42.483
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME
>> TOUGHEST DECISION BY FAR HAD

04:42.516 --> 04:43.717
TO MAKE.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.886
GOING AGAINST THE GROUP IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO TAKE

04:45.919 --> 04:49.390
LIGHTLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
MAN, I JUST DIDN'T FEEL

04:49.423 --> 04:52.626
COMFORTABLE GOING WITH WHAT THEY
WERE THINKING.

04:52.660 --> 05:00.233

05:16.450 --> 05:20.988
>> MATT AND I BOTH PLAYED A
LOCAL GAME.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.191
IT SUCKS TO BE ON THE BLOCK WITH
MATT.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.193
I REFUSE TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST
HIM.

05:26.226 --> 05:30.764
WHATEVER HAPPENS, AT LEAST I CAN
BE HAPPY WITH MY GAME PLAY AND

05:30.798 --> 05:34.134
KNOW THAT I DIDN'T PLAY A DIRTY
GAME LIKE JASON

05:34.167 --> 05:37.805

AT LEAST BE A MAN AND COME
EXPLAIN YOU'RE DECISION

05:55.423 --> 05:58.392
>> I KNOW YOU ARE.

05:58.426 --> 06:02.696

HIM.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.933

GOING TO USE THE VETO.

TOGETHER INSTEAD OF PULLING MY

100% ON MY CHILDREN.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.618
WHOEVER ASK AROUND, GO AHEAD ASK
EVERYONE ELSE.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.620
SINCE YOU'RE ASKING ME.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.223
I VOTED FOR MARK.

12:03.256 --> 12:03.924
>> ALL RIGHT.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.126
ANYBODY ELSE?
>> MARK.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.462
>> I VOTED FOR MARK.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.263
>> ALEX?

12:10.297 --> 12:15.035
>> MARK.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.304
>> ONE MINUTE

12:17.337 --> 12:22.409

12:22.442 --> 12:23.643
YES OR NO?

12:23.676 --> 12:32.886
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY
>> MY GOD YOU'RE SUCH A PINUNK

12:32.920 --> 12:37.157
>> I'M ASKING IF YOU VOTED FOR
ME OR NOT

12:37.190 --> 12:37.624
>> TO GO HOME?

12:37.657 --> 12:41.494
>> YES
>> YES,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.263
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THE -- THERE
WAS TWO.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.132
>> YOU LIED YOU SAID
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THE OTHER

12:45.165 --> 12:47.935
ONE IS
>> YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW WHO THE

12:47.968 --> 12:49.069
TWO VOTES ARE.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.039
>> WHY WOULD I WANT TO THROW
MYSELF UNDER THE BUS?

12:52.072 --> 12:56.676
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU HONESTLY
>> YEAH, I'M GOING TO VOTE THAT.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.880
>> I FIGURED YOU WERE DOING IT
TO STIR THE POT

12:59.913 --> 13:03.416
>> I PLAY A LOYAL GAME THIS
ENTIRE TIME ON MY PACEMAKER

13:03.450 --> 13:05.618
WHICH I NEED TO LIVE.

13:05.652 --> 13:08.355
I NEED TO VOTE MATT OUT.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.289
>> SOMEBODY DID.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.491
>> SOMEONE DID.

13:11.524 --> 13:11.959
YEAH.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.628
BUT IT WASN'T ME.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.397
THAT'S HOW I ROLL.

13:17.430 --> 13:21.268
>> YEAH, I WAS THE SECOND VOTE
AGAINST MATT.

13:21.301 --> 13:26.907
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO JUMP
INTO THE PIT WITH JASON, I DON'T

13:26.940 --> 13:28.641
WANT TARGET ON MY BACK.

13:28.675 --> 13:36.917
>> LOYAL AND SEE HOW IT TELLS.

13:36.950 --> 13:41.421
>> Julie: UP NEXT THE FIGHTING
FAR FROM OVER AS THE HOUSE SETS

13:41.454 --> 13:43.723

13:43.756 --> 13:46.326
THEN THE VOTE AND EVICTION PLAY
OUT LIVE.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
STAY WITH

14:04.844 --> 14:07.447
*
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK.

14:07.480 --> 14:12.019
MATT AND RAVEN MAY BE MARKED FOR
EVICTION, BUT THEY AREN'T THE

14:12.052 --> 14:15.889
ONLY TARGETS IN THE HOUSE.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.558
>> THAT COULD HAVE WENT BETTER.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.962
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:21.995 --> 14:25.198
>> ZERO BONES THAT EVICT KNEE IN
ANY WAY

14:25.232 --> 14:34.574
>> I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD
TURNPIKE TURN UP LIKE THAT.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.808
>> NO.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.544
HE'S GOING TO GO GRAB
INFORMATION.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.148
>> DO YOU WANT ME STOP
>> THAT'S WHAT KEVIN IS DOING

14:41.181 --> 14:41.581
RIGHT NOW.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.815
>> MATT.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.086
I DIDN'T VOTE AGAINST YOU I'M
TELLING YOU ON MY BROTHER, I'M

TELLING YOU ON MY BROTHER,
SOMEONE GAIN EVERYBODY MAKE IT

14:48.989 --> 14:50.623
THINK IT WAS ME.

14:50.657 --> 14:55.862
>> I FEEL BAD I WANT HIM TO KNOW
ABOUT THE TRUTH THEY DID NOT

14:55.895 --> 14:57.797
VOTE AGAINST HIM.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.999
>> I'M GOING TO.

14:59.032 --> 14:59.499
I'M GOING TO.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.201
>> WHAT?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.870
HOW ARE YOU DOING, BIG GUY?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.038
>> GOOD.

15:05.072 --> 15:11.011
>> ONLY THING THAT HAPPENED IN
THERE TO UPSET ME WAS --

15:11.044 --> 15:13.413
>> I'M

15:13.446 --> 15:14.581
>> I DON'T KNOW.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.351
>> KEVIN, IF YOU LIE, YOU
DESERVE TO GET -- IF YOU BEEN

15:18.385 --> 15:22.055
STANDING UP THE WHOLE SHOW, YOU
DON'T DESERVE TO GET

15:22.089 --> 15:25.658
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME
>> I'M TELLING, DID YOU --

15:25.692 --> 15:28.495
ANYONE ELSE
>> THAT'S THE GAME WE SIGN UP

15:28.528 --> 15:30.497
FOR KEVIN
>> I'M PRETTY SURE YOU NEVER

15:30.530 --> 15:32.365
REALLY TALKED TO MATT BEFORE.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.502
AND YOU CONSTANTLY SAY HOW HE
DOES NOTHING IN THIS GAME.

15:35.535 --> 15:44.744
NOW THAT HE'S GOING TO JURY,
YOU'RE CHUMMY WITH HIM.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.514
THINK AGAIN, PAL.

15:47.547 --> 15:54.254
>> EVERYBODY ELSE GOES AROUND
HERE LYING.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.456
IT AIN'T FAIR.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.126
GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME.

15:59.159 --> 16:03.130
HE'S TRYING TO THE JURY BECAUSE
HE HAS CONFRONTATION WITH HIM

16:03.163 --> 16:12.405
>> THEY WALK UP AND THEY GO --
>> EVERYBODY

16:12.439 --> 16:15.775
>> I REALIZE THAT THERE'S A
PATTERN HERE WITH KEVIN.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.612
HE LIKES TO BECOME BEST FRIEND
WITH EVERYBODY HEADING TO JURY.

16:19.646 --> 16:24.317
CODY WALKED IN THE YARD WITH
HIM, ELENA MAKING GRILL CHEESES,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.953
MARK WITH HIM IN THE MORNING AND
NOW MATT.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.090
IT'S FUNNY, KEVIN BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T TALK TO THESE PEOPLE UP

16:30.123 --> 16:34.994
TO THE POINT THAT THEY WERE
HEADING TO JURY AND I'VE KIND OF

16:35.028 --> 16:42.135
HAD ENOUGH OF IT.

16:42.169 --> 16:42.935
*.

16:42.969 --> 16:48.308
*
>> TOO HOT OUT THERE, KEVIN

16:48.341 --> 16:51.178
>> YES, REALLY HOT
>> ARE YOU GOING TO GO SWIM

16:51.211 --> 16:54.947
>> ABSOLUTELY, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
CHRISTMAS?

16:54.981 --> 16:57.684
>> I CAN'T SWIM
>> SIT IN THE POOL

16:57.717 --> 17:01.621
>> YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THAT
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD

17:01.654 --> 17:02.622
ASK ME THAT.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.824
ARE YOU TRYING TO

17:04.857 --> 17:06.159
>> ARE YOU JOKING?

17:06.193 --> 17:09.496
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT IT
UP, NOT ME.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.800
>> KEVIN, I WAS RIGHT HERE.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.767
DON'T LIE.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.703
>> MY GOD.

17:16.736 --> 17:22.842
>> ARE YOU GOING TO IN THE POOL
>> I DID ASK HIM FIRST.

17:22.875 --> 17:27.046
>> DON'T YELL AT ME.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.550
DON'T GO THERE WITH ME.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.586
>> DROP IT.

17:33.620 --> 17:38.225
DROP IT.

17:38.258 --> 17:43.130
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.298
>> I'M NOT A LIAR.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.035
I WANT TO ADDRESS IT.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.903
I'M NOT GOING TO BE PUT UP TO BE
A LIAR.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.073
>> I DIDN'T LIE.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.777
>> SET YOU UP
>> NOBODY IS SETTING ME UP.

17:57.810 --> 18:03.015
>> I'M NOT REALLY ON TO YOUR --
>> YOU PLAYED YOURSELF.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.452
>> I WON'T ANSWER YOUR
CONVERSATION.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.188
>> YOU'RE A LIAR.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.056
>> NO.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.023
>> GAME.

18:11.057 --> 18:15.528
>> CALL ME --
>> 25 K, KEVIN.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.964
>> YOU TELL ME WHO WON THE 25 K?

18:17.997 --> 18:21.934
>> ON DAY ONE IN THIS HOUSE,
THERE WAS A $25000 TEMPTATION

18:21.968 --> 18:23.636
AND SOMEBODY CLAIMED IT.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.871
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.039
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS THAT IT WAS
KEVIN.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.509
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN YOU CLAIM
THAT YOU'RE NOT A LIAR, WHY

18:29.542 --> 18:32.245
DON'T YOU COME CLEAN ABOUT THIS
ONE?

18:32.279 --> 18:35.382
>> YOU TOLD ME YOU DID: YOU
DID.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.484
>> YOU DID
>> YOU DID.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.951
>> SWEAR ON YOUR KID.

18:38.985 --> 18:44.491
>> ON MY KIDS NAME? DON'T BRING
MY KIDS UP.

18:44.524 --> 18:48.027
>> I'M A BIG -- CALLING YOU OUT.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.930
>> I DIDN'T HAVE THE
CONVERSATION.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.767
>> THIS IS A GAME.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.304
>> EVERYONE SETTING HIM UP.

18:57.337 --> 19:03.976
>> WHO'S SETTING ME UP?
>> ARE YOU

19:04.010 --> 19:05.345
THIS IS A GAME.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.814
>> KEVIN, IT AIN'T WORTH IT.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.716
>> THEY WANT THE NEXT PERSON TO
GO UP.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.651
THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BE THEM.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.721
IF THEY CAN DIVERT THAT
INFORMATION ABOUT ANOTHER

19:14.754 --> 19:16.523
HOUSEGUEST, BOOM, THAT
HOUSEGUEST WENT AGAINST THEM.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.791
LET'S PUT HIM OR HER UP.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.692
THAT'S THE GAME.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.794
SO THEY'RE BAITING EVERYBODY TO
PUT ME UP.

19:21.828 --> 19:26.366
I'M A STAND-UP GUY FROM BOSTON,
MY WORD IS MY BOND.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.635
ALL BOSTON GUYS ARE THE SAME.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.538
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY MIND BLOWING
TO ME HOW THESE PEOPLE JUST TAKE

19:31.571 --> 19:34.374
THE BATE I LEAVE OUT THERE AND
RUN WITH IT.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.243
NOW JASON IS A HUGE TARGET.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.577
KEVIN IS HUGE TARGET.

19:37.610 --> 19:42.982
SO MANY TARGETS OUT THERE AND
NOT ONE IS ME.

19:43.015 --> 19:48.688
HA HA HA.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.155
* .

19:49.188 --> 19:49.789
* .

19:49.822 --> 19:55.895
>> I GOT IT.

19:55.928 --> 19:59.899
>> HEY, HEY HEY, COME OVER HERE,
JOSH, COME OVER HERE.

19:59.932 --> 20:04.471
DON'T LET THEM WALK BY DOOR AND
SEE THIS, COME HERE.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.840
SIT IN THAT DON'T BACK TOWARDS
THE WALL.

20:07.874 --> 20:14.614
RIGHT THERE BACK TOWARDS THE
WALL SO THEY CAN'T SEE YOU'RE

20:14.647 --> 20:17.817
FACE
>> WHY IS IT I'M ALWAYS GETTING

20:17.850 --> 20:18.385
THREATENED?

20:18.418 --> 20:20.152
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE REAL.

20:20.186 --> 20:20.853
COME HERE.

20:20.887 --> 20:21.988
PLEASE, PLEASE.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.656
PLEASE.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.360
WHY DID YOU DO THAT
>> I LOST IT.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.160
>> I KNOW.

20:28.194 --> 20:31.097
BUT THAT'S -- THAT WAS MY
POSITION.

20:31.130 --> 20:36.869
OK?

20:36.903 --> 20:42.174
I KNOW, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT THIS
WAY.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.644
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THE 25 K
THING

20:44.677 --> 20:45.912
>> IT'S GOOD.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.316
>> JOSH IS REALLY UPSET BUT HE
DOESN'T REALLIES THAT BRINGING

20:49.349 --> 20:53.553
UP THE $25000 ACTUALLY GOT US
GOOD INFO, KEVIN SWORE ON HIS

20:53.586 --> 20:56.389
KIDS WHEN MATT CONFRONTED HIM
ABOUT THE ROGUE VOTE.

20:56.423 --> 21:01.661
>> WOULD YOU SWEAR ON YOUR KIDS
AN HOURS AGO, HE COULDN'T DO IT

21:01.694 --> 21:06.433
>> WHEN JOSH ASKED HIM ABOUT THE
$25,000, KEVIN BLEW UP, GOT

21:06.466 --> 21:09.302
DEFENDS AND REFUSED TO SWEAR ON
HIS KIDS

21:09.336 --> 21:12.204
>> IT CONFIRMS ALEX.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.374
>> YEAH.

21:14.407 --> 21:17.844
>> FOR ME THAT WAS A CLEAR
INDICATOR THAT ALEX WAS THE

21:17.877 --> 21:20.680
SECOND VOTE TO EVICT MATT.

21:20.713 --> 21:24.250
THIS CONFIRMS ALEX IS SUPER
DANGEROUS IN THIS GAME.

21:24.283 --> 21:29.522
SHE NEEDS TO GO UP WITH HER
COWBOY AND GET THE HECK OUT OF

21:29.556 --> 21:30.323
HERE.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.724
>> WE HAVE TO GET JASON AND ALEX
OUT.

21:31.758 --> 21:39.466
>>
>> Julie: CODY ELENA AND MARK

21:39.499 --> 21:41.200
MOVE INTO THE JURY HOUSE.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.771
THEN IT'S THE LIVE VOTE AND
EVICTION.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.705
MATT OR RAVEN?

21:45.738 --> 21:47.507
THE FINAL SHOW MANS COMES TO AN
END TONIGHT

22:12.331 --> 22:14.501
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO BIG
BROTHER.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.568
CODY LEAN AND MARK.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.770
THEY MAY NOT BE PLAYING BIG
BROTHER ANYMORE.

22:17.804 --> 22:22.675
BUT AFTER TWO WEEKS IN THE JURY
HOUSE, THEY'RE STARTING TO

22:22.709 --> 22:25.077
REALIZE, THEY'VE BEEN PLAYED.

22:25.111 --> 22:25.745
* .

22:25.778 --> 22:29.181
* .

22:29.215 --> 22:33.686
>> GETTING EVICTED FROM THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE, I'M OUT OF THE

22:33.720 --> 22:35.287
RUNNING FOR $500000.

22:35.321 --> 22:39.792
THE ONLY BENEFIT OF BEING VOTED
OUT FIRST IS THAT I'M AWAY FROM

22:39.826 --> 22:45.331
THOSE LUNATICS AS LONG AS
POSSIBLE.

22:45.364 --> 22:49.201
MARK AND ELENA WERE THE MOST
VULNERABLE.

22:49.235 --> 22:51.270
IT WOULD BE COOL IF THEY VOTED
OFF PAUL.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.741
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'D HAVE TO
SPEND A BUNCH OF TIME WITH HIM

22:54.774 --> 22:57.710
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.277
* .

22:58.310 --> 23:00.012
* .

23:00.046 --> 23:03.783
>> I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED
TO SEE ME.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.017
>> ALL RIGHT.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.286
SORT OF GLAD TO SEE YOU.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.289
>> MY EVICTION WAS NOT A
SURPRISE.

23:10.322 --> 23:15.862
I FELT PRETTY CONFIDENT I WAS
THE NEXT TARGET AFTER CODY LEFT.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.196
>> WHO WAS IT?

23:17.229 --> 23:20.533
>> JASON,
>> WAS A LOSER

23:20.567 --> 23:22.702
>> ME AND MARK WERE NEXT.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.703
>> ALL RIGHT.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.373
>> JOSH THE NEXT TWO TO
FACE-OFF,

23:27.406 --> 23:31.711
>> MARK AND ELENA,
>> MARK OR I HAVE TO WIN OR

23:31.744 --> 23:34.914
WE'RE GOING UP.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.950
>> Julie: ELENA YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

23:37.984 --> 23:42.722
>> THIS GUY IS JUST STEAM
ROLLING HIS WAY TO 500,000

23:42.755 --> 23:45.357
>> THEY'RE PLAYING BIG PAUL.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.959
>> Julie: IT'S TIME FOR THE
POWER OF VETO COMPETITION.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.128
>> COME ON, MARK.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.831
>> CONGRATULATIONS MARK.

23:51.864 --> 23:52.932
YOU HAVE WON.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.634
THE POWER OF VETO.

23:54.667 --> 23:58.404
>> MARK WINS I'M HAPPY BUT ALSO
I KNOW 100% LEAVING.

23:58.437 --> 24:03.943
>> ELENA YOU'RE EVICTED FROM THE
BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

24:03.976 --> 24:04.911
>> WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE OUT?

24:04.944 --> 24:08.047
WHO DO THIS,
>> PAUL IS RUNNING THE HOUSE.

24:08.080 --> 24:14.186
