WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.880
I didn't know who else to call.

00:04.423 --> 00:06.049
That's OK.

00:06.883 --> 00:08.051
I was up.

00:08.552 --> 00:10.345
You can't sleep?

00:12.347 --> 00:14.141
Not since Daniel.

00:15.225 --> 00:17.769
I just can't stop thinking
about Sharon.

00:17.894 --> 00:19.521
Out there in that field.

00:21.606 --> 00:24.234
When the police come back to you,
stick to your story.

00:24.735 --> 00:27.320
Bing killed Sharon.
He knows who took Haley.

00:27.446 --> 00:30.198
I already gave them a statement.
Why would they come back?

00:30.615 --> 00:33.034
To fill the hole in your story.

00:33.577 --> 00:37.038
A hole the size and shape
of a magical bridge.

00:38.248 --> 00:40.834
If you tell them
that's how you found Sharon,

00:40.959 --> 00:44.212
or that a man with a magical car
wants to meet you...

00:45.964 --> 00:48.091
Charlie Manx.

00:49.468 --> 00:51.136
That's his name.

00:55.348 --> 00:57.642
Get some sleep, Brat.
You're going to need it.

02:22.727 --> 02:24.020
Hey!

03:32.088 --> 03:33.798
Your coffee, madame.

03:34.299 --> 03:35.884
Thank you.

03:41.765 --> 03:43.975
You know, I got to tell you...

03:44.768 --> 03:48.104
you kind of scared me
in the garage this morning.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.898
Sorry. I'll clean it up.

03:59.824 --> 04:03.078
You know, my first tour in Kuwait,
I was a driver.

04:04.037 --> 04:06.373
In an armored truck convoy.

04:08.625 --> 04:13.296
And I had been there a couple weeks,
you know, getting the hang of it.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.465
Doing good, you know.

04:16.216 --> 04:17.257
Feeling OK.

04:19.010 --> 04:21.387
Things almost seeming normal,
you know?

04:21.512 --> 04:23.306
And then...

04:25.725 --> 04:30.146
Then the lead truck in the convoy
gets blown sky-high.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.360
And later, I...

04:36.653 --> 04:39.114
I recognize Ricky Gibbons' hand.

04:40.115 --> 04:42.993
Because we got
the same tattoo one night.

04:43.118 --> 04:44.953
Being stupid, you know?

04:49.290 --> 04:50.542
I was your age.

04:53.128 --> 04:55.588
- It's not the same, Dad.
- Hold on.

04:58.091 --> 04:59.801
I never talked about it.

05:03.013 --> 05:04.639
I just...

05:08.601 --> 05:12.022
And it...
you know, it poisoned me.

05:12.981 --> 05:15.817
Just keeping everything inside.

05:26.828 --> 05:28.788
I don't want that for you.

05:30.957 --> 05:32.500
I'm OK.

05:34.627 --> 05:35.920
I am.

05:40.717 --> 05:42.969
You know, if you want
to talk about...

05:43.887 --> 05:45.180
Haley...

05:45.305 --> 05:48.892
or, you know,
you want to talk about Sharon,

05:49.017 --> 05:51.061
anything, Vic, I'm here for you.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.400
It's OK to talk about stuff.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.117
Dad...

06:07.577 --> 06:08.828
Yeah.

06:15.627 --> 06:17.128
I'm fine.

06:19.255 --> 06:21.299
I am. I'm just tired.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.721
Alright.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.489
Jesus, Vicky.

06:44.614 --> 06:48.368
Did you get any sleep at all?
I told you to ice that eye.

06:48.910 --> 06:50.912
I just came to pick up my bike.

06:51.037 --> 06:54.415
Maybe we should start to think
about a car for you. Huh?

06:57.502 --> 06:58.586
I prefer my bike.

06:59.212 --> 07:01.798
You're out riding it,
you always come back sick.

07:01.923 --> 07:03.967
I won't do that anymore.

07:04.634 --> 07:07.137
What were you doing in that field?
Were you with Craig?

07:07.262 --> 07:08.513
What? No.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.056
Look, Mom, can we...

07:10.807 --> 07:14.018
Can we not do this? I just want
to get my bike and go to class.

07:14.644 --> 07:16.020
What's the hold-up?

07:16.146 --> 07:18.523
That death trap you bought
has got to go.

07:18.648 --> 07:20.692
- No. I need my bike.
- Vic's a great rider.

07:20.817 --> 07:23.862
She's a great rider? Have you seen
your daughter's eye, Chris?

07:23.987 --> 07:27.073
- Yeah, we discussed it. She's fine.
- Oh, you discussed it?

07:27.198 --> 07:29.534
You're a doctor now?
This is very good to know.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.412
You and Tiffany,
you should open a practice together.

07:32.537 --> 07:34.414
You would really clean up.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.833
Victoria McQueen?

07:37.500 --> 07:38.459
Yeah.

07:39.961 --> 07:41.754
I'm Detective Tabitha Hutter.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.591
I've been assigned
to the Sharon and Haley Smith case.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.760
Is this a bad time?

07:51.973 --> 07:55.435
Let's start with Sharon Smith's body.
How did you find it?

07:57.896 --> 08:02.150
Well, I was riding home
on my dirtbike...

08:04.444 --> 08:06.112
...when I saw these...

08:07.113 --> 08:11.075
...all these crows
pecking around in the dirt, and...

08:11.951 --> 08:13.494
yeah, it was her.

08:14.579 --> 08:18.082
So, you saw some crows,
stopped on your dirtbike,

08:18.208 --> 08:20.376
and decided to dig?

08:22.921 --> 08:23.963
Yes.

08:26.966 --> 08:28.509
Where were you coming from?

08:30.220 --> 08:32.013
Bing Partridge's house.

08:33.014 --> 08:34.182
Bing Partridge?

08:34.307 --> 08:36.976
The custodian you allege
committed the murder?

08:37.101 --> 08:39.979
And helped kidnap Haley, yeah.
Have you arrested him?

08:40.647 --> 08:42.357
What were you doing at his home?

08:45.109 --> 08:47.904
We trade comic books.
I wanted to return an issue.

08:48.029 --> 08:50.406
You're friends
with a middle-aged custodian?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.952
We're not friends anymore.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.503
Did you see Bing kill Sharon
or dispose of the body?

09:04.462 --> 09:06.881
No, but he said he made her clean.

09:09.550 --> 09:13.054
And then after,
Bing, he just let you go?

09:14.097 --> 09:15.807
No. I escaped.

09:16.933 --> 09:19.227
You escaped on your dirtbike,

09:19.769 --> 09:22.730
stumbled across some crows,
dug up Sharon Smith's body,

09:22.855 --> 09:25.525
and assumed
Bing Partridge jumped her there?

09:29.028 --> 09:30.280
Yes.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.662
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Maybe.

09:37.787 --> 09:41.082
You're just...
not telling me all of it.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.502
OK, you need
to arrest Bing Partridge.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.048
There's my card,
in case you remember anything else.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.365
I was going to redo the kitchen
with these.

10:14.866 --> 10:16.784
I'll get some turpentine.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.580
That's not going to help.
I mean, these are ruined.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.751
Damn.

10:24.876 --> 10:28.671
Girl, I worked extra shifts
for months to buy this linoleum.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.591
Well, I will pay you back.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.427
Yeah! You're in high school.

10:37.597 --> 10:39.307
Sorry, Tiffany.

10:40.475 --> 10:43.895
Yeah, I'm sorry, too, Vic.
I'm sorry for what you saw...

10:44.020 --> 10:45.605
What I saw...

10:46.147 --> 10:50.151
was my neighbor, Sharon, murdered,
naked, with a nail in her head.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.820
Her daughter is missing
but by all means, please,

10:52.945 --> 10:54.614
tell me more about your linoleum.

10:57.992 --> 11:00.661
Yeah. I didn't sign up for this.

11:02.872 --> 11:06.459
Alright, ladies, the garage can wait.
I got grinders.

11:06.584 --> 11:10.171
Ham, cheese, extra pickles,
coke for the Brat.

11:10.296 --> 11:13.841
Italian works,
Diet 7Up for my baby-baby.

11:13.966 --> 11:18.638
Oh, you know, your baby-baby
was just telling me that she...

11:19.430 --> 11:21.391
she didn't sign up for this.

11:21.933 --> 11:24.227
- I think she meant me.
- What? No.

11:25.061 --> 11:27.146
No, I'm sure
that's not what she meant.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.731
Tiff?

11:31.109 --> 11:33.319
She should be with her mother.

11:44.497 --> 11:48.126
Well, is that you think?
I should live with Mom?

11:54.465 --> 11:56.384
I'm your daughter.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.642
OK.

12:58.905 --> 13:01.240
Bing Partridge,
I know you're in there.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.534
I advise you open the door.

13:19.634 --> 13:21.135
What's going on here, Bing?

13:21.260 --> 13:24.096
Why weren't you outside
to greet me when I arrived?

13:24.722 --> 13:28.100
Something's happened, Mr Manx.
Something bad.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.440
Would you like to take a seat?

13:36.067 --> 13:37.652
I'll stand.

13:38.653 --> 13:40.154
Tell me what happened.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.533
I hope you won't be angry.

13:43.658 --> 13:46.911
Does it perchance have anything
to do with Vic McQueen?

13:50.081 --> 13:52.792
I was real careful,
hiding the mother.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.086
But Vic found her.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.298
Did she, now?

13:59.423 --> 14:01.217
She told the police.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.136
They came by
and left a card in my door.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.641
You were hiding from them?

14:08.766 --> 14:10.268
I'm so sorry, Mr Manx.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.150
I understand if you want to fire me.

14:18.276 --> 14:19.485
Fire you?

14:19.610 --> 14:23.364
For goodness sake, what kind
of monster do you take me for?

14:23.864 --> 14:27.994
Body disposal is by far the most
difficult aspect of your job.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.746
Thank you, sir.

14:30.871 --> 14:34.083
Neither you nor I could have foreseen
the resourcefulness

14:34.208 --> 14:37.044
of our intrepid Vic McQueen.

14:39.171 --> 14:42.049
Vic says what I did
to the mother was wrong.

14:44.552 --> 14:48.472
Then obviously she had no idea
what was going on inside that house.

14:50.099 --> 14:54.270
You found a prophylactic
in the living area, did you not?

14:54.770 --> 14:58.482
Where young Haley, a child of ten,
could have discovered it?

14:59.442 --> 15:02.486
It was in the trash can.
It was used.

15:05.573 --> 15:08.784
That wanton didn't deserve
to be called "mommy."

15:08.909 --> 15:11.162
You saved that child's life, Bing.

15:11.662 --> 15:16.125
There will always be those
who don't understand the work we do.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.087
But we can't let
their permissive attitudes prevent us

15:20.212 --> 15:22.965
from saving even one child.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.176
Now, chin up.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.804
You're going to the police.

15:31.349 --> 15:33.601
You want me to turn myself in?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.063
I don't like policemen, Mr Manx.

15:37.188 --> 15:41.233
I find it always best
to face your problems head-on.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.736
No more hiding.

15:44.445 --> 15:47.782
Tell me, what is the name
of your favorite television program?

15:48.407 --> 15:49.659
Monster Trucks.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.997
And was Monster Trucks on last night?

15:55.581 --> 15:57.625
- All night, every night.
- Perfection.

15:58.292 --> 16:01.587
Now listen closely, Bing Partridge,
because what you do next

16:01.712 --> 16:04.840
will determine
the future of our relationship.

16:06.467 --> 16:11.514
I work for Massachusetts
Custodial and Security Services.

16:12.223 --> 16:14.225
They send me to two places.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.852
I did my shift at Sochempharm

16:16.977 --> 16:21.107
and then I headed to William White
Memorial High School,

16:21.691 --> 16:23.275
and then home.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.195
I watched television all night long.

16:26.696 --> 16:29.615
Monster Trucks.
It's my favorite show.

16:30.825 --> 16:35.079
And then I got up, and I did
the same thing all over again.

16:37.373 --> 16:39.333
Anyone who can confirm all that?

16:40.918 --> 16:43.254
Well, both my supervisors.

16:43.713 --> 16:45.673
And Victoria McQueen.

16:45.798 --> 16:47.550
When did you see Victoria McQueen?

16:47.675 --> 16:51.220
She came by yesterday
to return a comic book.

16:51.846 --> 16:52.847
She's my friend.

16:54.432 --> 16:55.558
That all?

16:59.353 --> 17:02.481
Are you... more than friends?

17:04.150 --> 17:05.108
No.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.111
You ever wish you were?

17:07.987 --> 17:09.113
Vic's a pretty girl.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.157
- No.
- She's not a pretty girl?

17:12.282 --> 17:15.828
Yeah. No. Yeah.
She is. It's just...

17:15.953 --> 17:17.704
Just...

17:19.707 --> 17:20.875
She's in high school.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.545
She's 18. Age of consent.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.720
Tell me about the youth facility.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.059
Those records are sealed.

17:39.185 --> 17:41.187
You weren't much younger than Vic.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.316
Those records are sealed.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.945
Was your crime
sexual in nature, Bing?

17:51.781 --> 17:56.035
I work for Massachusetts
Custodial and Security Services.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.496
They send me to two places.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.539
I did my shift at Sochempharm,

18:00.664 --> 18:03.459
and then I headed to William White
Memorial High School.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.628
And then home.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.589
I watched television all night long.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.675
- Monster Trucks...
- Yeah. Your favorite show.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.304
Told you there was
something wrong with that guy.

18:15.846 --> 18:19.225
No one ever believes me but I'm
a pretty good judge of character.

18:19.767 --> 18:22.812
Nobody ever believes you
because you're always stoned.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.649
That's what your mom thinks
you're doing. In the woods.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.573
You found Sharon with that bridge,
didn't you?

18:39.787 --> 18:43.207
I know I promised
not to use it again,

18:43.332 --> 18:44.875
but I didn't have a choice, OK?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.254
I said it a thousand times.
Your heart's too big, Vic.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.506
Too big and too dumb.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.722
Want to get out of here?

18:59.306 --> 19:01.267
- Play hooky for once in your life?
- No.

19:01.392 --> 19:02.393
Come on.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.062
Craig, I have
to finish this portfolio

19:05.187 --> 19:07.064
so I can get out of here for good.

19:11.402 --> 19:12.945
RISD...

19:16.448 --> 19:18.325
You should apply too.

19:20.369 --> 19:23.998
Yeah. We both know the only reason
I took this class was to be near you.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.930
You're the best part
about this town, Vic.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.686
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.401
There's a party later at Willa's
if you want to come.

19:53.319 --> 19:55.070
Tea and Crumpets gonna be there?

19:58.866 --> 20:00.618
I'd rather go swim at Amity Island.

20:01.327 --> 20:02.578
Craig...

20:07.416 --> 20:09.793
"They got city hands, Chief.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.296
Been counting money
all their lives."

20:12.421 --> 20:14.089
OK, you're not Captain Quint.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.800
I bet those pricks
have never even seen Jaws.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.346
It's a classic.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.812
I'll see you later, nerdball.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.148
Craig.

20:53.796 --> 20:55.547
You're supposed to be in jail.

20:57.216 --> 20:59.343
Murmur. Chit-chat.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.136
Gossip. Prattle.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.265
Everyone knows
true friends don't tattle.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.518
We're not friends, Bing.

21:09.645 --> 21:12.314
That lady policeman
you snitched to...

21:13.565 --> 21:15.526
She doesn't have any evidence.

21:16.068 --> 21:20.239
- Mr Manx says I did nothing wrong.
- Then Mr Manx is a liar.

21:28.998 --> 21:30.708
He says, come alone.

21:41.802 --> 21:45.180
He's a strong creative
that's been taking kids for decades.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.684
And still nobody has found them.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.980
I think he's taking them
to his inscape.

21:53.856 --> 21:57.234
Maybe if we find out what that is,
your bridge can take us there.

21:59.028 --> 22:00.821
Maybe it can't.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.699
Last time I tried,
it took me to Bing's.

22:04.742 --> 22:06.910
You were looking for Haley.

22:08.037 --> 22:09.872
And she was in the Wraith.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.251
What if your bridge
can only take you to a fixed point?

22:14.877 --> 22:17.212
It's a bridge.
It can't take you to a moving car.

22:20.007 --> 22:22.593
He must have left Bing's
right before I got there.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.807
Tomorrow...

22:30.476 --> 22:33.437
...you have to find out much
about his inscape as you can.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.774
- I'll drive.
- No.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.486
No way. He said come alone.

22:40.611 --> 22:42.654
You can't take your dirtbike.

22:42.780 --> 22:45.908
If he finds out what your knife is,
or if anything happens to it,

22:46.033 --> 22:47.868
you'll lose access to your bridge.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.287
OK.

22:56.835 --> 23:00.589
While you're meeting with him,
I'll find the car and get the plate.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.467
Something concrete
that we can take to the police.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.180
We can do this.

23:09.223 --> 23:12.017
My tiles told me,
"The Brat will find the Wraith."

23:15.187 --> 23:17.439
Did they say I'd survive?

23:19.191 --> 23:21.110
I'm sure you will.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.738
Go home.

23:25.781 --> 23:29.201
- Sleep.
- No, I can't sleep.

23:30.786 --> 23:33.956
And I definitely cannot go home.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.631
When did you graduate high school?

23:45.092 --> 23:46.593
Why?

23:59.148 --> 24:01.859
Drunk teenagers. Awesome.

24:12.786 --> 24:13.954
Vic!

24:14.079 --> 24:18.125
Oh, my God, I've been texting you.
You're all over my feed. You OK?

24:18.250 --> 24:19.376
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:20.169 --> 24:23.338
- Something for your troubles?
- Vic doesn't drink, so...

24:30.512 --> 24:33.724
- Can I have another?
- Damn, bitch, finish mine.

24:36.310 --> 24:38.353
You alkie whore!

24:39.188 --> 24:41.356
- Who's your friend?
- I'm Maggie.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.541
- Is this Scrabble?
- Don't touch that.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.377
It contains
the mysteries of the universe.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.096
Hi.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.099
I thought you'd never make it out.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.270
Yeah, I had to placate my fans.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.606
Yeah, I saw that.

25:25.859 --> 25:26.944
Are you OK?

25:29.279 --> 25:31.698
I almost drowned in that pool
when I was a kid.

25:32.866 --> 25:35.202
- How old were you?
- About eight.

25:45.087 --> 25:47.214
Yeah, Willa had these...

25:48.507 --> 25:51.176
...these two cousins visiting
for the summer.

25:52.427 --> 25:54.346
And they were older.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.140
Teenage boys.

25:59.101 --> 26:01.395
Willa and I were playing
with our Barbies,

26:01.520 --> 26:04.273
and they just grabbed me
and threw me in.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.943
Held me underwater
by my ankles and wrists

26:08.068 --> 26:10.612
until I thought
my lungs would explode.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.116
I just felt like I was
between worlds or something.

26:16.201 --> 26:17.869
Life and death.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.832
Reality and thought.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.508
You know, there are
some people in the world...

26:33.468 --> 26:35.554
...whose imaginations
are so powerful,

26:35.679 --> 26:37.973
they can pull
their private world of thought

26:38.098 --> 26:39.558
into the physical world

26:39.683 --> 26:41.810
by tearing the fabric
between the two.

26:44.980 --> 26:47.024
I'm one of those people.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.574
You know, scientists say...

26:56.325 --> 26:58.201
time and space is infinite.

27:00.037 --> 27:02.998
There are billions of me's
and billions of you's.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.334
Billions of dimensions.

27:10.422 --> 27:15.177
Whatever we can think of,
whatever we can dream...

27:17.054 --> 27:18.889
...has already happened...

27:19.973 --> 27:22.476
...or is happening right now
somewhere else.

27:24.061 --> 27:25.354
So...

27:28.148 --> 27:29.816
So you believe me?

27:31.151 --> 27:32.569
Yeah.

27:33.779 --> 27:35.113
I believe you.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.671
That was my first kiss.

27:52.964 --> 27:55.926
You are my first kiss.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.719
Well, no.

27:57.844 --> 28:01.473
There was that one time
with Joey Ricci, but I was five.

28:01.973 --> 28:04.267
So that probably
doesn't really count.

28:05.936 --> 28:07.312
Well, did I...

28:07.896 --> 28:11.733
Did I live up to,
or fail the expectations

28:11.858 --> 28:14.069
set out by young Joey Ricci?

28:15.445 --> 28:17.364
You lived up to 'em.

28:18.532 --> 28:19.783
Definitely.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.870
Well, let's go for "surpass."

28:36.007 --> 28:37.050
Come on.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.638
Hi, Maggie. Bye, Maggie!

28:46.560 --> 28:47.561
Edible?

28:47.686 --> 28:51.690
I'm sober. But you can tell me
about Michael Jackson over there.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.527
Drew Butler.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.780
Hasn't stopped talking about Vic
since Labor Day.

28:59.239 --> 29:02.284
It's so nice to see her having fun.
Her parents suck.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.703
Then again, all parents suck,
especially mine.

29:06.746 --> 29:12.294
They've given you this nice house
and nice clothes and an education!

29:12.919 --> 29:14.796
- That's, like, their job.
- Yeah!

29:14.921 --> 29:17.215
Don't tell me, you love your parents.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.427
I'm an orphan.

29:31.521 --> 29:34.983
How old were you
when your parents died?

29:35.525 --> 29:36.610
They're not dead.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.779
They disowned me.

29:39.905 --> 29:42.365
Because I'm unholy.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.369
Watch this.

29:50.415 --> 29:54.836
Who is the coolest girl
at Exeter Academy?

30:01.426 --> 30:03.553
I'll check the circuit breaker.

30:05.055 --> 30:06.848
I'll be back with drinks.

30:13.271 --> 30:16.441
"Beans."
That mean anything to you?

30:21.988 --> 30:24.115
My mother called me that
when I was a baby.

30:24.241 --> 30:26.701
It's a pretty cute nickname
from someone who sucks.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.042
How do you know Vic?

30:35.418 --> 30:36.836
I'm her ride.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.100
- Oh, hey.
- Hi!

30:50.225 --> 30:53.019
Hi. It's late. You are so drunk.

30:53.144 --> 30:56.648
And we have a date
with Charlie Manx in eight hours.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.150
- Damn it.
- We have to go.

31:00.318 --> 31:03.405
I know. I know. Let's go.

31:12.914 --> 31:16.084
Man, this place is awesome.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.882
Take these and drink this.
You'll thank me in the morning.

31:26.136 --> 31:27.262
You're awesome.

31:37.022 --> 31:38.940
Get some sleep, Brat.

31:44.988 --> 31:47.198
Waiting is the worst.

31:55.749 --> 31:58.460
I trashed
my dad's girlfriend's garage.

32:04.174 --> 32:06.092
It was after Sharon.

32:08.637 --> 32:10.764
After using my bridge.

32:13.058 --> 32:14.726
I was painting, and...

32:16.019 --> 32:17.312
...I scared him.

32:21.483 --> 32:25.737
The first time my mom caught me
using my Scrabble bag,

32:26.529 --> 32:28.615
she sent me to see our pastor.

32:36.039 --> 32:38.917
They thought something
was wrong with me.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.961
That I was bad.

32:42.712 --> 32:47.342
Yeah, my dad used to think
I was... the greatest,

32:47.467 --> 32:49.844
when everyone else thought
I was a weirdo.

32:51.680 --> 32:55.475
And... you know,
he would always take my side...

32:56.226 --> 32:57.977
and make me feel like...

33:01.106 --> 33:03.108
...well, like I belonged.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.735
No matter what,
I belonged with him.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.070
But...

33:11.408 --> 33:12.867
I don't know.

33:14.953 --> 33:18.748
I don't think I'll ever belong
anywhere ever again.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.170
Your bridge brought you to me.

33:25.505 --> 33:28.133
So maybe people like us
belong with each other.

33:31.469 --> 33:33.596
It might not matter after tomorrow.

33:36.141 --> 33:38.017
There's only one of him.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.145
Two of us.

34:51.841 --> 34:53.842
You're younger than I thought.

34:54.886 --> 34:56.763
You're almost a child.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.642
What have you done with Haley?

35:01.226 --> 35:04.646
Rushing to the end
before we've finished the beginning?

35:05.396 --> 35:09.234
Patience, Miss McQueen. You and I
have a great deal to discuss.

35:11.736 --> 35:13.238
Please...

35:18.618 --> 35:20.161
Sit with me.

35:31.381 --> 35:34.717
The first time you used your bridge,
I could feel it.

35:36.261 --> 35:37.887
An arrhythmia.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.265
Static came over the radio.

35:40.390 --> 35:43.101
I knew you must be
extraordinarily gifted

35:43.226 --> 35:45.353
to be able to disrupt my Wraith.

35:48.273 --> 35:50.358
Then came the dreams.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.445
I never had the pleasure
of seeing your face

35:54.571 --> 35:57.782
but I did dream other things
I knew were related to you.

35:58.616 --> 36:00.118
A river.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.996
A man's watch.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.249
The bats.

36:09.669 --> 36:12.422
You'll want to be careful
of those bats.

36:13.047 --> 36:15.550
Our inscapes are
manifestations of our minds,

36:15.675 --> 36:19.304
so if all the bats fly
out of your bridge...

36:21.264 --> 36:23.224
Well, you understand the metaphor.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.477
What does your inscape say
about your mind?

36:27.312 --> 36:29.063
You tell me.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.734
It has something to do
with Christmas?

36:32.859 --> 36:35.612
So you've been dreaming of me
as well.

36:36.404 --> 36:38.156
I've had nightmares.

36:40.116 --> 36:42.619
You used your bridge
to find Sharon Smith.

36:42.744 --> 36:43.995
I'll use it to find Haley.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.664
That's not true.
You'd have done it already.

37:14.150 --> 37:17.654
Your body is already paying a price
for using your Shorter Way.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.657
Most strong creatives are crippled

37:20.782 --> 37:23.368
before they ever reach
their full potential.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.162
But I'm going to live forever.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.915
Because I've figured out
how to refill

37:29.040 --> 37:30.917
what my inscape takes from me.

37:33.461 --> 37:35.380
I could teach you.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.007
Like you taught Bing?

37:38.132 --> 37:40.176
Mr Partridge is a...

37:41.010 --> 37:42.637
simple man.

37:43.888 --> 37:46.766
But my dear,
we are one in a trillion.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.603
We?

37:52.814 --> 37:54.440
Look at those...

37:56.192 --> 37:57.902
...commuters.

37:58.528 --> 38:01.406
Stacked against one another,
you'd be hard pressed to find

38:01.531 --> 38:03.199
any differences between them.

38:04.367 --> 38:07.912
Creative people do not belong
among them.

38:08.538 --> 38:10.081
I doubt you belong anywhere.

38:10.206 --> 38:12.458
A feeling I'm sure you know well.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.636
Christmasland is my life's work.

39:07.722 --> 39:10.141
It is a place of wonder and joy.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.394
Your friend Haley is there,

39:13.519 --> 39:15.897
safe and sound
with all my other children.

39:16.564 --> 39:18.649
I've given them everything.

39:21.944 --> 39:23.696
Except a mother.

39:29.911 --> 39:34.290
You would be very welcome
in Christmasland, Vic McQueen.

39:36.542 --> 39:40.046
Dare I say,
you belong there with me.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.842
I'd rather go swimming
at Amity Island.

39:46.385 --> 39:47.887
It means I'd rather die.

39:49.263 --> 39:51.057
That is an option.

39:51.724 --> 39:53.851
If you refuse my generosity

39:53.976 --> 39:56.604
and cannot be prevailed upon
to behave yourself,

39:56.729 --> 39:59.190
I will be forced to take measures.

40:01.943 --> 40:03.736
Here's what I'm gonna do.

40:04.737 --> 40:07.990
I'm going to take my bridge
to your inscape, rescue Haley,

40:08.116 --> 40:10.660
and burn Christmasland
to the ground with you in it.

40:16.165 --> 40:18.209
You are gifted, my joy.

40:19.544 --> 40:22.505
And have great faith in your bridge.

40:22.630 --> 40:26.717
But no one has ever been able
to enter Christmasland,

40:26.843 --> 40:29.554
except via my Wraith.

40:39.438 --> 40:40.898
I told you to come alone.

40:41.023 --> 40:42.233
I did, asshole.

40:42.358 --> 40:44.277
Who is Margaret Leigh?

41:33.034 --> 41:34.535
Vic!

41:34.660 --> 41:35.828
Vic!

41:38.873 --> 41:40.416
Maggie!

41:40.958 --> 41:43.211
Hey, Maggie, look at me. Hey.

41:43.336 --> 41:45.129
Wake up. Maggie?

41:55.348 --> 41:57.266
Maggie. Hey...

41:59.977 --> 42:02.980
Hey, wake up, wake up.
Hey, look at me.

42:26.796 --> 42:29.757
Sorry to bother you. Do you mind
if we go somewhere and talk?

42:30.341 --> 42:33.803
I'm not going anywhere.
Especially not to talk with you.

42:36.013 --> 42:37.139
Just a few questions...

42:37.265 --> 42:40.434
I answered your questions before
you let Sharon's murderer go free.

42:40.559 --> 42:43.104
I didn't have
enough evidence to hold him.

42:43.604 --> 42:45.523
What you told me wasn't enough.

42:48.109 --> 42:50.027
- Was Bing your boyfriend, Vic?
- What?

42:50.152 --> 42:51.737
- Were you with him?
- No.

42:51.862 --> 42:54.156
Then why leave out so many details?

42:54.865 --> 42:57.034
Were you scared
he was going to hurt you?

42:57.618 --> 43:00.162
So you were at the bus station,
trying to leave town?

43:00.288 --> 43:01.539
Oh, my God...

43:04.333 --> 43:06.669
Who was driving the car
that hit Miss Leigh?

43:07.503 --> 43:10.172
Was it Bing? Did you see him?

43:12.008 --> 43:13.843
You must have seen the driver.

43:16.012 --> 43:18.764
We are never going to find out
who did this to your friend,

43:18.889 --> 43:21.309
we'll never find Haley,
and more people will get hurt

43:21.434 --> 43:23.519
unless you tell me what you know.

43:25.313 --> 43:27.106
Who was driving the car?

43:32.194 --> 43:33.612
No one.

43:38.492 --> 43:41.662
It's a black,
1938 Rolls Royce Wraith,

43:42.580 --> 43:46.083
with a vanity license plate, NOS4A2.

43:47.168 --> 43:49.920
And I watched it
run down Maggie on its own.

43:55.468 --> 43:58.012
You're saying the car hit Maggie
with no driver?

43:59.513 --> 44:02.099
The Wraith belongs to Charlie Manx.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.315
He uses it to hurt people.

44:11.108 --> 44:12.985
He uses it to steal kids,
and take them

44:13.110 --> 44:17.198
to a dark place in his imagination...
called Christmasland,

44:17.323 --> 44:18.991
where he hurts them too.

44:19.992 --> 44:23.454
There's a bridge, the Shorter Way,
that I can build in my mind.

44:24.955 --> 44:27.041
It helps me find lost things.

44:28.292 --> 44:30.920
I thought it could help me
find lost children.

44:44.225 --> 44:46.894
They want me to sign
a conditional voluntary commitment.

44:47.019 --> 44:48.187
I know.

44:50.815 --> 44:51.857
I'm not crazy.

44:52.483 --> 44:54.026
I know you're not.

44:58.197 --> 45:01.242
It's just, you know, a few days.

45:02.743 --> 45:04.286
Just to get some rest, Vic.

45:05.746 --> 45:07.915
Just to get a little help, Brat.

45:08.040 --> 45:11.001
I wish that I had gotten some help
when I needed it.

45:13.421 --> 45:15.172
I don't need help.

45:18.426 --> 45:20.136
This is a good thing.

45:22.304 --> 45:24.515
Good for me,
or good for you and Tiffany?

45:27.935 --> 45:29.520
I guess, good for everyone.
