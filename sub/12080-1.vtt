WEBVTT

01:23.533 --> 01:26.164
You're in my place.

01:32.599 --> 01:34.632
I'm sorry?

01:34.633 --> 01:37.064
You're in my place.

02:58.499 --> 03:00.764
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:39.799 --> 03:41.899
Hey, you!

03:41.900 --> 03:44.532
- Me?
- Visitors have to sign in.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.766
Oh wait, I've worked
here for seven years.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.932
- <i>I see you every day.</i>
- I don't work weekends...

03:48.933 --> 03:51.032
- I'm sorry?
- ...It is therefore impossible

03:51.033 --> 03:52.899
for you to see me every day. I.D.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.365
- Yeah, I...
- <i>Supplementary I.D.</i>

03:56.366 --> 03:57.999
Oh yeah, the funny thing
is I don't have any.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.999
It's actually in my case, which
is in the door of a train.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.932
- It got stuck.
- Do you think that's funny?

04:01.933 --> 04:04.099
No. No, it's actually more
upsetting than anything else.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.798
Don't make a jest of this, sir.

04:07.632 --> 04:08.899
I won't.

04:17.531 --> 04:21.665
Oh, um... Actually my
name is Simon James.

04:21.666 --> 04:25.497
Uh, you left off the
"J" in my last name.

04:31.999 --> 04:34.332
- I need to see your pass.
- Right.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.032
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

04:36.033 --> 04:37.798
Sorry.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.032
<i>Put your jacket on, son.</i>

06:15.033 --> 06:16.966
This isn't a brothel.

06:16.967 --> 06:19.932
No shirking! This is the big push!

06:19.933 --> 06:24.599
Plenty to do. The Colonel is counting
on each and every one of you, as am I.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.332
Mr. Papadopoulos, actually...
Mr. Papadopoulos, excuse me.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.032
Mr. Papadopoulos, I've finished up.

06:29.033 --> 06:31.465
In fact, I completed substantially
more than my quota.

06:31.466 --> 06:33.133
I took my jacket off only
because it's so hot,

06:33.134 --> 06:35.066
not because I mistook the
office for a brothel.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.966
Excellent job. That's the
type of initiative we need.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.632
How long have you been here, son?

06:38.633 --> 06:40.066
- Just started, eh?
- Yes sir, seven years ago.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.999
<i>You know we've been
pruning the dead wood.</i>

06:42.000 --> 06:44.066
The Colonel refuses to
carry any more passengers.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.365
Er, actually, I have some
rather exciting ideas

06:46.366 --> 06:47.899
I've been wanting to share
with the Colonel about how

06:47.900 --> 06:49.532
we could make our
reports more efficient.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.365
I think by using simple
regression analysis

06:51.366 --> 06:53.465
we could really reconfigure
the entire business.

06:53.466 --> 06:55.899
- My daughter's name is Melanie.
- <i>A nice name.</i>

06:55.900 --> 06:58.332
She's interning for the holidays.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.465
- Say hello, Melanie.
- Hello, Melanie.

07:00.466 --> 07:02.599
Stanley here is gonna
be your mentor.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.399
- Yes. What?
- An hour a day,

07:04.400 --> 07:06.099
at your discretion.
She's a good girl,

07:06.100 --> 07:08.665
- but no head for figures.
- Yeah.

07:08.666 --> 07:11.031
Idiot.

07:14.399 --> 07:17.066
- You can go now.
- Right. Yes, thank you.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.832
Because if I were to
find out how depressing

07:18.833 --> 07:20.932
and demeaning whatever the
fuck it is you do here,

07:20.933 --> 07:23.032
I might be forced to
feel sorry for you.

07:23.033 --> 07:26.432
Right. Well,

07:26.433 --> 07:28.099
I look forward to it.

08:37.631 --> 08:39.131
Hi.

08:47.332 --> 08:48.499
Copy.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.165
<i>Oh.</i>

08:52.099 --> 08:54.399
Why don't you print out two copies?
That would make sense.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.999
That would be what a
normal person would do.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.365
- Sorry.
- You can't use this place for one copy.

08:58.366 --> 08:59.966
- It was the same story yesterday.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

08:59.967 --> 09:02.098
- You're always sorry.
- Sorry about that.

09:02.099 --> 09:03.832
Hey, Hannah, can you stay late?

09:03.833 --> 09:06.111
- I've gotta get this thing lanced.
- Uh-huh.

09:07.499 --> 09:09.432
One copy.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.732
Yes, please.

09:33.632 --> 09:35.364
<i>I know.</i>

09:35.899 --> 09:37.098
<i>I know!</i>

09:37.099 --> 09:39.464
<i>Yes, mom, I'll be there.</i>

09:40.532 --> 09:42.465
I always work late.

09:42.466 --> 09:44.432
I'm trying to leave now.

09:44.433 --> 09:46.665
Because I'm talking to you. Yeah.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.766
Okay. Yes. Bye.

09:48.767 --> 09:51.364
You can rely on me. Okay.

10:36.465 --> 10:38.065
<i>People...</i>

10:38.066 --> 10:39.866
<i>The ultimate resource.</i>

10:39.867 --> 10:42.732
<i>Yet to some businesses
they all look the same.</i>

10:42.733 --> 10:45.732
<i>But the Colonel knows
people are different.</i>

10:45.733 --> 10:49.432
<i>The Colonel knows business is
people and people are business,</i>

10:49.433 --> 10:52.864
<i>making your business his business.</i>

10:55.632 --> 10:58.332
<i>Because the Colonel knows people.</i>

10:58.333 --> 11:00.832
<i>And the Colonel knows
that you demand</i>

11:00.833 --> 11:03.532
<i>the most powerful
data-processing system</i>

11:03.533 --> 11:06.364
<i>on the planet to make
sense of it all.</i>

11:07.532 --> 11:09.599
<i>The Colonel will show you people</i>

11:09.600 --> 11:12.464
<i>in a way your business
can understand.</i>

11:13.332 --> 11:15.766
<i>Because the Colonel knows
there's no such thing</i>

11:15.767 --> 11:16.866
<i>as special people.</i>

11:16.867 --> 11:18.732
Just people.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.665
- Which one was you?
- Which one...

11:24.666 --> 11:26.365
I don't know how to answer that.

11:26.366 --> 11:27.766
The one... the one that was me.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.665
He didn't look like you.
He had brown hair.

11:29.666 --> 11:31.332
We both have brown hair.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.799
I mean, I have... I...
We're the same person.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.565
- I'm not gonna die ever...
- I know.

11:35.566 --> 11:37.098
- ...so you can forget it.
- Okay.

11:37.099 --> 11:38.931
Will you stop talking?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.898
I'm trying to sleep.

11:40.899 --> 11:44.532
Your mother says
you're a strange boy.

11:44.533 --> 11:47.998
- <i>I'm sorry?</i>
- Your mother says you're a strange boy.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.430
Oh. Thank you.

11:51.766 --> 11:53.799
Let me see your hand.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.197
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine.

11:56.998 --> 11:59.197
You're not right.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.497
May I speak with you?

12:03.031 --> 12:05.097
Yes.

12:05.632 --> 12:06.998
Will you excuse me?

12:06.999 --> 12:09.499
Yes?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.365
There seems to be a
discrepancy in your bill.

12:12.366 --> 12:16.632
Oh yes, well, there was a
rather large cost increase

12:16.633 --> 12:18.832
- and no explanation, so I thought...
- There's a new price.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.798
- And why is that?
- Improvements.

12:22.632 --> 12:24.799
- That seems a little...
- <i>Unfair.</i>

12:24.800 --> 12:26.330
Yeah.

12:29.766 --> 12:31.732
Oh, sorry.

12:35.599 --> 12:37.565
Okay.

12:58.699 --> 13:00.332
That's all I have.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.531
Yeah.

13:03.065 --> 13:05.164
It's not enough.

16:41.898 --> 16:43.865
You shouldn't be doing that.

16:43.866 --> 16:45.930
Sorry.

18:32.731 --> 18:35.332
- And then what did you do?
- Sorry?

18:35.333 --> 18:37.531
And then what did you do?

18:37.532 --> 18:39.098
- I called the police.
- Right.

18:39.099 --> 18:40.698
Anything else?

18:40.699 --> 18:42.365
He waved at me.

18:42.366 --> 18:44.531
- Yeah?
- Right before he jumped he waved.

18:44.532 --> 18:46.063
How did he wave?

18:47.698 --> 18:50.098
- Did you wave back?
- I wonder why he did it.

18:50.099 --> 18:52.531
His note said he was lonely.
He should have got a dog.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.098
Or exercised more.
That's important.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.798
- Should I write that down?
- Maybe in parenthesis.

18:55.799 --> 18:57.698
- Does that mean brackets?
- What the fuck are brackets?

18:57.699 --> 19:00.098
- Did he suffer?
- Splat.

19:00.099 --> 19:02.931
Do you see this sort
of thing often?

19:02.932 --> 19:05.698
Every day. That's what
we do... suicides.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.865
- Only suicides?
- That's right.

19:07.866 --> 19:11.065
- For the whole city?
- We can barely cover the neighborhood.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.898
You know the funny thing is

19:12.899 --> 19:16.898
he would have landed on that awning if
he'd just jumped a few feet to the right.

19:16.899 --> 19:20.631
You see that? He would
have fallen, bounced off

19:20.632 --> 19:23.365
and landed somewhere about there.

19:23.366 --> 19:25.031
Probably would have survived.

19:25.032 --> 19:27.765
Horribly maimed,
of course, but still.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.698
If you get 'em to the hospital quick
enough to stop the brain swelling.

19:30.699 --> 19:32.429
You're not thinking of
killing yourself, are you?

19:32.430 --> 19:32.831
Sorry?

19:32.832 --> 19:34.664
- It's a simple question.
- No.

19:34.665 --> 19:38.563
- Should I put him down as a "no"?
- Put him down as a "maybe."

19:59.031 --> 20:01.398
What are you doing here?

20:01.399 --> 20:03.931
The man that jumped?

20:03.932 --> 20:05.631
- I saw it.
- How?

20:05.632 --> 20:07.564
I live in that building.

20:07.565 --> 20:08.865
I didn't know him.

20:08.866 --> 20:11.897
- He waved at me.
- Strange.

20:14.398 --> 20:16.031
It's the Colonel's ball tomorrow.

20:16.032 --> 20:17.898
Do you think you'll go?
I don't know if I'll go.

20:17.899 --> 20:19.863
It's mandatory. Everyone has to go.

20:20.398 --> 20:21.931
Hannah?

20:21.932 --> 20:23.332
Yeah?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.897
It's terrible to be alone too much.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.397
I think it was an orange
juice. I just...

20:36.564 --> 20:38.598
- Are they normally that rude here?
- Yes.

20:38.599 --> 20:41.564
- Then why do you come?
- I think I'm quite loyal.

20:43.966 --> 20:47.631
You'll have to hand in your
holo-badge and blaster.

20:47.632 --> 20:49.430
Come and get 'em.

20:53.731 --> 20:56.797
Holster your blaster, Jack.

20:58.831 --> 21:00.863
I like this show.

21:01.965 --> 21:03.698
<i>I don't mind dying.</i>

21:03.699 --> 21:05.531
<i>In fact, I'm getting
quite used to it.</i>

21:05.532 --> 21:08.398
<i>The way I figure it,
you only get one life.</i>

21:08.399 --> 21:11.098
<i>And like they say...</i>

21:11.099 --> 21:13.865
<i>There's no such thing
as second chances.</i>

21:13.866 --> 21:16.797
<i>Jack, this isn't you.</i>

21:18.898 --> 21:20.831
<i>Then who the hell is?</i>

21:20.832 --> 21:22.464
<i>He's in your heart.</i>

21:22.465 --> 21:25.230
<i>He's good and right and true.</i>

21:26.331 --> 21:28.664
I was lying when I said
I didn't know him.

21:28.665 --> 21:31.863
The man who jumped?
I kind of knew him.

21:32.898 --> 21:35.331
I'd never really met him.
I'd more confronted him.

21:35.332 --> 21:37.898
He was this person who'd been
following me around for a while,

21:37.899 --> 21:39.731
and I'd always see him,
no matter where I went...

21:39.732 --> 21:42.931
Like at the office, on the
subway, by my apartment.

21:42.932 --> 21:44.931
You know, in that little underpass
thing by the apartments?

21:44.932 --> 21:47.031
He'd just be there, watching.

21:47.032 --> 21:49.731
And I thought, "that's strange."
But, you know, whatever.

21:49.732 --> 21:51.098
Men look at women.
You get used to it.

21:51.099 --> 21:56.364
But then I found out that he lived above
me and I thought, "that's really odd."

21:56.365 --> 21:58.865
Like, did he follow me around because
he lived in the same building as me

21:58.866 --> 22:01.765
<i>and he got fixated? Or did he
get fixated and then move in?</i>

22:01.766 --> 22:04.364
<i>So anyway, eventually I
thought, "you know what?</i>

22:04.365 --> 22:06.531
Enough is enough." Because it was
actually getting frightening.

22:06.532 --> 22:09.898
Well, like a little bit frightening. It
was more annoying than frightening, so...

22:09.899 --> 22:12.564
I went up to him and he looked
over his shoulder at me

22:12.565 --> 22:15.098
as if to say, "who, me?"
Like he hadn't been stalking me.

22:15.099 --> 22:18.431
And so I looked at him square in the eyes
and I said, "what do you want from me?"

22:18.432 --> 22:20.831
<i>And he starts stumbling and mumbling</i>

22:20.832 --> 22:22.998
<i>and says, "I think I'm
falling for you."</i>

22:22.999 --> 22:25.098
<i>And I said, "do you think
just staring at me</i>

22:25.099 --> 22:26.931
<i>is some kind of meaningful gesture?</i>

22:26.932 --> 22:29.564
What exactly do you think
is going to happen here?

22:29.565 --> 22:30.931
Do you think you know who I am?

22:30.932 --> 22:32.831
You know, that if you
stare long enough,

22:32.832 --> 22:34.931
I'll just turn around one
day and I'll kiss you?

22:34.932 --> 22:36.831
Like we're going to
somehow be together?

22:36.832 --> 22:39.897
Stop fucking following me!"

22:45.498 --> 22:47.364
And he did.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.664
- <i>My God, when was this?</i>
- Last night.

22:49.665 --> 22:52.496
Do you think there's a connection?

22:54.065 --> 22:57.065
No. I mean, it sounds like he
had a lot of things going on.

22:57.066 --> 22:59.331
I mean, maybe he just wanted
somebody to notice him.

22:59.332 --> 23:02.050
You know, a person can get
really sick of just floating by.

23:03.065 --> 23:05.765
But I attract so many weirdos.

23:05.766 --> 23:08.098
<i>Anyway what's your story?</i>

23:08.099 --> 23:11.364
- <i>When did you move into the building?</i>
- A long time ago.

23:11.365 --> 23:13.865
Yeah, I definitely
didn't move in recently.

23:13.866 --> 23:15.698
Thanks for this.

23:15.699 --> 23:18.296
I feel better.

23:20.731 --> 23:22.765
Hey, I just got my ears pierced.

23:22.766 --> 23:25.498
That's weird, huh, at my age?

23:25.499 --> 23:28.798
No. I mean, you're not that old or weird.
You're just...

23:28.799 --> 23:31.431
- Hey, you got a call.
- Oh, it's not for me.

23:31.432 --> 23:33.031
Frumpy-looking guy named Simon?

23:33.032 --> 23:35.531
That's me. Yeah.

23:35.532 --> 23:37.731
Would you excuse me? Mom?

23:37.732 --> 23:40.396
No, it's just a night terror.

23:41.331 --> 23:43.830
No, that didn't ever happen.

23:44.598 --> 23:46.765
I know I'm a disappointment.

23:46.766 --> 23:49.997
I have to go now. I'm with a girl.

23:50.698 --> 23:52.765
Yes, a female girl.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.830
I don't know if she's fertile.

24:06.898 --> 24:10.098
"Thanks for the talk. Maybe
see you at the ball.

24:10.099 --> 24:12.431
Here, play a song for me. Hannah."

25:26.499 --> 25:28.431
No, nothing, you're not here.

25:28.432 --> 25:29.965
My card hasn't been working.

25:29.966 --> 25:31.965
Why does no one else
have to swipe in?

25:31.966 --> 25:34.498
- See you in there!
- Harris. Wait, Harris, he knows...

25:34.499 --> 25:36.664
Harris, could you please
tell her who I am?

25:36.665 --> 25:38.898
- I've never seen this man before in my life.
- <i>You're not here.</i>

25:38.899 --> 25:40.831
- I've worked here for seven years.
- You're just not here.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.765
Why would I try to break into
something that's mandatory?

25:42.766 --> 25:44.998
- Planning on breaking in?
- You know what "mandatory" means?

25:44.999 --> 25:47.064
- 'Cause that's not allowed.
- It means that no one wants to be here.

25:47.065 --> 25:49.229
You don't know what I want.

26:08.598 --> 26:11.097
<i>♪ I was born</i>

26:11.098 --> 26:15.097
<i>♪ In east Virginia</i>

26:15.998 --> 26:19.531

26:19.532 --> 26:22.329

27:07.831 --> 27:09.030
You're not meant to be here.

27:09.031 --> 27:10.631
I have worked here for seven years.

27:10.632 --> 27:12.064
I am an employee of this company.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.865
You'd be well-advised
to let go of me.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.463
Do not test my strength.

27:37.564 --> 27:39.364
<i>♪ Still in the night...</i>

27:39.365 --> 27:42.898
<i>♪ I'm dreaming about you...</i>

27:42.899 --> 27:45.064
Sir, this is not me.

27:45.065 --> 27:48.296
<i>This is not me.</i>

27:49.431 --> 27:52.163
No. This is not me, sir!

27:52.964 --> 27:56.464
<i>♪ Just the thought</i>

27:56.465 --> 28:00.564

28:03.532 --> 28:07.463

30:41.930 --> 30:44.564
I bought you a present, but I
decided it wasn't appropriate.

30:44.565 --> 30:46.062
Hmm?

30:50.498 --> 30:55.030
I bought you a present, but I
decided it wasn't appropriate.

30:55.031 --> 30:57.163
Oh.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.263
Okay.

31:20.664 --> 31:22.498
I really didn't kick it that hard.

31:22.499 --> 31:25.329
The hardness of the
kick was recorded.

31:27.797 --> 31:29.488
- Super.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

31:29.489 --> 31:32.564
- I've never done anything like that before.
- If I could just trouble you for your card?

31:32.565 --> 31:35.896
- Yeah.
- Magic.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.664
I'm afraid this card is corrupted.

31:41.665 --> 31:43.598
Corrupted? What does
that mean, "corrupted"?

31:43.599 --> 31:45.764
You will receive a replacement
within six to eight weeks.

31:45.765 --> 31:47.730
Well, how will I get in
and out of the building?

31:47.731 --> 31:49.329
Lovely.

31:50.930 --> 31:51.861
This one?

31:51.862 --> 31:53.509
Er, no, that one. And
it's worth checking

31:53.510 --> 31:55.697
- after a couple of screen pages.
- How do you not kill yourself?

31:55.698 --> 31:59.431
Jesus, that was brutal last night.
So embarrassing getting chucked out.

31:59.432 --> 32:02.598
- Hannah saw the whole thing, of course.
- Oh, yeah, you got it. That's it.

32:02.599 --> 32:05.365
Do you think you're being encouraging?
Is that why you keep saying things?

32:05.366 --> 32:07.864
Maybe you should get your printer
fixed is what I'm saying.

32:07.865 --> 32:09.897
- Are you touching my earlobe?
- Yes, I am.

32:09.898 --> 32:11.331
Aren't you like a
million years old?

32:11.332 --> 32:13.531
- Don't fight this.
- Harris, that's not appropriate.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.030
Why won't you die?

32:15.031 --> 32:18.864
<i>We could really use</i>
a bright young man like you.

32:18.865 --> 32:22.062
Especially right now, with
the big push and all.

32:23.764 --> 32:26.531
<i>I'd like to introduce everyone
to our newest co-worker.</i>

32:26.532 --> 32:28.964
<i>A bright young man who I'm
sure will be an asset.</i>

32:28.965 --> 32:32.598
<i>He was the only one not fired in
the final cull at our sister office.</i>

32:32.599 --> 32:34.897
<i>Even the cockroaches
didn't survive.</i>

32:34.898 --> 32:37.697
<i>Well, I'll let you get
started, young hotshot.</i>

32:37.698 --> 32:40.563
<i>Soon you'll have my job.</i>

32:41.331 --> 32:45.363
<i>Everyone, please
welcome James Simon.</i>

32:50.531 --> 32:53.730
There's no need to be alarmed.
My cleaning lady's a diabetic.

32:53.731 --> 32:55.030
We just need to jam a
cookie down his throat.

32:55.031 --> 32:56.697
No, no, sir, I'm not diabetic.

32:56.698 --> 32:58.697
- It's just a shock that...
- Don't worry, son.

32:58.698 --> 33:01.697
We're not replacing you. I'm not one
of these holier-than-thou types.

33:01.698 --> 33:04.697
Drugs can be healthy for a person.
<i>Just leave it out of the office.</i>

33:04.698 --> 33:05.997
No, no, not drugs, sir. No, no.

33:05.998 --> 33:07.797
Last night was a
mistake. And now...

33:07.798 --> 33:09.598
Now... now this strange
man, I just...

33:09.599 --> 33:11.730
No need for details.
It's happened to us all.

33:11.731 --> 33:14.329
Have a drink of water
then get back to work.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.531
Harris.

34:02.532 --> 34:04.930
Harris, have you spoken
to the new employee?

34:04.931 --> 34:07.331
- James? Yeah sure, I met him.
- And?

34:07.332 --> 34:08.697
He seems all right.

34:08.697 --> 34:10.730
But did you notice anything
strange about him?

34:10.731 --> 34:12.830
- I mean, did he remind you of anyone?
- No.

34:12.831 --> 34:14.730
- No one at the office?
- No.

34:14.731 --> 34:16.929
Okay. Would...

34:16.931 --> 34:18.697
Can I... could you...

34:18.697 --> 34:20.431
Would... could I please just...

34:20.431 --> 34:22.797
<i>You can...</i>

34:22.797 --> 34:25.096
Thank you.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.362
Yeah.

34:51.663 --> 34:55.795
- Who did you have in mind?
- Me, for instance.

34:56.663 --> 34:58.431
Oh yeah, suppose so.

34:58.432 --> 35:00.331
You suppose so?

35:00.332 --> 35:02.431
<i>Yeah yeah, you look just like him.</i>

35:02.432 --> 35:04.830
- Yes, I do, don't I?
- Yeah, and you're not even Chinese.

35:04.831 --> 35:06.697
- It's pretty fucked up.
- Yes, it is that.

35:06.698 --> 35:08.030
Now now why didn't you notice?

35:08.031 --> 35:09.864
Well, no offense, mate, but...

35:09.865 --> 35:11.997
You're pretty unnoticeable.

35:11.998 --> 35:14.896
Bit of a non-person.

36:53.097 --> 36:54.764
What'll it be?

36:54.765 --> 36:56.797
What, do you want to go...?
Okay, no, sorry then.

36:56.798 --> 37:00.064
I'll just have a...
Coke and a bagel.

37:00.065 --> 37:01.663
- We're out of bagels.
- Oh.

37:01.664 --> 37:03.830
Right, then, um...

37:03.831 --> 37:06.530
Right. Then I'll just...

37:06.531 --> 37:09.229
- Come on.
- Right, sorry, I just...

37:10.764 --> 37:14.331
I'll just... I can just have
the coke then, I guess.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.097
- A coke. And you?
- A coffee.

37:16.098 --> 37:17.797
- A coffee.
- And scrambled eggs.

37:17.798 --> 37:19.630
<i>We don't serve breakfast
in the evening.</i>

37:19.631 --> 37:22.097
- Why not?
- Because it says so on the menu.

37:22.098 --> 37:23.897
- Well, do you still have eggs here?
- Yeah.

37:23.898 --> 37:25.530
- And do you have a frying pan?
- Yeah.

37:25.531 --> 37:27.797
Then do me a favor and make
me some scrambled eggs.

37:27.798 --> 37:29.864
- Fine. Anything else?
- Bacon.

37:29.865 --> 37:31.497
- Bacon.
- And toast.

37:31.498 --> 37:33.064
- And toast.
- And a beer.

37:33.065 --> 37:34.764
And a beer. Anything else?

37:34.765 --> 37:36.030
- No, that's it.
- Are you sure?

37:36.031 --> 37:37.930
Just get me the damn food.

37:39.865 --> 37:42.030
- What? I'm hungry.
- No, it's just...

37:42.031 --> 37:44.463
I don't know, I would
have never done that.

37:44.464 --> 37:46.430
- You don't like eggs?
- No, I mean, I just...

37:46.431 --> 37:48.697
Don't think I would feel comfortable
talking to someone like that.

37:48.698 --> 37:50.730
She's a waitress. She's
here to serve us.

37:50.731 --> 37:53.030
If you don't tell her what you
actually want, how can she do her job?

37:53.031 --> 37:55.764
No, I can see that... She can
be a little short sometimes,

37:55.765 --> 37:58.330
and I do think being forthright
certainly has its place.

37:58.331 --> 38:00.697
And I'm not, like, criticizing
your behavior or anything.

38:00.698 --> 38:02.530
Here is your coffee,

38:02.531 --> 38:06.930
your beer and your breakfast.

38:06.931 --> 38:08.663
We're out of coke.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.097
You both have very beautiful hands.

38:22.098 --> 38:24.096
To be continued.

38:25.330 --> 38:27.363
Don't go anywhere.

38:27.364 --> 38:29.663
The dark-haired one is a dirty dirty
thing. Which one do you want?

38:29.664 --> 38:32.430
- I'm sorry?
- I prefer the brunette, but either way.

38:32.431 --> 38:34.430
That's all right,
you can have both.

38:34.431 --> 38:37.163
- Never again.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

38:38.630 --> 38:40.530
- Hey, watch it, will you?
- Sorry, sorry.

38:40.531 --> 38:42.330
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

38:42.331 --> 38:43.697
Hi, I don't think we've talked.

38:43.698 --> 38:45.976
Would you mind holding
this for me? Thank you.

38:47.864 --> 38:49.630
We should leave.

39:21.597 --> 39:23.862
How come you don't
have a girlfriend?

39:24.397 --> 39:26.296
I don't know.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.397
<i>You a flamer?</i>

39:29.398 --> 39:32.330
No, there's someone I've
been thinking about.

39:32.331 --> 39:33.730
A lot.

39:33.731 --> 39:36.097
- Like some fantasy shit?
- No, she's real.

39:36.098 --> 39:37.864
A person.

39:37.865 --> 39:40.929
- So what's the problem?
- I don't know.

39:43.363 --> 39:46.395
I have all these things that I
want to say to her, like...

39:47.597 --> 39:52.463
Like how I can tell that she's a lonely
person, even if other people can't.

39:52.464 --> 39:55.463
'Cause... 'Cause I know
what it feels like

39:55.464 --> 39:59.096
<i>to be lost and lonely
and invisible.</i>

40:00.363 --> 40:03.864
Simon, you have to go
after what you want.

40:03.865 --> 40:07.630
I would tear the asshole off an elephant
for a piece of trim I wanted that bad.

40:07.631 --> 40:11.295
<i>I've tried talking to her, but
I don't know how to be myself.</i>

40:12.463 --> 40:16.328
It's like I'm permanently
outside myself.

40:18.463 --> 40:24.263
Like... like you could push your hand
straight through me if you wanted to.

40:25.563 --> 40:28.530
And I couldn't see the type
of man that I wanna be

40:28.531 --> 40:30.430
versus the type of
man I actually am.

40:30.431 --> 40:35.796
And I know that I'm doing it, but I'm
incapable of doing what needs to be done.

40:36.330 --> 40:38.462
I'm like Pinocchio.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.630
I'm a wooden boy,

40:41.631 --> 40:44.229
not a real boy.

40:45.430 --> 40:47.896
And it kills me.

43:17.063 --> 43:19.430
<i>Hey, it's okay. He's with me.</i>

43:19.431 --> 43:20.897
Oh. Please.

43:20.898 --> 43:23.395
Any friend of James's
is a friend of mine.

43:28.330 --> 43:30.063
I'm not even making
that up, really.

43:30.064 --> 43:32.663
Oh, Harris, did you get a chance
to take a look at that report yet?

43:32.664 --> 43:34.597
Ah, good, thank you. No, not now.

43:34.598 --> 43:37.029
And, uh, Rudolph,
no rush on the coffee.

43:37.030 --> 43:39.929
I'll take a nap or something.

44:02.563 --> 44:04.830
- What switch?
- What switch?

44:04.831 --> 44:06.897
The switch. You're taking
the aptitude test for me.

44:06.898 --> 44:08.864
We-we went through all this
last night, the switch.

44:08.865 --> 44:10.530
- Please stop saying "the switch."
- You said you would help me

44:10.531 --> 44:11.996
with all this boring office-work
crap like this test.

44:11.997 --> 44:15.096
I've got reports to finish. I am out
of my booth. I have to teach Melanie.

44:15.097 --> 44:17.063
Just take the test.
I'll babysit for an hour.

44:17.064 --> 44:19.830
- Do you even know what we do here?
- What's to know?

44:21.398 --> 44:22.963
What if we get caught?

44:22.964 --> 44:26.295
Well, how will we get caught?
We have the same face.

44:27.397 --> 44:29.864
You may now turn over your paper.

44:29.865 --> 44:32.397
<i>Look at the two screens</i>

44:32.398 --> 44:35.562
<i>and identify the next
figure in the sequence.</i>

44:40.530 --> 44:42.463
All the boys in my school are
so childish, so immature.

44:42.464 --> 44:44.463
No, nothing but a batch
of raging hormones.

44:44.464 --> 44:46.029
It's like daddy wanted me to go
on a date with his friend's son.

44:46.030 --> 44:47.730
Like just 'cause we're the
same age doesn't mean

44:47.731 --> 44:49.430
- <i>we have anything in common.</i>
- Mm-hmm, no.

44:49.431 --> 44:52.896
It's no substitute for a real spiritual
connection or... or finding your soul mate.

44:54.063 --> 44:56.130
I don't know, I've always
felt that emotional maturity

44:56.131 --> 45:00.463
is totally unrelated to material age.
I'm just interested in the real person.

45:00.464 --> 45:03.430
- Do you drink coffee?
- No.

45:03.431 --> 45:05.128
Would you like to try one?

45:06.530 --> 45:09.562
- Finished already?
- Yes, sorry.

45:10.430 --> 45:12.430
When do you think you'll
have the results?

45:12.431 --> 45:15.896
For you, right away.

45:20.730 --> 45:23.530
But you need to realize
that data entry

45:23.531 --> 45:26.697
and collection and
computers and stuff,

45:26.698 --> 45:29.830
it can be sensual. It
does have a romance.

45:29.831 --> 45:32.463
It can be sexy. All these
lives that we're recording,

45:32.464 --> 45:34.797
their hopes, their
dreams, their loves...

45:34.798 --> 45:38.497
Each person out there,
apart yet connected.

45:38.498 --> 45:42.162
We're giving these faceless
people immortality.

45:42.996 --> 45:44.597
Wow.

45:44.598 --> 45:46.995
That's an amazing way
of looking at it.

45:50.698 --> 45:53.330
These results are off
the charts, James.

45:53.331 --> 45:55.463
I knew we hired the right
man, I just knew it.

45:55.464 --> 45:56.896
Thank you, sir.

45:56.897 --> 45:59.096
Where is the kid from that desk?

45:59.097 --> 46:01.463
He's been here a while;
Just between you and me,

46:01.464 --> 46:04.497
- he hasn't impressed.
- I'm sure there must be some explanation.

46:04.498 --> 46:07.397
Sticking up for a co-worker even
though he has limited ability...

46:07.398 --> 46:09.829
I like that. Very admirable.

46:11.697 --> 46:13.497
- So?
- Where were you?

46:13.498 --> 46:15.630
<i>- How did I do?</i>
- You aced it.

46:15.631 --> 46:18.764
- Oh! I knew it.
- I told you to be back an hour ago.

46:18.765 --> 46:20.463
<i>Oh, don't worry about it,
the old man's an idiot.</i>

46:20.464 --> 46:21.829
<i>We are gonna be running this place.</i>

46:21.830 --> 46:25.061
All right, so I will leave you to
finish up and get out of your hair.

46:26.630 --> 46:28.730
Where is she? There she is!

46:28.731 --> 46:32.762
Oh, you got me. You got me.

46:35.063 --> 46:38.463
And it's a good thing I fixed my printer.
Just used a little elbow grease,

46:38.464 --> 46:40.430
so I won't be needing
to come down as much.

46:40.431 --> 46:42.463
When you rub them together
they usually sound like crickets,

46:42.464 --> 46:44.397
- but... I've lost it.
- And I'm sorry

46:44.398 --> 46:46.430
I missed you at the Colonel's
ball the other night.

46:46.431 --> 46:48.597
- I think they've changed the cups.
- Well, back to work.

46:48.598 --> 46:51.497
Hmm. Strange.

46:51.498 --> 46:54.029
- Hey, that went great!
- I don't know.

46:54.030 --> 46:57.563
Leave her wanting more. Did you use the
line about the elbow grease? That's erotic.

46:57.564 --> 46:59.397
<i>Okay, within a week you're
going to get hand on boob.</i>

46:59.398 --> 47:02.363
That is a promise. Now we stick
to the plan, okay? No contact.

47:02.364 --> 47:04.462
Cold Turkey for a
few days. All right?

47:12.096 --> 47:13.963
Yeah yeah, she's
definitely looking at you.

47:13.964 --> 47:16.330
You had a little setback at
the ball, but now she's going

47:16.331 --> 47:18.497
"how come Simon hasn't been down to
see me? Why is he being all mysterious?

47:18.498 --> 47:20.430
What's going on in that
magnificent mind of his?"

47:20.431 --> 47:22.096
- Do you really think she's looking at me?
- Yeah.

47:22.097 --> 47:23.630
- All right, now lick your lips.
- Yeah. What?

47:23.631 --> 47:24.863
It sends out a subliminal
sexual signal.

47:24.864 --> 47:27.730
Show the tongue, but be careful
not to look like a lizard. Go.

47:27.731 --> 47:29.562
<i>Yeah, now.</i>

47:30.430 --> 47:32.529
- I feel so stupid.
- Here we go.

47:33.363 --> 47:35.428
Oh... oh.

47:38.430 --> 47:39.729
Is that okay if I stand here?

47:39.730 --> 47:41.395
- Yes, it is.
- Hmm.

47:43.663 --> 47:46.395
So I was thinking maybe we
should meet up sometime.

47:47.963 --> 47:49.996
Just you and me.

48:09.063 --> 48:11.029
<i>This is obviously making
you uncomfortable.</i>

48:11.030 --> 48:12.996
- <i>I was wondering if he mentioned me.</i>
- No, it isn't.

48:12.997 --> 48:15.063
- When you say you've never
met anyone like James...
- Yes.

48:15.064 --> 48:17.430
- I've never met anyone like James.
- I find that hard to process.

48:17.431 --> 48:18.963
- <i>What's hard to process about it?</i>
- What is so unique about him?

48:18.964 --> 48:20.995
- I don't know.
- Try to think.

48:22.363 --> 48:24.063
- He has something.
- Yes, okay, but you've

48:24.064 --> 48:25.963
never even spoken to him, so how
can you know if he has something?

48:25.964 --> 48:27.896
I think you can tell
by looking at someone.

48:27.897 --> 48:30.397
- By looking at someone? I don't under...
- <i>Yes, fuck!</i>

48:30.398 --> 48:32.696
- <i>I'll tell him myself.</i>
- Let's not do that. That won't work.

48:32.697 --> 48:34.796
- <i>I'm putting myself on
the line, I'm vulnerable...</i>
- I understand that.

48:34.797 --> 48:36.430
- I thought you might wanna help.
- <i>I didn't mean to impose.</i>

48:36.431 --> 48:38.063
No knife to your throat
so don't worry about it.

48:38.064 --> 48:39.463
- No, no, I wanna tell him. Please let me.
- Really?

48:39.464 --> 48:40.563
- Yes, I will tell him.
- Are you sure?

48:40.564 --> 48:41.829
<i>- Yes.
- My God, thank you.</i>

48:41.830 --> 48:43.430
- Thank you.
- That's great, thank you.

48:43.431 --> 48:46.463
- Okay.
- Um, thanks, er...

48:46.464 --> 48:48.863
- Simon.
- ...Simon. I'm sorry.

48:48.864 --> 48:51.330
I'm just flustered, but
that's great, thank you.

48:51.331 --> 48:53.397
- Are your hands normally this warm?
- Quite often.

48:53.398 --> 48:56.096
Hmm. And when did you
think our food will arrive?

48:56.097 --> 48:57.696
It normally takes awhile.

48:57.697 --> 49:00.996
<i>I can't say I'm surprised,</i>
but I think this is a good thing.

49:00.997 --> 49:02.863
We'll make a date and
you can go as me.

49:02.864 --> 49:04.630
- I'll give you more coaching.
- Do you think that's ethical?

49:04.631 --> 49:07.696
Er, don't take this the wrong way, but
I think it's unlikely you'll be able

49:07.697 --> 49:09.530
to get into an unethical
situation on a first date.

49:09.531 --> 49:11.729
"Unethical," that's very sweet.

49:11.730 --> 49:13.662
<i>When you're walking with a
woman or standing next to one,</i>

49:13.663 --> 49:15.662
<i>you wanna put your hand on their
lower back, not the ass...</i>

49:15.663 --> 49:18.063
They sometimes get upset
about that... but just above it.

49:18.064 --> 49:20.430
It shows you're interested, but you can
push them down the stairs at any moment.

49:20.431 --> 49:22.063
- Why?
- Because you've got leverage.

49:22.064 --> 49:23.896
- So wait, here? What?
- Stop that. That's gay.

49:23.897 --> 49:25.330
- But you just did it to me.
- Yes, but it was me.

49:25.331 --> 49:26.863
- Do you see the difference?
- Oh.

49:26.864 --> 49:28.330
You can't be doing anything gay.
No ice-cream cones.

49:28.331 --> 49:29.696
- I like ice cream.
- Of course. It's delicious.

49:29.697 --> 49:31.662
Ice cream is fine in a
cup, but in a cone is gay

49:31.663 --> 49:33.530
- unless you're with a woman at the time.
- Anything else?

49:33.531 --> 49:34.929
No riding on a motorcycle
with another man.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.597
Exceptions are drive-by
shootings, bomb throwings

49:36.598 --> 49:38.497
and purse snatchings.
Anything else is gay.

49:38.498 --> 49:40.330
- You seem to know a lot about this.
- Defense wins championships.

49:40.331 --> 49:41.929
You need to tell them how
great you are all the time,

49:41.930 --> 49:44.030
- which means make things up.
- What if they find out?

49:44.031 --> 49:46.530
Make it hard to research, like you
were the captain of a Jai-Alai team

49:46.531 --> 49:47.963
or a brigadier general in the
Navy. Something like that.

49:47.964 --> 49:49.597
I don't think anybody
would believe that.

49:49.598 --> 49:51.029
Then change the subject
and deny everything.

49:51.030 --> 49:54.895
- I just don't know if that's me.
- That's why it's so good.

50:30.929 --> 50:33.795
<i>Just say something.</i>

50:34.629 --> 50:36.562
I used to be an olympic swimmer.

50:36.563 --> 50:38.463
<i>Go to the bathroom now.</i>

50:38.464 --> 50:40.795
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

50:44.096 --> 50:46.063
- What the fuck?
- <i>I can't do this</i>

50:46.064 --> 50:47.729
with you shouting in
my ear like that.

50:47.730 --> 50:49.662
This would be fine if
you'd do what I tell you.

50:49.663 --> 50:52.397
Like jam my knee between her thighs?
I can't do things like that.

50:52.398 --> 50:54.363
I know, that's why
you're gonna die alone.

50:54.364 --> 50:58.063
Sorry, that was cruel. I'm just...
I'm just so frustrated for you.

50:58.064 --> 51:01.262
Look, just give me your jacket.
I'll patch things up, okay?

51:02.763 --> 51:03.963
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Don't be sorry.</i>

51:03.964 --> 51:05.662
No, I am. I've screwed this up.

51:05.663 --> 51:07.430
You can't help it. You're
just not good at this.

51:07.431 --> 51:09.908
- I know.
- <i>I know you know. Give me your jacket.</i>

51:10.096 --> 51:12.529
Wait, did you move tables?

51:12.530 --> 51:14.029
No.

51:16.464 --> 51:19.397
- <i>Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm leaving, is that okay?</i>

51:19.398 --> 51:22.395
No, why?

51:25.964 --> 51:30.128
<i>♪ ...blue blue, blue chateau... ♪</i>

51:35.996 --> 51:39.096
just put it back on the
hanger, thank you.

51:41.663 --> 51:44.029
<i>♪ ...blue blue, blue chateau... ♪</i>

52:19.562 --> 52:22.863
<i>♪ ...blue blue, blue chateau ♪</i>

52:22.864 --> 52:27.896
<i>♪ Blue, blue, blue,
blue, blue, blue ♪</i>

52:27.897 --> 52:32.928
<i>♪ Chateau...</i>

53:04.029 --> 53:05.696
Excuse me.

53:05.697 --> 53:07.763
Did you see a man
who looks exactly like me

53:07.764 --> 53:10.462
- walk in here with a woman?
- This boy's not serious.

53:10.463 --> 53:12.729
- <i>Visitors have to sign in.</i>
- I'm not a visitor.

53:20.462 --> 53:23.763
<i>No, I have to go.
No, I really have to go.</i>

53:23.764 --> 53:25.629
Okay, but I have to go.

53:25.630 --> 53:27.696
Yeah, I have to go.

53:27.697 --> 53:29.696
No, it isn't, I need
to go. It's fine.

53:29.697 --> 53:31.662
I'm at work.

53:31.663 --> 53:34.428
Okay.

53:35.429 --> 53:40.496
Hi. Uh, I know the policy, but my
printer is actually broken again, so.

53:40.497 --> 53:43.330
- How's your growth?
- Hannah, the creepy guy's here again.

53:43.331 --> 53:44.830
Yeah.

53:45.630 --> 53:47.829
- Hi, creepy guy.
- <i>Hey, Hannah.</i>

53:47.830 --> 53:49.896
I was just telling your colleague
that I know the policy,

53:49.897 --> 53:51.729
but my printer is
actually broken again.

53:51.730 --> 53:53.662
- Oh, I thought you fixed it with elbow grease.
- Yes.

53:53.663 --> 53:55.896
Want me to call someone up to
fix it? What's your desk number?

53:55.897 --> 53:58.362
- Hi, I'm with somebody whose printer is broken.
- Oh no, no. No, no.

53:58.363 --> 54:00.896
No, no, no, no, I actually need
the copy pretty urgently, yeah.

54:00.897 --> 54:03.829
Uh... it's a report of special
importance to the Colonel.

54:03.830 --> 54:05.562
He's taken a particular
interest in my findings lately.

54:05.563 --> 54:07.462
I haven't actually
met him in person,

54:07.463 --> 54:09.362
but I think he knows a lot about
my work, so maybe I'll just...

54:09.363 --> 54:13.796
Oh, that reminds me, you had
your date with James, did you?

54:13.797 --> 54:15.795
Was that last night?

54:16.963 --> 54:18.596
Did you want me to photocopy that?

54:18.597 --> 54:21.362
Yes, please. That is why I'm here.

55:04.696 --> 55:06.462
One copy.

55:06.463 --> 55:08.896
- So how'd it go?
- How did what go?

55:08.897 --> 55:12.796
With James. I just wanted to ask <i>'cause I
didn't see you on the train this morning.</i>

55:12.797 --> 55:14.696
Not that I'm in the habit
of seeing you on the train,

55:14.697 --> 55:16.362
but I wanted to ask 'cause
I made the introduction.

55:16.363 --> 55:17.796
- Thanks for the introduction.
- I wanted to make sure...

55:17.797 --> 55:19.675
That he didn't take
advantage of me?

55:20.429 --> 55:22.429
Did he?

55:22.430 --> 55:24.896
<i>Do that? 'Cause then
I'd feel responsible</i>

55:24.897 --> 55:27.329
- <i>'cause I made the introduction.</i>
- That's very kind of you.

55:27.330 --> 55:28.729
- <i>So you're okay?</i>
- I'm okay.

55:28.730 --> 55:30.562
Okay, good. Then
that's fine. Thank you.

55:30.563 --> 55:32.796
That's a relief, actually,
to me. That's relieved me,

55:32.797 --> 55:35.496
because I made the introduction
is all. Thank you, good.

55:35.497 --> 55:36.996
Guess who.

55:36.997 --> 55:39.029
Oh God. This is Melanie.
Hi, Melanie.

55:39.030 --> 55:40.696
- We've met.
- Have we?

55:40.697 --> 55:42.863
Yeah. Papadopoulos
asked me to tutor her.

55:42.864 --> 55:44.696
- He's the best teacher I've ever had.
- Thank you.

55:44.697 --> 55:46.696
- I'm learning a lot.
- Well, she's a good student.

55:46.697 --> 55:50.394
- Pupil, so. So we'll get back to work.
- A lot.

55:50.929 --> 55:52.561
Okay.

55:56.396 --> 55:58.462
I'm not actually meant to be
here, but I have a report

55:58.463 --> 56:00.662
that I think would be of
interest to Mr. Papadopoulos.

56:00.663 --> 56:02.063
Sorry, my name is Simon James,

56:02.064 --> 56:04.529
but I don't have my I.D.
Or my supplementary I.D.

56:04.530 --> 56:07.529
The only thing it hasn't been is
consistent. I'll be one moment.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.829
This is the report I
was telling you about.

56:09.830 --> 56:11.496
Great work, James!

56:11.497 --> 56:12.963
That's the type of
initiative I like.

56:12.964 --> 56:14.629
Oh, thank you, sir. I just
think a man should do

56:14.630 --> 56:16.829
the best he can possibly
do at the work he's doing.

56:16.830 --> 56:18.863
- But, sir, I...
- I don't know what I'm paying you for.

56:18.864 --> 56:21.362
This guy just started.
Why can't you work like that?

56:21.363 --> 56:22.042
I just started.

56:22.043 --> 56:24.629
Sir, I think I have to make
something clear here. I...

56:24.630 --> 56:25.929
Use words.

56:25.930 --> 56:27.863
Look, I'm not angry with you, son,

56:27.864 --> 56:30.362
I just hope you can raise the
level of your performance.

56:30.363 --> 56:32.496
Hell! Why don't you
work with James here?

56:32.497 --> 56:34.462
See if you can help him
put something together.

56:34.463 --> 56:35.863
I would really like that.

56:35.864 --> 56:38.429
Yeah, Mr. P, that's
a fantastic idea.

56:38.430 --> 56:40.461
I'm a good worker. I...

56:45.496 --> 56:48.294
So this is the great James Simon.

56:58.063 --> 57:00.096
This used to be my favorite song.

57:00.097 --> 57:02.029
There's no song playing.

57:02.030 --> 57:04.796
And you hate music.

57:04.797 --> 57:08.261
I think the nurse
stole my undershirt.

57:13.929 --> 57:17.096
You're right, I do hate music.

57:17.097 --> 57:20.427
<i>You're still not right.</i>

57:23.329 --> 57:26.028
Make the cut deep.

57:30.562 --> 57:32.329
- Oh, excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

57:32.330 --> 57:34.562
Did you know that people in
here are carrying weapons?

57:34.563 --> 57:35.763
Yeah.

57:35.764 --> 57:38.427
How long has this been going on?

57:38.996 --> 57:41.095
A while.

59:17.896 --> 59:19.396
Hello.

59:19.397 --> 59:22.329
Hannah, this is James.

59:22.330 --> 59:25.427
Come up. I want you.

01:00:30.796 --> 01:00:32.796
I want you to stop seeing Hannah.

01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:33.403
I see.

01:00:33.404 --> 01:00:35.728
And I want you to stop
messing around with Melanie.

01:00:35.729 --> 01:00:36.696
What else?

01:00:36.697 --> 01:00:38.796
And I want you to tell
Papadopoulos that I've been

01:00:38.797 --> 01:00:40.496
doing all your work for
you since you got here.

01:00:40.497 --> 01:00:43.429
Mm-hmm, okay. Well, I
wanna show Papadopoulos

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.962
this photo of you and his daughter.

01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:46.863
- Oh, well...
- How do you sleep?

01:00:46.864 --> 01:00:48.696
Yeah, I just...

01:00:48.697 --> 01:00:50.829
Now who do you think
Papadopoulos is gonna believe?

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.396
Some dink he still calls Stanley?

01:00:53.397 --> 01:00:55.294
Or this guy?

01:00:56.429 --> 01:00:59.396
So I need the key...
To your apartment.

01:00:59.397 --> 01:01:01.462
You see, Melanie is
a bit of a screamer

01:01:01.463 --> 01:01:04.028
and I don't want Hannah coming
up and making another scene.

01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:06.796
<i>It'll just be easier
if we use your place.</i>

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:09.128
<i>Now do you need to see the
photo again or are you okay?</i>

01:01:19.062 --> 01:01:22.629
I'll also be taking other women up there
in case you notice different smells.

01:01:23.864 --> 01:01:25.596
<i>Hey.</i>

01:01:25.597 --> 01:01:27.795
I'm James.

01:01:30.362 --> 01:01:32.961
Get up.

01:01:34.062 --> 01:01:35.995
Get up.

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:39.961
Or do you wanna die on the
ground, like a snake?

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:02.161
There he is.

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.729
- Hey, what are you working on?
- It's private.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.462
Can you please not lean
on my work station?

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:35.329
- So I need that key again.
- <i>No.</i>

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:36.895
- That was it. No more.
- All right, I understand.

01:02:36.896 --> 01:02:38.462
Hey, Mr. Papadopoulos.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.528
<i>Simon has something he
wanted to show you.</i>

01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:44.496
- Oh. Key.
- No, I can't.

01:02:44.497 --> 01:02:45.895
- Key.
- No.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.329
Key. I have more.

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:49.962
Fine.

01:02:49.963 --> 01:02:53.127
I'll get a copy cut.
Save future confusion.

01:02:55.763 --> 01:02:58.095
- Well, this better be good.
- Oh no, no, no, I'm sorry.

01:02:58.096 --> 01:03:01.629
You need to step up, Stanley. I
wanna see some real work from you.

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:03.662
Actually, I'm working on
something at the moment, sir.

01:03:03.663 --> 01:03:06.620
- Something that I...
- Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.

01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:10.763
Simon, I think that James
is seeing someone else.

01:03:10.764 --> 01:03:13.763
And he told me that you sometimes watch my
apartment from a telescope in your room,

01:03:13.764 --> 01:03:15.529
which I'm fine with actually,
I don't really mind.

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:16.962
It's kind of reassuring
in a strange way, but...

01:03:16.963 --> 01:03:18.562
Wanna go to the coffee
room? It's a little public.

01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:21.429
It could be interesting to find out who
else he's seeing. Are you hearing this?

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.662
- Does that mean he's not seeing you?
- Not that he's even trying to hide it.

01:03:23.663 --> 01:03:24.795
He's not a very good guy.

01:03:24.796 --> 01:03:26.862
Which I know and I always have known,
but to be made a fool of by him?

01:03:26.863 --> 01:03:28.729
One second. By a villain.

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.362
- I knew what he was...
- Oh no. It's not your fault.

01:03:30.363 --> 01:03:31.562
Then he'd say something
about how he knew me,

01:03:31.563 --> 01:03:34.795
that he could tell I was a lonely person,
because he knew what it was like

01:03:34.796 --> 01:03:36.795
to be lonely and
lost and invisible.

01:03:36.796 --> 01:03:38.895
Like...

01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:41.774
Like someone could just push
their hand straight through you.

01:03:43.396 --> 01:03:45.462
I think you should
definitely not see him.

01:03:45.463 --> 01:03:47.562
<i>He told me he felt like Pinocchio.</i>

01:03:47.563 --> 01:03:49.529
- Do you know who Pinocchio is?
- No.

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.529
He's this wooden boy.
He's held up by strings.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.529
He wants to feel like a real boy.
Do you understand?

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:54.928
- No.
- I feel like Pinocchio.

01:03:54.929 --> 01:03:56.662
Okay.

01:03:56.663 --> 01:03:59.529
So is that okay if I come
to your apartment tonight?

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:01.762
I know it's kinda strange to ask
but I wanted to see for myself,

01:04:01.763 --> 01:04:03.662
you know, if he's taking
girls back there.

01:04:03.663 --> 01:04:05.862
No, I'm sorry, that's not
possible because I have to work.

01:04:05.863 --> 01:04:08.062
I'm not gonna be home
tonight, I'll be here.

01:04:08.063 --> 01:04:10.095
But that's okay, you can
just give me your key.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:12.496
- I don't have a key.
- You don't have a key?

01:04:12.497 --> 01:04:13.321
No.

01:04:13.322 --> 01:04:14.995
You don't have a key
to your own apartment?

01:04:14.996 --> 01:04:17.562
- No.
- How do you get in?

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:19.362
- I can't get in.
- Why are you lying?

01:04:19.363 --> 01:04:20.795
I'm not. I just don't know...

01:04:20.796 --> 01:04:22.995
If it's a good idea
to spy on people.

01:04:22.996 --> 01:04:25.062
And...

01:04:25.063 --> 01:04:28.496
I think you might be
becoming a little obsessive.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.329
- Why are you touching me?
- I'm not.

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:32.362
I just...

01:04:32.363 --> 01:04:33.928
Also...

01:04:33.929 --> 01:04:35.994
Feel like Pinocchio.

01:04:38.529 --> 01:04:40.261
You're a snake.

01:05:58.462 --> 01:06:00.827
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:06:59.062 --> 01:07:00.928
<i>What is your name?</i>

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:03.127
I'm a visitor. I would
like to sign in.

01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:06.427
What is your name?

01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:10.028
My name is Simon James.

01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:13.461
You're wanted in worker
services, Simon James.

01:07:15.895 --> 01:07:18.596
Mmm.

01:07:19.629 --> 01:07:21.860
Mmm.

01:07:24.661 --> 01:07:26.995
Mmm. Poor chap.

01:07:26.996 --> 01:07:28.528
Oh.

01:07:33.396 --> 01:07:35.595
- You don't exist any more.
- Excuse me?

01:07:35.596 --> 01:07:38.728
- You're no longer on the system.
- Well, just put me back in the system.

01:07:38.729 --> 01:07:40.329
- I can't put you back in the system.
- Why?

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:42.695
Because you don't exist. I can't put
someone who doesn't exist in the system.

01:07:42.696 --> 01:07:45.528
- But I used to be in the system.
- Not according to the system. In fact,

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.728
according to the system,
you've never existed.

01:07:47.729 --> 01:07:50.695
- How reliable is the system?
- Hey, it's completely reliable.

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:52.928
Yes, but I used to
exist... I do exist!

01:07:52.929 --> 01:07:55.396
- I'm standing in this room, aren't I?
- And?

01:07:55.397 --> 01:07:58.329
- So how do I get back in the system?
- You need a card.

01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:59.862
- Right. So can I please get a new card?
- No.

01:07:59.863 --> 01:08:01.429
- Why?
- Because you're not in the system.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:02.862
So, it's... Well...

01:08:02.863 --> 01:08:04.762
So that's it?

01:08:04.763 --> 01:08:07.496
That's it.

01:08:07.497 --> 01:08:09.735
I'll leave you to make
your own arrangements.

01:08:20.995 --> 01:08:22.995
<i>- You okay, buddy?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:08:22.996 --> 01:08:25.495
- Thanks, Harris.
- Yeah, it's gotta be pretty rough on you.

01:08:25.496 --> 01:08:27.694
- Yeah, I guess it is.
- I, uh, got you this book.

01:08:27.696 --> 01:08:30.528
James told us about your problems.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:33.694
You need to read it pronto though;
it's only returnable through Friday.

01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:34.795
- Thanks.
- <i>No worries.</i>

01:08:34.796 --> 01:08:36.362
Hey, ah, I was just wondering...

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:37.895
<i>Yeah, I'll help you
with your report.</i>

01:08:37.895 --> 01:08:39.595
- If you could have it ready by tomorrow.
- Fine.

01:08:39.595 --> 01:08:40.728
- And tomorrow's Friday.
- <i>I know.</i>

01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:41.995
So both the book and
the report need

01:08:41.996 --> 01:08:43.362
- to be finished by tomorrow.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:08:43.363 --> 01:08:44.560
Friday. Yeah, oh, by the way,

01:08:44.562 --> 01:08:47.495
<i>if you're looking for James, he's
in the office with Papadopoulos.</i>

01:08:47.496 --> 01:08:50.795
Apparently he's written this incredible
report on how to increase efficiency.

01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:52.595
Yeah, pap's pretty impressed.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.495
Hey, you're fucking boring;
What's regression analysis?

01:08:55.496 --> 01:08:56.928
<i>Oh, this one is so silly.</i>

01:08:56.929 --> 01:08:58.962
<i>These two Chinese
virgins get married.</i>

01:08:58.962 --> 01:09:01.429
It's the night of the wedding,
they've just finished boning.

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:03.694
<i>And the husband says, "that was
great, that was really great.</i>

01:09:03.696 --> 01:09:05.661
Is there anything else
you'd like to try?"

01:09:05.662 --> 01:09:07.461
- And then the woman says...
- Mr. Papadopoulos?

01:09:07.462 --> 01:09:08.895
- Hold on a sec.
- No, it's okay.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.328
So the woman says, "I think
I would like to try # 69."

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:12.795
And the guy, he
thinks for a second.

01:09:12.796 --> 01:09:14.595
And... pay attention,
Rudolph, you'll like this.

01:09:14.595 --> 01:09:16.862
He says, "you want
breef with broccori?"

01:09:18.095 --> 01:09:20.560
It is silly. What did I tell you?

01:09:20.562 --> 01:09:24.895
- Sir. Sir, I think we need to talk.
- You! I can't believe you'd dare.

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:27.095
- Sir, I work here and I...
- <i>You pervert.</i>

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:29.560
James told me everything
about you and Melanie.

01:09:29.562 --> 01:09:31.862
Hell knows she's handsome,
she's a Papadopoulos,

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:33.995
but to abuse a young
woman's trust like that?

01:09:33.996 --> 01:09:35.928
Sir, this man is a fraud.

01:09:35.929 --> 01:09:38.528
You should talk!
He's the finest employee

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:40.362
- we've ever had.
- Oh, sir, thank you.

01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:41.962
He doesn't even know
what we do here.

01:09:41.962 --> 01:09:44.495
Er, this and that.

01:09:44.496 --> 01:09:46.395
Okay, what is regression analysis?

01:09:46.397 --> 01:09:47.828
<i>Who took your test for you?</i>

01:09:47.828 --> 01:09:49.828
Sir, I have been through
all of this in the report.

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:51.395
I think maybe he needs some help.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.461
- He's gone a little crazy.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:09:53.462 --> 01:09:55.862
No sir, this cannot stand.
No, no, no, no.

01:09:55.863 --> 01:09:58.095
Stay away from me. Stay
away from me. No, no, no, no.

01:09:58.096 --> 01:10:01.495
No. No sir, he stole my face.

01:10:01.496 --> 01:10:03.728
Look at me! Look at me!

01:10:03.729 --> 01:10:05.561
Look at him! He stole my face!

01:10:05.562 --> 01:10:07.495
<i>- You need to leave.
- No!</i>

01:10:07.496 --> 01:10:09.528
You do! Get off of me!

01:10:09.529 --> 01:10:12.762
<i>Stanley!</i>

01:10:12.763 --> 01:10:15.428
- Give Rudolph his arm back!
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:10:15.429 --> 01:10:16.728
Stay back! Stay back!

01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:18.528
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no, no.</i>

01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:20.528
Stay away from me! No,
I need to see the Colonel.

01:10:20.529 --> 01:10:22.862
- Stanley, we all love you.
- I need to see the Colonel.

01:10:22.863 --> 01:10:24.928
The Colonel will understand.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.995
- Please, where is the Colonel?
- You need help.

01:10:27.996 --> 01:10:30.361
- No, I don't need help.
- What's the problem, Stanley?

01:10:30.362 --> 01:10:32.361
Hey! You fuckers!

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:34.895
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

01:10:34.896 --> 01:10:38.361
You don't know who you're
dealing with, you fuckers.

01:10:38.362 --> 01:10:40.361
You fucking fucks.

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:42.661
I am a person.

01:10:42.662 --> 01:10:44.928
Stay back! Stay back, you fucks!

01:10:44.929 --> 01:10:47.095
<i>You fucking fuckers!</i>

01:10:47.096 --> 01:10:49.795
<i>I am a person!</i>

01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:51.128
I exist!

01:12:17.028 --> 01:12:18.795
<i>Here we are.</i>

01:12:18.796 --> 01:12:20.628
<i>Has she ever tried
anything like this before?</i>

01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:22.728
- No.
- No? First timer!

01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:24.862
Good stuff. Well,
these things happen.

01:12:24.863 --> 01:12:26.728
You mustn't blame yourself.

01:12:26.729 --> 01:12:28.795
Was it pills that she took?
I heard it was pills.

01:12:28.796 --> 01:12:30.695
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:12:30.696 --> 01:12:33.762
Fantastiche. How many pills
do you think she swallowed?

01:12:33.763 --> 01:12:37.795
I have nought to 10, 10 to
20, 20 to 30, or 30-plus.

01:12:37.796 --> 01:12:39.561
I don't know. I wasn't there.

01:12:39.562 --> 01:12:41.828
- <i>If you were to guess.</i>
- I'm not going to guess.

01:12:41.829 --> 01:12:44.428
- But if you had to guess.
- I don't have to.

01:12:44.429 --> 01:12:46.695
- Is she going to be okay?
- I'll just stick a little

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.361
question mark on it for the moment.

01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:52.094
What? What is it?

01:12:55.028 --> 01:12:56.728
All bloody morning, you know.

01:12:56.729 --> 01:12:58.828
How long have you two been married?

01:12:58.829 --> 01:13:00.762
Would you excuse us,
please, Martin?

01:13:00.763 --> 01:13:03.361
- Mr. James, can I have a word?
- Yeah, that's fine.

01:13:03.362 --> 01:13:05.028
I'll just keep going with this...

01:13:05.029 --> 01:13:07.927
And take care of this bloody guy!

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:11.561
<i>Has she tried anything
like this before?</i>

01:13:11.562 --> 01:13:13.728
No, I don't think so.

01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:15.995
<i>- Do you fight a lot?
- Sometimes.</i>

01:13:15.996 --> 01:13:18.695
<i>I'm afraid to say she's had
a miscarriage. I'm sorry.</i>

01:13:18.696 --> 01:13:21.395
<i>Was it your first pregnancy?</i>

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.828
- Yes.
- <i>The good thing is she's healthy</i>

01:13:23.829 --> 01:13:27.194
and it was very early, so she
won't feel too much pain.

01:13:28.461 --> 01:13:30.095
These things happen.

01:13:30.096 --> 01:13:32.426
You mustn't blame yourself.

01:14:23.595 --> 01:14:25.695
You probably think I
should be thankful

01:14:25.696 --> 01:14:28.360
that you took me to the
hospital, but I'm not.

01:14:29.561 --> 01:14:34.493
I wanted to die and now I'm afraid I
won't have the courage to try again.

01:14:36.361 --> 01:14:38.194
Do you wanna know what I think?

01:14:39.595 --> 01:14:42.293
I think that you
should kill yourself.

01:14:43.528 --> 01:14:47.094
I promise I won't try to
stop you halfway through.

01:16:47.695 --> 01:16:50.728
<i>Hi, uh, this is a message for...</i>

01:16:50.729 --> 01:16:52.895
<i>Simon James.</i>

01:16:52.896 --> 01:16:55.595
<i>Uh, your mother passed
away this morning</i>

01:16:55.596 --> 01:16:57.862
<i>following a major ce-ree-bral</i>

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.528
<i>s... ceree-bral?</i>

01:17:00.529 --> 01:17:02.561
<i>Cere-bral... Cerebral occurrence.</i>

01:17:02.562 --> 01:17:06.895
<i>Um, in accordance with her wishes,
she's to be buried at night.</i>

01:17:06.896 --> 01:17:09.395
<i>If you wish to attend the funeral,</i>

01:17:09.396 --> 01:17:11.461
<i>it starts at midnight
at the cemetery</i>

01:17:11.462 --> 01:17:13.828
<i>to the rear of the home.
Not the rear but, um...</i>

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:17.361
<i>To the... down the side and then
towards the rear of the home.</i>

01:17:17.362 --> 01:17:19.461
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

01:17:19.462 --> 01:17:21.561
<i>Yea, though I walk
through the valley</i>

01:17:21.562 --> 01:17:26.561
of the shadow of death I will fear
no evil for thou art with me.

01:17:26.562 --> 01:17:29.094
- <i>Thy rod and thy staff...</i>
- Don't look now.

01:17:29.095 --> 01:17:30.895
<i>They will comfort me.</i>

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:35.828
<i>Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.</i>

01:17:35.829 --> 01:17:37.661
Look look, we can get you help,

01:17:37.662 --> 01:17:39.661
but now is a time for family.
Just don't engage.

01:17:39.662 --> 01:17:41.395
Who are you? Who is this fuck?

01:17:41.396 --> 01:17:43.094
Why have you got his face?
Why have you got his face?

01:17:43.095 --> 01:17:45.661
- Just don't engage. Don't engage.
- Is he mental? Are you mental?

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:47.094
- Just don't engage.
- What are you doing?

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.395
- Okay.
- <i>Don't touch me!</i>

01:17:48.396 --> 01:17:49.895
- Don't engage.
- Oi!

01:17:49.896 --> 01:17:51.561
Oi!

01:17:51.562 --> 01:17:54.094
- Don't engage.
- Don't touch me!

01:17:55.696 --> 01:17:58.260
What is it?

01:18:03.628 --> 01:18:05.560
Get up.

01:18:06.094 --> 01:18:08.160
<i>Get off your knees.</i>

01:19:03.561 --> 01:19:05.426
Oh.

01:19:32.994 --> 01:19:34.762
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off!

01:19:34.763 --> 01:19:36.460
Oh hey, James.

01:19:46.796 --> 01:19:49.094
- Oh my God, look at you.
- <i>You know who I am, don't you?</i>

01:19:49.095 --> 01:19:50.927
- Are you okay?
- You recognize me.

01:19:50.928 --> 01:19:52.628
Of course. Simon,
what happened to you?

01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:54.728
I don't want to be a
boy held up by string.

01:19:54.729 --> 01:19:57.059
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:19:58.728 --> 01:20:00.560
Bye.

01:21:27.361 --> 01:21:29.794
Yes.

01:21:30.794 --> 01:21:32.826
I'm okay.

01:21:57.062 --> 01:22:00.260
<i>That is where I am.</i>

01:22:03.461 --> 01:22:06.093
Yes, I am looking at him now.

01:22:09.561 --> 01:22:11.727
He is about to jump.

01:22:11.728 --> 01:22:14.260
Please hurry.

01:25:19.395 --> 01:25:21.594
There aren't too many like you.

01:25:21.595 --> 01:25:24.193
Are there, Simon?

01:25:33.794 --> 01:25:36.959
I'd like to think
I'm pretty unique.
