WEBVTT

00:24.733 --> 00:26.985
Hey, man, my dang ol'
wife's in labor, man.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.486
Gonna go down to hospital.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.780
Have that Lamaze partner, man.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.949
Good evening, sir.
Do you know why I pulled you over?

00:33.783 --> 00:34.659
Because you beat me.

00:34.993 --> 00:35.910
I want a rematch.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.663
- Not here. This is a school zone.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.166
There's an amateur race
at the speedway this weekend.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.252
Winner drives the pace car
when NASCAR comes to town.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.212
Whoa, man. You talking
about that NASCAR, man?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.089
I've been trying over five years, man.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.924
To get on that dang ol' pace car, man.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.010
You going to get me on in there?

00:52.010 --> 00:54.137
I see I'm talking your language now.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.597
Here.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.477
I'm going to let that go.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.303
Okay, Bill, give her some gas.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.765
Eh, fuel mixture's still too rich.

01:44.813 --> 01:45.939
- Yep.
- Yep.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.066
Hey, Boomhauer,

01:48.066 --> 01:49.192
look at me.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.444
Maybe I can be a race car driver, too.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.742
Yeah, Bill,
you'd be a regular Dale Earnhardt,

01:57.867 --> 01:59.536
if you could make it around the track

01:59.536 --> 02:01.621
without stopping for a ding dong.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.706
Or you can do like Jeff Gordon did

02:03.790 --> 02:05.375
and have a rich daddy.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.252
I hate that Jeff Gordon.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.796
I bet I could be
NASCAR's top-money winner, too.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.090
If my daddy had bought me
a quarter-midget car,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.050
instead of, you know,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.511
corrective shoes
that all the girls laughed at.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.889
Yeah, his father didn't do him
any favors, I tell you what.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.309
My dad didn't buy me a car
when I turned 16.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.895
He sold me one, and it was a lemon,

02:25.979 --> 02:28.148
taught me the value of a dollar.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.024
My dad never sold me anything.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.902
Hey, Dad, could you
please sign this check?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.237
I already filled it out for you.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.615
Pay to the order of the bike barn.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.201
175 dollars?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.662
Well, it's for a new B.M.X bike.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.747
You expect me to just sign this?

02:44.831 --> 02:47.333
I think you have to or it doesn't work.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.211
Bobby, these checks aren't magic tickets.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.465
They represent real money that I,
and to a lesser extent, your mother,

02:54.549 --> 02:56.134
work real hard to earn.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.052
You can ride it whenever you want.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.805
My point is, you don't just get money

03:00.889 --> 03:02.140
because you ask for it.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.392
You want to end up like Jeff Gordon?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.727
I like Jeff Gordon!

03:06.269 --> 03:07.228
He's handsome.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.521
Mm-mm.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.692
Uh, Bobby, you joke around
like that in public,

03:12.692 --> 03:14.527
people are going to think you ain't right.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
Hey, guys little help here?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.283
Thank you very much.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.915
But Jeff Gordon is handsome,
and he's a great champion.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.252
He's the world's fastest Christian.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.213
He's a bad influence on our son.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.424
Bobby thinks the world
is just going to be handed to him.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.552
He has no concept
of the value of a dollar.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.595
Watch.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.596
Bobby, come here.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.099
Son, how much do you think
those shorts you're wearing cost?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.643
I don't know.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.519
They're pretty nice.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.854
100 dollars?

03:49.938 --> 03:54.150
Hmm... 100 dollars for a pair
of cotton short pants.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.861
What do you think the average salary is
in this country?

03:56.945 --> 04:00.114
Well, Jim Carrey
makes 20 million a movie...

04:00.198 --> 04:01.866
You see that?

04:01.991 --> 04:05.828
He doesn't even know the difference
between 20 million and 20,000.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.664
You know, Bobby,

04:07.956 --> 04:10.416
they say old Buck Strickland started out

04:10.500 --> 04:12.710
with nothing but a single dollar bill,

04:13.336 --> 04:15.922
and, now, he's at the
top of the propane ladder.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.216
Bobby, here's your dollar.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.635
Let's see what you can turn it into.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.270
What are you doing, son?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.939
Did you use that dollar
to start a shoeshine business?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.732
- What?
- Bobby!

04:34.816 --> 04:36.693
You almost made me drop it.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.987
This is what you spent your dollar on?

04:38.987 --> 04:39.946
No.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.531
I also got a quesadilla.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.533
It's from the value menu.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.701
Well, thank you, Hank.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.952
Your plan certainly backfired.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.620
You've spoiled his appetite.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.915
Okay, I guess I was wrong,
but I'll get through to him.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.750
There's a way in there.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.918
I know there is.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.795
Maybe it's time Bobby got a job.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.006
Hank, it's his vacation.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.090
He's just a boy.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.591
He should be doing boyish things.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.846
Bobby, how would you like
to go to cooking school?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.180
I'm listening.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.808
Bobby, I know we've
never talked about this

05:08.808 --> 05:11.269
but some day, I'm going to die,

05:12.020 --> 05:13.104
and when that happens,

05:13.646 --> 05:15.148
then you can go to cooking school.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.653
Come on, Bobby, you're coming
with me to the race track.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.625
Well, Bobby. What do you think?

05:34.709 --> 05:36.711
The rope is soft and pretty.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.172
Look at the pace car, Bobby.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.257
It's what Boomhauer gets to drive

05:41.341 --> 05:42.800
if he wins his amateur race.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.344
What's a pace car?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.679
Well, it's the car that
all the other drivers

05:46.763 --> 05:48.973
have to stay behind
at the beginning of a race

05:49.140 --> 05:50.308
or whenever there's a crash.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.061
If Boomhauer wins, he'll have the honor

05:53.061 --> 05:56.022
of driving on the same track
as Dale Earnhardt.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.275
Or, as you'd look at It, with Jeff Gordon.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.362
Jeff Gordon's a race car driver, too?

06:02.737 --> 06:05.448
I thought he was just a cereal box model.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.492
Hey, sodas here.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.993
Get your sodas.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.244
Hey, I'll take one.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.372
Nice hustle, son.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.248
I can rest when I'm dead, sir.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.917
You hear that, Bobby?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.543
That is a good attitude.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.921
That's what Mr. Witchard told us.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.005
He's my boss.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.758
Maybe someday,
you can land a job like this.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.551
Why not today?

06:26.260 --> 06:27.428
Mr. Witchard.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.890
I wonder if you have an opening
for my son, Bobby, here.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.017
If you work for Jimmy,
you're gonna work hard.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.852
People up there are hot and dry.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.437
They want something cold and wet.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.981
You do your job, you make money,
but you work hard.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.150
That's the way you work
if you work for Jimmy.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.861
So, if I understand you correctly,

06:43.945 --> 06:46.739
you're saying you'll teach my boy
the value of a dollar.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.699
If you work for Jimmy,
you gonna work hard.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.952
You make money.
The people are hot and dry.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.286
That sounds just fine.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.665
This is going to be
a great experience for you, son.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.292
My dad told me if I worked hard,

06:58.376 --> 07:00.586
I could be another Buck Strickland.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.089
Well, I don't know
who the hell Buck Strickland is,

07:03.256 --> 07:05.550
but my dad told me
I couldn't leave this job

07:05.550 --> 07:07.718
until I got someone to replace me.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.014
Good luck, Bobby.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.933
You're gonna need it.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.815
Oh, you look so good in that apron,

07:20.815 --> 07:23.401
like a cooking school professor.
Say cheese.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.610
Cheese.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.778
Don't smile, son.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.904
You're a working man.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.991
All right, now remember, Bobby.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.784
If there's a crash on the track,

07:31.868 --> 07:32.827
here's the fun saver.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.537
Try to get me two angles.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.039
Team Goodson takes the lead.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.835
Don't come a-knockin',
'cause these trucks are rockin'.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.135
Soda.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.595
Hey, soda here.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.472
- I got peanuts.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.389
Peanuts.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.268
- Ah!

07:57.852 --> 07:58.895
- Hey!
- Huh?

07:58.895 --> 08:00.188
Soda!

08:09.238 --> 08:10.198
Uh.

08:27.465 --> 08:31.385
- Ah, is that diet?
- Reg... Regular.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.303
Sorry.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.611
Hey, you, you want a hot dog?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.612
Sure.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.366
All right, 4.50 for a jumbo dog

08:53.366 --> 08:56.118
and 20 for a tray of stolen drinks

08:56.202 --> 08:59.080
and the 28 you owed me,

08:59.872 --> 09:00.748
now you owe me...

09:00.748 --> 09:03.751
Oh, yeah, you owe me 52.50, Tommy.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.295
I'm not Tommy. I'm Bobby.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.463
You making fun of me?

09:07.838 --> 09:08.881
You're tray 27.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.175
See? 27, Tommy.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.177
Go sell some sodas, Tommy.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.098
MR. WITCHARD: Ah! Oops.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.983
You know, maybe now's a good time
to run some pit crew drills.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.609
Time us, Boomhauer.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.528
- Bill, you clean the windows.
- Alright!

09:30.528 --> 09:32.405
Dale and me will take tire duty.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.702
- Okay. Go!

09:46.127 --> 09:47.044
Tire one, check!

09:47.128 --> 09:48.462
Tire one, check.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.422
Tire two!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.590
Time out!

09:50.590 --> 09:52.967
Man attached!

10:02.810 --> 10:03.936
Mr. Witchard?

10:04.312 --> 10:05.479
- Ooh!
- Huh?

10:06.897 --> 10:09.775
Mr. Witchard, I think I'm ready to go.

10:09.984 --> 10:14.071
Okay. You owed me 68.000 in trays,

10:14.697 --> 10:17.241
and you paid me 72 dollars.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.994
But you also owed me 40

10:20.202 --> 10:24.707
for a total of you owing me
eighty-eight thousand

10:24.707 --> 10:27.752
eighty-eight-eight hundred dollars

10:28.252 --> 10:29.378
and eighty-eight cents.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.140
Hey, there's our working man.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.477
Here, Bob, grab a root beer.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.438
Yup.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.442
You can say yup, too.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.654
- You've earned it.
- Dad, I want to quit.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.530
What? Quit?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.241
It's horrible, Dad.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.704
It's hot and the tray is heavy,
and my boss is really mean,

11:03.829 --> 11:07.291
and he calls me Tommy,
and he watches TV in a hot dog,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.418
and I think he might be a moron.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.880
Now, Bobby, I know your first day was hard

11:12.880 --> 11:14.840
but don't call your boss names.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.093
That's acting like a baby.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.762
Babies want everything handed to them.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.223
But you're there to work and not play.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.892
That's why it's called work and not play.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.019
And if you don't understand that.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.272
Well, son, maybe you're the moron.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.649
Okay.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.733
There you go.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.528
Now, what you need are a few pointers
on salesmanship.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.782
Remember, a good salesman
always says yes to the boss.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.828
He approaches every task
with a can-do attitude

11:43.828 --> 11:44.995
and when things get tough,

11:45.079 --> 11:47.540
he shrugs it off and sings a happy tune.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.669
This is that thing
about me giving 110 percent, right?

11:52.670 --> 11:56.173
Bobby, if you weren't my son, I'd hug you.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.262
That's tray number three, Mr. Witchard.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.347
I'm giving 110 percent.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.933
You know, I have to admit

12:05.933 --> 12:08.686
at first I didn't think
you were the best boss.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.645
I'm the boss.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.063
I know. I know.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.606
My dad set me straight.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.109
And I'm going to be
the best worker you ever had.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.110
You work for me.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.319
You bet I do.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.197
You're going
to see a whole new Tommy today.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.577
Uh... how would you want
to be my go-to guy?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.619
That's me.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.955
Okay. First, you go to the men's room

12:27.955 --> 12:29.373
and mop out the unirals.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.001
Then you go to my cigarettes in my car.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.627
Then go to back here.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.795
Can do!

12:35.963 --> 12:37.840
All right, give it another push.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.633
Dale, no faking this time.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.510
Dad! Dad!

12:41.594 --> 12:42.970
Your advice really worked.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.767
Mr. Witchard promoted me to go-to guy.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.895
Wow! I hope you'll still return my calls.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.607
You got any other success tips for me?

12:55.107 --> 12:56.108
Hmm...

12:56.192 --> 12:57.359
Well, uh...

12:57.943 --> 12:59.069
Here's a great one.

12:59.236 --> 13:03.657
Find the job nobody wants
and then do it better.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.159
I'll do it.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.453
- Better.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.246
You're the go-to guy.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.584
Welcome to the amateur classic 100.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.840
Oh, this is exciting!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.550
Isn't this is exciting?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.177
I'm excited, Hank.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.597
We'll get excited when Boomhauer
takes that checkered flag.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.724
Right now, we got a job to do.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.819
MR. WITCHARD: Smash it down good, Tommy.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.695
- Smash it... down.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.197
Smash.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.865
Yeah. Good, I said!

13:45.449 --> 13:47.701
Don't be afraid
of them bottles. They pop good.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.078
Make them pop good.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.162
- Smash!

13:50.412 --> 13:51.247
Oosh!

14:04.385 --> 14:05.636
All right, Boomhauer!

14:05.636 --> 14:07.263
Woo-hoo! Way to go!

14:07.263 --> 14:08.514
Guys, can we bring him in?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.682
Can we bring him in?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.433
His windows look pretty dirty.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.978
Well, he's probably low on gas.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.354
I'll set the flag.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.190
Hank, remember to keep Dale away
from the, uh...

14:18.649 --> 14:20.651
well... everything.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.491
I'll get the gas, check the tires
and the suspension.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.617
I'll get the windows.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.703
Dale, here's a bucket of sand.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.454
Hold it with both hands.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.624
Uh, Hank, what am I supposed
to do with the sand?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.126
It's slipping, Hank!

14:38.627 --> 14:39.712
Never mind.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.386
All set, Boomhauer.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.512
Go, go, go!

14:48.596 --> 14:50.180
- I think we did it, Bill.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.682
We kept Dale from screwing it up.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.934
Bill?

14:59.106 --> 15:00.941
Oh, man. Ain't supposed to be on windows.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.443
Dang ol', dang ol' weight up, man.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.947
You saying no? Can't say no to the boss.

15:07.031 --> 15:07.865
And I'm the boss.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.366
See?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.327
So put on the hot dog, you!

15:11.327 --> 15:12.328
No way!

15:12.786 --> 15:13.996
You put it on.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.873
I'll do it, Mr. Witchard.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.626
How come you keep wanting to do things
nobody wants to do?

15:19.043 --> 15:21.253
Because I've got a can-do attitude, boss.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.464
My dad says there's no limit

15:23.464 --> 15:26.175
to what a guy
with a can-do attitude can do.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.761
Maybe one day I'll even have your job.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.471
You're after my job?

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
Yes, sir!

15:33.140 --> 15:34.475
You think you're so good?

15:34.475 --> 15:35.893
You put on the suit.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.186
You put on the suit now.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.229
Oh.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.566
It looked to me like you could
have cut that guy off in the last turn,

15:42.650 --> 15:45.361
but fourth place is
nothing to be ashamed of.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.404
Hang in there, Boomhauer.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.365
You may not get to open the race tomorrow,

15:49.365 --> 15:51.367
but if there are just three accidents,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.452
you'll still get to drive that pace car.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.912
Aw, give it up, Hank.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.705
The man's dream is no more.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.832
No! We can't give up now.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.544
You know, it was just the other day
my boy wanted to quit his job

16:02.711 --> 16:04.088
because it was too tough.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.424
And today, well, I think
you know how this story ends up.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.178
Bobby Hill has become the go-to guy.

16:13.514 --> 16:17.101
<i>♪ Whenever I feel afraid, I... ♪</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:18.310
Ow!

16:18.936 --> 16:21.397
<i>♪ A happy tune ♪</i>

16:21.814 --> 16:23.107
<i>♪ And no one ♪</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:24.108
Ow!

16:24.358 --> 16:25.234
Dang!

16:34.910 --> 16:36.412
Bobby, what are you doing up?

16:36.412 --> 16:37.788
It's 5:30 in the morning.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.041
Jimmy wants me to strain
the bugs out of the fryer

16:41.125 --> 16:42.876
before the oil gets too hot.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.421
Well, you know what they say,

16:45.796 --> 16:47.297
"Find what your niche is.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.216
That leads to riches."

16:49.717 --> 16:51.885
Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, Dad.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.973
But sometimes I still think
Jimmy Witchard ain't right.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.224
Now, Bobby...

16:57.224 --> 16:59.768
But then I remember about 110 percent.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.479
That's the spirit.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.443
And we have record attendance today

17:07.443 --> 17:12.990
with 62,427 fans.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.951
Ahh, that's a lot of people.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.245
And it's hot.
They're going to want drinks.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.997
I know that. You think I don't know that?

17:20.581 --> 17:23.792
People are hot and dry.
They want something cold and wet. Tommy!

17:23.876 --> 17:26.879
It's nice, but where are
the cigarette ads?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.922
Hey, look, It's Dale Earnhardt.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.299
And he's coming this way.

17:30.966 --> 17:35.387
It's the intimidator. Oh, oh, oh.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.724
Hey, man, remember
that dang ol' third turn.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.311
Darnit, man. I just wanted to turn it lose
just make it go "wooo", I tell you what.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.814
Man, this rope sure is soft and pretty.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.317
I noticed it when we unloaded my car.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.824
And the honorary pace car driver

17:55.908 --> 17:59.495
to start the race.
Officer Clint Radar Jensen.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.247
Winner of the amateur classic 100.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.797
Well, cars are getting good traction.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.799
We're not going to see many crashes today.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.383
Yep.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.593
Yup.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.845
So, okay. We wave this sign around

18:16.929 --> 18:18.138
and Jeff Gordon sees it.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.307
Then, he comes up to us in the stands

18:20.307 --> 18:22.392
and is so taken by our charms

18:22.476 --> 18:24.853
that he asks one of us to marry him.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.272
Well, honey, it probably won't be me.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.607
I have got a ring on my finger.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.776
Yeah, and big feet.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.322
I'm only ignoring that
because a man is on fire.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.913
Two down. one to go.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.833
Soda. Get your soda.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.959
Hey, what timing.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.086
We're all ready for a cold soda.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.548
I don't know. It looks like
Bobby's sweat on 'em.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.299
I had some milk. Don't even need it.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.426
It's on me.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.053
- Oh, goodie.
- Oh, thanks.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.182
Bobby, these sodas are hot.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.935
Son, you got to find a way
to be more efficient.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.603
Listen to Mr. Witchard.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.813
He'll tell you what to do.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.314
Okay.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.568
Witchard? Jimmy Witchard?

19:12.568 --> 19:15.654
You told Bobby to listen
to Jimmy Witchard?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.114
He was in my gun club.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.784
People say he fried his brain one day
just staring at the sun.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.538
Course, he couldn't have been too smart
to do that in the first place.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.665
It's kind of a Chicken-egg thing.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.506
- You made me thirsty.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.049
- I need a soda.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.928
Hey! Hey, you! Tommy!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.305
I need a soda!

19:41.805 --> 19:43.974
Yes, Mr. Witchard.

19:43.974 --> 19:44.975
MR. WITCHARD: Not that way!

19:44.975 --> 19:46.310
Just run across.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.686
- But the track...

19:47.686 --> 19:49.521
Don't back-talk the boss, man.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.648
Ain't you never crossed a highway?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.567
Just run when there ain't any cars.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.694
They're going too fast.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.530
Do it, you... you monkey boy!

19:58.614 --> 19:59.823
I'm the boss of you!

20:04.745 --> 20:05.621
What the heck?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.997
Bobby, no!

20:09.917 --> 20:10.959
What are you doing?

20:11.043 --> 20:14.338
I'm going to cross the track
and bring Mr. Witchard a soda.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.341
That's crazy.
Why would you do something like that?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.676
I'm giving 110 percent, Dad.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.762
- MR. WITCHARD: Go to here, go-to boy!

20:21.762 --> 20:22.971
I want a soda!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.681
Go to now, you!

20:29.937 --> 20:32.648
There's a crazy man on the track.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.775
- Oh!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.694
And there goes Gordon
into the wall

20:38.904 --> 20:39.863
Daddy!

20:40.530 --> 20:41.406
You're up.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.076
- Boomhauer, Boomhauer, Boomhauer, yeah!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.002
You can't get me.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.813
Hey, Bobby, whatcha doing,
playing a video game?

21:12.813 --> 21:14.439
Uh... okay.

21:15.023 --> 21:19.027
Uh, I just wanted to say
I should've listened to you

21:19.111 --> 21:21.905
when you said how bad
that Witchard guy was.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.950
I almost died.
I'd rather not talk about it.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.369
Bobby, you worked harder this month

21:27.369 --> 21:29.246
than any guy on this block,

21:29.246 --> 21:31.373
and I want to give you
the money you earned.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.417
Dad, I don't want money.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.918
I was happy before

21:35.002 --> 21:36.920
when you just bought all
the stuff around here

21:37.004 --> 21:39.006
and there was no money involved.

21:39.881 --> 21:43.010
Well, still, I'd like to give
you a couple hundred dollars.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.386
I tell you what.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.472
Just buy me a couple
of pairs of short pants,

21:47.556 --> 21:48.724
and we'll call it even.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.598
MR. WITCHARD:
<i>Do it, you... you monkey boy!</i>
