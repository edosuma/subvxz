WEBVTT

00:09.010 --> 00:11.376
Take this, all of you, and drink from it.

00:11.596 --> 00:13.757
For this is the chalice of my blood.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.562
Please! I beg you!

00:26.777 --> 00:29.610
I am a simple man of God!

00:32.450 --> 00:33.485
You lie.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.284
Would a simple servant of God
have this?

00:44.462 --> 00:46.043
You're no more a priest than I am.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.628
Here's your burning bush.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.546
So talk to your God.

01:09.445 --> 01:13.779
It is Burke. Op-sec 3828.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.407
We have a situation.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.421
Officer Collins. Martin Wilcox.
We spoke on the phone.

01:33.636 --> 01:34.842
Of course.
Detective, thanks for coming.

01:35.054 --> 01:38.512
Susan, this is Detective Wilcox with
Metro P.D. I've brought him up to speed.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.840
Mrs. Ames, we'll do whatever
we can to find your husband.

01:41.060 --> 01:46.100
Thanks. Eugene disappears sometimes
to Atlantic City, once to Vegas...

01:46.315 --> 01:50.558
...but he always calls, and he's never
gone for more than a few days.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.645
And I understand there's some incident
that happened before his absence--

01:53.864 --> 01:57.322
Eugene came home.
He said he got an anonymous tip...

01:57.535 --> 02:00.493
...about trespassers over
by one of the marina docks.

02:00.705 --> 02:03.242
The lieutenant went to check it out,
came back about an hour later...

02:03.457 --> 02:04.492
...said he got the scare of his life.

02:04.709 --> 02:08.372
He ran into an FBI agent
on one of the old ships...

02:08.587 --> 02:10.748
...said she pulled out a gun
as he was boarding.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.375
An FBI agent?

02:12.591 --> 02:13.876
Said the FBI agent was looking
for two fugitives...

02:14.093 --> 02:15.799
...who escaped Cumberland
the night before.

02:16.012 --> 02:18.879
If something happened to Eugene,
it's got to be one of them.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.133
Don't you think?

02:20.349 --> 02:22.055
This agent he spoke with...

02:22.268 --> 02:24.099
...is there any chance
your husband got a name?

02:24.312 --> 02:27.804
He did better than that.
She gave him a card.

02:28.024 --> 02:30.857
Special Agent Elizabeth Keen.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.445
I've never seen anything like it.
What is it?

02:33.654 --> 02:37.442
I don't know. It was.... Ithink it
contains some kind of message.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.239
-Where'd you get it?
-I need you to see...

02:39.452 --> 02:41.693
...if you can figure out what it is,
how it works.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.779
There are people who are far more
qualified at this than me.

02:44.999 --> 02:48.207
-But none that I know and trust.
-I hope I'm interrupting.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.501
-Yes.
-No.No.

02:50.713 --> 02:53.125
-You're not answering your phone.
-So leave a message.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.047
Dembe did. Two, in fact.

02:55.259 --> 02:58.376
-We have a new case, Agent Keen.
-Then tell Cooper.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.837
That's not how this works.

03:01.057 --> 03:05.926
I think I left my soup in the microwave.
Lobster bisque.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.351
I know exactly how this works.

03:07.563 --> 03:10.726
You lie, say what you need to say to
make me believe you actually care.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.727
-That's not true.
-You're after the Fulcrum.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.149
It's why you're here.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.819
Not to help me or protect me
or whatever spin you're selling today.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.067
Well, I'm not buying it.
From this point on...

03:19.283 --> 03:22.525
...there's no reason for us to talk
unless it's about the work.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.576
Fine. Then let's work.

03:24.789 --> 03:29.579
I think you'll find today's most intriguing
story on page 20, bottom-left corner.

03:29.794 --> 03:33.457
"According to Uzbek authorities,
Father Aleksandr Nabiyev...

03:33.672 --> 03:36.334
...a local priest in the Tashkent
region of Uzbekistan..."

03:36.550 --> 03:39.041
You're intrigued because
a priest was kidnapped?

03:39.261 --> 03:43.049
No. I'm intrigued
because the priest is not a priest.

03:43.265 --> 03:47.474
From what I hear, the good
Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.553
That's a crime, Agent Keen.
Going back to the Cold War...

03:50.773 --> 03:55.267
...the CIA has a long and controversial
history of using religious figures...

03:55.486 --> 03:58.819
...as spies in violation
of executive orders...

03:59.031 --> 04:03.866
...internal CIA policy and promises
made by every president since Ford.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.034
-You know who kidnapped this agent?
-I do.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.989
Unfortunately,
he's an associate of mine.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.119
His name is Rus/an Denisov.

04:11.335 --> 04:15.419
He commands a nasty,
little band of separatists know as SRU.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.122
Translated,
they are the Supreme Republic...

04:18.342 --> 04:22.130
...of a free righteous
and independent Uzbekistan.

04:22.346 --> 04:26.589
I told Rus/an it was a bit much,
but he can be quite melodramatic...

04:26.809 --> 04:30.427
...not to mention violent
and entirely unreasonable.

04:30.646 --> 04:34.889
Politics are his passion,
and to fund his separatist agenda...

04:35.109 --> 04:37.350
...he's become something
of an abduction mogul...

04:37.570 --> 04:40.778
...specializing in senior executives
of foreign corporations...

04:40.990 --> 04:44.027
working in
or passing through the region.

04:44.243 --> 04:48.202
He holds them for ransom
at prices far above market standard.

04:48.414 --> 04:52.498
Your company has made it clear it has
no interest in paying for your release.

04:53.711 --> 04:56.077
And you do business with this man?

04:56.297 --> 05:00.506
Don't underestimate the usefulness
of a nasty band of armed separatists.

05:00.718 --> 05:05.007
But lately,
Ruslan's been breaking promises.

05:05.222 --> 05:09.056
His temper has cost me and my partners
considerably more than he's worth.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.758
So everybody wins.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.266
You help us rescue the agent,
we eliminate a thorn in your side.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.477
Careful on this one, Lizzy.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.275
You have more than just a blacklister
to worry about this time.

05:20.488 --> 05:24.276
The CIA will do whatever it takes
to keep this quiet.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.984
Richard Gagnon, Executive VP for a
French video-component manufacturer.

05:28.204 --> 05:29.785
Here he is before he was taken...

05:29.997 --> 05:34.787
...and here he is the day SRU released
him in exchange for 2 million cash.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.084
We have a list of over 30 victims.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.708
I don't understand. This guy makes
a fortune taking corporate execs.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.381
Now he takes a CIA agent.
Why change the business model?

05:42.593 --> 05:45.005
-Let's find him and ask.
-I'm sorry. But people's faith is sacred.

05:45.221 --> 05:48.304
-Religion should be off-limits to spies.
-Wou|dn't work in my country.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.633
Yeah, well, the agency knows the law,
so they've gone this far...

05:51.852 --> 05:53.888
...something big is going on in
that area.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.810
It's a simple question, Mr. Heyworth.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.356
ls Father Nabiyev
an operative of the CIA or not?

05:59.568 --> 06:03.732
-We all know that would be illegal.
-That's not an answer to my question.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.688
Not to my knowledge.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.365
I didn't call this meeting
to make a case against the agency.

06:08.577 --> 06:12.069
We're here because I have an informant
who can help get your man back.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.496
If he were our man, and I'm saying if...

06:14.708 --> 06:16.744
...the agency would handle this
on its own.

06:16.961 --> 06:20.874
If an American citizen's been kidnapped
overseas, that's FBI jurisdiction.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.331
If he's your asset,
I can keep you involved.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.008
If not, you're out.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.093
Agent Cooper, your task force
will run point on the investigation...

06:32.309 --> 06:35.972
-...and any hostage negotiations.
-My people can leave tonight.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.687
Commander Kushan. I'm Agent Keen.
This is Agent Ressler.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.522
On behalf of the bureau,
we appreciate your help.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.448
Let me be very clear, Agent Keen.

06:50.661 --> 06:54.449
It is you who are here to help me.
This is an Uzbek military operation.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.498
All due respect, sir,
an American citizen has been abducted.

06:57.710 --> 07:01.544
Which is why we have extended
the courtesy of our invitation.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.588
But you will not be negotiating
with Ruslan Denisov...

07:04.800 --> 07:06.756
...and you will not be negotiating
with me.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.675
And you will turn over your firearms.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.219
If that's a problem
and you wish to return to your country....

07:11.432 --> 07:16.301
-No. No problem.
-My men will escort you to your hotel.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.559
-We're being watched, 1:00.
-I didn't notice him.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.766
I was too busy checking out
Hugo Boss on the corner.

07:23.986 --> 07:27.820
Whoever he is, he isn't a fed. That suit
wasn't bought on a government salary.

07:29.033 --> 07:34.323
The other one, the watercolorist, she....
Legs like a shot-putter.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.075
She gets me in this headlock.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.747
I black out.

07:38.959 --> 07:43.623
Next thing I know, I wake up,
no sheets, Vaseline everywhere.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.798
The lipstick on the mirror overhead
reads, "Same time next year?"

07:48.010 --> 07:51.753
I haven't missed
an art expo in Basel since.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.970
Lizzy! Please excuse me.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.979
-What are you doing here?
-I promised to help.

08:02.191 --> 08:05.308
I can't be an effective resource
if I'm thousands of miles from the action.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.018
It's not safe.
We just saw the CIA at the airport.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.650
-They see you--
-|'|| be sure to say hello.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.232
Uzbekistan has no extradition treaty
with the United States.

08:13.452 --> 08:17.411
-Who are your friends over there?
-Go get cleaned up. We'll have dinner.

08:17.623 --> 08:22.834
I know a wonderful little hole in the wall
that's actually in a hole in a wall.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.331
What's going on with you
and Reddington?

08:29.551 --> 08:32.759
-You two have a little lover's quarrel?
-I don't trust him.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.962
Reddington's untrustworthy?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.272
Welcome to my country.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.827
The FBI in Uzbekistan.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.531
For a year, I tried to get your attention.
Now here you are...

09:02.751 --> 09:05.458
...because the only thing Americans
understand is violence.

09:05.671 --> 09:09.334
If you know so much, you'd know
we don't pay ransoms to terrorists.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.883
One man's terrorist,
another man's freedom fighter.

09:13.095 --> 09:16.462
I don't want your money,
not for myself anyway.

09:16.682 --> 09:21.221
As you can see, business is good.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.305
I took your Agent Burke
for another reason completely.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.810
Burke? That's his name?

09:28.026 --> 09:31.393
Almost 25 years ago,
my country sold an American company...

09:31.613 --> 09:36.357
...Anneca Oil, the rights to build a pipeline
through Tashkent to Andijan region.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.533
The price was absurd.

09:38.746 --> 09:43.115
The Uzbek people received
a fraction of the value.

09:43.917 --> 09:48.126
Corruption. Well, you know.
These things happen, and I don't care.

09:48.338 --> 09:52.627
-But now the pipeline is leaking.
-Leaking?

09:52.843 --> 09:56.210
Hundreds of villagers have been killed,
hundreds more are sick...

09:56.430 --> 09:57.886
...and the company does nothing.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.307
Our lawyers are no match
for your wealthy attorneys.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.134
The American embassy looks away.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.016
The CIA is here, watching,
doing nothing...

10:07.232 --> 10:10.315
...reporting on any threats
to your American interests.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.109
-Mr. Denisov--
-I took one of theirs.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.983
A vice president of Anneca Oil.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.986
I tell him that there are chemicals
in the water that we drink...

10:18.202 --> 10:21.069
...that our children bathe in.
But he says no.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.075
The company did tests.
The water is safe.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.574
So I did a test of my own.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.116
...so you can show the others the truth.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.412
The negotiations for
your Agent Burke begin tomorrow.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.831
We saw hostages, at least four.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.125
Not Agent Burke,
but he's probably there.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.455
-We have got to find that compound.
-That won't be easy.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.211
Local army can't even find them.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.259
We got your photo of the guy
Denisov released, the Anneca VP.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.087
Compared it to known company
execs and got a match...

11:22.307 --> 11:24.639
-...Jeffrey Hanover.
-How long ago was he taken?

11:24.852 --> 11:26.217
That's the thing. I don't know.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.098
From what I can tell,
Anneca never reported him missing.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.430
-You're kidding.
-Tried to handle it privately.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.982
If that pipeline is leaking,
they don't want attention.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.150
Yeah, well, I'll tell you one thing.

11:36.363 --> 11:41.903
Whatever it was eating
at Hanover's flesh, it wasn't just water.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.952
He should survive.
His skin has been burned, corroded.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.198
And the chemicals?

11:46.415 --> 11:48.201
Consistent with prolonged exposure...

11:48.417 --> 11:51.454
...to benzene
and polycyclic hydrocarbons...

11:51.670 --> 11:53.581
...commonly associated
with oil development.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.788
Thank you, doctor.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.346
Agent Ressler.
Dean Walker, EVP at Anneca.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.015
Just wanted to say thanks
for bringing Jeff home.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.683
-It's all part of the job.
-| just flew in.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.309
Company sent me straightaway. If there's
anything you need, I'm here to help.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.934
Yeah, I doubt that.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.938
We saw you this morning
watching us at the airport.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.361
How long have you really been here?

12:20.365 --> 12:22.902
Three weeks. The company
sent me to deal with Denisov...

12:23.118 --> 12:25.074
-...to work something out.
-Privately?

12:25.287 --> 12:28.575
Jeff's family wanted that. They
were afraid if the FBI got involved....

12:28.790 --> 12:31.452
-You're the ones who were afraid.
-We've got nothing to hide.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.410
This leak Denisov's talking about,
he's the one responsible.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.871
It's a scam.
His men sabotage the pipeline...

12:37.090 --> 12:39.672
...demand a fortune
because the locals are getting sick.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.467
So this is how you respect
my operation?

12:42.679 --> 12:45.842
-I told you, you have no authority here.
-Denisov contacted us.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.175
I know this is your case,
but if Denisov wants to talk to the FBI--

12:49.394 --> 12:51.225
-Not an option.
-It's an option...

12:51.438 --> 12:53.099
...if Denisov says it's an option.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.055
He's holding an American hostage.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.106
A Frenchman, a German
and many others.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.731
I'm sorry. You can't order us
not to talk to him.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.439
I could arrest you and your partner
for interfering in my investigation.

13:03.659 --> 13:07.072
What investigation? You've been tracking
this guy for over a year.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.154
He's still abducting innocent people,
holding them for ransom.

13:10.374 --> 13:13.992
You and your partner will remain at
the Tashlan Hotel under military guard.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.701
If you try to leave...

13:15.921 --> 13:19.789
...your stay in Uzbekistan will be
a lot longer than you bargained for.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.546
Well, you certainly make friends fast.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.757
Truth is, I'm impressed.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.264
Not with you, with Ruslan.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.096
He never really struck me
as a man of the people.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.898
The guy's a psychopath.
He's in over his head.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.773
He doesn't know anything
about pipelines.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.823
-Agent Keen is late.
-She's having room service.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.116
What, are you in the doghouse?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.611
Oh, that's a shame.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.617
She's gonna miss the most tantalizingly
delicious Khorem baklava.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.246
Ruslan's a criminal.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.327
Even if Anneca comes to the table...

13:59.548 --> 14:02.460
...Denisov would have
no idea what to ask for.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.962
Guy doesn't know
enough to know what he wants.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.841
-The lawyers would eat him for lunch.
-You may be right.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.639
-When's the next sit-down?
-Tomorrow morning.

14:11.852 --> 14:16.721
Well, given your new entourage,
I gather you may need my help to attend.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.478
Actually, I think we've got that covered.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.209
Mr. Denisov, thank you for
your willingness to talk to us.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.885
The bureau spoke with Anneca Oil, and
the good news is, they want to fix this.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.802
That is good news.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.882
To be honest, I was a little worried.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.717
I mean, who am I? I'm just a criminal.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.770
I don't even know enough to know
what I want.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.019
I will not be negotiating
this deal myself.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.896
I'm bringing in a professional...

15:04.112 --> 15:07.696
...someone to make sure that the
company lawyers don't eat me for lunch.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.400
Mr. Denisov,
it is my pleasure to be here. Hello.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.032
My name is Raymond Reddington.
And you are?

15:20.837 --> 15:24.830
I've spoken to my agents.
They assure me Agent Burke is alive.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.792
-So where are we?
-My people are concerned.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.344
They were driven to a village less
than 40 miles from the SRU compound.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.842
They saw the damage being done
by the pipeline firsthand.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.425
Wait. Your people know
where the compound is?

15:36.645 --> 15:40.263
Not the exact location, but based on
drive time and the terrain...

15:40.482 --> 15:43.315
...we think the compound
is near the southeast base...

15:43.527 --> 15:44.733
...of the Zarafshan range.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.776
We can have a black-ops team
on the ground tonight.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.728
That's a mistake. We don't know...

15:48.949 --> 15:51.361
-...if Agent Burke is there.
-|'|| take that chance.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.612
And destroy their trust with Denisov...

15:53.829 --> 15:56.366
...and endanger the lives
of those still on the ground?

15:56.581 --> 15:59.072
I agree. At this point,
a raid is premature.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.408
Agent Cooper,
I'm assuming your informant...

16:01.628 --> 16:05.541
-...can be of assistance on this one?
-He's right at the center of this.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.418
Then we stay the course for now.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.046
I will see to it that every one
of your interests...

16:10.262 --> 16:14.471
...and expectations are met
or exceeded.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.642
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.937
It's been a while.
Did I screw up already?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.390
You're not really gonna negotiate
for Denisov?

16:24.609 --> 16:28.648
You're the one who insisted that
our interaction be strictly professional.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.903
You gave us this case to help us get the
agent back, not represent the other side.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.702
Agent Keen, in this world,
there are no sides, only players.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.121
Are we really supposed to sit here
and hammer out a deal?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.416
Absolutely not. I was thinking
we might get out for a bit.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.836
The first day of negotiation is rather
like the first day of school.

16:47.048 --> 16:51.542
-Get out? Where?
-Let's go on a field trip, shall we?

16:59.895 --> 17:03.604
What you're smelling is benzene,
a common pollutant in oil production.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.773
It's in the air we breathe
and the food we eat.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.315
This way.

17:12.199 --> 17:18.195
We boil all our water for drinking and add
andrographis to counteract the toxins.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.449
-Does that work?
-No.

17:20.665 --> 17:24.704
Carcinogens are ingested
and cause melanomas...

17:24.920 --> 17:29.880
...damage internal organs,
lung, liver, and kidney failure.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.002
Somewhere, 6,000 miles away...

17:32.219 --> 17:35.882
...a group of bean counters in a
boardroom did a cost-benefit analysis...

17:36.097 --> 17:38.258
...and concluded
these people aren't worth...

17:38.475 --> 17:41.012
...the cost of responsibly maintaining
their pipeline.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.311
Exec I talked to, he said your men
were sabotaging the pipeline.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.309
-Said it was a scam.
-My youngest brother...

17:47.525 --> 17:49.857
...died of benzene poisoning last year.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.864
So who's the hostage here,
Agent Burke or these poor devils?

17:56.076 --> 17:59.739
Look, I don't care what math they did.
No company can ignore this.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.412
-It's bad for business.
-If someone can prove it.

18:02.624 --> 18:06.162
Anneca spends a fortune on lobbyists
to make sure that doesn't happen.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.118
We can contact
the State Department...

18:08.338 --> 18:10.374
...see if they can apply some pressure...

18:12.926 --> 18:17.215
And I can see to it that Agent Burke
is released unharmed.

18:17.430 --> 18:22.094
See? No sides. Only players.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.681
-Keen.
-Agent Keen. I'm glad I caught you.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.398
You're not easy to reach.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.222
I'm sorry. Who is this?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.273
Detective Martin Wilcox, Metro P.D.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.568
Cooper's ofﬁce gave me your number.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.987
-Hope I caught you at an okay time.
-What's up?

18:38.618 --> 18:43.203
The vic actually works for the PD.
It's a Lieutenant Ames, harbormaster.

18:43.915 --> 18:44.950
How can I help?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.157
[heard you ran into each other...

18:47.377 --> 18:50.835
...on one of the harbor rigs. You gave him
one of your business cards.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.788
Right. Right.

18:53.008 --> 18:56.500
You said something about the FBI
searching for fugitives out of Cumberland.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.429
Thing is, I've made a few calls and
nobody seems to know anything about it.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.221
It didn't happen. It was a cover.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.550
I couldn't tell the lieutenant at the time.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.760
Any chance
you can share it with me now?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.938
-Might help me clear this case.
-I'm sorry.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.936
Well, you have to tell me something.

19:12.152 --> 19:16.065
You're there alone, draw your weapon,
give a false story. Raises some questions.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.192
I’ve already said more than I can say.

19:18.408 --> 19:22.526
May I ask, Lieutenant Ames,
who reported him missing?

19:22.746 --> 19:25.328
His wife. Married 32 years.

19:27.042 --> 19:31.160
Well, I hope you find him, detective.
Good luck.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.805
You told Ruslan the State Department
was open to the idea of an inquiry.

19:48.021 --> 19:52.560
-You haven't touched your baklava.
-You told him and he's not interested?

19:54.569 --> 19:57.106
-Just one bite.
-I didn't come here for the baklava.

19:57.322 --> 20:00.189
I came here to talk
about the negotiation.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.945
A Russian milonga.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.664
Watch closely, Lizzy.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.458
Everything you need to know
about negotiation...

20:12.670 --> 20:17.004
...is there in the tango milonga.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.334
-We've got eyes on the SRU compound.
-You spoke to the commander?

20:20.512 --> 20:22.753
Yes, sir. He knows we want
this resolved tonight.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.133
I want full deniability for the agency.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.636
Get out in public,
far away when this happens.

20:27.852 --> 20:28.967
We have to stand down...

20:29.187 --> 20:32.850
...but local authorities dealing with local
issues, can't do anything about that.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.522
Understood.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.650
At the outset, they are opponents.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.576
Each has something the other wants.

20:47.789 --> 20:52.408
They size one another up,
assessing risk...

20:52.627 --> 20:54.492
...setting boundaries...

20:55.672 --> 20:59.130
...challenging each other
to breach them.

20:59.342 --> 21:02.300
A sensuous battle.

21:03.012 --> 21:08.803
Violence and sex
balanced on the blade of a knife.

21:09.018 --> 21:14.684
Nothing given that is not earned,
nothing taken that is not given.

21:14.899 --> 21:19.859
This is the pure essence
of negotiation.

21:20.822 --> 21:25.191
Not a poker game, but a milonga.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.244
A tango.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.325
A seduction.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.969
What's wrong?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.548
Everything.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.152
Commander, we have searched
all the buildings.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.860
There is no sign of the hostages,
including the American.

22:17.253 --> 22:20.791
-When exactly did this happen?
-Last night around 2100 hours.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.374
Uzbek special forces are reporting
a full-scale raid of the compound.

22:24.594 --> 22:28.052
It was the CIA. The man in the restaurant,
he wanted to be seen in public.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.299
What about Burke?

22:29.516 --> 22:31.632
Went this far,
better have found him alive.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.887
Report says
they haven't found him at all.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.479
It was an all-out assault.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.021
At least a dozen SRU fighters
were killed by an army unit led by--

22:39.234 --> 22:42.317
-Commander Kushan.
-How did he find the compound?

22:43.238 --> 22:47.402
Heyworth. That son of a bitch
was ordered to stand down.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.584
-Who's on the phone?
-Cooper.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.583
Harold! Good.
I want you to hear this.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.755
Reddington, you know
this wasn't our move.

23:04.968 --> 23:08.426
-The CIA--
-The CIA did what the CIA does.

23:08.638 --> 23:12.881
I expected as much, which is why
Agent Burke and the other hostages...

23:13.101 --> 23:14.932
...were moved from that compound.

23:15.144 --> 23:19.979
The question is, why on earth you
would share the compound's location...

23:20.191 --> 23:23.274
...with the very people
I advised you not to trust.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.397
I'll deal with Heyworth.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.820
Oh, Heyworth is the least
of your troubles now.

23:28.032 --> 23:32.901
I warned you about Denisov.
I told you he was violent and unstable.

23:33.121 --> 23:36.033
How do you think he'll react
to losing a dozen of his men?

23:36.249 --> 23:38.831
-You think he'll kill Burke?
-I have no idea.

23:39.043 --> 23:44.754
But now I'm afraid Denisov may not
trust me and I certainly don't trust you.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.627
The negotiations are over.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.045
-I was stupid to trust you.
-Ruslan.

23:52.265 --> 23:56.133
I was stupid to think that they respected
us or would deal with us fairly!

23:56.352 --> 23:58.968
Take a breath.
I told you to move the hostages.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.679
You did. Your assets are intact.

24:01.899 --> 24:05.483
He was left behind at the compound,
abandoned by his commander.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.152
Ruslan, he's more valuable alive
than dead.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.900
Not to me.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.779
I hope that made you feel better.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.202
Apparently not.

24:30.470 --> 24:34.634
The CIA killed you, do you understand?
They did this!

24:34.849 --> 24:39.388
Sacrifice the bishop.
Reykjavik, '72.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.970
God, I can remember it
like it was yesterday.

24:42.190 --> 24:47.605
I was in Steven Bash's rec room down
in the basement, eating a fried egg...

24:47.820 --> 24:50.687
-...and bologna sandwich when he did it.
-Did what?

24:50.907 --> 24:54.115
-Who did?
-Bobby Fischer.

24:54.327 --> 24:59.617
It was game 13, move 50,
rook takes bishop, B5.

24:59.832 --> 25:03.074
He sacrificed his bishop.

25:03.461 --> 25:07.329
That's when Russia lost the Cold War.
It was staggering.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.335
Spassky had no answer because
he had no endgame...

25:10.551 --> 25:13.042
...and neither do you.

25:14.013 --> 25:18.803
When you capture and kill a CEO,
you incur the wrath of a company.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.555
When you capture and kill
a CIA agent...

25:21.771 --> 25:24.638
...you incur the wrath
of the US. government.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.690
That's boots on the ground,
drones overhead.

25:27.902 --> 25:30.143
What will be your answer to that?

25:30.363 --> 25:35.733
My men were murdered.
A message has to be sent.

25:35.952 --> 25:38.068
You're only seeing the next move.

25:38.287 --> 25:43.122
People have been pillaging your
country's resources since time began.

25:43.334 --> 25:47.043
Someone has to offer
a better alternative.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.042
That someone could be you.

25:50.258 --> 25:55.594
Ruslan, there is an endgame here
that you don't yet see.

25:55.805 --> 25:59.047
But you see it, don't you,
Agent Burke?

25:59.267 --> 26:04.261
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Denisov here is so blinded by anger...

26:04.480 --> 26:07.392
...he thinks this problem started
when he became aware of it.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.520
But you and I both know
that's not true.

26:10.737 --> 26:15.481
-Why don't you tell us about Zhabin?
-I don't know anything.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.237
The CIA put you here for a reason.

26:18.453 --> 26:23.163
They violated their own policy and
federal law to hide you among locals...

26:23.374 --> 26:25.751
...because there's a secret
they want to protect.

26:25.960 --> 26:30.329
-Now tell us about Zhabin.
-No.

26:31.841 --> 26:34.628
Make no mistake, Mr. Burke.

26:35.720 --> 26:41.465
My friend here is still making the bed
he'll have to lie in for the rest of his life.

26:41.684 --> 26:46.053
But my bed is made, and I assure you
my bed accommodates...

26:46.272 --> 26:48.183
...a broad spectrum of behavior.

26:48.399 --> 26:51.482
So you tell us
what little you know about Zhabin...

26:51.694 --> 26:54.777
...or I'll put you in the ground myself.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.616
-Give me the gun.
-Leonid Zhabin.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.865
He's the former cabinet minister,
part of the old Soviet regime.

27:04.081 --> 27:07.164
Ran this whole region from
the late ’703 to the early '903.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.504
A ruthless, corrupt, evil man.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.671
He gave Anneca the right
to build the pipeline.

27:13.883 --> 27:17.842
And in return, he got a massive kickback
and part of the ownership interest.

27:18.054 --> 27:22.093
Possibly insane, very religious now,
as if that can save him.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.142
All these sick people are his fault.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.742
Come Holy Spirit
and all blessed Archangels...

27:46.958 --> 27:51.247
...Angels and Saints of God.
Pray for me, a sinner. Amen.

27:51.462 --> 27:56.001
Why does the Lord hide
his face from me?

27:56.217 --> 27:58.503
Maybe he doesn't like you.

28:00.012 --> 28:05.348
For you, I'm afraid absolution
won't be quite so easy to obtain.

28:09.605 --> 28:15.225
I need all the details of exactly
how the Anneca Oil rights were sold...

28:15.444 --> 28:21.440
...for how much, including gratuities,
contingencies and all the participants.

28:21.659 --> 28:26.904
I want absolution in the next world,
not a life in prison in this one.

28:27.707 --> 28:31.916
Understandable. But it's
the confession, not the priest...

28:32.128 --> 28:34.414
...that gives us absolution.

28:41.512 --> 28:44.800
The US. government says
this isn't torture. What do you think?

28:54.150 --> 28:56.436
-Let me talk, please.
-Look at yourself.

28:56.652 --> 29:01.487
Rich as Croesus and you let Anneca
Oil poison your own countrymen.

29:01.699 --> 29:05.442
We didn't just poison our countrymen.

29:05.661 --> 29:09.449
We killed them, hundreds of them.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.207
Looks like we're hostages now, too.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.539
Ressler, I think I'm in trouble.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.509
-You think you--
-I got a call from Metro P.D.

29:23.721 --> 29:28.681
They've got a missing-persons case,
the DC. harbormaster.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.475
He showed up
where I was holding Tom.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.303
Whatever you're about to confess,
Keen, don't.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.935
I didn't kill him. I didn't. It was Tom.

29:37.151 --> 29:41.645
Tom? Why would Tom kill the one
person in a position to rescue him?

29:41.864 --> 29:45.322
To protect me.
I realize how insane that sounds.

29:46.327 --> 29:50.115
I met the harbormaster the first time
he showed up and gave him my card...

29:50.331 --> 29:52.617
...told him I was searching
for two fugitives.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.210
-You lied to him.
-To explain why I was there.

29:55.419 --> 29:59.037
I had no idea Tom would kill him.
I tried to stop it.

29:59.256 --> 30:02.965
Witnesses? Somebody must have been
watching Tom while you weren't there.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.969
There was someone.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.008
-Thanks for coming down.
-Look, I don't think I can help you.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.559
You can't keep me here.

30:14.897 --> 30:17.809
Take it easy.
Nobody's keeping you here.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.859
Just want to ask you a few questions,
then you're free to go.

30:23.781 --> 30:26.898
Tell me about Elizabeth Keen.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.280
-Where have you been?
-Good news.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.084
I've reconsidered our position.
Negotiations will resume immediately.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.547
-Did you talk to Denisov?
-No questions.

30:40.756 --> 30:44.590
-Burke's dead, isn't he?
-No. We have new evidence to present.

30:44.802 --> 30:46.667
There is one proviso, however.

30:46.887 --> 30:50.471
That mouthpiece from Anneca,
the one you spoke to? Bring him along.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.925
Wait, wait. We can't leave.
Kushan's doubled the guards outside.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.180
It's too risky.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.808
[may need to have a chat
with this Commander Kushan.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.731
We'll come to you. See you in an hour.

31:02.778 --> 31:06.487
We've been through this.
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:06.699 --> 31:11.318
Well, you are Samuel Aleko...

31:11.537 --> 31:14.028
...the same Samuel Aleko
who was the custodian...

31:14.248 --> 31:19.288
...for an abandoned vessel docked in
DC. harbor, a rig called the Phoenix.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.209
Zebra mussels.

31:21.422 --> 31:26.212
Yeah, I gotta say, Sam, I've seen
guys tripped up by a lot of things...

31:26.427 --> 31:30.261
...but zebra mussels?
Yeah, that's a first.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.508
There it is. Yeah, see?

31:35.728 --> 31:38.219
You spoke to the shellfish inspector.

31:38.439 --> 31:42.273
You refused to let him board,
and you promised to vacate the slip.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.853
See? I know you were there.

31:50.409 --> 31:54.368
You gentlemen are doing
a wonderful job. Sorry. Sorry.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.196
Traffic coming into the city.
Price of progress.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.032
This is Dean Walker from Anneca.
Who's this?

32:00.252 --> 32:03.164
The smoking gun.
That sounded dramatic.

32:04.298 --> 32:07.836
Leonid Zhabin. This is the new evidence
that you were talking about.

32:08.052 --> 32:10.964
Ex-minister Zhabin hasn't been
in power for 20 years...

32:11.180 --> 32:14.513
...and with all due respect, sir,
the man is not mentally well.

32:14.725 --> 32:18.183
Perhaps not, but "in a mad world,
only the mad are sane." Kurosawa.

32:19.105 --> 32:22.017
-What the hell is he talking about?
-History, Mr. Walker.

32:22.233 --> 32:26.522
My new friend knows a great deal about
the history of your company's pipeline.

32:26.737 --> 32:31.481
-History is not new evidence.
-Or maybe it is.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.067
As it turns out,
we do agree on one key detail.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.529
Your company's current pipeline
is not the worst thing on earth.

32:38.749 --> 32:41.331
-Then what is?
-The first pipeline.

32:41.544 --> 32:46.755
The one Anneca built in 1988,
four years before the current one.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.332
Is that what he told you?
The man is delusional.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.799
We broke ground to build it in '92.
Read the contracts.

32:55.015 --> 32:59.304
-You're right. The contracts do say that.
-It started before the wall fell.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.479
Uzbekistan was still a constituent
republic of the Soviet Union.

33:03.691 --> 33:06.478
Mr. Gorbachev was changing
our future.

33:06.694 --> 33:10.061
I was allowed to secretly open
our markets for an American pipeline.

33:10.281 --> 33:11.316
This is fiction.

33:11.532 --> 33:15.946
I sold the rights to them that year and
they built the first pipeline right away.

33:16.162 --> 33:21.782
You couldn't even wait to do it right!
We were all so greedy.

33:22.001 --> 33:26.995
The first line was an unmitigated disaster.
Hundreds were killed.

33:27.214 --> 33:31.002
Whole villages became ill.
I still see their faces.

33:31.218 --> 33:34.130
Then the Soviet Union collapsed
and all hell broke loose.

33:34.346 --> 33:38.339
Anneca paid Mr. Zhabin
to orchestrate a cover-up.

33:38.559 --> 33:43.849
Bury the dead, destroy any record
that the first pipeline ever existed.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.682
It wasn't the only disaster cloaked
by those momentous events...

33:47.902 --> 33:51.736
...hidden from view in the fog
of a new world order.

33:52.406 --> 33:57.867
It's a good story. But that's all it is,
a story from a crazy old man.

33:58.078 --> 34:01.491
Who happened to keep a complete set
of the original documents...

34:01.707 --> 34:06.326
...in the hope that one day, he might
find the courage to set things right.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.831
You engineers did better
the second time around.

34:09.048 --> 34:11.664
At least this one took 20 years
to start leaking.

34:11.884 --> 34:15.968
If this is true, and Anneca is responsible
for hundreds of people's deaths...

34:16.180 --> 34:19.513
...then you and the other high-level
executives will be prosecuted.

34:21.268 --> 34:25.728
Reparations can be paid to
the alleged victims. We can fix this.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.477
Reparations are all well and good...

34:28.692 --> 34:31.900
...but the people I represent
don't want you to fix it.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.569
-They don't?
-No.

34:34.782 --> 34:38.991
The Uzbek people have had
quite enough of Anneca's promises.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.569
They want you to leave.

34:41.747 --> 34:45.114
Pack up your pipeline and leave.

34:45.334 --> 34:46.995
That won't happen.

34:47.211 --> 34:50.169
Mr. Denisov thought you might need
some additional incentive...

34:50.381 --> 34:52.918
...so Mr. Zhabin was kind
enough to direct him...

34:53.133 --> 34:57.752
...to one of the mass graves where
victims of the first pipeline are buried.

34:57.972 --> 35:04.138
His men are on their way there now.
I can stop them if we have a deal.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.012
Can I get some water, please?

35:09.858 --> 35:11.689
Yes! Of course.

35:11.902 --> 35:15.815
This is the water they drink in the villages,
the ones directly above your pipeline.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.692
Drink up.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.695
Talk to your board.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.407
You have 24 hours until we go public.

35:32.798 --> 35:37.667
Effective immediately, Anneca Oil
has elected to cease operation...

35:37.886 --> 35:41.470
...of its local pipeline.
And we are thrilled to announce...

35:41.682 --> 35:45.675
...some exciting and highly profitable
new initiatives on the horizon.

35:45.894 --> 35:49.386
We got to go. SRU just confirmed.
Agent Burke's being released.

35:49.606 --> 35:52.439
-Where?
-Outside the city.

35:52.651 --> 35:56.644
--construction of three new schools for
the people of this great country.

35:56.864 --> 35:59.981
Thank you.
And now I'll take a few questions.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.026
Commander Kushan.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.245
It's good to meet you.

36:07.458 --> 36:10.541
I've heard nothing but terrible things.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.623
What kind of deal
are we talking about?

36:13.839 --> 36:17.423
Depends on what you've got to say,
how valuable it is to the case.

36:17.634 --> 36:21.923
I can take you to the body.
Is that valuable enough?

36:33.025 --> 36:35.937
They should be here any time now.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.769
Director Heyworth, the agents are on site.
Please advise.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.526
Do not move until they take possession
of the asset.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.824
SOG team is standing by,
awaiting your go.

36:44.036 --> 36:47.199
Once the exchange is complete,
I want Reddington taken into custody.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.700
If Denisov shows, kill him.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.796
Car's arriving now, sir.
Team leader, stand by.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.748
Can you confirm Reddington
is in the vehicle?

36:59.968 --> 37:01.674
Affirmative.

37:11.605 --> 37:14.096
Agent Burke. Welcome back.

37:20.697 --> 37:25.282
We have eyes on target.
Reddington's out of the car, sir.

37:25.494 --> 37:27.780
Nobody moves until I give the order.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.282
-Hey, Arnold.
-Sir, I tried to stop him.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.911
-You and I have a problem.
-Take a step back, Harold.

37:33.127 --> 37:35.083
You ignored
a Justice Department directive.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.956
You told Kushan about that compound.

37:37.172 --> 37:40.209
-You can't prove that.
-My people are there to protect your asset.

37:40.426 --> 37:43.088
-I cannot confirm--
-Anything happens to those agents...

37:43.303 --> 37:46.716
...the next time your phone rings,
it'll be the Attorney General calling.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.006
Sir, standing by for your order.

37:49.226 --> 37:52.844
Sir, our window's closing. Requesting
authorization to take immediate action.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.521
Stand down.

38:09.705 --> 38:14.039
I need your help. Commander Kushan
and his men are at my compound.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.582
His men are.

38:16.336 --> 38:19.624
-If you can get me out of the country....
-I can.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.917
But I won't.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.500
-They will arrest me.
-Perhaps.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.805
Sooner or later,
we all must pay for our crimes.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.762
ls Kushan....

38:32.978 --> 38:35.594
You still don't see it, do you?

38:36.398 --> 38:38.184
The endgame.

38:39.485 --> 38:42.977
You could run this country, Ruslan.

38:43.197 --> 38:45.813
What you've done is that important.

38:47.201 --> 38:53.868
You brought a multinational corporation
to its knees, saved countless lives.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.290
You'll make this country billions.

38:57.711 --> 38:59.997
You may go to prison for a bit.

39:00.214 --> 39:03.422
But you will emerge a hero.

39:04.510 --> 39:08.503
One of the few standing in your way
is Commander Kushan.

39:09.306 --> 39:12.264
Well, not standing.

39:33.997 --> 39:38.366
-Commander Kushan?
-More on this breaking story.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.201
Just hours after Anneca Oil
announced that they are...

39:41.421 --> 39:43.548
...shutting down its pipeline...

39:43.757 --> 39:45.543
...comes this surprising development.

39:45.759 --> 39:48.671
The government and French
Oil conglomerate Savil/ion...

39:48.887 --> 39:52.345
...have reached a deal to nationalize
a brand-new pipeline.

39:52.558 --> 39:56.892
The deal, said to be worth billions,
should gain easy approval...

39:57.104 --> 39:59.311
...and will be ﬁnalized within days.

40:07.281 --> 40:11.445
I never saw it coming.
I knew you had to have an angle.

40:11.660 --> 40:16.871
Elizabeth Keen, this is Claude Hippeau,
Senior vice president of Savillion.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.539
You were having drinks together
the day we arrived.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.616
You knew exactly
what was gonna happen.

40:21.837 --> 40:23.623
I had an inkling.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.379
Give my regards to the wife
and the mistress.

40:30.596 --> 40:33.588
That's why you wanted Anneca
to abandon the pipeline...

40:33.807 --> 40:36.549
...to clear the way for another company
to get the contract?

40:36.768 --> 40:39.259
You say that as if it's a bad thing.

40:39.896 --> 40:44.856
Anneca shuts down operations,
the victims are well compensated...

40:45.068 --> 40:46.649
...maybe get a little justice...

40:46.862 --> 40:50.195
...a new firm is poised to deliver
a state-of—the-art pipeline...

40:50.407 --> 40:51.487
...everybody wins.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.112
You get a payday from Savillion
for making it happen.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.698
Vive la France.

41:03.253 --> 41:05.335
-Hey.
-Did you find anything?

41:05.547 --> 41:08.505
No. I mean, yes.

41:08.717 --> 41:12.710
Looks like some kind of Beta technology.
A recording device.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.887
I'm thinking it's late '803, early '90s.

41:16.099 --> 41:19.591
But how it works, what it does...

41:19.811 --> 41:22.143
...I don't have the faintest idea.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.935
Have you spoken
to Mr. Reddington about this?

41:30.155 --> 41:31.861
-No.
-But he might have some insights.

41:32.074 --> 41:36.317
You have to tell me, promise me,
you will not talk to Reddington about this.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.743
Mum's the word.

41:51.885 --> 41:56.049
We got a deal, right?
No jail time if I testify?

41:57.307 --> 41:59.684
You're not gonna believe
what I have to say.

42:00.602 --> 42:03.059
Tell me about Elizabeth Keen.
