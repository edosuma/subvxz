I think these are for you.
I'm pretty sure I'm a genie, Lizard.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.177
The wish you gave to the Knave,
he used it to end your suffering,

00:10.260 --> 00:12.095
and as a result, he granted me my freedom.

-Oh, thank God it's you.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.283
I am the Jabberwocky.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.953
We need to get out of Wonderland
before Jafar gets us.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.956
When he gets you,
he's gonna have all three genies.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.708
Those other genies...
they're my brothers.

-Upping the ante.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.318
With a compass?

01:08.402 --> 01:10.404
It's a golden compass
with magical properties.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.032
It'll point you to anything you've lost
in your life and you wish to find again.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.326
In your case, it might be some soap.

What do you say, gentlemen?
In or out?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.709
That's enough, brother.
Better to quit while we're ahead.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.460
Quitting while you're ahead
is still quitting.

to prove I cheated,

good hands in a row, Cyrus.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.942
-Not even me.
-He cheated.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.445
Come, come. It's only considered cheating
if I get caught.

02:33.529 --> 02:34.530
(LAUGHS)

02:34.613 --> 02:36.657
Otherwise, it's considered luck.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.742
One day, your luck will run out, Cyrus.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.036
You have to learn to play

The whole time Jafar had me captive,

03:14.152 --> 03:15.362
he had my brothers right there.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.780
How could I not have noticed?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.073
Cyrus, don't punish yourself.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.908
Even Jafar didn't know
about your relations.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.994
If he had, he would have
definitely used it against you.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.246
Either way, we're going to do
whatever it takes to free them.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.415
And me? That's my house
he's holding now,

03:26.498 --> 03:28.584
and, frankly, I hate it.
There's not a lot of elbow room.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.878
-And you know what else there isn't?
-Please don't tell us.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.296
-A toilet!
-Anyway...

03:32.713 --> 03:35.257
The first thing we need to do
is determine where the bottles are.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.009
If Jafar's moved into your palace,

03:37.092 --> 03:39.178
do you think he would have moved
the bottles with him?

03:39.261 --> 03:41.180
-Absolutely.
-Well, in that case,

03:41.263 --> 03:43.182
we just need to break
into the palace and take them.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.975
Oh, yeah, 'cause it's really that simple.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.853
The four of us are no match
for Jafar's magic.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.439
The only thing that's gonna
protect us is an army...

03:50.522 --> 03:51.773
My army.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.276
In case you haven't noticed,
your army has deserted you.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.571
Your former subjects are willing
to let you get eaten alive by mome raths.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.073
Yes, I'm quite aware
of people's feelings about me.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.118
I'm just gonna have to prove them wrong.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.747
Why fight Jafar
if we can simply disarm him?

04:06.830 --> 04:09.333
My brothers and I weren't born genies.
We were cursed.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.835
-So if I can break that curse...
-We can free them.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.880
I'm particularly fond about the bit where
you get the genies out of the bottles.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.964
That's good.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.300
Well, if I can get back to the place
where the curse was made,

04:18.383 --> 04:19.885
perhaps I can find a way to undo it.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.470

what happens if you fail?

is another chance for Jafar

04:52.459 --> 04:53.919

save Will is an army.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.344
and there's nothing that I can offer you
to make up for what you've already lost,

11:17.427 --> 11:19.638
but what I can say is, I'm sorry, Rabbit.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.223
Terribly sorry.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.393
(SIGHS)

11:24.768 --> 11:26.144
What's done is done.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.564
Why do you care if I forgive you?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.649
Because I need your help.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.693
With what?

11:32.776 --> 11:35.362
Becoming the queen
that everyone deserves.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.573
I want to defeat Jafar,

11:37.656 --> 11:40.534
reclaim Wonderland,
but not for me, for the people,

11:40.617 --> 11:43.537
and I need you to tell them
that they can trust me.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.165

completely lost her mind?

11:47.291 --> 11:48.792

11:50.210 --> 11:52.504
Whether or not she's capable
of it, only time will tell.

11:53.881 --> 11:57.426
Unfortunately, defeating Jafar
has become the least of your problems.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.844
Why is that?

11:58.927 --> 12:01.513
Jafar has released the Jabberwocky.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.682
How? Uh...

12:03.765 --> 12:05.475
-What's a Jabberwocky?
-Who told him?

12:05.559 --> 12:06.727
I don't know how or why.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.729
-I just know she's out.
-Is that bad?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.732
I suppose now you'll want me
to take you out of Wonderland

12:11.815 --> 12:13.025
before she finds you.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.319
-That sounds like an excellent...
-No! We are not leaving.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.403
Not going.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.282
I said that I was gonna save Wonderland,
and I meant it.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.577
If the Jabberwocky has been released,
all the more reason to stay and fight.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.496
Now, Rabbit, I'm not gonna
force you to do anything,

12:26.580 --> 12:28.040
but if you care about Wonderland,

12:28.123 --> 12:29.750
what it once was
and what it can be again,

12:29.833 --> 12:31.627
then I'm gonna need you to help me.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.772
RED QUEEN: Yeah, if the Jabberwocky
has been released,

12:51.855 --> 12:53.690
it's not safe for any of us
to be out in the open.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.817
I can't help but notice
we're still actually out in the open.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.070
-Don't be so scared, okay?
-Well, stop scaring me, then.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.655
Will, I'm being serious.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.907
The Jabberwocky feeds off fear.
She can smell it.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.743
Remind me again why we didn't take
the Rabbit's offer to leave Wonderland?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.246
-Because Jafar's gonna destroy Wonderland.
-The real reason.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.248
The Rabbit might have bought
that performance,

13:09.331 --> 13:10.832
but he doesn't know you like I do.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.919
You don't do anything that's not about
making life more comfortable for you.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.462
So what's your angle?

13:15.546 --> 13:16.922
There is no angle, Will.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.590
I... I made a mistake.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.760
I tried to rewrite the past
and fix things between us,

13:21.844 --> 13:24.263
and instead, I just ended up
destroying the future.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.975
It's not about making life
more comfortable for myself,

13:28.767 --> 13:32.771
because I'll never be comfortable again...
not without you in my life.

13:34.064 --> 13:36.775
But I... I can make everyone else's life
more comfortable,

13:36.859 --> 13:39.778
and the only way I can do that
is by getting rid of Jafar.

I cannot... will not let her die

to atone for that mistake.

Would you take
that from me, brothers?

I have something else in mind.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.771
We've been down this road before.
We both know how it's going to end.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.440
I'm the master of the genie.
I have three wishes.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.192
In order for your little spell to work,

23:20.275 --> 23:22.986
I have to make those wishes
so the genie goes back in the bottle.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.821
I couldn't have said it better myself.

23:25.531 --> 23:27.282
Well, you've got nothing
to threaten me with.

23:27.783 --> 23:30.494
Can't kill me. Can't kill Will.

23:31.370 --> 23:32.788
Right again.

23:32.871 --> 23:35.249
I'd say you're out of moves, Jafar.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.918
Why don't you untie me?

23:38.502 --> 23:41.046
We can come to
some sort of an agreement.

23:41.797 --> 23:44.550
Did our partnership
mean nothing to you?

23:44.967 --> 23:48.095
I had a partner...
once, a long time ago.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.055
Her name was Amara...

23:50.138 --> 23:52.516
Lovely woman, much like yourself.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.184
And also like you,

23:54.268 --> 23:56.937
she believed firmly in cooperation.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.898
Unfortunately,
we did not see eye-to-eye

23:59.982 --> 24:02.568
on the best way
to achieve our goals, so...

24:03.861 --> 24:06.655
I found another use for her.

24:07.781 --> 24:08.824
Touching.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.784
I always get what I want.

24:10.868 --> 24:14.037
One way or another,
you will make those wishes.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.708
What happens next,
it can either be painful

24:17.791 --> 24:20.127
or severely painful.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.045
Choose wisely.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.423
As Amara now knows...

24:26.216 --> 24:28.760
there are fates far worse than death.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.681
You heard him. Make your wish.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.099
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.893
Just wish him out of Wonderland now.

24:35.976 --> 24:36.977
Aah!

24:37.311 --> 24:38.854
Jafar, I wish you out of...

24:41.982 --> 24:43.233
(INAUDIBLE)

24:44.776 --> 24:48.780
It would never have worked out
between us, darling,

24:49.364 --> 24:50.741
but don't feel bad.

24:50.824 --> 24:51.867
I moved on.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.036
I found someone else,

24:54.119 --> 24:56.288
-someone promising.
-(DOOR OPENS)

25:12.179 --> 25:13.597
We need her wishes.

26:01.436 --> 26:02.688
You again.

26:02.771 --> 26:05.023
Have you come to steal more water?

26:05.107 --> 26:07.901
-I don't want your water.
-Then what is it you want?

26:10.028 --> 26:11.488
I want your mercy.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.408
You should know better than anyone.

26:14.491 --> 26:18.328
I do not dispense mercy
to those who do not deserve it.

26:18.412 --> 26:20.414
Please. I beg you.

26:20.706 --> 26:23.083
All things happen for a reason.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.212
Only with time
will you understand what that reason is.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.510
You made it.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.727
CYRUS: That's it, <i>Maman.</i>

26:42.477 --> 26:43.478
That's it.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.118
Your water... she needs more.

27:24.144 --> 27:27.648
(SIGHS) Perhaps this was her fate
all along.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.126
Yes.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.674
It's a miracle.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.471
Come on, come.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.558
You're alive, Amara.

28:02.641 --> 28:05.602
Your sons... they saved you.

28:10.399 --> 28:12.109
A wish released me from the bottle,

28:12.192 --> 28:13.861
released me from your curse.

28:14.278 --> 28:16.613
Now that I'm free, I beg for your mercy.

28:17.197 --> 28:20.117
Not for myself, but for my brothers.

28:20.576 --> 28:21.827
They are innocent.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.621
They took from me, as did you.

28:24.705 --> 28:26.832
They did only as I asked of them...

28:26.915 --> 28:28.625
what I demanded of them.

28:29.626 --> 28:32.921
It was my fault.
I was foolish. I was arrogant.

28:33.005 --> 28:34.381
But I understand now.

28:34.882 --> 28:36.133
After spending lifetimes

28:36.216 --> 28:38.427
granting the wishes
of other arrogant fools,

28:38.510 --> 28:40.929
I understand there are no shortcuts.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.223
That sometimes life is...

28:45.267 --> 28:46.810
as it should be.

28:47.895 --> 28:49.646
I have learned my lesson.

28:50.898 --> 28:53.609
Don't punish my brothers
for my arrogance.

28:55.444 --> 28:56.528
Please.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.363
I beg you.

28:58.447 --> 28:59.948
Release them from their curse.

29:01.283 --> 29:05.412
Only when the water is returned
can the curse be lifted.

29:05.495 --> 29:07.039
I can't return the water.

29:07.206 --> 29:09.499
I gave it to my mother
over 100 years ago.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.335
I'm afraid she's long dead now.

29:11.418 --> 29:12.836
No.

29:13.337 --> 29:14.588
Your mother lives.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.717
That's not possible.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.513
Return the water,
and the curse shall be lifted.

29:23.388 --> 29:24.681
Tell me where I can find her.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.309
No, wait! Please, no!

29:27.392 --> 29:28.894
Tell me where she is! Wait, please!

Come back! Where is she? Come back!

29:42.199 --> 29:43.325
Strange.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.953
Like I've slept for 100 years.

29:46.453 --> 29:47.496
CYRUS: What do you need?

29:47.579 --> 29:48.789
Is there anything we can do?

29:50.082 --> 29:51.708
Only one thing.

29:52.918 --> 29:54.086
Come here.

29:56.046 --> 30:02.469
Let me look at you.
My three brave, beautiful sons.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.806
And they moved heaven and earth
to bring you back.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.976
Bring me back?
From where? Where was I?

30:09.059 --> 30:10.978
You were badly burned.

30:11.061 --> 30:12.479
We didn't think you'd make it.

30:12.563 --> 30:13.564
AMARA: But I did.

30:14.523 --> 30:16.984
And yet I don't understand how.

30:17.276 --> 30:18.694
It was magic that saved you.

30:21.780 --> 30:22.823
Magic?

30:23.532 --> 30:24.741
From where?

30:25.492 --> 30:26.785
The Well of Wonders.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.412
We didn't have a choice.

30:28.871 --> 30:30.664
Tell me exactly what you did.

30:30.998 --> 30:32.499
We stole it, the water.

30:32.583 --> 30:33.876
(SIGHS) Cyrus, no.

30:33.959 --> 30:36.837
The guardian said that you
couldn't be saved, but look.

30:36.920 --> 30:37.921
You're healed!

30:38.005 --> 30:39.715
Did all three of you take the water?

30:40.799 --> 30:43.385
Then you need to leave...
all of you, right now.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.179
Leave? Wait. Why?

30:45.262 --> 30:47.306
Hurry. There isn't much time.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.724
It's the only way you'll be safe.

30:48.807 --> 30:49.892
Safe from what?

30:51.185 --> 30:52.769
She's coming for you.

30:55.272 --> 30:58.150
Whatever you do, don't stop
until you're out of Agrabah.

30:58.567 --> 31:01.069
If we're lucky, you'll be gone
before she realizes.

31:02.571 --> 31:03.947
We can't have her find you.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.870
I'm begging you. Have mercy.

31:34.853 --> 31:37.481
I'm sorry, <i>Maman. </i>Forgive me.

31:41.568 --> 31:42.653
No!

31:48.367 --> 31:49.826
Fascinating.

31:50.911 --> 31:52.037
Isn't it?

31:52.913 --> 31:55.832
On the outside, it's nothing special...

31:56.917 --> 31:59.711
nothing out of the ordinary.

31:59.795 --> 32:01.421
But inside...

32:01.505 --> 32:03.924
a prize more valuable than...

32:04.508 --> 32:05.759
gold?

32:05.843 --> 32:07.845
Just like that head of yours...

32:07.928 --> 32:10.806
Nothing particularly interesting
on the outside,

32:11.473 --> 32:13.475
but inside...

32:15.561 --> 32:17.813

32:18.146 --> 32:22.985
there's no telling what treasures
you've been hiding.

So...

32:25.279 --> 32:28.323
Let's find out, shall we?

Little pig, little pig,

You've already lived a life
of fear, haven't you?

32:54.349 --> 32:57.227
You believe that
if the Prince had chosen you

32:57.311 --> 32:59.271
instead of your stepsister, then...

33:00.230 --> 33:02.107
your mother would have loved you.

33:03.734 --> 33:07.696
And now you fear that love
is forever out of reach,

33:07.779 --> 33:11.700
and that deep, dark hole in your heart

33:11.783 --> 33:14.286
will remain empty...

that it's only a matter of time

before he knows, too.

Now that you're here,
we can leave this place together.

37:32.878 --> 37:35.589
And there must be a way
that I can open your...

37:35.672 --> 37:37.633
Why are you doing this?

37:39.092 --> 37:40.594
You're my Queen, Your Majesty.

37:40.677 --> 37:42.179
Not anymore.

37:43.096 --> 37:45.015
You have to warn Alice and Cyrus.

37:45.265 --> 37:48.018
Go to the Outlands, tell them it's over.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.395
Jafar has released the Jabberwocky.

37:50.479 --> 37:52.397
He has Will, he has all three bottles.

37:52.773 --> 37:55.567
Wonderland is doomed,
and I let that happen.

37:56.151 --> 37:58.820
Tell them they must get out of Wonderland
as fast as they can

37:58.904 --> 38:00.322
and to not look back.

38:02.241 --> 38:03.492
And what about you?

38:04.243 --> 38:05.827
Forget about me.

38:08.622 --> 38:11.041
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

38:14.920 --> 38:16.213
(RUSTLING)

38:20.509 --> 38:21.510
Alice.

38:21.593 --> 38:23.053
I thought you'd need some help.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.263
You followed me.

38:24.805 --> 38:26.306
How much did you see?

38:29.017 --> 38:30.394
Why didn't you tell me?

38:31.603 --> 38:32.729
Because...

38:34.314 --> 38:36.024
I was afraid I'd lose you.

38:36.692 --> 38:39.278
Everything that's happened here,
it's my fault...

38:39.987 --> 38:42.489
The curse, the bottles, Jafar,
all of your suffering.

38:42.573 --> 38:45.200
It's all punishment
for mistakes that I've made.

38:45.284 --> 38:48.203
Everybody has things
they wish they could take back.

38:48.287 --> 38:50.372
Everybody makes mistakes.

38:51.206 --> 38:52.457
Not you.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.464
I gave up on us.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.551
Before Will and the Rabbit
brought me to Wonderland,

39:02.926 --> 39:05.012
before they told me you were alive,

39:05.596 --> 39:09.183
I was in an asylum,
and I agreed to something...

39:09.433 --> 39:13.228
This procedure that would
erase my memory of this place...

39:13.979 --> 39:15.522
and of you...

39:15.856 --> 39:16.857
forever.

39:17.774 --> 39:20.360
I wanted to forget all about you...

39:21.236 --> 39:22.946
about all our adventures.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.449
I just had too much to remember.

39:28.619 --> 39:30.412
You fell in love with a genie, Alice.

39:30.495 --> 39:32.748
What if it's the bottle
that made me a better man?

39:32.831 --> 39:33.874
And now that I'm out...

39:33.957 --> 39:35.918
Then I'll be your bottle.

39:36.376 --> 39:39.630
Cyrus, if we live our lives
looking to the past,

39:39.713 --> 39:41.590
we'll never be able to move forward

39:41.673 --> 39:43.091
to our future together.

39:43.175 --> 39:44.176
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

39:44.259 --> 39:45.427
What is it?

39:47.554 --> 39:50.474
Someone once told me that
all things happen for a reason.

39:51.308 --> 39:53.227
I think I'm finally
starting to believe it.

39:54.144 --> 39:55.145
Come on.

39:55.229 --> 39:57.606
If your mother is indeed alive,
we need to find her.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.942
I think it's high time we met.

40:09.493 --> 40:11.912
You thought
I couldn't do this alone, Amara.

40:13.372 --> 40:15.123
How wrong you were.

40:15.791 --> 40:16.959
JABBERWOCKY: Was she?

40:17.584 --> 40:19.837
I seem to remember you calling upon me

40:19.920 --> 40:23.257
for some much-needed reinforcement.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.758
And I seem to remember

40:24.842 --> 40:27.135
removing that Vorpal Blade
from your gut...

40:27.970 --> 40:30.055
an action I can just as easily reverse.

40:34.768 --> 40:37.354
Soon, I'll have everything I ever wanted,

40:37.729 --> 40:39.898
and there's not a person
in this world...

40:40.607 --> 40:43.360
or any other...
that'll be able to stop me.

40:45.195 --> 40:47.155
(RUMBLING)

40:51.994 --> 40:53.161
(SIGHS)

40:53.245 --> 40:54.621
So...

40:54.997 --> 40:58.166
(RUMBLING CONTINUES)

40:59.042 --> 41:00.419
...let's begin.
