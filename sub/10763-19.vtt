WEBVTT

00:09.075 --> 00:12.012
Hey, you're up early.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.013
Rain wake you?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.314
Oh, I'm just
a little preoccupied.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.009
Well, if there's
something on your mind,

00:16.315 --> 00:17.317
you can tell me.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.309
It won't be long
before I'm your mom.

00:20.587 --> 00:23.351
I was actually going to tell you
before you said that.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.592
Aw... come on.

00:25.592 --> 00:29.195
Well, there's this woman
I can't seem to get off of my mind.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.219
A woman with a boyfriend.

00:30.730 --> 00:31.698
Hmm...

00:31.698 --> 00:33.266
Well, why don't you just
get her drunk

00:33.266 --> 00:35.234
and see what happens.

00:36.603 --> 00:39.071
You are nothing like my mother.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.410
Hey, Ronee,
better get dressed.

00:43.410 --> 00:44.677
You can't look like that
when she gets here.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.212
Oh, she's not coming
for another hour.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.201
Who?

00:47.380 --> 00:48.142
Ronee's mother.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.382
Your grandmother.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.284
Stop that.

00:51.284 --> 00:54.742
She's visiting with her
church group from Spokane.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.222
Yeah, and if
she sees me dressed like this,

00:56.222 --> 00:57.524
she'd know
I spent the night

00:57.524 --> 00:59.359
and then she'd be carping
about it the whole weekend.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.794
What, she doesn't approve
of premarital sex?

01:00.794 --> 01:03.126
Judging by the diving bell
she wore as a nightgown,

01:03.630 --> 01:05.530
she wasn't real big
on postmarital sex, either.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.270
Plus, I'm starting out
with one strike against me.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.139
Mother still remembers
a night he drove me home

01:13.139 --> 01:16.142
after baby-sitting you
and Niles, 30 years ago...

01:16.142 --> 01:17.243
40 years ago.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.812
I'm telling the story.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.815
I was all weepy because
this guy had just dumped me.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.806
And your father put his arm
around me just to be nice,

01:24.317 --> 01:25.819
and Mom saw it and she thought

01:25.819 --> 01:27.582
he was trying
to "rob me of my virtue. "

01:27.821 --> 01:29.422
Oh, that's crazy.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.119
I know, like there was
anything left to rob.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.427
Well, don't worry.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.129
It's been a long time
since I've had to charm

01:36.129 --> 01:37.430
the mother of one
of my girlfriends,

01:37.430 --> 01:38.798
but believe me,
it's a skill you don't lose.

01:38.798 --> 01:42.135
Dr. Crane?

01:42.135 --> 01:43.124
Oh, Mrs. Lawrence.

01:43.570 --> 01:44.637
How lovely
to see you again.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.127
Ronee should be here
any minute.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.507
Yes, well, I'm a little early.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.769
Yes, um, there'?
no problem.

01:49.209 --> 01:50.310
MRS. LA WRENCE:
I'm not inconveniencing you?

01:50.310 --> 01:51.311
FRASIER:
No, not at all.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.312
I could come back later.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.609
I wouldn't think of it
.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.206
Well, then
can I come in?

01:56.516 --> 01:57.517
Yes... yes, of course.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.506
Where are my manners?

01:59.219 --> 02:00.220
Oh, let me take
your coat.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.321
Martin?

02:01.321 --> 02:02.185
Hey, Ronee,
we were just...

02:03.289 --> 02:05.348
Wait... Mrs. Lawrence?

02:05.859 --> 02:08.794
Wow, you look wonderful.

02:08.794 --> 02:09.863
Ronee isn't here at the moment,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.353
so why don't I give you
a little tour.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.866
We can start
in the kitchen.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.367
Still all hands, I see.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.766
Oh, sorry.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.804
Well, Mrs. Lawrence,

02:17.804 --> 02:18.872
the kitchen's
right here.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.874
You know, you look
the same as you did

02:20.874 --> 02:21.774
the last time I saw you.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.209
What are you saying,

02:23.209 --> 02:24.699
that I looked
like this at 40?

02:31.551 --> 02:32.552
(doorbell ringing)

02:32.552 --> 02:33.541
I'll get it!

02:36.556 --> 02:39.548
Wait, it's pouring rain
outside. Here.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.367
Why, look who's here.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.164
It's Ronee!

02:54.741 --> 02:56.743
Hey, you two.
Hello. Hey, oh, Frasier,

02:56.743 --> 02:59.245
whatever plans you have
for this evening, cancel them.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.247
I am taking you
to a fantastic new restaurant.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.749
Well, all right.

03:02.749 --> 03:03.750
Where are we going?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.650
To Chez Paul? Kobu?

03:05.919 --> 03:07.216
Burger, Burger, Burger.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.223
Dear God, you're serious.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.524
I know what you're thinking.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.226
Not two days ago
I was just like you--

03:13.226 --> 03:15.228
too good to walk
into any one

03:15.228 --> 03:16.729
of their 7 1 convenient
locations.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.332
Then I dragged him
in there yesterday
for lunch

03:19.332 --> 03:21.823
when I was craving
a bacon cheeseburger-
burger-burger.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.825
He liked it so much,

03:24.337 --> 03:26.573
he insisted we try
The Chick'n Bucket
for dinner.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.541
I guess he's got
the fast-food bug.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.312
And which one would that be--
E. coli?

03:32.312 --> 03:33.613
Now, keep an open mind.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.316
After all, you've embraced
the peasant cuisine

03:36.316 --> 03:37.617
of Italy and France.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.586
Why shun the peasants
in our own backyard?

03:39.586 --> 03:41.287
You've changed, Niles.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.589
Oh, he hasn't changed that much.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.284
He sent back his Big Slurp.

03:44.591 --> 03:45.285
Good-bye, darling.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.581
Thanks, Niles,
but, you know,

03:47.293 --> 03:48.282
I think I'll pass.

03:48.595 --> 03:50.296
I'll spend the night in,
curled up with a good book.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.298
I didn't get
much sleep last night.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.299
So, Frasier,
what was going on

03:53.299 --> 03:54.288
with you at work today?

03:54.601 --> 03:55.295
You seemed
a little distracted.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.604
I'm not
really sure.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.607
t.
I can't stop thinking
about this woman I've me

04:00.607 --> 04:03.610
It's my matchmaker,
of all people.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.311
Well, now,
do you get a discount

04:05.311 --> 04:07.614
if the matchmakerIf?
sets you up with herse

04:07.614 --> 04:11.317
Sort of a...
floor model sort of thing?

04:11.317 --> 04:13.319
I thought you were
kind of ticked off at her.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.621
Well, I was
and then, um,

04:14.621 --> 04:18.625
we had dinner together
last night, and...

04:18.625 --> 04:20.616
Gosh, we were just so
comfortable with each other.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.329
It was like we'd
known each other for ages.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.631
So ask her out.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.333
Oh, I can't.
She's got a boyfriend.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.635
Truth be told,
I don't even know why

04:28.635 --> 04:30.637
I'm so obsessed with her.
I barely even know her.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.605
Niles, listen.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.675
Is it possible that this is just
a case of transference?

04:35.675 --> 04:37.677
Oh, interesting.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.680
Uh, a matchmaker
is not unlike a therapist.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.648
You, uh, confide in them
and seek guidance.

04:43.349 --> 04:46.352
It's only natural you'd devea
little crush on her.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.654
Yes, precisely.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.355
How many times has
a patient fallen for you?

04:49.355 --> 04:50.657
You first.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.352
Niles, please,
don't be such a baby.

04:52.659 --> 04:53.660
This is not a competition.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.360
Eleven.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.362
Thirteen.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.364
You know, this is really
a weight off of my shoulders.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.366
It's just simple transference.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.668
Thank you, Niles.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.369
Yes, well, I'm glad I could be of help.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.671
You know, when I said
1 1 earlier, actually...

05:04.671 --> 05:06.706
Too late, Niles.
Off you go.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.675
(chuckles)

05:08.675 --> 05:10.677
Well, that's
a relief.

05:10.677 --> 05:11.678
Frasier.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.680
Charlotte. Hi.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.681
Uh, good
to see you.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.672
I'd like you
to meet, uh...

05:17.684 --> 05:20.386
Roz, Frasier's producer.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.388
Hi.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.690
You know,
that was fun last night.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.679
Yes, it was.
We should do it again sometime.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.392
Oh, I'd love to.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.694
When I'm back in town.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.395
I'm going camping.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.396
I didn't realize you were
an outdoors woman.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.398
I'm not.

05:32.398 --> 05:33.387
Last time I camped out
was for Van Halen tickets.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.702
But, you know,
Frank loves it

05:35.702 --> 05:37.704
and I'll do
anything once.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.406
Oh, would you mind watering

05:40.406 --> 05:42.408
my office plants
while I'm away?

05:42.408 --> 05:43.710
I'd be glad to.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.411
Oh, gosh, you
are the best.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.412
Thanks.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.714
Um, anyone
need a refill?

05:47.714 --> 05:49.705
No, thanks.
No.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.710
Transference my ass.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.410
You've got it bad.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.413
All right,
what am I supposed to do?

05:59.759 --> 06:01.427
Well, fight for her.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.729
I mean, who
is this Frank guy?

06:02.729 --> 06:03.718
Oh, I don't know.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.432
Some kind of
environmental activist.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.434
That's
your competition?

06:08.434 --> 06:11.437
Some tree-hugging geek?
Come on.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.735
You're one of
the most eligible
bachelors in town...

06:14.440 --> 06:16.431
in your age range.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.747
Charlotte.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.749
Hi, honey.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.444
You're screwed.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.754
Frank,
this is Frasier,

06:27.754 --> 06:28.755
the one I was
telling you about.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.456
Hi. how
are you?

06:30.456 --> 06:31.457
And his
producer, Roz.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.458
Hi.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.527
So, I understand
you're going camping.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.425
Yeah, I raised some
eagle hatchlings

06:35.928 --> 06:37.430
when their mother
was killed by a hunter,

06:37.430 --> 06:39.432
and now we're going to go
release them in the wild.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.933
How can you tell
when it's time?

06:40.933 --> 06:44.437
Well, one of them
ate his landlord's cat.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.928
You know, if they're still hungry,
my dad has a dog.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.441
(laughing)

06:48.441 --> 06:49.442
You're funny.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.932
Well...

06:51.444 --> 06:52.945
I know a lady who would
love your sense of humor.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.447
She's a ranger
up on Mt. Rainier.

06:54.447 --> 06:55.715
She comes down every
couple months

06:55.715 --> 06:58.518
for supplies if you'd
like to meet her.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.486
Well, uh, thanks,
but, you know,

07:00.486 --> 07:01.817
I haven't had much luck

07:02.488 --> 07:04.479
with the women
of the Parks Department.

07:04.824 --> 07:05.813
(laughing)

07:07.000 --> 07:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:16.502 --> 07:18.504
Wow, Roz,
did you feel that?

07:18.504 --> 07:21.507
The entire room changed
when we walked in.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.498
It's like animals
in the wild

07:24.010 --> 07:26.512
sensing a predator
had arrived.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.503
Good. I like
that you're confident.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.004
No, I was talking
about you.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.520
Okay, now look,
this is the drill.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.523
I brought you here to get
your mind off Charlotte.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.525
Everyone's here
for the same reason.

07:39.525 --> 07:42.028
So just pick someone
and be yourself.

07:42.028 --> 07:45.031
Okay, um, what name
should I use?

07:45.031 --> 07:46.032
Excuse me.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.034
Another Cosmo, please.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.023
Buy that drink.

07:49.535 --> 07:50.536
Right,
a faint heart...

07:50.536 --> 07:52.038
Buy the drink.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.540
Barkeep, uh,
that one's on me.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.042
If you don't mind.

07:56.042 --> 08:00.035
Mind? Why do you think
I said it so loud?

08:01.047 --> 08:02.548
What do I do now?

08:02.548 --> 08:03.537
Just don't be
so nervous.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.551
And don't worry.
I won't leave you

08:05.551 --> 08:06.552
until you make
a connection.

08:06.552 --> 08:07.553
Hi.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.555
Or I do.

08:09.555 --> 08:12.558
Uh... hi.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.060
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.061
Kim.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.562
So, you're a doctor?

08:16.562 --> 08:18.064
Yes, I am.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.065
I have a small practice
here in town, and...

08:19.065 --> 08:20.566
Do you do collagen,

08:20.566 --> 08:24.070
because I could barter
frequent flyer miles.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.072
No, I'm not
that kind of doctor.

08:26.072 --> 08:27.061
.
I'm a psychiatrist

08:27.573 --> 08:29.075
Oh. Oh!

08:29.075 --> 08:32.078
You've probably got me
figured out already.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.578
No, no.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.581
I haven't even got you
on the couch yet.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.082
Oh, my God.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.072
Oh, I'm sorry. That was too aggressive.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.586
No, no, I had a fortune
cookie this morning

08:40.586 --> 08:42.587
that said I was going
to meet a doctor.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.580
I was afraid I was sick.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.594
Well, you look awfully
healthy to me.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.084
Oh, my God.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.097
Dear God, too
aggressive again?

08:51.097 --> 08:52.098
I'm sorry.
No.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.599
No, I love
this song.

08:53.599 --> 08:57.103
Come on, Dr. Frasier,
loosen up.

08:57.103 --> 09:02.108
I'm sorry. What's your
first name again?

09:02.108 --> 09:04.599
The first few
months I was a wreck.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.113
We were engaged.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.615
At least... I was.

09:09.615 --> 09:13.107
But now I know I'm
ready to move on.

09:13.619 --> 09:17.123
Really, really ready.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.624
You know, it's funny.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.626
I'm actually trying
to get over

09:20.626 --> 09:23.629
someone myself,
in a manner of speaking.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.632
And you thought she
was "the one, " right?

09:26.632 --> 09:27.621
She may have been,

09:28.134 --> 09:29.624
but I'm just trying to put her
out of my mind right now.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.638
I must say, you're proving to
a delightful distraction.

09:32.638 --> 09:35.641
Oh, well, that's not the nicest thing

09:35.641 --> 09:38.144
anybody's ever called
me in a bar,

09:38.144 --> 09:40.635
.
but it's not the worst

09:41.147 --> 09:42.148
This is fun,

09:42.148 --> 09:45.151
but I'm kind
of thinking that

09:45.151 --> 09:51.157
I'd like to go someplace a little less crowded.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.159
Okay, uh, well...
thank you.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.649
I enjoyed our time
together.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.653
No, I meant someplace
a little more private.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.666
No, I understand completely.
I take no offense.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.156
Your place.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.158
Oh, yes, yes, indeed.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.173
Well, should we go
together to my place...?

10:07.173 --> 10:08.674
Well, you must have
your own car,

10:08.674 --> 10:10.176
so I could
give you directions,

10:10.176 --> 10:11.666
or, uh, well, we could
drive together

10:12.178 --> 10:13.679
and then I could
drive you back here,

10:13.679 --> 10:15.181
or we could drive together

10:15.181 --> 10:16.671
and then you could
get a cab back here...

10:17.183 --> 10:19.185
I don't care
how we get there.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.676
Let's just get there.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.659
(doorbell rings)

10:37.970 --> 10:40.666
(music playing)

10:42.975 --> 10:44.340
It's unlocked.

10:44.744 --> 10:45.642
It's unsafe.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.134
Oh, dear God.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.849
Anyone could walk in.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.118
What the hell
are you two doing here?

10:52.118 --> 10:53.152
We came
to cheer you up

10:53.152 --> 10:54.854
with some
late-night fast food.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.155
If anything's gonna
make you forget a woman,

10:56.155 --> 10:57.156
it's a Big Double Juicy.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.024
Please take it.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.992
If you don't, he will.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.694
I've created a monster.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.996
He's already had
two chimichangas

11:03.996 --> 11:06.999
and a '"You Ain't Nothing
But a Corn Dog. "

11:06.999 --> 11:09.702
All for less
than four dollars.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.038
Where has this food
been all my life?

11:12.038 --> 11:14.774
On the end of a coroner'
s artery scraper.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.342
What the hell has
happened to you?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.878
You've devoted your whole life to
honing your standards

11:18.878 --> 11:21.313
only to succumb to the fast,
the cheap and the tasty.

11:21.313 --> 11:25.017
Sorry. I turned the wrong way

11:25.017 --> 11:26.786
coming out
of the elevator.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.913
Oh, hello.

11:30.890 --> 11:34.193
Kim, this is my brother Niles
and his wife Daphne.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.227
They were
just leaving.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.229
Charmed.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.732
Well, I see I have
my big Double Juicy

11:39.732 --> 11:40.733
and you have yours.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.034
Yes. Good night.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.697
Did somebody here
have a chimichanga?

11:45.838 --> 11:46.872
See? I told you.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.237
It's coming out
of your pores.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.705
Wow! Nice place.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.880
You really
are a doctor.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.383
Yes. Would you
like the tour?

11:57.383 --> 11:58.884
I don't know.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.387
What do you want
to show me?

12:01.387 --> 12:04.390
.
I don't know. Uh..

12:04.390 --> 12:07.393
What do
you want to see?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.895
What would you
like me to see?

12:09.895 --> 12:12.261
Whatever you
came here to see.

12:12.498 --> 12:16.736
And what did
I come here to see?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.037
Is there
an end to this?

12:18.037 --> 12:20.039
Because I...
I'm starting

12:20.039 --> 12:22.041
to feel redundant
on my part.

12:22.041 --> 12:26.045
Let's just
have some fun.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.912
You are delightfully
single-minded.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.307
Would you care
for some wine?

12:30.950 --> 12:31.939
Sounds great.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.253
We've both had
a rough time lately.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.256
How about we go
a little crazy tonight?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.958
I like
the sound of that.

12:38.958 --> 12:42.018
I've got a little outfit
you might like.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.499
The littler it is,
the more I like it.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.502
I love it when I say something

12:49.502 --> 12:52.494
and then you
say something funny.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.498
.
I'll tell you what

12:57.910 --> 12:59.445
If you'd like to,

12:59.445 --> 13:01.436
you can change
right in here,

13:01.947 --> 13:05.951
and maybe I'll whip up
a little surprise of my own.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.453
Okay.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.943
(squeaks)
Oh!

13:11.957 --> 13:13.459
When I met you tonight,

13:13.459 --> 13:17.828
I had no idea
what a bad boy you were.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.500
You know what bad
boys need, don't you?

13:21.500 --> 13:25.037
A spanking, right?

13:25.037 --> 13:26.539
..
That or.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.905
a good tongue-lashing.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.905
You did it again!

13:33.846 --> 13:35.848
Oh, my goodness!

13:35.848 --> 13:37.850
What's going on?

13:37.850 --> 13:40.853
I thought you were out
for the evening, for God's sake.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.154
We came back
for dessert.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.849
Obviously, you
got a jump on us.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.959
This is horrible.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.961
I... I'm so sorry.
I met, um...

13:48.961 --> 13:50.462
Kim.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.031
...Kim at a bar
earlier this evening

13:52.031 --> 13:53.965
and, obviously, we hit it off.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.391
Yeah, we get it.

13:55.868 --> 13:58.132
There's a little coffee shop
on the corner.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.472
Why don't we go
there for dessert?

14:00.472 --> 14:02.474
You may get away with this now,
young man,

14:02.474 --> 14:03.338
but once I'm your mother...

14:03.609 --> 14:04.200
Oh, get out!

14:09.048 --> 14:12.551
I would say,
"Perhaps another time, "

14:12.551 --> 14:14.653
but that
outfit goes

14:14.653 --> 14:17.122
a long way toward
recapturing the mood.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.625
Good. Now, why don't
you just relax,

14:19.625 --> 14:22.116
and I'll go find some ice
for our wines.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.120
(doorbell rings)

14:27.633 --> 14:28.622
Oh, good heavens!

14:30.135 --> 14:31.136
Hello.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.638
I'm sorry
to bother you.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.139
I just need
my house keys.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.130
I... I... I thought
you were camping.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.144
Uh... come on in.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.146
Gosh, I'm sorry about the stench in the hall.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.648
That would be me.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.150
I had a little run-in
with a skunk.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.517
I thought I could scare him off
if I threw my keys at him.

14:49.054 --> 14:49.955
Come on in.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.457
You really don't want me to.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.459
As it is now, I'm going
to have to sell my car.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.094
What is all over your chest?

14:55.094 --> 14:59.131
Okay, should
I...? Hello.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.497
Okay. Oh, I got it.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.466
Sorry. Charlotte,
this is Kim.

15:03.969 --> 15:04.958
Kim, this
is Charlotte.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.998
Boy, I've met more people
in this apartment

15:08.440 --> 15:09.942
than I did at the bar.

15:09.942 --> 15:13.445
I really didn't
mean to interrupt.

15:13.445 --> 15:15.936
If I could get my keys and use
your powder room really fast.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.950
Right.
It's right here.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.440
And I'll get those for you.

15:22.454 --> 15:23.455
Uh, Kim...

15:23.455 --> 15:25.946
I'm terribly sorry about this.

15:26.458 --> 15:30.462
I'm afraid it's just not going
to work out for us tonight.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.564
She's "the one, " isn't she?

15:32.564 --> 15:36.068
Yeah. Uh... Iisten.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.570
This has nothing to do with you,
you know.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.060
I've had a lovely time
this evening.

15:40.572 --> 15:41.561
Me, too.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.076
Maybe it's just as well.

15:44.076 --> 15:47.568
I'm... I'm
lactose intolerant.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.040
Good luck.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.560
Your keys.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.062
Thanks.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.051
Where's your friend?

16:04.563 --> 16:05.564
She left.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.066
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:07.066 --> 16:10.569
I didn't mean
to spoil your night.

16:10.569 --> 16:11.437
You didn't.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.699
Yes. Yes, I did.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.194
I spoil everything.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.708
Oh, now, don't go there.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.209
But it's true.

16:17.209 --> 16:19.211
No, no. I mean,
don't go there.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.713
Come sit over there.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.203
You'll be
more comfortable.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.718
I spoiled your evening,
I spoiled my clothes,

16:25.718 --> 16:28.420
I spoiled my
whole relationship.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.421
Oh?

16:29.421 --> 16:31.423
Frank and I had
a huge fight.

16:31.423 --> 16:34.126
,
He was getting impatient
with me because, excuse me

16:34.126 --> 16:37.129
I'm not exactly a pioneer woma
and I started snapping back.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.120
The whole thing
went downhill from there.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.133
I'm sure it wasn't as
bad as all that.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.261
I dropped the cooler
on one of the hatchlings.

16:45.004 --> 16:49.208
You know, maybe you
could use a little wine.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.607
I could,
but look at me.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.112
I can't stay in
your house like this.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.613
Okay, I tell you what.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.615
I have an eight-jet
whirlpool bath

16:56.615 --> 16:59.118
that you are free
to revive yourself in.

16:59.118 --> 17:02.621
I can get cleaned up
and make us some snacks.

17:02.621 --> 17:04.123
All right? And, uh...

17:04.123 --> 17:07.659
You know, actually, I have
an endangered condor pte

17:07.659 --> 17:10.662
that I've been saving
for just such an occasion.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.153
It's not funny.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.636
More wine?

17:17.636 --> 17:19.104
Thanks.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.571
This is my idea
of camping.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.567
I'm not much of
an outdoor man myself.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.817
In college,
I got lost on a nature hike.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.319
After screaming for 45 minutes,

17:34.319 --> 17:37.322
I was finally rescued
by a Brownie troop.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.311
(laughing)

17:38.824 --> 17:40.325
I still know
some of their songs.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.493
(laughing)

17:41.493 --> 17:43.195
I still can't believe

17:43.195 --> 17:46.221
I haven't found the right woma
for you yet.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.100
Well, there's no rush.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.436
I'm enjoying the search.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.165
You're so sweet.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.262
You're sweet yourself.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.134
Charlotte...

18:01.447 --> 18:03.148
I hope
you won't think

18:03.148 --> 18:05.343
this is too forward
of me, but...

18:05.584 --> 18:09.455
A promising relationship
doesn't come along very often,

18:09.455 --> 18:13.152
and when it does, it's worth
sticking your neck out for.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.218
What I'm saying is...

18:19.598 --> 18:21.100
Good Lord!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.601
He's with another one!

18:22.601 --> 18:24.103
For heaven's sake!

18:24.103 --> 18:26.105
What are you doing
to me, boy?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.597
Maybe I'll just go get
those sweats you offered
and get out of here.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.100
All right, Veronica,
we've had dessert.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.613
We've dropped him off.
Can we go now?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.115
No.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.118
I don't want to spend
another moment in this house.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.420
Well, fine, then, you
go, but I am staying
here with Marty.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.422
Oh, oh, sure,
okay, uh, Ronee,

18:43.422 --> 18:45.124
I'll just make up
the couch for you.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.425
Just drop it, Marty.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.518
Yes, Mother,
we are sleeping together.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.295
And he's not the first...

18:50.295 --> 18:51.663
or the second.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.665
In fact, I'm well
into double digits now.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.834
Okay, we got
the picture.
Look, I...

18:55.834 --> 18:57.836
.
I'm sorry. I-I know
you're upset, but I just..

18:57.836 --> 18:58.837
I can't live a lie anymore.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.828
For God's sakes,
I'm in my 40s.

19:01.340 --> 19:01.829
What are
you talking about?

19:02.341 --> 19:03.342
You haven't been
in your 40s...

19:03.342 --> 19:04.832
All right, good
night, Mother.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.779
I'll see you
in the morning.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.770
Well, if you're a good boy
, maybe you'll get

19:10.282 --> 19:11.772
to spend the summer
with your grandma.

19:20.459 --> 19:23.462
Thanks for the sweats.

19:23.462 --> 19:27.166
And about before...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.828
I think I know
what you were trying to say.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.173
You do?
Yes.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.676
A promising relationship
is worth fighting for.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.179
So I called Frank
and apologized,

19:40.179 --> 19:41.942
and he's on his way home.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.940
Thank you for being there
for me tonight.

19:47.819 --> 19:50.310
You are such a good friend.

19:51.823 --> 19:55.327
So, uh...
I'll see you Monday?

19:55.327 --> 19:56.828
Maybe we can get
some coffee?

19:56.828 --> 19:58.295
Right.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.667
(door shuts)

20:01.667 --> 20:04.369
I brought a little dessert back.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.532
.
I don't suppose
there's any whipped cream left

20:09.341 --> 20:11.332
Sorry. No.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.837
You all right?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.550
No.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.486
Want to talk about it?

20:21.486 --> 20:24.978
Whoo! I got to get
this chair cleaned.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.895
She doesn't want me.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.362
She wants somebody else.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.229
I don't have a chance.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.393
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.304
That's the second one, right?

20:39.304 --> 20:40.396
Yeah.

20:42.441 --> 20:43.999
So, uh, what
are you going to do?

20:44.443 --> 20:45.432
Oh, that's a good question.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.746
What am I going to do?

20:47.746 --> 20:51.016
I suppose I could pine over her
for the next several weeks,

20:51.016 --> 20:54.353
make myself more miserable
every day...

20:54.353 --> 20:58.590
or I could do the sensible thing
and just...

20:58.590 --> 20:59.887
Iet her go.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.258
Excuse me.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.474
Hi, Charlotte.
It's Frasier.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.413
Um...

21:21.413 --> 21:24.314
about coffee on Monday--
let's just forget that.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.318
How about lunch instead?

21:30.305 --> 21:36.438
