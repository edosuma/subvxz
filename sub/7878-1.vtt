Tonight, in honor of the 100th
<i>episode of</i> American Dad,

00:04.994 --> 00:07.463
<i>tragedy will strike</i>
<i>Langley Falls with death...</i>

00:08.798 --> 00:10.799
<i>100 times.</i>

<i>That's right,</i>
<i>100 of the characters</i>

00:12.802 --> 00:14.903
<i>you've come to know</i>
<i>and love will die.</i>

00:22.412 --> 00:24.546
For Pete sakes, these things
are going to kill me.

00:25.949 --> 00:27.950
But not tonight!

00:28.017 --> 00:32.054
No, tonight we're going to find
out who shot Mr. Burns.

00:32.122 --> 00:34.556
What? 15 years ago?

00:34.624 --> 00:35.891
Who was it?

00:35.959 --> 00:37.826
Really? The baby?

00:37.894 --> 00:39.362
I want a baby.

00:55.912 --> 00:58.380
I'm gonna shoot him
in the throat.

00:58.448 --> 01:00.015
Stan, wait!

01:00.083 --> 01:01.316
I want to watch.

01:03.253 --> 01:05.154
Stop it,
you guys.

01:05.221 --> 01:07.623
Look, I told Jeff
I'm not ready to date
anyone right now.

01:07.690 --> 01:09.324
So you don't have
to worry about him.

01:09.392 --> 01:10.425
Good.

01:10.493 --> 01:12.561
Look at him-- he still
rocks a goatee.

01:12.629 --> 01:13.795
Poser-ass bitch.

01:13.863 --> 01:15.697
Look, he's a sweet guy.

01:15.765 --> 01:17.566
He's just a little lost
right now.

01:17.634 --> 01:19.101
Hayley, you don't know
what you're talking about.

01:19.169 --> 01:21.069
You have terrible judgment.

01:21.137 --> 01:23.939
The one time we let you
order pizza, you ordered
no sauce, extra olives.

01:24.007 --> 01:26.008
I was so astounded
I took a picture of it.

01:26.075 --> 01:27.676
No, that's not it--
that's a picture

01:27.744 --> 01:29.845
of when I met Loni
Anderson at the airport.

01:34.384 --> 01:36.051
Next on HBO:

01:36.119 --> 01:38.487
Tracy Ullman performs
her ethnic favorites.

01:40.023 --> 01:41.223
Change the channel. Hurry!

01:41.291 --> 01:42.791
Where's the remote?

01:42.859 --> 01:44.793
ULLMAN
15 doughnuts, <i>por favor.</i>

01:44.861 --> 01:46.428
Change it!

01:46.496 --> 01:48.096
I can't find it!

01:48.164 --> 01:50.632
I'm so sleepy.

01:52.869 --> 01:54.303
It's okay.

01:54.370 --> 01:55.704
It can't hurt us now.

01:55.772 --> 01:57.940
Hey, Roger, a missing remote.

01:58.007 --> 01:59.775
Sounds like another
case for...

01:59.842 --> 02:01.777
Wheels and The Leg Man.
Wheels and The Leg Man.

02:08.685 --> 02:09.785
Enough!

02:09.852 --> 02:11.320
What the hell's
your problem?

02:11.387 --> 02:14.122
Every <i>Wheels and The Legman</i>
is the same.

02:14.190 --> 02:16.291
You pick some boring case,
you bicker,

02:16.359 --> 02:17.759
then you solve it.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.761
The solution usually being
that Roger is the culprit.

02:19.829 --> 02:22.030
It's true. I've got
the remote right here.

02:24.634 --> 02:29.471
♪ Cheek to cheek,
and hole to hole... ♪

02:29.539 --> 02:32.307

02:37.714 --> 02:40.649
Go on, Jeff, shoo, shoo, scat.

02:40.717 --> 02:42.551
Jeff, you're not
good enough for
our daughter.

02:42.619 --> 02:44.853
You have no job,
no home and no future.

02:44.921 --> 02:46.455
Plus, you're always
wiping your face.

02:46.522 --> 02:47.789
No, I'm not.

02:54.464 --> 02:56.331
Helado?

02:56.399 --> 02:59.868
Why nobody buy my helado?

03:05.608 --> 03:08.710
So guess who got put on
chauffeur duty again?

03:08.778 --> 03:11.513
I did not join the CIA
for this.

03:11.581 --> 03:14.549
Anyway, Mama, I'm not gonna
make home for Randy's birthday.

03:14.617 --> 03:16.985
Just kick him in his fat ass
for me 29 times.

03:18.688 --> 03:20.022
Yes, sir?

03:20.089 --> 03:22.491
Reginald, this isn't the way
I usually drive to work.

03:22.558 --> 03:24.059
Look, you may got
me driving you,

03:24.127 --> 03:25.460
but I'm gonna
take my route.

03:25.528 --> 03:28.397
Does your route include
the attitude store

03:28.464 --> 03:31.366
where we could stop and
get you a new attitude?

03:36.506 --> 03:38.373
Now what is this mess?

03:42.578 --> 03:45.280
Whoa, you got a limo.

03:45.348 --> 03:46.815
Are you rich?

03:46.883 --> 03:48.216
Yeah, Jeff, I'm rich.

03:48.284 --> 03:49.885
I'm a millionaire.

03:49.952 --> 03:52.120
So I wear this stupid hat
and drive this long bitch.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.522
Hayley won't talk to me.

03:53.589 --> 03:55.190
I've tried everything.

03:55.258 --> 03:57.092
Look, man, Hayley
broke my heart too,

03:57.160 --> 03:59.328
but the girl told us both
she needs some space.

03:59.395 --> 04:00.862
You should do what I'm doing--

04:00.930 --> 04:02.331
start casually dating
other women.

04:02.398 --> 04:04.066
I'm seeing a fine bitch
right now--

04:04.133 --> 04:05.934
works at Chik-fil-A
down by the airport.

04:06.002 --> 04:07.736
Got grease burns
all over her arms.

04:07.804 --> 04:09.471
Am I gonna marry her?
Hell, no!

04:09.539 --> 04:11.206
But she don't need to know that.

04:11.274 --> 04:15.277
Um, all right, I guess
I could give Hayley her space.

04:15.345 --> 04:16.577
My man.

04:16.646 --> 04:17.879
Now go take a shower.

04:17.947 --> 04:19.748
You smell like cheap weed
and apple sauce.

04:19.815 --> 04:22.384
Cheap weed and apple sauce.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.252
Okay, how about
this for a case?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.088
Wheel's ex comes to town

04:26.155 --> 04:28.223
looking for whoever
poisoned her race horse.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.292
Uh, yeah...

04:30.360 --> 04:33.895
Hey, what if I'm visited
by the ghost of my dead father

04:33.963 --> 04:35.964
who also used to be a detective?

04:36.032 --> 04:38.800
So we're just saying the first
thing that comes into our minds?

04:38.868 --> 04:40.168
Okay, tickle monster.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.871
I know, Dad-- I have
to deal with this

04:42.939 --> 04:44.439
every day at the agency.

04:44.507 --> 04:45.874
Your ghost father
is not here!

04:45.942 --> 04:47.943
Oh, no? Then who's...

04:48.010 --> 04:50.245
possessing me?

04:52.181 --> 04:53.515
Stop it. Stop it, Wheels.

04:53.583 --> 04:54.850
Stop it... Wheels...

04:54.917 --> 04:56.618
Stop it, Wheel's father!

05:02.525 --> 05:03.625
Hayley.

05:03.693 --> 05:04.926
Jeff, what are
you doing here?

05:04.994 --> 05:06.094
Look...

05:06.162 --> 05:08.497
Hey, who solved
my theorem?!

05:08.564 --> 05:10.098
Which one of you
is the genius?

05:10.166 --> 05:11.166
You there.

05:14.470 --> 05:16.004
Jeff, I thought
I told you...

05:16.072 --> 05:17.906
I know you don't
want to see me,

05:17.974 --> 05:19.541
but I need to tell
you something.

05:19.609 --> 05:23.578
And then, if you want,
I'll leave you alone forever.

05:26.582 --> 05:29.718
Thank God we got rid of Jeff
and that old hippie.

05:29.786 --> 05:32.521
The stench of pot and body odor
was beginning to reach

05:32.588 --> 05:34.089
h McConnaughey-vian proportions.

05:34.157 --> 05:35.390
What's this note
from Hayley?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.192
<i>Dear, Mom and Dad,</i>

05:37.260 --> 05:39.795
<i>I realized I'm still in love</i>
<i>with Jeff Fisher.</i>

05:39.862 --> 05:41.763
<i>I know you hate his guts,</i>

05:41.831 --> 05:43.331
<i>which is why we've decided</i>
<i>to elope.</i>

06:12.228 --> 06:13.462
Stan?

06:15.698 --> 06:17.666
Did I... Did I turn back time?

06:17.733 --> 06:20.769
No. You fainted and bashed
your head on the counter.

06:20.837 --> 06:23.405
I'm-I'm pretty sure
I turned back time.

06:23.473 --> 06:26.641
You must be Francine's
grandmother.

06:26.709 --> 06:29.010
One day, your granddaughter

06:29.078 --> 06:32.481
will make me a
moderately happy man.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.681
I I can't believe Haley
ran off with that idiot.

06:39.749 --> 06:41.750
The kids are going
to be half loser.

06:41.818 --> 06:42.985
I'll hate my grandchildren.

06:43.052 --> 06:44.386
And I'm gonna tell 'em.

06:44.454 --> 06:45.821
I'm going to look them

06:45.888 --> 06:47.489
straight in the eye and say,
"Pop-Pop hates you."

06:47.557 --> 06:50.926
Says here they're getting
married tonight at sunset.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.761
We'll never be able
to stop them.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.363
We have no idea
where they went.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.098
Oh, <i>we</i> have no idea?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.467
Just like <i>we</i> want to have
a weekend in Santa Fe?

06:58.534 --> 07:01.903
You. You have no idea.

07:01.971 --> 07:05.140
You want to go
to Santa Fe.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.910
I had tracking chips implanted
in the base of the kids' skulls

07:08.978 --> 07:10.312
when they were born.

07:10.380 --> 07:12.447
Hayley's heading north.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.116
She's only 40 minutes away.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.517
Let's go.
Which way is north?

07:15.585 --> 07:17.185
That way.

07:17.253 --> 07:19.154
It's a dead end.

07:19.222 --> 07:21.623
Whoo!
We're getting married!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.859
I'm so glad you said yes.

07:23.926 --> 07:26.928
When you proposed, it's like
my heart started up again.

07:26.996 --> 07:29.131
I feel so close
to you, you know.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.932
Like we're brother
and sister.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.201
Like you're my mom,
but with benefits.

07:33.269 --> 07:34.936
This is so exciting.

07:35.004 --> 07:36.905
We're starting
our lives together.

07:36.973 --> 07:38.140
So what's our plan?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.142
Oh, I got it all figured out.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.078
As soon as we're married, we're
gonna move to rural Mexico

07:43.146 --> 07:44.880
and produce a cartoon
about crickets

07:44.947 --> 07:46.581
that don't like to eat
their vegetables.

07:46.649 --> 07:49.051
Really? That's your plan?

07:49.118 --> 07:51.320
Yeah. I already wrote
the pilot script.

07:53.122 --> 07:55.324
Will you read it
and give me notes?

07:55.391 --> 07:59.795
I'm especially interested
in any areas that come
off too pornographic.

08:02.865 --> 08:06.401
Stan, Hayley's dot hasn't
moved in the last 20 minutes.

08:06.469 --> 08:08.270
What could she be doing?

08:08.338 --> 08:10.772
Oh, God! You don't
think she's having sex?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.475
No, if her body temperature
rises, the dot turns purple.

08:13.543 --> 08:15.177
I paid extra
for that option.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.546
I can also explode
her breasts at any time.

08:17.613 --> 08:19.181
Good.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.116
She should be
up here to the right.

08:24.354 --> 08:25.921
They must be
in the bathroom.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.291
It turned purple!
What?!

08:32.729 --> 08:33.729
I don't get it.

08:33.796 --> 08:34.929
Where's Hayley?

08:34.996 --> 08:36.698
She must have ripped out
her tracking device

08:36.765 --> 08:38.299
and fed it to one
of these dogs.

08:38.368 --> 08:39.534
Which one?

08:40.635 --> 08:42.136
That one.

08:42.205 --> 08:44.873
Well, I was able
to reattach his legs.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.174
I think he's gonna make it.

08:46.242 --> 08:47.676
Oh, thank God.

08:51.214 --> 08:54.116
Stan, my credit card
is missing.

08:55.184 --> 08:56.785
Hayley must have taken it.

08:56.853 --> 08:59.020
Where's this scarf come from?

09:00.156 --> 09:03.425
Oh, that was the liner
of my purse.

09:06.028 --> 09:07.396
Okay, thanks.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.664
The last charge
was ten minutes ago

09:09.732 --> 09:11.266
at the Nut and Jerky House

09:11.334 --> 09:13.135
at the base of the
Chimdale Mountains.

09:13.202 --> 09:14.569
That mountain range
is enormous.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.838
We'll never find them in
time to stop the wedding.

09:16.906 --> 09:20.909
We scrimped and sacrificed
to save $50,000

09:20.977 --> 09:22.911
to give that girl
a beautiful wedding.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.147
And now that
money's just gone.

09:25.214 --> 09:27.115
No, Francine, we
still have the money.

09:27.183 --> 09:28.583
We didn't have the wedding.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.685
No, but, Stan, she...

09:30.753 --> 09:32.220
Oh.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.657
We good, champ?
We work that out?

09:35.725 --> 09:38.026
'Cause I have an idea
how we can use that money.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.365
We have breaking
news to report.

09:43.433 --> 09:46.501
We go now to local
man Stan Smith, live
via satellite phone.

09:46.569 --> 09:47.502
Hello?

09:47.570 --> 09:48.904
Yes, Stan, go ahead.

09:48.971 --> 09:51.706
Four hours ago, my daughter,
Hayley Smith eloped

09:51.774 --> 09:53.942
with the notorious slacker
Jeff Fisher.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.012
I'm offering
$50,000 to anyone

09:57.079 --> 09:58.180
who can stop
the wedding.

09:58.247 --> 09:59.614
They're getting married

09:59.682 --> 10:01.016
somewhere in
the Chimdale Mountains.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.685
Again, that reward
is 50 grand,

10:03.753 --> 10:06.254
to anyone who can
stop the wedding

10:06.322 --> 10:08.256
of Hayley Smith
and Jeff Fisher.

10:08.324 --> 10:10.192
Oh, hell no.

10:10.259 --> 10:11.993
That slippery-ass hippie.

10:12.061 --> 10:13.462
I gotta stop this.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.831
I gotta show Hayley
I'm still in the game.

10:15.898 --> 10:18.400
I'm going to call my man
at Jewelry Galleria.

10:18.468 --> 10:20.435
Yo, Doug, I need a diamond.

10:20.503 --> 10:22.938
Doesn't have to be big,
but make it flawless.

10:23.005 --> 10:24.473
That's friend price?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.241
You let me down, Doug.

10:26.309 --> 10:27.742
I'm gonna call NYC.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.211
I'm gonna get
my Hebrews on this.

10:33.149 --> 10:35.217
Let's go get that
money, people.

10:37.186 --> 10:39.354
Yeah!

10:52.201 --> 10:55.303
Here we are,
the honeymoon suite.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.242
Oh, fancy.

11:00.309 --> 11:01.543
Chocolate on the pillow.

11:01.611 --> 11:04.613
Hey, come back, chocolate.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.349
Look, I'm sorry
about the room, babe.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.918
I just don't have a lot
of scratch right now.

11:09.986 --> 11:11.820
But once we get
to Mexico...

11:11.888 --> 11:13.755
Jeff, I don't want
to go to Mexico, okay?

11:13.823 --> 11:15.223
That's <i>your</i> plan.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.492
We need a plan we can <i>both</i>
be excited about.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.395
A new plan...

11:20.463 --> 11:21.997
New Mexico!

11:22.064 --> 11:24.199
I need
to take a walk.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.436
Knock-knock.
Hotel manager.

11:28.504 --> 11:29.671
Sorry to intrude,

11:29.739 --> 11:31.706
but you got
the only working toilet.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.543
You might want to turn
the TV up pretty loud.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.811
I ate an artichoke
today.

11:40.016 --> 11:41.283
Were you the one

11:41.350 --> 11:43.251
who wanted to schedule
an ATV ride?

11:44.854 --> 11:48.657
...a $50,000 reward to anyone
who can stop the marriage.

11:48.724 --> 11:50.091
The girl has been described

11:50.159 --> 11:52.060
as a likely
Women's Studies major

11:52.128 --> 11:53.728
and probable roller derby
captain,

11:53.796 --> 11:56.498
while the male is your classic
run-of-the-mill stoner.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.429
Here's an artist rendering
of the couple.

12:00.098 --> 12:01.432
Zoinks!

12:04.303 --> 12:06.203
Only a couple of hours
until sunset.

12:06.271 --> 12:09.173
I pray someone finds them
before it's too late.

12:09.241 --> 12:12.076
Oh, look!
It's Principal Lewis!

12:13.378 --> 12:15.780
Hi, Principal Lewis!

12:15.847 --> 12:17.148
What the hell?!

12:17.215 --> 12:18.716
I'm getting to those kids first!

12:18.784 --> 12:20.017
I need that money!

12:20.085 --> 12:23.120
I'm not going back
to that school!

12:24.723 --> 12:25.990
y'all!

12:26.058 --> 12:27.491
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:27.559 --> 12:28.793
People are excited!

12:42.874 --> 12:44.642
Reginald, are we at
the CIA yet?

12:44.710 --> 12:45.876
Change of plans.

12:45.944 --> 12:47.678
I'm going after
the woman of my dreams:

12:47.746 --> 12:49.046
Hayley Smith.

12:49.114 --> 12:50.748
Hayley Smith?!

12:50.816 --> 12:53.951
Oh, I had a thing
with her one summer.

12:54.019 --> 12:55.720
What? You and Hayley
had a thing?

12:55.787 --> 12:57.655
A thing?

12:57.723 --> 12:59.156
That's a polite way
of saying

12:59.224 --> 13:01.525
I tapped her
like a pony keg.

13:01.593 --> 13:02.960
Banged her around
so much,

13:03.028 --> 13:04.462
I lost my deposit.

13:04.529 --> 13:05.930
Sir, I would
appreciate it

13:05.997 --> 13:06.997
if you could refrain

13:07.065 --> 13:08.599
from any sexual
reminiscing

13:08.667 --> 13:10.701
regarding Hayley
whilst we take our
little detour.

13:10.769 --> 13:13.404
Ah, I took a detour
on Hayley.

13:13.472 --> 13:17.108
Got lost in the brush
and went down a dirt road.

13:19.111 --> 13:20.578
What's all this now?

13:20.645 --> 13:21.946
Why are we stopping?

13:22.013 --> 13:24.315
You and I are gonna
fight in a field.

13:27.886 --> 13:29.387
♪ Ah-na-na way ♪

13:29.454 --> 13:31.322
♪ Ah-na-na-way,
na-na! ♪

13:31.390 --> 13:32.556
What are you doing?

13:32.624 --> 13:33.791
Capoeira, bitch!

13:33.859 --> 13:35.192
That's Brazilian
dance-fighting.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.327
I'm trained!

13:38.764 --> 13:41.165
Oh, I guess we started.

13:43.602 --> 13:45.770
My gentleman's blouse!

13:50.675 --> 13:52.777
Finding Hayley
for the reward money.

13:52.844 --> 13:54.245
Now that's a real case.

13:54.312 --> 13:56.046
All right, I got
everything we need:

13:56.114 --> 13:57.314
chocolate milk,
cheese puffs

13:57.382 --> 13:58.649
and some Turkish
amphetamines

13:58.717 --> 13:59.984
I scored in
the bathroom.

14:00.051 --> 14:01.318
Whoa, whoa, Legs!

14:01.386 --> 14:02.753
You sure that's
a good idea?

14:02.821 --> 14:05.756
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

14:05.824 --> 14:07.625
See? Everything
in moderation.

14:07.692 --> 14:10.795
Now I'm gonna have
five cheese puffs, no more.

14:12.464 --> 14:14.799
Legs, please,
just-just pull over!

14:14.866 --> 14:16.367
Why are you calling me "Legs"?

14:16.435 --> 14:17.802
Is there something wrong
with my legs?

14:17.869 --> 14:19.437
Is that why, is that why

14:19.504 --> 14:20.938
there's a wheelchair
in the car?!

14:21.006 --> 14:23.707
What did you do to my legs,
you Nazi walrus bastard?!

14:23.775 --> 14:25.476
Steve, who is he
talking to?

14:25.544 --> 14:26.844
Shut up, Garfield!

14:26.912 --> 14:29.113
Why-Why, why do you,
why do you hate Mondays?!

14:29.181 --> 14:30.481
You don't even work!

14:30.549 --> 14:33.484
Officer, please,
I'm an educator.

14:33.552 --> 14:35.019
I'm a molder
of young minds.

14:35.086 --> 14:36.187
Shoulder jam!

14:40.025 --> 14:44.528
Brother's in the front seat
this time !

14:45.931 --> 14:47.798
$50,000.

14:47.866 --> 14:50.000
I'm gonna miss you, money.

14:50.068 --> 14:51.635
Not you, briefcase.

14:51.703 --> 14:54.405
Stan, are we doing
the right thing?

14:54.473 --> 14:57.174
What if Hayley hates us
for doing this?

14:57.242 --> 14:58.275
Hates us?

14:58.343 --> 14:59.343
We're saving her

14:59.411 --> 15:00.578
from making
a huge mistake.

15:00.645 --> 15:01.946
She'll probably thank us
one day.

15:02.013 --> 15:03.781
Like I thanked that woman
who talked me out

15:03.849 --> 15:04.849
of sleeping with her

15:04.916 --> 15:06.317
on that business trip
last spring.

15:06.384 --> 15:08.586
She was right.
It would have been
a huge mistake.

15:08.653 --> 15:10.554
I just couldn't
see that at the time.

15:10.622 --> 15:12.490
God, she had
the prettiest eyes!

15:12.557 --> 15:15.092
I shoulda done it.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.127
I shoulda.

15:17.195 --> 15:18.696
Hello.

15:18.763 --> 15:20.097
Hey, Mr. S.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.131
It's Jeff!

15:21.199 --> 15:24.068
Hey, Jeff!

15:24.135 --> 15:27.404
I know you're offering 50 grand
to anyone who stops the wedding.

15:27.472 --> 15:28.272
Uh...

15:28.340 --> 15:29.607
What if I agreed

15:29.674 --> 15:31.308
to not marry your daughter?

15:31.376 --> 15:32.476
Would you give me the money?

15:39.518 --> 15:42.520
I played Stan's
satanic best friend

15:42.587 --> 15:44.955
in episode 302.

15:59.472 --> 16:01.240
Dumping Hayley
for the reward money!

16:01.327 --> 16:02.894
That son of
a bitch hippie!

16:02.961 --> 16:04.462
Francine, this is
a good thing.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.230
We'll just give Jeff
the 50 grand

16:06.298 --> 16:07.632
and be rid of him
forever!

16:14.406 --> 16:15.473
You piece of .

16:15.541 --> 16:16.974
Francine, please.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.176
You're gonna break

16:18.243 --> 16:20.578
my daughter's heart
for $50,000?!

16:20.646 --> 16:21.679
Francine!

16:21.747 --> 16:23.114
You're too angry
right now.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.716
Go buy some nuts
and jerky.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.218
You're buying my wife
some nuts and jerky.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.986
I'm gonna buy
some nuts and jerky,

16:29.054 --> 16:30.388
you piece of .

16:33.425 --> 16:35.526
Whoa! Hundred-dollar bills.

16:35.594 --> 16:38.863
Hello, President Shakespeare.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.466
You'll find Hayley at the
Chimdale Mountain Inn.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.601
We were right about you
all along.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.069
I'm sorry, Mr. S.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.305
Your daughter and I have
just been fighting a lot,

16:47.373 --> 16:49.607
and I'm not sure
she's awesome.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.175
Just say the word.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.710
Don't do it,
Francine!

16:52.778 --> 16:54.245
All I heard was,
"Do it."

16:56.181 --> 16:59.350
Honey,
it's not loaded.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.086
Ow.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.172
Seh-seh-seh!

17:23.409 --> 17:25.609
All right,
enough of this.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.754
Are you ready
to apologize?

17:36.822 --> 17:41.325
I apologize to the maids
at the Red Roof Inn

17:41.393 --> 17:47.165
who have to clean
the curtains

17:47.232 --> 17:49.100
and you just said
all that.

17:49.168 --> 17:52.203
I'm gonna call your mama
and tell her what you said.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.906
Don't!

17:54.973 --> 17:56.140
That money's mine!

17:56.208 --> 17:57.308
MAN 2:
I saw her first!

17:57.376 --> 17:58.709
Leave me alone!

17:58.777 --> 18:00.578
Fireman chop!

18:00.646 --> 18:03.648
Come here,
you valuable shiksa!

18:06.318 --> 18:07.552
Fumble!

18:14.526 --> 18:16.494
Hey!

18:22.734 --> 18:26.571
Spring break, yeah!

18:26.638 --> 18:28.406
Yeah!

18:28.474 --> 18:29.607
Stop, all of you!

18:29.675 --> 18:31.008
The reward has been claimed!

18:31.076 --> 18:32.043
Who claimed it?

18:32.110 --> 18:33.678
The hippie Jeff Fisher.

18:33.745 --> 18:34.979
Really?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.247
The NFL coach?
Probably.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.448
I thought he
was dead.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.016
Wha... What are you
talking about?

18:39.084 --> 18:41.385
He took the money, Hayley.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.487
He's no good.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.656
That's... not possible.

18:45.724 --> 18:46.824
I'm sorry, honey,

18:46.892 --> 18:48.526
but it's better you
find out now.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.228
I guess you guys
were right.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.729
I'll get my stuff,

18:51.797 --> 18:54.232
and then we can go home.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.169
Bitch, what are you
crying about?!

18:58.237 --> 18:59.704
I was counting on that money.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.272
I can't go back to work now!

19:01.340 --> 19:02.874
I took a deuce on my desk!

19:04.510 --> 19:06.577
y'all!

19:10.449 --> 19:11.716
That was quite
a ride, Wheels,

19:11.783 --> 19:13.317
but I think
I got us there.

19:13.385 --> 19:16.687
Hey, I see Hayley!

19:16.755 --> 19:19.123
Don't marry Jeff!

19:19.191 --> 19:21.893
Case closed.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.231
How much packing
does she have to do?

19:27.299 --> 19:28.232
It's been 45 minutes.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.333
You saw her face

19:29.401 --> 19:31.168
when she found out
Jeff bailed on her.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.603
She's devastated!

19:32.671 --> 19:35.072
She looked like
she wanted to die.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.308
Wait... You don't
think she'd...?

19:39.778 --> 19:41.412
Oh, my God!
Hayley!

19:45.484 --> 19:46.484
Oh, it's okay.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.386
It's just the hotel manager.

19:48.453 --> 19:51.556
"Surprise. Jeff and I were
in on it together.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.324
"We stole your money
and eloped,

19:53.392 --> 19:55.226
"this time in style.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.262
"By the way, it was
my loser husband's idea.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.165
Yours truly,
Mrs. Jeff Fisher."

20:01.233 --> 20:03.367
That's a weird
suicide note.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.970
No, this is from Hayley.
The suicide note's on the back.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.040
"I'm so sorry for
all the horrible
things I've done.

20:09.107 --> 20:10.841
You'll find the severed
penises underneath..."

20:10.909 --> 20:12.476
Ah, I don't care.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.945
That weaselly
little sneak!

20:14.012 --> 20:16.614
What the hell
are you smiling at?

20:16.682 --> 20:19.350
Our daughter's new husband
just made 50 grand

20:19.418 --> 20:20.718
in half a day.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.020
Maybe he's not the idiot
we thought he was.

20:23.088 --> 20:26.724
Huh. So maybe Hayley's judgment
isn't so bad.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.193
What do you know?
Maybe I won't hate

20:29.261 --> 20:30.428
my grandchildren
after all.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.229
So what do you
want to do now?

20:37.235 --> 20:38.469
What a day.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.240
50K. I love you, baby!

20:43.308 --> 20:44.809
I love you, too, babe.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.811
So, now that
we're married,

20:46.878 --> 20:48.179
there's something
I want you to see.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.593
Totally makes up

21:02.661 --> 21:04.261
for my small
penis, huh?
