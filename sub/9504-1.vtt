02:08.500 --> 02:10.257
I wish I could be like her.

02:10.356 --> 02:12.080
Also me.

02:12.181 --> 02:14.516
But you're a servant girl, Maya.

02:15.606 --> 02:16.883
I must go. She'll be waiting.

02:16.983 --> 02:17.714
And I?

02:17.815 --> 02:18.579
You can't go,

02:18.680 --> 02:20.469
But I'll come
and tell you everything.

02:34.972 --> 02:37.013
So, Kama Sutra,

02:37.117 --> 02:40.282
The greatest book
of love ever written.

02:40.382 --> 02:42.106
Kama means...

02:42.207 --> 02:43.484
love.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.209
And Sutra means?

02:45.312 --> 02:46.556
Lessons?

02:46.656 --> 02:48.183
Very good.

02:48.289 --> 02:49.718
So here we have it.

02:49.825 --> 02:51.386
Lessons on love.

02:51.489 --> 02:53.181
An ancient book on men and women

02:53.282 --> 02:55.934
and their relationship
through life together.

02:56.036 --> 02:58.273
Now, why do we study it,

02:58.372 --> 02:59.834
you may all ask,

02:59.940 --> 03:00.572
when it was written

03:00.677 --> 03:03.678
so many hundreds of years ago?

03:03.781 --> 03:06.979
Because love remains as meaningful
and mysterious today

03:07.079 --> 03:09.119
as it was then.

03:09.224 --> 03:10.686
The Kama Sutra teaches us

03:10.792 --> 03:13.029
the many ways to use
our body for love.

03:13.128 --> 03:15.016
It also teaches us

03:15.113 --> 03:16.390
that the ways of love

03:16.490 --> 03:18.017
are much deeper.

03:18.123 --> 03:19.847
But, of course, it tells us

03:19.946 --> 03:22.086
we must learn
to use our body very well.

03:22.187 --> 03:25.090
So... lift up your skirts

03:25.197 --> 03:26.474
and look at your...

03:27.373 --> 03:28.835
feet.

03:28.941 --> 03:30.087
One doesn't pay much attention

03:30.190 --> 03:32.580
to one's feet or toes.

03:32.686 --> 03:34.760
But believe me when I tell you...

03:35.600 --> 03:38.536
if you touch the toes and feet

03:38.641 --> 03:40.846
in a certain way...

03:40.945 --> 03:43.663
it can bring great
pleasure to your lover.

03:59.416 --> 04:00.212
Maya...

04:05.722 --> 04:07.861
Maya, is that you?

04:09.979 --> 04:11.703
Masi, why do I always have to wear

04:11.803 --> 04:13.112
Tara's old clothes

04:13.212 --> 04:15.187
when she never wears mine?

04:15.292 --> 04:17.202
What have I done in my past life

04:17.309 --> 04:20.375
to inherit you from your mad mother?

04:20.478 --> 04:23.162
Just because Tara and Biki
drank from my breast,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.824
they let you play with her.

04:24.928 --> 04:27.263
So what if you bathe with Tara?

04:27.361 --> 04:30.296
That doesn't mean you can
become a maharan in yourself.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.474
Be grateful they let
you dance with her.

04:36.451 --> 04:37.280
Maya.

04:37.379 --> 04:38.459
Biki.

04:51.496 --> 04:52.543
Just because you're a prince,

04:52.648 --> 04:54.274
you think you can spy on me?

04:55.914 --> 04:57.889
One day I will be king,

04:57.994 --> 05:01.443
and you will be my Queen...

05:01.547 --> 05:03.817
and my slave.

05:05.036 --> 05:06.247
I'm no one's slave.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.396
Forever!

05:08.621 --> 05:11.491
I want to know everything
Tara knows.

05:11.598 --> 05:13.803
You are truly pagli.

05:14.479 --> 05:15.756
My mad one.

05:17.456 --> 05:19.431
Hips just like your mother.

05:24.530 --> 05:26.570
When she danced one jhalak...

05:28.724 --> 05:30.318
And the room would be still.

05:33.493 --> 05:36.625
You'd better deserve those dancing
bells she left you.

06:07.744 --> 06:08.857
Very good, Maya.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.259
You are doing
the dance of enticement, Tara.

06:15.363 --> 06:17.785
You are the one
with the beautifuI eyes.

06:17.892 --> 06:19.583
So, play with them.

06:21.893 --> 06:23.781
You have to mesmerize with them.

06:26.438 --> 06:28.414
Don't give up, princess Tara.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.461
Come on, come on. Try.

07:25.849 --> 07:27.442
Beautiful dancing, Maya.

07:29.370 --> 07:31.028
Come, my princess Tara.

07:31.739 --> 07:33.081
My darling.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.028
This is for you.

07:38.205 --> 07:39.831
New clothes?

07:39.933 --> 07:41.210
For me?

07:41.310 --> 07:43.383
I've never had new clothes.

07:43.486 --> 07:44.916
Thank you, sahib.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.927
Tara.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.806
How is it?

07:55.906 --> 07:57.914
It looks like leftovers.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.249
You can wear it at my wedding.

08:03.621 --> 08:04.636
I am going to be married

08:04.742 --> 08:06.597
To the great Raj Singh.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.813
Such a tender flower,

08:20.522 --> 08:21.799
still unopened.

08:25.036 --> 08:26.924
Women, being of tender nature,

08:27.021 --> 08:29.738
want tender beginnings, eh?

08:30.862 --> 08:33.732
The wisdom of
the Kama Sutra is such,

08:33.839 --> 08:35.977
it teaches us not to rush.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.142
For the first 3 days
after marriage,

08:39.248 --> 08:40.972
the girl and the boy

08:41.073 --> 08:43.823
should abstain
from sexual pleasures.

08:43.921 --> 08:45.034
Oh, yes!

08:45.138 --> 08:46.382
On the 10th night,

08:46.483 --> 08:49.102
the king will begin
gentle love play

08:49.204 --> 08:50.666
to create confidence in you.

08:50.772 --> 08:51.787
He will embrace you

08:51.893 --> 08:54.577
with the upper part
of his body in darkness

08:54.678 --> 08:56.533
because he doesn't know you well.

08:57.142 --> 08:58.572
You should at this time

08:58.678 --> 09:01.232
accept his embrace

09:01.336 --> 09:05.395
and allow him to put
betel nut in your...

09:06.841 --> 09:08.052
mouth.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.401
God bless the alliance
of our two kingdoms.

10:19.504 --> 10:21.130
Now let's see if the king's bride

10:21.233 --> 10:22.891
is worth her weight in gold.

10:22.993 --> 10:24.139
Let's see.

10:25.203 --> 10:26.447
He's coming.

10:31.124 --> 10:32.717
He's so young.

10:34.773 --> 10:37.556
Small price to pay for such beauty.

10:38.678 --> 10:40.305
Let's hope she's worth it.

10:57.341 --> 10:58.650
Tara, he likes you.

10:58.749 --> 11:00.375
Go to your room.

11:22.372 --> 11:26.017
And when will this flower open?
Oh, my.

11:26.117 --> 11:28.092
I wait upon that night.

11:28.935 --> 11:30.561
And what a night that will be.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.091
Please come. Please come.

11:37.193 --> 11:38.622
Come here.

11:39.209 --> 11:39.711
Masi.

11:39.818 --> 11:41.225
Oh, Maya.

12:01.937 --> 12:03.115
That's her.

12:03.217 --> 12:03.915
There she is - -

12:04.017 --> 12:06.287
my lotus woman.

12:06.387 --> 12:08.176
Maybe that was my Padmini.

12:08.883 --> 12:10.444
I found her.

12:11.124 --> 12:11.920
I lost her.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.427
Seeing things again?

12:13.524 --> 12:14.353
What says the doctor?

12:14.453 --> 12:15.730
Examining, examining.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.237
Pulse tells all.

12:17.334 --> 12:19.276
Hey, Maya.

12:19.382 --> 12:20.430
Maya.

12:23.383 --> 12:25.424
Easy on those sweets.

12:25.529 --> 12:27.056
That's hot stuff.

12:28.089 --> 12:29.813
Aphrodisiacs.

12:33.755 --> 12:35.894
Put one in my mouth, Maya.

12:37.660 --> 12:40.629
Open your mouth
and close your eyes.

13:45.682 --> 13:46.762
Yes?

13:50.611 --> 13:53.033
Forgive me for disturbing you,
great king.

13:53.685 --> 13:54.798
Your name?

13:56.118 --> 13:57.580
Maya.

14:06.777 --> 14:08.720
Could you be anything but Maya?

14:13.147 --> 14:15.035
I've brought you something.

14:16.412 --> 14:18.933
Some malida to sweeten your tongue.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.873
This is all need.

14:35.170 --> 14:37.505
This is all need
to sweeten my tongue.

17:32.282 --> 17:33.625
Tara...

17:35.579 --> 17:36.823
You' re leaving us...

17:38.428 --> 17:40.371
Tara...

17:55.745 --> 17:56.509
Ma.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.558
Ma.

17:57.666 --> 17:59.324
Ma...

18:01.859 --> 18:04.129
Please get Maya for me.

18:04.869 --> 18:06.560
I want to marry her.

18:12.103 --> 18:13.314
This is for you, Maya.

18:17.736 --> 18:18.882
Tara...

18:21.225 --> 18:24.096
All my life I have lived
with your used things.

18:26.956 --> 18:27.883
But now...

18:30.828 --> 18:33.513
Something I have used
is yours forever.

19:21.564 --> 19:23.387
Maya!

19:23.485 --> 19:24.249
Maya.

19:24.349 --> 19:26.237
I'll eave this place forever!

19:26.334 --> 19:28.606
Maya.

19:28.703 --> 19:30.012
Maya, listen to me.

19:30.111 --> 19:31.421
Listen to me.

19:32.448 --> 19:34.074
Think about it.

19:34.881 --> 19:36.889
Biki loves you.

19:36.994 --> 19:39.547
You will be almost like Tara.

19:39.651 --> 19:42.499
You a princess and she a Queen.

19:42.595 --> 19:45.378
I'm supposed to just
say yes to everything?

19:45.476 --> 19:47.517
To Tara's clothes,
to her used dowry,

19:47.621 --> 19:49.280
And now to her brother?

19:51.910 --> 19:54.082
It is our destiny, Maya.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.270
I'll make my own destiny, Masi.

20:01.322 --> 20:03.177
Please.

20:03.274 --> 20:04.835
Let me be.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.599
She said no?

20:12.269 --> 20:13.065
Thank God.

20:13.166 --> 20:13.832
I could never show my face.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.210
Daughter marries king,

20:15.310 --> 20:17.350
Son marries servant girl.

20:21.552 --> 20:22.414
Come, ma.

20:25.905 --> 20:27.466
Come, ma!

20:45.912 --> 20:47.603
You whore!

20:51.258 --> 20:52.305
Please!

20:53.242 --> 20:56.404
Stop, please!

20:56.507 --> 20:58.875
Please, I beg of you, no.

21:00.221 --> 21:01.268
Biki.

21:04.958 --> 21:06.387
I'm so sorry.

21:12.128 --> 21:13.470
Please.

21:22.467 --> 21:23.416
Maya?

21:26.949 --> 21:28.029
Maya.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.391
Oh, Masi...

21:45.835 --> 21:47.362
You had better go, my pagli.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.906
Your mother's blessings
are with you.

21:52.013 --> 21:53.028
Go!

21:53.133 --> 21:56.266
And take these bells with you,

21:56.366 --> 21:57.741
so the world will know

21:57.839 --> 22:00.523
the whore is coming!

23:35.118 --> 23:36.427
For the blood.

23:37.455 --> 23:38.949
I know about the blood.

23:39.055 --> 23:40.103
Just put it underneath you

23:40.207 --> 23:41.996
at the time of the pain.

23:42.736 --> 23:43.630
What pain?

23:43.728 --> 23:46.576
Just like the tearing
of a backtooth.

23:46.673 --> 23:49.041
One moment there, one moment gone.

23:56.820 --> 23:57.748
Enough.

23:57.845 --> 24:00.147
She is ready for you, my son.

24:00.246 --> 24:02.134
Your good luck charm.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.043
One day you are
your father's property...

24:20.316 --> 24:22.139
The next day you are
your husband's property.

24:25.150 --> 24:26.677
Must be difficult.

24:35.681 --> 24:37.569
Why not put that around me?

25:19.919 --> 25:21.829
I promise I will not do it again

25:21.935 --> 25:23.462
if you embrace me.

25:24.401 --> 25:25.775
I cannot.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.182
You can.

25:30.450 --> 25:31.912
You even want to.

25:38.421 --> 25:39.501
No.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.100
Please.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.246
I will press the marks
of my teeth and nails

25:43.351 --> 25:44.114
into your breasts

25:44.215 --> 25:46.190
And I will say
I found you this way

25:46.295 --> 25:47.724
And that another man had done it.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.638
And what will you say then?

25:51.737 --> 25:54.193
I will say I am innocent.

25:55.739 --> 25:57.463
Who will believe you?

26:36.487 --> 26:38.048
Maya.

26:41.193 --> 26:42.535
Maya?

26:43.594 --> 26:45.984
You just called me Maya.

26:47.754 --> 26:49.282
Are you trying to read my mind?

26:49.387 --> 26:50.697
No.

26:50.796 --> 26:52.706
Did they not prepare you?

26:53.677 --> 26:56.230
Didn't they tell you never
to question your husband?

26:58.190 --> 26:59.620
No!

26:59.727 --> 27:02.117
Get me the chief courtesan!

29:08.919 --> 29:09.934
My name is Jai.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.375
Jai Kumar.

29:12.473 --> 29:13.455
I am the royal sculptor,

29:13.562 --> 29:15.089
And I saw you
at the king's wedding.

29:16.506 --> 29:17.717
You don't know this,

29:17.818 --> 29:19.510
But you inspire my work.

29:22.972 --> 29:24.434
I work in stone,

29:24.540 --> 29:26.712
Like these temples.

29:31.487 --> 29:33.724
It's hard to believe
she's made of stone.

29:33.824 --> 29:35.613
Why?

29:35.712 --> 29:37.022
Stone has life.

30:02.344 --> 30:03.457
Padmini.

30:48.216 --> 30:49.394
It's not right.

31:09.374 --> 31:10.716
Don't move.

31:11.935 --> 31:12.983
Maya!

31:15.969 --> 31:17.179
Maya!

31:25.987 --> 31:26.816
I'm sorry.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.864
Let me explain.

31:29.605 --> 31:31.515
I work with my hands.

31:31.621 --> 31:34.305
I didn't want to frighten you
or embarrass you.

31:35.910 --> 31:37.918
Why do you feeI so free
to touch me?

31:39.944 --> 31:42.311
And don't talk to me as
if I was your servant.

31:42.409 --> 31:44.297
I'm not your servant.

31:45.257 --> 31:47.713
A servant is a master in disguise.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.042
Where do you live?

31:57.677 --> 31:59.434
Come, I'Il walk you home.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.500
You do have a home to go to?

32:06.769 --> 32:08.263
Listen, I know somewhere.

32:08.369 --> 32:10.028
If you agree, I can take you there.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.272
She is wonderful.

32:12.370 --> 32:14.280
She teaches the Kama Sutra.

32:14.387 --> 32:15.402
Everything I'm trying
to understand

32:15.507 --> 32:18.356
About love in my work, she knows.

32:18.452 --> 32:20.110
Let me take you to her.

32:41.436 --> 32:43.160
When you dance
the dance of enticement

32:43.260 --> 32:44.788
For a man,

32:44.892 --> 32:48.242
You dance like he's the only one
left in the world

32:49.662 --> 32:51.703
Come on. Come on, try.

32:51.807 --> 32:52.985
Play.

33:20.680 --> 33:21.825
Rasa.

33:22.729 --> 33:24.617
Jai Kumar.

33:24.713 --> 33:27.529
And to what do we owe this honor?

33:27.626 --> 33:28.936
This is Maya...

33:29.035 --> 33:30.890
A new friend.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.732
She needs a place to stay.

33:34.828 --> 33:35.777
Come, Maya.

33:35.884 --> 33:37.194
Join us.

33:44.976 --> 33:46.351
Play.

33:47.601 --> 33:49.260
So Tara was being weighed in gold,

33:49.361 --> 33:52.297
And she insulted me
before the kind, so I...

33:52.402 --> 33:54.705
You what?

33:57.011 --> 33:58.538
I went to the king's chamber,

33:58.644 --> 33:59.757
and I gave myself to him

33:59.860 --> 34:01.170
the night of his wedding.

34:01.269 --> 34:04.172
Ohh. Was he as good as his father?

34:04.278 --> 34:05.140
Oh, Rasa Devi,

34:05.238 --> 34:06.897
The fuss, the shame.

34:06.999 --> 34:08.428
Shame?

34:08.534 --> 34:10.641
Now, that is an ancient word.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.501
When the king I served
as chief courtesan

34:12.601 --> 34:13.779
Went to war,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.467
The Queen, being the dutiful wife
she was,

34:16.569 --> 34:18.839
Washed his feet with holy water.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.083
She drank the same water

34:20.187 --> 34:22.773
every day he was gone.

34:22.876 --> 34:24.699
When he came back...

34:24.797 --> 34:27.797
He rode straight to my door.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.495
Do you think
that honored the Queen?

34:31.742 --> 34:33.815
Honor and shame

34:33.918 --> 34:36.341
May be two sides of the same coin.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.768
It's so beautiful here.

34:40.866 --> 34:43.136
You are welcome to live
with us here, Maya.

34:43.234 --> 34:44.795
I prepare women.

34:44.899 --> 34:49.603
Some become courtesans
in the king's harem.

34:49.699 --> 34:52.156
I teach my girls the Kama Sutra- -

34:52.261 --> 34:53.090
That the art of love

34:53.190 --> 34:55.579
is much more than the act itself.

34:56.327 --> 34:57.439
Come.

34:57.543 --> 34:58.885
Rest.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.060
You have it in you

35:22.159 --> 35:24.298
to be a great courtesan, Maya.

35:25.007 --> 35:26.982
Reserved maybe
for Raj Singh himself.

35:27.088 --> 35:28.016
The king?

35:28.113 --> 35:29.193
And why not?

35:29.297 --> 35:31.054
No, Rasa Devi, never.

35:31.154 --> 35:32.431
Hush.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.418
We shall not speak of it again.

35:35.379 --> 35:37.419
You stay here as a daughter.

35:37.524 --> 35:39.248
And if you change your mind...

35:39.957 --> 35:41.518
You come tell me.

35:54.393 --> 35:55.855
I used to worship inside temples...

35:57.594 --> 35:59.831
UntiI I saw that everything
around me was holy...

36:01.819 --> 36:02.965
The waterfall...

36:04.732 --> 36:05.845
Stone...

36:07.710 --> 36:08.920
Grass.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.375
All pure spirit.

36:15.199 --> 36:20.219
Now like a madman,
I worship everything I see...

36:21.825 --> 36:23.233
like you.

36:44.329 --> 36:45.671
There's a story told

36:45.769 --> 36:47.558
about the neighboring king

36:47.658 --> 36:49.185
and his favorite courtesan.

36:50.059 --> 36:51.783
This courtesan became pregnant

36:51.884 --> 36:54.503
at the same time as his Queen.

36:54.604 --> 36:55.587
She gave birth to a son

36:55.692 --> 36:58.115
a few days before the Queen
had a daughter.

36:58.221 --> 37:00.393
The courtesan knew that her son
would be considered

37:00.494 --> 37:01.771
A threat to the throne,

37:01.870 --> 37:05.800
so the eunuchs would be dispatched
to kill her child.

37:05.904 --> 37:08.043
She was determined to save him.

37:12.465 --> 37:16.777
It was diwali, and the potters
came to gift their vessels.

37:16.883 --> 37:18.477
Suddenly, the courtesan
had an idea.

37:18.579 --> 37:20.849
She begged one of the potters

37:20.948 --> 37:23.666
to smuggle her baby out
in an unused urn.

37:24.662 --> 37:26.767
Did the courtesan
see her son again?

37:26.870 --> 37:28.911
Yes, she did.

37:29.015 --> 37:31.699
Every few years the boy would be
dressed as a girl

37:31.800 --> 37:34.223
and smuggled into the inner court.

37:34.329 --> 37:37.047
Why?

37:37.146 --> 37:39.765
Men can't enter the harem.

37:39.866 --> 37:44.341
So they dressed the boy up,

37:44.444 --> 37:46.933
and his mother would take him
along secret passages.

37:48.125 --> 37:50.810
They would spend
a few hours together.

37:51.967 --> 37:54.837
Then he would be smuggled out...

37:54.943 --> 37:57.465
And the courtesan knew
that it would be some time

37:57.568 --> 37:59.424
before she saw her child again.

38:02.082 --> 38:04.384
A few years later she died.

38:11.621 --> 38:13.182
Maya, come.

38:49.808 --> 38:53.606
And this position is called
twining of the creeper.

38:54.706 --> 38:55.567
Now we add to this

38:55.666 --> 38:58.253
what the Kama Sutra calls
the throbbing kiss.

39:00.308 --> 39:02.830
And this is the way for both
lovers to have the pleasure

39:02.933 --> 39:05.422
of kissing the lower lip
at the same time.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.277
This was gentle.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.514
What about when love
feels intense?

39:14.616 --> 39:16.472
On the first union, for example,

39:16.569 --> 39:19.604
or when angry lovers
are reconciled?

39:19.706 --> 39:23.188
Or when one is intoxicated
and full of energy?

39:23.292 --> 39:26.642
How can we express
our passion then?

39:26.748 --> 39:30.327
Called by the Kama Sutra,
"the blade of the saw."

39:32.095 --> 39:34.397
A woman who sees the marks of her
lover's nails on her body

39:34.495 --> 39:36.885
becomes excited again.

39:41.281 --> 39:44.578
Always remember, there should
be variety in love sport.

40:04.585 --> 40:07.138
Jai, your Padmini is there.

40:10.059 --> 40:12.164
There, there. She's been
waiting for hours. Go.

41:07.100 --> 41:09.436
I forgot to return this
to you the other day.

41:15.039 --> 41:15.705
You touch me,

41:15.808 --> 41:19.256
and I don't know if it's
about your work or...

41:19.360 --> 41:21.149
About what?

41:21.249 --> 41:24.316
Something else.
Don't ask me to name it.

41:27.971 --> 41:30.208
Is what you do different from them,

41:30.308 --> 41:32.676
from the men in the street?

41:33.445 --> 41:35.388
You're the same as them,
aren't you?

41:36.326 --> 41:39.174
You're accusing me of being
the same as those men?

41:41.319 --> 41:42.727
I'll take you somewhere tonight,

41:42.824 --> 41:44.613
and you can see for yourself.

41:45.481 --> 41:47.970
But you will have
to dress like a man.

41:51.146 --> 41:53.089
Examining. Examining.

42:11.601 --> 42:13.325
Leave. I'm going in as a commoner.

42:18.707 --> 42:20.464
Can I have some wine?

42:45.724 --> 42:46.652
Kumar.

42:46.748 --> 42:47.697
Sahib?

42:47.804 --> 42:49.692
You don't know me, Kumar.

42:49.789 --> 42:51.895
Tonight I'm one of you.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.158
Come here, you cheap little slut.

42:55.807 --> 42:58.175
There is joy in 3 things - -

42:58.271 --> 43:00.825
Eating meat, riding meat,

43:00.929 --> 43:02.839
and putting meat into meat.

43:05.506 --> 43:06.968
I need a woman.

43:08.195 --> 43:10.716
Chand Rabai, can you get me
a young one?

43:10.820 --> 43:14.912
May I entreat you to see
a special flower of mine?

43:15.013 --> 43:18.844
A virgin as yet unknown to men.

43:18.950 --> 43:22.050
I had a virgin not so long ago.

43:22.152 --> 43:25.000
A strange girl with a face
like a Queen.

43:25.097 --> 43:27.301
Sometimes I still long for her.

43:40.110 --> 43:42.150
All the way from the Himalayas.

43:42.254 --> 43:45.102
Padmini herself.

43:46.511 --> 43:48.268
A fresh rose of the gutter

43:48.368 --> 43:50.408
To bloom only for you.

44:09.942 --> 44:11.983
Almost the face of a Queen.

44:15.577 --> 44:16.984
I'll take her.

44:20.186 --> 44:21.943
Enjoying? Huh?

44:38.944 --> 44:40.286
Oh, Rasa!

44:45.698 --> 44:48.928
You have seen how some men
can be like animals,

44:49.027 --> 44:51.516
but it is not all men.

44:51.620 --> 44:54.752
I don't believe Jai Kumar
is like that.

44:55.429 --> 44:58.332
And since when is woman simply
a helpless animal?

44:59.078 --> 45:01.413
Just like men, we are awake

45:01.511 --> 45:02.755
and filled with longing.

45:02.855 --> 45:03.586
But - -

45:03.688 --> 45:05.412
No buts.

45:05.512 --> 45:09.027
Passion remains the spirit
behind existence, Maya.

45:09.129 --> 45:11.170
Nothing will ever change that.

45:11.978 --> 45:14.532
It's how we use our passion
that is of essence.

45:15.403 --> 45:18.536
Now we must listen to what
the Kama Sutra teaches,

45:18.636 --> 45:21.004
That the true union
between man and woman

45:21.101 --> 45:25.292
can take us beyond this
animal lust into total trust

45:25.391 --> 45:27.530
and merging with the other,

45:27.631 --> 45:30.250
where each becomes both.

45:30.352 --> 45:32.175
Imagine such bliss.

45:59.450 --> 46:02.353
The story you told me
about the courtesan and her son,

46:03.131 --> 46:04.724
it was you, wasn't it?

49:42.433 --> 49:43.381
Jai.

49:44.674 --> 49:48.319
I made some coconut rice for you.

49:50.435 --> 49:53.087
I know you don't usually eat
when you work.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.443
Something's wrong.

49:56.549 --> 49:58.143
What is it?
Tell me.

50:02.247 --> 50:03.840
I'm working differently.

50:03.943 --> 50:05.853
But that's good, isn't it?

50:06.953 --> 50:08.840
She's beautiful.

50:10.346 --> 50:12.485
Something about being
with you has...

50:14.827 --> 50:18.538
When I work,
I see you all the time.

50:19.564 --> 50:21.954
You're with me at every moment.

50:28.463 --> 50:32.239
Is that all you see in me,
your work,

50:32.337 --> 50:34.028
a piece of stone?

50:34.129 --> 50:35.624
What if I can't work properly
without you?

50:35.729 --> 50:36.558
You don't have to.

50:36.658 --> 50:37.868
We can work together.

50:37.970 --> 50:39.913
No. I've never needed anyone.

50:40.019 --> 50:42.354
I've never need
to rely on anyone.

50:53.719 --> 50:55.377
We can't be together.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.612
Don't fall in love with me.

51:04.955 --> 51:07.377
You were the one that talked
about love all the time.

51:18.047 --> 51:21.310
And now it's facing you,
you run from it.

51:58.444 --> 52:00.648
Sometimes things
don't make sense immediately.

52:06.831 --> 52:08.686
I have known him a few years now.

52:09.487 --> 52:11.146
He is used to being alone.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.183
Be patient, Maya.

52:15.281 --> 52:16.624
Be patient.

52:16.721 --> 52:19.439
I loved being with him.

52:19.539 --> 52:23.501
I would have done anything
just to be with him.

52:23.604 --> 52:26.026
What kind of love are you
talking about,

52:26.133 --> 52:27.922
real love?

52:29.078 --> 52:31.413
If you're looking for real love,

52:31.511 --> 52:33.813
you've chosen
the hardest task of all.

52:35.511 --> 52:39.473
The work for which all
other work is but preparation.

52:40.953 --> 52:44.435
But I was ready.

52:44.539 --> 52:47.409
I wanted to give myself to him.

52:47.515 --> 52:49.687
Love does not mean surrendering,

52:49.788 --> 52:52.156
losing yourself.

52:52.253 --> 52:54.872
It is a call to ripen.

52:55.646 --> 52:57.883
Don't look for straight lines,
Maya.

52:57.983 --> 53:00.122
Life is never like that.

53:04.545 --> 53:07.131
I want to understand properly,
Rasa Devi.

53:07.234 --> 53:09.023
I want to learn
about the rules of love

53:09.122 --> 53:11.457
and how to apply them.

53:11.555 --> 53:15.134
And if I can't use them
on the one I love...

53:16.133 --> 53:18.173
I'll use them on the ones I don't.

53:20.614 --> 53:21.661
Teach me.

53:21.766 --> 53:23.228
I'm ready.

53:24.647 --> 53:27.201
At all times and in all countries,

53:27.304 --> 53:29.127
there's ever been a little rivalry

53:29.225 --> 53:32.259
between the chaste
and the unchaste.

53:32.362 --> 53:34.534
But while some women
are born courtesans,

53:34.635 --> 53:35.682
let's face it,

53:35.787 --> 53:37.959
every woman has got
an inkling of the profession

53:38.060 --> 53:38.954
in her nature

53:39.052 --> 53:42.184
and makes herself agreable
to the other sex.

53:42.285 --> 53:44.292
One of the arts of courtesan

53:44.398 --> 53:47.214
is that while she involves
herself in sex

53:47.311 --> 53:49.133
without love,

53:49.231 --> 53:53.804
she conducts herself as
if love were indeed natural.

53:53.904 --> 53:56.523
Because we all know
that men love women

53:56.626 --> 53:59.212
who apparently love them.

53:59.314 --> 54:01.704
But even courtesans should not
always be welcoming

54:01.811 --> 54:04.911
because we must know that men
are apt to despise

54:05.012 --> 54:08.177
things that are easily acquired.

54:10.262 --> 54:12.630
You can hear all these rules,

54:12.726 --> 54:17.332
but remember once the wheel
of love is set in motion...

54:17.432 --> 54:20.150
there are no rules and no order.

54:26.779 --> 54:27.924
Salute the day!

54:28.027 --> 54:29.970
Salute the hills and flowers!

54:34.270 --> 54:35.448
Enough.

54:48.450 --> 54:49.727
Is this the statue?

54:57.861 --> 54:59.290
Whose is this?

54:59.398 --> 55:00.925
It's mine, sahib.

55:01.030 --> 55:02.786
Yours, Kumar?

55:09.513 --> 55:12.995
So imbued is this stone
with the warmth of woman.

55:14.602 --> 55:16.458
I want to kiss the skin.

55:20.877 --> 55:22.503
I have kissed the skin.

55:29.583 --> 55:31.372
I have kissed this skin.

55:32.784 --> 55:34.890
Who is she?

55:34.992 --> 55:36.367
A young woman I found - -

55:36.465 --> 55:38.058
Bring her to me.

55:38.162 --> 55:40.170
I wish I could, sahib,

55:40.275 --> 55:42.414
but she disappeared.

55:43.699 --> 55:45.161
Then we must find her.

55:45.268 --> 55:46.675
Sahib.

55:48.117 --> 55:50.606
As a reward for your
most excellent work, Kumar,

55:50.709 --> 55:51.724
You shall wrestle me.

55:51.830 --> 55:53.619
Vazir, pay the man
his weight in gold.

55:53.719 --> 55:55.148
Sahib.

56:50.697 --> 56:52.738
You made her wait.

56:52.841 --> 56:54.598
Now you will have to wait.

57:11.343 --> 57:12.653
Listen! Listen!

57:12.752 --> 57:16.102
We are looking for the woman
who inspired Jai Kumar.

57:16.209 --> 57:19.439
Her skin, the color of freshly
harvested wheat.

57:19.538 --> 57:23.085
Her limbs long and languorous

57:23.187 --> 57:24.879
like the creeper.

57:49.564 --> 57:50.971
Thank you.

57:56.830 --> 57:59.034
Are you ready, my preciou s child?

57:59.807 --> 58:01.695
I'm frightened.

58:02.400 --> 58:05.084
I was frightened, too,
the day they came for me.

58:06.305 --> 58:08.728
It is good to be
a little frightened

58:08.834 --> 58:12.283
because it means you feel things.

58:15.492 --> 58:16.867
Come.

58:59.218 --> 59:00.844
Another courtesan, my Queen.

59:00.947 --> 59:02.671
Name?

59:02.770 --> 59:03.981
Maya.

59:06.676 --> 59:08.138
Maya?

59:22.009 --> 59:22.992
Enough!

59:24.409 --> 59:25.784
Tara!

59:27.931 --> 59:30.802
How long do you expect to languish?

59:30.908 --> 59:32.283
All day?

59:33.244 --> 59:35.383
I was longing to see you.

59:36.733 --> 59:38.457
Get out!

59:45.792 --> 59:47.287
My son has an eye.

59:48.002 --> 59:49.344
I trained him.

59:57.284 --> 59:58.397
Yours?

59:58.501 --> 01:00:00.356
Of course.

01:00:03.719 --> 01:00:05.727
'Tis the usual custom.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:12.131
The usual custom no longer applies.

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:21.322
If a courtesan is
not elegantly attired,

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.355
she will not exhilarate my husband.

01:00:24.461 --> 01:00:26.828
Exhilaration is my department.

01:00:29.006 --> 01:00:30.021
You get me something new,

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.916
or we will keep
your husband waiting.

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:35.849
And I'm sure I will
be blamed for it.

01:00:37.265 --> 01:00:39.568
He is full of lust,
and she is in the eye.

01:00:39.665 --> 01:00:41.706
Get her something new
and quickly, Tara.

01:00:51.637 --> 01:00:52.717
Sahib?

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:57.013
What news from the stars?

01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:00.942
There is news of the shah, sahib.

01:01:01.848 --> 01:01:03.125
Later.

01:01:03.898 --> 01:01:06.320
Tell me the stars.

01:01:06.426 --> 01:01:08.598
Jupiter, the sign of good fortune,

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:10.969
Is placed in your house
of love and marriage.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.781
An auspicious time for love.

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:17.467
Good.

01:01:17.565 --> 01:01:20.915
Sahib, we must speak.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.841
I said later.

01:01:32.003 --> 01:01:35.419
Vazir, matters of state
are your affair

01:01:35.523 --> 01:01:37.564
as love is mine.

01:02:22.803 --> 01:02:23.916
Adjust.

01:02:24.019 --> 01:02:25.394
Adjust, my child.

01:02:34.358 --> 01:02:35.919
It's an old story.

01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:38.576
He had her on your wedding night...

01:02:40.953 --> 01:02:43.255
just the way Rasa had my husband.

01:02:45.626 --> 01:02:48.147
There are courtesans,
and then there are wives.

01:02:49.339 --> 01:02:50.801
There are dozens like her,

01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:53.748
but you are Queen.

01:03:29.383 --> 01:03:31.359
The glory of God is in you.

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:02.686
Oh, it was a good night.

01:05:03.878 --> 01:05:07.141
Kumar, whose artistry
pleases my Gods,

01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:09.695
what ever you've heard,
in the ring, we're equal.

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:15.431
With or without claws?

01:05:15.529 --> 01:05:18.978
I can be lethal enough
without them.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.490
Good.

01:06:03.032 --> 01:06:04.942
You do that again,
you'll have no arms.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:11.028
Forgive me, sahib.

01:06:17.053 --> 01:06:18.963
Good fight, Kumar.

01:06:20.126 --> 01:06:21.752
We have some work to discuss.

01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:23.861
Will you join me tonight?

01:06:33.314 --> 01:06:35.224
People say I think
too much about women.

01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:40.572
What is there more important
to think about?

01:06:50.343 --> 01:06:51.554
To our great king.

01:06:51.656 --> 01:06:53.729
Started off a great warrior,

01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:56.867
Ended as an insect sucking
on a poppy flower.

01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:58.246
Vazir.

01:06:58.346 --> 01:07:01.064
Captured. You draw
the fleeting moment.

01:07:01.163 --> 01:07:02.756
Show me the eternal.

01:07:07.725 --> 01:07:09.514
You did make love to Maya, then?

01:07:11.247 --> 01:07:13.135
You know her name?

01:07:13.231 --> 01:07:14.660
I know everything.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:17.421
Answer me.

01:07:17.521 --> 01:07:18.950
I'm waiting.

01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:22.060
Work can only be an act of love.

01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:25.488
You will go to China
to fetch another,

01:07:25.587 --> 01:07:26.994
you clumsy son of a whore!

01:07:27.091 --> 01:07:28.618
Yes, sahib. Right away.

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.873
I have found your girl, Kumar.

01:07:35.734 --> 01:07:37.043
Sit, sit.

01:07:40.408 --> 01:07:42.164
I tell you she governs me
and winds me up

01:07:42.264 --> 01:07:43.312
at a whim.

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:47.317
My moods depend on her.

01:07:48.634 --> 01:07:51.537
I want to open my eyes
to her under me...

01:07:54.877 --> 01:07:56.438
in the morning.

01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:01.685
You should be given an audience
with her, Kumar.

01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:07.229
I want you to carve her
across the roof of my room...

01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:12.223
But if I was God, I'd carve her
across the bright blue sky.

01:08:24.037 --> 01:08:25.663
Poison.

01:08:25.765 --> 01:08:27.075
Bitter as bile.

01:08:27.174 --> 01:08:28.287
But when taken from childhood,

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.366
it makes you immune from enemies.

01:09:12.821 --> 01:09:14.609
My Raj...

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:26.734
All my life...

01:09:26.841 --> 01:09:29.078
I have lived with your used things.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:33.077
Now all your life, you'll use mine.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.871
So...

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:37.524
Tell me, are you happy now?

01:09:38.365 --> 01:09:39.926
Tara...

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:43.060
I was young.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.978
I had no idea then

01:09:50.081 --> 01:09:51.325
that what I did that night

01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:55.137
would change your life forever...

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.696
and mine, too.

01:09:56.803 --> 01:09:59.040
You got what you wanted.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.555
He desires you.

01:10:04.358 --> 01:10:05.820
At least one of us is happy.

01:10:05.926 --> 01:10:08.229
Do you think that just
because the king desires me,

01:10:08.327 --> 01:10:08.959
it makes me happy?

01:10:09.063 --> 01:10:10.689
Does it not?

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:14.589
No, Tara, it does not.

01:10:22.315 --> 01:10:23.297
Sometimes...

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.290
When I catch a glimpse
of the world out side...

01:10:31.053 --> 01:10:34.153
trees, sky...

01:10:43.026 --> 01:10:45.645
I wish we were free like
when we were children.

01:10:48.851 --> 01:10:50.313
Tara...

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:10.423
You meet again.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.368
Enchanted.

01:11:15.868 --> 01:11:17.462
What shall I do?

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:18.874
Will you dance?

01:11:50.087 --> 01:11:51.615
I like this position.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.295
I did not agree to sculpting
by committee, sahib.

01:11:58.858 --> 01:12:01.030
Allow me the honor of a...

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:03.040
An artist's privacy.

01:12:33.973 --> 01:12:35.217
I love you.

01:12:37.078 --> 01:12:39.021
You love only yourself.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:49.432
How naive of me.

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.666
Maya.

01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:14.112
Maya.

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.737
Forgive me, please.

01:13:15.842 --> 01:13:17.818
I was afraid of losing control.

01:13:24.581 --> 01:13:25.661
Maya.

01:13:27.558 --> 01:13:29.053
You hurt me.

01:13:33.896 --> 01:13:35.391
I belong to him now.

01:13:35.496 --> 01:13:36.642
No.

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:42.629
I belong to you.

01:13:59.825 --> 01:14:01.199
I made a mistake.

01:14:05.426 --> 01:14:06.768
Take me back.

01:14:19.703 --> 01:14:21.078
Jai...

01:14:38.685 --> 01:14:40.540
I marry you...

01:14:40.637 --> 01:14:42.012
You marry me.

01:14:51.296 --> 01:14:54.297
I marry you...

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:55.963
You marry me.

01:15:31.982 --> 01:15:35.300
Dr. Mani, we believe Queen Tara
is hysterical.

01:15:35.407 --> 01:15:37.961
We found her flushed
and without breath.

01:15:38.064 --> 01:15:40.431
Her body does not keep
from twisting.

01:15:40.528 --> 01:15:43.212
Have the spirits possessed her?
I want to know.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.476
Her heart, please.

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:07.893
So?

01:16:07.993 --> 01:16:09.554
Her pulse...

01:16:09.658 --> 01:16:10.738
It's normal.

01:16:20.702 --> 01:16:23.158
Examining.

01:16:45.573 --> 01:16:46.850
Sahib.

01:16:56.169 --> 01:16:58.558
It seems the opium
has made you half a man.

01:16:58.665 --> 01:17:01.928
You can not pass her over.
I've heard rumors

01:17:02.026 --> 01:17:05.159
that her own brother's being
courted by the shah.

01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:07.365
Invaders like the shah,
with or without that hunch back

01:17:07.468 --> 01:17:08.995
are no match for my strength.

01:17:09.101 --> 01:17:10.759
It is not you that are strong.

01:17:10.861 --> 01:17:13.317
It is your neighbors that are weak.

01:17:13.422 --> 01:17:14.851
The Gods protect me.

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.682
I will show you. Biki is nothing.

01:17:16.783 --> 01:17:18.027
Just show me an heir from the Queen

01:17:18.127 --> 01:17:18.891
Nothing!

01:17:18.992 --> 01:17:21.578
Before I get a bastard
from one of your whores!

01:17:23.793 --> 01:17:26.347
Ha ha! Sweet brother-in-law,
this is your home.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.488
You can have anything you want.

01:17:30.611 --> 01:17:31.921
Now, what can I offer you?

01:17:33.525 --> 01:17:34.834
More music?

01:17:36.725 --> 01:17:37.489
Oh. Boys.

01:17:37.589 --> 01:17:39.248
Boys?
Do you insult me?

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:41.325
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:45.620
Or is it time you had women?

01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:48.466
Ha ha! I always wanted women..

01:17:49.242 --> 01:17:51.730
ever since I... ha ha... stood up.

01:17:53.851 --> 01:17:55.259
Women?

01:17:55.356 --> 01:17:56.785
Certainly, women you shall have.

01:17:56.891 --> 01:17:58.266
You shall have
the pick of my harem.

01:17:58.364 --> 01:17:59.412
How many do you want?

01:18:00.989 --> 01:18:02.451
3?

01:18:02.557 --> 01:18:03.802
4? Ha ha ha!

01:18:04.607 --> 01:18:06.680
Don't worry, we'll blindfold them.

01:18:09.856 --> 01:18:11.711
And tie up their hands as well.

01:18:23.396 --> 01:18:26.048
I write this in
the interest of the people,

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.517
who are being neglected
by a debauched king.

01:18:31.815 --> 01:18:33.091
Now take this to the shah.

01:18:33.191 --> 01:18:33.857
Sahib.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.651
He has insulted my sister

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.641
and squeezes the common folk
each day

01:18:37.737 --> 01:18:41.033
to feed his appetites.
He has put his affairs

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:43.880
entirely in the hands of
his prime minister, the Vazir.

01:18:44.651 --> 01:18:48.329
I put myself in your royal hands
as an ally.

01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:50.022
Prince Bikram Singh.

01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:53.720
I want to be alone.

01:20:03.204 --> 01:20:04.186
I want to be alone with you.

01:20:04.293 --> 01:20:05.820
Raj.

01:20:10.022 --> 01:20:11.037
Just you and I...

01:20:24.747 --> 01:20:26.089
Let me lie in your arms.

01:20:32.205 --> 01:20:33.580
Give me some comfort.

01:20:39.024 --> 01:20:41.742
Oh, please.

01:20:41.841 --> 01:20:43.215
What?

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.351
I cannot.

01:20:59.894 --> 01:21:02.350
Do you think you're the only woman?

01:21:03.127 --> 01:21:03.891
I have hundreds waiting.

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.486
Go to them.

01:21:14.714 --> 01:21:16.057
Once you wanted me.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.765
I serviced you, that's all.

01:21:22.557 --> 01:21:24.346
You have no power over me.

01:21:26.335 --> 01:21:27.415
Go.

01:21:35.874 --> 01:21:37.467
Go, now.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.225
My love.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:59.428
Oh, my love.
I can't continue this way.

01:22:04.971 --> 01:22:07.622
This is the last time
I sneak in like some rat!

01:22:10.028 --> 01:22:11.916
I'm his courtesan, that's all.

01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:33.165
Beautiful women are a law
unto themselves.

01:22:36.981 --> 01:22:39.153
I no longer have
any authority over her.

01:22:43.607 --> 01:22:44.818
Life is strange.

01:22:51.353 --> 01:22:52.215
Fight me.

01:22:55.323 --> 01:22:56.567
Fight me, Kumar!

01:22:59.677 --> 01:23:01.051
I want to sweat.

01:23:02.462 --> 01:23:03.476
Claws!

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:07.257
And bleed.

01:23:14.369 --> 01:23:15.482
Opium!

01:23:36.424 --> 01:23:37.439
Strike!

01:23:38.953 --> 01:23:40.066
Strike!

01:24:22.647 --> 01:24:24.174
Why did you do this?

01:24:30.458 --> 01:24:32.465
I cannot stand this anymore.

01:24:34.618 --> 01:24:38.362
Because I love you,
my work has a power

01:24:38.459 --> 01:24:40.249
that even I cannot explain.

01:24:43.933 --> 01:24:45.527
What do I work for?

01:24:49.599 --> 01:24:52.251
To arouse this king of ours?

01:24:52.928 --> 01:24:54.456
We leave tonight.

01:24:58.722 --> 01:25:00.861
As soon as it's dark,
we'll find a way out.

01:25:03.588 --> 01:25:05.246
Where's the whore with
the heart of a vulture?

01:25:07.621 --> 01:25:08.799
Where is she?

01:25:17.992 --> 01:25:19.519
Were you invited?

01:25:21.802 --> 01:25:23.974
I didn't ask him in, my love.
Did you?

01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:27.360
You.

01:25:29.516 --> 01:25:31.207
You offend me.

01:25:31.309 --> 01:25:33.349
It is a crime to offend your ruler.

01:25:33.453 --> 01:25:34.249
Ruler?

01:25:34.349 --> 01:25:37.001
You reign, sahib. You do not rule.

01:25:40.048 --> 01:25:41.804
You will die, Kumar.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.358
You will die like the bastard
commoner you are!

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.497
Take him away
to the valley of stones.

01:25:48.594 --> 01:25:51.149
No!

01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:52.298
No!

01:25:53.267 --> 01:25:54.926
No!

01:25:55.028 --> 01:25:56.752
No!

01:25:56.852 --> 01:25:57.835
No!

01:25:59.606 --> 01:26:01.133
No!

01:26:36.129 --> 01:26:37.788
What are you going to do?

01:26:44.388 --> 01:26:45.949
What am I going to do?

01:27:43.511 --> 01:27:44.591
Tara!

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.255
I hate you.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.566
All my life you hated me!

01:28:00.668 --> 01:28:03.319
You could have finished me off,
but you didn't!

01:28:03.421 --> 01:28:05.789
You know why?

01:28:05.885 --> 01:28:07.544
Because I survived you.

01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:10.009
I wanted to live.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.619
Now you better survive me...

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.127
And your husband...

01:28:16.225 --> 01:28:19.488
And any - - Anything else
that happens to hurt you.

01:28:40.425 --> 01:28:42.214
They took him.

01:28:44.586 --> 01:28:45.994
Who?

01:28:49.003 --> 01:28:50.531
Jai Kumar.

01:28:55.982 --> 01:28:58.317
You love Jai Kumar?

01:29:36.154 --> 01:29:38.195
We shall not surrender to despair.

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:43.637
This is really not so difficult.

01:29:45.726 --> 01:29:47.450
I can show you how to dress.

01:29:48.478 --> 01:29:50.813
I can show you how to mark him
and touch him.

01:29:53.088 --> 01:29:54.812
Men are not such a mystery.

01:29:58.401 --> 01:29:59.929
First I will mark you.

01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:53.004
He will know a woman
made these marks.

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:55.882
It will excite him.

01:31:11.737 --> 01:31:12.850
Maya.

01:31:13.561 --> 01:31:15.253
Jai is going to be killed...

01:31:15.354 --> 01:31:16.784
And I cannot stop it.

01:31:23.997 --> 01:31:25.721
I will help you see him.

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:41.983
Now is the time.

01:31:42.083 --> 01:31:43.971
The doctor will help you.

01:31:58.536 --> 01:31:59.583
Thank you.

01:31:59.688 --> 01:32:01.063
Our deepest gratitude, doctor.

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:19.589
Vazir?

01:32:21.455 --> 01:32:22.601
Who is it?

01:32:24.464 --> 01:32:25.741
Speak up.

01:32:29.298 --> 01:32:30.608
Greetings, Raj.

01:32:35.027 --> 01:32:36.238
Tara?

01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:17.503
Maya's taught you well.

01:33:30.693 --> 01:33:34.142
In the end... it always
comes down to the wife.

01:34:12.722 --> 01:34:14.632
The mark of a tiger's nail.

01:34:20.725 --> 01:34:22.766
You are common to many women.

01:34:25.046 --> 01:34:27.185
I would see you always...

01:34:27.287 --> 01:34:29.743
So aroused by others...

01:34:29.848 --> 01:34:33.012
Undressing them with your eyes.

01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:36.369
How I loved you then.

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:39.543
And how I anguished.

01:34:39.643 --> 01:34:41.531
You do hate me.

01:34:41.627 --> 01:34:43.002
No, Raj.

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.402
I do not love you enough...

01:34:45.501 --> 01:34:47.127
to hate you.

01:35:38.606 --> 01:35:39.653
Jai?

01:35:44.047 --> 01:35:45.739
Jai.

01:35:58.228 --> 01:35:59.854
Embrace me, my love.

01:36:18.843 --> 01:36:21.015
You have to be very brave, my love.

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:25.075
They take you tomorrow.

01:36:28.029 --> 01:36:30.135
And I will be with you always.

01:36:32.607 --> 01:36:34.201
Always.

01:36:46.627 --> 01:36:47.969
Maya.

01:37:05.385 --> 01:37:07.295
Bind me to you
with this hair forever.

01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:28.646
I am yours.

01:37:31.601 --> 01:37:32.714
Take me.

01:37:34.323 --> 01:37:35.982
Cut this hair. It's yours.

01:37:55.930 --> 01:37:57.621
My flower.

01:37:58.842 --> 01:37:59.988
Jai...

01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:01.815
You have my heart.

01:38:22.722 --> 01:38:24.413
I love you.

01:39:20.564 --> 01:39:22.059
You came back for me.

01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:26.933
Even like this, I want you.

01:39:28.407 --> 01:39:29.716
You have me.

01:39:35.097 --> 01:39:36.821
But I ask only one thing.

01:39:39.355 --> 01:39:41.046
Please free him.

01:39:43.932 --> 01:39:45.142
Please?

01:39:46.365 --> 01:39:47.707
Please?

01:39:52.383 --> 01:39:53.910
Please. I'm begging you.

01:39:54.015 --> 01:39:55.739
Please.

01:39:57.472 --> 01:39:59.360
I will do anything.

01:40:05.283 --> 01:40:06.810
No! I want more than this!

01:40:08.516 --> 01:40:10.589
I want your heart.

01:40:11.557 --> 01:40:13.565
In your heart, please, give him up.

01:40:16.742 --> 01:40:18.336
If you free him.

01:40:25.673 --> 01:40:28.194
If I free him, you must never
see his face again.

01:40:34.252 --> 01:40:36.108
Swear it on your mother's name.

01:40:39.246 --> 01:40:40.555
I swear it.

01:40:55.987 --> 01:40:57.297
You're a lying whore!

01:40:57.396 --> 01:41:01.226
Jai Kumar will die!
And I will watch him die!

01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:31.862
Sahib!

01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:34.231
Sahib.

01:41:34.848 --> 01:41:36.375
A box was left at the gate

01:41:36.479 --> 01:41:38.302
with a message from the shah.

01:41:39.841 --> 01:41:41.751
He... he has entered
our kingdom, sahib.

01:41:41.858 --> 01:41:44.062
His troops are advancing upon us.

01:41:59.975 --> 01:42:01.317
Vazir.

01:42:08.362 --> 01:42:09.639
Call the Queen! Uhh... uhh...

01:42:41.909 --> 01:42:42.956
Comfort me.

01:42:54.937 --> 01:42:56.693
I need some comfort.

01:44:28.055 --> 01:44:29.364
Maya!

01:44:50.654 --> 01:44:52.313
Knowing love,

01:44:52.414 --> 01:44:55.481
I will allow all things
to come and go...

01:44:55.583 --> 01:44:57.078
to be as supple as the wind...

01:44:58.112 --> 01:45:02.369
and take everything
that comes with great courage.

01:45:02.465 --> 01:45:04.408
As Rasa would say to me:

01:45:05.314 --> 01:45:07.770
"Life is right in any case."

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.348
My heart is as open as the sky.
