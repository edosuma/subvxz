<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.170
             (boom)

00:06.540 --> 00:08.340
           (exhales)

00:08.342 --> 00:09.775
You experienced things
today

00:09.777 --> 00:11.110
     You don't understand.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.511
       <i> Nothing is random.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.279
   <i> Nothing is a coincidence.</i>

00:14.281 --> 00:16.782
    <i> Everything is happening</i>
         <i> for a reason.</i>

00:16.784 --> 00:19.351
 <i> And you have an important part</i>
            <i> to play.</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:20.719
               You're gonna kill
                 me, aren't you?

00:20.720 --> 00:22.086
                  Three shots to
               the chest, right?

00:22.089 --> 00:24.790
           (gunshots)

00:24.792 --> 00:25.724
            (crying)

00:32.665 --> 00:34.800
           (grunting)

00:37.371 --> 00:38.404

00:38.406 --> 00:39.138

00:44.045 --> 00:45.677
Erin:
What are you...
            (grunts)

00:45.679 --> 00:48.047
                  You stay calm,
                 you stay quiet.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.314
             I just need a ride.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.150
                   And then i'll
                     let you go.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.555
          He's alive.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.689
      I can tell you where

00:57.691 --> 00:59.258
               To find your son.
                   You just need

00:59.260 --> 01:02.227
 To finish a job for me first.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.063
 <i> She's already basically dead.</i>

01:04.065 --> 01:06.298
 <i> Killing her would be a mercy.</i>

01:07.168 --> 01:09.234
        (steady beeping)

01:38.699 --> 01:40.766
The man:
Don't stop now, vera.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.802
        You're so close.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.506
    I can't kill this woman.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.740
         But you must.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.410
              No.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.478
              You want her dead,

01:52.480 --> 01:53.879
       Kill her yourself.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.681
   That's not how this works.

01:55.683 --> 01:59.284
      How... How-how am i
    even supposed to be sure

01:59.286 --> 02:01.186
     That you have my son?

02:02.223 --> 02:04.356
            (squeak)

02:04.358 --> 02:07.593
 Are we gonna go on a airplane?

02:07.595 --> 02:10.762
          (squeaking)
            (cooing)

02:10.764 --> 02:13.298
Now we just need to tire you out
 so you sleep on the airplane.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.299
           (chuckles)

02:14.301 --> 02:16.235

               Easy now.

02:56.544 --> 03:00.279
          I don't have your son.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.882
 But i know exactly where he is.

03:03.884 --> 03:07.186
               So you can finish
          what you started or...

03:07.188 --> 03:09.454
     As god is my witness,

03:09.456 --> 03:12.925
   You will never see michael
             again.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.928
                 (crying softly)

03:15.930 --> 03:18.197
                      (sniffles)

03:29.610 --> 03:31.677
           (quietly):
             Sorry.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.350
       (inhales sharply)

03:38.352 --> 03:40.452

  <i> Niciodata fumanisa ceteros.</i>

04:10.017 --> 04:13.018
                         I don't
                     understand.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.753
     You were in a c-coma.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.021
           How long?

04:16.023 --> 04:17.623
         S-seven years.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.458
            (gasps)

04:24.531 --> 04:26.465
   You came here to kill me,
          didn't you?
                             No.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.467
 He wanted me to. I-i couldn't.
         I couldn't...

04:28.469 --> 04:29.334
        And you didn't.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.337
 That's all that matters, vera.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.905
      H-how do you know my name?
    Do you know who that man is?

04:33.907 --> 04:34.906
  Look, i need to find my son.

04:34.908 --> 04:35.741
      We have to go, okay?

04:35.743 --> 04:38.510
        (alarms beeping)

04:43.851 --> 04:46.051
             What are you doing?

04:46.053 --> 04:48.987
     I need to get him out
      of the car, sweetie.
But he doesn't

04:48.989 --> 04:50.055
            Look good. You can't
                  just leave him

04:50.057 --> 04:51.957
At a bus stop.
                    Amy, please.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.426
            He just wants to get
         to his brother's house.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.995
         Amy.
                 Mom, please.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.665
We should take him
to the hospital.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.960
            Joshua:
          At 4:10 p.M.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.896
   Today, on live television,

05:30.898 --> 05:34.433
  I, joshua silburn jr., died.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.701
       And yet here i am.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.702
              Why?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.103
          Joshua sr.:
        He may be strong

05:38.105 --> 05:42.574
   In spirit, but my poor son
        thinks he died.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.444
    And he's just not right
          in his mind.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.446
        And i apologize

05:47.448 --> 05:50.115
   For his disturbing and...

05:50.117 --> 05:52.584
     Unacceptable conduct.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.988
    We just pray he gets all
 the help he desperately needs.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.057
      (indistinct chatter)
        (elevator dings)

06:12.005 --> 06:14.005
            Driver:
       <i> Hey, kid. Wake up.</i>

06:14.007 --> 06:16.007
     <i> This is my last stop.</i>

06:16.009 --> 06:18.076
        End of the road.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.433
          (error beep)

06:45.406 --> 06:46.838
   Come on. Are you serious?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.790
        (steady beeping)

07:04.792 --> 07:07.659
What's his name?

07:07.661 --> 07:10.195
                     Uh, i don't
                 know, actually.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.632
               Come on, sweetie.
   Uh,

07:13.634 --> 07:15.500
    Whoa. What's your name?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.068
        Why do you need to know?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.870
        He's been shot.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.639
I'm required
by law to report

07:20.641 --> 07:21.940
      All gunshot wounds.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.009
Don't go anywhere.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.948
       Are we in trouble?
                    No, sweetie.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.117
       We're not. Come on. Let's
          get out of here, okay?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.952
        No. Hey, mister,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.620
      You got to wake up.
                     Amy...

07:39.893 --> 07:42.527
 You brought me to a hospital?
              Yeah, you're lucky

07:42.529 --> 07:43.995
                      It isn't a
                 police station.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.965
    No. No.
           Oh, my...
Mom!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.700
            (grunts)

08:05.018 --> 08:07.185
 What the hell did you just do?

08:08.722 --> 08:10.889
         We have an unidentified
               gunshot victim...

08:10.891 --> 08:12.691
(indistinct police transmission)

08:12.693 --> 08:14.092
            Come on.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.501
You, stop!
Wait!
Come back here!

08:23.270 --> 08:27.172
            Joshua:
Heavenly father, please help me.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.908
     I've lost everything.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.977
         Is dad right?

08:33.179 --> 08:36.615
      Am i out of my mind?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.683
   Or are these visions real?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.889
          Please, god.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.959
Help me to understand your plan.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.173
            (clack)

09:16.723 --> 09:18.924
You're the woman from my vision.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.892
           Yes, i am.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.161
           And you...

09:23.163 --> 09:24.763
      Are the messengers.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.336
We're the what?
        We're the angels
       of the apocalypse.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.344
 Guys, a little something that
 she's neglecting to mention--

09:39.346 --> 09:41.680
        She just woke up
    from a seven-year coma.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.048
            (sighs)

09:45.152 --> 09:47.752
                No, wait, peter.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.890
                   Joshua. Raul.

09:51.892 --> 09:55.827
               Erin. What vera's
            telling you is true.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.295
  But yesterday you all died.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.797
           And now here you are.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.367
Okay, sweetie, you want
to play a little game, okay?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.736
You mean, i'm not going crazy?

10:04.738 --> 10:07.305
       Something's really
  happening here, am i right?

10:07.307 --> 10:11.343
         God is angry,
   so he's giving us a test.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.645
  I am so not down with that.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.846
     Well, you'd better be,

10:14.848 --> 10:16.848
    Because this is prophecy
      we're talking about.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.185
You mean the book of revelation?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.786
        Different religions call
            it different things,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.888
            But god's message is
            pretty much the same

10:23.890 --> 10:25.323
                   No matter how
                   you slice it.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.793
     This is the beginning
          of the end.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.262
        You need to stop
        wasting my time.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.697
You said you'd give me answers.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.699
  You tell me where the man is
        who took my son.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.202
                 That is no man.
                He is the devil.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.837
      Wait. You mean like
        the devil devil?

10:38.839 --> 10:39.971
                     You thought

10:39.973 --> 10:41.740
        It was a meteor,
       but that was satan

10:41.742 --> 10:43.141
        Being cast down
    from heaven once again.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.843
      Hi. I'm an atheist.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.778
             You shouldn't doubt
           the devil's presence.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.813
 He's a wicked son of a bitch.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.749
                And he will play
               on every last one

10:50.751 --> 10:52.117
             Of your worst fears
               and insecurities.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.719
       You of all people
       should know that.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.054
   What is she talking about?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.689
       It doesn't matter.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.823
I'm calling the cops.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.991
                       It's been
                    seven years.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.127
                Have they helped
               you find michael?

11:02.129 --> 11:05.363
      We're the only hope
 you have of finding your son.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.867
        (loud, piercing
       rhythmic beeping)

11:08.869 --> 11:11.136
                     Oh, my god.
                   Where is she?

11:11.138 --> 11:13.438
          Code yellow!
  We've got a missing patient!

11:13.440 --> 11:15.440
             Erin:
   <i> Okay, even if any of this</i>

11:15.442 --> 11:17.409
    Was remotely legitimate,

11:17.411 --> 11:18.910
Why us?

11:18.912 --> 11:21.146
 If people like us can somehow
        figure out a way

11:21.148 --> 11:23.348
    To work together, maybe
the world deserves to be saved.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.316
    Saved from what exactly?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.918
          The rapture.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.919
               When god reclaims

11:27.921 --> 11:29.087
          The faithful

11:29.089 --> 11:31.322
And leaves the forsaken behind.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.992
    But how are we supposed
  to stop something like that?

11:33.994 --> 11:36.861
            By using the special
              gifts he has given

11:36.863 --> 11:38.296
           All of us.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.799
              The power to heal,

11:40.801 --> 11:42.901
            Incredible strength,
                      an ability

11:42.903 --> 11:44.302
               To hear thoughts,

11:44.304 --> 11:47.072
                 And the gift of
               prophetic vision.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.442
  Apparently, i'm the only one
    with the gift of sanity.

11:50.444 --> 11:53.411
  Your gift will reveal itself
       when you're ready.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.047
Right. That makes perfect sense.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.482
        What about you?
                         God has

11:57.484 --> 11:59.350
       Given me the gift
       of understanding.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.152
   Yeah. Understanding what?

12:01.154 --> 12:04.489
       (speaking spanish)

12:04.491 --> 12:05.957
       What did she say?

12:05.959 --> 12:08.226
        She understands
   whatever god wants her to.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.028
In every language known to man.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.832
Okay, well,
understand this.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.000
You need
medical attention.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.869
And you three are crazy

12:17.871 --> 12:18.970
           If you believe a word

12:18.972 --> 12:20.305
 That she is saying, and you...

12:20.307 --> 12:22.173
I know who you are.
You're a bible-thumper

12:22.175 --> 12:24.109
Who probably believes
everything that she's...

12:24.111 --> 12:25.910
    (joshua breathes loudly)

12:25.912 --> 12:26.978
                    What's wrong
                       with him?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.513
     He's having a seizure.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.181
   No. He's having a vision.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.417
       (breathing loudly)

12:32.419 --> 12:36.154
         (wind howling)

12:37.758 --> 12:40.024
    Come on! Come on, baby!

12:40.026 --> 12:42.227
         Come on. Yeah!

12:45.398 --> 12:49.968
(indistinct voices of children)

12:51.905 --> 12:53.972
   (loud, gasping breathing)

12:56.009 --> 12:57.275
     Tell us what you saw.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.344
Nurse:
Search every room in this wing

12:59.346 --> 13:01.112
           And check the chapel.

13:05.519 --> 13:06.985
             There's no escaping

13:06.987 --> 13:09.420
            Destiny.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.357
Rose.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.025
        It's a miracle.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.027
        (both laughing)

13:16.029 --> 13:18.029
              Hi.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.532
           (laughing)

13:25.939 --> 13:28.006
      (indistinct chatter)

13:32.879 --> 13:34.946
Get in the car, sweetie.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.517
       Get in. Up front.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.020
You sure?
                           Yeah.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.188
            What if she's right?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.522
          What if we're supposed
              to stick together?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.591
             I mean, i must have
        healed you for a reason.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.231
 What the hell am i doing here?

13:53.233 --> 13:56.267
        (phone ringing)

13:58.338 --> 14:01.272
              Hey.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.575
 Please tell me you're in cabo
      doing tequila shots.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.211
        (laughs) i wish.
     That's not happening.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.913
     Yeah, well, you picked
    a good day to skip work,

14:08.915 --> 14:10.448
      'cause we're fired.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.617
    I'm... I'm sorry. What?

14:12.619 --> 14:15.086
         You heard me.
We're locked out of our offices.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.388
No more labs, no more analysis,
        no more nothing.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.957
          Why? Is this

14:18.959 --> 14:20.091
     Because of the crater?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.226
  I wish i could tell you, v.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.327
       But you know what?
      The guys with guns--

14:22.329 --> 14:25.864
     They really don't feel
         like talking.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.632
         Thanks, guys.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.334
             Vera:
    Just tell me this much.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.969
      Did you get the rock
         from my house?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.103
             Yeah.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.989
        Yeah, i got it.

14:33.990 --> 14:35.874
    But what are we supposed
       to do with it now?

14:35.876 --> 14:38.076
  Don't worry. I'm on my way.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.979
          (dial tone)
             okay.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.581
        (engine revving,
        tires squealing)

14:45.886 --> 14:47.018
            (gasps)

14:47.020 --> 14:48.253
        I saw your son!

14:48.255 --> 14:50.321
           (panting)

14:58.164 --> 15:01.232
          So, why did you have a
         gun in the first place?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.468
            (sighs)
      i'm a federal agent.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.887
But i got framed, and now

15:05.888 --> 15:08.305
  There's all kinds of people
        looking for me.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.575
Sorry i got you caught up in it.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.945
 It's just par for the course,
            i guess.

15:13.947 --> 15:18.149
    It's been a pretty weird
        couple of days.

15:18.151 --> 15:21.152
    Yeah, tell me about it.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.409
Look, i don't want

15:22.410 --> 15:23.665
    To be any more trouble,
       so would you mind

15:23.666 --> 15:24.921
Just dropping me off
at my brother's?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.190
                        Sure.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.425
  Can i play with your niece?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.093
 Well, it's been a little while

15:29.095 --> 15:30.295
 Since i've seen her, sunshine.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.629
            Amy, we're gonna let

15:31.631 --> 15:33.264
      Raul spend some time
      with his own family.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.300
                           Okay?

15:39.606 --> 15:42.540
        (siren blaring)

15:42.542 --> 15:44.609
       (tires squeaking,
        engine revving)

15:45.545 --> 15:47.412
          Oh, my god.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.380
                   What do i do?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.282
      Just give me my gun
         and stay cool.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.651
           (panting)

15:53.653 --> 15:55.420
           Stay cool.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.723
         (siren toots)

15:59.726 --> 16:02.160
      (gun chamber clicks)

16:11.604 --> 16:13.471
       (car door closes)

16:13.473 --> 16:16.240
  (garbled radio transmission,
         birds singing)

16:17.610 --> 16:19.610
      (high-pitched tone)

16:19.612 --> 16:21.312
        Erin (echoing):
          <i> Oh, my god,</i>
       <i> we are so screwed.</i>

16:21.314 --> 16:24.215
        <i> Please don't let</i>
        <i> ronnie find us.</i>

16:24.217 --> 16:27.618
              Amy:
       <i> I don't want daddy</i>
      <i> to hurt mom anymore.</i>

16:27.620 --> 16:30.288
 (high-pitched, piercing tone)

16:30.290 --> 16:32.490
              Cop:
       <i> This is the bitch</i>
     <i> from the amber alert.</i>

16:32.492 --> 16:35.360
      <i> I'm gonna run her in</i>
        <i> for kidnapping.</i>

16:39.599 --> 16:41.766
Both of you,
step out of the car slowly.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.668
       <i> This is the bitch</i>
     <i> from the amber alert.</i>

16:43.670 --> 16:45.336
             Erin:
        <i> Please don't let</i>
        <i> ronnie find us.</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:47.338
              Amy:
       <i> I don't want daddy</i>
      <i> to hurt mom anymore.</i>

16:47.340 --> 16:49.774
           (grunting)

16:49.776 --> 16:52.310
      (gun chamber clicks)
don't move.

16:54.180 --> 16:58.116
        (engine revving)

16:58.118 --> 17:00.518
             You realize we just
     assaulted a police officer?

17:00.520 --> 17:04.255
    Like you said, it's been
    a weird couple of days.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.455
              (sighs)
by the way,

17:05.458 --> 17:07.392
         Who's ronnie?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.426
                    Did you just
                   read my mind?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.194
  Apparently, i hear thoughts.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.564
   You mean... Every thought?

17:13.566 --> 17:15.700
   No, only the crappy ones.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.268
Well, what kind of gift is that?

17:17.270 --> 17:19.470
Kept you out of jail, didn't it?

17:19.472 --> 17:22.640
 I guess we're both on the run.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.111
        (phone ringing)

17:32.152 --> 17:34.685
             Hello?

17:34.687 --> 17:36.487
             Alice:
 Peter. Thank god you answered.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.289
         Where are you?
     You need to come home.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.490
            I can't.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.092
  I'm guilty of murder, alice.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.294
       No, peter, listen.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.363
    I talked to the police,
   and sam's friend id'd you,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.065
But i told them i was there when

17:47.067 --> 17:48.299
   He threatened to kill you.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.501
           They know
 that it was just self-defense.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.804
      All they want to do
        is talk to you.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.305
         You can still

17:54.307 --> 17:55.840
    Clear your name, peter.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.708
    There's some crazy stuff
           happening.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.446
I think i need to figure it out
      before i come home.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.847
I'm worried
about you.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.549
Please be
careful.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.219
      I-i will. I promise.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.221
 Check in with you later, okay?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.223
    Okay.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.492
    Bye.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.494
                        We good?

18:16.496 --> 18:19.197
  (computer trilling, beeping)

18:19.199 --> 18:21.099
           (trilling)

18:21.101 --> 18:23.101
                      Thanks for
                      your help.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.770
                     You did the
                    right thing.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.346
       (tires squealing)
♪ raised up in the country... ♪

18:35.348 --> 18:37.348
                   Where exactly

18:37.350 --> 18:39.250
             Did you see my son?
In my vision.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.552
Oh, god.
               You don't get it.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.687
I've had these visions before.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.255
I saw rose, and i found rose.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.557
I'm not just some preacher man
off the rails.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.726
Forget the gossip.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.361
We're talking
about the gospel.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.630
And god has every reason
to be angry at us.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.016
School shootings,
the financial crisis.

18:55.017 --> 18:57.401
 Global warming. The world has
 gone to hell in a handbasket.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.303
         Are you trying to sound
        ass-hat crazy right now?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.205
            The reasons kids get
              shot in schools is

19:01.207 --> 19:02.673
   Because psychos have guns.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.908
        You want to talk
       financial crisis?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.910
   Look up sub-prime lending.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.911
           And don't even get me
      started on global warming.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.215
     You might not like it,

19:10.216 --> 19:12.517
But this has all been predicted.
           Are you gonna tell me
              where we're headed

19:12.519 --> 19:14.886
       Or am i just going
      to drive aimlessly?
Got to be around here somewhere.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.654
      I recognized it from
   when my church used to do

19:16.656 --> 19:17.788
          Charity work
     in this neighborhood.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.657
        Recognized what?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.425
         That.

19:21.427 --> 19:22.593
Hey, stop the truck.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.471
If you want to find your son...

19:33.473 --> 19:35.540
      Follow me.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.583
So, what, we're just gonna start
     knocking on random people's

19:45.585 --> 19:47.785
                 Doors?
It's the house
i saw in my vision.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.754
         No. Look, this
         is ridiculous.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.956
         We have to go.
         This is crazy.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.425
          Good afternoon, ma'am.
You'd better not
be from the bank.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.861
I told y'all that...
                    No, we're
                  from a charity

19:56.863 --> 19:58.563
              Devoted to helping
               wounded veterans.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.931
                  I... You know,
                  i'm-i'm sorry,

19:59.933 --> 20:01.499
Ma'am, i think my friend
  has the wrong house.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.800
                   No, we don't.
Wait, wait.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.802
       Is this about ben?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.671
         He's not home.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.507
            Is ben your husband?
          He was wounded, right?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.445
Lost an arm

20:14.447 --> 20:16.347
                 For his country
                 in afghanistan.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.885
Now we can't
even make the rent.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.821
               He's out of work?
Not for lack of trying.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.590
   But it's tough out there.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.960
He was supposed to work
for senator richards...

20:28.962 --> 20:30.695
Till some lackey boy of hers

20:30.697 --> 20:33.331
Said he wasn't fit
for security detail.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.367
         I'm sorry to hear that.
Ben is a proud warrior.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.971
But if you ask me, he shouldn't
have to keep fighting

20:39.973 --> 20:42.873
Here at home.
                  Any idea where
                      he is now?

20:44.644 --> 20:47.011
I wish to god i could tell you.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.347
It's him, vera. He's
the guy i saw in my vision.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.549
I saw him on that porch.
I saw him at the race track.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.017
I saw him
talking to us at the park.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.585
And then you know
what else i saw?

20:54.587 --> 20:57.021
You. With your son in your arms.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.856
   Why are you doing this to me?

20:58.858 --> 21:01.359
'cause somehow
it's all connected.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.394
I think that's what
god's trying to tell us.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.764
         I don't believe in god.
       I don't believe in angels

21:06.766 --> 21:09.467
             And i don't believe
             in the devil, okay?

21:09.469 --> 21:12.003
Do you believe
your son is alive?

21:13.840 --> 21:16.574
         (bell ringing)

21:16.576 --> 21:17.708
           Announcer:
     And they're deadlocked

21:17.710 --> 21:19.377
      At the eighth pole.
         He's a slicky

21:19.379 --> 21:22.046
     Has ground in the lead
   by this journeyman jockey.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.652

it's he's a slicky in the lead.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.792
        (laughs, whoops)

21:40.900 --> 21:43.467
 Trifecta, baby. You see that?

21:43.469 --> 21:44.735
           Lucky you.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.737
           Oh, yeah.
           Oh, yeah.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.308
              Hey.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.443
          You're a chess player.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.478
         How'd you like
     to double your money?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.647
              Hmm.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.627
  This is the place.
                    That's where
                    your brother

22:09.629 --> 22:12.063
             Lives?
Yup. I got to make sure

22:12.065 --> 22:13.397
           He's okay.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.070
   Thanks a lot.
                   Sure.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.539
       It's... Been interesting.

22:21.541 --> 22:25.509
              Do you have to go?
Afraid so, sunshine.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.844
     But maybe i'll see you
        again sometime.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.816
           All right.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.625
     I like him.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.027
         I know you do, sweetie.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.096
       You like him, too.

22:45.098 --> 22:48.099

24:18.558 --> 24:20.925
                Dad was watching

24:52.825 --> 24:53.924

24:53.926 --> 24:55.726

took him?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.628
      That's a long story,

24:57.630 --> 24:59.830

25:08.541 --> 25:10.274
I'm not going anywhere with you.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.588
That vet has to be
around somewhere.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.290
I saw him
right here.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.092
        Well, we tried.
           I'm sorry,

25:28.094 --> 25:30.127
    I can't do this anymore.
Wait, you
can't leave.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.996
Look, what if rose
is right?

25:31.998 --> 25:34.298
If these really are
prophetic visions i'm having,

25:34.299 --> 25:36.599
There must be a reason we're
supposed to find this vet.
                      That woman

25:36.602 --> 25:38.168
               Just woke up from
              a seven-year coma.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.271
         And you have completely
                 lost your grip.

25:40.273 --> 25:42.740
       I'm an idiot for thinking
     you could actually help me.
There's more

25:42.742 --> 25:45.009

      the park, your son,

25:45.011 --> 25:47.144

   You need to come with me.

26:09.302 --> 26:11.735
This is your fault,
isn't it? You

26:11.737 --> 26:14.772
     Screw up and then they
    come after your family?

26:15.808 --> 26:17.908
She seems pretty smart.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.109
Too bad you're not.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.778
We knew you'd come back.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.112
      Where's my brother?
Why don't you

26:22.114 --> 26:26.183
          Come with me
   and ask el jefe yourself.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.920
           All right,

26:29.922 --> 26:31.121
You let her go...

26:31.123 --> 26:32.256
    And i'm gonna come with you.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.028

26:47.340 --> 26:48.872

26:49.609 --> 26:52.343

27:10.830 --> 27:12.863
  Now you gonna come with me?

27:43.195 --> 27:46.363
       When my brave son
sacrificed his life in the war,

27:46.365 --> 27:49.066
       I knew i couldn't
   let his death be in vain.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.968
 So i committed myself to doing

27:50.970 --> 27:54.405
   Exactly what he and these
     selfless veterans did,

27:54.407 --> 27:56.740
    Trying to make my state

27:56.742 --> 27:59.810

    How exactly did you lose it?

28:25.838 --> 28:27.905
                Your arm?

28:32.311 --> 28:35.112
      I was riding shotgun
    in a humvee in kandahar.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.448
We drove right over an ied.

28:37.450 --> 28:40.184
     And boom. That was it.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.386
Woke up in a hospital,

28:42.388 --> 28:45.989
  And my best friend was dead.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.991
        I bet that's not
       the kind of thing

28:47.993 --> 28:49.993
      You get over easily.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.462
Well,

28:51.464 --> 28:55.232
     Some days are tougher
          than others.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.768

   he was the bravest s.O.B.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.840
I ever knew.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.342
    And, uh, he didn't have
          to be there.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.045
      Really? Why is that?

29:08.047 --> 29:10.114
  He was the son of a senator.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.381
                      A senator.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.784
           Of course.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.086
     That makes more sense.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.455
         It's not you.

29:18.457 --> 29:22.292
           It's what
    you could lead them to.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.194
  That's why you're important.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.964
         What the hell
     are you talking about?

29:26.966 --> 29:30.234
                       You know,

29:30.235 --> 29:33.503
  I've been fighting a battle of
    my own for a very long time.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.506
  And i've been wounded, too.

29:35.508 --> 29:38.442
          Oh, really?

29:42.014 --> 29:44.782
   Take today, for instance.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.351
     I was this close to...

29:47.353 --> 29:49.353
    Snuffing out a problem,

29:49.355 --> 29:51.889
                      Only to be
                    stopped dead

29:51.891 --> 29:53.423
         In my tracks.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.825
    But if there's one thing

29:54.827 --> 29:56.393
  I've learned over the years,
           it's that

29:56.395 --> 30:00.430
           Sometimes
you have to shift your strategy.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.566
       You put your pawns
    in the right positions.

30:02.568 --> 30:06.336
     You let them sacrifice
          themselves.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.838
                            Then

30:07.840 --> 30:10.240
                   You pick your
                   opponents off

30:10.242 --> 30:13.043
          One by one.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.279
         You get close.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.114
    You get in their heads.

30:20.052 --> 30:23.587
       And if you really
         want to win...

30:23.589 --> 30:26.089
      You make them think
         you're losing.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.034
Then, when they least expect it,

30:37.036 --> 30:39.603
       You go for blood.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.042
           Checkmate.

30:47.513 --> 30:51.515
  I guess you should have quit
     while you were ahead.

31:02.094 --> 31:05.295
                           Damn.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.264
       What are you gonna
        tell your wife?

31:17.610 --> 31:19.877
         (loud panting)

31:36.495 --> 31:39.263
      Hey, alan, i swear,
    i'm on my way back now.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.964
             Alan:
      Well, don't bother.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.366
What do you mean, don't bother?

31:42.368 --> 31:44.101
      Remember the crater?

31:44.103 --> 31:46.336
         Smoking rock,
   giant hole in the ground?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.305
   Helicopters, bunch of guys
     in camo? That crater?

31:48.307 --> 31:49.640
      Yes, of course. Why?

31:49.642 --> 31:52.242
     Yeah, well, it's gone.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.510
       (brakes squeaking)

31:53.512 --> 31:55.345
    Wait. Alan, alan, stop.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.014
  What do you mean, it's gone?

31:57.016 --> 31:59.249
     I mean <i> gone</i> gone, like
  government conspiracy gone.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.218
            Area 51,

32:01.220 --> 32:04.354
          18
    of watergate tapes gone.
 Don't know what i'm gonna do.

32:04.356 --> 32:07.658
 Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Wait!

32:07.660 --> 32:09.393
                            Ben:
                         He took
               everything i had.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.460
          Everything.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.563
Hey!

32:13.565 --> 32:14.631
Hey, look out!

32:14.633 --> 32:15.632
Wait!

32:19.004 --> 32:21.004
Oh, my...

32:21.006 --> 32:24.007
            My god.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.115
            (gasps)

32:32.117 --> 32:33.183
          Oh, my god.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.458
      (crickets chirping)

32:41.460 --> 32:43.527
  (rock music plays on radio)

32:49.201 --> 32:51.668
(sighs)

32:51.670 --> 32:55.973
I'm sorry.
Can't hear myself think.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.109
   So, where did your mom go?

32:59.111 --> 33:01.578
             Nadia:
   <i> Wouldn't you like to know?</i>

33:01.580 --> 33:06.316
      She and dad split up
      a couple years ago.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.118
    Then she moved to tulsa.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.119
         What happened?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.021
       What do you care?

33:11.023 --> 33:13.056
   <i> It was your fault anyway.</i>

33:13.058 --> 33:15.459
        <i> Now you're just</i>
     <i> gonna get dad killed.</i>

33:15.461 --> 33:18.128
  Listen, nadia, i'm not gonna
    let them hurt your dad.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.435
        (music playing)

33:25.437 --> 33:29.072

     squealing and hissing)

33:29.074 --> 33:30.207
           Pull over.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.645
           In my vision i saw us
            talking to that vet.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.380
               And if you'd have

34:15.721 --> 34:17.320
You don't know that it isn't.

            been given anything.

34:29.802 --> 34:33.437
God has a plan, vera.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.172
            Did his plan include
        someone stealing my son?

35:09.675 --> 35:11.174
Yes, and i don't think

35:11.176 --> 35:13.844
    Any of us has a choice.

35:13.846 --> 35:16.246
    We need to find and stop

35:16.248 --> 35:18.315
       The four horsemen
       of the apocalypse.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.450
      Seriously? Horsemen?

35:20.452 --> 35:21.585
        She's talking about war,

35:21.587 --> 35:25.522
 Pestilence, famine and death.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.556
That doesn't sound good.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.458
           It isn't.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.359
  But they're regular people,
       just like we are.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.462
        Except the devil
    is tempting each of them

35:32.464 --> 35:33.830
      To commit some kind
        of terrible sin,

35:33.832 --> 35:35.799
       And once they do,
    they're no longer human.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.235
 They've broken a fateful seal.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.704
                 The seven seals
              of the apocalypse.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.173
That sounds even worse.
                          It is.

35:43.175 --> 35:44.574
   Each of the seals is like
        a stepping stone

35:44.576 --> 35:45.909
   On the way to the rapture.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.410
     Can we just slow down
         for a second?

35:47.412 --> 35:49.062
      I just came in here

35:49.063 --> 35:50.713
  To get some chicken nuggets
       with my daughter.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.549
Yeah, i've got somebody waiting
          in the car.
         I just woke up

35:52.551 --> 35:53.650
     From a seven-year coma

35:53.652 --> 35:55.402
And found out my fiancé
stopped visiting

35:55.403 --> 35:57.153
       After six months,
  so spare me your sob stories

35:57.156 --> 35:58.388
     And listen carefully.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.158
          If those four horsemen

36:01.160 --> 36:02.492
Succeed in breaking their seals,

36:02.494 --> 36:04.828
        We can all kiss
       humanity good-bye.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.765
       There was a one-armed vet
                   in my vision.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.768
     Then she and i saw him
          get killed.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.236
 Could he have been a horseman?

36:13.238 --> 36:14.337
If you found him

36:14.339 --> 36:16.473
            In time,
  maybe he could've helped us.

36:20.612 --> 36:21.928
        A one-armed vet.

36:21.929 --> 36:23.245
     I saw a guy like that
       in a campaign ad.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.916
 Then he must have been a piece
         of the puzzle.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.285
     God shows us all signs
           every day.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.586
          Between that
     and joshua's visions,

36:29.588 --> 36:31.655
    It's up to the six of us
        to work together

36:31.657 --> 36:33.290
 And figure out what they mean.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.492
   I thought there were seven
   angels of the apocolypse?

36:35.494 --> 36:38.228
   There's one more to come,
       but we can't wait.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.396
        The end is near.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.864
 We have to stop the horsemen.

36:44.903 --> 36:48.672
Okay, i'm sure
you're all lovely people.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.373
(chuckles)
i've heard enough,

36:50.375 --> 36:52.275
And i only believe things
i can see.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.744
 Then you need to look harder.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.657
     That is really trippy.

37:19.972 --> 37:21.771
     (indistinct shouting)

37:25.978 --> 37:27.811
           (panting)

37:27.813 --> 37:29.512
           You okay?

37:33.785 --> 37:35.418
       What did you see?

37:35.420 --> 37:36.519
           Dog tags.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.389
             Sword.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.260
          Blood, fire.

37:46.331 --> 37:48.832
Sounds like the horseman of war.
