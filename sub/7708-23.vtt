WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.902
[ALF chuckles]

00:03.904 --> 00:07.006
Yes. Yes. Park Place is mine.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.575
That completes my empire.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.911
This isn't any fun.
You won everything.

00:12.913 --> 00:17.416
Just call me Harry Helmsley.
You could be Leona.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.885
Here. Here's a
"Get out of jail free" card.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.887
[laughs]

00:21.889 --> 00:23.722
[car approaching]

00:23.724 --> 00:27.760
ALF, I think
that's Robert and Lynn.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.695
When is she gonna get
over this guy?

00:29.697 --> 00:34.033
Why? Robert seems like
a very nice young man.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.503
Willie, he's a mime.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.072
That's how he's helping
to put himself through college.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.641
Hating mimes is the one thing
that could bring the world

00:42.643 --> 00:45.477
together in a common cause.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.413
Come on, Brian.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.086
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.721
Robert, nice to see you again.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.289
What did you two do all evening?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.992
Robert was teaching me
a movement in mime.

00:59.994 --> 01:02.094
- She's pretty good.
- Oh, really.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.662
What did you learn?

01:10.071 --> 01:12.471
Woman riding escalator.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.207
[Kate chuckles]
Very good, honey.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.676
And it can only get better.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.278
Well, I have to go.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.914
I have a self-defense class
for mimes in the morning.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.383
Night.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.288
I had an extraordinary time.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.823
But I told you that already.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.070
Goodnight.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.846
Ho-ho. You never kiss me
like that.

01:53.848 --> 01:56.748
What is it, the hair?
Because I could shave.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.820
[theme music]

02:31.519 --> 02:33.585
[music continues]

02:59.780 --> 03:01.947

03:05.219 --> 03:08.787
"Sodium citrate, citric acid

03:08.789 --> 03:12.791
malic acid, sulfuric acid."

03:12.793 --> 03:15.460
- Let me see that.
- Ha, ha!

03:15.462 --> 03:18.096
Gotcha on that last one.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.531
What is all that stuff?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.434
Didn't you have food additives
on Melmac?

03:22.436 --> 03:25.437
No. We had the odd rodent part

03:25.439 --> 03:28.140
but technically
that was a preservative.

03:28.142 --> 03:32.377
Oh, ALF. Come on, big guy.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.279
Time for bed.

03:34.281 --> 03:38.550
Now, my cousin, Freda,
she found an entire rat head

03:38.552 --> 03:40.719
although she shouldn't
have been surprised.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.555
She found it in a can of
rat head soup.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.127
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.662
How was the game?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.531
You'll never guess
what happened at half time.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.067
Everyone went home again?

03:55.069 --> 03:56.602
I won the raffle.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.970
So I sort of felt obligated

03:57.972 --> 03:59.504
to stay
for the rest of the game.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.107
Oh. That's great.
What did you win?

04:02.109 --> 04:06.878
An all-expense-paid weekend
for two at a ski resort.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.982
I'll go, but I'm not gonna cook.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.284
So who are you going to take?
Joanie?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.886
Oh, right. I'm taking Robert.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.956
- Robert?
- Yeah.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.992
In fact, we're gonna go
this weekend.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.793
I can't wait to get up
into the mountains

04:21.795 --> 04:25.230
and breathe all that fresh air,
go for long walks in the snow

04:25.232 --> 04:26.598
sit by the fire.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.402
Sip cheap wine out of a box.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.405
[sighs]
Lynn, I can't believe
you'd plan this kind of a trip

04:33.407 --> 04:35.507
without asking permission.

04:35.509 --> 04:39.444
Permission?
Mom, I'm 19.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.613
She has a point, if you ask me.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.282
No one's asking you.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.586
Okay, that's a point for you.
It's tied one-all.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.554
Get out.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.024
You didn't say, "Godzilla says."

04:53.560 --> 04:56.928
But perhaps I didn't hear.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.467
[sighs]
Okay, you may be 19

05:02.469 --> 05:04.102
but as long as you live
in this house--

05:04.104 --> 05:07.072
Oh, that is
such a mother thing to say.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.508
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.044
(ALF)
'Score another point for Lynn.'

05:12.046 --> 05:14.379
Look, I just don't think
it's right for you

05:14.381 --> 05:16.615
to go away for the weekend

05:16.617 --> 05:20.085
with someone you hardly know.
Okay?

05:20.087 --> 05:23.622
You hardly know him.
I happen to know him very well.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.224
I can't believe
you're acting like this.

05:26.226 --> 05:29.561
What's going on?
What did ALF do now?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.897
Ha. For once, you're wrong.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.166
I was merely being annoying.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.236
Would somebody care
to fill me in?

05:38.238 --> 05:40.639
Lynn won a raffle,
and apparently

05:40.641 --> 05:42.908
the winner gets to sleep
with Robert.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.678
Excuse me?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.980
Lynn won a weekend trip
to a ski resort.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.984
- 'I see.'
- She intends to take Robert.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.888
I'm sorry if you don't trust me,
but I'm going.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.662
Ooh!

06:03.664 --> 06:05.864
Hey, you want to know
what I think?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.434
'Apparently not.'

06:10.437 --> 06:12.904
[instrumental music]

06:19.246 --> 06:20.612

[clanking]

06:36.497 --> 06:38.964
[ALF burps]

06:38.966 --> 06:43.468
You know, I don't understand
why Lynn didn't just lie.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.404
Well, maybe that's your way, ALF

06:45.406 --> 06:47.005
but not everybody's like that.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.141
Well, it's a curse.

06:49.143 --> 06:53.245
Fortunately, I have
the boyish charm to pull it off.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.551
Coffee?
Dad, it's after 10 o'clock.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.821
I don't expect any of us will be
sleeping much tonight anyway.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.725
Oh, Willie,
our little girl's growing up.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.293
It seems just like yesterday

07:08.295 --> 07:11.797
she was wearing
her first training bra.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.432
Which raises the question..

07:13.434 --> 07:18.203
What can they do now
that they couldn't do before?

07:18.205 --> 07:21.506
- Get out.
- I haven't finished my snack.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.341
Your bowl is empty.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.044
The refrigerator isn't.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.479
Out.

07:29.316 --> 07:33.852
Lynn, you know, you could ease
this whole situation.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.688
How? By promising
nothing will happen

07:36.690 --> 07:38.824
that mom doesn't want to happen?

07:38.826 --> 07:42.294
Dad. You don't want me
to be a hypocrite.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.864
Well, I don't want to
rule out any options just yet.

07:48.235 --> 07:52.637
You guys raised me
to be able to think for myself.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.539
And to make the right decision.

07:54.541 --> 07:58.443
And so you have.
As far as I know.

07:58.445 --> 08:02.848
Then why does mom think I'm
gonna suddenly stop doing that?

08:02.850 --> 08:04.749
Well, I guess she wants to be
sure that

08:04.751 --> 08:09.754
your right decision is...right.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.990
That's not okay anymore.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.125
I don't want to make mom unhappy

08:14.127 --> 08:17.829
but if I make her a promise,
I want to keep it.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.933
And if situations occur

08:21.935 --> 08:24.503
and I'd have to break
that promise..

08:24.505 --> 08:27.138
Well, you see my point.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.373
Absolutely.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.275
Is this making you
uncomfortable?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.010
Absolutely.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.045
I'm glad we had this talk.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.550
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Abs..

08:39.720 --> 08:41.419
Goodnight.

08:43.557 --> 08:47.659
Willie, when it comes time
to have this talk with Brian

08:47.661 --> 08:49.461
I'll handle it.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.198
[instrumental music]

08:55.068 --> 08:57.469
I take it the trip is still on.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.004
It was never off.

08:59.006 --> 09:03.008
Good for you, Lynn.
Stick by your guns.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.044
ALF, please,
I've had enough for one day.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.579
Oh, chill out, huh?

09:08.949 --> 09:11.650
How long have you had this
down comforter?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.084
You can't have it.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.986
You're too materialistic.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.888
You should never
fall in love with anything

09:16.890 --> 09:19.057
that can't love you back.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.592
Ask your dad.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.764
Ah. Ah.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.133
- What are you doing?
- Ah.

09:28.135 --> 09:31.002
Any chance you'll get
snowed in up there?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.605
You can't have my room.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.407
Yeah, well,
what if I had a broken leg

09:35.409 --> 09:37.542
and couldn't get up
to the attic?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.544
You still couldn't have my room.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.946
Okay, okay.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.548
What if I had two broken legs

09:43.550 --> 09:46.151
and six months to live?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.453
Make it three months,
you got a deal.

09:48.455 --> 09:52.924
Ha! I would've settled
for two. Ha!

09:52.926 --> 09:55.427
So when do you go over the wall?

09:56.563 --> 09:58.096
First thing in the morning.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.499
I wish it didn't have to be
like this.

10:01.501 --> 10:07.138
Well, if it's any consolation,
I went through the same thing.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.040
Your mother didn't approve
of Rhonda?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.543
No. She had a reputation.

10:11.545 --> 10:14.646
She skied around.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.182
Of course, that's how we met.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.553
We won't go into that.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.154
[instrumental music]

10:26.226 --> 10:28.226
No, Brian, it's fine.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.896
Now, as soon as Lynn leaves,
I'm gonna yell, "Fire."

10:31.898 --> 10:33.531
While everyone runs
for their lives

10:33.533 --> 10:37.202
you move everything of mine
into Lynn's room.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.937
Does Lynn know about this?

10:38.939 --> 10:43.642
[chuckles]
Are you kidding?
It was her idea.

10:43.644 --> 10:48.813
- So can I count on you?
- No. I'm not so stupid anymore.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.383
Yeah, well, don't kid yourself.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.351
Brian. Brian.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.089
Kate, I was just bringing you
this.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.524
Oh, thanks, honey.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.593
You didn't get much sleep
last night, did you?

11:01.595 --> 11:02.794
No.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.396
Maybe you should switch to
decaf.

11:04.398 --> 11:05.930
[car horn honks]

11:05.932 --> 11:08.066
Robert just pulled up.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.537
Then you're determined
to go through with this.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.940
Yeah. I bet you never thought
you'd live to see

11:15.942 --> 11:18.476
your own daughter go off
to the mountains.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.145
[knock on door]

11:21.281 --> 11:23.515
- Good morning.
- Hi.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.450
Good morning, Mr. Tanner,
Mrs. Tanner.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.751
Robert.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.953
Guess what, when I called
the hotel to confirm

11:28.955 --> 11:30.822
they said they were giving us
a suite

11:30.824 --> 11:33.158
with a fireplace
and a hot tub.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.627
Isn't that great?

11:35.629 --> 11:37.495
What? What does that mean?

11:37.497 --> 11:40.665
Wait, wait, I should know this.
I'm a mime.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.334
It means you should have waited
in the car. Let's go.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.469
I see.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.105
Well, as we say
in the business..

Oh, they're here.
Honey, what am I going to do?

12:29.316 --> 12:32.684
I am so mad at myself
over the way I handled this.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.252
Or didn't handle this.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.087
She'll understand,
now that the two of you

12:36.089 --> 12:39.491
had a couple of days to relax.

12:39.493 --> 12:43.728
Lynn's probably so relaxed
she'll have to be wheeled in.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.066
May I suggest you shut up?

12:48.068 --> 12:51.703
And go clean your stuff
out of Lynn's room?

12:51.705 --> 12:54.572
You know, I still can't believe
she agreed to let you use it.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.875
Hey, I've got it right here
in writing.

12:56.877 --> 13:01.146
- That's your handwriting.
- It was dictated but not read.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.955
Oh, ALF.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.525
I'm sorry about the way I left.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.493
I talked it over with Robert.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.129
I don't want us to be angry
with each other.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.265
- Are we okay?
- Honey.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.300
Honey, let's just put it
all behind us.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.903
Oh, I'm for that.

13:24.905 --> 13:28.206
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi. Hi.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.842
So how was your trip?

13:30.844 --> 13:32.844
Yeah. How'd you make out?

13:32.846 --> 13:34.746
[chuckles]

13:34.748 --> 13:36.514
For heaven's sake.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.784
Oh, like you're not dying
to know.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.086
The sunsets were gorgeous.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.155
The snow was a pale blue

13:44.157 --> 13:47.358
and there were all these, these
fire torches from the ski patrol

13:47.360 --> 13:51.095
as they carried the injured
down off the bunny slope.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.666
Well, I-I'm glad
you had a good time.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.467
He is so neat.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.803
We talked about everything.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.372
Philosophy, music, books.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.942
He told me about his childhood,
his fears.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.510
And we thought
about the future

14:05.512 --> 14:08.446
what it would be like
to live together.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.382
Whoa. Back up.
Back up. Back up.

14:11.384 --> 14:15.687
I knew that was wrong the second
it came out of my mouth.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.190
I'm glad you realize
what a mistake it would be.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.528
That's not exactly what I said.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.530
You mean you talked to him
seriously

14:25.532 --> 14:28.299
about the two of you
living together?

14:28.301 --> 14:29.901
And what if we did?

14:29.903 --> 14:32.470
Uh, I have to agree
with your mother here, Lynn.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.874
Uh, that's just totally
out of the question.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.675
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

14:37.677 --> 14:42.146
Lynn, stay out of this.
I mean you s..

14:42.148 --> 14:44.449
Lynn, you're too young.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.852
Dad, some of my friends from
high school are married already.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.821
What would you do for money?

14:49.823 --> 14:52.223
Hey, she skis now.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.026
That's gotta be worth something.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.996
All I said was that we talked
about living together.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.598
- What's the big deal?
- Oh!

15:00.600 --> 15:03.201
Sweetheart, we just don't feel
you're ready

15:03.203 --> 15:05.670
to make this kind of decision.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.506
Maybe it's time we found out.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.049
Hey, you guys,
if it's any consolation

15:18.051 --> 15:20.251
I'll never leave you.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.321
[instrumental music]

15:29.763 --> 15:30.962
[whistling]

15:30.964 --> 15:32.363
[knock on door]

15:37.003 --> 15:38.670
Hey, what a surprise.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.539
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Are you kidding?

15:45.345 --> 15:46.611
[chuckles]

15:46.613 --> 15:49.414
We just left each other.
Going out already?

15:49.416 --> 15:53.685
Well, what can I say?
I'm a workaholic.

15:53.687 --> 15:58.122
Robert, remember that discussion
we had about us living together?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.657
Mm-hm.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.592
This would be a good time
for me.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.394
Oh.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.998
Uh-huh. Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.634
Well, I guess
I just dropped a bomb, didn't I?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.736
No, no, no.
It's, uh, it's-it's..

16:11.738 --> 16:13.538
You know,
we-we should talk about this.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.774
I mean, I'd, uh, I'd have to fix
up the apartment.

16:16.776 --> 16:20.611
Please, I can't take
all this affection.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.582
Honey, y-you know I'm crazy
about you.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.985
But not at sea level.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.121
It's just that
I thought we were talking about

16:30.123 --> 16:32.023
sometime in the, oh

16:32.025 --> 16:36.694
say, unspecified,
indeterminate future.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.797
Then what was all that talk
when we were in the mountains?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.265
Did you just think
I'm just some girl

16:41.267 --> 16:43.267
that needs to hear promises?

16:43.269 --> 16:45.570
What has your mother done now?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.506
I just mentioned that
we might eventually one day

16:48.508 --> 16:52.210
move in together
and she went nuts.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.078
Why did you have to say
anything at all?

16:54.080 --> 16:57.648
Because. Just because.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.219
Well, that's all the reason

17:01.221 --> 17:04.856
I need to start
our lives together.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.692
Okay.
Okay, I'll go back.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.061
I'll play Suzy Creamcheese
one more time

17:10.063 --> 17:12.864
but I won't promise to like it.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.365
Leave me something.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.134
You know,
it might not be so bad.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.835
You'd be doing what she wants.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.638
She's just gonna think
that you're incredibly mature.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.775
Yeah, she wants me to be mature.

17:23.777 --> 17:27.111
She just doesn't want me
to grow up. Thanks.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.385
[instrumental music]

17:39.692 --> 17:41.592
Have I thanked you lately
for driving

17:41.594 --> 17:43.761
your daughter out of the house?

17:43.763 --> 17:46.898
Can you try to have
a little compassion?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.934
This has been a very
upsetting weekend for us.

17:49.936 --> 17:53.871
I resent that.
I care deeply for Lynn.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.276
You're not thinking of
moving back, are you?

17:58.278 --> 18:02.180
Tenant protection laws
are very strict in this state.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.581
ALF.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.951
Dad, can I speak to mom alone?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.154
Of course.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.961
ALF, get out.

18:16.963 --> 18:21.332
What is this? All I hear lately
is "ALF, get out."

18:21.334 --> 18:22.967
What do you want?

18:22.969 --> 18:25.103
(both)
Get out.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.672
Fine. Just say so.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.713
Mom, I admit
I shouldn't have left like that.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.685
That's one thing
we're both able to agree on.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.488
I just don't think that
I have to ask your permission

18:43.490 --> 18:45.089
for everything I do anymore.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.024
Well, at least we should be
able to discuss it

18:47.026 --> 18:48.659
so I can force you
to change your mind

18:48.661 --> 18:50.461
if I disagree with you.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.829
[Lynn scoffs]

18:51.831 --> 18:55.099
Mom, I'm not
your little girl anymore.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.501
You're going to have to trust me

18:56.503 --> 18:59.270
to be able to make my own
mistakes.

18:59.272 --> 19:03.074
Well, did you have to cram them
all into one weekend?

19:03.076 --> 19:05.543
Okay. What's the,
what's the problem here?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.378
You must have assumed
that one day

19:07.380 --> 19:09.180
I would have a serious
relationship.

19:09.182 --> 19:12.817
Okay, okay, look...I know
this is gonna sound corny

19:12.819 --> 19:15.486
but I had this kind of plan

19:15.488 --> 19:21.225
that-that you and I would have
this incredibly profound talk

19:21.227 --> 19:23.227
about all the things
that were gonna happen

19:23.229 --> 19:27.265
when you were about to

19:27.267 --> 19:29.967
go skiing.

19:29.969 --> 19:33.104
Mom, we're both adults.
Can we drop the euphemism?

19:33.106 --> 19:35.106
I'd rather not, thank you.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.810
Anyway, I-I thought
when you grew up

19:39.812 --> 19:45.016
we'd talk about our hopes
and our dreams

19:45.018 --> 19:46.984
how it would be.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.420
Kind of like
Terms of Endearment

19:49.422 --> 19:51.789
without me screaming
for your medication.

19:51.791 --> 19:55.459
[laughs]
As nice as that sounds.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.328
Oh, you are still my little girl

19:57.330 --> 20:02.800
and, and it kind of meant
the end of something.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.870
It meant the end
of something special.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.839
I mean, there were
so many things I..

20:08.841 --> 20:11.776
Did I say it all?
Did I give you enough?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.947
Oh, Lynnie.

20:15.949 --> 20:19.517
Lynnie, where did the time go?

20:19.519 --> 20:23.854
[sobbing]
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

20:23.856 --> 20:28.426
[sniffles]
It's okay. It's okay.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.127
It's just a mother's guilt trip.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.996
Well, you're surprisingly
good at it.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.965
[laughs]
Listen, if I start saying,

20:33.967 --> 20:36.300
"My feet are killing me,
it's your fault"

20:36.302 --> 20:37.969
you pull me back, okay?

20:37.971 --> 20:40.204
- I'll be there for you.
- Thanks.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.208
So..

20:44.210 --> 20:49.313
...you've, um, decided to
move in with Robert?

20:49.315 --> 20:53.718
No. I think I'll stick around
here for a while.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.090
Is it that Robert's a mime?

20:59.092 --> 21:02.126
Because there's places
he can go to get help.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.661
No! Hey!

21:06.199 --> 21:08.266
[instrumental music]

21:15.575 --> 21:16.974
Hi.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.312
You weren't thinking
I should leave, were you?

21:21.314 --> 21:24.615
Of course you should leave.
This is my room.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.351
But you'll be moving out
one of these days.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.088
Not today. Get out.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.757
I don't want to.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.258
I don't care.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.928
- An impasse, it would seem.
- ALF.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.664
You're not looking at
all the advantages

21:39.666 --> 21:41.799
of switching rooms, Lynn.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.468
This room is less drafty
than mine.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.504
And the bed is softer.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.940
And there's a nice view
out the window.

21:49.942 --> 21:53.177
ALF, those advantages are
all yours.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.547
What's your point?

21:56.549 --> 22:00.785
The point is I'm tired
and I want you out of here.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.087
I'll tell you what,
we'll share.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.989
Which side of the bed
do you want?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.058
- ALF.
- Better take the left.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.860
I have to warn you
I drool in my sleep.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.830
Now, if it comes out black,
run for your life.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.598
Don't ask questions.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.866
Come on.
