the evolving relationships.

00:14.136 --> 00:15.803

if "an unkindness of ravens"

is serialized.

"the creek"?

00:21.310 --> 00:26.147

but it'll have its own voice,

Hi.
Hi.

09:45.580 --> 09:48.248
Working on your blog?
I was.

09:48.249 --> 09:50.701
Now I'm checking out
my beautiful girlfriend.

09:50.702 --> 09:52.002
Aw.

09:52.003 --> 09:53.871
Marvin...

09:53.872 --> 09:55.989
Have you been happy
on the show lately?

09:55.990 --> 09:58.926
Of course.
I get to work with my girl.

09:58.927 --> 10:00.827
Very good answer.

10:00.828 --> 10:03.997
But, honestly, your blog,
the rivercourt,

10:03.998 --> 10:06.850
all these memories coming up
about Jimmy...

10:06.851 --> 10:09.636
don't you think it means
you miss sports?

10:11.189 --> 10:13.640
I do miss it.
And I miss Jimmy.

10:13.641 --> 10:16.944
But I would never drop the ball
on our show.

10:16.945 --> 10:18.062
Sports analogy.

10:19.114 --> 10:20.814
Even if I wanted to,
how would I do it

10:20.815 --> 10:23.400

a replacement anchor for you.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.854

10:27.855 --> 10:31.208
I already talked to Jerry
about you hosting a sports show.

10:31.209 --> 10:33.693
You talked to Jerry
about firing me?

10:33.694 --> 10:35.295
Don't be a dork!

10:42.170 --> 10:45.055
as much as I'll miss
spending my days with you,

10:45.056 --> 10:47.541
I'll love spending
my nights with you.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.895
If you want to know the answer,
it rhymes with "thick."

19:50.867 --> 19:52.684
It's dick, Ted.

19:54.304 --> 19:55.570
You're a dick.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.522
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

Brooke,
I am very sorry

22:37.757 --> 22:40.025
how I handled things
with Baker man.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.109
You should be.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.310
But you don't know
all the facts yet.

22:42.311 --> 22:43.745
Oh,
I do know the facts.

22:43.746 --> 22:45.146
If you remember,

22:45.147 --> 22:47.582
you had the housekeeper explain
them to me when I was 11.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.669
Well, Esmeralda always had
a very gentle way about her.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.839
Brooke, you might not like
what we did,

22:53.840 --> 22:55.340
but we're your parents,

22:55.341 --> 22:57.976
and I think you should give us
a chance to explain.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.328
Your father came to me

23:00.329 --> 23:02.848
right when you kicked him
out of the house.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.434
And for once, he was
genuinely remorseful.

23:05.435 --> 23:06.802
In fact, I could almost see
a glimpse of

23:06.803 --> 23:09.638
the selfless and caring man
I once knew.

23:10.673 --> 23:13.692

23:13.693 --> 23:16.194
Anyway, after we...
oh, my God.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.313
It's worse than hate sex.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.348
It was pity sex.

23:20.349 --> 23:21.700
After we talked,

23:21.701 --> 23:25.237
we both decided that Ted
should not sell the company.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.205
What?
Baker man.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.957
It's a good idea,
and it's yours.

23:28.958 --> 23:30.625

the investors.

watching the burning boat.

24:55.073 --> 24:57.057

Yeah.

24:57.058 --> 25:00.494

so different then.

25:00.495 --> 25:02.212

night about tutoring Nathan.

25:12.290 --> 25:13.340

25:17.679 --> 25:19.346
He is so good.

25:19.347 --> 25:20.798

with Jamie.

25:20.799 --> 25:23.016
You're amazing.
He was gone so long.

25:23.017 --> 25:25.936
I don't think I could let him
out of my sight.

25:25.937 --> 25:28.939
I know, but he wasn't
just gone from me.

25:28.940 --> 25:30.607
He was gone from Jamie.

25:30.608 --> 25:36.113
Especially after Dan's funeral,
I just think he...

25:36.114 --> 25:38.198
I think Jamie needed him
more than I do right now.

25:38.199 --> 25:40.033
Yeah.

25:40.034 --> 25:41.819

parents.

another chance.

25:58.953 --> 26:00.120
You're...

26:00.121 --> 26:02.756
listen, my mom used to say
love means giving chances

26:02.757 --> 26:04.791
when there's no more chances
left to give.

26:04.792 --> 26:06.560
Hmm.

I haven't told you this,

the audience will?

27:45.243 --> 27:46.726

she always gets up

30:16.561 --> 30:18.729
Look,
once she stopped swearing,

30:18.730 --> 30:21.181
she seemed to hold
her own pretty well.

30:21.182 --> 30:24.051
Jerry, we all want her to work
for all of our sakes,

30:24.052 --> 30:28.155
but she almost passed out
on the air twice.

30:28.156 --> 30:33.243
And she took a phone call
from her mom on the air.

30:33.244 --> 30:35.162
Look, all we're saying is
maybe you should be looking for

30:35.163 --> 30:37.080
a replacement anchor
in case she doesn't work out.

30:37.081 --> 30:40.233

want to show me?

31:45.733 --> 31:47.184
Come here.

31:50.021 --> 31:51.521
I got the sets
all figured out.

31:51.522 --> 31:55.659

32:55.083 --> 32:57.452
Well,
"Millie in the morning."

32:57.453 --> 32:58.752
Just not in the morning.

32:58.753 --> 33:00.588

here with me today

33:00.589 --> 33:02.756

33:11.099 --> 33:12.266
It's mills and skills,

33:12.267 --> 33:13.701
and we here all night
and all morning,

33:13.702 --> 33:15.703
and we about to burn
this boat down

33:15.704 --> 33:17.822
like Detroit after
the championship.

33:17.823 --> 33:22.543
But first, let's check in with
our new traffic chick, Kylie.

33:22.544 --> 33:25.129
It's bloody trafficky,
Tree Hill.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.081

33:27.082 --> 33:29.800
I'm weak.

33:29.801 --> 33:32.003

33:32.004 --> 33:34.338
Huh. Hey, chase.

33:36.225 --> 33:38.176
You got some stuff
for the burning boat?

33:38.177 --> 33:39.927
Yeah, I was thinking
about burning some of the stuff

33:39.928 --> 33:41.012
my dad left.

33:41.013 --> 33:42.847
Just thinking about it?

33:42.848 --> 33:45.099
Well, part of me wants to
keep it, I guess.

33:45.100 --> 33:46.484
You think that's wrong?

33:46.485 --> 33:48.736
Not at all.
You can always hang on to them.

33:48.737 --> 33:50.354
There's next year's
burning boat, right?

33:50.355 --> 33:52.156
Cool. Good idea.

33:52.157 --> 33:54.025
I brought some action figures
and fireworks,

33:54.026 --> 33:56.077
just in case
I change my mind.

33:56.078 --> 33:58.279
