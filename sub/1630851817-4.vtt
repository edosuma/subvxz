A NETFLIX SERIES

00:24.250 --> 00:25.750
<i>Wait.</i>

00:26.458 --> 00:27.583
<i>Turn around.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:01.250
Wonderful.

01:26.208 --> 01:32.416
AN ASTROLOGICAL GUIDE FOR BROKEN HEARTS

01:32.666 --> 01:36.208
CANCER

01:36.291 --> 01:39.333
Yes, I know that sex is important.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.958
But everything else is perfect,
that should matter.

01:43.041 --> 01:45.166
It's not just about chemistry.

01:45.875 --> 01:49.166
It's also about
getting to know each other.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.708
For example, I remember

01:50.791 --> 01:54.208
that at the start
Giovanni wasn't giving you fireworks.

01:54.291 --> 01:55.458
You're wrong.

01:55.541 --> 01:57.500
On our first week together,

01:57.583 --> 02:00.375
we received complaints
from other apartments for the noise.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.791
Good times.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.041
Good old times, right?

02:07.541 --> 02:09.416
Here he is.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.958
It might be my shot at happiness.

02:16.041 --> 02:16.916
Happiness?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.875
Yes, Paola. I have a wonderful boyfriend.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.625
He's so attentive.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.916
And work is finally going well.

02:26.541 --> 02:27.500
What about Enrico?

02:27.583 --> 02:30.250
I tried calling him,

02:30.333 --> 02:32.666
he's not returning my calls or texts.

02:34.833 --> 02:38.250
Why should I always feel guilty
when my life is going well?

02:40.750 --> 02:42.625
Don't I deserve a little bit of peace?

02:42.708 --> 02:44.250
What do you think, young man?

02:44.333 --> 02:45.166
Yes.

02:55.291 --> 02:56.916
<i>It's this Saturday, Mom.</i>

02:57.541 --> 02:59.000
Alright, this Saturday.

02:59.541 --> 03:01.666
You don't sound too happy.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.375
You didn't even ask about my show.

03:04.458 --> 03:05.583
What show?

03:07.458 --> 03:08.916
<i>Stars of Love.</i>

03:09.000 --> 03:11.916
<i>Our new show about astrology.</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:14.375
Ah, that show.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.291
<i>Alright, okay.</i>

03:15.375 --> 03:18.208
<i>I'll see you Saturday.</i>
<i>I'll get my stuff as well.</i>

03:18.291 --> 03:21.500
No, wait. I wanna do the enchufla too.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.083
<i>Mom, one last thing.</i>

03:23.166 --> 03:26.666
I'm coming with a friend,
he'll help me with the boxes.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.166
<i>You'll like him.</i>

03:28.250 --> 03:30.291
He's a great tango dancer.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.916
Listen, I can't really talk now.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.458
-Bye.
<i>-Bye</i>.

03:41.666 --> 03:42.916
Good morning, Carlo.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.208
-Olmo.
-Good morning.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.625
Good morning.

03:57.666 --> 03:58.583
Good morning.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.416
Where are you going?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.291
To my desk.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.458
I'll come with you.

04:13.416 --> 04:14.750
<i>My desk is there.</i>

04:14.833 --> 04:15.708
Please.

04:19.541 --> 04:23.708
The creator and producer
of Dora TV's brand new show

04:24.541 --> 04:26.208
needs her own space.

04:28.666 --> 04:29.500
What?

04:30.500 --> 04:31.958
Channel 8 liked it.

04:32.041 --> 04:32.875
Very much.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.333
A network exec will be on set
when we film the next episode.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.208
What do you think?

04:43.166 --> 04:44.166
See you later.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.250
I know you're mad at me, Enrico.

04:54.541 --> 04:58.500
But I had nothing to do
with Sardi's decision.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.125
Please believe me.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.500
He was a coward to fire you like that.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.541
At such a difficult time for you.

05:10.458 --> 05:11.416
And…

05:13.625 --> 05:14.708
I really miss you.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.708
Please call me back.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.666
Give Marlin a smile, every now and then.

05:34.750 --> 05:38.541
-Involve her in the conversation.
-She knows nothing about astrology.

05:38.625 --> 05:42.500
But she's a good friend of Bodrato's
and she's great at her job.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.708
Make an effort.

05:43.791 --> 05:44.791
Okay.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.083
So, how is it going?

05:51.166 --> 05:52.166
Well.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.416
Well, I think.

05:54.041 --> 05:56.500
He's not your typical Gemini.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.500
He's very precise.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.083
Attentive.

06:04.375 --> 06:05.458
And?

06:05.541 --> 06:06.375
And what?

06:07.166 --> 06:08.000
In bed?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.041
Well, he's so romantic and…

06:17.916 --> 06:18.958
I see.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.208
How sweet.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.666
Tiziano Falcetti?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.375
Tiziano Falcetti is me.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.833
It's your lucky day.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.416
Thank you.

06:28.958 --> 06:29.791
They're beautiful.

06:30.916 --> 06:31.958
She's not bad either.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.291
Who sent them?

06:33.375 --> 06:34.208
I don't know.

06:34.916 --> 06:35.875
Let's find out.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Okay.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.750
Someone I met at acting school.

06:43.291 --> 06:44.166
Someone?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.333
Does this someone have a name?

06:46.416 --> 06:47.541
Yes, "F."

06:48.875 --> 06:50.583
Either Francesca or Filippo.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.125
You're incredible, you know that?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.291
I know.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.875
I don't believe that
there is only one person for each of us.

07:01.458 --> 07:05.458
I've definitely never bought that whole
"and they lived happily ever after"

07:05.541 --> 07:07.000
that you see in movies.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.291
Those films make you dream.

07:10.666 --> 07:12.083
What's wrong with that?

07:12.166 --> 07:14.833
Nothing. But what's the point of dreaming

07:14.916 --> 07:17.208
when every day you could meet

07:17.291 --> 07:19.916
a new, interesting someone

07:20.000 --> 07:21.625
who is actually real?

07:21.708 --> 07:22.625
But…

07:23.375 --> 07:26.083
wouldn't you like to grow old
next to someone special?

07:27.083 --> 07:30.000
Someone who wants to share
their life with you?

07:30.500 --> 07:31.375
Bullshit.

07:36.875 --> 07:39.625
My gran was married for 54 years

07:39.708 --> 07:41.041
to the same man.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.708
The only man she ever had.

07:43.625 --> 07:44.625
Then one day,

07:45.125 --> 07:45.958
poof.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.625
He dumped her for a nurse half her age.

07:50.458 --> 07:54.750
My gran was 75.
And she was left alone and heartbroken.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.166
A great way of growing old together.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.708
To be honest, I can do without that.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.166
<i>Hey, Chiquitita.</i>

08:04.250 --> 08:06.125
<i>Please forgive me,</i>

08:06.208 --> 08:08.333
<i>but I can't come meet your parents.</i>

08:08.416 --> 08:10.541
<i>I promise I'll make it up to you.</i>

08:11.416 --> 08:12.333
Fuck.

08:16.083 --> 08:16.916
Hey.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.166
I'm free on Saturday, so…

08:21.041 --> 08:21.875
If you want.

08:52.208 --> 08:53.250
Ada?

08:54.500 --> 08:55.458
Ada?

08:55.958 --> 08:56.875
Ada!

08:56.958 --> 08:57.833
Come!

08:57.916 --> 08:59.208
You're daughter is here.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.083
What did you bring?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.041
Macarons.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.083
My specialty.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.833
-Come, love.
-Alice.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.791
Darling, what a lovely surprise.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.041
Why are you here?

09:12.750 --> 09:13.708
It's Saturday.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.125
I told you I was coming.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.041
Of course, Saturday.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.375
I thought you'd come earlier.

09:20.958 --> 09:23.125
But you're right in time

09:23.208 --> 09:25.166
for the salsa, so…

09:25.791 --> 09:27.125
Mrs. Bassi.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.166
A present for you.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.375
Thank you, how kind.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.500
Macarons.

09:33.541 --> 09:34.541
Call me Ada.

09:34.625 --> 09:35.625
Will do.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.291
He's a friend.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.875
Tiziano Falcetti.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.833
-Tio to my friends.
-Guido.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.416
I think I know you.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.958
Aren't you Marcus Alvarez de la Rosa

09:46.041 --> 09:47.125
in<i> Love Sickness?</i>

09:47.625 --> 09:48.583
Of course.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.166
I can't believe it!

09:51.250 --> 09:54.250
I didn't know
you were hanging out with VIPs!

09:54.333 --> 09:56.666
Delia is a huge fan of yours.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.208
Come, I'll introduce you.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.916
Delia, look who's here!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.333
<i>Well, have fun.</i>

10:01.416 --> 10:02.500
Delia!

<i>Thanks for your help, Tio.</i>

10:52.041 --> 10:53.541
Come, darling.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.208
You were wrong.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.541
Your friend can't do the tango.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.708
He's not the friend I meant to bring.

10:59.791 --> 11:02.291
Leave the boxes here,
come dancing with us.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.125
You told me to take them!

11:04.208 --> 11:06.250
It's just old junk.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.666
You can throw it away.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.041
<i>Oh no. Now she starts about Carlo.</i>

11:11.125 --> 11:12.333
Be like Carlo.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Move on.

11:14.083 --> 11:17.208
I was wondering when
you were going to bring him up.

11:17.291 --> 11:18.583
Let's go dance.

11:19.875 --> 11:20.791
Anyhow,

11:21.291 --> 11:23.666
Tio is very nice.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.500
And he's gorgeous.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.458
Truth be told, I didn't think

11:27.541 --> 11:30.416
you could find someone nicer than Carlo.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.791
He's not Carlo, though.

11:32.875 --> 11:33.791
Ada.

11:34.541 --> 11:36.416
This is the party of the century.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.958
For the record,

11:39.041 --> 11:40.333
I am moving on too.

11:40.416 --> 11:44.208
And if you'd bothered to ask me
about the new show I created,

11:44.833 --> 11:45.750
you would know.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.666
Cheers.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.291

NO NEW MESSAGES

12:11.750 --> 12:12.875
Hi, Alejandro.

12:12.958 --> 12:14.833
I wish you were here.

12:14.916 --> 12:19.958
I hope work isn't driving you crazy
and I was thinking about you.

12:20.041 --> 12:20.875
Bye.

12:22.666 --> 12:24.000
Ali.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.833
Come on. Let's go eat!

12:25.916 --> 12:27.708
-Let's go. Come on.
-No.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.125
Come on!

12:29.208 --> 12:30.375
Come!

12:32.291 --> 12:34.083
Alright, Alejandro didn't come.

12:34.166 --> 12:35.625
But I'm here for you.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.791
I needed you to lift boxes.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.791
I know you Libras always
want everything to be perfect.

12:42.875 --> 12:43.833
But

12:43.916 --> 12:45.208
look around you.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.458
All you need is right here.

12:49.041 --> 12:49.875
It's simple.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.458
Just relax.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.166
It might be simple for you.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.666
What do you mean?

12:55.750 --> 12:56.666
What do I mean?

12:56.750 --> 12:59.166
I mean that for you everything is easier.

12:59.875 --> 13:03.250
You move from person to person,
man or female, it doesn't matter

13:03.333 --> 13:05.958
as if it were absolutely normal.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.416
What do you do if someone gets hurt?

13:08.500 --> 13:09.666
Who cares, right?

13:09.750 --> 13:11.250
On to the next one.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.208
But I'm not like that, okay?

13:15.000 --> 13:15.833
For me…

13:17.083 --> 13:18.250
For me it's important--

13:18.333 --> 13:19.583
Okay, wait.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.458
I want to hear this.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.625
What's important for you, Alice?

13:26.125 --> 13:27.583
How romantic a man is?

13:27.666 --> 13:30.583
How much time he spends texting you?

13:30.666 --> 13:32.291
Whether he dances the tango?

13:32.375 --> 13:33.583
Or maybe how much…

13:36.166 --> 13:37.500
Sorry, I don't get it.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.500
You can say what you like about Alejandro,

13:40.583 --> 13:41.958
but nobody buys it.

13:42.041 --> 13:44.583
You see, gorgeous, life is too short

13:44.666 --> 13:47.583
to waste it on someone
who cannot make you orgasm.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.291
There is more to life than sex!

13:57.541 --> 13:58.791
There's feelings.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.333
-Taking care of one another.
-Blah blah.

14:01.416 --> 14:02.708
Listen to me.

14:02.791 --> 14:06.375
Even a Libra like you can be selfish,
every now and then.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.833
Okay. Impressive.

14:08.625 --> 14:11.291
I get lectured by someone
who refuses to fall in love

14:11.375 --> 14:15.000
and hides behind gender fluidity
and his gran's love troubles,

14:15.083 --> 14:18.333
so that he can keep behaving
like a selfish narcissist.

14:38.666 --> 14:39.500
Ada.

14:41.625 --> 14:42.583
Thank you

14:43.083 --> 14:44.583
for the beautiful day.

15:02.416 --> 15:04.416
I'M SORRY, TIO…

15:04.500 --> 15:07.625
I'M A BITCH.

15:07.708 --> 15:12.708
I TOOK IT OUT ON YOU
WHEN ACTUALLY I AM JUST FRUSTRATED.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.541
Good morning, <i>Chiquitita.</i>

15:50.625 --> 15:52.208
Forgive me for yesterday.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.541
<i>But I'm here now.</i>

15:55.833 --> 15:59.708
I'll make it up to you
by preparing my famous fried eggs.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.208
With guacamole.

16:05.000 --> 16:05.833
May I?

16:15.833 --> 16:17.916
<i>A pinch of salt.</i>

16:23.333 --> 16:25.041
And a little bit of pepper.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.666
<i>Very good, Chiquitita.</i>

16:27.750 --> 16:29.291
<i>-You like </i>pepper<i>?</i>
<i>-Very much.</i>

16:32.500 --> 16:33.916
A little lemon.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.166
Wait.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.083
Stay a little longer.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.041
<i>Why?</i>

17:02.541 --> 17:04.916
I like doing things a little slower.

17:05.750 --> 17:09.375
I'd like you to take your time
to get to know my body.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.416
With no rush.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.375
I'm not rushing.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.041
I'm just very passionate.

17:17.375 --> 17:18.375
I know.

17:19.458 --> 17:20.291
But,

17:20.375 --> 17:23.083
sometimes, passion can be…

17:25.166 --> 17:26.166
harnessed.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.250
Are you saying you don't like how I do it?

17:36.833 --> 17:39.500
No, I'm saying we're all different.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.875
<i>The eggs! Sorry.</i>

17:49.125 --> 17:50.708
Alright, Scorpio is okay.

17:50.791 --> 17:53.333
Mara, can you go behind Sagittarius?

17:53.416 --> 17:56.416
Sergio, be careful
when you do this movement.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.666
Because they all matter,
even those at the back.

17:59.750 --> 18:00.666
Alright?

18:00.750 --> 18:03.208
-And the same on the other side.
-The same.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.250
Tio…

18:05.375 --> 18:06.708
-Tio?
-Ms. Bassi?

18:08.208 --> 18:09.208
Alice.

18:09.791 --> 18:12.083
The network exec.

18:12.166 --> 18:16.208
Let me introduce you
to the show's creator, Alice Bassi.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.583
Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Bassi.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.041
The pleasure is all mine.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.083
I hope you enjoy today's episode.

18:23.166 --> 18:26.958
Should you need anything at all,
do not hesitate to ask.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.750
The only thing we need is

18:28.833 --> 18:31.791
that the show is as entertaining
as we hope. Right?

18:32.916 --> 18:33.875
-Alice?
-What?

18:33.958 --> 18:34.958
Where do we put these?

18:35.041 --> 18:38.083
Let's put them at the top, like last time.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.458
Hey.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.291
Did you see the network exec?

18:55.833 --> 18:56.916
What do you think?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.625
They didn't introduce us.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.000
Olmo, make sure the sound is clear.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.958
Tio's stupid jacket
always crackles on the mic.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.208
What's your problem?

19:12.250 --> 19:14.583
Can't you ever be happy for me?

19:25.416 --> 19:28.000
NO SIGNAL

19:29.000 --> 19:30.916
Alice, what is this?

19:31.958 --> 19:34.500
-Today's schedule.
-The schedule.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.291
You see, it says here

19:36.375 --> 19:40.250
that Tio does the intro
and interviews the contestant.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.333
Well, yes…

19:41.416 --> 19:46.333
I've been waking up Turin for 25 years.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.750
It's me the audience wants to see
when they turn on the TV.

19:49.833 --> 19:53.541
I won't be treated
like just another set prop.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.333
I am a professional.

19:58.416 --> 19:59.583
Of course, Marlin.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.666
Let's sort this out.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.083
Excuse me, Tio. Marlin was asking…

20:04.666 --> 20:05.958
I'm talking to you.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.583
Yes?

20:14.208 --> 20:17.833
Would you mind sharing
presenting duties with Marlin?

20:18.458 --> 20:20.458
Whatever you decide is fine with me.

20:27.541 --> 20:28.750
Do you know what?

20:29.541 --> 20:30.416
You're right.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.583
You do the introduction today.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:44.333 --> 20:48.250
Forgive me,
can you tell me where Dora TV is?

20:48.333 --> 20:50.208
I'm Andrea Magni.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.500
I'm taking part in <i>Stars of Love.</i>

20:52.583 --> 20:53.625
Nice to meet you.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.041
I'm Alice Bassi.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.333
I'm the assistant…

20:58.333 --> 20:59.583
I'm the show creator.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.125
-Follow me.
-Of course.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.208
It's just that…

21:04.708 --> 21:07.083
I am a little nervous.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.666
This is not my kind of thing.

21:12.083 --> 21:12.958
I'm an academic.

21:13.875 --> 21:14.958
Yes.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.125
My mom pushed me to take part.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.541
Anyway.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.583
I have a few questions about…

21:24.666 --> 21:26.666
How do you call it?

21:27.166 --> 21:28.166
The astral chart.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.083
May I?

21:29.166 --> 21:30.166
Of course.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.208
Tio, our astrological expert,

21:32.291 --> 21:33.583
will enlighten you.

21:33.666 --> 21:35.000
Please, sit down here.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.541
-Andrea, we'll start shortly.
-Okay.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.875
-Be ready.
-You too.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.291
Is everything okay?

21:43.375 --> 21:45.625
-Yes, thanks.
-An early evening slot…

21:45.708 --> 21:47.166
Places everyone.

21:48.958 --> 21:49.791
Camera one.

21:51.750 --> 21:52.666
Open on them.

21:53.666 --> 21:54.541
Alice.

21:57.375 --> 22:01.291
<i>Welcome to a new episode of </i>Stars of Love,

22:01.375 --> 22:03.708
<i>dear Dora TV friends.</i>

22:03.791 --> 22:08.125
Before we begin, let me introduce
today's astrological hero.

22:08.666 --> 22:10.208
Andrea Magni!

22:13.583 --> 22:14.958
Great. Please, come in.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.416
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.458
-Am I good here?
-Yes, right here.

22:18.541 --> 22:20.416
Andrea is a geologist.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.583
-Is that right?
-Yes.

22:21.666 --> 22:22.750
And he's been single…

22:22.833 --> 22:23.916
For real?

22:25.166 --> 22:27.875
A lover of rocks

22:27.958 --> 22:30.166
and tectonic plates.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.125
You don't say.

22:31.708 --> 22:32.750
And volcanoes.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.541
Great. Let's find out

22:35.625 --> 22:39.250
if our beautiful Zodiac ladies

22:39.333 --> 22:42.500
will ignite his passion for the stars.

22:48.833 --> 22:49.666
<i>And…</i>

22:51.125 --> 22:52.166
What's up with Tio?

22:52.250 --> 22:53.958
<i>And now, our Tio…</i>

22:54.041 --> 22:54.875
Nothing.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.625
It'll be fine.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.125
…will present Andrea's astral chart.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.500
No, you read it.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.208
And…

23:04.875 --> 23:06.625
Tio, can you cut in, please?

23:06.708 --> 23:07.541
Well…

23:07.625 --> 23:08.458
<i>Well…</i>

23:09.416 --> 23:11.791
<i>Andrea Magni's sign is</i>

23:11.875 --> 23:14.125
Cancer, isn't it?

23:14.208 --> 23:15.333
Exactly right.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.333
Let's get one thing straight.

23:18.958 --> 23:21.416
You will be never be better

23:22.208 --> 23:24.250
than a Cancer's beloved Mom.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.916
Their relationship is

23:27.000 --> 23:29.791
so intimate and harmonious,

23:29.875 --> 23:33.458
that a Cancer sees no need
to fly the nest.

23:33.541 --> 23:35.500
But don't worry.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.750
The good news is

23:37.833 --> 23:41.166
you'll soon meet your competition,

23:42.000 --> 23:43.041
naturally,

23:43.125 --> 23:47.916
as soon as the lovable,
sensitive, and caring Cancer

23:48.000 --> 23:49.333
invites you to his place

23:49.833 --> 23:51.541
to proudly show you

23:52.291 --> 23:53.916
his childhood room.

23:54.875 --> 23:56.375
Are you the astrology expert?

23:57.125 --> 23:58.125
So they say.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.583
May I ask a couple of questions
about my astral chart?

24:02.666 --> 24:04.166
Please, that's why I'm here.

24:04.250 --> 24:08.208
I don't think there is
any scientific evidence

24:08.291 --> 24:12.500
supporting a link between the stars
and people's personalities.

24:12.583 --> 24:13.875
<i>Scientific evidence?</i>

24:13.958 --> 24:15.791
<i>And there is no valid reason</i>

24:15.875 --> 24:19.166
<i>to divide the whole human race</i>
<i>into 12 groups</i>,

24:19.250 --> 24:22.750
<i>each represented</i>
<i>by a totally random symbol.</i>

24:23.750 --> 24:24.958
Should I stop them?

24:25.041 --> 24:27.333
<i>-The magnetic field…</i>
-Okay.

24:27.416 --> 24:29.916
<i>…generated by planets is much smaller</i>

24:30.000 --> 24:31.833
<i>-than our appliances.</i>
-Excuse me.

24:32.583 --> 24:35.458
We might as well use
the symbol of a toaster

24:35.541 --> 24:37.208
or of a radio than a Zodiac.

24:38.791 --> 24:40.583
I think we should stop.

24:40.666 --> 24:42.250
No, wait for Alice.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.333
I was wondering

24:44.416 --> 24:46.291
how can the Zodiac help me

24:46.375 --> 24:48.375
find the right person?

24:48.458 --> 24:49.583
I mean, after all,

24:49.666 --> 24:51.125
love is the only subject

24:51.208 --> 24:53.166
that is not bound by scientific rules.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.000
That's the beauty of it.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.541
Well…

24:59.625 --> 25:00.750
Okay, Marlin.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.250
I'll tell you what to say,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.291
Love is indeed a mystery.

25:05.375 --> 25:09.416
Well, love… Love is indeed a mystery.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.041
Going back to your question--

25:11.125 --> 25:15.375
Going back
to your very interesting question,

25:15.458 --> 25:16.750
-Andrea.
-Andrea.

25:16.833 --> 25:19.250
In astrology, the moon rules--

25:19.333 --> 25:22.041
In astrology, the moon rules

25:22.125 --> 25:25.833
our emotions and our feelings.

25:25.916 --> 25:28.708
And in astrology, the moon is associated

25:28.791 --> 25:30.416
with Cancer, a water sign.

25:30.500 --> 25:34.666
And is associated with Cancer,
a water sign.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.125
<i>-Which reminds us…</i>
-Stay on Marlin.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.208
…that sure,

25:38.291 --> 25:43.333
we can feel safe and secure
underneath our tough shell,

25:44.041 --> 25:47.375
but if we only let ourselves
be governed by life's natural flow

25:47.458 --> 25:50.833
we may realize that,
after all, we do not need

25:50.916 --> 25:52.458
our shell at all.

25:52.541 --> 25:54.916
-And in essence…
-And in essence…

25:55.000 --> 25:56.666
<i>…this is what astrology does.</i>

25:56.750 --> 25:57.791
<i>It helps us</i> <i>understand</i>

25:57.875 --> 25:59.500
<i>-who we are…</i>
-Camera two.

25:59.583 --> 26:04.291
<i>…</i>get to know ourselves,
and understand those around us.

26:04.375 --> 26:08.625
And if this helps us find true love

26:09.416 --> 26:10.791
what's wrong with that?

26:10.875 --> 26:12.000
Right, Tio?

26:13.041 --> 26:14.000
Well said, Marlin.

26:14.083 --> 26:17.000
Well said.
You stole the words out of my mouth.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.875
<i>A round of applause, please.</i>

26:21.041 --> 26:23.416
Marlin, if I may say so,

26:23.500 --> 26:27.291
you look particularly gorgeous today.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.416
A true siren of the stars

26:30.000 --> 26:31.666
in the sea of our insecurities.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.625
…and 16 personalities.

26:40.708 --> 26:41.875
-Bye.
-Bye.

26:42.541 --> 26:44.000
No, I'll find you.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.458
My dear, Alice. Thank you.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.541
You were wonderful, thank you.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.875
-No, you are wonderful.
-No, you are.

26:52.958 --> 26:53.791
Alice?

26:53.875 --> 26:55.333
-Thanks, hon.
-Thank you.

26:55.416 --> 26:57.208
-Marlin?
-Who is that?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.458
Congratulations, Ms. Bassi.

27:17.541 --> 27:18.958
-Can I call you Alice?
-Sure.

27:19.041 --> 27:20.958
What a fun episode.

27:21.041 --> 27:23.000
Thank you. It's all about teamwork.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.083
True.

27:24.166 --> 27:25.750
Congratulations to Davide

27:25.833 --> 27:28.000
for believing in this idea.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.416
It was a truly great idea.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.250
Shall we have a drink to celebrate?

27:33.333 --> 27:34.541
I'd love to.

27:37.000 --> 27:37.958
Are you happy?

27:38.041 --> 27:38.916
Yes.

27:40.625 --> 27:41.458
Thank you.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.125
Enrico,

27:50.208 --> 27:52.166
you should have seen their faces.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.125
The network exec's eyes were sparkling.

27:56.291 --> 27:57.833
And Sardi's too.

27:58.333 --> 28:01.458
But he's the asshole who fired you, so…

28:04.625 --> 28:05.458
Tio.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.041
We're friends.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.083
But when we're at work

28:15.166 --> 28:18.208
and I ask you to do something,
I expect you to do it.

28:18.791 --> 28:20.583
With no arguments, okay?

28:21.583 --> 28:22.416
Okay.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.333
I didn't like the way
you spoke about my gran.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I overreacted.

28:33.458 --> 28:34.291
I'm sorry.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.250
I'm sorry too.

28:52.166 --> 28:54.000
I didn't mean to judge you.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.375
I know.

28:57.958 --> 28:58.791
Okay.

29:06.416 --> 29:07.250
However,

29:07.791 --> 29:08.625
that Andrea…

29:09.333 --> 29:11.250
He had a lot to say, didn't he?

29:11.333 --> 29:12.375
What a character.

29:13.791 --> 29:14.916
He's interesting.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.250
-See you tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.583
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.208
Are you tired?

29:38.291 --> 29:40.875
I saw, you kept running around.

29:41.375 --> 29:43.416
Babe, can you wait a moment?

29:43.500 --> 29:44.375
Yes.

29:44.875 --> 29:45.708
Thank you.

29:55.541 --> 29:57.250
I wanted to tell you…

29:58.458 --> 29:59.291
well done.

30:01.375 --> 30:02.416
The show works.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.041
It's funny.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.375
And you were right.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.083
I was a little bit jealous of you.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.708
I just always thought
we'd make it big together.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.875
But maybe the truth is…

30:26.625 --> 30:27.833
that I needed you.

30:29.916 --> 30:32.375
A lot more than you needed me.

30:36.750 --> 30:37.583
Bye.

30:47.666 --> 30:49.333
Yes, all good.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.916
Mara, hey.<i> </i>Have you seen Alejandro?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.666
Who hasn't seen Alejandro?

31:20.375 --> 31:23.166
You'd be a great tango dancer.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.958
-That's not true.
-I swear.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.000
No way.

31:29.916 --> 31:31.416
Did you fall for it too?

31:32.583 --> 31:34.333
He's like that with everyone.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.416
The beginning is great.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.375
It's so great that you feel calm.

31:38.458 --> 31:42.375
And you mention that, maybe,
he could work on a couple of things.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.833
And then, poof.

31:45.541 --> 31:47.291
He stands you up.

31:47.375 --> 31:48.791
He avoids you at work.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.500
Until he finds another girl

31:51.583 --> 31:53.291
to cook his fried eggs for.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.333
Woman to woman,
believe me, it's for the best.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.833
Life is too short to waste it
on a guy who doesn't now how to fuck.

32:15.833 --> 32:16.791
<i>Hi, Alice.</i>

32:16.875 --> 32:20.958
<i>I didn't send you the horoscope today</i>
<i>because I was angry, but here it is,</i>

32:21.041 --> 32:24.375
<i>"Today you feel inspired.</i>
<i>Such a great feeling</i>

32:24.458 --> 32:27.333
<i>but you might not know how to channel it.</i>"

32:27.416 --> 32:29.875
<i>"This may well be</i>
<i>a spiritual turning point,</i>

32:30.458 --> 32:34.416
<i>it might trigger an artistic rebirth,</i>
<i>or a greater understanding of others."</i>

32:34.500 --> 32:36.125
<i>"One thing is certain,</i>

32:36.208 --> 32:38.541
<i>you'll want to spend some time alone."</i>

32:38.625 --> 32:40.916
<i>"But never doubt yourself,</i>

32:41.583 --> 32:43.291
<i>no matter how flat you feel."</i>

32:46.708 --> 32:47.541
Fuck.

32:49.708 --> 32:50.541
No.

33:00.791 --> 33:01.625
Okay.

33:11.916 --> 33:12.916
Do you need help?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.125
No.

33:14.208 --> 33:15.375
Thank you.

33:15.958 --> 33:16.833
Not from you,

33:17.375 --> 33:19.958
not from anybody.

33:20.041 --> 33:23.083
I'm perfectly able

33:23.166 --> 33:25.291
to look after myself

33:25.833 --> 33:27.666
and to change a tire.

33:30.541 --> 33:31.625
Okay.

33:38.166 --> 33:39.916
You have…

33:49.416 --> 33:51.166
I don't know why you're angry at me.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.375
I wanted to congratulate you
for a job well done.

33:55.000 --> 33:55.958
Good night.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.125
Ms. Bassi.
