00:25.133 --> 00:26.933
I'm not your friend.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.100
Maybe I can be, but not at
4 o'clock in the morning.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.165
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

00:32.232 --> 00:33.699
It turns you on.

00:33.766 --> 00:34.832
Getting paid.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.133
Yes!

00:38.066 --> 00:39.232
Say it!

00:39.300 --> 00:42.066
It turns me on!

00:42.133 --> 00:44.666
- I miss you already.
- How did you get this number?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.933
Christine!

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
- Just want to talk.
- I'm sorry, I don't know you.

00:51.066 --> 00:52.932
Look, I just... I wanna talk.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.300
I just wanna talk. I wanna talk!

00:55.366 --> 00:57.232
I'm sure this is uncomfortable
for you because

00:57.300 --> 00:59.000
obviously you're very close to Jack.

00:59.066 --> 01:01.232
I just would like you to talk to him

01:01.366 --> 01:03.266
because he's threatening me.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.933
And disrupting my life.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.933
David's intentionally
throwing the XHP case.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.933
That's a very serious accusation.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.433
Play it.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.233
I will make sure it
is not going to trial.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.366
She knows about Quorta.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.966
Take it in all the way.

01:34.133 --> 01:36.266
You like getting
paid for sex, don't you?

01:36.333 --> 01:38.233
It turns you on, getting paid.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.033
Say it!

01:42.100 --> 01:43.200
It turns me on!

This is Christine Reade.

01:50.566 --> 01:53.866
What did you tell Ana, you fucking cunt?

02:08.814 --> 02:10.098
Hey, I'm gonna go this way.

02:27.266 --> 02:28.199
Holy shit!

02:28.266 --> 02:29.499
What?

02:37.433 --> 02:39.999
Skip Hadderly's office.
This is Christine Reade.

02:40.066 --> 02:42.366
I need to see you in
my office right now.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.200
- Why?
- You know why.

02:57.566 --> 03:00.132
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

03:00.398 --> 03:02.498
It turns you on, getting paid.

03:16.632 --> 03:18.198
Here she comes.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.465
Turn it off.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.498
Turn it off.

03:26.698 --> 03:28.231
David wants to see me.

03:42.332 --> 03:43.465
You wanted to see me?

03:43.532 --> 03:44.589
Shut the door.

03:44.761 --> 03:46.565
I'd rather leave it open.

03:46.632 --> 03:48.565
Shut the fucking door!

03:53.498 --> 03:55.764
I don't... I don't know what to think.

03:55.832 --> 03:58.565
I have no idea why you
would do something like this.

03:58.632 --> 04:00.765
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

04:00.898 --> 04:02.418
You don't know what I'm talking about?

04:04.198 --> 04:06.564
You do this kind of stuff all the time?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.265
Take it in all the way.

04:13.198 --> 04:14.364
I don't know what that is.

04:14.432 --> 04:15.865
You don't know what that is?

04:16.332 --> 04:18.398
No?

04:18.464 --> 04:21.130
- Take a look at it.
- You like getting paid...

04:22.665 --> 04:24.131
Say it!

04:24.198 --> 04:25.498
It turns me on!

04:33.498 --> 04:35.398
It's all over for you.

04:35.465 --> 04:37.331
You realize that, right?

04:37.398 --> 04:38.431
It's all over.

04:40.598 --> 04:42.598
Who sent you that?

04:42.665 --> 04:44.265
Who sent it?

04:45.465 --> 04:46.865
You sent it.

04:47.565 --> 04:48.598
I didn't send that.

04:48.665 --> 04:50.598
No? Look!

04:51.565 --> 04:53.531
That's your fucking email!

04:55.332 --> 04:57.565
It didn't just go to me, too.

04:57.632 --> 04:59.332
It went to everybody.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.464
Everybody!

05:03.465 --> 05:05.398
Is this about me?

05:05.465 --> 05:07.898
Did you send this to my wife?

05:07.965 --> 05:10.465
I have no idea what you are doing.

05:10.532 --> 05:13.398
What's your angle? Why
are you doing this?

05:13.465 --> 05:15.198
Talking to Erin?

05:15.265 --> 05:16.825
Like sticking your nose in things

05:16.850 --> 05:18.455
that have nothing to do with you.

05:18.498 --> 05:21.398
- Maybe my email got hacked.
- I don't care!

05:21.465 --> 05:24.698
I want you to delete all
of our communications.

05:24.765 --> 05:26.198
Every email.

05:26.265 --> 05:27.398
Every text.

05:27.465 --> 05:28.598
That's not me.

05:28.665 --> 05:29.631
I don't care.

05:31.465 --> 05:35.598
I want you out of my fucking life.

05:35.665 --> 05:37.431
I want you out of this building.

05:37.498 --> 05:39.831
I want you to just disappear.

05:39.898 --> 05:41.331
Hey! Do you hear me?

05:41.398 --> 05:42.398
Delete everything!

05:42.465 --> 05:44.465
I do not want to be associated with you!

05:45.565 --> 05:48.298
What is this?

05:53.732 --> 05:55.365
Take it in all the way.

05:59.765 --> 06:01.365
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

06:02.531 --> 06:04.631
Is this supposed to be funny?

06:05.931 --> 06:08.531
She recorded this?

06:08.598 --> 06:10.198
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

06:10.231 --> 06:11.664
It's definitely her.

06:13.598 --> 06:14.798
She's lost her mind.

06:14.831 --> 06:16.431
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

06:44.031 --> 06:46.031
Take it in all the way.

06:53.754 --> 06:55.054
You like getting
paid for sex, don't you?

06:55.121 --> 06:56.387
Yes.

06:56.454 --> 06:58.554
It turns you on, getting paid.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.254
Say it!

07:02.321 --> 07:04.087
It turns me on!

07:34.354 --> 07:36.754
It turns you on, getting paid.

07:36.821 --> 07:38.587
I'm glad she's getting paid.

07:39.254 --> 07:40.254
Say it!

07:40.321 --> 07:42.254
It turns me on!

08:10.488 --> 08:12.688
I'm-I'm so sorry, Skip.

08:12.754 --> 08:16.020
What-what was it that you'd
wanted me to check on citations?

08:18.588 --> 08:20.321
Check the citations and...

08:21.254 --> 08:22.320
double-check the data.

08:22.388 --> 08:23.488
Okay.

08:54.821 --> 08:56.687
You know, if you wanna...

08:56.754 --> 08:58.354
If you wanna go home,

08:58.421 --> 09:00.380
and take the rest of
the day off, it's...

09:00.410 --> 09:01.710
It's fine.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.109
Why?

09:09.276 --> 09:11.260
I-I can understand if you feel

09:11.285 --> 09:13.333
uncomfortable here right now.

09:13.376 --> 09:14.609
Why is that?

09:22.110 --> 09:24.210
Well, the...

09:26.243 --> 09:29.876
Are you saying that you
want me to go home?

09:30.276 --> 09:31.242
Ummm...

09:31.643 --> 09:33.576
No, no.

09:33.643 --> 09:35.376
Stay if you like.

09:35.443 --> 09:37.176
Forget I mentioned it.

09:51.510 --> 09:53.543
Why would she send that?

09:56.276 --> 10:00.509
She probably
rents hotel rooms on penthouses.

10:02.892 --> 10:04.343
I think she's in business in New York.

10:04.410 --> 10:05.510
Yeah, I think so.

10:05.576 --> 10:08.309
I mean, she's so
fucking dirty, like I...

10:08.376 --> 10:10.442
He was fucking her in the
ass? There's no question.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.710
She's messed up, man.

10:11.776 --> 10:14.242
Who sends out a sex
tape in a law office?

10:14.310 --> 10:16.443
I'd still fuck her, man.

10:16.510 --> 10:18.743
That doesn't say
anything, man, you'd fuck anything.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.376
Yeah.

10:20.443 --> 10:21.709
Don't mind me.

10:22.510 --> 10:23.676
Keep talking.

10:27.643 --> 10:29.243
Excuse me.

10:29.310 --> 10:30.710
Oh, sorry, I'm in your way?

10:30.776 --> 10:32.676
No, no need to apologize.

10:34.143 --> 10:35.509
The coffee sucks.

10:37.643 --> 10:39.209
How's your day?

10:40.410 --> 10:42.576
How do you think?

10:42.643 --> 10:45.709
Well, I can only
imagine, especially for interns.

10:45.776 --> 10:48.209
What exactly can you imagine?

10:49.410 --> 10:51.576
Just have a lot to take in.

10:54.443 --> 10:56.776
I wanna make something very clear.

10:58.243 --> 11:01.243
You're making me feel very,
very uncomfortable.

11:01.376 --> 11:03.142
Yeah, uncomfortable how?

11:03.210 --> 11:05.110
Wh-what are you talking about?

11:05.176 --> 11:07.476
I think you know what I'm talking about.

11:10.710 --> 11:13.276
Interns are all spread too thin?

11:13.343 --> 11:15.343
Alright, you're
all... you're all overworked.

11:18.176 --> 11:21.442
I don't think that's what you meant.

11:21.510 --> 11:23.435
I dunno what you're talking about...

11:23.460 --> 11:24.101
Okay.

11:24.143 --> 11:26.743
Let's all just take it down a notch.

11:26.810 --> 11:29.643
I'm sorry for my friend here.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.310
Please get your hands off me.

11:40.143 --> 11:41.509
She's still here.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.676
That's so embarrassing.

11:51.589 --> 11:53.510
You can't go in
there, she's in a meeting.

11:53.576 --> 11:55.242
- I can see that.
- You need to come back later.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.443
Excuse me, so sorry.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.143
I need to talk to you
when you get a second.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.343
I'll come back later.

12:26.343 --> 12:28.509
You just have a lot to take in.

12:28.576 --> 12:30.442
I wanna make something very clear.

12:30.509 --> 12:33.309
You're making me feel very,
very uncomfortable.

12:33.376 --> 12:36.242
Yeah, uncomfortable how?

12:36.309 --> 12:39.275
Are you saying that you
want me to go home?

12:39.343 --> 12:41.443
No, no...

12:41.509 --> 12:43.075
Stay if you like.

12:43.143 --> 12:45.009
Forget I mentioned it.

12:45.076 --> 12:46.942
Is this about me?

12:47.009 --> 12:48.942
Did you send this to my wife?

12:49.009 --> 12:52.442
I want you to delete all
of our communications.

12:52.509 --> 12:53.909
Every email.

12:53.976 --> 12:55.076
Every text.

12:55.143 --> 12:56.176
That's not me.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.576
Hey! Do you hear me?

12:57.643 --> 12:58.943
Delete everything!

12:59.009 --> 13:01.475
I do not want to be associated with you!

13:04.709 --> 13:06.675
Fucking psychopath!

13:16.443 --> 13:18.009
Bullshit...

13:25.309 --> 13:27.175
I'm about to jump into
a meeting, what's up?

13:27.243 --> 13:29.176
Hey, I was just calling to say hi.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.576
Hi.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.143
Is everything okay?

13:33.643 --> 13:34.976
Yeah, I'm just busy.

13:35.043 --> 13:36.243
What is it?

13:36.309 --> 13:37.509
Ahhh, I just...

13:37.576 --> 13:39.376
Ummm...

13:39.443 --> 13:42.109
I just can't wait to see you tonight.

13:42.176 --> 13:43.976
I might be home late.

13:44.843 --> 13:46.376
You sure everything's okay?

13:46.443 --> 13:48.376
I already told you, yes.

13:48.443 --> 13:50.276
- I need to go.
- Okay.

13:52.643 --> 13:54.309
I'll see you later.

13:56.176 --> 13:57.609
Bye... I love you.

14:10.276 --> 14:12.576
What's her fucking name?

14:16.376 --> 14:18.609
Kayla, can you come
in here for a minute?

14:31.509 --> 14:32.509
Come on in, have a seat.

14:32.576 --> 14:34.576
Close the door please.

14:34.643 --> 14:36.276
Thanks.

14:45.309 --> 14:46.709
You and Christine are friends?

14:48.209 --> 14:50.075
Sort of.

14:50.143 --> 14:54.076
I'm concerned about her behavior lately.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.209
Have you noticed anything? Has
she said anything to you?

14:57.643 --> 14:59.709
No... No.

15:03.175 --> 15:04.642
Ummm...

15:04.988 --> 15:07.075
She-she didn't tell me about the video,

15:07.142 --> 15:09.742
if-if that's what you're asking.

15:09.809 --> 15:13.009
I mean why would she send
something like that out?

15:13.075 --> 15:14.708
Well, I...

15:16.309 --> 15:18.842
- I'm...
- We'll never know, of course.

15:18.909 --> 15:22.809
Um, when I rotated her, did
she say anything to you?

15:22.875 --> 15:24.808
Did she confide in you?

15:24.875 --> 15:25.975
No, ahhh...

15:26.042 --> 15:29.008
She didn't say
anything, but she did seem upset.

15:29.075 --> 15:30.708
She didn't say anything?

15:31.942 --> 15:33.175
It's okay.

15:34.242 --> 15:36.142
- You can tell me, it's all right.
- Oh.

15:37.909 --> 15:39.675
Okay... Ummm...

15:40.809 --> 15:43.642
She-she wanted access to your files.

15:44.042 --> 15:46.008
Why?

15:46.075 --> 15:49.875
She needed to verify some
information for Skip and

15:49.942 --> 15:53.642
she wanted to cross-reference
some of your prior cases.

15:55.175 --> 15:57.475
And you gave her access?

16:01.775 --> 16:02.775
Ahhh...

16:04.775 --> 16:06.208
- I...
- It's okay.

16:06.275 --> 16:09.008
I don't care, I just need to know.

16:09.075 --> 16:10.208
Yeah.

16:10.275 --> 16:12.275
I-I thought I was just helping her out.

16:13.942 --> 16:15.242
Ummm...

16:19.009 --> 16:20.042
Okay.

16:26.659 --> 16:28.042
- Jeff's not in there, right?
- No.

16:28.109 --> 16:30.575
Okay.

16:30.642 --> 16:32.908
I wanna make something very clear.

16:34.275 --> 16:37.341
You're making me feel very,
very uncomfortable.

16:39.709 --> 16:41.209
- Hey, buddy, got a minute?
- Yeah.

16:41.275 --> 16:42.275
Have you seen the video?

16:42.742 --> 16:44.075
Yes.

16:44.142 --> 16:45.808
Look, I uh,

16:45.875 --> 16:47.541
She's gotta get out of her, I tried...

16:47.609 --> 16:48.742
I-I did try.

16:48.809 --> 16:50.075
But she's...

16:50.142 --> 16:51.942
I think she's in shock, and
to be honest with you,

16:52.009 --> 16:53.142
I-I don't think she sent that email.

16:53.209 --> 16:54.875
Oh, no she sent it.

16:54.942 --> 16:57.175
She is totally unstable.

16:57.242 --> 16:58.774
You know and Kayla said that

16:58.799 --> 17:00.932
Christine wanted access to my files.

17:01.042 --> 17:03.142
She said that you told her to

17:03.209 --> 17:05.775
cross-reference for one of your cases?

17:06.309 --> 17:07.942
Ahhh...

17:09.579 --> 17:11.875
- No, I didn't ask her to do that.
- No, of course, you didn't!

17:11.942 --> 17:15.008
I just want to make sure that
you and I are on the same page.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.008
Okay? Cause she's been pulling
some shit lately.

17:17.075 --> 17:19.008
But don't worry. I'm
gonna take care of it.

17:19.075 --> 17:20.275
I got this.

17:20.342 --> 17:24.008
I want you to delete all
of our communications.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.141
Every email.

17:25.209 --> 17:26.775
Every text.

17:26.842 --> 17:27.942
That's not me.

17:28.009 --> 17:30.309
Hey! Do you hear me? Delete everything!

17:30.375 --> 17:32.841
I do not want to be associated with you!

17:41.709 --> 17:43.975
Why do you want me to
delete all our correspondence?

17:44.042 --> 17:45.975
Is it 'cause you're worried
I'm gonna tell someone about us?

17:46.042 --> 17:47.608
I'm not worried.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.975
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.

17:50.842 --> 17:51.942
Does Megan know?

17:53.475 --> 17:55.975
Did you tell your wife about us?

17:58.675 --> 18:00.657
I don't understand why
you won't talk to me.

18:00.658 --> 18:01.352
I don't know what I did wrong.

18:01.419 --> 18:03.685
I miss spending time with you.

18:03.752 --> 18:05.652
There is nothing between us.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.452
Who's Quorta?

18:10.486 --> 18:11.986
- What'd you just say?
- Quorta.

18:12.052 --> 18:14.618
The shell company you were talking
to Ben Holgrem about.

18:17.552 --> 18:19.818
Stay the fuck away from me!

18:19.886 --> 18:21.719
You are fucking insane!

18:27.441 --> 18:29.241
That's not something we agreed to.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.948
You can't go in
there, she's on the phone!

18:32.308 --> 18:33.241
- Hold on.
- I'm assuming you saw the video.

18:33.308 --> 18:34.974
I tried to stop her!

18:35.041 --> 18:36.974
It's okay.

18:37.041 --> 18:40.407
Listen, I'm gonna have to
call you back, I apologize.

18:41.741 --> 18:43.341
- You saw the video.
- I saw it.

18:43.408 --> 18:45.528
I didn't send that. I
don't know where that came from.

18:49.841 --> 18:51.907
I think it was David.

18:52.908 --> 18:55.041
It's gonna be okay.

18:55.108 --> 18:57.041
I think he's trying to
discredit everything that I have...

18:57.108 --> 18:59.041
Everything that... everything
that I know.

19:00.108 --> 19:01.474
I understand.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.307
You're upset, you're confused.

19:03.374 --> 19:04.974
No, no, no, no, no!

19:05.041 --> 19:07.974
He grabbed
me in the hallway!

19:08.041 --> 19:10.007
He's trying to scare me.

19:12.341 --> 19:14.307
This is a shocking day.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.341
But it's gonna be fine.

19:16.408 --> 19:19.841
Please stop saying everything's
gonna be okay.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.774
What do you want me to do?

19:21.841 --> 19:24.207
Evans wants to see Christine right away.

19:26.008 --> 19:28.441
They're gonna kick me out of here.

19:28.508 --> 19:30.308
What do you want me to do?

19:32.908 --> 19:35.308
I want you to tell me you believe me.

19:39.074 --> 19:40.040
I...

19:40.108 --> 19:41.941
I want you to tell me you believe me.

19:45.841 --> 19:47.041
Okay.

20:01.108 --> 20:03.141
This could get ugly, Tariq.

20:03.874 --> 20:04.874
This girl...

20:05.874 --> 20:08.240
Her behavior is alarming.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.041
And I don't think we can underestimate

20:11.108 --> 20:12.808
uh, just how unstable she is.

20:12.874 --> 20:15.207
We need to be very careful with this.

20:16.241 --> 20:17.907
Look...

20:17.974 --> 20:19.767
She's made a number of physical

20:19.792 --> 20:21.931
advances towards me in the office.

20:21.974 --> 20:24.240
I tried to let her down politely.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.808
- I rotated her to Skip.
- Did you fuck her?

20:27.874 --> 20:29.807
Gentlemen, I've got work to do.

20:29.874 --> 20:32.174
We're letting this girl go, right?

20:32.241 --> 20:35.241
- I'm tired of talking about it.
- Yeah.

20:35.308 --> 20:37.308
- Mr. Barr?
- Thanks for this.

20:37.374 --> 20:38.940
Have a seat.

20:40.241 --> 20:41.974
Uhhh, yeah, yeah.

20:53.341 --> 20:55.107
Absolutely. It's fine.

20:55.174 --> 20:56.307
Here she comes.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.106
Have a seat.

21:00.107 --> 21:01.273
I'd rather stand.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.944
Listen, emails sent from your personal

21:05.969 --> 21:07.497
account has been very disruptive.

21:07.540 --> 21:09.906
You have no idea what I'm going through.

21:09.974 --> 21:13.107
You're absolutely right, I don't.

21:13.174 --> 21:15.214
We need to send you home until
we can further assess

21:15.240 --> 21:16.973
your level of involvement.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.073
So you're firing me?

21:19.140 --> 21:21.173
They haven't made that decision yet.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.240
Okay, but to be clear, I'm
not coming to work tomorrow.

21:24.307 --> 21:27.107
Kirkland's not offering me a position.

21:27.174 --> 21:28.407
And my internship's over.

21:30.940 --> 21:32.873
It's not for me to say, but...

21:36.307 --> 21:39.107
I'll get my things.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.107
I'm sorry, she's out of the office.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.907
Is there someone else
you'd like to talk to?

21:42.974 --> 21:45.240
Or would you like her voice mail?

21:51.775 --> 21:53.707
Once all that stuff is
done, if you have any questions,

21:53.774 --> 21:57.040
just either shoot me an
email, or call me on my cell phone.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.507
Kirkland and Allen, may I help you?

22:54.374 --> 22:56.040
Are you okay?

22:58.907 --> 23:00.207
Okay, let's sit you down.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.440
There you go, okay.

23:06.140 --> 23:07.373
What's going on?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.073
What's the matter?

23:09.140 --> 23:12.106
No, no... Someone needs to call 911!

23:12.174 --> 23:14.207
- Is she okay?
- Just get her some water.

23:15.107 --> 23:16.540
Please get her some water.

23:16.607 --> 23:18.907
Okay, you're fine, okay, okay, okay.

23:18.974 --> 23:21.607
Okay, okay...

23:21.674 --> 23:23.574
I'd like to have a-an
ambulance, please.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.873
Kirkland and Allen.

23:27.174 --> 23:29.374
Okay.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.106
Discredit? You don't have to
discredit her? She's crazy.

23:32.174 --> 23:33.607
She's discrediting herself...

23:33.674 --> 23:36.907
Hang on.

23:36.974 --> 23:38.540
I can't breathe!

23:39.213 --> 23:41.506
- Just get her a glass of water.
- Thank you.

23:41.574 --> 23:43.607
911. Thank you.

23:53.274 --> 23:56.174
Hi, Christine, can you
sit up for me, please?

23:57.640 --> 24:01.240
Could you put your
head up for me, please.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.240
I'm going to put
this over your head, okay?

24:09.607 --> 24:11.573
Just breathe normally...

24:11.640 --> 24:12.606
Calm down.

24:14.140 --> 24:17.073
Try to breathe normally.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.673
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

24:21.874 --> 24:24.140
Just breathe normally. That's good.

24:28.107 --> 24:30.607
Slow your breathing.
