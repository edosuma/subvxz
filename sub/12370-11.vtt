- HELLO, LADIES.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.858
- YOU'RE JIM POWELL?

09:27.942 --> 09:29.277
- YES, I AM.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.028
- I'M NOT GOING TO WIN
AN OSCAR.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.155
[sobs]

09:38.077 --> 09:39.829
- WELL, I GOT NOTHING
OUT OF BENNY.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.497
DID YOU GET ANYTHING
OUT OF JULIE?

09:41.580 --> 09:43.958
- NO. SHE JUST KEPT SAYING
SHE WISHED SHE HAD

09:44.041 --> 09:46.168
AN AMAZING HUSBAND
LIKE YOU.

09:46.252 --> 09:50.172
"OH, NATASHA, HE'S SO WARM
AND CARING AND...SEXY."

09:50.256 --> 09:54.677
- MMM, SO OLD BOB'S
HER KRYPTONITE, EH?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.221
- WELL, OLD JOHN JOHNSON IS.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.057
- YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW
I FEEL MORE LIKE A JACK.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.852
CALL ME JACK.
- NO.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.354
- WELL...MMM!

10:05.438 --> 10:08.190
[gargles]

10:08.274 --> 10:11.360
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S HOW IT'S ALL
GOING TO GO DOWN.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.321
AFTER THE PROPER AMOUNT
OF SEDUCTION,

10:13.404 --> 10:17.116
I'LL SEND JULIE TO THE BATHROOM
FOR HER PRE-LOVEMAKING TOILETTE.

10:19.618 --> 10:23.205
MEANWHILE, I'LL DOWNLOAD
THE CONTENTS OF HER HARD DRIVE.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.709
SO...ON A SCALE
OF EIGHT TO TEN, HOW DO I LOOK?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.843
- 8.01.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.221
- KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS, JOY.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.478
- DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.
YOU HAVE WORK TO DO.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.146
- ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT A KISS FOR LUCK?

10:47.229 --> 10:48.564
- SURE.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.361
YOU GARGLED WITH COLOGNE,
DIDN'T YOU?

10:53.444 --> 10:55.863
- YES, THROAT KIND OF BURNS.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.870
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
HE WAS AFRICAN-AMERICAN

11:02.953 --> 11:04.205
AND IN A WHEELCHAIR?

11:04.288 --> 11:05.915
- HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?

11:05.998 --> 11:09.251
- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW STUFF.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.462
I CAN'T RUN AGAINST HIM.
HOLLYWOOD WILL HATE ME.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.214
I'M--I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO DROP OUT.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.800
- WHAT ABOUT THE DOG PARKS?
- WELL, I'M SORRY,

11:15.883 --> 11:19.095
BUT IF I ATTACK HIM,
I'LL SOUND RACIST AND DISABLIST.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.431
- IT'S NOT RACIST IF YOU
DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.186
- SHH!
DON'T SAY AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.145
[mouths words]

11:32.817 --> 11:35.736
- OH, THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.155
YOU GIVE A WONDERFUL
FOOT MASSAGE.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.448
- THANKS.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.285
I'VE PRACTICED QUITE A BIT
ON MY OWN FEET.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.081
YOU KNOW, YOUR FEET ARE TELLING
ME THAT YOU'RE A LONELY WOMAN.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.583
- OH? WHAT ARE MY BREASTS
TELLING YOU?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.919
- THAT IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY
IN HERE.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.632
- COUNCILMAN POWELL,

11:56.715 --> 12:00.261
I THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE
FOR A HEAPING HELPING

12:00.344 --> 12:02.138
OF OUR HOSPITALITY.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.975
NOW, LET'S JAW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THIS DOG PARK ISSUE.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.726
WHY YOU AGAINST IT?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.314
- LOOK, I THINK
ALL THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

12:12.398 --> 12:15.192
IS THAT I'M A DISABLED
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OHIO STATE

12:15.276 --> 12:16.610
FOOTBALL HERO
THAT BELIEVES CLEVELAND

12:16.694 --> 12:18.237
IS THE BEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.031
- WELL STATED, HERO,
WELL STATED.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.325
- HE DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.995
- AND AS A DISABLED
AFRICAN-AMERICAN FOOTBALL HERO

12:26.078 --> 12:27.830
THAT BELIEVES CLEVELAND
IS THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.540
I JUST HAVE TO WONDER

12:29.623 --> 12:32.793
WHY A PRIVILEGED HOLLYWOOD
ACTRESS IS ATTACKING ME ON AIR.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.714
- MM, AS DO I.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.800
- HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU.
- OH, WELL.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.719
NOW IS PROBABLY
A GOOD TIME TO MENTION

12:41.802 --> 12:44.513
THAT I WAS ONCE MARRIED
TO ERNIE HUDSON,

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
THE PIONEERING
AFRICAN-AMERICAN GHOSTBUSTER.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.521
AND THE GREAT RAY PARKER, JR.
SANG AT OUR WEDDING,

12:52.605 --> 12:56.192
WHICH BROUGHT FLIP WILSON
TO TEARS.

12:56.275 --> 13:01.155
- YOU'RE JUST NAMING
BLACK PEOPLE.

13:01.238 --> 13:04.867
- ARE THEY BLACK?
I DON'T SEE COLOR.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.535
AND I LOVE FOOTBALL.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.162
AND IN FACT,
AFTER ERNIE HUDSON,

13:08.245 --> 13:09.747
I MARRIED A WIDE RECEIVER.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.957
WAS HE BLACK?
DON'T KNOW, DIDN'T NOTICE.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.088
- HOW DID IT GO?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.883
- I DID THE DEED.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.721
AND NOT TO BRAG, BUT IT'S
THE QUICKEST I EVER DID IT.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.975
AT FIRST, I WAS SO NERVOUS,
I STUCK IT IN THE WRONG SLOT.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.272
AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.735
- OH! YOU DOWNLOADED THE FILES.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.238
- YES. ALL THE EVIDENCE WE NEED
FOR A CONVICTION IS ON HERE.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.405
THE POLICE ARE
GOING TO BE THRILLED.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.784
- OH.
- OH. [chuckles]

13:46.867 --> 13:49.036
[sighs]

13:49.119 --> 13:52.206
[sighs]

13:52.289 --> 13:55.084
- YOU KNOW, IT'S SILLY,
BUT...

13:55.167 --> 13:57.878
THE THOUGHT OF YOU
SLEEPING WITH HER

13:57.962 --> 14:00.714
MADE ME A TINY BIT JEALOUS.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.132
- IS THAT SILLY?

14:02.216 --> 14:04.260
THE ENTIRE TIME
I WAS RUBBING HER BUNIONS,

14:04.343 --> 14:07.304
I WAS THINKING OF YOU.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.348
- YOU WERE?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.935
- OH, JOY.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.604
IF I'M GOING TO BE WITH YOU,
I HAVE TO...

14:15.688 --> 14:18.440
BREAK UP PROPERLY
WITH CANADIAN JOY.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.943
- CAN'T YOU JUST DO THAT
IN YOUR HEAD?

14:21.026 --> 14:23.153
- NO.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.738
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.574
YOU HAVE MADE
SOME EXCELLENT POINTS,

14:26.657 --> 14:29.952
COUNCILMAN POWELL,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WHAT?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.246
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST
IF I WITHDREW FROM THIS RACE,

14:32.329 --> 14:35.165
TO SPEND SOME MORE TIME
WITH MY CAREER.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.251
- THEN I'LL BE RUNNING
UNOPPOSED AGAIN.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.919
- NO, YOU WON'T.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.005
I WANT MY DOG PARK.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.423
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

14:42.506 --> 14:46.677
- I'M SAYING
THIS POLISH-AMERICAN...

14:46.760 --> 14:50.014
WHO ESCAPED THE NAZIS...

14:50.097 --> 14:55.352
AND SLEPT WITH FRANK SINATRA...

14:55.436 --> 14:58.814
IS RUNNING AGAINST YOU.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.485
- BRING IT ON.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.654
- I WILL.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.532
- WHOO! DOGGIE!

15:08.616 --> 15:12.786
ELKA OSTROVSKY IS RUNNING
FOR CITY COUNCIL.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.831
IT'S AN <i> ASKAGEDDON</i>
EXCLUSIVE, PEOPLE.

15:15.914 --> 15:21.378
OR SHOULD I SAY
AN "ASK-CLUSIVE"?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.839
NO, I SHOULD NOT.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.181
- YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HANDS, JOY.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.849
- REALLY?

15:33.932 --> 15:35.517
YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE TOO BIG?

15:35.601 --> 15:37.728
- NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.688
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
IS PERFECT.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.399
- AND YOU'RE ADORABLE.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.531
- SO...

15:49.615 --> 15:51.659
DO YOU LIKE TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE

15:51.742 --> 15:54.870
OR DO YOU PREFER THE MALE
TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE?

15:54.953 --> 15:56.538
OR DO YOU--
- I PREFER...

15:56.622 --> 15:57.873
NOT TO TALK
ABOUT THE FIRST MOVE.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.708
THE FIRST MOVE
SHOULD JUST HAPPEN.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.002
- I SEE.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.171
THE LADY MUST BE CAPTURED
BY STEALTH.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.052
[laughs]
SORRY.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.346
IT'S...JUST WHEN YOU GOT
CLOSE LIKE THAT,

16:12.429 --> 16:14.932
YOUR EYES BECAME
ONE GIANT EYE.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.229
- MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY IT
WITH OUR EYES CLOSED.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.939
- YES.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.740
- WELL, THAT WAS NICE.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.744
- YES, THAT WAS...

16:35.828 --> 16:39.289
QUITE NICE.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.583
[sigh]

16:41.667 --> 16:44.086
I DON'T THINK NICE
IS WHAT EITHER OF US WANTS.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.588
- NO.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.716
- I GUESS THE TRUTH IS
I LIKED YOU

16:48.799 --> 16:51.135
'CAUSE YOU WERE OUT OF REACH.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.011
NOW THAT YOU'RE SERVING YOURSELF
UP ON A PLATTER...

16:57.599 --> 16:58.767
YOU KNOW,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.603
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST SHAKE HANDS,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.731
DO IT, AND WALK AWAY.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.443
- OR TWO OUT OF THOSE THREE.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.609
- OH, GOD, JOY.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.944
- WHAT?
- NO, NOT YOU.

17:10.028 --> 17:12.071
MY CANADIAN GIRLFRIEND JOY.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.406
- YOU REALLY HAVE
A CANADIAN GIRLFRIEND?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.452
- YES.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.953
HI, JOY, THIS IS BOB.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.329
I HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
LOOK.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.998
I'M JUMPING
ON THE NEXT FLIGHT

17:21.080 --> 17:22.624
AND THEN THE CONNECTING FLIGHT

17:22.708 --> 17:24.960
AND THEN THE PUDDLE JUMPER
AND THEN THE SNOWMOBILE AND...

17:25.042 --> 17:27.421
THEN I'LL BE AT YOUR DOOR.
YES.

17:27.503 --> 17:31.300
I'LL SEE YOU IN TWO WEEKS.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.136
- WELL, FOLKS, SEEMS LIKE WE GOT
ANOTHER TROUBLED SOUL

17:34.219 --> 17:35.512
ON THE LINE.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.514
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

17:37.598 --> 17:38.849
- HI, MELANIE?

17:38.932 --> 17:40.851
IT'S NATASHA.

17:40.934 --> 17:45.439
- OH, HEY.
YOU OKAY...NATASHA?

17:45.522 --> 17:48.567
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.652
I KIND OF HAVE A HISTORY
OF BEING ATTRACTED

17:50.736 --> 17:53.113
TO NOT-SO-GOOD GUYS.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.824
BUT TONIGHT I TOOK A CHANCE.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
I WENT AFTER A REALLY GOOD GUY.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.330
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?
- DIDN'T WORK OUT.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.333
SOMEHOW I'M SITTING HERE,
WONDERING IF I'M DESTINED

18:04.416 --> 18:07.127
TO END UP ALONE BECAUSE
I'M ATTRACTED TO THE WRONG MEN.

18:07.211 --> 18:11.006
- OH, HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.008
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET--LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

18:13.091 --> 18:16.512
WHEN PEOPLE ARE STUCK
IN BAD PATTERNS,

18:16.595 --> 18:19.515
IT'S BECAUSE, ON SOME LEVEL,
IT GIVES THEM SOMETHING.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.183
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE UP

18:21.266 --> 18:22.184
TO DATE A NICE GUY?

18:22.267 --> 18:25.687
- WOW. GIVE UP?
I...

18:25.771 --> 18:30.317
I GUESS...I'D HAVE
TO GIVE UP THE EXCUSE

18:30.400 --> 18:33.362
THAT WHEN IT ENDS,
IT'S ALWAYS HIS FAULT.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.697
- AND COULD YOU GIVE THAT UP?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.407
- I WOULD LIKE TO.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.537
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT TONIGHT
REALLY TAUGHT ME IS THAT...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.705
I'M READY FOR A GOOD GUY.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.541
- OH, THAT'S GREAT, JOY.

18:45.624 --> 18:51.213
I MEAN, I-I FEEL GREAT JOY
FOR YOU, NATASHA.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.590
- THANKS, MELANIE.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.593
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.
BYE.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.847
- YOU KNOW?
I AM GOOD AT THIS.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.641
I MEAN...
WHEN I'M JUST BEING MYSELF.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.812
SEE, I WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO BE
MORE FOLKSY, OR <i> HONEY BOO BOO.</i>

19:06.895 --> 19:08.730
BUT PEOPLE LIKE THOSE SHOWS

19:08.814 --> 19:11.775
BECAUSE
THEY'RE BEING THEMSELVES.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.319
SO, FOR THE REST OF <i> ASKAGEDDON,</i>

19:14.403 --> 19:16.488
I'M JUST GOING TO BE ME,
AND I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.410
AND THAT CONCLUDES <i> ASKAGEDDON.</i>

19:21.493 --> 19:22.494
SEE YOU TOMORROW, FOLKS.
I HOPE.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.918
- SO THEY DIDN'T FIRE YOU.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.297
- NO, IT SEEMS 24 HOURS
OF FOLKSY MELANIE

19:33.380 --> 19:35.757
MADE PEOPLE REALIZE HOW MUCH
THEY LIKE REGULAR MELANIE.

19:35.841 --> 19:40.721
I PROPOSED
SEXY MELANIE AFTER DARK.

19:40.804 --> 19:44.224
- DON'T DO THAT.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.977
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THE STATION MANAGER SAID.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.562
- I'M GLAD YOU KEPT YOUR JOB.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.398
SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON
TO CELEBRATE.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.442
- MM-HMM.
- AND LOOK AT THIS TURNOUT.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.736
- YOU KNOW, ELKA'S ONLY A FEW
SIGNATURES AWAY

19:55.819 --> 19:57.279
FROM GETTING ON THE BALLOT.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.782
AND HER DOG PARK TWITTER ACCOUNT
IS TRENDING.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.201
- @ELKASTOPLESSPARKS.

20:06.705 --> 20:10.459
- LOOK AT THAT, IT LOOKS LIKE
"ELKA'S TOPLESS PARKS."

20:10.542 --> 20:14.630
- DOES IT?

20:14.713 --> 20:17.007
- WELL, JOY, I'VE GOT
A PLANE TO CATCH.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.135
- BOB'S SELLING THE AGENCY
AND MOVING BACK TO CANADA.

20:20.218 --> 20:22.804
- I MADE THE NEW OWNER PROMISE
TO KEEP JOY ON.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.431
HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY.
- GOOD GUY, HUH?

20:24.514 --> 20:25.641
- YEP.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.810
I GUESS WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE HIM,
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.938
- OOH.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.648
- I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.275
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT, JOY.
LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING.
