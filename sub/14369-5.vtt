Of course not.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.368
No, we're waiting for Darren.

No thanks necessary.

Dearest Clarice,
when you grow up

and your heart is broken like
it's never been broken before,

04:25.682 --> 04:29.686

to show you...

04:46.577 --> 04:49.664
That you should never
invite your mother?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.541
No, no, that you

to Darren.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.883
I would never throw myself
out of a window,

05:00.967 --> 05:01.968
no matter how bad the party was.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.303
Darren,
Dodie is right.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.264
You need to go so we
can finish planning.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.767
Come on,
I'm still grieving for Lucinda.

05:09.851 --> 05:10.727
Darren...

05:10.810 --> 05:13.730
{\an5}Fine, but this
had better mean
that my party

05:13.813 --> 05:15.565
turns out better
than Clarice's.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.066
It will.

05:17.150 --> 05:17.525
That's a promise.

Ginger, do you realize
that anyone that matters

05:22.905 --> 05:24.699
will be here
at your party?

05:24.782 --> 05:26.826
Not long ago a party
at the Foutley house

05:26.909 --> 05:29.746
wouldn't have even blipped
on the junior-high radar.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.248

and the bad.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.922
Don't remind me.

So, um, what do you guys think
I should do about party favors?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.492
That is
not fair.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.701
Listen here...

08:55.785 --> 08:57.328
Let a dying woman speak, Lois.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.289
{\an1}Dr. Dave has made it
clear to me

09:00.373 --> 09:03.167
{\an1}that stress could be
the cause of my condition,

09:03.251 --> 09:04.126
and like it or not,

09:04.210 --> 09:07.380
you and your family are
the cause of my stress.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.632
{\an1}So from now until
the end of my days,

09:09.715 --> 09:11.634
{\an1}I forbid--
and I repeat,<i> forbid--</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:13.970
{\an1}my family
from interacting

09:14.053 --> 09:15.846
with any member
of your family.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.724
What?! Whoa!

09:18.808 --> 09:21.811
{\an1}If I'm going to survive
this cruel world,

09:21.894 --> 09:25.481
{\an1}it's going to be
without a Foutley in my midst.

09:25.564 --> 09:26.399
Mom...

09:26.482 --> 09:28.484
{\an1}Not now,
Deirdre Hortense.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.318
{\an1}I'm sure you
and your brother

09:29.402 --> 09:32.029
will thank me for this someday.

09:32.113 --> 09:32.655
Come on.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.535
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>Here it is,</i>
<i>two days before I host</i>

09:37.618 --> 09:40.371
<i>the most important party</i>
<i>of my entire life,</i>

09:40.454 --> 09:43.082
<i>and one of my oldest friends</i>
<i>can't be there,</i>

09:43.165 --> 09:44.625
<i>which begs the question:</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:48.170
<i>Do I call off the party</i>
<i>or do I have it without Dodie?</i>

09:48.254 --> 09:50.172
{\an5}CARL:
This is Jelly Bean
calling for Cottontail.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.883
Come in, Cottontail. Over.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.345
{\an5}CARL (<i> on walkie-talkie</i> ):
This is Jelly Bean calling
for Cottontail.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.722
How do you read?

09:57.805 --> 09:59.515
What are you doing?

09:59.598 --> 10:02.184
Hoods, we have 17 baskets
to make by tomorrow morning.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.687
This isn't a good idea, Carl.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.523
My mom could go like that if she
knew I was even talking to you.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.817
CARL (<i> on walkie-talkie</i> ):
Your mom is faking it.

10:09.900 --> 10:10.776
I've seen that act
a hundred times.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.362
Now, I need your help
delivering these orders.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.324
Meet me here at my house
at 9:00 a.m.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.742
HOODSEY:
I can't risk it, Carl.

10:17.825 --> 10:18.701
{\an5}What do you mean?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.494
We have business obligations.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.370
She's my mother.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.372
I don't want to lose her, okay?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.708
{\an5}CARL:
But what about
Hoodsey's Karaoke Den?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.461
{\an5}HOODSEY:
That dream
will have to die, Carl.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.546
Oh! I didn't mean to say "die"!

10:30.629 --> 10:31.714
Never mind.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.923
Over and out.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.092
(<i> static crackling</i> )

10:35.176 --> 10:37.345
(<i> rustling</i> )

10:37.928 --> 10:40.389
Dodie, it's me,
Macie--

10:40.473 --> 10:42.016
Macie Lightfoot.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.684
Macie?

10:45.186 --> 10:47.146
{\an1}Macie, you're not banned
at my house.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.606
{\an1}You could use
the front door.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.233
{\an1}Oh, I guess I got caught up
in the drama.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.401
Tell me every detail.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.154
{\an1}I want to know
what everyone said

10:55.237 --> 10:57.114
{\an1}when they found out Ginger
was canceling the party.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.909
Um, Dode,
I'm not sure

10:59.992 --> 11:02.870
Ginger is planning
on canceling the party.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.247
What?!

11:05.331 --> 11:08.084
How could she consider
having that party without me?

11:08.167 --> 11:11.128
Well, technically
it is Darren's birthday party,

11:11.212 --> 11:12.755
and Darren is her boyfriend.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.340
{\an1}Well, yeah,
but this party

11:14.423 --> 11:16.425
{\an1}is also <i> the</i> most important
BFF thing to happen

11:16.509 --> 11:19.512
{\an1}since we got
to buy training bras.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.555
That was one
of my darker days.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.516
Macie Lightfoot, you tell Ginger

11:23.599 --> 11:26.352
that if she cared one iota
for our friendship,

11:26.435 --> 11:28.479
she would cancel this party!

11:30.022 --> 11:32.566
It's a miracle
you survived that fall, Lucinda.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.234
Hmm, uh-uh.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.152
Don't try to talk.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.654
{\an1}When those bandages
come off,

11:36.737 --> 11:38.280
{\an1}you'll be
as beautiful as ever.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.198
(<i> muffled moans</i> )

11:39.281 --> 11:41.659
{\an1}Oh, kiss me,
Lucinda.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.953
{\an1}Open that broken jaw
and kiss me.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.080
(<i> Lucinda moaning</i> )

11:46.163 --> 11:49.333
Oh, my goodness,

11:49.417 --> 11:51.794
I can't believe they show this
in the middle of the day.

11:51.877 --> 11:52.795
Here you go.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.088
That is skim milk, right?

11:54.171 --> 11:56.590
{\an1}I don't need any dairy fat
clogging my arteries.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.633
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

11:57.716 --> 11:59.176
{\an1}Rest your arteries,
I'll get it.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.302
We're not buying

12:00.386 --> 12:03.013
{\an1}any more magazine
subscriptions.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.515
Okay.

12:06.350 --> 12:10.521
I'm looking for
a Hoods P. Bishop.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.815
Are you out
of your mind, Carl?

12:12.898 --> 12:14.525
I have a weak patient
in there.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.485
{\an1}Hoods, we stand to miss out
on some serious cake

12:16.569 --> 12:19.196
{\an1}if we don't deliver
those baskets.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.990
{\an1}We're sitting
on a gold mine.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.993
{\an1}Well, I'm sitting with
a heart-challenged mother

12:24.076 --> 12:25.494
{\an1}who says it's
because of you.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.413

12:30.916 --> 12:31.917

12:32.001 --> 12:33.335
she'll find out.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.462
{\an1}She can smell you
on me.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.131
{\an1}She's like a doberman
that way.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.009
So you're ending our friendship
over a fake heart attack?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.719
I guess so.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.264
Maybe it's time for you
to move on, okay?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.433
Don't call or write
or anything.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.519
It'll only
make it worse.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.562
Just forget I exist.

13:18.797 --> 13:19.840
<i>It's Ginger.</i>

13:19.924 --> 13:21.884
COURTNEY (<i> on phone</i> ):
Hello, Ginger.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.887
We aren't playing childish games
at the party, right?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.722
Oh, no, of course not.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.556
But about the party.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.058
I need an unbiased opinion.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.060
Continue.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.728
Okay, well, Dodie's mom
and my mom had a fight

13:32.811 --> 13:35.856
{\an1}at the Bag-It-Yourself
Bargain Basement...

13:35.940 --> 13:37.566
Back story;
cut to the chase.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.567
Um, since then,

13:38.651 --> 13:40.986
her mom decided
that my family

13:41.070 --> 13:41.820
{\an1}is sort of
off limits to Dodie,

13:41.904 --> 13:44.740
{\an1}which means she can't
come to the party,

13:44.823 --> 13:45.991
{\an1}and she really
wanted to.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.076
{\an3}And?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.577
{\an1}And now that
she can't come,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.247
she wants me to call off
the whole thing, and...

13:51.330 --> 13:52.039
I don't know
if I should.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.583
Ginger, let me make this
crystal clear:

13:54.667 --> 13:56.293
It would be
a gigantic mistake

13:56.377 --> 13:58.087
{\an1}to cancel a party that
everyone is talking about.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.089
{\an1}I know.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.590
{\an1}But it feels disloyal
to have the party

14:01.674 --> 14:04.510
if my oldest friend
wants me to cancel.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.220
{\an1}And what if
I just postpone?

14:06.303 --> 14:07.429
Darren will understand.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.430
{\an3}Will he?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.848
On his birthday,
no less?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.475
Ginger... a girl must
never put the feelings

14:11.559 --> 14:14.436
of an overly
dramatic girlfriend

14:14.520 --> 14:17.147
{\an1}before the feelings of her
loving and doting boyfriend.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.275
People might talk.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.277
But it feels like
a stab at Dodie.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.736
Dodie's a big girl,
and she stabbed you

14:22.820 --> 14:26.323
in the back once before,
if my memory serves.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.449
{\an1}I guess.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.034
Aren't you glad
you called?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.786
Can't wait for
your party tomorrow.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.997
I'm all about
wide-leg palazzos

14:33.080 --> 14:34.164
with ruffled cuffs.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.249
Good to know.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.668
Thanks, Courtney.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.337
I can't believe the only party
I've ever thrown

14:40.421 --> 14:43.591
is turning out to be
such a gigantic disaster.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.886
{\an1}DARREN:
Hey!

14:49.096 --> 14:50.931
Hi.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.141
Thanks for
meeting me here.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.977
No problem-- but why
the coded directions?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.646
My mom's banned
your family, too.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.523
You're kind of
Ginger-adjacent.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.483
Darren, I need
to ask you a favor.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.151
{\an1}Shoot.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.320
Would you mind asking Ginger

15:04.403 --> 15:05.779
to cancel the party?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.448
Dodie, come on...

15:07.531 --> 15:08.574
She'll listen
to you.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.618
{\an1}Look-- Ginger
doesn't feel good

15:10.701 --> 15:12.328
{\an1}about having this party
without you,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.496
but it's my birthday

15:14.580 --> 15:16.874
{\an1}and she's excited
everybody's talking about it.

15:16.957 --> 15:17.625
{\an1}It doesn't seem fair
to cancel

15:17.708 --> 15:20.252
{\an1}because of
a war between mothers.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.670
I thought
you might say that.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.713
It would mean a lot
if you told Ginger

15:22.796 --> 15:25.591
it's okay with you
to have this party.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.760
But it's not okay
with me, Darren.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.053
In the old days,

15:29.136 --> 15:32.389
{\an1}Ginger would have never put
a party before her BFFs.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.850
But now that she has
a boyfriend,

15:34.933 --> 15:36.435
she doesn't care
anymore.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.686
Well, she does
so care, but...

15:37.770 --> 15:40.939
{\an4}If she cared,
she would call it off.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.358
{\an1}Hey, now, that's
totally one-sided, Dodie.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.360
You know, Darren,

15:44.443 --> 15:46.070
{\an1}you used to be
a much better friend

15:46.153 --> 15:48.447
before all this started
between you and Ginger.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.032
{\an1}You used to
actually listen,

15:50.115 --> 15:51.867
{\an1}and you didn't rush
to take sides.

15:51.950 --> 15:55.788
But now all you ever do is
defend Ginger-- no matter what!

15:55.871 --> 15:59.124
Ginger doesn't even
know I'm here.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.084
I came for you.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.336
You know, you say
Ginger doesn't care

16:02.419 --> 16:03.379
about the BFFs anymore.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.713
But what about you?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.216
You only care
about yourself--

16:07.299 --> 16:08.133
and you're
missing a <i> party!</i>

16:11.512 --> 16:13.597
Just forget
I said anything.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.556
Okay, Darren?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.016
Happy birthday.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.146
(<i> sobbing</i> )

16:21.230 --> 16:23.482
I could get used
to this lifestyle.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.775
I beats cleaning
bedpans.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.777
{\an1}Okay, the next house is
the Bouviers'.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.738
{\an1}You're going to have
to sing the song

16:29.822 --> 16:30.656
in French this time.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.409
Look, Carl, you'll get
one language out of me,

16:33.492 --> 16:34.159
that's it.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.912
Hoodsey would have
sung it in French.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.123
Hoodsey has more
panache than I do.

16:39.206 --> 16:39.581
(<i> brakes squeak</i> )

16:39.665 --> 16:41.625
Well, hello, Lois.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.919
I didn't know this was
your bunny trail.

16:44.002 --> 16:45.170
{\an1}Oh...

Uh, well, hmm...

16:46.380 --> 16:49.049

Carl's business partner.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.092
Ah, yes, JoAnn.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.135
Uh...

16:51.218 --> 16:52.761
{\an1}I just got through
looking at her lab results.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.472
You were right--
her heart's just fine.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.392
It's an esophageal
hernia.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.727
I knew it!

16:59.810 --> 17:02.020
Come on,
we're taking a ride.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.606
You got to give JoAnn
this news right away--

17:04.690 --> 17:05.607
and I want to watch.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.609
With any luck she'll call off
this family feud

17:08.694 --> 17:11.280
and I can spare
whatever dignity I have left.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.240
But, Mom, you're
the Easter bunny.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.992
{\an1}You can't
just leave me.

17:27.628 --> 17:28.964
Hey, weren't
you working

17:29.048 --> 17:29.256
for Carl
and Hoodsey?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.049
Yep.

17:31.133 --> 17:31.967
{\an1}But our flair was
unwelcome,

17:32.050 --> 17:35.262
so Mr. Licorice and me
struck out on our own.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.139
Never can keep
a good chick down.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.974
That's for sure.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.852
Well, we have three more

That's

17:59.912 --> 18:02.664
Chill, Macie, it's
one piece of dough.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.750
Sorry, I lost my head.

18:04.833 --> 18:05.959
I'm just a little off

18:06.043 --> 18:06.919
with all this conflict
in the air.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.505
But you're doing
the right thing

18:09.588 --> 18:10.756
by having the party,
Ginger.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.634
Ugh... that's what
everybody says.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.929
But why doesn't that make me
feel any better?

18:17.012 --> 18:18.889
Ginger! Macie!

18:18.972 --> 18:19.932
{\an3}Darren!

18:20.015 --> 18:20.849
{\an1}What's up?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.017
You won't believe

18:22.100 --> 18:24.520
the idea I got from
a kid in a chicken suit.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.980
Courtney advised us
against party games, Darren.

18:27.064 --> 18:27.898
No, no, no, no,
look, look, look.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.900
There are two ways
to face a problem:

18:29.983 --> 18:33.153
You either throw in the towel
and give up

18:33.237 --> 18:35.197
like Lucinda did
when Dirk left her

18:35.280 --> 18:36.532
or you dust yourself off

18:36.615 --> 18:38.075
{\an1}and face your problem
head on

18:38.158 --> 18:39.493
like the singing chick did

18:39.576 --> 18:40.369
{\an1}when he started
his own business.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.120
Yeah...

18:42.204 --> 18:43.372
Well, don't you get it?

18:43.455 --> 18:44.832
If we want Dodie to be here
for the party,

18:44.915 --> 18:47.543
{\an1}it's up to us
to make it happen.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.128
{\an5}You mean defy
Mrs. Bishop's
demands?

18:50.212 --> 18:51.421
If that's
what it takes.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.214
No, Darren,

18:52.297 --> 18:55.425
{\an1}Mrs. Bishop is
a very unstable lady.

18:55.509 --> 18:59.137
I know... which is why
we may have to do this

18:59.221 --> 19:01.056
secret-agent style.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.276
{\an1}(<i> whispering</i> ):
You go first.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.331
(<i> thudding, moaning</i> )

19:27.541 --> 19:28.750
Oh, hi, Dode.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.919
{\an1}Ginger?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.172
{\an4}Aren't you
getting ready
for your party?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.047
{\an3}I am.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.549
What are you
doing here?

19:35.632 --> 19:37.301
I'm not having it
without you.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.594
We're here
to bust you out.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.761
{\an1}(<i> gasps</i> )

19:39.845 --> 19:40.554
Oh, Ginger!

19:40.637 --> 19:41.430
(<i> moaning</i> )

19:41.513 --> 19:44.433
We're stuck.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.853
{\an1}But we're going to need
another escape route.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.984
If it weren't
for the floppy ears,

19:54.067 --> 19:56.612
{\an1}I'm sure my blood pressure
would soar right now.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.779
(<i> laughs</i> )

19:57.863 --> 20:00.782
Hey, good one,
Mrs. Foutley.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.784
{\an1}JoAnn, I've looked over
the results of your tests--

20:02.868 --> 20:04.786
your heart is fine.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.580
{\an1}What you're
suffering from is

20:06.663 --> 20:07.956
{\an1}an overactive
bile duct.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.459
{\an1}Nothing a sensible diet
won't keep in check.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.668
Really?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.421
Well... well,
isn't that good news?

20:14.504 --> 20:15.631
Oh, I'm so relieved!

20:15.714 --> 20:20.802
Look, I'm sorry if a little
tug of war caused you any harm,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.638
and as far as my family
causing you stress,

20:22.721 --> 20:24.932
I'm sorry for that, too.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.016
JoAnn, you don't
have to like me,

20:26.099 --> 20:29.144
but you can't go on
stopping our kids

20:29.227 --> 20:29.728
from having fun together.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.648
Face it, they're a posse.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.318
Well, I... I guess I overreacted
in the face of death.

20:36.401 --> 20:40.364
I... I don't know what came
over me in that supermarket.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.867
{\an5}And as far as
my condemnation of
your family goes,

20:43.951 --> 20:46.536
I suspect it
isn't always Carl

20:46.620 --> 20:47.871
at the head of trouble.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.498
I know my Robert Joseph has

20:49.581 --> 20:51.250
a touch of the devil
in him, too.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.043
And I don't have
a single reason

20:53.126 --> 20:55.504
to fault Ginger
in any of this.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.589
{\an1}So you'll let Dodie come
to the big shindig tonight?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.841
We're serving ham.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.469
I-I don't see why not.

21:02.552 --> 21:03.345
Deirdre Hortense!

21:03.428 --> 21:04.930
You'd better get
a move on

21:05.013 --> 21:07.015
if you want to get
to Ginger's party!

21:07.099 --> 21:07.891

Thanks, Mom!

Hallelujah!

21:11.937 --> 21:15.524
Don't forget the ears!

of delivering,
