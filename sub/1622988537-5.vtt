WEBVTT

00:24.107 --> 00:25.067
Can we take a break?

00:25.150 --> 00:26.944
Sweet, sweet freedom.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.781
Do you think he followed us?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.033
I don't think anyone saw us
get in the dumbwaiter,

00:33.116 --> 00:35.077
much less come out of the mansion.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.079
I think I might not be agoraphobic.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.373
Is it weird that I'm disappointed?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.208
Guys, we left our backpacks.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.168
What are we gonna do about this?

00:44.127 --> 00:46.046
I know someone we can talk to.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.270
Oh, boy.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.814
What is it this time?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.775
It's an old flight recorder,

01:06.859 --> 01:09.403
but we need your help to figure out
what's on it.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.656
Please. It's urgent.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.492
All right.

01:18.829 --> 01:19.913
Come on.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.709
How did you get this?

01:24.501 --> 01:26.128
We're very entrepreneurial.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.006
Uh-huh. You're not gonna tell me, are you?

01:29.590 --> 01:32.926
Look, we think someone
might be trying to cover up a plane crash.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.972
Can you help us... unofficially?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.100
Please?

01:42.769 --> 01:45.272
Fine. My dad has a friend at NTSB.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.609
But keep this on the DL for now.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.070
And if it turns out
that there is anything crazy on this,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.157
you gotta tell me
where you found it, okay?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.461
Dad. Dad.
Dad, you're never going to believe--

02:08.544 --> 02:11.381
Oh, just dial it down
a little bit, all right.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.051
-Pop-Pop's trying to sleep.
-Okay.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.178
Well, you know,
I went back to Woodruff Mansion.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.722
You know,
the place with the creepy marked door?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.891
Here, come sit down.
I wanna show you something.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.519
Yeah, sit.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.647
-All right, check this out.
-Mm-hmm.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.398
All right, you see these guys?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.817
These are all Pop-Pop's friends
from back in the day.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.070
Yeah, you know,
I tried to track some of them down

02:33.153 --> 02:34.947
and see if maybe
they would come visit Pop-Pop.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.573
-You know, maybe cheer him up.
-Mm-hmm.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.117
Yeah, but they've all gone. All of 'em.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.203
Yeah, everyone except Junior.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.792
Gone?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.461
Yeah. They all died, honey.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.717
Now, I think you were right
about Pop-Pop. I do.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.679
These men,
they were all sick way too young.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.473
All right,
I don't think that's a coincidence.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.977
You know, I can't help thinking
that something happened, you know.

03:05.060 --> 03:09.189
Something in this town affected 'em.
Maybe even hurt some of 'em.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.569
Yeah. There's a story here.
Yeah, I think you should dig into it.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.238
Maybe it'll help Pop-Pop.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.490
I will.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.701
I can fix this.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.414
I know I can.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.254
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.965
What were you trying to say
when you came in?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.803
Yeah. So Donny and Spoon and I
went back to the mansion,

03:39.887 --> 03:41.597
took a dumbwaiter into the basement.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.266
Then there was an airplane there,
so we took the black box,

03:44.349 --> 03:47.936
but somebody almost caught us
and then I lost my backpack.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.901
Wait, what?

04:23.555 --> 04:25.098
I still can't believe you're here.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.558
I mean, is it really you?

04:27.142 --> 04:29.937
Quick, tell me something
only the real Ethan would know.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.191
I once showed you a cat video

04:34.274 --> 04:36.985
that made you laugh so hard
you couldn't breathe,

04:37.069 --> 04:39.821
so then you started crying
for 20 minutes straight.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.782
Super embarrassing for you.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.623
Well, is it weird to be back?

04:50.666 --> 04:53.085
A little. It's mostly awesome though.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.630
I mean, things aren't great
with my mom and dad.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.465
Yeah. I'm sorry.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.385
It's okay. I'm just happy
to be sitting here with you.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.475
All right.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.645
Well, just let me know if they
recover anything from the recorder.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.438
Yeah.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.067
And thanks, Dad.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.195
I appreciate it.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.162
You know, for a cop,
you really suck at tailing people.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.792
I'm sorry.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.964
And I'm sorry for losing my temper.

05:40.716 --> 05:44.469
You jumped to the worst possible
conclusion so quickly, Frank.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.471
I would never cheat on you.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.349
Yeah, but you'd leave Erie Harbor
without talking to me about it.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.810
I would've talked to you about it.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.645
What would you have said?

05:53.729 --> 05:56.648
For the right job? Yes.

05:58.901 --> 05:59.902
Cool.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.821
Look, if you have something to say--

06:02.905 --> 06:06.200
-Frank, just tell me how you feel.
-How I feel?

06:06.283 --> 06:10.329
I feel like I wish I hadn't been carrying
a ring around this entire time

06:10.412 --> 06:12.664
waiting for the right time
to propose to you.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.708
What?

06:16.543 --> 06:17.544
Frank.

06:18.921 --> 06:19.922
Wait, don't--

06:20.839 --> 06:24.134
Are you gonna drive off?
Are you seriously gonna just--

06:32.267 --> 06:33.852
How's your report going?

06:34.645 --> 06:37.397
Can we give you access
to anything else you may need?

06:37.940 --> 06:40.025
Well, I'm nearly done with it, actually.

06:41.610 --> 06:45.113
But I'm afraid you might not like
some of the conclusions

06:45.197 --> 06:46.573
that I'm gonna draw in it.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.828
I do think we're making progress here.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.249
I mean, it's slow going, but things
move a little slower in small towns.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.126
I think you did the right thing,
firing those deputies.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.046
Well, it seemed important
to send a message.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.007
Yeah, there is no place
for racist behavior like that.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.177
-Not even in small towns, as you say.
-Mm-hmm.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.516
But... the fact that it happened at all

07:12.599 --> 07:14.893
speaks to a lack of respect
for your leadership,

07:14.977 --> 07:18.605
which is perhaps bigger than you.
Bigger than all this.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.526
-Well, racism, it's pretty big.
-Don't take this the wrong way,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.487
but maybe this town isn't ready for you.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.489
Is something funny?

07:27.573 --> 07:31.535
I'm sorry. I just-- I thought we were
gonna keep talking in coded language.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.580
You're good at what you do.
I was just trying to help.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.081
What? Help me quit?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.419
See, you haven't been here long enough...

07:41.795 --> 07:43.338
to know I don't do that.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.681
Mm-hmm.

07:57.394 --> 08:01.190
There has to be a connection between
these men. Something that made them sick.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.567
Did they all touch the photograph?

08:03.650 --> 08:07.237
I'm just saying, maybe we should
sanitize it just to be safe.

08:07.321 --> 08:12.117
Each of us should pick three names.
Try to do a deep dive into their lives.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.286
Try to figure out
what the missing link is.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.958
Did someone steal all your clothes
or something?

08:20.042 --> 08:21.043
What?

08:23.212 --> 08:25.506
Sometimes I'm just not in the mood, okay?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.640
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey, I just started reading this,

08:35.724 --> 08:38.352
like, yesterday and I'm already
halfway done with it. It's so good.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.312
Yay. You know, when you finish that

08:40.395 --> 08:43.649
we should read Pride and Prejudice
together and do awful British accents.

08:44.316 --> 08:48.195
"You must allow me to tell you
how ardently I admire and love you."

08:50.113 --> 08:51.114
What?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.784
You know, Mr. Darcy.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.119
Oh, is he, like,
one of the new history teachers?

08:58.121 --> 09:00.082
Okay. Bye.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.753
Wait. Are you busy later?

09:04.837 --> 09:07.464
I was wondering if maybe we could
watch a movie or something.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.549
It's all right.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.342
'Kay.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.033
Just trying to find out more
about Pop-Pop and his friends,

09:35.117 --> 09:37.578
but I feel like I'm just going in circles.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.376
Dad, did you get anything new?

09:45.127 --> 09:46.962
Uh-uh. Nope, nothing.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.340
No, but I am still waiting to hear back
from some people.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.939
I feel like he's shaking more.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.608
Me too.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.865
I meant Walter.

10:19.411 --> 10:23.081
Hey, girls. Can you tell Principal Collins
that I got her message,

10:23.165 --> 10:25.584
and I'm gonna run a quick errand?
I'll come back and talk to her.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.004
My God, Mom. It's called a text message.
Why don't you just text her yourself

10:29.087 --> 10:31.006
so we don't have to walk
all the way across Earth

10:31.089 --> 10:34.635
and, like, talk to Principal Collins
and walk all the way back across Earth?

10:35.135 --> 10:37.804
I'm sorry if I enjoy
real human connection.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.852
Are you okay, Iz?

10:43.936 --> 10:46.396
You're doing that thing you do
when you're nervous.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.732
What thing? Yeah, I'm fine.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.359
Yeah, I swear I'm not nervous.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.279
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.365
Like, I thought Emma and I
were, like, friends now,

10:56.448 --> 10:58.408
but I feel like
she's been acting weird lately.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.285
I don't know.
Do you think maybe she likes you?

11:00.369 --> 11:02.246
I don't think so.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.957
Okay, so you're not, like,
getting a vibe off her or anything?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.834
Well, how would I know
if there was a vibe?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.337
Okay, what did she say
that made you think she was mad at you?

11:10.420 --> 11:12.130
Nothing. She's just so hot and cold.

11:12.214 --> 11:15.467
You know, like, one minute we're talking
and the next minute she ghosts me.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.886
-So she is talking to you?
-God, no.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.097
You're focusing on
all the wrong things here, Ethan.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.975
It's not what she's saying,
it's how she's saying it.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.227
-Okay.
-Don't patronize me.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.813
I'm not. I'm just wondering if maybe--

11:27.896 --> 11:30.399
if it's possible
that you might just be imagining it?

11:30.482 --> 11:33.944
Like, the worst-case scenario?
Because sometimes you do that.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.196
-Hi.
-Hey.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.995
-See?
-Sort of.

11:45.998 --> 11:48.041
Come on, dude, look at this kid.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.003
You're telling me this isn't
the funniest thing you've seen this year?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.963
Like, these earmuffs too, yo?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.174
Nothing else I can say, bro. Get out.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.634
Let's go.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.512
-Girls' section.
-Like his earrings.

12:00.596 --> 12:01.680
You okay?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.017
Never better.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.562
If this were an interview,
I'd say the source appeared to be lying.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.064
Not everything is about
The Magic Hour Chronicle

12:11.148 --> 12:13.567
-or journalism or whatever.
-Spoon, wait.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.989
You know you can talk to me, right?
Off the record.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.117
Afternoon, comrades.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.828
-I'll catch up with you guys later.
-Dude, what?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.413
Is it because I said comrades?

12:32.044 --> 12:34.838
I think one of the older kids
was being mean to Spoon.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.842
I want a name and an address.
I'm gonna send a strongly-worded letter.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.225
Found nothing on Bob or Theo,
and only a few articles on Kenny.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.852
It's like none of these guys
were ever on the Internet.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.979
Okay, so let's start small.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.609
I've realized I barely know anything
about my own Pop-Pop.

12:56.818 --> 13:00.405
People are vast, Hilde.
They contain multitudes.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.908
Or at least
that's what the documentary said.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.077
Anyway...

13:06.828 --> 13:10.123
Exactly. So let's start with him.

13:11.083 --> 13:15.546
Sylvester Lisko. We need to search through
everything we can find on him.

13:16.255 --> 13:19.967
And then maybe I'll find the missing piece
in a place I wasn't expecting.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.012
Read this. I think it might be a lead.

14:12.311 --> 14:14.271
My Pop-Pop worked for Strata?

14:20.736 --> 14:24.031
I wanted to find out what Pop-Pop
and his fishing buddies had in common

14:24.114 --> 14:26.742
that could've made them sick,
but I found a lot more.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.870
-Yeah.
-Yeah, we can see that.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.372
Did you know Pop-Pop
was a volunteer firefighter?

14:32.456 --> 14:36.084
No. No, I did not.
No, he never talked about that.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.254
Did you know that he also managed
the Erie Harbor softball team

14:39.338 --> 14:40.839
for six straight seasons?

14:40.923 --> 14:42.716
He played first base.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.177
This is amazing, Matt.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.889
Yeah. Yeah, wow. I know.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.767
So much about him that I didn't--

14:52.601 --> 14:55.604
I-- You know--
He didn't let anyone in on him.

14:55.687 --> 14:59.858
So I was thinking we could
bring him in here, show him all this,

14:59.942 --> 15:04.404
and maybe see if he remembers anything
from when he worked at Strata.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.699
I think that's the missing piece.

15:08.825 --> 15:09.910
Yeah, Hilde, I...

15:09.993 --> 15:13.956
Honey, this is wonderful.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.333
It's a beautiful thing.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.377
But you--

15:19.336 --> 15:25.676
You know how Pop-Pop can
sometimes seem frustrated and upset

15:25.759 --> 15:28.303
when he can't remember things, right?

15:28.387 --> 15:29.763
-Right.
-Yeah.

15:29.847 --> 15:34.518
Right, I mean, this is
a beautiful tribute to his life, Scout.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.144
Wow.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.731
You know, I just think, you know,
hitting him with it all at once,

15:40.524 --> 15:42.734
that might not go the way you want it to.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.736
But we have to try.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.489
I'm trying to help him,
and we're running out of time.

15:47.573 --> 15:50.200
Okay, yeah,
well, maybe we could show it to him

15:50.284 --> 15:54.121
-like it's a nice memory, right?
-Yeah, yeah, but just not pressure him.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.372
Yeah. Yeah, right.

15:55.998 --> 15:59.126
You know, the thing is, we don't wanna
give him a false sense of hope.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.255
You know, in case it turns out
that we can't help him.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
Why are you guys getting in the way?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.594
Why won't you help me?

16:08.677 --> 16:11.305
-Honey.
-Hilde, that's not what we're saying.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.040
Hey.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.833
You okay?

16:47.299 --> 16:50.302
I just-- I know I can solve this.

16:50.385 --> 16:54.139
I know I can help him,
but they just won't let me.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.059
Hey.

16:59.144 --> 17:03.023
You know, this, like, giant nerd
once told me

17:03.106 --> 17:06.734
that if I'm ever feeling scared, you know,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.530
if she feels like
she can't do anything...

17:10.864 --> 17:12.074
do you know what she does?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.992
I put my head down and work?

17:15.702 --> 17:16.912
Yeah.

17:18.247 --> 17:21.834
You love being a journalist
because no one gave it to you.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.630
So no one can take it away.
Not even Mom and Dad.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.384
You got this.

17:34.638 --> 17:35.806
Hey, Hilde?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.808
Hilde, can you come down here?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.412
What are you doing here?

17:59.246 --> 18:02.040
My dad's friend at the NTSB came through.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.544
She took a look at the black box
you sent me.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.007
Now, the original magnetic tape
in the flight recorder was damaged,

18:10.090 --> 18:14.970
but their lab was able to recover
a decent audio track from it.

18:15.929 --> 18:16.930
That's great.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.561
Isn't that great?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.981
Yeah, Hilde, what you found...

18:28.525 --> 18:29.985
that was Sam's dad's plane.

18:31.695 --> 18:35.073
I listened to the recording.
It's mostly static.

18:35.157 --> 18:38.035
Nothing too scary.
Some stuff I didn't understand.

18:38.118 --> 18:42.289
But there's something on it
that you all need to hear.

18:47.336 --> 18:50.214
Look, we just wanna make sure
that you're ready for this.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.049
Okay, first of all,
we don't know what's on there.

18:52.132 --> 18:56.220
And second of all, you know,
it could get pretty intense.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.305
Sam's my friend.

18:58.388 --> 19:02.392
And if there's something on there
that can help him, then I wanna hear it.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.186
Yeah, okay.

19:04.269 --> 19:07.356
Hey, it's great that you wanna
look out for your friend,

19:07.439 --> 19:09.608
but it's our job to look out for you.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.444
Right, right.
It gets too much, that's it.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.989
I'm pulling you outta there, right?
No negotiating. That is the plan, okay?

19:16.073 --> 19:17.282
'Kay.

19:17.366 --> 19:21.328
And remember, right,
the hardest stories to cover

19:21.411 --> 19:23.413
are the ones you care most about.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.541
All right?

19:27.209 --> 19:28.710
All right, you got it. Come on.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.337
Okay.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.508
Everyone ready?

19:46.228 --> 19:48.146
Descend to flight level 2500.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.234
-Who's that?
-Air traffic control.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.152
Looking good, Hank.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.946
Roger, tower. Descending 2-5.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.699
Tower to Mohawk eight-niner, go again.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.702
Confirm descend
to flight level 2500, over.

20:01.785 --> 20:06.623
Yeah, confirmed.
Heading 090-- Wait. Stand by.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.919
There it is. There it is.
That's gotta be it.

20:12.296 --> 20:13.630
What is he talking about?

20:14.673 --> 20:18.635
Stand by, tower. I'm turning around.
I need to get a closer look.

20:18.719 --> 20:19.970
Go again, Mohawk.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.514
Here we go.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.641
I can't believe it.

20:25.559 --> 20:26.894
Richie was right.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.228
Wait, what did he say?

20:28.312 --> 20:29.771
-Did he just say Richie?
-What...

20:29.855 --> 20:32.232
-Yeah.
-Wait, sorry--

20:32.316 --> 20:34.318
Hank Gillis knew Richie? What?

20:34.401 --> 20:37.154
I mean, a little.
We were all friends with Sam,

20:37.237 --> 20:39.781
but I have no idea why Hank
would mention Richie like that.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.492
Is it because he loved planes?

20:42.576 --> 20:45.287
I mean, we all loved planes.
We were kids.

20:50.209 --> 20:51.376
Stand by, tower.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.046
I'm getting my camera ready.
I need to get photos of this.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.964
Mohawk, pull up. You are too low.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.258
Just hold on. I have to get this photo.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.135
What was that?

21:00.219 --> 21:02.554
Something's wrong.
The engine's stalling.

21:02.638 --> 21:06.141
-Matt, we should stop this.
-Mom, I'm okay.

21:06.225 --> 21:07.684
It's not going, Art.

21:07.768 --> 21:09.853
The engine's starving for fuel.
There's no way.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.396
Mohawk, repeat.

21:11.480 --> 21:15.150
Tell my kids... I love them.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.263
Hey.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.438
Hey, how you doing? You okay?

21:55.774 --> 21:56.817
Yeah.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.663
What do you think Sam's dad
was looking for when his plane crashed?

22:10.455 --> 22:14.126
Yeah, I mean, can we get
location information from the black box?

22:14.209 --> 22:15.627
Well, I mean, I can't.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.755
Maybe someone more experienced
could listen to the audio

22:18.839 --> 22:21.675
along with a flight map
and do a lot of math.

22:22.217 --> 22:25.721
Yeah, but pilots need to file
a flight plan...

22:25.804 --> 22:26.805
Here we go.

22:26.889 --> 22:29.224
...and that could still be in the records
at the airport.

22:29.308 --> 22:32.102
There it is. There it is.
That's gotta be it.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.981
I'm getting my camera ready.
I need to get photos of this.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.567
He saw something. He wanted pictures.

22:41.028 --> 22:42.154
"Richie was right"?

22:42.237 --> 22:44.865
Richie must've told Sam's dad
to look for something.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.701
So what was he right about?

22:48.702 --> 22:50.996
And why was Sam's dad even talking to him?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.789
I mean, you guys were his best friends,

22:52.873 --> 22:55.250
and you didn't know
he was hanging out with some adult?

22:55.834 --> 22:56.835
That's weird.

22:56.919 --> 22:58.420
But you hang out with adults.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.464
I have sources. It's different.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.841
Source? I thought we were friends.

23:03.467 --> 23:04.468
I don't know.

23:05.052 --> 23:08.931
Yeah, well,
there was a lot to take in back then.

23:09.515 --> 23:12.184
You know, you didn't always notice
that stuff when you were a kid.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.894
Yeah, and he could be quiet.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.022
You know, introverted sometimes.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.526
Spoon gets like that sometimes.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.402
But don't people just...

23:23.737 --> 23:25.322
get like that sometimes?

23:27.741 --> 23:31.370
I mean, maybe it was.
Maybe it was a sign that something was up.

23:31.954 --> 23:34.414
I don't know, like,
Richie was always like that, right?

23:34.498 --> 23:36.625
He was always like that
even before everything happened.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.502
Yeah, that was just Richie. Wasn't it?

23:40.838 --> 23:43.215
If your friend hides
something like that from you...

23:44.758 --> 23:47.386
does that mean that
they don't wanna be your friend?

23:47.469 --> 23:50.931
No. No, no, no. Of course not. No.

23:51.014 --> 23:54.351
But sometimes, you know, that just means--

23:54.434 --> 23:56.645
-Sometimes it means--
-It means they're scared.

24:00.649 --> 24:04.152
And they don't wanna tell you something,
'cause they're afraid of what you'll say.

24:04.903 --> 24:07.990
Right. Right, yeah.
And it means you gotta help 'em.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.033
You know,
you gotta be there for 'em even more.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.249
I'm gonna try to find that flight plan.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.920
Yeah, I believe you will.

24:33.348 --> 24:34.433
Hey.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.143
Can I sit?

24:37.311 --> 24:39.438
Sure. I mean,
they don't take reservations here,

24:39.521 --> 24:40.939
so it's first come, first served.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.496
Are we good?
You just seem kinda mad at me.

24:56.997 --> 24:58.165
I'm not mad.

25:00.417 --> 25:01.418
Okay.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.715
I don't know, do you maybe
not like Ethan or something?

25:06.798 --> 25:11.094
'Cause you've just been acting weird
around me and, like, not talking to me.

25:12.346 --> 25:15.432
Like right now? Come on, as we're talking?

25:17.893 --> 25:20.187
Well, no, but, like, I just--

25:21.188 --> 25:23.857
I mean, like, I can't really tell
if we're friends or not.

25:24.441 --> 25:28.237
Dude, it's okay.
All right, we're fine. We're friends.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.245
Your boyfriend's looking for you.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.221
You guys have to stop doing that.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.974
You can talk to us. We're your friends.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.476
You haven't been
being yourself these days.

25:59.560 --> 26:03.105
I just-- I think it'd be better
if I tone it down a bit.

26:05.107 --> 26:10.195
Lately, I've been feeling that
maybe if I just stay below the radar...

26:10.279 --> 26:12.781
-But clothes are your thing.
-It's fine.

26:12.865 --> 26:15.450
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.331
Can I borrow your phone for a sec?

26:22.791 --> 26:23.792
Thanks.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.220
Hello, Miss Witherspoon.

26:35.304 --> 26:39.766
Could we swing by later,
when Spoon's not there?

26:47.900 --> 26:49.610
-I should've told you about the job.
-No.

26:49.693 --> 26:52.404
-No. I should've told you about the job.
-No. No, let me--

26:52.487 --> 26:54.281
No, I shouldn't have said
that thing about the ring.

26:54.364 --> 26:57.743
I am sorry. I didn't know how to tell you.
It wasn't even real.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.412
And then it just didn't seem
worth fighting about.

27:00.495 --> 27:02.372
Yeah, but then I made it a fight, so...

27:14.051 --> 27:15.135
I got scared.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.305
I don't want you to leave.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.350
I don't think I'm going to.

27:21.433 --> 27:24.353
It was too far.
I didn't love the district.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.438
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

27:29.191 --> 27:30.859
Did you really buy a ring?

27:36.406 --> 27:37.407
Okay.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.327
You been carrying it around
this whole time?

27:40.410 --> 27:42.913
I thought that was just, like,
a figure of speech or something.

27:42.996 --> 27:46.208
You know I'm not good at hiding stuff.
You would've found it in, like, a second.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.292
Here, it's...

27:50.254 --> 27:52.381
Oh, Frank. That's beautiful.

27:52.464 --> 27:53.715
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:53.799 --> 27:55.676
Well, does it fit on even...

27:57.761 --> 27:59.388
Do you still wanna marry me?

28:01.014 --> 28:02.516
'Cause I really wanna marry you.

28:07.354 --> 28:10.816
-Frank Briggs, would you do me the honor--
-No, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.526
No. Hey. Give me that.

28:12.609 --> 28:13.819
It's my line.

28:32.629 --> 28:33.630
Kim.

28:37.384 --> 28:38.385
Kimberly.

28:39.678 --> 28:41.889
-Will you--
-Yes. Yes.

28:42.556 --> 28:45.100
-Yes.
-Did you just say yes?

28:47.352 --> 28:49.938
All right, all right. Congratulations.

28:50.022 --> 28:51.857
Oh, great, great,
the whole peanut gallery.

28:51.940 --> 28:55.027
It's my worst nightmare.
Will you get back to work?

28:55.694 --> 28:56.695
Aw, Frank.

29:01.491 --> 29:02.492
You did it.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.723
Why you guys dressed like that?

30:07.850 --> 30:08.851
We missed you.

30:08.934 --> 30:12.855
Well, unfortunately, everything
you're wearing is tragically outdated.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.648
But you're pulling it off.

30:36.587 --> 30:38.338
Okay, guys. This is the place.

30:38.422 --> 30:41.175
We've gotta find information
about Sam's dad's plane.

30:43.135 --> 30:44.344
Hi.

30:44.428 --> 30:49.349
We're doing a school project
about aerodynamics and, like, math.

30:53.729 --> 30:56.773
Oh, that's not related to the project.
That's just how we dress.

30:56.857 --> 30:58.525
Could we take a look at your archives?

30:59.776 --> 31:00.861
Be my guest.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.365
-Hey, Frank.
-Hey.

31:05.949 --> 31:09.411
Yeah, what's going on?
What's the exciting update?

31:09.494 --> 31:10.954
Are we ready to take her out?

31:12.581 --> 31:14.833
She is up and running again.

31:14.917 --> 31:16.001
-Really?
-Come on.

31:16.084 --> 31:19.087
Damn. Wow, you're a genius.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.172
Yeah.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.592
Totally am. Your words.

31:26.386 --> 31:27.888
What's going on?

31:28.805 --> 31:32.601
Well, you just-- you seem happy.
You're never this happy.

31:33.477 --> 31:35.312
Well, actually, I...

31:37.898 --> 31:39.316
I asked Kim to marry me.

31:41.026 --> 31:43.529
-What?
-I don't know why, but she said yes.

31:44.196 --> 31:46.573
Come on, man. That's huge.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.826
Yeah, really. Congratulations, Frank.
Really. Congrats.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.829
-Wow, that's...
-Yeah.

31:52.913 --> 31:54.790
-We should make a toast, right?
-Yeah.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.084
Yeah, let's get some booze.
I bet we got some back here.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.628
Oh, you know what?
The cabinet, our old stash.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.053
Half of these aren't flight plans.

32:09.638 --> 32:11.515
Gas receipts, maps.

32:12.766 --> 32:15.310
Digitization, people. Get with the times.

32:15.853 --> 32:19.064
At least they're organized by decade.
Sort of.

32:19.147 --> 32:21.275
-This is gonna take us all night.
-Wait.

32:22.067 --> 32:25.863
This one says October... 1987.

32:25.946 --> 32:27.406
This one too.

32:28.532 --> 32:31.618
Guys, this is it.
This is Sam's dad's plane.

32:36.665 --> 32:37.749
It's the wrong date.

32:38.417 --> 32:42.546
The day of the crash was October 24th.
This says September 28th.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.592
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

32:52.556 --> 32:53.557
That's weird.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.478
-He made the same flight three times.
-What do you mean?

32:59.062 --> 33:01.857
It shows all his intended flight path
in all of these.

33:02.357 --> 33:03.942
My grandpa said you have to file it

33:04.026 --> 33:07.196
so air traffic control knows
who's in the sky at any given time.

33:07.279 --> 33:11.658
On September 28th,
October 5th and October 12th,

33:11.742 --> 33:14.870
Hank Gillis made the same flight path
up the Saratoga Mountains.

33:14.953 --> 33:16.538
That must be where he crashed.

33:17.664 --> 33:20.709
On the black box,
he said he was taking pictures.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.882
So he knew what he was looking for
because he'd already been there.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.009
So what was he looking at?

33:31.512 --> 33:34.139
The flight plan from the crash is missing.

33:34.223 --> 33:36.266
There'll be another copy on the plane.

33:38.352 --> 33:40.062
We've gotta get back in that basement.

33:40.145 --> 33:42.523
We? I've got a stain on my clothes
from the dumbwaiter...

33:42.606 --> 33:44.858
And it's too dangerous
with that strange guy walking around.

33:44.942 --> 33:47.444
-And that hurts me, Hilde, deeply.
-We still don't know who he is.

33:49.238 --> 33:52.032
-Are you out of your mind?
-Trip, just wait till you see it.

33:52.115 --> 33:55.744
They're hiding a whole plane crash
down in the basement.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.705
Now what were you doing in the basement?

33:58.789 --> 34:00.499
Wait, it's a party, all right?

34:00.582 --> 34:03.669
There's no law that says a journalist
can't investigate a public event.

34:04.169 --> 34:06.421
Come on, Trip. Will you help us out?

34:07.464 --> 34:08.966
Don't mind me. I'm just observing.

34:09.675 --> 34:13.344
I do love the first name basis,
small town community thing going on here.

34:15.222 --> 34:20.018
Look, we have reason to believe that
that is Hank Gillis's plane. Yeah.

34:20.811 --> 34:22.145
Yeah, and if it is, well...

34:23.605 --> 34:25.107
well, you know how serious that is.

34:25.774 --> 34:29.194
Yes, that sounds like a great use
of the sheriff's time.

34:29.695 --> 34:33.407
I'm sure it's not a wild-goose chase.
We should check it out.

34:37.744 --> 34:41.373
Hilde, are you sure that's what you saw?

34:43.292 --> 34:44.293
I'm sure.

35:18.785 --> 35:21.079
Dad, it was right here. I--

35:21.705 --> 35:23.540
This can't be the same room.

35:29.338 --> 35:32.466
Dad, it's him. It's the guy.

35:33.550 --> 35:35.719
I hear there's an emergency
in our archive storage

35:35.802 --> 35:37.513
that requires immediate police attention.

35:37.596 --> 35:39.264
And you are...

35:39.348 --> 35:42.142
Karl Kurz.
I'm head of security for this property.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.561
What did you do with the plane?
It was right here.

35:44.645 --> 35:45.854
We even got the black--

35:47.147 --> 35:48.690
Sheriff, with all due respect,

35:48.774 --> 35:50.901
I don't know what this young lady
is talking about.

35:52.569 --> 35:55.447
Is there anything you need to see?
Anything I could show you?

35:55.531 --> 35:57.908
No, sir, Mr. Kurz.
I'm sorry to bother you.

36:02.162 --> 36:04.498
When you're done,
let's have a word outside.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.131
Trip, wait. I--

36:13.215 --> 36:14.216
No.

36:14.967 --> 36:17.636
Enough. I'm done here.

36:17.719 --> 36:21.765
Everybody says to stay away from you all,
that you're trouble.

36:24.309 --> 36:26.520
I'm the one dumb enough not to listen.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.864
Yeah, let me talk to her, all right.
I'll figure it out.

36:46.415 --> 36:47.499
I know you have it.

36:48.292 --> 36:50.544
-Have what?
-My backpack.

37:07.644 --> 37:08.645
Oh, hey.

37:10.022 --> 37:11.148
Hey, what's going on?

37:12.107 --> 37:13.358
You guys okay?

37:15.819 --> 37:17.696
I'm gonna go check on Pop-Pop.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.323
Right, good idea. Thanks, Scout.

37:24.244 --> 37:25.287
What happened?

37:25.370 --> 37:28.415
Yeah-- No. No, no. Of course.

37:29.458 --> 37:33.337
Ethan is welcome to stay here
for the night if you need him to.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.797
My mom and dad
are hashing out custody.

37:36.423 --> 37:39.259
Or they're getting back together again.
I don't know.

37:39.968 --> 37:42.638
All I know is that it's always,
always a fight with them

37:42.721 --> 37:45.182
and being in the same house
with them right now is just--

37:45.265 --> 37:47.601
Especially when you're trying
to get caught up on schoolwork.

37:47.684 --> 37:50.354
-Yeah, it's impossible.
-I'm glad you came.

37:52.731 --> 37:53.815
Hey.

37:53.899 --> 37:57.611
So I told your mom
you could stay here tonight.

37:57.694 --> 38:00.072
In a separate room, of course.

38:00.822 --> 38:01.823
Right.

38:01.907 --> 38:04.868
Great.
Yeah, yeah, you know, marriage, it's--

38:04.952 --> 38:06.537
Well, it's really hard.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.789
I'm sure your parents
are doing the best they can.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.125
Well, the best they can seems to

38:12.751 --> 38:15.170
require a lot of yelling
at each other, so...

38:16.505 --> 38:17.798
Well, thank you for having me.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.800
-Really.
-Yeah.

38:19.883 --> 38:21.969
Yeah, of course. Of course.

38:22.052 --> 38:25.097
You know, just one night.

38:25.931 --> 38:29.393
-Right.
-Yeah, and you sleep down here.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.561
Right.

38:31.103 --> 38:34.314
Yeah, and those stairs,
they're, you know, pretty creaky,

38:34.398 --> 38:35.566
-so...
-Dad.

38:36.483 --> 38:37.568
You know what I'm saying, right?

38:37.651 --> 38:40.362
-Right. Yeah.
-Yeah. Right, you get it.

38:40.445 --> 38:43.031
Yeah. Well, thank you, Mr. Lisko.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.581
Are we going on vacation?

38:51.623 --> 38:52.875
No, Pop-Pop.

38:53.542 --> 38:56.211
Sam's dad flew his plane
and I don't know where.

38:59.089 --> 39:02.009
What did he go back to look at
and take pictures of?

39:04.303 --> 39:06.346
What did he see before the crash?

39:12.144 --> 39:13.478
Hey, Scout.

39:13.562 --> 39:16.398
I just-- Yeah, I just wanted to see
if you wanted to talk.

39:17.649 --> 39:18.817
About what?

39:18.901 --> 39:21.653
Well, you know,
about what happened with Trip

39:21.737 --> 39:24.072
and... what she said to you.

39:25.490 --> 39:26.491
That.

39:28.243 --> 39:31.121
Yeah. Yeah, that.

39:32.164 --> 39:34.166
No, that was tough, huh?

39:34.791 --> 39:36.710
No, I just wanna make sure you're okay.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.587
I'm fine, I--

39:39.213 --> 39:40.797
She's just a source.

39:44.343 --> 39:46.386
I gotta focus on this now anyway.

39:47.638 --> 39:50.891
Okay. I just, you know,
I just wanted to see if you're--

39:50.974 --> 39:52.100
The coordinates.

39:52.935 --> 39:54.811
These are waypoints.

39:54.895 --> 39:57.356
They're written in longitude and latitude,

39:57.439 --> 40:02.110
and they show where the plane went
on its flight. Here. Watch.

40:02.903 --> 40:06.323
He took off from here.
And then, what's the first coordinate?

40:07.533 --> 40:10.536
48 degrees, 11 minutes

40:10.619 --> 40:15.207
and 27.1 seconds north.

40:15.290 --> 40:18.544
Okay. And what's the other one?

40:18.627 --> 40:21.505
-122 degrees...
-All right.

40:21.588 --> 40:26.218
...37 minutes and 36.5 seconds west.

40:26.301 --> 40:29.930
-Uh-huh. He took off from here...
-Mm-hmm.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.516
...and he was traveling in this direction.

40:33.433 --> 40:34.726
Okay.

40:34.810 --> 40:36.478
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

40:40.566 --> 40:42.276
-Uh-huh.
-And that's--

40:42.818 --> 40:43.819
But--

40:44.862 --> 40:48.198
That must've been the last place he went
before turning back.

40:49.157 --> 40:53.078
-That must've been where he saw something.
-The plane must be here.

40:57.791 --> 40:59.668
But there's nothing there, Pop-Pop.

41:00.878 --> 41:02.254
Wait. What's that?

41:03.297 --> 41:04.506
Looks like an island.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.387
That must've been where he was going.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.139
Yeah, but what did he see?

41:13.473 --> 41:16.101
I mean, what could possibly be out there?

41:18.770 --> 41:20.230
That's what we gotta find out.
