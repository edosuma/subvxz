00:02.335 --> 00:05.213
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>My keys-- Clare,</i>
<i>have you seen my keys?</i>

00:05.296 --> 00:06.756
{\an3}Uh, yeah,
they're by the phone.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.551
Oh, thank you.

00:10.802 --> 00:11.928
Oh, God, I am so late.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.097
I'm supposed to meet
my dad for breakfast.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.265
When was the last
time you saw Kel?

00:16.349 --> 00:18.601
I don't remember.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.437
Actually, I don't think
I've seen her

00:20.520 --> 00:22.605
more than a couple of times
in the last two weeks.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.108
Yeah, I know. I called her
at Colin's like five times--

00:25.191 --> 00:26.109
they're not answering.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.736
{\an3}(sighs)

00:27.819 --> 00:29.612
I'm worried about her.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.780
Yeah, I know.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.698
It's not like her.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.952
What, you think Colin's
still getting high?

00:36.035 --> 00:38.455
Yeah, I do.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.623
And I think he's dragging
her down with him.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.959
No way.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.461
Not Kel.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.546
She would never touch
that stuff.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.519
Are you going to class?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.688
Uh-uh, I can't move.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.446
Sure you can.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.531
{\an1}(chuckles)

01:13.615 --> 01:15.658
Mm.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.828
{\an1}Just don't make me
go to school today, okay?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.122
Wouldn't think of it.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.217

01:58.701 --> 02:00.829

Slow down, Keats.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.311
{\an1}What were you restless
in the womb?

03:06.394 --> 03:07.812
{\an3}Well, I was born
two months premature.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.440
{\an1}Yeah, well, do we have to get
in shape all in one day?

03:10.523 --> 03:12.483
{\an5}Look, if you even
want to finish the
Rock the Vote 10K,

03:12.567 --> 03:15.069
{\an1}you're gonna have
to put in the miles.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.073
{\an3}Susan, we have
two months.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.951
{\an1}Yeah, and you've only
jogged one block.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.078
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.958
(garbled radio transmission)

03:29.042 --> 03:30.501
What happened?

03:30.585 --> 03:32.795
{\an6}She lost control
of her car and
jumped the curb.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.255
I saw the whole thing.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.760
BRANDON:
Man, that looks bad.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.810
Are you okay?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.312
I-I don't know.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.153
Wait, uh, my shoelace.

03:57.236 --> 03:58.988
{\an3}Hold on one sec,
my shoelace is untied.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.157
Yeah, right. What's next,
a broken fingernail?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.951
I'm serious, hold on.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.161
You are a lollygagger.
Now come on, suck it up!

04:05.244 --> 04:07.538
(tires squealing
and horn honking)

04:07.622 --> 04:09.832
(thudding)

04:09.916 --> 04:12.251
No!

04:14.420 --> 04:18.048
Susan? Susan?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.802
{\an6}MAN:
People, can you just go
about your own business?

04:20.885 --> 04:22.845
We have everything
under control.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.973
Just get me out
of here, please.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.933
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.311
{\an3}Come on, why don't we
sit down right here, huh?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.358
What's the matter?

04:38.903 --> 04:44.033
My, um... older sister was
killed in a car accident.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.952
Hit-and-run.

04:50.289 --> 04:52.542
{\an3}I didn't know
you had a sister.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.168
Yeah.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.714
She was only 22.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.550
{\an1}She, uh... she just
finished Stanford

05:00.633 --> 05:03.553
and was on her way
to Harvard Medical School.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.221
What was her name?

05:05.304 --> 05:06.973
Kathryn.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.561
You know, I really loved her,
but everybody did.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.062
She was the best.

05:14.313 --> 05:17.775
You know, I always thought
if I could be half as good

05:17.859 --> 05:20.194
as she was or half as smart.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.864
Hey, you're doing pretty well.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.575
I think she'd be very proud.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.287
I hope so, 'cause, you know,

05:29.370 --> 05:31.998
everything I'm doing
is because of her--

05:32.081 --> 05:34.542
school, the paper, everything.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.919
(siren wailing)

05:42.050 --> 05:45.053
NAT:
Hey, hey, you got new wheels.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.971
{\an3}Yeah. My dad got
it for me.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.514
Gift for good grades.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.058
Wow, it's goThanks.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.851
Gorgeous?

05:51.934 --> 05:52.935
I'd say it's cute.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.437
{\an3}Very cute.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.105
I prefer sporty, actually.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.817
Okay, cute
and sporty.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.444
{\an1}Kind of like
a Barbie-mobile.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.987
Barbie drove a pink
Corvette, Steve.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.781
{\an3}I always knew that
girl had class.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.948
Well, it was a Corvette.

06:06.032 --> 06:06.657
CLARE:
Yeah, well, I bet

06:06.741 --> 06:08.618
she never made the Dean's list.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.994
Clare, you made Dean's List
again?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.163
I did. Even you couldn't
drag me down, Steve.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.123
{\an3}Well, congratulations.
And drive in good health.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.583
I'm goinThank you.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.502
{\an3}So you want to take
it for a drive?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.170
Uh, not really.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.963
I hear these cars are pigs.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.633
{\an3}You know, all styling,
no performance.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.885
Don't diss my car.
It's very peppy.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.095
Yeah, for a chick's car.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.598
But next to my Corvette, it
kind of stands still, Clare.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.808
Really?

06:31.891 --> 06:34.477
Well, I'll tell you what,
Parnelli,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.062
I'll race my
Barbie-mobile

06:36.145 --> 06:37.980
against you any time
you'd like, okay?

06:38.064 --> 06:41.025
Please, don't make
me laugh, Clare.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.075
(siren wailing)

07:08.261 --> 07:10.972
{\an1}Is there a problem,
Officer?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.181
{\an3}License and
registration, please.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.349
{\an3}You, too.

07:13.432 --> 07:14.475
I know how this looks,

07:14.559 --> 07:16.686
but this is a real emergency.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.854
I'm an organ donor recipient.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.481
{\an1}My beeper just
Steve....

07:20.565 --> 07:23.484
I'm late for dialysis, okay?

07:23.568 --> 07:26.487
{\an3}Not okay. I'm citing
you for speeding.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.364
Um, Officer, sorry
to bother you,

07:28.447 --> 07:30.825
{\an1}I know you're busy,
but when you pulled us over,

07:30.908 --> 07:32.869
which one of us was ahead?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.914
Uh...

07:40.084 --> 07:41.294
...you were, Miss.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.962
Thanks.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.632
(growls)

07:49.385 --> 07:51.053
{\an1}You know what
Hmm?s thinking?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.014
{\an1}We should go
shopping today.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.223
For what?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.558
For presents.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.269
For you, for me,
for me, for you.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.021
Well, my dad did say

08:00.104 --> 08:02.732
{\an3}that I should buy myself
something nice.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.275
We could spend it
all in one place.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.527
All right, a goal.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.904
You want to really have fun?

08:07.987 --> 08:09.530
{\an1}Let's get a limo to
take us around all day.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.782
{\an3}Mmm. Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea,

08:11.866 --> 08:14.869
{\an3}because neither one
of us are exactly

08:14.952 --> 08:17.538
{\an3}designated driver
material today, are we?

08:17.622 --> 08:18.873
(both laughing)

08:18.956 --> 08:21.918
And we can make love
in between purchases.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.045
{\an1}Hmm, what do you like better--
making love or shopping?

08:24.128 --> 08:24.795
It's a toss-up.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.964
I'll get back to you.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.052
(knock at door)

08:31.135 --> 08:32.303
(chuckles)

08:32.385 --> 08:34.054
I'll get that.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.140
Oh, yeah.to clean this up?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.816
VaHey.e?

08:45.900 --> 08:47.944
{\an3}What are you
May I come in?

08:48.027 --> 08:48.986
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.489
Um, I've got some great news.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.615
{\an1}Hey, Kel.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.492
Long time no school.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.786
It's nice to know
I've been missed.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.957
I think you'll want
to take a look at this.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.125
{\an4}It's from Sterling Penn,
he's a collector.
He lives in Hawaii.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.794
{\an1}He's got one
of the most famous

09:04.877 --> 09:06.504
{\an1}contemporary art
collections in the world.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.964
Yeah, I know who he is.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.092
{\an3}He read about my mural
in the <i> L.A. Times,</i> Kelly.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.802
He wants to see more.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.804
{\an1}He's flying
That's great.

09:14.887 --> 09:15.972
Yeah, that's,
that's really great.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.394
Having fun?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.815
Colin,

09:25.898 --> 09:28.651
what is this?

09:28.734 --> 09:32.822
{\an3}Oh, must be left over
from the holidays.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.532
Yeah, must be.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.327
Well, have a nice day.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.788
Yeah, you, too.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.165
Bye-bye.
Thanks for coming.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.838
Think she bought it?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.464
Ask me if I care.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.507
Do you care?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.510
(laughing):
No.

09:54.593 --> 09:57.179
DONNA:
<i>I just don't understand how you</i>

09:57.263 --> 09:59.849
and Joe's other doctor can
see things so differently?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.518
{\an1}Honey, it's
very subjective.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.145
Medicine is like
detective work.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.981
{\an1}You look for clues, then you
try to find the culprit.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.858
It's not an exact science.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.735
{\an1}And I have to admit
what I saw

10:10.818 --> 10:12.695
{\an1}when I looked at Joe's EKG
was very subtle.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.989
Sam Levin saw something else.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.992
No, thanks, Nat.in?

10:18.075 --> 10:19.744
The check, please.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.039
{\an3}Well, in the meantime,
what's the patient

10:23.122 --> 10:24.373
supposed to do?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.833
Normally, go

10:25.916 --> 10:30.046
for a third opinion
or err on the side of caution.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.673
Joe's not doing that.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.008
I know, but give him time.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.510
It is not easy to be in
Joe's shoes right now.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.055
I know, that Daddy.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.349
But I'm worried about him.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.851
I'm scared.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.978
I understand.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.356
Look, I've got to get over
to the hospital right now.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.983
{\an1}But I want you
to call me, all right?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.443
I really want to talk
about this tonight.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.195
Okay.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.365
Good.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.575
{\an1}Hey, Dr. Martin,
how are you?.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.869
Good. Good. Good,ing?

11:01.952 --> 11:04.789
I'm all right.w are you?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.540
Uh, get me some orange juice.
I'll be right back.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.583
{\an1}Donna?

11:07.666 --> 11:08.626
{\an3}Yeah.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.627
You all right?

11:09.710 --> 11:10.961
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.421
What's going on?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.924
{\an3}Look, I'm, I'm just worried
about Joe, Brandon.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.051
My dad thinks there's something
wrong with his heart.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.845
What do you mean there's
I don't know.ng with his heart.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.598
{\an3}And the trouble is,
Joe got a second opinion

11:22.681 --> 11:24.600
{\an3}from a heart doctor
the team sent him to.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.060
The guy says he's fine.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.104
Well, that's a good
thing, right?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.107
Yeah, if the guy's right.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.943
Look, I gotta go.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.820
{\an1}Yeah, listen, uh, if
there's anything I can do,

11:35.903 --> 11:36.779
I'll be around.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.781
Thank you.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.793
Now, Silver, I know you know

11:50.876 --> 11:52.795
a certain ticket-fixer
by the name of Eddie.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.797
{\an1}All I want is an introduction.
That's all, okay?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.966
{\an1}I can't afford my
insurance rates going up.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.008
Steve, I told you.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.009
{\an3}I'd give you
Eddie's number,

11:59.093 --> 12:00.219
{\an3}but he just
got busted.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.804
{\an3}I'm Great.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.180
Why don't you just go
to traffic school?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.181
It's no big deal.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.474
No luck.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.184
Silver's guy is out of business.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.978
Okay. So what's it going to be?

12:09.061 --> 12:11.981
We have traffic school
for Armenians,

12:12.064 --> 12:13.941
pizza lovers,
chocoholics.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.151
{\an3}Oh, here's
a good one.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.277
Gourmet traffic school.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.072
Ooh! We could watch gory movies
of traffic accidents

12:20.156 --> 12:21.657
while we sauté
porcini mushrooms.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.451
How appetizing.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.453
Works for me. What do you think?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.454
I think we wouldn't
be in this mess

12:26.537 --> 12:27.830
if it hadn't been for you.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.998
Oh, don't blame me.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.958
You just couldn't
bear the thought

12:31.041 --> 12:33.002
that I might have beaten you.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.670
(laughs)
You didn't.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.338
Well, that's not
what the cop said.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.007
{\an3}He said I was
winning. Remember?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.675
Wait. You asked the cop?

12:43.095 --> 12:46.015
You two are in a class
by yourselves.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.224
Enjoy traffic school.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.733
COLIN:
<i>Now, this is the way to shop.</i>

12:55.816 --> 12:56.901
You are a showoff.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.819
{\an3}Oh, come on.
Don't you love it?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.529
I mean, growing
up in Rochester,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.364
{\an3}practically the only
time you'd see a limousine

13:02.448 --> 13:04.241
was when somebody died.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.202
{\an1}You're kidding me,
aren't you?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.119
No. Not really.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.038
{\an3}I mean, the first time
I was ever in a limo

13:09.121 --> 13:11.874
was my... my high school prom.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.044
{\an6}My date practically
threw up out
the moon roof.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.546
That's very memorable.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.048
Yeah. That was
the good part.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.549
In the morning,
when I crawled home,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.676
there was this van
outside my house

13:22.760 --> 13:24.386
from the VA hospital.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.555
That's when I realized
it was him.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.723
Who?

13:27.806 --> 13:30.851
My father.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.228
My real father.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.021
You never told me about him.

13:34.104 --> 13:38.025
Yeah. It's not a great
conversation starter.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.027
Well, what's he like?

13:40.110 --> 13:42.071
He's blind.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.240
He lost his sight in Vietnam.

13:44.323 --> 13:48.953
{\an6}Funny thing is,
he's a better artist
than I'll ever be.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.038
How's that
for poetic injustice?

13:51.121 --> 13:53.707
Why didn't you ever tell me
about him?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.292
I don't know.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.835
Never came up.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.380
{\an3}Who knows? You might
meet him someday.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.631
Hopefully, not.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.800
He's a pretty scary guy.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.430
So, how about you?

14:08.514 --> 14:11.058
{\an3}When was your first
time in a limo?

14:11.141 --> 14:14.311
{\an1}Oh, well, I was
practically born in one.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.105
{\an1}I was brought home
from the hospital in one.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.107
{\an1}I went to my first day
of school

14:18.190 --> 14:19.775
in one.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.318
Whenever my dad was in L.A.,

14:21.402 --> 14:24.446
he had a stretch
and a driver on payroll.

14:27.241 --> 14:31.662
But there's one thing
I've never done in a limo.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.831
No way. You're lying.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.332
You are lying.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.459
{\an1}Uh-uh.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.839
Well, there's a first
time for everything?

14:41.922 --> 14:42.965
Oh...

15:05.571 --> 15:07.990
So what traffic school did
you guys finally decide on?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.700
{\an1}Gourmet.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.201
Comedy-gourmet
traffic school.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.328
Very interesting.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.329
Knock-knock!

15:13.412 --> 15:14.663
COLIN:
Hi,Hi.ys.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.706
Don't get up.

15:15.789 --> 15:16.999
What's this?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.626
{\an1}Open it and find out--
Here you go.ost

15:18.709 --> 15:20.836
Incredible it was.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.338
Oh, thank you.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.131
My dad gave me a little
belated Christmas cash

15:24.214 --> 15:25.215
and told me to spend it
any way I wanted,

15:25.299 --> 15:27.134
and I couldn't think
of any better way to spend it

15:27.217 --> 15:29.136
than on all of you,
'cause we just love you.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.138
{\an4}COLIN:
That we do, but you know what?
We're out of here.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.015
{\an1}Yeah. Colin's
taking me to Eclipse.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.017
Ooh!<i> Tres chic.</i>

15:35.100 --> 15:36.393
Yeah. Give those
to the others, would ya?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.729
Okay. See you.
Bye. Love you. Bye!

15:38.812 --> 15:40.981
{\an1}Bye!

15:41.065 --> 15:43.025
{\an1}(laughs)

15:43.108 --> 15:45.152
Well, that was strange.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.820
Well, rumor has it
the Three Wise Men

15:46.904 --> 15:49.239
{\an3}didn't show up in
Bethlehem till January.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.868
{\an3}Oh, man!
Internet In a Box!

15:52.951 --> 15:54.203
{\an3}I've been saving
up for this.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.163
Whoa. Whoa. Check it out.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.749
How classy.
For the driving enthusiast.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.834
Likewise. Even matches my car.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.336
What did you get, Val?

16:02.419 --> 16:04.004
{\an1}"Mirror, mirror,
on the wall."

16:04.088 --> 16:07.549
Aren't any of you the least bit
disturbed by any of this?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
{\an3}I mean, didn't you get
a good look at them?

16:09.259 --> 16:10.177
Kelly and Colin?

16:10.260 --> 16:11.512
{\an1}No. The ghosts
from Christmas Past.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.930
Yes, Colin and Kelly.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.223
I mean, you don't think
this is manic behavior?

16:14.306 --> 16:15.224
{\an3}You heard
what she said.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.725
{\an3}Her father gave her
some extra cash to blow.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.851
She's having
a good time.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.019
What's the big deal?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.062
{\an1}I don't know
about you people,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.272
but I feel loved.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.232
(laughter all around)

16:23.315 --> 16:25.943
Well, they were blowing
much more than cash.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.027
What? You think Colin
was high again?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.112
They both were.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.446
{\an1}STEVE:
Kelly high?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.323
No way. think so.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.117
She's been all over Colin
from the beginning about this.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.743
{\an3}That is kind
of a far stretch.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.744
I don't think she'd be using

16:35.828 --> 16:37.037
after what she went through
with her mother.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.414
{\an1}Yeah. And that
whole intervention

16:38.497 --> 16:39.915
thing with Dylan.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.417
Oh, guys, please. Come on!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.835
I mean, all I keep hearing about

16:42.918 --> 16:44.253
is Dylan
and Kelly's mother and David.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.462
I mean, when does

16:45.546 --> 16:47.131
{\an3}anybody learn anything
from the lessons

16:47.214 --> 16:48.799
{\an3}of the past?
I mean, trust me.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.134
These are guilt gifts.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.136
Kelly's getting high.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.939
{\an1}Hi. Don't you
love this place?

17:04.021 --> 17:06.066
{\an1}I brought my parents
here last week.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.779
For madame, the risotto
with black truffles.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.740
{\an1}Thank you.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.782
And, monsieur, our roasted rack
of lamb with Tuscan beans.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.410
Thanks.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.121
I only order this

17:19.204 --> 17:20.289
{\an3}'cause I like
the little booties.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.624
Will there be anything else?

17:22.708 --> 17:24.084
No, no. We're
fine. Thanks.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.298
I don't even know
how you can eat meat.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.133
{\an3}Easy. With a knife
and fork.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.301
Baah!

17:32.384 --> 17:34.136
Baah! Baah!

17:34.219 --> 17:36.847
{\an3}Stop it.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.058
Go ahead. Try your risotto.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.936
I'm not really that hungry.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.938
Yeah. Me neither.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.107
Okay. My turn.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.484
{\an3}Where's our
little power pack?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.319
It's gone.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.737
I did it.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.989
Gone? Come on.
You got to be kidding me.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.282
{\an3}Kelly, there
was enough

17:55.365 --> 17:56.992
left for both of us.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.495
Look, you've been going through
it twice as fast as I have.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.996
You're crazy.

18:01.079 --> 18:01.830
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.499
Why don't we just
go get some more?

18:03.582 --> 18:04.666
We can't. Not from Paul.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.834
He's... he's all tapped out.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.504
{\an3}Come on.
Let's split.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.507
I don't want to sit here
jonesing all night.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.092
I'm certainly not going to eat.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.016
(knocking on door)

18:21.099 --> 18:22.684
It's not locked.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.230
Hey, Brandon.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.189
Hey, Joe.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.565
{\an3}You're on
campus late.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.359
Well, the news never sleeps.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.069
{\an6}Besides, I was
kind of hoping
I'd find you here.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.987
Oh, yeah? What's going on?

18:34.071 --> 18:36.657
{\an5}Well, we got this
press release at
the paper today.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.159
{\an5}I just kind of
wanted to follow up
with you on it.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.994
{\an1}What press release
is that?

18:41.078 --> 18:42.663
{\an3}You're quoted.
You should know.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.082
Right. The ankle thing.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.167
Well, good news. I'm fine.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.837
Great. Everything else okay?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.005
{\an3}Knee? Back? Neck?
Thyroid gland?

18:52.089 --> 18:54.174
What is this?
A fishing expedition?

18:54.258 --> 19:00.138
Actually, let me take myself
off the record here, Joe.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.350
Donna told me that you went
to see her father,

19:03.433 --> 19:05.644
{\an3}and you may have some
kind of heart condition.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.524
{\an1}She had no business
telling you that.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.026
{\an1}She only said anything
because she cares.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.737
{\an6}Come on, Brandon,
you know how
doctors work.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.406
{\an3}One tells you one thing,
one tells you another.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.116
I'm fine.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.242
You sure?

19:20.325 --> 19:24.121
Let me tell you something.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.248
When I was 16,
I had a really bad accident.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.791
I was rock climbing.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.919
Fell off a cliff
nearly 100 feet.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.212
Check out these scars.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.134
{\an3}Doctor said I'd
never walk again.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.094
But I did, and here I am,

19:39.177 --> 19:41.305
California University's
starting quarterback,

19:41.388 --> 19:44.766
and I'm taking the Condors
to the Rose Bowl next year.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.268
Every day of my life,

19:46.351 --> 19:49.021
I have dreamed
of playing in the pros.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.939
And if I had listened
to those doctors,

19:51.023 --> 19:52.733
I'd still be stuck
in that wheelchair.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.403
Yeah. I understand.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.406
I wish you could get Donna
to understand.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.575
I'll see what I can do.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.038
Oh, hey, Brandon.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.498
Is this going to be in
the newspaper tomorrow?

20:08.582 --> 20:12.127
No. Like I said,
this was off the record.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.129
Thanks, man.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.839
You got it.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.489
I hear there's stuff
coming through here.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.991
Can you help me out?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.910
What kind of stuff?

20:44.993 --> 20:46.411
Like a blizzard.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.084
Follow me.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.137
You a cop?

21:04.221 --> 21:05.430
{\an1}No, man.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.641
{\an3}That's funny.
I think I smell ham.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.810
You're smelling 60 bucks

21:09.893 --> 21:12.229
{\an3}if you get
me what I need.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.981
{\an1}You stay right here.
Don't move.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.150
I mean, don't move
until I come back.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.070
{\an3}I'm not
going anywhere.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.585
I got nothing.ge?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.423
(siren wailing in distance)

21:44.261 --> 21:45.929
I got what you wanted.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.265
{\an1}Oh, man,
took you long enough.

21:54.896 --> 21:55.772
Thanks.

21:55.856 --> 21:56.982
Watch your back.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.401
This is a lousy neighborhood.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.082
Did you get it?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.251
YGive me some..

22:16.334 --> 22:17.961
{\an3}No, let's wait till
we get home, all right?

22:18.045 --> 22:20.422
{\an3}This whole scene
gives me theCome on.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.798
Have some scotch.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.800
Just have a drink.h.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.053
{\an5}It'll make you
feel better, take
the edge oNo.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.763
{\an3}Driver, back to Venice,
Main Street.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.140
{\an5}(whispering):
Let's just get
out of here.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.902
What?
(clears throat)

22:41.985 --> 22:45.614
{\an1}Nothing. I'm just really
not in the mood, that's all.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.948
Okay.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.117
Is something wrong?

22:49.201 --> 22:52.788
{\an1}Would it fall
on deaf ears if it were?

22:52.871 --> 22:55.499
Uh, no.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.793
Could've fooled me.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.294
{\an3}(chuckles)

22:59.377 --> 23:01.588
All right, I'm lost.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.468
(sighs)
No, David, you're blind.

23:06.551 --> 23:09.012
{\an1}And I can't
figure out why.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.472
You've been down
this road before.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.974
You know the signs of drug use
better than anyone.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.935
Think about it.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.603
When was the last time
you saw Kelly

23:16.686 --> 23:18.605
before she waltzed in here
acting like Santa Claus?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.985
{\an1}And when was
the last timele.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.153
you saw Kelly come in here

23:25.237 --> 23:27.614
and shower <i> me</i> with gifts
of love and affection?

23:27.697 --> 23:29.991
Face it, David,

23:30.075 --> 23:31.660
she was high.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.579
So what should I do?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.999
I don't know.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.836
But you're her brother.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.088
You better do something.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.350
Something's wrong, Colin--
this stuff tastes weird.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.519
I'm not getting a buzz at all.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.020
{\an3}We got ripped
off, Kelly.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.897
I don't know
what this is,

24:00.981 --> 24:03.150
{\an3}but it sure the
hell isn't cocaine.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.985
Wh-What were you thinking?

24:05.068 --> 24:06.987
Didn't you taste it
before you got it?

24:07.070 --> 24:09.489
Yeah, sure, right in the middle
of a dark alley

24:09.573 --> 24:11.491
I'm gonna test the merchandise.

24:11.575 --> 24:12.993
{\an3}He could've had
a gun, Kelly.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.911
Congratulations,
you just blew 60 bucks.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.164
{\an1}Yeah, well,
if you hadn't hoovered up

24:17.247 --> 24:19.416
the last of the stash,
we'd be fine now, wouldn't we?

24:19.499 --> 24:21.001
Who are you calling?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.586
Paul.

24:22.669 --> 24:23.920
It's Colin.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.839
S.O.S., man.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.591
I thought you said
he didn't have any.

24:27.674 --> 24:30.510
Just give us
a pinch of yours until...

24:30.594 --> 24:32.512
I'll pay double.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.931
I said I'll pay double.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.019
Outstanding.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.395
I'll be right over.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.899
Bye.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.358
Go. Hurry up.

24:47.652 --> 24:48.695
(door opens, closes)

25:04.669 --> 25:06.421
{\an3}Get... get in
a good stretch,

25:06.504 --> 25:08.465
{\an3}because today we're up
for a serious run.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.090
Oh, of course we are.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.718
We're serious people here.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.221
{\an1}So, you know that
press release we got on Joe

25:14.304 --> 25:16.556
{\an1}from the athletic
Yeah.tment?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.308
Yeah, it's a snow job.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.727
{\an3}You mean there is something
wrong with his ankle?

25:20.810 --> 25:22.938
{\an1}No, not his ankle,
his heart.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.064
{\an3}His heart?

25:24.147 --> 25:26.441
{\an1}Yeah. I talked to Donna
off the record.

25:26.524 --> 25:30.403
She said Joe may have some sort
of congenital heart defect.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.279
Oh, no.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.990
{\an1}Oh, yes. But there are
differing opinions.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.450
{\an1}Two doctors,
two diagnoses.

25:35.533 --> 25:39.079
Turns out one of the doctors
is Donna's father.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.747
And doc number two?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.791
Recommended
by the athletic department.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.460
Oh, man.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.920
{\an3}So, what's Joe
going to do?

25:47.003 --> 25:48.964
{\an1}He's listening to the guy
that says he's fine

25:49.047 --> 25:50.590
{\an1}so he can keep
playing football.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.592
{\an3}How convenient for
the athletic department.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.970
{\an3}So, when are you
gonna interview Joe?

25:55.053 --> 25:56.137
I'm not.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.056
We aren't covering this story.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.140
Are you crazy?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.976
The athletic department
is putting up a smoke screen

26:01.059 --> 26:02.978
around its star quarterback,
and you're gonna do nothing?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.938
{\an1}I told you, it was
off the record.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.064
Well, then go
<i>on</i> the record.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.024
Look.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.234
Joe's my friend.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.696
If we even hint that there
may be something wrong with him,

26:12.779 --> 26:14.239
we could jeopardize
his entire career.

26:14.322 --> 26:16.908
No, Brandon.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.327
{\an3}Joe is doing that
all by himself.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.628
{\an3}This sucks.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.547
{\an1}Yeah, it's penance
for our sins--

26:30.630 --> 26:32.132
it's supposed to suck.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.009
Welcome jawbreakers.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.385
Of course,
I mean lawbreakers.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.553
In case you're lost,

26:36.636 --> 26:38.388
this is the Last Laugh
Traffic School.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.848
My name is Lou Nebitts,

26:39.931 --> 26:42.017
but before you go
calling me "Mrs. Nebbish,"

26:42.100 --> 26:44.185
let me remind you
that I have control

26:44.269 --> 26:45.353
over your driving records.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.189
So feel free to laugh
whenever I say something funny.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.024
(laughs)

26:49.107 --> 26:50.191
That wasn't funny.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.359
You're telling me.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.694
Any comedian
with talent

26:52.777 --> 26:54.821
{\an6}is not gonna
be headlining
traffic school.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.031
NEBITTS:
All right, then,

26:56.114 --> 27:00.076
who can tell me what is the
cause of most moving violations?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.328
Speeding?

27:01.411 --> 27:03.079
{\an1}NEBITTS:
Illegal turns?

27:03.163 --> 27:06.041
Internal combustion.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.710
Have you ever taken
this class before?

27:08.793 --> 27:09.711
No.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.712
Obviously not.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.047
Because you don't know

27:12.130 --> 27:13.715
the first rule
of Lou Nebitts' traffic school--

27:13.798 --> 27:16.217
"Never be funnier
than the teacher."

27:16.301 --> 27:17.886
(sarcastic laugh)

27:17.969 --> 27:19.054
But seriously, folks,

27:19.137 --> 27:21.139
the major cause
of most moving violations

27:21.222 --> 27:23.391
is poor time management.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.227
So, what'd they
nab you for, Shecky?

27:26.311 --> 27:27.228
Oh, this is all her fault.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.022
{\an3}CLARE:
Yeah, you wish.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.398
You know, I should've trusted
my instincts and gone

27:30.482 --> 27:32.275
{\an1}Then why
don't you justffic school.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.693
change your major to home ec?

27:33.777 --> 27:34.903
NEBITTS:
This seems like there's

27:34.986 --> 27:37.572
a little unresolved anger--
maybe you two should have gone

27:37.655 --> 27:39.407
to conflict-avoidance
traffic school.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.035
Then we never
would ha(coughs)ou, Lou.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.245
I don't... know him,
he's just...

27:44.329 --> 27:46.081
Aren't they cute?
The fighting Wallendas.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.041
Tell me, do you fight in bed?

27:48.124 --> 27:49.459
Yep.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.211
{\an1}It's none
of your business.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.087
(laughter)

27:52.170 --> 27:54.047
{\an1}And what are you
laughing at?

27:54.130 --> 27:55.965
(laughs)

27:57.884 --> 28:00.053
VALEBRANDON: <i> Mm-hmm.ut?</i>

28:00.136 --> 28:02.097
{\an1}Kelly dropped
that off for you.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.598
I don't know.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.266
{\an1}I'm waiting
to find out-- open it.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.102
No occasion.ccasion?

28:07.185 --> 28:08.478
She and Colin came by

28:08.561 --> 28:11.314
{\an1}giving gifts to all
her friends-- me included.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.236
It's a Mont Blanc pen.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.987
{\an1}A sterling silver
Mont Blanc pen.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.781
{\an1}Do you know
what that's worth?

28:19.864 --> 28:21.241
That's, like, over $600.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.492
No way.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.119
They must've been flying.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.954
Either that or Kelly's
gone completely crazy.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.957
{\an3}Wait a second, are you
saying that Kelly was high?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.750
I don't think it, I know it.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.253
I can't believe that.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.422
You know what,
you're like everybody else.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.590
You can't believe
that little Miss Perfect

28:37.674 --> 28:38.842
can do anything wrong.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.531
(muffled groan)

29:01.614 --> 29:04.200
The light is driving me crazy--
I can't get to sleep.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.493
It's not the light

29:05.577 --> 29:07.495
that's keeping you up,
believe me.

29:08.705 --> 29:12.000
I feel like
I haven't slept in days.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.002
You haven't.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.504
I can't keep doing this.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.048
(phone rings)

29:19.132 --> 29:20.925
Aren't you gonna get that?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.219
No. I don't want
to talk to anybody.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.929
COLIN (recorded):
All right, you called.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.139
What's up?

29:26.222 --> 29:27.056
BRANDON:
Hey, Colin.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.141
Uh, it's me, Brandon.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.018
Actually, I'm calling for Kelly.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.520
Well, I guess I-I'm calling
for both of you guys.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.856
Thanks for the awesome pen,
although I have no idea

29:34.939 --> 29:35.857
what I did to deserve it.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.359
Just wanted to make sure
you guys are all right.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.195
People are starting to wonder.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.113
Give me a call, Kel. Bye.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.073
(line hangs up,
answering machine beeps)

29:44.157 --> 29:45.366
<i>Are</i> we all right?

29:45.450 --> 29:47.368
Wish I could
say the same.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.205
I got to get out of here--
I need some sleep.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.207
You'll be fine
once you crash.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.459
(sighs)ake some downers.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.173
Makes for softer landing.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.554
Lay down, and try
to close your eyes, okay?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.223
No, I can't.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.557
I want my own bed.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.142
I'm gonna go home, okay?

30:17.106 --> 30:20.276
(door opens, closes)

30:23.029 --> 30:25.323
MAN (over video):
There's a war going on

30:25.406 --> 30:27.075
on the highways of our country,

30:27.158 --> 30:28.243
and innocents
are being slaughtered

30:28.326 --> 30:31.454
by the drunken, the drugged,

30:31.538 --> 30:34.791
and those who just don't think.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.751
What right do they have

30:36.834 --> 30:39.587
to endanger my life, to threaten
my wife and my children?

30:39.671 --> 30:40.922
I mean, what right...

30:41.005 --> 30:42.757
Great flick you took me to.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.259
Enough already.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.095
I'm sick of being blamed
for something that you started.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.097
{\an3}Shh!

30:49.180 --> 30:52.058
You're a big boy--
you could've just said no.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.935
That's easy for you to say.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.314
We hope you enjoyed

30:58.398 --> 31:00.984
our feature presentation
of <i> Red Asphalt III.</i>

31:01.067 --> 31:04.487
Siskel and Ebert gave
this classic "two thumbs off."

31:07.490 --> 31:09.784
Good. You're finally
getting the picture.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.244
Speeding is no laughing matter.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.913
Now, why don't we take
that bathroom break.

31:13.997 --> 31:17.000
Some of you look
like you could use it.

31:20.253 --> 31:23.089
Yeah, it's Max.
How's it going?

31:23.172 --> 31:24.424
What?

31:24.507 --> 31:25.883
They didn't show up?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.094
But we tape in two hours!

31:33.224 --> 31:35.768
Um, yeah, look, um, don't worry,

31:35.852 --> 31:38.813
I'll figure something out, okay?

31:38.896 --> 31:41.316
{\an3}(chuckles)
Crisis on the set.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.484
Hey, listen, uh,
my name's Max Roman.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.863
I'm here because
I pulled a 180 on PCH,

31:46.946 --> 31:48.823
but I also happen to be
a producer of <i> Back Talk.</i>

31:48.906 --> 31:51.034
{\an1}Yeah, channel
nine, right?r watch it?

31:51.117 --> 31:53.161
WrongRight, right.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.996
(chuckling)

31:55.079 --> 31:57.874
You know, you two...
you two are dynamite.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.208
{\an3}No, no, look,
I want you

31:59.292 --> 32:01.669
{\an1}to come with me when
we get sprung out of here,

32:01.753 --> 32:03.338
and I want you
to tape a segment.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.714
It's called
"Tangled Up in Love."

32:04.797 --> 32:05.882
It's about couples
who keep fighting

32:05.965 --> 32:07.383
{\an1}all the time,
and we'll do that whole

32:07.467 --> 32:09.052
love-hate thing, huh?

32:09.135 --> 32:10.511
{\an1}Well, there's
no love-hate here.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.846
{\an3}Speak for
yourself, honOw!

32:11.929 --> 32:12.847
Now, it's not great money,

32:12.930 --> 32:15.058
but it is only gonna take
a couple of hours.

32:15.141 --> 32:16.059
{\an1}So, what do
you say, huh?

32:16.142 --> 32:16.726
Come on-- from one

32:16.809 --> 32:18.269
high-risk driver to another?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.021
Forget it.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.397
(Max chuckles)

32:21.481 --> 32:24.067
You're gonna be perfect.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.985
SUSAN:
<i>Listen, um,</i>

32:26.069 --> 32:27.862
{\an1}I heard from
the athletic department

32:27.945 --> 32:30.073
about Joe's heart.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.699
You did?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.868
{\an3}Yeah. Um...

32:33.951 --> 32:36.037
{\an3}I really feel bad
for him, Donna,

32:36.120 --> 32:37.705
and you, too.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.999
Yeah, well, the worst part is,

32:40.083 --> 32:42.085
Joe's pushing himself
even harder now.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.837
You know your father
is a great doctor.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.881
Um, what exactly

32:46.964 --> 32:47.840
was his diagnosis anyway?

32:47.924 --> 32:50.385
{\an3}I mean, I know it was
some type of, um,

32:50.468 --> 32:51.552
congenital heart defect.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.055
Well, I-I thought you talked

32:54.138 --> 32:56.349
to the athletic department--
they didn't tell you?

32:59.310 --> 33:01.354
{\an3}Um, you know,
actually, I got to go.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.731
{\an3}Um, maybe we can have
coffee some other time.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.191
Wait, Susan.

33:05.274 --> 33:08.111
You're not gonna write a story
about this, are you?

33:10.154 --> 33:11.906
I don't know.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.160
Hey, Susan.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.497
Hey.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.960
{\an1}What were you talking
to Susan about?

33:24.043 --> 33:26.587
Uh, nothing.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.215
Just like you were talking
to Brandon about nothing?

33:29.298 --> 33:31.008
These people run

33:31.092 --> 33:32.760
the school newspaper, Donna.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.096
These people are
my friends, Joe.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.098
{\an1}Oh, yeah, until they
think they've got a story.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.224
Then they're nobody's friends.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.101
That is not true.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.437
You know what?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.772
{\an3}I kind of hope they do
write a story about you.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.067
Because then maybe you'll pay
attention to common sense.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.069
If <i> The Condor</i> even suggests

33:50.153 --> 33:52.405
that there's something wrong
with me, I'm damaged goods.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.949
{\an1}That ends all hopes
I have for a pro career.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.412
What kind of career are you
gonna have if you're dead?

33:59.495 --> 34:01.038
Whose side are you on?

34:01.122 --> 34:02.790
Yours--

34:02.874 --> 34:05.168
if you'd just open your eyes
wide enough to see it.

34:25.521 --> 34:26.438
David.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.440
Hey.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.817
What's going on?

34:29.900 --> 34:32.152
{\an1}Nothing. I'm just looking
for Kelly. Is she here?

34:32.235 --> 34:33.862
{\an3}No, man, she got bored
watching me work.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.406
She took off a while ago.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.158
Is something wrong?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.369
{\an1}I don't know. I haven't
seen her in a while.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.829
{\an3}She's been
hanging out here.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.623
{\an3}Actually, she hasn't
been feeling that great.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.500
I've been taking good
care of her, though.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.376
That's good.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.170
Because I really care
about her, you know?

34:49.253 --> 34:52.005
Yeah, so do I.

34:52.089 --> 34:54.132
I'd do anything for Kelly,
you know that.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.428
Even share your drugs with her?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.017
Is that the line Valerie's
been feeding you?

35:03.100 --> 35:06.020
She's expressed her concern.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.022
I bet she has,
and I bet you

35:08.105 --> 35:09.982
{\an3}jumped all over it,
too, didn't you?

35:10.066 --> 35:11.692
{\an3}You and your girlfriend
are way off-base.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.361
Just stop, all right?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.821
I know when someone's using.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.030
I can tell by looking.

35:16.114 --> 35:16.989
Kelly's clean.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.199
So am I.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.367
Don't make me laugh.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.868
You know what?

35:20.952 --> 35:23.037
I don't need you
or any other 12-step convert

35:23.120 --> 35:25.331
coming into my house,
telling me my business.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.085
I don't care what you do,

35:29.168 --> 35:31.504
but if you don't stop giving
your drugs to my sister,

35:31.587 --> 35:34.173
the only thing you're gonna
find up your nose is my fist.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.094
You finished?

36:03.828 --> 36:04.453
Yeah, Beverly Hills, please.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.164
The number for a
Dr. John Martin.

36:08.165 --> 36:10.585
{\an1}What do you
think you're doing?

36:10.668 --> 36:12.086
I'm just checking the facts.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.421
Don't look at
me like that.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.256
{\an1}You're building a story,
one that I told you

36:15.339 --> 36:16.924
was officially off the record.

36:17.008 --> 36:17.925
For you, maybe.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.010
Look, I talked to Donna.

36:19.093 --> 36:21.095
{\an3}I talked to Kip Hardwick
in the Athletic Department.

36:21.178 --> 36:22.096
I talked to Dr. Levin,

36:22.179 --> 36:24.432
{\an3}the one who gave Joe
that clean bill of health.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.766
I've done it all on my own

36:25.850 --> 36:27.435
without involving
or compromising you.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.936
You're unbelievable.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.938
Look, I don't even
have to use Joe's name.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.773
I can slant the whole story

36:32.857 --> 36:35.234
{\an3}around the manipulation of
the Athletic Department.

36:35.318 --> 36:38.195
The religion of football,
winning at any cost.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.614
And what about getting
a story at any cost?

36:39.697 --> 36:41.324
You're as bad as they are.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.199
Joe is putting himself at risk

36:42.283 --> 36:43.201
by ignoring the advice
of Dr. Martin,

36:43.284 --> 36:45.745
a widely respected
cardiologist, I might add.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.622
That's Joe's decision
to make, not yours.

36:47.705 --> 36:48.581
Look, I know

36:48.664 --> 36:50.249
Joe is your friend,
Brandon, but how much

36:50.333 --> 36:51.709
are you willing
to risk for friendship?

36:51.792 --> 36:53.628
You mean to tell me
if you found out Joe was

36:53.711 --> 36:55.922
{\an3}point-shaving you wouldn't
run a story on that?

36:56.005 --> 36:58.132
Now, you're comparing
horseshoes and hand grenades.

36:58.215 --> 36:59.884
Am I?

37:01.552 --> 37:02.970
Drop the story.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.444
There you are.

37:18.527 --> 37:19.904
Hey. What's up?

37:19.987 --> 37:21.447
What the hell you
trying to pull?

37:21.530 --> 37:22.865
Excuse me?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.158
{\an1}Siccing your
boyfriend on me?

37:24.241 --> 37:25.493
Real smooth, Val--
what other tricks

37:25.576 --> 37:26.786
can you make
him do for you?

37:26.869 --> 37:28.704
Wait, I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.664
{\an1}Like hell
you don't.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.624
You sent David
over to threaten <i> me?</i>

37:31.707 --> 37:33.292
{\an3}Hey, I didn't send
David anywhere.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.835
He figured out what was going on

37:34.919 --> 37:37.129
with you and Kelly all
by himself. We all did.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.714
Yeah, well, you're
all out of line.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.634
{\an1}You and everyone else, leave
Kelly and me alone, all right?

37:41.717 --> 37:43.302
Stay out of our lives!

37:43.386 --> 37:45.054
Colin. Listen to me.

37:45.137 --> 37:48.057
They wouldn't be in your
life without Kelly, okay?

37:48.140 --> 37:49.934
They care about
her, not you.

37:51.894 --> 37:53.813
I'm the only one who does.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.026
Just keep them off my back.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.251
{\an3}What the hell are
we doing here?

38:15.334 --> 38:17.586
Why don't you
tell me, Clare?

38:17.670 --> 38:20.423
{\an3}I don't see the
point, all right?

38:20.506 --> 38:21.465
This is the point.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.719
I argue. You bitch. We fight.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.887
Now we get to do it
on national television.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.806
This is a local show, Steve.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.891
This is local?

38:30.975 --> 38:31.851
{\an1}We don't
get national

38:31.934 --> 38:32.768
{\an1}coverage
No. this?

38:32.852 --> 38:33.853
What are we doing here?

38:33.936 --> 38:35.521
{\an3}ROMAN:
My Hey, hey, hey.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.731
{\an3}Time out, okay?
Now, don't start in

38:36.814 --> 38:38.733
{\an3}on each other until
we're rolling.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.735
You guys are gonna be great.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.069
DIRECTOR:
And here we go!

38:42.153 --> 38:45.072
In five, four, three...

38:45.156 --> 38:46.240
two...and...

38:46.323 --> 38:48.284
(applause, whistles)

38:50.036 --> 38:52.747
Hi. Today on <i> Back Talk,</i>

38:52.830 --> 38:53.748
"Couples Who Can't Stop
Fighting."

38:53.831 --> 38:54.957
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:55.041 --> 38:57.251
let's welcome our first
combative couple,

38:57.335 --> 38:58.419
Steve and Clare.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.212
(applause, cheers)

39:03.507 --> 39:05.760
So, Steve, who's guilty
of all the bickering?

39:05.843 --> 39:06.761
Let me explain.

39:06.844 --> 39:07.678
{\an3}No, I'm not
gonna let you.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.430
{\an6}No, not if it
involves any
more blame.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.765
{\an1}Blame? it.

39:10.848 --> 39:11.682
What's he blame you for, Clare?

39:11.766 --> 39:14.602
{\an3}What does he bl...?
Okay, well, um...

39:14.685 --> 39:16.812
street racing,
getting busted,

39:16.896 --> 39:17.605
winding up in traffic school...

39:17.688 --> 39:18.731
Okay, okay!

39:18.814 --> 39:20.066
I'm not blaming you anymore.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.108
Thank you, okay?

39:21.192 --> 39:22.234
I want to thank you.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.235
{\an1}CLARE:
What?

39:23.319 --> 39:24.445
I'm a little lost here, Steve.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.446
{\an3}Me, too.

39:25.529 --> 39:26.280
Well, don't you see?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.782
{\an1}Don't you see where
all this fighting

39:27.865 --> 39:29.241
{\an1}and bickering
and arguing

39:29.325 --> 39:30.618
has gotten us?

39:30.701 --> 39:31.660
On some dinky local talk show?

39:31.744 --> 39:32.620
{\an1}No.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.580
Behind the wheels
of two speeding cars.

39:34.663 --> 39:35.623
I'm glad we
got caught.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.166
Thank God we
got caught,

39:37.249 --> 39:40.002
because I could've
gotten you hurt... or worse.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.631
Well, it's not all your fault.

39:43.714 --> 39:44.965
If anything ever
happened to you

39:45.049 --> 39:46.675
or that cute little
brain of yours,

39:46.759 --> 39:48.552
I don't think I could
ever forgive myself.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.015
AUDIENCE:
Aw...

39:54.683 --> 39:55.601
(applause)

39:55.684 --> 39:56.602
(groans)

39:56.685 --> 39:58.020
What do you mean,

39:58.104 --> 40:02.817
my cute <i> little</i> brain?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.318
It was an endearment term.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.779
{\an4}CLARE:
Oh, it didn't sound
very endearing to me.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.614
You know, you calling me cute,
that's kind of what got us

40:08.697 --> 40:10.533
in this whole mess in the
first place. You remember?

40:10.616 --> 40:11.951
{\an1}Would you prefer "sporty"?
You got a cute,

40:12.034 --> 40:13.119
You're impossible.n?

40:13.202 --> 40:14.787
Yeah, you're impos...

40:14.870 --> 40:15.704
{\an1}The only
point'soint at me!

40:15.788 --> 40:17.456
{\an1}on top of your head,
but you tease your hair,

40:17.540 --> 40:18.874
Don't point at me!.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.876
{\an1}I won't point at you, okay?
I won't even talk to you?

40:22.878 --> 40:24.380
(door closes)

40:25.965 --> 40:26.882
Kel.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.467
God, am I glad to see you.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.635
Hey.

40:29.718 --> 40:30.678
You don't look so good.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.679
Are you okay?

40:31.762 --> 40:32.680
Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.098
I'm just tired.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.641
Oh, yeah. I'm beat, too.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.560
Joe and I have been on such
an emotional roller-coaster

40:37.643 --> 40:38.811
the past few days,
you wouldn't even

40:38.894 --> 40:40.521
believe it, Kel..

40:40.604 --> 40:41.522
Kel?

40:41.605 --> 40:43.190
Hmm?

40:44.650 --> 40:45.693
Nothing.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.069
I just, I thought we could talk.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.612
Can't it wait?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.698
I came home to get some sleep.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.409
Oh. Yeah, I just,

40:53.492 --> 40:55.035
I haven't see you in so long,

40:55.119 --> 40:56.704
and I kind of needed
your advice.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.622
I can't do it right now.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.583
I'm too tired.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.344
(indistinct shouting)

41:40.498 --> 41:42.500
He looks healthy enough.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.001
What are you doing here?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.088
{\an1}I, uh... just thought
I'd come by

41:48.172 --> 41:50.174
and tell you that
I wrote the story.

41:52.509 --> 41:54.094
(sighs)

41:54.178 --> 41:57.097
"Medical Condition
of Condor Q.B. Questionable.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.434
Possible Athletic
Department Cover-Up."

42:00.518 --> 42:03.562
{\an3}I can't believe you're
gonna run this.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.565
I'm not.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.448
That was some
of the best stuff I ever wrote.

42:14.531 --> 42:16.867
Then why'd you tear it up?

42:19.703 --> 42:22.623
{\an1}I guess I started
thinking about my sister.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.124
And what she meant to me.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.751
And...?

42:25.834 --> 42:28.420
And... I don't

42:28.504 --> 42:29.880
want to hurt Joe.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.177
There's always another story.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.930
Well, I appreciate that.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.807
I'm sure Joe will, too.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.314
What if he wasn't a friend?
Would you run the story then?

42:48.774 --> 42:49.858
Yeah, I would.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.832
{\an1}I hope we're doing
the right thing, Brandon.

43:04.915 --> 43:07.626
{\an1}What if there's
something wrong with him?

43:07.710 --> 43:09.003
Don't even think it.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.629
Buy you a martini?

43:10.713 --> 43:12.715
Sure. I could use one.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.222
Hey, you.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.057
Hi.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.393
{\an3}Listen, I just came
by to apologize.

43:24.476 --> 43:27.479
I mean, it's your
life, your body,

43:27.563 --> 43:29.565
your decision.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.445
I love you, Donna.

43:34.528 --> 43:35.487
And I'm gonna be fine.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.864
Everything's gonna be okay.

43:36.947 --> 43:37.906
I know.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.408
Listen, why don't
I finish up here

43:39.491 --> 43:40.993
and then I'll take
you out for dinner?

43:41.076 --> 43:43.579
Okay, but only if you
take a Deal.r first.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.705
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.290
I'll be ready.

43:55.132 --> 43:58.177
(gasping)

44:02.139 --> 44:03.182
Whoa.
