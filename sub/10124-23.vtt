00:07.967 --> 00:09.834
SHAWN, YOU'VE LIVED HERE
THREE WEEKS,

00:09.834 --> 00:12.000
AND YOU'VE BEEN IN
THE BATHROOM 2 1/2 OF THEM.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.100
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
I'M TRYING TO STUDY
HERE.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.133
WELL, I AM.

00:16.133 --> 00:20.000
WELL, I'M TRYING
TO TAKE A SHOWER HERE.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.800

00:30.500 --> 00:32.600
ESPECIALLY ON MY MOM'S SIDE.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.700
O.K.

AS GLUTTONY IS TO..."

00:37.767 --> 00:39.567

00:39.567 --> 00:40.700

00:42.700 --> 00:44.500

00:44.500 --> 00:46.800
AND I'M NEVER EVEN
GOING TO GET INTO...

00:46.800 --> 00:50.300
YOU KNOW--THAT PLACE
WITH THE...
IT'S GOT THE...

00:50.300 --> 00:51.300
COLLEGE?

00:51.300 --> 00:52.367
COLLEGE!

00:52.367 --> 00:54.867
I GOT TO
WRITE THAT DOWN.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.233
WHERE'S MY PENCIL?

00:56.233 --> 00:58.600
WHERE'S MY LUCKY PENCIL?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.066
HEY. IS THIS IT?

01:00.066 --> 01:04.667
OH, THANK YOU,
PENCIL, YOU'VE
COME BACK TO ME.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.500
HEY, HUNTER.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.567

01:11.867 --> 01:15.200
WITH TOWELIE,
MY LUCKY TOWEL?
ARE YOU INSANE?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.233
ONE OF US IS.

01:18.233 --> 01:20.400
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO LIVE HERE,

01:20.400 --> 01:21.700
THERE'S A FEW
RULES YOU'RE--

01:21.700 --> 01:23.200
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.600
HAPPY FACES, HUH?

01:24.600 --> 01:25.934
WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.400
IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.700
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
I THINK WE'RE DOING
PRETTY DARN WELL.

01:30.700 --> 01:35.367
I THINK I'LL GET
A LITTLE PEACE
AND QUIET IN HERE.

01:35.367 --> 01:36.867
HA HA HA HA!

01:38.834 --> 01:41.100
I THINK
HE JUST FOUND SLIPPY,

01:41.100 --> 01:42.467
HIS LUCKY SOAP.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.934
MORGAN.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.000
ICE CREAM
IS NOT BREAKFAST.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.133
SHAWN SAYS HIS FAMILY

01:52.133 --> 01:55.200
HAS SUNDAES FOR BREAKFAST
ALL THE TIME.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.000
REALLY?
YOU HEAR THAT, AMY?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.667
NUTRITIONAL TIPS
FROM THE HUNTER FAMILY.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.133
OH, ALAN,
SHAWN IS JUST SO...

02:03.233 --> 02:06.667
MORGAN, WOULDN'T YOU JUST
LOVE TO GO WATCH TV NOW?

02:06.667 --> 02:07.667
NO.

02:07.667 --> 02:08.934
FOR A BUCK?

02:08.934 --> 02:09.934

02:09.934 --> 02:12.200
GO ON,
GET OUT OF HERE.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.467
I LIKE SHAWN,
BUT THESE PAST
THREE WEEKS

02:15.467 --> 02:16.600
HAVE NOT BEEN
THE EASIEST--

02:16.600 --> 02:18.734
ON OUR NERVES
OR OUR BUDGET.

02:18.734 --> 02:19.734
IT ISN'T SHAWN'S FAULT.

02:19.734 --> 02:21.734
I DON'T BLAME HIM.
I BLAME CHET.

02:21.734 --> 02:24.667
WHAT KIND OF FATHER
ABANDONS HIS SON
LIKE THAT?

02:24.667 --> 02:27.200
NO PHONE CALL,
NO CARD, NOTHING.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.000
I'M JUST GLAD
SHAWN HAS CORY AND ERIC

02:30.000 --> 02:31.600
TO MAKE THINGS EASIER
FOR HIM.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.800
WELL, PARDON ME, ERIC,

02:32.800 --> 02:35.400
FOR BREATHING
YOUR LUCKY AIR.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.734
GOOD MORNING.
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME BREAKFAST?

02:37.734 --> 02:40.000
NO, THANKS.
I'LL HELP MYSELF.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.700
YEAH.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.934

02:48.934 --> 02:51.667
"A CUP? WHO YOU TRYING
TO IMPRESS?"

02:53.100 --> 02:54.967
WELL, THEN, WE'LL JUST

02:54.967 --> 02:57.567
MAKE THAT YOUR CARTON.

03:00.667 --> 03:04.133

I BOUGHT YOU SOME PANTS.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.600
YOU BOUGHT HIM
CLOTHES?

03:06.600 --> 03:10.000
WELL, ALAN, HE CAN'T JUST WEAR
THE SAME THING EVERY DAY.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.200
I DO.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.400
YOU KNOW THOSE JEANS
WITH ALL THE HOLES
IN THEM?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.867
YOU DIDN'T
CHUCK 'EM, DID YOU?

03:16.867 --> 03:18.867
OH, NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.500

THE SAME SHIRT.

03:49.367 --> 03:50.367
HI.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.367
SORRY I TOOK OFF
SO EARLY THIS MORNING.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.367
OH, THAT'S O.K.

03:53.367 --> 03:56.367

AT MY PLACE LAST NIGHT.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.500
I KNOW, SILLY.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.700
LEAVE IT IN THE BAG,
PLEASE.

03:59.700 --> 04:03.000
I'VE GOT OTHERS.
YOU CAN KEEP THIS
AT YOUR PLACE.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.700
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO PUT IT.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.500
DON'T GET SCARED
EVERY TIME I LEAVE
SOMETHING AT YOUR PLACE.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.567
I'M NOT SCARED.

04:09.567 --> 04:12.800
I'D BE SCARED
IF I STARTED WEARING IT.

04:13.867 --> 04:14.900
KATHERINE, JONATHAN.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.300
ARE YOU BROWN-BAGGING IT?

04:16.300 --> 04:18.767
I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING LUNCH.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.100
ACTUALLY, GEORGE,
IT'S MINE.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.233
AND NOT EXACTLY

IS IN ORDER.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.967

MY MOM GAVE YOU?

04:37.967 --> 04:40.400
YEAH. LOOKS ALL RIGHT
NOW, HUH?

04:40.400 --> 04:43.500
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'LL DO
WHEN SHE SEES THAT?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.300
MY GUESS IS, CLEAN IT,
SEW IT BACK TOGETHER,

04:46.300 --> 04:48.033
AND PUT AN "S" ON IT.

04:48.033 --> 04:50.200
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO BE NICE TO YOU.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.100
AND I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET THROUGH THIS

WITH HUNTER?

04:59.767 --> 05:00.834

05:00.834 --> 05:01.834

05:01.834 --> 05:02.867
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.300

THE OFFER STANDS.

AND ONLY HIS TEACHER.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.100
YOU'D DO WELL
TO REMEMBER THAT.

WITH THE MATTHEWS KIDS.

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE

05:40.200 --> 05:42.567

05:42.567 --> 05:46.233
ALL RIGHT, HERE IT COMES.
YOUR SCORE IS...

05:46.233 --> 05:47.667
190.

05:47.667 --> 05:48.667

05:48.667 --> 05:49.800
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.200

JUST FOR SIGNING
YOUR NAME.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.967
YOU'VE BEEN UP FOR DAYS.

06:02.967 --> 06:04.233
YOUR SCORES KEEP FALLING.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.834
AT THIS RATE,
YOU COULDN'T GET INTO
CLOWN COLLEGE.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.800
IS THAT
A FOUR-YEAR SCHOOL?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.500
YOUR BRAIN NEEDS A BREAK.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.667
NO, BRAIN DOESN'T
NEED BREAK.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.834
BRAIN NEEDS OXYGEN.

06:14.834 --> 06:17.967
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH
OXYGEN IN HERE.

06:17.967 --> 06:20.400
BUT THERE'S SOME

06:25.567 --> 06:26.900
GOOD OLD H2O.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.500
I FEEL SMARTER ALREADY.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.133
DO I LOOK SMARTER?

06:30.133 --> 06:33.800
HAS YOUR HOUSE
BEEN TESTED FOR RADON?

06:34.900 --> 06:36.667
NOT ANOTHER TEST.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.400
I'M GOING HOME.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.400
OH, FINE.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.400

06:50.300 --> 06:52.400
YEAH, ME, TOO.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.500
YOU KNOW, ALL STUDENTS
FEEL ANXIETY

06:56.500 --> 06:58.667
GOING INTO
THEIR COLLEGE BOARDS.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.734
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
AROUND IT.

07:00.734 --> 07:02.500
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.400
MR. FEENY,
I'M NOT READY.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.734
ERIC, I ONCE PROMISED

07:06.734 --> 07:09.567
THAT I WOULD NEVER
REVEAL THIS
TO ANY STUDENT.

07:09.567 --> 07:12.400
BUT THERE ARE
THREE SECRETS
TO SCORING WELL

07:12.400 --> 07:13.734
ON THE S.A.T.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.100
SECRETS THAT WOULD

07:21.867 --> 07:24.000
PERHAPS I WILL...

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000

07:26.000 --> 07:27.934
MR. FEENY, YOU SLY DOG.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.400
IF YOU WOULD HELP ME--

07:39.400 --> 07:40.700
YOU'LL TELL ME
THE SECRETS?

07:55.233 --> 07:57.934
IT'S A VERY COOL DOG.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.834
IT'S A STRAY.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.934

'CAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE
A HOME.

LIKE HE DOESN'T HAVE
A FRIEND IN THE WORLD.

BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS,
DON'T YOU?

19:39.600 --> 19:43.200
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
A STRAY ANYMORE.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.667
YEAH.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.500
SO, UH, WHAT'S IT LIKE

19:46.500 --> 19:48.767
TO BE A HOUSEBROKEN DOG?

19:48.767 --> 19:49.800
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.000
I MEAN, YOU GET
YOUR MEALS REGULAR.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.100
YOU GET YOUR OWN
CHEW TOY.

19:55.100 --> 19:59.700
AND IF YOU
BRING IN THE PAPER,
THEY'RE SO THRILLED.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.667
WHAT IF I HATE IT?

20:01.667 --> 20:03.967
I'LL HAVE MY MOM AND DAD

20:03.967 --> 20:06.500
PUT IN A DOGGIE DOOR
FOR YOU.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.467
JUST LEAVE THE WINDOW OPEN.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.500
YOU GOT IT.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.000
ALL RIGHT, MR. FEENY,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.600
I'VE BEEN PLANTING
AND HEDGING AND MOWING

20:29.600 --> 20:31.000
FOR THREE DAYS NOW.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
THE S.A.T.s ARE TOMORROW.
I DEMAND TO KNOW
THE THREE SECRETS.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.600
GET A GOOD NIGHT'S
SLEEP.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.800
NO WAY. NOT UNTIL
YOU TELL ME THE SECRETS.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.033
I JUST TOLD YOU ONE--
SLEEP.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.367
I CAN'T SLEEP.
THE TEST IS TOMORROW.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.967
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT IT IN DAYS.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.200
WHICH IS
SECRET NUMBER TWO.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.600
CLEAR YOUR MIND.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.900
CARE TO TAKE A GUESS

20:50.900 --> 20:52.500
AT WHAT SECRET
NUMBER THREE IS?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.467
YOU'RE SATAN?

20:58.734 --> 21:02.567
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME, MR. FEENY?

21:02.567 --> 21:06.133
ERIC, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT S.A.T. MEANS?

21:06.133 --> 21:08.200
SAT?

21:11.100 --> 21:13.700
SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE
TEST.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.400
IT MEASURES
WHAT'S UP HERE--

21:15.400 --> 21:17.600
YOUR NATURAL ABILITY
TO LEARN.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.500
SO CLEAR YOUR MIND,
GET SOME SLEEP,
AND TRUST YOURSELF.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.000
THOSE ARE
THE THREE SECRETS.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.500
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.367
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

21:30.367 --> 21:31.900
WHOA!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:31.900 --> 21:33.867
THERE'S STILL THE MATTER
OF PRUNING MY AZALEAS.

21:33.867 --> 21:35.367
THE AZALEAS.
OF COURSE.

21:35.367 --> 21:37.367
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT NOW.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.300
PSYCH!

21:38.300 --> 21:40.734
YOU ALREADY TOLD ME
THE THREE SECRETS.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.500
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.367
DID I SAY THREE?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.200
PSYCH!
