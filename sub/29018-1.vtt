05:26.374 --> 05:30.214
- What is your favorite food, Ulrik?
- Ice cream.

05:30.374 --> 05:34.975
Do the rest of you like
ice cream as well? Yes, of course!

05:35.135 --> 05:38.175
- What about you?
- I love broccoli.

05:38.335 --> 05:41.775
What do you mean?
I have a best friend...

10:10.935 --> 10:16.375
- Hi.
- Good to see you again.

10:21.134 --> 10:23.575
Finally!

10:23.734 --> 10:27.014
- Did you miss me that much?
- Yes.

10:31.295 --> 10:33.455
It's nice, right?

10:38.534 --> 10:41.334
How did you like the hotel?

10:41.494 --> 10:44.335
- The hotel?
- Yes. Did you like it?

10:44.494 --> 10:48.054
Well... It's a bit tacky, maybe.

10:49.055 --> 10:51.415
Okay, tacky...

10:52.415 --> 10:56.455
Suddenly, it's not good enough
for the little princess?

10:58.734 --> 11:01.095
- Well, yes...
- Yes.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.494
Maybe just a bit...

11:05.494 --> 11:09.654
- They played the cheese song.
- The cheese song?

11:09.815 --> 11:14.695
Roquefort, Emmental and Gorgonzola
I'll pay anything

11:19.654 --> 11:22.934
I just invested
a shitload of money in it.

11:23.095 --> 11:28.095
- I think they make good money.
- I damn well hope so.

11:40.975 --> 11:43.695
It's nice to be here.

11:50.575 --> 11:55.374
- And Bobby? Was everything okay?
- Yes.

11:56.494 --> 12:01.494
Good.
Thanks, babe. Welcome to the family.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.854
Thanks.

12:48.695 --> 12:53.135
- Mom, look at me. I'm a crocodile.
- Dangerous crocodile!

12:57.215 --> 12:59.935
Oh, you look mean!

13:08.935 --> 13:11.815
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, honey.

13:11.975 --> 13:14.935
- Fuck, this is sweet.
- Totally.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.654
- Did he build it himself?
- Yep. From scratch.

13:18.815 --> 13:22.575
Be careful not to get sunburned,
Karsten.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.335
Good dog, Musse!

14:31.295 --> 14:33.455
Those.

14:42.774 --> 14:47.054
- Whoa.
- They're just the ones I liked best.

14:47.215 --> 14:51.575
I promised.
I keep my promises.

14:51.734 --> 14:55.134
Shit. You are a true princess, eh?

14:55.295 --> 14:59.495
I'd better load some more
onto the next shipment.

14:59.654 --> 15:02.694
You know that emeralds
are more expensive than diamonds?

15:02.854 --> 15:06.215
- They are?
- A lot.

15:06.374 --> 15:10.774
So I think I've found myself
a lady with taste.

15:12.894 --> 15:16.975
- Thanks.
- Are you happy?

15:17.134 --> 15:19.934
- Can we afford them?
- Of course.

15:20.095 --> 15:23.894
- They're a little ladylike.
- Hey, here she comes.

15:24.055 --> 15:27.935
- No way, honey!
- You look so good.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.695
What did you do, Michael?
Did you splash out?

15:31.854 --> 15:35.055
They are damn neat.
Can I touch them?

15:35.215 --> 15:39.055
- Can I borrow them sometime?
- Are they brilliants?

15:39.215 --> 15:42.695
- Enough. Come on.
- You're so beautiful, man!

15:42.854 --> 15:45.774
Come on, Sascha.
Come on, Bo!

15:48.415 --> 15:50.815
Yeah, go!

15:57.254 --> 16:00.534
Come on, Karsten!

16:03.254 --> 16:05.894
Come on!

16:16.335 --> 16:21.254
Guess, I'm getting it now.
Mastic. And...

16:21.415 --> 16:26.215
This one's called "fool". I want that.
Can I have some fool?

16:28.295 --> 16:30.935
There you go.

17:30.734 --> 17:33.814
Sascha, your turn. Sascha!

17:36.494 --> 17:39.135
Sascha, it's your turn.

17:45.734 --> 17:50.494
What's going on here?
Please turn down the music.

17:50.655 --> 17:53.575
You're disturbing everyone here
at the beach.

17:53.734 --> 17:58.574
Everyone here is on vacation and want
to relax. Please turn down the music.

17:58.734 --> 18:01.534
Michael, what is he saying?

18:01.695 --> 18:05.655
Turn down the music.
We've paid a fortune for this vacation.

18:05.814 --> 18:10.334
- I think he likes my swimming trunks.
- Do you like his trunks? Dirty old man!

18:10.494 --> 18:13.574
Turn off the music.

18:13.734 --> 18:17.854
- If you don't do it, I will...
- Stop!

18:25.814 --> 18:29.455
- Nice one.
- Shot him. Shoot, shoot!

18:29.615 --> 18:33.695
Fuck off! Bye, bye.

18:33.855 --> 18:38.975
- And he buggers off to his boyfriend.
- What an idiot.

18:44.534 --> 18:49.734
That's not yours.
You little thieving girl.

18:54.135 --> 18:58.295
We haven't been lucky with her.
Have we?

18:58.455 --> 19:02.014
- I heard that, Bo.
- Sure.

19:04.734 --> 19:09.774
- What are you doing? Stop!
- You're going to pay for that.

19:09.935 --> 19:13.135
Don't you have something
I can throw at her?

19:13.294 --> 19:15.854
Here's an onion for you!

19:17.135 --> 19:21.734
- That's fucking nice.
- No, stop. Stop it!

19:21.895 --> 19:26.975
- Who's that? Anyone know him?
- Shut up. It's work.

20:05.135 --> 20:10.175
Ladies and gentlemen.
The bar will open now.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.174
And it's happy hour!

20:16.655 --> 20:19.135
That's sick.

20:19.294 --> 20:22.254
I think happy hour
is mostly around here.

20:23.574 --> 20:26.574
Christ, it's good.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.415
I feel like dancing.
Come on, let's dance.

21:12.534 --> 21:15.695
I mixed a little luxury drink for you.

25:44.455 --> 25:47.534
I have to. That's all well and good.

25:47.695 --> 25:51.294
The shipment
will be around 2.5 million, right?

25:51.455 --> 25:54.895
We can handle that.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.814
And if we transfer 500,000 now -

25:58.975 --> 26:02.975
- then they'll receive
a down payment of three million.

26:03.135 --> 26:07.655
And then we take the rest of the money
from the white account...

26:09.494 --> 26:15.054
That will be fine.
No problem.

26:15.215 --> 26:20.175
- Don't you think?
- Yes. I've got it under control.

26:20.334 --> 26:24.134
That's cool. We'll do that.

26:24.294 --> 26:28.215
Look. I have a suggestion.

26:35.215 --> 26:39.175
- What kind of fish is this?
- Sea bass.

26:39.334 --> 26:42.294
- Is it like cod?
- No.

26:42.455 --> 26:47.135
The texture is quite delicious, buttery.

26:47.294 --> 26:51.414
You have
to work hard to make cod like that.

26:51.574 --> 26:55.334
- You want this boiled cock?
- I want that, if it's pee.

26:55.494 --> 26:59.294
It was in your honor, Bo,
you old fisherman.

26:59.455 --> 27:02.014
This is damn classy.

27:02.175 --> 27:07.014
I mean big fish, small fish,
octopuses and the cock.

27:07.175 --> 27:11.375
- Japanese porn fillets.
- Don't touch it, Musse.

27:11.534 --> 27:17.334
- Don't play with the food, Tanja.
- Seriously, there's white goo inside.

27:17.494 --> 27:21.334
I just saw an acquaintance.
I'll just go say hello.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.695
You would have been dead.

27:24.855 --> 27:29.695
It's one of many occasions
when I should have been dead!

28:10.935 --> 28:14.215
Don't you want some food, Emil?
Come on.

28:14.375 --> 28:17.375
Do you want some raw fish?

28:17.534 --> 28:20.734
- Maybe they have fries.
- Can we order him some fries?

28:20.895 --> 28:23.295
Of course.

28:23.455 --> 28:29.254
That's not a problem, Karsten.
You can talk with food in your mouth.

28:29.415 --> 28:35.935
Karsten, are you on your period?
Do you need to change your tampon?

28:36.094 --> 28:41.254
You have to talk with food in
your mouth. Otherwise, you can't talk.

28:42.254 --> 28:47.094
- Who was that?
- I met them in the ice cream shop.

28:47.254 --> 28:50.374
- You don't waste any time, eh?
- No.

28:52.294 --> 28:55.734
I'm hungry. And it tastes damn good.

28:57.574 --> 29:01.134
- Want one?
- No thanks.

29:04.254 --> 29:06.975
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:16.855 --> 31:20.175
Bam! He died right on the spot.

31:20.334 --> 31:22.734
Jump starter!

31:22.895 --> 31:27.135
Sure, I hit a little hard.
But what was I supposed to do?

31:27.294 --> 31:29.254
- Did you revive him?
- Yes.

31:29.415 --> 31:34.335
He was alive and kicking
five minutes later. What the hell.

31:34.494 --> 31:38.494
- They have to learn to behave!
- You have so many tall tales.

31:38.655 --> 31:42.734
Cheers, Michael.
It's a pleasure to be here with you.

31:44.655 --> 31:49.135
Another time, this guy came in.
He had a suitcase with 27 knives.

35:00.775 --> 35:03.255
She's cute, huh?

35:03.415 --> 35:08.175
- You can have a private show with her.
- I wouldn't dare.

38:12.775 --> 38:15.655
Don't worry. It'll pass.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.215
Everything passes with time.

38:21.214 --> 38:24.094
And then we're just dead.

38:30.534 --> 38:32.694
Remember that.

38:35.895 --> 38:40.054
Stop that shit. Musse, stop!

38:40.214 --> 38:43.694
Do you have it? Do you have it?

38:50.455 --> 38:54.295
Ah, okay. You don't need to see that.

38:56.255 --> 38:59.935
- Your turn. I'll hold that.
- Yes. Out of my way.

39:04.014 --> 39:06.415
Mama bear! Well done.

40:14.214 --> 40:17.254
It's in the direction
you come from, Torba.

40:17.415 --> 40:21.574
Yes, Torba, backwards, ahead.

40:23.375 --> 40:28.215
Hey, hey! The shawl.
The shawl, shawl.

40:28.375 --> 40:30.455
The shawl.

40:30.614 --> 40:35.774
The wheel of the scooter...
The shawl, tie it!

40:35.935 --> 40:38.054
Good bye.

42:06.094 --> 42:09.534
- Can you do a handstand, Musse?
- Yes.

42:09.694 --> 42:13.254
- Shall I show you?
- Yes. Can you do it?

42:36.574 --> 42:39.335
You have to eat it now.

42:39.494 --> 42:41.975
But I'm not hungry.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.775
Don't you like it?

42:47.935 --> 42:49.975
That's a first.

42:50.134 --> 42:52.574
- No!
- What?

42:55.455 --> 42:59.775
Something must have happened.
He didn't show up.

43:00.855 --> 43:05.655
What are you doing here, then?
What the hell are you doing here?

43:05.815 --> 43:11.135
- I'm sorry, Michael.
- You might have lead the police here.

43:11.295 --> 43:13.935
All the girls are here, dammit!

43:14.094 --> 43:17.455
- What the hell, Michael?
- Come down here.

43:17.614 --> 43:19.935
Don't, Michael...

43:24.014 --> 43:28.214
What's happening?
Is Michael going berserk?

43:28.375 --> 43:30.975
- Come here!
- No, no, no...

43:31.134 --> 43:36.054
Musse, don't move.
And listen to Michael, all right?

43:37.214 --> 43:40.934
- Should we go in there?
- Hell, no. Come here, honey.

43:41.094 --> 43:44.494
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Come. Go inside.

43:45.895 --> 43:48.455
Stop whining, Musse.

44:02.174 --> 44:04.935
I'll turn it up a bit.

44:20.335 --> 44:23.534
- That looks good.
- Do you want one?

44:23.694 --> 44:27.534
Can I? I would like that.

44:31.574 --> 44:34.694
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

44:41.295 --> 44:43.775
- Did you give Tanja one?
- No.

44:44.855 --> 44:49.534
- Can I have one? Thanks.
- You're welcome.

44:57.574 --> 45:01.134
Give him a kick in the belly.
It needs to hurt.

45:45.574 --> 45:48.254
Tanja, can't you make a bomb?

45:48.415 --> 45:52.654
- I need to make a bomb.
- How many times?

45:55.094 --> 45:59.134
- You've talked too much.
- I've stopped talking.

46:14.295 --> 46:17.575
Don't be sad.

46:34.494 --> 46:36.975
Don't.

46:38.975 --> 46:42.295
It hurts.
It hurts!

47:15.775 --> 47:18.575
Stop it.

47:52.375 --> 47:57.655
- Musse, you know I'm picky with gifts.
- The King gets a present for a king.

47:57.815 --> 48:01.335
- Is it a lighter?
- No, no.

48:02.335 --> 48:07.455
There! It's a jack-knife.
A one-hand jack-knife, man.

48:07.614 --> 48:11.694
That's actually pretty... It's cool.

48:11.855 --> 48:16.135
You can open it with one hand.
So if somebody gets in your face -

48:16.295 --> 48:19.775
- you take it out of your pocket,
and you're ready to go.

48:19.935 --> 48:24.735
- It's cool. You have good taste.
- Thanks!

48:28.214 --> 48:31.094
- Uh-oh. Now what?
- That's for me.

48:31.255 --> 48:34.175
- You bet.
- That's cool, Musse.

48:34.335 --> 48:37.855
That's a Turkish brandy.
I was in this shop -

48:38.014 --> 48:41.534
- thinking about whether
to give you whisky, vodka...

48:41.694 --> 48:45.294
But you've tasted it all.
Then the Turkish guy tells me:

48:45.455 --> 48:49.295
"Give him that. That's what we drink."
Does it taste good?

48:49.455 --> 48:52.455
- Damn good.
- He said it was the best.

48:52.614 --> 48:55.534
- Thanks, Musse.
- No problem, man.

48:56.694 --> 48:58.654
Here you go.

48:59.654 --> 49:03.854
- For the young lady.
- Thank you so much.

49:07.375 --> 49:10.335
Oh my.

49:10.494 --> 49:16.335
Do you like it? It's the one you wore
that got fucked up.

49:16.494 --> 49:22.014
- Well spotted, Musse.
- Thank you, Musse. Thank you.

49:22.174 --> 49:26.214
- Don't mention it. It looks good.
- Musse.

49:27.295 --> 49:29.855
I'm impressed.

49:30.855 --> 49:33.014
That is...

49:35.134 --> 49:39.975
I have something for you as well.
When you fuck up, you get punished.

49:40.134 --> 49:43.094
- I'm sorry I fucked up...
- Shut your hole.

49:43.255 --> 49:46.695
You didn't fuck up now, did you?
So this is for you.

49:46.855 --> 49:51.574
- A gift for me?
- I'm serious. It's for you. Come on.

49:51.735 --> 49:55.455
You can get a few champagne
bubble baths for that money.

49:55.614 --> 49:57.895
- No...
- Yes, yes.

49:58.054 --> 50:00.534
All of it isn't for me. Is it?

50:00.694 --> 50:04.374
Yes. When you do things right,
you get rewarded.

50:04.534 --> 50:08.774
Musse just got fucking rich!
Is it all for me?

50:08.935 --> 50:12.855
- No, man. Hey!
- All right. Yes.

50:13.014 --> 50:17.174
- Fucking thanks.
- You've earned it. I mean it.

50:17.335 --> 50:21.415
- Do things right.
- I will. That won't happen again.

50:21.574 --> 50:27.054
You can thank the man over there.
He just saved your ass.

50:27.214 --> 50:29.134
It's okay, Musse.

50:29.295 --> 50:34.055
Thank you, Bo. I'm sorry I fucked up.
Thanks for having my back.

50:34.214 --> 50:36.574
I appreciate it, man.

51:07.174 --> 51:12.894
Yes! It's karaoke time. Fucking karaoke!
Yeah.

51:13.054 --> 51:15.574
I fixed it! Are you ready?

51:15.735 --> 51:19.335
Time for some serious singing!
Jens, Jens.

51:19.494 --> 51:23.534
- Jens, Jens, Jens...!
- Jens, Jens, Jens...

51:23.694 --> 51:27.054
You have to sing, man. It's karaoke!

51:27.214 --> 51:30.334
Come on! You have to sing karaoke.

51:30.494 --> 51:34.694
- Come on. Jens, come on, man!
- That's it, Jens.

51:34.855 --> 51:38.735
Come on. Over here. There's
a gigantic selection of songs.

51:38.895 --> 51:40.895
Shit.

51:42.335 --> 51:44.335
What's this?

51:44.494 --> 51:47.455
- Don't you want to sing too?
- Hell no.

51:47.614 --> 51:53.254
I'm a technical genius, man.
You choose that one?

51:53.415 --> 51:56.574
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

51:56.735 --> 52:01.975
Are you good to go?
And you're on!

52:04.694 --> 52:09.814
- That's awesome.
- A fucking classic!

52:09.975 --> 52:13.255
- Come on, Jens!
- Bring it on.

52:13.415 --> 52:19.855
Call it love
Call it whatever you want

52:21.975 --> 52:26.775
No words exist
That are quite good enough

52:26.935 --> 52:31.054
So call it whatever you want

52:31.214 --> 52:34.414
Don't tell me what to do

52:34.574 --> 52:37.614
Tell me about yourself if you dare

52:37.775 --> 52:41.375
Give me a free choice
And a heart I can touch

52:41.534 --> 52:44.654
Give a chance
By speaking before you go

52:44.815 --> 52:48.775
What's left unsaid
Doesn't stand a chance

52:48.935 --> 52:55.094
Call it love
Call it whatever you want

52:57.455 --> 53:02.255
No words exist
That are quite good enough

53:02.415 --> 53:05.855
So call it whatever you want

53:06.895 --> 53:09.574
The two of us
Can survive almost anything

53:09.735 --> 53:13.215
Except the things
That were left unsaid

53:13.375 --> 53:20.054
Don't hold me hostage, take all of me
I need to be naked to love

53:20.214 --> 53:24.214
The dream that remains a dream
Is a lie

53:24.375 --> 53:30.614
Call it love
Call it whatever you want

53:32.855 --> 53:37.815
No words exist
That are quite good enough

53:37.975 --> 53:41.534
So call it whatever you want

53:43.574 --> 53:47.574
- They're making out!
- What a crying shame.

53:47.735 --> 53:51.015
Lovebirds! Get a room.

53:51.174 --> 53:57.014
- What's up, Michael?
- Musse? This is the shit, Musse!

53:57.174 --> 54:00.174
- How did you fix it?
- It was just the wires...

54:00.335 --> 54:06.615
I have to be by myself
But I still want you

54:06.775 --> 54:10.014
I want a gift
No bargain, no debt

54:10.174 --> 54:13.534
It's too easy
To switch from love to hate

54:13.694 --> 54:17.174
Let's try to keep them apart

54:17.335 --> 54:23.574
Call it love
Call it whatever you want

54:26.174 --> 54:31.094
No words exist
That are quite good enough

54:31.255 --> 54:35.215
So call it whatever you want

54:35.375 --> 54:42.335
Call it love.
Call it whatever you want.

01:00:56.815 --> 01:01:01.534
He's saying that he thinks
you're a bit.... You're a bit...

01:01:01.694 --> 01:01:05.094
Are you serious about this guy?

01:01:05.134 --> 01:01:11.455
- He's saying I do get a lot of pussy.
- This is getting cozier and cozier.

01:01:16.534 --> 01:01:20.534
- Where did you meet the blond guy?
- In the ice cream shop.

01:01:20.694 --> 01:01:24.574
- How many times have you met?
- Once or twice.

01:01:24.735 --> 01:01:27.655
Once? Twice? Get your story straight.

01:01:27.815 --> 01:01:33.855
Did you get his number?
How did you know he was on that boat?

01:01:46.614 --> 01:01:49.534
Is that him?

01:01:49.694 --> 01:01:54.975
- Tomas? Yes.
- "Yes. Tomas. Yes."

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.214
Come over here.

01:08:24.174 --> 01:08:26.734
Stand there.

01:08:29.334 --> 01:08:32.214
- Take off your panties.
- Now?

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:35.094
Yes, now. What do you think?

01:10:15.895 --> 01:10:18.655
What a fucking homo.

01:11:44.054 --> 01:11:46.575
Tomas?

01:15:01.054 --> 01:15:05.214
I want to marry this girl. She
can put naughty photos in my lunch box.

01:15:05.374 --> 01:15:09.174
You shouldn't marry a girl like that.

01:15:09.334 --> 01:15:15.054
Why are you saying this, bro?
She is exactly the woman to marry.

01:15:15.214 --> 01:15:18.254
Why does God reward
a prisoner with such pictures?

01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:25.014
It's not about God. If you rob a bank,
you can have the girls on your tail too.

01:15:25.174 --> 01:15:30.494
- It's not too late for a career change.
- I'm still thinking about it.

01:15:30.655 --> 01:15:33.735
But don't forget, it's our duty to...

01:15:38.174 --> 01:15:41.054
Good evening. How may I help you?

01:16:29.535 --> 01:16:33.335
- What was that?
- Did you see her naked feet?

01:16:33.495 --> 01:16:38.735
Should we arrest her because
she's barefoot on a summer's day?

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:42.455
- Right.
- I think she was high.

01:18:35.094 --> 01:18:38.655
It's disgusting. Move this.

01:18:43.334 --> 01:18:45.614
What's happening?

01:18:46.775 --> 01:18:49.815
Karsten, have you wrung this?

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:54.094
Have you wrung it?
There's blood everywhere.

01:18:54.254 --> 01:18:58.614
Damn it. Give me that bag.
Give it to me.

01:19:03.214 --> 01:19:06.334
We have to finish this!

01:20:29.294 --> 01:20:34.054
What's up, bathing beauties?
You look wonderful.

01:20:34.214 --> 01:20:38.614
- Come on, Michael.
- Daddy here's coming.

01:20:38.775 --> 01:20:42.054
- But I'm the dealer.
- Ready?

01:20:42.214 --> 01:20:44.614
- It ought to be an advantage.
- A three double somersault.

01:20:44.775 --> 01:20:50.214
- You turn it in a while.
- Okay. Was it 200?

01:20:51.294 --> 01:20:53.895
Bo, I need some space.

01:20:54.054 --> 01:20:58.494
- You coming or what?
- Of course. I'll do my dive.

01:20:58.655 --> 01:21:02.655
- Come on, boss!
- Is that a swimming ring, Bo?

01:21:02.815 --> 01:21:05.855
Come on, Michael.

01:21:06.014 --> 01:21:10.014
- What a guy!
- Cool.

01:21:14.735 --> 01:21:18.335
You look really great
in those trunks, Bo.

01:21:22.174 --> 01:21:25.254
- What's up, princess?
- Not a lot.
