WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:02.491
- Previously on Being Human.

00:02.530 --> 00:04.464
- (Both): Oh! Sorry!

00:04.500 --> 00:05.422
- Do you work here?

00:05.470 --> 00:06.540
- I'm trying.

00:06.570 --> 00:07.890
I'm applying
for my residency.

00:09.570 --> 00:10.230
Last call.

00:11.140 --> 00:12.938
- How is it
you get stuck minding

00:12.980 --> 00:14.505
'the errant
princess again?

00:14.540 --> 00:17.669
- I will work for you,
but I could never be like you.

00:17.710 --> 00:20.680
- This force
comes rushing out.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.087
(Screaming)

00:23.120 --> 00:24.747
I think it
actually flew out.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.509
(Screaming)

00:27.560 --> 00:29.016
(Growling)

00:29.060 --> 00:30.926
- Hegeman.
- Nora's wolf killed him.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.850
Do you remember anything
about being a wolf?

00:33.900 --> 00:36.096
- Should I?
- I'm not going to med school.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.359
I need to fix this.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.198
I need to try
and fix this for you.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.874
One thing monsters
and humans have in common

00:46.910 --> 00:49.948
is the fact that they're
both capable of destruction.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.540
We all leave a ton
of carnage in our wake.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.242
- You want me
to change in here?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.487
- Yeah.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.915
Or--or the one next door.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.849
I rented, uh,
both units.

01:04.690 --> 01:08.627
So there's this one too.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.630
Sally will lock us up
tomorrow night

01:11.670 --> 01:13.035
and before we change.

01:13.070 --> 01:15.164
And we'll wolf
out together,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.238
but separately,
safe and sound.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.580
- And you're OK
doing this?

01:20.610 --> 01:22.544
- She doesn't have a life.
- Hurtful.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.139
- Yes, but untrue?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.911
I'll--T'll build
us something

01:26.950 --> 01:29.647
so that we can lock
ourselves up next time.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.509
Because, as we all know,

01:30.550 --> 01:33.485
for the wolf,
convenience...

01:34.320 --> 01:35.583
is key.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.758
(Clearing throat)

01:36.790 --> 01:38.849
- Are you sure that
we have to do this?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.052
We already changed
together once

01:41.100 --> 01:43.967
and we're alive
to tell the tale.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.593
(Growling)

01:46.370 --> 01:48.338
- It's for the best.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.668
- But this is only
my 2nd time.

01:50.710 --> 01:55.705
I'm still trying to make sense
of what this is, what I am now.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.074
And I don't know
if this makes sense.

01:59.110 --> 02:02.239
- Well, it's not
just about safety.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.941
It's about, uh,
research too.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.988
- Hello, 1993.

02:10.289 --> 02:12.998
Why don't I give
you kids a minute?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.129
- So you're seriously
gonna tape us?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.969
- When this first
happened to me,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.935
all I could think
about was finding a cure.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.064
And then I met Aidan
and we launched into

02:26.110 --> 02:27.908
this whole let's-pretend-
to-be-human thing

02:27.940 --> 02:31.774
and I forgot that
I wanted to fix this,

02:31.810 --> 02:35.075
that I wanted to
actually be human again.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.612
And when I scratched
you, when I--

02:39.690 --> 02:41.658
When I did
this to you--

02:43.760 --> 02:45.250
- OK.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.722
- OK?

02:49.800 --> 02:53.338
- I will let a ghost lock me
in a storage unit

02:53.370 --> 02:54.997
so that you can videotape me

02:55.040 --> 02:58.704
while I take my clothes off
and turn into an animal.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.102
Yeah, that sounded as creepy
as I thought it would.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.743
(Sighing)

03:10.950 --> 03:13.453
- (Josh): The difference is
that a human feels bad

03:13.490 --> 03:16.187
about the pain they cause.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.757
They want to repair the damage,
put a Band-aid on it.

03:21.060 --> 03:22.789
It might not be that easy.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.322
The quick fix
doesn't always work.

03:31.070 --> 03:35.177
Once you've opened some doors,
you can never close them again.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.710
(Exhaling)

03:50.190 --> 03:51.783
(Birds chirping)

04:03.470 --> 04:06.007
- What's with
the sleep-peeping?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.031
- I was not...

04:09.040 --> 04:11.179
sleep-peeping.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.177
Is that--

04:12.210 --> 04:13.348
(Both chuckling)

04:14.420 --> 04:15.376
(Sighing)

04:15.420 --> 04:17.286
What?

04:17.320 --> 04:20.255
- Um, my ex used
to watch me sleep.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.452
Thought it was sweet,

04:22.490 --> 04:26.290
until he turned out
to be dead inside.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.969
(Laughing):
I'm sorry.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.970
- That's OK. We all have
bad breakups behind us.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.401
So, tomorrow is
someone's big first day.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.576
Are you nervous?

04:45.180 --> 04:47.217
(Sighing)

04:48.480 --> 04:49.242
(Laughing)

04:49.280 --> 04:52.511
- Yes, you are!
You're nervous.

04:52.560 --> 04:56.019
- Is it going to be
weird working together?

04:56.060 --> 04:58.529
- Well, in a big maze
like City Hospital,

04:58.560 --> 05:00.494
we'll probably never
see each other.

05:00.530 --> 05:02.419
- Hmm...

05:02.470 --> 05:06.498
It's just that we're having
a good time with this.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.237
I don't wanna
screw it up.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.432
- Can I, uh,
can I say something?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.471
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.000
- I am...

05:18.450 --> 05:20.145
kind of looking forward

05:20.180 --> 05:22.410
to running into
you in the halls.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.679
(Chuckles)

05:23.720 --> 05:27.418
- You do realize that if we run
into each other in the hallways,

05:27.460 --> 05:31.351
it'll be because we're trying to
stop someone from bleeding out.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.357
- That's right.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.050
- Yeah.

05:36.430 --> 05:39.229
- (Josh): A monster, a real
monster, doesn't give a damn

05:39.270 --> 05:43.207
about the havoc it wreaks,
the blood it spills.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.937
- Hey, you know,
I'm gonna get something.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.278
- Hurry up.

05:47.310 --> 05:48.209
- The hardest thing

05:48.240 --> 05:49.378
about knowing you're capable

05:49.410 --> 05:52.107
of inflicting pain, death even,

05:52.150 --> 05:55.541
is constantly trying to avoid
doing such a thing,

05:55.580 --> 05:58.550
especially when every fibre
of your being

05:58.590 --> 06:01.150
wants to hurt and consume

06:01.190 --> 06:03.921
everyone it comes
into contact with.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.497
(Groaning)

06:10.500 --> 06:11.820
(Teeth clicking)

06:12.640 --> 06:14.369
(Exhales)

06:17.470 --> 06:19.302
- Are you OK?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.075
- I'm good!

06:35.520 --> 06:37.454
(Siren in distance)

06:37.490 --> 06:39.549
- I just don't
think it's right,

06:39.600 --> 06:40.920
you putting her
in storage.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.270
- I'm not leaving her
in a well.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.359
And I'm getting
locked up too, remember?

06:46.940 --> 06:47.930
- Well, well, well!

06:47.970 --> 06:50.405
Nice to see you
among us day walkers.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.603
- And what did
Princess Suren--

06:53.640 --> 06:55.472
I love saying that,
by the way--

06:55.510 --> 06:58.548
Have you doing that you were
a half hour late for your shift?

06:58.580 --> 07:00.218
- I know I haven't been
around a lot lately,

07:00.250 --> 07:02.617
but my life isn't
just about the...

07:02.650 --> 07:03.617
- Princess Suren.

07:03.650 --> 07:04.640
- Nice.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.886
- I have other stuff
going on.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.410
- Other--
What other stuff?

07:08.460 --> 07:10.986
- Ha! Are you doing this
other stuff with another person,

07:11.030 --> 07:13.453
and if so, is that
person female?

07:13.500 --> 07:17.164
And if so, are you doing that
other stuff with her "vagua".

07:17.200 --> 07:18.292
- Uh...

07:18.330 --> 07:19.297
(Chuckling)

07:19.330 --> 07:22.436
OK, OK.
I am seeing someone.

07:22.470 --> 07:23.540
It is a woman,

07:23.570 --> 07:25.060
and she has a pulse.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.499
- Sweet!
- Are we sure this a good idea?

07:27.540 --> 07:28.610
- Why you gotta be a jerk?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.005
-It'sa
valid question.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.540
I'm not trying to
be a wet blanket,

07:31.580 --> 07:33.378
but the last person
you dated was Rebecca.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.979
- I know.
Thank you very much.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.079
- Well, and that ended badly...
With death, with lots of death.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.579
- It won't be like that
this time because...

07:40.620 --> 07:42.258
I have more control now.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.782
- OK, when do we get
to meet her or when does

07:44.830 --> 07:46.059
Josh get to meet her

07:46.090 --> 07:48.696
and I get to stand there
and judge her silently?

07:48.730 --> 07:50.664
- OK, I don't know if
we're at that point yet.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.432
- Ah, so what point are you at?
You're at a point.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.529
- We hang out, we enjoy
each other's company

07:56.570 --> 07:58.129
and then we go
back to our lives.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.434
It's easy, it's casual,
and above all else,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.778
it's normal, and that is
what I need right now.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.177
- When you say
"enjoying each other's company,"

08:05.210 --> 08:07.474
that's code for
"tapping that ass,"

08:07.520 --> 08:08.817
yes, to be clear?

08:08.850 --> 08:10.614
- You are a
classy lady.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.585
- We've all been
through a lot this past year.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.088
If you've got yourself
under control,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.827
why shouldn't you get
a shot at happiness?

08:16.860 --> 08:17.884
- Well, thank you.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.182
- Yes, I approve.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.221
- And I didn't ask
for your approval.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.022
- But you wanted it.

08:22.060 --> 08:22.891
- No, I don't want it.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.091
- It's written
all over your face.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.200
- Leave me alone!

08:28.470 --> 08:30.165
(Cooing)

08:32.780 --> 08:34.475
- You, out.

08:34.510 --> 08:37.639
- Nurse ghost? Cute.
Your shift's over, sweetie.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.410
- I'm not dead yet.
Now go.

08:40.450 --> 08:43.090
No unauthorized
ghosts in the nursery.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.487
- You're not dead and
you're talking to me?

08:45.520 --> 08:48.217
You can see me?
How can you see me?

08:48.260 --> 08:49.659
- Second sight,
6th sense.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.226
It's a gift.
It's a curse.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.489
Crazy stuff.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.259
Now get in line
with the others.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.324
- Uh, I'm not...

08:55.360 --> 08:57.590
- Line. Now!

09:11.410 --> 09:12.844
(Beeping)

09:15.180 --> 09:16.739
(Beeping)

09:21.590 --> 09:24.127
- Hey, Terry. Could I
use your key card?

09:24.160 --> 09:26.754
- It won't work either,
They've tightened security.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.689
Only shift supervisor
can get in the supply.

09:28.730 --> 09:29.959
- Why?
- They think some idiot

09:30.000 --> 09:33.061
has been selling blood to
junkies for drug tests.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.432
Administration's got a bug
way up their ass about it.

09:35.470 --> 09:36.631
Sorry.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.401
(Crying)

09:46.450 --> 09:49.112
- What kind of power trip
is that nurse on?

09:49.150 --> 09:50.811
We're ghosts. We can
go wherever we want.

09:50.850 --> 09:51.885
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.810
You do not want to piss off
the reincarnation chick.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.919
- The reincarnation chick?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.689
- Yeah, Zoe Gonzalez!

09:58.730 --> 10:02.769
If she thinks you're worthy,
she can get you reincarnated.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.019
- Like Buddha style?

10:05.070 --> 10:07.164
- Yeah! A couple
years back,

10:07.200 --> 10:09.862
my cousin Joey turned into
a Korean girl named Nancy.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.402
- So why are we waiting
in line? Let's just do it.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.137
- No, no, no. Zoe salts
the nursery door.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.000
She even comes in
on her days off

10:17.050 --> 10:19.974
to lay the stuff down
to keep the nutty ghosts out.

10:20.020 --> 10:20.839
I mean, even if
she didn't,

10:20.880 --> 10:22.939
you can't just jump
into any kid.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.812
It's gotta be the right one,
one of the sickly ones.

10:25.850 --> 10:28.285
Your energy has to
meet with their energy,

10:28.320 --> 10:30.288
giving them that boost
they need, you know,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.992
that life force
to stay alive.

10:33.030 --> 10:35.397
Besides, people like us,
it freaks them out.

10:35.430 --> 10:39.219
You need Zoe to help them
accept our spirit.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.331
That's why she gets to say
who goes in and who doesn't.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.259
She's a little bit
of a picky hard-ass,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.108
so I'd watch out
if I was you.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.101
(Baby cooing)

10:55.550 --> 10:57.143
(Grunting)

10:57.190 --> 11:00.387
- Mmm! I love
your room.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.387
You want a tour?

11:01.420 --> 11:03.229
- Maybe in
the morning.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.280
- One second,
one second.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.957
I forgot something.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.561
- I, um, OK. I forgot
that I got something for you.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.092
It's for tomorrow.
It is vintage.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.131
- Mm-hmm?
- Tt--

11:17.240 --> 11:18.207
(Laughing)

11:18.240 --> 11:19.833
What? You know, I thought

11:19.880 --> 11:21.200
you could kick it
old school

11:21.240 --> 11:22.435
and bring it
back into style.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.278
- Wow!
- Yeah.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.448
Oh, wow! Yeah.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.379
- Yeah?

11:26.410 --> 11:27.411
- Wait, wait.

11:27.450 --> 11:28.770
Oh, yeah.
That's sexy.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.140
** We got ways

11:30.190 --> 11:33.114
* Of getting people to talk

11:33.160 --> 11:37.154
* I adore that you're
not easily shocked

11:37.190 --> 11:41.093
* And you swear that
you have not been stalked

11:41.130 --> 11:42.768
* But you are

11:44.270 --> 11:45.829
* Oh yes, you are

11:45.870 --> 11:47.167
(Both moaning)

11:47.200 --> 11:48.429
* Oh yes, you are...

11:48.470 --> 11:50.802
Could you just
give me a second?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.537
- Now where are you going?
- Kitchen.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.173
- You keep condoms
in the kitchen?

11:55.210 --> 11:56.371
That's just inefficient.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.504
- I'm getting us
some water, smart-ass!

11:58.550 --> 11:59.210
- Water.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.476
(Scoffing)

12:01.520 --> 12:03.079
* And you'd love to just

12:03.120 --> 12:05.214
* Get rid of me

12:05.250 --> 12:07.389
* But that is not my problem

12:07.420 --> 12:09.457
(Exhaling sharply)

12:09.490 --> 12:11.549
* 'Cause I love you...

12:11.590 --> 12:12.557
(Groaning)

12:12.590 --> 12:13.955
- Please use a glass.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.422
- I'm sorry.
Kind of in a hurry.

12:17.130 --> 12:22.637
- Aidan, was that
a feminine voice

12:22.670 --> 12:23.899
that I heard up
in your room?

12:23.940 --> 12:26.409
'Cause I was kind of
hoping it wasn't you.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.275
Is that your
casual lady?

12:29.310 --> 12:31.574
- You're not
calling her that.

12:31.610 --> 12:34.875
- Hey, wait. Is that how
you're controlling your urges?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.410
- It's a working
hypothesis, Josh.

12:36.450 --> 12:37.918
- It seems very
risky to me.

12:37.950 --> 12:38.917
- Could you kill
someone else's mood

12:38.950 --> 12:39.815
and let me enjoy this?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.214
This is my last bag!

12:43.190 --> 12:44.555
- All right.

12:44.590 --> 12:45.887
(Slurping)

12:45.930 --> 12:47.159
(Chuckles)

12:47.200 --> 12:48.326
Look at--
Look at us!

12:48.360 --> 12:51.990
We're just 2 dudes
standing in their kitchen

12:52.030 --> 12:55.637
having a chat before
bedding down their women.

12:55.670 --> 12:59.038
- Ah! Yeah, we're
living the dream.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.902
(Groaning)

13:02.040 --> 13:03.041
- That's disgusting.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.172
* I'm stalking you

13:04.210 --> 13:05.280
Hey!

13:05.310 --> 13:06.380
* Yes, I'm stalking you

13:06.410 --> 13:08.276
* I'm stalking you...

13:08.320 --> 13:09.947
- What's that?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.310
(Muttering)

13:11.350 --> 13:14.354
- I'm sorry.
That's... "douche-y".

13:14.390 --> 13:17.189
* Yes, I'm stalking you
I'm stalking you *

13:17.230 --> 13:18.459
(Siren in distance)

13:18.490 --> 13:20.356
- Are you
coming to bed?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.095
- Yeah, in a minute.

13:22.130 --> 13:25.464
I gotta find a way to make
this camera werewolf proof.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.524
(Inhaling)

13:27.800 --> 13:31.100
- Have you been
eating oregano?

13:31.140 --> 13:32.107
(Chuckling)

13:32.140 --> 13:36.099
- I, uh, I had
some spaghetti...

13:36.140 --> 13:38.245
like, 4 days ago.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.250
- Ugh! You reek
of the stuff.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.247
(Sighing)

13:42.280 --> 13:44.590
- Yeah, that's
your sense of smell.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.282
It gets cranked up
the day before the change.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.288
I've been enjoying
your stank all day.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.355
(Chuckling)

13:51.960 --> 13:53.098
Go to the window.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.438
(Dog barking in distance)

14:04.170 --> 14:05.399
What do you smell?

14:06.440 --> 14:08.272
(Inhaling)

14:09.180 --> 14:10.477
- I smell...

14:11.510 --> 14:13.217
tomatoes.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.979
- Yeah, Mrs. Emerson
grows those

14:15.020 --> 14:17.114
in her backyard
across the street.

14:17.150 --> 14:18.117
(Chuckles)

14:18.150 --> 14:19.413
(Inhaling)

14:19.450 --> 14:21.282
- Cigar smoke.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.028
- That's the old bartender
at Fletcher's Pub

14:24.060 --> 14:25.289
out for a
smoke break.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.264
Can you smell
the sugar refinery?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.189
(Inhaling)

14:34.240 --> 14:36.060
- I smell it.

14:39.370 --> 14:42.237
It's actually
kind of gross.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.247
- Gross, yeah.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.475
(Thudding and
woman moaning)

14:44.510 --> 14:46.376
- And I can hear...

14:48.580 --> 14:49.945
Whoa!

14:51.050 --> 14:53.553
I can hear
somebody having sex.

14:53.590 --> 14:58.152
And they are really
going to town!

14:58.190 --> 15:02.024
- Yeah, well, you don't
really need super hearing

15:02.060 --> 15:03.528
for that one.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.892
- Oh my!
Is that Aidan?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.089
- Yeah.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.633
I didn't know the
walls were so thin.

15:11.670 --> 15:14.105
- Well, maybe we should give
them a run for their money.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.608
- Yeah, you're just, um...

15:15.640 --> 15:19.247
That's--that's the wolf feeling.
You're very wolfy right now.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.577
- Well, so what?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.179
You're feeling wolfy too.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.746
- I should finish
this first.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.542
- Now.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.217
- OK! Yeah,
let's sex it now.

15:28.260 --> 15:28.886
(Squeals)

15:29.590 --> 15:31.183
** But you can't seem

15:31.230 --> 15:33.722
* To find your heart *

15:33.760 --> 15:35.797
- Hey, so what was with

15:35.830 --> 15:37.662
the bang-off I had
to listen to last night?

15:37.700 --> 15:39.395
I'm the
ghost, people.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.137
I'm the one who makes
creepy noises

15:41.170 --> 15:42.194
in the middle of the night.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.607
- I love eggs!

15:44.640 --> 15:45.732
- Whatever!

15:45.770 --> 15:48.637
You guys can start swinging
naked from the chandelier.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.205
I'm moving out.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.706
- Where you going?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.639
- I've decided to
be reincarnated.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.648
(Laughing, clearing throat)

15:55.680 --> 15:58.240
- Sally's decided
to be reincarnated.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.258
- Hmm? Oh!
Hilarious.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.315
- I'm not seeing
the humor in this situation.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.227
- What's funny about it is
that reincarnation isn't real.

16:05.260 --> 16:06.330
And even if it were,

16:06.360 --> 16:08.692
you would be way too chicken
to go through with it.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.892
- It is real and it happens

16:10.930 --> 16:12.864
right under your noses
at the hospital.

16:12.900 --> 16:16.063
And I'm gonna do it, so I'd
appreciate some support here.

16:16.100 --> 16:16.965
- Sally, calm down.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.865
- Whoa, okay listen we got
company upstairs

16:18.910 --> 16:21.299
so please put a lid
on this stuff.

16:21.340 --> 16:22.239
- Wait, there's company?

16:22.280 --> 16:24.544
Your girl
is still here?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.708
I would've made
more frittata!

16:35.220 --> 16:36.710
- Josh?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.320
- (Whispering): Julia.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.698
- Oh, wait. Ho--
You're--you're that Julia?

16:44.730 --> 16:47.529
His Ju--
Julia the fianc!

16:47.570 --> 16:49.834
- I'm not his.
He, uh...

16:50.840 --> 16:52.638
He left me.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.079
- Julia!

17:05.119 --> 17:06.609
Julia, wait.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.755
Stop for a
second, please.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.627
I don't know
what to say.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.492
I'm sorry for
back there, I...

17:18.930 --> 17:24.107
<i>- couldn't believe
it was you in my house.</i>

17:26.569 --> 17:28.470
What are you
doing in Boston?

17:28.510 --> 17:32.902
- I got my
residency at SCH.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.714
- The hospital?
My hospital?

17:34.750 --> 17:38.345
The one that
I work at with Aidan?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.710
(Scoffing)

17:39.750 --> 17:42.720
- Did you know?
- God, no!

17:42.760 --> 17:47.823
Please don't make this any
more awkward and awful for me.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.589
(Sighing)

17:49.630 --> 17:51.394
- I'm sorry, Julia...

17:54.740 --> 17:56.697
for leaving you
the way I did.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.605
- You ran away!

18:02.640 --> 18:04.677
- I did.
I ran away.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.839
And I wish I had an explanation
that you would believe,

18:07.880 --> 18:10.713
but believe me when
I say it was for the best.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.553
Wait. Don't, plea--

18:17.590 --> 18:19.149
- No.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.329
(Sighing)

18:39.510 --> 18:41.717
(Crying)

18:54.430 --> 18:55.750
- Aw, salt.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.197
(Crying)

19:00.240 --> 19:03.266
Seriously? That guy?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.733
** Wish me luck
one more time

19:06.770 --> 19:08.670
(Whispering,
indistinct)

19:08.710 --> 19:11.645
* I've got a new
frame of mind

19:13.380 --> 19:18.614
* Run off to Brooklyn
or run off to Spain

19:18.650 --> 19:24.350
* And make sure to tell
everyone how they've changed

19:24.390 --> 19:27.928
* Now that the view is
all clear from the bow

19:27.960 --> 19:32.625
* Now that the roads have
been built through the town

19:32.670 --> 19:37.335
* How many throats
will be cut till I see

19:37.370 --> 19:41.876
* What is beyond the breech? *

19:43.080 --> 19:44.775
(Exhales sharply)

19:52.350 --> 19:54.887
- Do you have any idea how
delicate a procedure that is?

19:54.920 --> 19:57.480
Any notion what it takes
to coax a newborn spirit

19:57.530 --> 19:59.680
into accepting
someone else?

19:59.730 --> 20:02.256
- I'm sorry.
I didn't-- I didn't know.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.596
You're kind of
amazing, by the way.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.497
How are you
able to do that?

20:09.640 --> 20:11.563
- I was a baby.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.738
A ghost came to me.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.932
He was terrifying, but when
he started to possess me,

20:16.980 --> 20:18.903
I screamed so loud,
I scared him.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.715
I often think I have
a piece of him in me

20:21.750 --> 20:23.741
and that's why
I'm able to see them.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.485
(Siren in distance)

20:25.520 --> 20:26.840
That's my first memory.

20:27.690 --> 20:30.352
- My first memory
was burning my lap

20:30.390 --> 20:32.449
with a bowl
of SpaghettiOs.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.819
- So why should I help
you be reincarnated?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.090
- Because I have a lot
of awesome qualities

20:38.130 --> 20:39.620
that could really
help a baby out.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.492
I was a decent person
before I died, you know?

20:42.540 --> 20:44.099
I came from
a good family,

20:44.140 --> 20:45.266
a loving home.

20:45.310 --> 20:48.371
- Osama bin Laden came from
a loving home. Means zero.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.640
- I'm trying to paint
a portrait of myself for you.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.909
- If you're
a good person,

20:51.950 --> 20:53.975
you should just
wait on your door.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.012
- Yeah, I kind of passed
my door up.

20:57.050 --> 20:59.644
- You passed up
your door?

20:59.690 --> 21:03.456
- I had to in order
to help my roommate.

21:04.490 --> 21:05.719
I'm selfless like that.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.752
- Hold up.
You have roommates?

21:23.710 --> 21:24.973
(Sighing)

21:25.010 --> 21:28.674
- I, uh, met Julia,

21:28.720 --> 21:31.143
um, in a bar.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.511
- Julia doesn't go into bars.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.949
- OK, uh,
but she does now, so...

21:35.990 --> 21:39.858
- OK. OK, and so what
were you doing at the bar?

21:39.890 --> 21:41.449
What were you
gonna drink?

21:42.530 --> 21:43.998
- You know, I don't
appreciate that.

21:44.030 --> 21:47.591
- Right, because you're in
control of your urges now?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.961
Were you in control
when you met Julia?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.231
- I was tempted at first, yes,
but I haven't hurt her.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.078
I didn't hurt her.

21:54.110 --> 21:55.032
- Yet.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.401
- (Chuckling):
Oh God!

21:57.450 --> 21:59.669
- Yeah, and how's your
little hypothesis working

21:59.710 --> 22:01.712
now that you're cut off?

22:01.750 --> 22:02.842
- You remember when you
were happy for me?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.314
You said I deserved
something normal?

22:04.350 --> 22:05.818
- Right yeah, I remember that.

22:05.850 --> 22:08.182
I'm so happy that
you're sleeping with my ex

22:08.220 --> 22:09.255
and not eating her.

22:09.290 --> 22:11.930
- I didn't know
who she was, Josh.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.052
- Are you gonna--

22:16.100 --> 22:17.499
Are you gonna
keep seeing her?

22:17.530 --> 22:18.167
- Of course not!

22:19.470 --> 22:24.032
Believe it or not, Josh, this
was never a design to hurt you.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.010
(Sighing)

22:36.580 --> 22:37.843
- How is she?

22:37.890 --> 22:39.619
(Exhaling sharply)

22:41.690 --> 22:44.159
- Honestly, uh...

22:44.190 --> 22:47.558
I think you did
a number on her.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.955
I think-- She hasn't
said anything,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.991
but there are moments

22:52.030 --> 22:55.432
where you can see
the scar tissue.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.677
- But she--

23:01.710 --> 23:03.940
She bounced
back, right?

23:04.950 --> 23:07.840
I mean,
she's a doctor now.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.110
I always knew she'd be
a great doctor.

23:10.150 --> 23:11.982
(Sniffling)

23:13.090 --> 23:14.683
This is better.
She's better.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.687
She's better now.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.688
- OK, Dawson, Pacey,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.653
forget about Joey
and get your A-games on.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.452
- What's going on?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.899
- The reincarnation
lady is coming

23:21.930 --> 23:23.728
to interview you
about me and make sure

23:23.770 --> 23:25.568
that I'm good to mingle
with a baby soul.

23:27.570 --> 23:31.268
- Did--did you even hear
what you just said?

23:31.310 --> 23:33.165
- I've seen it happen!

23:33.210 --> 23:35.178
It's real and I'm doing it.

23:36.880 --> 23:40.748
I was 23 when I died.
I barely got out of the gate.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.420
I watched you and Nora together
at the storage unit yesterday,

23:43.450 --> 23:44.349
so in love.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.484
That's all I can do now.
I'm an observer.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.887
That's all
I will ever be.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.787
And now I have a shot
to live again.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.696
Don't I deserve that?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.598
(Door buzzing)

24:00.640 --> 24:02.699
(Sighing)

24:02.740 --> 24:06.802
Boys, always be selling.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.808
Get the door.

24:13.580 --> 24:17.244
- Would you like some, uh,
coffee or something? Soda?

24:17.280 --> 24:18.418
- Soda Kills.

24:18.450 --> 24:23.650
- It's so weird that we've
never hung out before this.

24:25.130 --> 24:29.897
- So, um, you wanna
talk to us about Sally?

24:29.930 --> 24:31.796
- I wanted to meet
people like you.

24:31.830 --> 24:35.767
- She means people like her,
ordinary human beings who,

24:35.800 --> 24:38.770
for whatever reason,
can speak to the dead.

24:39.810 --> 24:40.777
- Right.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.130
- Mm-hmm.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.842
- Right. It's cr--
It's nuts, isn't it,

24:44.880 --> 24:48.817
how everything else about you
can be so normal, but this--

24:48.850 --> 24:49.976
But there's this one...

24:50.020 --> 24:50.714
(Chuckling)

24:50.750 --> 24:52.548
...this one thing, right?

24:52.590 --> 24:53.386
Right?

24:54.460 --> 24:56.656
- Oh, it's crazy train.
- OK. Good.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.749
Now that we've bonded,
maybe we should

24:58.790 --> 25:00.224
get this interview rolling.

25:00.260 --> 25:01.557
- Not with you here.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.762
- What?
Come on, let's go.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.120
- Get out.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.195
- You know, it's fine.

25:07.230 --> 25:08.197
We get it.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.331
- Fine.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.408
(Pen clicking)

25:16.440 --> 25:17.601
- Let's begin.

25:26.050 --> 25:27.984
(Sighing)

25:30.060 --> 25:31.357
- How'd it go?

25:31.390 --> 25:32.687
- I can't help you.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.695
- What did those
morons say to you?

25:37.730 --> 25:39.664
- Your roommates love you.
They tried.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.340
- They blew it! Come on, give me
a chance to defend myself.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.963
- It's not what
they told me.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.068
It's what you
didn't tell me,

25:45.110 --> 25:47.875
about your fianc, how you
almost slit his throat.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.332
- Almost! I didn't,
and isn't that

25:49.380 --> 25:50.779
what we should focus on?

25:50.810 --> 25:53.507
Look, he killed me and
then tried to exorcize me.

25:53.550 --> 25:54.620
I was angry.

25:54.650 --> 25:57.312
- You don't have any of
that left? There's no anger?

25:58.650 --> 26:01.813
In my experience, a dishonest
ghost is a damaged ghost.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.316
I can't work with
a damaged ghost.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.055
- Oh, please, please!
You don't understand.

26:05.090 --> 26:06.080
I have to get away.

26:06.130 --> 26:08.224
- You have a house,
friends who care about you.

26:08.260 --> 26:10.490
Trust me, you've got it better
than any ghost I've met.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.432
- I've been seeing
things lately.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.331
There's something after me.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.475
(Screaming)

26:21.510 --> 26:25.344
Something dark that
I let loose into my world.

26:25.380 --> 26:27.542
I keep seeing it.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.344
It's hunting me.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.584
It's toying with me.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.456
- Let's say this is true,

26:34.490 --> 26:36.288
and there is
something after you,

26:36.320 --> 26:38.129
what's to stop it
from coming after you

26:38.160 --> 26:39.150
even if I do help you?

26:39.190 --> 26:41.124
Because then, Sally,
you're an infant

26:42.100 --> 26:43.352
and you're defenceless.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.289
(Siren in distance)

26:46.130 --> 26:47.063
I really am...

26:47.100 --> 26:47.931
(Whooshing)

26:51.210 --> 26:53.065
Sorry.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.975
- (Woman on PA): Dr. Chan,
please pick up line 5.

27:00.010 --> 27:01.876
Dr. Chan, line 5.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.382
- Are you lost?

27:04.420 --> 27:05.945
- What?

27:05.990 --> 27:08.857
No. Yes.

27:08.890 --> 27:10.210
Unit C?

27:10.260 --> 27:12.957
- Elevator to the 3rd floor,
make 2 lefts.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.220
- Thanks. I keep wondering
if this place is disorganized

27:15.260 --> 27:16.352
or I'm just stupid.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.549
- I've been here for years.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.125
I still get turned around.

27:20.100 --> 27:22.364
I'm Nora, by the way.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.529
- I know.
I asked around.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.008
So you and Josh.

27:30.310 --> 27:31.675
I don't mean to
be "blurty" like this,

27:31.710 --> 27:33.508
but apparently we're all
gonna be working together,

27:33.550 --> 27:35.541
so we should get
this out of the way.

27:35.580 --> 27:38.083
- We've been together
for a few months.

27:39.220 --> 27:42.485
He told me about what
happened between the 2 of you.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.820
- Then you have a better
handle on the situation,

27:45.860 --> 27:48.192
because I have no
idea what happened.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.494
- You should really talk
to Josh about this.

27:50.530 --> 27:51.122
- I'm stressed enough.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.296
I don't have it in me

27:52.330 --> 27:56.369
to listen to him stammer and
lie through an explanation.

27:56.400 --> 28:00.064
- He was in a bad place,
but he's different now.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.374
- Well, when I look at him,
I still see the same, old,

28:02.410 --> 28:05.971
selfish, cruel piece of
garbage who ran away.

28:06.010 --> 28:07.171
- It wasn't his fault.

28:07.210 --> 28:10.840
- Right, and you know because
he's actually spoken to you

28:10.890 --> 28:12.039
about what happened.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.015
I'm sorry.

28:15.060 --> 28:19.019
After this morning,
I'm still feeling a little raw.

28:20.590 --> 28:23.025
I believe you're
a nice person,

28:23.060 --> 28:24.960
but I know Josh
for what he is.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.119
It's just a matter of time

28:27.170 --> 28:29.161
before he does to you
what he did to me.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.399
- All right, sponge.
- Here you go.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.909
- How's the breathing?
- What happened to this guy?

28:36.940 --> 28:39.272
- G.S.W. to the chest. I need
some extra hands over here.

28:39.310 --> 28:40.448
Standby for the suction.
- All right,

28:40.480 --> 28:44.917
- What are our numbers?
- BP, 85 over 60. Pulse, 140.

28:44.950 --> 28:47.009
- OK, let's put
a chest tube in.

28:47.050 --> 28:50.088
- ** Please don't
give me everything... *

28:50.120 --> 28:52.782
I need suction over here.
Suction!

28:52.830 --> 28:54.889
The suction, now!

28:57.000 --> 28:59.025
(Slurping, grunting)

28:59.070 --> 29:00.595
- Ah!

29:01.700 --> 29:03.839
Mmm!

29:03.870 --> 29:06.100
Ah! What?

29:06.140 --> 29:08.006
(Gasps)

29:09.080 --> 29:10.775
(Sniffling)

29:10.810 --> 29:11.743
- You OK?

29:14.750 --> 29:16.411
- Yeah.

29:16.450 --> 29:17.645
(Grunting)

29:17.680 --> 29:22.151
I'm fine.
I just dozed off.

29:22.190 --> 29:23.828
- You look pale...

29:24.530 --> 29:25.850
even for you.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.149
And since when
do you nap?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.258
- I haven't eaten

29:30.300 --> 29:35.170
and the hospital put the supply
under lock and key.

29:35.200 --> 29:35.940
- OK.

29:36.940 --> 29:40.979
Well, what about, uh,
you know, those places

29:41.010 --> 29:42.978
where the weirdos let you
drink their blood?

29:43.010 --> 29:44.239
- Blood den. No.

29:44.280 --> 29:48.979
It would mean, uh,
drinking live and...

29:50.990 --> 29:53.118
Plus, if certain people
found out I was feeding there,

29:53.150 --> 29:55.551
they might take
advantage of that

29:55.590 --> 29:59.128
and that would be
very bad for everyone.

29:59.160 --> 29:59.979
(Sighing)

30:00.030 --> 30:02.954
- So you're going
cold turkey?

30:04.370 --> 30:06.168
- So it would appear.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.759
- Well, what
happens next?

30:10.910 --> 30:14.972
- Oh, what happens next
is I will get sick

30:15.010 --> 30:16.569
then the hunger
takes over,

30:17.610 --> 30:20.477
then you begin to act
on instinct and then...

30:22.920 --> 30:23.887
you binge.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.410
- OK...

30:26.820 --> 30:28.857
Let's define "binge".

30:28.890 --> 30:30.654
Am I[-- Am I
gonna come home

30:30.690 --> 30:33.022
and find bodies stacked
like firewood?

30:34.130 --> 30:37.020
And--and then what
happens after the binge?

30:37.060 --> 30:38.664
Are you--
are you OK?

30:38.700 --> 30:40.998
- Drinking live--

30:41.040 --> 30:43.168
Drinking live is different.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.361
It's harder to stop.

30:44.410 --> 30:49.769
It's impossible to control
and I will slip back, uh...

30:49.810 --> 30:51.209
to the way that
I was before,

30:51.250 --> 30:53.844
which not like this.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.017
- And before you were...

30:57.050 --> 30:59.439
- No one that you'd
ever want to meet.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.389
Hey...

31:02.420 --> 31:03.717
(Grunting)

31:04.430 --> 31:06.250
How'd it go with Zoe?

31:06.290 --> 31:07.485
- Don't change
the subject.

31:07.530 --> 31:09.555
- Oh, it's been changed.
How'd it go?

31:12.400 --> 31:14.994
Oh, we didn't
blow it for you, did we?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.997
- No, it was me.

31:17.970 --> 31:20.337
- You're gonna be OK.

31:20.370 --> 31:24.170
There's probably millions
of ways out of here.

31:24.210 --> 31:25.939
You'll find a way.

31:30.020 --> 31:33.081
(Siren in distance)

31:33.120 --> 31:35.316
(Baby crying)

31:46.500 --> 31:50.494
** And the ocean

31:50.540 --> 31:53.862
* Tide

31:54.880 --> 31:59.272
* Makes a picture of my life

32:01.220 --> 32:04.815
* As you

32:04.850 --> 32:08.354
* As you... *

32:08.390 --> 32:10.154
- Hey, there.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.658
What's your name?

32:13.630 --> 32:15.155
S. Russell.

32:15.730 --> 32:17.323
Well, hello, S. Russell.

32:18.470 --> 32:23.135
You're not freaked out by me
at all, are you, sweetie?

32:23.170 --> 32:23.932
(Cooing)

32:23.970 --> 32:25.335
Not even a little bit.

32:26.470 --> 32:30.008
You know you can
help me, don't you?

32:31.210 --> 32:33.577
You know I need
to be some place else.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.342
OK, sweetie.
Zoe's not here to help,

32:38.390 --> 32:41.257
but you're being
such a good baby,

32:41.290 --> 32:42.917
I think we're gonna be OK.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.428
(Crying)

32:44.460 --> 32:46.519
Oh, no.
Don't cry, baby.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.028
Don't cry.

32:48.060 --> 32:49.926
(Crying)

32:49.960 --> 32:51.564
Don't cry.
It's gonna be OK.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.920
(Crying)

32:54.400 --> 32:56.937
(Rumbling,
whispering)

33:02.440 --> 33:03.839
(Baby crying)

33:03.880 --> 33:05.302
Leave this baby alone.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.410
(Screaming)

33:08.450 --> 33:10.475
(Panting)

33:14.620 --> 33:16.088
- Are you
kidding me?

33:17.190 --> 33:19.329
You were gonna jump
into a baby weren't you?

33:20.990 --> 33:22.025
(Sighing)

33:22.060 --> 33:24.222
- You were right.
You'll never see me again.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.492
- Wait.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.465
Why didn't you?

33:35.480 --> 33:37.630
- Wouldn't have
been fair.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.705
It just would've
followed me.

33:39.750 --> 33:43.948
- This thing that's after you,
what's it look like?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.642
- Really?
- Yeah, whatever.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.715
My shift's up and
I have nothing else to do.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.525
So I can try to help you
while I drink alone.

33:52.990 --> 33:56.290
OK, well, my friend Stevie
told me that ghosts can sleep,

33:56.330 --> 33:57.491
so I had this dream.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.794
- OK, can you tell this to me
in a not-boring way?

34:01.670 --> 34:02.967
(Grunting)

34:06.210 --> 34:08.132
- Hey! Check this out.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.670
- I can't do this.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.199
I can't lock
myself up in here.

34:12.179 --> 34:15.411
- We have to. It's the
only way to be safe.

34:15.449 --> 34:17.942
- Well, maybe I don't
wanna be safe.

34:17.980 --> 34:20.415
Maybe I wanna be free.

34:21.290 --> 34:22.610
- Listen.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.752
You just need to stop
and think right now.

34:25.790 --> 34:26.928
This isn't you talking.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.688
- I don't care.
I don't care.

34:28.730 --> 34:32.063
Every cell in my body
is screaming at me

34:32.100 --> 34:33.498
to run out of here
and never look back.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.567
- That's the wolf.
You're anxious.

34:35.600 --> 34:39.036
You'll get used to it. You just
need to learn to fight it.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.264
- Yeah, but what if

34:40.310 --> 34:42.972
we change together
and our wolves are calm?

34:43.010 --> 34:44.375
Maybe they'll be
happy together.

34:44.409 --> 34:46.799
- This isn't a dog run
on the common.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.543
We can't take
that chance.

34:49.580 --> 34:52.641
- Well, only one of us
has to be locked up.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.714
I could go
to the woods.

34:53.750 --> 34:54.784
- Noora.

35:01.330 --> 35:02.456
You're a killer.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.036
I watched you tear
someone to shreds.

35:12.140 --> 35:14.472
You have no idea
the danger you put us in.

35:15.740 --> 35:16.832
- I know what I did.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.172
- Why didn't
you tell me?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.018
- Because I didn't
want you to feel guilty

35:24.050 --> 35:25.279
for something
that I did.

35:26.120 --> 35:26.939
- OK.

35:27.820 --> 35:30.118
You were protecting
me, I get that.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.356
I'm trying to protect you!

35:35.060 --> 35:36.459
- No, if wanted
to protect me,

35:36.500 --> 35:39.800
you would've run away
before you did this to me,

35:39.830 --> 35:41.229
like you did for Julia.

35:43.170 --> 35:44.069
But me?

35:46.040 --> 35:48.031
You had no problem
cursing me.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.137
I'll see
you tomorrow.

36:04.060 --> 36:05.050
- Hi.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.891
- Hi.

36:10.830 --> 36:13.595
We're going to stop this.

36:15.170 --> 36:16.592
(Scoffing)

36:16.640 --> 36:18.096
- What?

36:18.140 --> 36:19.665
- You didn't think
that I was gonna

36:19.710 --> 36:23.431
throw away a friendship
for this? Come on.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.641
(Scoffing)

36:24.680 --> 36:26.739
- What's wrong with you?

36:26.780 --> 36:28.339
- Three weeks.

36:28.380 --> 36:31.111
We've known each
other for 3 weeks.

36:31.150 --> 36:33.084
Aren't you getting
a little attached?

36:33.120 --> 36:34.281
(Scoffing)

36:35.190 --> 36:38.854
- OK, look me in
the eye, please, Aidan,

36:38.890 --> 36:42.224
and tell me
the last few weeks

36:42.260 --> 36:45.230
haven't meant
anything to you?

36:49.670 --> 36:52.935
(Heart pounding)

36:56.740 --> 36:57.639
(Pounding stops)

36:57.680 --> 36:58.943
(Exhaling)

37:00.210 --> 37:01.518
- It was just sex.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.211
Leave it alone.

37:13.530 --> 37:14.520
(Woman laughing)

37:14.560 --> 37:16.528
- (Woman 1):
That's awesome...

37:16.560 --> 37:18.369
(Women talking, indistinct)

37:18.400 --> 37:20.664
- (Woman 2):
Yeah, I wanted to tell you...

37:20.700 --> 37:22.099
(Women talking, indistinct)

37:27.340 --> 37:29.434
No! You're
the first person.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.732
How are
you today?

37:30.780 --> 37:33.101
(Laughing)

37:39.650 --> 37:41.015
(Growling)

37:52.330 --> 37:53.559
(Growling)

37:53.600 --> 37:56.467
(Honking, tires screeching)

38:04.140 --> 38:05.346
(Cars honking)

38:05.380 --> 38:07.508
- And then she
just hauled ass.

38:07.550 --> 38:10.417
And I looked for her at
the hospital, but no dice.

38:10.450 --> 38:14.353
And I had to avoid running
into Julia all day, so...

38:14.390 --> 38:15.585
You all right?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.155
- I'm gonna miss you

38:18.190 --> 38:20.022
if I ever go anywhere,

38:20.060 --> 38:21.425
I want you to know that.

38:27.170 --> 38:29.229
(Sighing)

38:29.270 --> 38:32.638
- What's with the suicide
hotline talk? Where you going?

38:32.670 --> 38:35.605
- Not into any babies,
that's for sure.

38:35.640 --> 38:39.178
But, um,
Zoe's gonna help me

38:39.210 --> 38:40.245
figure something out.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.339
- Zoe with the Manson stare?

38:42.380 --> 38:44.348
I'm sure she's wonderful.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.188
You guys can go on
a teen tour together.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.346
- OK.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.289
(Chuckling)

38:49.360 --> 38:50.509
- Um...

38:53.660 --> 38:55.549
I'm positive...

38:56.800 --> 38:58.791
that there's another way out.

38:58.830 --> 39:01.470
- I'm sure there is.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.734
Think she'll show?

39:05.770 --> 39:07.306
The moon's almost out.

39:07.340 --> 39:09.434
- I do not.

39:09.480 --> 39:14.202
No, she is stridently
anti storage unit.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.575
(Siren in distance)

39:24.360 --> 39:25.850
- And before you were...

39:25.890 --> 39:27.688
- No one that you'd
ever want to meet.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.696
- I remember you.
Aidan, right?

39:35.670 --> 39:38.503
I can't get over how
you people never change.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.134
You look exactly the same.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.434
- You look good.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.539
- Enough to eat, right?

39:45.580 --> 39:47.446
Come in.

39:47.480 --> 39:48.845
(Sniffling)

39:53.820 --> 39:54.981
- I'm sorry, who's this?

39:55.020 --> 39:56.112
- Oh, that's Perry.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.457
He keeps
an eye on me.

39:57.490 --> 39:59.822
You people have been getting
a lot rougher lately.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.520
You look hungry.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.598
It's still cash up front,
but, uh, the price has gone up

40:06.630 --> 40:08.189
since you were here
the last time.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.834
It's gonna be $300 now.

40:09.870 --> 40:12.760
- Hey, is he just gonna
stay here and watch?

40:12.810 --> 40:15.404
- If you don't want
to eat, you can leave.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.908
(Sniffling)

40:17.940 --> 40:20.250
So, what have you been
doing all this time?

40:20.280 --> 40:23.341
- Oh, you know, I've been
around, trying other things.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.280
- I guess that's what
life is all about,

40:25.320 --> 40:26.879
seeing what's out there.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.949
(Groaning)

40:30.990 --> 40:34.654
But it's still nice to have
something to fall back to, huh?

40:37.660 --> 40:38.991
(Heart pounding)

40:42.840 --> 40:44.763
(Teeth clicking)

40:50.580 --> 40:52.241
(Breathing unevenly)

40:58.420 --> 41:00.514
- You have no idea
how glad I am you came.

41:00.550 --> 41:01.620
Did something happen?

41:01.660 --> 41:04.652
- You were right.
Lock me up.

41:04.690 --> 41:07.182
(* Woman singing rock,
indistinct )

41:30.550 --> 41:32.188
- Enough, please!

41:33.090 --> 41:34.410
- She said that's enough.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.316
You gonna listen?
Enough!

41:36.360 --> 41:37.612
(Grunting)

41:51.040 --> 41:52.462
(Rattling)

41:53.670 --> 41:55.729
(Growling)
