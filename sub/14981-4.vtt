WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:09.033
Here you go.
Have fun and good luck.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.667
Thanks.

00:10.734 --> 00:12.767
I can't believe it.

00:16.133 --> 00:17.701
Hi.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.267
I'm Joan.

00:19.334 --> 00:20.767
Hi.

00:20.834 --> 00:23.133
Cal... are you Irish or...

00:23.200 --> 00:25.467
No, I'm English, actually.
Oh.

00:25.534 --> 00:27.467
That's so neat.

00:27.534 --> 00:30.200
So, what do you do?
I'm a furrier.

00:30.267 --> 00:32.467
Is that... like, fur coats?

00:32.534 --> 00:36.033
Fur coats, wraps,
stoles, hats,

00:36.100 --> 00:38.367
mainly fur coats, though.

00:38.434 --> 00:40.467
How about you?

00:40.534 --> 00:42.801
Um, I have to meet my friend.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.801
Well, maybe we can catch up later.

00:47.601 --> 00:49.934
Would you like one or two?

00:57.834 --> 00:59.100
Hey.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.901
Lose a bet?

01:00.968 --> 01:02.400
Basically.

01:02.467 --> 01:05.233
My friend over there dragged me along.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.934
If we were in a hotel room

01:07.000 --> 01:09.067
and you could order one
thing from room service,

01:09.133 --> 01:11.734
would it be chocolate cake,
strawberries, or warm honey?

01:13.767 --> 01:16.000
I beg your pardon?

01:16.067 --> 01:17.667
Oh.

01:17.734 --> 01:19.501
I got to take this.

01:19.567 --> 01:21.300
Yeah. what's going on?

01:21.367 --> 01:23.901
Hey. Uh, what's your ETA?
Oh, I don't know.

01:23.968 --> 01:25.567
You can't hurry love, Foster.

01:25.634 --> 01:27.968
Can I get a lager?
I hope that's your first drink.

01:28.033 --> 01:30.934
All right. D.C. police are looking
for a guy named Eric Matheson.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.100
He's been on the run for 2 days since
his wife was found beaten to death.

01:34.167 --> 01:36.267
So, they want us interviewing
friends and family

01:36.334 --> 01:38.200
To help determine if anybody's
helping him evade arrest.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.701
And I've already gotten Loker
and Torres in the field.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.901
Chardonnay, please.
I don't care...

01:42.968 --> 01:45.534
if he personally inspected
it before he shipped it.

01:45.601 --> 01:47.734
The painting's scratched,
all right?

01:47.801 --> 01:49.501
What are you talking about?
Tell him... you tell France.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.400
He's paying for the restoration.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.968
Otherwise, the whole thing
comes back his way.

01:54.033 --> 01:56.334
Collector?

01:56.400 --> 01:57.601
Dealer.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.734
I'm a curator.

01:59.801 --> 02:03.267
Really?
Really.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.267
I don't know.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.734
I guess the upside to having
been through a marriage before

02:07.801 --> 02:09.868
is that I not only know
what I'm looking for,

02:09.934 --> 02:12.434
but I know what I don't want.

02:12.501 --> 02:14.934
I just want to be happy.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.367
Like for me, right...

02:17.434 --> 02:19.934
This one thing is very,
very, very important to me.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.634
It may seem old-fashioned
to you, but that's fidelity.

02:23.701 --> 02:25.467
Yeah. For some reason,
I feel the need

02:25.534 --> 02:26.968
to be up front about that.
Heh.

02:27.033 --> 02:29.167
That's not old-fashioned.
It's important to me, too.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.534
Uh-huh.

02:30.601 --> 02:32.367
You know, the entire time I
was married, I never cheated.

02:32.434 --> 02:35.667
I was tempted and
certainly accused of it,

02:35.734 --> 02:38.000
but I never strayed...

02:38.067 --> 02:40.834
never.
hmm.

02:40.901 --> 02:43.968
Um, so,
what are your hobbies?

02:44.033 --> 02:46.501
What do you like to do on the weekends?

02:46.567 --> 02:49.434
I run a company that shrink-wraps
poodles for international travel.

02:49.501 --> 02:51.601
Um, um,

02:51.667 --> 02:54.033
I have to, uh,
go feed my meter. Ok.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.133
Um, I'll be right back.
Could you hold that thought?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.200
Yeah. I'll, uh,
save your seat.

02:58.267 --> 03:00.334
Thanks.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.834
Hey.
Hey.

03:04.901 --> 03:08.434
So, uh,
in answer to your question from earlier,

03:08.501 --> 03:11.133
it's warm honey, right?
Heh heh heh.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.133
You should call me sometime.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.634
Ok.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.534 --> 03:51.400
The place is clear. You
want us to stick around?

03:51.467 --> 03:54.067
No, I'm good, thanks. Go ahead and
check out the next name on the list.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.234
I'll be right behind you.

03:58.234 --> 04:00.968
Gwen, hi. I'm Ria Torres.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.901
I'm with the Lightman Group.
Yeah, the cop told me.

04:03.968 --> 04:05.901
Any idea where your brother might be?

04:05.968 --> 04:07.801
Running, apparently.

04:07.868 --> 04:10.901
Well, it'll be a lot easier for
Eric if he turns himself in.

04:10.968 --> 04:13.400
Yeah, I... I get that.

04:18.767 --> 04:21.033
His wife Connie was my best friend.

04:21.100 --> 04:24.467
I just can't believe she's dead.
But, uh...

04:25.501 --> 04:27.334
I don't know. Ok?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.367
Are we done here?

04:30.801 --> 04:32.434
Ma'am, why do I get the impression

04:32.501 --> 04:34.267
that there's something
you're not telling me?

04:34.334 --> 04:36.834
Well, there's a lot I'm not telling you.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.701
Like how I can't sleep, how I don't
know how I'm gonna tell my kids

04:39.767 --> 04:41.534
that their uncle might
have murdered his wife.

04:41.601 --> 04:44.033
I mean,
do you want me to go on?

04:44.100 --> 04:45.934
I don't know where Eric is.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.300
Do you know something that
could help us with this case?

04:48.367 --> 04:49.968
No.

04:50.033 --> 04:52.133
And I want you to leave.

04:56.033 --> 04:57.767
Now.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.667
Oh, God.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.934
You a cop?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.534
No.

05:25.601 --> 05:27.901
But they were here, right?

05:27.968 --> 05:30.667
They were here, weren't they?

05:30.734 --> 05:32.634
Yeah, yeah, they were here.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.868
God.
Look, you don't need to hurt me.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.534
I can help you.

05:36.601 --> 05:38.968
I can help you.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.767
Drive.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.634
Drive!

05:42.701 --> 05:45.300
Don't look at me. Drive.

05:52.167 --> 05:54.801
Hey, how did it go?
Put me out of my misery.

05:56.601 --> 05:58.200
Hi. Right.

05:58.267 --> 06:01.534
Sir, your ex never cheated on you.
There it is.

06:01.601 --> 06:03.400
You're positive?
Yup.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.400
I spoke to her for half an
hour at one of those, uh,

06:05.467 --> 06:06.801
uh, singles... mixers.
Singles what?

06:06.868 --> 06:09.467
Singles mixers,
and not a hint of shame or guilt

06:09.534 --> 06:11.767
when the subject came up.
Her virtue is intact. So...

06:11.834 --> 06:14.334
Let me remind you, there's
millions in alimony at stake.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.167
I'm well aware of the
terms of your prenup.

06:16.234 --> 06:18.033
I'm telling you, conclusively,

06:18.100 --> 06:21.067
your wife never violated the fidelity
clause, or however you put it.

06:21.133 --> 06:24.434
Maybe if I increase your fee, you
can run another one of your tests.

06:24.501 --> 06:26.634
All right.
Let me just stop you right there.

06:26.701 --> 06:29.434
The truth's the truth.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.133
Send me the bill.
I will.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.534
I definitely will.

06:38.701 --> 06:40.767
Boy, that was fun.
What's next? uh,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.767
peeking through keyholes or what?

06:42.834 --> 06:45.634
You leveraged this company to
buy your ex-wife out of this, ok?

06:45.701 --> 06:47.767
Yeah, only 'cause she was gonna
move my daughter to Chicago.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.434
Yeah, yeah. But now,
we are cash poor,

06:49.501 --> 06:51.300
and taking cases like
this helps us stay afloat.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.868
I don't care. I don't care.
What?

06:52.934 --> 06:54.634
I'll go back to working
out of my kitchen

06:54.701 --> 06:56.234
before I take another case that that.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.801
I don't care. I don't care.
All right.

06:57.868 --> 06:59.868
The bills, the books, the
payroll, fine. It's all yours.

06:59.934 --> 07:02.367
Hell, everything... everything,
it's all yours. You can take it.

07:02.434 --> 07:03.634
Will you calm down?
Will I calm down?

07:03.701 --> 07:05.033
What's the matter with you?

07:05.100 --> 07:06.734
I didn't kill my wife.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.133
And you people are gonna prove it.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.834
Hey!

07:10.901 --> 07:12.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:12.167 --> 07:14.267
You think I'm playing around?!

07:14.334 --> 07:16.901
Absolutely not.

Sync by honeybunny - corrected

07:49.601 --> 07:51.467
Cops start showing up,

07:51.534 --> 07:53.968
I start killing people.
Do you understand me?

07:54.033 --> 07:55.467
We understand you completely.

07:55.534 --> 07:57.300
You stick with me.
No, no, no.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.567
She... she just... she just
makes the tea around here.

07:59.634 --> 08:01.067
Let her go. I'm the guy.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.934
Uh, see the sign?
The Lightman Group.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.434
See that? The Lightman Group?

08:04.501 --> 08:06.200
Cal Lightman...
that's me. I'm the guy.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.601
I'm the one you want. Just let
her go, all right? I can help you.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.601
Hell no.
I need to see the front door.

08:10.667 --> 08:13.434
I have surveillance cameras up here,
up here, all down the corridors.

08:13.501 --> 08:15.501
My office is on higher ground.
You can watch them from my computer.

08:15.567 --> 08:16.667
Come on.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.000
All right.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.300
Everybody in here!
everybody in this room!

08:20.367 --> 08:22.501
Come on! Let's go, let's go.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.267
Move!

08:24.334 --> 08:26.901
I'm gonna do a head
count in half an hour.

08:26.968 --> 08:29.567
If anybody leaves or calls the cops,
he dies.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.100
Ok. Ok. No police.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.467
No police.
I'm serious!

08:34.534 --> 08:36.000
No police.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.868
It's on you now, buddy.
All right.

08:37.933 --> 08:38.967
Understand.
Yeah?

08:39.033 --> 08:41.534
Uh, we're gonna stay calm...

08:41.601 --> 08:43.267
You know,
get Cal out of this.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.100
I want you to go call Loker and
Reynolds and get them down here.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.234
But don't tell them what's going on, ok?

08:48.300 --> 08:50.167
Ok, go. Just be careful.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.901
Do your thing.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.901
Ok, so front and back
entrance in the lobby.

09:08.968 --> 09:10.701
Uh-uh. I said no phone calls.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.200
You said no calls to the police.
She's not stupid.

09:13.267 --> 09:16.033
You need to start being clear here.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.033
If I see any cops...

09:18.100 --> 09:20.701
You are familiar with what we do, right?

09:20.767 --> 09:23.200
Yeah.
She filled me in on the way over.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.868
You know that we're not law enforcement.

09:24.934 --> 09:26.934
Yeah, yeah.
You're, uh,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.033
some scientist who knows how to tell

09:29.100 --> 09:31.033
who's telling the truth, right?

09:31.100 --> 09:32.901
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.

09:32.968 --> 09:35.200
So, I got a question for you.

09:35.267 --> 09:37.801
If you know who killed your
wife and it wasn't you,

09:37.868 --> 09:40.567
why aren't you at the nearest
police station banging on the door,

09:40.634 --> 09:42.567
demanding they take action?

09:42.634 --> 09:45.567
That's something a
guy like you would do.

09:46.534 --> 09:48.334
I've had my run-ins with the cops,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.334
and they've never believed me yet.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.334
And when I walked in that
door and I saw my Connie

09:52.400 --> 09:53.834
dead on the floor...

09:53.901 --> 09:56.334
Ok. You got a knack
for telling who's lying?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.567
I got a knack for
knowing when I'm screwed.

09:58.634 --> 10:02.033
And in that moment, I knew
this would land on me.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.868
Fair enough.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.100
But no more shooting, no more
threatening those people out there,

10:06.167 --> 10:08.667
or you won't get my help,
and we'll both lose. All right?

10:08.734 --> 10:10.334
You more than me.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.434
I already lost everything I cared about.

10:12.501 --> 10:15.267
But you heard what I said, right, Eric?

10:15.334 --> 10:18.834
Do you believe me when I
say I didn't kill my wife?

10:21.367 --> 10:22.501
Yes.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.133
And you believe I'll kill you

10:24.200 --> 10:25.701
if you try to run a game on me?

10:25.767 --> 10:27.033
Yes, I do.
Ok.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.367
Am I being clear enough now?

10:29.434 --> 10:31.234
Yeah.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.667
So, Eric,

10:39.734 --> 10:41.701
tell me.
Who killed your wife?

10:43.501 --> 10:45.267
Are you out of your mind?
Just for a little while,

10:45.334 --> 10:47.167
until we figure out what's going on.

10:47.234 --> 10:48.834
This is a hostage situation!

10:50.200 --> 10:51.968
Well, Lightman's giving
us eyes in the room.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.734
How the hell did that guy
get in here with a gun?

10:53.801 --> 10:55.567
He has got the situation under control.

10:55.634 --> 10:57.467
Do you know what misprison means?

10:57.534 --> 10:59.801
It's failure to report a felony crime.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.434
Now, I'm not gonna risk the
lives of everybody out there

11:02.501 --> 11:03.968
and get fired in the process

11:04.033 --> 11:06.534
because Lightman thinks that
he's got a handle on this!

11:11.267 --> 11:13.701
Yes?

11:13.767 --> 11:16.334
Foster, could you come in
here for a minute, please?

11:16.367 --> 11:16.434
Sure.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.067
We've gotta figure out
who killed this guy's wife.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.667
Matheson did.
Innocent people do not run!

11:25.734 --> 11:27.901
If we don't do exactly
what this guy says,

11:27.968 --> 11:29.601
he will kill Cal.

11:32.334 --> 11:35.868
Can you please just help us out, Ben?

11:38.767 --> 11:40.300
All right.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.434
I'll hold off calling it
in for a little while...

11:43.501 --> 11:46.267
but only under one condition.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.267
Come on, come on, come on.

11:56.033 --> 11:58.501
How's everyone behaving?

11:58.567 --> 11:59.901
Perfectly.

11:59.968 --> 12:01.767
Good. all right.

12:01.834 --> 12:04.467
Ok, that's the address of Tom McHenry.

12:04.534 --> 12:06.300
He runs an advertising firm.

12:06.367 --> 12:09.767
Eric's wife used to work
for him as a bookkeeper.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.267
Now, Eric's claiming that...
I know. I know.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.934
Now, Eric knows...

12:15.000 --> 12:17.801
that McHenry was making
unwanted moves on his wife.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.367
And he considers him to be
the only suspect in her death.

12:20.434 --> 12:22.767
So, I'll need you to
track him down and, uh,

12:22.834 --> 12:26.167
interview him... and tape it
and bring it back to me.

12:26.234 --> 12:29.000
Well, what if he doesn't...
just find a way.

12:29.067 --> 12:30.367
Ok?

12:35.033 --> 12:37.300
Reynolds is here.
Who's he?

12:37.367 --> 12:39.834
He's a...

12:39.901 --> 12:42.234
Federal agent.
He works with us.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.267
Ohh. Same rules apply to
him as everybody else.

12:45.334 --> 12:47.434
He's, uh,
agreed to not call the police,

12:47.501 --> 12:50.067
but only if everyone in the
conference room is allowed to leave.

12:50.133 --> 12:52.934
You bring him in here.
I'll tell him what's allowed.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.701
It's nonnegotiable.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.100
You bring him in here!
Hey, hey, hey! Eric.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.767
What do you want to do?
You want to play king of the castle,

12:57.834 --> 13:00.467
or do you want to find out
who killed your wife?

13:02.701 --> 13:05.200
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Everybody out. Let's go.

13:05.267 --> 13:06.968
Don't say anything.

13:07.033 --> 13:10.100
Don't call anybody. Don't do
anything. Just go home and relax.

13:10.167 --> 13:13.100
We got the situation under control.
Ok?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.868
Come on, Heidi.
What are you doing?

13:14.934 --> 13:16.501
Let's go. Come on.
Follow everybody out.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.200
You really don't want
me to call the cops?

13:18.267 --> 13:20.033
No, I don't.
But I think we should call...

13:20.100 --> 13:22.868
No. Listen. Don't do anything,
all right? Not yet.

13:22.934 --> 13:24.601
I want everything on Matheson.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.767
Monitor all the hallway
surveillance off my computer.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.467
Anything happens,
call me and Reynolds.

13:28.534 --> 13:31.000
What? No, I'm not going
anywhere. I can't leave.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.434
It would help to have a badge to
convince this guy to talk to me.

13:33.501 --> 13:35.567
Well... I'll fake it.

13:35.634 --> 13:36.934
Ok.

13:38.701 --> 13:40.634
Leave your tie.
What?

13:40.701 --> 13:42.501
Come on.

13:44.868 --> 13:45.968
Thanks.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.968
Um, badge, too?

13:48.033 --> 13:50.133
No. No badge.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.000
I screwed up.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.934
Tom McHenry.
Yeah?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.234
All right,
you two, out. Come on.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.300
Get out. Let's go.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:10.367 --> 14:13.634
Hey. You gonna tell me
what this is all about?

14:13.701 --> 14:16.167
This is my colleague Gillian Foster.

14:16.234 --> 14:18.334
We're here about Eric Matheson.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.234
Did you find him yet?
We did.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.534
Good.
I hope he gets the death penalty.

14:22.601 --> 14:24.734
He's saying you killed Connie.

14:24.801 --> 14:27.200
Ohh. Wow. Heh.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.067
Did you?

14:29.133 --> 14:31.868
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a comment.

14:31.934 --> 14:33.901
Well, you're gonna need to, pal.

14:33.968 --> 14:36.734
You know what? This is further evidence
that Eric is a first-grade psycho.

14:36.801 --> 14:38.801
All right. Twice now,
you've done what we call

14:38.868 --> 14:41.133
a false inference dodge,
Mr. McHenry.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.133
You have yet to answer the question.

14:45.434 --> 14:48.501
No.

14:48.567 --> 14:52.501
This is why he's crazy. This is
why I had to let Connie go.

14:52.567 --> 14:55.133
He was convinced I was trying
to have an affair with her.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.534
He was convinced that I was filling
her mind with what a loser he was,

14:58.601 --> 15:00.634
as if she needed further proof.

15:00.701 --> 15:02.667
Well, then you won't mind
if we put you on tape.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.200
Heh. No, no. No. No.

15:05.267 --> 15:08.534
Why not?
I thought you were innocent.

15:12.734 --> 15:16.000
Ok, fine.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.901
Roll it.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.067
Who's that?

15:27.200 --> 15:30.133
That's my daughter.
You mind if I call her?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.634
Yes, I do.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.701
Take a seat.

15:40.167 --> 15:42.067
You married?

15:42.133 --> 15:44.033
Not anymore, no.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.868
So, which one you banging?

15:45.934 --> 15:49.133
Uptown chick or the salsa
queen that drove me here?

15:49.200 --> 15:52.267
Neither, actually.
Yeah, right.

15:52.334 --> 15:54.701
That's one thing I got
over guys like you.

15:54.767 --> 15:59.033
My woman loved me.
We had something real.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.567
Guys like you...

16:02.634 --> 16:04.167
empty.

16:04.234 --> 16:07.334
So, you try and fill yourself
up with n... nice suits

16:07.400 --> 16:09.501
and stupid art and show-off books

16:09.567 --> 16:12.534
and by nailing your employees
in the copy room.

16:13.968 --> 16:16.567
You got a job, Eric?

16:16.634 --> 16:19.667
Not currently. What does that
have to do with anything?

16:19.734 --> 16:21.501
Well, I'm sensing a little inner turmoil

16:21.567 --> 16:23.968
over the fact that your
wife was the sole provider.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.701
No. No, we were rock solid.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.434
We didn't care who made the money.

16:27.501 --> 16:30.767
Ah, that's something
you'd never understand.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.234
Ok.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.167
Ok.

16:35.234 --> 16:37.300
Don't... don't look at me like that.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.601
Like what?
Like you're better than me.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.367
I told you that I would know
if you were telling the truth,

16:42.434 --> 16:44.834
but I also know if you're
hiding something from me.

16:44.901 --> 16:48.200
I'm not hiding anything.

16:48.267 --> 16:51.634
You're projecting a...
little guilt.

16:51.701 --> 16:55.267
Yeah, that's either from self-
loathing or from something else.

16:56.734 --> 17:01.567
I'm just trying to figure out
why that's making you do this.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.800
They got half an hour
to get that tape here.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.200
Yeah.

17:13.701 --> 17:14.733
Yes, sir.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.634
Uh, no, no, they haven't yet.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.601
Everyone from the Lightman group
is out in the field right now

17:18.666 --> 17:20.934
interviewing Matheson's
friends and family.

17:21.001 --> 17:22.300
Uh-huh. Yes, sir.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.300
That's... that's really great, sir.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.567
Ok. All right. Bye.

17:26.634 --> 17:28.467
I'm screwed.

17:28.534 --> 17:31.034
Oh, good.
Foster and loker are back.

17:33.068 --> 17:34.500
Ria... come on.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.400
You gotta stop this.
You did nothing wrong.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.767
I should have locked the car.
Why didn't I lock the car?

17:38.834 --> 17:40.767
Look, you gotta quit beating
yourself up about it, all right?

17:40.834 --> 17:42.434
Stay focused.
We need your help on this.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.200
All right.
All right. All right.

17:44.267 --> 17:47.267
Hey.
We just ran Matheson's sheet.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.567
Police responded 3 times to their
apartment for domestic disturbance.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.601
The wife never filed charges.
I'm telling you, this guy's the killer.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.767
Well, he seemed believable
when he said he was innocent.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.100
"Seemed"?
That's not good enough.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.901
I'm taking this in to Lightman.
Whoa.

17:58.968 --> 18:00.634
Wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.133
Set it up in the lab.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.034
Tell Lightman that's where
he's got to watch it.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.567
Why?
Because I can get a better visual on the guy.

18:06.634 --> 18:08.968
Again, I don't want to rattle this
guy any more than we have to.

18:09.034 --> 18:11.034
Gillian, what's your priority, huh?

18:11.100 --> 18:14.500
Running errands for this lunatic or making
sure that Cal lives through the day?

18:18.034 --> 18:19.400
Where is it?

18:19.467 --> 18:22.200
It's just across the hall.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.001
Oh! Easy. Easy.

18:24.068 --> 18:26.133
All right. Take it easy.
Now, that's Reynolds.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.901
That's the guy I told you about.
He works here.

18:27.968 --> 18:30.601
Uh-huh. Open it.
Just calm down, all right?

18:32.434 --> 18:34.434
Stay back.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.601
Lock it.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.634
Lock the doors.

19:00.001 --> 19:03.200
Now, where are we watching this?
Huh?

19:03.267 --> 19:06.767
If you let go of my neck,
I'll show you, all right?

19:06.834 --> 19:09.801
All right. And I... I want
to see the front entrance

19:09.867 --> 19:11.834
and the back entrance and the lobby.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.634
Pull that up.

19:13.701 --> 19:15.968
There you go.

19:16.034 --> 19:17.667
Good.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.200
What's your name?
There he is.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.701
Tom McHenry.
Smug son of a bitch!

19:23.767 --> 19:25.534
How did you know Connie Matheson?

19:25.601 --> 19:26.867
She worked for me.

19:26.934 --> 19:28.901
Did you, uh,
ever socialize with her?

19:28.968 --> 19:31.100
Yes.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.567
Couple of times after work for drinks...

19:33.634 --> 19:36.167
That's it. Strictly platonic.

19:36.233 --> 19:38.034
Is he lying yet?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.968
Hey, could you shut up?

19:41.034 --> 19:42.968
Lightman just activated the audio.
Ly man.

19:43.034 --> 19:45.300
All he's got to do is bluff... just
tell Matheson that this guy is lying,

19:45.367 --> 19:47.601
and they he'll testify to it.
That's all he's gotta do.

19:47.667 --> 19:51.267
Tell me why someone would accuse
you of killing Connie Matheson.

19:51.334 --> 19:53.100
No sane person would.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.034
Only her husband Eric would do that.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.068
I didn't kill Connie.

19:59.467 --> 20:02.034
He's lying, right?

20:03.534 --> 20:07.133
Well, I see no typical
signs of deception.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.567
Can't be sure, but...

20:09.634 --> 20:12.267
I don't think he killed your wife.

20:12.334 --> 20:15.068
Ohh.
He's puttin' one over on you!

20:15.133 --> 20:17.434
Look, I'm good enough to
know you didn't do it.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.133
All right?

20:19.200 --> 20:21.968
Well, neither did he. No way.

20:22.034 --> 20:23.601
No way!

20:23.667 --> 20:25.200
Ohh.
why didn't he just bluff?

20:25.267 --> 20:26.467
Keep rolling
the tape.

20:26.534 --> 20:28.133
This guy is too close to Lightman.
If I can get

20:28.200 --> 20:30.367
some distance between them, I
can end this thing with one shot.

20:30.434 --> 20:31.934
Go on!

20:32.001 --> 20:35.068
When's the last time you saw Connie?

20:35.133 --> 20:37.267
3 weeks ago.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.834
She came into my office,

20:39.901 --> 20:42.834
asked for a loan to pay off a
debt that was weighing on her.

20:42.901 --> 20:44.634
That was the last straw.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.500
I told her she needed to
find employment elsewhere.

20:50.034 --> 20:51.801
He's lying.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.934
No, he's not.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.500
What debt?
I don't know.

21:02.567 --> 21:04.734
I don't know!

21:04.801 --> 21:07.233
Look.
you break into my office...

21:07.300 --> 21:10.434
You terrorize my staff,
you threaten to kill me.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.367
Well, congratulations.
You got my attention.

21:12.434 --> 21:14.667
So, now,
tell me what the hell's going on.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.701
Sit down.

21:18.968 --> 21:21.400
Let me think.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.534
Who did your wife borrow the money from?

21:28.601 --> 21:29.968
No one.

21:30.034 --> 21:31.834
That's a lie.

21:31.901 --> 21:33.801
No one!

21:33.867 --> 21:35.334
I did.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.834
Huh.

21:36.901 --> 21:38.500
Chump change... 10 grand.

21:38.567 --> 21:41.001
Who did you borrow it from?
A buddy...

21:41.068 --> 21:44.068
Who wouldn't do anything to Connie.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.300
How much have you paid back?

21:46.367 --> 21:48.100
That's the guy!

21:48.167 --> 21:50.167
And you're playing games with me?

21:50.233 --> 21:52.367
How much have you paid back?
None.

21:52.434 --> 21:55.300
It's... it's a fresh loan.
Th... there's plenty of time.

21:55.367 --> 21:57.233
You know,
I think I got you wrong.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.467
I think your wife approached you.

21:59.534 --> 22:01.467
She confronted you with the debt.

22:01.534 --> 22:04.300
And the argument got out of
hand, and then you killed her.

22:04.367 --> 22:06.267
You say that again.

22:06.334 --> 22:08.534
I dare you to say that again.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.667
Answer the question, all right?
No.

22:12.734 --> 22:15.167
I didn't kill my wife.

22:15.233 --> 22:17.167
I'm telling you,
he's gonna blow.

22:17.233 --> 22:18.934
What's your buddy's name?

22:19.001 --> 22:21.167
I'm not gonna let you throw up
the smoke screen, all right?

22:21.233 --> 22:23.267
You don't know what the hell
you're doing, do you?

22:23.334 --> 22:25.100
You got 3 options here.
You can pull the trigger,

22:25.167 --> 22:27.001
you can walk out there and
take your lumps with the cops,

22:27.068 --> 22:30.133
or you can tell me your buddy's name!
All right?!

22:35.434 --> 22:38.133
Are you gonna tell me
your friend's name?

22:46.667 --> 22:49.601
Danny Pavelka.

22:49.667 --> 22:53.400
All right. now...

22:54.834 --> 22:57.601
Danny Pavelka.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.534
Ok, thanks. There he is.

23:06.667 --> 23:09.500
Danny Pavelka.
Yeah.

23:09.567 --> 23:12.968
Yeah, we're here to talk to you about
the money you loaned Eric Matheson.

23:13.034 --> 23:14.901
What's that got to do
with him killing Connie?

23:14.968 --> 23:16.300
He didn't.

23:16.367 --> 23:18.034
Well, who did, then?

23:18.100 --> 23:19.901
See, this may come as a surprise to you,

23:19.968 --> 23:22.300
but that's why we're
standing in front of you.

23:22.367 --> 23:25.133
Well, you just wasted a trip.
I just got back in town this morning

23:25.200 --> 23:27.968
From Atlantic City, and I got
the motel bills to prove it.

23:28.034 --> 23:29.567
So, how late was he on the loan?

23:29.634 --> 23:31.634
First of all,
I didn't loan him Jack.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.167
I facilitated a loan.
Who carried the note?

23:34.233 --> 23:36.267
That's my business.
You want more?

23:36.334 --> 23:38.467
Get a court order.
Danny,

23:38.534 --> 23:40.334
we just ran your sheet
on the way over here.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.200
And it clearly states
in your parole agreement

23:42.267 --> 23:44.534
That you have to check in
with your PO once a week.

23:44.601 --> 23:46.534
Well, you missed one 2 weeks ago.

23:46.601 --> 23:48.200
He said he was gonna let that one slide.

23:48.267 --> 23:50.034
Oh, really?

23:50.100 --> 23:51.634
Well, see,

23:51.701 --> 23:53.467
I'm a little bit more of a stickler.

23:53.534 --> 23:56.334
So, you're gonna tell me
everything I want to know

23:56.400 --> 23:57.834
Right now!

24:06.233 --> 24:08.167
Foster and reynolds spoke with Pavelka.

24:08.233 --> 24:10.001
Connie found out about the debt.

24:10.068 --> 24:12.801
She went to Pavelka,
told him that Eric and she

24:12.867 --> 24:14.968
weren't gonna be able to pay the debt.

24:15.034 --> 24:17.034
I'm standing right here.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.200
She begged Pavelka to forgive the debt.

24:19.267 --> 24:21.767
He told her it wasn't up to him,
so she has to talk to the guy

24:21.834 --> 24:24.801
who gave Pavelka
the money for you... Eric.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.233
His name is Mike Zancanelli.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.701
Foster and Reynolds are on their
way over to talk to him right now.

24:32.767 --> 24:34.667
You know who this is?

24:34.734 --> 24:37.068
I've never heard of him.

24:37.133 --> 24:38.801
Uh...

24:38.867 --> 24:41.734
Did he say how Connie
found out about the loan?

24:41.801 --> 24:43.233
I don't know.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.934
He did tell Foster that he
wasn't surprised she came,

24:46.001 --> 24:48.834
'cause she was always having to
clean up your messes, apparently.

24:49.867 --> 24:52.001
That will do, Torres.

25:04.801 --> 25:07.267
Why the guilt, Eric?

25:12.133 --> 25:13.901
That guy right there.

25:13.968 --> 25:16.634
Well, it looks like him.
The one in the black hat, right?

25:16.701 --> 25:18.167
Yeah.

25:18.233 --> 25:20.233
There's no way he's gonna say
squat in front of his boys.

25:20.300 --> 25:23.200
Well, then we'll have to take him back
to the Lightman group to talk to him.

25:23.267 --> 25:25.634
What? Heh.

25:25.701 --> 25:27.867
How? look, look.

25:27.934 --> 25:29.734
This isn't even about
saving my job anymore.

25:29.801 --> 25:31.834
Most likely, that's gone.
I've accepted that.

25:31.901 --> 25:34.867
But if go in there and drag this
guy out in front of 15 people,

25:34.934 --> 25:37.434
this whole under-the-radar
thing is done.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.434
Now, come on, Gillian.
I mean, we gave it a shot.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.300
It's time to call this thing in.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.100
Ben, n... no.
What?

25:43.167 --> 25:46.867
There's one thing Matheson said
today that I believe is absolutely true.

25:46.934 --> 25:50.867
If he sees the cops...
he will pull the trigger.

25:50.934 --> 25:53.901
He will.

25:53.968 --> 25:57.667
Yeah, well,
we're out of options, so...

26:02.734 --> 26:05.567
All right.
What are you doing?

26:06.701 --> 26:09.001
No. no.
You're not going in there.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.001
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

26:11.068 --> 26:13.100
Oh, God. Be ready.

26:13.167 --> 26:16.567
I'm going to jail.

26:17.834 --> 26:19.534
What do you think?

26:19.601 --> 26:22.667
You... you don't want
to know what I think.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.534
Hi. Could I use your phone?
Please?

26:38.601 --> 26:40.034
Sure. There you go, darling.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.601
Thank you.

26:44.267 --> 26:47.100
Damn it. Thank you.

26:55.133 --> 26:56.734
Hi.
Hey.

26:56.801 --> 27:00.534
Do any of you guys
know how to fix a flat?

27:06.100 --> 27:09.500
Did you know your wife reached
out to Pavelka about the money?

27:09.567 --> 27:11.068
No.

27:11.133 --> 27:13.701
You didn't think you were in
trouble not having paid it off?

27:13.767 --> 27:15.300
No.

27:16.934 --> 27:19.167
Your wife's death...

27:19.233 --> 27:22.100
and the money that you owed
are in no way connected,

27:22.167 --> 27:24.367
in your mind.
That's right.

27:24.434 --> 27:28.300
Your wife was beaten to death.
Your apartment was ransacked.

27:28.367 --> 27:32.801
Who do you know that's that angry
and wants something of yours?

27:32.867 --> 27:36.534
That describes a lot
of people I know, man.

27:38.334 --> 27:42.667
That's your guilt, isn't it?
For contaminating her?

27:42.734 --> 27:44.934
You didn't want to drag
her into your world.

27:45.001 --> 27:49.367
You considered her a pure soul, and
you tried like hell to keep it that way.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.634
And now she's dead.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.567
There's no way you can tell all
that just by looking at my face.

27:56.634 --> 27:59.968
Well, just the guilt part.

28:03.167 --> 28:06.167
Where does the rest come from, then?

28:06.233 --> 28:11.133
Well, that's how I feel sometimes
about women I know.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.367
Did he mean that?

28:18.801 --> 28:21.100
You brought this on her somehow, Eric.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.934
That's one thing you're gonna have
to live with, but murder charge isn't.

28:25.001 --> 28:26.801
All right?

28:26.867 --> 28:29.567
And what had you hoped to
gain by coming in here?

28:29.634 --> 28:32.834
To be proven innocent?
Well, I'll testify to it.

28:32.901 --> 28:35.734
To find out who really killed her?

28:35.801 --> 28:38.334
I'm helping you. All right?

28:38.400 --> 28:40.400
There's no further need for that gun.

28:40.467 --> 28:42.901
You just put it down,
you just walk away.

28:42.968 --> 28:44.968
This never happened.

28:45.034 --> 28:47.400
Oh, I wish I knew if
I could believe you.

28:47.467 --> 28:51.801
You can.
you're gonna have to trust me.

28:51.867 --> 28:54.500
I will tell the police
that you were innocent.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.801
Just put the gun down.

28:56.867 --> 28:58.534
Walk away.

29:06.968 --> 29:09.034
Ok.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.734
Ok.

29:13.801 --> 29:15.534
What the hell is this?

29:15.601 --> 29:17.567
What the hell is this?!

29:19.034 --> 29:21.300
I told you no cops!

29:21.367 --> 29:24.300
I can't believe I
trusted your lying ass.

29:24.367 --> 29:26.267
What are we gonna do?

29:36.067 --> 29:37.933
She's good.
She'll take care of it.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.267
I thought you said
she just makes the tea.

29:40.334 --> 29:41.668
May I help you?

29:41.734 --> 29:43.601
Ma'am, we got a call from
one of your employees

29:43.668 --> 29:45.334
saying there might be
a disturbance here.

29:45.401 --> 29:47.601
Um, nope. Not here.

29:47.668 --> 29:49.434
He was very insistent.

29:49.501 --> 29:51.501
He said someone might be armed.

29:51.567 --> 29:53.933
Well, I think I would know if someone
had a weapon here at work.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.668
Tell you what. Why don't we
take a look just to be safe, ok?

29:56.734 --> 29:58.933
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

30:11.534 --> 30:13.701
So, what was the person's name?

30:13.768 --> 30:15.567
Who called this in?

30:15.634 --> 30:17.567
Raymond Moncrief.

30:17.634 --> 30:20.900
Ugh. I am so sorry, officer.
we fired ray today,

30:20.967 --> 30:24.734
for misuse of company funds. He
had to be escorted from the building.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.900
Uh, this is him looking for his
payback. I guess it's just like him.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.167
Is that right?

30:34.267 --> 30:35.933
Excuse me.

30:39.501 --> 30:41.334
Just let go of me.
I'll take care of...

30:41.401 --> 30:43.200
I'll do this. I'll do this.

30:43.267 --> 30:46.034
Can you open this, ma'am?

30:51.301 --> 30:52.900
What's the problem?

30:52.967 --> 30:55.467
Uh, Moncrief's hassling us again...

30:55.534 --> 30:57.800
Crank called the cops
about someone with a weapon.

30:57.867 --> 31:02.034
You did tell him that's
my problem, right?

31:04.734 --> 31:06.668
We were just taking a look around, sir.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.734
"Were." That's good.
That's past tense.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.867
Perfect, 'cause I'm trying
to run a business here.

31:10.933 --> 31:12.734
Sure.
Thanks, man.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.301
Thank you.

31:20.734 --> 31:22.567
Sorry for the interruption.
Mm-hmm.

31:22.634 --> 31:25.234
Have a nice day.
No problem.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.967
False alarm.

31:40.534 --> 31:42.900
It's just a matter of time
till they come back.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.167
Then leave before they do.

31:45.234 --> 31:47.967
My colleagues are out there. They're
talking to this Zancanelli character.

31:48.034 --> 31:50.000
They'll get to the bottom of it.

31:50.067 --> 31:52.234
Just put the gun down and walk away.

31:53.434 --> 31:54.567
Right in here.

31:54.634 --> 31:58.367
Who's this? Who's this?

31:58.434 --> 32:00.734
Is that Zancanelli?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.367
That can't be.

32:02.434 --> 32:04.501
So...

32:07.167 --> 32:09.134
Connie Matheson.

32:10.701 --> 32:12.301
How do you know her?

32:12.367 --> 32:14.067
I loaned some money to a friend.

32:14.134 --> 32:17.267
That friend gave it to
Connie's husband, apparently.

32:17.334 --> 32:21.034
So, tell me about that conversation,
you know, between you and Connie.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.200
It was about the loan.
Connie was under the impression

32:23.267 --> 32:25.234
that I gave the money
directly to her husband,

32:25.301 --> 32:27.567
while charging him an
exorbitant interest rate.

32:27.634 --> 32:29.100
And I didn't.

32:29.167 --> 32:31.768
That would be usury,
which is illegal.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.100
And have you ever visited the apartment

32:35.167 --> 32:37.034
that Connie shared with her husband?
No.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.234
Never been to Eric's wife's apartment.

32:39.301 --> 32:41.800
He just changed nouns...
from Connie to Eric's wife.

32:41.867 --> 32:44.501
Yeah. Plus, he answered no too quickly,
and his voice was a different pitch,

32:44.567 --> 32:47.034
a little higher.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.100
Doesn't make sense killing
Connie over 10 grand.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.867
Do we even need to know the real answer?

32:50.933 --> 32:53.334
I mean, why can't we just go in there
to Matheson with something we cook up?

32:53.401 --> 32:55.933
Remember, all we're trying to do is get
him to put the gun down and walk out.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.100
No, we still have time, Ben.
To do what?

32:58.167 --> 33:00.134
There's no one else to talk to.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.000
The sister...
Matheson's sister.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.534
She said she was Connie's best friend,

33:03.601 --> 33:05.067
and she definitely was
hiding something earlier.

33:05.134 --> 33:06.800
Good. Go.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.167
Connie came to me
a couple of weeks ago,

33:15.234 --> 33:17.768
and she wanted to borrow
a digital recorder.

33:17.833 --> 33:19.867
I figured she could just go buy one,

33:19.933 --> 33:23.200
So I assumed she wanted me
to ask what she needed it for.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.800
She told me she had a fling
with this guy, one-time thing,

33:25.867 --> 33:29.434
and he wanted more, so she was gonna
tape their phone conversations.

33:29.501 --> 33:32.833
To get him to back off.
Yeah, that's what I figured.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.701
This guy is married?
Yeah.

33:34.768 --> 33:36.900
She say anything to you after
she borrowed the recorder?

33:36.967 --> 33:38.833
She said it worked, um,

33:38.900 --> 33:41.534
but she was gonna keep
the file just in case.

33:41.601 --> 33:44.167
Her only fear was that
Eric might find it.

33:44.234 --> 33:47.200
And when she was killed,
I thought maybe he had.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.234
All right.
Let me get this straight.

33:58.301 --> 34:00.668
Connie came to you about the loan...

34:00.734 --> 34:02.501
you know,
how she couldn't pay.

34:02.567 --> 34:05.367
You told her something could be...

34:05.434 --> 34:08.400
worked out...
you know, a trade.

34:08.467 --> 34:10.734
Right?
So, she had sex with you.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.734
But you wanted more.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.501
She recorded a phone
conversation she had with you

34:15.567 --> 34:18.400
trying to get out of it, and then you
went over to Connie's apartment

34:18.467 --> 34:20.800
looking for that recording.
didn't you, Mike?

34:20.867 --> 34:23.634
It's like I told the black dude.
I've never been to her place before.

34:23.701 --> 34:26.434
You turned the place upside down,
and you found that digital recorder.

34:26.501 --> 34:29.534
Man. You're in Fantasyland,
lady. You know that?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.900
She was gonna show it to your wife,

34:31.967 --> 34:33.933
and you lost your temper.

34:38.668 --> 34:41.833
No apartment, no recording,

34:41.900 --> 34:43.833
no dice.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.734
Is he lying?

34:45.800 --> 34:47.501
Damn straight.

34:51.034 --> 34:52.833
Connie tried to seduce this guy?

34:52.900 --> 34:55.167
She'd never do that.
No, no, you're right.

34:55.234 --> 34:57.334
You're right.
And... and she didn't.

34:57.401 --> 35:00.301
But he sexually blackmailed her

35:00.367 --> 35:04.067
to, uh,
to pay off your debts.

35:04.134 --> 35:08.267
Eric, we did everything
that you... you asked.

35:09.701 --> 35:11.933
Let him go.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.134
Foster...

35:14.200 --> 35:15.467
Please.

35:15.534 --> 35:17.034
Foster.

35:26.367 --> 35:29.434
Lock it. Lock her out.

35:42.134 --> 35:44.467
I'm sorry about that.

35:44.534 --> 35:46.200
I mean it.

35:46.267 --> 35:49.000
Let's get the cops in now.
Let's...

35:49.067 --> 35:51.634
I'll tell them you didn't do it.
No.

35:51.701 --> 35:54.800
Zancanelli is who they
brought in. We both know it.

35:54.867 --> 35:56.933
And I want 5 minutes alone with him.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.634
I can't let that happen.

35:58.701 --> 36:00.401
Uhh!

36:12.833 --> 36:14.833
It's either him or you.

36:17.067 --> 36:18.701
I mean it.

36:29.601 --> 36:31.601
Uh, after all the...

36:31.668 --> 36:33.967
Headaches you put Connie through...

36:34.034 --> 36:35.067
Shut up!

36:35.134 --> 36:36.367
After all the headaches
you put her through,

36:36.434 --> 36:38.334
after all the hard work she spent

36:38.401 --> 36:40.601
trying to make you feel like a man,

36:40.668 --> 36:42.401
there is one way you can honor her.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.434
And I bet you'll tell me what it is!

36:44.501 --> 36:46.000
Live your life!
Live your life.

36:46.067 --> 36:48.334
If you take your
revenge out on this guy,

36:48.401 --> 36:51.634
you will be the fool that she
spent her entire adult life

36:51.701 --> 36:54.567
trying to convince other
people that you were!

36:54.634 --> 36:57.668
I have no life without her.

36:59.567 --> 37:01.833
You ready?

37:01.900 --> 37:04.434
I want Zancanelli!

37:04.501 --> 37:06.900
I know you're watching!

37:06.967 --> 37:10.567
I'll do it! I'll do it!

37:10.634 --> 37:13.000
No, no, no, no.
I want Zancanelli!

37:13.067 --> 37:14.867
He's gone from contempt
to extreme anger.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.134
He's working his way up to shoot.
We gotta give him what he wants.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.034
Yeah, right... just march Zancanelli
in there so this guy can shoot him.

37:20.100 --> 37:23.434
Welcome to the one thing
that I won't do today.

37:23.501 --> 37:25.967
I've got an idea.

37:28.867 --> 37:30.534
Look.

37:33.567 --> 37:35.668
You're really gonna make this mistake?

37:35.734 --> 37:37.401
It's either him or you.

37:37.467 --> 37:39.367
Well, then,
it should be me, right?

37:39.434 --> 37:41.634
Open the door.

37:50.967 --> 37:52.933
5 minutes with Zancanelli...
that's it.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.134
Don't do this, Foster.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.067
You're just gonna talk to him?
Yeah.

37:56.134 --> 37:58.701
He's lying, all right?
You can tell he's lying, right?

37:58.768 --> 38:01.034
All right, give me your word.
You're not gonna hurt him.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.167
You have my word. I swear.

38:03.234 --> 38:05.534
He's gonna kill him.
He's gonna kill him.

38:05.601 --> 38:07.900
I'll bring him in.
He's gonna kill him.

38:07.967 --> 38:10.067
She values your life more than you do.

38:10.134 --> 38:13.768
Join the club. Bring him in!

38:22.634 --> 38:25.134
And you...
you get the hell outside!

38:25.200 --> 38:28.234
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to make
sure that this stays a conversation.

38:28.301 --> 38:30.234
Then I want your hands up.

38:30.301 --> 38:31.800
Hands up!

38:41.967 --> 38:45.567
And you... you scared yet?

38:45.634 --> 38:48.067
Like Connie was?

38:48.134 --> 38:51.668
I want to see that look in your eye.

38:51.734 --> 38:54.134
Get out of the way.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.768
Get away from him!

39:01.134 --> 39:03.567
Your wife wanted me to tell
you something before she died.

39:06.501 --> 39:09.467
You got 5 seconds to
tell me what she said.

39:14.067 --> 39:15.467
Tell me!

39:15.534 --> 39:16.967
Uhh! Uhh!

39:17.034 --> 39:19.100
Uhh! Oh, God!

39:25.000 --> 39:26.567
All right.

39:41.267 --> 39:42.701
Hey...

39:42.768 --> 39:45.267
I'll call this in.
Ok?

39:45.334 --> 39:47.267
I'll do the talking.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.634
So, what do you do?

39:58.701 --> 40:01.067
All right.

40:01.134 --> 40:03.734
I'm gonna give you an honest answer.

40:03.800 --> 40:07.034
Heh heh heh.
I'm already intrigued.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.000
I try to help people...

40:09.067 --> 40:12.534
"try" being the operative word.

40:12.601 --> 40:15.034
I know that must sound foolish

40:15.100 --> 40:17.534
or pretentious or both,

40:17.601 --> 40:20.200
but there it is.

40:22.200 --> 40:27.301
So, describe your ideal woman.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.000
Well, I could describe her
till the cows come home,

40:31.067 --> 40:34.401
but the real question is whether
or not I'm her ideal man.

40:34.467 --> 40:36.701
You never know till you try, right?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.933
Yeah.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.334
Why don't we give it a shot?

40:41.401 --> 40:44.000
You know,
with some room service...

40:44.067 --> 40:46.534
Serve warm honey, right?

40:46.601 --> 40:49.234
Hmm.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.768
I shouldn't be here.

40:59.634 --> 41:01.900
I'm sorry.

41:24.768 --> 41:26.768
Hey. Hi.
Hey.

41:29.534 --> 41:33.434
Uh, Zancanelli confessed
to Connie's murder, so...

41:33.501 --> 41:35.800
I heard.
Yeah.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.567
I'm sorry I ran out like that.

41:41.634 --> 41:44.833
No, everybody's dealing
with it in their own way.

41:46.567 --> 41:49.467
I'm just...

41:49.534 --> 41:52.367
I'm just glad you're all right.

41:52.434 --> 41:53.933
How's your head?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.768
Ooh. uh, fine.

41:56.833 --> 42:00.567
Listen, I was thinking
about that whole, um...

42:00.634 --> 42:03.768
accounts thing, that whole
billing thing, you know.

42:03.833 --> 42:06.701
We'd be working out of a shoe
box if it wasn't for you. So...

42:06.768 --> 42:09.467
Uh, it's all yours.
And I'll respect that.

42:09.534 --> 42:11.467
No. No, no. No, you're right.

42:11.534 --> 42:14.167
I mean,
cheating spouse cases... I mean,

42:14.234 --> 42:16.267
we're better than that.

42:16.334 --> 42:19.434
All right.

42:19.501 --> 42:23.267
Well, whatever you decide, all right?
Ok.

42:23.334 --> 42:26.434
All right, then.

42:26.501 --> 42:30.167
Listen, I was just popping by really
just to see how you were doing.

42:30.234 --> 42:32.034
Um, are you...

42:32.100 --> 42:34.200
I'm ok.

42:34.267 --> 42:35.501
Good.

42:35.567 --> 42:37.267
Where's Emily?

42:37.334 --> 42:39.334
She's at her mum's.
Oh.

42:39.401 --> 42:42.668
I haven't told them
about all of this yet.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.867
Can I sleep in your
spare bedroom tonight,

42:50.933 --> 42:53.768
if it's not too much of a problem?

42:53.833 --> 42:54.967
Of course.

42:55.034 --> 42:56.634
Ah, good.

42:56.701 --> 42:58.200
Hey.

43:05.634 --> 43:07.100
All right.
