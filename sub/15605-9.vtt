WEBVTT

00:08.280 --> 00:10.040
'Ex On The Beach is back.'

00:12.400 --> 00:18.080
'This time, it's all-stars. Old faces
return for another shot at love.'

00:18.160 --> 00:20.920
Am I looking for love? Fucking yeah.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.280
'They'll have to endure
their exes...'

00:23.360 --> 00:26.000
I've never, ever
felt like this in my life.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.760
'Some will have to deal
with old grudges...'

00:29.840 --> 00:32.360
You've had more dicks
than I've had sun beds.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.760
'And as hard as they try
to find their perfect match...'

00:35.840 --> 00:37.880
Right, who wants to finger me?

00:37.960 --> 00:42.360
'Standing in their way once again
will be the Tablet of Terror.'

00:42.440 --> 00:45.200
I won't lie,
I'm cacking myself big time.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.960
'It's going to be
hotter than ever before.'

00:48.040 --> 00:50.080
I wanna ride her. Giddy up, Amy.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.600
'As emotions boil over.'

00:52.680 --> 00:56.440
And then you made me realise there's
more to life than what I was doing.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.840
'Tensions run high.'

00:57.920 --> 00:59.800
Dare ya, I fucking dare ya!

00:59.880 --> 01:01.240
Let's fucking go, kid.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.040
'And the claws come out.'

01:03.120 --> 01:06.680
...to your face, which I'm...

01:06.760 --> 01:10.440
'So far, ten exes have arrived.'

01:11.160 --> 01:13.800
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.920
I did not think that
I was gonna feel like this.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074

01:38.680 --> 01:42.120
I kind of slept with Chrysten
when I was with Lillie.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.480
Gary, like,
I've never felt so hurt.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.360
Lillie's great, but Chrysten,
I wanna rip her little panties off.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.360
Christen, did you kiss him
in the bathroom?Yes.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.840
It's a pretty scary thought

01:56.920 --> 01:59.680
when somebody's not the person
you think they are.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.200
I don't wanna see you
with other people here.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.760
Why's that?
Because it hurts me.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.360
I am apologising now
and I do want us to get on.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.720
He can look at me,
not even do anything and I'll smile.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.720
(laughter, champagne pops)

02:14.800 --> 02:16.520
I eventually banged Olivia.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.200
Liv got the parsnip,
I wanna do it again, all the time,

02:21.280 --> 02:23.480
everyday, every second.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.000
Oh, it's mine. Great.
Fuck, it's Aimee.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.560
It's another one to add
to the list you shagged.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.200
Every fucking day more shit comes
out of the woodwork with that prick.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.840
Are you fucking joking me?!

02:47.600 --> 02:51.120
I've woke up this morning with Ash,
yet again I feel great,

02:51.200 --> 02:55.360
we're getting on.
I just hope nothing fucks this up.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.040
You know what? when Kayleigh's not
nagging and getting on my nerves,

02:59.120 --> 03:02.080
I enjoy spending time with her.
Hopefully it continues.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.440
He's openly said, "Kayleigh,
it doesn't matter who comes in."

03:05.520 --> 03:08.200
"I'm with you."
So, if he does get with someone now

03:08.280 --> 03:10.280
he's not only ruining
our time in here,

03:10.360 --> 03:13.760
he's ruined our friendship
on the outside.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.120
Now Aimee's here, there's no chance
I'll go back to Holly, we are done.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.880
So, Conor, did you shag Aimee?
No.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.080
I slept in his bed.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.960
Honestly crack on because you're not
gonna get with anyone else in here.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.520
I don't need to, like, mate.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.200
You only get with girls at home cos
you can get them on your guest list.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.840
I fucking hate Conor,
the stupid, lanky, skinny prick.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.680
Good luck with Aimee. If you don't
pull her, you won't get anyone.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.600
You couldn't pull a muscle,
that's if you had any.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.560
I'm not bothered.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.600
Is she off her nut?
Fucking hell, hun.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.600
Aimee, top girl. Ten out of ten.
For Holly, I'd have to go minus ten.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.040
She's minus her
fucking marbles as well.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.079
Last night was full of drama again,

04:21.160 --> 04:24.440
everyone was asking me, "Did you
kiss Bear, did you kiss Bear?"

04:24.520 --> 04:28.880
It was just too much pressure,
I couldn't handle it any more.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.720
I had to get it off my chest
and say something.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.720
It's annoying that Bear's lying,
obviously people will believe me.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.520
To keep peace in camp I'm gonna keep
denying that I've kissed Chrysten.

04:41.600 --> 04:46.920
Deny, deny, deny till you die,
stick a fork in your eye, woo!

04:56.520 --> 05:01.080
I was so bored of the Lillie
situation, I felt I was tied down.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.800
Me and Lillie are done now, I just
wanna kiss all the other birds.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.720
I don't even have the time of day
for Bear any more.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.400
He is the one that has pulled
Gary up for losing a girl like me,

05:14.480 --> 05:18.600
yet he's technically just done
exactly the same thing.

05:18.680 --> 05:23.800
I just don't know how
I will trust anyone ever again.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
'Lillie's lost faith in finding love,

05:28.080 --> 05:31.040
but who'll pray for mercy
when the next ex

05:31.120 --> 05:34.160
preaches more unfinished business?'

05:34.240 --> 05:36.680
(evil laugh)

05:39.080 --> 05:40.600
(tablet chimes)

05:40.680 --> 05:42.720
Ah, fuck off. Really?

05:44.760 --> 05:48.160
Don't get too relaxed, all-stars,
as it's beach time.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.840
Hawley...Tablet of Terror,
you little fucking tinker.

05:51.920 --> 05:52.960
...Kayleigh...

05:53.040 --> 05:56.840
I'm having fun in the villa, you're
gonna chuck in a really nasty ex,

05:56.920 --> 05:58.040
is that what this is?

05:58.120 --> 06:02.120
...and Gaz, it's time to go greet
one of your exes.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.880
Round five?

06:03.960 --> 06:07.880
Do you reckon it'll be yours Gaz?
It's obvious.Yeah!

06:07.960 --> 06:10.280
Surely there can't be another one,

06:10.360 --> 06:13.880
we've just got over the whole Lillie
thing and we're in a good place.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.760
I'll be gutted if Gaz comes back
with an ex he still cares about.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.320
I feel like it's my second home.
You should live down here.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.520
Back again.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.200
Cheers to what's about
to come out the water.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.440
We shouldn't cheers,
we should be wishing us luck.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.200
Best of luck. I feel like a weight's
been lifted off me shoulders

06:41.280 --> 06:45.280
with Jemma leaving. But being here,
fuck knows what's gonna happen.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.040
Could be yours, Kayleigh.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.560
If your ex comes out, tablet goes off
saying you're on a date.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.000
That's gonna piss Ash off.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.080
If my ex comes out,
I'm gonna have one big problem.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.320
I just can't imagine what else
can get thrown at us.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.320
I've confessed a lot of things
to Lillie about Chrysten

07:01.400 --> 07:04.520
and three other girls,
imagine if one of them turns up.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.600
Wow.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.040
You go out and get the drama.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.440
I've had me drama. Come on, tablet,
do us a fucking favour.

07:11.520 --> 07:16.040
Gaz, he's fed up now.
He's got three exes in that villa,

07:16.120 --> 07:20.880
but it's your fault, you shouldn't
put your dick in so much pussy.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.080
Shit's gonna fucking hit the fan.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.560
Oh, I'm kicking back.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.200
I'm not even gonna think about it,
I'm not thinking about it.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.280
Aimee, course I'll go there,
she is gorgeous,

07:40.360 --> 07:42.240
she's harmless

07:42.320 --> 07:45.600
and she's Conor's bird, which
makes it all the sweeter, right?

07:47.880 --> 07:50.240
Yeah, look at him.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.600
I'm not here to get Conor back.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.960
He thinks I am,
but I'm here to meet new guys.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.160
He's a little shit.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.160
You made me drink pool water.

07:59.240 --> 08:04.040
He's full of shit, he's a little
shit and he's a fucking gimp.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.240
What the fuck, Aimee?
He couldn't give a fuck about her.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.720
He's just gonna mug her off like
he does with every other bird.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.920
Could be this ex, could be that ex,
could be anyone.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.520
If it's Hawley's ex, in all honesty,
I'll be absolutely buzzing.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.880
Fuck this, man.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.720
I could do without this right now.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.320
It could be one of mine

08:36.400 --> 08:39.880
and I know Gary, he'll be fucking
straight in for the kill.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.800
Fuck off.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.320
Once again, that tablet, it just
knows all my secrets, don't it?

09:12.040 --> 09:14.120
What the fuck?
Hello!

09:14.200 --> 09:18.200
(laughs)
Fucking hell.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.560
Gary seems fucking happy to see her.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.360
Mate, do you not realise
the shit that this is gonna cause?

09:27.240 --> 09:31.600
'Self-proclaimed queen bitch Melissa
was surprised by her ex Gaz...'

09:31.680 --> 09:33.360
'...in series two.'

09:33.440 --> 09:35.120
It's fucking Gaz.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.000
'After a night of fun,
they went their separate ways

09:38.080 --> 09:40.720
and a real love affair
started with Kayleigh.'

09:40.800 --> 09:43.440
'Unfortunately,
the friendship turned frosty.'

09:43.520 --> 09:46.040
I don't give a fuck.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.960
'When Mel got her hands
on her best mate's man.'

09:50.040 --> 09:52.560
Congratulations,
you're the biggest bitch.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.600
'None other than Kayleigh's
current squeeze, Ashley Caine.'

09:56.680 --> 09:59.200
When I go in this villa,
if I see something I want,

09:59.280 --> 10:01.120
I'll take it. I don't give a fuck.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.520
I've got no loyalties
to these bitches.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.680
I'm coming back to reclaim my crown.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.200
Do I hug you? Or do I slap you?
Is the question.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.400
Shit.
Fucking hell.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.600
What the fuck are you wearing?
You need me as a best friend

10:17.680 --> 10:20.320
cos I need to give you
some fucking fashion advice.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.800
I've been so nervous
coming in here for you...

10:22.880 --> 10:24.200
What happened?

10:24.280 --> 10:26.800
You stopped speaking to me
after being sisters,

10:26.880 --> 10:30.440
she was my sister
and she stopped speaking to me.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.200
When my best friend lies to me or
when I feel like I can't trust them

10:34.280 --> 10:37.800
with my life,
I cut them out of my life.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.600
Mel will go for Ash, obviously,

10:39.680 --> 10:43.360
that's what she done in series two
and that's when we were tight.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.720
And I tried to speak to you...
But I didn't want to speak to you.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.240
I did not want to speak to you.
OK, then, yeah.

10:49.320 --> 10:54.120
Don't give a shit about her, or
anyone, I'll do what the fuck I want.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.880
Lillie's in there.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.600
(laughs) Awkward.
(giggles)

10:59.680 --> 11:02.680
Does she know that we fucked
when you were together.

11:02.760 --> 11:07.000
Oh, shit. Really?
Gary mate, you're fucked.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.360
How's Lillie gonna react knowing
me and you slept together?

11:10.440 --> 11:11.440
Fucking hell.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.440
Every time I think things
are going a little bit better,

11:14.520 --> 11:19.200
something else just fucking
gets thrown at us, man.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.200
I told her there was more than one.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.200
I didn't expect more than one
to turn up, though.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.520
'There's no getting out
of this, Gaz.'

11:26.600 --> 11:27.720
(tablet chimes)

11:27.800 --> 11:29.120
Oh, shit.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.600
'Saved by the bell.'

11:30.680 --> 11:32.400
Oh, my God.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.360
What the fuck's gonna happen next?
Welcome to the beach, Melissa.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.080
Time to get touchy feely. Melissa
and Hawley, you're off on a date.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.360
All I'm thinking about is me chod,
slapping it on her.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.000
Right then, shall we get off?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.440
See you in a bit.
Bye-bye. See ya tonight.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.440
It'll be very touchy feely. I'm never
gonna say no to nothing like that.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.520
(sighs)

11:58.600 --> 12:02.720
So I've now gotta live with Olivia,
who I'm banging,

12:02.800 --> 12:08.520
Charlotte Dawson, who I banged,
my ex girlfriend and two girls...

12:08.600 --> 12:10.800
You fucked behind her back.
Out of the four

12:10.880 --> 12:12.240
I got with behind her back.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.400
This is fucking not Ex On The Beach,

12:14.480 --> 12:16.280
it's just fuck Gary on the beach.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.400
Just when you think things
can't get any worse for me.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.720
You're joking. Which one's crawled
out the woodwork now, Gary?

12:40.360 --> 12:44.280
Who is it? Is it the one...?
It's not Charlotte, is it?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.200
Melissa Reeves.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.600
(Ashley laughs)

12:48.680 --> 12:50.560
Why is that so bad?

12:50.640 --> 12:53.680
Cos that's one of the people
I slept with behind your back.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.200
I'm just speechless.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.360
No fucking way.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.640
She's not here to make any friends,
she walked up the beach

13:03.720 --> 13:06.200
like, "I dunno whether
to hit you or kiss ya."

13:06.280 --> 13:07.640
You?
Yeah.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.240
I thought you two were mates?

13:09.320 --> 13:11.920
Mel doesn't give a shit
who she hurts.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.120
Lillie's not gonna be
able to handle it.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.560
Gary, when we saw her in District
was it before or after that?

13:18.640 --> 13:19.800
Before.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.240
She was all nice to my face knowing
she'd slept with my boyfriend?Yeah.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.920
It was bad enough living
with one person that Gary

13:27.000 --> 13:31.280
cheated on me with,
now I have to live with two.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.600
That's not a spanner in the works,
that's a whole fucking toolbox.

13:35.680 --> 13:40.000
Why didn't you tell me
that the other day, Gary?

13:40.080 --> 13:44.280
I told you there was more than one
person, I didn't think she'd turn up.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.840
I don't even know
who I wanna even be any more.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.440
I just can't imagine
living with Lillie.

14:00.520 --> 14:05.120
I feel so sorry for Lillie,
she's had such a shit time.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.440
Lillie don't deserve that, man.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.200
Just as we all thought it was gonna
be a nice entertaining night

14:13.280 --> 14:16.720
with a really nice
new arrival, we get Melissa Reeves.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.960
Fantastic. Let the games begin, eh?

14:20.040 --> 14:22.120
I better get myself ready.

14:22.200 --> 14:26.760
For what? For you to do the exact
same thing you done last time?

14:29.440 --> 14:32.160
Well, that's awkward.
Kayleigh is not happy at all.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.800
She's got a face like thunder.

14:33.880 --> 14:38.120
Does she think I'm gonna kiss her?
She fucking knows I will.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.040
Why don't you get yourself ready?

14:40.120 --> 14:43.320
This time round I feel
like if he does it all over again,

14:43.400 --> 14:46.440
me and Ashley are never gonna
get together ever again.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.160
I will say hello to her, give her
a kiss and let her crack on.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.760
'Ashley's playboy past has
got Kayleigh fearing for the future,

14:57.080 --> 15:02.000
but who'll want to step back in time
when the next ex attacks?'

15:02.080 --> 15:03.920
(evil laugh)

15:14.440 --> 15:16.360
How's your day been anyway?

15:16.440 --> 15:20.560
I've had a blinder, mate. Aimee's
fit and we're getting on good.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.800
Bit of kissing, the usual.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.760
Tonight I'm gonna crack on
with Aimee, have a bit of fun,

15:27.840 --> 15:31.560
we're gonna wind up in the penthouse
rumping all night.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.760
I fucking got sunburnt
really bad, fell asleep.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.280
Conor, I don't like the fella,
I'm gonna really wind him up.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.680
So, who's having
the penthouse tonight, then?

15:42.760 --> 15:46.320
You didn't seal the deal with Lils,
so try with Aimee, innit?

15:46.400 --> 15:49.600
Cheers, mate. Thanks. Aimee's sexy.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.200
It's all right, man.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.680
Ta-da!

15:56.040 --> 15:58.880
'Mel's cooled off
from her Kayleigh encounter,

15:58.960 --> 16:02.960
but Hawley has the chance to get her
hot under the collar all over again.'

16:03.040 --> 16:04.280
'Romance.'

16:04.360 --> 16:05.640
This place looks sick.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.880
Hawley's hot and he's nice,
but you know, I'm a prick tease.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.320
He ain't gonna get a kiss
on the first date, absolutely not.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.480
So, I can see that you and Kayleigh
have got some issues,

16:15.560 --> 16:16.760
what's that all about?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.600
As far as I'm concerned, I'm done.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.880
I've got shit
she won't want me to say.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.440
Kayleigh and Mel
are gonna fucking boot off.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.840
I'm just gonna graft
and see where I get.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.440
This will be more fun
if we do it to each other.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.800
You do it on me,
I'm not giving you one.

16:30.880 --> 16:35.080
I like to receive, not give.It's
a good start. I'm not complaining.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.120
Finally, these Thai birds
have fucked off

16:38.200 --> 16:40.880
and I'm thinking game time, kit off.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.960
So, do you think you'll do anything
with Gaz, or is that yous two done?

16:49.040 --> 16:51.960
We'll see how this date goes.
See how this date goes?

16:52.040 --> 16:53.200
(laughs)

17:00.960 --> 17:03.160
Do you want it harder, or softer?

17:03.240 --> 17:04.720
Erm, a bit harder.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.960
I think Hawley
liked massaging my bum.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.280
Your bum's shocking.
It's fucking sick.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.880
I can't blame him,
so I allow him to do so.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.960
I always find a way to control men.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.200
I'm over the top of her and all
I can do is stare at her arse.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.480
Fuck knows what she's saying,
I'm just squeezing this.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.839
Do you reckon I get a kiss before
we go back? To finish the date?

17:27.920 --> 17:33.840
I actually surprisingly
really do like Hawley

17:33.920 --> 17:36.840
and I didn't think I would.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.920
Well, I've had a fucking good time.
I've had a good time as well.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.040
But we'll see what else
I've got to choose from first.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.200
I can't actually physically
cry any more.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.800
I don't believe you didn't
do it all the time.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.960
I didn't cheat on you all the time.
I'm looking at Gary,

18:09.040 --> 18:11.680
and I see completely who he is now.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.760
You've just made me feel
like I'm never

18:13.840 --> 18:19.160
gonna be able to, like,
trust anything anyone says to me.

18:24.840 --> 18:28.320
Doing it's one thing, dealing
with the consequences is another.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.440
And looking at Lillie right now,
I do feel guilty.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.920
So sorry it's came out like this.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.960
Every time I'm like, get past this,
something else comes along

18:39.040 --> 18:42.280
and I'm just like for God's sake,
like, what is wrong with me?

18:42.360 --> 18:47.360
Nothing's wrong with you,
you've done nothing wrong, it's me.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.200
I swear I've never cried in my life

18:49.280 --> 18:53.760
and, like, the last week I've like
nearly had two fucking breakdowns.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.800
I don't wanna talk to you any more.

18:59.880 --> 19:05.040
I just seriously
can't take it any more.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.840
'Lillie's world has already
been shattered by the new arrival

19:19.920 --> 19:23.240
and Mel's imminent approach
is on everyone's mind.'

19:23.320 --> 19:27.800
Hawley's needed new material. He
wants a girl because cos he ran out.

19:27.880 --> 19:31.280
On the date, I'm sure the date
said something about touchy feely.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.960
When Melissa enters this villa,
it's going to be fireworks.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.320
She is a first-class bitch.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.600
Talk of the devil and he may appear.
Hey.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.960
Good day, yeah? You all right?
Yeah.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.800
She's looking quite fit, so
if I want Mel, I'm gonna go get her.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.960
What's your name?
Holly. You all right?

19:50.040 --> 19:52.360
I'm Melissa, good to see ya.
And you.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.840
She just completely blanked me.
Yeah, I know, I saw that.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.880
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.400
What else has gone on?
What have I missed?

20:06.480 --> 20:09.160
Well, you obviously know
my ex-boyfriend, Gary,

20:09.240 --> 20:11.840
but we don't need
to go in to that, do we?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.520
Fuck this, man.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.600
Do you not think
you owe her an apology?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.840
I'm not sorry, because I didn't know

20:21.920 --> 20:24.680
he was actually in a serious
relationship, it's Gaz,

20:24.760 --> 20:28.160
you hear rumours but I would
never think he was actually settled.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.920
I could not give a fuck about Lillie.
She wants Gaz, who's a player,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.360
then acts shocked when he cheats
on her, that's not my problem.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.600
I was single, he was in a
relationship so I ain't got no fault.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.440
I honestly did think I was gonna
get angry tonight, but then...

20:45.040 --> 20:48.760
...when you're in the situation,
like,

20:48.840 --> 20:51.320
it's very hard
to control how you feel.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.280
(Lillie crying)

20:57.920 --> 21:00.680
It's just a bit, like, pathetic.
Get over it.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.040
He's cheated on you, big wow.

21:04.880 --> 21:09.200
I'm not her friend
and I don't have loyalties to her.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.840
To be honest with ya, everything
else going on now does not matter,

21:12.920 --> 21:15.960
Lillie's upset
and that is my main priority.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.440
I hate Gary, but he's also the only
person in here that I really know.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.840
She can slap us, she can swill us,

21:53.920 --> 21:57.440
she can do what she wants,
but I am not leaving her side.

21:57.520 --> 22:03.040
Shh. Come on, come on.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.320
Like, I care about you.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.360
I don't care if you believe it or
not I'm telling you I care for you.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.920
Gaz and Lillie
will get back together,

22:22.000 --> 22:23.960
they're all over each other.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.600
All over each other.
Are they?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.440
I've spent most of my nights
in this villa with Gary,

22:29.520 --> 22:31.720
why does he think
he can do this?

22:31.800 --> 22:35.120
There's no need to just pick
and choose when you want me.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.320
I don't wanna get upset
because I'm fine,

22:37.400 --> 22:41.880
I'm a strong person and I can
deal with it for the next few days.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.400
(sighs)

22:56.200 --> 22:59.280
Me and Aimee, we're getting close,
we're kissing, fuck it,

22:59.360 --> 23:01.720
let's go to the penthouse, yay.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.120
I'm gonna bend her over, get her
in the shower, what's happening?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.200
A bit of shower gel,
what's happening?

23:08.280 --> 23:12.800
I'm gonna go from there because
tonight I'm gonna tango, baby.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.600
Bear is off the table tonight,

23:15.680 --> 23:19.400
I like to flirt with him,
but he's not gonna get anywhere.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.320
First thing she says to me is,
"Bear, where's my makeup?"

23:25.400 --> 23:27.840
What you gonna do, babe,
powder your arsehole?

23:32.120 --> 23:34.400
I'm having a shitter.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.880
'Bear's bonfire is well
and truly soaked,

23:39.960 --> 23:43.000
but sparks are flying
elsewhere in the villa.'

24:03.840 --> 24:06.400
Oh, my God

24:12.640 --> 24:16.040
Conor, who's that?

24:16.120 --> 24:18.480
Olivia.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.160
(Lillie laughs)

24:27.440 --> 24:29.800
I've woken up with Aimee,
and to be honest,

24:29.880 --> 24:32.800
she was more concerned
about her makeup than kissing me

24:32.880 --> 24:34.720
so I thought, fuck this.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.480
So, for me, she's not the one, I'm
gonna move on, I'm gonna sweep her

24:38.560 --> 24:40.040
under the Bearsy carpet.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.080
Even though me and Kayleigh
have been getting on well,

24:44.160 --> 24:45.720
I wanna crack on with Melissa,

24:45.800 --> 24:49.480
cos I've been there and done that
with Kayleigh, I need something new.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.840
I'm scared history's gonna repeat
itself. Melissa's top slag

24:52.920 --> 24:54.480
and Ash thinks with his dick.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.000
If he does fuck me over
it is gonna hurt me.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.400
I think Ashley and, erm,
Mel looks like a good couple.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.360
With me and Kayleigh,
it's complicated.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.760
I've got loyalties to her
because we were friends for so long,

25:12.840 --> 25:16.920
but then I think should I? Cos she's
disrespected me by cutting me off.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.840
My thrill in life
is making men fight over me,

25:24.920 --> 25:26.680
it's just fun to watch.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.560
He's just a gentleman, isn't he?

25:28.640 --> 25:32.680
I'm gonna play the field a little
bit and then I'll take me pick.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.520
(laughter)

25:43.400 --> 25:45.400
Last night I think I hit rock bottom

25:45.480 --> 25:49.200
and actually needed somebody
to comfort me that actually knew me

25:49.280 --> 25:51.320
and the only person in here is Gary.

25:51.400 --> 25:56.040
I think no matter what Gary does,
I'll always love him in some way.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.680
You can love someone,
but not want them

25:58.760 --> 26:02.320
and I think that's maybe
who Gary will always be to me.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.720
I wanna make sure Olivia's all right,
it's just a messy situation.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.960
I do feel like Gary has used me
slightly whilst being here.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.800
He's been going through a lot

26:18.880 --> 26:21.880
and I've always been there for him
and we've had fun,

26:21.960 --> 26:23.640
but when it comes to my feelings,

26:23.720 --> 26:26.120
I feel like he's not
really been there for me.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.960
'With some of the group
firing blanks,

26:36.040 --> 26:40.400
the Tablet of Terror has given them
a chance to unleash their load.'

26:40.480 --> 26:43.040
Oh, my God, we're paintballing.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.840
We're going paintballing! Woo!

26:50.920 --> 26:54.640
This is fucking war,
get your game faces on, let's do it.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.760
You lot over there, you lot come
with me. Fucking game time, people.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.960
I'm used to spraying girls, but this
is taking it to a whole new level.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.040
One, two, three.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.240
(shouting)

27:12.360 --> 27:14.200
Fuck off.

27:15.480 --> 27:18.680
Mel's looking fit so I wouldn't mind
if someone shot Kayleigh

27:18.760 --> 27:21.120
and put her out of action for a bit.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.520
Ow! Don't fucking shoot me,
you pricks!

27:26.120 --> 27:27.880
(screaming)

27:27.960 --> 27:29.800
Mel came in giving it all that,

27:29.880 --> 27:31.720
put her in a ring like this, mate,

27:31.800 --> 27:34.320
she starts screaming
like a little girl.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.680
(Melissa screams)

27:37.760 --> 27:40.600
Gaz is coming, get him.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.280
Get him, get him. Wahey!

27:43.360 --> 27:45.400
Yeah, you shitter!

27:47.680 --> 27:48.800
(Ashley laughs)

27:48.880 --> 27:52.520
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute,
how fit is Mel?

27:52.600 --> 27:54.040
Yeah, she's fit, ain't she?

27:54.120 --> 27:56.280
That's why I'm trading Kayleigh.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.440
She likes Ash,
likes a bit of the Caine.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.920
I'll do it tonight
and let you know how it is.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.640
I'm gonna let Ash go in
all guns blazing,

28:03.720 --> 28:06.680
which Melissa doesn't like
and swoop in and take her.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.240
You talk very confident,
but I think I'm the dark horse...

28:10.320 --> 28:13.720
(mimics horse, laughs)

28:13.800 --> 28:17.200
Listen, I'll put her on your back
to carry to my bedroom, mate.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.040
(laughter)

28:20.120 --> 28:21.960
Melissa's gonna go for me.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.480
At the end of the day,
a girl wants the gorilla,

28:24.560 --> 28:27.040
not a fucking junior monkey
(mimics monkeys).

28:27.120 --> 28:30.800
May the best man win.
Let's fucking get out there.Quick!

28:38.000 --> 28:39.960
'While the paintball game rages on,

28:40.040 --> 28:43.240
Gaz and Lillie have managed
to find a cosy little area

28:43.320 --> 28:46.800
in the middle of the battlefield
for a heart to heart.'

28:47.960 --> 28:51.200
Me and Gary are like two
little kids around each other today

28:51.280 --> 28:54.320
in a school playground.
We're both nervous and don't know

28:54.400 --> 28:57.960
whether we should be by each other,
or it's just a bit awkward.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.320
Last night, when I ran after ya

29:00.400 --> 29:02.880
and I was in the bedroom
and you cuddled us,

29:02.960 --> 29:07.400
at that moment then,
that's when I realised what I'd done.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.200
Last night I was there for Lillie and
that was the most important thing,

29:11.280 --> 29:14.080
but all I can do now
is try and do the right thing.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.680
It's mad, cos in that situation
you'd think the last person that you

29:17.760 --> 29:21.680
wanna be comforted by is the person
that hurt you but, like,

29:21.760 --> 29:25.080
I think you're the only person
in here that really knows me.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.520
If me and Lillie spend the rest of
our time here in bed together,

29:28.600 --> 29:32.280
there's gonna be a risk that feelings
come back and we can't have that.

29:32.360 --> 29:36.400
Obviously from here forward...

29:38.120 --> 29:41.480
...I don't think it's a good idea
we spend every night together.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.720
All good?

29:42.800 --> 29:45.800
I probably do love Gary
and always will love Gary,

29:45.880 --> 29:49.720
but I am ready to
close that book now

29:49.800 --> 29:52.240
and hopefully
never pick it back up.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.480
Can I have a hug?

29:53.560 --> 29:54.960
(gunshot)

29:55.040 --> 29:56.840
Can we have a hug?
Can I have a hug?

29:56.920 --> 29:59.320
Can we have a hug.
Are you serious?

29:59.400 --> 30:01.480
I just...
You nearly took my foot off.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.880
I wish I was aiming this way...

30:03.960 --> 30:05.840
Get that gun away from me.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.400
'After Gaz left Olivia
out in the cold,

30:11.480 --> 30:16.160
the Tablet of Terror has given
Bear a chance to warm her up.'

30:16.240 --> 30:18.840
I'm pissed off with Gary
and that whole situation

30:18.920 --> 30:22.680
and I know Bear's the perfect guy to
have fun with and have a laugh with.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.680
Cheers for good times.
Good times. Always.

30:25.760 --> 30:30.720
And to being single.
Olivia is hurt by Gaz, right?

30:30.800 --> 30:33.680
I can't wait to swoop in
and give her a comfort kiss.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.880
This is my time to shine, baby.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.800
Gaz was in bed
with Lillie last night, snogging.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.320
That's true.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.480
What happened there?
I thought he was your boyfriend?

30:43.560 --> 30:46.600
I thought me and Gaz
really got on and had something,

30:46.680 --> 30:49.400
but thinking about it,
he has just used me

30:49.480 --> 30:52.680
and I'm not gonna let a guy
do that to me. I deserve more.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.880
I think it's nasty.
I'm better than that.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.560
You're pretty. If you wasn't taken,
you're the type of girl I go for.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.920
Why am I just sticking with Gary?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.920
Like, he clearly doesn't really
care about me too much,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.440
so I should just have fun.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.080
Now you're single,
I wanna mingle with ya.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.240
(laughs)

31:10.320 --> 31:13.280
I told Olivia,
you are my number one,

31:13.360 --> 31:16.880
I just wanna have some fun with her
and Olivia seems very fun.

31:16.960 --> 31:22.000
Say if me and you were
to have a bit of fun...

31:22.080 --> 31:24.480
Olivia, you gotta promise me, right?

31:24.560 --> 31:27.800
That you're never, ever
gonna go back with Gaz again.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.800
I promise.
You promise?Promise.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.840
I am so done with Gaz,
he's mugged me off too many times,

31:35.920 --> 31:39.240
I'm totally single now and I'm
stronger and better than that

31:39.320 --> 31:40.960
and I'm not having it any more.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.880
I am nobody's doormat,
I'm gonna go back into that villa

31:48.960 --> 31:51.160
and stay with Bear.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.760
Shots!

31:57.840 --> 31:59.920
'It's party time at the villa,

32:00.000 --> 32:04.600
but Gaz won't be jumping for joy
when he hears about Bear's conquest.'

32:07.080 --> 32:09.680
Oi-oi!

32:09.760 --> 32:11.840
Hi, everyone.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.680
Did you have a great time or what?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.000
We had a great time.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.280
Did you kiss?
I was very surprised like...

32:17.360 --> 32:18.720
Did you kiss?
Yeah, we did.

32:18.800 --> 32:23.320
Do they honestly think I am arsed?
Olivia was a bang.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.880
Me and Bear always got on

32:24.960 --> 32:27.800
and Bear put a few things
into perspective for me.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.080
I can't just be picked up
and dropped.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.480
Gary is fuming
and I fucking love it.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.480
Now, Gaz mugged her off twice,

32:35.560 --> 32:39.560
his head was turned by Chrysten
and also last night

32:39.640 --> 32:42.160
Lillie and you kissed,
is that acceptable?

32:42.240 --> 32:43.480
Of course it's not.

32:43.560 --> 32:44.680
You fucking lied.

32:44.760 --> 32:48.640
Mate, if you wanna go for another one
of my seconds, fine. Crack on.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.920
(laughter)

32:51.000 --> 32:53.240
Gaz is pretending like
I'm not bothered

32:53.320 --> 32:58.360
but I can see it in his face, he's
fucking bitter, jealous and annoyed.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.760
Do not start trying to pull me out
after all I've been through,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.480
I've admitted I've done wrong,

33:03.560 --> 33:06.840
I've sorted things out with Lillie,
had a wicked time with you.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.840
Go have a wicked time with Bear.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.000
I'll go to bed by myself,
I don't care.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.560
Bear, to me,
you are honestly not a threat.

33:13.640 --> 33:17.240
If I wanted to, I reckon I could
get back with Olivia tonight.

33:17.320 --> 33:21.320
If you could go to bed with anybody
tonight, would it be Gary or Bear?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.920
It would be... Bear.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.080
Are you choosing Bear?
Yeah.

33:28.160 --> 33:32.000
Gaz is used to being top dog,
but in this villa he's not,

33:32.080 --> 33:35.320
because I'm the top dog really.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.520
Bear and Olivia, Bolivia.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.480
'Olivia's left Gaz
with a taste of neglect,

33:50.560 --> 33:53.880
but who'll be eating their words
when the next all-star ex

33:53.960 --> 33:55.400
sours the villa?'

34:00.920 --> 34:02.840
'Gaz may have had his fingers burnt,

34:02.920 --> 34:06.760
but Ashley isn't
afraid of playing with fire.'

34:07.800 --> 34:11.080
I'm still definitely gonna go
for Mel, she's the prize in here.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.800
If that fails,
I've got Kayleigh to fall back on...

34:13.880 --> 34:15.960
...fall back in.'(laughs)

34:20.560 --> 34:22.679
It is what it is
and we'd have good sex...

34:22.760 --> 34:26.239
We'd have angry, hatred sex,
like, "Fucking hate you."(laughs)

34:26.320 --> 34:28.840
The sex would be fucking next level.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.679
Exactly and I don't think he will.
I don't think he will.

34:34.760 --> 34:38.679
Ash has openly said he will not
touch anyone else in this villa

34:38.760 --> 34:40.520
for the duration of our time here.

34:40.600 --> 34:44.159
If he does, he's lost someone
he can fuck and he's lost a friend.

34:44.239 --> 34:48.320
If he wants to take that risk over
a slag from Liverpool, go ahead.

35:12.920 --> 35:17.080
She told me she's got shit on you,
is that why you're not kicking off?

35:17.160 --> 35:19.240
Melissa, you got loads
of shit on me?

35:19.320 --> 35:22.360
You know I've got shit on you.
Exactly what I've got on you.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.440
How?

35:23.520 --> 35:26.560
The fights between Kayleigh
and Melissa are irrelevant.

35:26.640 --> 35:30.360
The real argument here is me. Girls,
there's enough of me to go around.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.160
OK, Melissa, you wanna play
that game with me, yeah?

35:33.240 --> 35:36.400
Kayleigh, don't start...
Melissa play that game with me.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.920
Mel knows mine and Ashley's history,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.120
for her to come here and flirt
with him in front of my face,

35:42.200 --> 35:45.720
I ain't gonna fucking stand for it.
Go on then, play the game.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.320
You ain't got shit, at least I can
get a boyfriend to stay with me,

35:49.400 --> 35:52.000
you can't get a call back
when you fuck someone.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.840
Kayleigh's doing this,
cos the attention's off her.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.720
She's ugly, no-one gives a shit.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.760
I'm the one getting more attention,

35:58.840 --> 36:01.200
she's jealous
and she always has been.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.240
If you wanna talk about boyfriends,

36:03.320 --> 36:05.880
shall I come at you
with your boyfriends? No.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.640
That bitch better watch herself.

36:08.760 --> 36:13.200
Don't go there with my boyfriends,
seriously, do you wanna go there?

36:13.280 --> 36:15.560
Do you wanna go there with Ash?
Test me then!

36:15.640 --> 36:18.000
Do you wanna go there
with what you did?!

36:18.080 --> 36:20.040
Fucking tramp!
Do you wanna go there?

36:20.120 --> 36:22.600
You're a 30-year-old, old cow!

36:22.680 --> 36:25.840
She's a fucking slag
with a conky nose,

36:25.920 --> 36:28.600
saggy-ass tits
and she thinks she can speak to me.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.160
You're a fucking old woman,
go and get a job.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.680
Are you joking, babe?
You had sex for fucking money...

36:34.760 --> 36:37.440
I never had sex for money.
You dirty little tramp.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.200
Go fuck yourself you fucking...

36:39.280 --> 36:42.080
Tonight has proven
exactly why I do not like the girl

36:42.160 --> 36:46.640
and I have no interest in making
a friendship ever again.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.240
Who the fuck does she think she is?

36:49.320 --> 36:51.240
Fucking droopy-ass tit slag.

36:51.320 --> 36:54.280
Go and get your nose job done,
you fucking bitch.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.360
I'm still in the game,
it's blown up,

36:56.440 --> 36:58.760
hopefully it's gonna
push her away from Ash.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.880
That's my opportunity to move in.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.480
'Mel's ended up in bed
without her man,

37:09.560 --> 37:14.240
but is Olivia still fighting
for independent women everywhere?'

37:14.320 --> 37:16.280
'Probably not.'

37:17.920 --> 37:20.080
I always ended up with you.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.080
My girlfriend after two years
walked back in this house

37:23.160 --> 37:25.480
and what did I do?
The next day, I banged you.

37:25.560 --> 37:28.760
I had every intention
of not going back to Gary,

37:28.840 --> 37:32.840
but Gary is a massive charmer,
he knows exactly what to say.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.400
After I banged you again
and again and again,

37:35.480 --> 37:39.480
Chrysten came in, "Gaz, are you
gonna get back with Chrysten?"

37:39.560 --> 37:42.240
To be honest with you...
(muffled speech)

37:42.320 --> 37:46.320
I said I've got Olivia,
it doesn't matter.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.760
Even though I know
I shouldn't go back with Gary,

37:49.840 --> 37:53.200
I just can't help myself
and I want to.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.720
Babe, where you gone?

38:13.560 --> 38:17.000
I'm praying that Olivia
hasn't gone to bed with Gaz,

38:17.080 --> 38:20.760
cos he's gonna use you,
like he has this whole time.

38:22.720 --> 38:27.440
Olivia tried to pie me for Bear,
but it didn't work. Unlucky, mate.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.280
What are you doing? Are you thick?

38:37.360 --> 38:41.680
I can't take an Olivia
to water and make her drink it.

38:41.760 --> 38:46.560
Now the Bear don't care about you.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.440
Hasta luego.

38:58.520 --> 38:58.720
.
