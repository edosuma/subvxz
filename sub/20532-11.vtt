00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.711
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:14.980
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.982 --> 00:17.716
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.052
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.690 --> 00:25.557
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.559 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:33.565
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:40.672
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.579 --> 00:51.750
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:08.769 --> 01:10.769
- Hey, Sofia.
- Whatcha doing?

01:10.771 --> 01:12.438
I've got a snack for Clover,

01:12.440 --> 01:14.173
but he won't wake up
from his nap.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.408
Come on, Clover,
don't you want your snack?

01:16.410 --> 01:17.743
Fresh veggies.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.412
- ( sniffing )
- Clover?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.548
Clover isn't waking up
for food?!

01:22.550 --> 01:24.750
Have you been trying long?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.785
Yeah, for a little while.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.188
He usually wakes up
if I just walk in the room
with veggies.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.556
What's wrong?

01:30.558 --> 01:33.759
Oh, no.
It's come to Enchancia.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.893
What has?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.129
The deep sleeps.

01:37.131 --> 01:40.732
It's a mysterious sickness
that makes animals just
fall asleep.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.701
Fall asleep?
For how long?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.603
No one knows
for sure.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.738
Hey, I can't get
Rex to wake up.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.541
Oh, no, he might have
the deep sleeps, too.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.810
I heard Dad say
something about that.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.313
He said there's a fairy
working on a cure,

01:54.315 --> 01:55.714
but he hasn't
found one yet.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.716
I better go check
on the horses.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.120
We have to do something.
It really spreads fast.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.222
- Okay, so...
- ( Whatnaught chittering )

02:03.224 --> 02:05.524
My amulet.
Why is it glowing?

02:06.961 --> 02:08.961
Oh, no.
There she goes again.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.663
I guess it's
up to us to...

02:13.234 --> 02:17.236
Mia! Well, now I guess
it's up to me to...

02:17.238 --> 02:18.871
( snoring )

02:26.647 --> 02:28.847
What happened?

02:28.849 --> 02:30.182
Where are we?

02:30.184 --> 02:31.917
( chittering )

02:31.919 --> 02:34.186
My amulet. You're right,
Whatnaught, it did this
once before.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.822
It sent me to help
Princess Charlotte
to find out why

02:36.824 --> 02:38.657
- she turned into
a hairy beast.
- ( chittering )

02:38.659 --> 02:41.360
We must've been sent here
to help a princess.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.362
But who?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.430
What a strange place.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.666
Is everything
black and white?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.668
( excited chittering )

02:51.372 --> 02:54.573
( gasps )
No. It can't be.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.376
Princess Ivy.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.877
Princess Sofia?!

02:58.879 --> 03:01.113
It wasn't enough
to send me back here?

03:01.115 --> 03:02.848
You had to come
see for yourself?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.883
Your sister banished you,
not me.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.785
It was you, Sofia.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.522
All I wanted
was a kingdom of my own,
but you ruined everything.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.059
By stopping you from
taking over Enchancia?
I had to.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.894
Because of you,
I'm back on

03:15.896 --> 03:17.896
this horribly
colorful island.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.332
So, why are you
even here?

03:20.334 --> 03:22.901
My amulet sent me,
to help a princess.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.338
Well, I certainly don't
want or need your help.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.073
Truth be told, she could
use some help

03:28.075 --> 03:29.541
with her butterflies.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.243
What about
your butterflies?

03:31.245 --> 03:32.678
They're fine.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.246
Why would you even
ask that?

03:34.248 --> 03:36.048
Uh, her butterflies
are missing,

03:36.050 --> 03:38.717
but she's too proud
to admit it.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.918
What do you mean,
they're missing?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.553
How did you know that?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.922
My amulet, it lets me
talk to the animals.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.192
That amulet
is infuriating.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.928
Roma, don't
tell her anything.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.097
You're being
a very bad skunk.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.099
You're the only princess
here, Ivy,

03:54.101 --> 03:55.934
and, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

03:55.936 --> 03:58.770
but I must've been
sent here to help you.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.439
Well, that's a shame,

04:00.441 --> 04:01.573
because I don't want
your help.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.675
I want you
off my island.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.745
Well, that's a shame,
because I can't leave
till I help you,

04:06.747 --> 04:10.382
and I need to leave
so I can help my animal
friends back home.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.451
What's wrong with
the animals?

04:12.453 --> 04:13.785
They have
the deep sleeps.

04:13.787 --> 04:17.189
So, Ivy, you and I
are stuck together

04:17.191 --> 04:19.591
- till I help you.
- ( groans ) Fine.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.027
If it's the only way
to get you to leave,

04:22.029 --> 04:24.396
then yes, my butterflies
are missing.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.797
What happened?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.366
I let them out
this morning

04:27.368 --> 04:29.901
to deal with
that horrid patch of green,

04:29.903 --> 04:33.205
but instead, they flew off,
and now, I can't find them.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.140
I need them back.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.042
Whatnaught, would you
go up in the trees

04:37.044 --> 04:38.977
- and see what you can see?
- ( chittering )

04:47.588 --> 04:48.787
( chittering )

04:48.789 --> 04:49.955
I think he sees...

04:49.957 --> 04:51.590
butterflies,

04:51.592 --> 04:53.759
on the far side
of the island.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.128
Well, I have to go there
and get them back.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.430
You helped,
now you can go away.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.498
Wait, Ivy.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.433
She's really
not so bad.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.402
She's just worried
about her butterflies.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.237
If you say so.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.480
Wow! This is
where Ivy lives?

05:15.482 --> 05:16.982
Yeah.
Pretty nice, huh?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.817
I live here, too.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.752
See, Princess Ivy
took me in when I was hurt.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.188
She fed me,
put a roof over my head,

05:23.190 --> 05:24.956
scratched that part
on the back of my neck

05:24.958 --> 05:26.325
when I couldn't reach
by myself.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.993
I mean it,
she's just swell.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.861
Move out of the way, Roma.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.463
What are you
still doing here, Sofia?

05:31.465 --> 05:34.499
It's not that simple.
I have to really help you,

05:34.501 --> 05:38.270
and isn't that cage
a little small to hold
all those butterflies?

05:38.272 --> 05:40.372
It's enchanted.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.207
It can hold
thousands of butterflies.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.042
Now if you'll
excuse me.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.944
We're coming with you.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.979
The sooner I help you,
the sooner I can go home,

05:47.981 --> 05:49.648
and help my friends.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.383
Ugh, do as you like.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.389
( ferocious growling )

05:57.391 --> 05:58.724
( gasping )

06:00.294 --> 06:02.361
Bear!

06:02.363 --> 06:04.863
Move yourself,
or face the consequences.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.331
( growls )

06:06.333 --> 06:07.933
Don't you growl at me.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.471
No. What are you doing?

06:12.473 --> 06:15.040
This is the only pathway
to the other side of
the island.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.876
I'm going to stun
this bear so I can
get around it.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.811
Now move aside.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.380
Sofia, I'm warning you.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.981
Wait. Wait.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.816
( growls )

06:24.818 --> 06:27.252
Leave me alone,
little girl.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.088
Hi. I'm Sofia.
What's your name?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.991
It's Gruff.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.527
Gruff, my friend thinks
stunning you

06:35.529 --> 06:37.095
is the best way
to get by.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.664
But I think
there's a better way.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.233
I'm hungry,

06:41.235 --> 06:44.703
and I just want to get
to that cake fruit up there.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.172
Oh, is that all?
We can help with that.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.541
How long is this
going to take?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.510
Just a second more.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.078
Whatnaught, will you please
climb up that tree,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.746
and get that cake fruit
for Mr. Gruff?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.648
( chittering )

07:04.558 --> 07:06.892
Oh!

07:06.894 --> 07:08.059
Oh, thank you!

07:08.061 --> 07:09.761
( chewing loudly )

07:09.763 --> 07:11.963
Oh, sweet!

07:11.965 --> 07:14.032
See? You get more flies
with honey.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.034
Ooh, you have honey?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.937
No. It's an expression
my mom taught me.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.572
It means that,
if you're nice,

07:20.574 --> 07:21.606
you'll make more friends.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.141
The bear was just hungry.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.577
Ooh, try some of
this, guys.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.746
It's real good.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.481
Thank you, Mr. Gruff.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.453
Wow, it tastes
just like cake.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.156
Well, I suppose
that's why it's
called cake fruit.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.658
Now can we go?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.893
I just wanna get
my butterflies back.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.296
If you'd have let me
stun that bear...

07:44.298 --> 07:45.831
Wait, look!

07:45.833 --> 07:47.766
There's one of
my butterflies.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.834
It's Aloysius.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.002
Ally. Aloysius.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.971
Come here right now.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.040
( frustrated groan )

07:57.010 --> 08:00.011
Come on. That butterfly
may lead us to the others.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.081
And then, we can
get off this island
and go home.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.090
Oh!

08:12.092 --> 08:14.259
Oh, the color!

08:14.261 --> 08:16.127
Down there.
Can you see them?

08:16.129 --> 08:20.098
But why aren't they
turning the flowers
black and white?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.067
Turn those flowers
black and white!

08:23.804 --> 08:26.271
My lovelies.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.472
Come.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.508
Butterflies.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.809
Come.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.879
I'm not asking,
I'm ordering!

08:33.881 --> 08:36.681
Look. The butterflies
are changing colors.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.321
Oh, no.
It can't be.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.957
Get in this cage
right now, please.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.093
Come on, Whatnaught.
We're supposed to help.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.569
Butterflies, follow me.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.914
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

09:08.916 --> 09:11.149
Oh, finally,
you're back.
Ta-da!

09:11.151 --> 09:13.084
( sighs )

09:13.086 --> 09:15.320
I suppose I should
thank you, Sofia.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.556
Using the flower
that way was clever.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.991
I suppose you're welcome.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.227
Whatnaught, I think
that means we're done here.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.462
The amulet should
send us home now.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.066
Nice to meet you, Roma.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.734
We have to get home
and help our friends.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.002
Good luck.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.272
And here we go.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.576
Here... we go.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.145
Any minute now.

09:41.548 --> 09:44.082
Oh, come on.
Send me home.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.284
I have to help my friends.
Come on!

09:46.286 --> 09:47.586
Why are you
still here?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.187
I don't know.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.556
It should've sent me home
as soon as I helped you.

09:51.558 --> 09:54.192
So what am I
supposed to do now?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.628
Uh, yes, see,
that's what I call

09:56.630 --> 09:58.730
a "not me" problem,

09:58.732 --> 10:01.199
which is another way of saying
it's your problem.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.767
My sweet butterflies.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.470
I'm never letting you
out of my sight again.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.872
Bye, Princess Sofia.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.240
Good luck!

10:09.242 --> 10:11.109
( sighs )

10:11.111 --> 10:13.578
The amulet sent us here,
we helped a princess,

10:13.580 --> 10:15.547
so what am I missing?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.216
( gasps )

10:21.288 --> 10:22.954
( snoring )

10:22.956 --> 10:25.156
Hey, I saw this guy earlier.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.993
Oh, no. The deep sleeps
are here?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.433
Princess Sofia?

10:35.435 --> 10:38.737
Miss Nettle?
I can't believe
you're here.

10:38.739 --> 10:42.440
You were in Freezenberg,
tending to your nettle drops.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.910
That's right, and now,
I'm tending to these beauties.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.146
Why are you here,
dear princess?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.581
My amulet sent me.

10:49.583 --> 10:50.682
Oh?

10:50.684 --> 10:53.084
Did it send you to admire

10:53.086 --> 10:55.153
my soon-to-be renown
Wake Upsy daisy?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.455
It's my greatest
creation.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.859
My Wake Upsy daisy
cures the deep sleeps.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.460
These cure
the deep sleeps?

11:02.462 --> 11:04.129
Yes, they do indeed.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.265
You're the fairy they said
was working on a cure?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.500
Yes, I am.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.603
Oh, I'm so glad
you've decided to be good.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.506
Yes. Good and famous.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.142
Well, as long as it cures
the deep sleeps,

11:17.144 --> 11:18.943
because look,
it's here now.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.211
( snoring )

11:20.213 --> 11:23.081
Observe.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.522
Amazing!

11:30.524 --> 11:32.557
Oh, it's amazing,
all right.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.727
But where are
my butterflies?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.195
Your butterflies?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.563
I didn't pick this island

11:38.565 --> 11:40.565
out of all the islands
in the Ever Realm

11:40.567 --> 11:42.267
just for the climate.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.406
Oh, no, the flowers
are wilting.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.208
They need the magic
of those butterflies

11:50.210 --> 11:52.410
to bloom.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.812
Where did they go?

11:53.814 --> 11:56.915
- Princess Ivy
took them.
- Who?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.983
Princess Ivy. She lives
on the other side of
the island.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.152
But the butterflies
belong to her.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.355
I thought my amulet sent me
here to help her get them back.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.691
But it must've sent me
for something else.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.260
Well, of course,
it's something else,

12:09.262 --> 12:12.697
because no butterflies,
no cure.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.232
Then we have
to get them back.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.101
I'm coming with you.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.839
It's all
black and white.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.108
Strangest thing
I've ever seen.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.111
And I've seen
some pretty strange things.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.213
Ivy doesn't like color.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.447
Wait here.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.452
Are you still here?

12:34.454 --> 12:37.255
Oh, what is that hideous
splotch of color?

12:37.257 --> 12:40.725
That's Miss Nettle,
a very well-known
enchanted gardener.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.694
How wonderful for her.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.063
But I don't see what
this has to do with me,

12:45.065 --> 12:46.965
so I will say good-bye.
Good-bye.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.400
The butterflies were helping
Miss Nettles' flowers grow.

12:49.402 --> 12:53.304
Without them, my beautiful
flowers will die.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.807
And the flowers
are the cure for
the deep sleeps.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.575
Why would I care
about that?

12:57.577 --> 12:59.711
It's come here,
to your island.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.981
Soon, all the animals
on the island will be asleep.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.550
- You have to help.
- ( chittering )

13:05.552 --> 13:07.051
Oh, no.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.124
Oh, the deep sleeps.

13:13.126 --> 13:17.662
But we can't cure it until
someone shares her butterflies.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.266
And someone keeps trying
to make this my problem.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.268
Princess Ivy,
you have to help us.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.838
This is my island,
and I don't have to do anything.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.309
What are we
going to do?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.511
If she won't
give them to us,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.780
we'll just have to
take the butterflies.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.982
But they don't
belong to us.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.852
Don't you want to help
your little squirrel friend?

13:40.854 --> 13:43.154
Of course.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.490
He wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for me.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.528
We don't have
to take the butterflies.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.031
What if we just
set them free?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.699
Right, yes!

13:54.701 --> 13:56.334
For a good cause.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.369
Don't ruin this
for me.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.506
I don't see anything.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.341
How are we going
to get inside?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.788
Okay, I'm in.

14:16.790 --> 14:19.524
Now where are those...

14:25.632 --> 14:26.798
( door closes )

14:28.535 --> 14:31.870
That was close.
Okay, send me down.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.980
What are you doing?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.249
We're trying to help
Whatnaught.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.252
Oh, okay.
Follow me then.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.088
You're gonna need
Ivy's butterflies.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.794
Thank you, Roma.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.505
Feeding time,
my lovelies.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.408
My butterflies.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.676
No!

15:13.079 --> 15:17.081
It was Sofia and that...
that gardener.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.717
Did you help them?

15:19.719 --> 15:22.620
What? After
I took you in,

15:22.622 --> 15:24.856
gave you a warm bed,
fed you?

15:24.858 --> 15:27.525
I thought you
were on my side,
but you're not.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.594
You are a bad skunk.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.896
I am on your side,
Miss Ivy.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.331
Wait.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.105
Oh, no. Mr. Gruff
has the deep sleeps, too.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.974
We need to hurry.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.413
The flowers look terrible.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.714
It's all right.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.484
They just need
the magic of
the butterflies.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.553
( loud buzzing )

15:56.456 --> 15:58.923
Shoo, shoo,
dragonflies!

15:58.925 --> 16:01.626
Ivy, we just need
the butterflies
for a little while.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.129
No, Sofia.
Get them back in
the cage right now,

16:05.131 --> 16:08.566
or I'll send
my dragonflies
after you, too.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.335
What's going on?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.645
I'm sorry, Sofia,
but Ivy takes care of me.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.413
I owe her this.
Bye.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.549
Dragonflies, come.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.588
Oh, Roma,
thank you so much.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.157
I'm sorry I yelled
at you earlier,

16:33.159 --> 16:34.525
but... Roma?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.496
Roma?

16:38.498 --> 16:39.964
No. No, no, no.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.166
It's the deep sleeps.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.702
But how long
will be be asleep?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.437
I don't know.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.281
Oh. Oh, what...

16:57.283 --> 16:59.050
Why... why is my face wet?

16:59.052 --> 17:01.486
Well, you're crying.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.388
I'm... I'm what?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.690
What is this lump
in my throat?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.358
What's going on here?

17:07.360 --> 17:11.462
¶ Why's a tear
running down from my eye ¶

17:11.464 --> 17:15.199
¶ I've never felt
quite like this before ¶

17:15.201 --> 17:19.137
¶ And I don't know why
it makes me cry ¶

17:19.139 --> 17:25.743
¶ To think he might sleep
forever-more ¶

17:25.745 --> 17:29.914
¶ Oh, what is this
I'm feeling? ¶

17:29.916 --> 17:33.551
¶ What is this ache
inside of me? ¶

17:33.553 --> 17:36.387
¶ Everything is reeling ¶

17:36.389 --> 17:38.022
¶ Through these misty eyes ¶

17:38.024 --> 17:42.160
¶ I just can't see ¶

17:42.162 --> 17:49.767
¶ What is this feeling
I'm feeling in me? ¶

17:49.769 --> 17:52.770
¶ You are feeling this way
'cause you care ¶

17:52.772 --> 17:55.573
¶ That's why it seems like
your world may end ¶

17:55.575 --> 17:59.110
¶ It feels new,
but you shouldn't be scared ¶

17:59.112 --> 18:02.213
¶ You're aching because ¶

18:02.215 --> 18:05.416
¶ You miss your best friend ¶

18:05.418 --> 18:09.020
¶ Oh, I know how
you're feeling ¶

18:09.022 --> 18:12.557
¶ Losing a friend
will make you blue ¶

18:12.559 --> 18:15.460
¶ So help us with his healing ¶

18:15.462 --> 18:21.065
¶ And you'll feel
a whole lot better too ¶

18:21.067 --> 18:27.405
¶ Embrace the feeling
you're feeling in you ¶

18:27.407 --> 18:30.608
¶ In your
black-and-white world ¶

18:30.610 --> 18:34.112
¶ You can no longer hide ¶

18:34.114 --> 18:36.547
¶ If you care for
your friend ¶

18:36.549 --> 18:41.285
¶ Won't you please
let some color inside? ¶

18:41.287 --> 18:48.426
¶ At least won't you try? ¶

18:48.428 --> 18:51.329
¶ I'll embrace this feeling ¶

18:51.331 --> 18:54.765
¶ Let go of the way
I used to be ¶

18:54.767 --> 18:59.804
¶ Friendship is revealing,
and it makes me see ¶

18:59.806 --> 19:03.808
¶ A brand-new me ¶

19:03.810 --> 19:07.745
¶ I like this feeling
I'm feeling ¶

19:07.747 --> 19:10.848
¶ I know the feeling
you're speaking of ¶

19:10.850 --> 19:17.288
¶ The feeling that
you're feeling ¶

19:17.290 --> 19:25.930
¶ Is love ¶

19:29.302 --> 19:32.036
Now I understand why
you let the butterflies go.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.804
This feeling.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.041
Yes. I was worried
about Whatnaught
and the other animals.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.776
Like Roma?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.278
I thought it wasn't
my problem,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.547
but I care about Roma.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.916
So his problem
is your problem.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.055
Go! Go quickly!
We have to help Roma!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.047
For the squirrel, Sofia.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.683
He's been asleep
the longest.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.785
Thank you, Ivy.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.826
It's okay, Whatnaught.
Ivy's helping us now.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.868
Whoa... what?
Where am I?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.270
Oh, it worked!

20:39.272 --> 20:41.739
Welcome back,
my little stink bomb.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.908
I'm so glad
you're all better.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.710
Well, what are
we waiting for?

20:45.712 --> 20:48.446
We have a whole island
full of animals to cure.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.921
I would like to...

20:56.923 --> 20:59.357
apologize to you, Sofia.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.293
You see, I never had
a friend before Roma,

21:02.295 --> 21:03.861
so I never knew
how it would feel

21:03.863 --> 21:05.763
when they were in trouble.

21:05.765 --> 21:09.233
Now I'm going to help
Miss Nettle with her
Wake Upsy daisies.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.135
Oh, it made me feel
so good to help him.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.571
But what about
the color?

21:13.573 --> 21:16.440
Oh, look. Miss Nettle
made these for me.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.744
Miss Nettle, have
you two become friends?

21:19.746 --> 21:22.113
Don't make
a big deal out of it,

21:22.115 --> 21:25.383
but yes, I suppose
we are.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.052
( whispering )

21:28.054 --> 21:30.588
Ivy, I think the animals
made something for you,

21:30.590 --> 21:32.490
to say thanks.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.964
It's... beautiful.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.733
All I wanted
was a kingdom of my own,

21:42.735 --> 21:45.970
but I guess I had one
all along.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.938
Even better,
you have friends.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.141
Maybe that's why
the amulet sent me.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.009
To help you see that.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.111
Look. Time to go,
Whatnaught.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.780
Thank you, Sofia.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.948
Good luck... again.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.784
So long, princess.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.218
Bye, everyone.

22:06.459 --> 22:09.327
( snoring )

22:28.848 --> 22:31.315
- He's fine.
- Totally fine.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.451
Oh, Clover.
