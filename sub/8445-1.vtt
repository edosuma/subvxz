03:15.112 --> 03:18.525
Oh, my God! The Kothoga.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.661
Captain! Captain!

04:21.386 --> 04:24.423
Captain, my crates.
Have you loaded my crates?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.300
They can't go. They have to come off.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.928
-Who the hell are you?
-My name is John Whitney.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.102
The crates, they're consigned
to the Natural History Museum in Chicago.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.931
-Just tell me if they're onboard.
-Crates is all we have onboard, señor.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.483
No, they have to come off.
This is extremely important.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.649
Nothing comes off after customs
has been on, señor.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.779
-That's more important.
-Look. Look, I'll take care of you, all right?

04:45.869 --> 04:49.828
If you'll just get the manifest.
The Natural History Museum in Chicago.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.076
-Please, compadre.
-I don't have time for this.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.204
I have to get my ship out of the harbor.
I'm eight hours late,

04:55.295 --> 04:56.751
and there's weather coming in.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.295
Don't worry, señor.
We'll take good care of your crates.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.734
Morning, Lieutenant.
Coast Guard found it early this morning.

07:26.821 --> 07:30.109
Don't really know how long it's been there
or how it got there.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.816
-What are those?
-The old coal tunnels.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.870
There was a time when 30 coal barges a day
would come into this slip.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.118
I'm touched. Who the hell is onboard?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.245
-Hollingsworth.
-Wonderful.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.296
Morning, Lieutenant.
Just been to the front of the boat.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.998
I got something to show you.

07:48.093 --> 07:52.507
It's a ship, Hollingsworth, not a boat.
And the pointy end is the bow.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.297
Custody hearing went badly?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.549
I don't wanna talk about it.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.308
She got Jerry?

08:00.563 --> 08:04.101
What part of "I don't want to talk about it"
is unclear?

08:04.192 --> 08:07.730
-Oh, shit.
-His ex-wife got custody of his son?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.812
-His dog.
-His dog?

08:11.116 --> 08:13.448
Yeah, he really loves that dog.

08:15.412 --> 08:19.451
The ship's registered out of Brazil.
Came down through the seaway.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.406
Paperwork looks legit.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.422
It's blood. Lab's checking it for type.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.256
-Any bodies?
-Nope. Not a one.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.383
When the Coast Guard found it,

08:36.474 --> 08:38.385
it was floundering
in the middle of Lake Michigan.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.842
So they towed it in, and nobody knows
how long it had been like that.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.179
-You checked the manifest?
-We're doing it now.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.520
-Bring in the dogs?
-The drug unit's been over the whole thing.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.695
I told them it was a waste of time.
I mean, this was obviously a drug hit.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.444
Whatever they came for, they found.

08:55.994 --> 08:59.953
Now, I figure they came aboard at night,
they killed everyone,

09:00.248 --> 09:02.489
and they threw the bodies overboard.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.200
You figured all that out by yourself?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.002
-Holy shit!
-What?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.710
-What?
-Cat. Nearly gave me a heart attack.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.292
-Was it a black cat?
-No.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.805
What's that smell?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.678
-Is the bilge below here?
-I think so.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.933
Give me that.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.647
Give me a hand here.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.226
What a stink!

09:40.121 --> 09:41.702
Jesus Christ.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.173
Let's all stay together.

10:01.726 --> 10:06.345
Please walk! Walk! Walk, children. Walk!

10:06.523 --> 10:11.438
Walk. Please, walk. Walk.
Let's all stay together.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.644
-I say we go.
-Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.354
We finally cut school
and you wanna go to a museum.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.280
Maybe afterwards we could go to a library.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.656
They've got mummies in there,
eyeballs in jars, dead stuff.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.611
See, man, I don't know about this stuff.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.665
Look, we can go in with them,
check it out, split.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.289
I mean, we can't go
to an arcade yet anyway.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.665
We'd be noticed.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.873
-So, what are you, scared?
-No, I'm not scared!

10:47.897 --> 10:50.013
Hey, didn't your parents teach you
not to stare?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.645
Didn't yours teach you
not to get dressed in the street?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.317
-Good morning, Dr. Green.
-Good morning.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.817
-Doctor?
-What kind of a doctor are you?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.239
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.737
What's that?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.820
Someone trying to figure out
where our tails went.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.654
Your teacher's gonna be looking for you.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.785
Oh, yeah. Come on, Eugene.

11:09.711 --> 11:15.707
Kids, do not run. Walk. Walk. Easy.
Do not run, walk.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.301
Walk, kids. Walk.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.047
-Walk.
-Good morning, Dr. Green.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.349
-Good morning, Fred.
-These kids are driving me crazy.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.269
Careful. They're our future benefactors.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.772
Margo, I need to speak with you
about your grant.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.695
-You've heard already?
-I've heard something.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.488
-I didn't get it.
-No. It's not that bad.

11:41.576 --> 11:45.945
It's just that the Blaisedale Foundation
has decided to delay their decision.

11:46.039 --> 11:51.659
-Delay? Why?
-Greg Lee is applying for the same grant.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.330
Greg?

11:54.797 --> 11:58.164
-I thought he had his grant.
-Well, he's going after another one.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.466
Can he do that? Another one?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.841
I mean, doesn't he realize
that I have to shut down my work

12:03.932 --> 12:08.050
-if I don't get that money?
-I don't suppose he's thought about that.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.311
-Slimy.
-Margo, have a little faith in yourself.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.763
-You're better than he is.
-Faith?

12:14.192 --> 12:17.776
Come on. It's not the end of the world.
It's just a little competition.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.274
You've got the gala coming up
night after next,

12:20.365 --> 12:22.401
and the Blaisedales are going to be here.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.574
-You know? The Blaisedales.
-Yes.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.403
So put on your party dress,
and I'll introduce you,

12:27.497 --> 12:30.910
and you show them just how bright you are.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.991
I just wanna do my work.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.002
You know, Greg will be there,

12:36.089 --> 12:39.581
attaching himself to the Blaisedales
like a crustacean.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.672
Donna, did you get the gecko
and lizard samples loaded?

12:47.767 --> 12:50.133
It's through the replicator.
We got a big sample.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.061
Great. Hey, Charlie.
Did we get the database back online?

12:53.147 --> 12:55.763
-It's online, but I don't know for how long.
-Good.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.895
-Hello, Greg. How nice to see you!
-Margo.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.188
-How's the old research going?
-Fine. I'm just a little bit busy.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.195
Could there be anything special
that you'd like to tell me?

13:06.286 --> 13:09.653
Of course not. 'Cause if there was,
you would've just come out and told me.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.829
I have every right to apply for any grant.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.079
So you go behind my back
and apply for my grant?

13:15.545 --> 13:19.129
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-It's not your grant until you get it.

13:19.215 --> 13:23.003
If I don't get it, I'm out of work.
My staff is out of work.

13:23.553 --> 13:27.512
-You shouldn't take it so personally.
-You really are a gerbil.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.538
Margo. Well, this is a surprise.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.837
-I was just... I thought...
-I asked Margo to join us, Ann.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.757
-I hope you don't mind.
-Oh, no. Of course not.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.756
No word from John yet,
but these crates arrived this morning.

14:07.847 --> 14:12.386
They were supposed to be on a ship
except there was some mix-up in Brazil,

14:12.477 --> 14:15.184
and they never made it.
They were sent by air freight.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.387
Here, here. Take a look at this.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.144
-The Kothoga.
-Could be.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.271
And what does this god specialize in?

14:22.362 --> 14:26.526
South American tribe, the Zenzera,
long thought to be extinct.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.949
They made a deal with Satan
to vanquish their enemies.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.992
So, Kothoga was born, son of Satan.
You have that look again, Margo.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.699
Why do we keep financing
John Whitney's expeditions,

14:37.794 --> 14:39.705
as if superstition
were the same thing as science?

14:39.796 --> 14:43.789
Anthropologists are permitted
to believe in myth. It's part of their job.

14:43.883 --> 14:48.502
In any case, our superstition exhibit
is excellent box office for this museum,

14:48.596 --> 14:50.211
and that benefits you, as well.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.922
Using superstition
to bring people to the museum

14:53.017 --> 14:56.259
is like hiring topless ushers
for the Bolshoi Ballet.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.436
Well, if they did, I might go to the ballet.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.606
Do you really think the restoration
department can do something with this?

15:01.692 --> 15:04.229
Certainly. Possibly even for the opening.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.526
What was in this other crate?

15:05.613 --> 15:07.945
Except for the packing leaves, it was empty.

15:08.032 --> 15:12.116
Empty? Well, was there a packing list?
There must've been something in here.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.070
Crates were nailed shut when they arrived.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.412
-Strange.
-What?

15:21.879 --> 15:24.040
Do you think these are eggs?

15:24.715 --> 15:30.005
More like fungus. Probably parasitical.
Best not to take any chances.

15:30.555 --> 15:34.844
Quite right. Let's see to having those leaves
and crates incinerated.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.145
Of course you can, Margo.

15:55.788 --> 16:01.033
Attention, please. The museum
will be closing in 1 5 minutes. Thank you.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.513
Hey, man, this stuff is so cool.

16:20.605 --> 16:25.065
-I don't think we're supposed to be here.
-Don't be such a wuss, Eugene.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.193
Attention, please.
The museum is now closed.

16:30.573 --> 16:34.566
Attention, please.
The museum is now closed.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.825
We're gonna get in big trouble.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.871
What do you think they're gonna do?
Put us in the museum jail?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.959
Johnson? Davis? That you?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.764
Dr. Green, I've worked myself to the bone.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.264
Please let me go home. I need to rest.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.850
All right, you guys.
You can finish tomorrow morning.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.147
Go on. Take a hike.

18:41.746 --> 18:46.206
Why don't we just start yelling?
Someone will show us the way out of here.

18:48.169 --> 18:52.583
And call our moms and let them know
that we cut class.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.538
Great idea, butt wipe.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.127
Hey, man, there's a really cool
staircase back here.

19:00.222 --> 19:04.056
-No, let's just get out of here.
-What are you, scared?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.661
Hello? Is someone there?

19:42.348 --> 19:46.261
Josh? Josh, where are you?

19:48.604 --> 19:49.764
Josh.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.314
Josh, come on. This isn't funny.

20:02.118 --> 20:05.326
-You goofball. You almost wet your pants.
-Josh.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.949
Quiet. Do you hear something?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.576
-What is it?
-I don't know.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.581
-Let's just go.
-Yeah.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.094
-You smell something?
-You farted, didn't you?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.053
No, not lately.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.106
Let's get out of here.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.247
That's terrific.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.920
Hang on to your fucking hat, Lieutenant.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.920
I want to interview every employee
whether they worked yesterday or not.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.844
If they did work, I want the hours,
what part of the building,

21:04.930 --> 21:07.216
if they saw the victim, what time and where.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.594
Who was the last person
to leave the building yesterday?

21:09.685 --> 21:13.223
-A Dr. Green.
-Good. I wanna talk to him.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.773
-Did you hear?
-No.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.569
-I'm guessing you're gonna tell me.
-Someone's been killed.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.319
-Murder.
-Oh, my God.

21:26.577 --> 21:30.536
They're not telling us who. All I know is
they cut off the whole basement level.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.738
Murdered?

21:31.832 --> 21:35.074
I'm betting it was Colonel Mustard
with a candlestick.

21:36.921 --> 21:41.381
What? What are you thinking?
You think I'm an asshole, right? Is that it?

21:42.176 --> 21:44.292
-Are you Dr. Green?
-Yes, I am.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.718
Could you come with me, please?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.967
-It's okay, honey.
-I understand...

21:49.058 --> 21:52.266
-It's gonna be all right.
-All right, that's good. All right.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.186
Take them both to the 1 5th.
I want detailed statements

21:55.272 --> 21:57.103
in the presence of a psychologist.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.182
Museum security wants to know
if they can open the doors.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.312
No. Check to see
if they got anything on video.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.394
I did that, sir. They don't have
surveillance cameras down here.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.526
-Can I help you?
-Lieutenant D'Agosta wants to see me.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.074
-He does?
-This is Dr. Green.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.661
Yeah. Dr. Green, I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.
I wanted to ask you some questions,

22:12.748 --> 22:15.239
but I'm fresh on the scene here.
Can I find you later?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.870
-Can I go to my lab?
-Not yet.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.327
We'll clear the work areas
as soon as we can.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.913
-What am I supposed to do?
-Enjoying your mochas, gentlemen?

22:23.425 --> 22:25.586
-The smell!
-Take it outside, Martini.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.293
I'm okay. I'm okay.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.473
-This look familiar to you?
-Yep.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.435
This is not good.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.689
Never thought there was a worse way to die
than a shark attack.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.320
Having my head ripped off
never occurred to me.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.652
-Where is his head?
-It's over there by the sink.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.453
Lieutenant D'Agosta... Oh, my God!

22:56.584 --> 22:58.324
Get her out of here.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.289
Lieutenant, over here.

23:02.089 --> 23:06.128
No, don't step over it. It's bad luck.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.675
Jesus Christ.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.969
There's a half-burnt joint on the floor.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.798
Seems our boy was having
a little pot on the potty.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.557
Pot's a misdemeanor.
Decapitation seems a bit severe.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.188
I want the blood on the walls.
Get a ballistic analysis.

23:25.738 --> 23:29.651
Pinpoint source, speed, force,
full splatter pattern.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.153
Sweep in teams of two.
Nobody goes in alone.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.161
This place is not gonna open
until every room is clear. Now, go.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.666
Now, the question is,
what does a museum guard

23:44.757 --> 23:47.749
have to do with a drug hit
on a South American ship?

23:47.843 --> 23:50.550
-I don't know.
-The answer is, maybe nothing.

23:56.352 --> 24:01.096
Dr. Cuthbert. Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta,
Chicago homicide.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.940
Lieutenant, this is Tom Parkinson,
our director of security.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.393
Have you identified the victim,
Lieutenant Augustino?

24:07.488 --> 24:08.728
D'Agosta.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.029
Victim's name is Frederick Ford.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.483
Freddy Ford? What a terrible, terrible thing.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.320
Yeah. I'd say
somebody was really pissed off at him.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.745
Any thoughts on who that might be?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.539
No. He was a very sweet man.
I have no idea.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.662
I hardly knew the guy.

24:22.753 --> 24:26.666
Lieutenant, I don't mean to downplay
the horror of this tragedy

24:26.757 --> 24:30.466
or the urgency of your investigation,
but what about the museum?

24:30.552 --> 24:32.088
I'm going to do this in layers.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.591
You'll be allowed in your offices
once we've been through the building

24:34.682 --> 24:36.263
and determined that there is no danger.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.716
But what about our exhibition space?
When will that open?

24:38.811 --> 24:41.598
We have a major exhibit about to open.

24:41.689 --> 24:45.056
The board is hosting a gala preview
here tomorrow night.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.015
It's so vital to us.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.689
I can't tell you exactly when.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.738
Lieutenant, we've invested so much in this.

24:52.825 --> 24:56.033
It would be a disaster for us
if we had to postpone.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.988
We're checking your offices and labs first
so you people can go back, do your work.

25:00.082 --> 25:03.540
It won't take long. Now,
as far as the areas open to the public,

25:03.627 --> 25:04.742
we may have somebody on our hands

25:04.837 --> 25:07.374
who makes Jeffery Dahmer
look like a Cub Scout,

25:07.464 --> 25:10.080
and I've got to be sure he's not here.

25:27.317 --> 25:31.151
Dr. Green.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.649
Okay.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.484
-What's that stuff you were looking at?
-DNA strands.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.991
Did you come all the way down here
to learn about DNA?

25:41.081 --> 25:42.161
No.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.241
I hope you don't mind walking.
I have to return these samples.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.496
Well, if I get tired, I'll let you know.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.625
-What's the soup today?
-Rhinoceros megarhinus.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.461
He's making rhinoceros soup?

25:53.969 --> 25:57.382
It's a maceration tank.
Skin them, toss them in the warm water,

25:57.473 --> 26:00.215
wait until the meat and flesh fall off,
and then give them to the beetles.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.674
Beetles as in bug beetles?

26:02.811 --> 26:05.143
Domestic beetles are
a fairly common insect.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.222
They eat the flesh off almost anything.
They pick the bones clean.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.729
Better watch yourself.
Someone left the glass case open last night

26:10.819 --> 26:11.854
and a bunch hit the highway.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.776
Well, they know better
than to head for the cafeteria.

26:13.864 --> 26:17.322
I'm sorry you had to see all that
at the crime scene.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.905
I said hello to that man every day
for the past six years.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.328
You could have closed the door.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.073
-Did you know him well?
-No.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.535
Wait.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.126
-Is it face up?
-Down.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.753
Don't touch it. Face down's bad luck.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.426
Don't tell me you're superstitious.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.676
Sorry, but around here, every penny counts.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.804
What the hell's all this?

26:44.895 --> 26:47.682
This is one of six storage areas
for the collection.

26:47.773 --> 26:51.265
The museum has something
like 3 million specimens.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.477
Exhibition areas only show about 2%
of what the museum owns.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.857
It doesn't look like a good place
to light a match.

26:57.533 --> 27:01.742
According to museum security,
you were the last one to leave last night.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.492
-Did you see or hear anything strange?
-No.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.997
Well, I thought I heard something
as I was leaving,

27:08.085 --> 27:10.747
but it could have been anything. I was tired.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.329
What can you tell me about John Whitney?
You know him?

27:13.423 --> 27:17.166
-Unfortunately.
-His office was vandalized last night.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.381
Sir.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.387
Wow.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.178
Do you have any idea
what might have been in this office

27:25.269 --> 27:26.805
that someone would want so damn bad?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.853
I have no idea why anyone would want
anything of John Whitney's.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.147
But I've been told
mine's a subjective opinion.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.067
You ever see John Whitney with Fred Ford?
Were they friends?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.189
No.

27:37.030 --> 27:40.648
-Does John Whitney use or sell drugs?
-I don't think so.

27:41.285 --> 27:45.574
John Whitney's not in Brazil
shipping drugs, just insignificant relics.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.740
-Brazil?
-Yeah, a couple of crates came in yesterday.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.541
-What was in them?
-One had a smashed relic.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.084
The other was empty.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.629
-So there was nothing inside?
-That's what empty means.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.964
-Could it have been pried open?
-It was nailed shut.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.666
Could it have been pried open
and then nailed shut?

27:59.761 --> 28:02.844
I suppose so. What are you suggesting?
That there were drugs in the crate?

28:02.931 --> 28:05.673
I don't suggest. Where are those crates?

28:06.143 --> 28:09.476
They were burned,
but the relic's in the restoration department.

28:14.276 --> 28:17.359
Perri Masai, our restorative genius,
Lieutenant D'Agosta.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.401
Hi.

28:18.488 --> 28:22.072
Well, this is John Whitney's relic
or what's left of it.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.068
-Any idea what it looks like?
-With black stone, it's difficult.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.027
It's a chimera of some kind.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.829
-What's a chimera?
-It's a combination of creatures

28:29.917 --> 28:33.284
that superstitious people
see as god or enemy.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.461
What kind of superstitious people?

28:40.177 --> 28:42.714
Here's my card.
If you think of anything else...

28:42.804 --> 28:44.340
You're welcome.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.643
Lieutenant D'Agosta,

28:51.730 --> 28:56.064
it's lovely to see you
under such alarming circumstances.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.068
Seven decapitations in one week.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.443
Don't you just hate someone
who only takes head and never gives it?

29:03.533 --> 29:05.319
You're bad, Matilda, real bad.

29:05.410 --> 29:09.449
Autopsy attended by Lieutenant Vincent
D'Agosta, Chicago homicide.

29:09.831 --> 29:13.744
-I heard your ex got custody of the dog.
-What, it's on the goddamn Internet?

29:13.835 --> 29:17.168
You shouldn't have been late
on your Alpo payments.

29:18.757 --> 29:23.046
We have an African American male,
probably age 55 to 60.

29:23.136 --> 29:27.004
Height, 5'4", with his head, maybe 6'1 ".

29:27.099 --> 29:30.808
Weight, 1 60, give or take,
if you know what I mean.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.427
There are an undetermined
number of lacerations

29:33.522 --> 29:37.310
preceding from the left anterior pectoral
region downward through the sternum,

29:37.401 --> 29:40.518
terminating at the right
anterior abdominal region.

29:40.696 --> 29:44.405
The pectoralis minor and pectoralis major
are separated to a great degree.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.277
And there is spontaneous dehiscence.

29:46.368 --> 29:50.702
The sternal process has been split
and the rib cage exposed.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.373
Now for the head. The head is decapitated

29:54.543 --> 29:57.376
between the axial process and the atlas.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.954
The entire occipital portion of the calvarium

30:01.049 --> 30:03.506
and half the parietal process
has been crushed

30:03.593 --> 30:06.801
or rather seemingly punched through
and removed,

30:07.139 --> 30:10.256
Ieaving a hole perhaps 5 inches in diameter.

30:10.726 --> 30:14.719
The skull is empty.
The entire brain appears to have fallen out

30:14.813 --> 30:17.475
or been extracted through this hole.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.229
-Any idea about a weapon?
-Something big.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.103
The brain is severely traumatized

30:25.198 --> 30:28.235
and appears to have been severed
at the medulla oblongata.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.488
The pons Varolii is intact but separate.

30:30.579 --> 30:34.242
The cerebrum has been completely severed
from the mesencephalon.

30:34.333 --> 30:39.623
And... Hey. Hey, wait a minute,
this brain's light, even for a man.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.672
Something's missing, Lieutenant.
Where's the rest of it?

30:43.759 --> 30:47.468
-You got everything we found.
-There is no thalamic region.

30:48.096 --> 30:52.055
-There is no pituitary gland.
-What are you talking about?

30:52.142 --> 30:56.761
The thalamus and hypothalamus
regulate body temperature, blood pressure,

30:56.855 --> 31:01.349
heartbeat, it regulates hundreds
of hormones into the bloodstream.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.559
-Don't you agree, Fred?
-Yes.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.940
He never shuts up.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.132
That was fast.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.967
Glycotetraline collagenoid,
Weinstein's thyrotropic hormone.

31:37.229 --> 31:42.940
Tenascin, oxytocin, monoxytocin,
suppressive hormones.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.694
This fungus is loaded with hormones,
animal hormones.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.854
What kind of fungus is this?

32:02.671 --> 32:05.913
Hollingsworth, I hope
I'm interrupting your dinner.

32:06.007 --> 32:09.750
Listen, dig up whatever records
we have on those bodies from the ship.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.251
If there were any autopsies done,

32:11.346 --> 32:14.964
check and see if any part of the brain
was missing from any of the heads.

32:15.058 --> 32:19.097
I don't care how long it takes.
Hey, let me ask you something.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.020
How the fuck does somebody
get custody of a dog?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.482
-Good night.
-Good night, ma'am.

36:24.683 --> 36:28.175
-Morning, Lieutenant.
-Pretty fancy.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.515
It only took seven months planning.

36:32.649 --> 36:35.561
You know, I really hope
you can have your party tonight.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.358
So do I.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.187
We may have a majorly crazy person
somewhere in this building

36:40.281 --> 36:43.023
and I don't think you'd want him
showing up tonight.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.074
No, we can't have that.

36:47.497 --> 36:50.284
-This is a big deal, isn't it?
-Very big.

36:50.792 --> 36:55.035
-This party will raise a lot of money, right?
-A lot of money. Very high profile.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.714
The Mayor is coming, the media,
big companies that give lots of grants,

36:58.800 --> 37:02.133
-limousines, the whole schmeer.
-Tell you what, we'll find this guy

37:02.220 --> 37:03.756
so you can have your party.

37:03.847 --> 37:08.090
Lieutenant, do you like smoked salmon
on those little round toasty things?

37:08.184 --> 37:11.267
-I don't think I've ever had it.
-Well, if you don't catch your man,

37:11.354 --> 37:14.312
there's going to be about 300 pounds of it.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.402
Yeah, but have you tried
the lattes with the whole milk?

37:25.577 --> 37:29.490
-Very smooth.
-I like espresso. Forget smooth.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.405
-What the fuck do you know?
-I know I like espresso.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.116
-Yeah, but have you tried lattes?
-No.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.704
There's supposed to be a door
around here someplace.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.837
Here it is. Here it is.

37:48.558 --> 37:49.718
Jesus.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.978
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

38:00.153 --> 38:02.644
I don't know where the hell we are.

38:03.990 --> 38:07.027
Maybe I'm reading this map wrong,
I don't know.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.026
Hey! Hey! Look at this!

38:11.247 --> 38:12.282
Jesus.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.825
Is that a footprint?

38:18.129 --> 38:21.713
-He's got to be over 7 feet tall.
-Looks like blood.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.083
I think it is blood.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.184
Good morning, Lieutenant.
How are you today?

38:39.526 --> 38:41.892
-What have you got?
-Right.

38:43.571 --> 38:47.985
-Well, we checked on that hypo...
-Hypothalamus.

38:48.993 --> 38:52.952
Right. Anyway, what heads we were able

38:53.039 --> 38:56.372
to salvage from the Santos Morales
were pretty decomposed.

38:57.210 --> 39:01.544
But they were all missing
their hypothalamuses.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.965
Why thank you, Hollingsworth.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.914
It's the consistent repetition
of sequences of three

39:42.005 --> 39:46.089
that are unique to each individual.
But before you begin DNA testing,

39:46.175 --> 39:48.757
you have to be able
to identify the specimen.

39:48.845 --> 39:51.052
With your financial grant,

39:51.139 --> 39:55.633
the complicated, tedious task
of specimen identification

39:55.810 --> 39:59.803
will become a quick,
certain, analytical technique.

40:02.817 --> 40:06.856
Procedure. Mode?. System.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.482
Just give me the goddamn money. Shit.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.737
One of the kids i n your lab told me
where to find you.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.995
Well, I was just rehearsing.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.495
-You were really good.
-Y eah. Right.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.170
Really good ending.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.794
Hey! Hold on.

40:34.474 --> 40:39.343
-So, what's your field exactly? Biology?
-Evolutionary biology.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.019
-Are we still evolving?
-Some of us.

40:42.815 --> 40:46.683
Look, Lieutenant, I'm really busy right now,
and I don't have time to be socializing,

40:46.778 --> 40:50.270
-so if you don't mind.
-I'm not here to ask you out, Dr. Green.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.480
I just thought
there might be something else

40:51.574 --> 40:54.486
you could tell me
about John Whitney's work.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.452
Well, I'll take you to Dr. Frock, our curator.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.155
He could probably explain John Whitney
better than I can.

41:03.044 --> 41:06.753
-It's Margo.
-Who have you brought me?

41:06.839 --> 41:08.454
A policeman. Lieutenant D'Agosta.

41:08.549 --> 41:13.669
Well, how goes the gradual extinction
of the human race, Lieutenant?

41:13.763 --> 41:16.550
I'm doing what I can to keep it orderly.

41:16.641 --> 41:20.304
You and the lieutenant are kindred spirits.
He's very superstitious.

41:20.395 --> 41:23.933
-I don't know about "very."
-Well, you must excuse Margo, Lieutenant.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.639
She believes that science
must destroy myth,

41:26.734 --> 41:31.444
and as a consequence, she has very little
patience with superstitious people like us.

41:31.531 --> 41:34.523
Margo, did I ever tell you
about my experiences

41:34.617 --> 41:36.699
with the Khoe tribe in Botswana land?

41:36.786 --> 41:39.573
-Yes, more than once.
-Haven't told him.

41:40.623 --> 41:45.492
The Khoe tribe, Lieutenant, believed
that headaches were caused by sorcery

41:46.379 --> 41:50.497
and the pin poke of the headache victim
would identify the sorcerer,

41:50.591 --> 41:52.422
and then go off and murder him.

41:52.510 --> 41:57.095
Of course, the kinfolk of the sorcerer
would feel they had to avenge his death,

41:57.181 --> 41:59.467
so they'd go and in turn
kill the headache victim.

41:59.559 --> 42:02.676
And I'm sure you can imagine
how it eventually all turned out.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.761
-What's that?
-Well, it's a medical miracle.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.393
Everybody stopped having headaches.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.850
Lieutenant, what would
a superstitious police officer

42:10.945 --> 42:13.186
possibly want with an old fossil like me?

42:13.281 --> 42:15.897
-He wants to know about John Whitney.
-You think there's some connection

42:15.992 --> 42:18.699
between the vandalism in John's office
and the murder?

42:18.786 --> 42:21.323
Maybe.
What's John Whitney doing in Brazil?

42:21.414 --> 42:24.872
Well, John's an anthropologist.
He's in Brazil studying ancient tribes,

42:24.959 --> 42:28.451
their rituals, their environmental
and social relations, their culture.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.286
When was the last time
you heard from him?

42:30.381 --> 42:32.542
I haven't had actual contact with him
for months,

42:32.633 --> 42:35.500
but just yesterday, we received
a wonderful artifact.

42:35.595 --> 42:38.007
Yeah. I took a look at it.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.008
That artifact's rather important
to me, Lieutenant,

42:40.099 --> 42:42.966
because it may help to illuminate
a scientific theory

42:43.061 --> 42:45.052
I've been expounding for some time.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.387
-The Callisto Effect.
-What's that?

42:47.482 --> 42:52.272
It's a commonly-held belief that life evolved
gradually by natural selection.

42:52.653 --> 42:56.396
Dr. Frock argues that sometimes
there are sudden evolutionary changes

42:56.491 --> 43:00.575
that create a grotesque
and short-lived aberrant species.

43:01.287 --> 43:05.621
Okay, so, John Whitney's down in Brazil
studying ancient tribal rituals.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.413
Could any of these rituals
have anything to do with, say,

43:09.504 --> 43:11.870
ripping out the human hypothalamus?

43:12.340 --> 43:15.377
-I beg your pardon?
-Human hypothalamus?

43:20.014 --> 43:21.094
Never mind.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.803
You smell that?

43:25.103 --> 43:28.516
It's that same stink
from where they found that guard.

43:29.065 --> 43:30.896
Better get some backup down here.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.933
2-4, 2-4, this is 2-6, you copy?

43:34.028 --> 43:35.939
Shit! We're under too much concrete.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.355
What the fuck was that?

43:40.201 --> 43:43.193
-Was that in front of us?
-It's hard to tell.

44:28.374 --> 44:32.333
The guy was a convicted rapist.
He's a suspect in a couple of murders,

44:32.420 --> 44:33.751
two terms of hard time,

44:33.838 --> 44:36.170
and he fits the description
given to us by the two boys.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.498
Those kids didn't see him
commit the murder.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.834
Lieutenant, come on.
This place, it could've been anything.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.839
He attacked McNally with a fucking ax.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.886
You know,
you wanna take somebody's head off,

44:44.974 --> 44:48.967
-an ax is a pretty good way to do it.
-I know. I know, I know, I know, I know.

44:49.061 --> 44:51.894
-So what's the matter?
-Something's not right.

44:52.273 --> 44:53.604
-What's not right?
-Something.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.056
Something what?

44:55.151 --> 44:57.016
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.443
Hey, here comes the rent-a-cop.

45:05.786 --> 45:08.778
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

45:10.583 --> 45:13.370
-Can I get a little help here?
-Congratulations, Lieutenant.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.998
-Looks like you've got your man.
-Maybe.

45:16.172 --> 45:17.912
-Maybe?
-Maybe.

45:18.132 --> 45:21.966
The man was covered in the dead guard's
blood. He was carrying his wallet.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.510
He tried to cut his head off with an ax.

45:24.597 --> 45:27.555
-What do you need? A videotape?
-That'd help.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.717
-This is nuts.
-Hey, something's wrong.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.722
We got a homeless ex-con
who gets his jollies

45:32.813 --> 45:34.724
from ripping out people's hypothalamuses?

45:34.815 --> 45:37.227
What's he doing?
Starting a hypothalamus collection?

45:37.318 --> 45:40.776
This guy gets on a boat sailing from Brazil,
he kills everyone onboard,

45:40.863 --> 45:42.569
then he catches a cab to the museum,

45:42.657 --> 45:44.443
where he hides in the closet
in the sub-basement.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.900
I don't know anything
about boats from Brazil,

45:47.995 --> 45:50.953
but it's obvious to me
that this man killed Frederick Ford.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.999
Two plus two, Lieutenant,
in my book, that's four.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.168
You have to let the gala go on tonight.

45:57.255 --> 46:00.042
I don't have to let anything go on tonight.

46:05.137 --> 46:06.172
Asshole.

46:06.806 --> 46:09.639
-Lieutenant.
-What's this?

46:09.767 --> 46:12.133
We found this under the guy's bed.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.099
Jaime Martinez.

46:16.274 --> 46:19.858
He was one of the victims
on the Santos Morales.

46:20.695 --> 46:23.152
-Shit.
-This has gotta be our guy.

46:23.322 --> 46:26.860
-Lieutenant, it's for you.
-Who is it?

46:33.833 --> 46:35.698
-Hello?
-This is Mayor Owen.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.700
What's your first name, Lieutenant?

46:38.045 --> 46:39.581
-Vincent.
-May I call you Vincent?.

46:39.672 --> 46:40.661
-Sure.
-Good.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.121
You can call me Your Honor.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.958
Tell you what, Vincent.
Looking forward to this gala tonight.

46:45.177 --> 46:48.635
My wife is, too. She bought a killer dress
that shows off her cleavage.

46:48.723 --> 46:51.055
Have you ever seen my wife's cleavage?.
It's in all the papers.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.598
I can't say that I have, Your Honor.

46:52.685 --> 46:55.518
Well, you're one of the few people
in the city of Chicago who hasn't.

46:56.063 --> 46:57.269
That cleavage helped get me elected.

46:58.149 --> 46:59.264
I'll bet you don't know what to say.

46:59.692 --> 47:00.727
No, sir, I don't.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.434
So the thing is, Vincent,
this gala tonight is very important.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.770
It's important to the museum,
it's important to my wife,

47:05.906 --> 47:11.026
it's important to the city, and it's real
important to Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.

47:11.412 --> 47:12.743
-You know who they are?.
-No.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.412
Well, they're good friends of mine,
real good friends.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.156
They're good friends of the city.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.620
Real good friends.

47:18.711 --> 47:21.373
I was so upset when I thought
they would be disappointed tonight

47:21.464 --> 47:24.206
until I heard the wonderful news
that you caught that murderer.

47:24.467 --> 47:28.710
T errible business. Anyway, I called
to congratulate you on a job well done.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.011
I'm so happy we'll be having
that gala tonight.

47:31.098 --> 47:33.180
I'm gonna call the chief and tell him
just how happy I am.

47:33.267 --> 47:34.256
Nice talking to you, Vincent.

47:42.234 --> 47:44.816
I'm going to clear the wings
of museum personnel

47:45.363 --> 47:48.230
and open only the central exhibition area.

47:48.949 --> 47:51.861
And I'm going to maintain
police presence throughout.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.117
How much police presence?

47:55.122 --> 47:58.285
As much as I goddamn deem necessary.

48:02.588 --> 48:03.919
-Tell Bert...
-What?

48:04.006 --> 48:06.543
I wanna make a final sweep
while the wings are still closed.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.090
Give me a team of dogs.

48:08.177 --> 48:11.886
But we already swept with dogs, Lieutenant,
right after we found the body.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.588
So get better dogs. I'll take them down
myself, and you're coming with me.

49:24.128 --> 49:27.871
Dermestes vulpinus.
That's the dermestid beetle.

49:29.091 --> 49:33.380
Match with 33% Hemidactylus turcicus.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.093
Hemidactylus turcicus?.
What the hell's that?

49:38.726 --> 49:40.136
Have you seen Greg?

49:40.227 --> 49:42.309
-He's down there.
-Thanks.

49:42.396 --> 49:46.389
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.
How wonderful you look this evening.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.270
I'm Greg Lee.

49:49.361 --> 49:53.650
I'm Greg Lee, Mr. Blaisedale.
How rich you look this evening.

49:54.408 --> 49:57.946
Good evening, Mr. Blaisedale.
I didn't know you have a daughter.

49:58.037 --> 50:00.619
Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt
your little meeting.

50:00.706 --> 50:03.197
-You not going to the party?
-I'm going.

50:03.292 --> 50:05.999
Don't get your greedy little hopes up.

50:06.086 --> 50:08.202
Can you identify these species?

50:08.297 --> 50:09.787
Now you want my help?

50:09.882 --> 50:12.419
Look, can you identify them or not?

50:15.054 --> 50:18.387
Hemidactylus turcicus.
That's a Turkish gecko.

50:18.474 --> 50:19.839
-Gecko?
-Yeah, a lizard.

50:19.934 --> 50:22.141
Yes, I know what a gecko is.

50:22.228 --> 50:25.015
But reptilian and beetle DNA
on the same strand?

50:25.105 --> 50:26.515
Well, maybe your source is contaminated.

50:26.607 --> 50:28.848
It's not contaminated.
I scraped the cells myself.

50:28.943 --> 50:30.274
Then it's your software.

50:30.361 --> 50:35.151
Of course, I'd be shocked to think
that it may not be 1 00% accurate.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.444
You can get back to the Blaisedales now.

51:01.642 --> 51:05.430
Well, it looks to me as if we're just about
as ready as we're going to be.

51:18.242 --> 51:20.449
You know,
they're closing down the wing soon.

51:20.536 --> 51:23.994
-I wouldn't want you to miss the party.
-I'll be there.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.893
We'll head down to the basement
to our storage level here

51:47.980 --> 51:49.516
and work our way east to west.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.223
-Make sense to you?
-Yeah, I think it'll work.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.149
You got something for the dogs?

51:58.949 --> 52:02.032
Pollux. Castor.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.034
Hello.

52:34.318 --> 52:35.683
Hello.

52:39.782 --> 52:43.741
-Margo, are you here?
-I'm at the electron microscope.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.159
Come on, girl. It's party time.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.035
Wait. You're not even dressed yet.

52:50.125 --> 52:51.581
I need you to take a look at this.

52:51.669 --> 52:54.661
I'm not gonna take a look at anything
until you get dressed.

52:54.755 --> 52:58.122
That parasite Greg Lee is gonna steal
your grant right out from under you

52:58.217 --> 53:01.459
-unless you get in there and start pitching.
-All right. All right.

53:01.804 --> 53:04.341
Try and guess what that is.

53:10.562 --> 53:13.224
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

53:13.315 --> 53:16.352
-It's a dermestid beetle.
-Dermestid? Are you sure?

53:16.443 --> 53:18.900
-Remember the leaves from Whitney's crate?
-Yeah.

53:18.987 --> 53:20.397
That beetle ate part of one.

53:20.489 --> 53:24.198
I ran some cells through the interpolator
searching for a match.

53:24.284 --> 53:26.445
It came back "dermestid beetle."

53:26.537 --> 53:31.622
But the analysis also revealed
a large percentage of reptilian DNA.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.875
Reptilian?
Well, there must be some mistake, Margo.

53:35.963 --> 53:39.080
-I ran it through three times.
-There must be something in the leaf.

53:39.174 --> 53:40.789
Take a look at that printout.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.716
Hormones. Lots of them.

53:43.804 --> 53:50.300
Gammaglobulin AXY,
left positive, reverse transcriptase.

53:51.395 --> 53:55.229
That's an enzyme almost always found
in association with viruses.

53:55.315 --> 53:57.852
This plant is heavily infected with a virus.

53:57.943 --> 54:00.059
So it's taken over some of the plant cells

54:00.154 --> 54:04.067
and inserted its own genetic material
into the plant's genes.

54:04.158 --> 54:07.446
But why would a virus
code for animal proteins?

54:23.343 --> 54:24.753
Mr. Mayor.

54:24.845 --> 54:26.631
Your Honor,
how do you feel about the exhibit?

54:26.722 --> 54:28.758
-Very, very proud.
-Are you superstitious?

54:28.849 --> 54:30.931
Only around election time.

54:31.518 --> 54:33.099
Let's go, Castor. Come on, Pollux.

54:33.187 --> 54:35.269
Come on, boy. Come on.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.763
-Anything?
-No, nothing yet.

54:37.858 --> 54:41.350
There's a lot of foreign smells down here,
which might knock off their olfactors.

54:41.445 --> 54:44.357
We'll have to take it slow.
Come on, boy. Attaboy!

55:16.396 --> 55:19.183
-You're looking very dapper tonight.
-You think so?

55:19.608 --> 55:21.974
'Cause I don't see too many other guys
wearing these ruffles.

55:22.069 --> 55:23.434
You look cool.

55:25.572 --> 55:28.314
Your Honor, so pleased to see you.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.818
So excited about being here.

55:29.910 --> 55:33.118
What you got? What you got? That's right.
Come on. What you got? What you got?

55:33.205 --> 55:35.070
What you got? What you got?

55:35.874 --> 55:38.456
We know these hormones
are responsible for growth,

55:38.544 --> 55:42.162
bone structure, exoskeletal physiology
and skin maintenance.

55:42.256 --> 55:45.168
A huge influx of these
could easily cause it to change.

55:45.259 --> 55:46.294
Of course it could.

55:46.385 --> 55:48.671
Do you think Whitney knew
about the properties of these leaves

55:48.762 --> 55:49.797
before he sent them?

55:49.888 --> 55:52.300
Maybe he wasn't just using them
as packing material.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.473
Maybe there was nothing missing
from the crate.

55:54.560 --> 55:58.519
Maybe the leaves were the shipment.
But why? I don't get it.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.178
Margo.

56:01.066 --> 56:03.682
The hormones listed
in this analysis of the leaf,

56:03.777 --> 56:06.769
they're all produced
by the human hypothalamus.

56:06.864 --> 56:09.401
Of course,
it's a much more concentrated form here,

56:09.491 --> 56:13.359
and one milligram of this material
is equal to more than 1 00 milligrams

56:13.453 --> 56:14.943
of the hormone produced
by the hypothalamus.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.949
Wait, wait. Remember when the Lieutenant

56:17.040 --> 56:18.951
said something
about the human hypothalamus?

56:19.042 --> 56:20.953
-Yeah.
-Do you think this is somehow connected

56:21.044 --> 56:22.659
to Fred Ford's murder?

56:23.797 --> 56:29.463
Well, if it is, whoever killed Fred Ford
really needs the hormones on that leaf.

56:29.553 --> 56:31.043
We better find Lieutenant D'Agosta.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.258
Where the hell is Margo?

56:40.856 --> 56:42.847
He's absolutely correct.

56:46.612 --> 56:49.900
-Harriet, George, I'm so pleased to see you.
-Hello.

56:49.990 --> 56:52.276
-This is wonderful. Wonderful.
-Thank you.

56:52.367 --> 56:54.528
Come with me.
I have someone I want to introduce you to.

56:54.620 --> 56:55.905
Thank you.

56:55.996 --> 56:59.454
Michael, Candice,
I want you to meet the Blaisedales.

56:59.541 --> 57:00.906
-Harriet and George.
-Hello.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.325
Come on. What've we got?

57:05.339 --> 57:06.419
Detective!

57:13.055 --> 57:16.297
-Run. Find, find!
-I've got you.

57:24.107 --> 57:29.022
Johnson, Parkinson here. It's time
to shut down the outer cells. Do you read?

57:29.446 --> 57:32.188
Right, sir. Still checking the lab area.

57:32.491 --> 57:34.732
Lab area?
Everyone was supposed to be out by 6:. 00.

57:34.826 --> 57:37.533
I just came from the lab, Mr. Parkinson.
I was the last one out.

57:37.621 --> 57:40.328
You sure? It could be a long night
for anyone locked in down there.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.155
It's completely deserted.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.750
It's clear. Shut it down.

57:48.131 --> 57:49.667
Shutting down.

58:02.729 --> 58:03.809
Done.

58:06.566 --> 58:10.775
If he's not upstairs, one of the other officers
will probably know how to find him.

58:10.862 --> 58:13.729
-It's locked.
-Well, it seems that that imbecile Parkinson

58:13.824 --> 58:17.157
made good on his promise.
He sealed off the entire wing.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.780
-Come on, Professor.
-Where?

58:18.870 --> 58:20.861
Down the fire stairs
and across the sub-basement.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.072
-Down the stairs?
-I hope your brakes work.

58:27.129 --> 58:29.996
-Champagne. How lovely.
-Yes.

58:30.090 --> 58:32.923
-Thank you very much, Mister...
-Lee. Greg Lee.

58:33.635 --> 58:37.344
And may I say how enchanting you look
this evening, Mrs. Blaisedale.

58:37.889 --> 58:41.052
-We've gone off the map, Evans.
-This is the old coal tunnel.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.508
-Lieutenant.
-Yeah?

58:42.602 --> 58:45.514
-The scent seems to be getting stronger.
-What the hell is this?

58:45.605 --> 58:48.472
Electric trams hauled coal right into
the basement from the old barges.

58:48.567 --> 58:51.183
-That's how Chicago stayed warm.
-How far does it go?

58:51.278 --> 58:52.688
This one goes all the way to Lake Michigan.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.316
At least that's what they say.
No one really comes down here.

58:55.407 --> 58:56.772
Let me ask you something.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.074
Could somebody get off a ship
docked at the lake

58:59.161 --> 59:00.571
and go through these tunnels

59:00.662 --> 59:03.074
all the way to the museum
without being seen?

59:03.165 --> 59:05.372
-Sure.
-Hey, we're moving now, guys.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.574
Let's go.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.512
-What in God's name is that smell?
-I don't like this.

59:24.603 --> 59:25.683
Okay, we can do this.

59:25.771 --> 59:27.727
Bradley and I go together.
Evans, you're behind me.

59:27.814 --> 59:31.477
Hollingsworth, stay here. If I call you,
get that cannon up there. Let's go.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.318
Come on, Castor.

59:43.747 --> 59:46.284
There's something moving
right in front of us!

59:46.374 --> 59:49.662
Castor, Pollux, heel! Heel!

59:54.341 --> 59:56.457
Hollingsworth! Hollingsworth!

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.178
Hey, you okay?

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.851
Castor? Pollux?

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.150
Holy shit!

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.612
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the hell did this?

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.037
Castor?

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:32.125
-Oh, dear God! Pollux!
-Hey, Bradley, no!

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.873
-Pollux!
-Bradley!

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.833
Pollux!

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.334
Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth!

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.835
Take Evans and get your ass upstairs.

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:41.134
Find Cuthbert, Parkinson,
whoever the hell's in charge,

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.963
and clear out the museum. Go! Now!

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:46.382
Bradley!

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.385
Bradley!

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.224
Bradley!

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.984
-Are you lost, Margo?
-Of course I'm lost.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.409
Just checking.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:14.663
Pollux!

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:17.291
Pollux!

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.296
Pollux!

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.000
Pollux!

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.210
Pollux!

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.512
Come on, boy. Come on. Let's go.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.478
Come on. What's the matter with you?

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:09.382
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
and thank you very much for being here.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:14.178
I'd like to introduce to you
one of this museum's best friends

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.638
and staunchest supporters,

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.271
the mayor of our city,
the Honorable Robert Owen.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:25.147
Thank you, Dr. Cuthbert.
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:30.699
I am so excited and honored to be here
at this wonderful museum this evening.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.363
As we march forward

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.909
with fragile footsteps into the sunset
of the last few years...

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.164
-Is he speaking English?
-I don't know.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.672
Bradley! Bradley!

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:53.409
Here, boy. You scared me. You scared me.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.928
-This coffee's terrible.
-It's bitter. Very bitter.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:26.018
-What do you think, darling?
-The telling moment.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.192
Not for me. Not today.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:34.568
...the beginning of superstition, really...

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:38.029
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.
-...in Egypt very early about 50,000 B.C.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:43.460
But here's the pièce de résistance.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:50.301
This is a very rare sacrificial palette
from Mesoamerica.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.887
-The priests would sacrifice their victims...
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.807
-... by cutting out the beating heart.
-Excuse me.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:01.728
-That's pleasant. Then what?
-Well, then they would eat it.

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:06.017
You know, I think I could use
one of these things down at City Hall.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:07.647
Shall we?

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.818
Primordial forest. There's Pan.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:26.332
And here we are in Brazil.
We're with the spirits of the Amazon now.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:31.087
And here is the great devil god,

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:35.967
the Kothoga,
sitting on the skulls of his dead victims.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.047
-Look out.
-Out of the way.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.009
Look at this.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.608
You know, I wonder what...

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:53.230
What the... What in the hell...

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:55.907
Come on. Come on.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:57.575
-Dr. Cuthbert.
-Wait.

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:58.819
-Oh, God.
-Mr. Mayor!

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.949
Excuse me!
May I ask what you think you're doing?

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.999
My name's Hollingsworth,
Chicago homicide.

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.078
We have to get everybody out of here now.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.543
We got a very dangerous situation,
Your Honor.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:28.477
What the hell...

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:32.898
Come on. Let's go!

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:37.782
Holy shit, look at this.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.905
We got a robbery alert
in the new exhibition space.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.913
-What the hell is going on?
-I have no idea, but I'll find out.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.540
-Keep moving.
-Come on, let's go.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.749
Five, six, seven.
The whole board's going down.

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:01.840
Code 27.
It says we're having an earthquake!

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:07.724
This is Chicago.
We don't have earthquakes in Chicago.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.065
Johnson, Wootton,
we've got problems up here!

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.273
The computer's forcing down
the last cell doors.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:22.652
Jesus! This diorama wall,
can't we override manually?

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:24.032
Not in code status, I can't.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.738
We're gonna have to reset
the whole system.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:27.949
That's impossible.
Somebody's fucking with us.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:49.228
Shit. We're shut down.
Everything is shut down.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.990
Wootton, Johnson, what the hell's going on
up there? The fire doors are down.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.497
-Shit!
-Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.872
Where the hell are you?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.375
Phones are out.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.587
And all the power's out
all over the museum.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:44.676
Well, what about the emergency generator?

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:49.303
It's only for the lab area to keep their
computer systems and refrigerators going.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.886
It's over in the east wing.
It's about a mile from here.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.848
What about the backup batteries
for the security system?

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.525
Maybe we can reboot,
then get it back online.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:02.278
It's over in the power room somewheres.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.279
I'll go.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:09.361
Excuse me, sir. May I ask you
a few questions? Can I ask you a few...

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:12.447
Don't lock the door.
I hate when you do that.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.313
What the hell did that?

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:49.484
Control, this is Parkinson.
What the hell is going on down there?

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.195
Would you answer me, for Christ's sakes?

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.781
Someone fucking trashed
the backup system.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.333
Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.
Where the hell are you?.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.036
Hey, asshole.
Aren't you gonna answer the man?

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.339
I can't reach the damn control room.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:14.221
All right. McNally, help me get a count.
Let's figure a way out of here.

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:18.021
We can't lift the fire door
until we get the computer restarted.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.811
The fire stairs only lead to the basement.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.358
Then maybe that's what we'll do.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:25.607
Heel. Heel. What is it?

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.273
What is it?

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:29.733
This is absurd.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.285
Every police officer in the city of Chicago
is gonna be on the other side of that door

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:36.705
in five minutes trying to figure out a way
to get through. We wait here.

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:17.864
You ready?

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.501
I don't think you understand
how this works.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.958
You're a junior detective.
You don't order the Mayor to do anything.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:31.840
All I know is I've been ordered to get
everybody out of this building.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:35.219
Now someone or something is in here.
You saw what it can do.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:39.310
-Sorry, but I'm not budging.
-Is anybody there?.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:43.101
-Wootton?
-No, D'Agosta. Put the Mayor on.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.775
Put him on!

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.149
It's for you, Your Honor.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.200
-Put this over your head.
-This is Mayor Owen.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.027
Mayor Owen, this is Lieutenant D'Agosta.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.829
-Lieutenant D'Augusta.
-D'Agosta, sir.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:02.496
Vincent. Badge number 1 41 73.
We spoke once before.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:05.374
-Do you remember?.
-I want you to consider very carefully...

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:08.046
With all due respect, sir,
you can fire me on Monday.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:11.046
But right now, I want you
to shut your fucking mouth and listen.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.423
I'm putting
Sergeant Hollingsworth in charge,

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:16.472
and you're going to do exactly
what he tells you to do.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.140
-Or what, Lieutenant?
-Or none of you

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.139
are gonna live to see election day.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:21.886
Hollingsworth.

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:25.064
-Hollingsworth, are you there?.
-Excuse me, Your Honor.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.475
-I'm here, Lieutenant.
-Take the fire stairs back down

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.812
to the sub-basement
and head west into the service area.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:34.065
Go through the passageway
for the old coal line.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.283
You'll come up across the street
from the museum.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:40.033
Now you go slow. You go quiet.
You stick together.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.989
-You understand?
-I got it.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.415
I'm not walking through some
filthy crawl space...

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:47.995
Shut up, T om!

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.341
-Let's go.
-Let's move.

01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:59.223
Excuse me, but I don't care
what the Lieutenant,

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:02.264
whatever the hell his name is, says.
I'm staying!

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.846
I'm afraid my wife and I
will be staying, as well.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.148
Mr. Blaisedale, we must stay together.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:10.226
But she won't physically be able to go
downstairs or through tunnels.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.652
It's best if we stay behind.

01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:14.151
-One of us can carry her.
-It's out of the question.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.697
We'll be fine here.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.403
Okay, officer, I'll stay behind
and protect Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:20.828
Give me a break!

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.164
We're not going. What are you gonna do?

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.286
-Shoot us?
-All right. All right.

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:28.373
One of you stay here with them.
Now who's it gonna be?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.749
-I'll stay.
-I'll stay.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.373
McNally, you're staying.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:36.878
-Hey, you got plenty of ammo?
-I'm loaded.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:40.469
Okay, let's move.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:43.259
Dr. Cuthbert. Dr. Cuthbert.

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:45.473
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you should do this.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.226
Bullshit, Tom. You're fired.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.068
I'll lead with the shotgun.
Bailey, you stay at the back.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:59.154
The rest are single file.
Now, it's gonna be dark.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:02.783
We go slow, we go quiet
and we stick together.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.160
-Inside.
-Thank you.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.662
-I got you.
-You all right?

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:10.415
-Come on.
-All right, stay close and watch your step.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.046
Let's keep it going. Keep it going.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:18.298
Can I get you a drink?

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:27.928
What is it, boy?

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:32.016
Let's go.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.033
Oh, God, Lieutenant D'Agosta!
We've been trying to find you!

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.958
You gotta get out of here.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.621
Oh, my God! No!

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.642
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:31.409
Somebody want to tell me
what in God's name that was?

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.415
I think it's the Kothoga.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:35.378
John Whitney must have found it
somewhere, somehow

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.081
and sent it back to the museum.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.758
But, for God's sake,
why wouldn't he give us warning?

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.302
How big were those crates
that John Whitney sent back?

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:43.469
Not very big.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.798
How the hell does something like that
fit inside one of them?

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:50.478
In those crates that Whitney sent back,
the artifact was packed in a leaf specimen

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:54.853
that carried a parasitic fungus.
The fungus was loaded with hormones,

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:59.395
animal hormones that are produced
in the thalamoid region of the human brain.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.903
-You mean the hypothalamus.
-I know this is crazy,

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:06.365
but maybe this animal started out
as something else,

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:10.077
a chameleon, a lizard, maybe even a dog.

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:14.377
It ate those leaves, and it changed
into whatever it is now.

01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:18.380
Into what we just saw.

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:24.386
You're not crazy, Margo.
Don't you see, girl?

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:28.891
It's the Callisto Effect. It's really true.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:31.560
The Kothoga myth was based on fact.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.934
People of the Zenzera tribe,
when they were threatened by an enemy,

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:38.233
they must have fed some of those
hormonal leaves to some animal,

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.484
and it caused a riot in its DNA,
and it was transformed into

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:46.318
some horrific beast, but the beast
needed those hormones to stay alive.

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:49.279
So when it was big enough
and deadly enough, they stopped feeding it.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:52.285
So it would have to find some other way
to get the hormone.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:56.335
Their enemies. Yes, and when the enemies
were dead, it had no more hormones,

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:59.334
it would eventually die and the Zenzera
would come out from hiding.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:03.509
Well, we don't have time to wait
for eventually. So, here's my question.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:07.088
-How the fuck do we kill that thing?
-I have to figure out what this is first.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:08.468
We need to get back to my lab.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.515
I'll never make it up those stairs.
You leave me here.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.139
-I'll carry you.
-Don't be ridiculous.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.936
You have more important things to do.
I'm staying here.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:45.883
Right here!

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:54.135
All right, it's Martin.
I'm here on the ground.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.849
Let's clear this area. Clear the steps.

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:19.752
First, I liquefy and purify my sample.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:23.376
Then, this machine will amplify
the DNA strand,

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:28.461
and, finally, scan the created gel image.

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:32.264
Then it's matched against a huge database
we've compiled over the last three years.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.682
Very impressive.

01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:37.845
-How long is this gonna take?
-A little while.

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:39.930
-That's terrific.
-What have you got there?

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.515
Good luck bullet.

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:46.020
-Superstitious. I remember now.
-Yeah.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:49.941
-So, does your bullet have a story?
-I was on the beat my rookie year,

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.617
and I saw this guy
who'd locked his keys in his car

01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:53.820
with his motor running.

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:56.781
He's got a clothes hanger
and he's trying to get the lock off.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.115
So I go over, try to help him out,

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.451
and what I didn't know was
that he'd just robbed

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:04.585
a liquor store a block away.
So, he's concentrating so hard, you know.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:08.088
He doesn't see me
till I'm right up on top of him.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.594
I surprise him. He turns and...

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:14.389
Point blank range.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:17.718
It doesn't pop, though.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:21.389
Doesn't go off. This bullet.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:29.571
So, what did you do?

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.358
I took the gun away from him
and beat the shit out of him.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:36.571
Anyway, the forensics told me later
that the bullet's perfect.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.323
It should have fired. I should be dead.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:44.291
-So, in other words, a miracle of physics.
-Maybe just plain old-fashioned good luck.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.760
This is Martin.
Has anybody seen the Mayor?

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.213
Give me a location on the Mayor.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:02.221
What people don't realize is that

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:05.023
molecular biology is
the science of the future.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:07.021
You know what I mean?
If people were just given...

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:10.604
I'm not taking the fall for this fiasco,
I can tell you that.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:15.359
Come Monday morning,
everything will get straightened out.

01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:19.663
And whatever prankster
created this miasma, I swear to God,

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.657
when I get my hands on him...

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.176
God!

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:06.971
There's no exact match here.
Surprise, surprise.

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:09.723
4%. 2%... Hey, wait a minute.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.150
Hemidactylus turcicus 45%?

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:15.024
-It's a gecko, same as the beetle.
-What are you talking about?

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.822
Well, whatever this thing was,
it ate those leaves

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.902
and is rapidly evolving
into something reptilian.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.033
-You mean it's still changing.
-It's quite possible.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:22.690
Help! Pull me up! Pull me up!

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.866
-We got you!
-We got you!

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:29.112
Pull me up, man! Pull me up!

01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:34.243
Help me! Help!

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:40.545
-Help me!
-Hold on! Hold on!

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.627
Please! God!

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:48.344
Help me! Help! Help me!

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:40.767
-It can't be.
-What? What is it?

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.274
33% homo sapien.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:47.241
-Are you telling me that thing's part human?
-No, I'm saying more than that.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:50.160
According to this data,
that thing started out as a human.

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.454
I'm gonna keep scanning.
There must be some error.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:53.621
Lieutenant.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.958
Hollingsworth. Where are you?

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.331
I'm just about to take them
into the coal tunnels.

01:26:59.423 --> 01:27:01.379
Shit. I think that thing
is following us, Lieutenant.

01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:02.876
I think it knows where we are.

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:07.462
Okay, now, listen. Those tunnels lead right
across the street. Just keep going.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:09.212
Get those people out.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:11.969
We're gonna follow you
and decoy the fucker away.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:14.718
Hollingsworth.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:19.185
I'll see you out on the street.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.654
Where are those leaves with the hormones
that thing likes to eat?

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:32.077
Okay, we know this thing is part reptilian,
probably ectothermic,

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:34.621
so it can't handle extremes of hot and cold.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.075
Maybe if we can change its temperature
by 30 to 40 degrees...

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:42.254
-What do you mean "maybe"?
-We can freeze the son of a bitch.

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.955
-Come on.
-Here.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:28:00.977
-Dr. Frock?
-Let me go first.

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:12.659
-Don't look.
-No, no, no!

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:24.504
I'm really sorry.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:37.263
-Let's go.
-Hey.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.797
Get me more guns, God damn it!

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:15.009
Hollingsworth, you read me?.

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:17.264
Hollingsworth, you read me?.

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:21.645
Yeah, Lieutenant, I'm here. Scared shitless.

01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:25.060
-But I'm here.
-Just keep moving. We're on our way.

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:27.935
You hear me?.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:31.104
-You read me?
-Yeah. I got it.

01:29:31.449 --> 01:29:32.734
I hope you know what we're doing.

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:34.908
-What was that?
-Just keep moving.

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:36.993
Just keep moving.

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:14.906
Hang on. Hang on.

01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:19.319
Okay. Let's go.

01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:27.202
-Bailey!
-Yeah?

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:29.663
It's not getting any deeper,
so keep them moving.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.794
-All right.
-And watch your back.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:36.840
Okay.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:52.477
-Bailey.
-Yeah?

01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:54.066
You hear something?

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:01.949
No.

01:31:05.043 --> 01:31:06.249
Bailey!

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.995
Bailey!

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:13.290
Bailey!

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:18.886
Move out of the way.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.220
Move!

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:24.225
Stay back!

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:27.478
Move!

01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:30.272
-Bailey!
-What do you see?

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.321
I can't run.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:03.382
This way, everybody. Go.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:30.617
Listen up.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.208
Now, whatever that was,
something made it go the other way.

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:37.587
So stay close to me
and I will get you out of here.

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:42.011
Give me the leaves.

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:45.427
I'm gonna take them and tie them
on that grate over there.

01:32:45.518 --> 01:32:47.634
I think the draft will blow the smell
down the tunnels.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.303
Come on.

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:32.617
Go! Hurry!

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.165
Hey, I found it.

01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:43.504
-Good. Go! Go!
-Oh, thank God, we're out!

01:34:43.761 --> 01:34:45.297
We're out, thank God.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.968
-All right. All right. Everybody.
-Hurry.

01:34:50.059 --> 01:34:52.721
-Let's go. All right.
-Come on, don't panic.

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:25.546
I'll need some help for Dr. Cuthbert.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.681
Give me that.
Get inside the lab and lock the door.

01:35:39.776 --> 01:35:41.732
-What about you?
-Just get inside. I'll hold it off.

01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:43.855
-Hold it off? You've seen that thing.
-Yeah, I've seen it.

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:46.233
Look, I know if we keep going,
we can find a way out.

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:48.155
I don't want a way out. We've gotta stop it.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:49.699
I'll stay with you.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:51.401
-Get inside.
-This is crazy.

01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:53.157
-Get inside! Now!
-This is...

01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:03.834
-This is stupid! Don't do this!
-Lock the goddamn door!

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:07.592
This is so stupid!

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.866
John Whitney? Oh, my God!

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.325
Lieutenant!

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:49.751
Dr. Green! Dr. Green! Open the door!

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:21.373
Open the goddamn door!

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:29.585
Come on. Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:35.215
Come on.

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:39.546
Oh, God! Just keep coming.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.715
Oh, God!

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.467
Just keep coming.

01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:46.386
Attaboy.

01:39:58.159 --> 01:39:59.274
Oh, God!

01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:09.458
Look, I...

01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:12.078
I know who you are.

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:35.105
Oh, God!

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:07.576
You go to hell!

01:42:42.073 --> 01:42:44.029
Captain, we finally got through that door.

01:42:44.116 --> 01:42:46.232
We found two more bodies
inside the main room.

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:47.692
-Not the Mayor.
-I can't tell, sir.

01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:49.618
-They're pretty badly messed up.
-How about the others?

01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:51.912
Well, we got the power up,
trying to get into the other levels,

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:54.741
-but it's a big place.
-When I get my hands on that D'Agosta,

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:57.167
-he'll be back in a fucking squad car.
-Captain.

01:42:58.297 --> 01:43:00.458
-Are you in charge here?
-Mr. Mayor.

01:43:00.758 --> 01:43:02.089
How'd you get out?

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:03.837
It's a long story, Captain.

01:43:03.928 --> 01:43:05.668
Look, these people are cold and tired.

01:43:05.763 --> 01:43:07.924
I'd like to get them under a roof
as soon as possible.

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.301
-Yes, sir.
-And leave De Augusta alone.

01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:12.717
Or else you might be back in that squad car.

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:22.059
Lieutenant!

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:26.356
-Jesus! You all right? You okay?
-I'm okay. Get me up.

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:29.282
-Get me up.
-All right.

01:43:34.125 --> 01:43:36.081
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Go, go, go!

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:37.408
Get in there.

01:43:40.423 --> 01:43:41.959
-Have you seen Dr. Green?
-No.

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.040
-Did you get those people out?
-Most of them.

01:43:44.135 --> 01:43:45.796
-Hey, Lieutenant, over here.
-You did well.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:48.127
-There's somebody inside.
-Open it up.

01:43:48.389 --> 01:43:49.424
Open it up.

01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:14.153
That's all we got here.

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:25.331
Keep it.

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:28.668
Let's go.
