00:14.800 --> 00:16.840
Ah, trees, trees...

00:17.000 --> 00:19.920
..and more trees.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.720
What a wonderfully green universe
we live in, eh?

00:23.880 --> 00:25.320
Where's that village?

00:25.480 --> 00:28.360
The UAV found it eleven clicks
southwest of here.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.080
Eleven? Oy...

00:36.000 --> 00:38.240
Here.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.160
- This path is well travelled.
- The Stargate is still in use by someone.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.280
Or... something.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.160
(Carter) The UAV photos were right.
There it is.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.520
- Looks like a church.
- And that would mean what?

01:09.680 --> 01:13.560
That it is most likely
Christians reside here, O'Neill.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.120
Thank you, Teal'c.

01:15.280 --> 01:19.160
This is the first sign of Christianity
we've ever encountered, sir.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.880
They must have been taken
from medieval Europe...

01:22.000 --> 01:25.360
- ..through the Antarctic gate.
- By which Goa'uld?

01:25.520 --> 01:27.800
That's a good question.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.560
Most Goa'uld that enslaved humans took
on the roles of those cultures' deities.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.680
- Ra, Apophis, Hathor...
- (O'Neill) Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.960
If they were Christians when they left
Earth, it suggests this Goa'uld is playing...

01:43.120 --> 01:45.720
God? As in God God?

01:45.880 --> 01:48.640
It's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

01:48.800 --> 01:51.600
I know of no Goa'uld capable
of showing the benevolence...

01:51.760 --> 01:55.360
- ..that I've read of in your Bible.
- You read the Bible, Teal'c?

01:55.520 --> 01:58.000
It is a significant part
of your Western culture.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.360
- Have you not read the Bible, O'Neill?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah... Not all of it.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.840
Actually, I'm listening to it on tape.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.000
Don't tell me how it ends(!)

02:33.480 --> 02:35.400
(man) That's it, son.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.440
Go inside!

02:42.720 --> 02:45.440
Quickly! Move!

02:52.600 --> 02:53.800
Hello?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.640
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're peaceful travellers.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.600
They're not buying it, Danny.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.000
Is this English?

03:16.360 --> 03:18.720
Middle English. Pre-Chaucer.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.640
"Myn Jesus, by the sorrows thou suffered
in thy passion in ye garden..."

03:24.800 --> 03:27.800
"In thy crucifixion and death,
show mercy to those who are...

03:27.960 --> 03:29.880
..about to be delivered unto the devil."

03:30.040 --> 03:33.840
It's a derivative of the Catholic prayer
for suffering souls.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.560
It's all right. It's all right.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.680
We'll get you out of this in a minute.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.120
Spare her! Please!

05:09.840 --> 05:14.320
Oh... We're not gonna... hurt her.
Or you. We're... friends.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.160
I'm... I'm Daniel.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.120
I am Simon. You have come through
the Circle of Darkness?

05:26.280 --> 05:28.240
The Stargate. Yes.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.320
Then you must be of his brethren.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.040
I beg of you, Mary is so young.
She did nothing to warrant sacrifice.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.400
(O'Neill) Whoa!

05:36.760 --> 05:39.040
What sacrifice?

05:39.200 --> 05:43.040
If you leave her body, the village canon
may choose another possessed soul.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.320
You think we're demons.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.840
He... thinks we're demons.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.080
Uh-huh?

05:50.240 --> 05:53.360
Well, we're not demons.
We're human, like you.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.560
From Earth, like you.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.760
Do other demons
come through the circle?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.880
You know he does.

06:01.040 --> 06:06.000
No, we don't know anything about him,
but we'd like to. What does he look like?

06:06.640 --> 06:10.400
Mostly he comes in his true form.
But demons can take many shapes!

06:15.080 --> 06:17.400
Major Carter, shield her eyes.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.720
Into the house. Quickly!

06:29.880 --> 06:31.960
- Leave her body! Please!
- Come on, get up.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.840
- Take me in her place!
- Stop that, will you? Come on.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.960
Up, up. Let's go, come on. Listen to me.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.000
We're not demons.
And Mary is not possessed.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.600
From the looks of it, she's a little sick.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.480
If you let us, we might be able to help her.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.120
Chickenpox. Trust me.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.880
- Her fever's pretty high.
- It'll break.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.160
Those spots'll get itchy,
but that's about as bad as it'll get.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.440
- You'll be fine in a couple of days.
- That will not be soon enough.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.760
The time of sacrifice is at hand.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.760
The elders have to perform the
trepanning ritual tonight to cleanse her.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.360
- Oh, jeez!
- What?

07:29.520 --> 07:33.560
It was a... procedure often done
in the Middle Ages. They...

07:34.640 --> 07:36.680
They'd drill a hole in the person's head.

07:36.840 --> 07:41.840
The evil spirits are released, thus saving
the person from eternal damnation.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.120
Thus... saving the person?

07:45.960 --> 07:48.800
They didn't call them the Dark Ages
because it was dark.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.600
(horn blows)

07:52.840 --> 07:56.040
My Jesus, by the sorrows you suffered
in your agony...

07:56.200 --> 07:58.240
(man) The demon comes!

07:58.400 --> 08:00.480
The demon comes!

08:00.640 --> 08:02.960
(growling)

08:05.480 --> 08:07.800
The demon comes?!

08:12.400 --> 08:14.320
(growling)

08:20.080 --> 08:21.640
Damn!

08:21.800 --> 08:24.200
- Unas?
- You are correct, O'Neill.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.280
The first host of the Goa'uld.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.600
No, no, no, no, no...
We killed him. He's dead.

08:35.039 --> 08:38.280
- We only killed one Unas.
- I thought there only was one!

08:38.440 --> 08:42.200
- Unas - uno, one?
- They are in fact a species.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.520
(distorted)
The time of sacrifice is at hand.

08:49.600 --> 08:56.200
My lord Satan calls for five
wretched souls to be claimed as his.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.160
- Satan?
- Sokar.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.240
Gathering host bodies.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.080
At sunrise shall I return to claim the five.

09:07.640 --> 09:13.920
If you have not chosen, I shall take
whom I please in far greater numbers.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.960
I think we were wrong about this Goa'uld.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.920
He isn't playing God.
He's playing the devil.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.000
- The time is at hand.
- No! No! No!

09:40.920 --> 09:42.200
Simon...

09:42.360 --> 09:44.800
The canon will return
from his hermitage soon.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.720
The creature that just sauntered
through your village is called an Unas.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.240
The time of sacrifice
has been declared. I fear...

09:51.400 --> 09:53.680
Simon! Listen to me!

09:57.360 --> 10:00.000
Look, we've run into
this kind of thing before.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.760
Now, it's not a demon. It...

10:02.920 --> 10:06.520
It's demonesque, I'll grant you.
But it's just a big, ugly creature.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.680
Its Goa'uld gives it strength, intelligence,
and the ability to regenerate.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.440
Yes.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.040
It's a very smart, resilient creature.

10:15.200 --> 10:20.080
In the service of Sokar who, for all intents
and purposes, is Satan to these people.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.800
- But it's not a demon.
- No. It's not a demon.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.080
My friends speak the truth, Simon.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.080
This demon is nothing more than
a parasite that inhabits another creature.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.360
Your fear is its greatest power over you.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.200
- You do not fear it?
- We do not.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.760
You say you have
killed an Unas once before?

10:58.280 --> 11:01.840
- Indeed.
- Then perhaps God has sent you.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.000
Perhaps you are the answer
to our prayers.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.800
All my life, I have asked God
to deliver us from this evil.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.360
So what did the lizard say?
That he'd be back at sunrise?

11:14.520 --> 11:17.600
- Are you contemplating attack, O'Neill?
- Sure. Why not?

11:18.080 --> 11:20.000
An Unas is difficult to destroy.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.560
A couple of shots with the staff,
we own him.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.480
We hope. It took Thor's hammer
to kill the last one.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.320
All right, lots of shots with the staff!

11:28.480 --> 11:30.920
Daniel, how long have they lived like this?

11:31.080 --> 11:34.120
- Well, I can't be sure without...
- A thousand years?

11:34.280 --> 11:36.400
- At least.
- That's long enough.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.440
These people are being terrorised.
We can stop it.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.360
Sokar will seek revenge.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.920
So we'll have 'em bury the gate
after we've gone!

11:44.080 --> 11:46.480
- They could come in ships.
- Ships?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.760
I can't be sure,
but this planet is years away...

11:49.920 --> 11:52.800
..from any known Goa'uld home world -
even with fast ships.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.160
Simon?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.520
Do you want us to do this?

11:57.680 --> 12:00.280
- Are we not in God's hands?
- (bell tolls)

12:00.800 --> 12:03.200
The canon has returned.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.440
The canon will choose
those for sacrifice tonight.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.760
- Why does he get to choose?
- He is our spiritual leader.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.680
It falls to him to determine those whose
souls are already possessed with evil.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.160
You have come down the path?
Through the Circle of Darkness?

12:54.960 --> 12:58.240
Something like that.
My name's Jack O'Neill.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.840
And you gave them entrance
to your home?!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.280
Yes. But I do not believe
they mean us harm.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.840
The tricks of Satan and his minions
are many.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.280
And only those weak of faith
are fooled by such deception.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.120
By granting them entrance, you have
spilled the blood of your people!

13:13.280 --> 13:16.200
We come as friends, sir.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.440
This one bears the mark of the devil!

13:37.400 --> 13:41.200
If you are human, as you say,
then your souls are damned!

13:41.360 --> 13:43.400
All right! That's enough.

13:44.920 --> 13:49.000
He is not a demon. He is a Jaffa.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.200
Satan is not involved here.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.040
That creature that strolled through here
a little while ago, it's called an Unas.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.240
And we have the power to stop it.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.000
That means no more sacrifices.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.600
All you have to do is give us
the chance to help. What do you say?

14:10.680 --> 14:16.120
If they came through the Circle of
Darkness, then their souls are unclean!

14:16.280 --> 14:19.080
It appears they do not desire
our assistance, O'Neill.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.720
Yeah, fine. Whatever. Have a nice day.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.480
You... shall be struck down!

14:27.760 --> 14:29.640
No... No, Canon...

14:29.800 --> 14:32.200
(rumbling)

15:07.400 --> 15:10.320
Sir, I've been disarmed.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.080
Yeah, I picked up on that, too.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.080
Teal'c's gone.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.000
Did we just get struck
by a big bolt of lightning?

15:19.160 --> 15:23.280
That's what it looked like.
Felt more like a zat blast to me.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.960
He... touched his ring
just before the lightning started.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.800
Carter, if I ever get the urge to...
help anybody again,...

15:33.880 --> 15:37.480
- ..feel free to give me a swift kick.
- (footsteps)

15:46.240 --> 15:50.880
I do not believe you are demons. I said so
to the canon, but he refuses to hear me.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.960
Where's our friend?

15:53.120 --> 15:56.280
It has been decided
he must endure the tests.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.800
- What tests?
- (woman) He's evil! Devil! Kill him!

15:59.960 --> 16:02.720
- Satan!
- (man) Burn him!

16:10.480 --> 16:12.400
He's evil!

16:20.440 --> 16:23.000
(woman) He's evil!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.240
What have you to say for yourself?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.640
That I do not serve
those who you would call demon.

16:42.840 --> 16:46.280
There are, living among us, demons...

16:46.440 --> 16:48.040
Teal'c.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.040
Say nothing more or they will kill him.

16:51.200 --> 16:56.920
For this reason,
we are commanded by God...

16:57.080 --> 17:00.760
..to seek out those spirits...
and punish them!

17:05.119 --> 17:07.680
- Mark of the devil.
- What?

17:08.200 --> 17:11.480
In the Middle Ages, one proof of
witchcraft was a mark on the body,...

17:11.640 --> 17:15.240
..supposedly made by the devil himself,
that was insensitive to pain.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.760
The first proof is given!

17:54.600 --> 17:57.280
- Daniel?
- It's not good.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.000
"And they went up...
on the breadth of the earth...

18:28.920 --> 18:32.320
..and fire came down from God...

18:32.480 --> 18:35.240
..out of heaven, and devoured them."

18:35.400 --> 18:37.720
- The water test.
- What?

18:37.880 --> 18:42.680
They weight a person and throw him
in the water. If he sinks, he's innocent.

18:42.840 --> 18:47.680
If he floats, he's guilty of witchcraft
and burned at the stake. It's catch-22.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.080
"..for ever and ever!"

18:56.160 --> 18:58.600
Archangel... Saint Michael,...

18:59.200 --> 19:01.440
..defend us in battle.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.520
Thrust into hell... Satan...

19:05.320 --> 19:10.360
..and all the evil spirits
who prowl upon the Earth!

19:15.040 --> 19:16.960
Amen.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.680
- We'll go back where we came from!
- He's innocent!

19:22.840 --> 19:24.960
You sons of bitches!

19:25.360 --> 19:26.760
Argh!

19:57.960 --> 20:01.040
God's will has been done.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.600
Your friend's soul is clean. If you wish,
he'll be given a Christian burial.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.760
- What?
- You're free to go.

20:50.920 --> 20:55.360
I insist that you remain in chains until
you return to the Circle of Darkness,...

20:55.520 --> 20:58.240
..to whatever dark place you reside,...

20:59.120 --> 21:00.880
..and that you never return.

21:01.040 --> 21:05.360
Because you know if I did return
that I would break your damn neck.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.120
But of course you could just
touch that lovely ring,...

21:09.280 --> 21:11.280
..and we'd all be struck down again.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.000
Ah, the ring.
This has been handed down...

21:14.120 --> 21:18.200
..through generations of village canons
who came before me.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.600
And with it you maintain power.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.720
With it I abide by God's will...
as best I can.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.920
Sacrifices must be made.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.120
Why?

21:31.280 --> 21:36.520
Do you deny the demon is real? Do you
deny it could destroy us if it so wished?

21:39.080 --> 21:44.080
The sacrifice has allowed the people of
this village to survive for generations.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.720
Just as the wheat is
separated from the chaff,...

21:47.880 --> 21:51.400
..the unclean souls among us
must be taken away.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.040
Through the Circle of Darkness. For ever.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.560
And you decide?

21:57.720 --> 21:59.640
Yes, I do.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.360
Now go thy way. Trouble me no more.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.040
I am sorry.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.880
You know, Simon,...

22:29.040 --> 22:33.000
..your village canon has an awfully
interesting way of tending the flock.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.520
Speak no more of this.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.520
He maintains power
by controlling who gets sacrificed.

22:37.680 --> 22:42.320
No more! I have asked for this
dispensation and he has granted it.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.560
Where's our gear?

23:11.720 --> 23:14.800
If I were to bring it to you,
would you help us?

23:16.720 --> 23:18.320
Help you?

23:20.440 --> 23:22.800
You can bury the Stargate
after we've gone.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.120
- That should prevent the Unas...
- I cannot do that!

23:26.280 --> 23:28.880
- There must be other people...
- I mean the circle.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.400
We are not allowed to go near it,
or even look upon it.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.040
Simon?

23:35.200 --> 23:39.120
- We are ready.
- I shall be there.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.600
- Ready? Ready for what?
- The trepanning ritual.

23:47.200 --> 23:51.480
Mary's parents were taken
in a sacrifice a year ago.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.520
They asked that I care for her.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.280
If you're not willing to help,
it falls to me...

23:57.440 --> 24:00.080
..to try to cleanse her soul
before the canon chooses.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.080
You can't do that.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.240
- I have no choice.
- You'll kill her.

24:05.400 --> 24:10.400
Better that she die among us
than at the hands of the devil himself.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.600
- Jack...
- No!

24:16.760 --> 24:20.800
We can't condemn a girl just because
one man has made a pact with the devil.

24:23.560 --> 24:28.200
Teal'c will have died for nothing
if nothing good comes from this.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.520
(whimpers)

24:44.960 --> 24:48.720
There shall be a great reward
waiting for you in heaven.

24:48.880 --> 24:52.400
And the angels will welcome you
with joyful hearts.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.280
And there will be no more pain.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.720
I know.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.600
OK, I'll tell you what.
You guys start back without me.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.600
I'm gonna go see if I can stop them
drilling a hole in the head of a young girl.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.480
(whimpers)

25:39.640 --> 25:41.160
Wait!

25:47.720 --> 25:51.600
We'll take you back with us.
Mary, too.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.000
Where we come from
there are no demons.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.720
Good choice.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.280
Fever's down. Feeling any better?

26:47.880 --> 26:52.080
Yes. Have you released
that which possessed me?

26:52.240 --> 26:55.040
You got better all by yourself, Mary.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.440
There was never a demon inside you.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.320
So, Simon,...

27:02.480 --> 27:06.960
..you wouldn't happen
to have the keys to these, would you?

27:08.280 --> 27:09.680
Keys?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.600
(screaming)

27:36.240 --> 27:39.160
- (O'Neill) What's that?
- I don't know.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.080
Teal'c! You're... alive?

27:47.520 --> 27:49.920
It is so.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.920
Way to go, junior!

27:57.360 --> 27:59.320
My symbiote did sustain me.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.400
Oxygen in the water.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.160
It's the larval Goa'uld's
natural environment.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.680
It must have filtered the oxygen
and fed it into Teal'c.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.200
You were out for a long time, Teal'c.
We thought we'd lost you.

28:12.360 --> 28:15.880
As they immersed me, I put myself
in a deep state of kelno'reem.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.720
You'd think these folks
never saw a guy rise from the dead!

28:26.280 --> 28:29.800
Simon, l-l know this
must look, um, unusual,...

28:29.960 --> 28:32.760
..but there is
a very logical explanation for this.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.120
(canon) Yes, there is!

28:36.480 --> 28:39.520
There can be no doubt now.
They are evil, all of them!

28:39.680 --> 28:41.760
What do you want? He passed your test.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.520
These four shall be
the first chosen for sacrifice.

28:44.680 --> 28:48.600
Major, next time Daniel gets the urge
to help someone, shoot him.

28:51.240 --> 28:55.640
And with them shall be taken the woman
whose soul has been possessed!

28:55.800 --> 28:58.240
Please! Spare her!

28:58.400 --> 29:01.320
At least allow me to try the trepanning.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.120
You challenge my decision?

29:05.280 --> 29:08.320
- No.
- (Mary) Simon!

29:08.480 --> 29:11.120
Simon, please! Help me!

29:11.280 --> 29:12.200
Simon!

29:15.320 --> 29:19.640
To your homes! Do not let
the demon lay his eyes upon you.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.560
I am sorry, Mary.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.600
Don't apologise to her, help her!

29:43.680 --> 29:46.720
- The canon has spoken.
- What are you? The village idiot?

29:46.880 --> 29:51.600
The demon will turn her into a host.
Do you know what that means?

29:52.080 --> 29:54.080
Of course you don't know
what that means.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.840
I can hear no more of this.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.520
Jack.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.080
Simon, get out here and do something!

30:21.040 --> 30:26.080
Nothing we say will make a difference.
Especially not after Teal'c's resurrection.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.800
(horn blows)

30:33.120 --> 30:35.200
(growling)

30:53.320 --> 30:55.480
Morning.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.520
So...

31:35.680 --> 31:38.080
..how long are you gonna keep this up?

31:41.280 --> 31:44.920
The demon bit? Don't get me wrong,
looks like a great gig.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.000
You got the padre in your back pocket,
the hours are good,...

31:48.160 --> 31:50.360
..you probably
get all the chicks, huh?

31:50.520 --> 31:52.440
Argh!

31:56.440 --> 31:57.760
Oh, my apple!

31:58.280 --> 32:02.840
If they truly are servants of Satan,
why does he resist?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.040
(distorted) You are not of this world.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.360
No... No, we're not.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.960
Uh...

32:12.120 --> 32:17.800
Unas, what does Sokar have on you
that makes you so dang cranky?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.640
Agh!

32:47.400 --> 32:52.000
Mary, we're gonna take a tumble, so just
scrunch up in a ball and roll with us.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.840
(roars)

33:07.200 --> 33:08.400
Go! Go!

33:29.360 --> 33:30.360
Simon!

33:32.680 --> 33:35.440
You've always been quick
to ask questions.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.440
This weakness shall be your undoing.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.240
If you persist...

33:44.400 --> 33:48.960
..l shall be unable to defend you
when the next sacrifice is called.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.239
(distorted) You cannot escape me.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.560
Leave them!

34:14.360 --> 34:16.400
You dare to challenge me?

34:18.080 --> 34:20.560
- Shoot it!
- You shall join them in hell.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.679
Simon!

34:23.840 --> 34:28.120
You will remain here
until I finish with this one.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.400
Shoot it!

34:32.199 --> 34:33.440
Simon!

34:33.600 --> 34:35.199
Shoot!

34:37.159 --> 34:38.560
Again!

34:40.000 --> 34:42.080
(weak roar)

34:43.920 --> 34:45.080
Shoot!

34:47.719 --> 34:49.920
For this you will pay with your life!

34:54.480 --> 34:56.400
Simon!

34:58.360 --> 35:00.480
Mary, the staff!

35:25.080 --> 35:26.840
O'Neill!

35:31.480 --> 35:33.560
(roars)

35:38.480 --> 35:41.120
Carter, Daniel, head toward the gate.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.360
- Take Mary with you.
- (Carter) Yes, sir.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.840
Shall we?

35:49.520 --> 35:50.840
(canon) Simon!

35:51.400 --> 35:53.320
Simon!

35:56.240 --> 35:59.320
- What have you done?
- The demon comes. Release me.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.480
(roars)

36:09.640 --> 36:12.440
(distorted) Your god has abandoned you.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.160
My god... is with me always.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.440
(canon yells)

36:50.960 --> 36:53.040
He's all right. What happened?

36:53.200 --> 36:57.280
Simon... stood before it,
like... Iike David before Goliath.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.920
The demon threw him aside,
and then he fell.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.360
As you can see.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.080
It... was a miracle.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.360
The Unas' wounds were too severe.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.200
Even the Goa'uld within him
could not save him.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.520
So... not a demon.

37:19.680 --> 37:23.960
As you said.
You've opened my eyes. Bless you.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.520
Yeah, well... Let's have the ring.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.920
Yes. Of course.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.400
I am alive?

37:39.560 --> 37:42.880
Sokar will be awaiting the return
of the Unas. He will send others.

37:43.040 --> 37:47.520
Which is why you've got to bury the Circle
of Darkness after we've gone through.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.120
Can you walk?

38:07.440 --> 38:09.360
Simon!

38:11.280 --> 38:14.800
- I knew you would come. Are you hurt?
- I will be fine.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.480
What happened?

38:17.640 --> 38:20.640
The beast... is dead.

38:23.280 --> 38:27.320
Had I not witnessed it myself,
I would not have believed it.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.200
Thank you... all...

38:32.320 --> 38:34.760
..for showing me the way.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.360
You're welcome.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.000
Major, dial us home.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.040
Carter?

38:52.280 --> 38:55.320
It went into him.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.880
What went into him?

38:58.280 --> 39:00.640
Go no further!

39:00.800 --> 39:02.960
Why? I've done nothing.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.040
My children...

39:06.080 --> 39:09.200
- Are you sure?
- Positive, sir. I can sense it.

39:09.360 --> 39:13.520
The Unas host was dying. It had
nowhere else to go. It went into him.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.000
(gasps)

39:36.760 --> 39:39.440
Forgive me.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.840
By the sorrows ye suffered
in your agony in the garden,...

39:52.320 --> 39:54.360
..in the scourging
and crowning with thorns,...

39:54.520 --> 39:58.440
- The prayer for suffering souls.
- ..in your crucifixion and death,...

39:58.600 --> 40:00.520
..have mercy on the souls.

40:01.320 --> 40:05.200
Deliver them from the dire torments
they endure...

40:05.360 --> 40:10.680
..and admit them
to your most sweet embrace in paradise.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.720
Now the demon has truly gone.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.560
Major.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.000
You know what to do?

40:38.160 --> 40:40.960
Yes. We will do what you say.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.760
We will bury the gate - immediately.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.880
And there will be no more sacrifices.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.120
Thank God.
