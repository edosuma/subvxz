WHAT'S WITH THE SHRUB?

00:40.767 --> 00:42.500
WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE OF
MY FAVORITE DUTIES

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
AS HIGH SCHOOL
PRINCIPAL

00:43.500 --> 00:45.667
WAS OVERSEEING THE
HOLIDAY DECORATIONS.

00:45.667 --> 00:48.033
SO I DECIDED
TO CARRY ON
THE TRADITION HERE.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.500

TO MEET MY PARENTS
IN THE BAHAMAS

01:08.667 --> 01:10.200

MESSED UP MY TICKET,

INVITE ANGELA?

03:22.300 --> 03:23.467
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME!

03:23.467 --> 03:25.767
OH, MY GOD. SHAWN'S GONNA
BLAME ME FOR THIS.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.500
HEY, WHY WOULD ANGELA
WANT TO KILL YOU?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.300
HEY, WHY WOULD SHAWN
BLAME YOU?

03:31.300 --> 03:32.767
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT ANGELA.

03:32.767 --> 03:34.400
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT SHAWN.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.734
ALL RIGHT.
ON THE COUNT OF 3.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.300

IN LOVE WITH SHAWN.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.133
I HATE THAT.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

03:42.133 --> 03:43.400
LISTEN, SHE SWORE ME
TO SECRECY.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.834

ABOUT SHAWN.

AFTER THEY BROKE UP.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.500
OH, YAY.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.233
THE ONLY REASON
HE SAID HE WAS OVER HER

03:54.233 --> 03:55.900
WAS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
SHE WAS OVER HIM.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.734
AREN'T YOU
GOING TO SAY YAY?

03:57.734 --> 04:00.467
NO. I DON'T LIKE
TO BE PREDICTABLE.

04:00.467 --> 04:01.700
WE CAN'T EVER
TELL THEM WE KNOW.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.033
WE'LL BETRAY
OUR FRIENDSHIPS.

04:03.033 --> 04:06.200
OK, HERE'S THE PLAN. WE TELL
THEM.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.734
CORY, NO PLANS.
PLEASE TELL ME

04:07.734 --> 04:09.233
WE'LL LET THEM
DO THIS ON THEIR OWN.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.133

AT MY HOUSE.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.367
I MEAN, THIS THING
IS OUT OF OUR HANDS.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.667
SO YOU
WON'T INTERFERE?

04:18.667 --> 04:20.300
IT'S WAY TOO EARLY
TO TELL.

HEY! WE'RE HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
HOPE NO ONE MINDS
A FEW EXTRA PEOPLE.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.100
I'LL GET SOME
SLEEPING BAGS.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.300
HEY, SORRY
I TOOK SO LONG, I--

04:36.500 --> 04:39.033
SHAWN, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.400
WELL...

04:40.400 --> 04:43.000
TOPANGA DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE INVITED ANGELA,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU
I INVITED SHAWN.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.500
HA. NUTTY.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.100
CORY, I'M GOING
TO KILL YOU.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.834
LISTEN, THIS IS
AN INNOCENT MIXUP.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.600
I--I PROMISE.
BUT DON'T LEAVE NOW,

04:54.600 --> 04:56.367
OR SHAWN WILL THINK
IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS
TO ME.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.800
I DIDN'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.000
SAY SHE CAN'T STAY HERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE SECRETLY
IN LOVE WITH HER?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.233
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:03.233 --> 05:04.734
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS
HERE, RIGHT?

05:04.734 --> 05:07.567
FRIENDS WHO SECRETLY LOVE--
THE HOLIDAYS,

05:07.567 --> 05:10.300
AND ON THE HOLIDAYS,
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT WE'RE TOGETHER,

05:10.300 --> 05:12.800
NO MATTER HOW
WE REALLY FEEL
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.600

HAVE TO HIT?

05:49.400 --> 05:51.700
OK, WELL,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:51.700 --> 05:53.600
I JUST WANT
MY PICTURE TAKEN

05:53.600 --> 05:55.200
SO I CAN SEND IT
TO MY GRANDMA

05:55.200 --> 05:57.133
SO SHE SENDS ME
A CHECK.

05:57.133 --> 05:59.033
HMM. AFTER SHE SENDS
THE CHECK,

05:59.033 --> 06:00.667
TELL HER SHE FORGOT
THE CHECK.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.700
WORKS EVERY TIME.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.100

06:22.500 --> 06:23.767
FROM SAINT MARY'S
JUST ARRIVED.

06:23.767 --> 06:26.200
NOW, THESE ARE CHILDREN
WITHOUT PARENTS

06:26.200 --> 06:27.800
AND NO MONEY AT ALL,

06:27.800 --> 06:30.367
SO...YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.767
YEAH.
THAT THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO BUY ANYTHING,

06:32.767 --> 06:35.500
SO GET RID OF THEM
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.867
OH, HERE COMES

06:37.867 --> 06:39.900
HELLO,

06:41.300 --> 06:42.400
WOW.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.800

06:43.800 --> 06:45.734
THAT'S REALLY TOUGH.

06:45.734 --> 06:48.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD GIVE THEM
A LITTLE ATTENTION.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.233
ALL RIGHT.
[CLEARS THROAT]

06:49.233 --> 06:51.867

06:56.233 --> 06:57.467
LUCY.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.500
LUCY.
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS, LUCY?

07:00.500 --> 07:01.700
I DON'T KNOW.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.300
OH, COME ON, LUCY.
THAT'S SANTA.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.667
THANKS, JACK.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.300
IS THAT
SUZY SHOPS-A-LOT?

07:08.300 --> 07:09.967
OH, WELL,
IT CERTAINLY IS.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.300
WHY--WHY DON'T
YOU ASK SANTA
FOR ONE OF THOSE?

07:12.300 --> 07:16.000
WELL, I NEVER GOT ANYTHING
I ASKED SANTA FOR.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.600
I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE ASKING
THE RIGHT SANTA.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.867
WOW, YOU REALLY
ARE SANTA!

07:21.867 --> 07:23.834
HA HA HA.
OHH. SMILE.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.200
THERE YOU GO, LUCY.
THANK YOU.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.934
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
I REALLY AM SANTA.

07:30.934 --> 07:31.967
I KNOW.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.133
OH, YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN YOUR FACES

07:33.133 --> 07:35.467
IN THAT PICTURE.
THEY WERE PRICELESS.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.800
SHE REALLY
BELIEVED IN US.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.567
MAN, YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I LOVE BEING SANTA.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.133
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
JUST, YOU KNOW,
PUTTING ON THE SUIT

07:40.133 --> 07:42.100
AND GETTING THE SUPERPOWERS
AND EVERYTHING.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.500
I MEAN, IT'S A--
I MADE HER HAPPY.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.834
LOOK AT THAT.
I DID THAT.

I KNOW. YOU LOOK
PRETTY HAPPY, TOO,

AHH. ELF BOY,

07:49.567 --> 07:50.767
HERE'S SANTA'S DAD'S
CREDIT CARD.

07:50.767 --> 07:51.934
I WANT YOU TO GO
AND TAKE IT

07:51.934 --> 07:53.100
AND BUY TOYS
FOR ALL THESE KIDS.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.600
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT
TO HELP OUT, TOO.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.767
I'M GOING TO USE
THE MONEY

07:55.767 --> 07:57.767
I WAS GOING TO SPEND
ON THE BAHAMAS TRIP.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.300
I'LL HELP YOU SHOP.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.000
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY, SO...

08:02.467 --> 08:05.300
OK, WHO'S NEXT? TIME'S
A-WASTIN'.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.667
HO HO HO HO.
OH-HO HO HO.

08:08.667 --> 08:12.667
OK, KAREN, LET'S SEE
WHAT SANTA'S GOT
FOR YOU.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.400
SANTA FOR YOU HAS...

08:15.400 --> 08:16.767
THIS BAG.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.567
OOH. OK.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.667
HA HA HA HA.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.133
SMILE.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.300
OK. BYE-BYE, KAREN.
BYE-BYE.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.600
OHH.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.200
SHE WAS GRATEFUL
FOR A BAG.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.367
SHE WAS GRATEFUL
FOR A BAG.

08:29.367 --> 08:30.500
I KNOW. WE DID
REALLY GOOD, SANTA.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.100
YOU MAKE ME PROUD
TO BE MRS. CLAUS.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.934
YOU KNOW,
SPENDING MY MONEY
FOR THOSE PRESENTS

08:34.934 --> 08:37.100
WAS BETTER THAN ANY TRIP
I COULD'VE TAKEN.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.400
I'M REALLY PROUD
TO BE YOUR ELF.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.233
WELL, YOU KNOW
SOMETHING?
YOU GUYS GET READY

08:40.233 --> 08:41.300
TO BE PROUD
TOMORROW,

08:41.300 --> 08:42.734
BECAUSE WE ARE JUST
STARTING HERE.

08:42.734 --> 08:44.667
I WILL NOT REST
UNTIL EVERY NEEDY KID

08:44.667 --> 08:45.767
GETS WHAT THEY ASK FOR.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.033
UH-OH.
ERIC, NOBODY
EXPECTS YOU

08:47.033 --> 08:48.734
TO TAKE CARE OF ALL
THE NEEDY CHILDREN.

08:48.734 --> 08:50.000
THEN WHY WERE THEY
SENT TO ME?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.400
OH, BOY.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.734
ERIC, WE'RE OUT
OF MONEY.

08:52.734 --> 08:54.400
YEAH. SEE, WE'VE DONE
ALL THAT WE CAN DO.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.834
NO, I'M SORRY.
SANTA WILL NOT
ACCEPT THAT, ELF.

08:57.834 --> 08:58.967
OK.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.934
I'M TELLING YOU.
WE'RE OUT OF TOYS.

09:00.934 --> 09:02.967
WE JUST GOT TO GET
A LITTLE CREATIVE.

09:02.967 --> 09:04.233
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE

09:04.233 --> 09:05.567
THAT WE GET
CREATIVE?

09:05.567 --> 09:08.900
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED HIM THAT.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.667
OH, WOW. MR. FEENY,
THAT'S A LOT OF FRUITCAKE.

09:19.667 --> 09:22.800
YEAH, I WASN'T ABLE
TO HAND OUT GIFTS
TO MY NEW COLLEAGUES.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.000
OH, YEAH,
I'LL TAKE THOSE
OFF YOUR HANDS.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.100
HERE. THROW THEM
IN HERE, MAN.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.667
APPARENTLY THE TRADITION
AT PENNBROOK

09:27.667 --> 09:30.400
IS TO BEAT IT
OUT OF TOWN

09:30.400 --> 09:32.100
AS FAST AS HUMANLY
POSSIBLE.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.700
THAT'S IT?

09:33.700 --> 09:35.767
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?
JUST THE FRUITCAKE?

09:35.767 --> 09:37.700
YES.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.300
WELL, AT LEAST
THERE IS ONE TRADITION
THAT IS SACRED.

09:41.300 --> 09:44.233
I SHALL NOW HANG UP
MY TRADITIONAL

09:44.233 --> 09:45.767
WISE-SANTA ORNAMENT.

09:48.033 --> 09:49.500
BUT--

09:49.500 --> 09:50.700
OOH.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.867
JEEZ. I'M SORRY,
MR. FEENY.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.600
OH, WELL, NOT TO WORRY.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.200
I'LL SIMPLY
FIND A SUBSTITUTE.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.567
LIKE THIS SHINY
RED BALL.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.367
HOW SPECIAL.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.000
ALL ABOARD
FOR SANTALAND.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.567
ERIC,
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.600
HEY, WE WERE GOING
TO SPEND THIS TOGETHER
AS A FAMILY.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.000
I'M SANTA.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.967
HEY!
HEY!

10:15.967 --> 10:17.867
OH, MY GOSH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.967
AND YOU? HEY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:19.967 --> 10:21.967
HOW ARE YOU?

10:21.967 --> 10:23.600
I NEVER SEE THEM.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.867
HEY, KIDS.
HOW WAS ICE SKATING?

10:25.867 --> 10:27.500
YULETIDES
OF FUN, MOM.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.100
BUT WHO KNEW
IT WOULD BE COUPLES ONLY?

10:30.100 --> 10:32.000
I DIDN'T, I SWEAR.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.367
CORY?

10:35.367 --> 10:37.467
WILL YOU PLEASE
STAY OUT OF THIS?

10:37.467 --> 10:38.500
WHEN YOU AND I
BROKE UP,

10:38.500 --> 10:39.667
SHAWN DID EVERYTHING
IN HIS POWER

10:39.667 --> 10:40.934
TO GET US
BACK TOGETHER.

10:40.934 --> 10:42.100
NOW IT'S CHRISTMAS.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.200
CAN YOU THINK
OF A BETTER GIFT

10:43.200 --> 10:44.667
THAN DOING
THE SAME THING
FOR THEM?

10:44.667 --> 10:46.300
I KNOW YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD.
JUST DON'T PUSH SO HARD.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.033
OK.
I'LL BE MORE SUBTLE.

10:48.033 --> 10:50.233
ALL RIGHT!
WHO WANTS TO STRING
SOME POPCORN?

10:50.233 --> 10:52.200
SHAWN AND ANGELA!

10:52.200 --> 10:53.767
HEY, CORY,
I ALWAYS STRING--

10:53.767 --> 10:54.834
HERE YOU GO.

10:54.834 --> 10:56.300
PLEASE?

10:59.567 --> 11:01.300
SO, YOU AND ME.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.834
STRINGING POPCORN.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.133
GO FOR IT.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.967
NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.000
OK.

11:12.467 --> 11:16.233
ANGELA, I'M NOT SORRY
THAT WE'RE SPENDING
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.600
I'M NOT EITHER.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.200
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.467
TREE IS READY.
GATHER AROUND

11:21.467 --> 11:23.467
AND I'LL LIGHT
THE CHRISTMAS
LIGHTS.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.233
OH, UH,
SHAWN AND ANGELA,

11:25.233 --> 11:28.500
THE--THE TREE
LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER
FROM RIGHT UP HERE.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.600
RIGHT UP
ON THAT STEP.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.100
OH. WHAT'S THAT?
MISTLETOE?

11:33.867 --> 11:35.800
COULD HE BE
ANY MORE OBVIOUS?

11:35.800 --> 11:37.000
YEAH, LIKE
THE ICE SKATING

11:37.000 --> 11:38.800
AND CAROLING
WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.500
WHAT'S HE THINK,
A LITTLE HOLIDAY SPIRIT

11:40.500 --> 11:43.200
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO FALL
INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.500
[GASPS] OHH.
OHH.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.967
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.400
I LOVE CHRISTMAS.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
WHAT?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.000
YOU KISSED ANGELA.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.300
CORY, DON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL
OUT OF THIS.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.200
SHAWNY,
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.667
NO, NOT THIS TIME.
SHE'S OVER ME,

12:21.667 --> 12:22.800
WE ARE OVER
EACH OTHER.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.000
WHY WON'T YOU
LET THIS GO?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.734
BECAUSE ANGELA'S
STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

12:25.734 --> 12:27.367
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BREAK UP WITH YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

12:27.367 --> 12:28.500
AND I KNOW
YOU WROTE THAT POEM

12:28.500 --> 12:29.800
BECAUSE YOU STILL
LOVE HER.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.567
WHAT?

12:31.567 --> 12:33.100
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

12:33.100 --> 12:34.467
SOMEONE TOLD ME.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.767
I MEAN,
NO ONE TOLD ME.

12:36.767 --> 12:37.934
I MEAN...

12:37.934 --> 12:39.400
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.000
PLEASE DON'T
TAKE ME TO TOPANGA.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.133
PLEASE.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.734
OK. I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.967
TOPANGA, WHAT
DID YOU TELL HIM?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.934
CORY.
ANGELA,

12:48.934 --> 12:51.367
I TOLD SHAWN THAT YOU
STILL LOVE HIM,

12:51.367 --> 12:52.700
AND I KNOW TOPANGA
WAS TELLING YOU

12:52.700 --> 12:54.500
THAT SHAWN
STILL LOVES YOU...

12:54.500 --> 12:55.767
WHAT?

12:55.767 --> 12:58.100
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
ANYTHING, DID YOU?

12:58.100 --> 13:00.200
NO. NO, I DIDN'T.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.700
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.967
WELL, I'M THINKING
NOW'S A GOOD TIME.

13:06.734 --> 13:09.100
SOMEBODY BETTER
START TALKING,

13:09.100 --> 13:11.667
AND I THINK
IT SHOULD BE
YOU AND ME.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.700
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.200
GUYS, WAIT.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.100
I COULDN'T SEE
THEIR FACES.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.734
DID THEY LOOK ANGRY?

13:21.734 --> 13:24.133
OOH, YES, LIKE THAT.

13:26.033 --> 13:29.834
HAS ANYONE SEEN
MY TOASTER OVEN?

13:29.834 --> 13:31.800
HO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.567
THE EASY-BAKE OVEN
IS FOR ROOKIES.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.000
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
SANTA GAVE YOU

13:37.000 --> 13:40.934
YOUR VERY OWN
TOASTER OVEN?

13:40.934 --> 13:42.133
ALL RIGHT.

13:42.133 --> 13:43.767
HERE WE GO.

13:43.767 --> 13:47.200
OK. BYE-BYE, NOW.
BYE-BYE.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.800
LOOK HOW HAPPY
SHE IS ABOUT
THE TOASTER OVEN.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.500
I AM TELLING
YOU SOMETHING,

13:52.500 --> 13:53.700
CHRISTMAS
IS THE GREATEST IDEA

13:53.700 --> 13:55.367
ANYBODY EVER HAD.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.734
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
I'M ALL OUT
OF STUFF HERE.

13:57.734 --> 14:01.200
MADE ALL THESE
LITTLE KIDS HAPPY.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.400
YOU'RE A GREAT SANTA.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.600
HEY, AND YOU'RE
A GREAT ELF,

14:03.600 --> 14:05.200
AND I AM
A GREAT SANTA.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.100
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

14:07.100 --> 14:09.300
I WANT THE WORLD'S
HAPPINESS TO BE
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.500
WHAT A GREAT JOB.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.300
HA HA HA HA HA.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.934
OH, EXCUSE ME,
SANTA CLAUS.

14:14.934 --> 14:16.367
YES, MRS. CLAUS?

14:16.367 --> 14:17.367
I THINK
THE LITTLE BOY

14:17.367 --> 14:18.567
NEEDS TO SPEAK
WITH YOU.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.200
OH, OH, OF COURSE.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.500
THAT'S WHAT
SANTA'S HERE FOR.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.400
COME ON UP,
LITTLE ONE.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.000
OH, COME UP HERE,
MY LITTLE--

14:27.000 --> 14:29.200
HEY, YOU LOOK
FAMILIAR. ARE YOU
IN MY PSYCH CLASS?

14:29.200 --> 14:31.834
I WAS HERE YESTERDAY.
MY NAME'S TOMMY.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.600
YEAH, SANTA, HE CAME WITH
THE OTHER CHILDREN ON THE BUS.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.200
OH--OH, TOMMY!

14:37.200 --> 14:38.500
OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.033
I REMEMBER YOU.
I GAVE YOU THE TRUCK.

14:41.033 --> 14:43.367
YEAH, AND I CAME
TO GIVE IT BACK.

14:43.367 --> 14:44.967
WELL, WHY? WHAT'S
WRONG WITH IT?

14:44.967 --> 14:47.100
NOTHING.
IT'S WHAT I WANTED.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.400
WELL, THEN
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.600
I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE
YOU WERE SANTA,

14:50.600 --> 14:53.800
BUT ALL MY FRIENDS
CAME BACK WITH STUFF.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.133
SO NOW THAT I KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY HIM,

14:57.133 --> 14:59.800
I WAS WONDERING IF I CAN
GIVE THIS BACK

14:59.800 --> 15:02.100
AND ASK FOR SOMETHING
ELSE INSTEAD.

15:02.100 --> 15:05.767
OF COURSE YOU CAN, TOMMY.
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.767
REALLY?
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

15:07.767 --> 15:09.700
WHAT DO YOU NEED, TOMMY?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.567
DO YOU THINK I CAN HAVE
PARENTS FOR CHRISTMAS?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.600
I THOUGHT JUST ABOUT
EVERYBODY

15:30.600 --> 15:34.100
WOULD BE OUT
CELEBRATING BY NOW.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.967
OH, WELL.
THANKS.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.400
THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:45.467 --> 15:48.100
SO WHY CAN'T WE JUST TELL
EACH OTHER HOW WE FEEL?

15:48.100 --> 15:50.667
I DON'T KNOW.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.233
IT'S CONFUSING, HUH?

15:52.233 --> 15:55.133
YEAH. WE BROKE UP.
WE AGREED TO MOVE ON.

15:55.133 --> 15:58.567
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
WE'RE KISSING
UNDER THE MISTLETOE.

15:58.567 --> 16:01.400
YEAH, AND LETTING CORY TELL US
HOW WE SHOULD FEEL.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.233
WHEN WE'RE NOT
EVEN SURE OURSELVES.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.900
OH, NO, SHAWN.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.867
I'M SURE.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.500
I LOVE YOU.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.667
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.400
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE SURE ABOUT
WHAT YOU FELT.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.233
WELL,

16:21.233 --> 16:24.800
WHEN WE BROKE UP,
I THOUGHT I WANTED
TO BE FREE,

16:24.800 --> 16:28.233
BUT I COULDN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.200
THAT SCARES ME.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.133
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO
WITH THOSE FEELINGS.

16:33.133 --> 16:36.000
YOU GIVE IN TO THEM,
SHAWN...

16:36.000 --> 16:37.600
BECAUSE THEN
YOU'D BE IN LOVE

16:37.600 --> 16:39.467
WITH SOMEONE
WHO LOVES YOU, TOO.

16:39.467 --> 16:42.400
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.300
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL
PERSON, ANGELA.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.667
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU WANT, SHAWN?

16:45.667 --> 16:47.734
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

16:47.734 --> 16:49.300
I'M SO CONFUSED, OK?

16:49.300 --> 16:52.567
I DON'T THINK--
I REALLY DON'T
THINK I'M READY.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.500
I OPENED MY HEART
TO YOU.

16:59.734 --> 17:02.133
I JUST CAN'T SIT AROUND
LIKE A FOOL,

17:02.133 --> 17:04.300
WAITING FOR YOU
TO BE READY.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.767
ANGELA...

17:15.033 --> 17:16.300
I'M DONE.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.767
IT'S OVER, SHAWN.

17:32.033 --> 17:34.300
I WANT TO MAKE
THE HAPPINESS

17:34.300 --> 17:37.600
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.133
WHAT AN IDIOT.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.600
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

17:48.767 --> 17:50.700
I MADE ALL THOSE
LITTLE KIDS SMILE,

17:50.700 --> 17:53.000
TOOK CARE OF EVERYBODY
THAT CAME TO SEE ME.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.033
NO DISRESPECT,

17:56.033 --> 17:59.400
BUT WHY WOULD YOU
SEND ME THAT LITTLE BOY?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.400
WHY DOESN'T THAT NICE
LITTLE BOY HAVE PARENTS?

18:04.400 --> 18:07.100
WHY DOESN'T THAT NICE
LITTLE BOY HAVE PARENTS?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.400
WHY DID YOU SEND ME
THAT LITTLE KID?

18:16.600 --> 18:19.200
AND WHY DO I ONLY
COME TO YOU

18:19.200 --> 18:20.600
WHEN I NEED SOMETHING?

18:23.233 --> 18:25.767
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

18:28.100 --> 18:31.300
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF THIS.

18:36.567 --> 18:39.900
I CAN BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE HAPPINESS
OF ONE LITTLE BOY.

18:45.934 --> 18:48.734
WHAT COULD BE
TAKING THEM SO LONG?

18:48.734 --> 18:50.400
I LOVE YOU.
YOU LOVE ME.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.667
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.
LET'S THANK CORY
AND TOPANGA.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.200
I MEAN, THAT'S
10 MINUTES, TOPS.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.500
GUYS, DO WE HAVE
TO WAIT FOR ERIC

18:55.500 --> 18:56.800
TO OPEN
OUR PRESENTS?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.867
NO, HONEY. YOU'VE BEEN
PATIENT LONG ENOUGH.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.233
HOW ABOUT EACH ONE
OF US OPEN ONE?

19:01.233 --> 19:02.300
OK.

19:05.367 --> 19:06.600
HEY, MINE'S EMPTY.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.100
"YOUR 75-BIT POWER DRILL
WAS DONATED

19:09.100 --> 19:12.200
TO A CHILD IN NEED.
LOVE, SANTA CLAUS."

19:12.200 --> 19:17.300
"HE ALSO GAVE AWAY
MY BREAST PUMP."

19:17.300 --> 19:20.500
OOH. THIS IS FOR YOU.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.600
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.200
I DO. WHERE'S ERIC?

19:25.200 --> 19:27.367
HE, UH...
I, UM...

19:27.367 --> 19:30.467
OH, THE KIDS
WERE JUST SO CUTE,
YOU KNOW.

19:30.467 --> 19:31.834
IT WASN'T JUST HIM,
WE ALL--

19:31.834 --> 19:32.900
YEAH, YEAH. SEE,
HERE'S THE THING.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.500
HAVE YOU EVER REALLY
GOTTEN CAUGHT UP

19:34.500 --> 19:36.200
IN THE SPIRIT
OF CHRISTMAS,

19:36.200 --> 19:38.500
SO MUCH SO THAT YOU
WANT TO...STEAL?

19:41.700 --> 19:42.700
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
EVERYBODY.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.767
HOW YOU DOING?

19:43.767 --> 19:47.300
THIS IS--IT'S OK.
COME ON IN.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.567
THIS IS TOMMY.

19:51.567 --> 19:52.800
HI.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.800
WELL, HI, TOMMY.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.700
DO YOU HAVE MY
75-BIT POWER DRILL?

19:58.700 --> 20:01.500
ERIC, WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.000
WELL, YOU SEE,
TOMMY HERE DOESN'T
HAVE A FAMILY,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.233
SO I THOUGHT
IT'D BE NICE

20:05.233 --> 20:06.667
IF HE COULD SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH US.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.600
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S OK
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.000
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.934
YEAH. HEY, TOMMY,
DO YOU LIKE
GINGERBREAD COOKIES?

20:11.934 --> 20:14.834
YEAH.
SO DO I.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.233
YEP, TOMMY AND I MET
WHEN I WAS SANTA.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.900
HE THOUGHT
I WAS REALLY SANTA.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.000
NOW I KNOW
HE'S ERIC.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
YEAH. HE SAID WE COULD
STILL HANG OUT, THOUGH.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.834
ERIC SAID
WE CAN HANG OUT
ON WEEKENDS.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.834
YEAH, IT'LL BE LIKE
HE'S GOT A BIG BROTHER.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.800
WELL, HE'S A GOOD
ONE, TOMMY.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.700
FIGURED IT WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.500
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
ERIC.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.133
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
TOMMY.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.133
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.133
"MARLEY WAS DEAD,
TO BEGIN WITH.

20:47.133 --> 20:49.900
"THERE IS NO DOUBT
WHATEVER ABOUT THAT.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.367
"THE REGISTER
OF HIS BURIAL WAS SIGNED

20:52.367 --> 20:55.300
"BY THE CLERGYMAN,
THE CLERK,

20:55.300 --> 20:58.100
"THE UNDERTAKER,
AND THE CHIEF MOURNER.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.300
"SCROOGE SIGNED IT,

21:00.300 --> 21:03.000
"AND SCROOGE'S NAME
WAS GOOD UPON CHANGE

21:03.000 --> 21:05.934
"FOR ANYTHING HE CHOSE
TO PUT HIS HAND TO.

21:05.934 --> 21:08.300
OLD MARLEY WAS..."

21:09.967 --> 21:12.500
"AS DEAD AS A DOORNAIL."
