WEBVTT

00:05.715 --> 00:08.718
- Hi, Mickey, alcoholic.
- Hi, Mickey.

00:08.802 --> 00:12.388
Um... I'm doing good,
doing the work.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.558
This weekend was...

00:14.641 --> 00:16.434
weird, tough.

00:16.518 --> 00:18.227
My friends had this party,

00:18.311 --> 00:19.563
and let's just say...

00:19.646 --> 00:21.773
I let things get out of hand.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.358
I didn't drink.
I'm still sober,

00:24.442 --> 00:27.070
but it was the first time
in a super long time

00:27.153 --> 00:28.446
that I felt like getting fucked up,

00:28.530 --> 00:31.074
so I thought I should
bring myself to a meeting.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.336
-Mickey? Mickey!
-Oh! Hey, Dianne!

00:43.419 --> 00:45.589
Yeah, I thought I saw you in there.

00:45.672 --> 00:47.841
Hey, beautiful.
Oh, it feels like forever.

00:47.924 --> 00:50.802
Yeah.
Uh, work and everything, yeah.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.597
-You wanna smoke?
-Uh, no. I quit.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.599
- Oh, good for you!
- Yeah, I know.

00:55.682 --> 00:57.058
So how are you?
How are things with you?

00:57.141 --> 00:58.768
- They're good?
- Yeah.

00:58.852 --> 01:00.770
Yeah, do they not seem good?

01:00.854 --> 01:02.606
No, no! I just... Um...

01:02.689 --> 01:06.484
You know,
what you said in there, and...

01:06.568 --> 01:07.819
and I know.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.572
I know. I've been there, sweetie.
So, you know what?

01:10.655 --> 01:13.742
If you feel like picking up a drink,
you pick up the phone instead,

01:13.825 --> 01:15.368
'cause I know
you have my number.

01:15.952 --> 01:17.536
- Don't file it--
- Dial it.

01:17.621 --> 01:18.622
-Yes, I know.
-Yes.

01:18.705 --> 01:19.914
-Okay.
-You're right, you're right. I will.

01:19.998 --> 01:22.291
I know, I know,
everybody hates making the calls,

01:22.375 --> 01:24.836
but I'd love to hear from you.
I really would.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.420
And I will do that.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.506
You know, it's amazing
how many things you can get done

01:28.589 --> 01:31.300
when you take out that part of your brain
that's focused on not getting high.

01:31.384 --> 01:32.468
Right.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.096
I'm just getting to know myself.

01:36.014 --> 01:37.724
It's the longest
I've ever been single.

01:37.807 --> 01:40.769
It's so nice to not be seeking
all these outside things,

01:40.852 --> 01:43.938
you know, like drinks or guys or...

01:44.022 --> 01:47.483
You know, I-- I've just been
so distracted by being happy.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.169
Okay.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.253
Okay.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.076
Mickey, you decent?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.578
Yeah, I'm just changing
my pillowcases.

02:40.662 --> 02:41.913
I should change my pillow.

02:41.996 --> 02:42.997
Do you know,
after five years,

02:43.081 --> 02:44.999
half the weight of your pillow's,
like, bugs?

02:45.083 --> 02:47.501
-What's up?
-I just wanted to get my jacket.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.045
Oh, my God.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.755
Bertie...

02:50.839 --> 02:52.006
you look fucking hot.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.092
-Really?
-Very hot.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.177
Thank you.
Um, can I get my jacket?

02:56.260 --> 02:57.971
Oh, the denim one? Yeah.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.264
So, uh, are you stoked for tonight?

03:00.348 --> 03:02.350
-Yeah. A little nervous.
-What?

03:02.433 --> 03:05.186
No! You shouldn't be.
Gus is a sweetheart.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.562
I have a really good feeling about this.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.564
Well, you know what?
I've been thinking about it,

03:08.647 --> 03:10.274
and I have high hopes.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.985
That's the spirit.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.778
And thank you so much
for setting this up.

03:13.862 --> 03:16.697
It makes me feel good,
'cause I know you think he's nice,

03:16.781 --> 03:19.367
which means you think I'm nice,
so I'm on your nice list.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.660
So, it's like that thing
where if someone says to you,

03:21.745 --> 03:24.080
"Hey, do you have someone nice
you can set my friend up with?"

03:24.163 --> 03:25.749
-That's me.
-Yeah.

03:25.832 --> 03:27.375
I'm a very big fan of Bertie.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.794
And you deserve to be
with a guy like Gus.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.212
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

03:32.130 --> 03:34.382
So, what's going on?
Are you guys going to dinner?

03:34.465 --> 03:36.217
-I think so.
-Anything after?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.677
I dunno. Maybe we'll hang out.
Should we come back here?

03:38.762 --> 03:40.346
Will you be here?
Or asleep?

03:40.429 --> 03:41.848
I'll just keep my door closed,

03:41.931 --> 03:43.808
and text me, "Had a good night,"
on your way home,

03:43.892 --> 03:45.309
and I'll know you guys
are gonna do it.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.978
Oh, I couldn't move that fast.

03:47.061 --> 03:50.356
Also, my period ended yesterday,
so I really don't feel like...

03:50.439 --> 03:52.191
I don't know,
maybe I should just suck him off?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.736
I can't tell you whether or not
to blow somebody.

03:54.819 --> 03:55.987
I can't be held responsible.

03:56.529 --> 03:58.740
Do you give blowjobs on a first date?

03:58.823 --> 04:01.325
Um, I have given blowjobs
on a first date.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.995
I've only done it twice,
and neither turned out ideal.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.621
I mean, I don't want to be
the kind of person

04:05.704 --> 04:07.165
who doesn't give blowjobs,

04:07.248 --> 04:08.917
but if they're not any good...

04:09.417 --> 04:12.045
Who cares? I should give more.
I deserve to have fun.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.629
Fuck, yeah.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.757
I mean, I don't know why
I make such a big deal out of it.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.218
Everyone says that blowjobs are,
like, the new making out.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.304
Look, there are risks either way.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.639
I gave a guy an amazing blowjob
on a first date,

04:23.722 --> 04:25.433
and he wouldn't stop calling me
for three years.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.937
I couldn't shake him.
So there are pros to giving a bad blowjob.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.441
What?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.693
You look so pretty.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.993
Oh, he's almost here.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.538
-Um...
-You know what? Don't worry about it.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.706
Just finish getting ready.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.541
-I will answer the door.
-Thank you.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.379
-Oh, hey, Gus. Come on in.
-Hey.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.672
Bertie's still getting ready.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.674
Okay. Sure.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.676
Yeah, sorry,
I'm a little early.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.928
You always are.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.513
Yes. It's my trademark.

05:04.597 --> 05:07.016
So, you gonna take Bertie out to dinner?

05:07.100 --> 05:09.018
Yeah. Yeah, we're going to this place...

05:09.102 --> 05:11.479
uh, Tucker's, it's called.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.356
Tucker's. I never heard of it.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.648
Yeah, I hadn't either.

05:14.732 --> 05:17.610
But a foodie friend of mine,
she usually knows what's up,

05:17.693 --> 05:18.903
and she told me to go, so...

05:18.987 --> 05:21.865
-Ugh.
-What? What are you reading?

05:21.948 --> 05:23.992
I'm not reading a good review on Yelp.

05:24.075 --> 05:28.037
Oh. Oh.
"The calamari seemed frozen."

05:28.121 --> 05:31.749
--Shit. That's not good, hmm?

05:31.833 --> 05:33.042
Mmm, you know what?

05:33.126 --> 05:35.794
Fuck it, 'cause this is usually
just one pissed off dude

05:35.879 --> 05:39.090
who had a bad experience
and then wrote, like, 50 bad reviews.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.799
Oh, that's nice of you to say,

05:40.884 --> 05:42.760
but I don't think Yelp
allows you to do that.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.137
Oh, you'd be surprised.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.679
This dry cleaner fucked up my jacket,

05:45.763 --> 05:47.681
and I created all these
fake email addresses,

05:47.765 --> 05:49.017
and wrote all these bad reviews.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.977
It took all day,
but it felt great.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.688
Oh. Well, do me a favor.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.732
Go on to Yelp and, uh,
write some good reviews

05:56.815 --> 05:58.026
for this fucking dump we're going to.

05:58.109 --> 05:59.818
- Can do.
- All right. Good.

05:59.903 --> 06:01.695
What are you two giggling about?

06:01.779 --> 06:03.781
Oh, uh, nothing.

06:03.864 --> 06:09.078
Uh, Mickey was saying that the place
we're going to is, uh, not so good.

06:09.162 --> 06:12.999
So, uh, I guess there's
some bad Yelp reviews.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.126
But maybe we should go
somewhere else then?

06:15.209 --> 06:16.710
-I don't know.
-No, I think that's good.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.754
Let's go and let's just see
what it's like.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.965
And even if it's bad,
we should write a good review

06:21.049 --> 06:22.050
because we're nice.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.468
Yes, I agree. Perfect.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.387
Well, should we, uh...

06:26.470 --> 06:27.763
should we hit the road?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.015
- Let's do it.
- All right.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.935
--Oh, my God. You're so cute. Look at this.

06:32.018 --> 06:35.229
In a year, I'm gonna be bragging
that I introduced you at your wedding.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.941
-Oh, well I...
-Oh.

06:38.024 --> 06:40.109
Oh, did I make it weird?
I made it weird.

06:40.193 --> 06:42.695
-No.
-No. No.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.613
-Let's go.
-Okay, cool.

06:44.697 --> 06:47.366
Just a heads up,
my car sort of smells like McDonald's.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.534
Oh, great!

06:51.495 --> 06:53.331
Sorry, I slammed that door
harder than I meant to.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.374
- It's fine. It's just a door.
- Right.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.962
-Here's your table.
-Thank you.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.129
Thank you.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.466
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.052
-Thank you.
-And your waiter will be right with you.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.845
-Oh, great. Thank you.
-Awesome. Thank you.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.055
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.223
Thanks a lot.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.475
Wow.

07:13.977 --> 07:16.104
-Nice place.
-I know, right?

07:16.187 --> 07:17.771
-Fancy.
-Yeah.

07:19.023 --> 07:22.110
And, um, you look great,
by the way.

07:22.193 --> 07:25.238
Aw, thank you.
You look really nice, too.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.073
Aw, thanks.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.867
We both clean up good.
We should be proud.

07:29.951 --> 07:34.913
So I lend this bag of dicks
$5,000, okay?

07:34.998 --> 07:37.416
Says, "Can I pay you back
in three months?"

07:37.500 --> 07:39.961
I don't even think about it.
I keep my mouth shut.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.713
Three months go past,
I don't have any money in my pocket,

07:42.796 --> 07:45.049
and the motherfucker comes up to me

07:45.133 --> 07:46.592
and he asked me for another two grand.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.843
- No, he didn't!
- You wanna look at him?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.513
I have a very strong mental image
of what he looks like,

07:50.596 --> 07:52.306
so I really don't need
to actually look at him.

07:52.390 --> 07:55.559
-Oh, what is it?
-A flat, four-foot...

07:55.643 --> 07:59.063
-Mmm-hmm.
-...but very big, very wide,

07:59.147 --> 08:00.523
but very small man.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.316
Like, a sleeveless t-shirt,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.152
and one of those, like,
you know those things

08:04.235 --> 08:06.029
that miners wear with,
like, the light on?

08:06.112 --> 08:08.156
-Sure. Yeah.
-Yeah. No pants.

08:08.239 --> 08:10.699
- All to a tee.

08:10.783 --> 08:12.618
Good evening.
My name is Ben.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.911
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello.

08:13.995 --> 08:15.413
Just so you know,
we have a special tonight,

08:15.496 --> 08:19.417
the steak, dry-aged 30 days,
Wagyu beef,

08:19.500 --> 08:22.336
mint on top, medium rare.
It melts in your mouth.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.630
I had it last night
and it knocked me out.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.632
-Wow, that sounds so good.
-Yeah.

08:26.715 --> 08:27.841
I'll give you guys some time.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.011
Can I start you with some water?
Sparkling? Tap?

08:30.094 --> 08:32.180
- Uh... tap?
- Oh, yeah, sparkling.

08:35.641 --> 08:36.767
Sparkling.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.727
-Yeah, cool.
-Okay. I'll be right back.

08:38.811 --> 08:41.105
-Great. Great.
-Thank you. Thanks, again.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.238
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.579
This kid die or what?

09:15.223 --> 09:17.516
Get-- Grandpa!
Stop eating yourself out.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.185
Get out of here!

09:25.566 --> 09:28.194
And now, you're just
a few steps away from having your home

09:28.277 --> 09:30.238
just the way you want it.

09:30.321 --> 09:32.448
Now on to design tip number 15:

09:32.531 --> 09:36.535
maximizing living space by limiting
yourself to just a few large items.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.246
I like to use the three-day rule.

09:38.329 --> 09:41.124
Start by removing anything
you don't use in three days.

09:41.207 --> 09:43.917
That will help you get rid
of all unwanted clutter.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.546
You'll find that moving only
one or two items will get the job done.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.382
And that's all there is to it.

09:49.465 --> 09:52.510
Following these steps will give you
the living room of your dreams.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.470
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.722
And can I get you guys started
with some drinks?

09:56.805 --> 10:00.643
Yeah. I'd love to get a glass of red wine,
if there's anything you could recommend.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.729
Yeah, yeah. We have a NorCal Malbec
that I'm quite fond of,

10:03.812 --> 10:05.148
-right there.
-Oh, great.

10:05.231 --> 10:09.152
-And for you, sir?
-Um, yeah, could I just get a sea breeze?

10:09.235 --> 10:10.694
-Sea breeze.
-Yeah.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.863
-I can hook you up.
-Cool.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.742
- Great. Nice guy.
- Very cool. Very cool.

10:16.825 --> 10:20.204
- A little cold in here.
- Yeah.

10:20.288 --> 10:22.039
I just noticed there's, like,
an air conditioning vent,

10:22.123 --> 10:23.166
like, right above you.

10:23.249 --> 10:25.418
It's just blasting cold air on you.
Are you okay?

10:25.501 --> 10:26.752
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.754
-Do you wanna switch seats or--
-No, no, please. I'm fine.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.048
-You want my jacket?
-I'm absolutely fine, but thank you.

10:31.132 --> 10:32.508
Okay. Just let me know.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.427
I mean,
if you get uncomfortable or anything...

10:40.224 --> 10:42.310
Uh, so you were saying you're a tutor?

10:42.393 --> 10:44.603
I'm sorry, what?
I didn't... Couldn't hear you.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.898
Oh, that's okay.
People say I always mumble. Um...

10:47.981 --> 10:50.067
No, no, no.
I just have terrible hearing.

10:50.151 --> 10:51.360
That's fine.

10:51.444 --> 10:53.487
- Well, we're both crippled.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.698
Um, you were saying you're a tutor?

10:55.781 --> 10:57.658
A tutor, yes. Yeah.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.370
Uh, on-set teacher
for the show, um, Witchita.

11:01.454 --> 11:04.122
So the kids on the show,
you're like their school?

11:04.207 --> 11:06.917
Uh, yeah, basically.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.044
What about you?
What do you do?

11:09.127 --> 11:12.631
Oh, I work for this company called
Golden Coast Research and Surveys.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.467
We specialize in focus groups.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.219
Oh. Fun.

11:16.302 --> 11:19.513
And you, like...
you moderate the focus groups or...

11:19.597 --> 11:21.390
Oh, I don't really like
to think of it as moderating.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.309
I think it's more like interacting.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.936
So what I do is
I try to get a dialogue going

11:26.019 --> 11:27.187
and then I just listen.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.814
That's what I love about my job.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.609
It's about listening,
and it's about working together,

11:31.692 --> 11:33.444
and creating a consensus,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.821
and then giving that
information to corporations,

11:35.904 --> 11:37.656
so that they can make
better products for consumers.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.493
That's a cool perspective,
'cause I feel like a lot of times,

11:40.576 --> 11:43.036
the way people talk
about focus groups, is, like...

11:43.120 --> 11:44.580
They rag on 'em,
you know, 'cause it's like,

11:44.663 --> 11:47.708
"Oh, they dumb things down,"
or "They water things down," or...

11:48.667 --> 11:50.127
That came out rude.
I didn't mean it.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.838
No, I understand.
I mean, I disagree, but, um...

11:52.921 --> 11:55.299
I disagree, too. I don't feel that way.
It's just, like, other--

11:55.383 --> 11:57.968
You know what?
I'm gonna have a quick look at the menu

11:58.051 --> 12:00.220
'cause I really wanna decide
what I'm gonna order,

12:00.304 --> 12:02.681
and it's hard for me
to concentrate if we--

12:02.765 --> 12:04.099
-We keep talking. Yeah, no.
-Yeah.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.352
I know. I always think about that,
like, at a restaurant.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.478
I'm always like,

12:07.561 --> 12:11.189
"Hey, when do we just stop talking,
and focus on the... the menu?"

12:11.274 --> 12:13.817
- So, um. Yeah.
- The shower head started to leak.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.612
Bam! The shower head blast off!

12:16.695 --> 12:18.656
- It did?
- Yeah.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.783
And I'm sorry, but, uh,
a shower head

12:20.866 --> 12:22.576
is the last thing I want coming at me
when I'm naked.

12:22.660 --> 12:25.037
--No doubt!

12:25.120 --> 12:27.665
- Boom! Ahh!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.669
All right, here we are.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.630
Red wine for you, sir,
and a sea breeze for the lady.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.256
Oh, thank you,
but actually, it's...

12:36.340 --> 12:38.050
-Yeah.
-What happened? Oh! Oh, man--

12:38.133 --> 12:39.343
Oh, no,
how did I mess that up?

12:39.427 --> 12:41.512
-No, it's okay.
-Oh, I feel terrible.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.597
You know what?
Those drinks are on the house.

12:43.681 --> 12:44.932
-Oh, seriously?
-Yeah.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.142
From me to you, on the house,
just because.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.813
-That's nice. Thank you.
-Wow. That is very generous. Thank you.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.940
-And I think we might be ready to order.
-Sounds great.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.275
Give me just one moment.
I'll be right back.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.527
-Oh.
-Okay.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.323
Nice. Free drinks.

13:00.406 --> 13:03.617
Yeah, it's a bit of a move,
though, on his end.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.661
You know, waiters do that.
They give you free drinks,

13:05.744 --> 13:08.956
so you give 'em a bigger tip
and order more food.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.958
I mean, he doesn't lose anything
by giving us free drinks.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.418
It's all gain for him.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.504
It's cool. I'm just saying
he's not that nice of a guy.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.466
You wanna toast?

13:18.549 --> 13:20.008
-Yeah? Let's toast.
-Sure.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.302
-To what?
-Uh, well,

13:22.386 --> 13:23.596
Frank Sinatra used to say,

13:23.679 --> 13:25.848
"May you all live
to be 100 years old.

13:25.931 --> 13:31.019
And me, 100 years old minus one day
so I don't have to see you die."

13:31.103 --> 13:32.396
Huh. Did he really say that?

13:32.480 --> 13:33.522
I think so.

13:33.606 --> 13:35.232
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.487
You know what?
I don't care what Yelp says.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.779
I'm liking this place.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.198
Yeah, me, too.
It's not so bad.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.283
Mickey said you can't trust that anyway.

13:45.368 --> 13:47.495
Like, usually it's just, like,
one angry guy who has,

13:47.578 --> 13:50.122
like, a bunch of different accounts,
who writes a bunch of bad reviews.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.666
She did that
to a Thai place once.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.543
She told me she did it
with the dry cleaners.

13:54.627 --> 13:57.421
Oh, she did both.
Mickey's a badass. I love her.

13:57.505 --> 14:00.173
Aw. Such a badass.
Yeah, she's awesome.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.384
She keeps me cool.

14:01.467 --> 14:02.510
-Yeah.
-Both of us.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.302
I think maybe that's why she set us up.

14:04.387 --> 14:07.180
Oh, yeah.
Like... like, what do you mean?

14:08.098 --> 14:10.350
Oh, you know, just, like,
she's a lot cooler than me

14:10.434 --> 14:13.396
and you're, like,
a really nice guy, but...

14:13.479 --> 14:14.605
-Right.
-Uh, never mind.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.189
-I don't think I said that right.
-Oh.

14:16.273 --> 14:20.152
Yeah, like, Mickey just hangs out
with the cool kids.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.362
Like, I'm not a cool kid.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.030
Oh, I wouldn't put it that way.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.240
What? I mean, come on.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.493
Yeah. Yeah.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.996
No, it's cool. I just...
I didn't know she was such a puppeteer.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.040
-I don't think that's what's... No.
-Okay.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.458
Okay. No, it's cool.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.126
I didn't...

14:36.209 --> 14:37.586
It's fine. Um...

14:38.962 --> 14:40.714
-Ugh.
-You're still cold?

14:40.798 --> 14:42.257
I've adjusted to it.
I like it.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.260
Don't suffer
just so other people are comfortable.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.054
I used to be that person.
You know, I used to be

14:47.137 --> 14:49.890
somebody who was, like,
afraid to ask for things because

14:49.973 --> 14:52.017
- out of fear or whatever. Just tell me.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.769
If you're uncomfortable,
just say you're uncomfortable.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.104
-It's fine.
-Sue me, I don't like shrimp!

14:56.188 --> 14:57.565
I love shrimp!

14:57.648 --> 15:01.068
Are you kidding? They're horrible!
They're all veiny. They look like insects!

15:01.151 --> 15:03.195
Hey, let me ask you this.
Hey, buddy, let me ask you this.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.989
Uh, between a horse and...

15:06.073 --> 15:08.534
and a ferret and, um, a shrimp,

15:08.617 --> 15:10.035
which one looks more like an insect?

15:10.118 --> 15:13.246
Hey, glasses! Come on.
Shrimp, thumbs up, thumbs down?

15:13.330 --> 15:14.957
-Which?
-I don't know.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.417
- Thumbs up?
- Wrong!

15:16.500 --> 15:18.168
Why don't we just switch tables?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.421
'Cause they're being loud,
and I can tell they're annoying you,

15:20.504 --> 15:21.964
-and you're cold...
-Oh, really...

15:22.047 --> 15:24.049
...and I think it'd just be better
if we-- Just let me ask.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.968
-Okay.
-Let's just see if it's possible, okay?

15:26.051 --> 15:27.052
Sure.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.055
Excuse me?
Hi, um, could I...

15:30.138 --> 15:32.057
Okay. So...

15:32.766 --> 15:33.976
Excuse me?

15:34.059 --> 15:37.688
Who am I, fucking Invisible Man?

15:37.771 --> 15:38.981
Oh, no.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.484
Nothing more emasculating than,
like, not being noticed.

15:41.567 --> 15:44.027
I might as well just take this knife,
you know,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.320
just come in here and cut my dick off.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.741
-Oh, God.
-Um... excuse me.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.577
Our waiter's not seeing me.
I'm just gonna talk to him.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.454
-I really don't need to--
-No, no, no. It's cool.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.248
-It's gonna be fine. It's good, it's good.
-Okay.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.834
Uh, excuse me?

15:58.917 --> 15:59.960
I'm sorry.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.253
Excuse me?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.338
Excuse me?

16:04.507 --> 16:06.258
- Can we switch tables?
- What's the problem?

16:12.598 --> 16:15.225
I am so sorry about the air conditioner.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.686
Let's get you somewhere else
before you freeze, huh?

16:17.770 --> 16:19.021
-Uh, sure. Thanks.
-Okay.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.398
Cool. Yeah, she's just
not having a good time, so...

16:21.482 --> 16:22.941
No problem.
No, it happens all the time.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.568
-And I guess--
-No, you don't have to bring--

16:24.652 --> 16:25.819
-You sure?
-You can bring it if you want.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.029
Someone else will get that.
That's okay.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.740
-Okay. I'll put that there.
-All right.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.867
-And, uh, the drinks, too, or should--
-Nope.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.744
-Oh. Okay, cool.
-Yeah.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.170
Ow! Fuck!

16:51.554 --> 16:54.515
Hey, it's Dianne.
Leave a message.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.225
Hey, Dianne.
It's Mickey from AA.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.395
I'm picking up the phone
instead of picking up a drink.

17:00.478 --> 17:04.149
Currently arranging my books by color,
so looking for something to do.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.944
If you could give me a call,
I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

17:09.697 --> 17:12.991
So that'll be two steaks.
One medium-well, one rare.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.785
And I'll get those appetizers
out to you right away.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.328
-Thank you.
-Aw, great. Thank you.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.997
And thank you so much for letting us
switch tables. Appreciate it.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.457
Of course.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.961
I hope I wasn't too much
of a dick to that guy.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.880
Did I seem like a dick,
with the switching tables and everything?

17:26.964 --> 17:30.508
I'm just having a hard time
getting a read on him, right?

17:30.593 --> 17:31.677
Yeah? Don't you think?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.637
He seems fine.

17:33.721 --> 17:35.889
I just don't want him to be, like,
pissed off at me and then, like,

17:35.973 --> 17:37.766
get revenge on me
with the food, or whatever.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.018
How? By poisoning you?

17:40.102 --> 17:42.938
No, just, like, by...
I don't know, messing with my food.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.858
You know, like, not washing
his hands and touching it.

17:45.941 --> 17:49.612
Or, like, rubbing a booger on my steak,
or putting a booger in my drink.

17:49.695 --> 17:50.904
Oh, I can't hear that.
I'll be sick.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.447
I'm sorry.
That's not me.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.742
I'm not like the gross guy.

17:55.743 --> 17:58.871
I was just trying to make you laugh or...

17:58.954 --> 18:01.414
Is this weird?
Should we have moved?

18:01.498 --> 18:03.458
I feel like we fucked up,
and we shouldn't have moved.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.378
'Cause now we're next to the,
like, this hostess stand here

18:06.461 --> 18:10.716
and that waiter station where people
keep coming by and being noisy.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.136
Smells like bleach, right?
Do you smell bleach?

18:14.219 --> 18:16.013
Maybe we should ask
if we can get our old table back.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.890
Okay, yeah, let's do that.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.600
I'm kidding.

18:19.683 --> 18:20.809
Oh.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.185
Okay. Funny.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.398
'Cause, yeah, that would be crazy
if we switched twice. Yeah.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.646
Oh, God.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.690
All right, time for those steaks.

19:07.773 --> 19:09.566
-Thank you.
-Ooh. Thank you.

19:09.650 --> 19:10.693
-Bon appétit!
-Thanks.

19:10.776 --> 19:11.819
Thanks.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.823
-Looks good, huh?
-Mmm.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.617
-It's a little bloody, isn't it?
-Nope.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.623
-Eating, like, tiny mouse bites.
-No, it's good.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.001
If a mouse ate that, he'd say,
"Can I have more?"

19:28.085 --> 19:29.712
This is just how I eat.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.463
'Cause if you don't like it,
you don't have to eat it.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.299
That is, like, really bloody.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.135
The less you talk about the blood, it's...
That's better for me.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.721
I'm just gonna have them take it back.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.513
-No, no, no. No!
-It's really-- It's okay.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.767
-Hey! Come on.
-Hey, whoa! Jesus. Okay.

19:43.851 --> 19:46.186
Don't eat it fast
just so I don't return it.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.274
I'm sorry, please excuse me.
I have to use the restroom.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.485
Okay. Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
Are you choking?

19:53.568 --> 19:56.154
-I'm not choking.
-Okay.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.073
Well... you...

19:58.156 --> 20:00.033
I really don't need you
to take me to the bathroom.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.534
-Okay.
-'Kay.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.751
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.812
Fuck.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.275
And how is everything here?
Are you finished?

20:33.358 --> 20:35.819
Uh... no.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.907
I'm not...
I mean, her steak is a little bloody.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.910
So maybe we can take it back,
make it well done.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.663
You want me
to take it off the bill?

20:46.747 --> 20:49.499
- No. You don't have to do that.
- No? Oh.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.502
-Problem with yours, though?
-No.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.172
No, I'm just a slow eater.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.506
Mmm-hmm.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.593
Hey, um... I think...

21:01.719 --> 21:04.765
I think she sent me a text
that she meant to send to her friend.

21:04.848 --> 21:07.225
Is it bad?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.853
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

21:09.937 --> 21:14.024
I'll tell you what, bro.
I'm gonna take care of this steak for you.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.193
You know what?

21:16.276 --> 21:18.028
-Leave her steak.
-Okay.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.572
It's... it's perfect. It's...

21:20.655 --> 21:22.825
it's the perfect level of bloodiness.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.411
Okay.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.794
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.628
Did I miss anything?

21:35.712 --> 21:37.589
Nope. Don't think so.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.428
-It's good.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.680
-Can I have a sip?
-Of my wine?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.558
Yeah. Can I have a little sip?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.685
Uh, sure.

21:55.983 --> 21:58.735
Mmm... Mmm.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.782
- That's good.
- Yeah, it is.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.994
-Can I have another sip?
-Yep, go... Yeah.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.248
Ugh...

22:11.331 --> 22:13.000
You ever get that thing
where you don't wipe very well

22:13.083 --> 22:14.251
and your asshole's all itchy?

22:16.253 --> 22:19.089
I don't know that I have had that.

22:19.172 --> 22:22.009
I know that's not the most appropriate
table talk, it's just...

22:22.092 --> 22:23.927
-Yeah, it's a little gross.
-It's what's on my mind,

22:24.011 --> 22:26.638
so I'm just kind of, like,
dealin' with it right now.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.891
If I, like, kind of move it
across the seat,

22:28.974 --> 22:30.267
I get the scratch.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.686
I'm just trying to get that
butthole scratch, you know?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.190
Fuck. I forgot to text my buddy.

22:37.274 --> 22:38.691
It's his birthday today.
Do you mind?

22:38.775 --> 22:40.818
Oh, no, that's fine.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.988
Text this motherfucker.
That fuck.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.077
That son of a bitch.

22:49.161 --> 22:50.745
He's a maniac.
He's a madman.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.250
We used to hang out a lot in college.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.210
Happy birthday.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.882
You son of a bitch.

23:14.186 --> 23:16.396
Oh, my God.
Poor Bertie.

23:45.300 --> 23:49.512
Yeah, I mean, if Boston didn't just have,
like, the coldest winter ever last year,

23:49.596 --> 23:51.306
then maybe I'd agree with you

23:51.389 --> 23:54.517
that there's such a thing as,
uh, "global warming."

23:54.601 --> 23:55.685
There is scientific research

23:55.768 --> 23:57.980
that says that climate change
is definitely happening.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.189
Climate change?

23:59.272 --> 24:01.233
Climate change is like Valentine's Day.

24:01.316 --> 24:04.319
It's just some fake thing
a corporation made up, you know,

24:04.402 --> 24:05.820
in order to make money.

24:05.903 --> 24:09.532
It's like Santa Claus.
You know who invented Santa Claus, right?

24:09.616 --> 24:10.908
Coca-Cola Company.

24:10.993 --> 24:12.702
- And are we all finished here?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.871
Uh, you know what?
No, I'm still picking on it.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.915
It's just so good.
I, like, wanna savor every ounce of it.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.667
It's, like, the best steak I've ever had.

24:19.751 --> 24:21.253
Okay.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.629
Miss?

24:22.712 --> 24:24.672
Oh, I'm done.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.092
Thank you.
That was fantastic.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.886
All I'm saying is,

24:29.969 --> 24:33.390
if global warming's real,
then I'll sign a petition to end it.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.643
But until then, I'm just gonna assume it's
another myth the government's telling us.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.937
-Like 9/11.
-Hmm? What?

24:40.022 --> 24:44.526
Yeah. No. Totally.
Yeah, like 9/11.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.611
-You're... you're a truther, too?
-Oh, yeah.

24:46.694 --> 24:50.573
I mean, any intelligent person can see
the government was in on it.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.075
Why? Oil.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.868
-It was all about oil.
-Mmm.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.953
The government helped the terrorists.

24:56.038 --> 24:58.665
If you can even consider
what they did terrorism.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.833
-Yeah.
-I mean, what is terrorism?

25:00.917 --> 25:03.420
It's just some people
who believe in something,

25:03.503 --> 25:04.712
and they're willing to fight for it.

25:04.796 --> 25:07.840
I mean, terrorism is just, like,
when you can't afford a battleship.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.634
Yeah! And you know
how everyone's always like,

25:09.717 --> 25:12.512
"Oh, I don't support the war,
but I support the troops?"

25:12.595 --> 25:15.140
Fuck that.
I don't support the troops.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.517
-Wow. Okay.
-Do you not agree?

25:17.600 --> 25:21.604
- No, I agree. Totally. Totally.
- Yeah.

25:23.606 --> 25:24.857
I hate soldiers.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.902
But you know what I do like
about soldiers? The guns.

25:32.824 --> 25:33.991
--Oh.

25:48.423 --> 25:52.927
When I'm on Tinder, I'm like,
"Black, nope. Hispanic, nope.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.472
-Asian, nope."
-Ow!

25:55.555 --> 25:58.225
- What's wrong?
- I think my dick fell asleep.

25:58.308 --> 26:01.811
I don't know if I, like, sat on it weird,
or, like, pinched an artery,

26:01.894 --> 26:04.564
but, like...
my big dick fell asleep.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.524
Oh, no. It fell asleep?
Ouch.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.775
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

26:07.859 --> 26:11.696
I was thinking, maybe after
we get out of here...

26:11.779 --> 26:13.281
...we go hit up a strip club.

26:13.365 --> 26:14.741
Great. That sounds like so much fun.

26:14.824 --> 26:17.285
Maybe we can wake up
that numb dick of yours.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.703
Perfect.
Hey, let's get out of here.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.413
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

26:22.499 --> 26:23.625
Hmm.

26:25.668 --> 26:26.919
Oh, you're choking?

26:27.003 --> 26:29.256
Oh, no!
I guess we can't go to the strip club.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.258
That is too bad.

26:33.385 --> 26:34.969
All right, let's wrap this up.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.972
Mickey was texting both of us.
We all know.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.892
Look, I know you got my text, okay?

26:40.975 --> 26:43.019
What do you want me to say?
It was embarrassing,

26:43.102 --> 26:44.687
for you and for me.

26:44.771 --> 26:48.150
I'm really sorry. It was terrible,
but I didn't know what to say.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.777
It was all
just a little bit much,

26:50.860 --> 26:53.405
with the moving from the tables,
here and there.

26:54.739 --> 26:56.533
Stop it.
I said I'm sorry, okay?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.163
Oh, my God, are you really choking?
Is this real?

27:01.246 --> 27:03.165
Oh, my God.
He's choking! Fuck!

27:03.248 --> 27:05.041
I got you! I got you, buddy.
Here we go.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.168
- There it is.

27:06.251 --> 27:07.627
Okay, there we go, buddy.
Come on! Come on!

27:07.710 --> 27:08.753
It's not working.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.255
It's not working?
Why is it not working?

27:10.338 --> 27:13.132
- There it is.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.143
I'm okay.

27:25.187 --> 27:27.772
I'm sorry, my bad.
I'll clean it up.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.026
It's okay.

27:32.109 --> 27:34.028
Seriously, sorry again.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.072
Well, it's okay.
I started it.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.742
-Did you text Mickey yet?
-No. You?

27:42.870 --> 27:45.248
Don't tell her what happened.
She'll enjoy it too much.

27:45.332 --> 27:46.499
Okay.

27:52.630 --> 27:56.551
-Mickey?
-Hey, Syd! How are ya?

27:56.634 --> 27:58.928
I just put my kid to bed.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.431
-Uh, you want a cigarette?
-Please, God, yes.

28:02.807 --> 28:06.644
Oh, my God. If I have to read my kid
The Giving Tree one more time,

28:06.728 --> 28:08.020
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.981
God, I can't even imagine.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.942
I don't even know why he likes it.
It's not fun. It's depressing.

28:13.025 --> 28:17.280
It's like the tree is
some kind of codependent,

28:17.364 --> 28:19.073
who loves being a martyr.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.075
It's like, "Tree, we know
you went to Catholic school.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.411
- Just get in therapy."

28:24.746 --> 28:26.873
I was about to pour myself
a glass of wine. You want one?

28:26.956 --> 28:29.125
Yeah. No.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.753
No. Uh...

28:33.170 --> 28:35.757
Today is my first day sober, again.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.759
Really? Wow.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.512
Yeah.

28:40.595 --> 28:43.390
I was sober for about
18 months there,

28:43.473 --> 28:45.767
but I was kind of lying towards the end.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.519
Mostly lying to AA people.

28:48.311 --> 28:49.646
I was in AA for a while.

28:49.729 --> 28:52.690
-You were?
-Yeah, for three years.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.651
It wasn't really for me, though.

28:54.734 --> 28:58.571
I mean, it got me through a rough patch,
but I'm better now, so...

29:01.491 --> 29:02.909
Yeah, well...

29:05.161 --> 29:07.414
Today was a rough day.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.543
You know how they say,
"When you feel like picking up a drink,

29:11.626 --> 29:14.170
pick up a phone instead"?
Well...

29:14.254 --> 29:15.755
that didn't really work for me, either.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.549
Yeah, I remember folks saying that.

29:17.632 --> 29:20.968
I don't know, I was always like,
"If I feel like picking up a drink,

29:21.052 --> 29:22.929
I'm gonna pick up a drink."

29:23.012 --> 29:25.265
- Or a guy.
- Yeah.

29:25.348 --> 29:27.684
I did a lot of that before I met Jeff.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.520
God, he would kill me
if he caught me smoking this.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.021
He made me promise him I'd quit.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.940
That is so sweet.

29:35.024 --> 29:37.193
-Or annoying.
-No, that's nice.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.946
That's like,
he wants you around.

29:40.029 --> 29:43.283
I've never had a guy care enough
about me to want me to quit smoking.

29:44.784 --> 29:48.413
I had a guy try and get me
to do heroin once.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.332
- Does that count?

29:50.415 --> 29:53.000
I once dated a guy who used to
make me clean out his litter box

29:53.084 --> 29:54.294
before we could have sex.

29:55.378 --> 29:57.213
Wait. He shit in a litter box?

29:57.297 --> 29:59.090
-No, the cat. He had a cat.
-Oh.

29:59.173 --> 30:02.760
I didn't meet Jeff until I decided
I deserved someone who was nice to me.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.808
Thanks for the ciggy.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.518
I'm sorry I wasn't more supportive.

30:10.602 --> 30:13.730
I was basically like,
"AA doesn't work."

30:13.813 --> 30:15.940
-But that was just for me, so...
-Yeah.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.360
-Hang in there.
-You, too.

30:21.112 --> 30:23.865
If my kid's still awake when
I go up there, I'm coming back down.

30:24.616 --> 30:28.453
-Mmm, so good.
-Mmm, the best. It's so good.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.330
And it feels so good on my throat, too.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.540
Oh, my God. That was so crazy,
when you were choking.

30:32.624 --> 30:35.251
I was, like,
"Wow, he's really choking."

30:35.335 --> 30:36.878
So ridiculous.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.505
That happens to me,
like, all the time.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.548
Really? You'd be terrible at blowjobs.

30:41.341 --> 30:44.511
-You think?
-Yeah. A very big health hazard for you.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.513
Well, I'll make sure never to suck a dick.

30:46.596 --> 30:48.848
It's a good idea.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.933
Hey, don't tell Mickey
that I puked, by the way.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.769
You can tell her.

30:52.852 --> 30:56.230
So why do you think she, like,
pawned us off on each other, huh?

30:57.189 --> 30:58.650
You think she thinks, like,
we're real freaks?

30:58.733 --> 31:01.403
I think she just thinks
we're both nice people.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.320
Well, maybe I'm not nice,
you know?

31:04.113 --> 31:07.784
Like, sometimes, like,
if a waiter's, like, really bad,

31:07.867 --> 31:11.162
I'll just, like,
tip them, like, 30%...

31:12.414 --> 31:14.916
...so they go, like,
"I didn't deserve this."

31:14.999 --> 31:16.208
You're a scumbag.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.252
-Piece of shit. That's what I am.
-Yeah.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.923
-You're a... you're a terrible guy.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.758
Well, I just think we're two nice people

31:23.841 --> 31:27.011
who gave it our best shot
and that's the best we can do.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.888
Anyway, I'm into chubby guys.

31:31.683 --> 31:33.601
I just gotta use the bathroom,
and I'll get out of your hair.

31:33.685 --> 31:36.646
-Oh, sure. It's just down the hall.
-Okay. Thank you. Sorry.

31:39.441 --> 31:40.608
Oh.

31:43.152 --> 31:44.487
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:44.571 --> 31:48.658
Hi. I rearranged the furniture,
obviously, but I can put it back.

31:48.741 --> 31:49.951
No. It's cool. I like it.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.579
So how was the date?

31:52.662 --> 31:54.831
You guys stopped texting me.
I felt so left out.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.875
I'm... I'm sorry,
though, if I butted in.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.086
-Did I take it too far?
-No, no.

32:00.169 --> 32:03.423
It's all good. We're cool.
Me and Gus just want to be friends.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.050
Cool.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.384
Uh, is he here?

32:07.469 --> 32:10.012
Yeah, he's just in the bathroom,
then he's gonna go.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.723
Cool.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.100
So, what was the restaurant like?

32:14.183 --> 32:17.228
Were the Yelp reviews right?
Did the calamari taste frozen?

32:17.311 --> 32:19.689
Oh, I had steak, so I couldn't say.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.023
Hey.

32:23.693 --> 32:25.945
-Room's different.
-Mickey rearranged.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.822
Ah.

32:27.905 --> 32:30.783
Oh, my God.
I have that, like, same rug.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.869
Except mine's in blue, not orange.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.161
I wanted orange, but...

32:34.245 --> 32:35.455
It's Mickey's rug.

32:35.538 --> 32:36.873
Ah.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.502
Got the same rug. Cool.

32:40.585 --> 32:43.337
Okay, well, thank you
for the good time tonight.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.465
-Yes. It was fun.
-That was really fun.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.884
-Yeah, take care.
-All right. You, too.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.052
Hey, dude, those text messages
were so funny.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.388
-Oh, you like that?
-I was laughing all night.

32:52.472 --> 32:54.724
Oh. Good, good, good.
You know...

32:54.807 --> 32:56.100
I tried.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.438
-Are you pissed at me?
-Okay...

33:02.732 --> 33:04.108
Mickey, you know I like you.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.110
I don't have a lot of dignity...

33:06.944 --> 33:09.363
but I have enough dignity to say, like,

33:09.446 --> 33:12.158
hey, I don't like being
pawned off on another girl.

33:12.241 --> 33:16.538
I'm not just, like,
some nice guy

33:16.621 --> 33:19.248
who's always gonna be around
for you to, like, fuck with.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.668
What do you want me to say?

33:21.751 --> 33:23.210
I don't know.

33:24.295 --> 33:27.131
I'm not dumb.
I know what this is.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.716
I get it.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.927
You're not interested.
It's cool.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.469
We can just say it's cool.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.682
Pleasure to meet ya.

33:35.765 --> 33:36.766
Okay.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.791
- Stop!

34:01.874 --> 34:04.794
Hey! Hello, that was,
like, super dangerous!

34:13.928 --> 34:15.387
Fun first date, huh?

34:20.810 --> 34:22.770
What the fuck was that?
