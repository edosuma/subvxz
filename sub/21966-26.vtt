00:00.875 --> 00:03.834
( horns honking )

00:03.875 --> 00:06.000
Please be patient, citizens.

00:06.041 --> 00:09.542
You must take turns

00:06.041 --> 00:09.542
to make turns.

00:11.166 --> 00:13.458
Is the mayor handing out money

00:11.166 --> 00:13.458
or something?

00:13.500 --> 00:15.500
Something people

00:13.500 --> 00:15.500
like even better.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.250
The chance to be famous.

00:17.291 --> 00:19.000
That, and a recording contract.

00:19.041 --> 00:21.667
Today's the auditions

00:19.041 --> 00:21.667
for Griffin Rock Idol.

00:21.709 --> 00:24.125
And all these people are waiting

00:21.709 --> 00:24.125
in line to sing.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.500
Psh. Real idols don't sing.

00:26.542 --> 00:28.709
Well, I don't. It's silly.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.583
Rescue work is no place

00:28.750 --> 00:30.583
for singing.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.250
What we do is serious.

00:32.291 --> 00:33.625
I like singing.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.291
I want to audition.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.291
Blades.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.709
I thought performing in front

00:36.333 --> 00:38.709
of people made you nervous?

00:38.750 --> 00:41.500
That's true.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.500
Okay, scratch the audition.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.542
I'll take the famous part,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.542
though.

00:43.583 --> 00:44.875
( horn honks )

00:47.083 --> 00:48.750
Hey, Frankie!

00:47.083 --> 00:48.750
Here to try out?

00:48.792 --> 00:50.583
Later on,

00:48.792 --> 00:50.583
when the line goes down.

00:50.625 --> 00:53.542
Daddy and I came to test a new

00:50.625 --> 00:53.542
invention in the auditorium.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.834
We're just going to

00:53.583 --> 00:55.834
sneak around the back.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.959
Bye for now!

00:58.000 --> 01:01.083
This is Huxley Prescott

00:58.000 --> 01:01.083
giving you an "eyeful"

01:01.125 --> 01:03.667

01:01.125 --> 01:03.667

01:03.709 --> 01:05.125
MAN:

01:03.709 --> 01:05.125
Ah, here he comes.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.875
Uh-- Is that the mayor?

01:06.917 --> 01:10.166
I just need to move a little

01:06.917 --> 01:10.166
so I can-- Whoa-- Whoa! Ah!

01:10.208 --> 01:11.917
( gasps )

01:11.959 --> 01:13.667
MAN:

01:11.959 --> 01:13.667
It's moving!

01:13.709 --> 01:16.250
Help!

01:17.291 --> 01:19.792
(  upbeat theme playing  )

01:51.500 --> 01:52.959
( screams )

01:53.000 --> 01:56.208
Power up and energize!

01:59.875 --> 02:01.709
( crowd yelps )

02:04.792 --> 02:07.125
( crowd murmurs )

02:07.166 --> 02:10.458
Mayor Luskey, you might want

02:07.166 --> 02:10.458
to postpone the auditions a bit

02:10.500 --> 02:12.250
while we clean up this mess.

02:12.291 --> 02:14.917
But Chief, I-- Hmm.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.500
That would give

02:14.959 --> 02:17.500
the mainland news crew

02:17.542 --> 02:19.208
more time to get here.

02:19.250 --> 02:23.333
Folks, sorry to say,

02:19.250 --> 02:23.333
we're going to have to postpone

02:23.375 --> 02:26.083
the Griffin Rock Idol auditions

02:23.375 --> 02:26.083
for another,

02:26.125 --> 02:28.500
uh, eh--

02:26.125 --> 02:28.500
Let's call it two hours.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.792
( crowd whines )

02:28.542 --> 02:30.792
We waited long enough.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.375
Hey, Doc. Frankie.

02:40.417 --> 02:42.959
Ah, Cody! Glad you're here.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.291
Care to help us

02:43.000 --> 02:45.291
test my new device?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.500
I call it the "Tone-O-Tuner."

02:47.542 --> 02:49.792
When anyone sings

02:47.542 --> 02:49.792
into the microphone,

02:49.834 --> 02:51.333
it keeps them on pitch,

02:51.375 --> 02:53.959
automatically

02:51.375 --> 02:53.959
and instantaneously.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.834
I thought it could be useful

02:54.000 --> 02:56.834
for the auditions.

02:56.875 --> 02:59.542
But isn't it kind of

02:56.875 --> 02:59.542
like cheating?

02:59.583 --> 03:01.875
If everybody in the competition

02:59.583 --> 03:01.875
used a machine

03:01.917 --> 03:04.417
to help them sing better, how do

03:01.917 --> 03:04.417
you know who's really good

03:04.458 --> 03:06.417
and who isn't?

03:04.458 --> 03:06.417
FRANKIE: See Daddy?

03:06.458 --> 03:07.875
That's what I told him.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.583
If I'm going to be

03:07.917 --> 03:09.583
Griffin Rock Idol,

03:09.625 --> 03:11.834
I want to earn it

03:09.625 --> 03:11.834
with my own voice.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.583
One hundred percent me.

03:13.625 --> 03:18.792
Well, I'm sure I'll find a good

03:13.625 --> 03:18.792
use for this eventually.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.959
Pretty sure I will too.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.667
Like winning

03:23.000 --> 03:26.667
a recording contract.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.166
Like Mother

03:35.458 --> 03:37.166
always says...

03:37.208 --> 03:40.083
It's not cheating if you win.

Oh, and now the mayor will only

04:12.375 --> 04:17.291
talk to the Mainland News crew.

04:17.333 --> 04:20.709

to plan

I don't like being in front
