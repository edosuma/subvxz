WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:05.939
Got a little
something for you.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.842
Man, she is a fly.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.844
Not a fly, is fly.
She's fly.

00:10.878 --> 00:13.914
I just wish I knew
what to do to get
a girl like her.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.050
Easy. Be a guy
like him.

00:16.084 --> 00:19.019
CHRIS ROCK:
In high school, you learned
that the type of girl you are

00:19.053 --> 00:21.021
determines the type of guy
you go out with.

00:21.055 --> 00:24.558
Nerdy girls hang out
with nerdy guys.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.728
Smart girls hang out
with smart guys

00:27.761 --> 00:29.563
and dumb girls hang out
with jocks.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.598
Ladies.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.335
And then there are the girls

00:34.368 --> 00:35.669
that didn't hang out
with anybody

00:35.703 --> 00:37.905
and the guys that made fun
of them.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.409
We were those guys,
and she was that girl.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.743
Man, look at that.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.078
She looks like
her family gave

00:44.112 --> 00:46.013
the baby back
and kept the stork.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.781
Her name is Kelly,
but everybody

00:47.815 --> 00:48.982
calls her "Big Bird."

00:49.016 --> 00:50.618
Hey, Big Bird.
Yo, Big Bird.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.052
What's up, Big Bird?

00:54.021 --> 00:55.956
I wonder what'd have
to go wrong for you to end
up with a girl like that.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.326
It's like being
on The Planet of The Apes,

00:58.359 --> 00:59.393
and all the apes
said, "No."

01:01.462 --> 01:04.398
I didn't have anything
against Big Bird,

01:04.432 --> 01:06.367
and unfortunately for me,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.669
she didn't have anything
against me either.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.039
You're Chris, right?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.041
Yeah.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.510
I've seen you around,

01:16.544 --> 01:18.846
and I really think
you're kinda cute.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.615
Do you want to hang out
sometime?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.950
No!

01:22.983 --> 01:24.452
Sure.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.953
Where's an ape
when you need one?

01:39.933 --> 01:43.404
* Aw, make it funky now.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.084
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

02:00.888 --> 02:03.090
While Big Bird was trying
to get with me,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.092
Greg was trying
to get the lowdown.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.094
Dude, did I see you
talking to Big Bird yesterday?

02:07.127 --> 02:10.030
Shh! Yeah, she asked me out.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.599
She's, like,
the goofiest girl

02:11.632 --> 02:13.501
this side of Roseanne
Roseannadanna.
What'd you say?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.969
I told her yeah.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.037
Why?

02:17.070 --> 02:21.074
'Cause she asked.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.743
Girls don't ask
me out all the time.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.078
Yeah, that's the beauty
of the situation.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.080
You had a chance
to boost your low
self-esteem

02:27.114 --> 02:29.082
by turning someone else
down for a change.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.618
Yeah, but when
the girl asks,

02:30.651 --> 02:31.785
you don't just say no.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.921
Plus, my dad said
never to hurt a
girl's feelings.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.756
Besides, they don't
take rejection well.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.991
How are they gonna learn
if they don't get any practice?

02:38.025 --> 02:40.794
Attractive girls don't
take rejection well.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.363
Girls like Big Bird,
they're used to it.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.697
You know what?
Fine. It's done.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.932
I'm gonna go out
with her once.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.934
Trust me. I'm gonna
make sure we don't have fun,

02:46.967 --> 02:47.868
so she doesn't want
to go out again.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.671
I usually did that
without trying.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.407
While I was betting I could get
rid of Big Bird,

02:53.441 --> 02:55.809
Vanessa was betting big
on the Jets.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.810
Here you go.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.379
Sorry it took so long.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.880
Five weeks,
you should be sorry.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.482
You should have
saved your money.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.784
I told you the Jets
were gonna win.

03:03.817 --> 03:07.221
Vanessa, you gonna get enough
of this gambling,

03:07.255 --> 03:08.889
I keep trying to tell you.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.524
No, this is
a sure thing.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.660
The New York Jets
have been on a
winning streak

03:12.693 --> 03:14.562
like you've never seen.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.929
They just got lucky.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.931
I'll bet you they
don't win next week.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.567
The Giants play the Jets?

03:19.600 --> 03:22.002
No, they're just both
on winning streaks.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.906
Wait a minute. This is the
dumbest thing I ever heard.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.642
Your team is winning
and your team is winning,

03:28.676 --> 03:31.579
but you both figured out
a way to lose money on it.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.781
Well, all I know is
the Giants are gonna lose

03:33.814 --> 03:35.316
before the Jets.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.685
I'll tell you what. If the
Giants lose before the Jets,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.753
the barbershop will pay
for you ladies

03:39.787 --> 03:41.021
to have a night out
on the town.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.424
Oh-oh, well,
start saving.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.725
But what if we win?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.628
That, that is not
going to happen.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.631
Since it's not gonna happen,
say anything.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.899
Buy everybody a new car.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.002
Cook dinner for all the men
for a month.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.871
Better yet, go out
with Kill Moves.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.541
All right,
little Miss Naysayer,

04:00.574 --> 04:01.909
I'll do that.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.646
If we lose, I'll go out
with Kill Moves.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.514
Ha!

04:09.016 --> 04:12.420
While Vanessa bet on the Jets,
I had a date with a giant.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.355
Hey, Chris.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.923
Is that what you
had on earlier?

04:15.956 --> 04:19.393
No, I had an accident
and I needed to change.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.329
An accident?
What happened?

04:21.362 --> 04:24.332
Oh, I didn't make it
to the bathroom in time,

04:24.365 --> 04:26.300
so I to get something
from lost-and-found.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.502
Wow, that's crazy.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.003
It looks good
on you, though.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.505
It makes you look edgy.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.542
Even though my bad clothes
didn't seem to work,

04:34.575 --> 04:37.478
there was more bad stuff
to come: bad food.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.612
I never heard
of this place.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.714
Yeah, everything
the serve is from stuff

04:40.748 --> 04:43.417
that other people
didn't finish eating.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.788
After the bad food,
there was a bad movie.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.490
What's this called?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.459
Leonard Part V.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.560
Nipsy Russell's best movie.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.428
They're doing a sequel
with Bill Cosby.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.797
Stop you guys
from committing a crime.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.900
After the bad movie,
we took a bad walk.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.771
Hey, little dude on a date,
let me hold all your money!

05:05.839 --> 05:07.875
Chris, come back!

05:07.908 --> 05:08.942
No!

05:13.146 --> 05:17.385
The only date worse than me
was Phil Spector.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.919
While I was running
for my life,

05:18.952 --> 05:21.054
Vanessa was running
her game down.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.456
Listen up now, everybody.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.024
Now, we all in this together.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.626
So if we gonna win this thing,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.528
then we got
to get our mojo working.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.529
Mojo?

05:29.597 --> 05:31.799
Is that what
we're depending on, mojo?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.537
Well, what about the stats,
the line, the over, the under?

05:36.570 --> 05:41.108
What about the odds?
The spread, the angle,
the handicap?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.976
What about the hook,
the hot game?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.945
You know, the rundown,
the system?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.648
What about a tout,
the trends?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.050
What about a wiseguy?

05:50.083 --> 05:50.984
Everybody needs a wiseguy.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.553
Rochelle,

05:52.586 --> 05:53.987
I'll have you know

05:54.021 --> 05:57.591
I have a very precise system
that's worked for nine months.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.927
Really

06:03.130 --> 06:04.097
Four out of five dentists
think she's crazy.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.669
And I pluck three mole hairs
before every game.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.838
And I been eating two
chicken-fried bananas

06:10.871 --> 06:12.105
before every game.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.507
Just two?

06:13.541 --> 06:15.876
Well, I don't know what you want
me to do.

06:15.909 --> 06:19.947
What do you normally do
during the game?

06:19.980 --> 06:23.751
Well, other than serving beer
and chips, I'm usually ironing.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.753
Did you do that week two
when the Jets lost?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.621
Now, how am I supposed to know
what week is what

06:27.655 --> 06:28.822
in your mojo world?

06:28.856 --> 06:31.124
Think, Rochelle,
this is important.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.693
Remember, I lost all that money

06:32.726 --> 06:34.995
and you gave me that lecture
on "gambling is evil..."

06:35.028 --> 06:37.565
That's when Julius burnt
my shirt.

06:37.598 --> 06:42.903
Giants win 20 to 7,
Jet's lose 20 to 6.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.041
Julius, my shirt!

06:48.075 --> 06:51.044
What do you mean, you lost $30?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.781
And every week after that,
I've been ironing.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.083
And every week the Jets
have been winning,

06:56.116 --> 06:58.051
so I don't care what
you do on Monday.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.754
You make sure you iron
those clothes.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.189
Mm-hmm.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.092
Before ESPN, people had their
own roundtable discussions

07:05.125 --> 07:07.595
by sitting around a table
and discussing.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.697
So the girls at the beauty shop
made a bet

07:09.730 --> 07:11.665
against the guys
at the barber shop.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.234
It's silly, but the guys
are rooting for the Giants

07:14.267 --> 07:16.470
and the girls are rooting
for the Jets.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.038
That is silly. There's no way

07:18.071 --> 07:20.608
the Jets are gonna continue
winning.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.043
Oh, really? What makes you
an expert?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.512
Because he's a man.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.214
I watch football every week.
That's why I'm an expert.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.650
So you saying I'm stupid?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.151
This was not the first time

07:31.184 --> 07:32.953
my parents had this
conversation.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.655
It's too expensive.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.857
So you saying I'm not
a good mother?

07:36.890 --> 07:40.561
I just don't see what's funny
about a Volkswagen Beetle.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.531
So you saying you
never should have
married me?

07:43.564 --> 07:44.732
That's not what I said.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.933
That's what I think.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.668
The Giants are gonna win
the Superbowl,

07:47.701 --> 07:50.270
and Phil Simms is gonna lead
them to the promised land.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.138
Right, Daddy?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.205
That's right,
sweetie.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.507
You're crazy.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.776
Wesley Walker and
Al Toon are having
record years.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.511
The Jets are going
to the Superbowl.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.512
Ain't that right, Mom?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.647
No doubt about it.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.183
Tonya's right.
The Giants are unbeatable.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.018
All right, Julius,
I'll tell you what.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.921
I hate betting, but since
you want to run your mouth,

08:07.955 --> 08:10.924
and call me names,
if the Giants lose

08:10.958 --> 08:14.061
before the Jets do, you and
little Miss That's What I Said

08:14.094 --> 08:15.996
have to clean up
after everybody else

08:16.029 --> 08:16.997
for a month.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.632
And if the Jets lose
before the Giants,

08:18.666 --> 08:20.067
you and Drew have to do it.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.302
You have a bet.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.706
All right. You're gonna lose.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.810
Since we had gotten off
to a bad start,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.179
I was praying for a bad finish.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.215
That was so funny
when you ran away.
You're fast.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.250
You thought that was funny?

08:37.284 --> 08:38.719
You didn't see
what it looked like.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.688
Besides, that guy
didn't scare me.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.922
He didn't?

08:41.955 --> 08:45.092
No, I could see his thumb
sticking out of his gun pocket.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.128
Didn't he take all your money?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.330
No, he didn't. I keep
my money in my bra.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.200
All he got was some eye drops
and some rash cream.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.072
Eye drops and rash cream? Damn!

08:59.106 --> 09:02.710
Little dude owes me a dollar.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.012
After all I did to make things
go wrong,

09:05.045 --> 09:07.214
I never would have bet
that things with Kelly

09:07.247 --> 09:08.616
would be going so right.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.954
Well, that was great.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.322
Yeah, that was cool.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.157
Well, I better
get home.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.693
Yeah, me, too.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.729
Everyone called Kelly
"Big Bird,"

09:21.762 --> 09:25.633
but call me cuckoo; I was
actually starting to like her.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.808
That kiss from Big Bird made me
feel like Superfly.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.414
While I was flying
with Big Bird,

09:41.448 --> 09:43.116
my father wanted
the Jets to crash.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.818
I need the Jets to lose.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.788
We're doing everything we can
to put the mojo on the Jets.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.189
I'm wearing my lucky socks.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.091
I ain't eating nothing
but bananas and peanut butter.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.060
I'm gonna call 'em up
and I'm gonna threaten 'em.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.494
What about you, Julius?

09:54.527 --> 09:57.430
What did you do the last
time the Jets lost?

09:57.464 --> 10:00.868
It was weird 'cause I remember
I was ironing

10:00.901 --> 10:02.135
because the Giants won
20 to 7

10:02.169 --> 10:04.972
and the Jets lost 20 to 6,

10:05.005 --> 10:07.607
and I remember thinking, "That's
one extra point worth of loss."

10:07.641 --> 10:09.109
Well, you know what that means.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.978
You need to iron on Monday.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.612
ALL:
Yeah!

10:12.646 --> 10:14.648
Keeping my relationship
with Big Bird a secret

10:14.682 --> 10:16.516
was easy for the most part.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.051
Turns out,

10:18.085 --> 10:21.689
the person I had the most
trouble hiding it from was her.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.957
I hid it during school.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.794
I hid it before school.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.965
I even kept it hidden
after school.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.969
* Get away from the pain you're
driving to the heart of me *

10:36.003 --> 10:38.271
What are you looking for,
Tender Love?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.843
The Giants had won their fifth
game in a row,

10:42.876 --> 10:45.545
and Tonya was counting on the
Jets' winning streak to end.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.580
You better
pick that up.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.216
I'm not picking
it up.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.818
You got to pick it up.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.485
And then you're gonna
have to clean the rest
of the house.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.856
We'll see about that.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.228
Kelly didn't realize that I was
avoiding being seen with her.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.698
She just thought I was the
greatest phone boyfriend ever.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.667
I guess my favorite rappers
are Run-DMC.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.236
I love Salt n' Pepa.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.804
My favorite character
from the Rocky movies

11:10.838 --> 11:11.805
is Clubber Lang.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.673
I love Captain Drago.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.542
And I jumped off the top stairs,
started flying

11:15.575 --> 11:17.577
and landed on
the Mary Jane Girls.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.948
I had the exact same dream
except I landed on Rick James.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.183
About the only thing
we didn't talk about

11:23.216 --> 11:24.818
is when
we'd get together again.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.254
So when do you want
to do something again?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.521
12th of never?

11:28.555 --> 11:31.191
Um... There's a football
game on today.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.826
Maybe we could watch that.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.995
Oh, my place or yours?

11:35.028 --> 11:38.065
I prefer a secluded town
on the outskirts of nowhere.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.168
Um... I was thinking
somewhere different.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.235
Uh, where?

11:42.269 --> 11:45.939
Let it, let it
be my surprise.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.609
Julius, did you see my...?

11:49.642 --> 11:51.644
Hey, Rochelle.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.246
You ready for the Jets game?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.921
You!

12:00.954 --> 12:03.323
No good, low down...

12:03.356 --> 12:05.258
Those are words
you can't say on TV.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.259
Dirty,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.260
good-for-nothing...

12:07.294 --> 12:09.029
To-to sneak down here and...

12:09.062 --> 12:10.230
What's wrong with you?

12:10.263 --> 12:11.865
I'm just doing
the ironing.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.972
I can't
believe this!

12:20.607 --> 12:23.110
Good thing she wasn't
near the toaster.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.578
...lose to Miami, 45...

12:27.948 --> 12:30.250
While my mother was
going to kill my father,

12:30.283 --> 12:33.286
Nessa was going
on a date with Kill Moves.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.791
I liked seeing Kelly,
but I made sure to do it

12:37.825 --> 12:39.793
where no one
I knew would see us.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.261
That was a
great game.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.263
What made you think of coming
to the Port Authority?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.798
Just thought it'd
be different.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.766
This is cool.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.268
You want to watch
something else?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.037
Sure.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.272
Meanwhile, my mother
had a giant problem

12:52.305 --> 12:53.807
with the Jets losing.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.810
Start cleaning, Drew.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.045
You sit back
down, Drew.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.947
You're not cleaning up anything.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.148
What are you
talking about?

13:01.181 --> 13:03.050
I'm not talking to you.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.986
You wanna play
dirty, stay dirty.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.322
My father won a bet, but he
was about to lose a war.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.026
:
We won!

13:13.060 --> 13:17.764
Back at school, the early bird
was about to get the worm.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.765
Surprise!

13:18.798 --> 13:19.900
I found you.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.101
Kelly.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.769
Yeah, you did find me.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.705
Um...

13:25.738 --> 13:27.040
What are you doing here?

13:27.074 --> 13:28.976
I wanted to see you.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.411
It's like I never see you
around school anymore.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.713
It's like I have
to hunt you down.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.783
I'm almost starting to think
that you're trying to avoid me.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.251
Oh. What gave you that idea?

13:38.285 --> 13:39.252
You.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.188
I'm just kidding.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.324
Well, you know, I'm
kind of busy, so...

13:44.357 --> 13:45.192
catch you later.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.393
Okay.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.761
I get it. No girls
in the locker room, right?

13:48.795 --> 13:49.963
Yeah.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.064
Well, I just wanted

13:51.098 --> 13:53.000
to give you something
before I go.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.202
What's that?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.307
Hey!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.409
It's Big Bird.
Hey, were's Bert
and Ernie?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.277
I guess that makes you
Snuffleupagus?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.880
No, it makes him
Roosevelt Franklin.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.149
Cookie?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.951
Cookie!
Cookie!

14:12.319 --> 14:14.187
Who are they making fun of?

14:14.221 --> 14:16.689
They obviously watch
a lot of Sesame Street.

14:16.723 --> 14:20.293
Chris, aren't you
gonna say something?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.162
Or are you just gonna
stand there and watch?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.797
Stand here and watch.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.036
Fine.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.404
Now I know how you really feel.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.044
What's up?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.311
Where you going?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.412
Don't fall over.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.389
While I was trying
to figure out

14:49.422 --> 14:51.391
how to deal with Big Bird,

14:51.424 --> 14:54.761
Vanessa was getting prepared
to deal with Kill Moves.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.197
Good evening, ladies.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.001
Kill Moves? Where'd
you get the car?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.802
I don't know.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.472
It belongs to his mother,
Mrs. Devereaux.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.473
Wow.

15:06.506 --> 15:10.410
You learn something new
every day.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.878
Where's Vanessa?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.113
Uh, this is me.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.149
Where's that woman
you was just with?

15:16.183 --> 15:17.750
Um...
Just explain

15:17.784 --> 15:19.086
when you get in the car.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.353
Go, go, go.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.255
Have a good time.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.357
I think.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.359
While Vanessa took care
of her end of the bet,

15:26.393 --> 15:28.895
at home, all bets were off.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.430
Dinner is served.

15:30.463 --> 15:34.401
Rochelle,
this has gotta stop.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.442
It never would have started
if you never cheated.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.311
Cheated? I never cheated.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.379
Oh, really? So out of the blue,
you just decided

15:46.413 --> 15:48.015
that you wanted to iron?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.282
Well, no.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.351
You no-good, low-down,
dirty little...

15:51.384 --> 15:52.452
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.521
What does me ironing have
to do with me cheating?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.789
Because I always do the ironing

15:56.823 --> 15:58.925
and every time I iron,
the Jets win.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.261
but no, you had to go
steal my mojo

16:01.294 --> 16:03.230
and ruin our nine-game
winning streak.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.464
What?!

16:04.497 --> 16:06.399
I didn't know ironing
was your thing, too.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.136
The guys told me to iron
again, and I just did it.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.206
Really?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.475
Yeah. I play fair.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.810
Oh.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.147
A'ight. Me and Drew
will clean upstairs,

16:20.180 --> 16:23.050
and you and Tonya
will clean downstairs.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.985
Don't touch me.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.826
My father made things
right with my mother.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.429
Now I needed to make
things right with my Bird.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.299
Hey, Dad, I need
to talk to you.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.500
What's up?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.435
Well, there's this girl.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.503
And she likes me.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.837
That's good.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.039
And I really like her.

16:46.073 --> 16:46.939
That's better.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.308
The only thing is,

16:48.341 --> 16:49.876
she's a little
awkward-looking.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.044
Awkward?

16:51.078 --> 16:53.046
Like she has one leg
longer than the other?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.047
No.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.149
Like she dislocated her shoulder

16:56.183 --> 16:57.317
and they put it back wrong?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.418
No.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.387
Like her eyes are
too far apart?

17:00.420 --> 17:01.488
No.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.390
Like she's knock-kneed
and pigeon-toed,

17:03.423 --> 17:05.258
and when she walks she
makes a clicking sound?

17:05.292 --> 17:06.859
No.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.328
It's just that these
football players

17:08.361 --> 17:10.330
were calling her Big Bird
and stuff and...

17:10.363 --> 17:12.232
I didn't really do
anything about it.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.502
Chris, even if a girl's
eyes are too far apart,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.037
I thought I told you never
to hurt a girl's feelings.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.372
I know.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.342
No, obviously you don't.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.277
You think she'll forgive me?

17:24.311 --> 17:26.979
I don't know. You'll have to
work that out with her.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.982
Even if a girl's eyes are
too far apart.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.388
I realized my mistake,

17:35.422 --> 17:38.291
and Vanessa realized
that going out with Kill Moves

17:38.325 --> 17:41.894
wasn't a mistake at all.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.663
You were out
all night?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.499
Oh, girl, that's
just the start of it.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.902
We opened the champagne,
headed for the seaport.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.939
There was a pink helicopter
waiting for me.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.375
You can hear about the rest
of Vanessa's date

17:55.408 --> 18:00.647
at www.vanessa'sbigdate
withkillmoves.tv

18:00.680 --> 18:03.283
After I gave Big Bird
the cold shoulder,

18:03.316 --> 18:04.651
I thought she flew the coop.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.619
You haven't seen her?
No, dude.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.590
("Head Over Heels"
by Tears for Fears plays)

18:12.625 --> 18:18.565
* I wanted to be
with you alone *

18:18.598 --> 18:22.469
* And talk about the weather

18:22.502 --> 18:27.240
* I'm lost in admiration,
did I need you this much? *

18:27.274 --> 18:29.342
* Oh, you're wasting my time

18:29.376 --> 18:33.012
* You're just, just,
just wasting time *

18:33.045 --> 18:37.116
* Something happens
and I'm head over heels *

18:37.150 --> 18:42.989
* I never find out till
I'm head over heels *

18:43.022 --> 18:47.194
* Something happens
and I'm head over heels *

18:47.227 --> 18:50.263
* Ah, don't take my heart,
don't break my heart *

18:50.297 --> 18:53.700
* Don't, don't,
don't throw it away *

18:55.435 --> 18:57.637
* Throw it away...

19:00.373 --> 19:02.175
* Throw it away...

19:02.209 --> 19:04.477
You look amazing.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.046
I know. I decided I
wasn't going to let you

19:07.079 --> 19:08.348
or anyone else crush me,

19:08.381 --> 19:10.483
so my mom took me to
the mall for a makeover.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.118
GUY:
Big Bird...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.119
is that you?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.021
My name is not Big Bird.

19:15.054 --> 19:17.056
It's Kelly.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.529
I'm sorry about what happened.
It's just...

19:22.562 --> 19:25.198
It's just you were fine
going out with me so long as

19:25.232 --> 19:27.434
nobody knew, because you didn't
want to be Big Bird's boyfriend?

19:27.467 --> 19:28.701
Exactly!

19:28.735 --> 19:30.603
No...

19:30.637 --> 19:33.440
Let me make it up to you.
Let me take you out again.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.476
No. Never. Het. Noya...

19:36.509 --> 19:39.612
Unfortunately for me,
Kelly spoke 15 languages.

...Jo. Cuwa. Momo. Tla.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.015
Was that Cherokee?

19:43.049 --> 19:45.485
Domo arigato,
Mr. Roboto.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.719
What?!

19:46.753 --> 19:48.488
Kelly, I was a jerk.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.423
I know. And as much as I'd like

19:50.457 --> 19:53.493
to come here every day
and make you suffer,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.495
I'm going to Paris
tomorrow.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.496
Paris?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.398
That's right, Paris.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.700
I met a lady at the mall
named Cindy Crawford,

20:00.733 --> 20:03.536
and she said she's going to turn
me into a supermodel.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.573
I'm sorry.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.707
I bet you are.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.542
But imagine how sorry
you're going to be

20:09.576 --> 20:12.279
when I turn around
and walk away.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.747
See you later, Kermit.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.485
