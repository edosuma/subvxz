WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:04.080
Uncle Noel? Yeah? Do you know
what week it is this week?

00:04.080 --> 00:05.840
It's Bread Week - Paul's favourite.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.200
Do you wanna see something amazing?
Yes, please.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.160
I was messing about in Paul's
dressing room last night

00:11.160 --> 00:12.760
and I found this. Check this out.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.240
It's the Hollywood handshake. Wow!

00:19.240 --> 00:22.080
Shall we try it out?
Yes, please, actually.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.960
I'll be Paul. Thank you.
Really like your baps.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.600
Thank you, actually.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.600
It's too powerful! Too powerful.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.440
Hi, guys. You all right?
All right?

00:36.800 --> 00:39.160
You haven't been playing
with my handshake, have you?

00:39.160 --> 00:41.000
No, Mr Hollywood.
What handshake?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.320
Because if you have
you get this...

00:43.320 --> 00:45.040
..right?

00:48.640 --> 00:52.320
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.080
Last time...

00:54.080 --> 00:56.840
..it was biscuit week.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.160
I went to art school for this.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.120
If I rubbed them,
I'd wish for Star Baker.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.480
Dave conjured up
a spectacular showstopper.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.880
That is remarkable.
And his Star Baker wish was granted.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.240
Oh, it's cracked.
Rowan was all at sea.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.600
It's definitely been in a storm,
this pot.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.640
But in the end, it was Mak...
I know, it's not brilliant.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.960
I just think the whole thing's
just a little bit clumsy.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.400
..who had to walk the plank.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.120
I'm gonna miss you.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.960
Now... Whack it.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.960
..the bakers face trial by bread.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.560
It's a shame that
Paul Hollywood's judging it, eh?

01:26.560 --> 01:28.160
A soda bread signature.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.880
Interesting flavours.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.760
A Technicolour Technical.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.120
You're a Smurf, aren't you?

01:33.120 --> 01:34.640
Yes.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.680
And a Showstopper Challenge
where transforming dough...

01:37.680 --> 01:40.960
I'm not very good at plaiting.
..into intricate bread plaques...

01:40.960 --> 01:43.560
Might be ready in time to bake.
I hope so.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.080
..will push the bakers...

01:45.080 --> 01:47.800
Don't drop it, don't drop it,
don't drop it. ..to their limits.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.400
LAUGHTER

01:50.920 --> 01:52.480
It's not funny!

01:53.920 --> 01:55.000
Yuck.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.120
Bread's the one area I've probably
got more experience in,

02:22.120 --> 02:24.440
but am I confident? I don't know.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.760
Bread is something that
I've had to teach myself for this.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.360
I kind of wish I hadn't practised,
to be honest.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.160
I felt more confident before.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.920
I like making bread at home
in my kitchen with music on,

02:35.920 --> 02:39.920
but under the eyes
of Paul Hollywood...bit scary.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.320
You have to laugh about it,
because we all dreading it.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.480
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.200
It's time for
your Signature Challenge.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.080
Today, the judges would like you to
make two beautifully baked

02:53.080 --> 02:54.760
soda bread loaves.

02:54.760 --> 02:58.080
Now, you may flavour your
soda breads any way you like,

02:58.080 --> 03:01.160
but one should be sweet
and one should be savoury.

03:01.160 --> 03:05.560
Also, your loaves should be baked
freeform rather than in a tin.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.720
What do you mean, freeform?
Just floating in the air? Yes.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.680
And the judges would like you
each to make a butter

03:11.680 --> 03:13.280
to go with your breads.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.160
Blimey, they don't want much,
do they?

03:16.160 --> 03:18.640
You have one hours, 45 minute.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.080
On your marks. Get set. Bake.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.600
OK, let's go.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.280
Feeling good and ready to go.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.720
I'm excited about soda breads.
I had a lot of it.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.040
My granny used to make
a soda bread every day.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.240
I hope I do a good job with it.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.240
As opposed to a slow prove
with yeasted breads,

03:34.240 --> 03:36.640
the chemical raising agents
in soda breads

03:36.640 --> 03:38.520
starts work almost immediately.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.840
And bicarb into my mixture.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.280
So they must get their loaves
into the oven as quickly as possible

03:44.280 --> 03:47.040
in order to achieve the rise
the judges are after.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.680
Cream of tartar. I'm not sure
what it's doing in my recipe.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.240
I'm sure it plays a role.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.800
The thing is with this challenge,

03:54.800 --> 03:56.520
it's only an hour
and three quarters.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.160
They haven't got to deal with
yeast but they've gotta deal with

03:59.160 --> 04:00.840
the reaction between
the rising agents

04:00.840 --> 04:03.240
and milk or buttermilk to
create the growth in the loaf.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.440
We've asked our bakers to make
two soda breads,

04:06.440 --> 04:09.280
one sweet and one savoury.
Do you know, I'm expecting

04:09.280 --> 04:11.880
lots of cheese and lots of herbs
and lots of nuts.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.160
It would be really nice

04:13.160 --> 04:16.040
to find somebody using something
really different.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.400
Za'atar is more like
an aromatic spice.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.200
Traditionally we have it
like in pastries, on top of breads

04:21.200 --> 04:23.480
so it's perfect for this.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.240
I think they'll all be nervous

04:25.240 --> 04:27.760
because it's their first time
Bread Week with me,

04:27.760 --> 04:30.760
but I think I've given them
an easy challenge. It's soda bread.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.520
Listen to me, Paul Hollywood,
I want to talk to you about bread.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.200
You go on about bread
and you go on about bread.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.600
No-one under the age of 40
eats bread any more.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.200
OK?

04:45.520 --> 04:47.400
Morning. Hello, morning.
Morning. Hello.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.160
So Mark, tell us about
your soda bread.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.200
My, uh, savoury soda bread
is a sobrasada

04:52.200 --> 04:54.640
and an Irish sheep smoked cheese

04:54.640 --> 04:58.080
and then my sweet soda bread
is a Irish stout and chocolate.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.400
So you're baking for Ireland today?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.920
I am, yes. I have the weight
of a nation on my shoulders.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.360
Are you Irish? I am, yeah.
I'm joking.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.360
Hello, Mark speaking.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.440
Mark loves to travel in his job
as a project manager

05:11.440 --> 05:14.720
for public health research programs
in developing countries.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.480
He's adding Spanish sausage,
honey, and mature Cheddar

05:18.480 --> 05:22.200
to his savoury soda bread, but in
a nod to his Northern Irish roots

05:22.200 --> 05:25.880
will blend the chocolate in his
sweet loaf with a classic stout.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.840
And what's the liquid
you're putting in there?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.200
Some melted butter and honey.
Honey in both.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.640
Interesting. No buttermilk?
And buttermilk sorry, yeah,

05:32.640 --> 05:34.680
of course. I was gonna say.
Of course buttermilk.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.040
This is a tip
going through the competition.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.600
When he says "interesting",
that means you've done it wrong.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.080
Done it wrong? OK, OK.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.400
Along with Mark,
three other bakers are using

05:44.400 --> 05:46.720
a location as their inspiration.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.760
I lived in Chester
for a little while

05:48.760 --> 05:51.600
and I used to love
the Welsh bara brith

05:51.600 --> 05:54.480
so I've based my sweet one
on that bara brith flavour,

05:54.480 --> 05:57.640
which is just like a bread pud,
in a sense.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.360
East Sussex-based Linda loves to
head to Bexhill beach

06:01.360 --> 06:04.520
to fish for mackerel and mullet
which she can throw on the barbie.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.600
Hey!

06:06.600 --> 06:09.800
Chilli, cheese and coriander will
flavour Linda's savoury bread

06:09.800 --> 06:12.440
while her love for
traditional Welsh tea cakes

06:12.440 --> 06:14.760
has inspired her sweet loaf.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.240
Lots of fruit in it. Mm-hmm, nice.
I've soaked my fruit in brandies.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.280
Ooh!

06:20.720 --> 06:23.280
I'm like one of those '80s,
uh, game-show hosts.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.600
Say something else.
Pepped it up a little bit.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
Oo-er!

06:27.880 --> 06:30.440
I could do this all day.
Oo-er!

06:30.440 --> 06:34.360
Rowan's creativity has been sparked
from a little further afield.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.280
This is the salsiccia,
the Italian sausage.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.120
So just get it fried off
in a moment.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.600
Get a quick start.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.600
When he's not baking,
Rowan loves to spend time

06:45.600 --> 06:47.000
in his Worcestershire garden.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.680
That one's rosa mundi. OK.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.280
Uh, which is Latin,
rose of the world.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.720
Rowan's bakes include southern
Italian sausage, fennel and olives

06:55.720 --> 06:58.840
for his savoury loaf,
and northern Italian polenta

06:58.840 --> 07:01.360
with raisins and honey
for his sweet loaf.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.520
It's quite a lot, isn't it?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.480
It is. There's a lot going on.
There's a shock.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.240
I just hope they work
in combination. I think they do so.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.600
When you say polenta
you've got in there.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.520
Yeah. What's the polenta
to the flour mix?

07:12.520 --> 07:17.640
370g of polenta and 130 flour.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.320
So it is quite gritty.
It's a risky one.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.680
Some people don't like the
grittiness - I rather like it.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.000
OK, thank you very much.
Interesting. Good luck, Rowan!

07:25.000 --> 07:26.040
Thanks.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.360
Marc's inspiration
comes from shores closer to home.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.000
So I'm doing a Cornish-themed
soda bread

07:32.000 --> 07:35.440
so I'm using Cornish Kern.
It's based on the Cornish Yarg.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.880
It's quite strong, actually,
but not overpowering

07:37.880 --> 07:40.200
so I thought it might
work well for this.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.720
Get a bit of flour.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.640
Born and raised in Leicester,
adopted Cornishman Marc

07:44.640 --> 07:46.480
loves baking with his daughters.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.800
Great. Fist bumps.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.120
To cope with the pressure
of baking bread in the tent,

07:51.120 --> 07:53.440
Marc is keen to keep things familiar

07:53.440 --> 07:56.480
by including as many Cornish
ingredients as possible.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.280
So I'm doing a Cornish kelp,
Cornish cheese,

07:59.280 --> 08:01.520
Cornish sea salt and Cornish cream.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.440
SPLAT

08:05.440 --> 08:08.360
LAUGHTER

08:09.880 --> 08:12.280
Covered in buttermilk!

08:18.160 --> 08:20.040
It's not funny!

08:25.880 --> 08:28.920
Yeah, I'm all right,
I'm carrying on. Yuck.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.920
So the bicarb
will react with the buttermilk

08:32.920 --> 08:35.280
and is what causes your soda bread
to rise.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.320
The bakers need to ensure
their chosen flavours

08:38.320 --> 08:40.720
work alongside the soft,
cakey dough.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.600
I'm gonna be trying to get
the black pudding

08:42.600 --> 08:44.960
as well-distributed
within the bread as possible.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.520
Any additional moisture or fat could
inhibit the rise of the soda bread

08:48.520 --> 08:51.760
or prevent it from baking through
properly.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.120
There's a lot of chopping
going on today.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.520
When it comes to her ingredients,
Hermine isn't playing it safe.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.880
I was trying to be
a bit adventurous.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.840
I thought I'd try salmon
and cheese.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.160
I don't even know
if that's a combination.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.640
SHE LAUGHS

09:08.640 --> 09:11.280
When she's not combining her
job as an accountant

09:11.280 --> 09:13.600
with being a single mother
to son Stephen...

09:13.600 --> 09:15.040
Oh, ooh, sorry.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.920
..Hermine enjoys a spot of knitting.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.520
Another scarf for Stephen.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.920
Hopefully it will be ready
for winter.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.800
She'll be hoping her salmon and
cheese flavours knit together well

09:25.800 --> 09:29.600
alongside her sweet loaf of dried
fruits soaked in orange liqueur.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.040
How much salmon have you got
going in? I've got 180 gram.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.720
How have you gone with practice?

09:36.480 --> 09:38.160
It's been all right, yes.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.520
There was a bit of dread
in your face then.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.240
NOEL LAUGHS

09:42.240 --> 09:44.760
And Hermine's not the only baker
taking a risk

09:44.760 --> 09:47.120
with their ingredients.
With za'atar,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.880
it's quite an overpowering flavour
if you allow it to be.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.680
When I was trying to make
the recipes I was asking my dad,

09:52.680 --> 09:54.280
I was like, "What should I do?"

09:54.280 --> 09:56.640
And he goes, "Well, you make
a really good Turkish pide,"

09:56.640 --> 09:58.440
and I always put za'atar
on top of it for him.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.760
He was like, "Why don't you
put that in your bread?"

10:00.760 --> 10:02.400
So I was like, this is for my dad.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.000
And it's not just Dad
giving out advice.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.440
Hospital pharmacist Sura
grew up surrounded by a family

10:08.440 --> 10:10.760
of women who loved to cook.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.760
Fond of incorporating her heritage
into her bakes,

10:13.760 --> 10:16.800
she'll be hoping
Middle Eastern flavours of za'atar,

10:16.800 --> 10:19.080
olive and dried fruits will impress.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.440
Are you confident?

10:20.440 --> 10:22.320
Uh, quietly confident.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.280
Look - he's trying to break you
but he can't, can't do it.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.680
I know - that's why I don't look
in his eyes. Too powerful.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.320
No-one can look into those eyes.
They'll turn to stone, right?

10:31.320 --> 10:33.200
Yeah, they turn to baking flour.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.080
Are you sure about that? No.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.480
I don't have a watch, do you? No.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.200
Just get that feeling though,
don't you,

10:45.200 --> 10:46.760
that they're halfway through. Yes.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.560
Interesting flavours.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
Hopefully they'll like it.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.960
Once their ingredients have been
introduced to the dough...

10:54.960 --> 10:56.360
Texture's reasonable.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.960
..the bakers can begin delicately
shaping their breads.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.360
Just try and bring it together

11:00.360 --> 11:02.720
as much as possible
without overworking it.

11:02.720 --> 11:06.280
Too much kneading will result in
dense, unrisen loaves.

11:06.280 --> 11:10.680
Want to make it smooth but make sure
that I'm not handling it too much.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.840
I'm just cutting the bread -
kind of lets it all puff up nicely.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.160
It lets it cook through better

11:16.160 --> 11:18.800
plus it's just a nice little bit
of decoration.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.480
It's in the oven at 200 degrees
for 30 minutes.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.640
One down.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.720
Right, I'm using a pizza stone
which I've brought from home.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.920
If you use a pizza stone, you get
a more even heat distribution

11:32.920 --> 11:35.640
and it also gives
a really nice crusty bottom.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.920
Laura likes to put her pizza stone
to good use

11:39.920 --> 11:42.240
at home with her husband Matt.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.840
You're king of the pizzas - I'll
stick to the baking. I'm pizza king.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.640
Laura's aiming for bold flavours
for both of her soda breads,

11:48.640 --> 11:50.960
tweaked from family recipes.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.320
The sweet bread,
it's sort of based on

11:53.320 --> 11:55.680
my Nana Peg's scones that she does.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.280
Soda bread's kind of like a scone.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.880
So I'm kind of doing this one
as like a bit of a tribute to her.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.920
And so I've just made my marzipan.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.640
I've found that when I put it in
in lumps

12:03.640 --> 12:06.000
it kind of goes very stodgy
so I'm gonna grate it in.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.480
Pretty sure this is
a new technique Paul's gonna hate.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.640
So I'm making my sweet soda bread
now,

12:15.640 --> 12:19.400
so I'm just crumbling the butter
into the flours and sugar -

12:19.400 --> 12:21.800
gives it more of a scone-like
texture.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.160
I mean, who makes sweet sofa bread?
What is that?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.520
I am making it today,
but it's not my finest work.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.440
It's a shame that Paul Hollywood's
judging it, eh?

12:29.440 --> 12:30.600
Cheers.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.080
When she's looking to unwind,
Lottie likes to relax on the beach

12:34.080 --> 12:35.960
with friends and family.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.240
Long summer afternoons
are Lottie's inspiration

12:39.240 --> 12:43.640
for her savoury summertime soda,
while her sweet ingredients

12:43.640 --> 12:46.640
are inspired by her favourite
breakfast of blueberry pancakes.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.160
How are the blueberries going in?
Well, they're going in whole.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.480
How many are you putting in?
Only 60g.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.760
So much how flour? 350.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.680
OK. Love that face. That's great.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.400
Maybe less, even. Less?
Maybe none.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.720
Maybe...no, more, more,
maybe more blueberries, yeah. More?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.760
No, none. I'm not putting in any.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.080
Start again.
Go back to square one.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.800
Call the whole thing off.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.400
For his sweet soda bread, Peter is
taking the soda element literally.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.080
The soda bread is gonna be
ginger beer flavour.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.520
This is some green ginger wine
that I'm adding in

13:18.520 --> 13:22.920
and then I'm also gonna add in just
some regular ginger beer as well,

13:22.920 --> 13:25.560
and so should have really nice,
good flavour.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.320
No, you've gotta layer it on there.
Yeah, a wee bit more.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.200
Finance student Peter loves to bake

13:30.200 --> 13:32.520
with his gluten-intolerant
brother Andrew

13:32.520 --> 13:33.920
back home in Edinburgh.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.920
That's fantastic finesse
and technique. I've spilled some.

13:36.920 --> 13:40.360
And in honour of Andrew,
he's making his black pudding,

13:40.360 --> 13:42.680
walnut and thyme loaf gluten-free.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.040
What are you using
as the rising agents in there?

13:45.040 --> 13:48.280
Just using bicarb as the rising
agent but I've got xanthe gum in it

13:48.280 --> 13:50.760
to bind it. Yeah.
And keep it all together. OK.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.920
For such a young head, you seem to
operate at quite a different level.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.280
Have you always been into cooking
and baking?

13:56.280 --> 13:59.400
Yeah, I've been into cooking
and baking for a very long time

13:59.400 --> 14:01.760
but it genuinely has been
shows like Bake Off.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.840
I mean, Bake Off's been around
for more than half of my life now,

14:04.840 --> 14:07.200
so it's...
THEY LAUGH

14:07.200 --> 14:10.600
..yeah, pretty cool.
That accounts for all the grey hair.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.000
All right, Old Father Time? Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Peter.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.680
The shape I'm going for
is to sort of replicate

14:21.680 --> 14:24.920
what a chocolate bar would be like.
Basically a Whole Nut bar.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.640
Like our Paul,
Dave is a bit of a petrolhead,

14:27.640 --> 14:31.040
and he also follows Mr Hollywood's
lead when it comes to baking.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.920
I was watching videos
of Paul Hollywood making it

14:33.920 --> 14:35.560
just to see how you do it.

14:35.560 --> 14:39.160
Dave's sweet loaf is inspired
by his favourite nut mix

14:39.160 --> 14:41.520
and he's confident
that bacon and cheese

14:41.520 --> 14:43.560
will prove to be
a savoury sensation.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.920
I really enjoyed coming up with
the flavours

14:45.920 --> 14:47.640
and making, like,
flavours that I like

14:47.640 --> 14:49.960
but also a lot of people
would like as well.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.320
That's ready...35 minutes.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.440
With their second soda breads
in the oven,

14:55.440 --> 14:58.560
it's time to concentrate on
the complementary butters.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.280
Butter, would you believe, is the
easiest thing to make in the world.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.120
At the moment
that's a thick double cream,

15:04.120 --> 15:06.560
and it'll go past that stage
and then turn into butter.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.880
And then when it curdles, you strain
all the milk fluids out of it

15:09.880 --> 15:11.640
and that's it.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.000
Never made butter.
I don't really know why you would.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.720
I mean, it's lovely, it's very twee,
but why would you make butter?

15:17.720 --> 15:20.040
I've just added some more
Irish stout into the butter

15:20.040 --> 15:21.840
just to give it a bit of a kick.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.360
This is from Mak, who left us,
sadly, on the last programme.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.200
He didn't have a chance to
showcase his honey,

15:28.200 --> 15:30.520
so that's going in for Mak.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.000
Black garlic tastes a bit like
balsamic vinegar.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.400
Don't ask me why I choose it.
I just thought I'd be a bit wild.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.160
Let's see if that works.
Or it could well be my ticket home.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.480
Paul's quite amazed at
your baking knowledge, isn't he,

15:47.480 --> 15:50.120
cos you're so young. I hope that
I'm showing some good knowledge.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.600
He fears you. He knows that
eventually the apprentice

15:52.600 --> 15:54.040
always kills the master.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.680
Be an interesting end
to Bake Off this year.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.720
So what is it, ten minutes?
I tell them they've got ten minutes?

16:01.720 --> 16:04.040
Yeah. OK. Ten minutes.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.800
QUIETLY: Bakers,
you have ten minutes.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.160
You might need to do it
a bit louder.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.840
LOUDLY: Bakers,
you have ten minutes.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.440
OK, let's see what we're
dealing with. It's hot. Ooh!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.800
So it's spread a little bit more
than I'd have liked,

16:16.800 --> 16:19.080
but no, it's traditional,
that shape so it's perfect.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.600
So I'm tapping it just to hear
if it's hollow inside.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.400
I think that's OK.
It's certainly cooked, anyway.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.360
It could be darker in colour,
but I don't want it to overcook.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.160
It's a bit of a take
on the Paddy's Pizza

16:31.160 --> 16:32.800
that I learned to make at school.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.360
Soda bread topped with tomato puree.
I want to do a little nod to that.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.000
I think I'm gonna take that out.
I'm going with it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.400
It is what it is.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.000
This one, it's very dense
with the marzipan,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.720
so it kind of just looks raw.
It's not.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.120
Is that not a sign, then,
that you shouldn't use marzipan?

16:47.120 --> 16:49.520
No, I grated it. Oh, did you? Yeah.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.400
I look forward to seeing
what happens.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.120
Mate, it's gonna be carnage.
Carnage!

16:55.120 --> 16:56.760
Oh, crumbs.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.120
That wasn't good.
It just broke off.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.600
We'll shove that to the back,
and they'll never know.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.760
Don't know if you've got enough
blueberries in there. Look, Noel...

17:04.760 --> 17:07.840
I just think if he says anything
about your cake that you don't like,

17:07.840 --> 17:10.920
just grab a handful of blueberries
and mush them in his face.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.200
Mush. Yeah, you should do it.
I won't.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.680
Think my orange zest is a bit thick.
It's not really coming through

17:17.680 --> 17:19.360
the piping nozzle.
It looks a bit messy.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.200
Bakers, you have one minute left,
so if you haven't started

17:23.200 --> 17:26.640
making your bread yet,
now is probably a good time.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.560
It looks kind of like a poo.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.640
Four-leaf clover.
I need plenty of luck.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.600
Scary moment.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.800
I think we're good. Hopefully
Nana Peg will be proud of that.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.720
Bakers, your time is up.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.400
Please step away from the breads.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.400
Someone should tell Linda
that's not doing anything.

17:59.812 --> 18:06.332
sponsors The Great British Bake Off.
CLATTERING

18:06.332 --> 18:07.212
sponsors The Great British Bake Off.
CLATTERING
The bakers' sweet and savoury soda
breads

18:07.212 --> 18:09.852
now face the judgment of Paul and
Prue.

18:09.852 --> 18:11.532
Hello, Mark. Hello. Hi, Mark. Hi.

18:14.932 --> 18:17.252
I mean, they're quite impressive.
I do like the stout one.

18:17.252 --> 18:18.772
It's the colour I expected it to be.

18:18.772 --> 18:21.092
This has been coloured quite a bit,

18:21.092 --> 18:23.052
but I don't really mind
that to be honest.

18:23.052 --> 18:26.812
So we've got a sobrasada
and an Irish sheep smoked cheddar.

18:26.812 --> 18:28.572
I think it's a decent soda bread.

18:28.572 --> 18:30.892
There is flavour in there,
but you've got to hunt it.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.092
I tell you what, it's delicious

18:32.092 --> 18:34.412
if you taste it with the top,
then you really get the flavour.

18:34.412 --> 18:35.692
Yeah, well, that's the cheese, yeah.

18:35.692 --> 18:38.572
And then I've got chocolate
and Irish stout.

18:38.572 --> 18:39.732
The chocolate comes through.

18:39.732 --> 18:40.812
It's very good.

18:40.812 --> 18:43.332
You do get the chocolate instantly
and then the stout lingers.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.532
That's a great loaf.

18:44.532 --> 18:46.892
And the butter's lovely. Thank you.
I think it's a good job. Thank you.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.772
Thank you. Thank you. Well done!

18:48.772 --> 18:50.372
HE EXHALES
Ooh!

18:53.212 --> 18:54.732
They look quite rustic,

18:54.732 --> 18:55.772
but both the same size.

18:55.772 --> 18:57.132
I think they look quite nice.

18:57.132 --> 18:59.652
The onions and the chorizo
go really well together.

18:59.652 --> 19:00.852
It's a little underbaked.

19:00.852 --> 19:03.372
It's a pity because
the edge is perfect.

19:03.372 --> 19:05.132
Right, glace cherry bread.

19:05.132 --> 19:06.692
Ooh, look at that.

19:06.692 --> 19:08.012
You can't taste the glace cherries,

19:08.012 --> 19:10.492
but I'm getting the marzipan, which
is delicious. Oh, it's delicious.

19:10.492 --> 19:13.252
The marzipan comes whacking
through. It's just lovely.

19:15.932 --> 19:17.532
There's a good crunch to it. Hmm.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.932
It's really lovely texture.
Beautiful.

19:19.932 --> 19:22.612
I think it's a great-tasting loaf.
So do I.

19:22.612 --> 19:24.932
You've chosen some flavours that
work in all breads,

19:24.932 --> 19:26.332
and olive is one of those.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.492
And my sweet is blueberry
and maple bacon.

19:29.492 --> 19:33.212
Well, the blueberries are not
exactly evenly spread, are they?

19:33.212 --> 19:35.012
But when I do get a blueberry,
it's delicious

19:35.012 --> 19:36.412
and the texture's really good.

19:36.412 --> 19:38.772
It's just that I'm missing the
bacon. It's wasted on the outside.

19:38.772 --> 19:40.852
A lot of it's just going to end up
on the plate, as we see there,

19:40.852 --> 19:44.052
and you're not going to taste it.
Thank you very much, Lottie.
Well done. Thank you.

19:47.492 --> 19:48.692
Think the loaves look great.

19:48.692 --> 19:52.052
It's very brave to take
the gluten-free option.

19:52.052 --> 19:53.612
It's difficult, though, isn't it?

19:53.612 --> 19:56.892
It's falling to bits a bit and then
it gets gluey in your mouth.

19:56.892 --> 19:58.852
OK. This is the ginger?

19:58.852 --> 19:59.932
Ginger beer, yeah.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.852
I love that, I think
the texture's beautiful.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.692
It's very cake-like, though,
isn't it?

20:03.692 --> 20:05.212
I just think it's a little bit
stodgy.

20:05.212 --> 20:06.612
I think the flavours are delicious.

20:06.612 --> 20:08.412
Your flavours are normally spot on.

20:12.732 --> 20:15.252
Very rustic, aren't they?
Yeah, they both look classic.

20:15.252 --> 20:16.732
Yeah, really good.

20:17.732 --> 20:19.012
I love that. Really?

20:19.012 --> 20:20.412
Mm. It's a nice loaf.

20:20.412 --> 20:23.212
If you get a mouthful of everything,
it's delicious. Yeah.

20:23.212 --> 20:25.492
Thank you. Thank you very much. OK.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.772
This one's a little doughier.

20:26.772 --> 20:28.252
Bit more cake-like.

20:28.252 --> 20:30.612
Nice flavour, though.
It's cranberries, is it?

20:30.612 --> 20:33.252
Cranberries, chocolate and sea
salt.

20:33.252 --> 20:34.492
I'm not getting the cranberry.

20:34.492 --> 20:35.972
It's just a little bit weak.

20:35.972 --> 20:37.372
Hmm. It just needs a bit more.

20:37.372 --> 20:38.932
Thank you. Thank you very much.

20:42.852 --> 20:45.172
They both look as if they
haven't risen quite enough.

20:45.172 --> 20:46.852
There are very big lumps of sausage.

20:46.852 --> 20:48.772
Oh, yes.

20:48.772 --> 20:50.532
Do you always like a large sausage?

20:50.532 --> 20:51.732
Don't care to comment.

20:51.732 --> 20:52.892
OK, fair enough.

20:52.892 --> 20:54.092
SNIGGERING

20:54.092 --> 20:57.012
Actually, the sausage is OK,
the olives are OK.

20:57.012 --> 20:59.372
The bread itself, I'd have
left it in longer. Right.

20:59.372 --> 21:01.732
See how wet it is?
Oh, that's why it's heavy.

21:01.732 --> 21:03.652
Yeah.
It would be nice if it was lighter.

21:05.892 --> 21:06.852
Wow.

21:06.852 --> 21:09.172
That much polenta in there, I think,
was a mistake.

21:09.172 --> 21:10.732
It's too gritty for me.

21:10.732 --> 21:14.532
It's a bit like eating a lemon
drizzle cake in a sandstorm.

21:17.932 --> 21:20.172
It looks as if it's risen nicely.

21:22.532 --> 21:25.132
Hasn't got enough flavour in it for
me. No?

21:25.132 --> 21:26.412
Did you put gruyere in there? Yes.

21:26.412 --> 21:28.692
You need double that. Treble that.
Yeah. OK.

21:30.972 --> 21:32.132
You do get the chocolate,

21:32.132 --> 21:34.492
you're just not getting enough in
each bite, that's my issue,

21:34.492 --> 21:36.292
which is a shame cos it's baked
well, actually.

21:36.292 --> 21:37.852
You made two very good loaves.

21:37.852 --> 21:40.092
You just need a bit more flavour.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.132
Let's try the za'atar one first.

21:45.132 --> 21:48.092
What temperature did you put them
in the oven? 160.

21:48.092 --> 21:49.692
That's why it's as pale as it is,

21:49.692 --> 21:52.052
but the blend of the olives
with the za'atar is delicious.

21:52.052 --> 21:53.492
Hmm, I like the flavour, too.

21:53.492 --> 21:56.172
Right, sweet one.
So the fruit's mostly apricots?

21:56.172 --> 21:59.212
Apricots, dried cherries and walnut.

21:59.212 --> 22:01.532
I think that is delicious.
Thank you.

22:01.532 --> 22:03.052
Really, really good.

22:03.052 --> 22:05.572
My only issue with both those
is your temperature choice.

22:05.572 --> 22:06.892
You should've baked it higher

22:06.892 --> 22:08.852
and it would've been spot on for
both of them.

22:08.852 --> 22:10.772
Thank you.
Thank you so much, thank you.

22:14.252 --> 22:16.892
I think they look good, but I hope
that's baked all the way through

22:16.892 --> 22:19.452
cos I get a bit worried
when they're that pale.

22:19.452 --> 22:21.132
Just needed a little
longer in the oven.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.772
It's such a pity
because the flavour is lovely.

22:23.772 --> 22:25.292
That's a bit soggy, too.

22:26.692 --> 22:30.092
Does have that spicy bara brith
flavour to it.

22:30.092 --> 22:33.132
When you try and push a load of
fruit into a loaf,

22:33.132 --> 22:35.892
if you shape it too tight, all
the fruit goes to the outside.

22:35.892 --> 22:37.812
If you look inside, there's nothing
in there.

22:37.812 --> 22:40.172
I like the flavour, but,
unfortunately, all the fruit burnt

22:40.172 --> 22:41.932
on the top of the loaf, not in it.
Yeah.

22:45.412 --> 22:47.292
I think, overall, they look really
nice.

22:47.292 --> 22:50.012
I think the idea of putting a smoked
salmon in it is so original.

22:50.012 --> 22:51.252
I've never had that.

22:51.252 --> 22:53.532
You invented a bread!

22:53.532 --> 22:54.692
That, I really like.

22:54.692 --> 22:56.052
The salmon in there really works.

22:56.052 --> 22:57.852
It's like a whole sandwich all in
one.

22:57.852 --> 22:59.612
The aftertaste is lovely as well.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.572
It's nice, that, and it's well
baked. Thank you.

23:02.812 --> 23:07.212
Well, that's a very grown-up fruit
cake. Lots of booze. Lovely!

23:07.212 --> 23:09.532
I've soaked the fruit
a couple of weeks.

23:09.532 --> 23:11.492
A couple of weeks? Are you serious?

23:11.492 --> 23:14.052
Wow. She wanted us to taste it.
It's lovely. Thank you.

23:14.052 --> 23:16.732
Hermine, I think they're very
special. I really do.

23:16.732 --> 23:18.612
GASPING

23:18.612 --> 23:20.412
Thank you.

23:20.412 --> 23:23.212
Do you know what I love? I love the
fact that I've never had 'em before

23:23.212 --> 23:25.172
and this is what Bake Off's all
about.

23:25.172 --> 23:27.892
This is really, really complex in
its flavours.

23:27.892 --> 23:29.212
I love it, I think it's special.

23:29.212 --> 23:31.012
Well done.

23:31.012 --> 23:34.892
That's it - I'm packing.
Time to go home.

23:34.892 --> 23:37.772
That's 2020 over!

23:37.772 --> 23:39.612
That went better than I expected.

23:39.612 --> 23:43.212
I was terrified, I'll be honest with
you, but the flavour queen is back.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.492
The comments were not
entirely positive,

23:48.492 --> 23:51.372
but I'm very determined,
learning from the last technical,

23:51.372 --> 23:54.732
to spend a bit of time thinking and
not just dashing straight into it.

23:59.532 --> 24:02.492
Bread week isn't about to
get any easier.

24:02.492 --> 24:05.972
Our ten bakers will now face
a technical...with a twist.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.532
Bakers, it's time for your technical
challenge,

24:10.532 --> 24:13.012
which, today, has been set by Paul.

24:13.012 --> 24:14.612
Paul, any words of advice?

24:14.612 --> 24:17.692
You need to get your timings right.

24:19.652 --> 24:23.012
Yeah, he said words of advice,
not just words.

24:23.012 --> 24:25.372
As ever, your technical
challenge will be judged blind

24:25.372 --> 24:28.092
so we're going to have to ask these
two rascals to skedaddle.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.332
Off you pop.

24:29.332 --> 24:30.892
# Go on now, go

24:30.892 --> 24:32.892
# Walk out the door

24:32.892 --> 24:35.172
# Just turn around now

24:35.172 --> 24:37.092
# You're not welcome any more. #

24:39.652 --> 24:45.252
So, Paul would like you to bake
six rainbow-coloured bagels.

24:45.252 --> 24:48.812
Rainbow coloured bagels are the same
as normal bagels,

24:48.812 --> 24:51.292
just with five different-coloured
doughs.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.652
Layered, shaped then boiled
and baked

24:53.652 --> 24:56.012
to achieve a lovely, shiny, chewy
crust.

24:56.012 --> 24:57.172
Chewy crust.

24:57.172 --> 25:00.652
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

25:00.652 --> 25:01.812
On your marks.

25:01.812 --> 25:03.212
Get set.

25:03.212 --> 25:04.492
Bake.

25:06.452 --> 25:07.892
Oh, my God.

25:07.892 --> 25:09.692
What the hell is a rainbow bagel?

25:09.692 --> 25:10.692
I mean...

25:12.012 --> 25:13.012
No idea.

25:14.172 --> 25:19.932
Never made them before, certainly
not a rainbow one, so...interesting.

25:19.932 --> 25:22.492
I have made bagels before,
but I don't want to say, like,

25:22.492 --> 25:24.972
"Oh, I've made bagels before and
then they come out awful."

25:24.972 --> 25:27.772
Kind of makes sense when you
read it through. Just go with it.

25:29.012 --> 25:32.812
There's a bagel shop near work
so I've seen how they make it,

25:32.812 --> 25:35.132
but I've never made it myself.

25:35.132 --> 25:37.532
I wouldn't have to - it's right
there.

25:37.532 --> 25:38.532
Paul.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.372
Paul, why rainbow-coloured bagels?

25:43.372 --> 25:45.732
Well, I think bagels are a great
challenge when you're making bread.

25:45.732 --> 25:49.132
You've got to boil them, which is
unusual, and then bake them as well.

25:49.132 --> 25:51.492
I think the rainbow colours
for me, although it originated

25:51.492 --> 25:54.652
over in the States, I think it
represents the NHS.

25:54.652 --> 25:55.772
Well, it does now.

25:55.772 --> 25:57.572
It does now, certainly.

25:57.572 --> 26:00.492
Now, basically, what they've got to
do is roll each piece, each colour,

26:00.492 --> 26:03.012
into a rectangle and then you lay
the next one on the top

26:03.012 --> 26:04.372
all the way up. You stack them.

26:04.372 --> 26:08.772
Yes, and twist it to create that
spiral and then you seal.

26:08.772 --> 26:12.612
You plunge it in the water for
anything between 15 and 40 seconds

26:12.612 --> 26:14.452
and then pop in the oven,
bake it off.

26:14.452 --> 26:16.132
Can we taste them? Absolutely.

26:16.132 --> 26:17.892
What could go wrong?

26:17.892 --> 26:20.772
You can overprove and underprove
very easily on a bagel.

26:20.772 --> 26:23.252
If they've overproved it before
it's gone in the water or

26:23.252 --> 26:25.852
if they leave it in the water too
long, it will flatten in the oven.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.332
It's absolutely delicious.

26:27.332 --> 26:29.732
It's even brighter
inside than it is outside.

26:29.732 --> 26:31.172
Pretty vibrant, Prue.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.452
They may have made bagels before,

26:32.452 --> 26:34.292
but I guarantee they wouldn't have
made 'em like this.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.972
I've never made them like this.

26:35.972 --> 26:38.972
Happy bread. Happy bread,
that's what it is.

26:41.012 --> 26:43.332
Make and knead the dough.

26:43.332 --> 26:45.612
It's, erm...scant, isn't it, at
best?

26:46.612 --> 26:49.132
So I normally would just chuck
it in a stand mixer.

26:49.132 --> 26:51.452
We're definitely getting a full
workout today.

26:51.452 --> 26:53.692
We're in 2020. Who kneads by hand?

26:55.372 --> 26:58.372
I know it needs to be kneaded
a good amount for a bagel

26:58.372 --> 27:00.892
so I'm going to be working this
until it's super, super smooth.

27:00.892 --> 27:03.612
Think it's got to be quite
a stretchy, elastic dough.

27:03.612 --> 27:06.372
It still feels a little tight.

27:06.372 --> 27:08.652
Stretch and tear, that's how to go.

27:08.652 --> 27:10.452
Rowan's doing the slap already.

27:10.452 --> 27:11.812
Whack it.

27:11.812 --> 27:14.292
It's very therapeutic, it really is.

27:14.292 --> 27:18.172
So disappointed that there aren't
any rainbows in a rainbow bagel.

27:18.172 --> 27:19.252
Real rainbows?

27:19.252 --> 27:21.252
I wanted you to have to go
and catch a rainbow.

27:21.252 --> 27:25.132
Yeah. Lasso it, chop it up,
grate it into the bagel.

27:25.132 --> 27:27.652
But, no, it's just some coloured
bread.

27:29.012 --> 27:30.572
I think that must be about it now.

27:30.572 --> 27:33.852
And then it says to divide
the dough into five pieces.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.772
We colour them each a
different colour.

27:36.772 --> 27:38.732
I've never done coloured bread
before

27:38.732 --> 27:41.052
so it's all part of the voyage
of discovery, really.

27:41.052 --> 27:42.332
It's a very messy business.

27:42.332 --> 27:45.492
# Red and yellow and
pink and green... #

27:45.492 --> 27:46.812
SHE CHUCKLES

27:46.812 --> 27:49.652
Don't know the words to the
rainbow song.

27:49.652 --> 27:52.012
I suspect they want to be nice
and vibrant.

27:52.012 --> 27:54.932
It's really hard to
mix in all the colours.

27:54.932 --> 27:57.812
I might have used too much, just
judging by the fact that

27:57.812 --> 28:00.932
no-one else's bench is the same
colour as mine.

28:00.932 --> 28:03.372
You're a Smurf, aren't you? Yes.

28:04.652 --> 28:06.412
Right, that'll do. I'm over that.

28:06.412 --> 28:08.332
Number four, rise.

28:08.332 --> 28:10.012
Exceptionally descriptive.

28:10.012 --> 28:11.532
Arise, sir dough.

28:11.532 --> 28:14.212
I'm going to leave it to prove
until it's doubled in size.

28:14.212 --> 28:15.932
It's only small pieces.

28:15.932 --> 28:19.252
I'm going to go about 20 minutes
to start with.

28:19.252 --> 28:20.372
And breathe.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.972
I would normally snooze
or play the piano, actually,

28:24.972 --> 28:27.652
while the dough was rising or
perhaps do a spot of gardening.

28:27.652 --> 28:30.052
I could nip outside and do
a little bit of pruning.

28:34.372 --> 28:38.772
If you prod and it leaves a slight
indent, then they're ready to go,

28:38.772 --> 28:41.812
so they're doing all of that so
I think it's time to go with them.

28:41.812 --> 28:45.612
Going to start rolling them
out in colour order, so red first.

28:45.612 --> 28:48.012
Is this from the handshake?

28:49.212 --> 28:51.172
Is this what happens with Paul?

28:51.172 --> 28:52.412
That's his fake tan.

28:54.052 --> 28:56.572
You know they can take handshakes
back? Oh, yeah.

28:56.572 --> 28:58.292
They'll just reverse the footage.

28:59.972 --> 29:00.972
It'll be like...

29:02.252 --> 29:05.732
Roll out to a rectangle,
measuring 15 by 12 centimetres.

29:05.732 --> 29:08.332
I'm just going to check what
15 centimetres looks like,

29:08.332 --> 29:09.492
just so I know.

29:09.492 --> 29:11.212
What are you comparing it against?

29:11.212 --> 29:13.012
Just half the ruler, Dave.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.892
HE CHUCKLES

29:14.892 --> 29:17.852
So you're actually just layering
the doughs.

29:17.852 --> 29:20.212
I'm just trying to get
some kind of evenness.

29:20.212 --> 29:22.172
It's like making very brightly
coloured mattresses.

29:22.172 --> 29:24.172
They're very bouncy and very
illuminous.

29:24.172 --> 29:26.572
So now I'm cutting
the dough into six.

29:26.572 --> 29:29.052
You have to do, roll and twist
the dough to a rope

29:29.052 --> 29:31.532
measuring approximately
24 centimetres long.

29:31.532 --> 29:33.212
You are approximately 24.

29:33.212 --> 29:35.612
I am, aren't I? We've got
the 24 centimetres. Yeah.

29:35.612 --> 29:38.252
How many inches is that?
I think in inches.

29:38.252 --> 29:39.972
Erm, that's nine and a half inches.

29:41.292 --> 29:43.172
I think that's respectable myself.

29:43.172 --> 29:46.892
Kind of pull back on this palm
and go forward on this palm.

29:48.652 --> 29:49.932
Oh, dear.

29:49.932 --> 29:52.452
This is a rainbow, isn't it?

29:52.452 --> 29:53.452
There you go.

29:55.812 --> 29:58.172
Just got to try
and seal this bit now.

29:59.132 --> 30:01.012
Gently roll backwards and forwards.

30:01.012 --> 30:02.372
Don't get it.

30:02.372 --> 30:04.652
I don't want it to fall apart.

30:04.652 --> 30:05.812
Haven't got a clue!

30:07.412 --> 30:10.252
It's not too bad. Once you get
the knack of it, it's like, woo!

30:12.172 --> 30:15.052
Oh, look - everyone's twisted
theirs. I didn't twist mine.

30:15.052 --> 30:17.812
I think it's about right cos they're
going to expand so that hole's going

30:17.812 --> 30:20.132
to shrink and I think by the time
it's expanded and shrunk,

30:20.132 --> 30:21.372
it should be about right.

30:21.372 --> 30:24.612
It does say twist, it does say
twist. Does it? Yeah.

30:24.612 --> 30:26.132
It says "roll and twist".

30:28.492 --> 30:32.212
Bakers, you are halfway through.

30:32.212 --> 30:34.812
And number ten is "prove".

30:34.812 --> 30:37.252
Just the one word in that step.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.532
He's not very elaborate, is he?

30:38.532 --> 30:41.372
So I want to give them as much
time as possible, really.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.852
I think the trick with these is the
timing.

30:43.852 --> 30:46.412
The second prove is really going to
be the one for texture.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.972
Try that again, shall we?

30:47.972 --> 30:49.732
I'll put the drawer up a bit warmer,

30:49.732 --> 30:52.052
see if we can get a quicker prove on
the go.

30:52.052 --> 30:53.652
And we'll see how we get on.

30:53.652 --> 30:57.492
Judging the right time to stop
the final prove is critical.

30:57.492 --> 30:59.252
It's even driven me to drink green
tea.

30:59.252 --> 31:01.212
Come on. That's gin, we know. Yeah.

31:01.212 --> 31:03.732
If I was on this competition,
I'd drink though it.

31:03.732 --> 31:04.852
I've started drinking.

31:04.852 --> 31:06.292
I've not drank for four years.

31:06.292 --> 31:09.132
Here, I've started
drinking in the evening.

31:09.132 --> 31:11.412
If the bagels are underproved...

31:11.412 --> 31:12.532
Anything happening in there?

31:12.532 --> 31:16.932
..they won't have the dome-like rise
that Paul and Prue are expecting.

31:16.932 --> 31:18.372
Oh, check you out!

31:19.692 --> 31:21.252
They're looking good!

31:21.252 --> 31:23.052
It doesn't look bad, actually.

31:23.052 --> 31:24.372
Reckon they're about ready.

31:24.372 --> 31:26.332
Right, glasses off.

31:26.332 --> 31:30.692
"And bring a saucepan of water to a
boil. Add the bicarbonate of soda."

31:30.692 --> 31:31.732
If they're overproved,

31:31.732 --> 31:34.172
they'll puff up too much when they
hit the water...

31:34.172 --> 31:36.212
Who's going to take the plunge
first?

31:36.212 --> 31:38.772
..and collapse before
they go into the oven.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.132
So let's have a look.

31:41.132 --> 31:44.652
It's where I feel a bit nervous
cos I don't think they cook long.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.492
"Cook until the bagels are puffed
and the shape has set."

31:47.492 --> 31:51.892
I think this is what gives the
bagels that chewy kind of texture.

31:51.892 --> 31:56.332
So I'm boiling them for about
30 to 45 seconds on each side.

31:56.332 --> 31:59.052
I have no idea whether that's done.

31:59.052 --> 32:01.932
You seen the size of them?
They're huge.

32:01.932 --> 32:04.852
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

32:04.852 --> 32:05.932
Have I missed it? Yes.

32:09.452 --> 32:11.212
Not doing any more than that.

32:11.212 --> 32:13.492
They go in looking good
and then things happen.

32:15.212 --> 32:17.532
SHE GASPS
This is not a bagel.

32:17.532 --> 32:18.932
This is a unicorn horn.

32:18.932 --> 32:20.012
It's hard to know, isn't it?

32:20.012 --> 32:22.532
I know, especially when you've never
made them before.

32:22.532 --> 32:25.652
Why don't you, like, look up
and see what other people are doing?

32:25.652 --> 32:27.932
I have been, but theirs aren't
looking terribly good either.

32:29.372 --> 32:32.412
Is that set? So hard to know.
Let's have 'em in a bit longer.

32:32.412 --> 32:33.772
Ooh!

32:33.772 --> 32:37.252
Paul Hollywood is definitely taking
his handshake back cos these...

32:37.252 --> 32:38.452
Hmm.

32:38.452 --> 32:40.732
Yeah, so that's them all boiled now.

32:40.732 --> 32:42.412
Even though they've doubled in size,

32:42.412 --> 32:44.692
they seem to have lost it when I've
boiled them.

32:46.052 --> 32:47.212
I got it.

32:47.212 --> 32:49.732
This one opened up,
but don't tell Paul.

32:49.732 --> 32:51.252
But I've stuck it back together

32:51.252 --> 32:53.932
and hopefully it'll just glue back
together in the oven.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.852
Going into the oven now.

32:55.852 --> 32:57.652
It just says bake.

32:57.652 --> 32:59.572
We'll see what the oven does with
'em.

32:59.572 --> 33:01.532
Could be just a case of getting
a nice crust on them.

33:01.532 --> 33:02.692
20 maximum, I think.

33:02.692 --> 33:04.332
I don't know for how long.

33:04.332 --> 33:06.652
I'm hoping they'll puff up again

33:06.652 --> 33:10.332
and it will disguise the wrinkly
bits they've now got.

33:10.332 --> 33:13.932
Ba-bakers, you've got, ooh...
ten minutes left!

33:13.932 --> 33:15.692
That's not very much time, is it?

33:17.132 --> 33:18.572
So how do you know they're ready?

33:18.572 --> 33:20.892
Cos normally they'll get brown.

33:20.892 --> 33:22.692
These got colour.

33:22.692 --> 33:24.532
My blue's way too dark.

33:24.532 --> 33:26.892
I really don't know what
I'm looking for.

33:26.892 --> 33:29.252
I'm not loving what's going
on inside there.

33:29.252 --> 33:31.212
I think they're a bit too thin and
too wide.

33:31.212 --> 33:34.332
I think they're going to want them
to be a bit...puffier.

33:34.332 --> 33:36.612
They in there? They're in there.

33:36.612 --> 33:38.372
They're looking pretty good.

33:38.372 --> 33:39.772
Yours not so much.

33:39.772 --> 33:41.612
Oh, look, Sura looks sad.

33:41.612 --> 33:43.012
You all right? Yeah.

33:43.012 --> 33:44.052
Do you want a piggy back?

33:44.052 --> 33:45.052
No. OK.

33:46.332 --> 33:47.732
Do not want to overbake them.

33:47.732 --> 33:48.772
Another minute.

33:48.772 --> 33:50.012
What have we got?

33:50.012 --> 33:52.372
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

33:52.372 --> 33:53.372
Ohhh!

33:55.932 --> 33:58.252
I'm just looking to make sure
they're not going too brown.

33:58.252 --> 34:00.052
They look great, Linda.

34:00.052 --> 34:01.692
Mine are all kind of wrinkled.

34:01.692 --> 34:04.292
And they have been
boiled for some time.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.292
I think I'm going to take 'em out.

34:07.932 --> 34:09.772
That looks good. Well done.

34:11.412 --> 34:13.252
They sound hollow, so...

34:13.252 --> 34:14.772
Yeah, they sound done.

34:16.612 --> 34:18.892
Flat as pancakes.

34:18.892 --> 34:20.372
Bakers, your time is up.

34:22.412 --> 34:24.172
That's not a bagel.

34:24.172 --> 34:27.812
I'll be honest...I think
I've overcooked all of them.

34:27.812 --> 34:29.452
Just strategic placing.

34:29.452 --> 34:30.652
LAUGHTER

34:30.652 --> 34:32.492
Exactly!

34:32.492 --> 34:34.412
Mine seem kind of soft and
wrinkly...

34:34.412 --> 34:35.892
..which is not attractive!

34:42.080 --> 34:46.480
Paul and Prue are looking for six
vibrant, rainbow-coloured bagels

34:46.480 --> 34:49.720
that are smooth and crisp on the
outside and slightly chewy inside.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.680
We've got the five vivid colours.

34:51.680 --> 34:52.880
LAUGHTER

34:52.880 --> 34:53.960
Right...

34:55.640 --> 34:57.400
These aren't too bad.
You've got the colours.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.280
And they're quite smooth.
And quite light.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.280
They're a lot smaller
than most of the others.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.440
They're a good size.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.400
Nice and soft,
crispy on the outside.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.720
Very nice. It's nice bread.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.080
All the same size, nice and smooth

35:10.080 --> 35:12.400
and the crumb's really tasty
as well.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.680
Good. Very good.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.600
Right, moving on to the Hula Hoops.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.240
These are a little bit big
and, actually, it's overproved.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.560
It's flat.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.720
Tastes all right, though.
Mm, tastes fine.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.760
Moving on to these whoppers.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.000
They haven't been twisted.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.720
You can see where it's joined,
but it's just gone round as one.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.720
Colours are nice -
very bright and vibrant.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.080
Nice flavour, though.
It's a nice flavour. Good texture.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.680
Right, moving on to this.
Very, very flat.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.320
Again, they've been overproved
before they went in the water

35:38.320 --> 35:40.200
and then afterwards,
they'd lost all their height.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.400
Taste great, though.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.120
Now, these are a little bit dark.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.680
Just feel the crispiness here.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.120
BAGEL CRUNCHES
Yeah.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.720
But, actually,
the shape, pretty uniform.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.320
It's actually... They're not too
bad. Just slightly overbaked.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.960
Now these, again, have had the issue
with the water, overproved.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.680
You can see the marks on it.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.560
That's not at all crisp
and it's soft.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.960
Underbaked. The flavour's OK,
though. Flavour's fine.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.320
Now, these aren't bad,
these are fairly smooth,

36:05.320 --> 36:08.080
but they've just overdone it
slightly in the water.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.840
Good flavour.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.240
These are overbaked again.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.520
You see how dark they've gone?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.800
They're not very attractive.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.720
Bit tough.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.960
These are big.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.000
They look more like pretzels,
but they're vibrant colours,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.400
and they are pretty smooth.
Mm.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.400
Yeah. That is delicious.
It is nice.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.920
Now, moving on to the last one.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.840
Lost its way a little bit
in the shaping,

36:30.840 --> 36:32.440
but also with the water as well.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.800
Again, see, the marks?

36:35.160 --> 36:36.440
Nice bread, though.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.440
OK, this is going to be interesting
to judge.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.760
MATT: Paul and Prue
will now rank the bagels...

36:41.760 --> 36:43.560
That one second from the end's good.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.200
..from worst to best.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.680
So, in last place...

36:46.680 --> 36:48.360
..we have this one.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.680
Rowan, they are overproved
and underbaked.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.440
In ninth spot we have this one.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.040
You've actually managed to bake this
one, but it is overproved.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.720
And then, in eighth place,
we have this one.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.200
Sura, lovely colour.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.840
Your twisting wasn't perfect.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.400
It was a little bit wobbly.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.320
NOEL: Hermine is seventh,
Laura is sixth,

37:07.320 --> 37:09.840
Lottie, fifth,
and Peter, fourth.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.720
In third, we have this one.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.080
Not bad at all.
You've managed to get a nice colour.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.480
It's got the nice twist in there.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.000
And in second place...

37:18.640 --> 37:19.840
..we have this one.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.560
Who's that? Marc,
they are really nice bagels.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.960
They're properly risen, good effort.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.440
And in first place,
we have this one.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.200
Well done, Linda.
It's nice and chewy.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.800
You've got lovely colours inside
with the flavour as well.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.600
Thank you.
They tasted really good.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.880
WHISPERS: Well done, Linda.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.520
Oh, wow! What a high.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.280
Can't wait to tell my family.
I can't wait to tell Richard.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.120
I'll ring him up
and I'll just go, "Argh!"

37:46.400 --> 37:47.760
That was a good result for me.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.680
The last two Technicals,
I've not fared too well,

37:49.680 --> 37:51.480
so, yeah, I was really happy
with that one.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.040
Well, I had a fabulous time.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.840
It was a really good challenge.
The result wasn't great.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.200
Tomorrow, we can do better.
Got to do better.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.880
MATT: Just one challenge remains.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.320
So, Bread Week, something
very close to your heart, Paul.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.680
I think, overall, the standards have
been pretty good.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.040
It was nice to give out
a handshake to Hermine.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.040
I think she did really well. Yeah.
Very clever.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.320
She invented a new genre of bread.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.400
But, for Star Baker, I think

38:19.400 --> 38:21.440
she struggled a little bit
in the Technical.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.000
I'm not saying she's not.
There are a couple of other people.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.640
Both Marks have done well
in Signature and Technical. Yeah.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.080
And, actually, Lottie as well.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.840
Lottie described
herself as a swan.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.520
She said, "Oh, you don't know what's
going on beneath the surface."

38:32.520 --> 38:33.720
She is not swan like.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.360
She's always just going, "Urgh...!"

38:35.360 --> 38:38.160
I've never seen a swan
panicking that hard.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.600
"Urgh...!"

38:39.600 --> 38:40.760
Who's in trouble?

38:40.760 --> 38:43.600
I think Rowan, he's in difficulty
this week again.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.080
Those soda breads,
one was a polenta cake.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.400
One was a sandpit.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.240
LAUGHS: It was very sandy.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.520
I think David's actually done OK,
but he is slipping down there.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.600
MENACINGLY: Curse of the Star Baker!

38:54.600 --> 38:56.960
Ultimately, it's quite a tricky
Showstopper today,

38:56.960 --> 38:59.320
but what I'd like to see is all
the bakers complete the task -

38:59.320 --> 39:00.760
including Rowan.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.040
Interesting. Interesting.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.600
I think I'm in love with you.

39:06.120 --> 39:09.560
Shall we talk about this later?
I think we should talk about it now.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.200
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.120
It's time for
your Showstopper Challenge.

39:20.120 --> 39:24.560
Today, the judges would like you to
make a large decorative bread plaque

39:24.560 --> 39:27.960
in the style of a traditional
harvest festival sheaf.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.640
Giving your own take on the sheaf,
your bread plaque must portray

39:31.640 --> 39:34.120
the one thing
you are most grateful for.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.960
Your bread must be impressive
in size, visually powerful

39:37.960 --> 39:40.280
and, of course, it's got to be
delish-delosh.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.320
You have three hours and 30 minutes.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.120
COCKNEY ACCENT:
Don't seem long enough!

39:44.120 --> 39:46.480
COCKNEY ACCENT: I know, they've been
done up like a kipper!

39:46.480 --> 39:48.040
On your marks...
..get set...

39:48.040 --> 39:49.040
..bake!

39:51.480 --> 39:53.960
Feeling nervous today.
It's a big one.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.280
Traditionally the harvest plaque
is completely inedible

39:56.280 --> 39:57.840
and rock hard and varnished,

39:57.840 --> 40:00.280
so to have to make it utterly
delicious,

40:00.280 --> 40:02.120
it's quite a challenge, really.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.440
HE EXHALES
Bricking it.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.840
Now, the bread plaque itself must be

40:05.840 --> 40:08.360
a celebration of something that
the bakers are thankful for.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.120
It could be your house, it could be
their health - it could be anything.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.520
But it's really easy to sit there

40:14.520 --> 40:16.880
and design something
elaborate on paper.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.360
It's not anything like easy
to make it in bread.

40:21.720 --> 40:26.120
It's about manipulating dough
itself, using knife techniques,

40:26.120 --> 40:28.440
plaiting, twisting, spiralling
the bread.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.680
I think it's a great challenge

40:29.680 --> 40:31.400
because it'll give me the indication

40:31.400 --> 40:34.320
of how far these bakers have
travelled on their bread journey.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.840
And I hope they've practised it

40:35.840 --> 40:39.200
because they'll never get it right
if they haven't.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.280
NOEL: To give their elaborate
plaques different flavours, textures

40:42.280 --> 40:46.720
and shapes, all of the bakers have
chosen to make multiple breads.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.280
LOTTIE: I'm making three breads,

40:48.280 --> 40:50.160
there's a lot of multitasking
going on.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.960
There's no time for faffery today.

40:52.960 --> 40:56.960
So, I'm doing two breads - a basic
white bread, a wholemeal bread

40:56.960 --> 41:01.360
and then, around the edges, I've got
this Tibetan monastery bread.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.800
Flavoured with fennel,
coriander and caraway seeds,

41:03.800 --> 41:06.120
Marc's bread will be swirled
together

41:06.120 --> 41:08.120
to form a Buddhist dharma wheel.

41:08.120 --> 41:10.160
Are you a Buddhist?
Is this what you're grateful for?

41:10.160 --> 41:13.840
I'm not a Buddhist, no, but after I
had the accident where I lost my leg

41:13.840 --> 41:16.160
and I wasn't in a very good place...

41:16.160 --> 41:18.800
..and just trying to come to terms
with what had happened,

41:18.800 --> 41:20.200
I picked up a wonderful book.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.920
It was about the philosophy
of Buddhism.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.920
It made it a lot clearer what
I needed to do to kind of still

41:24.920 --> 41:27.520
live a life and make my life
worth living, you know?

41:27.520 --> 41:30.080
So this, yeah, it means
a lot to me, this one.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.680
I'm going to knead it
for about ten minutes.

41:34.680 --> 41:35.880
It's not too sticky.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.320
More smooth and silky.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.160
SHE SIGHS

41:39.160 --> 41:42.200
Nowhere near ready.
Give it some real welly.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.400
Good bit of exercise, which
I'm slightly missing at the moment.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.400
I just absolutely love
this part about bread.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.720
You can put so much feeling into it.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.760
Can put a lot of love into it,
you know?

41:52.760 --> 41:56.600
Linda's putting her love
into two family favourite.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.240
A black olive plait will frame
tiger bread animals that she helped

42:00.240 --> 42:02.520
look after on her uncle's farm.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.480
As a kid, I used to milk the cows

42:04.480 --> 42:07.520
and we used to carry the buckets
of milk up through the farm

42:07.520 --> 42:10.000
to my auntie's kitchen,
where she made beautiful cakes.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.360
So rural idyll, isn't it?
Beautiful. Oh, yeah.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.720
You've really gone for the harvest
theme, then, haven't you?

42:14.720 --> 42:17.720
Absolutely, yeah.
It's all about that circle of life.

42:17.720 --> 42:20.600
All right, thank you, Linda.
Thank you. Thank you. Good luck.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.520
Shape of that bottle even reminds me
of the milk churns.

42:23.520 --> 42:26.320
It's a wonderful memory. Mm!

42:26.320 --> 42:29.520
I'll have a little pipe
in a minute.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.880
ROWAN EXHALES
La-la, la-la, la-la, la...

42:31.880 --> 42:35.040
Linda's not the only baker
celebrating the good life.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.800
I'm feeling very grateful
for my life in Worcestershire

42:38.800 --> 42:42.560
and the wonderful countryside
and the theatre, literature

42:42.560 --> 42:46.160
and music that form such
a big part of my life there.

42:46.160 --> 42:50.560
Rowan's huge plaque will be
made of three flavoured breads

42:50.560 --> 42:53.240
and shaped into Worcestershire's
coat of arms - the pear tree.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.840
He's hoping it'll be enough

42:54.840 --> 42:57.560
to make up for yesterday's
Technical disaster.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.840
Did you come...? Last!

42:59.840 --> 43:01.320
Did you? Of course, yeah.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.040
But if you smash this, then...

43:03.040 --> 43:07.440
But it's probably curtains,
but I'm going to have fun anyway.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.240
I love your attitude.
And also - look at your boots.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.080
This is strong boot game right here.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.440
Look at that, look at that.
Look at these two guys.

43:13.440 --> 43:15.800
While Rowan's taking on
the biggest bread plaque...

43:15.800 --> 43:18.200
It seems to be enormous
compared with everybody else's.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.520
..Hermine might have the most
ambitious plan of them all.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.120
The plan is to make
an enriched dough.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.240
Something to close a brioche.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.200
It can't be a brioche
in three and a half hours.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.560
What have you cut back on
to get it done in the time?

43:32.560 --> 43:34.560
I haven't cut back on anything.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.600
It's supposed to stay
in the fridge overnight,

43:37.600 --> 43:40.440
but I'm going to put it
in the freezer on both sides

43:40.440 --> 43:45.240
for about 15 minutes to harden
the butter so that I can then work.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.600
Quite risky.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.000
I agree.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.440
Hermine's brioche will form
the border of her focaccia

43:51.440 --> 43:54.880
and breadstick plaque
recreating her annual road trips

43:54.880 --> 43:57.960
from London to Paris
to visit family and friends.

43:57.960 --> 44:01.240
They might say it's risky,
doing an enriched dough,

44:01.240 --> 44:03.720
but I like doing it,
so I'm going to do it anyway.

44:03.720 --> 44:06.240
We shall see.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.160
While Hermine is
heading to the freezer...

44:08.160 --> 44:09.520
Think that's probably done now.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.440
Yeah, can you see,
the light's coming through?

44:11.440 --> 44:12.720
So that's good to go.

44:12.720 --> 44:13.960
Proving drawer - there it is.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.720
..the other bakers
are ready to start proving.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.080
Grow. So that's in for an hour.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.720
Quite warm in here today,

44:19.720 --> 44:22.680
so hopefully it'll just rise
without having to force it up.

44:22.680 --> 44:24.000
I'm going to go by eye today.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.160
Set the timer for 40 minutes
and just see how it looks.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.760
With one dough down...

44:28.760 --> 44:30.600
Right back to some kneading.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.880
..the process starts all over again.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.000
MARC: I've added fresh yeast.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.440
The first load will go 15.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.080
We'll give this one 20, just to let
it kind of catch up a little bit.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.880
So, in theory, this should all be
proved around the same time.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.920
And if juggling multiple doughs
wasn't tricky enough...

44:46.000 --> 44:48.560
This is the most manic bit.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.520
..some of the bakers have chosen
to make fillings as well.

44:51.520 --> 44:53.840
The mango, lime and chilli taste is,
like,

44:53.840 --> 44:55.440
my signature flavour for bread.

44:55.440 --> 44:56.680
It's just fantastic.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.320
That smells delish.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.000
I've got a focaccia base which is
stuffed with pancetta,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.320
Padano and Gruyere cheese.

45:03.320 --> 45:06.120
It's basically a posh cheese
and ham sandwich.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.280
Laura's stuffed focaccia
will take centre stage

45:09.280 --> 45:10.640
of her musical-themed plaque

45:10.640 --> 45:14.160
which will be adorned with
spicy fougasse curtains and masks.

45:14.160 --> 45:17.320
I've probably seen about 70 shows
in the West End.

45:17.320 --> 45:18.920
And I've seen none. Really?

45:18.920 --> 45:21.280
You've never been to
a West End musical? No, never.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.680
Call yourself a gay man?!
Honestly, terrible.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.120
When this show is over,
we are hitting the town! OK.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.080
We're going to take him to Wicked...
Yeah.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.920
..Mamma Mia, Phantom, Les Mis...

45:30.920 --> 45:32.320
We'll make a list. OK.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.040
We'll make a list.
Sounds good. It's a date.

45:35.320 --> 45:37.400
So, I'm just pureeing my apples.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.760
I grew up in County Armagh
in Northern Ireland,

45:39.760 --> 45:42.440
which is known as Orchard County
because of all the apple orchards.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.800
I'm going to freeze the apple puree
in straws

45:44.800 --> 45:47.240
and then I will braid around
the frozen puree.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.240
I hope it works. Fingers crossed.

45:50.560 --> 45:53.600
Mark's also taking a chance with
his flavours,

45:53.600 --> 45:58.000
combining his apple-filled trees
with hazelnut and wild garlic.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.520
Will Prue and Paul love apple
and wild garlic? I'm not sure.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.880
But I love it. I think it's such
an amazing taste

46:02.880 --> 46:05.200
So I'm going to put that in
for its first prove now.

46:05.200 --> 46:06.760
As more dough begins proving...

46:06.760 --> 46:08.560
Ready to go.

46:08.560 --> 46:12.000
..Hermine's brioche dough
is finally cold enough to shape.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.760
I'm twisting. I'm a bit pushed
for time.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.480
Cos I don't want the butter melting.

46:17.480 --> 46:20.880
But I think it will be fine
to go prove now.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.840
Just on time.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.440
Might be ready in time to bake.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.640
I hope so.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.920
SHE GASPS
Ah!

46:33.570 --> 46:36.450
90 minutes remain for the bakers to
complete their decorative

46:36.450 --> 46:37.890
bread plaques...

46:37.890 --> 46:39.490
This is such enormous fun.

46:39.490 --> 46:41.850
It's just a shame it's a
competition, really.

46:41.850 --> 46:45.770
..and their first batch of dough has
risen to the occasion.

46:45.770 --> 46:48.770
The focaccia has doubled in size.

46:48.770 --> 46:50.370
Good rise.

46:50.370 --> 46:52.610
And any additional ingredients...

46:53.890 --> 46:55.410
..can now be added.

46:55.410 --> 46:56.690
I need that.

46:56.690 --> 46:59.050
Hazelnuts going in, I want to
really make sure I get it in

46:59.050 --> 47:01.370
and just not on the top. It smells
amazing, doesn't it?

47:01.370 --> 47:02.490
Oh!

47:02.490 --> 47:04.490
I'm just putting in very mature
Somerset Cheddar

47:04.490 --> 47:05.930
and a Spanish chorizo.

47:05.930 --> 47:08.250
This is going to be an incorporated
dough.

47:08.250 --> 47:09.770
It's a tricky one to get right.

47:09.770 --> 47:12.090
I've warmed the pre-soaked pear.

47:12.090 --> 47:15.410
I didn't want it to cool the dough
and impede the rise.

47:15.410 --> 47:18.050
It doesn't want to go as flat as a
pancake and stodgy,

47:18.050 --> 47:20.770
which is another of my trademarks.

47:20.770 --> 47:23.290
This is the canvas for the
bread plaque.

47:23.290 --> 47:26.490
I'm just going to start
shaping it.

47:26.490 --> 47:28.730
Oh, that's stuck. Well done, Sura!

47:29.850 --> 47:33.090
Once her canvas is ready,
Sura's recreating one of her

47:33.090 --> 47:35.650
most cherished childhood memories,

47:35.650 --> 47:40.010
picking tomatoes off the vine her
mum grew in their London flat.

47:40.010 --> 47:41.490
It was huge.

47:41.490 --> 47:44.930
It was behind the TV in the living
room...like that.

47:44.930 --> 47:48.130
It was on the ceiling and so
whenever I see a tomato vine,

47:48.130 --> 47:49.770
I remember my mum.

47:49.770 --> 47:52.090
She's like my favourite
person on the Earth.

47:52.090 --> 47:53.810
Very thankful for her.

47:53.810 --> 47:56.410
Dave is also giving thanks
to his family...

47:56.410 --> 47:58.370
So, I'm making a bread plaque
of my house,

47:58.370 --> 48:00.330
with the family stood outside
the front.

48:00.330 --> 48:02.690
..which is soon getting a new
addition.

48:02.690 --> 48:05.570
Very excited about being a dad,
yeah, really looking forward to it.

48:05.570 --> 48:08.370
We're expecting a boy. Stacey says
I'm very laidback with kids.

48:08.370 --> 48:12.290
It will be baking, DIY, driving.

48:12.290 --> 48:13.610
HE CHUCKLES

48:13.610 --> 48:16.530
Dave's giving his Hampshire home
far flung flavours

48:16.530 --> 48:18.850
inspired by a holiday to Mexico.

48:18.850 --> 48:23.210
Woven hibiscus and guava bread will
sit under a mango, chilli roof.

48:23.210 --> 48:25.050
Are you doing like a shed?

48:25.050 --> 48:27.450
No shed that's in the back garden.
Garden shed? So from....

48:27.450 --> 48:29.810
What about a driveway?
No driveway, no.

48:29.810 --> 48:32.170
Garage? Recycling bins?
No.

48:32.170 --> 48:33.970
Anything else, Matt?
Decking outside?

48:33.970 --> 48:35.730
No decking, no.

48:35.730 --> 48:38.210
I just think cos it's 2020,
maybe some solar panels.

48:38.210 --> 48:40.770
But we don't have solar panels
on our house at the moment, so...

48:40.770 --> 48:43.090
You don't? No. I might get a solar
panel on my head,

48:43.090 --> 48:44.770
just to give me more energy.

48:44.770 --> 48:47.050
Over the long run, it'd be
cheaper than coffee.

48:48.930 --> 48:50.650
Dave's not the only baker...

48:50.650 --> 48:52.370
What part of my house is that?

48:52.370 --> 48:54.450
..grateful for their humble abode.

48:54.450 --> 48:57.170
I live with aunt and my uncle
and my two cousins.

48:57.170 --> 48:59.490
It's by the beach,
it's a lovely place to be,

48:59.490 --> 49:01.810
so I am making my house.

49:01.810 --> 49:04.850
Lottie's sun-dried tomato and
chorizo beach house

49:04.850 --> 49:08.330
will be surrounded by pesto palm
trees and bushes.

49:08.330 --> 49:11.410
I am doing this in a proving bag,
so that I can work on it

49:11.410 --> 49:13.490
whilst it's proving.

49:13.490 --> 49:16.130
But while Lottie and Dave are
finding it hard enough

49:16.130 --> 49:17.330
to build one house...

49:17.330 --> 49:19.250
It's not easy when you're
restricted.

49:19.250 --> 49:22.450
This makes it look like I'm
performing some bizarre operation.

49:22.450 --> 49:25.410
..Peter's taking on an entire city.

49:25.410 --> 49:27.770
I'm making an Edinburgh cityscape
bread plaque.

49:27.770 --> 49:30.130
I made these and did the drawing
myself.

49:30.130 --> 49:33.250
But he's got one more step before
construction can begin.

49:33.250 --> 49:36.210
I've chosen to make a bagel dough
because after you've boiled it,

49:36.210 --> 49:38.530
then it sets its shape and you're
actually able to get

49:38.530 --> 49:40.290
pretty precise cuts out of it.

49:40.290 --> 49:43.850
A seeded multigrain dough will form
the rocky backdrop

49:43.850 --> 49:46.490
to his poppy seed covered
Edinburgh landmarks.

49:46.490 --> 49:48.850
We did have a little practice on
bagels yesterday.

49:48.850 --> 49:51.170
I think I'm going to slightly change
how I do it,

49:51.170 --> 49:53.050
in response to their comments.

49:53.050 --> 49:55.490
I want to try and make it
slightly lighter.

49:55.490 --> 49:58.290
IN GERMAN ACCENT: Bakers, you have
one hour left.

49:58.290 --> 49:59.770
Ah, Matthew!

49:59.770 --> 50:01.770
THEY LAUGH

50:01.770 --> 50:04.090
God this time's disappearing
already, isn't it?

50:04.090 --> 50:06.090
Just have to crack on.

50:06.090 --> 50:08.650
This is the trunk of the tree.

50:08.650 --> 50:10.410
Bit concerned about Rowan.

50:10.410 --> 50:12.770
He seems confident that he'll get
this finished in the time

50:12.770 --> 50:14.410
but he is taking on a lot - again.

50:14.410 --> 50:16.010
Crack on with the decoration.

50:16.010 --> 50:17.890
I agree with you, there's such
a lot going on.

50:17.890 --> 50:20.210
I just hope to goodness he finishes.

50:20.210 --> 50:22.170
There is a plan -
I know that's surprising -

50:22.170 --> 50:24.490
and, so far, I think I'm going to
it.

50:24.490 --> 50:26.210
I'm not happy with the rise.

50:26.210 --> 50:27.890
It needs a bit more time.

50:27.890 --> 50:29.850
Hermine is doing brioche.

50:29.850 --> 50:32.210
Brioche in three and a half hours is
tricky to do. Yeah.

50:32.210 --> 50:34.570
So it's going to be interesting
to see, certainly with her

50:34.570 --> 50:36.410
French background, what she can come
up with.

50:36.410 --> 50:38.690
I'm going to carry on proving this.

50:38.690 --> 50:40.730
While Hermine's wait goes on...

50:40.730 --> 50:42.250
That's looking good.

50:42.250 --> 50:44.850
..the rest of the bakers' dough has
finished proving...

50:44.850 --> 50:47.490
I'm happy with my tiger bread,
that's come up lovely.

50:47.490 --> 50:49.010
Oh!

50:49.010 --> 50:51.810
..and their intricate designs can
now begin to take shape.

50:51.810 --> 50:54.130
So, here we go.

50:54.130 --> 50:57.810
The judges are expecting a variety
of bread shaping techniques.

50:57.810 --> 51:00.170
I've tried to show twists
and some plaits,

51:00.170 --> 51:02.530
but just hoping that my flavours
will make up for the fact

51:02.530 --> 51:05.010
that I'm not the most intricate of
bakers.

51:05.010 --> 51:06.930
This is just my frozen apple
puree.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.450
I'll push them out of the straws
and braid it over the top.

51:09.450 --> 51:12.090
Just want to sure I've got that
good definition in there.

51:12.090 --> 51:14.490
But the bakers need to work quickly.

51:14.490 --> 51:17.250
Your bread's going to continue to
prove, so you're not going to get

51:17.250 --> 51:20.410
anything defined enough if you
don't get your move on.

51:20.410 --> 51:23.170
I'm not very good at plaiting...

51:23.170 --> 51:25.050
..so it is a little bit tricky.

51:26.890 --> 51:29.450
It's not as good looking as the
other one.

51:29.450 --> 51:32.130
I'm really happy with the way that
that's come round, yeah.

51:32.130 --> 51:35.610
Hopefully, when it bakes, it won't
get too many pfft...

51:35.610 --> 51:37.450
..like a hernia.

51:37.450 --> 51:39.370
This is the canopy of the tree.

51:39.370 --> 51:41.850
It looks just like a bit of a
shambles at the moment

51:41.850 --> 51:45.370
but a few well-placed details can
bring a whole thing to life.

51:45.370 --> 51:46.970
The pears go on next.

51:46.970 --> 51:49.610
Does that look like a tractor?
Not quite, does it?!

51:49.610 --> 51:52.330
These are the tomatoes with
feta inside.

51:52.330 --> 51:54.650
This is the Forth rail bridge.

51:54.650 --> 51:57.010
I'm going to give it a red eggwash
before it goes in the oven.

51:57.010 --> 51:59.330
It comes out rusty red colour
that looks fairly similar

51:59.330 --> 52:00.410
to the real thing.

52:00.410 --> 52:02.010
The ties are going to be sprayed
gold.

52:02.010 --> 52:04.410
I think Paul's going to hate it
but he doesn't like glitter,

52:04.410 --> 52:07.610
he doesn't like the theatre, I mean,
pretty sad life if you ask me.

52:07.610 --> 52:10.890
Have you see Matt in Les Mis?
I did. He was amazing!

52:10.890 --> 52:12.930
I genuinely mean it when I say it
was the best thing

52:12.930 --> 52:14.930
I've ever seen in the West End.
Really?!

52:14.930 --> 52:16.890
I've seen it about five times.
Wow.

52:16.890 --> 52:18.490
It's quite a mess over here.
Look at it.

52:18.490 --> 52:20.890
I know! I think I'm the messy one
out of the group, to be fair.

52:20.890 --> 52:23.330
Wow, look at it. I'm all right with
that. I've got loads to do.

52:23.330 --> 52:25.850
Yeah, I know sorry. Bye-bye.
Love you!

52:25.850 --> 52:28.410
I have a wheel. This is starting to
come together now.

52:28.410 --> 52:30.770
This is my twist to go on the
outside.

52:30.770 --> 52:33.450
How far can I make that stretch?

52:33.450 --> 52:35.130
Oh, well that's sad.

52:35.130 --> 52:39.210
What about if I just do that?
No-one would ever know.

52:39.210 --> 52:41.690
This is a tiger glaze and I've tamed
it down so that it doesn't

52:41.690 --> 52:44.450
crack up too much.

52:44.450 --> 52:47.690
I'm painting it with spirulina and
then I've got some beetroot powder

52:47.690 --> 52:49.690
on the tomatoes.

52:49.690 --> 52:52.050
Stacey's pregnant and a furlough
belly for me.

52:52.050 --> 52:54.410
Hopefully, the dough will rise in
the right places.

52:54.410 --> 52:57.690
I am going in... For possibly
the last time.

52:57.690 --> 52:59.930
Please be good to me, little bread.

53:01.530 --> 53:04.090
Don't drop it, don't drop it,
don't drop it.

53:05.610 --> 53:08.210
I'm going to put it in for... 35.

53:08.210 --> 53:10.490
Yeah, in she goes!

53:10.490 --> 53:12.810
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

53:12.810 --> 53:15.490
I'm going to have about four minutes
to spare, I think.

53:15.490 --> 53:17.210
I'm having to rush these.

53:17.210 --> 53:20.290
I'm really out of time now and I
need to get this in the oven.

53:20.290 --> 53:22.730
IN AMERICAN ACCENT: Bakers, you
have half an hour left.

53:22.730 --> 53:23.930
Right, it's going in.

53:23.930 --> 53:26.450
That's 30 minutes.

53:26.450 --> 53:28.410
Oh, crumbs, right, I'm going in.

53:28.410 --> 53:30.690
Let's get on with some baking!

53:30.690 --> 53:31.970
HE SIGHS

53:31.970 --> 53:33.770
That was really close.

53:33.770 --> 53:36.690
It needs 30 minutes.
I've got exactly 30 minutes.

53:36.690 --> 53:40.210
My brioche, it hasn't proved
as well as I wanted.

53:41.770 --> 53:44.170
I'm going to give it
a bit more time.

53:44.170 --> 53:46.490
Oh, it feels like that's the
challenge over though.

53:46.490 --> 53:47.570
It's really weird.

53:47.570 --> 53:49.290
Have a little clean up now.

53:50.730 --> 53:52.450
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

53:54.370 --> 53:56.690
I take every opportunity that I can
just to try and take

53:56.690 --> 53:57.970
a mindful breath.

53:57.970 --> 54:00.330
Just like bring me back to the
present moment,

54:00.330 --> 54:02.330
cos when you think about it,
when we're worrying,

54:02.330 --> 54:04.890
we're worrying about things that
have happened in our past...

54:04.890 --> 54:07.250
Don't think I should've floured it,
to be honest.

54:07.250 --> 54:09.130
..or we're worrying
about the future.

54:09.130 --> 54:11.770
Have you got enough time to cook it?
I hope so.

54:11.770 --> 54:14.810
And, ultimately, we've got no
control over that, have we?

54:14.810 --> 54:17.130
But, of course, it's easier
said than done.

54:17.130 --> 54:18.650
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

54:18.650 --> 54:20.970
Paul Hollywood wants bread
and if he doesn't get it,

54:20.970 --> 54:22.690
he's going to be furious.

54:22.690 --> 54:25.410
You ain't baking,
you're going to be quaking!

54:25.410 --> 54:28.850
That should take about 15 minutes,
hopefully.

54:28.850 --> 54:30.770
It's going to be really close.

54:30.770 --> 54:32.330
SHE LAUGHS

54:32.330 --> 54:35.770
I'm just worried about the base,
so I think I might up it, you know.

54:35.770 --> 54:37.450
That's coming out now.

54:37.450 --> 54:39.330
# Ah, ah, ah-ah! #

54:39.330 --> 54:41.650
HE WHISTLES
Not bad!

54:41.650 --> 54:43.970
Hopefully, it's baked.

54:43.970 --> 54:46.370
That does sound hollow.
That sounds brilliant.

54:46.370 --> 54:47.930
We're good, we're good, we're good.

54:47.930 --> 54:49.410
Let's trim those bits off.

54:49.410 --> 54:51.290
There're an awful lot of leaves to
paint green,

54:51.290 --> 54:53.570
so I need to get busy with that.

54:53.570 --> 54:55.090
I'll give it a make-up job.

54:55.090 --> 54:57.330
Bakers, you have one minute left.

54:58.890 --> 55:00.410
I think it's cooked.

55:00.410 --> 55:02.730
Is it just us three in the ovens?
Just us three, yeah.

55:02.730 --> 55:04.330
Hmm, that's too big.

55:04.330 --> 55:06.250
Just take it carefully and slowly.

55:06.250 --> 55:08.090
So, there's a lot to trim.

55:08.090 --> 55:09.450
Going in!

55:09.450 --> 55:11.730
Urgh! Everyone's is out.

55:11.730 --> 55:14.170
This is my chilli oil.

55:14.170 --> 55:16.770
Bakers, your time is up.

55:18.170 --> 55:20.130
Please step away from your bread.

55:20.130 --> 55:22.170
DEEP SIGH

55:22.170 --> 55:24.530
I've done it.
Amazing.

55:24.530 --> 55:26.410
Well done, Hermine.
Oh!

55:28.810 --> 55:32.450
It'll probably taste appalling but
I'm quite pleased with the look.

55:32.450 --> 55:34.370
We'll go with it.

55:34.370 --> 55:36.610
Just hope I've done enough.

55:40.847 --> 55:44.847
It's judgement time for our bakers'
decorative bread plaques.

55:44.847 --> 55:47.567
Hermine, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper, please?

55:56.727 --> 55:57.927
Looks a bit abstract.

55:57.927 --> 55:59.927
You're driving through vineyards,
are you? Yes.

55:59.927 --> 56:01.367
So there's grapes. These?

56:01.367 --> 56:03.967
Um, that's supposed to be a farmer's
field and there's a tractor.

56:03.967 --> 56:05.607
Oh, that's a tractor. Yes.

56:05.607 --> 56:06.927
Oh, it's there, OK.

56:06.927 --> 56:10.127
You've lost a bit of definition
in the swirl on the outside,

56:10.127 --> 56:12.447
but, overall, it looks good.

56:12.447 --> 56:14.767
OK, well, let's have a look
at the frame to start with.

56:14.767 --> 56:16.167
This is the brioche.

56:16.167 --> 56:17.527
Yes.

56:17.527 --> 56:19.847
And then the main bit is
the focaccia.

56:19.847 --> 56:22.247
Yeah.

56:22.247 --> 56:24.607
The brioche doesn't hold
much flavour.

56:24.607 --> 56:26.567
I knew you were going to struggle to
get that out in time.

56:26.567 --> 56:29.047
It's an enriched dough,
but it's certainly not a brioche.

56:29.047 --> 56:31.327
Focaccia's lovely. Thank you.

56:31.327 --> 56:33.327
It's springy, I like both, actually.

56:33.327 --> 56:34.927
The focaccia's not bad.

56:34.927 --> 56:36.207
But I do like the design.

56:36.207 --> 56:38.047
It's very, very good. Thank you.

56:41.447 --> 56:42.927
I think it looks quite

56:42.927 --> 56:44.527
dramatic and effective.

56:44.527 --> 56:46.367
The plait on the outside's not bad.

56:46.367 --> 56:49.767
I like the effect you've got
by interlacing the two.

56:50.927 --> 56:52.207
Texture looks good.

56:53.847 --> 56:56.207
I think that is
beautifully seasoned.

56:56.207 --> 56:58.607
The tomato bread is nice as well -
it's got a nice zing to it.

56:58.607 --> 57:01.087
But, more importantly,
it's the structure,

57:01.087 --> 57:02.527
the air bubbles,

57:02.527 --> 57:04.327
it's regular
and it's even all the way down.

57:04.327 --> 57:05.847
It's a nice loaf. Thank you.

57:05.847 --> 57:07.407
Did you try one of the balls?

57:07.407 --> 57:09.807
They've got feta inside.

57:09.807 --> 57:11.287
Mm.

57:11.287 --> 57:13.647
That is delicious.

57:13.647 --> 57:16.287
Can I go? Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.

57:16.287 --> 57:17.527
Your agony is over.

57:17.527 --> 57:20.047
Well done, Sura. Well done.
Thank you.

57:22.407 --> 57:24.207
I love your Victorian swags

57:24.207 --> 57:26.487
of great velvet curtains,

57:26.487 --> 57:29.127
your gilded tassels are wonderful.

57:29.127 --> 57:30.687
It's simple but effective.

57:30.687 --> 57:32.527
Shall we have a look at it, then?
Yeah.

57:32.527 --> 57:36.847
It's a focaccia base with pancetta
and cheese.

57:39.527 --> 57:41.007
It's got quite a punch, hasn't it?

57:41.007 --> 57:42.607
Your ingredient choices are good.

57:42.607 --> 57:45.687
The problem is focaccia's a very,
very light dough

57:45.687 --> 57:47.647
and you put that on the top of it,

57:47.647 --> 57:49.567
so it couldn't rise,
so what it did is

57:49.567 --> 57:51.967
concertina back down again
and so it feels quite raw.

57:51.967 --> 57:53.287
It is a pity,

57:53.287 --> 57:55.607
because, when you get a bit of
the edge of the focaccia,

57:55.607 --> 57:56.567
it's really nice bread.

57:58.327 --> 58:00.647
The chilli bread's got a kick to it.

58:00.647 --> 58:02.967
Yeah, it's not bad at all.
I think it's full of flavour,

58:02.967 --> 58:04.407
but the textures weren't right.

58:08.207 --> 58:09.527
It's simple.

58:09.527 --> 58:11.207
It's sort of effective.

58:11.207 --> 58:13.807
I think you could've done more
with it, though.

58:17.247 --> 58:19.567
All your flavours are coming
from the seeds on the top,

58:19.567 --> 58:20.767
the dried herbs.

58:20.767 --> 58:23.127
They sort of carry through.
It's a nice eat, isn't it?

58:23.127 --> 58:26.367
It tastes very nice. I just feel
it's a little dense and tough.

58:26.367 --> 58:29.047
You made a bagel like a pitta.
It's a little weird.

58:29.047 --> 58:30.887
It is, isn't it?

58:30.887 --> 58:33.207
You shouldn't be able to do
that with bread.

58:33.207 --> 58:34.407
It's like a piece of leather.

58:35.487 --> 58:36.847
Oh, Peter...

58:40.607 --> 58:42.967
I think the design's
pretty good.

58:42.967 --> 58:46.207
You've kept some definition in there
as well, which is nice.

58:50.647 --> 58:52.407
That bread's beautifully risen.

58:52.407 --> 58:54.847
It feels great, but it lacks
flavour. OK.

58:54.847 --> 58:56.647
And this is tomato and paprika?

58:56.647 --> 58:59.047
That's, yeah, tomato,
paprika and chorizo.

58:59.047 --> 59:01.087
That packs a punch. That's nice.
Very nice.

59:01.087 --> 59:02.727
Nice balance of flavour
with it as well.

59:02.727 --> 59:05.487
That's a nice bread - you should've
done more with that... Very nice.

59:05.487 --> 59:06.727
..rather than the white.

59:10.407 --> 59:13.887
I like the concept,
I like the design, I love the cow.

59:13.887 --> 59:16.567
We drank milk straight from the cow
when we was children.

59:16.567 --> 59:18.847
From the udders? Not quite, Noel.

59:18.847 --> 59:21.127
Wow.

59:21.127 --> 59:22.767
Remind me of the flavour again?

59:22.767 --> 59:24.487
It's olive and tiger bread.

59:24.487 --> 59:26.367
But that's not the tiger
bread topping.

59:26.367 --> 59:28.807
It's the flavours of it
but not so much the cracking.

59:28.807 --> 59:29.807
OK.

59:31.167 --> 59:32.447
It's quite dense.

59:32.447 --> 59:35.167
More olives are needed,
more proving's needed,

59:35.167 --> 59:37.407
more flavour's needed.

59:40.487 --> 59:41.767
Interesting trees.

59:41.767 --> 59:43.727
Little bit bulky, compared with
the rest of it.

59:43.727 --> 59:45.407
I like the little bee.

59:45.407 --> 59:49.047
The plaiting's a little bit
irregular, thick and then thin.

59:54.167 --> 59:55.847
The structure's not bad,

59:55.847 --> 59:58.407
because, actually,
you do have a light crust

59:58.407 --> 1:00:00.727
and it is wetter on the mouth
which is what you want.

1:00:00.727 --> 1:00:02.207
Flavour's not that strong, though,

1:00:02.207 --> 1:00:03.887
considering you're using
wild garlic,

1:00:03.887 --> 1:00:06.247
you should be getting a serious kick
from that. Hm. Hm.

1:00:06.247 --> 1:00:07.967
This one's got apple
and cinnamon in it.

1:00:07.967 --> 1:00:10.007
Apple and cinnamon in the middle,
yeah, yeah.

1:00:10.007 --> 1:00:12.367
Hm, the apple
and cinnamon's really nice.

1:00:12.367 --> 1:00:14.967
It's a bit basic, the picture,
but the bread is OK.

1:00:18.527 --> 1:00:20.807
Well, it looks really surprising

1:00:20.807 --> 1:00:23.327
and pretty and quite neat.

1:00:23.327 --> 1:00:24.687
Certainly colourful.

1:00:24.687 --> 1:00:27.047
If you dig a little deeper
around the edges,

1:00:27.047 --> 1:00:28.687
it's a little bit weak on the
plaiting. Yes.

1:00:28.687 --> 1:00:31.047
It's slightly underproved
so it's ripped in the oven. OK.

1:00:31.047 --> 1:00:33.367
But this particular area here
is gorgeous. Thank you.

1:00:33.367 --> 1:00:36.087
Really nice, neat, clever.

1:00:36.087 --> 1:00:38.487
It's intricate detail, isn't it?
NOEL: Lovely colours.

1:00:38.487 --> 1:00:39.607
Ah, look.

1:00:39.607 --> 1:00:41.247
And that looks nice bread.

1:00:43.487 --> 1:00:44.967
The flavour of the brown's not bad.

1:00:44.967 --> 1:00:46.727
It could do with a little bit
more salt. OK.

1:00:46.727 --> 1:00:49.647
Fennel one, particularly, is nice.
But, overall, I like those flavours.

1:00:49.647 --> 1:00:50.727
Thank you very much.

1:00:50.727 --> 1:00:52.527
Marc, I think
you've done a really good job.

1:00:52.527 --> 1:00:55.767
It looks good, tastes good,
smells good, it is good.

1:00:55.767 --> 1:00:58.127
That's great. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

1:00:58.127 --> 1:01:01.047
Well done.
OK, thanks, thank you very much.

1:01:03.607 --> 1:01:04.847
Your wife's pregnant?

1:01:04.847 --> 1:01:07.727
Yes, yeah, although I do look more
pregnant than she does.

1:01:07.727 --> 1:01:09.167
I was going to say.

1:01:09.167 --> 1:01:11.487
It's called sympathetic pregnancy.

1:01:11.487 --> 1:01:13.807
I would've spent time
cutting bricks out

1:01:13.807 --> 1:01:14.847
and placed them on,

1:01:14.847 --> 1:01:17.207
and just built up
that brickwork look.

1:01:17.207 --> 1:01:20.607
I mean, you sort of get it, but it
would look nice with that. OK.

1:01:20.607 --> 1:01:22.287
This is the one with mango.

1:01:22.287 --> 1:01:24.687
Mango, lime and chilli paste
running through.

1:01:24.687 --> 1:01:27.047
Well, you certainly get the mango
and the chilli.

1:01:27.047 --> 1:01:29.407
I like the flavour. I've never had
anything quite like that.

1:01:29.407 --> 1:01:31.167
But I just think the bread's
a little bit too dry,

1:01:31.167 --> 1:01:32.167
it's overbaked. OK.

1:01:33.247 --> 1:01:35.247
And the flavour of the base?

1:01:35.247 --> 1:01:37.567
That is hibiscus
and guava flavour drops.

1:01:37.567 --> 1:01:40.167
I've never met guava flavour.

1:01:40.167 --> 1:01:41.927
NOEL: Never had an Um Bongo, Prue?

1:01:41.927 --> 1:01:43.607
MATT: You've never been to the
Congo.

1:01:43.607 --> 1:01:46.207
Oh, no, I know guavas well, but I've
never known it as an essence.

1:01:46.207 --> 1:01:48.527
Right. And I can't really taste it.

1:01:48.527 --> 1:01:49.927
But the ideas are unique.

1:01:49.927 --> 1:01:51.607
I've never tried either of them
before.

1:01:51.607 --> 1:01:53.647
It's just that the baking was
a little bit too far.

1:01:53.647 --> 1:01:55.927
Yeah, all right, fair enough.
Thank you.

1:01:58.407 --> 1:02:00.727
NOEL: You need a hand, right?
I do, please.

1:02:00.727 --> 1:02:02.447
Let's do this.

1:02:02.447 --> 1:02:04.167
Is that going to fit?

1:02:04.167 --> 1:02:05.607
Let's hope.

1:02:07.887 --> 1:02:09.727
Well, Rowan...

1:02:09.727 --> 1:02:12.407
Overall, I think it looks great.
I think it looks quite attractive.

1:02:12.407 --> 1:02:14.847
Very big. What's the bread there?

1:02:14.847 --> 1:02:19.167
Worcestershire blue cheese
and pears soaked in local cider.

1:02:23.047 --> 1:02:24.207
Get the cider.

1:02:25.527 --> 1:02:28.167
And where's the blue cheese?
Well, I pressed it in.

1:02:28.167 --> 1:02:31.807
You pressed it in, OK, that's why
we're not getting the taste. Right.

1:02:31.807 --> 1:02:34.167
And, actually, I would've mixed
it in the dough

1:02:34.167 --> 1:02:35.847
and you needed much more
proving in that.

1:02:35.847 --> 1:02:38.487
Keeping these restrained to keep
the look,

1:02:38.487 --> 1:02:40.847
you've gone for all style
and no substance.

1:02:40.847 --> 1:02:43.207
You've ended up with a bread
which is actually quite bland.

1:02:43.207 --> 1:02:45.527
Right. What's the flavour of that
one?

1:02:45.527 --> 1:02:46.887
That is chestnut and walnut.

1:02:49.287 --> 1:02:51.687
Again, walnuts, a lot more.

1:02:51.687 --> 1:02:55.127
It's such a pity cos
that's a much nicer bread.

1:02:55.127 --> 1:02:56.967
Shall we try the earthy one?

1:02:56.967 --> 1:02:58.567
I can smell the truffle.

1:02:58.567 --> 1:03:01.247
It definitely has more flavour,
but it could do with some salt.

1:03:01.247 --> 1:03:03.287
OK. Thank you very much.

1:03:03.287 --> 1:03:04.687
Many thanks.

1:03:06.327 --> 1:03:08.647
All style, no substance - that's me.

1:03:08.647 --> 1:03:11.087
I'd rather be all style,
no substance, anyway.

1:03:12.567 --> 1:03:15.807
Somewhat disappointed, I was very
happy with the look of it,

1:03:15.807 --> 1:03:18.687
and, so, I'm glad to have done
what I could do.

1:03:18.687 --> 1:03:20.327
Feeling a little uneasy.

1:03:20.327 --> 1:03:22.687
I might be home tomorrow,
but I haven't phoned her yet.

1:03:22.687 --> 1:03:25.007
Oh, it'd mean a lot to be
able to come back next week.

1:03:25.007 --> 1:03:26.367
That went better than expected.

1:03:26.367 --> 1:03:28.207
Usually, I hear these things
from my parents

1:03:28.207 --> 1:03:30.207
and I just thought,
"It's cos you're my parents."

1:03:30.207 --> 1:03:31.847
But it's nice to hear it from them.

1:03:31.847 --> 1:03:33.727
Really happy with that,
really happy.

1:03:33.727 --> 1:03:35.687
Oh, it'd feel amazing, I think,

1:03:35.687 --> 1:03:38.047
if they called out that
I was star baker for the week.

1:03:38.047 --> 1:03:40.567
Uh, but, yeah,
I don't know how I'd handle it.

1:03:45.814 --> 1:03:48.174
So how do you think that went?
I think overall,

1:03:48.174 --> 1:03:50.574
the standard wasn't particularly
good. I think they feel

1:03:50.574 --> 1:03:52.454
a lot of pressure on Bread Week
to impress you,

1:03:52.454 --> 1:03:53.814
and often, they implode.

1:03:53.814 --> 1:03:55.614
They needed to come in strong,
didn't they?

1:03:55.614 --> 1:03:58.094
If you're not confident,
it'll always show.

1:03:58.094 --> 1:04:01.094
Sura and Marc E, those two
had terrific confidence

1:04:01.094 --> 1:04:04.254
and they're bang in your face.

1:04:04.254 --> 1:04:06.134
They both managed to get the right
texture,

1:04:06.134 --> 1:04:07.694
the right flavour, the right look.

1:04:07.694 --> 1:04:11.174
So star baker, Marc E and Sura.
Yeah.

1:04:11.174 --> 1:04:13.494
What about Hermine? She had a
handshake yesterday.

1:04:13.494 --> 1:04:14.494
Hermine has a possibility.

1:04:14.494 --> 1:04:16.174
Didn't do brilliant
in the technical.

1:04:16.174 --> 1:04:18.614
And her showstopper,
I didn't like the enriched dough.

1:04:18.614 --> 1:04:20.094
Who do you think is down the
bottom?

1:04:20.094 --> 1:04:21.614
Obviously, Rowan is. Anyone else?

1:04:21.614 --> 1:04:24.934
I think Peter's in trouble I also
think David's in trouble as well.

1:04:24.934 --> 1:04:26.894
Our two previous star bakers. Yeah.

1:04:26.894 --> 1:04:28.254
In defence of Rowan,

1:04:28.254 --> 1:04:32.214
his showstopper really looked like a
showstopper, didn't it? It did.

1:04:32.214 --> 1:04:34.574
Again, style and substance.
It lacked flavour.

1:04:34.574 --> 1:04:36.854
But how much flavour
do breads really need?

1:04:37.894 --> 1:04:40.214
You've crossed the line.
I've crossed the line.

1:04:40.214 --> 1:04:41.854
Do you want a fight, Matt?

1:04:52.414 --> 1:04:56.854
So bakers, congratulations. I know
it's been a long couple of days.

1:04:56.854 --> 1:04:59.454
One of you is star baker,

1:04:59.454 --> 1:05:01.814
and that person is...

1:05:03.254 --> 1:05:04.334
Marc E.

1:05:10.934 --> 1:05:14.094
Oh, bakers, that means I've got
the horrible job

1:05:14.094 --> 1:05:15.774
of sending someone home.

1:05:16.094 --> 1:05:22.054
The person who is leaving us is...

1:05:30.174 --> 1:05:31.494
Rowan.

1:05:31.494 --> 1:05:33.734
Oh! That's fine.

1:05:35.134 --> 1:05:37.454
These boots were made for walking.

1:05:37.454 --> 1:05:40.934
I feel very content, really.
I've had a wonderful time.

1:05:41.174 --> 1:05:43.934
Um, it is exhausting,
but very rewarding.

1:05:43.934 --> 1:05:48.014
Bring it in, bring it in, kids.
Sorry, Rowan.

1:05:48.014 --> 1:05:50.454
And I was also quite pleased
that Noel said to me,

1:05:50.454 --> 1:05:52.894
"Well, I'm all style
and no substance".

1:05:52.894 --> 1:05:55.334
He said, "It's on my CV!"

1:05:55.334 --> 1:05:57.894
I'm going to miss those laughs. Oh.

1:05:57.894 --> 1:06:00.214
Rowan has been such a character.

1:06:00.214 --> 1:06:03.174
I'm sorry to see him go
because he is so ambitious

1:06:03.174 --> 1:06:07.494
and so imaginative and he puts
so much thought into this baking.

1:06:08.334 --> 1:06:12.694
He delivered a showstopper which
was very impressive to look at,

1:06:12.694 --> 1:06:14.574
but it just didn't taste good.

1:06:14.574 --> 1:06:16.854
Going to miss you, Rowan.

1:06:16.854 --> 1:06:17.854
Such mixed emotions.

1:06:17.854 --> 1:06:21.494
Sad for Rowan, ecstatic for Marc
because he really deserved

1:06:21.494 --> 1:06:23.334
and needed that for his confidence.

1:06:23.334 --> 1:06:25.814
I just got star baker, didn't I?
On Bread Week.

1:06:25.814 --> 1:06:28.174
It's the thing that I enjoy making,

1:06:28.174 --> 1:06:31.414
it's the thing that started me
on this whole baking experience.

1:06:31.414 --> 1:06:33.694
To get star baker, that is amazing.

1:06:33.694 --> 1:06:34.934
Well done, Marc. Thank you.

1:06:34.934 --> 1:06:36.694
It was good, it was really good.

1:06:36.694 --> 1:06:39.294
Marc E did really
well in the signature,

1:06:39.294 --> 1:06:41.654
pretty well in the technical as well

1:06:41.654 --> 1:06:43.014
and in the showstopper,

1:06:43.014 --> 1:06:45.854
he managed to get his dough risen
and tasting good,

1:06:45.854 --> 1:06:48.934
so the whole Buddhist ethos
really worked for him.

1:06:48.934 --> 1:06:51.334
Hey! Well done for getting star
baker.

1:06:51.334 --> 1:06:53.254
Thank you very much.

1:06:53.254 --> 1:06:54.774
Hey, Gibbygibs.
Thank you, girls.

1:06:54.774 --> 1:06:57.494
Love you. I love you too.
You're the best. Thank you.

1:06:59.494 --> 1:07:02.174
Oh, you've made me
get all emotional now.

1:07:05.534 --> 1:07:08.534
Next time... Oh, my God.
It's Chocolate Week. Sweet.

1:07:08.534 --> 1:07:10.454
And there's tension in the tent...
Oh, come on.

1:07:10.454 --> 1:07:12.854
..as the bakers face a
nerve-wracking signature.

1:07:12.854 --> 1:07:14.414
Don't drop, don't drop, don't drop.

1:07:14.414 --> 1:07:16.774
It's a waiting game as they prove
themselves...

1:07:16.774 --> 1:07:19.294
High five. There you go.
..In a tough technical.

1:07:19.294 --> 1:07:21.614
Never heard of one.
I wish I knew what it looked like.

1:07:21.614 --> 1:07:23.934
And the temperature rises...

1:07:23.934 --> 1:07:26.254
It's starting to really heat
up in here now.

1:07:26.254 --> 1:07:27.574
..with a triple-tiered showstopper

1:07:27.574 --> 1:07:29.934
which will lead to one of the bakers
coming off the tracks.

1:07:29.934 --> 1:07:31.334
We're getting hammered.

1:07:31.334 --> 1:07:33.014
Ruthless.

1:07:48.614 --> 1:07:54.374
