WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:04.100
- BUT YOU TWO PEOPLE KNOW
DEEP DOWN

00:04.100 --> 00:05.867
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,

00:05.867 --> 00:10.000
HOW YOU CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER,
AND HOW MUCH--

00:10.000 --> 00:13.100
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.067
- WELL, MARIE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING,

00:24.067 --> 00:25.567
COMING OVER HERE,

00:25.567 --> 00:28.200
BECAUSE THIS PAST MONTH
OF YOU NOT TALKING TO ME

00:28.200 --> 00:31.133
HAS BEEN THE BEST MONTH
OF MY LIFE!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.567
- OH...

00:47.367 --> 00:49.000
- OH.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.500
MAN, I LOVE A PICKLE.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.333
JUICY.

00:56.333 --> 00:59.167
MMM. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT A PICKLE?

00:59.167 --> 01:01.767
IT'S LIKE A FOOD
AND A DRINK.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.367
MMM.

01:15.233 --> 01:18.033
- THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT?

01:18.033 --> 01:19.900
IT'S CRISP.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.167
YOU KNOW, I REALLY NEVER KNEW
WHAT PEOPLE MEANT

01:22.167 --> 01:23.933
WHEN THEY SAID
IT WAS A CRISP DAY,

01:23.933 --> 01:27.900
BUT TODAY I GET IT.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.733
- WHERE'D YOU GET THAT SHIRT?
BIG, TALL, AND SAMOAN?

01:37.767 --> 01:39.800
GO AWAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.400
- I HUGGED YA.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.933
SURPRISED? THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I HUGGED YA.

01:43.933 --> 01:47.367
OH, THERE'S A NEW ROBERT
IN TOWN.

01:47.367 --> 01:51.133
- WELL, HE STILL HAS
THAT OLD ROBERT SMELL.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.100
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON, ROBERT?

01:54.100 --> 01:55.233
- AH, I'M JUST HAPPY.

01:55.233 --> 01:57.200
I GOT A NEW OUTLOOK ON LIFE.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.833
HEY, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
ABOUT INNERPATH?

02:01.833 --> 02:02.867
- NO. WHAT'S THAT?

02:02.867 --> 02:04.500
- OH, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.000
IT'S A GROUP
WITH A GREAT PHILOSOPHY

02:07.000 --> 02:08.567
ABOUT LIFE AND HOW TO LIVE IT.

02:08.567 --> 02:09.967
I'VE BEEN TO A COUPLE MEETINGS
ALREADY.

02:09.967 --> 02:12.033
GERARD GOT ME INTO IT.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.100
- GERARD?

02:14.100 --> 02:16.433
ISN'T HE, LIKE, UH...

02:16.433 --> 02:18.267
AN IDIOT?

02:20.300 --> 02:22.733
- I USED TO THINK SO.

02:22.733 --> 02:25.133
BUT THAT WAS MY BAGGAGE

02:25.133 --> 02:29.433
I WAS MAKING HIM CARRY.

02:29.433 --> 02:31.600
- OH.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.967
SO IS THIS LIKE
A SELF-HELP GROUP OR SOMETHING?

02:37.967 --> 02:39.467
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S MUCH MORE.

02:39.467 --> 02:41.133
YOU SEE,
INNERPATH TEACHES US

02:41.133 --> 02:43.533
THAT WE ALL HAVE
THE SAME EMOTIONAL DOORS,

02:43.533 --> 02:47.500
AND THE TRICK IS RECOGNIZING
WHICH DOORS TO BOLT SHUT

03:04.767 --> 03:06.467
- ROBERT, SIT DOWN.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.500
[sighs]

03:08.500 --> 03:10.800
LISTEN, HAVE THESE PEOPLE
ASKED YOU FOR MONEY?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.033
- NO, NO, NO.

03:12.033 --> 03:15.233
I GAVE THEM SOME
BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.700
- COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:16.700 --> 03:19.433
IT'S LIKE A SCAM
OR SOMETHING.

03:19.433 --> 03:23.000
- HAPPINESS IS NOT A SCAM,
RAYMOND.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.600
HEY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.200
WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO A MEETING WITH ME?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.567
YOU COULD LEARN
A THING OR TWO.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.467
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS? NO.

03:29.467 --> 03:33.633
- UH, THEY SAID I WOULD
ENCOUNTER NAYSAY NEGATIVITY.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.867
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT INNERPATH TAUGHT ME?

03:35.867 --> 03:37.433
LIKE A CAMERA,

03:37.433 --> 03:41.600
I USE NEGATIVES TO DEVELOP.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.000
- WHY DON'T YOU ADD
A GRASS SKIRT TO THAT OUTFIT

03:55.000 --> 03:58.467
AND DANCE AROUND A VOLCANO?

03:58.467 --> 04:00.967
- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:00.967 --> 04:02.300
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
ROBERT?

04:02.300 --> 04:03.767
I'M GONNA GO
ACROSS THE STREET.

04:03.767 --> 04:07.233
I WANT TO SHARE THE PATH
WITH MOM AND DAD.

04:07.233 --> 04:09.667
- OH, MY GOD!
HE'S IN A CULT!

04:13.133 --> 04:15.367
- IT'S NOT A CULT, MA.

04:15.367 --> 04:18.100
- THEN WHY THE HELL
DID YOU HUG ME?

04:21.033 --> 04:22.533
- IT MADE ME HAPPY.

04:22.533 --> 04:26.033
- OH, MY GOD!
HE'S IN A CULT!

04:26.033 --> 04:27.133
- IT'S NOT A CULT.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.733
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

04:28.733 --> 04:31.567
WHO WANT TO SEE ME HAPPY,
WHO HAPPEN TO CARE ABOUT ME.

04:31.567 --> 04:34.433
- YOU HAVE THAT HERE,
YOU STUPID ASS.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.100
- WELL, THEY SAID
YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.233
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE.

04:46.233 --> 04:49.267
- BACK! GET BACK!

04:49.267 --> 04:50.400
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO UP

04:50.400 --> 04:51.967
AND TRY TO FIND
SOME OLD PHOTOS.

04:51.967 --> 04:57.000
INNERPATH WANTS TO DO A COLLAGE
OF OUR FORMER SELVES.

04:58.033 --> 04:59.433
- LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.933
YOU NEVER HUGGED HIM ENOUGH
AS A CHILD.

05:01.933 --> 05:03.367
NOW HE'S GONNA SHAVE HIS HEAD

05:03.367 --> 05:06.133
AND SIT ON THE FLOOR
AT THE AIRPORT.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.067
- HEY.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.667
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN--
WAS ROBERT HERE?

05:16.667 --> 05:19.300
- YEAH, IT WAS HORRIBLE.
HE HUGGED ME.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.700
- HE HUGGED ME TOO.
HE'S HUGGIN' EVERYTHING.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.100
- ALL RIGHT,
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.533
ROBERT IS SO IMPRESSIONABLE.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.100
- YEAH, HE'S A DOPE.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

05:28.100 --> 05:30.300
- WE HAVE TO GET HIM
OUT OF THIS.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.667
RAYMOND, YOU HAVE TO
TALK TO HIM.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.367
- YOU KNOW, RAY,

05:39.367 --> 05:41.500
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND OUT MORE
ABOUT THIS INNERPATH, RAY.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.333
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE ROBERT UP
ON HIS OFFER.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.200
- NO, I COULDN'T.
- WHAT OFFER?

05:45.200 --> 05:47.500
- HE ASKED ME TO GO
TO A MEETING WITH HIM.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.933
- YOU HAVE TO DO THAT,
RAYMOND.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.733
THESE PEOPLE
SOUND LIKE MANIACS.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.233
- NO!

05:56.233 --> 05:57.833
NO, NO, I'M NOT!

05:57.833 --> 06:00.467
LOOK, COME ON. I'M NOT GOING
TO ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

06:00.467 --> 06:04.633
WHAT IF THEY DRUG ME
AND I WAKE UP CHAINED TO A GOAT?

06:06.333 --> 06:09.533
- YOU JUST DESCRIBED
MY WEDDING.

06:17.133 --> 06:20.033
- I HEARD THAT.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.167
- HEY, BROTHER, MAN.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.367
- HEY, HEY.
OKAY, OKAY.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.333
DON'T HUG ME.
LISTEN, LISTEN.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.033
I'M GOING TO GO TO ONE OF
THOSE MEETINGS WITH YOU.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.333
- THAT'S NICE.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.500
THAT'S A FAMILY.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.100
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LET'S GET STARTED.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.267
- NO CHAIRS?

06:49.267 --> 06:50.867
- WELL, IF YOU'RE SITTING
IN A CHAIR,

06:50.867 --> 06:53.233
YOU CAN'T BE DOWN TO EARTH.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.667
- HEY, RAY.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.633
- HEY, GERARD.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.667
- OKAY, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

07:02.667 --> 07:06.467
GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY:
EVERYBODY TURN TO THE LEFT.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.300
[patting loudly]

07:09.833 --> 07:11.733
DON'T FORGET THE RIGHT.

07:15.633 --> 07:16.667
SUPER.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.833
NOW, I'M LOOKING
AROUND THE ROOM,

07:18.833 --> 07:20.967
AND I SEE A NEW FACE,

07:20.967 --> 07:23.200
A HAPPY FACE,

07:23.200 --> 07:26.433
A FACE I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.533
- THIS IS MY BROTHER,
RAYMOND.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.433
- WELCOME TO THE PATH,
RAYMOND.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.000
all: RAYMOND! RAYMOND!
RAYMOND! RAYMOND!

07:36.000 --> 07:37.633
RAYMOND! RAYMOND!
RAYMOND! RAYMOND!

07:37.633 --> 07:39.667
WHOO!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.367
- HEY.

07:46.367 --> 07:48.500
- RAYMOND, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL EVERYBODY

07:48.500 --> 07:50.267
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOURSELF?

07:50.267 --> 07:52.300
- YOU SAID THAT
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK.

07:52.300 --> 07:55.333
- RAYMOND HAS A WIFE
AND THREE CHILDREN,

07:55.333 --> 07:58.133
AND HE IS ALSO
THE WRITER FOR "NEWSDAY."

07:58.133 --> 08:00.033
- WE ALL KNOW
WHO HE IS, ROBERT.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.333
[all laughing]

08:04.033 --> 08:05.933
- YOU DO?

08:05.933 --> 08:08.667
- GERARD DID MENTION
THAT HE WAS RAY'S COUSIN,

08:08.667 --> 08:10.300
AND, GOSH, RAY,

08:10.300 --> 08:13.033
WE ARE JUST SO SUPER HONORED
TO HAVE YOU WITH US,

08:13.033 --> 08:15.833
A FAMOUS NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.400
all: RAYMOND! RAYMOND!
RAYMOND! RAYMOND!

08:17.400 --> 08:18.800
RAYMOND! RAYMOND!
RAYMOND! RAYMOND!

08:18.800 --> 08:21.433
WHOO!

08:21.433 --> 08:25.800
- THAT REALLY GETS YOU GOING,
HUH?

08:25.800 --> 08:29.367
- OUR LEADER LIKES TO BRING
NOTABLES INTO THE FOLD

08:29.367 --> 08:32.567
SO THAT WE CAN BETTER EXPLAIN
OUR MISSION TO THE WORLD.

08:32.567 --> 08:35.267
AND YOU, RAY BARONE,
ARE A NOTABLE.

08:35.267 --> 08:37.567
- [chuckles]
TELL THAT TO MY WIFE.

08:37.567 --> 08:38.900
[people chuckle]

08:38.900 --> 08:40.500
- [laughs loudly]

08:40.500 --> 08:43.433
[laughter]

08:46.200 --> 08:48.467
- UH, E-E-EXCUSE ME.

08:48.467 --> 08:53.067
SO YOU USED ME TO GET TO RAY?

08:53.067 --> 08:54.800
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT USED,

08:54.800 --> 08:57.067
MORE LIKE...

09:01.833 --> 09:04.333
- IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU
WITH US TOO, ROBERT.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.433
ROBERT!

09:05.433 --> 09:08.533
[chanting weakly]
ROBERT! ROBERT! ROBERT!

09:15.367 --> 09:17.500
[chatting indistinctly]

09:25.867 --> 09:29.733
- OKAY. OKAY.
OKAY, BYE-BYE.

09:33.667 --> 09:38.767
- WELL, I, FOR ONE,
AM SOMEWHAT DISILLUSIONED.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.433
- WHY, BECAUSE THEY LIKE ME?

09:40.433 --> 09:43.533
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
CREEPY SMILING AND THE TOUCHING?

09:43.533 --> 09:47.300
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.600
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.033
LOOK AT THESE NUT JOBS--
BYE! BYE!

09:52.033 --> 09:53.667
OKAY.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.433
GOOD-BYE.

09:56.367 --> 09:58.667
COME ON,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

09:58.667 --> 10:01.500
- I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
SO GREAT LATELY.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.167
I--I FEEL LIKE
I GOT NOTHING TO...

10:04.167 --> 10:06.000
COUNT ON.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.200
AND NOW THIS THING
WITH MA AND DEBRA,

10:08.200 --> 10:11.800
IT'S GOT ME--

10:11.800 --> 10:13.533
I DON'T KNOW.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.933
- I'LL TELL YOU, THOUGH,

10:27.933 --> 10:29.900
WHEN YOU TOLD US
ABOUT INNERPATH,

10:29.900 --> 10:31.433
IT ACTUALLY GOT BOTH OF THEM

10:31.433 --> 10:32.933
IN THE SAME ROOM
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

10:32.933 --> 10:35.033
'CAUSE THEY WERE
SO FREAKED OUT.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.967
- REALLY? THEY WERE
WORRIED ABOUT ME?

10:36.967 --> 10:39.333
- YEAH! YEAH!

10:39.333 --> 10:43.633
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:43.633 --> 10:46.467
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
WE COULD DO.

10:49.133 --> 10:50.600
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:50.600 --> 10:53.267
- MAN, WASN'T THAT
A GREAT MEETING, RAYMOND?

10:53.267 --> 10:56.500
I AM ON CLOUD NINE.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.333
CAN YOU GUYS GIVE ME
A LIFT HOME?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.600
SOMEBODY STOLE MY CAR.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.900
- HEY, THAT WAS--

11:09.900 --> 11:12.500
- [sighs]

11:13.800 --> 11:16.167
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:16.167 --> 11:18.500
- IT'S BAD!

11:18.500 --> 11:20.100
- WHAT? WHAT'S BAD?
- THEY'RE FREAKS!

11:20.100 --> 11:21.900
THEY'RE FREAKIN'
MIND-MELDING FREAKS!

11:21.900 --> 11:24.000
AND THEY GOT ROBERT!

11:24.000 --> 11:25.667
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THEY GOT ROBERT?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.967
- THEY'RE IN HIS HEAD.
DON'T YOU GE TIT?

11:27.967 --> 11:30.033
THIS WAS MY BROTHER!

11:30.033 --> 11:31.833
- HONEY, IT'S OKAY--

11:31.833 --> 11:35.100
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY, DEBRA!
IT'S NOT, NOT THIS TIME!

11:36.500 --> 11:38.600
NOT THIS TIME.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.633
I SAW THEM!
I SAW THEM!

11:41.633 --> 11:43.400
THEY GOT ROBERT
SO TURNED AROUND,

11:43.400 --> 11:46.033
HE DOESN'T EVEN WEAR
UNDERPANTS ANYMORE.

11:46.033 --> 11:47.400
- WHAT?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.733
- THEY DON'T WEAR UNDERPANTS,
DEBRA!

11:48.733 --> 11:51.200
THEY'RE FREAKS!

11:51.200 --> 11:53.333
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW!

11:53.333 --> 11:54.767
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.400
I CALLED THE PRECINCT
TO TALK TO HIS PARTNER.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.700
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO?

11:57.700 --> 11:59.300
SHE WANTS TO COME OVER

11:59.300 --> 12:00.733
AND HAVE ONE OF THOSE
INSURRECTIONS OR SOMETHIN'.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.500
- AN INTERVENTION?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

12:02.500 --> 12:04.267
JUDY SAID SHE HAS EXPERIENCE
IN THAT THING.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.300
BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK,
DOES IT?

12:06.300 --> 12:07.967
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW--
[knocking]

12:07.967 --> 12:09.800
- JUDY, WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.100
- I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK

12:11.100 --> 12:12.700
AN INTERVENTION CAN HELP
YOUR BROTHER, RAY,

12:12.700 --> 12:14.333
BUT HE'S MY PARTNER,
AND I SURE AS HELL AM GONNA TRY.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.733
THAT OKAY WITH YOU, DEBRA?

12:15.733 --> 12:18.167
- UH, YEAH, I GUESS,
IF YOU REALLY THINK--

12:18.167 --> 12:19.833
- GOOD.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

12:19.833 --> 12:24.033
WE LOCK THE DOOR ON THE SUCKER
AND LOVE-BOMB HIS SORRY ASS.

12:24.033 --> 12:25.800
- WELL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET--

12:25.800 --> 12:28.767
- I TOLD ROBERT YOU WANTED HIM
HERE AT 9:00 FOR CAKE.

12:28.767 --> 12:29.933
- HE FELL FOR THAT?

12:29.933 --> 12:32.200
- THAT BOY ALWAYS FALLS
FOR CAKE.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.667
HURRY UP!
IT'S ALMOST 9:00!

12:39.500 --> 12:40.933
- HI, MA.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.200
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.667
I'M HERE FOR ROBBIE.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.767
HELLO, JUDY, DEAR.
- YEAH, YEAH.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.200
NOW LISTEN UP, PEOPLE.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.300
YOU JUST DO WHAT I SAY,
AND WE'LL BE FINE.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.667
AND NO MATTER WHAT,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH

12:52.667 --> 12:55.167
ROBERT WANTS TO GET OUT
OF HERE--AND HE WILL--

12:55.167 --> 12:57.033
WE DO NOT LET HIM.

12:57.033 --> 12:58.367
WE STAY HERE AS LONG IT TAKES

12:58.367 --> 13:00.367
TO LET ROBERT KNOW
THAT YOU ARE HIS FAMILY

13:00.367 --> 13:02.533
AND THAT FAMILY,
THAT LOVE, IS STRONGER

13:02.533 --> 13:04.667
THAN ANY CRAZY-FACED
LOSER COLLECTION OF PINHEADS.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.367
WHERE'S FRANK?

13:07.367 --> 13:09.467
- HE'S AT THE LODGE,
WHICH IS FOR THE BEST.

13:09.467 --> 13:13.300
HE'S NOT REALLY GOOD WITH LOVE.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.300
- ALL RIGHT.
SEE YA, FELLAS.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.467
HELLO...

13:22.467 --> 13:23.967
EVERYBODY.

13:23.967 --> 13:25.767
WHAT'S UP?

13:28.367 --> 13:30.900
MA.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.167
WHY ARE YOU HERE WITH DEBRA?

13:33.167 --> 13:35.033
- I'M NOT HERE WITH ANYONE,
DEAR.

13:35.033 --> 13:37.400
I'M HERE BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.067
- OH, MY GOD!

13:40.067 --> 13:41.133
- DON'T LET HIM OUT!

13:41.133 --> 13:43.767
[all shouting]

13:43.767 --> 13:44.833
- DON'T MAKE THIS HARD--

13:44.833 --> 13:46.500
[yelling]

13:47.933 --> 13:50.233
- [yelling]

13:54.800 --> 13:56.267
SIT DOWN!

13:56.267 --> 13:59.300
- ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

14:07.200 --> 14:09.533
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

14:09.533 --> 14:12.300
AND YOU CAN ALL TALK
UNTIL YOU'RE BLUE IN THE FACE,

14:12.300 --> 14:15.667
BUT IT WILL NOT DO YOU ANY GOOD.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.400
"THE PATH IS STRAIGHT,

14:17.400 --> 14:19.367
"AND THE CHILDREN OF THE PATH

14:19.367 --> 14:23.067
"SHALL WALK UPON IT

14:23.067 --> 14:27.633
STRAIGHTLY
ON ITS STRAIGHTY STRAIGHTNESS."

14:27.633 --> 14:29.600
- YOU SEE?
YOU SEE?

14:29.600 --> 14:32.333
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S WORSE NOW.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.867
- WHAT DID THEY DO TO HIM?
WHY IS HE SMILING LIKE THAT?

14:34.867 --> 14:37.567
- [whispering]
NO UNDERPANTS.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.167
- ROBERT,
YOU CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE--

14:48.167 --> 14:50.300
- LET ME.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.867
HEY, PARTNER, REMEMBER ME?

14:53.867 --> 14:55.167
- YES, JUDY.

14:55.167 --> 14:56.933
I WORKED WITH YOU
ON THE FORCE.

14:56.933 --> 15:00.233
BUT I'VE GIVEN UP THAT LIFE
TO BECOME A FULL-TIME PATHIST.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.200
I'VE ALMOST GOT THE GREEN SHIRT.

15:06.267 --> 15:07.900
- THIS IS BAD.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.433
ALL RIGHT, RAY,

15:09.433 --> 15:11.500
I WANT YOU TO SAY SOMETHING
TO ROBERT.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.900
- NO, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,
I CAN'T TALK.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.367
I'M NOT A TALK PERSON.

15:14.367 --> 15:16.867
- RAY, I WANT YOU TO SPEAK
TO YOUR BROTHER TODAY

15:16.867 --> 15:18.067
LIKE HE MATTERS!

15:18.067 --> 15:21.067
- HE DOES MATTER TO ME, JUDY!

15:21.067 --> 15:22.500
I JUST--

15:22.500 --> 15:24.633
I CAN'T STAND
SEEIN' HIM LIKE THIS!

15:24.633 --> 15:26.733
- DON'T TELL ME!

15:50.900 --> 15:53.533
- OKAY, LOOK.

15:53.533 --> 15:56.967
I KNOW I DON'T SAY THIS ENOUGH,
BUT...

15:56.967 --> 16:00.833
YOU ARE MY BROTHER,
AND I LOVE YOU.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.733
OKAY, BUT...

16:03.733 --> 16:05.000
HERE'S THE THING.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.233
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW,
RIGHT?

16:06.233 --> 16:08.600
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.533
I MEAN, YEAH, YEAH,
WE GET MAD AT EACH OTHER,

16:11.533 --> 16:13.633
BUT WE NEVER LET IT GET TOO FAR,
YOU KNOW,

16:13.633 --> 16:17.700
'CAUSE--'CAUSE WE'RE FAMILY.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.000
AND WE DON'T WALK AWAY.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.867
THIS--THIS IS WALKING AWAY.

16:22.867 --> 16:26.167
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO IT, BECAUSE...

16:30.433 --> 16:33.333
YOU'RE LIKE A PART OF ME.

16:43.767 --> 16:44.800
[knocking at door]

16:44.800 --> 16:46.033
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

16:46.033 --> 16:47.133
- NO.
JUDY, DON'T OPEN IT!

16:47.133 --> 16:48.967
DON'T OPEN IT.
JUDY!

16:48.967 --> 16:50.600
- WHAT IS THIS, A PARTY?

16:50.600 --> 16:54.733
WHAT? YOU LOCK ME OUT
TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM CAKE NOW?

16:54.733 --> 16:56.800
- JUST GO HOME, FRANK.
- YEAH, DAD, GO.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.433
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
AT THE LODGE?

16:58.433 --> 17:01.767
- THE POOL'S GOT A FUNGUS.

17:03.967 --> 17:05.767
WELL, WHAT'S THE PARTY FOR,

17:05.767 --> 17:07.267
THE DALAI LAMA OVER HERE?

17:07.267 --> 17:10.200
- OKAY, COME ON.
PLEASE, DAD, NOT NOW.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.767
- [singing] HELLO, DALAI

17:12.767 --> 17:14.200
- FRANK.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.367
- [singing] WELL, HELLO, DALAI

17:17.367 --> 17:18.633
- DAD!

17:18.633 --> 17:20.733
- [singing IT'S SO NICE
THAT MY SON'S HEAD

17:20.733 --> 17:23.533
IS FILLED WITH CRAP

17:23.533 --> 17:26.067
- FRANK, COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

17:26.067 --> 17:27.533
SEE, WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DO HERE

17:27.533 --> 17:29.667
IS REINFORCE THE FAMILY THING,

17:29.667 --> 17:31.500
LET ROBERT KNOW
WE'RE HERE FOR HIM,

17:31.500 --> 17:34.233
NURTURE HIM A LITTLE BIT TODAY.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.467
- OH.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.733
HEY, MORON!
- FRANK!

17:47.733 --> 17:50.000
- NO, THIS GUY'S BEEN CODDLED
HIS WHOLE LIFE!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.533
THAT'S WHY HE HAS NO BRAINS.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.333
THAT'S WHY HE CAN'T THINK
FOR HIMSELF.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.700
THAT'S WHY HE JOINS
A FREAKIN' CULT!

17:56.700 --> 17:58.833
SNAP OUT OF IT, LUNKHEAD!

17:58.833 --> 18:01.967
YOU KNOW WHAT THE ONLY THING
YOU NEED NOW IS?

18:01.967 --> 18:04.533
A GOOD KICK IN THE PANTS!

18:04.533 --> 18:06.033
[thud]

18:08.100 --> 18:09.900
- OH, YEAH?

18:09.900 --> 18:11.367
WHAT'S THAT, HUH?

18:11.367 --> 18:12.833
THE NAME
OF YOUR PARENTING BOOK?

18:12.833 --> 18:15.200
"A GOOD KICK IN THE PANTS"?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.633
THANKS A LOT, DAD.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.600
IT'S WORKED WONDERS FOR ME
OVER THE YEARS.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.967
- COME ON, ROBERT.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.867
HE PEES IN THE YARD.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.033
STOP!
- I'M LEAVING.

18:23.033 --> 18:24.167
- NO, NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

18:24.167 --> 18:25.667
COME ON;
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.333
- NO, WE'RE NOT, OKAY?
JUST FORGET IT, RAY.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.933
I'M GOING BACK TO INNERPATH.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.467
THIS IS A NEGATIVE PLACE,
AND IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.867
HE'S JUST THE POSTER BOY.
IT'S HER AND HER TOO.

18:34.867 --> 18:35.933
- WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

18:35.933 --> 18:37.367
WHAT ABOUT WHAT I JUST SAID?

18:37.367 --> 18:39.567
- NICE TRY, BUT YOU'RE
NOT THAT GOOD AN ACTOR.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.367
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

18:44.367 --> 18:46.867
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO BACK
TO YOUR STUPID CULT?

18:46.867 --> 18:48.433
- IT'S NOT A CULT, OKAY?

18:48.433 --> 18:50.267
I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY,

18:50.267 --> 18:53.433
BUT I'VE CONFIRMED SOMETHING
HERE TODAY:

18:53.433 --> 18:56.200
THAT THE PATH
TO INNER PEACE AND HARMONY

18:56.200 --> 18:59.167
CLEARLY CANNOT BE FOUND
IN THIS FAMILY.

18:59.167 --> 19:00.400
GOOD-BYE.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.400
- ROBERT, WAIT!

19:02.400 --> 19:03.767

SIT DOWN.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.700

DON'T JOIN A CULT.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.033
HAVE SOME CAKE.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.000
- NO!

19:09.000 --> 19:11.367
- ROBERT, I JUST WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.267
- WHY?
- BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU!

19:13.267 --> 19:14.767
- AND I'M YOUR MOTHER!

19:14.767 --> 19:16.567
- WHY WOULD I TAKE ADVICE
ABOUT LIFE FROM YOU TWO?

19:16.567 --> 19:18.600
YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK
TO EACH OTHER!

19:18.600 --> 19:20.433
- YES, WE CAN!

19:23.467 --> 19:25.767
OH, DEBRA!
- OH, MARIE!

19:30.100 --> 19:32.800
- OH, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.900

19:34.900 --> 19:36.900

19:44.700 --> 19:47.733
WE ARE A FAMILY.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

19:47.733 --> 19:49.833

GOOD GOING.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.567

20:02.933 --> 20:04.367

20:04.367 --> 20:06.733
Y-YOU GUYS PLANNED
THIS WHOLE THING?

20:06.733 --> 20:08.200
- WHAT?

20:08.200 --> 20:11.800
- DESPERATE TIMES
CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.300
- YOU'RE NOT MAD, ARE YOU?

20:14.300 --> 20:16.067
- NO, I'M NOT MAD.

20:16.067 --> 20:17.500
- OH.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.933
HOW COULD I BE MAD
WHEN YOU GAVE DEBRA BACK TO ME?

20:19.933 --> 20:23.033
- YEAH, WELL, THEN THERE'S
SOMEBODY ELSE YOU SHOULD THANK.

20:23.033 --> 20:26.200
- [chuckling]

20:26.200 --> 20:29.600
AND THE OSCAR GOES TO...

20:29.600 --> 20:35.133
- YEAH, BUT WHAT WAS WITH
THAT SLAP IN THE HEAD?

20:35.133 --> 20:37.400
- I WAS IN THE MOMENT.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.000
- YOU WERE TRICKING US?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.933
- WHAT?
YOU MAD AT ME NOW?

20:43.933 --> 20:45.600
HOW COME YOU'RE FINE WITH THEM?

20:45.600 --> 20:47.200
- BECAUSE THEY'RE NICE BOYS,

20:47.200 --> 20:49.800
AND YOU'RE A GLOATING
NINCOMPOOP!

20:49.800 --> 20:51.733
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE CAKE I MADE.

20:51.733 --> 20:54.100
IT'S CHOCOLATE, BUT IT'S
DIFFERENT THAN THE USUAL ONE...

20:56.800 --> 20:59.133
- ROBERT, THIS CULT.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.133
- OH, MAN.
GREAT GAME.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.833
- YUP. YUP.

21:08.833 --> 21:11.133
- I STILL DON'T GET
WHY YOU EVER WANTED

21:11.133 --> 21:13.600
TO JOIN A STUPID CULT.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.267
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.

21:15.267 --> 21:16.333
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS?

21:16.333 --> 21:17.933
STUPID! STUPID!
STUPID! STUPID!

21:17.933 --> 21:19.000
STUPID! STUPID!
STUPID! STUPID!

21:19.000 --> 21:21.433
YEAH!

21:25.233 --> 21:27.800

21:32.467 --> 21:35.600
LAUGHS, THE BALL GAME,
FREE WILL,

21:35.600 --> 21:37.600
DOING WHAT YOU WANT
WHEN YOU WANT IT.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.167
YOU DON'T GET THAT
IN ANY STINKIN' CULT.

21:40.167 --> 21:41.867
- ALL RIGHT, TV OFF.
IT'S LUNCH.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.300
all: [in monotone]
OKAY.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.167

21:47.600 --> 21:48.833
Marie:
