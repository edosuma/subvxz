of the past few years
with a couple of surprises.

49:11.066 --> 49:12.770
The first,
you've already met: Ray.

49:12.803 --> 49:14.306
He's in the beta phase,

49:14.339 --> 49:16.511
but I think his introduction
to the world

49:16.544 --> 49:19.449
could be something
of a revelation.

49:19.482 --> 49:22.556
Personal assistant,
teacher, therapist.

49:22.589 --> 49:25.061
Some people would
refer to him as

49:25.094 --> 49:26.430
artificial intelligence.

49:26.463 --> 49:28.334
I prefer the term...

49:28.367 --> 49:30.672
-alternative intelligence.
-Alternative intelligence.

49:30.705 --> 49:32.442
[Andy laughs]

49:32.475 --> 49:35.047
[soft laughter]

49:35.080 --> 49:38.320
The second surprise

49:38.353 --> 49:40.692
is, uh, bringing you
all here to Iceland.

49:40.725 --> 49:46.571
Now, you're the first people
to stay in this hotel.

49:46.604 --> 49:49.142
And the reason that I built it

49:49.175 --> 49:51.079
is because I believe

49:51.112 --> 49:53.350
we're in one of the last true

49:53.383 --> 49:56.557
great areas of wilderness left.

49:56.590 --> 50:00.064
No, please, don't give him that.

50:00.097 --> 50:02.435
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

50:02.468 --> 50:05.041
By the time
this little one is 18,

50:05.074 --> 50:07.045
this planet that we call home

50:07.078 --> 50:09.048
could be past
the point of no return.

50:10.050 --> 50:13.357
200 million climate refugees
projected by 2050.

50:13.390 --> 50:15.629
26 trillion

50:15.662 --> 50:17.700
in damages by storms,

50:17.733 --> 50:21.741
wildfires and droughts by 2070.

50:21.774 --> 50:24.747
The facts are hysterical,
but they are accurate.

50:24.780 --> 50:27.118
They are facts.

50:27.151 --> 50:30.358
Margaret Atwood
said in an article

50:30.391 --> 50:32.796
that the nearer we get
to the climate crisis,

50:32.829 --> 50:34.399
the fewer choices we have,

50:34.432 --> 50:36.269
but we still have some,

50:36.302 --> 50:38.073
and we have to
start making them.

50:39.275 --> 50:41.480
Now, some of you
are technologists,

50:41.514 --> 50:44.587
some of you are deeply
critical of technology.

50:44.620 --> 50:46.758
Some of you have

50:46.791 --> 50:49.462
designer degrees, some of you
dropped out of college

50:49.495 --> 50:52.636
like I did, but everyone
sitting here at this table

50:52.669 --> 50:56.109
is an original thinker.

50:56.142 --> 50:58.147
That's why you're here.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.650
And it is original thought,

50:59.683 --> 51:01.153
more than money,

51:01.186 --> 51:03.758
oil, or even water,

51:03.791 --> 51:07.298

there is a future to be had.
