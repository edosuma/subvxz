00:00.001 --> 00:01.428
Previously on <i>Riverdale...</i>

00:02.659 --> 00:04.385
That kid is a star.

00:04.454 --> 00:06.053
- Can I kiss you?
- Archie.

00:07.891 --> 00:09.857
You broke the code.
Turn in your jackets and go.

00:09.926 --> 00:12.026
I'm a Serpent by blood.

00:12.095 --> 00:15.263
- What's this?
- A gang, and you're the leader.

00:15.331 --> 00:18.132
<i>I think my mom may have
hired someone to shoot my father</i>

00:18.201 --> 00:21.502
so that she could make a profit
from the sale of his drug operation.

00:21.571 --> 00:23.404
Let's end this nightmare.

00:23.473 --> 00:26.407
<i>Find the drugs and destroy them
before my mom sells everything.</i>

00:26.476 --> 00:29.911
What the hell did you do? I used the cash
from the sale to pay off Governor Dooley.

00:29.979 --> 00:33.281
<i>And now my buyer is coming,
and they are gonna want blood.</i>

00:33.349 --> 00:35.249
Here's your money.
Or as much as we could get of it.

00:35.318 --> 00:37.985
We'll figure out
a payment plan for the rest.

00:41.891 --> 00:43.991
<i>Gryphons and Gargoyles.</i>

00:44.060 --> 00:46.828
<i>Serpents and Ghoulies.</i>

00:46.896 --> 00:50.198
<i>Riverdale was a veritable jungle
of mythological creatures,</i>

00:50.266 --> 00:53.267
<i>species jockeying for power,</i>

00:53.336 --> 00:55.036
<i>and the dark heart of it all...</i>

00:55.104 --> 00:57.338
Good morning, sunshine.

00:57.407 --> 00:58.806
Wakey, wakey.

00:59.843 --> 01:01.309
Breakfast is served.

01:01.377 --> 01:03.144
Wow, Mom.

01:04.947 --> 01:07.114
That's way better
than my normal breakfast.

01:08.384 --> 01:10.418
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.754
- Did you sleep on it wrong?
- There's no right way to sleep on a couch.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.189
- Do you want the bed?
- No, I'm fine.

01:15.258 --> 01:18.259
I need coffee.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.295
You let her drink coffee?

01:21.364 --> 01:25.299
Okay, it's fine by me.
Help yourself.

01:25.368 --> 01:27.235
I gotta get to work.

01:27.303 --> 01:29.170
Hey, if you need anything,
you call me.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.677
- Morning, Betty.
- Morning, Mom.

01:39.449 --> 01:41.749
Is that your wedding dress?

01:41.818 --> 01:44.519
It is. I'm getting it altered.

01:47.123 --> 01:49.423
Why, are you getting married?

01:49.492 --> 01:52.527
In a sense. I'm being baptized
into the Farm.

01:54.898 --> 01:57.365
Sorry, you're what?

01:57.433 --> 01:59.267
Edgar says I'm finally ready.

01:59.335 --> 02:03.204
All of the women from the Farm are
gathering Sunday night at the new facility.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.914
<i>Mija?</i>
Can I see you for a moment?

02:17.687 --> 02:19.887
I've been getting caught up on things.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.959
Hopefully, you can answer a
question that's been nagging me.

02:25.028 --> 02:26.761
In the short time I was laid up,

02:26.829 --> 02:31.999
some very valuable equipment and
stock went missing from my prison.

02:32.068 --> 02:36.070
Didn't Mom say that she had to have
it destroyed because of the Feds?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.173
Yeah, she did.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.112
Tall Boy, an ex-Serpent,
tried to kill me.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.249
FP, an ex-Serpent,
is now sheriff.

02:48.318 --> 02:51.652
Gladys, a Toledo Serpent,
is back in town after years away,

02:51.721 --> 02:55.723
and suddenly, I'm out
some very valuable assets.

02:55.792 --> 02:59.026
If I didn't know better, I'd say
the Joneses pulled a fast one on me.

02:59.095 --> 03:03.664
They strike me as opportunists,
not master schemers.

03:03.733 --> 03:06.567
At a minimum, they would certainly
need the help of someone close to me

03:06.636 --> 03:07.868
to pull anything like this off.

03:10.239 --> 03:13.374
Oh, well.
The truth will shake out.

03:15.812 --> 03:17.778
It always does.

03:21.884 --> 03:25.453
How about we skip class,
catch a matinee at the Bijou?

03:25.521 --> 03:28.489
Oh, wow, you're sweeter than
a strawberry milkshake, Arch.

03:28.558 --> 03:30.891
But I've got a meeting
with our college advisor.

03:32.428 --> 03:34.128
Maybe we can meet up after school?

03:34.197 --> 03:37.064
- Actually, I'm training with Mr. Keller then.
- Oh.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.667
Are there any college
scholarships for boxing out there?

03:39.736 --> 03:43.137
No. But stepping in
between those ropes, Josie,

03:43.206 --> 03:46.073
it gets me and keeps me in a
good headspace. Helps me focus.

03:47.744 --> 03:49.777
I forget about everything else
outside the ring.

03:52.515 --> 03:55.216
Well, almost everything else.

03:55.284 --> 03:59.053
Yeah, well, just don't go messing
up that pretty face, Andrews.

03:59.122 --> 04:00.688
It's growing on me.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.791
It was the weirdest thing, Jug.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.926
My mom's usually rubbing
the Farm in my face,

04:05.995 --> 04:10.865
but now she's shutting me out.
Like she's washed her hands of me.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.366
Which is even more terrifying.

04:12.435 --> 04:15.269
They're definitely up to
some serious shadiness,

04:15.338 --> 04:17.838
like they're entrenching.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.807
I was trying to dig up
some dirt online on the Farm,

04:19.875 --> 04:24.211
and I couldn't even find a photograph
of Edgar Evernever. Not one, Jug.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.880
That's weird.

04:25.948 --> 04:27.982
If you really want to protect your
mother, maybe it's worthwhile

04:28.051 --> 04:30.885
just embracing
this whole baptism thing.

04:30.953 --> 04:32.687
Or at least pretending to embrace it.

04:32.755 --> 04:35.222
It may help you keep tabs
on her. Make sure she's safe.

04:37.226 --> 04:38.392
Come on.

04:42.665 --> 04:43.931
Where the hell is everyone else?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.366
Oh, we're down another eight.

04:45.435 --> 04:47.802
- Another eight?
- All girls.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.103
Where are they all going?

04:49.172 --> 04:51.105
Turns out Toni and Cheryl
started their own gang.

04:51.174 --> 04:54.208
- All the girls are defecting to it.
- The Pretty Poisons.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.345
So, what do you want
us to do, boss?

04:58.414 --> 05:02.149
Nothing. This is all because
I banished Cheryl and Toni.

05:03.319 --> 05:04.852
I just need to talk to Toni,

05:04.921 --> 05:06.854
get her back into the Serpent fold,
and the rest will come back, too.

05:06.923 --> 05:08.989
They need to be reminded
what it means to be a Serpent.

05:10.827 --> 05:12.093
I'll make this right.

05:13.696 --> 05:14.995
One, one, two.

05:16.833 --> 05:17.832
Spider.

05:20.837 --> 05:22.670
Keep your hand up, right?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.538
It's the first thing I learned
boxing in the army.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.174
And you've got a nasty habit
of telegraphing your punches.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.443
You do that with an experienced
fighter in the ring,

05:29.512 --> 05:31.779
and he'll see you
coming from a mile away.

05:31.848 --> 05:33.881
All due respect, Mr. Keller,

05:33.950 --> 05:35.616
those guys at L&L
sure as hell didn't.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.720
Get me a fight, a real fight,

05:39.789 --> 05:41.689
with some of these guys training in
here, I can show you.

05:41.758 --> 05:46.293
Archie, you've got good speed,
all right, and you've got some power,

05:47.296 --> 05:49.230
but you've got no technique.

05:49.298 --> 05:52.733
You have to learn that, and until you do,
don't even think about your first fight.

05:53.669 --> 05:55.302
How long are we talking about?

05:55.371 --> 05:58.405
Archie, you're not ready.

05:58.474 --> 06:01.108
How are we meant to know that
until you get me in the ring?

06:01.177 --> 06:03.711
I need to know if boxing is
gonna be a viable option for me.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.247
Trust me.

06:06.315 --> 06:08.315
Boxing is not something
you want to do half-assed.

06:10.386 --> 06:11.886
Good workout.
Hit the showers.

06:17.860 --> 06:18.859
This week's payment.

06:22.832 --> 06:24.398
So, here's the deal.

06:24.467 --> 06:28.169
My dad suspects that you and FP
are behind his recent troubles,

06:28.237 --> 06:31.338
that you came back to Riverdale
to steal his drug trade.

06:32.408 --> 06:34.441
Why is that my problem?

06:34.510 --> 06:38.779
Because he's fired up about rebuilding his
empire, and you don't want to get in his way.

06:38.848 --> 06:41.649
Also, maybe you don't want
him to find out

06:41.717 --> 06:45.619
that Mommy tried to sell his business
out from under him, am I right?

06:46.589 --> 06:48.656
No comment.

06:48.724 --> 06:52.960
Clue me in on your dad's moves and that
debt you owe me, I might ease it slightly.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.931
You want me to spy on my father?
For you?

06:58.234 --> 06:59.967
That's not gonna happen.

07:00.036 --> 07:03.637
I don't want to cause a drama here.
I just want to get what's owed to me,

07:04.574 --> 07:06.407
plus a little bit more.

07:06.475 --> 07:11.011
And now it looks as though I'm in a race
with your dad to rebuild the candy trade.

07:11.080 --> 07:15.416
Who do you want to be
in charge, me or him?

07:16.152 --> 07:17.084
You.

07:19.722 --> 07:21.322
I want my family out of drugs.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.624
So, we both want the same thing.
What's the problem?

07:24.660 --> 07:27.361
Either you get Hiram
out of my way,

07:27.430 --> 07:30.531
or sniff out what he's doing.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.800
Let me know, so I can
stay ahead of him.

07:35.504 --> 07:37.504
I know what you're after, Elio,

07:37.573 --> 07:39.273
but it ain't happening here.

07:39.342 --> 07:41.942
Any boxer in this dump
would be lucky to fight Randy.

07:42.011 --> 07:44.645
- It's just good business.
- For you, sure. Not for me.

07:49.185 --> 07:50.117
Elio.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.387
Archie Andrews?
You training here?

07:53.456 --> 07:55.890
Yeah.

07:55.958 --> 07:59.927
And if you need an opponent for your
guy, I'll do it. I'll take the fight.

07:59.996 --> 08:01.362
How many bouts
you have under your belt?

08:01.964 --> 08:03.297
Well, none.

08:03.366 --> 08:05.332
But I gotta get in the ring.
Otherwise, what's the point?

08:07.103 --> 08:10.704
Well, it's your lucky day.
Congrats! He's got your first fight.

08:10.773 --> 08:13.340
One condition, I need you to
guarantee me that you'll lose.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.278
Are you serious?

08:17.346 --> 08:19.947
Throw the fight,
make Randy here look good doing it.

08:23.019 --> 08:25.252
No, Elio.
I'm not taking a dive.

08:25.321 --> 08:27.021
I'm offering you
a golden opportunity

08:27.089 --> 08:29.256
to start to make a name for
yourself. This is how it goes.

08:29.325 --> 08:32.493
Start building a rep.
First step to becoming a champ

08:32.561 --> 08:34.061
is fighting a champ.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.697
Boxing's like any other profession.
You've gotta pay your dues.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.831
But, in this case,

08:37.900 --> 08:40.534
you also get paid.
Five thousand dollars.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.338
- For one fight?
- Three rounds, that's all.

08:44.407 --> 08:47.007
My guy gets another win,
you get on the board.

08:47.076 --> 08:49.910
I mean, for a guy like you,
this is as good as it's gonna get.

08:51.714 --> 08:52.913
I want to get paid first.

08:53.883 --> 08:54.949
Today, now.

08:55.017 --> 08:57.217
Half now, half after the fight.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.223
You're gonna thank me, Red.
Let's go.

09:07.036 --> 09:10.368

== <font color="#138CE9">https://</font>subscene<font color="#138CE9">.com</font> ==

09:12.356 --> 09:13.955
I'm worried about you, Daddy.

09:14.725 --> 09:15.824
About our family.

09:17.494 --> 09:20.261
I know you were dealing drugs.

09:20.330 --> 09:23.798
But the drugs and the equipment
you used to manufacture them,

09:23.867 --> 09:24.999
it's all gone.

09:26.002 --> 09:28.536
You have an opportunity
to go clean,

09:29.673 --> 09:32.340
- to build a new empire.
- No.

09:32.409 --> 09:33.842
What kind of opportunity
were you thinking?

09:33.910 --> 09:35.810
Refocus on your prison.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.178
Get it back on track.

09:37.247 --> 09:39.514
You can fill the cells
with criminals

09:39.583 --> 09:43.418
and make more money imprisoning
drug dealers than supplying them.

09:43.487 --> 09:44.686
And it's legal.

09:45.288 --> 09:46.321
That's good,

09:50.193 --> 09:51.493
but you're thinking too small.

09:52.863 --> 09:54.596
Here's what
I'm thinking instead,

09:54.664 --> 09:58.900
Penny Peabody used the Ghoulies to
manufacture, distribute, and sell

10:00.137 --> 10:01.469
candy.

10:01.538 --> 10:06.808
Now that she's MIA, her gang is...
Well, it's leaderless,

10:06.877 --> 10:10.478
up for grabs.
If I gain control of the Ghoulies,

10:10.547 --> 10:12.514
I regain control of the trade.

10:19.222 --> 10:22.090
You're a Topaz.
Being in the Serpents is your birthright.

10:23.860 --> 10:25.460
We are a family.

10:25.529 --> 10:28.196
I'd like you to reconsider
joining the gang.

10:28.265 --> 10:30.532
You want me back
in the Serpents?

10:30.600 --> 10:35.437
Make me Queen. I mean, since
I'm legacy and all, right?

10:37.240 --> 10:38.807
You know I can't do that, Toni.

10:38.875 --> 10:43.711
Because of Betty, right?
Then I'm not coming back.

10:43.780 --> 10:46.414
What are the Pretty Poisons providing
for you that the Serpents can't?

10:47.551 --> 10:49.651
An opportunity to lead.

10:51.421 --> 10:53.888
With the Pretty Poisons, I rule.

10:55.492 --> 10:56.925
We're a sisterhood.

10:56.993 --> 10:58.660
You're Cheryl's
vanity project, you mean.

11:01.398 --> 11:04.799
And you're wrong about the
Serpents still being a family.

11:04.868 --> 11:07.836
That's what we used to be.
Not anymore.

11:11.908 --> 11:13.508
Alice, you're going
to look like heaven on Earth.

11:13.577 --> 11:16.811
What do you think, Betty?

11:18.882 --> 11:21.015
I think it's really pretty, Mom.

11:21.084 --> 11:23.318
I'm so happy you decided
to be a part of this.

11:24.788 --> 11:26.154
You know how much
this means to me.

11:26.223 --> 11:27.455
Of course, Mom.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.693
Oh, Alice, I need to get
those forms back.

11:31.761 --> 11:33.428
Oh, right. They're right here.

11:33.497 --> 11:35.830
- What forms?
- Just boilerplate.

11:36.933 --> 11:37.866
Elizabeth.

11:39.936 --> 11:43.872
What kind of baptism requires
a signed release form

11:43.940 --> 11:49.043
exculpating the organization in
case of "bodily harm or death"?

11:49.112 --> 11:54.849
It's a standard form. I signed one
scarier when I joined 23-Hour Fitness.

11:54.918 --> 11:56.718
Your mother is on the verge
of discovering something

11:56.786 --> 11:59.721
that some people spend their whole
lives looking for and never find.

11:59.789 --> 12:02.190
There is no need to be afraid
or to stand in the way of that.

12:02.259 --> 12:04.726
Um, there is
if she's going to get hurt.

12:04.794 --> 12:08.062
It's just like Edgar said.
You're a detractor.

12:08.131 --> 12:10.598
But I'm not going to let
you ruin this day for Mom.

12:10.667 --> 12:15.203
Fine. But if Mom dies,
then her blood is on your hands, Polly.

12:20.944 --> 12:22.544
You look beautiful.

12:22.612 --> 12:24.779
My father is going
after the Ghoulies.

12:24.848 --> 12:26.514
He says they're the cooks
and the runners.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.650
So, if you wanna win this war,

12:29.519 --> 12:31.085
you need soldiers to fight it.

12:31.521 --> 12:33.955
Well,

12:34.024 --> 12:37.191
it looks like the pretty bird
bought herself another day.

12:38.261 --> 12:40.361
Keep up the good work,
little magpie.

12:46.036 --> 12:47.569
Hey. Hey, hey.

12:47.637 --> 12:50.104
You took a fight against Randy Ronson?
Are you nuts?

12:50.173 --> 12:51.839
The guy is 12 and 0
with ten KOs.

12:51.908 --> 12:53.608
You haven't even fought
a round yet.

12:53.677 --> 12:55.343
I have to prove myself somehow.

12:55.412 --> 12:56.911
Elio's giving me the chance
to do that.

12:56.980 --> 13:00.615
Ronson, he fights dirty.
He sucker-punched one of his opponents,

13:00.684 --> 13:03.151
the guy nosedived into his stool,
and he hasn't walked since.

13:03.219 --> 13:07.722
Archie, you make the call, you cancel the
fight, or you find yourself a new coach.

13:10.827 --> 13:12.093
<i>Archers, draw!</i>

13:13.863 --> 13:16.931
Anchor your hand
at the corner of your mouth.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.600
Use your dominant eye.

13:19.703 --> 13:22.203
Now, relax, my pretties.

13:23.139 --> 13:24.205
Release.

13:26.009 --> 13:28.776
<i>Brava.</i> Now go again.

13:28.845 --> 13:31.279
Nice work, Poisons.

13:31.348 --> 13:33.448
They have an excellent mentor,
Tee.

13:33.516 --> 13:34.949
They certainly do, babe.

13:39.356 --> 13:42.757
- Something wrong,<i> mon tresor?</i>
- Jughead.

13:42.826 --> 13:44.626
He tried to convince me
to rejoin the Serpents.

13:45.161 --> 13:46.127
That worm.

13:47.230 --> 13:48.596
- What did you say?
- No.

13:48.665 --> 13:53.668
Obviously. He had the audacity
to call us a vanity project.

13:53.737 --> 13:57.305
But don't worry, babe, I'm gonna figure
out a way to put him in his place.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:08.952 --> 14:12.987
Time to show Jughead just how
poisonous we pretties can be.

14:15.392 --> 14:17.125
- Heads or tails for this. Ready?
- Heads.

14:18.862 --> 14:20.495
- Tails, mine.
- Tails, what?

14:22.298 --> 14:23.631
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.833
- Well, ladies, evening.
- Hey.

14:28.104 --> 14:32.974
Look, girls, we don't want any
trouble from your little sorority.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.743
Don't call us girls.
And don't belittle us.

14:35.812 --> 14:39.180
Or what? You're gonna
challenge us to a pillow fight?

14:41.651 --> 14:42.817
Seriously, Cheryl, what is this?

14:42.886 --> 14:45.620
We're the Pretty Poisons,
peabrain.

14:45.689 --> 14:48.589
And we're here to deliver a
message to you and your leader

14:48.658 --> 14:51.659
that we are not to be
dismissed or trifled with.

14:53.596 --> 14:56.264
Ladies? Introduce yourselves.

14:56.332 --> 15:00.168
- Take it easy, okay?
- Hey, honestly, we don't want any trouble.

15:02.338 --> 15:03.371
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop!

15:06.166 --> 15:08.600
- Ow!
- You guys are joke.

15:08.669 --> 15:11.803
Jug, if you don't get
your house in order,

15:11.872 --> 15:13.538
more people are going to defect

15:13.607 --> 15:15.473
and more gangs are going
to start popping up.

15:15.542 --> 15:20.145
And the Serpents' little piece of the
pie is going to get smaller and smaller.

15:20.213 --> 15:22.847
The store's open for suggestions, Mom.
You got any?

15:22.916 --> 15:28.153
You need numbers. Now I happen to know
for a fact the Ghoulies are up for grabs.

15:28.221 --> 15:31.656
Ever since I took care of
Penny, they've been leaderless.

15:31.725 --> 15:35.961
- Recruit 'em.
- The Ghoulies tried to burn down Pop's on riot night.

15:36.029 --> 15:39.564
So tame them and give them
something they want.

15:39.633 --> 15:42.033
Trust me, this is your
only shot at survival.

15:47.374 --> 15:49.941
Hey, T.T. Check out
my new nail color.

15:50.010 --> 15:52.110
It's called Vigilante Violet.
What do you think?

15:52.179 --> 15:54.212
I heard what you and the girls
did to Sweet Pea and Fangs.

15:56.183 --> 15:58.950
The Serpents needed to know that
the Pretty Poisons are here to stay

15:59.019 --> 16:00.285
and that we are not
to be trifled with.

16:00.354 --> 16:02.620
I said I was going to handle it.

16:02.689 --> 16:05.523
The purpose of our gang isn't
to air out your petty grievances

16:05.592 --> 16:07.826
or pursue your personal vendettas.

16:07.894 --> 16:09.828
It's for protection
and community.

16:09.896 --> 16:11.496
I was sending a message.
Planting a flag.

16:11.565 --> 16:13.765
Oh, cut the crap, Cheryl.
Let me ask you this.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.134
Is this gang mine? Or yours?

16:18.572 --> 16:22.073
It's yours. Of course.

16:22.142 --> 16:25.310
Then never deploy the Poisons
that way again without asking me.

16:26.046 --> 16:27.245
Is that clear?

16:27.314 --> 16:29.614
As a bottle of sparkling
San Junipero water.

16:39.459 --> 16:41.026
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:41.094 --> 16:45.730
So, I'm singing a little Tina at
La Bonne Nuit on Sunday night,

16:45.799 --> 16:48.133
and I wouldn't mind having you
on guitar.

16:48.201 --> 16:49.834
- Sunday?
- Yeah.

16:49.903 --> 16:52.003
I can't, I got a match.

16:52.973 --> 16:55.540
- What? Your first fight?
- Yeah.

16:55.609 --> 16:57.809
That's major, Archie!
Why didn't you tell me?

16:58.812 --> 17:00.745
Because I'm gonna lose.

17:00.814 --> 17:02.647
Well, with that attitude,
yeah, you are.

17:02.716 --> 17:05.349
No, I mean I'm the fall guy.
I'm getting paid to throw the fight.

17:05.419 --> 17:06.751
Oh. Hold on.

17:07.587 --> 17:08.586
That sounds shady.

17:08.655 --> 17:10.622
It's a shortcut.

17:10.690 --> 17:14.392
It's gonna get me in the game,
it's gonna get my name out there.

17:14.461 --> 17:16.594
Look, it's like,
before you can be a headliner,

17:16.663 --> 17:19.364
- you gotta be the opening act.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:19.433 --> 17:22.700
But getting paid
to be beaten down?

17:22.769 --> 17:25.737
Josie, I'm an ex-con who walked
out of the SATs, remember?

17:25.806 --> 17:28.640
Look, you've been dealt
some truly rotten hands,

17:28.708 --> 17:32.544
Archie, no doubt. But you've
gotta turn it around for yourself,

17:32.612 --> 17:35.313
- with dignity.
- It's a lot of money.

17:35.382 --> 17:39.284
- Five grand.
- Wow. Five grand, that's...

17:39.352 --> 17:41.119
So that's what you think
you're worth?

17:42.989 --> 17:45.790
I know you're looking
for something, we all are

17:45.859 --> 17:47.659
in this messed-up town,

17:47.727 --> 17:51.863
but selling yourself out to be
somebody's punching bag? No.

17:51.932 --> 17:53.364
You're worth more than that.

17:57.037 --> 17:59.104
<i>Kev, I need your help.</i>

17:59.172 --> 18:02.173
- Betty, what is it? What's wrong?
- The Farm is a cult.

18:02.242 --> 18:06.344
My mom is joining a cult and no one else
but me seems to be worried about it.

18:06.413 --> 18:08.079
- Betty...
- No, just listen to me,

18:08.148 --> 18:12.584
the only way to get real dirt on a
cult is to talk to a cult escapee.

18:12.652 --> 18:16.588
So I started googling, and
I found all of these articles.

18:16.656 --> 18:19.357
Dozens of stories
about people who have escaped.

18:19.426 --> 18:20.592
The Farm?

18:20.660 --> 18:23.761
I have a list of over
30 names, all escapees.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.363
You have to help me call them.

18:25.432 --> 18:26.431
I can't help you with this.

18:27.601 --> 18:29.300
Why? Why not?

18:29.369 --> 18:31.970
After what happened with
Moose, and him leaving town,

18:32.038 --> 18:33.972
Evelyn started talking to me.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.642
She's helped me a lot. She even said she'd
introduce me to some cute gay Farmies.

18:37.711 --> 18:39.344
Kev,

18:39.412 --> 18:42.313
please tell me you're not thinking
about actually joining the Farm.

18:42.382 --> 18:45.517
What if I am? You shouldn't be so ready
to see the worst in people, Betty,

18:45.585 --> 18:46.684
it isn't healthy.

18:50.991 --> 18:54.359
The Ghoulies, they're a drug club.
They can't be house-trained.

18:54.427 --> 18:58.897
That's the Gargoyles, Dad.
The Ghoulies just need a strong leader.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.666
Dad, I can be that, but
I'm going to need a carrot

19:01.735 --> 19:03.134
that only you can provide.

19:03.203 --> 19:05.203
It would be a lot easier to
get the Ghoulies to join us

19:05.272 --> 19:08.239
if I could say that we had immunity
from the law now that you're sheriff.

19:08.308 --> 19:09.807
Did your mom put you up to this?

19:09.876 --> 19:12.243
Not even in town a week, and
she's already making moves.

19:12.312 --> 19:14.479
Coming to you with
this ask was my idea.

19:14.548 --> 19:17.415
And I know it's risky,
but if we don't bolster our numbers,

19:17.484 --> 19:18.483
we're going to go extinct.

19:20.253 --> 19:22.787
As long as I don't have
to sign anything, yeah,

19:22.856 --> 19:26.391
you can tell 'em Sheriff Jones hasn't
forgotten where he's coming from.

19:26.459 --> 19:27.825
It'll be live and let live.

19:31.064 --> 19:33.464
Have you been in touch
with Governor Dooley lately?

19:34.801 --> 19:36.134
He hasn't been
returning my calls.

19:39.039 --> 19:41.239
No, no,
not since the quarantine.

19:41.308 --> 19:44.876
You know, I saw that you were putting
out our best bottles of rum. Are you

19:44.945 --> 19:46.778
thinking of having
Donald over for drinks?

19:46.846 --> 19:48.580
Oh, no.

19:48.648 --> 19:50.348
Those are for Gladys Jones.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.983
Now that she's back in town,

19:52.052 --> 19:55.019
I thought it might be prudent for
her and me to have a sit-down.

20:05.699 --> 20:06.998
We had a deal.

20:08.668 --> 20:10.301
I deliver payments

20:10.370 --> 20:13.671
and morsels of information,
and you stay the hell away from my family.

20:14.941 --> 20:16.007
Hey,

20:16.076 --> 20:18.009
your old man called me for a meeting.

20:18.078 --> 20:23.181
If you breathe one word to him
about me or my mother,

20:23.250 --> 20:25.883
I'll tell your son that you're
hoping to take over the drug trade.

20:25.952 --> 20:27.485
Wow.

20:27.554 --> 20:28.853
You're trying to shake me down.

20:30.190 --> 20:31.522
That is awesome.

20:31.591 --> 20:34.025
Look, I don't care, you can
blab to him all you want.

20:34.094 --> 20:37.428
He's not gonna kill me for it.
Which, I can't say the same about

20:37.497 --> 20:40.298
what your father will do to
his wife if I spill the beans.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.300
Watch it, Mrs. Jones.

20:42.369 --> 20:44.636
Things could get messy for you.

20:45.972 --> 20:48.539
I'm just taking care
of business, little lady.

20:52.145 --> 20:55.980
And if my meeting with your
father doesn't go my way,

20:56.049 --> 20:58.249
you better say
an Ave Maria for Mommy.

20:59.653 --> 21:00.652
Hmm?

21:02.956 --> 21:06.124
Look, I can't do it.
I can't throw the fight. Here.

21:06.192 --> 21:07.525
It's too late, Andrews.

21:07.594 --> 21:09.060
We had an agreement,

21:09.129 --> 21:11.562
you show up, you fight, you
lose, and everyone gets paid.

21:11.631 --> 21:13.164
I shouldn't have agreed,
I'm sorry...

21:13.233 --> 21:15.133
You're sorry?

21:15.201 --> 21:17.902
Andrews, I don't just arrange fights,

21:17.971 --> 21:19.304
I arrange bets on fights.

21:19.372 --> 21:21.539
And a lot of dangerous men
have put down a lot of money

21:21.608 --> 21:23.641
in anticipation of Ronson beating you.

21:23.710 --> 21:26.010
If you don't show up,
then they're gonna come after me,

21:26.079 --> 21:28.780
and I'm gonna
send them after you.

21:28.848 --> 21:31.616
And if you decide to try
and go rogue in the ring,

21:31.685 --> 21:35.053
try and win, say?
Ronson will end you, right then and there.

21:35.121 --> 21:37.755
Any deviation from our
agreement whatsoever

21:37.824 --> 21:40.291
will end very, very
badly for you.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.592
See you on fight night.

21:44.597 --> 21:46.297
So you're really the last one, huh?

21:46.366 --> 21:47.498
You're the last Ghoulie standing?

21:47.567 --> 21:48.866
Where's the rest of your crew, Verne?

21:48.935 --> 21:52.136
After we lost Malachai,
then Penny,

21:52.205 --> 21:54.305
no one knew who to look to,
who to follow,

21:54.374 --> 21:58.576
so most of the Ghoulies went to
the Gargoyles, started playing G&G.

21:58.645 --> 22:00.845
Now that Tall Boy's dead,
do you know who their leader is?

22:00.914 --> 22:02.380
The closest thing
they've got to a leader

22:02.449 --> 22:04.816
is some whack-job named Kurtz,
who's keeping the game going.

22:04.884 --> 22:05.917
Do you know where he is?

22:06.820 --> 22:08.152
Can you tell me where to go?

22:50.588 --> 22:51.888
Are you Kurtz?

22:54.392 --> 22:55.391
I'm here to talk.

22:56.427 --> 22:57.793
One leader to another.

23:05.136 --> 23:08.604
I'm the Serpent King,
and I'm here to make an offer.

23:08.673 --> 23:11.340
You're all wanted for making
and dealing Fizzle Rocks.

23:11.409 --> 23:13.776
But if you and your Gargoyles
join my gang,

23:13.845 --> 23:17.580
I can promise you immunity from
the sheriff's office, and the law.

23:18.049 --> 23:19.148
Law?

23:20.985 --> 23:22.985
Immunity?

23:23.054 --> 23:25.488
I have looked into
the eyes of the King,

23:26.524 --> 23:31.394
and his is the only law.

23:31.462 --> 23:34.564
The law of Gargoyles,
carved in stone.

23:35.533 --> 23:36.465
Right.

23:37.235 --> 23:38.834
So you wanna play a game?

23:40.038 --> 23:41.237
I'm a Game Master.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.240
Let me be your Game Master.

23:44.309 --> 23:48.644
You think Gryphons and Gargoyles

23:50.215 --> 23:51.614
is a game?

23:53.585 --> 23:54.984
You are mistaken.

23:57.188 --> 24:00.756
You come here as a king,
but you're not a king.

24:00.825 --> 24:04.327
And you think
we're playing a game.

24:06.497 --> 24:09.832
We are living a prophecy.

24:13.104 --> 24:17.473
And you are all just
sacrifices waiting to be made.

24:17.542 --> 24:20.676
The Gargoyle King lives.
He will decide.

24:22.413 --> 24:24.847
And he will choose.

24:29.721 --> 24:31.621
And only the worthy will ascend.

24:40.965 --> 24:42.064
Stick the jab.

24:44.035 --> 24:45.034
Attaboy.

24:45.970 --> 24:47.903
Mr. Keller, got a sec?

24:49.207 --> 24:50.539
What do you want, Arch?

24:55.747 --> 24:56.879
You were right.

24:58.116 --> 25:00.283
I thought this fight
with Ronson would help

25:00.351 --> 25:02.652
jumpstart something, anything.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.453
But I'm not ready.

25:04.522 --> 25:06.055
Definitely not on my own.

25:07.425 --> 25:10.559
Elio paid me to throw
the fight with Ronson.

25:10.628 --> 25:11.627
He did what?

25:11.696 --> 25:13.362
I have no choice
but to fight Ronson,

25:13.431 --> 25:15.231
and I'm worried
he might kill me.

25:18.002 --> 25:20.403
If I'm gonna stand even the
slightest chance of survival,

25:20.471 --> 25:21.904
I need you in my corner.

25:24.108 --> 25:25.908
I've seen some tape on Ronson.

25:25.977 --> 25:27.109
He's strong,

25:28.012 --> 25:29.512
but he wasn't in the army

25:29.580 --> 25:32.248
or didn't go through the meat
grinder of juvie like you did.

25:33.685 --> 25:37.653
- You'll do what I say, Archie?
- Yes, sir, everything.

25:37.722 --> 25:41.457
All right, let's go see what we can do
about making sure you don't get killed.

25:41.526 --> 25:43.659
Excuse me.

25:43.728 --> 25:44.994
Mind if I join you?

25:45.063 --> 25:46.829
Hi, I'm Veronica Lodge.

25:46.898 --> 25:48.731
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.299
I don't believe we have.

25:50.368 --> 25:52.068
You're Jughead's mom, right?

25:52.136 --> 25:55.104
<i>Mija,</i> I was hoping to have
a private conversation.

25:55.873 --> 25:57.506
Aw, what's the big deal?

25:57.575 --> 25:58.974
Let her join.

25:59.043 --> 26:00.042
She's so gorgeous.

26:00.111 --> 26:01.944
You do trust her, don't you?

26:02.013 --> 26:04.213
Yes, I do.
I trust her very much.

26:04.282 --> 26:05.581
So we can speak freely?

26:06.684 --> 26:07.616
Absolutely.

26:08.786 --> 26:10.286
Okay. Shall we?

26:13.124 --> 26:17.159
So, what is the point of this meeting?

26:18.396 --> 26:19.662
Intimidation?

26:19.731 --> 26:22.732
Word on the street is that
you're starting from scratch.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.767
You really wanna go up against me?

26:25.937 --> 26:27.536
I pose the same question to you.

26:27.605 --> 26:29.004
In fact, here's my offer.

26:29.073 --> 26:32.208
I focus on the candy trade,
you focus on the prison.

26:32.276 --> 26:35.745
You stay out of my way,
and I stay out of yours.

26:35.813 --> 26:37.146
Huh.

26:37.215 --> 26:38.314
That's interesting.

26:39.517 --> 26:41.684
My daughter made the same pitch.

26:41.753 --> 26:43.285
But I'm afraid
that won't be an option.

26:44.555 --> 26:47.123
Well, in that case,

26:47.191 --> 26:49.658
Hiram, there is something
you need to know.

26:49.727 --> 26:50.659
Daddy,

26:51.963 --> 26:53.162
I've been thinking.

26:55.833 --> 26:59.402
If you agree to this scenario,
I could get behind that.

26:59.470 --> 27:02.838
Help you, just like
you've always wanted.

27:05.376 --> 27:07.810
It's what the family needs right now.

27:08.579 --> 27:09.545
Everybody wins.

27:14.018 --> 27:15.217
Okay.

27:15.286 --> 27:17.887
I'll focus on my prison,
you'll run the streets.

27:17.955 --> 27:20.256
But I do need
a steady stream of prisoners

27:20.324 --> 27:22.291
to make this arrangement
worth my while.

27:23.261 --> 27:25.294
I guess your husband,

27:25.363 --> 27:27.763
the Sheriff,
can help me with that?

27:27.832 --> 27:29.231
Abso-freaking-lutely.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.369
And what about Madam Mayor?

27:33.438 --> 27:35.471
Is she going to be
a help or a hindrance?

27:35.540 --> 27:36.872
I wouldn't worry about that.

27:37.842 --> 27:39.208
She will not be a factor.

27:40.545 --> 27:41.644
Either way.

27:45.049 --> 27:49.051
Hi, I read the interview you
gave to <i> The Buffalo Beat.</i>

27:49.120 --> 27:50.920
Did you happen to be
a member of the Farm?

27:50.988 --> 27:52.621
<i>I'm not sure
how you got this number.</i>

27:52.690 --> 27:54.490
<i>I really don't appreciate
calls like this.</i>

27:54.559 --> 27:56.892
Yes, I understand.
I won't call again.

28:08.272 --> 28:09.772
Hello.

28:09.841 --> 28:11.474
<i>Yeah, did you call me,
and leave this number?</i>

28:11.542 --> 28:13.275
Yes, yes, um...

28:13.945 --> 28:16.078
My name is Betty Cooper.

28:17.682 --> 28:21.283
I have some questions for you
about the Farm.

28:21.352 --> 28:23.919
<i>I can't say anything over the
phone, they might be listening.</i>

28:24.922 --> 28:26.789
Will you meet me in person?

28:26.858 --> 28:29.158
<i>It would need to be
somewhere private.</i>

28:29.227 --> 28:30.426
<i>Away from prying eyes.</i>

28:31.395 --> 28:32.695
I have the perfect spot.

28:32.763 --> 28:35.231
How soon can you be in Riverdale?

28:35.299 --> 28:36.699
<i>Glad you decided to show, Archie.</i>

28:37.401 --> 28:38.367
Wise man.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.836
Yeah.

28:40.905 --> 28:42.371
But I'm not taking the fall, Elio.

28:43.441 --> 28:45.174
What are you trying
to prove, Archie?

28:45.243 --> 28:48.077
Go down in round three like we
decided, and everyone walks out happy.

28:48.145 --> 28:49.578
And in one piece.

28:56.888 --> 28:58.087
Deal's off.

29:00.191 --> 29:01.390
You heard the man.

29:02.026 --> 29:02.992
Kill him.

29:10.403 --> 29:11.635
How did it go with the Ghoulies?

29:13.372 --> 29:15.572
They don't exist anymore.

29:15.641 --> 29:17.041
They're part of
the Gargoyles now.

29:17.109 --> 29:19.076
Same guys, different mask.
Did you recruit 'em?

29:19.145 --> 29:21.278
No, I'll find another way
to save the Serpents.

29:22.715 --> 29:23.781
Gargoyles aren't the answer.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.182
I don't want 'em
anywhere near us.

29:26.218 --> 29:27.317
They, uh...

29:28.587 --> 29:30.154
They're so deep into G&G.

29:31.757 --> 29:33.524
It's like they're lost in a jungle.

29:33.592 --> 29:36.760
Take it easy, boy,
get some food in you.

29:36.829 --> 29:38.829
<i>Thank you for meeting
me so quickly, Martha.</i>

29:39.665 --> 29:41.565
The Farm had places like this.

29:41.634 --> 29:42.866
Secret places.

29:43.502 --> 29:45.002
Hidey-holes.

29:45.071 --> 29:46.637
When did you leave the Farm?

29:46.706 --> 29:48.005
Six years ago.

29:49.542 --> 29:51.942
My sister Marigold and I
had joined at the same time.

29:52.778 --> 29:54.411
I ran away.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.014
I left the Farm,
right after she died.

29:58.017 --> 29:59.183
I'm so sorry.

30:02.121 --> 30:04.855
- How?
- It happened during one of their ceremonies.

30:06.859 --> 30:08.358
What kind of ceremony?

30:08.427 --> 30:11.295
The Farm believes that if you
can get close enough to death,

30:11.363 --> 30:12.596
you'll see the truth.

30:12.665 --> 30:15.265
They claim that you have
to survive an extreme ordeal

30:15.334 --> 30:17.201
in order to achieve ascension.

30:18.738 --> 30:20.304
What?

30:20.372 --> 30:22.339
What do...
What do you mean, "ascension"?

30:22.408 --> 30:24.308
The promise of the Farm.

30:24.376 --> 30:27.711
And the first step
towards it is the Baptism.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.113
"Baptism."

30:29.181 --> 30:31.582
My sister drowned during hers.

30:32.451 --> 30:33.383
Oh, my God.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.587
I have to go.
I'll be in touch.

30:58.244 --> 31:00.010
Okay, remember what I told you.

31:00.079 --> 31:02.179
Ronson's not used to fighting his way
out of the third round, all right?

31:02.248 --> 31:06.350
So keep moving, work the jabs, circle away
from his power, and stay off the ropes.

31:06.418 --> 31:09.586
He's gonna gas himself out, and you're
gonna knock him over like a bag of flour.

31:09.655 --> 31:11.722
- Second's out.
- All right, attaboy, kid. Let's go.

31:32.812 --> 31:35.913
Mom, it's Betty,
please call me back.

32:06.946 --> 32:09.079
You're doing great. All right?
He know you're hurt.

32:09.148 --> 32:11.215
He's going to try to end it
in this round, all right.

32:11.283 --> 32:12.716
We're gonna use that
to your advantage though.

32:12.785 --> 32:14.751
He's gonna slip that
right hand, all right,

32:14.820 --> 32:16.220
and you're gonna catch him
with the uppercut.

32:21.927 --> 32:24.228
Now get in there, make him pay.

32:27.433 --> 32:28.699
Attaboy!

32:35.808 --> 32:38.308
Go, Archie! You got this!

32:40.246 --> 32:41.945
Come on, Randy.
Come on, Randy.

32:42.014 --> 32:43.547
Come on, do it, Archie.

32:43.616 --> 32:44.781
Come on, come on.

32:44.850 --> 32:46.516
Stay on him, Arch, stay on him.

32:46.919 --> 32:47.951
Attaboy.

32:48.020 --> 32:49.686
Don't let up, don't let up.

32:54.293 --> 32:55.626
Come on.

33:03.903 --> 33:05.535
You're doing great.

33:05.604 --> 33:09.773
This is it. No matter what happens,
you've done great, all right?

33:09.842 --> 33:12.976
If you wanna win this fight,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

33:13.045 --> 33:14.544
You're gonna go for the KO.

33:14.613 --> 33:15.712
I can do it.

33:15.781 --> 33:17.080
He's getting tired.

33:17.149 --> 33:19.917
Okay, you got three minutes.

33:19.985 --> 33:22.319
Choose your point,
put him on the canvas.

33:24.323 --> 33:26.390
Come on, let's go.

33:31.363 --> 33:32.296
Whoo!

33:32.364 --> 33:33.363
Good boy, Archie.

33:33.432 --> 33:35.599
Come on.
Go after him, go after him.

33:36.068 --> 33:37.601
Whoo!

33:38.637 --> 33:39.603
Do it.

33:40.839 --> 33:43.006
Do it. Stay on him.
Stay on him.

33:43.075 --> 33:44.574
Attaboy.

33:46.045 --> 33:47.744
Whoo!

33:56.422 --> 34:00.357
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a split decision.

34:00.426 --> 34:03.460
Judge Williams scores,
8 to 7, Ronson.

34:05.898 --> 34:10.233
Judge Anderson scores,
9 to 6, Andrews.

34:11.603 --> 34:14.004
And Judge Patterson scores,

34:14.072 --> 34:18.675
8 to 7 for your winner and
still undefeated welterweight,

34:18.744 --> 34:24.214
Randy Van Ronson.

34:24.283 --> 34:27.117
Keep your head up, Arch.
You won the fight, no doubt in my mind.

34:35.293 --> 34:37.127
<i>Happy day, friends.</i>

34:37.196 --> 34:40.597
We are gathered here tonight
to celebrate the baptizing

34:41.199 --> 34:42.632
of Alice Smith.

34:44.436 --> 34:47.137
Now this is a day
of rebirth, of course.

34:47.206 --> 34:51.875
And as such, it is important to
remember that birth is no easy feat.

34:51.944 --> 34:55.012
It is a trauma to leave
the comfort of our wombs.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.814
We push, tear, and spring forth,

34:57.883 --> 35:01.852
crying and gasping for air,
for life.

35:06.859 --> 35:08.492
Today, Alice Smith,

35:08.560 --> 35:10.894
you will rip off the weight
you have carried,

35:10.963 --> 35:13.597
you will break through
the barriers restraining you,

35:13.665 --> 35:17.200
and you will emerge into
the light of your destiny.

35:17.770 --> 35:19.136
Are you ready?

35:21.073 --> 35:22.139
I am.

35:24.309 --> 35:26.877
Then may the one become many.

35:26.945 --> 35:28.712
And the many, one.

36:05.884 --> 36:07.017
Stop!

36:07.086 --> 36:09.853
Stop.

36:09.922 --> 36:11.088
Get off of her.

36:13.192 --> 36:14.224
Help me.

36:20.432 --> 36:22.299
She's not breathing.

36:22.367 --> 36:23.633
Polly, she's...

36:23.702 --> 36:24.935
Oh, my God.

36:25.003 --> 36:27.270
Somebody, call
an ambulance, please.

36:45.557 --> 36:47.290
You're okay. You're okay.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.595
It's okay.

37:01.515 --> 37:05.016
Ah, well, so much for not
messing up your pretty face.

37:05.085 --> 37:06.718
Yeah.

37:07.854 --> 37:09.187
How was your show?

37:09.256 --> 37:10.588
Oh, I killed it.

37:12.025 --> 37:13.491
Like you did here.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.361
I guess you decided
not to throw the fight.

37:18.265 --> 37:21.366
Oh, well, it's a win in my book.

37:25.105 --> 37:28.706
Do you wanna maybe
go get a milkshake at Pop's,

37:28.775 --> 37:30.208
to celebrate?

37:32.512 --> 37:34.446
Unless you have a better idea.

38:11.985 --> 38:15.520
Well, the Governor finally
returned my phone calls.

38:15.589 --> 38:17.989
And I had the most fascinating
conversation with him.

38:19.326 --> 38:21.125
What did Donald have to say?

38:23.630 --> 38:24.596
It's funny.

38:25.932 --> 38:30.201
He informed me that you made
a contribution to him

38:30.270 --> 38:32.337
not a day after I was shot.

38:32.405 --> 38:36.708
Around the same time that you were
getting rid of my business holdings.

38:39.079 --> 38:41.179
Anything you'd like
to share,<i> mi vida?</i>

38:43.617 --> 38:45.183
- Daddy.
- Stop!

38:49.623 --> 38:51.189
- Hiram...
- It was me.

38:53.693 --> 38:56.528
I burned your drugs
and equipment.

38:59.599 --> 39:03.034
Mom was just covering for me
with that story about the Feds.

39:03.103 --> 39:07.238
And I'm not going to apologize for it.
I did it for us.

39:08.675 --> 39:09.874
For all of us.

39:15.749 --> 39:16.681
Well,

39:17.617 --> 39:20.218
you owe me $75,000, Veronica.

39:21.755 --> 39:23.388
That's how much you burned away.

39:29.896 --> 39:31.062
Fine.

39:32.566 --> 39:34.065
I can live with that.

39:41.541 --> 39:42.774
Gargoyles.

39:42.842 --> 39:44.242
Jellybean.

39:44.311 --> 39:45.510
It's okay, kids.

39:46.179 --> 39:47.111
Stand down.

39:47.881 --> 39:49.581
What the hell is this?

39:49.649 --> 39:50.615
Are they with you?

39:50.684 --> 39:52.116
I did what you couldn't.

39:53.453 --> 39:55.053
Take off those stupid masks.

40:01.461 --> 40:02.660
This is a bad idea.

40:02.729 --> 40:06.464
Sweetheart, sometimes
beggars can't be choosers.

40:06.533 --> 40:09.133
I know you guys will find
a way to work together.

40:09.202 --> 40:12.537
Well, we're gonna need all the manpower
we can get to take this town back.

40:13.340 --> 40:14.606
Trust me.

40:16.009 --> 40:18.643
- God, she's not answering.
- Who isn't?

40:18.712 --> 40:20.144
This woman who escaped
from the Farm.

40:20.213 --> 40:22.280
I wanted her to tell you
what she told me,

40:22.349 --> 40:24.215
which is that
they're dangerous, Mom.

40:27.887 --> 40:30.555
I don't know
what you remember, Mom.

40:30.624 --> 40:34.058
But Polly held you underwater.

40:34.127 --> 40:35.893
They didn't let you come up.

40:35.962 --> 40:37.795
They tried to kill you, Mom.

40:37.864 --> 40:39.130
No, Betty.

40:41.501 --> 40:43.568
I was reborn.

40:46.106 --> 40:48.139
I saw it all.

40:50.543 --> 40:52.243
My purpose.

40:53.647 --> 40:54.979
My destiny.

40:55.048 --> 40:56.648
Just like the Farm promised.

40:56.716 --> 40:58.583
Just like Edgar said.

41:01.821 --> 41:04.122
Mom, no.

41:04.190 --> 41:05.890
And now that I've been baptized,

41:05.959 --> 41:09.293
I can finally purge the last thing in
my life that's been holding me back.

41:10.196 --> 41:11.329
Which is what?

41:12.232 --> 41:13.464
This house.

41:15.468 --> 41:17.035
I'm gonna sell this house.

41:17.103 --> 41:18.870
We're gonna all be together.

41:21.374 --> 41:22.306
You.

41:23.109 --> 41:24.008
Me.

41:24.944 --> 41:26.678
Polly, the twins.

41:27.614 --> 41:29.814
Edgar, Evelyn,

41:29.883 --> 41:31.282
the Farm.

41:32.218 --> 41:33.484
All one.

41:35.055 --> 41:36.020
Together.

41:37.123 --> 41:39.490
Forever and ever.
