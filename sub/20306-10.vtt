WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:06.506
-(noisy chatter)
-Item eight. Item eight!

00:06.589 --> 00:09.509
Past fires are notified,
Mike Belker's on an arson undercover

00:09.592 --> 00:13.221
in the alleys adjacent
to the Biltmore Arms, 117th and Dekker.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.515
We think some of the vagrant bums there
might be causing

00:15.598 --> 00:17.976
the... the garbage fires in the area.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.021
Item nine. Oh, yeah, Division reminds you

00:21.104 --> 00:24.315
that Christmas shopping season
is fast upon us.

00:24.566 --> 00:29.446
This year, all authorized
Unified Charity Santa Clauses

00:29.529 --> 00:32.282
are gonna be issued
this, uh, plastic lapel shield.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.702
Uh, any Santa caught soliciting
without it is in violation.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.663
It ain't against the law
to dress up like Santa.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.207
Gotta have this pin
you wanna make a buck off it.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.751
Now, that's the Christmas spirit.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.586
Uh, item ten.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.174
Division-wide reinstatement
of the vehicle inspection program.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.134
One team of officers to each precinct.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.511
-(all groaning)
-Might as well complain about--

00:53.595 --> 00:54.888
This is progress.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.390
Now, the winners of today's lottery

00:57.474 --> 00:59.934
to be working Jefferson
north of the overpass

01:00.018 --> 01:02.479
are, uh, officers Renko and Hill.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.773
-(all yelling)
-Come on, Sarge!

01:04.856 --> 01:06.691
(hooting)

01:06.775 --> 01:09.486
That's right, Joe Coffey,
kick a man when he's down. Go on.

01:10.070 --> 01:14.365
Item 11. P.B.A. informs you

01:15.241 --> 01:18.620
today is the last day
for the dental care option

01:18.703 --> 01:20.997
on your health care plan,
which as you know,

01:21.539 --> 01:25.502
requires a 51 percent
sign-up or the option's waived.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.837
-People!
-(smacks table)

01:28.546 --> 01:30.757
You don't sign up, we all lose.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.511
And that goes double for those of us
on the back nine of life.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.013
Uh, what's the signature
worth to you, Sarge?

01:38.098 --> 01:41.101
-That's the attitude I'm talking about.
-(laughter)

01:41.184 --> 01:43.770
You think you're never gonna
get old, Detective, huh?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.899
The day's gonna come when your gums
gonna start rotting out on you.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.318
-(laughter)
-You'll be sitting in a chair,

01:50.401 --> 01:53.696
and the dentist will say,
"I'm sorry Mr. LaRue, but it's bad news,"

01:53.780 --> 01:56.574
and you're gonna say,
"If only I'd listened to the sarge."

01:57.158 --> 01:58.868
I'll be taking names upstairs.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.330
Let's roll! Let's get out there.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.290
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.042
(all chattering)

02:06.126 --> 02:09.879
It's 23 degrees, about minus-12
with the wind chill factor.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.257
This job's got about as much dignity--

02:12.340 --> 02:14.634
-I can't take it.
-I can't listen to it all day.

02:14.717 --> 02:18.388
-Then put on ear muffs.
-Leo, let me have cones and some flares.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.057
I'm gonna offer cash money
to anybody'll take this shift.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.226
-Cash money.
-Garibaldi. Hey.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.520
Shooting, 333 Riverpark Way.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.982
People, people, before you head out,
who am I gonna get to sign this?

02:29.274 --> 02:32.026
Neal, how 'bout it? Pound of prevention.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.447
What's a couple extra bucks a month?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.158
Yo, Stewart, get over here.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.826
Oh, hey, Sarge.

02:40.493 --> 02:45.165
You never heard the expression "a pound
of prevention is worth a pound of cure"?

02:45.248 --> 02:46.833
You're barking up the wrong tree, Sarge.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.794
You gotta realize,
the dentist is your ally.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.589
-Sarge--
-No, he is the ally of your teeth.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.924
-Sarge--
-Plus, with this insurance company

02:55.008 --> 02:57.051
backing you up,
you'll make a team that can't be beat.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.678
-Put out your hand, sir.
-What for?

03:02.265 --> 03:03.850
Okay? Enough already?

03:04.350 --> 03:05.476
Satisfied?

03:06.519 --> 03:08.563
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:10.648
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:10.732 --> 03:14.569
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:14.652 --> 03:16.237
(sirens wailing)

03:21.701 --> 03:24.329
(theme music playing)

04:42.115 --> 04:42.949
LUCY: What do we got here?

04:43.574 --> 04:46.577
Uh, kid came in through the window,
lady took him out.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.998
-Did you notify relatives?
-No, that's in the works.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.709
Mrs. Minot, you have to come down
to make a formal statement.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.294
The detectives here will finish up.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.254
What for? I told you how it happened.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.214
-Just procedure, ma'am.
-Oh.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.967
-LUCY: So where's the shotgun?
-HARRY: It's over there, Joe's got it.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.387
-Let me know what you need.
-S.I.D. lift anything?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.513
There's no fingerprints yet.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.473
There's a couple of skid marks
on the sill.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.392
MRS. MINOT: I just knew
it was going to happen...

05:09.475 --> 05:10.643
Looks like shoe polish.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.353
MRS. MINOT:
I've been telling the building manager

05:12.437 --> 05:14.355
to install locks on the windows.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.066
They don't even have locks
on the double doors downstairs.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.943
And I think that's just shameful.

05:19.902 --> 05:20.945
Off the toes?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.908
Just the other day,
Mrs. Dennison from upstairs

05:25.992 --> 05:28.161
was raped by one of these animals.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.414
And right in the middle of the afternoon,
if you could imagine such a thing.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.791
I, myself, was robbed just two weeks ago.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.502
I know what I'm talking about.
You gotta listen to me.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.839
WOMAN: Here she comes.
We were so worried about you, dear.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.632
-Are you all right?
-Oh, I'm fine.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.594
Oh, God bless you,
Mary Minot, you're a hero.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.262
Oh, fiddle had to do with it.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.017
JOE: Hey, Harry.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.482
Guy says that he saw something.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.986
I live in the building.
I know that boy's family.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.237
'Kay, what's your name, sir?

06:04.697 --> 06:05.907
Ramon Cassiano.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.286
Look, that old woman...
is a stone killer, man.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.662
She set it up.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.082
Y'all drive careful, now.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.338
-Come on, it's freezing out here.
-I'd like to take tickets out of the car.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.715
I don't think it's that much,
but if you say so, okay.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.093
-Were gonna have to take you in then, pal.
-Look...

06:25.885 --> 06:28.638
Guys, cut me a little slack.
I got a very important man.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.349
I don't care if it's the Queen of Sheba,
you're under arrest.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.226
All right, you have the right to remain
silent.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.227
If you give up that right...

06:34.310 --> 06:37.355
-What's the delay?
-My, my, my.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.733
It's Paul the Wall.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.320
Mr. Srignoli, they say we owe
300 dollars in traffic tickets.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.118
Pay 'em. I'll throw in a bonus.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.828
You know that's not the way it's done.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.790
Remember me to your lovely wives.
Get something nice.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.543
Fat man, you just waded
knee-deep into dog business.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.587
-You're busted.
-For what? For paying my fine?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.298
-For bribery. Get out of the car.
-Oh, come on.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.551
-No one needs this.
-All right, you both have the right

07:06.634 --> 07:09.095
-to remain silent.
-No one needs trouble, am I right?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.639
Anything you say can and will be held

07:11.722 --> 07:13.391
-against you...
-I got one thing to say to you,

07:14.434 --> 07:15.977
Ed Greenglass.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.230
-(grunting)
-You have the right to speak to attorney.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.357
Bobby, we're gonna have to call a van.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.693
I can't even get this guy's hands
behind to put the cuffs on him.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.154
(laughing) All right, you have the right
to speak with an attorney...

07:26.237 --> 07:28.614
Ain't no way this lard bucket's
gonna fit into a unit.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.200
This hotshot lawyer
gets 200 bucks an hour.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.827
And he eats nobodies like you.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.455
You look like you ate this limousine
for breakfast, pal.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.497
Now, get moving.

07:37.748 --> 07:41.627
REPORTER: There she is. Mrs. Minot,
can we have a statement, please?

07:41.711 --> 07:42.712
REPORTER 2: Can we get a picture?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.214
-(reporters clamoring)
-This way, Mrs. Minot.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.216
Will I be able to talk
to those reporters later?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.218
-Yes, as soon as we're done here.
-Oh.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.720
-If you'll just have a seat right here.
-Here?

07:50.803 --> 07:51.804
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank you, dear.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.722
I'll be right back.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.682
-All right, dear.
-Captain?

07:56.017 --> 07:59.103
-About this shooting with the old lady.
-What about it?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.856
She says her son's
City Councilman Detweiler.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.483
-Okay, just wait right here.
-Has he been notified?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.776
Says she asked a neighbor to call.
Thought you ought to know.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.653
Yeah, well there's something
else you should know, Captain.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.031
We got a witness here who
claims she murdered the kid.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.369
She puts the TV on the sill
in front of the window,

08:15.453 --> 08:18.206
and she leaves the window open.
In this weather?

08:18.706 --> 08:22.752
So I tell her, "Mrs. Minot,
you're asking for trouble with this."

08:23.294 --> 08:26.130
And she says to me,
anyone tries to rob her again,

08:26.214 --> 08:27.590
they're gonna get what they deserve.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.927
Mrs. Minot was burglarized two weeks ago.

08:31.636 --> 08:35.056
There's a neighbor lady
says Minot told her she was gonna, quote,

08:35.139 --> 08:36.807
"settle the hash of these people."

08:36.891 --> 08:39.060
She keeps the gun out beside her chair.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.437
-I've seen it.
-Yeah, it's a 12-gauge,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.231
so it's not exactly a squirrel gun.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.399
Plus, if you don't know,

08:45.483 --> 08:48.319
she did the exact same thing
three years ago.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.615
-Killed a man in her apartment.
-Is that true?

08:53.032 --> 08:55.284
Well, she lives in the Corridor.
I got a call in to the Heights.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.788
We're getting a full statement
right now from Mrs. Minot.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.250
Follow up with the Heights.
Thank You Mr. Cassiano

09:02.875 --> 09:04.085
I knew him!

09:04.794 --> 09:07.713
This was a boy she killed, maybe fourteen.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.510
Councilman Detweiler?

09:13.469 --> 09:14.845
Officer Hill, how are you guys doing?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.931
-Morning.
-What the hell happened?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.849
I get a phone call, some hysterical woman,

09:18.933 --> 09:21.018
saying my mother walked in on some punk

09:21.102 --> 09:22.603
ransacking her apartment.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.980
Walked in and killed him, Councilman.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.692
I'm aware of that, Frank.
Is she all right?

09:27.984 --> 09:28.859
Seems so.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.820
(sighs)

09:32.655 --> 09:34.657
Lord, that woman is a rock.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.325
Where is she, can I see her?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.369
In interrogation, giving a statement.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.540
I don't know,
I've told her time and time again

09:42.623 --> 09:44.250
to get out of that neighborhood.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.919
How do we protect our elderly?

09:47.795 --> 09:49.505
Some of our elderly don't need protection.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.424
Frank.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.052
I want to thank you
and your people for all you're doing.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.183
And I know we've had
our differences, but for me,

10:01.267 --> 10:02.893
it's water under the bridge.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.568
Captain, Heights confirms.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.654
Attempted burglary,
Minot's apartment, three years ago July.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.031
Same weapon same result.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.991
-Guy was blown away.
-How was it ruled?

10:17.074 --> 10:18.868
Self-defense, justifiable.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.453
And Captain...

10:23.748 --> 10:26.292
we found shoe polish residue
on the windowsill,

10:26.375 --> 10:28.794
and scuff marks on the toes
of the kid's shoes,

10:29.253 --> 10:31.464
like maybe the body was dragged
in through the window.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.259
We got a problem here, gentlemen?

10:36.552 --> 10:40.181
I'm Ed Greenglass,
representing Mr. Srignoli.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.642
I checked the holding facilities here.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.684
They're not adequate.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.144
Place is a pit.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.147
Due to my client's physical condition,

10:48.230 --> 10:50.232
I'm urging release, pending arraignment.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.194
This is a man
with an elaborate medical history.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.363
He'd had bypass surgery, he's asthmatic--

10:55.446 --> 10:57.573
Wait a minute, didn't you try
this two years ago,

10:57.657 --> 10:58.699
the State Supreme Court?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.034
They wheeled him in on a dolly.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.703
I had two doctors testify I had phlebitis.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.205
My whole leg swelled up like a balloon

11:04.288 --> 11:06.666
-It's a balloon now, bud.
-Come on, gentlemen!

11:06.957 --> 11:10.461
We have a special set of cells
for occasions such as this.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.673
Schnitz, take Mr. Srignoli to the garden.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.633
Wait a minute, I get nuts in tight spaces.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.301
I can't stand feeling confined.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.761
Read a magazine.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.472
I don't have to take this
from you little clowns.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.391
You toads have been
in my face all morning.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.517
Come on, Mr. Srignoli.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.435
When I get through suing this department,

11:26.519 --> 11:29.063
there won't be a brick,
there will be a piece of pipe.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.690
This the kind of place that gets bombed.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.651
Listen, blimpo, I don't care
who you are on the street,

11:33.734 --> 11:35.236
you don't come in here and talk that way.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.029
I need to control myself here.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.572
I'm not supposed to get worked up.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.950
I got violets to cover your face.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.119
Why don't you go downstairs,
get yourself a comb.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.581
(train clattering overhead)

11:49.750 --> 11:51.836
(men muttering)

12:25.369 --> 12:26.454
Who are you?

12:27.663 --> 12:28.497
Huh?

12:31.500 --> 12:32.585
I asked you a question.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.630
What do you think this is, a park?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.132
Anyone can just walk in here?

12:38.215 --> 12:39.925
-Shut up.
-He stepped on my foot!

12:40.009 --> 12:43.095
Why don't you suck
on your jug and shut up.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.222
You got a pay rent.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.018
People can't just drift in here for free.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.854
What's rent?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.566
What you got, huh? Food?

12:56.317 --> 12:57.777
You got food? You got cigarettes?

12:57.860 --> 13:04.283
-Huh? What do you got in your pockets?
-Take your filthy hooks outta my clothes!

13:05.826 --> 13:08.496
Okay? Okay!

13:10.164 --> 13:13.125
This is my alley now,
do you understand me?

13:15.002 --> 13:17.379
You behave yourselves,
maybe I will let you stay.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.507
We're sorry. We're very sorry.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.009
-We ain't gonna--
-Shut up. Get up.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.552
-Get up! Get up!
-We apologize.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.595
(yells)

13:24.678 --> 13:26.388
(laughing)

13:27.097 --> 13:28.682
Our alley now, punk.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.652
-It's 302! You just tell him to stop!
-(woman screaming)

13:40.903 --> 13:42.780
-COFFEY: Sounds terrible.
-She's been screaming like that.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.697
Open up!

13:45.574 --> 13:47.368
WOMAN: He's crazy! He's crazy!

13:47.451 --> 13:50.162
We're police officers.
We've had a complaint, Flowers!

13:50.246 --> 13:52.039
-Let us in!
-MAN: Get away from the door, Daniel!

13:52.122 --> 13:54.458
-(woman sobbing)
-Shut the door, Daniel!

13:54.542 --> 13:57.127
-Listen to me. Put that can down!
-Shut it!

13:57.211 --> 13:59.296
-He's got gas all over the place!
-I'm gonna light her on fire!

13:59.380 --> 14:01.257
-I'll set her on fire!
-Okay, okay. All right, all right!

14:01.340 --> 14:02.216
Don't do it!

14:03.259 --> 14:04.718
-Call for backup.
-(woman screaming)

14:04.802 --> 14:07.346
(siren wailing)

14:09.515 --> 14:13.102
Mr. Flowers won't identify
an agenda, Frank.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.646
He's going on about this guy, Ortiz,

14:16.188 --> 14:18.232
supermarket manager
who canned him last week.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.025
FLOWERS: I want Ortiz!

14:20.109 --> 14:22.069
-Alert the firemen.
-FLOWERS: Bring me Ortiz!

14:22.152 --> 14:24.530
We talked to him.
No, Ortiz won't come down.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.865
He's scared to death of the guy.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.449
Where are you, Ortiz?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.076
-(woman screams)
-Gotta go, Frank.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.787
-FLOWERS: Get these people away from here!
-Frank...

14:31.871 --> 14:34.582
He's doused his entire apartment
with gasoline.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.334
He's carrying a woman around,
and it looks like she's soaked, too.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.963
-(radio chatter)
-No, no, if we try to make a shot,

14:41.046 --> 14:42.798
I think the whole room will go up.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.009
(Flowers continues shouting, indistinct)

14:45.426 --> 14:46.427
Talk to you later, Frank.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.764
Ortiz said burn it all!

14:51.265 --> 14:53.809
I'm sure Mr. Ortiz doesn't want that,
Mr. Flowers.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.605
Well, you don't know him like I do.
You don't understand!

14:57.688 --> 15:01.901
-You don't understand!
-Okay. Okay, Mr. Flowers.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.195
At least... at least send your son out.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.489
You don't want him to get hurt, do you?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.199
WOMAN: Won't somebody help me.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.827
-Help me, somebody!
-HENRY: I know you don't want that.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.955
Mr. Flowers, would you
pick up the phone, please?

15:15.039 --> 15:17.082
I want to talk to you on the phone,
I'm gonna go there right now.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.709
All right, pick it up, please.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.177
Mr. Flowers? Okay, there you go.
There you go.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.139
Now, listen, Mr. Flowers,
if you don't want your son to get hurt,

15:32.973 --> 15:34.266
why don't you send him
out of the apartment

15:34.350 --> 15:36.518
-and I'll send someone upstairs--
-(woman screaming)

15:37.019 --> 15:41.231
Okay. Okay, Mr. Flowers,
no one's coming upstairs.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.818
Mr. Flowers, you understand me?
No one's coming up.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.572
-Mr. Flowers?
-(screaming continues)

15:52.034 --> 15:57.373
(siren wailing)

16:03.420 --> 16:06.298
-(gun fires)
-(laughs) A hell of a kick!

16:06.382 --> 16:08.592
Idiot! Dope!

16:10.886 --> 16:13.222
Are we gonna roll this guy or what?

16:17.309 --> 16:18.769
-Hey.
-(Mick groans)

16:20.521 --> 16:22.064
-Hey!
-(groans)

16:23.023 --> 16:24.733
(whistles)

16:26.235 --> 16:28.070
Back amongst the living, eh?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.490
I bet you're gonna wish you were dead.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.411
I'm a police officer.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.455
Oh! Where-where's your badge?

16:38.747 --> 16:40.749
Huh? Where's your gun?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.544
Where's your hat? Where's your ears?

16:43.627 --> 16:45.212
(laughing)

16:45.295 --> 16:47.589
(yells)

16:49.341 --> 16:51.760
(yelling)

16:54.013 --> 16:57.016
(panting)

17:03.856 --> 17:05.524
(groans)

17:10.863 --> 17:12.489
(coughing)

17:13.741 --> 17:16.910
There's cops coming looking for me.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.663
You're all going to jail!

17:20.456 --> 17:22.041
I wanna hear you say it.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.753
Say, "I'm in trouble now."

17:28.505 --> 17:29.548
-Say it!
-(groans)

17:30.883 --> 17:32.301
Say it!

17:33.677 --> 17:34.762
Say it!

17:34.845 --> 17:35.929
(coughs)

17:38.474 --> 17:39.641
Say it.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.019
(singsong) Say it.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.395
-(groaning) I'm...
-Huh?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.399
-I'm...
-Uh-huh? Eh?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.443
I'm telling you...

17:49.943 --> 17:51.320
for the last time.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.698
I'm telling you for the last time!

17:55.324 --> 17:56.784
You think I wouldn't, huh?

17:57.493 --> 18:00.412
-I've killed guys.
-Easy, easy.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.663
I want his shoes.

18:03.832 --> 18:04.917
Take all you need.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.134
Oh, no. No!

18:15.511 --> 18:16.345
(groans)

18:28.315 --> 18:30.484
Now you know what's what, huh?

18:32.569 --> 18:34.113
You ain't no cop, now.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.785
SID confirms the polish on the sills
are a match to the kid's shoes.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.703
There's enough blood and tissue
on the fire escape

18:41.787 --> 18:44.123
to definitely support
that he was shot outside the window,

18:44.206 --> 18:46.208
So she dragged him inside?
This little old lady?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.961
He's reaching for the TV,
she fires, he falls over the sill.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.046
He wasn't very big.
All she has to do is yank him.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.090
Add the statement she made to Cassiano,

18:53.173 --> 18:55.175
the neighbor woman, the previous shooting,

18:55.259 --> 18:57.010
we have a makeable case here Irwin.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.512
If we don't charge we're derelict.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.433
(sighs)

19:05.978 --> 19:07.896
-Your decision, Frank.
-Charge.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.190
So much for my political future.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.653
MRS. MINOT: Of course,
I understand completely.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.779
Thank you, my dear.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.992
Mrs. Minot, I'm Captain Furillo.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.368
Well, Captain, if your people

19:21.451 --> 19:23.203
are quite finished,
I'd like to go home now.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.497
First I'd like to talk to you
about this morning's shooting.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.583
Isn't it something?

19:27.666 --> 19:30.377
They come and go as bold you please.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.879
It is because they're on the drugs.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.214
It's the drugs that make them fearless.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.759
Mrs. Minot, we think maybe
you committed a crime.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.346
Well a crime was committed, sir,

19:41.805 --> 19:43.098
but by that man.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.767
-He broke into my apartment.
-I understand.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.937
There seems to be evidence
that indicates you set a trap for him.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.190
(laughs) Oh, that's ludicrous.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.776
I think you're very rude
to make these insinuations.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.112
Nevertheless, I'm afraid
we're going to have to arrest you.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.156
Oh, I demand to see a lawyer.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.409
I won't stand for any more of this.
Not for one second.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.036
Now, where's my bag? You have my bag.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.622
Henry just called.
They got the supermarket manager

20:06.705 --> 20:08.081
on his way to the hotel.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.918
-Sarge?
-What?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.377
We got a situation going on downstairs.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.295
It's pretty bad.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.006
(cell door closes)

20:16.548 --> 20:17.716
LEO: Ambulance is on the way.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.055
One, two, three, four...

20:24.556 --> 20:27.226
It's Paul the Wall Srignoli, Captain.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.565
He's dead.

20:35.108 --> 20:35.943
Are you sure?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.195
As far as I'm concerned.

20:38.278 --> 20:42.324
-(cell door opens)
-Gets no more breath of life from me.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.826
Frank, Howard on line four.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.414
Mr. Flowers? Mr. Ortiz is here.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.833
And he wants to straighten
this whole thing out.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.753
He's come down here to talk
to you, Mr. Flowers,

20:54.836 --> 20:56.546
so if you'll pick up your phone now.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.633
Well, he's out of gasoline
and he threw the can out the window.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.510
We've got his former employer here.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.929
(helicopter hovering)

21:04.012 --> 21:07.808
Flowers seems to want to give it up,
but I'm afraid he's not gonna make it.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.769
(Flowers yelling, indistinct)

21:10.852 --> 21:12.271
HENRY: Please pick up the phone,
Mr. Flowers.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.606
FLOWERS: Don't make me do it!
Don't make me set--

21:14.690 --> 21:17.776
You understand, Mr. Ortiz,
apologize to him.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.945
Anything he wants,
you just agree with him.

21:20.028 --> 21:20.862
You go along with him.

21:25.325 --> 21:29.246
Mr. Flowers? This is Luis Ortiz.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.918
FLOWERS: No! No! No!

21:35.002 --> 21:39.965
Mr. Flowers, Mr. Ortiz wants to talk
to you and straighten this problem out.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.216
Why don't you pick up the phone.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.344
-FLOWERS: No more! No more!
-(static on phone)

21:44.428 --> 21:46.972
No more! No more!

21:47.055 --> 21:48.473
He picked up the phone, Henry.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.227
-That's not Ortiz!
-(screaming)

21:52.311 --> 21:55.897
That's not Ortiz! It's Satan!

21:55.981 --> 21:58.358
(indistinct chatter)

22:02.195 --> 22:04.614
Mr. Flowers? He set the curtains.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.657
Flowers?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.784
Blue Fox. Fox Leader. Kick it, kick it!

22:07.868 --> 22:08.702
Break it!

22:10.787 --> 22:12.622
(woman screaming)

22:12.706 --> 22:15.000
FLOWERS: No! That's my baby!

22:15.542 --> 22:19.129
I want to save my baby! Not my baby!

22:19.713 --> 22:22.341
-Where's the kid?
-I don't know, I don't see him!

22:23.550 --> 22:27.179
(Flowers yelling, indistinct)

22:27.262 --> 22:28.889
Come on, don't be afraid. It's okay.

22:28.972 --> 22:33.935
FLOWERS: No! No! Not my baby! Not my baby!

22:34.019 --> 22:35.520
HENRY: Lucy, get him out of here!

22:36.438 --> 22:38.065
All right people, let's get back here.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.524
(reporters clamoring)

22:39.608 --> 22:41.777
REPORTER: Flowers, why'd you do it?
How's your wife?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.445
REPORTER 2: Flowers, why did you do it?

22:45.113 --> 22:46.573
I want him on suicide watch.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.826
Councilman Detweiler?
Comments on the arrest of your mother?

22:49.910 --> 22:52.120
-Ah... no comment.
-What's your mother being charged with?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.872
I'll make a statement later, thank you.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.670
Who the hell do you think you are?

23:01.129 --> 23:02.297
You want close the door?

23:06.676 --> 23:09.388
I know we have history Furillo,
but I never thought you'd be laying for me

23:09.471 --> 23:13.183
all these years to take this kind of a...
a, a cheap cruel shot.

23:13.266 --> 23:16.019
Councilman, we believe
she premeditated a murder.

23:16.103 --> 23:20.148
Huh? Well, I'm blowing the whistle
on his whole charade right now.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.484
There's the punk's rap sheet.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.278
For B&amp;E's by the time he's 13.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.614
The victim's previous record
is not at issue here.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.742
A woman that age,
putting her through this.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.663
-The stress could kill her!
-We have grounds for arrest.

23:34.746 --> 23:38.291
Substantial forensics and a witness
who can provide motive and intent.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.336
Raymond Cassiano?

23:42.587 --> 23:43.588
There's your witness.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.299
A.K.A. Raymond Santiago.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.843
There's a bench warrant out against him,

23:48.135 --> 23:50.220
bail-jumping, the whole schmear.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.805
What kind of deal did you cut for Role?

23:51.888 --> 23:53.640
You scratching each other's back? Huh?

23:53.723 --> 23:55.350
I wasn't aware of this.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.855
-You railroading morons.
-(grabbing phone)

24:00.480 --> 24:03.942
-Sandbagging me, coming and going.
-(dialing)

24:04.025 --> 24:06.027
-Well she gets the best in the city.
-1981...

24:06.695 --> 24:09.573
-Malicious mischief. Failure to appear.
-This is Councilman Detweiler.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.869
You don't move on that warrant,
I'm sure Fletcher will be happy to.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.787
David? Arnie.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.291
No, I do understand
your department's position.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.084
please try to understand mine.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.337
(sighing)

24:25.255 --> 24:27.299
Okay. All right, thank you.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.887
Daniel, in a little while,

24:31.970 --> 24:33.763
you're going to the Juvenile Authority.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.850
I was just talking to the lady
on the phone and she sounds very nice.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.478
And you know,
they have other children there.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.022
What did my mom do wrong?

24:42.606 --> 24:45.150
-What?
-What did my mom do wrong?

24:45.817 --> 24:47.903
Your mother didn't
do anything wrong, sweetheart.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.655
My daddy said she was evil.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.950
Oh, Daniel, that's not true.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.828
He didn't mean that. She's not evil.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.413
It's just that...

24:58.997 --> 25:01.416
Well, your daddy's very sick right now.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.960
My daddy's not sick!
Don't say that about him!

25:04.044 --> 25:07.047
Don't say that about him!
He's got a man in him!

25:07.130 --> 25:09.633
-I'm all right.
-He said he had a man in him!

25:09.716 --> 25:12.010
Let me go! Let me go!

25:12.093 --> 25:14.054
-Let me go!
-Thank you, I'm all right.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.890
-Let me go!
-Let him go. Let him go!

25:29.819 --> 25:31.154
They'll be here soon, Daniel.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.406
So you just sit there quietly.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.117
And, uh...

25:36.409 --> 25:37.994
we'll see about getting you
something to eat.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.582
He used to keep the bodies in the ice.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.125
In the freezer.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.296
Not the bodies, their souls.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.842
-He'd trap them.
-JOYCE: Who did, Mr. Flowers?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.720
Ortiz. He's Satan.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.431
He won't admit it, but I know.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.230
'Cause he's in me, too.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.403
(voice strained) I tried to help them.

26:13.405 --> 26:18.076
(crying) You could see
the faces in the ice.

26:18.159 --> 26:20.453
Twisted, in pain.

26:23.915 --> 26:24.749
And...

26:25.834 --> 26:28.003
and when he tells me what to do...

26:29.170 --> 26:32.257
(sobbing) I... I have to do it.

26:35.010 --> 26:38.722
I-I have to be kept away.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.892
What do I have to do...

26:44.144 --> 26:45.687
to convince you?

26:50.358 --> 26:51.401
Did I hurt the boy?

26:52.277 --> 26:53.111
He's all right.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.741
They wanted him, too.

27:00.493 --> 27:03.830
They wanted to nest... inside him.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.375
They'd already taken my wife.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.966
That's why I needed... to burn her.

27:17.636 --> 27:22.223
(sobbing) Oh... Oh, God!

27:23.516 --> 27:25.393
What did I do?

27:27.479 --> 27:28.313
(soft thump)

27:29.230 --> 27:30.940
(sobbing)

27:38.406 --> 27:40.825
(crying)

27:47.999 --> 27:51.336
(both speaking Spanish)

27:51.419 --> 27:54.422
Uh, Frank. Frank, this is Mr. Alva.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.007
He asked to speak to you.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.886
Mr. Alva's son, Miguel,
he was killed this morning.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.639
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Alva.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.265
I have one question for you, sir.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.227
Is it true that my son was unarmed?

28:07.310 --> 28:09.312
-Well, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty--
-And is it true that this woman

28:09.396 --> 28:11.856
shot my boy outside her apartment?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.858
-That she left the window open?
-Mr. Alva--

28:13.942 --> 28:15.610
That she baited a trap?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.947
-I am told this is true.
-As I said, I'm afraid--

28:19.030 --> 28:22.242
That this woman murdered
my boy in cold blood?

28:22.325 --> 28:23.952
Well, that's up to a jury to decide.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.036
Jury?

28:25.912 --> 28:27.622
Am I to expect justice?

28:28.289 --> 28:32.210
A 73-year-old white woman?
The mother of a councilor?

28:32.502 --> 28:36.423
Mr. Alva, you can be assured
we will do our best.

28:36.506 --> 28:40.051
A Puerto Rican boy, with previous arrests?

28:41.010 --> 28:44.222
Can you honestly say
that I will get justice?

28:48.601 --> 28:50.437
I had to identify my son...

28:52.397 --> 28:53.732
by the color of his shirt.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.402
He had no face.

29:01.656 --> 29:05.076
(weeping) She slaughtered him,
do you understand?

29:05.493 --> 29:06.327
Mr. Alva.

29:11.332 --> 29:13.334
Mrs. Minot,
the police found no fingerprints

29:13.418 --> 29:14.878
on the outside of the window.

29:15.795 --> 29:16.629
So?

29:17.797 --> 29:19.340
It tends to support their contention

29:19.424 --> 29:21.384
that you deliberately
left the window open.

29:22.635 --> 29:23.470
So what if I did?

29:25.638 --> 29:27.432
Mrs. Minot, I must tell you,

29:27.515 --> 29:29.225
I'm developing a strong impression

29:29.309 --> 29:31.144
that you were the architect
of these events.

29:31.978 --> 29:34.564
Did you know that just two weeks ago,

29:34.647 --> 29:36.900
these drug fiends broke into my apartment?

29:37.984 --> 29:41.446
They stole my ring,
a silver picture frame.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.699
The police came, looked at the mess.

29:45.533 --> 29:46.785
"What a shame," they said.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.913
But what did they do about it?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.706
Not a thing.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.333
Mrs. Minot, the police--

29:53.416 --> 29:55.794
I have lived in that
apartment 30 years, missy.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.378
I've been a good neighbor to everyone.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.088
Puerto Ricans alike.

30:00.006 --> 30:03.551
And neither those animals
nor my son are forcing me out.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.261
That's my home.

30:06.763 --> 30:10.391
They rob, rape, kill!

30:11.267 --> 30:12.852
Same thing with the coloreds, I know.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.524
Did I bushwhack him? Mm?

30:19.651 --> 30:20.777
You bet I did.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.655
And I'd do it again.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.619
I must warn you,
you stand a chance of going to jail.

30:29.702 --> 30:30.537
(scoffs)

30:31.830 --> 30:34.082
I'm old. Frail.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.376
I was defending myself.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.421
My dear, they'll give me a medal.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.010
RENKO: You ain't never gonna get
that individual of that size

30:46.094 --> 30:47.512
out of that kind of confinement,

30:47.595 --> 30:49.931
mark my words, I'm telling you.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.726
Who was this guy, anyway?

30:53.810 --> 30:57.772
Heh. Spare no tears
for Paul the Wall Srignoli, Schnitz.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.400
Big-time shylock. Or he thought he was.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.819
Probably got a few
bodies buried somewhere.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.320
They never got him on any of them.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.823
NEAL (panting): Need a second
to catch my breath.

31:06.906 --> 31:07.824
How are we coming here?

31:09.075 --> 31:10.451
Not so good, Sarge.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.329
How does a guy let himself
bloat up like that?

31:14.414 --> 31:17.876
Absolutely no self-restraint,
none whatsoever.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.296
It's like Jonah swallowed the whale,
instead of the other way around.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.756
Yo. Joe Coffey.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.342
Hey, Sarge, I got a bum shoulder.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.595
Yeah, you see Nick Belker today?

31:28.678 --> 31:29.929
No, we were at the hostage scene.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.931
He hasn't checked in
we haven't been able to raise him.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.516
He's usually like clockwork.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.476
Ah... why don't you go out
and look for him.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.145
Either that or give us a hand here.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.062
Yeah, I'm on my way.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.733
Okay, everybody grab a piece.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.736
We got enough horses here.
We should be able to do it.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.571
-(grunting)
-Okay, get him out of there.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.865
(all grunting loudly)

31:48.948 --> 31:52.785
Okay, one, two, three.
Come on now, get him up.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.121
-(all grunting loudly)
-That's it, that's it!

31:55.204 --> 31:57.123
Okay, over here, turn him around.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.877
(all yelling)

32:00.960 --> 32:02.211
Yeah, okay, one more--

32:02.295 --> 32:03.838
One, two, three...

32:03.922 --> 32:05.506
(yelling)

32:05.590 --> 32:07.091
(laughter)

32:07.175 --> 32:10.511
Oh... That is a world record.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.305
Let's see the Russians beat that!

32:13.389 --> 32:14.682
Whoa!

32:15.600 --> 32:18.645
I tried to do the right thing!
You think I'd do it again?

32:28.655 --> 32:33.326
Excuse me.
This is Gina Srignoli. Paul's widow.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.787
She's here to see her husband.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.665
My sympathies, Mrs. Srignoli.

32:39.624 --> 32:40.541
Thank you.

32:43.127 --> 32:46.089
Things are a little hectic
around here today. But, Mrs.--

32:47.298 --> 32:49.258
-ED: Can I use your phone?
-Yeah.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.223
He wants to file a ten-million dollar
wrongful death suit against you.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.601
-Mrs. Srignoli?
-Yes?

32:59.185 --> 33:01.771
Hi, I'm Detective Harry Garibaldi.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.691
On behalf of all of us here,

33:04.774 --> 33:07.860
I'd just like to express
our deepest condolences.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.737
That's kind of you.

33:10.530 --> 33:15.118
I know that Paul wasn't always
on the best of terms with the police.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.037
So it's gratifying
to know he had a friend.

33:20.039 --> 33:23.626
Did you know that he talked
about you all the time?

33:23.918 --> 33:25.586
He never mentioned you.

33:26.212 --> 33:29.757
But then he liked to keep
his business affairs private.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.387
Why don't you let me
get you a cup of coffee

33:34.470 --> 33:36.597
and when they finish downstairs
they'll let us know.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.767
Okay. Um, was his death painful?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.811
Oh, no. Very sudden. Like that.
(snaps fingers)

33:42.729 --> 33:45.565
-Be still my heart.
-Who was that?

33:46.274 --> 33:47.400
The grieving widow.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.360
I've had it with widows.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.947
How does a girl like that wind up
with a creep like Srignoli?

33:53.031 --> 33:55.158
(chuckles) Maybe the man
had certain qualities.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.910
Look at Garibaldi.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.789
-NEAL: Hey, what's the problem, lover?
-That guy, he's a total sleaze.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.182
-LUCY: Hold on a second.
-You see something?

34:20.308 --> 34:21.517
No, nothing.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.700
That's it. That's Mick's car.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.285
Just pull in right behind.

34:40.912 --> 34:41.996
JOE: Maybe we should call it in.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.248
Let's take a look around first.
Somebody must've seen him.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.639
Hey. Hey, mister.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.265
How long you been sitting there?

35:03.851 --> 35:05.061
About seven years.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.522
The car parked there.
You see the guy driving it?

35:12.276 --> 35:14.112
You got something to say, you'd better
say it now or I'm running you in.

35:14.195 --> 35:17.198
Hey, let go, lady. I don't know anything.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.367
I heard a few things.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.494
-Yeah?
-Like what kind of things?

35:22.328 --> 35:25.706
Well, some of the guys
were boasting, you know, uh...

35:25.998 --> 35:27.792
Talking big about rolling some guy.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.878
-Where?
-In a place.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.172
You show us.

35:34.924 --> 35:37.760
-Cost ya.
-Yeah, two bucks. Come on.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.312
Mick?

35:50.064 --> 35:51.023
JOE: Mick Belker!

35:52.525 --> 35:54.193
-(rat squeaking)
-JOE: Ow!

36:08.916 --> 36:11.210
Oh, no. Mick.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.675
No. Don't look at me.

36:17.758 --> 36:18.759
Give him your coat.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.647
LUCY: Mick, you're being crazy.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.482
JOE: Let us take you to a doctor.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.067
Let us call it in.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.611
Somebody else can come around
and pick 'em up.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.280
-No.
-Hey look, man, it's freezing cold.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.449
You're hurt. Hey, this is really stupid.

36:41.532 --> 36:42.617
I'm all right.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.828
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.498
I gotta do this myself. Please.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.754
Mick, one hour! You call in one hour
or we're coming back!

36:58.633 --> 37:01.219
(overlapping chatter)

37:01.302 --> 37:02.762
Slow down. Turning a corner here.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.180
Watch your feet, Sarge.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:09.352 --> 37:14.232
Oh, that old parable about Mohammed
and the mountain comes to mind.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.525
Mohammed won't come to the mountain.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.986
We don't need a parable,
Lieutenant, we need a forklift.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.864
Actually, in this case, it's the mountain
that can't get to Mohammed.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.159
What I'm simply suggesting
is that we call in the coroner,

37:25.243 --> 37:27.745
cordon off the area,
let him proceed with his autopsy

37:27.828 --> 37:29.872
and then we'll remove
this fella piece by piece.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.667
I saw that movie. <i>Texas Chainsaw Coroner.</i>

37:32.750 --> 37:33.960
I don't think so, Howard.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.419
HOWARD: Well, what's your bright idea?

37:36.671 --> 37:39.757
-Spit and axle grease.
-STAN: That's the spirit.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.593
Frank? In here.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.472
I'll take your place, Captain.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.685
Straight and to the point.

37:51.143 --> 37:54.105
Detweiler's scheduled a press conference
for 5 o'clock this afternoon.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.774
You're taking us into a hornet's nest
and I won't be taken.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.442
We can make our case.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.444
And say you do make it stand up.
What do you gain?

38:00.528 --> 38:02.905
Say you send her to jail
for six months, a year.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.282
What have you gained
and what have you lost?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.076
You gave Detweiler
the name of our witness.

38:07.159 --> 38:11.497
A bail-jumping ex-con cornerstone
of your case? You bet I did.

38:11.789 --> 38:15.376
When that gets out they'll be throwing
Arnie's mom a ticker tape parade.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.671
You saying public pressure
outweighs facts of law?

38:19.255 --> 38:22.675
I'm saying the entire criminal justice
community is against you, Captain.

38:23.050 --> 38:26.178
So she killed some street scum
as he's committing a crime.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.639
So what? What about a man
who tries to incinerate

38:28.723 --> 38:31.600
his wife and his son?
Isn't that the real outrage?

38:31.684 --> 38:35.229
Sort out your priorities, Frank.
I'm busy cleaning up your mess.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.191
(men shouting, grunting)

38:39.275 --> 38:40.609
Make way, please.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.570
Excuse me. Clear, please.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.448
-Hey, careful!
-Oh!

38:45.531 --> 38:49.910
(grunting, straining continue)

38:58.544 --> 38:59.712
Hey, careful, Andy!

38:59.795 --> 39:02.923
(screams)

39:03.007 --> 39:04.425
What? What?

39:04.967 --> 39:07.470
Fellas, I've done it!
I've herniated myself!

39:07.553 --> 39:08.971
I've strained my...

39:09.055 --> 39:11.223
(all yelling)

39:11.307 --> 39:12.767
(loud crashing)

39:13.976 --> 39:16.270
-What was that?
-Uh, boiler. Kicks up some--

39:16.354 --> 39:19.106
Oh, Lord, I can't bear it!

39:19.440 --> 39:21.192
It's worse than the last time.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.407
Defendant moves for
90 days psychiatric evaluation.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.242
-Denied.
-Then 60.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.286
Defendant hears voices, Your Honor.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.122
So does everybody.
And they don't pour gas on people.

39:36.415 --> 39:39.752
Counselor, I'm no psychologist,

39:40.127 --> 39:42.922
but I'm not giving defendant
in these heinous circumstances

39:43.005 --> 39:45.925
60 days to pull the Freudian wool
over our eyes.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.594
(sighs)

39:49.136 --> 39:53.015
Forty-eight hours summary psych workup,
remand to County.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.642
Short date for preliminary.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.310
-(bangs gavel)
-Next.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.275
-What's 48 hours mean?
-Two days.

40:03.609 --> 40:04.443
What?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.947
Means they intend to find you sane.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.291
Involuntary manslaughter? Since when?

40:19.792 --> 40:23.254
Since two hours of yelling and screaming
between my boss and yours.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.173
JUDGE: Will counsel please approach?
You too, Captain.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.722
Gentlemen, is this a toss?

40:33.806 --> 40:37.059
-Absolutely not.
-Irwin?

40:37.601 --> 40:38.436
We're not asking for bail.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.438
The circumstances
are obviously exceptional.

40:40.938 --> 40:44.191
If I may say so, Judge,
the only thing exceptional here

40:44.275 --> 40:47.570
is how public perception
is shaping judicial perception.

40:47.653 --> 40:50.448
-IRWIN: Ugh.
-In the last case,

40:50.990 --> 40:53.951
we had a certifiable candidate
for a padded cell,

40:54.034 --> 40:56.370
whose lunacy has been
conveniently overlooked

40:56.454 --> 40:59.123
because the public regards
his conduct as heinous.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.668
Right here, we have a perfectly sane woman

41:02.751 --> 41:04.336
who's walking away from a murder

41:04.420 --> 41:07.298
because the public perceives
her conduct as heroic.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.843
Thank you sincerely, Captain.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.930
Now, will we all step back, please?

41:17.099 --> 41:17.933
(judge sighs)

41:25.441 --> 41:28.611
Released on recognizance. Long date.

41:28.694 --> 41:32.198
(reporters clamoring)

41:32.281 --> 41:35.493
I think they understood all along,
it was just a matter of formalities.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.827
Where'd you learn to shoot, Mary?

41:36.911 --> 41:38.245
Oh, I was raised on a farm.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.705
But I've kept in practice.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.540
That woman killed my boy!

41:41.624 --> 41:43.501
She butchered him! She killed him!

41:43.584 --> 41:46.629
-Murderer! Assassin!
-Mr. Alva, not here, not now.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.590
-Get him out of here.
-Get that man away!

41:49.673 --> 41:51.592
-(yelling)
-Assassin! She killed him!

41:51.675 --> 41:54.386
Assassin! Assassin!

41:54.470 --> 41:56.889
LEO: We got Santa Claus
on the sleigh, let's go.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.432
NEAL: Got enough rope on this guy?

41:59.266 --> 42:02.686
I want every available body
pullin' on the end of these ropes.

42:03.145 --> 42:05.189
(indistinct chatter)

42:07.399 --> 42:09.944
Do you suppose this is how
they built the pyramids?

42:10.277 --> 42:11.862
Well, he sure was a huge guy.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.614
Poor Paul.

42:14.031 --> 42:18.160
He tried diets,
but he had absolutely no willpower.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.746
Gina... I'm wondering--

42:21.247 --> 42:23.374
I don't want to be too personal,

42:23.457 --> 42:24.959
and you certainly don't have
to answer this

42:25.042 --> 42:26.043
if you don't want to...

42:27.086 --> 42:28.212
What, Harry?

42:29.797 --> 42:32.216
Well, I'm kind of wondering
how a woman like you

42:32.299 --> 42:33.884
got hooked up with a guy like that.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.387
Well...

42:37.846 --> 42:39.557
he was just lonely.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.850
Like everybody else.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.271
And he had a gentle way about him.

42:46.021 --> 42:48.607
He liked to take care of me, and...

42:49.108 --> 42:51.652
I like that. A lot.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.281
-Everything secure up there?
-MAN: Right, Sarge.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.533
See, I was just 15 when we met,

42:57.616 --> 43:00.536
and when he first popped the question,

43:00.786 --> 43:02.913
honestly I didn't know at first.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.999
-I was very young.
-STAN: Ready? One...

43:05.082 --> 43:06.834
-And my dad, he...
-Two...

43:07.167 --> 43:08.335
Three!

43:09.503 --> 43:13.299
I said to myself,
"Gina, where are you gonna find

43:13.382 --> 43:15.801
-another man like that?"
-STAN: Good job!

43:16.260 --> 43:19.054
A man so kind and so giving.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.266
A man with millions of dollars somewhere,

43:22.349 --> 43:24.643
-which the government will never find.
-STAN: One, two, three...

43:24.727 --> 43:26.353
-Pull!
-A man who's had

43:26.437 --> 43:28.897
two major heart operations.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.525
STAN: One, two, three...

43:33.902 --> 43:35.613
-Whoa!
-Gina!

43:35.696 --> 43:37.698
-(all yelling)
-NEAL: Oh, Lord, he's alive!

43:38.866 --> 43:40.075
(exclaiming)

43:41.535 --> 43:44.955
I mean, uh, the fat pig
has come back to life!

43:45.039 --> 43:46.332
-(kicks wall)
-I'm cursed!

43:46.415 --> 43:48.917
Uh, it's been nice talking to you.
Stop by sometime.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.017
-Hi.
-Hi.

44:06.518 --> 44:07.853
Looks as if you caught a shiner.

44:08.270 --> 44:09.229
Does it show?

44:10.981 --> 44:12.149
It's a tough situation.

44:13.108 --> 44:15.611
-You handled yourself well.
-Thanks.

44:16.528 --> 44:18.822
That poor kid,
he had to unload on somebody.

44:19.365 --> 44:22.368
I'm afraid he's gonna be unloading
on a lot of people in a few years.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.953
-I hope not.
-Yeah.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.213
Good night.

44:36.131 --> 44:36.965
Good night.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.100
(coughing)

45:03.283 --> 45:04.952
(man coughing)

45:15.713 --> 45:18.382
(growling)

45:19.007 --> 45:21.051
(yelling)

45:23.971 --> 45:27.057
(grunting)

45:42.573 --> 45:44.408
(panting)

45:44.491 --> 45:47.911
(yells)

45:51.832 --> 45:54.168
Get... up!

45:54.251 --> 45:55.085
Ow!

45:56.670 --> 45:59.423
(gasping)

46:01.258 --> 46:02.926
Where's my badge and gun?

46:04.845 --> 46:05.929
(yells)

46:10.684 --> 46:13.061
Where's my badge and gun?

46:18.692 --> 46:21.487
(train rumbling past)

46:37.628 --> 46:38.462
(gun cocks)

46:39.421 --> 46:40.255
Go ahead.

46:41.507 --> 46:44.676
You can't do nothin' to me
that ain't been done before.

46:45.594 --> 46:47.971
What way, that's up to you.

46:49.181 --> 46:50.057
Their way.

46:50.849 --> 46:52.017
Yeah.

47:19.086 --> 47:20.337
(chuckles)

47:23.131 --> 47:24.842
Wipe your nose, you're a mess.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.717
(closing theme playing)
