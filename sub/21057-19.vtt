00:36.640 --> 00:41.909
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:29.359 --> 01:30.530
Why are you so late?

01:30.700 --> 01:32.930
The forensic team is already here, so go on in. Hurry up.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.569
It rained yesterday but...

01:41.439 --> 01:42.439
it's too clean.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.799
(Will)

02:44.469 --> 02:47.210
I won't buy the company back.

02:47.770 --> 02:50.110
I don't have anyone around me...

02:51.139 --> 02:53.280
that can run the company well.

02:53.810 --> 02:57.219
Then, we have no choice but to sell it to Gangil Group.

03:19.270 --> 03:21.009
Let me take you home, sir.

03:23.879 --> 03:24.979
That poor woman.

03:43.259 --> 03:45.629
I died.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Detective Lee.

03:52.770 --> 03:54.210
- Yes. - I called the security company.

03:54.639 --> 03:56.240
The service for Ahn Tae Dong's house was canceled...

03:56.240 --> 03:57.610
15 days prior to the incident.

03:57.879 --> 04:00.110
- Who canceled it? - The record says it was Park Ju Mi.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.050
Park Ju Mi? She's the elder son's wife.

04:05.550 --> 04:07.189
So, there's no security camera footage to check.

04:09.050 --> 04:11.659
(Will)

04:11.659 --> 04:14.590
She was definitely killed. What is this will?

04:14.789 --> 04:16.759
I got Park Ji Yeong's phone records.

04:19.029 --> 04:20.670
The eldest son's wife, Park Ju Mi,

04:20.670 --> 04:22.500
was the last person she spoke to on the phone.

04:22.529 --> 04:26.600
She spoke with Cheon Bang Soon for a minute and a half before that.

04:26.740 --> 04:29.540
And the last text message she got says, "Ms. Jo's daughter is...

04:29.610 --> 04:32.139
hospitalized at Yangheung Hospital in Gyeonggi Province."

04:32.410 --> 04:34.879
Ms. Jo? The woman who ran away?

04:35.149 --> 04:36.819
- Who sent it? - Here.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.250
Here, Pungsuk's Kitchen.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.819
Pungsuk's Kitchen.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.389
Hey, come on in.

04:54.069 --> 04:55.129
Let's talk for a minute.

05:10.050 --> 05:11.649
You said that Ms. Park Bok Ja came here...

05:11.649 --> 05:14.089
and ordered the blowfish porridge for Father in person.

05:16.290 --> 05:17.319
That's right.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.360
Father did like your blowfish porridge very much.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.329
But he has never had any problem with it in the past.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.930
Why do you think it gave him such a severe stomachache this time?

05:29.230 --> 05:32.240
The doctor said that it could have been fatal.

05:33.839 --> 05:35.069
I'm sorry, madam.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.980
I did my best to prepare the it to make sure it's safe, but...

05:38.980 --> 05:40.350
Do you think I'll believe that?

05:41.209 --> 05:42.750
You tell me what kind of place Pungsuk's Kitchen is.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.990
You don't charge customers even when a fish bone is found in your food.

05:47.290 --> 05:50.920
And what? Making porridge without removing all the poison...

05:50.920 --> 05:52.290
from the fish was merely a mistake?

05:53.160 --> 05:56.329
- Ms. Woo. - Were you trying to kill Ms. Park?

05:59.699 --> 06:00.970
Madam, what are you talking about?

06:01.170 --> 06:04.040
I'd never do such a thing with food.

06:04.339 --> 06:06.399
You probably didn't know that my father-in-law would eat it.

06:07.009 --> 06:08.410
You thought he was still unconscious.

06:10.980 --> 06:13.680
Is this conversation also being bugged at the moment?

06:16.610 --> 06:19.250
Go to the police station and confess everything.

06:19.620 --> 06:23.519
If you don't, I'll tell everyone about you selling...

06:24.120 --> 06:26.089
all the information that you gather on people in Gangnam.

06:28.730 --> 06:29.959
Ms. Woo, please don't do that.

06:31.199 --> 06:32.430
I'll be doomed if people find out.

06:34.370 --> 06:35.800
Why did you do such a thing?

06:36.230 --> 06:37.269
I just...

06:39.199 --> 06:40.839
I just wanted to teach that woman a lesson.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.040
I know how much poison is needed to cause...

06:45.040 --> 06:46.910
a stomachache or to make it lethal.

06:47.509 --> 06:51.149
I just wanted to show her that she can suffer...

06:52.019 --> 06:54.920
if she messes with me. I did it as a warning.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.290
As you know, that's all the power I have.

07:13.610 --> 07:17.240
A Jin, are you also suspecting that it was my doing?

07:19.410 --> 07:21.449
I really wanted to change and become a good person,

07:23.920 --> 07:27.220
but bad things always happen to me like this.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.230
The porridge is from Pungsuk's Kitchen.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.829
The owner of that place...

07:38.300 --> 07:40.629
has been recording housekeepers' conversations...

07:40.699 --> 07:41.930
that take place there.

07:42.269 --> 07:45.569
Ms. Park Ji Yeong sent this text message to Ms. Woo A Jin.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.069
I never recorded anything.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.310
I guess people made such absurd speculation because...

07:50.310 --> 07:52.040
my place of business is like a hangout for so many.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.209
Feel free to visit and search the place.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.019
All right. Let's move on, then.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.550
You said that you made the porridge for Chairman Ahn,

08:01.620 --> 08:03.819
but a minute amount of poison happened to go in it.

08:04.420 --> 08:05.660
- That's right. - However,

08:05.959 --> 08:07.990
Park Ji Yeong did not tell you to do it.

08:08.790 --> 08:09.790
Correct.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.769
When we were questioning Cheon Bang Soon,

08:14.769 --> 08:17.600
she said that Park Ji Yeong must have told you to do it.

08:18.939 --> 08:20.870
Why would she do that?

08:21.069 --> 08:24.079
It's obviously because she'll inherit more money from him...

08:24.980 --> 08:26.279
if he dies.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.420
Anyway, she never asked me to do such a thing.

08:32.049 --> 08:35.389
Where were you at the time of Park Ji Yeong's death on February 28?

08:48.429 --> 08:49.730
What have you done?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.269
What? What's your problem?

08:53.539 --> 08:56.980
Answer me. Did you do that to kill me?

08:57.240 --> 08:58.279
You obviously didn't die.

09:00.909 --> 09:01.950
Chairman Ahn...

09:02.809 --> 09:04.779
fainted after eating that porridge.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.389
He ate that?

09:08.519 --> 09:10.059
What shall I tell people first?

09:10.059 --> 09:11.990
The fact that someone passed out from your food?

09:11.990 --> 09:12.990
Or, the fact...

09:13.559 --> 09:15.129
that you have been eavesdropping...

09:15.730 --> 09:17.860
on Gangnam people's conversations...

09:17.860 --> 09:19.659
through the bugs you have planted here?

09:19.659 --> 09:22.370
Alternatively, I can say both.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.500
What will yield faster results?

09:27.009 --> 09:30.740
I don't know how powerful some of your customers are,

09:31.039 --> 09:32.440
but I know that you've been getting away...

09:32.440 --> 09:34.750
with things because they got your back.

09:36.149 --> 09:38.320
Nothing happens even when you're reported for tax evasion.

09:38.649 --> 09:41.019
Whoever that has your back must be a real power broker,

09:41.720 --> 09:42.990
but you're done now.

09:44.990 --> 09:46.759
You better turn yourself in...

09:47.889 --> 09:49.129
before I report you to the police.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.600
The Public Prosecutor General is my customer.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.230
I guess you didn't know that.

09:54.429 --> 09:56.169
Then, I'll tell everyone about it...

09:56.840 --> 10:00.440
and get Mr. Public Prosecutor General in trouble as well.

10:00.539 --> 10:03.679
People should know that the Public Prosecutor General is a customer...

10:04.710 --> 10:06.950
of an illegal food business that has committed tax evasion.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.370
Where were you at the time of Park Ji Yeong's death on February 28?

10:31.370 --> 10:32.740
I was sleeping at home.

10:35.070 --> 10:37.110
Have it with ramyeon when you have night shifts.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.679
Wait, please take this back. We can't accept things like this...

10:40.610 --> 10:42.049
Gosh, what is she thinking?

10:44.179 --> 10:46.720
Chairman Ahn left the hospital at the time of Park Ji Yeong's death.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.389
He wasn't at the hospital. I just met his nurse.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.120
What?

10:55.230 --> 10:58.000
On the day that Park Ji Yeong died, you received emergency treatment...

10:58.429 --> 11:00.700
at the ER because you passed out after eating blowfish porridge.

11:01.330 --> 11:02.330
That's what the hospital records say.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.070
Correct.

11:04.799 --> 11:05.840
Did you think...

11:06.570 --> 11:09.039
that Park Ji Yeong intentionally gave you the porridge?

11:12.740 --> 11:13.750
Yes, I did.

11:14.779 --> 11:18.149
Then, that must have made you very angry.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.190
Yes, to the point that I wanted to kill her.

11:28.990 --> 11:30.029
So, what happened?

11:30.100 --> 11:32.860
When I woke up, I realized that I was at the hospital. So, I...

11:40.340 --> 11:42.940
It's me, Mr. Kim. I have to go home.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.539
Come to the hospital now.

11:48.980 --> 11:52.279
So, I went to the hospital, but Chairman Ahn wasn't there.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.120
I looked for him for quite a while.

11:55.990 --> 11:56.990
Chairman Ahn.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.360
Chairman Ahn!

12:03.899 --> 12:05.759
I'm here, sir. Where are you now?

12:06.100 --> 12:08.029
He said that he'd just stay at the hospital,

12:08.470 --> 12:09.669
so I went home.

12:10.539 --> 12:13.909
I'm at the hospital now. Just go home.

12:36.730 --> 12:37.730
Father.

12:42.700 --> 12:43.840
Why do you think she did it?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.500
Why did she try to kill me?

12:48.169 --> 12:49.210
No, Father. She didn't.

12:50.110 --> 12:52.840
I know that she tried to protect you.

13:07.559 --> 13:09.529
Meet me now.

13:22.940 --> 13:26.509
A Jin, are you also suspecting that it was my doing?

13:34.450 --> 13:35.450
I see.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.159
I...

13:41.289 --> 13:44.500
I moved into this house in order to seduce Chairman Ahn.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.730
Everything was planned beforehand,

13:48.299 --> 13:50.870
and moving into this place was obviously a part of the plan.

13:54.409 --> 13:55.840
I mean, look at this fancy mansion.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.909
When else will I...

14:01.210 --> 14:02.250
ever get...

14:04.049 --> 14:05.149
to live like this?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.720
When I was young,

14:12.090 --> 14:14.360
I was so poor.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.000
I even soaked tteokbokki in water hoping that it'd be more filling.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.370
When you soak it in water,

14:23.840 --> 14:25.539
rice cakes of this size...

14:26.769 --> 14:28.570
become this big.

14:36.149 --> 14:37.279
I really wanted...

14:38.919 --> 14:40.789
to live a decent life.

14:44.389 --> 14:46.259
I wanted a fabulous life...

14:47.490 --> 14:49.559
that I could boast about.

14:50.830 --> 14:52.259
I wanted to be able to show off what I had,

14:53.500 --> 14:54.730
drive a nice car,

14:57.139 --> 14:58.470
and boss people around here and there.

15:01.039 --> 15:04.610
Why are people born with their social classes...

15:05.509 --> 15:09.379
branded onto them like carcasses with their grades stamped on them?

15:12.679 --> 15:13.690
You see,

15:16.250 --> 15:17.620
I just wanted to...

15:19.860 --> 15:21.529
erase that stigma.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.230
You didn't have to run away because everything was already yours.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.440
Why did you run away?

15:33.440 --> 15:35.769
I was scared that someone might steal it from me.

15:40.379 --> 15:41.379
My whole life,

15:43.250 --> 15:45.179
people stole things from me.

15:46.019 --> 15:47.019
Even my parents.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.220
They were taken from me.

15:53.190 --> 15:55.230
My adoptive parents abandoned me as well.

15:56.899 --> 15:58.860
I didn't even steal anything,

16:01.169 --> 16:02.870
but I was framed for it and...

16:06.299 --> 16:09.009
I'm one unlucky woman.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.679
That's why I ran away.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.389
I didn't want anyone to steal it from me.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.299
I felt bad for Chairman Ahn.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.600
As you know, all of his children...

16:39.769 --> 16:43.070
just think of that old man as their source of money.

16:44.509 --> 16:46.710
That's why...

16:51.120 --> 16:52.450
That's why...

16:53.789 --> 16:55.720
I wanted to take...

16:56.519 --> 16:57.919
really good care of him.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.460
But...

17:06.930 --> 17:07.970
But...

17:10.098 --> 17:11.539
But this happened.

17:23.519 --> 17:26.650
I thought she made me eat that thing to kill me.

17:27.319 --> 17:30.019
I assumed that she was only after my money.

17:30.890 --> 17:33.119
She'll get the rest of my assets if I die, you know.

17:33.930 --> 17:36.960
I thought that she sees me as money and nothing else.

17:38.059 --> 17:39.099
Father.

17:39.730 --> 17:42.130
She doesn't want you to die.

17:49.839 --> 17:52.140
It's possible that Park Bok Ja cooked up such a ruse...

17:52.740 --> 17:56.609
in order to kill Chairman Ahn and get her hands on all of his assets.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.650
No, she didn't have any reason to do that.

18:00.089 --> 18:01.289
What do you mean by that?

18:01.849 --> 18:05.519
She signed a prenuptial agreement before they got married.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.890
One of the clauses states that...

18:08.890 --> 18:11.299
she'll give up her right of inheritance as a spouse entirely...

18:11.299 --> 18:13.430
should any unfortunate accident occur.

18:14.299 --> 18:17.799
She'll have no rights to any of his assets after he dies.

18:18.970 --> 18:22.269
Does Chairman Ahn Tae Dong know about it?

18:23.539 --> 18:25.240
He never mentioned anything about that...

18:25.710 --> 18:27.250
when he was here to give his statement.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.119
He found out about it after that.

18:32.049 --> 18:35.789
(Prenuptial agreement)

18:43.829 --> 18:45.430
I had completely...

18:48.730 --> 18:50.170
forgotten about this.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.809
Chairman Ahn was not in his hospital room...

19:00.750 --> 19:02.009
at the time of Park Ji Yeong's death.

19:05.119 --> 19:08.049
You and Mr. Ahn Jae Seok are the only ones...

19:08.390 --> 19:10.059
that have firm alibis.

19:14.690 --> 19:17.430
Ms. Jo Gyeong Ja was the first person that called us...

19:18.329 --> 19:19.359
to report Park Bok Ja's death.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.069
I heard that everyone in the family called her Ms. Jo.

19:22.269 --> 19:23.299
That's right.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.009
We have her statement. It's not related to this case,

19:27.269 --> 19:29.140
but she has been charged with theft.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.640
She brought back all the jewelry she stole though.

19:32.509 --> 19:35.009
Have you had a chance to check everything she brought back?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.819
Yes, I have.

19:38.579 --> 19:40.089
I'm sorry, madam.

19:41.150 --> 19:42.519
I don't even know what to say.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.589
Why did you do such a thing?

19:47.089 --> 19:50.130
I needed money because my daughter is ill.

19:51.099 --> 19:52.660
I heard that the family basically went bankrupt,

19:53.930 --> 19:55.400
and before I even realized what I was doing...

19:56.769 --> 19:57.970
I'm sorry, madam.

19:59.099 --> 20:00.509
Why did you come back?

20:04.809 --> 20:06.140
Ms. Park...

20:07.150 --> 20:09.009
called me at the hospital...

20:09.579 --> 20:10.920
where my daughter is.

20:12.750 --> 20:16.049
She told me to come back and said she'd cover the hospital bill.

20:20.359 --> 20:22.490
She said that she'll forgive me...

20:23.130 --> 20:24.700
if I come back,

20:26.299 --> 20:27.529
and that's why I came back.

20:33.339 --> 20:34.369
But...

21:11.440 --> 21:13.279
Please take good care of Father.

21:14.349 --> 21:16.109
- I should get going. - Madam.

21:17.549 --> 21:18.579
Actually,

21:19.619 --> 21:21.619
there's something I need to tell you.

21:45.579 --> 21:46.609
Are you sure?

21:47.450 --> 21:48.910
Yes, I saw it.

21:49.650 --> 21:51.150
I saw it with my own two eyes.

21:51.450 --> 21:52.819
Did you tell the police?

21:54.190 --> 21:55.190
No.

21:55.450 --> 21:56.490
Why didn't you tell them?

21:58.289 --> 21:59.319
That's...

22:02.029 --> 22:03.029
Should I tell the police?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.200
It probably wasn't her doing.

22:14.009 --> 22:16.210
(Vice-chairwoman of Daesung Pulp, Park Ji Yeong)

22:16.309 --> 22:19.839
I guess Woo A Jin and Ahn Jae Seok have alibis.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.849
They sure have firm alibis.

22:24.519 --> 22:27.049
(This resident has been wreaking havoc on residential environment)

22:30.859 --> 22:32.759
Why are you just standing there? Go in and help her.

22:33.630 --> 22:34.660
Can I help her?

22:35.289 --> 22:37.059
It's up to you,

22:37.460 --> 22:40.500
but from a third party's point of view, I think you should help her.

22:40.769 --> 22:42.430
You're a primary party, not a third party.

22:42.430 --> 22:44.599
Then what does that make you, Mister?

22:44.700 --> 22:46.809
"Mister"? Me?

22:47.170 --> 22:50.779
A Jin, please don't try to distance yourself from me.

22:50.779 --> 22:52.539
You're like a totally different person these days.

22:53.349 --> 22:56.680
Mr. Ahn, I'd like you to also pack up your stuff and move out tomorrow.

22:56.849 --> 22:59.049
The third party is moving out.

22:59.380 --> 23:03.559
You and me, the two primaries, should stay here together.

23:04.119 --> 23:06.589
Gosh, I'm speechless. How shameless.

23:07.390 --> 23:09.089
I never go back on what I say...

23:09.089 --> 23:11.500
and I never change the decisions I've made. Do you know that or not?

23:11.559 --> 23:12.960
Don't be like this, A Jin.

23:17.140 --> 23:18.140
Go in.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.670
Just go in!

23:20.369 --> 23:21.410
Gosh.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.640
Are you okay? Give me a second.

23:32.319 --> 23:34.490
Thanks to my wife,

23:34.950 --> 23:36.789
your paintings will be included in a show in New York.

23:37.119 --> 23:38.259
Don't hate me too much.

23:38.619 --> 23:39.759
You piece of trash.

23:40.759 --> 23:42.190
What? Did you just call me "trash"?

23:42.359 --> 23:45.359
Look. You played me, didn't you?

23:46.059 --> 23:49.069
You just wanted to sleep with me. That's all I meant to you, right?

23:49.299 --> 23:50.670
What kind of person do you think I am?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.740
I'm only letting you go because I have a family to protect.

23:54.539 --> 23:56.269
My feelings for you were real.

23:57.710 --> 23:58.910
I loved you.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.210
What? Love?

24:02.480 --> 24:03.480
I'm just speechless.

24:04.650 --> 24:07.750
You're the most selfish trash in the entire world.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.259
You keep saying you love both me and your wife.

24:10.690 --> 24:12.890
You should have been born during the Joseon dynasty.

24:12.960 --> 24:13.990
You're right.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.730
I've arrived at the conclusion that I'm not cut out for this era.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.930
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

24:20.130 --> 24:23.500
Let me give you just one good smack, okay?

24:24.140 --> 24:25.140
What?

24:27.170 --> 24:28.910
Gosh, you're bleeding.

24:33.650 --> 24:36.150
No, not there. Your nose.

24:37.779 --> 24:41.220
What? I have a nosebleed. I've...

24:41.420 --> 24:43.519
I've never gotten a nosebleed from getting smacked.

24:45.059 --> 24:47.059
I absolutely hate violence!

24:51.900 --> 24:53.400
What... What was that about?

24:54.269 --> 24:56.230
What should I do now?

24:57.069 --> 24:58.970
Why on earth did I fall for that fool?

25:05.480 --> 25:06.980
What did I even see in him...

25:08.750 --> 25:11.250
This is precisely why my love for you has died.

25:12.549 --> 25:14.920
I hate violent women more than anything else in the world.

25:15.549 --> 25:17.390
Gosh, look at all this blood.

25:17.759 --> 25:20.359
I've never even donated my blood. Do you know that?

25:27.329 --> 25:29.529
Then, why do you keep saying that you think Woo A Jin killed her?

25:29.900 --> 25:33.000
This case is a very strange one.

25:33.470 --> 25:34.640
It's extremely complicated.

25:35.140 --> 25:38.180
It's also strange that she's deeply involved in the family matters...

25:38.380 --> 25:40.450
even though she and her husband are divorced now.

25:40.549 --> 25:41.849
That can't be the reason.

25:42.049 --> 25:43.720
Well, that's just what my gut is telling me.

25:44.980 --> 25:46.519
Did you circulate Gu Bong Cheol's wanted posters...

25:46.690 --> 25:48.349
and contact other stations?

25:48.549 --> 25:49.589
Of course.

25:50.059 --> 25:51.259
By the way, about Cheon Bang Soon.

25:51.789 --> 25:53.589
Why do you think she called Park Ji Yeong first?

25:53.789 --> 25:56.329
Apparently, she asked for money, but Ji Yeong refused her request.

25:56.460 --> 25:57.700
How much did she ask for?

25:57.859 --> 25:58.900
That I didn't ask.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.769
We definitely need to investigate that woman more.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.980
Ms. Cheon Bang Soon. Please come out for the questioning.

26:16.880 --> 26:20.220
We're detaining you because we're concerned that you might flee.

26:20.420 --> 26:21.720
Why am I the only one detained here?

26:21.950 --> 26:24.289
Ms. Jo and I ran away together. Where is she now?

26:24.289 --> 26:26.490
She brought back everything she took.

26:26.829 --> 26:29.859
Anyway, she will be punished for what she did,

26:30.099 --> 26:32.059
but we're not detaining her for the investigation.

26:34.829 --> 26:36.430
What did you and Park Ji Yeong talk about...

26:37.039 --> 26:38.039
when you spoke to her for the last time?

26:38.970 --> 26:41.839
I already told you. I asked her for money.

26:42.140 --> 26:43.170
How much did you ask for?

26:43.480 --> 26:44.509
One million dollars.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.910
You pulled that number out of a hat? It must've been based on something.

26:50.950 --> 26:51.950
Where are you now?

26:53.220 --> 26:54.650
Turn yourself in before you get caught...

26:54.650 --> 26:56.250
because it'll be better for your sake.

26:56.549 --> 26:57.589
Give me money.

26:57.960 --> 27:01.359
If you don't, I'll tell everyone that you used to be a bar girl.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.759
I heard you ran away with 75 million dollars.

27:04.430 --> 27:06.630
You can definitely spare me one million dollars.

27:08.329 --> 27:10.039
What did you say to me when you brought me there?

27:10.640 --> 27:12.369
You said that you would treat me well.

27:12.799 --> 27:13.910
Hey, Bang Soon.

27:14.670 --> 27:18.180
I deserted you because I knew that you were this kind of person.

27:19.980 --> 27:22.079
You'll tell everyone that I used to be a bar girl?

27:25.019 --> 27:27.390
All right. Do whatever you want.

27:29.589 --> 27:31.490
You need to completely erase your past...

27:31.490 --> 27:33.559
if you want to climb up the social ladder.

27:33.559 --> 27:36.029
Do you want that label to follow you around all your life?

27:36.390 --> 27:39.160
Do you think people will believe you if you tell them that?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.039
You probably have no idea what an amazing thing money is.

27:45.569 --> 27:49.170
All the truths and lies you tell...

27:50.140 --> 27:53.140
I can cover it all up with money.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.410
You wouldn't know because you've never had it.

27:56.880 --> 27:57.950
Bang Soon.

27:58.619 --> 27:59.980
You better watch out...

28:00.390 --> 28:02.490
because I can put you behind bars for defamation.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.319
Bok Ja! I won't forgive you!

28:08.089 --> 28:10.299
Bring back what you stole.

28:10.859 --> 28:13.259
Then, I'll forgive you.

28:14.769 --> 28:17.200
I'm at home now.

28:18.700 --> 28:19.740
I'm back.

28:26.539 --> 28:29.549
So? Did you go back?

28:29.779 --> 28:30.779
No.

28:31.849 --> 28:33.049
I didn't go back.

28:33.849 --> 28:35.619
- Why? - I just...

28:37.019 --> 28:38.990
I couldn't trust Bok Ja anymore.

28:41.730 --> 28:43.289
Aren't you sad...

28:44.359 --> 28:45.500
that she died?

28:50.170 --> 28:53.440
I would have killed her myself if she hadn't been killed.

28:56.039 --> 28:57.079
Why do you say that?

28:58.440 --> 28:59.440
Gosh...

29:00.109 --> 29:02.450
I mean, she came from nothing.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.480
I couldn't stand her being all snobby.

29:07.650 --> 29:11.519
She used to serve liquor at a bar and sleep with guys for money.

29:12.190 --> 29:13.430
She used to go by the name, Cho Hui.

29:14.930 --> 29:16.529
She's no better than me.

29:21.269 --> 29:24.400
Had you gone back,

29:24.970 --> 29:28.640
how do you think she would have treated you?

29:36.750 --> 29:37.920
That fool...

29:39.750 --> 29:40.750
How foolish.

29:42.549 --> 29:44.819
She shouldn't have followed me here in the first place.

29:55.970 --> 29:58.970
It's me. I'm back.

30:00.210 --> 30:03.039
I'll compensate you for all the jewelry that has been stolen,

30:04.279 --> 30:07.250
so please drop the charges against Bang Soon.

30:17.589 --> 30:19.559
I'm heading out to the police station to give my statement.

30:21.829 --> 30:23.029
The police called a number of times,

30:24.329 --> 30:25.829
asking me to appear at the station for questioning.

30:26.730 --> 30:28.529
Don't avoid them. They'll suspect you even more.

30:29.299 --> 30:30.670
I'll tell them everything first.

30:30.799 --> 30:33.740
I'm thinking about what I should say to them.

30:35.069 --> 30:36.069
What do you mean?

30:36.210 --> 30:39.539
Should I lie to them about going to the hotel to take the money...

30:39.539 --> 30:41.509
from Park Bok Ja and everything else that happened after that?

30:42.680 --> 30:44.980
I'm just not sure where my story should begin.

30:45.349 --> 30:47.190
She's dead anyway.

30:47.619 --> 30:50.359
Who cares? Say whatever you want.

30:51.359 --> 30:54.029
By the way, how's Dad doing?

30:55.289 --> 30:58.099
Let's go home. Things are now back to how they used to be.

31:00.130 --> 31:01.430
That woman is dead now.

31:09.109 --> 31:11.180
So, you're saying she had returned...

31:11.180 --> 31:12.710
when you got back from your parents' place.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.450
- Yes. - We saw that the two of you...

31:16.009 --> 31:18.819
spoke on the phone before she died. What did you two talk about?

31:19.119 --> 31:21.750
She just said that she'll compensate me for the jewelry...

31:21.750 --> 31:23.390
that Cheon Bang Soon stole.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.660
Where were you and who were you with...

31:26.319 --> 31:27.930
when she died?

31:28.430 --> 31:29.859
I was with my husband.

31:32.559 --> 31:33.670
Didn't you report him missing?

31:34.500 --> 31:35.529
I did.

31:36.170 --> 31:38.970
I managed to get a hold of him a few days before Park Bok Ja died.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.339
Then, where was he the whole time?

31:43.339 --> 31:44.579
His hobby is hunting.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.079
He said he was at a cabin in a hunting area he frequents.

31:47.279 --> 31:50.480
Then, where is he now?

31:59.619 --> 32:01.490
At a members-only resort called Leo Resort.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.359
Everyone in the family goes there to relax from time to time.

32:06.559 --> 32:09.829
Then, where's Ms. Ahn Jae Hui now?

32:13.299 --> 32:14.339
Who is it?

32:15.039 --> 32:16.940
Jae Gu, it's me.

32:17.410 --> 32:18.440
Goodness.

32:24.119 --> 32:25.119
Why did you come here?

32:25.549 --> 32:27.950
Jae Seok told me that you're staying here.

32:28.190 --> 32:29.390
Why do you look so freaked out?

32:29.890 --> 32:32.019
Jae Gu, I'm so scared right now.

32:32.490 --> 32:33.890
I'm frightened.

32:34.059 --> 32:35.160
Why are you scared?

32:35.930 --> 32:37.660
- What should I do? - About what?

32:38.859 --> 32:41.369
I saw it.

32:41.430 --> 32:42.470
What did you see?

32:43.569 --> 32:44.599
The killer.

32:45.470 --> 32:46.470
What?

32:47.710 --> 32:50.980
That day, I fell asleep upstairs for a little while.

32:54.309 --> 32:56.480
I was thirsty when I woke up, so I went downstairs.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.819
But, when I went downstairs...

33:15.069 --> 33:16.430
Park Bok Ja was dead.

33:17.740 --> 33:19.039
Ms. Jo was standing there.

33:20.309 --> 33:22.009
I ran away because I was so scared.

33:22.710 --> 33:26.180
So, are you saying Ms. Jo is the killer?

33:27.150 --> 33:28.150
Yes.

33:30.019 --> 33:33.789
What should I do, Jae Gu? I should tell the police, right?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.720
- Of course, you should. - But...

33:36.450 --> 33:40.029
I told the police that I wasn't home even though I was actually there.

33:40.430 --> 33:42.630
What? Why did you lie to them?

33:43.259 --> 33:45.059
I just didn't want them to suspect me.

33:46.130 --> 33:49.099
Jo Gyeong Ja, the first person who found the victim,

33:49.730 --> 33:51.170
called us at 9:17 a.m.

33:51.940 --> 33:54.470
Ahn Jae Hui, who was upstairs, came downstairs right at that moment...

33:54.670 --> 33:56.980
- and saw Jo Gyeong Ja? - That's correct.

33:57.509 --> 34:01.109
She saw Ahn Jae Hui running away and assumed that she'd be the killer.

34:01.849 --> 34:05.119
They pegged each other as the killer in their statements.

34:05.349 --> 34:07.349
Jo Gyeong Ja was at a hospital in Gyeonggi Province...

34:07.349 --> 34:09.820
at the time of the victim's death as her daughter is hospitalized there.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.360
We confirmed her alibi.

34:11.518 --> 34:13.360
- What about Ahn Jae Hui? - She was at home.

34:14.190 --> 34:16.159
She was the only one there at the time of the victim's death.

34:16.630 --> 34:18.000
- And? - She lied to us.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.059
She said she wasn't home.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.969
She did say that she saw Jo Gyeong Ja when she came downstairs,

34:22.230 --> 34:24.539
but she keeps saying she wasn't home, which makes no sense at all.

34:25.369 --> 34:26.869
All of Chairman Ahn's children are weird.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.369
I'm thinking that's probably why he gave...

34:29.440 --> 34:30.880
all of his assets to his new wife.

34:32.139 --> 34:33.710
Have you questioned Ahn Jae Gu yet?

34:33.780 --> 34:35.150
He said he'll come to the station soon.

34:36.309 --> 34:39.079
Let's catch the killer soon. Who do you guys think it is?

34:39.280 --> 34:40.289
By the way,

34:42.150 --> 34:43.389
we found a will at the scene.

34:46.090 --> 34:49.090
We compared it with Park Ji Yeong's handwriting and she didn't write it.

34:50.030 --> 34:52.230
We looked through her belongings...

34:52.860 --> 34:55.030
and found this in her wallet.

34:59.239 --> 35:02.210
The handwriting on that note matches the one...

35:02.739 --> 35:03.780
on the will.

35:04.710 --> 35:06.809
What is this? And what is this note?

35:09.349 --> 35:11.820
- You'll be a fourth grader soon. - Yes.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.289
I heard that your school is closer to the house you're moving to.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.889
Yes, Grandpa. I'll be able to walk to school.

35:18.590 --> 35:20.159
That's great.

35:21.659 --> 35:23.230
- Grandpa. - Yes?

35:23.630 --> 35:25.659
You've changed a lot.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.800
I've changed? Really?

35:28.130 --> 35:30.070
- Yes. - How?

35:30.469 --> 35:32.340
You look younger than you did before,

35:32.340 --> 35:34.539
and you sound friendlier.

35:34.670 --> 35:37.610
You look happier too. You also don't yell anymore.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.349
- You think so? - Yes.

35:42.780 --> 35:44.650
I'm happy to know that you think I've changed for the better.

35:45.219 --> 35:47.590
All of those changes happened...

35:47.849 --> 35:49.190
after you met Grandma.

35:52.960 --> 35:53.960
Ji Hu, we should go.

35:54.659 --> 35:56.699
Father, we'll get going.

35:57.260 --> 35:58.300
Take good care of yourself.

35:58.630 --> 36:00.599
- A Jin. - Yes.

36:01.070 --> 36:03.539
Hold a good funeral for her.

36:04.469 --> 36:05.599
You should attend it.

36:05.940 --> 36:06.940
No, I won't.

36:09.610 --> 36:12.809
Ji Hu, can you go to Un Gyu's room for a minute?

36:13.139 --> 36:14.150
Sure.

36:21.849 --> 36:25.989
Someone in our family killed her.

36:29.530 --> 36:31.429
I feel so guilty.

36:32.429 --> 36:34.000
You have no reason to feel guilty, Father.

36:35.199 --> 36:36.969
I killed her.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.039
She got killed like that because of me.

36:43.340 --> 36:46.639
I feel too guilty to even attend her funeral.

36:49.010 --> 36:50.650
Thanks for taking care of it all by yourself.

36:53.079 --> 36:55.019
No problem, please don't worry.

36:56.449 --> 36:57.619
And I wish you all the best.

36:58.719 --> 36:59.719
Thanks for everything you've done for the family.

37:02.690 --> 37:05.900
Jae Seok and I are no longer married,

37:06.429 --> 37:07.800
but I'll visit you often.

37:10.199 --> 37:12.300
I was happy...

37:14.139 --> 37:15.539
while I lived with her.

37:17.679 --> 37:19.710
Yes, you were.

37:20.750 --> 37:21.780
I know that.

37:25.079 --> 37:26.449
Life is...

37:27.190 --> 37:28.789
Looking back now at this old age,

37:30.619 --> 37:34.030
I know that what matters is eating the things you want to eat,

37:34.659 --> 37:36.159
going to the places that you want to go,

37:37.500 --> 37:40.329
and meeting the people you want to meet. That's all there is to it.

37:42.429 --> 37:44.070
You get angry when you can't do those things,

37:44.869 --> 37:46.340
and you're happy when you get to enjoy those things.

37:47.869 --> 37:49.969
Life is just growing old like that.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.849
While living with her, I was truly...

37:58.019 --> 37:59.050
happy.

38:06.519 --> 38:09.590
By the way, did Grandma go somewhere?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.500
Well. Yes, she's away now.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.800
Where did she go?

38:13.699 --> 38:15.699
- Abroad. - Which country?

38:16.400 --> 38:18.739
My princess, you're bombarding me with questions again.

38:18.869 --> 38:19.900
Tell me. Which country?

38:22.039 --> 38:24.610
- France. - France? Why?

38:27.750 --> 38:28.780
To study art.

38:29.309 --> 38:30.349
She's studying art?

38:30.650 --> 38:32.980
Yes. She wants to become a painter.

38:33.690 --> 38:36.219
Oh, I see. I knew it.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.789
I could tell.

38:39.659 --> 38:41.690
What? What do you mean?

38:42.130 --> 38:43.760
Have you looked into her eyes?

38:45.099 --> 38:48.000
- Her eyes? - The eyes can't lie.

38:48.929 --> 38:51.199
Her eyes are... How should I put this?

38:51.840 --> 38:53.469
They were always full of dreams.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.869
Dreams?

38:57.780 --> 39:00.150
- Let's go. - Dreams and desires.

39:01.150 --> 39:03.679
What would be the difference between the two?

39:05.179 --> 39:07.119
Should I have just kept on dreaming...

39:08.420 --> 39:09.449
like that little girl said...

39:10.389 --> 39:12.420
and have done no more?

39:18.960 --> 39:20.230
If I can be born again,

39:21.670 --> 39:22.969
I'll become a painter.

39:38.719 --> 39:40.349
I heard you've moved out of A Jin's place.

39:41.289 --> 39:42.289
Yes.

39:43.690 --> 39:45.420
Artists are allowed to be a little promiscuous.

39:46.190 --> 39:47.530
I just had a problem with you...

39:47.590 --> 39:49.489
having an affair with my good friend's husband.

39:50.699 --> 39:53.699
Whenever you meet a guy, you should do some digging...

39:53.699 --> 39:56.000
and vet him before you start dating him.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.139
Korea is a small country.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.809
I guess the reunification will expand the borders,

40:01.440 --> 40:02.739
but without that, everyone is connected...

40:02.739 --> 40:03.840
by just two degrees of separation.

40:07.210 --> 40:08.949
You should start preparing for the show now.

40:09.579 --> 40:11.280
Yes, which canvas size should I go for?

40:11.579 --> 40:13.519
You need to get A Jin's advice even on things like that.

40:16.150 --> 40:17.860
You know that Park Bok Ja died, right?

40:18.719 --> 40:20.260
Yes, I gave a statement to the police...

40:20.260 --> 40:22.659
as Jae Seok and A Jin's alibi witness.

40:22.860 --> 40:24.900
Why don't you explore that theme in your painting? Death.

40:27.469 --> 40:31.739
After this year, the exhibition will probably be turned into a biennale,

40:32.239 --> 40:34.110
but all the works in the past years have been too colorful.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.170
Hope and vision?

40:35.639 --> 40:37.579
We've only shown works that explored such themes.

40:38.380 --> 40:40.449
No more utopian themes. How about dystopia?

40:41.380 --> 40:42.750
That should be your direction.

40:43.519 --> 40:46.050
Will such a dark subject suit my style?

40:47.150 --> 40:48.989
Your painting, War II,

40:49.320 --> 40:51.219
is the most impactful work you've produced so far.

40:52.559 --> 40:55.489
Doesn't Park Bok Ja's death inspire you?

40:57.159 --> 40:58.829
Don't you pity that poor woman?

40:59.929 --> 41:01.469
I feel so bad for her.

41:02.469 --> 41:04.599
She died after tasting a fleeting bliss.

41:05.699 --> 41:07.539
The party was way too short.

41:07.909 --> 41:09.170
When someone dies,

41:09.869 --> 41:13.610
the death becomes a mere gossiping topic for someone else.

41:14.780 --> 41:18.150
But my death will become a painting.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.289
Life is truly ironic,

41:21.820 --> 41:23.860
yet there's something that runs through the whole course of it.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.690
(A Jin's bag)

41:27.760 --> 41:29.489
Five pairs of the pumps.

41:30.230 --> 41:32.099
For the boots... What?

41:34.230 --> 41:35.429
Where did my will go?

41:35.869 --> 41:38.239
- Your will? - Yes, it's just something I wrote.

41:38.840 --> 41:39.869
A Jin.

41:40.639 --> 41:41.670
I picked this up.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.449
It's beautiful, isn't it?

41:53.420 --> 41:55.449
Yes, it turned out so well.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.030
What am I supposed to do now with this gorgeous suit?

42:02.030 --> 42:05.130
We can't even do a fitting. She never got to try it on.

42:08.099 --> 42:09.099
This will look great on her.

42:12.300 --> 42:15.769
Daesung Pulp was taken over by Gangil Group today.

42:16.210 --> 42:19.380
Last year, there was a lot of news about Park Ji Yeong, the wife...

42:19.380 --> 42:22.579
of Daesung Pulp's founder, Ahn Tae Dong, selling the company shares...

42:22.579 --> 42:25.679
as soon as they were transferred to her by Chairman Ahn.

42:26.550 --> 42:29.719
However, her death which occurred on the 28th of last month...

42:29.989 --> 42:32.190
has given rise to various speculations and suspicions.

42:32.820 --> 42:36.090
The police, who are investigating Park Ji Yeong's death, stated...

42:36.289 --> 42:38.829
that they have found a crucial piece of evidence at the scene...

42:38.929 --> 42:42.000
and that they're focusing on tracking down the suspect.

42:46.239 --> 42:47.269
It looks like...

42:47.969 --> 42:51.110
she died after being hit twice by the killer.

42:53.349 --> 42:55.550
The killer didn't leave footprints anywhere in the house.

42:55.710 --> 42:58.349
We didn't find the killer's saliva or fingerprints on the scene either.

42:58.650 --> 43:00.650
All we found was her family's fingerprints.

43:00.889 --> 43:02.420
Could it be one of the family members' doing?

43:02.619 --> 43:04.519
It was someone who knows the passcode for the door,

43:05.489 --> 43:07.690
somebody who knew that the victim was home at the time.

43:08.090 --> 43:10.260
Most importantly,

43:10.929 --> 43:12.659
those with the clearest motive for murdering her are...

43:13.570 --> 43:14.599
her family members.

43:16.070 --> 43:17.099
And...

43:17.670 --> 43:20.539
This is the crucial piece of evidence we've found.

43:21.010 --> 43:23.139
We've identified the prime suspect.

43:27.349 --> 43:29.250
Did everything go well at the police station?

43:30.550 --> 43:33.019
Of course. I gave them my statement.

43:33.050 --> 43:36.150
Gosh. Visiting a police station is never a pleasant experience.

43:37.289 --> 43:38.619
The dividends will be distributed tomorrow.

43:39.460 --> 43:41.059
The deal was closed at 120 million dollars,

43:41.789 --> 43:43.260
so each person will get four million dollars.

43:48.329 --> 43:50.400
Do the two of you have a secret deal or something?

43:50.599 --> 43:52.300
Why are you two exchanging looks like that?

43:52.670 --> 43:53.670
Gosh.

43:53.670 --> 43:56.409
- Are you seeing each other? - You and your nonsense again.

43:59.940 --> 44:03.079
I need to use the washroom, so go ahead with your secret talk.

44:08.949 --> 44:11.820
What happened? The branch manager is losing it.

44:12.260 --> 44:14.630
Park Ji Yeong must be close to reporters.

44:14.889 --> 44:16.289
She even distributed a press release...

44:16.289 --> 44:17.630
that says she was conned by MK Capital.

44:17.630 --> 44:18.630
I'm aware.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.369
You'll be in deep trouble they find out about this.

44:21.570 --> 44:22.969
They'll kill us.

44:24.039 --> 44:27.139
Do I really have to live in this anxiety for that Billion dollars?

44:27.210 --> 44:31.110
Hey, I'm taking 60 percent. I mean, I did all the work.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.809
You jerk. You're at it again?

44:32.980 --> 44:35.550
Gosh, I had to get blood on my hands!

44:37.949 --> 44:38.980
Don't tell me...

44:39.820 --> 44:40.820
Did you kill her?

44:41.889 --> 44:42.889
Was it your doing?

44:43.820 --> 44:44.820
It wasn't you, right?

44:45.190 --> 44:48.630
Those who were intoxicated by money were not at all ashamed...

44:48.730 --> 44:51.230
of being untruthful or deceiving others.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.329
Also, they thought that human life...

44:53.900 --> 44:57.199
could never be more valuable than money.

44:57.639 --> 45:00.110
(Confirmation of transfer of the deceased)

45:05.179 --> 45:07.949
The body has been sent to Gwangun Hospital.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.820
- Okay. - I hope the funeral goes well.

45:11.050 --> 45:13.219
Please come back after the funeral for further questioning.

45:13.920 --> 45:14.920
Sure.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.900
Please put this suit on her.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.269
We worried about possible misfortunes when we were happy,

45:35.239 --> 45:38.139
and we hoped for happiness when such misfortunes befell us.

45:38.980 --> 45:41.650
Most importantly, we lived with ceaseless desires...

45:42.210 --> 45:44.380
for things that we couldn't have.

45:45.579 --> 45:48.389
The days we were sad outnumbered the days that we were happy,

45:49.420 --> 45:52.989
and pain always outpowered sadness...

45:53.389 --> 45:54.489
in this thing called life.

45:55.690 --> 45:59.059
I was grateful for life itself.

45:59.659 --> 46:02.500
"I thank and love..."

46:03.539 --> 46:05.869
"the life I've lived and the people I've met..."

46:05.869 --> 46:07.269
"over the course of my life."

46:10.280 --> 46:12.139
Whose will is this?

46:20.150 --> 46:23.619
You went to Park Ji Yeong's suite at Saint Palace Hotel...

46:23.989 --> 46:25.360
on January 23rd,

46:25.719 --> 46:29.190
and you were caught by her bodyguard there.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.760
Please tell me what happened after that.

46:32.630 --> 46:35.269
Ms. Park said that his continuous threats were making her anxious,

46:35.829 --> 46:36.900
so I took him away from her.

46:37.400 --> 46:39.039
Why didn't you report him to the police?

46:39.239 --> 46:40.570
My client didn't want that.

46:41.510 --> 46:43.239
I just did what I was told to do.

46:43.579 --> 46:46.039
- So, it was Park Ji Yeong's order? - Correct.

46:46.750 --> 46:49.349
So? What happened after that?

46:50.650 --> 46:52.019
I had a talk with him and told him not to do it again.

46:53.389 --> 46:55.420
- Then I let him go. - What?

46:55.750 --> 46:58.460
That was also my client's order.

47:01.829 --> 47:03.059
That doesn't make any sense.

47:03.329 --> 47:05.760
We received a missing-person report for Jae Gu Ahn.

47:05.900 --> 47:07.230
He was nowhere to be found.

47:07.969 --> 47:10.469
He's probably at a hunting preserve.

47:10.800 --> 47:13.269
That's where he told me that he was headed.

47:13.710 --> 47:14.769
I don't get it.

47:16.239 --> 47:19.309
If you let him go like that, he'd go back to Park Ji Yeong...

47:19.309 --> 47:20.579
and try to threaten her again.

47:22.650 --> 47:25.420
She told you to just let him go?

47:25.920 --> 47:26.949
Yes.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.500
Mr. Han, I brought him to a motel nearby.

47:43.969 --> 47:45.639
Okay, get out of there. It's a family fight after all.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.039
We shouldn't be meddling in it.

47:48.969 --> 47:50.480
We just have to do what we need to do.

47:50.780 --> 47:51.780
Okay, got it.

47:57.320 --> 47:59.920
Were you really at the hunting preserve?

47:59.920 --> 48:00.920
Yes.

48:02.349 --> 48:03.889
Why didn't you go back?

48:04.559 --> 48:08.130
You neither went home nor went back to Park Ji Yeong's hotel room.

48:09.690 --> 48:12.260
That's because I didn't want...

48:12.829 --> 48:14.900
to harass her anymore.

48:16.599 --> 48:18.000
That's just how I felt. All of a sudden,

48:19.400 --> 48:21.269
I felt that everything was pointless.

48:21.710 --> 48:23.679
You said that you were with your wife...

48:24.739 --> 48:27.150
at Leo Resort around 2am on February 28.

48:27.980 --> 48:31.480
- That's correct. - We went through all the footage,

48:32.380 --> 48:36.119
but it unfortunately didn't show you...

48:37.590 --> 48:40.289
- entering the room that day. - I checked into the resort...

48:40.989 --> 48:43.159
on the 24th and didn't step out of the room at all.

48:43.289 --> 48:44.630
Where were you that day?

48:44.630 --> 48:45.960
Like I told you, I was at Leo Resort.

48:51.300 --> 48:52.340
This.

48:53.409 --> 48:54.409
It's yours, isn't it?

48:57.710 --> 48:59.739
That's the knife you used when you attempted...

49:00.780 --> 49:01.809
to kill her in the past, right?

49:03.420 --> 49:07.489
You dropped that knife at the scene.

49:10.489 --> 49:11.489
You didn't know, did you?

49:12.389 --> 49:13.530
What?

49:17.059 --> 49:18.260
You found this at the scene?

49:21.570 --> 49:25.769
You deeply resented the victim, Park Ji Yeong.

49:26.769 --> 49:28.510
You had planned her murder several times,

49:29.269 --> 49:30.809
but none of your attempts succeeded.

49:31.909 --> 49:35.280
That was after you found out that she came back,

49:36.010 --> 49:39.750
and you assumed that she had planned to kill your father...

49:40.119 --> 49:42.619
by giving him food with poison,

49:42.750 --> 49:45.460
so your anger and hatred toward her must've been more intense than ever.

49:56.130 --> 50:00.000
You must've left the house after killing her like that,

50:02.210 --> 50:05.079
but then you saw your footprints with the wet soil from the rain.

50:05.940 --> 50:08.480
Hence, you probably thought that you had to clean them up.

50:09.809 --> 50:10.849
Then...

50:17.360 --> 50:21.059
You dropped this jackknife by the door.

50:27.329 --> 50:28.369
Why are you here?

50:29.500 --> 50:32.340
Jae Gu, was it your doing?

50:33.670 --> 50:37.309
No, it wasn't me. I wasn't in Seoul on February 28.

50:37.679 --> 50:38.679
I was at Leo Resort.

50:39.309 --> 50:40.809
Sir, please make sure you pay me...

50:40.809 --> 50:42.750
for all of my hours up to February 28.

50:49.090 --> 50:52.460
Do you think that I killed her?

51:06.670 --> 51:07.710
It's all done.

51:07.940 --> 51:08.940
Thanks for everything.

51:10.909 --> 51:13.380
Go to a sauna and get some rest for the next few days.

51:21.250 --> 51:23.820
Whom do you think the police are suspecting at the moment?

51:25.360 --> 51:27.489
Why do you think I let Ahn Jae Gu go?

51:28.260 --> 51:31.960
I let him go right away, so that he can take care of Park Bok Ja.

51:32.630 --> 51:33.630
That fool.

51:34.429 --> 51:36.030
He didn't kill her and kept himself busy with something else.

51:36.570 --> 51:37.769
What did he do?

52:16.469 --> 52:19.539
(Visitor's parking)

52:26.690 --> 52:28.320
Was everything okay at the funeral?

52:30.119 --> 52:31.119
Yes.

52:31.460 --> 52:34.659
What did you do with Ms. Park's belongings?

52:37.260 --> 52:40.829
They were things that she wanted so badly.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.599
I wanted her to take all of them.

52:46.139 --> 52:47.570
The smell of burning leather was...

52:48.469 --> 52:50.210
really revolting.

52:50.940 --> 52:53.909
What a waste. You burned all that expensive stuff.

52:54.309 --> 52:55.309
Then,

52:57.380 --> 53:01.289
I burned my last gift for her.

53:02.389 --> 53:03.420
What was it?

53:09.889 --> 53:11.159
Do you like art?

53:11.400 --> 53:13.530
I just enjoy looking at paintings.

53:14.099 --> 53:15.570
Life is tough, you know.

53:16.670 --> 53:19.940
Looking at paintings gives me peace of mind.

53:20.340 --> 53:24.309
If I can be born again, I'll become a painter.

53:35.619 --> 53:38.590
We found this amongst her belongings.

53:40.789 --> 53:42.929
I wrote this.

53:43.860 --> 53:45.800
- Sorry? - Well...

53:46.329 --> 53:48.300
I'm taking a meditation class,

53:48.429 --> 53:52.300
and we had to write our will as our homework.

53:53.300 --> 53:54.309
I see.

53:55.739 --> 53:58.380
Then, how come Ms. Park had it?

54:00.710 --> 54:02.909
I must've left it at that house.

54:06.380 --> 54:07.389
Then,

54:07.949 --> 54:09.989
did you write this too?

54:10.119 --> 54:12.719
(Thank you so much for washing my clothes perfectly.)

54:12.719 --> 54:15.190
(May happiness surround you always, wherever you go.)

54:19.929 --> 54:21.199
It looks pretty old.

54:23.769 --> 54:24.800
Yes.

54:26.199 --> 54:27.239
I think I wrote this.

54:28.610 --> 54:30.909
So, Park Bok Ja.

54:31.809 --> 54:34.010
I mean, Ms. Park Ji Yeong. You said you met her for the first time...

54:34.480 --> 54:36.210
when you interviewed her for the caregiver position,

54:36.409 --> 54:40.190
but we did some digging and found out that the two of you go way back.

54:41.719 --> 54:44.690
You met her for the first time...

54:45.190 --> 54:46.190
at the hotel...

54:46.760 --> 54:49.460
where she stayed long-term after she disappeared...

54:50.360 --> 54:51.500
with the money...

54:52.760 --> 54:54.099
from selling the company.

54:56.099 --> 54:57.269
You really don't remember?

54:57.769 --> 55:00.769
The suite at Saint Palace Hotel.

55:04.409 --> 55:06.239
I do remember now.

55:26.800 --> 55:29.000
May happiness surround you always, wherever you go.

55:44.550 --> 55:45.579
But...

55:47.789 --> 55:49.320
I'll be good to him from now on.

55:50.489 --> 55:52.059
You trust me, right?

55:53.389 --> 55:54.429
Yes, I trust you.

55:55.860 --> 55:57.059
I'm always...

55:59.800 --> 56:03.329
grateful for everything you do.

56:16.780 --> 56:17.780
You left this.

56:20.449 --> 56:22.619
It was here. I've been looking for it.

58:03.559 --> 58:04.559
Hello.

58:04.820 --> 58:06.889
Well, I think I left my wallet here...

58:06.889 --> 58:09.030
late at night on February 28.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.800
May I check your security camera footage?

58:12.059 --> 58:15.300
Not now. I need my boss' permission on things like this.

58:16.170 --> 58:17.300
Could you come back tomorrow morning?

58:41.929 --> 58:43.460
Hello? Mr. Kim?

58:46.030 --> 58:47.530
I'm at the hospital now.

58:48.599 --> 58:49.670
Just go home.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.639
(The Lady in dignity)

01:00:06.949 --> 01:00:10.480
Maybe we were meant to meet. I'm a big fan of Matisse's works too.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.619
I do like his paintings,

01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:15.519
but I actually like Manet more.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:16.619
I'm sorry.

01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:20.059
I shouldn't have hired her.

01:00:20.989 --> 01:00:22.030
I'm sorry.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.130
I was the one who introduced that painter...

01:00:26.059 --> 01:00:27.199
to you,

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:31.170
and Father met that woman because of me.

01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:35.539
That's not your fault. Those who made the choices are at fault.

01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:38.840
There are things that you just can't pull yourself away from.

01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:42.550
I liked her a lot.

01:00:42.949 --> 01:00:44.349
I'm going into the police station now.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:46.119
Dump everything on Park Bok Ja.

01:00:46.179 --> 01:00:47.590
She's already dead.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.420
Mr. Gu. Hey, Gu Bong Cheol!

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.860
Do you have an alibi?

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.559
I guess my husband and I will have to be each other's witness.

01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:56.699
The eldest son's wife ordered me to kill her.

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:58.000
Why did he do such a thing?

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:02.199
We'll get his sentence mitigated. Let's do our best to help him out.

01:01:02.929 --> 01:01:03.969
After all,

01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:07.210
tomorrow is another day.
