00:02.294 --> 00:05.958
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.048 --> 00:08.916
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:12.002
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:14.929
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.265 --> 00:17.131
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.226 --> 00:19.969
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.062 --> 00:23.351
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.978
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.068 --> 00:28.276
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:30.945
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.031 --> 00:32.067
<i>Is that what you think I am?</i>

00:32.156 --> 00:34.069
- Some sort of evil secretary?
- You tell me.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.527
I am now and forever will be
my husband's partner.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.783
Pleased to meet you, Dominic Lanse.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.291
- Hello, Mr. Allen.
- DeVoe?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.997
<i>If you hurt my family...</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:47.791
<i>I have no interest in your family.</i>

00:47.881 --> 00:50.248
<i>Besides, you're gonna need someone
to miss you when you're gone.</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:51.332
<i>What did you do?</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:52.416
I left something for you.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.585
<i>I don't have need for it anymore.</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:57.297
Barry Allen, you're under arrest
for the murder of Clifford DeVoe.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.258
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

01:01.812 --> 01:05.305
<i>And I'm an innocent man.</i>

01:07.317 --> 01:11.152
<i>I know that you'll find
my fingerprints all over his body.</i>

01:12.698 --> 01:16.317
<i>And I know that
you'll find his DNA on mine.</i>

01:18.954 --> 01:23.198
<i>But I don't know who stabbed him,</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:27.164
<i>or how he ended up in my loft.</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:32.757
<i>All I can tell you is
I'm being framed</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:35.793
<i>for something I didn't do.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:39.673
I didn't kill Clifford DeVoe.

01:48.108 --> 01:52.478
All right, Allen, let's run it back
from the beginning.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.658
<i>This is exactly
what DeVoe wanted,</i>

01:59.745 --> 02:03.409
and we all played
right into his plan. Especially me.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.285
Why would DeVoe wanna
orchestrate all of this?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.582
I don't know.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.251
But we know that this started
when I was still in the Speed Force.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.454
But why target Dominic?

02:10.547 --> 02:12.914
Dominic's power must have
allowed DeVoe to inhabit his body.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.499
We should have been
on top of this earlier.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.760
What about the other metas
on the bus? Why create them?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.554
Part of a larger plan.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.806
How are you even here
right now, Allen?

02:26.897 --> 02:27.978
Aren't you on house arrest?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.647
- Yeah. Well...
- He's at Joe's actually.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.186
Either that or at the courthouse.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.019
I managed to hack into
the ankle-monitor GPS.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.862
That's not the only thing
Cisco hacked.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.356
When you came out of the Speed Force,

02:38.450 --> 02:39.986
you were talking gibberish
at C.C.P.D.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.239
You said something about
not wanting to kill anyone.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.695
I digitally scrubbed the video.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.533
Last thing we want is
somebody hearing something

02:45.624 --> 02:47.240
we don't want them to hear.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.623
<i>Your Honor, I'm innocent.
I didn't do this.</i>

02:51.088 --> 02:52.420
<i>I didn't kill anyone.</i>

02:52.506 --> 02:54.088
Yeah, I mean, I don't remember
saying any of that.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.673
- You don't?
- No.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.588
We should look at
everything Allen said

02:58.679 --> 03:00.011
when he first came
out of the Speed Force.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.884
- Might give us a clue.
- That's a good idea.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.134
Okay, guys, but remember,

03:03.225 --> 03:05.137
I mean, considering all the evidence
they have against me,

03:05.227 --> 03:07.014
this trial is not even gonna
last very long.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.972
Okay. But with Cecile taking
a leave of absence to represent you,

03:10.065 --> 03:11.351
you got the best lawyer in town.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.431
Yeah.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.767
And even if they did find you guilty,

03:13.860 --> 03:15.192
it's not like any prison
can hold you.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.858
Well, I'm not gonna run.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.776
I won't be a fugitive.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.858
If I'm convicted,
I have to go to prison.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.284
We're not gonna let that happen.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.283
Right.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.955
<i>Let's get to work.</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:36.252
- We should get to the courthouse.
- Yeah.

03:36.842 --> 03:37.923
How are you doing?

03:38.009 --> 03:40.501
They say the first year of
marriage is always the hardest.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.846
But I never thought my husband
being on trial for murder

03:43.932 --> 03:45.173
would be one of the challenges.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.974
We have been through so much.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.392
We'll get through this, too.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.221
Will we, Barry?

03:51.314 --> 03:54.057
I know the Speed Force gave you
a new outlook on life, but...

03:54.985 --> 03:57.193
I don't know if being positive
is enough right now.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.397
I'm just trying to be strong
for the team and for you.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.233
Remember, we're the Flash.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.653
We're the Flash.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.205
Ralph, hold up.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.123
Listen, I'm not gonna let
Barry go to prison.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.666
I failed his dad,
I'm not gonna fail him.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.914
I need your help.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.916
My help?
As in, the stretchy kind?

04:16.005 --> 04:18.248
As in "the underhanded
private investigator" kind.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.377
Oh, uh...

04:19.468 --> 04:21.676
- No offense taken.
- Come on.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.139
Science has long pondered
what would be required

04:26.224 --> 04:31.219
to successfully transfer consciousness
from one living being to another.

04:32.647 --> 04:37.187
But we've accomplished far beyond
a simple transfer of consciousness.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.817
We've extracted that which elevates
our humanity, and added upon it.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.491
I am both who I was before,

04:47.120 --> 04:48.952
and who I desire to become.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.165
Yes, you are, my love.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.045
My hand still feels foreign
upon your flesh.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.632
And you don't care for it.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.252
No, I do.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.298
As I said, I inherited
my host's ability to read thoughts.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.011
We have never lied
to each other before.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.345
Let's not begin now.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.230
Okay.

05:18.944 --> 05:22.108
Marlize, my love,

05:24.115 --> 05:26.027
see past this body,

05:26.701 --> 05:28.818
see past these eyes.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.119
See me, Clifford.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.575
Clifford.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.080
I am nothing without you.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.553
<i>Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</i>

05:56.815 --> 05:59.353
for you to understand what it is
I'm about to tell you today,

05:59.442 --> 06:00.558
you need to do something.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.028
I need you to believe
in the impossible.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.902
<i>As children, we're taught</i>

06:06.992 --> 06:09.655
<i>that the police are there
to protect us, to serve.</i>

06:09.744 --> 06:12.077
We're told that
our tax dollars go toward

06:12.163 --> 06:14.997
training them to be
the champions of the city.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.163
<i>But for some of us,
it still seems impossible</i>

06:18.253 --> 06:19.664
that a police investigator,

06:19.754 --> 06:22.963
one of Central City's finest,
could betray that trust.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.795
<i>And even worse, under the guise
of upholding the law to commit</i>

06:25.886 --> 06:29.050
the most heinous act that one person
could carry out against another.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.590
But that is exactly
what Barry Allen did.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.468
<i>And the prosecution
will prove beyond any doubt</i>

06:35.562 --> 06:38.600
that he stood among us
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.306
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

06:40.692 --> 06:42.524
Barry Allen wears a mask.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.277
<i>He used his connection to the law,</i>

06:45.363 --> 06:47.400
<i>his experience as
a police investigator,</i>

06:47.490 --> 06:49.231
especially as
a crime scene technician,

06:49.326 --> 06:52.945
to stalk a beloved professor, husband,

06:53.997 --> 06:57.115
and murder Clifford DeVoe
in cold blood.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.954
All right, Mr. Borman,
just sign on the dotted line

07:03.048 --> 07:04.630
and your savings account
is all set up.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.341
I appreciate you helping me out.
I wanna get this right.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.713
It's my first savings account.

07:11.973 --> 07:12.963
You okay?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.388
Yeah. Just a little light-headed
before lunch, I guess.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.848
Have a great day.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.821
Ladies and gentlemen,
the document in my hand

07:36.915 --> 07:39.453
is a court-issued restraining order.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.783
It's issued to Marlize DeVoe,

07:40.877 --> 07:42.914
the wife of the victim,
on behalf of her husband,

07:43.213 --> 07:47.082
against a Mr. Bartholomew
Henry Allen.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.467
Now, if you'd like a better look,
I have a bigger copy.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.011
<i>But if you allow me to call out
what's written underneath</i>

07:53.098 --> 07:55.681
"reason for order issue..."
"Harassment."

07:57.060 --> 07:59.803
Defendant was seen just days earlier,

07:59.896 --> 08:02.513
illegally breaking and entering
into the victim's house,

08:02.607 --> 08:04.564
searching through
the victim's effects.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.267
<i>A man obsessed.</i>

08:06.361 --> 08:11.527
Barry Allen's skin cells were found
under the nails of the victim.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.777
Now, imagine that if you can.

08:12.867 --> 08:17.328
Mr. DeVoe, a man in a wheelchair,
desperately trying to defend himself

08:17.414 --> 08:19.747
<i>as Mr. Allen sought to overpower him.</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:25.124
And finally, this is the knife
that was used to kill Clifford DeVoe.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.089
If it looks new,
that's because it is.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.876
It was a wedding gift to Mr. Allen.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.546
Now, let's just let that
sink in for a moment.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.597
This was supposed to commemorate

08:37.683 --> 08:40.017
the most joyous moments
in a couple's lives.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.809
<i>But instead, Mr. Allen used it</i>

08:41.895 --> 08:44.559
<i>to forever separate a couple
from one another.</i>

08:44.649 --> 08:47.392
He used a wedding gift
as a murder weapon.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.228
<i>That is a special kind of evil.</i>

08:50.655 --> 08:52.692
<i>But it showed an absolute disregard...</i>

08:52.782 --> 08:53.863
Cisco.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.987
There's a meta attack downtown.
We gotta go.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.365
I'll stay here with Barry.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.506
When you're done here get some
coverage of the workstations.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.083
Detective, would you get
a statement, please?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.010
- Mr. Ramon.
- Captain.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.086
What happened here?

09:16.306 --> 09:19.265
Vintage Central City.
Meaning, another weird one.

09:19.350 --> 09:23.060
No data breach, nothing stolen,
everyone just collapsed.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.059
I have officers at the hospital
interviewing people now.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.811
But so far, no one knows anything.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.108
<i>Oh.</i>

09:29.694 --> 09:31.401
Dark matter city.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.275
Yeah, we're definitely
dealing with a meta here.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.356
You wanna see what kind of perimeter
we're dealing with?

09:35.700 --> 09:36.690
You read my mind.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.703
Hey, Joe, are you sure
you're okay to run this case?

09:41.581 --> 09:44.665
Because I totally understand
if you need a little more time...

09:45.835 --> 09:47.667
I'm fine. Really.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.586
I may have to go over
to the courthouse later.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.588
Yeah...

09:52.801 --> 09:54.292
I'm actually heading
over there myself.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.637
The prosecution called me to testify.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.422
<i>I'm sorry, Joe.</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:01.758
<i>You know how much I care about Barry,</i>

10:01.851 --> 10:04.059
but I have to tell them what I know.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.477
I get it.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

10:09.818 --> 10:10.808
Yeah.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.359
Do I need to repeat the question?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.906
No, I heard it.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.031
The person standing over
Clifford DeVoe's body

10:21.121 --> 10:22.282
was Barry Allen.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.576
No further questions, Your Honor.

10:29.045 --> 10:33.255
Captain Singh, you stated that
you interviewed Barry Allen

10:33.341 --> 10:35.253
five years ago for the job of CSI.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.960
I wonder, what was
your first impression of him?

10:39.222 --> 10:40.212
He was young.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.307
<i>Had half the experience of
everyone else I interviewed.</i>

10:43.393 --> 10:45.680
Hmm. Why'd you hire him?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.386
It was really something
he said in the interview.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.061
Everyone always talks about
going after the criminal, the guilty,

10:52.861 --> 10:55.148
but Allen said
he wanted to help the victims,

10:55.655 --> 10:56.987
<i>the innocents.</i>

10:59.200 --> 11:01.863
I thought Central City
deserved someone like that.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.870
Allen is one of the good ones.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.583
"One of the good ones."

11:12.797 --> 11:14.413
No further questions, Your Honor.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.006
<i>I'd like to redirect,
Your Honor.</i>

11:21.556 --> 11:22.763
<i>Proceed.</i>

11:23.016 --> 11:26.726
Would you cover for Mr. Allen
if you had to?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.389
No, of course not.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.472
No? It says here
in his personnel file

11:31.566 --> 11:34.104
that he took a six-month sabbatical
to the Czech Republic.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.277
Did he get approval from you first?

11:36.362 --> 11:37.569
Not exactly.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.355
He said it was for
something personal.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.985
I'm sure he had a good reason to go.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.276
Is "saving the world" a good reason?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.865
It also says in here that he was late

11:45.955 --> 11:49.539
seventy-two times in the past two years.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.118
Did you ever ask him why?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.202
No.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.504
Because regardless of
what time he got in,

11:55.590 --> 11:57.001
he always did his job.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.042
I was just curious to imagine
what he does with his time

12:00.136 --> 12:01.877
instead of being at work.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.964
It's almost like
he has this secret life.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.057
<i>So in spite of all these infractions,</i>

12:08.144 --> 12:10.101
you never thought to discipline him?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.470
What are you suggesting?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.681
That whether you realize it or not,

12:14.609 --> 12:17.477
you've been covering the ugly truth
about Mr. Allen for years now.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.027
That is not true.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.605
Is it true that he was targeting
and harassing Mr. DeVoe?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.491
Yes or no?

12:26.621 --> 12:27.611
Yes.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.990
Which is why I granted DeVoe
the restraining order

12:31.084 --> 12:32.575
and told Allen to stay away.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.456
But that didn't stop him, did it?
He kept going after him,

12:34.545 --> 12:36.537
right up until the night
that Mr. DeVoe was killed.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.497
Objection. Conjecture.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.707
<i>Withdrawn.</i>

12:40.260 --> 12:42.343
Captain, now you said that

12:42.428 --> 12:45.921
Mr. Allen wants to help the victims
and the innocents.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.383
But disappearing for months
at a time, being late 72 times...

12:49.477 --> 12:53.391
Doesn't sound like he wants to help
or care for anybody but himself.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.649
Now, do you still think that he's
"one of the good ones"?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.029
I hope you're right about this.

13:07.370 --> 13:11.034
Oh, trust me. I'm very good
at reading body language.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.831
Right now, you're tense.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.203
Now, you're annoyed.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.034
<i>Oh. Here we go.</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:22.382
- Yahtzee!
- Did you get that?

13:22.885 --> 13:23.875
Ralphy got it.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.553
I smell an acquittal.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.728
As we thought might happen,
we are in trouble.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.181
David's testimony hurt us,
but we still have a few options.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.890
What are they?

13:38.985 --> 13:39.975
I can go to Slater.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.436
I can ask for a plea deal.
Maybe get you a shorter sentence.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.656
Or we could use an insanity defense.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.618
No. Both those options
are admitting I'm guilty, and I'm not.

13:49.704 --> 13:53.288
Fine. Then the only other way
out of this is for you to testify.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.240
Cecile, I'm sorry. I won't do it.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.294
All of the evidence, every bit of it,
it points to you.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.213
<i>If you're not willing to take that stand
and defend yourself,</i>

14:01.299 --> 14:02.756
then this is an impossible case.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.920
I'm not taking the stand.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.798
Barry, even if that means
turning this case around

14:06.888 --> 14:08.004
and not going to jail?

14:08.097 --> 14:10.635
Iris, if I testify, I have to lie.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.342
I commit perjury.
I become exactly who they think I am.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.685
- Then don't lie.
- What?

14:15.772 --> 14:16.762
Tell the truth.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.602
Tell everyone you're the Flash.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.108
Barry, if the court knows
you're the Flash,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.815
then you can explain everything
and they'll believe you.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.655
Prosecution is gonna wrap up soon.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.281
I need your answer today.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.408
This is the only way, Barry.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.157
Tell the city you're the Flash.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.791
<i>This is all we got?</i>

14:46.302 --> 14:47.884
This isn't a lot to go on.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.633
I know, okay?
We're lucky we even got this footage.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.806
For some reason,
all the security cameras were fried.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.805
Hey, guys, I was just at the hospital
going over the medical records

14:55.895 --> 14:57.227
of everyone who was at the bank.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.726
- I know why they passed out.
- Why did they pass out?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.523
Well, they all suffered from fatigue,

15:01.609 --> 15:04.522
vomiting, abdominal pain,
skin rashes.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.854
So, everyone ate a bad burrito?

15:06.948 --> 15:09.486
No. Radiation poisoning.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.696
That's why the security cameras
are fried.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.529
Mmm-hmm. We gotta find this guy
before he poisons the whole city.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.954
- Yeah, or worse.
- Hmm?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.496
Guys, if this meta can cause these
levels of radiation in these patients,

15:20.586 --> 15:24.170
it means this meta has a similar
make-up to a nuclear bomb.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.466
So, like, enough to blow us all up?
What are we talking here?

15:27.552 --> 15:30.386
The fallout from a nuclear explosion
could be catastrophic.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.004
Exactly.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.839
- "Fallout."
- Great name.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.474
Terrible power.

15:35.935 --> 15:40.020
Okay, I'll see if the satellite
can track his radiation signature.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.975
Mrs. DeVoe, when did you
first meet Mr. Allen?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.309
Um...

15:47.071 --> 15:49.814
Mr. Allen showed up at my house
almost two months ago,

15:51.242 --> 15:54.451
claiming to be investigating
one of Clifford's former colleagues.

15:55.079 --> 15:59.369
We reassured him that we didn't have
information to help him.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.827
But Mr. Allen persisted
and continued to harass my husband.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.128
And what prompted
the restraining order?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.290
My husband has...

16:09.635 --> 16:12.594
Had advancing ALS.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.672
I was alone with Clifford
most of the time.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.009
But something about
Mr. Allen's aggressive manner

16:19.103 --> 16:22.471
just made me feel unsafe,
so we went to the authorities.

16:24.192 --> 16:27.026
And we thought the complaint
would dissuade Mr. Allen.

16:27.904 --> 16:28.894
But it didn't.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.814
<i>Psst.</i>

16:37.830 --> 16:39.947
Could you please
describe for the court

16:40.291 --> 16:43.284
the last time that
you saw your husband?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.544
It was Christmas.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.085
And Clifford wanted to
confront Mr. Allen.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.466
He had hoped that
in the holiday spirit

16:51.552 --> 16:53.589
he could convince him to let us be.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.467
And I...

16:57.099 --> 16:59.341
I begged Clifford not to go.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.052
But even with his disability,

17:02.563 --> 17:07.023
<i>Clifford insisted that it was his job
as my husband to protect us,</i>

17:07.108 --> 17:09.192
to protect me.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.778
He didn't wanna live in fear, so...

17:15.451 --> 17:17.363
He left.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.239
And I wish I could have stopped him,
and stepped in,

17:22.333 --> 17:24.450
and told him not to do this.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.786
But I let him go.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.391
<i>No further questions,
Your Honor.</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:46.146
Your Honor, I would like
to enter Exhibit F into evidence.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.191
Objection, Your Honor. Why wasn't
this entered into discovery?

17:49.277 --> 17:51.269
Oh, I've only recently
received this new evidence.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.352
May we approach?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.401
Your Honor, there are protocols
that need to be observed.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.740
This is my courtroom, Mr. Slater.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.489
I'll run it any way I see fit.

18:02.873 --> 18:03.909
I'll allow it.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.455
These photographs
were taken earlier today.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.253
Mrs. DeVoe...

18:13.259 --> 18:14.420
Could you tell me, please,

18:14.510 --> 18:16.342
who's the man that you're kissing
in that photograph?

18:16.512 --> 18:19.175
<i>It is most certainly
not your husband, correct?</i>

18:22.560 --> 18:23.801
His name is Dominic Lanse.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.556
And how long
have you known Mr. Lanse?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.221
A few months.

18:27.315 --> 18:31.229
<i>So it appears to me that perhaps your
marriage was not quite as perfect</i>

18:31.319 --> 18:32.651
<i>as you've portrayed.</i>

18:32.737 --> 18:36.151
Maybe you were ready
for a life without your husband.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.152
<i>So you ran into the arms
of another man.</i>

18:38.242 --> 18:41.656
Another man you convinced
to kill your husband.

18:48.878 --> 18:53.794
Clifford and I met Dominic Lanse
at an ALS charity gala months ago.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.291
<i>He was there to honor his father,</i>

18:56.385 --> 18:58.377
who had recently passed away
with the disease.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.265
<i>Clifford noticed the bond
that Dominic and I</i>

19:04.143 --> 19:06.851
shared, long before I did.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.473
My husband was happy that
I found someone to talk to,

19:11.734 --> 19:15.648
and he urged me to turn to Dominic
for the needs

19:16.113 --> 19:18.605
and comforts
he could no longer fulfill.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.028
My husband wanted me to be happy.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.287
Clifford didn't see
my relationship with Dominic

19:30.795 --> 19:33.003
<i>as a tool to pull us apart,</i>

19:33.422 --> 19:35.254
but to bring us together.

19:35.758 --> 19:36.748
And it did.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.217
My heart will always
belong to Clifford.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.431
No further questions, Your Honor.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.394
<i>You're excused.</i>

19:54.902 --> 19:56.734
Okay, that did not go well.

19:56.821 --> 19:57.857
What's your decision, Barry?

20:00.366 --> 20:01.732
I'm not gonna do it.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.325
Marlize...

20:12.545 --> 20:14.628
Mrs. West-Allen,
I don't think it's appropriate

20:14.714 --> 20:16.171
for the two of us to be seen talking.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.418
Oh, please.

20:18.092 --> 20:21.711
No one is watching, so you can
drop that ridiculous act already.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.638
If you insist.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.637
Why are you doing this?

20:33.023 --> 20:34.230
What is wrong with you?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.892
It's not about what's wrong with me,

20:36.986 --> 20:38.477
it's what's wrong with the world.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.150
There are problems
bigger than your husband.

20:41.699 --> 20:42.815
Such as?

20:48.706 --> 20:50.663
Whatever it is that you are up to,

20:51.208 --> 20:53.165
it will come to an end.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.789
Such passion.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.963
I had that, too, when Clifford and I
first got married.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.916
But passion fades.

21:01.010 --> 21:05.721
And what remains, if you are
fortunate enough, like Clifford and I,

21:05.806 --> 21:09.140
is something deeper than ardor
that cannot be destroyed.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.139
Then why are you so hell-bent
on destroying our lives?

21:12.521 --> 21:16.140
I am doing what I have to do
for my husband, Mrs. West-Allen.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.688
The question
you should truly be asking

21:20.362 --> 21:22.854
is what are you
willing to do for yours?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.442
Hope you enjoy the rest of the show.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.623
<i>Still no word
from the courthouse.</i>

21:37.713 --> 21:39.545
That's good news, right?
No news is good news?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.168
No. Good news is good news.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.500
No news is miscommunication.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.378
<i>The satellite was able to track</i>

21:46.472 --> 21:48.304
a spike in radiation
downtown on Main Street.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.257
- We found him.
- Fallout's on the move.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.512
We gotta get down there now.

21:51.602 --> 21:52.934
I'll monitor him from here.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.727
- Harry, time to book it.
- Yeah.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.439
- I've got two rads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.405
- Hey, stop!
- Hey!

22:06.492 --> 22:07.949
Stop! Stop!

22:08.118 --> 22:09.234
Stop!

22:11.956 --> 22:13.288
What's going on out there?

22:16.293 --> 22:17.283
Nuclear waste tanker.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.627
Sorry!

22:20.548 --> 22:21.584
Idiots!

22:21.674 --> 22:23.381
- Okay.
- Move along.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.175
<i>Mr. Slater...</i>

22:34.812 --> 22:36.144
<i>Call your next witness.</i>

22:36.397 --> 22:37.683
Thank you, Your Honor.

22:38.983 --> 22:39.973
Your Honor...

22:40.901 --> 22:42.517
There's something you need
to know right now

22:42.611 --> 22:44.443
that will alter
the outcome of this case.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.279
<i>Ms. West-Allen,</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:49.608
I have no idea
what you think you're doing.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.909
Explaining what my husband won't.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.534
Barry Allen is...

23:03.549 --> 23:04.539
Barry Allen is...

23:05.676 --> 23:06.757
The...

23:09.889 --> 23:11.346
What's happening?

23:11.891 --> 23:14.258
We're moving so quickly
that everyone else is still.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.176
How are you able to do this with me?

23:16.270 --> 23:17.886
I actually don't know.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.096
Iris... Hey...

23:21.358 --> 23:24.101
I already decided
not to tell anyone else who I am.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.777
Barry, if the jury knew
that you were the Flash,

23:26.864 --> 23:28.400
there's no way
that they would convict you.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.322
I'm trying to protect you.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.944
Okay? If everyone knew my secret,
we would never stop running.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.707
I would rather run forever with you
than stand alone without you.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.745
It wouldn't just be us running.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.620
Everyone that has stood by us
the last four years

23:43.756 --> 23:45.622
would have a target on their back.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.003
If criminals knew my name,
they'd know my weakness.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.887
I'm trying to be strong, but I...

23:52.973 --> 23:54.009
I know.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.891
I can't anymore.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.512
How can you...

24:00.773 --> 24:01.980
My dad...

24:03.192 --> 24:04.683
He went through this too.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.111
The trial is not over, Barry.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.359
Yeah, it is.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.446
All the evidence points towards me.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.611
You can't tell them, okay?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.328
Okay.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.209
Yes, Ms. West-Allen?

24:31.470 --> 24:32.460
Um...

24:33.806 --> 24:35.047
Your Honor...

24:35.641 --> 24:37.132
Barry Allen

24:37.977 --> 24:38.967
is innocent.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.726
<i>And...</i>

24:41.230 --> 24:43.096
I just thought
you all should know that.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.186
Thank you for your time. Okay.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.703
If there was an award
for Best Crocodile Tears

24:58.789 --> 25:00.576
by the Most
Emotionally Manipulative Widow...

25:00.666 --> 25:02.999
Marlize, definitely in the top three.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.243
Let's snap something
more damning than a lip-lock.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.794
We're not here for that.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.709
Can you do your gross stretchy thing
and slip inside and open the door?

25:14.805 --> 25:15.841
Those are carpet fibers.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.508
Those are from Allen's loft,
aren't they?

25:23.605 --> 25:25.938
You're gonna plant evidence
to frame Marlize.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.102
She was the only one
that could have planted DeVoe's body.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.939
Fibers on the treads of her shoes
places her at the crime scene.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.445
This is the right thing to do, Ralph.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.869
Just open the door. I'll do the rest.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.615
Okay.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.080
It's a solid plan, Joe.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.292
<i>Subtle, but it's crafty
with a touch of pathos.</i>

25:50.674 --> 25:53.508
After this, you're gonna sit back
and kick up your feet

25:53.594 --> 25:55.802
and sleep as sound as a millennial
after Burning Man,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.971
because you did the right thing.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.719
You took down a bad, bad chick.

25:59.808 --> 26:00.844
Ralph, could you hurry up?

26:00.976 --> 26:03.639
And you're gonna ride that feeling
like it's Space Mountain.

26:04.146 --> 26:08.436
And then, when they catch you and
they take your badge and your gun,

26:08.817 --> 26:10.308
that self-righteous indignation

26:10.402 --> 26:12.394
is gonna keep your chest puffed
and your chin up,

26:12.488 --> 26:14.070
because you did the right thing.

26:14.364 --> 26:18.278
Sure, you're gonna be mad
for a few years, but that fades,

26:18.368 --> 26:19.904
evolves,

26:19.995 --> 26:21.202
turns into self-pity.

26:21.872 --> 26:22.953
<i>A few more years</i>

26:24.208 --> 26:26.495
and your life is gonna be a shell
of its former self.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.376
<i>And then, one night,</i>

26:29.797 --> 26:31.504
it's gonna dawn on you that

26:32.049 --> 26:33.585
you did the wrong thing,

26:34.510 --> 26:35.967
<i>and it ruined everything.</i>

26:36.553 --> 26:38.385
<i>Your colleagues won't talk to you,</i>

26:38.472 --> 26:40.304
your friends have vanished,

26:40.891 --> 26:42.223
and your family...

26:43.727 --> 26:45.218
It'll be like...

26:46.647 --> 26:47.854
Like you weren't ever born.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.183
Because you turned into

26:51.276 --> 26:54.610
the very thing that you swore
to protect them from.

27:03.914 --> 27:04.995
Anyhoo...

27:08.127 --> 27:09.584
Good luck with that.

27:23.684 --> 27:24.674
<i>Mr. Slater?</i>

27:25.018 --> 27:26.554
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.389
Ms. Horton,
are you ready to present your case?

27:33.944 --> 27:35.276
The defense rests, Your Honor.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.365
Should've gone
with the insanity plea.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.739
Oh! Excuse me.

28:24.578 --> 28:25.568
What's wrong?

28:34.588 --> 28:36.454
What is going on?

28:44.389 --> 28:47.302
There's a massive spike in radiation
downtown at Prentis and Rollins.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.260
<i>The driver
of the nuclear waste truck.</i>

28:51.355 --> 28:54.564
Radiation signature's
already at 3,000 rads and climbing.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.733
We need to stop this guy
before it hits 10,000.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.400
What happens at 10,000 rads?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.065
Hiroshima.

29:05.118 --> 29:09.954
Barry Allen has dedicated his life
in service of Central City.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.995
He's helped
to solve countless crimes.

29:13.085 --> 29:18.205
His testimony has led to the
conviction of dozens of criminals.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.627
Barry Allen is a good man.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.380
He's an innocent man.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.090
And frankly,
Central City is lucky to have him.

29:30.060 --> 29:35.647
Dare I say,
few men in this city are as honest,

29:36.441 --> 29:38.854
upstanding and dependable.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.603
Mr. Allen?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.406
Your Honor, I...

29:45.617 --> 29:46.607
I have to go.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.079
Barry, what are you doing?

29:52.165 --> 29:53.155
I have to.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.794
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
this is an emergency.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.870
Someone needs me.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.002
And I need you
to respect my courtroom.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.550
I will not stand
for theatrical disruptions.

30:05.554 --> 30:08.467
Your Honor,
my client is still free on bail.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.385
And there are no laws that require

30:10.475 --> 30:12.011
him to be present
during closing statements.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.395
Be advised, Mr. Allen,

30:16.481 --> 30:19.724
you are required by law
to be here for sentencing.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.818
Yes, Your Honor.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.909
Stay where you are!

30:38.086 --> 30:40.123
What is happening to me?

30:41.590 --> 30:42.580
Hold it right there!

30:44.426 --> 30:45.712
I didn't do anything!

30:56.396 --> 30:57.557
<i>You need to stop.</i>

30:57.647 --> 30:58.637
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.978
I understand,
but your radioactivity is dangerous.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.822
<i>- Guys?</i>
- Seven thousand five hundred rads!

31:11.912 --> 31:13.244
Barry, don't get too close to him,
all right?

31:13.330 --> 31:15.663
The radiation he's emitting
is too hot to allow you to self-heal.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.285
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.499
What am I supposed to do?
How do I stop him?

31:24.508 --> 31:25.749
I can't stop this!

31:25.842 --> 31:27.083
Damn!

31:27.177 --> 31:28.418
We need to cool him down.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.543
Killer Frost.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.346
- Great.
- Well...

31:32.432 --> 31:33.639
Go! Turn!

31:33.725 --> 31:34.966
Well, that's not how it works.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.097
I can't just snap my fingers
and make her appear.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.723
It only happens
when I'm scared or angry.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.680
- Oh, good Lord, Caitlin!
- Caitlin!

31:40.774 --> 31:42.060
The city's about to explode!

31:42.150 --> 31:44.483
Everyone! Everything you know
and love!

31:44.569 --> 31:47.403
The birds, the trees, the fish,
the puppies!

31:47.906 --> 31:49.898
Puppies are going down
because you didn't wanna

31:49.991 --> 31:51.198
- show up for work!
- Show up for work!

31:53.703 --> 31:54.819
Thanks.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.993
- That was pretty good.
- Yeah, pretty good.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.073
- Now go already!
- Okay!

32:00.335 --> 32:01.701
Okay, there you go.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.501
What's going on?
Is this business or a social call?

32:06.633 --> 32:07.965
Business, I see.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.444
- Is she okay?
- She's gonna be okay, yeah.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.063
You have any more ideas?

32:30.782 --> 32:31.863
What if I breach him?

32:31.950 --> 32:34.738
Ramon, no, you... You drop him
in a breach, he could explode.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.611
And Fallout's fallout
would kill us all.

32:36.705 --> 32:37.695
Do you think?

32:38.290 --> 32:40.282
Wait, what if I create a vacuum
around him?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.163
That way, even if he does explode,
at least we contain the blast.

32:43.253 --> 32:44.334
<i>Yes. Allen, yes.</i>

32:44.421 --> 32:45.753
That could work.
That could contain it.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.705
Whatever you're gonna do, though,
do it fast.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.631
<i>Falloutjust went above 8,000 rads.</i>

32:59.352 --> 33:02.265
- The vacuum's containing his energy.
<i>- Good.</i>

33:02.355 --> 33:03.596
But he's still getting stronger.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.192
<i>Allen, I don't know how long
you can take this much radiation.</i>

33:08.361 --> 33:11.775
I don't have a choice.
We have to contain his energy.

33:11.865 --> 33:13.276
Allen, 9,000 rads.

33:19.289 --> 33:20.871
Ten thousand rads! Critical mass!

33:20.957 --> 33:22.789
Ramon, you need
to send that energy somewhere.

33:22.876 --> 33:23.866
What? To where?

33:24.085 --> 33:27.123
Earth-15. Earth-15 is a dead Earth!
Breach it there now!

34:05.377 --> 34:06.663
You did it.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.085
Oh, man, you did it.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.418
You saved the day.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.802
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you've reached a verdict?

34:21.141 --> 34:22.132
We have, Your Honor.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.885
<i>All rise.</i>

34:27.857 --> 34:30.690
For docket number 5677-B,

34:31.235 --> 34:34.775
in the matter of <i>The People
v. Bartholomew Henry Allen,</i>

34:35.489 --> 34:38.358
we, the jury,
find the defendant guilty

34:38.952 --> 34:40.568
<i>of murder in the first degree.</i>

34:57.679 --> 34:58.920
Thanks to your meta-metabolism,

34:59.014 --> 35:01.176
your radiation burns should disappear
in the next few minutes.

35:01.933 --> 35:02.923
What about Fallout?

35:03.018 --> 35:05.761
He's unstable,
but we sent him to Tracy's lab.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.390
She's gonna analyze his DNA,

35:07.480 --> 35:08.891
see if it's the same
as the other metas

35:08.982 --> 35:10.314
and be able to neutralize him.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.564
<i>...Superior Court,</i>

35:11.651 --> 35:14.644
<i>where minutes ago, the jury found
Bartholomew Henry Allen guilty</i>

35:14.738 --> 35:16.855
<i>in the murder
of Professor Clifford DeVoe.</i>

35:16.948 --> 35:20.191
<i>Mr. Allen has been a CSI with
the Central City Police Department</i>

35:20.285 --> 35:21.651
<i>for the last five years.</i>

35:21.995 --> 35:23.452
<i>In just a few short hours,</i>

35:23.538 --> 35:26.326
<i>the judge is expected to announce
Mr. Allen's sentence.</i>

35:26.416 --> 35:28.908
<i>Prosecutor Anton Slater
made a statement.</i>

35:29.002 --> 35:30.994
<i>He hoped Mr. Allen
would receive a life sentence,</i>

35:31.087 --> 35:32.999
<i>given the brutal nature of the crime.</i>

35:33.506 --> 35:35.168
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.124
I can't believe this is happening.

35:37.218 --> 35:40.177
Come on, guys,
we just saved the city today.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.922
We knew this wasn't
gonna go my way in court.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.552
That doesn't mean that DeVoe beat us.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.475
Whatever happens,
we're gonna keep fighting.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.722
I know.

35:48.730 --> 35:49.720
<i>We need to get you back.</i>

35:49.981 --> 35:51.472
You need to be there for sentencing.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.562
Yeah.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.188
I'll see you guys later, all right?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.612
I'm gonna be okay, all right?

36:04.037 --> 36:05.027
Come on.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.327
You know, you got your strength
from watching your dad be your rock.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.665
I got mine because...

36:16.257 --> 36:17.464
You're mine.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.297
And I'll be strong for you.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.631
I love you.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.097
I love you.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.550
Come on.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.096
Mr. Allen, are you going
to appeal the verdict...

36:32.190 --> 36:33.271
Step back.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.405
Hey, I need a minute, all right?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.415
Mr. Allen...

36:53.878 --> 36:55.039
DeVoe.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.288
Did you know there was a 12% chance

36:57.382 --> 36:59.339
that you were gonna tell the world
you're the Flash?

37:00.552 --> 37:01.884
I'd recheck your math.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.927
There's no need.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.718
Because no matter
what path you chose,

37:06.808 --> 37:08.845
all avenues led to my triumph.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.892
Why do you want us distracted?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.561
Why do you want me
out of the picture?

37:12.856 --> 37:13.892
What are you planning?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.268
That you think that you could

37:15.358 --> 37:17.224
understand the breadth
of what I'm about to do

37:17.318 --> 37:18.684
is almost humorous.

37:23.450 --> 37:26.067
Yes, I think you will miss Iris.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.407
That's right, Mr. Allen.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.705
I didn't just take Dominic's body.

37:31.791 --> 37:32.998
I took his ability.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.002
I know what you're thinking,
right now.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.500
I want you to hear me say it.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.212
I'm gonna figure a way out of this.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.548
And when I do,

37:49.017 --> 37:50.724
I don't care
whose face you're wearing.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.513
I'm coming for you.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.720
You haven't beaten us yet.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.435
Haven't I?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.777
Have a nice life, Mr. Allen.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.044
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.258
I didn't do this.
I didn't kill anyone.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.589
And I know that one day
the truth will come out.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.099
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:33.144 --> 38:34.635
Rise for sentencing.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.855
In my 30 years behind this bench

38:41.945 --> 38:44.437
<i>I have seen my share of criminals.</i>

38:44.531 --> 38:47.148
<i>But I confess, this defendant</i>

38:47.242 --> 38:48.733
<i>stands apart.</i>

38:49.911 --> 38:52.244
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.367
A few hours ago,

38:54.457 --> 38:56.119
the very existence of our city

38:56.209 --> 38:58.371
came under the threat
of nuclear destruction.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.503
But one man rose
to meet that challenge.

39:01.589 --> 39:05.048
The defendant
was in a position of authority.

39:05.718 --> 39:09.883
Our city trusted him
to bring the guilty to justice.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.222
He ran into danger,

39:12.725 --> 39:15.138
knowing he would suffer
burns all over his body.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.767
He used that trust to take
an innocent and vulnerable life.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.849
This man was not thinking
about himself.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.108
He was thinking about you,

39:23.194 --> 39:24.981
the first responders
on the front lines...

39:25.071 --> 39:29.031
Never have I seen
a defendant more unmoved.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.609
Never have I seen a man
with more bravery.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.615
Never have I seen such inhumanity.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.991
Such heroism.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.744
Such a lack of regard for human life.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.825
<i>It is my great honor</i>

39:39.919 --> 39:44.789
to present Central City
Police Department's Award of Valor

39:44.883 --> 39:46.749
to this city's finest hero.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.251
The fastest man alive...
The Flash!

39:52.307 --> 39:55.425
<i>The court hereby orders
that Bartholomew Henry Allen</i>

39:55.518 --> 39:58.511
should be incarcerated
for the rest of his natural life,

39:58.646 --> 40:01.138
<i>without the possibility of parole.</i>

40:01.649 --> 40:05.063
And that Mr. Allen
be immediately remanded

40:05.153 --> 40:07.486
<i>to Iron Heights Penitentiary.</i>

40:08.114 --> 40:10.822
And may God have mercy on your soul.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.297
<i>Filthy cop!</i>

40:30.595 --> 40:32.336
<i>Badge ain't gonna
help you now.</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:34.088
<i>Be seeing you around, B.</i>

40:35.433 --> 40:37.140
<i>Gonna break you, string bean.</i>

41:01.668 --> 41:03.034
Get comfortable.
