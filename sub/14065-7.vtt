00:01.673 --> 00:02.803
You kill her, Lincoln?

00:02.803 --> 00:04.866
–She was drawn to me!
–Drawn to you?

00:04.866 --> 00:06.380
You're a weird little pervert.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.857
You watch your mouth!

00:07.857 --> 00:09.022
Or what, you'll kill me?

00:09.022 --> 00:10.766
You're an extraordinary woman.

00:10.766 --> 00:12.023
I don't get to meet many.

00:12.023 --> 00:13.709
I met this guy, Tom.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.844
My daughter, she wants me
to fight the cancer,

00:15.844 --> 00:18.564
but I got a second and third opinion,
and they all say it's inoperable.

00:18.564 --> 00:19.900
You see how this makes so much sense?

00:19.900 --> 00:21.881
If you attempt to purchase a lung,

00:21.881 --> 00:24.634
you will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

00:24.634 --> 00:26.947
Tom and I are gonna be
going on a little vacation.

00:26.947 --> 00:29.455
–Where?
–Probably best you don't know.

00:37.975 --> 00:43.172
I don't think wearing costumes during
business hours is such a good idea.

00:43.172 --> 00:44.663
Oh, it's good for morale.

00:44.663 --> 00:47.897
We end up getting a better
turnout for the party.

00:51.557 --> 00:53.513
I wonder what he's done now.

00:53.513 --> 00:55.819
Perjury?
Jerry, I can't keep up.

00:55.819 --> 00:59.205
One day it's the doll,
the next scientologists,

00:59.205 --> 01:00.705
now perjury.

01:00.705 --> 01:02.743
Add to that a little hop.

01:02.743 --> 01:06.120
Okay, uh, deep breath.

01:06.311 --> 01:09.279
And start from the middle.

01:09.279 --> 01:12.585
I was on a jury over the summer,
a federal capital case.

01:12.585 --> 01:14.239
In order to be on such a jury,

01:14.239 --> 01:18.600
you must declare in your questionnaire
that you're not against the death penalty.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.026
–What's with the hop?
–It's a nervous tick.

01:21.026 --> 01:23.755
When I try to control my voice,
sometimes my legs hop, okay?

01:23.755 --> 01:25.708
Would you prefer that I squeal?

01:25.708 --> 01:27.088
Well…

01:27.088 --> 01:28.353
You didn't let me answer.

01:28.353 --> 01:32.208
Anyway, we found the man guilty,
imposed a life sentence.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.539
Cut to weeks later,

01:33.539 --> 01:36.094
I'm doing an interview
in furtherance of my new firm,

01:36.094 --> 01:37.931
I'm being profiled,
if you can imagine,

01:37.931 --> 01:40.426
and somehow the issue
of the death penalty comes up,

01:40.426 --> 01:43.117
and I said that I've always
been categorically opposed.

01:43.117 --> 01:45.623
And the prosecutor from the capital case
must have read it,

01:45.623 --> 01:48.670
and he had me arrested for committing
perjury against the federal court.

01:48.670 --> 01:51.127
And now I'm about to go on trial.

01:51.127 --> 01:52.765
I'm confused.

01:52.765 --> 01:55.281
Oh. I was on a jury over the summer,
a federal capital case…

01:55.281 --> 01:56.600
No, I know what happened.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.576
I'm confused as to why you lied
about your views on capital punishment.

01:59.576 --> 02:01.281
–Because it's wrong.
–Okay, it's wrong.

02:01.281 --> 02:02.362
So why lie?

02:02.362 --> 02:03.978
It's not just the death penalty,

02:03.978 --> 02:07.999
it's the issue that only pro-death people
should get to sit on death cases.

02:07.999 --> 02:09.830
It's stacking the deck, Alan.
It's wrong.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.087
That's why I lied,
to unstack a stacked deck.

02:13.087 --> 02:15.005
And now you're being charged
with perjury.

02:15.005 --> 02:19.488
And the horrible prosecutor man
wants me to serve three years.

02:54.131 --> 02:55.220
The grim reaper?

02:55.220 --> 02:57.012
I thought I could use it
throughout the year,

02:57.012 --> 03:00.209
you know, when I fire people.
It's a nice touch.

03:00.209 --> 03:02.887
You gotta see me in full costume.

03:04.989 --> 03:06.037
Hello.

03:06.037 --> 03:09.606
Hello. Lovely outfit,
but I'm not surprised.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.411
Lincoln.

03:10.411 --> 03:12.870
Did someone speak?
I heard a noise.

03:12.870 --> 03:15.792
It sounded a bit godless,
but I heard it all the same.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.251
May I have a word with you,
Shirley Schmidt?

03:18.251 --> 03:19.308
What are you doing here?

03:19.308 --> 03:22.449
Well, I'm certainly having nothing
to do with you, Mr Dirty Mouth.

03:22.449 --> 03:24.199
I came to talk to Shirley

03:24.199 --> 03:27.279
because she is a name partner
in Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

03:27.279 --> 03:29.755
This is for you, Shirley.

03:30.452 --> 03:32.850
–It's a summons.
–Yes, and I am sorry,

03:32.850 --> 03:34.960
because I sense
you and I could be friends.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.802
But I have been wronged
by your firm, Shirley,

03:37.802 --> 03:40.394
specifically by
Mr Dirty Mouth, here.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.352
He slandered my good name.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.961
Lincoln, not to ruin your plans,

03:43.961 --> 03:45.983
but I have immunity for
what I say in court.

03:45.983 --> 03:49.730
You have qualified immunity,
which you ran viciously amok of.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.141
Oh, you had your fun running over me,
didn't you, Mr Dirty Mouth?

03:53.141 --> 03:55.558
Well, now it's my turn
to run over you.

03:55.558 --> 03:57.935
And again, I am sorry, Shirley.

03:57.935 --> 04:02.909
I feel you and I could've
forged a special bond.

04:05.577 --> 04:09.395
What exactly did you say about him?

04:09.395 --> 04:12.629
Oh, you know, that he might
have been the killer.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.781
♫ I once knew a man ♫

04:18.781 --> 04:20.863
♫ who owned a butcher shop ♫

04:20.863 --> 04:22.427
♫ Ole! ♫

04:22.752 --> 04:29.124
♫ He also had apartments
to rent up on top ♫

04:29.124 --> 04:35.132
♫ but he didn't include on the sign
that he painted “no pets” ♫

04:35.799 --> 04:40.074
♫ And the tenant who rented
had six hungry dogs he regrets ♫

04:40.074 --> 04:41.345
♫ but he said! ♫

04:41.345 --> 04:44.509
♫ When things go wrong ♫

04:44.509 --> 04:48.027
♫ just sing this song ♫

04:48.027 --> 04:51.221
♫ the birds in the trees ♫

04:51.221 --> 04:54.589
♫ will sing “C'est la vie” ♫

04:54.589 --> 04:59.495
♫ and soon you will see
your cares will be free ♫

04:59.495 --> 05:01.516
Denise, what's wrong?

05:01.516 --> 05:02.712
♫ Sing ‘C'est la vie’ ♫

05:02.712 --> 05:05.146
–Daniel.
–What? Daniel Post?

05:05.146 --> 05:08.444
♫ Sing ‘C'est la vie’ ♫

05:08.709 --> 05:11.432
He's dead.

05:11.432 --> 05:12.837
<i>♫ Sing ‘C'est la vie’ ♫</i>

05:12.837 --> 05:14.558
He's dead.

05:18.415 --> 05:19.902
Yeah.

05:23.298 --> 05:24.848
Yeah.

05:28.257 --> 05:30.039
Okay.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.985
Good-bye.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.963
Um…

05:40.124 --> 05:44.515
Daniel died during a lung
transplant surgery in Brazil.

05:44.515 --> 05:47.883
And you get the news
through a mariachi band?

05:47.883 --> 05:50.664
You had to know Daniel.

05:50.664 --> 05:53.157
He, uh, always said that
when his time came,

05:53.157 --> 05:57.194
“Hmm, C'est la vie.”

05:58.309 --> 06:00.234
Is there gonna be a service?

06:00.234 --> 06:02.656
We had one while he was alive.

06:02.656 --> 06:04.706
–Sorry?
–Again…

06:04.706 --> 06:07.491
you had to know Daniel.

06:08.831 --> 06:10.395
I wish I had.

06:10.395 --> 06:13.578
His remains are at Mass General.

06:13.578 --> 06:16.901
So I think I'll go and…

06:16.901 --> 06:20.646
pay my respects there and, uh…

06:21.569 --> 06:23.409
yeah.

06:23.409 --> 06:27.311
–Would you like me to go with you?
–No, thank you.

06:28.161 --> 06:29.886
I'm…

06:29.886 --> 06:31.471
I'm fine.

06:31.471 --> 06:34.926
I've been braced for this
for a long time.

06:34.926 --> 06:37.869
I think…

06:37.869 --> 06:40.382
I'm actually okay.

06:41.114 --> 06:43.746

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:52.621 --> 06:54.097
Maybe not.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.361
Dead?

06:55.361 --> 06:59.685
–Evidently during a lung transplant operation.
–Oh, my God.

06:59.685 --> 07:02.198
Well, do we cancel the Halloween party?

07:02.198 --> 07:05.921
Well, I certainly have to
cancel my costume, but…

07:05.921 --> 07:09.981
no, we're a big firm.
I say we go forward with the party.

07:09.981 --> 07:11.720
Um, on another matter,

07:11.720 --> 07:15.070
we're being sued for slander
by one of Jeffrey's red herrings
in the Scott Little trial.

07:15.070 --> 07:16.661
Which one? There were so many.

07:16.661 --> 07:17.887
The neighbor, Lincoln Meyer.

07:17.887 --> 07:20.808
Great. Do we need to get
outside counsel?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.671
We do not.
I can defend this myself.

07:22.671 --> 07:24.630
–Very bad idea.
–I'm full of them.

07:24.630 --> 07:27.723
At a minimum, we use somebody
not involved in this trial.

07:27.723 --> 07:29.615
Well, that leaves Alan, me and…

07:29.615 --> 07:31.057
Uh, Brad.

07:31.057 --> 07:32.250
No, no, no, no. Not him.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.300
Yes, him.

07:33.300 --> 07:37.017
This will be an opportunity
for the two of you to bond.

07:37.017 --> 07:40.390
Get yourself in a bit
of trouble there, sport?

07:43.795 --> 07:46.107
I'm certainly not defending his deceit.

07:46.107 --> 07:48.693
Mr Espenson never meant to
truly defraud the court.

07:48.693 --> 07:50.691
There's no real proof he lied.

07:50.691 --> 07:53.153
He could have simply been lying
in the subsequent interview

07:53.153 --> 07:56.295
where he was pretending to be
against the death penalty.

07:56.295 --> 07:58.028
Is this how you intend to play it,

07:58.028 --> 08:02.516
that he was truthful with us and
lied during his magazine interview?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.749
No.

08:04.749 --> 08:09.145
I intend to play it by asking for
an exercise of your discretion.

08:09.145 --> 08:12.159
Mr Shore, this case
started in state court.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.855
It was specifically removed
to federal jurisdiction

08:14.855 --> 08:16.851
at the direction of Alberto Gonzales.

08:16.851 --> 08:19.403
Why? Because Massachusetts
doesn't have a death penalty.

08:19.403 --> 08:21.776
So his perjury is a big deal.

08:21.776 --> 08:25.538
My marching orders are
to prosecute him to the full extent.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.936
Now if he wants to plea,

08:27.936 --> 08:29.599
I'll give him 18 months.

08:29.599 --> 08:32.120
My client is not going to
prison for 18 months.

08:32.120 --> 08:36.023
Well, it's either that or three years
as far as I can see.

08:36.835 --> 08:38.716
Come on, Jerry.

09:01.271 --> 09:02.964
Here we go.

09:04.342 --> 09:05.287
What's that?

09:05.287 --> 09:07.731
The remains of Daniel Post.

09:07.731 --> 09:10.417
Okay, he wasn't a large man,
but he was taller than that.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.827
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:11.827 --> 09:13.604
Mr Post donated his body parts

09:13.604 --> 09:16.109
to either research science
or organ transplant facilities.

09:16.109 --> 09:19.197
All that remains is a foot.

09:19.330 --> 09:21.972
–A foot?
–Just the one?

09:21.972 --> 09:23.739
Yes.

09:28.877 --> 09:32.892
Well, we're here.

09:33.194 --> 09:34.645
Yes?

09:34.645 --> 09:36.233
Please.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.239
He looks so peaceful.

09:45.239 --> 09:47.531
That's not Daniel Post.

09:47.531 --> 09:48.423
I beg your pardon?

09:48.423 --> 09:51.503
Daniel Post was 5′7″,
white and a size 8 max.

09:51.503 --> 09:54.012
That is a black foot,
and it is the size of a small boat.

09:54.012 --> 09:55.090
Well, there must be some mistake.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.005
Yes, a big one, and you made it.

09:57.005 --> 09:59.613
That is an African-American foot.

09:59.613 --> 10:01.946
It looks darker in the box.
If we see it in the light…

10:01.946 --> 10:03.668
No, no, I don't need
to see it in the—

10:03.668 --> 10:05.761
where is Daniel Post?

10:05.761 --> 10:06.749
Is everything all right?

10:06.749 --> 10:10.342
No. No, everything is not all right.
For God's sakes…

10:10.599 --> 10:13.330
Please, could you find
my friend something lighter,

10:13.330 --> 10:16.629
possibly in a size eight?

10:25.638 --> 10:27.346
A big foot?

10:27.346 --> 10:29.621
She's meeting with
the facility manager in an hour.

10:29.621 --> 10:31.342
I'd have stayed, but I'm
in court with Jerry.

10:31.342 --> 10:33.572
Give me the address. I'll go.

10:33.572 --> 10:35.474
Brad, how are we doing
with Lincoln Meyer?

10:35.474 --> 10:37.445
I have a motion to dismiss
marked up for this afternoon.

10:37.445 --> 10:40.371
In the meantime, he's noticed
a depo for judge Hooper.

10:40.371 --> 10:41.524
Oh, great.

10:41.524 --> 10:44.359
And who's representing
this charming man?

10:44.359 --> 10:46.468
That's the most fun part of all.

10:46.468 --> 10:49.634
I'm representing myself,
Shirley, like Gideon.

10:49.634 --> 10:52.339
I hope you'll all join me
for judge Hooper's deposition.

10:52.339 --> 10:54.500
Refreshments will,
of course, be served.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.687
Oh, it's all too delicious
for words, don't you think?

11:02.029 --> 11:04.029
I've got a caterer coming in 20 minutes,

11:04.029 --> 11:07.197
and I want the conference room
clean and I mean…

11:07.343 --> 11:11.863
Mr Jones, would you please explain
what a death-qualified jury is?

11:11.863 --> 11:13.110
During <i>voir dire</i>,

11:13.110 --> 11:15.383
jurors are asked the so-called
Witherspoon questions,

11:15.383 --> 11:16.935
named for the supreme court decision

11:16.935 --> 11:20.159
that determined the process
for jury selection in a capital case.

11:20.159 --> 11:21.366
According to Witherspoon,

11:21.366 --> 11:25.232
jurors who simply have a general objection
to the death penalty cannot be kept off,

11:25.232 --> 11:27.453
but anyone who would always
voted against the death penalty

11:27.453 --> 11:29.451
under any circumstances can be.

11:29.451 --> 11:31.833
–And Mr Espenson was on this jury?
–Yes.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.282
He declared in his questionnaire

11:33.282 --> 11:36.834
that he had no objection to the death
penalty under any circumstances.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.285
We learned later that this was a lie.

11:39.285 --> 11:40.262
I'm curious,

11:40.262 --> 11:42.852
when you're trying someone
accused of larceny,

11:42.852 --> 11:46.293
do you ask potential jurors
if they oppose jail time?

11:46.293 --> 11:47.096
No.

11:47.096 --> 11:49.924
Do you ask them if they oppose
fines or community service

11:49.924 --> 11:51.936
or giving the victim restitution?
–No.

11:51.936 --> 11:55.675
So there is no such thing
as a jail-qualified jury

11:55.675 --> 11:57.977
or a fine-him-$1,000-qualified jury,

11:57.977 --> 12:01.509
a make-him-pick-up-trash–
on-the-highway-qualified jury?

12:01.509 --> 12:02.312
No, there's not.

12:02.312 --> 12:05.026
And yet there is a death-qualified jury.

12:05.026 --> 12:06.564
I wonder why that is.

12:06.564 --> 12:09.758
Could it be that a jury made up of people
favoring the death penalty

12:09.758 --> 12:12.209
is more prone to convict
in the first place?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.321
–There's no evidence of that.
–Come on.

12:14.321 --> 12:15.875
I have many prosecutor friends.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.458
They tell me once you have
your death-qualified jury,

12:18.458 --> 12:19.719
your work is pretty much done.

12:19.719 --> 12:20.678
–Objection.
–Sustained.

12:20.678 --> 12:23.616
If you have 12 people who you know
are ready to kill somebody,

12:23.616 --> 12:26.443
I bet that “presumed innocent” idea
is far less problematic.

12:26.443 --> 12:28.348
–Objection.
–Sustained.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.094
Uh, it seems that, um…

12:34.094 --> 12:38.925
none of, uh, Daniel,
uh, ended up where…

12:38.925 --> 12:40.743
I assure you, we're investigating.

12:40.743 --> 12:43.817
What do you mean, none of him?

12:43.817 --> 12:47.491
Mr Post's cadaver
has apparently been stolen.

12:47.491 --> 12:51.675
We suspect his parts have found
their way into the black market.

12:51.675 --> 12:52.826
The black market?

12:52.826 --> 12:55.668
The very place Daniel did his shopping.

12:55.668 --> 12:57.267
Sorry.

12:57.267 --> 13:01.476
We think we have a lead
as to who stole him.

13:07.014 --> 13:08.162
Your mother?

13:08.162 --> 13:11.072
Yes. It seems we're getting serious.

13:11.072 --> 13:12.236
I want you to meet her.

13:12.236 --> 13:13.800
I'm not good with mothers.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.565
You'll make the effort with mine.

13:15.565 --> 13:17.653
Is she a little person?

13:17.653 --> 13:19.082
Does that matter?

13:19.082 --> 13:22.301
Of course not.
You know how I love them so.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.522
Bethany…

13:23.522 --> 13:27.779
I'm not the kind of guy
that girls take home to their mother.

13:27.779 --> 13:29.591
I tend to…

13:29.591 --> 13:32.585
you know, hit on them.

13:33.161 --> 13:35.214
You'll meet my mother, Denny,

13:35.214 --> 13:39.158
you'll be nice to her
and dignified.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.768
Did your wife ever say to you
that I was a pedophile?

13:43.768 --> 13:44.569
No.

13:44.569 --> 13:48.041
Did she ever indicate that she
believed me to be a pedophile?

13:48.041 --> 13:49.782
No.

13:50.441 --> 13:54.643
Do you find it odd that your
beautiful wife, may she rest in peace,

13:54.643 --> 14:00.259
would tell Scott Little that
she thought I was a pedophile
and never say that to you?

14:00.259 --> 14:03.406
My suspicion is she never
said that to Scott Little.

14:03.406 --> 14:04.557
Just a theory,

14:04.557 --> 14:08.320
but my bet is his lawyers convinced him
to drop the pedophile tag

14:08.320 --> 14:11.562
to better set you up as a red herring
as my wife's killer.

14:11.562 --> 14:15.351
Did you ever say anything to
these despicable lawyer people

14:15.351 --> 14:19.271
that could lead them to think
I killed your wife, God rest her soul?

14:19.271 --> 14:21.811
There's nothing I told them
in support of their theory

14:21.811 --> 14:24.219
that you were the killer.

14:26.929 --> 14:29.745
–Well, that seemed worthless.
–Maybe.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.914
What basis did you have for
suggesting him as the killer?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.258
–What basis?
–Yes.

14:34.258 --> 14:36.752
She got a restraining order
against him. He's certifiable.

14:36.752 --> 14:40.936
Was there evidence at all
that he could have done it
or that he was a pedophile?

14:40.936 --> 14:42.879
You representing him or me
in this, Brad?

14:42.879 --> 14:44.512
I'm just asking you the questions

14:44.512 --> 14:47.243
that he'll be asking you
if this ever goes to trial, Jeff.

14:47.243 --> 14:50.240
This goes to trial,
one of us is a pretty terrible lawyer.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.935
Our only defense is
civil disobedience, Jerry,

14:52.935 --> 14:55.142
and it's not a particularly
legal one at that.

14:55.142 --> 14:58.448
You need to be sincere
up there, and passionate.

14:58.448 --> 15:02.870
Melissa, I wrote a memorandum
on civil disobedience last year.

15:02.870 --> 15:04.952
I need…
what's happening here?

15:04.952 --> 15:06.932
I've been reassigned
to a different lawyer, Alan.

15:06.932 --> 15:08.991
I'm no longer your assistant.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.345
What are you talking about?

15:10.345 --> 15:13.408
I'll still be at the firm.
I've just been reassigned.

15:13.408 --> 15:15.745
Reassigned to whom?

15:15.745 --> 15:18.429
Jeffrey Coho.

15:19.337 --> 15:20.933
Melissa, what's going on?

15:20.933 --> 15:22.639
What's going on, Alan,

15:22.639 --> 15:26.080
is I'm not comfortable discovering you
in closets photography buffing

15:26.080 --> 15:29.466
or walking into your office finding
some sex doctor measuring your pants

15:29.466 --> 15:35.208
or smelling the waft of maple syrup
after you've tried cases
against old girlfriends.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.647
What's going on is I've had enough.

15:38.647 --> 15:39.915
I see.

15:39.915 --> 15:44.005
And how did you happen to end up
with this Jeffrey Coho?

15:44.005 --> 15:46.931
Oh. We clicked.

15:52.880 --> 15:57.470
This is where a crisp, little squeal
works particularly well for me.

16:06.555 --> 16:08.427
–Ms Bauer.
–Yeah?

16:08.427 --> 16:12.682
I am pleased to report
we have recovered Mr Post.

16:12.682 --> 16:14.264
–Really?
–Not all of him,

16:14.264 --> 16:16.504
but, uh, you know,
if you'd like to pay your respects.

16:16.504 --> 16:18.220
Um…

16:18.220 --> 16:19.277
what have you got?

16:19.277 --> 16:22.972
Wll, uh, so far, and the search is
by no means complete, of course,

16:22.972 --> 16:26.955
but, uh, so far,
we, we have his, uh, spleen.

16:26.955 --> 16:29.024
That's it, his spleen?

16:29.024 --> 16:29.943
Yeah.

16:29.943 --> 16:32.253
But we're positive it's him.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.476
More than half of the world's countries
have outlawed capital punishment.

16:42.476 --> 16:46.191
Virtually all of the industrialized
democracies have eliminated it.

16:46.191 --> 16:48.756
The five countries that
execute the most people are,

16:48.756 --> 16:51.771
in order, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia,

16:51.771 --> 16:54.730
the United states and Pakistan.

16:54.730 --> 16:56.645
Is that the company we want to keep?

16:56.645 --> 16:58.250
So to be clear,

16:58.250 --> 17:01.532
you are completely opposed
to the death penalty.
–I am.

17:01.532 --> 17:05.157
And yet, when you were given
the juror questionnaire to fill out,

17:05.157 --> 17:06.383
you said you weren't.

17:06.383 --> 17:07.507
Yes.

17:07.507 --> 17:08.464
Why, Jerry?

17:08.464 --> 17:10.679
Because I know how the system works.

17:10.679 --> 17:14.010
If you admit you oppose
capital punishment,

17:14.010 --> 17:15.688
they keep you off the jury.

17:15.688 --> 17:18.413
Having only pro-death penalty
people on the jury

17:18.413 --> 17:20.741
is completely unfair to the defendant,

17:20.741 --> 17:23.222
which is why I committed
an act of civil disobedience,

17:23.222 --> 17:27.971
to call attention to the gross
unfairness of my sexual surrogate.

17:28.306 --> 17:31.554
I mean the jury selection process!

17:41.416 --> 17:44.437
Oh, it just came out.

17:47.823 --> 17:49.674
Jerry…

17:50.084 --> 17:55.104
I know you know that perjury
in federal court is serious.

17:55.104 --> 17:58.539
What I'm not sure you appreciate…

17:58.539 --> 18:02.588
this case you were a juror on…

18:02.588 --> 18:06.418
it was of enormous importance
to the government.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.710
It was an opportunity to bring the death
penalty to a state that doesn't have it.

18:10.710 --> 18:13.912
As as far as they're concerned…

18:13.912 --> 18:18.742
you ruined some…

18:18.742 --> 18:21.898
very big plans.

18:21.898 --> 18:27.578
This sounds like a preamble
to a very bad prognosis.

18:27.578 --> 18:32.022
I've talked to Denny,
Shirley, Paul Lewiston.

18:32.022 --> 18:37.992
I've had a lot of people trying to
pull strings behind the scenes.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.100
This case is not going away.

18:42.678 --> 18:45.737
But I expect that…

18:46.828 --> 18:49.708
you are.

18:50.987 --> 18:52.769
We have no defense, Jerry.

18:52.769 --> 18:57.946
You flat-out committed perjury.

19:06.873 --> 19:08.668
Okay.

19:11.370 --> 19:14.067
Can I say good-bye to my mother?

19:14.067 --> 19:17.733
You're not going away this minute.

19:17.982 --> 19:21.504
I'll give the closing and…

19:21.504 --> 19:26.580
I guess, beg the jury
to ignore the law.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.399
And…

19:30.888 --> 19:32.975
we'll see.

19:44.019 --> 19:47.008
Do not tuck your napkin
into your collar.

19:47.008 --> 19:48.495
I will be mortified.

19:48.495 --> 19:50.053
Do not smoke your cigar.

19:50.053 --> 19:55.705
Do not make any Clintonian jokes
as to where the cigar has been.

19:55.705 --> 19:56.804
What can I do?

19:56.804 --> 19:59.785
Just be nice and get through it.

20:00.070 --> 20:01.780
You seem on edge.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.537
Of course I'm on edge.
It's my mother.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.637
Oh, God, and here she comes.

20:07.637 --> 20:09.653
Hi, honey.

20:10.354 --> 20:11.911
Sorry I'm late.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.921
Hi. Bella…

20:15.796 --> 20:17.826
Bella.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.874
Denny?

20:19.874 --> 20:22.714
You two know each other?

20:24.836 --> 20:28.559
You're dating Denny Crane.
Why didn't you tell me?

20:28.559 --> 20:31.227
I wanted it to be a surprise.

20:31.227 --> 20:33.052
What's going on?

20:33.052 --> 20:37.202
Well, Denny and I were once…

20:37.402 --> 20:39.630
Engaged.

20:41.353 --> 20:43.458
Surprise.

20:48.719 --> 20:50.465
He had no alibi
the night of the murder.

20:50.465 --> 20:52.711
Fresh flowers from his garden
were found on her nightstand.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.742
It would have been legal malpractice
for Jeffrey Coho

20:54.742 --> 20:58.731
not to focus the jury on Lincoln Meyer
as a possible suspect.

20:58.731 --> 21:00.165
Mr Meyer.

21:00.165 --> 21:01.912
Well…

21:02.050 --> 21:04.183
he implied I was a pedophile,

21:04.183 --> 21:06.706
a freak who should be registered
as a sex offender

21:06.706 --> 21:08.738
when I have committed no such offense.

21:08.738 --> 21:11.340
And even if I had,
which I most certainly have not,

21:11.340 --> 21:14.611
to suggest that I'm a killer, a murderer?

21:14.611 --> 21:17.427
That Gracie Jane woman reported it
in front of millions of people,

21:17.427 --> 21:19.148
and I was damaged.

21:19.148 --> 21:21.378
What about this peeping Tom crap?

21:21.378 --> 21:24.792
I am an open and notorious peepy.

21:24.792 --> 21:27.032
Why, when I would send her flowers,
I used to write,

21:27.032 --> 21:29.541
“with love from your little peepy.”

21:29.541 --> 21:32.082
And she liked having a peepy,
and even if she didn't,

21:32.082 --> 21:36.325
it doesn't give these lawyer people
a right to aver that I'm a killer.

21:36.325 --> 21:40.450
I mean, look at me, judge,
I'm damaged.

21:50.814 --> 21:52.967
That, that's a spleen?

21:52.967 --> 21:54.605
Are you sure it's him?

21:54.605 --> 21:55.564
Positive.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.198
We did a tissue match.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.561
I'll give you a moment alone.

22:11.715 --> 22:13.811
I can't get closure with a spleen.
This is not working.

22:13.811 --> 22:16.654
Look, Denise,
I think what you need to do is

22:16.654 --> 22:19.611
go sit somewhere in a quiet place,
maybe a church,

22:19.611 --> 22:23.448
and grieve for the man you loved.

22:23.670 --> 22:25.220
More good news.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.892
The FBI made an arrest.

22:26.892 --> 22:30.261
Harold Pines, he's been arrested before
for the commercialization of body parts.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.874
He's in custody.
What's more,

22:31.874 --> 22:36.907
the very lead that led to his arrest has also
led to the recovery of most of your fiancé.

22:36.907 --> 22:38.436
He's got a kidney in L.A.,

22:38.436 --> 22:41.351
His liver is on a plane
as we speak coming back from Topeka,

22:41.351 --> 22:44.574
his small intestine is waiting
to clear customs in Ottawa,

22:44.574 --> 22:47.508
and here in my hands…

22:48.808 --> 22:51.220
his heart.

22:52.465 --> 22:55.522
–That's Daniel's heart?
–It is.

22:55.522 --> 22:57.444
What about his head?

22:57.444 --> 22:59.846
The head is still at large.

23:05.033 --> 23:05.952
Her mother?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.901
It was a hundred years ago.
It shouldn't count.

23:07.901 --> 23:10.547
–How did Bethany take it?
–Not well.

23:10.547 --> 23:12.172
She bit me.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.875
Should I flee?
Should I move to Canada?

23:14.875 --> 23:16.442
–Jerry…
–I can't take prison, Alan.

23:16.442 --> 23:18.331
It wouldn't be
an hospitable place for me.

23:18.331 --> 23:20.306
Jerry, I cannot maintain
we'll win this trial,

23:20.306 --> 23:25.492
but I give you my word, I'll do everything
I can to keep you out of prison.

23:30.149 --> 23:31.668
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

23:31.668 --> 23:33.045
Brad!

23:33.565 --> 23:35.721
Clerk just called.
Judge Potts has his ruling.

23:35.721 --> 23:36.663
Let's go.

23:36.663 --> 23:39.461
I'm informed you
and my assistant have “clicked.”

23:39.461 --> 23:42.471
I'm sorry.
You are again?

23:43.831 --> 23:47.608
I don't like having my assistant
poached like a cow or an egg,

23:47.608 --> 23:53.775
and I especially don't like learning that
you and she are “clicking” behind my back.

23:55.145 --> 23:57.098
You know…

23:57.327 --> 24:00.673
I'm really not feeling the love here.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.278
Would you, um, give us some privacy?

24:13.278 --> 24:15.595
Sure.
I'll be right down the hall.

24:15.595 --> 24:17.435
Thank you.

24:21.534 --> 24:22.824
You a cop?

24:22.824 --> 24:25.921
No, Mr Pines.
I'm a lawyer.

24:25.921 --> 24:28.322
I was engaged to a man
named Daniel Post,

24:28.322 --> 24:31.168
whose body was stolen
either by you or an accomplice.

24:31.168 --> 24:32.752
Um…

24:32.752 --> 24:33.961
I don't know anything.

24:33.961 --> 24:35.404
That's not true, Mr Pines.

24:35.404 --> 24:37.944
You've been arrested in the past
for commercialization of body parts,

24:37.944 --> 24:40.633
and you run a million-dollar
skin harvesting ring.

24:40.633 --> 24:43.432
Look, lady, I'm not
gonna talk to you, okay?

24:43.432 --> 24:46.868
I just want to know
where his head is.

24:50.133 --> 24:55.014
I need to…
say good-bye.

24:55.014 --> 25:03.673
I'm not here looking for evidence
so much as for my lover's head.

25:06.085 --> 25:07.878
I'd like to help, okay?

25:07.878 --> 25:11.776
Obviously, I got my own problems.

25:11.982 --> 25:15.751
How about you retain me as counsel?

25:15.751 --> 25:18.068
–I'm sorry? –That way,
anything you say is privileged.

25:18.068 --> 25:20.747
I can't repeat it.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.812
Please.

25:24.541 --> 25:27.029
So you'd be my lawyer?

25:27.029 --> 25:31.813
For the purpose of this discussion,
I'm your lawyer.

25:37.841 --> 25:40.581
All right, I don't know
for sure, okay?

25:40.581 --> 25:45.267
There's this house in Salem. It's famous
in an underground kind of way.

25:47.403 --> 25:50.131
For Halloween, uh…

25:50.496 --> 25:53.779
they like to do it up
for real, you know,

25:53.779 --> 25:56.487
like a haunted house.

25:56.487 --> 25:59.710
They like to get themselves
some real heads.

25:59.710 --> 26:03.698
Now I don't know
if your fiancé's there,

26:03.698 --> 26:05.768
but…

26:10.026 --> 26:12.383
If you're against the death penalty,

26:12.383 --> 26:15.114
you can call your congressman,
protest in the street,

26:15.114 --> 26:16.823
start a blog, publish a book.

26:16.823 --> 26:20.026
There are countless ways
to get your point across.

26:20.026 --> 26:23.172
Committing perjury isn't one of them.

26:23.172 --> 26:26.825
Obstructing justice isn't one of them.

26:26.825 --> 26:28.652
Mr Espenson lied.

26:28.652 --> 26:30.203
He defrauded the court.

26:30.203 --> 26:33.074
His actions were an insult to that court

26:33.074 --> 26:37.128
as well as everyone who believes
in our system of justice.

26:37.128 --> 26:41.162
You are now part of that system.

26:41.162 --> 26:42.905
Do your duty.

26:42.905 --> 26:46.837
Send Mr Espenson to jail.

27:02.157 --> 27:06.531
Let's forget all about
capital punishment for a minute

27:06.531 --> 27:09.127
and look at this another way.

27:09.127 --> 27:13.928
Say a small town is having
a community meeting to vote

27:13.928 --> 27:17.074
on whether or not
to build a big incinerator.

27:17.074 --> 27:20.046
But before the selectmen
let you into the meeting,

27:20.046 --> 27:22.831
they ask you how you feel
about incinerators,

27:22.831 --> 27:24.490
and if you're opposed to them,

27:24.490 --> 27:26.196
you don't get to go to the meeting.

27:26.196 --> 27:29.453
Does that seem fair to any of you?

27:29.453 --> 27:34.575
Don't we want all sides represented
at a community meeting?

27:34.575 --> 27:37.910
Jury selection is supposed
to work the same way.

27:37.910 --> 27:42.532
All of you, in theory, should represent
a cross section of the community.

27:42.532 --> 27:46.049
Well, here we are in Massachusetts,
a state with no death penalty.

27:46.049 --> 27:48.068
One would assume therefore

27:48.068 --> 27:51.761
that the majority of the community
is opposed to capital punishment.

27:51.761 --> 27:55.030
But anyone who holds that view
cannot be a juror

27:55.030 --> 27:56.982
in a federal death penalty case.

27:56.982 --> 28:00.397
This isn't just weeding out people
with idiosyncratic opinions.

28:00.397 --> 28:02.834
This is weeding out the majority.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.130
It's strategic.

28:05.130 --> 28:07.774
We all know intuitively,

28:07.774 --> 28:12.278
if you start talking about punishment
before a trial even begins,

28:12.278 --> 28:18.338
you're putting the idea of guilt
in the forefront of everyone's mind.

28:18.338 --> 28:23.456
Yet, presumption of innocence…

28:23.456 --> 28:27.607
is the foundation
of our whole justice system.

28:27.607 --> 28:31.264
Without that, we're no better
than totalitarian states

28:31.264 --> 28:37.098
who imprison and execute people
on the whim of an all-powerful leader.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.804
Jerry Espenson…

28:47.661 --> 28:52.799
Jerry Espenson is my friend.

28:52.799 --> 28:57.023
I care for him dearly.

28:57.023 --> 28:59.215
And…

28:59.492 --> 29:05.144
I know him to be, fundamentally,
a law-abiding man

29:05.144 --> 29:09.811
who simply saw an injustice
and tried to do something about it.

29:09.811 --> 29:15.310
If he's guilty of anything…

29:15.310 --> 29:21.282
it's of appealing to
his sense of fairness.

29:22.687 --> 29:27.711
Now, I suppose…

29:28.112 --> 29:31.269
he's appealing to yours.

30:06.851 --> 30:10.183
Hey, give me a second.

30:26.885 --> 30:28.909
Lincoln.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.269
Hello, Mr Dirty Mouth.

30:31.269 --> 30:35.382
Come to make me an offer of settlement
before the judge rules against you?

30:35.382 --> 30:38.083
I'm not surprised.

30:38.083 --> 30:41.337
I've been watching you
for a bit, Lincoln…

30:41.978 --> 30:44.106
sitting here.

30:44.106 --> 30:45.407
Really?

30:45.407 --> 30:50.473
–Are you a bit of a peepy?
–You seemed sad.

30:50.758 --> 30:53.351
You seemed…

30:54.064 --> 30:56.720
alone, I guess.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.732
Did I?

30:59.516 --> 31:02.401
You must have misread me.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.227
What's going on, Lincoln?

31:07.227 --> 31:10.616
This lawsuit, what are you doing?

31:10.988 --> 31:14.529
Is this just about attention?

31:15.922 --> 31:20.232
You don't think I have feelings.

31:20.232 --> 31:25.139
Those things you said
about me in court…

31:25.725 --> 31:30.575
I have feelings, Mr Coho.

31:31.522 --> 31:33.850
I'm sorry.

31:34.251 --> 31:39.512
I was just doing whatever I could
to defend my client.

31:39.836 --> 31:42.721
It wasn't personal.

31:44.037 --> 31:47.888
It was very personal.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.499
<i>President Bush is back
in the White house today</i>

31:54.499 --> 31:58.208
<i>after a 2½-week vacation
at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.</i>

31:58.208 --> 32:02.845
<i>The president travelled via Air Force One
arriving in Washington early this morning.</i>

32:02.845 --> 32:06.805
<i>The president has a full schedule
in the coming days.</i>

32:07.908 --> 32:11.814
I used to tell her about
the great Denny Crane.

32:11.814 --> 32:15.895
It's one reason, I think,
she ended up going to law school.

32:16.070 --> 32:19.479
She had no idea that
I used to sleep with you.

32:19.479 --> 32:24.524
Just as I had no idea
that you now sleep with…

32:25.611 --> 32:27.088
How is she?

32:27.088 --> 32:29.976
I can't get her to talk to me.

32:30.903 --> 32:33.252
She's pretty upset.

32:34.205 --> 32:36.439
She bite you?

32:36.902 --> 32:40.568
She bites. I know this.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.710
I don't want you to see
my daughter anymore, Denny.

32:44.710 --> 32:46.877
Come on, Bella.

32:47.095 --> 32:51.931
I can't see someone because
she turns out to be your daughter?

32:52.195 --> 32:56.579
See, it also turns out
she's yours.

33:02.826 --> 33:04.042
Is she sure?

33:04.042 --> 33:07.641
No. We're gonna have to have
a paternity test.

33:07.641 --> 33:11.316
Can two full-size people have a midget?

33:11.316 --> 33:13.401
–Does Bethany know?
–I don't know.

33:13.401 --> 33:18.188
God, it's one thing to date a dwarf,
but to have fathered one…

33:18.188 --> 33:20.410
Denny, I bet Bethany does know.

33:20.410 --> 33:22.192
Why?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.949
Oh, God.

33:25.949 --> 33:28.289
Afraid so.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.137
Hi, honey.

33:31.730 --> 33:33.671
Who's your daddy?

33:37.166 --> 33:40.475
Statements made by lawyers in court
are immune from defamation liability.

33:40.475 --> 33:42.464
This is a longstanding exception.

33:42.464 --> 33:44.810
Statements made outside of court, however,

33:44.810 --> 33:46.758
are afforded no such protection.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.812
Mr Coho, you repeated
these things to the press.

33:49.812 --> 33:52.186
You enjoy no privilege there.

33:52.186 --> 33:54.520
However, again,

33:54.520 --> 33:56.882
it is my view you were only
commenting to the media

33:56.882 --> 33:59.780
on matters that occurred
inside the courtroom.

33:59.780 --> 34:03.543
And because the privilege
does extend to that situation,

34:03.543 --> 34:07.215
I'm going to grant
the defendant's motion to dismiss.

34:08.574 --> 34:10.058
And, Mr Meyer,

34:10.058 --> 34:12.150
before you decide
to go sue anybody else,

34:12.150 --> 34:17.752
you might consider that truth
is also a defense to defamation.

34:18.099 --> 34:23.002
For my money, you appear to be
a seriously disturbed man.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.087
This court is adjourned.

34:43.193 --> 34:44.856
Boo.

34:46.295 --> 34:47.569
That's perfect.

34:47.569 --> 34:50.648
I have to go to Salem later today.
Maybe you should come with me.

34:50.648 --> 34:52.168
What's in Salem?

34:52.168 --> 34:55.150
Possibly, um…

34:55.150 --> 34:57.801
Daniel's head.

34:58.229 --> 35:03.676
In some ghoulish haunted house.
Evidently they, uh…

35:03.676 --> 35:05.870
they use real cadavers.

35:05.870 --> 35:09.316
Daniel's head is in a haunted house?

35:09.316 --> 35:11.950
Maybe.

35:14.599 --> 35:17.444
You have plans later?

35:30.565 --> 35:32.670
Don't ask, okay?

35:32.670 --> 35:34.950
The defendant will please rise.

35:35.591 --> 35:39.008
Madam Foreperson, the jury
has reached a unanimous verdict?

35:39.008 --> 35:40.639
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

35:40.639 --> 35:43.715
“In the matter of the United states
vs Jerald Espenson”

35:43.715 --> 35:45.110
“on one count of perjury,”

35:45.110 --> 35:49.425
“we the jury find the defendant
Jerald Espenson”

35:49.425 --> 35:50.731
“not guilty.”

35:50.731 --> 35:52.320
What?

35:53.580 --> 35:56.832
–Members of the jury, this concludes
your jury service.
–Oh, my God.

35:56.832 --> 35:59.792
You are dismissed.
This court stands adjourned.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.512
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

36:01.512 --> 36:04.335
Thank you! Thank you!

36:11.175 --> 36:14.183
<i>♫ Yes, I know it's a drag
it's a doggone shame ♫</i>

36:14.183 --> 36:15.851
<i>♫ I've danced the same dance, ♫</i>

36:15.851 --> 36:18.627
<i>♫ felt the same pain
I had the same passion ♫</i>

36:18.627 --> 36:22.202
<i>♫ and done the same things as you ♫</i>

36:22.609 --> 36:26.264
<i>♫ yeah, you better believe me,
it's true I've worn the same shoe, ♫</i>

36:26.264 --> 36:29.061
<i>♫ walked the same walk
at least a time or two ♫</i>

36:29.061 --> 36:30.743
<i>♫ and I heard the same things ♫</i>

36:30.743 --> 36:34.257
<i>♫ done the same things as you ♫</i>

36:34.904 --> 36:37.532
<i>♫ in this time ♫</i>

36:37.532 --> 36:40.450
<i>♫ this time that we live in ♫</i>

36:40.450 --> 36:43.154
<i>♫ is easy to give in ♫</i>

36:43.425 --> 36:44.846
You won.

36:44.846 --> 36:47.054
Don't ask me how.
The jury must have just—

36:47.054 --> 36:49.347
Ignored the law like total commies.

36:49.347 --> 36:50.387
Exactly.

36:50.387 --> 36:52.589
Maybe they had reservations
about the death penalty in general.

36:52.589 --> 36:55.272
See, that's why we're
perceived as soft on terror.

36:55.272 --> 36:57.924
We can't even kill our own people.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.653
Where's your daughter?

36:59.653 --> 37:02.076
The paternity test is still pending.

37:02.076 --> 37:04.569
–Who's your daughter?
–Never mind.

37:04.569 --> 37:07.220
My stomach feels bloated.

37:07.220 --> 37:09.819
I hope I'm not getting my period.

37:10.863 --> 37:13.196
<i>♫ Give it time ♫</i>

37:13.196 --> 37:15.818
<i>♫ time to live and die ♫</i>

37:16.213 --> 37:17.807
What?

37:18.544 --> 37:22.531
Sally is gone.
Melissa is gone.

37:25.645 --> 37:27.960
Forget it, horny toad.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.181
Oh, brother.

37:51.928 --> 37:55.781
This is one of the most ridiculous things
I've ever done in my life.

37:55.781 --> 37:57.773
Let's go in here.

38:10.854 --> 38:12.261
What was that?

38:13.270 --> 38:15.981
What kind of cult gets off
on something like this?

38:15.981 --> 38:17.810
I don't know.

38:18.174 --> 38:20.623
–You suppose that's real?
–I don't know.

38:20.623 --> 38:23.312
Why aren't we letting
the police do this?

38:23.312 --> 38:25.704
Uh, because…

38:25.899 --> 38:28.519
because it's privileged.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.167
Denise, none of them
look like Daniel.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.241
There's gotta be a better way
to get closure than this.

38:42.241 --> 38:44.694
Well, we're here now,
so let's just get through it.

38:44.694 --> 38:49.644
Shouldn't you be grieving for this man
instead of out looking for his head?

38:54.471 --> 38:57.900
Oh, I thought for a minute
it was him.

39:03.023 --> 39:04.693
–Oh, my…
–What?

39:04.693 --> 39:05.929
No, I…

39:05.929 --> 39:08.649
–What?
–Nothing. I just, for a second, in that box,

39:08.649 --> 39:12.127
I thought I saw a head
that resembled Da…

39:12.127 --> 39:15.448
just my imagination.

39:17.815 --> 39:19.608
Oh, my God.

39:59.895 --> 40:04.533
Oops. I didn't see you there, judge.

40:11.343 --> 40:15.879
I have long fantasized getting
in one of the Lennon Sisters' dresses.
<i>(group of the 50's, 3 sisters)</i>

40:15.879 --> 40:17.715
Me, too.

40:19.502 --> 40:23.266
Ever wonder how you'd be
as a woman, Denny?

40:23.551 --> 40:25.837
I'd be a lesbian.

40:26.161 --> 40:27.987
Yes.

40:29.009 --> 40:32.169
You think we'd look
at the world differently?

40:32.169 --> 40:34.397
I mean, it is a man's world still.

40:34.397 --> 40:39.194
I would imagine at a minimum,
we'd be more vulnerable.

40:39.194 --> 40:40.579
And physically.

40:40.579 --> 40:43.562
We'd have our own breasts to fondle.

40:45.797 --> 40:48.556
I bet you'd feel differently
about capital punishment.

40:48.556 --> 40:49.449
Why?

40:49.449 --> 40:53.025
Denny, you get emotional over
the odd bowel movement.

40:53.025 --> 40:54.873
Suppose you gave birth?

40:54.873 --> 41:01.708
I would think your appreciation
for human life…

41:02.218 --> 41:10.871
Franz Kafka said the meaning
of life is that it ends.

41:10.871 --> 41:14.666
One day you're here,
and the next…

41:20.612 --> 41:22.866
To Daniel Post.

41:23.382 --> 41:25.051
My loss.

41:25.051 --> 41:27.630
I didn't know you even knew him.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.721
I didn't.

41:32.323 --> 41:36.091
And from what I gather, my loss.

41:49.942 --> 41:51.852
You're not getting in this dress.

41:51.852 --> 41:57.639
<i>♫ Gotta take this sentimental journey ♫</i>

41:57.639 --> 42:00.807
<i>♫ Lennon Sisters' “Sentimental journey” ♫</i>

42:01.186 --> 42:03.632
