03:12.493 --> 03:15.696
For years I was relegated
to the ocean floor.

03:15.696 --> 03:20.534
Just a starfish stuck on a rock
while the world swam by.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.371
It was my rock bottom.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.039
But I was there.
And I liked that rock.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.441

As I was saying,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.082
there I was, stuck.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.619
And everyfishy who swam by
me was singing that one

03:38.619 --> 03:40.354
relentless song.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.973
Aww, I kind of like ENHYPEN.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.309

04:03.511 --> 04:05.313

they have in their heart

04:35.643 --> 04:38.045
will be replaced by mine.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.469
We know
it's not perfect timing.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.004
Wha--

11:11.004 --> 11:14.842
so we're not going
to be neighbors anymore?

11:14.842 --> 11:17.110
I know it's
a big change, Baby.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.212
But you two can still
visit each other.

11:19.212 --> 11:23.250
But Chomp City's all the way
across the whole wide water.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.187
How about those snackies?

11:27.187 --> 11:32.993
Thanks, but I
think I lost my appetite.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.795
I better flow home.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.297
Oh.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.042
Well, the dental office
is officially closed,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.644
and I'm ready
for a city adventure!

11:51.779 --> 11:52.980
Just think, Baby!

11:52.980 --> 11:55.015
It'll be a dream come true.

11:55.015 --> 12:00.120
You can even get your teeth
cleaned by the Dr. Sawtooth.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.689
Ironically, she's famous
for her gentle touch.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.793
Uh, Daddy, that's your dream.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.461
Oh, hehe, right.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.863
I know!

12:09.863 --> 12:12.099
What if--
and hear me out here--

12:12.099 --> 12:14.802
I stay behind
with Grandma and Grandpa!

12:14.802 --> 12:16.203
- Oh!

12:16.203 --> 12:17.871
Then I could help
if Grandpa gets a cramp

12:17.871 --> 12:19.406
and needs his fin cream!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.708
Or Grandma needs the Wi-Fi
password for her tablet!

12:21.809 --> 12:23.844
Or they both get
cold and no fishies

12:23.844 --> 12:25.112
here to knit them a scarf!

12:25.112 --> 12:26.880
Ooh, that sounds great.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.648
I do get cold
from time to time.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.884
Oof!

12:30.884 --> 12:32.585
You don't want
to stay with us, squiddo.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.355
Yeah, we're just going
to be sitting around telling

12:35.355 --> 12:37.825
each other long embellished
stories about our pasts

12:37.825 --> 12:40.060
that we've already
heard 300 times.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.595
Luckily,
I always forget them.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.732
C'mon, Baby.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.901
Chomp City will be great.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.302
And while we get
up on our fins,

12:49.302 --> 12:51.839
we'll get to stay
with my old friend Leah.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.107
Remember how much fun she is?

12:54.107 --> 12:57.444
Plus, you'll finally get
to meet her little pup Lannie.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.279
Leah Lanternshark?

12:59.279 --> 13:02.850
Hey, weren't you two in
a yacht rock group together?

13:06.253 --> 13:08.889
I try not to remember that.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.157
That's right!

13:10.157 --> 13:12.860
She was kicked out
for being too smooth.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.727
How's she doing?

13:14.862 --> 13:18.531
Oh, she's--well, actually,
I don't really know.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.500
It's been a while
since we caught up.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.036
So I guess we'll find
out and hopefully

13:23.036 --> 13:25.005
live to tell the tale, ha.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.439
It's no fair.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.708
I have to move away
from my best friend,

13:28.708 --> 13:31.044
and you get to live with yours.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.180
Try to think of it
as a new adventure.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.681
An adventure?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.049
Without William?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.784
Well, that's like
a shark without water.

13:37.885 --> 13:41.054
What if William makes a new
best friend while I'm gone?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.891
And they make new inside jokes?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.893
That I'm outside of!

13:45.893 --> 13:48.896
I'll be outside the jokes!

13:54.902 --> 13:56.636
Don't worry, squiddo.

13:56.636 --> 14:01.241
At my age, I found that true
blue fin-ship conquers all.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.544
Even a move across
the whole wide water.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.549
♪ Packing up

14:09.549 --> 14:11.384

14:17.157 --> 14:18.926
Good mood?
Ha!

14:18.926 --> 14:20.327
Try great mood!

14:20.327 --> 14:22.129
Because of how
great everything is!

14:22.129 --> 14:23.496
Great!

14:23.496 --> 14:25.298
I'm so glad you're excited.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.935
And remember, only pack
the things you need.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.569
Oh, I am.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.637
Oof!

14:33.706 --> 14:35.943
Baby.

14:35.943 --> 14:36.977
What?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.411
He needs his best friend!

14:38.411 --> 14:41.781
- Yeah!
- Nice try, squiddos.

14:41.781 --> 14:45.152
I can't believe
you're really leaving.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.954
Me neither.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.056
But are you and I
the best friends

14:49.056 --> 14:53.260
in the whole wide water
gonna let that get us down?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.128
So I'm moving across
the seven seas.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.529
So what?

14:56.529 --> 14:59.866
A fin-ship like ours
is bigger than that!

14:59.967 --> 15:02.135
We took a vow, remember?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.470
Through thick and fin?

15:03.470 --> 15:07.007
Yeah!
In salt and fresh water.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.142
I'll always be by your side.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.310
Always!

15:10.310 --> 15:12.645
Mm, what was that?

15:14.214 --> 15:16.984
Er, at least symbolically.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.385
Here--

15:18.385 --> 15:20.420
Much better.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.126
Thanks for the moving
help, Mail Whale!

15:26.126 --> 15:27.995
You're welcome.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.198
Hooo-hooo-hoohoooo-hoo-hooo.

15:31.198 --> 15:35.502
Grandma, Grandpa,
I'll miss you.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.870
Oh, have fun, lil pup.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.008
It's sure going to be
a snooze fest around here

15:41.008 --> 15:42.875
without ya.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.450
Guess this is it, huh?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.652
Nope, not nearly.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.155
Because I have
a surprise for you--

15:55.155 --> 15:57.024
happy early birthday!

15:59.626 --> 16:02.229
Two tickets
to the Chomptacular!

16:02.229 --> 16:03.830
How?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.599
Let's just say
I know a shark.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.036
It's me, I'm the shark.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.771
William, when you come
visit me in Chomp City,

16:11.771 --> 16:15.042
we're going to be
front row for ENHYPEN!

16:15.042 --> 16:16.876
Front row?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.713
You think we'll get
to dance on stage with them?

16:20.713 --> 16:24.151
Um, obviously we'll get
to dance on stage with them.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.619
Aww, thank you, Baby.

16:26.619 --> 16:30.590
This is the jaw-somest
birthday present ever.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.064
Time to get flowing, lil pup.

16:44.704 --> 16:48.575
♪ I'll be there when
the tide starts turning ♪

16:48.575 --> 16:52.545
♪ I'll be there when
the waves stop curling ♪

16:52.545 --> 16:56.583

16:56.583 --> 17:01.921

17:01.921 --> 17:08.828
See you later,
best friend forever.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.300
- Bye, everyfishy!
- Bye, Baby!

17:13.300 --> 17:14.334
Goodbye!

17:14.334 --> 17:15.835
Oh, take care.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.405
What time is it?

17:18.405 --> 17:21.541
Party time.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.282
Chin up, lil pup.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.017
Everything will be fine.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.619
You'll see.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.589
All right, I just downloaded
this new app called Waterways.

17:36.589 --> 17:40.026
It'll get us there in
two shakes of a tail-fin!

17:40.127 --> 17:42.195
Whoo!

17:51.138 --> 17:55.242
Uh, that way!

17:55.242 --> 17:57.177
OK, maybe the other way!

18:01.248 --> 18:03.049
This can't be right.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.655
Ah! Neither can this!

18:09.722 --> 18:11.191
Look!

18:11.191 --> 18:13.393
Up ahead.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.994
Wow.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.164
Chomp City.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.193
Whew!

18:46.193 --> 18:47.860
We made it.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.902
Whoa.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.341
Wow, the sights.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.375
The sounds.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.343
The smells.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.817
City life, we're living it!

19:10.817 --> 19:12.219
- Hey.
- Pardon me!

19:12.219 --> 19:14.521
Whoop!
- Ey, I'm swimmin' here!

19:14.521 --> 19:16.289
Oof!

19:20.227 --> 19:24.964
Nothing a little
Baby Shark charm can't fix.

19:24.964 --> 19:29.336
I am truly, deeply sorry.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.839
Those puppy shark
eyes aren't going to cut

19:32.839 --> 19:35.074
it in Chomp City, squiddo.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.281
So I'm a
little out of my depth.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.482
Mommy, Daddy!

19:42.482 --> 19:44.951
Wait for me!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.619
How's my smile?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.989
Hmm, Abso-toothly perfect!

19:51.358 --> 19:54.861
Hmm, ugh, did Leah
forget we're coming today?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.729
Where are they?

19:58.265 --> 20:00.267
Right here!

20:00.267 --> 20:01.334
There she is!

20:01.334 --> 20:03.135
Long time, no hug!

20:03.135 --> 20:04.103
Leah!

20:04.103 --> 20:07.139
So small but so strong.

20:07.139 --> 20:10.543
I see you still
know how to make an entrance.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.179
Hi, Lannie.

20:13.179 --> 20:16.283
Gerald, you troublemaker.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.318
Hey, girl, hey!

20:18.318 --> 20:19.486
You remember this.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.020
Up high, down low!

20:21.020 --> 20:23.890
To the right, let it flow!

20:27.760 --> 20:29.061
And you!

20:29.061 --> 20:31.030
Come to Auntie Leah!

20:31.030 --> 20:32.865
Huh, didn't think
he called you "Auntie."

20:32.865 --> 20:34.233
He does now!

20:34.233 --> 20:36.369
Let Auntie Leah do
the shark check.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.839
Dorsal fin, check.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.343
Star mark, check.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.415
Tail--perfectly springy.

20:50.350 --> 20:54.754
Now it's about
time you two met.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.590
Baby, this is
my little pup Lannie!

20:57.590 --> 20:59.359
Uh, hi, Lannie!

20:59.359 --> 21:00.593
I'm Baby Shark.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.429
I know!
I mean, nice to eat you.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.863
Gah!

21:03.863 --> 21:06.433
I mean, nice to meet you. Yeah.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.735
Nice to meet you, too.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.036
I like your colors.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.838
We're lantern sharks,
so we glow!

21:11.838 --> 21:13.540
See? Angry!

21:13.540 --> 21:15.575
Happy!
Hungry.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.345
I guess you could say,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.814
Except, I don't have sleeves,
so you wouldn't say that.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.250
Get it together, Lannie.
Lock it down!

21:24.351 --> 21:27.720
No, no, that's very cool.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.221
Whaddaya say?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.424
Ready to dive in
and explore your new home?

21:31.424 --> 21:32.592
I guess so.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.060
You guess so?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.528
Nah, nah, nah, we gotta
do better than that.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.764

that in Chomp City,

Casa Leah y Lannie.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.100
Your new home.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.841
We definitely aren't
in Carnivore Cove anymore.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.144
This way!

23:32.144 --> 23:33.680
I'll show you our room.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.981
"Our" room?

23:34.981 --> 23:37.049
Look, I understand
Dr. Sawtooth is busy,

23:37.049 --> 23:40.720
but could she make an exception
for a fellow practitioner

23:40.720 --> 23:42.021
of the dental arts?

23:42.021 --> 23:45.592
Look at you, Mommy Shark,
back in the city.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.627
Wow, ya know,
it's been way too long.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.630
Yeah, I've been meaning
to visit, but you know,

23:50.630 --> 23:52.865
life always seems
to get in the way.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.167
Ugh. That pesky life.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.337
Well, catch-up time starts now.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.539
Totally.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.542
Let the catching up begin.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.210
- Yes!

24:04.210 --> 24:05.344
Oh, thank you!

24:05.344 --> 24:06.779
I'll take it!

24:06.779 --> 24:07.747
Mwah.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.916
Daddy's going to the dentist!

24:09.916 --> 24:11.818
Whoo--ah!

24:11.818 --> 24:13.986
That hurt!

24:17.890 --> 24:20.192
This is my bed,
and this one's yours!

24:20.192 --> 24:23.696
Unless you want mine, in which
case you can totally have it.

24:23.696 --> 24:24.997
Oh, that's OK.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.166
Thanks, though.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.601
OK, but the offer stands.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.537
Anything for my new best bud!

24:30.537 --> 24:34.306
Uh, I kinda already
have a best, best bud.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.342
But we can still be friends!

24:36.342 --> 24:37.744
Totally!

24:37.744 --> 24:40.346
Well, this is still
going to be jaw-some.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.414
It's like a forever sleepover!

24:42.549 --> 24:44.216
Just a warning--my mom
says I talk in my sleep.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.719
But I've never heard it, so--

24:53.259 --> 24:58.765
One day down, forever to go.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.080
But I'm just an understudy!

25:14.080 --> 25:15.682
- Huh?
- What?

25:15.682 --> 25:16.949
Me?

25:16.949 --> 25:19.451
Star in the off-off
Broadwave production

25:19.586 --> 25:21.854
of "Les Fisherables" tonight?

25:21.854 --> 25:26.926
♪ La la la la la
la la la ♪

25:36.903 --> 25:39.338
Ah!

25:39.338 --> 25:42.742
The Chomptacular.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.812
It's a beautiful day, Gillie.

25:45.812 --> 25:49.916
Have I ever told you how
much I appreciate you?

25:49.916 --> 25:51.984
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's happening?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.219
What is this?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.321
Are you happy?

25:55.321 --> 25:56.856
Well, why not?

25:56.856 --> 26:01.060
The sun is shining,
my star is rising--

26:01.060 --> 26:03.630
and Baby Shark is
in Chomp City, swimming

26:03.630 --> 26:05.331
ever closer to my trap.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.967
The only thing that can
break the Siren Stone's spell

26:07.967 --> 26:10.536
is the song of the catchiest
fish in the sea.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.939
So once I steal Baby
Shark's star mark,

26:12.939 --> 26:14.540
nothing will stand in my way.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.308
You're such a genius, Stariana.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.646
I mean, hiring Baby Shark's mom
to work for you to bring him

26:19.646 --> 26:22.448
closer, Elon Mollusk wishes.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.150
I know.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.685
Sometimes I think
I'm so smart that I

26:25.685 --> 26:27.253
could be really
successful if I just

26:27.253 --> 26:28.420
put in an honest day's work.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.056
But where's the fun in that?

26:30.056 --> 26:33.726
Once I steal Baby Shark's
musical life force,

26:33.726 --> 26:36.028
I will be unstoppable.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.965
My Chomptacular performance
will put everyfishy

26:38.965 --> 26:41.901
in the whole wide
water under my spell,

26:41.901 --> 26:46.372
and I will rule the ocean
as is my rightful destiny.

26:46.372 --> 26:50.309
BTDubs, what's the sitch with
tracking down the Siren Stone?

26:50.309 --> 26:51.410
Oh!

26:51.410 --> 26:53.112
Uh, It's going well!

26:53.112 --> 26:55.982
I have several promising
leads, and I've only

26:55.982 --> 26:58.050
had my identity stolen once.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.752
Good.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.826
Uh, where is
Mrs. Shark, anyway?

27:06.826 --> 27:08.695
Good morning!

27:08.695 --> 27:10.062
OK, so I have
our whole day planned out

27:10.062 --> 27:12.031
starting with your fave
breakfast sandwiches.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.265
And then--

27:13.265 --> 27:15.434
Planned out?
Leah, I'm running late.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.937
But you just got here.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.606
You really don't have
a day to hang out?

27:20.707 --> 27:22.008
Sorry.

27:22.008 --> 27:25.411
I promise we'll do
catch up time soon!

27:25.411 --> 27:28.180
Breakfast sando to-go it is!

27:32.418 --> 27:34.086
Oh, thank you.

27:34.086 --> 27:37.056
And, uh, keep him in one
piece while I'm out, OK?

27:37.056 --> 27:40.426
You have my solemn word.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.732
Now are we going
to be on good behavior?

27:45.732 --> 27:48.267
Welcome to the Driftwood Derby!

27:53.339 --> 27:54.540
Whoo-hoo!

27:54.540 --> 27:57.476
I'm gaining on you, Leah!

27:57.476 --> 27:58.778
Not in my house!

28:15.661 --> 28:17.396
Show me the light.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.399
Good. Good.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.468
Hm, no good.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.537
Coming through.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.174
- Hey, watch it.
- Whoa!

28:37.649 --> 28:41.954
Huh, must have gotten
mixed up with Baby's stuff.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.323
Mwah.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.092
Mrs. Shark!

28:46.092 --> 28:47.493
Thank gill-ness you're here.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.796
I'm Gillie, Stariana's
assistant and best friend.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.030
Assistant first,
best friend sec--

28:51.030 --> 28:54.166
There she is!

28:54.166 --> 28:57.837
Oh, nice to meet you both.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.638
Aww.

28:59.638 --> 29:02.208
This must be Baby Shark!

29:02.208 --> 29:03.810
You got those tickets
I sent, right?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.277
Yes, thank you again.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.880
He and his best friend
William are so, so excited,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.581
especially to see ENHYPEN.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.083
Haven't heard of them.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.552
Anyway, he should stop
by to get an autograph.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.455
I'd love to meet him.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.091
That's so kind of you.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.693
Oh, it's the
least I could do.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.831
Whoo-hoo!

29:28.000 --> 29:29.969
Ooh, I like your bracelet.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.337
Thanks!

29:31.337 --> 29:32.872
My best friend,
William has one, too.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.841
He lives back
in Carnivore Cove.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.175
Oh, cool.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.945
But, uh, hey, I know!

29:38.945 --> 29:41.047
How about we make up
a secret tail-shake?

29:41.047 --> 29:43.582
That is such a good idea.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.017
How do we do that?

29:45.017 --> 29:47.854
How about we shark
shimmy, patty-cake fin,

29:47.854 --> 29:49.355
do a spin, and--

29:49.355 --> 29:50.890
Whoa!

29:50.890 --> 29:54.593
That is not how
that usually goes.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.328
Ahh!

29:56.328 --> 29:57.563
Gotcha!

29:59.031 --> 30:01.400
Whew, isn't the Driftwood
Derby great, Baby?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.035
What could you be
doing in Carnivore Cove

30:03.035 --> 30:05.071
that's more fun than this?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.638
Oh, no!

30:06.638 --> 30:08.174
I almost forgot!

30:08.174 --> 30:11.043
all: * Happy birthday,
dear William ♪

30:11.043 --> 30:13.112
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

30:13.112 --> 30:14.613

30:14.613 --> 30:17.483
Bubble berry birthday
cake coming through!

30:17.483 --> 30:18.885
Make a wish.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.586
Hmm, hmm.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.854
Ah!

30:27.659 --> 30:29.428
Bravo.

30:29.428 --> 30:32.031
First slice

30:32.031 --> 30:33.099
Thanks, Mom.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.103
And look who it is--

30:37.103 --> 30:39.738
<i>Happy birthday, best friend!</i>

30:39.738 --> 30:40.873
Baby!

30:40.873 --> 30:42.708
I saved your spot for you.

30:42.708 --> 30:45.811
<i>Ooh, lemme get
some of that cake!</i>

30:45.811 --> 30:47.179
Mmm.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.216
Do I detect a hint
of bubbleberry?

30:51.650 --> 30:52.851
Hey, William!

30:52.851 --> 30:54.820
Wavy haberdashery!

30:58.024 --> 30:59.125
What?

30:59.125 --> 31:00.326
What did she say?

31:00.326 --> 31:02.061
"Wavy haberdashery"?

31:02.061 --> 31:05.597
<i>Oh, it's kinda
an inside joke.</i>

31:05.597 --> 31:08.167
An inside joke?

31:08.167 --> 31:10.802
Yeah, yeah, you--
you had to be there.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.939
<i>Oh, uh--</i>

31:12.939 --> 31:14.941
Sounds funny.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.009
Time to open presents!

31:17.009 --> 31:18.844
Ooh, mine first!

31:18.945 --> 31:20.079
Ooh!

31:20.079 --> 31:21.613
Uh, I gotta flow, Baby.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.949
Oh, OK.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.050
Uh, have fun!

31:24.050 --> 31:25.584
<i>You too!</i>

31:26.585 --> 31:28.154
It's official.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.156
He has inside jokes without me.

31:30.156 --> 31:33.592
My life is over.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.361
Hey, Baby!
Wanna race?

31:35.361 --> 31:36.462
I know you won
the first, second,

31:36.462 --> 31:37.663
and, well-- all seven rounds.

31:37.663 --> 31:38.965
But this one's mine!

31:38.965 --> 31:40.399
Oh, I can feel it in my fins.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.968
I'll take that action!

31:41.968 --> 31:43.835
Whoo!

31:52.311 --> 31:54.780
Somefishy's got
the birthday blues.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.348
Talk to me, bubba.

31:56.348 --> 32:01.053
It's just-- it wasn't
the same without Baby here.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.655
Hey, listen,
you're best friends.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.325
A little distance
can't change that.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.494
Thanks, Mom.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.396
You're like the wisest.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.764
And besides,
you'll see him again soon.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.834
Could it be?

32:15.834 --> 32:17.703
OK, we got
the party snackies,

32:17.703 --> 32:19.638
we got the glow
in the dark body paint,

32:19.638 --> 32:21.240
and you fishies
will never believe--

32:21.240 --> 32:23.042
Next door.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.243
Uh, right.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.877
My bad.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.015
At least Baby's grandparents
seem to be doing OK.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.382
Whoo!

32:30.382 --> 32:33.519
All right, party prawn
squids, and fish!

32:33.519 --> 32:37.156
They call me
Solid Gold Glamdaddy.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.825
And it's time to chomp 'n roll!

32:41.293 --> 32:45.764
Granola Granny Goddess
says public art for all!

32:45.764 --> 32:47.166
Welcome to--

32:47.166 --> 32:49.168
both: Burning Sand!

32:54.540 --> 32:57.609
I can't believe I missed
William's birthday party.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.379
I'm sorry, squiddo.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.315
I just feel so homesick,

33:03.315 --> 33:07.086
but I guess this is home now.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.954
both: Hm.

33:09.055 --> 33:12.291
I mean, the Mail Whale
here isn't even a whale!

33:12.291 --> 33:14.426
Got yer mail here.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.662
See?

33:16.662 --> 33:20.299
I just miss my old life.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.434
Baby.

33:22.434 --> 33:25.104
Should I recite a poem
about plankton to him?

33:25.104 --> 33:26.572
To cheer him up?

33:26.572 --> 33:28.840
Maybe later, pup.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.609
OK.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.782
You know, Baby.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.451
Having a best friend is like
being in any great pop duo--

33:39.451 --> 33:42.621
sometimes you sing together,
and sometimes you sing apart.

33:42.621 --> 33:43.955
Like your mom and me.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.924
But you two
hardly talk anymore.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.160
Does that even
count as fin-ship?

33:49.328 --> 33:50.796
Look.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.664
Just promise me you'll try.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.166
You'll love it here.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.135
There are more things
to do in Chomp City

33:56.135 --> 33:58.670
than there are grains
of sand in the ocean.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.406
Anything can happen.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.840
Who knows?

34:01.840 --> 34:03.475
Maybe you'll even make
a new best friend.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.744
A new best friend?

34:05.744 --> 34:10.549
Ha, Mommy says you're
funny, but that is rich.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.284
Baby?

34:12.284 --> 34:15.554
Swear on your star mark
you'll give Chomp City a shot?

34:15.554 --> 34:16.622
Boop!

34:17.889 --> 34:21.527
OK, swear on my star mark.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.229
Hm.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.936
Uh, what's going on, hon?

34:30.936 --> 34:32.571
If I'm going to get
my teeth cleaned by Dr.

34:32.571 --> 34:37.876
Sawtooth tomorrow, they need
to be abso-toothly sparkling!

34:39.645 --> 34:42.648
You think
she'll sign my retainer?

34:42.648 --> 34:43.915
At least one
of you fishies is

34:43.915 --> 34:45.551
adjusting well to city life.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.925
Ick!
Ugh!

34:53.925 --> 34:55.927
Nature! Why?

34:58.430 --> 34:59.465
My mouth!

34:59.465 --> 35:01.467
It went in my mouth!

35:01.467 --> 35:03.169
I told you to find
the Siren Stone,

35:03.169 --> 35:04.970
not take me backpacking!

35:04.970 --> 35:06.738
Ugh, the things I do for power.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.375
How did you track
it down, anyways?

35:09.375 --> 35:12.644
Oh, I just did some research,
befriended a quirky but kindly

35:12.644 --> 35:14.546
old monkfish, who gave
me a sacred scroll, used

35:14.546 --> 35:16.915
disappearing squid ink
to reveal the hidden symbols,

35:16.915 --> 35:19.050
and from there I
triangulated the coordinates.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.085
But the hardest--

35:20.186 --> 35:21.086
Shh!

35:21.187 --> 35:22.521
Look!

35:32.598 --> 35:35.100
The Siren Stone.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.819
It's beautiful!

35:53.819 --> 35:55.854
And it's mine.

35:57.456 --> 35:58.824
OK.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.427
It's really, uh--
really stuck in there.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.495
Rude!

36:03.495 --> 36:06.064
Ah!

36:06.064 --> 36:07.799
Ah!

36:10.602 --> 36:12.238
The Stone!

36:12.238 --> 36:16.141
With this power, Baby Shark's
star mark is as good as mine.

36:16.242 --> 36:19.678
And then, I will have
complete control!

37:34.420 --> 37:37.088
No.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.393
Hm.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.930
Time to give this whole
Chomp City thing a shot.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.067
Hmm.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.803
Hello.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.572

37:53.572 --> 37:55.607

38:16.127 --> 38:18.964
Oh, and a good day to you.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.143

38:33.779 --> 38:34.946
Same time tomorrow?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.115
You know it, Frank.

38:39.718 --> 38:41.387
What do you think?

38:41.387 --> 38:43.088
Sequin scales and chiffon?

38:43.088 --> 38:44.756

38:55.534 --> 38:57.903

William, squiddo?

38:57.903 --> 39:01.072
Yeah, but it's weird.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.809
I've never been nervous
to see him before.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.444
What if things are--

39:05.444 --> 39:08.847
I don't know,
different between us?

39:08.847 --> 39:12.050
Aw, I'm sure you
two will have a blast.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.920
You always do.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.032
Chomptacular, here I come!

39:27.032 --> 39:28.534
Have fun with Baby.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.302
Now you sure you know
the way to Chomp City?

39:31.437 --> 39:33.204
Mom, I'm a pilot fish.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.740
Directions are in my blood.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.443
Also, I just got this
cool app called Waterways!

39:37.443 --> 39:39.578
So there's no way I'm
going to get lost!

39:44.450 --> 39:46.251
This can't be right.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.857
Whoa!

39:57.095 --> 39:59.465
Wow.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.703
Chomp City!

40:04.703 --> 40:06.071

40:07.205 --> 40:09.140

40:15.581 --> 40:16.748
See, you back home,
I have this

40:16.748 --> 40:18.116
wry fast-talking
charm that usually

40:18.116 --> 40:19.417
gets me out of hot water--

40:19.417 --> 40:22.854
William?

40:22.854 --> 40:25.491
Baby!

40:28.359 --> 40:31.563
Oh, great,
you know each other.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.134
High fin for fin-ship!

40:36.134 --> 40:37.903
Wah!

40:42.140 --> 40:43.942
Why don't you ever stop?

40:43.942 --> 40:45.877
Can you believe I live here?

40:45.877 --> 40:47.178
Not really.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.980
I can't wait to
show you around.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.015
No way!

40:50.015 --> 40:52.150
A real life haberdashery!

40:52.150 --> 40:53.619
Ha-ha-ho!

40:53.619 --> 40:56.722
The fishes back home
are going to love this.

40:56.722 --> 40:59.958
Oh, so that's
a haberdashery.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.796
"Wavy haberdashery,"
am I right?

41:04.796 --> 41:05.964
Those words.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.432
So random!

41:07.533 --> 41:10.836
Yeah, it's hard to explain.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.914
Sharki B!

41:22.914 --> 41:25.751
Offshark and Sharki B,
chomping up the red carpet.

41:25.751 --> 41:29.020
We give a whole new
meaning to fishy fierce.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.456
Oh, hi-hi-hi-hi!

41:31.557 --> 41:33.091

lasts, fishies.

56:55.145 --> 56:57.081
Ah, don't be
hard on yourself.

56:57.081 --> 56:59.484
We all make mistakes.

56:59.484 --> 57:01.318
Oh, thank toothness.

57:01.318 --> 57:02.352
Hi, Sharki!

57:02.487 --> 57:03.588
Hi, Offshark!

57:03.588 --> 57:05.490
Aw, how you doing,
Kulture Sharki?

57:05.490 --> 57:09.527
Pretty jaw-some.

57:09.527 --> 57:12.763
And--
Who's this?

57:14.231 --> 57:17.201
Introducing the one and
only fin-credible Wavey Shark.

57:17.201 --> 57:18.803
Me!

57:18.803 --> 57:20.605
Our latest collab.

57:20.605 --> 57:23.574
A lot's happened since we
saw you back in Carnivore Cove.

57:23.574 --> 57:25.142
So what's going on?

57:25.142 --> 57:27.011
You got yourself
in a bind, huh?

57:27.011 --> 57:29.814
I really, really
need to meet ENHYPEN.

57:29.814 --> 57:32.016
Um, yeah, who doesn't?

57:32.016 --> 57:33.851
Do you know how I
might be able to get

57:33.851 --> 57:35.185
onto their tour sub?

57:35.185 --> 57:36.521
Well, those
belugas really love

57:36.521 --> 57:38.689
their after-song snackies.

57:38.689 --> 57:40.725
Maybe you could find
a way through the kitchen

57:40.725 --> 57:42.527
over there.

57:45.530 --> 57:48.833
Oh, thank you so, so much!

57:48.833 --> 57:49.834
Good luck!

57:49.834 --> 57:50.968
You got this!

57:50.968 --> 57:53.538
Bye-bye, Baby Shark.

57:57.742 --> 57:59.644
Is the gold dome too much?

57:59.644 --> 58:02.312
There's never too
much gold for Jungwon.

58:02.312 --> 58:05.616
This is ENHYPEN,
we need to wow!

58:05.616 --> 58:09.219
Funny, because I seem
to recall you oversalting

58:09.219 --> 58:10.454
the broth last time.

58:10.555 --> 58:12.322
We're in the ocean.

59:03.608 --> 59:05.175
Oh, right. Help.

59:05.175 --> 59:06.777
Yes! I need it.

59:06.777 --> 59:09.814

Stariana, right?

59:11.716 --> 59:15.285
Oh, my gills, you have
the voice of an angelfish.

59:15.285 --> 59:17.087
Well, turns out,
she's super evil.

59:17.087 --> 59:19.489
She wants to rule
the whole wide water.

59:19.624 --> 59:21.726
Your dance moves
are breathtaking.

59:21.726 --> 59:23.527
And she fish-napped
my very best friend

59:23.628 --> 59:25.329
to get me to help her do it!

59:25.329 --> 59:26.964
I respect you deeply.

59:26.964 --> 59:30.067
Also, she's using something
called the Siren Stone?

59:30.067 --> 59:32.436
I think that's what's making
everyfishy obsessed with her!

59:32.436 --> 59:35.906
They've got these dead eyes,
and they're all smiley, so--

59:35.906 --> 59:38.643
um, yeah!

59:42.847 --> 59:45.850
I sound ridiculous, don't I?

59:45.850 --> 59:48.452
He has a star mark.

59:48.452 --> 59:50.955
Oh. Yeah.

59:50.955 --> 59:52.890
It's kind of my trademark.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.358
You know what we have to do?

59:54.358 --> 59:56.393
Gear up, everyfishy.

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:04.902
Whoa.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.971
We're not just a boy band.

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:09.573
We're an elite team
of musical operatives

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:14.078
sworn to protect the harmony
of the underwater universe.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.653
Wha--

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.822
Shocking but true.

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.657
You're right about
the Siren Stone.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.727
It's a powerful piece
of ancient musical magic.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.962
We noticed it was missing.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.197
No.

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:35.599
But we couldn't
track its location.

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:38.969
If Stariana performs at the
Chomptacular using the power

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.839
of the Siren Stone,
she'll steal the song

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:44.274
from everyfishy's soul.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:50.247
Once that happens, nofishy
will be able to sing any song

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:51.481
but hers.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.183
But why is she after me?

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:54.518
Because of this.

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.253
My star mark?

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:59.356
Legend has it that the
catchiest fish in the sea

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.925
is marked by a star.

01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:03.961
If Stariana steals
your song and your star mark,

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:05.362
she'll be unstoppable.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.998
Yeah, that's why she
fish-napped your friend.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:12.202
So this is all because of me?

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:13.771
Poor William!

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:18.342
I wish-- I wish he and I were
never friends to begin with.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.745
Then we wouldn't have
gotten into a fight.

01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:23.280
And he wouldn't
be in trouble now!

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:26.483
C'mon, Baby.

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:27.818
Don't say that.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.920
Sometimes, we hurt
our friends' feelings.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.190
We drift apart, and
come back together.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.959
It may not always
look perfect,

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.994
but when you care
for some-fish else,

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.763
nothing can take that away.

01:01:38.763 --> 01:01:39.864
Yeah.

01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:41.531
Fin-ship conquers all.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:45.335
And the fin-ship between you
and William can conquer this.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:47.337
Do you really think so?

01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:53.077
Fin-ship is the only thing
more powerful than music.

01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:58.415
So you're ready to gear up?

01:01:58.415 --> 01:01:59.516
Am I?

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.488
Can we have a tie, too?

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:09.059
You bet.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:12.162
