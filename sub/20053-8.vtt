WEBVTT

00:02.099 --> 00:04.301
You always said you'd
never leave Kansas City

00:04.335 --> 00:06.138
unless it was for something really big.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.439
Well, I just got an offer
from New York, darlin'.

00:08.472 --> 00:09.320
The Yankees?

00:09.328 --> 00:10.074
The Mets.

00:10.162 --> 00:11.019
Ohh.

00:11.122 --> 00:13.223
Yeah, I know, but I'd still
be the voice of New York.

00:13.257 --> 00:15.226
And you and I would finally
be the king and queen

00:15.258 --> 00:17.027
of a great city... of the city.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.029
Well, Kansas City's a great city.

00:19.063 --> 00:20.398
Yeah, for ribs, and that's it.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.633
And Memphis is better.

00:21.665 --> 00:23.968
Jim, we have neighbors.

00:24.002 --> 00:25.737
Watch your mouth.

00:25.770 --> 00:28.106
We've built a life for ourselves here.

00:28.139 --> 00:30.375
It's also small-time, is what it is.

00:30.407 --> 00:32.176
I'm... I'm a peacock, darlin'.

00:32.209 --> 00:35.179
I need to strut my stuff
out there on the world stage.

00:35.212 --> 00:38.249
I love you, Jim.

00:38.282 --> 00:40.517
And I want you to be happy.

00:42.319 --> 00:43.454
So...

00:45.250 --> 00:46.523
let's do it.

00:46.557 --> 00:48.193
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:48.225 --> 00:49.493
- New York?
- Yeah.

00:49.526 --> 00:51.395
Honey, I love you. I love you.

00:51.429 --> 00:52.731
Mwah.

00:52.764 --> 00:55.032
You know, the first
time you said that to me

00:55.066 --> 00:56.632
was 20 years ago today.

00:57.298 --> 00:58.447
Is today the 9th?

00:58.513 --> 00:59.187
Mm-hmm.

00:59.211 --> 01:00.538
Oh, how could I have forgotten that?

01:00.570 --> 01:02.172
- I'm sorry.
- Aww.

01:02.206 --> 01:03.475
You can make it up to me later.

01:03.507 --> 01:04.542
Oh-kay!

01:04.575 --> 01:05.576
All right.

01:05.609 --> 01:08.078
I might need a little
nap first, but yeah, yeah.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.279
Oh!

01:09.313 --> 01:11.549
- Love you, honey.
- I love you, too!

01:12.582 --> 01:14.051
Supper will be on the stove!

01:14.085 --> 01:15.153
Thank you.

01:32.436 --> 01:35.272
You shut your mouth, you little bitch.

01:35.305 --> 01:36.640
Yes, Mistress L.

01:36.674 --> 01:38.543
Now, I want you to grab some nitrous,

01:38.576 --> 01:42.580
and you get your tiny dick to my house.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.805
How is it still on fire after a week?!

02:07.838 --> 02:10.175
It's like we're in hell!

02:10.207 --> 02:12.342
I feel that hell would
be more impressive.

02:12.376 --> 02:14.445
These FEMA assholes won't let us play

02:14.479 --> 02:17.215
just 'cause the ground
temperature is 157.

02:17.239 --> 02:18.397
They wear cleats, you know!

02:19.249 --> 02:20.752
I'm gonna take this.

02:20.784 --> 02:23.388
Okay.

02:23.420 --> 02:24.588
Joe Buck.

02:24.622 --> 02:27.258
Are we "randomly call each other
during the day" friends now?

02:27.290 --> 02:29.127
Mm, no, not quite.

02:29.159 --> 02:30.761
I've got you listed as

02:30.794 --> 02:33.764
Golden-Voiced Homeless
Man number 2 in my phone.

02:33.798 --> 02:36.102
Look, the way I see it,

02:36.166 --> 02:39.103
Musburger's turd means
I owe you a favor now.

02:39.136 --> 02:41.806
I've been making some calls, and I may

02:41.838 --> 02:44.141
have gotten you a job in baseball.

02:44.175 --> 02:46.544
Oh, Joe, I would kill up to five people

02:46.576 --> 02:48.680
for you if you could get
me the hell outta here.

02:48.712 --> 02:52.116
Atlanta's thinking about
making a change at play-by-play,

02:52.150 --> 02:54.152
but you make them nervous.

02:54.185 --> 02:57.421
So, here's the deal.
You got to go down...

02:58.855 --> 03:01.425
You got to go down to their
AAA club in New Orleans

03:01.459 --> 03:02.727
and work for a while.

03:02.759 --> 03:03.760
Oh, my God, that's incredible.

03:03.794 --> 03:04.796
And tell 'em not to be nervous.

03:04.829 --> 03:06.531
Tell 'em I don't drink...

03:06.563 --> 03:09.115
hard liquor between the
hours of 6:00 and 11:00 a.m.

03:09.234 --> 03:10.155
What about drugs?

03:10.187 --> 03:11.502
Oh, no, the cocaine, that's just...

03:11.536 --> 03:13.872
it's like little confidence
cups of coffee during the day,

03:13.904 --> 03:15.240
little bumps. That's all.

03:15.272 --> 03:16.508
Buddy, listen.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.376
If you can make it no booze

03:18.408 --> 03:20.711
between 6:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,

03:20.745 --> 03:22.447
and coke only on the weekends,

03:22.479 --> 03:24.381
I think I can hook this up for you.

03:24.414 --> 03:25.917
All right, there, mommy.

03:25.949 --> 03:28.985
Okay, but either way, this
calls for a celebration.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.318
The only catch is you
have to start immediately.

03:31.350 --> 03:32.189
Ahh.

03:32.223 --> 03:33.661
What was that?

03:33.717 --> 03:34.659
What was that?

03:34.692 --> 03:37.185
- Who do you think you are?!
- Oh, oh, I gotta go.

03:37.256 --> 03:38.145
Thank you, Joe Buck.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.198
Let me know.

03:46.336 --> 03:48.338
This is crap.

03:48.372 --> 03:49.674
Who do you think you are?!

03:49.706 --> 03:51.675
You think you're such a
big shot, Mr. FEMA guy!

03:51.709 --> 03:53.444
- All right. Okay.
- You know who you are?

03:53.477 --> 03:55.513
You're just the orderly that's summoned

03:55.545 --> 03:56.813
when America shits itself!

03:56.847 --> 03:59.183
All right, easy there.
Hey, Jake LaMotta, easy.

03:59.217 --> 04:00.585
Hey, let him go.

04:00.617 --> 04:04.455
Come on, Jules. My
goodness, it's not his fault.

04:05.890 --> 04:07.258
I know.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.193
It's Pennsylvania Shale's.

04:14.814 --> 04:17.416
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

04:17.750 --> 04:18.636
I'm playing solitaire.

04:18.956 --> 04:21.093
Yeah, I got addicted to the
solitaire on my office computer,

04:21.125 --> 04:22.161
so I come in here...

04:22.194 --> 04:23.828
You set fire to my field?!

04:23.862 --> 04:25.564
I heard about the natural phenomenon

04:25.597 --> 04:27.500
occurring at the
stadium. That is a shame.

04:27.533 --> 04:28.867
I just want to assure you that we...

04:28.900 --> 04:30.502
Just be real for one God damn second

04:30.535 --> 04:32.004
and admit that you set fire to my field

04:32.037 --> 04:33.939
because you want my team to go under

04:33.972 --> 04:35.241
for some bullshit reason!

04:35.273 --> 04:38.744
I would never, ever
do anything like that.

04:38.776 --> 04:41.613
And even if I did, I
would never admit to it

04:41.646 --> 04:43.582
'cause I'm assuming you're recording me.

04:44.749 --> 04:45.750
What?

04:45.783 --> 04:48.286
Come on. Slide it over.

04:48.319 --> 04:50.021
Okay.

04:51.857 --> 04:53.292
Fine.

04:55.326 --> 04:57.161
Spy pen, please.

04:57.194 --> 05:00.499
The one just pokin' on out of the bag.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.868
That's good.

05:03.901 --> 05:06.938
All right.

05:06.972 --> 05:08.239
Wow, are you kidding me?

05:08.273 --> 05:10.242
You have a record
player in your boardroom?

05:10.275 --> 05:12.044
Shh, shh, shh.

05:12.076 --> 05:13.612
It just sounds warmer.

05:13.645 --> 05:15.014
My God, you're so sick.

05:15.047 --> 05:17.182
Look, this is nothing personal, Jules.

05:17.215 --> 05:19.751
I genuinely like you.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.554
You are very, very good-looking,

05:22.588 --> 05:24.790
but the forces you're
facing are bigger than me.

05:24.823 --> 05:26.792
They're bigger than Pennsylvania Shale.

05:26.824 --> 05:30.261
Someday, when everything
switches over to solar panels

05:30.295 --> 05:33.932
in a hundred years, or,
you know, God willing, 200,

05:33.965 --> 05:36.835
a guy like me is gonna be having
the exact same conversation

05:36.867 --> 05:39.338
with someone who owns the
best place to catch the sun.

05:39.371 --> 05:41.674
Or maybe it'd even
sound different, like...

05:41.706 --> 05:43.841
like that future
language in "Cloud Atlas."

05:43.874 --> 05:45.209
Oh, my God, I... Have you seen?

05:45.242 --> 05:49.348
That movie is wild.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.350
What were we talking
about right before that?

05:52.384 --> 05:53.985
All right, asshole.

05:54.018 --> 05:56.088
I thought that my revenge
was gonna be satisfying,

05:56.121 --> 05:58.991
but I guess I'll just
have to settle

05:59.023 --> 06:00.191
for petty.

06:00.225 --> 06:02.294
What... what do we got here?

06:02.326 --> 06:06.098
It's something from a
naturally occurring puddle

06:06.131 --> 06:07.333
inside the visitor bullpen.

06:07.365 --> 06:09.100
No, no. Don't, please, don't!

06:09.134 --> 06:10.669
- Ha!
- Not the vinyl!

06:10.701 --> 06:13.204
Oh, my God, the smell!

06:13.237 --> 06:16.307
Aah! Aah! Aah!

06:18.076 --> 06:22.147
Aaaaaaah!

06:22.179 --> 06:25.783
It burns! It's burning my eyes!

06:25.816 --> 06:28.954
Make it stop. It burns!

06:38.896 --> 06:41.666
What'd you decide, Jim?

06:41.699 --> 06:43.201
I'm torn, Joe Buck.

06:43.235 --> 06:46.852
I want the job, of course,
but the problem is Jules.

06:46.963 --> 06:49.367
I love her, and I'm terrified of her.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.068
Probably in equal measure.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.269
Look, I think I've given
you the wrong impression.

06:53.302 --> 06:55.206
Uh, I just wanted to do you a solid.

06:55.239 --> 06:58.943
I didn't volunteer to be the
guy you come to for life advice.

06:58.975 --> 07:00.810
You ever mad eye contact with someone

07:00.843 --> 07:01.978
while they stuck a finger

07:02.011 --> 07:03.648
farther and farther up your butt?

07:03.680 --> 07:05.815
And you don't know how
much more you can handle,

07:05.848 --> 07:06.983
but they do?

07:07.016 --> 07:08.752
I'm in the bathroom right now.

07:08.785 --> 07:10.220
Ah, just answer the question, Joe.

07:10.254 --> 07:11.884
I was born in Florida.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.677
Of course I've had a finger in my ass.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.421
Then you know what it's
like to be in love, Joe Buck.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.162
I'm hanging up now.

07:18.194 --> 07:19.262
Hey...

07:20.864 --> 07:23.224
Fucking Brockmire.

07:23.256 --> 07:26.671
Hey! I have great news.

07:26.704 --> 07:29.706
Don't tell me those bastards
agreed to accept responsibility.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.074
No, they kicked me off their property

07:31.107 --> 07:32.231
and file a restraining order against me.

07:32.295 --> 07:33.342
But then FEMA called and said

07:33.378 --> 07:35.366
that the last fire finally
went out on the field.

07:35.845 --> 07:39.370
So we can re-sod the grass
and play our last game.

07:39.402 --> 07:40.985
Are you ready?

07:41.018 --> 07:43.220
I mean, I got nowhere else to be.

07:45.221 --> 07:47.323
So, we have to do
what to pay off your loan?

07:47.357 --> 07:49.827
I have to sell a week's worth
of concessions is one game,

07:49.860 --> 07:51.577
and we have to win to stay above .500.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.964
Forgive my negativity,

07:52.997 --> 07:54.831
but you're not gonna
sell that much in one day.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.735
Nobody's gonna eat 15 hot dogs.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.842
They might drink 15 beers.

08:04.874 --> 08:06.377
You know, we never did better business

08:06.410 --> 08:08.145
than when we forfeited the Butler game

08:08.177 --> 08:09.814
and everybody just stayed and drank.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.448
All right, so we get the entire stadium

08:11.482 --> 08:13.217
to get as drunk as humanly possible.

08:13.249 --> 08:14.384
I love that plan.

you doing a live podcast

on your Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook.

08:34.904 --> 08:36.905
Maybe we could also

08:36.940 --> 08:40.344
Maybe one of those, uh, PayPal
donate buttons generate some,

08:40.376 --> 08:43.113

Some crowdsource money, huh?

08:43.147 --> 08:46.850
Yeah. That's a... a great idea.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.456
♪ Let's play a baseball game ♪

08:53.490 --> 08:55.931
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to Morristown Stadium.

08:55.954 --> 08:57.827
We have got a heck of a ballgame

08:57.860 --> 08:59.330
planned for you here this afternoon.

08:59.363 --> 09:02.099
Now, in order to keep
the Frackers right here

09:02.132 --> 09:03.971
in Morristown where they belong,

09:03.984 --> 09:05.312
we have decided to hold

09:05.355 --> 09:07.090
a stadium-wide drinkin' contest.

09:07.282 --> 09:10.891
That's right, a stadium-wide
drinkin' contest.

09:11.108 --> 09:13.110
The rules of this game are simple.

09:13.143 --> 09:15.278
After every inning, drink a beer.

09:15.312 --> 09:17.815
After every run scored, drink a beer.

09:17.847 --> 09:20.350
Heck, after ever
strikeout, drink a beer.

09:20.384 --> 09:23.307
Oh, if the guy sittin'
next to you drinks a beer,

09:23.363 --> 09:24.759
you got to drink a beer.

09:24.823 --> 09:28.292
And drink a beer every time
you hear me say the magic words,

09:28.325 --> 09:30.613
"Hey, everybody, drink a beer!"

09:30.676 --> 09:34.398
So, good luck to us and
good luck to our Frackers.

09:35.865 --> 09:38.101
Are you gonna die?

09:38.134 --> 09:39.253
Probably not.

09:39.301 --> 09:42.172
But, hey, if somethin'
should happen, Charles,

09:42.206 --> 09:44.508
I just... I want to thank
you for all your assistance

09:44.541 --> 09:46.210
and your companionship. You just...

09:46.243 --> 09:48.445
believe it or not,
you're the best friend

09:48.477 --> 09:49.880
I have on this earth.

09:51.148 --> 09:53.384
That seemed to terrify you. Why is that?

09:53.417 --> 09:55.219
Well, it's 'cause...

09:55.251 --> 09:58.088
I could say the same thing about you.

09:59.452 --> 10:02.091
I really need to get my shit together.

10:02.124 --> 10:03.961
Oh, welcome to the
club, my young friend.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.396
Welcome to the club. I'll drink to that.

10:05.428 --> 10:07.096
To gettin' shit together.

10:07.129 --> 10:10.868
22 beers for the price of 21, guys.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.969
Hi again. Whoo-hoo!

10:13.003 --> 10:15.406
Yep, okay. Good on you.

10:15.438 --> 10:17.473
More beer... we need more beer!

10:17.507 --> 10:21.312
Yoshi workin' on an 0-2
count to the leadoff batter.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.352
Oh, I haven't seen gas
like that from Yoshi

10:28.384 --> 10:30.420
since he played for the Yankees.

10:30.453 --> 10:32.989
That is the first strikeout
of the game, folks,

10:33.023 --> 10:36.125
and that means that we
are drinkin' a beer!

10:36.158 --> 10:38.995
Everybody drink a beer.

10:39.028 --> 10:40.865
Cheers!

10:46.981 --> 10:47.997
You know what?

10:48.068 --> 10:49.639
Folks, everybody burp with me.

10:49.672 --> 10:51.008
Everybody, one, two, three...

10:52.676 --> 10:54.378
I don't care if they puke.

10:54.411 --> 10:55.479
Just keep selling beer!

10:55.512 --> 10:57.648
Whoo! Move it!

10:57.681 --> 10:59.148
Next.

10:59.182 --> 11:00.217
That do?

11:01.652 --> 11:03.052
Here is your change.

11:03.086 --> 11:04.922
Ah-haha!

11:04.955 --> 11:07.391
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

11:07.423 --> 11:11.227
Move y'all big ass! Ha ha ha!

11:11.260 --> 11:13.329
Little pop-up to
the third-base side.

11:13.363 --> 11:16.367
Uribe giving chase. Does he have room?

11:16.399 --> 11:18.134
He does!

11:18.167 --> 11:20.004
That'll end the third,

11:20.037 --> 11:23.908
and that means that we are
drinkin' a beer, Morristown!

11:23.941 --> 11:26.410
Everybody drink a beer!

11:26.442 --> 11:28.678
Ha! Salute.

11:31.414 --> 11:35.018
No sipping, everybody.
Chugging only. Come on.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.326
Yeah, Pedro!

11:43.626 --> 11:46.296
All right,
bot... bottom of the fifth.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.198
Oh, here he comes.

11:48.230 --> 11:51.828
Folks, if you are feeling the
breeze out there in left field,

11:51.868 --> 11:52.970
that is coming from
the bat of John Elton,

11:53.003 --> 11:55.406
who has struck out
swingin' three times today.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.173
Hey! Shut up!

11:57.206 --> 11:58.708
Hey, you shut up.

11:58.741 --> 12:02.413
Just... just concentrate
on the ball for once.

12:04.547 --> 12:09.119
Oh! Somebody just set
that vacuum on blow!

12:09.152 --> 12:11.622
Home run for John Elton!

12:11.654 --> 12:14.223
That just made the score 1-0.

12:14.257 --> 12:15.292
My goodness!

12:15.325 --> 12:18.494
That means that we are drinkin' a beer!

12:18.528 --> 12:21.966
Drink a beer, everybody.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.667
Mmm!

12:23.700 --> 12:28.154
That is the unlikeliest
beer I have ever drunk.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.111
Home run for John Elton.

12:30.186 --> 12:32.408
Oh! Well, that's for you, too, son.

12:32.442 --> 12:35.078
That's for you. Congratulations.

12:35.111 --> 12:36.179
Mm!

12:41.717 --> 12:45.545
All right, now, it's time for
the seventh-inning stretch.

12:45.656 --> 12:47.784
Or you... you can just stay sitting

12:47.790 --> 12:49.465
if standing is too hard for you.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.694
Whoo!

12:50.726 --> 12:54.430
Anyway, mm, mm, mm.

12:54.464 --> 12:56.433
Ohh.

12:56.466 --> 12:59.036
Mwah!

12:59.068 --> 13:01.571
Hey, everybody. Hey, Morristown.

13:01.605 --> 13:04.541
Why do men do that at the urinal?

13:04.573 --> 13:08.077
Why do they lean their
head on the... on the wall?

13:08.110 --> 13:10.179
What's up with that?

13:10.212 --> 13:12.682
- Anyway...
- Keep 'em comin'!

13:12.716 --> 13:16.653
Guys, not throwing it, please.

13:16.686 --> 13:19.590
Oh, this microphone
feels cool on my head.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.663
Everybody...

13:26.696 --> 13:30.367
Ooh, hoo, everybody's feelin' it now.

13:30.399 --> 13:32.403
I know that I am.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.071
Whoa.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.639
M-Morristown, um...

13:36.672 --> 13:38.241
Jim, we did it!

13:38.274 --> 13:39.709
We did it!

13:39.743 --> 13:41.278
We made more than enough
to pay off the loan.

13:41.311 --> 13:43.480
- You can stop drinking.
- Oh, that's so good.

13:43.513 --> 13:45.416
That's so good!

13:45.448 --> 13:47.183
Oh, my God!

13:47.216 --> 13:49.086
What are you doing? Stop!

13:49.119 --> 13:52.321
I'm celebratin'. Come
on, you got to celebrate.

13:52.355 --> 13:53.757
We'll still have to win the game.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.092
Uh, wha...

13:56.125 --> 13:59.629
We're not winnin'? Come
on. What's the score?

13:59.663 --> 14:01.498
Pfft!

14:01.531 --> 14:04.101
I'm drunk.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.768
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.104
God damn it, I'm drunk.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.106
Jim, we're up by a run,

14:09.139 --> 14:10.841
but the bases are loaded with no outs

14:10.874 --> 14:12.308
in the top of the ninth.

14:12.341 --> 14:15.142
- Oh, that is not good.
- No.

14:15.269 --> 14:16.499
- So I am drinking a beer.
- Don't...

14:16.682 --> 14:18.648
- No, no, no, stop, stop.
- Stop, please.

14:18.682 --> 14:22.619
Jules, when'd you get here?

14:22.652 --> 14:25.254
Hey, how we doin'... doin' on money?

14:25.288 --> 14:26.789
Oh, dear God.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.458
I gotta pee. Oh, my...

14:28.491 --> 14:29.526
Ah, pfft!

14:36.006 --> 14:37.041
Come on.

14:37.074 --> 14:38.342
Ah!

14:38.374 --> 14:40.309
Oh, shit.

14:40.343 --> 14:42.713
He finally snapped.

14:46.717 --> 14:48.352
Time-out.

14:48.385 --> 14:49.787
Time, time, time.

14:49.819 --> 14:51.121
Announcer's time.

14:51.153 --> 14:52.388
Bring it in.

14:52.421 --> 14:54.123
Frackers.

14:54.156 --> 14:55.858
Come on, bring it in, move it!

14:55.892 --> 14:58.395
Whoo. All right.

14:58.427 --> 15:00.129
How you doin', Yoshi?

15:00.162 --> 15:02.198
All right, good. Yo, hustle it up.

15:02.232 --> 15:04.401
Good hustle, good hustle.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.203
Ohh.

15:06.236 --> 15:10.174
You guys are great. You, I love. Mwah!

15:10.207 --> 15:12.109
Mwah!

15:12.142 --> 15:13.710
Oh! You sweaty.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.216
Why is Brockmire sobbing,
telling us that he loves us?

15:19.248 --> 15:20.718
Because I do love you!

15:20.751 --> 15:22.486
Because you guys, you play the game...

15:22.518 --> 15:23.920
Wait.

15:23.954 --> 15:25.723
... that you all fell
in love with as kids.

15:25.756 --> 15:28.192
And that's... it's beautiful.

15:28.224 --> 15:29.959
That's beautiful.

15:29.992 --> 15:31.194
It's beautiful, right?

15:31.228 --> 15:33.363
Yeah, we'll just all gently agree

15:33.396 --> 15:35.031
with whatever he says, okay?

15:35.065 --> 15:38.301
Hey, look. It's your pal, Charles.

15:38.334 --> 15:39.836
- Charles.
- Charles.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.971
- What are you...
- Go get him.

15:42.005 --> 15:44.108
Life is hard for you
'cause you're black.

15:44.141 --> 15:45.476
- Oh.
- And that's... that's insane.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.243
- It's crazy, man.
- Come on.

15:47.276 --> 15:48.444
It's wrong. Let's go.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.113
What year is it?

15:50.146 --> 15:52.516
It's... it's... it's the
current year that... that it is?

15:52.549 --> 15:54.050
- Absolutely.
- That's not right.

15:54.084 --> 15:55.285
That's right, come on.

15:55.318 --> 15:56.386
Wait, I forgot to tell them one thing.

15:56.419 --> 15:57.454
- No, no, it's fine.
- No.

15:57.487 --> 15:58.454
They'll be fine. They'll be fine.

15:58.488 --> 15:59.622
- They'll be fine without it.
- All right, easy.

15:59.656 --> 16:02.291
Yoshi's running on fumes,
so somebody has to step up.

16:02.324 --> 16:04.127
Come on, guys, I signed you all

16:04.161 --> 16:06.130
'cause I saw that you all had something.

16:06.162 --> 16:07.897
Or had something left.

16:07.930 --> 16:10.166
Danny, I watched you turn
a gorgeous double play

16:10.199 --> 16:11.868
at a juco in upstate New York.

16:11.901 --> 16:13.970
Uribe, a scout sent me
a link to your highlights

16:14.003 --> 16:14.805
in the Venezuelan league.

16:14.838 --> 16:16.473
I tracked you down that night.

16:16.506 --> 16:20.144
And, John Elton... John Elton.

16:20.176 --> 16:22.812
Honestly, that was a mistake.

16:22.845 --> 16:25.448
I asked an agent for Juan
Eltun, and he misheard me.

16:25.482 --> 16:26.517
But...

16:26.550 --> 16:28.819
Actually explains a lot.

16:28.852 --> 16:30.454
But you just hit the go-ahead home run.

16:30.487 --> 16:31.921
- Yeah.
- Yeah. -Yeah.

16:31.954 --> 16:33.389
If he can do that,

16:33.422 --> 16:35.792
just imagine what the
rest of you are capable of.

16:35.825 --> 16:37.026
- Yes!
- All right.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.829
I know this wasn't
your dream to be here,

16:39.863 --> 16:41.031
but it is mine.

16:41.064 --> 16:43.433
So please, someone get out
there and make a God damn play!

16:44.935 --> 16:47.170
- Let's go!
- Uno, dos, tres...

16:47.204 --> 16:49.573
Frackers!

16:49.606 --> 16:51.308
For you, Miss Jules! For you!

16:51.340 --> 16:53.409
Where'd you get that?

16:53.443 --> 16:54.912
I don't know.

16:54.944 --> 16:56.914
I just looked down, and there it was.

16:56.946 --> 16:59.515
Tell you what... I feel naked,

16:59.549 --> 17:02.520
uh, watching the game without
a microphone in my hand.

17:04.621 --> 17:05.823
How's this?

17:05.855 --> 17:07.123
Where'd you get that?

17:07.156 --> 17:08.425
I don't know.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.559
I just looked down, and it was there.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.528
- You're a prodigy. God damn you, prodigy.
- Thank you.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.298
All right, hey.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.433
Drunken idiots of Morristown...

17:16.465 --> 17:17.867
Yeah, hello.

17:17.901 --> 17:20.137
Turn your attention to the field.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.205
You will see the greatest victory

17:22.238 --> 17:24.507
in the history of Morristown right now.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.276
Come on, Frackers!

17:29.179 --> 17:31.247
From your lips to
Willie Stargell's ears.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.916
Come on now, Frackers!
Come on, cheer 'em.

17:33.949 --> 17:35.885
- Go, let's go!
- Oh, Yoshi.

17:35.919 --> 17:37.120
You got this, mang.

17:37.152 --> 17:38.555
Joo got this.

17:38.587 --> 17:41.424
Go, Yoshi.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.026
Come on, Yoshi!

18:04.314 --> 18:06.316
Oh, nice grab by Uribe.

18:07.277 --> 18:08.345
Round the horn.

18:20.363 --> 18:21.465
Out!

18:26.068 --> 18:28.938
Triple play! Triple play!

18:28.971 --> 18:31.307
Whoo!

18:32.374 --> 18:34.944
Yeah!

18:34.978 --> 18:37.346
We did it!

18:37.380 --> 18:38.681
I never seen it!

18:38.715 --> 18:41.184
I never seen a triple
play to win a game!

18:41.217 --> 18:44.153
Baseball lives in Morristown!

19:03.006 --> 19:04.641
Whoo!

19:04.673 --> 19:06.542
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:06.575 --> 19:08.377
Yeah, baby!

19:16.052 --> 19:18.455
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:19.522 --> 19:21.058
Oh, my God! Yeah!

19:33.769 --> 19:36.105
Well, good morning, sunshine.

19:36.139 --> 19:38.308
Hey.

19:40.826 --> 19:42.521
Uh...

19:44.459 --> 19:45.861
I'm sorry.

19:49.084 --> 19:52.355
Atlanta wants to audition
me to be their new announcer.

19:52.389 --> 19:55.693
They want me to finish off
the season at AAA New Orleans.

19:58.128 --> 19:59.295
Look, you know

19:59.328 --> 20:00.663
that if I have a path to The Show,

20:00.697 --> 20:03.534
I just... I have to take it.

20:04.093 --> 20:05.795
I know.

20:05.827 --> 20:09.164
Jules, come with me.

20:11.507 --> 20:13.744
You know I can't.

20:15.511 --> 20:18.315
I'm not going to abandon my team.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.382
Why not?

20:19.415 --> 20:21.350
God, you have this fantasy
that if you save the team,

20:21.383 --> 20:22.518
you're gonna save the town.

20:22.552 --> 20:25.355
But you're plugging a dam
with a dozen other leaks in it.

20:25.388 --> 20:28.125
How do you think this place
got to be the way it is?

20:28.158 --> 20:30.995
Anytime anybody made
anything, then they just left.

20:32.461 --> 20:34.096
If you really wanted me to come,

20:34.130 --> 20:35.732
you wouldn't have packed
your bags before you asked.

20:35.765 --> 20:38.468
Oh, screw the... hey.
Screw the bags, okay?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.603
- I want you with me. I love you.
- No!

20:40.636 --> 20:43.039
You don't get to say that while
you're walking out the door.

20:43.073 --> 20:46.509
Ah, see? This is why I did
not want to get involved, okay?

20:46.543 --> 20:48.210
- I didn't want get...
- Trapped?

20:48.244 --> 20:49.613
I wasn't gonna say "trapped," all right?

20:49.645 --> 20:51.313
I was gonna use a different
word than "trapped."

20:51.346 --> 20:53.517
A-a nicer word.

20:53.549 --> 20:55.084
Uh, enmeshed.

21:00.757 --> 21:02.324
I've never trapped a man in my life.

21:02.357 --> 21:03.626
You want to leave? Leave.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.171
Wha...

21:05.235 --> 21:07.363
I don't wanna leave. I
have to leave, Jules.

21:07.397 --> 21:08.068
I...

21:08.179 --> 21:10.334
Yeah, I know, sure.

21:15.138 --> 21:17.174
Take care of yourself.

21:22.679 --> 21:23.680
Wait.

21:27.549 --> 21:28.651
About a year from now,

21:28.684 --> 21:30.853
you're gonna realize the
colossal mistake you just made.

21:30.886 --> 21:32.521
You're gonna come crawling back.

21:32.555 --> 21:34.123
You're gonna want to fix it.

21:34.157 --> 21:36.660
You're gonna try to sweet-talk me.

21:36.692 --> 21:40.463
Let me save you the time
and tell you right now.

21:40.497 --> 21:42.690
Go fuck yourself.

21:42.754 --> 21:46.190
You're dead to me.

21:46.669 --> 21:48.205
Now you can go.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.105
Can I just... can I grab my bag?

21:56.111 --> 21:57.113
Leave!

22:00.150 --> 22:02.352
- Please?
- Now!

22:19.536 --> 22:21.371
Where's your luggage?

22:26.034 --> 22:28.344
I am going to get drunk and pass out.

22:31.547 --> 22:33.583
Wake me when we get to Louisiana.

22:33.615 --> 22:36.452
Sure thing.

22:45.495 --> 22:48.465
So, this, uh... this apartment
you're getting in New Orleans,

22:48.497 --> 22:49.900
I'm assuming it's a two-bedroom

22:49.932 --> 22:52.401
'cause I don't know if I
can handle a Bert and Ernie,

22:52.434 --> 22:54.303
twin-bed situation.

22:54.336 --> 22:57.406
I actually understood that reference.
