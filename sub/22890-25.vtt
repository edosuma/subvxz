- Ah, you smell good.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.200
- Anyways...

09:16.200 --> 09:17.433
- And just let me know when
you guys are ready, okay?

09:17.467 --> 09:18.467
- Cool.
- I'm going to get

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
a Bud Light.
- Whoa.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.333
- I'll do a Blue Moon.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.066
- Yeah.
- If you guys are having beer,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.600
I'll have a beer, sh--.
What's going on, man?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.266
It's good to see you.
- It's been a minute.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.033
- I'm good man,
just, just, uh...

09:30.066 --> 09:32.333
Working on my music, and--
- Yeah.

09:32.367 --> 09:35.000
- I moved back home,
which is always like, it's--

09:35.033 --> 09:37.000
- Dude, hey,
keep that overhead low

09:37.033 --> 09:38.433
while you're
pursuing the dream.

09:38.467 --> 09:41.233
- It's an adjustment for sure.

09:41.266 --> 09:43.066
- Well, you can't
bring a girl back there.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.600
both: Uh...

09:44.633 --> 09:46.633
- No, you can, no, you can.
Sh--, my bad.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.767
- Maybe.
So I've just been like,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.300
just chasing the dream
right now, you know?

09:50.333 --> 09:52.200
- Yeah, man.
- By the way,

09:52.233 --> 09:56.200
Scheana doesn't know that,
like, we're, you know,

09:56.233 --> 09:57.567
here right now, I didn't...

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
- She doesn't need to know.
- Exactly.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.333
Hey, Scheana, I understand
that you and Shay are divorced,

10:02.367 --> 10:04.500
but that doesn't mean I can't
still be friends with him.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
- Cheers.
- Cheers, man.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.166
- I mean, sh--,
you were friends with Kristen.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.567
Ridiculous.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.734
- For me, I've gotten
to the point where

10:13.767 --> 10:15.300
I'm really, like, happy
where I'm at.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.734
- Yeah.
- I'm there, like, I'm just--

10:16.767 --> 10:19.367
It's crazy you forget
what being happy is

10:19.400 --> 10:21.033
when you're happy.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.533
- Oh, sh--, man,
I thought I was happy

10:22.533 --> 10:24.667
this whole time, but I wasn't.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.200
- You know you're married

10:26.233 --> 10:28.100
when you know
how to do throw pillows.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.633
- They just sit there all day,
and then you take them off.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.467
Then you have to
put them back on.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.133
- I don't like
having a drunk husband

10:34.166 --> 10:36.266
who can't take care of me.
- Obviously, I'm unhappy

10:36.266 --> 10:37.533
because I'm a loser,
I don't have a job.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.000
- I've never said
you're a loser.

10:39.033 --> 10:40.400
- But that's
how it's coming off.

10:40.433 --> 10:43.533
- I want to fix this.
I want to fix you.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.667
- I feel like you lost
your identity a little bit.

10:45.667 --> 10:49.133
- 100 percent, dude, I treated
her like a ----ing queen, dude.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.767
- Yeah, she, uh,
she moved on fast, man.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.500
- I'm so over everything
that I'm like,

10:54.533 --> 10:56.233
I just honestly
wish her the best,

10:56.266 --> 10:59.533
and I-I kind of feel bad
for him, a little bit.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.266
But like--

11:01.266 --> 11:02.734
- Enough.
- Dude.

11:02.767 --> 11:05.266
- If he's happy, she's happy,
I'm cool with it.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.033
Like, just--
- She makes sure

11:07.066 --> 11:08.700
everyone knows
that they're happy.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.300
90 percent of the sentences
that come out of her mouth

11:11.300 --> 11:14.000
start with "well, Rob and I."
All right, I mean,

11:14.033 --> 11:16.533
I like that she loves him, but
it gets to be a little much.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.166
- Rob and I--
Rob and I are going to

11:18.200 --> 11:20.533
have like, two kids.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob,

11:20.567 --> 11:24.500
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob,
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.300
- I know Scheana
and Rob are happy.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.367
I can see that.
The whole world can see it.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.567
Because she's constantly
projecting it on social media

11:31.567 --> 11:33.400
and to all of us.
Come to think of it,

11:33.433 --> 11:36.133
she kind of did this
with Shay, too, you know?

11:36.166 --> 11:39.433
She was always touting how
perfect their relationship is.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.367
As we all found out,
it wasn't.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.033
Who knows, maybe someday,
you guys will be able

11:44.033 --> 11:45.433
to grab a drink together.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.166
- Probably not.
- Too soon.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.333
- I was forgetting
all the sh-- that happened

11:51.333 --> 11:53.066
between you guys,
I just feel like

11:53.066 --> 11:54.700
you're both just so
much better off now.

11:57.734 --> 12:03.400
♪ ♪

12:03.433 --> 12:06.700
- What's the difference
between ravioli and risotto?

12:06.734 --> 12:09.033
I know what ravioli is,
I just don't know...

12:09.066 --> 12:10.700
- It's like a
different type of pasta.

12:10.734 --> 12:12.266
Is it pasta or is it grain?

12:12.300 --> 12:13.734
- It's more like a rice,
I think.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.033
- Right, like ravioli is pasta,
you know, so.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.734
- Yeah, that's pasta.
- Yeah, I forget

12:17.767 --> 12:19.333
what tagliolini is like,
I think it's like

12:19.333 --> 12:21.300
a little thicker,
but it is pasta.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.066
- Well, cheers
to where we are today

12:24.100 --> 12:25.567
because I've
never been happier.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.033
- Cheers.
- Excellent, excellent.

12:28.066 --> 12:31.500
- That's so good to know,
because clearly,

12:31.533 --> 12:33.600
you moved kind of fast.

12:33.633 --> 12:36.333
Like, I don't know
how you guys met each other,

12:36.367 --> 12:38.433
or like, your history, but--
- So we dated

12:38.467 --> 12:40.166
like, ten years ago.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.567
He was working the door
at a club

12:41.600 --> 12:43.033
I would go to all the time.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.367
I want to say this
the right way,

12:44.400 --> 12:46.166
because I don't want it
to sound like

12:46.200 --> 12:48.200
I married someone and was
in love with someone else.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.633
But it just--
He was kind of like,

12:49.633 --> 12:51.333
the one that got away.

12:51.367 --> 12:56.066
Let's just say Rob and I,
over the past 11 years,

12:56.100 --> 12:59.433
have had a lot
of firsts together.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.100
- I mean, not in my vagina.

13:07.633 --> 13:10.633
- She was actually the
first girl ever to reject me.

13:10.667 --> 13:13.266
She was walking out, and she
was wearing a black dress,

13:13.266 --> 13:15.100
and was like, hey, what's up?
You're really pretty.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.367
You want to go
hang out sometime?

13:16.400 --> 13:19.066
She goes, no.
And just walks away.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.633
And I was like,
oh, no, she didn't.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.133
I was like,
I will get that one.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.200
And you know, the biggest thing
for a guy is like,

13:25.233 --> 13:26.767
until your career
is really going,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.533
until once you start finding
the thing you want to do

13:28.533 --> 13:30.400
for the rest of your life,
and you're doing it,

13:30.433 --> 13:33.400
that's when you're ready
to start settling down.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.266
You know, because I was
actually dating someone

13:35.266 --> 13:37.667
before her, who on paper,
you'd be like,

13:37.667 --> 13:39.400
you're stupid
to break up with her.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.600
Dated her--I was dating her
for like, three years.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.266
She was a princess.
Like, her dad's

13:43.266 --> 13:45.433
the sultan of Burnai.
Er, the prince of Burnai.

13:47.667 --> 13:51.633
- Oh, God, Scheana's boyfriend,
Rob, seems like a nice guy,

13:51.667 --> 13:55.266
but, you know, Rob's definitely
a step up from Shay.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.533
I don't mean it, but it's like,

13:56.567 --> 13:59.133
I don't know.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.433
Whatever.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.633
- And like,
sweet time, amazing.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.700
But at the end of the day,
I just wasn't ready.

14:04.734 --> 14:06.433
- Well, you also said
that you loved her

14:06.467 --> 14:08.300
but you never said
you were in love with her.

14:08.300 --> 14:11.100
- But yeah, it's crazy
what a year will do.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.500
- Yeah, we've had a lot
of good times together.

14:13.533 --> 14:17.500
I've literally never been
this happy in my entire life.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.767
it, you know?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.567
Onto bigger and better, so.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.166
- Literally.
- Ah!

14:25.166 --> 14:28.433
Didn't mean it like that,
but thank yo

14:28.433 --> 14:30.433
- I hate love when
it's shoved down your throat.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.133
I'm like, shut up.

14:32.133 --> 14:34.333
He's not ----ing
Iron Man, okay?

14:34.333 --> 14:38.300
He's Rob "Varalta."

it's hitting a knot.

- I kinda have a stack

14:48.300 --> 14:50.333
of walls here, do you think you
guys could get them done?

14:50.333 --> 14:52.333
- If your dad sees this,
you're ----ed.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.000
- Welcome back to
"Vanderpump Rules:

15:05.033 --> 15:06.700
Secrets Revealed."

15:06.734 --> 15:09.600
Katie, how did it feel watching
your husband tell Brittany

15:09.600 --> 15:12.000
he would lie to cover
for him cheating?

15:12.033 --> 15:14.166
- In that moment
where she's going to Tom,

15:14.200 --> 15:16.233
and she's like,
what do you know about this?

15:16.233 --> 15:18.300
I mean, I don't think
you were considering

15:18.333 --> 15:19.767
how she was feeling
in that moment.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.633
- I'll be honest with you,
even if it was true,

15:21.667 --> 15:23.567
I would cover for him,
but I've never heard

15:23.600 --> 15:25.333
anything about that,
and as far as I know,

15:25.367 --> 15:26.633
Jax has been wonderful.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.367
- I would, but I'm not
covering for him.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.633
I think it was my way
of further emphasizing

15:31.633 --> 15:34.467
just how shocked I was, too.
Because I'll be honest,

15:34.500 --> 15:36.567
in the past, we have, you know,
sometimes, you'll pull me aside

15:36.600 --> 15:39.100
and he'll show me pictures,
or, like, you know,

15:39.133 --> 15:40.600
like, hey man, I hooked up
with this chick.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.467
And like, you know,
back in the day,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.333
in other relationships,
but he had never done that once

15:44.367 --> 15:46.100
while he was with Brittany.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.500
- How can they grow if
they've got this kind of like,

15:48.500 --> 15:50.633
you know, alibi,
or this, you know,

15:50.633 --> 15:52.567
somebody on their side
supporting them, saying,

15:52.600 --> 15:54.433
oh, no, well, maybe
I didn't do it.

15:54.467 --> 15:57.100
But I do feel that Jax has--

15:57.133 --> 15:59.633
because after speaking to
Brittany at length,

15:59.667 --> 16:02.133
you know, this has really
shaken him

16:02.166 --> 16:06.200
to the core, enough to really
kind of really invoke change.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
- The reason I decided to do
Habitat for Humanity

16:29.000 --> 16:31.133
is because I just wanted
to do something different

16:31.133 --> 16:32.734
that's out of my norm.

16:32.767 --> 16:36.133
Nobody wants to see that, ugh.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.300
- Building this house,

this is going to
help a family live.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.033

but we're talking about
the wood studs.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.166
- All right, let's do it.
Jax, you want to pound or hold?

16:53.166 --> 16:55.533
- I'm not holding anything
with you.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.567
- I come from
a long line of men

16:57.567 --> 16:59.033
who are good
with their hands.

16:59.033 --> 17:00.300
Ow, .

17:00.333 --> 17:02.233
It's hitting a knot
or something.

17:02.266 --> 17:04.033
I feel like it's in my DNA.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.700
It's like,
it just started bending.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.567
- If your dad sees this,
you're ----ed.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.433
- Just take it out.
- Dude, help her out.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.266
- Dude, chill.
- It's awkward.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.233
- I kind of have
a stack of walls here.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.133
You think you guys can get them
done by the end of the day?

17:15.166 --> 17:16.567
Maybe?
- Yeah.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.567
- Oh, my gosh, we're off.
Hold up, hold up.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.567
- Oh, it's--
- Just knock it out

17:20.600 --> 17:22.533
and reset it.
- My fault.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.033
- It's okay.

17:24.066 --> 17:26.300

so many holes.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.333

where's the hammer?

17:31.367 --> 17:32.734
- In the kitchen.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.000
I'm hungry.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.600
- Shut up.

17:35.633 --> 17:38.567

already put together.

an appointment

17:41.467 --> 17:43.600

17:43.600 --> 17:45.200

17:52.600 --> 17:56.467

alcohol, and extramarital sex?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.266

triple threat.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.233

a mess right here.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.033

somewhat proactive.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.734
Let's go cheat,
it stems from something.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.233

that matters to them!

18:21.767 --> 18:23.333

- Yes, be more productive

okay, so this happened.

- I mean, for surgery.
- Are you allergic

19:12.133 --> 19:14.100
to anything at all?
- Rabbits.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.133
- All right, there's no rabbits
in here, so that's good.

19:16.133 --> 19:18.467
Basically, it's saline
mixed with different vitamins.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.667
B12, Vitamin C, B complex,
glutathione.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.133

19:27.166 --> 19:30.233

have someone come over,

19:35.433 --> 19:38.166
put a needle right here,
give me vitamins,

19:38.166 --> 19:40.700

19:40.700 --> 19:43.100
Which is about to drink
all over again.

19:43.133 --> 19:44.700
- If Tom walked in right now,
he would pass out.

19:44.734 --> 19:47.433
- Could I get certified
to do it to myself?

19:47.467 --> 19:49.533
- Mm, maybe in Mexico.
Not here.

19:49.567 --> 19:52.500
- I'm having more fun when I
drink my smoothie and do this

19:52.533 --> 19:54.000
than I do a night out.

19:54.033 --> 19:55.567
- I'll take
my tequila shots, so.

19:55.567 --> 19:56.767
- Have you ever
done it to somebody

19:57.000 --> 19:58.567
while they're drinking?

19:58.567 --> 20:00.700
- There are people who insist,
I tell them you can't.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.400

a skosh of a hangover,

20:03.433 --> 20:06.333
I can do the breakfast burrito
and some Advil,

20:06.333 --> 20:08.400
but for the big guys,
you've got to call in

20:08.433 --> 20:10.266

20:10.300 --> 20:13.200
- Ladies, I'm going to go.

20:13.233 --> 20:14.266

You just got an IV.

20:27.467 --> 20:31.200
Maybe like, let it do
its thing, before you like...

20:31.200 --> 20:33.600

because he's picking fights

20:33.633 --> 20:36.066
with me,
and he's not talking to me.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.600
So now, we're communicating
via email.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.166
- Oh, no.
- I feel like I'm 15 years old.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.467
Patrick is a phenomenal arguer.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.467
His vernacular is robust.

20:46.467 --> 20:50.367
He like, vernaculars me
into submission.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.100
If that makes sense.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.066
You can't keep doing this.
You can't keep looking

20:54.100 --> 20:55.633
at things I've done
in the past, or like--

20:55.667 --> 20:57.500
If I did that,
I'd ----ing go nuts.

20:57.533 --> 20:59.166
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.467
- But then I texted him,
I was like, fine.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.333
You know what, I'm just going
to go text other dudes.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.100
I'm going to go
hook up with another dude

21:05.133 --> 21:07.467
if you're not interested in me
or whatever.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.767
- No.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.767
- So now, he thinks
I cheated on him.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.567
- It's so much easier
to give advice than to take it.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.200
It seems like me and Stassi
have something in common,

21:16.233 --> 21:18.500
to where we have this need

21:18.533 --> 21:20.767

21:20.767 --> 21:22.467
We know what
we're supposed to do,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.100
but our heart just takes over.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.066
- Whenever I tell Tom,
you think I'm crazy?

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
There's crazier
out there, hello.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.000
- I'm only crazy because Jax
made me that way.

21:32.033 --> 21:34.233
- I'm only crazy because Jax
made me that way.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.066

21:54.300 --> 21:57.200

I was always messing with him,

You're as successful as he is.

39:03.700 --> 39:06.100

a modicum of respect.

Okay, but I wasn't.
