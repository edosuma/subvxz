WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.820
HARRY: <i>I'm Harry Tasker,</i>
<i>husband, dad, computer salesman,</i>

00:05.020 --> 00:07.950
<i>and for 17 years the most</i>
<i>important person in my life</i>

00:08.150 --> 00:10.040
<i>didn't know</i>
<i>I was also something else.</i>

00:11.040 --> 00:13.330
<i>Omega Sector's top spy.</i>

00:13.530 --> 00:14.960
HELEN:
<i>I'm Helen Tasker,</i>

00:15.160 --> 00:16.730
<i>wife, mom and professor.</i>

00:16.930 --> 00:18.560
<i>After an unfortunate incident</i>

00:18.760 --> 00:21.100
<i>where I found out</i>
<i>our whole life was a lie,</i>

00:21.300 --> 00:23.820
<i>now I'm also a spy.</i>

00:24.690 --> 00:26.640
HARRY:
<i>Honey, all those things</i>
<i>are true.</i>

00:26.840 --> 00:28.340
<i>They're just, you know.</i>
HELEN: <i>What?</i>

00:28.540 --> 00:31.060
HARRY:
<i>True lies.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:36.430
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:39.540 --> 00:41.600
<i>(applause)</i>

00:45.010 --> 00:46.290
Thank you.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.610
Thank you for the invitation
to speak here today.

00:50.580 --> 00:53.630
We live in a dangerous time.

00:53.830 --> 00:54.770
GUARD:
Security check-in. North gate.

00:54.970 --> 00:56.800
GUARD 2:
North gate, all clear.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.690
GUARD:
Perimeter check. East gate.

01:00.090 --> 01:01.890
All clear.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.900
(high-pitched whirring)

01:17.470 --> 01:19.830
(indistinct chatter)

01:20.030 --> 01:22.450
(chatter stops)

01:24.110 --> 01:26.000
(high-pitched hum)

01:26.200 --> 01:30.720
(groaning)

01:38.190 --> 01:40.100
(people screaming)

01:45.400 --> 01:46.770
Go, go, go, go!

01:48.040 --> 01:50.640
(shouting in German)

02:03.190 --> 02:05.450
* *

02:12.930 --> 02:16.250
COMPUTER: <i>The unknown assailants</i>
<i>evaded all security measures.</i>

02:16.450 --> 02:18.670
<i>Threat level: red.</i>

02:20.870 --> 02:22.760
That happened this morning

02:22.960 --> 02:25.760
at an international summit
in Brussels.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.400
The victim was an Albanian
right-wing politician.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.430
Do we know who's behind it?
TRILBY: No.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.170
The Albanians
are sure it was Serbia,

02:33.370 --> 02:34.370
so they're massing troops

02:34.570 --> 02:35.870
on the border.

02:36.070 --> 02:38.500
Serbia thinks it was the
Albanians trying to justify

02:38.700 --> 02:39.840
an attack, and

02:40.040 --> 02:41.540
they're arming up too.
MARIA: If they start

02:41.740 --> 02:43.910
shooting, that's
tens of thousands dead, easy.

02:44.110 --> 02:47.410
Plus a few million refugees.
Can we calm this down?

02:47.610 --> 02:48.750
Not likely.

02:48.950 --> 02:50.250
The assassins just
put out a statement

02:50.450 --> 02:52.120
promising more killings.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.420
We have to stop

02:53.620 --> 02:55.250
the assassins
before things get hot

02:55.450 --> 02:56.520
and the nuclear powers

02:56.720 --> 02:58.760
get into it. So,
in the spirit of

02:58.960 --> 03:01.630
"it takes one to know one,"
I'm bringing in help.

03:01.830 --> 03:04.600
A top assassin we've
contracted with a few times.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.970
Oh my God, you don't mean...

03:07.170 --> 03:08.670
The Wolf. Yes.

03:08.870 --> 03:10.970
He's found assassins
for us before.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.910
He took out that guy
who bombed the Athens station.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.170
He has...

03:15.370 --> 03:17.210
a knack.

03:17.410 --> 03:18.440
The Wolf? You sure?

03:18.640 --> 03:20.550
'Cause we don't usually
work with him.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.450
I mean, he is a contractor, so

03:22.650 --> 03:25.520
we can distance ourselves
from the... icky stuff.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.090
Do you want to know what's icky?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.420
Shooting an innocent man
in cold blood.

03:29.620 --> 03:32.990
I'll work with anyone who can
stop that from happening again.

03:33.190 --> 03:34.190
Study up on

03:34.390 --> 03:35.660
the assassination.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.050
The Wolf arrives tomorrow.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.740
The Wolf. Wow.
MARIA: You guys

03:42.940 --> 03:45.600
hear about that time he
waited for five days in a tree

03:45.800 --> 03:47.810
to get a shot at that warlord
in Myanmar?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.440
Epic.
Doesn't he always work alone?
GIB: Yeah.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.510
I've been here since Myspace was
poppin', and even I don't know

03:53.710 --> 03:55.210
somebody who's
crossed paths with him.

03:55.410 --> 03:56.750
HARRY: I almost did.
What?

03:56.950 --> 03:58.250
The Athens station op.

03:58.450 --> 03:59.420
You never told
me about that.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.090
Yeah, 'cause it freaked me out.

04:01.290 --> 04:02.590
I ran cleanup.

04:02.790 --> 04:03.920
The witnesses
were hysterical.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.790
Everybody was screaming
and talking about

04:05.990 --> 04:09.850
how the Wolf's eyes were
"bottomless wells of darkness."

04:11.080 --> 04:13.630
Assassins aren't
meant to be cuddly.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.800
And there aren't any more
problems in Athens, so...

04:16.000 --> 04:18.200
Yeah, okay, but do you know
why I didn't meet him?

04:18.400 --> 04:20.170
Because he went and had a gyro.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.480
I mean, what kind of person
slaughters someone

04:22.680 --> 04:25.240
and then goes and eats a gyro?

04:25.440 --> 04:26.910
A frickin' legend.
MARIA: Yeah.

04:27.110 --> 04:29.450
Who doesn't love gyros?
It's pita and lamb-- delicious.

04:29.650 --> 04:30.580
HARRY:
I'm just saying

04:30.780 --> 04:31.880
that he's not like us.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.520
He doesn't think like we think.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.870
No, he thinks like an assassin.
That's why we need him.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.930
Still at it?

04:44.130 --> 04:44.960
Yeah.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.100
Yeah, I had a tough day, too.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.540
Sometimes it's hard being the
only trainee at Omega, you know?

04:51.740 --> 04:53.440
Mm-hmm.
It's like,

04:53.640 --> 04:55.670
I'm in weapons training, and
I swear to you the M4 carbine

04:55.870 --> 04:58.410
is put together like
some jigsaw puzzle.

04:58.610 --> 05:01.380
And it's not like
I have any friends

05:01.580 --> 05:03.620
I can get together
for a study group.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.250
Yeah, I know.
Plus, Dana and Jake

05:06.450 --> 05:08.250
are away at camp, so

05:08.450 --> 05:11.210
it's lonely here, too.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.660
Which is why

05:14.860 --> 05:16.700
I'm adopting a chimpanzee.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.530
That's nice, dear.
Harry!

05:18.730 --> 05:21.770
You're not even listening.
I'm sorry.

05:21.970 --> 05:23.970
It's just,
I got a new assignment

05:24.170 --> 05:26.200
and some of the players
are a little scary.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.510
Oh? How are they scary?
You've got too much

05:28.710 --> 05:30.140
on your plate. No need
to worry about this.

05:30.340 --> 05:32.580
But I want to. I want
to be a part of things.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.980
I want to be a part of the team.

05:35.180 --> 05:37.350
You have to finish
your training, babe.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.850
We all had to go through it.

05:39.050 --> 05:40.590
Yeah, but maybe I
could help a little right now.

05:40.790 --> 05:41.850
Troops are massing

05:42.050 --> 05:43.220
on the Serbian border
as we speak.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.590
I'm trying to
prevent a war here.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.190
Okay, I'll just go to bed.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.860
Sorry.
Good night.

05:50.060 --> 05:52.380
Good night.
I love you.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.150
You're adopting a chimpanzee?

05:57.050 --> 05:58.270
When assembling a 4-16,

05:58.470 --> 06:01.710
it's very important
to oil your weapon

06:01.910 --> 06:03.940
at every stage.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.850
So, after you oil the bolt,

06:07.050 --> 06:10.580
you want to brush it ten times.
Like this.

06:10.780 --> 06:14.120
One time, two time,

06:14.320 --> 06:17.220
and a three and a four,

06:17.420 --> 06:19.660
a five and six...

06:19.860 --> 06:21.360
Ms. Tasker?

06:21.560 --> 06:23.060
Are you with us?

06:23.260 --> 06:24.100
Wha... Yeah.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.130
I'm with you. Totally.
Okay.

06:26.330 --> 06:27.970
Without referring
to the diagram,

06:28.170 --> 06:31.650
identify the spent
brass deflector.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.650
(watch beeps)

06:39.850 --> 06:41.360
Oh. That's lunch.
(chuckles)

06:43.630 --> 06:45.720
We'll pick this up later.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.300
(quiet chatter)

06:51.670 --> 06:53.430
And listen, I said,
"Baby, I'm trained

06:53.630 --> 06:55.660
in sleep deprivation tactics."

06:55.860 --> 06:57.050
Ooh! (chuckles)

07:12.530 --> 07:13.810
May I?

07:14.010 --> 07:15.480
No, no, not at all.
(chuckles)

07:15.680 --> 07:17.180
Thank you.
Sure.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.750
Sort of feels like
the new girl in school.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.790
Are you... are you
n-new to Omega?

07:22.990 --> 07:24.760
Yeah.
I'm in training.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.160
I'm the only trainee, so...

07:27.360 --> 07:28.990
That's why you're
stuck with

07:29.190 --> 07:31.700
the weird dude eating
tuna fish sandwiches.
(laughs)

07:31.900 --> 07:35.170
The-the nice dude
who allowed me to join him.

07:35.370 --> 07:37.170
It's rough being
the new kid, I know.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.270
I moved a lot
when I was young.

07:39.470 --> 07:40.540
I did, too.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.480
Uh, my family and I, we moved
here from Manila

07:42.680 --> 07:44.080
when I was in about third grade.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.880
And I didn't speak any English,
so, that time,

07:47.080 --> 07:49.380
I just, you know, ate lunch
in the bathroom for a week.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.380
That's... that's horrible.

07:52.590 --> 07:55.050
I mean, it was a good motivator,
too, you know?

07:55.250 --> 07:57.790
I ended up speaking English
by winter break.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.390
Yeah, I couldn't stand
being the weird kid.

07:59.590 --> 08:01.190
Boy, I get that.

08:01.390 --> 08:03.860
I was always the kid
with the weird hobbies.

08:04.060 --> 08:07.800
I guess I smile at all the
wrong times, too, so...

08:08.000 --> 08:10.970
Oh, is there
a wrong time to smile?

08:11.170 --> 08:13.110
Apparently. Kids were
very scared of me.

08:13.310 --> 08:14.840
But my mom
would train me

08:15.040 --> 08:17.780
to research
the other kids.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.650
So I could figure
out what was cool

08:19.850 --> 08:22.980
or, you know,
what they liked.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.150
Oh. Why?

08:24.350 --> 08:26.320
So I could pretend
to be normal.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.750
Well, you know,
maybe it wasn't pretending.

08:28.950 --> 08:30.690
Maybe it was

08:30.890 --> 08:33.910
planting the seed
of who you could be.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.030
I like that.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.420
I've never heard
that. A seed?

08:42.890 --> 08:45.140
That's very nice.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.210
Uh, oh... Shoot,
I have a...

08:48.410 --> 08:51.040
I have a... I'm
on a new mission.
Oh.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.710
So, it's got a clock on it.

08:52.910 --> 08:54.510
I-I have to go.

08:54.710 --> 08:55.780
Okay.

08:55.980 --> 08:57.950
Well, it was lovely
chatting with you.

08:58.150 --> 08:59.750
I'm Helen, by the way.
Oh, hey, Helen.

08:59.950 --> 09:03.320
Uh, they... they call me
the, uh, the Wolf.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.860
Oh. (roars) The Wolf.

09:05.060 --> 09:05.920
(chuckles) So scary.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.530
(howls, chuckles)

09:07.730 --> 09:09.660
No, really, what's your...
what's your real name?

09:09.860 --> 09:12.300
Oh. Wow. Um...

09:12.500 --> 09:13.570
(short chuckle)

09:13.770 --> 09:16.020
Nobody's ever asked me that.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.970
It's Nathan.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.810
Well, it's nice
meeting you, Nathan.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.510
That was very fun.
(chuckles)

09:21.710 --> 09:23.290
Thank you.

09:30.030 --> 09:32.000
A-Are you guys here
for the 1:00?

09:35.440 --> 09:36.690
The Wolf?

09:36.890 --> 09:38.220
Yes, hi.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.320
Hey.
Hey.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.960
Or is it...
Do you prefer Mr. Wolf?

09:41.160 --> 09:42.900
Wolf, the Wolf,
Mr. Wolf, whatever.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.300
You're Luther, right?
Yeah.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.800
I heard about the ops you ran
down in Ecuador.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.530
(exclaims)

09:48.730 --> 09:50.100
That was
amazing.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.740
The Wolf knows about my op.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.840
MARIA:
Okay, all right, settle down.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.610
Maria Ruiz.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.210
Looking forward
to working together.

09:57.410 --> 09:59.210
The youngest Omega recruit ever.

09:59.410 --> 09:59.980
That's right.

10:00.180 --> 10:01.610
Oh! Excuse me.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.980
And you must be Albert Gibson.
You wrote the white papers

10:05.180 --> 10:06.480
on comm unit etiquette?

10:06.690 --> 10:09.290
You read it? Wow.
Nobody reads those.

10:09.490 --> 10:10.860
It's really powerful stuff.
They should.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.190
Harry Tasker,

10:12.390 --> 10:14.660
who ran cleanup
for me in Athens.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.160
Thank you for that, by the way.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.360
That op was, uh...
pretty grisly, huh?

10:19.560 --> 10:23.250
Really? I just think about
the gyros. Dee-lish.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.040
Okay, all right, maybe
we should get started.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.440
We just made a run
on our contacts in Serbia

10:28.640 --> 10:31.510
to try to get a lead
on the assassins here.

10:31.710 --> 10:33.350
Oh, I, uh, I actually went
over this case last night.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.610
I don't think there is
any cheese down that hole.

10:35.810 --> 10:38.420
Well, it could be the Albanians
taking out one of their own.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.720
Could justify an invasion.
I was wor...
Uh... I-I don't mean

10:41.920 --> 10:43.590
to interrupt, it just
doesn't feel right either.

10:43.790 --> 10:48.130
Any Albanian assassin is gonna
use the Dragunov SVD rifle.

10:48.330 --> 10:51.830
Serbians are all about their
M91s. But these guys...

10:52.030 --> 10:53.770
Um, do you mind if I...

10:53.970 --> 10:56.130
Oh, no, no.
Sorry, the...

10:56.330 --> 10:58.900
After the attack they left
a sound weapon behind.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.810
This is their weapon of choice.

11:01.010 --> 11:02.570
Yeah, yeah, we're aware.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.880
Yeah, but you have to think
about what that means.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.350
They wanted us to
find that. Why?

11:07.550 --> 11:08.980
They wanted people
to know about it.

11:09.180 --> 11:11.000
Because they want
to sell more weapons.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.020
They just need
a market.

11:13.220 --> 11:15.390
Like a war in the Balkans.
They're weapons dealers.

11:15.590 --> 11:18.260
Yes. Assassinate
the right politicians,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.260
start a war, rake in billions.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.960
Shampoo, rinse,
repeat.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.460
Just, wow. That's a great
theory. Super smart.

11:24.660 --> 11:26.770
Thanks. I mean,
it's just, you know,

11:26.970 --> 11:28.400
what I would do, so...

11:28.600 --> 11:31.270
Wait, what?
That's what you would do?

11:31.470 --> 11:32.670
So, we're looking
for people selling

11:32.870 --> 11:35.040
high-tech weapons
on the black market.
Yes.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.180
Especially people with
black ops backgrounds.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.380
All right, well, here we go,
team, let's get to it.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.810
Yes, sir.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.780
HELEN:
<i>And then</i>

11:42.980 --> 11:44.720
he told me this
super sweet story

11:44.920 --> 11:47.850
about how his mom would have him
research his fellow classmates

11:48.050 --> 11:50.020
to make friends.
I was just like,

11:50.220 --> 11:52.670
"Where do I sign up
for that mom school?"

11:54.110 --> 11:55.260
Harry?
Hmm?

11:55.460 --> 11:56.760
Are you hearing a word
that I'm saying?

11:56.960 --> 11:58.860
Yes, yes, all the words.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.480
Oh, okay,
what's my new friend's name?

12:02.320 --> 12:04.400
Nelson.
Nathan.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.740
Harry, come on.

12:05.940 --> 12:06.910
I'm sorry, babe, it was just

12:07.110 --> 12:08.540
a really weird day
at work today.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.010
Okay, well...
Helen,

12:10.210 --> 12:12.390
did you see that?
See what?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.420
Something's outside.
How?

12:17.620 --> 12:19.920
I thought we had a super tight
Omega security system.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.820
Yes, we do. It should be going
off. But I know someone's there.

12:22.020 --> 12:24.210
Stay out of sight.
Okay.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.910
Hey, Harry.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.340
How did you get past my
security? I would've shot you.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.040
(chuckles)
That's funny.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.280
No, I'm serious. Why didn't you
just come to the front door?

12:47.480 --> 12:50.220
Oh, I don't-I don't really enter
buildings that way, I guess.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.320
I like to stick to the shadows.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.590
That's kinda
my thing.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.450
Nathan?

12:55.650 --> 12:56.450
(gasps) Helen?!

12:56.650 --> 12:57.690
What-what are you doing here?

12:57.890 --> 12:58.990
Oh my God,
are you...

12:59.190 --> 13:01.360
Oh... Are you and Harry...
We're married.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.560
What?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.130
Wait, are you
working with Harry?

13:04.330 --> 13:06.300
I am.
They brought me on the team.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.800
Oh, my gosh.
Harry, I can't believe

13:08.000 --> 13:10.340
you're working with Nathan.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.400
That's so fun.
That's so fun.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.190
Super fun.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.020
HELEN:
You take any cream or sugar?
No, thank you.

13:23.220 --> 13:26.120
This is perfect. I like it...
I like it dark. (clears throat)

13:26.320 --> 13:29.750
So, Harry,
I came by tonight because

13:29.960 --> 13:31.460
I've learned over the years
to pay attention

13:31.660 --> 13:33.430
to people's body language,

13:33.630 --> 13:34.890
and-and today,
in the meeting,

13:35.090 --> 13:37.700
he-he was very
hunchy with his shoulders.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.000
And so I ju-I just wanted
to make sure

13:40.200 --> 13:41.430
we were all good.

13:41.630 --> 13:43.140
Yeah. We're all good.
Are you sure?

13:43.340 --> 13:45.170
'Cause you seem
a little uncomfortable.

13:45.370 --> 13:47.070
Yeah, honey.

13:47.270 --> 13:49.640
You do.
Right?

13:49.840 --> 13:52.580
Well, you did breach
our security perimeter.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.280
(chuckles)
How did you do that?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.510
Once you get the hang of how to
bypass an Omega security system,

13:56.710 --> 13:58.280
it's easy peasy.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.780
Easy peasy-- yes,

13:59.990 --> 14:01.650
that is what they said
about my weapons training.

14:01.850 --> 14:02.860
But I can't
put together

14:03.060 --> 14:05.770
an M4 Carbine to save my life.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.860
A-An M-4?
Yeah.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.330
I can help you with that.
I actually wrote this song.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.730
* The barrel screws into
the front sight mount *

14:12.930 --> 14:15.370
* Complete, and the
flip-up sight's connected to *

14:15.570 --> 14:16.670
* The charging assembly... *

14:16.870 --> 14:18.570
And... And...

14:18.770 --> 14:19.640
I mean, it goes on.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.210
There's 136 pieces, but, um...

14:22.410 --> 14:23.510
I have a great idea.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.140
How about I train you?
(gasps)

14:26.340 --> 14:27.850
No. No, no, no, no.

14:28.050 --> 14:28.880
I don't think
that's a good idea,

14:29.080 --> 14:30.250
because we have the mission.

14:30.450 --> 14:33.350
That's fine.
I do my best thinking

14:33.550 --> 14:34.590
when I'm shooting.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.820
What do you say?

14:36.020 --> 14:37.320
After I train you,
you'll be able

14:37.520 --> 14:38.920
to shoot a filling out
of a bad guy's mouth at,

14:39.120 --> 14:41.430
like, a thousand yards.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.660
So, you'll be the Wolf and

14:42.860 --> 14:43.830
I'll be the Dentist!
Be the Dentist!

14:44.030 --> 14:45.200
(squeals)
Oh!

14:45.400 --> 14:46.660
Jinx! You owe me a Coke!
Jinx! You owe me a Coke!

14:46.860 --> 14:48.330
(both laughing)

14:48.530 --> 14:51.670
Guys? Guys, I-I don't think that
this is such a good idea.

14:51.870 --> 14:52.770
No, it's settled.
Yeah.

14:52.970 --> 14:53.840
We start tomorrow.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.440
Harry, isn't this great?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.510
Mm.
Uh...

14:57.710 --> 14:59.280
I should probably get going.
I'm gonna go out the back door.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.550
The-the front door...
I want to try an escape route.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.750
Mm.
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:02.950 --> 15:03.950
Go out the front door.
Bye, Harry.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.420
Front door...
(laughing)

15:05.620 --> 15:07.390
Bye.

15:07.590 --> 15:08.950
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.560
(door closes)
Oh...

15:10.760 --> 15:12.760
That was...
So great.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.760
Now Nathan can
train me and I'm not

15:14.960 --> 15:17.350
gonna feel so lonely at work.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.900
And then he hopped
my back fence,

15:22.100 --> 15:24.440
snuck right past my security,
up to my kitchen door

15:24.640 --> 15:26.200
to make sure
I was comfortable?

15:26.400 --> 15:29.310
Well, that was nice of him.
Nice? It's weird.

15:29.510 --> 15:31.480
He offered to take over
Helen's weapons training.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.680
I keep thinking about
those people in Athens

15:33.880 --> 15:35.380
who couldn't
stop screaming.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.720
I mean, would you want
him training your wife?

15:37.920 --> 15:40.190
I'm not married.
Bam. I got something.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.020
All right, Wolf checked out
the profiles

15:42.220 --> 15:45.820
that we came up with-- he likes
this guy for the assassination.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.430
Ulrich Müller was
an assassin for

15:48.630 --> 15:49.830
German intelligence,
went rogue.

15:50.030 --> 15:51.830
Links to shady high-tech
weapons dealers,

15:52.030 --> 15:53.700
including one who's
currently in talks

15:53.900 --> 15:56.100
with both the Albanians
and the Serbians.
A lot of the targets

15:56.300 --> 15:58.400
on our list are selling
to both sides.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.110
Yeah, but this one was
at a train station

16:01.310 --> 16:03.440
in Belgium the day
before the assassination.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.240
Oh, look.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.640
There he is again

16:06.840 --> 16:09.500
at Dulles Airport on Tuesday.

16:11.030 --> 16:13.050
Which means
the next hit is here.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.050
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that's what it looks like.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.520
All right, I'm gonna
get an APB going.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.120
We got to try to find this guy
before he hits again.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.930
Well, good, looks like
the Wolf did his job.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.490
I'll let him know he can go.

16:22.690 --> 16:26.130
Go? Harry, we got an assassin
on the loose in the D.C. area.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.600
We need to be looking at
targets, evaluating intel.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.390
Wolf's just getting started.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.840
WOLF:
Just like that, easy peasy.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.350
I cannot do it that fast.
That is like lightning.

16:41.550 --> 16:43.550
Well, I am an assassin,
so, you know...

16:43.750 --> 16:47.690
Oh. Is that... is that
your actual job description?

16:47.890 --> 16:49.300
Yeah, did they
not... Did...

16:50.170 --> 16:51.260
Nobody mentioned that?

16:51.460 --> 16:53.160
Well, I...
No, I kind of put together

16:53.360 --> 16:54.960
that you were helping
to catch assassins.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.290
But you're not...

16:56.490 --> 16:57.560
Well, I mean,

16:57.760 --> 16:59.660
you work
for Omega Sector, right?

16:59.860 --> 17:00.730
Yeah.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.130
So, you only go after threats

17:02.330 --> 17:04.670
that they send to you or...

17:04.870 --> 17:06.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.440
I don't-I don't just
walk around and-- pew, pew!--

17:08.640 --> 17:10.580
assassinate random people.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.410
I mean, it's
like being

17:12.610 --> 17:15.080
an accountant. You don't just
pick people off the street

17:15.280 --> 17:17.070
and then do their taxes.

17:17.870 --> 17:18.950
Do you like it?

17:19.150 --> 17:24.570
Um... do I-I like
being an assassin?

17:25.340 --> 17:26.790
I don't know. I mean,
I've never...

17:26.990 --> 17:28.390
never really thought about it.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.100
You've never really thought
about whether or not

17:30.300 --> 17:31.630
you like your job?
The thing is
I don't really

17:31.830 --> 17:33.230
feel feelings.
Like happiness

17:33.430 --> 17:34.830
or contentedness or whatever.

17:35.030 --> 17:36.800
I can't even
send, like,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.600
those little heart emojis.
Ding.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.900
I can't do that.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.670
That's so sad.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.480
I also don't feel sadness.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.810
It's kind of a good thing,
being an assassin,

17:46.010 --> 17:49.010
not feeling regret
or guilt or...

17:49.210 --> 17:50.820
No guilt?
I mean, that's amazing.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.520
I'm a working mom,
so that's all I feel.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.950
Yeah, I guess... I mean,
I guess it has its perks.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.090
But sometimes I worry

17:59.290 --> 18:04.030
that... I'm just broken
on the inside, somehow.

18:04.230 --> 18:08.630
And that I'm just pretending
to be a normal person.

18:08.830 --> 18:11.900
And that, maybe,
behind my eyes...

18:12.100 --> 18:14.460
there's just this, like...

18:17.060 --> 18:19.230
...empty darkness.

18:20.030 --> 18:26.280
Well, what I see is a light
and a person.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.850
You do?

18:28.050 --> 18:30.260
At least a seedling of a person.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.260
You and your seeds.
(laughs)

18:32.460 --> 18:34.160
A broken person
wouldn't do a nice thing

18:34.360 --> 18:36.230
like help me
with my weapons training.

18:36.430 --> 18:38.260
Yes! Time to shoot.
Are you ready?
(chuckles)

18:38.460 --> 18:39.930
Okay.
(gun clicking)

18:40.130 --> 18:41.330
(chuckles)

18:41.530 --> 18:43.140
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have, um,

18:43.340 --> 18:46.400
I brought, uh, my "chill mix"
to help you relax.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.390
("Open" by Grace Kay playing)
Ready?

18:51.190 --> 18:53.750
* Come a little closer to me *

18:53.950 --> 18:57.880
* Over where it's safer
to be surrounded *

18:58.080 --> 19:00.620
* And grounded *

19:00.820 --> 19:03.360
* Less fire
and more putting out *

19:03.560 --> 19:07.390
* A baby pink colored
throughout your senses *

19:07.590 --> 19:10.660
* Defenses *

19:10.860 --> 19:14.630
* And you could be open *

19:14.830 --> 19:19.290
* And we could be open *

19:20.590 --> 19:22.660
* Open. *

19:23.460 --> 19:27.280
And I got,
three bullseyes, Harry.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.710
I mean, Nathan makes
everything easy peasy.

19:29.910 --> 19:31.320
He's an
amazing teacher.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.350
Yeah, I wouldn't
go straight to "amazing."
(chuckles)

19:34.550 --> 19:36.390
Are you jealous?
Of Nathan?

19:36.590 --> 19:39.220
No. I mean, I don't think
you're gonna leave me

19:39.420 --> 19:42.890
for the Wolf or anything.
I'm just frustrated that no one

19:43.090 --> 19:44.260
sees what I see in this guy.
I mean,

19:44.460 --> 19:45.760
he kills people for a living.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.770
You have to kill some people
on missions, too, right?

19:47.970 --> 19:49.300
Yes, but it's different.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.640
When I shoot somebody,
I shoot 'em from the front,

19:51.840 --> 19:52.970
with honor.

19:53.170 --> 19:54.410
Do you know the Wolf's
signature move

19:54.610 --> 19:56.170
is two shots to the back
of the head?

19:56.370 --> 19:58.010
Oh. Do dead people care if
you shoot 'em in the front

19:58.210 --> 19:59.380
or the back of the head?
I don't know.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.510
It's the principle
of the thing, Helen.

20:01.710 --> 20:04.050
They send in the Wolf
when I turn down a job

20:04.250 --> 20:05.950
because I won't be able
to sleep at night.

20:06.150 --> 20:07.490
And I read the Wolf's file.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.990
Do you know how many times
he's turned down a job?

20:10.190 --> 20:11.920
Mm-mmm.
None times.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.330
And have I had
a hard job before? Yeah.

20:14.530 --> 20:18.430
So, sometimes I have to
go see the psych guy.

20:18.630 --> 20:21.470
Do you know how many times
the Wolf has seen the psych guy

20:21.670 --> 20:23.970
after an assassination?
None times!

20:24.170 --> 20:26.870
I swear, it's like the guy
flat-out doesn't care

20:27.070 --> 20:28.410
about killing people, ever.

20:28.610 --> 20:32.440
I wouldn't say that. I mean,

20:32.640 --> 20:35.280
just today he was worried
that he's a broken person.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.710
He is a broken person.

20:36.910 --> 20:38.850
That's what I'm saying.
He creeps me out.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.290
Well, it sounds like
he got you guys

20:40.490 --> 20:42.250
closer to catching
the assassins.
Did he?

20:42.450 --> 20:44.220
There's still gonna be
an assassination,

20:44.420 --> 20:45.520
but we just don't know
when or where.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.060
(watch buzzes)
Well...
Yeah, Gib?

20:47.260 --> 20:48.290
GIB: Hey, Harry,
the Wolf and me got a lead

20:48.490 --> 20:49.660
on when the next hit
is gonna be.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.160
Seriously? You...
GIB: The guy's incredible.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.670
I'm sending you the location.
Mm.

20:53.870 --> 20:55.970
See?
Helpful.

20:56.170 --> 20:58.390
All right. On my way.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.360
We're gonna talk
about this later.
Okay.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.200
(beeping)

21:15.640 --> 21:17.120
Hey.
The hit's going down here?

21:17.320 --> 21:19.260
What are they assassinating--
trees?

21:19.460 --> 21:22.060
(laughs) That's funny.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.500
I was just thinking
to myself, like,

21:23.700 --> 21:25.500
"How would I kick off
a giant war?"

21:25.700 --> 21:28.700
And I thought, "Oh, I would
kill the Serbian ambassador,

21:28.900 --> 21:30.970
and make it look
like Albania retaliated."

21:31.170 --> 21:32.300
I mean, I'd keep it quiet,

21:32.500 --> 21:34.610
scout the area with
burner phones.

21:34.810 --> 21:36.410
So we scanned the area around
the Serbian ambassador's house

21:36.610 --> 21:38.010
for burner phone activity,

21:38.210 --> 21:41.310
found five phone calls on burner
phones from this location.

21:41.510 --> 21:43.250
And checked the ambassador's
itinerary.

21:43.450 --> 21:45.050
He flies out to Serbia
tomorrow morning,

21:45.250 --> 21:46.950
so the hit's got to be tonight.

21:47.150 --> 21:50.290
Teamwork makes the dream work.
It's right up there.

21:50.490 --> 21:51.820
They're probably gonna hit
around the back

21:52.020 --> 21:53.630
near the bedrooms, 'cause
that's where the people are.

21:53.830 --> 21:56.230
I mean, this is, you know, this
is what I would do, so...

21:56.430 --> 21:58.660
All right. Let's go
visit the ambassador,

21:58.860 --> 22:01.570
tell him what's going on,
set up a perimeter...

22:01.770 --> 22:05.250
(tires screeching)
That truck-- is it...

22:07.990 --> 22:09.340
Truck doesn't have a driver.
It's the truck.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.980
It's happening now!
Go, go!

22:12.180 --> 22:13.860
* *

22:25.510 --> 22:27.740
* *

22:33.210 --> 22:35.000
GIB:
<i>A driverless truck? I mean,</i>

22:35.200 --> 22:36.830
these guys are into
some next-level stuff.

22:37.030 --> 22:38.300
It's pretty thrilling.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.940
I've never been up against
an auto-drive truck

22:40.140 --> 22:41.570
that detonates on impact.

22:41.770 --> 22:42.970
Detonates?
Oh, yeah.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.580
I will bet you one hoagie that
that thing

22:44.780 --> 22:45.780
is loaded with PETN.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.680
I mean,
it could be RDX

22:47.880 --> 22:49.110
but, given the application,
I'm sure

22:49.310 --> 22:51.180
they're going for
maximum boom.

22:51.380 --> 22:52.820
Harry. Uh, Gib here.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.990
Need you to run that truck
right off the road.

22:55.190 --> 22:56.690
But do not shoot the trailer

22:56.890 --> 22:58.160
or we'll be scraping you
off the pavement.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.890
HARRY:
<i>Comforting, Gib.</i>

23:00.090 --> 23:01.330
Luther, get alongside
that truck.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.950
Oh. The, uh, the one with
all the explosives? Sure.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.700
If we shoot out

23:06.900 --> 23:08.480
the tire, it should
veer into the trees.

23:18.090 --> 23:19.580
It's not working.
They're run-flats.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.010
GIB:
Harry, you're about

23:21.210 --> 23:22.410
two minutes away
from the ambassador's house.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.720
Whatever you're gonna
do, do it fast.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.270
Luther, get close.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.520
MARIA:
Harry, remember what Gib said

23:31.720 --> 23:34.490
about scraping you
off the pavement?
Yeah.

23:34.690 --> 23:36.480
It was comforting.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.150
Oh!
Oh, hey, Harry!

23:50.860 --> 23:52.330
Harry, bail out now!

24:09.580 --> 24:12.160
Nice work last night.
Good news? Nobody got hurt.

24:12.360 --> 24:16.530
And now for the bad news--
and there's a lot of bad news--

24:16.730 --> 24:19.570
the Serbian ambassador knows
that the boom was meant for him,

24:19.770 --> 24:22.210
and the Serbs aren't
taking it lying down.

24:22.410 --> 24:25.180
They launched missile strikes
this morning against Albania.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.380
In turn,
Albania is rolling tanks.

24:27.580 --> 24:29.510
So, tell them
they're being played.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.320
We did.
They want proof.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.450
And until we get it, the war
only gets worse. And if NATO

24:34.650 --> 24:38.020
and Russia get involved, we all
get to live in fallout shelters.

24:38.220 --> 24:40.260
What about the explosives
in the truck?

24:40.460 --> 24:43.090
That amount of PETN does
not just show up in D.C.

24:43.290 --> 24:44.560
Yeah. Forensics is on it.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.100
Guys, stay
frosty, okay?

24:46.300 --> 24:48.480
The minute we get
a lead, we go.

24:53.220 --> 24:56.160
I could really
go for a meatball sub.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.260
(gunshots)

25:01.460 --> 25:03.010
Harry!

25:03.210 --> 25:05.400
You get it out of your system?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.720
What do you mean?

25:08.920 --> 25:09.920
Come on, Harry.
Floor's got

25:10.120 --> 25:12.110
more brass on it
than a jazz band.

25:13.370 --> 25:14.860
Clearly, you have
an issue with the Wolf.

25:15.060 --> 25:17.030
What going on?
Okay, yes.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.530
Everybody thinks
this guy's a hero. When he sees

25:19.730 --> 25:22.070
death and destruction,
he gets the munchies.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.770
When someone says
something horrible,

25:23.970 --> 25:26.000
he says,
"That's what I would do."

25:26.200 --> 25:27.440
I'm just saying,
not a lot of things

25:27.640 --> 25:30.640
scare me, but this guy?
He scares me.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.880
And now he's training Helen.
Yes.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.380
And she thinks he's a great guy,

25:34.580 --> 25:36.450
and they're going to lunch
together all the time.

25:36.650 --> 25:38.150
She won't listen to me.

25:38.350 --> 25:39.520
You listening to her?

25:39.720 --> 25:41.090
What?

25:41.290 --> 25:44.160
Man, I love you, but you get
tunnel vision sometimes.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.360
Helen's going through a lot
of change right now.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.490
And maybe she needs a
little bit more attention,

25:48.690 --> 25:51.300
little bit more support,
than what you're giving her.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.600
And maybe that's what
she's getting from Wolf.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.700
So you're saying that I
should be okay with her

25:55.900 --> 25:57.900
hanging out with
a murderous psycho?
(door opens)

25:58.100 --> 26:00.920
Uh...

26:02.790 --> 26:04.440
WOLF:
Just want to let you know

26:04.640 --> 26:08.280
the PETN in that bomb was made
with a signature plasticizer.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.480
We traced it back to
a local chemical plant.

26:10.680 --> 26:14.170
Good news. Okay. I'm gonna
go check that out.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.020
Yeah, good.

26:17.220 --> 26:19.440
Gib's gonna go check that out.
That's good.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.330
Teamwork makes the dream work.

26:24.530 --> 26:25.980
Am I right?

26:32.120 --> 26:33.500
(door closes)

26:33.710 --> 26:37.120
So that's what bottomless
wells of darkness look like.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.740
* *

26:52.440 --> 26:53.910
(twig snaps)

27:02.480 --> 27:04.020
(leaves rustling)

27:24.870 --> 27:26.660
What are you thinking?

27:26.860 --> 27:28.560
I-I nearly shot you again.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.630
(chuckles)

27:30.830 --> 27:32.400
It's funny every time.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.730
Is there something you need?

27:33.930 --> 27:35.100
I had a great idea.

27:35.300 --> 27:38.020
I want Helen to join us
on the mission.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.000
What mission?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.610
The mission
to take out the assassins?

27:41.810 --> 27:43.470
Yeah. I shared some
Müller intel with her.

27:43.670 --> 27:45.210
She had incredible insight.

27:45.410 --> 27:48.180
Plus, she speaks German like
she's from the Deutschland.

27:48.380 --> 27:51.880
Okay. That's an interesting
idea, but, uh,

27:52.080 --> 27:53.790
Trilby wants Helen
to finish her training.

27:53.990 --> 27:56.920
I already spoke to Trilby.
She loves the idea.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.520
And then...

27:58.720 --> 28:01.190
I called Helen.

28:01.390 --> 28:02.990
And she is...

28:03.190 --> 28:04.950
very excited.

28:05.910 --> 28:08.280
You don't disagree, do you?

28:09.720 --> 28:10.900
No.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.070
I think it's a great idea.
She should come.

28:13.270 --> 28:14.710
Great.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.820
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.230
See you tomorrow.

28:23.870 --> 28:24.920
HELEN:
<i>And I translated</i>

28:25.120 --> 28:26.780
the analysis of these
war profiteers,

28:26.980 --> 28:29.490
I add a couple of notes,
and Nathan said

28:29.690 --> 28:31.090
I'm the best analyst
he's ever seen.

28:31.290 --> 28:33.420
And then he went to bat for me
with Trilby.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.760
It's nice to have a friend
who's pulling for me.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.030
Okay, okay, I'm sorry,
I have to say this.

28:38.230 --> 28:41.270
The Wolf isn't friend material.
Oh, this again, Harry?

28:41.470 --> 28:42.570
Come on.
I'll admit it--

28:42.770 --> 28:44.170
when I found out that Nathan
was an assassin,

28:44.370 --> 28:45.970
I had, you know,
a little "yikes" moment.

28:46.170 --> 28:48.240
But I wasn't that thrilled
when I found out what you do--

28:48.440 --> 28:51.440
shooting terrorists in Paris--
you know, it's morally complex.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.180
But I gave you
the benefit of the doubt

28:53.380 --> 28:54.880
because I know
you have a good heart.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.780
And I know that Nathan
has a good heart, too.

28:56.980 --> 28:59.680
Okay, listen.
The Wolf overheard me

28:59.880 --> 29:02.050
call him something
that I was saying to Gib,

29:02.250 --> 29:04.760
and it was not flattering.
But he gave me this look.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.020
And it was chilling.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.630
And then he stalked
me to my car.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.390
Well, what did you say
about him?

29:10.590 --> 29:12.560
I-I just...
I... It was...

29:12.760 --> 29:14.530
I called him a murderous
psycho or something.

29:14.730 --> 29:16.230
Oh, you called him
a murderous psycho

29:16.430 --> 29:18.600
and you wanted him to,
what, be happy?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.600
You don't get it.
He's dangerous.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.670
I looked into his eyes tonight,
honey, and there was nothing.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.540
Just bottomless
wells of darkness.

29:26.740 --> 29:30.350
Well, I looked into his eyes
too, and I saw some light.
Oh...

29:30.550 --> 29:34.520
Also, Trilby ordered me,
so, want me to defy an order?

29:34.720 --> 29:36.190
No. I-I just...

29:36.390 --> 29:40.020
I just want you to try and watch
him. Just try to see what I see.

29:40.220 --> 29:42.430
Fine.

29:42.630 --> 29:45.300
And can you just support me?

29:45.500 --> 29:47.110
And my friendship.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.950
Okay. Yeah.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.270
GIB:
<i>This is it, guys. We're rolling.</i>

29:54.470 --> 29:55.770
You got something
from the chemical plant

29:55.970 --> 29:57.210
that made the explosives?
Yep.

29:57.410 --> 29:59.210
I hacked their mainframe
and traced a purchase order

29:59.410 --> 30:00.780
to an Arlington warehouse.

30:00.980 --> 30:02.480
You think the assassins
are working out of a warehouse?

30:02.680 --> 30:04.120
Probably bugged out by now,

30:04.320 --> 30:05.980
but it's a good place to pick up
a trail, we could do some recon.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.050
Yeah, and the clock's ticking.
Trilby says

30:08.250 --> 30:11.260
Albania's launching
a full-scale invasion tonight.

30:11.460 --> 30:12.560
So, pound those coffees.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.560
Don't pound your coffee
too hard, Harry.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.280
Wouldn't want you to choke.
To death.

30:21.980 --> 30:23.600
All right, this place
looks abandoned,

30:23.800 --> 30:25.140
but let's do it right.

30:25.340 --> 30:27.270
If there's any signs of life
in there, I want to know.

30:27.470 --> 30:30.010
All right, Helen.
First time-- stay alert.

30:30.210 --> 30:33.810
Yeah. Gib? For the recon
that they're doing--

30:34.010 --> 30:35.450
they don't do
any shooting, right?

30:35.650 --> 30:37.210
No. Shouldn't be. Why?

30:37.410 --> 30:38.620
Just...

30:38.820 --> 30:41.170
That's good.
Nothing.

30:49.740 --> 30:51.730
HARRY:
Well, if the assassins
were here, looks like

30:51.930 --> 30:52.960
they're gone now.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.500
LUTHER:
East side clear.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.830
Okay.
Advance to north and south

30:57.030 --> 30:58.920
vantage points for confirmation.

31:01.490 --> 31:04.780
So, I am glad you
and Helen are friends.

31:04.980 --> 31:06.680
Oh, you didn't
sound glad last night.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.010
Yeah, about what you heard--

31:08.210 --> 31:09.410
some things sound bad
out of context.

31:09.610 --> 31:12.820
Is there a good context
to "murderous psychopath"?

31:13.020 --> 31:14.850
That was just, like,
a figure of speech.

31:15.050 --> 31:16.520
You can't take these
things seriously, man.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.760
I didn't survive this long
by not taking things seriously.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.510
Man.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.800
LUTHER: West side clear.
We are clear

31:32.000 --> 31:33.770
on the south side.

31:33.970 --> 31:35.140
GIB:
Got it.

31:35.340 --> 31:37.260
Sit tight. I'll let Omega
know you're moving in.

31:38.990 --> 31:40.910
Wait, no, Gib.

31:41.110 --> 31:42.350
I think you should
look at this.

31:42.550 --> 31:43.920
I'm going over all
the communications

31:44.120 --> 31:45.220
that you hacked from
the chemical plant

31:45.420 --> 31:46.880
where the explosives
came from,

31:47.080 --> 31:48.820
and something's weird.
Weird how?

31:49.020 --> 31:50.690
All of the employees
have American names,

31:50.890 --> 31:52.360
and all of the internal
memos and emails

31:52.560 --> 31:55.030
are written in English,
but I can tell

31:55.230 --> 31:57.160
from the grammar
and the word choices

31:57.360 --> 31:58.800
that it was written
by a German speaker.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.300
I'm pretty sure every single
one of these emails is fake.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.200
Hey, guys.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.100
Hold up a second,
something smells bad.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.940
Helen just figured out that
the chemical plant was a front.

32:08.140 --> 32:10.410
Whole thing might be a setup.
Stand by.

32:10.610 --> 32:12.140
A setup? How could
it be a setup?

32:12.340 --> 32:14.950
That truck nearly blew up
the Serbian ambassador.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.280
Müller knew we would
trace the explosives...

32:17.480 --> 32:19.080
whether he killed
the ambassador or not.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.890
One way or the other,
we were ending up here.

32:22.090 --> 32:23.990
So he creates a false
trail, lures us

32:24.190 --> 32:25.660
into his trap.
And kills the only people

32:25.860 --> 32:28.460
that can stop him from
starting a war. I mean, it...

32:28.660 --> 32:30.130
That's what you would do.

32:30.330 --> 32:31.910
Yeah.

32:49.230 --> 32:50.480
We should call for backup.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.480
No, if they see backup,
they're gonna bug out.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.450
We got one chance to surprise
them and it's right now.

32:54.650 --> 32:56.120
We don't have much time
to flip the script.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.690
Okay, well, look, th-they're
gonna be expecting us

32:58.890 --> 33:00.020
through that
eastern loading bay.

33:00.220 --> 33:02.230
It's got the best sight lines.
We can use that.

33:02.430 --> 33:04.830
GIB:
Yeah, I don't know, guys.
There's a lot of unknowns here.

33:05.030 --> 33:07.060
We don't know how many
assassins are inside.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.750
I mean, we need
a massive misdirection.

33:10.750 --> 33:14.010
Gib, how attached are you
to that tac van?

33:14.210 --> 33:15.970
Come on, Harry!

33:16.170 --> 33:18.780
I like this one.
I just got her all set up.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.160
("Let's Go!" by Space Camp
playing)

33:24.570 --> 33:26.120
* Come on, now, ready,
let's go *

33:26.320 --> 33:27.920
* Come on, ready, let's go *

33:28.120 --> 33:30.390
* We turn it up
until the roof is shaking *

33:30.590 --> 33:32.990
* We 'bout to put on a show *

33:33.190 --> 33:34.830
* We 'bout
to put on a show *

33:35.030 --> 33:38.150
* You know we're all about
them good vibrations. *

33:39.610 --> 33:41.600
It's been a great run,
little mama.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.530
Neither one of us thought it
would end like this, but...

33:43.730 --> 33:45.040
Gib.
it's for the greater good.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.110
There's-there's gonna be
shooting now, right? Obviously?

33:48.310 --> 33:49.940
Yeah.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.240
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.580
I just need to do one thing.
Nathan.

33:53.780 --> 33:55.180
Yeah?
Hi.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.280
I just wanted to say something
to you before you left.

33:57.480 --> 33:58.720
Oh. Okay.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.450
I know you said
you weren't sure about the seed.

34:01.650 --> 34:02.520
Uh-huh.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.490
I just wanted to say I'm sure.

34:04.690 --> 34:07.490
And, um, I know
you have a good heart.

34:07.690 --> 34:11.680
And I hope that
you remember that today.

34:13.850 --> 34:15.150
Okay.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.300
Okay.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.090
HARRY:
All right, let's get the van
into position.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.030
* *

34:42.180 --> 34:44.810
(shouting in German)

35:11.710 --> 35:13.990
(shouting in German)

35:14.190 --> 35:15.840
(steam hissing)

35:26.450 --> 35:27.900
* Hey, you *

35:28.100 --> 35:29.740
* Think you need me *

35:29.940 --> 35:31.580
* From what you *

35:31.780 --> 35:33.280
* Saw on TV *

35:33.480 --> 35:35.010
* Think twice *

35:35.210 --> 35:37.610
* But I won't let you
be my own demise... *

35:37.810 --> 35:39.930
Harry! Together? Go!

35:45.310 --> 35:48.090
* I won't let you
be my own demise... *

35:48.290 --> 35:50.210
Go!

35:53.180 --> 35:54.200
Müller's running!

35:54.400 --> 35:56.330
Go after him, Harry,
we got this.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.270
* I'm a nuisance *

35:58.470 --> 35:59.840
* I'm a danger *

36:00.040 --> 36:01.970
* You're a liar... *

36:02.170 --> 36:03.340
Cover us!

36:03.540 --> 36:05.540
* Saw on TV *

36:05.740 --> 36:06.610
* Think twice *

36:06.810 --> 36:08.210
* Don't deceive me *

36:08.410 --> 36:11.780
* But I won't let you
be my own demise, hey... *

36:11.980 --> 36:13.250
Do we think they're okay?

36:13.450 --> 36:15.550
I don't know if they're okay,
but they're still alive.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.050
You can check their vitals
right here. See?

36:17.250 --> 36:20.210
Uh-huh.
58 beats per minute?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.360
Wolf really
doesn't mind killing.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.650
No, he does not.

36:27.110 --> 36:29.850
Okay.
All right, he could be anywhere.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.670
Okay.

36:32.870 --> 36:35.340
You go in front.
I'll cover you from behind.

36:35.540 --> 36:36.440
From behind?
Yeah.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.610
You mean, like, behind my head?

36:37.810 --> 36:39.010
Yeah.
I do it all the time. Go.

36:39.210 --> 36:41.510
Okay, uh, just
thinking out loud here.

36:41.710 --> 36:43.410
Uh, we should stick together.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.650
What? I can-I can hit a target
from a thousand yards

36:45.850 --> 36:47.880
with this thing.
That's right, but
I'm just gonna say this

36:48.080 --> 36:50.450
out loud. Uh, you shoot people
in the back of the head.

36:50.650 --> 36:51.860
It's kind of your thing.

36:52.060 --> 36:55.130
Harry. Do you think
I'm gonna kill you?

36:55.330 --> 36:57.140
Maybe.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.430
Did I think about it?
Yeah.

37:00.630 --> 37:01.970
But then Helen said this

37:02.170 --> 37:03.970
really nice thing about seeds
and then I was like,

37:04.170 --> 37:06.600
"Oh, whatever, never mind,
I'm not gonna do it."

37:06.800 --> 37:07.940
Seeds?
Yeah.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.060
You're a very lucky man.
Now let's do this.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.680
Besides,

37:14.880 --> 37:16.350
if I wanted to kill you,
you'd never see it coming.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.770
(chuckles, exhales)

37:31.780 --> 37:33.460
(quietly): Pew! Pew!

37:33.660 --> 37:35.380
(chuckles)

37:50.730 --> 37:53.130
(clicks)

37:53.970 --> 37:57.700
Hey, Wolf?
Uh, could use a little help.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.510
Uh... Nathan?

38:03.340 --> 38:05.200
Wolf. Nathan.
Where are you?

38:05.400 --> 38:07.100
Why isn't
Nathan answering?
HARRY: Nathan!

38:07.300 --> 38:08.280
Wolf!

38:13.020 --> 38:16.120
Nice tricks. But now
it's time to die.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.190
(gunshot)

38:21.860 --> 38:23.710
Sorry I was late.
I walked around to try

38:23.910 --> 38:25.320
to get a cleaner shot.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.220
Oh, okay.
Yeah, no problem.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.250
It was pretty intense, huh?
Hey, you okay?

38:30.450 --> 38:32.870
Oh, yeah.
(grunts)

38:33.940 --> 38:35.660
You feel like a grilled cheese?

38:35.860 --> 38:37.590
Huh?

38:37.790 --> 38:40.330
TRILBY:
Nice job. You stopped a war

38:40.530 --> 38:43.100
and took a dangerous outfit
off the board.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.570
Mission complete.

38:44.770 --> 38:47.290
(clears throat)
Uh, oh, yeah.

38:48.090 --> 38:49.940
Someone pointed out that
if it hadn't been for Helen,

38:50.140 --> 38:52.080
you would have all been
rocketed to kingdom come.

38:52.280 --> 38:56.050
That same person suggested
that Helen was now ready to be

38:56.250 --> 38:58.420
promoted to full-time agent.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.320
(chuckles): What?

39:00.520 --> 39:01.920
Full agent?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.200
Who?

39:03.970 --> 39:05.660
You're probably one
of the most overqualified

39:05.860 --> 39:07.660
trainees Omega's ever had.

39:07.860 --> 39:08.990
You're more than ready.
TRILBY: I mean,

39:09.190 --> 39:10.430
I was a Rhodes Scholar,

39:10.630 --> 39:12.260
black belt in jiujitsu,

39:12.460 --> 39:13.760
but who's keeping score?

39:13.960 --> 39:16.830
Wait, is this real?

39:17.030 --> 39:19.570
Yes, Helen.
I approved it personally.

39:19.770 --> 39:22.310
So, yes. Congrats.

39:22.510 --> 39:26.280
Thank you so much.
I will not let you down.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.760
Just don't think
you're gonna get an office.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.990
Congratulations, Helen.

39:37.190 --> 39:39.860
Sadly, for me
it's time to adios.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.830
But I got you all

39:42.030 --> 39:44.090
little things to remember me by.

39:44.290 --> 39:46.530
This is a leather conditioner.
You should use that

39:46.730 --> 39:47.830
on your bag.
It's amazing.

39:48.030 --> 39:49.730
I will use it every day.

39:49.930 --> 39:51.740
I know.

39:51.940 --> 39:53.000
Maria,

39:53.200 --> 39:54.710
this is to make your draw

39:54.910 --> 39:56.110
even quicker.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.830
That's a really nice holster.
Thanks, man.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.050
What do we got?

40:02.250 --> 40:03.630
I'm proud of this one.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.880
A signed copy of the code for
the Aughtnet computer virus?

40:08.080 --> 40:09.120
(chuckles) Oh!

40:09.320 --> 40:10.690
I got his signature
right before the...

40:10.890 --> 40:13.960
(imitates cutting, spurting)

40:14.160 --> 40:16.040
We know it's his last signature.

40:19.510 --> 40:22.150
I-I made this for you.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.040
A friendship bracelet.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.890
'Cause we're friends.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.370
I love it so much, Nathan.

40:30.570 --> 40:32.230
Thank you.

40:33.760 --> 40:36.350
And I got this for you.
It's a light-up key chain.

40:36.550 --> 40:40.130
'Cause I know you get
skittish in the-in the dark.

40:41.430 --> 40:44.460
Oh... thanks.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.440
Bring it in, bud.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.580
HARRY:
Yeah.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.630
Congrats again, honey.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.520
Thanks for pulling for me.

41:00.350 --> 41:02.010
(sighs)
Yeah, about that.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.070
Gib mentioned something
the other day about

41:04.270 --> 41:06.310
how the Wolf was giving you
something that I wasn't.

41:06.510 --> 41:08.380
He made you
feel included.

41:08.580 --> 41:11.980
All I know is that Nathan
made me feel like

41:12.180 --> 41:13.750
I was part of the team.

41:13.950 --> 41:16.090
And that felt nice.

41:16.290 --> 41:18.760
Yeah, I get it.
I just wanted to say

41:18.960 --> 41:21.730
I'm sorry
for not seeing it earlier.

41:21.930 --> 41:23.480
Thank you for saying that.

41:25.410 --> 41:27.460
You know...

41:27.660 --> 41:30.270
the kids aren't getting
back until tomorrow.

41:30.470 --> 41:34.710
Mm-hmm.
And if you want me to, I can
show you how sorry I am.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.670
Oh. I might be open to that.

41:36.870 --> 41:37.940
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:38.140 --> 41:39.390
(phone dings)

41:46.030 --> 41:49.150
Is he eating a
gyro outside of

41:49.350 --> 41:50.820
a burning building?
Yep.

41:51.020 --> 41:52.560
Mm-kay.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.390
He... might be

41:55.590 --> 41:57.030
a little extra

41:57.230 --> 41:59.450
