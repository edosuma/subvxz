What do you want with me?

00:53.452 --> 00:55.369
Seriously?

00:55.371 --> 00:57.237
You've been hunting us
for weeks.

00:57.239 --> 00:58.789
On whose orders?

01:01.210 --> 01:02.960
Michael Noshimuri.

01:06.614 --> 01:08.248
So, what, you're, uh,

01:08.250 --> 01:09.917
you're just avenging his death,
is that it?

01:09.919 --> 01:11.668
Yes.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.086
Yeah?

01:14.472 --> 01:17.224
I know everyone
who worked for my brother.

01:17.226 --> 01:20.260
Nice try.

01:20.262 --> 01:22.796
This isn't about revenge.

01:22.798 --> 01:24.464
The clan you represent has

01:24.466 --> 01:26.850
nothing to do with my family.

01:26.852 --> 01:29.970
So why is there
a price on my head?

01:42.033 --> 01:43.667
What did he say?

01:43.669 --> 01:45.736
I said,

01:45.738 --> 01:47.821
my friends are gonna
have fun with you

01:47.823 --> 01:50.257
before they cut you
into little pieces.

01:50.259 --> 01:51.102
You shut your mouth.

01:51.127 --> 01:52.767
And we're gonna make
your boyfriend watch.

01:53.178 --> 01:56.713
Shut your mouth!

01:56.715 --> 01:59.883
Kill me and you'll never
find out who wants you dead.

01:59.885 --> 02:02.035
Good point.

02:10.311 --> 02:12.062
I got five more bullets.

02:12.064 --> 02:13.713
Now tell me
who sanctioned the hit!

02:13.715 --> 02:14.865
The Oyabun.

02:14.867 --> 02:17.150
Who is he?!

02:17.152 --> 02:19.603
Adam. Adam!

02:23.741 --> 02:25.492
This is not the way, okay?

02:25.494 --> 02:27.160
It's the only way.

02:27.162 --> 02:30.397
Kono, this guy knows the Yakuza
will kill him if he talks to us.

02:30.399 --> 02:32.866
He needs to know
we'll do the same

02:32.868 --> 02:35.952
if he doesn't answer
our questions.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.767
Please, help me.

04:14.635 --> 04:16.987
Can you help me get out?

04:16.988 --> 04:18.471
Can you help me?

04:24.145 --> 04:25.678
No!

04:25.680 --> 04:26.947
No, no!

Cheers, ladies.

To the future

05:31.746 --> 05:35.565
Mrs. Nathan Cotchin.

05:35.567 --> 05:36.716
To our good friend Nate,

05:36.718 --> 05:39.186
who at the age of 25
has decided he's cool

05:39.188 --> 05:41.104
with having sex with one woman

05:41.106 --> 05:43.857
for the rest of his life.

05:43.859 --> 05:45.292
Thanks for making us
look bad to our girlfriends.

06:36.327 --> 06:39.779
Ooh!

06:39.781 --> 06:41.665
If I forget to tell you later,

06:41.667 --> 06:43.667
I had a really good time
tonight.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.670
This is where we first met.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.438
You were 16,

06:48.440 --> 06:51.641
standing right over there
in a red and white sundress.

06:51.643 --> 06:52.992
You looked over and smiled

06:52.994 --> 06:55.345
and I knew I had to find out
who you were.

06:55.347 --> 06:56.848
I remember seeing you...

06:56.849 --> 06:58.115
What just happened?

06:58.117 --> 07:00.067
What do you mean?

07:00.069 --> 07:01.134
What, did I miss something?

07:01.136 --> 07:03.153
I mean, the music
just went all sad.

07:03.155 --> 07:05.038
That's because that's how the
filmmakers want you to feel.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.957
Sad. See?

07:06.959 --> 07:09.910
Well, no, this is supposed
to be a romantic comedy.

07:09.912 --> 07:11.245
This is neither
romantic nor funny.

07:11.247 --> 07:13.247
I don't understand what's happening.
I got it.

07:13.249 --> 07:16.466
Okay, this is what
they call the third act.

07:16.468 --> 07:18.468
They-they got
to come up with

07:18.470 --> 07:21.471
some goofy obstacle so that when
they get back together at the end,

07:21.473 --> 07:25.225
so get to feel all,
uh, warm and fuzzy.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.494
Yeah, you know,

07:27.496 --> 07:28.979
can you guys just save
the running commentary

07:28.981 --> 07:30.480
for the DVD release?

07:30.482 --> 07:32.399
Yes. All right.
Okay.

07:32.401 --> 07:34.601
Quiet.

07:38.456 --> 07:39.523
Now,

07:39.525 --> 07:40.257
watch this.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.243
Are you ready?

07:43.245 --> 07:45.812
Montage fades out and...

07:45.814 --> 07:49.683
Sam, I thought
you were never coming back.

07:49.685 --> 07:51.935
Well, you thought wrong.

07:51.937 --> 07:54.938
I have an 11-year old daughter.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.456
So I'm very hip to this

07:56.458 --> 07:59.793
specific genre of cinema.

08:00.795 --> 08:02.796
This is
the most unrealistic movie

08:02.798 --> 08:04.598
I've ever seen in my life.

08:05.684 --> 08:07.517
Stop talking!

08:07.519 --> 08:09.603
I'm sorry, man.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.940
Oh, come on.
Turn off the phone.

08:12.942 --> 08:15.208
Are you serious?
Are you serious?

08:15.210 --> 08:17.527
McGarrett.

08:17.529 --> 08:19.947
I'd ask you to tell me how the
movie ends, but I already know.

08:19.949 --> 08:21.898
Uh-huh. No, yeah.
We're on the way.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.116
No problem.

08:23.118 --> 08:24.451
Bye.

08:24.453 --> 08:26.353
Sorry.

08:26.355 --> 08:28.622
Finally! These guys suck.

08:40.452 --> 08:41.751
The C.O.D.

08:41.754 --> 08:44.371
was three close-range GSWs
to the chest.

08:44.373 --> 08:47.407
Lacerations and defensive wounds
on his hands

08:47.409 --> 08:48.842
indicate that the victim...

08:48.844 --> 08:50.210
Put up a good fight
before he was shot dead.

08:50.212 --> 08:52.346
Yes, thank you for completing

08:52.348 --> 08:54.231
my exact thought,
Commander McGarrett.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.715
The guy's name
is John Fitzpatrick.

08:55.717 --> 08:57.150
He's from Saint Petersburg,
Florida.

08:57.152 --> 08:58.235
He checked in yesterday.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.053
What's with
the penguin suit?

09:00.055 --> 09:02.105
There was a big black tie
wedding here tonight.

09:02.107 --> 09:03.740
Some wealthy family
from New York

09:03.742 --> 09:04.724
booked out half the resort.

09:04.726 --> 09:06.109
I'm thinking
he was a guest.

09:06.111 --> 09:07.244
Weddings, I tell you,
every time.

09:07.246 --> 09:08.228
It's a bad idea.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.563
You got dysfunctional
family members.

09:10.565 --> 09:11.665
Bunch of bitter friends.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.918
And they're all fueled
by an open bar.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.403
Something terrible
is bound to happen.

09:16.405 --> 09:18.071
And you wonder why
you're divorced.

09:18.073 --> 09:19.739
Okay, you know I'm right.

09:19.741 --> 09:21.458
This guy and another guy,
they get into a beef

09:21.460 --> 09:22.876
over, uh, I don't know,

09:22.878 --> 09:24.211
let's say a broad
at the reception.

09:24.213 --> 09:26.746
They end up back
in the room here, uh,

09:26.748 --> 09:29.416
get into a little fisticuffs.

09:30.284 --> 09:31.601
Uh, this guy doesn't realize

09:31.603 --> 09:32.969
his buddy has a gun--
bang, here he is.

09:32.971 --> 09:33.642
Interesting.

09:33.643 --> 09:35.142
Very detailed theory.

09:35.144 --> 09:36.644
I particularly enjoyed
your use

09:36.646 --> 09:38.062
of the word "fisticuffs""
Thank you.

09:38.064 --> 09:39.212
But according to the GM,

09:39.214 --> 09:40.931
the bride bailed on
the wedding mid-ceremony.

09:40.933 --> 09:42.299
Reception never
even happened.

09:42.301 --> 09:45.185
Ah, well, at least we're dealing
with a smart woman.

09:45.187 --> 09:46.353
All right, Chin.

09:46.355 --> 09:47.554
Uh, call Saint Petersburg PD.

09:47.556 --> 09:48.956
See if they can tell us anything
about the victim.

09:48.958 --> 09:50.774
You and I, let's go talk
to the wedding party.

09:50.776 --> 09:52.359
See if they know anything
about Fitzpatrick.

09:52.361 --> 09:53.560
Okay.

09:53.562 --> 09:55.746
Excuse me, Mrs. Cotchin?

09:55.748 --> 09:57.081
Steve McGarrett, Five-O.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.899
This is Detective Danny
Williams, my partner. - Hi.

09:58.901 --> 10:01.234
Thank you so much for coming.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.288
Allen? Police.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.340
Allen Kingston,
I'm Mrs. Cotchin's attorney.

10:06.342 --> 10:08.609
I-I spoke with
Sergeant Lukela.

10:08.611 --> 10:10.177
He assured us
the police would do

10:10.179 --> 10:12.596
everything they could
to help find Dahlia.

10:12.598 --> 10:14.581
Yes, ma'am, and I'm sure
that's the case,

10:14.583 --> 10:16.633
but we're not here about
the, uh, the missing bride.

10:16.635 --> 10:19.887
We're actually here about the
murder of one John Fitzpatrick.

10:21.756 --> 10:24.675
I'm sorry, am I supposed
to know who that is?

10:24.677 --> 10:26.426
He found him, uh,
in a hotel room

10:26.428 --> 10:27.528
wearing a tuxedo

10:27.530 --> 10:29.196
and he had
your wedding program.

10:29.198 --> 10:31.398
Well, that may be,

10:31.400 --> 10:32.733
but he was not invited.

10:32.735 --> 10:34.401
I oversaw the guest list myself.

10:34.403 --> 10:35.936
Okay, you're saying he was
a wedding crasher?

10:35.938 --> 10:38.122
Nathan Cotchin is heir

10:38.124 --> 10:40.040
to one of the largest real
estate fortunes in New York.

10:40.042 --> 10:42.576
Ever since news of
the engagement broke,

10:42.578 --> 10:45.162
the tabloids have been
hounding him and Dahlia.

10:45.164 --> 10:47.815
They've had paparazzi camped
outside their building for weeks.

10:47.817 --> 10:50.384
Okay, well, the victim's room
was searched.

10:50.386 --> 10:52.052
Uh, there was
no camera equipment.

10:52.054 --> 10:53.854
So it's highly unlikely
that he was a paparazzi.

10:53.856 --> 10:57.725
Whoever he was, I am terribly
sorry he lost his life.

10:57.727 --> 11:00.994
But my future daughter-in-law
is missing.

11:00.996 --> 11:03.647
With all due respect,
Mrs. Cotchin,

11:03.649 --> 11:04.965
my guess is
that's no coincidence.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.800
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Wait a mine.

11:06.802 --> 11:08.602
Are you implying
that Dahlia is a suspect?

11:08.604 --> 11:11.772
No. I mean, you know, for all
we know, she could be a target.

11:11.774 --> 11:12.990
We're just saying
that her running

11:12.992 --> 11:14.792
might not be a case
of cold feet.

11:14.794 --> 11:15.993
Excuse me.

11:15.995 --> 11:18.829
Chin, what do you got?

11:18.831 --> 11:21.582
So I got this footage
from the videographer.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.784
And it looks like
the wedding's going off

11:23.786 --> 11:26.787
without a hitch, right?
Until right here.

11:27.672 --> 11:29.740
Check out the expression
on Dahlia's face.

11:29.742 --> 11:32.242
Something scared her.

11:32.244 --> 11:34.528
She's looking over that way.
Can you zoom in?

11:39.100 --> 11:41.718
Well, it looks like everyone's
smiling except this guy.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.353
That's our victim.

11:44.889 --> 11:46.890
Fitzpatrick was at the ceremony.

11:46.892 --> 11:49.343
He's the reason
the bride took off.

11:59.482 --> 12:00.816
No, I-I don't get it.

12:00.818 --> 12:02.935
This guy crashed my wedding
and now he's dead?

12:03.337 --> 12:05.020
Who was he?

12:05.022 --> 12:06.671
John Fitzpatrick, from Florida.

12:06.673 --> 12:08.890
Dahlia never
mentioned this guy?

12:08.892 --> 12:11.109
No. Why?

12:11.111 --> 12:13.812
Because he's the
reason she ran.

12:13.814 --> 12:16.181
I knew there had
to be an explanation.

12:16.183 --> 12:18.433
All day, she was so happy
and confident.

12:18.435 --> 12:20.986
All that changed when
she saw this guy.

12:20.988 --> 12:24.722
Now, could he be an
ex-boyfriend of hers,

12:24.724 --> 12:26.241
somebody from her past?

12:26.243 --> 12:29.560
I know all her friends,
and she has very little family.

12:29.562 --> 12:31.062
We don't keep secrets.

12:31.064 --> 12:32.497
Well, respectfully,
Nathan,

12:32.499 --> 12:34.749
your fiancée just ran out
of her own wedding ceremony

12:34.751 --> 12:36.117
to get away from
this person.

12:36.119 --> 12:38.003
So, I mean, whatever
her connection is with him,

12:38.005 --> 12:39.904
she's been hiding
it from you.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.593
If this man is dead,
then where is Dahlia?

12:48.714 --> 12:50.198
<i>So why did Fitzpatrick</i>

12:50.200 --> 12:51.599
crash this wedding?

12:51.601 --> 12:54.803
I don't know. My money's
on him being a jealous ex.

12:54.805 --> 12:57.305
Weddings tend to bring them out
in droves, you know?

12:58.140 --> 13:01.559
You ever talk
to anybody about this?

13:01.561 --> 13:03.278
About what?

13:03.280 --> 13:05.230
About your issues with weddings,
they're deep-seated.

13:05.232 --> 13:07.582
I'm just saying that you should
maybe workshop them.

13:07.584 --> 13:08.984
No, I'm-I'm literally speaking
from experience.

13:08.986 --> 13:10.869
I got two cousins,
two of my cousins had

13:10.871 --> 13:12.320
their weddings busted up
by jealous exes.

13:12.322 --> 13:14.439
Okay, so you think Fitzpatrick
came to break up the wedding,

13:14.441 --> 13:17.876
and Dahlia, what, lost her mind
and then killed him?

13:17.878 --> 13:21.296
I don't know. I mean, she is our
only natural suspect,

13:21.298 --> 13:22.547
but TOD does not match up.

13:22.549 --> 13:24.615
The valet guy said
that she beelined for her car.

13:24.617 --> 13:27.452
Yeah, not to mention she's
a hundred pounds soaking wet.

13:27.454 --> 13:28.887
There's no way she could
inflict those defensive wounds

13:28.889 --> 13:30.638
that we saw
on that guy.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.140
Monkey, what's going on?

13:32.142 --> 13:34.009
You good?

13:34.011 --> 13:35.960
Yeah. Gabby makes better
pancakes than you.

13:35.962 --> 13:37.812
Really? That's-that's

13:37.814 --> 13:40.615
what you called, to make that
point to me now, ruin my day?

13:40.617 --> 13:41.733
Seriously.
It's not even close.

13:41.735 --> 13:42.851
She needs to teach you how

13:42.853 --> 13:44.135
to make 'em all gooey
in the middle.

13:44.137 --> 13:45.387
Oh, okay. Well, then

13:45.389 --> 13:47.638
why don't you put
the master chef on the phone?

13:47.640 --> 13:48.807
I'll get her recipe, huh?

13:48.809 --> 13:50.141
Okay. Love you, Danno.

13:50.143 --> 13:51.943
Love you, too.

13:51.945 --> 13:54.812
Okay, I swear I did not
put her up to that.

13:54.814 --> 13:57.332
Have I told you
how fantastic you are?

13:57.334 --> 13:59.584
Um, not in the last 12 hours.

13:59.586 --> 14:01.652
Hey, if you are gonna be late
at work tonight,

14:01.654 --> 14:02.837
that's totally fine

14:02.839 --> 14:07.892
because we have an entire
mani-pedi night planned.

14:07.894 --> 14:10.128
You got a mani-ped...?
Listen, do me a favor.

14:10.130 --> 14:11.679
You are not allowed to top

14:11.681 --> 14:12.931
my daddy-daughter
spa nights, please.

14:12.933 --> 14:15.133
No, no, this is
just gonna be mediocre...

14:15.135 --> 14:16.384
unlike my pancakes.

14:18.654 --> 14:21.689
Hey, um...

14:21.691 --> 14:24.609
so I kind of hate
to bring this up again,

14:24.611 --> 14:28.313
but they're really pressing me
for an answer.

14:28.315 --> 14:31.866
So... have you given any more
thought to what we discussed?

14:31.868 --> 14:35.186
Uh, yes, of course I have,
and I do want to talk about it,

14:35.188 --> 14:39.190
but Steve and I just pulled up
to a crime scene, so, um...

14:39.192 --> 14:41.659
Okay, um, yeah, no problem.
We'll chat about it when

14:41.661 --> 14:43.044
when you get home. Okay.
Okay.

14:43.046 --> 14:45.130
We just pulled up

14:45.132 --> 14:46.297
to a crime scene?

14:46.299 --> 14:48.817
Keep driving.
We'll find one, okay?

14:48.819 --> 14:50.502
Okay.

14:54.857 --> 14:57.409
Any news of our runaway bride?

14:57.411 --> 14:58.927
No, still MIA.
Airports are on alert

14:58.929 --> 15:00.945
and I got units
searching the island.

15:00.947 --> 15:03.014
I did hear back
from the Saint Petersburg PD

15:03.016 --> 15:04.165
about our victim, though.

15:04.167 --> 15:07.519
According to them,
John Fitzpatrick doesn't exist.

15:09.155 --> 15:10.888
Driver's license was a fake

15:10.890 --> 15:13.842
along with the credit card he
used to register at the hotel.

15:13.844 --> 15:14.976
Okay, so we got

15:14.978 --> 15:17.061
a guy who flies to Hawaii
under an alias,

15:17.063 --> 15:18.113
crashes a wedding,

15:18.115 --> 15:20.115
and then ends up shot
dead, is that right?

15:20.117 --> 15:22.333
Pretty much.
I ran his prints through IAFIS

15:22.335 --> 15:23.435
and didn't get a hit.

15:23.437 --> 15:25.703
But I did hear back
on the murder weapon.

15:25.705 --> 15:28.206
Ballistics came back to
a Ruger .9mm recently used

15:28.208 --> 15:30.425
in a string of armed robberies.
No arrests yet,

15:30.427 --> 15:32.577
but HPD is circling a suspect.

15:32.579 --> 15:35.230
Meet Ty Amano, 22 years old.

15:35.232 --> 15:37.682
Been in and out of juvie
for drug possession.

15:37.684 --> 15:41.252
Looks like he graduated
to armed robbery.

15:41.254 --> 15:42.854
And now possibly murder.

16:05.896 --> 16:07.729
Side out, bitches!

16:13.235 --> 16:15.019
Ty!

16:15.021 --> 16:15.720
Time to sub out.

16:15.722 --> 16:17.338
<i>I already told you,</i>

16:17.340 --> 16:20.225
I don't own a gun, and
I definitely don't know nothing

16:20.227 --> 16:21.759
about no dead guy at a wedding.

16:21.761 --> 16:25.897
I was getting tacos up
in Waimanalo last night.

16:25.899 --> 16:27.398
Really? I'll bet
you got witnesses

16:27.400 --> 16:30.068
to corroborate that alibi,
too, huh?

16:30.070 --> 16:32.937
Your dealer,
a buyer maybe?

16:32.939 --> 16:34.972
Or wait a minute.
Maybe you're with the guys

16:34.974 --> 16:37.242
you've been pulling off the
armed robberies with, huh?

16:37.244 --> 16:38.476
I ain't no robber.

16:38.478 --> 16:40.161
Okay. Well,
that's fine.

16:40.163 --> 16:41.446
Then you won't mind if HPD goes

16:41.448 --> 16:43.748
and searches your apartment
right now, yeah?

16:43.750 --> 16:46.201
Just to make sure there's
no stolen goods, right?

16:46.203 --> 16:48.169
All right, all right, man.
Okay, so here's the deal:

16:48.171 --> 16:49.987
I might have some stuff
back at my place,

16:49.989 --> 16:51.606
but I'm just holding it
for a friend.

16:51.608 --> 16:52.840
Oh, okay.

16:52.842 --> 16:54.542
I swear I got nothing on

16:54.544 --> 16:56.444
this dead guy!
I got rid

16:56.446 --> 16:57.828
of that gun two days ago.

16:57.830 --> 16:59.497
What, you dumped it?

16:59.499 --> 17:00.381
Hell no.

17:00.383 --> 17:02.500
The piece is worth
500 bucks.

17:02.502 --> 17:03.834
Old dawn patrol buddy asked me

17:03.836 --> 17:06.503
to hook his boy up with some
heat, so I did him a solid.

17:06.506 --> 17:08.522
Nice solid, unloading a hot gun,
you idiot.

17:08.525 --> 17:09.741
Who'd you sell it to?

17:09.742 --> 17:11.442
Let me go check
the sales receipt.

17:11.444 --> 17:13.528
Hey, you want to be a smart-ass, huh?
I don't freaking know!

17:13.530 --> 17:15.029
Buyer didn't give me a name.

17:15.031 --> 17:18.199
Haole, brown hair,
medium height.

17:24.373 --> 17:26.357
He look like this guy?

17:27.326 --> 17:29.026
Yeah, that's him.

17:30.079 --> 17:32.196
Oh, man.

17:32.198 --> 17:33.965
He's your dead dude?

17:33.967 --> 17:36.251
Yeah, he was killed with the gun
you sold him.

17:36.253 --> 17:37.669
What else do you know about him?

17:37.671 --> 17:40.805
Nothing. My buddy just said
he was a friend.

17:40.807 --> 17:43.091
Someone he knew
growing up in Germany.

17:43.093 --> 17:44.509
This guy was German?

17:44.511 --> 17:45.476
Didn't talk German.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.062
Sounded pretty American to me.

17:49.548 --> 17:52.216
Turns out John Fitzpatrick
is actually Brad Dixon.

17:52.218 --> 17:54.435
He's a U.S. citizen convicted

17:54.437 --> 17:56.571
of running confidence scams
all throughout the EU.

17:56.573 --> 17:58.222
In fact, he was just released

17:58.224 --> 17:59.757
from a Munich prison
six weeks ago.

17:59.759 --> 18:01.225
The Cotchins had deep pockets.

18:01.227 --> 18:03.027
Guess this guy was
targeting them.

18:03.029 --> 18:05.196
Yeah, and it gets better.
According to the report,

18:05.198 --> 18:07.064
Dixon's game was actually
running sweetheart scams

18:07.066 --> 18:08.266
against rich bachelors

18:08.268 --> 18:10.168
using female accomplices
as bait.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.920
Okay, who was the accomplice?

18:12.922 --> 18:15.840
His sister, Nicole Dixon.

18:17.593 --> 18:20.261
But you know her as...

18:20.263 --> 18:22.163
Dahlia Swain.

18:22.165 --> 18:26.551
AKA our runaway bride.

18:31.742 --> 18:35.275
So German police arrested Brad
and Nicole Dixon back in 2008.

18:35.276 --> 18:36.826
They were convicted
on multiple counts

18:36.828 --> 18:38.277
of embezzlement
and extortion.

18:38.279 --> 18:41.664
Now, Brad served
five years in prison, but Nicole

18:41.666 --> 18:42.915
got out after six months.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.083
Well, she must have

18:44.085 --> 18:45.951
testified against him
to get a reduced sentence.

18:45.953 --> 18:47.286
So she rolls on
her brother,

18:47.288 --> 18:50.473
she moves to New York, changes
her name to Dahlia Swain,

18:50.475 --> 18:52.341
finds a new mark,
the Cotchin kid,

18:52.343 --> 18:54.744
and dupes him into marrying her.

18:54.746 --> 18:56.095
Meanwhile, Brad gets
out of prison,

18:56.097 --> 18:58.631
finds out that his kid sister
is about to cash in,

18:58.633 --> 19:00.900
crashes the wedding to make
sure he gets his cut.

19:00.902 --> 19:02.568
It's got to be about more
than just money.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.220
I mean, check it out.
How would you feel

19:04.222 --> 19:06.272
if your sister rolled on you
the way she did him?

19:06.274 --> 19:07.657
I'd want to kill her.
Fair point.

19:07.659 --> 19:09.859
So he gets a gun for revenge.

19:09.861 --> 19:11.644
Dahlia realizes that
she can't buy his silence.

19:11.646 --> 19:13.079
So that explains why she ran.

19:13.081 --> 19:15.531
Well, it's a good thing she ran,
for the Cotchins, anyway,

19:15.533 --> 19:17.500
because if this guy doesn't co ,

19:17.502 --> 19:19.568
they are out a lot of money.

19:19.570 --> 19:21.671
Yeah, somehow, I don't think
the groom is gonna see

19:21.673 --> 19:23.973
that silver lining
when we break the news to him.

19:25.659 --> 19:27.159
<i>Well, this goes to show you</i>

19:27.161 --> 19:30.930
why people should never, under
any circumstances, get married.

19:30.932 --> 19:32.932
Why? In case you marry
a con artist

19:32.934 --> 19:34.233
who's after all your money?

19:34.235 --> 19:36.769
No, Steve.

19:36.771 --> 19:39.605
Because people are never
who they say they are.

19:39.607 --> 19:41.524
And even if they are,
they end up changing.

19:41.526 --> 19:44.327
Relationships, they don't work.
They don't last forever.

19:44.329 --> 19:45.361
Bottom line. That's it.

19:45.363 --> 19:47.480
What has gotten into you today?

19:47.482 --> 19:52.017
Uh, Gabby, she was offered

19:52.019 --> 19:57.123
a six-month curatorship
in Denver, Colorado.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.208
Oh! Oh, well,
why didn't you say so?

19:59.210 --> 20:00.660
That is terrible.

20:00.662 --> 20:02.662
Well, it is terrible
considering the last time

20:02.664 --> 20:04.880
she left for a job,
she almost didn't come back.

20:04.882 --> 20:07.199
- Ah. - Ah.
Okay.

20:07.201 --> 20:10.569
Can't really tell her not
to take the job, either.

20:10.571 --> 20:12.221
She actually said
that she wasn't gonna take it

20:12.223 --> 20:13.472
if I wasn't comfortable.

20:13.474 --> 20:15.708
Oh, good! You're clearly not
comfortable, so...

20:15.710 --> 20:18.544
What am I supposed to do?
It's a no-win. I cannot win.

20:18.546 --> 20:21.731
I make her stay, and then she
resents me, I let her go,

20:21.733 --> 20:22.715
and I'm miserable.

20:22.717 --> 20:24.567
You want my advice?
Absolutely not.

20:24.569 --> 20:25.884
When Catherine was gonna
turn down the job

20:25.886 --> 20:26.969
that Billy offered her

20:26.971 --> 20:28.254
because of me,
you know what I told her?

20:28.256 --> 20:29.488
I told her
to take the job.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.574
That's because you're stupid

20:31.576 --> 20:32.942
and you don't listen to anybody.

20:32.944 --> 20:35.327
'Cause I didn't want her
to pass by

20:35.329 --> 20:37.396
a great career opportunity
because of me.

20:37.398 --> 20:39.782
You told your girlfriend
that it was okay to take a job

20:39.784 --> 20:41.283
with her good-looking ex.

20:41.285 --> 20:43.786
All right, that is not noble,
it's stupid.

20:43.788 --> 20:45.121
Let me ask you a question then.

20:45.123 --> 20:47.506
If Gabby asked you
to put your career on hold

20:47.508 --> 20:48.874
and move to Denver,
would you do that?

20:48.876 --> 20:51.377
No, I wouldn't do that.
But I got a daughter

20:51.379 --> 20:53.746
who lives here.
It's not the same thing.

20:55.348 --> 20:57.383
Plus you'd miss me
too much.

20:57.385 --> 20:59.051
Plus I'd miss you too much.

20:59.053 --> 21:01.370
There you go.

21:05.226 --> 21:06.425
Lieutenant Kelly.

21:07.594 --> 21:09.478
Chin, it's me.

21:10.313 --> 21:12.598
Kono, how are you?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.200
Where are you?

21:14.202 --> 21:15.968
Kowloon. We got a lead
on the shooters

21:15.970 --> 21:17.436
that came after us.

21:17.438 --> 21:19.655
We managed to get the drop
on one of their associates.

21:19.657 --> 21:21.040
He give you anything?

21:22.376 --> 21:23.993
Riku Sato.

21:23.995 --> 21:25.277
Have you heard of him?

21:25.279 --> 21:26.579
Yeah. He's the Oyabun for one

21:26.581 --> 21:28.297
of the largest Yakuza families
in Japan.

21:28.299 --> 21:31.467
But why is he coming after Adam?
I thought they were allies.

21:31.469 --> 21:32.551
They were.

21:32.553 --> 21:33.753
But something's changed.

21:33.755 --> 21:36.955
This isn't about revenge
for Michael's death anymore.

21:36.957 --> 21:38.224
How can you be so sure?

21:38.226 --> 21:41.644
Because they don't just want
Adam dead,

21:41.646 --> 21:43.112
they want me, too.

21:43.114 --> 21:44.680
Kono...

21:44.682 --> 21:45.981
Chin, I can handle this.

21:45.983 --> 21:48.400
Well, at least let me call
the Hong Kong police department

21:48.402 --> 21:50.402
so they can get you
to a safe place.

21:50.404 --> 21:54.156
No. No, Sato has strong ties
to the Chinese triads,

21:54.158 --> 21:55.641
and they own the police.

21:55.643 --> 21:57.026
We can't trust anyone
right now.

21:57.028 --> 21:58.944
All right, well, then you guys
need to keep moving.

21:58.946 --> 22:01.413
Get out of Hong Kong.
Get out of Asia.

22:01.415 --> 22:02.998
That's the plan.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.333
Get me off speakerphone.

22:09.506 --> 22:10.539
Yeah?

22:10.541 --> 22:12.341
You promised me

22:12.343 --> 22:14.593
you would take care of Kono.

22:14.595 --> 22:15.961
Now do it.

22:22.786 --> 22:24.487
No.

22:24.489 --> 22:26.322
There's got to
be some mistake.

22:26.324 --> 22:27.556
I am inclined

22:27.558 --> 22:30.392
to agree
with my son.

22:30.394 --> 22:32.912
I'm sorry, are we missing
something here?

22:32.914 --> 22:34.814
My-my firm did a full
background check on Dahlia.

22:34.816 --> 22:36.282
I-I don't understand

22:36.284 --> 22:39.168
how the investigators could
have missed something like this.

22:39.170 --> 22:40.853
You ran a background
check on my fiancée?

22:40.855 --> 22:43.072
And you wonder why I never wanted
anything to do with the business.

22:43.074 --> 22:45.007
Okay.

22:45.009 --> 22:46.542
I'll-I'll go
talk to him.

22:46.544 --> 22:47.660
Give me a minute.

23:00.340 --> 23:03.008
What kills me is that my
mother's right.

23:04.144 --> 23:06.545
I feel so stupid.

23:06.547 --> 23:09.849
You're not the first guy
to fall for it, Nathan.

23:09.851 --> 23:11.066
Dahlia and
her brother

23:11.068 --> 23:12.885
have been running
this con for years.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.858
I hope you find her so
I can look her in the eye

23:18.860 --> 23:20.910
and ask her how
she could do this to me.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.265
Yo, Chin,
where are you?

23:26.267 --> 23:27.550
I'm headed toward
Tantalus Drive.

23:27.552 --> 23:29.902
It's the last place that
Dahlia's cell phone

23:29.904 --> 23:31.954
registered a signal.

23:31.956 --> 23:33.572
And that was at 7:30 last night,

23:33.574 --> 23:34.907
and after that, nothing.

23:34.909 --> 23:35.925
Tantalus has notoriously

23:35.927 --> 23:37.075
bad cell phone reception.

23:37.077 --> 23:38.260
Look, she was
trying to lay low.

23:38.262 --> 23:40.195
She was on the run.
Maybe she chucked her phone.

23:40.197 --> 23:43.082
Or maybe she never
left the area.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.138
Oh, look. Look, look.
It's, uh...

23:49.140 --> 23:51.340
Catherine's boss-
slash-ex-boyfriend.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.359
Uh, Billy? Is that his name?
Yes.

23:53.361 --> 23:54.193
You know his name's Billy.

23:54.195 --> 23:56.762
Huh. Billy.

23:59.616 --> 24:00.950
What's he doing here?

24:00.952 --> 24:02.284
They're supposed to be working.
Oh, maybe he's

24:02.286 --> 24:04.603
come to ask you for
her hand in marriage.

24:06.373 --> 24:07.890
You're actually enjoying
this, aren't you?

24:07.892 --> 24:10.609
Oh, we all gotta be
reminded of our mistakes, babe.

24:12.946 --> 24:13.946
Billy.

24:13.948 --> 24:15.497
What's up?

24:15.499 --> 24:17.833
Cath just headed
up to see you.

24:17.835 --> 24:19.268
What are you doing,
keeping the car warm?

24:19.270 --> 24:21.303
We gotta make it a short visit.
We're on a job.

24:21.305 --> 24:22.638
Hey, you remember

24:22.640 --> 24:23.772
Detective
Danny Williams?

24:23.774 --> 24:24.890
Hey, it's my pleasure.
Of course.

24:24.892 --> 24:26.675
Good to see you.
Again.

24:27.979 --> 24:29.678
Actually, I'm glad
I ran into you.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.213
I never got a chance
to thank you.

24:32.148 --> 24:33.098
For what?

24:33.100 --> 24:34.400
Oh, for being cool
with all this.

24:34.402 --> 24:35.935
Catherine
told me

24:35.937 --> 24:38.103
how you encouraged her
to take the job.

24:38.105 --> 24:39.021
Don't mention it.

24:39.023 --> 24:40.138
Truth is, I'm lucky
to have her.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.306
We make
a great team.

24:41.308 --> 24:42.524
That's good.

24:42.526 --> 24:44.309
It's good to see you.

24:44.311 --> 24:45.527
You, too.

24:45.529 --> 24:46.478
Little Wing,

24:46.480 --> 24:48.297
this is Big Kahuna,
be advised:

24:48.299 --> 24:49.748
Commander McGarrett is
headed to your position.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.649
You guys got code names
for each other?

24:51.674 --> 24:52.369
Yeah.

24:52.370 --> 24:54.203
That's cute.

24:56.589 --> 24:57.589
Whew...

25:00.761 --> 25:03.345
Looking sharp, Rollins.

25:03.347 --> 25:05.431
With the earpiece,
the whole thing, huh?

25:05.433 --> 25:06.598
Yeah.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.884
Billy and I are running
a personal security detail

25:08.886 --> 25:10.636
on a visiting
Saudi diplomat, so...

25:10.638 --> 25:11.637
Nice.

25:11.639 --> 25:13.022
Women, I know they
dress modestly there,

25:13.024 --> 25:15.307
but I mean, the way
this guy looks at me,

25:15.309 --> 25:16.825
you'd think I was wearing
a string bikini.

25:16.827 --> 25:18.360
What's his name?
I'll beat him up.

25:18.362 --> 25:20.646
Okay, see,
that's sort of exactly

25:20.648 --> 25:22.347
what we're being
paid to prevent.

25:22.349 --> 25:23.532
Oh! Right.
Okay.

25:23.534 --> 25:24.566
Yes. So that
would be bad.

25:24.568 --> 25:25.701
Got it.

25:25.703 --> 25:27.619
Which leads me to
the reason why I'm here.

25:27.621 --> 25:29.121
What, you're not here...
I thought you'd come

25:29.123 --> 25:30.355
to show me your
new pantsuit.

25:30.357 --> 25:32.041
No, smart-ass.
I need a favor.

25:32.043 --> 25:34.192
What do you need?
So, uh...

25:34.194 --> 25:36.028
our client has a packed
schedule tomorrow,

25:36.030 --> 25:37.696
and Billy asked me to run
some threat assessments

25:37.698 --> 25:39.064
on all the people
he's meeting with.

25:39.066 --> 25:40.499
Only...

25:40.501 --> 25:42.301
You don't have access
to Navy Intel anymore.

25:42.303 --> 25:43.469
So you thought you'd
come to Five-O

25:43.471 --> 25:44.470
and run the
background checks.

25:44.472 --> 25:46.088
Mm-hmm.
Ah.

25:46.090 --> 25:48.257
Look at you.
You are handsome and smart.

25:48.259 --> 25:50.225
Uh... ah...

25:50.227 --> 25:51.643
I don't know
how I feel

25:51.645 --> 25:52.978
about allocating
Five-O resources

25:52.980 --> 25:54.563
to a private
security job.

25:55.849 --> 25:57.683
Okay. Um...

25:57.685 --> 25:59.068
Remind me again

25:59.070 --> 26:00.385
how many satellites

26:00.387 --> 26:02.187
I have repositioned
for you over the years.

26:02.189 --> 26:03.272
Hmm?

26:03.274 --> 26:05.240
You owe me.

26:05.242 --> 26:07.076
Steve...
Okay, okay, okay. Relax.

26:07.078 --> 26:08.444
Come on,
I'll log you in.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.302
Dahlia!

27:07.304 --> 27:09.138
Dahlia!
Can you hear me?

27:20.230 --> 27:21.647
<i>Air One to Incident Command.</i>

27:21.649 --> 27:23.633
Be advised that we have
the wreck in sight,

27:23.634 --> 27:24.599
and the victim seems to

27:24.601 --> 27:26.334
<i>still be within the vehicle.</i>

27:26.336 --> 27:29.704
<i>Air One, 10-4.</i>

27:29.706 --> 27:30.872
Dahlia!

27:30.874 --> 27:32.741
We've stabilized
your neck.

27:32.743 --> 27:35.210
We're gonna slide you out
onto a stretcher.

27:35.212 --> 27:36.678
Just stay calm.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.429
There's a helicopter here

27:38.431 --> 27:40.598
that's gonna take you
to a hospital, okay?

27:48.958 --> 27:50.992
Okay.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.618
Okay, Dahlia.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.801
Give me a minute, Mom.

28:35.671 --> 28:37.873
I'm so sorry, Nathan.

28:39.292 --> 28:40.358
I love you.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.993
I always have.

28:41.995 --> 28:44.329
Everything you ever
told me was a lie.

28:45.681 --> 28:47.516
Even your name.

28:47.518 --> 28:49.751
How do you expect me to believe
anything you say now?

28:49.753 --> 28:51.937
Just, please,
let me explain, okay?

28:51.939 --> 28:53.205
I don't want
to hear about it.

28:53.207 --> 28:55.473
You know, when I heard
what happened to you,

28:55.475 --> 28:57.442
some tiny part of me

28:57.444 --> 28:59.644
still cared whether
you lived or died.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.815
Now I don't know
why it mattered.

29:07.703 --> 29:08.720
Sweetheart.

29:08.722 --> 29:11.623
Sweetheart,
wait, wait.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.874
Nathan!

29:16.178 --> 29:17.295
You know what,
give him some space.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.713
You can't help
him right now.

29:18.715 --> 29:19.731
Are you
really sure

29:19.733 --> 29:21.216
that Dahlia
did those things?

29:21.218 --> 29:23.919
Yeah, we're, uh...
we're certain.

29:23.921 --> 29:25.770
I mean, she left behind
a trail of victims,

29:25.772 --> 29:27.305
so, yeah.
Excuse us.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.507
Please.

29:34.931 --> 29:37.182
I'm not going to pretend
I'm sad he's dead.

29:38.434 --> 29:40.318
My brother
was a monster.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.319
That's why
you ran

29:41.321 --> 29:43.271
when you saw him
at the wedding, huh?

29:43.273 --> 29:44.739
You don't know the things
he's capable of.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.941
Oh, we do.

29:45.943 --> 29:47.058
Uh, we read his jacket.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.243
We read yours, too.

29:49.862 --> 29:51.713
I made a lot
of mistakes, okay?

29:51.715 --> 29:53.281
I won't deny that.

29:53.283 --> 29:55.750
But I wasn't after
Nathan's money.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.035
I love him.

29:57.037 --> 29:59.537
Okay, I mean, well,
it seems very convenient.

29:59.539 --> 30:01.172
I mean, you leave
a life as a con

30:01.174 --> 30:03.258
to then fall in love
with a guy

30:03.260 --> 30:04.509
who's filthy rich.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.910
I know how
it looks.

30:05.912 --> 30:08.179
But I didn't find out
about Nathan's money

30:08.181 --> 30:09.464
until we were engaged.

30:09.466 --> 30:11.449
I swear.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.419
I guess
I was crazy,

30:14.421 --> 30:16.087
thinking that my past
wouldn't catch up with me

30:16.089 --> 30:19.858
and I would actually
get a fresh start.

30:21.193 --> 30:22.327
I keep thinking if...

30:22.329 --> 30:24.813
only if I had
just stayed

30:24.815 --> 30:27.465
and told Nathan the
truth, you know...

30:27.467 --> 30:29.067
maybe he would have
forgiven me.

30:29.069 --> 30:31.086
But instead, you ran out

30:31.088 --> 30:32.954
on your own wedding.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.939
When I saw Brad there,
I panicked.

30:34.941 --> 30:37.242
All I knew was that
I had to get away from him.

30:37.244 --> 30:40.745
So I just got in
the car and...

30:40.747 --> 30:42.280
drove.

30:43.332 --> 30:45.133
How'd you end up
crashing the car?

30:46.252 --> 30:47.902
I was speeding.

30:49.338 --> 30:50.705
<i>There was a truck...</i>

30:54.727 --> 30:57.262
It was only maybe
a few minutes later

30:57.264 --> 30:58.713
that I heard
someone pull up.

31:00.049 --> 31:03.018
<i>I called for help.</i>

31:03.020 --> 31:05.320
They found me...

31:05.322 --> 31:06.888
<i>There were footsteps.</i>

31:08.557 --> 31:10.011
No!

31:10.279 --> 31:12.063
No!

31:12.065 --> 31:14.215
No! No!

31:16.685 --> 31:19.220
That's when everything
went black.

31:19.222 --> 31:21.973
Crime Lab finished
processing the car wreck.

31:21.975 --> 31:23.691
They pulled a shoe print
off the rear fender.

31:23.693 --> 31:25.276
Size 11.

31:25.278 --> 31:26.644
Tread pattern
matches the shoes

31:26.646 --> 31:28.179
Dixon was found dead in.
So...

31:28.181 --> 31:29.614
Dixon, he, uh...

31:29.616 --> 31:31.115
follows his sister
out of the wedding,

31:31.117 --> 31:32.667
and catches up
with her

31:32.669 --> 31:33.951
at the scene
of the accident.

31:33.953 --> 31:35.653
He's packing a gun,
looking for revenge,

31:35.655 --> 31:37.187
but then he figures
he can save a bullet

31:37.189 --> 31:38.723
and send Dahlia to her death

31:38.725 --> 31:39.857
in a fiery
wreck.

31:39.859 --> 31:41.325
Okay, well,
that's one mystery solved.

31:41.327 --> 31:42.693
But it still
doesn't explain

31:42.695 --> 31:44.328
how Dixon ends up dead
in a hotel room.

31:44.330 --> 31:45.546
Yeah, I don't get
that, either.

31:45.548 --> 31:46.664
I mean, if it's me,
I'm out of there,

31:46.666 --> 31:47.882
I'm on the first plane.

31:47.884 --> 31:49.634
Right, but he's gotta
clear the hotel room first.

31:49.636 --> 31:51.035
But before he can
get out of there,

31:51.037 --> 31:52.803
somebody confronts him
and then shoots him with his own gun.

31:52.805 --> 31:53.804
Wait a minute.

31:53.806 --> 31:55.589
Dixon checked in using one of

31:55.591 --> 31:57.058
his former aliases,
John Fitzpatrick, right?

31:57.060 --> 31:59.043
Yeah.
So how does our killer know

31:59.045 --> 32:00.978
what name to ask for
to find the right room?

32:00.980 --> 32:02.313
Well, maybe he knew him
under that name.

32:02.315 --> 32:03.881
Hey, maybe it's a...
old accomplice

32:03.883 --> 32:05.266
or somebody he burned.

32:05.268 --> 32:07.652
Or somebody who found out
about his criminal history.

32:07.654 --> 32:09.855
Which would have come back
in Dahlia's background check.

32:14.242 --> 32:16.243
Barbara.

32:16.245 --> 32:17.762
Uh, come in.

32:21.416 --> 32:23.617
How-how's Nathan
holding up?

32:24.953 --> 32:26.253
I want to see
the report.

32:26.255 --> 32:27.955
I'm sorry?

32:27.957 --> 32:30.524
The background report
I had you run on Dahlia.

32:30.526 --> 32:31.792
I paid for it.

32:31.794 --> 32:32.977
Now I'd like
to see it.

32:32.979 --> 32:36.297
Okay, I-I know
you're upset.

32:36.299 --> 32:38.182
We've all been caught off
guard by what happened.

32:38.184 --> 32:40.184
But I can assure you
there is nothing in that report

32:40.186 --> 32:41.635
that indicates
any issues.

32:41.637 --> 32:43.270
I will be
the judge of that.

32:45.858 --> 32:47.475
All right,
look...

32:47.477 --> 32:49.610
my investigators
dropped the ball.

32:49.612 --> 32:51.145
I'm sorry.

32:51.147 --> 32:53.197
The report in 24 hours

32:53.199 --> 32:55.366
or you're fired.

32:58.937 --> 33:00.421
You can have it now.

33:00.423 --> 33:01.639
Just give me a second

33:01.641 --> 33:03.908
to pull it up on my computer.

33:03.910 --> 33:06.077
Okay.

33:14.921 --> 33:16.754
Fire me?

33:17.839 --> 33:20.389
I don't think so.

33:21.819 --> 33:23.969
Sit!

33:25.339 --> 33:27.306
I don't get it, Allen.

33:27.308 --> 33:29.424
Why would you keep
that information from us?

33:29.426 --> 33:31.193
What's in it for you?

33:31.195 --> 33:32.361
It doesn't matter.

33:32.363 --> 33:33.846
Here's what's gonna happen now.

33:33.848 --> 33:35.481
You're gonna wire $5 million

33:35.483 --> 33:37.533
into a numbered account
in the Caymans,

33:37.535 --> 33:38.817
and I'm gonna disappear.

33:38.819 --> 33:41.921
Call it my severance.

33:42.772 --> 33:44.606
Sorry.

33:45.275 --> 33:47.243
You get nothing.

33:47.245 --> 33:48.260
Excuse me?

33:48.262 --> 33:49.995
Nothing.

33:49.997 --> 33:51.914
Really?

33:51.916 --> 33:53.816
Hey, hey, hey!
Drop the weapon.

33:53.818 --> 33:55.017
Put the gun down.

33:55.019 --> 33:56.902
Put the gun down right now.
Okay, okay!

33:56.904 --> 33:58.470
Hands behind your
head and turn around.

33:58.472 --> 34:00.339
Get on your knees.

34:00.341 --> 34:01.807
Cross your feet.

34:01.809 --> 34:03.859
Did you get what you need?

34:03.861 --> 34:05.127
Yeah, I'd say we got
everything we need.

34:05.129 --> 34:06.345
Thank you.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.134
So you've had a, uh,

34:12.136 --> 34:15.020
busy 24 hours
in the Aloha State.

34:15.022 --> 34:16.822
We got, uh...

34:16.824 --> 34:19.408
attempted extortion, murder.

34:19.409 --> 34:20.976
What else?

34:22.980 --> 34:24.146
Exercising your right
to silence?

34:24.148 --> 34:26.081
That's the first
smart thing you've done.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.701
We matched the gun that
you pulled on Barbara Cotchin

34:28.703 --> 34:30.619
to the one that was used
to kill Brad Dixon.

34:30.621 --> 34:34.156
Probably figured
that a lawyer would know better

34:34.158 --> 34:36.458
than to hold onto
the murder weapon.

34:37.493 --> 34:40.129
12 years you worked
for that family

34:40.130 --> 34:41.847
without ever once receiving
the recognition

34:41.849 --> 34:43.465
that you felt you deserved.

34:43.467 --> 34:46.351
Until Dahlia's background check
comes back.

34:46.353 --> 34:47.937
All you got to do

34:47.938 --> 34:49.670
is wait for the wedding
to go off without a hitch.

34:49.672 --> 34:51.273
And then you can hold
that potential scandal

34:51.275 --> 34:52.524
over Barbara Cotchin's head

34:52.525 --> 34:53.943
and get whatever you want.

34:53.945 --> 34:55.159
The plan doesn't go
the way you want it to.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.695
Dahlia's brother shows up.

34:56.697 --> 34:58.948
You track him
back to his room

34:58.950 --> 35:00.449
and you popped him
with his own gun.

35:00.451 --> 35:01.784
That about cover it or what?

35:01.786 --> 35:04.853
You really think I'm dumb enough
to blackmail Barbara Cotchin?

35:04.855 --> 35:08.523
You go up against power
like that and you lose.

35:08.525 --> 35:10.042
Dahlia...

35:10.877 --> 35:12.361
Dhalia was a weak target.

35:12.363 --> 35:15.697
I knew she'd cut me in on
whatever con she was running.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.783
Oh.

35:17.785 --> 35:20.202
Oh, so you...
so we actually

35:20.204 --> 35:22.004
have given you more credit
than you deserve.

35:22.006 --> 35:23.806
This was just about putting
a little extra money

35:23.808 --> 35:24.923
in your pocket, that's it?

35:24.925 --> 35:26.375
Did you, did you ever consider

35:26.377 --> 35:29.011
that perhaps Dahlia was not
marrying Nathan for his money?

35:29.013 --> 35:32.014
What else is there?

35:38.088 --> 35:39.772
<i>The German prosecutors</i>
<i>sent over</i>

35:39.774 --> 35:40.990
their files this morning.

35:40.992 --> 35:42.741
Turns out they only
became aware of the case

35:42.743 --> 35:44.326
when Dahlia turned
herself in.

35:44.328 --> 35:46.578
Why would she do that?

35:46.580 --> 35:48.030
When Dahlia was
14 years old,

35:48.032 --> 35:51.066
both her parents died and
Brad became her custodian.

35:51.068 --> 35:53.568
He threatened
to abandon her

35:53.570 --> 35:56.255
if she didn't go along
with the scams.

35:59.759 --> 36:01.810
I don't know what
to think anymore.

36:01.812 --> 36:03.962
I understand.

36:03.964 --> 36:05.431
I was thinking maybe

36:05.433 --> 36:07.216
this would help
you figure that out.

36:07.218 --> 36:08.567
HPD found it

36:08.569 --> 36:09.768
in the car wreck.

36:09.770 --> 36:12.187
I thought you should have it.

36:12.189 --> 36:13.722
Good luck, Nathan.

36:23.766 --> 36:25.784
<i>"For so much of my life,</i>

36:25.786 --> 36:28.603
<i>"I believed I was unworthy</i>
<i>of anyone's love.</i>

36:28.605 --> 36:31.206
<i>"But then I met you</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>

36:31.208 --> 36:32.374
<i>"I realized</i>

36:32.376 --> 36:33.959
<i>"that if you could see</i>
<i>the good in me,</i>

36:33.961 --> 36:37.079
<i>"then maybe I could</i>
<i>see the good in myself.</i>

36:37.081 --> 36:40.082
"The truth is that in more ways
<i>than you'll ever know,</i>

36:40.084 --> 36:42.584
<i>"you saved me.</i>

36:42.586 --> 36:43.886
<i>"And for that reason</i>

36:43.888 --> 36:45.254
<i>"and so many more,</i>

36:45.256 --> 36:47.773
<i>"I promise</i>
<i>to be eternally faithful</i>

36:47.775 --> 36:49.174
<i>"and to honor you so long</i>

36:49.176 --> 36:51.427
<i>as we both shall live."</i>

37:01.271 --> 37:02.438
Nathan?

37:02.440 --> 37:05.107
When I asked you to marry me,

37:05.109 --> 37:08.077
I said I would love you
no matter what.

37:08.079 --> 37:11.580
And I meant what I said.

37:11.582 --> 37:15.117
You are everything to me.

37:15.119 --> 37:16.902
And I can't

37:16.904 --> 37:19.505
imagine my life without you.

37:25.712 --> 37:27.162
Nathan?

37:29.183 --> 37:30.682
It's not the beachside wedding

37:30.684 --> 37:34.019
with the band
and the orchids you love.

37:34.021 --> 37:37.506
But I don't want to go another
day without you as my wife.

37:39.976 --> 37:42.728
We are gathered here today
to join this man

37:42.730 --> 37:44.196
and this woman

37:44.198 --> 37:46.648
in holy matrimony.

37:46.650 --> 37:47.983
Do you, Dahlia,

37:47.985 --> 37:50.886
take Nathan to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

37:50.888 --> 37:53.572
promising to love,
honor and cherish him

37:53.574 --> 37:55.857
as long as
you both shall live?

38:01.381 --> 38:03.031
For thousands of years,

38:03.033 --> 38:05.384
one of the world's great
archeological enigmas...

38:07.221 --> 38:08.670
Hey.

38:08.672 --> 38:10.389
Hi.

38:10.391 --> 38:12.841
Grace just fell asleep.

38:19.799 --> 38:21.066
Hi.

38:21.068 --> 38:23.218
Hi.

38:24.887 --> 38:26.038
So...?

38:26.040 --> 38:28.407
So...

38:28.409 --> 38:31.193
I just want us
to be happy.

38:31.195 --> 38:34.363
And if that means

38:34.365 --> 38:37.082
that I say no to this job,

38:37.084 --> 38:39.117
then that's what I'll do.

38:40.787 --> 38:44.089
I, um, I really like that idea.

38:44.091 --> 38:46.542
But I cannot, um,

38:46.544 --> 38:49.511
be the guy that makes
you put your career on hold.

38:49.513 --> 38:51.897
I can't do that.

38:52.732 --> 38:55.634
Then it's just six months.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.938
And we will make it work.

39:03.092 --> 39:05.260
Yeah, you know,
I thought about that, too.

39:05.262 --> 39:07.229
And it six months,
but then, I mean,

39:07.231 --> 39:09.565
there's gonna be
another offer, right?

39:09.567 --> 39:12.568
And I... listen,
I-I don't have a problem

39:12.570 --> 39:14.269
with you coming and going.

39:14.271 --> 39:15.404
I-I really don't at all.

39:15.406 --> 39:17.272
I mean, I'd rather
have you here part-time

39:17.274 --> 39:19.875
than not at all.

39:19.877 --> 39:25.364
You know, but Grace...

39:25.366 --> 39:27.099
I know how she feels
about you.

39:27.101 --> 39:29.067
And I...

39:29.069 --> 39:32.804
I cannot keep taking
that away from her.

39:32.806 --> 39:35.557
You know, I mean,
the whole reason I moved here

39:35.559 --> 39:37.792
in the first place was
to give her some stability.

39:37.794 --> 39:39.961
I...

39:47.987 --> 39:50.188
So...

39:54.827 --> 39:59.014
Well, our timing
really stinks, doesn't it?

40:04.254 --> 40:06.421
I don't know, I...

40:08.291 --> 40:11.927
Look, uh, before I met you,

40:11.929 --> 40:14.663
I, um, I was kind of looking
around trying to figure out

40:14.665 --> 40:16.331
another reason
to hate this place.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.333
Because I really,
really hated it.

40:18.335 --> 40:21.520
Um, and, uh...

40:21.522 --> 40:25.474
when I met you, you gave me...

40:25.476 --> 40:29.144
You made me realize
what I was missing.

40:29.146 --> 40:32.631
You know, I mean, you have
no idea what that means to me.

40:35.068 --> 40:37.302
I get it, okay?

40:39.305 --> 40:41.740
This is home for you now.

40:41.742 --> 40:43.875
And...

40:43.877 --> 40:47.879
maybe one day it
will be for me, too.

40:49.816 --> 40:52.868
Okay.

41:15.993 --> 41:17.659
Well, I have to admit.

41:17.661 --> 41:20.228
Part of me had doubts that
we could make this work.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.964
But after seeing you
in action today,

41:22.966 --> 41:25.584
I know I made
the right choice.

41:25.586 --> 41:28.120
Thanks.

41:28.122 --> 41:31.373
Although it kind of sounds like
you're congratulating yourself.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.375
It kind of did, didn't it?

41:34.193 --> 41:36.244
Mm.

41:39.232 --> 41:40.899
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 8:00.

41:40.901 --> 41:43.218
All right, coffee and malasadas,
on you.

41:55.732 --> 41:57.482
Hey.

41:58.317 --> 41:59.785
Hey.

42:03.072 --> 42:05.123
Couldn't sleep.

42:07.443 --> 42:10.245
I wanted to make sure
you got home okay is all.

42:10.247 --> 42:11.496
Aw.

42:11.498 --> 42:12.831
How was your first day?

42:12.833 --> 42:16.284
Uh, it was a big change.

42:16.286 --> 42:17.586
Yeah, I bet.
Mm-hmm.

42:17.588 --> 42:18.503
But in a good way.

42:18.505 --> 42:19.504
Good.
Yeah.

42:19.506 --> 42:21.223
Billy already got us
another gig,

42:21.225 --> 42:23.308
so I think...
I think we're gonna be busy.

42:23.310 --> 42:25.594
Good, I'm glad.

42:25.596 --> 42:26.928
Come here.

42:28.097 --> 42:29.297
I'm gonna go wash up.

42:29.299 --> 42:30.762
Will you, um, open us
a bottle of wine?

42:30.787 --> 42:31.851
Yeah.

42:31.852 --> 42:33.101
Red or white?

42:33.103 --> 42:34.302
Um...

42:34.304 --> 42:37.439
surprise me.
Okay.
