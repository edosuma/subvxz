WEBVTT

01:24.543 --> 01:25.544
What?

01:40.976 --> 01:43.103
Girl, fuck that. Just leave.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.521
I know. Like...

01:44.730 --> 01:47.316
I obviously don't mind paying,

01:47.399 --> 01:48.817
but what a weird way
to start off a date.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.152
That's what I'm sayin'.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.778
Is this what you tell your kids?

01:51.903 --> 01:54.615
"Oh, it was so romantic
before our first date, y'all.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.993
"He texted me, 'FYI,
this place is cash only.'"

01:58.160 --> 01:59.703
-No.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.664
I'm already here.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.874
Girl...

02:04.041 --> 02:05.667
I'm really fuckin' hungry.

02:05.751 --> 02:06.835
Mmm.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.379
I don't know. Hopefully,
it'll make for a good story.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.840
Call me after.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.134
-Love you.
-Okay, I love you more.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.302
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.803
Bye-bye.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.263
-Bye!

02:19.222 --> 02:22.351
Okay, let's do this.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.606
So I love hot sauce.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.941
I literally just put it
on every single thing

02:30.025 --> 02:31.735
I can find around the house sometimes.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.196
From pizza to chicken wings.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.240
Even though it gives me
terrible acid reflux.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.909
-Mmm.
-It makes its way up to my throat

02:38.992 --> 02:40.869
and I literally feel like
I'm gonna vomit.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.164
-So...
-Oh, yeah. That, um, sucks.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.208
-Mmm.
-But I love it, so...

02:46.291 --> 02:48.126
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.088
Like, I love wasabi, but, um,

02:51.296 --> 02:53.215
Mexican spices
would be too much for me.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.301
-Mmm. Yeah. I get that.
-Yeah.

02:56.802 --> 02:57.803
Yeah.

03:02.641 --> 03:03.684
Mmm.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.771
What?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.440
I had this crazy thought. I...

03:10.774 --> 03:12.150
I just feel like...

03:12.901 --> 03:14.820
the women
in our parents' generation,

03:15.028 --> 03:18.907
they just cared more
about how they dressed

03:18.990 --> 03:21.076
and just, kind of, how they looked.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.495
They were more into femininity.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.080
-You know what I mean?
-Mmm.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.416
Like, nowadays, I feel like girls,
they just wear

03:27.499 --> 03:29.876
oversized everything,
like it's a blanket.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.003
Do you know what I mean?
You know what I'm saying, right?

03:32.129 --> 03:33.338
-Um...
-It's like...

03:33.422 --> 03:36.216
'Cause I think you would
just look great in a dress.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.052
Not that you don't look good
in a sweater,

03:39.219 --> 03:40.721
-but I mean, if you were...
-You guys okay?

03:40.804 --> 03:44.266
Uh, yeah. Um, pretty much
done, actually. Thank you.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.018
Cool. Yeah, we'll just
get this wrapped up then.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.354
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.565
Oh, did you bring cash?

03:51.732 --> 03:54.317
Yeah. You reminded me, so...

03:54.401 --> 03:57.529
My brother is coming into town.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.906
If it's cool, I'm just gonna
snag these leftovers

03:59.990 --> 04:02.033
and, uh, I guess
I'll just let you leave...

04:02.117 --> 04:03.160
Cool. No. Yeah.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.287
...a couple bucks less
on the tip.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.580
If that makes sense.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.751
Your scarf is dipping
into the noodles.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.627
Oh, fuck!

04:12.711 --> 04:13.754
Shit!

04:14.963 --> 04:17.340
I love this scarf. Um...

04:17.424 --> 04:19.384
Excuse me? Excuse me.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.802
Quick, come.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.222
Hi, do you have sparkling water?

04:24.306 --> 04:25.807
-Sparkling.
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.768
-Bubble. You know bubbles?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.978
And a lemon, please?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.564
I don't know if she understood
what I said.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.732
I don't think she speaks English.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.745
That was, uh, that was fun.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.997
You're really cute.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.957
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.585
We should do this again sometime.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.505
Yeah, look, Chad, um...

04:56.588 --> 04:58.632
-Yeah.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.592
Oh. I... I don't

05:00.842 --> 05:03.553
think we're really a match.
You know?

05:03.678 --> 05:04.805
Wow.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.598
I was literally just being polite.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.850
You're not even my type,
to be honest, so...

05:09.684 --> 05:10.727
Okay.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.772
Oh, that's funny?
"Ha-ha, it's hilarious"? Yeah.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.733
Okay. Good luck finding a guy,
you stuck-up bitch.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.403
Um...

05:25.367 --> 05:27.786
What the fuck.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.657
Oh, fuck.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.166
Oh. Stupid idiot.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.003
Can you please
just text him and write,

06:18.128 --> 06:21.381
"Fuck you and your
ugly-ass scarf, bitch."

06:21.506 --> 06:24.009
Oh, see, I wish I thought
of that in the moment.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.177
Instead I just stood there like an idiot.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.804
-Let's switch.
-Yeah.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.806
I don't know how you do it, Mollie.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.516
Do what?

06:31.683 --> 06:32.934
Dating people.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.770
And I always end up alone.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.190
Which, by the way,
I'm very okay with.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.776
No, no. What?

06:42.527 --> 06:45.906
You do not need a man, okay?
Or anybody, for that matter.

06:46.448 --> 06:50.076
It's just the way we've been raised
since fuckin' Disney movies.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.287
-Yeah. Fuck Ariel.
-Fuck her.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.497
Stupid bitch left the whole sea for a man.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.707
-Come on, now.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.250
Like, fuck... Fuck Beauty.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.294
Yeah, fuck the Beast.
I am the beast.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.796
-You are the beast! Get it!

07:03.882 --> 07:06.134
Time, everyone!

07:06.343 --> 07:09.137
Whoo! Great job today, huh?

07:09.387 --> 07:10.639
I mean that.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.891
-Now give yourselves a round of applause.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.935
-Whoo!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.061
Great job!

07:16.144 --> 07:18.521
-Bam!
-Ah!

07:18.647 --> 07:20.732
-You are powerful!
-You are powerful!

07:20.899 --> 07:22.651
-Look at how strong you are.
-Look at this.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.148
Oh, fuck.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.063
Have you ever had these?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.318
Grapes?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.987
No. Cotton Candy grapes.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.156
They taste just like them.
I'm not kiddin'.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.783
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.367
I told my sister and niece.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.660
They were like,
"No way, fuck you."

09:37.786 --> 09:39.537
So now I'm getting them
on my way there.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.122
Your niece said, "Fuck you"?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.750
-Yeah. Four-year-olds are crazy.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.170
All right.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.130
I can tell you don't believe me,

09:49.297 --> 09:51.132
so you're gonna have to try one.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.343
I don't want you leaving here
thinking I'm a weirdo.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.348
Okay.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.231
-Right?
-Holy shit. Mmm.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.775
-Wow.
-Science.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.653
Yeah. Go science.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.446
Do you live around here?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.699
-'Cause I live on aisle six.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.618
I just come to the fruit section

10:18.701 --> 10:20.870
to talk to random,
very good-looking people

10:20.954 --> 10:22.413
that stand near it.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.458
That was terrible.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.127
That was kinda terrible.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.295
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.547
Have a good night.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.423
Okay. You, too.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.222
You know what? Fuck it.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.142
I'm already ruining this,
so I'm just gonna keep goin'.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.978
Do you think
I could have your number?

10:45.103 --> 10:47.605
-Oh.
-It's really just so I have a story

10:47.689 --> 10:49.357
for my sister and my niece
when I see them.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.651
Because I think we're
gonna talk about the grapes.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.319
Oh, of course. Yeah.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.405
Then I can tell them
that I met someone else

10:55.613 --> 10:57.657
who feels the same way.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.242
Sure. Makes sense, yeah.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.035
Okay.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.166
We can meet here next week
to talk about the broccoli if you want.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.667
Sounds good.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.837
Oh.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.381
-Mist.
-Rain forest.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.093
Always good to have a little mist, Noa.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.636
-Yes, mystery.
-Yeah.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.305
I'm Steve.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.057
-It's nice to meet you.
-You, too.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.768
I'm not gonna text you,
but I'll really want to.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.938
Good night.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.148
Good night.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.069
- What?
- Yeah.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.487
- Your number?
- Yeah.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.198
- In a grocery store?
- Yeah.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.699
- The other night?
- Yes.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.409
And you're just now
telling me today?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.702
-Wow.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.078
When you think you had a friend.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.164
No, I just think it was weird,
you know? He was...

11:47.040 --> 11:50.251
He was cute and funny and...

11:50.335 --> 11:51.336
Mmm. Okay.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.631
I didn't think people met people
in real life anymore, you know?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.091
He's probably married.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.135
Thank you for that.
Yes, he's probably married.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.386
Probably.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.347
Like, I'm already thinking
about the fact

12:02.472 --> 12:04.057
-he hasn't texted.
-Mmm.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.768
That's one of the things
I love about dating women.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.647
Less games, more emotional dependence,
you know?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.025
So don't play the games,

12:14.150 --> 12:16.402
just be you straight out the gate.
Fuck it.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.487
Maybe.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.073
Hey, do you want to come over later?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.492
-I could use some emotional dependence.
-Aww.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.328
Well, my emotional dependence
ain't cheap, boo.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.038
-Let me tell you.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.101
-Hi.
-Hey!

12:49.060 --> 12:50.937
How you doin'?

12:51.187 --> 12:53.690
-Good, thanks. How are you?
-Good. Good.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.692
This place is really nice.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.568
-Yeah.
-The bears are, you know...

12:57.652 --> 13:01.572
Yeah. It's like the perfect amount
of, you know, grimy, but hip.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.657
Exactly.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.619
-You guys know what you want?
-Hi. Um...

13:06.744 --> 13:11.332
Can I get a Manhattan with, like,
as many cherries as you can spare, please?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.960
-Cherries. I like that.
-I love cherries.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.837
Yeah. I'll do
one more of these, thank you.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.005
Copy.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.756
Here you go. Here.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.383
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.759
Ay-yo.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.430
-Hi.
-Hey.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.556
-I'm Steve.
-Oh.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.932
Noa.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.058
Um...

13:29.142 --> 13:32.687
All right, so, uh...
Here come the dumb questions.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.105
Where are you from?

13:34.230 --> 13:37.025
Um,
I'm from the East Coast originally,

13:37.108 --> 13:38.151
-yeah.
-Nice.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.402
What about you?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.487
-I'm from Texas. Yeah.
-Oh. Cool.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.864
What brought you out here?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.490
My second residency.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.492
-Oh! Residency.
-Yeah.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.869
Are you a doc...

13:47.952 --> 13:49.370
-A doctor?
-I'm a doctor. Yeah.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.538
Oh! Wow!

13:50.663 --> 13:53.041
-Yeah. Yeah. Um...
-That's impressive.

13:53.124 --> 13:57.253
I just... I work
in reconstructive surgery.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.797
You mean, um, plastic surgery.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.382
-Yup. That's the one.
-Right.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.884
-There's only one.
-Okay.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.553
But it's not all nose jobs.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.180
No, of course.
You got, you know...

14:07.263 --> 14:08.639
-Boob jobs.
-Boob jobs.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.309
-You got your butt lifts.
-Implants.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.227
-Face-lifts
-Face-lifts.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.354
But you know, once in a while

14:14.437 --> 14:16.105
I get to help somebody,
which is nice though.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.858
There was this kid
the other day who came in,

14:18.941 --> 14:21.194
who had an accident
and he was badly burned.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.988
So there's that, too.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.490
I was just kidding. Sorry.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.824
-There you go.
-Thank you.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.619
-That is amazing.
-Don't worry.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.037
That work for you?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.331
-Wow. Yes.
-That do the trick?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.500
-'Cause that's all we got.
-I'm sorry. That's...

14:35.750 --> 14:36.709
Perfect.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.544
I only meant, like, a couple.
Thank you.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.629
-Cheers.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.175
So, what about your family?

14:44.967 --> 14:48.388
Uh... Well, I, um,
I don't have any siblings

14:48.513 --> 14:51.015
and my dad died a while back, so...

14:51.099 --> 14:55.061
I'm not sure where my mom is anymore
because we don't talk.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.105
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.232
It's fine. Um...

14:59.482 --> 15:01.526
-What about your family?
-Oh...

15:01.692 --> 15:05.863
My dad is in Texas
and my mom passed away, actually.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.490
-Sorry.
-So... But it's...

15:07.573 --> 15:09.409
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. It's okay.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.078
Well, we have something
in common, I guess.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.996
-Yeah, dead parents.
-Yeah.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.123
-Perfect.
-Great.

15:15.206 --> 15:19.419
-Let's cheers to that.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.897
...coordinated like that.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.482
-So you don't have Instagram.
-Nope.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.609
Wow. What about, um, Twitter?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.028
-Definitely not.
-No?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.322
Does anyone say anything smart
on Twitter ever?

15:48.406 --> 15:49.407
That's true.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.826
No way. Come on.
It's the worst.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.329
I mean, how am I supposed
to stalk you now?

15:55.705 --> 15:58.666
You're just gonna
have to do it in person.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.919
You know. Show up at my house,
the old-fashioned way.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.045
Send me a letter!

16:03.129 --> 16:04.422
-That would be nice.
-That would be nice.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.631
"Dearest..."

16:05.715 --> 16:07.592
"Yours truly."
Okay, I'll do that.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.093
I'd love that.
That'd touch my heart.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.553
That sounds nice.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.937
What?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.649
No, you just have a nice smile.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.320
-Okay.
-You do.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.948
All right, okay. Let's play a game.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.910
Um... Tell me something
you don't want me to know.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.787
-Hmm... Fun game. Okay.
-Yeah.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.748
Ooh. It's risky.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.417
Mmm...

16:41.792 --> 16:43.377
Yes. Um...

16:44.837 --> 16:46.047
I...

16:47.089 --> 16:48.466
hate this.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.220
I mean, um...

16:52.303 --> 16:54.347
Okay. I'm sorry.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.184
Not you, 'cause you seem cool,
but... No, I...

16:59.268 --> 17:01.729
I hate, like, dating.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.231
Mmm.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.483
You know? Everything about it.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.151
The, like...

17:08.361 --> 17:10.738
The awkward preamble.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.741
The, like, questions
and stuff. The, like...

17:14.492 --> 17:16.827
You know, texting.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.206
-The perfect projection.
-Yeah.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.667
Everything about it. Honestly.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.212
I don't know, I just think that, um...

17:27.380 --> 17:33.344
people who, like, believe in true love
are fucking idiots.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.305
-So dumb.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.015
-They are.
-They're so dumb.

17:38.224 --> 17:43.229
Like, we put all our hopes of, like,
finding happiness through someone else.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.189
And I just think that, like,

17:46.649 --> 17:48.985
I don't know,
maybe it's not meant for me,

17:50.069 --> 17:53.322
'cause I've, like, been alone so long,

17:53.864 --> 17:56.200
I'm actually pretty good at it.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.661
Fuck it.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.563
What?

18:26.689 --> 18:29.358
No, it's just...
Maybe it's a little too much.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.485
A little too fast.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.821
Oh, wow.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.034
I don't think I've ever heard a guy
say that before.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.329
Um, can I, uh...

18:41.495 --> 18:44.373
Can I get you something
to, like, drink?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.417
Or eat?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.295
No, just...

18:50.755 --> 18:51.964
Just you.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.141
Mmm.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.185
-Morning.
-Good morning.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.855
-Hello.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.609
-Coffee?

20:36.193 --> 20:37.945
Yeah, yeah, please.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.448
Just to, like, hide that morning breath.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.284
-Oh, God. Is it that bad?

20:43.451 --> 20:44.660
Oh, no.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.122
I'm not letting go of your hand.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.791
Get off. Get off.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.319
Oh, we had sex.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.196
Get that D!

21:21.822 --> 21:24.617
Somewhere between the second
and the third drink I was like,

21:24.950 --> 21:26.160
"Fuck it."

21:26.869 --> 21:28.621
And it was actually very freeing.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.999
My "Fuck it" advice
always works. Damn.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.543
Like, I wasn't even worrying
about how I looked

21:34.668 --> 21:37.338
or like, if I was taking too long.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.798
Okay!

21:38.923 --> 21:41.133
What's his Instagram?
I wanna stalk a little bit.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.760
Oh, he doesn't have one.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.345
-Say what?
-Yeah.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.513
Whatcha mean?

21:45.596 --> 21:48.390
Oh, no, see,
that's, that's shady.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.975
I'm sorry. Red flag.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.145
Okay. Whatever.
Stop raining on my sex parade.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.772
-Please?

21:54.897 --> 21:57.608
Oh, by the way, um, do you remember Paul?

21:57.983 --> 22:00.027
-Paul?
-He was our bartender.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.280
Oh, yeah. Aw, Paul!

22:03.405 --> 22:05.658
You know, I don't remember
why we stopped hooking up.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.201
He was a good guy.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.911
And a good kisser, too.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.247
Probably because you can't be tamed.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.915
-You need to roam free.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.208
That is true.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.378
All right, well, I gotta get back to work.
I love you.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.797
-Okay, love you more. Bye!
-Bye!

22:27.513 --> 22:30.391
You have to try these short ribs,
they're insane.

22:30.474 --> 22:34.061
Yeah, they look really good,
but I, um...

22:35.938 --> 22:37.523
I just don't eat animals.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.941
Oh!

22:39.024 --> 22:42.027
But... But keep eating.
Don't... Don't stop.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.321
In fact, I actually
want you to finish that plate.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.532
I dare you to finish that plate.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.871
-No!
-No, no... Why?

22:51.954 --> 22:53.664
-This is my favorite...
-But it does...

22:53.789 --> 22:55.291
...fucking short ribs.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.085
-Hey, listen, you have to eat the...
-I can't. You've ruined it for me now.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.253
Yeah.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.964
I'm gonna wash my hands,
I think.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.261
So have you, uh,
have you told anyone about me?

23:07.469 --> 23:09.680
Maybe.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.725
My best friend, Mollie.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.937
What did you tell
your best friend, Mollie?

23:17.229 --> 23:21.525
Um, that I met a cool guy.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.153
And I might kind of like him.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.405
-Just, like, a little bit.
-Uh-huh.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.199
-Tell me more about Mollie.
-Um...

23:29.366 --> 23:34.496
Well, we met, like, I think
it was like seven years ago,

23:34.622 --> 23:38.417
um, when I first moved here.
We worked together for a bit.

23:39.209 --> 23:42.171
Think you'd really get along.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.297
Hmm.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.928
I don't know about you,
but I am stuffed.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.431
I think we should dance.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.974
What?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.226
-Let's go. Come on.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.021
Yes. Yes, yes,
let's go, let's go.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.648
-I wanna see those moves.
-Okay.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.608
I wanna see those moves.
Get in the center here.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.860
-Let me turn this up.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.028
Here we go.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.741
Okay.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.117
Just a little sway.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.204
It's just a little two-step
for now.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.790
-It's all in the little moves.
-It's all in the face.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.792
It's in the shoulders.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.043
I mean, I can hop.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.170
Oh, the hip thrust!
Oh, my God.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.047
-Nah, you don't have...

24:25.130 --> 24:27.091
This. That.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.346
-Yeah. To me.
-Oh, no, no. Okay.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.056
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.016
Looks like we're salsa-ing.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.893
It's a salsa.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.731
-You are... moves.
-Oh, my God.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.404
-I have to. I have to.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.281
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
It was a really good picture.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.742
-You need to delete that.
-I will never delete that.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.124
We should go away somewhere.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.878
Do you want to?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.299
Uh, yeah.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.093
-Yeah?
-Yeah, um...

25:11.260 --> 25:12.720
Fuck it. Why not?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.305
I mean, where?

25:15.472 --> 25:16.849
Wherever.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.393
Somewhere... Somewhere nice.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.396
Somewhere... fun.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.986
Maybe it'll be a surprise.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.489
Fuck it.

25:32.573 --> 25:33.574
Yeah.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.493
Yeah.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.080
Um, I'm going away
with Steve for the weekend.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.082
What? Where?

25:42.166 --> 25:44.001
-It's a surprise.
-Hold on, Noa.

25:45.461 --> 25:49.173
Uh-uh. A surprise?
I don't like that.

25:49.256 --> 25:52.801
I'm just gonna go for it.
You said, "Fuck it," remember?

25:52.926 --> 25:56.013
Girl, you all dickmatized.
I haven't even seen this dude.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.098
Oh, shit, I totally forgot. Hold on.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.391
I'm sending you a picture of him.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.355
I mean, he looks cute,

26:05.439 --> 26:08.233
but I can barely even tell, you creep.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.778
Um, he is ridiculously cute.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.406
I'll, um, I'll text you once we get there
and let you know everything, okay?

26:14.490 --> 26:15.491
Okay, fine.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.327
Um, I'm excited for you.

26:18.452 --> 26:21.080
It's a straight girl's fantasy
come true, right?

26:21.163 --> 26:22.623
-Right?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.750
-I love you.
-I love you more.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.210
-Bye.
-Bye.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.092
-Hey.
-Hi.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.636
Sorry. My day ran long.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.347
Uh, listen, we're gonna have
to leave in the morning.

26:38.472 --> 26:41.016
I just checked the traffic
and it's a nightmare.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.893
So I figured maybe we go to my place

26:43.018 --> 26:44.978
and then, you know,
we leave first thing tomorrow.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.814
-Is that cool?
-Yeah. Okay.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.524
-Look at you.

26:49.733 --> 26:50.734
All right.

26:51.568 --> 26:52.611
I'm excited.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.385
-How you doing?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.512
-You all right?
-Yeah. Good.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.935
Fuck. I'm just gonna tell you.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.147
We're going to Cottage Grove.
That's the surprise.

27:28.814 --> 27:29.940
That's it.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.400
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.193
-That's the surprise?
-Yeah.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.987
What?
I've always wanted to go.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.155
You're not just saying that?

27:36.238 --> 27:37.948
I'm not just saying that.
No, I really have.

27:38.198 --> 27:42.077
I mean, I hate surprises,
so I'm kinda glad you told me.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.412
Yeah, it's gonna be good.

27:45.747 --> 27:46.915
Ugh. My cell isn't working.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.168
Yeah, the service is, um,

27:49.293 --> 27:51.503
shitty, but it's gonna
get better at my place.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.380
Cool.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.807
Fresh air, right?

28:46.016 --> 28:47.100
Yeah.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.727
It's amazing.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.062
Who knew?

29:16.880 --> 29:17.881
Oh.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.969
-Kinda disappointing.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.204
-Sizing me up?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.622
Oh. Yeah.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.040
Smells good.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.711
My sister got me that.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.672
Apparently she thinks I like sandalwood.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.966
-Okay.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.346
Do you have, um...

30:06.430 --> 30:07.764
Do you have Wi-Fi?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.392
Still no service.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.227
Fuck, must've gone out again.

30:12.769 --> 30:13.937
By the way,

30:14.313 --> 30:16.940
um, I'm making my own version

30:17.024 --> 30:18.942
of an old-fashioned with a twist.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.029
And, um, it's gonna have
some cherries in it.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.448
Very thoughtful.

30:46.803 --> 30:47.929
Cheers.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.474
Cheers.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.772
-Mmm.
-Mmm?

30:57.356 --> 30:58.648
That's really good.

30:58.732 --> 30:59.941
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.069
Notice any interesting flavors
in there?

31:02.652 --> 31:03.653
Um...

31:07.532 --> 31:08.909
-Peach?
-No.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.744
Close, very close.

31:10.994 --> 31:11.995
Um...

31:15.540 --> 31:17.084
-Apricot?
-Oh.

31:18.794 --> 31:19.795
-No.
-No?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.546
-What? Fuck.
-So close.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.757
-So close. Come on.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.261
Hmm.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.349
-Nectarine?
-Yes!

31:32.474 --> 31:34.184
-Really?
-Yeah, you got it.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.271
Nectarine.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.067
Um...

31:43.777 --> 31:47.114
Your, uh, your house is intimidating.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.325
You're all, like, you know,

31:51.868 --> 31:55.956
fancy cocktails, and I'm like
pancakes out of a bag.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.001
Yeah, but that's what I like about you.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.129
No pretending.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.048
Hmm.

32:08.343 --> 32:12.848
By the way, that, um...
The house in Cottage Grove,

32:12.931 --> 32:14.391
it has a hot tub.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.727
I don't know what you packed
in that big bag of yours,

32:18.979 --> 32:20.564
but adjustable jets,

32:20.689 --> 32:22.983
multiple lights, the whole ordeal.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.193
It's gonna be like
New Year's Eve in there.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.740
What? Sorry.

32:32.409 --> 32:35.203
You're gonna need a bathing suit.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.584
Noa. Noa, look at me.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.504
Why are you sitting so far away?

32:46.423 --> 32:47.632
Come here.

34:47.294 --> 34:48.503
Hey.

34:48.795 --> 34:49.796
Hi.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.216
How did you sleep?

34:53.466 --> 34:56.553
Yeah, good. Um...

34:58.263 --> 34:59.264
What...

35:00.473 --> 35:02.058
What happened?

35:06.229 --> 35:07.606
I drugged you.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.876
What, um...

35:30.295 --> 35:32.797
What's going on, Steve?

35:35.759 --> 35:37.844
I'm gonna tell you,
but you're gonna freak out.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.980
No, no. No, no, no, no.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.691
Hmm. Hmm...

35:53.068 --> 35:54.235
Mmm-mmm.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.615
Steve, can you
take these off, please?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.408
Can't do that.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.454
Can you take these off?

36:05.038 --> 36:06.414
-Can't do that.
-Steve.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.462
Take this off.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.424
I can't do that.

36:22.597 --> 36:26.559
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.812
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

36:28.895 --> 36:32.440
-No. No. This isn't happening.
-Yeah, it's happening.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.025
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.110
Yes, it is.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.197
Please, please, please, please.
This is a joke.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.533
Isn't it, Steve?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.243
Look,
why don't you just try to...

36:44.452 --> 36:45.787
-Noa.
-Don't! Don't! Don't!

36:45.870 --> 36:48.331
-I'm gonna stay right here.
-Don't come near me.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.167
-Do not come near me.
-I'm staying right here.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.545
Steve!

36:53.628 --> 36:56.464
-Noa.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.638
Come on, Noa, think. What...

37:05.932 --> 37:08.059
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

37:14.107 --> 37:15.108
Steve...

37:17.235 --> 37:18.862
are you gonna rape me?

37:23.032 --> 37:24.576
I'm not gonna rape you.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.582
I like you, Noa. I like you.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.709
All right?

37:32.792 --> 37:35.628
Now, I want you to listen to me
very carefully, okay?

37:36.546 --> 37:38.047
Are you listening to me?

37:38.131 --> 37:39.799
-Noa!

37:42.927 --> 37:44.053
There you are.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.850
I'm gonna tell you now.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.563
I'm gonna sell your meat.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.984
People pay me a lot of money for it.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.527
And your hair.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.029
And weird shit like that.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.239
It's a thing.

38:03.782 --> 38:04.783
So...

38:05.116 --> 38:07.368
I'm not...
I'm not gonna kill you...

38:09.245 --> 38:10.413
...uh, right away...

38:11.164 --> 38:13.708
Because the fresher the meat,
the better.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.336
So I'm gonna keep you alive
for as long as I can.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.173
Unless you act up.

38:21.174 --> 38:23.551
All right? But listen, until then,

38:23.760 --> 38:24.761
I'm gonna take care of you.

38:24.844 --> 38:25.929
I'm gonna cook for you.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.180
I'm actually a really good cook.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.389
You don't know it yet.

38:28.848 --> 38:32.101
As long as you don't act up,
nothing bad has to happen, all right?

38:32.185 --> 38:34.062
And look. This isn't bad, right?

38:34.187 --> 38:35.563
By the way, look at the sunset. Look...

38:38.441 --> 38:39.776
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

38:39.859 --> 38:42.195
-Come here. Come here.
-No! No! No!

38:44.739 --> 38:46.074
It's okay. It's okay.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.117
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.994
No! No!

39:03.466 --> 39:06.553
Be quiet. Calm down.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.810
Stop being so dramatic.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.522
It's okay.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.731
It's okay.

39:21.651 --> 39:22.944
There you go.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.170
Hi,
where the fuck are you?

39:41.254 --> 39:43.089
You're getting me all freaked out.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.426
Call me or text me.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.887
And I wanna hear where he took you.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.945
Trippin'.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.372
Help me!

40:18.416 --> 40:19.918
He's not here.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.670
Help me!

40:23.046 --> 40:26.716
Help me, please! Please!
Please, I'll do anything!

40:26.799 --> 40:29.177
I can't...
I can't help you.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.762
We're in the same boat.

40:33.389 --> 40:34.641
Fuck!

40:39.896 --> 40:41.397
Tell me your name.

40:45.735 --> 40:46.945
Noa.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.365
I'm Penny.

40:51.407 --> 40:54.035
I was in town visiting.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.621
Met Steve.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.877
Now I'm slowly...

41:03.586 --> 41:05.129
being eaten.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.716
How long have you been here?

41:09.342 --> 41:10.927
I've lost track.

41:11.386 --> 41:15.014
I'm not even sure what time of day it is,
to be honest.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.937
People have to be looking for you.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.355
Your... Your...

41:22.480 --> 41:24.357
Your friends, your family, the police.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.401
People have to be searching by now.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.320
The problem is,

41:29.404 --> 41:31.531
I don't have much family.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.743
Me neither.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.746
Makes sense.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.047
Are there others?

41:50.091 --> 41:53.761
Just one other
besides us, I think.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.724
Hey, Melissa, can you hear me?

42:06.441 --> 42:08.818
She's lost her mind.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.030
But I get it.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.283
No judgment here.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.585
We have to get out of here.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.275
Hmm...

43:00.078 --> 43:01.871
-Motherfucking...

43:14.550 --> 43:15.676
Okay.

43:42.578 --> 43:43.746
Fuck.

46:17.692 --> 46:18.776
Hey.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.236
How are you?

46:23.406 --> 46:25.491
Still angry.

46:27.076 --> 46:28.703
At least try the cake.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.038
I need to shower.

46:38.379 --> 46:39.588
Alone?

46:41.632 --> 46:45.094
It's a joke.
It was a stupid joke.

46:45.177 --> 46:47.179
I'm trying, you know?
I'm trying to...

46:47.430 --> 46:49.640
I'm trying to make you laugh
and it's not working.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.144
Can't you just give me one smile, please?

46:53.728 --> 46:54.729
Just one?

47:00.818 --> 47:02.111
Is that a yes?

47:06.824 --> 47:07.950
Okay.

47:10.328 --> 47:11.662
God, I mean,

47:11.746 --> 47:13.956
you're gonna have to
loosen up a little bit.

47:14.123 --> 47:16.125
I know things are a little different,

47:17.168 --> 47:18.878
but it's still me, you know?

47:18.961 --> 47:20.504
Still the guy I was at the bar that night.

47:20.629 --> 47:21.964
I meant everything I said to you.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.257
Just...

47:23.758 --> 47:26.927
no games, right?
No projections?

47:27.136 --> 47:28.763
Isn't that what you wanted?

47:40.483 --> 47:42.109
Are you gonna be good?

49:04.275 --> 49:06.569
-Bad girl.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.394
I don't wanna lose you

49:40.478 --> 49:43.981
I don't want you walking away

49:48.277 --> 49:49.820
We're so good together

49:49.904 --> 49:51.697
I can't move.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.073
I know.

49:53.574 --> 49:56.827
I gave you an epidural,
so you won't feel much.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.414
What are you doing?

50:01.290 --> 50:02.625
Hmm...

50:03.709 --> 50:05.044
I'm taking your ass.

50:07.630 --> 50:08.631
No.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.841
-Yes.
-No.

50:10.925 --> 50:12.635
You lost my trust, Noa.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.888
So there are gonna have to be
consequences.

50:16.180 --> 50:20.476
Don't leave me here
with my restless heart

50:20.601 --> 50:23.270
Please.

50:23.395 --> 50:26.649
I'm cauterizing your ass
so you won't be a bloody mess.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.944
-Please stop.
-Noa, it's gonna be okay.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.862
Hey, I'm a doctor, remember?

50:43.958 --> 50:45.125
Hey.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.170
Yo.

50:48.254 --> 50:49.838
Thanks for letting me stop by.

50:50.047 --> 50:53.133
Yeah, well, you didn't
really give me a choice, so...

50:53.217 --> 50:55.844
Boy, stop acting like
you didn't wanna see me.

50:55.928 --> 50:58.472
And I wanted
to see your face again.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.433
-You wanted to see my face?
-Yeah.

51:01.517 --> 51:02.601
You wanted
to see my face.

51:02.685 --> 51:03.686
I did.

51:03.811 --> 51:06.730
Mollie, you ain't never gonna change.
I still can't give you his info.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.399
-If I even had it.

51:08.482 --> 51:09.900
Come on, please?

51:09.984 --> 51:12.111
It's the only connection
that I have right now.

51:12.278 --> 51:13.404
Why don't you just go to the police?

51:13.487 --> 51:14.613
-The police.
-Yeah.

51:14.697 --> 51:15.906
And say what?

51:15.990 --> 51:17.908
That my best friend went away with a guy

51:17.992 --> 51:19.952
and extended her trip
and she's texting me,

51:20.035 --> 51:21.203
but I don't think it's her?

51:21.287 --> 51:22.871
Why not? She white, right?

51:22.955 --> 51:24.790
-Don't do that.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.418
No, I'm playin', I'm playin'.
Listen, I get it.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.254
I get it. But I could
lose my job, Mollie.

51:30.421 --> 51:32.756
Look, she wouldn't just
disappear like this, okay?

51:33.757 --> 51:35.259
Look, I can tell you
when they were here.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.343
Mollie.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.137
She told me
that you were their bartender

51:38.262 --> 51:40.097
and he must have used
a credit card, right?

51:41.015 --> 51:43.809
Look, even just his last name
would be a huge help.

51:44.643 --> 51:45.853
Please?

51:46.854 --> 51:48.063
What are you doing?

51:48.188 --> 51:49.440
She's doing the pouty lip.

51:49.523 --> 51:51.150
Don't do the pouty lip.
Don't do that.

51:51.275 --> 51:53.861
-Just think about it. For me?

51:54.820 --> 51:56.030
I'll think about it.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.699
-Can we shake on it?
-You remember that?

51:58.824 --> 52:00.534
-Do you remember it?
-Do I...

52:00.618 --> 52:01.994
Shit.

52:02.745 --> 52:04.663
-Hey.
-Get outta here.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.249
You lookin' good, by the way.

52:07.374 --> 52:08.375
-Me?
-Mmm-hmm.

52:08.459 --> 52:09.627
-It's the beard.
-Mmm.

52:09.710 --> 52:11.295
Yeah, it's connecting now.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.005
Got this new beard oil.

52:26.727 --> 52:28.020
Noa.

52:29.563 --> 52:30.939
How's your ass?

52:31.940 --> 52:33.067
Still gone.

52:33.817 --> 52:36.904
The pain meds are helping me
not care as much.

52:38.989 --> 52:42.409
He's so sweet, right?

52:46.580 --> 52:49.583
I just wanna hurt him, Penny.

52:51.293 --> 52:54.380
It's all I think about.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.844
I can't believe I slept with him.

53:01.303 --> 53:02.429
Wait,

53:02.596 --> 53:04.223
you fucked him?

53:05.683 --> 53:07.309
I never did.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.814
I don't think
any of the others did either.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.734
I am not slut-shaming you,
by the way.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.488
I'd say it's a compliment.

53:20.572 --> 53:22.533
I'm so fucking stupid.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.954
No. You're not.

53:29.623 --> 53:33.460
It is not our fault, Noa.

53:39.133 --> 53:40.175
It's...

53:40.884 --> 53:42.136
always...

53:42.594 --> 53:43.846
theirs.

54:26.722 --> 54:29.475
-What...

54:32.895 --> 54:33.896
The fuck?

55:14.520 --> 55:16.647
Get the fuck off me.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.106
Fuck.

55:55.519 --> 55:56.812
Wow, you did it.

55:56.979 --> 55:59.064
ANN'Mom, I made it!

56:21.753 --> 56:23.755
-Extra cherries.

56:24.423 --> 56:25.716
You've earned it.

56:28.260 --> 56:30.262
Oh, fuck.

56:31.179 --> 56:32.556
I'm so tired.

56:33.515 --> 56:36.602
Woke up at00 a. m. last night
going, "Really? Now?"

56:37.144 --> 56:39.396
I had to be up at00.

56:39.563 --> 56:40.772
Then you know you're not
going back to sleep.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.609
You're up fuckin' three hours later.
How are the meds?

56:45.485 --> 56:47.696
Great, great, great.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.239
Still in denial?

56:49.781 --> 56:52.117
Yeah. Well...

56:53.410 --> 56:55.913
Look, it's gonna take a little time,

56:56.496 --> 56:59.249
but eventually,
you're gonna learn to accept

56:59.625 --> 57:03.170
that things don't always turn out
the way you thought they would.

57:03.879 --> 57:05.380
You know, we all die.

57:05.505 --> 57:07.633
But it's really just how
we decide to go out.

57:08.967 --> 57:10.844
Why did you sleep with me, Steve?

57:19.186 --> 57:20.812
I told you, I, um...

57:23.482 --> 57:24.942
I told you, I liked you.

57:27.611 --> 57:29.154
Anyway, it was a mistake.

57:34.743 --> 57:37.537
All right, try to relax.

57:38.413 --> 57:40.457
Fear and stress isn't good for the meat.

58:21.540 --> 58:22.541
Penny?

58:23.458 --> 58:26.712
Penny, please, just answer already.

58:30.382 --> 58:31.591
Please, Penny.

58:34.219 --> 58:35.220
Penny!

58:35.637 --> 58:36.847
What do you want?

58:37.014 --> 58:38.181
Oh, fuck.

58:39.599 --> 58:40.600
Jesus.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.061
Now, was that so hard?

58:46.106 --> 58:48.525
I'm done, Noa.

58:51.653 --> 58:53.030
No, you're not.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.787
I don't even know who I am anymore.

59:06.752 --> 59:09.713
I hope he fucking chokes.

59:12.132 --> 59:15.761
And then he gets a fucking tapeworm.

59:18.305 --> 59:21.558
And it just eats him
from the inside, slowly.

59:22.142 --> 59:25.228
And that all his weirdo friends

59:26.354 --> 59:30.692
shit and puke out of their eyes

59:32.235 --> 59:34.821
till they all fucking die.

59:39.367 --> 59:41.119
You're such a sweetheart, Penny.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.375
Just...

59:49.628 --> 59:50.921
stay strong.

59:51.963 --> 59:52.964
Okay?

59:55.008 --> 59:56.676
-I'll get you those nuts.
-Thanks.

1:00:22.202 --> 1:00:23.245
Whatever you're selling,

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:24.329
I'm not interested.

1:00:24.412 --> 1:00:27.165
Oh, no. I'm not
selling anything. Sorry.

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:29.668
My name is Mollie, and...

1:00:29.751 --> 1:00:31.044
Do I know you?

1:00:31.545 --> 1:00:32.546
No.

1:00:32.671 --> 1:00:34.881
But I'm looking
for my friend, Noa,

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:36.675
and I was hoping you could help me.

1:00:36.925 --> 1:00:39.136
I think your husband might know her.

1:00:39.219 --> 1:00:41.388
It really should only take a minute.

1:00:49.020 --> 1:00:51.439
You do realize how strange
that sounds, right?

1:00:51.523 --> 1:00:53.567
Yes, I do, and, um...

1:00:54.025 --> 1:00:57.070
I don't really know
how to say this, but, um...

1:00:58.738 --> 1:01:01.324
I think she may have been
seeing your husband.

1:01:03.952 --> 1:01:05.453
What are you talking about?

1:01:14.713 --> 1:01:15.714
Hi.

1:01:18.258 --> 1:01:19.259
Hi.

1:01:28.143 --> 1:01:29.519
Do you need anything?

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:31.771
No. Thank you.

1:01:35.108 --> 1:01:36.109
Okay.

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:42.073
What does it taste like?

1:01:50.165 --> 1:01:51.166
Well...

1:01:53.293 --> 1:01:56.963
It depends on where it comes from
and how it's prepared.

1:02:00.425 --> 1:02:01.426
But...

1:02:06.848 --> 1:02:08.308
if it's done right...

1:02:12.187 --> 1:02:14.022
it's fucking exquisite.

1:02:15.982 --> 1:02:17.901
It's like nothing you've ever had before.

1:02:21.988 --> 1:02:22.989
Hmm.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:34.251
That's it?

1:02:58.024 --> 1:03:00.944
Go up to the playroom
while I make dinner, okay?

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:03.446
ANN'
Yeah! I got here first!

1:03:04.489 --> 1:03:05.740
Listen, um...

1:03:07.284 --> 1:03:10.745
I'm not even positive
that's my husband in the picture.

1:03:10.870 --> 1:03:12.998
You can't really see the face.

1:03:14.207 --> 1:03:17.502
Plus I saw him this morning
before he went to work, so...

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:21.381
-Here.
-Thanks.

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:24.592
Honestly, this is...
This is crazy.

1:03:26.886 --> 1:03:30.056
You should go to the police
if you're so worried about your friend.

1:03:31.641 --> 1:03:33.643
Um...

1:03:34.561 --> 1:03:36.062
Does he ever go out of town

1:03:36.187 --> 1:03:38.398
-for work or anything?
-No.

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:42.110
Well, they went away to Cottage Grove,
like, a week ago,

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:45.989
and I haven't heard from her
since then and I'm just...

1:03:46.072 --> 1:03:47.699
I don't know where that is.

1:03:50.452 --> 1:03:52.871
-I'm just worried, okay?
-Yeah, I understand.

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:56.041
I'm really sorry.

1:03:57.042 --> 1:03:58.376
-Um...

1:03:58.460 --> 1:04:01.838
That's my husband right now.
You need to leave, okay?

1:04:01.921 --> 1:04:05.842
I'm just desperate. Woman-to-woman,
maybe your husband has more information.

1:04:05.925 --> 1:04:08.136
I'm not trying to mess
anything up for anybody here.

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:09.220
I'm just trying to find my friend.

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:10.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:13.892
-Hello. Hi.
-Hey.

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:20.357
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:22.442
Nothing. This woman was just leaving.

1:04:23.443 --> 1:04:24.486
You're Steve, right?

1:04:24.861 --> 1:04:26.196
No, I'm Brendan.

1:04:26.446 --> 1:04:28.365
But you go by Steve, right?

1:04:28.990 --> 1:04:32.327
No. Just Brendan. Who are you?

1:04:33.286 --> 1:04:34.996
I'm Mollie. Um...

1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:39.417
My friend Noa, uh, I think
you know her, she's missing.

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:41.878
Noa. Um...

1:04:41.961 --> 1:04:44.297
No, I'm sorry, I... I don't.

1:04:44.381 --> 1:04:45.382
Um...

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:47.884
-Do you, honey?
-No, of course not.

1:04:48.385 --> 1:04:52.555
That's terrible. Yeah, I don't know,
I think you have the wrong house.

1:04:55.683 --> 1:04:58.812
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

1:05:00.230 --> 1:05:01.481
Okay.

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:03.691
-I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
-No.

1:05:03.775 --> 1:05:04.984
We're sorry
we couldn't help you.

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:06.653
Sorry about your friend.

1:05:10.615 --> 1:05:13.201
I'm just thinking, when's
the last time you saw her?

1:05:23.128 --> 1:05:24.421
Oh, it's you.

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:27.507
Mollie, right?

1:05:29.342 --> 1:05:30.427
Really shouldn't have done that.

1:05:55.326 --> 1:05:56.494
Noa said we'd get along.

1:05:56.578 --> 1:05:57.579
Fuck!

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:03.585
Let's see.

1:06:10.925 --> 1:06:11.926
So...

1:06:13.470 --> 1:06:15.597
why did you ask me what it tasted like?

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:20.935
Um...

1:06:21.269 --> 1:06:22.353
I don't know.

1:06:25.106 --> 1:06:28.109
I guess I was... curious.

1:06:29.694 --> 1:06:31.196
You were curious?

1:06:32.864 --> 1:06:34.407
You expect me to believe that?

1:06:36.993 --> 1:06:38.828
You can believe what you want.

1:06:44.667 --> 1:06:45.627
Okay.

1:06:51.925 --> 1:06:54.469
Let's have dinner
and we'll see how curious you are.

1:06:55.762 --> 1:06:58.890
Brought you some stuff.
Figured you might wanna...

1:07:00.308 --> 1:07:01.392
change.

1:07:17.283 --> 1:07:18.368
Mmm.

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:36.970
Fuck.

1:08:27.437 --> 1:08:29.647
-The boys go down okay?

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:32.775
Mmm-hmm. They asked for you.

1:08:46.372 --> 1:08:47.540
How was work?

1:08:47.707 --> 1:08:48.708
Good.

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:52.128
Actually, I'm gonna be late
tomorrow night.

1:08:53.171 --> 1:08:55.340
Lots to do now with the new product.

1:08:55.715 --> 1:08:58.259
Got some big clients expecting deliveries.

1:09:13.316 --> 1:09:14.859
I'm gonna take a shower.

1:09:15.026 --> 1:09:16.527
Good teamwork today.

1:12:57.331 --> 1:12:59.083
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna drug you.

1:13:00.042 --> 1:13:01.085
Again.

1:13:02.336 --> 1:13:03.796
You better not.

1:13:07.425 --> 1:13:08.426
Cheers.

1:13:11.178 --> 1:13:12.179
Cheers.

1:13:19.854 --> 1:13:21.731
So you mentioned
you were curious.

1:13:24.317 --> 1:13:25.318
Yeah.

1:13:25.484 --> 1:13:28.446
All right,
what do you wanna know?

1:13:31.157 --> 1:13:32.158
Well...

1:13:34.327 --> 1:13:35.328
Um...

1:13:37.705 --> 1:13:39.582
When did you first try it?

1:13:39.707 --> 1:13:41.167
-Um...

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:44.587
I was, um, 18 or 19.

1:13:45.755 --> 1:13:47.381
Nineteen, yeah.

1:13:47.548 --> 1:13:48.799
And, look...

1:13:50.092 --> 1:13:52.637
it wasn't an overnight thing,
you know?

1:13:52.762 --> 1:13:54.305
First, I was actually horrified.

1:13:54.388 --> 1:13:58.184
I mean, how could possibly be
capable of doing something like this?

1:13:58.267 --> 1:14:02.480
You know, I was a normal kid,
I had friends, I had a normal life,

1:14:03.648 --> 1:14:06.192
and now I gotta deal with this thing

1:14:06.901 --> 1:14:09.570
that I couldn't share with anybody.

1:14:09.695 --> 1:14:10.821
And that killed me.

1:14:11.656 --> 1:14:13.783
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

1:14:14.617 --> 1:14:18.120
I couldn't get the, um,
taste out of my mouth.

1:14:18.788 --> 1:14:19.997
The texture.

1:14:21.123 --> 1:14:24.627
I liked it. I liked the way
it made me feel.

1:14:25.586 --> 1:14:28.714
So I thought, "I gotta find out
if there's more out there," you know.

1:14:28.839 --> 1:14:31.968
"I can't possibly be the only person
that feels this way."

1:14:32.468 --> 1:14:34.387
And I wasn't.

1:14:35.304 --> 1:14:38.057
There's a whole community
of people that are devoted to this.

1:14:39.934 --> 1:14:44.397
And that's when my life
started making sense.

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:47.400
I mean, it's...

1:14:48.359 --> 1:14:51.153
It's a very powerful thing.

1:14:52.697 --> 1:14:55.408
This whole world,
if you only knew. It's, um...

1:14:58.160 --> 1:14:59.578
It's about giving.

1:15:01.664 --> 1:15:04.709
Giving yourself over to somebody.

1:15:06.127 --> 1:15:09.547
Becoming one
with somebody else, forever.

1:15:10.923 --> 1:15:11.924
And that's...

1:15:13.884 --> 1:15:15.511
That's a beautiful thing.

1:15:17.930 --> 1:15:19.223
That's surrender.

1:15:20.850 --> 1:15:21.976
That's love.

1:15:30.401 --> 1:15:32.820
And how many people
are in this community?

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:34.613
Not many.

1:15:36.282 --> 1:15:38.075
The one percent of the one percent.

1:15:39.285 --> 1:15:42.204
You know, there's nothing
these people can't afford, right?

1:15:42.288 --> 1:15:44.123
They want the one thing

1:15:44.665 --> 1:15:46.459
that no one else has

1:15:47.209 --> 1:15:48.544
or can get.

1:15:49.754 --> 1:15:51.630
And that's where I come in.

1:15:53.549 --> 1:15:54.967
I can get it for them.

1:15:57.511 --> 1:15:59.638
I made a name for myself.

1:16:03.017 --> 1:16:04.852
Is it only women that you eat?

1:16:06.771 --> 1:16:07.772
Yeah.

1:16:09.356 --> 1:16:10.357
Why?

1:16:11.067 --> 1:16:13.069
That's where the market is.

1:16:14.153 --> 1:16:16.072
Plus, women just taste better.

1:16:18.115 --> 1:16:19.116
So...

1:16:22.119 --> 1:16:24.080
I cooked us something.

1:16:25.498 --> 1:16:27.208
If you're open to trying it.

1:16:32.963 --> 1:16:34.090
Is it...

1:16:36.258 --> 1:16:37.384
Is it me?

1:16:40.096 --> 1:16:41.138
No.

1:16:43.682 --> 1:16:45.518
We'll have a bite together.

1:17:42.032 --> 1:17:44.451
This meal is about $30,000.

1:17:46.537 --> 1:17:47.872
That's crazy.

1:17:48.497 --> 1:17:50.583
Be a lot more if she was still alive.

1:17:51.458 --> 1:17:52.418
Hope.

1:17:54.086 --> 1:17:55.254
That was her name.

1:17:56.839 --> 1:17:57.840
Kinda funny.

1:17:59.508 --> 1:18:01.427
It's kinda funny.

1:18:02.011 --> 1:18:03.012
Stupid.

1:18:07.183 --> 1:18:09.101
It's not what I expected.

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:12.771
It's, um...

1:18:15.274 --> 1:18:16.984
It's indescribable.

1:18:42.468 --> 1:18:43.844
Thank you, Steve.

1:18:45.179 --> 1:18:46.805
You're welcome, Noa.

1:18:51.393 --> 1:18:53.354
You know how I knew
you were special?

1:18:56.899 --> 1:18:58.609
'Cause you're fucked up, too.

1:19:49.451 --> 1:19:51.161
All right. Let's go.

1:20:28.282 --> 1:20:29.283
Noa!

1:20:32.578 --> 1:20:33.787
Penny. Yeah?

1:20:34.455 --> 1:20:37.916
That definitely
didn't sound like Melissa.

1:20:39.543 --> 1:20:40.544
Yeah.

1:20:41.337 --> 1:20:43.047
Sounds like someone new.

1:20:53.140 --> 1:20:55.934
You know, the other night,

1:20:56.769 --> 1:20:58.354
I was thinking

1:20:59.313 --> 1:21:02.066
about how nice

1:21:02.649 --> 1:21:04.651
it's been to talk to you.

1:21:06.570 --> 1:21:10.574
But then I was like,
what if you're not real...

1:21:12.284 --> 1:21:16.497
...and I'm just going crazy?

1:21:18.665 --> 1:21:20.125
Like Melissa.

1:21:22.920 --> 1:21:28.384
But I feel like if I had
an imaginary friend,

1:21:30.052 --> 1:21:32.054
I wouldn't name her Noa.

1:21:33.555 --> 1:21:34.932
It'd be, like...

1:21:36.141 --> 1:21:37.559
Sean Connery.

1:21:51.198 --> 1:21:53.075
I wish I could see you.

1:22:01.250 --> 1:22:02.543
Me, too.

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.262
I have something for you.

1:22:16.390 --> 1:22:17.391
Go ahead.

1:22:18.642 --> 1:22:19.685
Open it.

1:22:45.544 --> 1:22:46.962
Do you like it?

1:22:51.175 --> 1:22:53.427
It's pink.

1:22:55.345 --> 1:22:56.805
I love it.

1:22:57.848 --> 1:22:58.849
Thank you.

1:22:59.475 --> 1:23:01.894
Maybe you can wear it
tonight and, uh,

1:23:03.395 --> 1:23:05.147
we can have dinner again.

1:23:07.316 --> 1:23:08.942
Yeah. Okay.

1:23:12.613 --> 1:23:14.156
I'll pick you up at00.

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:17.993
I have no idea what time it is.

1:23:18.076 --> 1:23:19.077
I know.

1:23:20.787 --> 1:23:21.788
Sure.

1:23:31.924 --> 1:23:33.550
Maybe you can freshen up.

1:25:09.938 --> 1:25:11.106
Well, hello.

1:25:12.274 --> 1:25:13.275
Hi.

1:25:28.123 --> 1:25:30.709
I see we've made it
to the dinner table.

1:25:30.792 --> 1:25:33.253
Yes, we have.

1:25:36.423 --> 1:25:37.716
Is, um...?

1:25:38.508 --> 1:25:40.218
Is this a date, Steve?

1:25:43.805 --> 1:25:45.015
Maybe it is.

1:26:05.994 --> 1:26:07.412
-Ooh.
-Well...

1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:09.706
All right.

1:26:11.166 --> 1:26:13.126
It's gonna be an interesting night.

1:26:13.418 --> 1:26:14.586
Yeah.

1:26:14.753 --> 1:26:15.754
It is.

1:26:16.088 --> 1:26:17.464
-Great.

1:26:19.424 --> 1:26:20.717
Let's get drunk.

1:26:21.968 --> 1:26:24.096
I was thinking about
what you said that night.

1:26:24.179 --> 1:26:26.223
About growing up alone and all.

1:26:27.683 --> 1:26:32.604
Made me realize nobody's
ever really cooked for you.

1:26:33.897 --> 1:26:35.232
And that made me sad.

1:26:37.442 --> 1:26:40.654
Everyone has to have
someone cook for them once.

1:26:42.197 --> 1:26:43.198
Pate.

1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:45.784
-Liver.

1:26:45.909 --> 1:26:47.494
And garlic and rosemary.

1:26:58.630 --> 1:27:00.382
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

1:27:00.507 --> 1:27:02.300
I do taste the garlic.

1:27:02.384 --> 1:27:04.928
Definitely. Whoa.

1:27:05.053 --> 1:27:08.432
You can make it next time.
Just the way you like it.

1:27:15.439 --> 1:27:16.773
Who's this?

1:27:19.067 --> 1:27:20.944
-This?
-Mmm.

1:27:24.614 --> 1:27:25.949
This is Melissa.

1:27:32.497 --> 1:27:33.665
Melissa.

1:27:41.089 --> 1:27:42.799
I mean, that's so boring.

1:27:43.425 --> 1:27:44.843
Isn't it?

1:27:45.802 --> 1:27:46.970
Like, she...

1:27:49.097 --> 1:27:51.683
She tastes so, you know, decadent...

1:27:52.100 --> 1:27:54.686
and her name's Melissa.

1:27:55.228 --> 1:27:56.229
Well...

1:27:57.856 --> 1:28:00.525
Thought you were gonna
say something, you know, like,

1:28:01.777 --> 1:28:02.778
Joy.

1:28:05.906 --> 1:28:07.699
Guess we finished all of Hope.

1:28:07.783 --> 1:28:10.368
Oh, no,
there's more Hope left.

1:28:16.333 --> 1:28:20.420
Did Melissa ever get a candlelit dinner?

1:28:42.192 --> 1:28:44.069
Welcome to my world.

1:28:46.446 --> 1:28:48.532
The clients wanna
feel closer to the women.

1:28:51.535 --> 1:28:54.746
They become a part of you in some way.

1:29:01.378 --> 1:29:02.712
There's Melissa.

1:29:04.381 --> 1:29:07.843
And no, she never had
a candlelight dinner.

1:29:25.986 --> 1:29:27.612
Where is my stuff?

1:29:35.287 --> 1:29:36.997
With me, I guess.

1:29:52.929 --> 1:29:54.347
All right, come on.

1:29:55.140 --> 1:29:56.474
There's more to eat.

1:30:01.605 --> 1:30:02.898
We never did make it

1:30:02.981 --> 1:30:04.524
to Cottage Grove, did we?

1:30:06.109 --> 1:30:07.319
That's too bad.

1:30:10.405 --> 1:30:12.240
It's really serene out there.

1:30:12.949 --> 1:30:16.119
Really makes me wanna hug a tree.

1:30:17.245 --> 1:30:21.666
Anyway, who knows?
Maybe we could still go.

1:30:24.294 --> 1:30:27.255
Okay, so this is, uh,

1:30:28.214 --> 1:30:29.257
breast meat.

1:30:29.716 --> 1:30:32.928
And it's, um, it's really nice.

1:30:33.136 --> 1:30:35.889
It's fatty and subtle.

1:30:36.139 --> 1:30:37.265
I don't know.

1:30:37.515 --> 1:30:39.351
It might even be familiar.

1:30:42.270 --> 1:30:43.271
What?

1:30:43.355 --> 1:30:44.856
-No, it's...
-Is it...?

1:30:44.940 --> 1:30:46.399
No, it's, uh...

1:30:47.692 --> 1:30:49.069
It's just stupid.

1:30:49.152 --> 1:30:51.279
-No, no, no, go ahead.
-No, I can't.

1:30:51.363 --> 1:30:52.364
Come on.

1:30:53.073 --> 1:30:54.407
You gotta tell me.

1:30:54.824 --> 1:30:56.534
No, it's just, um...

1:30:57.577 --> 1:31:00.163
You saved the breast till last.

1:31:08.004 --> 1:31:09.506
Oh, my God.

1:31:09.589 --> 1:31:10.590
That was, um...

1:31:11.132 --> 1:31:12.592
That's good.

1:31:12.759 --> 1:31:16.846
This is really nice, Steve. You know?

1:31:18.431 --> 1:31:23.186
You're right, no one has ever
cooked for me, so...

1:31:24.104 --> 1:31:27.315
It's not quite
how I pictured it,

1:31:27.399 --> 1:31:29.901
but, you know, it's... It is nice.

1:31:29.985 --> 1:31:30.986
Yeah.

1:31:31.653 --> 1:31:33.697
She's got better tits than me.

1:31:36.032 --> 1:31:37.492
You're not disagreeing?

1:31:37.575 --> 1:31:40.704
-No, it's not...
-Thanks, Steve.

1:31:40.787 --> 1:31:42.706
-I wasn't saying that.
-Thanks a lot, Steve.

1:31:49.212 --> 1:31:50.463
What's...?

1:31:59.806 --> 1:32:02.851
-Um...

1:32:10.108 --> 1:32:11.359
Sorry.

1:32:12.235 --> 1:32:13.653
Sorry, it's just...

1:32:16.156 --> 1:32:18.158
Um, it's just...

1:32:20.243 --> 1:32:22.328
It is really nice.

1:32:24.914 --> 1:32:25.915
And it's...

1:32:27.250 --> 1:32:28.209
It's...

1:32:28.793 --> 1:32:31.713
all just so confusing.

1:32:34.966 --> 1:32:37.385
And I can't quite process...

1:32:43.933 --> 1:32:45.685
...'cause I feel awful.

1:32:50.398 --> 1:32:51.483
I feel...

1:32:53.359 --> 1:32:54.694
awful.

1:32:57.864 --> 1:32:58.865
'Cause...

1:33:01.201 --> 1:33:03.578
'Cause I don't... I don't feel awful.

1:33:08.625 --> 1:33:09.667
Fuck.

1:33:09.834 --> 1:33:11.252
Hey, come here.

1:33:12.962 --> 1:33:14.964
Noa.

1:33:16.382 --> 1:33:17.383
Hey.

1:33:19.094 --> 1:33:20.345
It's okay.

1:33:23.348 --> 1:33:25.433
-It's okay.

1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:36.903
It's all gonna be okay.

1:33:42.867 --> 1:33:44.577
You're just different.

1:33:46.746 --> 1:33:49.874
And I knew it
from the moment I met you.

1:34:22.198 --> 1:34:24.492
I forgot to handcuff you.

1:34:26.202 --> 1:34:28.246
Yeah.

1:34:30.039 --> 1:34:31.040
You did.

1:34:37.255 --> 1:34:38.840
Do you wanna dance?

1:34:46.890 --> 1:34:48.016
Yeah.

1:34:52.562 --> 1:34:53.730
Yeah, I do.

1:37:22.337 --> 1:37:23.796
Fuck!

1:37:32.347 --> 1:37:33.723
You fuck!

1:37:35.016 --> 1:37:36.309
Oh, God!

1:37:42.690 --> 1:37:43.816
Come on, come on.

1:37:46.319 --> 1:37:47.987
You fucking bitch.

1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:56.829
-Hurry.

1:37:56.913 --> 1:38:00.041
Goddamn it, Noa!

1:38:01.918 --> 1:38:04.295
You fucking bitch!

1:38:04.379 --> 1:38:06.381
I'm gonna cut your heart out!

1:38:11.511 --> 1:38:12.929
Oh, my God, Mollie.

1:38:13.638 --> 1:38:16.140
-Are you okay? Are you okay?

1:38:17.058 --> 1:38:20.395
I'm so sorry.
Hey, come on, come on. Okay.

1:38:20.561 --> 1:38:22.313
-Oh, fuck.
-Give me your hand.

1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:23.564
What is wrong with you?

1:38:23.648 --> 1:38:25.858
I can't tell you right now, but I will.

1:38:26.025 --> 1:38:27.693
Put those on. I'll be right back!

1:38:27.777 --> 1:38:28.778
Where are you going?

1:38:31.656 --> 1:38:34.033
Penny? Oh, my God, Penny!
Are you okay?

1:38:34.158 --> 1:38:36.327
It's so good to finally see you.
Are you okay?

1:38:36.452 --> 1:38:37.662
Mollie! Mollie!

1:38:37.829 --> 1:38:39.122
-Noa?
-Mollie, come help!

1:38:39.288 --> 1:38:41.541
-Noa? Oh, my God.
-Come on, we gotta go.

1:38:49.590 --> 1:38:51.050
-Are you okay?
-Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1:38:51.134 --> 1:38:52.176
You good?

1:38:59.976 --> 1:39:01.394
Oh, shit!

1:39:01.519 --> 1:39:02.854
Oh, fuck.

1:39:53.488 --> 1:39:55.490
Mollie. Mollie.

1:40:00.495 --> 1:40:01.496
-Mollie.

1:40:08.586 --> 1:40:10.129
-Come here.
-No. No!

1:40:10.296 --> 1:40:12.089
Where do you think
you're going, Noa, huh?

1:40:12.173 --> 1:40:13.382
Where do you think you're going?

1:40:13.549 --> 1:40:15.009
Think you're going somewhere?

1:40:15.092 --> 1:40:16.469
You're not gonna fucking leave.

1:40:18.429 --> 1:40:20.348
Fuck.

1:40:43.496 --> 1:40:45.414
No!

1:40:49.585 --> 1:40:51.712
We gotta get
the fuck outta here.

1:41:03.516 --> 1:41:04.684
-Fuck.

1:41:12.858 --> 1:41:15.528
Naw, son, this shit is creepy as fuck.

1:41:16.779 --> 1:41:19.156
I must've taken a wrong turn back there.

1:41:20.324 --> 1:41:22.451
This some bullshit.

1:41:24.996 --> 1:41:26.163
Whoa.

1:41:28.416 --> 1:41:29.875
Come on, Mollie.

1:41:30.918 --> 1:41:32.336
Where you at?

1:41:32.461 --> 1:41:33.921
How the fuck did he get you?

1:41:34.088 --> 1:41:37.675
I was trying to find you,
but I found him.

1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:39.260
I knew shit was off.

1:41:39.510 --> 1:41:42.555
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

1:41:42.722 --> 1:41:44.515
You guys are so cute.

1:41:44.599 --> 1:41:46.642
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit.

1:41:46.726 --> 1:41:48.519
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1:41:48.686 --> 1:41:51.063
We gotta get up.
I'm gonna pick you up.
