Previously on <i>House of Lies</i> :

00:08.773 --> 00:11.005
You don't trust us?

00:11.006 --> 00:12.273
That's all right,
I don't trust you, either.

00:12.348 --> 00:13.880
But you do like me.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.547
Marissa, I can get you the
whole McClintock media group.

00:15.548 --> 00:18.347
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

00:18.348 --> 00:19.413
It's McClintock.

00:19.414 --> 00:21.213
Hand-delivered by Judas.

00:21.214 --> 00:22.880
I will not fuck this up.
This would be huge

00:22.881 --> 00:24.113
for Kaan and Associates.

00:24.114 --> 00:25.380
<i>Just out of curiosity,</i>

00:25.381 --> 00:26.847
which associate am I?

00:26.848 --> 00:28.080
Did you see the redhead?
Which one is that?

00:28.081 --> 00:29.380
She's the one
I told you about. Caitlin?

00:29.381 --> 00:30.647
She has a boyfriend.

00:30.648 --> 00:32.380
Oh, that's fine.
Apparently, you have a wife?

00:32.381 --> 00:34.180
Oh, yeah, no.
I wasn't, uh...

00:34.181 --> 00:35.613
You're smart and
you're attractive.

00:35.614 --> 00:37.080
But no one's gonna
hand you anything.

00:37.081 --> 00:39.113
My sneakers will
absolutely fuckin' work.

00:39.114 --> 00:40.280
Decision's been made.

00:40.281 --> 00:41.847
All the capital stays
with the clothing line,

00:41.848 --> 00:43.713
and Lukas gets 100%

00:43.714 --> 00:45.247
<i>of nothing but a shoe.</i>

00:45.248 --> 00:48.080
<i>Marty's probably</i>
<i>getting a bikini wax</i>

00:48.081 --> 00:49.980
for his date with Dre.
'Cause he so wants

00:49.981 --> 00:51.113
<i>to fuck that guy.</i>

00:51.114 --> 00:52.480
You know, what
we're about to do,

00:52.481 --> 00:53.981
<i>there's no coming</i>
<i>back from that.</i>

I bet you never been to
a party like this before,

01:31.372 --> 01:32.538
have you, Marty Kaan?

01:32.539 --> 01:33.971
- I have not.
- Yeah.

01:33.972 --> 01:36.238
Dancing bitches are great and
all, but this right here?

01:36.239 --> 01:37.671
This shit never gets old.

01:37.672 --> 01:39.605
All right!

01:39.606 --> 01:40.972
Whoa, whoa.

01:43.439 --> 01:45.305
Check out that!
Hey, he got

01:45.306 --> 01:47.071
his balls taken out
about two weeks ago.

01:47.072 --> 01:48.605
He ain't even got
his Neuticles yet,

01:48.606 --> 01:49.638
and look at him go.

01:49.639 --> 01:51.071
I'm proud as hell, though.

01:51.072 --> 01:52.805
Manny Ribera, you do
your thing, man.

01:52.806 --> 01:53.938
Establish dominance!

01:53.939 --> 01:55.071
Whoa, man.
Knock that shit off.

01:55.072 --> 01:56.805
A tip.
What do you mean, knock it off?

01:56.806 --> 01:58.771
He liked it, you liked it, man,
don't you, man?

01:58.772 --> 02:00.438
Don't you like it?
Stand still.

02:00.439 --> 02:01.805
Don't move. Let him finish.

02:01.806 --> 02:02.771
Oh, he-he finishes?

02:02.772 --> 02:03.871
Hell, yeah, all over the place.

02:03.872 --> 02:06.238
Come on, man,
you know you like it.

02:06.239 --> 02:07.471
Hey, anyway, you better not

02:07.472 --> 02:09.437
be skimping on the champagne,
you cheap motherfucker, you.

02:09.439 --> 02:10.905
Motherfucker, does it look like

02:10.906 --> 02:12.305
I skimped on anything in here?

02:12.306 --> 02:13.705
Hey, speaking of...

02:13.706 --> 02:15.771
To the Soldier sneaker line.
All right.

02:15.772 --> 02:18.405
The brand expansion that's gonna
take DollaHyde to the next level.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.471
I'll drink to that.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.471
Sky's the limit, baby.

02:20.472 --> 02:21.472
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

02:25.072 --> 02:26.271
Mmm...

02:26.272 --> 02:30.505
That is some
exquisite-tasting bullshit.

02:30.506 --> 02:31.871
Just think:

02:31.872 --> 02:33.338
all of this for a product line

02:33.339 --> 02:35.838
guaranteed never to exist.

02:35.839 --> 02:39.705
Well... welcome to the DollaHyde
Trojan horse party.

02:39.706 --> 02:42.938
That shiny object
keeping Lukas distracted

02:42.939 --> 02:47.205
while he unknowingly cedes
complete control of his company.

02:47.206 --> 02:48.971
Duplicitous?

02:48.972 --> 02:50.771
You're goddamn right!

02:50.772 --> 02:53.271
Morally questionable?

02:53.272 --> 02:54.871
I guess.

02:54.872 --> 02:56.871
But at the end of the day,

02:56.872 --> 02:59.005
with his big baller
drug-dealing ties

02:59.006 --> 03:01.405
and his ball-less
leg-humping dog,

03:01.406 --> 03:03.805
Lukas is a corporate cancer.

03:03.806 --> 03:05.772
So Lukas has got to go.

03:09.801 --> 03:11.466
Yep.

03:11.467 --> 03:12.800
It's a sneaker.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.000
I like it.

03:14.001 --> 03:15.733
It's an interesting colorway.

03:15.734 --> 03:17.733
Looks like they pulled
a little inspiration

03:17.734 --> 03:20.633
from the, uh, Nike Dunk Highs.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.567
I did my homework.

03:24.301 --> 03:26.101
That's what you were
looking for, right?

03:32.167 --> 03:34.866
I've been told my, um...

03:34.867 --> 03:36.166
good-natured playfulness

03:36.167 --> 03:38.500
sometimes comes across
as mean-spirited.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.033
Oh, there he is.

03:40.034 --> 03:41.633
Uh, excuse me, I'm just
gonna give my gift

03:41.634 --> 03:44.100
to Lukas.
You brought a gift?

03:44.101 --> 03:46.133
Uh, yeah.
It's a party.

03:46.134 --> 03:47.833
I always bring
a gift to a party.

03:47.834 --> 03:49.666
Janet Guggenheim
didn't raise no fool.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.300
Normally, I'd bring

03:51.301 --> 03:52.633
scented votive candles,
you know?

03:52.634 --> 03:53.933
But that hardly
seemed appropriate.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.833
Hardly.
Then I was thinking maybe

03:55.834 --> 03:56.966
a nice bottle of champagne,

03:56.967 --> 03:59.466
but I didn't want to be
the ignorant white guy

03:59.467 --> 04:01.300
whose only knowledge of black
culture comes from rap videos.

04:01.301 --> 04:03.533
We all know it's
much more than that.

04:03.534 --> 04:04.500
It's a lot more than that.

04:04.501 --> 04:05.800
Yeah.
What did you bring?

04:05.801 --> 04:06.933
Box of chocolates.

04:06.934 --> 04:07.933
Are you...
Bull's-eye.

04:07.934 --> 04:08.900
...are you serious?

04:08.901 --> 04:10.500
Uh, yeah. Why?

04:10.501 --> 04:13.866
You brought a box of chocolates
as a gift...

04:13.867 --> 04:15.134
for a black man?

04:17.634 --> 04:18.700
Hold on. That's....

04:18.701 --> 04:19.800
that's not a thing.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.333
That wouldn't be a...

04:21.334 --> 04:23.366
Oh, my God,
that's a thing, isn't it?

04:23.367 --> 04:24.733
Please tell me
you're kidding, Doug.

04:24.734 --> 04:25.866
Uh, no.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.566
What kind of chocolates
did you bring?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.233
Dark chocolates.
Jesus Christ, Doug!

04:29.234 --> 04:30.733
No! My God!
It's the worst kind.

04:30.734 --> 04:32.400
Chocolates, of course...

04:32.401 --> 04:33.666
All right.
Hey, listen, could you not...

04:33.667 --> 04:35.400
Marty's not gonna hear
about it from me.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.100
Thank you. Thank you.
But I-I can't guarantee that...

04:37.101 --> 04:38.766
Oh, my God, chocolate,
they would never...

04:38.767 --> 04:42.233
He actually thinks
that's a thing.

04:42.234 --> 04:44.467
See? Playful.

04:58.367 --> 04:59.500
Oh, ah...

04:59.501 --> 05:00.467
Mmm...

05:01.501 --> 05:03.500
Mmm.

05:03.501 --> 05:04.700
Yep.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.733
Feel good?

05:06.734 --> 05:08.666
Bet that shit feels real good,

05:08.667 --> 05:10.266
huh, Marty?

05:10.267 --> 05:11.966
Lukas said you should
take them prototypes

05:11.967 --> 05:12.966
out for a stroll.

05:12.967 --> 05:14.200
Get a real feel for the product.

05:14.201 --> 05:15.733
It's his night, Marty.

05:15.734 --> 05:17.533
It is his night.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.014
Yeah. All right.
Take a little stroll.

05:24.901 --> 05:26.966
I-I can actually do
this part by myself.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.433
Lukas said not to let 'em
out of my sight.

05:28.434 --> 05:31.600
Shit's valuable, Marty.

05:31.601 --> 05:33.033
Okay, got it.
Got it.

05:33.034 --> 05:34.466
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

05:34.467 --> 05:36.566
A little Cuervo Gold on top.

05:36.567 --> 05:37.966
Yes...
Oh...

05:37.967 --> 05:40.166
Came up with this little
concoction back in college.

05:40.167 --> 05:42.200
I call it "Attica, 1971,"

05:42.201 --> 05:44.301
because chaos and riots
are known to ensue.

05:45.267 --> 05:46.666
Oh...
Oh!

05:46.667 --> 05:47.933
For those who like their drinks

05:47.934 --> 05:49.200
historically pretentious.

05:49.201 --> 05:51.100
You hit it again,
new guy. Well done.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.733
Well, I can make you
something else.

05:52.734 --> 05:54.766
Oh, no, I won't be
drinking tonight.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.433
One little nervous breakdown

05:56.434 --> 05:57.800
and suddenly you're sober?

05:57.801 --> 05:59.866
Gotta stay sharp, boss lady.

05:59.867 --> 06:02.000
But you, by all means, please,
please, please drink. Oh, can I?

06:02.001 --> 06:02.900
Yeah.
Thanks.

06:02.901 --> 06:04.933
I mean, how else will slutty Jeannie
make an appearance tonight?

06:04.934 --> 06:06.500
Mmm, mmm!

06:06.501 --> 06:07.733
Oh, is it delicious?

06:07.734 --> 06:09.533
So good, Clyde.
Is that really good?

06:09.534 --> 06:11.000
It's so good.
Alcohol ends up being really delicious?

06:11.001 --> 06:13.500
Mmm!
You guys are fucked-up.

06:13.501 --> 06:14.700
I like it.

06:14.701 --> 06:15.966
You make a hell
of a drink, Twenty.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.033
Thank you.
Hmm, why would you

06:17.034 --> 06:19.533
call Ghetto Clark Kent "Twenty"?

06:19.534 --> 06:21.033
Will's nickname in college.

06:21.034 --> 06:22.333
You haven't heard this story?

06:22.334 --> 06:24.300
Ooh... Oh, oh, you'll love this.
This is great.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.833
No, no, it's true.
I feel like I won't love it.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.166
You will, you will.

06:27.167 --> 06:28.600
All right, so they were, uh...

06:28.601 --> 06:31.033
they were doing this...
this shoot for <i> Perfect 10</i>

06:31.034 --> 06:32.100
at my school.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.133
"Perfect Tens of the Big Ten,"
some shit like that.

06:34.134 --> 06:35.500
Anyway, later that night,

06:35.501 --> 06:37.933
some of the girls show up
at this party we were having,

06:37.934 --> 06:39.600
one thing led to another, and...

06:39.601 --> 06:42.267
Will had a threesome
with two Perfect Tens.

06:44.101 --> 06:45.233
Oh, him?
He did that

06:45.234 --> 06:46.600
with two Perfect...
Oh, my God!

06:46.601 --> 06:48.033
Fuck! Oh, my...
That never happened.

06:48.034 --> 06:49.966
Oh, yeah?
Because it did.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.133
Yes, it did.
Fuck that.

06:51.134 --> 06:52.133
You believe that story?

06:52.134 --> 06:53.233
Coming from this?

06:53.234 --> 06:54.766
Yeah, I do.
Oh...

06:54.767 --> 06:55.933
I've had a threesome before.

06:55.934 --> 06:57.500
That's why we call you Six.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.733
Oh!
Oh!

06:58.734 --> 06:59.866
Oh, shit!

06:59.867 --> 07:01.833
Look at Jeannie, comin' strong!

07:01.834 --> 07:04.800
Oh... why don't you calm
the fuck down, new guy, huh?

07:04.801 --> 07:06.366
Actually, Clyde,

07:06.367 --> 07:09.033
I've been at K&A
for a couple of months.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.566
You've been here, what, a week?

07:10.567 --> 07:11.566
New guy?

07:11.567 --> 07:12.866
Okay.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.233
Uh-uh.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.666
That's not how we roll.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.100
You know what?

07:17.101 --> 07:18.300
I'm gonna do a lap.

07:18.301 --> 07:20.733
Enjoy your little
drinks, all right?

07:20.734 --> 07:22.734
I think he likes me.

07:28.801 --> 07:30.534
Thank you.
The fuck out.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.034
Go, man.

07:36.867 --> 07:38.433
You know, I don't
remember seeing you

07:38.434 --> 07:39.766
at the DollaHyde offices.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.233
That's 'cause I don't
work for DollaHyde.

07:41.234 --> 07:43.533
No?

07:43.534 --> 07:44.700
Work for Lukas?

07:44.701 --> 07:46.634
Yeah, that's right.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.400
You know, I was
just wondering, um...

07:50.401 --> 07:53.133
where on the gangster
hierarchy scale

07:53.134 --> 07:55.766
does, uh, "shoe bodyguard" fit?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.266
I mean, what are we looking at?

07:57.267 --> 07:58.400
Drug dealer, killer...

07:58.401 --> 07:59.733
Or is it killer, drug dealer,

07:59.734 --> 08:01.701
thug, shoe...

08:02.801 --> 08:05.466
I'm fuckin' with you.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.000
Come on, man.
What the fuck is this?

08:07.001 --> 08:09.033
Lukas wanted me to
let you know, he knows.

08:09.034 --> 08:10.066
He knows what?

08:10.067 --> 08:11.633
He knows everything.

08:11.634 --> 08:13.300
About the sneaker line
being some bullshit.

08:13.301 --> 08:15.100
About... yeah, about
how you and Dre

08:15.101 --> 08:16.666
are trying to push him
out of his own company.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.733
Jesus, come on, listen...
Uh-huh, that's right.

08:17.734 --> 08:21.300
Look, I always knew
that Lukas was a little...

08:21.301 --> 08:23.566
I'll be nice and say "off."

08:23.567 --> 08:24.966
But this?
Marty...

08:24.967 --> 08:26.100
This is some President Nixon

08:26.101 --> 08:28.133
paranoid-level type shit.

08:28.134 --> 08:29.234
Mmm... hmm.

08:30.293 --> 08:31.933
See, this is my favorite
part, right here.

08:31.934 --> 08:33.832
See just how long a
bullshitter will keep

08:33.833 --> 08:35.601
bullshitting until
he starts to lose it.

08:36.467 --> 08:37.366
Are you fucking...

08:37.366 --> 08:39.101
What, are we supposed
to fight now?

08:40.866 --> 08:41.765
I'm just playin'.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.600
Man, fuck you.

08:43.601 --> 08:44.833
Relax, Marty.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.966
I'm here because Lukas has
a proposition for you.

08:46.967 --> 08:48.600
He wants your help.

08:48.601 --> 08:50.133
Well, outside of
a good therapist

08:50.134 --> 08:52.501
to recommend, I can't help him.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.033
You know what? Yeah.

08:56.034 --> 08:57.500
Let's go talk to Lukas.

08:57.501 --> 08:59.033
Let's go.
All right, all right, all right, Marty.

08:59.034 --> 09:00.300
You say it's all bullshit,
it's all bullshit.

09:00.301 --> 09:01.500
I'll pass it along.

09:01.501 --> 09:02.766
But I can guarantee you

09:02.767 --> 09:04.866
that Lukas will pay
a hell of a lot more

09:04.867 --> 09:05.933
than whatever Dre is paying.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.666
Do you hear me?
So you still want

09:07.667 --> 09:09.133
to stick with
your story or what?

09:09.134 --> 09:10.466
You still want
to stick with yours?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.733
<i>I keep blowing it with Jeannie.</i>

09:12.734 --> 09:14.966
I mean, I don't know what else I can do.
Yeah.

09:14.967 --> 09:17.666
I have worked harder at this
than anything in my entire life.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.366
Where am I?

09:19.367 --> 09:21.533
I hear you.

09:21.534 --> 09:23.534
I don't know.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.866
Maybe I'm just not
cut out for this job.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.166
No, no.
God, that would suck.

09:29.167 --> 09:32.166
Hey, but this is nice, right?

09:32.167 --> 09:33.733
Yeah...

09:33.734 --> 09:36.400
Two coworkers having
a nice smoke.

09:36.401 --> 09:39.333
And getting to know each other.

09:39.334 --> 09:40.900
Learning about
each other's dreams,

09:40.901 --> 09:42.833
- hopes, fears...
- Fuck is wrong with you, man?

09:42.834 --> 09:45.033
Lukas told you to keep an eye on him.
Look, man, I did.

09:45.034 --> 09:47.433
The fucking dog must've got into
something when I wasn't looking.

09:47.434 --> 09:49.300
Yeah, you breaking this shit
to him after the party.

09:49.301 --> 09:50.700
All right, cool.
And I'm gonna be

09:50.701 --> 09:52.033
finding something
to wrap your ass in.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.033
You ain't gonna wrap
any damn thing.

09:53.034 --> 09:54.566
No, no, no, no, no.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.833
No! No, you're right.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.366
I am Caitlin Hobart,

09:58.367 --> 10:00.900
and I have never
failed at anything,

10:00.901 --> 10:02.700
and I am just gonna go in there,

10:02.701 --> 10:04.066
and I'm gonna work
twice as hard.

10:04.067 --> 10:05.566
That a girl, okay.
Hey, you know what?

10:05.567 --> 10:06.700
Excuse me for just one second?

10:06.701 --> 10:09.401
Um, I-I, um, be right back.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.201
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.133
Where you been?

10:39.134 --> 10:41.234
I was just hanging out
with Slim Walter.

10:42.067 --> 10:43.233
You know Slim Walter.

10:43.234 --> 10:44.466
No.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.433
Yeah, Slim Walter's the guy

10:46.434 --> 10:48.466
you sent to me,
see if I was gonna sell you out.

10:48.467 --> 10:50.266
It's that obvious, huh?

10:50.267 --> 10:51.500
It might've worked
on anybody else.

10:51.501 --> 10:53.100
You know, don't beat
yourself up about it.

10:53.101 --> 10:54.500
Said you held you own
under pressure.

10:54.501 --> 10:55.533
He was impressed.

10:55.534 --> 10:57.666
Wait, what?
Slim Walter was impressed?

10:57.667 --> 10:59.233
Fucking-A!

10:59.234 --> 11:00.600
Hey, uh, bartender!

11:00.601 --> 11:01.800
Round of drinks for everybody.

11:01.801 --> 11:02.900
I fucking impressed Slim Walter.

11:02.901 --> 11:04.466
Nigga, calm down, all right?

11:04.467 --> 11:06.566
I needed to see if you were
just about the money.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.866
Do you know how badly I could've
soaked you by now, Dre?

11:08.867 --> 11:10.500
I could've fucking taken you

11:10.501 --> 11:11.466
to the goddamn cleaners.

11:11.467 --> 11:12.666
And you try this shit with me?

11:12.667 --> 11:13.800
Motherfucker.

11:13.801 --> 11:15.300
I don't know you like that yet.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.833
Oh, okay.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.233
I hired you to do a job.

11:18.234 --> 11:20.033
So, you let me know

11:20.034 --> 11:21.600
when you're done
whining about this.

11:21.601 --> 11:23.400
Because we still got shit to do.

11:23.401 --> 11:25.233
Now, enjoy yourself.
It's a celebration!

11:25.234 --> 11:27.766
Cheers.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.467
Fucking dick.

11:42.767 --> 11:45.966
Feeling a little displaced?

11:45.967 --> 11:48.966
Do you have any idea
how tedious these things are

11:48.967 --> 11:50.733
when you're not drinking?
Mm-mm.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.266
Mmm.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.433
You see your boy?

11:55.434 --> 11:57.100
I will bet you 50 bucks

11:57.101 --> 11:58.733
that Twenty over there
strikes out

11:58.734 --> 12:00.000
with the Bishop... you want in?

12:00.001 --> 12:01.133
Oh, you're on.

12:01.134 --> 12:02.301
Oh, okay!

12:03.467 --> 12:06.633
Are you fucking serious?

12:06.634 --> 12:08.300
Just tell me
he sucks at his job.

12:08.301 --> 12:09.533
He sucks at his job.

12:09.534 --> 12:10.500
Nah, really?

12:10.501 --> 12:12.033
No, he's very, very good.

12:12.034 --> 12:13.066
He's good?
Yeah.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.866
Great. Fantastic.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.833
I fucked up.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.766
I know, this is gonna be the
easiest 50 bucks I've ever made.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.633
Going over to Monica's?

12:21.634 --> 12:23.366
Going against Marty?

12:23.367 --> 12:25.033
I mean, how fucking
stupid could I be?

12:25.034 --> 12:26.033
And now, I mean,

12:26.034 --> 12:27.600
forget about working my way up.

12:27.601 --> 12:29.366
No, no, no, no, no.

12:29.367 --> 12:32.333
I have to bust my ass
just to one day maybe,

12:32.334 --> 12:35.133
maybe gain a tiny bit
of trust back.

12:35.134 --> 12:37.566
Yeah, going to Monica's was

12:37.567 --> 12:40.100
the stupidest decision
you've ever made.

12:40.101 --> 12:43.333
It might be the stupidest
decision anyone's ever made.

12:43.334 --> 12:45.166
Thank you.
Like, in the history of ever.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.533
Jesus Chri...
You know, it's like

12:46.534 --> 12:48.433
a Wile E. Coyote plan,
but somehow

12:48.434 --> 12:49.533
with less forethought.

12:49.534 --> 12:51.066
Okay, thank you.
It was a bad move.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.100
Just saying.
Stop it!

12:52.101 --> 12:53.100
But, Clyde?

12:53.101 --> 12:55.066
The idea behind it...

12:55.067 --> 12:57.033
you know,
not putting all of your eggs

12:57.034 --> 12:59.166
in the Marty Kaan basket...

12:59.167 --> 13:00.767
that was smart.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.533
Did you two ever fuck?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.866
Welcome back, Clyde.
Mmm. It's good to be back.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.066
Jeannie?

13:09.067 --> 13:11.600
Can I talk to you for a minute?

13:11.601 --> 13:12.766
Marty!

13:12.767 --> 13:14.767
What up, Clyde?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.767
Yeah!

13:27.967 --> 13:30.401
Hello, Marissa McClintock's
room, please.

13:31.434 --> 13:32.566
What's up?

13:32.567 --> 13:34.766
We may be switching sides,

13:34.767 --> 13:36.800
exposing the double cross
to Lukas

13:36.801 --> 13:39.533
and see if we can't, you know,
leverage it for our advantage.

13:39.534 --> 13:41.566
Why? What happened
with Dre?

13:41.567 --> 13:43.400
Oh, fuck Dre, okay?

13:43.401 --> 13:45.900
He turned out to be a completely
unpredictable asshole.

13:45.901 --> 13:47.933
So, you want someone
more predictable?

13:47.934 --> 13:49.300
Like Lukas?

13:49.301 --> 13:51.200
Well, at least he's
a manageable asshole.

13:51.201 --> 13:54.300
Well, now I know we're talking
about two different people.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.900
Jeannie, I...
I don't see the advantage.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.400
You don't need to see it, okay?

13:57.401 --> 13:58.633
I see it.

13:58.634 --> 14:00.900
Vodka, neat.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.833
Marty?

14:02.834 --> 14:04.133
Did you and Dre break up?

14:04.134 --> 14:06.900
God, I liked you so much better
when I was your boss.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.933
Hmm, do you think this
conversation would be going

14:08.934 --> 14:10.533
any differently
if you still were?

14:10.534 --> 14:12.900
Listen, I need you
to feel Lukas out, okay?

14:12.901 --> 14:15.866
Figure out if we expose
this double cross, I...

14:15.867 --> 14:18.266
can he keep his emotions
in check so we got a play?

14:18.267 --> 14:21.434
Or is he gonna, you know, try
to go all scorched earth on us?

14:22.534 --> 14:23.666
Can you do that?

14:23.667 --> 14:25.066
Oh, sure thing, chief.

14:25.067 --> 14:26.533
And thanks for the
plum assignment.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.500
I'll get cracking
on it tout de suite.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.166
What the fuck is wrong with you?

14:30.167 --> 14:32.000
I'm asking; I'm not ordering.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.333
Okay, I'd do it myself,
but I'm not a blonde seven

14:34.334 --> 14:36.466
with perky tits.
Excuse me?

14:36.467 --> 14:37.466
A seven?

14:37.467 --> 14:39.533
I don't want you
getting a big head.

14:39.534 --> 14:41.433
Yeah, no danger there, Marty.

14:41.434 --> 14:42.700
Okay, tout de suite.

14:42.701 --> 14:44.033
I get it!

14:44.034 --> 14:47.466
Nike changed the game,
Air Jordans, blah, blah, blah.

14:47.467 --> 14:48.666
Blah, blah...?
I'm just saying...

14:48.667 --> 14:50.466
Hold up, hey! Where Lukas?

14:50.467 --> 14:53.200
Hey, Lukas? Hey, come holler
at me real quick, man.

14:53.201 --> 14:54.966
What's up?

14:54.967 --> 14:56.500
Hey, so shorty right here,

14:56.501 --> 14:57.800
she trying to tell us

14:57.801 --> 15:00.000
that Adidas is better than Nike.
Ah!

15:00.001 --> 15:01.833
I did not say "better."

15:01.834 --> 15:04.200
I just said you can't discount
the cultural relevance

15:04.201 --> 15:05.966
Adidas has.

15:05.967 --> 15:07.100
Man, fuck cultural relevance.

15:07.101 --> 15:08.800
Of course,
there is that argument.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.700
Okay, all right, Miss Smarty
Pants, you know it all?

15:10.701 --> 15:13.166
Such a sneaker head, tell me
what Lukas got on right now.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.166
Yeah, a real sneaker head
would've noticed them earlier.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.033
True. No peeking.

15:17.034 --> 15:18.866
High-top Air Force Ones.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.533
Big fan
of the reflective swoosh.

15:20.534 --> 15:22.533
'07s, yeah?

15:22.534 --> 15:25.266
You can go lick your wound
over there, partner.

15:25.267 --> 15:26.833
I got some business I need
to talk about with her.

15:26.834 --> 15:29.333
Whoosh! Nothing but net.

15:29.334 --> 15:31.000
Three points!
Oh, yeah?

15:31.001 --> 15:32.866
Bam! That's how you like it?
Right in the rim, huh?

15:32.867 --> 15:35.000
Right on the... No.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.566
Hey, you know that, uh...

15:37.567 --> 15:39.433
that offer to check
out my collection

15:39.434 --> 15:40.833
still stands.
Oh!

15:40.834 --> 15:42.266
That's very tempting.

15:42.267 --> 15:44.900
But I think we should
just keep this professional.

15:44.901 --> 15:46.300
Yes, professional.

15:46.301 --> 15:48.300
Like, what if I were to tell you

15:48.301 --> 15:51.200
that I wanted someone with
real respect for the product

15:51.201 --> 15:53.433
to run point on this consult?

15:53.434 --> 15:57.366
I would tell you that I am still
not going to sleep with you.

15:57.367 --> 16:00.200
That's your loss,
but the job is still yours.

16:00.201 --> 16:02.334
Oh!

16:03.267 --> 16:06.000
Uh...
Oh?

16:06.001 --> 16:08.033
So, I put you in charge
of consulting

16:08.034 --> 16:10.533
the entire Soldier sneaker line,

16:10.534 --> 16:13.533
and all you have
to say is, "Oh"?

16:13.534 --> 16:15.000
Not even a smile?

16:15.001 --> 16:16.066
What the fuck is wrong?

16:16.067 --> 16:17.933
I thought you people
liked promotions.

16:17.934 --> 16:19.766
No... Yes, I mean, um...
I thought you...

16:19.767 --> 16:22.301
This... Thank you.
This is very exciting.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.767
We gonna finish this.

16:40.801 --> 16:43.233
What the fuck is this, man?

16:43.234 --> 16:44.766
You said you
always wanted one, right?

16:44.767 --> 16:45.800
Yeah, I mean, but...

16:45.801 --> 16:47.200
Well, this is a little present

16:47.201 --> 16:49.266
for putting in
all that hard work.

16:49.267 --> 16:50.266
My man.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.500
Really?

16:51.501 --> 16:53.066
Yeah, sit on the joint,
see how it feel like.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.833
Ah. Come on, show Lukas
some love, y'all.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.466
Come on, bring some love.

16:56.467 --> 16:57.801
Give him some love.
Come on.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.566
Hi. Hey. Hi.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.766
Hi.
Can I please talk to you

17:01.767 --> 17:02.800
for-for just one minute?

17:02.801 --> 17:05.101
Okay.
Thank you.

17:06.586 --> 17:08.266
Jeannie...
Hey, Jeannie, everything's fine.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.001
Who says it's not?
Excuse us.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.965
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

17:15.967 --> 17:18.066
You killed his dog?!

17:18.067 --> 17:19.733
Caitlin, goddamn it!
Doug, that's horrible!

17:19.733 --> 17:21.366
I know! I know!

17:21.367 --> 17:22.766
You think I don't know?

17:22.767 --> 17:25.701
God, I...

17:27.034 --> 17:28.465
I feel terrible about it.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.133
I feel sick about it.

17:30.134 --> 17:31.266
I love animals!

17:31.267 --> 17:33.200
No one loves animals
more than me.

17:33.201 --> 17:34.266
Oh, my God!

17:34.267 --> 17:35.366
Every year, I give...

17:35.367 --> 17:37.800
I give my $25 to the ASPCA.

17:37.801 --> 17:39.300
No questions asked, you know?

17:39.301 --> 17:41.200
And-and I even use those
ugly address labels

17:41.201 --> 17:42.566
just to get the word out.

17:42.567 --> 17:45.101
Oh, you poor thing.
Oh.

17:47.034 --> 17:48.500
Do you want me to be there

17:48.501 --> 17:50.633
when you tell Lukas?

17:50.634 --> 17:53.701
You are gonna tell him, right?

17:55.234 --> 17:57.200
Uh... yeah.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.233
Yes.

17:58.234 --> 18:00.167
Um, I can't not tell him.

18:01.367 --> 18:02.966
I mean, I could not tell him.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.533
Is that what you're getting at?

18:04.534 --> 18:06.033
No, you're saying tell him.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.767
Oh! Which I will.
I will tell him.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.466
What up, Joshua Jackson?

18:21.467 --> 18:22.900
Huh?

18:22.901 --> 18:26.333
'Cause you're all Pacey;
the name of the character

18:26.334 --> 18:27.700
on <i> Dawson's...</i>

18:27.701 --> 18:29.800
Don't listen to me.
I've had a lot to drink.

18:29.801 --> 18:31.933
What you think,
because I'm a black man,

18:31.934 --> 18:34.501
I've never seen the <i> Creek</i>
before, Jeannie?

18:37.267 --> 18:38.900
Did I just racially profile you?

18:38.901 --> 18:40.533
A little bit.

18:40.534 --> 18:41.934
Hmm.

18:43.401 --> 18:46.300
This looks confusing.

18:46.301 --> 18:48.300
Not that much.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.433
You see, um...

18:50.434 --> 18:52.400
got your brake...

18:52.401 --> 18:54.966
throttle.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.101
And that's about it.

19:00.034 --> 19:02.933
So, um, why exactly you think

19:02.934 --> 19:06.466
Dre gave me this bike?

19:06.467 --> 19:09.000
Because...

19:09.001 --> 19:11.133
despite the way he acts,

19:11.134 --> 19:13.601
he respects and appreciates you.

19:17.367 --> 19:18.766
Now, given your profession,

19:18.767 --> 19:21.234
you should be a little bit
better at bullshitting.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.766
You know, before he got married,

19:31.767 --> 19:37.366
Dre had this rotation
of females he used to fuck.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.633
My, you have an odd
sense of foreplay.

19:40.634 --> 19:44.366
Each one of them got
a piece of jewelry.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.833
The longer they were
in the rotation,

19:46.834 --> 19:48.400
the more expensive the piece.

19:48.401 --> 19:51.333
But once you got it...

19:51.334 --> 19:54.666
that's it.
It was over.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.633
This party...

19:56.634 --> 19:59.666
this bike...

19:59.667 --> 20:02.234
even these shoes...

20:04.267 --> 20:07.133
They're parting gifts,

20:07.134 --> 20:09.500
aren't they?

20:09.501 --> 20:13.301
My expensive pieces of jewelry.

20:15.267 --> 20:17.633
Dre intends to move on
without me, doesn't he?

20:17.634 --> 20:20.401
At least that's the plan, right?

20:22.434 --> 20:25.033
You think you got
all the information

20:25.034 --> 20:26.666
you need down here now?

20:26.667 --> 20:27.566
Lukas, I...

20:27.567 --> 20:29.901
Yeah, I bet you better
get back to the...

20:39.667 --> 20:41.467
Hey, Jeannie. Jeannie!

20:48.501 --> 20:50.366
Marty! I got
good news, man.

20:50.367 --> 20:52.200
I just get off
the phone with Marissa.

20:52.201 --> 20:53.566
She says hello, by the way.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.866
Great. Tell her hi.
And who the fuck is she? Yeah.

20:55.867 --> 20:57.600
Are you fucking...?
The girl I'm dating, Marissa.

20:57.601 --> 20:59.733
The black sheep of the McClintock
Family Media empire.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.266
Racist.
That's not a racist word, black sheep.

21:01.267 --> 21:02.533
Yes, I know who that is.

21:02.534 --> 21:04.666
Yes, the piece of business that
I hired you for

21:04.667 --> 21:06.133
that you've yet
to fucking close on.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.000
I'm about to close on it, okay?
Do tell.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.433
She was talking to Julian Zannino.
Zannino?

21:09.434 --> 21:11.033
Yeah. Hedge fund guy
out of New York.

21:11.034 --> 21:13.033
You heard of him?
I know who that is.

21:13.034 --> 21:14.800
I think he could be the
leverage we need

21:14.801 --> 21:16.600
to wrestle control
of the business from her siblings.

21:16.601 --> 21:18.900
He's gonna be here in a couple weeks.
And guess what, daddy?

21:18.901 --> 21:21.333
I set up a meeting with him.
Beautiful. We'll talk to him

21:21.334 --> 21:23.300
in a couple weeks, okay?
No, you know what, actually?

21:23.301 --> 21:24.933
Is it possible
to chat things out now?

21:24.934 --> 21:26.333
It is. Okay, I think...
Wait... no.

21:26.334 --> 21:28.333
If we... Marty, I think
when he gets...

21:28.334 --> 21:30.667
He's a busy dude, though, okay?

21:36.601 --> 21:39.567
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:47.601 --> 21:49.301
Jeannie.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.733
So? Lukas knows Dre
is trying to push

21:52.734 --> 21:54.033
him out of the company.

21:54.034 --> 21:55.566
And he thinks we're involved,

21:55.567 --> 21:57.300
so it's not great.
Great job, Jeannie.

21:57.301 --> 21:59.300
Don't even try
to pin this on me.

21:59.301 --> 22:00.600
How the fuck did he know?

22:00.601 --> 22:03.066
That thought was in his head way
before I even approached him.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.633
If we're gonna make a move

22:04.634 --> 22:07.500
to win him over, Marty,
we gotta do it now.

22:07.501 --> 22:08.900
So, this one still pissed at me?

22:08.901 --> 22:11.901
I'm gonna go get a drink.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.466
Go work the other
boss, sweetheart.

22:15.467 --> 22:16.901
Give us a minute.

22:18.834 --> 22:21.066
I was thinking about
our conversation earlier.

22:21.067 --> 22:23.500
Ah, fuck it, man.
It's just business, right?

22:23.501 --> 22:26.433
Yeah, that's true.

22:26.434 --> 22:28.566
But it didn't have
to be, though.

22:28.567 --> 22:31.500
And if I was you,
I would probably say something like,

22:31.501 --> 22:32.900
"Man, fuck that
motherfucker."

22:32.901 --> 22:35.166
Yeah, I was going with "asshole,"
but you know,

22:35.167 --> 22:36.300
"motherfucker"
is an acceptable option,

22:36.301 --> 22:39.500
if that was...

22:39.501 --> 22:42.033
But come on, man. I mean,
somebody like yourself,

22:42.034 --> 22:44.134
I mean, you got to understand
what that was about.

22:47.067 --> 22:50.200
Now, look. I trust
you, Marty, all right?

22:50.201 --> 22:51.833
And I respect you.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.966
But gotta know, man,
putting my future

22:53.967 --> 22:57.200
in someone else's hands,
even yours...

22:57.201 --> 22:58.500
that shit ain't easy.

22:58.501 --> 23:00.900
I get it.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.333
So we good?

23:02.334 --> 23:04.266
We good.

23:04.267 --> 23:05.666
My man.

23:05.667 --> 23:10.500
But we have a brand-new
exciting problem to fuck with.

23:10.501 --> 23:11.600
Whoa, Doug!

23:11.601 --> 23:13.733
Jesus Christ, slow down, man!

23:13.734 --> 23:15.733
What the fuck is wrong with you?

23:15.734 --> 23:18.633
I gotta tell a gangster
that I killed his dog.

23:18.634 --> 23:20.666
You have to do what now?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.633
It was an accident.

23:22.634 --> 23:26.700
Okay. So Doug did not
kill a dog in cold blood.

23:26.701 --> 23:29.200
Has anyone spoken
to Lukas tonight?

23:29.201 --> 23:31.733
I'm about to,
and I'm going in hard.

23:31.734 --> 23:33.700
Uh, what's wrong with Lukas?

23:33.701 --> 23:35.333
He's put some pieces togethe

23:35.334 --> 23:38.033
and I just want to make sure
that none of us have helped him.

23:38.034 --> 23:39.866
I haven't said a word
to him all night.

23:39.867 --> 23:42.601
All right, fuck it.
Let's do this!

23:43.701 --> 23:46.201
No more Mr. Nice Doug.

23:49.401 --> 23:50.700
Oh, he killed Lukas' dog.

23:50.701 --> 23:52.366
Of course he did.
Of course!

23:52.367 --> 23:53.733
Hey, hey, hey!

23:53.734 --> 23:56.400
Guess who's got two thumbs
and a blowie from a Bishop

23:56.401 --> 23:57.566
under his belt?

23:57.567 --> 24:00.533
Oh...
This...

24:00.534 --> 24:03.333
Oh! Oh, fuck!

24:03.334 --> 24:05.233
Oh, sorry, Jeannie.
I'm sorry about that.

24:05.234 --> 24:06.766
Let me rinse 'em off.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.966
Don't touch my feet!
Don't touch my feet!

24:08.967 --> 24:10.466
Get away from my feet!
Get away from my feet!

24:10.467 --> 24:13.566
Get away from...
Oh, it's so squishy. Oh!

24:13.567 --> 24:15.566
How are you not even looking
behind you?

24:15.567 --> 24:16.866
What is wrong with you?

24:16.867 --> 24:19.266
Oh, it's nothing.
I just fucked up

24:19.267 --> 24:21.534
and possibly cost us one
of our biggest clients.

24:26.367 --> 24:28.866
Oh, God, Will! Jesus!

24:28.867 --> 24:30.033
Where did everybody go?

24:30.034 --> 24:31.600
Shit, I don't know,
away from you,

24:31.601 --> 24:32.933
you fucking disgusting
piece of shit!

24:32.934 --> 24:34.466
Can we get
a couple waters, please?

24:34.467 --> 24:36.066
Put your number

24:36.067 --> 24:38.100
in my phone, girl.
We gonna talk later.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa.

24:40.034 --> 24:41.266
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:41.267 --> 24:43.200
Shoot, what the fuck
is wrong with you, Doug?

24:43.201 --> 24:47.033
Listen, motherfucker...

24:47.034 --> 24:48.401
I killed your dog.

24:53.634 --> 24:54.934
Really funny.

24:56.434 --> 24:58.933
What the fuck
you talking about, man?

24:58.934 --> 25:03.166
I killed your dog,
and I'm fucking...

25:03.167 --> 25:04.967
respect.

25:06.667 --> 25:07.901
So...

25:09.001 --> 25:10.466
Where's Manny?

25:10.467 --> 25:12.600
Vernon was watching him.

25:12.601 --> 25:13.866
Where's my dog?

25:13.867 --> 25:15.133
Look, man, I was upstairs,

25:15.134 --> 25:17.100
but then I had to go
to the bathroom

25:17.101 --> 25:18.633
'cause I spilled
something on my shoe...

25:18.634 --> 25:20.300
I know good and goddamn...
Goddamn!

25:20.301 --> 25:22.266
Lukas, I'm so sorry.

25:22.267 --> 25:23.433
I'm so sorry.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.533
How the fuck could you do
such a thing?

25:25.534 --> 25:27.666
I didn't! Not on purpose
I didn't!

25:27.667 --> 25:29.300
I swear to God!
Here's the thing.

25:29.301 --> 25:31.333
I didn't understand
the stigma of gift chocolates

25:31.334 --> 25:32.366
in the black community.

25:32.367 --> 25:33.766
Whoa. The stigma
of gift chocolates?

25:33.767 --> 25:35.333
What the fuck
you talking about, man?

25:35.334 --> 25:39.100
Hey, man, don't play dumb
with me.

25:39.101 --> 25:41.700
How black people
are offended by chocolates.

25:41.701 --> 25:42.866
I didn't know.

25:42.867 --> 25:44.400
Black people are offended
by white people

25:44.401 --> 25:45.866
who come to their parties and

25:45.867 --> 25:46.933
kill their goddamn dog.

25:46.934 --> 25:48.566
Ugh! Black people
are offended by everything.

25:48.567 --> 25:50.133
What the fuck you talking about, man?
No, now you

25:50.134 --> 25:51.900
should be!
You have every right to be!

25:51.901 --> 25:54.033
I would be, too, if I was...
I wasn't thinking!

25:54.034 --> 25:56.033
I didn't...
Yo, Lukas...

25:56.034 --> 25:58.566
want to do about this, man?

25:58.567 --> 25:59.700
Nothing! Nothing!

25:59.701 --> 26:01.133
You don't want
to do anything, 'cause...

26:01.134 --> 26:03.700
It's-It's the Gugg.

26:03.701 --> 26:05.866
It's the Gugg!
Honestly, I didn't

26:05.867 --> 26:07.900
even think about it.
I grew up in a cat house.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.366
Not a house of prostitution,
you know.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.867
But with cats in the house!

26:14.301 --> 26:15.700
Wait!
Lukas, please.

26:15.701 --> 26:17.167
It's over.
You fucked up, Doug.

26:41.001 --> 26:43.434
- Great party!
- Yeah...
