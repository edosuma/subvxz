<i>Beefs. No matter where you look,</i>

00:06.036 --> 00:08.005
<i>it seems you can't escape them.</i>

00:15.211 --> 00:17.397
<i>But just as quickly
as those beefs start,</i>

00:17.428 --> 00:20.165
<i>in the blink of an eye,
they're squashed...</i>

00:23.434 --> 00:27.306
<i>But not all beefs are squashed
so easily...</i>

00:27.978 --> 00:31.978

<i>And even though these celebs
have shown us</i>

01:00.574 --> 01:02.577
<i>there are a number of ways to make up:</i>

01:02.609 --> 01:06.580
<i>IG posts, Twitter apologies,
joint mix-tapes...</i>

01:06.613 --> 01:10.205
<i>sometimes all it takes
is a simple face-to-face</i>

01:10.230 --> 01:11.518
<i>"I'm sorry."</i>

01:13.553 --> 01:15.756
Hey.

01:15.790 --> 01:18.726
Um... I know we haven't
talked in a minute.

01:18.758 --> 01:22.396
And... I shouldn't have blown up
at you the other day.

01:22.430 --> 01:25.600
Plus, um, you know, I forgive
you for kicking me out.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.469
And... I'm sorry.

01:32.406 --> 01:35.776
<i>But in an age of fast beefs
and even faster makeups,</i>

01:35.809 --> 01:37.778
<i>have we become so desensitized</i>

01:37.812 --> 01:39.646
<i>to other people's hurt feelings,</i>

01:39.680 --> 01:40.782
<i>that we don't even realize</i>

01:40.815 --> 01:44.452
<i>when that simple
"I'm sorry" isn't enough?</i>

01:44.484 --> 01:46.553
So...

01:46.586 --> 01:47.654
Thanks, chief.

01:47.687 --> 01:49.624
Uh... hit you later.

01:52.793 --> 01:54.461
Hold up.

01:54.494 --> 01:56.731

- "Thanks, chief"?

02:34.667 --> 02:35.769
Seriously?

02:35.803 --> 02:38.606
How about "thank you, baby,
for forgiving me;

02:38.638 --> 02:39.874
I love and forgive you, too"?

02:39.906 --> 02:41.508
Nah, chief.

02:41.542 --> 02:42.844
I haven't heard from you in a week,

02:42.876 --> 02:44.778
now you show up with a half-ass apology

02:44.811 --> 02:46.513
expecting for us to be all good?

02:46.547 --> 02:48.615
Humorous. I mean, the world doesn't

02:48.649 --> 02:50.884
start and stop with Zoey Johnson.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.953
Doesn't it, though?

02:52.987 --> 02:56.457
- I get that you're mad...
- Actually, I'm not mad.

02:56.489 --> 02:58.892
You needed your time or whatever, and...

02:58.925 --> 03:00.695
now I need mine.

03:00.727 --> 03:02.629
And then he said he "wanted some space."

03:02.662 --> 03:03.864
- Oh.
- Ooh.

03:03.898 --> 03:05.966
More space? That's the final frontier.

03:06.000 --> 03:06.901
I know, right?

03:06.934 --> 03:08.803
Like, it's me, the love of his life,

03:08.835 --> 03:11.638
his muse, his literal everything,

03:11.672 --> 03:12.806
and he tossed me to the side

03:12.840 --> 03:14.709
like I was some Michael Kors logo bag.

03:14.741 --> 03:15.810
The disrespect.

03:15.842 --> 03:17.711
Do not drag Mike into your dramz

03:17.745 --> 03:19.547
just because your man
thinks you're garbage.

03:19.579 --> 03:21.815
Harsh. But, I mean, I did get curved.

03:21.848 --> 03:23.483
Luca didn't just curve you,

03:23.517 --> 03:25.553
I mean, he straight-up dissed you.

03:25.585 --> 03:27.654
It's true. Curving
is more a passive rejection,

03:27.687 --> 03:29.023
like when you first showed up
to apologize

03:29.055 --> 03:31.725
- and he brushed you off.
- Then when he basically said to your face

03:31.758 --> 03:33.594
"kick rocks, you trash human being,"

03:33.626 --> 03:35.695
it legit went from a curve to a diss.

03:35.728 --> 03:36.898
He said none of those words.

03:36.930 --> 03:38.666
Read between the lines, boo-boo.

03:38.698 --> 03:40.734
This time, Lil' Lenny Kravitz
has had enough.

03:44.905 --> 03:47.608
Would you mind if I...
if I gave you a call tomorrow?

03:47.640 --> 03:48.910
Call me whenever you're free.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.853
I mean, you can't just, like,
play with people's emotions,

03:58.886 --> 04:00.687
then suddenly expect them
to forgive you.

04:00.721 --> 04:02.723
Why don't people understand that?

04:02.756 --> 04:05.592
- No, no, no!
- Oh.

04:05.626 --> 04:07.695
Um, is she on those hard
white-people drugs?

04:07.727 --> 04:09.729
Um, she's probably talking to her mom.

04:09.763 --> 04:12.799
You know, white girls talk to
their moms real reckless.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.936
- Who are you texting?
- Don't ask.

04:14.968 --> 04:16.937
Fine. But for the record,

04:16.970 --> 04:18.904
I asked about somebody
other than myself.

04:18.939 --> 04:20.808
- You did.
- Baby steps. Now back to me.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.041
How do I get Luca to forgive me?

04:22.076 --> 04:24.612
Oh, that's simple.
You know, in my experience,

04:24.645 --> 04:26.781
the best way to get back
in a man's good graces

04:26.814 --> 04:29.302
is to show up at his door
wearing a big-ass puff coat

04:29.327 --> 04:31.216
with nothing underneath
but a candy necklace

04:31.241 --> 04:32.753
and a pair of red Cortez.

04:35.088 --> 04:37.591
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry,
w-what experience?

04:37.624 --> 04:38.826
- Yeah.
- And what guy?

04:38.859 --> 04:39.927
Y'all don't know my life.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.729
Okay, my sister's pretend
"life" aside...

04:42.763 --> 04:43.683
Pssh, you'll see.

04:43.707 --> 04:45.954
...the absolute best way
to Luca's forgiveness

04:45.979 --> 04:48.453
is... You know what? to ignore him.

04:48.478 --> 04:50.218
The more times you apologize,
the more he'll just

04:50.243 --> 04:51.632
double down on his stubbornness.

04:51.657 --> 04:53.156
- He <i> is</i> stubborn.
- Yep.

04:53.181 --> 04:55.352
The point is, you got to act
like you don't give a shit.

04:55.353 --> 04:56.744
Because the person in the relationship

04:56.777 --> 04:59.614
who cares the least has the power.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.082
Okay, spoken like a girl

05:01.114 --> 05:03.583
who's no longer in a relationship.

05:03.616 --> 05:05.819
But I still got the power, though.

05:05.852 --> 05:08.655
Stay woke, Zoey, stay woke.

05:08.689 --> 05:09.991
All right, look, what you need to do

05:10.023 --> 05:12.603
is just get your mind off this,
like, entire situation.

05:12.628 --> 05:14.181
Come out with us. Let's get trashed.

05:14.206 --> 05:16.096
I am so in. Let's go get drinks.

05:16.129 --> 05:17.697
Okay, great. 'Cause Ana just texted

05:17.730 --> 05:19.360
for us to meet her at Titanium.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.635
- Ooh!
- Let's go!

05:20.667 --> 05:22.669
Pause. I am so out.

05:22.703 --> 05:24.839
Please, Zoey, try.

05:24.871 --> 05:26.244
I'm so sick of living in the middle

05:26.269 --> 05:27.657
of a cold war between the two of you.

05:27.682 --> 05:30.381
Okay, it's not like I signed up
for any of this.

05:30.406 --> 05:32.195
Look, what Ana did was messed up.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.706
- Yeah.
- We get it.

05:33.746 --> 05:35.049
But when are you gonna
get over this beef?

05:35.081 --> 05:38.162
Oh, my goodness. It is not a beef.

05:38.195 --> 05:39.695
It is nothing.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.789
It is a friendship
which has been reduced

05:41.821 --> 05:44.792
to a roommate situation, okay?

05:44.825 --> 05:46.794
She's like any other Cal U
student who'd live here.

05:46.826 --> 05:49.062
Except she's dead to me. Okay?

05:49.095 --> 05:51.031
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.869
<i>While my girls were out getting lit,</i>

05:54.902 --> 05:56.904
<i>I was enjoying a cozy night at home.</i>

05:56.936 --> 05:58.739
<i>I had my favorite PJs on</i>

05:58.772 --> 06:00.875
<i>and two seasons of
"Floribama Shore" saved.</i>

06:00.907 --> 06:02.076
<i>My night was a vibe.</i>

06:10.717 --> 06:13.753
Wait. Luca is at Titanium?

06:13.787 --> 06:14.922
You know what?

06:14.955 --> 06:16.090
He said he wanted time and space,

06:16.123 --> 06:18.826
and so I'm gonna give it to him.

06:18.859 --> 06:20.695
Yeah.

06:25.932 --> 06:28.935
Okay... that's enough time and space.

06:28.968 --> 06:31.671
But I can't roll up solo.

06:31.705 --> 06:33.774
I'm gonna need a wingman.

06:38.946 --> 06:40.715
Is that Zoey?

06:42.982 --> 06:44.751
I thought you said
she wasn't coming tonight.

06:44.785 --> 06:46.119
Why is she with her brother?

06:48.989 --> 06:51.758
Well zamn, Zaddy. I see you, Junior.

06:56.729 --> 06:58.965
With the girls' allegiances split

06:58.999 --> 07:01.201
between me and the "Cuban She-Devil,"

07:01.234 --> 07:03.871
I decided to bring in
someone who, by blood,

07:03.903 --> 07:05.038
has to have my back.

07:05.071 --> 07:06.874
But not before making sure

07:06.907 --> 07:09.710
he was worthy of stepping out
with your girl in public.

07:09.742 --> 07:12.912
His fly has to match my fly.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.048
Come on.

07:15.081 --> 07:17.951
Hi, guys. This is Junior.

07:17.984 --> 07:20.121
What is up? Andre Johnson Jr.

07:20.153 --> 07:21.221
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

07:21.254 --> 07:23.056
- Junior, at your service.
- Hey.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.792
- You can call me Junior.
- Hi.

07:24.825 --> 07:26.127
She doesn't call you anything.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.061
Oh.

07:28.095 --> 07:31.065
Don't worry.
I will diffuse the situation.

07:31.097 --> 07:32.967
I am loving that outfit.

07:32.999 --> 07:36.770
I mean, first communion on top,
party on the bottom.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.286
- That is...
- Hey, hold up.

07:38.310 --> 07:39.543
I gotta go handle a thing.

07:39.544 --> 07:40.907
You're cool hanging back
for a second, yeah?

07:40.941 --> 07:42.810
Sure, if these ladies will have me.

07:42.842 --> 07:43.843
Oh, we'll have you.

07:43.876 --> 07:45.946
You know, there's a seat over here

07:45.979 --> 07:47.248
with your name on it.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.915
Where?

07:48.948 --> 07:50.818
Get your ass up, Nebraska.

07:50.850 --> 07:51.985
All right.

07:53.119 --> 07:56.090
So, guys, what we having?

07:56.123 --> 08:00.828
My, uh, Lose It! app says I am
good for... two light beers.

08:03.864 --> 08:05.265
Wow.

08:05.299 --> 08:08.102
Just so funny.

08:12.205 --> 08:14.775
- What's up?
- Oh, hey.

08:14.807 --> 08:15.942
I didn't even know you were here.

08:15.975 --> 08:17.210
Such a small world.

08:17.244 --> 08:19.213
It's not that crazy of a coincidence.

08:19.246 --> 08:22.116
I mean, I literally live
500 feet away from here.

08:22.148 --> 08:23.817
Oh. Yeah.

08:23.850 --> 08:26.019
- You look fire, though.
- Oh.

08:26.052 --> 08:28.288
Boom. It's already working.

08:28.321 --> 08:33.193
Well, do you maybe wanna grab
a drink, or food, or something?

08:33.226 --> 08:36.196
Actually, I'm good.

08:36.229 --> 08:38.131
But, uh, have fun, though.

08:41.234 --> 08:44.305
Did I just get curved again?
Or was that a diss?

08:44.337 --> 08:47.654
How do I know when it's been upgraded?

09:01.021 --> 09:02.261
God.

09:02.285 --> 09:04.190
Hey, at least they're having a good time,

09:04.191 --> 09:06.826
which you could've been doing
if you would've listened to me

09:06.859 --> 09:09.028
and ignored Luca's ass
like I told you to.

09:09.061 --> 09:11.231
No, no, playing games is ridiculous.

09:11.264 --> 09:14.100
No, playing games gets you the power.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.870
Like I said before,
if you want the upper hand,

09:16.903 --> 09:19.038
you got to show these dudes <i> zero</i> love.

09:19.071 --> 09:21.207
That's why any man who tries
to interact with me

09:21.240 --> 09:24.077
has to come all the way correct.

09:24.110 --> 09:26.212
Yo. Jazz.

09:26.245 --> 09:29.048
That seems like he came
all the way incorrect.

09:29.081 --> 09:31.217
- Yeah.
- No, that's the result

09:31.250 --> 09:34.354
of going weeks showing nothing
but pure savagery.

09:34.388 --> 09:37.056
Power, Zoey. Get you some.

09:42.229 --> 09:44.031
You know what? I'm sorry.

09:44.063 --> 09:45.365
I-I gotta go deal with something.

09:45.398 --> 09:47.100
Okay, honestly? Seriously?
You're leaving?

09:47.133 --> 09:49.936
Cool. What in the world is happening?

09:53.974 --> 09:55.176
I'm glad you're here.

09:57.978 --> 09:59.113
Give me five minutes.

09:59.146 --> 10:00.114
Just come inside.

10:00.147 --> 10:02.016
Absolutely not.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.320
Look, I-I know I hurt you.

10:08.154 --> 10:11.324
And I'm sorry.
I-I... I'd like to explain.

10:11.358 --> 10:14.328
I just don't want to do this
outside on the porch.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.163
Really? Then I guess we're
not having this conversation.

10:17.196 --> 10:19.966
Look, I-I like you, Nomi.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.938
But I'm not gonna text you that,

10:23.970 --> 10:25.972
o-or do it through some app
or whatever it is that you do.

10:26.005 --> 10:28.942
I'm gonna have a real,
face-to-face conversation

10:28.975 --> 10:31.979
with the person I care about.

10:32.012 --> 10:33.147
Now, I have feelings for you,

10:33.180 --> 10:36.116
and I'd like to see where this goes.

10:36.148 --> 10:37.941
But this is up to you.

10:37.966 --> 10:39.160
You can either get in that car

10:39.186 --> 10:42.716
or you can come inside with me.

10:48.295 --> 10:51.332
The last thing you want to see

10:51.364 --> 10:53.967
when you're sitting abandoned
at a sticky table

10:54.000 --> 10:56.269
is your homegirl twerking on
your baby brother.

10:58.138 --> 11:00.206
Oh, no, wow. I stand corrected.

11:00.239 --> 11:02.783
<i>That</i> is the last thing you want to see.

11:04.411 --> 11:06.380
What's good, chief?

11:06.412 --> 11:09.048
Uh...

11:09.081 --> 11:13.186
Okay. Maybe Jazz's "playing it
cool" technique will work.

11:13.220 --> 11:17.023
I mean, savagery plus power
equals forgiveness.

11:19.326 --> 11:20.393
'Sup.

11:20.427 --> 11:22.296
Just seeing if you and Junior
are straight

11:22.329 --> 11:24.198
before I head back to the crib.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.702
Why wouldn't we be straight?

11:26.736 --> 11:28.176
'Cause I'm assuming
you've been drinking.

11:28.201 --> 11:30.170
I just wanted to make sure
that you get home safe.

11:30.202 --> 11:33.039
You know what? I don't get a [bleep].

11:36.042 --> 11:37.278
Why are you being so weird?

11:39.111 --> 11:42.181
I just need to know if you're
cool to get home or not.

11:42.215 --> 11:43.383
You know what?

11:43.417 --> 11:46.487
I couldn't care less.

11:46.519 --> 11:49.122
About anything.

11:51.358 --> 11:53.060
Great.

11:53.093 --> 11:56.063
Good luck to you, bro. I am off this.

11:56.095 --> 11:59.198
"I'm off this."

12:06.273 --> 12:09.243
Hey, Torres.

12:09.276 --> 12:11.045
Hey.

12:11.077 --> 12:12.178
It's been a minute.

12:12.211 --> 12:14.047
How've you been?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.249
I've been better.

12:15.282 --> 12:17.051
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.452
Look, I'm sorry you're getting the...

12:18.484 --> 12:21.055
kind of the brunt of all this, you know?

12:21.087 --> 12:23.523
Yeah, that makes two of us.

12:23.556 --> 12:26.026
Well, is there anything I can
do to make it better?

12:26.058 --> 12:28.428
Buy you a drink? Get you some
chili cheese fries?

12:28.461 --> 12:32.198
Gotta be something I can do
to make you smile, right?

12:32.231 --> 12:35.101
Honestly, um...

12:35.134 --> 12:38.071
this is kind of what got us into
trouble in the first place.

12:38.104 --> 12:39.406
Um...

12:39.438 --> 12:43.242
maybe we should just stay out
of each other's way.

12:43.276 --> 12:44.478
For good this time.

12:44.510 --> 12:46.079
Hmm.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.215
I don't want to give Zoey extra reasons

12:48.248 --> 12:49.416
to hate me.

13:05.499 --> 13:07.567
Sorry, miss. Your card was declined.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.335
Declined?

13:09.369 --> 13:11.171
God. What?

13:11.204 --> 13:14.407
This is so not a good time
for my father to make good

13:14.441 --> 13:18.112
on his promise to stop
financing my lifestyle.

13:18.144 --> 13:20.114
Hey, could you please try my Rush Card?

13:20.147 --> 13:22.083
It's cool. I got it.

13:24.316 --> 13:26.153
Thanks. You didn't have to do that.

13:26.186 --> 13:27.421
Yeah, well, it's done.

13:27.454 --> 13:30.491
Just know I will pay you back,
like, immediately.

13:30.523 --> 13:32.426
It's just probably a problem
with the bank.

13:32.459 --> 13:34.161
Zoey, do you want to be with me?

13:35.528 --> 13:38.364
- What?
- Do you want to be with me?

13:39.465 --> 13:41.534
Uh...

13:41.567 --> 13:44.270
Dude, y-you know I'm with Luca.

13:44.303 --> 13:47.140
Right. So why are you causing
so much unnecessary friction?

13:47.173 --> 13:49.342
- What are you talking about?
- Why are you still beefing with Ana?

13:49.375 --> 13:52.111
Mm. Right, so that is <i> all</i> on me?

13:52.144 --> 13:53.479
You're the one that's keeping it going.

13:53.513 --> 13:55.315
You didn't want to be with me last year,

13:55.348 --> 13:56.517
you don't want to be with me now,

13:56.550 --> 13:58.552
so why are you making such
a big deal about me and Ana?

13:58.585 --> 14:00.620
I don't get it.
It's, like, you got a man.

14:00.653 --> 14:02.321
You say you love him, right?

14:02.354 --> 14:04.457
- You're in love with him?
- Yes. God.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.460
And there it is.

14:06.493 --> 14:09.229
Look, I'm sorry, you know,
that this whole thing

14:09.262 --> 14:11.198
played out the way it did and
that you got your feelings hurt,

14:11.230 --> 14:13.200
and I know you're not the cause of it,

14:13.233 --> 14:15.202
but you're the only one that can fix it.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.405
Enjoy your drink.

14:23.849 --> 14:26.740
Here...

14:26.765 --> 14:30.249
it's gonna be a little brick out
there for you, young Cali.

14:30.282 --> 14:32.418
Ooh, so you think you know me?

14:32.451 --> 14:33.519
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah.

14:33.552 --> 14:37.356
Plus it'll give me
an excuse to come over later.

14:37.389 --> 14:39.592
You don't need an excuse.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.394
Good to know.

14:41.427 --> 14:43.529
- All right.
- Okay.

14:43.562 --> 14:45.465
- I'll see you.
- See you.

14:52.305 --> 14:55.441
Zoey, I need condoms.
Preferably Magnums.

14:55.475 --> 14:58.345
Eww, no! No. Mnh-mnh.

14:58.378 --> 15:01.794
Yeah. You're right.
I mean, this is college.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.616
- Who cares?
- I... Dude.

15:03.649 --> 15:07.286
Can you stop being an insane person?

15:07.320 --> 15:09.576
True. True, true, yeah.

15:09.601 --> 15:11.975
My hands are already full
with our parents' kids.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.292
Mm-hmm.

15:13.326 --> 15:15.156
And you are one of them.

15:16.562 --> 15:18.398
Talk to bro-bro.

15:18.431 --> 15:20.533
- What's wrong?
- All right, well...

15:20.566 --> 15:23.537
I had this beef with Ana
and then I took it out on Luca

15:23.570 --> 15:25.405
and then Luca... like,
I'm ready to make up with him

15:25.437 --> 15:26.639
but he's not, and I don't know.

15:26.672 --> 15:28.374
I'm just starting to wonder, like,

15:28.407 --> 15:31.644
what if I'm the problem with everything?

15:33.647 --> 15:36.450
I just want it to all go back to normal.

15:36.483 --> 15:39.253
Well, sounds like all you got to do

15:39.286 --> 15:41.722
is get out of your feelings
and apologize.

15:41.754 --> 15:43.489
Fun fact... tried that.

15:43.523 --> 15:45.558
I said I was sorry. Nothing changed.

15:45.591 --> 15:47.460
So now I'm in this stupid outfit

15:47.494 --> 15:49.873
trying to be all savage
and woke like Jazz.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.438
Okay, look.

15:51.464 --> 15:55.302
I don't know much about college
or woke savages

15:55.335 --> 15:57.237
or even Jazz,

15:57.269 --> 16:00.273
but I have heard your apologies before,

16:00.306 --> 16:01.575
and they are pretty empty.

16:01.608 --> 16:05.412
Oh. Well, I am sorry you think
I'm bad at apologizing.

16:05.445 --> 16:08.348
See? Do you even hear yourself?

16:08.380 --> 16:11.071
There was nothing behind that apology.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.610
You just sounded defensive.

16:12.635 --> 16:14.287
So, maybe next time,

16:14.321 --> 16:17.423
you should try to apologize
for someone else's benefit

16:17.456 --> 16:18.658
instead of your own.

16:21.528 --> 16:25.365
I hear you, Andre Johnson Jr.

16:26.465 --> 16:28.668
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

16:30.537 --> 16:32.773
Yeah.

16:32.806 --> 16:36.310
So, what now? Where do we go from here?

16:36.343 --> 16:38.278
- The semester's over.
- Mm-hmm.

16:38.311 --> 16:39.646
You're no longer in my class...

16:39.678 --> 16:42.348
Oh, bummer.

16:42.382 --> 16:45.686
- What? I sense sarcasm, right?
- No. No, I really...

16:45.719 --> 16:47.354
I enjoyed your class so much,

16:47.387 --> 16:50.390
especially, um, getting
to expose all the frauds

16:50.422 --> 16:51.524
who thought that being a feminist

16:51.557 --> 16:52.692
was knowing all the songs on "Lemonade."

16:55.729 --> 16:57.943
Oh, well, as much as I'm gonna miss

16:57.968 --> 17:00.013
your charged debates about everything...

17:00.038 --> 17:01.468
Mm-hmm.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.336
...I got to say, I'd rather have this.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.405
Yeah.

17:05.438 --> 17:06.640
Me too.

17:16.507 --> 17:18.175
Okay.

17:18.201 --> 17:21.146
As much as I hate to admit it,
Junior's right.

17:21.209 --> 17:22.957
My apology to Luca was empty

17:22.982 --> 17:25.558
because I've been so caught up
in my own feelings,

17:25.592 --> 17:28.695
it didn't even occur to me that
I was hurting everyone else's.

17:28.728 --> 17:33.566
And I know what I need to do
to make things right.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.334
Okay.

17:43.643 --> 17:44.845
Hi.

17:44.877 --> 17:46.779
Hey.

17:46.813 --> 17:51.418
I'm really sorry,
and not just about the milk.

17:51.451 --> 17:53.720
About everything.

18:04.463 --> 18:05.598
'Sup.

18:05.632 --> 18:08.468
Uh, hi.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.705
Didn't get the usual "I made it
home" text from you last night.

18:12.739 --> 18:15.741
Would you have even responded?

18:15.775 --> 18:17.544
Probably not.

18:17.576 --> 18:19.779
But it's good to know you're safe.

18:19.813 --> 18:21.448
Where you headed?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.650
Just hanging with the homies.

18:23.682 --> 18:25.451
Oh.

18:25.485 --> 18:27.788
So, you, Ana, and Aaron
are cool again, huh?

18:31.524 --> 18:32.893
We are.

18:32.925 --> 18:34.493
Um...

18:34.527 --> 18:36.462
I've realized I was being unfair

18:36.496 --> 18:39.733
to a lot of people, including you.

18:39.766 --> 18:43.903
And, you know, look, I never
meant to make you feel like

18:43.937 --> 18:46.506
the situation was about someone else,

18:46.538 --> 18:47.807
because it isn't.

18:47.841 --> 18:50.477
All right? There isn't anyone else.

18:50.509 --> 18:52.479
It's just you.

18:52.511 --> 18:57.416
And... I love you,
and I'm really, really sorry.

18:57.450 --> 19:00.519
Sincerely.

19:00.553 --> 19:01.854
Thank you.

19:01.887 --> 19:03.589
Means a lot to me.

19:03.623 --> 19:06.759
Uh, would you care to join us?

19:06.793 --> 19:09.863
I can't. But I can come
to the crib later.

19:09.895 --> 19:11.831
Maybe we could catch up
on some of our shows.

19:11.864 --> 19:13.700
I would really like that.

19:13.732 --> 19:16.769
- Same.
- Then I will see you later, I guess.

19:16.803 --> 19:18.439
Okay.

19:21.908 --> 19:23.844
And I love you, too, chief.

19:25.812 --> 19:29.816
<i>As improbable as it seemed,
my little brother was right.</i>

19:29.848 --> 19:32.551
<i>To get the forgiveness I was seeking,</i>

19:32.585 --> 19:34.888
<i>I had to forgive first.</i>

19:41.995 --> 19:43.964
You got to work on your aim.

19:43.997 --> 19:46.633
Sorry.

19:50.737 --> 19:52.706
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:52.739 --> 19:54.807
- Ana is still getting ready.
- Okay, cool.

19:54.841 --> 19:56.743
Ana! Aaron's here!

19:56.776 --> 19:58.545
Okay, coming!

19:59.845 --> 20:00.913
Luca.

20:00.947 --> 20:02.883
I see you have your date shirt on.

20:06.585 --> 20:08.488
I'm not mad at it.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.855
Thanks.

20:14.727 --> 20:17.497
Wow, you look, uh... you look amazing.

20:17.529 --> 20:19.532
Thank you. So do you.

20:19.566 --> 20:20.866
You both look amazing.

20:20.900 --> 20:24.838
But guess what.
You look amazing <i> together.</i>

20:24.871 --> 20:27.541
Have the best night tonight.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

20:27.574 --> 20:28.608
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what? Scrap that.

20:28.641 --> 20:29.843
Do whatever you want to

20:29.875 --> 20:33.680
because you have my full
support, my 100% blessing.

20:33.712 --> 20:35.614
I am in support of all of this.

20:35.647 --> 20:38.127
- All of it. Yay.
- Okay. I just did my makeup.

20:39.751 --> 20:41.555
- Have a great time.
- Okay. We're gonna go now.

20:41.587 --> 20:42.922
You know, do a lot of kissing!

20:42.956 --> 20:44.758
Ooh, wait!

20:44.790 --> 20:47.860
Hey, what if you do a little
quick pic for the 'Gram?

20:47.893 --> 20:49.930
- I think we're good.
- Okay.
