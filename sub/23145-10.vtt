WEBVTT

00:03.053 --> 00:06.739
- What the hell! It's only 3:00 p.m.!
- Family announcement!

00:08.244 --> 00:09.141
Family announcement!

00:09.143 --> 00:12.045
Luckily, my stool-softening pill
hasn't kicked in...

00:12.080 --> 00:13.373
Ohhhhhhh!

00:13.848 --> 00:14.934
Family announcement.

00:14.969 --> 00:17.015
Luckily, my orgasm pill
hasn't kicked in...

00:17.017 --> 00:19.451
Aaah!

00:19.453 --> 00:21.052
Welcome to family announcement.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.255
As you are all aware,
I've been on the wait list

00:23.257 --> 00:26.924
for the Shaquille O'Neal
Center for Intense Sleep Apnea.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.794
They only accept the loudest
three percent of snorers

00:29.796 --> 00:32.664
in the nation, and I am in!

00:32.665 --> 00:34.332
Top three, baby!

00:36.136 --> 00:39.137
Well, they called,
and a spot opened up tonight.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.138
Tonight?

00:40.140 --> 00:42.206
But it's Third Friday of the month...

00:42.208 --> 00:43.675
our Friday fun night.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.344
Oh, right. Damn.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.946
Hon, just do the study.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.881
- We'll go out next month.
- No, no, no.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.883
It's very important you get a night out.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.951
- You work so hard.
- I do?

00:53.953 --> 00:55.219
It's an expression.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.888
Hayley, how about taking
your mother out tonight?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.423
Can't. Tonight's the night
we slice all the olives

00:59.425 --> 01:01.559
for the entire year at Sub Hub.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.627
- But I can lend you Jeff.
- Hmm.

01:03.629 --> 01:04.896
I like that for Francine.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.097
Have him washed, dressed,

01:06.099 --> 01:08.833
and at the base of the stairs by 7:00.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.234
Family announcement adjourned.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.436
I look forward to
organically crossing paths

01:12.438 --> 01:15.239
with each of you around the house.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.309
Steve, did you get a chance
to look at the e-mail

01:17.311 --> 01:19.844
I sent you with a link to
all my hilarious, accurate,

01:19.846 --> 01:21.579
and irreverent impressions?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.515
- Yeah, I guess.
- You guess?!

01:23.517 --> 01:25.583
I sent it to you like 15 times.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.784
Which e-mail address?

01:26.786 --> 01:29.321
SteveSmith69@gmail.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.923
Oh, that one got hacked.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.327
- Uh, send it to SteveSmith420.
- What?!

01:35.411 --> 01:38.396
You were able to get 420 <i> and</i> 69?

01:38.398 --> 01:42.867
Man, every other Steve Smith

02:09.363 --> 02:12.830
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

02:15.235 --> 02:17.835
Jeff, I want to thank you for
Hayley making you do this.

02:17.837 --> 02:18.836
You're welcome?

02:18.838 --> 02:20.438
No.<i> You're</i> welcome.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.306
Right.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.175
Before Francine and I were married,

02:24.177 --> 02:25.910
she was a pretty wild woman.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.379
She's mellowed over the years,

02:27.381 --> 02:29.247
but she's still wild at heart,

02:29.249 --> 02:31.515
and there's always the
risk she can relapse.

02:31.517 --> 02:33.117
- With me so far?
- No.

02:33.119 --> 02:34.052
Hmm.

02:34.054 --> 02:37.855
Better join me in my metaphor corner.

02:37.857 --> 02:38.990
Look at that bird

02:38.992 --> 02:41.726
flapping, tweeting, darting around.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.927
It's happy because it thinks

02:42.929 --> 02:45.196
it's positively going wild.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.265
But what would happen if I open a window

02:47.267 --> 02:49.067
and really let it go wild?

02:49.344 --> 02:51.469
It would fly right into the sun!

02:51.471 --> 02:53.137
Yes. Yes, it would.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.073
Uh, I'm the bird.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.741
- No.
- I'm the cage?

02:56.743 --> 02:59.077
No. You're... You're not really
represented in this metaphor.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.545
Oh. Do you still need me tomorrow?

03:01.547 --> 03:02.814
It's tonight, Jeff.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.483
Tonight,
we let Francine out of her cage,

03:05.485 --> 03:07.619
and you're going to be
there to prevent her

03:07.621 --> 03:09.621
from flying into the sun.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.890
So I <i> am</i> the cage.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.425
You're not in the metaphor!

03:13.427 --> 03:16.795
Take what time you need,
then meet me back at my desk.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.636
Ah. You made it. Over the years,

03:24.638 --> 03:26.704
I've calculated the
precise amount of stimulus

03:26.706 --> 03:29.974
Francine needs to feel
like she's going wild

03:29.976 --> 03:31.643
without really going wild.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.177
Like the bird.

03:33.179 --> 03:35.580
That's right. The 75 minutes you spent

03:35.582 --> 03:37.048
in the corner served you well.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.183
Now, pay close attention
because you're about to get

03:39.185 --> 03:41.853
a crash course in Francine Control.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.322
No cinnamon. Its aroma is too primal.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.390
Do not let her put on flat shoes.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.127
She ran track in high school,
and you'll never catch her.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.795
Do not let her get wind in her hair.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.464
It conjures strange passions.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.800
None of those clown scarves you
can keep pulling on forever.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.336
No Israeli couscous, and I mean zero.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.538
And finally, if all else fails,

04:00.540 --> 04:03.608
remind her another episode of
Tom Selleck's "Blue Bloods"

04:03.610 --> 04:05.209
starts at 10:00 on CBS.

04:05.211 --> 04:07.345
She falls for the bait of sexy Magnum

04:07.347 --> 04:08.546
and ends up dozing off in bed

04:08.548 --> 04:10.682
to a series of family dinner scenes.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.284
This is too much to remember!

04:12.286 --> 04:14.085
You've been talking for hours!

04:14.087 --> 04:17.221
Don't worry,
I put everything on the card.

04:19.786 --> 04:22.093
You can count on me, Mr. S.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.963
And one more thing,
it's probably best Francine

04:24.965 --> 04:26.564
doesn't see the card.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.166
But I can see it, right?

04:28.583 --> 04:31.803
Yes, Jeff.
That's the cornerstone of our plan.

04:35.475 --> 04:38.143
We'll start with two tap waters.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.811
And a white wine spritzer.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.480
Wine and bubbles...

04:42.482 --> 04:44.282
that could be wild.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.350
Excuse me!

04:45.352 --> 04:47.084
How's the lighting under the table?

04:47.086 --> 04:49.454
The best in all of Langley.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.359
You can bring the spritzer!

04:54.361 --> 04:56.962
What are you doing down there?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.629
Playing cat's cradle.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.366
I was looking up your dress, Mrs. S.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.100
Oh!

05:03.102 --> 05:04.902
Ready to order? Can I suggest you start

05:04.904 --> 05:06.904
with our new Tableside Guacamole?

05:07.552 --> 05:10.375
Tableside, oh my!

05:10.377 --> 05:13.979
I read in <i> Sky Ways Magazine</i>
that Kiefer Sutherland

05:13.981 --> 05:19.316
has tableside guac every
time he's in San Antonio.

05:19.318 --> 05:20.451
Guacamole...

05:20.453 --> 05:22.220
guacamole...

05:24.992 --> 05:27.859
Sorry, Your Honor,
but guacamole's forbidden.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.926
Oh, let's have some.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.261
Let's live a little, Jeff.

05:32.331 --> 05:35.000
♪ Tableside, tableside ♪

05:35.002 --> 05:38.203
♪ So much hotter
when it's tableside ♪

05:42.209 --> 05:43.741
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.011
I... I don't know
if we have time for this.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.746
"Blue Bloods" starts at 10:00, you know?

05:48.748 --> 05:51.749
Hmm. I guess we'll pass.

05:51.751 --> 05:55.286
I heard in tonight's episode,
the DEA comes down hard

05:55.288 --> 05:57.689
on the family, and Tom Selleck

05:57.691 --> 06:00.358
has a booger in his mustache

06:00.360 --> 06:05.430
that no one tells him
about for the entire day.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.967
Okay, Steve.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.636
Got the house to yourself.

06:11.638 --> 06:15.306
Time for some risky business.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.509
Now all I need is some
royalty-free tunes.

06:18.511 --> 06:22.580
Alexa, play Bob Sargar's
"New Town Rock N' Loll."

06:25.638 --> 06:26.484
Aaah!

06:26.485 --> 06:30.288
_

06:30.538 --> 06:33.855
_

06:34.417 --> 06:37.949
_

06:38.348 --> 06:42.046
_

06:46.205 --> 06:48.673
Klaus? What happened?

06:48.675 --> 06:50.141
Pretty nasty fall.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.944
But don't worry, I'll take care of you.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.880
I don't get it, our living room floor

06:54.882 --> 06:56.948
has never been that slippery.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.483
Slippy Oil?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.618
Oh, you just had

07:00.620 --> 07:04.289
to look over at the Slippy Oil, Steve.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.226
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.630
Oh, you should have read
my e-mails, Steve.

07:12.632 --> 07:13.965
Y-You're saying "Oh"

07:13.967 --> 07:15.700
in front of everything you say, Klaus.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.035
Oh, am I?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.440
Mmm! That was good.

07:22.442 --> 07:27.512
So brown, so broiled,
with such a mild mustard.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.581
I'm sorry, sir,
this isn't a credit card.

07:30.583 --> 07:34.452
This is a note card with
impossibly tiny writing.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.188
"Francine Date Night Dos and Don'ts?"

07:37.190 --> 07:39.724
"No pickles over three inches?"

07:39.726 --> 07:42.527
"Only allowed to move pawns in chess?"

07:42.529 --> 07:45.463
"No Cocoa Puffs or any other cereals

07:45.465 --> 07:47.999
that drive their mascots insane?"

07:48.001 --> 07:49.267
It's not what it looks like!

07:49.269 --> 07:52.137
Mr. S just wants to keep
you from going wild.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.142
Ooooooh.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.946
I haven't gone wild in a long time.

08:04.884 --> 08:05.951
Guess what, Jeff?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.753
This Friday Fun Night
is about to go wild,

08:08.755 --> 08:11.990
and Stan can't stop me,
and neither can you.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.626
Flat shoes!

08:15.628 --> 08:17.562
Wait for me, Mrs. S!

08:17.564 --> 08:19.230
I can't let you go wild!

08:19.232 --> 08:23.434
Five orders of Tableside Guac!

08:23.436 --> 08:25.102
Mrs. S!

08:25.104 --> 08:27.572
Couldn't order six, huh? It's all right.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.509
I'll stay here and [BLEEP] myself,
why don't I?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.980
I'm going wild!

08:35.982 --> 08:37.982
Truck jump.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.217
Whoa! Cool!

08:43.990 --> 08:46.024
Oh, sick!

08:48.395 --> 08:49.528
Aah!

08:50.863 --> 08:52.130
No way!

08:52.604 --> 08:57.335
Aaah! Stop! For God's sake, stop!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.738
Oh! What's gonna happen?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.474
Tasty!

09:03.476 --> 09:06.344
Mrs. S, please don't go wild.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.012
What if I just go "hi-yuh?"

09:08.014 --> 09:09.414
- What?
- Hi-ya!

09:09.842 --> 09:12.517
Aw, man. Party's over.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.721
Oh, yeah! Back on.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.693
You think it's okay
to ignore my e-mails?

09:22.695 --> 09:26.765
Well, now you're gonna
watch all my impressions.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.635
Here's Martha Stewart
encountering a demon...

09:30.637 --> 09:31.770
"Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:31.772 --> 09:35.574
Time to cook the recipe and
put the thing in the oven."

09:35.576 --> 09:37.108
Aaah!

09:37.110 --> 09:39.310
- Oh, God!
- This the lady

09:39.312 --> 09:41.379
who used to work at the
Chimdale Jack in the Box

09:41.381 --> 09:45.116
visiting her former
co-workers for the first time.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.251
"I'm baaaaack!"

09:47.253 --> 09:49.254
Somebody kill me!

09:51.858 --> 09:53.858
Another round!

09:53.860 --> 09:55.193
- Whoooo!
- Francine!

09:55.195 --> 09:56.394
Yeah!

09:56.396 --> 09:57.728
Whoa!

09:57.730 --> 09:59.397
Yeah, bar fight!

09:59.399 --> 10:01.732
- Ugh!
- Wait. Is this a fight?

10:01.734 --> 10:04.335
Nah, he was thrown
off our mechanical bull.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.138
That's the most dangerous
bull in the country,

10:07.140 --> 10:09.540
aside from bull <i> shit.</i>

10:09.542 --> 10:13.011
Misinformation is the
real national crisis.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.345
Y'all want some popcorn?

10:14.903 --> 10:17.015
Here, Mrs. S!

10:17.017 --> 10:19.417
F.S.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.752
Francine Smith!

10:21.754 --> 10:24.155
Coyote Ugly! Coyote Ugly!

10:24.157 --> 10:25.357
Whoooooo!

10:28.543 --> 10:30.561
Let me kick your beer!

10:30.563 --> 10:32.563
Mrs. S, what are you doing?

10:32.565 --> 10:34.165
Gotcha!

10:34.167 --> 10:36.300
And stay out!

10:36.302 --> 10:38.769
Ooooooh. Fun alley.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.239
Let's get murdered by Batman's parents.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.841
Can we just go home now?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.710
Come on, Jeff.
You don't want to do that.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.780
You know that deep down inside,
you're like me...

10:49.782 --> 10:51.382
a wild woman!

10:51.384 --> 10:53.784
I'm... I'm a man.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.720
And how wild is that?!

10:55.722 --> 11:00.124
Now, close your eyes, Jeff,
and listen to your heart.

11:04.353 --> 11:05.463
I heard it!

11:05.465 --> 11:06.998
Shh. It's not done.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.402
There's no downside!

11:11.404 --> 11:12.671
That's right.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.606
Now, let's show them we
can go as wild as we want!

11:15.608 --> 11:16.741
Yeah!

11:16.743 --> 11:18.677
Let's do a series of quick,
little things,

11:18.679 --> 11:20.745
each more wild than the last.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.074

12:00.680 --> 12:03.254
Hey, I know what might be fun.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.924
Let's take something from a person.

12:05.926 --> 12:10.261
Let's show a human being
the true meaning of fear.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.731
- Stick 'em up!
- This is a bank robbery!

12:13.734 --> 12:15.800
Delmonaco?

12:15.802 --> 12:17.402
Francine!

12:17.404 --> 12:19.137
And who's this piece of ass?

12:19.139 --> 12:21.406
This is Jeff, my son-in-law.

12:21.408 --> 12:25.644
Jeff, Delmonaco, my dealer of drugs.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.414
Mwah. Enchanté.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.682
This is too crazy.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.284
I'm actually gonna go hang out

12:33.286 --> 12:35.019
one-on-one with my dry cleaner.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.421
You guys should come!

12:36.423 --> 12:38.623
Just you and your dry cleaner?

12:38.625 --> 12:41.393
That sounds crazy! We're doing it!

12:43.696 --> 12:46.697
Now, you should know,
Mr. Rick is a dry cleaner,

12:46.699 --> 12:50.235
so he hates washing machines.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.703
Mr. Rick, it's me, Delmonaco.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.573
Bullshit! You're a washing machine!

12:54.575 --> 12:57.976
Washing machines
don't knock on doors, Mr. Rick.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.846
Sounds like what a
washing machine would say!

13:02.849 --> 13:05.383
Come into my
house really fast, really fast.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.252
This guy's got a great energy.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.856
Welcome to paradise.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.724
Let me outline your night for you.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.261
We sit around,
we huff dry-cleaning chemicals,

13:16.263 --> 13:18.196
we have a scintillating conversation.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.330
I have only one rule...

13:19.332 --> 13:20.932
I feel silly even mentioning it...

13:20.934 --> 13:23.934
Nobody's allowed to turn
into a washing machine.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.337
It happens. And if it does,

13:26.339 --> 13:28.206
I will take care of business!

13:28.208 --> 13:31.542
Second rule...
so the conversation remains orderly,

13:31.544 --> 13:34.212
you speak when I have
the knife to your throat.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.680
You have the floor, m'lady.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.150
Mr. Rick, I need to use the restroom.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.019
So does Jeff.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.755
It's the first door past the
old Hollywood Video sign.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.291
This guy is giving me bad vibes.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.628
- In what way?
- He's insane!

13:49.630 --> 13:53.498
The toilet's right here,
and the toilet-scrubbing brush

13:53.500 --> 13:55.700
is all the way over there!

13:55.702 --> 13:57.568
We proved we could get wild,

13:57.570 --> 13:59.570
but I think we should go home now.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.373
This is my first time getting wild.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.375
I'm not going back to my cage.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.377
I'm flying straight to the sun.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.712
How are you guys doing?!

14:07.714 --> 14:09.380
If you spilled on yourselves,
don't worry,

14:09.382 --> 14:11.115
I have two bedrooms
full of women's clothes.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.852
I am particularly proud
of my sundress collection!

14:13.854 --> 14:16.655
But not so proud I couldn't
see myself giving you one

14:16.657 --> 14:18.589
if I thought it looked good on you.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.391
Jeff, I think we should get out of here.

14:23.176 --> 14:25.564
Bathroom time is over.

14:27.586 --> 14:29.133
It's game time!

14:29.135 --> 14:30.134
Wha...

14:30.136 --> 14:31.602
What game are we playing?

14:31.604 --> 14:34.072
It's Hot Potato with a loaded gun.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.075
My dear friend Tom Sizemore
taught me this game.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.479
But first, Tetrachloroethylene?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.214
Tetrachloroethylene?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.349
No?

14:46.286 --> 14:49.754
Ooooh! Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow, whoa!

14:51.558 --> 14:52.640
Whoa! It's hot!

14:53.093 --> 14:55.093
- Aah!
- Aah!

14:56.829 --> 14:59.630
They're afraid of a little gun,
Delmonaco!

14:59.632 --> 15:01.366
Psych! Psych! Pysch!

15:04.476 --> 15:05.636
You guys hear that?

15:05.638 --> 15:06.705
Someone's at the door.

15:06.707 --> 15:08.673
Could be a washing machine.

15:11.912 --> 15:16.114
My dry cleaner is dead!

15:16.116 --> 15:19.384
I am so sorry, Deltaco.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.124
Why must God take the perfect ones?!

15:26.126 --> 15:29.193
Now I have to tell his
13-year-old girlfriend!

15:29.195 --> 15:31.930
We're going to call the
cops right now and explain.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.599
But our fingerprints
are all over that gun.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.601
My God! What are we gonna do?!

15:36.603 --> 15:40.071
I'll call my fixer.
He'll get us out of this.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.740
Listen carefully to my instructions,

15:41.742 --> 15:43.074
we'll cover up this murder

15:43.076 --> 15:44.943
and all go back to our
beautiful evenings.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.078
I need you to make some hot Jasmine tea.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.212
Very weak.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.880
I have a very strong
intolerance to Jasmine.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.016
It's like poison to me...
total organ failure.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.884
But the flavor... get out of town!

15:53.886 --> 15:56.621
It's like I'm drinking
a warm summer night.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.557
Are you gonna get him the tea?

15:58.559 --> 16:00.358
Sounds like he shouldn't have it.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.427
Okay, first, this body needs

16:02.429 --> 16:04.429
to disappear without a trace.

16:05.201 --> 16:07.231
Oh, it's so bloody!

16:07.233 --> 16:08.967
God, it's all over.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.502
Ugh!

16:13.373 --> 16:14.905
Okay, this is a problem.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.708
I saw an episode of "CSI"
where the cops found blood,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.243
and they used it to solve the crime.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.579
This blood has to
disappear without a trace.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.582
I'll Google how. Phone.

16:23.584 --> 16:26.184
I do swipe text. Watch how fast.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.319
Kind of tricky with this
blood all over my hands,

16:28.321 --> 16:29.587
but... oh, here we go.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.522
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

16:33.664 --> 16:34.687
Murder.

16:36.435 --> 16:38.062
There <i> was</i> a murder.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.265
But don't you worry,
it's being handled by me

16:40.267 --> 16:41.800
and the other killers.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.536
<i>A patrol car's been
dispatched to your location.</i>

16:45.538 --> 16:46.871
Well, not everything worked out

16:46.873 --> 16:48.006
the way we thought it would.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.041
But I declare this situation...

16:52.078 --> 16:54.412
...fixed!

16:54.414 --> 16:57.415
I got to find a new dry cleaner.

16:58.619 --> 17:00.451
Fixer, murder! Fixer, murder!

17:00.553 --> 17:02.420
Fixer, murder! Fixer, murder!

17:02.422 --> 17:03.722
Fixer, murder!

17:05.892 --> 17:07.692
Okay, this is John Cusack

17:07.694 --> 17:10.228
being yelled at by an Uber driver.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.695
"Get out, John Cusack!

17:11.698 --> 17:15.165
You can't tell me I can't
smoke in my own car!"

17:15.167 --> 17:18.903
I don't understand.
Why didn't you do John Cusack?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.640
I can't do Cusack. He's impossible!

17:21.642 --> 17:23.241
Caliendo can't even do Cusack!

17:23.242 --> 17:25.510
This is my impression
of a domestic dispute

17:25.512 --> 17:27.912
I overheard at the mall last winter.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.381
"It's a bigger issue
than the fries, Jeanine.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.917
You don't respect me!"

17:36.523 --> 17:39.457
Oh, my God. I get it now.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.459
- It's good.
- Yes.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.793
You're a genius.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.529
All it took was being held captive

17:44.531 --> 17:46.064
for six hours to realize it.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.667
Yeah, I'm a bit of an acquired taste.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.806
Okay, I know I'm good,
but you're giving me

17:55.808 --> 17:58.276
a Horatio Sanz-level reception here.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.411
Give me more. More!

18:00.413 --> 18:03.214
You know,
I totally forgot today's the day

18:03.216 --> 18:06.217
I was supposed to help
Jurgen hunt Slender Man.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.819
And I've already pushed
the hunt like five times,

18:08.821 --> 18:10.355
so I'll just release
you from your bonds,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.657
and we can both go our separate ways.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.229
I may be free to go,
but I'm a slave to laughter.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.165
Now do Al Pacino
forgetting the combination

18:21.167 --> 18:22.567
to his gym locker!

18:22.569 --> 18:24.569
Somebody help me!

18:24.571 --> 18:26.837
That's exactly what'd he say!

18:29.576 --> 18:31.175
Dang it. The cops are here,

18:31.177 --> 18:33.111
and the Uber's still three minutes out.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.914
I'd cancel it,
but that's my rating on the line.

18:36.372 --> 18:37.716
We're going to jail

18:37.718 --> 18:39.183
for murder.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.785
Stan was right.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.920
We're too wild

18:41.922 --> 18:43.522
to be trusted with ourselves.

18:43.524 --> 18:44.989
Hold on, Mrs. S.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.592
Maybe alone we can't
take care of ourselves,

18:47.594 --> 18:48.993
but there's two of us.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.062
We got to be able to help each other.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.597
How?

18:55.668 --> 18:58.270
By going wild.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.539
Dresses.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.011
Am I crazy,

19:07.013 --> 19:10.548
or are all those paint
samples the same red?

19:14.554 --> 19:17.288
Hey, boys.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.824
Whooo-hoooooo!

19:19.826 --> 19:22.160
Dispatch, I'd like to report

19:22.162 --> 19:26.030
three beautiful ladies in sundresses.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.099
All we got here is a 3-1-3.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.769
<i>Women going wild and doing what they do?</i>

19:30.771 --> 19:33.171
Yeah, I said 3-1-3.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.639
Why do we even have these codes

19:34.641 --> 19:36.107
if you insist on explaining them?

19:36.109 --> 19:37.308
<i>Well, I'll tell you why.</i>

19:37.310 --> 19:39.377
<i>Because I'm training someone.</i>

19:39.379 --> 19:40.578
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.314
Wait a minute.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.450
Put the trainee on.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.588
<i>All right, there's no trainee.</i>

19:50.590 --> 19:52.056
You never miss a beat.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.392
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da!

19:54.394 --> 19:55.594
Pah!

19:55.596 --> 19:59.798
I declare this whole night... no crimes!

19:59.800 --> 20:03.134
Now we need to figure out
what to do with Mr. Rick.

20:03.136 --> 20:06.337
What if he died again...

20:06.339 --> 20:07.939
for the first time?

20:14.948 --> 20:18.549
This previously-alive
women was just killed!

20:18.551 --> 20:19.818
Another one?

20:19.820 --> 20:21.752
Throw her in the pile in back.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.888
Okay, who ordered mozzarella sticks?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.890
I have not been writing things down.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.960
I hate when they don't
write things down.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.832
- I had a lot of fun tonight.
- So did I.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.035
I was thinking,
since we got away with this,

20:37.037 --> 20:39.770
we could make a thing of it.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.440
Go wild together once a month?

20:42.442 --> 20:43.708
Pbht! Pass.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.976
Pbht! Pbht!

20:46.046 --> 20:48.046
Just kidding. We're best friends now.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.689
"American Dad" time is over.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.825
Bye-bye. See you soon.
