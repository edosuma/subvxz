00:03.002 --> 00:05.839
{\an8}Previously on "Love &amp;
Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.905 --> 00:07.374
{\an8}You haven't
been here lately

00:07.440 --> 00:10.377
{\an7}Time is flying by,
and we always imagined
being signed by now,

00:10.443 --> 00:12.712
{\an7}and I need to figure out,
like, what I want.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.214
{\an8}I kind of want to go
to, like, a movie

00:14.280 --> 00:16.149
{\an8}or, like, do something
outside of the house.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.784
{\an7}I'm not comfortable
with that.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.120
{\an7}Being a rapper in Hollywood,
you already know that.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.522
{\an8}You're not ready to
make that commitment,

00:22.589 --> 00:24.891
{\an8}then I think
we should wrap it up.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.761
{\an7}Moniece.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.761
{\an9}Richie D.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.329
{\an8}What's up, Mo-Mo?

00:29.396 --> 00:31.731
{\an8}I can't believe
you finally made it.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.400
{\an8}So you're done with Ray.

00:33.466 --> 00:34.634
{\an8}What the (bleep) is up

00:34.701 --> 00:37.337
{\an8}with Princess getting
arrested in New Orleans?

00:37.404 --> 00:39.539
{\an8}Is the bitch
a barbarian or what?

00:39.606 --> 00:42.075
{\an8}You're disrespectful,
you're a cheater,

00:42.142 --> 00:44.177
{\an8}and you won't let me
know who you are.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.679
{\an7}If it's a relationship
that's meant to be,

00:46.746 --> 00:48.548
{\an7}you're supposed
to be happy.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.217
{\an8}You're supposed to feel
like that man is supposed
to come and protect you.

00:51.284 --> 00:54.521
{\an8}I love you to death.
What do I gotta do to
bring you back home?

00:54.587 --> 00:57.157
{\an7}First you can start off
by getting rid
of your apartment.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.793
{\an8}(bleep) that apartment.
I'm done.

00:59.859 --> 01:04.397
{\an8}Let's turn this
mother(bleep) out!

01:07.267 --> 01:08.268
{\an8}Ohh!

01:07.267 --> 01:08.268
{\an9}(bleep)

01:10.036 --> 01:11.304

01:57.650 --> 02:00.019
Me and Nia, we had
a few bumps last year,

but that's behind us,
though, we past that.

{\an8}I found out he was (bleep)
his (bleep) in a interview

{\an8}and he definitely
has a problem

02:20.540 --> 02:23.276
{\an8}keeping our personal
business off social media.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.278
But that's in the past,
we've moved on,

{\an8}I'm here, I'm feeling good,
I'm single.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.727
{\an8}I done put the Amanda BS
behind me,

02:40.793 --> 02:43.730
{\an8}the Moniece baby mama drama
behind me from last year,

02:43.796 --> 02:45.498
and things is picking up
on the music front.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.367
I got a mixtape
about to drop,

02:47.433 --> 02:49.068
and I'm next door
to Soulja right now

02:49.135 --> 02:51.137
so I'm about to holler
at him, see what's up.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.772
{\an1}What's up with you, fam?
You good?

02:52.839 --> 02:54.707
Yeah, man, you know,
living this single life

02:54.774 --> 02:56.409
so I'm trying to get
a little more work done.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.278
{\an1}Yeah.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.278
Yeah, single.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.346
{\an1}My boy single out here
in these streets.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.981
{\an5}Heard you next door,
I was trying to get
some work done.

03:02.048 --> 03:04.984
{\an8}I'm like,
"Who beatin' the door
down like that, man?"

03:05.051 --> 03:06.119
{\an8}Believe it.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.119
{\an8}What's up with you, man?

03:06.185 --> 03:07.387
{\an7}Hey, (bleep), man,
it's cool,

03:07.453 --> 03:09.889
{\an7}getting everything ready
for this tour, you feel me?

03:09.956 --> 03:12.191
I'll let y'all talk.
I'm gonna go FaceTime my baby.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.228
{\an5}I'll see you later.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.228
{\an1}Yeah.
I love you, baby.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.729
Love you, too.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.598
{\an1}Oh, (bleep).
So what's up, my (bleep)?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.266
{\an6}What's up?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.266
{\an1}You good?

03:20.333 --> 03:22.268
So what's up with
everything, man?

03:22.335 --> 03:24.704
{\an5}Man, you know,
I'm just trying to enjoy
this single life.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.573
It's been a minute
for me, you feel me?

03:26.639 --> 03:29.709
{\an5}I'm trying--
trying to find my way
with these women.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.344
{\an1}Bro, you better embrace
that single life.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.845
Man, what?
That's what I'm doing.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.181
{\an5}That's what I'm saying.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.181
I'm feelin' that.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.983
{\an5}...tied down right now.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.983
Yo, finesse.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.185
It's easy, it's just--
they everywhere.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.688
{\an1}Everywhere we go,
there's women at the shows,

03:41.754 --> 03:44.390
{\an4}there's women
on your Instagram,
on your Twitter.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.826
{\an4}It's not-- it ain't
really that hard for us
to go and look for them.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.861
{\an1}They-- They finding us,
you feel me?

03:48.928 --> 03:50.029
How you bouncin', man?

03:50.096 --> 03:51.798
You ain't got
no side piece?

03:51.864 --> 03:54.233
{\an5}I mean, I got it--
I mean, I got it all
figured out, bro.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.971
{\an4}You feel me? This is like,
Nia is my main girl,
you dig what I'm saying?

03:58.037 --> 03:59.539
{\an1}She's my ride or die,
that's my girl

03:59.606 --> 04:01.207
{\an1}and everybody know
she my girl,

04:01.274 --> 04:03.376
{\an4}but this is, like,
bro, when I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.845
{\an6}Right.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.845
{\an1}But she know that,
though, you feel me?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.714
{\an5}And I can't really be hot--

04:05.912 --> 04:07.714
So she just accepts it?

04:07.780 --> 04:09.716
{\an1}Yeah, I mean,
it's not about accepting,

04:09.782 --> 04:12.185
{\an1}it's just like she
understands what it is.

04:12.251 --> 04:14.187
Now, ain't nobody
crazy out here.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.922
When I'm on the road
doing shows,

04:15.989 --> 04:17.957
Nia knows there's
other girls out there,

04:18.024 --> 04:19.425
but that's just
road treats, though.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.194
I don't feel the same way
about them

04:21.260 --> 04:23.529
like I feel about Nia,
and she know that.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.431
{\an5}And that's what I appreciate
about her, you know
what I'm saying?

04:25.498 --> 04:27.100
She understanding of me.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.969
{\an4}So that's why I'm holding her
down 100 million percent,
you feel me?

04:30.036 --> 04:31.771
{\an5}Now that's real, man.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.771
I'mma ride with her.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.640
Keeping it authentic
like that, you know?

04:33.706 --> 04:34.974
{\an1}That's how you do that, man.
Real talk, yo.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.843
{\an1}We gotta get
in the studio.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.244
Yeah, man, stop beating
these walls down

04:38.311 --> 04:40.647
{\an5}so I can get some work done.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.647
I got you, I got you.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.482
{\an5}All right, man.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.482
Believe that.

04:42.548 --> 04:46.486
{\an8}♪

04:52.659 --> 04:54.327
(Rich)
I know it sounds crazy,

04:54.394 --> 04:56.162
but I'm really falling
for Moniece.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.930
In all my days of
Hugh Heff-in' around,

04:57.997 --> 05:00.933
{\an8}I never thought I'd catch these
type of feelings for a woman.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.435
Don't mess up
my hair, Rich.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.370
Whatever, Mo-Mo.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.441
{\an1}Welcome,
Casa de Dollaz.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.344
{\an5}Let's go outside,
got a little situation
set up for you.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.513
Super cute. Aww!

05:13.579 --> 05:16.182
{\an5}Have a seat.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.182
Love you.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.550
This week
I'm testing the waters

05:17.617 --> 05:18.985
to see if me and Mo-Mo
have what it takes

05:19.052 --> 05:20.620
to make this
a long-term thing,

05:20.687 --> 05:24.057
{\an5}but tonight, it's time
for a long-overdue
dinner for two

05:24.123 --> 05:25.958
and a little Mo-Mo
for dessert.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.694
You're here,
in the flesh.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.995
I'm in L.A.,
in the flesh.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.997
{\an5}No more FaceTime.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.997
No more FaceTime.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.166
{\an1}Are you gonna stay
forever?

05:33.232 --> 05:35.134
I'm gonna stay
for a week.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.569
I got this place
for a week.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.171
Baby steps.
This is all--

05:38.237 --> 05:40.840
this whole thing
is-- is...

05:40.907 --> 05:42.308
is new,
you understand?

05:42.375 --> 05:44.343
Having a girlfriend.

05:44.410 --> 05:47.013
{\an5}So this is a trial week?

05:44.410 --> 05:47.013
No, it's not a trial week.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.881
{\an5}I love you to death,
it's not a trial week.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.881
No, I know, but I'm--

05:48.948 --> 05:51.217
{\an1}you know that I want you
to move here.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.720
{\an5}Hopefully.
Let's see what happens
after a week.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.189
Let's address this again
at the end of the week.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.391
{\an8}I must admit,
Rich's reputation

05:58.458 --> 06:00.760
{\an8}as a member of the New York
creep squad

06:00.827 --> 06:02.361
{\an8}definitely precedes him,

06:02.428 --> 06:05.331
but creepy Rich is...
(imitates gunshots)

06:05.398 --> 06:07.200
...dead and gone, sister.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.502
I'm definitely not your
average Build-A-Bitch

06:09.569 --> 06:11.170
that Rich is used
to dating in the past,

06:11.237 --> 06:12.805
so if he wants to be
with me

06:12.872 --> 06:14.974
he's gonna have to do
things the right way,

06:15.041 --> 06:16.509
which is my way.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.044
And I don't see that
being a problem

06:18.111 --> 06:20.580
because he definitely knows
that I'm worth it.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.116
{\an1}You've got to meet
my family.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.319
{\an1}And you've got--
we have to talk about

06:26.385 --> 06:29.522
{\an4}how we're gonna integrate
Cameron into this
whole situation.

06:29.589 --> 06:33.126
I can't live with you
and not lose Cameron.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.994
It's got the candles,
the rose petals,

06:35.061 --> 06:37.730
the fancy dinner, it's
very, very, very sexy,

06:37.797 --> 06:40.600
and all of a sudden it takes
this ill turn to the left.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.101
What is going on
right now?

06:42.168 --> 06:44.537
Your mom, Cameron,

06:44.604 --> 06:46.706
I'm not opposed
to any of that.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.274
All that should
come in time.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.109
{\an5}Well, I have a question.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.109
{\an3}Shoot.

06:50.176 --> 06:52.311
{\an1}You know how I feel
about babies.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.715
{\an1}Not really
wanting any more,

06:55.782 --> 06:57.450
so I was thinking

06:57.517 --> 07:00.686
maybe you should
have a vasectomy.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.389
What?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.389
(chuckling)

07:03.456 --> 07:05.024
Like, why are you
(bleep) up my moment?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.359
Like, what are you
doing right now?

07:06.425 --> 07:07.360
You trying to make me--

07:07.426 --> 07:09.328
like, my (bleep)
not (bleep)?

07:09.395 --> 07:11.164
{\an4}No.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.164
But you are,
it gotta be.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.499
{\an5}No, you don't,
because what you
talking about

07:13.566 --> 07:15.301
{\an5}is (bleep)--

07:13.566 --> 07:15.301
Why are you yelling?

07:15.368 --> 07:17.570
{\an5}The (bleep) that you
discuss-- the (bleep)
that you talking about

07:17.637 --> 07:19.672
is (bleep) that keeps
(bleep) going soft.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.741
{\an1}Okay, fine,
let's start over.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.075
{\an5}No, we can't.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.075
Yeah, we can
start over.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.310
{\an5}No, we can't.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.310
Yes, we can.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.845
{\an5}No, we can't.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.845
Yes, we can.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.613
I know I can be
a lot to handle,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.216
{\an5}but for the sake of
getting our romantic dinner
back on track

07:30.283 --> 07:32.151
I can press pause
on all the heavy stuff,

07:32.218 --> 07:34.153
but we definitely need
to have this conversation

07:34.220 --> 07:35.721
sooner rather than later.

07:35.788 --> 07:39.492
{\an1}Thank you, muffin,
for coming all this way.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.694
{\an5}Vasectomy, my (bleep)?

07:39.559 --> 07:41.694
I love you.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.095
{\an5}That's my treat for you?

07:41.761 --> 07:43.095
{\an1}Yeah.

07:43.162 --> 07:46.999
♪

07:51.070 --> 07:53.472
Miss Nikki baby and I
have joined forces

07:53.539 --> 07:55.274
to put together
a fashion show

07:55.341 --> 07:58.644
to show off my blazer line
and her lingerie collection.

07:58.711 --> 07:59.979
{\an8}But before we storm the runway

08:00.046 --> 08:02.515
{\an8}we need a little
extra help to make it hot.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.384
{\an8}Hi.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.320
{\an8}How are you?

08:05.451 --> 08:07.320
{\an8}Good.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.422
{\an5}Hello.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.422
{\an1}Hi, Nikki,
nice to meet you.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.691
Nice to meet you too.
Hi, baby.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.827
{\an5}I met Nas on the set
of this movie called
"The Lottery Ticket",

08:14.894 --> 08:17.330
and I know she manages
a bevy of models,

08:17.396 --> 08:19.031
so I decided to reach out

08:19.098 --> 08:22.568
{\an5}to see if she can
get us some hot ones
to work the runway.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.437
So, let me tell you what
we were thinking about.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.906
{\an6}Okay.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.906
So I'm putting together
a fashion show,

08:26.973 --> 08:29.809
and I'm doing it with Nikki,
Nikki has her thing, too, so.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.178
{\an7}I'm doing a lingerie line,
My Nikki Girls,

08:32.245 --> 08:33.712
{\an8}I'm going to serve 'em.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.381
So we're just gonna collab
some type of over the top,

08:36.448 --> 08:37.717
{\an1}some type of
poppin'-ass show.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.385
{\an5}Yes, glamorous.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.385
That's gonna be
so dope.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.255
And I know you know
a lot of pretty girls.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.489
{\an8}Yes, I have 'em all.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.891
{\an8}Whatever you need
I got you.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.126
{\an8}Yes. So what's been
going on with you?

08:47.193 --> 08:50.496
{\an5}So much.
Like, I have a boot camp
called Handsome Fitness.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.099
So I've been, like,
really working on that

08:53.165 --> 08:55.501
and just getting that
rolling, you know.

08:55.568 --> 08:56.903
{\an4}Yeah.

08:55.568 --> 08:56.903
But my mind just been,

08:56.969 --> 08:58.170
like,
all over the place.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.605
I have guy troubles.

08:59.672 --> 09:02.808
{\an5}Girl, who don't have
guy troubles? (bleep)

08:59.672 --> 09:02.808
{\an3}I know.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.044
So what's going on
in guy land? I'm interested.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.647
I have to live through you
'cause I'm single right now.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.617
{\an5}Just a lot, like,
I've been on and off
with, um, Soulja Boy.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.921
{\an5}What?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.921
Yeah, I know.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.188
I thought he was with Nia.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.457
{\an1}Me too, 'cause Nia is
my friend, so I was like--

09:18.524 --> 09:19.692
My understanding,
they're together.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.460
...that they
broke up, yeah.

09:21.527 --> 09:25.665
{\an5}Um, well, I've been
on and off with Dre
for years.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.834
{\an5}I really don't know
what to think about Nas
and Soulja Boy's situation.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.037
I mean, it could be possible
that she's talking to him,

09:31.103 --> 09:34.307
{\an5}but as far as I know
every time I see Nia
and Soulja together

09:34.373 --> 09:35.808
they look like
a happy couple.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.144
I'm definitely gonna have
to verify this information

09:38.210 --> 09:40.413
before I believe
anything that she says.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.948
Nia and I used to be
best friends.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.716
{\an5}Okay.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.716
I met Dre through her.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.484
Like, they had
a little fling,

09:45.551 --> 09:48.287
and him and I were just,
like, we were friends

09:48.354 --> 09:51.590
and they broke up,
one thing led to another,

09:51.657 --> 09:54.794
{\an5}and we were dealing with
each other on and off
throughout the years.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.396
But she's been on and off
with him for years, too,

09:57.463 --> 10:00.266
so when you're on she's off,
and when she's on you're off?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.034
{\an6}No.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.034
Hold on, pause.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.570
{\an4}What is the tea?
Are you and him (bleep)
or what, girl?

10:04.637 --> 10:06.806
{\an1}'Cause I'd like to know
the juicy question (bleep).

10:06.872 --> 10:08.874
We definitely were,
a couple-- two weeks ago.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.711
{\an5}So he still texts you?

10:08.941 --> 10:11.711
Yeah, he's still
texting me.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.648
{\an5}Yes, he still texts me,
he still (bleep) to me,
like--

10:15.715 --> 10:17.750
{\an5}At the end of the day
he still tells me
that he loves me,

10:17.817 --> 10:20.319
{\an5}so just-- I don't really
know what to do because
I do love him.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.821
{\an4}I can give you
a little advice.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.821
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.789
{\an1}If he's
flaunting her around

10:23.856 --> 10:25.658
{\an1}and things aren't
adding up on your end,

10:25.725 --> 10:27.760
{\an1}so you need to
subtract yourself.

10:27.827 --> 10:28.995
{\an3}Right.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.998
{\an1}Well, we got
so disordered.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.434
{\an4}Are you sure you're
gonna be able to find
the models for us, honey?

10:35.501 --> 10:37.436
'Cause you got
a lot going on.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.205
{\an5}Whatever
you're looking for
I can get you.

10:39.271 --> 10:41.107
{\an1}And at the end we want
to walk down the runway,

10:41.173 --> 10:42.341
so I was gonna say to you--

10:42.408 --> 10:44.243
I heard you talk about
a boot camp.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.846
{\an6}Yes.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.846
Maybe you can
get us together.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.148
{\an5}So y'all have to come
and bring whoever
you want to bring.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.516
{\an5}Okay.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.516
{\an1}Okay.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.318
Well, cheers to
Handsome Fitness.

could just be ourselves?

11:00.226 --> 11:02.828

take that step yet with you.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.663

happy to me,

14:42.781 --> 14:45.784
{\an5}I got rights, bitch,
the right to (bleep)
that D.

14:45.851 --> 14:48.120
What D?
Can you tell me?

14:48.187 --> 14:50.222
(bleep) it, it's Rich.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.493
{\an5}I know you ain't saying
what I think you said.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.493
{\an3}I am.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.729
'Cause I know his reputation,
let's not get it twisted.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.897
Is this a serious thing
or is it--

14:58.964 --> 14:59.999
Seven months serious.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.834
Seven months?
That's good.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.837
I'm just gonna
go home and...

15:04.903 --> 15:08.674
pop it like a pretty pony
on the D for Richie D.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.377
TMI. You talking too much
about your sex life, bitch.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.045
{\an4}Oh!

15:11.443 --> 15:13.045
(Moniece laughing)

15:13.112 --> 15:15.214
What's going on with you
in lovers' limbo?

15:15.281 --> 15:19.418
{\an4}We're still broken up,
but we did go to the studio
recently together.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.388
{\an1}And the weird thing is
whenever we're in the studio

15:22.454 --> 15:24.990
{\an1}we've just got this connection
like it's just there.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.126
{\an4}Like, I feel like
we're actually,
like, a couple again,

15:27.192 --> 15:28.761
even though we're not.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.896
All I can say, because
I don't know the details

15:30.963 --> 15:32.998
or the depth of
your situation,

15:33.065 --> 15:34.933
a person's actions
will always show you

15:35.000 --> 15:36.769
what their mouth
doesn't say.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.238
{\an1}We have this thing coming up
for my daughter Zoe.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.639
{\an1}He's supposed
to meet me there.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.608
You know, I'm just hoping
that, you know, this time

15:42.675 --> 15:44.643
{\an1}he will be the man
that I want him to be.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.346
{\an8}Miles and I have been
broken up for a while now,

15:47.413 --> 15:50.282
{\an8}but he's always been there
for Zoe like a father figure.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.950
And when the three of us
are together,

15:52.017 --> 15:54.687
I can't help but think about
what we could have been

15:54.753 --> 15:57.423
or deep down
what I still want.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.558
Let me tell y'all about
this pamper party.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.960
{\an4}Okay, yes.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.960
I was expecting something

16:02.027 --> 16:04.163
totally different
from what I got.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.331
What went down?

16:05.397 --> 16:06.932
He needed to be cordial
with Princess,

16:06.999 --> 16:10.169
so something that I brought up
hit a nerve with her.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.037
She just start crying.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.372
Cry me a river, ho.

16:13.439 --> 16:14.807
{\an5}So listen--

16:13.439 --> 16:14.807
And go with the stream.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.041
And go, go, go.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.776
I've always been
Team TeaTea,

16:17.843 --> 16:20.512
and Princess came around
and started banging Ray

16:20.579 --> 16:22.581
while he was with Teairra,

16:22.648 --> 16:24.883
and I personally don't
(bleep) with bitches

16:24.950 --> 16:26.685
who get down like that.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.287
I was like,
"Do you want a hug?"

16:28.354 --> 16:30.255
And we did have
a sensitive moment.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.524
But when I walked away
from the moment

16:32.591 --> 16:36.528
I felt like "(bleep) her
and (bleep) him."

16:36.595 --> 16:37.830
They didn't give
a (bleep) about me,

16:37.896 --> 16:39.965
{\an5}they kicked me
when I was down.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.965
{\an3}Hallelu.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.234
She also hit me
to have drinks.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.337
Hopefully she's not
on some bull(bleep).

16:45.404 --> 16:46.672
{\an3}She is.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.274
I don't know what games
Princess might be up to,

16:49.341 --> 16:50.509
but two can play 'em.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.845
Honestly, I think
it's time for some karma

16:52.911 --> 16:55.581
to slap Princess and Ray
across the face.

16:55.647 --> 17:00.219
{\an5}So as they say:
keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.987
I could go
and meet with her,

17:02.054 --> 17:04.156
but what's gonna happen
when she meets with me?

17:04.223 --> 17:07.126
Is her man gonna like that?
Is he gonna appreciate that?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.528
Who cares?
Just be on the lookout

17:09.595 --> 17:12.765
because something about
this whole situation

17:12.830 --> 17:14.700
rubs me the wrong way.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.702
Actually,
you may be right.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.069
(fake coughs)
Bitch is a tramp.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.906
And she may be trying
to play me in some form,

17:20.973 --> 17:24.076
{\an5}and I don't know
why she would even think
that she could play me

17:24.143 --> 17:25.844
when I have nothing
to lose.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.780
You have everything
to lose, baby.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.284
{\an8}Some girl,
her name is Nas,

17:32.351 --> 17:34.486
{\an7}she's like her and Soulja
are in love with each other

17:34.553 --> 17:37.055
{\an8}and that's her man.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.055
{\an8}This bitch.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.858
{\an7}I've literally been
in the house for two years.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.493
{\an8}You can come out
with me.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.296
{\an7}I don't really care what Ray
feels right now, I'm doing me.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.838
♪

17:58.477 --> 18:01.513
{\an8}After I went to lunch with
TeaTea and her acquaintance Nas,

18:01.580 --> 18:04.049
{\an5}I was shocked to hear
that she said she's
(bleep) with Soulja.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.651
So I decided
to check in with Nia

18:05.717 --> 18:07.953
{\an5}to make sure
that she was clued in
on this situation.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.855
{\an5}These are cute.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.855
They look small,
though.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.223
{\an1}They are.
They are small.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.058
Okay, this is a medium.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.893
These conversations
are never easy,

18:14.960 --> 18:16.762
but I will always keep it real
and let my friend know

18:16.829 --> 18:18.464
if another woman
is speaking on her,

18:18.530 --> 18:21.266
{\an8}especially if she's claiming
to be messing around
with her man.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.802
{\an8}I'm happy we finally
got out the house
and went shopping.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.604
I know, I always need
to get out the house.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.673
And I got some tea
to tell you, too.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.475
What's the tea?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.376
{\an5}I went to go out
with Teairra
the other day,

18:31.443 --> 18:33.378
{\an5}we went to brunch
or whatever...

18:31.443 --> 18:33.378
{\an1}Okay.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.713
{\an5}We had, like,
a meeting with
this girl

18:34.780 --> 18:37.716
{\an5}and I'm sitting down
and she's, like,
telling us,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.052
{\an5}"Oh, you know,
I'm messing around
with Soulja."

18:40.118 --> 18:43.422
{\an5}She's like her and
Soulja are in love
with each other

18:43.489 --> 18:45.891
{\an5}and that's her man.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.891
That's her man?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.559
{\an5}And, you know,
you're my friend,
my loyalty's with you,

18:47.626 --> 18:49.862
so that's why I'm just
letting you know, so--

18:49.928 --> 18:52.331
{\an1}Who are you talking about?
Do you know her name?

18:52.397 --> 18:53.999
Some girl,
her name is Nas.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.335
Oh, my God,
this bitch.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.403
{\an8}This Raggedy Ann looking bitch,

18:58.470 --> 18:59.972
{\an8}I thought I was done
with her,

19:00.038 --> 19:02.808
{\an8}but here she goes popping up
back in the scene again.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.110
{\an5}And then this is where
things get really
bizarre with her,

19:05.177 --> 19:07.846
{\an5}'cause she starts
saying, um, that
y'all are friends

19:07.913 --> 19:09.348
and y'all used
to live together.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.717
{\an5}And she's all,
"Well, Nia is--
was my friend."

19:11.783 --> 19:13.752
{\an1}Yeah, we were friends.
I stopped being her friend.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.320
That was years ago.

19:15.387 --> 19:18.257
Yes, we were friends
years ago back in Atlanta,

19:18.323 --> 19:21.360
and she met Dre through me
when he was my (bleep).

19:21.426 --> 19:23.395
And when Dre and I
took a break

19:23.462 --> 19:26.999
my "friend" slid her
flat ass right on in there.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.835
{\an5}Whatever that was,
that was then
and this is now,

19:29.902 --> 19:33.038
{\an5}and that thirsty thought
is willing to do any
and everything

19:33.105 --> 19:36.542
to be on top or be famous,
that's what she does.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.176
She just wants attention

19:38.243 --> 19:40.646
{\an1}and she wants what we have
going on right now,

19:40.712 --> 19:42.180
{\an1}and that's all
I can really say.

19:42.247 --> 19:45.117
{\an5}Like, some women
are, you know, okay
with being exclusive

19:45.183 --> 19:47.219
{\an5}and some are okay
with being in open
relationships.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.488
So, like, how are
you guys exactly?

19:49.555 --> 19:52.024
{\an4}Dealing with
somebody like Dre,
and you know, too,

19:52.090 --> 19:54.393
{\an1}like, a lot comes
with that (bleep), too,

19:54.459 --> 19:57.062
{\an4}but you know how many
bitches I would have
to say something to

19:57.129 --> 19:58.997
{\an1}if somebody wants
to come out of nowhere

19:59.064 --> 20:01.400
{\an1}and be like, "Oh, I'm
sleeping with your man"?

20:01.466 --> 20:02.701
{\an5}Anybody could say that.

20:01.466 --> 20:02.701
{\an3}Of course.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.570
I have to wonder
what's going on with Nia.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.673
{\an5}She's a little bit too calm
about this situation
with Nas and Soulja.

20:07.739 --> 20:10.475
If that was my situation,
I would be acting a damn fool.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.145
At the end of the day,
I'm with him every day,

20:13.211 --> 20:15.547
{\an1}I'm home with him,
like, I know my place.

20:15.614 --> 20:19.184
{\an5}Okay, so as I was
leaving the conversation
with her,

20:19.251 --> 20:23.288
{\an5}she told me that
she was gonna have
this little boot camp.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.856
{\an1}Like she's teaching
the boot camp?

20:24.923 --> 20:26.792
{\an5}I guess.
She said she's like
a fitness instructor.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.260
She's a fit-- really?
When did that happen?

20:28.327 --> 20:29.695
Girl, you know,
that's not my friend.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.663
I'm just telling you
she invited me,

20:31.730 --> 20:34.066
{\an5}so I don't know
if you have anything
to say to her.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.701
I want to see what
she has to say...

20:35.767 --> 20:37.336
{\an6}Right.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.336
to my face.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.604
And as you should.
I would.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.472
Ho-larious.

20:40.539 --> 20:44.543
♪

20:48.647 --> 20:50.682
Mo-Mo can be wacky
as hell sometimes,

20:50.749 --> 20:53.285
{\an8}talking about
neutering your boy and
meeting her moms and all,

20:53.352 --> 20:56.221
{\an8}but overall she's been
putting in big effort
to keep me happy,

20:56.288 --> 20:57.856
especially
in the bedroom.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.825
{\an1}Richie D.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.360
The more time we hang out

21:01.426 --> 21:02.561
the more I fall
for this girl,

21:02.628 --> 21:04.162
but if we're really
gonna be serious

21:04.229 --> 21:07.933
there's just this one thing
I gotta get off my chest.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.737
{\an5}So we're contemplating
this serious, serious
relationship.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.372
{\an1}So now we're just
contemplating?

21:13.438 --> 21:15.974
{\an5}I thought we were
serious, serious.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.974
No, listen-- can I finish?

21:16.041 --> 21:17.943
{\an5}I'm here in L.A.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.943
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.344
I'm with my Mo-Mo D.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.114
You know what
bothers me, though?

21:22.180 --> 21:25.217
That tat. That tat
bothers me, my G.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.752
{\an1}Why?

21:25.283 --> 21:26.752
It bothers me--

21:26.818 --> 21:28.587
{\an5}Because it's like
'cause I'm looking
at you

21:28.654 --> 21:31.490
{\an5}and as we're being
intimate...

21:28.654 --> 21:31.490
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

21:31.556 --> 21:32.958
I feel like
I'm sharing you

21:33.025 --> 21:35.260
with the guy that's
on your hip.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.262
{\an5}But you're not.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.262
That gotta go, homes.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.898
{\an8}So I got this tattoo
on my hip when I was 18

21:39.965 --> 21:42.100
{\an8}of my first partner,
first boyfriend,

21:42.167 --> 21:45.437
{\an8}first for everything,
and I never covered it up,

21:45.504 --> 21:47.973
so I don't really see why
it's such a big deal.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.642
{\an1}But I grew a baby
with baby daddy

21:50.709 --> 21:53.045
{\an1}and he felt some type of way
and I didn't cover it up.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.480
{\an5}I know, so I mean,
what you saying?
You comparing the two?

21:55.547 --> 21:57.516
The tattoo really
shouldn't be that big of a deal,

21:57.582 --> 21:59.384
but since it bothers Rich
so much

21:59.451 --> 22:01.420
I'm waving my white flag,
I'm giving in,

22:01.486 --> 22:02.854
and I'm getting rid of it.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.357
But homeboy better be making
some concessions, too.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.193
{\an1}I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf, just like you.

22:09.394 --> 22:11.797
And this is permanent.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.400
{\an1}This is a forever
kind of love,

22:15.467 --> 22:20.305
so I will oblige you
because I love you,

22:20.372 --> 22:21.973
and I will cover it.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.011
And now that I've agreed
to cover up the tattoo...

22:26.078 --> 22:30.015
{\an1}I'm thinking
you should stay...

22:30.082 --> 22:31.483
{\an1}forever.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.020
I should have known Moniece
had something up her sleeve

22:35.087 --> 22:36.922
if she was gonna go back
under the gun for me.

22:36.988 --> 22:39.825
I mean, I'm in love and I'm
definitely down for the ride

22:39.891 --> 22:43.762
but the word "forever" is
just not quite in my vocabulary.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.430
So far so good.

22:45.497 --> 22:46.698
I'm bicoastal right now.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.667
{\an5}I don't like it.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.667
And we're working on

22:48.734 --> 22:51.069
making this a much
bigger situation.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.506
{\an4}I know what will help you
make the decision
so much faster--

22:54.573 --> 22:56.875
{\an1}a high-performance
snapbox session.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.877
So let's get to it.

23:05.217 --> 23:09.287
{\an8}After I caught Ray turned up
at his APT party I was furious.

23:09.354 --> 23:11.223
{\an8}Now I'm not moving out
just yet,

23:11.289 --> 23:13.658
but I have decided
to live my own life.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.794
Hi.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.794
{\an1}Hi!

23:15.861 --> 23:17.262
Hey.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.498
{\an5}How are you?

23:17.329 --> 23:19.498
I'm good, how are you?

23:19.564 --> 23:21.833
So I called Teairra
to meet me up for drinks

23:21.900 --> 23:23.235
and to see if she's
really genuine

23:23.301 --> 23:25.103
about what happened
at Apryl's pamper party.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.705
And if there's anybody
in this world

23:26.772 --> 23:30.008
who knows about dealing with
Ray's bull(bleep) it's her.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.676
What's up with you?

23:31.743 --> 23:34.045
{\an5}I mean, I just--

23:31.743 --> 23:34.045
You feel better
from the other night?

23:34.112 --> 23:37.849
{\an1}What you said to me, like,
it really touched me.

23:37.916 --> 23:42.487
{\an5}I've been
in your situation
time after time.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.223
{\an4}At first it was about
being cordial...

23:42.554 --> 23:45.223
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

23:45.290 --> 23:48.193
I-- Like, I really--
I feel like we could,

23:48.260 --> 23:49.961
{\an5}you know...

23:48.260 --> 23:49.961
{\an3}Be friends?

23:50.028 --> 23:51.296
{\an1}Yeah.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.296
{\an3}Say it.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.231
{\an5}Yeah, be friends.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.231
{\an3}(laughing)

23:53.298 --> 23:56.301
{\an5}Okay,
that's funny to me
because, I mean,

23:56.368 --> 23:57.636
you know
where we started.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.938
{\an1}Yeah. I've always been
the type of person,

24:00.005 --> 24:02.507
{\an1}If I'm dealing with someone
I trust them.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.142
Like, you know?

24:02.574 --> 24:04.142
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

24:04.209 --> 24:07.312
{\an8}If Princess
wants to be friendly,
then I'm down to play.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.414
{\an8}But don't think I won't
have my guard up,

24:09.481 --> 24:13.251
and if I see something that
I can use to my advantage

24:13.318 --> 24:14.853
you best believe I will.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.923
So where you are
right now in your life.

24:17.989 --> 24:21.893
I'm just seeing everything
for what it is, you know?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.695
I need you
to tell me more.

24:23.762 --> 24:26.097
{\an1}Basically I have
one foot out the door.

24:26.164 --> 24:29.067
{\an6}Mm-hmm.

24:26.164 --> 24:29.067
One more incident

24:29.134 --> 24:31.770
{\an1}is gonna cause me to
just go over the edge.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.338
One more, huh?

24:31.837 --> 24:33.338
{\an1}Yeah.

24:33.405 --> 24:36.274
One more incident, huh?
Let's see how true that is.

24:36.341 --> 24:39.578
{\an5}Right now I'm just
feeling Princess out,
taking mental notes.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.980
I'm still hurt about the way
Ray did me last year.

24:42.047 --> 24:44.049
So I gotta admit
it feels good to see

24:44.115 --> 24:47.018
that his glittering
relationship ain't solid gold.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.387
{\an5}What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna stay
in the relationship?

24:49.454 --> 24:50.889
Like, what's gonna happen?

24:50.956 --> 24:53.625
{\an4}I don't think I'mma see
a ring on my finger
any time soon,

24:53.692 --> 24:56.328
{\an4}So it's-- it's--
I'm at that--

24:53.692 --> 24:56.328
Probably not.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.297
You know I've literally been
in the house for two years.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.066
L.A. is not my hometown.

25:01.132 --> 25:04.102
I moved out here specifically
just to be with Ray,

25:04.169 --> 25:05.871
but he likes
his girls at home.

25:05.937 --> 25:08.874
{\an5}So I've been cooped up
in the house for the past
two years.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.508
It's time for me
to get out the house

25:10.575 --> 25:12.410
and start living
my own life.

25:12.477 --> 25:13.879
Can I give you
some advice?

25:13.945 --> 25:16.047
{\an4}Please do.

25:13.945 --> 25:16.047
You know, you gotta
be your own woman.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.582
Are you, like,
on house arrest?

25:17.649 --> 25:19.251
{\an4}No.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.251
(chuckles) Okay.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.586
{\an5}Well, tonight,
Drake's having
a party at his house.

25:21.653 --> 25:23.488
If you want to roll
you can roll.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.523
Girl, you gotta
get out more.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.425
{\an4}I know.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.425
You should. I go out
all the time.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.327
{\an5}You can come out
with me.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.327
{\an1}Really?

25:29.394 --> 25:31.363
{\an6}Absolutely.

25:29.394 --> 25:31.363
{\an1}I'll come.

25:31.429 --> 25:35.200
{\an4}I don't really care
what Ray feels right now,
I'm doing me.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.035
{\an5}Well, that's what
you should do.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.035
{\an1}Yeah.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.337
That's what
you should do.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.073
{\an8}If you want to talk to me
like a grown-ass (bleep)
woman then do so.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.675
{\an8}Back up. Back up.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.675
{\an8}Do it. Then touch me.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.076
{\an8}Then do it, bitch.
Do it, do it.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.444

29:52.690 --> 29:56.294
{\an4}It got out of hand, and

{\an5}Can we go back inside?

30:04.469 --> 30:07.205

30:07.272 --> 30:09.140
No, you can't go out.

30:15.046 --> 30:17.215

you're going back
inside and changing.

{\an1}(scoffs)
No, I'm not.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.857

I talked to Teairra,

30:25.924 --> 30:28.326
She has an interesting
perspective.

30:28.393 --> 30:31.362
{\an5}Now she's been through
all of this bull(bleep)
with Ray before,

30:31.429 --> 30:34.299
{\an5}and she's right--
I need to stand up

30:34.365 --> 30:36.701

30:36.768 --> 30:39.270

30:39.337 --> 30:41.739

30:53.351 --> 30:56.254
Like, look, I don't know what
kind of game you trying to play,

30:56.321 --> 30:57.322
but I ain't with it.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.257
Yo.

30:59.324 --> 31:01.426
What the (bleep), man?

31:01.492 --> 31:03.895
{\an8}I'm hoping that your heart
and your mind are with me,

31:03.962 --> 31:06.564
{\an7}so I want
to move in together.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.132
{\an8}What?

31:08.199 --> 31:10.301
{\an8}Princess was telling me
that she talked to you.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.469
{\an7}What are y'all doing
to each other?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.338
{\an8}At the end of the day.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.173
{\an8}I just got a lot
to think about.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.316
♪

31:27.752 --> 31:30.221
{\an8}(Moniece)
Rich has expressed that this
tiny tattoo on my hip

31:30.288 --> 31:32.924
is really bothering him,
so, in the interest of our

31:32.991 --> 31:35.293
loving relationship
and in the best interests

31:35.360 --> 31:37.829
of me getting my ring,

31:37.895 --> 31:39.597
I'm gonna go ahead
and oblige him.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.766
{\an5}(man)
So, the cover-up
we're doing.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.401
It's on my hip.

31:43.468 --> 31:44.669
Okay.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.838
It's my ex's initial.

31:46.904 --> 31:48.773
{\an6}All right.

31:46.904 --> 31:48.773
Then like a little crown.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.241
{\an1}So I wanna do,
like, a butterfly.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.143
Good, do you wanna come
over back here.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.344
{\an4}Sure.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.344
And we just need to check out

31:53.411 --> 31:55.146
the size, the placement,
and all that.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.581
{\an5}(Moniece)
This is definitely a game
of tit-for-tat.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.450
{\an8}So I'm hoping that he'll
give me something

31:59.517 --> 32:00.551
{\an8}that I want from him,

32:00.618 --> 32:03.554
{\an8}which is him in L.A...

32:03.621 --> 32:06.257
forever...
with me...

32:06.324 --> 32:08.726
and my ring... and my house.

32:08.793 --> 32:11.062
Lord Jesus,
'cause I need it all.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.464
{\an1}Before I get my tattoo,
I have a question.

32:13.531 --> 32:14.766
{\an3}What?

32:14.832 --> 32:17.602
{\an1}Why is it so important
to you that I cover this up?

32:17.669 --> 32:19.237
Honestly, I didn't
care if you did,

32:19.304 --> 32:20.505
because if you said no,
I would have to be

32:20.571 --> 32:21.806
okay with that, right?

32:21.873 --> 32:23.541
But the fact
that you would

32:23.608 --> 32:24.909
lets me know
where your mind's at.

32:24.976 --> 32:25.943
{\an5}It lets me know that--

32:24.976 --> 32:25.943
{\an1}Yeah.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.712
{\an1}My mind and my heart
are with you.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.247
{\an1}And your heart.
And they're in a good place.

32:29.314 --> 32:30.615
{\an5}So let's knock that out.

32:29.314 --> 32:30.615
{\an1}Okay.

32:30.682 --> 32:31.849
But I'm not done yet.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.184
{\an6}He's ready.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.184
So-- but wait.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.652
{\an5}Come on, seriously,
he's ready.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.652
{\an1}I know.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.388
{\an1}But, seriously,
I'm gonna do this because,

32:37.455 --> 32:39.223
{\an1}like I said, my heart
and my mind are with you.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.126
I'm hoping that your heart
and your mind are with me.

32:42.193 --> 32:44.796
{\an1}So I want
to move in together.

32:44.862 --> 32:46.364
What?!

32:46.431 --> 32:48.366
{\an5}(Rich)
Yo, this is not even
an even trade.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.735
{\an8}You get an old tattoo covered up

32:50.802 --> 32:54.005
{\an8}definitely don't mean we about
to sign this lease together.

32:54.072 --> 32:55.740
I ain't ready to move in
with nobody.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.709
{\an5}Do you hear this?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.709
{\an1}So I--

32:57.775 --> 32:59.844
Do you-- no, seriously.
Do you condone this?

32:59.911 --> 33:00.912
Ah, it's a big decision.

33:00.978 --> 33:02.246
This is a big
decision, too.

33:02.313 --> 33:05.817
This is a permanent,
never-going-away--

33:05.883 --> 33:07.318
{\an5}You're good, though.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.318
You can move
out of a house--

33:07.385 --> 33:08.653
No, seriously,
you're good.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.821
{\an5}So, in other words...

33:08.720 --> 33:09.821
Yo, come on, really, stop.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.789
{\an1}what's important to me
in moving forward...

33:11.856 --> 33:14.225
{\an5}We'll discuss it.
We'll discuss it.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.225
...with our relationship--

33:14.292 --> 33:16.094
{\an5}(man)
Okay, have we decided
yea or nay on the tattoo?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.296
{\an5}Yes on the tattoo.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.296
Oh, the tattoo's happening.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.164
{\an4}Okay!

33:18.363 --> 33:20.164
Before-- oh, there's
gonna be some (bleep)

33:20.231 --> 33:21.699
{\an5}if that tattoo
don't happen.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.699
What about--

33:21.766 --> 33:23.634
{\an4}Let's get the stencil on
and then we can discuss
this later.

33:23.701 --> 33:24.969
She has to stand up
to do this, right?

33:25.036 --> 33:25.970
{\an5}Yeah!

33:25.036 --> 33:25.970
{\an1}Yes.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.238
{\an6}Okay.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.238
Even trade.

33:27.305 --> 33:28.606
Yo, can he get to work.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.308
Oh, my God,
you're so funny.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.710
Clearly, Rich is not thinking
about all the advantages

33:32.777 --> 33:33.778
of me moving in.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.847
There's mid-week ménages.

33:35.913 --> 33:37.849
Skinny dipping
in the hot tub.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.551
I mean, with me,
the possibilities are endless.

33:40.618 --> 33:42.620
I just need to get him
at the right moment,

33:42.687 --> 33:45.156
and I know that he'll be on
the same page as me in no time.

33:45.223 --> 33:46.724
{\an1}So we're gonna have you
hit it over on this side,

33:46.791 --> 33:49.327
{\an5}and your hip--

33:46.791 --> 33:49.327
Wait, my cookie was out.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.229
Would you like
a (bleep) of a cookie?

33:51.295 --> 33:53.998
Rich? You can come home
to a (bleep) of a cookie

33:54.065 --> 33:55.433
every night, baby!

33:55.500 --> 33:57.935
Freshly waxed
little sugar cookie.

33:58.002 --> 33:59.270
This is the face
of uncomfortable.

33:59.337 --> 34:00.972
{\an1}Do you wanna do
the bread cookies, daddy?

34:01.038 --> 34:02.373
Am I supposed
to be over here?

34:02.440 --> 34:03.975
Is this against
federal regulations

34:04.041 --> 34:05.777
{\an5}for me to be over here
watching this going on?

34:04.041 --> 34:05.777
{\an1}Now it is.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.178
{\an4}(laughing)

34:05.843 --> 34:07.178
See ya! Gotta go.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.446
Babe, wait,
just answer the question!

34:08.513 --> 34:09.447
It's been real.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.982
He left me.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.683
{\an1}Ready to
rock and roll?

34:12.750 --> 34:15.018
{\an5}(Moniece)
I pushed a baby out of

{\an8}(Ray J)
Princess really
got me (bleep) up

34:25.663 --> 34:27.899
talking about Teairra
was right about me.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.699
I mean, you just came back
to the house.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.268
I thought
we was getting it right.

34:31.335 --> 34:35.206
And now you want to play these
silly-ass games with my ex?

34:35.273 --> 34:37.108
You know what? Since Princess
was keeping me in the dark

34:37.175 --> 34:39.476
with this whole Teairra
and her situation,

34:39.543 --> 34:41.446
I've arranged a meeting
for somebody else

34:41.512 --> 34:43.014
to tell me
what's happening.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.382
{\an8}You know what I'm saying?
Because somebody's

34:44.449 --> 34:45.949
{\an8}gonna keep it 100.

34:46.016 --> 34:47.351
{\an1}Hi.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.121
{\an1}What's up?

34:50.188 --> 34:51.422
(Teairra)
What a surprise.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.257
I keep Princess out all night,

34:53.324 --> 34:56.793
{\an8}and right on cue, the next day,
Ray's blowing up my phone.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.129
Ray did me dirty last year,

34:58.196 --> 35:00.398
telling lies
about me in alleyways.

35:00.465 --> 35:03.067
So I decided to meet with him
and see if I can't give him

35:03.134 --> 35:04.936
exactly what he deserves.

35:05.002 --> 35:06.437
I appreciate you
coming out here,

35:06.504 --> 35:07.905
'cause, like,

35:07.972 --> 35:10.308
Princess was telling me
that she talked to you.

35:10.374 --> 35:11.542
{\an1}Well, she didn't even tell me
she talked to you.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.444
She just told me
that you was right...

35:13.511 --> 35:15.813
{\an5}about me, and--

35:13.511 --> 35:15.813
About what?

35:15.880 --> 35:17.782
I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.150
She drove off
right after that.

35:19.217 --> 35:21.319
{\an1}I thought you wanted
to apologize to me

35:21.385 --> 35:22.653
{\an1}for the things
that you did to me.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.988
That's why I came.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.756
{\an1}You told me that you would
never hurt me again,

35:25.823 --> 35:28.159
and then, in New York,
you just kind of like

35:28.226 --> 35:30.828
threw a curveball,
and I was confused.

35:30.895 --> 35:31.963
I never would have thought

35:32.029 --> 35:33.664
that I would hear
something like that.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.566
{\an1}So you really think
that I was in the alley

35:35.633 --> 35:37.134
{\an1}(bleep) on a (bleep)?
Are you kidding me?

35:37.201 --> 35:38.202
I don't know about
in the alley.

35:38.269 --> 35:39.470
Maybe in the bedroom.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.305
{\an5}All right, all right.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.305
No, Teairra, Teairra--

35:41.372 --> 35:42.840
No, because that's
some bull(bleep).

35:42.907 --> 35:44.876
{\an1}I don't know, but it wasn't
my intention to hurt you.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.344
I just felt
like it wasn't--

35:46.410 --> 35:48.079
{\an1}But you did hurt me.
Can you own that?

35:48.145 --> 35:49.981
Okay, so if I--
and if I hurt you,

35:50.047 --> 35:51.983
{\an5}that was no my intention,
it was not.

35:50.047 --> 35:51.983
{\an1}Okay.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.084
{\an4}Yeah.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.084
That's not-- that's--

35:53.150 --> 35:54.519
That's not
who I am now.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.088
I will never forgive Ray
for the damage that he's done.

35:57.154 --> 35:58.956
I mean, he tried
to tarnish my name,

35:59.023 --> 36:00.591
and that really
(bleep) me up.

36:00.658 --> 36:01.959
I brought you out here

36:02.026 --> 36:03.995
{\an5}not to start
an issue with you...

36:02.026 --> 36:03.995
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.029
but just because
I heard some things

36:05.096 --> 36:06.197
that concerned me.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.598
{\an4}Okay.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.598
And I-- first of all,

36:07.665 --> 36:10.401
{\an1}I was like, "Teairra
and Princess talking, wow."

36:10.468 --> 36:12.803
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.803
I was uncomfortable.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.205
{\an1}Well, I don't want
to, like, impede

36:14.272 --> 36:15.473
{\an1}on your relationship
or anything,

36:15.540 --> 36:16.874
{\an1}but, you know,
we just started talking,

36:16.941 --> 36:18.142
{\an1}and it just went
where it went, you know.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.176
Where did it go, though?

36:19.243 --> 36:20.344
{\an1}She seemed very
stressed out, Ray.

36:20.411 --> 36:21.746
{\an1}I don't know what y'all
going through.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.748
Ray J's relationship
was in trouble

36:23.814 --> 36:26.017
before I started getting
friendly with Princess.

36:26.083 --> 36:28.686
But I'm sure I can
speed up the breakup process.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.321
Now that Princess and I
are friendly,

36:30.388 --> 36:32.323
I have her
right where I want her.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.791
Now it's Ray J's turn.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.426
I just got a lot
to think about.

36:35.493 --> 36:37.395
Listen, we don't ever
have to be together.

36:37.461 --> 36:40.431
But I love you enough
to let you know that

36:40.498 --> 36:42.033
I want to see you happy.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.935
{\an1}And you don't
look happy to me.

36:44.001 --> 36:45.803
{\an1}And she didn't
look happy, either.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.838
{\an1}So what are y'all
doing to each other?

36:47.905 --> 36:49.006
At the end of the day.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.542
I'm not doing nothing
to nobody.

36:51.609 --> 36:54.612
I just try to be,
you know,

36:54.679 --> 36:56.280
just try to be
a better person.

36:57.582 --> 37:00.318
{\an1}Well, that doesn't
sound too happy.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.652
{\an4}So--

37:00.384 --> 37:01.652
But if-- but look,

37:01.719 --> 37:04.055
if I call you again,
you gonna come?

37:05.656 --> 37:07.425
{\an8}We need to talk.

37:05.656 --> 37:07.425
{\an8}About what?

37:07.491 --> 37:09.060
{\an8}About our friendship
and the fact

37:09.126 --> 37:10.428
{\an8}that I'm still
dealing with Dre.

37:10.494 --> 37:11.729
{\an7}Back up.

37:10.494 --> 37:11.729
{\an8}You back up!

37:11.796 --> 37:12.997
{\an8}Gonna knock your ass out.

37:11.796 --> 37:12.997
{\an8}No, you-- then do it!

37:13.064 --> 37:14.231
{\an7}Back up.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.231
{\an8}Then touch me.

37:14.298 --> 37:15.933
{\an8}Back up, back up.

37:14.298 --> 37:15.933
{\an8}Then do it, bitch, do it!

37:22.239 --> 37:24.442
(waves crashing,
seagulls calling)

37:25.543 --> 37:26.978
{\an7}So you're just gonna
take your hands

37:27.044 --> 37:28.879
{\an8}and come all the way down.

37:28.946 --> 37:31.415
{\an8}I decided to go to Nas's
boot camp with Teairra.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.284
And I took it upon myself
to invite Apryl

37:33.351 --> 37:35.686
and, of course, Nia, so she
could finally check this bitch.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.755
{\an1}Hold this
for the other five.

37:37.822 --> 37:39.690
One, two, three...

37:39.757 --> 37:40.691
Aah!

37:40.758 --> 37:42.126
Sorry.
(laughing)

37:42.193 --> 37:44.829
I'm sorry.
I could've thrown up.

37:44.895 --> 37:46.163
Okay, should we do
that one again?

37:46.230 --> 37:49.600
{\an1}Who the (bleep)
invited Nia?

37:49.667 --> 37:52.236
Nia-- oh, (bleep).
Did you invite Nia, bitch?

37:52.303 --> 37:53.404
No, I invited Apryl.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.640
{\an1}This is gonna be
very (bleep) interesting.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.308
It may have been a little messy
for me to tell Nia

37:57.375 --> 37:58.709
what Nas was saying,

37:58.776 --> 38:00.711
but this little lava-head chick
needs to be checked.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.147
So I really don't feel bad for
inviting Nia to the boot camp

38:03.214 --> 38:05.316
and I can't wait to see her
set her straight.

38:05.383 --> 38:06.484
{\an5}Hey, bro!

38:05.383 --> 38:06.484
{\an1}Hey!

38:06.550 --> 38:07.952
{\an6}Same level.

38:06.550 --> 38:07.952
Hi, baby.

38:08.019 --> 38:08.953
Give me a hug.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.488
{\an5}Hey, boo.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.488
How are you?

38:10.554 --> 38:11.489
(Apryl)
Nice to meet you. Apryl.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.057
{\an4}So cute.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.057
Thank you.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.592
{\an5}(Nia)
I'm really trying not
to bust out laughing

38:14.659 --> 38:16.560
at this saggy-ass ho.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.962
If she's talking about Dre

38:18.029 --> 38:20.297
and being in a relationship
with him behind my back,

38:20.364 --> 38:22.333
I wanna see
what she says to my face.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.801
{\an5}We need to talk.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.801
Wait a minute, time out.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.269
{\an4}Excuse me?

38:23.868 --> 38:25.269
You heard me.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.604
We need to talk.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.239
About what?

38:28.305 --> 38:29.273
About everything.

38:29.340 --> 38:30.274
Like what, man?

38:30.341 --> 38:32.009
What-- what you mean
about what?

38:32.076 --> 38:33.577
About our friendship...

38:33.644 --> 38:36.881
Soulja...
and all of that.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.049
I wanna know
that you know her.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.316
{\an5}I know her.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.316
Okay.

38:39.383 --> 38:41.285
{\an5}And that's--

38:39.383 --> 38:41.285
Were you guys
like BFFs?

38:41.352 --> 38:42.520
At one point in life.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.722
And you want a trophy.
Like, what the (bleep)?

38:44.789 --> 38:46.190
Actually, I do.
I want a cookie.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.925
{\an5}I want all of it.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.925
{\an1}We're not friends
anymore.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.827
{\an5}And that's a fact.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.827
{\an3}Why?

38:49.894 --> 38:51.028
Let's move on in life.

38:51.095 --> 38:52.229
But it's over because--

38:52.296 --> 38:53.297
{\an1}I don't want
to see you out

38:53.364 --> 38:54.799
{\an1}and have to punch you
in your face.

38:54.865 --> 38:55.900
You're not gonna
(bleep) do that,

38:55.966 --> 38:56.967
so calm that (bleep)
the (bleep) down.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.703
You're not gonna
punch me in my face.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.337
{\an5}Stop cursing at me.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.337
Nia, we've been in
numerous spaces together.

39:00.404 --> 39:01.806
Stop cursing at me.

39:01.872 --> 39:03.340
No, but stop saying you're
gonna punch me in my face.

39:03.407 --> 39:04.875
Stop saying that,
stop (bleep) saying that.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.343
{\an1}'Cause that's not what
the (bleep) you're gonna do.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.012
{\an1}If you wanna talk to me like
a grown-ass (bleep) woman,

39:08.079 --> 39:09.380
{\an3}then do so.

39:09.447 --> 39:10.748
But all that, you gonna
punch me in my face--

39:10.815 --> 39:12.883
bitch, that's
not gonna happen.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.785
So continue
our conversation,

39:14.852 --> 39:16.020
the reason I'm not trying
to be your friend anymore,

39:16.087 --> 39:17.988
I'm not trying to be
your friend-- it's cool.

39:18.055 --> 39:20.391
But I just think that
it's really (bleep) up

39:20.458 --> 39:22.560
at, like,
the situation at hand.

39:22.626 --> 39:25.096
And the fact that I'm
still dealing with Dre.

39:25.162 --> 39:28.132
At the end of the day,
hoes get (bleep) every day.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.034
What she doesn't realize is,
if I leave Dre

39:30.101 --> 39:32.870
right this instant,
it's never gonna be her.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.205
This ho is delusional.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.440
She really thinks
her and Dre are together.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.043
She needs to back up before
she gets knocked down.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.611
How did you meet Dre?

39:40.678 --> 39:41.779
And that's all
I want to say.

39:41.846 --> 39:42.880
{\an5}How did you--

39:41.846 --> 39:42.880
No, no, no! I--

39:42.947 --> 39:44.115
No, no, no!
(bleep) (bleep) (bleep).

39:44.181 --> 39:45.950
{\an5}No, no! (bleep).

39:44.181 --> 39:45.950
Calm down, calm down.

39:46.016 --> 39:46.951
No, you calm
the (bleep) down.

39:47.017 --> 39:48.119
I was real calm.
I was real calm.

39:48.185 --> 39:49.520
I'm calm the (bleep)--
We're fine.

39:49.587 --> 39:52.289
No, I met-- you're right.
I met Dre through you.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.657
{\an5}So that's it.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.657
No, no, no, it's not it!

39:53.724 --> 39:54.658
{\an5}Time to think it over.

39:53.724 --> 39:54.658
That's not it!

39:54.725 --> 39:56.127
'Cause you (bleep) (bleep)!

39:56.193 --> 39:58.062
(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

39:58.129 --> 39:59.463
And (bleep) everybody!

39:59.530 --> 40:01.932
Do I? No, you
(bleep) them after me.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.434
{\an5}Now, you (bleep) them
after me.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.434
{\an1}Back up.

40:03.501 --> 40:04.935
{\an5}You back up!

40:03.501 --> 40:04.935
{\an1}No, you--

40:05.002 --> 40:06.370
{\an5}Back up. Back up.

40:05.002 --> 40:06.370
Then do it!
Then touch me.

40:06.437 --> 40:08.572
Then do it, bitch!
Do it!

40:08.639 --> 40:10.474
{\an1}Go fix your teeth, ho.
They rotten.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.510
{\an1}'Bout to fall out
your rotten-ass mouth!

40:12.576 --> 40:14.245
You're just (bleep)
jealous 'cause my (bleep)

40:14.311 --> 40:15.246
you kissing him!

40:15.312 --> 40:17.047
He still (bleep) (bleep)!

40:17.114 --> 40:19.083
He still is--
How do I taste?

40:19.150 --> 40:21.051
How the (bleep)
do I taste, bitch?

40:21.118 --> 40:23.521
{\an1}Big fat rotten
(bleep) teeth, too, bitch!

40:23.587 --> 40:25.189
{\an1}Get the (bleep)
out of here.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.763
{\an8}Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

40:32.830 --> 40:35.132
{\an8}You try me,
you try my happiness,

40:35.199 --> 40:38.135
{\an8}I'm-a (bleep) you up.

40:38.202 --> 40:39.737
{\an8}I had a conversation
with Miles.

40:39.804 --> 40:41.238
{\an8}I'm ready to move forward.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.274
{\an7}Now you all of a sudden
have all these reservations.

40:43.340 --> 40:44.508
{\an7}And where's that
coming from?

40:44.575 --> 40:46.877
{\an8}I feel like he might
be cheating.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.312
{\an8}Now you trying to flip it
like it's a cheat thing?

40:48.379 --> 40:49.547
{\an8}Nobody's trying
to flip (bleep).

40:49.613 --> 40:50.548
{\an8}I can't-- I'm not doing
this (bleep).

40:50.614 --> 40:52.583
{\an8}(glass shatters)

40:50.614 --> 40:52.583
{\an8}I'm going home.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.984
{\an8}I like Mya,
you know what I mean?

40:54.051 --> 40:55.319
{\an8}She's really cool,
really sweet.

40:55.386 --> 40:57.421
{\an7}You've been to a restaurant,
you get those, like,

40:57.488 --> 40:58.889
{\an7}that one appetizer
you like,

40:58.956 --> 41:00.724
{\an7}and then you got like
a main course that you stay to?

41:00.791 --> 41:01.992
{\an8}You're referring to me
as an appetizer?

41:02.059 --> 41:03.360
{\an8}No, I'm saying
I'm sampling.

41:03.427 --> 41:04.361
{\an8}What are you doing?

41:04.428 --> 41:05.930
{\an7}Are you ready
to hit the stu?

41:05.996 --> 41:08.599
{\an8}Which means probably
gonna be girls around.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.202
{\an7}Bitch, get your mother(bleep)
arms off my husband.

41:11.268 --> 41:13.938
{\an7}All I know is nobody's gettin'
out the mother(bleep) room!

41:14.004 --> 41:15.706
{\an8}That's what I do know!
