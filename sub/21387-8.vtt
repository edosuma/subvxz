10:21.812 --> 10:23.478

- Ooh, go.

10:23.478 --> 10:26.770
- So fast.
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.770 --> 10:28.645
Did you even know Kelli
was training for this?

10:28.645 --> 10:30.103
Fuck, no. How?

10:30.103 --> 10:31.729
'Cause she started
taking her pulse?

10:31.729 --> 10:33.311
I mean, she did get
a Fitbit.

10:33.311 --> 10:34.937
- Ugh.
- And she does
look taller.

10:34.937 --> 10:36.145
Girl, she invited me
to come

10:36.145 --> 10:37.770
to some jazz class
with her a month ago.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.311
- I was like,
"Bitch, why?"
- ( chuckles )

10:40.311 --> 10:42.854
- We are wack friends.
- Tsk.

10:42.854 --> 10:44.395
Where's she
supposed to be?

10:44.395 --> 10:45.895
I don't know.
She said we can't
miss her.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.145
She got on
all white.

10:47.145 --> 10:48.687
Hey, have you been
to EightyTwo?

10:48.687 --> 10:49.937
- The arcade bar?
- Mm-hmm.

10:49.937 --> 10:51.520
I thought you quit
playing games.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.437
( laughs )

10:53.437 --> 10:56.103
( mock laughing )

10:56.103 --> 10:57.895
That's how I laugh.

10:57.895 --> 11:00.103
Quentin's coming to L.A.
in two weeks.

11:00.103 --> 11:03.186
- Ooh, you should
take him to Earle's Grill.
- Nah, girl, they closed.

11:03.186 --> 11:05.520
Nah, girl,
they opened back up
with the Metro line.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.895
Oh, maybe we should
go there,

11:06.895 --> 11:08.270
'cause I'm trying
to keep it real casual.

11:08.270 --> 11:11.020
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

11:11.020 --> 11:14.395
I like him,
but he's not my type.

11:14.395 --> 11:16.270
Pic, please.

11:16.270 --> 11:17.687
Molly:
Ugh!

11:17.687 --> 11:19.186
Oh, he got a beard.

11:19.186 --> 11:21.145
- That's what's up.
- Mm-hmm.

11:21.145 --> 11:23.020
Sorry.
We're late.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.687
There's
a good reason why.

11:24.687 --> 11:27.645
- ( phone buzzes )
- Oh, we just got a text
from Kelli.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.895
"Meet me at
the finish line"?

11:29.895 --> 11:30.979
Damn, already?

11:30.979 --> 11:32.645
That bitch got
Kenyan in her?

11:32.645 --> 11:36.478
I see you accepted
a structured settlement
on your last case.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.937
- Yes, I always put
my client's interest first.
- Mm-hmm.

11:39.937 --> 11:43.020
What would you do
if your client didn't
want the annuity

11:43.020 --> 11:44.979
and wanted
a lump sum settlement?

11:44.979 --> 11:47.770
You know,
I actually had
that exact scenario happen

11:47.770 --> 11:49.353
when I was
a second-year associate.

11:49.353 --> 11:51.687
I present both options
to my clients when necessary,

11:51.687 --> 11:53.353
but I determine
my recommendation

11:53.353 --> 11:55.103
based on
the settlement amount.

11:55.103 --> 11:58.228
It's all about
helping the client make
an educated decision.

11:58.228 --> 12:00.061
Honestly, Molly,

12:00.061 --> 12:01.812
you know,
you were great
on paper,

12:01.812 --> 12:05.145
but now that
we've met you,
we're impressed.

12:05.145 --> 12:07.478
- ( chuckles )
- And I love that
you're an L.A. native.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.770
- Florence and Crenshaw.
- My dad grew up there.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.437
Is the McDonald's
still on the corner?

12:11.437 --> 12:13.687
- Sure is.
- ( all laughing )

12:13.687 --> 12:16.437
- Quentin:
So, Hayward made the offer?
- I got it three days ago.

12:16.437 --> 12:18.895
So, what I'm gonna do
is just go on a couple more
interviews,

12:18.895 --> 12:21.937
- take a few more offers...
- Yeah, and bring it to
the partners, right?

12:21.937 --> 12:24.103
- Okay. Okay,
Molly, I see you.
- ( chuckles )

12:24.103 --> 12:25.979
Now let them know
you can go anyplace
you want to.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.061
Exactly,
and hopefully,
they'll wake up

12:28.061 --> 12:29.937
and bring something
to the table.

12:29.937 --> 12:31.478
That's right,
how it goes is
up to them.

12:31.478 --> 12:33.145
Yeah, what it's really up to
is that paper.

12:33.145 --> 12:35.478
That's real, you know?
Just cut the check.

12:35.478 --> 12:38.061
- Merrill,
cut the check.
- ( both chuckling )

12:38.061 --> 12:39.770
And, uh, can you
count them zeros?

12:39.770 --> 12:41.603
Future Molly
trying to fuck up
some commas!

12:41.603 --> 12:44.520
- Oh, hey!
- I'm sorry,
did you want the check?

12:44.520 --> 12:46.520
Wait, what?
Nah, nah, we don't.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.270
We good.
We ain't ordered yet.

12:48.270 --> 12:49.270
I'm sorry.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.979
I mean...

12:51.979 --> 12:54.520
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.603
I-- I saw a guy
I used to know.

12:56.603 --> 12:59.311
I mean, look,
of course guys out here
check you out.

12:59.311 --> 13:00.979
You're the most
beautiful woman in here.

13:00.979 --> 13:02.812
Tsk, okay, Quentin.

13:02.812 --> 13:04.395
No, I'm serious.

13:04.395 --> 13:06.186
And, like, thanks for
taking me out, you know?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.395
And when you're
in Chicago next week,

13:08.395 --> 13:10.895
um, you know, take
one of those nights off

13:10.895 --> 13:12.145
and we'll do dinner.

13:13.645 --> 13:16.437
I guess.
I gotta eat.
( chuckles )

13:16.437 --> 13:18.937
I'm always
down to eat, homie.

13:21.145 --> 13:24.478
Dr. Pine:
Well, "homie" is not
a great place to start.

13:24.478 --> 13:26.937
Why do you just
see him as a friend?

13:26.937 --> 13:30.020
He just doesn't seem like
the guy I should be with.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.437
Ugh, "should."
I know. I heard it.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.645
Well, maybe
it's time to focus on
what you could have instead.

13:35.645 --> 13:37.645
Get out of the should
and live in the could.

13:38.895 --> 13:41.270
I promise I've never
said that before.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.937
- ( both chuckling )
- But we're just gonna
go with it.

13:43.937 --> 13:46.687
I could get with it.

13:46.687 --> 13:48.729
I'm glad
you're back, Molly.

13:48.729 --> 13:50.854
So let's schedule
your next appointment.

13:50.854 --> 13:52.061
- Oh...
- Yeah.

13:59.478 --> 14:01.061
We missed our chance
for the 12th,

14:01.061 --> 14:03.603
but if we file by tomorrow,
we can still meet
the deadline

14:03.603 --> 14:06.520
to oppose the motion
for summary judgment.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.186
- You know what?
- Hmm?

14:08.186 --> 14:09.729
We deserve
some incentive.

14:09.729 --> 14:11.520
What?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.812
Oh, where were you
when I didn't wanna

14:13.812 --> 14:16.020
study for the LSATs?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.562
Yes!

14:17.562 --> 14:19.228
Hey, you can take us
out the 'hood...

14:19.228 --> 14:20.353
( both chuckling )

14:20.353 --> 14:22.103
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

14:22.103 --> 14:25.729
Keep going, keep--
oh, okay, okay, we good.

14:25.729 --> 14:27.353
Ah, we deserve this.

14:27.353 --> 14:29.937
To working hard
and getting it done.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.603
- ( chuckling )
- Bam!

14:33.562 --> 14:35.520
- Ah, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.145
So, is everybody
in the Carter family
as successful as you?

14:38.145 --> 14:41.979
Well, my younger brother
is 26 and still doesn't have
a driver's license.

14:41.979 --> 14:44.228
My older brother's
married to a stripper.

14:44.228 --> 14:45.812
- What about you?
- ( chuckles )

14:45.812 --> 14:48.729
My sister sells
flat tummy tea
on Instagram.

14:48.729 --> 14:50.395
- Hmm.
- I mean, she got
hella followers,

14:50.395 --> 14:52.437
- but what's her endgame?
- Wait, what's her name?

14:52.437 --> 14:54.729
I might follow her.

14:54.729 --> 14:57.520
( sighs )
You know, this might be
the best time I've had

14:57.520 --> 14:58.854
working late
in this office.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.603
- Really?
- Yeah.

- You never know.
- Issa: From what you said,

15:53.812 --> 15:56.311
it sounds like you know
the dick was meh.

15:56.311 --> 15:58.145
Okay, wait,
I never said that.

15:58.145 --> 16:01.311
I like him.
And, plus, he's been
hella supportive

16:01.311 --> 16:03.228
throughout this whole
job interview thing.

16:03.228 --> 16:07.061
And he makes me laugh,
which, right now,
is kind of nice.

16:07.061 --> 16:09.979
Okay. So, have you decided
what you're gonna do
about work?

16:09.979 --> 16:11.895
You gonna
stay with the whites
or go with the blacks?

16:11.895 --> 16:15.186
I don't know.
I mean, at least at MJ&S
I know what I'm getting.

16:15.186 --> 16:17.770
Plus, I put in
a lot of time there already.

16:17.770 --> 16:20.353
But then at Hayward,
I feel like they get me.

16:20.353 --> 16:22.645
But then again, how much
can you really tell
from one interview?

16:22.645 --> 16:25.353
I just wanna go with
whoever values me the most.

16:25.353 --> 16:26.937
Blacks all "zay."

16:26.937 --> 16:28.520
- ( Molly chuckles )
- Hold up, Ida B. Wells.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.854
You know when
you work with black folks,
they get too comfortable.

16:30.854 --> 16:32.353
They wanna compare
potato salad.

16:32.353 --> 16:33.687
They get all up
in your business,

16:33.687 --> 16:34.687
trying to add you
on Facebook,

16:34.687 --> 16:35.687
inviting you
to church!

16:35.687 --> 16:36.937
It's like,
"Damn, Therese!

16:36.937 --> 16:39.061
Quit trying to
baptize me at work."

16:39.061 --> 16:41.395
- Wow.
- Damn,

16:41.395 --> 16:44.145
maybe working
with whites is right.

16:44.145 --> 16:46.520
On the other hand,
when you working
with white folks,

16:46.520 --> 16:49.603
you gotta make them
feel comfortable about you.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.895
Explaining
your outfits,

16:51.895 --> 16:53.353
speaking on behalf
of all black people,

16:53.353 --> 16:54.562
trying not to be
a stereotype.

16:54.562 --> 16:56.145
It's like,
"Okay, Meg,

16:56.145 --> 16:57.854
I'm eating watermelon.
So what, bitch?

16:57.854 --> 16:59.353
It's hot."

16:59.353 --> 17:01.562
- ( phone buzzing )
- So, I'm just fucked.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.812
- Apparently.
- Ugh, it's Tiff.
She can't make it.

17:04.812 --> 17:07.437
- I'll call her.
- Boo!

17:07.437 --> 17:10.812
You know what, you could
be a lawyer anywhere.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.645
- Follow the money.
- That's what Quentin said.

17:13.645 --> 17:16.228
- ( music playing on TV )
- Oh, shit, Kelli,
it's starting!

17:16.228 --> 17:18.812
Kelli:
Mm, here we go.
"Due North"!

17:18.812 --> 17:21.729
For starters,
we know that you've been
meeting with other firms.

17:21.729 --> 17:23.854
The legal community
in L.A. is very small.

17:23.854 --> 17:25.437
Merrill:
Bottom line, Molly,
we wanna make sure

17:25.437 --> 17:27.603
that you know
we hear you and value you.

17:27.603 --> 17:29.937
And, uh, we don't
wanna lose you.

17:29.937 --> 17:32.770
Well, thank you.
That means a lot
to hear you say that.

17:32.770 --> 17:35.270
Which is why
we are giving you...

17:36.478 --> 17:38.854
the Rising Star Award!

17:38.854 --> 17:41.270
- ( Merrill chuckles )
- Schwartz: It acknowledges
new talent

17:41.270 --> 17:43.437
poised to go very far
in the legal field.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.520
Johnson:
Your photo will be
prominently featured

17:45.520 --> 17:47.645
on the firm's website.

17:47.645 --> 17:49.145
Molly:
For real?

17:49.145 --> 17:51.478
- You play too much.
- ( phone buzzing )

17:51.478 --> 17:53.562
( shower running )

17:55.979 --> 17:56.937
Hey.

17:58.437 --> 17:59.937
Oh, shit,
what happened?

17:59.937 --> 18:01.603
- ( air horn blaring )
- ( crowd cheering )

18:01.603 --> 18:03.729

18:13.228 --> 18:15.687
Where is she?
These people smell so bad.

18:15.687 --> 18:18.228
- My nose is so sensitive.
- Oh, is that her?

18:20.228 --> 18:22.186
- ( Issa scoffs )
- Kelli!

18:22.186 --> 18:24.103
- Hey, guys.
- What happened?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.979
I'm so sorry.
I-- I got my period.

18:26.979 --> 18:28.603
- No!
- That makes one of us.

18:28.603 --> 18:30.437
- Gross.
- But why didn't you just

18:30.437 --> 18:32.311
put in a tampon
and keep moving?

18:32.311 --> 18:33.937
Well, it got me
before I could get it.

18:33.937 --> 18:35.520
I mean,
I got to mile nine

18:35.520 --> 18:36.812
and the Red Wedding hit.

18:36.812 --> 18:39.478
Just killed my drawers.
Just dead.

18:39.478 --> 18:42.145
Then I got bussed
to the finish line
over an hour ago.

18:42.145 --> 18:44.770
( snorting )

18:44.770 --> 18:47.478
No, I'm sorry.
That's-- oh, no, yeah.

18:47.478 --> 18:49.854
Well, honey, at least
your Ivy Park is on point.

18:49.854 --> 18:51.603
I know, right?

18:51.603 --> 18:53.729
But I didn't
finish my shit!

18:53.729 --> 18:56.103
I mean, y'all know
I've been training
for months.

18:56.103 --> 18:57.770
- Both: Yeah, we knew that.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.478
Well, look how far you got.
I mean, you ran nine miles.

19:00.478 --> 19:03.395
- None of us can run that.
- I mean, it's basically
just a 10K.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.687
Honey, can we let
Auntie Kelli have this

19:05.687 --> 19:07.854
for our
little angel?

19:07.854 --> 19:09.979
Aw, Baby DuBois!

19:09.979 --> 19:12.353
Wait, you knew
Tiffany was pregnant?

19:12.353 --> 19:14.186
Yeah, sorry.
We're closer.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.770
Sorry. I mean, y'all can
plan the baby shower
with my suggestions.

19:17.770 --> 19:21.311
We stopped trying,
but then we were so high
at Issa's party...

19:21.311 --> 19:24.687
Whoo-hoo, that's our
little weed baby in there.

19:24.687 --> 19:27.186
( Kelli laughing )

19:27.186 --> 19:30.103
- Y'all cute!
Y'all cute.
- Yeah!

19:30.103 --> 19:32.020
Kelli:
I can't believe
you're having a baby.

19:32.020 --> 19:34.270
Ugh, good things happening
to good people.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.979
Tiffany:
We're all doing
great things.

19:35.979 --> 19:38.020
Look at you getting fit.
Look at Kelli.

19:38.020 --> 19:40.979
Look at Molly
taking interviews,
taking names.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.687
Look at Issa.

19:42.687 --> 19:44.770
- Mmm.
- Kelli: Look at--

19:44.770 --> 19:45.979
no, you told me
before.

19:45.979 --> 19:47.520
- Yeah, no, she--
- Kelli: Yeah.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.311
Almost there.
Tip of the tongue.

19:49.311 --> 19:51.186
- Drop it.
( imitates bomb dropping )
- Issa.

19:51.186 --> 19:53.895
- Kelli: Ah! ( chuckles )
- Tiffany: Issa...

19:53.895 --> 19:56.729
- I'm, uh, moving.
- Shit.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.061
Yeah.

19:59.895 --> 20:02.228
Joanne:
I am so moved.

20:02.228 --> 20:03.895
The mountain
came to Muhammed.

20:05.228 --> 20:07.103
Are we the mountain?

20:07.103 --> 20:10.478
Isn't that
the question?

20:10.478 --> 20:12.603
Frieda:
Wite-Out? Wite-Out?

20:12.603 --> 20:15.270
Ah, para tu,
para tu, aqui.

20:15.270 --> 20:18.353
What got you guys thinking
about using the space
on weekends?

20:18.353 --> 20:20.812
We just, uh, wanted
to service the students

20:20.812 --> 20:22.562
that weren't being
serviced during the week.

20:22.562 --> 20:25.687
What do you mean?
Why weren't kids
being serviced?

20:25.687 --> 20:28.395
Oh, just the program
got really popular.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.937
Well, we could've had
Kitty and Sarah back in
if it was a space issue.

20:31.937 --> 20:34.812
Uh, it was
more than that.

20:34.812 --> 20:37.228
The vice principal was
just being really resistant.

20:37.228 --> 20:39.603
How so?
I didn't see any
of this in the reports.

20:39.603 --> 20:40.937
Let me get Frieda
over here.

20:40.937 --> 20:42.937
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't need to
involve her.

20:44.395 --> 20:46.937
This is
entirely on me.

20:46.937 --> 20:50.979
The VP wasn't interested
in servicing Latino students.

20:50.979 --> 20:54.270
We-- I thought
we could remedy that

20:54.270 --> 20:55.770
by having
extra sessions here.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.520
Wait, wait, wait.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.145
Are-- are you
telling me

20:59.145 --> 21:02.186
that you're having segregated
We Got Y'all sessions here?

21:02.186 --> 21:04.937
Do you know
what this could--
this could be a lawsuit.

21:04.937 --> 21:09.020
- I didn't think about that.
- This is incredibly
disappointing.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.895
I'm so sorry.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.145
After we make some calls
to remedy this,

21:13.145 --> 21:16.020
we need to reevaluate
having you out
in the field.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.687
Kelli:
Why are you just
standing there?!

21:24.687 --> 21:28.729
- Run!
- Isaac done
killed Christine

21:28.729 --> 21:33.061
- 'cause she was having
relations with Ms. Lydia.
- ( coughs )

21:33.061 --> 21:35.437
- Damn!
- What the fuck?

21:35.437 --> 21:37.478
When Ninny told me
the poison didn't work,

21:37.478 --> 21:39.145
I did what I had to do!

21:39.145 --> 21:41.186
- ( grunting )
- Get off!

21:41.186 --> 21:43.145
I hate slavery!

21:43.145 --> 21:46.478
- You sick, lying...
- ( both arguing )

21:49.353 --> 21:51.603
I thought
that simple slave
was really simple.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.061
And I told you
that fool was shifty.

21:53.061 --> 21:57.061
You see, you mind
your business,
you get free.

21:57.061 --> 21:59.937
- ( Molly scoffs )
- ( phones buzzing )

21:59.937 --> 22:03.103
- Pssh.
- It's Tiffany's pregnant ass
trying to get all in the mix.

22:03.103 --> 22:06.687
She just got pregnant
and she's already being
boring and dramatic.

22:06.687 --> 22:08.478
( mocking )
"I'm Tiffany.
I'm pregnant."

22:08.478 --> 22:09.729
( scoffs )
Calm down.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.687
You know she gonna
eat the placenta?

22:11.687 --> 22:13.353
That bitch
gonna live forever.

22:13.353 --> 22:15.770
Mmm.

22:15.770 --> 22:19.020
So, now that
"Due North" is over,
y'all wanna help me pack?

22:19.020 --> 22:20.895
For what?
You ain't got
nowhere to go.

22:20.895 --> 22:22.937
- I still gotta leave!
- We'll help you.

22:22.937 --> 22:24.353
- Come on, girl.
- Pssh.

22:24.353 --> 22:26.353
Thank you.
You can help me
wrap up my valuables.

22:26.353 --> 22:28.603
Girl, stop playing
and tell us what you
really want us to do.

22:28.603 --> 22:30.228
- ( chuckles )
- Both: "Valuables."

22:30.228 --> 22:33.353
Just wrap
my shit up, please.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.770
Have you contacted my friend,
Kaliah, about being
your roommate?

22:35.770 --> 22:37.186
Nah, not yet.

22:37.186 --> 22:38.603
Honestly, I wanna
live by myself.

22:38.603 --> 22:41.145
Bitch, where?!
You ain't got no money!

22:41.145 --> 22:44.478
I didn't mean
to come at you like that,
but a bitch try a bitch.

22:44.478 --> 22:48.228
Okay, Issa,
Kelli's got a point.

22:48.228 --> 22:50.437
Kelli:
You can't live anywhere
but way the fuck out.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.770
I'm talking Lancaster,
West Covina.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.812
I can afford
to live alone,

22:54.812 --> 22:57.812
you know, if I take
a second job or something.

22:57.812 --> 23:01.020
Well, maybe you can sell
some of your stuff.

23:01.020 --> 23:03.687
I guess I could
get rid of some things.

23:03.687 --> 23:05.562
Just everything.

23:10.854 --> 23:12.520
It is with great pleasure
that I introduce you

23:12.520 --> 23:16.270
to our new director
of student outreach.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.228
Frieda.

23:23.437 --> 23:25.103
Hey, wait,
she got promoted?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.854
Yes, I need
to feel confident
about who I have in charge.

23:27.854 --> 23:29.895
Frieda has spearheaded
several initiatives here.

23:29.895 --> 23:32.937
- She's more than capable.
- ( whispers ) I'm more
more than capable.

23:32.937 --> 23:35.103
- ( whispers ) I so agree.
- Thank you, Joanne.

23:35.103 --> 23:36.562
No, thank you.

23:40.228 --> 23:42.395
- Is Ken about to cry?
- I don't know.

23:42.395 --> 23:44.937
- I'm here
if you wanna talk.
- I'm fine.

23:46.603 --> 23:47.937
Hey, Frieda.

23:47.937 --> 23:50.770
I'm--
I'm so happy for you.

23:50.770 --> 23:53.478
You deserve this
more than anyone here.

23:53.478 --> 23:56.020
Thank you, Issa.
That... ( inhales )

23:56.020 --> 23:57.603
that means a lot.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.186
Well, can I buy you
a drink?

24:00.186 --> 24:01.603
Yeah,
I'd like that.

24:01.603 --> 24:04.603
Cool.
( sighs )

24:06.186 --> 24:07.645
I meant,
like, now.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.854
Oh, yes,
that'd be great!

24:09.854 --> 24:12.270
Oh, we should we go
somewhere in I'wood.

24:12.270 --> 24:13.311
No.

24:13.311 --> 24:15.562

call it that again.

Everyone knows this is
a buyer-beware situation.

24:23.687 --> 24:25.979
You really think
you're gonna get $8
for this blanket?

24:25.979 --> 24:28.145
- It's from Crate & Barrel.
- It's from Target and it
has mustard on it.

24:28.145 --> 24:30.228
- You need to lower your prices.
- And you need to lower
your voice

24:30.228 --> 24:32.103

is garnering interest.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.270

because none of this shit
is coming back to my spot.

24:38.228 --> 24:40.854

24:40.854 --> 24:45.353
- "Bauliflower" soup.

- And it's $10.
- I'll give you $5
and this EBT "bard."

24:48.520 --> 24:49.854

24:54.937 --> 24:57.145

You said five.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.270
Oh, my God,
please don't apologize.

30:24.270 --> 30:27.270
Just give me a second.
Let me finish, please.

30:27.270 --> 30:31.437
I've been thinking
about how

30:31.437 --> 30:37.437
sometimes I set
these expectations
for myself,

30:37.437 --> 30:42.812
and I just--
I shut down

30:42.812 --> 30:46.103
if they don't go
how I...

30:46.103 --> 30:47.812
I just, uh...

30:50.687 --> 30:54.854
I'm sorry
for not being who
you expected me to be.

30:57.145 --> 31:00.770
Who I expected me
to be.

31:08.061 --> 31:12.103
Lawrence, I wanted
to be better for you.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.729
Because of you.

31:15.562 --> 31:18.562
But somewhere
along the way,

31:18.562 --> 31:23.103
I depended on you
to be better for both of us.

31:23.103 --> 31:26.103
And when you
were going through

31:26.103 --> 31:28.061
what you were
going through,

31:28.061 --> 31:30.103
I just didn't know
how to handle it.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.061
I mean, what could
you have done, though?

31:32.061 --> 31:32.937
More.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.061
You know, that's
when you needed me

31:36.061 --> 31:39.186
to be better
for the both of us,

31:39.186 --> 31:44.437
and I didn't even know
how to do that for myself.

31:44.437 --> 31:46.562
Well, that makes
two of us.

31:53.353 --> 31:55.687
And, you know,

31:55.687 --> 31:57.895
- what I did...
- We don't have to
go through that.

31:57.895 --> 32:02.103
...it was the worst thing
I could've ever
done to you.

32:06.186 --> 32:10.270
And I wish I could
somehow convince you
that it wasn't about you.

32:14.895 --> 32:17.437
You've only ever
loved me

32:17.437 --> 32:20.478
and expected me
to want the best for you,

32:20.478 --> 32:23.228
and I promise I did.

32:23.228 --> 32:24.603
I still do.

32:28.854 --> 32:30.020
( sniffles )

32:37.270 --> 32:40.311
Lawrence, I still
love you so much.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.437
I love you, too.

32:55.687 --> 32:56.979
( sniffles )

33:00.478 --> 33:02.854
( exhales )

33:10.979 --> 33:15.520
Uh, so, I'm gonna
head out.

33:17.353 --> 33:18.687
Okay.

33:40.687 --> 33:41.854
Bye, Iss.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.562
- Issa...
- Oh, my...

33:50.562 --> 33:52.979
...I can't imagine
my life without you,

33:52.979 --> 33:55.729
and I don't ever
wanna lose you.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.311
Will you marry me?

33:57.311 --> 34:00.228
Oh, my God.

34:00.228 --> 34:01.729
- Yes.
