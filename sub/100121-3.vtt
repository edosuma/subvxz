00:01.305 --> 00:03.133
MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

00:03.177 --> 00:05.570
FOR 7 YEARS, I HAVE FOUGHT
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL--

00:05.614 --> 00:07.181
TO SAVE MY CITY,

00:07.224 --> 00:08.747
BUT NOW A NEW THREAT
HAS EMERGED,

00:08.791 --> 00:10.227
A DANGER SO SEVERE,
IT HAS FORCED ME

00:10.271 --> 00:12.186
TO LEAVE MY FAMILY
IN ORDER TO FACE IT,

00:12.229 --> 00:14.840
AND IT WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR ME
TO JUST BE THE GREEN ARROW.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.407
TO PREVENT THE CRISIS
THAT'S COMING,

00:16.451 --> 00:18.627
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME
SOMEONE ELSE.

00:18.670 --> 00:21.021
I AM GOING TO HAVE
TO BECOME...SOMETHING ELSE.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.896
AS WELL AS HE THINKS.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.158
WE'RE ALL STILL
ALIVE, AREN'T WE?

00:28.202 --> 00:29.638
WHICH MEANS WHAT EXACTLY,

00:29.681 --> 00:31.074
THAT YOUR BROTHER'S NOT
SUCH A BAD GUY?

00:31.118 --> 00:32.162
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.468
JJ: YOU ARE NOT
GONNA TOUCH ME.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.035
OH, MY GOD.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.558
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,

00:36.601 --> 00:37.907
THE MEN WHO ARE
STORMING YOUR BUNKER
RIGHT NOW

00:37.950 --> 00:39.387
WILL KILL YOUR BROTHER.

OLIVER: I IGNORED THE ORDERS
OF A COSMIC BEING,

00:40.953 --> 00:42.172
AND AS A RESULT,
I WATCHED

00:42.216 --> 00:44.305
AN ENTIRE WORLD
DISAPPEAR.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.133

THE DESTRUCTION
OF EVERYTHING?

00:46.176 --> 00:47.612
THAT'S THE VERY
DEFINITION OF ALL
HANDS ON DECK.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.223
A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE DIED ALREADY

00:49.266 --> 00:50.659
FOR THE SAKE
OF THIS MISSION.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.182
I OWE IT TO ALL OF THEM
TO FIND OUT WHO

00:52.226 --> 00:53.444
THE MONITOR REALLY IS.

00:53.488 --> 00:54.489
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

00:54.532 --> 00:55.881
I'M GOING TO NANDA PARBAT.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.845

MIA'S FOR MOM

01:46.889 --> 01:49.631
AND NOT MY CORTO MALTESE

01:53.765 --> 01:55.506
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, OLLIE.

WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.731

02:02.774 --> 02:04.515
I WASN'T EXPECTING TO
FIND YOU HERE ALONE.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.517
WHERE'S NYSSA?

02:06.561 --> 02:09.390
THAILAND, I THINK.
I DON'T KNOW.

02:09.433 --> 02:12.262
AFTER WE DESTROYED
THE LAZARUS PITS,

02:12.306 --> 02:15.526
SHE SAID SHE HAD SOME
LEAGUE BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF.

02:15.570 --> 02:18.573
YOU DESTROYED
THE PITS.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.227
WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME HOME?

02:20.270 --> 02:24.666
PITS MAY BE GONE,
BUT THE THANATOS GUILD ISN'T.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.495
I HAVE TO TAKE THEM DOWN
AFTER WHAT THEY DID TO ROY.

02:27.538 --> 02:30.106
THAT'S FAIR.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.109
HE CAME BACK HERE
AFTER STAR CITY.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.155
HE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED,

02:35.198 --> 02:38.723
HOW HE KILLED
THOSE MEN AND...

02:38.767 --> 02:41.552
HE'S DEALING
WITH HIS OWN DEMONS.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.163
HE'LL BE BACK.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.426
[SIGHS]

02:45.469 --> 02:47.297
I MISSED YOU.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.386
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.389
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M NOT THE REASON
WHY YOU CAME HERE.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.391
LAST YEAR, I MADE
A DEAL

02:54.435 --> 02:57.786
WITH A COSMIC BEING
NAMED MAR NOVU.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.223
RECENTLY, HE CAME
TO COLLECT HIS DEBT.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
HE ASKED ME TO
HELP HIM,

03:02.269 --> 03:06.055
BUT HE'S NOT VERY GOOD
AT SHARING INFORMATION

03:06.098 --> 03:08.318
WITH THE PEOPLE
HE'S WORKING WITH.

03:08.362 --> 03:12.931
SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE I KNOW.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.412
I NEED TO BE 100% SURE
THAT I CAN TRUST HIM.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.588
I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT I WAS HOPING

03:17.632 --> 03:21.549
THAT NYSSA COULD TELL ME
WHAT, IF ANYTHING,

03:21.592 --> 03:23.507
THE LEAGUE KNOWS
ABOUT HIM.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.380
OK. WHAT ARE YOU
NOT TELLING ME?

03:26.423 --> 03:27.642
HE'S SEEN THE FUTURE.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.560

03:36.346 --> 03:38.218
IT'S SOON, SPEEDY.

AS YOU NEED TO BE UPSET.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.839
OLLIE, COME ON.
YOU'VE CHEATED DEATH

03:50.882 --> 03:53.668
MORE THAN ANY OF US
HAVE BY THIS POINT.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.452
THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING

03:55.496 --> 03:57.411
THAT WE'VE EVER DEALT
WITH BEFORE.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.763
OK.

04:01.806 --> 04:06.071
WELL, LET'S TRY TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH,

04:06.115 --> 04:08.857
BUT LIKE I SAID,
NYSSA'S NOT HERE.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.642
SARA HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO HELP EITHER.

04:11.686 --> 04:15.429
WE'VE KIND OF KILLED OFF
EVERY LEAGUE MEMBER,

OF ONE MORE.

THROUGH THE FLOOR.

OF THEIR LIVES.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.116
THIS IS WHY JJ WAS
GOING AFTER WILLIAM.

STILL ALIVE ANYWAY.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.515

ASSAULT.

04:58.559 --> 05:01.518
THERE'S 10
CONFIRMED DEAD.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.738

WHO THEY ALL ARE,

05:03.781 --> 05:06.741
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE HE WIPES OUT
THE ENTIRE MOVEMENT.

05:06.784 --> 05:10.135

WE TRAP HIM FIRST.

IS THE RIGHT...LURE.

YOURSELF AS BAIT?

YOU DON'T WANT TO
HEAR THIS,

GOING TO BRING

DICTATE OUR STRATEGY.

I WISH WE WERE STILL
ON THAT TOUR.

WE'RE LOOKING FOR?

13:35.684 --> 13:37.860
BECAUSE THE THIEVES
DID NOT CONSIDER IT
TO BE OF VALUE.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.470

13:49.089 --> 13:53.049
YES, BUT WHAT DOES
IT MEAN?

13:53.093 --> 13:56.792
TO JOIN THE LEAGUE,
YOUR OLD SELF MUST DIE

13:56.836 --> 13:58.881
SO THAT YOUR NEW ONE
MAY BE REBORN.

OH.

TO HIDE HIS SECRETS

14:20.163 --> 14:21.469
LEST HE BE BETRAYED.

14:24.211 --> 14:27.127
I BELIEVE THIS LEADS
TO AL-FATIH'S TOMB.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.737
IT STANDS TO REASON
THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT

14:28.780 --> 14:30.652
TO TAKE HIS SECRETS
WITH HIM BEYOND THE GRAVE.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.088
SO IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.524

WHY CAN'T EVERYTHING
JUST BE EASY?

SITUATION IS MORE
DIFFICULT THAN YOU THINK.

-ATHENA.
-YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

RIGHT WHEN WE DID
CAN'T BE AN ACCIDENT.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.473
IF YOU'RE ACCUSING

POINT OUT TWO THINGS.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.910
FIRST, ATHENA AND I
ARE BLOOD ENEMIES.

TRAILING YOU.

ON HER.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.223

WHY ATHENA WOULD GIVE

16:03.266 --> 16:05.703
A CRAP ABOUT A RUSTY,
OLD SCROLL BURIED
WITH AL-FATIH.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.054

A CRAP

ABOUT WHAT ELSE

16:09.533 --> 16:11.100

AS THE RING OF RA'S.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.548
THE MARKINGS ON IT
WERE CONSTELLATIONS

16:24.592 --> 16:26.942

THE TOMB'S LOCATION,
BUT WE DON'T NEED IT.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.075

FOR US THERE.

A MOMENT.

-EXIFL THEM.
-IT WOULD TAKE A TEAM

AT LEAST AN HOUR
TO GET HERE.

A LOT CAN HAPPEN
BETWEEN NOW THAT THEN.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.331
OK, FINE, BUT WE
CAN'T RISK DOING
THIS ALONE.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.420
-WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
-THEN YOU LEAVE.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.378

AND CONNOR MYSELF.

I'D NEVER SEEN A WORLD
JUST DISINTEGRATE
IN FRONT OF MY FACE.

18:14.267 --> 18:17.835
I KNOW WHAT WE DO
REQUIRES RISK.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.228
I'VE ALWAYS
ACCEPTED THAT,

18:19.272 --> 18:23.145
BUT THIS IS
DIFFERENT, LYLA.

JUST DISAPPEARING,

18:28.890 --> 18:32.067
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S
LIKE--

18:32.111 --> 18:36.376
LIKE LOOKING
INTO THE EYE OF GOD.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.247

18:38.291 --> 18:39.944

ALL WE CAN DO IS
ENJOY THE TIME WE HAVE

18:56.918 --> 18:59.660
WITH THE PEOPLE WE LOVE
AND MAKE OUR CHOICES

18:59.703 --> 19:04.230
FROM A PLACE OF STRENGTH,
NOT FEAR,

19:04.273 --> 19:06.362
AND IF THE WORLD
ENDS TODAY,

19:06.406 --> 19:09.104
THERE IS NO ONE I'D
RATHER HAVE BY MY SIDE.

WANT HER TO BE OR NOT?

RIGHT THERE.

GET TO THE SWORD,

20:44.199 --> 20:45.722
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU
GET IT EITHER.

ONE EVIL COMPANION.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.263

I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO
STAY AT THE CAMP.

21:13.228 --> 21:16.362
YOU DID. LOOKS LIKE
I DIDN'T IGNORE YOU
SOON ENOUGH.

FOR AN I TOLD YOU SO.

OF THE MOUNTAIN IS FASTER.
