WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.405
Joe Gallo's actions
led to our last war.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.108
My family is now
the Colombo family,

00:07.208 --> 00:09.310
and I have a right to handle
these matters as I see fit.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.744
What do you got in mind
for him?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.780
I'm gonna light his whole
fucking world on fire

00:12.880 --> 00:14.615
and burn everything
he ever loved

00:14.715 --> 00:16.016
to the fucking ground.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.051
I'm a serious man,
and I'm committed

00:17.151 --> 00:18.352
to making a serious movie,

00:18.452 --> 00:20.488
one that family men
like yourself can be proud of.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.556
If you want me to change the
script, I'll change the script.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.392
I know who Michael is.
Who?

00:24.492 --> 00:26.594
Al Pacino.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
That shrimp never
gets the part.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.098
He's a beautiful actor!

00:30.198 --> 00:31.765
Hey, director,
take a visual cue.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.401
Doesn't get this part.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.802
These scripts,
they come into your office

00:34.902 --> 00:36.070
and just sit there.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.037
That's just money burning.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.673
So let me help you.
We can do this together.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.708
If that's what you want.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.810
Hi, Bob.
Hey, gorgeous.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.113
I will find me a producer

00:45.213 --> 00:47.748
who knows not to shit
where he sleeps.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.551
Mr. Lovano, this is Al Ruddy,
the producer of the film.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.552
Nice to meet you.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.553
This is perfect.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.622
We can shoot
the whole wedding sequence

00:54.722 --> 00:55.689
right on the lawn here.

00:55.789 --> 00:56.757
You like it?
I like it.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.227
Do you want to know
why I'm happy?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.461
Yes.
Brando wrote you back.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.829
He wants to do it.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.597
He wants to play the Don.

01:03.697 --> 01:04.632
We need hits.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.167
Did you read "Love Story"?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.202
What does that have to do
with anything?

01:08.302 --> 01:09.337
The audience needs
to be moved, Barry.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.739
That's how you make
hit pictures.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.529
Tonight all of Hollywood
turned out

02:41.629 --> 02:43.397
for the premiere
of "Love Story,"

02:43.497 --> 02:45.666
starring Ali MacGraw
and Ryan O'Neal.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.269
Audiences across the country
are flocking to theaters

02:48.369 --> 02:50.871
to see the adaptation
of the best-selling novel.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.373
Could this finally be the hit

02:52.473 --> 02:54.775
that turns around
Paramount's fate?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.512
It's fucking ridiculous.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.214
We should have never gone
to that premiere.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.284
I had to go.
No, you didn't.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.386
I had to support Bob.
"Love Story" is his baby.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.954
Well, it's his baby,
not yours.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.522
You didn't want to go,
you should have stayed home.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.224
Oh, but then
I would have missed everyone

03:10.324 --> 03:12.460
looking over your shoulder
for someone better to talk to.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.194
You need to learn
how to read a room, Al.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.297
I don't give a shit
about reading a room!

03:16.397 --> 03:17.765
I wouldn't have gotten
to where I am if I did.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.767
And where exactly
is that, huh?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.502
Getting embarrassed
by your peers?

03:21.602 --> 03:22.803
Were we invited
in the first place?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.238
I don't think we were.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.573
You don't know what it takes
to be a producer.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.441
You've been one
for all of seven seconds.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.209
This is the kind of shit
that you have to do.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.711
Yes.
Don't fool yourself, Al.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.613
You haven't been one
for much longer, all right?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.815
This coming from a woman
who's never built anything

03:34.915 --> 03:36.584
by herself in her life.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.985
And what do you call
the Chateau?

03:38.085 --> 03:39.620
A divorce settlement.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.926
Let's drop it.
No, no, no, no.

03:46.026 --> 03:46.960
Let's talk about this.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.897
You always do this.
It's all "Baby, it's okay."

03:49.997 --> 03:52.700
Or, "It's a joke,"
or whatever vapid remark

03:52.800 --> 03:54.935
that gets you out
of having a real conversation.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.939
So I want to have
a real conversation now.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.310
We're talking now, aren't we?

04:02.410 --> 04:05.713
The fact that you think so
is the fucking problem.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.921
I already live
on a mountaintop.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.022
Hey!

04:15.122 --> 04:16.490
Last night
was out of sight, right?

04:16.590 --> 04:17.725
How 'bout those reviews?

04:17.825 --> 04:19.259
Reviews?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.028
The critics
are raving about it.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.530
Todd, my usual.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.399
Please, stop it.
It's crazy. It's too loud.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.667
Well, maybe
a little bit louder.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.941
Bob, what a film.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.509
You made
the classic tearjerker.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.910
I mean, if Louis B.
was still alive,

04:37.010 --> 04:38.746
he'd be jealous of you.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.414
What a great party.
Sorry we had to leave early.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.582
Well, to be honest,

04:41.682 --> 04:43.317
I was surprised
you could make it at all.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.618
With literally zero cast

04:44.718 --> 04:46.354
and more budget concerns
than the Fed.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.921
Bravo, Evans.
Thank you.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.658
Look, producer's tip 101.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.660
If your movie's
on shaky ground,

04:52.760 --> 04:56.664
do not bring that vibe
to another man's premiere.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.598
Just, mm-mm, no.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.500
Thank you very much.
Got it.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.335
I'm in town
for casting meetings.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.470
Luca Brasi, Fontane,

05:02.570 --> 05:04.638
a lot of actors want in
on this picture.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.939
You don't cast Michael
and the Don,

05:06.039 --> 05:06.940
you don't have a picture.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.942
Seriously, don't give Bluhdorn

05:09.042 --> 05:10.878
a reason to pull the plug
on this one.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.481
Speaking of the Don,
I got good news.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.349
Mm-hmm?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.084
Marlon Brando is interested.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.453
Brando?
Yeah.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.489
Now I got your attention.
Yeah.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.590
For all the wrong reasons.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.057
Brando's a fucking nightmare.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.393
Box office poison.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.461
Just a very difficult
human being.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.764
Look, do you want my advice?
Always.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.332
Don't waste your time.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.001
There's plenty of other
good actors out there.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.436
Just move on
to someone realistic

05:35.536 --> 05:36.970
and use Andrea.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.539
She knows what
she's doing, man.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.741
I know.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.709
One more thing.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.411
Don't do Peter Falk.
It hurts my head.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.479
It's about Pacino.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.647
Give him another shot.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.682
Francis loves him.
No. No Pacino.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.684
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

05:50.784 --> 05:54.588
You trust my taste,
and stop it, all right?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.390
Look, "Love Story"
is poised to be

05:56.490 --> 05:57.758
one of the biggest-grossing
movies of all time,

05:57.858 --> 05:59.359
and "The Godfather"
needs to follow suit.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.629
Do you hear me?
Do you understand?

06:01.729 --> 06:06.366
Do not fuck up my streak,
all right?

06:06.467 --> 06:09.637
I don't think one movie
in a row constitutes a streak.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.540
He needs to have
his head examined.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.007
I should have
my head examined

06:14.107 --> 06:15.108
for what we're about to do.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.577
Why?

06:16.677 --> 06:19.046
He didn't say
you couldn't go after Brando.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.614
Just said it was
a waste of your time.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.883
Let's hope Bob appreciates
that distinction.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.419
I mean, Brando has canceled
this meeting four times,

06:25.519 --> 06:27.154
so maybe he won't have to.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.756
Hey, boys.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.758
Morning.

06:30.858 --> 06:35.896
So this is
the Marlon Brando's house.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.600
I imagined it differently
in my head.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.665
Mario.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.604
When I, uh, got your letter,

07:16.704 --> 07:18.005
I thought,
"This, you could do, Marlon."

07:18.105 --> 07:22.042
So thank you for allowing me
to come into your life.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.878
Well, you're Marlon Brando.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.013
Sit.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.015
Thank you.

07:30.751 --> 07:35.455
So, um, thank you so much
for having us.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.195
Have you, uh--

07:42.295 --> 07:45.599
have you seen my movie "Burn"?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.000
Uh, no.
No.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.503
Not yet.
I've never heard of it.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.476
They call me
"Burned Out Brando."

07:56.577 --> 07:58.512
I haven't heard that.

07:58.612 --> 08:03.050
I don't know who "they" is,
but they're morons.

08:03.150 --> 08:07.487
You two,
you two are good actors.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.824
Acting is a social lubricant.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.695
People lie constantly
by not saying what they think

08:14.795 --> 08:17.698
or by saying
what they don't think

08:17.798 --> 08:20.701
or not saying what they--
they mean,

08:20.801 --> 08:24.638
but saying what they think
you want to hear.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.176
Yes, and...

08:29.276 --> 08:32.913
the difference with acting
is that you're given the words.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.182
Well, dialogue changes.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
Motivation doesn't.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.723
You'd like to know
my motivation

08:42.823 --> 08:46.159
for being here
and sitting with you?

08:46.259 --> 08:48.528
Yeah.
You like the part.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.968
Sinatra hated that I sang
"Luck Be a Lady"

08:55.068 --> 08:56.804
in "Guys and Dolls."

08:56.904 --> 08:59.873
He hates "The Godfather."

08:59.973 --> 09:02.576
So...

09:02.676 --> 09:04.645
I thought I'd piss him off.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.546
That's the real reason.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.115
It's not for the money.

09:15.823 --> 09:16.924
I see you.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.060
Come on.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.098
Hello.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.834
Come on, Bettye.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.737
She works for me.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.608
Ah.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.277
You know, ever--
ever since your letter,

09:37.377 --> 09:40.113
I keep thinking about the Don.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.316
It's all I see anymore.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.587
I was--

09:47.688 --> 09:49.589
I was thinking maybe--

09:49.690 --> 09:52.592
maybe the Don
got shot in the throat,

09:52.693 --> 09:56.129
which--which
affected his voice.

09:56.229 --> 10:01.234
Maybe--maybe his jowls
droop like a bulldog.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.804
Huh.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.138
Kai.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.274
Bring me the black shoe polish.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.222
Buona sera, buona sera.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.103
Thank you again.
Bye, Kai. Bye, Marlon.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.705
Bye, Marlon.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.074
Holy shit!

11:14.174 --> 11:17.978
Tissue paper and shoe polish,
and Brando disappears.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.312
He's a genius.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.749
Francis,
you're actually smiling.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.183
Let me tell you something.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.286
John Ford, he once said
that you make one for them,

11:26.386 --> 11:28.088
and you make one for yourself.
Well, guess what.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.957
I just realized the one
that I'm making for them

11:30.057 --> 11:32.392
could be the best one
that I'm making for myself.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.727
And I'm not talking
about some upgrade

11:33.827 --> 11:35.062
to a Warner Brothers
gangster flick.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.131
Now we got a shot at making
the real thing here, people.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.332
Francis.
Yes.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.201
You're gonna make
a great film.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.770
Thank you, Bettye.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.305
Pacino and Brando
in the same frame.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.775
I'm working on it.
Okay? I promise.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.342
We're making a movie.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.344
See you later, boys.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.981
Bye.
Take care.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.949
Hopefully the guys in
the tower see what we just saw.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.250
I mean, that was incredible.
Yeah.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.852
My God, what an actor.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.487
Do you think Pacino's
actually a possibility?

12:00.587 --> 12:01.488
No.

12:01.588 --> 12:05.325
But I'll figure something out.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.894
When I started working
for you,

12:06.994 --> 12:08.962
I really wasn't sure
you knew what you were doing.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.330
Most of them time, I don't.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.766
Well, let me tell you,

12:12.866 --> 12:15.035
you're doing
something important.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.736
That's why I don't mind
trading in a love life

12:16.837 --> 12:19.272
for reading
"Godfather" rewrites.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.174
You just fucking swing.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.510
And that matters.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.446
Thanks, Bettye.
Yeah.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.516
You're gonna be late.

12:29.616 --> 12:33.420
So we've covered Vegas
and Palm Springs.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.823
Here's another one for you.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.358
What's your favorite song
to do with Dino and the boys?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.896
Let me ask you this, Bill.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.431
You want to do a puff piece,

12:44.531 --> 12:46.499
or you want to write
something real?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.036
What do you have in mind,
Frank?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.770
What does "The Times" think
of Joe Colombo

12:50.871 --> 12:54.274
and the Italian-American
Civil Rights League?

12:54.374 --> 12:57.945
More importantly,
how do you feel about it?

12:58.045 --> 12:59.813
Well, they're supposed to be
protecting

12:59.913 --> 13:01.414
the image of hardworking
Italian-Americans,

13:01.514 --> 13:04.217
but this Colombo,

13:04.317 --> 13:06.453
he hasn't done a goddamn thing
about this "Godfather" movie

13:06.553 --> 13:08.488
even though
it denigrates Italians.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.123
I'm telling you, Bill,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.559
you've got 200,000
Italian-Americans

13:12.659 --> 13:14.394
following one man,

13:14.494 --> 13:17.797
and he doesn't give a shit
about what's good for them.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.533
What do you think
he should be doing?

13:20.633 --> 13:23.370
He ought to shut
the fucking picture down.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.908
I think I'm tired.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.910
I'm tired of having
the same conversation

13:30.010 --> 13:31.511
over and over again.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.480
That makes two of us.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.417
And what conversation
is that, Francoise?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.120
Well, he's never honest
with me.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.589
And--and it's hurting me.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.557
What have I lied about?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.860
Al, you lied
about everything.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.261
You lied about Mickey Cohen

13:48.361 --> 13:50.530
and the fact that you're now
in bed with the mafia.

13:50.630 --> 13:54.567
And now you're lying about
wanting to be my partner.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.903
You are my partner.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.439
No, I'm not.
Nobody is.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.041
Francoise,

14:01.141 --> 14:04.377
can you tell Al
what you mean by that?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.848
You're placating me.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.350
You don't treat me
like an equal.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.920
Do you think I'm too delicate
or something?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.521
No, I think
you're tough as nails.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.057
Then treat me with respect.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.028
I'm sorry.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.195
I don't want you to be sorry

14:22.295 --> 14:23.630
or say what you think
I want to hear.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.233
I just want you to be real.
Be honest.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.401
That's all
I've ever asked of you.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.103
Life is complicated.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.973
I understand some things
are private. No problem.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.108
But some things aren't,
or at least they shouldn't be.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.377
And the truth
isn't complicated.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.046
It's always the truth.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.514
And if someone's your partner,
you don't bend it or avoid it.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.250
You fucking tell it.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.958
I don't want
to produce with you.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.027
I need to do this on my own.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.596
I love you.
I want to be with you.

14:56.696 --> 15:00.033
But this, this movie,

15:00.133 --> 15:03.937
I just need one thing
that's my own.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.381
Okay.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.419
I asked you for the truth,
and you gave it to me,

15:19.519 --> 15:21.621
so thank you.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.110
Ah, man, the area
north of 120 is no good.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.613
Could cause us some problems.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.615
See something you like, huh?

15:48.715 --> 15:51.318
Could arrange an introduction.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.485
All right.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.988
Let me know when window
shopping turns to buying.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.702
Carmine. Lenny.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.671
Is there some place to go?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.006
How about a seat right here?

16:13.106 --> 16:14.174
And don't worry, Carmine,

16:14.274 --> 16:16.109
we'll get a high chair
for you.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.710
Yeah.
This is business, Joe.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.146
This isn't a place to discuss--

16:19.246 --> 16:21.381
What, you don't feel safe
here in Harlem?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.588
From Colombo.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.730
$1,000?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.599
Colombo sent you
all the way up here

16:39.699 --> 16:42.402
just to fucking insult me?

16:44.237 --> 16:46.005
Go back
and tell your fucking boss

16:46.106 --> 16:47.607
I got my own family now.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.077
I don't need his charity.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.214
Known you guys
for a very long time.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.250
You got 30 seconds
to get the fuck out of here,

16:57.350 --> 16:58.618
or I'm gonna send you
back to Colombo

16:58.718 --> 17:00.220
with your heads in a box.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.092
Let's go, Lenny.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.481
Gianni, what the hell
are you doing here?

17:28.581 --> 17:29.816
Bettye Boop!

17:29.916 --> 17:31.551
Is that the way you greet
an old friend?

17:31.651 --> 17:32.785
Come here.
Give me a hug.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.555
How the hell did you
even get on the lot?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.056
You know I know people.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.057
I thought I'd surprise you.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.193
Brought you something.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.365
Wow. A whole scone.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.600
Yeah, I got it on the road
from this little cafe

17:47.700 --> 17:49.769
that'll change your life,
right outside of Vegas.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.205
Hand to God,
the best pastries in the world.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.073
Hey. Who's this?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.109
You're Al Ruddy, right?
Yeah, that's me.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.577
Just the man
I was looking for.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.778
Al, this is Gianni Russo.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.347
He used to date
a girlfriend of mine,

18:00.447 --> 18:02.782
but he was just leaving.
But first, sir,

18:02.882 --> 18:05.185
I brought you something.
Oh, what, another scone?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.154
Nah, something much better.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.555
Gianni, you cannot just
bring your reel.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.856
I can't just what?

18:09.956 --> 18:12.525
Al's got a movie to cast.
Ain't that right, Al?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.827
I'm just helping him.
Nice of you to stop by.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.130
A transistor radio
changed my life.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.465
Hand to God.
Listen to this.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.866
You're never gonna believe
this shit.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.203
I heard Frank Sinatra on it,
and I thought to myself,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.638
"He's Italian. I'm Italian--"

18:25.738 --> 18:27.674
Wait, wait, wait.
You're Italian?

18:27.774 --> 18:28.808
My point is,

18:28.908 --> 18:30.810
is if he can do it,
why not me?

18:30.910 --> 18:32.279
Who could argue
with that logic?

18:32.379 --> 18:33.613
You gotta watch
the whole thing.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.747
It's incredible.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.549
I did Michael, Sonny,
and the Don.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.418
Ha! Wow, that is
a hell of a hat trick.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.353
Hopefully
not all at the same time.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.322
I just figured those are
the ones I'd be believable in.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.557
Well, if you need any help with
any research, I'm your guy.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.826
"The Godfather"
ain't got nothing on my life.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.561
Hand to God.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.230
At the very least,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.599
Gianni just marked three roles
off our casting slate.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.201
That's a relief.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.203
Evans wants to have
a state of the union tomorrow

18:56.303 --> 18:57.504
before we head back
to New York.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.406
Hi. We put a bunch
of Dons on tape.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.140
Anthony Quinn. Danny Thomas.
We'll show him then.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.742
What about Fontane?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.178
Francis likes Al Martino
for it.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.179
I have no idea who that is,

19:06.979 --> 19:07.480
but if Francis likes him,
I'm good.

19:08.348 --> 19:08.748
Have you spoken to Francis
about casting

19:09.416 --> 19:10.283
his sister Talia for Connie?

19:11.150 --> 19:11.484
She's strong.
She wants to do the role.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.453
He's got enough drama
with the Corleone family.

19:14.321 --> 19:14.921
He may not want
to involve his own.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.390
And dare I bring up Michael?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.292
Has Evans approved Pacino
for the role?

19:19.392 --> 19:20.860
Francis has a better chance
of seeing God

19:20.960 --> 19:22.329
than getting Pacino that part.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.764
He's tested four times.
Caan is a strong choice.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.899
Francis will never go for it.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.901
Bluhdorn saw Pacino
off-Broadway,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.437
and he likes him,
if that helps.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.938
Not while Evans is
still running this place.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.606
He's angling
for Redford or Nicholson.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.941
How the fuck you know
what Bluhdorn likes?

19:35.041 --> 19:37.710
'Cause I did my homework.
Oh, teacher's pet.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.312
What about
Falk for Moe Green?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.780
Can we get him
out of his NBC deal?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.282
No longer interested.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.217
He said, and I quote,
"I had to hire a detective

19:44.317 --> 19:46.185
to find the part,
and I still couldn't."

19:46.286 --> 19:48.921
Can one fucking thing
go right with this picture?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.690
I mean,
is that too much to ask?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.426
I got a script
the size of an encyclopedia,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.328
a budget that's less than
Bluhdorn spends

19:55.428 --> 19:56.929
on cigars in a month, no cast.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.298
We got Duvall in for Hagen.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.467
He a great actor.
Changes nothing.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.635
What about Brando?
We don't have Brando.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.305
What we have
is a silent 8-millimeter film

20:05.405 --> 20:07.240
to try and get him approved,
which, let's be honest,

20:07.340 --> 20:08.575
that could blow up
in our faces.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.377
I got a director in love
with the shortest unknown actor

20:10.943 --> 20:11.778
on the fucking planet,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.714
and Biaggi's making waves.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.450
Am I forgetting anything?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.719
No.
I'm pretty sure that covers it.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.694
He's having a day.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.730
Evidently, yeah.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.600
I think that Gianni guy
would be good for Carlo.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.269
Are you serious, Ruddy?
The guy is a schmuck.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.305
Typecasting at its best.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.006
Show it to Francis.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.411
Who?
Don't ask.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.384
I'll tell you what,
Ol' Blue Eyes better start

20:51.484 --> 20:52.852
using that microphone
for singing,

20:52.952 --> 20:53.986
or I'm gonna strangle him
with it.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.488
What's it say?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.624
Motherfucker's questioning
my loyalty to my people.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.792
You want me to do something
about it?

20:59.892 --> 21:02.495
I think it's a little more
complicated than that.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.963
How'd it go?

21:04.063 --> 21:06.265
Not good.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.601
He was out of order, Joe.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.036
He wasn't happy.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.838
He said it was an insult.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.307
Because it was.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.576
And now we watch.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.445
Gallo's gonna do
something crazy.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.847
Then I'm gonna go back
to the Commission

21:20.947 --> 21:22.982
and get the okay
to take him out.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.984
What do you want to do
about Sinatra?

21:25.084 --> 21:27.820
You know, if I let
a wannabe tough guy singer

21:27.920 --> 21:30.022
and a corrupt congressman
beat me at this,

21:30.122 --> 21:31.324
I might as well move to Boca.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.394
I gotta double down
on this movie.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.974
I love this tune.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.343
Yes, mama.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.787
Hey, baby.
Hello.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.655
You smell good.
Mm.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.062
It could be important.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.465
I got it, I got it.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.902
Yello.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.437
Jack!

22:17.537 --> 22:19.038
Jackie, baby,
what's going on, man?

22:19.138 --> 22:20.607
How you doing?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.976
I'm good.
I'm good, I'm good.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.645
Huh?

22:25.745 --> 22:27.346
Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her.
Yeah.

22:27.447 --> 22:28.948
Hey, did you see those
box office numbers, baby?

22:29.048 --> 22:31.117
Evans.
Yeah, right?

22:31.217 --> 22:33.553
It's Nicholson.
It's Jack.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.022
Hey, look, that's not
the reason I called earlier.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.390
No.

22:37.490 --> 22:40.493
"The Godfather,"
the role of Michael.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.828
Listen, star,
you can play anything.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.730
Irish, Italian,
what's the difference?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.932
You make it your own, baby.
You're the "Easy Rider."

22:46.032 --> 22:47.500
No one can put a tag on you.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.536
And when I say, "Easy Rider,"
it's not a tag,

22:49.636 --> 22:50.737
it's a compliment.

22:50.837 --> 22:51.971
You son of a bitch.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.974
I know.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.844
Yeah, run
the agreement and get it done!

22:57.944 --> 23:00.012
Get the car ready.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.481
Hello.

23:01.581 --> 23:02.649
Mr. Director.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.851
Charlie,
can I get a minute?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.519
No.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.865
I have something
you need to see.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.400
What, the Coppola family
goes to Coney Island?

23:21.501 --> 23:22.569
I promise you it's important.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.136
Yeah, well make
an appointment, Francis.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.506
Charlie,
what I have to show you,

23:26.606 --> 23:28.407
it's the difference
between a good movie

23:28.508 --> 23:30.510
and a cinematic classic.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.778
You gotta see it.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.963
Hey.
Did you slip it in?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.699
Thanks.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.468
Hi, Bob.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.570
We've got Oscar winners
lined up for you to see.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.806
We've got Steiger,
Anthony Quinn, Ernest Borgnine.

23:59.906 --> 24:00.873
I don't know
why the hell we're doing this

24:01.741 --> 24:02.141
without Francis.
I need his opinion.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.143
Where is he?
He's in New York.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.712
What the fuck
is he doing in New York?

24:05.812 --> 24:08.180
Anyone?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.882
Yes?

24:09.982 --> 24:11.017
Got it, got it.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.218
It's Charlie.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.920
He wants us to watch something.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.055
Huh?

24:16.155 --> 24:18.525
Hi, Charlie.
We're starting now.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.627
Mm.

24:26.766 --> 24:27.934
Who is that?

24:28.034 --> 24:29.936
Is that Rod Steiger?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.171
That's not Steiger.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.173
Look at those eyes.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.642
Is that Brando?

24:35.742 --> 24:38.745
It's fucking magic.
I love it. I love it!

24:38.845 --> 24:40.146
It's the first time
I got a clue

24:40.246 --> 24:41.648
of what Francis wants to do.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.783
I'm sorry, but what does

24:43.883 --> 24:48.020
a silent, three-minute
home movie prove?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.823
It proves...

24:50.923 --> 24:53.693
that he's still
the greatest actor of our time.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.562
Brando will bring
something no one expects.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.096
'Cause he's a nutcase!

24:57.196 --> 24:58.698
The budget will skyrocket.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.700
No, guys, he'll play ball.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.135
He invited us to his home.
He let us put him on film.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.171
Okay? He wants to do this.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.573
I mean, look at the screen.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.541
You can't take
your eyes off him.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.645
Charlie...

25:12.745 --> 25:15.715
you're watching
something very special.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.293
Evans, he works for scale.
All right.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.595
BLUHDORN
And puts up a bond.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.529
Make it a million dollars.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.565
That way, he doesn't pull
any of his games.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.300
Sure.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.907
Marlon Brando.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.910
He's great, right?

25:44.010 --> 25:46.178
Yeah, he's great.

25:46.278 --> 25:49.048
If we lock him in,
it's a go picture?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.050
Mm-hmm.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.185
It worked out for you
this time, kid.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.828
Don't ever try
and go around me again.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.832
Not gonna happen.
Thanks, Bob.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.115
What are you reading?

26:29.288 --> 26:32.291
They finally approved
Brando today.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.594
It's a big deal.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.130
So you're heading back
to New York.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.869
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.972
Things are just really starting
to move fast now.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.309
Francoise, I don't know
what you want from me.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.778
Yes, you do.

26:51.878 --> 26:54.681
It's not just the same
as what you want from me.

26:57.884 --> 27:01.721
"The Godfather" is a threat
to our very existence.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.990
It's an insult
to our businesses,

27:04.090 --> 27:05.291
to our culture.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.326
This picture is an assault

27:07.426 --> 27:09.796
on Italian-Americans
everywhere.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.931
And as a public servant,
I have to address

27:12.031 --> 27:13.833
the concerns
of my constituents

27:13.933 --> 27:17.670
and hold everyone behind
"The Godfather" accountable.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.071
Thank you.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.741
Fuck. Fuck.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.010
And that is only
the beginning.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.746
There's a Biaggi piece
in the "Chicago Sun-Times."

27:26.846 --> 27:29.381
"The Tribune" quotes
some Italian baker

27:29.481 --> 27:31.851
that "The Godfather"
is blasphemous

27:31.951 --> 27:33.285
and he's gonna boycott
"Love Story."

27:33.385 --> 27:34.653
Fuck.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.824
And Sinatra
is on record as well.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.993
If you ever do decide
to sell Paramount,

27:41.093 --> 27:43.996
no buyer is gonna
want to touch us.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.899
This is turning
into a fucking fiasco.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.938
Charlie.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.073
Ruddy needs to be supervised.
All right?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.942
He's in way over his head
with this kind of stuff.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.278
And one small,
little misstep from him

27:59.378 --> 28:01.380
is gonna be a disaster.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.214
It's our fault.

28:02.314 --> 28:05.317
We gave him
too much responsibility.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.286
One low-budget biker film

28:07.386 --> 28:09.321
and a sitcom
that he walked away from--

28:09.421 --> 28:10.790
that's his résumé.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.894
But I don't care
about how he got Marlon Brando

28:14.994 --> 28:17.463
in his little home movie,
all right?

28:17.563 --> 28:20.466
We need to do something
to save this movie.

28:20.566 --> 28:23.302
And we need to do it now.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.071
Talk to legal.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.173
Let me know
what our options are.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.475
Okay.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.079
I gotta tell you, Marlon,

28:33.179 --> 28:37.083
Jimmy Cagney told me
he thinks that you are

28:37.183 --> 28:39.218
the transformative actor
of your art form.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.354
Well...

28:42.454 --> 28:45.958
after the war, people
were looking for rebellion.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.461
I happened to be at the right
place at the right time

28:49.561 --> 28:51.263
with the right state of mind.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.199
Well, you're at the right
time with "The Godfather."

28:53.299 --> 28:54.400
We want you for it.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.836
We just need to talk
about your approach,

28:56.936 --> 29:00.206
not just creative,
but as part of the team.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.110
We need to know that
you're gonna play nice, Marlon.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.279
Play nice?

29:07.379 --> 29:08.881
Mm.

29:10.817 --> 29:13.152
What is this?
A sandbox?

29:15.054 --> 29:17.056
Who are you?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.326
What?

29:20.426 --> 29:23.495
We're just talking
things through here.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.997
I don't talk things through.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.966
That's what I have
an agent for.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.200
I know that.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.036
But this is in the spirit
of how we're making the movie.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.371
We got no problem
with your artistry

29:32.471 --> 29:34.040
or your chemistry with Francis.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.042
We just need to know
that you'll accept

29:36.142 --> 29:38.177
that we're working
on a limited budget, man.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.046
That's all.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.115
Cagney said that?

29:43.215 --> 29:44.450
Mm.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.819
That means so much to me.

29:53.359 --> 29:56.929
I have a--I have a suggestion
for Michael, if I may.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.497
Well,
I'd love to hear it, Marlon.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.132
Who are you thinking?

30:00.232 --> 30:01.300
Well, he's a--

30:01.400 --> 30:03.335
he's a great theater actor.

30:03.435 --> 30:08.975
He won an award
for "Tiger in the Bowtie."

30:09.075 --> 30:12.244
This kid, you can't take
your eyes off of him.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.880
Al Pacino.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.951
Yeah, I never heard of him.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.256
Oh, that's gonna go
straight down the hall

30:24.356 --> 30:25.257
and to the left.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.493
How was your flight?
Long and bumpy.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.296
And?
Everything at home?

30:30.396 --> 30:31.998
Don't ask.
Roger that.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.901
Hey, anything on Brando?

30:35.001 --> 30:36.335
Home run on the offices,
Ruddy.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.037
That's all Bettye.
Aww.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.438
Your office is right here.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.141
I've got Evans.
In my office.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.582
Hi, Bob. I've got Al
and Francis with me.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.118
Did you find me
a Michael yet?

30:52.218 --> 30:53.519
Hey, Bob.
I didn't think so.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.454
Francis, stop pimping Pacino.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.455
Brando couldn't even get
the name

30:56.555 --> 30:58.124
of Pacino's play right.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.591
So, Brando,
you nail him down?

30:59.691 --> 31:00.626
Nail him down?

31:00.726 --> 31:02.628
He's like
nailing jelly to a tree.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.196
Look, we need a deal at scale.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.531
We need him bonded
for a million.

31:05.631 --> 31:06.966
And we need his signature.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.567
This is your shot, Ruddy.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.369
You nail him down.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.274
Bettye, get Irv Goldstein.
Yes.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.044
Why does he have such
a hard-on against Pacino?

31:18.144 --> 31:20.546
Francis, look, please.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.115
Al Ruddy for Irv Goldstein.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.152
I have Goldstein.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.954
You know how
to play hardball?

31:28.054 --> 31:30.089
I invented the game.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.892
Irv.
You're one lucky SOB.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.928
Mr. Brando
never wants to work,

31:36.028 --> 31:37.930
but I convinced him
for 100 grand a week,

31:38.030 --> 31:39.165
five-week guarantee,

31:39.265 --> 31:41.433
with his usual perks
to do your movie.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.568
Way to go.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.403
Irv, it's a $4 million picture.

31:44.503 --> 31:45.972
Everybody works for scale.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.539
Then Marlon
isn't in the picture.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.575
That's right.
Who else you gonna get?

31:49.675 --> 31:52.244
There's always
somebody else.
No, there's nobody else.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.680
Irv, Andrea Eastman here.
Oh, Jesus.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.482
Do you know who passed
on "Casablanca"

31:56.582 --> 31:57.616
before Bogart took the role?

31:57.716 --> 31:58.985
Yeah, Ronald Reagan,

31:59.085 --> 32:00.186
I know that one.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.988
Tell Coppola
Reagan's available.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.055
Reagan's, um--

32:03.155 --> 32:05.191
The deal
is scale plus five points

32:05.291 --> 32:07.059
once box office
hits $50 million.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.527
Pass.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.196
Here comes Anthony Quinn.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.930
No!

32:12.031 --> 32:13.932
What are you--
what are you doing?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.035
Bottle of Dom Pérignon
he calls back in five,

32:16.135 --> 32:19.305
four, three, two, one.

32:27.213 --> 32:27.980
Fuck.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.684
It's Goldstein.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.520
Yes, I will connect you.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.527
This is a no quote deal.
That's right.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.130
You go over, you pay.
That's right.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.032
Welcome
to the world of Marlon Brando.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.403
What--how did you know
that he would call back?

32:51.503 --> 32:54.140
Because he needs us
more than we need him.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.375
Al Ruddy,

32:56.475 --> 32:59.011
you're under arrest.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.380
Sonny.
What's up, buddy?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.182
You don't start till next week,
you know that, right?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.983
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, okay.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.452
Uh, everybody,
this is Sonny Grosso.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.721
He's ex-NYPD and overall fixer
for guys like us.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.657
He's from "French Connection."

33:11.757 --> 33:12.724
That was me.

33:13.592 --> 33:14.060
Billy Friedkin
is a good friend of mine.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.328
Billy is the best.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.098
You got a second to talk?
Yeah.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.999
- How you been?
- I'm good. You?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.201
Yeah, good.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.569
Finally getting going
on this thing.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.004
Yeah, good, good.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.741
What do I need this for?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.210
Look, I know you think

33:31.310 --> 33:32.511
you know what you're doing,
all right?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.346
But you don't, okay?

33:34.446 --> 33:37.583
Getting into bed
with Joe Colombo?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.218
That's a bad idea.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.719
And from what I understand,
it's already done.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.422
You gotta protect yourself.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.524
Colombo's been nothing
but a friend to me.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.658
I'm covered.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.260
Honestly.

33:50.496 --> 33:51.730
You, uh--

33:51.830 --> 33:55.267
you ever hear
of Crazy Joe Gallo?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.235
Maniac.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.703
Former Profaci capo.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.671
Murdered the boss,
Albert Anastasia.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.573
He recently got out of jail.

34:01.673 --> 34:02.808
What's that got to do
with me?

34:02.908 --> 34:04.510
If Gallo comes gunning
for Colombo

34:04.610 --> 34:05.677
like I think he will,

34:06.778 --> 34:08.180
he either, I don't know,
tries to take over your movie,

34:09.115 --> 34:10.149
or worse, you get caught
with a stray bullet.

34:10.249 --> 34:13.119
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.354
But I appreciate the warning.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.323
And this.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.491
If you get
into a bad situation,

34:19.591 --> 34:21.460
that'll buy you some time.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.762
Maybe.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.831
Thanks.
I'll see you.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.474
Hey.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.743
What a nice surprise.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.578
I didn't know
you were coming today.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.351
What's wrong?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.221
I'm not staying.

34:49.321 --> 34:52.724
I'm--I'm going to Paris.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.161
Paris?

34:55.261 --> 34:56.728
I just need to get away.

34:56.828 --> 35:00.098
Clear my head.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.268
But I wanted to say goodbye.

35:06.272 --> 35:09.141
When you get back, we can--

35:09.241 --> 35:11.610
we'll talk.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.312
Really talk,
the way that you wanted us to.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.814
I'm not coming back, Al.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.683
Not to this.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.822
I want to be with you.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.224
All of you

35:25.324 --> 35:27.826
or none of you.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.328
There is a simple way
to save your relationship,

36:02.428 --> 36:04.396
if you want to.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.831
Tell me.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.934
Get on a plane
and get on your knees.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.773
I understand
why you won't, though.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.175
Thank you.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.778
I got divorced a few years ago.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.280
Did you know that?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.215
You mentioned it.
Yeah.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.783
Childhood sweethearts.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.818
He grew up
down the block from me.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.287
Not a single memory I have

36:28.387 --> 36:31.457
where we weren't planning
our future together.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.825
And he had this phenomenal ass.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.562
Whoo!

36:36.662 --> 36:38.564
Well, what happened?

36:38.664 --> 36:40.466
Life, I guess.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.601
I don't know, we got older,

36:42.701 --> 36:45.904
realized we didn't want
the same things anymore.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.639
I wanted to have a career.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.708
He wanted me to bake pies.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.412
I hate fucking pies.

36:53.512 --> 36:57.416
I'm sorry, Bettye.
I'm not.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.719
I am not gonna change
for anyone.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.455
What I want or who I am.

37:10.462 --> 37:14.366
Was it easy to walk away?

37:14.466 --> 37:15.834
No.

37:19.004 --> 37:23.241
Sometimes I think
about how hard this is.

37:23.342 --> 37:26.278
All the time,
every single turn.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.750
It's like the universe
has made my balls

37:31.850 --> 37:33.852
its own personal punching bag.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.857
And yet,

37:38.957 --> 37:40.626
I still can't seem
to walk away.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.398
Then go after the girl.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.702
I wasn't talking
about the girl.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.579
Cheers.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.452
Morning, Bettye.

38:06.552 --> 38:08.554
Need you call P.J. Clarke's,
get a table for dinner.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.656
Now that Brando's on the movie,
it's finally a go.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.723
We gotta celebrate.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.926
Al. Al!
What? What is it?

38:15.026 --> 38:17.396
Is that Al Ruddy I hear?

38:24.903 --> 38:26.772
Joe.
What are you doing here?

38:26.872 --> 38:28.006
Look at his face.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.408
Look at--
look at the worry on his face.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.776
He does look
fucking worried.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.344
I'm not worried.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.712
What is this?
It's a cannoli.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.481
It's the best cannoli
in Brooklyn.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.715
Joe, you didn't
have to do that.

38:36.815 --> 38:37.849
I appreciate it.

38:37.949 --> 38:38.984
Hey, look at this.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.986
Look at this.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.755
That's for you right there.
Oh.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.624
Hey.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.025
Have that.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.961
You're one of us now, kid.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.797
We need each other, all right?

38:51.897 --> 38:53.064
We gotta trust each other.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.533
Yeah, of course.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.834
Sinatra's still
a problem for me.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.068
Problem for you too.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.505
I may have
a solution to that.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.072
He doesn't want
to be humiliated, right?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.608
Yeah.
That Fontaine character's

39:02.708 --> 39:03.875
in almost a third of the book.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.343
Tell him, thanks to you,

39:05.444 --> 39:06.578
I was able to cut
that character down

39:06.678 --> 39:08.780
to two scenes in the movie.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.382
You can do that?

39:10.482 --> 39:12.451
I mean, it's a lot of work
re-typing those scripts,

39:12.551 --> 39:14.453
but, Joe, for you,
we can do anything.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.121
We're so grateful
to have your support, truly.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.123
This guy.
This guy!

39:18.223 --> 39:19.891
As his own tribe would say,

39:19.991 --> 39:21.092
a mensch.
A mensch.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.594
I'll make sure to tell
Frank personally.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.862
Please do.
All right, bye. Bye. Bye.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.997
Thanks, Joe.
Bye.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.365
Damn it!

39:27.466 --> 39:28.800
We lost the Staten Island
compound.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.135
That was Lovano.

39:30.235 --> 39:31.670
What do you mean
we lost it?
We lost it.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.739
Lovano, the owner,
he backed out.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.575
I need that house.
The whole thing came alive...

39:36.675 --> 39:38.376
Al? Al.
When I saw the house--

39:38.477 --> 39:40.612
The world's looking for you,
including Bluhdorn.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.014
He wants to you by end of day.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.516
Okay.
Francis, I'll deal with it.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.918
Just--just give me a minute,
and I'll work on it.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.788
Okay.
All right?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.157
Hey.

39:52.257 --> 39:54.526
What's that about?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.394
Colombo pinned me.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.065
That meant something
very different

40:00.165 --> 40:02.534
when I was in high school.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.037
"The Godfather"
is important,

40:06.137 --> 40:07.906
but it's becoming a problem.

40:08.006 --> 40:08.840
What's the problem?

40:09.708 --> 40:12.077
We just got Brando.
We're greenlit.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.645
The problem is the bad press

40:13.745 --> 40:15.113
that the picture is getting.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.082
I mean, Sinatra, Biaggi,

40:17.182 --> 40:19.050
it's coming at us
from all sides.

40:19.150 --> 40:22.954
Ruddy, we want to
give you some help.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.956
What kind of help?

40:26.525 --> 40:27.959
Al...

40:28.059 --> 40:29.828
We should be partners.

40:29.928 --> 40:30.596
No.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.498
Jack is gonna produce
with you.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.533
He knows how
the press operates.

40:34.633 --> 40:35.867
He can take
that burden off you.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.003
And he's gonna be on set
with you anyway.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.739
Just to have your back, help
with the extra heavy weight.

40:40.839 --> 40:41.607
I got it.

40:42.307 --> 40:43.909
What's Evans think about this?

40:44.009 --> 40:45.811
Ask him.
He's listening.

40:45.911 --> 40:48.146
I said let's hear
what you have to say.

40:48.246 --> 40:51.149
We're all ears.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.852
Well, I'm assuming,
for the three of you

40:53.952 --> 40:55.153
to get this whole party
together,

40:55.253 --> 40:56.688
you already talked to legal.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.624
So?
So my contract states

40:58.724 --> 40:59.791
I'm the sole producer
on this project.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.893
Al, it's not unusual
for the producer

41:01.993 --> 41:03.495
to get a little help.
It's unusual for me.

41:03.595 --> 41:04.696
That's why
I negotiated it that way.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.733
This guy got suckered
into a pissing contest

41:07.833 --> 41:09.701
with Sinatra, Biaggi,
and the Italian League.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.603
Sinatra's not gonna be
a problem. I took care of it.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.773
Charlie, I'm the sole producer
on this project.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.775
If Jack wants to come along
and join the party, fine.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.077
I'll even get him
a fancy chair on set.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.846
But I'm doing this on my own.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.648
I'm not putting my neck
on the line every day

41:22.748 --> 41:24.583
to make you a great movie
so that Jack or anybody else

41:24.683 --> 41:26.852
can second-guess me.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.854
I make the calls.

41:30.255 --> 41:33.224
Evans?

41:33.324 --> 41:34.993
I'm with Ruddy.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.131
Fine.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.067
But a word
to the wise, Ruddy.

41:44.770 --> 41:48.574
When you fail alone,
there's no one else to blame.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.709
That's the only way
I want it.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.086
All right.

42:01.186 --> 42:04.289
I just want to thank all of you
for coming tonight.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.124
Now that we are
finally greenlit,

42:06.224 --> 42:07.726
we can really get
the ball rolling.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.761
Closed our deals
with Dean Tavoularis

42:09.861 --> 42:11.730
for production design,

42:11.830 --> 42:14.299
and Gordy Willis is gonna
head up cinematography.

42:14.399 --> 42:17.168
It's really an incredible team.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.638
But I will defer
to the artists.

42:19.738 --> 42:23.041
Captain, my captain,
Francis, toast.

42:23.141 --> 42:25.310
Yes. Whoo!

42:25.410 --> 42:26.812
Mario, you do the honors.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.314
No, Francis.
Come on, this is your show.

42:29.414 --> 42:30.849
I mean,
I could say a few words,

42:31.983 --> 42:34.753
but it would take me at least
a month to write it, so...

42:34.853 --> 42:38.256
Take it away.
Take it away, boss.

42:38.356 --> 42:40.659
Okay.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.862
Well, I'm very honored
and humbled

42:43.962 --> 42:46.097
to be surrounded
by such talented people.

42:46.197 --> 42:49.100
I hope I deserve you.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.602
Um...

42:53.404 --> 42:55.774
We're making a movie.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.743
And you're only allotted,

42:57.843 --> 42:59.577
you know, a certain amount
of time during the day

42:59.678 --> 43:01.613
to get everything done.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.915
And you want everything
just perfect.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.052
Every shot.

43:07.152 --> 43:10.055
But sometimes it's great,

43:10.155 --> 43:13.224
and it's out of focus.

43:13.324 --> 43:17.629
Sometimes
a dolly wheel squeaks.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.597
Sometimes it's magic,

43:19.698 --> 43:22.167
and the actor
goes up on their line.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.771
So you do it again,

43:25.871 --> 43:27.072
you check the gate,
you move on.

43:27.172 --> 43:28.173
Cheers.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.782
To "The Godfather."

43:36.882 --> 43:38.917
To "The Godfather."
To "The Godfather."

43:39.017 --> 43:40.652
All right.
Okay, enjoy yourselves.

43:40.752 --> 43:43.354
Wh--where you going?
We didn't even order yet.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.857
I know. I gotta run.
I'm late.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.226
I gotta go to Martin Scorsese's
parents' house,

43:48.326 --> 43:50.829
tape their conversations
over dinner.

43:50.929 --> 43:53.699
For the accents.
For the actors.

43:53.799 --> 43:55.767
I'll see you all later.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.673
Hey, Francis.
What's going on?

44:01.773 --> 44:03.208
Everything okay?

44:03.308 --> 44:05.243
That was kind of
a weird toast.

44:05.343 --> 44:08.079
Look, Van Gogh
paints sunflowers, okay?

44:08.179 --> 44:09.715
He needed a particular
shade of yellow.

44:09.815 --> 44:11.783
No yellow, no sunflowers.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.919
I feel like
I'm going to have to cave

44:14.019 --> 44:17.122
on the particular yellow
that I want, right?

44:17.222 --> 44:20.058
And the dreams that I have.

44:20.158 --> 44:21.727
Without Pacino,

44:21.827 --> 44:24.395
this whole movie
is not gonna quite work,

44:24.495 --> 44:26.364
and then my dreams
won't happen.

44:26.464 --> 44:27.866
I'll make a good enough movie,

44:27.966 --> 44:30.969
but that will break my heart,
which will kill me.

44:31.069 --> 44:32.738
Wait.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.144
Is everything okay?

44:39.244 --> 44:42.247
I need to see Charlie alone,
as soon as possible.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.282
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.

44:44.382 --> 44:46.151
Hey.

44:46.251 --> 44:49.921
Some of your special friends
are here.

44:54.492 --> 44:57.062
I just want to sleep.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.196
Get me a drink.

45:06.805 --> 45:08.306
Al.
What's going on, Joe?

45:08.406 --> 45:09.908
I got something for you.

45:10.008 --> 45:12.077
Forgive me, but when I was
leaving your office,

45:12.177 --> 45:13.812
I overhead something
about a problem

45:13.912 --> 45:14.980
with the Staten Island house.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.481
That location
was important to you, yeah?

45:16.581 --> 45:18.716
Yeah, but we'll find
something else.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.986
Yeah, but that's
the one you wanted, right?

45:21.086 --> 45:22.720
It's okay.
These things happen.

45:22.821 --> 45:25.957
Come here, come here,
come here.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.144
You remember him?

45:48.013 --> 45:49.514
Peter, Peter, stop crying.

45:49.614 --> 45:51.783
I ain't gonna hurt you.

45:51.883 --> 45:54.786
I don't want no trouble.
Please.

45:54.886 --> 45:56.421
I have a family.

45:56.521 --> 45:58.289
We all got a family, Peter.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.926
But you got a signed contract
to rent your house

46:01.026 --> 46:02.193
to "The Godfather" movie.

46:02.293 --> 46:04.129
That's a project
that's very important to me.

46:04.229 --> 46:05.263
You understand that?

46:05.363 --> 46:06.998
But Congressman Biaggi,

46:07.098 --> 46:08.867
he says it's bad
for us Italians.

46:08.967 --> 46:10.335
You got a problem
with certain people,

46:10.435 --> 46:12.804
you should come to me for help.
We're all Italian here.

46:12.904 --> 46:15.773
We all want to see
this movie get made.

46:15.874 --> 46:18.810
Why not use another house?

46:21.479 --> 46:23.949
"Use another house."

46:24.049 --> 46:25.917
Is that what you just said?

46:27.953 --> 46:30.121
You want to rethink that?

46:37.528 --> 46:40.231
I'll do it.

46:40.331 --> 46:42.133
Take the house.

46:42.233 --> 46:45.370
No money.
No, you're gonna get paid.

46:45.470 --> 46:48.473
After all,
what are we, animals?

46:48.573 --> 46:50.808
Take him home.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.110
Al, come here.

47:03.454 --> 47:05.490
Oh, thank God.

47:05.590 --> 47:06.992
Al.

47:13.631 --> 47:17.135
What happened?

47:17.235 --> 47:20.038
We got the Staten Island
house back.

47:20.138 --> 47:21.306
Okay.

47:22.373 --> 47:24.409
Colombo bullied the owner
into giving it back to us.

47:26.244 --> 47:28.113
The guy pissed himself,
he was so scared.

47:28.213 --> 47:31.182
He thought that they were
gonna fucking kill him.

47:33.251 --> 47:35.353
So did I, actually.

47:38.123 --> 47:41.960
I've never felt so dirty
in my life.

47:43.962 --> 47:46.164
Why would you ask him
for help?

47:46.264 --> 47:48.066
I didn't.

47:48.166 --> 47:50.969
He overheard Francis
tell me about it.

47:52.470 --> 47:56.041
The last thing I want is
to be in his debt, trust me.

47:57.108 --> 47:59.477
Can't get the picture
of that guy out of my head.

48:06.317 --> 48:09.054
You said you need
to talk to Charlie?

48:09.154 --> 48:12.991
He'll be at the Belmont
Race Track tomorrow morning.

48:13.091 --> 48:14.592
How do you know that?

48:14.692 --> 48:17.028
I'm supposed
to meet him there.

48:31.242 --> 48:32.610
What the fuck
are you doing here?

48:32.710 --> 48:34.512
Expecting someone else?

48:34.612 --> 48:37.182
Ha, yeah,
someone a lot cuter.

48:37.282 --> 48:38.449
Well...

48:39.550 --> 48:41.419
I didn't know you had horses.
Yeah, I love horses.

48:41.519 --> 48:43.554
Who doesn't love a sick way
to lose money, you know?

48:43.654 --> 48:45.590
Look,
I'm gonna make this quick.

48:45.690 --> 48:47.658
We need to cast Michael.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.195
Francis and Evans
are deadlocked over Pacino,

48:50.295 --> 48:52.697
and I need you to make
an executive decision

48:52.797 --> 48:55.100
so we can get this movie made.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.968
Side with Francis.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.239
Why?

49:01.339 --> 49:03.608
You saw what he did
with Brando.

49:03.708 --> 49:04.709
I mean, you should trust him.

49:04.809 --> 49:05.977
He's an artist.
He's got integrity.

49:06.077 --> 49:07.345
Yeah, I love Brando,

49:07.445 --> 49:11.116
but artistic integrity,
all this bullshit...

49:11.216 --> 49:13.251
You think Francis is right?

49:15.220 --> 49:16.654
I do.

49:16.754 --> 49:18.956
Pacino's the guy.

49:20.658 --> 49:22.560
Jesus, Ruddy.

49:22.660 --> 49:23.694
Evans gave you your shot.

49:24.629 --> 49:25.396
He's just backed you
as a sole producer.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.365
You really think
about what you're doing here.

49:28.233 --> 49:30.268
If I say yes,
he's gonna be pissed.

49:32.137 --> 49:34.039
It's what the movie needs.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.179
Fine.

49:41.279 --> 49:42.113
Thanks.

49:42.213 --> 49:45.416
Good luck out there.
Yeah.

49:45.516 --> 49:47.418
You too.

49:55.693 --> 49:57.128
- Honey.
- Hmm?

49:57.228 --> 49:58.596
I booked a private dinner
at Perino's tonight

49:58.696 --> 50:01.332
with all the key foreign press
for the Golden Globes.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.734
We've gone out 11 nights
in the past two weeks.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.103
This is your time.

50:05.203 --> 50:06.604
When they come,
you have to answer.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.339
I want to stay home and read.

50:08.439 --> 50:10.141
This book is far more
interesting

50:10.241 --> 50:12.143
than another dinner party.
Ali, baby,

50:12.243 --> 50:13.144
you're the biggest star
in the world.

50:13.244 --> 50:15.280
Oscar nominations
are right around the corner,

50:15.380 --> 50:16.747
and the Golden Globes
get the buzz going.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.184
Come on.

50:22.753 --> 50:24.355
Thank you.

50:30.895 --> 50:32.263
Yello.

50:34.399 --> 50:35.700
What?

50:35.800 --> 50:37.102
Al?

50:37.202 --> 50:38.403
Evans is on the phone.

50:40.638 --> 50:42.540
Okay.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.579
Shut the door.

50:48.679 --> 50:49.680
Mm-hmm.

50:57.422 --> 50:59.757
You motherfucking Judas.

50:59.857 --> 51:02.127
I warned you
not to go around me.

51:02.227 --> 51:03.694
Bob, look,

51:03.794 --> 51:05.062
that's not
what I was trying to do.

51:05.163 --> 51:06.431
You ungrateful fuck.

51:06.531 --> 51:08.699
Charlie Bluhdorn sells
auto parts, sugar, cigars,

51:08.799 --> 51:10.401
and a tiny part
of his business is Paramount.

51:10.501 --> 51:12.470
He could sell it off tomorrow
and not give a fuck.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.672
I took a chance on you,
and you stabbed me in the back.

51:14.772 --> 51:16.774
I don't like Pacino!

51:16.874 --> 51:18.376
He's a huge mistake.

51:18.476 --> 51:19.577
But I guess
he's in the picture, isn't he?

51:19.677 --> 51:20.745
But you know what?

51:20.845 --> 51:22.347
Now we're gonna
do things my way.

51:23.548 --> 51:26.484
You got Pacino for Michael.
I get Jimmy Caan for Sonny.

51:26.584 --> 51:28.353
Not a problem.

51:28.453 --> 51:30.221
I already set
Carmine Carridi.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.823
Well, then you
fucking unset him!

51:35.893 --> 51:38.696
Ah, f--

51:42.300 --> 51:43.634
I'm not gonna do that.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.236
Fucking Francis.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.837
Caan's not gonna hurt
the movie.

51:46.937 --> 51:48.506
Okay, so he's not Carridi.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.675
You begged me
for Brando and Pacino,

51:50.775 --> 51:52.543
and I delivered 'em!

51:54.845 --> 51:57.315
Take the fucking win, man.

51:57.415 --> 52:01.219
Give Bob his dignity,
and let's move on.

52:04.855 --> 52:06.457
Pacino's approved?

52:06.557 --> 52:08.125
Yes.

52:10.528 --> 52:12.563
Invite him to P.J. Clarke's.
We'll tell him in person.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.565
Thank you.
Yeah.

52:18.736 --> 52:23.308
Al, why don't you go
tell Pacino the good news.

52:23.408 --> 52:24.675
I can't. I have to go prep.

52:24.775 --> 52:26.611
I have too much I have to do.

52:26.711 --> 52:29.614
But, hey,

52:29.714 --> 52:33.651
I want to call Bob, and
I'll tell him that Caan is in.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.755
Good.

52:37.855 --> 52:40.491
Al, thanks.

52:40.591 --> 52:42.493
We're good.

52:46.964 --> 52:50.201
Scotch, neat.

52:50.301 --> 52:53.371
Sorry I'm late, gang.
You didn't tell him, did you?

52:53.471 --> 52:55.373
No, scout's honor.
Tell me what?

52:55.473 --> 52:56.907
Um, Francis
wanted to be here,

52:57.007 --> 52:58.676
but he's deep into prep.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.313
It's official.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.181
You're Michael Corleone.

53:04.282 --> 53:06.284
You got the part, kid.

53:06.384 --> 53:08.819
Evans approved you.
You're opposite Marlon Brando.

53:15.460 --> 53:17.795
What?

53:17.895 --> 53:20.331
What's going on?

53:20.431 --> 53:23.968
I was told Paramount
would never approve me.

53:24.068 --> 53:25.936
They called me a shrimp,
these guys, right?

53:26.036 --> 53:29.640
No. No.

53:29.740 --> 53:31.576
Al...

53:31.676 --> 53:33.711
I'm doing "The Gang That
Couldn't Shoot Straight"

53:33.811 --> 53:35.313
for MGM.

53:35.413 --> 53:37.682
That's a comedy.

53:37.782 --> 53:40.485
Al, you're a serious actor.

53:40.585 --> 53:44.322
Michael Corleone
is the part of a lifetime.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.625
I signed a contract.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.365
I am truly sorry.

53:54.465 --> 53:57.602
You know how badly I want
to do this with you, Francis...

53:59.704 --> 54:01.606
Good luck to you.

54:12.917 --> 54:15.453
We'll figure something out
for Michael.

54:15.553 --> 54:17.855
And Evans will get over it.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.690
You didn't hear him
on the phone.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.392
He sounded pretty pissed.

54:21.492 --> 54:25.530
Why'd you do it?

54:25.630 --> 54:29.300
Because Francis
needed Pacino.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.702
And I can't lose Francis.

54:31.802 --> 54:33.704
If I lose Francis,
I lose the movie.

54:33.804 --> 54:38.309
And at this point,
that's all I have left.

54:38.409 --> 54:39.577
At least no one can say
you don't have

54:39.677 --> 54:41.779
a whopping pair
of balls on you.

54:44.148 --> 54:47.385
No, but they can say
I don't have brains.

54:47.485 --> 54:49.354
I mean,
Evans took a chance on me

54:49.454 --> 54:51.422
when no one else would.

54:51.522 --> 54:53.858
And now that trust is gone.

54:53.958 --> 54:56.927
My relationship's done.

54:57.027 --> 54:58.429
For what?

55:01.566 --> 55:04.469
You're looking at this
the wrong way.

55:04.569 --> 55:07.805
The question you should be
asking yourself...

55:07.905 --> 55:10.641
is, why are we here,

55:10.741 --> 55:13.611
in show business?

55:13.711 --> 55:15.913
We're here
because this is the life

55:16.013 --> 55:18.315
that we've chosen, right?

55:18.416 --> 55:22.319
You, me, Bettye,
Francis, and Evans,

55:22.420 --> 55:23.621
we all ran away from home

55:23.721 --> 55:25.856
so that we could join
the circus,

55:25.956 --> 55:27.758
and everything that we say
to make it seem like

55:27.858 --> 55:29.960
we care about the life
that we could've had--

55:30.060 --> 55:34.399
wife, kids, house, dog--
it's bullshit.

55:34.499 --> 55:36.401
'Cause what's really
making you miserable

55:36.501 --> 55:37.768
isn't the fact that
you don't have a membership

55:37.868 --> 55:39.103
at the country club

55:39.203 --> 55:41.038
or the head of a 12-point buck
on your mantlepiece.

55:41.138 --> 55:43.107
None of that matters.

55:43.207 --> 55:44.975
What you really want in life,

55:45.075 --> 55:48.413
in fact, all you want in life,

55:48.513 --> 55:51.416
is just for a man
named Al Pacino

55:51.516 --> 55:54.852
to pretend he's a man
named Michael Corleone.

55:54.952 --> 55:59.857
And you're right
to be miserable over this.

55:59.957 --> 56:02.593
It is that important.

56:02.693 --> 56:05.463
'Cause I feel the same way.

56:05.563 --> 56:07.898
And we can only be around
other people

56:07.998 --> 56:10.901
who understand that.

56:11.001 --> 56:13.604
Everyone else
is just a civilian.

59:13.851 --> 59:15.052
I'm gonna make you an offer.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.021
We'll have to talk about that.
We'll take it.

59:18.956 --> 59:21.091
We're done.
Get the fuck out of my office.

59:21.826 --> 59:22.927
How did it go with Evans?

59:24.128 --> 59:25.229
I need your help.
Boy, did you come
to the wrong place.

59:25.329 --> 59:26.330
So not well?

59:27.231 --> 59:28.098
Making movies has become
too unpredictable.

59:28.766 --> 59:29.033
We've got a problem,

59:29.867 --> 59:30.868
he signed a contract
for another movie.

59:31.669 --> 59:33.604
Can't I just have
one good moment?

59:33.871 --> 59:34.705
FBI!

59:34.805 --> 59:36.774
I got plenty of friends
who wouldn't mind

59:36.874 --> 59:37.842
taking a shot at you.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.577
If you let us put a wire
on you, we can protect you.

59:40.678 --> 59:41.545
Al, this is really scary.

59:41.646 --> 59:43.580
You did the right thing
by coming here.

59:43.681 --> 59:45.182
We are still
making the movie

59:45.282 --> 59:46.617
that we all set out to make.

59:46.717 --> 59:48.085
What's right here
is what's important.

59:49.319 --> 59:51.121
Family.
Salute!

1:00:05.069 --> 1:00:06.871
I have something
you need to see.

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:07.838
What?

1:00:08.773 --> 1:00:09.139
The Coppola family
goes to Coney Island?

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:10.641
I promise you it's important.

1:00:11.575 --> 1:00:12.176
Yeah, well make an
appointment, Francis.

1:00:12.910 --> 1:00:14.044
Charlie,
what I have to show you,

1:00:14.912 --> 1:00:16.113
it's the difference
between a good movie

1:00:16.213 --> 1:00:17.948
and a cinematic classic.

1:00:18.382 --> 1:00:19.717
You gotta see it.

1:00:21.051 --> 1:00:22.186
Look at those eyes.

1:00:23.187 --> 1:00:24.121
Is that Brando?

1:00:24.955 --> 1:00:26.256
It's fucking magic.
I love it.

1:00:26.356 --> 1:00:27.324
I love it!

1:00:27.758 --> 1:00:28.959
How do you play Marlon Brando?

1:00:29.059 --> 1:00:31.161
He was the greatest
actor of his generation.

1:00:43.774 --> 1:00:45.642
From the moment
that Justin Chambers

1:00:45.910 --> 1:00:48.112
went and sat down
as Marlon Brando,

1:00:48.212 --> 1:00:49.313
he just rocked it out.

1:00:50.347 --> 1:00:52.082
Thank you for allowing me
to come into your life.

1:00:53.718 --> 1:00:54.885
You're Marlon Brando.

1:00:55.152 --> 1:00:57.922
The biggest challenge
I think for Justin,

1:00:58.022 --> 1:01:01.859
was not to do an
imitation of Brando,

1:01:02.292 --> 1:01:03.794
and he doesn't.

1:01:04.194 --> 1:01:05.162
He's Brando.

1:01:05.262 --> 1:01:06.230
He's amazing.

1:01:07.998 --> 1:01:10.100
They call me burned-out Brando.

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:12.770
I haven't heard that.

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:16.006
I don't know who "they" is,
but they're morons.

1:01:16.106 --> 1:01:19.977
He was quite open about wanting
to honor the two legends

1:01:20.077 --> 1:01:22.947
that he was taking on,
this legendary performance,

1:01:23.047 --> 1:01:26.216
and the legendary actor
that was responsible for it.

1:01:26.450 --> 1:01:28.919
You'd like to know
my motivation for...

1:01:29.019 --> 1:01:30.755
for being here and
sitting with you?

1:01:31.421 --> 1:01:35.025
Because he knew
that I was
an actor as well as a director,

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:37.928
I think he trusted
my appreciation

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:41.698
of how intimidating what
he was taking on was.

1:01:46.070 --> 1:01:47.071
I see you.

1:01:47.304 --> 1:01:48.939
I'm sort of hiding

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:50.207
and he clocks me

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:52.777
and says, "I see you.
Come in and sit down."

1:01:53.077 --> 1:01:54.044
Come on.

1:01:55.946 --> 1:01:59.083
It was uncanny, how much
he looked like Brando.

1:01:59.183 --> 1:02:02.086
And then the way he held a room

1:02:02.419 --> 1:02:04.721
with the pauses and with
the volume of his voice

1:02:04.822 --> 1:02:07.257
and the power that he
managed to portray.

1:02:07.357 --> 1:02:10.394
Ever since your letter,
I keep thinking about the Don.

1:02:10.494 --> 1:02:12.997
It's-- It's all I see anymore.

1:02:13.964 --> 1:02:15.866
In Justin's case,
it really was like

1:02:15.966 --> 1:02:17.868
a double transformation
he had to make,

1:02:17.968 --> 1:02:21.305
because he had to take
on becoming Brando,

1:02:21.405 --> 1:02:25.843
and then as Brando, transform
himself into Vito Corleone.

1:02:25.943 --> 1:02:28.278
Maybe the Don got
shot in the throat,

1:02:28.979 --> 1:02:31.882
which uh, which
affected his voice.

1:02:32.382 --> 1:02:35.853
Both of those things he does,
I think, quite masterfully.

1:02:38.022 --> 1:02:41.425
I'm very happy with how
the scene in which he transforms

1:02:41.525 --> 1:02:43.193
into the Don turned out.

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:45.529
And we did it very
impressionistically.

1:02:45.629 --> 1:02:48.298
We just showed glimpses,

1:02:48.933 --> 1:02:51.201
so that this transformation
was something

1:02:51.301 --> 1:02:54.271
that we almost felt
before we saw it.

1:02:54.471 --> 1:02:56.473
Bonasera, Bonasera...

1:02:56.974 --> 1:02:58.042
There's something
very empowering

1:02:58.142 --> 1:02:59.944
about an actor to
be doing something

1:03:00.044 --> 1:03:02.346
and then see the characters
that you're working with

1:03:02.446 --> 1:03:03.948
impressed by that.

1:03:05.149 --> 1:03:07.051
It sort of reflects your own
power back to you in a way.

1:03:07.351 --> 1:03:09.854
That was a pretty
spectacular thing
to be a part of.

1:03:09.954 --> 1:03:12.923
I knew that the effect
was gonna be magical

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:14.091
on the other cast members.

1:03:15.059 --> 1:03:17.094
They were all in awe of
what Justin was doing.

1:03:17.394 --> 1:03:19.063
And cut!
Beautiful.

1:03:19.163 --> 1:03:20.397
I thought he was extraordinary.

1:03:20.497 --> 1:03:24.168
Tissue paper and shoe polish
and Brando disappears.

1:03:24.268 --> 1:03:26.003
He's a genius.

1:03:26.103 --> 1:03:28.405
So does Justin Chambers
pretend to be Brando?

1:03:28.505 --> 1:03:29.439
Yeah, we all do.

1:03:30.274 --> 1:03:30.875
They're actors,
yes, they pretend.

1:03:31.876 --> 1:03:33.878
But his performance really
has all the subtleties

1:03:33.978 --> 1:03:35.913
of a man who has
a deep inner life

1:03:36.013 --> 1:03:37.814
and a deep inner monologue

1:03:37.915 --> 1:03:39.884
that's constantly,
constantly running.

1:03:39.984 --> 1:03:40.885
That was incredible.
Yeah.

1:03:40.985 --> 1:03:42.252
My God, what an actor.

1:03:42.352 --> 1:03:45.990
It's like...
...magic every day.

1:03:46.090 --> 1:03:48.893
Now we got a shot at making
the real thing here, folks.
