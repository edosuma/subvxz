MAIN TITLE

02:09.378 --> 02:11.089
Welcome back to the fight, Paladins.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.507
It's good to be back.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.134
You know, in our bodies.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.511
MFE pilots, what's your status?

02:16.886 --> 02:17.846
Power is dropping.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.224
- Return to the Atlas and recharge.
- Copy that. We're on our way.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.528
The manifold in the left flaxum assembly
felt loose.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.113
See if you can tighten that down.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.449
All right, let's get this fighter charged
and ready to go.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.165
Lieutenant Hepta is not responding.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.917
Then you are now acting lieutenant.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.460
Status report.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.172
The cannons are fully charged
and moving into position.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.550
They should be ready to fire
in 15 doboshes.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.887
However, if the enemy ship continues
to pursue us into the upper atmosphere,

02:58.970 --> 03:00.263
that could cause a problem.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.807
Focus the entirety
of the fleet's firepower

03:02.891 --> 03:04.726
on Voltron and their new ship.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.103
Keep them occupied as long as possible.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.310
Form sword!

04:09.999 --> 04:13.461
Coran, adjust our heading to narrow
our surface area for incoming attacks.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.589
Commander Holt, what's the status
of the Zaiforge cannons?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.093
According to their projected trajectories,
they've started moving together,

04:20.176 --> 04:21.636
but their convergent point is...

04:23.137 --> 04:23.972
Sam?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.266
Sam? What is it?

04:26.557 --> 04:28.059
I know what Sendak is doing.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.769
He's going to converge the beams

04:29.852 --> 04:32.939
to make one massive amplified emission
of particle radiation.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.899
Is that even possible?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.695
Yes. I know because I gave them
the technology.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.113
When I was enslaved,

04:40.196 --> 04:43.283
the Galra had me working
on particle emission amplification.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.452
I'm sending you
the Zaiforge cannons' movements.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.580
This is a simulation I've run
based on their current trajectory.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.582
It leads to a single point in space.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.418
Once they're in position,

04:53.501 --> 04:55.545
their individual beams
will merge together,

04:55.628 --> 04:58.172
exponentially increasing
their destructive force.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.802
It will be powerful enough
to completely vaporize Earth.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.222
We can't let that happen. What do we do?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.308
Should we go after the Zaiforge cannons?

05:08.391 --> 05:10.810
The Lions might not be able
to defeat them all in time.

05:10.893 --> 05:15.273
If even two of those beams connect,
they have the power to destroy Earth.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.650
We know they're being controlled
by Sendak.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.860
Let's take him out.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.874
What the heck was that?

05:55.313 --> 05:58.274
We're under attack from one of those bases
that launched a Zaiforge cannon!

05:58.483 --> 06:01.194
They must have been designed
to defend the cannons after they launched.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.111
Shield!

06:09.494 --> 06:12.038
- We're being attacked from all angles.
- Should we fall back?

06:12.246 --> 06:13.998
No, we're too close to retreat.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.251
We can't take any more shots
from those ground-based cannons.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.795
Get in close to the cruisers.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.463
They won't fire on their own ships.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.060
Sendak's destroying his own ships
to get to us.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.199
Commander, Zaiforge cannons
are nearing final position.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.085
We can't get to Sendak!

06:59.418 --> 07:00.711
Voltron is pinned down!

07:01.045 --> 07:02.505
Griffin, what's your team's status?

07:03.381 --> 07:04.924
The MFEs are nearly charged.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.093
Whatever's powering the Atlas
is incredible.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.803
We need you back in the fight.

07:08.886 --> 07:12.598
Head to the coordinates I'm sending you
and take out those surface-to-air cannons.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.516
Yes, sir.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.087
Leifsdottir, give me a battle stratagem.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.965
We attack the base and try to destroy it
before it destroys us.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.467
Oh, I thought you might have

07:47.550 --> 07:49.802
some mathematically advanced insight
or something.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.137
Our options are limited.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.098
Well, you heard Leifsdottir. Let's move!

07:58.561 --> 08:01.147
We've sustained structural damage
on our starboard bow!

08:01.647 --> 08:05.151
Aft cannons are recharging.
Holding tight at 45 percent.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.279
Shiro, the Zaiforge cannons
are almost in position.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.657
By my calculations,
we're not going to get to Sendak in time.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.785
Paladins, you have to stop your attack.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.579
What?

08:16.662 --> 08:19.332
Abort your attack
or Earth will be destroyed.

08:21.918 --> 08:22.752
What's going on?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.171
The Atlas will continue to attack Sendak

08:25.254 --> 08:27.548
while the MFEs attempt to take out
the ground cannons.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.091
But just in case that doesn't work,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.802
we'll need you to stop
the Zaiforge cannons directly.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.846
How are we gonna stop all these cannons?

08:33.929 --> 08:36.182
I'm not sure a Lion
can take one down on its own.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.517
We just have to think.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.936
Is there any way we can block the beams?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.729
We would be annihilated.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.191
Hey, what about those reflective plates
they used to curve the beam around Earth?

08:45.483 --> 08:48.486
They could deflect the beams
and keep them from merging.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.906
Okay. It's the best plan we've got so far.
Let's go!

08:53.449 --> 08:54.450
Good luck, Paladins.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.119
These plates are pretty far apart.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.915
I'm sending flight paths I calculated
with the fastest possible routes.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.918
Keith and Lance,
you'll take the furthest plates.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.088
After you get your plate,

09:07.171 --> 09:09.757
head to the indicated cannon
on the course I've sent you.

09:09.966 --> 09:10.800
Got it.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.642
Okay, we're going to strafe and burn.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.894
- Watch for crossfire and--
- Destroy that base!

09:21.978 --> 09:23.563
And she's already engaging.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.523
Everyone, follow Rizavi.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.327
The base is highly fortified.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.163
It's most vulnerable after it fires.
That's when we attack.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.306
Atlas, cannon one is neutralized.
Moving on to next target.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.143
We have a fire in the plasma alternator.
Activating fire suppressors.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.854
Veronica, what's the status
of the shielding system?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.188
I'm trying.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.398
Keep working.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.735
Coran, adjust our heading to 5.38.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.431
Come on, come on...

10:41.474 --> 10:44.977
- How much time do we have?
- Two minutes, 15 seconds and counting.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.441
It's gonna be tight!

11:00.534 --> 11:02.370
Full ordinance! Starboard side!

11:02.453 --> 11:03.663
Munitions to starboard.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.251
Coran, bearings: 7.2.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.339
Fire!

11:19.011 --> 11:20.679
Galra cruiser destroyed!

11:21.472 --> 11:24.600
More cruisers incoming.
We can't handle many more blasts.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.312
- Wait, the shielding system...
- What is it?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.272
It's coming online!

11:35.945 --> 11:37.405
Shielding successful!

11:38.239 --> 11:40.324
How much time
before the Zaiforge cannons fire?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.326
Any second now!

11:47.623 --> 11:48.958
We're almost in position.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.588
Fire.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.394
The Lions have the plates in position,

12:08.477 --> 12:11.480
but those plates were designed
to reflect a short burst.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.775
They won't hold for long
under the pressure of a sustained blast.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.777
Then we need to take out Sendak now.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.780
But we can't get through
the cruiser blockade he's created.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.326
We need a new plan.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.955
Sam, what if someone
were to infiltrate Sendak's ship

12:28.038 --> 12:29.373
and gain access to its crystal?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.875
Could the cannons be disrupted?

12:31.208 --> 12:33.919
-  Infiltrate Sendak's ship?
- Would it work?

12:34.503 --> 12:36.839
It could work, but you'd need
a communication device

12:36.922 --> 12:38.841
to link to the Atlas
so we can hack their system.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.510
Then that's what we'll do. I'm going in.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.722
Coran, the ship is yours.
Get the Atlas to the impact site.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.682
We need to be prepared for every outcome.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.143
Commander, they're deflecting the beams.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.936
Keep firing!

13:30.476 --> 13:33.354
They're gonna rupture soon!
We don't have much longer!

13:38.984 --> 13:41.737
Keep holding, team. We can do this!

13:42.530 --> 13:43.656
Atlas, what's happening?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.575
Hold a little longer! We have a plan!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.662
Whatever it is, we're running out of time!

13:53.624 --> 13:56.210
Atlas, I've arrived
at Sendak's command ship.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.162
We've intercepted the beam,
but we need more power!

14:43.799 --> 14:45.467
Leifsdottir, draw their fire!

14:46.552 --> 14:47.761
Let's finish this.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.198
Paladins! Paladins, are you there?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.160
Shiro, I can't reach the Paladins

15:11.243 --> 15:13.704
and the Atlas can't hold this beam
much longer!

15:13.787 --> 15:15.789
Whatever you're gonna do,
can you do it now?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.881
Sam, I've made it to the crystal.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.008
Activating communication transponder.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.304
Okay, Shiro. I have to warn you,
this might be a little strange.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.057
I'm about to use your brain
as a computer node.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.225
Well, wouldn't be the first time.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.830
I've got it! Disengaging the ventral
thoron injector port.

15:57.456 --> 16:01.335
It will overload the deuterium array,
which should result in an explosion

16:01.418 --> 16:03.671
large enough to debilitate
the beam generator.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.777
I've lost my connection. Shiro?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.197
Shiro? Shiro, are you there?

16:30.739 --> 16:33.659
Shiro? Shiro!

16:38.539 --> 16:39.915
One of the cannons is down.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.835
That just bought us time,
but we still can't withstand the blast

16:42.918 --> 16:44.586
from the other cannons much longer.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.883
We've lost a cannon.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.760
What happened to our power?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.014
The crystal has been damaged.
The ship cannot maintain altitude.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.267
It's listing toward their planet.
We need to evacuate.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.769
Victory or death, Lieutenant.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.027
The shield is failing!
Twenty-four percent and dropping!

17:08.318 --> 17:10.570
I'm diverting power
from the infinite mass crystal.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.659
Paladins, hurry!

17:16.410 --> 17:17.243
Lance!

17:23.791 --> 17:24.626
Oh, no.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.729
Lance...

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
Hang on. I'm coming to help.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.159
What?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.788
The Lions have defeated
all of the cannons.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.581
Atlas, this is Griffin.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.501
MFEs have successfully neutralized
our final target.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.587
The only remaining hostile
is Sendak's ship.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.925
It's free-falling towards Earth's surface.
It's already hit terminal velocity.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.802
Shiro's still in there.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.281
You!

19:50.939 --> 19:52.941
Sendak's ship is gonna crash into Earth!

19:53.317 --> 19:56.320
We have to guide it
to an uninhabited area. Follow me!

20:25.849 --> 20:27.768
Every ounce of my being

20:27.851 --> 20:32.356
will be directed toward the destruction
of you and your pathetic planet!

20:54.753 --> 20:55.963
Hold it together.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.756
We gotta make it past the city.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.220
Victory...

21:46.305 --> 21:47.472
or death.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.041
Thank you.

22:25.093 --> 22:25.927
We did it!

22:26.553 --> 22:27.637
Earth is safe!
