AWFUL THING I THINK YOU CAN DO

27:35.987 --> 27:40.458
YOUR LIFE LIKE TO HAVE MOMENTS

27:40.525 --> 27:40.825
LIKE THIS OR...

27:40.892 --> 27:41.826

27:49.434 --> 27:51.302
THAT COMES OVER YOU, THE

27:51.369 --> 27:52.637
CALMNESS.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.738
IT'S SUCH A RELAXED VERSION OF

27:53.805 --> 27:55.173
YOU.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.908
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN ALL DAY.

27:56.975 --> 28:02.614
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.248
HOW DO YOU, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:03.314 --> 28:06.451
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.585
I -- NO COMMENTS.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.888
I HAVE TO PROCESS ALL OF THIS.

28:09.954 --> 28:10.688
>> Eureka: IT'S OKAY.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.657
>> THAT'S OKAY.

28:12.724 --> 28:13.358

28:15.927 --> 28:18.163
YEAH, IT'S A LOT.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.831
>> YEAH.

28:19.898 --> 28:20.465

28:20.532 --> 28:21.232
JOSH THIS WAY; I'VE NEVER SEEN

28:21.299 --> 28:24.502
THIS SIDE OF HIM.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.171
BUT I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO

28:26.237 --> 28:30.075
LOOK IN A MIRROR AND BE LIKE

28:30.141 --> 28:31.076
"HEY, THIS IS GREAT, I LOVE ME."

28:31.142 --> 28:33.211
SO IF THIS GETS HIM JUST EVEN

28:33.278 --> 28:34.379
THE TINIEST STEP TOWARDS HIM

28:34.446 --> 28:35.880
ACCEPTING HIMSELF LIKE THAT

28:35.947 --> 28:36.915
WOULD JUST MAKE SUCH A

28:36.981 --> 28:44.956
DIFFERENCE.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.658

29:23.128 --> 29:24.596
>> A LITTLE BIT.

29:24.662 --> 29:25.663
I'M HOPING I DON'T DEAL WITH ANY

29:25.730 --> 29:26.664
BULL, I DEALT WITH A TINY BIT OF

29:26.731 --> 29:28.166
BULLSHIT ALREADY WHICH WAS

MILDLY DISAPPOINTING, KEEP AN

29:28.967 --> 29:29.601
EYE ON YOUR BOBBER.

29:51.022 --> 29:51.990
SPEECH.

29:52.056 --> 29:53.091
>> Shangela: SO I WOULD PREFER

29:53.158 --> 29:54.292
IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST SAY N

29:54.359 --> 29:54.726
WORD.

29:54.792 --> 29:55.760
>> I DON'T THINK THAT MAKING

29:55.827 --> 29:56.294
WORDS AGAINST THE RULES IS

29:56.361 --> 29:56.895
HELPFUL AT ALL.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.129
IT JUST GIVES THOSE WORDS MORE

29:58.196 --> 29:59.564
POWER IN MY OPINION.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.398
>> Shangela: IT CAN BUT IT

30:00.465 --> 30:01.399
DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAY THAT IT

30:01.466 --> 30:02.467

LIKE...

30:12.911 --> 30:13.444

30:13.511 --> 30:14.279
THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THAT

30:14.345 --> 30:15.246
SHIT OFFENDS ME AND IT, IT

30:15.313 --> 30:16.548
OFFENDS ME EVEN MORE THAT YOU

30:16.614 --> 30:17.782

30:17.849 --> 30:19.517
SOMETHING FOUL LIKE THAT

30:19.584 --> 30:21.085
THINKING THAT I'M GOING TO AGREE

30:21.152 --> 30:22.420
WITH YOU JUST BECAUSE LIKE YOU

30:22.487 --> 30:24.122
THINK I LOOK LIKE YOU OR
