00:21.655 --> 00:23.956
(thunder crashes)

00:35.403 --> 00:37.269
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

00:43.878 --> 00:46.979
(bluegrass music playing,
people talking and laughing)

00:46.981 --> 00:50.649
¶ ¶

00:50.651 --> 00:53.185
(chatter, laughter continue)

00:53.187 --> 00:55.387
(man whooping)

00:56.891 --> 00:58.957
(thunder rumbling)

01:07.034 --> 01:09.101
(conversation quiets)

01:09.103 --> 01:10.436
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:10.438 --> 01:14.106
The time has come
for us to bid farewell.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.042
But not before we toast
the new owner

01:17.044 --> 01:18.410
Of the show, chester.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.912
Man:
To chester.

01:19.914 --> 01:23.082
(light applause)
elsa: I hope he will cherish

01:23.084 --> 01:25.617
These magnificent monsters
as much as i have

01:25.619 --> 01:27.519
Over these many years.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.921
Cheers.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.956
Others: Cheers.
All right!

01:30.958 --> 01:32.291
(sighs)

01:32.293 --> 01:35.194
Um... Miss elsa,
you have given me

01:35.196 --> 01:37.129
The dream of a lifetime.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.964
I promise to uphold

01:38.966 --> 01:40.933
The standards
of this extravaganza

01:40.935 --> 01:43.068
And do you proud.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.037
Safe travels
to the land of make-believe.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.139
(chuckles)
good riddance.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.374
I can't wait
for the sour<i> kraut</i>

01:49.376 --> 01:51.110
To leave,
so we can take over.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.078
Marjorie, that's not...

01:53.080 --> 01:54.913
(laughter, snickering)

01:54.915 --> 01:56.148
Thank you, chester.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.884
And now, if you don't mind,
it's time

01:58.886 --> 02:00.953
For the original family--
our troupe

02:00.955 --> 02:03.055
Of monsters and curiosities--

02:03.057 --> 02:07.092
To spend these last few moments
alone together.

02:07.094 --> 02:10.095
Oh... Oh, sure... All right.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.130
Bye-bye.
Bye.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.631
Bye.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.007
We have another man to thank--
my manager,

02:22.009 --> 02:24.042
Mr. Richard spencer.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.514
Elsa:
He has transformed the course

02:28.516 --> 02:31.150
Of all our lives.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.118
Cheers!

02:33.120 --> 02:35.020
Others: Cheers! Hear, hear!
Stanley:
Hey, thank you, thank you.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.288
Mm!

02:36.290 --> 02:38.157
Because of him...

02:38.159 --> 02:40.325
You will all be on television

02:40.327 --> 02:41.693
Very soon,

02:41.695 --> 02:43.095
On<i> the elsa</i>
<i>mars hour.</i>

02:43.097 --> 02:44.963
But first, tonight,

02:44.965 --> 02:46.598
We feast,

02:46.600 --> 02:49.434
And later, for entertainment,
we will watch a movie

02:49.436 --> 02:51.637
From my own collection.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.372
Not<i> the sign of the cross</i> again!

02:53.374 --> 02:55.374
(thunder crashes)
(laughs): No.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.009
We will enjoy<i> freaks.</i>

02:57.011 --> 02:59.144
Do you know that picture,
richard?
Uh...

02:59.146 --> 03:01.780
I can't say that i do.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.982
Oh, it's a wonderful picture.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.151
Explain the plot to him,
eve, paul.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.287
Amazon eve:
Well, the film is set

03:08.289 --> 03:10.189
In a traveling circus--
a freak show.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.190
Ah.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.457
Paul:
Cleopatra,

03:12.459 --> 03:13.559
A "normal" trapeze artist,

03:13.561 --> 03:14.860
Marries the sideshow midget.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.061
But actually,

03:16.063 --> 03:17.329
She's trying to poison him

03:17.331 --> 03:19.364
For his inheritance.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.334
Paul: She plays all the freaks
for fools until, one day,

03:22.336 --> 03:24.836
She gets drunk
and reveals her true intentions.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.138
Amazon eve:
Then the freaks

03:26.140 --> 03:27.472
Turn on her.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.374
They take their revenge out
at night

03:29.376 --> 03:32.077
With knives and guns.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.178
Elsa:
Eve, eve.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.680
Darling...

03:34.682 --> 03:37.382
Don't spoil the ending for him.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.152
Well, it sounds
like a hit!

03:40.154 --> 03:42.554
(thunder crashes, rumbles)
(laughter)

03:43.557 --> 03:46.225
Ah... Actually,

03:46.227 --> 03:48.493
I have to go.

03:48.495 --> 03:52.764
So many things to do
before we head out west.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.833
Nonsense. Oh, no.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.869
You can't leave
before your present.
No,

03:57.871 --> 03:59.238
I couldn't.
Maggie: Shut up and sit down.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.840
You deserve this.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.075
(thunder crashes)

04:03.077 --> 04:05.444
What's gotten into you?

04:14.888 --> 04:17.756
Come on, richard,
open it.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.334
I thought about you
long and hard when i made this.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.044
Oh, thank goodness.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.812
Well, we have had
our share of patrons

04:40.814 --> 04:43.649
Who felt lightheaded
at the sight of our
exhibits, but...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.317
We have never
had anyone

04:45.319 --> 04:46.451
Faint before.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.120
Are you all right,
young lady?

04:48.122 --> 04:51.323
Desiree: What happened
to those security guards?

04:51.325 --> 04:53.325
Well, it's past closing.
I... I sent them home.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.394
Desiree: That's
good to know.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.232
Now it's your turn.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.234
Jesus christ.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.472
Oh. I'm innocent.
I-i-i...

05:07.474 --> 05:09.274
I don't even know
who this is.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.742
I already told them
everything...

05:10.744 --> 05:12.177
Stanley.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.317
Elsa...

05:18.319 --> 05:20.085
(chuckling):
Come on...

05:20.087 --> 05:22.087
Talk to them.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.488
What about... What about

05:23.490 --> 05:26.091
Uh, your... The dream?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.359
Hollywood!

05:27.361 --> 05:29.795
I'm afraid...

05:29.797 --> 05:32.364
That's all it is.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.333
(whispers):
Just a dream.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.502
(stanley yells)

05:37.504 --> 05:38.603
Elsa:
Go ahead,

05:38.605 --> 05:40.339
Spin him.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.542
Aah! Jesus...

05:44.445 --> 05:45.444
No.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.945
(grunts)

05:46.947 --> 05:48.680
Stanley:
Please.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.949
I may not have been
completely truthful, but...

05:50.951 --> 05:52.984
I do know people in los angeles.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.320
My cousin works
at the garden of allah.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.023
Please...
You tried to kill my dreams,

05:58.025 --> 06:00.525
But they cannot be murdered.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.197
(thunder crashing)
but you did...

06:05.199 --> 06:07.499
(seething breath)

06:07.501 --> 06:10.535
...You brought death
into this place...

06:10.537 --> 06:12.704
And for that...

06:12.706 --> 06:14.339
You must pay.

06:14.341 --> 06:17.209
Take him down.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.910
Elsa:
Hurry, hurry.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.313
Elsa, come on, now...

06:21.315 --> 06:24.249
You and me must have a
private conversation.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.551
We can come
to some kind of understanding.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.854
(yells)

06:28.856 --> 06:29.855
So you think you can run?

06:29.857 --> 06:32.557
(gasps)

06:33.394 --> 06:35.827
She... Killed...

06:35.829 --> 06:36.895
Ethel.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.366
I'm telling the truth.
She killed her.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.435
I helped her cover it up.
She's...
Elsa: Will you, mr. Spencer...

06:43.437 --> 06:44.870
She's not who you think she is!

06:44.872 --> 06:46.338
Stop talking,
she killed ethel!

06:46.340 --> 06:47.572
And start running.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.840
(thunder crashing)

06:48.842 --> 06:51.410
Run! Run!

06:51.412 --> 06:53.111
Run!

06:55.416 --> 06:57.649
(gasping, muttering)

06:58.385 --> 06:59.451
(yells)

07:12.966 --> 07:14.633
(thunder crashing)

07:20.908 --> 07:22.507
(moaning)

07:24.111 --> 07:25.343
(yells)

07:26.246 --> 07:27.379
(gasping)

07:31.285 --> 07:34.786
(screaming)

08:44.491 --> 08:47.559
Elsa:
<i>Just because you were raised</i>
<i>without a father</i>

08:47.561 --> 08:49.528
Doesn't mean
you get to romanticize him

08:49.530 --> 08:50.462
Now that he's gone.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.897
How did he die?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.532
Who killed him?

08:56.303 --> 08:57.302
We all did.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.703
He broke our code.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.473
He had it coming.
That's all you need to know.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.608
Now, here.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.546
Eat some food.
You need your strength.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.647
Come on.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.549
(coughs) he was my father!

09:10.551 --> 09:11.550
He killed a freak!

09:11.552 --> 09:13.385
(panting softly)

09:13.387 --> 09:16.187
The most vulnerable among us.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.156
Well, you're gonna take
her word for it?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.991
That deceitful
little slut?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.393
I saw my beloved
ma petite

09:21.395 --> 09:23.595
In a jar with my own eyes.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.197
I heard him confess
with my own ears!

09:26.199 --> 09:28.567
And as for maggie,
we'd have

09:28.569 --> 09:30.669
A lot more corpses on our hand

09:30.671 --> 09:32.737
If she hadn't come clean.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.241
I don't forgive.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.909
She can rot in hell,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.678
For all i care.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.347
Seems to me like
you need all the friends

09:42.349 --> 09:44.549
You can get right now.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.418
Maggie is going
to change your bandages.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.419
No!

09:47.421 --> 09:48.787
I'll keep the dirty ones.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.922
You will not!
Now, your mother is not here

09:50.924 --> 09:53.124
To look after you,
so it falls to me.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.561
I have seen you grow
from a boy to a man,

09:56.563 --> 09:59.631
A man to a leader--
and we need you now.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.266
I have no hands!

10:01.268 --> 10:04.436
I can't even take a piss
by myself!

10:04.438 --> 10:06.271
I have found a old friend.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.373
He's coming to help you.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.941
He's a true artist.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.643
Darling, he'll
make you new hands,

10:11.645 --> 10:13.244
A fresh start.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.080
But those wounds
have to heal first.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.449
Maggie's going
to help you.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.683
You let her.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.372
(gasps, groans quietly)

10:42.976 --> 10:44.709
(sighs)

10:47.481 --> 10:48.480
(exhales)

10:48.482 --> 10:50.582
(hissing inhale, groan)

10:50.584 --> 10:52.183
(trembling breath)

10:52.185 --> 10:53.351
(groans)

10:55.322 --> 10:56.921
(jimmy inhales, pants)

11:04.498 --> 11:06.031
(screaming)

11:06.033 --> 11:08.333
(grunts, screams)

11:09.770 --> 11:11.369
(jimmy grunts, groans)

11:13.640 --> 11:15.674
(coughing)

11:15.676 --> 11:17.709
(panting)
i'm sorry.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.711
I hate hurting you.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.546
(groaning)

11:21.548 --> 11:23.048
(panting)

11:23.050 --> 11:24.616
Oh, really?

11:24.618 --> 11:26.317
(panting)

11:26.319 --> 11:28.119
I thought that was
your whole gig--

11:28.121 --> 11:29.688
To hurt people.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.558
I love you, jimmy.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.694
That part is real.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.029
It always was.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.964
I want a clean start.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.904
We can still go to new york,
like we planned.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.105
Why not?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.642
You're kidding, right?

11:50.644 --> 11:53.178
You think,
after everything you've done,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.080
You think we're just gonna
ride off into the sunset?

11:55.082 --> 11:56.581
My hands...

11:56.583 --> 11:58.149
Are in a goddamn jar,

11:58.151 --> 11:59.651
And that's all because of you.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.587
I am so sorry.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.923
I'm gonna make
it right with you

12:04.925 --> 12:07.859
And with them... I promise.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.161
You're gonna bring ma petite
back from the dead?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.863
Hmm?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.865
I've changed, jimmy.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.367
If i was you...

12:16.369 --> 12:20.739
I'd get the hell out of dodge
before i get those new hands.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.773
I'm gonna make things right--

12:21.775 --> 12:23.742
With them and with you!

12:26.847 --> 12:29.180
(inhales deeply)

12:32.953 --> 12:33.952
Ach!

12:33.954 --> 12:36.087
I knew you were stupid,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.957
But let's add blind
to the list, huh?

12:38.959 --> 12:42.293
Find me someone
who can focus a lamp!

12:42.295 --> 12:44.763
I have to stick around here.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.231
I'm gonna have
correct lighting

12:46.233 --> 12:47.632
For the first time,
you understand?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.901
Now, try it again!

12:49.903 --> 12:52.003
<i>Scheisse!</i>

13:26.339 --> 13:28.006
Elsa.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.250
Oh. You came.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.286
Of course.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.087
(insects chirping)

13:43.089 --> 13:46.191
¶ that comes
with every memory... ¶

13:46.193 --> 13:49.360
(moaning, gasping passionately)

13:49.362 --> 13:53.832
¶ and try to find the perfect
prayer that will convey ¶

13:53.834 --> 13:57.836
¶ a dream from me to you... ¶

13:57.838 --> 14:00.104
She's watching us.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.711
Dot:
Can we put her away?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.847
Just this once?
(chester mutters)

14:08.849 --> 14:10.515
Please?

14:14.054 --> 14:17.222
All right.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.691
Yeah.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.859
Mm.
Bette:
Oh.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.228
Thank you, chester.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.396
(all moaning)

14:25.398 --> 14:26.798
¶ i reminisce
with heartache... ¶

14:26.800 --> 14:30.802
(moaning passionately)

14:30.804 --> 14:33.338
¶ that comes
with every daybreak... ¶

14:33.340 --> 14:34.839
Marjorie:
<i>You put me on the floor.</i>

14:34.841 --> 14:36.808
<i>Like an old sock.</i>

14:36.810 --> 14:39.510
I'm sorry, marjorie.
I... I knew you'd get upset.

14:39.512 --> 14:43.681
I got a little... Carried away,
but i'm finally happy.

14:43.683 --> 14:48.052
I've got them
and my magic and you.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.420
Maybe i should leave.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.989
Why? Why would you do that?

14:50.991 --> 14:52.523
We'll... We can...

14:52.525 --> 14:54.425
We can work it out, marjorie.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.827
The-the twins accept you.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.862
They-they just...
They just don't

14:57.864 --> 15:00.265
Want you watching us
while we're, you know...

15:00.267 --> 15:04.002
They're using you, chester.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.236
You're the boss.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.838
No, they are not.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.840
They love me.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.742
And they are
going to cure me

15:10.744 --> 15:12.710
Of everything
that's wrong with me. They...

15:12.712 --> 15:15.747
They know the real me. I'm just
a... A regular man trying to...

15:15.749 --> 15:18.416
Trying to find love,
just like everybody else.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.952
You're a murderer.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.453
No, no.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.922
No.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.857
That's not me. That's you,

15:25.859 --> 15:26.958
Marjorie.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.860
I know you don't like

15:28.862 --> 15:31.896
To talk about it, so i don't
bring it up much, but you...

15:31.898 --> 15:34.399
Killed them.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.935
You killed alice and lucy.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.003
Marjorie:
That's impossible.

15:40.040 --> 15:40.972
I'm a doll.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.341
(gasps)

15:48.982 --> 15:51.049
(wheezing)

15:58.758 --> 16:01.926
Hmm.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.329
Love destroys you, chester.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.831
You lose control.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.067
Well, i know...

16:09.069 --> 16:11.336
I'm a monster.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.071
You don't need them.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.373
You have me.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.910
I know.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.214
(shudders)

16:24.918 --> 16:27.585
Just please
don't ever leave me, marjorie.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.420
Those twins?

16:29.422 --> 16:30.922
Uh-huh.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.957
They have to go.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.325
I know.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.861
They will.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.776
¶ well, my dad
or mother's dead... ¶

16:51.778 --> 16:55.279
(blues riff playing
on guitar)

16:55.281 --> 16:56.848
Ethel looks so glamorous

16:56.850 --> 16:59.350
In this one
with all her chorus girls.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.052
Oh, that was
from her barnum days.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.454
She really was
a dame like no other.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.123
(laughter)

17:05.125 --> 17:07.025
To ethel.
To ethel.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.193
To ethel.
Suzi:
You think elsa's
gonna stick around

17:09.195 --> 17:11.462
Now that her big hollywood
dreams have been shot to hell?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.297
Amazon eve:
She's already sold the show

17:13.299 --> 17:16.300
To chester. She's definitely not
gonna give him his money back.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.202
Yeah, she'll probably let him
think he's running things

17:18.204 --> 17:20.071
For a while, but we
all know that anyone

17:20.073 --> 17:22.306
Who gets in the way of elsa
isn't long for this world.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.209
What are you saying?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.378
Didn't any one hear what that
creep spencer said last night?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.580
It finally makes sense.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.315
Elsa killed ethel.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.817
The woods.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.085
The car crash.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.821
It was all a cover-up.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.222
I believe it.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.058
She put a knife in my paul,

17:40.060 --> 17:41.993
That crazy, vindictive woman.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.662
All elsa cares
about is elsa.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.165
The whole business never
sat right with me.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.100
I know ethel.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.002
She wasn't a one
to off herself.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.503
She wasn't a coward.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.205
She wouldn't have done that
to her kid,

17:54.207 --> 17:56.074
And she wouldn't have
done it to us.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.510
And she would have
bloody well left a note.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.847
We know what we do when people
come after one of our own.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.216
There's only one way
to secure our future.

18:05.218 --> 18:10.188
Make sure elsa doesn't have one.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.523
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

18:17.363 --> 18:19.897
Did you ever imagine

18:19.899 --> 18:22.200
That it would feel
like that, dot?

18:24.537 --> 18:27.105
And thank goodness you said
something about marjorie.

18:27.107 --> 18:31.442
To his credit, all he needed
was that little nudge.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.945
I do seriously believe
we're a good influence on him.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.581
Dandy:
Good evening girls.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.483
Dot:
What are you doing here?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.451
How dare you just walk
into our boudoir

18:40.453 --> 18:42.053
In the middle
of the night!
Yeah.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.655
I come hat in hand
in friendship.

18:44.657 --> 18:50.461
I have some relevant information
about your current... Situation.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.663
We don't want
to hear anything from you.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.232
Kindly leave.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.501
Oh, dot, i don't blame you.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.303
I behaved
like an absolute jackass

18:59.305 --> 19:01.405
That last day,
when all seemed lost.

19:01.407 --> 19:06.110
But recent events have softened
some of my coarser edges.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.279
¶ why do i love him so? ¶

19:08.281 --> 19:10.114
Mother died.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.683
It was sudden and...

19:12.685 --> 19:14.685
Just horrible.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.121
Bette:
I'm very sorry, dandy.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.024
It's a big sorrow for
anyone, losing their mother.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.192
It was.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.294
It is.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.531
And it made me realize
that i need to reach out

19:26.533 --> 19:28.533
To the few that matter to me.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.568
I think you should know,
we met a man.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.438
Truthfully,
i'd already heard the news.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.141
I can't tell you
how sublime it would have been

19:37.143 --> 19:39.143
To have taken your hands
in marriage.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.378
If i had it all
to do over again,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.613
Believe me, i...

19:42.615 --> 19:45.449
I come in friendship.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.152
I'm well aware
that i missed my chance.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.388
I'm not half the man
you deserve.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.223
¶ just forget me... ¶

19:52.225 --> 19:55.226
But i asked myself,

19:55.228 --> 19:58.162
"dandy, what could you do

19:58.164 --> 20:01.332
To be of support
to those beloved girls?"

20:01.334 --> 20:03.167
And it occurred to me,

20:03.169 --> 20:05.536
The one thing
i can offer is protection,

20:05.538 --> 20:08.239
So i hired a proper gumshoe,

20:08.241 --> 20:12.577
And gathered all the information
i could on your new beau.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.378
And it breaks my heart,

20:14.380 --> 20:17.582
But it appears
your chester creb

20:17.584 --> 20:21.552
Is an absolutely
beastly sicko!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.157
We don't need
to see that.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.159
What is wrong with you?

20:28.161 --> 20:30.094
You are a troublemaker,

20:30.096 --> 20:32.430
And we don't trust you,
not one single bit!

20:32.432 --> 20:34.899
Well, ta-ta, then.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.901
I've done what i can.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.502
Mother always told me,

20:38.504 --> 20:40.905
Never argue with a woman
when she's angry.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.219
(car approaching)

20:55.221 --> 20:58.122
(jimmy groaning)

21:00.260 --> 21:03.127
(door creaks open,
footsteps approaching)

21:03.129 --> 21:04.695
Who's there?

21:04.697 --> 21:07.198
My boy.
(thunder crackling)

21:08.301 --> 21:10.701
(groaning softly)

21:10.703 --> 21:14.272
My boy... You look like shit.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.806
Here. Drink.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.478
(coughing)

21:20.480 --> 21:22.413
(groans)

21:22.415 --> 21:24.415
(shuddering breaths)

21:24.417 --> 21:26.984
(sighs, panting)

21:28.154 --> 21:30.288
What's that?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.460
Penicillin.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.100
I would hate to make you whole

21:43.102 --> 21:45.836
Only to see you die
of an infection.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.071
Who the hell are you?

21:47.073 --> 21:48.939
I am massimo dolcefino.

21:48.941 --> 21:52.243
I have come to make you
your new hands, hmm?

21:52.245 --> 21:54.111
Okay?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.680
Elsa:
Massimo is an old
friend of mine

21:55.682 --> 21:57.181
From before the war.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.983
He's a master artisan.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.251
Just a carpenter. Here.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.153
Jimmy:
You want to make me

22:02.155 --> 22:03.954
Wooden hands?
They will be

22:03.956 --> 22:07.158
Mostly decorative,
but you will decide

22:07.160 --> 22:10.928
On appearance and functionality.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.296
No, thanks.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.265
I seen those army guys

22:14.267 --> 22:16.534
Who got their hands
blown off by grenades.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.337
They got those nifty hooks.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.305
Can't jerk off
for shit with them,

22:21.307 --> 22:24.775
But at least i can hold
a cigarette all myself.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.345
And it beats worrying about
termites the rest of my life.

22:27.347 --> 22:30.314
What massimo offers
is more elegant

22:30.316 --> 22:31.349
Than a pair of
rusty hooks.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.484
And more convincing.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.454
Look.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.393
You see?

22:42.395 --> 22:43.294
(knocking)

22:43.296 --> 22:44.362
The other one, too.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.132
Massimo saved my life.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.734
If it weren't for him,

22:49.736 --> 22:51.702
There would be
no fraulein elsa's

22:51.704 --> 22:53.471
Cabinet of curiosities.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.039
Your mother
would have died in that

22:55.041 --> 22:58.376
Drunk tank and you would
have starved on the street.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.045
I would have married him...

23:01.047 --> 23:03.214
(wry chuckle)

23:03.216 --> 23:05.282
(whispers): ...If you
hadn't been such a fool.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.988
(speaks italian)

23:12.392 --> 23:16.427
"my only sin..."

23:16.429 --> 23:18.496
<i>Si.</i>

23:20.433 --> 23:22.600
"...Was loving you..."

23:22.602 --> 23:24.635
Too much.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.407
Elsa:
<i>(breathing heavily) no!</i>
<i>(chainsaw starts)</i>

23:29.409 --> 23:31.742
Massimo:<i> The men who took</i>
<i>my beloved's legs--</i>

23:31.744 --> 23:33.411
<i>They weren't</i>
<i>your average psychopaths.</i>

23:33.413 --> 23:35.079
<i>They were</i>
<i>the institutionalized ones.</i>

23:35.081 --> 23:36.614
<i>Judges, representatives of</i>
<i>the foreign office,</i>

23:36.616 --> 23:38.382
<i>Even members of the party.</i>

23:38.384 --> 23:40.651
<i>And they had a leader--</i>
<i>a doctor by trade.</i>

23:46.025 --> 23:47.425
Elsa:
<i>For two years,</i>

23:47.427 --> 23:50.027
Massimo took care of me.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.263
He taught me to walk.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.631
And then to dance.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.966
Then hindenburg died.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.903
Nuremberg, the rhineland...

23:58.905 --> 24:00.704
It was time for us to get out

24:00.706 --> 24:03.307
While we still could.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.509
We had a plan.

24:07.447 --> 24:11.415
How could i look
at my<i> amore</i> in the eyes

24:11.417 --> 24:14.618
Knowing that i'd run away
from those monsters?

24:14.620 --> 24:17.655
Huh? They had to pay.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.723
They had to pay.

24:19.725 --> 24:23.127
<i>I hunted them down, one by one.</i>

24:23.129 --> 24:24.728
Aah!

24:24.730 --> 24:26.130
(grunting)

24:27.500 --> 24:30.434
Massimo:
<i>Finally, i-i found the leader.</i>

24:30.436 --> 24:32.470
<i>Uh, the monster-in-chief.</i>

24:32.472 --> 24:34.472
<i>Dr. Grouper.</i>

24:34.474 --> 24:37.475
<i>I would make sure that</i>
<i>he would not die quickly.</i>

24:41.647 --> 24:43.414
(gunshot)

24:49.856 --> 24:51.922
(breathing heavily)

24:51.924 --> 24:54.825
<i>And i would not die quickly</i>
<i>either, apparently.</i>

24:54.827 --> 24:58.128
<i>He took my attempt</i>
<i>to kill him personally.</i>

24:58.130 --> 25:02.366
<i>Very personally.</i>

25:02.368 --> 25:05.636
(massimo screaming)

25:05.638 --> 25:07.271
(electric buzzing)

25:07.273 --> 25:08.539
<i>I was tortured for months.</i>

25:08.541 --> 25:10.474
<i>For months.</i>

25:10.476 --> 25:11.942
<i>Then months in</i>
<i>a windowless cell.</i>

25:16.382 --> 25:18.883
Jimmy:
<i>How did you survive?</i>

25:18.885 --> 25:21.118
An ss general,

25:21.120 --> 25:22.720
A man of higher authority

25:22.722 --> 25:26.657
Than my torturer, dr. Grouper...

25:26.659 --> 25:29.660
He wanted new bookshelves--

25:29.662 --> 25:31.629
He was an avid book collector--

25:31.631 --> 25:34.198
For his new library
of stolen books.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.901
So i spent the
rest of the war

25:36.903 --> 25:39.503
In austria.

25:39.505 --> 25:42.873
And, uh, i went
to america in-in '47.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.577
And i searched for
miss mars for years.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.213
When i finally located her,

25:49.215 --> 25:51.315
I wrote to her.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.484
But i did not hear back.

25:53.486 --> 25:57.221
Jimmy: Well, if you
loved her so much,

25:57.223 --> 25:59.523
And you knew where she was,

25:59.525 --> 26:02.893
Why not just
sweep her off her feet?

26:02.895 --> 26:06.330
My body survived the torture,

26:06.332 --> 26:08.232
But i...

26:08.234 --> 26:10.334
I am like pinocchio.

26:10.336 --> 26:13.437
I have no humanity
left in me anymore.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.773
I... No soul, i cannot love.

26:22.014 --> 26:25.015
But, uh...
(speaking italian)

26:25.017 --> 26:26.850
Sweet irony.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.118
Sweet irony.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.630
Chester:<i> Now i know</i>
<i>you've been together</i>

26:39.632 --> 26:41.398
<i>For a long time</i>

26:41.400 --> 26:44.602
And change can be difficult
for an established show.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.537
And again-- this is not
about ego, all right?

26:46.539 --> 26:48.572
This is about flow, so...

26:48.574 --> 26:50.207
Bette:
<i>He looks so normal.</i>

26:50.209 --> 26:51.475
Dot:
<i>I thought we agreed</i>

26:51.477 --> 26:52.576
<i>That we wouldn't judge him</i>

26:52.578 --> 26:54.378
<i>Until we had definitive proof.</i>

26:54.380 --> 26:55.946
Bette:
<i>What about the file?</i>

26:55.948 --> 26:58.215
<i>It said he murdered his wife.</i>

26:58.217 --> 27:00.551
Dot:
<i>You're letting dandy's lies</i>
<i>cloud your judgment.</i>

27:00.553 --> 27:02.252
Chester:
...The company into and

27:02.254 --> 27:03.887
Then-then we'll start
with desi, twirling

27:03.889 --> 27:06.590
Her titties, and then
toulouse and penny will do their

27:06.592 --> 27:07.891
Beauty and the beast act,
with a twist,

27:07.893 --> 27:10.594
Uh, followed by
bette and dot and then paul,

27:10.596 --> 27:12.630
Which will give the twins
time to change

27:12.632 --> 27:13.731
Into their
assistant costumes

27:13.733 --> 27:15.065
And we'll finish the show

27:15.067 --> 27:18.469
With marjorie
and the magic act.

27:18.471 --> 27:20.504
Bette:
Dot and i have had a talk.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.641
We don't care to be your
assistant any longer.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.843
Why?

27:25.845 --> 27:28.646
We just... Don't wish to.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.582
Maybe you'll change your mind

27:31.584 --> 27:35.185
After you hear about my finale.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.288
Instead of a volunteer,

27:38.290 --> 27:40.658
I'm gonna saw you two in half.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.427
Two bodies
for two heads.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.129
It'll be a sensation.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.665
A first
in the history of magic.

27:48.601 --> 27:49.833
Come on, girls...

27:49.835 --> 27:52.536
Let's do a little rehearsal.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.672
Bette:
<i>We are not getting</i>
<i>into that box.</i>

27:59.612 --> 28:01.011
No, chester...

28:01.013 --> 28:03.414
We are not getting
into that box.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.618
Now, if you'll
excuse us...

28:07.620 --> 28:09.953
Where are you going?
I haven't dismissed anyone.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.656
Maggie:
I'll do it.
You...

28:12.658 --> 28:15.526
I... I know how the trick works.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.561
I can be
your assistant.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.530
I want to be part of the show.
All i got to do

28:19.532 --> 28:21.865
Is smile and show
a little leg, right?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.934
Right.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.572
Get in the box, lucy.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.349
My name's maggie.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.751
Oop!

28:45.691 --> 28:47.725
Is this your magic act?

28:47.727 --> 28:49.126
It's a little pathetic.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.762
Shut up.

28:51.764 --> 28:52.763
(gasps)

28:52.765 --> 28:54.064
I didn't say anything.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.165
What are you all looking at?

28:55.167 --> 28:56.600
Backstage.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.336
Places! Places!
This is a run-through!

29:12.418 --> 29:14.718
<i>(drumroll)</i>

29:14.720 --> 29:16.720
(applause, whistling)
ladies and gentlemen,

29:16.722 --> 29:19.723
Prepare yourselves to witness

29:19.725 --> 29:21.024
The death-defying feat

29:21.026 --> 29:23.427
First performed by the
great torrini

29:23.429 --> 29:26.230
For pope pius vii.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.600
Originally called the magic saw.

29:29.602 --> 29:32.636
Tonight i will be
presenting it to you

29:32.638 --> 29:34.371
With my own...

29:34.373 --> 29:36.440
Dangerous variation.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.411
Manacles.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.746
(audience gasps)

29:42.748 --> 29:45.249
Maggie:
Uh... Ow...

29:45.251 --> 29:46.884
Hey, i...

29:46.886 --> 29:48.819
I don't-i don't know this part.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.157
I went to a war for you.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.258
You should have died over there.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.227
We loved each other.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.563
Then you had to come back
with your metal plate

29:59.565 --> 30:01.565
And your head full of bees.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.800
(murmured groan)

30:04.603 --> 30:06.170
(cackling)

30:06.172 --> 30:08.338
Chester, stop,
i-i can't pull my

30:08.340 --> 30:09.473
My feet through!
Stop...

30:09.475 --> 30:11.275
Stop talking.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.076
You're distracting me.
Marjorie:
When are

30:13.078 --> 30:15.179
You gonna do real magic?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.980
Stop it, marjorie.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.349
Haven't you done
enough to ruin my life?

30:19.351 --> 30:21.084
You're nothing without me.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.419
I'll show you.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.255
Every one of you.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.457
Chester! Chester!

30:27.459 --> 30:29.693
(screams)

30:29.695 --> 30:31.728
Chester, stop!

30:32.832 --> 30:35.299
Paul:
What the bloody hell?!

30:35.301 --> 30:36.834
(marjorie cackling)

31:10.402 --> 31:12.903
(quiet grunt)

31:13.973 --> 31:15.906
Relax, folks...

31:15.908 --> 31:17.407
It's just a magic show.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.243
It's a magic show.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.811
I can put her
back together. Watch.

31:20.813 --> 31:22.813
I can put her...

31:22.815 --> 31:24.514
Alakazam!

31:24.516 --> 31:27.384
(marjorie cackling)

31:29.021 --> 31:30.921
Abraca...

31:30.923 --> 31:32.155
Abracadabra.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.994
That'll pack 'em in, chester.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.231
(marjorie cackling)

31:41.233 --> 31:44.001
Sh... She made me do it.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.353
She had it coming.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.458
What do we do now?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.560
Steal her jewelry

32:10.562 --> 32:12.863
And bury the bitch.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.601
What's this?
Why are you packing?

32:17.603 --> 32:20.470
You screwed up again.
Time to leave.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.139
You confused me.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.775
You did this on purpose,
to sabotage me.

32:24.777 --> 32:27.044
I was finally happy.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.979
Then stay. I'm leaving!

32:28.981 --> 32:30.948
Not without me, you're not.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.849
Watch me.
I'm sick to death of you.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.153
(grunting)
(grunts) oh.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.291
I loved you.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.026
Chester...

32:52.004 --> 32:55.072
(sobbing):
Oh, god...

32:55.074 --> 32:57.074
Marjorie?

32:57.076 --> 32:59.843
Stay with me.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.845
Marjorie.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.981
(sobbing)

33:06.018 --> 33:09.086

ethel:<i> In his debut act as</i>

33:09.088 --> 33:10.954
A juggler,
please welcome

33:10.956 --> 33:12.990
Your favorite
lobster boy--

33:12.992 --> 33:14.992
And my precious son--

33:14.994 --> 33:16.994
Jimmy darling!

33:16.996 --> 33:18.929
(jaunty music playing,
audience applauding)

33:18.931 --> 33:21.932
I can't. I'm not ready, ma.
I need more practice.

33:21.934 --> 33:23.867
I'm not a performer
like you, ma.

33:23.869 --> 33:24.935
I-i'm happy
just waving my claws,

33:24.937 --> 33:26.837
Just watching them
ooh and ah-- i can...

33:26.839 --> 33:28.839
Listen to your ma.

33:28.841 --> 33:32.009
You got a winning smile
and a winsome way.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.344
You got star quality, jimmy.

33:34.346 --> 33:38.348
Now you get your ass
out there and you show 'em

33:38.350 --> 33:40.217
<i>Why your ma is so proud of you.</i>

33:40.219 --> 33:42.052
(rain falling)

33:42.054 --> 33:43.954
Amazon eve:
Jimmy.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.209
Maggie's dead.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.583
You want the details?

34:18.057 --> 34:20.057
Elsa's next.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.592
Tonight.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.875
Well...

34:38.877 --> 34:40.877
Looks like...

34:40.879 --> 34:43.113
You get a shot at
a normal life now.

34:44.083 --> 34:48.085
Jimmy...

34:48.087 --> 34:50.020
I'm happy for you.

34:55.227 --> 34:57.794

35:11.143 --> 35:13.443
(thunder rumbling)

35:15.881 --> 35:18.882
(gasping)

35:18.884 --> 35:22.152
How dare you come in here
unannounced.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.487
What do you want?

35:23.489 --> 35:25.255
You need to leave.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.791
What are you babbling about?
Your monsters.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.726
They have been plotting
their revenge all day

35:29.728 --> 35:31.061
In ethel's caravan.

35:31.063 --> 35:33.096
They're gonna kill you.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.764
Why should i believe you, huh?

35:34.766 --> 35:36.099
My monsters love me.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.969
I'm like their mother.
Ethel

35:38.971 --> 35:41.805
Was more a mother to them
than you ever were.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.773
You murdered their true mother.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.775
No.
Everybody knows that now.

35:45.777 --> 35:48.245
Rantings of a desperate man.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.113
Who's desperate now?

35:50.115 --> 35:54.184
You saw what
they did to him.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.262
(click)

36:08.934 --> 36:12.569
But where will i go?

36:13.539 --> 36:17.240
Anywhere but here.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.911
(sobs)

36:25.050 --> 36:26.116
(click)

36:28.954 --> 36:30.720
(chuckles)

36:30.722 --> 36:33.590
You would save me.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.161
Now we're even.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.363
(thunder rumbling)

36:48.373 --> 36:50.173
There you are.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.575
How's jimmy doin'?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.143
He'd be here if he could.

36:53.145 --> 36:55.645
It's time.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.916
Give me that.

37:02.154 --> 37:04.888
Ethel!

37:10.195 --> 37:12.929
(rhythmic stomping)

37:19.571 --> 37:22.239
Let's get our girl...

37:22.241 --> 37:24.074
Some justice.

37:29.181 --> 37:31.748
(operatic german song playing)

38:12.958 --> 38:15.292
(thunder rumbling)

38:24.236 --> 38:25.935
(door opens)

38:25.937 --> 38:28.938
Oh.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.740
(grunts)

38:30.742 --> 38:32.309
Thank you for coming.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.578
I never refuse
a lady in distress.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.981
I'm not in distress.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.550
But i am in a rush.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.257
(sniffles)

38:48.260 --> 38:50.660
Oh.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.229
(sighs)

39:00.339 --> 39:01.404
(door shuts)

39:07.279 --> 39:09.245
(thunder rumbling)

39:22.294 --> 39:25.295
I'd like to report a murder.

39:25.297 --> 39:27.330
Whose murder?

39:27.332 --> 39:28.331
A young lady.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.633
Set it down.

39:30.635 --> 39:34.437
Slowly.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.540
I...
Take a step back.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.710
Keep-keep your hands
where i can see 'em.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.816
(sobbing)

39:46.818 --> 39:50.320
I did it.

39:50.322 --> 39:54.124
Send me to the chair!

39:55.494 --> 39:58.294
(crying)

39:59.831 --> 40:02.432
(car approaching)

40:11.510 --> 40:14.344
(sighs)

40:14.346 --> 40:16.346
What are you doing here?

40:16.348 --> 40:18.047
I'm here to
take inventory.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.549
I'm your new owner.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.384
Where's elsa?

40:21.386 --> 40:22.752
She's gone.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.054
Off to follow
her dreams.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.624
Elsa sold us again.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.059
For $10,000 in cash.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.461
A pittance.

40:31.463 --> 40:34.030
Everything here,
including your contracts,

40:34.032 --> 40:36.299
Belongs to me now.

40:36.301 --> 40:41.137
And i want to see what's mine.

40:53.452 --> 40:56.252
Has it always been a
dream of yours, sir?

40:56.254 --> 40:58.621
To be in show business?

40:58.623 --> 41:01.124
A dream.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.126
Yes.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.428
And now it's come true.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.997
(chuckles)

41:09.935 --> 41:11.935
I'm thirsty.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.637
Fetch me a lemonade
with a paper straw.

41:14.639 --> 41:17.707
Right away, sir.

41:34.426 --> 41:37.260
(chuckles)

41:37.262 --> 41:39.529
(kissing)

41:46.671 --> 41:49.239
(clucking, groaning
in distance)

41:59.551 --> 42:01.851
(clucking, groaning continue)

42:15.634 --> 42:18.668
(moaning)

42:18.670 --> 42:21.738
(thunder rumbling)

42:27.712 --> 42:30.280
Are you ready?

42:31.316 --> 42:33.783
Yes.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.725
(inhales, sighs)

42:44.529 --> 42:46.529
They're perfect.

42:46.531 --> 42:48.765
I want
to try them on now.

42:48.767 --> 42:51.434
Yes.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.741
One more.

43:02.380 --> 43:04.447
(clacking, rattling)

43:04.449 --> 43:06.783
You do it.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.331
Thank you.
