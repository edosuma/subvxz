00:01.835 --> 00:02.402
I would like to announce

00:02.402 --> 00:03.670
I would like to
announce my candidacy

00:03.670 --> 00:06.172
in the upcoming election.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.408
Vote smart! Vote Sneer!

00:08.408 --> 00:10.944
Thank you. You're too kind!

00:10.944 --> 00:13.980
Cyril Sneer, watch out!

00:13.980 --> 00:16.549
Mr. Willow: I have no
choice but to declare

00:16.549 --> 00:19.953
Bert Raccoon... disqualified.

00:21.187 --> 00:21.388
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.159
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.563
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.332
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.800 --> 00:35.702
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.703 --> 00:37.771
Yikes!

00:38.538 --> 00:39.839
Yaaaah...

00:42.542 --> 00:43.977
Yeaaaah!

00:43.977 --> 00:46.946
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.856
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:58.091 --> 00:59.726
Cyril Sneer!

01:03.229 --> 01:05.632
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:06.199 --> 01:07.934
the Raccoons!!

01:07.934 --> 01:10.036
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:22.248 --> 01:25.251
It's election time in
the Evergreen Forest,

01:25.251 --> 01:28.088
and everyone is talking about
the race for mayor.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.924
Pig 1: Cyril Sneer for mayor!

01:30.924 --> 01:34.928
Mr Sneer, all we've heard
from you are vague promises.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.897
When I'm mayor, I promise
you'll see lots of changes.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.365
You wanna know what kind?

01:39.365 --> 01:40.867
Vote for me and find out!

01:41.601 --> 01:43.837
Now get off my case, Raccoon!

01:43.837 --> 01:45.738
I get the feeling
we're not going

01:45.738 --> 01:47.373
to like Cyril's changes.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.075
We need
another candidate.

01:49.075 --> 01:52.879
And I happen to know
just the guy for the job.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.515
Ahem, excuse me,

01:55.515 --> 01:57.884
I, Bert Raccoon,

01:57.884 --> 02:00.553
would like to announce
my candidacy

02:00.553 --> 02:03.189
in the upcoming election.
What?!

02:03.189 --> 02:07.026
And I challenge Mr Sneer
to debate the issues

02:07.026 --> 02:09.028
on live television.

02:09.028 --> 02:13.233
Vote Bert Raccoon for mayor!!

02:16.369 --> 02:16.870
That's the trouble

02:16.870 --> 02:17.971
That's the
trouble with everyone

02:17.971 --> 02:19.806
in the future-fearing-forest,

02:19.806 --> 02:22.442
they can't see the
forest for the trees.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.444
Once I'm mayor,
I'm going to make

02:24.444 --> 02:26.446
some of my dreams come true.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.414
Remember the Evergreen forest's

02:28.414 --> 02:30.383
first and only tourist boom?

02:30.383 --> 02:33.219
Since the monster,
Evie was spotted,

02:33.219 --> 02:35.421
we've had a lot of
suckers, ehm, tourist.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.257
And I know what they want.

02:37.257 --> 02:40.326
Sneer's Monster theme park

02:40.326 --> 02:43.663
to be built right here on the
shores of Evergreen Lake.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.765
There will be 2,000 rooms,

02:45.765 --> 02:48.201
eight restaurants
and a bowling alley,

02:48.201 --> 02:51.171
not to mention
parking for 5,000!

02:51.171 --> 02:53.506
It didn't quite work out, boys.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.275
But remember that oil deal?

02:55.275 --> 02:57.944
Oil! Black gold!

02:57.944 --> 03:01.347
Texas tea! Mammoth, yeah,

03:01.347 --> 03:03.116
what do you charge
for an oil rig?

03:04.284 --> 03:05.785
That much, eh?

03:05.785 --> 03:08.588
Yeah, yeah, I'll take a dozen.

03:08.588 --> 03:11.524
That Raccoon messed
up that deal too!

03:11.524 --> 03:15.895
Pig 1: Oh, yes boss, it's
been a long, hard road.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.264
Pig 2: And things you
went through, boss.

03:18.264 --> 03:21.134
The humiliation,
the embarrassment,

03:21.134 --> 03:24.304
oh, the outrageous degradation.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.973
Have I got
something for you!

03:26.973 --> 03:29.509
Lady Baden-Baden: Oh!
There's a man in here!

03:29.509 --> 03:31.878
Wait! Ladies!

03:31.878 --> 03:33.379
Hunting, shmunting!

03:33.379 --> 03:37.317
I'm going to show Knox what
making a business deal

03:37.317 --> 03:38.651
is all about.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.954
When I get through with him,

03:40.954 --> 03:42.422
he'll be alligator.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.025
Pig 3: No matter how
tough things got, boss,

03:46.025 --> 03:48.027
you got tougher!

03:48.361 --> 03:50.997
Of all the plants
in all the world...

03:50.997 --> 03:52.098
Owwwwch!

03:52.098 --> 03:55.802
Lady Baden-Baden
has to grow cactus!

03:55.802 --> 03:56.803
Oww!

03:56.803 --> 03:58.671
Enough about the painful past.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.174
It's the future we've
got to think about!

04:01.174 --> 04:03.376
Now get out there
and tell the people

04:03.376 --> 04:05.511
they can count on Cyril Sneer!

04:06.412 --> 04:08.381
You've got some good
thoughts here, Bert.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.384
Let's just rework it.
Hm, that can go and that...

04:11.384 --> 04:12.685
Gee...
...and this.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.754
I-I can't do this stuff,

04:14.754 --> 04:16.923
why would anyone vote for me?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.658
A lots of reasons.
Name one.

04:18.658 --> 04:19.859
You're resourceful.

04:19.859 --> 04:22.028
Remember when the Prism
of Zenda went missing?

04:22.695 --> 04:26.199
I suppose you're all
wondering why I called you here,

04:26.199 --> 04:27.433
Get on with it!

04:27.433 --> 04:30.703
I, Bert Raccoon,
ace detective,

04:30.703 --> 04:33.539
am about to reveal
the whereabouts

04:33.539 --> 04:36.175
of the Prism of Zenda.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.343
Hurry up!

04:37.343 --> 04:41.881
Triumph is to
be savored, Mr Sneer.

04:41.881 --> 04:44.984
Now let's review the facts.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.120
Do we have to?
One...

04:49.055 --> 04:51.758
The gem disappeared in the dark,

04:51.758 --> 04:55.261
but the lights were off
for only a few seconds

04:55.261 --> 04:57.230
and when the
lights came back on,

04:57.230 --> 04:59.465
the pedestal was still rocking.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.902
Two, everyone has
looked everywhere

05:02.902 --> 05:04.837
a gem could be hidden.

05:04.837 --> 05:07.807
Except one place.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.109
Where? Where?

05:10.109 --> 05:13.746
Cedric, your
spectacles, if you please.

05:16.215 --> 05:20.720
Notice how glass is almost
invisible underwater.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.688
So?!

05:21.688 --> 05:24.123
The same is true
for crystals!

05:24.791 --> 05:26.492
Crystals like...

05:27.527 --> 05:30.229
The Prism of Zenda!!!!

05:31.664 --> 05:34.734
Yeah, I can handle
a mystery, but...

05:34.734 --> 05:38.004
Now Bert, I think
you can handle anything!

05:38.004 --> 05:41.708
Gosh, I'll never forget when
that bully was out to get me.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.011
Uaaaaah!

05:45.011 --> 05:47.647
Yaaaaaah!

05:47.647 --> 05:50.516
Cedric, it's me!

05:50.516 --> 05:52.185
It's me, Bert!

05:52.185 --> 05:53.353
Bert/Cedric: Uaaah!

05:53.353 --> 05:56.289
Ah! Oh, Bert,

05:56.289 --> 05:58.925
am I glad to see you!

05:58.925 --> 06:00.927
I thought you were Bonneville.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.629
Are you ready to go?
You bet, I am!

06:03.629 --> 06:07.633
And I'm not going to worry about
Bonneville anymore tonight.

06:07.633 --> 06:11.237
That-a-boy, Cedric!
And maybe we can figure out

06:11.237 --> 06:13.906
some way to get that
bully out of your hair!

06:15.475 --> 06:16.943
Cedric!

06:16.943 --> 06:21.080
Yessiree Bert, you stood
beside me in my darkest hour.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.550
And now you found us, so
what are you gonna do about it?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.886
I just
wanna talk to Cedric.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.122
Look, Cedric, I've been...

06:29.122 --> 06:31.491
Well, he doesn't
wanna talk to you.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.059
There's no way out.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.227
Heyyy!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.361
Oh-oh!

06:35.361 --> 06:37.530
We can always
count on you, Bert,

06:37.530 --> 06:39.832
but you know what else
a great statesman needs?

06:39.832 --> 06:42.201
Imagination. And
let's face it, Bert,

06:42.201 --> 06:44.871
all you need is a top hat,
and voila.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.286
And who else can turn
a hike in the hills

07:00.286 --> 07:01.721
into a trek through time?

07:01.721 --> 07:05.224
This looks like a
pretty hairy situation

07:05.224 --> 07:06.993
here at the beginning of time.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.066
They don't
make dinosaurs

07:14.066 --> 07:16.068
like they used to, eh Broo?

07:18.037 --> 07:20.273
We're not
just saying this, Bert.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.442
You do have what it
takes to be a leader.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
I suppose
I have been known to

07:24.444 --> 07:27.113
plunge into the
odd new situation.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.482
Uuuuh-oh!

07:29.482 --> 07:30.783
Yeaaaah! Au!

07:38.891 --> 07:41.894
You're right!
I can win the race for Mayor!

07:41.894 --> 07:44.764
Cyril Sneer, watch out!

07:45.932 --> 07:48.668
And in conclusion,
I can only say,

07:48.668 --> 07:51.304
Vote smart. Vote Sneer.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.439
Thank you. Thank you.

07:53.439 --> 07:54.874
Well, how was I, coach?

07:54.874 --> 07:56.642
Brilliant? Stunning, captivating?

07:56.642 --> 07:57.844
Lady Baden-Baden: Uuuh...

07:57.844 --> 08:00.046
You've been a great help,
Lady Baden-Baden.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.448
What with your extensive
background in the theater.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.817
Tell you what.
As soon as I'm Mayor,

08:04.817 --> 08:07.587
I'll get you a cushy job
in my administration.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.655
How does assistant
to the mayor sound?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.325
Lady Baden-Baden: Ooooh...
I don't think so,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.927
you and I don't really
see eye-to-eye

08:14.927 --> 08:16.963
on many issues, do we?

08:16.963 --> 08:20.299
Uh now, you take this
tape home, and study it.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.901
Thanks, Lady Baden-Baden.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.304
Okay, Bert, you've
got a few things lined up

08:25.304 --> 08:27.773

Cyril this afternoon.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.375

Ah, Melissa
I've given about

08:33.145 --> 08:35.548

11:19.645 --> 11:22.214
I welcomed you into
my home with open arms.

11:22.214 --> 11:26.285
... in my
own deepest grief.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.054
What are you
babbling about, Knox?!

11:28.054 --> 11:30.723
The fair
Lady Baden-Baden and I

11:30.723 --> 11:34.427
have come to a
partin' of the ways.

11:34.427 --> 11:37.329
Our marriage is over.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.699
I'll be staying
in the back bedroom.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.301
You don't mind, do you Sir?

11:42.301 --> 11:45.171
Ehm, but.. ehm...

11:46.272 --> 11:48.140
Why, I even let you win at golf!

11:58.217 --> 11:59.218
What?!

12:01.754 --> 12:03.823
Face it Knox,

12:03.823 --> 12:07.026
there's nothing I
wouldn't do for you.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.027
Nothing!!

12:19.238 --> 12:20.606
Ehm...
Oh, no!

12:20.606 --> 12:22.875
I know what you're
going to say and I agree.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.643
Vote smart. Vote Sneer.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.378
I'm glad we had
this little chat.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.013
Uhm, uhm...

12:28.013 --> 12:31.751
(to himself) Sneer, you
were born to be a politician!

12:33.052 --> 12:35.020
And remember,
after the speech,

12:35.020 --> 12:37.089
hand out these
flowers to the ladies.

12:38.557 --> 12:40.659
Um, good
afternoon, ladies.

12:40.659 --> 12:43.329
I'm honored to be
here at the, uh...

12:43.329 --> 12:45.331
oh, the Flower Guild!

12:45.331 --> 12:48.701
As a longtime resident
of the Evergreen forest,

12:48.701 --> 12:51.771
I am in favor of, ahem,

12:51.771 --> 12:54.507
diverse cultural activities.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.877
One of my all time favorite
cultural events was

12:57.877 --> 12:59.712
the Evergreen Air show.

12:59.712 --> 13:03.282
It was a thrilling afternoon
of aerobatic artistry,

13:03.282 --> 13:06.552
as our own Ralph Raccoon
flew the race of his life

13:06.552 --> 13:09.121
in a dazzling display of...

13:09.121 --> 13:10.723
well, you had to be there.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.793
Uaaaah! Ooooh!

13:16.028 --> 13:19.999
Ah! Uaaaaaaah!

13:19.999 --> 13:22.201
Oaaaah! Oh boy!

13:23.936 --> 13:25.271
What's going on?

13:25.271 --> 13:27.273
He'd better not crash!

13:27.273 --> 13:29.141
That's my plane!

13:29.141 --> 13:33.145
Uaaaaah!

13:33.145 --> 13:36.315
Woaaaaaah!

13:38.784 --> 13:41.086
Oh, no!

13:46.158 --> 13:49.228
And as mayor,
I intend to bring you

13:49.228 --> 13:51.163
more cultural activities

13:51.163 --> 13:53.165
just like that one!

13:53.766 --> 13:55.935
And now, ladies, I have a little

13:55.935 --> 13:59.438
token of my appreciation
for each of you.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.177
Pig 1: (sniffs) Oooh...

14:05.177 --> 14:07.246
Pig 2: Assistants to the mayor?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.515
Ohh, has quite a ring to it.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.252
Pig 1: We've been training our
entire lives for this job.

14:13.252 --> 14:16.856
The pinnacle of a long and
distinguished career.

Pig 3: Executive
washrooms, here we come.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.176
Pig 2:

15:45.010 --> 15:47.780
And in conclusion,
I can only say,

15:47.780 --> 15:50.082
'Vote smart. Vote Sneer!'

15:50.549 --> 15:52.084
Pop?

15:52.084 --> 15:54.386
It's almost time for
your debate with Bert.

15:54.386 --> 15:56.255
We better get down
to the station.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.857
I'll run rhetorical rings

15:58.857 --> 16:00.225
'round that Raccoon.

16:01.894 --> 16:05.397
Pig 1: Typical! The boss is
off gallivanting somewhere,

16:05.397 --> 16:08.767
while we slave over a
hot election campaign!

16:08.767 --> 16:10.803
Pig 3: There's his honor now.

16:12.604 --> 16:16.008
Pig 2: Hey, what's Lady
Baden-Baden doing there?

16:16.008 --> 16:18.043
Tell you what,
as soon as I'm mayor,

16:18.043 --> 16:20.879
I'll get you a cushy job
in my administration.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.148
How does assistant
to the mayor sound?

16:23.949 --> 16:25.818
Pig 2: The boss is
gonna dump us

16:25.818 --> 16:28.387
and hire Lady
Baden-Baden. Oh-oh-oh!

16:28.387 --> 16:32.424
Pig 1: They always said, all it
takes was it dirty business.

16:32.424 --> 16:36.061
Pig 3: Well, it's going
to get a lot dirtier.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.266
Three cheers for Bert!
Hip-hip-hooray!

16:41.266 --> 16:43.669
Now, we begin taking calls

16:43.669 --> 16:45.771
from our television audience.

16:45.771 --> 16:51.076
The number is 555-K.N.O.X.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.779
I said, 555...
Pig 1: I don't know
about this, Lloyd.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.383
Pig 2: Shh! Do you want Lady
Baden-Baden to take our job?

16:57.383 --> 16:59.618
Hello, Citizens forum?

16:59.618 --> 17:02.121
My question is for Cyril Sneer.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.124
Mr Sneer, isn't it true you put

17:05.124 --> 17:08.327
money ahead of your own family?
Nonsense!

17:08.327 --> 17:11.764
Pig 2: Well, what about the
time JP Gordon was in town?

17:11.764 --> 17:14.133
Now hold on,
I-I can explain.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.370
I was supposed to go to
Cedric's camp reunion,

17:18.370 --> 17:21.540
but I was also supposed
to land a big contract.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.108
Oh, hi, Pop!

17:23.108 --> 17:25.477
Look, son, I don't think

17:25.477 --> 17:27.446
I'll be able to make that train.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.214
It's this deal I'm working on,

17:29.214 --> 17:31.583
you know how important
it is, don't you?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.952
Um, I guess so, Pop.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.055
I just cannot leave

17:36.055 --> 17:37.723
until I get the signature.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.458
I may never have another chance.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.127
You understand,
don't you, Cedric?

17:42.127 --> 17:44.063
I'm doing this for you.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.165
I'll go with you next year, son.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.166
I promise.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.500
Sure, Pop!

17:52.471 --> 17:55.407
Ha-ha, well, you know
how those things are.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.909
Pig 2: I rest my case.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.610
Ah, just hang on there.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.546
You haven't got
the whole story.

18:00.546 --> 18:04.216
It's what Cyril did after
he found Cedric's gift.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.485
What's this?!

18:06.485 --> 18:09.221
If this is my birthday,
then where's that...

18:09.721 --> 18:10.722
...cake?

18:14.660 --> 18:17.429
To the best Pop in the world.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.298
On the occasion

18:19.298 --> 18:23.068
of our first Father-Son banquet.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.704
Love, Cedric.

18:25.704 --> 18:29.174
Ohh Cedric, what have I done?

18:30.209 --> 18:31.710
I can just make it!

18:33.579 --> 18:35.547
Hold that train!

18:40.452 --> 18:41.820
Excuse me...

18:41.820 --> 18:43.689
...but is this seat taken?

18:43.689 --> 18:46.258
Pop, I thought
you weren't coming!

18:46.258 --> 18:49.394
What?
And miss your speech?!

18:49.962 --> 18:51.964
Thanks for the cufflinks, son!

18:51.964 --> 18:54.299
They're exactly what I needed

18:54.299 --> 18:56.301
at just the right time.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.972
And to think I almost
gave up a Father-Son banquet

18:59.972 --> 19:03.075
to meet some snob
of a multi-billionaire.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.444
I don't know what came over me.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.479
Ah, that's okay, Pop.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.050
So, much as
I hate to admit it,

19:12.050 --> 19:15.621
Cyril Sneer is not the
stinker you think he is.

19:15.621 --> 19:16.755
I am not?!

19:16.755 --> 19:19.258
I mean, of course I'm not.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.393
Thanks for the support, Raccoon.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.795
I think you just
won me the election.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.169
Mr. Willow:
Thank you, Mr Bostick.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.772
Pig 1: Why couldn't that Raccoon
just keep his mouth shut?

19:33.772 --> 19:36.808
We had the boss on the ropes.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.610
Pig 2: We've got to make
sure that Raccoon gets

19:38.610 --> 19:40.846
every vote he's got
coming to him!

19:40.846 --> 19:45.350
Pig 3: Well, he's got
about 5,000 coming from us.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.022
Mr. Willow: Good
afternoon, everyone.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.358
I've just finished toting up
the election results

19:53.358 --> 19:59.464
and the final count is...
Cyril Sneer, 200 votes.

20:00.766 --> 20:06.004
Bert Raccoon 5,331.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.639
Hoorray!

20:07.639 --> 20:10.676
I won, guys!
I'm the mayor!!

20:10.676 --> 20:13.178
Mr Willow: However,
I'm sorry to report

20:13.178 --> 20:15.781
there is a serious
irregularity in the count,

20:15.781 --> 20:20.152
which means... someone
stuffed the ballot box

20:20.152 --> 20:23.455
with 5,001 fake votes!

20:23.455 --> 20:26.158
Mr Willow: I have no
choice but to declare

20:26.158 --> 20:29.695
Bert Raccoon disqualified.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.896
Awwwww!
What!?

20:30.896 --> 20:34.166
I'm mayor! Ha, me!!!

20:34.166 --> 20:36.368
Ah, sweet, sweet victory!

20:36.368 --> 20:37.536
Pig 1: I don't believe it!

20:37.536 --> 20:39.638
If we hadn't rigged
the vote for Bert,

20:39.638 --> 20:41.240
he would have won anyway!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.374
Oh-ooooh!

20:42.374 --> 20:44.977
Pig 2: We've got
one last chance, boys.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.812
Meet your mayor!

20:46.812 --> 20:48.213
I love you!

20:48.213 --> 20:51.149
Pig 3: Boss, ehm,
eheh, Mr Mayor?

20:51.149 --> 20:54.052
Please don't fire us!

20:54.052 --> 20:56.154
Pig 2: You can't hire
Lady Baden-Baden.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.023
What are you sniffling
sausages raving about?

20:58.023 --> 21:00.092
I'm trying to enjoy
my victory here.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.561
Pig 1: You'd never
have won without us.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.664
We were the ones who
rigged the election!

21:05.664 --> 21:06.832
You did what?

21:06.832 --> 21:10.102
Pig 3: You can't fire us
and hire Lady Baden-Baden.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.271
You owe us.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.605
I owe you, alright.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.209
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:17.209 --> 21:19.211
I have an important announcement.

21:19.211 --> 21:23.282
The election was rigged by
these manipulating meatballs.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.717
I demand another election.
Aaaah!

21:30.522 --> 21:33.058
Lady Baden-Baden wins

21:33.058 --> 21:35.594
mayor's race by a landslide.

21:35.594 --> 21:38.764
Cyril Sneer blames media.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.299
Don't you wish
you'd gotten back out

21:40.299 --> 21:41.900
on the campaign trail, Bert?

21:41.900 --> 21:45.470
Nah, I'm not really
cut out for the political life.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.240
Lady Baden-Baden is
so much better choice.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.476
Besides, I was
mayor for a minute.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.944
I wonder
how Cyril's taking

21:52.944 --> 21:54.613
his second straight defeat?

21:54.613 --> 21:56.548
Uaaaah!
You've got an
appointment, alright!

21:56.548 --> 21:58.884
An appointment with doom!

21:58.884 --> 22:03.889
