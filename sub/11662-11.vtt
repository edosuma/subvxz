(mellow music playing)

01:04.600 --> 01:07.066
Thanks for bringing the boys over,
Dreyfuss.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.300
So long, kids!

01:20.734 --> 01:24.600
I just love it when Dreyfuss
brings the puppies over to play.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.367
I think they like it, too.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.467
That's because you bring the stick
to them.

01:30.266 --> 01:33.400
I know. They get so excited when I fetch.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.934
You like having them over, too,

01:37.000 --> 01:38.734
-don't you, Sophia?
-Yeah, I like them.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.133
Because it temporarily shifts the blame
if we find a puddle on the floor.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.100
Once, nurse ratchet. Once.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.400
I don't believe it.
Saturday, and I don't have a date.

01:53.467 --> 01:56.867
-Do you fathom what this means?
-The jail break is off?

01:58.500 --> 02:01.967
Do what I do when I don't have a date.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.900
I curl up with a good book,
and I'm satisfied.

02:04.967 --> 02:07.200
It's my fault. I read to her as a child.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.567
I'm going to the library soon.
You want to come?

02:11.633 --> 02:13.800
The library? That's a great idea.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.133
-I just love libraries.
-You do?

02:16.200 --> 02:18.400
I've loved books since I was a child,

02:18.467 --> 02:21.867
although I grew up
around some ignorant people.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.800
You know what horrible thing
folks in my neck of the woods did

02:25.867 --> 02:27.233
when I was a young'un?

02:27.300 --> 02:30.800
Besides using phrases like "neck
of the woods" and "young'un"?

02:32.233 --> 02:33.767
They burned books.

02:33.834 --> 02:37.266
The townspeople made a big pile of them
in front of the library

02:37.333 --> 02:39.200
and threw a torch on top.

02:39.266 --> 02:41.233
Only big daddy was outraged.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.467
He fought his way through that crowd,

02:43.533 --> 02:46.934
clawed his way to the top of that pile,
grabbed that lit torch,

02:47.033 --> 02:52.066
turned to that crowd, and said,
"What are you doing? This is lunacy.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.600
You start a fire from the bottom."

02:56.066 --> 03:01.066
(serene music playing)

03:08.567 --> 03:12.567
-Oh, so many books.
-That's why they call it a library.

03:13.834 --> 03:17.166
It's from the Latin, <i>librarius,</i>
which means "so many books."

03:17.233 --> 03:21.667
-I'm sure you'll find something you want.
-I do believe you're right.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.233
Excuse me.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.233
My friend would like
to apply for a library card.

03:29.567 --> 03:30.600
What friend?

03:32.233 --> 03:35.767
Oh, the one who's checking out
everything but the books.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.834
Hi, what you reading?

03:40.166 --> 03:45.000
Oh, you must be a passionate
man, <i>Females to Fondle?</i>

03:45.066 --> 03:48.867
-Well, it's volume 7 of the encyclopedia.
-Oh.

03:48.934 --> 03:50.967
(chuckles)

03:54.567 --> 03:57.433
My mother talked me into
getting her the new Steven King.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.066
Well, we do have the one
that came out last Tuesday.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.433
Well, as long as it's not
about some little creature

04:02.500 --> 04:06.233
who finds new and inventive ways
of terrifying a household.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.100
It's for my mother,
I don't want to give her any ideas.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.000
You're a sports agent?

04:13.066 --> 04:18.033
I was one of the first women ever allowed
in the Miami dolphins' locker room.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.333
-Reporter?
-Photographer.

04:22.633 --> 04:26.734
There must be some mistake.
I'm sure my mother's card is current.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.133
See for yourself.
It expired five years ago.

04:30.867 --> 04:35.266
I don't know how that could have happened,
but I'll put the book on my card.

04:35.333 --> 04:41.000
My card is always current.
I come here three times a week.

04:41.066 --> 04:43.867
My books are always returned promptly

04:43.934 --> 04:47.133
during regular library hours,
rain or shine.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.500
Who are you to judge me?

04:53.533 --> 04:55.567
Let me get this right.

04:55.934 --> 04:58.266
Dinner at your place tonight?

04:59.166 --> 05:03.033
What kind of girl do you think I am,
and how could you tell so fast?

05:06.133 --> 05:09.767
My address is on my card.
I'm meeting with a client.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.900
I better get rolling. See you at 8:00.

05:16.967 --> 05:21.867
(calm music playing)

05:24.266 --> 05:28.266
By the way, Ma,
they said that your library card

05:28.333 --> 05:30.367
had expired five years ago.

05:30.433 --> 05:33.467
Really? Where could I have been?

05:36.700 --> 05:39.967
Oh, yeah.
Locked in an old age home.

05:42.633 --> 05:46.000
I cannot go through with it.
I'm calling Ted to cancel.

05:46.066 --> 05:47.633
Oh, Blanche, you can't.

05:47.700 --> 05:52.834
-He should have told me he was disabled.
-Yeah. What a great icebreaker.

05:57.734 --> 06:00.700
If I have to go,
you know what I could do?

06:00.767 --> 06:02.166
I could take a chaperon.

06:02.233 --> 06:04.533
That way I'll avoid any awkward
situations.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.066
-Dorothy, be my chaperon.
-Oh, please.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.433
No, I'm serious.
You're the perfect third wheel.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.000
I don't mean that in a negative way.

06:17.066 --> 06:19.900
I just mean you make men uncomfortable.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.066
It's a gift. Don't waste it.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.500
Well, as long as you don't mean it
in a negative way.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.467
Of course not.

06:32.533 --> 06:36.233
-You know, growing up in the south--
-God, here it comes!

06:36.300 --> 06:39.367
The honeysuckle, mint juleps,
three-legged dogs,

06:39.433 --> 06:42.333
you and Opie and Floyd
and the barbershop.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.667
Blanche, get to the point!

06:50.767 --> 06:54.567
I need a chaperon. Do I have to call in
the favors you owe me?

06:54.633 --> 06:56.767
-What favors?
-I need a chaperon.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.300
Do I have to call in the favors
you owe me?

07:00.233 --> 07:02.667
-I don't owe you any.
-Oh, really?

07:03.266 --> 07:05.600
"But, officer, the little old lady
was with me.

07:05.667 --> 07:08.767
She couldn't possibly
have put that banana in your tailpipe."

07:12.133 --> 07:13.934
It will be an honor to serve.

07:16.567 --> 07:19.567
Guess what!
I spoke with Harry this morning.

07:19.633 --> 07:23.600
-He said we can keep one of the puppies.
-No!

07:24.467 --> 07:28.967
-I can't believe you said no.
-Rose, we've talked about pets.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.533
No one's home
during the day to take care of it.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.800
I'm home.

07:32.867 --> 07:35.233
No one lucid is home during the day.

07:37.900 --> 07:42.300
Please. I've already named him Bingo.
He really likes me.

07:42.367 --> 07:45.700
-He follows me wherever I go.
-Rose, the answer is no.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.633
Well, that's not fair.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.734
Last week you got to keep the box boy
who followed you home.

07:56.367 --> 08:00.367
See? You don't need a dog.
If you're lonely, get yourself a man.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.667
I don't want a man.

08:02.734 --> 08:05.967
I want to come home
and have someone jump up on my lap,

08:06.033 --> 08:10.734
-lick my face, and fetch a ball.
-A man can do that.

08:13.934 --> 08:15.333
I'll be right back.

08:17.433 --> 08:20.433
Say hello to the newest
member of our family.

08:21.734 --> 08:22.834
Oh, great.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.200
We got to live with a sad-eyed,
hyperactive nuisance

08:25.266 --> 08:29.333
with the intelligence of a squeaky toy,
and now she's got a dog.

08:30.800 --> 08:37.166
(calm music playing)

08:39.266 --> 08:41.333
(doorbell chimes)

08:46.934 --> 08:50.100
-Miss Devereaux, won't you come in?
-Thank you, Andy.

08:50.166 --> 08:54.133
Blanche, come on in. Sit down.
And who's this?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.033
Who do I look like? I'm her mother.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.333
Grandmother.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.800
Having a chaperon
is an old southern tradition.

09:10.233 --> 09:13.233
Grammy here brought me up
since I was a child.

09:13.300 --> 09:16.500
She taught me how to put up
peach preserves

09:16.567 --> 09:20.033
-and make my own clothes.
-We was po'.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.533
Blanche, you didn't
strike me as needing a chaperon.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.200
It was a tradition.
We southern families stick together.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.000
We sho' do.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.367
I suppose it's been nice having someone
look after you since you were young.

09:51.433 --> 09:55.767
I had to. When she was 15,
I caught her under a pile of hillbillies.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.967
Picture it, me with a crowbar,
prying cousins off left and right.

10:09.033 --> 10:13.500
My goodness, with a view like that,
I bet you look out the window a lot.

10:13.967 --> 10:17.233
-Blanche, are you nervous?
-Nervous? Me? Wheelchair.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.033
Whoops.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.133
I mean, no. No, not at all.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.767
Blanche, most people
in wheelchairs were something else

10:25.834 --> 10:29.367
until that one second before
their accident and their lives changed.

10:29.433 --> 10:32.133
Look at this guy
in the baseball uniform.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.834
I'm still basically that guy.

10:37.934 --> 10:40.533
You certainly do have a nice place here.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.467
I spend so much time in Miami,
and I hate hotels.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.266
Yeah. The way they charge you
for the whole night

10:47.333 --> 10:49.133
when you're only there for a few hours.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.500
My roommate Dorothy told me that.
She's a slut.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.100
-I hope you like champagne and caviar.
-I love it.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.200
Andy.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.133
Oh.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.300
Hey, look who's not po'.

11:23.767 --> 11:27.000
(serene music playing)

11:28.033 --> 11:31.767
-Mmm, this was just delicious.
-I'm glad you feel more comfortable.

11:31.834 --> 11:35.266
Yes. I don't know why I was nervous.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.333
Boy, you should see this bedroom,

11:37.400 --> 11:42.200
a giant-screen TV, a big round bed,
and lights that go on when you clap.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.567
My hands are raw.

11:45.934 --> 11:48.667
That southern accent of yours
really comes and goes.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.633
Grits, all right?

11:53.633 --> 11:55.667
That grandmother of yours is really
a sweetheart.

11:55.734 --> 11:56.667
She sure is.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.367
Bless her heart.
How do we get rid of her?

12:00.533 --> 12:03.633
Ted Tanner, are you making a pass at me?

12:03.700 --> 12:07.100
I may strike out,
but I want my turn at bat.

12:07.567 --> 12:11.166
I have to admit I'm somewhat interested
and a little bit curious,

12:11.233 --> 12:14.567
and suddenly now, quite nervous.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.934
Maybe it's not meant to be
with grandmother wandering around.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.066
She has a bus pass.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.800
I can have Andy drive her.

12:23.567 --> 12:24.567
Come here.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.100
Well, mercy me.

12:30.633 --> 12:33.800
Looks like my little magnolia
just turned into a big ho'.

12:36.133 --> 12:40.333
(mellow music playing)

12:45.734 --> 12:48.934
(serene music playing)

12:49.734 --> 12:51.667
Rose, we have to talk.

12:51.734 --> 12:56.100
The food dish is overturned.
There's a hole in the newspaper.

12:56.166 --> 13:00.500
The potted palm has been dug up.
I cannot live like this.

13:00.567 --> 13:03.200
Please don't send me away.
I'll try harder.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.567
I'm talking about the dog.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.633
Oh. In that case,
I saw him slip two 20s out of your purse.

13:17.166 --> 13:22.233
-Rose, obviously, the dog has to go.
-Well, that's not your decision.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.633
-Where's Blanche?
-She's not home yet.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.600
She spent the night at Ted's?

13:27.166 --> 13:29.367
You don't suppose that... nah.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.867
Because a man's in a wheelchair
doesn't mean he can't satisfy a woman.

13:35.333 --> 13:38.100
-How do you know, Ma?
-Picture it.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.934
Sicily, 1914.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.066
A man in a wheelchair satisfies a woman.
It's a short story, but it makes my point.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.867
Well, hello, my lovelies.

13:54.367 --> 13:59.133
Sophia, I'm sorry I tossed you out
last night, but it was for a good cause.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.166
That's ok. Andy took me home in the limo.
Did we have fun.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.900
I figured out why they
call it a moon roof.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.967
Blanche, tell us about
your date last night.

14:13.033 --> 14:16.734
All I can say is Ted Tanner
is quite a man.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.734
He suits me to a "g."

14:19.667 --> 14:24.367
-You mean to a "t."
-No, I don't think so, Rose.

14:26.467 --> 14:29.700
Don't hold dinner for me tonight.
I have a date.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.300
-I better go get out of these clothes.
-Again?

14:38.467 --> 14:40.000
Rose, you got a reprieve.

14:40.066 --> 14:44.400
If Blanche isn't here, she won't find out
you brought a dog into the house.

14:44.467 --> 14:49.166
What do I care if she finds out?
I'm not afraid. I'm within my rights.

14:49.233 --> 14:52.767
Nothing in my lease
says I can't have a pet.

14:53.233 --> 14:57.367
Who or what ate the heel
off of one of my new red pumps?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.033
I did.

15:01.500 --> 15:08.533
(serene music playing)

15:10.066 --> 15:14.300
I don't like to brag,
and it took me practically all morning,

15:14.367 --> 15:17.900
but by reinforcing the command with love
and a doggy treat,

15:17.967 --> 15:19.834
I taught Bingo to sit.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.700
-Sit down.
-Okey-dokey.

15:27.066 --> 15:29.800
Try to get along with Bingo.

15:29.867 --> 15:33.266
Maybe you don't know the fun
you can have with a pet.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.800
Have you ever had one?

15:34.867 --> 15:40.800
Of course I had a pet.
I was 6 years old, and I wanted a pony.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.433
Not the pony thing again.

15:43.667 --> 15:47.066
She promised me a pony.
She swore I'd get a pony.

15:47.467 --> 15:51.867
She brings me a little paper bird
on a stick,

15:51.934 --> 15:55.567
the kind you have to twirl around your
head to get them to tweet?

15:56.700 --> 15:59.233
-That was your pet?
-They're very clean.

16:01.567 --> 16:06.033
Then she tells me if I'm a good girl,
a really good girl,

16:06.100 --> 16:09.400
God will turn that paper bird
into a real one,

16:09.467 --> 16:12.967
which I believed,
because why would a mother lie?

16:14.900 --> 16:20.967
Every day I'm being very good and praying
and looking for any sign of life

16:21.033 --> 16:24.834
and becoming very attached to that
ridiculous paper bird.

16:25.333 --> 16:29.667
So you can imagine my heartbreak
when, one morning, I find it dead.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.767
How does a paper bird die?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.700
Good question.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.834
Someone used it
to restart the pilot light.

16:45.800 --> 16:51.433
(calm music playing)

16:53.367 --> 16:55.633
Hurry up. Get dressed.
We're going to be late for temple.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.667
Ma, it's Tuesday, and we're catholic.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.700
In that case, bacon and eggs.

17:13.934 --> 17:18.033
Girls, I just don't know what I'm going to
do about Mr. Ted Tanner.

17:18.100 --> 17:21.967
If the man wants to colorize movies,
let him colorize movies.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.867
It's show business, for God's sake.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.033
-Blanche, what's wrong?
-Ted called from Philadelphia.

17:30.100 --> 17:34.433
-He's flying in and wants to see me.
-I'd think you'd be happy.

17:34.500 --> 17:39.233
I am, but since Ted's been out of town,
everything was on hold.

17:39.567 --> 17:43.266
I didn't have to make any decisions
about where our relationship was going.

17:43.333 --> 17:47.400
-I don't know what to do.
-I'm here if you want to pick my brain.

17:51.700 --> 17:55.066
Rose, I think we should leave it alone
and let it heal.

18:02.200 --> 18:06.100
It was clear that he wants to escalate
our relationship.

18:06.166 --> 18:09.000
He said he hoped
I wasn't seeing anyone else.

18:09.834 --> 18:10.900
I just don't know.

18:10.967 --> 18:13.533
You should go for it. See it through.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.867
So many times, you drop somebody

18:15.934 --> 18:18.533
without ever knowing
what it could turn into.

18:18.600 --> 18:23.066
-Sometimes you have to take a chance.
-I don't know about that risk.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.567
A little risk only heightens the thrill.

18:25.633 --> 18:29.567
It's like making love
in an airplane lavatory...

18:31.133 --> 18:32.600
when you know it's wrong

18:32.667 --> 18:36.200
because the guy you're with
really should be at the controls.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.900
It was just an example.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.800
Who are you
to judge me?

18:46.734 --> 18:49.867
(mellow music playing)

18:52.633 --> 18:55.633
-Well, Sophia, did you feed Bingo today.
-To what?

18:58.867 --> 19:01.200
Ma, you did feed the puppy today,
didn't you?

19:01.266 --> 19:03.867
I think we both had one of those
international coffees,

19:03.934 --> 19:06.800
moca-minty or something.
I don't know, we both threw up a little.

19:08.200 --> 19:12.133
Oh, did that mean old lady
put you in the garage?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.367
No, the mean young lady did.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.500
Rose, Ted's coming over later,

19:17.567 --> 19:19.767
and I just don't want
that dog making a big mess.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.967
He's already been into my personal things.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.633
Well, maybe we should
get him some rubber toys.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.400
They do seem to be his preference.

19:32.633 --> 19:35.066
Look, Rose, I don't think
this is going to work out.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.233
Now, we are out all day.
Puppies need care from someone

19:38.300 --> 19:43.233
with a knowledge of loving and nurturing,
and let's face it, that is not ma.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.166
Oh, Bingo.

19:46.667 --> 19:50.834
As much as I love you, little guy,
we've got to do what's best for you.

19:52.633 --> 19:55.734
I wish I knew what to say
to make leaving easier.

19:56.300 --> 20:00.800
You know, I used to have a little dog
just like you back in St. Olaf.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.734
She said, "St. Olaf," Bingo.
I told you, that's the attack command.

20:06.333 --> 20:12.400
(calm music playing)

20:14.333 --> 20:16.567
Ok. Thank you.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.967
Oh, great news.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.900
There's an organization
called pets for people.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.934
They match up pets with old people.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.066
I took Bingo there this afternoon,

20:26.133 --> 20:28.500
and already they have
a perfect home for him.

20:29.033 --> 20:32.433
I hate to say it,
but I'm going to miss him.

20:32.900 --> 20:36.133
Sure was a lot more fun
than that bird on a stick.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.333
Ah, she's not here.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.667
(doorbell rings)

20:47.066 --> 20:49.133
Oh. Get in here, you.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.834
-Oh, I've missed you, Ted.
-I missed you, too.

20:53.133 --> 20:58.333
I just have so much to tell you
about how good I feel about us

20:58.400 --> 21:01.200
and how much I was worried

21:01.266 --> 21:04.500
that you being in a wheelchair
would be more than I could handle,

21:04.567 --> 21:06.400
but I realized it isn't.

21:07.667 --> 21:11.033
-I just really like you.
-I am a lucky guy.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.600
Let's go someplace romantic
for a few days.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.533
-I'm going back home tomorrow.
-Oh. Well, take me with you.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.233
Show me the wonders of Philadelphia,
the liberty bell, the...

21:22.900 --> 21:23.967
cream cheese.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.100
-I can't take you.
-Why not?

21:30.166 --> 21:31.300
I just can't.

21:32.567 --> 21:33.800
Is there someone else?

21:36.100 --> 21:37.233
Oh.

21:38.233 --> 21:41.166
There's somebody else. Oh, a girlfriend.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.100
-You got a wife?
-I'm sorry.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.900
Sorry?

21:49.433 --> 21:51.533
I do not believe this.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.133
I kept telling myself to stay open
to this...

21:55.567 --> 21:58.934
that you were just such a special guy
who happened to be sitting down.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.967
I was starting to feel love for you.

22:02.467 --> 22:03.834
I thought you were noble.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.333
It never dawned on me
you could be a jerk in a wheelchair.

22:10.433 --> 22:11.667
Get out.

22:12.033 --> 22:14.333
We don't have to stop seeing each other.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.066
Blanche Devereaux never goes out
with another woman's husband.

22:18.834 --> 22:23.400
Oh. Except for that one time...
but that was not my fault.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.767
She was pronounced dead.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.367
Those paramedics never give up.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.767
Don't end this.
My wife doesn't understand me.

22:36.834 --> 22:39.633
Well, I do. You're a cheat. Get out.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.233
As God is my witness,
I will never pick up another man...

22:53.834 --> 22:55.033
in a library...

22:57.700 --> 22:58.934
on a Saturday...

23:00.500 --> 23:02.066
unless he's cute...

23:03.000 --> 23:04.500
and drives a nice car.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.233
Amen.

23:14.300 --> 23:18.333
(theme music playing)
