10:52.685 --> 10:55.520
My father was a good man.

He didn't deserve to get
gunned down like an animal.

11:01.321 --> 11:04.938
All he wanted was to meet my daughter.

11:05.376 --> 11:07.079
You're Tina Fields.

11:07.298 --> 11:09.367
You killed my father.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.337

11:13.406 --> 11:15.227
Tina, think about your baby.

If you pull that trigger,
you'll never hold her again.

It's nothing, honey. Stay in your room!

I never wanted to believe

A CI told me that he's obsessed with
this place. He eats here all the time.

He might take a hostage.
Who knows what he could do?

14:58.687 --> 15:01.391
So it's true. He didn't do it.

I'm not a spontaneous guy.

33:18.970 --> 33:21.544
I don't live in the moment like you do.

33:21.806 --> 33:26.145
So, you were trying to
learn how not to Douche.

33:26.745 --> 33:28.144
[chuckles]

33:28.638 --> 33:30.410
Yeah, I guess that's one way to put it.

33:30.435 --> 33:32.239
[both laughing]

33:36.387 --> 33:37.973
Don't tell Chloe.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.924
All right?

33:40.959 --> 33:42.258
[chuckles]

33:44.785 --> 33:45.907
Oh.

33:45.932 --> 33:47.298
<i>[knocks on door]</i>

33:47.799 --> 33:50.106
Oh, it's you. Hello, Detective.

33:50.131 --> 33:53.069
- I got your message.
- Oh, hi.

33:53.138 --> 33:55.239
Feeling back to your old self?

33:55.273 --> 33:58.160
I suppose. So I doubt
I'll be of much help.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.911
Ooh. On second thoughts, it looks
like I came at just the right time.

34:01.980 --> 34:03.910
I've have nothing to say to you.

34:03.935 --> 34:05.782
Thanks to you, I lost my friend.

34:05.850 --> 34:07.317
Friend? What friend?

34:07.352 --> 34:08.351
The doctor.

34:08.386 --> 34:09.851
I was just working through some stuff.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.271
- I didn't think that showing...
- See, that's the problem.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.522
I wish for just one second

34:15.547 --> 34:18.492
you would <i>think</i> about
someone other than yourself.

34:18.530 --> 34:20.463
And there we have it, ladies.

34:20.532 --> 34:21.797
My wake of destruction.

34:21.866 --> 34:23.666
Anyone else you need harmed, hmm?

34:23.702 --> 34:26.069
Okay, Lucifer? Enough.

34:26.137 --> 34:28.685
I'm close to something, I can feel it.

34:29.007 --> 34:30.303
Help.

34:30.661 --> 34:32.178
Fine.

34:35.592 --> 34:38.060
Actually, there is something
that's been bugging me, Detective.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.530
Do you mind if I play the me's
advocate for just a second?

34:40.554 --> 34:41.661
Go ahead.

34:41.687 --> 34:44.114
Well, there's one part of this
puzzle that just doesn't fit.

34:44.139 --> 34:45.357
Joe Fields.

34:45.373 --> 34:46.438
Wha... why doesn't he fit?

34:46.507 --> 34:48.741
Well, you said that he smiled
at you when he was released.

34:48.775 --> 34:50.918
Yeah, I forgot about that.

34:50.943 --> 34:54.112
So, why would an innocent man
smile at the daughter of a man

34:54.138 --> 34:55.928
he took the fall for killing?

34:57.756 --> 34:59.396
He wouldn't.

34:59.959 --> 35:01.197
What are you looking for?

35:01.222 --> 35:03.553
The prints that Ella found
on Fields' transport van.

35:03.578 --> 35:05.193
But those only gave us Rodney Lam.

35:05.218 --> 35:06.659
But there were other prints.

35:06.727 --> 35:08.894
But they cleared as prison personnel.

35:08.963 --> 35:10.763
Like Deputy Warden Perry Smith.

35:10.832 --> 35:13.265
- These are his prints.
- What, you think the warden did it?

35:13.334 --> 35:16.326
Well, deputy wardens are
desk jockeys, bureaucrats.

35:16.405 --> 35:17.938
So his prints shouldn't have been there.

35:18.007 --> 35:20.660
Yes. What if Fields
wasn't smiling at me?

35:20.685 --> 35:24.215
<i>What if he was smiling at the
person next to me? The warden?</i>

35:24.240 --> 35:27.295
So you think that Joe Fields and
the warden had some kind of deal?

35:27.320 --> 35:29.521
- Yes.
- What, Fields serves 16 years...

35:29.553 --> 35:31.325
as a fall guy and then
suddenly has a change of heart?

35:31.387 --> 35:34.154
Well, he had a grandkid.
Maybe he got sick of the deal,

35:34.223 --> 35:35.556
told the warden he wanted out?

35:35.624 --> 35:38.895
And the warden said yes, but
only as a ploy to kill Fields.

35:38.920 --> 35:39.927
Right.

35:39.995 --> 35:41.562
[typing on keyboard]

35:42.935 --> 35:45.666
Deputy Warden Perry Smith

35:45.735 --> 35:48.302
worked in the prison
system for 20 years.

35:48.371 --> 35:51.171
Started as a guard. He's our guy.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.773
Let's go.

35:52.842 --> 35:54.742
Right, well, wouldn't
Dan be more helpful?

35:54.810 --> 35:56.404
What?

35:58.154 --> 36:00.180
If I'm gonna take this guy down,

36:00.249 --> 36:02.649
I need my partner

36:02.818 --> 36:05.452
and that's you. Lucifer Morningstar.

36:05.741 --> 36:06.873
[soft chuckle]

36:07.118 --> 36:08.484
Right.

36:10.493 --> 36:12.226
Good-bye!

36:12.294 --> 36:14.461
I guess I'll just clean up.

36:15.934 --> 36:17.731
I'm dressed for it, apparently.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.440
[siren wailing]

36:22.004 --> 36:23.837
[indistinct radio chatter]

36:24.940 --> 36:26.440
It looks like the cavalry's arrived.

36:26.509 --> 36:29.042
- Dan, what's happening?
- I'm so sorry, Chloe.

36:29.111 --> 36:31.578
- The warden gave us the slip.
- What?

36:41.167 --> 36:42.466
LUCIFER: <i>Are you okay, Detective?</i>

36:42.502 --> 36:45.229
This whole time, my father's
killer's been out there.

36:45.254 --> 36:47.206
And today I let him get away.

36:47.261 --> 36:49.267
So, no, I feel like a failure.

36:49.292 --> 36:51.987
What... you are nothing of the sort.

36:52.167 --> 36:53.600
Detective,

36:54.472 --> 36:58.495
for the first time in 16 years,
you know who the real killer is.

36:58.607 --> 37:01.574
It seems to me that
justice is in your sights.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.323
You're right.

37:03.745 --> 37:04.978
I put out a BOLO.

37:05.013 --> 37:08.331
FBI and DHS are looking at
airports, border crossings.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.351
Well, I've still no idea what
that means, but it sounds good.

37:11.386 --> 37:13.186
It means I'm gonna
get the son of a bitch.

37:13.221 --> 37:15.288
Right. Well...

37:15.357 --> 37:18.534
in the meantime, since
your offspring's with Dan...

37:18.597 --> 37:19.683
What?

37:19.708 --> 37:22.695
I'm simply suggesting that you
open a bottle of wine, or three,

37:22.720 --> 37:26.198
- for yourself, and just have a nice...
- [muffled grunting]

37:34.672 --> 37:36.617
- [man groans loudly]
- Shut up!

37:36.642 --> 37:38.244
[coughing]

37:38.313 --> 37:40.414
LUCIFER [laughing]: Well...

37:40.840 --> 37:43.195
Bravo, Maze.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.087
- How did you get...
- I was bored.

37:48.156 --> 37:49.689
Had nothing to do.

37:49.724 --> 37:54.574
So, I tracked down the scumbag myself.

37:54.598 --> 37:57.099
It just... felt right.

38:02.731 --> 38:04.170
It's gonna feel good to call this in.

38:04.239 --> 38:05.838
LUCIFER: What? No, hold on, Detective.

38:05.907 --> 38:08.374
- You have a choice to make here.
- Yes.

38:08.443 --> 38:10.109
So much punishment.

38:10.178 --> 38:12.045
Mm. Order off-menu for once.

38:12.113 --> 38:14.216
Maze and I certainly won't judge.

38:19.833 --> 38:22.130
You took my father away.

38:23.094 --> 38:26.106
[crying]: You tore apart my family.

38:27.913 --> 38:29.442
- [tape rips]
- [groans]

38:30.799 --> 38:32.532
[chuckles]

38:32.567 --> 38:34.233
I tried to get him to drop it.

38:34.302 --> 38:36.419
But he wouldn't take the hint.

38:36.763 --> 38:38.971
That's all you have to say?

38:39.040 --> 38:40.840
After everything you've done?

38:41.497 --> 38:43.643
No, no, no. No, no, no. I-I'm sorry.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.809
I'll give you all the
players in my operation.

38:45.916 --> 38:47.249
I'll give you money.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.961
[shuddered breathing]

38:56.677 --> 38:57.911
Oh.

39:01.270 --> 39:04.684
We'll see how you do in
the prison that you ran.

39:06.901 --> 39:09.677
I'll bet your inmates
will treat you real nice.

39:10.325 --> 39:13.933
No. No, please, please.

39:13.958 --> 39:15.825
I can get you whatever you want.

39:16.262 --> 39:20.731
All I want is for you to know
that John Decker's kid got you.

39:29.902 --> 39:31.199
[knocks on door]

39:31.593 --> 39:33.098
MAZE [through door]: Linda.

39:34.551 --> 39:36.348
I know you're in there.

39:37.899 --> 39:39.823
I have something to show you.

39:44.093 --> 39:45.784
My first check.

39:46.846 --> 39:48.441
I got paid.

39:48.510 --> 39:50.721
As a bounty hunter!

39:50.854 --> 39:55.481
LAPD paid me this finder's fee
to track down some human scumbag.

39:55.550 --> 39:58.562
Hunting humans is a job.

39:58.587 --> 40:00.420
Who knew?

40:05.960 --> 40:09.406
First thing I wanted to do was
to celebrate with my friend.

40:11.056 --> 40:12.889
That's you, Linda.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.664
Okay.

40:41.453 --> 40:42.656
I just...

40:43.676 --> 40:45.226
wanted you to know.

40:54.242 --> 40:56.000
[door unlocks]

41:00.515 --> 41:03.149
Maze, how can we be friends?

41:05.148 --> 41:06.453
You're a...

41:06.921 --> 41:08.530
you're a demon.

41:09.476 --> 41:12.069
Lucifer's the Devil.

41:13.551 --> 41:15.985
How am I supposed to get over that?

41:18.023 --> 41:20.523
He's still the same old Lucifer.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.802
You're still Dr. Linda Martin.

41:22.871 --> 41:24.704
And I'm still Maze.

41:25.185 --> 41:26.852
What's changed?

41:30.031 --> 41:31.859
Come on.

41:33.109 --> 41:35.882
Let Mazikeen Smith buy you a drink.

- Mmm.

42:00.777 --> 42:02.348
Why should the child go first?

42:02.377 --> 42:04.577
I'm far larger. And hungrier.

42:04.646 --> 42:05.678
It's okay, Mommy.

42:05.747 --> 42:07.713
He must've really wanted it.

Yes.

But... you clearly... care about yours.

Oh. My apologies, Detective.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
