00:48.748 --> 00:51.513
Hey, how much longer till we
get to the mysterious party?

00:51.584 --> 00:53.075
Let me check the spooky

00:53.153 --> 00:56.248
invite sent to us by
our anonymous host.

00:56.322 --> 00:58.314
Oh. We're here.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.620
Party's in that castle.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.101
It's for us!

01:09.169 --> 01:10.831
What's it say?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.338
"Wear me."

01:12.405 --> 01:14.135
"Wear me"?

01:19.145 --> 01:20.204
Hello?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.408
Yoo-hoo!

01:22.482 --> 01:23.415
Hey, guys!

01:23.483 --> 01:25.611
Princess Bubblegum, is that you?

01:25.685 --> 01:27.210
Why, yes, indeed.

01:27.287 --> 01:30.086
Although, according to the
invitation, we're supposed to

01:30.156 --> 01:34.958
use mystery names, and mine
is "Lady Quiet Bottom."

01:35.028 --> 01:38.157
My name is "Duchess Gummybuns."

01:38.231 --> 01:39.790
I am "Professor Pants."

01:39.866 --> 01:41.300
I'm "Cinnamon Bun."

01:41.367 --> 01:43.666
What's the name on your invite?

01:43.736 --> 01:44.601
Oh, yeah.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.800
Uh, it's "Guy Farting."

01:47.874 --> 01:50.776
"Prince Hotbod" at your service.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.040
I'm "Randy Butternubs."

01:54.447 --> 01:56.746
So, who's our host, anyways?

01:56.816 --> 01:58.409
Nobody knows.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.785
Maybe he'll be a steaming-hot
babe with huge money.

02:01.855 --> 02:02.788
Tut, tut,

02:02.856 --> 02:04.085
Lumpy Space Princess.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.422
What would your
boyfriend, Brad, say?

02:06.493 --> 02:08.461
Brad and I broke up
a long time ago.

02:08.527 --> 02:09.527
Duh!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.762
Now's my chance!

02:12.832 --> 02:14.300
No... way!

02:14.367 --> 02:16.461
But I can make you happy.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.596
Puke off, you big doughnut!

02:18.671 --> 02:19.671
Okay.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.237
Excuse me, "Guy Farting,"

02:24.310 --> 02:26.040
there's an envelope
on your back.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.447
Where? Where?

02:28.515 --> 02:29.448
Here... let me.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.849
Did <i>you</i> put that
envelope on him?

02:31.918 --> 02:32.749
No. Nope. - Unh-unh.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.752
I didn't do it. No.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.812
What's it say, "Prince Hotbod"?

02:37.056 --> 02:39.821
"Esteemed Guests,
I am your host.

02:39.893 --> 02:40.893
I am a ghost."

02:41.961 --> 02:45.125
"By the time you finish reading
this, I will possess one of you

02:45.198 --> 02:48.100
and use your body to murder every...
one in the house."

02:49.068 --> 02:50.001
Aah!

02:50.069 --> 02:51.799
We got to get out of here!

02:51.871 --> 02:53.237
C.B., wait.

02:53.306 --> 02:56.208
It says anyone who tries
to leave will die!

02:56.276 --> 02:58.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

02:58.111 --> 02:59.111
Ergh!

03:01.581 --> 03:03.345
He's dead!

03:03.416 --> 03:04.714
Yeah, right.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.845
What do you mean, "Yeah, right"?

03:07.921 --> 03:08.820
Come on.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.323
You don't remember when I
pulled this same trick

03:11.391 --> 03:12.324
on your birthday?

03:12.392 --> 03:13.985
I used the fake skeletons to

03:14.060 --> 03:16.086
make you think
everyone was dead.

03:16.162 --> 03:18.256
It looks real to me.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.924
Psh! Classic move.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.662
Dude, I swear I'm
not pranking you.

03:22.735 --> 03:26.570
Cinnamon Bun is dead.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.108
The question is, who killed him?

03:30.243 --> 03:32.303
One of us is possessed
by a murderer,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.347
and if we want to stay alive,

03:34.414 --> 03:38.078
we have to figure out who's
hiding a ghost inside

03:38.151 --> 03:40.086
their mortal body.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.280
Beemo! - Aah!

03:41.354 --> 03:44.518
Use your ghost-detecting
equipment to screen everyone.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.127
I blinked my balls...
My eyeballs.

03:51.965 --> 03:52.796
Hmm.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.663
What do you mean, "Hmm"?

03:54.734 --> 03:55.565
Nothing.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.695
Did you just see that?

03:57.770 --> 03:58.770
Oh, I knew it.

03:58.805 --> 03:59.864
I knew it was Jake.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.499
Processing data...

04:03.109 --> 04:04.202
- Ew.
- Huh?

04:04.277 --> 04:06.143
So, who's the ghost, Beemo?

04:06.212 --> 04:07.145
Oh.

04:07.213 --> 04:10.411
Um, I don't have
ghost-detecting equipment.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.714
I just like taking
nice pictures.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.378
Let's find some candles.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.649
If the lights go out again,

04:15.722 --> 04:17.452
we'll be able to
catch the murderer.

04:17.523 --> 04:18.422
Good idea.

04:18.491 --> 04:19.868
Jake and Beemo, you
guys check downstairs,

04:19.892 --> 04:21.690
and we'll take this floor.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.889
Okay.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.857
Lay truth on me, Beemo.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.563
Is Finn pulling some
elaborate prank on me?

04:30.637 --> 04:31.570
No, Jake.

04:31.638 --> 04:32.901
When bad things happen,

04:32.972 --> 04:35.908
I know you want to
believe they are a joke.

04:35.975 --> 04:40.276
But sometimes, life
is scary and dark.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.881
That is why we must
find the light.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.212
Aha!

04:44.284 --> 04:45.115
Found it!

04:45.184 --> 04:46.184
Ooh!

04:49.322 --> 04:51.154
Thanks, Beemo.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.248
Beemo?

04:52.325 --> 04:54.191
Help!

04:54.260 --> 04:55.284
Jake, help!

04:55.361 --> 04:56.454
Beemo?

04:56.529 --> 04:57.360
Help!

04:57.430 --> 04:59.058
Aaaaaaaaaah!

04:59.132 --> 05:00.225
Oh, my crease!

05:00.366 --> 05:01.459
Oh, my crease!

05:01.534 --> 05:02.399
Assemble!

05:02.468 --> 05:03.468
Reassemble!

05:03.503 --> 05:04.503
Come on, you guys!

05:04.570 --> 05:05.799
Where's Beemo?

05:05.872 --> 05:07.306
The ghost got him.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.774
Don't you mean <i>you</i> got him...
Ghost?!

05:09.842 --> 05:11.606
You guys, if there really
is a ghost killer,

05:11.678 --> 05:14.580
then we should stay in a group.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.378
He can't take us <i>all</i> on
if we're in a group.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.114
LSP, where are you?!

05:24.190 --> 05:25.123
Are you okay?

05:25.191 --> 05:27.626
It sounds like she's in there.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.220
Aah! I'm dying!

05:32.198 --> 05:33.496
Whew!

05:33.566 --> 05:35.432
Oh, gross. Ugh!

05:35.501 --> 05:37.697
My lumping body's
all hollow now.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.500
I got to put something in it.

05:39.572 --> 05:40.904
So, where's the food?

05:40.973 --> 05:43.033
What kind of castle is this?

05:43.109 --> 05:44.975
It's like a poor
people's castle,

05:45.044 --> 05:48.310
with no lumping waffles
for my dump truck!

05:48.381 --> 05:49.644
Chill out, girl.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.048
You find any candles upstairs?

05:51.117 --> 05:51.948
No.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.362
Well, I dropped a
lighter downstairs,

05:53.386 --> 05:56.879
but there's no way I'm
going back for that.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.015
Uh-huh.

05:58.091 --> 06:01.061
Let me remind y'all
that the invite says

06:01.127 --> 06:03.289
"The ghost will possess
one of our bods."

06:03.363 --> 06:04.490
Not <i>my</i> bod.

06:04.564 --> 06:08.865
Someone at this table isn't
who they appear to be.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.632
That's right... "Jake."

06:11.704 --> 06:15.971
So let me ask you a question
only the <i>real</i> Jake could answer.

06:16.909 --> 06:22.439
Who is always next to me in
my recurring elevator dreams?

06:22.515 --> 06:24.347
A half-orc Shaman.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.283
Okay, you're Jake.

06:26.352 --> 06:29.550
So, who else was absent
when Beemo got nabbed?

06:29.622 --> 06:30.988
Oh, yeah, right.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.286
I'm not the ghost.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.986
I was in the potty house.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.824
A convenient alibi.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.193
But tell me this...

06:37.263 --> 06:39.664
Why did you break up with Brad?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.291
Only the <i>real</i> LSP
would know that.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.426
Pshaw!

06:42.502 --> 06:44.801
As if you even know the
answer to that, Jake!

06:44.871 --> 06:45.964
You're right.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.872
I'm just feeling gossipy, and
I want to know what happened.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.001
That's none of your
lumping business!

06:51.077 --> 06:52.943
Sounds suspicious.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.640
I bet <i>you're</i> the ghost!

06:54.714 --> 06:56.478
She did it!

06:56.549 --> 06:57.744
She's possessed!

06:57.817 --> 06:58.817
Tie her up!

06:58.851 --> 07:00.820
Oh, she <i>is,</i> huh?

07:00.887 --> 07:04.551
Well, before we tie up
LSP, answer me this...

07:05.158 --> 07:07.354
- Brad...
- He kissed me on the mouth,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.362
and I was like, "Bleh!

07:09.429 --> 07:10.429
Bleh! Bleh!"

07:10.463 --> 07:12.159
And then I was like, "Oh, gross!

07:12.231 --> 07:13.392
Go away, Brad!"

07:13.466 --> 07:15.833
And he was like, "Obvi,
you're not ready for me."

07:15.902 --> 07:18.565
But what does that
even mean, you guys?

07:19.539 --> 07:21.405
What does it lumping mean?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.841
But answer me this, Princess...

07:25.912 --> 07:27.938
What do you want from me, Brad?!

07:28.014 --> 07:29.642
You said I was the hottest one!

07:29.715 --> 07:30.774
Isn't that enough?!

07:30.850 --> 07:31.977
Why'd you have to...

07:36.289 --> 07:37.814
What did I write to you

07:37.890 --> 07:40.121
on your "Happy Birthday"
card two years ago?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.661
Word for word.

07:41.727 --> 07:45.061
Finn, there's no way I
would remember that.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.622
I remember that.

07:46.699 --> 07:47.997
You're not PB!

07:48.067 --> 07:49.067
Tie you up!

07:49.869 --> 07:51.132
What?!

07:51.204 --> 07:52.204
Wait, you guys!

07:52.271 --> 07:54.570
Look!

07:56.542 --> 07:58.101
A <i>real</i> ghost?!

07:58.177 --> 07:59.736
Aah! Don't touch me!

07:59.812 --> 08:00.973
Don't touch me!

08:03.182 --> 08:05.344
Da-a-a-a-a-a-g!

08:05.418 --> 08:08.217
This wasn't supposed
to h-h-happen!

08:08.287 --> 08:09.220
Aha!

08:09.288 --> 08:11.757
I knew you were
pranking me back, you!

08:11.824 --> 08:13.520
Yeah, i-it was all a setup...

08:13.593 --> 08:16.688
The doors, Cinnamon
Bun and Beemo.

08:16.762 --> 08:17.695
Oh, Striz!

08:17.763 --> 08:20.790
Beemo and Cinnamon Bun should
be in the closet over there.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.961
Guys! Guys, guys!

08:23.035 --> 08:25.971
Come on, you gu... Aaaaaaah!

08:26.038 --> 08:28.405
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

08:28.474 --> 08:29.339
Oh, my Glob!

08:29.408 --> 08:30.842
I can't take this, you guys.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.106
I'm calling my lumping
parents right now.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.446
Aaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.450
LSP, what's happening?!

08:37.517 --> 08:38.347
Aaaaah!

08:38.417 --> 08:40.477
Oh, my glob! I'm not ready!

08:40.553 --> 08:41.782
Get away!

08:41.854 --> 08:42.947
Oh, gross!

08:43.022 --> 08:45.355
Aaaaaaah!

08:45.424 --> 08:47.984
Where did she go?!

08:48.060 --> 08:49.858
Look!

08:49.929 --> 08:51.921
I'm scared, Bro.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.405
Run, homey! Run!

09:02.675 --> 09:03.870
Open it!

09:05.111 --> 09:06.272
It won't open!

09:06.345 --> 09:07.345
Muh! Aah!

09:09.615 --> 09:11.641
Whoooooo!

09:11.717 --> 09:12.548
Aaaaah!

09:12.618 --> 09:14.780
Oof!

09:14.854 --> 09:15.981
Come on!

09:16.055 --> 09:18.456
Okay.

09:18.524 --> 09:19.753
Oh! Jake!

09:19.825 --> 09:21.191
Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:21.260 --> 09:22.421
I got a splinter!

09:22.495 --> 09:23.588
Jakey!

09:23.663 --> 09:24.995
Whaaa!

09:25.064 --> 09:26.589
Don't let go, man!

09:26.666 --> 09:28.032
Oh, no!

09:28.100 --> 09:29.625
Your fancy glo-o-o-o-ves!

09:29.702 --> 09:31.227
Aaaaaaah!

09:33.806 --> 09:34.637
Unh!

09:34.707 --> 09:35.902
Jake!

09:35.975 --> 09:37.500
Princess!

09:43.215 --> 09:44.410
Ugh!

09:44.483 --> 09:45.883
Ugh!

09:45.952 --> 09:46.851
Ugh!

09:46.919 --> 09:49.115
Unh!

10:03.769 --> 10:05.738
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

10:06.973 --> 10:08.601
Ha-haaa!

10:08.674 --> 10:10.006
Gotcha, dude!

10:10.076 --> 10:11.305
Two for two.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.377
What?!

10:12.445 --> 10:16.405
I figured out your plan months
ago, so I flipped the script.

10:16.482 --> 10:17.415
Oh, yeah!

10:17.483 --> 10:19.247
So everyone's okay...

10:19.318 --> 10:20.581
Beemo, Cinnamon Bun?

10:20.653 --> 10:21.848
Yeah. See?

10:21.921 --> 10:23.150
Whoa! Sick!

10:23.222 --> 10:25.521
You can phase people
into your body?

10:28.995 --> 10:31.521
I'm ready for you now, Brad.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.065
Isn't that Obvi?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.361
I'm so ready.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.868
But, PB, you melted.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.132
It was a wax dummy, Dummy.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.936
Jake switched me out while
lady was distracting you.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.601
Wow. You got me again.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.304
I can't believe that... With the

10:45.378 --> 10:47.244
hair and the house
coming alive and stuff.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.508
The what?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.743
The walls and chairs trying
to eat me and stuff.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.045
Eh, no.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.020
You must have been so scared,
you imagined that part.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.885
Um... no, I didn't.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.152
Ha ha. Nice try, Finn.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.558
Let's get out of here.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.696
That one's going in the vault.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.671
And...

11:13.806 --> 11:14.806
It's gone.
