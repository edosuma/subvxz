00:28.862 --> 00:31.281


00:33.700 --> 00:36.244


00:38.413 --> 00:40.540


00:42.584 --> 00:44.878
Mabel. You ain't gonna believe this.

00:44.961 --> 00:45.795
Yeah, yeah.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.466
You won't believe this. Look here.
Look at what Brown's doing.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.383
What he doin'?

00:50.467 --> 00:54.679
He gettin' ready to burn down
the whole damn neighborhood.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.807
Go out there and tell him
that's too much damn lighter fluid.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.100
What's wrong with Brown?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.435
I ain't finna go out there.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.187
He's getting ready
to start a chemical fire.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.855
You think I wanna be in a chemical fire?

01:03.938 --> 01:06.691
That happened to me
in 1972 when I was on that oil rig.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.068
Burned up all my gonads.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.988
Joe, if he burn down the damn house,
where you gonna live?

01:13.073 --> 01:16.910
Under that big-ass dress
with the rest of them critters.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.621
You know, I don't know
why the hell I let you live in my house.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.415
'Cause you can't afford
to stay here by your damn self.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.125
You wanna bet? You know what I'mma do?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.961
I'mma take you upstairs and put you
in one of them trunks in the attic

01:27.045 --> 01:29.172
and let your ass
dry rot and get your check

01:29.255 --> 01:31.883
till them white folk
figure out what the hell happened to you.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.469
You right. I'mma go on out there.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.931
Joe, you better get on outta here,
do what I tell you to do up in my house.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.682
Hell, I gotta be up in here cooking

01:39.766 --> 01:42.143
like I'm damn Aunt Jemima
or somebody for this boy

01:42.227 --> 01:43.353
-Brown?
-Huh?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.481
-The hell you doin'?
-I'm makin' a fire.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.235
See, I'm gonna make this big for
my great-grandson's graduation barbecue.

01:50.318 --> 01:53.738
If you gonna make smoked ribs,
you got to make a big fire.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.324
You 'bout to kill your damn…
You 'bout to kill your damn self.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.909
No, Joe. If you make it like--

01:57.992 --> 02:01.121
This how you make holy meat.
You ever made holy meat?

02:01.204 --> 02:03.748
If you gonna do that, you got to have
a fire like a fiery furnace.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.918
-That's what you gotta do.
-Brown, you gettin' ready to k--

02:07.001 --> 02:08.378
Lucky you didn't mess up my damn--

02:08.461 --> 02:10.463
Are you puttin' gasoline?
You lost your damn mind.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.381
This how you make it.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.675
If you ain't gonna come and help,
just go in the house.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.593
Okay. Great, great. I'mma help you.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.762
-You got a match?
-Yes. Here's a match.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.222
-Thank you.
-Do me a favor.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.473
-What?
-Praise the Lord.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.559
-Praise the Lord.
-Don't light it until I get inside.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.893
-Okay, okay.
-Here you go.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.436
-Give me that, Joe.
-Okay.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.772
This how you make meat.
You gotta have your smoke wet.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.858
Taste it on your finger like that, Joe.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.527
-Mabel!
-It just need a little more.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.988
I just wanna ask you something.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.615
I know you want barbecue ribs,
barbecue pork and beans,

02:37.699 --> 02:41.119
barbecue all that stuff
for this boy's graduation party,

02:41.202 --> 02:44.247
but do you have any room
for a roasted nigga?

02:44.330 --> 02:47.125
-What?
-He about to--

02:48.835 --> 02:50.003
The hell?

02:51.754 --> 02:53.423
What I tell ya? He on fire.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.135
He on-- He on fire.
He on fire.

02:57.218 --> 03:00.555
-Hey, hey, boy, hey.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.308
This motherfucker is actually on fire.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.852
He on fire.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.104
The hell wrong with you?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.857
-I'm burning!
-Hold on. Hold on. I'm comin'.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.528
Okay, I'mma put him out.

03:17.906 --> 03:18.990
The hell?

03:19.073 --> 03:22.035
I told your dumb ass not to get over
that flame with that lighter fluid.

03:22.118 --> 03:26.748
-Brown? Brown? Oh hell. Brown?
-Help me!

03:26.831 --> 03:28.666
-Oh hell!

03:28.750 --> 03:31.336
-Help, I'm burning!
-Gonna burn up my tree.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.046
You worried about a tree?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.256
-One of y'all put me out! Joe!

03:35.340 --> 03:36.591
-Catch his ass.
-Get him.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.176
I got a light though.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.762
-Yo, trip him, trip him.
-I got it.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.474
Joe!

03:44.974 --> 03:45.850
Help!

03:48.978 --> 03:50.730
You gonna buy me another damn tree.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.650
Mabel, nobody gonna buy no tree.
I'm burnin' over here.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.110
I hope you don't keloid, Brown.
It's all right.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.112
I just planted this tree.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.866
-Shit! I gotta pay the water bill.
-Help.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.493
Hush your mouth, hell.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.661
Help.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.412
Help!

04:06.913 --> 04:07.789
Get him up.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.296
Can you believe we're graduating?

04:15.380 --> 04:18.841
Yes, I can, man.
That was a lot of hard work.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.093
Well, you aced it.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.177
And so did you.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.055
I did okay,
but you were the valedictorian.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.974
Hey, that's right.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.269
-Ah!

04:29.894 --> 04:32.605
Let's get to your great-grandma's house.
All right, let's go.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.983
Hey, look, what is the rush, man?
Look, we…

04:35.483 --> 04:39.112
Dinner's not till seven.
We will get there. It will be great.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.907
I don't know what the rush is,
but I know what the delay is.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.410
-You don't wanna tell them.
-No, I don't.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.162
I don't wanna pressure you into this,
but it's 2021.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.081
We graduate in two days. They should know.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.959
I know, dude, I know. It's just that like…

04:53.459 --> 04:55.920
Look, my family is different, okay?

04:56.004 --> 04:56.921
Look at my family.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.632
My father is West Indian,
my mother is from Ireland,

04:59.716 --> 05:02.302
and I grew up in the Netherlands,
until my dad passed.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.387
And because my mom
had passed years earlier,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.639
I moved to Ireland
to live with my great-aunt Agnes

05:06.723 --> 05:09.142
until I came here to go
to a historically Black college.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.602
Now who's the one with the family
with the different opinions?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.563
-Yeah.
-It's Davi for the win.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.232
-You win. You win on that. You're right.
-Thank you.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.192
I do look forward to meeting them someday.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.194
Well, yeah. Well, let's not rush that.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.991
Mmm. So… so I can confront my family,

05:25.074 --> 05:27.785
but you can't confront
your great-aunt Agnes? Is that what I got?

05:27.869 --> 05:31.205
No, that's a completely different story
because I feel like your mom

05:31.289 --> 05:33.291
is really open-minded,
so she will be okay with this.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.208
-I know it.
-Ah.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.377
Okay, yeah, but my dad will not be.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.004
Well, to hell with your dad.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.215
Davi, why do you hate my dad so much?

05:41.299 --> 05:44.093
You really have to ask?
After all he did to you and your mom?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.679
See, you know, that's why
I'm not telling you nothin' else.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.014
You don't forget nothing.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.975
Look… …he will be there tonight.

05:51.059 --> 05:55.063
So please, whatever you do,
do not get into it with him.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.940
Okay? Good?

05:58.441 --> 06:01.361
-It's hot out here today.
-I know, Cora. I was hotter.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.445
You was hotter?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.238
You ain't gonna
believe what happened.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.325
Brown tried to go all rotisserie
on us and shit.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.743
-Uncle Joe.
-What? Hell.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.703
Cora, I don't wanna go to hell.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.538
Hell, no. I don't wanna go.

06:12.622 --> 06:16.334
Cora, I was lighting that fire to make
the barbecue for my… my famous chicken,

06:16.417 --> 06:18.044
and boom, it got me, girl.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.338
-What?
-I feel bad for them chickens.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.507
-I feel bad.
-Chickens? What are you talkin' about?

06:22.590 --> 06:24.050
Set hisself on fire.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.803
He gonna be a jigga now.
He ain't finna eat no more chicken.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.346
-Yes--
-He put gasoline on--

06:28.429 --> 06:30.181
-What?
-He put everything on the grill--

06:30.264 --> 06:32.308
Thought I was makin' it big, Joe.
I was makin' it big.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
-Wait a minute now--
-Well, your ass got burned big, big-time.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.437
Are you all right?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.481
Oh, yes. Thank you so much
for asking, baby.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.608
I'm good, but my knee
been bothering me a little bit.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.443
I gotta go to a doctor
and get it looked at.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.487
Uncle Joe, I'm talking to Mr. Brown.
Are you okay?

06:44.570 --> 06:48.783
Ah, Cora, yes, I'm… Well, yes and no.
I'm not fine. It's like I went to hell.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.285
-You went--
-Yes, I went to hell, and Madea was there.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.913
And I said, "This definitely not
the right place for me."

06:55.331 --> 06:56.416
-Ooh.
-Here.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.501
Now you wanna bring him some damn water.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.961
-Yeah.
-Joe, shut the hell up.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.754
I done burnt up already.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.172
Hey, Cora. How you doin', baby?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.175
-Hey, Madea. Can you take this bag?
-Ooh, girl, I like that green dress.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.678
I'm not gonna take nothing.
I like the dress though.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.138
Aw, Madea, you can take this bag.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.931
What the hell I look like to you,
a bellman?

07:12.014 --> 07:14.517
Yeah, well, you look like
two or three bellmans if you ask me.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.477
-She look like bells-men.
-Would y'all--

07:16.561 --> 07:17.770
She… she look like horsepower.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.606
Say somethin' else, Joe.
Just shut up. Shut up while you livin'.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.983
Shut up while you got your nuts.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.569
Please, please shut up.
I'll put 'em in that nutcracker.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.279
-Oh, Lord.
-Oh, Joe.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.031
Madea, now look, I went to the store
to get everything we needed.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.784
You could just hold this bag.
I had to drive way across town.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.619
I know you had to drive
way across town, Cora.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.872
Every time I go to the store,
something done burned down

07:35.955 --> 07:37.832
or boarded up
'cause people protesting all over.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.749
I don't understand

07:38.833 --> 07:40.626
why they didn't burn up
the whole neighborhood.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.712
We don't need that store.
We need to burn everything

07:42.795 --> 07:44.672
in the neighborhood down.
Burn it all down.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.549
Joe, what kind of sense it make to burn up

07:46.632 --> 07:49.385
your own damn neighborhood
'cause you upset about something?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.513
What the hell kind of sense it make
what these police doin' to Black people?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.849
-Burn it all down.
-Oh, I'mma… I'm finna punch him.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.311
Well, I'm just glad they didn't burn down
the church 'cause it's in the same block.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.230
You know that's right, Cora.
Thank God that church did not burn down.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.690
-Hallelujer.
-Yes.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.941
-Hallelujer.
-Yes!

08:04.025 --> 08:06.110
Hallelujer, thank God
that church didn't burn down.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.154
Madea, I'm so glad
you standin' up for the church.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.071
That's beautiful.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.199
-I don't care nothin' about that church.
-What?

08:11.282 --> 08:13.326
It's just right next door
to my favorite liquor store.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.828
So, you more concerned
about the liquor store than the church?

08:15.912 --> 08:16.871
That's wrong, Madea.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.956
Nothing's wrong.
Here's what you don't understand.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.125
-Jesus, the Lord God Almighty…
-Uh-huh.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.710
He can turn water into wine.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.628
-He did.
-Yes, he did.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.421
I got to go
to the liquor store to get mine.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.257
Won't somebody praise Him?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.967
What? You need to stop that foolishness.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.053
Come on, Madea,
we gotta get started on this dinner.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.347
That's all right, Cora.
We'll go to Red Lobster tonight,

08:34.430 --> 08:36.265
and we come back here tomorrow
for the barbecue.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.852
Yeah, oh, I like Red Lobster, yeah.
That's where me and B go all the time.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.812
Oh, B? Who is B?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.773
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.985
-Give me that bag. Let's go in the house.
-Is it me, or is Mabel drawing bugs?

08:48.069 --> 08:51.113
Would you stop that? I need y'all
to go get the stuff out the car.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.865
Go on, get the stuff out the car.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.326
-We can get started on this.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.494
All right.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.828
Hurry up and get the stuff out--

08:57.912 --> 09:00.206
Mr. Brown, what is goin' on
with the back of your clothes?

09:00.289 --> 09:01.707
All your behind is out.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.292
Cora, I thought I felt a breeze.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.878
It must've been when I burnt, Cora.
Can you see anything?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.213
I see everything.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.967
-Can you see anything, Cora?
-Yes. You need to cover yourself up.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.636
You got all kinda hair back…
You need to shave that.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.972
-Cora, can you see?
-Look like a baboon back there.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.598
-Cora, you see?
-Lord have mercy.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.850
Yes, I see it. It looks terrible.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.520
I don't know how the hell

09:22.603 --> 09:24.105
-At church--
-Get the groceries.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.732
-I'll get the bags.
-Take 'em all around to the backyard.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.486
Okay. Joe, you didn't…
Why you didn't tell me my butt was out?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.114
I… I been trying not to look
at that ugly mother…

09:33.197 --> 09:34.073
Okay.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.618
Well, come to think of it,
I have done a couple mothers.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.454
Hey, what you keep bending over…

09:40.538 --> 09:41.872
I'm trying to get the stuff, Joe.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.251
You 'bout to make me throw the damn up.
I'm about to throw the damn up.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.045
Well, just get the chairs
and put all the chairs up.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.214
You move the chair. I can't look at you.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.632
-You ain't got--
-Hush, hush, hush.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.384
-What?
-Hush, hush, hush, hush.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.136
Ooh, smells Cajun back here.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.554
-Hey.
-What y'all cooking? Hey!

09:56.637 --> 09:59.181
-Hey there, baby. How you doin'?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.766
Uh, hello,

10:00.850 --> 10:04.186

10:04.270 --> 10:07.398
-Uh, I'm Mr. Brown, and I'm a… a…

10:07.481 --> 10:09.233

-Oh, he's a Leo.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.694
-How you doin', Mr. Brown and Mr. Joe?
-Depend on--

10:11.777 --> 10:13.487
Wait, you know my name?

10:13.571 --> 10:14.989
Of course.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.657
Yes, this is Sylvia.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.411
Oh, that's right, baby. I'm so sorry.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.830
-No.
-Oh no. No, no. Super Bowl?

10:22.913 --> 10:25.833
All-Star Weekend.
You sexy as hell. What's your name?

10:25.916 --> 10:28.127
-Okay, I'm sick to the stomach.
-Joe.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.838
I wish… I was a mirror

10:30.921 --> 10:34.050
so I can see myself
inside of you.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.719
-Is he serious?
-I wish you would stop that.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.637
-Joe.
-Huh?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.680
-That's your grandniece.
-What is happening?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.098
That's kin to you.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.225
My grandniece?
What the hell is a grandniece?

10:43.309 --> 10:46.479
I'm from Alabama.
After daughter, it don't damn matter.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.065
-When you get to cousin, you good.
-Oh Lord.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.233
That's just terr… Joe, that's ridiculous.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.028
-Y'all go in the house.
-I'm not here for this incest.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.113
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.367
Go on. Ooh, go in there.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.578
Damn, look at you walking like…

11:02.662 --> 11:04.997
Damn, Brown! Hell! Shit!

11:05.081 --> 11:05.915
What?

11:05.998 --> 11:06.916
Shit.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.876
-Hey!

11:08.959 --> 11:10.378
Hey, look at her.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.797
Look at this. Hey, babe, how you been?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.507
-Hi!
-Good to see you.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.716
Sit down, Sylvia.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.468
-Oh, thank you.
-Sit down.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.470
You look so good. Both of y'all look good.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.389
-Thank you.
-Did y'all ride together?

11:21.472 --> 11:25.434
Yes. I told her I was fine,
but she insisted on picking me up.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.937
You know I didn't want you
on the road in that old car alone.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.896
-That's sweet.
-Thanks.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.481
-That is so sweet.
-I got you.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.108
There's nothing like a good girlfriend…

11:32.191 --> 11:33.025
That's right.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.402
…to look out for you.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.904
-That's so sweet.
-Thank you for letting me stay here.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.280
Oh, you're so welcome.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.450
You can come here
anytime you want, day or night.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.578
Long as you don't stay too long.
You leavin' right after graduation, right?

11:44.662 --> 11:45.746
Ma--

11:45.830 --> 11:48.332
-Yeah.
-Okay, good. Just right after, right?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.751
-As soon as it's over, y'all going home.
-Madea!

11:50.835 --> 11:52.086
Oh, is Ellie here?

11:52.169 --> 11:54.839
Oh, well, she called
and said that she was on her way,

11:54.922 --> 11:56.924
but she's gettin' off work.
She just got off duty.

11:57.007 --> 12:00.761
Okay. I worry about my sister
being a cop with all that's goin' on.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.139
Me too, sweetheart. I worry about her.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.724
-Know what I worry about?
-What?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.684
-I worry about her comin' up in here.
-Why?

12:06.767 --> 12:09.478
With all these damn warrants I got,
every time I see her, I be worried.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.564
I be like, "Baby don't come up in here."

12:11.647 --> 12:13.649
"I wanna hug you, but don't frisk me."

12:13.733 --> 12:16.527
I know that's your daughter,
but Lord have mercy, Cora. Mm-mm.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.990
-Well, she just be looking out for you.
-No, no. I… I got too many warrants.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.576
Sylvia's a lawyer.
She can help you out with that.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.493
Yeah.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.829
Last time Brown tried to help me,
I went down to court,

12:26.912 --> 12:29.039
they told me that I had to, uh… uh, pay a…

12:29.123 --> 12:30.833
What they call… what they call…
Oh, a fine.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.168
-I gotta pay a fine.
-Oh.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.587
I'm like, "You want me
to pay a fine to get a driving license

12:34.670 --> 12:36.088
so I can get insurance?"

12:36.172 --> 12:37.506
"After I done bought my damn car?"

12:37.590 --> 12:41.802
Hell, no, I'm not finna to pay a fine, my…
No. We not do… we don't pay no fines.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.721
They gotta catch me first.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.765
You getting too old for that, Madea.

12:45.848 --> 12:49.351
Sometimes you gotta get
some thrills in your life. Do crazy stuff.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.687
I don't wanna die old and…
That's what's keeping me young.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.189
-Running from the police.
-What?

12:53.272 --> 12:54.690
-Yes.
-Is that the trick?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.902
-Yes. That keep your heart strong.
-Don't listen to her.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.987
-You be like this all the time.
-Don't listen.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.239
-You been teaching me wrong.
-Don't you listen to that.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.909
-I need some warrants and tennis shoes.
-That's right. That's right.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.787
No, but I called Tim,
and he said he's on his way as well.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.747
-Yes, my grandbaby.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.792
My baby is graduating.
Oh my God. Can you believe that?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.668
Oh, he said
he wants to tell us an announcement

13:14.752 --> 13:16.754
in front of the whole family
while he here so…

13:16.837 --> 13:19.548
-What you think it is?
-I have no idea, but…

13:19.632 --> 13:22.718
Whatever it is, you know it's good news.
We all know Tim's a great kid.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.179
-His mama did a good job.
-Yes, you did.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.514
In spite of that daddy.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.808
Ooh, baby, don't talk about him.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.393
Speaking of that,
how you doin' after that divorce?

13:31.477 --> 13:34.188
-Lord have mercy.
-Yes, 'cause we know it was bad.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.648
-I'm fine.
-That's good.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.316
-You sure?
-I'm really good. I am.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.236
No, 'cause after that divorce,
you was just looking… …bad.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.278
-Madea!
-What?

13:41.362 --> 13:44.698
-She was just looking… …bad.
-Yeah, 'cause we know it was bad.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.617
I'm good. I really am.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.661
Sylvia, she represented me,

13:48.744 --> 13:51.497
and without her I don't know
where or what I would be right now.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.582
Well, I just wish
I could've gotten you more.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.669
What'd I tell you? I told you she
wasn't gonna be able to do right by you.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.670
What do you mean?

13:57.753 --> 14:00.506
How she gonna do right by her
when she going through the court system?

14:00.589 --> 14:02.758
If you go through the court,
they tell you what to do.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.011
How the hell a judge gonna make
a decision on what you could and can't do?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.389
Hell no to the judge.
I ain't going with the judge.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.308
You should've come to me.
I'd have got you half of everything.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.853
I'd have got you half of the sofa--
Ask somebody.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.313
In 2004, I took a chainsaw to some shit.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.190
-You better ask somebody.
-I know that's right.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.276
There's the legal way,
then there's the Madea way.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.819
That's right. That's right.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.239
Right, exactly. Don't follow her tr--
Don't do that. Don't do that.

14:25.322 --> 14:29.243
Oh, sorry. But you look like this divorce
is not affecting you at all, sweetie.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.036
-I'm so happy for you.
-Unbothered.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.706
-That's right. You look so good.
-No.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.374
-But she do look good.
-No.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.543
-What?
-You look good, but some… Mm-mm.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.878
Uh-uh what?

14:38.961 --> 14:42.256
Baby, after somebody had a divorce,
and they go through a bad, rough time,

14:42.339 --> 14:45.134
and they start looking this good,
they usually done found somethin' else.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.470
When you're trying to get over something,
they slip under a man with legs wide open.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.764
-Madea!
-Cora, I can say what I wanna say.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.268
All that money I spent helping that girl
pay for that boy to go through college.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.311
"All that money"?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.854
Yes, I spent…

14:56.937 --> 14:57.897
What? How much was…

14:57.980 --> 15:00.232
-I got to go… I got to add it up.
-Please add it up.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.737
It was $37.95, is what I sent to you
to help put that boy through school.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.280
What's she gonna do with $37?

15:06.363 --> 15:08.866
Ain't about where it come from.
It's what you had to do to get it.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.242
-I see.
-So y'all come on.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.244
Listen, we get some stuff
ready for tomorrow.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.289
You sit here, baby. You look so pretty.
Y'all get them 'matoes ready.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.499
-Help your mama.
-I'm slicing them.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.918
Go on, get that ready.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.128
-You're right.
-I'm gonna slice these tomatoes.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.671
Hey.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.548
-Hey.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.507
Mama.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.093
Oh, my baby. My baby!

15:28.177 --> 15:30.095
-Look at them.
-How you doin'?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.097
-Hey.
-It's so good to see you.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.349
Look at my baby.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.683
-Good to see y'all.
-Come in.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.727
-Hi.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.355
-Hey.
-Hi, Mama.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.941
They look good.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.944
That's my baby. The graduate.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
Let them take a picture.
Go take a picture.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.033
Uh! Valedictorian.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.284
-Yes!

15:53.160 --> 15:55.955
Hi, I'm so glad that you're here, Sylvia.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.165
And thank you
for all that you did for her.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.502
Will you stop it?
Y'all do not have to keep thanking me.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.753
I do, though.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.297
Tim, boy, I am so proud of you.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.592
I mean, all that money we spent
puttin' you through school.

16:08.676 --> 16:12.096
-You better do something with yourself.
-I do. I will. I promise.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.639
You better.

16:13.722 --> 16:14.848
I believe you now.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.100
You remember my friend Davi?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.935
-"Davi"? His name Davi?
-Yes.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.771
I been calling that baby Davey.
I… I'm so sorry.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.025
-Good to see you, Laura.
-It's good to see you too.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.778
I got a question.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.155
-What is it?
-Why all these Negroes in this house?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.490
-Is this a homicide?
-No--

16:31.573 --> 16:32.616
Y'all need to go home.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.036
Uncle Joe, watch your mouth.
Did y'all finish everything outside?

16:36.120 --> 16:39.415
I did the best I could.
I couldn't look at Brown's ass no more,

16:39.498 --> 16:40.666
so I sent him home.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.127
Brown went home
to wash the soot off his ass.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.964
-Uh, I think it was soot.
-No, Joe, I don't know if that was soot.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.175
I've known Brown a long time.
They call him Brown for a reason.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.927
-Oh my Lord.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.095
Oh Lord.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.223
Hey, Uncle Joe.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.394
I know damn well
you ain't come in here in that uniform.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.896
My baby can wear
her uniform if she wants.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.858
She's an officer,
and I'm so proud of you, baby.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.484
Thank you, Mama.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.861
You're welcome, sweetheart.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.572
You the reason everybody getting
to the end of the damn street

17:11.655 --> 17:13.782
and backing up and turning around.
That's 'cause of you.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.950
That's what they do here.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.119
They'll back up in a minute
when they see a police car.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.622
Tear up damn light poles, everything
to get away. You better ask me. I know.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.207
You need to take that uniform off

17:22.291 --> 17:25.002
and move that police car before you have
everybody in this neighborhood

17:25.085 --> 17:27.796
trying to kill somebody 'cause you
in the neighborhood. Get outta here.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.798
I am not moving, Uncle Joe.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.802
If my weed man can't get here to give me
my weed, we gonna have a problem.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.472
Freddy coming over?
Tell him to get me about four--

17:39.308 --> 17:42.102
-I'll tell you later.
-So you need to move that police car.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.438
You know, I… I can actually arrest you.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.566
And I'll protest all over your ass.
I'll protest all over your ass.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.525
What for?

17:48.609 --> 17:52.863
Violation of my civil right
on January 6th on the US Capitol.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.156
That I can smoke weed

17:54.239 --> 17:55.365
if the weed is right.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.493
-What?
-Tell your weed man to come see me.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.577
What you gonna do?

17:58.660 --> 18:01.455
-Bring him on over.
-Don't be threatening my weed man.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.083
-I'll show you what--
-Threatening my weed man.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.628
But, Uncle Joe, you would be
in the wrong. Weed is illegal here.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.588
I got a subscription.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.091
Uh, I… I think
you mean prescription, right?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.259
-Right. Right.
-Who… who the hell is that?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.970
-That's Tim.
-The educated one who we're celebrating.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.764
Don't correct him. He's stupid.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.184
I know what I said. Don't correct me
'cause you went to college.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.269
I know what I'm saying.
I got a subscription.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.562
Valedictorian.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.732
Well, valedict your ass out of here
before you get kicked in it.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.359
What is wrong with you?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.861
Now, you move that damn car right now.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.323
I am not.
And tell your weed man, come see me.

18:37.741 --> 18:41.161
You know what I'm gonna do?
If I count my joint, and I'm running low,

18:41.245 --> 18:44.790
and I run out
'cause you here in your uniform, we… we…

18:44.873 --> 18:47.292
-We gonna have a problem.
-You know what?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.669
-I'mma go change…
-Okay.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.462
…before I have to arrest somebody.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.964
I'm so sorry.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.258
-So that's my Uncle Joe.
-Yes, that's Uncle Joe.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.468
Come on, watch… watch this. Uncle Joe?

18:56.552 --> 18:57.469
What?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.012
How you doin'?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.683
Uh, fair to middlin'.
Nuts don't work, but they still trying.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.144
They'll crank out a little
now and then to make her happy.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.229
Okay… Uh, I didn't need to know that.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.481
What the hell you ask me for
if you didn't want to know?

19:09.565 --> 19:10.524
-Fair enough.
-Okay.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.860
-This is my friend Davi.
-Hello, sir.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.445
Get your hand away.
You ain't heard of COVID-1920.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.322
I tried to tell you.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.410
Why… why you… why you talk so funny?

19:21.493 --> 19:22.995
I'm from Europe.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.873
Oh, you're from Europe?
That why your pants so tight?

19:26.373 --> 19:28.792
What? Son, I can see your camel toe.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.630
-This is what our generation's wearing.
-What your generation is wearin'. I see.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.009
Your generation
is turning nuts into nutmeg. Just powder.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.928
Back in the day, we had nuts.
We had balls. We had sacks.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.890
Now everybody just got powder.
Y'all ain't got no balls.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.642
Y'all, everybody woke.
Y'all need to go back to sleep.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.478
All right. Would you leave
my roommate alone, please?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.190
Oh, your… Oh, he's your roommate?

19:51.273 --> 19:53.650
-Yeah. Yeah.
-We share a dorm room on campus.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.612
Your uncle Peaches
shared a dorm room on camper too.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.408
It was about, uh, 40 years he shared
that dorm room with that dude on camper.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.203
He liked them tight britches.
He had a camel toe too.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.121
Joe, leave them damn children alone.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.332
Y'all get up and bring
them bags upstairs for your mama.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.917
Don't be talking to that fool.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.002
Go on upstairs. Get the bag right there.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.337
-Okay.
-Bring it upstairs.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.838
Don't… don't hurt yourself.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.673
Don't break your fingernail.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.009
Don't strain your camel toe.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.345
The hell is wrong with them?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.597
Hootie-hoo!

20:23.680 --> 20:24.556
Oh, that Bam.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.099
Oh yeah. Hey, everybody.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.143
-Hey! Good to see you, Bam.
-Hi.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.646
Good to see you too.
I wanna sit down. I'm sore.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.316
-Sit down right here.
-Oh, thank you for coming today, Aunt Bam.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.860
Thank you for the invite.
We gonna be out here?

20:36.944 --> 20:39.112
-I'm gonna sit here then.
-Yeah, rest yourself.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.781
Oh yes!

20:40.864 --> 20:43.408
Oh, I knew she was gonna be here.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.702
-Hey, Syl. Look at you, girl.
-Hey, Miss Bam.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.580
-Still pretty. Yeah, you still pretty…
-Yeah.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.251
Still nasty too.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.711
-And you wear it so well.
-Yes. Thank you.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.046
All of y'all was pretty.

20:56.129 --> 20:59.549
-Even your mama was pretty.
-Yes, she was, but she was a ho.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.344
-She was.
-Just saying. It ain't my business.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.555
Uh, somebody here invited a man.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.556
Ooh.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.101
Ooh, that new man you're seeing?

21:09.184 --> 21:11.144
No. Too new to invite him.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.439
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Laura.

21:14.523 --> 21:18.151
-You seein' somebody, baby?
-No, she's talkin' about Richard.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.946
What?  Madea, just calm down.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.156
Uh-uh. You back with him?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.241
Oh, absolutely not.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.952
-But he is Tim's father.
-That's right.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.246
And Tim wanted him there,
so I said, "Yes."

21:29.329 --> 21:31.540
No, ma'am. Did anybody think to ask me?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.125
-This is my damn house.
-Madea--

21:33.208 --> 21:34.710
You gonna let that man come up in here?

21:34.793 --> 21:38.422
That boy left you broke and had nothing.
And I was having to take care of you.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.841
I gave you $37
to help put that boy through school.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.302
You let him come in my house
when he ain't do nothing for you?

21:43.385 --> 21:45.887
-Madea, you--
-He better keep his ass away from me.

21:45.971 --> 21:50.392
Y'all better keep his ass away from me.
That's all I'm saying.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.310
I'm sorry.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.894
Oh yes. Ooh.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.688
Wait. I thought you was tired.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.816
Shut up.

21:57.899 --> 21:58.775
-Tim?
-Huh?

21:58.859 --> 21:59.776
So,

22:00.277 --> 22:03.947
who is this right here, Tim?
Looking like a snack.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.991
-Bam.
-Aunt Bam.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.619
Ellie, leave me alone.
You know I like 'em fine and little.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.164
-Hi, I'm Davi.
-You Da-- Oh.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.665
And… and he French.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.042
-What?
-Davi.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.544
-I'm Irish and Dutch.

22:18.128 --> 22:22.049
Dutch?
Well, you can be my lucky charm anytime.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.676
-Bam.
-And I'll be your double Dutch.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.387
-Who the hell left the gate open?

22:27.471 --> 22:28.555
Joe!

22:28.638 --> 22:32.184
That's the corniest shit I ever heard.
I thought I had some corny lines.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.269
You better watch her. She… she…

22:34.936 --> 22:37.272
Oh, never mind.
Y'all ain't gotta be careful.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.816
Never mind. Never mind.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.402
-Uncle Joe.
-All right, now. Come on.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.364
Close the damn door!
Got the air conditioner, everything.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.824
Boy comin' out the damn house.
Close the door!

22:47.908 --> 22:50.118
Joe, shut up.
You don't pay no bill no way.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.119
Y'all go ahead.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.122
-We gotta get ready for dinner. All right?
-Okay.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.124
Well, all right then, see y'all.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.210
Bam, where you goin'?

22:58.794 --> 23:01.505
I am going in here to my future.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.506
Oh, well…

23:02.589 --> 23:03.715
To your future?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.258
Baby, let her go. She high as hell.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.469
-I ain't got no time for y'all.
-What?

23:08.136 --> 23:10.389
I don't know what y'all sittin' here
looking at me for.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.390
Tim?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.600
-Who that?
-Oh, Tim?

23:13.683 --> 23:15.268
-Oh Lord.
-Auntie?

23:15.352 --> 23:16.436
-Oh.
-Hey.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.562
-Hey, Tim.
-Hey.

23:17.646 --> 23:21.650
Hey, Tim. Congratulations, baby.
That's for you.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.776
Thank you.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.320
-Oh, ain't no money in it.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.198
He opened it like there was
some money in it, didn't he?

23:28.281 --> 23:29.991
-I was ready.

23:30.075 --> 23:35.205
But if I could, I would've folded myself
up in there for you as your gift.

23:35.288 --> 23:38.250
Bam. you couldn't fold
yourself up in a pickup truck.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.586
You may wanna ask
your daddy how I folds up.

23:41.670 --> 23:45.090
Oh yeah. He would know.
My daddy was a pimp.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.387
What you batting your eyes
and fixing your hair for?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.889
You bark…
Bam, you barking up the wrong trees.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.434
Tapping you out. Be quiet.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.768
Hush, haterer.

23:57.269 --> 24:01.022
So, guys, you think
I could fit right here?

24:01.106 --> 24:02.149
-Well…
-I think I can.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.608
-I wanna see this.
-I think I can.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.861
I may be able to.
I'll put that right here.

24:05.944 --> 24:06.778
Okay.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.196
-Look at that.
-Yeah.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.281
I got down there.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.909
Squoze right on in there,
didn't I?

24:12.993 --> 24:15.829
Just like an apple trying
to get through the eye of a needle.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.582
Listen,
don't… don't sit like this.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.958
Manspread.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.919
Spread. Manspread…
Spread it out. Air it out.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.046
-Air this out.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.799
-Oh.
-The hell?

24:27.883 --> 24:31.261
If I was just five years older…

24:31.344 --> 24:32.554
What you talkin' about?

24:33.138 --> 24:35.474
That's when
my double social security kick in.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.475
Huh.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.268
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

24:38.351 --> 24:42.022
From when I worked
at the post office, licking stamps.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.148
Oh hell.

24:43.231 --> 24:47.652
Then at Party Central,
I was blowin' balloons.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.029
-Mmm.
-Sure was.

24:49.112 --> 24:52.949
I was just lickin' and blowin'
and blowin' and lickin'

24:53.033 --> 24:54.618
for about ten years.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.329
-And I'm good at it too.
-Okay.

24:57.412 --> 25:01.666
I don't know why I'm getting turned on.
I think I wanna send some mail out.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.668
Okay.

25:04.169 --> 25:07.172
Let me just save you
a whole bunch of time, okay?

25:07.255 --> 25:10.175
They share a apartment.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.968
Oh, you're roommates?

25:12.052 --> 25:13.970
-Yes.
-You're just roommates.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.430
-Bam?
-Huh?

25:15.514 --> 25:20.810
Remember Peaches and Harold
shared an apartment for 40 years?

25:21.394 --> 25:22.521
-Oh.
-Uh-huh.

25:23.021 --> 25:27.359
Remember that time I was telling you,
you wanted to buy that Beetle Bug car?

25:27.442 --> 25:28.318
Oh, yes.

25:28.401 --> 25:32.489
And I said, "Don't get it
'cause the motor is in the back."

25:33.198 --> 25:35.408
That's where all the power come from.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.787
-In the back… side of it.

25:38.870 --> 25:39.704
Right.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.498
-Okay.
-Uh-huh.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.291
-Well…
-Yeah.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.045
-I'mma go on to the "back" yard.
-Yeah.

25:47.128 --> 25:50.090
-Yes. Well, I'mma go on and go.
-Thank you for the card.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.424
-Okay.
-We know.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.093
-Joe?
-Yeah?

25:53.176 --> 25:54.010
Good luck.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.596
I… I ain't got nothing to say to them.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.558
-Hell y'all looking at?
-Uh…

25:59.641 --> 26:01.268
-Just…
-Yeah.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.019
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.856
Great. Uh, I'll give you a lesson in life.

26:06.940 --> 26:10.026
In the morning, the sun will rise,

26:11.027 --> 26:12.070
and if it don't,

26:13.238 --> 26:14.406
you have died.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.785
There you go. All I got. Ah, shit.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.665
And there's my family.

26:23.748 --> 26:24.583
Yeah.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.336
Now, Mummy, don't embarrass us.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.964
-Me?
-I mean it.

26:31.464 --> 26:32.424
I won't.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.010
Just knock at the door.

26:38.054 --> 26:38.888
Sorry, sorry.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.226
Whoo!

26:44.102 --> 26:47.272
Wakanda forever!

26:49.024 --> 26:50.775
-Who she think she is?
-Right.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.114
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.533
I'm Cathy Brown. This is my mother, Agnes.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.078
-Oh. Hello.
-Hello, everybody. Hello.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.831
Whoa. Wait a minute now.
Where you think you're going?

27:04.914 --> 27:07.167
-The hell?
-They just walked in. I don't know.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.418
How do you do?

27:08.501 --> 27:10.462
Cora, who you let in my house?
What the hell?

27:10.545 --> 27:11.379
H… how…

27:11.463 --> 27:12.714
-Mabel…
-Y'all with the census?

27:13.298 --> 27:15.008
-No.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.344
"The census?"

27:17.844 --> 27:18.970
Wow, you're a big woman.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.097
-What?
-Mummy!

27:21.181 --> 27:24.601
I'm just saying. She's a big woman,
and I mean big, like, wow!

27:25.101 --> 27:28.104
Is the air
thin up there?

27:28.688 --> 27:32.525
Oh, ha ha. Hell! Who is this?
Somebody tell me who is this?

27:32.609 --> 27:33.985
How can we help you?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.612
-We're here to surprise--
-Oh.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.322
-Davi!
-Cousin Cathy!

27:38.031 --> 27:39.032
Oh, hi.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.325
Aunt Agnes.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.994
-What are you doing here?

27:43.078 --> 27:45.163
We came for your graduation.

27:45.246 --> 27:48.166
Of course. We had to.
For your grandfather's sake.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.794
Great. What a surprise.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.545
Surprise.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.130
-Great.
-Oh!

27:54.214 --> 27:56.966
Oh hell, I didn't mean
to drop her, break her damn bones.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.551
I'm fine.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.720
-Madea?
-What? She was heavy. Shit.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.555
How did you know I was here?

28:02.639 --> 28:05.475
That's why I was asking so many questions.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.977
Really? You didn't suspect a thing?

28:08.061 --> 28:08.895
Oh!

28:08.978 --> 28:11.022
And we came all the way from Dublin.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.482
-Well, she…

28:12.565 --> 28:13.608
In a hairy plane.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.527
-Yes.
-Hairy plane?

28:15.610 --> 28:17.028
-What's a hairy plane?
-I don't know.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.363
You must be Tim.

28:18.863 --> 28:19.989
-Yes.
-Hello.

28:20.073 --> 28:23.118
-Yeah. Nice to meet you.
-Davi's told us so much about you.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.953
-Likewise.
-Yes, I have.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.372
-And this is his family.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.458
How do you do?

28:37.090 --> 28:39.426
Why do you all look like
you have your knickers in a bunch.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.220
What? I know damn well what she said, Joe.

28:42.303 --> 28:43.972
Joe, I heard her. What'd she say?

28:44.055 --> 28:46.224
-Wait one damn minute.
-What… what… what…

28:46.307 --> 28:48.893
What… what did you just damn say?

28:48.977 --> 28:52.021
-She called us a bunch of niggers.
-Did I say something wrong?

28:52.105 --> 28:54.566
What'd you mean, if you don't know
if you said something wrong?

28:54.649 --> 28:58.027
Yeah, you said something wrong
up in this bitch!

28:58.111 --> 28:59.446
No, she said "knickers."

28:59.529 --> 29:02.157
-I heard her say we're a bunch of n-words.
-Oh no, no, no, no.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.783
That's not what she said.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.286
Don't tell me I didn't hear what I heard.

29:06.369 --> 29:09.247
She said, "Y'all a bunch of niggers."

29:09.330 --> 29:11.958
-No, no, no. "Knickers." "Knickers."
-Yes.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.209
C-K. "Knickers."

29:13.293 --> 29:16.171
Don't be calling us no niggers
up in this nigga.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.715
Hold on, it's "knickers." It's underwear.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.968
Yes, yes. It's "knickers."
These are knickers.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.553
-Ooh!

29:23.636 --> 29:25.513
And she just damn flashed me.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.599
Actually, that almost turned me on
a little bit.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.602
-What'd it look like?
-It looked like a knicker.

29:30.685 --> 29:31.728
She don't shave.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.938
Black is black. Completely black.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.106
Black. Bad cop.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.150
I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance
to tidy myself up.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.736
It does look like a busted mattress.
But I'm sorry.

29:39.819 --> 29:42.238
Well, say that.
Hell, say panties or something.

29:42.322 --> 29:45.366
Baby, them ain't no panties.
Them some big-ass drawers.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.870
It's just… look, it's just a language gap.
That's all.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.873
That language gap almost got you capped.
You better be careful here.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.042
-You better not say that again.
-Well, you know, I--

29:54.125 --> 29:55.084
She won't. Right, Mummy?

29:55.168 --> 29:57.879
She better not, Cathy B…
whatever your name is.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.047
I won't. I'm sorry.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.216
Well, now all that's cleared up. Um--

30:01.299 --> 30:02.675
Is it, Cora? Is it clear?

30:02.759 --> 30:04.385
Is it really cleared up, Cora?

30:04.469 --> 30:08.264
Yes, it's cleared up, Madea.
It's clear, Uncle Joe. It was a mistake.

30:08.348 --> 30:13.978
I'm still offended by being called
a nigger up in my house full of niggas.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.146
It's okay, Uncle Joe.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.691
Well, we were about to take the boys
to dinner down at Red Lobster.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.318
We would love for you to come.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.444
Cora, hold on.

30:21.528 --> 30:25.532
Now you want me to sit
at a table with white folk from Europeo?

30:25.615 --> 30:28.910
And I gotta sit there
with a police officer from the popo?

30:28.993 --> 30:31.079
You just hold on
one cotton-pickin' minute.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.372
No, no!

30:32.455 --> 30:34.624
-She said "cotton-pickin'."
-Excuse me.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.334
Now she say "cotton-pickin'"?

30:36.417 --> 30:40.755
We came here to celebrate
our nephew's graduation.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.050
Tomorrow
he's going to be a proud boy.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.760
Now she called him a proud boy.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.637
Now she called him a damn proud boy.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.389
Oh, hell no!

30:49.472 --> 30:51.850
-Calm down. Your pressure!
-I gotta get out of here.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.686
I'm gonna represent.
I'm gonna put on all my Black shit.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.188
Every Black shit I've got, I'm puttin' on.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.148
If it's more convenient,
we can stay at a hotel.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.692
-No. Madea?
-What?

31:00.775 --> 31:03.611
-They talking about--
-All right, all right. That's fine.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.615
Y'all came all the way from, uh, Iran.
You may as well come down to Red Lobster.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.950
Ireland.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.994
She gon' be correcting me too
after what I said?

31:11.077 --> 31:13.371
I know what I said. I said Iran.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.833
I said the same damn thing you said.
You don't know where you're from?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.418
-Okay, do you wanna ride with us?
-Sure.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.878
Great. Okay. Leaving.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.463
Try to correct me
when I know I'm saying Iran right.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.173
-We'll meet you there.
-Okay.

31:24.257 --> 31:27.176
-All right. I got shotgun.
-You can ride with me, Aunt Bam.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.096
Why do I feel like I've just been invited
to the Last Supper?

31:30.179 --> 31:31.014
I'm coming.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.355
-Oh my God.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.107
What, uh, Agnes? Agnes?

31:41.190 --> 31:42.400
Yes. Agnes Brown.

31:42.483 --> 31:45.945
Oh! Shut up! I'm a Brown too.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.405
-Really?
-Yes.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.115
No, you're more Black.

31:49.198 --> 31:52.076
Mummy, he is Mr. Brown.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.371
Oh, yes.
Of course. Maybe we're related.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.004
Shut up! Look at you,
looking like you looking.

32:03.087 --> 32:06.925
Well, it looks like your great-aunt Agnes
and Mr. Brown are hitting it off.

32:07.008 --> 32:07.967
Looks that way.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.219
Mr. Brown, it's good
to see you gettin' along.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.889
Well, yeah, Cora,
I speak all kinds of languages.

32:12.972 --> 32:17.185
I speak, uh, high brew,
low brew, Hebrew, cold brew.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.978
I speak 'em all, Cora.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.356
She's speaking English, Mr. Brown.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.566
Half the time
I don't know what she saying.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.235
I just look at her and laugh.
She be saying stuff I don't even know.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.236
Watch this, Cora.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.077
-I don't understand a word he's saying.
-I know.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.037
Is… is he speaking English?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.539
Yes, but you have to listen very closely.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.167
I am, Cathy. My ears can't hear that fast.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.670
-Cora, my sugar level is low.
-Let me check my--

32:43.753 --> 32:45.004
My sugar gets low sometimes

32:45.088 --> 32:47.298
when I get excited
or get anxious about something.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.385
Hand me Madea's purse.
I'mma check to see if she got some sugar.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.470
-She usually--
-I did not pass you that purse.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.430
You did. I'mma see if she got some candy.

32:54.514 --> 32:58.226
Give me something, Cora. Hurry,
I'm fading down. I'm going low-low.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.561
-Here, get a few. Hurry up.
-Okay. Give me some.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.064
-Before she come back from the restroom.
-Hurry up.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.525
Okay, all right. Mmm. Oh yeah.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.777
-Get you a chocolate.
-Right before dinner?

33:07.860 --> 33:11.406
Yeah, yeah. It'll… it'll help cleanse
your Pil… your Pilates.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.907
No, I don't do yoga.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.659
He means cleanse your palate.

33:14.742 --> 33:15.576
-Oh.
-Yeah.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.414
-I need a feckin' dictionary.
-No, no, your diction is just fine.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.375
Just go on and take it.
Take it, right. Just eat it. Mmm.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.710
-Hurry up.
-Thank you.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.129
Yeah. Ooh, Cora, this is crunchy.

33:26.629 --> 33:30.091
-Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
-You like that?

33:30.174 --> 33:31.843
-What's that in the middle?
-Huh?

33:31.926 --> 33:34.679
-In the middle. What's that?
-Deez nuts.

33:34.762 --> 33:37.015
-Did you get a nut?
-Not yet.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.727
-That's enough.
-What did he say?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.854
I don't know. Something about his nuts.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.939
Apparently, they eat
chocolate before dinner.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.567
-Do you want some?
-No, that'll ruin my figure.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.154
Seriously, Cathy.
It's a bit late for that now.

33:53.281 --> 33:57.035
Oh Lord.
The line to the bathroom so long.

33:57.785 --> 34:01.289
Hey, there. Look at Agnes over there.
How y'all doing, babe?

34:01.372 --> 34:04.876
Ooh, Lord. Long lines at bathroom.

34:04.959 --> 34:08.421
-Everything come out all right?
-Always do, Cora. Hell.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.841
Me, I've been eating here a long time.
You remember I was working at The Field.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.760
I was on The Field,
all the time, I'd come here.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.429
Oh, I used to play rugby. Did you play?

34:16.512 --> 34:19.682
No, baby, I didn't rug nobody.
No, I was a--

34:19.766 --> 34:21.517
A big Black linebacker for the Bears.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.604
I'm about to play
stab a Black bastard for the Saints.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.105
Say one more damn thing.

34:26.189 --> 34:29.108
No, baby. I worked at a club
called The Field. It was for strippers.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.027
Right. Sure was.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.695
Back in the day. I didn't make it rain,

34:32.779 --> 34:34.864
but I sure made it drizzle.
I could get that change.

34:34.947 --> 34:37.450
They didn't throw no dollars.
They'd throw the rolled-up nickels

34:37.533 --> 34:41.037
and hit me with them quarters and stuff.
It hurt, but I got that money.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.455
-I paid my bills.
-Yes.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.291
Madea, now you want to come
to this place and have a nice dinner,

34:45.374 --> 34:47.668
and you gonna sit at the table
and talk about strippin'.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.796
-Hos got to eat too.
-What?

34:49.879 --> 34:53.549
This Red Lobster full of hos.
You don't believe me? I'mma tell you.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.346
I know that's right!

34:58.429 --> 35:01.349
Full of hos. Full of hos.
Whole damn place.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.393
Did you hear all them hos?
That's a hollaback. Cardi B, baby.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.438
We're at this nice restaurant now.
Don't do that, Madea.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.273
It's okay. Mummy's no spring chicken.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.484
Oh no. I've been around the block before.

35:11.567 --> 35:12.652
You was a doorknob?

35:12.735 --> 35:14.070
On a bike with no saddle.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.029
Get out!

35:15.113 --> 35:17.365
Hoo! That ain't a spring chicken.
That's an old crow.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.831
Yes, Joe.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.586
I don't know what all y'all lookin' at.
I'mma represent.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.506
If I gotta come up here
and sit down here at this table

35:33.589 --> 35:37.426
with a copper and with somebody
using the n-word, nigga,

35:37.510 --> 35:41.472
then I'mma come up here
and represent all the Black Lives Matter.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.851
We all gonna protest.
We all gonna burn our shit down.

35:44.934 --> 35:45.768
Really?

35:45.852 --> 35:48.646
Well, you might wanna get real full.
You know what's about to happen?

35:49.230 --> 35:52.984
You about to lose your job.

35:53.067 --> 35:56.445
You about to lose your job.

35:58.948 --> 36:02.243
Here we go, Uncle Joe.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.995
-You with him too?
-I like that, Joe.

36:04.078 --> 36:07.206
Defund this shit. Get rid of the police.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.750
The same way that we're
saying "defund the police,"

36:09.834 --> 36:11.794
there are criminals saying the same thing.

36:11.878 --> 36:15.339
That's why crime has gotten
so much worse. Think about it.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.092
I don't know the answers, but somebody
needs to have some conversation

36:18.176 --> 36:19.677
'cause you'll never figure nothing out

36:19.760 --> 36:22.180
as long as everybody
screamin' and yellin' at each other.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.390
My tax dollar, my tax dollar--

36:24.473 --> 36:28.102
Joe, let me ask you something, babe.
When's the last time you paid a tax?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.562
You don't pay no damn tax.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.063
Can we just let this go, please?

36:31.147 --> 36:33.649
Well, uh, do you want
there to be lawlessness then?

36:33.733 --> 36:35.776
Hey, babe, you think that scare me?

36:35.860 --> 36:39.697
Bring it. Look, I know lawlessness.
I spent my whole life in lawlessness.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.908
-Look who I live with. That's my sister.
-Yes.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.869
-Braless and lawless. Yep.
-Lawless and braless.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.163
Them titties ain't never been captivated.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.624
They been running free all the time.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.919
You want me to feel sorry for y'all?
No, I ain't finna feel sorry for y'all.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.423
Well, now you're doing the very thing
that you don't want us to do.

36:57.506 --> 37:00.301
You don't want them to judge
all Black people as criminals,

37:00.384 --> 37:02.845
but you wanna judge all police as killers?

37:02.929 --> 37:05.431
-Madea, say something to stop this.
-I got it. I got it.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.391
Set of his keys are in here. Look.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.687
Oh, call the police.
That my car alarm. That my car alarm.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.482
-See? See? See?
-You want the police now?

37:15.107 --> 37:17.818
Oh, never mind. It went off.
Okay, what was I saying?

37:17.902 --> 37:20.238
Not a damn thing.
You see? You see? You see?

37:20.321 --> 37:22.740
-You mad at the police till you need 'em.
-That's true.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.451
You say, "I don't take a stand,"
till somebody break your damn house,

37:25.534 --> 37:27.495
steal your shit,
they're the first thing you call.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.830
-Ooh, here come the food.
-There the food, baby.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.750
-Ooh, that look good.
-Lay it on me.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.127
-That look good.
-Look at her.

37:35.211 --> 37:38.339
-This is hot.
-Oh, we got that surf and turf.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.596
Hey. Hey, don't you tell her
I opened the door and let you in.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.806
That was a good meal.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.100
-Yeah, that was good.
-Sorry I'm late.

37:49.183 --> 37:51.310
-Good to see you.
-Nice to see you.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.770
-You too.
-What's up, son?

37:52.853 --> 37:55.231
-I am full.
-I mean it.

37:55.314 --> 37:56.524
My graduation boy.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.695
Yo, I'm sorry I'm late. All right?
I had to miss dinner. I got caught up.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.488
-It's all good.
-I thought I would come here.

38:02.571 --> 38:04.115
Hey, Dad, you remember my friend Davi?

38:05.074 --> 38:06.409
What's up, Davi? Huh?

38:07.451 --> 38:09.745
You ain't gonna even shake his hand?

38:09.829 --> 38:12.123
-Hi, Richard.
-What's up, Laura?

38:12.206 --> 38:16.752

Davi's family from Ireland.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.629
-They came for the graduation.
-How do you do?

38:18.713 --> 38:20.589
Okay, okay.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.052
-It's okay. Mabel, just calm down.
-No, I know Joe did it.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.055
He ain't stealin' nothin'.
You ain't got nothin' to steal.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.850
What the hell do you mean?
All the collector's items I have in here.

38:30.933 --> 38:34.020
I done collected this stuff
from all over the world of Georgia.

38:34.103 --> 38:38.607
-Right. At the flea market.
-He better not say nothing to me.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.234
Is that Madea over there?

38:40.318 --> 38:42.111
-Yeah, it is.
-Oh, don't go…

38:42.194 --> 38:43.529
Don't go over there, baby.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.656
-Gonna say hey to her.
-Oh, you don't listen, do you?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.450
-Oh, here he come.
-He don't listen.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.701
Hey, Bam, how you doin'?

38:48.784 --> 38:51.287
-Talk to somebody else. Go on.
-Hey, Madea.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.207
-Bam, I'mma tell you one time.
-What?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.375
-Duck.
-Oh!

38:57.251 --> 39:00.171
-Come on, Madea. I said hey.
-Bam, that ain't no damn duck.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.007
Hey, Madea?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.344
Madea, I know you hear me.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.013
-M… Madea--

39:09.096 --> 39:09.972

39:13.851 --> 39:14.935

39:15.019 --> 39:17.480

Oh, Kamala, I did it.
Oh, Kamala, I did it.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.735
You did it, Joe.

39:22.818 --> 39:26.072
Down my leather pants.
All down my leather pants.

39:26.155 --> 39:31.827
Well, Joe, it's a good thing
you got on them boots.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.705
Baby, you almost scared
the sugar out of me.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.416
Y'all act like that boy
did not just walk in here and assault me.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.751
He assaulted me.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.378
We better get the feck out of here.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.587
I think you're right.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.715
He just assaulted me.
He just put his hand, it just swole up.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.802
No, I was not tryin' to assault you,
Madea. I was just sayin' hi.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.637
"Hi" is two letters, an H and I.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.808
No, Mabel, high is
what I was when I got here,

39:53.891 --> 39:55.434
but I ain't high now.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.603
Madea, I'm sorry, okay? I'm…

39:58.854 --> 39:59.814
My bad.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.691
It was lovely meeting you.
We have to go back to the hotel.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.945
And, Davi, if you want to live,
get your arse into that car now.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.072
We'll see you at the graduation.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.824
Please, please stay.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.950

40:11.033 --> 40:12.535
Aunt Agnes, I'm going to stay here.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.162
Well, I'm telling you now.
If you don't turn up to that graduation,

40:15.246 --> 40:16.622
I'll fecking kill you meself.

40:16.705 --> 40:19.834
-No, no, no. Please. Uh, she's sorry.
-Yeah.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.085
It won't happen again.

40:21.168 --> 40:22.336
Well, I…

40:22.420 --> 40:24.630
It's okay, Aunt Agnes. It's okay.

40:24.713 --> 40:27.466
-Yeah. Come on. Relax. Have a seat.
-Yeah. Have a seat.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.176
-Okay.
-Don't slide off the plastic.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.179
Get comfortable.
Look at these smiling faces.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.433
Cora, you better come get
this bastard before I gut him like a fish.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.435
Hell, I don't want him here,
and he's still here.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.477
Get his ass outta here.

40:38.561 --> 40:41.564
-You 'bout to scare our guests again.
-I don't give a… if I scare 'em.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.482
Get him outta here. He shouldn't be here.

40:43.566 --> 40:44.817
We got guests in the house.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.777
Richard, I told you
not to come. Get on out.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.655
You just spoke to him earlier
like he's supposed to be here.

40:49.738 --> 40:52.992
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean
to scare you, but I don't give a damn.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.743
-Mabel.
-What?

40:55.369 --> 40:56.662
That's a shame.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.622
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.086
Laura, I want to thank you and your family

41:04.628 --> 41:06.255
for the care you took with Davi.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.340
Ah, he's very special.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.386
Yes. You know I worried about him
coming over to America on his own.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.930
-I didn't know what to expect.
-Well, he is doin' great.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.517
Yes. You'll have to come
and visit in Ireland.

41:18.601 --> 41:22.396
What? Oh, I like that.
Yeah, I heard it's beautiful there.

41:22.480 --> 41:27.985
It is. So, you, Tim, and all the family
come and visit Davi on the farm.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.070
The farm?

41:30.154 --> 41:32.781
Yes, he's goin' home
to take over the family farm.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.784
Oh, I didn't… I didn't know that.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.621
Yes, that was the deal.
He went to school here,

41:38.704 --> 41:41.040
and then he comes home
and takes over the family farm.

41:41.123 --> 41:42.416
He's a good boy.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.626
Uh, yeah, he is.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.378
Um… So, does he know this?

41:46.462 --> 41:47.630
That he's a good boy?

41:47.713 --> 41:52.009
Uh, no,
I mean about the family farm.

41:52.092 --> 41:54.553
Oh, yes.
We talk about it every day.

41:55.971 --> 41:56.847
Cool, I see.

41:58.140 --> 42:02.561
-Oh, lookit, that is one big cock.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.481
You know, they've said that
a few times about me.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.108
I'm glad you notice a king
when you see one.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.403
Yeah.

42:11.487 --> 42:14.907
It's hot.
Is it hot in here, or is it me?

42:14.990 --> 42:16.784
I feel… I'm sweating bullets.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.955
Maybe I'm going through the change again.
This'll be the third time.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.332
-Oh.
-Could be the long flight.

42:23.415 --> 42:24.959
-Yeah.
-Maybe I need fresh air.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.293
Yes. Yes, then let's…

42:26.377 --> 42:27.836
-We'll go to the yard.
-Yes.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.088
Why we sittin' here like this?

42:29.171 --> 42:30.965
-Madea.
-They finna run an intervention?

42:31.048 --> 42:33.342
-Tim want to talk to us.
-That's why the chairs like this?

42:33.425 --> 42:35.511
-Yes.
-I guess he gotta tell us something.

42:35.594 --> 42:37.596
Ooh, all right, uh…

42:37.680 --> 42:40.599
I don't think
your Aunt Agnes is feeling too well.

42:40.683 --> 42:43.561
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just… I just need some fresh air.

42:43.644 --> 42:46.939
-Come on, sit down.
-Come on over here, fresh. Sit by me.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.441
Oh, uh, thank you very much, sir.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.697
-Fresh air. Maybe I get you sunglasses.
-Sit by me, girl.

42:54.780 --> 42:57.366
Tim, remember
when your great-grandmother shot that gun,

42:57.449 --> 42:59.451
and your father jumped
out of the way like a coward?

42:59.535 --> 43:02.705
-Now that was funny.
-There weren't nothin' funny about that.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.791
-Yes, it was, and I'm not your son.
-Hey, what are you doin'?

43:05.874 --> 43:07.293
-Stop it.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.670
Look at him, he's a coward. He's a loser.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.630
-Watch your mouth.
-Richard, what are you doing?

43:11.714 --> 43:12.881
Stop this, okay?

43:12.965 --> 43:15.676
-Who do you think you're talking to?
-I'm talking to you, little boy.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.095
-I'm old enough to be your father.
-What the hell goin' on?

43:18.178 --> 43:19.972
Davi, Davi, stop.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.765
-You act like you--
-This is about your son.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.393
I told you not come in here
with that mess. Now just stop.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.645
You act like you don't hear this boy
talking like that.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.398
-What are they arguing about?
-I don't know.

43:29.481 --> 43:33.360
He's sorry, okay?
Can we all just sit down and… and talk?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.195
I just… I need to tell you guys something.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.947
-I think that's a good idea.
-Okay.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.617
Yeah, we better do that
because y'all gotta get him outta here.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.578
Whatever you wanna tell us, you better
tell us quick to get him outta here.

43:42.661 --> 43:45.331
So whatever you have to say,
baby, say it, 'cause he got to go.

43:45.414 --> 43:48.626
-I'm runnin' out of patience.
-I came… I came here for my son.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.586
-I ain't come here for all this.
-Hey, Tim.

43:50.669 --> 43:53.422
There's a lot of us
that don't want your Black ass here.

43:53.505 --> 43:54.923
-You understand?
-Madea!

43:55.007 --> 43:57.593
He comin' up in here
with all that damn attitude.

43:57.676 --> 44:01.055
Baby, say what you gotta say
before I have to hurt your daddy.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.098
I'm not like your mama,
who gonna be all kind.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.809
-Shut up. Say what you gotta say, son.
-Okay.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.604
Are there gonna be guns again?
Because Mummy can't take anymore.

44:08.687 --> 44:11.273
-I would love to say no, but--
-I can't make no promises.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.734
-I stay locks and loaded.
-Probably.

44:13.817 --> 44:14.985
He's sorry.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.528
You ain't gotta apologize for me.

44:16.612 --> 44:20.324
You mad at her too 'cause of how she got
you in the divorce helpin' my sister?

44:20.407 --> 44:21.825
-She didn't get me.
-Please.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.661
-You better tell 'em.
-Can you stop?

44:23.744 --> 44:25.120
-Can you?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.998
You right. We talked about this.
I will try. I will try.

44:28.082 --> 44:28.957
What the hell?

44:29.041 --> 44:31.210
-Wait, Mabel.
-I'm trackin' with you, Bam.

44:31.293 --> 44:34.213
-Right, right.
-We talked about this. What's goin' on?

44:34.296 --> 44:35.923
Are they not divorced?

44:36.006 --> 44:39.301
-Wait, now Irish is catchin' up with us.
-I need subscripts.

44:39.385 --> 44:43.639
I… I'm not fully caught up
'cause I don't know what, mm, is goin' on.

44:43.722 --> 44:46.350
Okay, look,
can we all just please listen to Tim?

44:46.433 --> 44:49.978
Please, this is about Tim, okay?

44:50.062 --> 44:51.647
Can you all just chill?

44:51.730 --> 44:52.731
All right, great.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.650
Tim, baby, you got the floor, okay?

44:54.733 --> 44:56.985
Maybe only ten seconds, but please go.

44:58.070 --> 45:02.783
I've done this before.
My name is Agnes, and I am an alcoholic.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.785
-That ain't what this is.
-Okay, sorry.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.620
I'm sorry.
Whatever you got to say, say it.

45:08.330 --> 45:09.915
Okay, um…

45:10.499 --> 45:11.375
Uh…

45:14.002 --> 45:14.920
Okay, uh…

45:16.380 --> 45:17.381
You got this.

45:18.424 --> 45:23.846
Uh, family, um, this is
really hard for me to say,

45:23.929 --> 45:27.307
and I've been struggling
with how to tell you this.

45:28.517 --> 45:29.476
So, uh…

45:31.270 --> 45:32.271
I'm…

45:33.230 --> 45:34.606
I'm just gonna say it.

45:35.607 --> 45:37.276
Uh, I'm…

45:39.987 --> 45:41.238
I'm… I'm gay.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.366
So…

45:56.003 --> 45:58.589
That's it? That's all you wanna say?
Well, baby, we knew that.

45:58.672 --> 46:00.549
-Right.
-We already knew that.

46:00.632 --> 46:03.010
Wait. You guys don't wanna talk
about me being gay?

46:03.093 --> 46:05.262
We been talking about that for years.
We all knew that.

46:05.345 --> 46:08.515
We all talked about it.
We were waitin' on you to say somethin'.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.560
We don't rush nobody. You come out
when you want to. That's fine.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.896
-You all right. We know that.
-Mom, really?

46:13.979 --> 46:15.773
We knew when you was a little boy.

46:15.856 --> 46:16.857
We knew.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.777
Yeah, baby, when somebody love you,
it don't matter if you gay or not.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.653
They gonna love you anyway.
And we love you.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.947
-Your family loves you, okay?
-I'm so proud of you.

46:24.031 --> 46:25.783
You ain't good at being down low.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.785
-Oh man.

46:27.868 --> 46:31.079
-That's embarrassing.
-No, don't be embarrassed. Proud of you.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.791
-I love you, guys.
-I love you too.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.125
But back to my question.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.544
Why the hell was y'all two talking?
What y'all talking about?

46:37.628 --> 46:39.880
-Tim.
-Richard, don't.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.132
Told you I didn't wanna come here.
But for you, I came.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.343
-Richard.
-I came for you. No, I came for you.

46:44.426 --> 46:45.385
Damn this family.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.054
-Damn the family?

46:47.137 --> 46:49.097
I… I… I told you this wouldn't work.

46:49.181 --> 46:52.893
We're supposed to be celebrating
Tim tonight, okay? Can we focus on him?

46:52.976 --> 46:55.354
Now Sylvia, she wants
to beat around the bush.

46:55.437 --> 46:58.315
-I'm gonna be straight up and tell y'all.
-What are you doing?

46:58.398 --> 47:00.025
-We gettin' married.
-What?

47:00.108 --> 47:01.485
Shut up!

47:01.568 --> 47:03.153
He getting married to your best friend?

47:04.488 --> 47:08.617
I am so glad that you are not refunded.

47:08.700 --> 47:09.618
Refunded?

47:09.701 --> 47:10.786
Yes.

47:10.869 --> 47:14.540
'Cause it's so good
to have a policeman right in your family

47:14.623 --> 47:17.042
for such a time as this.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.710
-It sure is. Thank you.
-True.

47:18.794 --> 47:20.963
Just… just take a second.

47:21.046 --> 47:22.798
Laura, you gonna say something?

47:23.382 --> 47:25.884
Hell, no! You… Are you kidding me?

47:27.261 --> 47:29.137
Look, you need to get out now.

47:29.638 --> 47:30.514
Now.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.474
Ellie, sweetie…

47:32.558 --> 47:33.934
-Yeah--
-Sweet baby sis.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.854
It's all right. It's fine.
I'm happy for you two.

47:36.937 --> 47:37.938
Stop that lyin'.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.983
Walk over there, punch that girl
in her throat and knock them teeth out.

47:41.066 --> 47:43.569
Then I'mma go and grab her
and knock her ass down.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.404
I got him.
You just do what you need to do.

47:45.487 --> 47:47.072
-Madea!
-We all got your back.

47:47.155 --> 47:48.907
Put them stilettos
down her throat.

47:48.991 --> 47:51.785
Madea, please. All right?
Everybody just chill out.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.121
Nobody's thinkin' and carin' about this.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.832
-This weekend is about my baby.
-That's right.

47:56.915 --> 47:59.209
-I have waited for this a long time.
-Yeah.

47:59.293 --> 48:02.462
Graduating valedictorian.
This is Black boy joy at its finest.

48:02.546 --> 48:06.800
If we could please
act like family for two seconds.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.303
-Fake it till we make it?
-That's right.

48:09.386 --> 48:11.430
That's fine, but they're not our family.

48:11.513 --> 48:13.432
That's right,
not our family. Got to go.

48:13.515 --> 48:14.349
Got to.

48:14.433 --> 48:16.476
My son want me here.
I ain't goin' nowhere.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.817
-Madea! What are you doin'?
-What you say about stayin'?

48:23.901 --> 48:24.943
I guess we be goin'.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.987
I'll see you at graduation, son.
I'm proud of you.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.822
All right. Let's go. Babe, let's go.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.700
She's so pretty.

48:31.783 --> 48:33.660
Cora, I got to pee.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.662
-Don't do that.
-Don't want me to say it out loud?

48:35.746 --> 48:37.122
-No.
-Cora, I gotta pee.

48:37.205 --> 48:38.790
-What you--
-Cora, I got to pee.

48:38.874 --> 48:40.584
-Would you go on?
-I'mma go pee.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.169
-What the hell?
-Don't be long.

48:42.252 --> 48:46.590
And if you are long,
bring it back.

48:46.673 --> 48:49.343
What a wonderful family.
I really like them.

48:49.426 --> 48:50.719
They're so funny.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.598
-Aunt Bam.
-You seem a bit off.

48:54.681 --> 48:56.224
I just like dark humor.

48:56.308 --> 48:57.517
Oh, what…

48:58.143 --> 49:00.979
Wait a minute. I…
Somethin' is wrong with Mr. Brown.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.398
I think it's sugar.
I need to check his sugar.

49:03.482 --> 49:06.485
You have candy. I need to give him
some more candy. Where's your purse?

49:06.568 --> 49:08.862
-Cora, you been in my purse?
-Yes.

49:08.946 --> 49:11.531
-You gave them candy out of my purse?
-Yes.

49:11.615 --> 49:14.242
-How many you give 'em?
-They had four or five of 'em.

49:14.326 --> 49:16.536
Oh, hell, no.
Cora, that's weed you gave 'em.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.789
-What? Weed!
-Yes, they high as hell.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.248
My great-aunt is high?

49:20.332 --> 49:22.542
Eh, I love you. I love you.

49:22.626 --> 49:23.794
Davi, I love you.

49:23.877 --> 49:25.712
I love him. I love him.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.715
I love you too.
I feel like I'm 16. I love you.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.717
Let me go check on Mr. Brown.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.636
Cora!

49:32.719 --> 49:34.262
Oh, hell, Brown.

49:34.346 --> 49:35.639
Oh, hell, no. Hold on.

49:35.722 --> 49:37.808
-They call me the Brown Panther!
-Jump!

49:37.891 --> 49:39.226
-Watch me fly!
-Mr. Brown!

49:39.309 --> 49:41.019
Agnes, catch me, baby.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.730
I'mma fly. Can I fly? I can fly, Cora!

49:43.814 --> 49:46.274
Watch me fly!

49:46.358 --> 49:48.777
-Cora, I'mma fly.
-Burn yourself up.

49:48.860 --> 49:51.738
-Now you jump off a roof.

49:51.822 --> 49:55.701
Hey, I need to get some of what
you've been out there gettin', Brown.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.703
-Somebody, help him down.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.917
-Now that looked like it feckin' hurt.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.502
-I missed.

50:05.585 --> 50:08.005
-Sorry, Brown.
-Should've got a video.

50:08.547 --> 50:10.382
Can you believe they got high?

50:11.508 --> 50:15.220
I mean, come on. You never know
what you're gonna find in a Madea purse.

50:15.303 --> 50:17.681
Mm-hmm. Ain't that the truth?

50:18.890 --> 50:19.850
You okay, though?

50:20.851 --> 50:22.978
Yeah, um, I'm fine. I'm fine.

50:24.312 --> 50:25.188
No.

50:25.272 --> 50:26.106
What?

50:26.189 --> 50:27.024
You…

50:27.107 --> 50:29.651
You were so happy,
but after dinner you got sad.

50:29.735 --> 50:31.695
No, it's okay.

50:31.778 --> 50:34.406
I mean, it… it's been a day, you know?

50:34.489 --> 50:36.283
There's a lot going on and…

50:36.366 --> 50:40.537
Now Davi's family is talking about
he needs to go back to Europe and…

50:40.620 --> 50:42.205
And that makes you sad?

50:43.123 --> 50:44.291
Well, I mean…

50:45.792 --> 50:49.546
I know how much Davi loves Tim.

50:49.629 --> 50:50.964
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

50:52.215 --> 50:53.133
Yeah.

50:53.216 --> 50:54.801
I'm glad they came out.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.970
Did they, though?

50:57.679 --> 50:59.139
Well, where were you?

50:59.222 --> 51:00.766
Oh, I was there.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.476
-I was there.
-Uh-huh.

51:02.976 --> 51:04.311
But did Davi come out?

51:04.394 --> 51:07.022
-Or just my baby. I'm just saying.

51:07.105 --> 51:09.608
-Yes, you… Actually, you are right.
-Mm-hmm.

51:10.108 --> 51:13.528
Maybe he didn't want his family to know

51:13.612 --> 51:16.364
that he was…
You know, he wasn't expecting them.

51:17.282 --> 51:18.116
Maybe.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.951
I just want them to be happy.

51:20.035 --> 51:22.954
So, how about, uh, Sylvia and Richard?

51:23.455 --> 51:27.793
Mm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
I don't wanna think about him or her.

51:27.876 --> 51:32.589
I just want to focus
on my baby's graduation.

51:33.715 --> 51:35.008
-That's it.

51:35.801 --> 51:36.718
Come in.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.428
-Hey there.
-Hey.

51:38.512 --> 51:41.515
I was getting ready to go to bed,
but I wanted to come check on you.

51:41.598 --> 51:43.308
I know this been a rough day.

51:43.391 --> 51:45.477
-Yeah. I'm good.
-You good?

51:45.560 --> 51:47.354
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yeah.

51:47.437 --> 51:49.564
I don't wanna talk about it. I'm good.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.650
-You don't wanna talk about it?
-Mm-mmm.

51:51.733 --> 51:54.736
Okay, well, my house, my rules,
so we're gonna talk about it.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.196
Oh, okay.

51:56.279 --> 52:00.075
That man ran off with your best friend.
I don't understand. That's horrible.

52:00.158 --> 52:02.244
Just terrible
that they would just leave you like that.

52:02.327 --> 52:06.498
Well, they didn't steal
or run off or any of that.

52:06.581 --> 52:10.335
I just… I mean… I just wish
they'd told me about it. That's it.

52:10.418 --> 52:13.922
Let me tell you two things.
I want you to remember this here.

52:14.005 --> 52:16.258
You always know.
God always send you a sign.

52:16.341 --> 52:19.469
People look for a oak tree,
and God dropped a little acorn.

52:19.553 --> 52:22.139
You got to pay attention to the acorn.
That's number one, okay?

52:22.222 --> 52:25.225
And number two, if you don't remember
nothing else I tell you, remember this.

52:25.308 --> 52:26.768
I learned this a long time ago.

52:26.852 --> 52:30.605
Never let your girlfriend
and your man hang out too often.

52:31.231 --> 52:35.110
So you think
this all happened before my divorce?

52:35.819 --> 52:39.781
Sometimes I think that the mall is open,
but ain't nobody shoppin'.

52:39.865 --> 52:41.783
I sti… I don't…

52:41.867 --> 52:44.119
-O… o… okay.
-What?

52:44.202 --> 52:46.580
Okay. Nothing.
You like your mama.

52:47.080 --> 52:47.956
Think about it, baby.

52:48.039 --> 52:50.750
You and this girl talk every day
while she helping with your divorce.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.961
When did they find time
to start dating, fall in love,

52:53.044 --> 52:55.297
and do all this if it wasn't before then?

52:55.380 --> 52:56.715
That's what I'm saying.

52:56.798 --> 52:59.050
-See, I knew it.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.469
And baby, it hurts.
My girlfriend stole my man.

53:01.553 --> 53:03.221
I mean, we were so close.

53:03.305 --> 53:06.183
I mean, she just…
Ooh, she walked out with him.

53:06.266 --> 53:09.477
It was bad. Real bad.
I don't wanna talk about it.

53:10.770 --> 53:13.523
-I think she wants to talk about it.
-Uh, Madea?

53:13.607 --> 53:14.524
Hmm?

53:14.608 --> 53:16.318
Would you like to talk about--

53:16.401 --> 53:18.987
-I said I don't want to talk about it.
-Okay.

53:19.487 --> 53:22.324
It was December 1st, 1955.

53:23.825 --> 53:25.410
Bye, Laverne and Shirley.

53:28.413 --> 53:29.456
Archie?

53:29.539 --> 53:32.834
<i>I'll never forget it.</i>
<i>There I was in Montgomery, Alabama.</i>

53:32.918 --> 53:33.960
Archie, where are you?

53:34.044 --> 53:35.879
<i>And my girlfriend Rose, we was roommates.</i>

53:35.962 --> 53:36.796
Archie?

53:36.880 --> 53:38.048
<i>And she left me.</i>

53:38.131 --> 53:39.466
Archie, where are you?

53:40.050 --> 53:40.967
Archie?

53:41.468 --> 53:44.221
<i>He had moved out.</i>
<i>Took everything out of the damn house.</i>

53:44.304 --> 53:47.641
Why are all your clothes gone
from the dresser? Oh no.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.976
Whatever am I going to do? Archie?

53:50.060 --> 53:51.561
<i>I was like, what is going on?</i>

53:51.645 --> 53:54.648
Archie? Are you in the kitchen?

53:56.524 --> 53:57.651
Archie, where are you?

53:57.734 --> 53:59.736
<i>I started looking all around.</i>
<i>I can't find nothing.</i>

53:59.819 --> 54:01.321
<i>I'm looking for my man. He was gone.</i>

54:01.404 --> 54:03.698
Oh no. Oh God.

54:03.782 --> 54:06.493
<i>I knew he was messing around</i>
<i>with somebody. I didn't know who it was.</i>

54:06.576 --> 54:07.535
So terribly sad.

54:07.619 --> 54:09.037
<i>He wasn't gonna just walk out on me.</i>

54:09.120 --> 54:11.831
<i>He did it. Then Bill Clinton did it</i>
<i>later on. I wasn't finna have that.</i>

54:11.915 --> 54:15.752
Operator, give me 1-2 Montgomery 0-6.

54:17.295 --> 54:20.298
Hi, is this the NAACP office?

54:21.174 --> 54:24.511
Is my girlfriend Rose there?
I'm so terribly upset.

54:24.594 --> 54:27.806
I can't find Archie anywhere,
and I'm in this terrible dilemma.

54:28.348 --> 54:29.266
Wait.

54:29.975 --> 54:30.976
Oh no.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.895
I think her things are gone too.

54:34.562 --> 54:36.648
Do you think they left together?

54:40.277 --> 54:43.446
<i>So then I went to her job. She work</i>
<i>over there at the N… </i><i> …CP.</i>

54:43.530 --> 54:44.364
Rose?

54:45.365 --> 54:46.241
Where's Rose?

54:47.534 --> 54:49.369
Excuse me. I'm looking for Rose.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.204
Everybody gonna act like they don't know?

54:51.288 --> 54:55.542
Somebody better tell me
where the hell Rose is at up in here.

54:55.625 --> 54:57.877
Where's Rose? Where is Rose?

55:01.548 --> 55:04.259
Where she at?
Don't nobody know where Rose at?

55:04.342 --> 55:07.762
Y'all don't know where Rose at?
Don't nobody know where Rose at?

55:07.846 --> 55:10.181
Where's Rose at? Where's Rose at?

55:10.724 --> 55:12.434
Where's she at up in this…

55:12.517 --> 55:16.980
Where Rose? Where Rose?
Where Rose? Where Rose? Where Rose?

55:17.063 --> 55:20.483
Is Rose in here?
I don't see Rose. Where's Rose?

55:20.567 --> 55:24.029
Somebody gon' tell me where Rose is at?
Where is Rose at?

55:26.281 --> 55:29.576
<i>I'd been driving all around</i>
<i>looking for her everywhere.</i>

55:30.410 --> 55:32.162
<i>Then I look up on the bus,</i>
<i>and there she is.</i>

55:32.245 --> 55:34.289
What the hell?
I know she ain't on this bus.

55:34.372 --> 55:39.252
<i>I saw her on the bus, and I pulled</i>
<i>in front of that bus in my car.</i>

55:39.336 --> 55:40.503
<i>And the bus driver say…</i>

55:40.587 --> 55:43.340
<i>"Ma'am, you can't</i>
<i>do that. This Montgomery, Alabama."</i>

55:43.423 --> 55:44.924
<i>And I was like, "I don't care."</i>

55:45.008 --> 55:47.010
I know damn well
you hear me on this bus, Rosa.

55:47.093 --> 55:50.597
<i>I got out, and I stabbed them tires</i>
<i>with everything I had in me.</i>

55:50.680 --> 55:53.183
Rosa, I don't… Get off the bus, Rosa.

55:53.725 --> 55:56.186
Rosa, don't sit there like…
Bus driver get back.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.645
You better open this door.

55:57.729 --> 56:00.315
Get off the bus, Rosa.
I'mma get you, Rosa.

56:00.398 --> 56:01.983
You see me, Rosa.

56:02.067 --> 56:06.279
Get Rosa off the damn bus. Rosa.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.074
That's all right. I'm picketing.
I'm taking a picture.

56:09.157 --> 56:11.576
I'm taking a picture of all this sh…
I see you, Rosa.

56:11.659 --> 56:13.703
This is Madea. It is 19…

56:13.787 --> 56:17.791
That's Rosa, Rosa Parks.
Y'all know her. I'm gonna post this in…

56:17.874 --> 56:22.379
It's 1955, but I'mma post it
as soon as I know what year the…

56:23.797 --> 56:26.508
I'mma post it one day,
but I'm taking it on my iPhone.

56:26.591 --> 56:28.968
I mean my aPhone
‘cause they didn't have iPhone back then,

56:29.052 --> 56:31.471
‘cause it was A before I, but…

56:31.554 --> 56:33.723
That's Rosa Parks,
and that's Archie back there.

56:33.807 --> 56:34.974
That's my man, Archie.

56:35.058 --> 56:38.436
She stole him from me, and I started
the Civil Rights Movement 'cause of this.

56:38.937 --> 56:41.564
I was like, "Rosa, get off the bus.
I just wanna talk to you."

56:41.648 --> 56:44.442
So she stayed on the bus.
The man got mad. White people got mad.

56:44.526 --> 56:46.903
Next thing I know,
Martin Luther King was there.

56:46.986 --> 56:49.406
Uh, Jesse Jackson, Millie Jackson.

56:49.489 --> 56:51.533
Uh, J… J… Little Janet was there.

56:51.616 --> 56:54.202
La Toya, Reba.
All them Jacksons were there marching

56:54.285 --> 56:56.329
and protesting down there in 1955.

56:56.913 --> 56:59.624
-What Rosa are you talkin' about?
-Rosa Parks.

57:00.208 --> 57:02.836
<i>-The</i> Rosa Parks?
-No, no, her name is Rose.

57:02.919 --> 57:06.214
Ain't no <i>the </i>Rose.
She became Rosa Parks after all of that.

57:06.297 --> 57:07.924
You know why Rosa didn't get off that bus?

57:08.007 --> 57:10.969
People think she was trying to help
Black people. That is not what happened.

57:11.052 --> 57:13.721
Only reason Rosa didn't get off,
she didn't wanna get her ass whooped,

57:13.805 --> 57:15.014
'cause she stole my man.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.349
-Okay.

57:16.433 --> 57:17.267
And now look.

57:17.350 --> 57:22.564
Look, Rosa Parks
is a whole entire Civil Rights hero.

57:23.273 --> 57:24.232
She’s a shero.

57:24.315 --> 57:25.608
And you know why she’s a shero?

57:25.692 --> 57:28.361
Because I would not let her
get off that bus.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.447
Next thing you know,
y'all can sit anywhere you want.

57:30.530 --> 57:31.990
Thank me. You're welcome. Praise Him.

57:32.073 --> 57:33.199
-Oh.
-Thank you.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.951
-Mm-hmm.
-Madea praise.

57:35.034 --> 57:38.955
That’s right. Thank you. I'm just saying
that all that bad that was,

57:39.038 --> 57:41.583
me… me mad at her
and wantin' to fight her, right?

57:41.666 --> 57:43.376
But look at the good that came out of it.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.713
Look at what has happened for Negroes
because of what I did. You understand?

57:46.796 --> 57:48.715
-Cause and effect.
-I did that. Right.

57:48.798 --> 57:52.135
So, when we get to the graduation,
I want you to have some cause and effect.

57:52.218 --> 57:57.265
Grab Sylvia and punch her
dead in her damn face at that graduation.

57:57.348 --> 58:00.435
Come on, come on. Where's your thug?
Get your inner thug out.

58:00.518 --> 58:03.688
If did that to Rose, then you do it too.
That was back in the day, baby.

58:03.771 --> 58:05.648
I was young and sexy. I was 20 years old.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.318
Okay. So if you were about 20 back then,

58:08.401 --> 58:12.238
if I do the math and I carry the one,
you'd be about 95 by now.

58:12.322 --> 58:15.783
Black don't crack.
Unless you're using it.

58:16.451 --> 58:19.913
I took this back in 19 and 55.
There it is. I took that picture.

58:21.206 --> 58:22.040
Okay.

58:22.624 --> 58:25.084
Ha ha. Proof is in the pudding.

58:42.519 --> 58:43.561
Yes, ma'am.

58:44.229 --> 58:45.063
Oh.

58:48.233 --> 58:49.776
Hmm. Get them dishes clean.

58:49.859 --> 58:51.778
-Well, hello.
-Hello, Cora.

58:51.861 --> 58:53.947
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Hello, Laura.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.490
How you doin'? How you feelin'?

58:55.573 --> 58:57.116
Terribly embarrassed.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.578
Uh, why? You didn't do anything
to feel embarrassed. It wasn't your fault.

59:00.662 --> 59:02.247
-We're so sorry.
-Yeah.

59:02.330 --> 59:05.542
Could… could I speak
to Madea alone, please?

59:05.625 --> 59:07.001
Sure, sure. Madea.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.545
-We can take this outside.
-Thank you.

59:08.628 --> 59:09.837
Yeah, come on, sit down, honey.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.006
-Can I help?
-Uh, sure. Take this.

59:12.090 --> 59:14.926
-Okay. Thanks.
-Come right over this way. Right this way.

59:15.009 --> 59:16.302
Good to see you, baby.

59:17.136 --> 59:19.597
-How you doin', hon?
-Hello, Madea.

59:19.681 --> 59:23.017
Ma… Madea, I'm very embarrassed
about last night.

59:23.101 --> 59:25.645
Honey, ain't nothing
to be embarrassed about. Okay?

59:25.728 --> 59:27.105
I was a foolish old woman.

59:27.188 --> 59:29.983
Don't worry. We all been
foolish old women for somebody.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.401
-We have.
-It's all right.

59:31.484 --> 59:33.778
-Yes. Oh, and thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

59:33.861 --> 59:37.490
You know, when you get old,
you get stiff and achy.

59:38.157 --> 59:40.034
Truth be told, that's why I use it.

59:40.118 --> 59:40.994
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

59:41.077 --> 59:43.454
-I woke this morning with no pains.
-Mm-hmm.

59:43.538 --> 59:45.873
Yeah,
I was singing and dancing.

59:45.957 --> 59:47.834
Yep, I wake up like that too.

59:47.917 --> 59:49.502
My nipples were like two bullets.

59:51.045 --> 59:53.131
I haven't felt that alive in years.

59:54.757 --> 59:56.551
Oh, you want some more, don't you?

59:57.135 --> 59:58.136
Oh, like an addict.

59:58.720 --> 1:00:01.514
Ok…  Okay. I'mma give it to you,

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:04.976
but you gotta be careful with this stuff.
Let me tell you, the key is this,

1:00:05.059 --> 1:00:08.021
you eat a little bit something before
then take a little now, a little later.

1:00:08.104 --> 1:00:10.857
-You got to microdose it, understand?
-Yes, thank you.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:13.067
Go on, take a little bit.
I'm just gonna give you one.

1:00:13.151 --> 1:00:14.569
-Thank you very much.
-Just one.

1:00:14.652 --> 1:00:17.947
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mmm.

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:19.699
Oh, that is gorgeous.

1:00:19.782 --> 1:00:22.535
Yep. You know, I make this myself.

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:24.787
-Do you?
-Yes, I got the recipe.

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:26.581
I'll give it to you,
but you gotta be careful

1:00:26.664 --> 1:00:30.043
because if you do too much, you'll get
five to ten. Be careful.

1:00:30.126 --> 1:00:32.712
-Thank you very much, you know.
-You welcome.

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:35.256
I think you and I are gonna become
very good friends.

1:00:35.340 --> 1:00:38.718
I believe that. I believe that.
I like you, Agnes Brown.

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:46.643
What? What was that? What'd she say?

1:00:50.146 --> 1:00:51.272
A bucket and a mop?

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:54.150
Honey, if it's that wet,
you need a gynecologist.

1:01:03.993 --> 1:01:05.203
Damn, that's violent.

1:01:05.286 --> 1:01:07.580
Maybe she's trying
to get a strep infection.

1:01:07.664 --> 1:01:10.541
My mother told me, if you do that,
you'll never be able to yodel.

1:01:12.001 --> 1:01:14.879
Ooh, these young people
so ratchet with these nasty songs.

1:01:14.962 --> 1:01:16.798
-Where's that coming from?
-I don't know.

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:18.841
I don't know what the world is coming to.

1:01:18.925 --> 1:01:21.761
-Young people these days.
-Young people listen to this.

1:01:22.512 --> 1:01:24.138
You ain't gonna believe we heard.

1:01:24.222 --> 1:01:26.307
-What?

1:01:26.391 --> 1:01:28.559
-What you looking for?
-Mabel.

1:01:28.643 --> 1:01:30.311
Looking for my phone.

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:32.772
-There it is.

1:01:33.314 --> 1:01:35.483
Excuse me. Hey, Lil Black.

1:01:36.442 --> 1:01:37.360
Say what?

1:01:38.277 --> 1:01:39.487
When? Tonight? Yeah.

1:01:39.570 --> 1:01:41.614
I guess she just has some wet ass--

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.991
Uh-uh. Don't. Don't. No. No. No.

1:01:47.453 --> 1:01:50.081
-So, uh, what do you think?
-It's great.

1:01:50.164 --> 1:01:51.666
No, it's not. I mean…

1:01:51.749 --> 1:01:54.293
You are such a perfectionist.

1:01:54.377 --> 1:01:56.671
-Yeah.
-Are you nervous?

1:01:56.754 --> 1:01:59.632
-Yes, very.
-Don't be. You're gonna kill it.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:02.677
Ah, thank you, man. You always on my side.

1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:05.555
-Oh, look at them hugging.
-Oh, ain't that cute?

1:02:05.638 --> 1:02:06.931
Look at you.

1:02:07.014 --> 1:02:09.475
-Look at you two. I see y'all.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.526
Uh, Bam. Bam! Bam!

1:02:18.609 --> 1:02:21.279
You do know
that's wedding music you playin', right?

1:02:21.362 --> 1:02:22.864
That's why I'm singin' it for 'em.

1:02:22.947 --> 1:02:25.700
I think they gonna tell us
they're getting married next.

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:27.535
Uh, congratulations.

1:02:27.618 --> 1:02:30.329
You know, when they call
your name at the graduation,

1:02:30.413 --> 1:02:33.750
<i>I'mma sing…
</i>

1:02:33.833 --> 1:02:36.836
Brown, you gonna lose
all your nuts singin' that high. Hush!

1:02:36.919 --> 1:02:38.337
-Way up high.
-You can do that.

1:02:38.421 --> 1:02:40.882
-I'm high. I always sing up there.
-You got support.

1:02:40.965 --> 1:02:43.092
Look, look at this.
Look, look, look, look.

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:44.886
-Oh Lord.
-Uh-uh.

1:02:44.969 --> 1:02:47.680
Make sure we cover…
Yeah, cover that up.

1:02:48.973 --> 1:02:51.142
-What the what?
-Yeah, uh-huh.

1:02:51.225 --> 1:02:53.352
Y'all look real good. Okay.

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:55.104
I like that color on her.

1:02:55.605 --> 1:02:56.939
What are they doin' here?

1:02:57.023 --> 1:03:00.067
Oh, I wanted my dad to come.
He said he had to bring her, so…

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:02.111
Tim.

1:03:02.195 --> 1:03:03.404
It… it's… it's fine.

1:03:03.905 --> 1:03:05.990
No, it's not fine. What…

1:03:06.073 --> 1:03:07.700
Does this not make you mad?

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:09.911
What are… what's really going on?

1:03:10.661 --> 1:03:11.537
I'm fine.

1:03:12.830 --> 1:03:13.790
You know what?

1:03:13.873 --> 1:03:15.458
Wait till Madea sees him.

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:17.543
That's what I told him. I said,

1:03:17.627 --> 1:03:21.172
"If I'm gonna make this damn coleslaw,
you ain't gonna be stealing my recipe."

1:03:21.255 --> 1:03:23.508
There she is.
All hell about to break loose now.

1:03:23.591 --> 1:03:24.634
What the hell?

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:28.262
I know damn well he not back up in here.

1:03:28.346 --> 1:03:31.808
-Madea, I asked him to come.
-What the hell you invite him up here for?

1:03:31.891 --> 1:03:33.726
What the hell you mean,
you asked him to come?

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:36.771
-Please. Do it for me?
-Boy, I don't know you like that.

1:03:36.854 --> 1:03:39.982
I never liked you. I know we kin,
but that don't mean we close.

1:03:40.066 --> 1:03:40.900
-Madea?
-What?

1:03:40.983 --> 1:03:42.735
I think you need
some more of your chocolate.

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:46.239
I done had too many. That's the problem.

1:03:46.322 --> 1:03:48.574
Oh, and… and here she come.

1:03:49.450 --> 1:03:50.701
Laura, can I talk to you?

1:03:50.785 --> 1:03:53.454
Hell, no, you can't talk to her.
She ain't got nothing to say to you.

1:03:53.538 --> 1:03:57.500
-Can we talk in private, please?
-No, you marrying her man in public.

1:03:57.583 --> 1:04:00.002
What the hell you want
to run to privacy now for?

1:04:00.086 --> 1:04:01.128
Let's talk in the open

1:04:01.212 --> 1:04:04.048
where all the people
can see what you're trying to say.

1:04:04.131 --> 1:04:06.592
Laura, I just wanna say that I'm sorry.

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:09.262
I didn't mean
to fall in love with him. It…

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:11.347
It just kinda happened.

1:04:11.430 --> 1:04:13.349
-Look at my face.
-Oh.

1:04:14.058 --> 1:04:15.560
I don't give a damn.

1:04:15.643 --> 1:04:16.727
Madea!

1:04:16.811 --> 1:04:19.313
Bye, girl. Bye, girl. Bye.

1:04:20.147 --> 1:04:22.942
And it's been killing me
because I didn't know how to tell you.

1:04:23.025 --> 1:04:26.362
C'mon, baby. You gonna hook up with him.
You could've hooked up with me here.

1:04:26.445 --> 1:04:28.322
I got what he got but bigger.

1:04:28.406 --> 1:04:29.323
Joe, shut up.

1:04:30.074 --> 1:04:31.742
But you do know I love you, right?

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:35.663
Take that thing you came with
and bounce out. I can't take no more.

1:04:35.746 --> 1:04:37.832
Tell her, Mabel!

1:04:37.915 --> 1:04:40.334
Tim, do you want us to leave?

1:04:40.418 --> 1:04:41.961
No, I want you to leave.

1:04:44.297 --> 1:04:46.048
-I'm talking to my son.
-I'm talking to you.

1:04:46.132 --> 1:04:48.217
-Tim.
-You are a sorry piece of--

1:04:48.301 --> 1:04:49.302
-Davi!
-Shit.

1:04:49.385 --> 1:04:51.012
-It's okay.
-No, I'm sick of this clown.

1:04:51.095 --> 1:04:52.388
-Clown?
-Richard.

1:04:53.431 --> 1:04:56.475
-Davi, why are you behaving this way?
-I'm sick of him.

1:04:56.559 --> 1:04:57.935
Uh-oh, gettin' ready to go down.

1:04:58.019 --> 1:04:59.520
Who you… who you talkin' to?

1:04:59.604 --> 1:05:01.397
I'm talking to the man
that had the audacity

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:03.441
to walk out on his family
and leave her in tears.

1:05:03.524 --> 1:05:05.401
-Baby.
-You don't know me, man.

1:05:05.484 --> 1:05:07.403
It'll be my pleasure
to beat the hell out of you.

1:05:07.486 --> 1:05:08.571
Davi, stop it!

1:05:08.654 --> 1:05:10.948
-Yes. Stop that now!
-I'm sick of him!

1:05:11.032 --> 1:05:12.408
What? Boy!

1:05:14.452 --> 1:05:16.662
-Stop it!

1:05:16.746 --> 1:05:18.497
Oh hell! Oh hell!

1:05:18.581 --> 1:05:19.957
-Oh yeah.
-Stop!

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:22.126
Oh my God!

1:05:24.795 --> 1:05:27.340
You knocked that girl down.
What's wrong with you?

1:05:27.423 --> 1:05:29.175
-Get Laura. Get Laura.
-Uh-oh.

1:05:29.258 --> 1:05:31.427
He hit my baby. Whoa, what the devil!

1:05:31.510 --> 1:05:32.637
Hold on, here!

1:05:35.473 --> 1:05:37.350
-Baby, you all right?
-Baby?

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:39.060
-Baby?
-That what he said?

1:05:39.143 --> 1:05:39.977
Are you okay?

1:05:40.061 --> 1:05:45.775
No, I think he was checking on Timmy.
'Cause, Timmy, ain't you his baby?

1:05:45.858 --> 1:05:47.985
Okay, what he calling her baby for?

1:05:48.069 --> 1:05:49.111
You wanna tell them?

1:05:49.195 --> 1:05:52.949
-Davi, not now. It's not the time.
-They told their secret. Let's tell ours.

1:05:53.032 --> 1:05:54.867
Tell us what? What's going on?

1:05:55.409 --> 1:05:56.369
Please.

1:05:57.745 --> 1:05:59.747
We've been seeing each other
for the past two years.

1:05:59.830 --> 1:06:01.499
-You--
-Oh, you got to be lying.

1:06:01.582 --> 1:06:02.416
Wait. What?

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:03.960
-Did you know about this?
-No.

1:06:04.043 --> 1:06:05.252
Davi, what?

1:06:05.836 --> 1:06:08.005
Wait, seeing each other?
What does that mean?

1:06:08.089 --> 1:06:10.424
I'll tell you what it mean.
They been fuckin'.

1:06:10.508 --> 1:06:11.968
-Joe!
-Uncle Joe!

1:06:12.051 --> 1:06:13.678
Oh, boy, you can't be mad at your mama

1:06:13.761 --> 1:06:16.931
'cause she gettin' that Similac
with vitamin… …D.

1:06:17.014 --> 1:06:20.017
Oh, I see you, Laura. I see you.

1:06:20.601 --> 1:06:26.065
Yeah. Now… now I know
why you not mad about them.

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:26.983
Right.

1:06:29.527 --> 1:06:32.822
<i>-Hey! Hey!
</i>

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:34.156
Mama, is that true?

1:06:38.452 --> 1:06:39.704
Yes, baby. It's true.

1:06:40.579 --> 1:06:42.540
Mabel, I'm so confused.

1:06:42.623 --> 1:06:45.084
I don't know… I don't know what to do.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:49.255
I thought the two boys was the lovers.

1:06:49.755 --> 1:06:52.216
Aunt Agnes, I'm s… sorry. I will explain.

1:06:52.299 --> 1:06:54.385
-No. No, you won't explain.
-Aunt Agnes…

1:06:54.468 --> 1:06:56.095
So you and my mother?

1:06:57.304 --> 1:06:58.472
We were gonna tell you.

1:06:58.973 --> 1:07:01.559
He was gonna tell me.

1:07:02.643 --> 1:07:06.063
This is wrong. He's… he's my age.
He's three years older than me.

1:07:06.731 --> 1:07:08.774
Wait a minute.

1:07:08.858 --> 1:07:10.359
You mad, ain't you, baby?

1:07:10.443 --> 1:07:12.445
"We the same age."

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:15.239
"He just three years older than me."

1:07:15.322 --> 1:07:17.658
You trying
to trick me, ain't you?

1:07:17.742 --> 1:07:21.245
That means y'all
not the same age.

1:07:21.328 --> 1:07:22.997
No, that ain't what he's…

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:26.375
He trying to trick me.
I'm… I'm high, but I ain't that high.

1:07:26.459 --> 1:07:28.711
Are you telling me
you seeing this li'l baby?

1:07:28.794 --> 1:07:29.879
You talkin' to me?

1:07:30.588 --> 1:07:32.006
Richard, you judging me?

1:07:32.089 --> 1:07:33.049
Hell, yeah.

1:07:33.799 --> 1:07:35.092
I mean, you're seeing this child.

1:07:35.176 --> 1:07:37.136
-What? You couldn't find a real man?
-Richard.

1:07:37.219 --> 1:07:39.847
Apparently, she couldn't get one
when she ran up on your ass.

1:07:39.930 --> 1:07:41.432
Damn, this is funny.

1:07:41.515 --> 1:07:43.934
You standing there
with my best friend,

1:07:44.018 --> 1:07:45.686
but you think this is funny.

1:07:45.770 --> 1:07:47.730
You wanna know what I find funny?

1:07:48.272 --> 1:07:51.484
Is how Sylvia helped me with my divorce,

1:07:52.735 --> 1:07:55.029
but you the one
who got away with everything.

1:07:55.112 --> 1:07:56.947
-There it is.
-Tell him, Laura.

1:07:57.031 --> 1:07:59.408
-Tell it, Laura.
-I got your back, baby. Tell it.

1:08:00.117 --> 1:08:01.827
You wanna know what else I find funny?

1:08:02.328 --> 1:08:04.872
How I'm gonna go down to her law firm
and tell them what she did.

1:08:05.498 --> 1:08:07.750
And that this is ineffective council.

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:10.753
And then I'mma haul
your ass down to the court

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:13.380
and get everything I got coming to me.

1:08:14.006 --> 1:08:16.133
Then we gonna see
who get the last "ha ha."

1:08:16.842 --> 1:08:18.302
Yeah, I'm seein' him.

1:08:18.385 --> 1:08:20.596
And let me tell you, this 26-year-old

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:23.432
is more of a man than you've ever been.

1:08:23.516 --> 1:08:26.393
And probably more of a man
than you ever can be.

1:08:26.477 --> 1:08:28.229
This man sees me.

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:29.814
This man hear me.

1:08:30.314 --> 1:08:33.192
And this man reminded me
that I'm alive and I can stand on my own

1:08:33.275 --> 1:08:34.902
before you tried to gut me.

1:08:35.694 --> 1:08:39.198
So maybe you can take some lessons
from this little 26-year-old

1:08:39.281 --> 1:08:41.158
with your little triflin' ass.

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:43.702
-She went off on him, didn't she?
-Yeah.

1:08:43.786 --> 1:08:45.412
-She went off.
-That's terrible.

1:08:45.496 --> 1:08:48.040
I guess she told you, stuck-ass.

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:49.291
That boy…

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:52.711
-That boy is--
-Is gonna be her husband.

1:08:52.795 --> 1:08:53.838
Oh.

1:08:53.921 --> 1:08:55.297
Oh. What?

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:57.049
-Oh.
-Wait a minute now.

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:57.967
What happened?

1:08:58.050 --> 1:08:59.510
-Baby.
-Ooh.

1:09:01.971 --> 1:09:03.889
Oh crap!

1:09:05.224 --> 1:09:07.393
This is no time for Black Lives Matter.

1:09:07.476 --> 1:09:09.478
Don't do that romantic shit.

1:09:10.062 --> 1:09:12.898
Player, don't do the romantic…
He on one knee.

1:09:12.982 --> 1:09:14.275
Davi, please.

1:09:15.943 --> 1:09:17.153
Say you'll marry me.

1:09:25.619 --> 1:09:26.453
Say yes.

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:28.914
Say yes.

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:32.376
And go!

1:09:33.043 --> 1:09:34.628
What the feck is going on?

1:09:35.713 --> 1:09:38.966
-I think it's beautiful.
-She's old enough to be his mother.

1:09:39.049 --> 1:09:41.886
Nobody ever won a race
in a second-hand car.

1:09:41.969 --> 1:09:43.512
But he loves her.

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:46.891
What would you know about love?
You couldn't get yourself a feckin' man.

1:09:46.974 --> 1:09:47.975
Arse.

1:09:53.022 --> 1:09:54.565
-Say yes.
-I gotta go.

1:09:55.232 --> 1:09:56.525
No.

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:59.445
That's embarrassing as hell.

1:10:03.991 --> 1:10:05.534
Baby, I think that's a no.

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:09.038
I see.

1:10:10.748 --> 1:10:11.874
I'm sorry.

1:10:11.957 --> 1:10:14.752
-She said, "I'm sorry."
-She said, "I'm…"

1:10:14.835 --> 1:10:16.670
You could've said something.

1:10:16.754 --> 1:10:18.547
She said, "I'm sorry."

1:10:18.631 --> 1:10:19.506
Yes.

1:10:19.590 --> 1:10:22.343
-That's like the <i>Runaway Bride.</i>
-What the hell was that? Poor baby.

1:10:22.426 --> 1:10:24.220
Mabel, leave him alone.

1:10:24.303 --> 1:10:26.096
She didn't have to do you
like that, man.

1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:28.140
I'm sorry. You down there
on one knee. I'm sorry.

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.517
-That's embarrassing.
-She could've said something.

1:10:30.601 --> 1:10:33.771
-Somethin' to him. Damn, I'm sorry.
-She didn't want to.

1:10:33.854 --> 1:10:36.106
-I'm sorry.
-That's none of your business. Eat.

1:10:36.190 --> 1:10:38.859
What the hell y'all watching them for?
Eat something. Hell.

1:10:38.943 --> 1:10:40.653
All up in my family business.

1:10:41.403 --> 1:10:44.365
Well, can you pass me a beer?

1:10:47.159 --> 1:10:49.495
-Laura?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

1:10:49.578 --> 1:10:51.538
-Baby--
-Look, I love him.

1:10:51.622 --> 1:10:53.082
Why didn't you say anything?

1:10:53.165 --> 1:10:56.835
There's just too much going on.

1:10:56.919 --> 1:11:00.297
What? You gotta figure out
what you wanna do.

1:11:00.923 --> 1:11:03.550
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1:11:03.634 --> 1:11:06.512
Well, then the only person
who can fix this is you.

1:11:08.472 --> 1:11:09.306
So fix it.

1:11:10.891 --> 1:11:11.767
Come on, baby.

1:11:23.821 --> 1:11:26.407
I didn't ask y'all
to bring y'all children here.

1:11:26.490 --> 1:11:28.492
This is a party for adults, half adults.

1:11:28.575 --> 1:11:30.286
-Not all adults.

1:11:30.369 --> 1:11:31.620
Flies.

1:11:32.121 --> 1:11:33.914
I should have changed me drawers.

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:37.960
Ooh, Agnes. You funny child.

1:11:38.043 --> 1:11:39.378
I need more "chocolate."

1:11:39.461 --> 1:11:40.921
-Do you?
-This stuff isn't kickin' in.

1:11:41.005 --> 1:11:42.339
I'm thinkin' about giving you one,

1:11:42.423 --> 1:11:44.967
but I want you to understand this,
and hear me good.

1:11:45.050 --> 1:11:47.052
This chocolate,
you gotta be careful with it.

1:11:47.136 --> 1:11:50.306
I remember one time I had too much,
and it snuck up on me all at once.

1:11:50.389 --> 1:11:54.059
Next thing I know, I found myself
in Mexico chained to a mule named Arriba.

1:11:54.143 --> 1:11:55.602
-Oh!
-Yes, honey.

1:11:55.686 --> 1:11:58.188
I was selling tequila
from between my breasts there.

1:11:58.272 --> 1:12:00.399
Didn't know what happened.
So I'mma give you one,

1:12:00.482 --> 1:12:03.610
but you gotta be responsible
for what happens to yourself.

1:12:03.694 --> 1:12:05.529
-Just the one.
-Okay.

1:12:05.612 --> 1:12:08.657
I don't know if I should.
Maybe I shouldn't.

1:12:08.741 --> 1:12:10.868
-You know you should.
-What is he thinkin' of, Davi?

1:12:10.951 --> 1:12:13.537
He has to come back to Ireland.
His granddad needs him.

1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:14.788
What?

1:12:15.372 --> 1:12:17.041
That was the deal back then.

1:12:17.791 --> 1:12:20.085
When Davi's parents passed away.
Lord rest them.

1:12:20.169 --> 1:12:21.754
Oh, yeah. Oh, rest them.

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:26.008
-I'll never forget his last words.
-Mmm. What was it?

1:12:26.091 --> 1:12:27.509
"Oh feck, it's a bus!"

1:12:29.678 --> 1:12:31.347
-Yeah. But…
-Well, it'll kill him.

1:12:31.430 --> 1:12:35.517
When they passed, the deal was
that Davi's granddad would run the farm

1:12:35.601 --> 1:12:37.519
until such time as Davi was old enough

1:12:37.603 --> 1:12:39.480
and the time was right
for him to take over.

1:12:39.563 --> 1:12:40.898
And the time is right now.

1:12:40.981 --> 1:12:42.191
-Oh.
-And he knows it.

1:12:42.274 --> 1:12:44.485
Oh, that's sweet. That's so sweet.

1:12:44.568 --> 1:12:46.862
But what if his heart
wants something else now, baby?

1:12:46.945 --> 1:12:47.905
Feck his heart.

1:12:49.073 --> 1:12:51.283
Sometimes I'm sorry I had six children.

1:12:51.909 --> 1:12:55.329
Listen, baby, these children
have their own lives to live, honey.

1:12:55.412 --> 1:13:00.042
-You got to let them live their life.
-I know, but they owe us.

1:13:00.125 --> 1:13:03.379
You can't tell me that your Cora
doesn't owe you something.

1:13:03.462 --> 1:13:05.130
Hell, yeah, she owe me.

1:13:05.214 --> 1:13:08.133
All them years I had to spend
on that pole trying to take care of her.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:11.720
Do you know how many splinters
I had to get removed from my inner thighs?

1:13:11.804 --> 1:13:12.805
Splinters?

1:13:12.888 --> 1:13:16.683
They didn't have brass poles back then.
Hos got it so easy right now.

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:19.186
Back in the day,
all we had was telephone poles.

1:13:19.269 --> 1:13:20.562
And they didn't shellac em'.

1:13:20.646 --> 1:13:23.941
You had to get on and ride that thing
and spin around and get that money.

1:13:24.024 --> 1:13:27.194
And I did. I paid for it.
Today my inside look like hell.

1:13:29.113 --> 1:13:30.364
But I paid. I… I took…

1:13:30.447 --> 1:13:33.367
Listen. I had to do
what I had to do, but I did it.

1:13:33.450 --> 1:13:35.536
He has to come back and run that farm.

1:13:35.619 --> 1:13:38.330
Let me ask you something.
What if that ain't his dream?

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:40.541
Feck his dream. He has to run that farm.

1:13:41.041 --> 1:13:44.586
How you gonna feel if that boy's
sittin' there runnin' the farm,

1:13:44.670 --> 1:13:47.005
milking all them bulls,
and he don't wanna be there.

1:13:47.089 --> 1:13:48.340
-Cows.
-Say what?

1:13:48.424 --> 1:13:50.050
Cows. Milking cows.

1:13:50.134 --> 1:13:52.052
Not milking a bull. Milking cows.

1:13:52.136 --> 1:13:53.804
Oh. Well, whatever the hell it is.

1:13:53.887 --> 1:13:56.598
What will it matter if he did
what you and his granddaddy want

1:13:56.682 --> 1:13:59.268
if his happiness is over here
in America with that girl?

1:13:59.351 --> 1:14:01.145
You know how hard it is to run a farm?

1:14:01.228 --> 1:14:03.730
How hard it is
to get a bull to mate with a cow?

1:14:04.231 --> 1:14:05.899
I had to French kiss a bull once.

1:14:05.983 --> 1:14:07.025
-Hmm.

1:14:07.109 --> 1:14:10.529
He wanted more, but I wasn't having it.
Well, not at that time.

1:14:11.572 --> 1:14:16.034
And all the cow shit to be cleaned up.
We sacrificed for him to be here.

1:14:16.118 --> 1:14:18.620
Listen to me.
Children gonna live their own lives

1:14:18.704 --> 1:14:19.955
whether we want 'em to or not.

1:14:20.038 --> 1:14:21.957
So either you can stand there
and be against 'em

1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:24.084
or stand there with 'em
while they make their mistakes

1:14:24.168 --> 1:14:27.129
or see if they gon' make a mistake
and help them. You understand?

1:14:27.212 --> 1:14:29.339
-Madea, thank you for the chat.
-What?

1:14:29.423 --> 1:14:30.966
-You're welcome.
-But I'm determined.

1:14:31.049 --> 1:14:33.051
Davi is coming back to Ireland with me.

1:14:33.635 --> 1:14:36.054
Ain't nothin' I can do.
I'mma give you a couple more candies,

1:14:36.138 --> 1:14:38.140
and we gon' see who gonna go
somewhere with somebody.

1:14:38.223 --> 1:14:40.809
Here, just take that bag, baby.
Enjoy yourself.

1:14:40.893 --> 1:14:42.019
We'll see who leavin'.

1:14:42.102 --> 1:14:44.354
Y'all come on in this house.
It's too hot out!

1:14:44.438 --> 1:14:46.607
-I gotta get this girdle off.
-I don't know if I should.

1:14:46.690 --> 1:14:49.359
Get these children outta my yard.
I don't know these children.

1:14:49.443 --> 1:14:52.696
And if you ain't bring no plates,
don't take no damn plates!

1:15:15.636 --> 1:15:16.803
I'm in love with her.

1:15:17.304 --> 1:15:19.473
Yeah, when were y'all gonna tell me that?

1:15:19.556 --> 1:15:22.184
I knew we had our graduation,
and you wanted to come out to them.

1:15:22.267 --> 1:15:24.186
So I wanted to give you
all the space you needed.

1:15:24.269 --> 1:15:25.187
Mmm.

1:15:25.270 --> 1:15:27.481
But it doesn't matter now.
She don't wanna marry me.

1:15:27.564 --> 1:15:31.360
Aw. It's just low-down, man.

1:15:31.443 --> 1:15:34.071
You know her, and you know me.
You know we're good for each other.

1:15:34.154 --> 1:15:38.492
How can you say that, Davi? Huh?
You've been lying to me this whole time.

1:15:38.575 --> 1:15:40.577
-I never lied to you.
-I don't know who you are.

1:15:40.661 --> 1:15:42.955
So, all the weekends you were gone,
you were with her?

1:15:44.289 --> 1:15:45.332
-Yes.
-O… okay.

1:15:45.415 --> 1:15:47.668
So that sounds like you lied to me.
You didn't tell me.

1:15:47.751 --> 1:15:49.294
She didn't want me to, but I wanted to.

1:15:49.378 --> 1:15:50.921
Oh, so you blame it all on her?

1:15:51.004 --> 1:15:52.339
No, I'm just telling you.

1:15:52.422 --> 1:15:56.093
You know what, man?
I don't have anything else to say to you.

1:15:56.176 --> 1:15:57.135
You can go.

1:15:57.219 --> 1:15:58.053
Tim.

1:15:59.179 --> 1:16:01.098
Why are you still standing here, dude?

1:16:01.181 --> 1:16:02.140
-I--
-Get up out of here.

1:16:02.224 --> 1:16:04.309
I'm your friend, and I love you.

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:05.644
You love my whole family.

1:16:05.727 --> 1:16:07.938
You go ahead and be mad. You deserve that.

1:16:08.814 --> 1:16:09.648
I just…

1:16:10.148 --> 1:16:12.484
I wanted to be there for you.
I didn't want to let you down.

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:13.986
-Mmm.
-I'm sorry.

1:16:16.154 --> 1:16:19.324
I'm your friend,
and I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

1:16:19.408 --> 1:16:21.535
Really?

1:16:21.618 --> 1:16:24.621
I love your mother. I'm sorry, but I do.

1:16:28.166 --> 1:16:29.418
I'm outta here.

1:16:30.586 --> 1:16:32.713
How you even say you wouldn't ever hurt me

1:16:32.796 --> 1:16:34.965
and you love my mother
in the same sentence?

1:16:35.048 --> 1:16:36.425
What's wrong with you, man?

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:52.441
Yeah, hold on.

1:16:54.359 --> 1:16:55.652
I'm just doin' some sewing.

1:16:55.736 --> 1:16:58.780
I can't stand it.
Have no damn company at my house.

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:01.074
Ok…

1:17:03.118 --> 1:17:03.994
Come on in.

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:06.580
Hey!

1:17:06.663 --> 1:17:07.581
Hi.

1:17:07.664 --> 1:17:10.542
I'm so glad you came to see me.
I was just sittin' here doin' nothin',

1:17:10.626 --> 1:17:13.545
waitin' for somebody to come talk to me.
Come on in. Sit down.

1:17:15.339 --> 1:17:18.467
-Hmm. How you doin', baby?
-I'm good.

1:17:18.550 --> 1:17:19.551
Good, good.

1:17:20.052 --> 1:17:22.471
Well, looks like I messed up

1:17:22.554 --> 1:17:25.641
my son's graduation celebration
once again.

1:17:25.724 --> 1:17:28.268
You sure the hell did.
You messed that shit up.

1:17:28.352 --> 1:17:31.897
No. I'm playin', girl.
You ain't messed nothing up.

1:17:31.980 --> 1:17:34.441
All the sacrifices you made
for that boy, hell.

1:17:34.524 --> 1:17:36.151
He'll be all right. He'll be fine.

1:17:36.234 --> 1:17:37.444
You sure about that?

1:17:37.527 --> 1:17:38.528
Yes, honey.

1:17:38.612 --> 1:17:41.490
You don't remember the sacrifices
you made? That's what a good parent do.

1:17:41.573 --> 1:17:43.950
From the time your baby born,
you sacrificin'.

1:17:44.034 --> 1:17:45.911
From kindergarten, you sacrificin'.

1:17:45.994 --> 1:17:48.705
First grade all the way up
through college, you been sacrificing.

1:17:48.789 --> 1:17:50.624
So after givin' them children
all that time,

1:17:50.707 --> 1:17:53.126
it's time you take care of yourself
and have you some damn fun.

1:17:53.210 --> 1:17:54.252
He gonna be fine.

1:17:55.504 --> 1:17:56.922
You talkin' about Davi?

1:17:57.005 --> 1:17:59.758
Yes, I am.
I knew something was going on with you,

1:17:59.841 --> 1:18:03.470
the way you coming up in here,
bouncing, talking about, "Hi."

1:18:03.553 --> 1:18:05.972
I know you was making you
happy or something.

1:18:07.057 --> 1:18:08.308
Well, it's not about him.

1:18:08.392 --> 1:18:10.018
You know? I mean, he's fun.

1:18:10.519 --> 1:18:15.232
But I'm just now starting to learn
how to love and be happy with myself.

1:18:15.315 --> 1:18:18.235
Then you on the right track.
That's exactly how it start.

1:18:18.318 --> 1:18:20.821
When you learn
how to be happy with your damn self.

1:18:20.904 --> 1:18:24.366
Yeah, I just… I can't marry him.
I mean, he's way too young.

1:18:25.367 --> 1:18:29.121
Honey, I been talking to that boy,
and he seem very mature.

1:18:29.204 --> 1:18:31.248
You understand?
Like he done been through some things.

1:18:31.331 --> 1:18:34.126
Sometimes trauma will grow you up
faster than a 50-year-old.

1:18:34.209 --> 1:18:36.378
-How'd you meet him?
-Oh, well…

1:18:36.461 --> 1:18:38.922
Look at you smiling.

1:18:39.005 --> 1:18:40.632
Oh, there's a good story right there.

1:18:40.716 --> 1:18:43.093
Oh, it's really simple. Easy.
I don't know where I…

1:18:43.176 --> 1:18:46.555
I went to visit Tim in college,
and my son always late.

1:18:46.638 --> 1:18:48.640
So he was late,
so I had to wait in the dorm, right?

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:52.394
So obviously, Davi's there,
and we just started talking.

1:18:52.477 --> 1:18:54.354
And I don't know, it was like…

1:18:55.147 --> 1:18:56.857
it was magical for some rea…

1:18:56.940 --> 1:19:01.987
Like, odd. Didn't know it at the time,
but like, we just kept talking and--

1:19:02.070 --> 1:19:05.115
Next thing, he was tapping that ass?
He tapping that ass?

1:19:05.198 --> 1:19:07.826
Tapping that ass,
speaking that Iranian…

1:19:07.909 --> 1:19:09.828
-Was he tapping?

1:19:09.911 --> 1:19:11.580
-It's just…
-I'm just clownin' you, girl.

1:19:11.663 --> 1:19:13.623
I can't have that conversation
with my grandmother.

1:19:13.707 --> 1:19:16.334
That's fine. That's fine.
I can teach you a few things.

1:19:16.418 --> 1:19:18.336
-But listen to me.

1:19:18.420 --> 1:19:21.006
I should've known
when I first looked at him look at you.

1:19:21.089 --> 1:19:22.215
That boy love you.

1:19:22.799 --> 1:19:23.759
He does, I know.

1:19:24.634 --> 1:19:28.805
But his great-aunt Agnes said
he's supposed to go to Ireland

1:19:28.889 --> 1:19:30.098
and run a farm.

1:19:30.182 --> 1:19:32.684
Like, a farm. He didn't tell me that.

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:36.438
-I didn't know you know that.
-Yeah, well, I know now.

1:19:36.521 --> 1:19:38.231
Agnes on that shit, just so you know.

1:19:38.315 --> 1:19:41.485
The shit I don't want her
to be on is being mad at me.

1:19:41.568 --> 1:19:44.905
Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Sounds like
you need to have a conversation.

1:19:44.988 --> 1:19:47.115
Talk to him about going
to Iran and everything.

1:19:47.199 --> 1:19:48.325
Ireland. Uh-huh.

1:19:48.408 --> 1:19:51.328
-That's what I said. Ire-land. Ire-land.
-Yep. You said it.

1:19:51.411 --> 1:19:53.538
Yeah, but, you know, talk to him about it.

1:19:53.622 --> 1:19:55.123
Maybe you can go over there with him.

1:19:55.207 --> 1:19:56.124
What?

1:19:56.208 --> 1:20:00.170
Baby, sometime you just gotta take
a chance on love. Love is worth it.

1:20:00.921 --> 1:20:02.464
You really think I should do that?

1:20:02.547 --> 1:20:05.300
What's keeping you here?
Your child is graduating.

1:20:05.383 --> 1:20:06.885
You sacrificed for him. Hell.

1:20:06.968 --> 1:20:09.638
And that damn raggedy car,
raggedy house of yours,

1:20:09.721 --> 1:20:10.889
that ain't worth keeping.

1:20:10.972 --> 1:20:14.059
You ain't got no man.
Your job is piss-poor.

1:20:14.142 --> 1:20:17.979
-Why not just go on over there with him?
-Yeah, my job is pretty bad.

1:20:18.063 --> 1:20:19.940
I don't know,
but that farm might be worse.

1:20:21.316 --> 1:20:24.361
Last time a Black woman was on a farm,
it didn't turn out too well, so…

1:20:24.945 --> 1:20:26.655
But just think about it.
Especially in Iran.

1:20:26.738 --> 1:20:29.282
-Yeah, I have my freedom papers this time.
-Mm-hmm.

1:20:29.366 --> 1:20:31.785
My question, though,
was that something you would do, Madea?

1:20:31.868 --> 1:20:33.495
I mean, should I really do that?

1:20:33.578 --> 1:20:35.413
What do you mean, baby? That's love.

1:20:35.914 --> 1:20:37.207
Love is worth it. Hell, yeah.

1:20:37.290 --> 1:20:39.459
I wouldn't do it at this age,
but when I was your age,

1:20:39.543 --> 1:20:41.711
I took some chances,
and that's why I live my life,

1:20:41.795 --> 1:20:45.048
now I ain't got no regrets.
I got out there, and I did the damn thing.

1:20:45.131 --> 1:20:47.676
Have fun. Just don't do nothin'
that's gonna ruin your life.

1:20:47.759 --> 1:20:49.886
But at least take some chances on love.

1:20:49.970 --> 1:20:52.305
That's love, baby.
That don't come around all the time.

1:20:52.389 --> 1:20:53.557
Yeah, I hear you.

1:20:53.640 --> 1:20:54.516
I'm just…

1:20:55.141 --> 1:20:59.688
Oh, I'm just scared.
I'm 12 years older than him, you know?

1:20:59.771 --> 1:21:04.276
I don't think it's age you worried about.
I think it's the heartbreak you done had.

1:21:04.359 --> 1:21:06.152
Let me tell you about heartbreak.

1:21:06.236 --> 1:21:08.738
It'll spit you out,
make you not wanna love nobody.

1:21:08.822 --> 1:21:11.116
It'll make you not wanna trust
nobody ever.

1:21:11.199 --> 1:21:13.159
That's what I tell women
when they get heart broke.

1:21:13.243 --> 1:21:16.079
If you get your heart broke,
please have the courage to try it again.

1:21:16.162 --> 1:21:18.748
If that person break your heart,
have the courage to try it again.

1:21:18.832 --> 1:21:21.251
Next person break your heart,
have the courage to try it again.

1:21:21.334 --> 1:21:23.461
I'm gonna tell you,
you keep getting your heart broke,

1:21:23.545 --> 1:21:25.338
pretty soon you gonna run up
on a heart surgeon

1:21:25.422 --> 1:21:28.049
who know how to fix all them breaks
you done been through.

1:21:28.133 --> 1:21:30.468
That's why you can't just stop, baby.

1:21:30.552 --> 1:21:32.929
Love is worth fighting for.
Do you hear me?

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:33.847
Yeah.

1:21:33.930 --> 1:21:36.600
So I get it. Get your heart broke,
don't wanna trust nobody else.

1:21:36.683 --> 1:21:39.311
Buildin' all them walls.
Let me tell you something about a wall.

1:21:39.394 --> 1:21:43.023
It'll keep everything out.
Stop building walls and build some fences

1:21:43.106 --> 1:21:46.318
so you can look over and see if that's
who you wanna see or not. Do you hear me?

1:21:48.278 --> 1:21:49.195
You're so wise.

1:21:49.821 --> 1:21:51.531
Thank you. I know.

1:21:51.615 --> 1:21:52.949
It's the weed.

1:21:53.033 --> 1:21:55.201
I'mma tell you this now,
speaking of wisdom,

1:21:55.285 --> 1:21:58.496
when you get married, make sure you
say "I do" to more than one person.

1:21:58.580 --> 1:22:01.875
"I do" to one person ain't gonna work.
You gotta say "I do" to several people.

1:22:01.958 --> 1:22:03.043
You understand?

1:22:03.126 --> 1:22:04.294
No, I do not.

1:22:04.377 --> 1:22:06.630
That's why so many people
are getting divorced these days.

1:22:06.713 --> 1:22:08.548
They just say "I do" to one person.

1:22:08.632 --> 1:22:11.259
Okay, I… I'mma take back
what I said about you being wise

1:22:11.343 --> 1:22:13.219
'cause I feel
like you're going off the rails.

1:22:13.303 --> 1:22:16.890
If you was high, you'd be with me.
But let me break it down for you.

1:22:16.973 --> 1:22:20.518
When you marry somebody, ten years later,
that person gonna be somebody else.

1:22:20.602 --> 1:22:23.563
Ten years after that, somebody else.
People evolve. They change.

1:22:23.647 --> 1:22:25.315
That's why so many people
renew their vows,

1:22:25.398 --> 1:22:28.693
'cause the person they say "I do" to
ain't the same person they with now.

1:22:28.777 --> 1:22:30.612
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

1:22:30.695 --> 1:22:33.531
Take a chance on love.
You gon' be all right.

1:22:33.615 --> 1:22:35.992
That boy too young to know,
but you old enough to understand.

1:22:36.076 --> 1:22:40.121
You old enough to know what I'm sayin'.
So, baby, y'all take your time, you hear?

1:22:40.205 --> 1:22:42.374
Now, if you don't mind, I was sewin'.

1:22:42.874 --> 1:22:45.543
I was, uh, net… net… I was net…

1:22:45.627 --> 1:22:48.338
Needle netting,
and I'd like to get back to it.

1:22:48.421 --> 1:22:50.256
-Would you mind just…?
-Yes.

1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:52.384
-Thank you. I love you.
-I love you too.

1:22:52.467 --> 1:22:55.136
You've been here a long time.
It's been over a day.

1:22:55.220 --> 1:22:58.640
-Almost time to go.
-All right. I figured my time was up.

1:22:58.723 --> 1:23:00.517
-Yeah, but I love you.
-I love you.

1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:02.936
-Talk to that boy, you hear me?
-I will.

1:23:03.019 --> 1:23:06.272
-Okay. Talk to him.
-All right. Enjoy your weed.

1:23:06.356 --> 1:23:08.191
Eh… Oh… How you know?

1:23:08.775 --> 1:23:10.318
You think I didn't smell that?

1:23:12.028 --> 1:23:16.282
I got a prescription
'cause it ain't legal in Georgia yet.

1:23:16.866 --> 1:23:19.452
Don't be telling your sister. Damn cop.

1:23:28.378 --> 1:23:30.755
This park close at nine o'clock, son.

1:23:30.839 --> 1:23:34.467
Nine o'clock. They trying to gentle-fy
the whole neighborhood.

1:23:34.551 --> 1:23:35.927
Yeah. Gentrified?

1:23:36.428 --> 1:23:38.430
Yeah, that's when they try
to make everything gentle.

1:23:38.513 --> 1:23:40.056
Like gentrified?

1:23:40.849 --> 1:23:42.434
That's what I said, gentle.

1:23:42.517 --> 1:23:44.811
They gon' make it gentle.
It used to be rough.

1:23:44.894 --> 1:23:46.896
That's why I go out and shoot in the air.

1:23:46.980 --> 1:23:49.315
I don't want nobody
to move here to make it gentle.

1:23:49.399 --> 1:23:51.484
-I like it rough, like it used to be.
-Got it.

1:23:51.568 --> 1:23:54.154
They come in here and raise
the property taxes and everything.

1:23:54.237 --> 1:23:55.280
Take over your damn house.

1:23:55.363 --> 1:23:57.449
Put basketball courts in,
change the neighborhood.

1:23:57.532 --> 1:23:59.993
Build pretty house all around.
I ain't selling shit.

1:24:00.076 --> 1:24:01.369
Gentrification.

1:24:01.870 --> 1:24:05.415
Whatever it is, I ain't selling.
I'mma hold on to what I paid for.

1:24:05.498 --> 1:24:06.875
-Got you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:24:06.958 --> 1:24:09.169
Uh, Madea, is my mom still up?

1:24:09.252 --> 1:24:10.211
Why?

1:24:10.295 --> 1:24:11.755
I gotta talk to her.

1:24:11.838 --> 1:24:14.424
No, your mama done had a rough day.
Go on home.

1:24:14.507 --> 1:24:17.635
-What about me?
-What about you? Don't go upsetting her.

1:24:17.719 --> 1:24:19.304
I'm not. I just wanna talk to her.

1:24:19.387 --> 1:24:21.890
You go home,
get ready for your graduation.

1:24:21.973 --> 1:24:25.101
Learn your speech, you understand?
Don't worry about this.

1:24:25.185 --> 1:24:28.605
Parents are not perfect.
Parents make all kind of mistakes.

1:24:28.688 --> 1:24:30.732
Your mom, your dad. Children think,

1:24:30.815 --> 1:24:33.568
"My mom should've been better.
My dad should've been better."

1:24:33.651 --> 1:24:35.153
They did the best they could.

1:24:35.236 --> 1:24:38.156
Just growing up, raising children,
nobody tell them how to do nothing.

1:24:38.239 --> 1:24:40.575
Sometime people just doin'
the best they can, you understand?

1:24:40.658 --> 1:24:42.786
-Yes, ma'am.
-You had no idea they was together?

1:24:42.869 --> 1:24:45.955
No, I mean, like,
he… he talks about her a lot,

1:24:46.039 --> 1:24:48.792
but I… I… I just never put it together.

1:24:48.875 --> 1:24:51.294
He talks about your mama a lot?

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:52.879
Yeah.

1:24:52.962 --> 1:24:53.963
-And… and…
-I mean…

1:24:54.047 --> 1:24:56.966
You didn't think something's goin' on?
Let me understand.

1:24:57.050 --> 1:24:59.803
Two children in college
talkin' about your mama,

1:24:59.886 --> 1:25:02.347
a man, and you don't think
something's goin' on?

1:25:04.849 --> 1:25:06.893
And, baby, you goin' to law school?

1:25:06.976 --> 1:25:09.938
-Listen to me. Do me a favor.

1:25:10.021 --> 1:25:12.982
Don't try no cases right now.
Don't do no criminal cases.

1:25:13.066 --> 1:25:15.527
Get some slip and falls.
Something you can handle.

1:25:15.610 --> 1:25:18.154
-I'm just gonna go talk to her.
-No. I said it.

1:25:18.238 --> 1:25:21.449
You ain't gonna talk to her.
You gon' go home and rest for tomorrow.

1:25:21.533 --> 1:25:23.868
Make all of us proud
with your big ol' speech.

1:25:23.952 --> 1:25:28.248
I… I'm gonna go stay at a friend's house.
I… I can't even look at Davi right now.

1:25:28.331 --> 1:25:31.000
So come on, come on.
Go on home. Come on, come on.

1:25:31.084 --> 1:25:32.043
Leave that basketball.

1:25:32.127 --> 1:25:34.921
I don't want people saying
we stole it from the gentri-people.

1:25:35.004 --> 1:25:37.090
Gentri-people trying to steal everything.

1:25:37.590 --> 1:25:39.592
-Open the gate for a lady.
-Yes, ma'am.

1:25:39.676 --> 1:25:41.386
-Pull it this way.
-This way?

1:25:41.469 --> 1:25:44.097
I can't get out of there.
Pull it this way.

1:25:44.180 --> 1:25:45.849
This ain't going through there.

1:25:45.932 --> 1:25:46.891
Go on home now.

1:25:46.975 --> 1:25:47.851
Okay.

1:25:52.730 --> 1:25:53.982
Derick Reed.

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:01.531
Tory Edwards.

1:26:01.614 --> 1:26:03.741
The graduation's taking a long time.
You like my dress?

1:26:03.825 --> 1:26:05.743
Oh, Miss Madea, you look very nice.

1:26:05.827 --> 1:26:09.414
Thank you. Thank you so much. I try.
I got this from Aretha Franklin.

1:26:09.497 --> 1:26:10.623
-It's beautiful.
-What?

1:26:10.707 --> 1:26:13.126
She willed it to me.
Aretha knew fashion, baby.

1:26:13.209 --> 1:26:15.295
-Wow.
-She willed it after she died.

1:26:15.378 --> 1:26:17.839
Yes, indeed. How's your mama doin'?

1:26:18.756 --> 1:26:22.343
She still has her knickers--
Her panties in a bunch.

1:26:22.427 --> 1:26:25.096
-Okay, panties, baby. Panties.
-She'll be fine.

1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.598
How you doin', Agnes?

1:26:26.681 --> 1:26:27.891
I'm fine.

1:26:27.974 --> 1:26:30.476
Don't look like you enjoying yourself,
twisted up in the mouth.

1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:34.522
No, no, no. It's not true.
The sooner this is over, the better.

1:26:34.606 --> 1:26:36.065
We can all get on that plane.

1:26:36.149 --> 1:26:37.817
-Including Davi.

1:26:37.901 --> 1:26:39.235
Mmm. Mmm.

1:26:39.319 --> 1:26:41.696
I think it got chilly
over here in the hot sun.

1:26:41.779 --> 1:26:45.533
-I'm sorry you didn't have a good time.
-Oh, I did. I did have a good time.

1:26:45.617 --> 1:26:46.659
I just… I…

1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:48.786
I wasn't expecting this.

1:26:48.870 --> 1:26:50.663
-Wait a minute, that's my baby.
-This?

1:26:50.747 --> 1:26:51.831
Incoming.

1:26:52.540 --> 1:26:54.959
Davi O'Malley!

1:26:55.043 --> 1:26:57.587
-Yes!

1:26:57.670 --> 1:26:59.756
-Proud of him.
-Well-done, Davi.

1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:03.176
Go, Davi!

1:27:03.259 --> 1:27:04.636
Okay. He know.

1:27:04.719 --> 1:27:09.098
-He isn't even looking at him.
-I know. I ruined his graduation too.

1:27:09.182 --> 1:27:10.308
No, you didn't.

1:27:10.391 --> 1:27:12.769
You ain't ruined nothing.
That boy be all right.

1:27:12.852 --> 1:27:16.064
He better be glad. All that money
we done spent putting him through sc…

1:27:16.147 --> 1:27:21.194
I spent $37.49
putting that boy through school.

1:27:21.277 --> 1:27:23.404
Timothy Marshall!

1:27:28.201 --> 1:27:29.953
You did it! You did it!

1:27:33.498 --> 1:27:36.751
That's my baby! That's my baby boy!

1:27:40.338 --> 1:27:41.256
Yes!

1:27:41.339 --> 1:27:43.007
Go, Tim!

1:27:43.091 --> 1:27:44.550
Y'all get the picture? Smile.

1:27:44.634 --> 1:27:46.803
-He ain't smile? Did he get the diploma?
-Yes.

1:27:46.886 --> 1:27:49.097
Great. I'm getting ready
to go and whoop her ass.

1:27:49.180 --> 1:27:51.140
Madea, would you just stay seated?

1:27:51.224 --> 1:27:53.393
Don't do that at the graduation.

1:27:53.476 --> 1:27:54.936
-Yes!
-Don't do that.

1:27:55.019 --> 1:27:56.854
-That's right!
-You already ruined two dinners.

1:27:56.938 --> 1:27:59.565
-Oh my God.
You got to act up everywhere you go.

1:27:59.649 --> 1:28:01.276
-You know what you ruined?
-What?

1:28:01.359 --> 1:28:03.861
My appetite with that ugly ass suit.
Please be quiet.

1:28:03.945 --> 1:28:05.822
Will you stop? He has to say his speech.

1:28:05.905 --> 1:28:07.991
I'm tired of you
talking to me like a child.

1:28:08.074 --> 1:28:10.368
-I don't meant to ta--
-I'mma take you to the cane.

1:28:10.451 --> 1:28:12.578
I don't mean to talk
to you like a kid, Madea,

1:28:12.662 --> 1:28:14.330
but this is a big day for him!

1:28:14.414 --> 1:28:16.124
-The way she actin'.
-Shut up.

1:28:16.207 --> 1:28:19.669
Now, we are pleased to present
the valedictorian of our graduating class,

1:28:19.752 --> 1:28:21.421
Timothy Marshall.

1:28:23.256 --> 1:28:27.176
-Yeah! Valedictorian!
-That's my son! That's my son!

1:28:27.802 --> 1:28:30.179
-That's my son!
-He about to say his speech.

1:28:30.263 --> 1:28:32.265
-He about to say his speech.
-That's mine.

1:28:32.348 --> 1:28:35.351
"That's your son."
He done talking about that's his son.

1:28:35.435 --> 1:28:36.644
Well, it ain't your son.

1:28:36.728 --> 1:28:40.023
You ain't did a thing for him.
Talk about your son. Hush! Hush!

1:28:42.442 --> 1:28:44.777
-He ain't saying his speech?
-He ripped it up.

1:28:44.861 --> 1:28:46.446
What he gon' say now?

1:28:46.529 --> 1:28:48.614
Maybe he got it memorized.
He got it memorized.

1:28:48.698 --> 1:28:49.574
Maybe so.

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:54.078
I was gonna get up here
and talk about life

1:28:54.662 --> 1:28:57.999
and all of the great things that await us.

1:28:58.833 --> 1:29:00.543
About jobs, about hope.

1:29:01.961 --> 1:29:03.963
But these last two days, you guys,

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:08.134
I was lied to by my best friend.

1:29:08.217 --> 1:29:13.931
Well, I shouldn't say lied to.
Deceived by him and my mother.

1:29:14.015 --> 1:29:15.224
-Oh.
-Yep.

1:29:15.308 --> 1:29:16.142
Ooh.

1:29:16.225 --> 1:29:19.187
-You see, I didn't know they were dating.
-Oh my gosh.

1:29:19.270 --> 1:29:21.731
-Put all our business--
-He putting all this in the street.

1:29:21.814 --> 1:29:23.232
He don't have to say all that.

1:29:23.316 --> 1:29:25.651
-Are you recording it?
-Yeah.

1:29:25.735 --> 1:29:28.988
I spent all of last night mad.

1:29:29.906 --> 1:29:32.825
Mad at them. Mad that I didn't know.

1:29:32.909 --> 1:29:36.621
But then I… I… I realized that I, too,

1:29:37.121 --> 1:29:38.539
am harboring a secret.

1:29:38.623 --> 1:29:41.084
At… at… at least
I thought it was a secret.

1:29:41.167 --> 1:29:43.628
My whole family already knew.

1:29:43.711 --> 1:29:45.046
Yeah, we knew. We knew.

1:29:45.630 --> 1:29:48.007
You see, I'm gay,

1:29:48.091 --> 1:29:51.344
and I was really worried
about what they would think.

1:29:51.427 --> 1:29:53.179
I didn't care what I thought.

1:29:53.971 --> 1:29:56.724
When I came out to them,
they showed me so much love,

1:29:56.808 --> 1:30:00.728
and it… it just made me realize
how fortunate I am to have them.

1:30:01.729 --> 1:30:05.483
And so, as we start
this bright future of ours,

1:30:06.317 --> 1:30:10.613
I just want to take the time
to thank my mother, who always loved me,

1:30:10.696 --> 1:30:15.410
stood by me, worked, did whatever
she could to help put me through school.

1:30:16.702 --> 1:30:20.915
-And to my dad, thank you.
-He ain't done nothing for you.

1:30:20.998 --> 1:30:22.291
-Madea.
-What?

1:30:22.375 --> 1:30:23.209
Agree.

1:30:23.709 --> 1:30:26.712
Even though they were divorced
and he didn't have much,

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:29.090
he still tried to be there for me.

1:30:29.173 --> 1:30:32.301
And to my best friend Davi,

1:30:32.385 --> 1:30:34.887
who never once judged me

1:30:34.971 --> 1:30:36.389
but was always a friend.

1:30:36.889 --> 1:30:40.977
Even though he was sneaking around
with my mother.

1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:41.894
Damn.

1:30:41.978 --> 1:30:43.729
-Why does he keep saying that?
-I mean…

1:30:43.813 --> 1:30:45.857
-'Cause he was.
-He was whoring around.

1:30:45.940 --> 1:30:48.776
He talk too damn much. What goes on
in the house stay in the house.

1:30:48.860 --> 1:30:49.777
Amen!

1:30:49.861 --> 1:30:53.197
I thought about what kind of guy he is.

1:30:53.281 --> 1:30:55.950
He's mature. He's a good man.

1:30:56.033 --> 1:31:00.037
And I thought to myself, how lucky am I

1:31:00.121 --> 1:31:02.999
that the two people I love
the most in this world

1:31:03.082 --> 1:31:05.209
found each other because of me.

1:31:06.335 --> 1:31:07.795
Would I rather have known?

1:31:07.879 --> 1:31:09.130
-Yes.

1:31:09.213 --> 1:31:11.674
But I'm okay with it.

1:31:11.757 --> 1:31:14.427
And I wanna apologize
to them for how I acted.

1:31:15.845 --> 1:31:19.182
A future isn't a future without a past.

1:31:20.850 --> 1:31:23.811
And I'm just so thankful
that I have a family.

1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:26.314
For my great-grandmother, Madea.

1:31:26.397 --> 1:31:30.318
My grandma, Cora,
Mr. Brown, Aunt Ellie, Aunt Bam.

1:31:30.401 --> 1:31:32.653
And of course, Uncle Joe.

1:31:32.737 --> 1:31:35.656
Baby, Joe ain't here.
He was too high to come.

1:31:35.740 --> 1:31:38.701
And I just wanna let the world know that

1:31:39.785 --> 1:31:43.748
I love them,
and I'm so thankful to be born to them.

1:31:43.831 --> 1:31:45.500
And as we start this future,

1:31:45.583 --> 1:31:50.004
I start mine standing on the shoulders
of regular, hardworking people

1:31:50.087 --> 1:31:51.589
who didn't have much.

1:31:51.672 --> 1:31:53.257
They are giants to me.

1:31:54.133 --> 1:31:56.260
And I love them with my whole heart.

1:31:57.178 --> 1:31:58.012
Thank you.

1:32:04.727 --> 1:32:05.895
Beautiful.

1:32:06.604 --> 1:32:08.940
-Tim, Tim, Tim!
-Thank you, Jesus.

1:32:10.483 --> 1:32:11.609
Yes.

1:32:18.324 --> 1:32:19.909
Hallelujah!

1:32:22.954 --> 1:32:26.290
-That was all right. That was beautiful.
-That was beautiful.

1:32:26.374 --> 1:32:28.000
-Yes, it was.
-Yeah.

1:32:31.462 --> 1:32:33.673
-Hey.
-Hey. Come with me.

1:32:35.967 --> 1:32:38.511
I thought I was the one
with the big secret.

1:32:38.594 --> 1:32:41.847
Oh.
We didn't wanna hurt you, baby.

1:32:42.848 --> 1:32:43.849
Do you love him?

1:32:45.142 --> 1:32:46.769
Yes, I do.

1:32:49.230 --> 1:32:50.314
Do you love her?

1:32:50.398 --> 1:32:51.857
Yes, I do.

1:32:54.068 --> 1:32:55.403
You should've told me.

1:32:55.486 --> 1:32:56.571
I… I know. I'm sorry.

1:32:57.738 --> 1:33:00.116
We're sorry. I'm sorry.

1:33:00.658 --> 1:33:03.035
Look, trust me. We were gonna tell you.

1:33:04.954 --> 1:33:06.789
Don't… don't be sorry. I…

1:33:06.872 --> 1:33:09.208
I know what it's like to have a secret,

1:33:09.292 --> 1:33:12.878
and I feel so good now
that my family knows.

1:33:12.962 --> 1:33:16.424
And I… I don't want you to hide it.

1:33:17.675 --> 1:33:20.094
I'm so proud of you, baby.
I stay proud of you. Come here.

1:33:20.177 --> 1:33:21.887
-I love you.
-I love you.

1:33:23.598 --> 1:33:25.808
-I'm not calling you Dad.
-I wouldn't want you to.

1:33:25.891 --> 1:33:27.268
And… and if you hurt her…

1:33:27.351 --> 1:33:29.687
-Hey.
-I wouldn't do that.

1:33:29.770 --> 1:33:32.440
But it doesn't matter now.
She won't marry me.

1:33:33.149 --> 1:33:33.983
What?

1:33:34.066 --> 1:33:36.861
Mom, you… you just said you loved him.
What's the problem?

1:33:36.944 --> 1:33:39.822
He has to go back to Ireland.

1:33:39.905 --> 1:33:42.074
His great-aunt made that very clear to me.

1:33:42.158 --> 1:33:43.075
What?

1:33:43.159 --> 1:33:44.619
Is that why you said no?

1:33:44.702 --> 1:33:47.496
Well, I don't want us
to be a rift in your family.

1:33:47.580 --> 1:33:50.791
-Don't you--
-Oh, Davi, son, congratulations.

1:33:50.875 --> 1:33:54.462
You did the family
and the whole country of Ireland proud.

1:33:54.545 --> 1:33:57.590
Thank you.
Aunt Agnes, I need to speak with you.

1:33:57.673 --> 1:34:00.426
There's nothing left to be said, son.
I'm delighted to be here.

1:34:00.509 --> 1:34:01.802
And I'm delighted you were here.

1:34:01.886 --> 1:34:02.720
Well, there we go.

1:34:02.803 --> 1:34:05.222
Mummy, will you let Davi speak, please.

1:34:05.806 --> 1:34:08.768
-Thanks, Cathy. I--
-Go on, say what you want to say.

1:34:08.851 --> 1:34:10.895
-I knew I was--
-Wait, hold on a second.

1:34:10.978 --> 1:34:12.521
I forgot your card.

1:34:12.605 --> 1:34:14.982
-Here's your graduation present. Open it.
-What…

1:34:20.112 --> 1:34:21.113
What's this?

1:34:22.615 --> 1:34:25.242
-It's your ticket to Ireland. Canceled.
-What?

1:34:26.869 --> 1:34:27.787
-But--
-But nothing.

1:34:28.746 --> 1:34:30.706
Davi, you know how much
I want you to come home,

1:34:30.790 --> 1:34:33.709
and you know how much
I respect family tradition.

1:34:33.793 --> 1:34:35.961
But a wise woman told me,

1:34:36.045 --> 1:34:40.007
"Children have to live their own lives.
They have to make their own decisions."

1:34:40.633 --> 1:34:43.177
And she said something about
being a Black whore's…

1:34:43.260 --> 1:34:44.887
Anyway, that's irrelevant.

1:34:44.970 --> 1:34:46.055
The thing is,

1:34:47.348 --> 1:34:48.557
your life is here, son.

1:34:49.725 --> 1:34:51.560
And I think your happiness is here too.

1:34:52.395 --> 1:34:54.522
-And that's all I want for you.

1:34:56.941 --> 1:34:59.110
Oh, that's good. That's, like…

1:34:59.193 --> 1:35:00.528
That's so good.

1:35:04.115 --> 1:35:06.617
So you don't mind
if we get married?

1:35:06.701 --> 1:35:08.661
I don't think
that's a question for Aunt Agnes.

1:35:08.744 --> 1:35:11.205
I think that's a question
for the beautiful lady right here.

1:35:11.288 --> 1:35:12.707
What you got to say?

1:35:14.125 --> 1:35:14.959
Laura…

1:35:15.751 --> 1:35:17.878
Don't you get down on your knee again.

1:35:17.962 --> 1:35:19.171
She already said no.

1:35:19.255 --> 1:35:21.132
Yeah, you done embarrassed yourself once.

1:35:21.215 --> 1:35:22.466
-Would you two hush?
-But Cora--

1:35:22.550 --> 1:35:25.219
-You wasting time.
-He can propose and marry my daughter.

1:35:25.302 --> 1:35:26.929
I'm keeping him from embarrassing himself.

1:35:27.012 --> 1:35:29.140
Yeah, I'mma take a picture.
Hush. Go ahead, baby.

1:35:29.223 --> 1:35:30.474
-Do it. Do it
-Just ask.

1:35:30.558 --> 1:35:32.560
-I'mma see if she gon' say yes.
-Laura.

1:35:33.060 --> 1:35:35.896
Will you marry me?

1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:36.939
Shh.

1:35:37.940 --> 1:35:39.066
Yes.

1:35:39.150 --> 1:35:41.068
-Yes!
-Yes!

1:35:41.152 --> 1:35:44.697
Yes, we'll marry you.
Yes, we'll marry you.

1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:49.201
I want you to tie that knot.
And y'all will go to holy mattresmony.

1:35:49.285 --> 1:35:51.871
-What are you gonna tell his grandpa?
-Nothing.

1:35:51.954 --> 1:35:53.080
Nothing?

1:35:53.164 --> 1:35:54.874
His granddad is in jail.

1:35:54.957 --> 1:35:57.585
He was found in a hotel room
naked with a drunk sheep.

1:35:57.668 --> 1:35:59.044
-Shut…
-What?

1:35:59.128 --> 1:36:00.421
-A sheep?
-Hmm.

1:36:00.504 --> 1:36:02.131
-That's nasty.
-Yeah.

1:36:02.757 --> 1:36:05.092
He brought the sheep in hisself?

1:36:05.176 --> 1:36:08.220
-No, no. It was a… it was a… a blind date.
-Oh.

1:36:08.304 --> 1:36:10.347
I done seen that movie and the sequel.

1:36:10.431 --> 1:36:12.057
-Ooh!

1:36:13.684 --> 1:36:15.269
I love you, Aunt Agnes.

1:36:15.352 --> 1:36:18.272
-I know, son, and I love you.
-Congratulations.

1:36:18.355 --> 1:36:21.066
Now, we have a plane to catch.
Cathy, come on.

1:36:21.150 --> 1:36:22.401
That is so nice.

1:36:22.485 --> 1:36:25.279
God bless y'all.
I'm so proud of y'all. Whoo!

1:36:25.362 --> 1:36:27.198
-Laura.
-Where's Madea?

1:36:27.281 --> 1:36:29.200
Over there asleep.

1:36:29.283 --> 1:36:31.243
I wanna say goodbye. Cathy, come on.

1:36:32.077 --> 1:36:32.912
Wait here.

1:36:32.995 --> 1:36:35.206
Oh, baby, I'm so proud of you.

1:36:35.289 --> 1:36:37.082
Man, let me do y'all wedding.

1:36:37.166 --> 1:36:41.128
Mmm. Yeah. Jay, thank you, Jay.

1:36:41.212 --> 1:36:42.087
Madea.

1:36:42.671 --> 1:36:46.801
Oh, you… you scared me.
I fell asleep on that indica. Mmm.

1:36:46.884 --> 1:36:48.260
-Is it over?
-Yes.

1:36:48.761 --> 1:36:50.221
Oh, okay. Okay.

1:36:50.304 --> 1:36:52.348
-We have to get to the plane.
-Mmm.

1:36:52.431 --> 1:36:53.599
I'm letting Davi stay.

1:36:53.682 --> 1:36:55.518
I knew you would.
That is the right thing to do.

1:36:55.601 --> 1:36:56.852
I knew you'd do the right thing.

1:36:56.936 --> 1:36:58.604
Madea, thanks very much.

1:36:58.687 --> 1:37:01.398
You were a wonderful hostess,
and thank you for the talks--

1:37:01.482 --> 1:37:03.067
I'm a wonderful ho-stess?

1:37:03.150 --> 1:37:04.652
Ho-stess.

1:37:04.735 --> 1:37:07.863
Oh, that's hos, plural.
Okay, yes. I get it.

1:37:07.947 --> 1:37:10.908
Thank you so much for the talks,
and thank you for the recipe.

1:37:10.991 --> 1:37:12.785
Oh, you welcome. Don't go to jail.

1:37:12.868 --> 1:37:15.287
You get five to ten
if you make too much.

1:37:15.371 --> 1:37:18.290
When you gonna come across the pond?
Come and visit us.

1:37:18.374 --> 1:37:20.042
-Hmm.
-It'd be nice to show you around.

1:37:20.125 --> 1:37:21.961
-I'll show you everywhere.
-Hmm.

1:37:22.044 --> 1:37:24.672
Maybe Mrs. Brown and Madea do Europe.

1:37:24.755 --> 1:37:26.715
-Ooh, I love that.

1:37:26.799 --> 1:37:28.467
I can't wait to show you
my beloved Ireland.

1:37:28.551 --> 1:37:31.971
Oh, you had me till you started talking
about Iran. Baby, I can't go to Iran.

1:37:32.054 --> 1:37:35.558
-Ireland.
-I know, too much sand in that Iran-land.

1:37:35.641 --> 1:37:37.518
Fuck's sake.

1:37:37.601 --> 1:37:38.853
-Whatever.
-Mmm.

1:37:38.936 --> 1:37:41.146
-Right. Well, I better go.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:37:41.230 --> 1:37:43.607
-Thanks for everything.
-You travel safe. Fly.

1:37:43.691 --> 1:37:45.067
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:37:45.150 --> 1:37:48.153
Listen. Thank you so much
from the bottom of my heart.

1:37:48.237 --> 1:37:49.071
I appreciate it.

1:37:49.154 --> 1:37:51.490
-Thank you.
-I'm high as hell, or I'd walk you out.

1:37:51.574 --> 1:37:53.701
-I'm going now.
-Okay, I gotta find the steps.

1:37:53.784 --> 1:37:55.953
That's why I falled asleep up here.
I'm high as hell.

1:37:56.036 --> 1:37:57.204
-Okay.
-I love you.

1:37:57.288 --> 1:37:58.289
I love you too.

1:37:58.372 --> 1:37:59.415
I love you too.

1:37:59.498 --> 1:38:01.041
-Bye.
-Bye, Agnes.

1:38:01.125 --> 1:38:03.335
-I just wanted to say goodbye.
-You did, baby.

1:38:03.419 --> 1:38:05.170
-Oh, did I?
-Twice. Okay. All right.

1:38:05.254 --> 1:38:07.464
You all up in my space. Bye.

1:38:08.173 --> 1:38:10.426
Mabel, did you…
What you dreaming up here about?

1:38:10.509 --> 1:38:13.596
-Baby, I had that good-good.
-Really?

1:38:36.035 --> 1:38:37.244
Yeah!

1:39:04.188 --> 1:39:05.773
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1:39:25.584 --> 1:39:27.002
What you think is better?

1:39:27.086 --> 1:39:28.796
I mean, I think we could use

1:39:28.879 --> 1:39:30.923
another "Drunk in Love"
swag sort of run-through.

1:39:31.006 --> 1:39:32.299
Yep, I agree. I agree.

1:39:32.967 --> 1:39:36.261
And get all departments,
people who haven't seen the show,

1:39:36.345 --> 1:39:39.181
like seen it from the top,
are super unclear of what the vibe is.

1:39:39.264 --> 1:39:41.141
What she walk in front of me for?
I'm talking.

1:39:41.225 --> 1:39:42.851
You just gonna walk in front of me?

1:39:43.602 --> 1:39:44.603
Yeah, I'm with you.

1:39:44.687 --> 1:39:47.147
Let's get all departments
so we can feel each other energy.

1:39:47.231 --> 1:39:49.191
Okay. What time is it?

1:39:49.274 --> 1:39:52.820
-Six-thirty.
-Okay. And what time we gotta leave?

1:39:53.612 --> 1:39:54.571
At eight.

1:39:54.655 --> 1:39:56.699
That's enough time.
We can try to get most of it too.

1:39:56.782 --> 1:39:57.658
Okay. Fine.

1:39:57.741 --> 1:39:59.743
Okay, well, let's do it. Let's go.

1:41:07.019 --> 1:41:10.147
God, we thank you right now
for your blessin'

1:41:10.230 --> 1:41:13.942

1:41:14.026 --> 1:41:17.571

1:41:17.654 --> 1:41:20.741
Uh, not all of 'em.
Couple… couple of them beau…

1:41:20.824 --> 1:41:25.245
Uh, but we want to thank you

1:41:25.329 --> 1:41:28.832

1:41:28.916 --> 1:41:32.211

1:41:32.795 --> 1:41:34.880
Thank y'all for Mache… Machella.

1:41:43.138 --> 1:41:46.391
We want to make sure
that y'all goin' through all the steps

1:41:46.475 --> 1:41:49.686
'cause there's about five or nine
of y'all missing in between 11 and 12,

1:41:49.770 --> 1:41:52.773
but it's a little janky right now,
but y'all gonna get it.

1:41:52.856 --> 1:41:56.944
And I want y'all to know that everything
y'all doing, I really appreciate…

1:41:57.027 --> 1:42:00.823
Ooh, I can't breathe like this,
but I appreciate y'all what y'all doin'.

1:42:00.906 --> 1:42:04.993
But… but this is beautiful. Beautiful.
We just beautiful people.

1:42:05.077 --> 1:42:09.581
I love the beauty of the beautiful people,
of all of us just bein' together.

1:42:15.087 --> 1:42:19.216
It's so good. It's so good.
Stop clappin', hell. Stop clappin', hell.

1:42:20.843 --> 1:42:22.845
That's why y'all…
You won't stop clappin'

1:42:22.928 --> 1:42:24.972
when I say stop.
That's why you can't learn the steps.

1:42:25.055 --> 1:42:27.891
If I say one, two, three, four, five,
y'all going one, two, four, five.

1:42:27.975 --> 1:42:30.310
You got to go one, two, three, four, five.

1:42:30.394 --> 1:42:33.063
Learn somethin'.
Learn somethin', children.

1:42:33.147 --> 1:42:35.858
I'm trying to teach y'all
so y'all be ready for the future.

1:42:35.941 --> 1:42:37.359
One, two, three, four, five.

1:42:38.193 --> 1:42:40.571
Gotta try. One, two, three, four, five.

1:42:40.654 --> 1:42:43.240
Let me see it.
One, two, three, four, five.

1:42:43.740 --> 1:42:45.409
Okay, I think y'all ready.

1:42:45.492 --> 1:42:48.203
So all we're gonna do is
feel each other's energy.

1:42:48.287 --> 1:42:49.413
We just gonna do it, okay?

1:42:49.496 --> 1:42:52.291
We just gonna do it. We gonna feel
each other energy, and we gonna do it.

1:42:52.374 --> 1:42:53.792
All right? Okay.

1:42:56.295 --> 1:42:59.882
My voice just went out.

1:42:59.965 --> 1:43:00.799
Okay.

1:43:49.348 --> 1:43:51.975
We got to get the energy right.
We gotta do it right.

1:43:52.059 --> 1:43:54.853
'Cause the oohs and ahs,
and we gotta make sure

1:43:54.937 --> 1:43:57.147
that it's all coming together.

1:43:57.231 --> 1:43:59.274
Yeah, I don't feel it. I don't feel it.

1:43:59.358 --> 1:44:02.861
I don't understand. You want me to keep
givin' notes, but y'all not replying.

1:44:02.945 --> 1:44:03.946
If you reply my notes,

1:44:04.029 --> 1:44:06.990
if you put my replyplication to the notes,
then we do it.

1:44:07.074 --> 1:44:10.035
Don't make no sense to give notes
if you not gonna reply to my notes.

1:44:10.118 --> 1:44:11.495
Y'all gotta reply to the notes.

1:44:32.724 --> 1:44:33.976
What did she say?

1:45:01.753 --> 1:45:05.924
Madea! Madea! Madea! Madea!

1:45:06.008 --> 1:45:12.431
We rehearsed for four hours
before we went on stage.

1:45:12.514 --> 1:45:15.976
Then we rehearsed for four more hours
after we was done with the show

1:45:16.059 --> 1:45:17.894
to see all the things we did wrong.

1:45:17.978 --> 1:45:19.021
Thank you.
