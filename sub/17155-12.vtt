<i>Previously on</i> Jonas LA...

00:01.667 --> 00:03.667
Mantra wants to meet with me
for our next album.

00:03.750 --> 00:05.333
He's like the greatest
music producer ever.

00:05.417 --> 00:06.542
So, are you saying
you want to work together?

00:06.625 --> 00:08.458
-I am.
-Awesome. I'll call the guys.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.500
-Oh, no, no, no, Nick, just you.
-What?

00:11.583 --> 00:14.709
I just read something online.
Jonas is breaking up.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.375
-Morning, Joe.
-Hey.

00:16.458 --> 00:18.458
I get a whole syllable today?

00:19.125 --> 00:20.375
I'm over it.

00:20.458 --> 00:22.542
-Wow, we really need to--
-Do something.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.834
Ever since we got to LA,
I've wanted to ask you something.

00:24.917 --> 00:25.875
What was that?

00:27.041 --> 00:28.667
Will you be my girlfriend?

00:38.375 --> 00:39.875
Stella, I'm going to ask you again,

00:39.959 --> 00:42.542
and I'll ask you a thousand times
until you say yes.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.208
-Will you be my girlfriend?
-Joe...

00:46.709 --> 00:48.792
-I want to say yes.
-Then say yes.

00:48.875 --> 00:50.792
But what's gonna be different this time?

00:50.875 --> 00:53.709
This time?
We broke up before we even dated.

00:53.875 --> 00:59.917
I know. I guess doing things backwards
is kind of our thing, huh?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.959
Uh, what's going on up there?

01:02.208 --> 01:04.125
You can rescue us later.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.458
Joe just asked Stella
to be his girlfriend.

01:06.709 --> 01:08.375
Please say yes,
so we can get off this boat.

01:08.458 --> 01:09.750
What? No!

01:10.709 --> 01:12.000
I thought you liked him now.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.166
Yeah, that was when I thought
this would never happen.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.291
-Say, no!
-Say, yes.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.834
Uh, if she says yes,
I will turn this boat around.

01:18.917 --> 01:19.834
No!

01:20.959 --> 01:22.125
Yes.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.166
-Yes?
-Yes.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.458
-Yes!
-Yes.

01:26.542 --> 01:29.250
-Guess she said yes.
-[Macy] Yay!

01:29.333 --> 01:32.166
-We both have boyfriends.
-[sing-songy] We have boyfriends.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.875
-They're so cute.
-The cutest.

01:33.959 --> 01:36.333
-And they're brothers.
-The brotherest.

01:36.417 --> 01:38.709
[giggles]

01:38.792 --> 01:42.041
Oh. Ooh, see ya!

01:49.834 --> 01:51.375
It's OK.
She'll be back.

-Uh, Mantra?
-I'm famished.

04:32.166 --> 04:34.667
I could eat everything on this menu

04:34.750 --> 04:37.917
except for this crusted speck of gravy.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.834
Mmm, I was wrong.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.750
All right, Mantra,
we really need to discuss

04:43.834 --> 04:45.709
the rumor you started about me going solo.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.375
Do you fancy quiche?

04:49.709 --> 04:51.208
More juice, band-wrecker?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.959
Janine, we've talked about this.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.709
OK? The band is not breaking up.

04:54.792 --> 04:57.041
And, yes, please.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.250
I want to believe you, Nick. I do.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.125
But nothing makes sense anymore.

05:01.208 --> 05:05.250
My whole world
is spinning out of control.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.333
Today's special is
cinnamon French toast.

05:09.417 --> 05:12.000
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

05:12.083 --> 05:15.125
Do you see why
we have to stop this rumor?

05:15.208 --> 05:16.917
I mean, it's all
the fans can talk about.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.250
In fact, we're doing
a radio interview tomorrow

05:19.333 --> 05:21.250
to prove that the band is still together.

05:21.333 --> 05:26.458
I dig your loyalty, your talent
and your watch. May I have it?

05:27.542 --> 05:29.667
-No!
-Saucy.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.000
A compromise then.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.166
Record one song with me.

05:35.000 --> 05:35.917
One song?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.083
I'm sure your brothers
will allow you that.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.709
-OK, I can make my own decisions.
-Perfect.

05:40.792 --> 05:44.166
We'll call it a side project.
I'll get you the best musicians.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.792
I'll push you in a whole new
artistic direction.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.959
I'll even allow you
to keep your little watch.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.959
-Does that sound interesting to you, Nick?
-Yeah!

05:52.041 --> 05:54.417
-Mace!
-I'm sorry.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.583
I'm just saying when he puts it like that,
it doesn't sound so bad.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.750
You protect me...

06:09.667 --> 06:11.375
from sorrow...

06:14.250 --> 06:16.083
and loneliness.

06:19.250 --> 06:25.208
I want to stay, but I'm a ghost,
and my time here has passed.

06:26.625 --> 06:31.333
-I can't let you go.
-Dade, we have to end...

06:32.542 --> 06:34.542
so we can begin again.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.000
No, come back!

06:52.875 --> 06:55.417
April!

06:57.583 --> 06:59.166
And cut!

07:00.500 --> 07:02.750
And that's a wrap on <i>Forever April.</i>

07:03.583 --> 07:05.291
Whoo!

07:06.208 --> 07:07.500
What are you doing?

07:07.583 --> 07:09.917
Oh, the movie's over, you know.
It's like graduation day

07:10.000 --> 07:11.750
-when you throw your cap.
-Pick it up.

07:11.834 --> 07:14.125
-Yeah.
-Come here, my little stars.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.333
-Oh.
-Yay.

07:16.417 --> 07:18.041
OK, hug over.

07:20.208 --> 07:23.792
Joe, I'm sorry it didn't work out
between us, but now that the movie's over,

07:23.875 --> 07:25.500
I would have been
breaking up with you anyway.

07:25.959 --> 07:27.583
It's probably just as well

07:27.667 --> 07:30.166
because Stella and I
have made it official.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.792
[laughs]
B.F.T.F.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.375
[chuckles]
L.O.L.

07:34.458 --> 07:37.333
-Laugh out loud?
-I thought it meant "lots of luck."

07:37.417 --> 07:39.875
You know what?
I am firing my youth consultant.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.375
Not that I need one.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.959
I am so happy for you two.

07:45.041 --> 07:48.875
We kind of have you to thank
in a weird way for bringing us together.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.417
Oh, no, don't make this about me.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.250
-OK.
-Unless you want to.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.208
-Do you want to?
-I'm good.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.333
Then <i>ciao.</i>
Mwah!

07:59.125 --> 08:01.458
OK, Blondie, why don't you go pack it up?

08:01.542 --> 08:03.000
-Oh, yeah, I'm on it, Mona.
-And, Romeo,

08:03.083 --> 08:05.125
you stick around
because I need to have a word with you.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.458
-Right.
-I'll see you later, Joe.

08:07.542 --> 08:10.041
-I miss you already.
-I miss you more.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.667
I miss you more than more.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.625
I miss you more than...
more-more.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.542
B.L.E.C.H.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.542
-What does that stand for?
-Blech!

08:19.625 --> 08:22.875
The two of you are making me sick.
Come here, I want to talk to you.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.250
So, listen...

08:25.333 --> 08:26.834
[doorbell rings]

08:27.625 --> 08:28.500
[Kevin]
I'll get it.

08:31.709 --> 08:34.750
-David Henrie.
-Kev-in.

08:36.625 --> 08:40.083
-You're hugging me.
-Yes, I am, buddy.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.333
Is this another one
of your lame tv shows?

08:42.417 --> 08:44.375
<i>David Henrie's</i>
<i>Awkward Celebrity Moments.</i>

08:44.458 --> 08:46.834
OK, look, I know I blamed you
for something Joe did,

08:46.917 --> 08:48.208
but all is forgiven.

08:48.291 --> 08:50.041
Wait, shouldn't I be
the one forgiving you?

08:50.125 --> 08:52.250
And I accept.
Here.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.250
It's a movie script.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.125
<i>Camp Ninja.</i>

08:58.792 --> 09:00.875
-Catchy.
-Very.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.750
Wow, Mace, so what do you think?

09:08.542 --> 09:10.667
I think Mantra really liked your watch.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.166
Seriously.
I don't know what to do.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.917
You're not breaking up the band.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.667
It's just a side project.
One song.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.166
Yeah, but is that what Kevin and Joe
are gonna think?

09:21.250 --> 09:23.709
I'm sure they'll be cool.
I mean, probably.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.709
Most likely. Maybe.
They should.

09:25.792 --> 09:28.667
-Unless they're not.
-Now that that's clear.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.000
All right.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.375
Bottom line,
what is your heart telling you?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.083
-I think I want to do it.
-Yeah?

09:37.166 --> 09:39.917
Nick, Nick, Nick!

09:40.000 --> 09:42.333
Look, Janine, I know you're a big fan
and I appreciate that,

09:42.417 --> 09:45.750
but I think it's time you found
something else in your life besides Jonas.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.208
Actually, Nick, you forgot your phone.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.208
Thank you.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.750
She put her number in.

09:53.917 --> 09:54.959
Huh.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.166
Not bad.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.208
Nerdy guy goes to summer camp
to train to be a ninja,

10:06.291 --> 10:08.000
falls in love with a samurai
from the girls' camp.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.875
It's a classic coming-of-age story.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.834
-With kicking.
-With kicking.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.875
I can see it on the poster now.

10:13.959 --> 10:17.917
-Totally.
-Kevin... [sighs]

10:18.000 --> 10:20.959
-I want you to direct.
-You better not be playing with me,

10:21.041 --> 10:22.959
because you know I take my directing
very seriously.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.792
Not at all! I saw the video
you did for the band. It was awesome!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.583
-Wow, thanks.
-No problem.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.834
You have a great sense of style,
you know how to tell a story

10:29.917 --> 10:31.667
and I know you'll work cheap.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.208
-Oh, is it low budget?
-Oh, not for me.

10:34.291 --> 10:37.208
I'm the star. But I promise
you'll make practically nothing.

10:37.291 --> 10:41.875
Oh, um...
It's a chance to do a movie, I'm in!

10:41.959 --> 10:44.625
You're in, excellent! I'm going to
announce it on the site right now.

10:44.709 --> 10:47.083
Actually, wait!
Uh, I should talk to the guys first.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.000
OK, sure. Yeah, cool.
Talk to the guys.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.500
I am pumped that you're involved.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.000
I can't believe
I hated you ten minutes ago.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.417
-Me neither! Bring it in, bro hug.
-All right.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.875
-[ripping]
-OK, wedgie. Why?

10:56.959 --> 10:59.583
Just the Henrie way
of saying welcome aboard.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.542
[exhales]
Oh, man.

11:04.834 --> 11:07.458
Whoa, so you're making
a sequel to <i>Forever April?</i>

11:07.542 --> 11:10.834
That's right, Joe.
<i>Forever April 2: Dawn of the Dade.</i>

11:10.917 --> 11:13.250
I'm in the title?
I mean, if I'm still in it.

11:13.333 --> 11:16.750
-Am I still in it?
-Sweetie, baby, dummy,

11:16.834 --> 11:18.291
of course you're still in it.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.917
Awesome.
Thanks, Mona.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.959
-We're shooting in New Zealand, too.
-New Zealand?

11:23.041 --> 11:25.625
-Mm-hmm.
-That's pretty far away.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.083
Well, April walks into the ocean,
what do you think,

11:27.166 --> 11:28.959
she washes up on the Jersey shore?

11:29.041 --> 11:30.834
Why not?
Lots of things wash up there.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.125
Well, <i>April</i> washes up in New Zealand.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.917
So, pack heavy because we're going to be
there for a very long time.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.709
[sighs] Listen, Mona,
I can't just pack up and leave.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.709
I've got the band, a new girlfriend.

11:42.792 --> 11:45.208
And a career as a movie star.
You're welcome.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.333
-See ya, Blondie.
-Oh, Mona,

11:48.417 --> 11:51.667
I just want to say I really appreciate
the opportunity to work on this film.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.375
You took a big risk on a kid from Jersey.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.333
Didn't I just say "See ya, Blondie?"

11:57.917 --> 11:59.667
Thanks again!

12:01.125 --> 12:02.834
-Hi.
-Hey.

12:02.917 --> 12:06.000
-So, what did Mona have to say?
-You know, typical Mona.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.625
Sweetie, baby, dummy.

12:09.959 --> 12:13.291
-That's it?
-Yeah, pretty much.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.250
[rooster crows]

12:26.333 --> 12:29.291
[man on radio] <i>Welcome back to</i>
Madman Marty in the Morning.

12:29.375 --> 12:30.667
[woman]
<i>Oh, Marty!</i>

12:30.750 --> 12:35.917
Yeah! It's 9:22 in the a.m.
Here on K-L-O-P, KLOP radio.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.250
Joining me in the studio
is my special guests,

12:38.333 --> 12:40.667
good personal friends of mine,
the band Jonas!

12:40.750 --> 12:42.667
Better known as Steve, Larry and Paul.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.709
-Actually it's Kevin.
-And I'm Joe.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.875
-That makes me Nick.
-Fabulosa!

12:47.959 --> 12:51.000
I guess we should talk about
the elephant that's in the room.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.667
[elephant trumpets]

12:52.750 --> 12:54.500
Not you, Dumbo.
I'm talking about the rumor.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.625
Is Jonas breaking up?
Yeppers or nopers?

12:57.709 --> 12:59.625
Actually, we're glad you asked, Marty.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.667
Um, we're here to tell everyone,
once and for all,

13:01.750 --> 13:03.291
that Jonas is not breaking up.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.208
[Joe] <i>Absolutely not.</i>

13:05.291 --> 13:07.542
-Never gonna happen.
-Oh, phewskis.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.000
I'm sure your fans
will be glad to hear that.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.542
Actually, we're gonna be
making a new record soon.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.458
Lots of new material.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.333
[Kevin] <i>Exciting stuff for all our fans.</i>

13:14.417 --> 13:15.834
That's me!

13:16.041 --> 13:18.000
-Uh... [clears throat]
-Keep your shirt on.

13:19.083 --> 13:22.000
OK, so Jonas not breaking up.

13:22.083 --> 13:25.959
But word on the street is, Nick,
you're doing a solo record with Mantra?

13:26.041 --> 13:28.291
-We just had breakfast.
-[buzzes]

13:28.375 --> 13:30.208
-It was really nothing.
-[buzzes]

13:30.291 --> 13:32.125
You would not believe how much quiche
that guy can put away.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.333
[buzzes]

13:34.417 --> 13:36.500
I don't know, Nick.
Something smells fishy.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.667
Nick, just tell him
you're not doing a record with Mantra.

13:38.750 --> 13:42.041
-Well...
-O.M.G, you are?

13:42.125 --> 13:44.291
-[bell rings]
-Nick, why didn't you tell us?

13:44.375 --> 13:47.959
-I was just waiting for the right time.
-Oh, this was perfect.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.291
-Did you know about this?
-Yes.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.959
-Mace!
-Sorry.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.542
[Marty] So, Kevin and Joe, are you two
just gonna sit on your hands

13:54.625 --> 13:56.917
while Nick and Mantra make
beautiful music together?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.166
["Wedding March" plays]

13:59.250 --> 14:02.000
I'm not sitting on anything.
I actually have a side project of my own.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.834
You're just saying you have a side project
because I have a side project.

14:04.917 --> 14:06.667
Oh, really? Well, tell David Henrie,

14:06.750 --> 14:08.750
because I'm actually
directing his next movie.

14:08.834 --> 14:09.792
What's going on here, guys?

14:09.875 --> 14:12.000
[Marty as pirate]
Arrr, there be storm a-brewin'.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.583
[normal voice]
You said it, crusty old pirate.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.875
-[thunder rumbles]
-[rain pattering]

14:17.583 --> 14:20.000
OK, I definitely did not
know about Kevin.

14:20.083 --> 14:23.875
When you think about it,
what do we know about Kevin?

14:23.959 --> 14:25.959
-You guys having fun yet?
-[whip cracks]

14:26.041 --> 14:28.083
Say, Joe, you've been
awful quiet down there.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.917
What's your big secret?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.875
-Secret?
-[Marty] Sure, secret.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.333
<i>You know, something you're hiding.</i>

14:34.000 --> 14:35.125
Secret?
I don't have a secret.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.000
Do I look like somebody who has a secret?
That's really funny.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.792
Why don't you play
the laughing guy, Marty?

14:38.875 --> 14:40.500
[baby crying]

14:40.583 --> 14:43.417
-What's he hiding?
-I'm sure it's nothing.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.792
-It sounds like something.
-We know you're hiding something, Joe.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.458
-No, I'm not.
-You can tell he is.

14:48.542 --> 14:51.291
-He's all sweaty and red.
-Yeah, like a big lying tomato.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.083
Ooh, that's a good one.
I'm stealing that one.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.417
[Kevin] <i>A big lying tomato.</i>
<i>A big lying tomato.</i>

14:56.500 --> 15:00.709
OK, it's <i>Madman Marty in the Morning</i>
here at 9:35 a.m.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.709
-Let's go to the phones.
-We didn't say we were taking calls.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.083
Line one, it's Stella!

15:05.166 --> 15:07.792
Stella, what do you have to say
to what's left of Jonas?

15:07.875 --> 15:10.333
Hi, Marty.
First-time caller, no-time listener.

15:10.417 --> 15:13.208
<i>-My question's for Joe.</i>
-We can talk later.

15:13.291 --> 15:15.625
[Stella] <i>Or we can talk now.</i>
<i>I vote now.</i>

15:16.291 --> 15:19.917
If you have something to say, just say it.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.917
Yeah, Joe, just say it.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.875
-Spill it, dude.
-OK, fine.

15:24.583 --> 15:27.583
Mona offered me the starring role
in the sequel to <i>Forever April.</i>

15:28.291 --> 15:29.792
And it's shooting in New Zealand.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.917
How long will you be gone?

15:36.667 --> 15:39.417
I don't know.
I guess... a long time.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.875
Stella!

15:45.125 --> 15:46.333
Stella, wait.

15:46.417 --> 15:47.417
-[dial tone]
-I'm sorry, OK?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.959
I didn't know how to tell you.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.000
Stella?
Stella!

15:52.375 --> 15:55.959
Well, it's 9:38 in the a.m.
Here with <i>Madman Marty in the Morning.</i>

15:56.083 --> 16:00.625
I'd like to thank my guests today:
the band formerly known as Jonas.

16:00.709 --> 16:04.583
And we'll be right back with
the latest castaway from Loser Island,

16:04.667 --> 16:06.250
keep it locked on KLOP.

16:07.041 --> 16:09.125
[exhales]
Really good interview, you guys.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.542
Seriously, really good energy.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.917
Yo, you think I could get,
like, a souvenir, or something?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.417
-Maybe like get me a guitar, or something?
-No.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.875
No? OK. Well, so...

16:18.000 --> 16:19.500
She's not picking up.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.458
If I was still talking to you,
I wouldn't pick up either.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.375
Well, it's official.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.417
Everyone on earth
thinks Jonas is breaking up.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.625
How could Joe not even mention to me
that Mona offered him the sequel?

16:37.709 --> 16:39.792
Stella, he probably
just didn't know how to tell you.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.667
Yeah, I mean, how long did it take Nick
to tell you about Mantra?

16:44.750 --> 16:47.750
Well, that's different. I mean,
we talked through it like we always do

16:47.834 --> 16:49.792
and then totally made
the decision together.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.625
And I am really not helping you.

16:52.709 --> 16:55.417
Joe and I had one good day together...
[groans]

16:55.500 --> 16:57.625
-One stinking day.
-Hey!

16:57.709 --> 16:59.583
Some people don't even get that.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.125
OK, I'm shutting up.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.291
It's the same old Joe.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.959
I should have known it was
too good to be true.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.583
[car honks]

17:08.667 --> 17:11.208
-The guys are here.
-I can't deal with him right now.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.792
-You two need to talk.
-Oh, Macy, just...

17:13.875 --> 17:15.834
tell him that I'm washing my hair.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.375
-Stella.
-Please?

17:17.458 --> 17:18.417
-Stella.
-Please?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.208
-OK, fine.
-Please.

17:20.291 --> 17:21.667
-Thank you.
-[groans]

17:24.208 --> 17:25.500
But you need to wash your hair for real

17:25.583 --> 17:26.750
because Nick and I
never lie to each other.

17:26.834 --> 17:28.000
I'm so sorry,
I'm making you feel worse.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.625
I'm just gonna go. I'll go.

17:32.417 --> 17:34.291
Great job, guys.
You were supposed to go on the radio

17:34.375 --> 17:37.750
-to stop the rumors.
-Yeah, nice job, Mr. Side Project.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.125
Why don't you direct yourself
to be quiet?

17:39.208 --> 17:41.250
-I need to talk to Stella.
-You can't.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.875
-Why not?
-Because she's washing her hair.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.750
-I've heard that one before.
-No, for real.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.667
-I'm not lying.
-She's not. I can tell when she is.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.000
-I wish we could tell when you were.
-Here's an idea:

17:50.083 --> 17:51.375
why don't you start a band
with David Henrie?

17:52.041 --> 17:53.333
How long is she gonna be
washing her hair?

17:53.417 --> 17:54.291
I...

17:54.375 --> 17:55.834
Not as long as
you'll be in New Zealand.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.125
-Back off, Kevin!
-No, you back off, Joe.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.500
-Why don't you both back off?
-Hey!

17:59.583 --> 18:01.125
[whistle blares]

18:01.208 --> 18:03.125
Wow, that whistle app really works.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.834
OK, here's the deal:
if you all keep on acting like this,

18:06.917 --> 18:09.291
the band will really break up.
Now is that what you want?

18:09.375 --> 18:10.750
-No.
-No way.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.875
-Not gonna happen.
-[Macy] OK.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.792
Then we need to fix this.
Band meeting, march.

18:21.750 --> 18:26.458
-Oh, you washed your hair again?
-Yeah, I had to.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.625
Because Macy can't lie to Nick.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.458
Never mind.
That's not even important.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.375
Are you OK Stella-bell?

18:34.166 --> 18:36.291
[sighs]

18:36.959 --> 18:41.291
-You were right, Aunt Lisa.
-Oh, honey. I told you.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.792
When you mix boiled vegetables
with whole grains

18:43.875 --> 18:45.583
you get a little gassy.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.291
No.
No, I meant about rock stars.

18:49.375 --> 18:52.667
-What did he do?
-Joe took a movie in New Zealand.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.959
-[sighs]
-And he didn't even tell me.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.792
-This is all my fault.
-Why?

18:57.917 --> 18:59.834
Because I should have told you

18:59.917 --> 19:02.458
there's only one thing worse
than dating a rock star.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.375
-What's that?
-Dating a movie star.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.959
OK, for every problem there's a solution.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.375
First the problem.
Nick?

19:18.583 --> 19:21.000
-We're all yelling at each other.
-OK, solution?

19:21.125 --> 19:23.291
-Stop yelling at each other!
-Good.

19:23.375 --> 19:24.834
OK, next problem.
Joe.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.625
-Everybody thinks the band's breaking up.
-Solution?

19:27.750 --> 19:31.041
We could play a gig for the fans,
so they could see we're staying together.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.625
A private Jonas show,
how cool would that be?

19:33.709 --> 19:35.125
OK, that's a really good idea, Joe.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.583
Well, it would put all the rumors to rest,
but we'd have to do it pretty quick.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.291
-Yeah, before things get worse.
-What about tonight?

19:41.375 --> 19:43.875
Tonight?
You think we could pull that off?

19:43.959 --> 19:46.166
There's only one way to find out.

19:46.583 --> 19:49.000
-Let's do it.
-Bring it in, guys.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.166
No matter where we go,
no matter what we do,

19:51.250 --> 19:52.500
the band comes first.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.583
[all]
The band comes first.

19:56.542 --> 19:59.125
-All right, well we don't have much time.
-I'm gonna check on Stella.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.000
Her hair's gotta be dry by now.
I know hair.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.917
And I will get the word out
to the local fans.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.917
Let's see, "Top secret Jonas show tonight.
Details to come."

20:12.000 --> 20:13.333
All right, we gotta find
a cool spot to play at.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.458
I got that.
I know a friend who knows a friend.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.709
-I'll make a phone call.
-[chimes]

20:17.792 --> 20:20.375
-Oh.
-[Kevin] Hey, man. Hey, so...

20:20.458 --> 20:21.875
-Oh, no.
-What?

20:22.667 --> 20:24.959
Hey, Mace, where's Stella?
She's not in the guest house.

20:25.041 --> 20:29.667
Um, yeah.
I just got a text. Joe...

20:31.041 --> 20:34.083
[sighs]
She's gone.

20:35.208 --> 20:38.458
-Gone where?
-Aunt Lisa's driving her to the airport.

20:40.542 --> 20:42.333
Stella's going home.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.125
[Kevin]
<i>Next on</i> Jonas LA...

20:58.208 --> 21:00.458
-Anything from Stella?
-No, she's not answering.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.709
-She's gone dark. She is off the grid.
-Macy, breathe.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.750
[Nick] <i>Aunt Lisa is just taking</i>
<i>Stella to the airport.</i>

21:05.834 --> 21:07.291
Listen to me,
if you get on that plane,

21:07.375 --> 21:09.208
you will lose any chance
