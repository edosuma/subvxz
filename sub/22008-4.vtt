WEBVTT

00:07.925 --> 00:10.292
Remarkable, isn't he?

00:10.469 --> 00:13.382
Perfect limbs, plenty of bone.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.841
Like God's own racehorse.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.977
Extraordinary.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.103
Tell me about the stud fees.

00:23.273 --> 00:28.485
A hundred and fifty thousand euros
a mare, 150 mares a year.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.229
A bit early to put him
out to stud if you ask me.

00:32.406 --> 00:37.368
Truth is, Fitz stands to make more
in the stables than on the racetrack.

00:37.704 --> 00:42.824
I know 150 K is a pretty penny,
but your mare won't find a better match.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.708
I agree.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.091
- To Fitzpleasure.
- To Fitz.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.176
Unfair, really.
Stallions get the prestige...

01:01.353 --> 01:05.643
...but breeding a quality racehorse
is as much about the dam...

01:06.149 --> 01:07.731
...as the sire.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.608
What have you done?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.337
You're a beautiful creature.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.883
Too beautiful for this world.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.925
It'll all be over soon.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.586
Hey, wanna grab lunch?

02:10.756 --> 02:13.999
There's a burger place in
Adams Morgan I want to try.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.001
- Lunch sounds so...
- The word you're looking for...

02:17.179 --> 02:19.387
- ...is "amazing."
- Completely amazing.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.422
But something parents would do.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.934
If either of us had
even remotely normal parents.

02:25.103 --> 02:29.268
That's the word I was looking for.
Lunch sounds so completely normal.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.276
- You know I love normal.
- Someone's trying to get ahold of you.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.061
- Sorry. Hello.
<i>- Pete called.</i>

02:35.238 --> 02:37.275
He ran the search
on the DNA from the bones.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.653
- Sorry. Not interested.
<i>- Not interested?</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:43.786
- Oh, right. Liz is there.
- You shouldn't call this early.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.493
- Telemarketer.
- They're not supposed call.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.081
- Pete wants to meet. His apartment, 2.
- We're on the no-call list.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.791
- What you're doing is illegal.
- She's right.

02:52.964 --> 02:56.082
I can't believe
I let the two of you rope me into it.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.595
At lunch, no calls.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.756
- No interruptions.
- Agreed.

03:02.933 --> 03:07.473
- Just you and me being normal.
- Yeah.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.306
Reddington.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.692
Nice upgrade from the no-tell motel.
Can you afford it?

03:14.861 --> 03:18.525
It's a three-day rental
Dembe found through some online site.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.691
Something B-N-B.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.827
- Are you familiar with such a thing?
- Me and a billion other people.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.409
They match hosts
who want to rent out their homes...

03:27.582 --> 03:31.246
...with guests who want to rent them
and get a commission from each one.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.582
It's a license to print money.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.338
The renters never
have to meet the owners.

03:36.508 --> 03:41.674
The Robinsons simply put my key in a
lockbox outside, completely anonymous.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.258
Peel.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.718
Great ideas are like great athletes:

03:49.521 --> 03:52.514
efficient, elegant, powerful.

03:52.691 --> 03:57.277
I'm aroused by both
and mourn the death of either.

03:57.696 --> 04:01.610
"Champion racehorse and trainer
die in stable fire."

04:01.783 --> 04:05.572
Fitzpleasure was the greatest
European racehorse in a generation.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.705
His stud price was set at
150,000 euros.

04:08.874 --> 04:13.494
But he only covered
a single mare before the fire, one.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.334
- Which is why I know he was murdered.
- Peel.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.920
It doesn't say anything here
about murder or arson.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.380
In horse breeding,
genes are everything.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.261
Fitzpleasure had the best.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.424
His owner stood to make
millions spreading his seed.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.637
Now he's dead...

04:28.810 --> 04:32.895
...and another owner is conveniently
positioned to reap the windfall.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.272
The owner of
Fitzpleasure's only offspring.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.149
- Bananas.
- What? No.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.653
"Pot, mustard, satchel..."

04:40.822 --> 04:43.735
- What's that? Q-I? "Qi"?
- Qi.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.821
- Come on.
- It means "life force."

04:45.994 --> 04:50.034
Honestly, you're like
one of those extraordinary children...

04:50.207 --> 04:52.950
...who knows how to
spell "onomatopoeia."

04:53.126 --> 04:57.621
Even he couldn't spell out why
a horse killer is on the Blacklist.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.500
The last white rhino,
the final dodo bird.

05:01.676 --> 05:06.262
The only surviving member of
a group or species is called an endling.

05:06.431 --> 05:11.392
You're not looking for a horse killer.
You're in search of "the Endling" himself.

05:11.561 --> 05:16.397
The nom de plume of a legendary
creator of one-of-a-kind items.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.810
Baghdad, 2015. An RPG
took down a private plane carrying...

05:20.987 --> 05:24.526
...one of two known statues
of the Sumerian goddess Inanna.

05:24.699 --> 05:30.036
Four crew members were killed, leaving
the only other statue in private hands.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.162
Turkey, 2016.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.995
A nursery cultivating
a unique species of...

05:35.168 --> 05:39.162
...drought-resistant barley was stolen,
three botanists were murdered.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.583
The profile to create the seed was taken
and all but one of the samples destroyed...

05:43.760 --> 05:46.468
...giving the new owner
a monopoly on the next harvest.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.130
Reddington believes
her next target is on U.S. soil.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.339
"Her"?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.634
According to Irish authorities...

05:52.811 --> 05:56.395
...the trainer who died in the fire,
had a visitor before the incident.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.684
A woman of Middle-Eastern descent,
early-30s, going by "Alicia Grey."

06:00.861 --> 06:04.229
Best way to find her is talking to
people who benefit from her actions.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.819
Fitzpleasure's sole offspring,
do we know the owner?

06:06.992 --> 06:08.904
Yep. Caleb Hess...

06:09.077 --> 06:14.163
...CEO of an international-security
contracting firm in Hanover, Maryland.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.416
Yes, I benefited from the tragedy.

06:17.586 --> 06:21.626
Your horse tripled in value overnight.
That's not a benefit. That's a windfall.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.007
Call it what you like. It's still a tragedy
I had nothing to do with.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.259
We reviewed
your financial statements.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.887
You have a bit of debt.
You can't pay your creditors.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.093
We're having issues, yes,
but I don't see...

06:32.267 --> 06:35.977
We know the woman that you hired
used the alias Alicia Grey.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.388
- What's her real name?
- I don't know. I didn't...

06:38.565 --> 06:41.558
You're the largest shareholder,
and when your stock nosedives...

06:41.735 --> 06:44.773
...so does your savings.
Now, that's a tough position to be in...

06:44.946 --> 06:47.313
...for someone who sees
themselves as a provider...

06:47.490 --> 06:49.482
...the person who
takes care of the family.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.901
That's how you see yourself, isn't it?

06:52.078 --> 06:55.788
That's why you transferred ownership
of your prized thoroughbred to your son...

06:55.957 --> 06:58.950
...just days after the unfortunate incident
with Fitzpleasure...

06:59.127 --> 07:01.619
...sent the value of
his new asset through the roof.

07:01.796 --> 07:06.211
You may be headed towards bankruptcy,
but your son is wealthier than ever.

07:06.384 --> 07:11.300
I transferred an asset to my child
for estate-tax reasons.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.965
- There's nothing illegal in that.
- No, there is not.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.555
But it is illegal to conspire
to murder a racehorse.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.721
And when we find out you did that,
which we will...

07:19.898 --> 07:25.735
...as well as your son benefitting from that,
we will go after him as a co-conspirator.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.442
- You leave my son out of this.
- Sure.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.982
Soon as you tell us
what we need to know.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.367
The woman, who is she?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.288
She never said anything
about murder.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.668
All she said was she could increase
my foal's value. She didn't say how.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.046
- How did you contact her?
- I didn't. She came to me.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.627
So how did you pay her?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.918
She didn't want money.
She wanted information.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.586
What kind of information?

07:51.763 --> 07:55.347
Security protocols we put in place
for the daughter of a king.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.305
<i>- Who is she?
- Princess Sonya of Montenegro.</i>

07:58.478 --> 08:01.266
My firm trained her team years ago.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.556
She'll have at least four bodyguards...

08:03.733 --> 08:06.146
<i>...working in coordination
with law enforcement.</i>

08:06.319 --> 08:09.778
<i>She uses alias, decoy vehicles...</i>

08:09.948 --> 08:12.816
...and books an entire floor
wherever she stays.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.760
- Dresner.
<i>- Where are we at?</i>

08:36.933 --> 08:39.515
Numbers are improving.
We hit our targets.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.520
Good. Prepare station three.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.022
I should have an addition soon.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.240
What does the Endling want
with European royalty?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.455
The princess is
the sole heir to the throne.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.496
- If she dies, the royal family dies.
- Who benefits from that?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.711
According to the State Department,
King Jovan and his daughter...

09:11.885 --> 09:15.253
...instituted reforms that were
unpopular with the country's hardliners.

09:15.430 --> 09:19.219
The princess' death means the end of the
king's line and a win for reactionaries.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.554
According to the
Diplomatic Security Service...

09:21.728 --> 09:25.221
...Princess Sonya is in D.C. to deliver
a speech at the UNESCO conference.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.481
She has a room block
at the Graylock Hotel...

09:27.650 --> 09:31.360
...in downtown D.C.
under the name Elise Wolf.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.773
Aram, alert hotel security. Ressler,
Navabi, Keen, get to that hotel now.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.033
"The work of all
the longstanding partners..."

09:47.670 --> 09:50.003
Perfect. Please, come in.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.460
- Ressler, FBI.
- Tom Campbell, head of security.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.422
We spoke on the phone.
Ms. Wolf has the entire 15th floor.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.008
- What's the fastest way?
- Main elevator. South hall.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.845
I'll keep an eye on surveillance.
I'm gonna need access to security feeds.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.315
End of the hall, suite 1550.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.777
- Wait a minute. What's going on?
- Donald Ressler, FBI.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.697
We need to see your princess.
There's been a threat.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.078
Checking the stairwell now.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.506
Wait, go back. That stairwell.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.139
Command? We lost power
on the 15th floor. What's going on?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.307
<i>There's been a breach on floor 15.</i>

10:51.943 --> 10:55.732
We lost the feeds.
We need to get her out of there right now.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.773
Back, back, back. Now.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.827
- Don't shoot. FBI.
- I need confirmation. What's going on?

11:44.996 --> 11:47.989
- FBI. Lower your weapons.
- What's going on?

11:48.166 --> 11:51.500
Princess Sonya, there's been a breach.
I need you to come with us.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.249
We got the princess.
We're on the move.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.806
- Ana Dewan?
- Yes.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.014
Diplomatic security. Please come
with me. The princess needs you.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.520
Please, it's urgent.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.021
- Are you all right?
- Wait. Ana.

12:16.194 --> 12:20.029
- It's okay. You're safe now. Please.
- No, Ana. We can't leave Ana.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.939
Hurry. Please hurry. Get in.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.573
I was able to pull a sample off
the bones and run a DNA sequence...

12:30.750 --> 12:33.242
...which is pretty remarkable
considering...

12:33.419 --> 12:34.830
- Did you get a name?
- No.

12:35.004 --> 12:38.122
- None of the databases had a match.
- Even the federal DNA database?

12:38.299 --> 12:41.508
CODIS is a two-step process.
I can't get past step one.

12:41.678 --> 12:46.343
I can run the search remotely which is
super-illegal, but that gets you a match.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.350
To get an identity,
you need a fed to authorize the request.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.306
You can know the bones
match someone...

12:51.479 --> 12:55.143
...but you can't get the name
without an FBI agent signing off.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.103
Which ain't gonna happen.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.357
- Whatever you're... Stop.
- I could take her credentials.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.489
- She doesn't have to know.
- That's a terrible idea.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.157
An ID would work.

13:12.583 --> 13:16.668
So I've started her on
Epogen, B12, testosterone.

13:16.838 --> 13:20.832
If she responds like the others, I'll have
her up to the desired volume soon.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.047
Alert your team.
I want them ready when I return.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.512
Hello there.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.059
Somebody knows we're here.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.936
Pity.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.937
I was just starting to feel at home.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.913
I need a name.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.578
The person who hired you.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.622
No one.

15:24.799 --> 15:25.835
We weren't hired.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.798
Proverbs 21, verse 10.
Solomon's dissertation on the wicked...

15:32.974 --> 15:35.387
...and the company they keep,
do you know it?

15:35.810 --> 15:36.846
Proverbs?

15:37.019 --> 15:41.229
Stirs up more passion than any
other verse we study in Talmud class.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.607
"There is no honor among thieves."

15:43.776 --> 15:46.769
I disagree.
A few thieves have been among...

15:46.946 --> 15:49.609
...the most honorable men
I have ever known.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.524
What about you, Sven?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.035
Are you an honorable man?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.658
Yeah, I think so.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.034
Let's put that to the test, shall we?

16:13.556 --> 16:15.548
I need a name.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.102
The Mailman. That's all I know.
Nash talked to him.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.978
The Mailman sent us.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.732
I do like a nice long soak, don't you?

16:34.577 --> 16:37.661
The Mailman.
Where can we find him?

16:38.414 --> 16:41.077
I know this is
a very difficult time for you.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.247
But understanding
why Ana was targeted is...

16:44.420 --> 16:46.537
...our best chance
of getting her back safely.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.501
Can you think of any reason...

16:48.674 --> 16:51.382
...why someone would target
your assistant instead of you?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.503
Ana isn't my assistant.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.638
She's...

16:56.807 --> 16:59.641
It's hard to describe what she is.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.268
I'm pregnant.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.396
My child will be
second in line to the throne.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.558
If something happens
while I'm pregnant...

17:07.734 --> 17:10.853
...if I need surgery,
Ana was here to provide the transfusion.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.067
Why not get one at a hospital?

17:14.116 --> 17:17.826
I have Lutheran B-negative blood.
It's a rare type.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.657
- There's no guarantee they would have it.
- But Ana does.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.290
That's why you keep her around?
She's a walking blood bank?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.578
Actually, Ana and I don't have
the same blood type.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.873
You're telling me seven people
in the world have Ana's blood type.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.962
Seven? Out of seven billion?

17:33.135 --> 17:36.674
Incredible, right? That is why
it is known as "golden blood."

17:36.889 --> 17:41.099
I understand it's rare, but not why
it's valuable to the princess.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.354
Okay, so 99 percent of us have
high-prevalence antigens in our blood.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.641
If the ones who don't receive
a transfusion from the ones who do...

17:48.818 --> 17:50.684
...the incompatibility can prove fatal.

17:50.861 --> 17:55.071
Finding a donor for people with rare
blood types like the princess is difficult.

17:55.241 --> 18:00.077
If they're in a crisis, I imagine it would
be a desperate race against the clock.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.488
Golden blood is compatible
with the princess.

18:02.665 --> 18:06.534
With any rare blood types.
It is the only known universal donor.

18:06.711 --> 18:11.581
Which obviously makes
its lifesaving capabilities enormous.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.249
With seven.
Imagine if the Endling kills all but one.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.885
Sole survivor's blood
would be worth a king's ransom.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.673
According to the database, two have
gone missing in the last three months.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.638
Does the database list
locations of any others?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.053
In this country, I see one.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.311
Ethan Isaacs.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.564
Currently in the ICU
at D.C. Mercy Hospital.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.272
Navabi, Ressler, get there.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.316
Next.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.114
Next.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.408
He's ready for you.

18:40.578 --> 18:44.447
My apologies. That last one
on the right, I've seen him somewhere.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.082
- So have I.
- Have you? And where was that?

18:47.543 --> 18:51.537
In my dreams.
I have a weakness for bad boys.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.668
I received two unexpected packages
at my residence last night.

18:57.845 --> 19:01.964
- Did you bring the packages with you?
- I'm afraid they're rather large.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.391
They said the Mailman sent them.

19:05.561 --> 19:10.181
Imagine my surprise when
I realized they meant an actual mailman.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.565
Yeah.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.521
I got no idea who they are.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.361
Let me refresh your memory.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.738
- They're the men you sent to kill me.
- Yeah.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.991
Sure thing, pops. Whatever you say.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.277
I got a nice roll of stamps for you.

19:23.454 --> 19:27.073
They have Calvin and Hobbes on them.
Why don't you take those?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.408
- You don't know who I am?
- Yeah.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.078
- You're a pain in my ass.
- But you sent them to my house.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.371
Why?

19:34.757 --> 19:37.215
Okay, is this a joke?

19:37.385 --> 19:42.176
That's... Yes, Janet from Circulation
sent you here to yank my chain, right?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.761
I think you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.803
Listen, pal. I don't know nothing
about you or your house guests.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.392
And the only person
I wanna kill is my podiatrist...

19:51.565 --> 19:53.898
...for having my orthotics
on backorder.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.900
Fifty-nine, ninety-eight.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.533
Alma, hey.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.868
Ethan was hoping he'd see you
before we take him home.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.874
- How's he doing?
- Kid's a fighter.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.409
But...

20:13.045 --> 20:16.209
...there's nothing more the doctors
can do but make him comfortable.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.627
I know. I heard.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.669
- He's always hated hospitals.
- I know, yeah.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.546
This way, he can
be in his room with us.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.135
That's right.

20:32.857 --> 20:37.568
So the nurses on four made me promise
that I would bring Ethan by before he left.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.525
So why don't you finish up here
and come down?

20:40.698 --> 20:42.530
They have cake.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.829
Hey, kiddo.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.253
Do you want to get out of here?
Yeah?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.009
Do you want to go home?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.296
Okay. Okay.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.634
Ressler, FBI.
We're looking for Ethan Isaacs.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.973
What does the FBI want with our son?

21:13.147 --> 21:15.639
We believe that
Ethan is being targeted for abduction.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.808
- There must be some mistake.
- Where is he?

21:17.985 --> 21:22.400
He's in his room with a nurse. Alma said
there was gonna be a goodbye party.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.990
Start lockdown procedure now. Go.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.901
Where are we, Alma?

21:28.078 --> 21:31.071
- Where is my mommy?
- Sweetheart, just get some rest.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.188
Hey, come on, what are you doing?

21:59.610 --> 22:02.819
When I was 17 and heading off
to the Naval Academy...

22:02.988 --> 22:06.948
...I sent the most extravagant
love letter to Sarah Ellen Winstead.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.278
She never replied.

22:08.452 --> 22:13.288
To this day, I remain convinced that
the post office failed to deliver it.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.996
And that if your colleagues
had simply done their jobs...

22:17.169 --> 22:19.707
...the entire arc of my life
might've been different.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.748
I might've been thinner
and living in Maine.

22:22.925 --> 22:26.418
You realize harassing
a federal employee is a felony, right?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.336
I'll add it to the list.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.591
Drive.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.194
Eight o'clock would be great.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.777
Oh, I'm sorry. Last name, Keen.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.443
- Thank you.
- You planning a hot date?

22:51.912 --> 22:52.993
Cascabel.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.871
- Oh, I love Cascabel's.
- I know.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.909
We're going for dinner tonight.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.293
You can't stay for lunch?

23:00.462 --> 23:04.376
I'm sorry. I got a call. It was Aram.
We had a break in the case.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.837
You don't have to explain.

23:07.261 --> 23:12.097
Look at those chickens,
and the burgers, and the fries.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.602
Root beer.

23:17.771 --> 23:21.765
I should be able to have lunch
with my husband like a normal person.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.310
You are not a normal person.
You don't have a normal job.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.524
That's okay. That's what I love about you.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.941
Well, you said you loved normal.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.735
Well, I did and I do.

23:33.913 --> 23:38.123
But normal, abnormal, deviant,
whatever you are, I love...

23:38.292 --> 23:40.454
...except hurt.

23:40.628 --> 23:44.121
Go save the day, catch the bad guy,
whatever you gotta do.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.290
Just don't get yourself shot.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.503
Okay.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.884
Hey, can I get one more of those?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.389
Cascabel's at 8.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.804
- You're buying.
- Hey.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.394
- Deviant.
- It's a big turn-on.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.979
After reviewing Ethan's medical file,
I found something interesting.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.739
Prior to 2011, it's blank.

24:11.909 --> 24:15.698
- How can that be? He's 9.
- Ethan wasn't always Ethan Isaacs.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.241
Exactly.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.828
The Isaacs adopted Ethan
in 2010 through an NGO...

24:21.001 --> 24:23.368
...that briefly brought
Syrian children to the U.S.

24:23.545 --> 24:27.380
Ethan Isaacs was born
Shahir Ahmad in 2008...

24:27.549 --> 24:31.042
...in Dar'aa, Syria to this woman.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.836
Nirah Ahmad.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.300
Ethan was taken by his mother.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.967
<i>Adoption records indicate that she has
the same rare blood type as her son.</i>

24:39.144 --> 24:41.682
And in a war-torn country like Syria...

24:41.855 --> 24:46.225
...she must've known a golden blood has
no chance of surviving a traumatic injury.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.644
If the mother's a golden blood,
she's at risk.

24:48.821 --> 24:52.064
- Why didn't she leave with her son?
- To fight for her country.

24:52.241 --> 24:56.360
She was a member of the Free Syrian
Army until she disappeared in 2014.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.655
- Right after Ethan got sick.
- Three months before her first attack.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.119
- How's locating?
- Ran her photo against images...

25:02.292 --> 25:04.875
...from the traffic cams
near the hospital.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.081
I found this.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.122
- Do we have an ID on the driver?
- Still working on that.

25:09.299 --> 25:13.259
According to his file, Ethan has
progressive idiopathic myocarditis.

25:13.429 --> 25:17.139
The procedure that could save his life
requires transfusions of golden blood...

25:17.307 --> 25:20.425
...the hospital couldn't provide.
Ethan was being sent home to die.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.218
Instead, his mother kidnapped him.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.308
After kidnapping
two other golden bloods.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.724
We've been wrong. She's not
kidnapping them to create an endling.

25:27.901 --> 25:31.144
She's doing it so they'll have enough
golden blood for the procedure.

25:31.321 --> 25:35.110
And it's not just the blood she'll need.
Myocarditis requires a heart transplant.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.946
For his body not to reject it...

25:37.119 --> 25:39.611
...the heart needs to come
from another golden blood.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.871
Pull everything DHS has on Ahmad.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.330
Phone records, passports,
known associates. Get into her life.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.995
Aram, widen the CCTV grid
to see if we can't get a hit on that car.

25:49.173 --> 25:53.133
I want this woman found before she
starts butchering people to save her son.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.925
Where are we?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.930
Some place safe, <i>habibi.</i>

26:00.100 --> 26:03.389
- I want my mommy.
- I'm right here, my darling.

26:03.562 --> 26:08.148
And when this is all over, I'll explain
everything to you, okay? I promise.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.776
All you need to know is
I did everything to protect you.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.947
I don't suppose you're gonna tell me
how you managed to get this.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.452
How long to ID the bones?

26:21.622 --> 26:25.707
You're all lathered up, you'd think we
were looking at the bones of bin Laden.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.868
Let me know
the minute you get something.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.661
I get it.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.764
I have enemies.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.770
People who wanna kill me.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.765
Why is not your concern.

26:50.943 --> 26:57.565
What matters is when it comes to my
security, I take extraordinary precautions.

26:57.741 --> 27:02.486
Tigger and Pooh violated
those precautions at your direction.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.655
I assumed it was to kill me.

27:04.998 --> 27:08.207
If it wasn't,
I need you to tell me why they did it.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.209
It wasn't to kill you.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.167
When people go away,
they put their mail on hold, right?

27:13.340 --> 27:14.706
We keep a list.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.752
It's a hold list of who's away
and how long they're gonna be away.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.592
And then, while they're gone,
we rob them.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.881
That's it.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.768
I know their correspondence,
what magazines they subscribe to.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.308
Based on that, maybe their area code.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.973
I can guesstimate the value
of the items in the house.

27:32.317 --> 27:35.276
- How extensive is the list?
- Covers the city...

27:35.445 --> 27:39.029
- ...and the surrounding suburbs.
- But it could cover more?

27:40.701 --> 27:42.192
- More?
- The hold list.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.903
Does every post office
in the country have them?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.616
Yeah, I suppose so.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.867
- And the robbers?
- I trawl the dark web for interested parties.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.420
Take my commission in advance,
then give out the address.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.502
What a marvelous idea.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.042
Really marvelous.

27:59.219 --> 28:03.179
Except when the owners rent out
their homes while they're away.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.886
But that's a small burl in the wood
we can sand down.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.267
Wait, so you don't live here?

28:08.437 --> 28:09.553
Excuse me.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.188
And what did you mean by "we"?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.144
Wait. Did he say "we"?

28:18.947 --> 28:21.439
The Endling's name is Nirah Ahmad.

28:21.617 --> 28:24.234
She has a sick child
who needs a heart transplant.

28:24.411 --> 28:28.826
My gut tells me every attack she's
responsible for has been to finance this.

28:28.999 --> 28:32.913
I know that people will die if we don't
find out where that surgery's taking place.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.668
What else do you know?

28:34.838 --> 28:37.751
Nothing. We have a photo. That's it.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.760
And we don't know
black-market medicine. You do.

28:42.304 --> 28:45.547
- I've seen him before.
- Do you know where to find him?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.431
No, but I know who might.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.676
Let me grab my hat.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.685
This should be fun.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.864
Good afternoon, young lady.
I'm here to pick up my labradoodle.

29:07.037 --> 29:10.246
What's the name? I don't think
we have any labradoodles in there.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.659
Her name is Edwina. She was dropped
off by my dog walker, Hiram Toomey.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.078
Of course. Edwina.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.381
I remember. Darling dog.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.507
Right this way.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.179
Thank you.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.146
Where are we? What is this place?

29:39.319 --> 29:42.778
The private clinic
of Dr. Melissa Lomay...

29:42.948 --> 29:47.158
...general surgeon and owner and
proprietor of Doctors Without Morals...

29:47.327 --> 29:51.241
...the first choice in healthcare
for the career criminal.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.910
Such nimble fingers.
Brings back memories.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.203
Raymond.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.080
How's your ass?

30:00.257 --> 30:02.715
Tight as a drum, thanks to you.

30:03.260 --> 30:08.005
We were camping in the altogether
under the most delightful autumn moon...

30:08.181 --> 30:12.425
...in the Forest of Dean
when a wild pig came out of nowhere...

30:12.602 --> 30:16.016
...and gored my left flank, so to speak.

30:16.189 --> 30:21.935
And Melissa here not only slew the beast
and salved my wound with a honey of...

30:22.112 --> 30:24.195
- Yarrow.
- Yarrow compress.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.027
But also made the most...

30:27.200 --> 30:30.238
...scrumptious pork pie
in the monarchy.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.371
- Fascinating story, but we're in a hurry.
- "We"?

30:33.540 --> 30:36.408
Cynthia Rutherford. I've hired
Mr. Reddington to find someone.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.951
One of your employees.

30:38.128 --> 30:41.041
Dr. Felix Dresner,
if I'm remembering correctly.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.002
- He's on a job.
- Where?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.839
You know I can't give out
that kind of information.

30:52.476 --> 30:56.561
Melissa, while I appreciate
your desire to protect the good doctor...

30:56.730 --> 30:58.312
...he is a liability.

30:58.482 --> 31:02.442
Ms. Rutherford isn't the only one
looking for him. The police are as well.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.854
Help me find him before they do,
and I'll cauterize the wound...

31:06.031 --> 31:08.148
...so nothing bleeds back to you.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.115
What has he done?

31:10.285 --> 31:12.072
The less you know, the better.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.828
We simply need a location.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.661
Okay, hold on.
I think I may have just figured this out.

31:17.834 --> 31:21.453
The street address you gave me was
zoned as a zoological research facility.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.963
<i>Construction was on hold
due to this court battle.</i>

31:24.132 --> 31:26.374
<i>However, if I'm reading
these permits right...</i>

31:26.551 --> 31:30.420
...the only section of the facility
that was okayed was the second story.

31:30.806 --> 31:34.015
<i>Agents Ressler and Navabi are
en route. Maybe 10 minutes out.</i>

31:45.487 --> 31:46.853
Step away from the tables.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.151
Hands, everyone.
Hands where I can see them.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.565
No, no. Keep going.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.286
I know you're trying to save your son.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.073
But I can't let you hurt these people
in order to do it.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.288
I will not let him die.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.038
- Gonna have to let us take him home.
- His home is with me.

32:05.215 --> 32:08.674
I gave him up once.
I will not give him up again.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.801
The hospital then.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.172
You know the hospital can't help.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.640
I know someone who can.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.602
What are you talking about?

32:22.774 --> 32:25.061
Is there a force
in the universe more powerful...

32:25.235 --> 32:27.773
...than a mother's love
for her child?

32:28.864 --> 32:33.029
The miracles of modern medicine
pale in comparison.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.951
It can be lifesaving.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.537
But not here.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.448
Not now.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.662
The next people
who come storming in here...

32:42.836 --> 32:45.795
...will be throwing you all
in paddy wagons.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.211
The best chance your son has...

32:49.634 --> 32:52.968
...is if we leave now.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.135
- "Leave"?
- Dresner can stay to care for the others.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.927
No, without the doctor,
or a viable heart, we can't...

33:00.103 --> 33:01.594
- I know.
- We can't.

33:01.771 --> 33:05.606
I'm asking the impossible,
for you to trust a complete stranger...

33:05.775 --> 33:07.858
...with the well-being of your son.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.692
But if you stay here,
the authorities will take him.

33:11.865 --> 33:13.481
And he will die.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.742
Please.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.411
Trust me.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.052
Three patients for emergency evac.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.267
- Keen, what's going on?
- Where's Nirah?

33:45.440 --> 33:46.976
She and her son escaped.

33:47.150 --> 33:50.439
I want birds in the air,
units at intersections in a two-mile radius.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.604
I want this woman found.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.410
- I need your services.
- No.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.829
It wasn't a request.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.846
- We're sorry for pulling you into this.
- No, you're not.

34:19.014 --> 34:22.759
Okay, no, I'm not
if it means saving Ethan's life.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.804
You're not sorry you're in this world.

34:25.981 --> 34:26.971
His world.

34:27.482 --> 34:31.271
The bypass machine is ready. Patient's
prepped. Soon as we have the heart...

34:31.444 --> 34:34.652
- ...we can proceed.
- The heart is already here.

34:37.449 --> 34:42.195
You know, the day that you were born,
I was also born.

34:43.248 --> 34:47.618
It was the day I discovered
the true meaning of my life...

34:47.793 --> 34:53.165
...was just to love
and protect you forever.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.840
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

34:59.681 --> 35:02.094
You cannot kill this woman
to save that boy.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.431
Agreed.
I have no intention of killing her.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.054
Strange.

35:08.231 --> 35:12.396
I always knew a golden blood
would have to die to save his life.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.688
But I just never imagined
it would be me.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.163
Clear.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.510
What's the end game?

36:27.018 --> 36:30.307
Nirah sacrifices herself to save her son,
and then what?

36:31.231 --> 36:33.314
There has to be an ulterior motive.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.725
Otherwise, why bother?

36:36.695 --> 36:40.530
I had no veiled intent
in giving you this case.

36:40.699 --> 36:46.866
Just a sincere desire to stop a criminal
I believed to be truly reprehensible.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.654
Now what do you believe?

36:49.249 --> 36:52.117
That a sinner can also be a saint.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.333
Are we still talking about Nirah?

36:57.048 --> 37:02.168
Given the same circumstances,
I'd like to think I'd be as brave as her.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.466
I know I'd want to be.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.308
- How is he?
- He's alive for now.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.438
His heart's beating on its own.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.601
An ambulance is on its way
to take him to a proper hospital.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.896
If he makes it through the night,
he has a chance.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.648
Thank God.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.701
- I'm in your debt.
- Can I collect on it now?

37:27.871 --> 37:29.988
- Name your price.
- Never call me again.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.373
- Either of you.
- Nik.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.579
You don't mean that.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.329
He's the country's
most-wanted criminal.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.589
He's my father.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.217
Which excuses nothing.

37:49.225 --> 37:53.390
An hour ago, Ethan Isaacs
was brought back to the hospital.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.930
But you already knew that, didn't you?

37:56.566 --> 37:57.556
Yes.

37:57.734 --> 38:01.102
You know Nirah Ahmad was
brought in for an autopsy to determine...

38:01.279 --> 38:04.192
...who shot her and transplanted
her heart into her son's body.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.948
- She shot herself.
- You lied to your partners.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.452
Told them you didn't know where
Nira and her son were when you knew.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.114
You conspired to arrange
an unauthorized operation.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.328
If I hadn't, Ethan would be dead.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.163
<i>And his mother would be alive.</i>

38:17.337 --> 38:19.624
<i>A criminal died to save
the life of a child.</i>

38:20.215 --> 38:21.877
<i>I'm okay with that.</i>

38:22.050 --> 38:25.293
Who cares if you're okay with it?
You don't decide who lives and dies.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.962
Neither does Reddington.
This was his idea, wasn't it?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.630
Yes, and I agreed with him.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.430
I know, and that's what concerns me.

38:33.603 --> 38:37.062
Not just now but going forward,
his influence over you.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.224
- I'm not influenced by him.
- Elizabeth.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.563
You know how much I care about you.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.195
As much as if you were
my own daughter.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.106
But you're not, you're his.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.868
And I would be lying if I said
that didn't make me concerned.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.284
- You have no reason to be concerned.
- Maybe.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.079
But if today was any indication...

38:57.252 --> 38:58.493
...I think I do.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.503
I'm watching you, Elizabeth.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.713
- Listen, man. I've been calling all day.
<i>- Blame your father-in-law.</i>

39:10.890 --> 39:13.098
He and Liz pulled me
into something insane.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.261
<i>- They what?</i>
- Don't worry. I didn't mention our secret.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.805
What about Pete? Because I've called
four times, and I've got crickets.

39:19.983 --> 39:23.226
- He'll call when he has something.
<i>- Don't like it. He's got the bones.</i>

39:23.403 --> 39:27.317
He's got the connection to CODIS. I could
see the dollar signs in his eyes earlier.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.528
- What if he screws us?
- Look, his place is on my way home.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.534
I'll swing by, see what's going on.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.493
Honestly, I don't know who's crazier:
you, or her, or me for helping both of you.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.703
Just call me the minute
you hear from him.

39:41.838 --> 39:45.923
I am the worst. I can't believe
I missed lunch and dinner.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.835
Don't worry about it.
It seems like you had a tough day.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.219
Yeah.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.132
It was complicated.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.138
Anthony, welcome back.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.855
Look, if this is about you
wanting a piece of my business...

40:05.028 --> 40:06.109
It's not.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.154
Okay, good.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.488
- It's about me taking over your business.
- No, that's not happening.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.494
Right now, you have
100 percent of a business...

40:15.663 --> 40:18.497
...that clears maybe 50?
A hundred thousand a year, maybe.

40:19.167 --> 40:24.003
I'm offering you 10 percent of a business
that will clear a hundred times that.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.541
How you gonna do that?

40:28.718 --> 40:30.710
The value of your information...

40:30.887 --> 40:33.595
...isn't in what you're able to
take out of these houses.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.257
It's in who you're able to put in them.

40:36.601 --> 40:40.936
Reliable safe houses are
incredibly hard to find...

40:41.105 --> 40:42.892
...and always at a premium.

40:43.066 --> 40:46.935
Instead of robbing these homes,
I propose we rent them...

40:47.111 --> 40:49.649
...to individuals
who don't wanna be found.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.439
If you can secure
hold lists in every state...

40:52.617 --> 40:57.737
...we'll have a network of reliable
hideouts stretching all across the country.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.075
Can you get the list?

40:59.248 --> 41:01.786
Yeah, I can do that.
You can get the people?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.498
Only the ones willing
to pay through the nose.

41:04.671 --> 41:05.787
So I...

41:05.964 --> 41:08.752
We are gonna be rich?

41:08.925 --> 41:10.086
Obscenely.

41:10.259 --> 41:14.094
In the meantime, what do you
have available for tomorrow night?

41:26.526 --> 41:27.562
Pete?

41:27.735 --> 41:30.227
I'm terrified to admit it.

41:30.405 --> 41:33.022
- I don't want to admit it, but it's true.
- No, it's not.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.695
Look, Liz, you're kind.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.700
And you're decent and honest.

41:37.870 --> 41:41.363
<i>Reddington is not decent.
He's dishonest and he's dangerous.</i>

41:41.541 --> 41:43.874
Reddington and I got Nik
involved in something...

41:44.043 --> 41:45.784
...he never should've been a part of.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.046
Nik's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.

41:49.215 --> 41:52.799
<i>I know he can, but ultimately,
it's my responsibility.</i>

41:52.969 --> 41:56.303
Nik would've never been involved
with Reddington if it weren't for me.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.223
<i>And he's been a good friend to us.</i>

42:01.602 --> 42:05.061
And I just feel like
we're never gonna see him again.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.766
And I don't blame him.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.610
<i>He'll come around.</i>

42:12.113 --> 42:14.070
<i>He will. Just give him some time.</i>

42:15.158 --> 42:16.194
He'll be fine.
