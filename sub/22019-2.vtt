CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

00:02.770 --> 00:06.228
IT'S KARMA.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

00:06.270 --> 00:07.362
HOW YOU FIGURE?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.492
THE UNIVERSE MEANT FOR US

00:08.540 --> 00:10.098
TO STOP AT THAT DINER
WE PASSED

00:10.140 --> 00:12.438
AND HAVE A BEER,
LET THE TIRES COOL DOWN.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.573
THIS FLAT COST US
A GOOD 10 MINUTES.

00:14.610 --> 00:15.804
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO HIT IT EXTRA HARD

00:15.840 --> 00:17.148
THE REST OF THE WAY.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.647
YOU EVER BEEN
TO A DOG RACE?

00:18.680 --> 00:20.113
NOPE.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.515
WELL, THE WAY THEY
GET THE DOGS TO RUN IS,

00:21.550 --> 00:23.245
THEY SEND OUT
THIS ELECTRIC RABBIT,

00:23.290 --> 00:25.144
RUSTY THE RABBIT.
IT'S HOOKED ON THE GUARDRAIL,

00:25.190 --> 00:26.714
IT ZIPS AROUND
IN FRONT OF THE DOGS.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.058
THIS ONE TIME I WENT,
THE LEAD DOG

00:29.090 --> 00:30.682
GOT OUT SO FAR AHEAD
OF THE OTHERS,

00:30.730 --> 00:33.119
IT ACTUALLY CAUGHT
THE DAMN THING.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.664
THE DOG
WAS ELECT ROCUTED.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.167
THAT'S A HORRIBLE STORY.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.633
AND THE POINT OF IT BEING,

00:39.670 --> 00:43.401
SOMETIMES SLOW AND STEADY
WINS THE RACE.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.805
YOU HEAR THAT?

00:44.840 --> 00:46.808
H EAR WHAT?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.808

KIND OF GILDED THE LILY
ON THAT LAST ONE, AGENT.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.528
I WANTED TO BE SURE.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.620
THAT THE BAD GUY WAS
SHREDDED LIKE TACO CHEESE?

01:43.670 --> 01:47.367
I'LL SEND THE RESULTS
OVER TO THE REVIEW BOARD
THIS EVENING.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.731
DID I DO OK?

01:48.770 --> 01:51.238

OF WYA'I'I' EARP.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.712

02:13.230 --> 02:15.289
IT'S OUR LAST SESSION.

TO SEE THIS DAY COME.

6 WEEKS OF MANDATED LEAVE.

FOR REINSTATEMENT.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.340
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
ON PROBATION.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.681
ADD TO THAT
THE LOSS OF A TEAM MEMBER.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.381
IT'S A LOT, I KNOW.
IT IS A LOT.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.854
BUT I'M FINE NOW.
WHEN DO YOU THINK

02:43.890 --> 02:45.824
THE BOARD WILL MAKE
THEIR DECISION?

02:45.860 --> 02:46.952
I FEEL LIKE WE'VE
DISCUSSED--

02:47.000 --> 02:48.592
THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE...

02:48.630 --> 02:49.597
LAST NIGHT.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.825
WHAT IS IT?

02:51.870 --> 02:54.759
DR. REID,
SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.906
WE HAD A REINSTATEMENT
HEARING VERY MUCH LIKE THIS ONE.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.931
LIKE YOU,
AN OUTSTANDING AGENT.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.904
LIKE YOU,
HAD BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.702
WE REINSTATED HIM.

03:04.750 --> 03:08.311
TWO MONTHS LATER,
HE OVERREACT ED
IN A HOSTAGE SITUATION

03:08.350 --> 03:10.409
AND NEARLY COST
3 PEOPLE THEIR LIVES.

03:10.450 --> 03:11.986
ALL THAT
IS A WAY OF SAYING

03:12.020 --> 03:13.954
THAT WE DIDN'T ARRIVE
AT THIS DECISION IN HASTE.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.958
THEY SAID NO?

03:15.990 --> 03:17.958
THEY SAID YES.

THEY SAID YES?

TALK ABOUT BINGE-WATCHING,

03:40.280 --> 03:41.417
SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT.

03:41.450 --> 03:42.587
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.315

PUT IN A SUITCASE

AND LEFI'

WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.

NO, SHE WAS IN ONE PIECE.

IN ANN BAKER'S APARTMENT.

SHE WAS GE'I'I'ING READY
FOR DINNER.

AND PANS WERE READY.

THE VICTIM'S BLOOD

05:36.870 --> 05:38.667
WAS FOUND
IN THE APARTMENT,

05:38.700 --> 05:40.930
SO THAT MEANS SHE WAS
PROBABLY KILLED THERE
AND THEN MOVED.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.835
IF THE UNSUB SIMPLY
WANTED HER DEAD,

05:42.870 --> 05:44.360
WHY NOT JUST LEAVE HER THERE?

05:44.410 --> 05:46.708
THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS
IT WASN'T THAT SIMPLE.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.901
IT'S NOT EASY TO FOLD
SOMEBODY UP LIKE A ROAD MAP.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.578

AND CO-WORKERS.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.173
WHAT ABOUT HER LOVE LIFE?

07:29.210 --> 07:31.906
THAT PLUS ONE MISSING
FROM THAT DINNER BOTHERS ME.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.646
IT SAYS HERE SHE WAS
SINGLE. NEVER MARRIED.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.170

07:36.220 --> 07:38.780

ALTHOUGH ANN DID HAVE

INCLUDING DATING APPS.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.656

NOT AT ANY RETAIL OUTLET

07:51.000 --> 07:53.491
HIT THE ROAD, JACK,
AND DON'T COME BACK.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.167
OR REVENGE, MAYBE,

IDENTIFIED AS LAURA WESTON.

08:05.980 --> 08:08.744
OK, ALVEZ, WHEN WE LAND, GO TO
THIS NEW BUS STOP CRIME SCENE.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.919

HAVE GOT TO BE WITNESSES

08:14.690 --> 08:16.658
MATT, TARA, YOU'LL
GO TO LAURA WESTON'S HOME.

08:16.690 --> 08:20.148

WILL SET UP AT THE LOCAL PD.

08:22.260 --> 08:27.937
C.O.D. ON LAURA WESTON
WAS ASPHYXIA, LIKE
THE OTHER VICTIMS.

08:27.970 --> 08:30.564
UNLIKE THE OTHERS,
SHE SUFFERED LACERATIONS

08:30.610 --> 08:34.569
TO HER ARMS AND HANDS.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.601
JJ: DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.572
BUT HE DIDN'T USE
A KNIFE TO KILL HER.

08:38.610 --> 08:41.579
MUST HAVE BEEN
TO INITIALLY CONTROL HER.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.611
I WANTED YOU
TO SEE THIS.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.548
DID THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS
HAVE LIPSTICK LIKE THAT?

08:50.590 --> 08:52.899
OUR JANE DOE WAS
TOO DECOMPOSED TO TELL.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.990
ANN BAKER, YES,
BUT NOT THIS EXAGGERATED.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.260
ANY EVIDENCE
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.598
NONE. WHICH SURPRISED ME.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.859
LAURA WAS WEARING THIS
AND ONLY THIS

09:03.910 --> 09:05.901
WHEN SHE WAS FOUND
AT THE BUS STOP.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.704
AND THERE WERE TRACES
OF NONOXYNOL-9

09:08.740 --> 09:09.775
ON HER FINGERTIPS.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.607
SPERMICIDE.

09:11.650 --> 09:15.108
CONDOMS ARE SOMETIMES
TREATED WITH NONOXYNOL-9.

09:15.150 --> 09:19.109
WELL, UNLESS THIS WAS UNDER
DURESS OR POSTMORTEM STAGING,

09:19.150 --> 09:22.153
IT LOOKS LIKE THE VICTIM WAS
PREPARING FOR CONSENSUAL SEX.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.283
YEAH. AND PROBABLY
WITH THE MAN

09:24.330 --> 09:26.958
WHO WAS
ABOUT TO MURDER HER.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.867
THEY'RE COMPARING DENTAL
RECORDS TO OUR JANE DOE.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.664
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET
AN I.D. SOON.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.667
YOU OK?

09:33.700 --> 09:35.065
MM-HMM.

09:36.940 --> 09:39.636
NO. ACTUALLY, NO.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.999
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.144
THERE WAS A CONDITION
TO MY REINSTATEMENT.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.978
FOR EVERY 100 DAYS
THAT I SPEND IN THE FIELD,

09:46.010 --> 09:48.069
I'M REQUIRED TO TAKE
30 DAYS OFF.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.917
I KNOW. THEY TOLD ME.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.111
SO IT'S NOT EVEN
A FULL REINSTATEMENT.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.015
OF COURSE IT IS.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.848
THE 30-DAY CLAUSE IS JUST
A TEMPORARY SAFETY VALVE.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.653
WE ALL NEED ONE
NOW AND THEN.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.055
HELL, I JUST FINISHED
WATCHING 119 EPISODES

10:02.100 --> 10:05.820
OF "THE AMAZING RACE"
FOR THAT REASON.

10:05.870 --> 10:08.293
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'LL BE PUT IN MOTHBALLS

10:08.340 --> 10:10.331
FOR THOSE 30 DAYS.
I'VE ARRANGED FOR YOU

10:10.370 --> 10:13.339
TO TEACH A SERIES OF SEMINARS
TO OTHER AGENTS.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.802
SEMINARS ABOUT WHAT?

10:14.840 --> 10:15.875
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

10:15.910 --> 10:18.845
THE WORLD ACCORDING
TO SPENCER REID.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.342
ARE YOU WORRIED?

10:22.380 --> 10:23.813
ABOUT WHAT?

10:23.850 --> 10:25.340
ABOUT ME BEING
IN THE FIELD,

10:25.390 --> 10:29.178
THAT I MIGHT FREAK OUT,
OVERREACT?

10:29.220 --> 10:31.051
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN--

10:31.090 --> 10:33.058
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO KILL SCRATCH.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.091
STANDING ROOM ONLY
ON THAT BUS.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.826
NO, I MEAN IT LITERALLY.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.191
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO YOU,

10:40.240 --> 10:43.801
IF I HAD FOUND HIM,
I WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

10:43.840 --> 10:48.777
AND...I WOULD HAVE
SLEPT WELL.

10:48.810 --> 10:50.368
THE REVIEW BOARD ASKED ME
TO WEIGH IN

10:50.410 --> 10:51.775
BEFORE THEY MADE
THEIR DECISION,

10:51.810 --> 10:55.371
AND I TOLD THEM
THAT YOU ARE ROCK SOLID.

10:55.420 --> 10:59.242
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT ON A LIMB
FOR ME.

10:59.290 --> 11:02.054
I KNOW YOU, SPENCER.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.729
THE LIMB ISN'T
GOING TO BREAK.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.399
LAURA WESTON'S PARENTS
ARE WAITING FOR ME
IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.771
ANYTHING FROM THE BUS STOP?

11:22.810 --> 11:24.846
ZERO. NO WITNESSES,
NO VIDEO.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.745
BUS LINE DIDN'T
GO ANYWHERE SPECIAL,

11:26.780 --> 11:30.181
SO EITHER THIS GUY
IS REALLY LUCKY
OR HE'S REALLY GOOD.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.155
THEY DID PULL SOME BLOOD
OFF THE HANDLE OF THE SUITCASE

11:33.190 --> 11:34.714
THAT MIGHT BELONG
TO THE UNSUB.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.409
SO MAYBE HE INJURED
HIMSELF THIS TIME?

11:36.460 --> 11:38.280
I'LL CALL LOCAL E.R.s,
CHECK TO SEE IF ANYBODY

11:38.330 --> 11:39.729
THAT FITS
THE UNSUB'S PROFILE

11:39.760 --> 11:40.852
MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
STITCHED UP LAST NIGHT.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.061
RIGHT.
GOOD. KEEP ME POSTED.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.319
THERE YOU GO.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.396
OH, CAREFUL. IT'S HOT.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.964
THAN KS.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.171
THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
THAT SOUND.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.404
WHAT SOUND?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.439
[CHANGE RATTLES]

11:58.480 --> 12:00.072
BARISTA MATING CALL.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.974
STOP BEING RIDICULOUS.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.146
HE WORKS HERE ALL WEEK

12:03.190 --> 12:05.181
AND THEN SHOWS UP
ON HIS ONE DAY OFF?

12:05.220 --> 12:08.348
IT'S NOT THE COFFEE
HE'S COMING IN FOR.
IT'S YOU.

12:08.390 --> 12:09.789
I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER HIM.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.923
HE TOLD ME A FAMILY
MEMBER DIED RECENTLY.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.928
SO?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.450
SO, I DON'T EXACTLY THINK
HIS MIND'S ON DATING.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.219
I SAID MATING,
NOT DATING.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.464
AND HE'S A GUY,
HELEN.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.162
THAT STUFF'S NEVER
OFF THEIR MINDS.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.509
FINE. BUT I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT

12:24.540 --> 12:26.428
WHEN ONE DAY HE LEAVES
AND YOU'RE SITTING HERE

12:26.470 --> 12:29.268
CRYING ABOUT WHAT
COULD HAVE BEEN. MM-MMM.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.408
SAME AS ANN'S APARTMENT.

12:39.450 --> 12:42.317
TABLE FOR TWO, WINE,
CANDLES, ALL OF IT.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.920
TARA CHECKED LAURA'S
LIPSTICK STASH
AT HER APARTMENT.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.520
SHE ONLY USED GLOSS
OR PALE TONES.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.166
SO HE BRINGS THE LIPSTICK WITH
HIM JUST LIKE THE SUITCASES,

12:51.200 --> 12:53.566
HEY, HOW'D IT GO
WITH LAURA'S PARENTS?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.465
WORST PART OF THE JOB.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.967
ALWAYS HAS BEEN,
ALWAYS WILL BE.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.103
THEY HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS?

12:59.140 --> 13:01.904
NO. THEY SAID THEIR DAUGHTER
WAS WARM AND GENEROUS,

13:01.940 --> 13:05.546
THE TYPE WHO ALWAYS
BEFRIENDED THE UNPOPULAR
KID IN SCHOOL.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.310
SHE NEVER SAW A STRAY DOG
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO ADOPT.

13:08.350 --> 13:11.012
SHE WAS WORKING
AS A YACHT BROKER
DOWN AT THE MARINA.

13:11.050 --> 13:13.257
SHE HAVE ANY MEN
IN HER LIFE?

13:13.290 --> 13:15.053
NOBODY SPECIAL.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.854
LIKE ANN BAKER,
SHE WAS USING DATING APPS.

13:17.890 --> 13:21.599
HER PARENTS DID SAY
THAT SHE HAD BEEN
DEPRESSED RECENTLY.

13:21.630 --> 13:25.066
HER BEST FRIEND DIED
IN A DROWNING ACCIDENT
IN CALIFORNIA.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.260
SHE WAS STRUGGLING
WITH IT.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.564
MATT: THESE ARE SEXUALIZED
ENVIRONMENTS,

13:28.600 --> 13:30.864
BUT NO SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.935
YOU THINK IMPOTENCE
IS FUELING HIS RAGE?

13:32.980 --> 13:36.006
EXCEPT THAT TYPICALLY
HAPPENS IN THE MOMENT.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.009
THIS UNSUB COMES TO THE SCENE
WITH A SUITCASE READY.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.415
IT IS PREMEDITATED.

13:40.450 --> 13:44.318
OK, SO BOTH VICTIMS
GRAVITATED TOWARD
THOSE IN NEED.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.409
LEWIS MENTIONED
TED BUNDY ON THE JET.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.281
I MEAN, WHAT IF IT'S
THAT, JUST WITH A TWIST?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.220
HOW DO YOU TWIST
WHAT'S ALREADY TWISTED?

13:50.260 --> 13:52.148
BUNDY'S RUSE WAS TO PRETEND
TO BE INJURED, RIGHT?

13:52.190 --> 13:54.454
HOBBLE AROUND ON CRUTCHES,
ASK WOMEN FOR HELP.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.626
YEAH, HE NEEDED THAT PROP.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.594
BUT WOULD-BE VICTIMS
ARE SAWIER TODAY.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.497
THE CRUTCH WOULD NEED
TO BE MORE SUBTLE.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.632
LIKE?

14:01.670 --> 14:03.206
SOMETHING INTERNAL.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.368
NOT A BROKEN BONE.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.833
MAYBE A BROKEN HEART.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.578
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT A REFILL.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.939
OH. THANK YOU.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.040
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

14:19.090 --> 14:21.888
OH, CUT IT BY ACCIDENT.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.889
SORT OF IN A FOG
THESE DAYS.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.659
I KNOW THE FEELING.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.521
TO LOSE SOMEBODY
CLOSE, I MEAN.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.528
MY DAD DIED
WHEN I WAS 9.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.663
I'M SORRY.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.464
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
YOU CAN TALK TO ABOUT IT?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.060
MY GRANDMOTHER,
BUT SHE'S SICK.

14:38.110 --> 14:42.479
I DON'T LIKE TO UPSET HER.

14:42.510 --> 14:43.477
[CUP CRASHES]

14:43.510 --> 14:44.602
WOMAN: ARE YOU OK?

14:44.650 --> 14:46.208
UH...SORRY.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.242
WOMAN: LET ME HELP YOU.
CAN I BUY YOU ANOTHER COFFEE?

14:49.280 --> 14:52.147
ROSSI: WE HAVEN'T MATCHED DENTAL
RECORDS ON OUR JANE DOE YET.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.488
WE'LL WIDEN THE SEARCH
100 MILES AT A TIME.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.318
HOPEFULLY SHE DIDN'T
GET HER CAVITIES
FILLED IN ALASKA.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.693
GUYS, BOTH VICTIMS
WERE WEARING A LIPSTICK
CALLED MIDNIGHT SURPRISE,

15:00.730 --> 15:03.028
WHICH CONTAINS RED DYE
NUMBER 2 AND AMARANTH,

15:03.070 --> 15:05.561
BUT HERE'S THE THING--
RED DYE NUMBER 2 WAS
FOUND TO BE CARCINOGENIC

15:05.600 --> 15:07.033
AND HAS BEEN BANNED
IN THE MANUFACTURING

15:07.070 --> 15:08.628
OF COSMETICS
SINCE THE 19805.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.103
MIDNIGHT SURPRISE.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.108
SO I GUESS LIP CANCER
QUALIFIES AS A SURPRISE.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.974
OLD SUITCASES
AND 30-YEAR-OLD LIPSTICK.

15:16.010 --> 15:18.240
THIS GUY'S FIXATED
ON THE PAST.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.612
OR A WOMAN
FROM THE PAST.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.049
SOMEONE WHO MAYBE
PACKED UP AND LEFT

15:22.080 --> 15:23.286
WHEN OUR UNSUB
WAS A CHILD.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.582
HIS MOTHER.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.247
IF OUR UNSUB WAS ABANDONED,
HIS CURRENT VICTIMS

15:26.290 --> 15:29.179
COULD BE SURROGATES
FOR THE FEMALE WHO LEFT HIM.

15:36.460 --> 15:40.237
[DISTANT SIREN]

16:01.090 --> 16:02.489
GRANDMA?

16:02.520 --> 16:04.522
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.687
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

16:06.730 --> 16:10.166
I'VE MET SOMEONE.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.499
HER NAME IS HELEN
AND SHE WORKS
AT THE COFFEE SHOP WITH ME.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.328
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER
BEFORE, REMEMBER?

16:17.370 --> 16:20.703
SHE'S NOT LIKE THE OTHERS,
GRANDMA, HONEST.

16:20.740 --> 16:24.244
SHE TOLD ME TODAY
SHE LOST HER DAD
WHEN SHE WAS 9,

16:24.280 --> 16:26.578
ALMOST LIKE ME
WITH MY MOM.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.182
HER FATHER DIED.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.212
YOUR MOTHER LEFT.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.310
BUT HELEN UNDERSTANDS.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.419
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT,
A WHORE,

16:38.460 --> 16:40.189
JUST LIKE ALL THE REST?

16:40.230 --> 16:41.197
DON'T CALL HER THAT.

16:41.230 --> 16:44.097
THAT'S WHAT SHE IS,
A WHORE.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.189
AND SHE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU.
SHE'S GONNA GO.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.334
SHE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

16:48.370 --> 16:50.133
NO!

16:52.510 --> 16:55.331
NO!

16:58.550 --> 17:01.417
NO. NO, NO, DON'T LEAVE!

17:01.450 --> 17:03.111
COME BACK!

17:03.150 --> 17:03.639
NO!

17:08.320 --> 17:09.218
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND
AN OVERLAP

17:09.260 --> 17:10.284
WITH THESE VICTIMS.

17:10.330 --> 17:13.254
ONE'S A NURSE,
ONE SELLS BOATS,

17:13.300 --> 17:15.291
HOW ARE THEY INTERSECTING
WITH THE UNSUB?

17:17.130 --> 17:19.189
DEATH, MAYBE?

17:19.230 --> 17:20.390
ANN BAKER, SHE VOLUNTEERED

17:20.440 --> 17:22.567
AT A PALLIATIVE
CARE FACILITY, RIGHT?

17:22.600 --> 17:25.364
AND LAURA HAD A FRIEND
WHO JUST RECENTLY DIED.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.139
BY DROWNING,
IN CALIFORNIA.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.308
BUT PRENTISS SAID THAT LAURA
WAS STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.669
SO WHAT IF SHE SOUGHT
OUT HELP--

17:31.710 --> 17:33.268
COUNSELING
OR A SUPPORT GROUP?

17:33.320 --> 17:36.448
A TED BUNDY
FOR THE EMO GENERATION.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.141
GRIEF AND LOSS ARE THE BAIT,

17:38.190 --> 17:41.717
AND THAT'S HOW HE DRAWS
HIS VICTIMS INTO HIS ORBIT.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.635
I'M SORRY.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.553
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT HELEN.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.488
PRENTISS: WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MALE IN HIS EARLY
TO MID-20$.

18:58.530 --> 19:00.760
HE'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO STRANGLE HIS VICTIMS,

19:00.800 --> 19:02.791
STUFF THEM INTO
OVERSIZE LUGGAGE,

19:02.840 --> 19:05.866
AND THEN TRANSPORT THE BODIES
TO SECONDARY DISPOSAL SITES.

19:05.910 --> 19:08.731
HE'S MOSTLY LIKELY HANDSOME
AND NON-THREATENING.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.943
HE'S ABLE TO INSINUATE
HIMSELF INTO HIS VICTIMS'
LIVES ROMANTICALLY

19:11.980 --> 19:13.311
BEFORE MURDERING THEM.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.511
BUT THIS PERSON DIFFERS
FROM THE USUAL

19:15.550 --> 19:19.441
CHARM-AND-HARM KILLER
IN THAT HE DOES NOT
ACTIVELY SEDUCE HIS VICTIMS.

19:19.490 --> 19:20.684
RATHER, THEY COME
TO HIM.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.779
HE HUNTS BY MAKING
HIMSELF THE HUNTED.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.526
IN PSYCHOANALYSIS,
THIS IS KNOWN

19:24.560 --> 19:26.551
AS THE FLORENCE
NIGHTINGALE EFFECT,

19:26.590 --> 19:28.956
A TERM GIVEN TO CAREGIVERS
WHO DEVELOP STRONG SEXUAL

19:29.000 --> 19:30.729
OR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS
WITH THEIR PATIENTS.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.795
WE BELIEVE THE STRESSOR
HAS BEEN IN PLACE
SINCE CHILDHOOD

19:32.830 --> 19:34.832
AND INVOLVES ABANDONMENT
BY A MATERNAL FIGURE,

19:34.870 --> 19:36.690
MOST LIKELY HIS ACTUAL MOTHER.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.459
JJ: BUT THIS GOES FAR BEYOND
THE MERE SEEKING OUT

19:39.510 --> 19:40.829
OF LOST MOTHERLY LOVE.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.246
FOR SOME REASON,
HIS NEED IS ENTANGLED

19:43.280 --> 19:46.408
WITH INTENSE AND RITUALISTIC
HOMICIDAL IMPULSES.

19:46.450 --> 19:49.419
ALVEZ: SOMETHING OR SOMEONE
ELSE COULD BE IN PLAY.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.315
UP UNTIL NOW,
HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO EASILY

19:51.350 --> 19:52.715
COM PARTM ENTALIZE
HIS LIFE,

19:52.750 --> 19:54.684
SEPARATING
THE PSYCHOPATH WHO KILLS

19:54.720 --> 19:57.655
FROM THE PART OF HIM
WHO EASILY BLENDS INTO
NORMAL SOCIETY.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.454
LEWIS: HOWEVER, SOMETHING
RECENTLY TRIGGERED
A BREAKDOWN

20:00.500 --> 20:02.491
IN THESE WALLS,
AND HIS ABILITY TO SEPARATE

20:02.530 --> 20:04.998
THE SANE FROM THE PSYCHOPATH
IS RAPIDLY ERODING.

20:05.030 --> 20:08.295
WE THEREFORE EXPECT
THIS KILLER WILL BECOME
MORE RECKLESS

20:08.340 --> 20:12.367
AND MORE VIOLENT.
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.441
GRANDMA'S VOICE:
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.280
[STARTS ENGINE]

20:25.320 --> 20:29.950
GRANDMA: SHE'S A WHORE,
LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.909
FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.033
WHY DOES THAT TYPE OF WOMAN
FLIP HIS SWITCH?

20:48.080 --> 20:52.449
I COULD MAKE A JOKE
ABOUT UNIFORMS
AND SPONGE BATHS.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.641
BUT THAT WOULD BE
BENEATH ME. I...

20:58.690 --> 21:01.682
NO WITNESSES,
GEO PROFILE'S BEEN A DEAD END.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.426
WE CAN AT LEAST
NARROW DOWN THE TIMEFRAME.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.382
DID THE M.E. HAVE
AN ESTIMATE ON WHEN
JANE DOE WAS KILLED?

21:05.430 --> 21:07.057
BALLPARK,
MONTH AND A HALF AGO.

21:07.090 --> 21:09.854
SO THE END OF AUGUST,
ROUGHLY.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.390
PRENTISS: GARCIA?

21:11.430 --> 21:13.864
WELCOME TO THE REQUEST LINE
AT NOON WITH PENNY.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.367
WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.936
I NEED YOU TO CHECK
AND SEE IF ANYTHING UNUSUAL

21:16.970 --> 21:19.609
HAPPENED IN THE NAPLES
AREA DURING THE LAST
TWO WEEKS OF AUGUST.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.972
UNUSUAL. CAN YOU
NARROW THAT DOWN A SKOSH?

21:22.010 --> 21:23.375
NOT YET, UNFORTUNATELY.

21:23.410 --> 21:24.946
THEN I WILL SEEK OUT
UNUSUAL.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.675
GARCIA, DID YOU LOOK
FOR ANY OVERLAP

21:26.710 --> 21:28.041
BETWEEN LAURA'S
SUPPORT GROUP

21:28.080 --> 21:30.548

ROSSI: HE MAY NOT HAVE
BEEN PART OF HER GROUP,

31:41.100 --> 31:43.227
BUT THEY COULD'VE EASILY
CROSSED PATHS THERE.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.296
SIMMONS: SO EDITH WAS
PROBABLY THE ONLY THING

31:45.330 --> 31:47.469
THAT KEPT A LID ON BILLY'S
DESTRUCT IVE BEHAVIOR.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.559
THEN SHE DIES,
AND THESE MURDERS START.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.103

WORK AND HOME ADDRESS NOW.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.005
PRENTISS: MATT, YOU AND LEWIS
GO TO HIS WORKPLACE.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.531
WE'LL SEND JJ AND ALVEZ
TO CHECK OUT HIS APARTMENT.

32:08.990 --> 32:11.220
WE HAD AN
ARGUMENT EARLIER.

32:11.260 --> 32:14.491
SHE'S PROBABLY ANGRY
AND WENT OUT FOR A WHILE.

32:18.400 --> 32:22.097
MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF
I MEET HER ANOTHER TIME.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.563
WELL, PRETTY SURE SHE'LL
BE BACK ANY SECOND.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.965
NO. REALLY,
I SHOULD GO.

32:27.010 --> 32:28.671
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

32:28.710 --> 32:32.976
WILL YOU TAKE ME
HOME, PLEASE?

32:33.010 --> 32:35.149
NO.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.648
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
MY GRANDMOTHER MEET YOU.

FOR A WILLIAM LYNCH.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.417
WE UNDERSTAND
HE WORKS HERE.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.611
BILLY? HE QUIT
THIS MORNING.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.016
YOU JUST MISSED HIM,
ACTUALLY.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.482
SOMETHING WRONG?

33:17.520 --> 33:18.726
HOW LONG AGO
WAS HE HERE?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.523
ABOUT AN HOUR.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.652
HE CAME BY
TO PICK UP HELEN,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.588
ONE OF OUR WORKERS.

33:23.630 --> 33:27.066
I THINK THEY WERE
GOING ON A DATE.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.570
OH, THERE'S GOT TO BE
A STORY BEHIND THAT SCOWL.

33:35.610 --> 33:38.078
RUTH LYNCH, BILLY'S
MISSING MOTHER.

33:38.110 --> 33:39.543
THE ONE WHO BAILED
20 YEARS AGO.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.478
HERE'S THE THING.

33:40.510 --> 33:41.738
THE MORE YOU LOOK INTO
IT, THE LESS SHE SEEMS

33:41.780 --> 33:43.611
LIKE THE TYPE
TO ABANDON HER CHILD.

33:43.650 --> 33:45.117
I THOUGHT SHE HAD
DRUG ISSUES.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.447
SHE DID, BUT SHE'D
BEEN GOING TO REHAB,

33:46.490 --> 33:48.048
AND ON PAPER, SHE
WAS A GOOD MOTHER,

33:48.090 --> 33:49.409
RESPONSIBLE.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.451
SHE KEPT HER CHILD'S
VACCINATIONS UP TO DATE.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.048
SHE EVEN SPENT WHAT
LITTLE EXTRA MONEY

33:53.090 --> 33:54.751
SHE HAD TO SEND BILLY
TO SUMMER CAMP.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.291
WAS A MISSING PERSONS
REPORT FILED AT THE TIME?

33:57.330 --> 33:59.560
YES, FILED BY A FRIEND
NAMED SUSAN ALDRETE.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.534
DO WE KNOW WHERE THIS
SUSAN ALDRETE IS NOW?

34:01.570 --> 34:02.730
SHE'S IN FORT MYERS.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.237
I JUST CALLED HER, BUT
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

34:04.270 --> 34:06.135
WELL, THAT'S NOT
TOO LONG A DRIVE.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.377
WHY DON'T I GO UP
THERE AND GIVE IT

34:08.410 --> 34:10.298
A TRY MYSELF?

34:10.340 --> 34:12.069
I'VE GOT A FACE THAT
MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN

34:12.110 --> 34:14.112
CAN'T SAY NO TO.

SAID THERE'S ALSO

34:20.490 --> 34:21.718

34:21.760 --> 34:22.852
AFTER SHE DIED,
THE CITY SAID

34:22.890 --> 34:24.118
IT WASN'T UP TO CODE,

LIVING THERE.

CHECK IT OUT?

SAID SHE WOULD.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.104

I JUST HAD A TALK
WITH SUSAN ALDRETE.

35:40.330 --> 35:41.763
APPARENTLY, SHE AND RUTH
PLANNED TO SHARE

35:41.800 --> 35:43.631

IN FORT MYERS

35:43.670 --> 35:44.864
WHEN RUTH DISAPPEARED.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.434
WHAT HAPPENED? DID
RUTH GET COLD FEET?

35:46.470 --> 35:47.732
I DON'T THINK SO.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.533

SOME OF HER STUFF

AHEAD OF TIME.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.545

MOSTLY CLOTHES,

35:53.580 --> 35:57.209
BUT RUTH SENT
SOMETHING ELSE.
