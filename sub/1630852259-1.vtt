that I might be missing something.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.530
So, I hooked up
with some modern-day explorers

00:30.947 --> 00:34.784

to the ends of the Earth.

00:35.785 --> 00:39.706

"Oh, we can go further than that."

any climbing whatsoever.

01:09.986 --> 01:13.656

this secret fantasy

There's nothing. There's nothing.

33:59.245 --> 34:01.664
I think that's the first time in my life
I've ever heard...

34:01.831 --> 34:03.124
-MICHEL: Nothing.
-Nothing.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.375
MICHEL: Naturally nothing.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.585
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.420
-Wow!
-Yeah, nice and pretty amazing.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.714
-It's heavy.
-MICHEL: It's heavy, yeah, totally.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.716
It's like... It's a...
It's a heavy sensation.

34:11.799 --> 34:15.845
Yeah. So,
this instrument what they will do...

34:17.096 --> 34:20.099
is to record whatever we cannot hear now.

34:39.368 --> 34:42.455
WILL:<i> If you want to hear</i>

34:43.414 --> 34:47.460
<i>quieter than your breathing,</i>
<i>quieter than your heart beating,</i>

34:48.878 --> 34:51.130
<i>then you either have to stop those things</i>

34:51.714 --> 34:54.509
<i>or get the hell out of the way.</i>

34:57.095 --> 35:00.556

35:03.351 --> 35:07.271

WILL:
<i>Sounds from deep within the mountains.</i>

35:38.261 --> 35:40.429
<i>It's actually thought to be the sound</i>

35:40.638 --> 35:44.976

<i>dragging the mountains.</i>

35:45.768 --> 35:50.064
(LOUD RUMBLING)

35:58.906 --> 36:02.952
The moon pulls on the sea to create tides.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.956
<i>It turns out,</i>
<i>it does the same to the land.</i>

36:08.374 --> 36:10.793
<i>And it's not just the mountains</i>
<i>that are moving.</i>

36:14.422 --> 36:19.302

36:34.358 --> 36:36.402
(RUMBLING)

36:40.406 --> 36:43.159
WILL: <i>Because the moon moves cities too.</i>

<i>New York rises and falls up to 14 inches</i>

36:51.083 --> 36:53.711
<i>twice a day, every day.</i>

36:56.214 --> 36:59.967

37:53.396 --> 37:56.357
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

38:02.363 --> 38:05.741
I was tuned into a...
a whole world of sound

38:06.075 --> 38:09.704
that even as a musician
had been hidden from me.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.584
ERIK: <i>I feel pretty proud</i>
<i>that I was able to give Will</i>

38:15.668 --> 38:18.212
<i>a little glimpse into my experience.</i>

38:18.879 --> 38:22.550
<i>To not just be wowed</i>
<i>by all the visual things in the world,</i>

38:22.675 --> 38:26.929
<i>but to actually be able to hear subtleties</i>
<i>and beautiful things and violent things.</i>

38:27.722 --> 38:30.099
Sight is just a sliver of reality.

38:30.516 --> 38:31.892
And so, in a way,

38:32.143 --> 38:36.605
maybe I'm helping him to really experience
the full spectrum of living.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.074

39:11.724 --> 39:13.726
<i>with the sounds of the volcano,</i>

39:14.352 --> 39:17.772

<i>with the primal forces of nature.</i>

39:18.105 --> 39:19.440
Whoo!

39:19.648 --> 39:22.485
So, all of these dances and everything
are about the volcano?

39:22.985 --> 39:28.407
Yes. Exactly how the... the lava
is melting inside, like, boiling...

39:28.657 --> 39:31.452
So that's why...
Sometimes you can hear it like this.
