00:01.166 --> 00:02.875
[Emma]  Previously on
The Lying Game...

00:02.875 --> 00:04.417
-Laurel?
-Nothing happened.

00:04.417 --> 00:07.417
Nothing happened?
I just... I just find that
so hard to believe.

00:07.417 --> 00:09.583
He said that I was
worth waiting for.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.084
You actually
bought that in there?

00:11.084 --> 00:13.084
[Laurel]  There was no waitin
at the Squatter Inn.

00:13.084 --> 00:14.542
Let's just say,
been there, done that.

00:14.542 --> 00:17.166
Social services said I'm
supposed to call the cops.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.667
That's just what
I think I'm gonna do.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.000
What are we waiting for?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.208
I think...

00:21.208 --> 00:22.208
We should...

00:23.625 --> 00:25.000
You know.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.625
I think you've had
too much to drink.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.458
All right. I'm gonna
put you to bed.

00:28.458 --> 00:30.125
No, I'm gonna put you to bed.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.542
[Sutton]  "Hey, Mom and Dad.

00:31.542 --> 00:33.708
"You should know that the girl
living in my room right now

00:33.708 --> 00:36.000
"and calling herself
Sutton isn't me."

00:37.625 --> 00:40.708
Yo, Emma! Thought everybody
got one call from juvie.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.834
And you don't use yours
to call your best friend?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.625
[Lexi]  You can just tell me
everything while we drive.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.834
[upbeat music]

00:55.417 --> 00:58.583
So, Emma, aside from
the fact that you disappeared

00:58.583 --> 01:01.291
and scared the crap out of me,
how was Phoenix?

01:01.291 --> 01:02.667
I got to know.

01:02.667 --> 01:06.041
Oh. Phoenix...
Was fine.

01:06.041 --> 01:09.417
You sound like
you're describing
a trip to Applebee's.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.084
Dude, you found
your long-lost twin.

01:12.084 --> 01:13.458
This is huge.

01:13.458 --> 01:14.959
Like, what was she like?

01:14.959 --> 01:16.000
Is she cool or is she snobby?

01:16.708 --> 01:17.834
Actually, she's--

01:17.834 --> 01:19.125
Oh, what about your birth mom?

01:19.125 --> 01:21.125
-Did y'all find her?
-Wow!

01:22.208 --> 01:24.667
I really just told you
everything, didn't I?

01:24.667 --> 01:29.375
Lexi, you ever notice what
a big stupid mouth I have?

01:29.375 --> 01:30.917
Frequently.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.417
Oh, and speaking of
big stupid mouths,

01:32.417 --> 01:34.375
Clarice knows you're here.

01:34.375 --> 01:36.750
The cops must have
called her whenever
you were booked.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.625
"Clarice"?

01:40.209 --> 01:41.083
Oh...

01:42.209 --> 01:44.417
That evil foster mother.

01:44.417 --> 01:46.417
Hey, you don't think
she's the one

01:46.417 --> 01:48.750
that signed
for my release, do you?

01:48.750 --> 01:50.166
Extremely doubtful.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.208
She was kind of hoping
you would rot in there.

01:53.041 --> 01:54.375
So, how long you in Vegas for?

01:54.375 --> 01:55.583
I'm not really sure.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.750
I need to get back
to California.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.708
That's where...

01:58.708 --> 02:01.917
Sutton found our mom.

02:01.917 --> 02:04.875
Unfortunately, I don't
have any cash or clothes

02:04.875 --> 02:07.125
or a place to stay.

02:07.125 --> 02:09.291
Are you kidding?
You're gonna crash with me.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.500
Really?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.250
Yeah. Where else
would you stay?

02:13.250 --> 02:15.959
Oh, come on,
it'll be like old times.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.625
Wow. Uh, I...
I don't know what to say

02:18.625 --> 02:20.417
but thank you.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.084
No need for thank yous.

02:22.084 --> 02:23.583
Just admit

02:23.583 --> 02:27.209
that Lexi Samuels is the
best best-friend ever.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.083
-Got a minute?
-[gasps]

02:35.083 --> 02:36.917
-Whoa! It's okay.
-Oh!

02:37.834 --> 02:39.708
-God, you scared me.
-Just me.

02:39.708 --> 02:41.959
Sorry. I'm just a little
jumpy from everything

02:41.959 --> 02:43.583
that happened last night.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.542
Speaking of last night...

02:46.875 --> 02:48.500
So, I'm sorry for...

02:52.125 --> 02:54.458
Okay, how do I say this?

02:54.458 --> 02:57.708
Um, drunkenly
propositioning you.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.084
It's okay.

02:59.084 --> 03:01.000
But just for clarification,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.583
are you apologizing
for coming on to me

03:03.583 --> 03:05.167
or the fact
that you were drunk

03:05.167 --> 03:06.708
when you did it?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.542
Come on, no girl wants
to be a drooling idiot

03:08.542 --> 03:10.166
when it's her first time.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.875
Your first time?

03:15.166 --> 03:17.166
Awkward moment.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.959
I'm hungry.
Do you want something?

03:19.959 --> 03:21.333
Pretzels? Yogurt?

03:21.333 --> 03:23.875
Yogurt... Pretzels?

03:24.583 --> 03:25.667
Wait a second.

03:26.917 --> 03:29.625
I just think we don't have to
talk about this right now.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.750
It's what we've been telling
Sutton her whole life.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.750
Yes, and I've never been
comfortable with it.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.500
[Kristin] I know it shouldn't
make a difference

03:35.500 --> 03:38.250
but Sutton has been
so wonderful lately.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.875
We've grown closer than ever.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.041
[Ted] Exactly! So why would
you want to jeopardize that?

03:42.041 --> 03:43.375
I think it's time to tell her.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.500
We don't actually know that
her birth mother is dead.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.167
[Kristin] You've seen
how she's been lately

03:48.167 --> 03:49.875
asking all these
questions about her past.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.209
And if we have the answers
to some of those questions

03:52.209 --> 03:53.500
don't you think we
should tell her?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.000
I just think it's too risky.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.458
I guess
I just don't know anymore.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.792
[cell phone ringing]

04:13.000 --> 04:14.291
Hello, Ted.

04:14.291 --> 04:17.333
Alec, yeah. Look, I think
I may have a situation.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, you and me both.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.041
[Ted]  It's Kristin.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.375
I think she's gonna tell
Sutton about her birth mother.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.917
[Alec]  That wouldn't be good
would it?

04:23.917 --> 04:25.000
And I don't get it.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.917
We've kept this united
front for 17 years almost.

04:27.917 --> 04:31.583
Ted, Kristin is a very...
Honest person.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.583
I know,
that's why I love her.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.208
Yeah, me, too.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.917
But you need to get your
wife under control, man.

04:37.917 --> 04:40.209
We both know why Sutton
can never find out

04:40.209 --> 04:41.792
who her birth mother is.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.167
♪ Uh ♪

04:54.167 --> 04:55.542
♪ Uh, uh-uh ♪

04:55.542 --> 04:57.834
♪ Uh, uh-uh, uh ♪

04:57.834 --> 04:59.375

04:59.375 --> 05:02.500
♪ She's got a gun
for a tongue ♪

05:04.166 --> 05:08.041
Okay, so Ted obviously knows
that Sutton is Annie's kid.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.041
And now...

05:10.041 --> 05:12.375
Alec wants to make sure
that she never finds out.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.375
Yes, but the question is why?

05:14.375 --> 05:17.458
Is it really worth the
trouble to cover up

05:17.458 --> 05:19.209
some shady adoption?

05:19.209 --> 05:20.917
Why don't you talk
to Kristin about it?

05:20.917 --> 05:22.875
I mean, she sounded
like she wanted to talk.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.834
That's what I'm going to do.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.417
And not just her,
I'm gonna ask Alec.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.667
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

05:27.667 --> 05:28.917
As pissed as Sutton is now

05:28.917 --> 05:31.209
when she gets back here,
the only way

05:31.209 --> 05:32.959
that she's gonna
let me stay is...

05:32.959 --> 05:34.792
Is if I have
some answers for her.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.834
You clearly disagree
with me. What?

05:40.875 --> 05:43.000
Emma, look, I'm trying
to be supportive here.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.917
I just want to make
sure that this is

05:45.875 --> 05:47.125
what you want.

05:47.125 --> 05:51.166
Ethan, I have never been
more sure about anything.

05:53.708 --> 05:54.708
[dog barking]

05:56.583 --> 05:58.167
Welcome home.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.167
[camera clicking]

06:03.167 --> 06:04.417
Nice.

06:04.417 --> 06:05.959
-What are you doing?
-Oh, you know me.

06:05.959 --> 06:07.500
Just capturing a moment.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.834
And do you really think this
moment is worth capturing?

06:10.834 --> 06:13.500
Ems, no moment is too small.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.834
So, as you can see,
we remodeled the place.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.834
Really?

06:17.834 --> 06:19.125
Oh, yeah.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.875
Come on, your place is nice.

06:21.542 --> 06:22.708
Thanks.

06:22.708 --> 06:26.125
Well, it's a lot nicer
than Clarice's house.

06:26.125 --> 06:29.583
But I bet your place in
Phoenix was pretty sweet.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.542
Ooh, and your mom's
place in California,

06:31.542 --> 06:32.875
what was that like?

06:32.875 --> 06:34.625
-Mmm...
-Is she loaded?

06:34.625 --> 06:36.625
Actually, the place
she's staying sucks.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.125
Kind of why I have
to get back there.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.125
Is this your way of
bumming another ride?

06:40.125 --> 06:41.291
'Cause we have school
in the morning.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.000
"School"? No. I...
I have to--

06:44.000 --> 06:45.792
Emma!

06:45.792 --> 06:47.750
Oh, I heard you were back.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.500
I heard you got
in trouble, too.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.417
What'd you do,
go on another crime spree

06:53.417 --> 06:55.625
whacking people with
your tennis racket?

06:55.625 --> 06:58.250
-[chuckling]
-No,
that was a misunderstanding.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.834
Hey, it's--
It's good to see you again.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.083
Dang, moneybags,
you hit the jackpot?

07:07.083 --> 07:09.583
Couple of Dallas
high rollers on a $100 table.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.000
-Oh, yeah.
-Big tippers.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.959
[chuckles]

07:12.959 --> 07:14.333
Are you hungry, Emma?

07:14.333 --> 07:16.542
You want some mac and cheese?

07:16.542 --> 07:19.083
Oh! That would be fantastic.
Thank you.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.834
Milk and butter's in the
fridge. Knock yourself out.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.708
I'm gonna take a bath. Muah!

07:32.333 --> 07:34.917
Well, someone looks
snazzy in a suit.

07:36.084 --> 07:37.250
It's a big dinner.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.375
My dad is hooking me up with
this venture capitalist guy

07:39.375 --> 07:42.834
who might want to
invest in my company.

07:42.834 --> 07:45.084
Wow, how supportive of him.

07:45.084 --> 07:47.084
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hey, he's not here, is he?

07:47.084 --> 07:49.959
I just have a
question for him.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.167
Seriously? Don't tell me
you found

07:51.167 --> 07:52.959
something new to be
suspicious about.

07:52.959 --> 07:55.583
Oh, no, it's just,
it's a legal question
for school.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.959
Yeah.

07:57.959 --> 08:02.209
Hey, you haven't heard
from Sutton, have you?

08:02.209 --> 08:03.750
No, not a word.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.291
I mean, I thought
she'd be back in L.A.

08:05.291 --> 08:06.917
but I called my landlady,

08:06.917 --> 08:08.166
she says she hasn't
seen her in days.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.167
You don't think
anything bad happened?

08:10.167 --> 08:12.708
Uh, I'll put it
to you this way.

08:12.708 --> 08:14.917
I would be a lot more
worried if I didn't know

08:14.917 --> 08:16.125
how long that girl
can hold a grudge.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.291
Sutton.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.792
What a pleasant surprise.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.667
T, where's your sister?

08:23.667 --> 08:24.959
Our reservation's
in ten minutes.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.959
Yeah, I just texted her,
she's on her way.

08:26.959 --> 08:30.042
Oh, and I think Sutton has
some legal questions for you.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.125
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.959
Oh, no, it can wait.
You guys have dinner.

08:32.959 --> 08:34.000
I don't want to interrupt.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.166
No, there's plenty of room.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.167
Why don't you join us
and you can ask me

08:37.167 --> 08:39.125
-all the questions you want.
-[cell phone ringing]

08:40.125 --> 08:42.125
Uh, okay.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.708
I gotta take this.
Would you excuse me?

08:43.708 --> 08:45.000
Yeah. See you in the lounge.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.083
[cell phone beeps]

08:51.083 --> 08:53.959
Dr. Hughes, this isn't
really a good time.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.708
Is this something we
can discuss later?

08:55.708 --> 08:57.583
I'm afraid not.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.125
It's Annie Hobbs.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.166
She's escaped.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.583
[Sutton] Bus fare, 80 bucks?

09:07.583 --> 09:10.542
Why don't you just hit up
your fancy twin for the cash?

09:10.542 --> 09:12.417
Mmm. Yeah, that's
not going to happen.

09:12.417 --> 09:13.750
Why?

09:13.750 --> 09:18.500
Lexi, Sutton and I are not
exactly besties right now.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
Kind of figured she
might turn out to be

09:20.000 --> 09:21.750
an entitled little bitch.

09:21.750 --> 09:22.959
But, anyways,

09:22.959 --> 09:24.959
uh, here's the clothes that
you left at my house

09:24.959 --> 09:26.667
the night we snuck
into the Fleet Foxes show.

09:26.667 --> 09:30.000
And, uh, other various
borrowed items.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.708
I don't think this
fits me anymore.

09:31.708 --> 09:33.083
Gained weight.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.333
Wow, I'm just kidding. Sorry.

09:36.333 --> 09:37.917
If you don't like
any of these,

09:37.917 --> 09:39.542
you can just raid my closet,
or my mom's.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.792
She doesn't care.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.500
Just don't forget to
put everything back.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.083
And you are never
going to guess

09:45.083 --> 09:46.583
who's here to see you.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.000
Sweetheart.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.458
Let me get a look at you.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.000
You had me so worried.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.625
I did?

10:00.625 --> 10:03.000
I know there's been some
bad blood between us

10:03.000 --> 10:07.041
but, honey.
I want to fix that.

10:07.041 --> 10:11.000
Hey, would you two mind giving
us a minute to catch up?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.583
-Yeah, kinda.
-Lexi.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.625
Evidence.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.750
Ems, holler if you need me.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.625
So, Clarice...

10:24.625 --> 10:25.959
How you doing?

10:25.959 --> 10:28.542
Oh, shut up, you
ungrateful little bitch.

10:28.542 --> 10:31.041
Do you have any idea
what kind of trouble
you put me through?

10:32.166 --> 10:34.084
I guess not.

10:34.084 --> 10:35.750
After you left, they took away

10:35.750 --> 10:37.333
my license to be
a foster parent.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.084
Now I got to wait
18 months

10:39.084 --> 10:41.875
before they'll even
think of placing
a child in my care.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.375
Do you know
what that means, Emma?

10:43.375 --> 10:46.041
What, that you're
a disgruntled empty-nester?

10:46.041 --> 10:48.042
It means the checks
stop coming.

10:48.042 --> 10:49.166
You owe me.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.834
First of all...

10:51.792 --> 10:54.042
Get out of my face, Clarice.

10:54.042 --> 10:55.250
You smell like an
airport bathroom.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.542
Second, I owe you nothing!

10:56.542 --> 10:58.000
You are a terrible person

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
you're not my mother,
and if you ever,
do you hear me?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Ever put your
hands on me again

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
you will be asking
for a world of hurt.
Got it?

11:15.125 --> 11:16.750
And the best thing
is these apps

11:16.750 --> 11:18.834
work on multiple platforms...

11:18.834 --> 11:20.000
Facebook, Twitter

11:20.000 --> 11:21.834
next month, Google Plus.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.333
That way we can establish the
widest user base possible.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, well, I got to say,
Thayer, I'm impressed.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.458
Your dad told me
how talented you were

11:30.458 --> 11:31.834
and you proved it.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.542
I think the next step is
to take you to the office

11:34.542 --> 11:35.834
meet my boss.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.291
I tell you, Thayer's a genius.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.917
He's even got me
playing these games

11:38.917 --> 11:40.750
and you know how
I hate this stuff.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.125
Thayer actually is
kind of genius.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.834
Oh, that's right,
Derek and Char
are celebrating.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.125
Ten-day anniversary...

11:54.125 --> 11:55.083
Kind of a big deal for her.

11:58.291 --> 12:00.125
-Char and who?
-Derek.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.000
You remember Derek.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.291
Didn't you help him out

12:03.291 --> 12:05.375
with some
community service
or something?

12:05.375 --> 12:08.417
Derek... Derek,
right, nice kid.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.917
He had some brushes
with the law,

12:09.917 --> 12:11.583
needed a push
in the right direction.

12:11.583 --> 12:14.041
You had a question
for me earlier.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.708
What was it, something legal?

12:15.708 --> 12:20.500
Well, I'm writing a paper
on perjury and...

12:20.500 --> 12:23.084
Well, I was wondering,
as a lawyer,

12:23.084 --> 12:27.500
how can you tell if someone
is hiding something?

12:27.500 --> 12:30.166
That's an excellent
question, Sutton.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.084
You know, it's not
really an exact science

12:34.084 --> 12:36.208
but, uh, generally

12:36.208 --> 12:40.167
when someone's not
being 100% honest

12:40.167 --> 12:43.875
there's a lack of eye contact,
a rise in vocal pitch,

12:43.875 --> 12:45.458
uh, fidgety behavior.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.500
Oh, so would you say, like...

12:48.333 --> 12:49.458
Drumming...

12:50.083 --> 12:52.083
Your fingers on the couch...

12:53.250 --> 12:54.917
Like that kind of behavior?

12:56.125 --> 12:57.125
Well...

12:59.125 --> 13:02.167
Like I said, it's not
an exact science, you know.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.583
Yeah, will you guys
excuse me for a second?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.375
I think I left
my wallet in my locker.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.834
[chuckles]

13:11.834 --> 13:14.959
Uh, babe, I got to
hit the bathroom.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.375
-Be right back.
-Okay.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.167
-Hey, Alec, what's up?
-You tell me.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.625
You're the one sitting down
with Char, hanging out.

13:26.625 --> 13:28.291
You getting information?
What do you got for me?

13:28.291 --> 13:31.000
Uh, nothing right now.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.042
It's actually more
of a personal dinner.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.084
Oh, personal?

13:35.084 --> 13:36.875
Getting to know each
other a little bit?

13:36.875 --> 13:39.041
That's cute.
How are her grades?

13:39.041 --> 13:41.125
No, what's her favorite song?

13:42.208 --> 13:44.250
You really want to
know that stuff?

13:44.250 --> 13:48.166
No. Because it's useless,
just like you.

13:48.166 --> 13:52.291
The idea was for you to get
her to fall in love with you,
not the other way around.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.500
You're getting soft, man,
you've become
a liability to me.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.125
Now, you go
in there right now
and break up with her.

14:00.209 --> 14:01.750
You're kidding.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.542
Do I look like I'm kidding?

14:03.542 --> 14:05.667
Come on, Alec,
I've been loyal to you.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.125
I've done everything
you've asked.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.333
Which is why you're gonna
go in there right now
and finish it.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.917
Sutton, where are you going?

14:21.166 --> 14:23.167
I was just gonna get some air.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.750
Why don't you join
me back at the table?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.625
Laurel, honey,
could I talk to you a second?

14:38.625 --> 14:40.750
Can we do it later?
I'm sort of in a hurry here.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.959
Actually, it's kind
of important.

14:42.959 --> 14:46.000
Important like, "I forgot
to take out the trash
last night" important,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.291
or important like
someone's dying?

14:51.500 --> 14:52.542
Oh.

14:54.042 --> 14:57.167
I found it in the wash.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.875
It must have fallen
out of your pocket.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.375
I thought you said you
and Justin were waiting.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.834
Yeah, um...

15:05.166 --> 15:07.000
And then I guess
we kind of stopped.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.500
Look, I'm not mad.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.708
It's just, there are a lot of
issues to be considered here.

15:12.708 --> 15:16.084
You're 16 years old.
This is a really big step.

15:16.084 --> 15:18.083
Mom, Justin and
I love each other.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.042
Sweetheart, you may think
you love him.

15:20.042 --> 15:22.458
You... You barely know him.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.041
Oh, right,
'cause I'm just a kid.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.209
How could I possibly know
who I'm in love with?

15:26.209 --> 15:28.042
You're getting upset.
I just want to be able to

15:28.042 --> 15:29.208
talk honestly about this.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.625
No, you want to
tell me what to do,

15:31.625 --> 15:33.458
and that's why I can't
talk about this.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.875
-How was your first day?
-Not great.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.417
Just spent the morning
in the attendance office

16:29.417 --> 16:32.041
learning about the
perils of truancy.

16:32.041 --> 16:35.375
Ah. Well, I mean,
you did kind of fall
off the face of the Earth.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.041
-Here.
-What is this?

16:38.041 --> 16:41.417
It's, it's lunch...
Brown bag full of food.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.166
I believe you're familiar
with the concept.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.875
Hey, can we just
pause for a moment

16:45.875 --> 16:48.000
and talk about this little
outfit you're rocking today?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.167
Oh, well, you know,
your mom said

16:50.167 --> 16:51.875
I could borrow some
stuff from her closet.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.375
Yeah, but you, like,

16:53.375 --> 16:55.667
totally Oscar De La Hoya'd it.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.041
-"De La Renta."
-Whatever.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.583
What happened to the old Emma?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.875
You know, "Keep a low
profile until we graduate

17:01.875 --> 17:03.167
"and get the hell out
of here"?

17:03.167 --> 17:05.000
Oh, well, I mean,
that's still the plan

17:05.000 --> 17:07.458
but might as well look good
while we're doing it, right?

17:07.458 --> 17:08.875
Hey, guys.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.209
Hi.

17:11.209 --> 17:13.625
-Emma, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.625
Kelvin Timmons.
You might remember me.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.083
I'm pretty sure
you're the girl

17:18.083 --> 17:20.125
who keyed the word "ass-hat"

17:20.125 --> 17:21.542
into my locker last year.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.625
No, that doesn't
sound like me.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.917
It was you.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.750
Anyway,
that's all in the past,
and to prove it...

17:29.167 --> 17:30.500
I'm having
a little casino party

17:30.500 --> 17:31.959
tonight at my dad's hotel.

17:31.959 --> 17:35.042
Just a few friends,
$100 buy-in,

17:35.042 --> 17:36.792
but you don't have to
gamble if you don't want to.

17:38.542 --> 17:41.000
I would love for you to come.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Oh, and your friend, too.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.959
-Oh, thanks.
-We'll think about it.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.875
Cool, hope to see you tonight.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.291
"We'll think about it"?

17:51.291 --> 17:52.542
Hmm, yeah, why wouldn't we?

17:52.542 --> 17:55.166
Maybe because parties
like that are cesspools

17:55.166 --> 17:57.667
full of skanks, jocks,
and bro-dudes

17:57.667 --> 18:00.125
with double-digit IQs.

18:00.125 --> 18:03.000
Oh, what about his friend,
the guy in the jacket?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.166
Don't tell me you weren't
just totally eye-humping him.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.083
Okay, he's pretty to look at

18:08.083 --> 18:10.125
but it doesn't mean I
want to go party with him.

18:13.042 --> 18:14.583
Ooh, they just sat down,
let's go.

18:16.042 --> 18:19.625
Nice try,
but we sit over here.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.917
Den mothers of the
disenfranchised

18:25.917 --> 18:28.625
is a really tough job,
but someone's got to do it.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.083
Swaggin' wagon, what's up?

18:32.083 --> 18:33.834
-Hey, Lexi.
-What's goin' on?

18:40.291 --> 18:43.041
Hello, my sexy,
wonderful boyfriend
of 11 days.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.209
Hey, is everything okay?

18:49.625 --> 18:51.333
Not really.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.125
Char, there's something I
got to talk to you about.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.708
Boy, this is tough.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.834
I've had a lot of fun
these last few days.

19:01.834 --> 19:02.875
No.

19:04.084 --> 19:07.209
Derek, you're not going
to do this. You can't.

19:08.084 --> 19:10.917
I'm Char Chamberlin, remember?

19:14.333 --> 19:15.875
[Char] I don't know
what happened.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.417
He broke up with
me out of the blue

19:17.417 --> 19:18.750
and I have no idea why.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.209
Char, I'm so sorry.

19:21.209 --> 19:23.667
[sobs] Why would he do this?
Everything was so great.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.917
It's guys, isn't it?
They're so selfish
and unpredictable.

19:29.458 --> 19:33.042
Char, I, I think it might be
more complicated than that.

19:33.042 --> 19:34.583
What do you mean?

19:35.708 --> 19:36.834
Did Derek say something?

19:36.834 --> 19:39.125
No. No, I just...

19:41.083 --> 19:44.209
I saw him last night
at the club talking to Alec.

19:44.209 --> 19:47.042
Seriously, Sutton?
Not this Alec thing again.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.667
If Derek was talking to him,

19:49.667 --> 19:52.000
it was about his
probation or whatever.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.375
Look, I don't know
what was said,
I couldn't hear it

19:55.375 --> 19:58.291
but I know that Derek
looked really upset.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.250
Why would Alec care
who Derek's dating?

20:00.250 --> 20:02.375
I don't know,
but when you consider
the timing of it

20:02.375 --> 20:03.667
and what happened with Eduardo

20:03.667 --> 20:05.959
I'm just saying Alec
could be capable

20:05.959 --> 20:08.125
of a lot more than we think.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.834
-Hey, honey.
-Hey.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.417
What's that?

20:13.417 --> 20:15.917
One of Sutton's
birthday presents.

20:15.917 --> 20:18.667
-Big day's around the corner.
-I know.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.166
Can you believe it?
Seventeen?

20:23.166 --> 20:25.625
Sweetie, I just want
to apologize for yesterday.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.542
You know I always want
to be honest with Sutton.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.792
We can talk
about that later, but for now,

20:29.792 --> 20:32.000
we may want to try being
honest with ourselves.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.208
Right.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.208
What are we talking about?

20:36.208 --> 20:39.333
Laurel and Justin are
sleeping together.

20:41.083 --> 20:44.209
They... They told us
that they were waiting.

20:44.209 --> 20:47.083
Yeah, well, they lied,
and we were so quick
to believe them

20:47.083 --> 20:49.291
because that is
what we wanted to believe.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.167
-So, what, are we idiots?
-No, we're parents.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.000
I already spoke to Laurel,
or tried to.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.333
You have to speak to Justin.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.458
I got to be honest,
that may be a little difficult

20:58.458 --> 21:00.917
without me beating
him to death with my putter.

21:00.917 --> 21:02.250
Besides, why does
it have to be me?

21:02.250 --> 21:04.291
Well, we took him
under our wing

21:04.291 --> 21:06.458
and whether we like it or not

21:06.458 --> 21:09.209
we're the closest thing
to parents he's got.

21:09.209 --> 21:11.583
[Emma] Mom, can I talk to you?

21:11.583 --> 21:13.333
Yeah, what's going on?

21:13.333 --> 21:15.834
I was kind of hoping
I could have a moment alone.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.000
Yeah.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.166
-Hi, hon.
-Hi, Dad.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.125
What's going on?

21:24.125 --> 21:26.125
[stammers] Okay, I don't
really know how to say this.

21:27.625 --> 21:31.125
I... I overheard you
and Dad arguing yesterday.

21:31.125 --> 21:34.125
Well, I mean, if you're
going to live in this house

21:34.125 --> 21:36.458
that sometimes happens.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.708
Yeah, but this was different.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.041
You guys were arguing
over whether or not

21:42.041 --> 21:45.250
you should tell me the
truth about something

21:45.250 --> 21:47.125
and I want to know what it is.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.209
I just...

21:50.209 --> 21:52.125
It just doesn't ring a bell.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.583
Maybe you misheard something

21:53.583 --> 21:56.834
or you just caught
part of a conversation and...

21:57.291 --> 21:58.792
And misunderstood.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.209
Yeah, that must be it.

22:03.209 --> 22:05.208
I have to take this upstairs.

22:11.209 --> 22:13.209
Are we seriously going
to do this all day?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.542
Study? Yes.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.375
I've got a French test
on Friday, and, unlike you

22:18.375 --> 22:20.209
I haven't blown off
an entire semester

22:20.209 --> 22:22.209
putting my collegiate
future in jeopardy.

22:22.209 --> 22:24.084
Wait a minute. Hold on.

22:24.084 --> 22:26.209
You said the
test is on Friday?

22:26.209 --> 22:27.708
Okay, so that's
four days away.

22:27.708 --> 22:29.500
Why are you studying
for that now?

22:29.500 --> 22:33.208
Because we can't all have
a natural knack
for languages, Em.

22:33.208 --> 22:34.583
Oh, come on,
I'm not that good.

22:34.583 --> 22:37.625
Oh, please.
You're, like,
a conjugation wizard.

22:37.625 --> 22:41.875
[speaking French]

22:41.875 --> 22:43.750
Oh, come on,
just help me out here.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.667
You know what would be so fun?

22:46.667 --> 22:48.750
Oh, that stupid casino party.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.250
No. Put that away.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.291
We make fun of people
who go to stuff like that.

22:52.291 --> 22:54.084
No. So?

22:54.084 --> 22:56.875
We can make fun
of them to their faces

22:56.875 --> 22:58.417
while we're taking
their money.

22:58.417 --> 23:01.250
Money which, may I remind you,
I so desperately need.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.834
May I remind you
that the buy-in

23:02.834 --> 23:05.041
for that is
the same price
as a bus ticket?

23:05.041 --> 23:06.458
You're broke.

23:06.458 --> 23:08.708
Kind of don't see
how it's possible.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.625
Yes, but there's
money in the cookie jar,
right?

23:11.625 --> 23:13.167
Not your money.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.959
We'll put it back in
after we win.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.834
Come on,
it'll be an adventure.

23:17.834 --> 23:20.792
An adventure in getting
my ass kicked.

23:20.792 --> 23:24.000
Hot guy in the jacket's
gonna be there.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.041
Darn.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.625
Come on, I'll be
your best friend.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.125
Oh, it's kind of late
for that.

23:29.333 --> 23:32.291
-Oh, don't give me the look.
-Please.

23:32.291 --> 23:35.708
[laughing]
Okay, fine, fine, we can go.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.209
And you know that little,
uh...

23:38.209 --> 23:40.333
Number you've done
on your ensemble earlier?

23:41.792 --> 23:43.417
Can you work some
of that magic on me?

23:44.708 --> 23:46.291
Definitely.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.959
[phone ringing]

23:50.333 --> 23:51.500
Hello?

23:51.500 --> 23:53.208
[woman]  Charlotte Chamberlin?

23:53.208 --> 23:55.417
Uh, yeah.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.042
We've never actually met.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.875
My name's Annie.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.375
I'm your aunt.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.708
Aunt Annie. What a surprise.

24:03.708 --> 24:07.250
Um, it's nice to meet you,
I guess.

24:08.208 --> 24:10.708
I suppose you're
calling for my mom.

24:10.708 --> 24:13.875
No, actually,
I wanted to speak to you.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.917
Annie, hello. Are you there?

24:16.917 --> 24:18.625
Damn it, Annie, answer me!

24:18.625 --> 24:19.750
[dial tone]

24:19.750 --> 24:20.750
[cell phone beeps]

24:22.000 --> 24:23.458
What was that?

24:23.458 --> 24:25.417
You're never to talk
to that woman again.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.083
-Do you understand?
-No, I don't.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.542
What happened between
the two of you?

24:29.542 --> 24:31.375
And why won't
you talk about it?

24:31.375 --> 24:33.417
Your aunt made
a series of poor decisions,

24:33.417 --> 24:35.209
got mixed up
with the wrong people.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.042
And they destroyed her.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.750
So, why don't you do
something about it?

24:42.208 --> 24:43.333
I mean, you're her sister.

24:43.333 --> 24:46.041
Trust me, honey,
I've spent years trying

24:46.041 --> 24:47.542
but the person
you just spoke with

24:47.542 --> 24:49.417
stopped being
my sister long ago.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.041
I asked Kristin flat out,

24:54.041 --> 24:56.458
"What were you and
Dad arguing about?"

24:56.458 --> 24:58.209
-And what did she say?
-Nothing.

24:58.209 --> 24:59.792
Maybe she wanted
to tell me the truth

24:59.792 --> 25:01.291
but the fact is,
she didn't, and...

25:02.208 --> 25:03.625
[sighs] I don't know.

25:03.625 --> 25:06.667
Sutton's right.
Kristin's lying.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.500
-I mean, they all are.
-Okay.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.375
Well, don't you think now

25:11.375 --> 25:13.458
is where you should
walk away from this?

25:13.458 --> 25:15.000
Let Sutton deal
with this when she gets back.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.625
What, and give up?

25:16.625 --> 25:17.917
There's got to be another way.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.208
This is my only shot
before I get shipped back

25:20.208 --> 25:23.250
on a bus to Vegas or wherever,
and, you know,

25:23.250 --> 25:26.375
I just have to keep going,
and why are you looking
at me like that?

25:26.375 --> 25:27.750
It's nothing.

25:27.750 --> 25:31.291
It's just your optimism...
It's kind of relentless.

25:31.291 --> 25:33.708
Oh. You find that amusing?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.250
No.

Not entirely.

26:01.166 --> 26:03.166
Anything I can help with?

26:05.583 --> 26:07.208
Justin, when you came
into my daughter's life,

26:07.208 --> 26:09.375
into my family's life,

26:09.375 --> 26:11.000
I thought we had an agreement.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.167
To always respect
your daughter.

26:13.167 --> 26:14.917
I take it very seriously.

26:17.792 --> 26:21.750
But I think I see
what you're driving at.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.000
You know that Laurel and I...

26:23.000 --> 26:24.125
Yeah.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.083
Wow. I'm sure that was
a hard thing to hear.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.250
I mean, obviously,
I'm not a father.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.333
Yet.

26:33.542 --> 26:35.000
That's why I wanted to
talk to you.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.208
-You weren't honest with me.
-I know. I'm sorry.

26:38.167 --> 26:39.458
I should have known better.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.041
I know
what lies can do to people.

How it can tear
a family apart.

26:44.041 --> 26:45.041
[sighs]

26:46.500 --> 26:48.875
I guess that's why you're
my role model, sir.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.209
Because I know
you'd never lie.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.000
Right?

26:56.667 --> 26:58.041
Sutton, you got a second?

26:59.042 --> 27:00.375
Uh, yeah.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.042
What's going on?

27:02.042 --> 27:04.792
You will not believe
what happened this morning.

27:04.792 --> 27:08.000
Hmm. At this point,
I'm pretty sure
I'd believe anything.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Mom found a condom
in the wash.

27:11.583 --> 27:12.959
I must've left it
in my pocket

27:12.959 --> 27:14.250
when I stayed
the night at Justin's.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.375
What did you tell her?

27:15.375 --> 27:17.583
Well, there wasn't
really much I could say.

27:17.583 --> 27:20.125
Although I did
briefly consider telling her
it was yours.

27:21.167 --> 27:23.125
Of course. More lies.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.959
Isn't that how everyone
handles things around here?

27:24.959 --> 27:26.500
Geez, what's your problem?

27:26.500 --> 27:27.667
I'm the one in trouble here.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.000
Maybe if you'd
have told Mom and Dad

27:29.000 --> 27:32.041
what was going on,
you wouldn't have this issue.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.708
Okay, hold on.

27:33.708 --> 27:36.167
You're going to lecture
me on telling the truth?

27:36.167 --> 27:39.000
Laurel, the only way
this family is ever going
to work

27:39.000 --> 27:40.959

honest with each other.

28:50.417 --> 28:51.834
I'm sorry.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.750
Not for sleeping with Justin

28:54.750 --> 28:58.667
because I still feel
like that was
my choice to make.

28:58.667 --> 29:03.542
But I am
really sorry for lying
to you and Dad.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.625
There's never
a good reason for that.

29:05.625 --> 29:09.834
I hope you know you can
always talk to us.
About anything.

29:09.834 --> 29:13.542

with this particular...

29:13.542 --> 29:16.375
Subject, I...

29:18.000 --> 29:21.084
I guess I was worried
about what you would
think of me.

29:21.084 --> 29:23.125
Honey, you're my daughter.
I love you.

29:25.708 --> 29:28.167

if I said I was comfortable

not to wait.

29:30.209 --> 29:31.542

29:31.542 --> 29:34.625
is just that we're
honest with each other.

29:41.209 --> 29:43.875

how to play blackjack.

29:56.625 --> 29:57.917
Yeah,
and the dealer has a six.

It's not even enough

30:51.834 --> 30:53.417
Well, we can figure
that out later. Let's go.

30:53.417 --> 30:57.458
No, I... Just one more hand.
That's it. I swear.

30:57.458 --> 31:00.042
Okay, but one more,
and I mean it.

31:03.083 --> 31:06.208
-Oh, my God.
-Wow,
that's kind of a big bet.

31:06.208 --> 31:07.542
I mean, for anybody.

31:07.542 --> 31:08.917
-Are you sure?
-He's right.

31:08.917 --> 31:10.125
Are you crazy?

31:10.125 --> 31:11.959
I went all in.
People do it all the time.

31:11.959 --> 31:13.083
Yeah, broke people.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.667
Okay, hit me.

31:19.041 --> 31:20.208
That's 17.

31:20.208 --> 31:21.291
Yes.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.708
Give me another card.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.333
-Really?
-No, Emma.

31:26.333 --> 31:29.125
What are you doing?
Nobody hits a hard 17. Ever.

31:29.125 --> 31:31.209
Well, then,
look at me breaking the rules.

31:31.209 --> 31:32.583
Card, please.

31:32.583 --> 31:33.834
I'm gonna throw up.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.291
Nineteen!

31:37.291 --> 31:39.917
-I'm good.
-Yes, you are. Here we go.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.375
Done.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.917
We win!

31:46.917 --> 31:49.583
Oh, my God, we win, we win.

31:49.583 --> 31:52.125
You're an idiot, but we win!

31:52.125 --> 31:55.000
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.083
Kelvin, can I just talk
to you over here
for a minute?

31:58.083 --> 31:59.208
Sure.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.375
[sighs] Okay.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.792
You let me win, didn't you?

32:07.792 --> 32:10.083
That last card wasn't
supposed to be a jack.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.250
Wait, are you saying
that I rigged my own game

32:12.250 --> 32:13.500
just to impress you?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.208
Give you your money back?

32:15.208 --> 32:17.667
Mm, that's
quite an accusation.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.417
Okay, well, then, let's head
on back to the table, because

32:20.417 --> 32:22.208
I'm clearly on
an incredible hot streak.

32:22.208 --> 32:26.167
Whoa. Okay, I'm not saying
I rigged it.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.708
I'm just saying,
you might want to quit
while you're ahead.

32:30.458 --> 32:31.959
Okay.

32:31.959 --> 32:33.291
Thanks, I guess.

32:33.291 --> 32:34.667
No problem.

32:34.667 --> 32:36.500
So can I get
you that drink now?

32:36.500 --> 32:38.458
Mm, thanks,
but I'm gonna go find Lexi.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.167
-She's my ride.
-Well, remember.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.792
If you don't find her

32:42.792 --> 32:45.084
you can always crash
here with me.

32:45.084 --> 32:47.250
Kelvin, I think
you better quit
while you're ahead.

33:07.458 --> 33:09.542
[Kristin] You were right.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.083
There is something
you don't know

33:11.083 --> 33:14.125
something we should have
told you years ago.

33:16.042 --> 33:17.625
Okay.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.959
I tried telling myself,
I did it to protect you.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.084
The truth is,
I was afraid of losing you.

33:23.583 --> 33:24.792
Mom...

33:26.042 --> 33:28.000
Whatever it is,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.959
I promise
that won't ever happen.

33:33.041 --> 33:35.458
Sutton, your birth mother
may still be alive.

33:36.792 --> 33:39.083
And I'm so sorry we lied.

33:39.959 --> 33:41.000
No, you don't have to explain.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.834
I just want to know
everything you know.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.708
Well, I don't have
many details,

33:44.708 --> 33:46.792
just, she was
a very troubled woman.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.417
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.000
You've told me that.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.042
What was her name?

33:52.042 --> 33:55.083
But you know her name.
It's on the birth certificate.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.333
Ruth Peterson.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.084
And that's the truth?

34:00.708 --> 34:02.000
Yes.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.500
I can't tell you
what a relief it is

34:03.500 --> 34:05.291
to finally be able
to share this with you.

34:05.291 --> 34:08.042
And I promise you,
if it's important to you

34:08.042 --> 34:10.291
I will do
everything I can
to help you find her.

34:14.583 --> 34:17.708
So Kristin has no idea
that Annie Hobbs
is a part of this?

34:17.708 --> 34:19.458
As far as Kristin knows,

34:19.458 --> 34:23.208
Annie was
Phyllis's weirdo sister.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.917
She has no idea
that Sutton has a twin

34:25.917 --> 34:28.042
and, my favorite part,

34:28.042 --> 34:29.667
no idea Ted's lying to her.

34:29.667 --> 34:30.667
[scoffs]

34:31.000 --> 34:32.166
Wow!

34:32.166 --> 34:36.250
And she has felt guilty
for all these years

34:36.250 --> 34:37.917
for hiding
this story from Sutton

34:37.917 --> 34:41.417
and the whole time,
the story has been a lie.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.125
So maybe it's time
you tell Kristin

34:43.125 --> 34:44.542
what you know.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.875
I can't.
She's way too fragile.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.583
It would destroy her.

34:48.583 --> 34:51.125
Ethan, I would hate
it if the last thing

34:51.125 --> 34:53.417
I did with this family was
tear them apart.

34:53.417 --> 34:56.333
-Well, what about you?
-What about me?

34:56.333 --> 34:59.542
What about what you want?
These people are lying to you.

34:59.542 --> 35:02.208
They lied to Sutton.
They're lying to each other.

35:02.208 --> 35:04.041
They sit around
at their ballet recitals

35:04.041 --> 35:05.750
sipping
their eight-dollar latte

35:05.750 --> 35:08.083
with a smile on their face
like there's nothing wrong.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.333
Why do you keep
protecting them?

35:09.333 --> 35:13.042
Because they're
my family, Ethan.

35:13.042 --> 35:16.917
Well, at least,
the closest thing I've...
Got.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.834
-Emma.
-What?

35:19.834 --> 35:22.834
Stop worrying
about other people.

35:22.834 --> 35:24.166
Start worrying about you.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.667
[bell rings]

35:31.083 --> 35:33.708
Okay, so the weirdest thing
happened yesterday.

35:33.708 --> 35:35.209
Remember my mom's sister,
the one

35:35.209 --> 35:36.708
we're not supposed
to talk about?

35:36.708 --> 35:39.458
Yeah. Annie, right?

35:39.458 --> 35:41.375
Yeah.
Well, she called my house.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.834
You're kidding.

35:42.834 --> 35:45.125
-You actually talked to her?
-Barely.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.000
My mom grabbed
the phone from me so fast,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.708
I thought she was
gonna rip my arm off.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.667
-So, did she say anything?
-Nothing.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.542
She didn't give anything out.

35:57.041 --> 35:59.792
I talked to Sutton last night.

36:00.417 --> 36:01.834
Oh, I see.

36:02.917 --> 36:04.625
What exactly did you say?

36:04.625 --> 36:07.959
I told her,
her birth mother may
still be alive

36:07.959 --> 36:09.625
that we have a name,
but other than that

36:09.625 --> 36:11.208
we don't know much.

36:11.208 --> 36:13.000
-So, you told her everything.
-Mmm-hmm.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.125
-How exactly did she take it?
-She's fine.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.041
Ted, I know this isn't
what you wanted

36:18.041 --> 36:22.042
but I just don't want
secrets in our family.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.917
Of course.

36:24.917 --> 36:27.708
I also promised Sutton
I'd help her find
her birth mother.

36:28.125 --> 36:29.417
Honey...

36:30.458 --> 36:32.125
If it's
that important to you...

36:33.959 --> 36:35.291
I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.750
What did I say
about coming
to my place of work?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.917
I know, and I'm sorry,
but I had to talk to you.

36:55.042 --> 36:57.875
I've got new info,
something big.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.000
It's about Annie.

36:59.708 --> 37:01.250
Fine, what is it?

37:01.250 --> 37:04.959
Okay, so this is
the part you're not going
to like.

37:04.959 --> 37:07.000
But if you want me
to tell you what I know,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
you've got to let me get
back together with Char.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.291
You're kidding me.

37:10.291 --> 37:11.625
No, sir, I'm not.

37:11.625 --> 37:13.500
Are you trying to blackmail
me, Derek? 'Cause...

37:13.500 --> 37:15.750
Please don't think
it's because I don't
respect you

37:15.750 --> 37:17.125
because I do.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.625
It's just...

37:19.333 --> 37:21.250
Char's very important to me.

37:21.250 --> 37:24.041
What if I decided to reinstate
those possession charges?

37:24.917 --> 37:26.125
Then I'd rather go to jail.

37:26.125 --> 37:27.250
Go to jail, right.

37:28.625 --> 37:30.042
Do we have a deal or not?

37:35.167 --> 37:36.875
[cell phone ringing]

37:38.167 --> 37:40.834
-Hello?
-Hey, Emma, it's Troy.

37:40.834 --> 37:42.417
From the Dowinger clinic.

37:42.417 --> 37:45.417
I snaked your number
from Dr. Hughes' office.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.542
Uh, why are you calling me?

37:48.542 --> 37:50.333
Well, I kind of thought
you'd want to know

37:50.333 --> 37:52.208
your biological mom escaped.

37:52.208 --> 37:55.083
-What? When?
-Couple nights ago.

37:55.083 --> 37:57.959
And you have no idea
where she is
or where she was going?

37:57.959 --> 37:59.959
I'd say it's a safe bet...

37:59.959 --> 38:01.209
She's coming to look for you.

38:02.375 --> 38:03.959
Okay, thanks.

38:05.667 --> 38:09.083
Hey. Well, this has turned out
to be a very interesting day.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.333
Uh, what's going on?

38:12.333 --> 38:14.000
Three guys have asked me out
from that party

38:14.000 --> 38:15.875
last night and it's not
even lunch yet.

38:15.875 --> 38:17.125
That's great.

38:17.125 --> 38:20.125
I mean, it's flattering,
but I kind of like
Randy the best.

38:20.708 --> 38:22.750
-Randy...
-Hot-jacket guy.

38:22.750 --> 38:24.750
He told me
about a really great party
next weekend

38:24.750 --> 38:26.125
so, we should go.

38:26.125 --> 38:28.125
That sounds so fun.

38:28.125 --> 38:31.209
But I just found out
something about my mom

38:31.209 --> 38:33.208
and I have to leave.

38:33.750 --> 38:34.959
Right.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.125
To California?

38:37.125 --> 38:38.583
Actually, Phoenix.

38:40.291 --> 38:42.708
I bet it'll be nice
to be back to your old life,

38:42.708 --> 38:45.458
see all your fancy friends,
sleep in your own bed.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.041
That will be nice.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.750
Not that it's my life.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.417
Obviously. But...

38:54.000 --> 38:56.167
Come on.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.250
Does she really think you were
pulling this off, Sutton?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.333
[Kristin] Sutton,
did you write us a letter?

39:06.708 --> 39:08.250
No, why?

39:08.250 --> 39:09.708
Well, it looks
like your handwriting.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.625
It's addressed
to your dad and me.

39:13.708 --> 39:16.291
-Mom, stop!
-What?

39:18.084 --> 39:20.125
Uh, I forgot.

39:20.125 --> 39:24.542
I... I did write
this letter when I was upset

39:24.542 --> 39:26.125
when I knew
you and dad weren't

39:26.125 --> 39:30.333
telling me the truth about,
um, you know.

39:30.333 --> 39:34.208
So I'm guessing
the letter says things you're
no longer feeling?

39:34.208 --> 39:37.750
No, it's stuff I didn't mean.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.792
Why don't you tear it up?

39:53.250 --> 39:55.667
Okay, I'm gonna go.

39:55.667 --> 39:58.542
Wait, Justin.
It's still early.

39:58.542 --> 40:01.917
Do you want to come inside
and watch a movie
or something?

40:01.917 --> 40:05.042
Yeah, that might not be
such a great idea.

40:05.042 --> 40:08.125
I just think, you know,
considering the recent events

40:08.125 --> 40:09.917
-maybe we should...
-No, babe, it's okay.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.042
I had a great talk
with my mom.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.792
We have this whole, you know,
new "honesty policy" thing

40:14.792 --> 40:17.041
and, um, I think
it's gonna work out great.

40:17.041 --> 40:20.917
Actually, it's not your mom
that I'm worried about.

40:20.917 --> 40:22.125
Then who?

40:22.125 --> 40:23.375
My dad?

40:24.083 --> 40:26.000
Sweet, goofy, Dr. Ted Mercer?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.500
The man who actually teared up

40:27.500 --> 40:29.083
watching that Justin Bieber
documentary?

40:29.083 --> 40:31.042
I wasn't even gonna
say anything

40:31.042 --> 40:32.750
and maybe I'm wrong.

40:33.250 --> 40:34.834
But I just...

40:36.000 --> 40:37.209
Laurel...

40:38.000 --> 40:40.834
I'm starting to think
that your dad is not

40:40.834 --> 40:42.708
as great a guy
as everyone thinks.

40:45.959 --> 40:48.167
[announcements over PA]

40:48.167 --> 40:49.750
So, you never thought
I was Emma,

40:49.750 --> 40:52.084
-not even for, like, a second?
-[chuckles]

40:52.084 --> 40:53.625
-No.
-How did you figure it out?

40:53.625 --> 40:55.209
When did you figure it out?

40:55.209 --> 40:58.041
Honestly,
the second that you got
into my car.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.500
Dude, come on.
Emma's my best friend.

41:02.291 --> 41:04.625
So, you think
you guys are gonna
patch things up

41:04.625 --> 41:06.250
when you get back to Phoenix?

41:06.834 --> 41:08.500
Maybe.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.125
I mean, the girl did
steal my boyfriend.

41:11.125 --> 41:12.708
That doesn't sound
like the Emma I know.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.333
All she could talk about
before she left was

41:16.333 --> 41:18.250
how excited she was
to meet you.

41:18.250 --> 41:20.500
Yeah, well, it doesn't
really excuse
what she's done.

41:22.333 --> 41:24.000
Although,
after pretending to be her

41:24.000 --> 41:25.959
for these last couple of days,

41:25.959 --> 41:29.333
I'm starting to regret
sending this letter.

41:30.542 --> 41:32.792
It could really get
her in trouble.

41:32.792 --> 41:35.167
Well, maybe you should
go back there
and make things right.

41:35.167 --> 41:36.125
Maybe.

41:37.708 --> 41:40.542
Anyway, thank you,
Lexi, for everything.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.667
Right back at you.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.250
-One for the road?
-Sure.

41:49.417 --> 41:52.208
Well, if you're
ever back in Vegas...

41:52.208 --> 41:53.667
Definitely.

41:58.500 --> 42:00.209
♪ Runnin' through my head ♪

42:00.209 --> 42:01.333
Bye.

42:01.333 --> 42:02.583
See ya.

42:05.917 --> 42:08.167
[Sutton]  "Hey, Mom and Dad...

42:08.167 --> 42:11.583
"You should know
that the girl living
in my room right now

42:11.583 --> 42:14.583
"and calling herself
Sutton isn't me.

42:14.583 --> 42:16.667
"She's stolen my identity,

42:17.208 --> 42:20.000
"my family, and friends

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
"and I'm now afraid

42:23.000 --> 42:25.959
"of how far she'll go
to keep me from taking
my life back."

42:27.417 --> 42:29.291
And it just gets worse.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.000
At least you intercepted
the letter.

42:34.125 --> 42:35.333
Are you kidding?

42:35.333 --> 42:38.000
Ethan, I have to leave
Phoenix as soon as possible.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.208
How could I be
so stupid to think that

42:46.250 --> 42:47.834
everything would
work out here?

42:51.333 --> 42:53.291
You know what sucks?

42:53.291 --> 42:55.291
I have to say
goodbye to everybody.

42:57.125 --> 42:58.542
And this place.

43:03.291 --> 43:04.375
You.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.042
Maybe not me.

43:09.125 --> 43:10.875
What do you mean?

43:10.875 --> 43:15.000
I mean, wherever you go,
Emma, I'm coming with you.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.167
♪ Tell me what to see ♪

43:17.167 --> 43:20.375
♪ Come away with me ♪
