WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.100
- HEY, DEBRA,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

00:03.967 --> 00:05.733
TOMORROW,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

00:05.733 --> 00:08.567
IS AMY'S AND MY
THREE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

00:08.567 --> 00:12.167
- OH! WHAT TIME'S THE PARADE?

00:12.167 --> 00:16.333
- AND WE WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE YOU-- DEBRA--

00:16.333 --> 00:20.033
OVER TO CELEBRATE,
AND YOU CAN BRING SOMEBODY.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.167
- OH, THAT'S SWEET.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.600
- CAN'T MAKE IT.
- WE'LL BE THERE.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.767
- NOPE.
- YUP.

00:25.767 --> 00:27.433
DO THE LAUNDRY.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.433
- HOW 'BOUT I SHRINK
YOUR UNDERWEAR

00:31.433 --> 00:33.633
AND MAKE YOU THINK
YOUR BUTT'S GOING FAT?

00:39.733 --> 00:42.100
- TROUBLE IN PARADISE?

00:42.100 --> 00:46.033
- NO, JUST WEDNESDAY
IN PARADISE.

00:46.033 --> 00:48.867
- CARE FOR SOME ADVICE?

00:48.867 --> 00:51.600
- NO.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.300
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'VE FOUND

00:53.300 --> 00:55.667
TO BE THE KEY
TO A HAPPY MARRIAGE.

00:55.667 --> 00:58.333
- SAYS THE MAN
WHO MARRIED A STRIPPER,

00:58.333 --> 01:00.000
THEN DIVORCED A STRIPPER,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.667
THEN MARRIED
A REGULAR PERSON

01:01.667 --> 01:06.600
AND--AND HUNG IN THERE
A WHOLE THREE MONTHS.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.700
- WANT A HAPPY MARRIAGE?

01:08.700 --> 01:10.333
HOLD HANDS.

01:10.333 --> 01:14.467
- HOLD HANDS?
- HOLD HANDS.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.533
- YOU'RE A STUPID PERSON.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.133
- I'M SERIOUS.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.600
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE
AS HOLDING HANDS

01:21.600 --> 01:24.700
COULD GIVE SOMEONE
A SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.167
- STOP IT!

01:31.500 --> 01:33.700
- YOU ARE SO AFRAID
OF AFFECTION.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.300
- YOU DON'T TOUCH ME.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.767
- RAYMOND, RAYMOND, RAYMOND,

01:37.767 --> 01:39.333
YOU'RE SO CLOSED OFF.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.033
HOLDING YOUR WIFE'S HAND
COULD BE PLEASURABLE FOR YOU,

01:42.033 --> 01:43.533
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

01:43.533 --> 01:48.333
IT MIGHT ALLOW HER TO FEEL
WANTED AND LOVED BY YOU.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.600
- HOW DOES THAT
GET ME OUT OF LAUNDRY?

01:52.600 --> 01:55.033
- IF YOU COULD CONNECT
WITH YOUR WIFE EMOTIONALLY,

01:55.033 --> 01:58.067
THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T
SEE DOING LAUNDRY AS A CHORE.

01:58.067 --> 01:59.533
YOU MIGHT DO IT WILLINGLY,

01:59.533 --> 02:03.733
FOR HER,
AS A GESTURE OF LOVE.

02:06.100 --> 02:09.767
- YOU ARE AN IDIOT
WRAPPED IN A MORON.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.233
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M WRAPPED IN--

02:15.233 --> 02:17.633
A GOOD AND HEALTHY MARRIAGE.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.100
- YEAH, WELL,
WRAP IT UP TO GO.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.200
- YEAH, WELL, FINE.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.233
I FOUND
SOMETHING THAT WORKS,

02:22.233 --> 02:23.833
I'M TRYING TO PASS IT ON,

02:23.833 --> 02:27.433
BUT, HEY, IF YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE...

02:33.067 --> 02:34.800
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

02:34.800 --> 02:37.533
- YOU'RE A BOOB.

02:57.533 --> 03:01.433
- I'M SORRY, RAY.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

03:01.433 --> 03:04.867
- I JUST--JUST WANT
TO HOLD YOUR HAND.

03:04.867 --> 03:07.167
- WHY?

03:07.167 --> 03:08.867
- I GOT TO HAVE A REASON?

03:08.867 --> 03:11.367
I WANTED TO HOLD YOUR HAND,
SO I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND.

03:11.367 --> 03:13.500
- OH.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.700
OKAY.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.533
I NEED TO TURN THE PAGE.

03:36.100 --> 03:39.700
- STUPID ROBERT.
- WHAT?

03:39.700 --> 03:42.667
- HE GAVE ME ADVICE:
"HOLD HANDS."

03:42.667 --> 03:45.200
OKAY, SO I TRIED.
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIKE IT.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.433
STUPID ROBERT.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.800
- ROBERT GAVE YOU ADVICE?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.767
- YEAH, MARRIAGE ADVICE...

03:50.767 --> 03:51.967
TO ME...

03:51.967 --> 03:54.067
ABOUT MARRIAGE...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.400
ADVICE...

03:55.400 --> 03:58.867
TO ME.

03:58.867 --> 04:01.867
- SO THAT WAS ROBERT'S ADVICE
YOU WERE TRYING?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.633
- YEAH, YEAH, "HOLD HANDS."

04:03.633 --> 04:06.067
HE'S MARRIED THREE MONTHS;
HE'S ON THE LECTURE CIRCUIT.

04:07.567 --> 04:11.133
- SO YOU WERE TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING FOR OUR MARRIAGE?

04:11.133 --> 04:12.600
- YUP.
YOU KNOW WHAT,

04:12.600 --> 04:13.833
I'M GONNA CALL HIM
AND TELL HIM HOW IT WENT.

04:13.833 --> 04:15.100
- NO, NO, NO.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.233
LISTEN,
I-I DIDN'T REALIZE.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.767
COME ON.
LET'S TRY AGAIN.

04:19.767 --> 04:20.833
- WHAT?

04:20.833 --> 04:23.033
- YEAH, COME ON.
WHY NOT?

04:28.367 --> 04:30.933
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING
TO HAVE SEX OR SOMETHING,

04:30.933 --> 04:32.633
BUT THIS IS NICE.

04:34.867 --> 04:38.300
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.733
- YEAH, AND THIS
I CAN DO A LONG TIME.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.100
JUST, UH, ONE THING.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.600
WOULD YOU MIND
NOT SCRUNCHING IT?

04:54.600 --> 04:55.900
- WHAT?

04:55.900 --> 04:57.400
- YEAH, I FORGOT.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.033
YOU HAVE THIS WAY OF, LIKE,
LINING UP MY KNUCKLES

04:59.033 --> 05:00.800
AND KINDA GRINDING THEM.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.700
- OH. SORRY.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.967
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.800
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY I DON'T HOLD HANDS MORE.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.333
- THAT'S NOT WHY.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.233
- YES, YES, IT IS.
THAT'S WHY--

05:11.233 --> 05:14.333
THE TERRIBLE PAIN.

05:15.567 --> 05:18.100
- WELL, I MEAN,
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.200
YOUR HAND'S
JUST LAYING THERE.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.200
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"JUST LAYING THERE"?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.367
- WELL, THIS IS NOT
HOLDING HANDS.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.367
THIS IS LAYING IT ON THERE.

05:26.367 --> 05:30.033
- MAYBE MY HAND'S AFRAID OF YOU,
SO IT'S PLAYING DEAD.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.800
- WELL, IF ANYTHING,
I'M TRYING TO GIVE IT CPR,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.500
MR. CADAVER HAND.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.700
- ALL RIGHT, SEE? SEE?
I KNEW THIS WOULDN'T WORK.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.133
THERE'S NO POINT
IN DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

05:39.133 --> 05:40.433
YOU KNOW WHY?

05:40.433 --> 05:42.800
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY LIKE
BEING MAD AT ME.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.033
- WHAT?
- YES, YOU DO.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.367
IT'S FUN FOR YOU
OR SOMETHING.

05:46.367 --> 05:47.700
YOU ACTUALLY
PREFER IT THAT WAY.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.000
- OH, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!
- SEE?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.767
YOU'RE MAD,
JUST LIKE YOU LIKE.

05:52.767 --> 05:56.433
- RAY, IF I'M MAD,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I ENJOY IT.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.633
- WELL, WHY, THEN?
- BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME

05:58.633 --> 06:00.600
IN TEN YEARS, YOU HOLD MY HAND,
BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE

06:00.600 --> 06:02.100
YOU WANT TO PROVE
YOUR BROTHER WRONG,

06:02.100 --> 06:03.800
AND THEN YOU SAY
I'M GRINDING IT UP

06:03.800 --> 06:06.100
BECAUSE I ENJOY
BEING MAD.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.533
OKAY.
FORGET IT. FORGET IT.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.733
EVERYTHING IS FINE,
AND YOU ARE PERFECT.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.433
WHO'S ROBERT
TO GIVE YOU ADVICE?

06:13.433 --> 06:16.700
YOU DON'T NEED ADVICE
FROM ANYBODY.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.200
- DEB...
- I SAID FORGET IT.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.167
- NO, LOOK.
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

06:28.167 --> 06:29.367
THAT WASN'T
THE ONLY REASON I DID IT,

06:29.367 --> 06:31.100
JUST TO PROVE ROBERT WRONG.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.767
I-I ALSO DID IT...

06:33.767 --> 06:36.300
TO HELP OUR MARRIAGE.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.800
OKAY? 'CAUSE WE--WE HAVE
A GOOD, HEALTHY MARRIAGE

06:39.800 --> 06:43.733
THAT I'M VERY MUCH INTO.

06:43.733 --> 06:45.333
VERY MUCH.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.733
- YOU CAN STOP NOW.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.667
- OH, COME ON.

06:49.667 --> 06:50.933
COME ON.

06:50.933 --> 06:55.567
YOU KNOW YOU STILL LOVE
MR. CADAVER MCFLOPPYHAND.

06:55.567 --> 06:56.800
- STOP IT.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.900
- COME ON.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.500
COME ON.
HOLD MY FLIPPER.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.133
- DO YOU CARE ABOUT ME
AT ALL?

07:04.133 --> 07:05.900
- WHAT? YES,
OF COURSE I CARE ABOUT YOU.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.733
IT'S ROBERT, OKAY?

07:07.733 --> 07:09.333
I DON'T NEED ROBERT
SEEING YOU LIKE THIS TOMORROW

07:09.333 --> 07:11.333
AT HIS--
AT HIS THREE-MONTH JUBILEE

07:11.333 --> 07:14.267
GOING,
"TROUBLE IN PARADISE?"

07:14.267 --> 07:15.800
- NO, THIS IS NOT
ROBERT'S FAULT.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.433
THIS IS YOUR FAULT,

07:17.433 --> 07:19.400
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.867
IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY.

07:20.867 --> 07:22.733
- NO, STOP, WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME SAY ONE THING.

07:22.733 --> 07:26.900
OKAY, JUST, COULD WE MAKE UP
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT?

07:26.900 --> 07:29.000
- WHY?

07:29.000 --> 07:33.533
- BECAUSE ROBERT THINKS HE HAS
A BETTER MARRIAGE THAN ME.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.267
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
WORK ON YOUR MARRIAGE?

07:36.267 --> 07:38.100
- OKAY, BUT THIS THING
IS TOMORROW NIGHT,

07:38.100 --> 07:41.867
AND I'M GOLFING
IN THE MORNING, SO JUST...

07:41.867 --> 07:43.600
LOOK...

07:43.600 --> 07:45.367
PLEASE...

07:45.367 --> 07:46.700
FOR NOW, JUST FOR NOW,

07:46.700 --> 07:49.733
COULD WE JUST PRETEND
THAT WE MADE UP?

07:49.733 --> 07:52.367
YOU KNOW,
MY MOTHER'S GONNA BE THERE.

07:52.367 --> 07:54.233
- SO?

07:54.233 --> 07:57.533
- SO...
COMPARING YOU TO AMY,

07:57.533 --> 08:01.967
COMPARING YOUR MARRIAGE
TO AMY'S MARRIAGE,

08:01.967 --> 08:06.200
COMPARING THE NEW WIFE
TO THE...

08:06.200 --> 08:10.133
YOUR MARRIAGE.

08:10.133 --> 08:14.300
DOING A WIFE-TO-WIFE
COMPARISON.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.633
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.033
- YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

08:41.167 --> 08:45.667
- FEELS PERFECTLY FINE.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.500
WE DON'T NEED HER.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.433
DEB, LISTEN.

08:56.433 --> 09:00.000
LOOK, I KNOW--
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND--

09:00.000 --> 09:03.233
WHATEVER. I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT, OKAY?

09:03.233 --> 09:04.400
I SCREWED UP.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.133
I JUST--
IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT,

09:06.133 --> 09:09.333
AND YOU WERE RIGHT TO FEEL
WHATEVER YOU FEEL.

09:09.333 --> 09:14.167
AND JUST I'M SORRY, HONEY.
I LOVE YOU.

09:14.167 --> 09:15.700
- NICE TRY.

09:17.967 --> 09:21.067
[doorbell rings]

09:21.067 --> 09:24.200
- HEY.
COME ON IN.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.567
- HEY.
HI, HEY, WE'RE HERE.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.800
HOW WE DOING, POOPS?
- STOP IT.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.400
- OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
YOUR JACKET?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.200
- NO.
- YOUR HAIR LOOKS NICE.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.567
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

09:34.567 --> 09:37.667
- HI. WE'RE ALMOST READY.
- OH, GREAT.

09:37.667 --> 09:40.333
- YOU TWO ARE LATE.
PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.133
- SORRY.
IT'S KIND OF HARD

09:42.133 --> 09:43.900
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE,
YOU KNOW, THE KIDS.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.433
- BECAUSE OF THAT BABYSITTER,
ISN'T IT?

09:46.433 --> 09:49.267
I MEAN, THE ONE WHO WEARS
THOSE ROCK AND ROLL T-SHIRTS.

09:49.267 --> 09:52.733
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HER.

09:52.733 --> 09:56.267
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.067
- CAN I GIVE YOU
A HAND THERE, LITTLE LADY?

09:59.067 --> 10:00.433
- OH.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.033
- SHE HAS ONE OF THOSE
"KISS THE COOK" APRONS,

10:02.033 --> 10:04.233
BUT SHE DOESN'T NEED IT.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.867
- OH, THAT WAS SO SWEET:

10:32.867 --> 10:36.700
YOU TWO CELEBRATING
YOUR ANNIVERSARY LIKE THIS.

10:38.067 --> 10:41.400
WE USED TO BE HAPPY.
REMEMBER, FRANK?

10:41.400 --> 10:45.733
- THEN THE METEOR HIT
AND KILLED ALL THE DINOSAURS.

10:48.533 --> 10:51.267
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.100
- AHEM. HELLO.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.500
- OH, EXCUSE ME.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.100
I WAS JUST GETTING
A LITTLE DESSERT.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.667
- [giggling]
ROBERT.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.533
- I CAN'T HELP IT!

11:10.233 --> 11:13.600
- OH, THIS IS EXCITING.
THREE MONTHS!

11:13.600 --> 11:17.600
- I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE SILLY
TO CELEBRATE THREE MONTHS.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.633
- NO, NO, IT'S WONDERFUL.
ENJOY IT. IT'S NICE.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.800
- WELL, YOU KNOW HOW HARD
IT'S BEEN GETTING HERE,

11:24.800 --> 11:29.500
AND THE WEDDING
WAS A LITTLE BUMPY, BUT...

11:29.500 --> 11:31.367
IT'S BEEN
EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.733
- AWW.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.933
- YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

11:34.933 --> 11:36.333
- WHAT DID I DO?

11:36.333 --> 11:38.567
- YOU INTRODUCED ME
TO ROBERT.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.033
AND THEN YOU HELPED ME
GET OVER HIM

11:40.033 --> 11:41.533
AND GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH HIM,

11:41.533 --> 11:43.500
GET OVER HIM AGAIN,
AND THEN MARRY HIM.

11:45.433 --> 11:46.867
AND SO NOW
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

11:46.867 --> 11:48.900
- WITH WHAT?

11:48.900 --> 11:51.933
- YOUR MARRIAGE.

11:51.933 --> 11:55.100
HERE.
I READ THIS GREAT BOOK.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.467
I THOUGHT OF YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

11:56.467 --> 12:01.367
- "MARRIAGE
IS AN AMUSEMENT PARK."

12:01.367 --> 12:03.000
- ISN'T THAT A GOOD ANALOGY?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.667
- OH, WELL,
I THINK I GET IT--

12:05.667 --> 12:07.700
THE UPS AND DOWNS,
LIKE A ROLLER COASTER.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.800
- YEAH.
BUT THAT'S JUST ONE CHAPTER.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.967
THERE'S "HAUNTED HOUSE,"
"THE HALL OF MIRRORS,"

12:12.967 --> 12:15.133
"RIDE MAINTENANCE."

12:16.767 --> 12:20.533
- HOW ABOUT THE RIDES
THAT MAKE YOU THROW UP?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.300
- THAT'S GREAT.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.233
BUT THEY'RE ALL IN HERE,
AND THE POINT IS...

12:26.233 --> 12:28.300
YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE
ALL THE ATTRACTIONS,

12:28.300 --> 12:31.300
BUT YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT
THE WHOLE PARK.

12:36.467 --> 12:38.367
THIS IS THE COUPLE
THAT WROTE IT.

12:38.367 --> 12:40.867
THEY'RE BOTH LICENSED
CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS,

12:40.867 --> 12:44.067
BUT THEY'RE FUNNY TOO.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.333
- YEAH, THEY LOOK FUNNY.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.100
- YEAH, THEY'RE FUNNY...

12:49.100 --> 12:51.200
BUT THEY CAN HELP.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.667
- WELL, GREAT.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.267
THANKS.

12:57.267 --> 13:00.467
OOH, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS. THANKS.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.800
OKAY, WELL,
I'M JUST GONNA GO...

13:02.800 --> 13:04.767
OUT THERE.

13:08.033 --> 13:10.233
- IN THOSE DAYS,
IT ONLY COST 50 CENTS

13:10.233 --> 13:11.533
TO SEE A MOVIE.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.300
- AND YOU GOT TWO MOVIES,
A NEWSREEL,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.633
AND A STAGE SHOW.

13:14.633 --> 13:18.367
YOUR MOTHER HAD TO KEEP IT SHUT
FOR FIVE HOURS.

13:18.367 --> 13:21.133
- AND YOU REMEMBER,
THEY USED TO GIVE YOU PLATES?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.233
YOU COULD MAKE
A WHOLE SET.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.733
REMEMBER WE GOT
THE GREEN ONES.

13:23.733 --> 13:25.433
WE DIDN'T LIKE 'EM,
WE BROUGHT THEM BACK?

13:25.433 --> 13:27.633
- YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT I GOT IN THE KITCHEN.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.167
- WHAT?

13:29.167 --> 13:31.367
- MARRIAGE ADVICE FROM AMY.

13:31.367 --> 13:36.767
- WELL, UNLESS THE ADVICE
WAS MORE SEX, HOW DARE SHE?

13:36.767 --> 13:40.500
- SHE GAVE ME THIS BOOK
BECAUSE SHE THINKS I NEED IT.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.367
- WHO ARE THESE TWO IDIOTS?

13:42.367 --> 13:43.833
- CAN YOU BELIEVE AMY?

13:43.833 --> 13:46.300
I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN MARRIED
FOR THREE MONTHS.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.467
SHE PROBABLY
STILL SHAVES HER LEGS.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.700
- [scoffs]

13:52.667 --> 13:54.200
- GIVING YOU ADVICE.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.400
- I KNOW!

13:55.400 --> 13:56.633
- DON'T YOU THINK IT'S COOL

13:56.633 --> 13:58.133
HOW I'M NOT
RUBBING YOUR FACE

13:58.133 --> 14:00.367
IN HOW OBVIOUSLY WRONG
YOU WERE?

14:00.367 --> 14:01.800
- DINNER IS SERVED.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.233
OKAY, LET'S ALL SIT DOWN.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.000
- OH, DOESN'T THAT
LOOK NICE, AMY.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.200
- OH, THANKS.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.733
- ONE CHICKEN?

14:13.067 --> 14:15.033
- THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING.

14:15.033 --> 14:18.500
NOW I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE A TOAST...

14:18.500 --> 14:20.067
TO MY BRIDE.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.667
- AWW.

14:22.667 --> 14:26.067
- 90 DAYS--
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SHARED.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.433
90 DAYS,

14:27.433 --> 14:32.067
THE USUAL SENTENCE
FOR VAGRANCY.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.467
BUT I NEVER KNEW

14:33.467 --> 14:36.533
THAT SUCH A SHORT TIME
COULD BE SO FULL OF JOY.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.400
- OH, ROBERT.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.567
- AND YET THE TIME
HAS ALSO GONE SO QUICKLY.

14:43.567 --> 14:46.400
90 DAYS.

14:46.400 --> 14:50.700
- YEAH, HOW MANY DAYS
IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

14:50.700 --> 14:51.633
- RAYMOND.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.233
NO, NO,
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.267
I DON'T WANT TO GET
OVERLY SENTIMENTAL.

14:55.267 --> 14:57.400
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I THINK WE ALL KNOW

14:57.400 --> 15:00.267
HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND
TRUE LOVE IN THIS WORLD,

15:00.267 --> 15:02.033
AND I THINK THAT I...

15:02.033 --> 15:04.300
WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.167
SO, AMY, NO MATTER
HOW LONG WE'RE TOGETHER,

15:07.167 --> 15:09.633
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE...

15:09.633 --> 15:11.600
FOREVER MY LOVE.

15:15.333 --> 15:19.500
- PASS THE BEANS, WILL YA?
- YEAH, HERE.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.400
- I GUESS I SHOULD REALLY

15:23.400 --> 15:24.833
SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT MY HUSBAND NOW.

15:24.833 --> 15:25.933
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

15:25.933 --> 15:28.467
- FOR THE LOVE OF JOE.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.800
- WHAT?

15:34.800 --> 15:37.567
- NO, NOTHING.
IT'S FINE. GO RIGHT AHEAD.

15:37.567 --> 15:40.233
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:40.233 --> 15:42.100
- IT'S JUST THAT YOU TWO

15:42.100 --> 15:43.700
ARE POURING IT ON
A LITTLE THICK,

15:43.700 --> 15:45.267
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:45.267 --> 15:46.467
- IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

15:46.467 --> 15:50.067
- IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.600
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
I SPENT THREE MONTHS

15:51.600 --> 15:56.067
JUST WAITING FOR HIM
TO COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.400
- I SPENT TEN MONTHS

16:00.400 --> 16:01.767
JUST WAITING
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS

16:01.767 --> 16:04.600
YELLING, "COME ON.
YOUR HAIR LOOKS FINE."

16:04.600 --> 16:07.233
- I'VE HAD 3 1/2 YEARS
OF HIM JUST BURPING.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.567
- I'M BURPING YOUR FOOD.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.100
- YEAH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
POISON YOURS.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.267
- MAYBE THAT'D
GIVE IT SOME FLAVOR.

16:11.267 --> 16:12.933
- HEY, YOU LISTEN HERE--
- HOLD IT.

16:12.933 --> 16:14.033
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

16:14.033 --> 16:16.667
- YES, THIS IS UNSEEMLY.

16:26.433 --> 16:27.800
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.033
DID WE OFFEND YOU
SOMEHOW?

16:30.033 --> 16:32.133
- I THINK
I CAN EXPLAIN, AMY.

16:32.133 --> 16:35.100
YOU SEE, THEY'RE JEALOUS.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.167
- WHAT? WHY?

16:37.167 --> 16:39.367
- BECAUSE WE...ARE HAPPY.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.200
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.767
- YEAH, AND DON'T GIVE US
ANY MORE BOOKS

16:42.767 --> 16:47.100
LIKE "MARRIAGE IS A CIRCUS.
EMBRACE YOUR CLOWN."

16:47.100 --> 16:49.667
- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU WITH THAT.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.000
- WHAT BOOK?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.533
- IT'S A MARRIAGE GUIDE.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.700
IN FACT, MARIE,
I GOT YOU AND FRANK ONE.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.267
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.300
WHY WOULD YOU GET US
A MARRIAGE BOOK?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.467
- YEAH, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THAT SUBJECT.

17:19.167 --> 17:23.033
- I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT FIND IT USEFUL.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.933
- YOU'RE GIVING US
ADVICE ABOUT MARRIAGE?

17:32.933 --> 17:35.600
- THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, MA.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.067
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

17:38.067 --> 17:41.767
- THESE MAY NOT BE
THE PEOPLE TO HELP.

17:43.967 --> 17:45.767
- I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY.

17:45.767 --> 17:49.100
I GUESS I JUST DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.100
- AMY, OUR MARRIAGE IS FINE.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.633
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S
A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS OF YOU

17:52.633 --> 17:54.033
TO THINK THAT YOURS
IS BETTER?

17:54.033 --> 17:56.533
- HIGHLY PRESUMPTUOUS.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.333
- I NEVER SAID
IT WAS BETTER.

18:01.333 --> 18:04.333
IT'S JUST, YOU CAN'T HELP
NOTICING THINGS.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.867
- LIKE ALL THE YELLING.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.833
- OH, WHAT? SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT GONNA YELL?

18:08.833 --> 18:11.233
- AMY, THERE'S GONNA BE
SCREAMS COMIN' OUT OF YOU,

18:11.233 --> 18:15.467
AND THEY WON'T BE BECAUSE
YOU'RE ON MR. TOAD'S WILD RIDE.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.200
- THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT, ROBERT.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.267
- HEY, LOOK, DON'T TALK
ABOUT US, ALL RIGHT?

18:28.267 --> 18:29.567
WORRY ABOUT
YOURSELF, HUH?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.233
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
GO HOLD HANDS?

18:31.233 --> 18:32.700
- YEAH,
OVER EACH OTHER'S MOUTHS.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.133
- [laughs]

18:34.133 --> 18:37.600
YEAH, YEAH.
GOOD ONE.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.633
- YOU TRY
TO HELP PEOPLE...

18:39.633 --> 18:40.467
- WELL, WHO ASKED YOU?

18:40.467 --> 18:41.900
- JEALOUS!
- YOU JERK.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.567
- BAD HUSBAND!
- YOU BIG BOOB!

18:43.567 --> 18:44.667
- WHOA! WHOA!

18:44.667 --> 18:46.867
- NOT TODAY, MAN!
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!

18:46.867 --> 18:48.600
- MAKE IT TODAY!
- THEY'RE OVER!

18:48.600 --> 18:50.033
- LET'S MAKE IT TODAY.
- THEY'RE OVER, BUDDY.

18:50.033 --> 18:55.833
- STOP IT!

18:55.833 --> 18:57.767
STOP IT!

18:57.767 --> 18:59.167
NOW SIT DOWN.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.967
- [whispering]

19:02.967 --> 19:04.533
- SIT DOWN.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.433
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

19:08.433 --> 19:09.967
MAYBE YOU COULD ALL
USE SOME ADVICE

19:09.967 --> 19:12.300
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S
IN A POSITION TO GIVE IT.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.600
- SEE WHAT YOU DID, AMY?

19:16.767 --> 19:19.200
- YOU THINK WE HAVE
NOTHING TO OFFER?

19:19.200 --> 19:22.467
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
46 YEARS.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.833
WE'VE SEEN THE LOWS,
AND WE'VE SEEN THE HIGHS.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.533
- WHAT DAY WAS THE HIGH?

19:35.800 --> 19:39.200
- YOU TWO--YOU'RE NEWLYWEDS.
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.467
GOD BLESS YOU,
YOU KNOW NOTHING.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.033
AND YOU TWO,
YOU'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING,

19:45.033 --> 19:46.933
AND THE REASON
YOU GET SO UPSET

19:46.933 --> 19:49.233
IS BECAUSE YOU THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT.

19:49.233 --> 19:50.600
LOOK AT US.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.467
THIS IS EXPERIENCE.
THIS IS WISDOM.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.300
- THIS IS JUICY.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.200
- YOU WANT SOME REAL
MARRIAGE ADVICE?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE SECRET NOW.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.933
THERE'S GONNA BE YELLING.

20:07.933 --> 20:10.333
THERE'S GONNA BE ANGER.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.300
DON'T FIGHT IT.
ACCEPT IT.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.200
YOU LOVE HIM.
YOU HATE HIM.

20:15.200 --> 20:19.267
HE DISGUSTS YOU.
LOOK HOW HE EATS.

20:19.267 --> 20:24.333
YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN,
AND YOU PLOW THROUGH.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.467
- AMEN.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.633
- BUT, MARIE,
YOU SAID "HATE."

20:34.633 --> 20:38.167
HOW CAN HATE HAVE ANY PLACE
IN A MARRIAGE?

20:38.167 --> 20:41.333
- YOU MAKE ROOM.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.167
THERE'S GONNA BE HATE.
HATE IS REAL.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.333
MARRIAGE IS REAL.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.333
WE MIGHT FIGHT, BUT...

20:48.333 --> 20:50.700
WE'RE OKAY WITH EACH OTHER.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.067
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?
WE'VE ENDURED.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.433
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT ALL,

20:55.433 --> 20:58.233
AND NOW...

20:58.233 --> 21:00.700
- WE'RE WAITING FOR DEATH.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.167
- NOT THAT WE'RE IN A RUSH.

21:11.167 --> 21:12.300
- FAIR ENOUGH.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.333
- THAT'S A MARRIAGE.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
- TO ROBERT AND AMY.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.500
- TO RAY AND DEBRA.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.100
- TO MARRIAGE.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.300
- TILL DEATH DO US PART.
