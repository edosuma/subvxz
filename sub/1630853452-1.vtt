00:19.300 --> 00:25.000
(mysterious music)

00:35.533 --> 00:38.366
(laughing)

00:44.600 --> 00:46.533
- Can't believe it,

00:46.600 --> 00:49.200
I don't get here enough and now it's raining.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.633
- Uh, we don't get out anywhere. (laughs)

00:51.666 --> 00:54.300
- With our schedules, how can we?

00:54.766 --> 00:56.666
(chuckles)

01:02.100 --> 01:06.033
- Ooh, it's a long way down. - It is.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.866
So, how long are we supposed to stand here in the rain.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.400
- Until a feeling of calm washes over us.

01:22.433 --> 01:24.400
(laughter)

01:26.766 --> 01:28.700
(sighs)

01:28.733 --> 01:33.233
Girls! Come one, I want you to see this view.

01:37.733 --> 01:40.266
(footsteps approaching) (both): Ah!

02:00.933 --> 02:02.633
(sighs)

02:06.333 --> 02:07.933
- Ugh.

02:09.666 --> 02:11.600
- Don't look so happy.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.933
- Tell me, what do I have to be happy about?

02:13.966 --> 02:17.266
- Ugh, come on Lily, it's high school, not death row.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.800
- It might as well be.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.900
- Listen to me.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.133
You are the strongest person that I know, and I mean it.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.400
After everything you've been through, new school,

02:30.433 --> 02:32.266
it's gonna be a piece of cake, I promise.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.266
- I just...

02:35.300 --> 02:38.266
I don't understand who transfers to a new school

02:38.300 --> 02:40.500
in the middle of senior year.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.933
- Someone whose mom was lucky enough to get a job offer.

02:44.966 --> 02:47.100
Professorships are hard to come by these days.

02:49.066 --> 02:51.466
Okay, you ready?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.800
We don't want to be late for our first day.

02:53.833 --> 02:57.600
Okay. (sighs)

03:02.566 --> 03:05.466
(mysterious music)

03:26.066 --> 03:28.900
(indistinct chatter)

04:11.600 --> 04:14.866
- I love her. - Yeah.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.533
- Knock, knock. - Diane!

04:28.566 --> 04:31.933
- I heard you were already here and, well, here you are!

04:31.966 --> 04:33.533
- Here I am.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.300
- Squirreled away in your office.

04:35.366 --> 04:37.733
- Yes, well, I just have so much work to do.

04:37.766 --> 04:39.600
I wanna hit the ground running.

04:39.633 --> 04:43.566
- Well, this is for you. - Thank you.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.533
- It is. Take a breather.

04:45.566 --> 04:47.533
I just wanna talk to you a minute.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.300
- Okay.

04:51.366 --> 04:54.433
- Look, I know you're excited, and you should be,

04:54.466 --> 04:56.966
but I just wanna manage your expectations.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.566
- What do you mean?

04:58.600 --> 05:00.400
- Well, when I first started,

05:00.433 --> 05:02.366
I thought that I'd be sitting around the quad

05:02.433 --> 05:04.200
discussing Kierkegaard with ambitious students.

05:04.266 --> 05:05.966
(chuckles)

05:06.000 --> 05:07.600
The truth is that half of these students

05:07.633 --> 05:09.166
don't even wanna be here.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.200
Either they have a job that requires a degree or

05:11.266 --> 05:13.833
they screwed around so badly in high school

05:13.866 --> 05:15.700
that they couldn't get into a four-year university.

05:15.766 --> 05:18.033
- Okay, you're right, this is discouraging.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.866
- But the other half...

05:20.933 --> 05:24.633
The other half might not have the money for a university

05:24.666 --> 05:28.766
or they may work a full-time job and need the flexibility.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.033
Or, believe it or not, they may even have a love of literature.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.200
(chuckles)

05:33.266 --> 05:35.000
It's this group that you need to reach.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.300
- I understand.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.600
Honestly, Diane, I am just

05:38.633 --> 05:41.600
grateful for the opportunity. - Well, we're lucky to have you.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.466
- I'm excited to start teaching again.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.166
- And Lily? How's she holding up?

05:45.200 --> 05:47.266
- She's good. Uh, I mean,

05:47.300 --> 05:49.533
no teen is really excited about being uprooted

05:49.600 --> 05:51.600
in the middle of their senior year, but...

05:51.633 --> 05:53.966
- She at Chestnut Falls High? - Mm-hmm.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.533
- My daughter, Katie, graduated from there four years ago.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.166
- Oh, I didn't know that. - Yeah. Great school.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.166
Don't worry about Lily. She'll have no problem fitting in.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.700
- I hope you're right. I mean, she's shy, by nature.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.500
Since Robert died, she's been more introverted than ever.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.433
I just hope she makes an effort.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.033
I know she wants to have friends.

06:13.066 --> 06:16.866
- She'll be fine. But if she struggles, you tell me.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.400
I might know some people who have kids that go there.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.333
- Thank you, Diane, for everything.

06:21.366 --> 06:23.433
- What are old friends for?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.866
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

06:25.900 --> 06:27.000
- Okay.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.566
(relaxing music)

06:37.600 --> 06:39.600
You like? - Mm.

06:41.066 --> 06:43.033
It's not Forni's. (chuckles)

06:43.066 --> 06:44.900
- Nothing's Forni's.

06:44.933 --> 06:48.366
But Diane said this was the best around, so.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.733
- It's not terrible.

06:50.766 --> 06:53.166
- I'm sorry, I wanted to make you a nice dinner

06:53.200 --> 06:55.266
to celebrate your first day of school,

06:55.333 --> 06:57.266
but I'm already so swamped at work.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.033
Plus, I can't find the silverware.

06:59.066 --> 07:01.133
- Mom, it's okay. I know.

07:02.766 --> 07:05.666
- So, tell me. - About?

07:05.733 --> 07:08.666
- Everything. How was it? - Well, uh,

07:08.733 --> 07:11.100
it was only the first day.

07:11.133 --> 07:14.833
So, I just spent most of it just trying to get my bearings

07:14.900 --> 07:17.100
and figure out the best way to get to class.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.766
- How are the teachers?

07:18.800 --> 07:22.500
- They were all pretty nice. And understanding.

07:22.566 --> 07:24.600
But they had that look in their eyes.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.166
- What look?

07:26.233 --> 07:28.166
- Pitty. (chuckles)

07:28.233 --> 07:31.566
- How are the kids? - Kind of just a combination

07:31.600 --> 07:33.433
of scowls and stares.

07:33.466 --> 07:35.933
- Lily... - What?

07:35.966 --> 07:39.100
Do you think that people come up to the new girl on the first day

07:39.133 --> 07:40.733
and say, "Hey, let's be besties!"

07:40.766 --> 07:44.233
- No, that is not what I think, but, I'm just saying,

07:44.266 --> 07:46.333
you have to put yourself out there, you know?

07:46.400 --> 07:49.500
And they will reciprocate. I promise.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.166
(joyful music)

07:52.933 --> 07:55.100
What? (laughing)

07:55.133 --> 07:57.733
- Nothing. - No, I saw that, what?

07:57.766 --> 08:02.800
- Well, there was this one guy. - Oh.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.666
Did you talk to him? - I smiled.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.533
- Well, that's a start. (laughing)

08:08.966 --> 08:12.200
Is he cute? - Mom. Puppies are cute.

08:12.233 --> 08:16.833
- Okay, sorry, was he, "Devastatingly handsome."

08:16.866 --> 08:19.700
- Yes. (laughing)

08:24.066 --> 08:26.300
- Your dad would be so proud of you.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.866
- Of the both of us.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.033
- Yeah.

08:46.900 --> 08:50.733
- Ugh. - Oh, hey, hey, hey.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.400
I think you dropped this.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.000
- Oh, thanks.

08:56.633 --> 09:00.233
Um, I'm, it's just for English class.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.133
I'm heading there now. - Yeah, I know.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.733
- You do?

09:03.766 --> 09:06.533
- Yeah. I was in Mr. Brooks' class. I saw you.

09:06.566 --> 09:07.933
I wanted to say something

09:07.966 --> 09:10.533
but, you just seemed like you had your hands full.

09:10.566 --> 09:12.566
- You have no idea.

09:12.600 --> 09:17.066
- I'm Derek. - I'm Lily. Lily Miller.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.933
- Yeah, I actually got that too when Mr. Brooks introduced you

09:19.966 --> 09:21.700
in front of the entire class.

09:21.733 --> 09:23.300
- That was so embarrassing.

09:23.366 --> 09:25.766
Me having to explain my favourite novel.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.933
- Yeah, look, between you and me, Brooks is a complete tool.

09:28.966 --> 09:30.400
(scoffs)

09:30.433 --> 09:32.300
But, uh, anything by John Irving,

09:32.366 --> 09:34.900
you can't really go wrong. I was pretty impressed.

09:35.766 --> 09:38.800
But... if you're looking for something

09:38.866 --> 09:41.466
a little different and maybe a little bit more wild,

09:41.533 --> 09:42.966
may I suggest.

09:44.933 --> 09:48.466
- Zenith ? I've never heard of it.

09:48.533 --> 09:50.566
- Yeah. I'm not surprised.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.433
Not many people have but, trust me,

09:53.466 --> 09:55.533
that'll change your life.

09:55.566 --> 09:56.766
- Really?

09:56.800 --> 09:58.766
- It did mine.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.100
Come on. We don't want to miss Mr. Brooks' class.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.233
(mysterious music)

10:09.266 --> 10:11.300
(sighs)

10:11.366 --> 10:14.133
- Throughout the novel, Edna Pontellier

10:14.200 --> 10:16.700
makes numerous choices that represent her awakening.

10:16.733 --> 10:19.066
And while all of them reflect the freedom

10:19.100 --> 10:20.900
that she so desperately seeks,

10:20.933 --> 10:24.133
the irony is that it's this very quest for liberation

10:24.200 --> 10:26.433
that is responsible for her death.

10:26.466 --> 10:28.066
- Bullshit!

10:28.966 --> 10:32.066
- Excuse me? - I said that's bullshit.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.700
(scoffs)

10:35.200 --> 10:37.400
- Well, Miss Lawrence.

10:37.433 --> 10:41.233
Since you've commented so eloquently on the material,

10:41.266 --> 10:43.566
maybe you'd like to come up here and teach this class.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.933
- Actually, I'd like you to teach this class.

10:45.966 --> 10:48.400
But maybe give us something remotely insightful

10:48.433 --> 10:50.866
instead of vapid analysis that would embarrass

10:50.900 --> 10:52.466
a middle school student. - Ooh, okay.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.200
(chuckling)

10:54.233 --> 10:55.966
- Vapid? - Yeah, it means something

10:56.033 --> 10:58.200
that's not important-- - I know what it means, Violet.

10:58.233 --> 11:01.433
But I certainly don't appreciate the disruption

11:01.466 --> 11:03.700
or the inconsiderate way in which you've--

11:03.766 --> 11:05.666
- Do your job. (hushes chuckling)

11:05.700 --> 11:09.433
- Excuse me? - I said, then do your job.

11:09.466 --> 11:12.166
An idiot can see that Kate Chopin isn't defending

11:12.200 --> 11:13.600
the society she herself grew up in--

11:13.633 --> 11:15.500
- That will do, Violet! - She's shining a light on

11:15.533 --> 11:17.633
hypocrisy that kept women and especially women

11:17.666 --> 11:19.266
like herself resign-- - Enough!

11:20.633 --> 11:22.200
(exhales)

11:24.700 --> 11:27.700
Go to the office. - Gladly.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.533
(indistinct chatter)

11:38.166 --> 11:39.800
- Where was I?

11:55.533 --> 11:58.966
- Excuse me. Uh, did you get in trouble?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.200
- Detention. One hour after school for a week.

12:02.233 --> 12:03.833
(scoffs) - Sucks.

12:03.866 --> 12:05.700
- It's worth it.

12:05.733 --> 12:08.066
- That was awesome.

12:08.100 --> 12:12.666
Um, I just, I had to tell you that.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.233
- It wasn't anything. It needed to be said.

12:15.266 --> 12:17.066
- I'm just,

12:17.100 --> 12:20.100
I've never heard someone talk to a teacher like that.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.833
Oh, I'm Lily, Lily Miller.

12:24.866 --> 12:28.433
- I know. I saw you talking to Derek.

12:29.666 --> 12:34.600
Relax, you have nothing to worry about. Nobody owns Derek.

12:34.666 --> 12:38.366
(chuckles) - I, I uh,

12:38.400 --> 12:40.100
I just love The Awakening .

12:40.166 --> 12:42.366
My mom introduced it to me.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.733
She is a professor of English literature.

12:45.766 --> 12:50.200
So, hearing Mr. Brooks miss the whole point of the novel--

12:50.233 --> 12:51.833
- I know, right?

12:51.866 --> 12:55.400
- I'm just glad that you set him straight and I didn't have to.

12:56.866 --> 12:58.766
- "The smallest abdication of truth

12:58.833 --> 13:01.000
is death by a thousand cuts."

13:01.066 --> 13:04.466
- Who said that? - It's from Zenith .

13:04.500 --> 13:07.333
- Oh. Derek gave me his copy.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.400
He said that I'd like it.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.333
- I'm sure you will.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.400
If you're the kind of person I think you are.

13:15.566 --> 13:18.800
Hey. What are you doing after school?

13:18.833 --> 13:21.433
Wanna hang out with us once my jail time's over?

13:21.466 --> 13:23.133
- Really? - Why not?

13:24.133 --> 13:26.633
- I mean, I don't know, 'cause-- - Come on!

13:26.666 --> 13:28.800
People like us...

13:30.400 --> 13:32.100
we need to stick together.

13:33.666 --> 13:35.333
(chuckles)

13:36.600 --> 13:38.800
(bell ringing)

13:41.333 --> 13:43.933
(laughing) - Mm. Mm. Mm.

13:51.266 --> 13:53.100
Come over tonight?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.933
- I don't know. - What's the matter?

13:56.966 --> 13:59.133
- Nothing, I'm just, I'm not in the mood.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.500
- Suit yourself. - Hey, hey!

14:00.566 --> 14:03.166
This is what this whole thing is about, right?

14:03.200 --> 14:06.066
Free will. No guilt. No regret.

14:06.133 --> 14:09.166
- Yes. But turn me down again,

14:09.200 --> 14:10.800
and I may have to find someone

14:10.833 --> 14:13.000
who's a little freer with their will.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.000
(sighs)

14:28.900 --> 14:31.833
- It's like we were on the same wavelength.

14:31.866 --> 14:34.666
We talked about the same stuff that you and I talk about.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.533
- Hm. - You don't seem that impressed.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.800
- No, I am, with her analysis,

14:40.833 --> 14:43.700
but I don't really like the way she talked to her teachers.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.800
Sounds kind of disrespectful.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.733
- So, you should only stand by your conviction when it's convenient?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.866
- Mm, no, that's not what I said.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.633
I just feel like there's a way to get what you want

14:54.666 --> 14:57.466
without talking to your teachers disrespectfully.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.366
- Wow! Are you sure that you're the same woman that read me

15:01.400 --> 15:03.100
The Awakening before bed every night?

15:03.133 --> 15:05.900
- Touché. (chuckles)

15:05.933 --> 15:08.433
Alright, why don't you invite her over for dinner?

15:10.233 --> 15:12.400
- I don't know. - What do you mean?

15:12.433 --> 15:15.600
If she's as great as you say she is, I'm sure I'll love her.

15:15.633 --> 15:17.633
Besides, you always introduce me to your friends.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.933
(faucet running)

15:19.966 --> 15:23.066
- Um, I was meaning to ask you...

15:29.766 --> 15:31.066
Have you heard about this?

15:31.100 --> 15:33.066
(mysterious music)

15:33.100 --> 15:35.866
- Zenith? Can't say that I have.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.866
Are you assigned this for school?

15:37.900 --> 15:41.366
- No, no, um, a friend gave it to me.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.966
He said that I'd like it.

15:43.033 --> 15:45.700
- He? - Mom, stop.

15:45.733 --> 15:48.400
- Is this the same friend that you told me about yesterday?

15:48.433 --> 15:50.400
- Maybe.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.533
- Well, you know what I always say, there are no bad books.

15:55.566 --> 15:58.600
- Just those who have yet to find their readers.

15:59.766 --> 16:02.833
Well, it should be an easy read.

16:02.866 --> 16:05.433
I'll let you know what I think.

16:14.866 --> 16:17.133
No, no, no, I loved it.

16:17.166 --> 16:19.866
I told you, I was up all night, it's just, um,

16:19.933 --> 16:22.133
you said to be honest, and there are a few parts

16:22.166 --> 16:25.266
that made me feel a little... uncomfortable.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.133
- Good literature should make you a little uncomfortable.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.000
- Yeah but, what parts, Lily?

16:30.033 --> 16:32.433
- Oh, um...

16:32.466 --> 16:37.133
Where the enlightened ones hold all of the city's knowledge

16:37.166 --> 16:38.966
and distribute it to the different clans.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.366
It just kind of sounds a little bit prejudiced.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.833
- First time I read it I thought the same thing.

16:45.866 --> 16:48.966
Honestly, I did. But then I read it again

16:49.000 --> 16:51.866
and I opened my mind up to what was really being said.

16:51.933 --> 16:55.433
And I understood that it was the exact opposite of that.

16:55.466 --> 16:59.100
Racism, sexism. - Mm-hmm.

16:59.133 --> 17:01.366
- Any ism, really.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.833
They're ideas advanced by the weak, the inferior...

17:05.866 --> 17:07.766
the fearful.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.900
- I assure you, Lily, do you think I would ever belong

17:10.933 --> 17:13.366
to a group that viewed me as inferior?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.733
- Uh, wait, oh, what do you mean belong?

17:16.766 --> 17:18.433
(chuckling)

17:18.500 --> 17:21.900
- Uh, Zenith , it's not just a book.

17:21.933 --> 17:25.666
It's how we choose to live our lives.

17:25.700 --> 17:30.233
- Well, okay, it's how we try to live our lives at least.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.433
- Oh, so kind of like, a Bible.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.100
- Yeah. - Sort of.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.433
(laughing) - Spot on.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.600
- Sure. Zenith isn't a collection

17:38.666 --> 17:42.000
of fairy tales, of mystic fables. It's a blueprint.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.900
- A blueprint?

17:43.933 --> 17:49.333
- For higher awareness, enlightenment... for excellence.

17:50.733 --> 17:54.066
- Doesn't that seem like a little, "Self-helpy"?

17:54.100 --> 17:57.000
- Ooh. - Give it a try.

17:57.033 --> 18:01.233
It'll grow on you. I promise.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.600
(mysterious music)

18:12.433 --> 18:13.933
- For Zenith?

18:15.900 --> 18:18.433
It's... it's beautiful..

18:19.433 --> 18:23.800
- Thank you. Hasn't let me down yet.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.066
(bell ringing)

18:36.133 --> 18:39.166
- Oh, hey, hey, hey! Um, I meant to ask you,

18:39.233 --> 18:42.833
um, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come over

18:42.900 --> 18:45.500
to my house one night for dinner? With my mom.

18:45.566 --> 18:46.966
It's totally cool if you don't want to,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.233
you're probably super busy-- - What night?

18:49.266 --> 18:52.433
- Oh. I don't know, whatever works for you.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.333
- How about tonight?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.933
- Don't you have to ask your mom or anything?

18:55.966 --> 18:58.966
- That's what I'm talking about, Lily.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.366
One of the main lessons of Zenith , I do what I want.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.500
So, if it's cool with you, tonight it is.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.966
(jazz music)

19:09.000 --> 19:10.566
(chuckling)

19:14.200 --> 19:19.500
Mm. Mm. This is really delicious Mrs. Miller.

19:20.133 --> 19:23.966
- I'm glad you like it, Violet. But please, call me Joan.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.366
You guys are practically adults.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.200
- It's just such a change from what I'm used to.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.833
- Your mother doesn't cook? - I wouldn't know.

19:32.866 --> 19:35.200
She's practically always at the office.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.833
- Well, don't be too hard on her.

19:37.866 --> 19:39.400
Being a single mom isn't easy.

19:39.466 --> 19:40.966
- Come on, Mom.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.533
- No. It's okay.

19:45.633 --> 19:48.833
I know it's hard. I wouldn't complain about her hours

19:48.866 --> 19:51.566
if, say, she were a professor like you,

19:51.633 --> 19:54.366
or something else meaningful.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.800
- What does she do? - She's a lawyer.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.133
- Well, now I understand why she's rarely home.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.566
Standing up for the little guy is not easy.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.333
(scoffs)

20:06.366 --> 20:08.633
- Oh. My mother is a corporate attorney.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.966
All her clients are Fortune 500 companies.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.300
She's hardly ever standing up for the little guys.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.200
Crushing them under the heel of her stiletto is more likely.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.300
(sinister music)

20:20.333 --> 20:23.633
- Well, she's giving you a better life,

20:23.666 --> 20:25.333
that's what's important.

20:25.366 --> 20:26.866
I look forward to meeting her, though,

20:26.900 --> 20:29.466
I'm sure we have more in common than you think.

20:30.633 --> 20:36.133
- Well, like I said, she's hardly ever home.

20:40.966 --> 20:43.166
(sighs)

20:50.533 --> 20:53.033
- Um, I don't understand.

20:53.066 --> 20:55.900
Dante Leclerc never wrote another book?

20:55.966 --> 20:57.533
- He never wrote anything else.

20:57.566 --> 20:59.966
He killed himself shortly after Zenith was released.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.266
(scoffs) - Killed himself,

21:01.300 --> 21:04.866
what a load of crap. - What do you mean?

21:04.900 --> 21:06.733
- I mean, they offed him.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.533
Leclerc would have never killed himself,

21:08.566 --> 21:10.766
it goes against everything he believes in.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.033
- But like, who would want him dead and why?

21:13.066 --> 21:15.966
- A lot of people think he was becoming too powerful.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.533
- Powerful how?

21:18.566 --> 21:21.200
- Zenith made a splash when it first came out.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.366
Especially in some circles.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.566
Colleges, underground book clubs, places like that.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.566
For a lot of readers, Leclerc was a breath of fresh air.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.800
Most books that are promoted by the mainstream

21:32.866 --> 21:34.366
love the victim narrative.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.933
A protagonist is always at the mercy of others,

21:36.966 --> 21:40.866
whether it's the government, religion, the rich.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.466
Leclerc didn't believe this.

21:43.533 --> 21:47.733
He believed that we all hold the power to change the world.

21:47.766 --> 21:51.766
For good or for evil, as Zeni shows.

21:52.266 --> 21:55.366
- Still, people do lots of crazy things,

21:55.400 --> 21:57.700
some even dangerous and they don't get killed.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.433
(both): Yeah. - Really Violet.

22:00.700 --> 22:02.200
(mysterious music)

22:02.266 --> 22:03.866
- Oh, shoot.

22:03.933 --> 22:05.666
- I'm just telling you what I heard.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.200
- Oh my God I'm so sorry! - What the hell!

22:08.266 --> 22:09.466
- I totally didn't see you there.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.933
Wait, let me just--

22:10.966 --> 22:12.866
- What are you, delusional, oh my God.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.133
Don't touch me, skank.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.500
- Hey, hey! Hey!

22:20.366 --> 22:22.466
- Are you okay? - Yeah, oh yeah, I'm fine.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.833
I just, um--

22:23.866 --> 22:26.200
- Someone needs to put that bitch in her place.

22:26.266 --> 22:28.166
- Are you okay?

22:30.466 --> 22:32.033
(sighs)

22:32.100 --> 22:34.600
- It's okay.

22:34.633 --> 22:36.833
(sighs)

22:47.033 --> 22:50.333
(mysterious music)

23:21.100 --> 23:25.166
- Hey. Slow down. - Are you on your period?

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
- No.

23:27.666 --> 23:30.266
I just honestly can't stop thinking about that bitch

23:30.333 --> 23:31.933
throwing yoghurt on me.

23:37.533 --> 23:41.366
- Cognac. Took it from my dad.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.233
- Hm. How classy.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.233
Ugh.

23:47.166 --> 23:49.266
What was that?

23:49.333 --> 23:50.600
(scoffs)

23:50.666 --> 23:54.000
- I don't know, Amanda. Maybe it was a racoon.

23:54.033 --> 23:58.233
A possum. But if you don't want to, just say so.

23:58.266 --> 24:01.500
- I heard something, Jack, I'm telling you.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.600
Whatever.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.266
(door slams)

24:13.666 --> 24:17.133
(mysterious music)

24:39.566 --> 24:42.333
Let's just go to the practice field behind the high school.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.733
At least we'll be back in civilization.

24:44.766 --> 24:47.133
- Whatever you say.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.133
(engine starts)

24:57.500 --> 25:00.566
(mysterious music)

25:07.166 --> 25:09.033
(engine starts)

25:17.366 --> 25:19.700
(indistinct chatter)

25:27.066 --> 25:30.333
- Hey, what's going on? Everybody looks like zombies.

25:30.366 --> 25:33.633
- You didn't hear? - Hear what?

25:34.400 --> 25:38.300
- Amanda Williams and her boyfriend, Jack...

25:39.633 --> 25:42.966
- Dude. - Wait. What?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.300
- They were driving home,

25:44.333 --> 25:47.300
probably from making out on the bluffs.

25:47.333 --> 25:49.633
And then his truck went...

25:50.400 --> 25:52.166
(imitates explosion)

25:52.200 --> 25:53.533
Went off the road.

25:55.366 --> 25:58.966
- So... they're both dead?

25:59.000 --> 26:03.533
- No. Jack died on impact but Amanda is in a coma.

26:03.566 --> 26:05.466
- Is she gonna be okay?

26:06.933 --> 26:10.066
- We can hope, right? That's all we can do, is hope.

26:12.433 --> 26:14.733
(sighs)

26:19.633 --> 26:22.733
- None of us wanted Amanda or Jack to die.

26:22.766 --> 26:25.400
You know that, right?

26:26.233 --> 26:28.566
But the world is a far better place

26:28.600 --> 26:30.533
without either of them in it.

26:30.566 --> 26:32.433
That's the truth.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.800
And as Zenith says,

26:34.866 --> 26:38.633
"Truth is sacred. Above all else."

26:41.400 --> 26:45.900
(mysterious music)

26:49.433 --> 26:50.866
(sighs)

26:55.200 --> 26:57.400
(indistinct chatter)

26:58.133 --> 27:01.466
- Okay, okay, not bad, but that's-- - No, stop.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.533
(laughing)

27:03.600 --> 27:05.000
- Hi!

27:07.166 --> 27:08.800
- Lily! Hi! (gasps)

27:08.833 --> 27:10.533
Lily, I didn't know you had friends over.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.833
- Oh, um, we're just hanging out, Mom.

27:12.866 --> 27:14.666
- Hi Mrs. Mi... uh, I mean, Joan.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.033
- Hi Violet. Nice to see you.

27:17.100 --> 27:20.300
- Uh, Mom, this is Derek.

27:20.333 --> 27:23.666
- Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.766
- Okay, we'll, I'll just be here if you guys need anything.

27:31.333 --> 27:35.033
- Um. - Ahem.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.466
So, what does your mom do?

27:38.500 --> 27:44.000
- She's a professor at Eastern Hemlock Community College.

27:44.033 --> 27:45.800
- Oh. - Mm. - Mm-hmm.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.966
- Yeah, no, she seems super cool.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
- Mm. - Yeah, she is.

27:51.033 --> 27:53.000
Sometimes, I guess.

27:53.033 --> 27:55.866
- Yeah, I mean, you don't want her too cool, right?

27:55.933 --> 27:59.300
Do you remember Becca's mom? - Ugh. Yeah.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.766
- Who's that?

28:00.800 --> 28:02.700
- A girl we used to hang out with.

28:02.733 --> 28:05.666
- Used to. Yeah, her mom had like no boundaries.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.333
She thought she was, "Our friend."

28:07.366 --> 28:09.266
- It was totally pathetic.

28:09.333 --> 28:11.900
- Yeah, it was like she was trying to relive her youth or something,

28:11.933 --> 28:13.666
I don't know, it made me super uncomfortable.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.266
(laughing) - Aw.

28:15.333 --> 28:16.833
- I'm super happy, I'm just happy Becca's graduated,

28:16.866 --> 28:18.333
that's all I'm gonna say.

28:18.366 --> 28:20.400
(laughing)

28:24.600 --> 28:27.366
(Lily): See you guys tomorrow. (door shuts)

28:30.266 --> 28:32.600
- They both leave? - Yep.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.600
- They seem nice. - Uh-huh.

28:37.666 --> 28:41.033
- Although I couldn't help but overhear you kids...

28:41.566 --> 28:43.166
- Overhear what?

28:44.233 --> 28:45.933
- Overhear what you guy were talking about.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.833
- You were eavesdropping? - Well, I wouldn't call it that.

28:48.866 --> 28:51.533
- You can't just listen to my private conversations.

28:51.566 --> 28:53.200
- Private conversations?

28:53.233 --> 28:55.733
Lily, I was in the kitchen making you something to eat,

28:55.766 --> 28:57.533
I couldn't help but hear.

28:57.566 --> 28:59.233
But that's not the issue.

28:59.266 --> 29:02.000
I heard Violet call somebody pathetic

29:02.066 --> 29:04.000
- Oh, yeah,

29:04.066 --> 29:07.000
it was just someone's mom who they used to hang out with.

29:08.133 --> 29:09.500
- I hope it wasn't your mom.

29:09.566 --> 29:12.500
- You think that we were talking about you?

29:13.266 --> 29:16.333
God, Mom. Get over yourself.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.966
- Get over myself? Whoa.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.133
Uh, I don't know who you think you are,

29:22.166 --> 29:24.333
maybe that's how Violet talks to her mom,

29:24.400 --> 29:27.166
but that is not how we talk to each other in this house.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.966
- Whatever.

29:40.133 --> 29:42.300
- That was fun, the other night at your house.

29:42.333 --> 29:45.500
- Yeah, until my Mom showed up. - Why? She seems harmless.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.466
- Well, I found out that she was eavesdropping on our conversation.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.066
- You serious? That's not right.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.266
Privacy is one of the unalienable rights

29:53.300 --> 29:54.766
according to Zenith.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.733
- Well, I don't know what I could do about it.

29:57.766 --> 29:59.633
- I know what we could do about it.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.300
We can hang out at my place.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.833
- Really? - Sure.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.166
Like I said, my mom's never home.

30:05.233 --> 30:06.633
- Cool.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.733
(upbeat music)

30:13.400 --> 30:14.966
- No.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.600
Okay. This is your house?

30:20.633 --> 30:22.133
- Yup.

30:22.166 --> 30:24.966
- It's... it's enormous.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.900
- All that means is in the middle of the night

30:27.933 --> 30:29.300
it takes longer to pee.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.266
- Ew, what?!

30:31.300 --> 30:34.500
- Trust me, it's just a normal house, like any other.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.833
Come on.

30:42.066 --> 30:44.966
- Whoa. (chuckles)

30:45.000 --> 30:48.233
This isn't just a house.

30:48.266 --> 30:50.833
- You want the tour? - Yes!

30:50.900 --> 30:55.000
- Come on. Voila. - Whoa!

30:55.066 --> 30:58.800
Does anybody even eat in here? - No.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.233
But sometimes an espresso is brewed

31:02.533 --> 31:05.033
I wanna show you my room. - Okay.

31:05.066 --> 31:07.000
(laughing)

31:14.066 --> 31:16.533
I'm so excited to see your room. - You should be.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.033
- What? - My room.

31:25.066 --> 31:28.166
- This is your room? (gasps)

31:28.200 --> 31:32.566
Wow. Oh my. - Right?

31:34.966 --> 31:37.833
(relaxing music)

31:37.866 --> 31:39.533
- I love it.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.966
- I hoped you'd say that.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.633
Think of this as your room too,

31:47.666 --> 31:51.366
whenever things at home get too tough...

31:51.400 --> 31:54.033
Whenever you need to get away.

31:54.066 --> 31:56.233
(hip-hop music)

32:13.533 --> 32:15.733
Party time!

32:18.200 --> 32:19.400
Mm.

32:23.433 --> 32:24.966
Trust me.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.033
You're gonna want this.

32:30.566 --> 32:31.900
How is it?

32:32.433 --> 32:35.400
- Oh, so gross. - Gross?

32:35.433 --> 32:38.066
- Yes! - I like it.

32:42.633 --> 32:43.800
(doorbell rings)

32:43.866 --> 32:46.366
I wonder who that could be?

32:47.800 --> 32:52.100
No, no, no. You stay here. I'll be right back.

32:59.533 --> 33:01.466
- So bad.

33:02.766 --> 33:04.700
(knocking)

33:07.133 --> 33:09.300
- Hi. - Hey.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.133
Um, where's Violet?

33:12.166 --> 33:14.666
- Oh, she's... she went to get some glasses.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.033
- Oh. - Can I come in?

33:17.633 --> 33:19.300
- Yeah, sure.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.000
- So, you've seen the place. - Mm-hmm.

33:33.033 --> 33:34.633
(chuckles)

33:34.666 --> 33:38.000
- Mm, can I have some? - Yes, of course.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.800
- Bourbon.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.800
- Whoa! (laughing)

33:49.000 --> 33:52.166
No, I don't really like it. (laughing)

33:53.833 --> 33:55.800
- Okay, well, I have a little trick

33:55.833 --> 33:57.333
that can make it taste a little better.

33:57.366 --> 33:58.700
You trust me?

34:11.433 --> 34:13.566
(giggling)

34:14.100 --> 34:15.833
- How was that?

34:38.533 --> 34:41.100
- I dug this out of my mom's closet.

34:43.433 --> 34:46.100
- Wow. You look so sexy.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.400
- Do you like it?

34:52.433 --> 34:54.100
(giggles)

35:52.600 --> 35:54.933
- Hi, this is Lily, you know what to do,

35:54.966 --> 35:56.433
or better yet, text me.

35:56.466 --> 35:57.566
(sighs)

35:57.600 --> 35:59.800
(beeps) - Hi, it's your mom, again.

35:59.833 --> 36:02.233
I have texted you, multiple times.

36:02.300 --> 36:06.633
I'm slowly going from annoyed to worried, so, call me back.

36:06.666 --> 36:09.533
Unless you want me to contact the police.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.700
(sighs)

36:30.333 --> 36:33.033
- Hi. - Hey.

36:35.900 --> 36:38.966
- Have you ever done anything like that before?

36:39.000 --> 36:43.066
- I, uh... no.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.966
- And how are you feeling about it?

36:50.733 --> 36:53.233
- I'm, I'm not sure.

36:54.733 --> 36:57.366
- It's common to feel guilty.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.400
Even a little ashamed.

36:59.466 --> 37:02.200
- Yeah. You really shouldn't. - Right, you shouldn't.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.433
- I'm beginning to like this philosophy.

37:08.866 --> 37:12.300
- Takes a special kind of person to realize that.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.533
I wanna show you something.

37:16.566 --> 37:20.200
- No, Violet, it's way too soon. - I don't think so.

37:20.233 --> 37:21.900
- What is it?

37:28.233 --> 37:31.100
- It's the Z, for Zenith.

37:31.133 --> 37:33.966
- We all have one, on our left hip.

37:34.033 --> 37:37.633
- It's branded into our skin to show our loyalty to the book

37:37.700 --> 37:40.266
and to each other. We just have to make sure to place them

37:40.300 --> 37:42.433
somewhere our parents can't see them.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.800
- I want one.

37:46.866 --> 37:49.300
- No, Lily, you don't have to say that just because--

37:49.366 --> 37:53.766
- No. I want one. I'm positive.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.600
- I know how close you are to your mother, Lily.

37:58.633 --> 38:02.700
But you can never mention this to her.

38:02.766 --> 38:05.166
That would be bad...

38:05.200 --> 38:06.700
for all of us.

38:06.766 --> 38:08.433
- Of course not.

38:11.033 --> 38:13.166
- And after it's done...

38:14.866 --> 38:16.500
You get to wear this.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.866
- Just like yours.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.966
- Yeah. The guys wear a ring,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.033
the girls wear a necklace.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.600
- That's right. Although I can't seem to find mine,

38:31.633 --> 38:34.266
I don't know what the hell happened to it.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.033
Anyway.

38:37.333 --> 38:40.966
After this, everything changes.

38:45.833 --> 38:48.766
♪ Another girl

38:48.800 --> 38:51.833
♪ Pretending to be nice

38:51.866 --> 38:54.966
♪ So dangerous inside

38:59.833 --> 39:01.400
- This is gonna hurt.

39:09.033 --> 39:10.600
- Ah!

39:11.500 --> 39:14.400
- You're okay. That's it.

39:29.366 --> 39:31.866
- Ugh, you're alive. (sighs)

39:32.233 --> 39:34.233
- Of course I'm alive.

39:34.266 --> 39:36.833
- Do you have any idea how late it is?

39:36.866 --> 39:39.900
- I, it's just late. - Yeah, late.

39:39.933 --> 39:41.666
I called and texted like a million times,

39:41.700 --> 39:43.833
you didn't get them? - No, I...

39:43.866 --> 39:45.733
I just wasn't checking my phone.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.700
- Okay. Where were you?

39:49.733 --> 39:52.366
- I was, um,

39:52.400 --> 39:54.833
I was at Violet's just hanging out.

39:56.066 --> 40:00.866
- Look, I want you to stay out late if you want to have fun,

40:00.900 --> 40:03.166
it's your senior year. I get it.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.866
But I just need to know where you are

40:05.900 --> 40:07.600
and that you're okay.

40:08.066 --> 40:11.066
- Okay. - Okay.

40:14.733 --> 40:16.500
(sighs)

40:19.333 --> 40:22.833
- Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm just, um,

40:22.866 --> 40:24.500
I'm just a little sore.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.333
- You guys, you weren't drinking or anything, right?

40:28.366 --> 40:32.033
- God, Mom, no. I wasn't drinking, I wasn't doing drugs.

40:32.066 --> 40:34.866
I was just... I was just hanging out with my friends, okay?

40:34.900 --> 40:38.166
So, maybe you could give me a little friggin' privacy.

40:49.533 --> 40:51.266
(sighs)

40:53.733 --> 40:56.433
- I'm not just your boss, Joan, I'm also your friend.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.666
Come on, you can tell me, what is it?

40:58.700 --> 41:00.333
- It's nothing. It's nothing.

41:00.366 --> 41:02.833
- The students? - No. Actually,

41:02.900 --> 41:06.400
they've been much more receptive than I anticipated.

41:06.433 --> 41:09.300
- Then what? Have the other professors been rude?

41:09.333 --> 41:12.566
- No, no, everybody here has been incredibly kind.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.966
- Don't treat me like a fool, Joan. I know something's wrong.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.833
(sighs)

41:18.900 --> 41:21.466
- It's Lily. - Lily?

41:21.500 --> 41:23.600
I thought you said she was doing great.

41:23.633 --> 41:25.900
You said she already made friends and everything.

41:25.933 --> 41:29.400
- Yeah. It's the friends. One friend in particular.

41:29.433 --> 41:32.633
She is unlike any friend Lily has ever had.

41:32.666 --> 41:35.800
I swear, she has changed her.

41:35.833 --> 41:37.600
- Changed her how?

41:37.633 --> 41:41.300
- It's hard to pinpoint, but...

41:41.333 --> 41:44.100
she's just different.

41:44.133 --> 41:46.000
- Take it from someone who knows.

41:46.066 --> 41:48.500
It's probably just a case of senior-itis.

41:48.566 --> 41:50.966
Girls her age, when they get college in their sights,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.666
ooh, they tend to go a little...

41:53.733 --> 41:55.133
(laughing)

41:55.166 --> 41:57.466
- Yeah. Maybe that's it.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.833
- Look, Joan, don't worry at all about Lily.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.566
She has a good head on her shoulders. You'll see.

42:03.633 --> 42:05.500
She'll be fine.

42:09.900 --> 42:12.333
(indistinct chatter)

42:15.400 --> 42:18.400
- Hi, Violet, how are you? - Hi, Joan.

42:18.466 --> 42:21.966
- Um, we're gonna go to Violet's house.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.500
I'm gonna sleep over there tonight,

42:23.533 --> 42:25.066
I'm just gonna pick up some clothes.

42:25.133 --> 42:27.066
- Yeah, okay, will your mother be home?

42:27.133 --> 42:28.666
- Mom.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.066
That's so embarrassing.

42:31.133 --> 42:35.133
- What... I just wanna talk to your mom, make sure it's okay.

42:35.166 --> 42:38.800
- It's fine, Joan. I'll give you her number.

42:38.833 --> 42:40.400
(upbeat music)

42:40.466 --> 42:42.666
- Okay, but I could use some new clothes.

42:42.700 --> 42:45.866
- Nah, there's plenty I could do with this stuff.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.233
- Okay.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.166
- All we need is a pair of scissors and bleach.

42:49.200 --> 42:53.300
- Huh! This is cool. - Mm-hmm.

42:53.333 --> 42:55.133
- May I? - Mm-hmm.

42:58.866 --> 43:03.400
- Oh, I saw that the other day when we were changing.

43:03.433 --> 43:08.633
- Oh. Yeah, ancient history. - What happened?

43:10.766 --> 43:13.366
- Um, supposedly, I rolled onto one of those

43:13.400 --> 43:15.400
electric bottle warmers.

43:15.433 --> 43:19.900
My mother left it on by mistake when she was changing me.

43:19.933 --> 43:22.300
That's what she told me, anyway.

43:26.533 --> 43:30.100
Hm. Okay. What do you think?

43:30.133 --> 43:34.133
- I think that it looks better on you than it does on me.

43:34.566 --> 43:37.533
- Well, when we get back to my place,

43:37.566 --> 43:41.433
you can raid my closet, okay?

43:41.466 --> 43:43.933
(giggling)

43:46.633 --> 43:49.533
Okay. - Okay. Let's go.

43:54.033 --> 43:56.233
- You talk to her? - Yes.

43:56.266 --> 43:59.600
- So, everything cool? - Everything is cool.

43:59.633 --> 44:02.666
- Okay. I don't know when I'll be home, but I'll text you.

44:02.700 --> 44:03.766
(laughing)

44:03.800 --> 44:05.633
- Bye, Joan. - Bye-bye.

44:05.666 --> 44:08.433
Have fun, girls. - Ha, ha.

44:08.466 --> 44:10.100
(door slams)

44:11.000 --> 44:12.500
(sighs)

44:19.766 --> 44:23.700
- I mean, back in like the 7th grade we were friends,

44:23.766 --> 44:27.166
but, ever since high school I haven't said a word to her.

44:27.200 --> 44:30.366
The only time she's acknowledged me is to

44:30.433 --> 44:33.700
tell me to get out of the way or to mock me about something.

44:33.766 --> 44:37.600
- Still, don't you feel like, at least... a little bad?

44:37.633 --> 44:39.333
I mean, she's in a coma.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.666
- Amanda was brain-dead a long time ago.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.533
(chuckles)

44:44.600 --> 44:46.033
- I guess.

44:47.933 --> 44:51.266
- Lily... Lily.

44:51.300 --> 44:55.600
You're gonna need to learn that giving energy,

44:55.633 --> 44:57.600
no matter how little,

44:57.633 --> 44:59.766
to someone who doesn't care about you,

44:59.800 --> 45:03.900
is that much more energy that you could be using on yourself.

45:03.933 --> 45:08.533
Or on people you do care about and who care about you.

45:08.566 --> 45:10.766
- I know, it's just...

45:10.833 --> 45:14.200
it's hard to think like that, you know?

45:14.766 --> 45:15.666
(gasps)

45:18.400 --> 45:19.533
Uh...

45:20.033 --> 45:22.233
I'm... I'm so sorry.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.366
(chuckles softly)

45:33.233 --> 45:34.766
(clears throat)

45:36.233 --> 45:37.233
- Not terrible,

45:38.666 --> 45:41.000
but the next time you girls raid my liquor cabinet,

45:42.100 --> 45:43.400
try the 12-year single malt.

45:44.700 --> 45:47.700
- Mom, this Lily. - I gathered.

45:48.700 --> 45:51.733
- It's nice to meet you, miss Lawrence.

45:51.766 --> 45:53.666
(chuckling)

45:53.700 --> 45:56.733
- Oh, please. I would make the joke about Mrs. Lawrence being my mother

45:56.766 --> 46:00.966
if she deserved to be called that. But I'm Harper.

46:01.666 --> 46:03.066
Always Harper.

46:03.766 --> 46:06.233
- You going out? - I have a work thing.

46:06.833 --> 46:08.833
Shouldn't be home too late, unless I am,

46:08.900 --> 46:10.900
in which case, I will see you tomorrow.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.433
You really are very beautiful, Lily.

46:16.833 --> 46:19.233
- Thanks. - Isn't she?

46:20.333 --> 46:21.433
(sighs)

46:22.833 --> 46:24.566
- Be safe, girls.

46:30.566 --> 46:33.300
- Oh, my God. That's your mom?

46:35.266 --> 46:36.800
She doesn't look much older than you.

46:36.833 --> 46:39.400
- Oh, she knows it, believe me.

46:39.433 --> 46:41.633
- Oh my God, she's so cool!

46:41.966 --> 46:43.833
She's nothing like my mom.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.600
- Then you need to do something about that.

46:47.733 --> 46:48.600
- What do you mean?

46:50.133 --> 46:52.400
- Lily, come on.

46:54.066 --> 46:55.133
Remember Zenith?

46:56.233 --> 46:58.400
You can't wait for people to change.

46:58.966 --> 47:01.033
It'll never happen. It's human nature.

47:02.833 --> 47:05.866
You need to make them change.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.200
It may not be easy,

47:09.866 --> 47:11.366
but it is necessary.

47:18.633 --> 47:19.733
(sighs)

47:22.233 --> 47:24.200
(chuckles lightly)

47:24.866 --> 47:28.633
- So, in this and other ways, it becomes apparent

47:28.666 --> 47:32.633
that jealousy is the overriding force behind many of the character's actions.

47:33.033 --> 47:36.500
The fact that Casaubon puts such a stipulation in his will

47:36.866 --> 47:39.400
shows how unbearable he finds the thought

47:39.466 --> 47:41.300
of Dorothea with another man.

47:41.333 --> 47:42.666
(scoffs)

47:42.700 --> 47:44.166
- Typical chauvinistic view.

47:44.733 --> 47:46.000
- I'm sorry, miss Miller?

47:47.400 --> 47:49.400
- I just said that that's a typical chauvinistic view,

47:49.466 --> 47:51.500
which isn't surprising.

47:52.700 --> 47:54.566
- Oh no? - No.

47:54.633 --> 47:58.500
I mean, it's pretty obvious when you assign the same vapid authors.

48:00.700 --> 48:01.966
(chuckles)

48:03.366 --> 48:06.233
- You mean this vapid woman author, Lily?

48:06.866 --> 48:08.966
Because if you had been listening to anything I've said

48:09.033 --> 48:13.233
you'd know that George Eliot is the pen name for Mary Anne Evans.

48:14.466 --> 48:17.533
So before you try to get some attention for yourself,

48:18.133 --> 48:20.266
you might want to make sure that your argument is solid.

48:22.700 --> 48:24.700
- So stupid!

48:28.933 --> 48:31.033
(indistinct whispering)

48:35.233 --> 48:37.266
(sighs)

48:41.366 --> 48:43.566
I made a fool out of myself. - No, you didn't.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.700
- Brooks is the fool, Lily.

48:44.733 --> 48:46.233
(sighs) - I just...

48:46.700 --> 48:48.200
I wanted to be like you.

48:49.800 --> 48:54.766
- You are like me. Just... like me.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.266
Remember the brand.

49:00.766 --> 49:04.366
Don't worry about Brooks, I'll take care of it.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.166
I promise.

49:11.200 --> 49:15.266
(♪)

49:34.266 --> 49:37.633
(intriguing music)

49:41.200 --> 49:44.600
(bell ringing)

49:50.166 --> 49:52.633
- We'll talk about this in class tomorrow. Okay?

50:16.533 --> 50:20.100
(dramatic music)

50:30.333 --> 50:32.933
(typing)

50:55.966 --> 50:59.366
(♪)

51:30.166 --> 51:32.366
- Thanks for the ride. - Yeah.

51:34.100 --> 51:36.333
Lily, I need to talk to you about Violet.

51:36.366 --> 51:37.333
- Okay.

51:39.766 --> 51:41.533
- I've never seen her like this before.

51:41.566 --> 51:43.000
- Like what?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.533
- So... vindictive.

51:46.566 --> 51:49.000
Is this going further than we wanted to?

51:51.733 --> 51:54.533
- She's the one who opened my eyes to everything.

51:54.566 --> 51:58.166
To our teachers, to how my mom's been controlling me--

51:58.200 --> 52:00.666
- See that? That's what I'm talking about.

52:01.266 --> 52:03.766
Your mom, she seemed pretty chill.

52:04.833 --> 52:08.500
- Look, I appreciate your concern Derek,

52:08.566 --> 52:11.900
but she's my mom, so I'll decide how to handle her.

52:12.766 --> 52:13.666
- Okay.

52:14.633 --> 52:15.800
(sighs)

52:25.400 --> 52:26.566
- Oh!

52:29.300 --> 52:30.666
Okay.

52:32.133 --> 52:33.133
- Hello?

52:35.266 --> 52:37.466
- Hey! - What are you doing?

52:38.166 --> 52:40.166
- I was just putting away some laundry.

52:40.233 --> 52:41.766
- Why are you bringing them back down?

52:43.433 --> 52:46.166
- I heard the door, so I don't know, I just forgot to leave it.

52:46.233 --> 52:47.900
- What are you even doing home?

52:47.933 --> 52:51.466
- Well, classes were out at noon, so I decided

52:51.500 --> 52:53.633
it would be a good time to get some chores done around here.

52:54.666 --> 52:55.733
How was your day?

52:56.633 --> 52:58.133
- Why, did you hear something?

52:59.900 --> 53:01.733
- Actually, I did get an interesting call from your vice-principal,

53:01.800 --> 53:04.733
Mr. Hillstrom. - What did he say?

53:05.700 --> 53:06.700
- You don't know?

53:07.733 --> 53:08.900
- It wasn't a big deal!

53:09.500 --> 53:12.033
- Would you consider suspension a big deal?

53:12.066 --> 53:13.700
- What? - That's what he said is gonna happen

53:13.733 --> 53:16.033
if you talk to your teacher again like that.

53:16.066 --> 53:18.033
(scoffs) - Okay, yeah, whatever.

53:18.066 --> 53:20.133
- No! Not whatever!

53:20.166 --> 53:22.833
Lily, I need you to promise me that's not gonna happen again.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.700
- God! Mom, can you just give me some space?

53:25.733 --> 53:28.066
Is that too much to ask? - Space?

53:28.133 --> 53:30.500
Space is all I've been giving you since we moved here,

53:30.533 --> 53:31.866
I think maybe space is the problem.

53:31.900 --> 53:34.033
- No, I think that you're the problem.

53:36.566 --> 53:38.166
- I don't even recognize you anymore.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.466
- Well, maybe if you didn't take me for granted,

53:40.500 --> 53:42.800
I'm the same person that I've always been,

53:42.833 --> 53:44.500
it's just you're too...

53:44.533 --> 53:46.566
You're too self-centred to notice.

53:47.166 --> 53:49.000
I'm gonna go upstairs and do my homework,

53:49.033 --> 53:50.533
I hope that that's acceptable.

53:56.533 --> 53:57.366
(door slams)

54:04.866 --> 54:09.400
- Now, when Fitzgerald said there are no second acts to American lives,

54:10.033 --> 54:12.066
to what was he referring?

54:13.766 --> 54:14.966
Anybody?

54:15.766 --> 54:17.433
Come on, somebody.

54:18.733 --> 54:22.800
Miss Lawrence, you must have something to contribute?

54:23.300 --> 54:27.033
(knocking) - Mr. Brooks, a moment please?

54:28.033 --> 54:31.633
- Uh, class, just bear with me, please, I won't be long.

54:36.266 --> 54:38.533
- Hey! What do you think that was about.

54:38.566 --> 54:42.133
(♪)

54:43.466 --> 54:45.933
- I don't think we'll be seeing Mr. Brooks anytime soon.

54:45.966 --> 54:47.366
- How do you know?

54:50.066 --> 54:51.766
- I made a promise to you, Lily.

54:52.300 --> 54:54.266
After what Brooks did to you...

54:54.300 --> 54:56.233
- You mean that you're responsible for--

54:56.266 --> 54:58.433
- Shh...

54:58.466 --> 55:00.933
(chuckles)

55:02.800 --> 55:06.533
- Students, please read quietly for the rest of class.

55:06.600 --> 55:08.133
Thank you.

55:26.266 --> 55:29.466
(dramatic music)

55:39.133 --> 55:41.266
- This is what they've become obsessed with,

55:41.300 --> 55:42.366
she and her friends.

55:43.033 --> 55:45.333
- What is it? - Zenith.

55:45.366 --> 55:46.266
You've never heard of it?

55:46.666 --> 55:48.966
- No, had you? - Mm-mmm, no.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.100
The book nor the author.

55:51.433 --> 55:52.200
And there isn't much about either of them online.

55:53.266 --> 55:54.766
- Did you actually read it? - I did.

55:55.266 --> 55:56.766
- And?

55:56.800 --> 56:00.666
- I mean... it isn't particularly special.

56:00.700 --> 56:02.266
The story is not much.

56:02.333 --> 56:04.500
Something for him to hang his beliefs on, really.

56:04.533 --> 56:07.766
Sort of a mash up of Nietzsche, Ayn Rand,

56:07.833 --> 56:10.000
a little bit or Orwell, maybe some of...

56:10.033 --> 56:12.766
Baudrillard's nihilism thrown in.

56:12.833 --> 56:13.733
- Juvenile.

56:15.166 --> 56:16.433
- Hmm, so is Nietzsche if you take his ideas seriously.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.433
(chuckles)

56:18.500 --> 56:22.033
But I do understand how it could be appealing to teenagers.

56:22.066 --> 56:23.500
I mean, smart teens.

56:23.533 --> 56:26.000
Ones that are bored with Jane Austen and Dickens.

56:26.366 --> 56:28.600
- But you don't think it's dangerous?

56:29.366 --> 56:32.333
- No, but then again,

56:32.366 --> 56:35.666
nobody thought Catcher in the Rye was particularly persuasive

56:35.700 --> 56:36.900
until they found it on Chapman.

56:36.933 --> 56:40.033
- True. So the problem is her friends.

56:40.066 --> 56:44.266
- Friend. Violet. - Not Violet Lawrence?

56:44.866 --> 56:46.566
- Yes. You know her?

56:46.600 --> 56:50.266
- No, but her sister, she was in my daughter's class.

56:50.333 --> 56:53.366
Always in trouble. If not with the school, then with the cops.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.400
- Cops? Seriously?

56:55.433 --> 56:57.533
- Yeah, but I don't think it was anything terrible.

56:57.566 --> 57:01.266
Vandalism, underage drinking, drugs.

57:01.733 --> 57:04.666
She was smart though. Extremely bright.

57:04.733 --> 57:06.100
That much I do remember.

57:07.666 --> 57:09.733
It's always the smart ones you need to watch out for, right?

57:11.000 --> 57:12.400
- Are you sure Diane?

57:12.433 --> 57:14.566
Violet never mentioned anything about a sister.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.266
- Positive.

57:16.300 --> 57:18.833
I actually thought the girls moved away after the accident.

57:19.300 --> 57:21.433
But they must've moved back.

57:21.466 --> 57:22.566
- What accident?

57:23.300 --> 57:24.666
- You don't know? - No.

57:24.733 --> 57:25.933
- The girls' parents.

57:25.966 --> 57:27.900
They were killed in an accident years ago.

57:27.933 --> 57:31.300
Hiking, I think. It was terrible.

57:32.433 --> 57:36.800
- I... Diane, no, I spoke to the mom.

57:37.466 --> 57:38.900
- I don't know what to tell you,

57:38.933 --> 57:40.600
but if we're talking about the same family,

57:40.633 --> 57:43.433
then you must've spoken to a ghost.

57:43.466 --> 57:46.066
(♪)

57:52.566 --> 57:53.900
- I saw the cops take him away.

57:53.933 --> 57:55.233
- For real? - I swear to God.

57:55.266 --> 57:57.500
- Was he cuffed? - No, he wasn't cuffed.

57:57.566 --> 58:00.100
But they definitely put him in the back of the squad car,

58:00.133 --> 58:02.800
it's not like they just said, "Hey, meet us at the station" or something.

58:02.833 --> 58:03.800
- Oh, my gosh.

58:05.233 --> 58:06.700
- Did Mr. Brooks have a reputation for things like this?

58:07.066 --> 58:08.500
- I mean, he always creeped me out.

58:10.033 --> 58:11.200
- I heard it was a freshman, that's who he was caught with.

58:11.233 --> 58:13.633
- Nuh-uh, he wasn't caught with her,

58:13.966 --> 58:18.833
I heard there were pictures. Dirty pictures.

58:18.866 --> 58:20.700
- Oh, my God. - The truth is, none of us

58:20.733 --> 58:22.733
really know what happened. It's all just rumours.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.533
- Well, something happened, we know that.

58:25.566 --> 58:28.366
They don't just grab a teacher and haul him out in cuffs.

58:28.400 --> 58:30.833
- I said he wasn't cuffed. - Just an expression, Peter.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.700
- I can't wait for the email. - Email?

58:33.733 --> 58:36.633
- Yeah. Whenever something like this happens,

58:36.666 --> 58:38.666
something embarrassing for the school,

58:39.200 --> 58:41.800
the super intendant and principal always send out an email

58:41.833 --> 58:43.066
to the students and parents.

58:43.133 --> 58:44.966
- They try to like get ahead of the story,

58:45.366 --> 58:47.000
you know, spin it a little. - Exactly.

58:47.033 --> 58:50.633
Unfortunately for them, they won't be able to spin this one.

58:50.666 --> 58:52.066
- What?

58:52.133 --> 58:54.033
Okay, I thought you said you didn't know what happened?

58:54.066 --> 58:56.533
- Just an educated guess. Ava?

58:56.566 --> 58:58.033
- Yeah? - Let's go!

58:58.066 --> 58:59.466
- Of course.

58:59.966 --> 59:00.900
- Hold on.

59:03.566 --> 59:05.366
Do you see what I'm taking about now?

59:06.400 --> 59:08.300
- Mr. Brooks humiliated me, Derek.

59:08.766 --> 59:10.866
You saw it. - Okay.

59:12.633 --> 59:14.266
Is that reason to get him arrested?

59:15.033 --> 59:18.300
- I don't know, but I do know that it's really nice

59:18.366 --> 59:20.066
having someone look out for me.

59:20.100 --> 59:23.366
I thought that you were that person, but I guess that I was wrong.

59:24.566 --> 59:25.533
(scoffs)

59:26.233 --> 59:27.133
- Lily?

59:42.200 --> 59:44.266
(mysterious music)

59:47.133 --> 59:48.433
- Oh my God.

1:00:05.566 --> 1:00:06.733
(giggling)

1:00:06.766 --> 1:00:07.800
Lily?

1:00:07.866 --> 1:00:09.566
- Oh, um, I just...

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:11.266
I'm just coming by to pick up something.

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:14.566
- More clothes? - Uh no, my copy of Zenith.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:16.900
- I have it. - You have it?

1:00:17.566 --> 1:00:20.266
Why do you have it? - I took it.

1:00:20.933 --> 1:00:22.366
- You had no right.

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:24.366
- Violet, I'd like to talk to my daughter alone.

1:00:24.700 --> 1:00:25.533
If you don't mind.

1:00:27.233 --> 1:00:28.966
- No, anything that you want to say to me

1:00:29.033 --> 1:00:30.233
you can say in front of her.

1:00:30.700 --> 1:00:32.233
- No, I can't.

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:39.800
- It's alright, Lily. Take all the time you need.

1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:43.266
I'll be outside waiting whenever you're ready.

1:00:44.766 --> 1:00:47.466
If you need me, just call.

1:00:53.433 --> 1:00:57.200
(door opens and closes)

1:01:01.100 --> 1:01:03.600
- Are you actively trying to ruin my life?

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.433
- It looks like you're doing a pretty good job at that on your own.

1:01:07.466 --> 1:01:09.833
- Oh, so that's why you wanted to talk to me alone,

1:01:09.866 --> 1:01:11.366
so you could insult me?

1:01:13.133 --> 1:01:14.000
- I'm sorry.

1:01:15.166 --> 1:01:17.766
I just... I wanna show you what I found.

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:19.466
Okay, if you could just please sit down?

1:01:20.633 --> 1:01:22.633
Just for a minute.

1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:25.466
- What is it?

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:31.966
- Lily, Harper is not Violet's mother.

1:01:33.166 --> 1:01:34.833
I think she's her sister.

1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:39.666
Her parents were killed in a suspicious camping accident.

1:01:40.366 --> 1:01:42.466
Violet was questioned extensively,

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:44.700
but the police could never explain what really happened.

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:49.533
- Why are you doing this? - What?

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:52.966
- Why are you doing this to me? - What--

1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:55.000
Because it's the truth!

1:01:55.033 --> 1:01:57.366
- No, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!

1:01:57.433 --> 1:01:59.133
I've met Violet's mom!

1:01:59.166 --> 1:02:01.200
- No, Lily, you met her sister.

1:02:03.666 --> 1:02:06.433
Just look at this.

1:02:12.333 --> 1:02:16.000
Lily, please, listen to me. - No, you listen to me.

1:02:16.533 --> 1:02:19.000
I finally have a friend, I have a best friend.

1:02:19.033 --> 1:02:21.833
I finally fit in, and you're trying to take that away from me.

1:02:21.866 --> 1:02:25.100
How dare you?! - No, I'm not trying to take anything away from you,

1:02:25.166 --> 1:02:27.000
I love you! I'm worried about you.

1:02:27.033 --> 1:02:28.900
- No, you're worried about you.

1:02:30.333 --> 1:02:31.533
- What are you saying?

1:02:33.233 --> 1:02:34.833
- You're worried that now that I have people who care about me,

1:02:34.866 --> 1:02:36.733
and believe in me, that you're gonna lose me.

1:02:36.766 --> 1:02:39.266
- No! That couldn't be further from the truth.

1:02:39.333 --> 1:02:40.366
- Oh yeah?

1:02:41.833 --> 1:02:43.566
Because ever since dad died, it's just been you and me.

1:02:44.366 --> 1:02:45.766
And we've always had each other.

1:02:46.333 --> 1:02:48.366
And now that I'm not around as much anymore,

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:52.266
it scares you, so you have to make up lies to hurt me.

1:02:52.333 --> 1:02:54.433
- Lies? Lily, listen to yourself.

1:02:55.233 --> 1:02:56.233
- I am listening.

1:02:57.433 --> 1:03:00.000
See, but I'm done listening to you. Okay?

1:03:02.233 --> 1:03:03.333
Can you just...

1:03:04.633 --> 1:03:06.500
Just leave me alone!

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.166
(door slams)

1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:17.966
(sighs)

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:38.233
(pop music)

1:03:39.166 --> 1:03:40.666
(cheering)

1:03:47.633 --> 1:03:49.433
(laughing)

1:03:49.466 --> 1:03:51.833
(♪)

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:12.400
- Do you like it? - Yeah!

1:04:12.466 --> 1:04:14.500
- It's our secret little hide-out.

1:04:15.166 --> 1:04:16.633
- I love it!

1:04:17.633 --> 1:04:19.466
I can't believe I finally told her off!

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:22.666
You'd be so proud of me! Here.

1:04:23.366 --> 1:04:26.166
Man, you cannot believe the crap that she was saying.

1:04:28.033 --> 1:04:28.966
- Like what?

1:04:30.166 --> 1:04:31.033
- I don't know.

1:04:32.633 --> 1:04:34.200
Hm, she was saying that like...

1:04:35.166 --> 1:04:38.533
Harper is not your mother, she's your sister,

1:04:38.566 --> 1:04:40.533
and that you guys tried to kill your parents.

1:04:40.566 --> 1:04:44.366
Like, crazy stuff! She was putting papers in my face and everything.

1:04:48.133 --> 1:04:49.200
Here.

1:04:51.866 --> 1:04:52.966
I'm good.

1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:56.366
- Trust me, one more at least.

1:05:00.566 --> 1:05:01.966
I need to tell you something, Lily.

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:08.066
(indistinct radio chatter)

1:05:11.300 --> 1:05:13.200
- There you go. - Thank you.

1:05:13.233 --> 1:05:14.733
- You're welcome. - I really appreciate

1:05:14.766 --> 1:05:16.733
you meeting with me so soon.

1:05:16.766 --> 1:05:18.966
- Well, that's the thing about Chestnut Falls,

1:05:19.033 --> 1:05:20.633
we're plenty busy, but when someone comes in

1:05:20.700 --> 1:05:22.866
and says they have information about a murder,

1:05:23.266 --> 1:05:24.133
we listen.

1:05:25.366 --> 1:05:27.266
- I think it's a murder, I can't be certain.

1:05:28.233 --> 1:05:29.700
- Why don't you tell me what you know,

1:05:29.733 --> 1:05:31.300
and we'll figure out what the truth is.

1:05:31.733 --> 1:05:35.266
- Okay. Um, do you remember a case from a few years ago,

1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:39.200
the Lawrence family? The parents died in a camping accident.

1:05:39.233 --> 1:05:41.766
- Yeah, of course, it was big news.

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:44.233
- Did you investigate it? - No, state police did.

1:05:44.266 --> 1:05:46.800
And Department of Parks too I believe,

1:05:46.866 --> 1:05:48.800
after all, it happened in a State park.

1:05:49.300 --> 1:05:51.533
- But the family was from here, Chestnut Falls.

1:05:51.866 --> 1:05:54.066
- Mm-hmm. - In all articles I read,

1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:57.300
it refers to the death as, "A tragic accident."

1:05:57.366 --> 1:05:58.300
- That's right.

1:05:59.733 --> 1:06:02.800
- I don't think it was an accident, Sergeant Carter,

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:04.633
I don't think it was an accident at all.

1:06:04.666 --> 1:06:06.266
I think they were murdered.

1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:09.466
(sombre music)

1:06:19.033 --> 1:06:20.200
- Your mother's not wrong.

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:22.866
Harper is my sister.

1:06:24.366 --> 1:06:26.133
When our parents died,

1:06:26.166 --> 1:06:30.433
she became my legal guardian. She was an adult, it made sense.

1:06:30.866 --> 1:06:33.933
It was easier, less complicated

1:06:33.966 --> 1:06:36.300
to let people think she was my mother.

1:06:37.133 --> 1:06:40.033
And I didn't want anyone's pity. You know how it is.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.366
But that's not what you want to know.

1:06:51.766 --> 1:06:53.033
What you wanna know

1:06:54.166 --> 1:06:56.366
is if I killed my parents.

1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.866
(intense music)

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:04.833
Yes.

1:07:05.666 --> 1:07:07.000
I killed them.

1:07:08.566 --> 1:07:10.400
My parents were very abusive,

1:07:11.233 --> 1:07:13.033
both mentally and physically.

1:07:14.266 --> 1:07:17.900
- The... scar on your side, that wasn't from--

1:07:17.933 --> 1:07:19.000
- A bottle warmer?

1:07:20.233 --> 1:07:21.333
No.

1:07:22.033 --> 1:07:23.500
- I'm so sorry, Violet.

1:07:23.533 --> 1:07:25.200
- But then, Harper gave me this book.

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:27.000
- Zenith.

1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:30.366
- It was exactly what she needed at the time.

1:07:31.366 --> 1:07:36.666
Every night, Harper would read to me from Zenith.

1:07:37.666 --> 1:07:39.600
It was our Bible.

1:07:40.066 --> 1:07:44.900
And slowly, it became obvious what we needed to do.

1:07:45.766 --> 1:07:48.766
- So... she did it.

1:07:49.733 --> 1:07:51.733
She murdered them? - Murder them?

1:07:52.766 --> 1:07:54.866
We just wanted the abuse to stop.

1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:58.066
To live without pain. Without fear.

1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:00.166
- Okay, why didn't you just go tell somebody, like...

1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:03.633
the police? A guidance counsellor?

1:08:03.666 --> 1:08:06.800
- Are you serious, Lily? Come on! You've seen my house.

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:10.266
Do you think anyone would've really believed their spoiled little daughter?

1:08:11.933 --> 1:08:12.966
No.

1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:15.466
- Why are you telling this to me?

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:18.466
Why now? - Because I trust you, Lily.

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:21.000
And you trust Zenith.

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:26.566
But never mention this to anyone.

1:08:27.933 --> 1:08:29.466
Understand?

1:08:30.666 --> 1:08:32.733
- Are you threatening me? - Threatening you?

1:08:33.300 --> 1:08:35.133
Of course not, you're one of us now!

1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:37.233
I'm just explaining.

1:08:37.833 --> 1:08:39.766
And what I'm explaining

1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:43.133
is that if I hear you betray me,

1:08:43.900 --> 1:08:45.733
the things I'll do to you

1:08:45.766 --> 1:08:48.166
will make the pain from that brand of yours

1:08:48.233 --> 1:08:50.300
feel like a little tickle.

1:08:53.066 --> 1:08:54.433
- Violet, I'm--

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.233
I don't know what to think. I'm just...

1:09:00.133 --> 1:09:02.400
I'm just confused. Okay?

1:09:03.066 --> 1:09:05.533
- I never killed anyone I didn't have to.

1:09:07.033 --> 1:09:09.733
It was either them or me.

1:09:10.233 --> 1:09:13.133
And they were killing me slowly, if not physically,

1:09:13.166 --> 1:09:15.033
then both mentally and emotionally.

1:09:15.066 --> 1:09:16.733
Just like your mother is doing to you.

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:17.733
- What?

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:19.133
- Oh, you know it's true, Lily.

1:09:19.166 --> 1:09:20.800
The question is what are you gonna do about it?

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:23.700
- You can't be suggesting that I--

1:09:25.233 --> 1:09:29.033
Violet, I love my mother.

1:09:29.566 --> 1:09:32.166
Yes, obviously, sometimes we fight.

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:33.233
But...

1:09:34.366 --> 1:09:37.133
I would never hurt her.

1:09:37.666 --> 1:09:40.466
I just want... I just want a little space.

1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:42.466
I just want a little freedom.

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:45.300
- Only you know how you feel, Lily.

1:09:46.866 --> 1:09:49.800
But I know once I did what I needed to do,

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:53.033
I finally felt free.

1:09:54.066 --> 1:09:55.366
And that...

1:09:56.733 --> 1:10:00.333
that is the greatest feeling

1:10:02.333 --> 1:10:04.066
in the world.

1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:07.700
(dramatic music)

1:10:09.566 --> 1:10:13.500
- Okay, okay, I hear you, Mrs. Miller, I do. But...

1:10:13.533 --> 1:10:16.466
for me to look into this, let alone reopen the case,

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:19.700
I would need some new evidence. - Okay, like what?

1:10:19.733 --> 1:10:21.400
- Something tangible.

1:10:21.466 --> 1:10:23.833
Something that would prove that the Lawrences didn't just slip

1:10:23.866 --> 1:10:25.466
off an unstable rockfall.

1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:27.866
- Okay, what about proof that the woman that's pretending

1:10:27.900 --> 1:10:31.033
to be Violet Lawrence's mother is really her sister?

1:10:31.566 --> 1:10:33.366
I have articles that prove that.

1:10:33.966 --> 1:10:35.700
- I'm not even sure that's a crime.

1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:39.500
- Excuse me? - It's bizarre, I'll give you that,

1:10:39.533 --> 1:10:41.866
but I wouldn't even know what to charge her with.

1:10:41.900 --> 1:10:44.500
Especially if there's no evidence of neglect or abuse.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.700
- What about brainwashing my daughter?

1:10:46.733 --> 1:10:49.300
- Brainwashing, you mean by giving her that book?

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:50.400
- Yes.

1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:53.333
- Mrs. Miller, I don't want to insult your intelligence,

1:10:53.366 --> 1:10:56.133
but you'd be laughed out of court with that one.

1:10:57.800 --> 1:10:59.666
I doubt a judge would even hear the case.

1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:03.700
- Lily is a different person since she started hanging out with this girl.

1:11:03.733 --> 1:11:05.200
Completely different person.

1:11:05.233 --> 1:11:07.466
She doesn't even listen to me anymore.

1:11:08.066 --> 1:11:10.400
- I get it, I have kids too.

1:11:11.266 --> 1:11:15.133
- What can I do? How can I keep her away from this Violet?

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:16.933
Can I get a restraining order?

1:11:18.366 --> 1:11:19.566
- How old is Lily?

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:23.966
- 18. She just turned 18 a few months ago.

1:11:24.966 --> 1:11:26.200
- Then you can't.

1:11:27.266 --> 1:11:28.533
- I can't what?

1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:31.300
- Can't get her to do what you want, she's legally an adult.

1:11:34.566 --> 1:11:36.766
- Then what do I do, Sergeant Carter,

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:39.766
what do you suggest I do? How do I help my daughter?

1:11:41.566 --> 1:11:44.700
- Look, you said you had a good relationship with her before, right?

1:11:45.700 --> 1:11:47.433
- We were very close, yes.

1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:49.266
- Then talk to her.

1:11:49.766 --> 1:11:51.566
Convince her to listen to you.

1:11:52.033 --> 1:11:54.033
It's the most reasonable thing you could do.

1:11:54.766 --> 1:11:56.233
Frankly, Mrs. Miller,

1:11:56.766 --> 1:11:58.300
it's the only thing you can do.

1:12:00.466 --> 1:12:02.266
(soft music)

1:12:09.333 --> 1:12:11.033
- Mom?!

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:13.833
(panting)

1:12:15.466 --> 1:12:17.600
Did I wake you? - Are you okay?

1:12:17.633 --> 1:12:20.033
- Can we please talk? I'm so sorry!

1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:21.433
- Yes. Come here. - I'm so sorry!

1:12:21.466 --> 1:12:24.800
- Shh, hey, hey, hey, hey, shh.

1:12:24.833 --> 1:12:28.200
It's okay, it's okay.

1:12:28.266 --> 1:12:29.433
Shh, look at me.

1:12:29.466 --> 1:12:31.600
Everything is gonna be okay, I promise.

1:12:33.100 --> 1:12:36.700
Were you with Violet? - No.

1:12:38.033 --> 1:12:39.700
I was just out, trying to clear my head.

1:12:40.766 --> 1:12:41.666
(sighs)

1:12:42.033 --> 1:12:44.200
She had me so messed up.

1:12:44.266 --> 1:12:45.766
Her and her stupid book.

1:12:48.366 --> 1:12:49.600
(sobbing)

1:12:49.633 --> 1:12:51.166
- Do you want to talk about it?

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:55.933
- No.

1:12:57.700 --> 1:12:59.466
Not really, not right now.

1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:04.500
Is that okay? - Yeah, of course.

1:13:08.033 --> 1:13:10.166
- How could I ever make it up to you?

1:13:11.266 --> 1:13:13.700
- Don't worry about me, I'm a mom,

1:13:13.733 --> 1:13:16.333
it comes with the territory. It's okay.

1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:18.033
- Maybe...

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:22.400
Maybe the two of us could hang out this weekend, together?

1:13:24.766 --> 1:13:25.866
- I'd like that.

1:13:27.433 --> 1:13:30.700
- There's this really nice hiking trail up by the mountains.

1:13:30.733 --> 1:13:32.833
All the kids go there at nighttime to hang out,

1:13:32.866 --> 1:13:35.700
but in the day, apparently, it's really beautiful.

1:13:35.733 --> 1:13:37.400
It overlooks the whole valley.

1:13:38.533 --> 1:13:40.033
- Sounds perfect.

1:13:40.433 --> 1:13:41.666
(soft music)

1:13:42.933 --> 1:13:44.266
We should get some sleep.

1:13:45.833 --> 1:13:47.833
- I think that I might just stay here and text my friends.

1:13:48.733 --> 1:13:50.533
Then I'll go to sleep afterwards, is that okay?

1:13:50.566 --> 1:13:52.166
- Yeah, of course.

1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:53.166
Okay.

1:13:55.166 --> 1:13:56.000
Lily?

1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:03.233
I love you. - I love you too.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:05.133
- I'm glad you're back.

1:14:06.266 --> 1:14:07.666
- So am I.

1:14:15.733 --> 1:14:17.966
(♪)

1:14:26.433 --> 1:14:28.266
- Lily, let's go!

1:14:29.633 --> 1:14:31.666
- Okay, okay, I'm coming.

1:14:32.933 --> 1:14:34.466
- You want something to eat?

1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:37.600
- Uh, no, that's okay, I don't really have an appetite.

1:14:37.633 --> 1:14:40.566
- Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. I'll be fine.

1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:42.933
- Okay. That's for you.

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.633
(birds chirping)

1:14:49.333 --> 1:14:51.466
Woo! How are you doing?

1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:53.900
- Tired, but the good kind of tired.

1:14:53.933 --> 1:14:55.600
- Mm, well, do you wanna stop?

1:14:55.633 --> 1:14:58.233
- Before my middle-aged mom, are you kidding?

1:14:58.266 --> 1:15:00.066
- Hey! Don't call me middle-aged!

1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:01.300
(chuckling)

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:06.166
Okay, maybe we just take one little break.

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:07.366
- What? We're almost there!

1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:09.833
I know but... just a little thirsty.

1:15:14.333 --> 1:15:15.966
Whoa, look at these clouds.

1:15:16.366 --> 1:15:18.500
The weather changes on a dime up here.

1:15:20.866 --> 1:15:23.366
Just in case. - Okay.

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:24.533
- You ready? - Yeah.

1:15:24.866 --> 1:15:26.333
(menacing music)

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:29.066
- Oh, be careful! Ooh!

1:15:32.733 --> 1:15:35.400
- Man, I kind of expected today to be a little bit more sunny.

1:15:35.900 --> 1:15:37.333
(chuckling)

1:15:38.866 --> 1:15:41.833
I mean, it's okay, but my boots are gonna be really dirty.

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.633
(indistinct chatter)

1:15:51.566 --> 1:15:53.366
(sombre music)

1:15:54.133 --> 1:15:55.166
- Oh, wow.

1:15:55.833 --> 1:15:57.300
- Look at this branch.

1:15:58.400 --> 1:15:59.900
- Ooh. Nice.

1:16:03.566 --> 1:16:05.733
- I think that we're coming close to...

1:16:05.766 --> 1:16:07.066
(indistinct chatter)

1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:10.233
- Wow. - Look at the ravine.

1:16:10.700 --> 1:16:12.633
It's really something, isn't it, mom?

1:16:17.033 --> 1:16:18.533
(panting)

1:16:24.066 --> 1:16:25.266
Now!

1:16:25.866 --> 1:16:28.200
(screaming)

1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:31.900
- Game over, Violet, game over!

1:16:31.933 --> 1:16:33.600
- I don't know what the hell you're talking about!

1:16:33.633 --> 1:16:35.400
I come up here and meet you like you asked,

1:16:35.433 --> 1:16:37.100
and I get jumped? - Mom!

1:16:37.133 --> 1:16:39.233
- You better have a good explanation for this!

1:16:39.266 --> 1:16:41.400
- I'm sorry, Violet, but it's not gonna work this time.

1:16:41.433 --> 1:16:43.900
- Please! Please! You're all crazy!

1:16:43.933 --> 1:16:45.900
- Listen, you can deny that you killed your parents,

1:16:45.933 --> 1:16:49.233
you can even say that maybe Mr. Brooks is inappropriate,

1:16:49.266 --> 1:16:51.400
but there's one thing that you can't explain.

1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:53.700
(panting)

1:16:53.733 --> 1:16:55.633
- My necklace! Where did you find it?

1:16:55.700 --> 1:16:57.800
- I didn't. Amanda Williams had it.

1:16:57.866 --> 1:17:01.766
- She asked for me at the hospital, so I went.

1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:04.700
She was hazy, but that was something she still remembered,

1:17:04.766 --> 1:17:06.366
is that before the accident,

1:17:06.433 --> 1:17:08.933
she found it beside Jack's truck.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.833
- That's not proof of anything. - Tell that to the police.

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:17.100
- I thought you were special! - I am special!

1:17:17.133 --> 1:17:19.200
I'm just not better than everybody else!

1:17:19.266 --> 1:17:20.533
And neither are you!

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:22.433
(grunting)

1:17:29.933 --> 1:17:30.966
- We did it.

1:17:33.666 --> 1:17:34.500
You're okay?

1:17:35.833 --> 1:17:36.766
Come on.

1:17:38.166 --> 1:17:39.166
(screaming)

1:17:39.466 --> 1:17:41.200
- Uncuff me right now!

1:17:42.033 --> 1:17:44.766
I'm going to sue you! - It's okay.

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:46.833
- I'm going to sue all of you!

1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:50.466
(screaming, panting)

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:54.666
Get me out of here! Lily!

1:17:56.100 --> 1:17:58.500
Lily!

1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:02.500
I love you, Lily!

1:18:02.533 --> 1:18:04.233
- I got the whole thing on my phone.

1:18:04.266 --> 1:18:05.566
I'll email it to you.

1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:07.166
- Good. - And if that doesn't work,

1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.766
there are three witnesses that saw what she attempted to do.

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:12.033
- I'll need you to come down to the station

1:18:12.066 --> 1:18:13.866
and make a formal statement about everything.

1:18:14.833 --> 1:18:16.866
Both of you. - Yeah.

1:18:20.866 --> 1:18:22.166
- Well, maybe it can wait 'til tomorrow.

1:18:22.566 --> 1:18:25.600
Right now, I think you two need to get some rest.

1:18:25.666 --> 1:18:27.000
- Yeah.

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:29.433
- I need to talk to your mother for a few minutes.

1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:31.200
- It's okay, I'll be right there.

1:18:31.733 --> 1:18:32.900
- I'll walk you to your car.

1:18:37.233 --> 1:18:39.400
- Okay, is this the part where you read me riot act

1:18:39.433 --> 1:18:41.733
for endangering the kids? - You could've called me.

1:18:41.766 --> 1:18:44.333
- Because you were so helpful last time.

1:18:45.033 --> 1:18:46.066
- This is different.

1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:49.233
You would've had your daughter to corroborate things.

1:18:49.266 --> 1:18:52.400
- Hmm, yes, then you would've had two crazy ladies instead of one.

1:18:53.233 --> 1:18:55.100
Look, I'm not blaming you, Sergeant,

1:18:55.166 --> 1:18:58.066
but we both know Lily's testimony wouldn't prove anything.

1:18:58.733 --> 1:19:00.233
- It was still risky.

1:19:01.300 --> 1:19:02.766
- Yes, it was risky,

1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:06.166
but if Violet killed multiple people,

1:19:06.233 --> 1:19:08.100
like I am certain she did,

1:19:08.133 --> 1:19:10.800
then it would've been riskier not to do anything.

1:19:12.133 --> 1:19:14.900
I mean, eventually, she would've come after Lily and me.

1:19:14.933 --> 1:19:16.400
She couldn't afford not to.

1:19:19.333 --> 1:19:20.666
So what happens now?

1:19:21.266 --> 1:19:23.100
- Well, it's up to the DA.

1:19:23.133 --> 1:19:24.733
Violet will be charged.

1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:28.100
And they'll have to decide if she's competent to stand trial.

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:31.166
- I don't know if she can stand trial,

1:19:31.233 --> 1:19:36.333
but I do know Violet Lawrence is certainly out of her mind.

1:19:36.833 --> 1:19:39.300
(♪)

1:19:47.066 --> 1:19:49.433
- What do you think school will be like?

1:19:49.466 --> 1:19:51.066
- I don't know.

1:19:51.666 --> 1:19:53.300
We'll have to wait and see.

1:19:55.233 --> 1:19:57.600
- What do you think Ava and Peter are gonna think?

1:19:58.933 --> 1:20:00.266
- Look, they bought into it.

1:20:01.166 --> 1:20:03.133
Just like I did, just like you did.

1:20:04.666 --> 1:20:06.633
But in the end, they're not killers, right?

1:20:07.266 --> 1:20:08.400
They're followers.

1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:11.633
- I just...

1:20:12.966 --> 1:20:14.300
I can't believe that that book inspired us to do

1:20:14.333 --> 1:20:17.133
so many crazy things. - Yeah.

1:20:18.233 --> 1:20:19.166
They didn't seem crazy.

1:20:20.733 --> 1:20:22.133
- I guess so.

1:20:22.166 --> 1:20:23.433
- Do you have the necklace?

1:20:23.466 --> 1:20:24.566
- Mm-hmm.

1:20:28.833 --> 1:20:30.266
- That reminds me.

1:20:31.933 --> 1:20:32.800
(grunts)

1:20:43.633 --> 1:20:44.600
Never again.

1:20:57.800 --> 1:20:58.633
Thanks.

1:20:59.566 --> 1:21:00.966
- Look at the two of you.

1:21:01.366 --> 1:21:02.833
- Hello. - Hi, sir.

1:21:02.866 --> 1:21:04.366
- Will you two relax?

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:06.533
You look like you're guilty of something.

1:21:07.366 --> 1:21:09.400
- I guess it's just being in a police station.

1:21:09.733 --> 1:21:11.966
- Yeah, well, unless you go into law enforcement,

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.566
you probably won't spend too much time in one.

1:21:15.166 --> 1:21:17.566
But with that stunt that the two of you pulled...

1:21:18.666 --> 1:21:21.400
maybe you were made for investigative work.

1:21:26.966 --> 1:21:28.200
(knocking)

1:21:33.466 --> 1:21:34.500
- Hi.

1:21:34.533 --> 1:21:37.166
- Oh, before I forget again.

1:21:41.066 --> 1:21:42.233
- Thank you.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.700
With everything we already have on her...

1:21:46.033 --> 1:21:48.700
we probably don't need this, but it's good to have.

1:21:48.733 --> 1:21:50.233
- Of course.

1:21:51.366 --> 1:21:54.066
- I told your mother I would need to interview her as well.

1:21:54.133 --> 1:21:56.166
I half expected her to be with you.

1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:00.566
- Oh, um... I could give her a call, she could come down.

1:22:00.866 --> 1:22:02.766
- Please. - Yeah.

1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:06.866
(phone ringing)

1:22:06.900 --> 1:22:09.366
- Okay, excuse me, it's my daughter.

1:22:10.233 --> 1:22:11.200
Hello? -Hi, mom.

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.133
- Hi, where are you? - We're with Sergeant Carter.

1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:16.700
- Oh, that's so funny, I'm here with Sergeant Anderson now.

1:22:16.733 --> 1:22:18.366
She came by to take my statement.

1:22:18.933 --> 1:22:19.866
- Oh.

1:22:22.966 --> 1:22:25.700
She says that she's talking to Sergeant Anderson at her house right now.

1:22:26.466 --> 1:22:29.800
- Sergeant Anderson? - Yeah, that's what she said.

1:22:34.633 --> 1:22:36.566
- We don't have a Sergeant Anderson on the force.

1:22:40.566 --> 1:22:42.800
Mrs. Miller, this is Sergeant Carter.

1:22:42.866 --> 1:22:45.133
Please listen to me very carefully.

1:22:45.433 --> 1:22:47.600
That woman is not a police officer.

1:22:47.633 --> 1:22:49.300
She's very dangerous.

1:22:49.366 --> 1:22:51.300
Don't do anything sudden.

1:22:51.366 --> 1:22:52.966
And get out of your house.

1:22:53.033 --> 1:22:54.600
Get out as fast as you can.

1:23:02.966 --> 1:23:05.933
- She just wanted to check up on me.

1:23:07.033 --> 1:23:08.300
- Well, that's good.

1:23:08.966 --> 1:23:10.433
Shall we continue?

1:23:10.466 --> 1:23:13.166
- Yeah. Uh, I don't remember where we were.

1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:14.133
- Hm.

1:23:15.500 --> 1:23:18.166
You were explaining the toxic influence

1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:20.666
the suspect had on your daughter.

1:23:21.700 --> 1:23:23.466
- Oh, right.

1:23:25.100 --> 1:23:26.866
- Easier than blaming the parents, I suppose.

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:31.000
- Excuse me? - Well, all I'm saying is...

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:33.966
you and your daughter just moved here,

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000
Lily has only known the suspect a few weeks,

1:23:36.033 --> 1:23:39.100
you've been her mother, what, over 18 years?

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.133
Seems kind of silly to blame someone else

1:23:41.166 --> 1:23:44.766
for Lily's shortcomings. But what do I know?

1:23:45.500 --> 1:23:46.933
- I'm a good mother.

1:23:48.933 --> 1:23:51.866
- Of course, Mrs. Miller, I didn't mean to imply otherwise.

1:23:55.633 --> 1:23:57.366
- I'm just gonna go get a glass of water.

1:23:58.933 --> 1:24:00.433
(gasps)

1:24:00.833 --> 1:24:02.066
(grunts)

1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:04.533
- I think we should stay right here.

1:24:04.566 --> 1:24:06.400
- Please, please don't hurt me.

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:08.833
Lily needs me.

1:24:10.433 --> 1:24:11.366
- Needs you?

1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:14.566
No, no, I don't think so.

1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:17.166
I think Lily was doing just fine by herself.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.533
In fact, when she was over, she was talking quite a bit

1:24:20.566 --> 1:24:23.033
about how she didn't need you.

1:24:23.066 --> 1:24:24.866
- No, that's not true.

1:24:25.333 --> 1:24:28.766
- Of course, it's true, and you know it.

1:24:30.833 --> 1:24:35.666
- Please, Lily's the only thing that means anything to me.

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:40.033
- Now, now that I believe. But you see, Mrs. Miller,

1:24:40.766 --> 1:24:45.000
that Violet was the one thing that meant something to me

1:24:45.033 --> 1:24:48.866
and you and your little bitch daughter,

1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:50.866
you took her away from me, and now...

1:24:52.433 --> 1:24:53.833
Now, you're gonna pay.

1:24:55.666 --> 1:24:56.600
(screaming)

1:24:58.366 --> 1:24:59.866
(grunting)

1:25:01.833 --> 1:25:03.400
(grunting)

1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.400
Stop! Mrs. Miller.

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:31.966
- Please!

1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:35.466
(gunshot)

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:43.966
- Mom!

1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:47.766
Mom!

1:25:49.766 --> 1:25:51.100
- It's over!

1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:54.900
It's over, I love you. - I love you too.

1:25:54.933 --> 1:25:55.900
(sobbing)

1:26:04.633 --> 1:26:06.966
(heavy breathing)

1:26:15.633 --> 1:26:18.700
- And always remember,

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.700
nobody should be able to keep you here.

1:26:24.033 --> 1:26:25.566
Who are they?!

1:26:27.233 --> 1:26:31.166
Who are they to say that something's wrong with you?!

1:26:32.633 --> 1:26:35.133
They're the ones that should be in here.

1:26:36.466 --> 1:26:38.833
Who don't want you to be free.

1:26:39.900 --> 1:26:43.000
But you have the power to change that.

1:26:44.866 --> 1:26:46.400
You have Zenith.

1:26:47.466 --> 1:26:52.200
And Zenith will set you free.

1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:54.866
Subtitling: difuze
