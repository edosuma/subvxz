<i>Previously on Strike Back.</i>

00:01.730 --> 00:04.833
We have growing evidence that 
your father is stockpiling nuclear triggers.

00:04.868 --> 00:06.135
You'd need to
ask him yourself.

00:06.176 --> 00:07.910
You are a liability, Scott.

00:07.937 --> 00:10.740
Knox is running rings around you,
and I'm the liability?

00:10.775 --> 00:13.710
The goal remains
a strong Africa,

00:13.744 --> 00:17.748
just as America is strong,
and every other nuclear power.

00:19.317 --> 00:21.785
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- It's my way out.

00:21.820 --> 00:25.088
He took out the whole
of your security detail. Hire him.

00:25.122 --> 00:26.956
Take the shot, buddy! 
It's your kill!

00:26.991 --> 00:27.990
Hold fire.

00:28.025 --> 00:30.692
It's loaded with
radioactive materials. Let it go.

00:30.727 --> 00:32.077
We are about
to be deported.

00:32.081 --> 00:35.063
Knox has gone dark. It's time
we went dark, too.

Go. Move.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.747
Here. Put this on.

02:06.642 --> 02:08.795
Let's go.
Here, here.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.180
Let's go.
Go, go, go!

02:14.393 --> 02:15.836
12 o'clock!

02:27.718 --> 02:29.152
Hurry up!

02:48.765 --> 02:50.461
Everyone out!
Move now!

02:52.348 --> 02:53.909
Move on!
Cover me!

03:04.530 --> 03:06.187
Cover!

03:08.246 --> 03:09.808
Go, go!

03:11.234 --> 03:13.091
Come on!

03:31.353 --> 03:33.111
Mr. Lutulu,

03:33.445 --> 03:36.822
Conrad Knox sends
his best wishes.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.781
I thought it was
relatively simple.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.773
As I said, there are still components 
that need to be configured.

03:43.780 --> 03:46.289
It is not a design that I am 
completely familiar with.

03:46.613 --> 03:49.738
Well, how long will it take? I want them
moved north as soon as possible.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.502
48 hours. No more.
I promise.

04:06.073 --> 04:07.564
Here.

04:17.063 --> 04:18.820
<i>Come on, boys.</i>

04:21.180 --> 04:23.534
Walter, my dear,
dear friend.

04:25.231 --> 04:28.216
- Welcome. - Comrade,
 it is good to see you.

04:28.473 --> 04:32.906
- So now our great work can begin.
- It can indeed.

You know what
I don't get?

05:55.041 --> 05:58.601
Why isn't Knox's picture up
on every freaking news channel in the world?

05:58.745 --> 06:01.528
The triggers are one thing, but fully
functioning nukes?

06:01.538 --> 06:04.345
There are no nukes. They were all
decommissioned, remember?

06:04.351 --> 06:06.018
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

06:06.053 --> 06:09.523
But don't you think there should be
an international fucking manhunt or something?

06:11.191 --> 06:13.759
And that may
very well come, Scott,

06:13.793 --> 06:16.462
but right now, we are the
only people looking for him.

06:16.496 --> 06:20.334
And as you may have picked up, we are
persona non grata in South Africa,

06:20.367 --> 06:22.735
and that is why we are running
this operation covertly.

06:22.770 --> 06:26.534
So be in no doubt--cry for help,
nobody's going to come running for us.

06:26.673 --> 06:28.804
Major Sinclair,
we have a lead.

06:29.009 --> 06:32.379
Yes. Detention center
in Harare, Zimbabwe.

06:32.446 --> 06:36.180
Until 7 hours ago, it was home
to this man, Walter Lutulu,

06:36.217 --> 06:38.651
leader of the party
for a democratic Zimbabwe.

06:38.686 --> 06:40.721
Knox is a known supporter.

06:40.788 --> 06:42.889
Someone broke him out
at 2 AM last night.

06:42.923 --> 06:46.059
- That's no small task, is it?
- Hmm. It's a top-tier outfit.

06:46.093 --> 06:50.037
- What, are you thinking Matlock?
- Well, according to intelligence sources in Harare,

06:50.064 --> 06:51.972
the breakout crew
left a man behind.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.868
He's been identified
as Sebastien Boucher,

06:54.902 --> 06:59.501
an ex-foreign legion merc who's been on 
Matlock's payroll since the abduction of Evans.

06:59.505 --> 07:01.541
Where Lutulu
has been taken and why,

07:01.576 --> 07:03.911
and the connection with the
WMD has yet to be determined.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.099
But right now it's the
only lead we've got.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.215
Lutulu has
a daughter--Lilian.

07:08.483 --> 07:10.417
He made contact
two hours ago.

07:10.651 --> 07:13.587
<i>Lily... it's me.</i>

07:13.654 --> 07:16.158
That's an intercept of Walter Lutulu's
voiceprint.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.158
<i>I can't talk long.</i>

07:18.492 --> 07:20.928
<i>Someone will come
and bring you to me.</i>

07:21.563 --> 07:23.791
<i>It will be safe for you
to do what they say.</i>

07:24.265 --> 07:25.867
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

07:26.301 --> 07:28.603
The voice in the
background could be Knox,

07:28.690 --> 07:31.860
now, we can't trace the source of the call,
but we do know where it went to.

07:32.074 --> 07:36.511
<i>Lilian runs a law center
for Zimbabwean refugees in Bukhoma--</i>

07:36.546 --> 07:38.681
<i>a township 3 miles
from here.</i>

07:38.915 --> 07:42.786
<i>Chances are one of Knox's crew
will be making the pickup.</i>

07:43.120 --> 07:45.888
<i>Your job is to track
and report back.</i>

07:46.023 --> 07:47.656
<i>Knox is mission priority.</i>

07:47.691 --> 07:52.190
<i>We play our cards right, Lutulu's 
daughter could lead us right to him.</i>

07:53.297 --> 07:54.832
There she is.

07:57.702 --> 07:59.136
Got her.

08:04.409 --> 08:06.739
- She's hot.
- Very.

08:08.013 --> 08:11.050
She's not just a pretty face.
She's Harvard-educated.

08:11.182 --> 08:13.953
Could have had a stellar career 
at the UN. But decided to come home

08:13.985 --> 08:16.021
and work for
her father's cause.

08:16.755 --> 08:20.609
Don't worry. Your children will not
be put out onto the streets.

08:20.726 --> 08:23.089
- I'll see you later.
- Ok. See you later.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.273
Reckon she...
might date a soldier?

08:26.398 --> 08:28.700
I think you'd need an IQ
in double digits, mate.

08:28.767 --> 08:30.567
Counts you out,
buddy.

08:44.348 --> 08:46.104
The Musina contingent.

08:47.419 --> 08:50.321
They'll be on the Limpopo
River by nightfall.

08:50.456 --> 08:56.155
Good. Well, the rest of the equipment
will be with you in a couple of days.

08:58.998 --> 09:02.038
Excellent.
Bring her straight here.

09:07.940 --> 09:12.144
Lilian will be with us shortly. My men
are just moving into the township now.

09:12.178 --> 09:14.012
I can't wait
to see her.

09:14.246 --> 09:17.314
She's doing sterling work 
with the refugee community.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.617
Whipping up support
for the party. Please, sit.

09:21.287 --> 09:23.720
- I see you have
been busy yourself. - Oh, yes.

09:23.756 --> 09:25.724
My plans
are well advanced.

09:26.159 --> 09:29.093
Good, because
we must be quick.

09:29.228 --> 09:33.762
A leader in exile commands little respect.
How many men do you have?

09:33.799 --> 09:37.636
- Mr. Matlock, how many men
do we have? - Over 800.

09:38.638 --> 09:40.338
All special forces
trained.

09:40.373 --> 09:43.100
One team are already in Zimbabwe, 
another two on the border,

09:43.176 --> 09:44.944
a third on their way.

09:45.478 --> 09:47.111
I'm holding 50 back.

09:47.146 --> 09:49.447
So, what's the situation
with you and the army?

09:49.515 --> 09:52.000
Two of the generals
are old friends.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.018
I am assured
of their support.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.355
- Do you trust them? - We fought 
together in the war for independence.

09:57.689 --> 09:59.690
I trust them with my life.

10:02.093 --> 10:03.961
- Hi.
- Good morning, Lilian.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.432
Target on the move.

10:15.275 --> 10:17.042
Heads up. 12 o'clock.

10:17.977 --> 10:19.277
Got it.

10:21.847 --> 10:23.448
Do you think
that's her contact?

10:23.516 --> 10:25.902
They certainly don't look like
Matlock's boys, do they?

10:26.052 --> 10:29.686
- Someone should probably
go and take a closer look, huh? - Yeah.

10:29.722 --> 10:31.852
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:32.891 --> 10:34.259
You probably should
get out there.

10:36.328 --> 10:39.163
Fuck. You wanted to get
out from behind the desk.

10:39.197 --> 10:44.398
Yeah. Well, it beats sitting in an office
writing your paychecks.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.903
All right.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.972
Try and blend in, Sinclair.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.276
What do you call that look?
Gangster Gilligan?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.846
I think Dalton dressed him.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.691
They've got comms
and a file on Lilian.

11:06.725 --> 11:08.293
<i>What do you
want me to do?</i>

11:09.328 --> 11:12.965
Do not engage unless absolutely
necessary, Bravo Team.

11:13.199 --> 11:15.333
<i>This is a
surveillance operation only.</i>

11:21.574 --> 11:23.608
All right, that looks
like it's gonna go live.

11:26.178 --> 11:27.545
Hang on, bud.

11:29.681 --> 11:31.915
Zimbabwean intelligence.
Please come with us.

11:32.049 --> 11:33.618
I don't think so.

11:34.052 --> 11:35.753
I said come with us.

11:37.756 --> 11:39.423
What the
hell is he doing?

11:39.757 --> 11:41.425
Ah! Take your hands
off me.

11:41.459 --> 11:43.260
He's going to
get himself killed.

11:43.294 --> 11:45.229
Brother, please,
I am hungry.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.331
Leave him alone!

11:47.365 --> 11:48.398
I am just hungry.

11:48.432 --> 11:49.433
I said
leave him alone.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.134
You've got
no right--

11:51.169 --> 11:53.003
I warned you.
Back off.

11:53.537 --> 11:54.838
Run!

11:55.272 --> 11:56.839
Move, move!

12:03.614 --> 12:05.181
Sinclair,
down, down!

12:06.183 --> 12:08.413
- Bravo, get out of there now!
- Shit.

12:08.452 --> 12:09.385
- You all right?
- She's gone.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.300
- Get the fuck off my car.
- Let's go! Let's move!

12:11.321 --> 12:13.690
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

12:14.724 --> 12:16.158
Let's go!

12:24.267 --> 12:26.435
It's me. I know
where the girl is.

12:26.469 --> 12:28.204
<i>You know
what to do.</i>

12:30.674 --> 12:34.177
This was supposed to be
a stealth operation.

12:36.413 --> 12:38.014
Low-key.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.617
Sorry. We didn't have
much of a choice.

12:40.651 --> 12:43.053
You manage to keep
a track on Lilian?

12:43.387 --> 12:45.914
I'm afraid we lost her.
 She disappeared into the township,

12:45.957 --> 12:47.995
and that place is
like a rabbit warren.

12:48.026 --> 12:50.728
There is a chance that
she was injured in the attack.

12:51.762 --> 12:54.432
Yeah. If it wasn't for Rambo here,
she'd probably be dead.

12:55.299 --> 12:58.067
Well, I think the
shooters were Zimbabwean.

12:58.101 --> 13:00.203
From what I could hear,
they were talking in Shona.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.105
What? Secret police?

13:02.139 --> 13:04.240
Revenge attack for
Walter Lutulu's escape?

13:04.275 --> 13:07.043
Well, if we're right and Lutulu
is a catalyst for dissent,

13:07.078 --> 13:10.447
then we could be looking at
the beginning of a coup.

13:10.482 --> 13:12.449
Walter Lutulu with nukes?

13:12.483 --> 13:15.953
He's no hawk. I mean, he spent the
last decade agitating for democracy.

13:16.020 --> 13:19.288
He was a freedom fighter once.
Fought alongside Mugabe.

13:19.324 --> 13:21.601
Nukes or not, they
will need outside help

13:21.625 --> 13:23.227
if they're going to make
a move on Zimbabwe.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.368
- Help from who?
- Let's start with the CIA.

13:26.398 --> 13:28.758
Elements within the administration
have been banging on for years

13:28.760 --> 13:30.588
about the Chinese
taking over Africa.

13:30.603 --> 13:33.304
Zimbabwe up for grabs?
They'd definitely want a piece.

13:33.338 --> 13:36.340
Let Knox do the dirty work
and then move in.

13:36.374 --> 13:39.742
- Right. Scott, a word.
- Yeah.

13:42.681 --> 13:45.449
We've identified
6 key figures--

13:45.583 --> 13:48.252
hard-liners
in the Politburo.

13:48.386 --> 13:50.455
With those out
of the way...

13:51.389 --> 13:54.158
We have assassins
on stand-by, Mr. Lutulu,

13:54.192 --> 13:57.495
ready to strike at the first
stage of the assault.

13:59.097 --> 14:03.167
Some of these men
are old comrades.

14:03.202 --> 14:05.604
I had hoped
to turn them around.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.340
A bloodless coup?

14:08.607 --> 14:10.942
Ballots, not bullets.

14:10.976 --> 14:14.276
Some of those same men
would have seen you hanged, Walter.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.915
If I hadn't moved when I did,
you'd be dead already.

14:20.453 --> 14:23.788
What must be done
must be done.

14:23.823 --> 14:27.693
But I do not want unnecessary
deaths on my conscience.

14:27.807 --> 14:30.996
Power bought with blood
will stain us all.

14:40.307 --> 14:44.044
Papa, I can hardly
believe it's true.

14:48.983 --> 14:50.383
Papa.

14:50.517 --> 14:52.018
Mr. Knox.

14:53.454 --> 14:55.187
There were Zimbabwean
Military Intelligence,

14:55.222 --> 14:58.125
CIO, in the township,
looking to arrest her.

14:59.659 --> 15:03.707
So the regime is striking out 
already. Did you stop them?

15:03.763 --> 15:07.401
I didn't need to. Section 20
did that for me. They were already there.

15:07.433 --> 15:08.800
Are you certain?

15:08.868 --> 15:13.004
100%. I recognized
Stonebridge and Scott.

15:13.338 --> 15:17.105
Get me Dreyer on the phone.
He assured me they'd been dealt with.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.518
You, uh, fishing
for information?

15:27.953 --> 15:28.954
I see what
you did there.

15:28.988 --> 15:30.945
- Good, huh?
- No.

15:30.957 --> 15:32.090
It's clever?

15:32.125 --> 15:34.905
If I'm not back in 10 minutes, 
then call the coast guard.

15:42.803 --> 15:44.571
You missed
feeding time.

15:45.308 --> 15:46.816
I'm not hungry.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.244
I heard about
the Mossad agent--

15:51.511 --> 15:53.146
Rebecca Levi.

15:53.780 --> 15:56.847
- What about her?
- True you couldn't kill her?

15:58.018 --> 15:59.687
Not couldn't.

16:00.721 --> 16:02.355
Just wouldn't.

16:02.389 --> 16:04.423
Redemption
in a bullet.

16:05.992 --> 16:07.960
Yeah, something like that.

16:09.596 --> 16:11.564
She was looking
for a way out.

16:11.598 --> 16:14.007
She's not
the only one.

16:14.401 --> 16:16.102
No shit.

16:21.809 --> 16:23.510
I want to go home.

16:26.513 --> 16:28.948
I need you to clean
my record, Christy.

16:33.887 --> 16:37.356
20 is tracking weapons of
mass destruction, right?

16:38.625 --> 16:40.227
Who are you
targeting?

16:41.861 --> 16:46.305
Conrad Knox, but you
already know that.

16:46.532 --> 16:51.067
He was behind that jailbreak
 in Zimbabwe that freed Walter Lutulu.

16:53.073 --> 16:55.408
Can you tell me
where Knox is?

16:55.942 --> 16:59.545
Ha. Dalton tell you
to ask me that?

16:59.979 --> 17:02.014
You are working
for the wrong woman.

17:03.516 --> 17:05.818
Yeah, I know that.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.208
If you really do
want to go home,

17:14.093 --> 17:16.028
there will be
a price to pay.

17:16.561 --> 17:18.329
You do understand
that?

17:20.967 --> 17:22.500
Yeah.

17:32.279 --> 17:35.612
There's no sign of Lilian. Knox 
must have got her out of there by now.

17:35.849 --> 17:37.749
Or she could have
gone to ground.

17:40.086 --> 17:42.002
Major, we have
a security breach.

17:44.191 --> 17:46.058
Shit.
It's Dreyer.

17:46.093 --> 17:47.727
How the hell did he find us?

17:47.738 --> 17:49.928
- Lock the systems down immediately.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:50.097 --> 17:51.998
Contact
Stonebridge and Scott.

17:55.336 --> 17:57.103
I need one minute.

18:00.541 --> 18:04.309
<i>Bravo Team, the crib
is under immediate threat. It's Dreyer.</i>

18:04.311 --> 18:06.412
Roger that.
Scott, let's move! Go.

18:06.746 --> 18:08.080
Let's go.

18:10.249 --> 18:12.550
Mr. Dreyer,
I can explain.

18:12.585 --> 18:14.985
You were supposed
to be on a plane home.

18:15.120 --> 18:19.955
Instead, you're sending black operatives
 into the townships and killing people.

18:20.558 --> 18:23.122
I'm charging you with crimes
against the Republic of South Africa.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.832
I understand that we've been sailing
fairly close to the wind--

18:25.897 --> 18:27.799
Get them out of here.

18:28.133 --> 18:29.667
Get your hands off me.

18:31.804 --> 18:36.438
Thanks to you, we have a major diplomatic incident on our hands with Zimbabwe.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.512
{\an8}Lockdown completed

18:38.544 --> 18:40.512
You had your chance
to leave.

18:40.546 --> 18:44.050
What happens now
is of your own making.

18:44.884 --> 18:45.818
Get them out.

18:45.852 --> 18:47.052
Come on, out!

18:47.087 --> 18:48.186
You know
where to take them.

18:48.221 --> 18:50.522
Move your ass.
Go! Move!

18:50.690 --> 18:52.824
I don't want
to talk about that now.

18:52.859 --> 18:55.126
Ok. I'll just accept it.
You have a boyfriend.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.258
Ha! You
can't ask me that.

18:58.292 --> 19:00.127
What do you mean,
I can't ask you, eh?

19:00.462 --> 19:02.196
I'm allowed to ask you things.
I'm your father.

19:02.264 --> 19:04.065
Papa, believe me.

19:08.371 --> 19:10.939
News of your escape
has filtered out.

19:10.973 --> 19:14.077
The regime tried to suppress it,
but they couldn't hold that news for long.

19:14.144 --> 19:15.678
Then neither must I.

19:15.712 --> 19:18.214
The people will be anxious
to know that I am ok.

19:18.248 --> 19:20.382
You could announce your
return in Bukhoma.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.751
There's an army of activists
already in place.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.853
I could prepare them
for your appearance.

19:24.888 --> 19:26.588
Harness social media.

19:26.656 --> 19:28.390
Facebook. Twitter.

19:28.425 --> 19:32.200
Look, a public appearance now
could be quite dangerous. You know that.

19:32.229 --> 19:35.966
A leader cannot command respect
from behind the shadows.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.035
Believe me, if my people
thought that I was afraid,

19:39.269 --> 19:41.137
they would never
follow me.

19:53.652 --> 19:55.352
Get the fuck
off me!

20:06.365 --> 20:07.631
Sinclair.

20:11.703 --> 20:13.438
On your feet, boet.

20:18.209 --> 20:20.177
Where
the fuck is Dreyer?

20:25.282 --> 20:28.684
I demand you put me in touch
with my legal representation.

20:28.819 --> 20:31.954
Another word, and I'll put you
in touch with your ancestors.

20:32.422 --> 20:34.190
Fokken whore.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.927
Come on.

20:54.010 --> 20:57.680
How is Walter?
Ready for his inauguration?

20:58.014 --> 21:01.016
He's more eager to seize
power than I anticipated.

21:01.117 --> 21:03.085
He knows about
the nuclear weapons?

21:03.319 --> 21:06.555
Not yet, no.
I haven't found the right moment.

21:07.589 --> 21:10.026
Did you know his daughter
has been in contact

21:10.060 --> 21:13.229
with the same army factions
that support her father?

21:14.263 --> 21:18.950
If the regime had killed Walter,
the opposition

21:19.000 --> 21:22.369
planned to install her
as the front runner to the CDZ.

21:23.373 --> 21:24.974
Charming girl.

21:25.308 --> 21:26.875
You've met her?

21:27.210 --> 21:28.944
I made it my mission.

21:29.379 --> 21:31.847
Today's activist is
tomorrow's leader.

21:31.982 --> 21:33.949
She knows who
her friends are.

21:33.984 --> 21:36.218
How does she feel about that?
Do you know?

21:36.252 --> 21:38.321
She shares
her father's steel.

21:39.255 --> 21:42.023
The Lutulus are a true
political dynasty.

21:43.426 --> 21:45.693
You'd do well
to remember that.

22:00.775 --> 22:02.343
Fuck.

22:02.778 --> 22:05.817
- Do you think this is Knox?
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure of it.

22:05.848 --> 22:07.915
We need to get
after that bastard.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.951
But without the crib,
we're limited.

22:15.258 --> 22:19.259
Julia, I've got the core software
on a portable drive.

22:19.295 --> 22:24.209
We'd have limited functionality, but we could be
operational if we had a couple of laptops.

22:37.345 --> 22:38.345
Fuck.

22:38.379 --> 22:39.780
Shit.

22:40.348 --> 22:41.581
Clear.

22:47.655 --> 22:49.289
It's me.

22:49.323 --> 22:50.758
Are you sure?

22:51.592 --> 22:53.028
Are you sure?

22:54.163 --> 22:55.331
Yeah.

22:55.365 --> 22:58.204
- What? - Our contact has 
no record of any arrests.

22:58.209 --> 23:00.901
- Bullshit. - Dreyer could have had 
them taken fucking anywhere.

23:01.066 --> 23:03.173
- Let's go find them.
- Yeah, let's do that.

23:40.314 --> 23:42.580
- Boss.
- Fuck off.

24:30.498 --> 24:31.598
How did you
find me?

24:31.632 --> 24:34.434
Oh, come on.
Every slug leaves a trail.

24:34.468 --> 24:36.170
Where are they? Huh?

24:36.504 --> 24:38.639
Where the fuck
are they?

24:43.478 --> 24:45.713
Some people have arrived
from your embassy.

24:45.947 --> 24:47.348
Really?

24:48.951 --> 24:50.518
What are
their names?

24:52.188 --> 24:54.056
You'll be taken
to see them.

24:59.229 --> 25:01.364
First we have to
process you--

25:01.432 --> 25:03.721
one by one.

25:05.336 --> 25:06.569
Come!

25:08.338 --> 25:10.406
Could you
take off the handcuffs?

25:10.540 --> 25:13.201
Come on. I'm no threat. I'm not even
a field operative.

25:13.343 --> 25:18.744
If it was up to me, coffer, you'd be 
in shackles--ball and chain. Move.

25:24.454 --> 25:25.988
Sinclair.

25:28.291 --> 25:29.925
We're getting
out of here.

25:41.838 --> 25:43.739
They're not answering.

25:43.774 --> 25:46.075
- Who are we up against?
- I don't know.

25:47.211 --> 25:50.185
Try again. I have no fucking qualms
about putting a bullet in you.

25:50.214 --> 25:51.849
Try again.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.884
I don't know.
I just make a call.

25:53.918 --> 25:55.953
Mercs? Cops? Who?

25:55.987 --> 25:57.814
They're former
Recces.

25:58.189 --> 26:00.989
South African mercenaries.
Freelancers.

26:26.117 --> 26:27.851
What is this place?

26:30.655 --> 26:34.356
If this place had a name,
then it would exist.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.762
I'm a major
in the British Army.

26:39.698 --> 26:43.265
There are clear guidelines
about the treatment of prisoners.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.372
What about the execution
of prisoners?

26:52.945 --> 26:54.579
It's a trap!

27:07.992 --> 27:09.760
Do you have
children?

27:10.194 --> 27:11.595
Yes.

27:52.435 --> 27:55.869
- What have you done with Sinclair?
- You'll see him just now.

27:56.039 --> 27:57.440
Up.

27:58.074 --> 27:59.741
Up now!

28:09.219 --> 28:10.687
Move.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.444
That's far enough.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.008
Well, could you
remove my cuffs?

28:44.122 --> 28:48.457
I don't want to greet the embassy officials
looking like a common criminal.

28:49.628 --> 28:52.630
Why not?
That's what you are.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.817
Major! Give me the weapon.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.420
Take that.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.657
Did you see Sinclair?

29:20.860 --> 29:23.167
- You. Baxter!
- Yeah!

29:23.196 --> 29:24.962
- This way! - Roger that.
- Go!

29:43.284 --> 29:44.817
Go, go, go!

30:03.336 --> 30:05.070
I'm out!

30:08.107 --> 30:09.440
I'm out!

30:09.475 --> 30:10.742
Shit!

30:47.983 --> 30:49.457
Give me that.

31:47.109 --> 31:48.976
Knox ordered this.

31:51.446 --> 31:54.014
It's not over until
we get that son of a bitch.

31:55.817 --> 31:58.152
Wow.
How did we find this place?

31:58.186 --> 32:01.857
You know how it is. A friend of Dalton's
who used to work on the circuit.

32:02.124 --> 32:05.791
Made some extra cash, bought this 
as a cover business, and then it went bust.

32:05.827 --> 32:07.994
- Richmond, have you got picture?
- Nothing.

32:08.797 --> 32:10.230
Good security,
dickhead.

32:10.265 --> 32:13.032
- What about now?
- Yeah. We're up.

32:16.439 --> 32:18.605
- Here.
- Thanks.

32:19.108 --> 32:22.008
- How did we do?
- All right. Ammo, weapons.

32:22.412 --> 32:23.959
Not enough to go
to war.

32:23.963 --> 32:25.646
- You all right?
- Yeah.

32:25.916 --> 32:28.284
Before we do that,
come here.

32:28.351 --> 32:31.151
- Richmond, Baxter.
- Yeah.

32:36.759 --> 32:38.159
Here.

32:53.376 --> 32:54.776
To Oliver.

32:55.911 --> 32:58.146
To an exemplary
soldier.

32:58.380 --> 33:00.381
An honored friend.

33:02.150 --> 33:05.606
I didn't know Major
Sinclair like you all did,

33:06.621 --> 33:08.790
but he died
on my watch,

33:10.524 --> 33:12.492
trying to save
our lives...

33:14.128 --> 33:16.089
And that makes it
personal.

33:16.103 --> 33:18.131
You're damn right
it's fucking personal.

33:18.165 --> 33:21.000
What we do from here
on in, we do in his name.

33:21.035 --> 33:22.903
To Major Sinclair.

33:23.037 --> 33:24.488
Major Sinclair.
Major Sinclair.

33:24.492 --> 33:25.939
To Major Sinclair.

33:58.639 --> 34:01.241
I'm sorry, sir, but you're
not allowed in here.

34:52.192 --> 34:56.504
Ok. We have basic
sat-feed and some comms.

34:56.547 --> 34:58.184
Looks like
we're in business.

34:58.198 --> 35:01.167
Ma'am, we have
activity at the law center.

35:01.202 --> 35:02.502
Is Lilian back?

35:02.536 --> 35:04.800
Haven't seen her, but
there's a lot of traffic coming in and out.

35:04.839 --> 35:06.606
Maybe we should break in
tonight and have a look.

35:06.641 --> 35:08.241
- No need.
- What?

35:08.276 --> 35:10.210
I don't know
where Lutulu is,

35:10.244 --> 35:12.178
but he's going
to be in Bukhoma.

35:12.213 --> 35:13.880
It's all over
Twitter.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.017
Perfect.

35:27.128 --> 35:29.263
You weren't meant
to see these...

35:29.697 --> 35:33.231
- Not yet, anyway. - So when
was I supposed to see them?

35:33.267 --> 35:35.570
At the march-past
in a victory parade?

35:36.705 --> 35:38.906
Well, I haven't got these
weapons to take power--

35:38.940 --> 35:40.975
simply to help us
hold on to it.

35:41.043 --> 35:43.078
Our task--
yours and mine--

35:43.612 --> 35:47.114
is to give Africa what
it's always been denied--strength.

35:47.317 --> 35:50.752
You want to turn Zimbabwe
into a nuclear power?

35:50.887 --> 35:53.820
No. The world we live in, you can't negotiate 
from a position of weakness.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.691
I thought you would
understand that.

35:55.725 --> 35:58.760
I want to repair relations with
the international community.

35:59.094 --> 36:04.229
I want to see sanctions lifted,
not to turn us into a pariah state!

36:04.266 --> 36:06.869
- L-listen, Walter. We have a deal.
- Not for this!

36:06.902 --> 36:10.170
I've risked a lot
to get these weapons.

36:11.239 --> 36:15.340
They're my gift to you,
along with Zimbabwe itself.

36:15.943 --> 36:18.879
What makes you think that
it is within your power

36:20.047 --> 36:21.915
to give me
my own country?

36:21.949 --> 36:23.716
I liberated you.
I set you free.

36:23.751 --> 36:26.285
To do what?
To take control of our resources?

36:26.320 --> 36:28.821
Our gold mines, our
diamonds, our uranium?

36:28.855 --> 36:29.956
No.

36:29.990 --> 36:33.494
You have already spoken of taking 
control of the mining franchise.

36:33.526 --> 36:38.030
Yes, to put the money back into the economy,
where it belongs, not into my pocket.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.433
I have more money than I can
spend in a dozen lifetimes,

36:41.467 --> 36:44.650
and a great deal of it has
gone into financing this coup.

36:44.664 --> 36:47.073
The key element
of this coup

36:47.608 --> 36:51.611
is military backing,
and I already have that.

36:56.950 --> 36:58.251
Walter!

36:58.385 --> 36:59.720
Walter!

36:59.954 --> 37:03.423
Walter, please.
Walter, please.

37:03.558 --> 37:05.626
I know you're upset,
and I'm sorry.

37:06.361 --> 37:09.430
I should have been upfront
with you from the start.

37:09.698 --> 37:13.168
Those weapons need never
leave the hangar.

37:13.602 --> 37:16.536
Now look. Stay here.
Make your speech at Bukhoma.

37:16.558 --> 37:19.875
The people are expecting you.
You can't let them down now.

37:20.442 --> 37:23.276
Very well. But whatever you do,
comrade,

37:24.346 --> 37:25.980
never patronize me.

37:26.614 --> 37:30.288
We can only be partners if we can agree
the right way forward

37:31.353 --> 37:33.353
for my country.

38:19.070 --> 38:21.039
Richmond,
you getting this?

38:23.976 --> 38:25.810
Clean and clear.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.948
And Knox?

38:31.818 --> 38:33.653
No, nothing yet.

38:37.056 --> 38:39.091
Stick
with the Lutulus.

38:39.326 --> 38:41.426
Knox is clearly
invested in them.

39:09.088 --> 39:11.890
Friends and Zimbabweans,

39:12.225 --> 39:14.225
it's time for change!

39:17.596 --> 39:19.396
For new heroes!

39:20.998 --> 39:27.500
And there is no one who has fought harder
to bring freedom to our beloved land than my father,

39:27.772 --> 39:30.566
your friend,
our hero,

39:31.243 --> 39:33.344
Walter Lutulu!

39:44.523 --> 39:47.092
Thank you,
my brothers and sisters.

39:47.126 --> 39:51.461
Thank you, my daughter,
for your kind, if overgenerous words.

39:52.198 --> 39:54.099
But let me say this.

39:54.634 --> 39:58.003
There are no heroes
on this platform.

40:00.507 --> 40:05.245
But before me, I see
hundreds of heroes.

40:06.981 --> 40:09.549
And tomorrow
there will be thousands.

40:10.752 --> 40:13.253
And the day after that, there
will be one million heroes!

40:16.524 --> 40:19.493
Because when we lose
our fear,

40:19.927 --> 40:22.228
we find our freedom!

40:24.698 --> 40:29.601
For now we demand the right
to live free of fear...

40:30.205 --> 40:33.706
Free of oppression...
The right to dignity and democracy...

40:33.775 --> 40:35.944
Yes!
Yes!

40:36.011 --> 40:38.800
The right to hope, not hate!

40:42.117 --> 40:44.185
Get down! A weapon!

40:47.923 --> 40:49.590
Christ. They've shot him.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.363
Get down!

40:56.398 --> 40:59.531
- We've got a shooter! - Bravos,
stay with the Lutulus.

40:59.601 --> 41:02.134
- Provide whatever
assistance you can. - Yeah. Right.

41:06.441 --> 41:07.674
Shit.

41:07.709 --> 41:08.675
Move!

41:08.710 --> 41:10.300
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

41:10.378 --> 41:11.511
Mike, you got
anything?

41:11.545 --> 41:13.780
Be careful. Be careful.

41:16.450 --> 41:18.318
Zero, I've got eyes
on target!

41:19.153 --> 41:22.502
Do not--
I repeat, do not terminate.

41:23.257 --> 41:25.523
- Quick! Quick!
- Excuse me. Move!

41:25.559 --> 41:26.793
Be careful with him!

41:26.830 --> 41:29.163
Get him on there.
Get him on that truck.

41:30.397 --> 41:32.398
Come on. Move, move, move!

41:32.532 --> 41:34.200
Come on. Move.

41:35.735 --> 41:37.702
- He is the killer!
- No!

41:37.770 --> 41:40.104
- He is the killer!
- Put your fucking gun down.

41:40.206 --> 41:43.277
I can help you, all right?
I can help.

41:55.188 --> 41:56.589
Shit.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.924
Zero, I need some
help here.

41:58.958 --> 42:01.325
We have eyes
in the sky available. Come on.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.905
Bravo Two, the target seems
to be heading north.

42:05.029 --> 42:08.032
Fuck! We've lost
signal.

42:08.666 --> 42:09.700
Shit.

42:09.734 --> 42:11.808
Bravo Two, I'm sorry.
You're on your own.

42:13.904 --> 42:15.705
It's ok. Ok.

42:15.939 --> 42:17.340
He's the killer!
He's the killer!

42:17.374 --> 42:19.675
Put the gun down. I'm not a threat.
I'm not a threat. I'm trying to help you.

42:19.710 --> 42:22.471
I'm trained in
battlefield surgery. Thank you.

42:22.713 --> 42:24.213
I've got to have
a look.

42:29.620 --> 42:30.953
Fuck.

42:37.095 --> 42:39.997
Whoa! Hey, hey. Stop.
Stop. Put that down.

42:43.769 --> 42:46.069
- What's that?
- It's a clotting agent.- Papa!

42:46.104 --> 42:47.839
It'll help
stem the blood.

42:48.173 --> 42:51.674
Try and get us to the
nearest fucking hospital! Come on!

42:57.215 --> 42:58.548
Oi. Fuck.

43:14.032 --> 43:16.569
Hey. You were with Knox, yeah?
Conrad Knox.

43:16.703 --> 43:18.804
Did you see any weapons?
Nuclear weapons?

43:18.839 --> 43:21.803
- What are you talking about?! - Please calm
down. I've got to ask him that question.

43:21.842 --> 43:23.905
- Just help him!
- I'm trying to do the best I can.

43:23.944 --> 43:27.046
Please. Stay calm.
I'm not a fucking doctor.

43:27.280 --> 43:30.647
Just keep your hand there.
Get us to that hospital right now!

43:45.532 --> 43:48.301
Hey, where's my car? Huh?
You said there would be a car here!

43:48.316 --> 43:50.737
Look. Yeah.
He's there. Look.

43:56.110 --> 43:59.578
This is the guy that killed Walter Lutulu!
He's all yours now!

44:11.392 --> 44:14.093
- Zero, how badly
do you want this guy? - Badly.

44:14.128 --> 44:16.196
Yeah, I thought
you'd say that. Shit.

44:25.138 --> 44:28.574
Stop. Stop.
Back off. Back off.

44:29.008 --> 44:30.876
Back off! Back off!

44:31.010 --> 44:34.112
You! Back the fuck off.
Back off right now.

44:35.314 --> 44:37.611
Back off!
I said back off.

44:38.651 --> 44:40.588
Stand up. Oi!
Stand up.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.457
This way. Come here.
This way.

44:45.692 --> 44:47.093
Back.

44:50.997 --> 44:53.531
Whatever Knox is planning,
it is definitely starting here.

44:55.068 --> 44:56.369
Come here.

45:05.579 --> 45:06.947
Zero.

45:06.981 --> 45:08.449
Fuck!

45:08.883 --> 45:10.284
Fuck.

45:10.318 --> 45:13.520
Ok, move. Let's move forward.
Come on.

45:21.730 --> 45:22.763
Papa!

45:22.798 --> 45:24.864
- Medic! I need a fucking medic!
- Help my father, please!

45:24.900 --> 45:27.861
- Doctor. I need a doctor!
- My father!

45:27.903 --> 45:32.607
Are you a doctor? Get out of there.
Come here! You. Over here!

45:32.642 --> 45:36.010
Quickly! Father, stay with me.
- Who's the fucking doctor? You?

45:36.079 --> 45:38.232
- Yes.
- Don't leave me!

45:38.281 --> 45:40.515
On 3. 2, 3.

45:40.550 --> 45:43.152
Careful.
Be careful!

45:43.386 --> 45:47.890
All right, I'm gonna need my monitors.
Get me a BP and a pulse up immediately.

45:48.024 --> 45:51.026
Call surgical. Tell them I'm
going to need a central line.

45:51.261 --> 45:52.227
Try the door.

45:52.962 --> 45:55.464
Go. Come here.
Get in there. Get in.

45:56.432 --> 45:58.401
Stay there.
Stay there!
