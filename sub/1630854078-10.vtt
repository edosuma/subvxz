00:01.349 --> 00:03.742
[June] Previously
onThe Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.786 --> 00:05.092
You're coming home.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.442
-[man] Signal's lost.
-[Mark] Get them out.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.793
Gilead took all three planes
down. There are no survivors.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.142
You need security.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.405
I need to represent
traditional Gilead values.

00:14.449 --> 00:17.713
So, you can move in here
with the kid, if you want.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.541
As his new Wife and child.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.804
He had Warren killed
in front of me.

00:21.847 --> 00:25.460
Which he's willing to overlook.
So should you.

00:25.503 --> 00:28.767
-I want my baby here.
-It's never gonna happen.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.900
[grunting]

00:30.943 --> 00:32.597
You know
how we honor those soldiers?

00:32.641 --> 00:33.642
We do not stop fighting.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.947
You're done with Lawrence.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.385
What about Nick Blaine?
I offered to help him.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.301
If he'd help us,
he can still have that.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.911
[Nick] I'm married now.
I have a Wife.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.304
You can bring Rose with you.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.610
Her father's top Commander.
She's happy there.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.047
Rose is pregnant.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.657
Have to do whatever it takes
to protect my family.

00:48.700 --> 00:49.919
Just like you.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.835
June Osborne
is still stirring up trouble.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.881
It's about time
we fixed that problem.
Don't you agree?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.709
Certainly worth considering.

00:57.753 --> 01:02.018
We remember these patriots.
Their sacrifice for our country.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.803
With liberty
and justice for all--

01:04.847 --> 01:06.849
-[gun firing]
-[all screaming]

01:40.752 --> 01:42.580
[breathing shakily]

02:57.960 --> 02:58.917
Hey.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.793
There's another
memorial service this weekend.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.538
-High Park?
-I'm supposed to do a prayer.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.366
I get it. You gotta be safe.

03:12.409 --> 03:16.500
How does it feel?
Is it comfortable?

03:17.849 --> 03:18.850
It's fine, I guess.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.420
I hate this world.

03:28.599 --> 03:32.255
-I love you, though.
-I love you too.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.693
Commander Lawrence, blessed day.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.435
Blessed and exceptionally
busy, Commander.

04:21.478 --> 04:25.700
-Indeed. I do need a moment.
-[groans] Yeah?

04:28.311 --> 04:29.878
There's been a shooting
in Toronto.

04:29.921 --> 04:33.577
Yeah. I heard there's
a lot of anti-refugee sentiment.

04:33.621 --> 04:34.709
I can understand, though.

04:34.752 --> 04:37.929
The Americans
are particularly grating.

04:40.932 --> 04:41.977
June was at the rally.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.545
Huh.

04:44.588 --> 04:49.332
-The Eyes do see.
-She's not a target, Commander.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.335
Well, she could be.
Given everything she's done.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.294
She convinced
those deluded Americans

04:54.337 --> 04:55.904
to send their soldiers
into our country

04:55.947 --> 04:58.907
-to kidnap our children.
-She's not a target.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.387
The government of Gilead

05:00.430 --> 05:03.477
does not target expatriates
for execution.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.915
That is our current policy,
far as I know.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.569
-[man] Commander Lawrence.
-[Lawrence] Yeah?

05:08.612 --> 05:10.440
[man] Your car's downstairs.
We're running behind schedule.

05:10.484 --> 05:14.488
Thank you.
She had a choice, Commander.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.968
She had 1,000 choices.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.669
She's fighting for her daughter.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.366
Yeah?

05:23.410 --> 05:27.457
This is what happens in a fight.
Everyone gets bloody. Everyone.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.505
That you know
to be true, Commander.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.508
Let's go.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.118

Blessed day, Aunt Lydia.

It's no sin to enjoy one's work.
Joyful labor is God's blessing.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.921
I do believe he would prefer
a more appropriate hymn.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.883

07:44.551 --> 07:47.684
And they labor
with such vigor and spirit.

07:48.903 --> 07:52.646
Janine has been
a most helpful influence.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.517
[Aunt Elizabeth]
She truly has been a blessing.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.694
Lydia...

07:59.391 --> 08:02.090
people have been slow to notice
your charity towards Janine,

08:02.133 --> 08:03.483
but they are noticing.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.268
She needs to find a posting

08:06.311 --> 08:07.922
or they will find
another use for her.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.185
-[bell ringing]
-Mmm-hmm.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.680
That's insane.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.944
[Aunt Lydia chuckles]

08:29.987 --> 08:35.210
I admit it's a bit unorthodox,
but if you'll indulge me--

08:35.253 --> 08:36.124
[Naomi] I will not.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.871
Go on.

08:43.914 --> 08:47.396
You've already allowed her to
spend time with precious Angela.

08:47.439 --> 08:50.138
A short visit is one thing...

08:50.181 --> 08:52.793
but to allow her
to live in a room in our home?

08:54.490 --> 08:55.622
No.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.019
I beg your pardon.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.935
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?
Thank you.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.070
Thank you.

09:12.595 --> 09:16.512
Mrs. Putnam,
I believe Commander Lawrence

09:16.556 --> 09:19.123
is looking
for a different image.

09:19.167 --> 09:23.432
One that would reflect
Gilead's new values.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.000
Having this particular Handmaid

09:26.043 --> 09:30.047
join his new household
would complete that picture.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.528
The Commander's home,
where women know their roles.

09:32.572 --> 09:37.751
And in turn, these women are
treated with respect and grace.

09:39.927 --> 09:43.017
I think that picture
is very important to him.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.977
But this Handmaid...

09:48.979 --> 09:51.982
I'll look like
a fool taking her in.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.159
On the contrary.

09:55.203 --> 09:59.686
You would be the model
of forgiveness and grace.

09:59.729 --> 10:03.080
A new Gilead needs
new women at the helm.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.909
Women who are strong
and faithful.

10:06.910 --> 10:10.044
May I say? Women like you.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.700
Yes.

10:16.659 --> 10:19.357
-I'll consider it.
-[laughs] Wonderful.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.319
Come.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.408
[clears throat]

10:27.714 --> 10:29.716
Oh. [chuckles]

10:29.759 --> 10:33.415

You do make a beautiful bride.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.156
Huh?

10:50.606 --> 10:51.651

10:51.694 --> 10:54.741

-Don't jinx it.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.264

11:00.660 --> 11:02.226
This is nice.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.663

11:03.706 --> 11:04.838

Good morning.
I hate to come by so early.

11:35.782 --> 11:36.870
-It's fine.
-[Nichole crying]

11:36.913 --> 11:39.655

-It's all right.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.613

-Yeah.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.180
Do you want some coffee
or something?

11:43.224 --> 11:46.401
No, thank you. I just came by
to tell you and your family,

11:46.444 --> 11:49.752
the gunman was apprehended
very early this morning.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.972
Who was he?

11:52.015 --> 11:55.715
Lanison, John L.
He's, uh, 56 years old,

11:55.758 --> 11:58.500
he works at a bakery,
he has a fishing license.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.762
He's an angry man with a gun.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.850
There are millions
of them.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.852
-But we have this one.

Baby girl,
can you say hi to Mark?

12:08.640 --> 12:09.641
-They found the gunman.
-Yeah.

12:09.685 --> 12:10.991
If he has ties to Gilead

12:11.034 --> 12:12.993
-we will find them.
-Yeah. Okay.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.655

Ms. Osborne.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.526

But...

12:39.410 --> 12:40.498
Thank you for asking.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.502
I know what it's like,

12:46.069 --> 12:48.768
to be responsible for people
and then lose them.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.250

And you too.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.146
Blessed be the fruit,
Aunt Lydia.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.891
The Lord has truly kept
His hand upon you.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.506
How would you like to see
your sweet Angela again?

18:38.073 --> 18:41.337
I would love that. Obviously.

18:41.381 --> 18:46.734
Well, you can. If all
goes well with Mrs. Putnam.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.606
The future Mrs. Lawrence,
I should say.

18:49.650 --> 18:53.915
-Mrs. Lawrence?
-She is to marry the Commander.

18:53.958 --> 18:58.920
Show her the proper respect,
and she said she would consider,

18:58.963 --> 19:04.360
consider, mind you, to allow
you to be posted in her house.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.582
I don't want to be posted.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.501
You said I wouldn't
have to do that again.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.416
You know I never
said such a thing.

19:17.591 --> 19:18.592
[gasping]

19:20.420 --> 19:26.208
My dear... you cannot
stay here indefinitely.

19:28.471 --> 19:32.258
A chance to see
your precious Angela again.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.260
[sobbing softly]

19:35.174 --> 19:36.697
You have come so far.

19:43.791 --> 19:44.879
Yes, Aunt Lydia.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.187
I'm very grateful.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.146
[chuckles]

19:51.190 --> 19:52.495
Praise be.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.193
[chuckles]

20:06.553 --> 20:08.207
[indistinct chatter over PA]

20:10.731 --> 20:12.863
They're taking her
to her room after this.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.346
And Luke?

20:17.390 --> 20:19.522
[Mark] He's giving
a statement to the police.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.351
The driver's in the ICU.

20:24.832 --> 20:29.576
But the police will bring
Luke to her room

20:29.619 --> 20:31.621
as soon as they're
finished questioning him.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.366
It's probably better if...

20:39.890 --> 20:41.283
she doesn't know I was here.

20:44.547 --> 20:45.853
We'll give you some privacy.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.829
[machines beeping steadily]

22:38.487 --> 22:39.793
[sighs softly]

22:49.542 --> 22:52.501
Now that we've fulfilled
our end of the bargain,

22:52.545 --> 22:55.112
I have some papers
for you to sign.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.679
They outline our agreement.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.465
Contract?

22:59.508 --> 23:02.816
If it was up to me,
I'd take you at your word.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.471
Not sure how much
my word is worth right now.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.564
I'd call you an honorable man.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.705
I look forward
to working together.

23:22.749 --> 23:25.142
You have the gratitude
of the United States government.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.799
I'll keep my end of the deal.
You just keep her safe.

23:29.843 --> 23:33.107
-I will do everything I can.
-That's not good enough.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.413
Gilead wants her to suffer.

23:36.023 --> 23:39.896
They'll keep coming for her,
then her family...

23:39.940 --> 23:43.596
and they won't stop.
So I need to know
that you'll protect her.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.642
I need to know
you'll keep her safe.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.863
I will do everything I can.

23:51.038 --> 23:51.952
[chuckles softly]

23:53.780 --> 23:54.868
Okay.

23:57.044 --> 24:02.049
[Mark] When you met June,
when you were
at the Waterfords',

24:02.092 --> 24:04.704
you still held
rank in Eyes,
didn't you?

24:04.747 --> 24:07.620
Yeah, most of the drivers
work for the Eyes.

24:09.056 --> 24:12.102
[Mark] That would have
given you the chance to run.

24:12.146 --> 24:16.063
Maybe not Canada,
but there are places
you could have gone.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.892
You could have
run away with her.

24:25.115 --> 24:29.206
She has people who care for her.
She doesn't need me.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.645
I'm nothing.

24:36.605 --> 24:37.998
No, you're not, Commander.

24:40.870 --> 24:41.741
Not to her.

24:47.094 --> 24:47.921
Go with grace.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.878
Hey, everything's gonna
be all right.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.012
Are you comfortable
having a gun around Nichole?

25:36.056 --> 25:37.753
Yeah.

25:37.797 --> 25:40.974
Yeah, I am. That's how
we're gonna stay safe.

25:41.017 --> 25:44.499
We could ask the police
to guard the house or something.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.632
I don't trust the police.
They don't want us here either.

25:46.675 --> 25:47.937
They fucking hate refugees.

25:49.504 --> 25:51.027
We got to protect ourselves.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.640
Right?

25:57.860 --> 25:58.818
Okay.

26:05.128 --> 26:07.000
This is not gonna
be like Boston.

26:10.612 --> 26:14.964
Boston wasn't your fault.
You know that, right?

26:17.532 --> 26:21.275
I'm not gonna let anyone
hurt you. Promise.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.325
Try and get some rest.

26:34.723 --> 26:35.724
[door shuts]

26:40.120 --> 26:41.034
[grunts]

27:33.390 --> 27:34.783
[Naomi] I have prayed on this

27:34.827 --> 27:36.611
and asked God to guide me,

27:36.655 --> 27:38.918
to allow me to do
what is best for Angela.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.183
Same, ma'am.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.619
I...

27:44.663 --> 27:45.925
I pray for the same thing.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.970
To do what is best
for your daughter.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.277
[Naomi] Yes.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.671
As it turns out,

27:52.714 --> 27:55.935
Angela is with her grandparents
for the entire summer,

27:55.978 --> 27:58.285
which will give you a chance
to prove yourself.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.595
Yes, Mrs. Putnam.

28:04.639 --> 28:08.121
If that is successful,
I will consider
letting you stay.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.123
When Angela returns,
I will oversee

28:10.166 --> 28:12.516
all interactions with her,
now or in the future.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.562
That is inviolate.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.478
-I understand.
-And remember.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.265
She's my daughter.

28:22.309 --> 28:26.487
To say anything else,
to suggest, is heresy.

28:26.530 --> 28:27.706
You could lose your tongue.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.362
I only wish to serve,
Mrs. Putnam.

28:34.016 --> 28:37.411
[Naomi] And remember,
this is a trial period.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.847
Yes, I understand.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.808
Okay. I have to get dressed.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.461
Um...

28:44.505 --> 28:47.247
Aunt Lydia.
We're taking some portraits.

28:47.290 --> 28:50.467
It might be nice to have
the whole household together.

28:51.468 --> 28:54.210
[laughs]

28:54.254 --> 28:58.084
Well, that's very nice.
That's very nice.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.870
What do you say, dear?

29:01.914 --> 29:04.525
-Thank you, Mrs. Putnam.
-You're welcome.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.140
Oh...

29:12.707 --> 29:14.535
I'm so proud of you. [laughs]

29:18.452 --> 29:19.801
You're gonna be a good girl.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.284
-Aren't you?
-Yeah.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.241
-Okay.
-Mmm.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.164
[sighs]

29:41.910 --> 29:43.259
Blessed be the fruit.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.523
May the Lord open.

29:47.742 --> 29:50.745
-June's hurt.
-My June?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.921
A truck hit her on purpose.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.575
They want to kill her
in Toronto.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.232
Who does? How do you know that?

29:59.275 --> 30:01.321
-Is she okay?
-She's alive.

30:03.062 --> 30:06.848
They never let anyone
get away. Fuckers.

30:22.516 --> 30:23.430
[camera shutter clicks]

30:27.042 --> 30:28.087
[camera shutter clicks]

30:30.829 --> 30:32.091
[camera shutter clicks]

30:38.619 --> 30:39.620
[clears throat]

30:47.323 --> 30:50.065
Enough. Enough.
You all have work to do.

30:50.109 --> 30:55.636
Surely you have some function
to perform in my home.

31:04.775 --> 31:09.041
Janine. Have you seen your room?

31:10.781 --> 31:12.305
No, ma'am.

31:12.348 --> 31:15.264
Well, I can have
a Martha show you.

31:15.308 --> 31:18.572
-Okay.
-Or I can show you.

31:22.576 --> 31:24.186
I feel so hopeful. Don't you?

31:26.014 --> 31:27.450
And honestly,
it'll just be nice to have

31:27.494 --> 31:30.584
a friendly face in the house,
Ofjoseph.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.376
That's not my name.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.075
Pardon?

31:44.859 --> 31:46.382
And we're not friends.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.474
Do you really think
that we're friends?

31:53.737 --> 31:55.522
I think

31:55.565 --> 31:59.526
that you are one of the worst
people I have ever known.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.314
I am not your friend.

32:07.316 --> 32:11.146
I hate you, Naomi.
How can you not know that?

32:15.759 --> 32:18.240
[Lawrence]
Excuse me, Mrs.-- Naomi.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.331
Darling, may I have a moment?

32:22.375 --> 32:23.637
[sniffles]

32:23.680 --> 32:25.073
Of course, Commander.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.644
[breathing deeply]

32:53.493 --> 32:55.060
[thunder rumbling]

33:07.333 --> 33:08.377
[gasps]

33:13.382 --> 33:14.993
[people chattering indistinctly]

33:16.995 --> 33:18.605
[Moira] Luke, that guy
was Canadian. Okay?

33:18.648 --> 33:19.954
We're talking about Canada.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.608
[Luke] I did Canada
a fucking favor, all right?

33:21.651 --> 33:23.436
[Rita] I'm afraid they
won't see it that way, Luke.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.133
[Luke] Okay, I do understand
there's a problem.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.221
-[Moira] Do you?
-All right? I ...

33:26.265 --> 33:27.483
I ... understand that.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.050
[Moira] Luke,
what are you talking about?

33:29.094 --> 33:30.225
-[door creaking]
-[Luke] No!

33:30.269 --> 33:31.574
No, she was lying
on the ground. All right?

33:31.618 --> 33:33.011
If you remember?

33:33.054 --> 33:34.664
[Rita] Listen to me,
that's not what they will see.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.405
The people here are different.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.277
[conversation
continues indistinctly]

33:46.285 --> 33:47.503
[Moira] The Canadians

33:47.547 --> 33:48.678
who've been yellin' at us
to get out of here!

33:48.722 --> 33:49.636
[Rita] Come on, listen.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.159
From their perspective,

33:51.203 --> 33:54.467
I think you may be underreacting
to the situation.

33:54.510 --> 33:55.859
[Luke] No,
I'm not underreacting...

33:55.903 --> 33:57.513
-[Rita] How serious is this?
-...you're overreacting.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.646
And you know what would help me?
If you just, like, chilled out.

33:59.689 --> 34:00.864
[Rita] I feel like I have

34:00.908 --> 34:02.127
by giving you
the information that I did.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.303
I don't-- June,
would you go back upstairs?

34:04.346 --> 34:05.913
There's nothing
to worry about down here.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.045
What happened?

34:07.088 --> 34:08.698
My friend
is a Toronto police officer

34:08.742 --> 34:10.439
and she heard an alert.

34:10.483 --> 34:13.790
Mr. Thorpe, the man
from the truck, died.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.053
[June] What?

34:15.096 --> 34:17.490
We talked to Luke's lawyer.
He confirmed it.

34:17.533 --> 34:20.014
-What does it mean?
-It means I killed him.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.537
-But--
-[Moira] No but.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.409
You killed a Canadian
on Canadian soil.

34:23.452 --> 34:24.671
There's a whole bunch of people

34:24.714 --> 34:25.846
who are not gonna wait
for an investigation.

34:25.889 --> 34:26.977
They're just gonna
want you dead.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.023
-Then fuck them.
-[Moira] Both of you.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.329
[Rita] My friend said
that they could get

34:30.372 --> 34:32.287
a signed warrant
for Luke at any minute.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.506
They might even
have one already.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.160
And they will arrest you then.

34:36.596 --> 34:37.814
[Nichole crying]

34:38.728 --> 34:40.774
[Moira] I'll-- I'll get her.

34:40.817 --> 34:43.168
-[breathing shakily]
-[Rita] I'm sorry, Luke.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.698
[Luke] You know what?
I hope they do arrest me.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.221
You know, put me on trial.

34:53.265 --> 34:57.007
I'll tell them-- I'm glad
I-- I protected my wife.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.313
-Okay?
-[June] Luke...

34:58.357 --> 34:59.923
[Luke] I-- What, what?
No, June, listen.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.534
I-I did what I was
supposed to do.

35:01.577 --> 35:02.709
-What am I gonna do?
-Luke.

35:02.752 --> 35:03.840
Let him run over you?

35:03.884 --> 35:05.146
Like, let you die...
Die in the street?

35:05.190 --> 35:06.582
-Luke.
-What?

35:11.718 --> 35:12.719
We have to run.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.636
What?

35:16.679 --> 35:21.206
We waited last time,
and we waited too long.

35:21.249 --> 35:24.426
And we didn't see
how much they hated us.

35:26.167 --> 35:29.562
I lost you.
And then we lost Hannah.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.738
What, you're just gonna
forget about her now?

35:31.781 --> 35:35.350
We will never,
ever forget about her.

35:35.394 --> 35:38.310
But we cannot help her
if we are dead.

35:39.093 --> 35:40.573
It's changing.

35:40.616 --> 35:45.230
Luke... this country
is changing.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.928
No. Canada's not Gilead.

35:50.539 --> 35:55.022
America wasn't Gilead,
until it was

35:55.065 --> 35:57.764
and then,
it was too fucking late.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.375
Luke, we have to go.

36:01.289 --> 36:04.510
We have to run. Now.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.776
It's all right. It's all right.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.693
I put some extra clothes
in the bag for you.

36:13.736 --> 36:14.868
Thank you.

36:14.911 --> 36:17.044
Hey, I made you
a backup res on Delta.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.480
They got a midnight flight.

36:18.524 --> 36:22.136
Anchorage, then Honolulu,
in case you miss the 9:35.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.529
-All right, great.
-Let's not miss it.

36:35.497 --> 36:36.629
Good evening, Ms. Osborne,

36:36.672 --> 36:37.978
-Mr. Bankole.
-What do you want?

36:39.284 --> 36:40.807
You can't go to the airport.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.330
The police have flagged
your reservation.

36:42.374 --> 36:45.115
They'll be waiting
for Mr. Bankole to arrest him.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.639
Ms. Osborne,
you'll be charged as well,

36:46.682 --> 36:48.293
for aiding
a flight from justice.

36:48.336 --> 36:51.818
-What justice?
-What about Nichole?

36:51.861 --> 36:54.560
-You'll lose her.
-What are they supposed to do?

36:54.603 --> 36:55.865
[Mark] Our options are limited.

36:55.909 --> 36:58.694
They ran over me
in my front fucking yard, Mark.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.088
If Luke is convicted
of killing a Canadian,

37:01.131 --> 37:02.481
it's gonna get
a lot worse for us here.

37:02.524 --> 37:03.656
What are they gonna do next?

37:03.699 --> 37:05.658
Drive over my daughter
just to get to me?

37:08.008 --> 37:11.272
-We're not safe here anymore.
-No, you're not.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.100
We'll take our chances
at the airport.

37:13.143 --> 37:14.232
Yeah.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.668
[Mark] There might be
another way out.

37:15.711 --> 37:19.672
American refugees are on
their way here from all over.

37:19.715 --> 37:22.675
Canada doesn't want them
anymore. No one does.

37:23.371 --> 37:24.503
They're all coming here.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.896
We're putting them
on trains to go west.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.856
I can get you on one.

37:41.868 --> 37:42.782
[Rose] Sweetheart...

37:51.051 --> 37:52.357
Hey.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.793
-[groans]
-Blaine.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.404
You could've killed her.
You could've fuckin' killed her!

37:56.448 --> 38:00.539
Commander, it wasn't me.
It wasn't my decision.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.332
Cake? Gentlemen.

38:19.732 --> 38:20.733
[sniffles]

38:28.480 --> 38:30.569
You had
the most wonderful opportunity.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.574
And you threw it away.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.579
What do you want me
to say, Aunt Lydia?

38:40.622 --> 38:41.841
[Aunt Lydia] Janine...

38:45.540 --> 38:48.630
you must fix this.
You can fix this.

38:50.676 --> 38:56.725
You must beg... the Commander
and Mrs. Lawrence for mercy...

38:58.466 --> 38:59.728
and forgiveness.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.566
No. Aunt Lydia, I won't.
I won't do it.

39:17.485 --> 39:18.747
You've lost all sense.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.229
[chokes]

39:22.272 --> 39:26.755
All of the good that you have
managed to bring into your life.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.278
[door opens]

39:28.322 --> 39:30.933
-The Eyes are here.
-What?

39:30.977 --> 39:31.934
For Janine.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.025
-What's going on here?
-[Eye] This is the one.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.418
What are you doing?

39:37.462 --> 39:40.595
You take your hands
off her this minute.

39:40.639 --> 39:43.337
I will call Commander Lawrence.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.860
Commander Lawrence
gave the order.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.080
That is not possible.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.560
Aunt Lydia,
don't worry about me.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.953
I'll be fine. Don't worry
about me. I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:50.997 --> 39:55.044
What are you putting on her?
Don't you dare put that on her.

39:55.088 --> 40:00.746
Where are you taking her?
Janine? This is outrageous.

40:00.789 --> 40:03.139
I'm calling the Commander
this minute.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.838
You will pay for this. Stop!

40:05.881 --> 40:08.841
I said take your hands off her.

40:08.884 --> 40:12.497
I am calling
the Commander right now.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.761
You answer me!
Where are you taking her?

40:16.718 --> 40:17.719
Janine!

40:18.285 --> 40:20.374
[dogs barking]

40:20.418 --> 40:21.723
Janine.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.986
She is my girl and my concern,

40:24.030 --> 40:26.162
and I insist
that you release her.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.163
[Eye] Stop.

40:32.473 --> 40:33.605

[siren chirping]

41:46.286 --> 41:47.243
Holy shit.

41:54.642 --> 41:55.904
[Mark] From Vancouver,

41:55.948 --> 41:57.776
you should be able
to get a boat to the States

41:57.819 --> 41:59.778
but if Canada Rail has his name,

41:59.821 --> 42:01.257
your refugee cards'll
be flagged.

42:01.301 --> 42:06.959
-Throw them away. Take these.
-Hey, Tuello. Thanks.

42:11.354 --> 42:13.922
Can you get a message to Nick?

42:13.966 --> 42:16.011
Just tell him that I'm safe.

42:16.055 --> 42:18.623
Tell him
that Nichole is safe, okay?

42:19.667 --> 42:21.843
Just tell him that we're okay.

42:21.887 --> 42:25.630
-Will you do that for me?
-Yes, I will.

42:25.673 --> 42:28.894
-Thanks.
-Godspeed, Ms. Osborne.

50:03.391 --> 50:08.527
-I do love you.
-You're a liar.

50:08.570 --> 50:12.270
You say that because you want
to feel like you're a good man.

50:12.313 --> 50:14.707
But a good man
wouldn't leave his pregnant wife

We're going
to a beautiful island

and the water is clear.

52:54.301 --> 52:55.781
