00:00.995 --> 00:02.364
- Father?
- Daughter?

00:02.746 --> 00:04.870
Why is there a naked lady
in your bedroom?

00:05.025 --> 00:06.822
What are you
talking about, revenge?

00:06.962 --> 00:09.525
Don't make it like it wasn't
the least bit satisfying

00:09.705 --> 00:11.614
to fuck the wife of the man
who turned your

00:11.820 --> 00:13.497
"precious little book"
into a big, shitty movie.

00:14.184 --> 00:16.433
Sick of you talking shit
about me in the press.

00:16.620 --> 00:20.463
I thought you came because
you found out I fucked your wife.

00:20.764 --> 00:21.764
Asshole.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.730
Charlie Runkel's office.

00:25.019 --> 00:28.130
Your assistant makes me want to
touch myself in a bad place.

00:28.566 --> 00:31.830
But from now on, if I make a mistake
or I screw something up,

00:32.427 --> 00:35.559
you should feel free to discipline me
in whatever way you see fit.

00:38.229 --> 00:40.630
- Hi. Remember me?
- How could I forget?

00:40.770 --> 00:43.830
- Best blind date of my life, asshole.
- Let me make it up to you.

00:43.970 --> 00:46.199
Can I take you out sometime?

00:48.179 --> 00:50.530
The guy you saw me with
last night is married.

00:50.912 --> 00:52.745
Fucking a married a guy for 5 years?

00:53.005 --> 00:55.697
Call him whatever you want.
He can stay with me.

00:55.837 --> 00:58.596
Once upon a time, I used to love you.

00:58.886 --> 01:01.990
And no matter what, you will
always be a part of my life.

01:02.347 --> 01:04.449
But I'm not in love with you anymore.

01:05.489 --> 01:09.645

01:11.437 --> 01:14.264
Yusef, what's a five-letter word
for "excitable boy"?

01:14.404 --> 01:15.404
Zevon.

01:15.702 --> 01:17.007
Booyah.

01:17.817 --> 01:19.226
That's a smart dog.

01:25.703 --> 01:26.703
So...

01:26.903 --> 01:29.264
- last night.
- What about it?

01:29.404 --> 01:31.697
I don't want to be hyperbolic
or anything,

01:31.837 --> 01:34.697
but I think we took things
to a whole other level.

01:35.047 --> 01:37.830
And why do you feel the need
to relive it the next morning?

01:38.281 --> 01:40.663
That's half the fun.
You know, it's like...

01:41.351 --> 01:43.064
getting to do it all over again.

01:43.624 --> 01:46.920
Except without the after-sex sadness

01:48.077 --> 01:50.528
that comes down upon one.

01:55.937 --> 01:57.630
Hank, I think we need to talk.

01:58.274 --> 01:59.668
Talk, really?

01:59.879 --> 02:03.457
Has anything good ever come
of such a thing ever?

02:04.800 --> 02:07.193
We've been spending
a lot of time in the bedroom,

02:07.333 --> 02:09.126
which is nice, very nice.

02:10.424 --> 02:13.515
But I'm also just coming out of this
horribly dysfunctional relationship

02:13.655 --> 02:15.580
that only existed in the bedroom...

02:15.808 --> 02:17.784
You want me to do you in the shower.

02:18.757 --> 02:19.757
I get it.

02:19.898 --> 02:22.630
You want to go out on the town
with some Hank on your arm.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.475
You want to stroll around
with some of this.

02:26.470 --> 02:29.794
That's totally understandable.
We can do it. We can go out. Anything.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.297
Anything you want to do.
We'll do it. Just name it.

02:32.437 --> 02:33.830
Let's go. Right now.

02:34.148 --> 02:37.104
- Okay, there's this fund-raiser.
- No, can't do that.

02:37.337 --> 02:40.408
That sounds excruciating.
I won't do that.

02:40.581 --> 02:42.386
It's your agency. You must be invited.

02:42.558 --> 02:44.732
And I'm sure it went
right in the circular file.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.763
Come on, it'll be fun.

02:47.059 --> 02:48.530
It's for a good cause.

02:48.801 --> 02:52.763
Well, I'm not much one for causes,
good or otherwise.

02:52.903 --> 02:54.365
I'm not a joiner.

02:54.505 --> 02:57.237
- Apathy kills, Hank.
- I don't care.

03:05.095 --> 03:06.796
Does that feel like apathy to you?

04:12.738 --> 04:14.390
You look...

04:15.027 --> 04:17.363
half, you know, halfway decent.

04:17.668 --> 04:18.916
Thanks.

04:20.742 --> 04:21.836
How's Becca?

04:23.518 --> 04:26.613
- Well, she's a little bummed.
- Well, that's understandable,

04:26.791 --> 04:29.383
- but this thing came up.
- I know, but she's just...

04:31.428 --> 04:33.586
- Dad.
- Beautiful daughter.

04:37.144 --> 04:40.797
- Gee, I don't know where that...
- A bribe?

04:41.278 --> 04:45.064
No, I like to think of it more as
a token of my paternal affection.

04:48.050 --> 04:49.679
Are you serious?

04:50.409 --> 04:51.808
This is awesome!

04:52.250 --> 04:55.964
Just when I thought we'd agreed
not to get her a cell phone.

04:56.106 --> 04:59.227
I thought we decided that, too,
but then I realized she can call me

04:59.414 --> 05:01.598
whenever she's pissed
at you and lurch, so...

05:02.851 --> 05:04.325
... changed my mind.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.486
Do you have a date?

05:08.164 --> 05:10.288
- I do.
- Do you like her?

05:10.937 --> 05:13.763
- She is pretty cool.
- As cool as mom?

05:14.396 --> 05:17.301
Sadly, I have come to find
that that is not possible.

05:17.545 --> 05:20.830
Well, if it's a date
and not just a random hookup,

05:21.594 --> 05:23.705
- I guess I approve.
- Yes!

05:24.247 --> 05:26.069
But I wanna hear
all about her tomorrow.

05:26.229 --> 05:27.634
Absolutely.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.289
Call me.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.178
I can't believe you.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.403
So...

05:37.070 --> 05:38.967
Stop it. The date.

05:39.621 --> 05:41.223
- Are you in love?
- Shut up.

05:41.464 --> 05:43.995
Where are you taking her?
Red Lobster? Denny's?

05:44.327 --> 05:47.030
I wish. I got this fucking fund-raiser
at the agency

05:47.170 --> 05:49.031
I got roped into going to.

05:57.177 --> 05:59.730
Fascist architecture.
Can I ask you a question?

05:59.870 --> 06:02.697
- Go for it.
- What are we doing here?

06:02.837 --> 06:06.056
- Mixing and mingling.
- That's what I thought.

06:06.216 --> 06:09.853
That explains why my sphincter
tightened up a couple notches.

06:10.113 --> 06:11.364
Relax.

06:13.087 --> 06:14.270
There's your agent.

06:25.537 --> 06:27.596
- What the fuck?
- What's the problem?

06:27.736 --> 06:29.707
You know how much I hate
that motherfucker.

06:29.967 --> 06:33.697
Yes, I know how much you hate
that A-list, in-demand motherfucker.

06:34.199 --> 06:36.364
But I've been trying
to sign him for years.

06:36.723 --> 06:38.663
Don't make me
fire your ass all over again.

06:39.131 --> 06:42.200
Hank, if I depended on you and
you alone for my commissions,

06:42.350 --> 06:45.749
Marcy and I would be sharing a TV dinner
under a bare light bulb right now.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.496
OK but don't do it in front of me.

06:47.636 --> 06:50.105
It's like watching you
cheat on me with another man.

06:50.929 --> 06:53.930
You give much better head.
Always have, always will.

06:54.070 --> 06:55.419
I am impressed.

06:55.584 --> 06:58.167
I can't believe you managed
to drag this nonpartisan asshole

06:58.308 --> 07:01.674
- out of the house for this shindig.
- I had to use all of my feminine wiles.

07:01.832 --> 07:02.943
And a butt plug.

07:03.783 --> 07:06.519
Speaking of which... where's Marcy?

07:06.903 --> 07:08.941
Emergency waxing session.

07:09.180 --> 07:13.030
As we speak, she's likely staring into
the business end of Angelina’s vagina.

07:14.203 --> 07:17.697
Let's take a time-out while I meditate
on that for a few moments.

07:18.218 --> 07:21.304
You do that.
I see a friend. You come find me.

07:22.603 --> 07:25.037
I'm sorry. did you say something?

07:27.603 --> 07:30.563
I told you, man. You just needed
to meet a nice girl.

07:30.703 --> 07:32.930
- She's not so nice.
- Naughty?

07:33.596 --> 07:35.100
Do I ask you about Marcy's

07:35.301 --> 07:38.997
- sexual proclivities?
- Yes, all the time. It's odd, actually.

07:39.289 --> 07:43.075
So, what are we talking about here?
A little "S&M"? A little light "B&D"?

07:43.765 --> 07:45.193
Slow down, tiger.

07:46.927 --> 07:49.504
Morticia. Call me Hank, please.

07:52.241 --> 07:55.424
- So, do you still need me?
- Did you finish reading the manuscript?

07:56.248 --> 07:58.830
- Did you write your coverage on it yet?
- No, not yet.

07:58.970 --> 08:01.596
Then, I think you just answered
your own question.

08:01.892 --> 08:03.819
- Back to work.
- Yes, sir.

08:08.770 --> 08:11.684
Anything you want to tell me
about there, captain?

08:12.373 --> 08:14.495
Please. I'm a married man.

08:17.170 --> 08:20.104
Anything you want to tell me
about there, captain?

08:27.513 --> 08:30.431
Can we agree not to throw down
while we have our cocks out?

08:30.947 --> 08:32.804
Really? Yours is out?

08:35.624 --> 08:37.493
- Fag.
- I'm done fighting you, Moody.

08:37.794 --> 08:41.462
This from a man who had a six-pack of
whoop-ass opened up on him last week.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.513
I couldn't hurt you if I wanted to.
You're your own worst enemy.

08:45.771 --> 08:49.278
That is a very astute observation
coming from a dumb guy.

08:49.899 --> 08:51.463
Did me a big favor, actually.

08:51.726 --> 08:54.503
Got me out of a horrible
fucking marriage.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.455
You and Sandy splitting the sheets?
Do tell.

08:57.749 --> 09:00.775
That bitch is crazy. Last time I ever
marry a fucking white woman.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.203
I'm with you there.

09:02.363 --> 09:04.644
- Well, how'd she take it?
- Haven't told her.

09:05.034 --> 09:07.624
- Thinking about doing it tonight.
- Here? she's here?

09:07.764 --> 09:08.847
That's right.

09:25.383 --> 09:28.416
There she is.
The former Mrs. Moody.

09:28.727 --> 09:30.426
I was never officially a Moody.

09:30.897 --> 09:32.913
You were moody.
You just weren't a Moody.

09:33.089 --> 09:36.001
You could've made me less moody
if you'd made me into a Moody.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.588
- I'll make you a Moody right now.
- It's too late.

09:38.748 --> 09:41.101
- It's 4 hours to Vegas.
- No, it's too late.

09:41.636 --> 09:45.384
We'll stop in Barstow, in-n-out burgers,
shakes, fries, celebratory coupling,

09:45.679 --> 09:48.373
which I believe is part
of our sordid sexual history.

09:48.513 --> 09:51.445
You know, it's very tempting,
but I'm gonna have to say no.

09:51.710 --> 09:53.365
But thank you. Over.

09:53.974 --> 09:56.726
Could you be
on your best behavior tonight?

09:57.007 --> 09:58.082
Please, please.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.664
Like a child you talk to me.
What do you think I'll do?

10:00.804 --> 10:03.291
- You are a child.
- Stir the punch with my dong?

10:03.447 --> 10:04.757
Quite possibly, yes.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.456
And that's the thing with you, Hank.

10:07.596 --> 10:11.892
One never knows what to expect
from you or your dong.

10:12.183 --> 10:13.864
And how is this not a virtue?

10:17.296 --> 10:19.970
You know, honey,
you do look beautiful tonight.

10:20.552 --> 10:22.712
Well, that's... Thank you.
Thank you.

10:26.865 --> 10:29.848
Stop it! No. You just said
you would behave.

10:29.988 --> 10:31.691
Bill is around the corner.

10:31.959 --> 10:35.020
- Okay, come on. We can be adults.
- It just gets so lonely sometimes.

10:35.277 --> 10:38.770
I need a hug in a moment, the moment
passes, and I'm good. Smell you later.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.652
- You finished yet?
- Putting it together right now.

10:45.830 --> 10:47.380
Bring it to me in my office.

10:49.268 --> 10:51.268
U.T.K. Charlie Runkel's office.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.178
It's your wife.

10:57.118 --> 10:58.292
Hey, baby.

10:59.569 --> 11:00.890
Yeah, it's going well.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.260
How about you?
How is Angelina's cookie?

11:09.427 --> 11:10.620
Really?

11:11.474 --> 11:13.824
Well, that's one of the benefits
of adoption.

11:19.196 --> 11:21.928
You know what?
You're... you're breaking up.

11:24.697 --> 11:27.514
Yeah, you're... You're...
I'm losing you, babe.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.321
Okay, got to go.

11:38.142 --> 11:39.551
Tell me what to do.

11:42.449 --> 11:44.833
What if you don't wanna do
what I tell you to do?

11:46.355 --> 11:47.979
I think you're missing the point.

11:57.241 --> 11:58.330
Thank you.

12:00.895 --> 12:02.341
There you are.

12:03.881 --> 12:05.120
Hank Moody,

12:05.477 --> 12:08.702
please say hello to my colleague
Jonathan Mandel

12:08.842 --> 12:11.153
and his lovely wife, Nikki.

12:11.808 --> 12:13.872
- Hank Moody? The writer?
- I used to be.

12:14.092 --> 12:17.262
Now I'm Hank Moody the blogger,
soon to be Hank Moody the bartender.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.108
Meredith turned me on to your blog.

12:21.419 --> 12:24.667
- Highly entertaining, Hank.
- Well, that's what I do. I entertain.

12:24.949 --> 12:28.240
I'd be interested to see what you write
about this little shindig.

12:28.783 --> 12:31.322
Well, just off the top of my head...

12:33.126 --> 12:36.311
I find interesting to hear these people
ranting and raving about saving

12:36.492 --> 12:39.546
the environment when they'll probably
blow like 10 000 pounds of fuel

12:39.727 --> 12:42.722
on their private jet planes
getting down to Cabo this weekend.

12:42.910 --> 12:44.685
That's right, babs. You heard me.

12:45.013 --> 12:46.468
Tell Oprah I said so.

12:46.745 --> 12:48.942
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it, ladies.

12:50.568 --> 12:53.701
- Meredith, can I get you another drink?
- Will you excuse us?

12:57.334 --> 13:00.198
- Your writing is so good.
- Well, Thank you.

13:00.482 --> 13:03.338
I'm a bit of a scribbler myself,
you know?

13:04.792 --> 13:06.395
Nikki Man... That Nikki Mandel.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.563
You write all that Hollywood, trophy,

13:08.829 --> 13:11.300
- clit-lit stank, don't you?
- That's me.

13:11.720 --> 13:15.362
Masturbation material for the North
of Montana <i>hausfrau</i>.

13:15.622 --> 13:17.389
You had me at masturbation.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.741
- I was hoping so.
- You got me all wet.

13:20.001 --> 13:22.396
The trick is coming up
with good story ideas.

13:22.556 --> 13:23.672
I would imagine.

13:23.814 --> 13:26.061
I'm always on the lookout
for new material...

13:26.845 --> 13:30.311
- if you know what I mean.
- It's hard not to know what you mean,

13:30.607 --> 13:32.721
especially when you're being
so subtle about it.

13:32.882 --> 13:34.545
Doesn't pay to be a wallflower.

13:34.705 --> 13:36.370
You and your husband seem fine.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.989
- What's the deal?
- Looks can be deceiving.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.930
Those two have been playing grab-ass
for years now.

13:45.466 --> 13:47.554
"I see," said the blind man.

13:49.554 --> 13:51.015
Excuse me a moment.

13:53.019 --> 13:54.691
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:54.955 --> 13:56.926
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?

13:57.066 --> 13:59.680
No, what are you doing?
That's married guy. Come on.

14:00.325 --> 14:03.410
- I didn't know he was gonna be here.
- Come on.

14:04.620 --> 14:05.794
Okay, I knew.

14:06.384 --> 14:07.372
I'm sorry.

14:07.632 --> 14:09.168
I don't care. It's still a lie.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.626
Look, you want to create
a fuss with me?

14:11.886 --> 14:13.545
That's fine. I'm listening.

14:13.807 --> 14:16.205
I'm kid chaos.
I'll create some chaos for you.

14:16.622 --> 14:17.645
How?

14:18.039 --> 14:19.119
How?

14:31.752 --> 14:33.981
I want to be a 40-year-old virgin.

14:35.395 --> 14:36.428
Why?

14:37.219 --> 14:39.360
Because it seems like,
once you get laid,

14:39.557 --> 14:41.707
your life basically turns to shit.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.795
It's not so bad.

14:46.915 --> 14:48.121
You've had the sex?

14:49.309 --> 14:50.398
Sure.

14:51.804 --> 14:53.053
What's it like?

14:57.497 --> 14:58.673
Good.

15:01.436 --> 15:02.901
Bad.

15:04.332 --> 15:05.347
Weird.

15:06.219 --> 15:07.439
Powerful.

15:08.596 --> 15:12.508
I don't know. Look, don't worry about
this stuff. You got plenty of time.

15:12.777 --> 15:14.825
- Watch the hair.
- Sorry.

15:18.393 --> 15:20.083
You Miss your dad, don't you?

15:25.057 --> 15:26.165
I Miss my mom.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.373
For what it's worth,
I know my mom really likes you.

15:34.442 --> 15:35.644
I like her, too.

15:36.134 --> 15:37.496
It's just...

15:38.397 --> 15:39.665
not the same, you know?

15:44.969 --> 15:46.255
Do you like Bill?

15:47.281 --> 15:48.980
Sure. He's nice.

15:50.839 --> 15:52.269
But he's not like Hank.

15:54.673 --> 15:56.776
Seriously, you're really lucky.

16:09.877 --> 16:10.948
Nice.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.732
- Watch it!
- Well, thank you.

16:17.873 --> 16:18.956
Great!

16:19.341 --> 16:22.789
- You could look where you're going.
- And you could be a bit less of a cunt.

16:23.555 --> 16:26.033
- What did you say?
- What did I say? I cunt hear you.

16:26.822 --> 16:28.388
Back it up, lady!

16:29.697 --> 16:31.108
What the hell happened here?

16:31.259 --> 16:34.156
The guy spills his drink on me,
then he called me a cunt.

16:34.296 --> 16:36.398
I didn't say a word!
I bumped into her. My bad.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.264
- You liar! Yes, you did!
- She just freaked out on me.

16:39.404 --> 16:41.188
You should've come and get me.

16:41.328 --> 16:43.737
- I can take care of myself. Thank you.
- Clearly.

16:43.997 --> 16:47.273
Sweetie, this is hardly the time
or the place for a scene.

16:47.582 --> 16:51.196
Can't we all just get along? I'm not
looking to press charges or anything.

16:52.484 --> 16:54.698
- Get off of me.
- He's trying to be decent.

16:54.844 --> 16:56.369
No. He's trying to be a dick.

16:56.530 --> 16:59.521
You want me to have him thrown out?
Just say the word and I will.

16:59.661 --> 17:01.196
I don't. I just want to go.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.979
Now, look, there's a couple
I want you to meet.

17:07.607 --> 17:09.702
Turns out they bought
that house you re-did.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.363
There we go. Turn.

17:14.871 --> 17:16.233
Come on, lean forward.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.737
Yeah, just like that.

17:18.192 --> 17:19.395
Just like that.

17:19.654 --> 17:21.718
Look at you, you dirty,
little animal.

17:21.894 --> 17:23.215
- Like this?
- Yes.

17:26.925 --> 17:27.915
I missed.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.998
Yes, look at that.

17:31.620 --> 17:34.124
- Holy fucknuts!
- Shit!

17:34.404 --> 17:37.706
- What, don't you fucking knock?
- Don't you lock?

17:40.378 --> 17:43.040
Why don't you go grab him
some water or something?

17:47.471 --> 17:50.056
Take it easy there, Diane Arbus.

17:50.974 --> 17:52.436
Don't have a coronary,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.423
'cause I wouldn't know how
to explain that to your wife.

17:56.987 --> 18:00.733
It's all right. Maybe it's time
to punch out there, Bettie Page.

18:12.504 --> 18:13.504
Here.

18:15.913 --> 18:19.064
First things first... You're not gonna
stroke out on me, are you?

18:20.063 --> 18:22.223
Good. You just relax.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.863
It's all good. It was me.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.206
You're lucky it was
me coming in that door, huh?

18:29.560 --> 18:32.722
Look at me, look at me.
Let me see those eyes.

18:33.103 --> 18:35.289
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

18:36.677 --> 18:38.972
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck were you thinking

18:39.130 --> 18:40.840
fucking around with your secretary?

18:40.980 --> 18:42.983
"How much of a big fat cliché can I be"?

18:43.125 --> 18:44.931
She started it, man.

18:47.245 --> 18:48.339
Come on.

18:49.728 --> 18:50.815
I guess I...

18:51.656 --> 18:54.060
- ... got a little carried away.
- You think?

18:54.401 --> 18:57.781
I don't even know what happened, man.
One minute, I am sailing along,

18:58.020 --> 19:01.530
I'm being the guy who would
never, ever cheat on his wife.

19:02.904 --> 19:06.651
The next second, I'm spanking the bare,
naked ass of a 22-year-old girl.

19:08.364 --> 19:11.569
I'm not gonna be judgmental,
because, a/ Who the fuck am I to talk?

19:11.750 --> 19:14.674
and b/ What you just described
sounds incredibly hot.

19:14.935 --> 19:16.841
But you got to get your shit together.

19:17.729 --> 19:20.097
All right? You owe it to Marcy.

19:20.348 --> 19:22.977
I know.
I'm such a fucking asshole, man.

19:23.374 --> 19:25.804
If anybody deserves
to be disciplined, it's me.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.048
It's not an invitation.

19:32.012 --> 19:34.236
If you're having
problems in the boudoir,

19:34.544 --> 19:36.760
it's worth a conversation
with the old lady.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.197
I'm afraid that ship
sailed some time ago.

19:44.690 --> 19:46.090
I don't know, you know,

19:46.251 --> 19:49.053
Marcy, to me, is nothing
if not a dirty, little girl.

19:50.003 --> 19:52.087
I think, with all due respect,

19:53.170 --> 19:54.849
if you talk to her, I think

19:55.223 --> 19:58.408
she'd be into some seriously
freaky shit.

20:06.527 --> 20:09.335
Big boy. You're not crying, are you?

20:10.576 --> 20:12.550
- A little bit.
Jesus Christ.

20:17.907 --> 20:19.943
- May I have another glass of wine?
- Hey!

20:20.184 --> 20:22.870
Time to hang up
your drinking shoes, lady.

20:25.146 --> 20:26.930
You love me, don't you, Hank?

20:27.172 --> 20:29.364
I've certainly grown very fond of you.

20:29.504 --> 20:31.763
- But I think that's...
- Let me guess.

20:32.446 --> 20:35.733
It's a little early for
this particular discussion.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.677
Something like that, yeah.

20:38.476 --> 20:42.030
We'll probably never make it
to this particular discussion.

20:42.602 --> 20:44.019
Why do you say that?

20:45.193 --> 20:48.951
Well, when you've spent
the last five years loving a man

20:50.393 --> 20:52.777
and wondering why
he doesn't love you back...

20:54.684 --> 20:57.509
...you tend to get
a wee bit cynical about things.

21:01.796 --> 21:03.515
You stay right here...

21:06.010 --> 21:07.766
... and you hydrate.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.328
I'll be right back.

21:25.890 --> 21:26.986
What'd you say?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.351
You need a double dose
of Viagra to get wood

21:29.493 --> 21:31.441
and you wear a fanny pack
on the weekends.

21:33.122 --> 21:36.222
- Think you're pretty clever, don't you?
- You wanna fuck around, fine.

21:36.403 --> 21:38.394
Fuck around all you want,
I'm no judge Judy.

21:38.536 --> 21:40.755
But don't string a woman along
for a major chunk

21:40.897 --> 21:43.043
of her childbearing years.
That's not cool.

21:43.203 --> 21:46.730
- Who are you? Don Quixote?
- No, I'm not even Don fucking Knotts.

21:47.176 --> 21:50.530
- I'm a big fan of the lady in question.
- That's incredibly noble,

21:50.670 --> 21:53.662
considering how the lady
in question talks about you.

21:54.056 --> 21:55.581
I was curious,

21:55.822 --> 21:58.563
because despite what you say,
I do care about her,

21:58.805 --> 22:02.238
So, I asked, "Who is he? Is this
someone I need to worry about?"

22:02.607 --> 22:03.966
You know what she said?

22:04.148 --> 22:07.583
"Him? He's nobody, a loser,

22:08.876 --> 22:12.431
"someone to pass the time with
when I'm not in bed with you."

22:13.777 --> 22:16.903
So, maybe you're the one who
needs to be cut loose, pal.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.494
- You're very lucky, my friend.
- And why is that?

22:22.759 --> 22:25.426
'Cause I promised someone
I'd be on my best behavior.

22:25.694 --> 22:26.984
Fucking fucker!

22:28.674 --> 22:30.823
- My God!
- What are you doing?

22:30.970 --> 22:32.625
I'm glad we came.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.364
That was fun.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.667
You're funny.

22:38.747 --> 22:41.508
There you go. You're good, you're good.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.184
- Proud of me?
- Almost never, but,

22:50.385 --> 22:51.897
yeah, I approve.

22:52.117 --> 22:55.819
No, no.
My behavior... me and my dong.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.428
- Well-behaved.
- Right... good.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.792
- Did nothing.
- Congratulations.

23:01.082 --> 23:03.763
You are proud of me.
Did you have a good night?

23:03.956 --> 23:05.499
Yeah, I did.

23:05.789 --> 23:08.730
For a radical environmentalist
such as yourself,

23:08.870 --> 23:11.897
this whole evening must have
given you a clit-boner.

23:12.114 --> 23:13.706
You're disgusting.

23:14.305 --> 23:15.726
See you next Tuesday!

23:16.859 --> 23:17.891
Fuck you!

23:19.951 --> 23:21.794
What is that? What are you doing?

23:22.003 --> 23:25.023
He's just a classy guy.
He called me a cunt.

23:25.291 --> 23:28.766
- This guy called you a cunt?
- I dealt with it. I dealt with it.

23:28.952 --> 23:30.646
It's okay, I just want to...

23:31.387 --> 23:32.589
Excuse me.

23:37.911 --> 23:39.033
Good night.

23:39.749 --> 23:40.916
Good night.

23:58.215 --> 24:00.155
- Hey.
- Hey, mom.

24:00.495 --> 24:02.946
I'm sorry. Go back to sleep.

24:04.755 --> 24:06.394
- Mom?
- Yeah?

24:07.069 --> 24:08.778
Can I ask you something?

24:08.983 --> 24:10.789
Anything, my love.

24:11.871 --> 24:13.153
Do you love Bill?

24:16.324 --> 24:17.326
Yeah.

24:18.223 --> 24:19.309
Yeah, I do.

24:20.471 --> 24:21.935
Do you love dad?

24:22.104 --> 24:23.218
Yes...

24:24.259 --> 24:26.314
because we have you in common.

24:27.411 --> 24:30.551
I mean... I don't love him

24:30.711 --> 24:33.496
in that butterflies-in-the-tummy
way anymore.

24:33.712 --> 24:34.798
I mean...

24:35.305 --> 24:38.145
not in the way that we love
Johnny Depp, definitely not.

24:39.531 --> 24:40.593
Right.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.701
Is dad a bad person?

24:44.300 --> 24:45.668
No, not at all.

24:46.458 --> 24:47.980
He does have a habit

24:48.121 --> 24:50.463
of getting himself and
everyone else around him

24:50.603 --> 24:52.627
into trouble sometimes, but...

24:58.031 --> 24:59.881
Bill is a good person, sweetie.

25:01.591 --> 25:04.229
You know, he's kind, he's smart,

25:05.469 --> 25:06.831
and he really...

25:07.953 --> 25:09.636
He thinks things through.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.423
I love you.

25:18.331 --> 25:20.279
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:27.431 --> 25:30.897
It's been a long time since someone
held my hair back as I puked.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.652
It's been an honor and a privilege.

25:43.690 --> 25:45.087
Care to join me?

25:45.307 --> 25:48.093
Whew, still kind of barfy.
Get some sleep.

25:51.653 --> 25:52.654
Thank you.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.363
It's what I do.

26:11.133 --> 26:13.830
"B" to the "E" to the "C"
to the "C" to the "A."

26:14.032 --> 26:16.195
<i>- Hi, dad.</i>
- What up, G?

26:16.777 --> 26:19.730
I called because I had
a feeling you couldn't sleep.

26:20.684 --> 26:23.763
Right as usual, my beautiful,
precocious daughter.

26:24.377 --> 26:27.929
Remember what you used to do
for me when I couldn't sleep?

26:28.882 --> 26:30.543
<i>Dose you with opiates?</i>.

26:32.134 --> 26:34.718
<i>You'd look at the ocean
and count the mermaids.</i>

26:35.960 --> 26:37.319
I did do that.

26:38.429 --> 26:40.713
I'm a better father than I thought.

26:42.056 --> 26:44.781
Maybe you should try that,
and it will help.

26:47.101 --> 26:48.103
Yeah.

26:53.207 --> 26:54.208
<i>One...</i>

26:57.468 --> 26:58.470
Two...

26:59.376 --> 27:01.850
Three... no, that's a sea lion.

27:03.903 --> 27:04.903
<i>Four...</i>

27:06.994 --> 27:07.956
Five...

27:08.957 --> 27:11.061
Six... no, that's a bum.

27:13.511 --> 27:14.537
<i>Seven...</i>

27:16.108 --> 27:17.116
Eight...

27:18.072 --> 27:20.896
Nine... no, that's Daryl Hannah.

27:23.682 --> 27:24.694
<i>Ten...</i>

27:28.271 --> 27:29.363
Eleven...
