WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:10.344
Wow. Busy today.
Has Luke been advertising?

00:10.427 --> 00:11.637
He gets good word of mouth.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.805
We have to start spreading
bad word of mouth...

00:13.847 --> 00:15.474
so we can always have a table.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.809
That would be wrong, but sure.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.520
- Vermin?
- Or no potable water.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.647
- Or no potable vermin.
- That'd scare them away.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.565
Or confuse them away.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.611
- Weird seeing him talking like that.
- Like what?

00:27.694 --> 00:28.904
Just all friendly.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.448
He's usually only good for a couple
of gruff monosyllables, then he's off.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.117
He is the master of the monosyllable.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.328
He never flirts with women.
Do you notice that?

00:36.411 --> 00:38.789
- He's flirted with you numerous times.
- Don't start.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.832
Flirt with him now. We need coffee.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.877
Luke, we are just dying
for some refreshments.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.671
Keep your pants on.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.173
He can turn it off and on so fast.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.218
I found a CD
under the front seat of our car.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.594
Did you lose one?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.680
Not that I know of,
but I'm sloppy with them.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.057
- So you didn't hide it?
- Why would I hide a CD?

00:57.140 --> 01:00.227
- Don't know. Bay City Rollers?
- It's not a Bay City Rollers CD.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.021
- How do you know?
- I know what's not hidden under the seat.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.524
Because you know
Barry Manilow is under that seat.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.401
- Where's Barry Manilow?
- Under Mom's seat.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.987
- I confess I was hiding Barry Manilow.
- You confess?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.905
He was very big when I was very small.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.325
It's the live version where he does
a medley of his commercial jingles.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.953
Don't worry.
Everyone's allowed a guilty pleasure.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.039
Very diplomatic from the girl
who had the Bryan Adams poster...

01:21.123 --> 01:23.417
- above her bed for two years.
- Fink.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.836
- Do you have a guilty pleasure?
- No.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.921
- Are you into music?
- Sure.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.799
Monosyllabic Man strikes again.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.927
- We'll have two muffins, please.
- You got them.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.681
Do you think he's dated anyone
since Rachel?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.892
I don't know.
Where would he meet anyone?

01:39.975 --> 01:43.145
- He's either here or in his apartment.
- Maybe he has a secret life.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.689
Maybe he's got a chippy
stowed away in Mt Pilot.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.065
We'll know eventually.

01:47.107 --> 01:51.361
- I say he's a bachelor for life.
- I say there's someone for everyone.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.282
What?

01:55.365 --> 01:56.700
Barry Manilow.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.035
Stop.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.037
Looks like we made it

02:00.120 --> 02:03.415
- Oh, yeah? Spice Girls.
- Duran Duran.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.375
- Dido.
- Olivia Newton-John.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.793
The Macarena.

02:06.877 --> 02:10.547
You and Lane for hours and hours,
for weeks on end.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.175
We were mocking.
You can't mock the mocking.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.844
- It's getting ugly. Let's stop.
- Let's be friends again.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.262
All right.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.351
Stop it.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.699 --> 03:20.534
- What?
- The car won't start.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.203
- What happened?
- I don't know. It's just dead.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.456
- I turn the key, it makes a horrible sound.
- What kind of sound?

03:26.832 --> 03:30.335
Like... You know, but less feminine.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.628
That's the battery.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.672
What did I ever do
to make the battery mad?

03:33.714 --> 03:37.009
Let's see. You've kept the radio on
all night, killing the battery...

03:37.092 --> 03:40.179
you've kept the lights on all night,
you've kept the door open...

03:40.262 --> 03:43.182
which keeps the ceiling light on all night
killing the battery.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.059
Okay, I've done multiple things
to make the battery mad.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.978
- Are you gonna walk?
- I'm wearing heels.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.021
Change your shoes.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.689
- I'd have to change my outfit.
- Do it.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.067
- I'd have to walk upstairs.
- Suddenly I'm living with Zsa Zsa Gabor.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.444
I'm gonna call Michel.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.487
This thing is too small.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.364
- Independence Inn.
- Hold on, Michel.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.783
- That backpack is not too small.
- Miniscule.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.911
Take your schoolbooks
and leave the others.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.245
I need all of my other books.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.247
- You don't need all these.
- I think I do.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.958
- Edna St. Vincent Millay?
- That's my bus book.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.127
- What's the Faulkner?
- My other bus book.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.796
- So just take one bus book.
- The Millay is a biography.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.341
Sometimes on the bus,
when I pull out a biography...

04:17.423 --> 04:20.469
and I think, 'I don't feel like reading
about a person's life'...

04:20.552 --> 04:21.928
then I'll switch to the novel.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.389
And if I'm not into the novel,
I'll switch back.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.474
Still there, Michel?

04:25.557 --> 04:26.850
- Yes, I...
- Hold on.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.561
- What is the Gore Vidal?
- That's my lunch book.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.898
Lose the Vidal or the Faulkner.
You don't need two novels.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.316
Vidal is essays.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.902
But the Eudora Welty's
not essays or biography.

04:37.152 --> 04:40.572
- So, it's another novel. Lose it.
- It's short stories.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.576
- This is a sickness. Michel?
- I am growing very old.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.662
- Come pick me up?
- I'm already here.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.539
Put Carol on the desk and pick me up.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.250
I'm not speaking to Carol.
She ate my low-fat cheese.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.044
Come pick me up
and I will buy you some cheese.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.963
- Low-fat cheese.
- Low-fat cheese.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.799
- Low-fat American cheese.
- Low-fat American cheese.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.300
And a meringue cookie.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.386
- Just get over here.
- Fine.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.848
I made it all fit.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.433
Edna, Bill, Gore, and Eudora,
all safe and sound.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.477
Cool. Forgot your French book.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.063
I know.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.691
I'm carrying my French book.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.694
You so thought that French book
was already in there.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.445
- You have a problem.
- No, I don't.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.031
You're gonna tip over
from the weight of that backpack.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.868
- No, I'm not.
- I'm gonna have to buy you a forklift. Bye.

05:50.225 --> 05:54.479
- I startled you. I didn't mean to.
- That's okay. I'm easily startled.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.940
I'm Mrs. Burdiness,
the guidance counselor.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.110
- Your name's Rory, isn't it? Rory Gilmore?
- Yes.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.945
Hello.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.740
I'd love to sit and talk to you.
Can we do that?

06:04.823 --> 06:05.824
Sure, anytime.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.952
- How about after you finish your lunch?
- That soon?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.414
- I think soon would be good.
- Okay. What's this about?

06:12.498 --> 06:15.334
- We'll talk about it then.
- Not even a hint?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.794
- See you in a little bit.
- Right.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.674
Come in.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.013
- Hello, Rory. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.433
Don't worry about being late
for your next class.

06:31.517 --> 06:34.061
- I'll write you a note if you want.
- Okay.

06:34.144 --> 06:37.064
I know from your records
you're a stickler for punctuality.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.234
I am a stickler, yes.
I only slipped one time last year.

06:40.317 --> 06:44.363
I hit a deer. Actually, he hit me. Or she did.
Or not me, my car.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.200
But then he or she ran away,
and I think it turned out okay.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.619
I didn't see it again,
so I can't definitively say.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.121
But I did look for him or her.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.292
It's a big story.
I'm surprised I don't tell it better.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.503
Why don't we get to the reason
I asked you here?

06:59.711 --> 07:02.798
Headmaster Charleston brought you
to my attention a few weeks ago.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.843
He's worried.
After observing you a bit, I'm worried, too.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.386
You've been observing me?

07:07.469 --> 07:10.389
We've been concerned
about your social behavior here at school.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.515
What about it?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.934
You don't seem to interact much
with other students.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.311
I do, sometimes. In class, all the time.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.189
But rarely outside of class.
At lunch, you're always alone.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.482
I catch up on reading.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.734
That Walkman
makes you very unapproachable.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.819
You approached me.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.238
You jumped out of your skin.
What does that tell you?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.614
That I'm jumpy.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.950
On the Fourth of July, forget it,
I'm a wreck.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.036
When the Stars Hollow orchestra
begins to play in the gazebo...

07:33.120 --> 07:36.290
with the guy banging the cymbals,
it drives me nuts.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.750
Denying a problem
doesn't solve a problem, Rory.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.420
Unless something changes,
this could affect your future.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.339
I don't understand.
I get good grades. Isn't that enough?

07:44.423 --> 07:45.716
You know it's not.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.511
When we make recommendations
to universities on behalf of a student...

07:49.595 --> 07:52.514
that student's social skills
are a big part of it.

07:52.598 --> 07:56.226
- I assume you want to go to a university.
- Absolutely.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.146
Well, universities
do not look kindly on loners.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.149
- But I'm not a loner.
- What do you think a loner is?

08:02.232 --> 08:05.903
Loners are those guys that you see
walking around wearing, I don't know...

08:05.944 --> 08:07.821
out-of-date clothing, bell-bottoms.

08:07.905 --> 08:10.073
And they tend to carry a duffel bag...

08:10.157 --> 08:12.284
with God knows what inside.
That's a loner.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.412
Loners come in all shapes and sizes.
Even pretty girls.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.624
Just try to improve, Rory.
Mix it up with others.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.627
You may even enjoy it. Start with lunch.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.962
I don't suppose there's a Lunchtime...

08:24.004 --> 08:27.299
Reading/Walkman-Listening Club
I can join, is there?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.593
I guess that's no.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.970
- What does she expect?
- She said, 'Mix it up. '

08:32.054 --> 08:33.222
What does that mean?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.807
I guess, going up to strange kids at school
and saying:

08:35.890 --> 08:39.311
'Mind if I awkwardly butt in where
I don't belong and don't wanna be?'

08:39.394 --> 08:41.647
The whole thing's ridiculous.
Chilton is a cult.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.441
- Lorelai, do you know what this is?
- No.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.151
Damn.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.779
I don't know.
Maybe there is something wrong with me.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.073
- Don't say that.
- Maybe I am a loner.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.991
You were mocking my backpack today.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.078
I might be one step away
from carrying a mysterious duffel bag.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.039
Don't you go doubting
who you are, how you should be.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.583
- How dare she do this to you?
- It wasn't just her.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.502
The meeting was Charleston's suggestion.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.672
Well, good. It's time I called on
old Schnickelfritz Charleston...

09:06.755 --> 09:08.882
to tell him to stop messing
with my kid's mind.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.802
I don't like this.
Schools like Chilton try to stamp out...

09:11.885 --> 09:14.763
every vestige of individuality.
I won't let that happen.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.974
It's all fixed. I found a loose terminal.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.643
I reconnected the battery and jumped it.
It's set to go.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.686
Thanks.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.313
No charge for the time I spent
stuck underneath the car.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.439
That's great.

09:24.523 --> 09:28.318
I just want to you know that I overheard,
and you're absolutely right.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.738
I carried a duffel bag and ate lunch
by myself my entire school career...

09:31.822 --> 09:33.907
and I turned out just fine.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.662
I'm still going down there.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.040
Ms. Gilmore is here.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.542
Hello, Mr. Charleston.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.003
- Ms. Gilmore, good to see you.
- Good to be here.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.381
I checked my records to remind myself
why I asked you in...

09:49.464 --> 09:52.050
- only to find you'd called this meeting.
- I did.

09:52.134 --> 09:56.346
I'm surprised. We don't see you often.
We'd forgotten what you look like.

09:56.430 --> 10:00.017
I'm pretty much the same.
Rosy-cheeked, strong of bone, sly of wit.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.269
How nice. So why did you want to see me?

10:02.352 --> 10:06.899
Well, I wanted to talk to you about Rory,
and this ridiculous accusation...

10:06.982 --> 10:09.568
about her being a loner
and how that's something bad.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.613
- Well, it is bad.
- No, it's not bad. It's just her.

10:12.696 --> 10:16.033
I raised Rory to do what she wants,
as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

10:16.074 --> 10:20.787
I don't see how reading a book or listening
to a Walkman is hurting anyone.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.624
- It's hurting her.
- I respectfully disagree.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.751
That doesn't surprise me,
based on my research.

10:25.834 --> 10:26.877
What research?

10:26.960 --> 10:30.881
Seeing your name on the appointment list,
I decided to have a look at the file.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.009
Yes. Rory's file's
been of a lot of interest lately, hasn't it?

10:34.092 --> 10:36.970
I wasn't talking about Rory's file.
I was talking about yours.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.348
- I have a file?
- You most certainly do.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.475
- It's tiny.
- It's very thin.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.977
That's good. It means
I haven't gotten into trouble.

10:44.061 --> 10:48.065
On the contrary, a thin file for a parent
indicates lack of participation.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.526
Now, wait a minute,
I've participated in stuff.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.903
- You attended a bake sale.
- And I sold stuff.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.780
- Then promptly left.
- I was busy.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.407
Without fraternizing
with the other parents at all.

10:57.491 --> 11:01.119
- Busy, like a really tall bee.
- Like mother, like daughter.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.246
Hold on.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.874
Ms. Gilmore, active participation
in Chilton activities for a parent...

11:05.958 --> 11:07.751
- is vitally important.
- But...

11:07.835 --> 11:10.629
This is a list of organizations
sponsored by Chilton.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.215
Parent groups
dedicated to certain specific tasks.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.759
Any one of them would be honored
by your participation.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.929
- Okay, my schedule is...
- We're all tremendously busy.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.682
I hope you're not too busy
to do what's best for you...

11:21.765 --> 11:24.893
- or what's best for Rory, are you?
- No.

11:24.977 --> 11:28.063
- Excellent. Let us know what it'll be.
- I will.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.610
- May I go?
- Yes, you may.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.822
I'm glad you came in today.
It was a good idea.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.324
Yes. I'm just full of good ideas.

11:45.581 --> 11:46.623
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.836
- Yeah, look Fat Albert. Get me a soda?
- Mom, what are you doing here?

11:50.919 --> 11:52.963
You were to meet me in my Latin class...

11:53.046 --> 11:54.756
after meeting
with Headmaster Charleston.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.594
Oh, my, God. I was. I totally forgot.
I'm so sorry.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.096
- What happened? Did you talk to him?
- I did.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.224
I said he was completely
out of line with his treatment of you...

12:04.308 --> 12:06.768
that you're not a loner freak,
you've plenty of friends.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.646
You don't own
a long black leather Matrix coat.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.648
They should fall on their knee socks...

12:11.732 --> 12:15.152
every day that you deign to show up
at that loser school.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.321
- And?
- Then he yelled at me.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.198
- He what?
- He pulled out a file...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.700
- and told me I was a bad Chilton Mom.
- He did not.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.078
- I don't participate in school activities.
- Well, you work.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.165
- And I don't make posters.
- You have no artistic capabilities.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.835
- I don't chaperon school dances.
- Does he know you got pregnant at 16?

12:31.919 --> 12:35.672
Basically, I'm not doing my part
to help further your educational future.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.841
So we both got busted. Great.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.929
Now I have to pick a group or a cause
or sponsor a club or something.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.388
This sucks.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.849
But, hey, I've been thinking.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.895
The whole reason we did this Chilton thing
is for you to get into Harvard, right?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.940
And these fanatics that run your school...

12:53.023 --> 12:56.026
are the ones that write the letters
to the fancy colleges...

12:56.109 --> 12:58.904
saying things like,
'Hey, she's keen, look at her. '

12:58.987 --> 13:01.949
Or, 'Have you seen the 'I'
tattooed on her forehead?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.450
'Cause it sure is a big one. '

13:03.534 --> 13:05.827
You're saying
we should just go along with this?

13:05.911 --> 13:09.289
Go along with it. Talk to some kids.
I'll hang out with their moms...

13:09.373 --> 13:12.042
and we'll get into Harvard,
take over the world...

13:12.125 --> 13:15.045
and buy Chilton
and turn it into a rave club.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.339
- What do you say? Deal?
- Deal.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.426
Look, the Chilton Cheer Society
wear matching hats.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.304
Go Harvard.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.288
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.375
There's a bad draft where I usually sit,
kind of like a big downward gust.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.752
Not exactly
'Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore'...

13:55.836 --> 13:57.171
but it's still uncomfortable...

13:57.254 --> 13:59.798
especially when you're just gotten
your hair to behave.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.383
So can I sit here?

14:02.176 --> 14:03.218
Yeah.

14:03.302 --> 14:04.469
Thanks.

14:07.598 --> 14:08.932
Nice table.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.435
It's much more level
than the one over there.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.520
- Your name is Lori?
- Rory.

14:13.604 --> 14:14.980
Right. Rory.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.857
- What's yours?
- Francie.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.193
- You're Francie?
- No, she's Francie. I'm Ivy.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.154
- Francie's spokesman.
- I am a very important person...

14:22.237 --> 14:24.907
and very important people
never speak for themselves.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.409
I did not know that, but I do now.

14:27.701 --> 14:31.955
That's Azure, Lily, Celine,
Lana, Asia, Anna, and Lem.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.041
- Lem.
- Short for lemon.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.125
Oh, sure.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.044
We were just discussing homecoming.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.837
- Thoughts?
- Great movie.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.006
That was Coming Home. Sorry.

14:41.590 --> 14:45.260
I truly believe the whole homecoming
dance ritual should be put to sleep.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.804
Or at least assigned a new color scheme.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.974
- Rory, huh? Do they call you 'Ror'?
- Not unless provoked.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.142
No nickname?

14:52.226 --> 14:54.978
Actually, Rory is a nickname.
My full name's Lorelai.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.690
- Lorelai. That's a weird name.
- Well, Lem, what can I say?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.984
Sounds Southern. Are you a belle?

15:01.860 --> 15:04.363
No, but apparently I command them.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.533
See you later, Your Highness.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.752
God! You're like a pop-up book from hell.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.712
You were with the Puffs.
How did you do it?

15:20.754 --> 15:22.506
- The who?
- The Chilton Puffs.

15:22.548 --> 15:25.801
- You were at their table.
- I don't know. I just sat down.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.387
Nobody just sits down with them.
You have to be invited.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.013
Paris, it's not the Costa Nostra.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.058
No, they're the Puffs.
The most influential sorority at Chilton.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.394
- Chilton has sororities?
- Only ten worth mentioning.

15:35.477 --> 15:38.397
The Puffs have been number one
for at least the last 50 years.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.566
My mother was a Puff, my aunt was a Puff.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.359
I thought only colleges had sororities.

15:42.401 --> 15:45.195
Connections you make with them
last the rest of your life.

15:45.279 --> 15:47.573
My cousin got her internship
at the Supreme Court...

15:47.614 --> 15:50.325
- because of Sandra Day O'Connor.
- She was a Puff?

15:50.409 --> 15:53.912
Yes. She was Puffed in 1946,
became the president in '47...

15:53.996 --> 15:57.374
and in '48, she moved the group
to the very table you sat at today.

15:57.416 --> 16:00.752
It was a controversial move then,
but she was just that powerful.

16:00.836 --> 16:01.879
I had no idea.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.715
What did you say about me?
Did you tell them you hated me?

16:04.756 --> 16:05.757
I didn't mention you.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.051
I've been killing myself
trying to get invited in.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.804
I spent all of last year
sucking up to Francine Jarvis.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.222
You mean Francie?

16:12.306 --> 16:14.975
- You call her Francie?
- No, someone else did.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.643
I've helped her with her homework...

16:16.727 --> 16:19.563
secured her a prime spot for parking,
organized her locker...

16:19.605 --> 16:22.774
scrunched up the plastic strands
on her pompoms to make them fluffy.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.651
I've done everything except a manicure.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.905
If I had any talent with an orange stick,
I would've done that, too.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.908
I know I'm not the first to say this to you,
but you're insane.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.576
Okay, look.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.288
- I know you and me, we...
- Shouldn't be around each other armed.

16:36.371 --> 16:40.667
Yes. But you have to understand,
I have to get into that group.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.503
I just have to.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.756
My family's name and reputation,
not to mention my entire future...

16:45.797 --> 16:49.384
- all depend on me getting into that group.
- It's just a clique, that's all.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.930
Look, all I'm asking is, please don't say
anything horrible about me.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.806
Don't tell them that you hate me.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.851
Paris, I'm not in their group.
They don't care what I say.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.812
They let you sit at their table
through lunch. You're in.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.983
You know what? Never mind.
Do what you want. I don't care.

17:08.487 --> 17:12.074
- Who the hell names their kid Lemon?
- Someone really into citrus.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.825
Crazy people.

17:14.284 --> 17:18.664
It's just so weird that the one table
I sit down at is home to the secret society.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.916
It's like waking up one day
and realizing everyone in your family...

17:22.000 --> 17:25.002
- can pull their face off.
- Yes, it's exactly like that.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.131
Your mother would like you
to head out to the patio.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.051
- We're barbecuing tonight.
- Thanks.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.763
- Does Grandma have a barbecue?
- I don't know.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.807
Maybe she keeps it in a secret room...

17:36.849 --> 17:39.685
with the paper napkins
and the mismatched sheets.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.188
- Wow. She really is barbecuing.
- Cool.

17:43.272 --> 17:45.274
- What's up, Poppin' Fresh?
- Corn!

17:45.357 --> 17:47.317
Nice. Thank you.

17:50.946 --> 17:54.825
What is this, a refugee camp?
Come inside and eat at the table.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.494
Mom, the whole point of barbecuing
is to eat outside.

17:57.578 --> 17:58.871
Animals eat outside.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.915
Human beings eat inside
with napkins and utensils.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.501
If you want to eat outside,
go hunt down a gazelle.

18:04.543 --> 18:07.045
Make your decision. I'll be inside.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.548
What are the odds
of finding a gazelle here?

18:09.590 --> 18:11.842
- Slim to none.
- Okay, let's go.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.265
- I'm extremely disappointed in you.
- Hold on, Mom.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.937
Okay, go ahead.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.731
I had lunch with Bitty Charleston today.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.233
She told me what happened
with you and the headmaster.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.695
Does someone do nothing but hide
under his desk with a tape recorder?

18:31.737 --> 18:34.364
After all we've gone through
to get Rory in that school...

18:34.448 --> 18:37.034
and then you humiliate all of us
by not being involved?

18:37.075 --> 18:38.660
That's just incomprehensible.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.079
- She wasn't involved either.
- Wow, just sitting here.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.831
You are grown-up. Set an example.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.876
If she's not involved with school,
then she learned it from you.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.295
How hard is it to help out
just once in a while?

18:48.378 --> 18:51.089
Join a group, attend a meeting.
And all for the sake...

18:51.131 --> 18:53.800
Mom, stop already. Please.
I have joined a group, okay?

18:53.884 --> 18:55.594
- You have?
- Yes.

18:55.636 --> 18:56.929
Which one?

18:57.054 --> 19:00.140
I'm gonna join the Booster Club, okay?

19:00.224 --> 19:02.809
The Booster Club. I'm going to boost.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.313
Well, the Boosters
are a very fine organization.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.191
- That's why I picked them.
- They do good work for the school.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.692
All went into the picking process.

19:10.776 --> 19:14.279
And the matching sweatshirts they wear
are just darling.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.701
We're certainly not doing it like last year.

19:19.785 --> 19:22.454
- God, was that awful.
- It wasn't that bad.

19:22.538 --> 19:25.499
When we finished paying
for everybody's stomach to be pumped...

19:25.582 --> 19:27.376
there was no money left to buy bleachers.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.794
The salsa band was wonderful.

19:28.877 --> 19:32.339
- This is giving me a migraine.
- I vote we take a break.

19:32.923 --> 19:36.510
- Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
- It's all right. Can we help you?

19:36.593 --> 19:39.638
Yes, actually.
This isn't the Booster Club, is it?

19:39.721 --> 19:41.098
Yes, it is.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.642
Thank God
you're not wearing sweatshirts.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.312
You know what? Never mind.
I'm Lorelai Gilmore. Sorry I'm late.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.231
Please, you haven't missed a thing.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.401
So far, we had coffee,
debated Carolyn Masters' nose job.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.944
- Too pug.
- Too smushed.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.572
And we started arguing
about our fall fundraiser.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.115
I suggested we take a break.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.368
I ignored the suggestion.
And now here we are. You're up to date.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.661
Have a seat.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.956
Lorelai Gilmore. You're Emily's daughter.

20:05.998 --> 20:07.499
Yeah. You know my mother?

20:07.583 --> 20:10.294
Very well. We're on
the Philharmonic Committee together.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.963
- She told me to keep an eye out for you.
- That's nice.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.923
She wasn't sure you'd show up.

20:15.007 --> 20:17.467
So, fall fundraiser. What do we do?

20:17.509 --> 20:20.512
Last year, we had the usual luncheon
with the silent auction...

20:20.554 --> 20:23.056
- and a salsa band.
- A terrific salsa band.

20:23.140 --> 20:26.351
But every guest ended up in the hospital
with food poisoning...

20:26.393 --> 20:29.021
before the auction started,
and we wound up losing money.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.356
- Whoops.
- Yes, it's quite a whoops, isn't it?

20:31.440 --> 20:33.692
This year, we've decided
to do a fashion show.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.068
That sounds fun.

20:35.152 --> 20:38.155
- Well, Aubrey here works at Saks.
- Used to work at Saks.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.032
Sorry. Used to work at Saks.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.576
She got several designers
to donate their clothes.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.746
Now we're just trying to find
a suitable caterer and location...

20:45.829 --> 20:48.832
- and someone to plan the event.
- It's all going very well.

20:48.916 --> 20:52.628
- I still say we approach Chateau Memsie.
- That space is too small, Mena.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.671
How about something
more young and fun?

20:54.755 --> 20:57.216
- You know my stepdaughter, Kimberly...
- Sarah?

20:57.257 --> 20:58.926
Right, Sarah.

20:59.176 --> 21:02.012
Anyhow, she told me
about this new club called The Digs...

21:02.054 --> 21:05.849
She's been married a month and can't
remember the names of her stepchildren.

21:05.891 --> 21:08.977
...so the booths are in these pits,
and there's sand everywhere...

21:09.061 --> 21:10.020
Stop her.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.981
I don't think that's exactly
what we're looking for.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.399
I run an inn.

21:14.483 --> 21:15.651
- You do?
- Which one?

21:15.734 --> 21:17.861
The Independence Inn. It's in Stars Hollow.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.072
I've been there. It's lovely.

21:20.155 --> 21:24.576
We have a terrific chef who's never once
hospitalized an entire function.

21:24.952 --> 21:29.456
I don't know exactly what you're looking
for, but we do functions there all the time.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.834
- Who's your function coordinator?
- I am, actually.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.419
Since it's for charity,
I could get you a good price.

21:34.503 --> 21:37.589
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask.
Are you from heaven?

21:37.756 --> 21:40.259
- You like the idea?
- I love the idea.

21:40.342 --> 21:44.847
I love it so much, we can finally
take that break Aubrey's been dying for.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.058
Well, this is very exciting.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.228
Mind if I come out there tomorrow
to take a look at the place?

21:51.270 --> 21:55.148
- Make sure it's big enough for the runway.
- Yeah, sure. I'll be there all day.

21:55.232 --> 21:58.360
So, a fashion show, huh?
Are we gonna get any famous models?

21:58.443 --> 22:00.404
- Excuse me?
- To model the clothes.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.990
Any chance I'll finally see Kate Moss
eat something?

22:03.073 --> 22:06.368
- No, we're the models.
- We? Who's we?

22:06.451 --> 22:08.912
We. The women in this room. Me, you. We.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.289
- Me?
- Yes.

22:11.206 --> 22:14.543
By the way, welcome to the Boosters.
We're thrilled to have you.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.461
Thanks. That's great.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.633
Yours is worse than mine.

22:21.717 --> 22:24.178
They totally just snuck
that modeling thing in.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.679
My mom's a model.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.473
Maybe I'll get to date
Leonardo DiCaprio now.

22:28.557 --> 22:31.018
Plus, now I have to plan
the whole stupid thing.

22:31.101 --> 22:34.229
Lorelai Gilmore.
Nope, doesn't sound model-y enough.

22:34.313 --> 22:37.357
You need something that stands out more.
How about Waffle?

22:37.441 --> 22:39.776
We could call you that
and say you're from Belgium.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.029
I'm crabby.
I need to do something about it.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.322
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.449
I went to my first Booster meeting
last night.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.326
- Did Bitty tell you?
- No, she did not.

22:47.367 --> 22:51.330
Maybe she's still stuck under that desk.
You might wanna send someone out there.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.874
It's nice to hear
you're finally getting involved.

22:53.957 --> 22:58.295
Yes. In fact, we're planning
a charity fashion show next weekend...

22:58.378 --> 23:02.174
- and I volunteered to organize it.
- Well, good for you.

23:02.216 --> 23:06.136
Since I know how concerned you are
about how Rory's perceived at Chilton...

23:06.178 --> 23:09.306
I knew you'd want to be involved,
so you're one of the models.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.767
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, so it's next Saturday.

23:11.850 --> 23:14.895
Be there at 4:00,
and we'll provide hair and makeup.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.856
- You can't be serious.
- We'll need your measurements, also.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.274
This is ridiculous.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.818
You said you wanted me to be involved.
I'm involved.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.863
Don't you want to do your part
to ensure Rory's future?

23:24.947 --> 23:27.074
- All right.
- Start measuring.

23:27.491 --> 23:30.869
- You feel better now?
- Waffle's very happy.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.755
Sit with us, please.

23:43.757 --> 23:44.842
Okay.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.055
Here she is.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.140
Welcome.

23:52.224 --> 23:55.686
- We talked. We find you fascinating.
- Like the monkey habitat.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.938
So we've decided
to extend an invite to you.

23:58.021 --> 24:02.234
- You can eat here anytime you like.
- Wow. That's nice of you. Thanks.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.321
- Can I ask about this whole sorority thing?
- Pardon?

24:06.572 --> 24:08.907
- Sorori-what?
- I thought you guys...

24:08.949 --> 24:11.577
- We've no idea what you're talking about.
- Right.

24:11.660 --> 24:15.038
After all, what's the point
of a secret society if it's not a secret?

24:15.080 --> 24:17.249
The whole school apparently
knows about it.

24:17.332 --> 24:20.002
No one has proof. It's just folklore.

24:20.085 --> 24:22.921
- Like Snow White and Rose Red.
- Or Mariah Carey's crackup.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.715
Have you heard her fan message recently?

24:24.756 --> 24:27.885
She's fine and is currently staring
at a really beautiful rainbow.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.595
Survivor, hello.

24:30.429 --> 24:33.724
- Friend of yours?
- Paris? Oh, well...

24:33.765 --> 24:35.559
- Too intense.
- Way too intense.

24:35.601 --> 24:38.854
- She comes from a long line of us, though.
- I hate nepotism.

24:38.937 --> 24:40.898
It, however,
does make the world go round.

24:40.981 --> 24:45.027
You know, Paris, while, yes,
a little intense...

24:45.110 --> 24:46.486
is also very smart.

24:46.570 --> 24:50.073
I drop a box of matches on the floor,
she can tell me how many there are?

24:50.157 --> 24:53.619
She's editor of the paper,
amazing writer, plus funny.

24:54.495 --> 24:56.955
- She's funny?
- Yeah, hilarious.

24:57.122 --> 25:00.083
I mean, the times
that we have spent laughing together...

25:00.125 --> 25:02.628
I tell you, she's a regular Gary Mule Deer.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.339
She asked you to talk her up, didn't she?

25:05.422 --> 25:07.508
- No, not at all.
- Right.

25:07.591 --> 25:11.303
Really. I think she's actually thinking
of joining another non-existent group.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.931
- What?
- But her family's fully Puffed.

25:14.014 --> 25:17.476
Don't know. Maybe I heard wrong.
But I think that's what I heard her say.

25:17.518 --> 25:18.894
A voluntary defector.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.646
- Francie...
- I know.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.149
- Paris?
- Yeah?

25:24.316 --> 25:27.110
I think the wall can hold itself up just fine,
don't you?

25:27.152 --> 25:28.570
- What?
- You should sit.

25:28.654 --> 25:29.988
- Sit?
- Here.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.406
- Sit there?
- Or here.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.450
Or anywhere, for that matter.

25:33.992 --> 25:37.079
Unless you've got somewhere else to be.
Another table, perhaps?

25:37.162 --> 25:38.121
Another table?

25:38.205 --> 25:40.791
No, you have to sit right here. Come.

25:42.209 --> 25:46.421
Okay. I guess I can sit.
For a little while, anyhow.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.841
Okay. So...

25:49.091 --> 25:52.052
- have we discussed homecoming yet?
- Not to my knowledge.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.347
I believe the whole homecoming
dance ritual should be put to sleep.

25:56.557 --> 25:59.476
In the dining room. And don't drip water
on the floor, please.

25:59.518 --> 26:00.936
- Michel, did...
- Five minutes ago.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.938
He brought the wrong color.
I sent him back.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.398
- When will he...
- Twenty minutes...

26:04.481 --> 26:06.316
or I'll hunt him down and shave his beard.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.527
- Now we need...
- Yes, thanks for reminding me.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.653
- Anything...
- No.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.946
I'm going in the dining room.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.365
Come and get me
if you need me to finish a sentence.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.700
Will do.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.833
- Hey, how's it coming?
- Working on it.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.710
- This cannot tilt.
- I know this.

26:24.751 --> 26:28.672
Women in heels will be walking on it.
Make it not tilt.

26:29.506 --> 26:31.383
- The lettuce is dry.
- What does that mean?

26:31.466 --> 26:34.011
- How attached are you to salad?
- It's free to see anyone.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.721
I won't make a salad with dry lettuce.

26:35.804 --> 26:37.055
- What's the alternative?
- Soup.

26:37.139 --> 26:38.182
- Fine.
- Okay, great.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.391
- Sookie?
- Yeah?

26:39.474 --> 26:41.768
- Did we pay for the lettuce already?
- Yes.

26:41.852 --> 26:44.396
- See if you can put it in the soup.
- Gotcha.

26:45.397 --> 26:47.733
- Thank God. You brought Bert.
- Right here.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.109
My men. Follow me.

26:49.193 --> 26:52.946
You do tell people that you're the one
that named my toolbox, right?

26:53.030 --> 26:54.865
- Toolbox. Dirty.
- Oh, jeez.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.325
- Okay, move.
- What?

26:56.408 --> 26:59.077
- I want Luke to look at it.
- I put this thing together.

26:59.119 --> 27:03.290
Yes. And I loved your work in Pisa.
Now get out of the way, please.

27:03.665 --> 27:07.544
- Okay, so what seems to be the problem?
- The problem... That's not funny.

27:07.586 --> 27:09.505
I like it when you're stressed.

27:09.588 --> 27:12.382
- Man, he put this up all wrong.
- Can you can fix it?

27:12.424 --> 27:14.259
- I don't know. I'll see.
- You can fix it.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.428
Say it all you want, it doesn't make it true.

27:16.512 --> 27:18.722
- You can fix it.
- Not with you hovering, I can't.

27:18.764 --> 27:21.099
Okay, I'm leaving. And you can fix it.

27:23.936 --> 27:25.437
Eva, hi.

27:25.521 --> 27:27.940
- God! The place looks wonderful.
- Thank you.

27:28.023 --> 27:31.276
Let me show you to the room
where we're all getting ready.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.528
Fix it yet?

27:32.611 --> 27:35.823
- The moron used the wrong supports.
- Please tell me you can fix it.

27:35.906 --> 27:38.575
- If I told you I couldn't, would you accept?
- No.

27:38.617 --> 27:40.285
- I can fix it.
- Thank you.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.412
So, we're right back here.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.206
Eva, the room's right back here.

27:44.289 --> 27:47.626
- Him. There. Man with tools. Who is that?
- That's Luke.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.127
- I like Luke.
- What?

27:49.211 --> 27:51.964
He's adorable. And he looks strong.
Is he strong?

27:52.005 --> 27:54.633
I don't think he's gonna be
in a sideshow anytime soon...

27:54.716 --> 27:56.468
but he can get the lid off a pickle jar.

27:56.510 --> 27:58.971
- Is he single?
- Well, yeah, he is single.

27:59.054 --> 28:03.308
- What kind of women does he like?
- I don't know. The ones with heads.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.687
You know, I don't really know
what Luke's taste in women is.

28:07.354 --> 28:10.023
Why don't you just go in the back,
go to the right...

28:10.107 --> 28:13.318
you'll find the dressing room.
I'll be there in a sec.

28:13.819 --> 28:16.989
- Hi, Mom.
- The place isn't nearly done yet.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.408
Why don't you just go in the back
and get ready?

28:19.491 --> 28:20.951
See the clothes? What am I wearing?

28:21.034 --> 28:23.120
I don't know.
I had them hang them in the room.

28:23.162 --> 28:26.081
I hope they're not tasteless
or zebra-striped or spandex.

28:26.165 --> 28:28.876
One good way to find out
is to go on back and take a peek.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.878
- You have to get ready, too.
- In a sec.

28:30.961 --> 28:33.672
If I'm doing this, you're doing this.
I mean it.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.217
- You fixed it.
- Yep. For the time being.

28:37.301 --> 28:40.012
But I'm gonna stick around
to make sure nothing happens.

28:40.512 --> 28:41.930
- Okay.
- What?

28:42.014 --> 28:43.640
- Don't want me to?
- I didn't say that.

28:43.682 --> 28:46.018
- Any reason I shouldn't?
- It's fine.

28:46.059 --> 28:47.603
Because I'm just doing this for you.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.938
If this thing goes
and someone breaks their neck...

28:50.022 --> 28:53.108
- Luke, stick around.
- All right, if you insist.

28:57.654 --> 29:01.366
- Hey. Why aren't you dressed yet?
- I was waiting for you.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.660
Oh, my God. You're a paranoid woman.

29:03.994 --> 29:07.164
- I'm Emily Gilmore.
- Okay, here you go.

29:07.456 --> 29:10.459
- Where's Lorelai Gilmore?
- Right here.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.462
- You two are together.
- What?

29:13.545 --> 29:15.672
- You're the mother-daughter team.
- No, I'm...

29:15.756 --> 29:17.925
I have outfits
for one mother-daughter team.

29:18.008 --> 29:20.802
Your names are on the outfits. You're it.

29:22.513 --> 29:23.889
Oh, my God.

29:24.473 --> 29:25.891
I want to welcome you here...

29:25.974 --> 29:28.936
to the Chilton Booster Club's
Annual Fall Festival Fundraiser...

29:29.019 --> 29:32.481
where all proceeds from the evening
go directly into the refurbishing...

29:32.564 --> 29:34.233
of the Chilton auditorium.

29:37.736 --> 29:40.239
But enough about the kids.
Tonight is about us.

29:40.322 --> 29:42.324
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen...

29:42.407 --> 29:45.661
Saks presents a fabulous
fall fashion extravaganza.

30:57.566 --> 31:01.028
Well, I must say this was definitely better
than the salsa band.

31:01.111 --> 31:02.821
The people loved it. Did you hear them?

31:02.863 --> 31:05.699
- God, who picked that music?
- That'd be me.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.494
- The whole thing was terrific.
- Thank you.

31:08.535 --> 31:12.164
And hiring that actor to play
a horrible, rude, annoying Frenchman...

31:12.247 --> 31:14.791
- What a riot.
- Yeah, I thought that'd be fun.

31:14.875 --> 31:18.712
If you'd plan all these things, we wouldn't
have any more stupid meetings.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.758
Don't you want to see how long it takes
for Aubrey to finally learn that kid's name?

31:22.841 --> 31:26.053
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'll see you at the next meeting.

31:26.136 --> 31:29.348
Great job.
Really, it's the best event we've ever had.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.975
- Thanks, Ginger. Bye, Mena.
- Bye-bye.

31:35.062 --> 31:38.857
- What are you looking so 'ha-ha' about?
- I'm not looking 'ha-ha. '

31:38.899 --> 31:41.485
- Yes, you are.
- All right, whatever you say.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.445
Come on, Mom. Fess up.

31:43.529 --> 31:46.406
- Big success tonight.
- Seemed to be.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.117
The ladies were thrilled. They adore you.

31:49.201 --> 31:51.870
Yes, well, that's because I'm adorable.

31:51.954 --> 31:53.956
- Funny, isn't it?
- What's funny?

31:54.039 --> 31:58.418
How nicely you seem to be fitting
into the world that you ran away from.

32:00.295 --> 32:04.049
Good night, Lorelai. Congratulations.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.068
- Is that you?
- Nope.

32:23.485 --> 32:25.779
- How was it?
- Fine.

32:26.196 --> 32:28.699
It ran smoothly,
and the food was amazing.

32:28.782 --> 32:32.161
- Michel only made three people cry.
- How was the fashion show?

32:32.244 --> 32:35.080
I walked up and down the ramp,
looked pouty and sexy...

32:35.164 --> 32:36.707
and now I'm ready for rehab.

32:36.748 --> 32:39.877
- I brought you some Booster cake.
- Put it in the fridge, please.

32:39.918 --> 32:40.919
Okay.

32:41.003 --> 32:43.505
- How's Grandma?
- Good.

32:43.589 --> 32:46.842
I assume that's your piece of cake
and mine is safe in the fridge.

32:46.925 --> 32:48.093
You're cute.

32:48.177 --> 32:51.221
- So, what'd you wear?
- Look at the time. I'm going to bed.

32:51.263 --> 32:54.391
- Nobody took a picture of you?
- No. Can you believe that?

32:54.474 --> 32:57.895
- You're holding on tightly to that purse.
- I really love this purse.

32:57.936 --> 32:59.438
You have pictures in there.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.815
- You calling your mother a liar?
- Yes, I am.

33:01.899 --> 33:03.984
That's why I ate your cake.

33:07.529 --> 33:09.406
- Oh, my God!
- Be nice.

33:09.740 --> 33:12.409
- You look like Nancy Reagan.
- Now, how is that nice?

33:12.451 --> 33:13.869
I don't believe this.

33:13.952 --> 33:17.122
You look so completely different.
Elegant, understated.

33:17.206 --> 33:20.459
I was wearing underwear with propellers
if that makes you feel better.

33:20.542 --> 33:23.837
- I'm going to bed.
- I'll send the Secret Service up.

33:24.254 --> 33:27.633
By the way,
I would put on your good pajamas...

33:27.674 --> 33:30.469
the cute ones with the cakes on them,
and brush your hair...

33:30.552 --> 33:33.138
- and put on a little lip gloss.
- Why?

33:33.388 --> 33:36.934
- You're being kidnapped tonight.
- Excuse me?

33:37.809 --> 33:40.562
- I got a call today from Francie.
- What?

33:40.646 --> 33:43.857
She said she and her friends
would come in while you're sleeping...

33:43.941 --> 33:47.319
wake you up, kidnap you, and take
you out to breakfast in your pajamas.

33:47.402 --> 33:48.737
Why would they do that?

33:48.821 --> 33:51.532
- Apparently, it's fun.
- That doesn't sound fun.

33:51.615 --> 33:54.493
Told me to leave the key under the mat
and money on the table.

33:54.576 --> 33:56.078
And you said yes to this insanity?

33:56.161 --> 33:58.622
I told you not to become a soc,
but you didn't listen.

33:58.705 --> 34:02.000
I can't believe you'd let some strange girls
come traipsing in...

34:02.042 --> 34:05.170
and take away your only child,
your precious baby girl...

34:05.254 --> 34:07.548
off to God knows where
in the middle of the night.

34:07.631 --> 34:10.592
If it's someplace with doughnuts,
bring me one, okay?

34:11.009 --> 34:12.886
- Hey!
- Christmas cards.

34:13.262 --> 34:15.848
More like your grandmother every day.

34:22.187 --> 34:26.190
- Mom, my kidnappers are here.
- Okay, have fun.

34:39.371 --> 34:42.708
- Get the light.
- I can't find it.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.377
Surprise!

34:45.835 --> 34:48.255
- What's going on?
- Rise and shine.

34:48.338 --> 34:50.047
You can grab shoes but no socks.

34:50.132 --> 34:53.677
Wow, this is totally unexpected.
I'm completely surprised.

34:53.719 --> 34:54.844
You looked it.

34:54.887 --> 34:58.515
Okay, let's move.
We still got a couple more girls to get.

35:02.978 --> 35:06.190
So, that's how you look
when you've just woken up?

35:06.982 --> 35:08.066
Yeah.

35:09.693 --> 35:11.778
Nothing in my life is fair.

35:15.532 --> 35:17.409
Okay, a little further.

35:20.704 --> 35:21.872
Sorry.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.085
Okay, that's far enough.

35:27.169 --> 35:31.215
Ladies, here on this spot,
tonight in this place...

35:31.256 --> 35:33.842
where so many others
have come before you...

35:33.926 --> 35:37.596
- we invite you to join us.
- Ladies, remove your blindfolds.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.975
- We're at Chilton.
- Keys, please.

35:42.142 --> 35:45.270
- What are we doing at Chilton?
- Be quiet. We're being Puffed.

35:45.354 --> 35:48.273
What you're about to do and say
will remain forever...

35:48.315 --> 35:52.110
between the members of the Puffs,
and only the members of the Puffs.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.869
This is the headmaster's office.
How did she get the keys?

36:00.953 --> 36:02.412
I'm sure he didn't give them to her.

36:02.454 --> 36:05.791
Stop it. We are making
very important social contacts here.

36:05.874 --> 36:08.919
I'm not looking for social contacts.
I have friends. I'm fine.

36:09.002 --> 36:13.048
How nice it must be to be you. Maybe
someday I'll stumble into a Disney movie...

36:13.131 --> 36:14.842
and be transported into your body.

36:14.925 --> 36:17.761
After living there awhile,
I'll realize the beauty of myself.

36:17.803 --> 36:21.098
But until that moment,
I'm going to go in there and become a Puff.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.016
Now get out of my way.

36:41.076 --> 36:44.621
The historical bell of Chilton,
120 years old.

36:44.746 --> 36:48.083
Every member of the Puffs has stood here,
under the cover of night...

36:48.167 --> 36:50.794
to pledge her lifelong devotion to us.

36:51.503 --> 36:54.882
I pledge myself to the Puffs.
Loyal I will always be.

36:55.132 --> 36:57.634
A 'P' to start, two 'F's' at the end...

36:58.051 --> 37:00.262
and a 'U' sitting in between.

37:01.013 --> 37:02.639
Anne Sexton, right?

37:02.723 --> 37:06.101
Once you've finished your oath,
you will ring the bell three times.

37:06.185 --> 37:07.561
- Rory?
- Yeah?

37:07.769 --> 37:09.104
You first.

37:16.236 --> 37:19.990
- I pledge myself to the Puffs.
- You have to hold the candle.

37:22.534 --> 37:26.038
I pledge myself to the Puffs.
Loyal I'll always be.

37:26.121 --> 37:27.664
Sing out, Louise.

37:27.748 --> 37:31.376
A 'P' to start, two 'F's' at the end,
and a 'U' sitting in between.

37:32.586 --> 37:35.214
I wouldn't do that again, Ms. Gilmore.

37:38.008 --> 37:41.970
Disappointment, disillusionment,
frustration, astonishment.

37:42.054 --> 37:45.307
I suppose you could say
I am experiencing all of these emotions.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.726
Finding some of Chilton's
best and brightest...

37:47.768 --> 37:50.729
acting in such a destructive, immoral,
and illegal manner...

37:50.771 --> 37:52.606
will make all of us think long and hard...

37:52.689 --> 37:54.900
about the manner
in which we're educating you.

37:54.983 --> 37:58.821
But that is all in the future.
How do we handle this now?

37:58.904 --> 38:01.448
Well, suspension will be considered.

38:01.615 --> 38:05.035
Detention and extra credit
to maintain your current GPA standing...

38:05.077 --> 38:07.204
- will be a given.
- This is unbelievable.

38:07.246 --> 38:09.623
- What was that, Ms. Gilmore?
- Nothing.

38:09.706 --> 38:12.626
I heard you mumbling something
in a rather disgruntled tone.

38:12.709 --> 38:16.213
- I'd like to know what it was.
- I said, 'This is unbelievable. '

38:16.296 --> 38:18.215
And why is this unbelievable?

38:18.257 --> 38:20.384
I didn't even want to be here
in the first place.

38:20.467 --> 38:21.760
Now, Ms. Gilmore...

38:21.844 --> 38:23.762
Things were going fine.
My grades were good.

38:23.846 --> 38:25.806
I joined the paper. My routine was down.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.934
- Your routine was...
- I have friends. I have a steady boyfriend.

38:29.017 --> 38:30.644
My mother and I are freakishly linked.

38:30.727 --> 38:32.771
Lane and I are best friends
since kindergarten.

38:32.855 --> 38:34.857
But you don't see it
'cause I don't live here.

38:34.940 --> 38:36.900
If you don't see it, then it mustn't be true.

38:36.984 --> 38:39.570
You call me to lecture me
because I'd rather read...

38:39.611 --> 38:41.697
than discuss
the euthanasia of homecoming.

38:41.780 --> 38:42.739
Your reading...

38:42.823 --> 38:45.534
You told me and my mom
I needed to socialize. If I didn't...

38:45.617 --> 38:48.245
it would be frowned upon
and hurt me getting into Harvard.

38:48.287 --> 38:50.664
- Yes, we did say that.
- So I did it.

38:50.747 --> 38:53.584
- I sat down at a table, a random table.
- Random?

38:53.625 --> 38:57.754
The next thing I know, I'm being pulled out
of my bed at midnight and I'm blindfolded.

38:57.838 --> 39:01.133
Before I know it, I end up here
with the Ya-Ya Sisterhood...

39:01.216 --> 39:03.427
reciting poetry and lighting candles.

39:03.468 --> 39:06.972
Now I'm gonna be suspended because
I was trying to do what you told me?

39:07.055 --> 39:08.056
What's fair about that?

39:08.140 --> 39:10.851
Headmaster Charleston,
the parents are starting to arrive.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.060
Thank you, Mrs. Traiger.

39:12.144 --> 39:16.273
We'll continue this conversation tomorrow
and for many days after that.

39:16.315 --> 39:18.442
You may go. Ms. Gilmore.

39:19.485 --> 39:22.279
I think that maybe you and I
should talk some more.

39:22.321 --> 39:23.739
About what?

39:23.989 --> 39:28.452
About the fact that though I do feel
it is important that students socialize...

39:29.244 --> 39:33.165
possibly we may have been
a little hasty to judge in your case.

39:33.248 --> 39:37.544
Really? So does that mean
that you might reconsider my suspension?

39:37.628 --> 39:40.339
You're an excellent student.
You deserve to go to Harvard.

39:40.422 --> 39:42.841
I wouldn't want to stand
in the way of that.

39:42.883 --> 39:45.511
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Thank you.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.564
What happened?
The reception on the phone sucked.

39:57.648 --> 40:00.275
All I heard was 'Rory,' 'Chilton,'
and 'Get down here. '

40:00.359 --> 40:01.527
Who's butt do I have to kick?

40:01.610 --> 40:03.654
- We didn't go to breakfast.
- What's this about?

40:03.695 --> 40:07.199
We came here, broke into the
headmaster's office as the big initiation.

40:07.282 --> 40:10.327
- Those stupid girls.
- Part of the initiation was ringing a bell.

40:10.410 --> 40:13.080
That's what I was doing
when security came. They called you.

40:13.163 --> 40:15.040
You got busted for ringing a bell?

40:15.123 --> 40:17.084
- That's it? Bell ringing?
- Yes.

40:17.543 --> 40:20.128
- Were you at least smoking a Cuban cigar?
- Mom.

40:20.212 --> 40:21.797
No. I mean, 'Bad girl.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.007
'How many times
have I said not to ring bells?

40:24.049 --> 40:26.885
'They can dent or scratch,
and they make dogs crazy.

40:26.969 --> 40:28.720
'Think you're
the Hunchback of Notre Dame?

40:28.762 --> 40:31.890
- 'Are you French? Circular? No. '
- I'm walking to the car now.

40:31.974 --> 40:35.853
Hold on. How much trouble are you in?
Should I go talk to the headmaster?

40:35.894 --> 40:39.147
- No, I think it's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

40:42.568 --> 40:44.486
Was it a big bell at least?

40:49.908 --> 40:52.828
- Good party yesterday.
- Yeah, not bad.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.122
Yeah, I liked the new look.

40:55.205 --> 40:58.709
- It was very high-class substitute teacher.
- Exactly what I was going for.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.335
- Coffee?
- To go.

41:00.419 --> 41:01.503
Okay.

41:04.131 --> 41:08.051
Luke, I feel a little weird
even mentioning this to you.

41:08.427 --> 41:10.971
- What?
- Yesterday, I saw you talking to Eva.

41:11.054 --> 41:14.057
- She's in my Booster Club.
- Yeah, I know who she is.

41:14.141 --> 41:15.309
Well, good.

41:15.392 --> 41:18.812
So anyhow, I saw you guys talking alone,
and it seemed kind of private.

41:18.896 --> 41:22.900
And she mentioned earlier
that you didn't make her, you know, gag.

41:22.941 --> 41:25.861
So I just figured you guys
were making plans to hang out.

41:25.944 --> 41:29.239
And, see, the thing is,
I just think it would be a little weird...

41:29.281 --> 41:31.825
if you started dating a Chilton mom.

41:32.075 --> 41:35.412
Look, I know I have no right
to say anything to you, but it's just...

41:35.454 --> 41:36.788
If you did date her...

41:36.830 --> 41:39.875
I'm in the Booster Club with her,
which means I'll hear things.

41:39.958 --> 41:41.418
I don't know, it's just...

41:41.460 --> 41:45.088
I'd like to keep that Chilton life
separate from my Stars Hollow life.

41:45.130 --> 41:48.467
So if there's any way
that you could not date her...

41:48.759 --> 41:50.886
that would be really great.

41:51.929 --> 41:54.640
- Boy, I tell you, you've got nerve.
- Okay.

41:54.681 --> 41:57.893
- I know this is your private business.
- It is my private business.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.728
You don't see any validity to my side?

41:59.811 --> 42:02.105
I'm a grown man.
You can't tell me who to date.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.525
I'm not telling you who to date,
but who not to date.

42:04.608 --> 42:05.943
You can't tell me that either.

42:05.984 --> 42:09.530
I will date who I like, and if that
screws with your plans, then sorry.

42:09.613 --> 42:11.532
If you don't wanna hear things,
don't listen.

42:11.615 --> 42:13.367
If you don't like it, just deal with it.

42:13.450 --> 42:15.619
- Okay, I'll just deal with it.
- Good.

42:15.661 --> 42:18.956
I just thought if something
was going to affect our friendship...

42:18.997 --> 42:20.332
that you might care about that.

42:20.374 --> 42:24.253
Because if the situation was reversed,
then I would care. But, hey, that's me.

42:24.336 --> 42:26.839
So go ahead. Date her, marry her.

42:26.922 --> 42:29.508
Make her Mrs. Backwards Baseball Cap.

42:29.758 --> 42:32.469
Live happily ever after. See if I care.

42:33.095 --> 42:35.222
And by the way, I wasn't asking her out.

42:35.305 --> 42:38.225
I was giving her directions
for the quickest way to Hartford.

42:38.308 --> 42:39.351
It was very romantic.

42:39.434 --> 42:43.355
I said, 'You take a right at Deerfield
and catch the I-5 and take it south. '

42:43.438 --> 42:45.107
Oh, man, hot stuff.

42:46.817 --> 42:49.194
- That is so typical of you.
- What?

42:49.945 --> 42:52.239
That is not the quickest way
back to Hartford.

42:52.322 --> 42:54.950
Everybody knows you take
Maine to Cherry to Linwood...

42:55.033 --> 42:57.494
and then grab the I-11.
Everybody knows that, Luke.

42:57.578 --> 42:59.872
Everybody, apparently, but you.

43:26.732 --> 43:29.818
- Do you mind?
- No.

43:30.152 --> 43:31.361
Thanks.
