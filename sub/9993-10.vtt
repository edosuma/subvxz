<i>There's you and me And all of the people with nothing to do</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:12.690
<i>Nothing to lose and it's you and me</i>

00:15.125 --> 00:15.983
Damn.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.493

01:23.145 --> 01:24.329
Cock-a-doodle-do.

01:26.036 --> 01:27.158
Cock-a-doodle who?

01:28.752 --> 01:29.972
Never mind.
I take that back.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.880
It's way too early for this kind of talk.

01:33.095 --> 01:35.318
Do you know that it's barely 5:00?

01:36.580 --> 01:37.285
I know.

01:40.472 --> 01:41.751
Is that a grocery list?

01:44.020 --> 01:44.724
Kind of.

01:44.773 --> 01:49.149
It's a list of things Ariel thinks she needs
for her slumber party tomorrow night.

01:49.534 --> 01:51.915
Rice cakes, sunflower seeds? What?

01:52.169 --> 01:54.341
Ariel's trying to make friends
with this girl named Celeste

01:54.392 --> 01:55.980
who is allergic to gluten.

01:58.801 --> 02:00.239
This is why you're up so early?

02:02.468 --> 02:03.226
No.

02:03.679 --> 02:05.164
I hit a girl with my car.

02:06.872 --> 02:08.044
In a dream.

02:08.877 --> 02:09.664
Okay.

02:12.854 --> 02:14.025
Was anyone else with you?

02:15.100 --> 02:15.741
No.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.827
Was it nighttime, daytime?

02:19.041 --> 02:19.726
It was night.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.291
Any idea where the street might have been?

02:23.433 --> 02:24.680
What do you mean?
Like a name?

02:24.792 --> 02:26.117
A name would be good.

02:28.438 --> 02:30.688
Well, I remember
I felt like it was that area

02:31.636 --> 02:34.028
near the hospital
where all those houses are.

02:34.189 --> 02:35.408
Okay, this is easy.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.520
I'm glad you feel so relieved.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.202
Let's just agree,
from now until the end of time,

02:40.847 --> 02:42.400
that you don't drive alone at night

02:42.451 --> 02:45.414
in that area by the hospital
where the houses are.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.687
What? You're upset?

02:48.738 --> 02:50.422
I'm just frustrated. That's all.

02:50.473 --> 02:51.295
Why?

02:52.276 --> 02:54.339
We've been at this for a while now.

02:54.688 --> 02:55.435
And?

02:55.685 --> 02:56.767
All this skepticism.

02:56.818 --> 02:57.971
This isn't skepticism.

02:58.756 --> 03:00.796
This is the exact opposite of skepticism.

03:01.175 --> 03:03.403
This is absolute conviction followed by--

03:03.454 --> 03:04.906
and this is the important part--

03:04.956 --> 03:07.227
by completely logical plan of action.

03:07.278 --> 03:08.004
Really?

03:08.055 --> 03:08.773
Truly.

03:08.824 --> 03:09.500
It's like that joke.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.307
The guy walks in to the doctor's office, he says, "Hey, Doc,

03:11.358 --> 03:14.536
"my arm hurts when I raise it like this." And the doctor says,

03:14.691 --> 03:16.206
"Fine. Don't raise it like that."

03:16.966 --> 03:18.799
We can't stop the night from coming,

03:18.850 --> 03:21.421
we can't stop the girl from stepping out into the road.

03:21.472 --> 03:23.414
But if you're not in the road in your car,

03:23.465 --> 03:24.478
you're not gonna hit her.

03:24.885 --> 03:26.477
Allison, smile,
for God's sake.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.052
This is a tragedy we can absolutely avoid.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.372
This is a gift.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.372
Now I say we celebrate...

03:33.624 --> 03:34.544
back in bed.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.678
Would you like me to check your oil?

03:42.259 --> 03:43.173
You're kidding me.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.406
You guys still do that?

03:44.815 --> 03:46.545
Well, you're at the full service island, Miss.

03:48.593 --> 03:49.643
Damn it.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.494
So would you like me to check something?

03:53.826 --> 03:54.869
I don't know, no.

03:55.761 --> 03:56.656
Oh, wait a second.

04:04.634 --> 04:05.234
Morning.

04:05.486 --> 04:07.690
Morning. I'm not sure if you're even open yet,

04:07.741 --> 04:10.926
but, uh, I was just hoping to get a cup of coffee

04:10.977 --> 04:13.272
while they put in a new headlight for me across the street.

04:13.323 --> 04:14.433
Yeah, right this way.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.577
Stop it.

04:57.468 --> 04:58.356
Thank you.

05:15.428 --> 05:16.566
James?

05:23.951 --> 05:24.915
James!

05:31.547 --> 05:32.414
Nadine.

05:34.079 --> 05:35.062
What are you doing?

05:37.636 --> 05:38.954
Did you call the broker?

05:40.492 --> 05:42.402
No, I did not call the broker.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.241
It just did it again in the bathroom.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.222
Nadine.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.474
There's no water and the lights flickered on and off.

05:53.904 --> 05:55.222
It is an old house.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.057
There's water now.

06:07.034 --> 06:07.985
There's water.

06:12.523 --> 06:13.890
I  want to move.

06:15.831 --> 06:17.536
Nadine, please.

06:19.058 --> 06:20.916
I can't live like this, James.

06:22.608 --> 06:23.764
I just...

06:25.396 --> 06:26.334
I can't.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.435
I think I need to tell someone.

06:41.079 --> 06:42.563
Tell someone what exactly?

06:46.019 --> 06:47.164
Tell someone what?

06:54.120 --> 06:56.592
Tell someone what?

07:00.591 --> 07:02.394
Tell someone what?!

07:02.445 --> 07:03.191
What?!

07:03.583 --> 07:04.848
Here you go.

07:07.139 --> 07:08.538
Oh, thank you.

07:27.072 --> 07:27.867
Pardon me.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.740
I don't mean to trouble you,

07:29.791 --> 07:32.508
but would you mind if I stole some of your artificial sweetener?

07:33.350 --> 07:34.309
Excuse me?

07:35.008 --> 07:35.850
Sweetener.

07:35.901 --> 07:37.634
I don't have any at my table.

07:41.613 --> 07:42.543
Thank you.

07:42.594 --> 07:43.530
Sure.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.393
Was there something else?

07:52.376 --> 07:53.613
Are you all right?

07:56.521 --> 07:58.365
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.

07:58.416 --> 07:59.419
It's just...

08:02.939 --> 08:03.615
You know what?

08:06.188 --> 08:07.707
In case you change your mind.

08:11.809 --> 08:13.348
The District Attorney's office?

08:15.465 --> 08:17.711
Crying in public against the law?

08:18.314 --> 08:20.767
No, no, of course not.

08:22.278 --> 08:23.308
I'm sorry.

08:23.801 --> 08:24.881
You're trying to be nice,

08:24.932 --> 08:26.356
and  I'm not playing along.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.826
Let me pay for your coffee.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.413
No, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

08:31.546 --> 08:32.889
But I'd like to.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.577
Well, it's my birthday in a couple of days.

08:36.570 --> 08:39.751
I'd like to do something nice for somebody.

08:43.316 --> 08:44.560
Enjoy your coffee.

08:47.043 --> 08:49.372
Try not to trip on the sugar when you sit back down.

08:51.693 --> 08:54.944
All I'm saying is I should have gotten her name, that's all.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.321
It was stupid of me.

08:57.506 --> 08:59.209
What would you have done if you had gotten her name?

08:59.569 --> 09:00.622
I don't know.

09:00.723 --> 09:02.293
Run it through the computer at work.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.041
See if there was ever a police report,

09:04.092 --> 09:06.411
see if she ever filed a restraining order.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.539
Did you get tofu?

09:08.116 --> 09:08.952
I got it.

09:09.396 --> 09:10.201
Tofu?

09:11.010 --> 09:12.513
Celeste likes it on her pizza.

09:13.006 --> 09:13.721
Yum.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.152
Who's this Celeste?

09:15.203 --> 09:17.765
I don't remember you ever having mentioned her before.

09:17.819 --> 09:19.159
She's a new girl at school.

09:19.212 --> 09:20.631
Her family just moved here from New York.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.104
I really like her.

09:22.313 --> 09:25.509
She's traveled everywhere and knows everything about everything.

09:31.102 --> 09:31.896
Hello?

09:31.989 --> 09:34.125
Allison, it's Lee Scanlon.
Did I wake you?

09:34.456 --> 09:35.355
It's okay.

09:35.969 --> 09:37.651
Do you know somebody named Nadine Massey?

09:38.529 --> 09:39.791
Nadine Massey.

09:40.031 --> 09:41.795
No, never heard of her.

09:42.833 --> 09:43.651
She's not a friend of yours,

09:43.702 --> 09:44.892
someone you met through work, maybe?

09:45.424 --> 09:46.444
I don't think so.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.130
Any idea why she might have your business card?

09:51.231 --> 09:53.961
Wait, yeah, I might have met her yesterday.

09:54.012 --> 09:55.344
What's going on? Is she okay?

09:56.626 --> 09:58.607
"Okay" is not an adjective I'd use, no.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.315
So their names are Hannah,

10:07.366 --> 10:08.884
Celeste and Ashley.

10:09.457 --> 10:10.509
No, I know Hannah.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.396
They're not due here till 3:00, and I will absolutely be back before then,

10:14.447 --> 10:15.274
so don't worry.

10:15.325 --> 10:16.579
I believe you.

10:17.305 --> 10:18.492
I need to know if it's her.

10:19.591 --> 10:20.465
No, I know.

10:21.132 --> 10:22.468
Like I was supposed to meet her,

10:22.519 --> 10:24.463
like I was supposed to help her,
and I didn't.

10:24.970 --> 10:26.172
Al, give yourself a break.

10:26.223 --> 10:28.378
You only met this woman for five minutes.

10:29.101 --> 10:30.060
I know.

10:32.034 --> 10:34.644
Husband says he fell asleep on the sofa watching television.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.241
When he woke up around 3:00 and went to the bedroom,

10:37.292 --> 10:38.936
he found his wife dead on the floor.

10:38.987 --> 10:40.431
Gunshot wound to the right temple.

10:40.645 --> 10:42.107
He didn't hear the gunshot?

10:42.506 --> 10:43.445
That's what he says.

10:43.943 --> 10:46.404
Terrace doors were open, but there's no sign of an intruder.

10:47.719 --> 10:49.102
The gun was on the floor next to her.

10:49.153 --> 10:51.280
Husband says that he kept it in the bedroom safe.

10:51.787 --> 10:53.674
Guy says he loved his wife like the dickens.

10:54.091 --> 10:55.962
That she was admittedly the high-strung type,

10:56.013 --> 10:56.943
prone to hysteria.

10:57.537 --> 11:00.481
He seems devastated but not all that surprised she decided to end it all.

11:01.539 --> 11:03.001
You don't seem so convinced.

11:03.294 --> 11:04.044
I don't know.

11:05.686 --> 11:08.022
I guess I'm a little surprised she'd choose to use a gun when there's

11:08.073 --> 11:10.382
enough tranquilizers in the house to take down Shamu.

11:12.928 --> 11:14.480
Want to hear something really strange?

11:17.109 --> 11:18.465
The last few days,

11:19.239 --> 11:20.772
she actually seemed happy.

11:22.755 --> 11:23.589
Happy?

11:24.304 --> 11:25.088
Well...

11:26.203 --> 11:27.731
I mean, happier than she'd been...

11:29.012 --> 11:30.000
in  a long time.

11:33.885 --> 11:35.932
At least it seemed that way to me.
I don't know.

11:38.847 --> 11:40.200
Maybe it was actually relief.

11:42.908 --> 11:44.025
Making the decision...

11:45.772 --> 11:46.374
knowing...

11:47.942 --> 11:49.414
that it'll all be over soon.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.242
I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us.

12:10.975 --> 12:13.669
May have to speak with you again in the next few days.

12:14.121 --> 12:15.316
By  all means, Detective.

12:17.574 --> 12:19.174
Daddy, what beats two pairs?

12:19.326 --> 12:20.399
Uh, three of a kind.

12:20.450 --> 12:21.537
Hey, hey, you.

12:23.523 --> 12:24.582
Who wants popcorn?

12:24.870 --> 12:26.601
Oh, I do,
I do, I do!

12:27.203 --> 12:28.352
- Want popcorn?
- Yeah.

12:28.771 --> 12:29.764
Thank you very much.

12:30.075 --> 12:31.827
Daddy, what beats three of a kind?

12:31.878 --> 12:33.231
A full house.

12:33.517 --> 12:34.546
I see your melon.

12:34.597 --> 12:35.987
I'll raise you a cherry.

12:36.287 --> 12:38.313
Wait, you've got a full house?

12:38.717 --> 12:39.624
I quit.

12:39.851 --> 12:42.044
Fold, Celeste.
You mean you fold.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.483
Yeah, I fold, too.

12:43.788 --> 12:45.908
Okay, uh, anybody else need anything?

12:45.961 --> 12:46.782
Everybody okay?

12:46.833 --> 12:48.188
No, we're okay.

12:48.239 --> 12:48.839
All right.

12:48.813 --> 12:51.911
So we're heading back to the bedroom for a hot game of Hungry Hungry Hippos.

12:52.085 --> 12:53.678
Hungry Hungry Hippos!

12:53.867 --> 12:55.972
Um, holler if you need me to float you a loan.

12:56.023 --> 12:56.932
Yes, Daddy.

12:57.217 --> 12:58.366
Thanks,
Mr. Dubois.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.845
This is no fun.
You always win.

13:03.081 --> 13:04.605
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

13:05.093 --> 13:06.031
She's just lucky.

13:06.140 --> 13:06.848
That's all.

13:07.428 --> 13:11.165
Well, I want to do something else, something fun.

13:11.780 --> 13:14.222
You don't have a swimming pool or an X-box or anything.

13:14.273 --> 13:15.638
Your house is no fun.

13:16.644 --> 13:18.286
Well, I'm sorry.

13:18.519 --> 13:20.645
It's okay. You can't help that you're boring.

13:23.282 --> 13:25.465
Well, how about we play...

13:25.916 --> 13:27.160
Tomorrows?

13:28.455 --> 13:29.681
Tomorrows?

13:30.639 --> 13:31.342
Oh, God,

13:31.554 --> 13:33.109
she's really good at this.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.479
Three of diamonds.

13:37.458 --> 13:38.641
That's a good card.

13:39.293 --> 13:40.417
A lucky card.

13:41.538 --> 13:43.615
There's a boy you like.

13:45.684 --> 13:46.727
Robert...

13:47.516 --> 13:48.583
Bobby...

13:48.634 --> 13:49.815
Bobby Soames?

13:51.024 --> 13:52.221
He'll call you tomorrow.

13:52.688 --> 13:53.728
Who's Bobby Soames?

13:54.275 --> 13:55.799
He's a friend of my brother's.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.142
He doesn't even go to our school.

13:58.363 --> 13:59.304
How did you know?

13:59.688 --> 14:00.315
I told you,

14:00.366 --> 14:01.459
she's really good at this.

14:01.753 --> 14:02.516
Do me. Do me.

14:02.567 --> 14:03.195
Okay.

14:06.051 --> 14:07.204
Five of spades.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.365
Not so lucky.

14:10.452 --> 14:11.110
W hat?

14:13.316 --> 14:15.175
Something's going to happento your left ankle.

14:17.518 --> 14:19.117
What are you talking about?

14:20.056 --> 14:21.024
Maybe I'm wrong.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.517
I don't know.

14:22.726 --> 14:24.300
You knew about Bobby Soames.

14:25.141 --> 14:26.448
I'd stay off that ankle.

14:28.628 --> 14:29.680
Okay, my turn.

14:30.401 --> 14:31.167
Wait a second.

14:31.769 --> 14:32.767
I'm the new friend.

14:33.196 --> 14:35.194
I'm the guest. Do me again.

14:41.660 --> 14:42.507
The queen of hearts.

14:42.816 --> 14:43.599
I like that one.

14:46.535 --> 14:47.438
What's the matter?

14:48.774 --> 14:50.074
Tell me what it means.

14:54.107 --> 14:55.384
You're not going to tell me?

14:57.370 --> 14:59.430
It doesn't mean anything.

15:00.822 --> 15:06.740
Um, it just basically says that I can only give one fortune at a time.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.462
And that's it?

15:08.891 --> 15:10.583
What is that, like,
a rule or something?

15:10.650 --> 15:11.598
That's no fun.

15:13.115 --> 15:15.877
I don't want to play this anymore. This is stupid.

15:16.846 --> 15:18.381
But what about my tomorrow?

15:18.775 --> 15:20.147
Girls, I'm home!

15:20.229 --> 15:23.189
That's my mom. She said she'd bring home
some pizza and some movies.

15:33.281 --> 15:34.022
Hi.

15:36.407 --> 15:37.862
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?

15:39.597 --> 15:40.276
No.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.144
I just can't sleep.

15:44.848 --> 15:45.818
Excited, huh?

15:46.919 --> 15:47.736
I guess.

15:50.056 --> 15:51.317
Everybody having a good time?

15:52.852 --> 15:53.490
Yeah.

15:55.057 --> 15:56.363
I don't know.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.710
Honey, you're not sorry you had everybody over, are you?

16:03.553 --> 16:04.272
No.

16:04.802 --> 16:07.309
Honey, I'm sure it's going a lot better than you think.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.554
I'm just sorry I wasn't here when everyone got here.

16:12.576 --> 16:14.988
That's okay. You had to work.

16:26.972 --> 16:28.190
12 is hard.

16:29.552 --> 16:30.869
38 is harder.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.197
That's why it's important to practice when you're 12.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.252
What's going on?

16:36.884 --> 16:38.387
Ariel is upset about something.

16:39.823 --> 16:40.729
Anything serious?

16:41.124 --> 16:42.890
Everything's serious when you're 12.

16:44.355 --> 16:46.852
I just felt badly I wasn't home earlier this afternoon.

16:47.781 --> 16:49.230
By the time I left that lady's house,

16:49.348 --> 16:50.247
rented the videos,

16:50.298 --> 16:52.418
went to the pizza place and waited for one

16:52.563 --> 16:54.818
gluten-free crust, please,

16:55.432 --> 16:56.436
headed home,

16:57.039 --> 16:58.225
it was already dark.

16:58.394 --> 17:00.486
And suddenly there's the hospital, so I panic.

17:00.745 --> 17:02.984
I turn around, and I take all the back roads home.

17:03.811 --> 17:04.921
Did you hit anyone?

17:05.897 --> 17:06.907
Not that I noticed.

17:07.505 --> 17:09.709
Then stop beating yourself up.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.607
I was here, and I did a magnificent job.

17:14.300 --> 17:18.173
You refuse to have a serious conversation with me.

17:18.347 --> 17:20.398
Shoot me; I'm in a good mood.

17:20.856 --> 17:22.231
Oh, that must be nice.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.596
Sorry, but I refuse to contribute to the celebration

17:26.646 --> 17:28.690
of everything that is wrong with Allison Dubois.

17:29.223 --> 17:30.668
Yes, our 12-year-old,

17:30.719 --> 17:34.202
after being allowed to stay up way past her bedtime with her three friends,

17:34.560 --> 17:38.551
and after eating enough food to choke a horse and drinking stuff which in

17:38.602 --> 17:41.443
other countries is probably used to take the paint off of airplanes,

17:41.738 --> 17:43.724
probably isn't feeling 100%,

17:43.838 --> 17:45.311
and I'm sure that that's your fault.

17:45.379 --> 17:46.458
That's not what I'm talking about.

17:46.509 --> 17:48.607
And some woman that you met completely by chance yesterday,

17:48.784 --> 17:50.884
and whose name you didn't even know until this morning,

17:50.935 --> 17:53.498
who was bound and determined to take her own life,

17:53.940 --> 17:54.883
took her own life,

17:54.934 --> 17:56.814
and I'm sure that that was your fault, too.

17:57.065 --> 17:59.656
Look, I know you're trying to cheer me up.

17:59.707 --> 18:00.736
And my personal favorite:

18:00.853 --> 18:02.623
a  girl that you hit with your car in a dream--

18:02.674 --> 18:03.558
which, by the way,

18:03.609 --> 18:04.972
means you didn't really hit her--

18:05.090 --> 18:08.243
why don't you get a head start on that and get upset about that now rather

18:08.294 --> 18:10.527
than wait and see if and when it actually does happen?

18:10.578 --> 18:11.226
Are you through?

18:11.277 --> 18:12.641
No, I'm making a point.

18:16.142 --> 18:17.390
Yes, I'm in a good mood.

18:17.810 --> 18:19.944
Every loudmouthed girl in this house--

18:20.121 --> 18:21.381
half of them are ours--

18:21.778 --> 18:23.017
are finally asleep.

18:23.566 --> 18:24.384
Tomorrow is Sunday,

18:24.435 --> 18:26.318
which means that I don't have to go to work.

18:26.783 --> 18:28.149
And lastly...

18:28.859 --> 18:30.235
I don't know if you've noticed,

18:30.286 --> 18:33.626
but this whole damn place smells like s'mores.

18:34.505 --> 18:36.475
So, sorry, baby, I refuse to be depressed,

18:36.768 --> 18:40.859
and that means I refuse to let you be depressed, either.

18:43.054 --> 18:45.604
Wow, that's the same speech I just gave Ariel.

18:45.951 --> 18:46.675
See?

18:47.314 --> 18:49.381
Mediocre minds think alike.

19:00.162 --> 19:01.795
I think I need to tell someone.

19:08.705 --> 19:10.029
Tell someone what exactly?

19:13.638 --> 19:14.714
Tell someone what?

19:21.676 --> 19:24.166
Tell someone what?!

19:28.297 --> 19:30.099
Tell someone what?!

19:30.150 --> 19:30.750
What?!

19:33.812 --> 19:34.708
Never mind.

20:11.010 --> 20:11.915
James?

20:13.194 --> 20:13.969
James?!

20:20.432 --> 20:21.158
Please stop.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.223
Thank you.

20:31.921 --> 20:35.169
<i>Did you ever see a dream walking?</i>

20:35.857 --> 20:37.027
<i>Well, I did</i>

20:39.476 --> 20:42.163
<i>Did you ever hear a dream talking?</i>

20:42.846 --> 20:45.222
<i>Well, I did.</i>

20:45.940 --> 20:49.594
<i>Did you ever have a dream thrill you?</i>

20:50.162 --> 20:53.646
<i>With "Will you be mine?"</i>

21:00.646 --> 21:04.008
<i>Did you ever see a dream dancing?</i>

21:04.228 --> 21:06.029
<i>Well, I did</i>

21:07.654 --> 21:10.518
<i>Did you ever see a dream romancing?</i>

21:10.569 --> 21:11.189
James?

21:11.240 --> 21:12.128
<i>Well, I did</i>

21:12.179 --> 21:14.837
James! Make it stop!

21:17.052 --> 21:19.297
James! James!

21:23.572 --> 21:24.468
Nadine!

21:42.759 --> 21:43.808
Hey, you.

21:44.986 --> 21:45.680
Hey.

21:46.165 --> 21:47.300
Did you have a good class?

21:48.038 --> 21:49.988
Yeah. Can we just go, please?

21:50.700 --> 21:51.987
Okay, did you say good-bye to...

21:52.038 --> 21:54.403
Yes. Can we please just go?

21:57.893 --> 22:01.452
So, anybody in school say anything about your party?

22:01.718 --> 22:02.400
I don't know.

22:02.590 --> 22:03.242
I guess.

22:04.008 --> 22:04.735
Did they have fun?

22:04.786 --> 22:05.838
Did the girls have a good time?

22:06.345 --> 22:07.181
Yes, Mom.

22:07.283 --> 22:08.272
Everyone had fun.

22:08.323 --> 22:11.071
Now can we please not discuss it?

22:12.057 --> 22:13.049
Okay.

22:20.349 --> 22:21.473
At the slumber party,

22:23.044 --> 22:24.276
just for fun,

22:25.920 --> 22:27.900
I kind of started telling everyone their future.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.076
Okay.

22:30.805 --> 22:31.541
It was easy.

22:31.592 --> 22:34.596
I just thought things in my head and I...

22:35.171 --> 22:36.584
I said them out loud.

22:36.823 --> 22:40.166
And I knew the stuff I thought would make them like me.

22:41.863 --> 22:45.242
I knew Celeste would want to know that the boy she likes would call her.

22:46.765 --> 22:50.311
And then I started thinking that Ashley would sprain her ankle.

22:51.189 --> 22:52.142
Did you say anything?

22:54.699 --> 22:56.250
But then I thought something worse.

22:56.921 --> 22:57.640
About Ashley?

22:58.532 --> 22:59.671
About Celeste.

23:00.752 --> 23:01.536
She was older,

23:01.612 --> 23:02.695
like in high school,

23:03.091 --> 23:05.124
and she was in the hospital,

23:06.129 --> 23:08.491
and she was really, really sick.

23:10.314 --> 23:14.775
She had tubes going into her and she couldn't breathe,

23:14.826 --> 23:18.846
and there was a minister standing there... waiting.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.434
And it just made me so sad.

23:24.705 --> 23:25.893
Then I go to dance class,

23:26.362 --> 23:28.169
and Ashley sprains her ankle.

23:29.452 --> 23:33.180
And... Celeste told me about Bobby calling.

23:35.947 --> 23:40.618
Do you think this means that Celeste will get sick?

23:42.098 --> 23:43.487
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

23:43.538 --> 23:44.773
I told her not to tell anybody.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.465
I said a lot of times that I'm wrong.

23:47.102 --> 23:48.483
There's nothing to do but wait,

23:48.838 --> 23:50.924
and she can always talk to me and I'd wait with her.

23:51.104 --> 23:51.780
That's it?

23:52.624 --> 23:53.355
Yeah.

23:53.918 --> 23:54.911
I was pretty proud of myself.

23:54.962 --> 23:56.390
I thought that was a pretty good answer.

23:56.785 --> 23:57.816
I'm not so sure it is.

23:58.774 --> 24:01.646
I'm not so sure that we don't owe this girl's parents a call.

24:01.848 --> 24:02.968
And say what?

24:03.398 --> 24:04.306
I don't know.

24:04.716 --> 24:06.070
"Take your kid to a doctor.

24:06.121 --> 24:07.174
Have her tested."

24:07.878 --> 24:11.753
We don't know that whatever she's suffering from
in this vision isn't preventable.

24:11.804 --> 24:12.916
We don't know anything.

24:12.967 --> 24:14.258
This is Ariel we're talking about.

24:14.525 --> 24:16.445
Yeah, but she got the other two predictions right, didn't she?

24:16.702 --> 24:19.061
Excuse me? You want to call
this girl's parents and say, "Hi.

24:19.112 --> 24:21.738
"My daughter Ariel Dubois had a vision that your daughter was

24:21.862 --> 24:23.289
fighting for her life in the hospital"?

24:23.436 --> 24:24.135
I don't know.

24:24.186 --> 24:25.353
Don't we have an obligation?

24:25.404 --> 24:28.790
We have an obligation to our daughter not to do or say anything that makes

24:28.841 --> 24:31.712
life as a 12-year-old girl any harder than it already is.

24:32.502 --> 24:34.963
And you calling this girl's parents and saying she has visions,

24:35.014 --> 24:37.810
I don't see how that's going to make life in the sixth grade any easier.

24:41.344 --> 24:42.081
Oh, man.

24:46.009 --> 24:46.856
Oh!

24:47.564 --> 24:49.301
Did I hear someone say Chinese?

24:50.311 --> 24:51.954
It's a beautiful night in Phoenix.

24:52.269 --> 24:54.560
The temperature is around 78 degrees,
not a cloud in sight.

24:54.769 --> 24:56.154
For those of you that love good music,

24:56.205 --> 24:58.832
here's another pretty song coming at you.

25:05.192 --> 25:06.924
<i>What day is it?</i>

25:09.927 --> 25:14.003
<i>...this clock now seems so alive</i>

25:15.342 --> 25:19.619
<i>I can't give up 'Cause I can...</i>

25:21.689 --> 25:22.490
Damn.

25:28.649 --> 25:37.828
<i>And you and me And all of the people With nothing to do, Nothing to lose</i>

25:37.879 --> 25:45.072
<i>And it's you and me, And our love of people And I don't know why...</i>

25:45.123 --> 25:46.793
Toby, stop!

25:46.844 --> 25:49.799
<i>I can't keep my eyes off of you...</i>

26:06.393 --> 26:08.388
Oh, honey, I need to watch the road.

26:14.301 --> 26:19.931
Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthday to you.

26:20.456 --> 26:22.051
Oh, hey, come on, baby.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.310
Let's wait till we get home, all right?
I've got a surprise for you.

26:24.361 --> 26:25.736
I don't want to wait.

26:25.787 --> 26:27.343
I want to celebrate.

26:27.591 --> 26:29.367
Oh, I made a rhyme.

26:35.453 --> 26:36.935
Toby! Stop!

26:46.143 --> 26:47.073
Oh, my God.

26:47.447 --> 26:49.155
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

26:55.444 --> 26:56.510
What are you doing?

26:56.961 --> 26:58.927
What are you doing?!
Stop the car.

26:59.893 --> 27:01.452
I had two martinis and an Irish coffee.

27:01.503 --> 27:02.685
What about you, Nadine?

27:03.493 --> 27:04.300
What?

27:05.561 --> 27:07.748
Do you want me to go to prison, Nadine?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.941
Do you want me to get locked up?

27:10.567 --> 27:16.756
Because we got smashed on your birthday
and some girl ran right in front of our car?

27:16.807 --> 27:20.717
<i>Our love of people And I don't know why...</i>

27:20.846 --> 27:21.748
We have to call somebody.

27:21.799 --> 27:23.136
We have to, we have to tell someone.

27:23.755 --> 27:24.627
She'll get help.

27:26.292 --> 27:27.365
She's gonna be fine.

27:28.841 --> 27:29.713
So will we.

27:29.764 --> 27:31.477
<i>Nothing to do...</i>

27:36.396 --> 27:38.368
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

27:40.512 --> 27:41.735
Yeah, I remember this case.

27:41.931 --> 27:43.310
Melanie Davenport.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.327
Hit-and-run.

27:45.378 --> 27:46.224
You turn up something?

27:46.400 --> 27:48.207
I think the driver was James Massie.

27:48.262 --> 27:49.539
Nadine Massie's husband.

27:49.662 --> 27:51.171
I think she was in the car when it happened,

27:51.804 --> 27:54.660
and I think the guilt over what they did drove her to kill herself.

27:55.353 --> 27:56.309
I mean no disrespect,

27:56.381 --> 27:58.805
but does this theory come with any actual evidence?

27:59.155 --> 28:02.728
The only eyewitness to the accident was two blocks away and saw a dark four-

28:02.779 --> 28:04.427
door hit Melanie and then speed off.

28:04.609 --> 28:05.843
According to DMV records,

28:05.894 --> 28:08.823
in 2004, the Massies were driving a green ES.

28:09.654 --> 28:13.600
The paint found on Melanie's clothing
matches the paint they used on the ES that year.

28:13.671 --> 28:14.985
But not just the ES.

28:15.317 --> 28:16.652
Not just the ES, no.

28:16.851 --> 28:18.243
Well, that's very thin, Lee.

28:18.384 --> 28:19.507
And do we know where the car is now?

28:19.863 --> 28:21.900
Well, according to the DMV,
it was reported stolen.

28:22.955 --> 28:24.778
Don't tell me it happened the day after the accident?

28:25.389 --> 28:26.170
Two, actually.

28:27.524 --> 28:31.379
Report says it disappeared from a mall parking lot
while Nadine Massie was Christmas shopping.

28:31.805 --> 28:32.454
My hunch?

28:32.681 --> 28:35.156
They drove it to a border town,
left it at the curb with the keys in it.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.987
It was probably in 10,000 pieces
in some Mexican chop shop by nightfall.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.482
Well, all this is fascinating,

28:42.255 --> 28:45.210
but it really falls under the heading of coincidence and speculation.

28:45.261 --> 28:47.719
I can't even bring in the guy for questioning based on this.

28:48.019 --> 28:48.627
Really?

28:48.841 --> 28:50.628
'Cause I already called and asked him to come down.

28:50.745 --> 28:52.298
He's sitting in your conference room right now.

28:53.408 --> 28:56.696
What, to discuss his possible involvement in a year-old hit-and-run case?

28:58.021 --> 28:59.566
Yeah, I may have left that part out.

29:01.365 --> 29:07.501
You... um... you call friends,

29:09.236 --> 29:10.139
relatives,

29:11.831 --> 29:13.145
first you have to tell them,

29:15.010 --> 29:15.718
you know, that...

29:16.498 --> 29:17.603
that she's gone,

29:19.864 --> 29:22.526
and then, you have to...

29:22.693 --> 29:23.768
find a way to, um...

29:27.853 --> 29:28.830
you know, get to...

29:31.691 --> 29:32.626
how she left.

29:35.466 --> 29:36.595
We appreciate you coming down,

29:36.646 --> 29:37.399
Mr. Massie.

29:38.789 --> 29:43.592
We know how difficult this is for you and we want to bring this to as

29:43.643 --> 29:44.874
speedy a resolve as possible.

29:45.983 --> 29:46.909
Unfortunately,

29:47.795 --> 29:52.304
there was a firearm registered in your name that was involved with your

29:52.355 --> 29:53.741
late wife's death.

29:53.881 --> 29:55.802
I understand.

29:56.251 --> 29:57.313
You can ask me anything.

29:58.681 --> 29:59.529
I'm sorry.

29:59.861 --> 30:00.672
Bit of a cold.

30:00.950 --> 30:01.859
That's fine.

30:03.254 --> 30:06.877
I know that both the detective and Mrs. Dubois have asked you this,

30:07.852 --> 30:12.470
but do you think there was something specific that precipitated your late

30:12.521 --> 30:14.534
wife's desire to take her own life?

30:19.460 --> 30:20.688
I've racked my brain.

30:20.739 --> 30:21.590
I, um...

30:24.177 --> 30:25.402
Her birthday was coming up.

30:26.568 --> 30:29.943
But she was always pretty excited about that.

30:31.424 --> 30:33.989
You ever own a green 2004 ES, Mr. Massie?

30:37.366 --> 30:38.100
I did.

30:39.930 --> 30:40.742
Um, it was stolen.

30:41.450 --> 30:44.107
We have witnesses that possibly put it at the scene of a hit-and-run.

30:46.815 --> 30:52.525
Okay. Um... well, I mean it was stolen...

30:54.118 --> 30:54.935
a while ago.

30:55.495 --> 30:59.254
I think, uh, it's been almost a year now.

30:59.954 --> 31:00.774
We understand that,

31:00.825 --> 31:03.815
but this, this hit-and-run I'm referring to

31:03.866 --> 31:05.862
actually occurred a couple of days before that.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.307
Your wife's birthday, actually.

31:11.111 --> 31:12.204
15-year-old girl,

31:12.325 --> 31:13.733
Melanie Davenport, was killed.

31:14.346 --> 31:16.046
She was running after her dog.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.051
The person who hit her just kept going.

31:19.928 --> 31:21.618
Didn't even call 911.

31:30.059 --> 31:30.736
Okay.

31:34.082 --> 31:37.815
So... the reason I'm here,

31:39.686 --> 31:40.351
I mean...

31:41.771 --> 31:43.104
what you're trying to tell me...

31:45.898 --> 31:52.384
You think that maybe my wife hit this girl in our car and never reported it?

31:56.697 --> 31:57.297
Well...

31:57.246 --> 31:59.443
Because... I mean,

31:59.872 --> 32:00.767
if that were true,

32:02.579 --> 32:06.143
it would certainly explain a lot of things.

32:07.734 --> 32:08.655
What things?

32:11.202 --> 32:12.829
Well, uh...

32:14.581 --> 32:18.181
Nadine's state of mind over this entire past year,

32:18.232 --> 32:18.897
for one.

32:21.196 --> 32:22.580
If this were true, and mind you,

32:22.631 --> 32:25.265
I'm not saying that this is,

32:25.316 --> 32:30.629
but... I can't even imagine what kind of...

32:32.263 --> 32:34.521
terrible guilt she must have been living with.

32:39.478 --> 32:41.457
I mean, it's no wonder she was so unstrung.

32:49.424 --> 32:50.760
Everyone's in bed.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.915
I lied and told them you'd sneak in later
while they were asleep and give them kisses.

32:55.845 --> 32:57.792
It's not necessarily a lie.

32:58.189 --> 32:59.411
How do you know it's a lie?

32:59.845 --> 33:01.070
I'm a student of history.

33:01.902 --> 33:04.323
And history suggests that when you get in one of these moods,

33:05.812 --> 33:08.910
the kind where you end up laying here on the couch stewing in your

33:08.961 --> 33:11.390
inability to effect any real change,

33:12.600 --> 33:16.129
eventually you fall asleep and no one sees you till morning.

33:17.542 --> 33:18.535
It's not going to happen.

33:19.148 --> 33:22.646
I just need a little time for myself, okay?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.146
I had a very depressing day.

33:28.488 --> 33:29.217
Well, I wouldn't know.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.979
You haven't said three words to me since I got home.

33:32.259 --> 33:34.012
Here are the highlights:
James Massie--

33:34.134 --> 33:36.749
he completely sold out his poor dead wife today.

33:37.619 --> 33:39.283
He could have said he didn't know anything.

33:39.908 --> 33:41.502
He knows we can't prove he was there.

33:42.144 --> 33:44.143
But no, he had to go that extra step

33:44.816 --> 33:47.835
and offer up Nadine who is not in a position to defend herself.

33:49.971 --> 33:52.751
I'm sorry. I just have to get that out of my system.

33:53.358 --> 33:55.157
Well, I have something I have to get out of my system.

33:56.041 --> 34:00.147
I asked Ariel for Celeste's parents' names and phone number today.

34:01.644 --> 34:02.622
I'm a scientist.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.325
People don't fall suddenly ill.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.428
It happens gradually over time.

34:07.099 --> 34:09.594
And there are windows of opportunity in which to intervene.

34:11.219 --> 34:15.418
I think it's worth the risk and any possible hardship to say something.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.473
And I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't.

34:20.780 --> 34:21.722
I know.

34:26.799 --> 34:27.945
I'll see you in the morning.

34:29.489 --> 34:30.480
Don't worry.

34:30.531 --> 34:32.172
I'm not going to fall asleep out here.

34:32.405 --> 34:33.134
Ha.

34:33.802 --> 34:34.402
Ha.

34:35.864 --> 34:36.464
Ha.

34:41.501 --> 34:43.489
<i>Did you ever see a dream romancing</i>

34:43.540 --> 34:46.280
<i>Well I did</i>

34:46.857 --> 34:50.719
<i>Did you ever see heaven right in your arms</i>

34:50.926 --> 34:52.076
James! James!

34:55.869 --> 34:56.904
Nadine!

34:59.799 --> 35:00.907
Oh, God.

35:01.407 --> 35:02.160
Baby.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.014
What did you do?

35:05.190 --> 35:05.839
Oh...

35:09.340 --> 35:10.325
Don't worry, honey.

35:10.799 --> 35:12.809
I'm going to get you some help, okay?

35:15.875 --> 35:16.622
James.

35:17.343 --> 35:17.943
James.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.493
We have to tell.

35:21.899 --> 35:23.120
I can't go on.

35:24.370 --> 35:25.717
I can't live this way.

35:28.252 --> 35:29.824
What are you talking about?
Tell who?

35:30.593 --> 35:31.826
The police.

35:33.327 --> 35:35.347
She'll never leave until we do.

35:46.397 --> 35:49.359
<i>Did you ever see a dream walking?</i>

35:49.622 --> 35:55.762
<i>Well I did.
Did you ever hear a dream talking?</i>

35:56.210 --> 36:00.881
<i>Well I did.
Did you ever have a dream...</i>

36:08.855 --> 36:09.896
Did you call them?

36:10.761 --> 36:11.431
Are they coming?

36:11.482 --> 36:12.142
They're coming.

36:12.983 --> 36:13.957
You're going to be fine.

36:17.294 --> 36:18.258
This was stupid,

36:18.329 --> 36:19.548
what I did.

36:21.659 --> 36:22.919
I don't want to die.

36:23.074 --> 36:23.859
I know.

36:24.234 --> 36:25.566
I just wanted it to stop.

36:25.979 --> 36:26.886
Shh.

36:31.548 --> 36:32.364
Will you stay with me?

36:33.553 --> 36:37.546
I will. I'll stay with you till they get here.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.823
Close your eyes, baby.

36:42.309 --> 36:43.128
It's all right.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.782
It's going to be just a few minutes.

36:52.591 --> 36:53.490
Shh.

37:01.977 --> 37:02.872
Allison?

37:03.417 --> 37:04.017
It's okay.

37:04.006 --> 37:04.977
It's just me.

37:05.109 --> 37:05.893
I need to get my wallet.

37:05.944 --> 37:06.964
I have to go for a drive.

37:07.518 --> 37:08.284
A drive?

37:09.559 --> 37:10.316
It's 2:00 in the morning.

37:10.367 --> 37:11.715
Where in the world are you going to drive to?

37:11.911 --> 37:12.823
I need to go to that street,

37:12.874 --> 37:13.859
the one near the hospital.

37:13.910 --> 37:15.036
This isn't over, not yet.

37:15.087 --> 37:16.382
I just had another dream.

37:17.007 --> 37:18.852
Well, fine, then get back in bed, dream some more.

37:18.903 --> 37:19.659
No, I can't.

37:19.888 --> 37:20.569
That dead girl,

37:20.634 --> 37:21.537
Melanie Davenport,

37:21.658 --> 37:23.214
I think she's trying to tell me something.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.718
You're not going to find her here.

37:46.591 --> 37:49.032
Melanie's fine. She's safe.

37:50.081 --> 37:52.855
She's where she's supposed to be finally.

37:54.109 --> 37:55.079
And how about you?

37:55.741 --> 37:56.433
Me?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.420
I'm still adjusting.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.823
Getting... used to the idea.

38:04.765 --> 38:06.412
Trying to accept what he did.

38:13.055 --> 38:16.255
You know, it took me almost 27 minutes to die.

38:18.305 --> 38:23.584
He sat beside me holding my hand for 27 minutes while I tried to hang on,

38:26.446 --> 38:28.565
listening for the sirens that never came.

38:32.549 --> 38:34.039
But I guess I had it coming.

38:36.911 --> 38:41.122
I should have come forward to the police and told them what we'd done.

38:42.312 --> 38:43.855
That's all that Melanie wanted.

38:44.995 --> 38:46.238
She never meant to hurt me.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.642
That day that you and I met in the restaurant--

38:52.117 --> 38:53.672
she arranged that you know.

38:55.452 --> 38:56.874
And the business with your headlight?

38:58.241 --> 39:01.950
She was giving me a chance to confess, a chance to live,

39:02.001 --> 39:03.117
and I didn't take it.

39:06.084 --> 39:09.617
And now Melanie's parents will never know who took their child from them.

39:12.677 --> 39:13.915
And what happens to your husband?

39:15.804 --> 39:17.278
He had a chance, too.

39:18.730 --> 39:20.203
Today, with you, in the room,

39:21.067 --> 39:22.186
he had a chance,

39:22.644 --> 39:23.811
and he didn't take it.

39:28.514 --> 39:30.023
So now, I guess it's up to me.

39:32.619 --> 39:34.620
I don't understand.
What are you going to do?

39:35.429 --> 39:37.187
Obviously,
he's not afraid of ghosts.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.756
He's not afraid of flickering lights or music.

39:42.425 --> 39:44.432
But if someone, or something,

39:46.492 --> 39:50.434
was to blow out the pilot light in the old stove in our kitchen,

39:52.403 --> 39:54.039
and James were to have a cold,

39:55.343 --> 39:56.603
not smell the gas,

39:57.967 --> 40:02.205
let it fill the room and James were to light a cigarette...

40:06.500 --> 40:08.810
I wonder what those sirens are all about?

40:14.983 --> 40:16.221
Do you smell something?

40:30.958 --> 40:32.789
Don't forget to bring home those names and that phone number.

40:33.017 --> 40:33.766
I won't, Daddy.

40:33.980 --> 40:34.580
Okay.

40:36.703 --> 40:37.704
Why isn't Mommy up?

40:38.289 --> 40:39.896
I like the way she pours better.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.755
Mommy was out late last night doing some emergency work.

40:44.027 --> 40:44.870
Darn.

40:47.370 --> 40:48.104
Hello?

40:51.051 --> 40:52.846
Yes, this is her mother.

40:54.527 --> 40:55.182
Morning.

40:59.483 --> 41:00.627
What about Celeste?

41:00.678 --> 41:02.157
Uh, I already reminded her.

41:02.450 --> 41:03.953
Well, that was her mom just now.

41:05.034 --> 41:07.781
She was wondering if you could pick up Celeste's homework today because

41:07.832 --> 41:10.517
Celeste needs to go to New York for a couple of days.

41:12.075 --> 41:13.663
Why, what's going on?

41:14.420 --> 41:15.768
I guess she has a cousin,

41:17.071 --> 41:19.911
a spitting image of Celeste,
only ten years older,

41:20.286 --> 41:22.695
and I guess she was just diagnosed with leukemia,

41:22.751 --> 41:24.647
so they're all going there to say good-bye.

41:31.291 --> 41:33.746
You know what?
I'm not hungry anymore.

41:33.797 --> 41:35.782
I'm just going to go to my room.

41:40.972 --> 41:42.809
I owe that girl a conversation.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.304
I don't get it.

41:46.355 --> 41:47.356
What's going on?

41:47.688 --> 41:49.609
Why is everybody so serious?

41:50.638 --> 41:52.028
It's hard to explain.

41:53.412 --> 41:54.971
You'll see, the older you get.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.035
I'll be right back.

42:00.471 --> 42:02.983
Well, I don't know how to tell this to you.

42:04.505 --> 42:06.858
I guess it's just you and me, kid.

42:07.150 --> 42:10.428
