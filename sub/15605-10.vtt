WEBVTT

00:09.640 --> 00:11.400
'Ex On The Beach is back.'

00:13.280 --> 00:14.800
'This time it's all-stars.'

00:14.880 --> 00:18.960
'Old faces return for another shot
at finding love.'

00:19.040 --> 00:20.880
Am I looking for love?
Fucking yes.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.080
'They'll have to endure
their exes.'

00:24.160 --> 00:26.880
I have never, ever felt like this
in my life.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.320
'Some will have to deal with
old grudges.'

00:30.720 --> 00:33.240
You've had more dicks
than I've had sunbeds.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.640
'And hard as they try to find
their perfect match...'

00:36.720 --> 00:38.760
Right! Who wants to finger me?

00:38.840 --> 00:43.240
'...standing in their way once again
will be the Tablet of Terror.'

00:43.320 --> 00:45.680
I won't lie. I'm cacking myself.
Big time.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.840
'It's going to be hotter
than ever before.'

00:48.920 --> 00:50.960
I'm gonna ride her.
Giddy up, Aimee.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.040
'As emotions boil over...'

00:53.120 --> 00:57.080
You made me realise that there's
more to life than what I was doing.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.720
'...tensions run high...'

00:58.800 --> 01:00.680
Dare ya! I fucking dare ya!

01:00.760 --> 01:02.120
Let's fucking go, kid!

01:02.200 --> 01:03.920
'...and the claws come out.'

01:04.000 --> 01:05.800
Shut your face!

01:05.880 --> 01:07.080
(shouting)

01:07.160 --> 01:10.120
'So far 11 exes have arrived.'

01:11.720 --> 01:14.680
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.800
I did not think
that I was gonna feel like this.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:38.480 --> 01:40.200
Aimee. She is gorgeous.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.120
I like to flirt with him,

01:42.200 --> 01:45.920
but he's not gonna get anywhere
just yet.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.920
I'm having a shitter.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.080
Am I gonna have any nasty surprises?

01:52.160 --> 01:55.680
Did you see her
when I was in Australia with you?

01:55.760 --> 01:58.960
I kinda slept with Chrysten
when I was with Lillie.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.520
Stop it. That's your closure now.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.720
Don't take advantage
when they trust you.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.440
Bear is hot.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.840
And we have a massive physical
attraction to each other.

02:09.919 --> 02:14.280
Lillie's great, but Chrysten
is my sexy little secret.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.520
Did you kiss him in the bathroom?
Yes.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.480
(Lillie) I don't have
the time of day for Bear.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.360
I just don't know how
I will trust anyone ever again.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.520
When my best friend lies to me,
I cut them out of my life.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.160
Mel was go fresh, obviously.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.440
Don't give a shit about Kayleigh.
I'll do what I want.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.760
She is a first class bitch.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.160
OK, Melissa,
you want to play that game?

02:42.240 --> 02:44.520
You wanna get in...
(shouting)

02:44.600 --> 02:46.200
She's a fucking slag,

02:46.280 --> 02:50.520
with a conky nose, saggy-ass tits
and she thinks she can speak to me?

02:50.600 --> 02:53.600
Who the fuck does she think she is?

02:53.680 --> 02:56.480
'With the all-stars adventure
drawing to a close,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.320
it looks like one person
is going to leave happy.'

03:00.400 --> 03:02.800
I loved waking up
next to Alex this morning.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.920
And his dick.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.600
I can't believe
I'm gonna walk out of this villa

03:06.680 --> 03:09.960
boyfriend and girlfriend.
We're at it like fucking rabbits.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.320
I'm having a great time.
Not like everyone else.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.400
They're fucking at each other's
throat constantly.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.400
I woke up this morning with Ash.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.680
He's not the one
I'll spend my life with.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.080
However, he is someone
I keep going back to

03:29.160 --> 03:30.720
and I do have feelings for.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.160
If he does fuck me over again,
it's gonna hurt me.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.400
The bitch fights between
Kayleigh and Melissa are irrelevant.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.360
The real argument is me.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.720
I'm gonna go for Mel.
She's the prize all the lads want.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.320
At the end of the day,
I'm gonna get her.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.520
If all else fails,
I've got Kayleigh to fall back on.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.560
We said nasty things yesterday that
I never thought I'd say to you.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.800
I feel like Melissa is
getting isolated from the group

04:05.880 --> 04:08.880
because of our problems
and I don't want that.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.120
Sorry for kicking off.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.760
She's made me feel shit,
insecure, left out,

04:17.839 --> 04:19.200
since I've been in here.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.560
Water under the bridge.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.440
Let's be civil.
Yeah.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.160
Kayleigh's being nice
cos I have shit on her.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.840
She can go fuck herself.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.160
I went on a date with Olivia
yesterday.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.680
I don't know where she slept.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.960
Anyone know where
she slept last night?

04:42.040 --> 04:44.120
Whose bed? I dunno.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.360
(laughter)

04:45.440 --> 04:46.840
Sorry, Bear.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.880
She weren't in your bed, was she?

04:51.120 --> 04:54.280
Me and the villa.
Honestly, it's lonely.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.520
I'm getting no attention
from no one.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.800
(narrator)
'Not for the want of trying!'

05:00.920 --> 05:01.960
Come on, girls!

05:03.760 --> 05:05.440
Should we kiss?
No.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.600
My game plan with Jess
is stick it on her straightaway.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.440
Gonna kiss you. I fancy ya.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.240
I like that Chloe.
She's pretty sassy.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.240
I fancy ya.
Great chat.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.720
I'm happy.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.200
You know I'm the hottest?
In the world.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.680
Wanna hear a secret?

05:21.760 --> 05:23.840
Go on.
I fancy you, too.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.080
Charlotte and Bear. Cher!

05:27.200 --> 05:28.640
Lillie is fit.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.480
Bear and Lillie. Billie.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.320
My eyes are swaying, guys.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.760
I want Chrysten.
I would love to fuck her brains out.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.040
It's like a love story, me and you.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.680
Now you're single, I wanna mingle.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.320
Bear and Olivia. Bolivia.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.600
I always want more.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.400
Greedy Bear. Greedy Bear.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.600
Aimee. She is gorgeous.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.760
I'm gonna build bridges with her,
kiss her.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.920
Giddy up, Aimee. Giddy up.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.760
I had a flirt with Bear
but I'm confused by the situation.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.320
'Do you know what?'

06:04.400 --> 06:07.520
It's the last day, so maybe
I'll go in for a Bear hug.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.280
I'm worried Gary's mugging me off.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.560
I had every intention
of not going back to Gary,

06:19.640 --> 06:21.920
but I just can't resist the parsnip.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.680
Last night, we went to the bathroom
and were speaking for ages.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.160
"I want to spend
the rest of my time with you."

06:28.240 --> 06:30.240
"Why would you fall for Bear?"

06:31.680 --> 06:33.000
Exactly.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.200
Olivia is being so silly
at the moment.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.240
She should know what Gaz is like
and not go back there.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.640
But if I was her, I would.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.560
It's easy to go back to
who you've slept with before.

06:42.640 --> 06:47.240
I just think he has spent every time
with you apart from this one time.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.760
Do you think I look like an idiot
going back?

06:52.040 --> 06:55.200
It might look like you're an idiot.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.080
But we all know you're not.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.800
If the main person doesn't think
you're an idiot,

07:00.880 --> 07:03.000
and that's Gaz.
Mm.

07:03.080 --> 07:07.200
(narrator) 'Gaz and his parsnip are
gonna be the last things on your mind

07:07.280 --> 07:09.720
when the next ex crops up.'

07:09.800 --> 07:12.520
'T minus four hours.'

07:15.000 --> 07:17.040
'Tablet of Terror is feeling naughty

07:17.120 --> 07:21.360
and has sent Ash on a date with
Kayleigh's ex-best buddy, Melissa.'

07:21.440 --> 07:24.160
Ready to have the best date ever?
We'll see.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.760
We walk up to the date

07:25.840 --> 07:30.200
and apparently we've got to plant
an orchid.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.600
Like, what even is an orchid?
Orchid. Orc... Whatever it is.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.680
Maybe if I do like you,

07:37.760 --> 07:41.200
then I'm gonna have to give Kayleigh
some flowers to say sorry.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.280
(chuckles) Some sympathy flowers?

07:44.360 --> 07:46.800
I'm not gonna lie,
I do feel bad for Kayleigh.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.680
But the competition for Mel
between the boys is too exciting.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.720
And I am a winner.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.840
I obviously like ya.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.680
But cos I'm not allowed to...

07:56.760 --> 07:59.080
You want it even more.
I want ya.

07:59.160 --> 08:03.120
Kayleigh destroyed our friendship
and I'm never gonna forgive that.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.360
So me kissing Ash
will be the perfect payback.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.840
You always wanted me. Come on.
A little bit.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.480
Since that first time...

08:10.560 --> 08:11.960
But I've got to think...

08:12.040 --> 08:13.720
Last time I kissed you,

08:13.800 --> 08:16.120
you went back to the villa
and mugged me off

08:16.200 --> 08:17.920
by getting with someone else.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.440
How do I know you're not gonna
do that again?

08:20.520 --> 08:22.240
Melissa's playing hard to get.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.360
I decide to turn up the charm.
We know where this will go.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.560
You're like the prize in the villa.
The forbidden fruit.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.160
And if I did kiss you
and we did get on,

08:31.240 --> 08:33.440
then I'd love to give you
a present later

08:33.520 --> 08:35.039
cos you deserve one.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.679
You should water my plant
and make it wet.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.880
It'll be nothing compared
to later on.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.360
I knew Melissa liked me, but
I didn't think it'd be this easy.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.760
Can you read that out?
"To Kayleigh."

08:45.840 --> 08:49.040
"Sorry I took your man.
He's mine now."

08:50.320 --> 08:54.440
It is so hard to resist Ash
cos, if I'm honest,

08:54.520 --> 08:56.200
he's completely my type.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.960
I like you dead dirty.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.680
Oh, you like...

08:59.760 --> 09:01.840
Oh, my God. Listen.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.800
If you're gonna play that game...

09:05.680 --> 09:07.320
Melissa thinks I'm dirty now,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.920
wait till she gets me
in the bedroom later.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.400
Sorry, Kayleigh. I've done it again.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.520
(tablet dings)

09:24.600 --> 09:26.520
(all sigh)

09:26.600 --> 09:29.560
Fuck you.
I've already got two psycho exes,

09:29.640 --> 09:31.760
don't give me a-fucking-nother one.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.520
"Afternoon, all stars and exes."

09:34.600 --> 09:36.440
"Don't get too comfortable."

09:36.520 --> 09:40.600
"It's time for Lillie, Olivia
and Kayleigh to head to the beach."

09:40.680 --> 09:43.520
No, Tablet of Terror.
Have you not done enough?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.600
Fuck my life!

09:45.680 --> 09:50.840
I am fuming. I just can't be
bothered with it being my ex.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.000
It would ruin things
with me and Gaz.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.760
Too much has happened in here.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.120
I am already having a shit day.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.080
Tablet of Terror has sent
Melissa and Ash on a date.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.160
Again, Kayleigh looks like
the stupid fucking mug.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.760
I'm so nervous.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.240
Every single night I say,
"This can't get any worse for me."

10:17.320 --> 10:18.400
And it's got worse.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.640
I think that this is gonna be
a complete spanner in the works.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.720
I don't think
it's gonna be anyone we expect.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.960
Whatever prick comes out,
it's not gonna be good.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.760
The beach surprises me every time.
I always think I have an idea

10:32.840 --> 10:35.400
and then round comes someone
out of the blue

10:35.480 --> 10:38.120
and you think,
"Where the fuck did you come from?"

10:39.120 --> 10:41.400
If it's any of your exes,
who do you think?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.480
There's James.
He's my most serious ex.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.880
I hate that boy. I hate him so much.
I can't be around him.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.440
I swear to God,
if he walks out of that sea,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.000
I will flick him back in.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.480
Remove yourself. You're not welcome.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.200
My worst would be Adam.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.120
There's other exes I've got

11:00.200 --> 11:03.960
but I don't think they affect me
as much as this date can.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.800
Point isn't that Ash
is gonna get with Mel.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.160
The point is two people
are at a test.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.200
If they fail,
that's two people out of my life.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.800
My worst would be Jude.

11:14.880 --> 11:19.560
There has only been one person
I've seen since Gary and I broke up.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.760
I don't want him
to rock up on that beach.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.200
I'm in a shit mood anyway,

11:25.280 --> 11:28.120
so if it's my ex, I'll be like,
"Fuck off!"

11:42.600 --> 11:45.200
Ash and Mel.
For me, it's a tricky one.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.400
If he kisses her,
she will 100 per cent kiss back.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.040
She don't give a fuck.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.560
If they actually have,
Kayleigh's gonna lose her shit.

11:53.640 --> 11:57.000
I'm 100 per cent Team Kayleigh.
I absolutely adore her.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.200
So if Mel's kissed Ashley,
I'll be fucking fuming.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.800
And Kayleigh is gonna hit
the fucking roof.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.000
(all cheering)

12:06.280 --> 12:10.560
This can be for you, Charlotte,
but I should take the note out.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.640
Do you wanna know
what the note read?

12:12.720 --> 12:14.720
Yeah.
"Sorry, Kayleigh."

12:14.800 --> 12:17.160
"He was your man,
but he's mine now."

12:17.240 --> 12:19.120
(all) Oh!
Did yous kiss?

12:19.200 --> 12:20.360
Yeah.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.600
I think Mel is a fucking bitch.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.360
She loves herself so much
and she's not even pretty.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.440
Do you reckon you'll be
getting cained or what?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.480
I'll do what I want.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.320
When Kayleigh returns,
hopefully it will push Mel away.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.040
My opportunity to swoop in.

12:40.120 --> 12:44.240
I swear to God, this fucking villa
is gonna be fucked tonight.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.440
Oh, I just... Oh.
This is a bad day for you.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.720
Fucking hell.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.360
Everything from the water
has been dog shite.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.040
So I'm expecting another dog
to come out

13:00.120 --> 13:02.600
and provide shit
to go back into the villa.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.000
Being at the beach
is never a good situation to be in.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.840
I'm absolutely shitting my pants.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.920
Who the hell is coming out
of the sea?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.760
(sighs)

13:39.960 --> 13:42.440
Oh, my God, it's Joss!
Hello.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.320
Hi.
Girls.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.360
Joss Mooney walked out of the sea
and he's mine and Kayleigh's ex.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.760
With me, it was just sex.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.800
(chuckles)

13:53.880 --> 13:54.920
You all right?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.440
Great! Another ex. Another problem.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.040
How are you? You all right?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.960
Nice tan.
I know, right?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.840
A little Action Man.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.720
Did you pack that?
No, this is me.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.840
It's all natural.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.400
(narrator) 'Blond bombshell Joss
is back from series one.'

14:10.480 --> 14:11.800
Oh, dear.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.400
'Last time,
he arrived as Talitha's ex

14:14.480 --> 14:16.520
and caused trouble with her
and Ash.'

14:16.600 --> 14:19.320
What would you do if he found out
about our kiss?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.040
Ash. Ash.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.720
'But it was Farah
who stole his heart.'

14:26.760 --> 14:29.840
Last time I was on Ex On The Beach,
I got too comfortable.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
I settled down with one girl.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.040
This time, I'm single,
back in my element.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.600
If there's a girl I like,
I'm gonna go for her.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.480
So, how long were you and Kayleigh
together for?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.280
Six months?

14:44.360 --> 14:45.920
Eight months.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.160
Eight months, to be precise.
OK.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.200
It was a great relationship.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.480
But he cheated on me. I'm over it.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.320
Kayleigh's getting with Ash.
God.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.840
Kayleigh and Ash.
It's not really an issue.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.440
Ash is a mate.
Kayleigh can do what she wants.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.440
(tablet dings)

15:03.520 --> 15:04.880
Fuck off.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.520
"Welcome to the beach, Joss.
It's date time for you and Lillie."

15:08.600 --> 15:12.360
"A chance to stir the senses
and melt each other's hearts.'

15:13.200 --> 15:17.520
Fresh piece of meat. Looks tasty.
Can't wait to get my claws in.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.040
Do what you wanna do.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.240
If you kiss him,
it honestly would not bother me.

15:22.320 --> 15:26.480
Kayleigh's given me the all-clear.
So, game on. See what happens.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.800
Right, Lills. Come on.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.680
Let's go for our date.
Have fun, guys.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.880
I'm in a predicament

15:31.960 --> 15:34.400
because however Ash has behaved
on his date,

15:34.480 --> 15:36.880
determines how I behave with Ashley.

15:41.560 --> 15:46.120
We're having a white party tonight.
Everyone looks sick. Whoo!

15:47.240 --> 15:49.040
I don't know what to tell you.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.880
Calm before the storm.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.840
Let's toast to
the calm before the storm.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.520
(Hawley) I'm buzzing. Hopefully
everyone will have a good time.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.960
Can't see it happening.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.880
When Kayleigh comes in,
you're telling her we kissed.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.680
I can't be arsed talking to her.

16:06.160 --> 16:10.360
Everybody might need to wear black.
It might be my funeral.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.000
Kayleigh's been shitting herself
about it.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.720
She's got a reason to, now.
(squeals)

16:15.800 --> 16:18.200
What a fucking bitch you are!

16:18.280 --> 16:21.200
You're only fucking doing this
to piss Kayleigh off.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.640
You are a twat.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.360
If we said we're friends,
then Ash would be off limits.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.600
But civil isn't friends, so...

16:28.680 --> 16:31.120
Bring it on, baby. (giggles)

16:40.240 --> 16:42.120
Well, this is awkward.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.880
It's Kayleigh's ex.
I can see in her eyes. It's Joss.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.440
I walk back in, I see Melissa
and her smug little face

16:49.520 --> 16:52.520
and I'm thinking
something's definitely happened.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.240
Kayleigh's been crying.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.080
He's on a date with Lillie.

16:57.160 --> 17:01.480
I think Kayleigh knows by the look
on Melissa's face what's happened.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.520
Do you wanna talk?
You look like you're gonna cry.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.440
Do you know what? Fuck everyone.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.040
I don't want to be here.
Everyone in there can fuck off.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.400
I think she's just upset about
thinking about you guys.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.280
I don't know what's happened.
She's had a shit day.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.760
I realised there's more emotion
there for her.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.920
Do you know what's gone on?
Basically, I kissed Ash today.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
What the fuck? Why would you
wanna get with that skank?

17:28.079 --> 17:31.200
You promised her
you wouldn't get with anyone else.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.600
I run outside.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.080
Kayleigh is crying her eyes out.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.240
Please speak to me.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.240
(sobbing)

17:46.320 --> 17:50.160
We all expected Kayleigh to be
fucking guns blazing, fuming.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.480
I did not expect my girl
to be crying her eyes out.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.920
Ash and Mel should feel like shit.
You're both pricks.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.160
All I'm saying is she's broken.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.200
So...
You knew what it would do, Ash.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.600
Listen, if I come back
with half my face cut off

18:07.680 --> 18:09.560
you'll realise what happened.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.920
It's more serious than I thought.
I need to speak to her.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.440
It's horrible seeing you like this.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.400
I knew this was gonna happen.

18:18.480 --> 18:22.480
I'm hysterically crying
and all I see in the corner of my eye

18:22.560 --> 18:26.840
is that man's flip flops.
What the fuck is he doing here?

18:26.920 --> 18:30.040
What do you want to say to me
that I don't already know?

18:30.120 --> 18:32.920
Get the fuck away from me!

18:35.360 --> 18:37.840
(narrator)
'With Ash's night in tatters,

18:37.920 --> 18:40.360
whose life will be shredded to pieces

18:40.440 --> 18:42.840
with the arrival
of another unwanted ex?'

18:42.920 --> 18:45.800
'Whose ex is next?'

18:50.080 --> 18:52.160
It's amazing. Do you wanna try some?

18:52.240 --> 18:55.160
'Looks like things
are getting a little sticky.'

18:55.240 --> 18:58.520
We're making chocolate.
We've got silly hats on.

18:58.600 --> 19:02.520
It's so much fun.
It's exactly what I needed.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.440
What are we writing on this?

19:04.520 --> 19:06.120
OK.
How do you feel right now?

19:06.200 --> 19:08.360
You want me to write that out?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.000
Oh, I know what it is already!

19:14.080 --> 19:16.360
What a way to start a first date.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.560
I say, "What's the first word
that comes into your head?"

19:19.640 --> 19:21.480
Typical guy. "Horny."

19:22.280 --> 19:25.520
The date is going amazing.
I look like a right doughnut.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.480
I'm sure I'm going to be
licking chocolate off Lillie soon.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.680
In my mouth, OK?
Just in your mouth.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.800
In and around your mouth.
I'm joking.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.080
I'm getting good vibes.
Fuck it. I'm going in for the kiss.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.000
Typical.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.800
He tried to give me a kiss.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.800
I didn't feel comfortable
doing that.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.120
Obviously very horny
and definitely very excited.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.280
(both chuckle)

19:52.360 --> 19:54.920
I do fancy Lillie
despite the funny hats.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.760
Wicked girl. Really attractive.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.200
Thank you.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.040
After tonight,
I feel really confused.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.280
Joss is lovely,
but I think I still fancy Bear.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.600
Kaleigh needs to come in here
and show Melissa who's boss.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.480
Kayleigh actually had a little bit
of faith in Mel today.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.560
And what has she gone and done?
Fucking mugged her off.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.360
Melissa's got no friends.
She's a bitch.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.040
I've got no friends
and I'm a bitch?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.360
Yes, babe.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.920
She doesn't care
that she's got no friends.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.640
She just wants to cause shit.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.240
She doesn't give a fuck.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.040
How the fuck am I a bitch
when you're the one

20:39.120 --> 20:42.240
who fucks someone's ex?
Have I fucked guys since I got in?

20:42.320 --> 20:45.240
I don't know, Lillie.
You've got loyalty to that girl.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.360
She's your friend.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.240
Four months ago, best friends.
Cuts me off.

20:49.320 --> 20:53.800
I've got so much anger for Kayleigh
cos we were fucking good friends

20:53.880 --> 20:56.440
and she can fuck me off so quickly,

20:56.520 --> 20:58.920
and then expects me
to still have loyalties

20:59.000 --> 21:00.440
when I go on a date with Ash.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.080
No, ta, love.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.000
Kayleigh's told us different.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.640
Kaleigh will...
Kayleigh will tell you what?

21:08.640 --> 21:10.160
Wow.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.200
We're talking about
what we fell out about.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.200
You're a dirty little tramp.
Dirty tramp?

21:16.280 --> 21:19.920
Don't complain to me
that you ever want to be my friend.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.160
I don't want
to be your friend ever.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.640
That's why I kissed Ash.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.440
Fuck off, dirty little slut.

21:25.520 --> 21:29.920
Mel knows mine and Ash's history
so for her to use that,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.560
she's a sly little slut.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.280
And as far as I'm concerned,

21:33.360 --> 21:36.120
she's laid her bed,
she can fucking lie in it.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.560
Do you want to talk to Kayleigh?
I don't want to talk to her.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.640
What the fuck?

21:40.720 --> 21:43.240
Fucking God! I swear! Melissa!

21:43.320 --> 21:45.160
She has fucked it now.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.680
Honestly, yeah.
I spoke to you this morning.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.840
We need to be civil.
Shut up!

21:50.920 --> 21:52.560
I spoke to you this morning.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.800
You didn't say
you wanna be my friend, no?

21:54.880 --> 21:58.480
Kayleigh's shouting this shit at me.
It's the same broken record.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.840
She can fuck herself.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.800
You said you wanted to be civil!

22:02.880 --> 22:05.600
So I'll fucking be civil with you!

22:05.680 --> 22:08.680
When I argue, I'm vicious.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.800
If something hurts you,
that's what I will attack.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.000
You're a fucking slag!

22:14.080 --> 22:16.840
(both shouting and swearing)

22:16.920 --> 22:19.120
You've got tits like dogs' ears.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.360
You've got fake fucking tits!

22:21.440 --> 22:23.360
Is this a fucking joke?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.280
You need a man to stand by you.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.040
I don't need him to.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.560
In life, you can't do shit.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.840
Who the fuck are ya?
I need him to...

22:31.920 --> 22:34.880
This wasn't about him.
This is about you.

22:34.960 --> 22:38.560
Ash is stood in the middle
and he looks embarrassed

22:38.640 --> 22:42.400
to have Melissa as someone he chose
over someone like me.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.280
I thought you had more...

22:44.360 --> 22:46.200
Fuck off, you slag!

22:48.160 --> 22:49.680
You're a mess.
Fuck you!

22:49.760 --> 22:51.120
You are an absolute mess.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.280
It looks like a Westlife music video
gone terribly wrong.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.080
That's what you want?
That's what you want?

23:09.160 --> 23:12.840
I thought our fucking friendship
meant more than that trollop!

23:15.040 --> 23:17.560
'Kayleigh's taking a break
from the group,

23:17.640 --> 23:21.360
just in time to avoid ex Joss's
stylish entrance.'

23:21.440 --> 23:25.800
I walk in with Lillie
and this place is insane.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.640
So, how was the date, then?
It was good, mate.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.960
Good. Decent.

23:31.040 --> 23:35.320
Mate, you look really cool
in your stupid fucking chef's hat.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.680
Did yous kiss?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.280
Yes.
Yeah, we had a little kiss.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.880
(all) Whoo!

23:41.960 --> 23:45.120
I'm so happy that Lillie and Joss
have kissed

23:45.200 --> 23:49.120
and now me and Gaz
are going to have a great night.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.080
(narrator) 'Don't hold your breath.
This is Ex On The Beach.'

23:53.160 --> 23:56.680
'Anyone can show up
and turn your world upside down.'

23:56.760 --> 23:59.160
'Whose ex is next?'

23:59.240 --> 24:00.920
(cackles evilly)

24:03.480 --> 24:05.720
(tablet dings, all groan)

24:05.800 --> 24:08.280
I started to think
it was such a good night.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.800
"Date time in the penthouse for
Melissa and a man of her choice."

24:11.880 --> 24:12.920
Yes!

24:13.000 --> 24:15.040
"After all, it's your birthday."

24:15.120 --> 24:16.280
Is it your birthday?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.760
Yeah, it's my birthday.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.880
Happy birthday! (laughs)

24:20.960 --> 24:24.360
I couldn't give a fuck
if it's her birthday or not.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.000
No one wants
to celebrate her existence.

24:27.080 --> 24:31.200
It's between... Ash or Gaz.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.280
Melissa, you've got enough shit
going on, believe me,

24:34.360 --> 24:36.160
without trying to fuck me.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.320
I don't know.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.680
Ash.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.320
Are you having to decide
between me and Gaz?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.480
Fuck her, I'm gonna have fun tonight.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.280
We had a good date today.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.760
You had a chance to take me
to the penthouse.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.080
You chose... "Hm, I don't know.
Gaz or Ashley."

24:53.160 --> 24:56.240
I've known Gaz...
I'm not finished yet.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.360
I fucking love you guys.
You love me.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.640
Whoever wants to go to the penthouse,
keep it to them self.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.440
I'm partying.
Let's get the fucking drinks in.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.040
(all cheer)

25:06.120 --> 25:07.720
(shouts)

25:07.800 --> 25:10.280
(cheering)

25:10.360 --> 25:15.440
I'm so proud of him in saying,
"No, Melissa. The joke's on you."

25:29.360 --> 25:31.720
Mel turns on the waterworks.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.840
Babe, no one gives a fuck.
We're having a well good pool party.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.240
Everyone's ganging up on me.
It isn't fair.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.800
This is the worst fucking birthday.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.680
(gang cheering)

25:45.760 --> 25:48.440
(narrator)
'As Mel's night looking over...'

25:50.040 --> 25:52.240
'Bear's is just beginning.'

25:52.320 --> 25:56.400
To the penthouse, get up there.
Sexy time tonight, baby!

25:56.480 --> 25:58.000
(panting)

26:00.880 --> 26:02.680
'...and not wanting to miss out,

26:02.760 --> 26:05.200
Ash is cooking up something
with Kayleigh.'

26:05.280 --> 26:07.920
I'm sorry for what I did,
but it was for a reason.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.480
At the end of the day,
I could've gone along with it

26:11.560 --> 26:13.040
and then let Mel...

26:13.120 --> 26:15.640
So, what? Today was for this reason?

26:15.720 --> 26:18.360
I don't even fancy her.
I don't like blonde.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.760
I swear to God.
You're such a dickhead!

26:21.840 --> 26:23.600
(shrieks)

26:23.680 --> 26:25.920
No! I hate you!

26:26.000 --> 26:27.760
Give me a kiss.
No!

26:38.080 --> 26:40.440
As last days go,
this has been good.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.040
I woke up next to Bear
so I'm pretty happy.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.640
(hums)

26:46.720 --> 26:49.680
Last night with Aimee
was a bit of fun.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.200
Lillie is the girl of my dreams,
but I can't sleep with her.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.800
That's why I banged Aimee,
got the heebie-jeebies out.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.040
I'm reset again. I want to get
my Princess Lillie back.

27:02.920 --> 27:07.320
Waking up this morning
after yesterday's shitty day

27:07.400 --> 27:10.080
I actually feel
surprisingly relieved.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.760
Last night,
the group really came together

27:13.840 --> 27:17.360
and demonstrated karma is a bitch.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.360
This morning, go to breakfast,

27:19.440 --> 27:22.800
sit by myself.
No one's fucking talking to me.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.480
What a great birthday.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.120
The wrong person.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.520
This cunt.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
Ashley!

27:39.680 --> 27:42.200
Last night, I fucking smashed it!

27:42.280 --> 27:44.880
Think I was gonna let Mel
mug me off?

27:44.960 --> 27:48.200
I told that sketty Betty
to get back down to the penthouse

27:48.280 --> 27:51.080
while I gave Kayleigh
the best night of her life.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.240
I feel like I've got
to say something after last night.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.960
You disrespect me like that again,

27:57.040 --> 27:59.760
and I'll fucking rip
your eyeballs out, OK, babe?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.800
I hate him with a passion.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.680
(narrator) 'As it's the last day,

28:06.760 --> 28:09.320
the Tablet of Terror
is throwing a party...'

28:09.400 --> 28:12.040
Yeah! It's a fucking beach party!

28:13.480 --> 28:16.400
'...for everyone's favourite
birthday girl.'

28:16.480 --> 28:17.800
Wow!

28:17.880 --> 28:20.600
We're having a fucking ball
at the beach party.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.960
Shame it's fucking
Mel Reeves's birthday. Fuck's sake.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.800
(all cheer)

28:30.960 --> 28:34.080
Happy birthday, Mel.
Everyone fucking hates ya.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.280
I fancy Lillie.
I'm gonna try and rekindle things.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.720
Everyone makes mistakes, don't they?

28:48.800 --> 28:51.560
Bear said he wants to spend
tonight with me.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.600
I'm aware of what Bear's like.
But I am here to have fun.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.520
So, why not?

28:56.600 --> 29:00.360
As it's the last night, like.
I don't care about fucking birds.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.160
Just want to give you a cuddle.
I miss ya.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.680
He was with me last night.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.960
You're lucky you're pretty.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.240
We're back on. Best day ever.

29:11.320 --> 29:14.480
(narrator) 'With Melissa
now the pariah of the group,

29:14.560 --> 29:17.680
it's time for Hawley to swoop in.'

29:17.760 --> 29:21.280
My plan is to get with Melissa.
I'm going to take my chance.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.760
I think you came in here
towards the end.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.440
Everyone's in a tight group.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.640
When it kicks off,
they go to Kayleigh.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.840
It's pathetic.
The type of people that do that.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.480
They've just stuck with Kayleigh
and not tried to get to know me.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.960
Made me feel awkward. Fuck them.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.640
It's not nice to see you upset
on your birthday.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.360
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.560
I'm having the worst time ever.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.480
I hate it. I'm bored.
I've got no good company.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.400
Shit birthday.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.040
(narrator) 'Nice try.
You should get some tips from Bear. '

29:58.200 --> 30:00.320
I look over
and Bear's kissing Lillie.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.360
She's a fucking mug. I feel sick.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.160
How dare Bear think
he can just mug me off?

30:05.240 --> 30:08.200
It's not happening.
I will get payback.

30:14.600 --> 30:19.000
Bear has really fucked me off.
He's used me to make Lillie jealous.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.320
And to, basically, have sex.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.520
How the fuck can you
do that to someone?

30:23.600 --> 30:25.120
Why are you such a prick?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.880
Bear deserved that. He's ridiculous.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.440
What's wrong?
You're the biggest mug.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.800
OK. Why's that?

30:32.880 --> 30:34.400
You slept with me last night

30:34.480 --> 30:36.960
and today you're cracking on
with Lillie.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.920
Awkward.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Me and Lillie had a thing.
It was really special.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.160
She went through a tough time
with Gaz

30:44.240 --> 30:46.360
and I'm not going to be a rebound.

30:46.440 --> 30:51.320
Bear, your ego is as big as my dick.
Pipe down, you silly little cunt.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.240
You came, we slept together.

30:53.320 --> 30:57.040
Love, I'm sorry I said
I'd spend the day with you today.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.840
This morning, you were with me.

30:58.920 --> 31:02.040
What do you expect?
Me to like someone and stay?

31:04.440 --> 31:05.680
I'm Bear.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.120
Yeah, I do lie in the villa.
I can't help it.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.040
You're a twat.
The thing is...

31:10.120 --> 31:12.400
I'm over it. Get over yourself.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.960
I'm done with Bear. What a wanker.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.920
(narrator) 'As it's the last night,
in true Ex On The Beach style,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.960
the Tablet of Terror has thrown
an awards ceremony

31:28.040 --> 31:31.080
to celebrate the villa's
many achievements.'

31:31.160 --> 31:32.760
I think we need to toast.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.120
To a lot of fun, drama
and a good night.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.440
It's been a pleasure being here!
(all cheer)

31:38.520 --> 31:41.600
'Don't tell me you've forgotten
this lot already.'

31:41.680 --> 31:42.720
Oh, for...

31:48.040 --> 31:51.200
You called her a dog earlier.
Oops. Sorry, Bear.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.800
(shouting)

31:52.880 --> 31:54.680
You're such a fucking wanker.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.880
(shouting)

32:00.760 --> 32:02.160
(all laugh)

32:02.240 --> 32:04.400
I don't kiss people on first dates.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.440
She is a fun sponge.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.160
Don't push me again!
Fuck off!

32:09.240 --> 32:11.480
Just fuck off! I mean it, fuck off!

32:11.560 --> 32:12.720
Where am I gonna go?

32:18.440 --> 32:19.960
I'm looking for the four Fs.

32:20.040 --> 32:23.520
Fit, fun, flirty
and fucking massive tits.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.280
Liam is so irritating.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.920
I'll call it a day with Olivia.
Getting fucking nowhere.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.560
I'm absolutely gutted.
I'm sick as a cunt.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.240
Fucking king, baby! Look!
Hold tight!

32:40.320 --> 32:43.400
The girls won't shake our hands,
let alone suck our dicks.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.880
Come here. Give me a kiss.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.440
It leaves me to swoop in
and crack on with Chrysten.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.240
I'm a new Jemma.
Blondes have more fun.

32:57.320 --> 33:00.160
Guys, would you like to show me
the penthouse?

33:00.240 --> 33:02.280
Right, who wants to finger me?

33:03.600 --> 33:06.240
The love of my life is here...

33:06.320 --> 33:08.760
You fucked me off, Hawley.
Broke my heart.

33:08.840 --> 33:09.920
(arguing)

33:16.480 --> 33:19.400
First, most likely to win
a Nobel prize.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.640
Do you know what that means?
(all) No!

33:21.720 --> 33:23.520
Anyone want to explain?

33:23.600 --> 33:26.560
I think it means actress or actrum.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.040
(narrator)
'Actrum? Is that a new word?'

33:29.120 --> 33:30.560
I don't know what it means.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.240
A Nobel prize is
the biggest peacekeeper.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.040
Nobel Peace Award, yeah.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.720
(both) You.
Thank you very much.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.200
My experience in the villa
has been fucking crazy.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.040
But I've loved it.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.280
I've not got into any fights.
Wicked.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.040
Biggest ego in the villa?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.400
It's Gaz.
Come on, man.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.680
(others agree)

33:52.360 --> 33:55.800
Bear, if you could have sex
with yourself, you would.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.760
How have I got a big ego?

33:57.840 --> 33:59.240
I haven't.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.840
You do talk about yourself
quite a lot.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.560
If you're going to play the ego game,
let's play.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.360
I've got more followers
than all of yous combined, times two.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.080
(narrator) 'No ego there.'

34:11.159 --> 34:12.639
Worst drunk in the villa.

34:12.719 --> 34:13.880
(all) Holly!
Yeah!

34:13.960 --> 34:17.239
Stop touching me! Get off me!

34:17.320 --> 34:20.080
Get the fuck away from me!

34:20.159 --> 34:21.239
(laughter)

34:21.320 --> 34:26.280
I am so fucking proud of that!
Best drunk ever!

34:26.360 --> 34:28.400
OK. Biggest bitch.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.560
It's obviously Mel.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.000
You're a dirty old cow.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.960
You're a fucking slag.
You fucked everyone!

34:36.040 --> 34:38.639
Who the fuck does she think she is?

34:38.719 --> 34:40.440
Fucking droopy-ass tits slag.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.040
I agree.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.120
I think I'm the biggest bitch.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.800
It was shit anyway.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.960
Who do you think is the most boring?

34:48.040 --> 34:49.960
Conor!

34:50.040 --> 34:51.560
Conor!
(woman)No, no, no.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.320
Conor's the most boring.

34:53.400 --> 34:57.080
He's the most boring.
All he does is chat shit all day.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.000
He's a roofer, on peanuts.
So I'm not bothered.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.200
I'll do his wage in a day.
He earns all my wage in one day.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.640
Congratulations, millionaire!

35:06.720 --> 35:08.680
Sorry I'm skint and get the birds.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.320
Conor, I may not have no money,

35:11.400 --> 35:14.080
but I'll still fuck your mum
and your sister.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.160
I'll give you 50 per cent off
if you want your roof done.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.160
'There. The dickhead discount.'

35:19.240 --> 35:23.560
Who do you think is the
biggest fucking wanker in the villa?

35:23.640 --> 35:26.040
Gaz, for what he's done to Lillie.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.320
While Gaz was with Lillie,
did you get together?

35:29.400 --> 35:30.960
Yes.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.360
I'm actually, like, gobsmacked.
I'm thrown.

35:34.440 --> 35:37.000
Melissa Reeves.
Why is that so bad?

35:37.080 --> 35:40.200
That's one of the people
I slept with behind your back.

35:42.920 --> 35:46.760
Conor, you're one that calls
people out on their jobs back home.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.160
Mate, you pour drinks for girls
in a nightclub.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.440
I'm just saying...

35:52.520 --> 35:54.160
For Lillie's situation.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.360
That's all.
Don't take it personally.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.480
Conor... Shut up.
It's only for me.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.280
If you want to go in,
next time you need a lift to work,

36:01.360 --> 36:03.000
I can take you, in my Bentley.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.160
(narrator) 'Still no ego, then.'

36:05.240 --> 36:07.680
Who is the prom queen?
Charlotte Dawson.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.200
Need a fucking crown!

36:09.280 --> 36:10.920
Give her the crown!

36:11.000 --> 36:14.760
My dad, Les, would be
so chuffing proud of me right now.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.280
Last one is a biggie.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.920
Prom king. All right?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.440
But, erm,
I entered the villa as the king,

36:22.520 --> 36:25.040
and I'm gonna leave it that way.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.560
I walked in here saying
I was king of the villa

36:27.640 --> 36:29.360
and my time here
has proved it.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.160
I'm leaving wearing my crown.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.280
I love you!

36:37.080 --> 36:39.880
(narrator) 'With the last night
coming to an end,

36:39.960 --> 36:41.600
Gaz puts his ego aside

36:41.680 --> 36:44.760
and makes one final heartfelt gesture
to Lillie.'

36:48.280 --> 36:50.120
I wanted to pull Lillie to the side

36:50.200 --> 36:52.640
to make sure
we are leaving as friends.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.760
I've had a lot of stuff go on here
with the whole, like,

36:56.840 --> 37:00.120
Chrysten and Mel
and the fact I cheated on you.

37:00.200 --> 37:04.120
And the other night
when you were crying,

37:04.200 --> 37:10.200
like, that does, I hope,
still prove that I care about you.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.920
Gary's eyes are filling up
talking to me. He's sincere.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.920
I'm sorry, so sorry I cheated on you.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
I honestly...
I'll always care about you a lot.

37:22.080 --> 37:25.000
You'd think after all
the chats we've had

37:25.080 --> 37:28.400
it would get easier,
but, in a way, it gets harder.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.080
We had some of the best times ever

37:31.160 --> 37:33.800
and I'm sorry that things
came out in here.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.800
I actually wish now
that when I finished with Lillie,

37:36.880 --> 37:38.680
I had told her I had cheated on her

37:38.760 --> 37:41.720
because coming out
in this environment was not easy.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.440
I fucked it a few times.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.080
I've been caught out
and I'm sorry about that.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.320
The rest of our relationship
was real.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.800
I just hope that
what I've done to Lillie

37:50.880 --> 37:54.400
hasn't scarred her and
affected the way she is with lads.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.160
I didn't think I had
any more tears left to cry.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.880
That's my fault.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.320
I came here to get closure
with Gary.

38:02.400 --> 38:05.240
It hasn't been the easiest journey

38:05.320 --> 38:08.680
but I'm going to be going home
a much stronger person.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.920
Who the fuck wears knickers?

38:37.080 --> 38:38.680
Have I got a good one?

38:45.120 --> 38:47.040
That boy has fucked it with me.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.720
Shitter.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.280
It's about we just drew a line
and she would fuck off.

39:09.960 --> 39:13.920
You've got tits like dogs' ears.
Fuck off, you dirty little slut.
