00:04.800 --> 00:08.639
Aldo Moro e'morto. L'ex Primo Ministro,
Aldo Moro, e'stato assassinato.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.719
Il corpo e'stato trovato
con dieci proiettili...

00:12.800 --> 00:15.519
... in via Michelangelo Caetani
in Roma...

00:17.680 --> 00:19.359
... posso confermare
che Aldo Moro...

00:19.440 --> 00:24.239
... ex Primo Ministro e leader della
Democrazia Cristiana, e'stato assassinato.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.479
Jessica.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.439
Who is that?

00:47.520 --> 00:49.919
- Me.
- Yes. Who's that?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.959
- A frog.
- What has he got on his head?

00:54.040 --> 00:55.399
A crown.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.279
Wow.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.239
Jessica?

01:24.120 --> 01:26.519
I need to talk
to someone.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.039
Can you stay
with this man?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.879
I asked if you recognised this.

01:46.960 --> 01:51.599
It's a document containing
the identity of Mr. Rabbit.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.519
It was sent to an Italian journalist
called Mino Pecorelli.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.679
Say hello, Mino.

02:01.000 --> 02:01.959
Ciao.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.639
Mino's the man who pinned the death
of Aldo Moro on the CIA for us.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.039
Mino's with us.
Aren't you, Mino?

02:15.400 --> 02:19.159
Getting this
was a shock for Mino.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.239
It blew his mind, in fact.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.399
And we were...
very, very lucky

02:25.480 --> 02:27.359
... it was sent to him.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.719
Weren't we, Mino?

02:35.480 --> 02:37.999
Do you recognise it, Philip?

02:40.880 --> 02:42.639
Well, you should.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.479
You fucking sent it.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.639
I've finished Janus.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.239
What?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.079
Does it work?

02:58.960 --> 03:04.119
It works perfectly. It's perfect.
But... I've made an adjustment to it.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.159
I've changed it.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.239
- What adjustment?
- Milner... I've changed it.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.799
What have you done?
What is the adjustment?

03:12.880 --> 03:16.239
You can't use it.
You can never use what I've made.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.799
Give me Janus
by the end of the week.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.279
Or we'll torture Jessica.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.759
Queues formed outside bakers' shops
throughout England and Wales...

04:01.840 --> 04:05.279
... with most stores limiting customers
to one loaf apiece.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.519
The Electricity Council have now
drawn up their contingency plans...

04:08.600 --> 04:11.639
... for cuts and disconnections
once the strike begins...

04:11.720 --> 04:13.119
... and the supplies
to the power stations...

04:13.200 --> 04:15.479
It has really been
quite remarkable...

04:15.560 --> 04:19.079
... what has been achieved in these
last few weeks of the three-day week...

04:19.160 --> 04:21.879
... by British industry,
because of all the arrangements...

04:21.960 --> 04:24.199
... which have been made
by the unions and the employers...

04:24.280 --> 04:26.959
... and they ought to have
full credit...

04:42.200 --> 04:45.919
- What did you do to my Pietre?
- Christ, Brosca. Not this again.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.279
- I'm his father. Why would I...
- I take him to the doctor!

04:48.360 --> 04:52.639
The doctor said it is shock, like trauma.
What did you do to him?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.559
Why did you do that?

04:54.640 --> 04:57.279
He doesn't need a shrink.
You need to take your pills.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.639
I'm not taking your pills!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.919
You poison me.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.959
What did you do to him?
I fucking kill you!

05:05.040 --> 05:08.079
What did you do to him?
I fucking kill you!

05:08.160 --> 05:11.239
I really fucking kill you!

05:18.200 --> 05:19.439
Mr. Carvel?

06:15.840 --> 06:19.639
And it's so simple,
it's... it's almost elegant.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.799
It has the speed,
it has the effectiveness...

06:22.880 --> 06:27.599
... so we introduce the fungus
to the gut of the mosquito.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.999
We just need
a more virulent strain.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.959
Ending the mosquito
ends malaria.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.159
Dengue fever, yellow fever,
West Nile virus.

06:37.240 --> 06:41.119
- We believe we are very close...
- It won't work.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.959
I beg your pardon?

06:43.040 --> 06:47.079
M. anisopliae? That's what
you're talking about? It won't work.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.479
There's poor stability
in the sporulating strains.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.159
You'll get 35%  effectiveness at best
before the mosquito out-evolves it.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.759
We believe...

06:54.840 --> 06:57.639
Besides, there are
3,500 species of mosquito.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.999
They've been around
for 100 million years.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.039
You think you can just
yank them out of existence?

07:03.120 --> 07:07.399
I mean, you do realise half the birds
in the Arctic tundra will starve to death?

07:07.480 --> 07:12.399
I mean, you have actually thought of that
or are you just fucking idiots?

07:12.960 --> 07:15.919
- And how would you cure malaria?
- Cure malaria?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.319
Why would we want
to cure malaria?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.879
Malaria's doing a great job.
Leave malaria alone.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.199
Young man, you're drunk.

07:23.320 --> 07:28.039
Yes, I am, and in the morning
we'll both still be cunts.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.999
Have you come here
just to drink?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.559
There's a blackout
everywhere else.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.639
It's only held
once every four years, this.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.679
The idea is to get people together
who could never normally talk.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.959
Like politicians, world leaders...

08:00.640 --> 08:02.599
... scientists.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.999
No-one knows it exists.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.839
Is that what you are?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.999
A scientist, then?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.239
Must be a good one
to get into here.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.999
Must be some kind of genius
to get into here.

08:15.080 --> 08:20.559
No offence. I'm sure you're great.
But why don't you just fuck off?

08:21.360 --> 08:23.439
Why don't you make me?

08:25.840 --> 08:28.279
What's wrong with
curing malaria?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.719
Or don't you want to make the world
a better place?

08:31.800 --> 08:35.359
Let me explain
something to you.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.479
The sun throws a certain amount
of energy onto this planet.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.039
We turn it into food,
clothing, shelter, et cetera.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.639
It supports
an amount of us...

08:42.720 --> 08:47.439
... and it took 30,000 years
for that amount to become one billion.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.719
Then we found a way
to use ancient sunlight...

08:49.800 --> 08:54.079
... sunlight trapped in oil and coal.
We started to live off that.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.559
What happened?

08:55.640 --> 08:58.919
In just 130 years,
our population doubled.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.079
The next billion took 30 years.
The fourth billion has taken just 14.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.919
So, here's the question.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.079
What do you think is going to happen
when that oil and coal runs out...

09:10.160 --> 09:12.599
... in, say, 100 years?

09:12.680 --> 09:17.399
When there's 10 billion living on a planet
that can support only one?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.559
I think we're going to
tear each other to shreds.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.239
At last.
Someone with an ounce of fucking brain.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.799
Malaria?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.919
The only disease
that needs curing is us.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.679
Go on, then.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.839
Let's throw ourselves off.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.439
What are you doing?

09:49.520 --> 09:52.239
Well, if there's no point
in being alive...

09:52.320 --> 09:55.919
All right, Okay, I get it.
Yeah, yeah, fine. I get what you...

09:56.000 --> 10:01.159
Look, look! That... that could tip!
Please don't do that. Please?

10:01.240 --> 10:04.879
- Have you ever been in a genocide?
- What?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.239
I have.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.559
So, if you have
some sort of answer...

10:12.120 --> 10:15.439
- ... I'd like to hear it.
- I have an answer.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.439
No-one wants to listen to me.
They're all too fucking scared.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.399
But if you come down
off that table, I will tell you.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.719
Look, it's a rabbit.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.359
See?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.919
Do you like the rabbit?
Do you like it?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.919
It's fine, Brosca.
He'll grow out of it.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.759
Just a phase.
He's fine.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.239
This is incredible.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.679
Some of those scientists
are Nobel laureates.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.999
So?
They think you're a god.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.079
Don't laugh.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.119
Do you see the way
they behave around you?

12:57.200 --> 13:00.479
- They're small compared to you.
- I can't think like that.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.359
Why? Because it's true?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.599
I'm confused by what I feel.

13:11.560 --> 13:17.159
Each day is momentous. Each minute,
every decision, every action is...

13:18.600 --> 13:20.599
... historic.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.839
And I feel separate.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.999
You know?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.359
Do you feel that?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.479
That separation?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.359
See?

13:36.800 --> 13:39.119
You are a fucking god.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.159
Janus, it's called "Janus"...

13:43.240 --> 13:46.679
... and, um...
it's a protein and it's incredible.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.279
The hard part was making it
so it can't be detected.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.559
It's split into two elements,
which combine in the brain to create Janus.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.839
It then sends signals that alter
the production of cohesion in fertility.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.719
Essentially, it switches off
human reproduction.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.399
It's, um... amazing.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.599
Philip, when you say
"it switches off human reproduction"...

14:07.680 --> 14:09.119
... we're not trying to end
the human race.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.759
We use a placebo.
We leave 5 to 8% unaffected.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.039
- They'll remain fertile.
- And who do we give that placebo to?

14:15.120 --> 14:18.759
There are certain genetic traits
that are undeniably advantageous.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.039
Now, I believe I've isolated a group
of people who are genetically stronger...

14:22.120 --> 14:24.599
Group? Do you mean a race?

14:28.600 --> 14:30.839
Race is not a term
that science recognises...

14:30.920 --> 14:32.319
... but, yes, if you must,
then "race".

14:32.400 --> 14:35.199
- That's the Third fucking Reich.
- It's the opposite of that.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.119
I'm not talking about murder.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.239
I'm talking about allowing some to continue.
A world without race.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.639
It's a world without
racial fucking genocide!

14:43.720 --> 14:47.559
- And can you make Janus decide?
- I could.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.359
I could find a combination of junk genes
that only a certain percentage have...

14:51.440 --> 14:53.639
... tailor Janus not to trigger
when those genes are present.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.479
Right, and that would be random?
Nothing would connect those people?

14:56.560 --> 14:59.919
No, it's junk DNA.
Doesn't do anything. But...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.239
... why not choose?

15:06.240 --> 15:08.959
Because that's not
who we are.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.879
So, you've been to Plovdiv?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.519
- Yes, I love Plovdiv.
- He hasn't been to fucking Plovdiv.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.599
What are you talk... I love Plovdiv.
Plovdiv's my favourite place.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.399
He is a fucking liar, Brosca.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.599
Okay, you tell me what is the name
of the main square in Plovdiv.

16:40.680 --> 16:44.359
Okay. The main square in Plovdiv, right?
It's got lots of little...

16:44.440 --> 16:48.359
So, the main square in Plovdiv
is called... Plovdiv Main Square.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.839
- You lied.
- They're a straight-speaking people.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.559
Shall we do the merengue? Yeah?
Hand on my shoulder.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.439
That's it. Watch my hips.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.479
- Shall I spin you around?
- She's lovely, Brosca.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.679
Merengue!

17:10.800 --> 17:12.559
Are you okay?

17:18.240 --> 17:20.599
Does he know what you do?
Tom.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.279
God, no.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.919
I love him.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.359
And I want him
to continue loving me.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.799
No, we can't. They're downstairs.
I'm supposed to be getting whiskey.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.759
You're driving me nuts. I'll be quick, I promise.
You won't even notice.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.199
Philip, I'm asking you.

18:34.720 --> 18:39.159
- You have not hurt our son, yes?
- Brosca, no!

18:39.680 --> 18:41.759
I would never hurt him.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.919
I'm...

18:47.880 --> 18:49.279
I'm pregnant.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.479
I going to have a baby,
Philip.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.799
Don't come in tomorrow.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.079
There's going to be
a gas leak.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.759
They know too much, Philip.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.479
Jesus Christ, Milner.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.319
Do you think they can walk around
talking about this?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.319
They're good people.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.799
Good?

20:19.280 --> 20:22.119
Why?
Because you know them?

20:24.560 --> 20:27.319
We're saving a species.

20:28.240 --> 20:34.199
Are these few more important than everyone
because you've become attached to them?

20:34.280 --> 20:38.159
We can't afford attachments,
Philip.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.559
You need to remember that.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.999
What have we got here?

20:58.400 --> 21:00.959
It's a rabbit. See?

21:01.720 --> 21:05.039
Do you like the rabbit?
Do you?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.959
You see?

21:11.680 --> 21:14.719
Do you like the rabbit?
You like it?

21:15.280 --> 21:17.639
Look how beautiful it is.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.439
Look.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.679
Try it.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.519
She'll be back in a minute.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.919
Just popped out.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.479
How are you, Tom?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.159
Yeah.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.319
Bit fucked, actually.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.399
- Do you need anything?
- No. No, no.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.479
I'm gonna go to one of those rehab places
they have now.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.559
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.639
That's great, Tom.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.599
I really think...

23:57.680 --> 24:00.799
... you know,
this time, you know?

24:02.880 --> 24:05.799
I heard about
the gas leak at the lab.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.399
She's devastated.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.199
It means so much to her.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.039
Your work.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.119
I've never seen her
so alive.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.159
She loves you, you know?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.119
Not like that.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.759
That she saves for me.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.239
With you, it's...

24:37.240 --> 24:39.239
... much higher.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.159
Brain love.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.999
She loves your brain.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.119
- Hey. Come here. Hey.
- Oh, Jesus.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.279
Let me get that for you.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.679
Did you get the medication?

25:15.760 --> 25:18.919
- I did, I did.
- Philip popped round.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.839
Okay. Feeling better?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.759
Philip Carvel?

25:38.200 --> 25:41.519
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of cruelty to a child.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.039
You do not have to say anything, but
anything you do say will be taken down...

26:14.520 --> 26:16.319
She's right.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.079
I experimented on him.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.639
I was trying to inhibit violence.
I needed a human subject.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.879
He was all I had.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.439
It changed him.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.639
I've been trying
to put it right.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.639
I can't.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.079
I'm sure
you had your reasons.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.399
Look, I love Brosca.
But this?

26:50.040 --> 26:52.119
She's harming you.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.839
Let me help you with her.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.919
She has to go.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.679
- She's coming between us.
- What about Tom?

27:01.960 --> 27:04.559
He's a fucking time bomb.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.719
It's your love for Tom
that puts us in danger.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.999
I don't feel like that about Brosca.
I don't feel like that about anyone.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.879
The only person
I feel like that about...

27:14.960 --> 27:16.599
... is you.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.799
You and what
we are doing together.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.559
No. No, Tom, please.

27:59.640 --> 28:02.639
Please don't do that.
Don't.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.679
I did ring.
I let myself in.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.799
We need to talk.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.159
Okay.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.839
- Okay, talk.
- Here?

28:23.360 --> 28:27.679
- This is quite sensitive.
- I said "talk".

28:27.760 --> 28:30.039
The Network lab in Tel Aviv.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.799
One of the men worked out
the RNA codes for Janus.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.719
He has an idea
of what it does.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.399
- Has he told anyone?
- Half the lab, as many as 50 people.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.959
We're not sure exactly who yet,
but we have it locked down.

28:42.040 --> 28:47.159
- Do you have a plane ready?
- TWA 841, heading to JFK.

28:47.240 --> 28:51.279
We've told them
they're going to be debriefed by the CIA.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.119
Well, you know
what we have to do, then.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.079
We have to bring it down.

29:03.600 --> 29:07.959
We have to plant a bomb aboard the plane
and we have to kill all of them.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.719
What are you talking about?
Killing? Killing who?

29:12.800 --> 29:17.959
Who you going to kill?
What you talking about planes and killing for?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.359
Mr. Carvel?

29:45.440 --> 29:48.079
There have been
some complications.

29:48.160 --> 29:52.759
I'm very sorry to tell you
but your wife didn't survive childbirth.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.879
Well, we always knew
it wasn't going to be easy, didn't we?

30:06.360 --> 30:08.479
We always knew that.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.999
There have to be sacrifices.

30:16.320 --> 30:21.919
We're making a new world, Philip.
We are creating utopia.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.199
Okay.

30:30.160 --> 30:34.719
You're special. You're unique.
So, yes, you can have the child.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.039
But don't get lost in her,
Philip.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.599
- Mr. Carvel?
- Please, don't get lost in...

30:41.680 --> 30:44.399
You've had a little girl.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.999
A girl.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.519
A little girl.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.639
She's...

30:56.600 --> 31:00.919
- ... she's beautiful.
- What are you going to call her?

31:01.000 --> 31:04.399
Jessica.
Her name is Jessica.

32:02.440 --> 32:05.799
Give me Janus
by the end of the week...

32:06.920 --> 32:09.559
... or we'll torture Jessica.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.319
Take this off.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.919
There you are.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.399
The continued waste collectors' strike
has led local authorities...

32:58.480 --> 33:02.479
... to store waste in car parks
with threats of a looming oil crisis...

33:02.560 --> 33:05.599
- ... talk of a state of emergency is...
- ... a vote of no confidence...

33:05.680 --> 33:07.319
... in the Labour Government
has been called.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.999
It's expected to come down
to just one or two votes.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.199
It was only two votes.
It's pretty... pretty tight.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.999
Indeed, but, you know,
when it's only two, anything can happen.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.239
Coffins?

33:22.440 --> 33:24.239
What a charming place to meet!

33:24.320 --> 33:26.519
Are these full?

33:27.640 --> 33:30.799
Oh... the gravediggers' strike.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.959
They're storing
the bodies here.

33:33.040 --> 33:37.359
The "Winter of Discontent", they're calling it.
Leicester Square's landfill.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.519
It's Philip.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.799
He's done it again.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.119
What?

33:44.200 --> 33:48.919
No. No, I spoke to him.
I've just come from Rome, where we spoke...

33:49.000 --> 33:50.439
- You spoke, he listened...
- ... and I told...

33:50.520 --> 33:52.639
... and then he did it again.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.639
Another document,
another leak.

33:57.160 --> 34:01.919
We think it's the same thing.
The identity of Mr. Rabbit.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.879
He sent it to Richard Sykes,
UK ambassador to Holland.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.159
We don't think
Sykes knows what it means.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.919
But why Sykes?
Why send it to him?

34:13.000 --> 34:16.079
If the Tories win the next election,
he's on security with Airey Neave.

34:16.160 --> 34:20.119
- Airey Neave? Well, has he seen it?
- We don't know.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.279
Look, why is Philip
doing this to us?

34:24.640 --> 34:26.719
He's finished Janus.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.439
But he's scared of it.

34:31.520 --> 34:35.159
He can't bring himself
to destroy it, so...

34:35.240 --> 34:38.439
... he's doing the next best thing,
he's destroying me.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.559
Jesus.
What the hell will he do next?

34:41.640 --> 34:43.799
Letan, I have men at the US lab,
armed men...

34:43.880 --> 34:47.239
No, no-one touches
Philip Carvel.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.359
Show me.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.319
Your loyalty breaks my heart.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.279
Deal with Sykes.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.319
Then we need to talk
to Airey Neave.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.199
At nine o'clock this morning, Sir Richard
was sitting inside his Rolls-Royce...

35:40.280 --> 35:41.879
... in the grounds
of his residence here...

35:41.960 --> 35:45.399
... preparing to drive the short distance
to the embassy in the centre of the Hague.

35:45.480 --> 35:49.719
At that time, two men rushed up on foot
and five shots were fired at the car.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.399
Sir Richard was hit,
and so was his 19-year-old footman...

35:52.480 --> 35:55.239
- ... who had just shut the door.
- Milner!

35:55.320 --> 35:58.159
It's an honour to meet you,
Mr. Neave.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.159
Mr. Neave, we believe you may have
received some information...

36:01.240 --> 36:05.039
... from Mr. Sykes before he died.
A document?

36:05.960 --> 36:10.879
I did!
Extraordinarily extravagant stuff.

36:10.960 --> 36:15.319
International conspiracies at the heart
of many governments, et cetera, et cetera.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.959
- It's terribly exciting reading.
- Well, as strange as it may seem...

36:19.040 --> 36:23.439
... we're worried that this information
may be putting your life at risk.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.239
Really? How dreadful.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.439
And do you know
who killed poor Richard yet?

36:30.520 --> 36:34.759
Not officially, but we believe
it was dissident Republicans.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.639
Do we?

36:36.720 --> 36:40.119
Are you talking about "we"
as in Ml5?

36:40.680 --> 36:46.159
Well, yes, I'm sure that "we"
does believe it was the IRA.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.559
Or the INLA.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.399
Or the RSPCA, for that matter.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.399
But you and I, Milner...

36:56.360 --> 36:58.359
... we know
it was someone else.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.839
And who do we...
think it was?

37:04.520 --> 37:06.399
Why, it was you, Milner.

37:06.480 --> 37:11.599
Are you suggesting that the British
security services assassinated Mr...

37:11.680 --> 37:13.999
Are we playing that game?

37:19.080 --> 37:22.559
If we did... kill Sykes...

37:23.560 --> 37:27.239
... what makes you think
we won't just kill you?

37:27.760 --> 37:30.159
I'm not Sykes, Milner.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.479
Or Letan.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.679
Or Rabbity,
or whatever your name is.

37:40.880 --> 37:45.079
Now, as you know,
there's a vote of no confidence...

37:45.160 --> 37:49.639
... in Mr. Callaghan and his government.
This Friday, in fact.

37:49.720 --> 37:53.159
If we win this vote,
there'll be a general election...

37:53.240 --> 37:56.359
... and Margaret will become Prime Minister.
Hooray.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.439
But it's balanced
on a knife edge.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.879
Alfred Broughton, Labour MP.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.439
He's at death's door, apparently.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.719
And you want us to push him
through that door?

38:07.800 --> 38:09.119
Heavens, no!

38:11.840 --> 38:15.159
If you did that,
the vote might get delayed.

38:15.240 --> 38:20.439
No, I just want you
to get him to pull a sickie.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.799
Mr. Carvel?

38:50.320 --> 38:53.919
- Who are you?
- Your friend Milner sent me.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.959
- She's rather upset with you.
- What do you want?

38:59.000 --> 39:03.559
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Mr. Omida.

39:04.960 --> 39:09.199
Should the time come,
I'm to be your daughter's torturer.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.039
I've been asked to explain
my process to you.

39:13.120 --> 39:17.639
Now, Jessica's only four,
and always the difficulty with such an age...

39:17.720 --> 39:20.679
... is maintaining life
for the maximum amount of time.

39:20.760 --> 39:24.239
So, I will need to monitor
vital signs throughout.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.719
But this is just a matter
of being attentive.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.679
Moo!

40:43.440 --> 40:45.439
Dr. Isherwood?

40:45.520 --> 40:48.759
What we're about to tell you
is a matter of national security.

40:48.840 --> 40:51.559
There is a threat
against one of your patients.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.399
An MP. Alfred Broughton.

40:54.480 --> 40:58.799
He will be assassinated
on his way to Westminster this Friday...

40:59.920 --> 41:02.799
- ... and we need you to stop him.
- Me?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.199
Tell him he's too sick to travel.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.519
What?
That won't stop him.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.599
- Christ, have you met him?
- Then make him too sick to travel.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.319
We can't go
to Broughton himself...

41:14.400 --> 41:17.839
... or we risk alerting those around him
who are setting this up.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.919
But, er...
what about the vote?

41:21.000 --> 41:25.039
I mean, it's a vote of no confidence.
Have you any idea how much that matters?

41:25.120 --> 41:30.399
Bernard Weatherill. He's a Tory MP.
There's a gentlemen's agreement...

41:30.480 --> 41:33.399
... that if a member of the Government
is too ill to vote...

41:33.480 --> 41:36.079
... then an opposition MP
also won't vote.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.919
We have persuaded Bernard
to honour that agreement.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.079
Bollocks.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.319
- Who do you think I am?
- Dr. Isherwood, this is...

41:47.400 --> 41:49.559
You're trying to topple
the fucking Government.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.919
No, no.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.479
I'm a Labour voter.
I'm a card-carrying member, you fucks!

41:55.560 --> 41:57.719
I've been on picket lines
up and down this country...

41:57.800 --> 42:00.839
... and I know an Ml5 stitch-up
when I see one. Martin!

42:00.920 --> 42:02.959
- Please don't do that.
- Martin!

42:03.040 --> 42:05.839
Fucking establishment crypto-fascist
bastards.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.999
You're all the same.
Terrified of the proletariat.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.839
- Martin, call the police.
- That's not a good idea.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.599
Tell them that it's a matter
of national security.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.199
- Martin, don't do that.
- There are two people here trying to...

42:25.400 --> 42:29.959
There.
Now, can we all just, please, calm down?

42:31.240 --> 42:34.519
Make sure
Alfred Broughton doesn't vote.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.479
Will you do that for us?

42:46.040 --> 42:48.119
Mr. Carvel?

42:50.640 --> 42:53.359
Philip? I am Omida.

42:56.360 --> 43:00.319
I need to know... I need to know
I can get through to you.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.279
Please nod.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.599
Good.

43:06.680 --> 43:09.399
Torture is communication.

43:09.480 --> 43:13.559
So, what I will do is, I will inflict
a torture upon your person.

43:13.640 --> 43:17.079
Then I'll go and inflict
the same torture upon Jessica.

43:17.160 --> 43:21.839
It will be exactly the same,
not diminished.

43:21.920 --> 43:26.159
What you feel, she will feel.
Exactly.

43:26.240 --> 43:30.279
You will imagine her screams.
Her tears.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.999
Please.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.359
- Her begging.
- Please don't do that.

43:34.440 --> 43:38.119
I will go back and forth this way
for a period of several hours...

43:38.200 --> 43:42.919
... and if that doesn't work,
then we'll start all over again...

43:43.000 --> 43:45.399
... but with her in front of you.

43:45.480 --> 43:52.759
Now, propriety requires me to ask you
if you'd simply like to give us Janus now.

43:52.840 --> 43:55.839
It's... perfect.

43:57.840 --> 44:01.799
But I've made a...
an adjustment to it.

44:01.880 --> 44:05.319
I've not been in control of myself,
you know?

44:05.400 --> 44:08.559
Well, we can work that out.
I promise.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.919
It... it's not...

44:14.960 --> 44:17.679
Tell us, Philip, please.

44:17.760 --> 44:20.239
Always,
with my first torture...

44:20.320 --> 44:24.519
... I like to start with something
brutal and traditional.

44:26.200 --> 44:30.879
I'm simply going to pull out
the fingernails on your right hand.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.239
Is it here?
Is it in the lab?

45:04.880 --> 45:07.199
Is this it?

45:07.280 --> 45:09.559
Is there something in this?

45:09.640 --> 45:13.039
I'm ashamed
of what I've done...

45:15.600 --> 45:17.959
... and I'm scared of you.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.879
You will use it
no matter what.

45:26.080 --> 45:29.039
Please don't hurt
my little girl.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.839
Oh, please!

45:33.920 --> 45:37.799
I'm going to visit Jessica now,
Mr. Carvel.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.759
Don't!

45:41.840 --> 45:43.679
Not Jessica!

45:43.760 --> 45:45.759
Did you call that in?

45:46.280 --> 45:48.119
Who the hell called that in?

45:52.920 --> 45:55.719
Let's go! Quick!
Move, move, move!

45:55.800 --> 45:58.599
Please evacuate
all areas immediately.

45:58.680 --> 46:01.999
- Evacuate all areas immediately...
- We need to evacuate this area now.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.079
Yes, I know,
but I need to get back there.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.159
Ma'am,
I will not tell you again!

46:07.240 --> 46:10.159
There is a nuclear incident
at the Three Mile Island plant.

46:10.240 --> 46:11.959
We must evacuate
this facility.

46:13.360 --> 46:16.199
Evacuate all areas
immediately.

46:16.280 --> 46:20.919
Please go to your designated assembly points,
where evac people are waiting.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.439
Do not stop...

46:23.920 --> 46:25.799
Philip Carvel?

46:26.720 --> 46:30.559
My name is Christos.
I've come to get you out of here.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.919
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.999
An accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.999
Federal agents said the reactor's core
may have been damaged.

48:40.080 --> 48:44.079
Radiation passed through the four-foot
concrete walls and was detected...

48:44.160 --> 48:45.959
... a mile away from the plant.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.039
Mr. Callaghan lost the vote
of no confidence by a single vote...

48:54.120 --> 48:57.239
... and has called a general election
for May 3rd.

48:57.320 --> 49:01.999
Favourite to become Europe's first woman
Prime Minister, Margaret Hilda Thatcher.

49:04.320 --> 49:07.599
The bomb went off
shortly before three o'clock.

49:07.680 --> 49:12.199
The bomb, in fact, had been placed
in Mr. Neave's blue Vauxhall car.

49:12.280 --> 49:16.919
Clearly, this was a deliberate and
well-planned operation. But by whom?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.879
When Mrs. Thatcher
was given the news by an aide...

49:19.960 --> 49:22.639
... nobody knew that the victim
was one of her closest friends.

49:22.720 --> 49:25.039
There's someone been killed.
A bomb outside the House of Commons.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.839
They need to talk to you.
Just now, seven minutes ago.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.879
- Who?
- We don't know yet.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.279
- Oh, dear...
- Terrible news, Mrs. Thatcher.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.159
We've lost him.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.879
Don't you mean
we've lost it?

49:54.440 --> 49:56.839
Isn't it Janus we've lost?

50:00.320 --> 50:03.639
I've just heard
that Airey Neave has been killed.

50:03.720 --> 50:06.599
An IRA bomb, they're saying.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.119
It was you.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.399
But... I don't understand.

50:16.480 --> 50:19.279
If...if we could do this all along,
why the hell did we do what he said?

50:19.360 --> 50:22.719
We need a government
that stays in power.

50:22.800 --> 50:25.759
I think this lot will be around
for a while...

50:25.840 --> 50:27.359
... with help.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.639
We've managed to pull some footage
of Carvel with Jessica...

50:35.720 --> 50:38.039
... from the
close-circuit system.

50:40.280 --> 50:43.359
We think that's a vaccine...

50:44.000 --> 50:46.879
... and we think
Janus is inside it.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.599
It's in her?

50:51.920 --> 50:54.239
He put it in Jessica?

50:56.840 --> 51:01.679
- And what's his name?
- His name's Dane. Mark Dane.

51:06.840 --> 51:11.239
- And does he have family?
- No. No, he hasn't got any family.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.399
Okay, Jessica Hyde...

51:43.440 --> 51:46.359
... let's teach you
how to use a gun.
