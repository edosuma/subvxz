(STUTTERS) 5056 or '57.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.508
<i>Oh, yeah! Huh. 5057!</i>

19:34.591 --> 19:36.969
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>I think that sets it up </i><i>pretty good.</i>

19:40.013 --> 19:44.184
All right, listen up!
Time for Operation Sneak-in-quietly.

19:44.268 --> 19:47.312
Once in, we disable
the mega muck hive brain

19:47.396 --> 19:49.106
and we're out. War over!

19:49.189 --> 19:53.527
I vote for the "storming the gates
guns ablazing take no prisoner" approach!

19:53.610 --> 19:55.737
Love your cocky hotshot spirit there, kid.

19:55.821 --> 19:59.241
But did you look outside? There's a whole
mess of mega muckers mucking about!

19:59.324 --> 20:01.869
(SCOFFS) The more, the messier.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.288
I've been where you're at,
Krieger. (GRUNTS)

20:04.371 --> 20:07.416
Listen, I love that "shoot first,
ask questions later," too

20:07.499 --> 20:09.793
I really do.
But you go out there like that

20:09.877 --> 20:12.713
we'd be mucked quicker
than a two-headed toad in September!

20:12.796 --> 20:15.382
TOM: He's right, kid.
And I should know.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.009
I was once one of them.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.636
Er... Half of one, at least!

20:19.720 --> 20:21.889
What the dang are you?

20:21.972 --> 20:25.642
Future-Worm, he's a reprogramed half-man,
half mega-muck.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.853
His name's Tom and he's on our side.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.980
(GRUNTS) I don't trust him.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.064
(SCREAMS)

20:31.148 --> 20:33.358
Hey, he's the one that got us
the palace blueprints.

20:33.442 --> 20:34.443
All right.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.778
But I got my visor on you.

20:36.862 --> 20:38.614
Back to that brilliant plan of mine!

20:38.697 --> 20:39.990
Nuts to the plan!

20:40.073 --> 20:41.867
-(SCREAMS)
-Krieger, no!

20:41.950 --> 20:44.661
(YELLING)

20:44.745 --> 20:47.706
-Krieger!
-By Pluto's moons. Let him go, Fyootch!

20:47.789 --> 20:49.166
We can't lose you, too.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.627
Carzy hotshot kid.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.087
Maybe he's got a chance, I don't know.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.714
(YELLING)

20:55.797 --> 20:57.174
-(ALL GASP)
-(GRUNTS)

20:57.257 --> 20:59.301
No! No! No!

21:00.135 --> 21:02.012
-Krieger!
-Help me!

21:02.095 --> 21:05.224
Help me, Future-Worm!

21:08.185 --> 21:10.521
Hey! I know everyone's
bummed out right now.

21:10.604 --> 21:13.065
But do me a favor.
Look up into the heavens.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.441
See that?

21:14.525 --> 21:15.692
A shooting star!

21:15.776 --> 21:17.236
It's actually not a star

21:17.319 --> 21:19.655
but a small rapidly moving meteor.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.949
Burning up as it enters
Earth's atmosphere.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.284
Can we still make a wish?

21:24.368 --> 21:26.453
What would Lou Kreiger want?

21:27.663 --> 21:32.417
Once again, thanks,
NDT for inspiring the team! (SPITS)

21:32.501 --> 21:34.294
Now let's go save Private Krieger!

21:34.378 --> 21:35.754
(ALL YELLING)
