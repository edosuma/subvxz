three balls, one try,
come on, come on there,

00:23.120 --> 00:25.080
you look like you've got
a good right arm on you,

00:25.160 --> 00:26.080
there we go.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.120
Roll up, roll up!

Hello, hello, excuse me?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.320
Have you come to
work on the buses?

02:25.400 --> 02:28.200
No, I'm on secondment to
the Metropolitan Police.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.280
Although I had no idea

02:30.360 --> 02:32.720
these parts of London
were quite so green.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.240
May I trouble you for
directions to Scotland Yard?

02:35.320 --> 02:38.160
Turn left at the
end of Lepers Lane,

02:38.240 --> 02:41.880
then keep walking
for about 98 miles.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.760
[moped horn beeps]

02:48.240 --> 02:50.400
Detective Sergeant
Livingstone, I presume?

02:50.480 --> 02:51.960
Sister Boniface,
at your service.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.360
Inspector's at a murder scene,

02:54.440 --> 02:57.160
so I'll fill you in
on the way, hop in!

02:57.240 --> 02:59.760
[bright music]

03:10.640 --> 03:12.120
[moped horn beeps]

03:12.200 --> 03:17.040
-Get out the way!
-[moped horn beeps]

03:20.160 --> 03:23.240
Rotten timing, the
Mangold Worzel Festival.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.080
World and his wife trampling
all over the crime scene.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.640
Mangold Worzel?

03:27.720 --> 03:28.840
Yes.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.720
Imagine, if you will,

03:30.800 --> 03:34.840
a large and rather
bad-tempered parsnip.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.200
So Uncle Tom Cobley was
trying to knock the head

03:37.280 --> 03:38.920
off old Aunt Sally.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.480
Why? What has she done?

03:40.560 --> 03:43.000
Oh, it's a local tradition.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
Jolly good fun too.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.880
Until someone bulls-eyed the
head and out dropped a corpse.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.720
Okay, thank you, sister,

03:50.800 --> 03:52.480
I can, I can take it from here.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.200
Grace Pearson, 23,
worked as a housemaid,

03:58.280 --> 04:00.280
Bellamy Hall, purse
in her coat pocket,

04:00.360 --> 04:02.920
a shopping list, library
ticket and 10 bob.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.240
So what do you think?

04:04.320 --> 04:07.000
Well, I think we can
rule out robbery.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.240
Ah, Sam Gillespie,
you must be Fred...

04:12.800 --> 04:14.120
Felix.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.920
Detective Sergeant
Felix Livingstone

04:16.000 --> 04:17.760
from Hamilton, Barbados.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.560
Hamilton, Bermuda, although
there's been a mix-up.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.120
I have been, in fact,
seconded to Scotland Yard.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.480
Ah, typical Met.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.960
They know their arses
from their elbows,

04:26.040 --> 04:27.560
if you'll pardon the
language, sister.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.160
Oh, pardon granted, Sam.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.920
I am predisposed to forgive.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.920
Just put them on, unless
you want a lecture.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.800
So, could you narrow
down time of death?

04:38.560 --> 04:40.920
Well, given it's
a melter of a day,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.160
I'd say no more than two hours.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.640
[camera clicks]

04:45.720 --> 04:47.200
What's under there?

04:49.280 --> 04:51.040
Oh, that is interesting.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.080
Look at that, cadaveric spasm.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.480
It's a rare form of
muscular stiffening

04:55.560 --> 04:57.800
associated with violent demise.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.120
Anything, I don't know,

04:59.200 --> 05:01.480
like cause of death
or murder weapon?

05:01.560 --> 05:02.880
[camera clicks]

05:02.960 --> 05:05.400
Petechiae in the eyes
suggests asphyxiation.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.240
Let's have a look in her mouth.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.920
[intriguing music]

05:10.000 --> 05:10.760
Ooh gosh.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.760
Dear lord.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.600
What's that?

05:17.040 --> 05:18.400
Hang on a minute.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.240
And, your murder
weapon identified.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.320
[camera clicking]

05:31.400 --> 05:33.520
Imagine the scene, if you will.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.160
The murderer holds her down,

05:35.240 --> 05:36.760
so when she opens
her mouth to scream,

05:36.840 --> 05:38.760
her airways fill with sawdust.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.160
A slow and terrifying death.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.080
-[Felix coughs]
-Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.

05:44.160 --> 05:44.960
Are you all right?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.640
[Felix chokes]

05:46.720 --> 05:48.240
I think you got a little
bit in your mouth, there.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.320
DS Felix Livingstone,
this is WPC Peggy Button.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.040
Finest WPC in the county.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.600
I'm the only WPC and the county.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.280
Oh, sir, you might want
to take a statement

05:57.360 --> 05:58.800
from Miss Thimble.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.720
I thought it might
be a lovers' tiff.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.760
I was walking past, and
I heard someone say,

06:04.840 --> 06:06.600
"You're a parasite."

06:06.680 --> 06:07.800
It did seem a little odd.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.200
You're a parasite,
her exact words?

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
If you say so, dear.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.640
A mummer, eh?

06:13.720 --> 06:14.920
So you didn't get
a look at his face?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.080
A mummer?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.760
The blokes dressed as haystacks.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.080
Could you manage a stab
at the time, Miss Thimble?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.240
Oh yes, it was tea time.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.080
Perhaps in terms of an
approximate chronological time?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.800
It was 1:13 and 17 seconds.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.880
Ah, that's very proximate.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.760
The church clock had just
struck the quarter hour,

06:36.840 --> 06:39.720
and is 1 minute 43 seconds fast.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.480
We're fundraising
to have it reset.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.800
-[change rattles]
-[gentle music]

06:44.880 --> 06:45.680
Right.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.440
Thank you.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.480
Ar, pick up our ol' Aunt Sally

06:52.560 --> 06:55.240
at the ol' dipper ar' two ack.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.000
You getting this down?

06:57.080 --> 06:59.920
I don't speak, Welsh?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.480
[Tom speaks in foreign language]

07:01.560 --> 07:02.480
[Tom laughs]

07:02.560 --> 07:03.600
There's no flies on you, Tom.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.640
He's from Barbados.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.520
-Bermuda.
-Bermuda.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.720
I am from Bermuda.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.880
[Tom speaks in foreign language]

07:14.760 --> 07:15.840
We will, Tom.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.400
The Mountie always gets his man.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.760
It's the local dialect,
you'll get used to it.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.120
I am not planning
on staying here.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.360
Translation, Tom
picked up Aunt Sally

07:25.440 --> 07:28.000
from the Lucky Dip
tent at 2:00 PM,

07:28.080 --> 07:30.560
failing to notice there
was a body inside.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.840
Now, Miss Thimble saw Grace
arguing with a mummer at-

07:33.920 --> 07:35.840
1:13 and 17 seconds.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.520
Which gives us a
murder window of-

07:37.600 --> 07:39.960
46 minutes and 43 seconds.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.520
So, where to next?

07:42.800 --> 07:43.720
Bellamy Hall.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.280
[bright music]

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
So Halcroft Bellamy
of Bellamy Steelworks

07:48.440 --> 07:49.640
died six months ago,

07:49.720 --> 07:51.200
leaving the lot to
his nephews and niece,

07:51.280 --> 07:53.120
Edwin, Fabian and Electra.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.320
Does Grace have any
family we can contact?

08:16.840 --> 08:17.840
She was an orphan.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.480
We had that in common,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.160
except while she was
raised in an orphanage,

08:24.240 --> 08:26.160
we were sent here to my uncle.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.560
Well, you were very fortunate.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.800
A witness mentioned
a lovers' tiff,

08:30.880 --> 08:33.560
did Grace have a young man?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.520
I very much doubt it.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.160
Electra fill her head with all
sorts of feministic fancies.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.600
Women should be
independent of men

08:40.680 --> 08:42.520
and have careers,
that sort of nonsense.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.200
I see you are a mummer.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.200
Oh, yes, we both were.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.960
For our sins, it's
expected of us Bellamys.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.760
He means male Bellamys.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.560
I take it you disapprove?

08:56.640 --> 08:57.920
Of the menfolk prancing around

08:58.000 --> 08:59.640
while their
womenfolk serve food?

08:59.720 --> 09:00.600
[Sam chuckles]

09:00.680 --> 09:01.880
Have you tried prancing around

09:01.960 --> 09:03.760
dressed as a haystack
in 70 degree heat?

09:03.840 --> 09:06.520
Right, well, do you
mind if Sister Boniface

09:06.600 --> 09:08.840
takes a look around
Grace's bedroom?

09:08.920 --> 09:11.000
Who the blazes is
Sister Boniface?

09:11.080 --> 09:14.040
[bright music]

09:14.120 --> 09:16.760
[camera clicking]

09:16.840 --> 09:18.440
Police scientific advisor.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.480
I admire a woman with a career.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.120
My uncle believed that men
were created to serve God

09:30.200 --> 09:32.240
and women to serve men.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.840
[camera clicking]

09:33.920 --> 09:35.280
Two careers.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.200
Actually three, if
you count wine-making.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.320
"To Grace, with love Electra.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.080
The mind is not a
vessel to be filled,

09:44.160 --> 09:45.360
but a fire to be kindled."

09:45.440 --> 09:46.800
You were teaching her to read?

09:48.520 --> 09:49.880
All she ever wanted
was to escape

09:49.960 --> 09:52.440
a life of domestic servitude.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.360
We were alike in that respect.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.960
She wasn't just,

09:58.680 --> 09:59.600
we were friends.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.680
For years, my only friend,

10:04.080 --> 10:06.560
I don't know what I'll
do without her. [sobs]

10:06.640 --> 10:07.440
Oh!

10:10.360 --> 10:11.840
Here.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.120
Thank you. [sniffs]

10:18.360 --> 10:20.520
[clock chiming]

10:20.600 --> 10:23.280
[peaceful music]

10:29.000 --> 10:30.800
[Felix] I thought we're
meeting at a laboratory.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.240
Ah, ye of little faith.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.440
[bottles clinking]

10:34.520 --> 10:36.360
Evening, Reg.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.600
Oi, you're paying for that!

10:38.680 --> 10:41.000
Nuns, making alcohol?

10:41.080 --> 10:43.760
Our lord asked for poverty,
chastity and obedience.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.320
Didn't say anything
about sobriety.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.360
Amen to that.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.800
[curious music]

10:48.880 --> 10:51.600
[liquid bubbling]

10:55.880 --> 10:58.200
Did her room turn up anything?

10:58.280 --> 11:01.720
Fact, all library users
are issued four tickets.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.160
One was found in her purse,

11:03.240 --> 11:05.200
deduction, Grace
borrowed three books,

11:05.280 --> 11:06.920
two in her room and
the third is missing.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.840
However, it's clear from the
dust patterns on the bookshelf,

11:08.920 --> 11:10.960
it was there no later
than this morning.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.360
Stick with it, there will
be a point eventually.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.960
Now Grace was a spit
spot sort of a girl,

11:15.040 --> 11:16.520
everything in its place.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.400
So she wouldn't mislay a
library book and risk a fine.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.720
Is any of this significant?

11:20.800 --> 11:22.200
Well, sometimes the
absence of something

11:22.280 --> 11:24.480
is as significant
as its presence.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.280
Right, we'll check
with the library,

11:26.360 --> 11:28.200
and we need to do
a background check

11:28.280 --> 11:30.480
on the Bellamy brothers.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.640
Till then, I say
we call it a night.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.520
I haven't been in contact
with Scotland Yard yet.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.080
Oh it's too late now,

11:38.160 --> 11:39.520
and the hotels will all be
closed for the Worzel Festival.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.920
Nothing for it but
to throw yourself

11:41.000 --> 11:42.280
at the mercy of my landlady.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.400
Will she have a room?

11:44.480 --> 11:45.920
Well, I'm her only lodger

11:46.000 --> 11:47.800
and they're not exactly
battering down the doors

11:47.880 --> 11:50.200
in account of Mrs. Clam being,

11:50.280 --> 11:51.800
well, Mrs. Clam is, er,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.840
let's just say Mrs. Clam is-

11:54.920 --> 11:58.480
No alcohol, no helping
yourself to food or drink

11:58.560 --> 12:01.360
from the kitchen, no laundry,

12:01.440 --> 12:06.200
no radios or telephone calls
after 9:00 PM and no women.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.400
I know what you
policemen are like.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.680
Well, I am engaged
to be married.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.760
Oh, congratulations.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.000
Who's the lucky girl?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.000
Victoria.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.720
[sniffs] Two guineas a week.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.000
Oh, I'm not planning on staying-

12:19.080 --> 12:21.280
Breakfast and evening
meal are provided.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.160
And I hope you're not
expecting any foreign food.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.480
[intriguing music]

12:27.560 --> 12:30.360
[Felix sighs]

12:30.440 --> 12:33.840
[footsteps approach]

12:33.920 --> 12:36.120
What are you doing
up at this hour?

12:36.200 --> 12:38.720
Reverend Mother
Adrian, just reading.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.520
Sister Peter takes it for
her knitting patterns,

12:40.600 --> 12:41.880
so it was in her work basket,

12:41.960 --> 12:43.520
and removing it seemed
perilously close

12:43.600 --> 12:44.800
to breaking the eighth, so-

12:44.880 --> 12:47.880
You aren't, from memory,
much of a knitter?

12:47.960 --> 12:50.880
No, but it has some
interesting articles.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.560
"How to keep your
husband honeymoon happy."

12:56.640 --> 12:59.320
Have you something
to confess, sister?

12:59.400 --> 13:01.840
Oh! [laughs]

13:01.920 --> 13:03.400
Very good, no, no-

13:03.480 --> 13:05.440
I'll spare you from
breaking the ninth

13:05.520 --> 13:10.280
and assume it's to do with your
extracurricular activities.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.960
Though why the Mother House
allow it is a mystery.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.680
Make sure you turn the
lights off when you go.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.320
[bright music]

13:31.080 --> 13:31.880
Bingo!

13:35.840 --> 13:38.040
[flame hissing]

13:38.120 --> 13:39.400
Now we know Grace
called in at the shop

13:39.480 --> 13:40.960
on her way to the fair.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.840
Fact, there are seven
items on the shopping list,

13:43.920 --> 13:46.240
all of which were in her
shopping basket, except for one,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.320
a copy of this week's
"Albion Home Maker."

13:48.400 --> 13:50.240
Begging the question,
did the murderer take it,

13:50.320 --> 13:52.160
and if so, for what reason?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.160
I've got a feeling
you're going to tell me.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.920
"Mrs. Arnold's Advice."

13:59.000 --> 14:00.800
"My fiance won't go
to church on Sundays,

14:00.880 --> 14:02.240
should I call off the wedding?"

14:02.320 --> 14:03.480
Almost certainly yes.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.440
You would say that.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.800
Well, Mrs. Arnold concurs, look.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.680
"If he's lazy in this instance,

14:08.760 --> 14:11.600
it bodes ill for his character."

14:11.680 --> 14:13.200
My lack of desire
to go to church

14:13.280 --> 14:15.280
is only outweighed by my lack
of desire to find a wife,

14:15.360 --> 14:16.520
-so if you would just-
-Yes, well anyway,

14:16.600 --> 14:18.560
if you look at the
bottom of the page here.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.840
G-P, Grace Pearson.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.760
"I advise you to
go to the police."

14:24.440 --> 14:26.280
I think we need to have a
word with this Mrs. Arnold.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.360
[bright music]

14:28.440 --> 14:29.240
Oh, yes.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.040
[phone ringing]

14:39.120 --> 14:39.760
Am I to assume this is
to do with Grace Pearson?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.360
No comment.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.480
I'm not really feeling the
quid pro quo here, Sam.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.520
She was 23 years old and
her life was taken brutally,

14:50.600 --> 14:51.960
and in the cruellest of ways.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.440
Thank you, sister.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.280
See, you only had to ask nicely.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.720
Mrs. Arnold, the
coppers wanna word.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.520
Come on.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.840
[bright music]

15:04.920 --> 15:06.440
"Dear Mrs. Arnold,

15:06.520 --> 15:09.440
my employer died recently
due to natural causes.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.240
I now suspect it was a
murder, but I have no proof.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.640
Should I tell someone?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.920
Please don't print
this letter, G.P."

15:18.120 --> 15:19.360
No one thought to hand this in?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.320
Well, it's called "Mrs.
Arnold's Advice," Sam,

15:21.400 --> 15:23.280
not Mrs. Arnold
snitches to the police.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.720
[laughs] Yes, very good.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.520
Halcroft Bellamy's obituary.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.280
Took some wordsmanship,
I can tell you,

15:29.360 --> 15:30.840
as his demise was a
blessing to us all.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.320
Rich as Croesus, but
mean as Mephistopheles.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.680
Cause of death?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.360
A heart attack at
his birthday dinner.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.000
Any suspicious circumstances?

15:38.080 --> 15:39.760
Well, Chief Constable Lowsley
obviously didn't think so,

15:39.840 --> 15:41.640
he was one of the guests.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.040
Look, Sam, if anything
comes of this,

15:44.120 --> 15:45.520
and the nationals
get hold of it first,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.400
I will make your
life a living hell.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.880
And if there is so
much as a word of this

15:48.960 --> 15:49.920
in your evening edition,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.240
I will return the favour.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.640
[curious music]

15:54.720 --> 15:58.200
[typewriter keys clacking]

15:59.720 --> 16:02.400
[crowd chattering]

16:02.480 --> 16:04.040
[crowd applauding]

16:04.120 --> 16:07.320
Well done, lad, show 'em
what coppers are made of!

16:07.400 --> 16:12.240
[laughs] Anyway, it
was a ghastly affair.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.160
He made us eat invalid food.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.720
I don't know what he
spent his millions on,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.480
but it certainly
wasn't his wine cellar.

16:20.560 --> 16:25.320
Anyway, the interminable meal
was finally coming to an end

16:27.000 --> 16:29.240
when young Master Bellamy
rose to propose a toast.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.320
[glass clinks]

16:32.400 --> 16:36.760
I'd like to raise a glass in
toast, happy birthday uncle,

16:36.840 --> 16:38.920
and good health
for years to come.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.560
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, Bellamy.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.560
[Halcroft choking]

16:42.640 --> 16:45.720
[ominous music]

16:45.800 --> 16:47.360
[vegetable splatting]

16:47.440 --> 16:50.360
Keep your elbow level with
your throwing shoulder!

16:50.440 --> 16:51.240
Buffoon.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.640
Anyway, his nurse was
with him in minutes,

16:54.720 --> 16:57.760
said his ulcer had burst and
brought on a heart attack.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.120
Did anything strike
you as suspicious?

17:00.200 --> 17:03.520
Ah, unpleasant old
man dies suddenly

17:03.600 --> 17:05.160
and makes his nephews and niece

17:05.240 --> 17:07.480
rich beyond their
wildest dreams?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.840
That sort of thing, sir.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.440
[chuckles] Occam's
Razor, Gillespie.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.560
He was in poor health.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.040
Poison wasn't an option
as we'd all ate and drank

17:17.120 --> 17:17.960
the same things.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.320
[whistle blowing]

17:20.400 --> 17:21.680
Action stations.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.160
Er, if you want to
speak to the nurse,

17:23.240 --> 17:24.600
she's manning the
first aid tent.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.160
Libby, er, Libby Libby
Libby, Libby Mayfield.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.560
I went to the library.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.120
Grace's missing book was
Plutarch's "Parallel Lives."

17:33.200 --> 17:35.280
Heavy reading for a housemaid.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.800
Don't say I told you so.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.240
I withdrew the only other copy

17:38.320 --> 17:39.880
in the library, unfortunately-

17:39.960 --> 17:41.320
How's your Ancient Greek?

17:41.400 --> 17:43.120
Decidedly rusty.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.840
She's just being modest.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.160
I need to have a word
with the chief constable.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.760
Excuse me, thank you.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.800
Ah, you must be the new boy.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.880
Chief Constable Hector Lowsley.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.480
Detective Sergeant Livingstone.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.360
Sir, there seems to
have been a mistake.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.640
I should be at Scotland Yard.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.200
Well, that's a
grave one, ballcock!

18:06.280 --> 18:07.880
Someone will be
held accountable.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.840
Devil knows who.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.280
So how are you finding
England's green and pleasant?

18:15.120 --> 18:16.880
A bit of a culture shock, sir.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.320
Sister Boniface?

18:20.400 --> 18:24.280
I know exactly what
you're thinking.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.640
Waste of a brain.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.600
Double starred first
from Cambridge,

18:29.680 --> 18:34.080
PhD in Biochemical,
thingummy, Science.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.280
Which came in jolly useful
during the war, I can tell you.

18:37.360 --> 18:42.040
Yes, MI5 wanted her after, but
she decided to take the veil.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.680
[laughs] Ah, women.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.200
Still, the spooks'
loss was our gain.

18:48.280 --> 18:51.120
[whistle blowing]

18:51.200 --> 18:53.680
Aye aye, let battle commence!

18:57.480 --> 18:59.640
[crowd cheering]

18:59.720 --> 19:01.160
With luck and
careful management,

19:01.240 --> 19:02.800
he could've lived years.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.320
Sadly, luck wasn't on his side.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.440
And you diagnosed
a heart attack?

19:08.520 --> 19:10.680
The sudden and violent
onset of symptoms

19:10.760 --> 19:12.480
were consistent with
a cardiac arrest

19:12.560 --> 19:14.680
brought on by a
burst gastric ulcer.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.600
Abdominal pains,
convulsions, hematemesis.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.360
The doctor who attended later
concurred with my diagnosis.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.040
What was Bellamy
like as an employer?

19:24.120 --> 19:27.080
Cruel, selfish and irascible.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.760
Which begs the question,
why did you stay?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.400
He paid well.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.680
Excuse me, first Mangold
injury of the year.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.480
Come this way, thank you.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.840
Spit it out.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.560
Fact, Grace suspected

19:41.640 --> 19:43.200
Halcroft Bellamy's
death was unnatural,

19:43.280 --> 19:45.240
and fact, the
symptoms described,

19:45.320 --> 19:47.240
abdominal pains,
convulsions, hematemesis,

19:47.320 --> 19:50.040
are also consistent
with cyanide poisoning.

19:50.120 --> 19:50.920
[ominous music]

19:51.000 --> 19:53.600
[Sam] Cyanide poisoning.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.200
Query means, as all the guests

20:00.280 --> 20:02.240
shared the same food and drink.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.080
I'm still waiting on
criminal record reports.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.200
Edwin, 27, Fabian,
24, both single,

20:08.280 --> 20:10.080
both employed by
the family firm.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.760
Dutiful enough nephews
by all accounts,

20:11.840 --> 20:14.320
although Fabian had a spot
of trouble at university

20:14.400 --> 20:17.120
and was sent down on
a disciplinary matter.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.640
Electra lived at home
until her uncle's death,

20:19.720 --> 20:21.240
schooled by a governess
until she was old enough

20:21.320 --> 20:23.240
to act as her uncle's companion.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.680
Now reads Classics at
Girton College, Cambridge,

20:25.760 --> 20:28.160
where she is president
of the Feminist Society.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.280
Oh, bravo.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.800
Also, Halcroft Bellamy
reported the theft

20:32.880 --> 20:35.000
of a pair of Queen
Anne candlesticks.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.600
The complaint was withdrawn,

20:36.680 --> 20:41.400
but here is the crime
file from WPC Button.

20:43.200 --> 20:43.960
Good work.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.880
Anything from you, sister?

20:46.960 --> 20:49.080
Post-mortem lividity.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.720
So, when the heart
stops beating, blood
pools in the body,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.120
in this case,
leaving the imprint

20:54.200 --> 20:56.720
of an object clutched
in her hand at death.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.360
Nothing found on the body
or at the crime scene,

20:58.440 --> 21:01.200
but maybe it was
removed by the killer.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.920
I'll have to magnify
the photograph and
get a clearer image.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.360
So Grace confides
in Mrs. Arnold,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.160
and on the day it's
printed in the magazine,

21:09.240 --> 21:10.800
she gets murdered.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.080
The same day the Bellamy
brothers were at the fair

21:13.160 --> 21:14.680
dressed as mummers.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.000
We need to talk to
the Bellamys again.

21:16.080 --> 21:16.880
Yeah.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.800
Any luck with Scotland Yard?

21:21.520 --> 21:22.720
I'm still trying to track
down the relevant officer

21:22.800 --> 21:24.320
to speak to.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.960
Well, we've got this, if
you need to make some calls.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.280
Are you ready, sister?

21:28.360 --> 21:30.040
Oh, Roger Wilco, sir.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.600
[ominous music]

21:35.680 --> 21:37.520
She never did grasp I before E.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.920
Well, utter rot.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.440
Of course uncle Hal
wasn't murdered.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.080
We'd be pretty lousy murderers

21:43.160 --> 21:45.920
to bump him off in front of
the chief constable of police.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.840
I believe all the
guests ate and drank

21:47.920 --> 21:49.440
the same that night?

21:49.520 --> 21:51.120
Broth and boiled chicken.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.600
The only other thing he
ate was half a peach,

21:55.680 --> 21:57.200
same dessert every night.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.080
And before you ask, it wasn't
poisoned because as always,

22:02.160 --> 22:03.360
I ate the other half.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.760
My uncle abhorred food wastage.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.080
Now, you both took part
in the parade yesterday?

22:10.160 --> 22:11.840
Oh, this is intolerable.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.520
First, you accuse us
of murdering our uncle,

22:13.600 --> 22:14.760
and now our maid.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.080
Not at all, sir.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.240
But Grace was last seen
alive with a mummer,

22:18.320 --> 22:20.120
and there was over
30 in the procession,

22:20.200 --> 22:22.960
and I'm duty bound to
follow up on every one.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.360
Of course, Inspector,
whatever we can do to help.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.960
[curious music]

22:33.760 --> 22:35.760
Although Dr. Locard
maintains the perpetrator

22:35.840 --> 22:37.280
brings something
to the crime scene

22:37.360 --> 22:38.880
and leaves with
something from it,

22:40.280 --> 22:43.040
I doubt he was ever
faced with one of these.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.400
Literally like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

22:47.680 --> 22:51.160
[suspenseful music]

22:51.240 --> 22:52.000
Strange.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.280
Can you confirm that these
belong to your uncle?

22:56.360 --> 22:58.440
Possibly, why do you ask?

22:58.520 --> 23:00.160
Well, considering he's
been dead for six months,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.600
we were wondering who
wore them yesterday?

23:02.680 --> 23:05.320
Yes, all three pairs have
fresh grass and mud stains,

23:05.400 --> 23:07.800
and the legs on this
pair have been trimmed

23:07.880 --> 23:09.960
with a sharp blade for a wearer

23:10.040 --> 23:14.080
of approximately five foot
four and three quarter inches.

23:15.640 --> 23:20.480
[chuckles] Oh, you
sly old dog. [laughs]

23:21.280 --> 23:23.760
Yes, all right.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.320
I wore them to the
parade, so arrest me.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.920
What the hell were you thinking?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.240
If you'd been found out,

23:29.320 --> 23:30.920
all merry hell would
have broken loose.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.280
Why did you lie, Miss Bellamy?

23:33.360 --> 23:36.800
The inevitable lecture
from my brother, obviously.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.960
It was a symbolic
act of rebellion.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.920
[Fabian laughs]

23:41.000 --> 23:42.840
Proving that with
gender concealed,

23:42.920 --> 23:45.240
there is no distinction
between sexes.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.120
Our sister doesn't conform
to traditional female roles.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.520
Put a sock in it, Fabe.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.760
-Look, enough!
-[Fabian laughs]

23:51.840 --> 23:52.880
Is that all, Inspector?

23:54.120 --> 23:55.800
Yes, for now.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.320
We know where to find you
if there's anything further.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.400
Symbolic act of rebellion.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.800
[Electra sighs]

24:09.880 --> 24:11.520
God.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.280
Now, something tells me
you're going to like this.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.440
Almost there, bear with me.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.840
Oh, and, voila!

24:20.640 --> 24:21.640
[Sam] Is that an F?

24:23.720 --> 24:26.720
I would say possibly an item
of jewellery or cuff links.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.440
I think it's time I
brought Fabian Bellamy

24:28.520 --> 24:29.720
in for questioning.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.240
And I'm late for an
optician's appointment.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.120
[melancholy music]

24:44.920 --> 24:46.320
Just before he died,

24:46.400 --> 24:47.760
your uncle reported the theft

24:47.840 --> 24:50.080
of two Queen Anne candlesticks.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.320
He claimed that they were taken

24:51.400 --> 24:52.760
by a member of the household.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.400
Did he know about your arrest

24:55.480 --> 24:57.280
for the possession
of illegal drugs?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.280
Hm, what do you think?

25:00.640 --> 25:02.000
I think you would have
been out on your ear

25:02.080 --> 25:03.560
without any inheritance.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.600
And then the candlesticks
mysteriously turned up.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.600
I owed money to
the wrong people.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.200
So yes, I resorted to
stealing the family silver.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.000
Didn't think he'd notice
the odd candlestick,

25:17.080 --> 25:19.240
but when he went to the
police, I panicked, and-

25:19.320 --> 25:20.560
And you killed him.

25:20.640 --> 25:25.080
[laughs] No, no, I
fessed up to Edwin,

25:25.160 --> 25:27.680
and on certain conditions,
he saved my skin.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.040
Got the candlesticks
out of hock.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.080
What conditions?

25:32.120 --> 25:34.720
Forced me to a drying out
clinic for dope addicts.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.880
Much as I cursed
him at the time,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.120
I am what you see
before you now,

25:38.200 --> 25:41.440
a sober and responsible
member of society.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.440
Don't judge me, Inspector.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.600
Our childhood ended
when our parents died

25:47.680 --> 25:50.200
and we were sent to live with
a man who hated children.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.480
Edwin coped by playing
possum, towing the line,

25:55.560 --> 25:57.760
being groomed for
the family firm,

25:57.840 --> 26:00.720
forbidden to marry because
uncle didn't approve.

26:00.800 --> 26:05.080
Electra, well, Electra
buried herself in books.

26:06.360 --> 26:11.240
Whereas I chose sweet oblivion,

26:13.600 --> 26:18.360
to fade far away,
dissolve and quite forget.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.280
You said your brother
was forbidden to marry.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.600
[melancholy music]

26:28.680 --> 26:30.760
[Fabian chuckles]

26:30.840 --> 26:35.760
E-F-A-T-H-O.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.800
[lens clinks]

26:46.000 --> 26:47.080
And now?

26:49.760 --> 26:54.680
F-E-A-T-H-O, oh!

26:58.200 --> 27:00.560
My trip to the optician was
successful on two levels,

27:00.640 --> 27:01.960
prescription
woefully out of date,

27:02.040 --> 27:05.400
and a Damascene moment
with a Snellen chart.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.240
So under closer magnification,
there's a striation, you see?

27:08.320 --> 27:09.160
Look, just here.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.000
This isn't an F, it's an E.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.720
Electra or Edwin.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.360
Funny you should say that,

27:17.440 --> 27:19.040
'cause Fabian
Bellamy just coughed

27:19.120 --> 27:21.440
that his brother Edwin fell in
love with his uncle's nurse.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.760
When his uncle found out,

27:22.840 --> 27:24.240
he hit the roof and
banned the match.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.320
The $64,000 question is

27:26.400 --> 27:27.640
why you didn't think to mention

27:27.720 --> 27:29.520
that Edwin Bellamy
was your fiance?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.720
I didn't think it relevant.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.240
Halcroft's death left him
free to marry who he choose,

27:35.320 --> 27:37.640
without any risk
to his inheritance.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.280
A death that you diagnosed
as natural causes,

27:40.360 --> 27:42.120
but also indicated
cyanide poisoning,

27:43.520 --> 27:45.600
as any good nurse
would have known.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.320
Halcroft Bellamy was a monster

27:48.400 --> 27:51.480
who treated those children
like his playthings.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.640
Is it any wonder that they
are all scarred mentally

27:53.720 --> 27:55.760
or that if I had suspicions,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.640
that's the reason I
kept them to myself?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.960
But it wasn't Edwin, I
can assure you of that.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.320
How so?

28:02.400 --> 28:04.040
Because if he isn't
brave enough to stand up

28:04.120 --> 28:06.280
for the woman he loves,

28:06.360 --> 28:08.600
then he'd hardly be brave
enough to kill for me.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.880
Can I ask where you
were two days ago

28:10.960 --> 28:12.120
between 1:00 and 2:00 PM?

28:13.160 --> 28:14.440
Here, on duty.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.240
And before you ask, no,

28:18.320 --> 28:20.560
I did not see any
patients during that time,

28:20.640 --> 28:22.520
so if there's nothing else,

28:22.600 --> 28:24.360
the Mangold final
starts in five minutes

28:24.440 --> 28:27.280
and I'm expecting a rush
of blunt force traumas.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.480
Can we have your full name
for our records, please?

28:29.560 --> 28:30.760
Elizabeth Joan Mayfield.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.040
[suspicious music]

28:40.240 --> 28:42.960
[crowd cheering]

28:44.760 --> 28:46.480
Hello, Button.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.040
From Scotland Yard, sergeant.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.000
Apologies for the error,

28:52.080 --> 28:54.480
report to DCI James,
Scotland Yard,

28:54.560 --> 28:56.760
at your earliest
convenience. [laughs]

28:56.840 --> 28:59.320
We were just getting used
to having you around.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.720
[bright music]

29:24.880 --> 29:26.120
[bright music swells]

29:26.200 --> 29:29.920
[bright music stops]

29:30.000 --> 29:32.440
[phone rings]

29:33.400 --> 29:34.320
Hello?

29:34.400 --> 29:36.080
It's all here in Plutarch.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.720
Miss Thimble misheard.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.840
Grace didn't say parasite,
she said Parysatis,

29:40.920 --> 29:43.400
a classical poisoner of some
ingenuity, it transpires.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.160
Wait, I need to write this down.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.040
Here, take this.

29:46.120 --> 29:46.880
No, I can't take it!

29:46.960 --> 29:49.000
[Sam sighs]

29:49.080 --> 29:50.400
Hello?

29:50.480 --> 29:51.240
Hello?

29:52.520 --> 29:54.680
Don't think about
calling back, you hussy!

29:55.600 --> 29:58.040
[phone slams]

30:01.160 --> 30:02.120
Right.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.560
So, this is what you get up to

30:04.640 --> 30:06.720
when I'm safely
asleep in my bed?

30:06.800 --> 30:09.960
Women telephoning at
the dead of night.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.960
It is barely gone past
nine, and I assure you,

30:13.040 --> 30:15.240
there is a perfectly
innocent explanation.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.920
That woman she's, she's a nun.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.480
I don't know what counts as
innocent where you come from,

30:21.560 --> 30:22.880
but in this country,

30:22.960 --> 30:25.040
it is moral turpitude
of the highest order,

30:25.120 --> 30:27.280
and I will not have
it under my roof!

30:27.360 --> 30:28.440
Nor will you have to,

30:28.520 --> 30:29.760
for I shall be leaving tomorrow,

30:29.840 --> 30:31.720
for which I am
profoundly grateful.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.720
Great Slaughter should
be called Bedlam,

30:34.800 --> 30:36.880
as it is peopled with lunatics.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.400
How dare you?

30:38.480 --> 30:40.400
My bill shall be settled
before my departure.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.200
I bid you a good
night, Mrs. Clam.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.000
[Mrs. Clam sniffs]

30:43.080 --> 30:45.680
[phone jangles]

30:47.640 --> 30:49.840
[Felix sighs]

30:49.920 --> 30:51.680
Wait, the sister's
got something.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.440
Rendezvous at Bellamy
Hall in the morning.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.040
And you just do as she says?

30:55.120 --> 30:55.840
No, well.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.240
Somewhat annoyingly,
she is usually right.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.920
I came here to learn
from the cutting edge

31:02.000 --> 31:03.560
of modern policing.

31:03.640 --> 31:06.720
Your procedures and systems
are Victorian, at best,

31:06.800 --> 31:08.920
and your partnered with a nun.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.600
Exactly, no one can
resist a wimple,

31:10.680 --> 31:13.560
and we have the best
cleanup rate in the county.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.440
So, you on for a
collar before you go?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.640
The only thing I
should be on tomorrow,

31:18.720 --> 31:20.120
is the first train to London.

31:21.080 --> 31:21.840
Excuse me.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.400
[Sam sighs]

31:26.480 --> 31:28.280
[doorbell rings]

31:28.360 --> 31:31.720
[door creaks]

31:31.800 --> 31:35.040
DI Gillespie, I have a warrant
to search these premises.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.280
Then you better come in.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.960
[ominous music]

31:41.680 --> 31:43.600
So, Inspector, have
you and the sister

31:43.680 --> 31:45.240
finished rooting
through our valuables?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.800
[Sam sighs]

31:46.880 --> 31:48.560
This is all a bit
Agatha Christie.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.880
[Fabian and Edwin chuckle]

31:49.960 --> 31:51.600
Grace suspected that
your uncle's death

31:51.680 --> 31:53.400
was due to unnatural causes.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.560
When she raised those
suspicions, she was murdered.

31:55.640 --> 31:56.840
She was in illiterate housemaid

31:56.920 --> 31:58.680
with a head filled
with nonsense.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.080
Grace wasn't illiterate,
Electra had taught her to read.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.040
Shortly before she died,

32:03.120 --> 32:05.360
she was seen arguing
with a mummer.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.640
Now, the witness overheard
her call them a parasite.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.840
But what she actually
said was a Per, a Para-

32:12.080 --> 32:13.160
A Parysatis.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.440
Parysatis.

32:14.520 --> 32:18.080
And who's she, the
cat's mother? [chuckles]

32:18.160 --> 32:20.160
The wife of Emperor
Darius, of Persia,

32:20.240 --> 32:21.480
Who according to Plutarch,

32:21.560 --> 32:23.120
poisoned her rival at
a banquet of guests,

32:23.200 --> 32:24.480
all dining on the same food.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.760
Just, um-

32:26.840 --> 32:28.240
I don't read Ancient Greek.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.240
Oh right, right.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.120
I'm a bit rusty, so. [coughs]

32:34.200 --> 32:35.200
Just get on with it.

32:37.760 --> 32:41.280
"So taking a little bird,

32:41.360 --> 32:44.520
Parysatis halved it
with a little knife,

32:44.600 --> 32:47.520
smeared with poison on one side,

32:47.600 --> 32:52.360
thus wiping the poison off
upon one part only of the bird.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.080
The undefiled and
wholesome part,

32:56.160 --> 32:59.840
she then put into her
own mouth and ate.

32:59.920 --> 33:03.160
And to Stateira, she
gave the poisoned part,

33:03.240 --> 33:06.800
who died in convulsions
and great suffering."

33:06.880 --> 33:09.640
[Halcroft chokes]

33:12.240 --> 33:14.840
[Electra gasps]

33:16.200 --> 33:17.800
I'm afraid you've
lost me. [chuckles]

33:17.880 --> 33:21.240
Well every night, Electra
shared a peach with your uncle.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.960
Only this time, his
half was lethal.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.240
You taught Grace to read
rather too well, it seems.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.480
Preposterous.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.200
Not to mention unprovable.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.520
Not if we exhume the body

33:30.600 --> 33:31.840
and test it for
traces of cyanide.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.200
I've had enough of this.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.040
I'm gonna contact our solicitor.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.440
I believe you need burden
of proof to exhume a body.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.680
Reasonable suspicion will do it.

33:42.760 --> 33:44.840
But as you asked, sister?

33:44.920 --> 33:46.200
Oh yes,

33:46.280 --> 33:48.960
you left a signature
clutched in Grace's hand

33:49.040 --> 33:50.640
at the time of death,

33:50.720 --> 33:54.080
and though removed afterwards,
it had already left its mark.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.720
We found this in your room.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.400
I told her the wisdom of
the world was in Plutarch.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.320
I never imagined she'd
actually read it.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.320
[suspenseful music]

34:22.440 --> 34:24.040
"The Albion Home Maker"?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.600
Have I taught you
nothing, my dear?

34:26.680 --> 34:28.320
What're you doing, Electra?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.760
Playing the men
at their own game.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.120
What's so compelling in
Mrs. Arnold's Advice?

34:33.200 --> 34:33.960
Give it back.

34:34.920 --> 34:35.720
Electra!

34:40.240 --> 34:42.480
Why would you want to
go to the police, Grace?

34:44.440 --> 34:48.400
The wisdom of the world, you
said, contained in one book.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.280
I wanted to surprise you,

34:54.440 --> 34:57.800
but then I realised,
you are Parysatis.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.680
[Grace screams]

35:02.760 --> 35:05.440
[dramatic music]

35:19.440 --> 35:22.640
Grace was my only friend,

35:26.440 --> 35:28.480
but the summit of
her aspirations

35:28.560 --> 35:30.240
was a nice little office job

35:30.320 --> 35:32.280
where she wouldn't be
on her feet all day.

35:34.200 --> 35:38.400
Whereas I am destined to be
a someone of significance.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.320
Electra Bellamy, I am
arresting you for the murders

35:42.400 --> 35:44.720
of Halcroft Bellamy
and Grace Pearson.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.520
You do not need to say anything
but anything you do say-

35:46.600 --> 35:48.040
No, she doesn't.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.200
Take my car.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.400
There's, er, there's
money in there, and a gun.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.920
Be careful, it's loaded.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.520
Typical of you to leave it
till now to surprise me, Edwin.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.360
I tried my best.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.200
I'm just sorry,

36:10.040 --> 36:11.880
I'm sorry I wasn't good enough.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.800
[melancholy music]

36:27.720 --> 36:29.560
I'll shoot anyone who
tries to stop her.

36:31.640 --> 36:36.440
Right, well, as it looks
like we're in for a wait,

36:38.280 --> 36:40.720
is anyone up for
a rubber of Whist?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.120
Only if we're playing for money.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.640
[Sam sighs]

36:50.720 --> 36:53.760
[train whistle blows]

37:10.480 --> 37:11.960
Miss Bellamy.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.880
[Electra laughs]

37:13.960 --> 37:14.800
May I?

37:14.880 --> 37:17.520
[ominous music]

37:26.160 --> 37:27.560
[whistle blows]

37:27.640 --> 37:30.720
[train whistle blows]

37:36.360 --> 37:38.760
They're void in spades, you
should be counting the cards.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.000
I'm sorry, I got distracted

37:40.080 --> 37:42.080
by being held
hostage at gunpoint.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.640
Well, could the hostage taker
please pass us the port?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.800
Might be here some
time. [coughs]

37:47.880 --> 37:49.720
I think I'd rather get shot.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.720
[suspenseful music]

37:53.800 --> 37:56.520
[dramatic music]

38:05.080 --> 38:07.600
[Sam grunting]

38:09.720 --> 38:11.920
[gun clicks]

38:12.000 --> 38:13.800
Three rubbers of bloody Whist,

38:13.880 --> 38:15.400
and it wasn't even loaded!

38:15.480 --> 38:17.920
Well, if I'm not brave enough
to save the woman I love,

38:18.000 --> 38:19.720
hardly brave enough
to load a gun.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.360
Oh, Edwin!

38:21.440 --> 38:23.240
You ruddy idiot, they'll
still throw the book at you!

38:23.320 --> 38:25.320
Being an accessory
after the fact,

38:25.400 --> 38:27.640
false imprisonment and
assaulting a police officer

38:27.720 --> 38:28.960
with a card game!

38:29.040 --> 38:30.520
I don't expect you to wait.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.840
Oh, he's right,
you are an idiot!

38:32.920 --> 38:36.160
I fell in love with you, I
never expected you to change.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.280
Ah, Button.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.040
Impeccable timing, as always.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.440
Mr. Bellamy's car was found
near the station, sir,

38:41.520 --> 38:43.160
abandoned, we thought it
might have been stolen.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.200
Right, arrest him.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.720
Come on, what are
you waiting for?

38:46.800 --> 38:47.920
Right you are, sir.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.400
[exciting music]

38:49.480 --> 38:50.840
Arrest him for what, sir?

38:50.920 --> 38:53.680
[train rattling]

39:00.280 --> 39:01.680
Where are you heading, again?

39:02.960 --> 39:05.600
Oxford, a meeting with my tutor.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.080
It's a tragedy, worthy
of Grecian epic.

39:21.160 --> 39:24.520
Orphans imprisoned in a gilded
tower, guarded by a monster.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.880
Poor children, they
never stood much chance

39:26.960 --> 39:28.520
of a happy ending.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.160
How long will Edwin
get in prison?

39:30.240 --> 39:32.440
It depends on the charges.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.080
False imprisonment alone
should get him life.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.280
Well, the gun was unloaded,

39:36.360 --> 39:38.560
so technically he wasn't armed.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.880
I would hardly a rubber of
Whist a hostage situation.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.240
The law won't see it that way.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.280
Although it would make
it quite a headline.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.840
Police inspector forced
to play Whist at gunpoint.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.840
[exciting music continues]

39:55.920 --> 39:57.120
Stop the train!

39:58.120 --> 39:58.960
Stop, stop!

40:00.760 --> 40:01.920
Stop the train!

40:02.960 --> 40:05.480
Scotland Yard, how exciting.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.760
No doubt you'll be glad to see
the back of Great Slaughter.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.360
Oh, I will.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.640
[Conductor] Next stop, Bicester.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.720
Change for Botley line and
trains for Basingstoke.

40:18.800 --> 40:19.560
That's me.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.400
I thought you were
getting off at Oxford.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.840
My tutor lives on the outskirts,

40:23.920 --> 40:26.680
it's as quick to get
the bus from Bicester.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.480
I must ask you to remain
here, Miss Bellamy.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.480
I must beg to differ, sarge.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.600
[train brakes squeal]

40:43.680 --> 40:46.280
[camera clicks]

40:55.720 --> 40:56.640
Quid pro quo.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.320
Buy you a drink to say thanks.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.160
[sighs] He's a
long way from home.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.280
Someone should be with
him when he wakes up.

41:06.240 --> 41:08.800
[camera clicks]

41:08.880 --> 41:12.360
Sir, Edwin Bellamy, sir,

41:12.440 --> 41:13.720
what am I charging him with?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.920
[Sam sighs]

41:19.560 --> 41:21.280
Possession of an
unlicensed firearm.

41:24.320 --> 41:27.120
[thoughtful music]

41:29.400 --> 41:30.320
Felix.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.920
[clock ticking]

41:33.000 --> 41:34.040
Felix?

41:37.880 --> 41:38.680
Victoria?

41:38.760 --> 41:39.480
Felix.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.400
You're here?

41:41.480 --> 41:42.280
He's awake.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.520
You have a visitor.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.120
You're quite the hero.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.480
Electra Bellamy was
arrested at the scene

41:51.560 --> 41:55.720
and is now being held
for trial at HMP Sonning.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.240
You made the front page.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.240
[Lowsley laughs]

41:59.320 --> 42:00.560
I think they overestimate-

42:00.640 --> 42:03.280
The Lord Lieutenant
was extremely chuffed,

42:03.360 --> 42:06.200
so much so, and given
that his brother-in-law

42:06.280 --> 42:09.920
is the Commissioner for
the Metropolitan Police,

42:12.120 --> 42:14.480
they've agreed that we can
hang on to you for a while!

42:14.560 --> 42:17.200
[Lowsley laughs]

42:17.280 --> 42:18.800
That's, that's...

42:21.560 --> 42:23.080
It's my pleasure, all decided.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.560
Congratulations.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.360
-Thank you.
-I think he's pleased.

42:27.440 --> 42:28.240
Yes.

42:28.320 --> 42:31.200
Thank you. [laughs]

42:31.280 --> 42:32.000
[Sister Boniface] You
know what we should do,

42:32.080 --> 42:33.640
we should celebrate.

42:33.720 --> 42:34.920
[Lowsley] Yes, well, I've got
to tee off in half an hour,

42:35.000 --> 42:35.800
so I can't hang
around, I'm afraid.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.480
[curious music]

42:40.360 --> 42:43.920
[swelling triumphant music]
