00:02.500 --> 00:06.834
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

00:02.500 --> 00:06.834
<i>Stardate 41775.5.</i>

00:06.875 --> 00:09.542
<i>We are en route to the ocean</i>

00:06.875 --> 00:09.542
<i>world of Pacifica.</i>

00:09.583 --> 00:12.041
<i>While our mission</i>

00:09.583 --> 00:12.041
<i>is scientific in nature</i>

00:12.083 --> 00:13.917
<i>we look forward</i>

00:12.083 --> 00:13.917
<i>to the warm, blue waters</i>

00:13.959 --> 00:17.500
<i>and fine beaches that make</i>

00:13.959 --> 00:17.500
<i>Pacifica a jewel of the galaxy.</i>

00:17.542 --> 00:19.625
...so the guy staggers

00:17.542 --> 00:19.625
to his feet

00:19.667 --> 00:21.500
and goes back

00:19.667 --> 00:21.500
to the girl, right?

00:21.542 --> 00:25.458
Well, she smiles, looks him

00:21.542 --> 00:25.458
straight in the eye and says

00:25.500 --> 00:27.709
"just try that in hyperspace."

00:27.750 --> 00:30.709
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:32.959 --> 00:34.500
I see.

00:34.542 --> 00:37.458
So the difficulty in attaining

00:34.542 --> 00:37.458
such complex positioning

00:37.500 --> 00:39.041
in zero gravity environment

00:39.083 --> 00:40.709
coupled with the

00:39.083 --> 00:40.709
adverse effects

00:40.750 --> 00:42.166
it would have on the

00:40.750 --> 00:42.166
psychological well-being

00:42.208 --> 00:43.500
of the average human male

00:43.542 --> 00:45.709
is what makes this anecdote

00:43.542 --> 00:45.709
so amusing.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.875
Yes, very humorous indeed.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.875
Hysterical,

00:48.917 --> 00:50.875
in fact.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.667
(<i> forced laughter</i> )

01:03.875 --> 01:05.542
(<i> chuckling</i> )

01:05.583 --> 01:08.083
What is our E.T.A.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.083
at Pacifica, Mr. La Forge?

01:08.125 --> 01:11.083
22 hours,

01:08.125 --> 01:11.083
14 minutes, sir.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.542
Increase to warp six.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.458
LA FORGE:

01:12.583 --> 01:14.458
Aye, sir, full impulse.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.875
Do you think

01:14.500 --> 01:15.875
anyone would object

01:15.917 --> 01:17.291
to our arriving

01:15.917 --> 01:17.291
ahead of schedule?

01:17.333 --> 01:19.041
I know I won't.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.875
I've been really looking

01:19.083 --> 01:21.875
forward to a nice swim.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.542
DATA:

01:21.917 --> 01:23.542
You are aware, Counselor,

01:23.583 --> 01:24.959
that the holodeck

01:23.583 --> 01:24.959
can be programmed

01:25.000 --> 01:26.709
to recreate

01:25.000 --> 01:26.709
an oceanic environment.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.458
Data, it's just

01:26.750 --> 01:29.458
not the same.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.417
Have you ever been for

01:29.500 --> 01:33.417
a real moonlight swim?

01:33.458 --> 01:35.750
One can swim in moonlight?

01:37.250 --> 01:39.375
How about you,

01:37.250 --> 01:39.375
Mr. Worf?

01:40.959 --> 01:43.250
Swimming is too much like...

01:43.291 --> 01:44.625
bathing.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.166
(<i> console beeping</i> )

01:46.208 --> 01:48.542
Commander Riker...

01:48.583 --> 01:50.375
I'm receiving a Code 47.

01:50.417 --> 01:51.583
Verify.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.917
It<i> is</i> Code 47, sir.

01:53.959 --> 01:55.917
Starfleet emergency frequency.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.792
Code 47?

01:57.834 --> 01:59.458
Captain's eyes only.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.083
RIKER: Captain, I'm

01:59.500 --> 02:02.083
sorry to disturb you.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.834
Yes, Number One, what is it?

02:03.875 --> 02:05.875
An incoming message.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.125
Code 47, sir.

02:08.166 --> 02:09.959
Pipe it through.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.834
COMPUTER:

02:12.583 --> 02:14.834
This is an emergency communiquÃ©.

02:14.875 --> 02:17.667
It is not to be discussed

02:14.875 --> 02:17.667
with fellow officers

02:17.709 --> 02:21.166
unless deemed

02:17.709 --> 02:21.166
absolutely necessary.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.250
There will be

02:21.208 --> 02:23.250
no computer record

02:23.291 --> 02:24.959
of said transmission.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.542
Understood.

02:26.583 --> 02:30.291
COMPUTER: Proceed with

02:26.583 --> 02:30.291
voice print identification.

02:30.333 --> 02:31.625
Picard, Jean-Luc.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.375
Captain, USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

02:33.417 --> 02:34.417
(<i> screen hums</i> )

02:34.458 --> 02:36.583
Voice print verified.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.166
Walker.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.542
Hello, Jean-Luc.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.417
It's been a long time.

02:44.458 --> 02:47.250
Too long, old friend.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.709
Why are you contacting me

02:47.291 --> 02:49.709
on this frequency?

02:49.750 --> 02:52.333
It was a difficult decision.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.834
I felt it was worth the risk.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.333
Risk?

02:56.375 --> 02:57.959
It's about Starfleet.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.083
About something we've always

02:58.000 --> 03:01.083
considered to be impossible.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.375
I don't understand.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.583
I can't explain it now.

03:05.625 --> 03:08.917
We need to talk face-to-face.

03:08.959 --> 03:11.250
You're using a Code 47.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.083
I have to know

03:11.291 --> 03:13.083
what all this is about.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.041
Not over subspace. No.

03:15.083 --> 03:18.250
Oh, for God's sake, Walker,

03:15.083 --> 03:18.250
this is a secured channel.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.834
No!

03:21.583 --> 03:25.792
I want you to meet me

03:21.583 --> 03:25.792
on Dytallix B.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.041
When?

03:27.083 --> 03:28.500
Immediately.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.750
No, not possible.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.959
We're expected at Pacifica.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.291
That can wait.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.166
You owe me.

03:35.208 --> 03:39.083
And you owe it to yourself

03:35.208 --> 03:39.083
to hear what I have to say.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.750
Something is beginning.

03:42.792 --> 03:45.333
Don't trust anyone.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.166
Remember that, Jean-Luc.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.083
Don't take anything for granted.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.500
Walker...

03:50.542 --> 03:51.834
Dytallix B.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.500
We'll be waiting.

04:20.959 --> 04:25.291
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:25.333 --> 04:29.667
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:25.333 --> 04:29.667
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

04:29.709 --> 04:31.291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:31.333 --> 04:35.458
<i>to explore</i>

04:31.333 --> 04:35.458
<i>strange new worlds</i>

04:35.500 --> 04:40.041
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:35.500 --> 04:40.041
<i>and new civilizations</i>

04:40.083 --> 04:43.917
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:40.083 --> 04:43.917
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:48.250 --> 05:52.875
Data, are you familiar

05:48.250 --> 05:52.875
with Dytallix B?

05:52.917 --> 05:55.750
Dytallix B is one of seven

05:52.917 --> 05:55.750
uninhabited planets

05:55.792 --> 05:58.834
mined for the Federation

05:55.792 --> 05:58.834
by the Dytallix Mining Company.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.375
It is in the nearby

05:58.875 --> 06:01.375
Mira System.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.750
Mr. La Forge, chart a course

06:01.417 --> 06:03.750
for it immediately, warp 7.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.667
And there will be

06:03.792 --> 06:05.667
no records

06:05.709 --> 06:07.750
or logs mentioning

06:05.709 --> 06:07.750
any aspect

06:07.792 --> 06:09.333
of this diversion.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.959
RIKER: Captain, they're

06:09.375 --> 06:11.959
expecting us at Pacifica.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.709
Shouldn't we contact them

06:12.000 --> 06:13.709
and let them know?

06:13.750 --> 06:15.959
Negative.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.959
Nothing goes out

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
without specific orders

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
from me.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.959
Hopefully, the delay...

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
will be minimal.

06:44.166 --> 06:47.000
(<i> beeping, buzzing</i> )

06:49.125 --> 06:51.583
I have the readout

06:49.125 --> 06:51.583
on Dytallix B, Commander.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.959
What have you got?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.333
Dytallix B is

06:59.000 --> 07:01.333
the fifth of six planets

07:01.375 --> 07:03.667
circling the red giant

07:01.375 --> 07:03.667
known as Mira.

07:03.709 --> 07:05.750
One side always

07:03.709 --> 07:05.750
faces the sun

07:05.792 --> 07:08.333
where temperatures reach

07:05.792 --> 07:08.333
up to 180 degrees.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.041
The mines line

07:08.375 --> 07:10.041
the temperate zone

07:10.083 --> 07:11.834
between the day

07:10.083 --> 07:11.834
and night sides

07:11.875 --> 07:13.250
but they are

07:11.875 --> 07:13.250
long deserted.

07:13.291 --> 07:16.291
Why the devil are we

07:13.291 --> 07:16.291
going to this planet?

07:16.333 --> 07:17.583
Are there any miners

07:17.625 --> 07:19.792
or indigenous life-forms

07:17.625 --> 07:19.792
on the planet?

07:19.834 --> 07:22.417
I believe the answer

07:19.834 --> 07:22.417
to both questions is no, sir.

07:22.458 --> 07:23.709
In a manner of speaking

07:23.750 --> 07:25.750
it is nothing

07:23.750 --> 07:25.750
but a lifeless hunk of rock,

07:25.792 --> 07:27.917
a useless ball of mud,

07:25.792 --> 07:27.917
a worthless chunk...

07:27.959 --> 07:30.583
Thank you, Data.

07:27.959 --> 07:30.583
I get the idea.

07:31.834 --> 07:34.500
Captain, we are approaching

07:31.834 --> 07:34.500
Dytallix B.

07:34.542 --> 07:37.375
PICARD: Very good,

07:34.542 --> 07:37.375
Number One. I'm on my way.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.834
WORF:

07:47.041 --> 07:48.834
Captain...

07:48.875 --> 07:51.333
sensors are detecting

07:48.875 --> 07:51.333
three Federation starships

07:51.375 --> 07:53.125
already in orbit

07:51.375 --> 07:53.125
around the planet.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.542
Identify.

07:54.583 --> 07:55.959
Two are

07:54.583 --> 07:55.959
frigates.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.041
The<i> Renegade,</i>

07:56.000 --> 07:58.041
commanded by Tryla Scott

07:58.083 --> 08:01.875
and the<i> Thomas Paine,</i>

07:58.083 --> 08:01.875
Captain Rixx commanding.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.500
DATA: The third is just

08:04.000 --> 08:06.500
coming into range now, sir.

08:06.542 --> 08:09.125
It is Ambassador-class,

08:06.542 --> 08:09.125
heavy cruiser

08:09.166 --> 08:11.917
USS<i> Horatio.</i>

08:11.959 --> 08:13.542
<i>Horatio?</i>

08:13.583 --> 08:15.792
Isn't that

08:13.583 --> 08:15.792
Walker Keel's ship?

08:15.834 --> 08:17.250
Attempts at communication

08:17.291 --> 08:18.917
have been ignored

08:17.291 --> 08:18.917
by all three vessels.

08:18.959 --> 08:21.333
Make no further attempts,

08:18.959 --> 08:21.333
Mr. Worf.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.125
Any life-form readings

08:21.375 --> 08:24.125
on the surface, Data?

08:24.166 --> 08:25.333
Three, sir.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.333
All gathered inside

08:25.375 --> 08:27.333
what appears to be

08:27.375 --> 08:29.417
the entrance

08:27.375 --> 08:29.417
to a mining tunnel.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.375
Very well.

08:31.417 --> 08:34.250
Relay those coordinates

08:31.417 --> 08:34.250
to the Transporter Room.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.709
I'm beaming down.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.166
RIKER:

08:35.750 --> 08:37.166
Alone, Captain?

08:37.208 --> 08:39.291
Alone, Number One.

08:54.291 --> 08:57.083
(<i> wind howling</i> )

09:49.000 --> 09:50.834
Thanks for coming.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.083
This is some greeting,

09:52.500 --> 09:56.083
old friend.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.500
Tell me, Jean-Luc.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.250
Where did we

09:58.542 --> 10:00.250
first meet?

10:03.208 --> 10:05.250
Answer the question.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.542
Tau Ceti III.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.250
It was a bar...

10:11.291 --> 10:13.000
quite an exotic one,

10:11.291 --> 10:13.000
as I remember.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.250
What do I win?

10:16.375 --> 10:19.166
Do you recall the night

10:19.208 --> 10:21.083
you introduced Jack Crusher

10:19.208 --> 10:21.083
to Beverly?

10:24.083 --> 10:26.333
You know full well

10:24.083 --> 10:26.333
that I hadn't met Beverly then.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.208
<i>You</i> introduced them.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.875
My brother introduced them.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.625
You don't have a brother--

10:29.917 --> 10:32.625
two sisters, Anne and Melissa.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.333
What the hell

10:32.667 --> 10:34.333
is all this about?

10:34.375 --> 10:36.875
(<i> sighs</i> )

10:39.750 --> 10:41.875
Apologies, Captain.

10:41.917 --> 10:44.625
We had to be sure

10:41.917 --> 10:44.625
you were really you.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.792
Walker, what is going on?

10:46.834 --> 10:49.542
Captain Picard,

10:46.834 --> 10:49.542
meet Captain Rixx.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.959
I believe we've met--

10:53.000 --> 10:54.792
the Altarian Conference.

10:56.125 --> 10:58.291
And Captain Scott.

10:59.375 --> 11:01.542
Tryla Scott.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.041
It's said you made captain

11:03.083 --> 11:05.000
faster than anyone

11:03.083 --> 11:05.000
in Starfleet history.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.709
Present company included.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.875
Are you that good?

11:08.917 --> 11:10.834
Yes, I am.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.625
Starfleet's finest.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.583
Fancy meeting you here.

11:15.625 --> 11:20.417
We all came secretly, Picard,

11:15.625 --> 11:20.417
to discuss the threat.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.083
What threat?

11:22.125 --> 11:24.792
Have you noticed anything

11:22.125 --> 11:24.792
about Starfleet Command lately?

11:24.834 --> 11:26.291
Anything unusual?

11:26.333 --> 11:30.166
No, but we've been

11:26.333 --> 11:30.166
on the outer rim for a while.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.667
We haven't had much contact

11:30.208 --> 11:32.667
with them.

11:32.709 --> 11:35.959
Some of us have seen

11:32.709 --> 11:35.959
strange patterns emerging.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.542
Unusual orders.

11:37.583 --> 11:40.458
High ranking officials

11:37.583 --> 11:40.458
backing irrational proposals.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.875
Starbase 12 was completely

11:40.500 --> 11:43.875
evacuated for two full days.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.959
No explanation given.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.208
SCOTT:

11:46.000 --> 11:48.208
And what about the deaths?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.458
McKinney...

11:49.500 --> 11:53.458
Ryan Sipe,

11:49.500 --> 11:53.458
Onna Karapleedeez.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.125
All dead?

11:58.166 --> 11:59.458
SCOTT:

11:58.166 --> 11:59.458
A series of accidents.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.375
WALKER:

11:59.500 --> 12:01.375
Or so they say.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.792
It's hard to be

12:01.417 --> 12:02.792
certain of anything.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.792
Interfleet communications

12:02.834 --> 12:05.792
are at a minimum.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.458
But something

12:05.834 --> 12:07.458
is happening.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.667
And we fully expect

12:07.500 --> 12:09.667
the<i> Enterprise</i>

12:09.709 --> 12:11.166
to be targeted soon.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.583
Targeted for what?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.583
By whom?

12:13.625 --> 12:15.250
WALKER:

12:13.625 --> 12:15.250
We're not sure yet.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.834
Damn it, Jean-Luc, I tell you

12:16.875 --> 12:19.625
that some of Starfleet's

12:16.875 --> 12:19.625
top command people are changing.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.667
This could affect the very

12:19.667 --> 12:22.667
core of our organization.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.792
Officers I've known for years

12:22.709 --> 12:25.792
are bluffing their way

12:25.834 --> 12:27.417
through talk

12:25.834 --> 12:27.417
of old times.

12:27.458 --> 12:31.375
That's their weakness--

12:27.458 --> 12:31.375
a lack of memory.

12:35.709 --> 12:37.041
He doesn't

12:35.709 --> 12:37.041
believe us.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.959
He thinks

12:37.083 --> 12:38.959
we're crazy.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.083
You've given me nothing

12:40.500 --> 12:42.083
to believe in.

12:42.125 --> 12:45.000
Just a lot of vague talk

12:42.125 --> 12:45.000
about strange patterns.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.291
Irrational proposals.

12:48.959 --> 12:51.500
Who's behind this,

12:48.959 --> 12:51.500
and to what purpose?

12:51.542 --> 12:53.667
How are people being changed?

12:53.709 --> 12:56.375
I can't say exactly,

12:56.417 --> 12:59.041
but I think it's spread

12:56.417 --> 12:59.041
to my own ship.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.750
My first officer

12:59.083 --> 13:00.750
hasn't been the same

13:00.792 --> 13:02.625
since we stopped off at Earth.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.583
Our medical officer says

13:02.667 --> 13:04.583
he's perfectly normal

13:04.625 --> 13:06.041
but I don't think

13:04.625 --> 13:06.041
I trust him either.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.291
Walker...

13:07.333 --> 13:09.792
We know we don't have

13:07.333 --> 13:09.792
all the answers.

13:09.834 --> 13:12.291
All we ask is that

13:09.834 --> 13:12.291
you keep your eyes open.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.834
That's sound advice

13:12.333 --> 13:14.834
at any time, Captain.

13:14.875 --> 13:18.500
Stay in touch with us.

13:14.875 --> 13:18.500
Covertly.

13:19.583 --> 13:20.917
This meeting

13:19.583 --> 13:20.917
never took place

13:20.959 --> 13:22.709
as far as Starfleet

13:20.959 --> 13:22.709
is concerned.

13:25.625 --> 13:29.709
Please, I'm asking this

13:25.625 --> 13:29.709
as a personal favor.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.959
I'm glad, Jean-Luc.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.625
I'm glad

13:38.000 --> 13:40.625
you're still one of us.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.959
Tell Beverly I...

13:42.500 --> 13:45.959
I said hello.

13:58.458 --> 14:01.875
RIXX:

13:58.458 --> 14:01.875
And watch your back, Picard.

14:17.417 --> 14:20.208
Friends-- close friends--

14:17.417 --> 14:20.208
are few and far between.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.625
Two of the oldest

14:20.250 --> 14:22.625
and closest

14:22.667 --> 14:25.125
are Jack Crusher--

14:22.667 --> 14:25.125
may he rest in peace--

14:25.166 --> 14:27.041
and Walker Keel.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.166
Before various missions

14:27.083 --> 14:29.166
spilt us up,

14:29.208 --> 14:31.291
we were virtually

14:29.208 --> 14:31.291
inseparable.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.583
I trust Keel completely.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.625
If he felt it necessary

14:34.625 --> 14:36.625
to violate regulations,

14:36.667 --> 14:38.125
he must have had

14:36.667 --> 14:38.125
a very good reason.

14:38.166 --> 14:41.458
But you're putting your career

14:38.166 --> 14:41.458
at risk for him.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.333
Friendship must dare to risk,

14:41.500 --> 14:44.333
Counselor,

14:44.375 --> 14:45.750
or it's not friendship.

14:45.792 --> 14:47.291
They illicitly used

14:47.333 --> 14:49.000
the emergency channel

14:47.333 --> 14:49.000
to draw you here.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.875
Then they ask you

14:49.041 --> 14:50.875
to keep secrets

14:50.917 --> 14:52.542
from your

14:50.917 --> 14:52.542
superiors--

14:52.583 --> 14:55.709
effectively, to disobey

14:52.583 --> 14:55.709
Starfleet regulations.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.625
The people involved in this

14:55.750 --> 14:58.625
are of the highest caliber.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.125
If I didn't believe

14:58.667 --> 15:00.125
in their loyalty,

15:00.166 --> 15:01.792
I wouldn't have

15:00.166 --> 15:01.792
gone this far.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.250
Don't you think you should

15:01.834 --> 15:04.250
tell the rest of the crew?

15:04.291 --> 15:08.417
No. I don't want to

15:04.291 --> 15:08.417
risk implicating them...

15:08.458 --> 15:10.041
not until I have

15:08.458 --> 15:10.041
solid evidence

15:10.083 --> 15:12.625
that something

15:10.083 --> 15:12.625
really is wrong.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.125
Take us out of orbit,

15:18.333 --> 15:20.125
Mr. La Forge.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.542
Aye, sir.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.625
Resume heading to Pacifica,

15:21.583 --> 15:23.625
warp factor eight.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.583
Aye, sir, warp eight.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.208
At that speed, we should arrive

15:27.250 --> 15:30.500
9.63 hours behind

15:27.250 --> 15:30.500
the original schedule, sir.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.709
Very good. Data, I have

15:30.542 --> 15:32.709
an assignment for you--

15:32.750 --> 15:35.125
one specifically suited

15:32.750 --> 15:35.125
to your talents.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.291
(<i> keyboard beeping</i> )

15:42.125 --> 15:45.500
Computer, this is

15:42.125 --> 15:45.500
Lieutenant Commander Data.

15:45.542 --> 15:48.250
Please access

15:45.542 --> 15:48.250
all Starfleet command orders

15:48.291 --> 15:50.834
to starships, starbases,

15:48.291 --> 15:50.834
and colonies

15:50.875 --> 15:52.250
for the last six months.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.959
COMPUTER:

15:52.291 --> 15:53.959
Working.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.125
PICARD:

16:09.875 --> 16:11.125
Doctor?

16:11.166 --> 16:12.750
I understand

16:11.166 --> 16:12.750
the<i> Horatio</i>

16:12.792 --> 16:15.291
was seen in orbit

16:12.792 --> 16:15.291
around Dytallix.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.834
Did you see Walker?

16:16.875 --> 16:18.625
No.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.750
Oh, I would have loved

16:18.667 --> 16:21.750
to have seen him.

16:21.792 --> 16:23.667
It wasn't possible, Doctor.

16:23.709 --> 16:26.917
Captain, I am picking up

16:23.709 --> 16:26.917
an unusual disturbance

16:26.959 --> 16:28.041
in the nearby quadrant.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.875
Confirmed, sir.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.875
Sector 63.

16:30.917 --> 16:34.250
Specify.

16:30.917 --> 16:34.250
What kind of disturbance?

16:34.291 --> 16:37.375
Hard to say

16:34.291 --> 16:37.375
at this distance, sir.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.625
I guess the trip

16:37.417 --> 16:39.625
to Pacifica will have to wait.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.041
Uh-huh.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.250
Let's investigate.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.291
Maintain speed.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.291
Alter course accordingly.

16:45.333 --> 16:50.542
Aye, sir, changing course to

16:45.333 --> 16:50.542
three-five-one, mark four.

17:02.417 --> 17:05.041
Approaching Sector 63, sir.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.792
Slow to impulse.

17:06.834 --> 17:11.583
Aye, sir,

17:06.834 --> 17:11.583
going to impulse power... now.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.917
Sensors beginning

17:11.625 --> 17:13.917
to pick up small objects, sir.

17:13.959 --> 17:15.583
On screen.

17:19.959 --> 17:22.208
Doesn't look natural.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.208
Agreed.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.000
Enlarge and identify.

17:26.917 --> 17:29.083
WORF:

17:26.917 --> 17:29.083
It looks like...

17:29.125 --> 17:33.834
debris from a space vessel

17:29.125 --> 17:33.834
of some kind.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.834
It could be one of those ships

17:33.875 --> 17:36.834
that was orbiting Dytallix.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.000
We are in close proximity

17:36.875 --> 17:39.000
to that planet.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.333
Identifying marks, Mr. Worf?

17:51.375 --> 17:53.291
Nothing so far.

17:53.333 --> 17:57.333
Sensors not detecting

17:53.333 --> 17:57.333
any bodies in the flotsam.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.250
But from the amount

17:57.375 --> 17:59.250
of the wreckage...

18:02.125 --> 18:03.208
I'm sorry, sir.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.375
It can only be the<i> Horatio.</i>

18:07.375 --> 18:10.667
From the looks of it,

18:07.375 --> 18:10.667
she's been totally destroyed.

18:21.375 --> 18:25.959
<i>Captain's Personal Log,</i>

18:21.375 --> 18:25.959
<i>Stardate 41776.1.</i>

18:26.041 --> 18:28.208
<i>The apparent death</i>

18:26.041 --> 18:28.208
<i>of Walker Keel</i>

18:28.250 --> 18:30.458

18:28.250 --> 18:30.458
<i>on me.</i>

18:30.500 --> 18:33.542
<i>I now believe</i>

18:30.500 --> 18:33.542
<i>there may be a cancer growing</i>

18:33.583 --> 18:35.792
<i>within the ranks of Starfleet.</i>

18:35.834 --> 18:38.417
<i>As a result, I have alerted</i>

18:35.834 --> 18:38.417
<i>my executive officer</i>

18:38.458 --> 18:40.959
<i>to the suspicions voiced</i>

18:38.458 --> 18:40.959
<i>by Keel and the others.</i>

18:41.000 --> 18:42.500
There's no proof

18:41.000 --> 18:42.500
of anything.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.166
The last time

18:42.542 --> 18:44.166
I saw Admiral Quinn,

18:44.208 --> 18:46.333
he tried to warn me

18:44.208 --> 18:46.333
about a subversion

18:46.375 --> 18:48.458
within the Federation.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.166
And Walker tried.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.166
And he's dead.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.041
Subversion?

18:54.083 --> 18:55.375
Personally,

18:54.083 --> 18:55.375
I don't believe

18:55.417 --> 18:57.500
this conspiracy

18:55.417 --> 18:57.500
theory.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.917
DATA:

18:59.959 --> 19:01.917
Startling.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.291
Quite extraordinary, in fact.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.375
COMPUTER:

19:04.333 --> 19:06.375
Direction unclear.

19:06.417 --> 19:09.375
Please repeat request.

19:09.417 --> 19:10.917
That was not a request.

19:10.959 --> 19:13.959
I was simply...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.208
talking to myself.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.959
A human idiosyncrasy

19:21.000 --> 19:23.834
triggered by a fascination

19:21.000 --> 19:23.834
with a particular set of facts.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.250
Or sometimes brought about

19:23.875 --> 19:26.250
by senility.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.834
Or, used as a means

19:26.291 --> 19:28.834
of weighing information

19:28.875 --> 19:30.875
before reaching a conclusion.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.875
Or, as a...

19:30.917 --> 19:33.208
COMPUTER:

19:30.917 --> 19:33.208
Thank you, sir. I comprehend.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.083
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

19:35.125 --> 19:39.542
Please specify how

19:35.125 --> 19:39.542
you would like to proceed, sir.

19:39.583 --> 19:42.000
Please continue

19:39.583 --> 19:42.000
with record scan.

19:48.417 --> 19:51.000
Intriguing.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.166
But if we have no facts,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.166
we have to assume

19:57.208 --> 19:58.792
that the explosion

19:57.208 --> 19:58.792
was an accident.

19:58.834 --> 19:59.959
(<i> door hisses</i> )

20:02.208 --> 20:03.583
Number One, I believe

20:03.625 --> 20:05.667
that what happened

20:03.625 --> 20:05.667
on the<i> Horatio</i> was sabotage.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.333
But if we can't

20:05.709 --> 20:07.333
be certain...

20:07.375 --> 20:09.250
DATA:

20:07.375 --> 20:09.250
Perhaps we can.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.875
My orders were to search

20:10.917 --> 20:13.959
for abnormal patterns

20:10.917 --> 20:13.959
in Starfleet's directives.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.417
I believe I have found

20:14.000 --> 20:16.417
just that.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.291
These are various

20:21.834 --> 20:24.291
outposts and starbases

20:24.333 --> 20:26.083
where I have detected

20:24.333 --> 20:26.083
unusual activity

20:26.125 --> 20:27.542
over the past few months.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.542
What sort of activity?

20:29.583 --> 20:32.458
An uncustomary reshuffling

20:29.583 --> 20:32.458
of personnel--

20:32.500 --> 20:34.083
usually in the command areas.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.458
The new officers

20:34.125 --> 20:36.458
have had frequent contact

20:36.500 --> 20:38.959
with the highest levels

20:36.500 --> 20:38.959
of Starfleet Command.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.792
Why hasn't anyone

20:39.000 --> 20:42.792
discovered this before?

20:42.834 --> 20:45.166
The orders were given

20:42.834 --> 20:45.166
with great subtlety.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.542
To use an aphorism:

20:46.583 --> 20:48.083
Starfleet's left hand

20:46.583 --> 20:48.083
did not know

20:48.125 --> 20:50.208
what its right hand was doing.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.041
Data, can you speculate

20:50.250 --> 20:52.041
as to the purpose

20:52.083 --> 20:54.709
of these reassignments?

20:54.750 --> 20:57.000
I believe it is

20:54.750 --> 20:57.000
a clandestine attempt

20:57.041 --> 21:00.125
to control vital sectors

20:57.041 --> 21:00.125
of Federation territory.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.458
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:02.500 --> 21:05.125
This could be a prelude

21:02.500 --> 21:05.125
to an invasion.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.000
But who's behind it?

21:07.041 --> 21:09.834
There's insufficient data

21:07.041 --> 21:09.834
to make such an assessment, sir.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.208
Are you suggesting

21:11.250 --> 21:12.709
that we warp over to

21:11.250 --> 21:12.709
Starfleet Headquarters

21:12.750 --> 21:14.959
and demand to know

21:12.750 --> 21:14.959
what's going on?

21:17.792 --> 21:19.125
Why not?

21:19.166 --> 21:20.208
PICARD:

21:19.166 --> 21:20.208
Yes, why not?

21:20.250 --> 21:21.834
We're talking about a threat

21:21.875 --> 21:23.959
to the entire future

21:21.875 --> 21:23.959
of the Federation.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I don't think any of us

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
can rest easy

21:27.041 --> 21:29.291
until we've been to the source.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.458
<i>Captain's Personal Log,</i>

21:32.041 --> 21:34.458

21:34.500 --> 21:35.875

21:35.917 --> 21:37.500

21:35.917 --> 21:37.500

21:37.542 --> 21:40.375
<i>we seem to be left</i>

21:37.542 --> 21:40.375
<i>with no other choice.</i>

21:40.417 --> 21:42.375
<i>I have apprised</i>

21:40.417 --> 21:42.375
<i>the remaining bridge crew</i>

21:42.417 --> 21:44.041
<i>of our situation.</i>

21:44.083 --> 21:46.083
Approaching

21:44.083 --> 21:46.083
Earth, Captain.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.542
Standard orbit,

21:46.125 --> 21:47.542
Mr. La Forge.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.417
Standard

21:47.583 --> 21:49.417
orbit, sir.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.291
Any word from Starfleet

21:52.000 --> 21:54.291
Command, Data?

21:54.333 --> 21:57.333
Nothing

21:54.333 --> 21:57.333
so far, sir.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.917
Strange.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.208
(<i> console beeps</i> )

22:17.250 --> 22:19.291
Captain, I am now

22:17.250 --> 22:19.291
receiving a message

22:19.333 --> 22:21.166
from Starfleet

22:19.333 --> 22:21.166
Command.

22:21.208 --> 22:22.834
On screen.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.333
Greetings,<i> Enterprise.</i>

22:29.375 --> 22:30.959
I am Admiral Savar.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
This is Admiral Aaron.

22:33.041 --> 22:36.083
And I believe you already know

22:33.041 --> 22:36.083
Admiral Quinn.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.458
Yes, indeed. It's good

22:36.125 --> 22:38.458
to see you again, Admiral.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.208
And you, Captain.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.709
Of course,

22:40.250 --> 22:41.709
we are always delighted

22:41.750 --> 22:44.417
when the<i> Enterprise</i> returns

22:41.750 --> 22:44.417
to the nest.

22:44.458 --> 22:47.375
Yet we are puzzled

22:44.458 --> 22:47.375
by the timing of your visit.

22:47.417 --> 22:49.792
Yes, sir, I can imagine

22:47.417 --> 22:49.792
that you would be.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.458
AARON:

22:49.834 --> 22:51.458
Governor Delaplane of Pacifica

22:51.500 --> 22:53.041
informs us

22:51.500 --> 22:53.041
that you canceled

22:53.083 --> 22:54.625
your scheduled stop there.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.417
Is this true?

22:56.458 --> 22:57.625
Yes, sir, it is.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.542
Explain yourself,

22:57.667 --> 22:59.542
Captain.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.250
Why have you

22:59.583 --> 23:02.250
returned to Earth?

23:02.291 --> 23:06.041
I would rather discuss that

23:02.291 --> 23:06.041
in person, Admiral.

23:15.291 --> 23:18.041
Excuse us for one moment,

23:15.291 --> 23:18.041
Captain.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.250
They seem

23:25.375 --> 23:27.250
normal enough.

23:27.291 --> 23:28.875
On the surface.

23:28.917 --> 23:31.125
Counselor,

23:28.917 --> 23:31.125
any thoughts?

23:31.166 --> 23:32.875
Hard to say.

23:32.917 --> 23:34.458
Someone is

23:32.917 --> 23:34.458
hiding something,

23:34.500 --> 23:36.291
but I can't tell

23:34.500 --> 23:36.291
who or what.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.750
I must say I'm not overjoyed

23:36.333 --> 23:38.750
to see Remmick again.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.041
Considering

23:38.792 --> 23:40.041
what we've done,

23:40.083 --> 23:41.583
their response has been

23:40.083 --> 23:41.583
pretty temperate.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.125
I don't like it.

23:43.166 --> 23:45.083
You can't trust them.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.750
SAVAR: Forgive the delay,

23:45.125 --> 23:47.750
Captain Picard.

23:47.792 --> 23:51.041
We'd be delighted

23:47.792 --> 23:51.041
if you and your first officer

23:51.083 --> 23:52.333
would join us for dinner.

23:52.375 --> 23:53.667
Yes, delighted.

23:53.709 --> 23:55.166
It would give you

23:53.709 --> 23:55.166
a good opportunity

23:55.208 --> 23:57.500
to expatiate

23:55.208 --> 23:57.500
your own viewpoint.

23:57.542 --> 23:58.959
To elaborate upon

23:57.542 --> 23:58.959
whatever it is

23:59.041 --> 24:01.083
that's troubling you.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.166
Thank you, we accept

24:01.125 --> 24:03.166
your gracious offer.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.417
SAVAR:

24:03.208 --> 24:04.417
Excellent.

24:04.458 --> 24:07.333
Preparations are

24:04.458 --> 24:07.333
already underway.

24:07.375 --> 24:10.166
We'll greet you in the

24:07.375 --> 24:10.166
reception area in say...

24:10.208 --> 24:11.500
20 minutes?

24:11.542 --> 24:12.875
Splendid.

24:12.917 --> 24:14.625
QUINN: I won't

24:12.917 --> 24:14.625
be able to attend

24:14.667 --> 24:16.208
the dinner, I'm afraid,

24:16.250 --> 24:17.709
but I would like

24:16.250 --> 24:17.709
to see the ship

24:17.750 --> 24:19.375
and say hello

24:17.750 --> 24:19.375
again, Captain.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.875
Of course.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.375
We look forward

24:20.917 --> 24:22.375
to seeing you, Admiral.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.083
<i>Enterprise</i> out.

24:29.709 --> 24:33.208
Quinn wants

24:29.709 --> 24:33.208
to see us alone.

24:33.250 --> 24:36.291
At least we know

24:33.250 --> 24:36.291
<i>he's</i> still on our side.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.917
Mr. Data,

24:36.333 --> 24:37.917
you have the Bridge.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.208
Aye, sir.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.208
(<i> seagulls calling</i> )

25:12.166 --> 25:15.500
Are you ready to beam up

25:12.166 --> 25:15.500
to the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir?

25:15.542 --> 25:18.250
Yes, Commander.

25:15.542 --> 25:18.250
Quite ready.

25:29.875 --> 25:32.500
Energize,

25:29.875 --> 25:32.500
Mr. Remmick.

25:49.291 --> 25:50.458
Welcome aboard,

25:49.291 --> 25:50.458
Greg.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.417
Good to see you.

25:51.458 --> 25:52.709
You remember

25:51.458 --> 25:52.709
Commander Riker.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.667
Hello again,

25:52.750 --> 25:54.667
Commander.

25:54.709 --> 25:56.500
I must say,

25:54.709 --> 25:56.500
you're looking remarkably well.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.625
Never felt better

25:56.542 --> 25:58.625
in my life.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.333
When you were here last,

26:00.375 --> 26:02.375
you were saying that you

26:00.375 --> 26:02.375
were feeling tired.

26:02.417 --> 26:05.583
Tired of life I was,

26:02.417 --> 26:05.583
but not anymore.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.417
I'm ready

26:05.625 --> 26:07.417
for new challenges now.

26:07.458 --> 26:10.041
What about another look

26:07.458 --> 26:10.041
at this ship?

26:17.417 --> 26:19.625
Remember what you told me

26:17.417 --> 26:19.625
back at Relva VII?

26:19.667 --> 26:21.750
About the threat

26:19.667 --> 26:21.750
that you perceived

26:21.792 --> 26:23.625
to the very fabric

26:21.792 --> 26:23.625
of the Federation?

26:23.667 --> 26:25.417
Is that why you're here,

26:23.667 --> 26:25.417
because of what I said?

26:25.458 --> 26:26.959
It's one of

26:25.458 --> 26:26.959
the reasons, yes.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.500
But Jean-Luc...

26:28.542 --> 26:30.375
you took me

26:28.542 --> 26:30.375
far too literally.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.792
I was only referring

26:30.417 --> 26:32.792
to the problems involved

26:32.834 --> 26:36.333
in assimilating new races

26:32.834 --> 26:36.333
into the Federation.

26:36.375 --> 26:39.208
It's an ongoing,

26:36.375 --> 26:39.208
tumultuous process

26:39.250 --> 26:40.625
which can cause

26:39.250 --> 26:40.625
stress and strain

26:40.667 --> 26:44.542
on every aspect

26:40.667 --> 26:44.542
of our alliance.

26:44.583 --> 26:47.375
I'm sorry.

26:44.583 --> 26:47.375
I must have misunderstood.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.083
It's not for you to apologize.

26:49.125 --> 26:50.667
If I led you up

26:49.125 --> 26:50.667
the garden path

26:50.709 --> 26:53.083
I humbly ask

26:50.709 --> 26:53.083
your forgiveness.

26:53.125 --> 26:54.959
Of course.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.166
Now, gentlemen,

26:56.208 --> 26:57.500
you have a dinner

26:56.208 --> 26:57.500
to attend to

26:57.542 --> 26:59.166
and I would like

26:57.542 --> 26:59.166
to go and freshen up

26:59.208 --> 27:01.208
before I look around

26:59.208 --> 27:01.208
a little bit more.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.041
We've arranged

27:01.250 --> 27:03.041
your usual accommodations, sir.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.542
Well, that's outstanding.

27:04.583 --> 27:08.375
Yes, I should be getting

27:04.583 --> 27:08.375
down to the planet.

27:08.417 --> 27:10.834
Commander Riker will

27:08.417 --> 27:10.834
be available here

27:10.875 --> 27:12.709
to show you anything

27:10.875 --> 27:12.709
that you want to see.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.458
It's really

27:12.750 --> 27:14.458
not necessary.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.000
Oh, I insist.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.917
When you've finished

27:16.041 --> 27:17.917
showing the admiral

27:17.959 --> 27:19.250
anything that he needs,

27:19.291 --> 27:20.625
you can join me

27:19.291 --> 27:20.625
down on Earth.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.792
I may want to stay

27:20.667 --> 27:22.792
a while, Jean-Luc.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.041
Of course.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.875
Stay as long

27:24.083 --> 27:25.875
as you wish.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.500
No.

27:40.917 --> 27:42.667
That's not

27:40.917 --> 27:42.667
Gregory Quinn.

27:42.709 --> 27:43.959
It may look like him

27:42.709 --> 27:43.959
and sound like him

27:44.000 --> 27:45.208
but it isn't him.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.458
Are you absolutely

27:45.250 --> 27:46.458
certain, Captain?

27:46.500 --> 27:48.083
I'm certain,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.083
Number One.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.959
Now, I want you

27:48.125 --> 27:49.959
to stay close.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.291
Keep your eye on

27:50.000 --> 27:52.291
his every move.

27:52.333 --> 27:55.250
Have... have Beverly

27:52.333 --> 27:55.250
concoct some reason

27:55.291 --> 27:56.959
for giving him a full

27:55.291 --> 27:56.959
medical examination.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
How?

27:58.041 --> 27:59.083
I don't know.

27:58.041 --> 27:59.083
Just do it.

27:59.125 --> 28:00.208
He's a senior admiral.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.250
It's not him, Will.

28:01.291 --> 28:02.625
I know that now.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.375
What I have to find out

28:02.667 --> 28:04.375
is how this has happened

28:04.417 --> 28:06.333
and who or what

28:04.417 --> 28:06.333
is behind it.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.750
Captain,

28:06.375 --> 28:07.750
if you're right...

28:07.792 --> 28:09.166
I'm right.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.583
Should you be beaming

28:09.208 --> 28:11.583
down there alone, unarmed?

28:11.625 --> 28:12.959
I'll take care.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.583
Find out what you

28:13.000 --> 28:14.583
can, then join me.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.041
In force, if necessary.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.333
Energize.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.375
Good luck, sir.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.583
Welcome home,

28:34.750 --> 28:37.583
Captain Picard.

28:37.625 --> 28:38.959
Thank you.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
My first officer

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
will be joining us shortly.

28:41.041 --> 28:44.583
Yes, I'm sure he will.

28:44.625 --> 28:46.667
You've met Commander

28:44.625 --> 28:46.667
Remmick, haven't you?

28:46.709 --> 28:49.917
Under less than

28:46.709 --> 28:49.917
ideal circumstances.

28:49.959 --> 28:52.667
It's nice to see

28:49.959 --> 28:52.667
you again, Captain.

28:52.709 --> 28:55.333
We have prepared a

28:52.709 --> 28:55.333
special meal in your honor.

28:55.375 --> 28:56.834
Delightful.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.000
Tell me, why is

28:56.875 --> 28:59.000
the corridor so quiet?

28:59.041 --> 29:02.041
The last time I was here,

28:59.041 --> 29:02.041
it was bustling with activity.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.750
It usually is.

29:03.792 --> 29:05.333
Tonight's

29:03.792 --> 29:05.333
a quiet night.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.375
Yes.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.375
A quiet night.

29:13.834 --> 29:15.709
(<i> door chimes</i> )

29:17.500 --> 29:19.875
Ready for your

29:17.500 --> 29:19.875
tour, Admiral?

29:19.917 --> 29:21.709
Quite ready,

29:19.917 --> 29:21.709
Commander.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.500
What's in the case?

29:23.542 --> 29:26.291
Actually, I brought it

29:23.542 --> 29:26.291
for Dr. Crusher.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.291
But perhaps you would

29:26.333 --> 29:29.291
like to see it first.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.417
What is it?

29:30.458 --> 29:31.750
A form of life.

29:31.792 --> 29:34.667
It was discovered accidentally

29:31.792 --> 29:34.667
by a survey team

29:34.709 --> 29:36.500
on an uncharted planet.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.250
Why haven't we heard

29:36.542 --> 29:38.250
anything about that?

29:38.291 --> 29:40.291
Oh, you'll be hearing

29:38.291 --> 29:40.291
about it shortly,

29:40.333 --> 29:42.834
but first, there remains much

29:40.333 --> 29:42.834
scientific study to be done.

29:42.875 --> 29:46.333
After all, it<i> is</i>

29:42.875 --> 29:46.333
a superior form of life.

29:46.375 --> 29:47.291
Superior?

29:47.333 --> 29:48.417
Totally.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.458
Come, have a look.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
I think I'll summon

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
my science officer.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.333
It won't like

29:52.542 --> 29:55.333
your science officer.

29:55.375 --> 29:58.333
It<i> does</i> like you!

29:58.375 --> 30:02.375
Vitamins-- they do

29:58.375 --> 30:02.375
wonders for the body.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.834
(<i> groans</i> )

30:22.834 --> 30:24.917
Riker to Security,

30:22.834 --> 30:24.917
Guest Quarter 17.

30:24.959 --> 30:25.875
Emergency.

30:25.917 --> 30:27.208
(<i> menacing chuckle</i> )

30:50.792 --> 30:54.583
Let's have some Andonian tea

30:50.792 --> 30:54.583
while we wait for your Riker.

30:54.625 --> 30:57.333
Then you can tell us

30:54.625 --> 30:57.333
about what's brought you here.

30:57.375 --> 30:59.583
I see you keep up

30:57.375 --> 30:59.583
with our duty roster.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.959
Yes, of course, Captain.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.333
The<i> Enterprise</i>

31:01.000 --> 31:03.333
is very important to us.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.917
Excuse me,

31:03.375 --> 31:05.917
gentlemen.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.500
To the<i> Horatio,</i>

31:09.583 --> 31:11.500
gentlemen.

31:11.542 --> 31:12.834
The<i> Horatio.</i>

31:18.291 --> 31:20.709
What an awful tragedy.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.917
Such a terrible loss of life.

31:22.959 --> 31:25.125
It's interesting that

31:22.959 --> 31:25.125
you should mention the<i> Horatio.</i>

31:25.166 --> 31:27.250
It's one of the subjects

31:25.166 --> 31:27.250
I wanted to discuss.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.083
AARON:

31:27.291 --> 31:29.083
Really?

31:29.125 --> 31:32.250
Has the cause of her destruction

31:29.125 --> 31:32.250
been ascertained?

31:32.291 --> 31:35.667
Absolutely.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.667
Implosion.

31:35.709 --> 31:39.041
Due to the extreme

31:35.709 --> 31:39.041
negligence of her captain.

31:39.083 --> 31:40.667
Enjoy, Picard.

31:40.709 --> 31:43.583
I believe you'll find it

31:40.709 --> 31:43.583
an excellent<i> aperitif.</i>

32:04.000 --> 32:05.208
QUINN:

32:04.000 --> 32:05.208
It's a good thing you're here.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.000
He slipped and

32:05.250 --> 32:07.000
hit his head.

32:07.041 --> 32:09.583
This is Lieutenant La Forge

32:07.041 --> 32:09.583
in Guest Quarter 17.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.125
We have a medical emergency.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.542
Your Dr. Crusher

32:11.166 --> 32:12.542
is most capable.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.041
I'm sure he'll

32:12.583 --> 32:14.041
be all right.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.792
Now, if you'll

32:14.083 --> 32:15.792
excuse me,

32:15.834 --> 32:17.750
my time here

32:15.834 --> 32:17.750
is most limited.

32:17.792 --> 32:19.542
Admiral...

32:19.583 --> 32:20.709
Don't you think

32:19.583 --> 32:20.709
we should wait

32:20.750 --> 32:22.375
till the doctor gets here?

32:28.583 --> 32:32.542
Now, Klingon,

32:28.583 --> 32:32.542
it's between you and me.

32:50.917 --> 32:52.625
(<i> growls</i> )

32:56.834 --> 32:59.709
Do Klingons fear death

32:56.834 --> 32:59.709
as much as humans?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.959
I could snap your

33:01.000 --> 33:02.959
neck in a second,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.125
but it wouldn't be as much fun.

33:11.375 --> 33:13.333
(<i> groaning</i> )

33:24.959 --> 33:26.750
Ooh!

33:28.792 --> 33:30.125
Are you all right?

33:30.166 --> 33:33.083
Oh, if I could see,

33:30.166 --> 33:33.083
I'd be seeing stars.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.125
What<i> is</i> he?

33:41.917 --> 33:44.625
Let's find out.

33:53.583 --> 33:55.875
Retinal scans

33:53.583 --> 33:55.875
are an exact match.

33:55.917 --> 33:57.291
It really is Quinn.

33:57.333 --> 33:58.834
How can that be?

33:57.333 --> 33:58.834
The man picked me up

33:58.875 --> 34:00.625
like a rag doll.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.250
I'm going to have to do

34:00.667 --> 34:03.250
a complete internal scan.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.083
Keep me posted, Doctor.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.083
I'll be on the Bridge.

34:17.792 --> 34:20.417
What is that?!

34:30.041 --> 34:32.917
What do you know

34:30.041 --> 34:32.917
of conspiracies, Captain?

34:32.959 --> 34:34.750
Not nearly enough,

34:32.959 --> 34:34.750
I suppose.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.834
That's the charming thing

34:34.792 --> 34:36.834
about them, isn't it?

34:36.875 --> 34:40.291
When a machination is real,

34:36.875 --> 34:40.291
no one knows about it.

34:40.333 --> 34:44.125
And when it's suspected,

34:40.333 --> 34:44.125
it's almost never real.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.250
Except, of course,

34:44.166 --> 34:46.250
in paranoid delusions

34:46.291 --> 34:49.417
for those

34:46.291 --> 34:49.417
who believe.

34:49.458 --> 34:51.375
Sorry to interrupt.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.792
Dinner is served.

34:52.834 --> 34:54.542
Wonderful.

34:52.834 --> 34:54.542
Bantering with the captain

34:54.583 --> 34:56.000
has given me quite an appetite.

34:56.041 --> 34:57.750
I need to contact

34:56.041 --> 34:57.750
my ship

34:57.792 --> 34:59.959
to let Commander Riker know

34:57.792 --> 34:59.959
that we're about to sit down.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.625
Of course,

35:00.000 --> 35:01.625
Captain.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.041
We'll wait for you

35:01.667 --> 35:04.041
at the table.

35:13.917 --> 35:15.458
Picard to Riker.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.583
Dr. Crusher here, Captain.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.583
May I speak freely?

35:22.333 --> 35:24.834
I suppose I have little choice.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.834
Where is Riker?

35:24.875 --> 35:26.875
He was attacked by Quinn.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.917
Or what we thought was Quinn.

35:28.959 --> 35:30.375
Specify, Doctor.

35:30.417 --> 35:33.792
A parasitic being

35:30.417 --> 35:33.792
has invaded Quinn's body.

35:33.834 --> 35:37.041
It has complete control

35:33.834 --> 35:37.041
over all brain functions.

35:37.083 --> 35:40.041
It seems to breathe

35:37.083 --> 35:40.041
through a small gill

35:40.083 --> 35:42.667
protruding from the back

35:40.083 --> 35:42.667
of Quinn's neck.

35:42.709 --> 35:44.333
Look for this, Captain.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.834
I believe it will be visible

35:45.875 --> 35:49.000
on anyone

35:45.875 --> 35:49.000
who has been compromised.

35:49.041 --> 35:50.750
Any idea of what it is

35:49.041 --> 35:50.750
or where it came from?

35:50.792 --> 35:53.333
Negative, I've never seen

35:50.792 --> 35:53.333
anything like it before.

35:53.375 --> 35:55.083
(<i> beep</i> )

35:53.375 --> 35:55.083
DATA: Lieutenant Worf,

35:55.125 --> 35:56.834
if the situation

35:55.125 --> 35:56.834
is under control,

35:56.875 --> 35:58.542
please report to the Bridge.

35:58.583 --> 35:59.542
Doctor?

35:59.583 --> 36:00.792
It's okay.

36:00.834 --> 36:04.041
He won't be waking up

36:00.834 --> 36:04.041
for a long time.

36:04.083 --> 36:05.750
Continue, Doctor.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.542
By the placement

36:05.792 --> 36:07.542
of the tendrils,

36:07.583 --> 36:09.709
the parasite appears

36:07.583 --> 36:09.709
to stimulate

36:09.750 --> 36:13.583
the victim's adrenal glands,

36:09.750 --> 36:13.583
generating great strength

36:13.625 --> 36:14.959
and resistance to the...

36:15.000 --> 36:16.917
Never mind the details.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.917
Can you remove it?

36:16.959 --> 36:18.625
I don't think so.

36:18.667 --> 36:21.333
Not without killing the patient.

36:23.083 --> 36:26.834
Captain, you must set

36:23.083 --> 36:26.834
your phaser on kill.

36:26.875 --> 36:28.875
Stun has little effect.

36:31.041 --> 36:34.709
Doctor, one does not beam down

36:31.041 --> 36:34.709
to Starfleet Headquarters armed.

36:37.709 --> 36:40.166
Your food

36:37.709 --> 36:40.166
is getting cold, Captain.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.166
I'm going

36:42.250 --> 36:44.166
into dinner now, Doctor.

36:44.208 --> 36:48.333
Tell Commander Riker to join me

36:44.208 --> 36:48.333
as soon as he's ready.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.458
Picard out.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.125
(<i> gasps</i> )

37:04.291 --> 37:06.166
Please, sit down,

37:04.291 --> 37:06.166
Captain.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.917
We've been waiting.

37:15.709 --> 37:17.125
Go ahead and start, Captain.

37:17.166 --> 37:19.250
We don't stand on ceremony here.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.000
(<i> groans</i> )

37:38.333 --> 37:40.250
Oh, do eat up, Picard.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.625
Raise your hand

37:40.291 --> 37:42.625
if you want seconds.

38:14.291 --> 38:16.500
Riker, thank God.

38:16.542 --> 38:17.875
We're leaving.

38:17.917 --> 38:20.083
You're not going anywhere.

38:23.667 --> 38:25.875
You'll be one of us soon.

38:28.583 --> 38:30.709
You were meant

38:28.583 --> 38:30.709
for the doctor.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.166
It couldn't be helped.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.875
Riker walked in on us

38:32.208 --> 38:34.875
unexpectedly.

38:38.458 --> 38:39.917
No matter.

38:39.959 --> 38:42.083
The doctor will be

38:39.959 --> 38:42.083
joining us soon.

38:44.041 --> 38:45.625
All in good time.

38:48.417 --> 38:51.166
SAVAR:

38:48.417 --> 38:51.166
Well, Captain Scott, good.

38:51.208 --> 38:53.625
Now, the setting is complete.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.542
You don't really think

38:56.542 --> 38:58.542
we were in the dark

38:58.583 --> 39:00.458
about your intentions,

38:58.583 --> 39:00.458
do you?

39:00.500 --> 39:03.583
SAVAR: Patience is one of

39:00.500 --> 39:03.583
our virtues, Captain.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.000
We didn't

39:03.625 --> 39:05.000
go after you.

39:05.041 --> 39:07.667
We allowed you to come after<i> us.</i>

39:09.041 --> 39:11.250
More dramatic that way,

39:09.041 --> 39:11.250
don't you think?

39:13.625 --> 39:16.625
Yes, the one thing

39:13.625 --> 39:16.625
both races share

39:16.667 --> 39:18.125
is a love

39:16.667 --> 39:18.125
of theater.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.166
And you've put

39:18.166 --> 39:20.166
on a fine show.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.375
What race are you?

39:21.417 --> 39:22.750
Where are

39:21.417 --> 39:22.750
you from?

39:22.792 --> 39:24.125
SAVAR:

39:22.792 --> 39:24.125
It's not important.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.959
Let us just say

39:26.000 --> 39:28.875
we've come a long way

39:26.000 --> 39:28.875
to join you.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.500
It's a perfect match.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.041
We're the brains.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.041
You're the brawn.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.208
You'll understand soon, Picard.

39:35.250 --> 39:36.959
SAVAR:

39:35.250 --> 39:36.959
Indeed.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.834
We've been moving slowly,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.834
cautiously for many months now.

39:39.875 --> 39:42.166
Careful to cover

39:39.875 --> 39:42.166
our tracks,

39:42.208 --> 39:44.083
careful not to

39:42.208 --> 39:44.083
arouse suspicion

39:44.125 --> 39:46.083
until it's too late.

39:46.125 --> 39:47.667
And now, it's too late.

39:47.709 --> 39:48.750
For you, that is.

39:48.792 --> 39:50.125
Well said, brother.

39:50.166 --> 39:52.709
Picard and Riker

39:50.166 --> 39:52.709
control the<i> Enterprise,</i>

39:52.750 --> 39:55.959
which means<i> we</i> control

39:52.750 --> 39:55.959
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

39:56.000 --> 39:58.875
Eat hearty, brother.

39:58.917 --> 40:01.083
Relish your new body.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.000
(<i> groaning</i> )

40:32.875 --> 40:34.208
Aaron!

40:44.333 --> 40:45.542
Aaron!

40:50.417 --> 40:52.625
(<i> yelling</i> )

41:05.000 --> 41:07.792
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )

41:20.041 --> 41:21.500
Can I help you, gentlemen?

41:23.041 --> 41:25.250
Is there any

41:23.041 --> 41:25.250
trouble here?

41:25.291 --> 41:28.166
Perhaps if you'd tell me

41:25.291 --> 41:28.166
what it is...

41:32.166 --> 41:33.792
Remmick...

41:37.500 --> 41:39.875
No, Will.

42:02.667 --> 42:06.333
You don't understand.

42:06.375 --> 42:10.250
(<i> gurgling</i> )

42:13.333 --> 42:15.709
We mean you no harm.

42:21.375 --> 42:26.083
We seek peaceful co-existence.

42:47.875 --> 42:50.834
(<i> shrill screeching</i> )

43:12.625 --> 43:16.625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

43:12.625 --> 43:16.625
<i>Stardate 41780.2.</i>

43:16.667 --> 43:18.750
<i>How difficult after all</i>

43:16.667 --> 43:18.750
<i>these years of learning</i>

43:18.792 --> 43:21.750
<i>to respect life,</i>

43:18.792 --> 43:21.750
<i>to be forced to destroy it.</i>

43:21.792 --> 43:24.083
<i>But there seems to be</i>

43:21.792 --> 43:24.083
<i>no alternative.</i>

43:24.125 --> 43:26.667
<i>Admiral Quinn is expected</i>

43:24.125 --> 43:26.667
<i>to make a full recovery.</i>

43:26.709 --> 43:28.250
<i>There is no trace</i>

43:26.709 --> 43:28.250
<i>of the parasite</i>

43:28.291 --> 43:30.208
<i>which took control of him.</i>

43:30.250 --> 43:32.709
<i>We'll never know</i>

43:30.250 --> 43:32.709
<i>how many of these life-forms</i>

43:32.750 --> 43:34.291
<i>infiltrated Starfleet</i>

43:34.333 --> 43:36.417
<i>but it seems</i>

43:34.333 --> 43:36.417
<i>they could not survive</i>

43:36.458 --> 43:37.834
<i>without the mother creature</i>

43:37.875 --> 43:40.458
<i>which had taken over</i>

43:37.875 --> 43:40.458
<i>Commander Remmick.</i>

43:40.500 --> 43:44.083
It was Dr. Crusher's idea

43:40.500 --> 43:44.083
to simulate the blue gill.

43:44.125 --> 43:46.250
We had to make sure it would

43:44.125 --> 43:46.250
fool everyone, including you.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.083
That it did, Number One.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.083
Rest assured.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.750
DATA:

43:48.125 --> 43:49.750
Captain?

43:49.792 --> 43:52.417
I have attempted to trace

43:49.792 --> 43:52.417
the message Remmick was sending.

43:52.458 --> 43:53.709
I believe

43:52.458 --> 43:53.709
it was aimed

43:53.750 --> 43:55.792
at an unexplored

43:53.750 --> 43:55.792
sector of our galaxy.

43:56.959 --> 43:59.041
Any idea

43:56.959 --> 43:59.041
what the message was, Data?

44:01.500 --> 44:03.458
I believe

44:01.500 --> 44:03.458
it was a beacon.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.166
A beacon?

44:05.208 --> 44:07.750
Yes, sir.

44:05.208 --> 44:07.750
A homing beacon.

44:07.792 --> 44:10.125
Sent from Earth.

44:25.208 --> 44:28.875
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )
