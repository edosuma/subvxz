The ledger.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.340
I am grateful for this hospitality.

15:52.150 --> 15:55.520
I have severe hand tremors.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.320
If you do not mind,
may I get the help of my servant?

16:00.650 --> 16:02.790
Go ahead.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.290
Thank you.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.130
Bang-deuk!

16:07.630 --> 16:09.600
Come serve me.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.410
Your knees.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.040
Right.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.510
Pour me some water.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.220
Yes, my lord.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.920
[If he really is the nephew
of the Inspector-General,]

16:37.360 --> 16:38.830
[why did he come now of all times?]

16:38.890 --> 16:41.360
[Young Master, please save me.
Must I really do it?]

16:42.060 --> 16:43.060
[Get on with it.]

16:44.370 --> 16:46.000
How mean. That reminds me,

16:47.370 --> 16:50.770
I saw a dead body
on my way here by chance.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.310
Someone died? Who?

16:54.740 --> 16:57.010
Goodness, that is impossible.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.410
Why are you so surprised?

16:59.950 --> 17:02.380
What I meant was, a lady of the village...

17:02.450 --> 17:06.089
You meant a lady. Yes, that is correct.

17:06.950 --> 17:09.990
It seemed she slipped
while she was going up

17:10.060 --> 17:11.859
the mountains for a bath.

17:12.589 --> 17:15.160
The roads in this village
are quite dangerous.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.970
We are discussing ways

17:18.230 --> 17:19.530
to prevent such incidents.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.400
You have it tough.

17:26.369 --> 17:28.240
[Give me another beef pancake. Quickly!]

17:28.640 --> 17:29.640
[Ask him!]

17:32.850 --> 17:34.450
But here is the thing.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.020
Though I am not familiar
with the penal code,

17:38.520 --> 17:40.290
do you not go through an autopsy

17:40.590 --> 17:43.690
when someone dies?

17:40.990 --> 17:43.490
[Bokgum: Autopsy]

17:45.930 --> 17:48.200
It is not even a murder case,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.060
so why would we conduct an autopsy?

17:50.130 --> 17:52.730
It was an accidental death.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.400
I see. I did not know.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.580
Do not worry.
It is natural you might not know.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.110
She was quite a great cook.

18:12.390 --> 18:13.590
[Dig in deeper.]

18:17.730 --> 18:19.230
But is it not strange?

18:19.860 --> 18:21.160
Why would

18:21.230 --> 18:23.830
a pregnant lady go out of her way
to bathe in the cold valley?

18:23.900 --> 18:26.170
Furthermore, how did she walk up

18:26.230 --> 18:29.540
the mountain with that body?

18:31.540 --> 18:32.640
By the way,

18:33.540 --> 18:36.080
how did you know that lady was pregnant?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.250
Well...

18:40.310 --> 18:43.220
I overheard people talking
outside the government office.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.620
But how do you know that, Magistrate?

18:49.620 --> 18:53.430
Well, it happened in my village,

18:53.490 --> 18:55.560
so I also overheard it.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.160
I see.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.140
It did not seem
like the child had a father.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.640
Could someone have murdered her

19:06.710 --> 19:09.010
and disguised it as an accident?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.980
Do not be ridiculous!

19:14.050 --> 19:15.620
Murder?

19:17.420 --> 19:20.890
You are right. It is utterly impossible.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.930
Who would hold a grudge
against a lady of a tavern?

19:27.130 --> 19:28.900
Unless she was in a love affair.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.980
Ask him about the inspector.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.650
By the way,

19:47.450 --> 19:50.320
the inspector who recently inspected
Chungcheong Province

19:50.550 --> 19:52.990
returned looking
like a complete beggar is what I--

19:53.050 --> 19:55.190
That is impossible! Returned?

19:58.560 --> 20:00.060
Maybe you got it wrong.

20:00.130 --> 20:01.800
He could not have returned.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.030
Maybe he was the inspector

20:05.270 --> 20:07.770
of Gyeonggi Province,
not Chungcheong Province.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.840
If you are done eating, please leave.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.140
It is already very late.

20:13.770 --> 20:15.210
Our guests are leaving.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.040
Come now!

20:17.640 --> 20:19.380
Please, just one beef pancake.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.880
I am getting drunk.

20:26.090 --> 20:27.520
Was it nice eating alone?

20:27.920 --> 20:30.890
You should have told him
to prepare a table for us too.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.360
Was that so hard to ask?
I am starving to death right now.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.360
That is not easy.
I was having a hard time acting,

20:35.430 --> 20:36.500
so how could I ask that?

20:37.160 --> 20:38.170
My...

20:42.670 --> 20:44.770
Did I not look like

20:45.040 --> 20:47.070
a chief clerk of the Office of Residence
just now?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.480
Let us go find corroborative evidence.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.250
To where?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.450
The ledger.

21:00.190 --> 21:03.220
Where and what on earth
is the senior secretary doing?

21:03.460 --> 21:06.230
That wench, that peanut-sized wench!

21:06.460 --> 21:09.730
That wicked wench is so impudent.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.830
I gave her soy sauce to eat with rice,

21:11.900 --> 21:13.400
so she would not get an upset stomach,

21:13.470 --> 21:15.640
but she made my precious son

21:15.700 --> 21:17.500
eat that greasy meat.

21:17.570 --> 21:19.970
Can you imagine how many fresh vegetables

21:20.170 --> 21:23.880
I gave her to keep her healthy?

21:23.940 --> 21:25.910
Open up.

21:28.680 --> 21:32.190
I need to go find the ledger.

21:34.190 --> 21:35.520
My lord,

21:37.690 --> 21:41.330
what have you been thinking
since a while ago?

21:43.600 --> 21:47.100
If you have anything to say, go ahead.

21:48.500 --> 21:52.170
Is there something you want from me?

21:56.780 --> 21:58.650
No, I do not.

22:00.450 --> 22:01.650
Stop joking.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.950
If you did not, why did you want us
to come to my house?

22:05.190 --> 22:09.260
Gosh, why are men

22:10.160 --> 22:11.960
so sly?

22:23.070 --> 22:25.770
What a fire pit Joseon is.

22:26.270 --> 22:27.840
You always chanted a Buddhist prayer.

22:29.710 --> 22:31.210
Must be nice to escape from here.

22:32.450 --> 22:33.780
In paradise,

live in an old tile-roofed house,

22:37.050 --> 22:38.490
wear silk clothes,

22:38.750 --> 22:42.090
eat meat soup with seven side dishes,
and be happy.

Here, look at this.

What in the world are the two doing?

23:02.680 --> 23:06.150
-You need to know this.
-I do not need to.

23:06.210 --> 23:09.420
The painting is very detailed.

23:09.920 --> 23:13.190
-Take a look.
-Stop reading such a shameful book, Bo-ri.

23:13.290 --> 23:14.490
Look.

My goodness. They are having fun
with love but like this.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.130
-Are you sure?
-They are adorable.

You should just keep moving.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.970

I was talking to you, was I not?

24:39.310 --> 24:40.540
Look here?

How dare a servant...

24:44.180 --> 24:46.510
Oh, wait. Hold on.

24:46.950 --> 24:49.120
Were you not
begging for food earlier today?

24:49.180 --> 24:50.320
We are not beggars!

24:50.980 --> 24:52.120
Unbelievable.

24:52.890 --> 24:55.590
I told you to move along.
How dare you yell at me!

24:55.920 --> 24:58.230

-Lower your gaze.
-Do it, you fool.

The man of noble birth
will sort this matter out.

at Hanseong Magistracy

who means no harm to you.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.340
As if.

25:17.410 --> 25:19.450
You are not the first one from Hanyang

25:19.510 --> 25:22.950
to lie your way through this town
hoping to get free food.

25:23.180 --> 25:25.520
Do we hillbillies
seem like pushovers to you?

25:25.590 --> 25:27.790
Impersonating those of high rank

25:27.850 --> 25:30.820
will only lead you to a world of flogging
and other punishments.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.330
So live your life honestly.

Did I just get hit in the head?

I got hit even when I said
I was a chief clerk.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.220
My lord, we should just go.

-Pardon?

27:00.050 --> 27:02.620
Not, "please."

Just do not mind us.

27:08.290 --> 27:11.990
A chief clerk at the Hanseong Magistracy
means you are of high rank.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.690
You must have passed the state exam.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.360
Yes, of course.

I managed to pass the exam
on my first try.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.180

27:34.980 --> 27:37.550
-The highest score?
-That is correct.

[Sijae: The topic dealt in the state exam]

The topic...

27:53.370 --> 27:54.500
What was the topic again?

27:57.870 --> 28:00.110
Do you even know what "topic" means?

I knew you were lying beggars.

To those who have seen the ocean,

28:27.070 --> 28:28.470
Yes, of course!

28:28.540 --> 28:30.240
Mencius also spoke from the heart.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.870
It is all coming back to me.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.440
Educating you has been quite rewarding.

28:34.710 --> 28:36.210

30:12.510 --> 30:14.670
Bang-deuk, this is not your place.

30:14.740 --> 30:16.380
Why you little...

30:16.440 --> 30:18.180
How dare you!

30:19.350 --> 30:22.450
How dare you defy your master.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.290
Did I get hit again?

30:30.960 --> 30:33.030
Yes, you did. Run your mouth again,

30:33.090 --> 30:34.490
and I will hit you twice.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.260
Twice?

30:37.260 --> 30:38.400
But she did just hit me twice.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.030
My lord...

30:40.200 --> 30:42.800
Was I just hit on the mouth?

30:42.870 --> 30:44.900
Not even my grandmother hit my mouth.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.370
-So right here.
-Could you slow down?

30:47.510 --> 30:50.510
I would appreciate it
if you took a look from here to there.

30:50.580 --> 30:51.780
Here you go.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.280
How dare she lay a hand on me

30:54.350 --> 30:55.580
and go back to her business.

He is having another fit.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.830
-Gosh.
-My gosh.

31:06.890 --> 31:09.630
He must have a terrible disease.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.230
It sure is.
One moment he is fine, but the next...

31:17.170 --> 31:18.370
Could you...

31:19.410 --> 31:20.440
Thank you.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.810
Where are you, you little minx?

31:22.880 --> 31:24.740
Do you not know what time it is?

31:24.810 --> 31:27.850

cannot stay out this late.

Do you not care anymore?

31:31.680 --> 31:33.520
I am no longer your daughter-in-law

31:34.090 --> 31:37.120
-since I will soon be divorced.
-You sure are persistent

31:37.190 --> 31:39.760

up until this late hour?

It looks like I have leverage on you now.
Come on!

31:53.340 --> 31:55.040
-Mother!
-What is the meaning of this?

31:57.110 --> 32:00.710
This does not concern you,
so do not bother to speak with us.

at the Hanseong Magistracy.

32:09.190 --> 32:10.220
What?

32:10.290 --> 32:11.860
You heard him.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.230
He is the Chief Clerk
at the Hanseong Magistracy

32:14.330 --> 32:16.730
who is here to help me write
a petition for the trial.

32:18.030 --> 32:19.300
As if.

32:19.430 --> 32:23.840
How can a hillbilly like you
know a chief clerk?

32:24.100 --> 32:27.240
I caught you fooling around with men.

32:27.310 --> 32:30.410
That is why you are making
all sorts of excuses now.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.710
If he is a chief clerk,

32:32.780 --> 32:36.720
then I am the Queen! You little brat.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.820
He is truly--

32:37.880 --> 32:39.790
Hanseong Magistracy is
a law enforcement agency.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.660
It is one of the three legal agencies,
alongside the Board of Punishments

32:46.730 --> 32:49.360
and the Office of Inspector-General.
It mainly handles civil cases.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.830
It can investigate cases
in other regions, not just in Hanyang

32:53.900 --> 32:55.270
and give out punishments.

whether he is telling you the truth,

33:00.140 --> 33:01.370
suit yourself.

33:01.610 --> 33:03.880
However, this rudeness and insult

33:04.310 --> 33:06.510
will not be forgotten.

33:10.150 --> 33:12.250
Be quick.

33:13.650 --> 33:14.690
Okay?

33:25.830 --> 33:27.670
Why do you wish to be divorced?

with your own eyes.

just because of my mother-in-law.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.650
How should I put this?

33:40.110 --> 33:43.450
I just want to be happier than I am now.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.960
Gosh, I do not want to talk about it.
I will just get chewed out.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.500

34:01.070 --> 34:04.070
Well, about your friend, Bo-ri.

34:05.070 --> 34:06.310
Is she

34:07.710 --> 34:09.110
the woman who was found dead today?

34:09.480 --> 34:10.980
How do you know that?

34:11.040 --> 34:13.179
Well, we just happened to hear about it
on our way here.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.210
Purely by chance.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.320
She was like a little sister to me.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.389
She had agreed to testify for me
at my divorce trial.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.060
She said she would come by noon,

[Wu Shi: 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.]

34:27.130 --> 34:28.900
but she suddenly went to bathe.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.900
And she lost her footing.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.699
She had promised to come by noon
to be your witness?

34:36.770 --> 34:38.739
I swear. I know that
she would never break a promise,

34:39.110 --> 34:40.210
so I do not understand.

well over two hours.]

to break her promise,]

You know, your friend Bo-ri.
Could she have had another reason?

35:11.300 --> 35:12.440
Maybe she was being bullied.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.570
No. That is impossible.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.180
She was such a great cook,

35:16.240 --> 35:18.340
and everyone in the village
was very fond of her.

if she left anything behind?

35:23.780 --> 35:24.780

No, nothing. I burned everything.

-That is evidence--
-She needs to take

35:42.840 --> 35:44.440
all her belongings with her

for an investigation]

1:03:00.810 --> 1:03:02.470
-and confiscate the seal!
-Yes, sir!

1:03:02.540 --> 1:03:04.040
Confiscate the seal?

1:03:04.110 --> 1:03:05.710
My petition has not been sealed yet.

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:08.910
How dare you!
Who dares to raise their head?

1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:12.150
They cannot take the seal.

1:03:12.950 --> 1:03:15.220
Jang Ki-wan shall be imprisoned at once.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:19.420
No one can enter the premises
until the investigation is over!

1:03:19.790 --> 1:03:21.190
I object!

1:03:27.130 --> 1:03:29.800
You are that rude, aggressive...

1:03:29.870 --> 1:03:31.100
You are Bang-deuk!

1:03:36.310 --> 1:03:39.310
Royal Inspector, sir.

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.210
I was just...

1:03:43.010 --> 1:03:44.350
I must have been out of my mind.

1:03:44.420 --> 1:03:46.350
I really thought you were a beggar.

1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:50.290
I mean, you looked dirt-poor
and title-less, so I thought...

1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:54.830
In any case, I am truly sorry
for my brazenness.

1:03:54.890 --> 1:03:56.790
-Royal Inspector, sir!
-Mother!

1:03:57.090 --> 1:04:00.530
Please just go ahead
and imprison this wench too.

1:04:01.930 --> 1:04:04.170
This is void!

1:04:08.070 --> 1:04:11.740
The magistrate cannot even stamp
his seal on this now.

1:04:14.210 --> 1:04:16.210
There you go. Take this and get lost.

1:04:19.550 --> 1:04:23.120
You came at the perfect time.

1:04:23.190 --> 1:04:26.360
I wish you a long, healthy life.

1:04:26.620 --> 1:04:29.860
Then we shall return to our home.

1:04:31.030 --> 1:04:32.600
Come here, you brat.

1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:34.730
Your impudence knows no bounds.

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:38.340
Let her go.

1:04:38.970 --> 1:04:42.010
How dare you use violence
in a government office?

1:04:48.210 --> 1:04:50.350
I hope I did not come too late.

1:04:56.320 --> 1:04:57.860
[To the magistrate of Gyehwa Valley]

1:05:04.660 --> 1:05:07.700
Jang Ki-wan, the magistrate of Gyehwa,
is under arrest for a grave crime.

1:05:09.030 --> 1:05:12.670
However, he has already approved
Kim Jo-yi's divorce request.

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:15.570
Ergo, I, the royal inspector
of Left Chungcheong Province,

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.240
hereby announce that as of today,
the lunar date of May 5...

1:05:32.090 --> 1:05:33.260
Your divorce

1:05:35.060 --> 1:05:36.160
is approved.

1:06:04.020 --> 1:06:05.690
[No animals were harmed
during the filming.]

1:06:14.830 --> 1:06:17.540
[Local Government Office]

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:19.470
[We thank Song Jong-ho
for his special appearance.]

1:06:22.010 --> 1:06:24.680
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

1:06:24.910 --> 1:06:27.350
[I will no longer live with regret.]

1:06:27.410 --> 1:06:30.780
[Before words spread about
a secret royal inspector in the region,]

1:06:30.850 --> 1:06:32.450
I will find out who is behind this.

1:06:32.550 --> 1:06:34.220
[You should have prevented him
from sending another inspector.]

1:06:34.290 --> 1:06:35.890
[We will just kill them all.]

1:06:35.950 --> 1:06:38.960
[To protect what you cherish,
you must put up with things you dislike.]

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.830
[It could also mean poison.]

1:06:40.890 --> 1:06:43.090
[Coming here was a great move.]

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:45.160
[Why would we meet again?]

1:06:45.300 --> 1:06:47.230
[I told you to take care of it!]

1:06:47.300 --> 1:06:50.330
[You helped me get my life back.]

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:51.870
[You made it happen on your own,]

1:06:51.940 --> 1:06:53.070
[with your courage.]
