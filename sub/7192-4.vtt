WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:04.421
- When we find the girls,
we're out of here.

00:04.504 --> 00:05.755
- Jax, no.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.090
We can't leave
until I get Daniel

00:07.173 --> 00:08.633
to remember who
he really is.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.592
- Come on, Emma.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.094
Can't you see?

00:11.177 --> 00:13.471
Whoever he is,
he's happy here.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.766
Why can't you just
accept that and move on?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.017
- Because he's not himself.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.271
So we don't know
if he's happy.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.565
I'm sorry,
but this is my fault.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.108
I can't "move on"
until I make it right.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.776
- I guess if that's
your choice...

00:26.860 --> 00:29.863
- But it wasn't, Jax.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.698
I chose you, I just...

00:32.782 --> 00:33.074
can't leave him.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.790
- Emma, I...I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:40.874 --> 00:42.959
Okay, I've tried to
be a good boyfriend, I have.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.794
But I have to draw the line.

00:47.130 --> 00:52.010
I'm leaving...
with or without you.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.765
Fine.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.975
Without you it is.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.102
- No! Jax, wait!

01:01.186 --> 01:02.645
You can't teletransport.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.938
The storm is almost here.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.108
Your hair will
get all spiky.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.360
Please.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.862
I did this.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.822
Changed someone's
entire reality.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.241
I need to make things right.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.539
- Oh! I think
I'm getting something!

01:21.623 --> 01:23.416
[screaming]

01:24.542 --> 01:26.085
No!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.504
- Well?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.005
- I recognize this kind of trap!

01:29.088 --> 01:30.673
Beau told me all about
how he and his friends

01:30.757 --> 01:31.883
always try to avoid them.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.468
- And did he tell you
how to get out of one?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.469
- Yes!

01:34.552 --> 01:35.011
- Well?

01:35.094 --> 01:35.678
- Oh, yeah!

01:35.762 --> 01:38.765
Lemme just see here...

01:38.848 --> 01:41.768
- [panicked panting]

01:41.851 --> 01:43.102
You'll be fine, I...

01:43.186 --> 01:46.147
I just have to
wash the mud off of you

01:46.231 --> 01:48.149
and stick you in a vat
of rice overnight.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.234
[metal groaning and banging]

01:49.317 --> 01:50.527
What?!

01:50.610 --> 01:52.111
- Well... at least
I got it open!

01:54.906 --> 01:56.533
- Thank you for staying.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.867
- I wouldn't be doing this
for anyone else.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.119
- What's taking Daniel so long?

02:00.203 --> 02:02.580
- All right, that's it, I'm
gonna look for 'em, I can't...

02:02.664 --> 02:05.291
- My Proxy, my hero.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.459
- By yourself?

02:06.543 --> 02:07.502
You can't drive an airboat.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.670
You could barely drive
the bumper cars

02:09.753 --> 02:11.089
at the carnival last week.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.842
- Mine had a wonky wheel.
- It's a bad idea, mate.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.219
- Yeah, we should wait for
Daniel and that expert guide.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.762
They know what
they're doing.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.597
- It's my sister;
I can't just let her be eaten

02:19.681 --> 02:21.850
by lions and tigers
and bears!

02:21.933 --> 02:25.103
- Don't worry, no lions, tigers,
or bears in the 'glades.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.563
- Guys, this the guide
I was talking about.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.856
- Mia?

03:03.182 --> 03:04.642
{\an8}- We all do.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.895
{\an8}- Was she lost out there too?

03:06.978 --> 03:08.521
{\an8}Maybe she's dehydrated.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.109
- Or maybe she just looks
very familiar, right?

03:13.192 --> 03:15.320
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no, she looks
just like Mia,

03:15.403 --> 03:19.949
the superstar equestrian
girl at our school.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.034
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.911
- Oh, so they both
have the same names?

03:22.994 --> 03:24.120
That's quite a coincidence.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.580
- Can we look for
my sister, please?

03:25.663 --> 03:27.290
- Yes, Mia's the guide I was
talking about.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.958
She knows the area like
the back of her hand.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.628
- [sighing]
I hope Gigi's okay.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.546
- Proxy! Your markings!

03:33.630 --> 03:35.381
Calm down.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.760
Just calm down.
- [exhaling]

03:38.843 --> 03:40.428
- All right,
so Mia and I will head off

03:40.511 --> 03:41.721
as soon as we finish
loading up.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.056
- I'm coming with.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.475
- I don't know if
that's a good idea.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.226
- It's dangerous.
- Well, so are we.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.812
- What? Diego and Maddie
are going and not me?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.189
I don't think so!

03:53.066 --> 03:54.609
- That's sweet that they want
to rescue their friends.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.154
But, yeah, we can't take them.
- No.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.081
[zapping]

04:09.165 --> 04:12.627
- I don't see
an animal sanctuary.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.963
You transported us
to the wrong location.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.839
- I think the incoming storm
threw off my telenavigation.

04:17.923 --> 04:18.841
- [gasps]

04:18.925 --> 04:19.968
Speaking of which...

04:20.051 --> 04:21.719
[grunts]

04:21.803 --> 04:23.346
Setting the storm-timer

04:23.429 --> 04:25.932
to five minutes
before the latest time

04:26.015 --> 04:29.394
such that the maximum allotted
risk is minimized.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.312
[laughing]

04:31.396 --> 04:34.524
- Are you sure you even know
how to work that thing?

04:34.607 --> 04:35.191
- Of course.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.276
Now we better get going.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.862
If there is a Continuum Break,

04:39.946 --> 04:41.239
we must get
to the bottom of it.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.575
- Don't like any
of this, Agamemnon.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.035
- Neither do I.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.038
The Chosen One
<i>is</i> getting reckless.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.581
- It's like she
doesn't understand

04:50.665 --> 04:53.418
that she can't go re-arranging
the Universe to her liking.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.460
- Agreed.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.879
What do we do if there
is a Continuum--

04:56.963 --> 04:59.549
- Well, we tell her to not
speak to that human.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.259
The world and the Realm
are fine as is.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.470
We can't risk another shift.
- Ah.

05:06.973 --> 05:07.974
Oh!

05:08.808 --> 05:09.976
- You don't remember her?

05:10.059 --> 05:12.103
Mia and I got stuck in
<i>Zombie Apocalypse Three</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:13.479
after I made Phillip human.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.731
- Phillip's human?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.107
- What?

05:16.190 --> 05:17.650
Yes, isn't he?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.068
- Ah, gotcha.
[laughing]

05:19.152 --> 05:21.988
- Not the time.
- Sorry.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.950
- Yeah, all that happened,
but...not with her.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.326
- You mean there's another...

05:27.410 --> 05:30.038
Because in the other reality,
Mia--

05:30.121 --> 05:32.582
- Hey, hey, we'll figure
that one out later.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.501
But for now, let's just figure
out where these girls are.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.212
- I still can't believe--
- Whoa, dude!

05:38.296 --> 05:39.380
- zBe careful!

05:39.464 --> 05:40.923
You can't let anyone
else see those.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.717
- [exhaling]

05:42.800 --> 05:46.387
I still can't believe that
you left them out in the swamp.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.264
- All right, you know what,
I told them

05:48.347 --> 05:49.724
to stay with the boat
and they didn't listen.

05:49.807 --> 05:53.519
So can we just teletransport
to them and bring them back?

05:53.603 --> 05:54.645
- Not in this kind
of weather.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.106
Unless you want
a toasted Maddie or Jax.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.275
- Oh!
- What about a locator spell?

05:59.358 --> 06:02.528
- It still involves
teletransporting.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.740
- But we could use a...
BOTH: Map locating spell.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.699
- I said it first, jinx!
- I said it first, jinx!

06:06.783 --> 06:09.577
- Good idea.
Let's try it.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.413
- We can use this map.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.290
- I'll do it.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.541
Before we hear the thunder clap,

06:15.625 --> 06:17.877
show Katie, Sophie,
and Gigi on this map.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.047
- We found them!

06:22.548 --> 06:24.425
- We're coming
for you, Panthers!

06:24.509 --> 06:24.550
- And Gigi!

06:28.346 --> 06:32.058
- Oh, it's so beautiful here.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.852
- Aw, well, it's not fancy,
but it is home.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.854
- So how long have you lived
at the Everglades?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.066
- Well, 18 years.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.234
The kids were
all born here.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.985
- [chuckling]

06:43.069 --> 06:45.530
- Hey, baby.
There you go, sweetie.

06:45.613 --> 06:49.325
- Uh, hey, wasn't there
some super cool insect exhibit

06:49.408 --> 06:51.869
that you wanted to show me--
- Hi, can I help you?

06:53.204 --> 06:54.455
Excuse me?

06:54.539 --> 06:57.333
- Uh, they're just tourists...

06:57.416 --> 06:59.210
from a faraway country.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.419
- Lily!

07:00.503 --> 07:02.713
There you are.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.674
- Hi, Desi,

07:04.757 --> 07:06.801
this is Cristina Miller.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.719
She runs
the animal sanctuary.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.263
- [mouthing silently]

07:10.346 --> 07:11.806
- Are you here for a tour?

07:11.889 --> 07:13.850
- Oh!

07:13.933 --> 07:17.186
Yes, a tour
of this theme park.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.563
- Oh, no, we are not a theme--

07:20.481 --> 07:22.358
- Why did you do that?

07:22.441 --> 07:25.444
- All these social niceties were
getting hard to follow.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.364
We don't have time.
There is a storm a-brewing.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.950
- So, you think this
is a Continuum Break?

07:31.033 --> 07:31.784
- I do.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.703
But I'm taking care of it!

07:33.786 --> 07:36.038
- Your closeness with the Chosen
One is clouding your judgment.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.416
- What? How?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.543
- You can't see that
her out-of-control behavior

07:40.626 --> 07:44.714
will lead to
something... terrible.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.884
- Well, you don't know
that for sure.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.302
- Boats are ready.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.761
We better get moving if we're
going to beat the storm.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.889
- Good news.
We know where they are.

07:52.972 --> 07:53.973
MADDIE: Mm-hmm.
- Really?

07:54.056 --> 07:56.017
Nice!

07:57.727 --> 07:58.644
How do you know
they're there?

08:02.440 --> 08:05.651
- [stammering]
Uh, uh...

08:05.735 --> 08:08.112
Um, Ma--Maddie found them
on her phone; she has an app.

08:08.196 --> 08:08.905
- Yeah!

08:08.988 --> 08:10.156
I used "Find My iPanther."

08:10.239 --> 08:13.367
- Uh, yeah, they have locations
on all the Panthers.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.204
- And we got some signal
from Katie's phone.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.539
- For just a second.
- That's great!

08:18.623 --> 08:21.542
It'll save us
a lot of time.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.920
- Phew.
- Good save.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.755
- That wasn't a save.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.881
It's true.
- Hm?

08:26.964 --> 08:27.673
- What? Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.429
- You, you know you're on here
too, right?

08:33.511 --> 08:33.596
- Duh.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.433
- Shouldn't be too hard
to find them.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.102
- Are there a lot
of wild animals there?

08:40.186 --> 08:40.852
- Some.

08:40.937 --> 08:41.854
- [grunting]
Gigi!

08:41.938 --> 08:43.688
- Diego!

08:47.526 --> 08:48.611
- Is something burning?

08:48.694 --> 08:49.820
- No, I don't--
- No!

08:49.904 --> 08:50.529
- What?
- Yeah, it's me, it's me.

08:53.032 --> 08:53.950
- Oh!

08:54.033 --> 08:55.201
I have an idea.

08:55.284 --> 08:55.534
Katie, hand me your phone.

08:58.871 --> 09:02.291
This is Miss Information
with a special report:

09:02.375 --> 09:04.252
"Panthers Get Caught in a Trap!"

09:04.335 --> 09:06.671
- No! I can't be seen
on your blog like this.

09:06.754 --> 09:10.258

19:08.480 --> 19:11.358
You're with Jax so... maybe
you should just leave it be.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.409
[thunder crashing]

19:21.201 --> 19:24.163
- Thank you so much, Proxy.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.957
It was so sweet of you to go out
into that tycoon for me.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.793
- Typhoo-- never mind.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.503
My pleasure.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.672
- Um, I asked you to get
the 24-inch carry-on.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.508
This is the 22-inch.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.926
- I didn't have a ruler.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.304
- Do you mind going out again?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.346
- What?!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.432
- Please, Proxy?

19:45.225 --> 19:46.393
- [laughing]

19:50.188 --> 19:53.942
Look, Madd,
it's a Kanay marking.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.402
- But I thought you were
the only Kanay.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.487
- Yeah, I thought so too, but
then there was a Kanay marking

19:57.571 --> 20:01.116
in the other display and...
and now this one.

20:01.199 --> 20:01.825
- What do you think it means?

20:01.909 --> 20:05.120
- That at one point,

20:05.203 --> 20:06.413
there were Kanays around here!

20:16.840 --> 20:19.760
- Uh-oh, Daniel gave Emma
some water!

20:19.843 --> 20:21.345
[gasping]

20:21.428 --> 20:23.305
Hey, it doesn't mean anything.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.723
She chose you, remember?

20:24.806 --> 20:28.185
- But I remember her choosing me
over the Council, not him.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.646
- Yeah, me too.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.190
Look, I'm only gonna
say this once.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.358
Emma's nuts about <i>you.</i>

20:34.441 --> 20:38.153
In this reality,
her reality, wherever.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.446
- How do you know that?

20:39.529 --> 20:42.324
- Because I know Emma.
And so do you.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.617
Which is why
we should trust

20:43.700 --> 20:45.577
that whatever she's doing,
she has to do.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.578
- You're right.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.372
I've been
an insecure jerk.

20:48.455 --> 20:48.956
- No, you haven't.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.249
Not insecure.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.919
- I should make it up to her.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.337
- That's the spirit!

20:55.420 --> 20:58.423
- In two minutes, get Emma to
meet me in the other room.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.218
Okay?
Two minutes.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.429
- Ugh, it's so weird when we're
on the same side of stuff.

21:08.058 --> 21:08.850
- It's ready.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.102
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.400
- What's the matter?

21:16.483 --> 21:19.361
- Uh... what isn't the matter?

21:19.444 --> 21:20.362
- Huh?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.363
- You know.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.739
You know what's
the matter.

21:24.241 --> 21:24.866
- Where's Jax?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.494
We should wait for him.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.414
- I think he's in
the other room.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.498
- I better go get him.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.126
- I'll come with you.
[giggling]

21:34.209 --> 21:36.003
- Uh-oh.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.509
- Wait, you're not gonna tell me
what's the... matter?

21:48.765 --> 21:49.725
- Surprise!

21:49.808 --> 21:52.269
[zapping]
