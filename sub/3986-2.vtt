WEBVTT

00:09.134 --> 00:10.715
You know how that go, right?

00:11.040 --> 00:14.872
Gave myself all these little rules
about what I wouldn't do.

00:15.588 --> 00:18.512
Like, I told myself I'd do
a lot of shit to get high,

00:18.945 --> 00:21.660
but I swore I wouldn't
never trick.

00:23.715 --> 00:24.964
So after I'm trickin'...

00:25.642 --> 00:27.378
I thought,
"well, this ain't so bad.

00:27.538 --> 00:30.145
"I'll do this for a while 'cept
I'll make some more rules for myself.

00:30.305 --> 00:32.360
"like I'm gonna use condoms,

00:32.879 --> 00:34.285
"and I'm never gonna go

00:34.445 --> 00:36.686
with more than one guy
at the same time," and,

00:39.003 --> 00:42.847
let's just say there are certain things
I told myself I wouldn't never do.

00:44.499 --> 00:47.009
You know what my disease
did to my rules, right?

00:51.180 --> 00:54.297
Whatever it is you tell yourself
you won't do to get high,

00:55.085 --> 00:56.753
you're pretty much making a list

00:56.963 --> 00:59.724
of everything you will do as soon as
your inner addict tells you to.

01:00.412 --> 01:03.224
I mean,
that bitch wants to kill me.

01:06.213 --> 01:07.331
She does.

01:08.746 --> 01:11.931
Even on my way here today,
she was telling me not to come.

01:12.448 --> 01:16.308
She was tellin' me that I was all right
on the street, that it was all good.

01:22.753 --> 01:24.160
I'm about done.

01:26.052 --> 01:28.151
I want to thank you all
for letting me share.

01:28.251 --> 01:29.217
Amen.

01:35.031 --> 01:36.560
Thanks for sharing, Dee-Dee.

01:36.908 --> 01:38.186
Always lift us.

01:42.232 --> 01:46.147
We got finished a little early.
Anybody else feel like sharing?

01:48.963 --> 01:51.508
How 'bout you, Bubs?
Haven't heard from you in a while.

01:51.668 --> 01:52.883
Bubbles.

01:53.382 --> 01:54.465
Get up there!

01:55.534 --> 01:56.876
Come on, bubs.

02:01.218 --> 02:02.518
All right, bubbles.

02:07.501 --> 02:08.649
Hi, y'all.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.862
- You know who I am.
- Hey, bubs.

02:12.722 --> 02:14.952
- Bubs. Bubbles.
- What's up, Bubbles?

02:15.537 --> 02:17.075
I'm a grateful addict.

02:19.952 --> 02:22.336
Been clean 15
months thursday.

02:26.206 --> 02:28.275
This is the
longest I been off.

02:31.763 --> 02:32.696
I...

02:35.923 --> 02:37.331
Hey, yo! Let's go!

02:39.658 --> 02:41.252
I used to get so high, you know.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.308
I mean,
I used to love to be high.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.487
Y'all see me out there
on Monroe and Fayette

02:46.647 --> 02:48.566
doin' the dope-fiend lean, right?

02:48.727 --> 02:50.157
Be like this here.

02:52.211 --> 02:55.504
I come out of it,
get a little more upright.

02:56.587 --> 02:58.609
Come to realize people
treatin' me like a lamp post,

02:59.078 --> 03:00.957
hangin' fliers on me an' shit.

03:02.673 --> 03:06.181
Come winter, little kids hangin'
Christmas balls on me like a damn tree.

03:06.712 --> 03:08.611
Summertime,
they'd walk me over that garden,

03:08.770 --> 03:10.894
where the nine-oh-nine used to be.
Make me...

03:11.955 --> 03:13.471
Make me a scarecrow.

03:20.371 --> 03:22.883
Yeah.
I used to love to get high.

03:30.406 --> 03:31.988
Got to the point...

03:37.622 --> 03:41.091
You know, I'm not in the right place
to talk about this right now.

03:41.897 --> 03:43.480
Keep comin' back, Bubs.

03:48.765 --> 03:49.809
Thanks, bubs.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.556
Thanks for sharing.

03:51.716 --> 03:55.659
Is there anybodylse
with  a burning desire to share?

03:58.226 --> 03:59.244
Marvin?

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:51.442 --> 05:53.023
It's quiet up in here.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.113
You got the,
Bank of America accounts?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.785
That pile there.

06:09.184 --> 06:12.714
So he claims to be raising money

06:13.050 --> 06:16.065
for some basketball program
or day-care center...

06:16.425 --> 06:18.978
And the money comes in,
and the money goes out.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.448
But no hoops, no day care.

06:22.791 --> 06:24.981
Ok, so say we get Clay Davis,

06:26.060 --> 06:28.205
- and say he flips...
- Then he takes us up the ladder.

06:28.549 --> 06:31.251
To who? I mean, if Clay
is stealing from his own nonprofits...

06:31.411 --> 06:34.219
That's an easy case for us to  make
with all the paperwork we got here.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.658
That's a straight-up theft,
maybe a tax charge or two,

06:38.119 --> 06:41.391
but there's money
that all this paperwork only hints at,

06:41.552 --> 06:44.392
money that doesn't show up
on a campaign finance report.

06:44.553 --> 06:47.823
My guess is that Clay Davis
knows about that, too.

06:47.982 --> 06:49.188
I don't know, man.

06:49.349 --> 06:50.733
I like street work more.

06:51.086 --> 06:53.914
You'd rather sit in a surveillance van
days on end

06:54.074 --> 06:56.866
waiting to catch Tater
handing Pee Wee a vial?

06:57.316 --> 06:59.556
This, detective,
is what you're telling me?

06:59.907 --> 07:01.371
A case like this here,

07:02.657 --> 07:04.167
where you show who gets paid

07:04.326 --> 07:07.010
behind all the tragedy
and the fraud,

07:08.111 --> 07:09.589
where you show how the money

07:10.062 --> 07:13.652
routes itself,
how we're all, all of us vested,

07:13.813 --> 07:15.308
all of us complicit?

07:17.652 --> 07:18.994
Career case, huh?

07:20.176 --> 07:23.490
Baby, I could die happy.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.147
Still, man,

07:27.404 --> 07:30.343
I wonder what Marlo
is up to right fucking now.

07:33.594 --> 07:34.785
Celebrating.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.619
Yeah, but they still taking pictures?

07:37.779 --> 07:40.564
No.
I ain't feel nothing in a while

07:40.724 --> 07:43.505
we took care that thing
over the eastside. They ain't on me.

07:43.732 --> 07:45.659
Snoop, she been rolling around all week.

07:45.820 --> 07:48.303
Nothing, no cars, no vans,
no helicopters.

07:48.463 --> 07:50.734
Monk-- he checked after the re-up,
no problem.

07:51.324 --> 07:52.334
We wore 'em down.

07:52.494 --> 07:53.643
What about cameras?

07:53.804 --> 07:56.938
Nothing since the camera
we took out the wall back at the place.

07:57.099 --> 07:59.642
My overnight man, he been watchin',
he ain't seen nothing either.

07:59.802 --> 08:02.487
'sides, I think we good as long as
we move it around like this.

08:02.848 --> 08:04.581
Back to bidness, I say.

08:05.516 --> 08:07.139
She ain't had no work in a few months.

08:07.299 --> 08:08.544
She somewhat eager.

08:08.703 --> 08:10.096
Goddamn right.

08:10.255 --> 08:13.130
Too much fuckin'
talkin' around here lately, man.

08:13.289 --> 08:15.419
Niggas need to shut the fuck up.
For real.

08:15.756 --> 08:16.962
A-ight, first thing.

08:17.252 --> 08:18.912
We go hard at webster Franklin's crew.

08:19.072 --> 08:21.761
Gave 'em the chance
to get on our tit, passed.

08:22.465 --> 08:24.947
Now we bang on his corners
a couple of times 'til he fold.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.100
- Now you talkin'.
- Yeah.

08:27.261 --> 08:30.475
Next, we step to June bug
for talkin' that shit.

08:30.930 --> 08:32.866
He was a dead man
when he opened his mouth.

08:33.025 --> 08:35.126
He just walkin' around
not knowing it.

08:36.772 --> 08:38.397
You know, an' I
want that dicksucker.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.304
Took my money
and the whole world know.

08:42.015 --> 08:43.518
Naw. He got to fall.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.324
Omar rolled out
in retirement and shit.

08:46.779 --> 08:48.158
I'm hearin' somewheresSouth.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.169
Bring his ass back
out of retirement.

08:51.905 --> 08:53.545
- A-ight.
- Yeah, a-ight.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.453
We can step that shit up,

08:55.613 --> 08:57.885
but he's goin' to be comin'
at us like we comin' at him.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.981
I mean, Joe and them,
they said let that be.

09:00.192 --> 09:02.088
No crown ain't worth much

09:02.413 --> 09:05.272
if the nigga wearin' it
always gettin' his shit took,

09:05.663 --> 09:07.452
and Joe ought to know that.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.548
Let him come. Yeah.

09:12.003 --> 09:13.736
What up with that
thing down at Jessup?

09:13.896 --> 09:15.998
Yeah, yeah. You on the list.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.181
Go on down there anytime you want.

09:19.342 --> 09:21.166
No problem.
That's the dude right there.

09:23.198 --> 09:24.234
A-right.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.903
Time for y'all
to earn your pay, niggas.

09:43.130 --> 09:45.015
Funny how you started out.

09:46.271 --> 09:48.866
- What you mean?
- Dope-fiend lean and all.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.596
Why didn't you keep going?

09:54.609 --> 09:57.664
You know, you hear a lot
of funny shit in these rooms,

09:58.971 --> 10:02.287
people makin' fun of their mistakes,
makin' people laugh,

10:03.697 --> 10:05.647
but in between all the jokes,

10:06.628 --> 10:08.666
there's a lot of truth to be spoke.

10:09.938 --> 10:11.282
Like that girl today.

10:11.442 --> 10:13.363
She damn near bled out, didn't she?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.531
You know, for a second there,

10:16.690 --> 10:20.272
I thought you might actually stand up
and talk about Sherrod.

10:20.844 --> 10:23.300
"a searching and
fearless moral inventory."

10:23.459 --> 10:25.398
- That's the step.
- Don't tell me about that.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.633
I live with that
every fuckin' day, man.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.474
You got to let it out to let it go.

10:31.251 --> 10:34.255
I'm your sponsor, and I'm telling you,
you got to get it out of your head,

10:34.414 --> 10:36.332
- outside yourself.
- I never missed a meeting.

10:36.492 --> 10:40.029
I'm not talking about the meetings.
I'm talking about where you go after.

10:40.189 --> 10:42.461
I'm talking about what you do,

10:42.621 --> 10:44.994
what you think,
what you feel.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.238
I don't feel nothing.

10:47.811 --> 10:49.815
That was never your problem.

10:49.975 --> 10:52.210
Not even as a low-bottom
dope fiend, that

10:52.370 --> 10:53.556
was never the problem.

10:53.715 --> 10:56.782
It would be a fuckin' shame
to make it the problem now.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.665
So Carcetti threw us a bone, huh?

11:02.826 --> 11:04.582
Took the cap off
secondary employment.

11:04.937 --> 11:08.216
Yeah. Even I may have
to go out and find honest work.

11:09.011 --> 11:11.230
There's no money to be made
in this policing shit.

11:11.389 --> 11:12.917
They made that clear enough.

11:13.804 --> 11:15.221
What are you
qualified to do?

11:17.623 --> 11:18.849
Aside from that, I mean.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.144
You know I got an in
on the eight-to-four gig over

11:21.305 --> 11:22.603
at Friedman's jewelry,

11:22.764 --> 11:24.261
you know, off of Reisterstown.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.525
Yeah, 20 an hour.

11:26.898 --> 11:29.102
Stand around
with some shiny shit and get paid.

11:29.263 --> 11:32.660
Work murders and starve.
Fuck kind of shit is that?

11:32.919 --> 11:34.946
Anything from
overnight or this morning?

11:35.106 --> 11:36.647
Yeah, midnight shift caught one.

11:37.493 --> 11:38.400
Solved?

11:38.560 --> 11:41.753
Open.
Bar cutting from Curtis bay.

11:42.176 --> 11:43.779
Fahlteich's over at the morgue now.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.282
Slow night.

11:45.628 --> 11:47.644
Oh, I'm sure things
will be picking up

11:47.803 --> 11:49.930
now we're no longer
sitting on Marlo Stanfield.

11:51.726 --> 11:54.392
It wasn't my call to suspend
the investigation, Jimmy.

11:54.551 --> 11:56.382
That decision came
from your shop.

11:57.186 --> 11:59.794
Yeah, but nobody from the S.A.'s
office objected, did they?

11:59.954 --> 12:02.855
Just like nobody objected
when Chris and Snoop got their gun

12:03.020 --> 12:04.777
charges postponed
a couple of times.

12:04.938 --> 12:08.661
A postponement or two is pro forma
on Calvert Street. You know that.

12:09.281 --> 12:11.913
"Pro forma" from the Latin,

12:12.074 --> 12:14.310
meaning the lawyers
jacking each other off.

12:14.471 --> 12:15.828
Rules are the rules, Jimmy.

12:16.095 --> 12:17.629
There are no fucking rules.

12:19.185 --> 12:20.746
Fucking game's rigged.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.454
Gentlemen.

12:29.693 --> 12:31.745
Why the fuck chew
on ronnie's arm, huh?

12:32.265 --> 12:33.566
She ain't the problem.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.903
Tired of being jerked around.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.505
I think I'm gonna get me
a secondary job

12:40.665 --> 12:42.670
at that high-end cigar shop
on Baltimore street.

12:42.904 --> 12:44.287
- As what?
- Homicide.

12:44.447 --> 12:45.830
The Indian out front?

12:45.991 --> 12:48.292
I'd like to scalp your ass,motherfucker.

12:48.676 --> 12:49.671
Got it.

12:50.124 --> 12:51.206
Who's up?

12:54.947 --> 12:55.922
There you go,

12:56.241 --> 12:58.680
givin' a fuck when it ain't your turn
to give a fuck.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.267
He's a pissy
little bitch today.

13:02.973 --> 13:04.649
I'm worried for the boy.

14:32.361 --> 14:34.594
Some good news for a change
as the test scores

14:34.754 --> 14:37.091
for third-graders going up
a good 15 points.

14:37.338 --> 14:40.428
- That's what I get for 54 million?
- You can run on that.

14:40.675 --> 14:42.764
15 points is a nice,
solid number.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.370
Whatever bump in the test scores I get,
I got to run on it.

14:45.529 --> 14:47.946
I sure as hell can't campaign
on the crime rate at this point.

14:48.106 --> 14:50.607
Burrell already told us
we don't have a double-digit decline.

14:50.768 --> 14:52.190
A small drop, most likely.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.058
Until we take back
the statehouse,

14:54.158 --> 14:56.247
this city will starve.
I get to Annapolis,

14:56.407 --> 15:00.293
and whoever I leave behind as mayor,
Bond, Campbell, or who knows...

15:00.454 --> 15:03.253
- They gonna have a better time of it.
- It's not gonna be Nerese

15:03.413 --> 15:05.751
<i>if she's goin' like she has.
Sun papers made her look bad.</i>

15:05.993 --> 15:08.186
Yeah.
She tells me this real estate flip

15:08.347 --> 15:10.340
was a holdover
from the last administration.

15:10.622 --> 15:13.552
True as far as it goes,
but she got herself paid as well.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.633
She looked bad enough
that it'll cost you votes,

15:15.792 --> 15:17.552
people who don't want
to make you governor

15:17.712 --> 15:19.645
if that means
Nerese finishes your term as Mayor.

15:19.805 --> 15:21.046
She makes you vulnerable.

15:21.206 --> 15:23.606
What, can I ask,
makes the governor vulnerable?

15:23.881 --> 15:26.526
He looked like a petulant little bitch
with that diatribe on olesker.

15:26.685 --> 15:28.005
He looked paranoid, too.

15:28.165 --> 15:29.798
What about his
failure on slots?

15:29.959 --> 15:32.012
With a democratic assembly,
everyone expects a G.O.P.

15:32.172 --> 15:33.549
Governor will take his lumps.

15:33.710 --> 15:37.020
Besides, voters are split
on legalizing slots.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.547
It has to hit him directly.

15:42.586 --> 15:45.849
Well, I'll see what's on the mind
of the P.G. County boys tonight.

15:46.019 --> 15:47.809
I got dinner with Stenny Miller,
and Maloney

15:47.970 --> 15:49.728
down in upper Marlboro,
which reminds me...

15:49.888 --> 15:51.209
You're late to meet jen.

16:00.134 --> 16:02.012
Doesn't this seem a little thin to you,

16:02.215 --> 16:05.241
running for governor
2 years into a 4-year term?

16:05.656 --> 16:06.825
Everything's thin.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.871
The whole world shines shit
and calls it gold.

16:15.609 --> 16:18.842
So Somerville, he keeps going back
to ask Tommy the elder follow-ups?

16:18.976 --> 16:20.329
One question after another

16:20.488 --> 16:21.956
his editor wants him to ask him.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.190
Somerville,
knocking on big Tommy's door,

16:25.350 --> 16:26.803
blaming the city desk,

16:26.963 --> 16:30.517
saying, "I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr.Mayor, but my desk wants to know."

16:30.677 --> 16:33.186
- Shit, I see it coming.
- So 3 or 4 times, right?

16:33.346 --> 16:35.613
"my desk is wondering--
I'm sorry to bother you,

16:37.041 --> 16:39.590
Mr. Mayor, but my desk wants to know."
So finally,

16:39.888 --> 16:41.019
Tommy d'Alesandro,

16:41.179 --> 16:43.972
he puts his ear down to his desk
like this, and he says...

16:45.168 --> 16:47.207
"my desk tells your desk
to go fuck itself."

16:49.262 --> 16:50.335
That really happen?

16:50.496 --> 16:52.172
Too good a story to check out.

16:53.326 --> 16:56.724
What's my favorite G.A. reporter
have today for his favorite editor?

16:57.169 --> 16:58.824
Heartbreaker from eastside.

16:59.530 --> 17:01.419
Salt-of-the-earth single mother of 4

17:01.578 --> 17:04.026
dies from allergic reaction
to blue crabs.

17:04.396 --> 17:07.522
Ate them all her life but goes
face down in a lump backfin

17:07.758 --> 17:09.567
pronounced an hour later at Hopkins,

17:09.842 --> 17:12.189
and sister is starting
a scholarship fund for the kids.

17:12.349 --> 17:13.684
Interviewed the whole family.

17:13.844 --> 17:15.329
- Photos, the works.
-Attaboy.

17:15.488 --> 17:17.285
Round it out with some,
some medical stuff

17:17.444 --> 17:18.977
on seafood toxicity, huh?

17:19.137 --> 17:20.915
Growing incidence,
all that good shit.

17:21.076 --> 17:22.420
All right, cool.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.191
You ever notice how mother
of 4 is always catching hell?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.124
Murder, hit-and-run,
burn up in row house fire,

17:32.574 --> 17:35.224
- swindled by bigamists.
- Tough gig, mother of 4.

17:35.515 --> 17:38.665
Innocent bystander is worse.
He's always getting the short end.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.881
Not a lot of them around anymore.

17:41.336 --> 17:43.201
Not a lot of innocence either,
you ask me.

17:43.361 --> 17:46.301
You know who there's less of?
Statuesque blondes.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.501
You don't read about statuesque blondes
in the newspapers anymore.

17:49.857 --> 17:52.703
Buxom ones, neither.
They're like a lost race.

17:54.049 --> 17:55.632
What do you got next?

17:56.238 --> 17:57.907
School project meeting.

17:59.489 --> 18:01.503
Mr. Whiting builds his Pulitzer.

18:14.228 --> 18:15.940
Now I've seen everything.

18:30.949 --> 18:32.945
Why not call a cab at least?

18:33.104 --> 18:35.638
If I thought these motherfuckers
would reimburse me, I would have.

18:35.772 --> 18:37.896
So homicide can't
shop cars neither.

18:38.056 --> 18:39.805
We're down to two working units.

18:39.965 --> 18:43.346
One was at the morgue with Fahlteich,
the other was on fresh call.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.598
Jesus.
What a joke.

18:48.132 --> 18:52.318
67-year-old female, mother of 4,
grandmother to many,

18:52.831 --> 18:54.045
lived alone.

18:54.786 --> 18:56.943
Not seen in two days,
so the neighbor called.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.382
No forced entry.

18:58.868 --> 19:01.584
- You the first officer?
- Had to kick in the back door.

19:02.030 --> 19:04.384
- You call for crime lab?
- We're on the list.

19:04.993 --> 19:06.205
Today's list?

19:06.364 --> 19:07.845
Fucking crime  lab, too, huh?

19:08.005 --> 19:09.797
They've cut
everything to the bone.

19:13.322 --> 19:15.964
Been here maybe
a couple of days.

19:18.431 --> 19:20.188
If it was warmer, she'd have bloated.

19:20.603 --> 19:22.466
Yeah, it's probably natural.

19:23.211 --> 19:24.525
I just didn't like the way

19:24.685 --> 19:27.224
she  looked laying there
with the pillow and all.

19:27.826 --> 19:29.625
I bet she died in her sleep.

19:30.441 --> 19:32.757
You ever wake up
with a pillow over your face?

19:33.180 --> 19:36.360
There's mornings with a hangover
I hold the pillow over my face

19:36.520 --> 19:38.584
just to keep the light out
and the pain down.

19:38.743 --> 19:42.254
Me, I just throw up once or twice
and go to work.

19:43.648 --> 19:45.253
Western district way.

20:13.492 --> 20:16.440
The word I'm thinking
about is "dickensian."

20:17.640 --> 20:21.049
We want to depict the
dickensian lives of city children

20:21.501 --> 20:25.693
and then show clearly and concisely
where the school system has failed them.

20:25.854 --> 20:29.002
Not to defend the school system, but
a lot of things have failed those kids.

20:29.178 --> 20:31.397
They're marginalized
long before they walk into class.

20:31.557 --> 20:33.371
You wanna look
at who these kids really are,

20:33.531 --> 20:35.737
you gotta look at parenting,
or lack of it, in the city.

20:35.897 --> 20:38.446
The drug culture,
the economics of these neighborhoods.

20:38.606 --> 20:40.666
Yet the schools are
something that we can address.

20:40.825 --> 20:42.738
Sure, we can beat up
on city schools.

20:42.898 --> 20:45.240
Lord knows they deserve to be
beat on every once in a while,

20:45.399 --> 20:47.999
but then we're just as irrelevant
to these kids as the schools are.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.455
It's like you're up
on a corner of a roof

20:50.615 --> 20:53.716
you're showing some people
how a couple of shingles came loose,

20:53.875 --> 20:56.398
and meanwhile, a hurricane wrecked
the rest of the damn house.

20:56.558 --> 20:59.670
you don't need a lot of context to
examine what goes on in one classroom.

20:59.831 --> 21:01.803
- Really?
- I think you need a lot of context

21:01.969 --> 21:03.886
- to seriously examine anything.
- No.

21:04.991 --> 21:07.237
I think Scott is on the right track.

21:07.664 --> 21:10.486
We need to limit the scope,
not get bogged down in details.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.258
To do what? To dress the problem

21:12.418 --> 21:14.630
or to win a prize?
I mean, what are we doing here?

21:14.789 --> 21:16.774
Look, Gus,
I know the problems.

21:17.448 --> 21:19.705
My wife volunteers at a city school,

21:20.024 --> 21:22.403
but what I want to look at
is the tangible,

21:22.830 --> 21:25.545
where the problem and solution
can be measured clearly.

21:25.798 --> 21:28.183
There's more impediments to learning
than a lack of materials

21:28.342 --> 21:29.966
or a dysfunctional bureaucracy.

21:30.249 --> 21:32.024
But who's goingto read that?

21:32.955 --> 21:34.765
What is this series about in a sentence?

21:34.925 --> 21:36.308
What's the budget line?

21:37.870 --> 21:40.285
Johnny can't write 'cause
Johnny have never a fucking pencil.

21:40.601 --> 21:43.941
Augustus, I'm not as simple-minded
as you might think.

21:44.353 --> 21:46.320
Now what do you want,
an educational project

21:46.481 --> 21:48.085
or a litany of excuses?

21:48.279 --> 21:53.046
I don't want some amorphous series
detailing society's ills.

21:53.488 --> 21:55.790
If you leave everything in,
soon you've got nothin

21:57.863 --> 21:59.820
I think the schools
are ripe for exploration,

21:59.980 --> 22:03.340
and I think Scott might be the man
to lead the charge.

22:18.419 --> 22:20.867
You ain't doin' nothin'
but aggravatin' me now.

22:21.027 --> 22:25.021
Get up in this house before
I beat the black off your ass.

22:25.632 --> 22:27.560
Get up in here, fool. Come on.

22:28.716 --> 22:29.682
Treena.

22:30.074 --> 22:32.681
Treena. Wait for me.
I'm gonna come back out.

22:32.842 --> 22:35.390
- Stay right here. Don't move.
- Girl.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.390
Wooton, you dump in the numbers
from the port story yet?

22:56.550 --> 22:59.252
- Oh, shit. I forgot. You want--
- Give them to me. I'll put them in.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.640
Overall, cargo is down by 12 points,

23:01.793 --> 23:04.768
but roll-on, rll-off gained
6.4% last year.

23:04.928 --> 23:07.652
A-ight. Drop 12, ro-ro's up 6.4.

23:07.812 --> 23:09.516
- Thanks, got it.
- Boss man on your 6.

23:09.711 --> 23:11.659
- Whiting?
- Worse. Klebanow.

23:12.569 --> 23:13.598
Augustus.

23:14.064 --> 23:17.716
Who's the lead for opening day tomorrow?
Not the game story but the color piece.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.893
Luxenberg wanted to go with Mcguire.

23:20.354 --> 23:22.771
I think Scott would do an excellent job
with the color piece.

23:23.340 --> 23:25.934
You know, I'd really like
to find some chaw-chewing old-timer

23:26.094 --> 23:27.932
who'd die rather than
miss the o's opener,

23:28.092 --> 23:30.154
someone who says, "baseball," you know?

23:30.774 --> 23:31.739
You're the boss.

23:32.569 --> 23:34.243
Scott, put your special touch on it

23:34.403 --> 23:36.970
like you did
with your preakness piece last year.

23:37.739 --> 23:39.276
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

24:24.596 --> 24:25.462
Fuck.

24:27.948 --> 24:29.071
What's wrong?

24:29.418 --> 24:31.346
Sorry.
Go back to sleep, baby.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.694
<i>- Metro desk.
- Hey, Spry, it's me.</i>

24:37.257 --> 24:39.001
Is the night man
still on the copy desk?

24:39.161 --> 24:40.720
<i>Sure is.
You need to make a change?</i>

24:40.881 --> 24:43.914
Yeah, I think I just want
to check on the port story.

24:44.393 --> 24:46.235
I think I might have
transposed some numbers.

24:46.690 --> 24:48.303
Andy, can I get port back?

24:48.709 --> 24:49.685
Yeah, sure.

24:50.183 --> 24:52.111
We got time on the final.
Go ahead.

24:52.271 --> 24:54.384
Yeah. Somewhere down
in the a-matter,

24:54.787 --> 24:56.908
a graph about the cargo trends
with percentages.

24:57.068 --> 24:58.526
<i>Ro-ro, cargo.</i>

24:58.685 --> 25:00.908
<i>- Read that back to me.
- Cargo down 12%,</i>

25:01.068 --> 25:02.500
<i>ro-ro up 6.4.</i>

25:02.661 --> 25:05.944
12-point decrease
and a 6.4 bump on the ro-ro?

25:06.378 --> 25:07.582
<i>Yep, that's it.</i>

25:07.947 --> 25:08.857
Shit.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.057
I woke up in a sweat 'cause I thought I
fucked that up. You sure?

25:12.217 --> 25:16.718
Tonight, you had the usual deadline
nightmare to no actual purpose.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.960
I guess you're better at
this than you thought.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.311
Yeah, I guess.

25:22.866 --> 25:24.075
Thanks, Jay.

25:24.236 --> 25:25.806
<i>Anytime. Good night.</i>

25:25.965 --> 25:29.453
<i>The husband's thinking, "gosh." I mean,
the police show up at his door and say,</i>

25:29.613 --> 25:31.551
"the lady you married from the Uraine,

25:31.781 --> 25:35.682
<i>"A she's dead;
b, she's got a 2005 gold Mrcedes."</i>

25:47.699 --> 25:49.345
How long 'til my old lady?

25:51.108 --> 25:52.578
It's gonna be a while.

25:52.899 --> 25:55.242
- Got my hands full.
- I'm across the street for breakfast.

25:55.402 --> 25:57.276
At this point,
there's only one way to rule.

25:57.435 --> 26:00.535
Come on. Bullshit.
This is not a murder. He overdosed.

26:00.696 --> 26:02.593
Look, we found his gear
on the bathroom floor,

26:02.753 --> 26:05.719
and his girlfriend, who called 911,
said  the two of them were firing.

26:05.878 --> 26:08.315
I don't have the tox results yet
but even if they find heroin,

26:08.474 --> 26:10.160
right now,
it'd be a secondary cause.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.482
I've got petechials,
bruising around the neck.

26:12.641 --> 26:14.854
My preliminary is homicide
by mechanical asphyxia.

26:14.955 --> 26:17.487
Ok, fine. I'll fucking bring
the paramedic in here,

26:17.587 --> 26:19.415
and he'll fucking explain
it to you himself.

26:19.576 --> 26:21.492
That's right.
I'm going to go back to dundalk,

26:21.652 --> 26:23.601
drag his ass in here
so you can hear it from him

26:23.762 --> 26:25.993
'cause I ain't taking this as a murder.

26:27.733 --> 26:29.098
Hey, Jimmy.

26:29.602 --> 26:30.875
Nancy. How's tricks?

26:31.571 --> 26:33.805
Heard you were working murders again.

26:33.964 --> 26:35.425
How's life in the county?

26:35.702 --> 26:36.799
Worse every year.

26:36.959 --> 26:39.217
You guys can't keep all the
dirt on your side of the line.

26:39.377 --> 26:40.793
What's Kevin so hot about?

26:41.617 --> 26:44.333
New cutter's dug her heels in,
says it's a murder.

26:44.890 --> 26:47.395
It's not, but I can see why
she'd think strangulation.

26:47.646 --> 26:50.658
Guy's got a fractured hyoid,
petechia in both eyes,

26:51.199 --> 26:52.528
but it's a freak thing.

26:52.689 --> 26:55.602
If we weren't there to see it,
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

26:55.913 --> 26:57.437
It's all post-mortem.

26:57.758 --> 26:59.910
He fires up a speedball,
then blacks out,

27:00.230 --> 27:01.889
falls between toilet and bathtub,

27:02.050 --> 27:04.516
manages to get himself
wedged back pretty good.

27:04.675 --> 27:06.450
I couldn't make this shit up.

27:06.611 --> 27:09.192
Medics come, pronounce him
right then and there,

27:09.352 --> 27:12.541
but get this-they can't pry the guy
out without grabbing hold

27:12.701 --> 27:14.056
of his neck for leverage.

27:14.217 --> 27:17.742
We watched them do it.
This dundalk medic and the morgue guy

27:17.903 --> 27:20.024
just grab his neck and start yanking.

27:20.184 --> 27:23.402
Finally they get him out, he comes
down here looking like a strangle job.

27:23.889 --> 27:25.812
They can't tell that it's post-mort?

27:25.972 --> 27:27.484
On a fresh body, no one can.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.912
Grab a guy too hard,
and you can cause petechia,

27:30.073 --> 27:32.865
break a hyoid,
even leave bruising,

27:33.026 --> 27:35.311
- all after death.
- Fuck me.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.182
So Infante's about to lose his mind

27:39.343 --> 27:41.500
if he can't talk this thing
out of becoming a murder.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.969
Either that or
charge the paramedic.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.258
Hey. You goin'
across the street for breakfast?

27:47.418 --> 27:49.916
- Buy me some scrapple, sailor?
- Come on.

27:54.530 --> 27:55.526
Number two.

28:37.986 --> 28:38.984
Surprise.

28:41.999 --> 28:44.993
My man Sergei
thought we should talk first.

28:45.742 --> 28:48.258
- Talk about what?
- That's on you, youngun.

28:48.418 --> 28:50.651
Whatever business
you tryin' to do through the Russians,

28:50.811 --> 28:52.217
you got to go through me first.

28:54.179 --> 28:56.496
'cause up in this bitch here,

28:56.657 --> 29:00.656
I'm what you might consider
an authority figure.

29:01.724 --> 29:04.477
You know everybody got to
get my help or ask my advice,

29:04.637 --> 29:06.146
like, on all kinds of shit.

29:06.803 --> 29:09.813
Sergei step to me the other day
sayin' this nigga Marlo,

29:10.284 --> 29:11.867
who he don't even know,

29:12.386 --> 29:15.554
just be sending him cash money
to get on his visiting list.

29:16.008 --> 29:17.820
So then he ask me if  I knew Marlo.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.427
I tell him,
"hell, yeah, I know Marlo real well."

29:21.256 --> 29:22.058
You know?

29:22.232 --> 29:24.505
Over westside,
everybody know everybody, right?

29:27.038 --> 29:28.733
Let me help you find your tongue.

29:28.893 --> 29:32.085
You tryin' to get to the Russian
so you can get a line to his people.

29:32.245 --> 29:34.597
You tryin' to get
to the Greek motherfuckers

29:34.697 --> 29:36.218
because if you can

29:36.708 --> 29:40.140
you want to cut Proposition Joe
and all them other east side bitches

29:40.762 --> 29:41.793
out the connect.

29:41.953 --> 29:44.673
I mean, you a natural
businessman, right?

29:45.299 --> 29:47.113
But this is the thing, though,
and I mean,

29:47.272 --> 29:49.734
I'm with you on all that
as far as it goes, you know?

29:50.004 --> 29:52.521
Westside definitely need
to stick together, you know what I mean?

29:52.681 --> 29:55.519
And all the fuss about you
comin' at me--

29:55.934 --> 30:00.670
I say let bygones be bygones,
but fuck all them eastside bitches.

30:01.569 --> 30:03.810
That's just the way
I feel about it.

30:04.063 --> 30:08.179
I got nothin' but love in my heart
for westside niggas, nothin' but love.

30:08.538 --> 30:11.028
'course, I mean, you know,

30:11.972 --> 30:13.756
I got to have my taste, too.

30:14.772 --> 30:15.771
Figured that.

30:16.139 --> 30:18.579
So send my sister a hundred large,

30:19.690 --> 30:21.849
and the next time
you come down to Jessup,

30:22.009 --> 30:25.117
it won't be my grill talkin' at you.
My word on that.

30:26.535 --> 30:27.746
A hundred large, huh?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.472
So what's up, man, what's up
with you otherwise, you know?

30:32.632 --> 30:34.402
Ah, the game is the game.

30:36.472 --> 30:37.425
Always.

30:39.186 --> 30:40.480
They do not.

30:42.624 --> 30:45.364
- I'm looking for you, Jimmy.
- Hey, what's up?

30:45.525 --> 30:47.387
You know Nancy Porter
from the county?

30:47.760 --> 30:49.761
- Lester Freamon.
- Good to meet you.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.313
Well, thanks for breakfast.

30:52.748 --> 30:54.373
I'll see you downstairs.

30:55.874 --> 30:58.689
I spent last night sitting
on that same Mcculloh street lot.

30:59.009 --> 31:00.830
- They went back there?
- Twice.

31:01.289 --> 31:04.373
Once in the early evening
and once again after three.

31:05.185 --> 31:06.380
They're getting sloppy,

31:06.569 --> 31:08.806
especially now they think
we've backed away.

31:12.492 --> 31:15.515
You know, a few good bugs,
a couple of small surveillance cameras,

31:15.676 --> 31:17.567
some man hours, 2 weeks,

31:18.059 --> 31:19.112
3 the most.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.645
That's all this
fucking case needs.

31:21.978 --> 31:25.276
Daniels can't give us that.
He made that pretty fucking clear.

31:27.196 --> 31:28.669
Then we go elsewhere.

31:30.311 --> 31:33.697
<i>In right field,
number 21, Nick Markakis.</i>

31:34.421 --> 31:37.409
Going to the game?
Long-time O's fan?

31:37.569 --> 31:39.726
I could care less about
opening day at this point.

31:39.886 --> 31:42.998
Between Bud Selig and Barry Bonds,
they've ruined baseball for me.

31:43.158 --> 31:45.229
- You have a minute to talk?
- Late to meet somebody.

31:45.426 --> 31:47.506
How can you commit to a sport
where the commissioner

31:47.667 --> 31:50.226
justifies a labor lockout
and cancels the world series?

31:50.658 --> 31:52.033
Ho you  been an O's fan?

31:52.423 --> 31:56.860
Actually, I grew up with the cubs,
but my son, he kind of likes them so...

31:57.260 --> 31:58.581
And then on steroids,

31:58.740 --> 32:01.149
which has destroyed
what's left of baseball's credibility,

32:01.309 --> 32:02.623
he's nowhere to be found.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.462
So, you an Orioles fan?

32:05.429 --> 32:08.665
Are you excited at least
that it's opening day, that's kind of...

32:09.443 --> 32:10.699
Fuck, baseball!

32:12.719 --> 32:14.791
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!

32:24.167 --> 32:26.040
51, 52,

32:26.452 --> 32:27.394
53.

32:32.620 --> 32:35.736
Hey, Bubs, how you doin'? Have a seat
all the way around the other side.

32:35.869 --> 32:36.859
Obliged.

32:57.715 --> 33:00.007
Stop crying.
Don't grab stuff off my plate.

33:00.306 --> 33:01.855
Mommy's going to whip you.

33:03.173 --> 33:04.624
Do you need some help here?

33:05.349 --> 33:06.844
Because we don't do that here.

33:07.495 --> 33:10.317
In our house, there's no hitting anyone,
especially children.

33:11.441 --> 33:12.915
Do you understand me?

33:29.839 --> 33:31.980
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic's a nitmare.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.842
Think you're funny, huh?
Think I still don't have--

33:57.953 --> 34:00.072
All right,
I get the point, fuck holes.

34:09.773 --> 34:10.989
Fuck you both, already.

34:11.123 --> 34:13.730
A couple more years of this,
you'll be ready for a radio car.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.224
Why can't you come out
to my office and do this like grownups?

34:16.384 --> 34:19.279
They still make you sign in
at the front desk out Woodlawn?

34:20.085 --> 34:21.824
Who'd you knuckleheads
piss on this time?

34:21.984 --> 34:25.199
We're still working the edges
of something the bosses shut down.

34:25.722 --> 34:28.038
- What are we talking about?
- The bodies in the vacants.

34:28.739 --> 34:31.500
They shut that down?
Jesus Christ.

34:31.905 --> 34:34.824
- What, 22 murders doesn't rate?
- Not anymore.

34:35.647 --> 34:37.835
You were on it more than a year?
Where were you?

34:38.174 --> 34:39.625
Too close to quit.

34:40.969 --> 34:42.319
You know Marlo Stanfield,

34:42.960 --> 34:45.639
Chris Partlow, Snoop Pearson?

34:46.268 --> 34:47.530
Those names ring out.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.484
We got nothing back from any lab work,

34:50.873 --> 34:55.056
there's no witnesses, nothing to make
a murder prosecution, so we settled in,

34:55.431 --> 34:56.841
sat on them for about a year.

34:57.076 --> 34:58.773
- You got a pattern?
- A good one.

34:59.343 --> 35:02.064
2 or 3 weeks with some good
F.B.I. cameras and wires,

35:02.223 --> 35:03.636
maybe a half-dozen agents--

35:03.797 --> 35:06.034
Like we told you boys
when the case broke,

35:06.101 --> 35:08.275
we aren't much
into ghetto drug shit anymore.

35:08.436 --> 35:10.541
Most of our guys are counterterror
and political stuff.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.387
We already did all the long legwork.

35:12.548 --> 35:14.918
2 or 3 weeks, and you guys come
out of this with a big headline.

35:15.079 --> 35:16.739
You federal fucks like headlines.

35:18.505 --> 35:20.176
l'll run it up the flagpole.

35:21.254 --> 35:22.938
- I'm gonna drive away now.
- All right.

35:23.099 --> 35:25.254
If it's ok with
you suckholes.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.645
I got good stuff.

35:35.805 --> 35:38.782
Hang on. Come here.
Tell me so I can put it on the budget.

35:39.197 --> 35:42.317
I got a kid in a wheelchair outside
the stadium, wanting to go to the game

35:42.476 --> 35:44.944
but unable because he didn't have
the money for a scalped ticket.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.761
- Sounds pretty good.
- You got art?

35:46.921 --> 35:49.256
I tried, but photo said
they were too booked with the game.

35:49.417 --> 35:50.853
This is your main color piece.

35:51.134 --> 35:53.319
You got to have a picture of the kid
if he's your lede.

35:53.479 --> 35:55.199
- Can we send them out now?
- I guess.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.079
He probably rolled out,
but you can try.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.165
Shit.

35:58.645 --> 36:00.054
- How old is this fella?
- 13.

36:00.213 --> 36:02.156
What's with his parents?
Why wasn't he in school?

36:02.315 --> 36:03.680
In this city?
He just cut.

36:03.810 --> 36:05.809
- What about his parents?
- Both dead. No shit.

36:05.970 --> 36:07.698
He lives with his aunt
in west Baltimore.

36:07.859 --> 36:09.302
How' he get in the wheelchair?

36:09.461 --> 36:11.856
Something about a stray gunshot.
It was all pretty vague.

36:12.016 --> 36:13.442
You got a date when it happened?

36:13.601 --> 36:15.395
He was a little hinky
with telling me much.

36:15.555 --> 36:17.584
Fact is, he would only
let me go with his nickname.

36:17.684 --> 36:20.158
Look. I got to start writing
if you want it for the e-dot.

36:21.355 --> 36:23.892
Why don't you work in metro write
so I can read over your shoulder.

36:25.220 --> 36:26.702
What he go by, the nickname?

36:26.862 --> 36:27.852
E.J.

36:28.012 --> 36:28.953
E.J.

36:30.983 --> 36:32.910
Hey, jane, come here a minute.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.522
Check clips for the last 3 years.

36:36.681 --> 36:39.829
See if we got anything on a kid
in the city wounded by a stray bullet.

36:40.151 --> 36:41.295
He'd be 13 now.

36:41.456 --> 36:43.493
Nickname of E.J.
Could be his initials.

36:43.826 --> 36:46.127
- Who is he to us?
- The lede of our opening day piece.

36:46.288 --> 36:48.178
If we find him,
I'd love to get art on the kid.

36:48.338 --> 36:49.897
Don't hold your breath.

36:56.943 --> 36:58.755
It's a hell of
a case, really.

36:58.914 --> 37:01.132
And God knows
they can use the help.

37:19.991 --> 37:21.709
- Sorry I'm late.
- Anything up?

37:22.366 --> 37:23.886
- Just the usual.
- You all right?

37:25.911 --> 37:27.990
We do this right,
it is like a spiral.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.807
We start on the outside of the circle,
and we work our way around the edges,

37:31.967 --> 37:33.373
pick up everything we can

37:33.533 --> 37:35.671
before we get to Clay
and the people he keeps close.

37:35.831 --> 37:37.668
You think Clay knows
the indictment's coming?

37:37.829 --> 37:41.335
Clay Davis has been waiting for
the other shoe to drop his whole life.

37:44.026 --> 37:45.142
He knows.

37:45.869 --> 37:47.509
And it's your people up in my shit.

37:47.669 --> 37:50.607
Not no feds, not no state
people from Annapolis.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.597
It's motherfuckers
from my own city.

37:52.756 --> 37:54.245
My hands are tied here, Clayton.

37:54.653 --> 37:56.539
It's a new Mayor,
a new state's attorney.

37:56.962 --> 37:59.912
I'm out there doing the Lord's work
for you, Erv. You know it.

38:00.185 --> 38:02.446
Who got that pay raise
through the council--

38:02.606 --> 38:04.840
just enough for you
to get that new patio

38:05.000 --> 38:07.428
but not enough for that guy
from Pittsburgh to take your place?

38:07.792 --> 38:09.057
I wish I could.

38:09.218 --> 38:10.705
You know I wish I could,

38:11.045 --> 38:13.145
but with Carcetti in,
people are watching.

38:13.305 --> 38:14.542
I got eyes on me now.

38:14.702 --> 38:16.216
You the commissioner still, right?

38:16.572 --> 38:18.210
Yeah,
but it ain't like it was.

38:18.369 --> 38:19.943
If you don't control it, who does?

38:20.121 --> 38:22.237
On this, I got to reach around Daniels,

38:22.510 --> 38:24.251
and he's Carcetti's boy.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.172
This is a grand jury
instigation for God's sake.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.959
We could both be charged
with obstruction of justice.

38:33.118 --> 38:36.189
Goddamn it, Erv. I been there for you,
carried water for you,

38:36.348 --> 38:37.548
and you do me like this?

38:37.708 --> 38:39.121
Clay, I can't.

38:39.596 --> 38:40.676
Nobody could.

38:42.356 --> 38:44.122
You think I'm goin' down, don't you?

38:45.648 --> 38:47.449
You think I'm done.

38:47.860 --> 38:51.056
All y'all ungrateful bitches
thinkin' you can throw me out the boat.

38:51.216 --> 38:52.583
- Clay.
- A-ight!

38:53.558 --> 38:55.317
I'm gonna remember this moment, Erv.

38:55.739 --> 38:57.756
I'm gonna hold onto this moment.

39:09.618 --> 39:10.884
Clay crying to you?

39:11.044 --> 39:13.334
Like I can put
brakes on this mess.

39:13.746 --> 39:14.688
Is that--

39:14.848 --> 39:16.769
Yeah. Straight from p-and-r.

39:18.162 --> 39:20.350
And that's with the numbers
bent as far as we dare.

39:20.790 --> 39:23.096
With city hall asking for clean stats,

39:23.257 --> 39:26.650
- there's only so much we can do.
- The hell are we gonna tell the Mayor?

39:31.521 --> 39:34.080
I sat there for half an hour
with him and his deputy.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.727
He knows what he's saying no to.

39:35.887 --> 39:38.288
- Well, then how the fuck--
- It's personal, Jimmy.

39:38.449 --> 39:40.742
Somebody at City Hall
really pissed off the U.S. Attorney.

39:40.902 --> 39:43.127
- You're kidding me.
- No, and I got an earful.

39:43.728 --> 39:46.667
You tell Lester that I'm still trying
to figure out what the problem is,

39:46.827 --> 39:50.178
but for right now, you forget
about shopping this case anywhere.

39:50.666 --> 39:54.808
D.E.A., A.T.F., customs--
you guys are shut out across the bord.

39:55.897 --> 39:58.086
Fish and fucking wildlife
couldn't help you.

39:58.245 --> 39:59.558
Sorry, brother.

40:02.876 --> 40:04.794
The kid is
nowhere to be found.

40:04.954 --> 40:07.740
I sent photo down there
to try and dig him up. Nothing.

40:08.083 --> 40:09.133
Probably left.

40:09.293 --> 40:10.918
So we got a poor black kid

40:11.200 --> 40:12.608
in a wheelchair with no ticket.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.207
He rolls himself from
somewhere in west Baltimore to--

40:15.615 --> 40:19.046
To "the shadow of the mighty brick-faced
coliseum known as oriole park,"

40:19.414 --> 40:22.877
listening to "the cheers from the crowd,
which told the whole tale."

40:23.645 --> 40:27.007
We're gonna give good play
to a 13-year-old known only as E.J.,

40:27.167 --> 40:29.378
who declines to give his name
because he skipped school,

40:29.538 --> 40:31.400
he's got no parents,
he lives with his aunt.

40:31.560 --> 40:35.065
I'm not saying that this kid isn't
everything you say he is, but damn,

40:35.347 --> 40:38.247
as an editor, I need a little more
to go on if I'm gonna fly this thing.

40:38.682 --> 40:39.976
I resent the implication.

40:40.198 --> 40:42.597
I'm not implying anything.
I'm on your side.

40:42.865 --> 40:44.894
But the standard for
us has to be--

40:45.956 --> 40:48.579
Just finished your story.
Good read.

40:49.108 --> 40:50.398
I'm putting it out front.

40:50.558 --> 40:52.941
I think you've really captured
the disparity

40:53.114 --> 40:55.459
of the two worlds in this city
in a highly readable narrative.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.866
I wouldn't change a word.

40:57.061 --> 40:59.887
Thanks, but I'm not sure
everyone shares your enthusiasm.

41:00.046 --> 41:01.694
Aren't you just a little bit concerned

41:01.854 --> 41:03.840
that we don't even
have a last name for this kid?

41:04.122 --> 41:05.763
I thought we held ourselves up to a--

41:05.922 --> 41:08.071
It's not an ideal situation, no,

41:08.402 --> 41:10.566
but the boy's reluctance
to give his last name

41:10.727 --> 41:13.780
clearly stems from his fear
of being  discovered as a truant.

41:14.750 --> 41:17.704
- You have a problem with it?
- A little bit, kind of, yeah.

41:18.095 --> 41:21.346
- I'm just saying that--
- I think we're on terra firma here.

41:25.112 --> 41:26.130
Gotcha.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.708
The man made the call.
You're good to go.

41:29.102 --> 41:30.293
Thanks, Scott.

41:35.686 --> 41:37.651
The nigga Webster's shop right there.

41:37.811 --> 41:41.878
So look, I'm gonna roll up,
and y'all gonna pop out and pop off.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.701
Drop who you can.

41:45.284 --> 41:47.444
Let's go all west coast with this.

41:50.584 --> 41:51.578
Say what?

41:51.738 --> 41:52.839
Drive-by.

41:53.173 --> 41:54.617
That's how they do.

41:54.778 --> 41:56.843
Drop a motherfucker
and not slow down.

41:57.004 --> 41:58.562
<i>Like Boys 'n' the Hood.</i>

41:59.325 --> 42:00.857
Shit was tight, remember?

42:17.623 --> 42:19.908
Man, I ain't even hit
near one of them.

42:20.068 --> 42:21.498
This nigga's wound.

42:28.678 --> 42:30.130
Fuck them west coast niggas

42:30.607 --> 42:33.442
'cause in B-more,
we aim to hit a nigga, you heard.

42:40.162 --> 42:42.671
Guy leaves two dozen bodies
scattered all over the city,

42:42.831 --> 42:44.282
no one gives a fuck.

42:45.273 --> 42:47.190
It's because who he dropped.

42:47.350 --> 42:48.311
True that.

42:48.780 --> 42:51.926
You can go a long way in this country
killing black folk.

42:52.658 --> 42:54.126
Young males especially.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.403
Misdemeanor homicides.

42:56.829 --> 42:59.291
- If Marlo was killing white women.
- White children.

42:59.908 --> 43:00.796
Tourists.

43:03.323 --> 43:06.708
One white ex-cheerleader
tourist missing in Aruba.

43:07.162 --> 43:09.963
Trouble is,
this ain't Aruba, bitch.

43:11.453 --> 43:15.341
You think that if 300 white people
were killed in this city every year,

43:15.501 --> 43:18.330
they wouldn't send the 82nd airborne?

43:19.102 --> 43:20.391
Negro, please.

43:20.552 --> 43:22.903
There's got to be someway
to make them turn on the faucet.

43:23.063 --> 43:25.326
Come on, Jimmy.
You're the smartest boy in the room.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.860
You come up with something
in this broke-ass city.

43:39.298 --> 43:41.400
Isn't he married or some shit now?

43:47.808 --> 43:49.927
Did you edit this opening day piece?

43:51.588 --> 43:53.916
Whiting himself blessed it as written

43:54.241 --> 43:56.139
before I could take a meat ax to it.

43:56.299 --> 43:58.671
Did it bother you that we don't have
the boy's full name?

43:59.125 --> 44:00.912
Yes, Rebecca, it did.

44:03.235 --> 44:04.728
Don't give me that "huh."

44:04.887 --> 44:06.664
Whiting wasn't buying
any problem I had.

44:06.901 --> 44:08.352
No art of the kid?

44:11.436 --> 44:12.415
None.

44:19.340 --> 44:20.838
How long we been here?

44:23.485 --> 44:24.761
More than a hour.

44:25.072 --> 44:26.970
Why you think
we sitting here?

44:28.508 --> 44:30.307
See who home and who not,

44:31.953 --> 44:33.210
who on the block,

44:33.881 --> 44:36.233
- police and whatnot.
- That's right.

44:37.274 --> 44:40.154
You don't ever want to be
the last man to a party. You feel me?

44:42.424 --> 44:45.218
That's why I show up to a job
an hour before.

44:45.790 --> 44:46.938
Sometimes two.

44:49.096 --> 44:52.170
I don't want nobody settin' up on me
while I'm settin' up on them.

44:53.409 --> 44:55.134
'Cause there ain't no good thing

44:55.293 --> 44:58.051
about motherfuckin' surprises
in this line of work.

45:00.196 --> 45:02.220
Why we doin' June Bug anyway?

45:02.849 --> 45:05.047
Heard he called
Marlo a dicksuck.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.010
Talkin' shit like that.

45:08.223 --> 45:10.651
You heard.
You ain't sure?

45:11.170 --> 45:12.751
People say he said it.

45:13.821 --> 45:16.490
Don't matter if he said it or not.
People think he said it.

45:17.654 --> 45:19.035
Can't let that shit go.

45:19.376 --> 45:20.351
Why not?

45:21.831 --> 45:24.430
I mean,
Marlo ain't suck no dick, right?

45:26.801 --> 45:29.637
So if Marlo knows he ain't suck dick,

45:30.184 --> 45:32.355
then what the fuck he care
what June Bug say?

45:32.515 --> 45:34.139
What anybody say?

45:36.040 --> 45:38.220
Why this boy got to get dead,
just for talking shit?

45:38.381 --> 45:40.978
'cause he got a big
motherfuckin' mouth, that's why,

45:41.139 --> 45:44.063
and you need to stop runnin'
your own mouth, young 'un.

45:48.726 --> 45:49.917
There it is.

45:51.158 --> 45:52.764
And all the muscle he got.

45:53.326 --> 45:54.364
See it?

45:55.096 --> 45:56.053
You ready?

45:57.575 --> 45:59.149
Now you handle that thing.

45:59.573 --> 46:00.808
You give me a sign,

46:00.968 --> 46:03.279
meet me out front.
Michael, you go 'round the alley.

46:03.439 --> 46:06.299
Body come bustin' out the back,
you drop that shit.

46:39.462 --> 46:40.958
Oh, shitfuck.

46:42.238 --> 46:44.142
Bunk's usually the one throwing up.

46:45.038 --> 46:46.289
You took aspirin?

46:46.961 --> 46:47.741
6.

46:49.518 --> 46:50.910
How was that brunette?

46:51.971 --> 46:55.198
Must have been a decent ride
'cause he never went home.

46:56.754 --> 46:58.790
Same shirt as yesterday, Jimmy.

47:03.438 --> 47:04.911
You catchin' hell from Beadie?

47:06.668 --> 47:07.541
No.

47:08.246 --> 47:10.022
- Just asking.
- Gentlemen.

47:10.951 --> 47:12.667
D.O.A. Central and Baltimore.

47:13.273 --> 47:14.817
I took a call two days ago.

47:15.507 --> 47:17.930
The old lady? That wasn't a call.
That came back natural.

47:18.623 --> 47:20.447
Look. I'm hungover, Jay.

47:24.278 --> 47:25.997
Both of you. You're up.

47:49.723 --> 47:52.215
Mommy. Mommy!

48:20.923 --> 48:22.199
'Sup, Boris?

48:23.564 --> 48:24.583
You know who I am?

48:25.037 --> 48:28.307
I'm that rich uncle been putting
all that money in your canteen account.

48:32.385 --> 48:35.677
In my country, I was
in jail 4 years.

48:37.346 --> 48:40.821
In my country,
this is not prison.

48:42.758 --> 48:44.104
This is nothing.

48:45.811 --> 48:47.198
I don't need money.

48:48.194 --> 48:50.219
I don't need fucking canteen.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.126
I don't need you.

48:59.033 --> 49:01.089
- Gangbanger.
- A-ight. I feel that.

49:01.761 --> 49:04.307
I feel that, but Avon over there,

49:05.498 --> 49:08.522
he thinks you might be able
to help get a message to the Greeks,

49:09.168 --> 49:10.250
to Vondas.

49:16.693 --> 49:19.159
I mean, seeing as
you don't need my money,

49:21.499 --> 49:23.441
Vondas might be happy to have it.

49:26.453 --> 49:28.467
If he don't want see me, he won't,

49:30.027 --> 49:31.240
but if he do,

49:32.467 --> 49:34.095
it's you that made it happen.

50:04.601 --> 50:06.302
Sonny Mays is running late.

50:06.908 --> 50:08.685
Can you fill in as speaker?

50:10.275 --> 50:12.053
It's time to share, Bubs.

50:13.088 --> 50:15.545
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm not feeling so great today.

50:15.705 --> 50:18.154
Look, as your sponsor,
I'm telling you,

50:18.957 --> 50:20.775
you got to step up for something.

50:21.087 --> 50:22.256
I don't care what.

50:22.575 --> 50:24.459
I don't care
if it's in these rooms or not,

50:25.004 --> 50:27.456
but there ain't no laying
in the cut on this shit.

50:27.616 --> 50:29.287
You got to step up somewhere.

50:42.881 --> 50:44.564
Detective, can I get a word?

50:44.910 --> 50:46.899
Anything?
Anything on the suspects?

50:48.502 --> 50:50.213
Maybe on your way out then.

50:58.333 --> 50:59.754
Backdoor was open.

51:00.426 --> 51:02.898
Can't tell if he ran through
and out the rear.

51:04.193 --> 51:06.742
They. Unless the shooter
put a bullet in her head

51:06.902 --> 51:08.617
for good measure
after the shotgun.

51:08.778 --> 51:11.099
Also, two of our street
cameras were disabled.

51:11.259 --> 51:12.906
- Wires ripped.
- Fuck.

51:13.066 --> 51:14.499
That's a whole lot of thinking

51:14.659 --> 51:17.470
for any motherfucker
to do something like this.

51:30.730 --> 51:31.979
How the fuck?

51:35.792 --> 51:36.723
How?

51:37.779 --> 51:39.706
He must have been
in that closet the whole time.

51:40.026 --> 51:41.140
no one heard shit.

51:41.544 --> 51:43.254
Call D.S.S.
Now.

51:44.801 --> 51:45.972
Any media out back?

51:47.085 --> 51:48.633
Bring a cage car around.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.653
Hey.
How you doing?

52:09.640 --> 52:11.779
look, I don't know
what I can do to help.

52:11.939 --> 52:13.372
I'm just tryin' to find my way.

52:13.825 --> 52:16.381
seein' how crowded it is,
maybe I can help you hand out tickets.

52:17.889 --> 52:20.944
That's fine, Bubs. Really,
but wouldn't you rather serve?

52:22.537 --> 52:23.675
Serve lunch.

52:24.143 --> 52:26.947
- You mean give the food to people?
- Isn't that the best part?

52:27.915 --> 52:30.537
- Nah, I can't. No.
- All right. Come on.

52:32.098 --> 52:34.479
We can always use
an extra set of hands.

52:39.034 --> 52:40.205
He fell out.

52:40.977 --> 52:43.236
Last bottle of smoke
probably did him in.

52:43.396 --> 52:45.561
Another drunk found him,
pulled me off post.

52:45.720 --> 52:47.182
Ten-seven when I arrived.

52:48.259 --> 52:49.659
You call for a crime lab?

52:49.818 --> 52:51.466
The wait's 2 to 3 hours.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.262
Shit gets worse every day.

53:05.635 --> 53:06.566
You ok?

53:09.686 --> 53:11.296
Go get yourself a coffee,

53:11.991 --> 53:14.971
Do your paperwork, get back
on the street. we got it from here.

53:15.131 --> 53:17.088
We're gonna wait on them anyway.

53:17.326 --> 53:18.842
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

53:22.215 --> 53:24.094
Don't let this guy go anywhere.

53:24.527 --> 53:26.368
I forgot
something in the car.

53:27.487 --> 53:29.242
Bring the paper in, will you?

53:30.697 --> 53:32.191
We're gonna be here awhile.

55:02.438 --> 55:03.868
Little early for that, ain't it?

55:12.933 --> 55:14.278
What the fuck you doing?

55:14.438 --> 55:16.117
Just watch the door, Bunk.

55:18.506 --> 55:19.350
Shit.

55:23.839 --> 55:24.986
Come on, Jimmy.

55:25.637 --> 55:26.815
Get a fuckin' grip.

55:44.982 --> 55:46.672
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

56:01.603 --> 56:02.839
Oh, goddamn it.

56:10.123 --> 56:12.962
Oh, Jesus Christ, you sick fuck.

56:24.708 --> 56:26.346
There's a serial killer in Baltimore.

56:28.101 --> 56:29.868
He preys on the weakest among us.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.278
He needs to be caught.

56:36.740 --> 56:37.803
I'm gone.

56:38.797 --> 56:40.553
I don't want a part of this.
