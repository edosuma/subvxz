WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:03.204
Shaun Robert Murphy,

00:04.509 --> 00:07.382
- do you take Lea Abigail Dilallo...

00:08.774 --> 00:10.274
...to be your wife...

00:12.125 --> 00:13.625
...to live together...

00:19.437 --> 00:20.482
Okay.

00:20.656 --> 00:22.223
Shaun?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.897
We got this.

00:29.099 --> 00:29.882
Everyone...

00:30.056 --> 00:31.710
We're prepared.

00:49.902 --> 00:52.601
To keep her
in sickness and health,

00:52.775 --> 00:55.038
- forsaking all others,

00:55.212 --> 00:57.823
- for as long as you both shall live?

01:18.844 --> 01:20.644
We are not having
an outdoor wedding.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.328
Okay.

01:31.944 --> 01:33.119
Hey.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.860
Hi.

01:35.034 --> 01:37.341
- I had a great time last night.
- Me too.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.212
Want to go grab
some breakfast?

01:39.387 --> 01:40.887
I got to get to the hospital.

01:43.042 --> 01:44.043
I'm a surgeon.

01:44.217 --> 01:45.717
Oh.

02:00.364 --> 02:02.105
You look beautiful as always.

02:02.279 --> 02:04.039
One plus of only
having video chats...

02:04.063 --> 02:05.674
No morning breath.

02:05.848 --> 02:08.545
I remember it being
like a summer breeze.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.852
What's on your
agenda for the day?

02:10.026 --> 02:11.680
Ugh, budget hell.

02:11.854 --> 02:13.701
Our department's way in the
red, so I don't see a way to...

02:13.725 --> 02:14.944
Perhaps I should let you go.

02:15.118 --> 02:17.468
No, no. I was, uh...

02:17.642 --> 02:20.297
Hoping for a little
excitement this morning,

02:20.471 --> 02:22.406
- but it looks like you're
out and about, so...

02:22.430 --> 02:23.980
...I can make myself available.

02:24.301 --> 02:25.801
Excellent.

02:28.174 --> 02:30.283
Just give me two minutes
to make this go away, yeah?

02:30.307 --> 02:31.807
Sure.

02:35.007 --> 02:37.053
I can go away,
but not in two minutes.

02:43.407 --> 02:45.844
So, my lawyer
called me last night-

02:46.018 --> 02:48.064
- to tell me I'm no
longer a wanted man,

02:48.238 --> 02:50.788
- which, hopefully,
only applies to law enforcement.

03:05.037 --> 03:07.039
Nice exposure of the right tonsil.

03:07.213 --> 03:08.954
Visibility can be tough with kids.

03:09.128 --> 03:10.782
Someone's in a good mood.

03:10.956 --> 03:12.847
That's your third
compliment this morning.

03:12.871 --> 03:15.265
Mateo flew up from
Guatemala last night.

03:15.439 --> 03:17.876
Oh, she's in a good mood
because she had sex.

03:18.050 --> 03:19.574
Retract the superior pole.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.302
Mateo can come to
the engagement party-

03:23.404 --> 03:24.405
- this Saturdayif he wants.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.710
Also the wedding,

03:25.884 --> 03:27.558
- depending on how
long he is staying.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.279
We don't know when it will be,

03:29.453 --> 03:31.257
- but I do know it
will not be outdoors.

03:31.281 --> 03:32.781
Incise the tonsillar pillar-

03:32.891 --> 03:34.434
- and dissect around the capsule.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.131
Lea is making all
of the arrangements-

03:36.155 --> 03:37.785
- because she wants
it to be perfect,

03:37.809 --> 03:40.725
- but all that matters
to me is marrying Lea,

03:40.899 --> 03:43.299
- and any day that happens
will be a perfect day.

03:43.336 --> 03:45.295
Oh, that's very sweet.

03:45.469 --> 03:47.447
But planning a wedding's
a big undertaking.

03:47.471 --> 03:49.821
Mia got pretty overwhelmed
planning ours.

03:49.995 --> 03:51.997
Better keep checking in.

03:52.171 --> 03:55.131
Oh, there's a firm, irregular mass-

03:55.305 --> 03:57.176
- in this tonsil.

03:57.350 --> 03:58.850
Get that to pathology.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.312
Some, uh,
shortness of breath,

04:02.486 --> 04:04.508
- occasional blurred
vision and headaches,

04:04.532 --> 04:06.432
- and this morning,
my urine was foamy.

04:06.577 --> 04:08.163
How many exam rooms in this clinic?

04:08.187 --> 04:09.972
Three.
Any blood in your urine?

04:10.146 --> 04:11.930
A little.
I love that blouse.

04:12.104 --> 04:13.671
- Chloe?
- Cushnie.

04:15.194 --> 04:16.500
You take 20 milligrams
of Ritalin L.A. a day?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.197
For my ADHD.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.088
Just three?
I hardly had to wait at all.

04:20.112 --> 04:21.853
Blurred vision and headaches-

04:22.027 --> 04:23.289
- can be side effects from Ritalin.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.746
Would you be willing to stop your
medication for a couple of days,

04:25.770 --> 04:27.705
- see if they're causing
any of your symptoms?

04:27.729 --> 04:30.229
I'll refer any complaints
about my behavior to you.

04:30.949 --> 04:33.038
Foamy urine concerns me.

04:33.212 --> 04:34.929
Could be kidney stones,
so we should do a CT...

04:34.953 --> 04:37.203
I see by your ID badges
you're both residents,

04:37.347 --> 04:38.933
- but you seem to
be more in charge.

04:38.957 --> 04:40.907
Is that official,
or are you just bossy?

04:43.266 --> 04:45.355
Tell me if I'm asking
too many questions.

04:45.529 --> 04:47.179
You're asking too many questions.

04:47.226 --> 04:49.876
We're gonna run some labs
and do a CT of your kidneys.

04:53.145 --> 04:55.123
Are you overwhelmed
planning the wedding?

04:55.147 --> 04:57.430
Because Park and Lim thought
you might be overwhelmed.

04:57.454 --> 04:59.021
Nope, not at all.

04:59.195 --> 05:00.065
I've got it.
It's gonna be great.

05:00.239 --> 05:01.589
Oh, great.

05:01.763 --> 05:03.263
That's why they're divorced.

05:03.416 --> 05:05.506
I'm also great,
because my tonsillectomy-

05:05.680 --> 05:08.136
- may have found something
worse than an infection,

05:08.160 --> 05:10.617
- which may be interesting...
Or may still be very boring.

05:10.641 --> 05:12.489
I won't know for sure
until the path results...

05:12.513 --> 05:15.013
Maybe let me know once
it's definitely interesting?

05:25.917 --> 05:27.615
This is a very small office.

05:31.183 --> 05:33.055
Actually, it feels a lot larger-

05:33.229 --> 05:34.578
- when I'm the only one in it.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.102
- Who are you?
- I'm Salen.

05:37.276 --> 05:39.428
Are you really the
president of the hospital?

05:39.452 --> 05:41.402
Uh, it says so on
the sign on your door.

05:41.454 --> 05:43.631
Pretty small office
for such a big title.

05:43.805 --> 05:45.633
Nicole?

05:45.807 --> 05:47.393
You used to be a neurosurgeon,
but now you...

05:47.417 --> 05:49.332
- Actually, I still am.
- You do both.

05:49.506 --> 05:51.029
But do you identify more-

05:51.203 --> 05:52.803
- as a "doctor" or an executive?

05:52.944 --> 05:55.120
Actually, I identify
more as someone-

05:55.294 --> 05:57.664
- who wants to get back
to work as soon as possible.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.298
Nicole!

05:59.472 --> 06:01.407
Salen... I'm sorry,
Dr. Glassman. I'm so sorry.

06:01.431 --> 06:03.031
We'll be out of here right away.

06:03.085 --> 06:05.130
Ms. Morrison,
you can't just wander off.

06:05.304 --> 06:06.828
It's time for your CT scan.

06:07.002 --> 06:09.395
Oh. Fantastic.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.754
Ms. Morrison,
please try to hold still.

06:19.928 --> 06:21.928
You're the one who
wanted me off my meds.

06:24.019 --> 06:25.673
Renal pelvis looks clean.

06:25.847 --> 06:28.110
You sound disappointed.

06:28.284 --> 06:29.372
Morgan made me a deal.

06:29.546 --> 06:30.678
I do all the scut work.

06:30.852 --> 06:32.743
If the patient needs
anything surgical,

06:32.767 --> 06:34.396
- she'll put in a good
word with the attending.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.291
Even if there's a kidney stone,

06:35.465 --> 06:37.554
I mean, surgery's pretty unlikely.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.528
But what's that,
on the right kidney?

06:43.473 --> 06:45.214
That's a significant hypodensity.

06:45.388 --> 06:47.912
Could be a mass.
She needs a kidney biopsy.

06:48.086 --> 06:50.523
That is a legit
ultrasound-guided procedure.

06:50.698 --> 06:53.004
And it's mine.
All mine!

06:57.226 --> 06:58.401
Riley's throat...

06:58.575 --> 07:00.175
It's still really bothering him.

07:00.272 --> 07:02.187
We had to remove
additional tissue-

07:02.361 --> 07:05.361
- because your son's tonsils
showed signs of cancerous cells.

07:06.452 --> 07:07.976
Riley has cancer.

07:08.150 --> 07:09.736
The margins were clear,
which means that-

07:09.760 --> 07:11.433
- we were able to
remove all the cancer.

07:11.457 --> 07:12.807
His prognosis is excellent.

07:12.981 --> 07:16.767
But right now,
he's not our main concern.

07:16.941 --> 07:19.441
The cancer on your son's
tonsil is cervical cancer.

07:20.075 --> 07:21.424
What?

07:21.598 --> 07:22.338
That makes no sense.

07:22.512 --> 07:24.775
He got it from you.

07:24.949 --> 07:27.275
He was exposed to your
cancerous cells in the birth canal,

07:27.299 --> 07:28.997
- which he likely inhaled.

07:29.171 --> 07:30.888
Jackson may also have
been exposed during birth.

07:30.912 --> 07:32.870
We need to scan both you and...

07:33.044 --> 07:35.786
- Hey!
Hey, boys.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.110
- How you feeling, Riley?
- Hey, Uncle Nick.

07:38.615 --> 07:40.115
Why are you here?

07:43.141 --> 07:45.230
I texted Uncle Nick
that Riley was sick.

07:48.451 --> 07:49.757
Everything is fine.

07:49.931 --> 07:52.629
Thank you for the gift,
but if you could please...

07:52.803 --> 07:54.152
Sarah, I'm better.

07:54.326 --> 07:55.501
All right? I swear.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.765
And if you need anything,
I can help.

07:57.939 --> 07:59.767
Everything is gonna be fine.

07:59.941 --> 08:02.160
It was very nice
of Uncle Nick to visit,

08:02.334 --> 08:03.834
- but he needs to leave.

08:07.339 --> 08:08.906
Say goodbye.

08:17.175 --> 08:18.675
I love you, guys.

08:21.658 --> 08:23.158
Bye, Riley.

08:25.531 --> 08:27.446
Hey, uh...

08:27.620 --> 08:29.120
I need to talk to you.

08:29.274 --> 08:31.842
I'm sorry.
I just... No. No, no, no.

08:32.015 --> 08:34.216
You did nothing wrong, honey.
Nothing at all.

08:37.413 --> 08:38.913
But, um...

08:41.373 --> 08:42.592
The doctors and I...

08:42.765 --> 08:45.029
We need to talk to you.

08:53.037 --> 08:55.387
Imaging found an abnormal
lesion in your kidney.

08:56.519 --> 08:59.043
Now, it could be a benign growth,

08:59.217 --> 09:01.480
- but given your symptoms,

09:01.654 --> 09:03.354
- it could be
renal-cell carcinoma.

09:09.445 --> 09:12.622
We'll need to biopsy
the mass to be sure.

09:12.796 --> 09:15.581
- Who will be doing the procedure?
- Dr. Allen.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.556
She's an excellent surgical
resident, right, Dr. Andrews?

09:19.368 --> 09:21.109
Quite.

09:21.283 --> 09:23.478
And she'll be under my
supervision every step of the way.

09:23.502 --> 09:25.552
If that's acceptable to you,
Ms. Morrison.

09:25.678 --> 09:27.178
Of course.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.818
No eating or drinking
anything besides water-

09:34.992 --> 09:38.256
- between now and when
I do the procedure.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.873
Why did you lie to your brother?

09:47.526 --> 09:49.224
You said everything was fine.

09:49.398 --> 09:50.898
It's not.

09:54.446 --> 09:55.946
He just never grew up.

09:58.233 --> 10:01.279
When I decided to
become a single mom,

10:01.453 --> 10:03.586
- Nick wanted to help.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.260
He got on great with the kids.

10:06.241 --> 10:07.982
He also drank...

10:08.983 --> 10:10.483
Like our dad.

10:11.855 --> 10:13.639
One day about four years ago,

10:13.814 --> 10:15.714
- I had a job interview and no sitter.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.600
Nick insisted he'd help.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.646
He took the boys to the beach...

10:21.517 --> 10:23.017
And got drunk.

10:25.086 --> 10:26.827
Started chattin' up some girl,

10:27.001 --> 10:28.501
- then turned around.

10:30.221 --> 10:31.721
Boys were gone.

10:34.356 --> 10:38.012
The cops found them
about a mile down the beach.

10:42.103 --> 10:44.366
That's a good answer.

10:46.890 --> 10:48.390
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:51.982 --> 10:53.027
I heard about you and Isabel.

10:53.201 --> 10:54.550
Mmm-hmm.

10:54.724 --> 10:56.857
Sorry to hear that.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.336
Appreciate the sympathy.

10:58.510 --> 11:00.460
No need for us to
have a heart-to-heart.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.994
I've been there.

11:04.168 --> 11:05.668
Not recently.

11:09.173 --> 11:10.803
Breakup's a breakup.
How different can they be?

11:10.827 --> 11:12.327
I'm doing great.

11:15.571 --> 11:18.661
Taking this cute dietician
to Shaun and Lea's party.

11:20.315 --> 11:21.815
Marie.

11:23.013 --> 11:25.407
Or Annabelle or... Lydia.

11:25.581 --> 11:26.843
You don't remember her name?

11:27.017 --> 11:28.671
I don't know which one to take.

11:28.845 --> 11:30.605
- They're all dieticians?
- Two of them are.

11:30.629 --> 11:32.718
I got to check my notes.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.246
- How you doing?
- Good. Good. Really good.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.943
Good. Really good.

11:42.424 --> 11:44.469
I'm thinking of going on a diet.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.998
This one or this one?

11:51.172 --> 11:52.216
Wear whatever you want.
I don't care.

11:52.390 --> 11:53.130
I've got work.

11:53.304 --> 11:54.827
Oh, you do care.

11:55.002 --> 11:57.110
Who are you on the phone with now?
Caterer? Flowers?

11:57.134 --> 11:59.112
I'm on hold with our
cloud-backup people.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.878
They're just... Oh.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.552
Hello.

12:03.619 --> 12:05.838
Um, three more trays
of the bruschetta,

12:06.013 --> 12:09.463
- two more chicken satay for
Murphy/Dilallo tomorrow night. Thank you.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.432
Um...

12:13.498 --> 12:15.587
This one or this one?

12:15.761 --> 12:17.024
Number two.
Morgan's wearing green.

12:17.198 --> 12:18.698
- Excellent.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.657
Busy.

12:23.987 --> 12:25.032
If you're too busy
to answer the door,

12:25.206 --> 12:27.156
- I assume lunch
is out of the question?

12:27.251 --> 12:29.950
I ate at my desk half an hour ago.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.724
The hospital's bleeding more
money than actual blood.

12:32.778 --> 12:34.278
I'll be quick.

12:38.262 --> 12:41.918
I applied for a provisional
California medical license.

12:42.092 --> 12:43.592
My request was approved.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.619
An old medical-school
friend is a surgeon-

12:47.793 --> 12:49.293
- at San Francisco General.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.687
He's, uh...

12:52.102 --> 12:53.602
Offered me a job.

13:02.025 --> 13:04.506
As promised, very quick.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.811
I'll let you think.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.944
No, I just didn't know-

13:08.118 --> 13:10.118
- you were thinking
of leaving Guatemala.

13:13.645 --> 13:15.560
It is a bit fast, isn't it?

13:20.478 --> 13:21.978
Although...

13:22.654 --> 13:24.308
If we'd met here,

13:24.482 --> 13:27.572
- San Francisco would
seem far away, right?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.533
That is very true.

13:31.707 --> 13:35.102
So if I take this job,
we'll just have to deal-

13:35.276 --> 13:37.876
- with being so far away
from each other, am I right?

13:47.462 --> 13:49.333
I'm glad you are
no longer a fugitive-

13:49.507 --> 13:51.944
- from government authorities.

13:52.119 --> 13:54.947
The PET scan shows
increased metabolic activity-

13:55.122 --> 13:57.404
- in the mother's uterus
and the son's trachea.

13:57.428 --> 13:59.082
They both have cancer.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.174
I'm doing a biopsy today.

14:04.348 --> 14:06.437
Are you doing a biopsy today?

14:06.611 --> 14:08.211
'Cause I'm doing a biopsy today.

14:08.352 --> 14:10.983
Not many second-year residents
are doing biopsies today.

14:11.007 --> 14:12.356
No.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.402
I'm not doing a biopsy today.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.927
Are you?

14:23.976 --> 14:25.476
Hello?

14:27.284 --> 14:28.851
No. No, no.

14:29.025 --> 14:30.825
The flowers need
to be there by 5:00.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.204
If it's impossible,

14:34.378 --> 14:36.978
- then why did you commit
to that time two weeks ago?

14:38.339 --> 14:41.168
Okay.
I need to talk to my fiance.

14:41.342 --> 14:44.171
He's a lawyer,
and he gets really worked up-

14:44.345 --> 14:46.279
- when businesses don't
honor their agreements.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.107
It's actually kind of
a turn-on for him,

14:48.131 --> 14:50.220
- making people pay, uh...

14:51.700 --> 14:54.050
Oh. That's great.

14:54.224 --> 14:56.139
Yeah.
Thank you so much.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.813
Was any of that true?

14:59.229 --> 15:00.883
Either way, well done.

15:01.057 --> 15:02.319
What kind of flowers
are you getting?

15:02.493 --> 15:04.278
Gardenias.

15:04.452 --> 15:05.801
Are you a patient?

15:05.975 --> 15:07.475
I love gardenias.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.630
What's your P.U.E. ratio?

15:08.804 --> 15:09.979
1.4.

15:10.153 --> 15:12.000
You're not supposed
to be in here. Uh...

15:12.024 --> 15:13.591
Put down that sandwich!

15:13.765 --> 15:15.526
Hi, Dr. Allen.
Is it time for my biopsy?

15:15.550 --> 15:17.160
I told you not to eat.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.206
I forgot.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.339
That tends to happen
when I'm off my meds.

15:22.513 --> 15:23.601
Please tell me
that was going to be-

15:23.775 --> 15:25.475
- your first bite
of that sandwich.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.060
My first bite.

15:27.605 --> 15:29.105
Of this half.

15:33.437 --> 15:34.743
Your cancer appears to be-

15:34.917 --> 15:37.659
- primarily localized to
the cervix and uterus.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.227
You will need a
radical hysterectomy.

15:40.401 --> 15:42.751
If the cancer's spread
to the lymph nodes,

15:42.925 --> 15:44.231
- you would also
need those removed-

15:44.405 --> 15:47.059
- and post-radiation and
possibly chemotherapy.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.454
And Jackson?

15:50.628 --> 15:52.728
When was the last time
you had a Pap smear?

15:54.676 --> 15:57.896
Your cancer is quite advanced.

15:58.070 --> 16:00.070
Most cervical cancers
are detected early-

16:00.116 --> 16:01.616
- with regular Pap smears.

16:02.597 --> 16:04.251
I'm a single mom.

16:04.425 --> 16:06.425
Things sometimes fall
through the cracks.

16:07.558 --> 16:09.473
How's my son?

16:09.647 --> 16:12.128
Jackson has a tumor in his trachea.

16:12.302 --> 16:14.565
There appears to be just one lesion,

16:14.739 --> 16:16.789
- no lymph-node
involvement or metastasis.

16:16.828 --> 16:18.700
Surgery will hopefully be curative.

16:18.874 --> 16:20.441
And how soon can you do that?

16:20.615 --> 16:23.183
There's no rush to do it.
It's slow-growing.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.533
But there is a rush
to do your surgery.

16:27.099 --> 16:28.599
Waiting increases your risk-

16:28.753 --> 16:31.495
- of serious bowel
injury and metastasis.

16:31.669 --> 16:33.541
How long will my recovery take?

16:33.715 --> 16:35.804
If all goes well...

16:35.978 --> 16:37.478
A month.

16:37.806 --> 16:39.306
No.

16:39.808 --> 16:41.157
I can't.

16:41.331 --> 16:43.203
Who will look after the boys?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.006
I... I can't afford a full-time sitter.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.530
There's no one that I can ask.

16:50.993 --> 16:53.038
Jackson's surgery should go first.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.562
And once he's better,
you can do mine.

16:54.736 --> 16:57.521
Jackson's recovery
won't be quick either.

16:57.695 --> 16:59.804
He may need to remain
intubated while his trachea heals.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.177
He won't be able to eat.

17:01.351 --> 17:03.353
We'll need to put
a tube in his belly.

17:03.527 --> 17:05.201
You can help me in a month.
Right now...

17:05.224 --> 17:06.724
You help my son.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.944
Thank you.

17:26.984 --> 17:28.509
Are you okay?

17:28.683 --> 17:30.183
The engagement party is off.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.991
Another bad dream?

17:33.165 --> 17:36.734
Another reminder that chaos
follows me everywhere.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.258
Is the wedding still on?

17:38.432 --> 17:39.433
Yeah.

17:39.607 --> 17:41.107
Okay.

17:44.002 --> 17:45.526
Stupid choice.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.049
It's not stupid to sacrifice
yourself for your child.

17:47.223 --> 17:48.311
It's being a parent.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.313
Call it whatever you want.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.793
We can't force her
to do the surgery.

17:51.967 --> 17:53.901
So we're gonna have to
do Jackson's surgery first-

17:53.925 --> 17:55.579
- and hope for a smooth recovery.

17:55.753 --> 17:57.253
You're wrong.

18:05.981 --> 18:08.157
Endoscopic mucosal
tracheal resection.

18:11.769 --> 18:14.095
If Jackson's tumor was seeded
via exposure during birth,

18:14.119 --> 18:15.793
- which is a very
reasonable assumption,

18:15.817 --> 18:17.534
- then we can reasonably
assume that it is localized.

18:17.558 --> 18:19.231
Endoscopic resection should allow-

18:19.255 --> 18:21.305
- for a recovery of days
instead of weeks.

18:23.694 --> 18:25.194
Talk to the mother.

18:29.047 --> 18:30.222
We have rescheduled
your kidney biopsy-

18:30.397 --> 18:31.897
- for 6:00 this evening.

18:32.007 --> 18:35.227
Nothing to eat or drink
between now and then.

18:35.402 --> 18:38.206
Ms. Morrison, could you stop
doing that while we're talking?

18:38.230 --> 18:39.580
This helps me relax.

18:39.754 --> 18:41.451
I don't care if you're relaxed.

18:41.625 --> 18:42.931
I care about the wandering,
the eating,

18:43.105 --> 18:45.325
- and the not listening.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.259
- I'm listening.
- Repeat what he just said.

18:47.283 --> 18:49.807
You've rescheduled
my biopsy for 6:00.

18:49.981 --> 18:52.941
Nothing to eat
or drink until then.

18:53.115 --> 18:55.789
Is your relationship primarily
cooperative or competitive?

18:55.813 --> 18:57.313
- Cooperative.
- Competitive.

18:59.600 --> 19:03.050
He said that because he doesn't
want to appear competitive in front...

19:05.301 --> 19:06.851
Have you always had fat ankles?

19:07.521 --> 19:09.021
Rude!

19:09.174 --> 19:10.393
Only if the answer is "yes."

19:10.567 --> 19:12.417
If the answer is "no,"
it's a symptom.

19:19.010 --> 19:22.100
This endoscopic approach,

19:22.274 --> 19:24.973
- it's, um, not
the normal surgery?

19:25.147 --> 19:27.584
There is no normal
surgery for removing-

19:27.758 --> 19:30.065
- cervical cancer
from a child's trachea.

19:30.239 --> 19:31.414
Is it just as safe?

19:31.588 --> 19:33.088
Safer.

19:35.636 --> 19:37.136
Overall.

19:38.639 --> 19:41.381
It's slightly more
dangerous for Jackson,

19:41.555 --> 19:43.557
- but much less dangerous for you.

19:43.731 --> 19:46.318
We would need emergent ECMO,
but we can prep for that,

19:46.342 --> 19:48.102
- and his recovery should be shorter.

19:48.126 --> 19:49.824
So... No.

19:49.998 --> 19:51.826
No.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.500
I'm sorry.

19:56.918 --> 19:59.287
I'm sorry for giving a
hard time with Uncle Nick.

19:59.311 --> 20:01.488
Oh...

20:01.662 --> 20:03.490
I'm sorry for giving a hard time-

20:03.664 --> 20:05.448
- with cleaning up after dinner,

20:05.622 --> 20:07.319
- fighting with Riley.

20:08.712 --> 20:10.366
I know how much you do for us.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.021
And I know after the surgery,

20:13.195 --> 20:15.445
- you won't be able
to do all of those things.

20:18.374 --> 20:19.874
I can help.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.689
I love you.

20:31.474 --> 20:33.215
I love you, too.

20:34.738 --> 20:37.349
And if anything
ever happened to you...

20:37.524 --> 20:38.481
Oh...

20:38.655 --> 20:40.396
I... I'm...

20:40.570 --> 20:42.070
Hey.

20:49.884 --> 20:51.384
Okay.

20:53.844 --> 20:56.804
Swollen ankles could indicate
an infectious abscess,

20:56.978 --> 20:59.304
- which could be the lesion
we saw on her kidney imaging.

20:59.328 --> 21:01.132
In which case, poking the
mass with a biopsy needle-

21:01.156 --> 21:02.287
- is a terrible idea.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.985
Could seed the infection.

21:04.159 --> 21:07.075
So no biopsy.

21:07.249 --> 21:09.183
You'll be relieved to know
that even if there was a biopsy,

21:09.207 --> 21:10.707
- you wouldn't be doing it.

21:10.818 --> 21:12.970
Second-year residents who
have to reschedule procedures-

21:12.994 --> 21:14.299
- because they allow their patients-

21:14.474 --> 21:15.692
- to wander off to eat sandwiches...

21:15.866 --> 21:19.043
...don't get dibs.

21:19.217 --> 21:21.805
Let's recheck C.B.C., E.S.R.,
blood and urine cultures,

21:21.829 --> 21:23.720
- and then start her on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

21:23.744 --> 21:25.678
If her symptoms improve,
then it's an infection,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.202
- which would be good news.

21:31.012 --> 21:32.361
How cooperative
you feeling right now?

21:32.535 --> 21:34.537
I'm really... sorry.

21:39.411 --> 21:40.717
You're at the mass.

21:40.891 --> 21:44.416
It has a wide base.

21:44.591 --> 21:46.491
No easy way to loop
my snare around it.

21:47.376 --> 21:49.378
Is it... pulsating?

21:54.557 --> 21:56.864
It has a major arterial
feeder from his aorta.

21:57.038 --> 21:59.388
We can't remove it from this angle-

21:59.562 --> 22:01.212
- without risking
a massive bleed.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.570
It was a good idea
that won't work.

22:12.009 --> 22:13.509
Abort the surgery.

22:22.063 --> 22:24.239
Ta-da!

22:24.413 --> 22:26.371
You look amazing!

22:26.546 --> 22:28.112
But wait.

22:28.286 --> 22:29.592
You shouldn't look amazing.
The party's canceled.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.376
I do not accept that, not today.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.529
I look amazing,
and people need to see that.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.642
And unless you
caught Shaun cheating,

22:35.816 --> 22:37.078
- no way you should be here sulking-

22:37.252 --> 22:39.652
- instead of having a party
where I look amazing.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.866
Did you catch Shaun cheating?

22:43.040 --> 22:44.540
No! Of course not.

22:44.607 --> 22:46.407
Are you worried
about marrying Shaun?

22:46.478 --> 22:48.655
No, not at all.

22:48.829 --> 22:51.309
I just want this
wedding to be perfect.

22:51.483 --> 22:53.921
And the party was
going to be a trial run.

22:54.095 --> 22:55.139
It wasn't going to be perfect.

22:55.313 --> 22:56.924
It was going to be a disaster.

22:57.098 --> 22:58.998
No.
It just wasn't going to be perfect.

23:06.063 --> 23:08.457
The first time I got married...

23:11.852 --> 23:14.419
...I was all about it
being spontaneous-

23:14.594 --> 23:17.379
- and romantic and fun.

23:19.163 --> 23:20.861
The deejay was an hour late.

23:21.035 --> 23:23.211
We ran out of booze,
the food was cold,

23:23.385 --> 23:25.015
- and, somehow,
there were no napkins,

23:25.039 --> 23:26.539
- not a single one.

23:28.172 --> 23:30.272
It was a disaster,
and so was the marriage.

23:31.828 --> 23:35.440
So I-I really need
to get this one right.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.707
If you aren't willing to risk-

23:40.881 --> 23:42.381
- little things going wrong,

23:43.797 --> 23:45.297
- you'll never get the chance-

23:45.450 --> 23:47.235
- to have the big things go right.

23:52.283 --> 23:53.783
E-mail everyone-

23:53.850 --> 23:55.600
- and tell them
the party's back on.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.354
Then I'm doing your hair.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.313
MMm.

24:02.685 --> 24:04.335
If we avoid an
abdominal incision,

24:04.469 --> 24:06.273
- that'd reduce
Sarah's recovery time,

24:06.297 --> 24:08.188
- which might convince her to
let us do her procedure first.

24:08.212 --> 24:10.190
There may be uterine
adhesions to the bladder.

24:10.214 --> 24:12.477
That makes a laparoscopic
removal difficult.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.741
You two, get changed.

24:14.915 --> 24:16.415
Engagement party's back on.

24:16.525 --> 24:19.180
We are working on a case.

24:19.354 --> 24:21.617
Your fiancEe is working
on a celebration-

24:21.791 --> 24:23.291
- of your future together.

24:25.447 --> 24:26.535
Is someone going to die-

24:26.709 --> 24:28.609
- if you don't figure
this out tonight?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.170
Maybe.

24:33.020 --> 24:35.065
Not good enough.
See you at the party.

24:35.239 --> 24:36.739
Talk some sense into him.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.161
We will solve this problem-

24:44.335 --> 24:46.250
- and then go to the party.

24:46.424 --> 24:48.874
It won't take very long.
We are both quite clever.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.743
The food is happening,

25:00.917 --> 25:02.702
- bubbly is flowing,

25:02.876 --> 25:05.008
- flower arrangements
are in position.

25:05.182 --> 25:06.793
The deejay wouldn't uncancel,

25:06.967 --> 25:09.578
- so we're streaming
chill jazz on your phone.

25:09.752 --> 25:12.059
- You're amazing.
- Oh.

25:12.233 --> 25:13.833
Congratulations, Lea.
Hi, Jordan.

25:13.930 --> 25:14.931
Thank you.

25:15.105 --> 25:16.705
So, where's the man of the hour?

25:18.543 --> 25:21.590
Shaun's getting into his
party duds as we speak.

25:21.764 --> 25:24.064
Got to make sure he
measures up to this beauty.

25:38.041 --> 25:40.261
I got it. I know how
to do Jackson's surgery-

25:40.435 --> 25:41.131
- without cracking his chest.

25:41.305 --> 25:42.805
How?

25:43.090 --> 25:44.613
It's complicated.

25:44.787 --> 25:46.417
I've seen journal
articles that support it,

25:46.441 --> 25:47.941
- and I need to pull them.

25:48.008 --> 25:50.108
You go ahead.
I'll put everything together.

25:50.184 --> 25:54.318
Are you lying
about having a solution?

25:57.669 --> 25:59.169
Is your future with Lea-

25:59.323 --> 26:01.073
- more important
than this one case?

26:01.978 --> 26:03.719
Much more.

26:03.893 --> 26:05.765
Then do you really
want me to answer?

26:11.335 --> 26:13.792
Well, where's Shaun?
I'd like to toast the two of you.

26:13.816 --> 26:14.861
I've got to take this.

26:15.035 --> 26:16.210
Yeah.
Shaun?

26:16.384 --> 26:19.082
Shaun?

26:19.256 --> 26:20.973
- Shaun?
- This is not a little thing.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.782
Paging
Dr. Shaun Murphy!

26:24.218 --> 26:25.718
Stop yelling.

26:35.882 --> 26:38.362
We are all so happy for you.

26:38.536 --> 26:40.756
The first time
Shaun mentioned Lea,

26:40.930 --> 26:43.628
- she was the girl who
borrowed his batteries.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.022
I told him not to
ask for them back,

26:46.196 --> 26:48.590
- but clearly, it worked out.

26:48.764 --> 26:50.614
These two have a
love that can move...

27:02.038 --> 27:04.103
What if we embolize the
blood supply to the tumor-

27:04.127 --> 27:05.844
- and then do the
endoscopic surgery?

27:05.868 --> 27:07.696
If Shaun couldn't figure this out,

27:07.870 --> 27:09.620
- you really think you're going to?

27:09.741 --> 27:11.284
I was hoping you
might help, you know,

27:11.308 --> 27:13.658
- instead of just throwing insults.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.811
Even if you come up
with a brilliant idea,

27:15.835 --> 27:17.335
- it still won't work.

27:17.488 --> 27:19.292
If medical logic was
gonna persuade her,

27:19.316 --> 27:21.166
- she'd have changed
her mind already.

27:43.297 --> 27:44.797
This is perfect.

27:46.300 --> 27:47.800
Yes, it is.

28:04.840 --> 28:05.928
Uh...

28:06.102 --> 28:07.625
Um...

28:07.799 --> 28:09.549
Look, I know you
don't want me here.

28:12.456 --> 28:13.956
I have something for you.

28:23.163 --> 28:25.687
This is my 90-day chip.

28:25.861 --> 28:28.342
I haven't had a drink
in 106 days, and...

28:30.126 --> 28:32.026
Not my first time
getting sober, but...

28:35.479 --> 28:37.429
...I want to be the
man I know I can be.

28:40.658 --> 28:42.258
I want to be your brother again.

28:45.707 --> 28:47.207
You keep it.

28:50.799 --> 28:52.801
And whatever you all
are going through,

28:52.975 --> 28:55.425
- it'll be here, just like
I'll be here for you...

28:56.326 --> 28:57.826
And for the boys...

28:59.590 --> 29:01.090
If you'll let me.

29:08.904 --> 29:11.820
I'm...
Glad you're doing better.

29:13.039 --> 29:14.539
Really.

29:18.044 --> 29:19.959
But how do I know
I can trust you?

29:22.657 --> 29:24.157
No, you don't.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.270
But...

29:27.444 --> 29:30.012
Sarah, you need
to trust someone.

29:47.247 --> 29:50.293
♪ You've got me right ♪
♪ where you want ♪

29:50.467 --> 29:52.382
♪ I've got... ♪

29:52.556 --> 29:54.534
You couldn't decide, so
you ended up with two dates?

29:54.558 --> 29:57.474
I got Marie and Maria
confused in my text threads-

29:57.648 --> 29:59.348
- and inadvertently double-dipped.

30:03.785 --> 30:05.676
Well, it seems like
it's going okay so far.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.808
Oh, yeah. They're talking
about moving on to a club...

30:07.832 --> 30:09.138
Without me.

30:09.312 --> 30:10.812
They do have real chemistry.

30:12.054 --> 30:14.535
How about a double?

30:15.666 --> 30:17.166
Yes, please.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.890
♪ Tell me, tell me ♪

30:22.064 --> 30:24.197
♪ Tell me what can I do ♪

30:27.113 --> 30:28.613
Excuse me.

30:31.726 --> 30:33.336
That was SF General.

30:33.510 --> 30:35.210
Once the hospital board found out-

30:35.295 --> 30:37.229
- that my original
charges included assault,

30:37.253 --> 30:39.908
- they decided I was too
big of an insurance risk.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.420
Maybe another hospital
in the Bay Area.

30:47.350 --> 30:49.135
Yeah.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.219
Uh, I would like to, um...
Make a toast.

30:58.709 --> 31:00.581
Uh...

31:00.755 --> 31:02.844
I have known Shaun-

31:03.888 --> 31:05.388
- since he was...

31:05.673 --> 31:07.173
Littler.

31:08.719 --> 31:10.939
And, Shaun,

31:11.113 --> 31:12.636
- I have never, ever seen you-

31:12.810 --> 31:15.552
- as happy as you are-

31:15.726 --> 31:17.226
- right now with Lea.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.550
Well, not that you've
always been happy.

31:22.864 --> 31:24.822
There have been
some ups and downs,

31:24.996 --> 31:26.626
- a little bit like a roller coaster.

31:26.650 --> 31:30.132
But you guys have
managed it so well.

31:32.221 --> 31:33.771
A whole lot better than I have.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.596
Is that funny?

31:42.971 --> 31:44.471
Anyway, um...

31:46.670 --> 31:50.326
But here's to many,
many, many years of...

31:52.807 --> 31:54.307
...of happiness.

31:57.768 --> 31:59.268
At least two, maybe three.

32:02.947 --> 32:04.447
That was funny.

32:04.558 --> 32:05.863
I'm divorced, so that's funny.

32:06.037 --> 32:07.537
Yeah, but you're married now,

32:07.648 --> 32:08.779
- so let's give it up for Shaun...

32:08.953 --> 32:10.216
Debbie left me
like two months ago,

32:10.390 --> 32:12.490
- but that's not the point.
The point is...

32:13.654 --> 32:16.831
You guys have built a-a platform-

32:17.005 --> 32:18.505
- and you've taken off.

32:20.574 --> 32:22.074
And that's...

32:26.754 --> 32:28.930
I mean, who knows?

32:33.108 --> 32:34.979
And, so...

33:45.702 --> 33:47.574
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah.

33:49.663 --> 33:51.263
You want to grab some breakfast?

33:52.143 --> 33:53.643
I should get going.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.300
Yeah.

34:11.902 --> 34:13.426
What's on your mind, guapa?

34:14.382 --> 34:16.080
Well...

34:16.255 --> 34:18.735
Radical hysterectomy with
lymph-node resection-

34:18.909 --> 34:20.911
- on a mom of two boys.

34:21.085 --> 34:22.715
I'm just worried
about incontinence-

34:22.739 --> 34:24.239
- and fistula post-procedure.

34:26.351 --> 34:28.552
Can you preserve the
superior vesical artery?

34:30.791 --> 34:33.291
That will ensure blood
supply to the distal ureter.

34:37.145 --> 34:38.886
Is that all you're thinking about?

34:39.060 --> 34:41.322
No.

34:49.244 --> 34:50.766
It's still swollen,

34:50.940 --> 34:52.072
- but blood and urine
cultures are negative.

34:52.246 --> 34:53.509
Rules out infection.

34:53.683 --> 34:55.032
Well, it rules out
bacterial infection.

34:55.206 --> 34:56.906
It could still be fungal or viral.

34:56.947 --> 34:59.863
We're better off with an
endovascular renal biopsy.

35:00.037 --> 35:02.257
Ms. Morrison,
we'd like to insert a catheter-

35:02.431 --> 35:04.322
- through your jugular
vein to your kidney.

35:04.346 --> 35:06.296
That way,
we can biopsy the mass safely.

35:06.435 --> 35:07.741
Okay.

35:07.915 --> 35:09.612
Will you be doing it?

35:09.786 --> 35:11.536
Dr. Wolke will be doing the honors,

35:11.571 --> 35:12.833
- under my guidance.

35:13.007 --> 35:14.507
Great.

35:17.403 --> 35:18.534
Who's the chief of surgery here?

35:18.708 --> 35:20.319
Dr. Audrey Lim.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.233
A woman.
That's fantastic.

35:23.713 --> 35:25.213
Can I meet her?

35:25.715 --> 35:28.065
She's a little busy.

35:28.239 --> 35:31.139
Dr. Murphy, can you identify
the superior vesical arteries?

35:31.286 --> 35:32.331
Yes.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.594
W-Why?

35:34.768 --> 35:37.988
Salvage them. It will ensure
blood supply to the distal ureter.

35:38.162 --> 35:41.296
That will reduce the risk
of incontinence or fistula.

35:41.470 --> 35:42.428
Very clever.

35:42.602 --> 35:44.212
It is, isn't it?

35:44.386 --> 35:45.886
Dr. Lim!

35:46.519 --> 35:48.216
Excuse me.
Who are you?

35:48.390 --> 35:49.609
And what are you doing
in my operating room?

35:49.783 --> 35:51.785
I'm Salen Morrison.

35:51.959 --> 35:54.981
Dr. Andrews thinks I should have
an endovascular kidney biopsy.

35:55.005 --> 35:56.505
What do you think?

35:57.530 --> 35:59.280
It's absolutely the best next step.

35:59.445 --> 36:01.074
But what about the possibility of...

36:01.098 --> 36:02.989
Ms. Morrison, I don't know
anything about your case.

36:03.013 --> 36:05.165
But if Dr. Andrews
recommends you get a biopsy,

36:05.189 --> 36:06.930
- then get a biopsy.

36:07.104 --> 36:09.474
I have complete faith in him
and all of my attendings.

36:09.498 --> 36:10.998
Please page Dr. Andrews-

36:11.065 --> 36:12.815
- and have him
come get his patient.

36:15.286 --> 36:17.332
Oh, I feel...

36:19.552 --> 36:20.422
Something's wrong.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.206
Stat.

36:26.689 --> 36:29.039
What causes kidney lesions,
shortness of breath,

36:29.126 --> 36:31.061
- swollen ankles,
and heart irregularities?

36:31.085 --> 36:32.782
Early polycystic kidney disease?

36:32.956 --> 36:35.326
See, we're just guessing.
We need to sample the lesion.

36:35.350 --> 36:37.502
Every time we get close to
doing the biopsy on this woman,

36:37.526 --> 36:39.441
- something... doc-blocks us.

36:39.615 --> 36:41.487
It's like she's messing with us.

36:41.661 --> 36:44.490
Whatever's in her
kidney is very real,

36:44.664 --> 36:46.013
- and she didn't intentionally
make her heart rate-

36:46.187 --> 36:47.837
- go through the roof.
- Unless...

36:50.626 --> 36:51.410
Look at her blood work.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.716
She said she'd stop her meds,

36:53.890 --> 36:56.173
- but her Ritalin level today is
over double when she came in.

36:56.197 --> 36:58.417
That could cause
her heart irregularities.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.419
She is messing with us.

37:19.873 --> 37:21.373
You look great.

37:24.399 --> 37:27.184
Yeah, Jackson's asleep,
but, um, he's doing good.

37:29.839 --> 37:31.667
Your surgery went well.

37:31.841 --> 37:33.341
Your prognosis is good.

37:35.018 --> 37:37.368
You'll receive
chemo-radiation treatment.

37:37.543 --> 37:39.695
The radiation therapy
includes both external beam...

37:39.719 --> 37:41.285
Thank you.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.960
You're welcome.

37:44.158 --> 37:45.658
I think she was talking to me.

37:46.726 --> 37:48.423
Because you brought Nick.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.996
Your brother is not perfect.

37:59.913 --> 38:01.001
But sometimes,

38:01.175 --> 38:03.220
- we need people
who aren't perfect.

38:15.319 --> 38:16.277
I forgot.

38:16.451 --> 38:17.539
You do that a lot.

38:17.713 --> 38:18.801
This is silly.

38:18.975 --> 38:21.127
You must have patients
all the time who screw up,

38:21.151 --> 38:22.651
- don't do what they're told.

38:22.718 --> 38:23.937
Do you accuse all of
them of being liars?

38:24.111 --> 38:26.132
- I didn't think you're a liar.
- Thank you.

38:26.156 --> 38:27.897
I think you are insane.

38:28.071 --> 38:29.986
There's a lesion on your kidney,

38:30.160 --> 38:31.379
- and you're actively
preventing us-

38:31.553 --> 38:32.598
- from finding out what it is.

38:32.772 --> 38:34.513
Or she already knows.

38:41.824 --> 38:43.434
Or at least she knows enough-

38:43.609 --> 38:45.741
- to put concealing
makeup on her fingers.

38:54.315 --> 38:56.099
To hide her Raynaud's syndrome.

38:57.579 --> 39:00.321
You have scleroderma?

39:00.495 --> 39:01.995
So your kidney...

39:02.932 --> 39:05.108
That's a benign lesion, not a mass.

39:07.807 --> 39:09.678
I got diagnosed seven years ago,

39:11.375 --> 39:13.325
- after having symptoms
for three years.

39:14.857 --> 39:16.598
Lots of bad doctors out there.

39:19.253 --> 39:21.703
I went off my scleroderma
meds a couple weeks ago,

39:21.864 --> 39:23.929
- see if you doctors
were more of the same.

39:23.953 --> 39:25.453
Why?

39:28.001 --> 39:30.090
I was curious.

39:32.266 --> 39:33.833
How do I look?

39:34.007 --> 39:36.879
You look like someone-

39:37.053 --> 39:39.621
- about to make a presentation
to a hospital board.

39:39.795 --> 39:41.295
Perfect.

39:41.971 --> 39:43.538
I'm gonna go to my hotel room.

39:43.712 --> 39:44.931
No, no.
Don't you dare.

39:45.105 --> 39:46.691
Either the board is gonna make this-

39:46.715 --> 39:49.544
- a very good night
or a very bad night.

39:49.718 --> 39:51.218
But, either way,

39:51.372 --> 39:52.591
- I want you here
when I get home.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.265
Okay.

39:57.117 --> 39:59.119
You know, we have
been down an attending-

39:59.293 --> 40:01.730
- for over a year.

40:01.904 --> 40:04.167
And I do know a very
qualified candidate.

40:06.561 --> 40:08.737
If the board gives me the money,

40:08.911 --> 40:10.411
- I'm gonna offer you a job.

40:12.306 --> 40:14.917
And if they don't, screw 'em.

40:15.091 --> 40:16.658
I'm gonna offer you a job.

40:34.371 --> 40:36.199
The party was a disaster.

40:38.593 --> 40:40.377
Yeah.

40:40.551 --> 40:41.857
Yeah, it was.

40:42.031 --> 40:43.554
I'm sorry.

40:43.729 --> 40:45.295
I screwed up.

40:45.469 --> 40:47.123
Shaun, that was not your fault.

40:47.297 --> 40:48.951
Oh, no, I know.

40:49.125 --> 40:51.075
It wasn't my fault at all.
It was yours.

40:52.476 --> 40:54.304
It was your party,

40:54.478 --> 40:56.611
- your responsibility,

40:56.785 --> 40:58.285
- but that's the problem.

40:59.440 --> 41:02.269
When things go wrong for us,

41:02.443 --> 41:04.401
- they should go
wrong for both of us.

41:08.318 --> 41:10.712
So I'm going to help
you plan our wedding.

41:13.410 --> 41:14.977
This way...

41:15.151 --> 41:17.240
When it goes terribly wrong,

41:17.414 --> 41:19.634
- it will be both our faults.

41:23.464 --> 41:27.642
And it'll be because
of the both of us-

41:27.816 --> 41:29.513
- when everything goes right.

41:55.148 --> 41:57.672
What happened?
The meeting's over?

41:57.846 --> 42:00.259
But my presentation...
I haven't had a chance... No one has.

42:00.283 --> 42:03.069
There was only one
item on the agenda.

42:03.243 --> 42:04.897
The hospital is being purchased.

42:06.376 --> 42:07.876
What? By who?

42:14.428 --> 42:16.778
I'm looking forward to
working with both of you.
