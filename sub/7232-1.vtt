09:40.579 --> 09:43.082
AND IT'S--SWEET TOOTH!

09:43.165 --> 09:44.750
THE PRESIDENT!
- WHAT?

09:44.834 --> 09:48.004
- HE'S TRAPPED IN SOME SORT
OF DEVIOUS ALIEN DEVICE.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.547
- HAM SALAD.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.382
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING
ON THE PARABOLIC MIC.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.800
- [high-pitched shriek]

09:52.883 --> 09:54.593
- UH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.261
SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.263
- [high-pitched shriek]

09:57.346 --> 09:59.724
- NO, BOB,
THAT'S OUR PRESIDENT.

09:59.807 --> 10:03.352
- LINK,
WE ARE GOING IN HOT!

10:03.436 --> 10:04.854
- [high-pitched laughing]

10:04.937 --> 10:05.855
I LOVE THIS THING!

10:05.938 --> 10:09.191
- EVERYBODY LOVES
A FUN BUBBLE.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.609
- I'M NOT WILD ABOUT IT.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.820
- OH, PLEASE, GENERAL.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.904
YOUR LEADER IS--

10:13.988 --> 10:15.156
- ABOUT TO BE RESCUED
BY TEAM MONSTER!

10:15.239 --> 10:18.868
- MONSTERS, NO!

10:18.951 --> 10:21.746
- [screams]

10:25.166 --> 10:28.794
- WHEE!

10:28.878 --> 10:30.296
WHOO! YEAH!

10:30.379 --> 10:31.881
EVERYBODY RUMBA!
[explosion]

10:31.964 --> 10:33.257
- MONSTERS, STAND DOWN!

10:33.341 --> 10:34.467
- IGNORE THE GENERAL.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.260
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
UNDER THE ALIEN FIEND'S

10:36.344 --> 10:37.720
MIND CONTROL.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.929
- [yelps]

10:39.013 --> 10:40.473
[groans]

10:40.556 --> 10:42.892
- THIS IS FOR EARTH'S
MOST-DOMINANT SPECIES.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.727
[light slap]
- YEAH, HUMANKIND! WHOO!

10:44.810 --> 10:46.479
- ACTUALLY,
I WAS THINKING OF COCKROACHES,

10:46.562 --> 10:48.898
BUT WHATEVER.
[light slap]

10:48.981 --> 10:52.068
- WE GOT YOU,
MR. PRESIDENT.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.110
- [screams]

10:53.194 --> 10:55.071
OOF!

10:55.154 --> 10:57.573
[groans]

10:57.656 --> 10:59.992
DID YOU...
CHANGE YOUR HAIR?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.160
- MR. PRESIDENT,
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.996
MONSTERS HAVE
THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.999
- [laughs]
WHOO!

11:07.083 --> 11:09.377
- [groans]
- RIGHT?

11:16.675 --> 11:19.387
- [kisses]

11:19.470 --> 11:20.679
- WHAT WERE
YOU MONSTERS THINKING?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.057
- I WASN'T.
NO BRAIN!

11:23.140 --> 11:26.018
- WE SAW AN ALIEN.
IN ALL PROBABILITY, EVIL.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.312
- SO YOU JUST RUN IN
AND GIVE THE OL' ONE TWO?

11:28.396 --> 11:29.772
- YEP!
WHEN IT COMES TO ALIENS,

11:29.855 --> 11:30.940
THE OL' ONE TWO
IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.858
THAT'S WHAT LINK SAYS.
RIGHT, BUDDY?

11:32.942 --> 11:36.570
- YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE SAID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.905
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE CYLINDER

11:37.988 --> 11:39.698
THAT SLURPED UP
ALL MY QUANTONIUM?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.867
- SOUNDS LIKE
A STRAY BALGARBIAN PROBE.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.371
THEY'RE ALWAYS LEAVING THOSE
ABOUT THE GALAXY.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.581
- SO IT WASN'T
ONE OF YOURS?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.208
- [scoffs]
OF COURSE NOT.

11:49.291 --> 11:53.003
[warbling tone]

11:53.087 --> 11:54.422
SIMPLE COINCIDENCE.

11:54.505 --> 11:59.802
MR. PRESIDENT, I FEEL UNSAFE
WITH THESE MONSTERS AROUND.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.847
MAYBE I'LL COME BACK
WHEN YOU'RE READY, IN A...

12:02.930 --> 12:04.473
CENTURY OR TWO.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.599
- BUT--BUT I WON'T
BE PRESIDENT THEN!

12:05.683 --> 12:08.185
WHAT IF I GOT RID
OF THE MONSTERS?

12:08.269 --> 12:09.520
all: WHAT?

12:09.603 --> 12:11.730
- YOU MEAN KICKED THEM
TO THE CURB?

12:11.814 --> 12:12.356
- THEY'RE OUT OF HERE.
[all gasp]

12:12.440 --> 12:14.316
THEY ARE SO FIRED.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.651
- MR. PRESIDENT,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

12:15.734 --> 12:18.195
- JUST DID.
I DECIDED.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.530
I'M THE DECIDER-ER.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.657
SO IT'S DECIDER-ED.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.410
IT'S ALIENS IN
AND MONSTERS OUT.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.370
- YAY!

12:26.454 --> 12:29.290
WAIT, BOO?

12:29.373 --> 12:32.334
BOO!

12:32.418 --> 12:34.670
- PLEASE, GENERAL.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.839
MAYBE YOU COULD GET
THE PRESIDENT TO RECONSIDER.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.090
- ARE THEY STILL HERE?

12:38.174 --> 12:41.010
- HI, MR. PRESIDENT!

12:41.677 --> 12:44.180
- SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.141
I KINDA HAVE
A LIMITED SKILL SET.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.157
- MR. PRESIDENT,

13:03.240 --> 13:06.202
WELCOME TO THE POWER CENTER
OF THIS SHIP.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.996
BUT PLEASE, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.957
THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE VERY--
[loud beep]

13:12.041 --> 13:13.250
NO--
- I TOUCHED.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.376
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.337
- WHAT IN BLUE BLAZES?

13:16.420 --> 13:20.007
- OH, DEAR.
[yelps]

13:20.090 --> 13:21.884
[groans]

13:21.967 --> 13:24.053
HE ACTIVATED
THE SELF-DEFENSE MODE!

13:24.136 --> 13:26.347
FLEE!
FLEE FOR YOUR LIFE!

13:26.430 --> 13:29.016
[lasers blasting]

13:32.478 --> 13:34.980
- WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.690
WE'RE MONSTERS
WITHOUT A CAUSE.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.943
- YES, WE DO
SEEM FAIRLY POINTLESS.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.402
- YOU WANT POINTLESS?

13:40.486 --> 13:44.949
I'M NOT EVEN SURE I QUALIFY
AS A MONSTER ANYMORE.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.952
- I'M NOT POINTLESS,
BUT I KINDA WISH I WAS.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.788
[explosion]

13:50.871 --> 13:54.083
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- GIVE YOU ONE GUESS.

13:58.003 --> 13:58.963
- GO, GO!

13:59.046 --> 14:01.382
THE PRESIDENT
IS TRAPPED IN THERE.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.926
UH-OH.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.053
[battle cry]

14:13.602 --> 14:14.603
DO SOMETHING!

14:14.687 --> 14:16.230
IT'S YOUR DAG-BURNED
SPACE SHIP!

14:16.313 --> 14:18.691
- YES, YES,
I'M WORKING ON IT.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.235
MR. PRESIDENT,
THE SELF-DEFENSE MODE

14:21.318 --> 14:23.445
CAN BE DEACTIVATED
WITH A SIMPLE CODE.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.156
- GOTCHA.
HIT ME WITH THAT CODE.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.409
- THE FIRST LETTER
IS ZRUB.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.660
- ZRUB?

14:29.743 --> 14:31.036
- IT'S THE ONE
THAT LOOKS A BIT

14:31.120 --> 14:34.164
LIKE AN UPSIDE-DOWN
ICE CREAM CONE THAT'S ON FIRE.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.791
- UH, HOW ABOUT ONE
THAT'S SORT OF

14:35.874 --> 14:37.626
A THREE-LEGGED WOLVERINE
WITH A BAGPIPE?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.337
- NO, THAT'S QUAV--AAH!

14:40.421 --> 14:42.840
SO, BAD NEWS.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.969
YOUR PRESIDENT
IS APPARENTLY, UM, DOOMED.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.305
WHICH I SUPPOSE MEANS
YOU'LL BE IN THE MARKET

14:49.388 --> 14:50.472
FOR A NEW WORLD LEADER.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.807
- NEGATORY!

14:51.890 --> 14:54.476
THE PRESIDENT
WILL BE RESCUED.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.478
ALL I NEED ARE--
- MONSTERS.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.732
[strained groans]

14:59.815 --> 15:02.568
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.904
- AND ME!
MONSTER ON THE, UH, INSIDE.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.490
- BOB, SHOW THEM WHY
YOU'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.241
- INDESTRUCT-O-BALL.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.703
GOOD IDEA!

15:17.916 --> 15:19.960
- MY TURN.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.631
HOP IN.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.758
- [whistles]

15:27.468 --> 15:29.887
- THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.305
THEY COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE!
- [screams]

15:31.388 --> 15:32.890
- THEN YOU BETTER GET IN THERE
AND SHOW 'EM WHAT FOR.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.975
- OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.102
MY PEOPLE DO NOT
"GET IN THERE."

15:37.186 --> 15:40.898
WE STAND ON THE SIDELINES
AND MAKE SCATHING QUIPS.

15:40.981 --> 15:41.899
- GET IN THERE!

15:41.982 --> 15:43.025
- [groans]

15:44.860 --> 15:48.030
- HEY, LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO JOIN US.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.116
- IT'S YOUR SHIP.
FEEL FREE TO LEAD THE WAY.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.243
- I'M HERE STRICTLY
IN AN ADVISORY ROLE.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.330
NOW, THE FIRST WAVE
OF DEFENSE WILL BE--

15:56.413 --> 15:59.833
- AGH!

15:59.917 --> 16:02.670
- YES, THOSE.
[hydraulics hiss]

16:02.753 --> 16:06.423
- HEY!
- THIS IS FUN!

16:06.507 --> 16:07.508
WHEE!

16:07.591 --> 16:09.802
- WHOA!
OOH!

16:09.885 --> 16:10.969
[laughs]

16:11.053 --> 16:12.346
THE ALIEN TECHNOLOGY
FAILED TO ANTICIPATE--

16:12.429 --> 16:14.807
[groans]

16:14.890 --> 16:16.892
MY COCKROACH ABILITY--
[grunts]

16:16.975 --> 16:17.726
TO WITHSTAND--
[grunts]

16:17.810 --> 16:20.938
THE WORST OF--
[grunts]

16:21.021 --> 16:24.274
[screams]

16:24.358 --> 16:27.111
GOING--GOING--
GOING GREAT IN THERE.

16:27.194 --> 16:31.115
GOING--LOTSA LAUGHS.
GOING GOOD.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.160
- [grunts]

16:37.121 --> 16:39.164
FOLLOW ME.
- NOW CAREFUL.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.918
THE NEXT CHAMBER WILL PROVE
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.545
- DIFFICULT FOR YOU,
FUNKY FEET,

16:44.628 --> 16:46.380
BUT LINK'S ON THIS
LIKE BUTTER ON BREAD.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.424
UGH!

16:48.507 --> 16:51.760
- THAT'S AN IMMOBILIZER RAY.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.887
- YEAH, THANKS.
I GET THAT NOW.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.348
[yelps]

16:56.432 --> 16:57.641
- [groans]
- SORRY.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.476
IMMOBILIZER RAY.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.645
- [groans]

17:01.729 --> 17:03.731
[all scream]

17:03.814 --> 17:04.897
- IT'S HOPELESS.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.025
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE PRESIDENT.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.234
OH.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.113
SO WHAT SAY
WE GIVE UP, HMM?

17:11.195 --> 17:14.782
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN DYING TO TRY
A SPECIAL EARTH BEVERAGE.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.037
UH, "LEEMONADE"
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED.

17:18.119 --> 17:18.704
IS IT GOOD?
HMM?

17:18.787 --> 17:21.540
- SUSAN, I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.790
AT LEAST,
I THINK IT'S AN IDEA.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.335
- GIVE IT TO ME, BOB.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.128
THE IDEA?

17:27.212 --> 17:28.422
- OH, RIGHT!

17:28.505 --> 17:31.383
LET THE RAY HIT ME
AND THEN USE ME AS A SHIELD.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.469
- BOB, THAT'S BRILLIANT.

17:33.552 --> 17:37.347
- OKAY, GET READY TO ROLL.
- READY!

17:37.431 --> 17:40.642
- [laughs]
THAT TICKLES.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.811
- THANKS, BOB.
- NO PROBLEM.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.480
YEP, FEELING
PRETTY IMMOBILE NOW.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.982
WHOA!

17:47.066 --> 17:48.400
- [sighs]

17:48.484 --> 17:49.568
[both groan]

17:49.651 --> 17:51.403
- HEY, GUYS,
YOU'RE HERE TOO!

17:51.487 --> 17:53.697
- [groans]

17:53.781 --> 17:55.282
- THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD BE BEHIND--

17:55.365 --> 17:56.450
- THIS DOOR.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.660
- [gasps]

17:58.744 --> 18:01.205
HEY, THAT'S LIKE
THE THING THAT ZAPPED ME!

18:01.288 --> 18:04.458
- OH, LET'S NOT
WASTE OUR TIME BICKERING.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.002
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT
TO SAVE!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.546
SEE, THERE HE IS.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.507
- COVERTON,
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.135
AND YOU TOO...
UH, I WANNA SAY SARAH?

18:15.219 --> 18:17.805
- SUSAN.
- DON'T STEP ON THE FLOOR!

18:17.888 --> 18:19.014
IT'S PRESSURE SENSITIVE.

18:19.097 --> 18:23.185
THAT IS VIRTUALLY
UNBREAKABLE.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.438
- MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR
APPROVAL RATING IS DROPPING.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.023
- [high-pitched shriek]

18:28.106 --> 18:29.525
[glass cracks]

18:29.608 --> 18:32.194
OH, CLEVER.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.862
WELL PLAYED, SARAH.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.781
- [annoyed]
YES, SIR.

18:35.864 --> 18:36.657
- CAREFULLY,
MR. PRESIDENT.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.535
CLIMB ONTO MY LAP.

18:39.618 --> 18:44.540
- [grunting]

18:44.623 --> 18:47.167
WHOA!

18:47.251 --> 18:49.628
- AAH!

18:49.711 --> 18:51.380
OH, KRALNAZ.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.548
- TELL ME,
ON YOUR PLANET,

18:52.631 --> 18:54.633
"OH, KRALNAZ"
MEANS SOMETHING GOOD.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.009
- NO.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.928
IT MEANS THE SHIP
IS LEAKING HYPERION,

18:58.011 --> 19:00.848
AND WHEN IT BLOWS,
IT WILL DESTROY HALF THE WORLD.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.766
- OH, KRALNAZ.
- HOLD ON.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.144
WHICH HALF OF THE WORLD,
HUH?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.562
[glass shatters]

19:06.645 --> 19:09.857
[hissing]

19:09.940 --> 19:11.692
[explosion]

19:11.775 --> 19:13.944
- DUCK AND COVER!

19:14.027 --> 19:18.699
[massive explosion]

19:18.782 --> 19:20.409
- WHOO!

19:20.492 --> 19:21.785
THAT WAS AWESOME.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.413
DID YOU SEE THAT, SUSAN?

19:24.496 --> 19:25.122
SUSAN?

19:25.205 --> 19:27.249
HEY, WHERE'S SUSAN?

19:27.332 --> 19:32.129
- I'M AFRAID
THAT SUSAN IS...GONE.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.255
- REALLY?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.256
I HOPE SHE WENT
SOMEPLACE NICE.

19:34.339 --> 19:38.135

BUDDY.

MONSTERS SAVE THE WORLD.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.272
- PLEASE, HALF THE WORLD.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.526
- FASCINATING.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.571
APPARENTLY, THE QUANTONIUM
LEFT IN GINORMICA'S SYSTEM

19:57.654 --> 19:59.948
ABSORBED THE EXPLOSIVE
HYPERION ENERGY

20:00.032 --> 20:01.867
AND REACTIVATED
HER POWERS.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.118
AND IT DID MORE THAN THAT.

20:03.201 --> 20:06.496
SUSAN,
THINK SMALL THOUGHTS.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.081
- SMALL THOUGHTS? OKAY.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.625
SNOWFLAKES, LADYBUGS,

20:14.755 --> 20:16.840
- CHECK ME OUT.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.051
I CAN TOTALLY CONTROL
MY GINORMA-SIZING.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.469
- ALL RIGHT, SUSAN.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.181
THAT'S REALLY--
AAH!

20:24.264 --> 20:25.223
- SORRY, BOB.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.101
OKAY, MAYBE NOT
TOTALLY TOTALLY CONTROL.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.645
- NO PROBLEM!

20:29.728 --> 20:34.149
- MONSTERS, FOR YOUR PERFORMANCE
IN SAVING ME AND THE WORLD,

20:34.232 --> 20:35.484
BUT MOSTLY ME,

20:35.567 --> 20:36.985
I'M OFFICIALLY

20:42.407 --> 20:42.991
NO, WAIT.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.161
YAY!

20:46.244 --> 20:47.871
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT
HAVING YOU WORK

20:47.955 --> 20:51.500
ALONGSIDE MY NEW BFF,
COVERTON.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.835
- WHAT?
AN ALIEN IS STAYING HERE?

20:53.919 --> 20:54.836
- I KNOW.
I'M SO JEALOUS.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.338
- OH, MR. PRESIDENT.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.091
WERE I TO GO
TO WASHINGTON WITH YOU,

20:59.174 --> 21:04.346
WE'D JUST WASTE ALL OUR TIME
GIGGLING AND GOSSIPING.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.597

21:05.681 --> 21:07.224

I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

21:16.274 --> 21:17.109
[joints crack]

21:17.192 --> 21:20.237
- UNFORTUNATELY,
MY COVERLORD,

21:20.320 --> 21:23.407
OUR PLAN TO NEUTRALIZE
GINORMICA FAILED.

21:23.490 --> 21:27.369
BUT I HAVE THE FULL TRUST
OF THE PRESIDENT.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.871
AND EVEN BETTER,
I HAVE BEEN PLACED

21:29.955 --> 21:32.416
IN THE EARTHLINGS'
MOST SECRET BASE.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.084
[knocking]

21:34.167 --> 21:35.377
- HURRY UP IN THERE!

21:35.460 --> 21:37.170
MOTHER NATURE'S CALLING ME
WITH A BULLHORN!

21:37.254 --> 21:38.880

SORRY, YOUR EARTH COMMODES
ARE SO CONFUSING.
