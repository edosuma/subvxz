00:00.073 --> 00:04.192
Attention Cloud 9
shoppers and employees.

00:04.194 --> 00:06.695
I, uh... I just wanted
to take this moment

00:06.697 --> 00:08.530
to, uh...

00:09.967 --> 00:13.764
Uh, to... to say goodbye.

00:14.772 --> 00:17.232
This is my last day as manager here.

00:17.233 --> 00:20.761
I am stepping down to spend
more time with my family.

00:21.245 --> 00:22.477
Pretty emotional for a guy

00:22.479 --> 00:24.646
who only demoted himself
to floor worker.

00:24.648 --> 00:26.348
Yeah, you'd think
he'd mention that part.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.528
No, he's getting to it.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.751
He's been doing the
same speech every hour.

00:29.753 --> 00:32.119
He wants to cover
as many customers as possible.

00:32.122 --> 00:33.522
I've heard it five times.

00:33.524 --> 00:34.623
He's getting really good at it.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.692
My second family.

00:36.694 --> 00:39.544
While you've been helping
people find light bulbs

00:39.546 --> 00:41.044
and paper towels,

00:41.665 --> 00:45.094
you've also been
helping me find myself.

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

00:50.607 --> 00:52.641
And guys, I say this a lot,

00:52.643 --> 00:55.491
but we really need to wet down
those raccoon droppings

00:55.519 --> 00:56.813
before we sweep.

00:56.814 --> 00:58.102
Dry sweeping is the reason

00:58.103 --> 01:00.390
why those roundworm eggs go airborne.

01:01.563 --> 01:04.052
God, I just realized
this is the last time

01:04.054 --> 01:06.955
I'm going to tell you guys
to spray your droppings.

01:06.957 --> 01:08.423
- Aww.
- And I finally get to stop

01:08.425 --> 01:10.492
sucking up to this guy. Right?

01:10.494 --> 01:11.576
That's what you've been doing?

01:11.578 --> 01:12.444
- Yeah.
- So now

01:12.446 --> 01:14.396
that you're becoming a floor worker,

01:14.398 --> 01:15.397
what do we call you?

01:15.399 --> 01:16.398
Glenn's fine.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.499
- Glenn?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.501 --> 01:18.383
Feels weird.

01:18.385 --> 01:20.368
Does this mean Dina's gonna be manager?

01:20.370 --> 01:21.603
No, thank you.

01:21.605 --> 01:23.113
Though I will outrank Glenn,

01:23.114 --> 01:25.540
who will be right below Marcus
and just above Jonah.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.059
You rank us?

01:27.061 --> 01:28.253
And I'm below Marcus?

01:28.254 --> 01:30.045
That's crazy. I'm the worst.

01:30.047 --> 01:31.346
It's that kind of self-awareness

01:31.348 --> 01:32.577
that keeps you a notch above Jonah.

01:32.578 --> 01:35.517
- So who's taking over?
- Well, I'm hoping it's Amy.

01:36.987 --> 01:38.487
- What?
- Cool!

01:38.489 --> 01:39.604
I mean, I doubt it.

01:39.605 --> 01:41.423
I have to get Laurie to interview me,

01:41.425 --> 01:42.581
and she hates me.

01:42.582 --> 01:44.159
Oh, I'm sure she doesn't hate you.

01:44.161 --> 01:46.361
Eh, she's made some comments.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:57.975 --> 01:59.571
Oh, here he does. Here he goes.

01:59.572 --> 02:01.288
<i>Okay, chowder's headed down south.</i>

02:02.012 --> 02:04.379
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
- Eww!

02:08.118 --> 02:10.852
- Oh, God! I hate this!
- Excuse me.

02:10.854 --> 02:12.120
One second. It's almost done.

02:12.122 --> 02:13.722
Oh, I think it's done now.

02:13.724 --> 02:15.357
Oh, hey. Hi, Laurie.

02:15.359 --> 02:16.925
It's, uh... uh, been a minute.

02:16.927 --> 02:19.995
Um, is your hair the same?

02:19.997 --> 02:20.669
Yes.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.898
Sorry, we were just watching HotNuts.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.289
What's HotNuts?

02:24.290 --> 02:27.202
YouTube guy pours
hot liquids on his genitals.

02:27.204 --> 02:28.470
Beverages, soups.

02:28.472 --> 02:29.892
Hmm, sounds brilliant.

02:29.893 --> 02:32.107
So where should our phones be
during work hours?

02:32.109 --> 02:35.143
- Um, in our pockets.
- In your lockers.

02:35.145 --> 02:37.212
In our lockers, right. Yeah.

02:38.932 --> 02:41.316
So why don't you go do that now, okay?

02:41.735 --> 02:43.418
Nice to see you guys.

02:44.087 --> 02:45.237
Man, I really wanted to show you

02:45.239 --> 02:46.988
the Thanksgiving one he did.

02:46.989 --> 02:49.141
Ah, does he pour hot
gravy down his pants?

02:49.143 --> 02:50.725
Yeah, but he does it with his dad.

02:50.727 --> 02:52.060
It's really nice.

02:54.631 --> 02:57.699
Gosh, you know, everything
in here has a story,

02:57.701 --> 02:59.922
like this hole punch.

02:59.923 --> 03:02.537
Okay, it's only supposed
to be able to do 18 pages,

03:02.539 --> 03:05.207
but one day, I got it to do 25.

03:05.209 --> 03:06.825
I went straight home

03:06.827 --> 03:08.710
and made love to Jerusha that day.

03:08.712 --> 03:10.228
Well, that's a story I'll remember.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.437
Oh yeah. You like it?

03:13.016 --> 03:14.132
You should have it.

03:14.134 --> 03:15.617
Oh, uh, no, I... I...

03:15.619 --> 03:17.786
Oh no, come on, please.
You love it. Take it.

03:17.788 --> 03:19.654
Um, if he gets a hole punch,

03:19.656 --> 03:21.223
can I get this bag full of cash?

03:21.225 --> 03:23.658
- Whoa!
- Oh, that's my rainy day fund.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.888
Corporate sets aside
a certain amount of the budget

03:25.889 --> 03:27.156
for miscellaneous maintenance,

03:27.157 --> 03:28.413
so whenever we don't use it,

03:28.415 --> 03:30.352
I just take out in cash
and set it aside.

03:30.353 --> 03:31.633
You know, just in case.

03:31.635 --> 03:33.847
But they think you spent
this on maintenance.

03:33.848 --> 03:36.671
Yeah, and I would have
if I needed to, but I didn't.

03:36.673 --> 03:38.573
So just leave it there
for the next manager.

03:38.575 --> 03:40.775
Wait, so... so you told them

03:40.777 --> 03:42.110
you spent money you didn't spend.

03:42.112 --> 03:43.412
- Mm-hmm.
- Then you...

03:43.413 --> 03:45.113
took the money and kept it in a bag

03:45.115 --> 03:46.681
hidden in your office.

03:46.683 --> 03:50.001
- Yeah.
- Isn't that embezzlement?

03:50.003 --> 03:52.988
No, embezzlement is when you put jewels

03:52.990 --> 03:54.210
on your jacket.

03:54.211 --> 03:55.824
I think you mean bedazzling.

03:55.826 --> 03:57.217
Which is also a crime.

04:01.131 --> 04:04.032
Oh, hey! Laurie! What's up, girl?

04:04.034 --> 04:06.055
It's been, like, forever.

04:06.056 --> 04:08.603
How's the district manager world?

04:08.605 --> 04:10.672
#DMLife, right?

04:10.674 --> 04:13.270
Uh, I'm still doing
some physical therapy

04:13.271 --> 04:15.374
from when you ran me over
with the golf cart.

04:15.746 --> 04:17.315
Yup, yeah.

04:17.748 --> 04:21.048
Um, well, anyway, since
Glenn is stepping down,

04:21.051 --> 04:23.919
I was wondering if, maybe,
I could interview for the job.

04:24.397 --> 04:25.570
You want to be manager?

04:25.572 --> 04:28.690
Yeah, um, well,
I've been here for 15 years,

04:28.692 --> 04:31.526
and I did really well
in the Cloud 9 Academy.

04:31.528 --> 04:33.046
Oh, wow. Okay.

04:33.047 --> 04:34.729
You did the one day,
uh, training session

04:34.731 --> 04:35.605
near the airport?

04:36.366 --> 04:38.199
I'm not sure what it
being near an airport

04:38.201 --> 04:39.042
has to do with anything.

04:39.043 --> 04:40.268
I'm sorry. I would really love

04:40.269 --> 04:42.236
to interview you, but I actually have

04:42.239 --> 04:43.838
another candidate in mind, so...

04:43.840 --> 04:46.241
- Oh. Okay. Great.
- Yeah.

04:46.243 --> 04:48.326
Well, um, if that guy falls through

04:48.328 --> 04:50.312
or, you know, if
anything else opens up,

04:50.314 --> 04:52.714
I... I would love to throw
my hat in the ring.

04:52.716 --> 04:53.808
Shwoop!

04:54.434 --> 04:56.301
Sorry, I just touched your boob.

05:01.525 --> 05:03.358
Hey guys, you won't be hearing from me

05:03.360 --> 05:04.759
for the next five hours,

05:04.761 --> 05:06.661
but don't worry,
I haven't been kidnapped.

05:06.663 --> 05:08.563
I just can't use my phone.

05:08.565 --> 05:10.598
But if you don't hear
from me after that,

05:10.600 --> 05:14.069
I probably have been kidnapped,
and it was probably my uncle.

05:14.071 --> 05:16.771
He's really nice,
but just statistically...

05:18.375 --> 05:19.140
Stay strong.

05:19.142 --> 05:20.508
You'll be out before you know it.

05:24.581 --> 05:26.564
Oh, shoot. I forgot my phone.

05:26.566 --> 05:27.814
Cheyenne.

05:29.486 --> 05:30.853
Oh, yeah.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.191
Glenn, it's... it's going to be okay.

05:36.193 --> 05:38.276
Just... just breathe
and drink your juice.

05:40.437 --> 05:42.618
Well, not at the same time, obviously.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.083
Maybe they won't
even realize it's gone.

05:45.085 --> 05:47.435
They do an audit every time
there's a management change

05:47.437 --> 05:49.404
at the store. I think
they're going to notice

05:49.406 --> 05:51.639
$27,000 missing.

05:51.641 --> 05:52.640
You can't just return it?

05:52.642 --> 05:54.976
No, 'cause I already
told them that I spent it.

05:54.978 --> 05:56.378
Okay, maybe this helps.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.501
I found this jacket online.

05:57.502 --> 05:59.845
It's beaded, it's exactly $27,000.

05:59.846 --> 06:01.282
So add to cart?

06:01.283 --> 06:02.838
Spending it isn't going to help.

06:02.839 --> 06:04.131
Actually, it might.

06:04.132 --> 06:05.154
- What?
- Yes!

06:05.922 --> 06:07.959
Glenn, can I borrow
$2,000 for sales tax?

06:08.425 --> 06:10.049
- Sure.
- No, not on the coat...

06:10.050 --> 06:12.994
that's bananas... but if you need
to spend it on maintenance,

06:12.996 --> 06:14.929
why don't we just spend it
on maintenance?

06:14.931 --> 06:18.333
How am I supposed to find
$27,000 worth of stuff

06:18.335 --> 06:20.368
to repair in one day?

06:20.370 --> 06:22.837
There's just not
that much stuff that's broken!

06:22.839 --> 06:25.190
Well, there would be if we broke it.

06:26.843 --> 06:29.010
Ugh, I can't wait to have a manager

06:29.012 --> 06:31.079
that's not a paunchy
idiot with elf hair.

06:31.081 --> 06:32.914
Well, it's not gonna be me.

06:32.916 --> 06:34.582
Laurie won't even let me
interview for the job.

06:34.584 --> 06:37.235
She's already decided who she's hiring.

06:37.237 --> 06:39.320
Whoa. It sounds like you need to go

06:39.322 --> 06:41.527
take a big, fat 17-B on her desk.

06:41.892 --> 06:43.792
Eww. What are you talking about?

06:44.179 --> 06:46.528
Rule 17-B. 17-B?

06:46.530 --> 06:48.763
Come on, you know 17-B. 17-B.

06:48.765 --> 06:50.410
B as in boy. Rule 17-B.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.664
You can't just keep saying it...

06:51.665 --> 06:54.002
Any employee who completes
the Cloud 9 Academy

06:54.004 --> 06:56.347
should be granted an interview if...

06:57.274 --> 07:00.909
if a management position
becomes available at their...

07:00.911 --> 07:02.977
- Dina, just say it.
- At their store.

07:03.543 --> 07:04.295
Okay?

07:04.297 --> 07:05.947
She literally has to let you interview.

07:05.949 --> 07:07.315
She's already decided who she's hiring,

07:07.317 --> 07:08.316
so what's the point?

07:08.318 --> 07:10.529
The point is you should get
to make your case.

07:11.138 --> 07:13.219
Look, if you feel awkward asking her,

07:13.220 --> 07:14.976
I'm happy to come back you up.

07:16.626 --> 07:19.077
Laurie Neustadt, you are
in violation of rule 17-B

07:19.079 --> 07:20.542
of Cloud 9 hiring policy.

07:20.543 --> 07:21.963
So you either interview Amy,

07:21.965 --> 07:24.132
or I file a 31-J with Kyle Robichot,

07:24.134 --> 07:26.968
and you do not want me filing
a 31-J with Kyle Robichot.

07:26.970 --> 07:28.136
So that's your move?

07:28.138 --> 07:29.788
You're forcing me to interview you.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.206
- I... I... I...
- Fine.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.224
Whatever, let's just
get this over with.

07:35.178 --> 07:36.409
Knock 'em dead.

07:43.642 --> 07:46.560
So, should I start with
my qualifications?

07:46.562 --> 07:48.479
So I don't really think
that you are qualified,

07:48.481 --> 07:51.148
but, you know,
it is your interview, so...

07:52.888 --> 07:55.736
Okay, all right, um, well,

07:56.199 --> 07:59.990
I've been at Cloud 9 for 15 years.

07:59.992 --> 08:05.079
I have strong relationships
with the staff, and over time,

08:05.081 --> 08:09.333
we have really built
a mutual respect and trust.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.419
Um, sorry, do you need a minute?

08:12.421 --> 08:14.288
No, I'm fine. No. Keep going.

08:16.092 --> 08:19.093
Okay, uh, well,
as far as specifics go...

08:19.095 --> 08:19.960
Yo, yo, yo, it's HotNuts here.

08:19.962 --> 08:22.129
I've undertaken a
number of initiatives.

08:22.131 --> 08:23.264
Uh, for starters,

08:23.266 --> 08:25.466
I streamlined our go-backs process

08:25.468 --> 08:28.602
so that we waste less time in restock,

08:29.029 --> 08:32.306
and also I reorganized
the women's wear section

08:32.308 --> 08:36.143
so that basics like camisoles
and strapless bras

08:36.145 --> 08:38.145
were easier to find
during wedding season.

08:38.147 --> 08:39.905
<i>Oh, God! They look really bad!</i>

08:40.006 --> 08:41.527
I'm not getting this job, am I?

08:41.873 --> 08:42.650
No.

08:46.622 --> 08:49.623
Um, are you scrolling
a block of cheese?

08:49.625 --> 08:53.327
Ugh, I miss my phone!

08:53.329 --> 08:54.995
Yeah, I know. Look, it's only

08:54.997 --> 08:56.714
a couple more hours.
It's the length of a movie.

08:56.716 --> 08:58.499
If I can sit through
"The Hitman's Bodyguard,"

08:58.501 --> 09:00.134
I can make it through this.

09:00.136 --> 09:02.636
- "The Hitman's Bodyguard"?
- Yeah.

09:03.226 --> 09:04.582
You didn't see that? Ryan Reynolds,

09:04.609 --> 09:06.340
Samuel I. Jackson, and uh,

09:06.721 --> 09:09.727
the other guy. He always
plays a bad dude.

09:10.413 --> 09:11.611
Uh, he's British.

09:11.612 --> 09:13.188
- David Beckham.
- No.

09:13.391 --> 09:14.383
He's British,.

09:14.384 --> 09:16.834
Yeah, I know, but that's not who I'm...

09:17.627 --> 09:18.709
it's, uh... oh!

09:18.710 --> 09:20.760
Okay, you know who I'm talking about.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.930
He's in everything.

09:21.931 --> 09:23.422
He was in Harry Potter.

09:23.423 --> 09:25.511
- Oh, Daniel Radcliffe!
- No.

09:26.053 --> 09:28.483
- Daniel Radcliffe is British.
- Yeah, I know. Okay?

09:29.215 --> 09:31.583
All right, I got a real grab bag!

09:32.103 --> 09:34.646
I've got hammers and
wrenches, crowbars.

09:34.647 --> 09:36.228
What do we need a bow and arrow for?

09:36.229 --> 09:38.438
I don't know. It felt... of the world.

09:38.439 --> 09:40.833
Okay, well, where... where...
where do we begin?

09:41.530 --> 09:42.840
I figure we'd knock

09:42.841 --> 09:44.068
a few holes through this wall here.

09:44.069 --> 09:46.295
What, no! This... this wall?

09:46.296 --> 09:49.435
This... this is the wall
that Cody pinned me against

09:49.436 --> 09:51.583
when he was learning
to drive the forklift.

09:51.584 --> 09:52.806
- Glenn, Glenn.
- Come on!

09:52.807 --> 09:53.829
If you don't want to go to jail,

09:53.830 --> 09:55.409
we're gonna have to do some damage.

09:55.410 --> 09:56.183
Yeah.

09:57.793 --> 09:59.651
- All right.
- Go get 'em.

10:03.292 --> 10:05.076
I... I think, uh, I think you wanna...

10:05.077 --> 10:07.105
you wanna put your back into it
a little more.

10:07.887 --> 10:08.919
There you go.

10:08.921 --> 10:09.823
- Ow!
- Oh, oh.

10:09.824 --> 10:12.532
So apparently, I'm just not
qualified enough for the job.

10:12.852 --> 10:14.909
You're more qualified
than Glenn ever was.

10:15.428 --> 10:16.916
Do you want me to seduce her for you?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.863
No. Thank you, though.

10:18.864 --> 10:20.817
Have you ever heard of
something called HotNuts?

10:20.818 --> 10:21.975
Oh yeah, that guy's great.

10:21.976 --> 10:23.659
He's worth, like, 10 million dollars.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.008
Excuse me, folks,
can everyone gather up?

10:26.842 --> 10:29.717
Um, I'd like to introduce
you all to someone.

10:29.718 --> 10:32.397
This is, uh, Blaine Neustadt,

10:32.398 --> 10:33.993
and he's going to be taking over

10:33.994 --> 10:35.673
for Glenn as manager.

10:35.674 --> 10:38.863
You... you... uh, excuse me, Neustadt?

10:38.864 --> 10:40.817
As in, like, your last name?

10:40.818 --> 10:42.286
Uh-huh. Yeah.

10:42.553 --> 10:44.743
Not that it's any
of your business, but yes,

10:44.744 --> 10:46.637
Glenn is my son,
but that has nothing to do

10:46.638 --> 10:47.971
with why he got hired here.

10:47.972 --> 10:50.686
Wow, you do not look old
enough to be her son.

10:51.043 --> 10:51.937
That's an odd thing to say.

10:51.938 --> 10:54.166
Ah, I just want to say hey everyone!

10:54.167 --> 10:56.600
Uh, I'm so excited to be here.

10:56.601 --> 10:59.154
This is so cool to be part
of this great team.

10:59.155 --> 11:02.520
Uh, mostly I am very excited
to be done doing Postmates.

11:02.521 --> 11:04.476
Oh, my car reeks.

11:05.318 --> 11:06.617
This is a good choice

11:06.618 --> 11:09.607
if you're looking for graphics
and raw processing power.

11:09.608 --> 11:12.826
Um, for example, I'll just
pull up my Instagram account.

11:12.827 --> 11:15.013
Oh, I'm just looking
for a "get well" gift

11:15.014 --> 11:16.045
for my mother-in-law.

11:16.046 --> 11:18.053
She doesn't use a computer.

11:18.054 --> 11:20.324
What? Corona and Stacy S.

11:20.326 --> 11:21.959
Are hanging out at Chili's?

11:21.961 --> 11:23.341
I hate them!

11:23.996 --> 11:24.712
Like.

11:24.832 --> 11:27.164
Okay, so I heard that
if you look directly

11:27.166 --> 11:29.326
into the scanner light,
you instantly go blind.

11:30.019 --> 11:31.841
This weirdly makes me feel better,

11:31.842 --> 11:34.109
'cause it wasn't about me
being unqualified.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.815
She just wanted to hire her son.

11:35.816 --> 11:37.455
Yeah, but you can't let her do that.

11:37.456 --> 11:39.194
You need to go back
up to her and tell her

11:39.195 --> 11:41.353
that she needs to either give
you a real shot at this job,

11:41.354 --> 11:42.540
or you'll go to corporate and tell them

11:42.553 --> 11:43.932
about her little nepotism hire.

11:43.933 --> 11:46.411
No, I'm not gonna go
tell on her like I'm 12.

11:46.412 --> 11:47.792
Besides, corporate doesn't care.

11:47.793 --> 11:49.307
It would be a waste of my time.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.600
Hey, um, you're
the floor supervisor, right?

11:51.601 --> 11:52.321
Uh-huh.

11:52.322 --> 11:53.764
Great, awesome, um.

11:53.765 --> 11:55.868
Can you tell me where inventory is?

11:57.329 --> 12:01.207
Uh, yeah, it's sort of all around us.

12:02.909 --> 12:05.471
Yes, yes, thank you.

12:05.472 --> 12:08.072
I will... I will go look
into that. Thank you.

12:13.289 --> 12:14.545
- Can we talk?
- No!

12:14.547 --> 12:15.215
Oh, God.

12:15.216 --> 12:16.411
I'm sorry. You're busy.

12:16.412 --> 12:18.258
- Get out! Go!
- Never mind.

12:24.037 --> 12:28.007
Amy! The Aiming of the Shrew.

12:28.009 --> 12:29.425
Hey, Laurie.

12:29.427 --> 12:31.210
I have been meaning to talk to you.

12:31.212 --> 12:34.380
I want to make you a manager.

12:34.382 --> 12:35.848
Um, what?

12:35.850 --> 12:38.267
What, uh, me? What about Blaine?

12:39.053 --> 12:40.886
He... Blaine's great. Um, it's just...

12:40.888 --> 12:42.221
you know, I've been thinking about it,

12:42.223 --> 12:44.557
and I looked through your
file, and clearly,

12:44.559 --> 12:46.591
you're the most qualified
person here, so...

12:47.544 --> 12:49.028
Um, wow.

12:49.030 --> 12:52.231
That is a lot to take in
all of a sudden.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.867
Big, big opportunity.

12:54.869 --> 12:58.715
I know, um,
just before I say yes or no,

12:58.716 --> 13:00.072
I just want to be clear.

13:00.074 --> 13:02.074
Um, if you're offering it to me

13:02.076 --> 13:04.600
because I'm the best person
for the job, then yes!

13:04.601 --> 13:07.129
I will take and I will be kick-ass.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.433
But if you're offering it
to me because of...

13:11.752 --> 13:13.419
Then, uh, you know,
you don't have to do that.

13:13.421 --> 13:15.304
It's not like I'm going
to go tell anyone.

13:15.877 --> 13:17.423
Really? Wow.

13:17.874 --> 13:19.782
Okay. I appreciate that.

13:19.783 --> 13:21.427
Not too many people would do that.

13:21.429 --> 13:21.986
Thank you.

13:23.931 --> 13:25.264
Sorry, wait, I'm sorry.

13:25.266 --> 13:26.982
Uh, so where did we land exactly?

13:26.984 --> 13:29.435
- What do you mean?
- Do I have the job?

13:29.437 --> 13:31.403
But I thought you just turned it down.

13:31.405 --> 13:33.238
Well, no, I mean, that just...

13:33.240 --> 13:34.239
only if you were offering it to me

13:34.241 --> 13:35.074
because of the drug thing,

13:35.076 --> 13:37.109
but if you were offering it to me

13:37.111 --> 13:38.277
because of my abilities,

13:38.279 --> 13:39.171
then...

13:40.281 --> 13:41.400
Hmm.

13:41.999 --> 13:43.776
So this is awkward.

14:26.961 --> 14:28.961
Go, go, go.

14:39.775 --> 14:41.006
Okay, no. You know this guy.

14:41.008 --> 14:43.152
He's a British actor, he's older,

14:43.154 --> 14:44.143
he likes being weird,

14:44.145 --> 14:45.511
he's always doing stuff with his hair.

14:45.513 --> 14:47.179
Sometimes it's long,
sometimes it's short.

14:47.608 --> 14:49.481
He was in Batman.
Oh, uh, Christian Bale.

14:49.483 --> 14:51.517
No, no, no. He wasn't Batman.

14:51.519 --> 14:53.185
Like I said, he's older.

14:53.187 --> 14:55.154
Just... just look it up on your phone.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.264
Michael Caine.

14:56.265 --> 14:58.739
No, it's not Michael...
just pull up IMDB!

14:58.740 --> 15:00.986
Dude, it's Michael Caine!
He plays the butler.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.157
Yeah, I know he plays the butler.

15:02.158 --> 15:03.988
- The Joker?
- Yeah,

15:03.990 --> 15:07.875
the older British actor
I'm thinking of is the Joker.

15:07.877 --> 15:08.765
Thank you.

15:09.238 --> 15:10.273
I like movies.

15:11.448 --> 15:13.254
And then she just offered me the job.

15:13.255 --> 15:15.357
This is awesome! You and me,

15:15.358 --> 15:16.717
manager, assistant manager?

15:16.719 --> 15:18.836
Oh, it's going to be like
we're Bush and Cheney.

15:18.838 --> 15:20.721
You know, I'm the brains
pulling all the strings

15:20.723 --> 15:22.673
behind the scenes, and you're
the super sexy puppet.

15:22.675 --> 15:25.009
What... I'm... I'm...
I didn't take the job.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.133
What? Why?

15:26.134 --> 15:28.679
Because that's not how
I wanna get the job.

15:28.681 --> 15:30.564
If they're going to hire me,
I want it to be because

15:30.566 --> 15:32.016
I'm the most qualified person.

15:33.686 --> 15:37.313
Hey, so I guess we're
just out of green beans.

15:37.314 --> 15:40.524
Should I get somebody to go
buy more from another Cloud 9?

15:41.911 --> 15:43.840
Is that really
what you think you should do?

15:44.523 --> 15:46.239
I guess. Right?

15:47.083 --> 15:48.866
I just hope they're not selling
them for more than we are,

15:48.868 --> 15:50.701
or else we're losing money on this.

15:51.671 --> 15:52.920
Okay.

15:54.590 --> 15:56.565
There is a lot of damage around here.

15:56.566 --> 15:57.728
Yeah, I know.

15:57.729 --> 15:59.710
It was a gang of teenaged hoodlums.

15:59.712 --> 16:01.929
You know, slicked hair,
leather jackets,

16:01.931 --> 16:03.714
combs in their back pockets.

16:03.716 --> 16:06.805
Uh, total, I'd say you're
looking at $18,000 for repairs.

16:06.806 --> 16:07.624
$18,000?

16:07.625 --> 16:09.185
Yeah, there's a lot to do around here.

16:09.186 --> 16:11.322
I thought it would be
more like $27,000.

16:11.891 --> 16:13.695
You never charge me this little.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.441
The truth is...

16:16.062 --> 16:17.945
I've been overbilling you for years,

16:17.947 --> 16:20.551
but I recently quit drinking

16:20.552 --> 16:22.900
and I'm trying to be a better person.

16:22.902 --> 16:25.736
I can do it for $15,000,
but that's final.

16:25.738 --> 16:27.705
$15,000, but that's crazy!

16:27.707 --> 16:28.799
No, it's not crazy.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.546
It's... it's me trying to be
a better person.

16:30.547 --> 16:31.909
Can you go with me on this one?

16:31.911 --> 16:33.464
Yeah, okay.

16:42.362 --> 16:43.728
I'm just gonna say it.

16:43.809 --> 16:46.142
Blaine is sexy,
but he is not a good manager.

16:46.225 --> 16:47.475
He keeps pointing at me and goes,

16:47.476 --> 16:48.593
"This guy gets it,"

16:48.594 --> 16:50.427
and I don't. I don't get it.

16:50.429 --> 16:52.229
Well, none of us would have
to deal with Blaine

16:52.231 --> 16:54.898
if someone had taken the management job

16:54.900 --> 16:56.433
when Laurie offered it to her.

16:56.435 --> 16:58.101
- What?
- Uh, wait.

16:58.103 --> 16:59.252
She gave you the job?

16:59.253 --> 17:00.938
No. No.

17:02.274 --> 17:04.441
I mean, technically yes, she did,

17:04.443 --> 17:08.111
but only because I walked in on her
doing something embarrassing.

17:08.113 --> 17:10.280
Let's just say it involved
her nose and cocaine.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.281
What?

17:11.282 --> 17:12.415
Oh, my God!

17:12.417 --> 17:14.785
So you could've had the job,
but you turned it down?

17:15.153 --> 17:17.287
Guys, I'm not going to blackmail my way

17:17.289 --> 17:18.454
into being the manager.

17:18.457 --> 17:20.290
I should get it because I earned it.

17:20.291 --> 17:21.590
Right, just like Blaine earned it

17:21.593 --> 17:23.460
by coming out of the district manager.

17:23.462 --> 17:25.462
He was born into power
like Prince Charles.

17:25.464 --> 17:27.431
At least you're working for it
like Meghan Markle.

17:27.433 --> 17:30.300
Anyway, your blackmail
cancels out his nepotism.

17:30.302 --> 17:31.802
And it'd be a lot better for us.

17:31.804 --> 17:33.854
I mean I rather work for you
than a guy my own age.

17:33.856 --> 17:35.087
Oh, honey.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.974
You got to do what's
for the greater good.

17:36.976 --> 17:38.859
If you could cure cancer,

17:38.861 --> 17:40.861
but you had to blow up
a bus full of children,

17:41.392 --> 17:42.279
wouldn't you do it?

17:42.281 --> 17:44.481
I mean, I guess?

17:44.483 --> 17:46.014
Just take the job.

17:46.308 --> 17:47.317
You're not just doing it for you.

17:47.319 --> 17:49.035
You're doing it for all of us.

17:49.488 --> 17:51.455
I mean, I guess I would be
better than Blaine.

17:51.457 --> 17:53.791
- Yeah.
- Hey Amy, guess what?

17:54.209 --> 17:57.656
One of the kids
on that bus had the cure.

17:58.664 --> 17:59.830
Twist ending.

18:01.656 --> 18:03.773
Okay, well,
maybe prison won't be too bad.

18:03.775 --> 18:06.443
You know, maybe I can be
the guy that tells the warden

18:06.445 --> 18:08.245
that the other guys
are doing bad things

18:08.247 --> 18:09.927
and I'll just work my way up.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.960
Glenn, you're not going
to go to prison, okay?

18:12.147 --> 18:14.905
It's fine. We... we
just need to do about...

18:15.099 --> 18:16.898
what, 12 grand worth of damage

18:16.900 --> 18:18.505
- in... in the next hour.
- Oh.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.318
We have fertilizer
in the garden center.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.029
We can make a bomb.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.571
I feel like going from embezzlement

18:22.572 --> 18:24.527
to domestic terrorism
is the wrong direction.

18:24.528 --> 18:26.278
We could hire termites
to eat the store.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.530
- How do you hire termites?
- I don't know, with wood?

18:28.532 --> 18:30.865
Guys, no. No more.

18:33.337 --> 18:35.287
She's been through enough.

18:41.044 --> 18:42.794
Gary Oldman.

18:43.214 --> 18:44.379
Gary Oldman!

18:44.381 --> 18:46.431
Yes, it's Gary Oldman!

18:46.433 --> 18:47.915
Oh!

18:48.552 --> 18:49.934
I don't know who that is.

18:54.725 --> 18:58.248
Hey, Laur of the Rings.

18:58.942 --> 19:00.061
Hello, Amy.

19:00.545 --> 19:02.397
Um, I was thinking a little bit more

19:02.399 --> 19:04.532
about... about what you said before,

19:04.534 --> 19:07.068
uh, regarding, you know,
who is a better fit here.

19:07.070 --> 19:08.191
Oh, right.

19:08.192 --> 19:09.788
Yes, except I already told corporate

19:09.790 --> 19:11.365
that I gave the job to Blaine, so...

19:11.532 --> 19:13.644
Oh, okay.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.794
Uh, well, um...

19:16.100 --> 19:19.112
speaking of... of telling things
to corporate,

19:19.113 --> 19:20.548
just wanted to let you know that I...

19:20.550 --> 19:22.584
I haven't said anything to them yet

19:22.586 --> 19:24.419
about the, um...

19:25.922 --> 19:27.238
Cocaína.

19:28.518 --> 19:29.557
That's cocaine.

19:30.085 --> 19:30.774
Right.

19:31.395 --> 19:32.927
Um, thank you.

19:33.378 --> 19:35.597
Uh, you are a very good person.

19:36.841 --> 19:40.318
Well, I mean, am I?

19:42.559 --> 19:43.808
I don't know.

19:44.067 --> 19:46.884
I would just really hate
for corporate to ever find out,

19:47.577 --> 19:52.530
because that would be bad, Laurie-wise.

19:54.331 --> 19:55.450
Are you blackmailing me?

19:55.844 --> 19:58.168
No. No.

19:58.169 --> 20:01.089
God, no. No. Sorry.

20:01.091 --> 20:01.917
Okay.

20:04.711 --> 20:06.628
Okay, yes, I am blackmailing you!

20:06.630 --> 20:08.463
If you don't give me the job,
I will call corporate

20:08.465 --> 20:11.015
and tell them that you are
a huge [bleep] cokehead.

20:15.439 --> 20:17.806
Really? That's the picture you chose?

20:17.808 --> 20:19.391
I had to blow up the staff photo.

20:19.393 --> 20:20.725
I couldn't find any other photos of you

20:20.727 --> 20:22.527
other than the one
from Cheyenne's wedding,

20:22.529 --> 20:23.611
but with all the hair and makeup,

20:23.613 --> 20:25.029
it looked like you were trying
to be a supermodel.

20:25.536 --> 20:27.031
Yeah. Good call.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.232
I think it looks good,

20:29.369 --> 20:30.172
Boss.

20:33.657 --> 20:35.907
Well, I'm sorry we couldn't
get you all the way.

20:35.909 --> 20:37.709
Yeah, but you tried your best,

20:37.711 --> 20:39.377
and I really appreciate that.

20:39.379 --> 20:40.663
Are you gonna be okay?

20:40.664 --> 20:42.163
Yup, don't worry about me.

20:42.165 --> 20:44.132
Everything's gonna be just fine.

20:47.137 --> 20:49.087
I can't believe he's not freaking out.

20:49.089 --> 20:50.755
Yeah, well, I mean,

20:50.757 --> 20:52.390
once you finally decide
to tell the truth...

20:52.392 --> 20:53.258
wait, what's he...

20:53.260 --> 20:55.093
- Whoa, no, stop!
- No, no, no, no, no!

20:57.397 --> 20:58.680
Oh!

20:59.900 --> 21:01.219
Glenn!

21:01.985 --> 21:03.485
- Oh, my God, Glenn!
- Are you okay?

21:05.405 --> 21:07.021
That ought to cover it, right?

21:08.024 --> 21:10.692
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

21:10.694 --> 21:13.144
Yeah, I thought so.
