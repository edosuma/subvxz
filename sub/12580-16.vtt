00:33.333 --> 00:34.357
Yup.

00:34.734 --> 00:35.894
Yup.

00:36.836 --> 00:37.928
Mmm-hmm.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.472
Yup.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.073
Mmm-hmm.

00:45.078 --> 00:48.946
-All right, there's the man of the hour.
-Give it, give it, give it.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.449
Dang it, Bill.
You were supposed to buy the beer!

00:51.551 --> 00:54.850
I went to the Mega Lo Mart.
They were all out of Alamo.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.319
Did you look hard?

00:56.423 --> 01:01.019
If you guys think I'm so stupid that
I can't tell when a store is out of beer...

01:01.127 --> 01:04.584
you're welcome to go there
and see for yourself.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.822
They are out of Alamo.

01:07.934 --> 01:11.097
The whole state's out of Alamo.
I already told you that this morning.

01:11.204 --> 01:15.265
Well, if you had come back to the alley
with me like I had asked....

01:19.979 --> 01:21.071
[Beeping]

01:25.051 --> 01:27.576
I have a good mind
to put my fist through this thing.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.882
You probably forgot to put in the code.

01:29.989 --> 01:34.483
-Oh, right, the code. What is it again?
-Are you a full-time teacher?

01:34.594 --> 01:37.154
Well, today,
I'm a full-time Spanish teacher.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.730
So you're a sub.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.858
I'm sorry, they only trust full-timers
with the code.

01:41.968 --> 01:44.596
We've had problems with frivolous use.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.730
How many copies do you need?

01:48.608 --> 01:52.408
Twenty copies of the Spanish quiz,
and 100 of these.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.575
And that is?

01:55.348 --> 01:57.179
I'm selling a bike.

02:03.056 --> 02:07.356
""Hi Brau""? I can't drink this.
You know I only drink Alamo.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.328
And you know all the stores are out of it.
But nobody knows why.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.491
Hey, Mom, remember
that Alamo hotline we called...

02:14.601 --> 02:17.126
when I got the pop-top stuck
on my big toe?

02:17.237 --> 02:20.729
It should be easier to call this time
without you screaming in my ear.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.633

WOMAN: Hola, Alamo Beer,
PEGGY: Hola, Peggy Hill,

02:36.322 --> 02:39.587
Much gracias, señorita,
Ustedflatter me.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.483
Well, adiós,

02:41.661 --> 02:44.425
Great news, Hank.
I just hung up with Alamo.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.965
What'd they say?
What happened to all the beer?

02:47.066 --> 02:50.297
Right, the shortage. It didn't come up.

02:50.803 --> 02:54.830
But, they liked my Español so much,
they offered me a temp job...

02:54.941 --> 02:57.842
as a bilingual
customer-service representative.

02:57.944 --> 03:02.278
That's even better. You'll be on the inside
working in the same facility...

03:02.382 --> 03:05.840
as brewmaster
Conrad ""Skip"" Meinhoffer lV.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.284
You can ask him
what's going on with the beer.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.588
This is your V.A.P. card.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.253
It designates you as a Very Alamo Person.

03:16.362 --> 03:20.822
It gets you into all the restricted,
employee-only areas of Alamo.

03:27.607 --> 03:31.099
This will be your desk.
Welcome to the Alamo family.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.439
Well, it's a little early, but what the hell.

03:34.547 --> 03:38.574
No, Peggy.
This is your box of Ala-mementos.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.779
Alamo mug, Alamo hat, Alamo key chain...

03:41.888 --> 03:44.049
and a ""Don't Drink and Drive"" T-shirt.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.217
Are these items
available to the general public?

03:47.327 --> 03:49.955
-Nope.
-Then I will treasure them.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.330
[Groaning]

03:51.531 --> 03:53.658
DALE: Bill, you have to make a decision.

03:53.766 --> 03:57.099
We got Red Lager, Pale Ale,
Amber Nut, Honey Bee--

03:57.203 --> 04:00.001
I don't know.
I'm too old to learn all this stuff.

04:00.106 --> 04:03.906
Guys, guys, great news.
Peggy got a job at Alamo.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.501
She'll find out
what's going on with our beer.

04:06.646 --> 04:07.806
[Cheering]

04:08.448 --> 04:11.008
I'll tell you what's going on with our beer.

04:11.117 --> 04:14.518
They've sold it to the Japanese,
who will change the formula...

04:14.621 --> 04:16.521
and repackage it in square bottles...

04:16.623 --> 04:19.456
that will only fit cup-holders
in Japanese cars.

04:19.559 --> 04:23.893
-Changing the formula? I don't like change.
-Now, just calm down.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.660
The bond between a beer company
and its loyal drinkers is sacred.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.235
There's no way they'd tamper
with something that won...

04:30.336 --> 04:32.930
the Munich Beer Festival of 1849.

04:33.039 --> 04:36.031
Peggy will be home any minute,
and then we'll know.

04:41.147 --> 04:45.379
You know, Theresa, this Alamo mug
and Alamo hat and Alamo key chain...

04:45.485 --> 04:46.645
get me to thinking.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.620
What has happened to all the Alamo Beer?

04:49.722 --> 04:51.121
I'd be happy to tell you.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.091
But first I'm gonna need
your Jane Hancock on this.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.127
""Non-disclosure agreement.""

04:56.229 --> 04:58.493
Now that you're part of the Alamo family...

04:58.598 --> 05:01.931
you're going to be trusted
with some of the family secrets.

05:02.035 --> 05:06.301
We need to know
that those secrets will stay in the family.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.566
I have never had a problem
keeping a secret.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.701
Ask any of the gay teachers
I've worked with, which you couldn't...

05:11.811 --> 05:14.336
because I would not tell you
who they were.

05:16.215 --> 05:19.207
-So, what's the skinny?
-Well....

05:20.386 --> 05:21.546
[Car horn honking]

05:22.955 --> 05:25.788
Hey! All right!

05:25.892 --> 05:30.693
Come on, guys. Get away from the car.
Alamo employee coming through.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.958
Gentlemen, the mystery is solved.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.433
-What did you find out?
-Please, Peggy.

05:36.536 --> 05:40.836
-Unfortunately, that is all I can tell you.
-What? Why?

05:40.940 --> 05:45.502
As a new member of the Alamo family,
I signed a non-disclosure agreement...

05:45.611 --> 05:50.412
which means that while I am privy
to company secrets, I cannot reveal them.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.413
Don't worry. I'll get to the bottom of this.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.323
So, I was thinking...

05:58.524 --> 06:01.118
you want to go ahead
and tell me what's going on?

06:01.227 --> 06:02.854
You know I cannot.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.023
Sure you can.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.501
I am sorry, Hank.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.096
Alamo trusts me
not to tell you their secrets.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.700
Just as you trust me not to tell them
about your narrow urethra.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.541
And believe me,
I had the perfect opportunity.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.477
I'll get out the foot lotion.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.611
-Oh, stop begging.
-Come on.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.450
You have a temp job one day...

06:30.556 --> 06:33.184
and it's more important
than a 20-year marriage?

06:33.292 --> 06:36.728
What about no secrets, huh?
""Till death do us part""?

06:36.829 --> 06:39.696
Think about that, Peggy. Death.

06:39.832 --> 06:40.890
[Peggy sighs]

06:41.367 --> 06:44.200
Okay, but you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.602
-I promise, I promise.
-Seriously. You can't tell the guys.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.800
I could lose my job for telling just you.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.935
And I already have 23 cents
in my pension plan.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.170
[Sighing]

06:54.414 --> 06:56.382
They are not changing the formula.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.780
They are trying to sell more beer
in Mexico.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.911
So they sent all of last month's
production run down there.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.045
But not to worry.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.216
Alamo Beer will be back on the shelves
in five days.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.316
Oh, Peggy, that's great news.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.293
The guys and I can probably get
to Mexico--

07:10.396 --> 07:14.332
No, Hank! You can't tell the guys
and you can't go to Mexico!

07:14.467 --> 07:16.094
All right, fine.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.670
But you can't stop me
from dreaming about it.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.796
Do not tell me what I can and cannot do.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.306
Did she tell you, Hank?
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.105
I'll hold my breath if you don't tell me.

07:26.212 --> 07:27.372
[lnhaling]

07:28.314 --> 07:31.875
He'll pass out before he dies.
He always does.

07:31.984 --> 07:35.078
Sorry, guys. I promised Peggy
I wouldn't say anything.

07:35.221 --> 07:39.123
Who would have thought Hank
would put some flash-in-the-pan wife...

07:39.225 --> 07:41.318
before 30 years of friendship?

07:41.427 --> 07:43.395
Yeah, man.
You're talking about no secrets, man.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.464
This is just like when we were kids, man.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.261
Old skinned knees, you know,
first crushes, man.

07:48.367 --> 07:52.201
Lemonade stand, little old tree house,
and the....

07:52.338 --> 07:53.327
[Sighing]

07:53.439 --> 07:54.406
[Bill thudding]

07:54.507 --> 07:56.600
Man, if you can't trust no people
in this alley, man...

07:56.709 --> 07:59.269
I wouldn't want to be alive, man.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.846
You and your guilt trips, Boomhauer.

08:01.948 --> 08:05.145
But, I promised Peggy I wouldn't tell...

08:05.251 --> 08:07.811
so don't give me those basset-hound eyes.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.751
After every call...

08:12.859 --> 08:15.419
write down where they called from
and what the problem is.

08:15.528 --> 08:19.089
If there's ever a caller you can't handle,
just press this button.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.961
That will hang up on them.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.296
Hola, Alamo Beer, Qué es su problema?

08:27.006 --> 08:28.496
Vomitaido,

08:28.875 --> 08:30.342
Vomitaido?

08:39.418 --> 08:43.855
Sí, él vomitó, la diarrhea, la nausea.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.986
What in Carmen Sandiego
is going on in Mexico?

08:48.494 --> 08:51.554
Yeah, man, you know, just like you said
in my yearbook, man...

08:51.664 --> 08:53.894
""We're gonna be
dang old friends for life,"" man.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.401
""Good luck. Good luck this summer.""
And you said, you'd dang--

08:57.503 --> 09:02.065
All right, all right. I give.
But you guys can't tell anyone.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.472
-You got it.
-No one to tell.

09:06.412 --> 09:10.007
They're temporarily diverting beer
down to Mexico.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.379
Alamo will be back on the shelves
in five days.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.546
Five days. We can wait that long.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.153
Easy.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.459
-Let's go to Mexico!
-Yeah, man!

09:24.564 --> 09:26.088
Let's go down
to that dang old Mexico, man.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.165
Shh.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.899
-I got shotgun.
-Yeah!

09:35.374 --> 09:37.706
Theresa, there is something
you should see here.

09:37.810 --> 09:42.406
Look. ""Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea.
Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea.""

09:42.515 --> 09:44.312
All of these calls were from Mexicans.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.409
Now, their Spanish wasn't great,
but I was able to gather...

09:47.520 --> 09:50.489
that they got sick after drinking Alamo.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.856
Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
That shows incredible initiative.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.987
Here. You've earned
an ""Alamo Can Do"" pin.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.561
Collect five of these
and you get a mini flashlight.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.964
A flashlight? Wow!

10:03.069 --> 10:06.732
I will think of you every time
something falls behind the couch.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.874
-Oh. And about the vomiting?
-Right.

10:09.976 --> 10:13.468
It seems that a tiny bit of soap
got into some of the machinery...

10:13.579 --> 10:16.343
during the production run we sent
to Mexico.

10:16.449 --> 10:20.385
It's our fault for wanting to give people
the cleanest beer they can buy.

10:20.486 --> 10:23.046
But rest assured,
no one is in any real danger.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.213
Oh, thank goodness.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.382
So I can just tell the callers that the soap--

10:26.492 --> 10:27.481
No!

10:27.593 --> 10:30.084
Our Corporate Affairs Department
is working 24/7...

10:30.196 --> 10:33.097
to determine the best way
to handle the recall announcements.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.360
So, for the time being....

10:35.468 --> 10:36.435
Shh.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.301
I don't mean to sound racist...

10:43.409 --> 10:47.345
but this is by far the best selection
of beans I have ever seen.

10:47.446 --> 10:48.708
I'm serious.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.475
-Tacos! Can I buy one?
-No.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.745
How about some pigs' feet?
They look clean.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.185
No. No food. You're gonna get sick.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.951
And this isn't some two-mile ride home
from a pie-eating contest.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.857
How about a banana?
It comes in its own wrapper.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.122
Fine.

11:04.997 --> 11:09.195
Por favor, cervezas Alamo?

11:13.139 --> 11:14.197
Wow!

11:17.276 --> 11:18.402
[Rooster crowing]

11:19.979 --> 11:20.968
Yup.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.570
-Yup.
-Yup.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.113
One beer's not gonna hurt my driving.
Look how fat I am.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.448
Sorry, Bill. That's what you get
for having a mouthful of banana...

11:29.555 --> 11:31.682
when we all said ""not it.""

11:34.827 --> 11:36.454
HANK: Dang those bananas.

11:36.562 --> 11:37.722
DALE: Step on it, Bill.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.958
I don't know which way it's coming out,
but it's coming out.

11:52.645 --> 11:53.805
[Groaning]

11:58.217 --> 11:59.946
Stage oie complete,

12:03.322 --> 12:04.516
Finally.

12:06.826 --> 12:07.884
Yup.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.119
So how was everyone's day?

12:12.164 --> 12:13.631
Pretty boring.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.270
You know, watched some.... Oh, God.

12:20.606 --> 12:24.042
I had an interesting encounter
with a mosquito today.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.544
Wait, let me back up.
It was lunchtime and....

12:27.847 --> 12:31.613
Then I said to the nurse,
""No, I'm not sure it was a mosquito...

12:31.717 --> 12:36.347
""but it was some sort of bug
that bit me and now I itch.""

12:36.455 --> 12:39.219
Long story short, calamine lotion.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.124
Hank, why aren't you eating?

12:44.063 --> 12:45.690
I'm savoring it...

12:46.065 --> 12:49.762
and going to the bathroom.
The two are not related.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.462
[Hank groaning]

12:55.574 --> 12:58.065
-What are you doing?
-Just had to...

12:58.177 --> 12:59.439
[Hank farting]

13:01.580 --> 13:02.547
comb.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.411
Honey, are you sick?

13:05.184 --> 13:07.846
Yeah. All right, I admit it.

13:07.953 --> 13:11.445
I got this diarrhea and vomiting.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.793
Hank, if you can hear me
over your own noises...

13:15.895 --> 13:17.795
where did you go today?

13:18.564 --> 13:22.591
-I went with the guys down to Mexico.
-You went to Mexico?

13:25.704 --> 13:26.864
[Gasping]

13:30.543 --> 13:33.410
My beer. Peggy, have you lost your mind?

13:33.612 --> 13:37.070
Oh, so now I'm insane?
You broke a promise to me.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.641
A promise you made in the bed
where I conceived our son.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.482
That is insane.

13:43.956 --> 13:48.859
Okay, I'm sorry I blabbed to the guys.
But the beer is already here.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.862
There's no sense in pouring it down
the drain and back to Mexico.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.626
-Hank, you cannot drink it.
-Why the hell not?

13:54.733 --> 13:58.965
I got diarrhea from Mexican bananas
trying to get this Alamo.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.299
You're just punishing me...

14:00.406 --> 14:02.840
because I told the guys
the beer was down there.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.842
It is not that.

14:04.944 --> 14:08.744
You are just gonna have to trust me
more than I can trust you.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.214
I wish I could say more but I cannot.

14:11.317 --> 14:14.912
This tiny flashlight symbolizes
the huge amount of trust...

14:15.020 --> 14:16.487
that Alamo has placed in me.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.650
My God! You care more about
your stupid confidentiality agreement...

14:20.759 --> 14:22.124
than your own husband.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.458
And you care more
about your friends and your beer...

14:24.563 --> 14:27.293
than you do about
my stupid confidentiality agreement.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.697
Besides, it's for your own good.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.135
For my own....
What am l, some kind of baby?

14:33.239 --> 14:35.173
Well, baby wants a beer.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.439
Fine, Hank, drink up.

14:39.411 --> 14:42.539
Where does Peggy get off
being so mad at me?

14:42.648 --> 14:45.640
Yes, I broke her confidence
and lied about it...

14:45.751 --> 14:48.618
but she, well, she....

14:49.588 --> 14:52.022
She's still keeping something from me.

14:52.358 --> 14:54.553
Exactly, Hank. She....

14:54.727 --> 14:55.955
[Vomiting]

14:56.328 --> 14:58.762
Damn that filthy Mexican banana!

14:58.864 --> 15:00.855
Don't blame the bananas.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.400
I ate more than anyone, peels included.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.471
And I didn't get sick
until hours after you guys did.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.666
We had bananas and beer. We came home.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.134
What else could have made us sick?

15:12.244 --> 15:15.042
Oh, my God, the beer!

15:16.682 --> 15:18.115
And Peggy knew.

15:18.384 --> 15:19.351
[Bill farting]

15:22.388 --> 15:25.323
-Hello, Peggy.
-Oh! Oh, hi, Hank.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.291
You remember
that old Alamo Beer commercial?

15:28.394 --> 15:31.921
The one where the father and son
have a fight over who dented the car...

15:32.031 --> 15:34.659
and then they make up over a cold Alamo?

15:34.767 --> 15:37.497
Well, Peggy, I dented your trust.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.462
And I want to make up.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.635
Well, that's okay, Hank. I forgive you.

15:44.109 --> 15:48.011
Please, after what I've done to you,
you deserve it.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.781
Unless there's a reason
you don't want to drink it.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.746
There's no.... I can't think of a....

15:56.855 --> 15:58.345
[Peggy laughing nervously]

16:15.040 --> 16:16.302
[Peggy groaning]

16:21.747 --> 16:25.444
My wife lies to me,
my beer company betrays me...

16:25.551 --> 16:28.611
Americans are giving Mexicans diarrhea.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.184
What the hell's going on here?

16:33.625 --> 16:37.789
This is just a stomach flu,
which you gave me. Thanks a lot, Hank.

16:38.397 --> 16:42.060
Where are you going, to put
some laxative in Bobby's Cocoa Puffs?

16:42.167 --> 16:45.728
I am off to work
where I can vomit without being accused.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.633
What is going on
with the recall announcement?

16:50.743 --> 16:51.903
I have seen nothing about it...

16:52.011 --> 16:54.002
in the beverage trade magazines
in the ladies' room.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.343
It turns out, according to Mexican law...

16:56.448 --> 17:00.077
the market that sold tainted beer
could be held responsible.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.244
And if those markets are shut down...

17:02.354 --> 17:05.221
where will the people of Mexico
buy food for their children?

17:05.324 --> 17:09.988
Alamo is against child starvation, Peggy.
We always have been. How about you?

17:10.262 --> 17:13.925
Well, of course.
But I'm also against people with diarrhea.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.028
Isn't there any way to warn them?

17:16.135 --> 17:18.603
Oh, Peggy.
I know what you're going through.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.299
That's why I married someone
in the company, a barley man.

17:28.313 --> 17:31.305
Hola, Alamo Beer, Sí,

17:32.084 --> 17:35.952
Sí, él vomitó, Sí, sí, la diarrhea.

17:41.860 --> 17:46.024
Excuse me, I demand
to see Mr. Meinhoffer lV.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.458
I'm sorry, sir,
but without an appointment--

17:48.567 --> 17:50.831
I know you're just trying to do your job...

17:50.936 --> 17:54.337
but there is no way you were trained
to deal with a customer...

17:54.440 --> 17:56.670
as dissatisfied as I am.

17:56.775 --> 17:59.107
I want to open the
board meeting tomorrow with a joke.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.543
Not to tie your hands,
but maybe something about a giraffe?

18:01.647 --> 18:03.444
Mr. Meinhoffer lV?

18:03.549 --> 18:06.143
I'm Hank Hill, Strickland Propane.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.218
For the last 20 years,
Alamo has been a part of my family...

18:10.322 --> 18:13.416
Iike a favorite uncle
who lives in the refrigerator.

18:13.525 --> 18:18.121
But you knowingly sold tainted beer
to the good people of Mexico.

18:18.397 --> 18:22.766
That is not a crime, but it should be.
Now, I would like an apology.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.928
Mr. Strickland, Alamo Beer
is not your uncle. We are not your family.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.133
We are
a Delaware limited liability corporation...

18:30.242 --> 18:34.838
and the beer we sell in Mexico
is as pure as the beer we sell in America.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.209
What? He's lying.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.875
So unless you
are one of our shareholders...

18:38.984 --> 18:42.317
we don't owe you anything,
especially an apology.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.046
We will not stand by...

18:44.156 --> 18:47.557
while you libel our product
with your baseless accusations.

18:47.659 --> 18:51.755
Now, I am not a litigious man.
That's why I have lawyers.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.198
-Are you threatening me?
-I don't threaten people.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.734
That's why I have security guards.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.401
You're kicking me out? Okay, fine.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.669
I'm kicking you out of my refrigerator.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.440
Bobby, put down that tainted beer.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.539
I was hoping
it would not have to come to this...

19:11.650 --> 19:14.813
but, it looks like
I have to take down the system.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.365
Paychecks coming through.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.565
-Thank God it's Alamost Friday, huh?
-Yeah.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.296
[Elevator bell dinging]

20:07.739 --> 20:11.175
So, the freaking giraffe orders a beer
and the bartender says...

20:11.276 --> 20:13.608
""You want a long neck?""
And the giraffe goes...

20:13.712 --> 20:15.373
""l have a choice?""

20:15.480 --> 20:16.708
[Men laughing]

20:32.531 --> 20:34.158
MElNHOFFER: This beer's fresh off the line.

20:34.266 --> 20:37.394
We've already shipped it all over Texas.
Oh, God!

20:37.502 --> 20:38.469
[Coughing]

20:38.570 --> 20:39.537
[Toilet flushing]

20:40.105 --> 20:44.838
Hi, I'm Conrad Meinhoffer lV,
CEO of Alamo Brewing Company.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.709
Kids, run along and play.
Daddy needs to talk to his friends.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.476

Because we're iot just a compaiy,

21:16.475 --> 21:19.808
There. I don't understand
why that was so hard.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.573
But why couldn't he just apologize
to my face?

21:22.681 --> 21:25.673
Well, sometimes, when people
are confronted with their mistakes...

21:25.784 --> 21:28.810
they're too embarrassed
to admit they're wrong.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.420
Especially proud people,
your successful businessmen...

21:32.524 --> 21:36.187
your educators, your substitute educators.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.857
-I'm sorry, Hank.
-No, Peggy, I'm sorry.

21:41.733 --> 21:44.133
Hey, look. There's Hops, the dog.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.364
PEGGY: Actually, the real Hops
died five years ago.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.441
It's one of the company secrets. Pass it on.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.110
