00:20.187 --> 00:21.772
<i>It's Clara.
I'm not in.</i>

00:21.772 --> 00:23.858
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

00:23.858 --> 00:25.860
<i>Clara, it's me again.</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:28.446
<i>I'm just calling to see...</i>

00:28.446 --> 00:30.364
if you'd pick up.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.662
I miss you.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.590
Today is a momentous day...

00:47.590 --> 00:51.719
a historic day as former German
Chancellor Adolf Hitler...

00:51.719 --> 00:55.222
...is set to be tried for crimes
against humanity...

00:55.222 --> 00:57.349
...by an International
Criminal Tribunal.

00:58.768 --> 01:00.227
 <i>It is
the culmination</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:01.604
of a surreal two months

01:01.604 --> 01:03.397
<i>in which dental records</i>

01:03.397 --> 01:05.733
<i>and fingerprints have
proved the veracity of...</i>

01:05.733 --> 01:07.359
Investigations have been opened

01:07.359 --> 01:09.987
as to how Hitler...

01:09.987 --> 01:14.825
...was able to stage
his own death and evade justice.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.619
It is
believed that a group of...

01:16.619 --> 01:19.205
...undercover "Nazi hunters"
were involved...

01:19.205 --> 01:20.748
...in bringing Mr. Hitler
to justice.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.126
Only one member of the group
has been publicly identified.

01:24.126 --> 01:27.171
<i>The woman who single-handedly
walked Adolf Hitler</i>

01:27.171 --> 01:29.924
into the American Embassy
in Uruguay.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.550
Former
FBI Agent...

01:31.550 --> 01:33.511
Former agent
of the American FBI...

01:33.511 --> 01:35.346
- Millicent Morris.
- Millicent Morris.

01:35.346 --> 01:36.639
Will you tell us
how you caught him?

01:36.639 --> 01:37.723
Who else were you working with?

01:37.723 --> 01:38.808
Do you want to see him hanged?

01:38.808 --> 01:39.975
Should Hitler be put to death?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.112
Hey, you okay?

02:36.991 --> 02:40.536
I wish my Murray
was here to see this.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.960
He is here.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.088
He's seeing this.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.268
<i>He owns a toy shop
in Manhattan?</i>

03:04.268 --> 03:05.811
<i>Yes,
Heinz Richter opened</i>

03:05.811 --> 03:08.314
The Red Balloon Toy Shop
20 years ago.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.024
He lives alone in Forest Hills.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.067
They... we're very close.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.194
But we need more.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.238
- More?
- Yes, we need more.

03:16.238 --> 03:19.283
We need to be 100% certain.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.244
- Oh, but Ruth...
- No, she's right. He...

03:22.244 --> 03:24.538
He's a collector, this man.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.290
He has something

03:26.290 --> 03:28.375
of his former life with him.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.461
I can assure you that.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.756
Break in.

03:33.756 --> 03:35.966
- See what you find.
- Meyer, that could expose us.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.551
Killing an innocent man?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.763
That will expose us to things
we could never recover from.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.808
We're very close here,
but you must verify.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.895
I will see what I can do.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.230
Good.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.069
Ah, yes.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.406
After all these years...

03:59.406 --> 04:02.660
to think that we may have
finally found him is...

04:02.660 --> 04:05.120
Look what we created.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.458
It's great.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.253
It's not the only thing
we created, Meyer.

04:14.505 --> 04:17.841
She was a beautiful girl,

04:17.841 --> 04:20.469
- Naomi.
- My mother's name.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.931
Your mother was a saint.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.975
So...

04:25.975 --> 04:28.268
so I thought it would rub off.

04:29.311 --> 04:33.107
But she was a pain the ass. Naomi.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.943
Precocious, bold.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.486
Like her mother.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.906
But she was also
like her father.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.409
She was kind, good.

04:43.409 --> 04:48.622
I wish...
oh, I wish you met her.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.542
Oh, I... I wish I did, too.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.837
Look at me, Meyer.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.839
Look.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.758
She had your eyes.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.262
Yeah.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.765
I...

05:15.858 --> 05:18.027
I remember.

05:18.027 --> 05:21.363
When he did this to you
in that awful room.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.700
I could feel it, too, I suppose.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.119
Seared...

05:27.119 --> 05:29.121
on my own heart.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.791
So many scars, Ruth.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.376
Hmm?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.253
Yes.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.422
What are we but scars?

05:44.762 --> 05:46.847
I'm so glad...

05:48.682 --> 05:50.809
...that I found you.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.606
Finally...

05:55.606 --> 05:58.525
I've found you.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.946
Let him live! Let him live!

07:25.946 --> 07:28.407
Security is on high alert

07:28.407 --> 07:30.784
at the Munich courthouse.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.203
Germany has received
credible threats...

07:33.203 --> 07:37.082
...of a possible terror attack
from white supremacist groups.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.585
An emotional day is expected...

07:39.585 --> 07:40.669
...as spectators
include survivors

07:40.669 --> 07:41.962
of the Nazi concentration camps.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.047
Gosh, he looks old.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.844
Yeah.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.262
Authorities are afraid

07:50.262 --> 07:51.805
of an attack.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.600
And they should be afraid.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.480
Showtime.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.123
 <i>Hitler will
be tried by five justices:</i>

08:18.123 --> 08:21.793
<i>Boris Federov of Russia,
Marion Jenneret of France,</i>

08:21.793 --> 08:24.338
<i>Archibald Hollings
of Great Britain,</i>

08:24.338 --> 08:26.465
<i>Lorraine Collins of the U.S.,</i>

08:26.465 --> 08:29.593
<i>and Chief Justice
Wolfgang Müeller of Germany,</i>

08:29.593 --> 08:32.304
<i>whose objectivity
has come into question</i>

08:32.304 --> 08:35.432
due to his alleged ties to the
Nazi regime as a law student.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.143
Justice Müeller
has not commented

08:38.143 --> 08:39.978
- on the allegations.
<i>- We are gathered here</i>

08:39.978 --> 08:42.397
for the International
War Crimes Tribunal

08:42.397 --> 08:43.523
in the name of the people

08:43.523 --> 08:44.775
in the criminal case

08:44.775 --> 08:46.360
against Adolf Hitler.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.695
Many have declared this case

08:48.695 --> 08:50.405
to be the trial
of the millennium.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.659
I would offer
that in this courtroom,

08:53.659 --> 08:56.286
with this agent of the court
presiding over it,

08:56.286 --> 08:59.206
this will be a trial
like any other.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.042
We are simply here
to establish this individual's

09:02.042 --> 09:04.836
innocence or guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt

09:04.836 --> 09:07.256
of the crimes
of which he is accused.

09:08.257 --> 09:11.260
Remember, my fellow justices
and I must arrive

09:11.260 --> 09:13.595
at a unanimous decision
before the ruling

09:13.595 --> 09:15.430
is considered final.

09:17.975 --> 09:21.645
Mr. Frankel,
it's the prosecution's case.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.652
Though it is no exaggeration
to say that our case has been

09:28.652 --> 09:32.114
a Herculean task--

09:32.114 --> 09:35.909
to tally the grave offenses
of the accused...

09:37.536 --> 09:39.538
...Adolf Hitler.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.959
The fact is...

09:43.959 --> 09:46.211
our case is
a relatively simple one.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.547
Given the work
of our predecessors

09:48.547 --> 09:50.382
and the precedent established

09:50.382 --> 09:52.551
by the International
Military Tribunal at Nuremberg

09:52.551 --> 09:54.136
and the subsequent trials
in the period

09:54.136 --> 09:55.721
immediately after the war.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.639
It is therefore our contention

09:57.639 --> 10:00.142
that we will present to you...

10:01.852 --> 10:03.979
...an open and shut,

10:03.979 --> 10:06.064
airtight case.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.280
Thank you,
Mr. Frankel.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.075
The defense may now rise
and state

10:17.075 --> 10:19.411
their case.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.788
Knock 'em dead.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.672
Traitor. Traitor!

10:30.672 --> 10:34.217
Traitor!

10:34.217 --> 10:36.136
You're a Jew!

10:36.136 --> 10:37.637
- How can you represent him?
- Order!
There will be order.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.015
Your Honors.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.184
I, um...

10:42.184 --> 10:45.312
I stand before you

10:45.312 --> 10:49.107
on behalf of my client,
Adolf Hitler.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.860
And, um...

10:51.860 --> 10:54.404
I...

10:56.907 --> 10:59.117
I am not here to argue

10:59.117 --> 11:00.535
that...

11:00.535 --> 11:02.662
my client is not a monster.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.248
That he wasn't a dictator

11:05.248 --> 11:08.460
or even a murderer.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.130
I am here to defend his right

11:12.130 --> 11:15.425
to a free and fair trial.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.220
And I am here...

11:18.220 --> 11:20.847
to argue that Adolf Hitler...

11:20.847 --> 11:23.058
should be found not guilty

11:23.058 --> 11:25.143
of the specific charges
he is accused of.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.566
Thank you.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.569
Let us proceed.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.821
<i>Please,</i>

11:35.821 --> 11:38.115
tell us your occupation,
Mr. Speer,

11:38.115 --> 11:40.826
between 1942 and 1945.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.414
I served the Reich as minister
of armaments and war production.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.335
This is an affidavit,
which you signed in Munich.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.213
Would you please read the

11:53.213 --> 11:54.631
highlighted section
to the court.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.555
"Hatred of the Jews was Hitler's

12:01.555 --> 12:04.933
"motor and central point.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.395
"Perhaps even the very element
that motivated him.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.441
"I was present at
the session of the Reichstag

12:12.441 --> 12:14.901
"of 30th January 1939,

12:14.901 --> 12:17.904
"when Hitler assured us

12:17.904 --> 12:20.782
"that in case of a war,

12:20.782 --> 12:23.201
"not the Germans,

12:23.201 --> 12:25.871
but the Jews
would be annihilated."

12:25.871 --> 12:28.373
Tell me,
when did you first learn

12:28.373 --> 12:30.125
of Adolf Hitler's plan
to exterminate

12:30.125 --> 12:31.543
Europe's Jewish population?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.920
Uh, Objection, Your Honors. Leading.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.797
Objection sustained.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.674
I'll move on.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.677
In 1945, Hitler issued
his so-called Nero Decree.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.762
What did this policy call for?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.765
Anything of value
within Reich territory

12:45.765 --> 12:47.642
that could be used by the enemy

12:47.642 --> 12:49.686
for the prosecution of the war

12:49.686 --> 12:52.481
was to be destroyed.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.608
And why did he issue this order?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.109
Objection, Your Honors.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.736
- Speculation.
- Sustained.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.279
Your Honors, this witness
will have insight into

12:59.279 --> 13:00.572
- the reasoning behind...
- I've ruled.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.034
Move along, Counsel.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.746
Tell me.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.165
When you last saw Adolf Hitler

13:10.165 --> 13:12.375
in his bunker in Berlin,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.377
what did he say to you?

13:14.377 --> 13:15.795
He said...

13:17.297 --> 13:19.508
...his biggest regret
was that he hadn't

13:19.508 --> 13:22.135
finished off the Jews.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.848
And why do you think
that was his biggest regret?

13:26.848 --> 13:29.226
Objection, Your Honors.
Again, speculation.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.853
- Objection sustained.
- Your honors, it is
perfectly within the...

13:31.853 --> 13:34.105
- I said sustained.
- ...perfectly within
the prosecution's right

13:34.105 --> 13:36.233
- to question the witness
in this way!
- I said sustained, Counsel!

13:36.233 --> 13:38.818
Mm, you did.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.656
Bullshit.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.369
Counsels, in our chambers.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.956
Beg your pardon,
but are you gonna allow me

13:50.956 --> 13:52.624
to get more than
a question in before sustaining

13:52.624 --> 13:55.043
some errant,
extralegal objection?

13:57.254 --> 13:58.838
Are you finished?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.260
Yes.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.345
Your Honors.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.805
I'd like to
remind you, Counsel,

14:06.805 --> 14:08.682
that the burden of proof
in this case

14:08.682 --> 14:11.476
falls on you.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.853
You must firmly establish
Hitler's culpability

14:13.853 --> 14:16.648
for crimes against peace,
war crimes,

14:16.648 --> 14:19.067
crimes against humanity,
and conspiracy

14:19.067 --> 14:21.486
to commit
those foregoing crimes.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.197
The charges that you brought.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.616
Now, if you can do this,
beyond a reasonable doubt,

14:26.616 --> 14:29.035
then I shall rule in your favor.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.497
But if you can't,
I shall rule in his.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.418
It's as simple as that.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.546
Am I understood, Mr. Frankel?

14:40.797 --> 14:41.840
Yes.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.092
Good.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.528
Just doing my job.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.697
Doing the right thing.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.077
We're both Jewish, you and I,
and, yet, I suppose

15:11.077 --> 15:14.456
we have a very different idea
of what the "right thing" is.

15:17.626 --> 15:21.171
<i>We now move to call to the stand
the survivors of the Holocaust.</i>

15:21.171 --> 15:23.423
The court must move past
the abstraction

15:23.423 --> 15:26.384
of genocide and hear it

15:26.384 --> 15:28.219
from the victims themselves.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.846
You may proceed, Mr. Frankel.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.556
I now call to the stand

15:31.556 --> 15:33.433
Mrs. Mindy Markowitz

15:33.433 --> 15:35.393
of Brooklyn, New York,

15:35.393 --> 15:37.479
by way of Kalisz, Poland.

15:37.479 --> 15:41.191
<i>Would you please
state your name for the court?</i>

15:43.234 --> 15:46.696
Mindy Markowitz.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.823
Abraham Putnitsky.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.825
Esther Schwartzman.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.535
Vadoma Orsos.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.787
Isaac Wolff.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.622
Sara Weil.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.291
Would you tell us
where you were born?

15:58.291 --> 16:01.586
Kalisz, Poland.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.879
Berlin, Germany.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.382
Ostrava, Czechoslovakia.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.301
Zalaegerszeg, Hungary.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.386
Vienna, Austria.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.054
Lodz, Poland.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.806
Could you please tell us

16:12.806 --> 16:15.016
what happened to you

16:15.016 --> 16:17.644
under the Nazi regime?

16:20.689 --> 16:22.732
The gestapo

16:22.732 --> 16:24.859
took us from

16:24.859 --> 16:27.779
our small apartment...

16:27.779 --> 16:31.408
and forced us onto cattle cars.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.743
- Objection, Your Honors.
- What?

16:33.743 --> 16:36.621
On what grounds, Counselor?

16:36.621 --> 16:39.874
I am deeply sorry
for what Mrs...

16:39.874 --> 16:42.293
Markowitz has gone through,
but I object

16:42.293 --> 16:44.546
on the grounds of relevancy.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.715
Your Honors.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.592
At a time when the truth

16:49.592 --> 16:52.053
about the Holocaust
is frequently

16:52.053 --> 16:53.972
and fervently denied...

16:53.972 --> 16:56.224
belittled

16:56.224 --> 16:58.476
and whitewashed...

16:58.476 --> 16:59.978
it is important to establish

16:59.978 --> 17:01.938
the fundamental truth

17:01.938 --> 17:04.816
that the Holocaust happened.

17:04.816 --> 17:08.820
That it was a systematic
campaign of genocide

17:08.820 --> 17:11.072
by actors and nations--

17:11.072 --> 17:14.284
many of whom wish it could
be written off as a fantasy--

17:14.284 --> 17:17.120
that resulted in the deaths

17:17.120 --> 17:19.539
of 11 million

17:19.539 --> 17:21.499
men, women

17:21.499 --> 17:23.877
and children.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.630
And was conceived and executed

17:27.630 --> 17:29.799
by the man who sits

17:29.799 --> 17:31.885
in that glass box.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.055
If these survivors' testimony
of their experience

17:36.055 --> 17:39.476
is not relevant, Your Honors...

17:39.476 --> 17:42.687
well, I don't know what is.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.065
Overruled.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.485
You may proceed,

17:48.485 --> 17:50.779
Mrs. Markowitz.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.324
There... there were dozens of us

17:54.324 --> 17:56.701
in the cattle car.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.579
No room to sit
or go to the bathroom.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.790
Hardly any air.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.209
The Nazi guard shot my father

18:04.209 --> 18:06.753
right in front of me.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.047
My mother, too.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.216
And then he laughed.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.926
"Left, right."

18:13.968 --> 18:16.054
That's what the Nazi guard said.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.180
They marched her

18:17.180 --> 18:20.099
right into the gas chambers.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.559
We saw

18:21.559 --> 18:24.312
the awful black smoke

18:24.312 --> 18:25.688
coming from the crematoria.

18:25.688 --> 18:26.940
<i>She was</i>

18:26.940 --> 18:29.067
seven years old.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.487
My daughter.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.698
My boyfriend and I were forced
to go on a death march.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.368
Half-naked, emaciated.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.745
Snow falling on our heads

18:40.745 --> 18:43.081
as we heard the allied gunfire
from the distance.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.332
<i>The guards</i>

18:44.332 --> 18:46.251
assigned me the role

18:46.251 --> 18:49.379
of loading the dead bodies

18:49.379 --> 18:52.215
into a mass grave.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.262
I couldn't bear it,

18:57.262 --> 18:59.639
so I ran away.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.604
He was a beautiful boy.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.065
Aaron.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.528
When we got to the camps...

19:13.528 --> 19:16.281
the Nazis tried

19:16.281 --> 19:18.449
to separate us.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.705
My husband, Murray...

19:23.705 --> 19:26.875
wouldn't let go of Aaron.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.254
The Nazi guard...

19:32.422 --> 19:35.049
...r-ripped Aaron

19:35.049 --> 19:38.011
from Murray's arms...

19:38.011 --> 19:41.055
and shot my little boy

19:41.055 --> 19:43.433
<i>in the chest.</i>

19:45.101 --> 19:48.229
I miss him every day.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.107
I miss my Murray, too.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.817
<i>Mein velt.</i>

19:52.817 --> 19:55.904
How life
would have been different

19:55.904 --> 19:58.698
if not for all this.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.870
If not for you.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.834
I have long dreamt of this day.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.920
The day...

20:13.338 --> 20:15.465
...when I would face you...

20:16.966 --> 20:21.429
- ...and say to you how I felt.
- Objection, Your Honors.

20:21.429 --> 20:24.641
- Mrs. Markowitz!
- The day when I could
finally be heard.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.143
Mrs. Markowitz,
you must address your comments

20:27.143 --> 20:29.479
to the bench,
not to the defendant.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.318
I was just a young girl
before it all.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.613
I liked to dance to Marlene,

20:38.613 --> 20:42.075
read dime novels,
study my engineering.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.204
I was just a person.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.792
We were just people.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.713
And you tried

20:55.713 --> 20:58.591
to exterminate us.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.178
To bid us extinct.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.389
But now...

21:04.389 --> 21:06.599
you are in our arena.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.601
- Your Honors...
- Mrs. Markowitz!

21:08.601 --> 21:10.269
A hall of law.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.897
You tried to bury us.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.441
But we were seeds.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.361
And we grew back stronger.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.572
And our branches...

21:22.782 --> 21:24.617
...reach...

21:24.617 --> 21:26.411
toward the light

21:26.411 --> 21:27.704
of justice!

21:27.704 --> 21:31.624
- Mrs. Markowitz...
- We survived to tell the story.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.086
And we will never,

21:35.086 --> 21:37.130
ever let

21:37.130 --> 21:39.257
the world forget.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.967
Mrs. Markowitz,
that is enough...

21:40.967 --> 21:43.052
That's it. All done.

21:45.847 --> 21:49.267
He doesn't deserve...

21:49.267 --> 21:51.477
any more...

21:51.477 --> 21:53.813
of my breath

21:53.813 --> 21:56.232
or thoughts

21:56.232 --> 21:59.569
or words.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.405
That is all, Your Honors.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.490
Mr. Kramer?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.411
We have no further questions,
Your Honors.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.537
<i>Nein!</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:16.252
Uh, just-just a moment
with my client?

22:19.714 --> 22:21.549
Cross-examine her.

22:21.549 --> 22:22.633
She lied.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.052
She didn't lie.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.261
She is a liar.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.721
And if they--

22:26.721 --> 22:28.639
these people--
lied about this...

22:28.639 --> 22:30.558
They didn't lie.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.769
- Expose her.
- Mr. Kramer?

22:32.769 --> 22:34.187
Just-just a moment, Your Honor?

22:34.187 --> 22:36.814
They all lie.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.734
They exaggerate. We are merely

22:39.734 --> 22:41.652
moving them out of the country.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.571
Your Honors,
we have no further questions.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.697
Yes, we do.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.116
We have many questions.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.413
What are you doing?

22:52.413 --> 22:53.831
- Question her.
- No.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.917
Then you're fired.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.170
You want to represent yourself?

22:59.170 --> 23:00.505
Mr. Kramer.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.840
Just-just a second, Judge.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.842
You think
the justices and the world

23:04.842 --> 23:07.095
are not gonna see
a raving lunatic?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.597
I'm the only person standing in
the way of you getting hanged.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.682
So, tell me...
so you want me to,

23:11.682 --> 23:13.726
you want me to further
the big lie? You want me to...

23:13.726 --> 23:16.604
distort their words,
try and poke holes

23:16.604 --> 23:19.398
in their accurate recollections?

23:19.398 --> 23:22.318
Then you can hang yourself.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.403
What'll it be?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.784
We have no questions,
Your Honors.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.828
Thank you,
Mrs. Markowitz.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.372
Court is
now adjourned for the day.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.457
<i>The trial heads
into its third day today,</i>

23:36.457 --> 23:39.043
<i>as prosecuting attorney
Oliver Frankel</i>

23:39.043 --> 23:41.879
<i>is set to deliver his argument
to the court.</i>

23:58.312 --> 24:00.273
This...

24:01.816 --> 24:03.484
...is the man
who started all of this.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.862
In 1935,

24:05.862 --> 24:07.655
the Nazis introduced
racial laws which

24:07.655 --> 24:10.533
divested Jews
of their rights of citizenship.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.870
Who was chancellor
of Germany at that time?

24:13.870 --> 24:15.621
Adolf Hitler.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.915
In '41,

24:17.915 --> 24:19.625
the Nazis invaded
the Soviet Union.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.460
When the mass murder of the Jews

24:21.460 --> 24:24.922
began,
who was chancellor of Germany

24:24.922 --> 24:26.757
at that time?

24:26.757 --> 24:28.426
Adolf Hitler.

24:28.426 --> 24:30.553
In January '42, documents detail

24:30.553 --> 24:32.972
the Wannsee Conference in
Berlin, where Hitler's scheme

24:32.972 --> 24:35.349
the Final Solution--

24:35.349 --> 24:38.227
the permanent extermination
of the Jewish people--

24:38.227 --> 24:41.772
was coordinated and discussed
by his chief lieutenants

24:41.772 --> 24:44.942
on his order.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.653
The Earth is round.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.657
The sky is blue.

24:53.451 --> 24:57.205
And Adolf Hitler is responsible

24:57.205 --> 24:59.582
for the murder

24:59.582 --> 25:01.834
of 11 million Jews,

25:01.834 --> 25:05.254
Romani, homosexuals,

25:05.254 --> 25:08.216
political dissidents,

25:08.216 --> 25:11.260
Communists, Poles,

25:11.260 --> 25:15.473
and countless others

25:15.473 --> 25:17.141
during his reign...

25:19.018 --> 25:21.020
...of genocide.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.236
The prosecution rests,
Your Honors.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.466
Hello?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.010
Uh...

26:34.010 --> 26:35.886
is this Heinz Richter?

26:38.139 --> 26:39.640
Who is this?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.517
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

26:41.517 --> 26:44.520
<i>I'm here to tell you
that there is a woman.</i>

26:44.520 --> 26:47.315
<i>A survivor who has found you.</i>

26:47.315 --> 26:49.567
And you would do well

26:49.567 --> 26:52.028
to see that you find her first.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.030
<i>Do you understand
what I'm saying?</i>

26:54.030 --> 26:55.364
Who are you?

26:55.364 --> 26:59.535
Her name is Ruth Heidelbaum.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.330
<i>2513 73rd Street.</i>

27:02.330 --> 27:03.873
<i>Brooklyn.</i>

27:03.873 --> 27:05.291
Did you get that down?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.918
Who is this?!
My honor is called loyalty.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.348
Hello?

27:20.348 --> 27:21.557
<i>It's me, Ruthie.</i>

27:21.557 --> 27:23.476
<i>Just checking on you.</i>

27:23.476 --> 27:25.519
I'm fine, Mindeleh.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.313
Thank you.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.024
We should talk tomorrow, though.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.610
There's something...

27:32.610 --> 27:35.446
there's something I've found.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.708
 <i>It's day five
of the trial of the century,</i>

27:47.708 --> 27:49.752
<i>and Adolf Hitler's
defense attorney</i>

27:49.752 --> 27:52.338
<i>Benjamin Kramer began
his arguments in court today.</i>

27:52.338 --> 27:53.589
Reflecting
a strategy that is...

27:53.589 --> 27:56.092
..."Throw everything at the wall
and see what sticks".

27:56.092 --> 27:58.219
<i>On one point almost everyone</i>

27:58.219 --> 28:00.096
<i>around the world is in accord--</i>

28:00.096 --> 28:03.432
<i>that Hitler's attorney has
exhausted all his options,</i>

28:03.432 --> 28:06.727
<i>which leaves only one question
for Mr. Kramer's strategy.</i>

28:06.727 --> 28:08.979
<i>Will Hitler take the stand?</i>

28:08.979 --> 28:11.273
Hey.
What the fuck are you doing?

28:11.273 --> 28:13.901
You can't put him
on the fucking stand.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.861
- Why not?
- "Why not?"

28:15.861 --> 28:18.531
Because you're giving him
free airtime.

28:18.531 --> 28:21.075
To millions of people
around the world.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.619
Another... another soapbox,
another bully pulpit,

28:23.619 --> 28:25.287
another fucking TV show!

28:27.498 --> 28:29.125
He has a right to a defense.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.086
At what cost?

28:32.086 --> 28:34.422
- Oliver...
- He will proselytize.

28:34.422 --> 28:36.507
He will... lie.

28:36.507 --> 28:39.427
He will deny, he will
indoctrinate, he will incite.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.263
He will raise a new generation.
No!

28:44.640 --> 28:47.017
You cannot allow this.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.436
You better do
a good job in cross.

28:48.436 --> 28:49.645
It's his right.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.066
Do you want
to be responsible...?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.693
It's his right.

28:55.693 --> 28:57.153
Even he has rights.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.363
If he doesn't have rights,
then what are we?

29:08.289 --> 29:10.040
Do you want to be
responsible for raising in

29:10.040 --> 29:12.460
the next generation
of neo-Nazis?

29:13.502 --> 29:15.421
Of racists? Of...

29:15.421 --> 29:18.382
anti-Semites? Of mass murderers?

29:18.382 --> 29:21.886
If you put him on the stand...

29:21.886 --> 29:24.930
if you allow this...

29:28.350 --> 29:30.060
...what'll he be making of you?

29:31.353 --> 29:34.231
But if I don't...

29:34.231 --> 29:36.525
what'll he be making of us?

29:36.525 --> 29:39.236
This can't be a-a sham,

29:39.236 --> 29:41.864
a-a... a show trial,

29:41.864 --> 29:43.824
a kangaroo court...

29:43.824 --> 29:46.535
If we don't give him
a proper defense...

29:48.287 --> 29:50.539
- ...won't we be like him?
- No.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.625
No.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.295
You're a Jew, Ben.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.714
- I know.
- Yeah.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.425
You're a Jew.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.138
You doing this?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.437
This isn't just
a reflection on you.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.564
This is about all of us.

30:19.276 --> 30:22.530
What does this say about... us?

30:24.031 --> 30:26.408
That's why I'm doing this.

30:26.408 --> 30:29.453
Because of what it says
about us.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.918
<i>Do you swear
to tell the truth,</i>

30:35.918 --> 30:38.212
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

30:38.212 --> 30:39.964
so help you God?

30:39.964 --> 30:41.549
So help me God.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.471
You think it's a ploy?

30:48.514 --> 30:51.100
Every television set
in the world will be on him.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.561
He's up to something.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.482
It's the guards in here
I'm worried about.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.317
The MPs?

31:00.317 --> 31:02.319
Our contacts have checked
every one.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.446
We've confirmed their
backgrounds, their credentials,

31:04.446 --> 31:06.782
their identities.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.867
We all just keep our eyes open.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.502
<i>The defense has had
Adolf Hitler</i>

31:18.502 --> 31:20.879
on the stand for nearly an hour,
trying to create

31:20.879 --> 31:22.798
distance between
the former chancellor of Germany

31:22.798 --> 31:24.300
and his underlings.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.926
Did you ever order the deaths

31:25.926 --> 31:28.053
of six million Jews?

31:30.055 --> 31:32.433
No.

31:32.433 --> 31:35.644
Did you order
the death of 6,000 Jews?

31:35.644 --> 31:37.688
No.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.231
Did you order the death

31:39.231 --> 31:41.442
of a single Jew?

31:41.442 --> 31:43.944
I never ordered

31:43.944 --> 31:46.530
the killing of any Jew.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.116
And no document or paper

31:49.116 --> 31:51.785
will tell you otherwise.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.873
You American

31:55.873 --> 31:58.375
killed your Native Americans,

31:58.375 --> 32:00.502
enslaved

32:00.502 --> 32:02.046
Africans.

32:02.046 --> 32:03.797
You Brits, you put

32:03.797 --> 32:06.884
the Boers
into concentration camp.

32:06.884 --> 32:09.303
And you Soviets killed

32:09.303 --> 32:11.180
millions of people.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.099
And you sit there...

32:14.099 --> 32:16.310
to judge me?

32:21.023 --> 32:23.025
No further questions,
Your Honors.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.362
Your witness, Counsel.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.577
You say

32:33.577 --> 32:37.456
you were following
German laws by the books?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.750
That's right.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.252
You say that you were merely

32:42.252 --> 32:44.380
executing wartime duties

32:44.380 --> 32:47.758
and abiding by wartime
international statutes?

32:48.842 --> 32:50.219
That's right.

32:50.219 --> 32:51.553
You say that you never

32:51.553 --> 32:54.556
ordered the death
of a single individual

32:54.556 --> 32:57.059
during your reign as chancellor?

32:57.059 --> 32:59.311
That's right.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.647
I'm innocent.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.232
Innocent!

33:03.232 --> 33:05.901
Then if you broke no laws,
defied no conventions,

33:05.901 --> 33:07.861
why hide?

33:07.861 --> 33:09.863
Why hide away in Argentina?

33:09.863 --> 33:13.075
In a 200-hectare compound
with nowhere to go?

33:13.075 --> 33:14.451
I wasn't hiding.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.787
Ah, then-then,
then what were you doing?

33:16.787 --> 33:18.247
Vacationing.

33:18.247 --> 33:21.083
"Vacationing"?

33:21.083 --> 33:22.918
For 30 years?

33:22.918 --> 33:24.503
I earned it.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.839
I was in my summer home

33:26.839 --> 33:30.467
in Argentina,
enjoying the sun...

33:30.467 --> 33:34.263
relaxing and writing

33:34.263 --> 33:38.016
a new chapter for my memoirs.

33:38.016 --> 33:42.563
And working on a... a return.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.191
A return to what?

33:47.151 --> 33:49.278
Politics.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.280
You think...

33:51.280 --> 33:53.323
you would've been welcomed back?

33:53.323 --> 33:55.367
To the world stage?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.744
Everybody likes

33:56.744 --> 33:59.663
a good comeback story, no?

33:59.663 --> 34:01.790
You say you based your ideology

34:01.790 --> 34:03.459
on the notion
of the master race.

34:03.459 --> 34:06.128
Could you tell me
what this means, please?

34:06.128 --> 34:08.213
Objection,
Your Honors. Relevancy.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.799
All of Hitler's actions
were based on a single ideology.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.927
And at the core of that ideology
was the lie of the master race.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.804
To help establish criminality,

34:15.804 --> 34:17.931
it is important
to establish intent!

34:17.931 --> 34:20.517
Tread carefully, Mr. Frankel.

34:20.517 --> 34:23.771
So, again, this theory

34:23.771 --> 34:27.065
of the master race, could you
tell us what this means?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.692
This lie?

34:28.692 --> 34:30.152
It's not a theory.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.528
It's a fact.

34:31.528 --> 34:34.114
And yet you're here.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.784
In a prison jumpsuit

34:36.784 --> 34:38.869
and... shackles.

34:40.662 --> 34:43.457
Strange for a king, no?

34:43.457 --> 34:46.418
Because
of the Jewish conspiracy.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.587
Ah, "the Jewish conspiracy."

34:48.587 --> 34:51.632
- The age-old lie.
- Objection.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.759
- Overruled.
- So you're here
because of the Jews?

34:53.759 --> 34:55.844
Like me? How's that?

34:55.844 --> 34:57.429
Because of your lies.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.307
Lies. Lies about what?

35:00.307 --> 35:02.935
About the nature
of my involvement.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.270
So you were not involved

35:05.270 --> 35:07.648
in the extermination
of millions of men,

35:07.648 --> 35:09.233
women, children...

35:09.233 --> 35:11.026
and infants?

35:11.026 --> 35:12.986
Of course not.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.364
Won't your acolytes be...

35:15.364 --> 35:18.617
disappointed to hear that?

35:18.617 --> 35:21.829
There are many
racists and bigots

35:21.829 --> 35:25.290
out there, sir,
who still worship you, sir.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.751
Precisely because
you did architect

35:27.751 --> 35:30.796
the genocide
of six million Jews,

35:30.796 --> 35:34.550
hundreds of thousands
of Romani...

35:36.301 --> 35:38.303
...homosexuals...

35:40.180 --> 35:42.432
...and others.

35:42.432 --> 35:45.894
Are you saying that they are
wrong to worship you?

35:45.894 --> 35:48.689
Well, they're not wrong.

35:48.689 --> 35:51.775
I am a man
of many accomplishments.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.820
Of reformation and revolution.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.447
Of world order.

35:57.447 --> 36:00.200
World order.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.495
So you are responsible
for the Holocaust?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.122
I, um...

36:05.122 --> 36:07.457
So they are wrong
to idolize you?

36:07.457 --> 36:10.210
- No, they're...
- Well, which is it?! Either you

36:10.210 --> 36:12.754
deny your participation
in the Holocaust or...

36:12.754 --> 36:15.299
you take pride
in your extermination

36:15.299 --> 36:17.593
of millions of people.

36:17.593 --> 36:19.511
It cannot be both.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.972
This is what you do, you Jews.

36:21.972 --> 36:24.016
You twist words.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.393
You are responsible

36:26.393 --> 36:28.145
for what happened to you.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.730
Oh, of course we are. Right.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.356
We-We're responsible
for everything.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.108
For-for the plague.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.443
And earthquakes.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.028
The Great Depression.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.530
All the wars in the world.

36:39.907 --> 36:42.326
Disease and famine.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.453
Pain and misery.

36:44.453 --> 36:46.330
And all the evil.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.124
And all the darkness
in the world,

36:49.124 --> 36:51.668
which you have created.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.254
You villains!

36:55.255 --> 36:57.925
You vermin! You are scum!

36:57.925 --> 36:59.635
Is this why you were in hiding?

36:59.635 --> 37:02.512
- I wasn't hiding...
- 'Cause you're a rambling loon!

37:02.512 --> 37:04.431
A late-night show punch line!

37:04.431 --> 37:06.808
A drug addict
who's manic and lame

37:06.808 --> 37:09.311
and hateful
and pathetic and wrong!

37:09.311 --> 37:11.939
Who used
the basest tool of all, fear,

37:11.939 --> 37:13.690
to demonize

37:13.690 --> 37:15.859
and turn ignorant,
ignorant people

37:15.859 --> 37:17.611
against their fellow countrymen

37:17.611 --> 37:20.113
all to hold onto power?!

37:20.113 --> 37:21.907
- Objection.
- Sustained. Counsel?

37:21.907 --> 37:25.118
I am still
the leader of the party.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.120
What party?
The Nazi party no longer exists.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.081
I am the head of the Reich!

37:29.081 --> 37:31.959
West Germany's
a full-fledged democracy!

37:31.959 --> 37:34.461
You think I speak of Germany?

37:34.461 --> 37:37.255
I am the leader of a movement

37:37.255 --> 37:40.884
that has roots
in people's heart and minds,

37:40.884 --> 37:44.179
and in their blood and soil.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.642
Of course, I gave the order!

37:48.642 --> 37:51.103
- Your Honors?
My client has completely...
- Of course!

37:51.103 --> 37:53.689
- I had the visions...
- He admitted it!

37:53.689 --> 37:56.108
- Just a moment,
Your Honors!
- Of course, it's me!

37:56.108 --> 37:58.568
There will be order.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.696
And my people

38:00.696 --> 38:03.615
will still follow me.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.659
- You hear me?
- I do.

38:05.659 --> 38:06.827
You hear me?!

38:06.827 --> 38:08.912
I do.

38:10.414 --> 38:12.708
And we will be there
every minute

38:12.708 --> 38:15.168
of every day to combat it.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.133
We know that
it won't go away.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.468
We know that hatred

38:23.468 --> 38:25.470
and ignorance and fear
will always be

38:25.470 --> 38:27.639
a part of our
collective society.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.685
But you, you won't, sir.

38:31.685 --> 38:34.104
One day they will find
a new idol.

38:34.104 --> 38:35.981
A new, uh, fraud.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.775
Born out of some new means
of mass communication.

38:38.775 --> 38:42.320
But peddling the same old lies.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.740
Of bogeymen.

38:44.740 --> 38:48.493
And dying cultures
and deep states.

38:49.619 --> 38:53.498
And we will counter him...

38:54.624 --> 38:56.543
...too.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.716
No further questions,
Your Honors.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.863
<i>After two days
of deliberation,</i>

39:24.863 --> 39:27.032
<i>the verdict is in.</i>

39:27.032 --> 39:29.117
<i>The world waits nervously
as the justices</i>

39:29.117 --> 39:31.161
<i>will render their decision
this afternoon.</i>

39:43.006 --> 39:45.926
My fellow justices and I
have listened

39:45.926 --> 39:48.887
carefully to the testimony
and arguments

39:48.887 --> 39:51.556
put before the court,
and we have examined

39:51.556 --> 39:54.184
all of the documents
and evidence.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.647
The marshal will produce

39:58.647 --> 40:00.899
the defendant
before the tribunal.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.369
Adolf Hitler...

40:14.121 --> 40:16.164
...on the count
of crimes against peace,

40:16.164 --> 40:18.500
the tribunal finds you...

40:18.500 --> 40:21.211
guilty as charged.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.515
On the count of war crimes:
guilty.

40:33.515 --> 40:37.310
On the count of crimes
against humanity: guilty.

40:37.310 --> 40:39.563
On the count of common plan

40:39.563 --> 40:42.691
or conspiracy
to commit murder... guilty.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.821
Adolf Hitler,

40:47.821 --> 40:50.824
you are hereby sentenced
to lifetime imprisonment

40:50.824 --> 40:53.285
without the possibility
of parole.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.068
<i>Adolf Hitler has
been found guilty on all counts.</i>

42:33.426 --> 42:34.594
Hey, hey, hey...

42:34.594 --> 42:35.679
Okay, let's go.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.097
What's wrong?

42:37.097 --> 42:38.390
Shit!

42:38.390 --> 42:39.432
Medic!

42:39.432 --> 42:41.518
Damnit!

42:41.518 --> 42:43.186
We need an ambulance.

42:44.437 --> 42:47.023
Hey! We need help! Quick!

42:47.023 --> 42:48.566
He's having a heart attack!

42:55.532 --> 42:57.158
They're saying he had
a heart attack!

42:57.158 --> 42:59.244
They're taking him
to a hospital now!

42:59.244 --> 43:00.829
Yes...

43:00.829 --> 43:02.706
Go. We got to go.

43:02.706 --> 43:05.625
We got to go.
He's up to something.

43:28.690 --> 43:31.484
Seven minutes
from Universität München.

43:51.379 --> 43:53.715
Six minutes from
Universität München.

43:53.715 --> 43:55.216
Six minutes away.

43:55.216 --> 43:57.469
When we get to the hospital,
I'll secure his room.

43:57.469 --> 43:58.928
You all take the perimeter.

43:58.928 --> 44:00.722
That's if he's going
to the hospital.

44:00.722 --> 44:03.391
Who has an extra gun for me?

44:03.391 --> 44:04.851
- Me.
- Me.
- Me.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.103
Fucking bunch of Eagle Scouts.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.897
I love it.

44:24.788 --> 44:25.830
- Step on it!
- Go, go, go, go!

44:25.830 --> 44:27.540
They're getting away! Go!

44:29.125 --> 44:30.877
Hang on.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.671
Where are you going?!

44:33.671 --> 44:35.256
The hell are you doing?!

44:35.256 --> 44:37.425
The hospital's that way!

44:37.425 --> 44:38.718
Heil Hitler.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.651
Ten seconds.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.532
Now! Now! Now!

45:03.368 --> 45:04.619
Now!

45:05.412 --> 45:07.580
Hold on!

45:11.835 --> 45:13.795
Joe!

45:50.582 --> 45:52.959
We must hurry, Mein Führer.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.386
Watch your step.

46:10.185 --> 46:12.061
It was about time.

46:12.061 --> 46:13.771
Hello, my love.

46:13.771 --> 46:16.065
And bravo to you.

46:16.065 --> 46:18.193
It was my honor to save him.

46:18.193 --> 46:21.529
Uh, you weren't
quite saving him, though.

46:27.702 --> 46:29.162
What is going on?

46:29.162 --> 46:31.915
What an embarrassment,
what you did in that courtroom.

46:31.915 --> 46:34.000
Broadcast to the whole world.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.877
That lawyer was right.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.795
You looked like

46:37.795 --> 46:41.674
the pathetic, hateful,
unimaginative loon that you are.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.930
No.

46:46.930 --> 46:48.932
Succession starts now,
my darling.

46:48.932 --> 46:50.808
I take the crown.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.352
I lead.

46:52.352 --> 46:54.479
Seeing as you have

46:54.479 --> 46:56.272
allowed yourself
to be captured, though,

46:56.272 --> 46:59.651
we can't risk
disappearing you again.

46:59.651 --> 47:01.402
We kill you here,

47:01.402 --> 47:04.030
burn your body,
and pretend you have

47:04.030 --> 47:06.533
gloriously escaped
to an unknown location.

47:06.533 --> 47:10.161
Never to be seen
or caught again.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.039
There is a problem.

47:14.207 --> 47:16.042
You are not a leader.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.672
I've saved your hide twice now.

47:20.672 --> 47:23.550
I am more of a leader
than you ever were.

47:25.927 --> 47:27.595
Do it!

47:44.487 --> 47:48.283
This cause doesn't respond well
to queens, unfortunately.

47:50.326 --> 47:52.203
But me?

47:52.203 --> 47:54.414
I'm a leader.

47:54.414 --> 47:56.749
I'm the future.

47:59.627 --> 48:01.963
It's time to go.

48:01.963 --> 48:04.215
What do you want?

48:04.215 --> 48:07.135
I want you to anoint me.

48:07.135 --> 48:10.471
People like
a clear line of succession.

48:11.514 --> 48:15.560
I amassed an army
while I was in prison. Come on.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.646
These are men who know
how to fight, to kill.

48:18.646 --> 48:20.982
I can lead them.

48:20.982 --> 48:22.567
They're getting us out of here.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.944
A helicopter's on its way.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.948
Get down! Down!

48:51.596 --> 48:56.017
Travis! Where are you?!

49:15.662 --> 49:18.206
Look at me. Look at me!

49:24.545 --> 49:25.922
Jonah!

49:29.008 --> 49:31.010
Put your fucking guns down! Now!

49:32.136 --> 49:33.388
On the ground!

49:33.388 --> 49:35.848
Get on the fucking ground!

49:35.848 --> 49:38.226
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

49:38.226 --> 49:40.311
You got to breathe, Jonah.
Hold on.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.636
Get me that fucking ambulance!

50:13.636 --> 50:17.306
Get me an ambulance now!

50:56.971 --> 50:59.599
The real her, you know?

50:59.599 --> 51:02.560
You know the real her, Jonah.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.896
- No. No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes.

51:04.896 --> 51:06.856
Not the...

51:06.856 --> 51:09.484
one who hunted Nazis.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.737
Not the vigilante.

51:14.822 --> 51:16.949
Not the woman
before everything happened.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.868
But you.

51:18.868 --> 51:21.621
You knew all those parts of her.

51:21.621 --> 51:25.166
Well, Jonah, I've been
on this Earth many years.

51:25.166 --> 51:28.628
You know, I have seen
the dimensions of human beings.

51:28.628 --> 51:30.588
I've known the doubles

51:30.588 --> 51:32.423
and the doppelgängers.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.634
Angels and monsters, both.

51:36.511 --> 51:38.513
But above all else...

51:42.600 --> 51:45.102
...there's one true self.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.688
Each of us chooses

51:47.688 --> 51:50.066
who we show that self to.

51:50.066 --> 51:52.276
And Ruth...

51:52.276 --> 51:54.362
chose you.

51:55.738 --> 51:58.574
Only you, Jonah...

51:58.574 --> 52:01.202
saw the real her.

52:01.202 --> 52:03.162
The way she looked at the moon

52:03.162 --> 52:05.122
like it was her friend

52:05.122 --> 52:07.250
who abandoned her
all those years ago.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.462
She always feared that...

52:11.462 --> 52:13.881
she would forget
her mother's face.

52:13.881 --> 52:17.343
I remember she wished
she was not only known

52:17.343 --> 52:18.803
as a survivor.

52:18.803 --> 52:22.431
But she was grateful that,
that-that she did.

52:22.431 --> 52:23.724
She was always grateful.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.643
- Mm.
- So much more to her.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.728
She...

52:27.728 --> 52:30.147
Every time she laughed,
she would wink.

52:30.147 --> 52:32.775
She also loved to wish

52:32.775 --> 52:35.069
on eyelashes.

52:35.069 --> 52:36.946
She loved that.

52:36.946 --> 52:38.823
How wonderful

52:38.823 --> 52:41.576
and liberating for her...

52:41.576 --> 52:43.995
that she had you.

52:43.995 --> 52:47.248
She had you to be there.

52:48.708 --> 52:51.168
And be seen by.

52:51.168 --> 52:53.629
The way you saw her...

52:54.922 --> 52:56.799
As a human being.

52:56.799 --> 52:59.010
And isn't that what we all want?

52:59.010 --> 53:00.720
Hmm?

53:00.720 --> 53:03.389
That think as we may...

53:03.389 --> 53:05.808
otherwise...

53:05.808 --> 53:08.060
maybe that's our real need.

53:10.187 --> 53:13.441
Our reward for being
in this absurd life.

53:13.441 --> 53:15.526
To be seen.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.238
How simple.

53:20.615 --> 53:22.617
What else is there...

53:24.076 --> 53:26.287
...than being seen?

53:59.195 --> 54:02.573
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:09.872 --> 54:11.874
I'm sorry.

Day my <i>safta</i> was killed?

1:00:27.499 --> 1:00:30.044
At 9:17 p.m.,
just a couple of hours

1:00:30.044 --> 1:00:31.754
before Ruth was murdered,

1:00:31.754 --> 1:00:33.547
a call came into the toy shop

1:00:33.547 --> 1:00:37.468
from 212-073-4309.

1:00:38.510 --> 1:00:40.637
The number that belonged
to the residence of...

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:42.723
Meyer Offerman.

1:00:47.728 --> 1:00:50.439
Meyer called Richter.

1:00:52.316 --> 1:00:54.610
Meyer gave the order.

1:01:05.788 --> 1:01:08.957
My deepest sorrows
about your grandmother.

1:01:11.794 --> 1:01:14.922
Ruth had discovered
Meyer was The Wolf.

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:18.175
She figured it out.

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:21.011
But before she could act...

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:22.221
he got to her.

1:01:23.972 --> 1:01:26.850
Evil doesn't rest, Jonah.

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:29.269
Evil doesn't retire.

1:01:30.938 --> 1:01:32.356
So why should we?

1:01:33.482 --> 1:01:34.858
How can we?

1:01:34.858 --> 1:01:38.278
We tell the stories of the past
to change our future.

1:01:39.613 --> 1:01:42.533
Anyway, do give my best
to Clara. Hmm.

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:46.245
Wishing you both the happiest
of ever fucking afters.

1:01:58.382 --> 1:02:00.884
<i>Miami was a nice little
surprise for a honeymoon.</i>

1:02:00.884 --> 1:02:04.221
You know, I thought
it'd be a good change of pace.

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:23.615
What?

1:02:23.615 --> 1:02:26.201
I see them in you.

1:02:27.494 --> 1:02:29.746
Your <i>safta.</i> Chava.

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:35.043
I see you.

1:02:36.044 --> 1:02:38.464
And I love what I see.

1:02:45.596 --> 1:02:47.097
To new beginnings.

1:02:48.932 --> 1:02:50.517
<i>L'chaim.</i>

1:03:05.991 --> 1:03:08.202
- Here you are, sir.
- <i>Danke.</i>
