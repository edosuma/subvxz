-What can I do for you, Officer?
-Know why I pulled you over?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.996
Yes, I wasn't paying
enough attention to the road,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.040
and I apologize.
I've got a lot on my mind.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.458
This is…

01:23.541 --> 01:24.876
my last night in LA.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.252
Wait.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.172
I know you.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.008
Probably. I used to work for the LAPD.

01:32.092 --> 01:32.926
Is that right?

01:33.009 --> 01:37.222
Oh, yes. Crime-solving devil.
It was great fun, but that's over now.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.349
-Since the war.
-You were in the sandbox?

01:39.432 --> 01:42.060
Uh. More of a football stadium.
A month ago.

01:42.143 --> 01:45.522
Fought against my brother and his host
of angels for the throne of Heaven.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.273
-It was all very biblical.
-Did you win?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.901
Well, I won, but not without
having to fly to the Silver City

01:49.984 --> 01:51.611
to save my girlfriend, burn up,

01:51.694 --> 01:54.072
prove to myself I was worthy,
stop burning and--

01:54.155 --> 01:57.075
Yeah, anyway,
long story short, now I'm the Big Man.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.829
So, I just pulled over God?

02:00.912 --> 02:04.457
Well, not quite. I still have to ascend
to the Silver City and sit on the throne.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.708
I do that tomorrow.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.002
Hold on a minute.

02:08.503 --> 02:13.091
I do know you. You're the officer
who likes to drive fast with his siren on.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.219
[chuckles] Yeah, I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me.

02:16.302 --> 02:20.306
Ho-ho-ho! Man, I am so glad I'm running
into you again. I have to thank you.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.143
I hope you bought yourself something
pretty with that money I gave you.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.686
Oh, I sure did.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.480
Got that sweet foxtail
for my bike antenna right there.

02:27.564 --> 02:31.276
I got that and, uh,
like, a ton of cocaine.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.193
Oh.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.488
Yeah. Oh, man, it is liberating.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.824
Chasing my desires
like that changed my life.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.909
Marvelous.
Well, that's the kind of personal touch

02:39.993 --> 02:42.120
I hope to be scaling up
as ruler of the universe.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.037
Yeah.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.958
Well, it wasn't all good.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.252
You know,
I, uh, I got in trouble at work a lot,

02:49.335 --> 02:52.589
so I will be riding that bike
for the rest of my career.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.340
And my wife left me.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.051
She took the house.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.346
You know?
But my new house is a boat! Yeah.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.224
A lot of great characters
down by the marina. Whoo!

03:03.308 --> 03:05.310
Man, do they like to drink. [sighs]

03:05.393 --> 03:06.644
Do they?

03:06.728 --> 03:09.355
Anyways, I am so glad
that I got to thank you.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.816
Well, you are more than welcome.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.068
Hey.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.323
You got any more
of that money, like last time?

03:20.783 --> 03:21.784
Oh.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.853
[laughs]
Still not used to you calling me that.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.272
-Well, don't you like it?
-No, I love it.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.650
[chuckles] Shall we?

03:53.733 --> 03:54.609
Yeah.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.986
Can't wait to show you this.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.905
[Chloe laughs] Can't wait to see it.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.123
[men and women clamoring, applauding]

04:13.461 --> 04:17.674
Believe it or not, this is the world's
only private club for magicians.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.260
Apart from the one
that I started with Rasputin.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.220
The Romanovs were furious.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.304
Yeah, Dai Vernon.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.056
-Do you know who Dai Vernon is?
-Mnh-mnh.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.058
-The Professor. Doesn't matter.
-Mm.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.435
Dai Vernon challenged
a young David Copperfield

04:29.519 --> 04:32.397
to a drinking contest
at that bar right there.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.983
-[laughing]
-[Lucifer sighs]

04:35.066 --> 04:37.360

04:37.443 --> 04:39.362
Really? Who won?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.364
Well, me, of course. Couldn't help myself.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.533
[hesitates] Oh, my gosh.
I don't believe it.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.160
-Look, over there in the corner.
-Hmm.

04:46.244 --> 04:50.331
[Lucifer] That is Jon Armstrong, one of
the greatest card magicians in the world.

04:50.873 --> 04:51.958
-Oh.
-This way.

04:52.917 --> 04:56.838
Oh! Uh, be on
the lookout for secret passages.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.881
-Shh!
-[both chuckle]

04:58.965 --> 05:01.134
You know,
I've always wanted to come here.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.261
-And you do look amazing.
-Thank you.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.179
You know, magic for our last night?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.473
Well, what could be
more magical than magic?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.851
I don't know.
Isn't magic just a little goofy?

05:09.934 --> 05:13.813
Goofy? It's skill, cunning and deception
without telling a lie. What's not to love?

05:13.896 --> 05:17.025
-[man] Coming through.
-[laughing] Oh, hello.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.485
So, like, everywhere you look,
there's a puzzle to solve.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.612
-No, we're not gonna solve anything.
-Oh!

05:21.696 --> 05:24.949
When you know how the tricks work,
it ruins everything. Thank you, Bones.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.951
-Have you lost weight? [chuckles]
-[Bones cackles]

05:27.035 --> 05:28.328
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.038
I mean, Lucifer, you really expect me

05:30.121 --> 05:32.081
to hang out here all night
surrounded by mysteries

05:32.165 --> 05:34.292
and not try to figure out
how everything works?

05:34.375 --> 05:38.171
Chloe, you are a truth-seeker.
That's what made you a great detective.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.089
But me, I'm a wonder-seeker.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.632
You seek wonder?

05:41.716 --> 05:45.386
Well, also drugs, debauchery and now
certain extinct whiskeys but yes,

05:45.470 --> 05:48.348
so tonight you are just gonna have
to enjoy the wonder with me. Cheers.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.891
[Chloe] Hmm. Oh.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.227
-So I understand, tomorrow…
-Mm.

05:53.895 --> 05:57.565
…you'll become God and then
know how everything works, right?

05:59.776 --> 06:02.070
No, I think it's very sweet

06:02.153 --> 06:06.157
that you wanna spend with me
your last night of wonder.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.409
[chuckles] Right, yes. About that.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.453
I was thinking on the drive over,

06:10.536 --> 06:12.872
do we really need to start tomorrow?

06:12.955 --> 06:15.124
[chuckles]
I mean, we're having so much fun.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.627
Grandma Penelope's heart's
grown three times the size

06:17.710 --> 06:19.253
thanks to her time with Trixie.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.464
Why don't we
just extend our vacation a little longer?

06:21.547 --> 06:25.301
Well, I mean, yes,
we're having fun, and it's been great,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.303
but you've already
pushed the coronation once.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.514
And I mean,
don't we have to get up there?

06:29.597 --> 06:34.352
Well, eventually. It's not like the sky's
gonna fall in on itself or anything.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.645
-[bell ringing]
-Are you sure?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.730
-Because I feel like if we--
-Mm! Mm-mm-mm.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.440
Hold that thought. It's starting.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.776
-Come on.
-[audience applauding]

06:42.360 --> 06:44.612
[Lucifer] This is why we are here tonight.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.657
The final show
of Magnar the Magnificent. [chuckles]

06:47.740 --> 06:49.992
This guy.
His act looks like a hundred years old.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.036
One hundred and twenty, to be precise.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.289
The first Magnar created one of
the most flawless acts in all of magic,

06:55.373 --> 06:57.166
then he handed
the mantle down to his protégé.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.503
And it's been handed down ever since,
and tonight in a super-exclusive show--

07:00.586 --> 07:03.005
It's being handed down again.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.299
-You just can't help yourself, can you?
-[laughs]

07:05.383 --> 07:07.260
[woman] Mr. Morningstar!

07:07.343 --> 07:08.594
Right this way.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.472
Oh. Cannot wait.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.390
Thank you.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.725
And for this…

07:16.436 --> 07:21.357
my final act on stage…

07:21.441 --> 07:23.818
[audience gasps]

07:26.654 --> 07:29.073
…I will literally conquer death

07:29.866 --> 07:33.870
and emerge resurrected!

-Hmm.

[gasping continues]

08:04.192 --> 08:05.902
[laughing]

08:05.985 --> 08:09.322
So, obviously, there must be some
mechanism in the box so that it--

08:09.405 --> 08:13.326
Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Chloe, please!
We're not solving any mysteries tonight.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.538
Oh! [laughs]

08:26.005 --> 08:27.632
Resurrection!

08:28.382 --> 08:29.258
[Lucifer gasps]

08:32.094 --> 08:33.804
[audience gasps]

08:35.723 --> 08:38.684
Oh! [laughs]

08:38.768 --> 08:40.311
He's good, isn't he?

08:53.658 --> 08:57.828
All right, everybody, just…
stay calm and try not to touch anything.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.207
This is an active crime scene now.
We have everything under control.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.542
Poor Magnar.

09:03.334 --> 09:07.046
Still, at least he died knowing
his illusion was never revealed.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.215
-[knocking]
-Do you hear that?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.050
Is that coming from inside the box?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.343
-[pounding]
-[muffled shout]

09:12.426 --> 09:14.011
You said not to touch anything.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.972
What? No, open it.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.683
[pounding, muffled shouting continue]

09:23.813 --> 09:26.774
What the hell is going on?

09:26.857 --> 09:29.360
Magnar! He's done it again!

09:29.443 --> 09:31.779
Erika, how could you miss your cue?

09:31.862 --> 09:34.949
But if he's alive there, then who's that?

09:38.035 --> 09:39.370
Oh, God.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.249
Jared Holbrook.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.003
My protégé.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.839
So, this is how the trick is performed?

09:49.922 --> 09:53.467
You stay hidden in the box,
and then he emerges here dressed as you

09:53.551 --> 09:54.552
and takes your bow?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.555
[Magnar]
Yes, he's hidden in there the entire time.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.640
-We show the audience it's empty.
-[Lucifer humming]

09:59.724 --> 10:05.104
Uh, the interior is actually painted
to give a false sense of depth.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.230
[continues humming]

10:06.314 --> 10:07.815
Are you all right, my boy?

10:07.898 --> 10:10.484
He just does not like to hear
how the tricks are performed.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.236
No, I most certainly do not,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.865
but I'm sure that there's more
that I remain blissfully unaware of.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.242
-No, that's pretty much it.
-Oh.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.786
So do you know of anyone
who would wanna hurt Jared

10:20.870 --> 10:22.830
-or anyone who was angry with him?
-[man] Whoa!

10:23.497 --> 10:25.207
Don't say anything else, Dad.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.127
I'm a lawyer. My father doesn't
have to answer any of these questions.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.421
Alan, you're an entertainment lawyer.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.381
Not now, Dad.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.636
Well, no worries there because we're
not actually the police, right, Chloe?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.681
No. Currently, no, we're not.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.685
Well, then I'd appreciate my dad
not being harassed with questions

10:44.769 --> 10:46.354
until the cops do arrive.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.732
-[door opens]
-[Ella shouts] I can't believe it!

10:49.815 --> 10:52.818
Six weeks of dragging my bag

10:52.902 --> 10:55.988
to Lucifer-and-Chloe-less
crime scenes and now, boom!

10:56.072 --> 11:00.368
You guys are witnesses.
Oh, this is so amazing! I mean, hmm…

11:00.451 --> 11:02.745
Horrible way to end a date and, you know,

11:02.828 --> 11:06.207
horrible for the dead guy,
but not horrible for me.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.125
Or does that sound horrible?

11:08.209 --> 11:09.919
It's nice to see you too, Miss Lopez.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.964
Aww, it must be weird being
on the other side of things for once, huh?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.300
-[Lucifer] Hmm.
-Takes a little getting used to.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.885
-Yeah, that's for sure.
-[huffs]

11:17.968 --> 11:19.637
So how are things going with, um, Carol?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.431
Good. I mean, he's no you guys, but--

11:22.515 --> 11:26.185
Miss Decker, Mr. Morningstar,
it's funny to see you here. [chuckles]

11:26.268 --> 11:29.522
Good to see you
and no need to be so formal.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.524
Any friend of Dan's is…

11:32.149 --> 11:33.067
you know.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.404
I'm glad you could transfer in.
The department's in good hands.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.824
Yeah, I mean I have big shoes to fill,
Dan's and yours.

11:39.907 --> 11:43.369
But thank you so much for securing
the crime scene, keeping everybody calm.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.706
Not sure I even have to work this case,
between you and Ella. [chuckles]

11:46.789 --> 11:48.791
[Lucifer chuckles] Lucky for us you do,

11:48.874 --> 11:51.168
which means Chloe doesn't
have to be a detective anymore,

11:51.252 --> 11:53.713
I don't have to have
magic ruined for the rest of my life,

11:53.796 --> 11:56.841
and we can still make the 8:30 show
in the parlor, so if you don't mind…

11:56.924 --> 11:59.760
You know,
I bet we probably have to hang here

11:59.844 --> 12:02.513
because we were witnesses
to the murder, right, Carol?

12:02.596 --> 12:05.057
[Carol] Yeah, unfortunately she's correct.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.768
I'm gonna have to get your statement
before you can be released.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.895
That's fantastic news.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.732
[sighs deeply]

12:13.566 --> 12:17.987
♪ Mug after mug of alcoholic substance… ♪

12:18.070 --> 12:22.324
All right, so who wants
to be tickled by Satan's Whiskers?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.701
-[Mazikeen] Ooh!
-[laughing]

12:23.784 --> 12:26.579
[Linda] There were no
"Queen of Hell" themed cocktails.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.997
Couldn't find the right pun.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.542
That's okay. I've been
tickled by those whiskers before.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.501
Me too.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.920
[laughing]

12:35.004 --> 12:36.964
Well, you two are made
for each other, aren't you?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.383
Oh, yeah. Cheers, you guys.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.427
-[Linda] Oh.
-Cheers.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.971
Wow, you really went all out, Linda.

12:44.054 --> 12:48.267
Yeah, well, it's not every day that
my best friend and her girlfriend

12:48.350 --> 12:50.936
-depart this mortal plane to rule Hell.
-[Eve] Mm.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.023
So, Eve,
have you, um, ever actually been there?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.608
Mnh-mnh, I have not.

12:55.691 --> 12:59.028
But what an amazing adventure, huh?

12:59.111 --> 13:04.909
From Heaven to Hell
and everywhere in between. [laughs]

13:04.992 --> 13:08.621
And this time,
I'll have the best partner with me.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.042
[Amenadiel]
Are you ready to leave tomorrow?

13:13.125 --> 13:17.171
I mean, I'll be free to fly you down
right after Lucifer's coronation.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.173
Hell, yeah, I'm ready.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.884
My Maziqueen's gonna to rule that throne.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.386
I'm gonna make you proud.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.971
Subjugating scum,

13:26.055 --> 13:29.058
grinding my siblings
under my boot. [chuckles]

13:29.141 --> 13:31.018
[Eve moans]

13:31.936 --> 13:34.563
So, Eve, have, um,
you given any thought

13:34.647 --> 13:37.775
as to, uh, what you'll
be doing while Maze is ruling?

13:37.858 --> 13:41.821
[exhales] I'm gonna
support my girl in all her work.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.616
She's gonna be the greatest queen ever.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.700
[Mazikeen chuckles]

13:47.284 --> 13:50.120
That's great, but what
will that actually look like for you?

13:50.204 --> 13:53.749
Will you also be "subjugating scum"?

13:55.626 --> 13:59.129
[chuckles] I don't know, I mean…

13:59.213 --> 14:01.799
I'll figure it out when we get there.

14:01.882 --> 14:02.716
Yeah.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.803
-Huh. Okay. Uh…
-[Mazikeen and Eve laugh]

14:05.886 --> 14:09.932
Okay, well, it's time for appetizers.
I made deviled eggs.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.351
-[Eve] Ooh, yeah!
-Let's do that. [chuckles]

14:18.983 --> 14:20.359
[camera shutter clicks]

14:20.442 --> 14:23.404
Miss Lopez,
when do you think we'll be wrapping up?

14:24.029 --> 14:26.031
[sighs] I'm not sure.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.449
I spoke with Magnar,

14:27.533 --> 14:30.953
and he explained that
for this particular illusion,

14:31.036 --> 14:33.956
only one
of the dueling sabers is actually sharp,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.584
the one they use
to cut the apple with on stage.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.336
-But this one was also sharp.
-[exhales]

14:39.420 --> 14:42.798
Which means the killer prepared it,
totally premeditated.

14:42.882 --> 14:47.303
Oh. Right, sorry, old habits.
Not your problem anymore.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.472
No, now my problem is
I know about fake dueling sabers.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.558
I need this over and done with
as quickly as possible

14:52.641 --> 14:54.977
so Chloe and I can continue
our wonder-seeking date.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.981
You guys are absolutely adorbs.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.358
I really do miss you.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.111
Family business, I get it.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.030
You're in my prayers.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.450
For what that's worth.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.077
What do you mean, for what that's worth?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.622
I thought that was worth
a lot to you, Miss Lopez.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.415
Another crisis of faith?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.501
Oh, no, that-- that was so two years ago.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.046
I-- I definitely still believe.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.297
It's just…

15:24.381 --> 15:25.799
[sighs]

15:25.883 --> 15:29.637
Uh, okay,
this might sound absolutely crazy,

15:29.720 --> 15:34.725
but lately, I've been praying a lot,

15:35.726 --> 15:38.812
and it feels like nobody's listening.

15:39.396 --> 15:43.359
Like the Big Guy's
just not there or something.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.695
I know. It's so dodo-headed.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.949
[chuckles] I mean, like, as if that
could really happen, right? No way!

15:50.032 --> 15:53.327
-[laughs] Yes. That would be dodo-headed.
-[camera shutter clicks]

15:55.162 --> 15:58.791
So the act has
a live chicken and a live butterfly.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.960
This is all very helpful.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.629
[Chloe sighs]

16:06.131 --> 16:08.717
Hey, I haven't seen you
around here before.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.344
I'm Keaton Call.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.181
You probably know me
from my Instagram account, BroMagic69.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.643
-I don't.
-Well, four million other people do.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.688
Hey, if you wanna see the future of magic,
check out my profile.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.189
-Okay.
-Hmm.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.066
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.277
You know, if Magnar had made me
his apprentice would still be alive.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.490
Not saying that
my work saves lives, but… [laughs]

16:31.573 --> 16:32.992
So you know Magnar?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.618
-Hmm.
-Huh?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.412
I was his apprentice before Jared.

16:37.079 --> 16:37.913
Yeah.

16:38.622 --> 16:39.498
Damn, Jared.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.210
That could've been me getting stabbed,
if I hadn't discovered social media.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.422
My problem is I'm an innovator.
I see the future.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.590
All these other old fogies,
they're stuck in the past.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.386
Meanwhile, my phone is blowing up.
AGT, Vegas.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.639
[chuckles] Magnar's climbing
in the coffins. I'm on a rocket. Yeah.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.559
Wow, Magnar must be
really jealous of all your success.

16:58.642 --> 17:02.896
You walking away and blowing up
while he stays a small, insider act.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.149
Magnar, nah. He--

17:05.232 --> 17:08.318
Look, a lot of people
are jealous of me, of course.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.029
Are you kidding me? [laughs]

17:10.112 --> 17:12.239
Not Magnar. Magnar's a sweet old man.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.991
-Me and him are still tight.
-Hmm.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.118
At his pre-show ritual with him tonight,

17:16.201 --> 17:18.954
we had a Magnar Mai Tai, the usual.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.497
-[laughs]
-Oh.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.041
So you saw him arrive?

17:22.624 --> 17:25.127
How close to showtime
does he have that drink?

17:25.210 --> 17:30.591
He goes from the car
to the bar stool to the curtain.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.468
Always has.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.845
Hey, I really dig
how into talking to me you are.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.389
It kind of feels like
we're already dating.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.516
I mean, we're already accessorizing alike.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.434
What?

17:48.108 --> 17:49.359
Have a good night.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.111
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.238
-Uh, can I talk to you a second?
-Uh, sure, yes.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.990
Uh, can you excuse me for just a moment?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.117
What's up? Everything okay?

17:57.201 --> 18:00.746
Yeah, yeah, so I think I have an alibi
for Magnar. Another magician was with him

18:00.829 --> 18:03.207
from the time he got here
until the start of the show.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.917
You really need to talk to him and see if…

18:06.877 --> 18:08.295
Did you already talk to him?

18:08.879 --> 18:11.673
I'm so sorry.
You're a good detective, just ignore me.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.925
-I'm pretty okay.
-Mm-hmm.

18:13.008 --> 18:16.178
Listen,
I appreciate the help. I really do.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.014
-But you don't have to stay. Okay?
-[Lucifer sighs]

18:19.098 --> 18:21.600
Don't let this ruin your night.
Everything is under control.

18:21.683 --> 18:25.062
That is good news. I'm sure it's
in very capable hands, Detective…

18:25.145 --> 18:26.230
you.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.774
So, shall we, Chloe? [chuckles]

18:28.857 --> 18:30.234
-[Chloe] Yeah.
-[Ella] Hold up.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.445
I just confirmed. Jared was killed
sometime in the last two hours.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.117
And no one's left since then.
So you should keep holding everybody.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.120
-And that door's the only way out.
-Well, except for the secret passages.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.455
No, that is a myth. We talked to everyone.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.250
Which means
the killer is still in the building.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.502
Locked room mystery, you guys.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.256
So, who's up for an all-nighter?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.927
-[clears throat]
-[gasps]

19:02.850 --> 19:04.977
Jared was about to inherit,
from what I understand,

19:05.060 --> 19:07.813
is a pretty legendary role in magic.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.439
Did that create any jealousy?

19:10.274 --> 19:11.567
Jealousy?

19:11.650 --> 19:15.279
What, of Jared? Are you kidding?
It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

19:16.363 --> 19:20.742
And your relationship with him,
would you say it was free of conflict?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.871
Mm-hmm. Jared was a great collaborator.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.915
He was talking about
helping me develop my own stage show.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.668
I've heard Jared described
as "well-liked." Would you agree?

19:29.751 --> 19:32.379
Jared wasn't just well-liked,
he was respected.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.631
Hell, even I can't deny the guy had chops.

19:34.715 --> 19:39.553
I've heard he was set to cash in
on some big Netflix series about Magnar.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.430
And this is your first time here?

19:41.513 --> 19:43.223
First time. Yes, yes.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.101
[gasps] Wait.
Is there anyone else new here?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.019
Is that a clue?

19:47.102 --> 19:51.273
No, not that it's my place
to, um, ask anymore, but is it?

19:51.356 --> 19:56.195
So let's just start with what you were
doing before the event this evening.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.321
Oh, that's easy.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.573
I was bribing a motorcycle cop.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.034
You were bribing a police officer?

20:02.117 --> 20:03.827
Indeed. Not for the first time.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.372
If you ask him, I'm sure he'll
corroborate. He's a bit of an over-sharer.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.001
And up until recently,
you consulted for the LAPD?

20:11.084 --> 20:13.212
-Mm-hmm.
-You also claim that you're the Devil?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.296
Was the Devil.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.215
God now. Well, nearly.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.426
Tonight's event was a pretty intimate one.
How did you get an invite?

20:19.509 --> 20:21.720
I've been a member here
since it first opened. [chuckles]

20:21.803 --> 20:22.721
In 1963.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.264
Sounds about right.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.016
And how old would you say you are again?

20:26.099 --> 20:29.019
Well, time works
very differently in Hell, so…

20:29.686 --> 20:31.188
probably have to go with ageless.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.358
He's just sensitive about his age.
Even I don't know the real number.

20:34.441 --> 20:38.445
And just out of curiosity,
um, how are you with swords?

20:38.528 --> 20:40.197
Oh, a bit rusty.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.575
Although I did recently
defeat a Yakuza boss in a duel.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.036
And I did stab a man
through the heart once.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.788
Well, that is quite the coincidence.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.873
'Cause that is exactly
how Jared was killed.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.250
Fascinating.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.377
Though I used a demon blade,
this was a sword.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.212
So not really relevant, I suppose.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.048
It was all very complicated.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.008
Best not to dwell.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.594
♪ Bring out the Devil in me ♪

21:02.678 --> 21:04.763
Hey. What did you say in there?

21:05.764 --> 21:07.975
The truth. It's what
I always tell everyone. [chuckles]

21:08.058 --> 21:09.434
I know, and I love you for that,

21:09.518 --> 21:12.562
but because of what you said to Carol,
that you're his number one suspect now.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.064
What? That's absurd.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.066
I'd never kill a magician.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.152
I mean, a mentalist maybe,
but not an artist like Jared.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.737
Well, I know that, and you know that,

21:20.821 --> 21:22.281
but Carol, he's by the book.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.032
He's not gonna let you off
on my word alone,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.410
so I really think there's
only one thing we can do.

21:27.327 --> 21:31.164
Go home, have sex, fall asleep
and never think about him again? [laughs]

21:31.248 --> 21:34.167
No, solve this case on our own.

21:34.876 --> 21:35.711
What?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.005
[Carol] Your alibi checked out.

21:38.588 --> 21:42.092
Yeah, motorcycle cop called
and confirmed your story.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.343
[Lucifer] Ah.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.970
-Really?
-[Carol] Yeah.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.889
I mean, he's been suspended now,
but you're no longer a suspect.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.934
Well, that's-- that's great.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.855
Carol, I just got
some really juicy gossip.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.690
-Well, it's actually a clue.
-Hmm.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.818
God, isn't it just so interesting how
there's always so much insider-y drama,

21:59.901 --> 22:01.111
no matter what the industry?

22:01.194 --> 22:05.032
-Even the toy industry, they have spies.
-Toy industry. Give us one second, please.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.783
-Ella. What's the clue?
-Oh.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.493
Right, so,

22:08.577 --> 22:11.830
the club books rooms in their hotel
for its acts when they come perform.

22:11.913 --> 22:12.748
[Carol] Right.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.168
But assistant Erika
didn't get booked in her own room.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.085
-And…
-Really?

22:17.169 --> 22:21.340
…when victim Jared ordered room service,
it was charged on Erika's…

22:21.423 --> 22:23.050
-Her credit card.
-…credit card.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.094
So they're having an affair
that she didn't disclose to me.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.347
-May be time to talk to her again.
-Think so.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.765
-Thank you.
-Sure.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.311
Wow.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.522
This is just fantastic.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.525
I mean, look at this,
everything is so elaborate,

22:40.609 --> 22:45.072
and it actually got me thinking. [sighs]

22:45.155 --> 22:47.783
This is what I'm going to do.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.994
[chuckles] What?
Go way too hard on food puns?

22:51.078 --> 22:53.288
No. Dinner parties.

22:53.372 --> 22:57.584
Just parties of all kinds.
You know, like I did in the Silver City.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.796
You could rule Hell,
and I could run the social calendar.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.757
I can meet everyone,
and I can, you know,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.343
just, um, bring in all the happiness

23:06.426 --> 23:08.303
and fun and good times.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.933
-You know. [snapping fingers]
-Hell could definitely use some of that.

23:13.016 --> 23:13.850
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:13.934 --> 23:17.187
Honey, who are you going to bring fun to?

23:17.270 --> 23:19.606
The tortured, damned souls?

23:19.689 --> 23:20.899
Uh, yeah.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.611
[Linda] Well, it's not
just damned souls, right?

23:24.694 --> 23:26.613
It's your siblings too, Maze.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.157
That's right.
That's right, thank you, Linda.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.202
I get to hang out
with your family. Amazing!

23:32.285 --> 23:35.705
Yeah. No. They're walking-talking garbage.
I'm keeping you far away from them.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.502
[Eve] So…

23:41.753 --> 23:46.258
just so I'm clear, what is it
that you picture me doing exactly?

23:46.341 --> 23:49.261
Just cleaning and cooking for just you?

23:49.344 --> 23:52.597
'Cause that sounds
incredibly lonely, Maze.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.349
[Mazikeen] I'm not enough for you?

23:54.433 --> 23:58.270
Not at all. Don't twist my words.
You always do this when you're angry.

23:58.353 --> 24:02.065
[Mazikeen] You're telling me I make you
feel lonely! I mean, how twisted is that?

24:02.149 --> 24:03.650
I'm joining the police force!

24:05.569 --> 24:07.028
-What?
-[Amenadiel] Yeah.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.991
I've been in the police academy
for a while now, and it's, uh, going well.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.410
Dan's parting gift.
He put the application in for me.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.620
That's great.
But we should get back to Maze--

24:15.704 --> 24:17.414
[Mazikeen] Why the hell
didn't you tell me?

24:17.497 --> 24:20.041
I guess I just wanted to see how,

24:20.125 --> 24:22.169
you know,
everything was gonna work out first,

24:22.252 --> 24:25.964
and-- and honestly, I thought that you
would do nothing but make fun of me.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.048
Oh, I will.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.135
This is the greatest gift
you have ever given me.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.178
[softly] Thank you.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.471
-[sighs]
-You're welcome.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.474
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.726
Go ahead. Tell us all about the academy.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.312
-[Mazikeen] Mm-hmm.
-[Amenadiel] Oh, well…

24:44.357 --> 24:46.067
Erika, I'm a little confused.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.030
You neglected to tell me that you
were in a relationship with the victim.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.326
Well, it's not that confusing. I didn't
tell you because it makes me look bad.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.787
Why would it make you look bad?
Everyone I talked to loved Jared.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.706
Yeah. Right.

24:59.789 --> 25:00.957
Mr. Popular?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.501
With the guys, maybe.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.546
I don't know if you know this,
but magic is a huge boys' club.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.882
I really thought Jared was different.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.134
I thought he saw my talent.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.469
He made you promises, didn't he?

25:13.053 --> 25:16.097
Jared told me that
he would produce my solo act.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.808
But once Magnar
made the decision to retire,

25:19.601 --> 25:22.145
suddenly Jared wasn't
talking about my career anymore.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.648
And that is why you thought
it would make you look bad.

25:24.731 --> 25:29.194
Angry sidepiece, tossed away
as soon as the dead guy hits it big.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.030
You're gonna tell me
that doesn't look bad?

25:35.909 --> 25:38.161
-What are you doing?
-[gasps]

25:38.787 --> 25:39.913
He thinks it's her.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.374
I hope it bloody is
so we can finally get on with our date.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.252
No, something isn't adding up.
I can feel it in my gut.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.671
Well, maybe your gut
hasn't been receiving its emails,

25:47.754 --> 25:50.215
but the rest of you is retired.
This is Carl's job now.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.174
Carol.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.300
-What?
-Carol.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.927
Really? Ew.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.679
Lucifer, he's got the wrong person.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.598
We have to solve this,
or an innocent woman might go to jail.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.643
Oh.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.733
Ella, did we get
any physical evidence off the body?

26:08.817 --> 26:11.820
Oh, actually,
I can't really get into that right now.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.906
Ugh, Decker, this is killing me,
but you're not on the team anymore.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.700
Miss Lopez makes an excellent point.

26:16.783 --> 26:20.704
We are here seeking wonder, not truth.
Remember? Uh-- Ooh!

26:20.787 --> 26:24.332
Look, that man just pulled
a card out of nowhere. Wondrous.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.167
Oh, did you check the victim's clothing

26:26.251 --> 26:28.295
for any secret compartments,
pockets, anything?

26:28.378 --> 26:32.173
Right, because it's not just about
checking for normal dead-guy stuff.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.843
It's about checking
for magician dead-guy stuff.

26:34.926 --> 26:38.763
Oh, man, I could totally do a panel
on this at the next Forensicon. Brilliant!

26:38.847 --> 26:40.181
[Chloe] Nice.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.475
You're really helping
with this investigation, aren't you?

26:42.559 --> 26:44.936
Well, it's like you said.
I'm a truth-seeker.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.564
Chloe, I know you miss being a detective,

26:47.647 --> 26:49.649
but we're at a different stage
of our lives now.

26:49.733 --> 26:53.445
Well, are we? I mean, you just told me
that you've delayed the next stage again.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.739
Look, this isn't easy on me either.

26:56.698 --> 27:00.827
I'm starting a new day job, in Heaven,
and the commute daily, alone.

27:00.910 --> 27:01.786
Understood.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.997
Right, and all I'm trying to say is that

27:04.080 --> 27:07.375
I just think that there might be some
deeper reasons behind these excuses

27:07.459 --> 27:09.419
and that maybe we should talk about them.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.047
-'Cause you can't put this off forever.
-[Ella] Bingo!

27:12.631 --> 27:13.590
-Sort of.
-[clicks]

27:13.673 --> 27:14.591
I found a bead.

27:14.674 --> 27:18.637
Tucked up in a secret pocket,
like you said, up in his sleeve.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.765
But Magnar's costume
doesn't have any beadwork on it,

27:21.848 --> 27:23.767
so maybe this is just part of a trick?

27:24.517 --> 27:28.313
No. It's not magic. It's good police work.
I think we may have cracked the case.

27:28.897 --> 27:33.151
Uh, care to clue in the actual
police person on what that means?

27:33.234 --> 27:34.861
No? Cool.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.321
-[Lucifer sighs]
-Huh?

27:38.782 --> 27:39.866
Miss Lopez, a question.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.452
I don't have a thing for Carol at all.
I don't think he's cute.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.953
-That wasn't the question.
-Oh.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.582
When you said you didn't feel
God's presence anymore…

27:47.666 --> 27:49.501
I mean, is that such a bad thing?

27:49.584 --> 27:51.336
Uh, yeah, dude.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.963
I mean,
being ever-present is God's whole thing.

27:54.047 --> 27:57.133
That's what makes the Big Guy the Big Guy.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.343
He's always there.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.553
Right, but surely
he can't be always there. [chuckling]

28:00.637 --> 28:03.682
I mean, doesn't God have
personal matters to attend to?

28:03.765 --> 28:07.352
The odd round of golf
or spending time with loved ones?

28:07.435 --> 28:10.188
That's the best part.
He's not like you and me.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.691
We are all God's loved ones.

28:13.274 --> 28:14.693
And no matter what he's doing,

28:14.776 --> 28:21.408
the only thing, the only thing
that God cares about is caring about us.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.910
Not the only thing.
He did quite like NCIS.

28:23.993 --> 28:26.246
[Ella] It doesn't matter
who you are or what you've done,

28:26.329 --> 28:30.458
if you are Mr. Rogers
or some sleazeball Internet troll,

28:31.167 --> 28:32.836
he is there for everyone.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.881
Or at least, he's supposed to be.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.008
-Indeed.
-[sighs]

28:39.092 --> 28:41.136
We're already accessorizing alike.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.762
What's that on your wrist?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.055
[gasps]

28:44.139 --> 28:46.558
Yeah, what is that on her wrist?

28:49.227 --> 28:50.103
[hesitates]

28:50.186 --> 28:52.814
We found a bead from one
of your bracelets on Jared's body.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.859
Your actual bracelet.
Not one of the cheap, plastic handouts.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.152
What are you talking about?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.988
Maybe you lost it in the struggle?

29:00.071 --> 29:03.241
Whoa, chill out, Nancy Drew.
Why would I wanna hurt Jared?

29:03.324 --> 29:05.201
I already told you
I didn't wanna be Magnar.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.203
Wonderful. Can you please?

29:08.204 --> 29:09.706
-Ugh.
-Thank you.

29:09.789 --> 29:12.792
When in Rome. Tell me, Duran Duran…

29:14.753 --> 29:16.796
what is it you truly desire?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.591
I…

29:19.674 --> 29:21.092
I wanna be Magnar. [gulps]

29:21.843 --> 29:22.927
Do you?

29:23.511 --> 29:25.054
Uh… [hesitates]

29:26.347 --> 29:29.517
Okay, fine,
I've always wanted to be Magnar, but…

29:29.601 --> 29:33.229
[sighs] …the truth is
I'm not cut out for the stage.

29:33.313 --> 29:36.775
Do you know how many
viewing angles you have to cover?

29:36.858 --> 29:38.568
Instagram, man, it's way easier.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.695
You just set up the camera
in the perfect angle,

29:40.779 --> 29:43.239
do it as many times as you need,
let the likes pour in.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.534
Oh, so, I see. You weren't
a good enough magician to be like Magnar.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.661
Hey, hey, I'm a great magician…

29:50.205 --> 29:51.664
on Instagram.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.085
You know what?

29:57.420 --> 29:59.547
[chuckles] That's okay.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.634
You know what? You should've
thought of that before you killed Jared.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.511
Turn around.
You're under arrest. Turn around.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.637
[Carol] Miss Decker!

30:09.140 --> 30:10.600
Can I talk to you for a second?

30:12.393 --> 30:15.063
So Uncle Hanjobadiel, the angel of giving,

30:15.146 --> 30:18.525
left us with the gift
of a $4,000 plumbing bill.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.944
-[laughing]
-Oh, my God.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.946
Well, that's just
the kind of thing that happens

30:23.029 --> 30:25.990
when you have hundreds
of celestial family members.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.871
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry, Eve.
I didn't mean to bring up a sore subject.

30:33.039 --> 30:36.960
I know how complicated it is
between you and your family, Maze.

30:37.043 --> 30:40.755
It's complicated enough when
humans meet their partners' families,

30:40.839 --> 30:44.092
but when it's celestial,
it's so much bigger.

30:45.510 --> 30:49.389
It really bothers me that you don't
want me spending time with your family.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.185
Maze, it's important
to discuss these issues.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.397
And it's important to eat this
ice cream torture cake before it melts.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.525
I don't want to talk about Hell!

31:01.401 --> 31:02.902
-Maze.
-Linda.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.070
Amenadiel.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.321
-Linda.
-Stop.

31:05.405 --> 31:08.032
I don't wanna talk about it
because I don't wanna go!

31:12.620 --> 31:15.039
You don't want to go to Hell?

31:15.123 --> 31:17.083
Look, I hate to disappoint you.

31:17.166 --> 31:21.796
I know how excited you are
for me to be queen, but I like it here.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.928
[laughs] I don't wanna go to Hell either.

31:29.012 --> 31:29.929
[laughs]

31:30.013 --> 31:32.724
I just thought going home
would make you happy.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.101
I don't need to go home to be happy.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.644
You're my Hell.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.272
I love bounty hunting here.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.608
It's so much better
when they're still alive, you know.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.192
You can really feel the fear. [laughs]

31:43.276 --> 31:45.695
Fear! I know.
That's-- I love that part too.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.740
And I love what we do after even more.

31:48.823 --> 31:49.991
-[Mazikeen] Yes!
-[Eve laughs]

31:50.074 --> 31:53.119
Yeah, I love you. I love our life.
I could do this forever.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.496
-Forever?
-Yeah. I could marry you tomorrow.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.497
Okay.

31:58.374 --> 32:02.211
Uh, I mean, not tomorrow, but…

32:02.837 --> 32:06.007
uh, yeah, hell, yeah. [chuckles]

32:06.090 --> 32:08.134
-[gasps]
-Did we just get engaged?

32:10.637 --> 32:13.932
-[gasps]
-[Eve laughing] Oh, my God!

32:14.015 --> 32:16.476
[both laugh and shout]

32:16.559 --> 32:19.312
[Eve laughing] Oh, my God!

32:19.395 --> 32:21.981
-Oh, my God. Oh, I love you.
-[mouths] Thank you.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.778
Aww.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.372
[chattering]

32:39.791 --> 32:42.585
Miss Decker, with all due respect,

32:42.669 --> 32:45.129
I cannot have you
tampering with this investigation.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.967
Mm-hmm, and with all due respect,
I think I just found your killer for you.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.135
-He had motive, opportunity--
-And an alibi.

32:51.219 --> 32:55.765
He was performing magic for several women
during the window of time of the murder,

32:55.848 --> 32:58.309
and they all have
the bracelets to prove it.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.813
Right. Well, I don't think it's Erika.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.565
I saw her body language
when you interrogated her.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.068
She was sad, resigned,
but she wasn't angry.

33:07.151 --> 33:10.113
I agree. And she also has a bracelet.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.448
Miss Decker. Chloe.

33:13.449 --> 33:15.284
I am in a tough situation here.

33:15.868 --> 33:18.705
Now, you and I both know
that the killer is still in this room,

33:18.788 --> 33:20.873
but I have no clues, and I have no leads,

33:20.957 --> 33:24.794
and I cannot hold everyone here on
the basis of suspicion alone much longer.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.339
While I do not appreciate
you running a parallel investigation

33:28.423 --> 33:30.633
for the entire evening…

33:32.635 --> 33:35.346
I would truly appreciate
your thoughts now.

33:36.222 --> 33:39.225
Oh, of course, um…

33:40.518 --> 33:43.604
So if the killer isn't Keaton,
the bead had to be planted.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.482
The killer had to know how to get
the right kind, not the cheap plastic.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.193
-So it's premeditated. It's a frame job.
-[Chloe] Right.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.404
Which means the killer wanted
to remove Magnar's current

33:51.487 --> 33:54.198
and former apprentice too,
but the question is why.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.202
The Magnar name.
It's worth a lot of money.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.539
I heard a lot of whispers
about a media deal in the works.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.833
But when I asked Magnar about it,
he said he'd never sell.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.710
He said Jared would never sell either.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.712
[Chloe] Wait, so if Magnar won't sell,

34:07.795 --> 34:09.714
-and neither would Jared…
-[Carol] Right.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.759
…how did this deal get done?
I mean, who benefits?

34:15.011 --> 34:18.264
Wait, what kind of law
did you say the son practices? [gasps]

34:18.347 --> 34:20.433
-[Alan] No, back up, buddy.
-[clamoring]

34:27.440 --> 34:29.108
Okay, everybody.

34:30.568 --> 34:31.652
Let's all stay cool.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.613
[Alan] Oh, cool? You know what's cool?

34:33.696 --> 34:35.656
A billion dollar franchise is cool.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.867
But no!
Magic's not cool. It's art, right, Dad?

34:37.950 --> 34:39.744
Is that what this is about? Money?

34:39.827 --> 34:43.456
It's about your legacy! I was gonna help
you bring it into every home in the world,

34:43.539 --> 34:46.084
but instead,
you cut me out and anointed Jared

34:46.167 --> 34:47.960
to honor the traditions
and all that bullshit.

34:48.044 --> 34:49.962
-[Chloe] That's what happened with Jared?
-Mm-hmm.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.756
He wouldn't play ball
with your media deal?

34:51.839 --> 34:52.882
Oh, the deal was done.

34:52.965 --> 34:56.010
All Jared had to do was
sign and cash checks. But not Jared!

34:56.094 --> 34:58.846
He's just as stubborn as the last Magnar!

34:58.930 --> 35:01.349
Wait. So you sharpened a sword
that was supposed to be dull

35:01.432 --> 35:04.393
and you framed Keaton 'cause
you knew that he'd be next in line?

35:04.477 --> 35:07.605
And because of his media savvy,
you knew he could make a deal of his own?

35:07.688 --> 35:10.441
[Alan shuddering]

35:11.859 --> 35:13.236
This is all your fault.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.988
Every bit of this is your fault.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.323
You and your selfishness!

35:17.406 --> 35:18.825
[laughs] Selfishness?

35:19.450 --> 35:22.829
All you ever cared about
was your own greed and desire.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.039
You are the one who's selfish.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.626
He doesn't care about the consequences
and look at what you've done!

35:28.709 --> 35:31.420
You are not worthy
of your father's legacy!

35:31.504 --> 35:33.089
[Carol] Think about it, Alan.

35:33.172 --> 35:35.842
Just drop the knife.
You know there's no way out of here.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.179
-[Chloe gasps]
-That's where you're wrong.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.182
I may not be a magician…

35:44.600 --> 35:45.643
but I grew up here.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.312
[Chloe whimpers]
-No! No!

35:48.396 --> 35:49.981
-[Carol] Damn it.
[Lucifer] No! No!

35:50.064 --> 35:53.734
-Find me something to pry this open with!
-[Ella] Oh! That door! Now! Hurry!

35:53.818 --> 35:55.278
[door breaking]

35:56.946 --> 35:57.864
[Carol exhales]

36:01.951 --> 36:02.827
Chloe!

36:08.708 --> 36:09.542
Chloe!

36:14.172 --> 36:15.006
Chloe!

36:17.717 --> 36:21.512
If you harm one hair on her head,
I swear I will break every--

36:21.596 --> 36:22.930
[grunts]

36:25.183 --> 36:27.560
-What--
-[Chloe panting]

36:35.359 --> 36:36.861
[both gasp]

36:36.944 --> 36:38.404
[Lucifer] Amenadiel's necklace.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.406
You kept it.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.533
[Chloe] It helped me
survive an angel-demon war,

36:42.617 --> 36:45.286
so I thought it might come in handy again.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.789
[scoffs] So, just to be clear,
you were never actually in danger,

36:48.873 --> 36:50.791
and you could've gotten away
at any moment.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.420
[chuckles] Well, we needed a confession.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.255
[laughs]

36:58.841 --> 37:00.176
[sighs]

37:01.594 --> 37:05.973
Once the detective,
always the detective. [chuckles]

37:07.016 --> 37:07.850
Yeah.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.605
[Lucifer] To being right.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.273
Because I solved the case?

37:14.357 --> 37:16.817
No, because I was right
about the secret passageways.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.903
[both laugh]

37:21.906 --> 37:23.991
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

37:24.075 --> 37:28.204
but I thought I put that
in my safe with Azrael's blade.

37:29.455 --> 37:31.791
-Yeah. You did.
-Hmm.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.460
I shouldn't have taken it.

37:34.543 --> 37:35.670
Why did you?

37:36.671 --> 37:39.131
[sighs] It's kind of hard to explain.

37:39.215 --> 37:44.387
After so many years of being a cop
and walking around every day armed,

37:44.470 --> 37:49.433
I just felt weirdly naked
without a way to defend myself.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.061
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have taken it without asking you.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.729
-You can have that back.
-[sighs]

37:53.813 --> 37:57.942
Well, as much as I enjoy the mental image
of you walking around weirdly naked…

37:58.025 --> 38:00.194
-[chuckles]
-…you should keep it.

38:00.736 --> 38:03.531
Especially since we'll be
here on Earth a little longer.

38:04.490 --> 38:07.535
Lucifer, I heard
what you said to Magnar's son.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.580
And you have to understand,
you are not the same as him.

38:11.664 --> 38:15.167
-[scoffs]
-You are worthy of your father's legacy.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.336
This isn't so much an issue of worth.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.796
It's… [inhales]

38:18.879 --> 38:21.382
…more an issue of job description.

38:22.258 --> 38:26.262
God needs to be selfless.
He needs to care about all of humanity.

38:27.888 --> 38:28.764
[hesitates]

38:28.848 --> 38:32.184
You-- you died for me.
What could be more selfless than that?

38:32.268 --> 38:34.145
Well, you see, that's just it.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.355
I love you, Chloe Decker.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.816
I'd do anything for you.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.444
Except give you up.

38:42.737 --> 38:43.654
Give us up.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.614
What do you mean?

38:47.074 --> 38:52.538
Well, much as I claim to know what will
happen to me when I become God, I don't.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.583
I'm scared.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.376
I'm scared of…

38:58.502 --> 39:00.212
what it'll mean for us.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.924
Well, I'm not scared.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.970
-I love you too, Lucifer Morningstar.
-[exhales]

39:08.054 --> 39:10.681
And I have faith
that you'll figure this out.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.683
-You do?
-Yeah.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.491
So… [sighs]

39:29.658 --> 39:31.035
…are we gonna talk about it?

39:31.118 --> 39:33.037
Yeah, I know. [laughing]

39:33.120 --> 39:35.498
The hellfire queso
was a disaster. [laughs]

39:35.581 --> 39:38.000
I think everyone was trying
to be so polite about it,

39:38.084 --> 39:41.462
but I saw Maze
dump hers in the spider plant.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.968
-We're not talking about the queso.
-No.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.972
I mean how you spent the entire night

39:52.056 --> 39:54.850
probing and prodding
at Maze and Eve's relationship issues.

39:54.934 --> 39:59.146
I was just encouraging them
to work through some unresolved issues.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.940
Uh-huh. And why were you doing that?

40:01.023 --> 40:02.566
Because I'm a good friend.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.820
And an even better therapist.
I mean, you saw.

40:05.903 --> 40:09.865
From almost broken up to engaged
over a single dinner. I mean… [laughs]

40:09.949 --> 40:11.492
I should put that on my website.

40:11.575 --> 40:15.121
Linda, you are a great therapist,
and you did help them.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.038
You did.

40:17.039 --> 40:22.628
But you see, I wonder if some of that
was maybe for your own benefit as well?

40:24.713 --> 40:26.549
Well, maybe…

40:28.217 --> 40:30.553
you're not so bad a therapist yourself.

40:30.636 --> 40:33.055
-[chuckles]
-Okay, I admit.

40:33.139 --> 40:36.058
I admit it, but after God himself
has been on my couch,

40:36.142 --> 40:39.103
it's very difficult
to go back to normal problems.

40:39.186 --> 40:41.939
It's like, "Okay, I'm sorry
you slept with your yoga teacher, again."

40:42.022 --> 40:44.608
-[laughs]
-But I helped saved the universe.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.152
So you thought you would get a rush

40:46.235 --> 40:49.947
from some celestial therapy
one last time before they head south?

40:52.408 --> 40:53.242
Linda.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.453
[sighs]

40:56.120 --> 40:58.080
Yeah, listen, uh…

40:59.540 --> 41:04.587
nobody understands better than me
how earthly things can feel small.

41:05.379 --> 41:08.883
I mean, I was a warrior angel,
fighting for the Silver City,

41:08.966 --> 41:12.636
and now, I'm in training to be a beat cop.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.513
-Okay?
-[both laugh]

41:15.598 --> 41:17.308
But you wanna know what I've learned?

41:17.892 --> 41:18.893
What?

41:19.477 --> 41:23.189
[clicks tongue] No problem is too small.

41:23.772 --> 41:25.566
Whatever good deed you do in the world,

41:25.649 --> 41:30.112
whether it's helping someone
on your block, or…

41:30.946 --> 41:35.367
I don't know, throwing some
elaborate dinner party for your friends…

41:36.410 --> 41:41.207
you are just as much of a hero as you are
fighting a war for the throne of Heaven.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.667
Every act matters.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.551
That's very insightful.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.891
But I don't know if I'm there yet.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.937
Or if I ever will be.

42:37.304 --> 42:39.598
[wings flap]

42:46.397 --> 42:48.399
[indistinct shouting]

43:07.334 --> 43:08.669
[Dan] Ooh!

43:08.752 --> 43:09.712
-Out!
-Are you kidding?

43:09.795 --> 43:11.130
-Yes, it is.
-That was totally in!

43:11.213 --> 43:13.799
You were going for the head.
You were going here.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.134
[Lucifer] What's the score?

43:15.217 --> 43:17.261
[Dan] Hey, there you are,
buddy, what's up?

43:17.344 --> 43:19.430
[exhales, rubs hands together]

43:19.513 --> 43:20.723
What's the plan this time?

43:21.932 --> 43:25.185
I'm-- I'm sorry, Daniel. [sighs]

43:25.311 --> 43:27.730
I can't think of anything new.
I've just come to check in.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.734
Check in? [chuckles]

43:31.817 --> 43:32.651
On what?

43:33.485 --> 43:34.987
Nothing's changed.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.698
I'm still in Hell.
It still sucks. Belios still sucks.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.742
Ping-pong is not his game, dude.

43:39.825 --> 43:42.494
-[Lucifer scoffs]
-Hey. I'm getting better.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.623
It's been almost a thousand years here,
and you still can't keep a volley going.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.916
Daniel, I have commanded
the demons to not torture you.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.712
You are the first soul
ever in this "purgatory."

43:51.795 --> 43:54.298
[sighs] I've invented
an entirely new afterlife for you,

43:54.381 --> 43:57.176
so I apologize
if Belios' serve isn't up to snuff.

43:57.259 --> 43:59.720
It's more my backhand that's weak.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.516
-[Dan sighs]
-[Lucifer groans]

44:05.100 --> 44:07.436
Look. I'm sorry.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.564
I know you're the one stuck here.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.775
You know, I've tried every door.

44:12.858 --> 44:16.570
[laughs] Hell, I even tried
the one that guy Lee walks through.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.614
Well, Lee's door was
a metaphor for his own guilt.

44:18.697 --> 44:20.366
I know it was a metaphor, Lucifer.

44:21.825 --> 44:22.910
Right.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.829
And I know that we're all
tortured by our own guilt down here.

44:25.913 --> 44:29.166
But you know as well as I do
that I've dealt with all my guilt.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.294
So why am I still here?

44:33.003 --> 44:37.007
Why was that guy able to make it
into Heaven and literally no one else?

44:37.091 --> 44:38.050
Why not me?

44:40.010 --> 44:41.261
I don't know.

44:41.845 --> 44:44.056
Well, it seems pretty simple to me.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.267
Just stop screwing around and go be God.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.395
-[exhales]
-Then you can just, like, beam me up.

44:49.478 --> 44:52.106
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel,
we have been through this.

44:52.189 --> 44:54.149
If I act against your wishes,

44:54.233 --> 44:57.986
no matter how unconscious those
are, then that is the end of free will,

44:58.070 --> 45:00.197
which I cannot do.
