00:10.427 --> 00:13.763
Previously on 90 Day Fiance:
The Other Way...

00:13.847 --> 00:15.724
I'm just gonna be honest with you.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.892
I love you but you need to wake up.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.730
You did your little thing.
You had the baby in Ethiopia.

00:21.813 --> 00:25.942
Now you gotta get real
about where you're gonna raise him.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.822
I wanna have a baby
that has your blood.

00:30.905 --> 00:35.452
I know Armando would have a
difficult time talking to his family

00:35.535 --> 00:38.538
if we were to adopt an HIV child.

00:38.621 --> 00:42.208
I would rather help a kid
than make a kid.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.773
They're for you.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.649
Evelin wants me to leave but

01:06.733 --> 01:09.110
I told her I'm gonna fight
for our relationship.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.197
Until the day that
I'm basically forced out of there.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.949
I am changed.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.038
If Evelin serves me
with divorce papers right now,

01:20.121 --> 01:21.956
I'll rip them up in her face.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.922
Sumit's mom is trying to make me
feel bad, trying to make me look bad

01:29.005 --> 01:31.007
and she's just trying
to find reasons

01:31.091 --> 01:35.303
to say Jenny is not good enough
for my son.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.891
I wish that
they would just leave now.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.004
I could throw anything into this.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.340
That's probably good.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.635
Put some mustard in there too
cos why not? I don't know.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.347
Ooh, do we have any garlic?
That'll be nice.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.017
After living with Raoul for a week,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.686
I decided it was the right time
to move to my own place,

02:24.769 --> 02:27.689
which is close to
me and Evelin's old apartment.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.858
And I've been here for a few weeks.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.943
There we go.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.779
I've been pushing myself
to not reach out to Evelin,

02:34.863 --> 02:38.283
to give her some space
and some time to cool down.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.828
And I asked Evelin
to come over for dinner

02:41.911 --> 02:43.997
and she's finally agreed to it.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.458
I am just trying to prove to Evelin

02:46.541 --> 02:48.960
that I can be the man
that she needs me to be.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.670
And I hope she sees that tonight.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.385
EVELIN: Hello!

02:57.469 --> 02:59.387
I'm here.
Hey. Just one second.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.389
Stay there one second. One second.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.558
I'll be right there.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.728
OK.
Hello?

03:06.853 --> 03:09.814
OK, you're welcome
to come on upstairs. OK.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.701
Hello, beautiful.
How's it going? Good.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.827
Good.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.206
Um... Have a...

03:29.751 --> 03:32.504
We got burgers.
You know, you like my burgers.

03:32.587 --> 03:36.508
So I got those on the... I've
got those going for you right now.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.593
If you want,
you can have a seat here.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.680
Um...
Yeah, those flowers are for you.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.141
As well.
Thank you. Yeah, of course.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.229
Um... Good. I gotta...
The burgers are burning right now

03:49.312 --> 03:52.732
so gonna get that plated up for you.
I'll be right back here.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.444
(CLATTER)
Oops.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.613
(LAUGHS) OK. I'm fine.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.244
I've been good.
It's nice of you to come over.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.413
I really appreciate this.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.775
Been missing you a lot.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.990
Here is your burger. I'll be
right back with mine as well.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.450
Thank you.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.411
There you go. There's more onions,

04:46.494 --> 04:49.247
there's tomatoes, there's whatever,
all that stuff too.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.547
Well, you're important to me.
This is important to me.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.090
I want to look nice.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.512
And I've got mine here.
And of course, ketchup.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.681
I love my ketchup, as you know.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.187
How's everything been?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.522
Uh, everything has been good for me.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.900
Yeah?
Yeah. How's it been for you?

05:19.778 --> 05:22.197
Been pretty...
Uh...it's been pretty lonely.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.366
I'm not gonna lie.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.996
So how do you like the place?
Do you like it here?

05:40.590 --> 05:41.633
Look, I...

05:43.176 --> 05:46.471
You know, I really messed up.
I get that. OK?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.390
I understand that.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.434
And I'm paying the consequences
for it right now.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.480
Like, I'm just so sorry
for what I've done.

05:55.563 --> 05:59.234
Like, words can't express,
you know, how sorry I am.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.446
And how much I want to prove to you
that that's not who I am,

06:03.530 --> 06:08.785
that you can trust me
as a husband and as a life partner.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.954
You know? Like...

06:47.032 --> 06:52.078
I'm just here, hoping, wishing
and praying that you'll forgive me

06:52.162 --> 06:54.247
and we can move past this and...

06:55.206 --> 06:57.125
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.670
Whatever it takes, you know,
for us to make it through this.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.688
If you wanna see a therapist,
we will. Whatever it takes to help.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.612
I agree.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.077
If we put further effort,
both of us,

07:32.160 --> 07:34.412
I really do think
that we can move forwards

07:34.496 --> 07:36.581
and make each other happy, you know.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.304
Of course I will pay for it.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.265
(CHUCKLES)

09:19.392 --> 09:21.186
I really appreciate that

09:21.269 --> 09:25.482
with all the secrets that
I kept until we were in person,

09:25.565 --> 09:29.361
you are willing to go for it
in our lives

09:29.444 --> 09:32.405
instead of leaving with your mom.

09:32.906 --> 09:39.079
And I want to show you
that you mean the world to me

09:39.162 --> 09:40.747
and I don't want to lose you.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.558
Oh, OK.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.936
How are you feeling right now?

12:55.233 --> 13:01.656
I think that she knows that I love
you and she knows that you love me.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.577
(SNIFFLES)

13:07.746 --> 13:09.456
Shh. It's OK.

26:54.114 --> 26:54.374
2
00:13:10.320 -- 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Can I take that?

27:13.049 --> 27:15.135
Can you come to Momma?

27:15.218 --> 27:17.012
I've been in New Jersey
for a few weeks

27:17.095 --> 27:19.014
but I'm gonna have to stay
another month

27:19.097 --> 27:21.516
so I can
get Avi's hernia surgery done.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.894
Ideally I wouldn't have
had to stay in the US so long but

27:24.978 --> 27:28.940
I have no control over when the
doctors will schedule our surgery.

27:29.024 --> 27:31.109
Kisses.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.576
It's been great to be
with my family here in the US.

27:39.659 --> 27:43.079
But it's been really stressful
being so far away from Bini

27:43.163 --> 27:45.957
and it's been really hard
on our relationship.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.880
(PHONE BLEEPS)

27:51.963 --> 27:54.674
Number unavailable
because his phone is off.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.470
Bini and I have been arguing
because I haven't been happy

27:58.553 --> 28:00.138
that he has been going out so often

28:00.221 --> 28:03.224
and he didn't tell me he went out
to a nightclub the other night.

28:05.268 --> 28:06.728
Today we were fighting because

28:06.811 --> 28:09.189
when I was asking him,
"Oh, what did you do today?"

28:09.272 --> 28:11.316
Then I asked,
"What are you doing later?"

28:11.399 --> 28:13.026
He didn't understand the English.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.903
He thought
I asked the same question,

28:14.986 --> 28:16.696
which I do when I know he's lying.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.657
And then I was mad at him because
of the way he's talking to me.

28:19.741 --> 28:23.703
So I said, "Of all the things
that I have done for you,

28:23.787 --> 28:27.248
like have my baby there,
be away from my family,

28:27.332 --> 28:30.543
I said, "I'm forgetting anything
you've ever done nice for me

28:30.627 --> 28:32.545
so if you could name one thing,

28:32.629 --> 28:36.007
that would go a really
long way to making me feel better.

28:36.091 --> 28:38.009
It would remind me
of the good things.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.428
Cos right now
I'm only focusing on the negative".

28:40.512 --> 28:42.931
He was like, "I've never done
anything nice for you.

28:43.014 --> 28:46.226
Just find yourself an American man,
if that's what you want".

28:46.309 --> 28:48.269
And I said,
"I don't want another man.

28:48.353 --> 28:49.854
I just want the father of my baby

28:49.938 --> 28:53.692
to be decent to me and to Avi.
That's all".

28:53.775 --> 28:58.154
And then he hung up the phone
and now his phone is off.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.532
Then I texted him, "You promised me

29:00.615 --> 29:04.077
you wouldn't turn off your phone
any more. More broken promises".

29:05.745 --> 29:07.831
I talk to Bini all the time
about this.

29:07.914 --> 29:12.252
I said there's only one thing that
I cannot handle, that I cannot take,

29:12.335 --> 29:14.879
is the turning off your phone
and not even...

29:14.963 --> 29:17.674
Like, not even giving me a chance.
And also we have a son.

29:17.757 --> 29:21.052
What if something happens to Avi
and I want to call you or something?

29:21.136 --> 29:24.055
He knows that he's taking away
all control from me,

29:24.139 --> 29:26.683
knowing that I'm far away
and he can turn off his phone

29:26.766 --> 29:28.560
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

29:28.643 --> 29:32.105
So I just feel like he really
just wants to hurt my feelings.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.703
Finally you decide
to answer your phone.

29:47.495 --> 29:48.580
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

29:48.663 --> 29:51.458
You turned off your phone
for like three hours.

30:04.304 --> 30:06.890
That's the same as
turning your phone off, baby.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.397
Honestly,
I really don't think you care.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.358
You're having a great time
without me.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.569
You go to the club every weekend
for like three weeks.

30:32.123 --> 30:33.708
No, you know what makes me upset?

30:33.792 --> 30:37.212
When I call you and you turn
your phone off for three hours.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.386
No, that's not cool.

30:45.553 --> 30:51.309
It's very painful for me
when you do not answer the phone.

30:51.393 --> 30:55.480
And it makes me feel like
you don't care about me at all.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.576
You know what I'm always
hearing from you? "All my friends.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.329
My friends are very important.
I need to see my friends.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.206
I need to talk to my friends".

31:13.581 --> 31:15.875
What about me?
I need you. Avi needs you.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.545
Your friends
are not the most important thing.

31:18.628 --> 31:21.423
We are supposed to be
the most important thing.

31:25.427 --> 31:29.597
I don't have anything
personally against his friends.

31:29.681 --> 31:34.436
My issue is that a lot of them
don't have successful relationships

31:34.519 --> 31:36.938
or are not in a relationship or

31:37.022 --> 31:39.941
they don't have
the same value system

31:40.025 --> 31:44.362
that I want to impart
to my child and to Bini.

31:44.446 --> 31:49.034
And I feel like that's why they
don't take him in a good direction.

31:59.169 --> 32:01.046
No, baby that's not what I...

32:01.129 --> 32:04.466
Baby, since I left, you do
whatever the hell you feel like.

32:04.549 --> 32:07.594
You literally do anything you want.
You go out any time you want,

32:07.677 --> 32:10.805
you hang out with your friends,
you drink, you do whatever you want

32:10.889 --> 32:13.183
so don't tell me
I've become more boss.

32:13.266 --> 32:16.478
If anything, I have no control
over the situation at all.

32:23.902 --> 32:24.944
I'm listening.

32:28.698 --> 32:31.242
OK. So show me that.

32:32.994 --> 32:38.833
Could you...not turn off your phone
or put it on airplane mode

32:38.917 --> 32:40.627
until I get back to Ethiopia?

32:46.216 --> 32:47.425
Promise?

32:52.847 --> 32:54.724
I've been so hurt
by Bini's behaviour

32:54.808 --> 32:56.601
since I've been in America.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.229
I mean, why is he turning off
his phone if not because

32:59.312 --> 33:02.190
he doesn't want me to know
where he is and what he's doing.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.317
Obviously he's hiding something.

33:10.115 --> 33:12.200
OK. I love you too.

33:14.077 --> 33:16.162
OK. I'll talk to you soon.

33:42.689 --> 33:45.817
Sumit's parents
arrived at our house earlier today.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.902
And it's already a big (BLEEP) show.

33:47.986 --> 33:51.114
Sumit's mom started pointing out
everything that was wrong.

33:51.197 --> 33:54.117
And showing me how things should be.

34:01.624 --> 34:03.918
I know how.
This one's a different one.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.506
There we go.

34:10.925 --> 34:12.719
Sumit offered to cook dinner tonight

34:12.802 --> 34:15.180
but his mom insisted
that she cook the dinner

34:15.263 --> 34:17.307
and Jenny come in there
and cook with her.

34:17.390 --> 34:20.518
She's gonna show me
how much I don't know, basically.

34:30.403 --> 34:32.489
No, it's very hard to...

34:35.950 --> 34:36.993
I'm twisting it!

34:39.287 --> 34:40.330
Oh...

34:40.663 --> 34:44.250
I try.
Just right now I can't open it.

34:44.334 --> 34:46.419
But any other time I can open it.

35:40.932 --> 35:42.392
What it needs?

35:45.311 --> 35:46.354
I don't know.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.149
Oh...

35:52.652 --> 35:53.737
I don't know.

36:00.910 --> 36:03.747
I don't speak Hindi and
his mother doesn't speak English

36:03.830 --> 36:06.458
so I don't know
how I'm gonna understand her.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.966
Whoa! Me?!

36:16.760 --> 36:17.886
I can try.

36:21.514 --> 36:22.557
OK.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.988
I'm not a good cook, OK?

36:44.996 --> 36:47.082
Don't understand you, Sahna.

36:51.419 --> 36:52.462
OK.

36:55.048 --> 36:56.216
Oh, you.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.259
You.

36:59.844 --> 37:03.098
To my surprise, the vibe that I'm
getting from Sumit's mom right now

37:03.181 --> 37:05.767
is actually very positive

37:05.850 --> 37:09.688
and I think that
we could actually be friends again.

37:11.731 --> 37:12.816
OK.

37:12.899 --> 37:16.486
She's sincere and she's really
trying to teach me how to cook this.

37:16.569 --> 37:21.324
And actually enjoying herself
and I even am seeing her smile.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.460
All good? OK?

37:33.878 --> 37:35.964
Yeah, it's hot.

37:40.885 --> 37:41.928
Mm-hm.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.400
OK, it's good?

37:57.318 --> 37:59.404
No good? Oh, Sahna!

49:06.696 --> 49:06.957

00:23:53.560 -- 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:90% position:50%
We're gonna go to the park.
You wanna come?

49:30.345 --> 49:33.473
I'll come down in a little bit.
I'm gonna call the girls. All right.

49:33.556 --> 49:35.642
OK.
Have fun.

49:35.767 --> 49:38.311
Love you.
Is that a soccer outfit? (LAUGHS)

49:38.395 --> 49:41.648
Come over the park when you're done.
I will. OK. Bye. Bye.

49:42.982 --> 49:45.068
Love you the most!

49:45.151 --> 49:48.655
After a lot of talk with Armando
about adoption

49:48.738 --> 49:51.825
and having a surrogate,
we're giving it some time

49:51.908 --> 49:54.536
cos we have to think
what we really want to do.

49:55.412 --> 49:57.831
But the possibility
of us expanding our family

49:57.914 --> 50:00.542
is making me miss my children a lot.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.711
(RINGING TONE)

50:03.420 --> 50:04.462
Ola!

50:05.505 --> 50:07.382
Hi. Ola.

50:07.465 --> 50:08.717
How are you guys doing?

50:09.843 --> 50:12.137
Ah, you know Spanish.
That's Spanish.

50:13.555 --> 50:15.724
My entire family
is coming for the wedding,

50:15.807 --> 50:17.100
which makes me so, so happy.

50:17.183 --> 50:21.021
We talk as much as we can.
But it's not the same.

50:21.730 --> 50:25.150
How are you guys doing?
Good. Doing good. Yeah.

50:25.483 --> 50:27.902
How's work, Madison?
Did you get the job?

50:29.654 --> 50:30.697
Yeah. Mm-hm.

50:30.780 --> 50:33.867
Did you already tell them
that you need off for a wedding?

50:33.950 --> 50:36.036
Yeah. Mm-hm. They already know.

50:36.578 --> 50:39.289
Well, I'm glad you're coming out
a little early.

50:39.372 --> 50:43.877
I really miss,
like, you and Cooper a lot.

50:43.960 --> 50:46.463
Well, you had a bit part
in helping me raise Cooper

50:46.546 --> 50:48.173
for, what three years?

50:48.256 --> 50:51.301
The first three years of his life,
every single day.

50:53.386 --> 50:55.472
He misses his Grampy.
Yeah.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.183
I can't believe how long it's been
since I've seen him.

50:58.266 --> 51:00.685
I can't believe he's five.
Holy crap.

51:00.769 --> 51:02.937
Oh, jeez.

51:03.021 --> 51:06.024
How do you feel about
becoming a new grandpa again?

51:08.109 --> 51:10.945
I know it's different
cos you're far away but...

51:11.613 --> 51:13.698
(SNIFFS)

51:15.492 --> 51:16.576
Well, are you excited?

51:16.659 --> 51:21.414
Yes, I'm just... I'm also
a little bit miserable about it all.

51:21.498 --> 51:23.583
Because you know, Cassidy, that...

51:27.629 --> 51:31.257
I want nothing more than to be
with you through this. (SNIFFS)

51:32.467 --> 51:34.844
About a week ago,
my daughter Cassidy called me

51:34.928 --> 51:36.638
to tell me she was pregnant.

51:36.721 --> 51:39.182
I've always been right
side-by-side on my children

51:39.265 --> 51:43.311
through anything that happened,
any milestone in their life.

51:43.395 --> 51:47.273
And now milestones
are happening without me.

51:48.483 --> 51:50.568
It's...

51:50.652 --> 51:54.280
You know, when Madison
was going to have Cooper,

51:54.364 --> 51:59.202
I enjoyed her pregnancy
and...sharing it with her.

52:01.246 --> 52:03.832
It definitely made us a lot closer,
for sure.

52:05.333 --> 52:09.254
Like... I know. Like that was
our big bonding moment.

52:11.214 --> 52:14.467
I know I'm missing out on a lot.
And...

52:16.845 --> 52:18.555
..a lot of it I haven't been

52:18.638 --> 52:21.016
completely honest
with Armando about.

52:22.350 --> 52:24.436
(SNIFFS)

52:24.811 --> 52:26.896
That I really am homesick a lot.

52:30.150 --> 52:32.235
And you know, I...

52:32.318 --> 52:36.322
Sometimes I feel...like all alone.

52:38.825 --> 52:41.077
You know, cos I realise...
I know what you mean.

52:41.161 --> 52:43.788
I'm in a completely different
country and...

52:44.581 --> 52:47.667
The worst part of this,
with Cassie telling me

52:47.751 --> 52:49.878
that she's pregnant
and going to have a baby,

52:49.961 --> 52:53.715
is I realise life keeps marching on

52:53.798 --> 52:55.884
and it's marching on...

52:58.595 --> 52:59.679
..like, without me.

53:00.430 --> 53:03.350
Armando is the love of my life
and I love Hannah and everything

53:03.433 --> 53:08.563
but I still feel alone and
I don't have what I've always had,

53:08.646 --> 53:10.732
which was you guys.

53:13.610 --> 53:15.779
I honestly didn't realise

53:15.862 --> 53:19.324
the emotional impact it would
have on me leaving my family.

53:19.949 --> 53:24.120
I've been the happiest
I've ever been in my life

53:24.204 --> 53:27.457
but I've also been the saddest
I've ever been in my life.

53:31.211 --> 53:32.962
Do you think there's like...

53:33.046 --> 53:36.591
I mean, you can be brutally honest.
Do you feel that there's any hope

53:36.675 --> 53:40.095
that you guys would move
to the States at any point in life?

53:42.430 --> 53:44.516
Um... I don't think Armando...

53:47.977 --> 53:51.314
..at this point wants to
move to the United States at all.

53:52.399 --> 53:55.235
You know, we talked about
where we want to live

53:55.318 --> 53:56.569
and all that kind of stuff.

53:56.653 --> 53:59.656
And he was adamant
about wanting to live in Mexico.

53:59.739 --> 54:02.075
Didn't want to take Hannah away
right now.

54:02.158 --> 54:05.662
You know, sometimes I wish
we would have talked about it more.

54:05.745 --> 54:07.831
But I committed to it.

54:09.624 --> 54:12.544
I fell in love with someone
from another country.

54:13.670 --> 54:16.464
And sometimes life has hard choices.

54:20.969 --> 54:24.764
I don't talk to Armando a lot
about how homesick I really am.

54:25.640 --> 54:29.477
But I know I have to have
a conversation with Armando

54:29.561 --> 54:31.938
about some of my feelings.

54:59.716 --> 55:01.384
Hi.

55:01.468 --> 55:02.510
Hi.

55:04.054 --> 55:07.349
Well, I'm cooking with your mother.

55:09.768 --> 55:14.439
It was good. You know, I just
felt a little bit under pressure.

55:14.522 --> 55:16.274
But mostly nervous.

55:16.358 --> 55:18.985
Just cooking with your mom
makes me nervous.

55:19.235 --> 55:22.614
When you left the kitchen, I was so
scared. I wanted you to come back.

55:32.749 --> 55:35.293
I can't open the...
I've never been able to open that.

55:36.252 --> 55:37.337
No. I can never open it.

55:37.420 --> 55:40.423
I think one time I
even called you to come open that.

55:41.091 --> 55:43.176
The salt. I can never open that.

55:45.053 --> 55:48.098
No, I've never been able to open it.
I can't open that.

55:48.473 --> 55:50.558
But anyways...

55:51.226 --> 55:53.311
It was fine. It was good.

55:53.478 --> 55:56.773
She was teaching me
a little bit of Hindi along the way.

55:56.856 --> 55:58.775
Yeah?
I don't know what I was saying.

55:58.858 --> 56:02.153
I know some things I was saying
but not everything.

56:02.237 --> 56:05.240
It was fun. It was nice.
I enjoyed cooking with her.

56:26.428 --> 56:28.513
She just kept asking me for this...

56:28.847 --> 56:31.266
"Get this bowl, get this plate.
Where's the spoon?

56:31.349 --> 56:32.600
Where's the rolling pin?"

56:32.684 --> 56:35.895
You know, "Get this, get that.
Where's this? Where's that?"

56:35.979 --> 56:37.022
Yeah.

56:37.105 --> 56:40.525
I mean, I think it went really well.
Better than I expected.

56:40.608 --> 56:44.571
But I don't know if I could handle
everything that's gonna go on.

56:44.863 --> 56:46.948
I still am, like, sceptical.

56:47.615 --> 56:51.828
But now I'm starting to see
things in a more positive light.

56:52.495 --> 56:54.539
Her and I get along really very fine

56:54.622 --> 56:57.792
as long as
she doesn't be too hard on me

56:57.876 --> 57:00.628
and start picking on me for things,
you know.

57:00.712 --> 57:02.255
Don't pick on me for stuff.

57:11.097 --> 57:13.558
Oh, yeah, I complimented her
in the kitchen.

57:13.641 --> 57:18.855
I told her, "Perfection.
Like, you do everything perfect.

57:18.938 --> 57:21.024
Everything is perfection".

57:21.441 --> 57:25.737
I don't know. I don't know if she
did but I told it to her so...

57:27.238 --> 57:28.281
Huh?

57:29.532 --> 57:30.575
Uh-oh.

57:51.012 --> 57:52.931
OK. Let's go.

57:53.014 --> 57:54.641
You look really good today.

57:54.724 --> 57:56.810
Oh, thank you, Steven.

57:57.811 --> 58:00.438
Alina's mom has gone back home
to Russia.

58:00.522 --> 58:03.066
And now there's
just the two of us again,

58:03.149 --> 58:05.276
I feel like we'll have
a better opportunity

58:05.360 --> 58:06.695
to work through our issues

58:06.778 --> 58:10.532
and relieve a lot of the stress
that has been kind of building up.

58:12.117 --> 58:14.202
Hello.
Hey. How's it going?

58:14.744 --> 58:17.038
Hello.
I made an appointment. Steven.

58:18.456 --> 58:19.499
Uh-huh.

58:23.128 --> 58:24.170
OK.

58:25.213 --> 58:28.299
So, I decided
to take Alina to the hamam,

58:28.383 --> 58:31.636
which is like a Turkish bath house
and we're gonna have a spa day.

58:34.180 --> 58:36.599
And I want to sweat out
all the bad energy,

58:36.850 --> 58:40.061
relinquish any bad feelings
and breathe more freely.

58:56.453 --> 59:00.582
We need to be quiet
because the room is super echoey.

59:00.665 --> 59:03.460
It's like Batman's lair.

59:03.543 --> 59:07.005
I don't know if his lair is echoey
but that's how I imagine it.

1:01:23.892 --> 1:01:27.145
I told Alina that I would
delete my social media a week ago.

1:01:27.228 --> 1:01:33.318
Because I didn't think that
she was gonna be super intent on it.

1:01:33.401 --> 1:01:35.445
I felt like maybe
it was one of those things

1:01:35.528 --> 1:01:38.156
where just like me saying it
would be enough.

1:01:39.032 --> 1:01:41.451
But I think now her mind
is really set.

1:01:41.534 --> 1:01:43.161
Like "This is what he has to do".

1:01:43.244 --> 1:01:45.955
So I'm kinda regretting
making that promise.

1:03:27.849 --> 1:03:29.934
Uh...

1:03:31.186 --> 1:03:33.271
(LAUGHS)

1:19:21.011 --> 1:19:21.271
2
00:38:29.880 -- 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Sumit's mother and I
cooked dinner together tonight.

1:19:51.750 --> 1:19:54.461
It went fine. It was fun, actually.

1:19:54.544 --> 1:19:58.548
It was nice. And she was
acting like a real human being.

1:19:58.631 --> 1:20:00.342
And not a crazy person.

1:20:01.718 --> 1:20:03.803
Potato curry is served.

1:20:05.472 --> 1:20:07.223
It gave me a better feeling of...

1:20:07.307 --> 1:20:11.311
Jenny, don't be so negative,
let's be hopeful

1:20:11.394 --> 1:20:14.522
and believe that this is something
that Sumit's mom really wants.

1:20:14.606 --> 1:20:17.317
She really wants
to try and reconnect with me.

1:20:20.236 --> 1:20:23.698
Maybe one day things will get better
and his parents will accept us.

1:20:30.246 --> 1:20:31.331
It's very good.

1:20:34.584 --> 1:20:36.670
I will cook for him.

1:20:40.465 --> 1:20:41.508
I will cook him this.

1:21:01.361 --> 1:21:04.406
I think I was.
I was paying attention.

1:21:27.929 --> 1:21:30.056
I thought we were staying positive

1:21:30.140 --> 1:21:32.434
and they wanted to come over
and try.

1:21:32.517 --> 1:21:35.478
But I'm looking
at Sumit's mom's face

1:21:35.562 --> 1:21:38.940
and I'm seeing that
she's probably talking bad about me,

1:21:39.024 --> 1:21:41.317
saying wrong things about me
to Sumit.

1:21:42.569 --> 1:21:43.611
It sucks.

1:22:04.090 --> 1:22:06.176
I already do all of that.

1:22:06.426 --> 1:22:08.636
The only thing I lack in is cooking.

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.306
But I do wash the clothes,
I clean the house.

1:22:11.389 --> 1:22:14.517
I clean the floor,
I wash the dishes.

1:22:14.601 --> 1:22:16.686
I do everything. Dusting.

1:23:18.206 --> 1:23:19.249
OK.

1:23:26.756 --> 1:23:27.799
No.

1:23:35.223 --> 1:23:37.642
I am not old enough
to be his grandmother!

1:23:39.602 --> 1:23:42.397
I'm old enough to be his mother,
not his grandmother, OK?

1:23:51.281 --> 1:23:53.825
I feel like
I'm going to get attacked again.

1:23:53.908 --> 1:23:56.995
A year ago, I was sitting right
here, in this same exact spot,

1:23:57.078 --> 1:24:00.123
and they were sitting there,
throwing insults at me.

1:24:00.707 --> 1:24:02.834
It's just bringing it all back,
all those...

1:24:02.917 --> 1:24:05.253
How am I supposed to be happy
about them being here

1:24:05.337 --> 1:24:09.049
when all I can remember
is them throwing insults at me

1:24:09.132 --> 1:24:12.344
and being so mean and
here they are, starting it again.

1:24:49.047 --> 1:24:50.215
I've had enough.

1:24:50.757 --> 1:24:52.842
This is absolutely ridiculous.

1:24:54.427 --> 1:24:56.846
I allowed myself
to get my hopes up and...

1:24:57.347 --> 1:24:59.432
I was hoping for change.

1:25:01.226 --> 1:25:04.979
But this is the worst-case scenario
for this visit happening right now.

1:25:05.063 --> 1:25:07.399
Everything is going
exactly as I knew it would.

1:25:07.482 --> 1:25:09.567
And I need them to go home.

1:25:09.651 --> 1:25:11.528
I'm gonna lose my (BLEEP).

1:25:11.611 --> 1:25:14.322
There's no convincing these people.

1:25:14.406 --> 1:25:16.408
There's no getting them
to understand.

1:25:16.491 --> 1:25:18.702
Their mind
is just set and that's it.

1:25:54.612 --> 1:25:56.698
How are you?
Good.

1:25:57.490 --> 1:26:01.077
Evelin has agreed
to do couples therapy.

1:26:02.370 --> 1:26:04.372
Um...

1:26:04.456 --> 1:26:07.375
Well, let's go,
if you're ready then, I guess. Yeah.

1:26:07.459 --> 1:26:09.836
I think therapy
will be helpful for us.

1:26:09.919 --> 1:26:13.048
Well, I actually don't know if
it'll be helpful for us, but I...

1:26:13.131 --> 1:26:16.801
It's a step in the right direction
and it shows

1:26:16.885 --> 1:26:20.513
that Evelin wants to do something
to make the relationship work.

1:26:23.099 --> 1:26:25.185
Hi.
Hi, guys. Hi.

1:26:27.103 --> 1:26:29.647
Thank you so much for allowing
me to...

1:26:29.731 --> 1:26:33.818
be here in the outdoors
so we don't have to wear masks.

1:26:33.902 --> 1:26:36.321
Thank you. Yeah.
We'll feel more comfortable.

1:26:36.404 --> 1:26:39.157
I understand you guys got married.
Yeah.

1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:41.326
And you were planning
a wedding party.

1:26:41.409 --> 1:26:43.953
And now you're talking
about divorce.

1:26:44.037 --> 1:26:45.205
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

1:26:45.288 --> 1:26:47.624
Kind of confusing a little bit,
I guess. Yeah.

1:26:47.707 --> 1:26:51.086
You are here because
you want the relationship to work.

1:26:51.169 --> 1:26:53.254
Correct?
Yeah. Eh...

1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:55.131
What is that?

1:26:55.215 --> 1:26:58.968
Well, it's mostly because I've
been trying to push this divorce.

1:26:59.052 --> 1:27:00.970
Because when he married me,

1:27:01.054 --> 1:27:05.809
it's like he felt like he didn't
have to put any effort any more

1:27:05.892 --> 1:27:07.894
and the relationship
started going down.

1:27:07.977 --> 1:27:10.689
So we had a break,
and during that break,

1:27:10.772 --> 1:27:14.067
he was hanging out with some
(BLEEP). I'm sorry, my language.

1:27:14.150 --> 1:27:19.447
And since I found out what he did,
I just have no trust.

1:27:20.949 --> 1:27:24.202
And I don't want to be
in a relationship that is that way.

1:27:24.911 --> 1:27:28.373
I do feel very bad for...
you know what...

1:27:29.290 --> 1:27:30.959
you know, the mistakes I've made.

1:27:31.042 --> 1:27:34.212
I really want to work through
everything that's happened,

1:27:34.295 --> 1:27:36.297
but she's not giving me
that opportunity.

1:27:36.381 --> 1:27:41.594
I feel like she's not able
to forgive and forget anything.

1:27:41.678 --> 1:27:43.471
I never forgive anybody.

1:27:43.555 --> 1:27:46.975
I don't. I'm the kind of person
that if somebody does me wrong,

1:27:47.058 --> 1:27:48.518
I'm like, "Forget about it".

1:27:48.601 --> 1:27:51.521
And I never trust again
and I cut ties immediately.

1:27:51.604 --> 1:27:53.815
OK. So let me explain
something to you. Yeah.

1:27:53.898 --> 1:27:56.526
This is just like a mini class.
Right?

1:27:56.609 --> 1:28:00.697
So there are a lot of couples
who go through infidelity issues.

1:28:00.780 --> 1:28:04.868
Right? So at the end of the day,

1:28:04.951 --> 1:28:09.539
most of those couples
are able to pass through that

1:28:09.622 --> 1:28:12.792
and have an even better
relationship. Right?

1:28:12.876 --> 1:28:15.712
But that only happens
when you're both committed

1:28:15.795 --> 1:28:19.591
and you both are willing
and wanting to do the work.

1:28:21.009 --> 1:28:23.762
Evelin, I totally get
where you're coming from,

1:28:23.845 --> 1:28:26.931
but I'm also kind of curious
about...

1:28:27.015 --> 1:28:30.602
It seems to me you're holding a
lot of anger and resentment. Yeah.

1:28:30.685 --> 1:28:33.980
Right.
But while you are holding that,

1:28:34.064 --> 1:28:36.858
you cannot move forward
with the relationship. Yeah.

1:28:36.941 --> 1:28:39.027
So why can't you let go of this?

1:28:39.110 --> 1:28:43.114
To me, I just feel like
I have been very disrespected.

1:28:43.198 --> 1:28:46.618
And I feel... I don't...
I don't like feeling stupid.

1:28:46.701 --> 1:28:49.537
And I feel like I'm stupid
for ever trusting him.

1:28:50.705 --> 1:28:51.956
You lied to me for months.

1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:55.377
You didn't just hide the truth.
You lied.

1:28:56.002 --> 1:28:59.422
You make... You built
a different story that wasn't true.

1:29:00.465 --> 1:29:05.595
You let me get back into
a relationship based on lies.

1:29:08.348 --> 1:29:10.934
Evelin, what are those tears about?

1:29:12.852 --> 1:29:14.938
I'm just upset.
Why are you upset?

1:29:15.689 --> 1:29:18.733
I never cry because I'm sad.
I cry because I'm upset.

1:29:20.193 --> 1:29:23.655
When we haven't processed
deep things

1:29:23.738 --> 1:29:26.866
that have been very, very hurtful,
that's what happens.

1:29:26.950 --> 1:29:29.452
So your reaction right now
is very normal.

1:29:29.828 --> 1:29:31.913
Tell Corey why you're upset.

1:29:34.207 --> 1:29:37.544
What exactly happened
that makes you so hurt?

1:29:38.753 --> 1:29:40.839
You're doing great.

1:29:45.552 --> 1:29:47.178
Um...

1:29:47.429 --> 1:29:50.390
I wasn't important any more
to you...

1:29:50.974 --> 1:29:53.184
to a point that
I have a car accident

1:29:54.227 --> 1:29:56.438
and you'd rather stay with
a (BLEEP).

1:29:56.771 --> 1:29:58.857
I...

1:30:03.987 --> 1:30:09.159
Some drunk guy was driving and hit
my car and everything got destroyed.

1:30:09.242 --> 1:30:12.871
Luckily, I was OK,
but I was definitely traumatised.

1:30:12.954 --> 1:30:15.040
It was really, really terrifying.

1:30:15.331 --> 1:30:19.753
You knew how bad it was, and
you let me go through that alone.

1:30:34.309 --> 1:30:36.936
When I had my car accident,
you met her

1:30:37.020 --> 1:30:40.690
and you rather stay there instead
of come here and be a support.

1:30:40.774 --> 1:30:44.569
Over the course of like a week or
five days or something like that...

1:30:44.652 --> 1:30:48.156
And of one of those days,
I had met her and it wasn't -

1:30:48.239 --> 1:30:49.824
Do not (BLEEP) lie.

1:30:49.908 --> 1:30:55.080
I saw the... the Instagram stories.
I saw what happened.

1:31:02.879 --> 1:31:06.591
And I heard the woman in it
asking for (BLEEP) wine.

1:31:07.050 --> 1:31:10.178
He was there drinking with her.

1:31:10.637 --> 1:31:13.848
And I say, "Hey, who is
the girl that was there with you?"

1:31:13.932 --> 1:31:16.518
And he say,
"Oh, what girl? There was no girl."

1:31:16.601 --> 1:31:18.395
Already there were lies.

1:31:19.104 --> 1:31:21.564
I asked you and you lied to me.

1:31:21.648 --> 1:31:24.150
And for me to find out
that the same girl that you met

1:31:24.234 --> 1:31:26.111
the day that
I have the car accident...

1:31:29.864 --> 1:31:35.453
For real, I cannot be in a good mood
when I remember this (BLEEP).

1:31:35.537 --> 1:31:37.622
I just can't.

1:31:38.248 --> 1:31:41.292
Even if we were broken up
at that moment,

1:31:41.376 --> 1:31:44.713
on a break or whatever,
we're still married. We still are.

1:31:44.796 --> 1:31:46.715
And I...I agree.

1:31:46.798 --> 1:31:48.967
And I know you think I was
with that girl.

1:31:49.050 --> 1:31:51.136
You met her at that time. I know.

1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:58.810
I want Corey to come clean. Right?

1:31:58.893 --> 1:32:00.645
I know you say you love her.

1:32:00.729 --> 1:32:03.231
But how can you expect her
to trust you

1:32:03.314 --> 1:32:05.525
if you keep
not telling her the truth?

1:32:09.029 --> 1:32:12.365
So you need to look at her
and tell her the absolute truth.

1:32:19.414 --> 1:32:20.874
Um...

1:32:22.042 --> 1:32:27.839
I did meet Jenny
when you were in time of need,

1:32:27.922 --> 1:32:30.842
and I wasn't there for you
and I'm very sorry for that.

1:32:31.926 --> 1:32:35.263
I should've jumped on the first bus
to come back, and I didn't.

1:32:35.347 --> 1:32:37.015
And it was a mistake I made

1:32:37.098 --> 1:32:40.518
and I wish I could go back
and change that.

1:32:42.771 --> 1:32:46.358
I'm telling you right now I'm
sorry for the lies I've given you.

1:32:46.441 --> 1:32:48.485
I am truly sorry.

1:32:50.153 --> 1:32:53.365
Obviously, honesty and...

1:32:53.448 --> 1:32:57.952
you know, trust is very important,
and I... I know that.

1:33:00.997 --> 1:33:03.083
Evelin, how is that for you to hear?

1:33:05.752 --> 1:33:09.089
I don't know
if the word is "nice" or like...

1:33:09.172 --> 1:33:12.258
I don't know.
But it's correct of Corey now...

1:33:21.810 --> 1:33:26.648
And I feel like that gives
me a little bit more of relief.

1:33:26.731 --> 1:33:28.983
That if he gets what the problem is,

1:33:29.734 --> 1:33:32.153
maybe he'll be better
to find absolution.

1:33:35.782 --> 1:33:37.784
The therapist got him
to admit to things

1:33:37.867 --> 1:33:40.495
that I wasn't able
to get him to admit to.

1:33:40.578 --> 1:33:43.832
So yeah, there is something good
out of this couples therapy.

1:33:43.915 --> 1:33:47.002
Maybe, if Corey
admits to these things now,

1:33:47.085 --> 1:33:49.796
I don't have to keep
replaying it in my head

1:33:49.879 --> 1:33:53.091
because I finally
have a legit answer.

1:33:53.425 --> 1:33:56.219
And maybe, maybe, and just maybe

1:33:56.302 --> 1:34:00.140
it's a chance for me to
be able to start moving on from it.

1:34:02.183 --> 1:34:05.603
But it will take time,
is what I believe.

1:34:06.730 --> 1:34:10.066
A lot of couples have
gone through situations like this.

1:34:10.150 --> 1:34:15.613
And it's a process to learn
how to forgive and to regain trust.

1:49:20.727 --> 1:49:20.988
2
00:56:13.280 -- 00:56:16.360 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Let's go down here.
It's kind of slippery. Be careful.

1:53:22.552 --> 1:53:24.804
I'll hold your hand.
OK.

1:53:24.888 --> 1:53:26.973
Ooh!

1:53:27.474 --> 1:53:29.893
Yeah, these stairs
are really slippery.

1:53:51.748 --> 1:53:53.416
Wow. Look how tall that is.

1:53:56.211 --> 1:53:58.380
Let's go sit in the shade
over there.

1:54:52.100 --> 1:54:55.437
I know you're sad
that your mom left.

1:54:56.396 --> 1:55:02.027
And...I just kind of wanted
to ask you how you're feeling.

1:55:02.110 --> 1:55:04.112
How do you think things are going?

1:55:04.195 --> 1:55:05.864
(SIGHS)

1:55:27.469 --> 1:55:30.513
Well, like, we had that
conversation just the other day.

1:55:30.597 --> 1:55:32.682
I feel like I need some time.

1:55:43.818 --> 1:55:49.366
I'm regretting promising Alina that
I'm going to delete my social media,

1:55:49.449 --> 1:55:53.745
because now she's constantly
on my back about it.

1:55:53.828 --> 1:55:56.331
And I feel that
her asking me to delete it

1:55:56.414 --> 1:56:01.544
is coming from a place of insecurity
rather than a place of...

1:56:01.628 --> 1:56:04.547
wanting our relationship
to be in a better place.

1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:14.724
Alina, I do.

1:56:14.808 --> 1:56:16.476
Alina, I do love you.

1:56:21.981 --> 1:56:24.067
I love you.

1:56:31.616 --> 1:56:32.659
Uh...

1:56:42.794 --> 1:56:44.129
Uh...

1:57:08.695 --> 1:57:10.780
You tried setting me up?

1:57:11.531 --> 1:57:13.616
Yes.

1:57:14.325 --> 1:57:17.037
So you don't trust me and you had...

1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.122
you tried to get
one of your friends...

1:57:21.166 --> 1:57:23.251
So that girl, you sent her?

1:57:30.133 --> 1:57:34.929
We didn't really even talk. It was
like two messages, three messages.

1:57:40.602 --> 1:57:42.437
It's offensive
that you don't trust me

1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:45.190
and you would try to set me up
and set me up for failure.

1:57:51.112 --> 1:57:53.948
She messaged me.
You set that whole thing up.

1:57:54.032 --> 1:57:55.825
And you text her back.

1:57:55.909 --> 1:58:00.372
I basically said that well, it'd be
cool if you came and visit us.

1:58:00.455 --> 1:58:03.124
So I asked her
if she had a swimsuit. But like...

1:58:03.208 --> 1:58:04.459
Right.

1:58:04.542 --> 1:58:12.926
So I'm... I didn't... Just a kind
gesture. I don't take it seriously.

1:58:17.972 --> 1:58:20.600
You want me to do it right now?
Yes, right now.

1:58:22.143 --> 1:58:25.647
All right. We can delete it right
now, but I have photos... Yeah.

1:58:25.730 --> 1:58:28.650
..I want to save on there first
before I delete it.

1:58:28.900 --> 1:58:31.569
It'll take a long time
to download all those photos.

1:58:31.653 --> 1:58:32.946
So what?

1:58:33.029 --> 1:58:36.157
Like, this is my graduation picture.

1:58:36.241 --> 1:58:38.618
I don't have that anywhere else,
really.

1:58:40.370 --> 1:58:43.540
We have use this park Wi-Fi.
It's way too hot.

1:58:44.374 --> 1:58:46.459
We can do it when we get home.

1:58:50.088 --> 1:58:53.258
When we get home, we'll save those
pictures, and then I'll delete it.

1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:57.053
OK. Let's do that.

1:59:00.098 --> 1:59:02.183
What? I make you mad?

1:59:04.769 --> 1:59:07.981
Come on, baby. Are you serious?
Like...

1:59:10.900 --> 1:59:11.943
I am -

1:59:14.446 --> 1:59:17.157
I'm being just as serious
as you are.

1:59:21.536 --> 1:59:23.830
Baby. Baby. Baby, baby, baby, babe.

1:59:23.913 --> 1:59:25.999
Baby. Come on.

1:59:26.916 --> 1:59:29.002
I love you. You know that, right?

2:10:11.978 --> 2:10:12.239
2
01:02:48.000 -- 01:02:50.040 align:middle line:90% position:50%
There's no convincing these people.

2:10:37.128 --> 2:10:39.130
There's no getting them
to understand.

2:10:39.214 --> 2:10:41.758
Their mind is just set and that's it.

2:11:43.486 --> 2:11:47.115
What I'm getting out of this
is his parents are trying to put...

2:11:47.198 --> 2:11:50.827
put the blame on society
and take the blame off themselves,

2:11:50.910 --> 2:11:53.329
and say, "Well,
society is not going to accept this

2:11:53.413 --> 2:11:55.165
and they're going to make fun of you,

2:11:55.248 --> 2:11:58.710
and they're going to come up to you
and insult you right to your face",

2:11:58.793 --> 2:12:00.879
when actually it's them.

2:12:01.546 --> 2:12:04.799
They're sitting there,
saying insulting things to me.

2:12:05.091 --> 2:12:06.259
I'm through with it.

2:12:06.343 --> 2:12:08.636
I... I don't...
I'm not going to listen any more.

2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:11.723
I don't want to hear that any more.
I'm done with it.

2:12:12.932 --> 2:12:15.018
You're forgetting why you're here.

2:12:19.981 --> 2:12:24.235
We're supposed to be staying calm
and, let's understand...

2:12:24.819 --> 2:12:26.905
Understand him and I.

2:12:31.117 --> 2:12:32.160
No.

2:12:33.495 --> 2:12:35.205
I would never go in your house

2:12:35.288 --> 2:12:38.291
and start telling you
how to live your life.

2:12:38.375 --> 2:12:42.837
I come in your house and respect you.
So please do the same for me.

2:14:53.677 --> 2:14:55.261
Well, we have been.

2:14:58.264 --> 2:15:04.437
Well, we are doing fine living
by ourselves in our own place.

2:15:05.355 --> 2:15:08.650
We're fine. It's just
a different lifestyle for us.

2:15:41.057 --> 2:15:42.100
OK.

2:15:47.313 --> 2:15:51.985
Is that what you want, though?
You want to go the traditional way?

2:15:56.531 --> 2:16:00.285
You seemed happy living the way
we've been living all this time.

2:16:02.996 --> 2:16:07.083
Sumit tells his family that
it's his dream to all live together.

2:16:07.792 --> 2:16:09.878
And I'm like, "What?

2:16:10.462 --> 2:16:12.464
I didn't know about this dream."

2:16:32.359 --> 2:16:36.321
I have been in a relationship
with Sumit for a long time.

2:16:37.781 --> 2:16:41.326
And not once have
I ever heard him say that,

2:16:41.409 --> 2:16:43.495
"I want to go back
and live with my parents".

2:16:45.747 --> 2:16:48.541
I don't believe him. I don't believe
that that's his dream,

2:16:48.625 --> 2:16:51.336
because I think he's just
trying to please his parents.

2:16:51.419 --> 2:16:53.463
But when it comes down to it,

2:16:54.089 --> 2:16:56.341
he better choose me or them,
and that's it.

2:16:56.424 --> 2:16:59.344
There's no...
I'm not living with his parents.

2:16:59.427 --> 2:17:01.054
Sorry. I'm not doing it.

2:22:18.121 --> 2:22:20.415
Oh, man. (SIGHS)

2:22:22.625 --> 2:22:23.668
Jeez.

2:22:33.136 --> 2:22:35.513
Armando, I just
went down the laundry room

2:22:35.597 --> 2:22:38.266
and the washing machine
would not turn on at all.

2:22:38.350 --> 2:22:41.353
You press the right buttons?
Yes, I pressed the right buttons.

2:22:41.436 --> 2:22:43.897
Well, we should
go to the lavanderia downtown.

2:22:43.980 --> 2:22:46.066
That's fine. Let's go.

2:22:53.740 --> 2:22:56.117
We got a big old laundry basket
in there.

2:23:02.999 --> 2:23:05.085
Good times.

2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:09.839
It's been a few days since
I talked with Madison and Cassidy

2:23:09.923 --> 2:23:12.550
but I've been thinking about
what they said.

2:23:12.842 --> 2:23:15.261
It's up over this hill?
Yeah. Turn right.

2:23:16.471 --> 2:23:19.766
I have not been honest with Armando
about how homesick I really am.

2:23:20.725 --> 2:23:23.436
But I feel I need
to tell him this now,

2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:25.146
especially before we get married.

2:23:25.230 --> 2:23:28.149
I want him to know the truth
about how I'm feeling.

2:23:29.442 --> 2:23:31.528
All right. Is it in Spanish? Oh, no.

2:23:32.153 --> 2:23:34.656
No, it's not.
It's in English. Good for me.

2:23:35.490 --> 2:23:37.409
Let's have a seat.

2:23:37.492 --> 2:23:39.244
On a scale from one to ten,

2:23:39.327 --> 2:23:42.580
it's like a lot of times
I'll be at a three.

2:23:42.664 --> 2:23:46.251
But then there are times
where I'm at a complete ten to 11,

2:23:46.334 --> 2:23:49.963
where I just really wish
I could be there at that moment,

2:23:50.046 --> 2:23:51.297
at that second.

2:23:52.632 --> 2:23:53.675
Um...

2:23:54.592 --> 2:23:57.929
You know, (CLEARS THROAT) I want
to talk to you about something.

2:24:01.349 --> 2:24:05.603
Lately, I've been thinking
a lot more about stuff. Um...

2:24:06.813 --> 2:24:11.067
You know, and now
with Cassidy being pregnant...

2:24:11.151 --> 2:24:15.238
Um... I'm going to be...
honest with you.

2:24:16.489 --> 2:24:17.741
Um...

2:24:18.450 --> 2:24:20.368
I do struggle...

2:24:24.372 --> 2:24:27.208
..because I do miss it there a lot.

2:24:28.752 --> 2:24:35.300
And I'm...really homesick.

2:24:40.347 --> 2:24:42.432
What exactly are you feeling?

2:24:46.353 --> 2:24:49.647
It's hard to say because I just...
Um...

2:24:53.151 --> 2:24:55.945
When Kenny and I started
talking about living together,

2:24:56.029 --> 2:24:58.948
we decided to live here in Mexico
because of Hannah.

2:24:59.032 --> 2:25:02.452
She has my parents.
She has her mother's parents

2:25:02.535 --> 2:25:06.664
that she needs to visit and see
often because of her young age.

2:25:06.748 --> 2:25:11.002
But I know he left a lot,
left his whole life for me.

2:25:11.086 --> 2:25:14.339
And I get it's a big change
and it's a different country.

2:25:15.131 --> 2:25:17.425
You know, there's a lot
he's had to adjust to.

2:25:17.509 --> 2:25:19.511
And that weighs down
a little bit on me

2:25:19.594 --> 2:25:22.222
and obviously makes me
feel a little guilty.

2:25:23.682 --> 2:25:27.227
I understand you're homesick
and that you miss your kids.

2:25:27.310 --> 2:25:31.272
But I hope this isn't something
where, you know...

2:25:32.732 --> 2:25:35.819
..you'd want to go back home
and cancel the wedding or something.

2:25:41.533 --> 2:25:43.618
You're scaring me.

2:25:49.416 --> 2:25:51.501
It's not like that.

2:25:52.085 --> 2:25:54.462
I just... I'm just trying
to be upfront with you.

2:25:54.546 --> 2:25:58.174
Like, I do struggle sometimes
just with missing everything.

2:26:00.176 --> 2:26:02.262
And I'm missing out on a lot.

2:26:02.762 --> 2:26:07.934
And you know, I talked with the
girls and I feel like, you know,

2:26:08.018 --> 2:26:09.811
I let them down in a lot of ways.

2:26:10.770 --> 2:26:12.355
I let Cooper down in a lot of ways.

2:26:12.439 --> 2:26:14.149
I feel like I'm letting Cassidy down

2:26:14.232 --> 2:26:17.819
because I'm not there
for her during this pregnancy.

2:26:20.447 --> 2:26:21.906
Are you going to cry?

2:26:22.782 --> 2:26:24.868
I just... I don't know. I just...

2:26:26.870 --> 2:26:29.789
I don't want to hurt them and
that has never been my intention,

2:26:29.873 --> 2:26:31.958
and I love them a lot.

2:26:33.793 --> 2:26:35.879
And I know it's hard on them.

2:26:36.671 --> 2:26:39.883
I know it's hard on them to not
have you and I feel it through them,

2:26:39.966 --> 2:26:42.052
and I just hope
that they understand that

2:26:42.135 --> 2:26:45.972
and that they don't
not like me because of that.

2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:01.196
Don't go there in your mind,
because it's not that at all.

2:27:01.780 --> 2:27:05.867
I'm just trying to say that I...
I've been keeping things in.

2:27:05.950 --> 2:27:09.412
And I want to be honest with you
and let things out when I need to

2:27:09.496 --> 2:27:12.874
because it kind of
might be affecting me.

2:27:13.416 --> 2:27:15.627
It's not only you
that's dealing with it.

2:27:15.710 --> 2:27:20.382
But ultimately, me as your partner,
I can be there for you.

2:27:23.093 --> 2:27:25.178
Kenny and I have always
prided ourselves

2:27:25.261 --> 2:27:27.013
on being honest with each other.

2:27:27.097 --> 2:27:30.100
We've agreed on
saying everything we're feeling.

2:27:32.519 --> 2:27:34.354
So the fact
that we're going to marry

2:27:34.437 --> 2:27:37.691
and he's keeping feelings from me
is worrisome.

2:27:38.316 --> 2:27:41.986
Because I question now,
will he want to go back home?

2:27:46.533 --> 2:27:48.368
I didn't know
he missed it this much.

2:45:37.020 --> 2:45:37.281

01:21:49.160 -- 01:21:51.440 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Day one of Sumit's parents
in our house

2:48:09.798 --> 2:48:12.217
and I'm already ready for them
to go home.

2:48:13.343 --> 2:48:16.388
I actually happen
to like my kitchen the way I had it.

2:48:17.639 --> 2:48:19.641
They've come here.
They've attacked me

2:48:19.724 --> 2:48:23.687
and they insult me
and they're just not nice to me.

2:48:23.770 --> 2:48:25.146
It's very hurtful.

2:48:26.773 --> 2:48:30.777
And the thing that bothers me the
most is Sumit telling his parents

2:48:30.860 --> 2:48:33.655
that it's his dream
for us all to live together.

2:48:34.280 --> 2:48:36.366
Now, I've never heard
of this dream before.

2:48:41.788 --> 2:48:44.082
Well, how do you think that went?

2:48:44.165 --> 2:48:47.544
I don't think it went very well at
all. I think they didn't come here

2:48:47.627 --> 2:48:50.088
with the intention
they said they were coming here.

2:48:51.423 --> 2:48:54.634
And exactly what happened
is exactly what I expected.

2:48:57.554 --> 2:49:01.307
And please don't say it's your dream
to go live with your parents.

2:49:08.273 --> 2:49:09.649
But why?

2:49:15.822 --> 2:49:19.784
But you're 33 years old. You should
be OK not being with your parents.

2:50:16.675 --> 2:50:18.760
Do you think that that will happen?

2:50:25.225 --> 2:50:29.646
No. I seriously don't see
your mom moving past this.

2:50:36.945 --> 2:50:40.532
I was under the impression that Sumit
was not happy living with his parents

2:50:40.615 --> 2:50:42.450
and wanted to get out of there.

2:50:42.534 --> 2:50:44.536
Long distance for all those years,

2:50:44.619 --> 2:50:48.665
we had a lot of time to discuss
what our life would be like,

2:50:48.748 --> 2:50:52.127
and it never included
living with his parents.

2:50:52.669 --> 2:50:55.296
What's wrong with our life
the way that it is?

2:50:56.339 --> 2:50:59.926
You're free to live your life,
be independent, do what you want,

2:51:00.010 --> 2:51:01.511
live the way you want to live.

2:51:01.594 --> 2:51:04.014
You can't do that
at your parents' house.

2:51:04.347 --> 2:51:06.975
You want to go back
to that kind of lifestyle?

2:51:13.273 --> 2:51:14.941
Everything is not gonna be fine. OK?

2:51:17.944 --> 2:51:19.195
God.

2:51:27.954 --> 2:51:31.082
I would never want to live
with my parents at your age.

2:51:34.461 --> 2:51:37.672
We're in our room arguing, and
his parents are one bedroom over.

2:51:37.756 --> 2:51:41.634
And I'm pretty sure that this is
exactly what they wanted to happen.

2:51:52.687 --> 2:51:54.397
I don't feel their love at all.

2:51:54.481 --> 2:51:57.400
I feel like they would
love to just get rid of me

2:51:57.484 --> 2:51:59.319
and have their son back.

2:52:00.737 --> 2:52:03.615
They're pretending for you
that they're going to try,

2:52:03.698 --> 2:52:05.784
but I don't really believe that.

2:52:07.285 --> 2:52:09.245
But as far as living with them...

2:52:11.790 --> 2:52:15.001
Yeah, I don't think
that's going to happen.

2:52:25.428 --> 2:52:27.764
Next time on 90 Day Fiance:
The Other way.

2:52:27.847 --> 2:52:30.350
I hate that I have to be
without you.

2:52:31.643 --> 2:52:33.353
Hasn't it been long enough?

2:52:35.605 --> 2:52:38.233
I really want a sunset wedding.

2:52:40.819 --> 2:52:43.655
The sunset was like just
the one thing I was like wanting.

2:52:43.738 --> 2:52:45.824
But if it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

2:52:47.242 --> 2:52:50.620
You kind of like
immediately sided with them.

2:52:50.704 --> 2:52:52.914
Baby, because it was talking
about time.

2:52:52.997 --> 2:52:55.709
I don't think
you understand what I'm saying.

2:53:13.643 --> 2:53:16.771
I've decided I'm...
I'm not coming back to Ethiopia.

2:53:19.691 --> 2:53:21.401
Let me tell you something, Biniyam.

2:53:21.484 --> 2:53:23.570
Shut up. Shut the (BLEEP) up.

2:53:24.070 --> 2:53:27.115
God knows who you (BLEEP) and
God knows what you've been doing.

2:53:27.198 --> 2:53:29.284
This is a chance for you
to redeem yourself.

2:53:29.367 --> 2:53:30.952
This is your last (BLEEP) chance.

2:53:33.121 --> 2:53:34.873
These clothes are so wet.

2:53:39.836 --> 2:53:43.214
Why do you have to be a (BLEEP)
to me all the time?

2:53:43.465 --> 2:53:47.719
Right now, Victor and I's
relationship is a little stressed.

2:53:47.802 --> 2:53:50.221
He can be a total asshole.

2:53:50.305 --> 2:53:53.433
I'm really having
a lot of second thoughts right now.

2:53:55.393 --> 2:53:57.187
I want to make things
work with you.

2:54:10.033 --> 2:54:12.118
