WEBVTT

00:17.600 --> 00:18.643
Happy birthday, Mom.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.483
Make a wish.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.445
[female voice] Jack Morton?

00:28.903 --> 00:32.282
We discussed this, Vera.
Jack Morton isn't Order material.

00:33.158 --> 00:37.996
Based on his academic achievements alone,
I'd argue he's one of our best candidates.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.999
He can't even afford
Belgrave's tuition fees.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.378
Well, some of our brightest stars
came from similar backgrounds.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.047
I got the letter from Belgrave.

00:49.007 --> 00:49.966
Thin.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.343
Bad sign.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.516
-The boy's a delinquent.
-He's student council president.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.226
-An orphan.
-A track and field champion.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.438
-A loner.
-Because popularity is so important.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.689
More than you'll ever know.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.780
[sighs]
[clears throat]

01:11.863 --> 01:13.073
"Dear, Mr. Morton..."

01:13.156 --> 01:14.407
The matter's closed.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.202
I've already put him out of his misery.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.954
[Vera] If Jack Morton isn't a student,
he can't pledge.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.625
This university is my jurisdiction.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.585
[Vera]
A privilege we may have to reconsider.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.256
The Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose
has standards,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.634
and Jack Morton doesn't measure up.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.722
"Thank you for your application
to Belgrave University.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.682
We regret to inform you..."

01:46.189 --> 01:47.065
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.359
I did everything I could.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.236
[clunk]

02:05.625 --> 02:06.876
[speaking in Latin]

02:15.385 --> 02:16.386
Weird.

02:17.428 --> 02:20.640
"We are pleased to inform you that
you've been selected for the admission

02:20.723 --> 02:24.144
to the Belgrave class of... 2023.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.479
Full scholarship.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.606
Living allowance." Mom, I...

02:29.357 --> 02:30.275
I got in!

02:30.817 --> 02:33.736
I got in! Fucking A! Ha ha!

02:37.157 --> 02:38.449
I'm sorry for your loss.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.055
[doors bang shut]

03:14.527 --> 03:17.739
[crossing bell rings]

03:17.822 --> 03:22.118
[honk of train]
[rush of wheels]

03:45.516 --> 03:49.312
[male voice]
Jack! Wakey wakey, hands off snakey!

03:51.731 --> 03:52.941
Holy shit.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.651
It's alive.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.153
-Good morning, Pops.
-How long you been up?

03:57.654 --> 03:58.529
Not long.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.449
You know,
you don't have to move to campus.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.159
It's an easy commute from here.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.246
Residency is part of the deal.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.581
Besides, I figured you could use my room
as your office.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.041
Uh? Huh.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.751
What the hell do I need an office for?

04:12.043 --> 04:13.920
I don't know. Office stuff.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.757
-The garage gets cold in the winter.
-The cold keeps me focused.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.019
Hey, you got everything?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.105
-Have you got everything?
-Yeah.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.360
No.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.237
-Keys.
-Keys.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.332
I know they're in here somewhere.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.712
Oh, God. Where did I leave them?

04:55.962 --> 04:57.297
This is really weird

04:59.632 --> 05:01.092
-Hey, Pops.
-Yeah.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.593
Ah!

05:02.677 --> 05:04.762
Thank you! I told you they were here.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.184
And as for Belgrave's  favorite son...

05:11.227 --> 05:12.186
Fuck you, Edward.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.855
My daughter is dead because of you.

05:13.938 --> 05:14.772
EDWARD COVENTRY

05:14.856 --> 05:16.607
TURNING MEDICAL PHILANTHROPY ON ITS HEAD

05:16.858 --> 05:18.276
Fuck you, Dad.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.485
We're coming for you.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.745
[sound of church bells]

05:41.299 --> 05:43.551
Ah. I can get you closer.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
It's all good.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.271
What's the matter?
Don't want your crazy grandfather

05:55.355 --> 05:57.607
scaring all those one percenter parasites?

05:57.690 --> 05:58.775
Basically.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.861
Makes sense, I guess.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.154
[Jack sighs]

06:03.696 --> 06:06.824
[Pops] Look at it, kid.
The plan's all coming together.

06:07.367 --> 06:11.287
Your mother would be so proud.
All your hard work's paid off.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.956
You got into Belgrave.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.586
-You're gonna get pledged.
-Maybe.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.215
Think positive, champ. The Blue Rose
would be crazy not to take you.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.760
Put yourself out there,
make yourself available.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.178
Make people notice you.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.764
And don't take no for an answer.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.309
All incredibly disturbing advice.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.186
Er, it's advice.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.646
[Jack laughs]

06:40.483 --> 06:42.568
Look, Pops, you know I'm gonna...

06:44.612 --> 06:45.488
Yeah.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.286
See you for dinner Sunday?

06:52.703 --> 06:53.538
Of course.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.455
Okay.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.339
Go get 'em.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.221
You get pledged,

07:10.304 --> 07:13.599
-we get that motherfucker.
-Way to keep it on the down-low, Pops.

07:13.724 --> 07:14.892
[laughs]

07:24.944 --> 07:26.070
He'll be fine.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.532
[Jack] No, no!

07:35.663 --> 07:36.664
[male voice] The fire

07:37.123 --> 07:40.251
represents our undying bond
of brotherhood.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.633
The sword represents strength.

07:51.762 --> 07:52.680
Ah!

07:53.097 --> 07:53.931
Ow!

07:54.265 --> 07:55.099
Shit.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.522
Ow. Oh, shit.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.533
Blood unifies us.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.869
It makes us one.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.706
Now, drink from the goblet

08:19.373 --> 08:21.876
and commit your life to

08:22.668 --> 08:23.794
the...

08:25.171 --> 08:26.005
To the...

08:27.173 --> 08:28.216
Dude, come on.

08:30.968 --> 08:35.264
To the Fraternal Brotherhood
of Sigma Sigma Delta.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.520
Er, no.

08:41.896 --> 08:42.772
Thanks, though.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.444
If it's the blood, I'm totally clean.

08:49.028 --> 08:52.365
I mean, I had hep C
after a trip to Mexico,

08:52.949 --> 08:55.326
-but that's all cleared up now.
-It's not the blood.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.454
It's the robes.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.164
Isn't it?

09:00.248 --> 09:02.667
I keep telling the National Charter
we want to ditch this crap,

09:02.750 --> 09:05.711
but they keep telling us it's tradition.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.797
No! No, the robes are...

09:08.256 --> 09:10.758
are fine.
They give you a sense of dignity.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.468
Then what the fuck, Morton?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.179
We've been tracking you
since you won that scholarship.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.139
Your bona fides are sick.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.269
-You're textbook Delta material.
-Look...

09:21.978 --> 09:23.020
-Dale.
-Dale.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.356
I appreciate it. I do.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.234
It's not you.

09:28.943 --> 09:29.777
It's me.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.572
I'm holding out for another organization.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.325
[whispered voice]
Hey, man, what are you doing?

09:38.744 --> 09:40.371
Can I just get my stuff back?

09:40.746 --> 09:44.667
Okay, house rules.
If I catch you breaking them,

09:44.875 --> 09:47.837
-I got a report you, so...
-Don't break any rules.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.089
Don't let me catch you, that's right.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.675
Pants on, Clay.  We're coming in.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.971
Jack Morton, Clayton Turner.

09:58.014 --> 09:58.848
Hey.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.770
Have you ever wondered why you exist?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.188
Not really.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.776
Of course not. All you can see
is the carrot they want you to chase.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.487
A good job, a loving wife,

10:13.863 --> 10:15.740
the kids, the summer house,

10:15.823 --> 10:17.283
credit cards, the debt.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.620
They want you to be a cog
in their system.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.331
And then, just like that...

10:23.414 --> 10:24.248
[click]

10:25.583 --> 10:26.584
you're dead.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.257
There's so much to experience,
so much to taste.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.052
Don't let someone else define you.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.012
Don't waste this opportunity.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.472
Don't...

10:40.556 --> 10:42.058
touch my shit.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.102
Also, nice to meet you.

10:48.689 --> 10:49.607
Yeah, you, too.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.077
Any questions
about changing roommates? No?

11:01.702 --> 11:02.536
Great.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.831
You lose your key.
It's 75 bucks to replace it.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.126
Here is your welcome package.
It's got your map of campus,

11:09.210 --> 11:12.672
complete with all male, female,
and non-binary bathroom locations.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.424
There's a bunch of coupons
for stuff you'll never buy.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.594
There is a rape whistle
and a "How Not to Rape" pamphlet.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.263
-Any questions?
-Nope.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.266
But if you need a hand with anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.102
I think I'm supposed to say that.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.025
-Is that a...?
-[door bangs]

11:43.244 --> 11:46.539
Hey. Weston, right?
Jack Morton, I'm your neighbor..

11:46.622 --> 11:48.708
-What's up?
-Lucky you.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.418
-And you're Gregory.
-Yeah. So?

11:50.501 --> 11:53.170
That's what I was thinking.
Hey, congratulations.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.714
Okay.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.384
-Thank you, I guess.
-You know, the blue rose.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.303
Were you expecting the pledge
or was it a surprise?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.640
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yeah, I got it.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.184
But if you were pledged
by a secret society,

12:07.268 --> 12:09.645
would it be your academic record
that got you noticed?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.731
I'd say you sound like a fucking idiot
right now.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.648
[thump]

12:13.399 --> 12:15.901
-Are you a legacy?
-Dude, back the fuck off, okay?

12:15.985 --> 12:18.487
-Just asking a question.
-You ask too many fucking questions!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.156
I don't want any trouble. Okay?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.199
Too late.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.117
[swipe]

12:24.034 --> 12:25.202
-[thump]
-[grunts]

12:26.912 --> 12:28.330
[thump]
-[thud]

12:28.414 --> 12:29.623
Whoa, hey, hey, dick!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.709
You do not want to be second man in.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.046
God, I love the smell of testosterone
in the morning.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.550
It smells like... stupidity.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.093
I... ah.

12:42.428 --> 12:46.766
It's just a misunderstanding,
for which I apologize. Are we good?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.351
Fucking good, man.

12:49.894 --> 12:50.770
See you later.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.688
[Weston] Jesus!

12:53.314 --> 12:56.066
-You literally stood there. I was get--
-[Gregory] Man, I tried--

12:56.150 --> 12:58.277
They say college is where you meet
your true friends.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.071
Apparently, it's also where you meet
your best enemies.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.281
[Jack] Sorry about that.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.074
I'm Jack.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.243
Ah, hi, Jack.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.580
I'm just trying to give a tour, so...

13:09.955 --> 13:11.207
-Right.
-Yeah.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.669
Okay. Well, welcome, everyone,

13:15.753 --> 13:19.089
and congratulations on your acceptance
to Belgrave University.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.467
I'm Alyssa Drake
and I'll be your tour guide today.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.261
Sitting on over 500 acres of land,

13:24.345 --> 13:27.765
Belgrave University is considered by many
to be a city within a city.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.391
It's hard to believe that at one time

13:29.475 --> 13:31.852
the university consisted
of a single building,

13:31.936 --> 13:33.813
and this whole area was farmland,

13:33.896 --> 13:36.148
providing the vegetables
for the school's cafeteria.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.359
[laughs]

13:38.609 --> 13:41.946
Look at that.
We have a question... already.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.573
I thought they didn't have a garden
until the second World War.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.496
You are correct.

13:50.746 --> 13:54.124
It was a victory garden tended by
the agricultural students.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.043
And before that it was a forest,
wasn't it?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.045
Would you like to guide this tour?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.464
Sure.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.511
Er...
[sighs]

14:09.098 --> 14:10.224
Ethan Belgrave,

14:10.891 --> 14:13.227
the university's namesake and benefactor,

14:13.310 --> 14:16.647
made his fortune as a privateer
in the continental Navy,

14:17.189 --> 14:21.151
which makes us the only university ever
to be founded by a pirate.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.531
Come on.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.242
More fun stuff this way.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.663
How did he even know that?

14:34.373 --> 14:36.417
[Jack] This way. Catch up.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.005
Now, behind me is Belgrave Hall,

14:41.422 --> 14:44.508
which is both the oldest
and most haunted building on campus.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.052
There have been eight different ghosts
spotted here.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.596
But the one to watch out for

14:49.346 --> 14:50.681
is the Screaming Lady.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.765
Screaming Lady?

14:53.976 --> 14:55.769
Yeah, the Sreaming Lady,

14:55.853 --> 14:58.355
murdered right here over 200 years ago.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.775
Her ghost still wanders the Hall,

15:01.859 --> 15:04.445
screaming, "Bloody murder,"
looking for her killer.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.118
Now, for those of you who can read,

15:11.660 --> 15:13.495
the library is this way.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.667
Who is this idiot?

15:20.961 --> 15:22.504
[Alyssa] I can take it from here.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.385
[Alyssa] Okay.
The McGrath Reference Library

15:28.469 --> 15:32.723
is home to the world's largest collection
of anthropodermic bibliopegy,

15:32.806 --> 15:34.725
books bound in human flesh.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.060
[gasps]

15:36.143 --> 15:37.978
[animated chatter]

15:39.271 --> 15:40.898
[student] Just a sec. Er...

15:41.398 --> 15:42.608
-[Alyssa] And--
-[Jack] Also...

15:43.984 --> 15:47.655
it is believed to be the home of Belgrave
University's own secret society,

15:47.780 --> 15:49.365
the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.618
Some say that there's a temple
hidden in the basement.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.537
Past members include presidents,
captains of industry,

15:55.621 --> 15:57.539
and more than one celebrity.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.834
Come on.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.591
[Jack] And that is why
the Albrecht Chemistry Department

16:07.675 --> 16:10.260
has most student pregnancies
per department.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.679
[giggles]

16:11.762 --> 16:13.806
And that brings us back
to where we started,

16:14.348 --> 16:15.474
concluding our tour.

16:15.891 --> 16:20.396
[applause]

16:22.564 --> 16:23.399
[Alyssa laughs]

16:23.816 --> 16:26.527
-Where did you learn all that?
-My grandfather used to work here,

16:26.610 --> 16:28.612
and he's a bit of a Belgrave completist.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.991
Yeah, that was kind of impressive.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.326
Impressive enough
to let me buy you dinner?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.036
[laughs]

16:36.245 --> 16:39.123
[male voice] Man!
Will you two sleep together already?

16:39.206 --> 16:43.127
Everyone on campus is talking.
You're like the Jim and Pam of Belgrave.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.212
Hi. Randall Carpio.  And you are?

16:45.879 --> 16:46.839
Leaving.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.716
By the way,

16:48.799 --> 16:52.636
everyone knows The Order is fake news.
The library doesn't even have a basement.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.599
Ouch! Architecture burn!

16:59.476 --> 17:01.645
Come on. Let's grab a beer.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.819
You're over 21, right?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.114
Kidding! I don't give a shit.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.824
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

17:13.907 --> 17:14.783
[glasses chink]

17:16.910 --> 17:17.745
Look, man,

17:18.370 --> 17:22.082
I wouldn't take her rejection too hard.
You never stood a chance.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.544
She would have bailed the second
she saw your Star Wars bed sheets.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.296
I'm not interested in her.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.844
You into him or her? Or the other him?

17:33.969 --> 17:34.970
Ouch!

17:37.806 --> 17:40.100
What do you know about
the Hermetic Order of The Blue Rose?

17:43.520 --> 17:45.272
It's a crock of shit.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.024
[Jack clears throat]

17:47.107 --> 17:48.609
I think they may have been recruited,

17:48.692 --> 17:50.819
and I'm trying to figure out
what they have in common.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.738
Besides being...

17:53.238 --> 17:55.157
elitist assholes? Hi.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.203
Hey, a lot of good people are members.
Michelle Obama, Warren Buffett, Oprah.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.789
You know who's also
supposed to be members?

18:01.872 --> 18:06.001
Bad people, like Benito Mussolini,
George W. Bush.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.377
Oprah.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.963
For someone that doesn't believe,
you sure know a lot about them.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.174
I'm Wikipedia smart.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.260
Look, even if they do exist...

18:15.803 --> 18:17.429
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.681
-Why is that?
-They want sheep.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.351
You've got a mind of your own.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.394
[Jack] Yeah.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.523
Well, who wouldn't want unlimited power?

18:29.566 --> 18:30.609
Thanks for the beer.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.111
See you around.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.364
[Randall] Sounds good.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.093
[snapping of twigs]

18:57.886 --> 19:00.264
[buzzing of flies]

19:00.806 --> 19:01.640
Hello?

19:07.646 --> 19:08.605
Whatever.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.947
-[snarls]
-[Weston yells]

19:25.289 --> 19:26.540
Mr. Morton.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.167
Chancellor Stone.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.461
Detective Hayashi here
has some questions for you.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.341
This is the part where you open the door
and let us in.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.889
[Jack] Weston's dead?

19:42.556 --> 19:43.765
When? How did it happen?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.559
I'll ask the questions, all right?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.562
Weston file a complaint against you.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.689
He said you attacked him.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.233
[Jack] No, he attacked me.
I was defending myself.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.694
-Can you prove that?
-Check YouTube.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.364
Are there any real people
who can verify your story?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.074
Alyssa Drake.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.410
She was there.
She was leading an orientation tour.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.079
Will that be all, Detective?

20:07.831 --> 20:10.918
Well, I will need to question the alibi,
Chancellor.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.544
If you don't mind.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.963
Of course. Belgrave is at your disposal.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.091
That's a refreshing change.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.637
Mr. Morton...

20:22.721 --> 20:25.349
if you think of anything else,
don't hesitate to call.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.768
I'll find my own way out.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.234
[door shuts]

20:39.988 --> 20:42.241
Receiving a scholarship

20:42.699 --> 20:44.368
to Belgrave is no small feat.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.956
I hope you're not planning to major
in self-sabotage.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.417
-I told you I was defending myself.
-You're also enjoying yourself.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.835
I saw the video.

20:55.045 --> 20:59.967
Believe it or not,
I am sympathetic to your situation, but...

21:00.801 --> 21:03.178
violence between students
cannot be tolerated.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.974
So, consider this your one and only
get out of jail free card.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.977
And that card expires after orientation.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.280
[Jack sighs]

21:36.086 --> 21:37.671
DUSK, KNEEBEND TRAIL

21:42.259 --> 21:44.469
[Gregory]
Kneebend Trail. I mean, this is it, right?

21:44.553 --> 21:47.055
-[male] It should be.
-You guys think I got time to go pee?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.141
-[female] No.
-[male] No, just hold on.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.269
You have got to be kidding me.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.523
[male] Ignore them.
They all went to Prescott Academy.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.151
You know what they say
about Prescott students?

21:59.234 --> 22:01.111
Yeah. They're a bunch of pampered douches.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.822
No, but that is pretty accurate.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.699
-I'm Amir.
-Jack.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.577
-So, I miss anything?
-[male voice] Silence!

22:10.078 --> 22:10.912
Like that?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.583
Subservience.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.210
Observance.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.130
You are no longer students.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.092
You are Neophytes.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.720
Less than nothing.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.181
Seven are summoned,

22:29.890 --> 22:31.641
three will be selected.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.396
Find the coin.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.609
Take more than one, and we will know.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.235
[chink of metal]

22:44.696 --> 22:46.656
Reveal the location to the others...

22:46.740 --> 22:47.699
[chink of metal]

22:47.783 --> 22:48.658
and we will know.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.828
[female voice]
Find the coins by night five.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.915
You have 24 hours.

22:57.042 --> 22:57.876
Alyssa?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.384
BLADE & CHALICE

23:05.467 --> 23:08.261
I'm confused. Do we have 24 hours
or five nights?

23:08.345 --> 23:10.305
That was a clue, Brandon.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.349
Five nights is a clue.

23:12.432 --> 23:15.352
-She said "night five," not "five nights."
-What's the difference?

23:15.435 --> 23:17.646
He also said we're not supposed
to help each other.

23:17.729 --> 23:22.025
No. He said we're not allowed to reveal
the location or take more than one.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.611
He never said we couldn't work together
to decipher the clue.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.655
-Sounds good to me.
-Why should we trust you?

23:27.364 --> 23:29.491
'Cause I'm a legacy. I'm already in.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.120
I'm not taking any chances.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.582
Well, if I were you,

23:37.666 --> 23:40.919
I'd be doing everything in my power
to make sure that townie doesn't get in.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.463
Sweet. Like an alliance.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.674
Yeah. Just like one.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.344
[lecturer] Introduction to Ethics.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.930
Such a strange name for a class.

23:52.013 --> 23:52.973
I mean,

23:53.432 --> 23:56.017
if I have to introduce you
to the concept of ethics,

23:56.101 --> 23:58.979
what the hell have your parents been doing
for the past 18 years?

23:59.187 --> 24:01.648
[Jack, quietly]
Find the coins by night five.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.234
Now, normally...

24:05.652 --> 24:08.029
I'd ease you in to the class,

24:08.238 --> 24:09.823
look over the syllabus...

24:11.116 --> 24:13.577
I'd tell you what syllabus means,
but today...

24:15.829 --> 24:17.497
Oh, today we're starting out...

24:18.498 --> 24:20.542
in the shadow of a tragedy. Yes?

24:21.376 --> 24:23.378
[student] Can we not talk about that?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.297
Why? Why shouldn't we discuss it?

24:25.422 --> 24:27.382
[student]
Because every time I think about him,

24:27.466 --> 24:30.760
I remember how I thought about going
for a walk down that same trail.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.639
And if I had a gone at that time,
on that day...

24:37.517 --> 24:38.810
it could've been me.

24:39.102 --> 24:39.936
Mm-hm.

24:40.937 --> 24:41.855
And you feel relieved.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.691
That's not what I meant.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.027
No, listen. It's okay if you are.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.404
I mean, look,
I was on that trail yesterday.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.324
-I'm glad it wasn't me.
-That's selfish.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.910
Of course it's selfish.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.747
I can't think of anything more selfish
than wanting to stay alive.

24:59.956 --> 25:02.042
Except trying to make yourself
the center of attention.

25:02.125 --> 25:02.959
[giggles]

25:03.043 --> 25:04.461
But let me ask you this.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.922
Is self-preservation...

25:08.298 --> 25:09.174
unethical?

25:09.633 --> 25:11.801
I'm not trying to make myself
the center of attention,

25:11.885 --> 25:14.846
but Wendell's death
is very upsetting to me.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.307
And it's making me realize
how much I want to live my life.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.101
-Weston.
-Who?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.646
Dead friend, his name's Weston,
not Wendell.

25:22.729 --> 25:23.980
[suppressed giggles]

25:24.064 --> 25:24.898
You.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.399
Hey, notebook.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.318
How do you feel?

25:32.948 --> 25:33.949
A little guilty.

25:34.032 --> 25:34.866
Hm.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.369
Why?

25:38.286 --> 25:40.038
I feel like I'm benefiting from it.

25:41.122 --> 25:44.251
You feel like his death
created an opportunity for you.

25:45.001 --> 25:45.961
I think so, yes.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.463
-He's a vulture.
-[lecturer] No, he's honest.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.634
He's also not trying to pawn up
his narcissism as remorse.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.595
And for those of you who don't know...

25:56.221 --> 25:57.055
honesty

25:57.264 --> 25:59.516
is actually a cornerstone
of ethics.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.563
Imagine how well you're gonna do
if you actually pay attention.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.823
[sighs]

26:16.324 --> 26:18.577
[stone clunks back]

26:18.994 --> 26:19.911
Damn it.

26:23.039 --> 26:25.584
Better have a good reason
for ripping up my chessboard.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.711
I doubt you'd believe me if I told you.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.505
Oh, actually you might.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.718
[stones clunk]

26:40.599 --> 26:41.433
You wanna do this?

26:48.023 --> 26:48.982
The black knight.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.526
That's aggressive.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.201
So, what's new?

27:01.536 --> 27:02.537
Is that a test?

27:03.496 --> 27:04.497
Is what a test?

27:07.042 --> 27:08.335
[Jack] Never mind.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.798
Oh, right. You think I'm in that...

27:14.549 --> 27:16.301
secret society of yours.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.386
I never said that.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.765
Well, if I was, which I'm not,

27:22.515 --> 27:26.144
I wouldn't tell you because I couldn't,
'cause you're not a member.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.772
But it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm not.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.194
[clunk]

27:36.655 --> 27:37.489
Checkmate.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.702
Yeah, sometimes the aggressive game
is the wrong tactic.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.414
-I'll just keep that in mind.
-Yeah. You do that.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.292
[male voice] Alyssa.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.795
-Hey.
-Hey, Kyle.

27:51.878 --> 27:52.962
Walk you to class?

27:54.047 --> 27:57.384
Sounds good. Hey, you said you were
looking for the English building, right?

27:57.926 --> 28:00.178
-Did I?
-You have a map.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.097
Use it.

28:04.057 --> 28:04.891
Okay.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.018
Come on, let's go.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.436
[clunk]

28:09.646 --> 28:10.480
Nice.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.489
English department, K-3.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.035
Knight five.

28:24.994 --> 28:25.995
K-5, no.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.373
Night five, N-5.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.919
I don't understand
what the Temple Magus sees in him.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.464
The same thing the Temple Magus
saw in us. Potential.

28:37.882 --> 28:41.010
Potential, my ass.
The English building's that way.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.659
N-5 should be...

29:08.663 --> 29:12.500
[sound of crows]

29:23.970 --> 29:24.804
[Jack] Todd!

29:26.139 --> 29:27.056
Are you okay?

29:27.932 --> 29:30.518
-I'm fine.
-Just trying to help.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.228
I don't want your help.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.522
I want that coin.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.445
Hang tight.

29:43.072 --> 29:43.907
It's in a box.

29:45.033 --> 29:45.950
By the door.

29:47.911 --> 29:48.995
I helped him!

29:49.078 --> 29:51.498
-He's disqualified!
-You're an ass hat.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.585
[groans]

30:23.571 --> 30:24.447
[lock rattles]

30:29.494 --> 30:31.204
[lock rattles]

30:38.336 --> 30:39.420
[crash]

30:39.504 --> 30:40.964
[snarls]

30:51.641 --> 30:52.809
Hello.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.102
[crash]

31:01.985 --> 31:02.861
[crash]

31:07.323 --> 31:08.867
-[crash]
-[snarls]

31:11.202 --> 31:12.787
[Todd, outside] I saw it first!

31:12.871 --> 31:13.997
[snarls]

31:16.332 --> 31:17.250
Silence.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.639
-[crash]
-[snarls]

31:31.723 --> 31:33.266
-[snarls]
-[rattles]

31:34.976 --> 31:36.978
[hurrying footsteps]

31:41.941 --> 31:43.026
Hand it over.

31:43.109 --> 31:45.028
[snarls]

31:45.945 --> 31:46.863
[snarls]

31:48.031 --> 31:49.741
-I found it first.
-[male voice] But...

31:50.700 --> 31:52.744
you couldn't claim it.

31:55.663 --> 31:56.623
[whoosh]

31:59.292 --> 32:02.045
-[Jack] What you gonna do with him?
-[male voice] With who?

32:16.643 --> 32:19.103
[Amir] I'm pumped that you got that coin
before Todd did.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.898
I mean, the last thing I want
is to be a secret society

32:22.106 --> 32:23.650
with just a bunch of assholes.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.444
A bunch of assholes.
I wonder if there's a name for that.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.404
-Like a murder of crows?
-Yeah.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.449
-A bleach of assholes, you know?
-[Jack laughs]

32:31.616 --> 32:34.535
-A Gregory of assholes.
-The assholios.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.453
[Jack laughs]

32:35.536 --> 32:36.788
A prolapse of assholes.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.875
What do you think was in that box?

32:42.293 --> 32:46.255
Man, I don't know, but whatever was,
it was mean and it was pissed off.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.341
[woman screaming]

32:48.424 --> 32:49.300
Come on!

32:58.518 --> 33:00.770
[Jack] Drea, hang on.
Amir, call an ambulance.

33:00.853 --> 33:01.813
[sound of a gun cocking]

33:01.896 --> 33:03.064
[Amir] Do you hear that?

33:03.856 --> 33:05.191
-Amir, be careful.
-Hey!

33:05.775 --> 33:06.985
-Hey!
-Shit.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.320
[Jack] Amir call 911 now!

33:09.404 --> 33:11.823
[Drea gasping]

33:11.906 --> 33:13.449
No, no. Stay with me.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.285
Hi, we need paramedics

33:16.369 --> 33:18.037
-to Belgrave University.
-No, no.

33:18.121 --> 33:21.082
-[Amir] A woman's been attacked.
-[Jack] Stay with me. Help! Help!

33:21.582 --> 33:22.500
Help!

33:22.583 --> 33:23.584
Shit!

33:29.632 --> 33:30.550
[Jack] Fuck.

33:35.805 --> 33:39.642
[male voice] So, you're walking home,
heard a scream, found her body.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.311
And that's it?

33:43.062 --> 33:43.938
That's it.

33:45.106 --> 33:45.940
You sure?

33:47.942 --> 33:48.776
Yeah.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.660
If you remember anything else.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.495
I already have one.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.122
Yeah.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.500
You're getting quite the collection.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.838
[Jack clears throat]

34:11.841 --> 34:14.552
NICE PEOPLE INSIDE. CERTAIN DEATH

34:20.641 --> 34:22.101
You requested a safe walk?

34:22.727 --> 34:24.687
Hey. What are...
[laughs]

34:25.480 --> 34:29.609
Oh, they must have double booked us.
Three thirty at the Delbrook Building?

34:30.026 --> 34:30.902
Yep.

34:32.028 --> 34:32.904
You take it.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.449
No, just... you can stick around,

34:36.532 --> 34:38.242
-if you want.
-Okay.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.204
[Jack] So.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.289
how you holding up?

34:44.874 --> 34:47.418
Me? I should be asking you that question.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.545
Me? I'm fine.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.632
You don't have to bottle up your feelings.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.383
You haven't met my grandfather.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.845
-"Suck it up, buttercup?"
-That is the Tao of Pete.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.265
Wow. You know, that sounds a lot
like the Gospel according to Babs.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.184
Stepmother.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.604
Hey.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.815
Thanks for the hint yesterday.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.235
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.694
You my safe-walk?

35:15.404 --> 35:17.323
-What happened to you?
-Bike accident.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.328
Yeah. Can we go?

35:23.329 --> 35:24.580
[Todd] Yeah, bikers.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.042
-What was in that powder?
-What powder?

35:28.376 --> 35:30.920
-That powder you just--
-I didn't do anything.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.422
And if somebody did do something
with some powder,

35:33.506 --> 35:35.341
do you think it's wise to talk to me
about it?

35:35.466 --> 35:37.510
Even though I don't know
what you're talking about?

35:37.593 --> 35:39.303
-Probably not.
-Definitely not.

35:40.096 --> 35:40.972
[Todd] Hello?

35:42.181 --> 35:44.225
I'm not feeling very safe.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.860
How do they do that?

35:59.699 --> 36:00.825
Professor Clarke?

36:01.576 --> 36:02.952
Please, John, call me Eric.

36:03.202 --> 36:04.036
My name's Jack.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.789
Oh, okay. Call me Brian.

36:06.873 --> 36:07.915
-Why Brian?
-Look,

36:07.999 --> 36:09.876
I won't remember your name,
it only seems fair.

36:09.959 --> 36:13.045
Oh. What if I told you
I had to do something wrong

36:13.129 --> 36:15.756
and I knew it was wrong,
but I also knew that if I did it,

36:15.840 --> 36:17.967
good would eventually come
from my actions?

36:18.050 --> 36:19.093
[Prof Clarke] Oh.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.888
You're already wondering
if you should kill the baby Hitler.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.306
-What?
-It's thought experiment.

36:23.389 --> 36:27.101
Sort of like the trolley question,
but with time travel. So, would you?

36:27.768 --> 36:30.188
Go back in time and kill Hitler?
Of course.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.440
You'd kill a baby? You monster!

36:32.523 --> 36:35.318
We don't know if he's born evil.
You're not even gonna try and save him?

36:35.401 --> 36:36.903
Okay, I won't.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.530
You won't? You won't kill Hitler?
He's fucking Hitler!

36:40.156 --> 36:41.449
Is this gonna be on the test?

36:41.532 --> 36:43.284
I don't know. But see, it...

36:43.576 --> 36:46.746
it illustrates that you can't use
a possibility to justify a certainty.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.250
Base your decision on the action itself.
Is it fundamentally good or bad?

36:51.334 --> 36:53.127
But I know good would come
from my actions.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.546
Okay, well, yeah.
Sounds like you've made up your mind.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.550
If you're looking for someone
to justify your decision for you,

37:00.051 --> 37:01.052
I'm not your man.

37:07.683 --> 37:08.684
I can do this.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.188
[Jack] Well, that was the scavenger hunt
from hell.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.443
[Amir] I can't believe they made you
get cocaine and a gun.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.737
They're not making it easy for you.

37:20.571 --> 37:21.530
How was your list?

37:22.281 --> 37:24.617
I couldn't tell if they were testing
my subservience

37:24.700 --> 37:26.327
or my religious convictions.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.664
Think how good it's gonna feel when they
initiate the both of us. 

37:29.747 --> 37:30.748
That's true.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.584
[chink]
[splash]

37:34.335 --> 37:36.879
Oh, shit, dude, I am so sorry.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.673
All over your good jeans, too.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.133
Those are your good jeans, right?

37:41.884 --> 37:43.219
Or are they your only jeans?

37:44.595 --> 37:46.681
[bartender] Here you go, two beers.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.432
Cheers, boys.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.476
[Jack clears throat]

37:54.105 --> 37:55.815
His voice sound familiar to you?

37:57.316 --> 37:58.484
Let's go, okay?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.570
Forget about them, okay?

38:08.327 --> 38:09.704
[Jack clears throat]

38:10.579 --> 38:12.415
[Jack] Better luck next time, dick face.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.085
See you around, Kyle.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.299
They cut me and kept that waste of skin?

38:21.507 --> 38:25.845
-It's such bullshit. I'm a fucking legacy!
-Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

38:27.263 --> 38:30.016
And don't worry about it, okay?
I'll take care of it.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.393
[cellphone rings]

38:37.565 --> 38:38.566
Duty calls.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.987
You're gonna get yourself
in trouble, Jack.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.618
[fencing rattles]

40:21.293 --> 40:22.128
knocks on wall]

40:24.046 --> 40:24.880
[knocks again]

40:27.967 --> 40:29.969
[door scratches on floor]

41:13.304 --> 41:14.889
[female voice] <i>Mala revelentur.</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:34.867
[Jack's voice]<i> Drea, hang on.</i>
<i>Amir, call an ambulance.</i>

41:36.619 --> 41:38.496
<i>-Did you hear that?</i>
<i>-Amir, be careful, eh?</i>

41:39.872 --> 41:40.706
[Jack's voice]<i> Hey!</i>

41:41.624 --> 41:43.459
<i>Amir, call 911 now!</i>

41:43.542 --> 41:46.170
<i>No, no. Stay with me.</i>
<i>Stay with me. Help!</i>

41:47.129 --> 41:48.005
<i>Help!</i>

41:50.591 --> 41:51.425
Necromancy.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.512
[faint hissing]

41:54.970 --> 41:55.804
[click]

41:56.096 --> 41:57.556
It's so disgusting.

41:58.474 --> 42:00.726
[sound of flames]

42:04.480 --> 42:05.898
[Jack] You're not surprised?

42:06.065 --> 42:07.483
Why aren't you surprised?

42:09.276 --> 42:11.070
Because it makes a lot of sense.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.988
Magic? It makes sense to you?

42:14.114 --> 42:16.659
There's always been rumors
about strange rituals.

42:16.825 --> 42:18.118
Human sacrifices.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.080
This explains so much.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.084
-It's fantastic.
-No!

42:25.167 --> 42:28.671
It is insane.
I did not sign up for this, okay?

42:28.754 --> 42:30.881
Something in the forest
is killing Neophytes.

42:30.965 --> 42:34.134
-And two students are already dead.
-Wait, wait. Back that up.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.137
-What's a Neophyte?
-It's what they call the pledges.

42:41.141 --> 42:43.936
You heard me when I said
something is killing us, right?

42:44.436 --> 42:46.772
[Pops]
Have a little faith in yourself, sport.

42:46.855 --> 42:49.108
Hell, if anything...

42:51.026 --> 42:52.653
this will make your life easier.

42:53.153 --> 42:56.657
[Jack] Er, no. Look, look, Pops,
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.328
We've always wanted to ruin his life.

43:02.454 --> 43:05.791
Imagine what we can do to this bastard
with magic in our arsenal.

43:05.874 --> 43:06.709
Pete.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.335
I don't wanna die.

43:08.669 --> 43:09.712
-Fine.
-Okay.

43:09.878 --> 43:11.839
And we don't want anyone else to die,
either.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.507
Nobody's gonna die.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.176
Well, except for the...

43:17.386 --> 43:19.471
two who already did. I can see that.

43:19.555 --> 43:20.514
Erm...

43:21.181 --> 43:22.099
Come on.

43:22.683 --> 43:23.809
I'll buy you a beer.

43:27.021 --> 43:28.522
What the...? Hey.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.783
I think they just magicked this
into my pocket.

43:40.743 --> 43:41.577
Really?

43:42.328 --> 43:43.412
The way you described it,

43:43.495 --> 43:46.457
I was expecting something
a little more Siegfried and Roy.

43:54.548 --> 43:56.634
"Wear for your protection."

44:00.971 --> 44:02.056
"Observance."

44:16.028 --> 44:18.781
You can stare at the board all you want,
you still lost.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.829
[Jack] I know I'm not supposed to know
you're a member,

44:26.455 --> 44:27.998
and I know you won't answer, but...

44:28.832 --> 44:29.958
I gotta ask.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.920
This final test, is it worth it?

44:37.383 --> 44:38.509
At first, no.

44:39.593 --> 44:43.472
It's demanding and time consuming
and a lot of sacrifice.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.893
But eventually, yes.

44:48.602 --> 44:49.687
It'll be worth it.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.230
Why?

44:51.772 --> 44:53.232
Because of the potential.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.360
Because of what you're gonna
be able to do.

44:59.822 --> 45:00.656
Thank you.

45:13.085 --> 45:15.671
[Jack] Oh,
this is not how I wanna spend my night.

45:16.922 --> 45:19.633
[shovel clinks on ground]

45:19.717 --> 45:21.385
But I guess it's the price of admission.

45:25.556 --> 45:26.390
[sighs]

45:27.599 --> 45:28.642
I'm sorry, Mom.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.272
[shutter sound]

45:35.607 --> 45:38.694
[man laughing]

45:39.570 --> 45:40.904
[Kyle] Oh, man!

45:41.655 --> 45:44.158
I just don't get the aversion
to black and white, you know?

45:44.241 --> 45:47.745
There's just something about it.
It's so... real.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.872
You set me up.

45:50.539 --> 45:52.249
Mom's grave. Nice touch.

45:52.332 --> 45:54.835
Mm. I do have a flare
for the dramatic, don't I?

45:55.294 --> 45:57.838
Okay, so this is how this is gonna go.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.507
You're going to drop out, voluntarily,

46:01.008 --> 46:02.634
and I'll let you keep your scholarship.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.303
That's so big of you, Kyle.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.890
Or you can keep being
a belligerent little shit,

46:08.348 --> 46:10.768
and I take this to the chancellor,
the police.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.603
Hell, see how many hits
I get on the Internet.

46:12.686 --> 46:14.605
Blackmail? Oh, man.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.982
What a relief.
I thought you were the killer.

46:17.065 --> 46:18.358
Oh, no, no.

46:18.442 --> 46:21.278
If I was the killer,
you'd already be dead.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.867
Let's test that theory.

46:30.621 --> 46:31.872
[chink of metal]

46:37.669 --> 46:38.962
[seething sound]

46:39.046 --> 46:41.173
Er,
do you know how a fight actually works?

46:43.759 --> 46:44.885
<i>Deleatur!</i>

46:44.968 --> 46:47.513
[crash]
[falling of rubble]

46:53.268 --> 46:54.520
Holy shit!

46:54.645 --> 46:56.855
[Kyle chuckles]
Oh, that's right.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.315
[snarling]

46:58.398 --> 47:00.317
You should be very afraid of me.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.611
Kyle, behind you.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.488
Do you honestly think
I'm gonna fall for that?

47:04.571 --> 47:07.199
[snarling]

47:13.288 --> 47:14.373
[snarls]

47:14.456 --> 47:16.708
-Oh, shit, man!
-[shovel clangs]

47:16.792 --> 47:18.210
[Jack] Oh, shit! Sorry.

47:18.293 --> 47:19.294
[wolf snarls]

47:19.378 --> 47:21.588
No, wait! Fuck you, Kyle!
Fuck you for bringing me here.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.756
[wolf snarls]

47:23.215 --> 47:24.424
Okay, boy, take it easy.

47:24.675 --> 47:25.717
I'm just a pledge.
