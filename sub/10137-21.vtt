WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.754
Go ahead, boys,

00:02.294 --> 00:03.754
eat your breakfast.

00:03.796 --> 00:06.131
It's just how you like it,

00:03.796 --> 00:06.131
within reach.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.802
My bread is broken.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.556
No, Nicky, it's not broken.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.556
It's a bagel.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.725
If it didn't have a hole,

00:14.598 --> 00:16.725
it'd be a hokey puck.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.770
It's broken, look.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.986
Aunt Becky, we've got

00:24.692 --> 00:26.986
a bagel situation here.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.904
I know how to handle this.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.072
Boys, let mama see those bagels.

00:31.114 --> 00:34.869
Thank you. Thank you. Alright.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.287
'One for you..'

00:37.329 --> 00:39.665
'...and one for you.'

00:40.624 --> 00:42.376
There you go.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.419
All fixed. What do you think?

00:44.461 --> 00:46.714
Okey-dokey.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.674
Okey-dokey-dokey.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.968
There you go. There you go.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.260
Very creative.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.680
Oh, bagels are easy.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.849
Cheerios are hard.

all I'm asking is for you

02:19.098 --> 02:21.182
to extend my curfew

02:19.098 --> 02:21.182
by half an hour.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.060
A measly 30 minutes.

02:23.102 --> 02:26.271
One "Mama's Family" rerun.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.316
Steph, last month I extended

02:26.313 --> 02:29.316
your curfew by "Baywatch."

02:30.400 --> 02:32.193
What's next, "Lonesome Dove?"

02:33.612 --> 02:35.614
Steph, give it up. Dad's a rock.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.617
Okay, you win for now.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.954
But don't forget,

02:38.659 --> 02:41.954
I'm younger, I'm stronger

02:41.996 --> 02:44.331
and I know where you live.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.707
- See you later.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.707
- Bye, Dad.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.417
- Bye.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.417
- Hi, Stephanie.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.252
- Hi, Mr. Tanner.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.252
- Hey, Denise.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.713
Michelle, Denise is here.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.966
I know, I saw her coming.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.095
Here's your lunch, Michelle.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.095
All your favorites, okay?

02:58.137 --> 02:59.387
Tuna on date-nut bread

02:59.429 --> 03:01.389
a crisp red apple,

02:59.429 --> 03:01.389
and a homemade cupcake.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.182
- There you go.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.182
- Thanks.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.560
- What you got?

03:03.224 --> 03:05.560
- I haven't looked yet.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.562
But the smell's oniony.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.109
Trade you.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.319
Okay.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.570
Denise, I, uh, hope you enjoy

03:15.612 --> 03:17.948
the "Love, dad" icing

03:15.612 --> 03:17.948
on the cupcake.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.658
[chuckles]

03:17.990 --> 03:19.658
I always do.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.704
Girls, remember, by the way..

03:23.745 --> 03:25.330
...today is

03:23.745 --> 03:25.330
parent volunteer day.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.915
So I'll see you guys

03:25.372 --> 03:26.915
in just a little bit, okay?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.167
- Okay, bye, Mr. Tanner.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.167
- Bye.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.835
Bye-bye.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.712
Parent volunteer, huh?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.047
I hope

03:31.753 --> 03:33.047
you're not gonna teach them

03:33.088 --> 03:34.840
what you taught us

03:33.088 --> 03:34.840
in the fifth grade

03:34.882 --> 03:38.010
"Mildew is a big 'mil-don't."

03:38.052 --> 03:40.595
I thought I taught you guys

03:38.052 --> 03:40.595
a very valuable lesson.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.557
Yeah, to stay home

03:40.637 --> 03:43.557
on parent volunteer day.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.358
Alright, class, let's say hello

03:50.564 --> 03:53.358
to our parent volunteer

03:53.400 --> 03:55.402
Mr. Tanner, Michelle's dad.

03:55.443 --> 03:59.198
(in unison)

03:55.443 --> 03:59.198
Hi, Michelle's dad.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.366
Hi, Michelle's class.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.329
Excuse me,

04:02.868 --> 04:06.329
is this Miss Barnes' class?

04:06.371 --> 04:08.707
Teddy. Teddy's here.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.752
You came to the right place,

04:08.749 --> 04:11.752
come on in.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.672
I see some of you

04:13.128 --> 04:15.672
remember Teddy?

04:15.714 --> 04:20.010
I do. He used to live here

04:15.714 --> 04:20.010
but then he moved to Texas.

04:20.052 --> 04:23.555
Howdy. That's how

04:20.052 --> 04:23.555
they say "hi" in Texas.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.851
Ooh, ooh. Miss Barnes,

04:25.015 --> 04:27.851
could Teddy sit here?

04:27.893 --> 04:30.395
Well, if that's okay

04:27.893 --> 04:30.395
with Teddy.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.397
You bet, partner.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.028
I've got to stop talking Texas.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.362
Okay, let's settle down now

04:39.404 --> 04:40.948
and pay attention to Mr. Tanner.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.323
Thank you, Miss Barnes.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.243
Okay this a little project

04:42.365 --> 04:44.243
that I thought of

04:44.284 --> 04:46.536
that I know you guys

04:44.284 --> 04:46.536
are all gonna love.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.038
A-and I don't mean recess.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.166
[laughing]

04:51.208 --> 04:53.210
Okay, tough classroom.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.130
Alright, what I want

04:53.252 --> 04:56.130
you guys to do is

04:56.171 --> 04:59.174
trace a life-size drawing

04:56.171 --> 04:59.174
of your best friend.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.261
Just like I did.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.261
This is my best friend, Joey.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.765
That's how he looks

05:05.222 --> 05:06.765
before breakfast.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.477
He's not a morning person.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.853
No, that-that's true.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.354
What I want you guys to do

05:11.895 --> 05:13.354
is I want you to

05:13.396 --> 05:14.648
trace your best friend, okay?

05:14.689 --> 05:16.733
Color it in and then

05:14.689 --> 05:16.733
tell us all a story

05:16.775 --> 05:19.153
about why that person

05:16.775 --> 05:19.153
is your best friend.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.863
Okay, we've got paper

05:19.194 --> 05:21.863
and supplies for all of you.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.366
I got back just in time,

05:21.905 --> 05:25.366
you could trace me.

05:25.408 --> 05:29.121
Hey, I'm her best friend,

05:25.408 --> 05:29.121
she's tracin' me.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.832
Michelle, you've gotta pick

05:29.163 --> 05:31.832
one of us.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.760
That's not a pelican,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.760
he just has a big mouth.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.053
[laughing]

05:45.095 --> 05:46.263
Uh, Jess, I'm sorry we're late.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.473
I had to pick up

05:46.305 --> 05:48.473
Roxy at the airport.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.475
Oh, airport pick up.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.393
This relationship's getting

05:50.517 --> 05:52.393
serious, huh?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.812
Oh, we'd have been here sooner

05:53.854 --> 05:56.690
but I couldn't get Joey

05:53.854 --> 05:56.690
off the moving sidewalk.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.692
Hey, it's fun going

05:56.731 --> 05:58.692
the wrong way.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.110
[laughing]

06:00.152 --> 06:01.360
So, Roxy, I was reading

06:00.152 --> 06:01.360
that you, uh

06:01.402 --> 06:02.529
you have a gig

06:01.402 --> 06:02.529
in town this weekend.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.864
Yeah.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.032
Why don't you come on the show

06:03.905 --> 06:05.032
and plug it.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.365
Hey, that's great

06:06.407 --> 06:07.701
as long as you guys don't mind.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.204
Oh, it's fine with us,

06:07.742 --> 06:10.204
but, uh..

06:10.245 --> 06:13.040
Roxy, let me give you

06:10.245 --> 06:13.040
a little word of warning.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.582
Better, uh,

06:13.081 --> 06:14.582
fasten your seatbelt

06:14.624 --> 06:16.626
because when Joey

06:14.624 --> 06:16.626
and I get going..

06:16.668 --> 06:18.461
...things get moving

06:16.668 --> 06:18.461
pretty fast around here.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.921
You know. huh, Joe, huh?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.007
Yeah, don't worry,

06:19.963 --> 06:22.007
once the zingers start flying

06:22.049 --> 06:23.925
I'll shield you

06:22.049 --> 06:23.925
with my body, huh?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.219
- Huh? Huh?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.219
- Yeah?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.720
- Huh?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.720
- Yeah.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.138
- You see how we..

06:26.761 --> 06:28.138
- Right off to top of our--

06:28.180 --> 06:29.639
It's, uh, it's dangerous.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.058
Alright, um.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.351
Sit down here.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.351
Give her a seat.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.768
Here you go.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.521
Okay, Roxy...now brace yourself

06:36.563 --> 06:40.775
...because we're on

06:36.563 --> 06:40.775
in three, two, one.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.320
(Man on speaker)

06:40.817 --> 06:43.320
'Rush-Hour Renegades.'

06:43.362 --> 06:45.655
'Coming at you.'

06:45.697 --> 06:48.242
Alright, San Francisco,

06:45.697 --> 06:48.242
we're the Rush-Hour Renegades.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.910
Jesse and Joey,

06:48.283 --> 06:49.910
comin' at you live.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.703
We are the double R

06:49.951 --> 06:51.703
with H in the middle.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.955
and the big hand is on the four

06:51.745 --> 06:53.955
little hand's on my thigh.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.583
- Joey, what are you doing?

06:53.997 --> 06:56.583
- Whoa, sorry, Jess.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.252
We're a little cramped in here

06:56.624 --> 06:58.252
today because we have

06:58.293 --> 07:00.795
a very special guest,

06:58.293 --> 07:00.795
Roxy Martin.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.798
She's a stand-up comic,

07:00.837 --> 07:03.798
she's cute, she's funny

07:03.840 --> 07:06.425
and she just happens

07:03.840 --> 07:06.425
to be my girlfriend.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.930
Well, two out

07:07.761 --> 07:09.930
of three ain't bad.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.932
Hi, San Francisco,

07:09.971 --> 07:11.932
hope you'll come

07:11.973 --> 07:14.142
and see me at the Giggle Garage

07:11.973 --> 07:14.142
this weekend.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.727
I'll be there

07:14.184 --> 07:15.727
giggling every night

07:15.769 --> 07:17.979
except Friday,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.979
that's my hockey night.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.856
Oh, Roxy, you like hockey,

07:18.021 --> 07:19.856
don't you?

07:19.898 --> 07:22.276
Well, I do prefer something

07:19.898 --> 07:22.276
a little less bloody.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.527
Like open heart surgery.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.071
That's true,

07:24.569 --> 07:26.071
and I knew this doctor--

07:26.113 --> 07:28.240
(Joey)

07:26.113 --> 07:28.240
'I know exactly

07:26.113 --> 07:28.240
what you're saying.'

07:28.282 --> 07:30.784
I had a game last week,

07:28.282 --> 07:30.784
I lost four teeth.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.327
And that was during

07:30.825 --> 07:32.327
the national anthem.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.828
[laughing]

07:33.870 --> 07:35.914
Speaking of the national anthem,

07:33.870 --> 07:35.914
Roseanne Barr sang--

07:35.956 --> 07:38.666
(Roxy)

07:35.956 --> 07:38.666
'Oh man. It's really amazing,

07:35.956 --> 07:38.666
you know.'

07:38.708 --> 07:41.502
What other profession

07:38.708 --> 07:41.502
lets you fight on the job?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.255
Oh, I know exactly

07:41.544 --> 07:43.255
what you are saying.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.340
When was the last time you saw

07:43.297 --> 07:45.340
two accountants dooking it out

07:45.382 --> 07:48.676
because someone

07:45.382 --> 07:48.676
forgot to carry the four?

07:48.718 --> 07:51.054
You know, th-there's fighting

07:48.718 --> 07:51.054
in other sports too.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.931
Hey, guys-guys, there's fighting

07:51.096 --> 07:52.931
in other sports too, you know

07:52.973 --> 07:54.766
like, um..

07:54.808 --> 07:55.934
...uh..

07:57.936 --> 07:59.313
...boxing.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.819
Oh, my dad was a boxer,

08:02.399 --> 08:05.819
but, well, he wasn't very good.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.070
You know, he fought

08:05.860 --> 08:07.070
under the name

08:07.112 --> 08:08.488
"Kid Hit Me And I'll Fall."

08:08.529 --> 08:10.198
[laughing]

08:10.240 --> 08:11.658
Yeah, I think I read about him.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.951
Never made it to the ring.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.661
Got punched out

08:12.993 --> 08:14.661
by the peanut vendor.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.079
[laughing]

08:19.791 --> 08:21.668
Oh, boy, and on that note

08:21.709 --> 08:25.088
it's time to check in

08:21.709 --> 08:25.088
with Jesse in traffic, Jess?

08:27.424 --> 08:30.010
It's rush hour, you're stuck.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.146
Come on, Michelle,

08:37.976 --> 08:41.146
we gotta do the project.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.190
(Denise)

08:41.188 --> 08:43.190
'Who you gonna trace?'

08:43.231 --> 08:45.650
Okay, okay. Let's see.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.320
Teddy was my old best friend.

08:48.362 --> 08:52.532
That's right. Trace away.

08:52.573 --> 08:56.286
But Denise is my

08:52.573 --> 08:56.286
new best friend.

08:56.328 --> 09:01.166
And "new" means "now"

08:56.328 --> 09:01.166
so move it, Tex.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.003
No, uh, old means first

09:05.045 --> 09:06.713
new means second.

09:06.754 --> 09:10.550
I'm in, you're out. Excuse me.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.177
(Michelle)

09:10.591 --> 09:12.177
'Guys, guys.'

09:12.219 --> 09:13.636
I like you both.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.180
How do I decide?

09:16.556 --> 09:20.310
I'll give you my bolo tie

09:16.556 --> 09:20.310
that I got in Texas.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.354
This is neat.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.190
Well, uh. you could

09:22.396 --> 09:25.190
have my scrunchie.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.984
- Cool.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.984
- Oh, yeah?

09:28.026 --> 09:30.445
I got Snickles.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.613
I like Snickles.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.116
There's only one left.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.451
Green?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.078
I don't know.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.746
Red's my favorite.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.709
Denise, do you have

09:42.582 --> 09:44.709
anything better?

09:44.751 --> 09:48.213
All I have is my

09:44.751 --> 09:48.213
Princess Jasmine pencil case.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.050
That will go great

09:49.423 --> 09:52.050
with my Abu eraser.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.512
Who said you could have this?

09:56.804 --> 09:59.391
Well, don't you wanna

09:56.804 --> 09:59.391
be my best friend?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.935
Not if you take all my stuff.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.812
If Teddy wants

10:01.976 --> 10:04.812
to give you all his stuff..

10:04.854 --> 10:06.523
...good for him.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.693
I don't want to.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.693
I love that tie.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.863
And it looks really good

10:10.735 --> 10:13.863
on you too.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.823
You think so?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.742
Give me back my tie.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.165
And I want my scrunchie back.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.334
Snickle.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.963
Wait a minute, now who's

10:26.376 --> 10:29.963
gonna be my best friend?

10:30.004 --> 10:32.215
- Not me.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.261
You know,<i> I</i> like green Snickles.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.762
I'm your man.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.183
How did that happen?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.395
[Comet whines]

10:56.490 --> 10:58.783
Which bring us

10:56.490 --> 10:58.783
to point number 57--

10:58.825 --> 11:01.119
Steph, exactly

10:58.825 --> 11:01.119
how many points are there?

11:01.161 --> 11:04.539
As many as it takes

11:01.161 --> 11:04.539
to get you to extend my curfew.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.542
Now, the maturity factor.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.003
I have here a signed affidavit

11:10.044 --> 11:11.796
from a cashier at Sizzler

11:11.838 --> 11:13.131
who called me "ma'am."

11:15.049 --> 11:17.051
- Dad?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.051
- Not now, Michelle.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.553
He's starting to weaken.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.221
I'm sorry, Steph, no sale

11:20.263 --> 11:21.848
your curfew remains the same.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.642
Ugh, thanks a lot, Michelle.

11:23.682 --> 11:24.725
It's not her fault.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.102
I know, but if I get mad at you

11:26.144 --> 11:27.854
my curfew will be before hers.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.858
Hey, honey, what's up?

11:33.318 --> 11:35.862
I can't do

11:33.318 --> 11:35.862
my best friend project.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.030
Why not?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.573
Because I don't have

11:37.071 --> 11:38.573
a best friend.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.536
That was a key element.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.536
What happened?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.703
Well, everything

11:42.577 --> 11:44.703
would have been fine

11:44.745 --> 11:46.331
if Teddy had red Snickles.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.917
Well, what do red Snickles

11:47.790 --> 11:49.917
have to do with it?

11:49.959 --> 11:52.086
More importantly,

11:49.959 --> 11:52.086
what-what exactly is a Snickle?

11:52.128 --> 11:53.547
I tried to be fair to pick

11:53.588 --> 11:55.590
the best friend

11:53.588 --> 11:55.590
with the best stuff.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.966
Teddy gave me his tie

11:57.008 --> 11:59.010
and Denise gave me

11:57.008 --> 11:59.010
her scrunchie.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
Is-is a scrunchie

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
like a Snickle?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.890
Dad, stay with me.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.725
I'm trying to, Michelle.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.269
I'm trying to get

12:06.767 --> 12:08.269
a handle on this.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.146
But it-it sounds to me

12:08.311 --> 12:10.146
like you were making

12:10.188 --> 12:12.607
people give you

12:10.188 --> 12:12.607
weird sounding stuff

12:12.649 --> 12:14.359
to try to get them

12:12.649 --> 12:14.359
to be your best friend.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.111
I didn't make them.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.111
They wanted to.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.573
Then they got mad at me.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.782
Well, maybe you should apologize

12:19.614 --> 12:21.782
to Teddy and Denise.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.160
I can't believe

12:21.824 --> 12:24.160
you are on their side.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.662
It's not that

12:24.202 --> 12:25.662
I'm not on their side, honey.

12:25.704 --> 12:26.996
It's-it sounds to me

12:25.704 --> 12:26.996
like you are trying

12:27.038 --> 12:28.956
to take advantage

12:27.038 --> 12:28.956
of the situation.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.084
And I think maybe

12:28.998 --> 12:31.084
you should say you're sorry.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.044
Do I have to?

12:33.086 --> 12:36.673
No. I'm not gonna

12:33.086 --> 12:36.673
force you apologize.

12:36.715 --> 12:40.009
I think you're old enough

12:36.715 --> 12:40.009
to decide for yourself.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.220
Good, I decide not to.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.516
Should have seen that coming.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.479
...says "That's not a hat,

12:47.892 --> 12:51.479
it's a bad haircut."

12:51.521 --> 12:53.356
- Hi, Steph.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.356
- Hey, Joey.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.109
Roxy, you and Joey were

12:53.398 --> 12:56.109
hysterical on the radio today.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.277
(Roxy)

12:56.150 --> 12:57.277
'Thanks.'

12:57.318 --> 12:58.361
You know, Uncle Jesse

12:58.403 --> 12:59.529
you should have been there.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.075
I was there.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.702
Don't you listen

13:04.117 --> 13:05.702
to the traffic reports?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.121
I'm sorry, Jesse.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.998
I guess we did monopolize

13:08.162 --> 13:10.998
time today.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.752
Yeah, once we got rolling,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.752
we kind of got carried away.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.169
Hope you didn't mind.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.504
Oh, come on, me mind?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.047
Please, guys,

13:16.546 --> 13:18.047
you think I'm so insecure

13:18.089 --> 13:19.633
that I'd be sitting

13:18.089 --> 13:19.633
there looking at my watch

13:19.674 --> 13:21.384
while you guys talk

13:19.674 --> 13:21.384
for an hour and 48 minutes?

13:22.677 --> 13:25.597
Look, bottom line

13:22.677 --> 13:25.597
is...it was good radio.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.600
Well, that's great,

13:26.723 --> 13:28.600
because, you know

13:28.642 --> 13:30.226
with so many phone calls

13:28.642 --> 13:30.226
that we got

13:30.268 --> 13:31.770
people loving it so much

13:31.810 --> 13:34.272
I was thinking maybe Roxy could

13:31.810 --> 13:34.272
join us again tomorrow.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.023
If that's okay with you?

13:36.065 --> 13:37.651
Yeah, fine.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.651
Oh, sure it's okay.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.277
You know, in fact, you know,

13:37.692 --> 13:39.277
it's better thank okay

13:39.319 --> 13:41.112
it's-it's A-Okay.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.198
Okay, A.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.533
[laughing]

13:45.575 --> 13:46.909
Let's go write some bits

13:45.575 --> 13:46.909
for tomorrow.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.454
'Oh, yeah, okay.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.454
You, kids, have fun, now.'

13:49.496 --> 13:51.289
Don't bother to include me.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.378
Oh, hey, shorty.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.464
- How you feeling?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.464
- I've been better.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.633
Yeah, I know the feeling.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.633
Have a berry.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.512
What do you do when

14:03.259 --> 14:05.512
your friends leave you out?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.473
Traffic reports.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.850
- Huh?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.850
- Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.394
Listen, if you're friends

14:11.892 --> 14:13.394
are leaving you out

14:13.436 --> 14:15.229
and they're not treating you

14:13.436 --> 14:15.229
right, I say, uh

14:15.271 --> 14:17.398
you know, make new friends.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.775
Hi, honey. Hi, Michelle.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.401
- Hi, hon.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.401
- Hi.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.487
Where do you get a best friend?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.656
Well, I married mine.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.824
[chuckles]

14:27.033 --> 14:29.703
Great, I'm not even dating yet.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.164
Hey, hey, the berries, the be--

14:35.208 --> 14:37.251
- Great show today, honey.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.251
- Eh.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.838
Joey and Roxy were hilarious.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.633
Well, they weren't hila..

14:39.879 --> 14:43.633
like "hi-larious" hilarious.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.385
Beck, you know what?

14:43.675 --> 14:45.385
I just got a great idea.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.136
Why don't you come

14:45.426 --> 14:47.136
on the show tomorrow?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.304
- Why?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.304
- It'll be fun.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.430
We'll have a few laughs,

14:48.346 --> 14:49.430
you'll plug

14:49.472 --> 14:50.724
"Wake Up, San Francisco."

14:50.765 --> 14:54.310
Bottom line is,

14:50.765 --> 14:54.310
it'll be good radio.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.687
Well, is it okay with Joey?

14:55.729 --> 14:58.398
Yeah, yeah, it's more than okay,

14:55.729 --> 14:58.398
it's A-Okay.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.276
Alright, now, I've got

14:59.816 --> 15:02.276
all my stuff back from you

15:02.318 --> 15:04.028
and you got your stuff back

15:02.318 --> 15:04.028
from me.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.448
We just have one more piece

15:04.070 --> 15:07.448
of unfinished business.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.951
Now, you promised

15:07.490 --> 15:10.951
to watch "Fists of Fury."

15:10.993 --> 15:13.496
I don't have to watch it now.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.496
We broke up.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.081
We made this deal

15:13.538 --> 15:15.081
when we were going together.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.666
[chuckles]

15:15.122 --> 15:16.666
Oh, great.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.668
So I watched "Steel Magnolias"

15:16.708 --> 15:18.668
for nothing, huh?

15:21.045 --> 15:24.382
D.J., can I trace you

15:21.045 --> 15:24.382
for my school project?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.551
I thought you're supposed

15:24.424 --> 15:26.551
to trace your best friend.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.095
Well, I called

15:26.593 --> 15:29.095
everybody in my class

15:29.136 --> 15:31.013
but all the best friends

15:29.136 --> 15:31.013
were taken.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.350
So I decided

15:31.055 --> 15:34.350
to ask my best sister.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.896
Well, that's sweet.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.773
And when Stephanie said no..

15:41.232 --> 15:43.401
...I decided that

15:41.232 --> 15:43.401
you were my last chance.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.530
So I'm your second best sister?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.782
No.

15:48.823 --> 15:53.327
But I saw

15:48.823 --> 15:53.327
Stephanie first and I-I..

15:53.369 --> 15:54.621
...blew it, didn't I?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.624
Hey, squirt, I'll help you out.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.459
- You will?

15:57.665 --> 15:59.459
- Sure.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.378
Here's the door.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.015
(man on radio)

16:12.430 --> 16:15.015
'Rush-Hour Renegades.'

16:15.057 --> 16:16.225
'Coming at you.'

16:17.602 --> 16:18.728
Alright. Hello, San Francisco.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.062
- I'm Jesse.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.062
- I'm Joey.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.731
And we are the Rush-Hour

16:20.104 --> 16:21.731
Renegades.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.483
Now, if you're stuck in traffic,

16:21.773 --> 16:23.483
you set that cruise control

16:23.524 --> 16:26.193
to five miles an hour, put your

16:23.524 --> 16:26.193
feet up on the dashboard and..

16:26.235 --> 16:27.779
[sqweaking]

16:26.235 --> 16:27.779
...enjoy.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.363
I'd just like to say

16:27.821 --> 16:29.363
that we have

16:29.405 --> 16:31.282
a special guest

16:29.405 --> 16:31.282
joining us once again today

16:31.324 --> 16:33.451
for the drive home, Roxy Martin.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.538
Hi, everybody.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.707
Yeah, well-well let's not forget

16:37.580 --> 16:39.707
our extra special guest

16:39.749 --> 16:42.084
my lovely and talented wife,

16:39.749 --> 16:42.084
Rebecca Donaldson

16:42.126 --> 16:44.128
of

16:42.126 --> 16:44.128
"Wake Up, San Francisco"<i> </i> fame.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.049
- Nice to be here.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.049
- Good, honey. Good.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.718
[giggles]

16:49.091 --> 16:50.718
It's nice to have you both here.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.680
Now, did I mention that Roxy

16:50.760 --> 16:53.680
will be doing two shows..

16:53.721 --> 16:56.683
...Friday and Saturday night

16:53.721 --> 16:56.683
at the Giggle Garage?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.855
And-and-and did I mention that,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.855
uh, Becky's doing

17:01.896 --> 17:03.648
one show on channel 6

17:01.896 --> 17:03.648
on Monday, Tuesday

17:03.690 --> 17:05.692
Wednesday, Thursday

17:03.690 --> 17:05.692
and Friday mornings?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.279
Uh, speaking of mornings..

17:10.321 --> 17:12.365
...Roxy, you should see me by

17:10.321 --> 17:12.365
dawn's early light.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.368
It's pretty scary. For my own

17:12.406 --> 17:15.368
protection, I shave in the dark.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.911
[laughing]

17:16.953 --> 17:18.705
That's why your

17:16.953 --> 17:18.705
cheek's in a tourniquet.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.709
Yeah, right, hey,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.709
still speaking of morning..

17:22.750 --> 17:24.836
...Beck, what was that funny

17:22.750 --> 17:24.836
thing our kids did

17:24.878 --> 17:26.671
yesterday, huh, tell 'em.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.882
What funny thing?

17:28.923 --> 17:30.424
Ah, the-the funny thing

17:30.466 --> 17:31.968
the-the milk was coming out

17:30.466 --> 17:31.968
of their nose.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.469
The milk escapade.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.469
T-talk about that.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.388
Oh, no, no, no,

17:33.511 --> 17:35.388
that-that wasn't yesterday

17:35.429 --> 17:36.806
that was two weeks ago.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.016
Who cares what day it is, honey

17:38.057 --> 17:39.726
it was still funny, wasn't it?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.769
Actually, it was disgusting.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.479
And actually, it was Joey.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.856
[laughing]

17:44.898 --> 17:46.566
Good thing

17:44.898 --> 17:46.566
I wasn't wearing a shirt.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.108
[laughing]

17:49.193 --> 17:50.444
Uh, speaking of shirts..

17:50.486 --> 17:52.196
..how about those guys

17:50.486 --> 17:52.196
who tuck their shirts

17:52.238 --> 17:53.280
in their underwear?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.699
Do they think

17:53.322 --> 17:54.699
that's a good look?

17:54.741 --> 17:55.783
[laughing]

17:55.825 --> 17:57.035
Yeah, why not go all the way

17:57.076 --> 17:58.452
and stick their pants

17:57.076 --> 17:58.452
in their socks?

17:58.494 --> 17:59.704
[laughing]

18:01.664 --> 18:03.165
Back to us, back to us.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.210
Um, Beck, uh, let's talk more

18:03.207 --> 18:06.210
about our kids, huh?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.712
Who's speaking about our kids?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.047
We were, we were talking

18:07.754 --> 18:09.047
about our kids.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.464
and all the-all the funny things

18:09.088 --> 18:10.464
they do

18:10.506 --> 18:11.841
They say the darnedest things,

18:10.506 --> 18:11.841
don't they?

18:11.883 --> 18:13.342
Well, they do say

18:11.883 --> 18:13.342
the darndest things

18:13.384 --> 18:15.011
but I thought

18:13.384 --> 18:15.011
we were talking about tucking.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.220
They were talking about tucking

18:16.262 --> 18:18.097
we were-we were talking

18:16.262 --> 18:18.097
about our kids..

18:18.138 --> 18:21.100
...and all the funny,

18:18.138 --> 18:21.100
uh, junk they do.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.520
I thought we were all

18:22.351 --> 18:24.520
on the same show.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.480
You know, it's so hard

18:24.562 --> 18:26.480
to tell sometimes.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.528
Uh, we'll be right back

18:29.191 --> 18:32.528
after this brief message

18:32.570 --> 18:35.155
from the Troll King Smorgasbord.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.034
Located at under

18:35.197 --> 18:38.034
a bridge near you.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.535
[drum music]

18:41.120 --> 18:42.914
Jess, I don't work

18:41.120 --> 18:42.914
for the Psychic Network

18:42.956 --> 18:45.207
but I'm sensing a little

18:42.956 --> 18:45.207
competition going on here.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.126
There's no competition

18:45.249 --> 18:47.126
going, I'd-I'd just, you know

18:47.167 --> 18:49.336
would like to be included

18:47.167 --> 18:49.336
in my own show, that's all.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.173
Well, I asked you before

18:50.838 --> 18:53.173
if you're feeling left out.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.801
Well, I'm not feeling left out.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.845
- Well, what are you feeling?

18:54.842 --> 18:57.845
- I'm feeling not in.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.475
It's my fault. It's your show

18:59.346 --> 19:02.475
and I'm just intruding.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.268
No, Roxy, it's-it's my fault.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.437
I should have been

19:04.310 --> 19:06.437
more sensitive to my partner.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.939
No, actually, it's his fault.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.899
Yeah, actually it's..

19:07.981 --> 19:09.899
My fault? Why?

19:09.941 --> 19:13.193
Yes. Well, Joey asked you

19:09.941 --> 19:13.193
if there was anything wrong

19:13.235 --> 19:14.946
why weren't you honest

19:13.235 --> 19:14.946
about your feelings?

19:14.988 --> 19:17.573
Because I'm not a cry-baby,

19:14.988 --> 19:17.573
you know, I'm not gonna go

19:17.615 --> 19:21.577
"Oh, I'm so sorry,

19:17.615 --> 19:21.577
I feel left out."

19:21.619 --> 19:23.746
- Not in public anyway.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.746
- Mm-hm.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.582
I see, a real man

19:23.788 --> 19:26.582
doesn't express his feelings.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.293
Oh, I'm not gonna sit

19:26.624 --> 19:29.293
around and tell everybody

19:29.335 --> 19:31.921
that I-I feel like

19:29.335 --> 19:31.921
I'm being rejected and ignored.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.881
I mean, then everyone go, "Aw"

19:33.923 --> 19:35.466
and hug me and everything.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.677
You feel rejected and ignored?

19:37.718 --> 19:38.886
(in unison)

19:37.718 --> 19:38.886
Aw.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.471
See, see.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.471
I told you, I told you.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.641
Oh, honey, come on,

19:41.681 --> 19:43.641
is it so terrible

19:43.683 --> 19:46.019
to have your friends care

19:43.683 --> 19:46.019
about your feelings?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.521
Ah.. Actually, no.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.065
You know, I mean,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.065
to be honest with you..

19:51.107 --> 19:52.817
...it was kinda nice.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.276
(in unison)

19:52.859 --> 19:54.276
Aw!

19:54.318 --> 19:56.278
Not that nice. Not that nice.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.405
Alright, class,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.405
let's show Mr. Tanner

19:58.447 --> 20:00.240
how our projects turned out.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.368
Who wants to go first?

20:02.409 --> 20:03.661
How about you, Teddy?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.622
Okay, I'll give you a hand.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.832
Great.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.712
This is my

20:09.834 --> 20:12.712
new best friend, Denise.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.093
I like her because

20:15.965 --> 20:19.093
she laughs at all my jokes..

20:19.135 --> 20:21.095
...even when they're not funny.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.723
[laughing]

20:29.395 --> 20:32.106
- That wasn't funny.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.106
- It was to me.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.608
See?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.657
And Teddy would

20:39.655 --> 20:41.657
be my best friend

20:41.699 --> 20:44.618
even if he didn't have Snickles.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.829
Which he always does.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.375
Thank you, Denise,

20:49.832 --> 20:51.375
that was very good.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.211
A bit vindictive, but-but good.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.922
Maybe later you'll explain me

20:53.252 --> 20:55.922
what a Snickle is?

20:55.963 --> 20:58.174
Okay, Michelle, sweetie,

20:55.963 --> 20:58.174
would you like to go next?

20:58.216 --> 21:00.259
- I guess so.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.259
- 'Good. Come on up, honey.'

21:02.970 --> 21:05.264
- Okay, I'll give you a hand.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.264
- It goes this way.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.391
Oh, it goes this way. Okay?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.228
[children laughing]

21:12.897 --> 21:17.110
This...is my best friend.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.569
His name is Comet.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.989
You can't have

21:18.611 --> 21:21.989
a dog best friend.

21:22.031 --> 21:26.619
- Why not?

21:22.031 --> 21:26.619
- He has too many legs.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.829
Well, I would have

21:26.660 --> 21:28.829
had people friends

21:28.871 --> 21:31.124
but you guys left me.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.584
'Cause you wanted

21:31.165 --> 21:33.584
my pencil case.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.211
Yeah, greedy, greedy.

21:35.253 --> 21:39.006
Well, I was trying to be fair,

21:35.253 --> 21:39.006
friend leavers.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.716
Dog tracer.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.596
Teddy, Michelle, Denise,

21:42.718 --> 21:45.596
that's enough.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.807
Yeah, that's right.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.807
Kids, you know what?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.809
I-I think you're missing

21:47.848 --> 21:49.809
the whole spirit

21:49.850 --> 21:51.769
of project "best friend."

21:51.811 --> 21:54.021
Now, you guys all

21:51.811 --> 21:54.021
like each other.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.523
There's no reason why

21:54.063 --> 21:56.523
you can't all be best friends.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.485
But I thought you could

21:56.565 --> 21:59.485
only have one best friend?

21:59.526 --> 22:00.903
No, that's not true.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.488
Joey used to be my

22:00.945 --> 22:02.488
old best friend

22:02.529 --> 22:04.115
and now Jesse's my

22:02.529 --> 22:04.115
new best friend.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.159
Now-now we're all

22:04.157 --> 22:06.159
three best friends.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.952
We're kind of like

22:06.200 --> 22:07.952
"The Three Musketeers."

22:07.994 --> 22:09.745
Except without, you know,

22:07.994 --> 22:09.745
the-the swords

22:09.787 --> 22:12.623
and the-and the funny hats

22:09.787 --> 22:12.623
and-and the tights.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.000
Except on dress-up day.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.460
[chuckles]

22:16.502 --> 22:18.712
I'm kidding.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.424
Are you saying that three people

22:18.754 --> 22:22.424
can be best friends?

22:22.466 --> 22:24.260
Yeah, if you wanna be.

22:24.302 --> 22:27.138
Sure, best friends are people

22:24.302 --> 22:27.138
who like to share things

22:27.180 --> 22:29.640
and they-and they care

22:27.180 --> 22:29.640
about each other.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.350
And they just like

22:29.682 --> 22:32.350
spending fun time together.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.436
Like on dress-up day?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.190
I was kidding.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.776
Okay, let's vote.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.611
Who wants to be best friends?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.322
[cheering]

22:45.739 --> 22:49.243
Okay, best friends again.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.829
And we don't have to give

22:49.285 --> 22:51.829
each other anything.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.706
Unless we want to.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.624
[chuckles]

22:55.666 --> 22:56.834
I got Snickles.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.252
- Do you have red?

22:56.876 --> 22:58.252
- I like green.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.130
Uh, let's put those away

22:58.294 --> 23:01.130
until after school.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.342
Well, Miss Barnes, first can

23:01.172 --> 23:04.342
I take one quick look at them?

23:04.382 --> 23:06.927
What are these Snickles?

23:04.382 --> 23:06.927
Let me see. Wow.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.972
Sugar, sugar, sugar..

23:13.100 --> 23:15.477
♪ Aah aah aah aah ♪

23:34.538 --> 23:38.209
♪ Aah aah aah aah ♪

23:38.251 --> 23:40.502
♪ Do-be-do-ba-ba-da ♪
