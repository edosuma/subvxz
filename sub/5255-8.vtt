WEBVTT

00:00.092 --> 00:01.775
Previously on Dominion...

00:01.808 --> 00:04.893
Gabriel's massing for another war.

00:04.934 --> 00:07.750
And like Gabriel, some of
them have always hated man.

00:10.925 --> 00:13.811
You are the chosen one.

00:13.844 --> 00:16.129
It's time for a family meeting.

00:16.163 --> 00:18.240
How could you keep the
child a secret from us?

00:18.273 --> 00:20.884
Does the child know
about your colorful past?

00:20.917 --> 00:23.326
I'm taking the high road,
waiting for the child

00:23.359 --> 00:26.126
to find his true nature
and come to me on his own.

00:26.159 --> 00:29.679
It is my great pleasure
to announce the engagement

00:29.720 --> 00:33.096
of Claire Riesen to William Whele.

00:33.129 --> 00:34.821
I am not marrying William Whele.

00:34.854 --> 00:36.579
Because you are in love with Alex.

00:36.612 --> 00:38.270
You're gonna marry William.

00:38.308 --> 00:40.241
I need to look out for the city.

00:40.275 --> 00:43.738
I know when someone's
hiding something, and...

00:43.779 --> 00:47.383
you are guilty as charged.

00:51.545 --> 00:53.247
I had no idea there
were higher angels hiding

00:53.279 --> 00:54.845
within the city walls.

00:54.886 --> 00:56.915
You told me you'd never lie to me.

00:56.948 --> 00:58.342
You just neglected to tell me

00:58.383 --> 01:02.182
that one of my closest
friends is a higher angel.

01:02.215 --> 01:03.848
The angels took everything from us,

01:03.881 --> 01:06.242
and there are idiots
who still worship them.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.374
We all have faith that you can be saved.

01:10.479 --> 01:12.175
As soon as this wedding is over,

01:12.208 --> 01:14.441
you are gonna tell the city
that you have done everything

01:14.474 --> 01:17.068
that you possibly can, and
then you're gonna step down.

01:17.109 --> 01:19.404
Your brother told me things about you,

01:19.445 --> 01:21.242
things about your past.

01:21.275 --> 01:22.840
Is it true?

01:22.873 --> 01:25.340
We're not done here!

01:25.373 --> 01:28.276
We have to engage this
threat of higher angels

01:28.309 --> 01:30.740
in any and all ways available to us.

01:30.780 --> 01:33.009
How can we spend the treasury
funds on detection methods

01:33.042 --> 01:34.942
that may never exist? I mean,

01:34.975 --> 01:38.680
we have no way of knowing if there
is a way to detect these archangels.

01:38.713 --> 01:40.414
Whoa, hold up there, man.

01:40.447 --> 01:41.581
I need to speak with the Senate.

01:41.614 --> 01:43.116
- What the hell is he doing?
- Guards! Guards!

01:43.149 --> 01:44.316
It's important. It's important.

01:44.349 --> 01:46.280
- It's about Michael.
- It can wait.

01:46.313 --> 01:49.049
- I'm not sure it can, sir.
- Let him go.

01:49.082 --> 01:50.789
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

01:50.822 --> 01:52.792
He can say it somewhere else.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.028
I have two minutes of time left.

01:55.061 --> 01:57.727
I cede my time to the soldier.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.987
I want to hear this information he has

02:01.028 --> 02:02.351
about the Archangels.

02:05.653 --> 02:07.461
My name is Alex Lannon,

02:07.494 --> 02:10.393
Sergeant First Class, Archangel Corps.

02:10.425 --> 02:12.128
I've served under Michael's command

02:12.161 --> 02:14.192
for the last 7 1/2 years.

02:14.224 --> 02:16.892
What earth-shattering
event gave you the feeling

02:16.925 --> 02:18.459
that you could barge into this chamber?

02:18.492 --> 02:20.257
Michael has lied to the Senate.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.561
To all of us.

02:23.594 --> 02:26.371
He has knowingly been keeping
higher angels hidden in Vega...

02:26.404 --> 02:27.531
I knew it.

02:27.572 --> 02:29.305
Ever since the walls were built.

02:29.338 --> 02:30.472
That's absurd.

02:30.505 --> 02:31.671
Where is his evidence?

02:31.704 --> 02:33.607
The maid in House Riesen...

02:33.640 --> 02:35.576
- That's preposterous!
- The angel that killed

02:35.609 --> 02:36.904
a 10-year-old
girl.

02:36.945 --> 02:39.911
Michael personally supplied
her with a citizen I.D.

02:39.944 --> 02:41.944
seven years ago.

02:41.977 --> 02:43.752
Are you suggesting that
Michael was complicit

02:43.785 --> 02:45.814
in the attack?

02:45.847 --> 02:47.716
Sir, I don't know.

02:47.749 --> 02:49.312
There must be an
explanation for all of this.

02:49.345 --> 02:51.246
Michael's dedicated his life to humans.

02:51.279 --> 02:53.348
Then why has he killed so many of them?

02:53.381 --> 02:56.744
Michael didn't always protect us.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.816
There was a time he massacred us.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.119
Sergeant, do you have any proof?

03:03.152 --> 03:05.550
Yes, his words.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.388
He opened up to me. He
confessed to all of it.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.586
And there's more.

03:10.619 --> 03:12.985
For the last seven years,

03:13.026 --> 03:16.822
Michael has hidden a higher
angel in the Archangel Corps,

03:16.855 --> 03:20.220
someone who is supposed
to protect all of us.

03:20.261 --> 03:21.892
Give us a name. Who?

03:21.925 --> 03:24.362
Her name is Noma Banks.

03:37.668 --> 03:40.297
Alex Lannon just testified
before the Senate.

03:41.736 --> 03:43.901
What did he say?

03:43.934 --> 03:46.204
He told us things.

03:46.237 --> 03:48.634
Things even I never knew about you.

03:48.667 --> 03:51.303
I should never have trusted him.

03:51.336 --> 03:54.270
The Senate's voted to begin
hearings to remove you.

03:54.303 --> 03:56.373
There's talk of forced exile.

03:56.406 --> 03:58.436
I'll save them the trouble.

04:04.212 --> 04:05.844
Is it true?

04:05.877 --> 04:07.348
What do you think?

04:11.555 --> 04:14.519
I need you to continue to protect Louis.

04:14.552 --> 04:15.783
He's a good soul.

04:15.816 --> 04:18.254
He's done nothing wrong.

04:18.286 --> 04:19.822
If they expose him,

04:19.855 --> 04:21.789
he'll only be executed by the Senate.

04:21.822 --> 04:25.590
Please, Becca, keep him safe.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.258
You have my word.

04:32.996 --> 04:36.944
You wondered if I was capable of love.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.208
I hope you know the answer to that now.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.500
- After all I've done for you.
- Guards!

05:03.533 --> 05:05.900
Get off me.

05:07.635 --> 05:09.538
Archangel... stand down!

05:26.491 --> 05:29.729
When we join with Gabriel...

05:29.762 --> 05:32.497
He will have joined with us.

05:32.530 --> 05:36.566
When we offer him solemn loyalty...

05:36.599 --> 05:38.672
He will save us.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.938
When we are broken...

05:40.978 --> 05:45.281
We are made stronger in our broken places.

05:45.314 --> 05:47.574
When we are stronger...

05:47.607 --> 05:49.539
We are worthy.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.209
When we are worthy...

05:51.242 --> 05:54.012
We are safe.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.295
It's too much. Thank you.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.633
Could you leave us for a minute?

06:06.666 --> 06:08.772
Thank you.

06:10.973 --> 06:12.613
You wanted to see me?

06:12.646 --> 06:14.615
Yes, I heard about
Michael. I can't believe it.

06:14.648 --> 06:18.247
Going up in front of the Senate
can't have been easy for you.

06:18.288 --> 06:20.687
You did the right thing, Alex.

06:22.624 --> 06:25.157
I got to say, I...

06:25.189 --> 06:27.861
I never thought I'd see
you in a wedding dress.

06:30.633 --> 06:34.398
You look really nice.

06:34.431 --> 06:36.200
I got to go.

06:36.241 --> 06:40.102
I should have gone with you
that night after the jubilee.

06:40.143 --> 06:41.838
You, me, and Bix, we should
have gone to New Delphi,

06:41.871 --> 06:43.039
- but I screwed it up...
- We're past this.

06:43.079 --> 06:44.313
and it's because my father instilled

06:44.346 --> 06:45.714
this stupid sense of
responsibility inside of me.

06:45.747 --> 06:47.187
What do you want me to do, huh?

06:47.220 --> 06:49.958
Throw you over my shoulder and
just sneak you out of the city?

06:49.991 --> 06:51.454
No, of course not.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.127
You're the one who
convinced me not to run away

06:53.160 --> 06:54.729
from who I am, from what I have to do.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.697
- What are you doing, Alex?
- Trying to end this war.

06:56.730 --> 06:59.703
Oh. How? By evicting eight-balls?

06:59.736 --> 07:01.368
How's that working out for you?

07:01.401 --> 07:02.736
It wasn't so great for my mother, was it?

07:02.769 --> 07:04.040
I was just trying to help you.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.745
Yeah, well, I didn't ask for your help.

07:05.778 --> 07:07.881
What did you invite me here for?

07:07.914 --> 07:09.113
Don't you have somewhere to be?

07:09.146 --> 07:10.209
- A wedding?
- Yes.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.746
To someone that you don't love?

07:11.787 --> 07:13.115
This is bigger than me and William.

07:13.156 --> 07:15.691
- This is about the people.
- The people?

07:15.724 --> 07:17.188
It's not about the power?

07:17.221 --> 07:18.524
Are you serious?

07:18.557 --> 07:20.595
- Lady of the City.
- No.

07:20.628 --> 07:22.595
Do you honestly think I would
want to sit in that senate

07:22.628 --> 07:24.867
if it wasn't to change things?

07:24.900 --> 07:27.901
I don't know, Claire.

07:27.934 --> 07:29.605
I can't believe you.

07:47.197 --> 07:48.828
Welcome to Vega, ladies.

07:55.138 --> 07:56.832
We come bearing solemn news.

08:05.272 --> 08:08.174
Evelyn.

08:08.207 --> 08:10.709
You did what had to be done.

08:10.742 --> 08:13.116
You've earned Vega's trust.

08:13.149 --> 08:15.650
You are a courageous woman, Arika.

08:15.683 --> 08:18.018
Evelyn was courageous.

08:18.051 --> 08:22.188
In a world dominated by men,
she built a city of women.

08:22.221 --> 08:23.693
When our faith was lost,

08:23.726 --> 08:26.799
she taught us to honor the divine feminine.

08:29.504 --> 08:31.831
I will miss her.

08:45.174 --> 08:46.510
You're late.

08:46.543 --> 08:47.773
Head winds.

08:47.806 --> 08:49.372
You know, my shoulder still hurts.

08:49.413 --> 08:50.843
You... have claws.

08:50.876 --> 08:51.978
It had to look convincing.

08:52.011 --> 08:53.577
Gabriel's spies could be anywhere.

08:53.610 --> 08:54.777
- Well, it did.
- Good.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.049
Everyone from the Lord of the City

08:56.082 --> 08:57.312
to the V-1s on the street,

08:57.345 --> 09:01.417
they believe that I turned against you.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.352
You think it's not gonna work?

09:03.385 --> 09:05.223
My brother's not easily fooled, Alex.

09:05.256 --> 09:07.591
He wants the chosen one,
that's what he's gonna get.

09:07.624 --> 09:09.486
It won't be that simple.

09:09.527 --> 09:11.189
I should do this myself.

09:11.222 --> 09:14.155
No, he'll never let
his guard down with you.

09:14.188 --> 09:15.859
I'll get him to trust me.

09:15.892 --> 09:17.458
I'll get close enough to gut him.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.994
If you get close enough to stab him,

09:19.027 --> 09:20.698
he'll take you down with
him. You'll both be dead.

09:20.731 --> 09:23.200
If it means ending this
war, I'll take my chances.

09:27.829 --> 09:31.731
My mother, Jeep...

09:31.772 --> 09:34.372
they sacrificed their lives.

09:34.405 --> 09:36.674
Maybe everything you've taught me,

09:36.708 --> 09:38.009
all the training...

09:41.637 --> 09:43.309
It's come to this.

10:02.690 --> 10:05.158
Sometimes when it's
quiet, I imagine the sound

10:05.191 --> 10:09.158
of the waves crashing,
spray against my face,

10:09.191 --> 10:12.828
the smell of salt.

10:12.861 --> 10:15.197
I miss home.

10:20.869 --> 10:23.236
I missed you.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.737
I missed you too, Uriel.

10:33.094 --> 10:34.621
You do know how to make a woman wait.

10:34.662 --> 10:35.830
Where have you been?

10:35.863 --> 10:37.126
You know my brothers.

10:37.159 --> 10:39.496
Such a drain on my time.

10:41.998 --> 10:44.605
When do I get to meet Claire?

10:44.638 --> 10:46.733
Soon. When she's alone.

10:46.773 --> 10:51.304
If you're right about her...

10:51.337 --> 10:53.336
it changes everything.

10:53.369 --> 10:56.440
When has my intuition ever failed you?

10:56.473 --> 10:58.639
Hmm?

10:58.680 --> 11:01.342
You may not be the only intuitive one here.

11:01.375 --> 11:04.349
Does anyone suspect who you really are?

11:04.382 --> 11:06.950
The men in Vega are no
different than anywhere else,

11:06.983 --> 11:08.583
too arrogant to consider the notion

11:08.624 --> 11:10.223
that they're being deceived.

11:15.423 --> 11:19.662
Still, if they found
out who you really are,

11:19.695 --> 11:22.660
they'd string you up in the town square.

11:22.701 --> 11:24.961
You'd be the most beautiful martyr

11:24.994 --> 11:26.897
the Cradle has ever seen.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.863
I'm not worried.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.103
They think they have
Evelyn's head on a pillow.

11:32.136 --> 11:34.071
They have no idea that I'm alive and well

11:34.104 --> 11:37.206
and living in their lord's mansion.

11:41.816 --> 11:44.279
And do you, Claire,
take the hand of William

11:44.312 --> 11:47.719
and promise to love, cherish,
and nourish his every breath

11:47.752 --> 11:50.990
until you breathe your last?

11:51.024 --> 11:53.190
I do.

11:53.223 --> 11:56.494
Then by the power vested
in me by the City of Vega

11:56.527 --> 11:59.695
and under the embrace of the Savior,

11:59.728 --> 12:03.602
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

12:20.596 --> 12:23.298
Claire, I want you to know

12:23.331 --> 12:26.738
that my expectations tonight

12:26.771 --> 12:30.769
are no different than they were last night.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.780
It's okay.

12:40.823 --> 12:42.960
Thank you.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.362
No, really, thank you.

12:55.737 --> 12:57.273
Why here?

12:57.306 --> 13:00.640
Gabriel will suspect a trap
if we're anywhere near Vega.

13:00.673 --> 13:02.311
So I'm supposed to kill Gabriel

13:02.344 --> 13:04.545
and end this war at a water park?

13:04.578 --> 13:06.785
Just keep your focus on the blade.

13:06.818 --> 13:09.017
Those things Gabriel said about you,

13:09.050 --> 13:11.553
the Flood, I don't believe any of it.

13:11.586 --> 13:13.186
You should.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.459
So many lives, I've lost count.

13:15.492 --> 13:18.363
All cut short by my sword.

13:18.396 --> 13:20.363
So it's true.

13:20.396 --> 13:23.068
My father would send me
out to exact his wrath.

13:23.101 --> 13:26.001
I was carrying out his command.

13:26.034 --> 13:28.137
Couldn't you have said no?

13:28.170 --> 13:31.010
I could have, but I didn't.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.780
I never hesitated, not once.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.516
Why?

13:37.548 --> 13:38.986
I'm loathe to admit it,

13:39.019 --> 13:42.417
but the blood, the violence...

13:42.450 --> 13:45.153
It was intoxicating.

13:45.186 --> 13:46.794
You weren't always this way.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.858
There was a boy, barely nine years old.

13:49.891 --> 13:53.163
I slew his father, and
I was about to slay him

13:53.196 --> 13:56.668
when my brother and sister
finally caught up with me.

13:56.701 --> 13:58.101
Gabriel and Uriel had been trying to stop

13:58.142 --> 14:00.278
my killing spree for decades.

14:00.311 --> 14:02.373
They thought father had gone too far,

14:02.414 --> 14:05.447
that I had gone too far.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.351
And they beat me within an inch of my life.

14:09.384 --> 14:11.392
Wait.

14:11.425 --> 14:14.391
Gabriel defended humans?

14:14.424 --> 14:16.126
I was lying in that field for days,

14:16.159 --> 14:17.623
too weak to move.

14:17.663 --> 14:19.927
And suddenly water trickled into my mouth.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.365
It was the same boy.

14:22.398 --> 14:26.268
He stumbled upon me while
he was herding his goats.

14:26.301 --> 14:28.270
When I was well enough to speak,

14:28.303 --> 14:29.873
I asked him if he recognized me,

14:29.906 --> 14:31.377
and he nodded.

14:31.410 --> 14:34.680
Then I asked him why he saved my life.

14:34.713 --> 14:36.783
What did he say?

14:40.320 --> 14:44.755
He said, "Because it was
the right thing to do."

14:44.796 --> 14:46.564
That's when I realized my father's commands

14:46.597 --> 14:47.996
weren't always straightforward.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.830
Sometimes they were a test.

14:50.871 --> 14:54.039
In this instance, a test I had failed.

14:57.242 --> 15:00.450
How do you live with yourself?

15:03.115 --> 15:06.616
Your rise is my redemption, Alex.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.920
Don't let me down.

15:12.221 --> 15:13.852
No pressure.

15:24.437 --> 15:26.564
Hi.

15:35.074 --> 15:36.705
Please, don't look at me like that.

15:36.738 --> 15:38.914
Like what?

15:38.947 --> 15:40.438
Where's Furiad?

15:40.479 --> 15:42.205
Pleasant View, 201.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.779
How did you get him there?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.517
You and Furiad?

15:55.991 --> 15:58.461
It was eons ago, Alex.

15:58.494 --> 16:01.000
I knew he'd agree to meet.

16:01.033 --> 16:03.835
I just didn't tell him
I'd be a little late.

16:03.868 --> 16:07.671
Ever since I met you, it's all been lies.

16:07.704 --> 16:09.006
No.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.271
It wasn't all lies, Alex.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.574
So, in basic training, when we first met,

16:13.608 --> 16:15.542
and you switched bunks next to mine,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.380
it wasn't because Ethan was a snorer.

16:17.413 --> 16:18.947
You were keeping tabs on me.

16:18.981 --> 16:22.083
Ethan snored, like a dying whale.

16:22.116 --> 16:25.018
You heard him.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.755
Look.

16:27.788 --> 16:30.459
I'm sorry.

16:30.492 --> 16:32.755
I wish I could have been straight with you.

16:32.795 --> 16:34.458
I was just following Michael's orders.

16:34.491 --> 16:35.825
He told me to take care of you.

16:35.858 --> 16:37.993
Yeah, you took care of me all right.

16:38.026 --> 16:40.464
He didn't tell me to sleep with you.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.232
That was all me.

16:47.437 --> 16:49.364
Come on, Alex.

16:49.405 --> 16:51.068
It's me.

16:51.101 --> 16:52.100
Hey.

16:52.141 --> 16:55.205
We have to work together? Fine.

16:55.246 --> 16:58.681
But let's not pretend like
everything's back to normal.

17:11.597 --> 17:14.003
Noma?

17:26.921 --> 17:28.815
Show mercy.

17:28.856 --> 17:31.350
Let me ask you, what
would Gabriel do to you

17:31.391 --> 17:33.254
if he knew you were having
a tryst with my lieutenant?

17:33.287 --> 17:35.188
Hmm?

17:35.221 --> 17:38.090
I'm sure your death would
neither be swift nor painless.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.521
What do you want?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.766
It appears the Angel's dorsal scapula,

17:47.799 --> 17:48.862
where the wings retract,

17:48.895 --> 17:50.502
contain tissue that's penetrable.

17:50.535 --> 17:52.598
That's the autopsy. What about Lab Two?

17:52.631 --> 17:54.967
We just made an interesting discovery.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.376
Turns out their muscles are
vulnerable to electric shock,

17:57.409 --> 17:59.513
just like ours.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.614
We can induce temporary paralysis.

18:05.953 --> 18:07.489
Any word from Michael?

18:07.522 --> 18:09.354
After all he's done for Vega,

18:09.386 --> 18:10.785
all the lives he's saved,

18:10.825 --> 18:13.026
this is the way they show their gratitude.

18:13.059 --> 18:16.166
Run him out of the town he helped build.

18:16.199 --> 18:19.038
I brought your medication.

18:19.071 --> 18:20.577
No, no, I don't need that.

18:20.610 --> 18:21.777
I'm...

18:21.810 --> 18:23.575
I'm leaving Vega.

18:23.608 --> 18:25.038
What are you talking about?

18:25.078 --> 18:27.340
I refuse to spend the
remaining years of my life

18:27.373 --> 18:30.878
cooped up in some attic making
tables and goddamn chairs.

18:30.911 --> 18:32.920
You don't have to.

18:32.953 --> 18:34.721
You're an elder statesman, Edward.

18:34.754 --> 18:37.320
We need your insight.

18:37.353 --> 18:39.525
Any insight I had has
been imparted long ago.

18:39.558 --> 18:41.661
You're ready, Becca. You
and Claire, you're ready.

18:41.694 --> 18:42.988
Edward, we need you.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.156
Not like this, you don't.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.828
I've never stood still.

18:45.861 --> 18:48.499
I'm not about to start now.

18:48.532 --> 18:50.827
I take it you haven't told Claire.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.498
She'd just try to talk me out of it.

18:53.531 --> 18:54.730
Where are you gonna go?

18:54.770 --> 18:57.338
There's nowhere safe
outside of these walls.

18:57.371 --> 18:59.571
It's suicide, Edward.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.510
If I can make it to New Delphi,

19:01.543 --> 19:03.810
I like my chances.

19:05.977 --> 19:07.374
Help her, Becca.

19:09.709 --> 19:13.076
Take care of her, for me.

19:18.995 --> 19:20.762
You heard him?

19:20.795 --> 19:22.730
His wings. Furiad's on board.

19:22.763 --> 19:25.131
They're waiting for me at the peak.

19:29.065 --> 19:30.064
Here.

19:30.104 --> 19:31.399
What's this?

19:31.432 --> 19:33.670
Scotch, 18-year-old
single malt.

19:33.703 --> 19:35.869
You can make a toast at my funeral.

19:35.902 --> 19:37.711
I love the confidence.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.881
Gabriel's not gonna be throwing me

19:38.914 --> 19:40.412
a welcome home party.

19:40.453 --> 19:42.586
There's a chance I might
never make it out of his aerie.

19:42.619 --> 19:44.016
Noma.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.280
Noma. Noma!

19:45.321 --> 19:46.985
What?

19:47.018 --> 19:48.153
If you don't want to go through with this,

19:48.186 --> 19:49.584
I totally understand.

19:49.625 --> 19:52.453
I've come this far. You
think I'm giving up now?

19:52.486 --> 19:54.555
You have to promise me,

19:54.588 --> 19:57.825
if things go sideways,
don't try to protect me.

19:57.858 --> 20:01.485
Whatever you need to do to
take Gabriel down, you do it.

20:01.526 --> 20:03.093
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just promise me.

20:03.126 --> 20:05.358
I promise you.

20:26.670 --> 20:30.369
Madame Arika, I am so
sorry to hear about Evelyn.

20:30.410 --> 20:33.509
Though it pains me, I know
Helena will be better for it.

20:33.549 --> 20:37.517
Our holy priestess Laurel
has just arrived from Helena.

20:37.550 --> 20:40.515
She would like to offer
you a prayer of matrimony.

20:40.556 --> 20:42.020
Well, I would be honored.

20:42.053 --> 20:44.389
Lady Riesen,

20:44.422 --> 20:47.495
everyone in Helena celebrates
your ascension to power.

20:47.528 --> 20:51.230
One day soon, we hope you
will come and visit us.

20:51.263 --> 20:53.903
Well, I would love to.

20:53.936 --> 20:57.533
Oh, thank you.

20:57.574 --> 21:01.973
May the loving tides
carry you both in her arms.

21:02.006 --> 21:04.010
Hmm.

21:09.512 --> 21:11.280
Bless you.

21:19.514 --> 21:20.786
You were right.

21:20.819 --> 21:23.016
She's carrying the chosen one's child.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.383
Nuclear power seems almost trivial now.

21:25.416 --> 21:28.319
We have plenty of time to get their energy.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.162
For now, we just need to spirit Claire

21:30.195 --> 21:31.629
and the unborn child to Helena.

21:31.662 --> 21:33.999
And if Alex is like other men,

21:34.032 --> 21:35.933
he'll follow them wherever we take them.

21:35.966 --> 21:37.973
And when he's able to
translate the markings,

21:38.006 --> 21:40.872
I will learn how to defeat my brothers,

21:40.913 --> 21:43.008
end the bloodshed once and for all.

21:43.049 --> 21:44.977
A world at peace.

21:45.018 --> 21:47.020
Just as my father wanted.

22:10.444 --> 22:14.346
Look who's here,
Michael's loyal lieutenant.

22:16.283 --> 22:18.682
Archangel Gabriel.

22:18.715 --> 22:20.753
Bold move,

22:20.786 --> 22:24.155
showing up within my blade's reach.

22:24.188 --> 22:25.924
I have nowhere else to turn.

22:25.957 --> 22:28.324
Michael attacked Alex.

22:28.365 --> 22:30.459
He's reverted back to his old ways.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.793
Only a matter of time.

22:31.826 --> 22:35.928
The child has lost
complete faith in Michael.

22:35.969 --> 22:38.167
And honestly, so have I.

22:41.472 --> 22:43.536
So why come to me?

22:45.746 --> 22:47.144
Alex wants to meet you.

22:47.177 --> 22:48.942
I don't believe her.

22:48.975 --> 22:51.078
She's speaking the truth.

22:51.111 --> 22:53.080
Oh, really, Furiad?

22:53.113 --> 22:54.647
He's found out about Michael's past,

22:54.680 --> 22:55.782
and he's furious.

22:55.815 --> 22:59.219
He wants to hear your side of the story.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.555
Very well.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.757
I'll meet with the boy.

23:02.790 --> 23:04.658
Thank you, Archangel.

23:06.124 --> 23:08.828
What?

23:08.861 --> 23:12.467
You didn't expect I'd
just walk into some trap.

23:16.668 --> 23:18.668
Lock her up, Felicia.

23:26.576 --> 23:28.574
Dad?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.486
Have you seen my father?

23:35.519 --> 23:37.683
- No, ma'am, I haven't.
- Okay.

23:42.820 --> 23:44.753
Sir, you're not supposed to leave the walls

23:44.786 --> 23:46.953
without a security detail.

23:46.994 --> 23:48.888
Watch me.

24:14.926 --> 24:16.054
Jeep?

24:16.095 --> 24:18.559
Shh.

24:18.592 --> 24:20.327
- How did you get here?
- Quiet.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.567
No one can know I'm here.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.133
Come on.

24:33.204 --> 24:35.308
Beat me pretty good before.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.076
Any better now?

24:37.109 --> 24:39.180
Take it.

24:39.213 --> 24:41.916
What are you doing?

24:41.949 --> 24:43.582
What would you give up to bring me back?

24:43.623 --> 24:44.750
To bring Bixby back?

24:44.783 --> 24:46.190
Anything.

24:46.223 --> 24:47.390
Everything.

24:47.423 --> 24:49.191
You haven't learned a thing.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.527
It's your destiny to save humanity,

24:52.560 --> 24:54.166
all of us, not some of us.

24:54.199 --> 24:55.294
I don't understand.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.334
It's time to cut yourself free, son.

25:02.806 --> 25:04.006
You have to be alone in this, Alex.

25:04.039 --> 25:05.805
It's the only way.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.108
You'll never be the chosen one.

25:07.141 --> 25:08.477
I am the chosen one!

25:08.510 --> 25:10.046
No, you're not. Not yet.

25:30.736 --> 25:32.602
Oh, no. Oh, Dad...

25:32.643 --> 25:35.674
Dad.

25:35.707 --> 25:37.275
Dad.

25:37.308 --> 25:41.252
Dad!

25:41.285 --> 25:44.280
No!

25:47.449 --> 25:49.553
What are you doing here?

25:49.586 --> 25:50.786
He's coming.

25:50.827 --> 25:52.490
Gabriel's not coming.

25:52.523 --> 25:53.794
He should have been here by now.

25:53.827 --> 25:56.466
Something's off.

25:56.499 --> 25:57.962
Let's go back to Vega.

26:03.234 --> 26:05.400
Perimeter Breach.

26:07.535 --> 26:09.133
Perimeter Breach.

26:09.174 --> 26:12.572
Halt!

26:12.606 --> 26:14.044
Got I.D.?

26:14.077 --> 26:16.139
I do.

26:19.381 --> 26:21.851
Oh, shit.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.115
Open fire!

26:42.760 --> 26:45.094
My name is Gabriel.

26:49.528 --> 26:52.304
I surrender.

26:53.305 --> 26:54.600
Where's Riesen?

26:54.640 --> 26:56.471
- He's gone.
- What?

26:56.504 --> 26:58.576
We need to focus on the task at hand.

26:58.609 --> 26:59.913
Every minute Gabriel is alive

26:59.946 --> 27:01.945
is an opportunity for him to strike.

27:01.978 --> 27:04.051
He needs to be executed immediately.

27:04.084 --> 27:05.316
He's an archangel.

27:05.349 --> 27:06.916
Do we even know how to kill him,

27:06.957 --> 27:08.788
short of a nuclear bomb?

27:08.821 --> 27:10.021
I can only infer,

27:10.054 --> 27:11.591
based on the autopsies of higher angels,

27:11.632 --> 27:13.160
but their bodies will shatter

27:13.202 --> 27:15.171
with a large enough concussive blast.

27:15.204 --> 27:16.739
I have no reason to believe

27:16.772 --> 27:18.435
that an archangel would be any different.

27:18.476 --> 27:19.939
You want to blow him up?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.444
Yes.

27:21.477 --> 27:24.811
I propose we seal him in a concrete vault

27:24.844 --> 27:28.380
surrounded with as much
C4 as we possibly can,

27:28.413 --> 27:31.487
and we detonate.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.220
Claire, I think your first
instinct is the right one.

27:34.254 --> 27:35.492
Let's interrogate him.

27:35.525 --> 27:36.692
Let's learn everything we can.

27:36.725 --> 27:38.156
We have him in custody.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.797
It does seem like a wasted
opportunity if we don't try,

27:40.830 --> 27:42.062
after what happened with Felicia.

27:42.103 --> 27:43.168
The risk is too high to wait.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.474
But think of the reward.

27:44.507 --> 27:47.610
We could uncover every
higher angel in the city,

27:47.643 --> 27:49.376
securing Vega's future.

27:49.409 --> 27:50.807
Yes.

27:50.840 --> 27:54.445
Killing Gabriel now would
be shortsighted, Consul.

27:54.478 --> 27:56.046
Higher angels won't stop attacking

27:56.079 --> 27:57.110
just because he's dead.

27:57.151 --> 27:58.678
You've wanted to banish Michael

27:58.718 --> 28:01.117
for as long as I've known you, David.

28:01.150 --> 28:03.684
And now you want to keep Gabriel alive

28:03.717 --> 28:06.389
inside our walls for intelligence?

28:06.422 --> 28:08.757
William, Becca, could
you leave us for a moment?

28:10.789 --> 28:12.893
Of course.

28:22.037 --> 28:25.876
David, Gabriel killed your wife,

28:25.909 --> 28:27.706
your kids.

28:27.739 --> 28:30.714
Why do you not want his head on a stick?

28:33.483 --> 28:36.713
I... detest him,

28:36.747 --> 28:40.218
but I can't allow my emotion

28:40.251 --> 28:42.719
to cloud my judgment.

28:42.752 --> 28:44.653
He has information we need,

28:44.686 --> 28:48.156
and we won't get another chance like this.

28:53.227 --> 28:55.658
You know, after I went to your office

28:55.691 --> 28:57.562
and I found that acolyte blindfold,

28:57.595 --> 29:00.236
I didn't really believe that it was yours.

29:00.270 --> 29:02.541
I just wanted to blackmail you.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.710
Politics, sorry.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.511
But now I have to wonder.

29:07.544 --> 29:09.079
Wonder all you want.

29:09.112 --> 29:10.983
I've investigated it myself.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.613
I traced it back to one
of my staff, a handyman.

29:13.646 --> 29:15.413
- Who?
- Paul Sanchez.

29:15.453 --> 29:19.589
There was an altar to
Gabriel in his quarters.

29:19.622 --> 29:21.695
It's handled.

29:21.728 --> 29:23.160
I'm surprised.

29:23.192 --> 29:26.166
I could no more be an angel worshipper

29:26.198 --> 29:27.765
than you or your dad, Claire.

29:30.997 --> 29:32.933
Okay.

29:32.966 --> 29:35.438
So...

29:35.471 --> 29:37.068
we learn all we can today,

29:37.109 --> 29:39.474
and then we kill him tomorrow.

29:39.507 --> 29:40.707
Sure.

29:40.740 --> 29:43.747
May he rot in whatever
there is left of hell.

29:54.047 --> 29:57.582
Surrender seems out of character for you.

29:57.623 --> 30:00.454
What would you know about my character?

30:00.487 --> 30:02.559
A great deal, actually.

30:02.592 --> 30:06.496
I was raised by the man
who defeated you in battle.

30:06.529 --> 30:08.433
Shame he's not here to greet me.

30:08.466 --> 30:10.570
I'm a big fan.

30:10.604 --> 30:12.739
The irony being it'll be his daughter

30:12.772 --> 30:14.372
who puts you to your death.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.245
This is how you play war?

30:16.278 --> 30:19.120
Your opposing general lays down his sword,

30:19.153 --> 30:22.222
and in appreciation you have him executed.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.194
A general who ruthlessly
slaughtered my people.

30:25.227 --> 30:28.732
I can't say it would be difficult.

30:28.765 --> 30:32.035
But I'm not here to talk
about your execution.

30:32.068 --> 30:34.002
I want to know how many higher angels

30:34.035 --> 30:37.308
you have hidden in Vega, and I want names.

30:37.341 --> 30:38.573
Ooh.

30:38.606 --> 30:40.381
A woman who knows what she wants.

30:40.414 --> 30:41.950
I like that.

30:41.983 --> 30:43.352
Answer the question.

30:43.385 --> 30:45.553
Whether or not I have more
personnel inside these walls

30:45.586 --> 30:48.087
is irrelevant, is it not?

30:48.120 --> 30:51.756
I've surrendered, and I'd
like to see my brother.

30:51.789 --> 30:53.259
Why?

30:53.292 --> 30:54.827
He's my family.

30:54.860 --> 30:59.490
Are you going to refuse me
a visitor on my last night?

31:04.132 --> 31:06.267
Whatever you're planning,

31:06.300 --> 31:08.908
it was a mistake to
come inside these walls.

31:08.941 --> 31:11.813
My plan is simple, Claire.

31:11.846 --> 31:13.876
I've come to end the war.

31:13.909 --> 31:17.414
All I've ever wanted is my father back.

31:17.447 --> 31:19.857
At first, I thought the way to do that

31:19.890 --> 31:21.951
was to cleanse the planet of all the humans

31:21.992 --> 31:24.962
that have repeatedly let him down.

31:24.995 --> 31:27.563
But now the chosen one has arrived.

31:27.596 --> 31:31.062
He holds my father's
final writings on his body.

31:31.095 --> 31:33.632
He can make things right again,

31:33.665 --> 31:35.570
without any more bloodshed.

31:35.603 --> 31:38.674
Shame you'll never find him.

31:38.707 --> 31:41.473
What, you mean Alex?

31:42.713 --> 31:44.607
You've seen the markings up close,

31:44.647 --> 31:46.742
haven't you?

31:46.783 --> 31:49.216
You say you know me.

31:49.249 --> 31:50.720
Well, I know you too.

31:50.753 --> 31:52.320
You don't know anything about me.

31:52.353 --> 31:54.720
Let's see.

31:54.753 --> 31:58.991
How about something small, personal,

31:59.024 --> 32:02.062
like your favorite flower?

32:02.095 --> 32:05.266
Desert sage.

32:05.299 --> 32:08.475
My father gave his
archangels many gifts, Claire,

32:08.508 --> 32:10.740
one of them being heightened senses.

32:10.773 --> 32:13.842
I can hear every breath, every movement,

32:13.875 --> 32:17.146
every tiny heartbeat.

32:27.190 --> 32:28.991
What the hell is he doing?

32:29.024 --> 32:32.224
Calling our bluff.

32:37.734 --> 32:38.732
Stand down.

32:38.765 --> 32:39.931
What the hell are you doing here?

32:39.964 --> 32:42.099
I could say the same thing about him.

32:45.266 --> 32:48.971
He's on our side, Claire. Always was.

32:49.004 --> 32:50.842
Well, Gabriel wants to see him.

32:50.875 --> 32:52.307
- Me?
- Yes.

32:52.340 --> 32:54.349
I don't trust him. Let me go in.

32:54.382 --> 32:57.045
No, it's too dangerous.

32:57.085 --> 32:58.483
Alex, he knows your name.

32:58.516 --> 33:00.050
He's the one in a cage, not us.

33:00.083 --> 33:01.553
I'm the one he wants to see.

33:01.586 --> 33:02.818
I'll go inside.

33:02.851 --> 33:04.323
Michael, we both know this is a trap.

33:04.356 --> 33:05.354
Let me go in.

33:05.387 --> 33:06.721
Let me end this once and for all.

33:06.754 --> 33:08.152
No, absolutely not.

33:08.193 --> 33:09.256
This city is on lockdown,

33:09.289 --> 33:10.528
and that cell has half a million volts

33:10.561 --> 33:11.824
running through it.

33:11.857 --> 33:13.623
Until we understand the
dangers that we face,

33:13.664 --> 33:15.232
you are not to go anywhere.

33:15.265 --> 33:17.600
Alex...

33:17.633 --> 33:18.896
I am the Lady of the City now,

33:18.937 --> 33:21.999
and that is an order.

33:22.032 --> 33:24.008
Are we clear?

33:26.778 --> 33:29.576
Yes, we're clear.

33:29.609 --> 33:31.344
Good.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.487
I'm going in.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.686
This ends now.

33:48.558 --> 33:50.829
What do you think you're doing?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.396
Is there something wrong?

33:52.429 --> 33:54.531
I saw you in that meeting.

33:54.564 --> 33:55.834
You were wavering,

33:55.868 --> 33:57.003
thinking about voting

33:57.036 --> 33:59.101
to have Gabriel executed immediately.

33:59.134 --> 34:00.468
What should I have done,

34:00.501 --> 34:03.972
made some impassioned
argument to keep him alive

34:04.005 --> 34:08.210
when Claire Riesen suspects I'm a traitor?

34:09.886 --> 34:13.516
She found the blindfold
here in our house, remember?

34:15.685 --> 34:17.924
I was protecting us.

34:17.956 --> 34:21.560
Or were you trying to protect yourself?

34:21.592 --> 34:24.127
All the while, pushing
Gabriel under the bus.

34:24.168 --> 34:26.364
You can believe what you like.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.902
It's not your doubts about
my loyalty that worry me.

34:29.935 --> 34:33.340
It's that you're blinded
by your devotion to Gabriel.

34:33.373 --> 34:35.911
I'm not blinded.

34:35.944 --> 34:38.341
I trust him.

34:38.373 --> 34:39.940
Because he values me

34:39.982 --> 34:42.076
in a way you'll never understand.

34:42.117 --> 34:45.344
Then why didn't he tell
you he was coming to Vega?

34:45.378 --> 34:48.386
Why not whisper to the
leader of your acolytes

34:48.418 --> 34:52.722
that you're gonna walk
through the gate and surrender?

34:52.755 --> 34:55.656
Are there others that he trusts more?

34:55.688 --> 34:58.993
He'll reveal his intentions
when he feels the time is right.

34:59.026 --> 35:00.994
William, believe me,

35:01.027 --> 35:03.801
it is my hope that Gabriel has been honest,

35:03.834 --> 35:07.203
but we have to allow for the possibility

35:07.235 --> 35:09.240
that he could expose us.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.640
My faith in Gabriel is as
strong as it has ever been.

35:12.673 --> 35:17.512
And it's not him that I am worried about.

35:17.545 --> 35:20.447
I'll expect you to do
everything in your power

35:20.480 --> 35:22.309
to prevent his execution.

35:35.828 --> 35:36.892
Where's Noma?

35:36.925 --> 35:38.396
In safekeeping.

35:41.067 --> 35:43.931
Sending your friend to earn my trust?

35:43.964 --> 35:47.568
I was impressed, Alex.

35:47.601 --> 35:49.031
But now I'm disappointed.

35:49.072 --> 35:52.103
You see, you're still as
close to my brother as always.

35:52.137 --> 35:54.671
You're still not learning.

35:54.704 --> 35:56.945
There's nothing you can teach me, Gabriel.

35:56.978 --> 36:00.988
Oh, there is, if you'll only listen.

36:01.021 --> 36:03.787
I am what I am.

36:03.820 --> 36:06.294
I own all my mistakes.

36:06.327 --> 36:09.231
But I'm the only one
that's never lied to you.

36:09.264 --> 36:11.064
All those closest to you, Jeep...

36:11.097 --> 36:13.033
- You think you know me.
- Michael, even Claire.

36:13.066 --> 36:14.907
You think you know who I am?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.505
You have no idea.

36:16.538 --> 36:18.138
They all use you for their own ends.

36:18.179 --> 36:19.979
You have no idea who I am!

36:20.012 --> 36:22.415
Come with me, Alex.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.490
Think about Claire.

36:28.531 --> 36:29.930
I have acolytes everywhere, Alex.

36:29.963 --> 36:31.162
If I die, she dies,

36:31.195 --> 36:34.670
along with your unborn child inside her.

36:37.473 --> 36:38.776
What did you say?

36:38.809 --> 36:40.712
That's right, Alex.

36:40.745 --> 36:42.513
You're going to be a father.

37:06.279 --> 37:08.915
I can sense you hovering.

37:08.948 --> 37:11.214
What did you say to stay Alex's hand?

37:12.424 --> 37:14.424
He did leave quickly, didn't he?

37:14.457 --> 37:17.295
You only delayed the inevitable, Gabriel.

37:23.969 --> 37:27.800
I remember yours was the
first voice I ever heard.

37:27.840 --> 37:31.007
The first moment, I was alone in darkness,

37:31.040 --> 37:33.745
but I remember you,

37:33.778 --> 37:36.282
your essence there with me.

37:36.315 --> 37:37.786
I remember.

37:37.819 --> 37:40.117
It comforted me, gave me hope.

37:40.157 --> 37:43.061
The day we were made, my other,

37:43.094 --> 37:46.356
my twin Archangel Gabriel.

37:46.397 --> 37:47.795
Only Uriel and Raphael

37:47.828 --> 37:49.994
know what it is to be joined as we are.

37:50.027 --> 37:51.931
Even the son of morning was born alone.

37:51.964 --> 37:57.006
Our bond always allowed me to
know what you were thinking.

37:57.039 --> 37:59.343
And now you only baffle me.

37:59.376 --> 38:02.814
My yin,

38:02.847 --> 38:04.350
my better half.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.651
You broke the bond first, Michael,

38:10.684 --> 38:12.252
when you stopped listening.

38:12.285 --> 38:13.685
I felt I had no choice.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.722
You know what I'm doing, Michael?

38:16.755 --> 38:18.489
I'm illuminating you,

38:18.522 --> 38:21.887
just like I tried centuries ago.

38:21.928 --> 38:24.423
Tell me, brother,

38:24.464 --> 38:27.430
have you ever doubted these humans?

38:27.463 --> 38:30.027
I mean, they're intelligent.
I'll give them that.

38:30.060 --> 38:34.599
I mean, this... this
impressive wing restraint.

38:34.632 --> 38:36.197
I mean, this must have been in the works

38:36.230 --> 38:37.693
for quite some time.

38:37.734 --> 38:39.230
What do you think it's made from?

38:39.263 --> 38:44.130
It actually... it feels
like Empyrean steel.

38:48.307 --> 38:52.506
They're up to no good, Michael.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.506
Whatever keeps you in
line, it's good in my book.

38:54.547 --> 38:56.848
Louis doesn't have to be kept in line.

38:56.881 --> 38:59.616
He's done nothing wrong.

38:59.649 --> 39:01.680
Except of course when I possessed him.

39:01.713 --> 39:03.521
What does Louis have to do with this?

39:03.554 --> 39:06.062
Well, I had another look at
the world through his eyes,

39:06.095 --> 39:09.264
and I was surprised by what I saw.

39:09.297 --> 39:12.034
A large room, high ceilings,

39:12.067 --> 39:14.970
white halls, sterile.

39:15.003 --> 39:16.841
Skylight was a nice touch,

39:16.874 --> 39:19.272
but what I remember the most

39:19.313 --> 39:22.515
was what I saw around him,

39:22.548 --> 39:25.019
the white symbol on red.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.688
How do I know any of this is true?

39:30.721 --> 39:32.854
You don't.

39:32.887 --> 39:34.222
But one of our kind

39:34.255 --> 39:37.962
is being mistreated by
your humans, Michael.

39:37.995 --> 39:39.994
The ones you love,

39:40.035 --> 39:43.099
the ones who turned you into a traitor.

39:45.404 --> 39:47.641
It seems they returned the favor.

39:56.911 --> 39:59.108
Brother.

40:05.483 --> 40:06.546
Is it true?

40:06.587 --> 40:08.584
What?

40:08.617 --> 40:09.952
The baby.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.685
Is it true?

40:14.021 --> 40:16.189
- I'm... I'm sorry, Alex.
- Claire...

40:16.222 --> 40:18.094
Look, the truth is, I wasn't
actually going to tell you.

40:18.127 --> 40:19.926
I thought it would be
better if you didn't know.

40:19.959 --> 40:21.829
How could that ever be better?

40:21.862 --> 40:24.697
Because you can't be
a father to this child.

40:27.077 --> 40:29.843
That isn't your choice to make.

40:31.674 --> 40:34.943
You have no idea what
kind of father I'd be.

40:37.678 --> 40:39.140
Yes, I do, Alex,

40:39.181 --> 40:41.274
and so do you.

40:41.315 --> 40:43.847
Alex, both of us grew up missing a parent,

40:43.879 --> 40:45.878
and neither of us wants
that to happen again.

40:45.911 --> 40:48.614
This child, our baby,

40:48.647 --> 40:52.014
is gonna grow up safe and cared for.

40:52.055 --> 40:53.054
By William?

40:53.087 --> 40:54.822
Yes. You said it yourself.

40:54.855 --> 40:57.160
Anyone close to you has
a target on their back,

40:57.193 --> 40:59.395
especially your baby,

40:59.428 --> 41:01.099
the chosen one's baby.

41:09.477 --> 41:11.537
Gabriel knows you're pregnant.

41:11.578 --> 41:12.704
Yeah, well, he's not gonna...

41:12.745 --> 41:14.206
There's acolytes everywhere.

41:14.239 --> 41:15.541
I don't care.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.478
He's not gonna be a problem any longer.

41:17.511 --> 41:18.614
Until he's dead, Claire,

41:18.647 --> 41:20.445
we need to move you to a bunker.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.917
Surround yourself with as
many guards as we can trust.

41:22.950 --> 41:24.317
What are you talking about?

41:24.350 --> 41:26.052
Alex, no, I'm not just
gonna disappear underground,

41:26.086 --> 41:27.349
not while the city is at risk.

41:27.390 --> 41:28.821
I'm not taking any risk. Call in the Corps.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.526
We need another dozen
guards up here right now.

41:30.559 --> 41:32.588
Copy that. Control...

41:32.621 --> 41:34.525
Michael.

41:34.558 --> 41:36.000
Michael, can you hear me?

41:37.768 --> 41:39.261
Michael.

41:39.301 --> 41:40.763
What?

41:40.796 --> 41:42.802
I need you at House Riesen right now.

41:42.835 --> 41:44.902
Claire needs your protection.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.438
Michael, where are you?

41:47.471 --> 41:49.511
House Thorn.

41:51.048 --> 41:52.384
Michael.

41:52.417 --> 41:56.048
Michael!

41:56.089 --> 41:58.183
Something is wrong with Michael.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.487
I got to go.

41:59.520 --> 42:03.226
Stay here.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.060
Don't take your eyes off of her.

42:05.101 --> 42:08.070
- Yes, Sergeant. Take cover.
- Got it.

42:56.791 --> 43:01.695
Michael, what is this place?

43:01.736 --> 43:03.230
Louis is here.

43:03.271 --> 43:04.901
What?

43:04.933 --> 43:07.332
Why?

43:07.373 --> 43:10.374
They're dissecting us.

43:10.407 --> 43:13.377
Be ready.

43:13.410 --> 43:16.021
Gabriel can still possess him.

43:30.250 --> 43:33.284
Michael...

43:33.317 --> 43:36.218
Michael.

43:36.251 --> 43:37.753
Louis.

43:57.112 --> 43:59.184
Michael.

44:08.996 --> 44:10.466
It's time.

44:45.293 --> 44:47.064
We're going to get you out of here.

44:47.097 --> 44:48.969
Michael.

44:49.002 --> 44:49.970
No, leave it.

44:51.635 --> 44:55.444
Michael, look at me.

44:55.477 --> 44:57.445
Look what's left of me.

44:59.350 --> 45:01.946
As my friend, please.

45:03.346 --> 45:05.152
Please.

45:07.184 --> 45:09.383
Please.

45:27.046 --> 45:29.508
When Father returns.

45:29.541 --> 45:31.243
When Father returns.

45:53.836 --> 45:56.369
You lied to me.

45:56.402 --> 45:58.033
I need to keep Vega safe.

46:02.844 --> 46:05.380
Look at the extreme measures
you've taken to do so.

46:05.413 --> 46:07.055
It's complicated, Michael.

46:07.088 --> 46:08.655
Michael!

46:08.688 --> 46:10.150
This whole time you've been using me.

46:10.191 --> 46:11.223
- Michael, hey, hey!
- No.

46:11.256 --> 46:13.593
- Gathering information on... on my kind!
- Michael!

46:13.626 --> 46:14.731
Michael!

46:14.764 --> 46:16.068
That's not why I was with you.

46:16.101 --> 46:17.406
I did care about you.

46:17.439 --> 46:19.008
Look at him!

46:19.041 --> 46:20.504
Michael, calm down!

46:20.544 --> 46:22.007
You don't have to believe me,

46:22.040 --> 46:24.082
but my feelings for you were real.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.419
Protecting the people of this city

46:25.452 --> 46:26.915
is more important to me than anything,

46:26.948 --> 46:29.355
and I'm sorry if you can't understand that.

46:36.031 --> 46:38.465
You kept Furiad's blade the entire time.

46:42.441 --> 46:46.473
What were you going to do, kill me with it?

46:46.514 --> 46:48.745
Michael, I...

46:48.778 --> 46:51.281
Michael!

46:51.314 --> 46:53.514
Michael, let her go.

46:53.554 --> 46:55.418
Hey! Michael!

46:55.451 --> 46:58.891
Let her go.

46:58.924 --> 47:01.724
Michael, put her down!

47:04.063 --> 47:06.399
I was protecting us.

47:08.533 --> 47:10.235
No!

47:12.908 --> 47:15.514
Michael, what have you done?

47:18.150 --> 47:19.717
There's Michael.

47:19.750 --> 47:21.747
He's killed the Senator!

47:24.022 --> 47:26.116
Michael, please!

47:26.156 --> 47:28.390
No! Michael, stop!

47:28.423 --> 47:29.866
Stop!

47:29.899 --> 47:32.732
Michael!

47:32.765 --> 47:37.834
Michael, that's enough.

47:37.875 --> 47:40.710
You've gone too far.

48:44.466 --> 48:46.663
Everything you've taught me.

48:46.696 --> 48:49.702
Everything you've taught me.

48:49.735 --> 48:51.798
Everything!

48:51.831 --> 48:54.165
And this is how it ends.

49:21.572 --> 49:25.339
To be fair, I did try to warn you.

49:25.372 --> 49:29.875
My brother's rage knows no bounds.

49:29.908 --> 49:32.713
You stay away from me.

49:32.746 --> 49:34.848
And you stay away from Claire.

49:34.882 --> 49:36.679
Claire.

49:36.712 --> 49:39.843
Is that all you're worried about?

49:39.884 --> 49:44.587
My acolytes are everywhere in Vega.

49:44.620 --> 49:46.482
The ivory towers,

49:46.524 --> 49:47.788
the nuclear plants,

49:47.821 --> 49:49.589
your military.

49:49.622 --> 49:53.091
I mean, how do you think
I walked out of my cell?

49:59.332 --> 50:01.931
Come on, Alex!

50:04.003 --> 50:06.538
Put your faith in me.

50:08.939 --> 50:11.712
Give me a chance to guide you.

50:11.745 --> 50:15.414
The only way we can end this
war and bring Father back

50:15.447 --> 50:17.446
is through your markings.

50:22.288 --> 50:24.392
It's never gonna happen.

50:24.425 --> 50:26.593
Yes, it will.

50:26.626 --> 50:29.190
Otherwise I'll burn this city

50:29.223 --> 50:30.756
and everyone in it to the ground.

50:30.789 --> 50:33.895
And I'll kill Noma, too.

50:33.928 --> 50:36.766
All that blood,

50:36.799 --> 50:39.100
all those lives,

50:39.133 --> 50:43.405
will fall on you.

50:43.438 --> 50:46.238
Choice is yours.

51:05.764 --> 51:09.204
I'm so sorry about Becca.

51:09.237 --> 51:13.075
It's horrible.

51:13.108 --> 51:17.510
The radar tracked Gabriel going east.

51:17.543 --> 51:19.645
We've lost him.

51:19.678 --> 51:20.783
He's gone.

51:20.815 --> 51:22.120
It's not your fault.

51:22.153 --> 51:24.391
I was so stupid thinking we could hold him,

51:24.424 --> 51:29.124
even if it was just for a few hours.

51:29.157 --> 51:31.388
My father wouldn't have hesitated.

51:31.429 --> 51:32.629
Hey.

51:32.662 --> 51:34.824
It's my fault too.

51:34.857 --> 51:38.389
I supported the decision to
have the execution delayed.

51:38.422 --> 51:41.195
It's okay.

51:41.228 --> 51:44.165
We'll get through this,

51:44.198 --> 51:45.270
as a family.

51:50.409 --> 51:52.970
You know?

51:53.003 --> 51:55.337
I overheard you and Alex,

51:55.370 --> 51:59.102
and I'm not going to stand here
and pretend it doesn't hurt.

51:59.143 --> 52:02.404
But I have a forgiving heart, Claire,

52:02.445 --> 52:06.147
especially for the ones I love.

52:06.180 --> 52:10.682
And I will proudly raise this
child as if it was my own.

52:10.715 --> 52:13.945
I'll protect it with my life.

52:13.986 --> 52:15.984
William...

52:18.491 --> 52:20.829
Probably silly to think
flowers would cheer you up

52:20.862 --> 52:22.229
in a moment like this,

52:22.262 --> 52:24.628
but I thought I'd give it a go.

52:24.661 --> 52:26.764
My favorite flowers.

52:31.340 --> 52:34.539
Well, at least they used to be.

52:34.573 --> 52:36.908
Desert sage.

52:41.548 --> 52:45.789
Why did you want to
delay Gabriel's execution?

52:45.822 --> 52:47.190
I didn't.

52:47.223 --> 52:49.190
I don't... What do you mean?

52:49.223 --> 52:50.926
For the same reason you did.

52:50.959 --> 52:53.160
The blindfold I found in your house,

52:53.193 --> 52:54.498
it was yours.

52:54.531 --> 52:58.171
Claire, you're not making sense.

52:58.204 --> 53:01.568
You know who made perfect sense today?

53:01.609 --> 53:04.672
Gabriel, when he told me
that you were an acolyte.

53:04.705 --> 53:08.077
Claire, you can't listen to Gabriel.

53:08.110 --> 53:09.310
He's a liar.

53:09.343 --> 53:11.048
He's just trying to get under your skin.

53:11.081 --> 53:12.282
How would you know that?

53:12.315 --> 53:13.385
You've never met him, right?

53:13.418 --> 53:14.921
No, of course not.

53:14.954 --> 53:17.623
I held your hand.

53:17.656 --> 53:20.959
I-I prayed with you.

53:20.992 --> 53:22.287
I trusted you.

53:22.328 --> 53:23.456
Claire, this is a misunderstanding.

53:23.497 --> 53:24.594
No, don't touch me.

53:24.627 --> 53:25.593
You're not making sense.

53:25.634 --> 53:26.593
Guards!

53:26.634 --> 53:28.097
- Claire.
- Don't touch me.

53:28.130 --> 53:29.234
You've got this wrong.

53:29.267 --> 53:30.669
Take him to the servant quarters,

53:30.710 --> 53:32.604
and do not breathe a
word of this to anyone.

53:32.637 --> 53:35.172
No, Claire, hear me out!

53:35.213 --> 53:37.948
- Just let me explain!
- Go.

53:37.981 --> 53:40.413
Bye, William.

53:44.087 --> 53:48.023
It's a father's worst nightmare.

53:48.056 --> 53:53.232
The public can't know the
Principate was an acolyte.

53:53.265 --> 53:57.071
Today, William was in the wrong place

53:57.104 --> 53:58.798
at the wrong time.

53:58.839 --> 54:02.005
He got in the way of Gabriel as he escaped.

54:02.038 --> 54:05.475
I don't want him made a hero in death.

54:05.508 --> 54:07.508
He was a coward.

54:11.549 --> 54:13.445
I'll handle the announcement,

54:13.485 --> 54:15.684
and the details.

54:20.754 --> 54:23.183
And I'll mourn him appropriately.

54:40.404 --> 54:42.971
You always knew how to
push brother's buttons.

54:43.004 --> 54:44.266
Just as I had predicted,

54:44.307 --> 54:46.937
he's fallen back into his old ways.

54:46.970 --> 54:49.537
Is the chosen one coming too?

54:49.577 --> 54:53.440
I'm cautiously optimistic
about his loyalty.

54:56.913 --> 54:58.649
How about yours?

55:00.354 --> 55:02.057
As promised.

55:04.885 --> 55:07.050
My sword is yours.

55:20.096 --> 55:22.897
In the absence of my son,

55:22.930 --> 55:25.233
Gabriel has asked me to lead

55:25.266 --> 55:28.969
this sacred congregation.

55:29.010 --> 55:33.945
Let us pray, all of us together.

55:33.978 --> 55:37.147
When we join with Gabriel...

55:37.180 --> 55:40.352
He will join with us.

55:40.385 --> 55:44.317
When we offer him solemn loyalty...

55:44.350 --> 55:47.316
He will save us.

55:47.356 --> 55:50.891
When we are broken...

55:50.924 --> 55:55.196
We are stronger in our broken places.

55:55.229 --> 55:57.566
When we are stronger...

55:57.599 --> 55:59.566
We are worthy.

55:59.599 --> 56:01.835
When we are worthy...

56:01.868 --> 56:05.177
We are safe.

56:05.210 --> 56:07.375
When we join with Gabriel...

56:07.408 --> 56:09.912
He joins with us.

56:09.945 --> 56:12.647
When we are stronger,

56:12.680 --> 56:14.846
we are worthy.

56:14.886 --> 56:19.786
When we are worthy, we are safe.

56:19.819 --> 56:24.123
When we join with
Gabriel, he joins with us.

56:24.156 --> 56:27.057
When we offer him solemn loyalty,

56:27.090 --> 56:28.760
he will save us.

56:50.179 --> 56:51.914
Alex.

56:51.947 --> 56:52.780
Gabriel's escaped.

56:52.813 --> 56:54.919
I'm hearing all kinds of
crazy rumors about Michael.

56:54.952 --> 56:56.817
What the hell happened?

56:56.858 --> 56:59.997
Ethan, I need to ask you a favor.

57:00.030 --> 57:01.598
I need you to give this to Claire.

57:04.565 --> 57:07.763
Come on, man, tell me what's going on.

57:07.804 --> 57:10.098
Someday I'll explain everything to you,

57:10.139 --> 57:13.573
but right now,

57:13.606 --> 57:16.141
I need you to promise
me you'll look after her.

57:23.951 --> 57:25.591
Thank you, brother.

57:29.327 --> 57:33.129
Can you at least tell
me where you're going?

57:33.170 --> 57:34.698
You know I can't.

58:11.501 --> 58:12.962
Dad?

58:13.003 --> 58:14.664
What are you doing?

58:18.635 --> 58:19.843
Where are we?

58:19.876 --> 58:23.583
Claire wants you executed as a traitor.

58:23.616 --> 58:24.950
Well, just give me a chance.
I just need to explain to her.

58:24.983 --> 58:26.446
She doesn't have any evidence.

58:26.487 --> 58:29.288
She doesn't need evidence.
She's Lady of the City.

58:29.321 --> 58:31.319
And you indicted yourself.

58:31.360 --> 58:33.085
Ahh.

58:33.126 --> 58:34.621
Just make it quick.

58:34.662 --> 58:36.189
You could have implicated me.

58:36.229 --> 58:38.858
You could have told
Claire that I was involved,

58:38.891 --> 58:42.395
but you didn't because you are loyal.

58:42.428 --> 58:46.533
You are strong.

58:46.574 --> 58:50.173
I may be broken, but I'm
not gonna shoot my own son.

59:02.546 --> 59:04.783
Food, water, supplies

59:04.816 --> 59:07.085
for two, maybe three days out here.

59:07.118 --> 59:11.954
Whatever you do,

59:11.987 --> 59:15.952
you can never come back to Vega.

59:26.358 --> 59:27.398
Go.

59:32.767 --> 59:34.902
Will I see you again?

01:00:06.068 --> 01:00:08.772
"My name is Alex Lannon.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:11.236
"I'm your father.

01:00:11.269 --> 01:00:14.811
"And these are the hardest
words I've ever written.

01:00:17.277 --> 01:00:20.881
"When I was a boy, I was
given a letter by my dad,

01:00:20.915 --> 01:00:24.955
"a note that took me years to understand.

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:29.463
"My hope here is that the message is clear.

01:00:29.496 --> 01:00:33.462
"Your father loved you and
never wanted to leave you.

01:00:33.495 --> 01:00:36.099
"It breaks my heart to say good-bye

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:39.501
"without ever meeting you.

01:00:39.534 --> 01:00:41.502
"It's what I had to do,

01:00:41.535 --> 01:00:43.405
"not just for you,

01:00:43.438 --> 01:00:45.405
"but for all of us.

01:00:45.438 --> 01:00:48.705
"I do this to give you what I never had,

01:00:48.738 --> 01:00:50.904
"a normal life, a family,

01:00:50.945 --> 01:00:53.041
"happiness.

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:56.278
"Things in short supply.

01:00:56.311 --> 01:00:57.843
"But if you're reading this,

01:00:57.876 --> 01:00:59.946
"then chances are everything I've done

01:00:59.979 --> 01:01:02.979
"will have been worth it.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.148
"I love you.

01:01:09.222 --> 01:01:11.986
"More than you'll ever know.

01:01:14.229 --> 01:01:17.261
Your father, Alex."
