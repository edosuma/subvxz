WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:03.904
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.971 --> 00:06.110
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.173 --> 00:08.949
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.818
These are their stories.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.626
KIM: So what did you do this week for fun?

00:15.682 --> 00:19.129
Did you know that the word "fun"
can be found in over 14 languages,

00:19.186 --> 00:20.995
and its meaning changes every time?

00:21.054 --> 00:23.694
I was thinking about good old American fun.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.632
What's fun for me isn't always fun for my dad.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.140
You mean like what we did Saturday?

00:30.964 --> 00:35.709
Robbie, I'm sure at the school you'll be able
to do more of the things you like to do.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.373
Here's your father.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.715
Kim? The stuff we talked about today,

00:42.776 --> 00:44.687
I'd like to be the one to tell him, okay?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.924
Sorry I'm late.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.152
How did it go?

00:51.218 --> 00:52.288
We had a good talk.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.456
Will you be there tomorrow?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.466
Probably not. Good luck.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.667
Thank you.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.269
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

01:04.397 --> 01:05.604
- Hello?
- WEBSTER: Hi, Kim.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.906
Oh, hi.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.877
Listen, I just got out of a press conference.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.347
Got a message Jim Hardy canceled tonight.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.180
So here I am with nobody to eat dinner with.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.151
What about your wife? Doesn't she eat?

01:15.275 --> 01:18.381
I thought you social workers were
morally ambivalent about marriage.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.890
KIM: Not this social worker.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.557
If you just want to talk about budget
cuts in my department, that'd be fine.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.687
Fair enough.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.958
I'll pick you up from work.
Watch the news tonight.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.795
They promised me 15 seconds.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.972
There are two kids aged four and six

01:34.027 --> 01:36.132
and two adults. Meth heads. Let's go.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.106
TIMMY: Dad! Where are they
taking us? What's happening?

01:38.165 --> 01:41.169
- JOAN: Oh, God!
- ADOLPH: Get your hands off of me! Timmy!

01:41.234 --> 01:43.339
JOAN: Please! They're my babies.
Please bring them back.

01:43.403 --> 01:44.507
- TIMMY: Dad?
- ADOLPH: Timmy!

01:44.571 --> 01:46.881
- You bitch! Give them back to me!
- Now, come on. Stand back.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.920
Timmy! Fight back, man!

01:48.976 --> 01:50.512
Bite her on the hand!

01:50.577 --> 01:53.183
You'll get them back when
you can take care of them.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.356
JOAN: (SOBBING) Mommy and Daddy love you!

01:57.317 --> 01:59.957
WEBSTER: (ON TV) Of course not.
It's one of the Mayor's pet projects.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.967
REPORTER: Will cutbacks mean more
potholes and bigger piles of garbage?

02:03.023 --> 02:05.697
WEBSTER: Next you're gonna ask me
when I stopped beating my wife.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.933
Look, it's up to the maintenance
crews and the sanitation workers.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.476
Everyone is gonna have to
work harder for less money.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.772
The Mayor is in conference
with his workers right now.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.643
We're planning on having a meeting very soon.

02:16.536 --> 02:19.073
I bet you've never seen the inside
of a Deputy Mayor's apartment.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.244
It's got a sterile efficiency
some women find irresistible.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.685
- Bill.
- Okay, okay.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.484
And just in case you weren't paying attention

02:24.544 --> 02:27.718
when I was talking about our budget
problems, I'll send you a memo.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.861
Don't worry, it's all in here.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.988
Oh, wait. If you won't sleep
with me, can you buy me a paper?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.563
Somebody might recognize me
if I get out of the car.

02:35.622 --> 02:38.432
I just want to see what they
have on the press conference.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.029
Let this be my farewell gift to you.

02:45.899 --> 02:46.969
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Red Sox are holding on

02:47.034 --> 02:49.708
(CELL PHONE RINGING) to a 2-0
lead over the Yankees...

02:49.770 --> 02:52.011
Hello. Hi, baby.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.150
I just got out of the restaurant.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.244
I'm saying goodbye to Jim Hardy.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.186
I'll call you right back. Bye.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.027
That wasn't so bad, was it?

03:03.083 --> 03:04.357
Mmm-hmm.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.553
(KIM SCREAMING)
Hey! Get away from her!

03:06.620 --> 03:08.566
Leave her alone! Help! Help!

03:08.622 --> 03:10.761

03:59.372 --> 04:02.615
What we got is everybody heard the
gunshot but nobody saw anything.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.849
Any idea what Webster was doing here?

04:04.911 --> 04:08.449
Mrs. Webster said she talked to him on his
cell phone just before he got killed.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.756
He told her he was just
finishing dinner with Jim Hardy

04:10.817 --> 04:11.989
from the Sanitation Workers Union.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.326
What does Mr. Hardy say?

04:13.386 --> 04:16.890
Well, he told us he canceled his
dinner with Mr. Webster that afternoon

04:16.957 --> 04:19.904
and spent the evening at home with Mrs. Hardy.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.409
Looks like Webster had a passenger,

04:27.467 --> 04:30.141
sat close to him, wore a
purple cashmere sweater.

04:30.203 --> 04:33.207
Tight-fitting size 2 with a plunging neckline.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.780
Hmm. That I can't tell from this.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.152
I can tell from the bull
he was feeding his wife.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.220
The window was rolled down.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.463
He was reaching over when he was shot.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.058
Maybe reaching for this.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.703
He had someone get him a paper?

05:02.702 --> 05:05.808
Maybe we can find partial
prints on the quarters.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.554
No quarters.

05:11.945 --> 05:12.980
None in here.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.650
Same story here.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.856
We must be in a low-readership neighborhood.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.505
Quarters.

05:34.634 --> 05:36.307
Two that got away.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.586
Hey! Hey! How you doing?

05:42.642 --> 05:46.215
Hey, let me give you a hand.
Ready. One, two, three, up!

05:46.813 --> 05:50.784
There they are. Look at that!
It's a gold mine!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.262
Let me give you a hand. Hey, you know what?

05:52.319 --> 05:55.562
I have two quarters that you missed
from the boxes on 12th Street.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.659
We're gonna owe the ledger some money.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.398
You were on 12th Street last night?

06:01.595 --> 06:02.665
Who said that?

06:02.729 --> 06:06.871
Oh, they're your boxes on 12th Street?
Your boxes, your quarters.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.246
Yeah.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.745
Did you see anybody buy
a paper from those boxes?

06:16.476 --> 06:20.151
Yeah. A woman in a... In a black car.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.691
She had a fuzzy sweater.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.389
We'll need you to help us
make a picture of this lady.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.399
You stay put. We'll get somebody
to take you to our office.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.127
Webster had a woman in the car with him.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.400
She bought him a newspaper and disappeared.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.999
We'll say she's a potential witness
and leave it at that. What else?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.135
Webster had enemies. City
workers, union leaders.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.180
We're checking everybody's
whereabouts last night.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.682
Anybody asks, we're treating
this as ordinary street crime.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.650
This is Webster's cell phone
records for yesterday.

06:47.707 --> 06:51.280
He called the Administration for
Child Services mid-afternoon.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.689
The witness might work in
the city's social services.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.494
Yes, hello. Beg your pardon?

07:00.153 --> 07:03.259
All right, her private
line. Is Ms. Stevens in?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.565
When?

07:08.762 --> 07:11.606
No, that's all right. Thank you very much.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.642
Found her.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.610
We ID'd her off her prints.
City has them on file.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.116
Manual strangulation.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.642
Mmm-hmm. But the ME thinks
she was knocked out first.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.023
Do you have her clothes?

07:34.621 --> 07:35.929
Cashmere.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.136
What year was Webster's car?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.264
'99.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.366
It's got a new car smell.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.601
Make sure you mention that to the lab.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.310
- Any purse?
- RICHLAND: No.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.678
She was found uptown?

07:52.405 --> 07:53.975
Wrapped in a blanket.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.453
In a shopping cart, under
the FDR at 136th Street.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.356
Rumor has it you have a suspect in custody.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.551
Yeah.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.755
It wasn't me, man. I'm just the wrong guy

08:03.817 --> 08:05.626
(KICKING TABLE)
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.131
EAMES: People saw you when she
took your kids. You were angry.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.464
You were angry when you went down to the ACS,

08:10.523 --> 08:12.935
angry when you jumped her outside
her apartment... No, no.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.371
...angry when you strangled her
and drove off with her body.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.908
Okay. You know what? Okay.
What difference does it make?

08:17.964 --> 08:20.843
You want to think I did it,
fine, go ahead, I don't care.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.402
What difference does it make?

08:22.469 --> 08:24.005
Adolph.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.818
When's the last time you had something to eat?

08:27.874 --> 08:29.547
I only eat candy.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.816
You want to tell us what you did last night?

08:35.881 --> 08:39.260
Well, me and Jeanie were upset

08:39.318 --> 08:40.821
'cause, you know, we miss the kids.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.292
So we scored,

08:43.590 --> 08:46.230
you know, and just chilled out watching TV.

08:47.627 --> 08:48.765
Here.

08:49.996 --> 08:53.273
It's easier when your
fingernails are not so short.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.879
Yeah.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.575
You usually keep your pinky nails long?

08:59.105 --> 09:01.085
Yeah.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.949
That's for your ears, right?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.546
I got this condition.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.623
Oily ears. it's like I got bugs in there.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.490
Well, why are your fingernails
cut so short now?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.722
The other guys did it.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.134
The other cops, they did it. They cut
it for... They said it's for evidence.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.407
I smell square one up ahead.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.108
Kulik's long pinky nails would've
left deep marks on the girl's neck

09:31.171 --> 09:32.275
if he'd strangled her.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.750
These marks were made by someone
with neat clipped nails.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.788
Somebody who knew Stevens
had a history with Kulik

09:36.843 --> 09:38.117
and tried to frame him.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.823
I'll go break the bad news
to the boys upstairs.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.416
GOREN: Now, there is good news.

09:42.482 --> 09:47.454
Since her body was moved, it shows that the
Deputy Mayor wasn't the primary target.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.539
EAMES: Any other parents threaten her?

09:55.595 --> 09:59.475
No. She had an excellent track
record of reuniting families.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.943
She has notations in here.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.174
"Subject looks forward
to intellectual challenges.

10:04.237 --> 10:07.878
"Emotional maturity beyond his years.
Sheltered home life.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.853
"Unsuited for college environment."

10:11.277 --> 10:14.156
It reads like evaluations
for college admissions.

10:14.581 --> 10:18.119
If she was doing anything like
that, it was on her own time.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.757
Any names to go with the notes?

10:20.820 --> 10:24.700
No, just serial numbers.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.133
"Subject interacts well
with college-age adults.

10:29.195 --> 10:32.404
"Subject has practical concerns. He worries...

10:34.534 --> 10:38.744
"He worries that he's too short
to use bathroom facilities."

10:40.874 --> 10:42.512
These subjects are little kids.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.055
Little kids being considered
for college admissions.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.690
Geniuses.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.561
There can't be that many places in town

10:51.618 --> 10:54.155
that give mortarboards to baby Einsteins.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.876
Robbie, I need to speak with
your father for a moment.

11:10.069 --> 11:13.073
I've just had some shocking
news about Ms. Stevens

11:13.139 --> 11:17.053
which has forced us to adjust our
normal admissions procedures.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.056
Based on Robbie's tests and everything,

11:20.113 --> 11:24.027
we would like to offer him a place
at the school. Congratulations.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.892
- You've been accepted.
- I have?

11:28.955 --> 11:31.265
You made it, Robbie. You did it.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.733
DR. LEONARD: Since our students
are much younger

11:39.799 --> 11:42.507
than the college kids they'll
be attending classes with,

11:42.569 --> 11:46.176
the university requires that we make
sure that they're emotionally equipped

11:46.239 --> 11:49.186
to handle the social and academic pressures.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.553
Why hire a city social worker
to do the evaluations?

11:52.612 --> 11:54.091
DR. LEONARD: Well, Kim volunteered.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.093
She was an alumnus of Metcalf University,

11:56.149 --> 11:58.789
with degrees in social work and psychology.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.922
How many children are up for admission?

12:00.987 --> 12:04.457
8, for 6 openings for the summer semester.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.738
Had Ms. Stevens turned in
her evaluation on them?

12:07.794 --> 12:11.742
No. She was going to on Thursday
when we made our final selection.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.711
Last Thursday, the day after she was killed.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.611
EAMES: How did you choose the winners
without Ms. Stevens' evaluations?

12:19.672 --> 12:24.212
DR. LEONARD: We relied solely on the
other criteria, IQ scores, SAT's.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.852
Please, you're going to disturb the children.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.951
Are they working on that
problem on the board?

12:30.016 --> 12:32.553
Yes. This is a special math tutorial.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.697
GOREN: Really? These little kids
are gonna solve that?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.667
These are profoundly gifted children.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.568
You'll have to forgive my
partner, Dr. Leonard.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.107
He's feeling very humble right now.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.503
The competition to get into
your program must be fierce.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.173
- I hope you're not suggesting that...
- We are.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.281
Of the 6 kids that you admitted,

12:54.340 --> 12:55.751
how many of them are on the bubble

12:55.808 --> 12:58.311
as far as Ms. Stevens'
evaluations are concerned?

12:58.945 --> 13:02.552
Well, as I told you, we never
got her final evaluations.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.761
But there was one student
I thought might've been,

13:08.087 --> 13:10.158
as you say, on the bubble.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.235
We thought Dr. Leonard's program would
help Charlie re-focus his goals.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.743
But it became apparent after a few days...

13:19.799 --> 13:22.905
That Charlie's goals didn't need re-focusing.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.849
Charlie doesn't have to be a math genius,
you know. He can be a musical prodigy.

13:26.906 --> 13:30.046
Not to mention, you think the math chicks
look anything like Jennifer Connelly?

13:30.643 --> 13:34.113
No way, hombre. Besides, the
hot babes go for musicians.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.991
You see the problem.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.551
Music is my life, Mom.

13:37.617 --> 13:41.190
Did Ms. Stevens give you any
hint that there might be a

13:41.287 --> 13:42.664
problem with your son?

13:42.722 --> 13:44.998
No. But we knew going in, it wouldn't be easy.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.937
I told Kim I just wanted off
that baby-genius track.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.998
Track. You make it sound like it's a race.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.141
Oh, it's totally cut-throat at our level.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.237
We all know we'll all be competing for
the prizes and the research money.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.674
Do you know any of the other students
that applied to Dr. Leonard's program?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.117
Oh, sure. Except for the new guy,

14:02.175 --> 14:05.452
we've all been together in math camps
since we came out of the test tube.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.755
Charlie knows very well he
wasn't conceived in a test tube.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.889
So who was this new kid?

14:17.156 --> 14:19.329
Robbie something. I don't know.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.201
Leonard treats him like
he's another John Nash.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.830
She just leaves him alone and lets him doodle.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.705
His father told me he's been
home-schooled since kindergarten.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.506
Do you know the other parents well?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.707
Pretty well. We spend a
lot of time commiserating.

14:30.770 --> 14:36.015
You have no idea what a challenge
it is parenting a gifted child.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.721
This math equation.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.792
I saw it at the Institute on the board.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.654
Oh, yeah. It's the Riemann Hypothesis.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.197
One of the Millennium Projects.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.096
You solve it, you make a million bucks.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.661
Leonard's pet project.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.830
She wants one of her
baby geniuses to solve it.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.268
Can I keep this?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.668
Sure. What do I need it for?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.542
(STRUMMING SINGLE NOTE)

15:04.036 --> 15:06.038
DAVID: Oh, he went to school
for about five minutes

15:06.105 --> 15:07.846
until I saw what was happening to him.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.977
Which was what?

15:09.041 --> 15:11.385
He was bored, he was so far ahead,

15:11.444 --> 15:14.721
and I thought, hell, I can do a
better job than those klunkheads.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.192
Klunkheads.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.462
You think they were klunkheads, Robbie?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.431
Well, they were just trying their best.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.367
But they didn't have enough
training to teach someone like me.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.066
Who helped you home-school him? Your wife?

15:28.694 --> 15:31.004
My wife died in an accident five years ago.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.339
I came up with the curriculum.
It was just Robbie and me.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.743
EAMES: And you what, work nights?

15:35.802 --> 15:40.012
No. I spend my nights with Robbie.
I'm on disability from work.

15:40.072 --> 15:43.076
Tae kwon do? You used to compete?

15:43.142 --> 15:44.280
A long time ago.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.688
But unless I was willing to do it on a
national level, it wasn't worth it.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.920
Auto racing, did you do that nationally?

15:49.982 --> 15:51.325
Regional, quarter mile.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.388
Robbie remembers being in his
mother's arms watching me race.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.402
Let me guess, you were in a band.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.738
Oh, that's all in the past.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.433
Robbie, you want to show me your room?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.407
- Now I devote myself full-time to
my son's education.
- Is that okay?

16:10.036 --> 16:12.949
Wednesday night, you remember where you were?

16:13.005 --> 16:15.076
Here. Robbie was asleep.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.049
- Do you own a car?
- No.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.581
Gun?

16:20.213 --> 16:21.487
Come on.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.659
No, I don't own a gun.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.697
Derek Jeter's rookie card, signed.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.133
You must be a Yankee fan.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.398
Yeah, baseball's a thinking man's game.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.498
Do you know who managed
the Yankees in the '80s?

16:36.562 --> 16:38.940
Who didn't manage the Yankees in the '80s?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.636
Billy Martin came back three times,

16:40.700 --> 16:45.046
Gene Michael came back twice, Bob Lemon,
Yogi Berra, Clyde King, Lou Piniella,

16:45.104 --> 16:47.744
Dallas Green, Bucky Dent and Stump Merrill.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.911
Wow.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.980
Your dad take you to the games?

16:52.044 --> 16:55.890
No. He says watching sports doesn't
add any value to my education.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.552
But I follow the stats on my computer.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.054
But you play.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.090
What position?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.830
Oh, no. I don't have time.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.638
How were your interviews with Kim Stevens?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.736
Oh, she was a nice person.

17:16.402 --> 17:19.473
Did she tell you that you might
not get into the program?

17:20.071 --> 17:21.210
No.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.617
The Riemann Hypothesis.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.791
You know what? This does not look fun.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.062
My dad says that sometimes
the way to solve a problem

17:33.119 --> 17:36.100
is to let your right brain work on it.
So that's what I'm doing.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.639
I really like your drawings.

17:44.730 --> 17:49.270
Hey, if you don't need them,
you think I can have them?

17:49.502 --> 17:50.606
Sure. Okay.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.174
Catcher, that's what you play.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.080
How did you know?

17:57.043 --> 17:58.454
It's the thinking man's position.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.096
You really need a million bucks that bad?

18:44.724 --> 18:46.863
It's Robbie's calculations.

18:48.294 --> 18:52.265
They contain symbols that
aren't in the other kids' work,

18:52.331 --> 18:56.006
and they're not in any work
done on the Riemann Hypothesis.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.176
They don't belong there.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.944
Well, he's 10 years old. He made a mistake.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.917
No. There's no mistake.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.954
This symbol. Infinity.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.789
This one.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.389
It's Omega. The end. This one.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.725
Theta. Death.

19:22.128 --> 19:26.076
Now Robbie wrote these in his
calculations over and over again.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.810
Infinity. The end. Death.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.444
He's suicidal.

19:34.206 --> 19:38.382
Kim Stevens found out. She was
going to keep him out of the program.

19:44.450 --> 19:49.024
If Kim Stevens decided Robbie
Was psychologically unfit, his
father might've found out.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.761
Maybe he thought he could change her mind.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.326
Webster got into the
picture. The dad panicked.

19:53.392 --> 19:57.204
And killed two people just to get his
child into an educational program?

19:57.263 --> 19:59.539
Dads kill over hockey. Why not over education?

19:59.598 --> 20:00.804
Yes. Especially this dad.

20:00.866 --> 20:05.611
The rock star, martial arts
expert, drag racing champion.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.819
All attention-seeking careers,
all of which he's failed at.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.186
But if his son succeeds,
the spotlight's back on him.

20:13.245 --> 20:17.591
Have you confirmed that Ms. Stevens
diagnosed Robbie Bishop as unfit?

20:18.050 --> 20:22.157
The school won't release her files
without the father's permission.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.062
Fat chance of that.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.801
Unless we could have him removed
as guardian of his son's records.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.702
We'd have to convince a judge

20:29.762 --> 20:33.767
there's probable cause to consider
Mr. Bishop a murder suspect.

20:38.904 --> 20:43.785
The lab found a mixture of higher paraffins
imprinted on the back of her sweater.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.986
The substance is a preservative, Cosmoline,

20:48.047 --> 20:50.823
used on new cars shipped from overseas.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.124
It's shaped like a flashing
around a car window.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.926
Bishop pushed her up against his car.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.627
Bishop doesn't have a car. We checked.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.364
Do we have Bishop's employment history?

21:06.732 --> 21:08.609
He worked in the Stevedores Union.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.580
Worked for Autotrain Freight Forwarders.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.981
Still works there a couple of days a month.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.178
Taking cars off boats, putting them on trains.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.487
Wouldn't be too tough to borrow
one of those cars for the night.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.422
You match the imprint on the sweater

21:21.480 --> 21:24.017
to a model of car in that shipyard,

21:24.083 --> 21:26.825
that should be enough probable
cause to satisfy a judge.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.793
Enough for a search warrant, too?

21:32.091 --> 21:34.162
I want everything cataloged
and returned, you understand?

21:34.226 --> 21:36.263
You got some balls coming
between me and my son.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.399
I'm the only one here who's got
his best interest at heart.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.206
You're not concerned that
your son might be suicidal?

21:41.267 --> 21:43.770
If Robbie was unhappy, he'd tell me.

21:44.403 --> 21:47.077
You couldn't tell from all
these personality tests?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.551
Those just measure social adjustment.

21:49.608 --> 21:52.248
I have to make sure he's
not getting overloaded.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.383
I've always read that kids with
high IQ's, they thrive on pressure.

21:55.447 --> 21:58.087
They need it to help them develop.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.855
There's nothing I hate more than
discussing my child with a know-it-all.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.292
Hmm. Are you dyslexic?

22:07.059 --> 22:09.061
'Cause you wrote down a phone
number, then crossed it out

22:09.128 --> 22:11.267
and then re-wrote it in the right order.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.310
I was tired, that's all.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.404
Where's your partner? Where'd she go?

22:17.837 --> 22:21.307
My mom used to tell me stories
at night before I went to sleep.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.353
Now your dad reads to you.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.446
Yes, until I fall asleep.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.247
He never leaves me alone.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.852
What about last Wednesday? Did he read to you?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.657
I just went to sleep. I was pooped.

22:35.754 --> 22:39.861
Robbie, the detectives have work to do.
Let's get out of their way.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.311
Look what he showed me.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.443
His aunt and uncle.

22:52.504 --> 22:56.452
They live in western Mass. He says
he visits every chance he gets.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.419
There he looks happy.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.890
If he was there. You see Robbie's face?

23:04.550 --> 23:08.054
The lighting and the shadows
don't match the others.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.830
He digitally put himself in this photo.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.271
Looks like Stevens did a pretty
thorough work-up on Robbie.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.873
At least he had fun with her,
she took him to the Bronx Zoo,

23:26.939 --> 23:29.112
to Little League in
Prospect Park one Saturday.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.518
Yeah. To observe him with kids his own age.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.955
She says here he's remarkably well-adjusted.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.857
How could she miss this kid was miserable?

23:36.949 --> 23:40.556
Says here she gave him an MMPI.
Do you have it over there?

23:40.619 --> 23:43.998
Well, if you tell me what it is in plain
English, I might be able to find it.

23:44.056 --> 23:49.233
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.
It tests social adjustment.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.805
I remember this. We had to take
it the last year of high school.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.410
So did we.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.839
How did you do?

23:57.903 --> 23:59.644
I had to go to my counselor's office

23:59.705 --> 24:01.707
and have a talk with the school shrink.

24:02.574 --> 24:03.609
How about you?

24:03.676 --> 24:06.919
Me? I was so well adjusted,
they elected me prom queen.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.892
Well, Robbie's scores are off the chart,

24:13.352 --> 24:16.595
indicating a high level of
adaptability and socialization.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.132
Not the kid we saw.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.468
His dad must have coached him.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.170
He had all the personality
tests, the literature.

24:27.232 --> 24:28.711
Wasn't taking any chances.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.509
Well, it worked. She was
recommending him for admission.

24:38.544 --> 24:42.117
Then why would David Bishop
get the idea that she wasn't?

24:44.650 --> 24:48.689
I have no idea how Mr. Bishop
could've gotten that impression.

24:48.754 --> 24:53.533
I was never anything but absolutely positive
about Robbie's joining our program.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.865
I wanted him.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.463
You told Mr. Bishop that?

24:56.528 --> 24:58.269
That would've been impolitic.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.469
I had to wait for Kim's evaluation.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.780
I mean, what do those
evaluations tell you, anyway?

25:03.836 --> 25:06.646
These kids are bound to be maladjusted.

25:06.705 --> 25:10.949
They've never fit in anywhere.
But here, they're with their own kind.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.922
You've created a safe haven for them.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.992
I'd like to think so.

25:16.482 --> 25:20.658
And if Robbie acts out, I mean, it's
nothing you're gonna take too seriously.

25:20.719 --> 25:24.223
That's right. It was just a normal
reaction to his special circumstances.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.962
So he acted out, then.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.436
That's not what I said.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.871
You said his acting out was normal.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.370
What did he do

25:35.367 --> 25:37.711
that you didn't take seriously?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.948
When he came for his first interview
in my office, he fainted.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.582
His father said he had the flu.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.281
EAMES: What did you think it was?

25:46.345 --> 25:48.052
Stress, obviously.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.627
This was the most important
interview of his young life.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.289
Why wasn't this incident in Ms. Stevens' file?

25:54.353 --> 25:55.991
Because I didn't tell her.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.558
It was immaterial to his suitability.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.827
Uh, you have classes seven days a week?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.204
The children only attend six days.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.634
Saturdays for some, Sundays for others,

26:06.698 --> 26:08.644
depending upon their religious persuasion.

26:08.700 --> 26:09.974
Saturdays for Robbie?

26:10.035 --> 26:11.708
Yes.

26:12.838 --> 26:15.011
Did he know he'd have to
go to school on Saturdays?

26:15.507 --> 26:16.918
Absolutely.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.148
We make it clear when the children apply

26:19.211 --> 26:21.350
the level of commitment
that we expect from them.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.222
Would you like to go
to a Little League game?

26:24.983 --> 26:28.123
I talked to Dr. Leonard. She
doesn't think you're giving 100%.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.461
But I'm doing the best I can.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.468
Nothing is more important than your
education. You know that, right?

26:32.524 --> 26:33.525
I know.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.866
I might not always be there to remind you.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.167
Where are you going?

26:36.228 --> 26:39.903
Nowhere. All I'm saying is I
want you to concentrate harder.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.040
You have your lunch?

26:42.101 --> 26:43.808
All right. See you at 4:00.

26:50.209 --> 26:54.123
I remember this kid from the tryout.
He knew a lot about baseball.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.624
Did he show up by himself?

26:55.681 --> 26:58.457
No. His mother was there, in the stands.

26:58.517 --> 27:01.361
I remember. He pointed her out to me.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.594
Yeah, that's her.

27:04.590 --> 27:08.504
These kids, they know that their games
and practices are on Saturdays, right?

27:08.560 --> 27:11.097
Yeah. We tell them at the tryout.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.137
Thanks.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.978
He knew if he got accepted
into Leonard's program,

27:16.034 --> 27:17.570
he wouldn't be able to make the games.

27:17.636 --> 27:21.311
But he signed up anyway, five days
before Leonard made her picks.

27:21.373 --> 27:24.616
Robbie must've been convinced
he wouldn't be admitted.

27:24.676 --> 27:28.590
Or else he was making sure he
wouldn't be by lying to his father.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.924
Telling him that Kim Stevens was
giving him a negative evaluation.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.793
Hoping like any normal 10-year-old

27:33.852 --> 27:36.594
his dad would then just
forget about the school.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.501
Not realizing that his dad is not
like any normal 40-year-old.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.605
If he really didn't wanna be in this
program, why not just tell his father?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.145
Oh, and risk disappointing the
only parent that he has left?

27:49.201 --> 27:52.080
It's much safer for him to lay
the blame on Kim Stevens.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.083
Her notes suggest they
had a good relationship.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.982
Couldn't he have confided in her?

27:56.041 --> 27:58.214
Well, maybe he tried to
tell her in his own way.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.382
The Greek symbols in his math equations.

28:00.445 --> 28:03.426
Anything more overt might have put
him in direct conflict with his dad.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.156
When no one picked up on how
depressed this poor kid was,

28:06.218 --> 28:07.993
lying was his only way out.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.031
Now you need the truth from
him, what he told his father,

28:13.091 --> 28:16.868
what he knows about his father's
whereabouts the night of the killings,

28:16.929 --> 28:19.273
assuming you can talk to the
boy without his father.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.743
The only place Robbie's away from
his dad is at the university.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.110
We'd need Leonard's permission
to talk to him there.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.710
I imagine I could persuade her.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.114
You want to subject a minor
child to a police interrogation

28:31.176 --> 28:34.157
without his father being
present or even notified?

28:34.213 --> 28:37.160
It wouldn't be an interrogation.
He's a witness, not a suspect.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.889
I could be sued for allowing it!

28:38.951 --> 28:41.454
You could be charged if you don't.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.456
That is ridiculous.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.935
If I thought that there was abuse,
I would do something about it.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.939
Even if it meant losing Robbie
Bishop as one of your students?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.133
- Of course.
- Yeah.

28:51.196 --> 28:52.504
A profoundly gifted child

28:52.564 --> 28:54.942
who graduated high school at age seven?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.573
Who scored a perfect 800 on his math SAT's?

28:59.271 --> 29:03.378
Whose IQ was recorded at 246
on the Stanford-Binet scale?

29:04.209 --> 29:07.520
Who represents your only
chance of one of your students

29:07.579 --> 29:10.059
solving a Millennium Prize problem?

29:10.716 --> 29:14.061
You would risk losing him
over a little fainting spell?

29:14.119 --> 29:17.032
I should mention that while I
investigate this abuse charge,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.399
I can shut down your institute.

29:19.558 --> 29:23.768
Which, I'm sure, will generate a great
deal of interest from the press.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.545
Hey, Dad, I'm ready for school.

29:33.071 --> 29:37.281
Good, great. Let me just finish my
coffee. Your lunch is right there.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.259
ROBBIE: Colorado?

29:47.386 --> 29:49.388
We're going to Colorado?

29:51.123 --> 29:53.125
There's a special school.

29:53.558 --> 29:56.004
They heard about you. I don't know.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.168
There was something else in the mail.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.312
From the Little League.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.281
It's okay, Robbie. You're allowed
a mistake every now and then.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.005
Hey, Robbie.

30:33.131 --> 30:37.238
Dr. Leonard told me this is where
you like to spend your lunch hour.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.083
What are you doing up here?

30:40.806 --> 30:42.114
Nothing.

30:42.741 --> 30:45.381
I... I just wanna talk to you.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.323
I don't wanna talk about my dad.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.820
We don't have to.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.393
We could talk about this.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.056
I was wondering what you
thought of Boston this year.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.362
Boston?

30:59.891 --> 31:02.531
What, you don't like Boston?
They're leading the league.

31:02.594 --> 31:05.598
This week. They choke
every time they get a lead.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.774
They didn't choke the last
time they played the Yankees.

31:08.834 --> 31:11.405
Four-zip. Thanks to Jeter, he lost that game.

31:11.503 --> 31:12.607
Jeter was safe at second.

31:12.671 --> 31:16.209
With the bases loaded, they could've tied
the game and gone into extra innings.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.914
No way! Look, I... Look, I
saw that play on the news.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.081
He was out by a mile.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.751
I saw it happen. He was safe.

31:26.151 --> 31:29.997
Why, you... You watched the game?
Your dad was out that night?

31:32.023 --> 31:33.696
No, he was home.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.569
Well, you said

31:39.664 --> 31:43.476
that your dad doesn't let you watch baseball.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.242
Sometimes he does.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.941
No added value.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.848
That's... That's what you said.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.322
Come on, Robbie, tell me the
truth. Was your dad home?

31:54.846 --> 31:56.018
No.

31:57.716 --> 31:58.786
Oh.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.124
That was Wednesday night.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.438
I think the night before you found
out you were admitted here?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.077
You didn't think you were
gonna get in, did you?

32:30.582 --> 32:34.997
You thought that you were gonna
be playing baseball on Saturdays,

32:35.654 --> 32:37.930
instead of being stuck in here.

32:39.925 --> 32:44.305
Look, I know that you
tried to let people know

32:45.230 --> 32:47.471
how you felt about coming here.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.278
They wouldn't see it.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.023
You told your dad a fib?

33:01.847 --> 33:03.918
About Ms. Stevens

33:05.951 --> 33:08.227
keeping you out of the program?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.133
You hate it in here.

33:17.195 --> 33:19.038
You know how I know?

33:35.113 --> 33:36.524
You told me.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.452
Yeah.

33:49.961 --> 33:53.101
You've been thinking about these things a lot.

34:00.605 --> 34:03.347
Maybe you thought about hurting yourself.

34:09.781 --> 34:13.228
What is it about this place
that makes you so unhappy?

34:20.859 --> 34:22.702
Is it the other kids?

34:26.130 --> 34:27.632
The teachers?

34:35.806 --> 34:36.911
Is it the work?

34:42.347 --> 34:44.121
The work is too hard?

34:50.487 --> 34:52.297
Can I see your book?

34:55.460 --> 34:56.734
Please?

35:18.383 --> 35:20.363
Has Dr. Leonard seen this?

35:21.519 --> 35:22.623
No.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.666
(SNIFFLING)

35:26.625 --> 35:28.400
- Has your dad?
- No.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.206
Nobody knows?

35:44.943 --> 35:47.014
I just have to try harder.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.259
(ROBBIE WEEPING SOFTLY)

36:07.999 --> 36:09.706
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

36:18.109 --> 36:19.850
You again. What is it now?

36:20.278 --> 36:21.916
Now we're here for you.

36:23.048 --> 36:25.528
I have to pick up my son
from school in an hour.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.120
GOREN: We already have that covered.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.100
You going somewhere? Colorado, maybe?

36:33.158 --> 36:34.603
I don't have to answer that.

36:34.659 --> 36:38.835
Guess what? Wherever it is you're
going, our squad room's on the way.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.001
I hope you're not gonna keep
me away from Robbie too long.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.206
He's still adjusting to being
away from home every day.

36:44.469 --> 36:45.709
Robbie will be fine.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.272
He's a remarkable kid.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.776
I know that.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.582
Who first noticed he was
unique, you or your wife?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.685
My wife told me she thought he was bright.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.989
But it was your idea to test him?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.462
Yes.

37:01.519 --> 37:02.998
After she passed away?

37:03.455 --> 37:06.402
I owed it to her to help him
live up to his potential.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.766
He tested well.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.669
He maxed out the scale.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.763
The Stanford-Binet IQ scale.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.970
Right. And the Wechsler Scale.
He did that one when he was six.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.809
And then he got that perfect
score on his math SAT's.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.509
That must've been pretty gratifying for you.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.520
Because you were something of a
math whiz yourself in high school.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.524
Where did you hear that?

37:28.580 --> 37:32.426
GOREN: Just from your old report cards.
They were among the papers that we took.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.555
I did okay in high school.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.232
You expect more from yourself than just okay.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.432
I mean, if it weren't for the dyslexia,

37:42.494 --> 37:44.405
you would've been an "A" student.

37:44.462 --> 37:47.443
Twenty-five years ago, they didn't
know much about learning disabilities.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.008
But you have the drive to succeed,

37:50.068 --> 37:53.982
and you found other ways to be recognized.

37:54.172 --> 37:57.119
Like being a race car driver or a rock star.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.646
Or the father of a genius.

38:01.346 --> 38:03.553
And that's where you put your best efforts.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.891
Why not? I mean, that's what
being a father is all about,

38:05.950 --> 38:07.725
making sure your kid gets the best.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.424
GOREN: Paid off.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.827
David, we talked to Dr. Leonard today.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.865
And she thinks that he's done it.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.600
Done what?

38:19.664 --> 38:21.507
The Riemann Hypothesis.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.907
He's made a breakthrough and solved it.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.842
What? Oh, my God, that's...

38:28.907 --> 38:32.480
That's fantastic! I never dreamed
that he'd be able to do it.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.421
All our work, it was worth it!

38:35.380 --> 38:37.724
Here. Have a look at his workbook.

38:50.461 --> 38:53.465
What is this? This doesn't make sense.

38:53.531 --> 38:54.805
EAMES: You sure?

38:54.866 --> 38:58.075
Yeah, I'm sure. I know enough
about math to know this is...

38:58.136 --> 39:00.082
GOREN: What, gibberish?

39:03.541 --> 39:06.021
The work of a bright eighth grader

39:06.377 --> 39:09.586
wrestling with concepts
beyond his comprehension?

39:11.482 --> 39:12.688
My son didn't do this.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.354
GOREN: Yes, he did.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.495
This is what he does

39:17.856 --> 39:21.065
when you're not around. When
you're not there to help him.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.665
No, no, not my kid.

39:23.728 --> 39:27.005
You're not there to finish
the Wechsler IQ test for him

39:27.065 --> 39:30.706
and work out the answers for the SAT's...

39:30.768 --> 39:32.179
Robbie did those by himself.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.683
The only one he did by himself
is the Stanford-Binet

39:34.739 --> 39:37.913
and that's only after he memorized
the manual you gave to him

39:37.976 --> 39:39.717
before taking the test.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.753
David, Robbie told us

39:44.816 --> 39:48.491
about the memory exercises,
about the vocabulary builders,

39:48.553 --> 39:50.726
about the constant coaching.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.234
That's just how we work together.

39:55.727 --> 39:56.933
He's just a little boy.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.433
Yeah. A smart little boy
with a terrific memory

40:00.498 --> 40:03.877
and an overwhelming fear
of disappointing his father.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.055
But he's not a genius.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.886
But you're wrong.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.933
He's afraid to tell you.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.906
That's why he lied to you
about Kim Stevens' intentions.

40:31.963 --> 40:37.003
These are her notes on Robbie. She
was giving him a positive evaluation.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.126
Oh, God.

40:56.754 --> 40:57.994
Robbie.

40:58.923 --> 41:00.231
I need to see my son.

41:02.093 --> 41:06.872
I need to see my son. I need
to tell him... Robbie! Robbie!

41:06.931 --> 41:08.808
I want to talk to him. Robbie.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.515
He needs me.

41:13.705 --> 41:17.551
He's fine. His aunt and uncle are on
their way down from Massachusetts.

41:17.608 --> 41:19.087
You want to help your son?

41:19.644 --> 41:22.215
I want to talk to him. Robbie...

41:23.081 --> 41:25.960
You have to own up to the
murders. Tell the truth.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.626
Why?

41:32.824 --> 41:35.100
You confess, there's no trial.

41:37.362 --> 41:40.070
There's no need for us to bring
in Robbie to testify that...

41:40.131 --> 41:42.133
That you weren't home that night.

41:47.271 --> 41:50.377
There's no need for him to know
that the lie that he told you

41:50.441 --> 41:53.388
is the reason why you killed Kim Stevens.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.598
You can spare him that knowledge.

42:12.597 --> 42:13.735
Okay.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.138
Okay.

42:27.111 --> 42:30.923
Murder two, two counts, concurrent
sentences. 20-to-life.

42:32.283 --> 42:34.092
The worst thing for him?

42:34.152 --> 42:36.792
He'll miss Robbie's college graduation.

42:37.305 --> 42:43.420
