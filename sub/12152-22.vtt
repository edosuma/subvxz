You never had a childhood or

My whole life's been built on them.

It's true, Wes. It's her.

She's still dead.

Please. Angelus drank from me,

But like with most men,
it was a one-way street.

01:58.813 --> 02:00.849
I was dead already.

02:01.013 --> 02:06.292
Besides, my Wesley made sure
I'd be spared, just in case.

Always read the fine print.

- No game.

I don't think you'll want it,
but you'll take it.

- No?

Look, if we'd wanted to harm you,
we'd have blown up the limo, right?

15:08.813 --> 15:14.126
If you'd prefer to be armed during
your stay here, we'd have no objections.

15:15.333 --> 15:16.925
Just because we tried to kill...

15:17.093 --> 15:20.449
...or corrupt each and every one of you
at one time or another...

15:20.613 --> 15:22.251
...doesn't mean we can't be trusted.

15:22.493 --> 15:25.963
She's right.
We've made deals with them before.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.569
They are honorable, in their way.
I doubt we'll be in any danger.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.724
She was right about the limo.

15:32.373 --> 15:33.647
Do I get her?

15:36.893 --> 15:38.849
I think we'll be okay.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.211
Lorne, Preston will show you around
our entertainment division.

15:42.373 --> 15:45.888
Hi. Big fan. Huge.
Love your work.

15:46.053 --> 15:49.204
I had this prepared. Confidential list.
Peepers only.

15:49.373 --> 15:52.046
Thought you might want to
take a gander at our roster.

15:52.213 --> 15:54.773
Just a rundown of some
of the talent we represent here.

15:54.933 --> 15:59.370
I don't think you have to tell me
what you represent here, young man.

15:59.533 --> 16:03.970
I know. Evil.
Pure evil and the...

16:05.893 --> 16:09.363
Which is also apparently everyone
I've always wanted to meet.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.807
Follow me.

16:12.853 --> 16:16.084
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
Rutherford Sirk.

16:16.253 --> 16:18.483
I think you'll find you two
have a lot in common.

16:18.653 --> 16:20.962
It's a pleasure.
Shall we?

16:26.213 --> 16:27.532
Charles Gunn...

16:27.693 --> 16:29.411
...Lacey Shepherd.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.770
I think you'll find you two
have nothing in common.

16:32.933 --> 16:35.845
- This way, Chuck.
- Are you gonna try to corrupt me?

16:36.013 --> 16:38.322
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- We'll have to work on that.

16:38.493 --> 16:40.370
Knox, Fred Burkle.

16:40.693 --> 16:42.046
Hi.

16:42.693 --> 16:45.161
Knox is the star
of our science division.

16:47.493 --> 16:49.563
- Nice to meet you.
KNOX: You too.

16:50.213 --> 16:52.329
Well, this should be...

16:52.493 --> 16:53.812
...fun.

16:54.453 --> 16:55.932
Yeah.

17:01.093 --> 17:02.685
Well...

17:03.453 --> 17:07.731
...what do you know.
- Yep. Just you and me, boss.

17:08.133 --> 17:09.486
Come on, Charlie.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.849
Let me show you around
the Chocolate Factory.

17:15.853 --> 17:17.172
GUNN:
<i>Pretty slick.</i>

17:17.333 --> 17:18.732
- What is?
- You know...

17:18.893 --> 17:20.848
...giving each of us
our own little tour.

17:21.012 --> 17:24.403
- It's a good way to isolate Angel.
- Is that what we're doing?

17:24.573 --> 17:27.040
Be a big coup, bringing Angel
over to the dark side.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.010
Vampire with a soul. Champion.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.164
It's gonna look good
on anyone's letterhead.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.883
LACEY: Why do you assume Angel
is our priority?

17:34.053 --> 17:37.523
GUNN: You telling me he isn't?
LACEY: A priority.

17:37.693 --> 17:40.685
Though you each possess
gifts we feel would be useful.

17:40.853 --> 17:43.242
Well, I see what the others got.

17:43.413 --> 17:46.564
Fred's big brain. Wes' training.
Lorne's mind-reading thing.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.851
Guess I just don't know what
you guys expect me to do around...

17:51.013 --> 17:52.287
...here.

17:52.813 --> 17:55.122
Though I think maybe
I'm starting to figure it out.

17:55.293 --> 17:57.488
Bet I'd look real smart
in one of them blazers.

17:57.653 --> 17:59.245
Oh, I'm sure you would.

17:59.413 --> 18:02.530
But we have much grander plans
for you, Mr. Gunn.

18:02.693 --> 18:04.968
You do? Grander?

18:06.013 --> 18:07.332
Let's go upstairs.

18:07.493 --> 18:09.529
FRED:
So are you a lawyer?

18:09.693 --> 18:11.968
You don't look like a lawyer.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.522
No, I'm strictly R & D.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.366
Although, occasionally
some D & D.

18:18.173 --> 18:20.607
D & D. Dungeons and...

18:21.453 --> 18:25.207
We actually have a dungeon.
I can show it to you later if...

18:25.693 --> 18:28.048
I manage the science division.

18:28.453 --> 18:30.921
Seem young to be a head
of a whole science division.

18:31.093 --> 18:34.881
Oh, I'm not the head, I just manage it
for the department head...

18:35.053 --> 18:38.125
...which I guess, you know,
would be you.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.365
- Wow.
- I know.

18:51.733 --> 18:54.884
Everything modern technology
has to offer, at your fingertips.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.005
Everything state-of-the-art,
cutting edge.

18:58.173 --> 19:00.050
That's one of my creations.

19:00.653 --> 19:02.883
You might want to get out
of the lab more.

19:03.053 --> 19:05.567
Personal organizers
have been around for a while.

19:05.733 --> 19:09.521
I mean, not that it's not
a nice PalmPilot.

19:09.693 --> 19:11.445
I'll bet your buddy Matthew Partney...

19:11.613 --> 19:15.083
...at 6200 Crestwood Boulevard
in Lubbock, Texas would agree.

19:15.253 --> 19:17.369
Hey, how'd you know about Matt?

19:17.533 --> 19:20.252
Hacks into any electronic device
within a hundred yards.

19:20.413 --> 19:23.564
I patched into your cell phone's
address book.

19:23.853 --> 19:27.323
You're like the MacGyver
of Wolfram and Hart.

19:27.493 --> 19:28.926
You're not wrong.

19:29.093 --> 19:31.561
I can make practically anything out of...

19:31.813 --> 19:36.841
...a fully equipped,
multi-million-dollar lab.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.291
Our ancient prophecies wing.

19:47.413 --> 19:51.088
- Looks as if your wing's been clipped.
- Appearances can be deceiving.

19:51.373 --> 19:53.648
It's actually the most
comprehensive collection...

19:53.813 --> 19:56.373
...of prophesy archives
to be found anywhere.

19:56.733 --> 20:00.612
Choose something to read. Go on,
anything at all. Something rare.

20:02.253 --> 20:03.925
All right.

20:04.093 --> 20:05.924
The <i>Devandire Sibylline Codex</i>.

20:06.453 --> 20:08.648
Translated or Sanskrit?

20:09.533 --> 20:12.764
- Surprise me.
- I'm sure I will.

20:16.133 --> 20:19.284
<i>Devandire Codex</i>, Sanskrit.

20:28.013 --> 20:30.481
The template you're holding
provides access...

20:30.653 --> 20:33.167
...to anything stored
in the firm's locked archives...

20:33.333 --> 20:35.893
...relating to prophesies, omens,
revelations and so on.

20:36.053 --> 20:37.532
Impressive.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.571
And does the Watchers
Council know...

20:40.733 --> 20:44.442
...you stole the only known copy
of the Codex when you left?

20:45.093 --> 20:46.685
There is no Council.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.643
Not anymore, no.

20:50.173 --> 20:52.368
So you opted to, what...

20:52.533 --> 20:54.205
...play for the other side?

20:54.373 --> 20:56.125
Cross the line?

20:56.293 --> 20:59.888
These are complicated times.
Lines become blurry.

21:00.053 --> 21:01.884
How did you know?

21:02.893 --> 21:05.009
Something about Watchers and...

21:06.853 --> 21:08.332
...libraries.

21:19.053 --> 21:21.009
LILAH:
Money, clothes, women.

21:21.173 --> 21:24.643
- Did I mention we have a juice bar?
ANGEL: This is what you came back for?

21:24.813 --> 21:26.531
To play <i>Let's Make an Evil Deal</i> ?

21:26.693 --> 21:29.605
LILAH: Show him what's behind
door number one, Bob.

21:30.173 --> 21:31.845
I know it's not much, but...

21:32.013 --> 21:34.368
...the Taj Mahal
was a bit of a commute.

21:34.533 --> 21:37.252
ANGEL: What, am I supposed to swoon?
It's an office.

21:37.413 --> 21:40.962
With your own private elevator.
Care to take it for a spin?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.522
What's it gonna do?
Drop me in a vat of holy water?

21:43.693 --> 21:46.651
I was pushing for that,
but they went with the motor pool.

21:46.813 --> 21:49.532
Figured you'd like to stay mobile,
with all that rushing...

21:49.693 --> 21:52.810
...to save the day you're so fond of.
- Thanks, but I have a car.

21:52.973 --> 21:55.533
- Now you have 12.
- What am I gonna do with 12 cars?

21:55.693 --> 21:59.129
Anything you want. That's the point.
Or haven't you been listening?

21:59.293 --> 22:02.126
I have.
And I'm done now.

22:02.293 --> 22:04.363
Wait.
I forgot to show you the best part.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.285
You're gonna love this.

22:11.053 --> 22:13.567
- I'm not bursting into flames.
- Nope.

22:14.933 --> 22:18.084
Necro-tempered glass.
The whole building's fitted with it.

22:18.253 --> 22:22.041
Helps keep those uplifting, wholesome
rays from charbroiling the boss.

22:22.213 --> 22:24.681
And 30 percent
more energy efficient.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.886
It feels even better when you're naked.

22:28.053 --> 22:29.486
I could turn around.

22:29.653 --> 22:31.689
- Close it.
- Promise I won't peek.

22:31.853 --> 22:34.731
- Well, maybe just a skosh.
- Close it, Lilah.

22:37.213 --> 22:40.922
Goodbye, Mr. Sunshine,
hello, Gloomy Avenger.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.129
Make that goodbye.
I'm not taking the job.

22:43.293 --> 22:45.932
It's not a job, it's an opportunity.

22:46.093 --> 22:48.812
Oh, an opportunity
to be part of the problem.

22:48.973 --> 22:50.452
If that's what you choose.

22:50.613 --> 22:53.286
- Really don't.
- Again, your choice.

22:53.453 --> 22:57.207
Think of what you could do with
the resources of Wolfram and Hart.

22:57.373 --> 22:58.806
The difference that would make.

22:58.973 --> 23:03.649
Nothing in this world is the way it
ought to be. It's harsh and it's cruel.

23:03.813 --> 23:05.724
That's why there's you, Angel.

23:06.133 --> 23:08.931
You live as if the world
were as it should be.

23:09.093 --> 23:11.732
With all this,
you can make it that way.

23:11.893 --> 23:14.407
People don't need
an unyielding champion.

23:14.573 --> 23:17.041
They need a man who knows
the value of compromise...

23:17.213 --> 23:20.603
...and how to beat the system
from inside the belly of the beast.

23:21.013 --> 23:22.412
The beast's belly?

23:22.573 --> 23:24.723
Doesn't that usually mean
you've been eaten?

23:24.893 --> 23:26.167
Maybe.

23:26.333 --> 23:30.246
While you've been namby-pamby-ing
around for the past 90 seconds...

23:30.413 --> 23:32.608
...six innocent people have died.
Don't worry...

...there's always six thousand more

23:41.973 --> 23:45.124
- Sunnydale.
- That nifty bauble comes with the file.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.683
Apparently it's crucial for
some kind of final battle.

23:48.853 --> 23:51.447
Guess they're in short supply
up Sunnydale way.

23:51.613 --> 23:55.606
A bit gauche for my taste.
But, hey, not a slayer.

23:57.333 --> 23:58.607

Not interested.

So how about open homicide?

I knew there had to be a reason
you took the tour. Dead, not stupid.

- What do you know?
- About where Cordelia and your son are?

24:15.453 --> 24:19.287
Not a thing. But you could find
out in about 10 seconds.

24:19.453 --> 24:23.605
All you gotta do
is pick up the phone, boss.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.924
I'm sorry what happened
to you, Lilah.

24:38.093 --> 24:39.526

- I think you broke my arm.
- Do it right.

28:33.653 --> 28:36.929
Shh. It's going to be okay.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.642
It's gonna be okay.

28:58.173 --> 29:00.004
You got in.

29:00.853 --> 29:02.650
Thought you might.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.251
I was wondering how long
it'd take you to get here.

29:41.253 --> 29:42.572
How'd I do?

29:43.133 --> 29:45.647
A little slower than I
would've thought.

29:47.573 --> 29:51.043
But then, you always did
like to take your time.

29:51.813 --> 29:53.326
So you finally made it.

29:53.773 --> 29:56.526
Got behind the facade,
and here it is.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.408
Every dirty little scheme,
every secret.

29:59.573 --> 30:01.609
All that evil, great and small.

30:02.173 --> 30:06.405
Just imagine what you could accomplish
with that kind of information.

30:08.693 --> 30:11.048
You wanted me to see this.

30:11.973 --> 30:15.283
- You knew I'd...
- <i>Die Hard</i> your way up here?

30:15.453 --> 30:18.525
Come on, Wes.
Who knows you better than me?

30:21.853 --> 30:24.128
Perhaps you don't know me
as well as you think.

30:28.253 --> 30:30.005
What are you doing, Wesley?

30:31.253 --> 30:33.130
Standard perpetuity clause.

30:35.893 --> 30:37.963
You broke in here for my contract?

30:38.133 --> 30:41.091
- I'm here to release you from it.
- Wesley...

30:41.613 --> 30:43.808
You've suffered enough.

30:48.773 --> 30:51.492
I want you to find some peace.

30:51.653 --> 30:53.166
Gallant to the end.

30:54.573 --> 30:57.371
But I knew what I signed up for.

31:03.053 --> 31:04.327
It's done.

31:06.173 --> 31:07.891
Look in the drawer.

31:17.173 --> 31:21.246
Flames wouldn't be eternal
if they actually consumed anything.

31:25.173 --> 31:27.971
But it means something
that you tried.

Connor?

31:43.093 --> 31:44.446
Son...

31:49.173 --> 31:50.891
You might not want to move.

31:52.093 --> 31:53.765
The people are rigged too.

31:55.533 --> 31:57.649
You can't save them all, Dad.

31:58.373 --> 32:00.762
You don't know who's gonna be first.

32:02.213 --> 32:04.124
Could be any one of them.

32:11.053 --> 32:13.169
Could be me.

32:17.253 --> 32:18.766
Could be her.

...you have to listen to me.

32:39.653 --> 32:42.645
- This is about Jasmine.
- Jasmine's gone.

32:43.373 --> 32:44.772
I know.

32:46.053 --> 32:49.887
We all felt it, that perfect love.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.605
- Then when we had to give it up...
- I didn't feel anything!

32:56.013 --> 32:57.924
I can't feel anything.

33:00.253 --> 33:05.122
I guess I really am your son
because I'm dead too.

33:05.533 --> 33:08.923
You're not dead.
You're just starting your life.

33:09.093 --> 33:11.653
No, you just weren't there before.

33:14.453 --> 33:16.330
I know.

33:16.813 --> 33:19.043
- I'm so...
- Do not say you're sorry!

33:22.893 --> 33:24.849
It doesn't fix anything.

33:25.773 --> 33:28.685
Okay, then let me say this.

33:30.173 --> 33:32.129
- I love you, son.
- It's a lie.

33:32.373 --> 33:35.251
- It's not.
- It's always a lie.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.449
My dead mother
couldn't even love me.

33:41.093 --> 33:43.482
You're wrong. She did.

33:43.653 --> 33:47.282
No. No, she knew she couldn't.

33:47.613 --> 33:51.447
She sacrificed herself
because she loved you.

33:54.093 --> 33:55.572
You tried to love me.

33:56.653 --> 33:58.609
At least I think you did.

33:59.213 --> 34:02.285
- I still do.
- But not enough to hang on, Dad.

34:03.213 --> 34:05.010
You let him take me.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.402

34:28.013 --> 34:33.326
Connor, you have to believe that
there are people who love you.

34:33.493 --> 34:35.802
Jasmine believed you
when you said you loved her...

34:35.973 --> 34:38.487
...but it was all a lie.
- Jasmine was the lie.

34:38.652 --> 34:40.052
No!

She knew if you found out
who she was you'd turn against her.

We can.

You and me, we can change things.

Roy, not so much.

Oh, and balance?

Very, very important.

Hope it's not just me.
But if it is, that's all right too.

there's probably a great deal...

Is anything further away than Russia?
