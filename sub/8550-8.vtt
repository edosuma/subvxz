CAN I HAVE A DOUGHNUT, TOO?

00:33.834 --> 00:35.103
DOUGHNUT?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.490
I ALWAYS ENJOY
GIVING TO CHARITY.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.526

TO PLAY ROUND BALL,
NOT NERD BALL.

BUT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING,
AND MY PROGRESS IS IMPRESSIVE,

03:55.035 --> 03:57.137
EVEN IF I DO
SAY SO MYSELF.

03:57.204 --> 04:00.808
SINCE NOBODY WILL PLAY WITH ME,
I HAVE TO SAY SO MYSELF.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.311
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.812

HE TALKED ME
INTO CAR POOLING.

SAVE US MONEY.

SOME LAME EXCUSE,

MONEY WE'VE BEEN SAVING
IS MURTAUGH'S.

HIS EXCUSE TODAY?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.099

BECAUSE HE GOT
HIS SLEEVE CAUGHT

IN HIS ELECTRIC TIE RACK,
AND HE ALMOST
SLAPPED HIMSELF TO DEATH.

WELL, I'VE NEVER TRIED OUT
FOR ATHLETICS BEFORE.

THE EQUIPMENT LIST SAID
GUYS SHOULD WEAR A CUP.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.040
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.843

WHAT'S THE MATTER,
DID YOU BREAK YOUR MUG?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.983
NO, IT'S JUST
THAT NO ONE WOULD
PASS ME THE BALL,

09:43.050 --> 09:45.585
AND I'M REALLY,
REALLY GOOD.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.922
LOOK, KID...

09:48.989 --> 09:50.991
YOU'RE NOT
A BASKETBALL PLAYER.

09:51.058 --> 09:51.925

09:51.992 --> 09:55.829
IN SHORT...
YOU'RE SHORT.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.798
BUT YOU DO HAVE SPUNK,

MAIN INGREDIENT?

11:36.964 --> 11:40.834
I KNOW, BUT AREN'T
OUR CHEERS A LITTLE
OLD-FASHIONED?

11:40.901 --> 11:43.871
OH, AND YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO HIP,
YOU LITTLE GEEK?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.742
I WAS JUST THINKING
WE COULD TRY
SOMETHING NEW.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.578
BY THE WAY,
IF YOU EVER
CALL ME GEEK AGAIN,

11:51.644 --> 11:54.114

THE IN CROWD?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.094
OH, YES, ABSOLUTELY.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.397
WELL, I'M NOT POPULAR
WITH THE CHEERLEADERS.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.300
THEY TREAT ME LIKE DIRT
BECAUSE I'M A FRESHMAN.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.436
THEY'RE MEAN TO ME.
THEY MAKE FUN OF ME.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.072
THEY...THEY...

13:59.139 --> 14:02.575
THEY TREAT YOU
THE WAY PEOPLE TREAT ME?

14:03.977 --> 14:07.347
YEAH. HOW DO YOU
STAND IT, STEVE?

14:07.414 --> 14:10.050
WELL, I JUST DON'T
LET IT BOTHER ME.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.754
YOU MEAN LAUGHING ON THE OUTSIDE
WHILE YOU'RE CRYING INSIDE?

14:14.821 --> 14:16.957
NO WAY.
WHY, IF YOU CRY
ON THE INSIDE,

14:17.024 --> 14:19.492
SOONER OR LATER
YOUR INSIDES MILDEW.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.197
THEN HOW
DO YOU HIDE THE HURT?

14:24.264 --> 14:25.365
YOU DON'T.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.800
I'VE LEARNED THAT IF YOU
FILL YOUR HEART WITH HOPE,

14:27.867 --> 14:30.203
THERE WON'T BE
ANY ROOM FOR HURT.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.107
LOOK, I TRIED OUT
FOR THE BASKETBALL TEAM,

14:34.174 --> 14:36.309
AND I ENDED UP BEING
EQUIPMENT MANAGER.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.846
BUT DO YOU SEE ME SULKING
AND MOANING?

14:39.913 --> 14:40.981
NO.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.251
OF COURSE NOT.
I DO THAT IN PRIVATE.

14:47.754 --> 14:51.158
I'VE DECIDED TO BE
THE BEST DARN
EQUIPMENT MANAGER

14:51.224 --> 14:53.093
THAT'S EVER
MANAGED EQUIPMENT,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.662
AND MAYBE NEXT YEAR
I'LL MAKE THE TEAM.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.367
YEAH. I'LL TRY TO BE
THE BEST CHEERLEADER
POSSIBLE.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.036
AND MAYBE NEXT YEAR
THEY'LL LEMME SHOW THEM
MY NEW CHEERS.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.205
ATTA WAY, LAURA.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.309
YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.245
NOW, STEVE...

15:12.312 --> 15:14.481
I'M GOING TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

15:14.547 --> 15:17.450
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO OVER EXAGGERATE
ITS IMPORTANCE

15:17.517 --> 15:20.620
OR READ MORE INTO IT
THAN REALLY IS THERE.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.323
OH, DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.826
THANKS FOR THE TALK.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.462
YOU LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

16:11.438 --> 16:14.574
LET'S SUPPORT OUR TEAM.
WE'RE CHEERLEADERS, REMEMBER?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.544
OH, SHUT UP.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.114
I ONLY CHEER
AT SPORTING EVENTS.
THIS IS A BLOOD BATH.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.523
PSST!

16:33.426 --> 16:35.295
LIEUTENANT...

16:35.362 --> 16:37.197
WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:37.264 --> 16:40.467
ROOTING FOR
MY OLD ALMA MATER--
WILLOW GLEN.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.603
WHAT DID YOU GET
YOUR LETTER FOR, HOME EC.?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.006
FOOTBALL, SIR.
ALL-CONFERENCE.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.908
I FIGURED YOUR SCHOOL
IS GOOD AT COOKING.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.278
THEY'RE NOT GOOD
AT BASKETBALL.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.714
THE GAME'S NOT OVER YET.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.190
OH!

17:04.091 --> 17:06.559
HERE. ALRIGHT.
I GOT YOU.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.794
OOP!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.329
OOF!

17:09.396 --> 17:10.663
OOH!

17:10.730 --> 17:13.600
DOWNEY,
GO IN FOR SANDERS.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.871
AREN'T WE RUNNING OUT
OF PLAYERS?

17:18.938 --> 17:20.273
WE SURE ARE, HONEY.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.843
WHENEVER THE CROWD
GOES "AW,"
WE LOSE ANOTHER GUY.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.213
IF THEY GO "AW"
ONCE MORE,

17:26.279 --> 17:28.115
WE'LL HAVE TO
FORFEIT THE GAME.

17:28.181 --> 17:28.981
[BLOWS WHISTLE]

17:29.048 --> 17:30.683
AW!
AW!
AW!

17:34.254 --> 17:36.423
COME ON, SIT HIM
DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.857
SIT HIM DOWN.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.527
WELL, MEN, WE MADE
A VALIANT EFFORT,

17:40.593 --> 17:44.931
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
WILLOW GLEN HAS FOUND
OUR ONE WEAK SPOT.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.534
W-WHAT'S THAT, COACH?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.835
BASKETBALL.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.472
WE ONLY HAVE FOUR
UNINJURED PLAYERS,

17:52.539 --> 17:55.308
SO I'LL TELL THE REF
WE'RE THROWING IN
THE TOWEL.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.710
WAIT, COACH.
PUT ME IN.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.978
WHAT?

17:59.045 --> 18:01.548
HAVE YOU BEEN
SNIFFING LINIMENT?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.484
NO, COACH,
REALLY, I'M GOOD.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.187
URKEL,
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.922
COACH, IF YOU
FORFEIT THE GAME,

18:09.989 --> 18:11.991
THEY MIGHT FIRE YOU.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.427
URKEL, YOU'RE GOING IN.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.603
OKAY, GO.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.238

STEVE IN.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.742
THEY'RE SENDING IN
THAT URKEL KID.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.077
WHAT?

18:31.144 --> 18:34.847
