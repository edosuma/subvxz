WEBVTT

01:40.349 --> 01:41.559
Huh?

01:44.186 --> 01:45.187
What the...

02:18.846 --> 02:19.972
Excellent.

02:29.106 --> 02:30.107
Hey, you. Stop!

03:05.768 --> 03:06.769
What?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.070
When you are ready.

03:25.162 --> 03:26.163
Again.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.256
Sorry,
some of us aren't perfect.

03:35.923 --> 03:37.258
Master Bruce, I'm afraid

03:37.341 --> 03:40.177
there's been another robbery
of a Wayne Enterprises company.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.847
That's the sixth one
in less than two weeks.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.557
Seventh.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.683
Where, Alfred?

03:47.017 --> 03:48.060
I didn't see him.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.603
I was doing the closing report.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.564
The next thing I knew,
I woke up with a headache.

03:51.939 --> 03:53.441
Guard said he was dressed in black.

03:53.899 --> 03:54.942
Same guy all right.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.194
Good morning, Commissioner.

03:57.611 --> 03:58.612
I Wish.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.656
He left something behind this time,
Mr. Wayne.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.450
Deadly little thing.

04:02.867 --> 04:03.868
Mean anything to you?

04:05.870 --> 04:07.872
Don't touch it.
You'll break the evidence chain.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.566
The match is over.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.109
Kyodai is the victor.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.904
<i>Don't be depressed, Wayne-sen.</i>

04:40.488 --> 04:44.033
You're not bad for a rich man's
pampered son.

04:51.707 --> 04:54.126
There's always someone better,
Kyodai Ken.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.212
Now apologize for your remark.

05:16.398 --> 05:17.900
Mr. Wayne. Mr. Wayne!

05:19.276 --> 05:20.361
Do you have any idea

05:20.444 --> 05:23.614
why someone has been robbing
and sabotaging your businesses?

05:23.948 --> 05:25.324
Two buildings burned down,

05:25.407 --> 05:26.408
another blown up.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.369
This one's computer system's wrecked.

05:28.702 --> 05:30.079
Miss Gleeson, how do you know that?

05:30.329 --> 05:32.665
A good reporter
has sources, Commissioner.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.375
Any comment, Mr. Wayne?

05:35.376 --> 05:36.460
If you'll excuse me.

05:40.464 --> 05:43.175
Hmph.
You can't ignore the press, Mr. Wayne.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.223
Hey, Bruce, wait up.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.309
Listen, it will only take a minute

05:52.393 --> 05:53.435
to get into my costume.

05:53.894 --> 05:55.020
Not this time, Dick.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.363
What's with him?

06:04.697 --> 06:05.781
Bat got his tongue?

06:06.115 --> 06:07.241
You know Master Bruce.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.243
He's not one
to discuss his feelings.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.661
Isn't that the truth.

06:11.328 --> 06:12.580
Something's eating him, Alfred.

06:13.163 --> 06:14.248
I don't know what.

06:14.957 --> 06:15.958
Yet.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.152
You practice as a man obsessed.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.500
I'm not good enough, Yoru Sensei.
I lost!

06:59.001 --> 07:01.211
Everyone loses now and again.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.339
I have to be the best there is,

07:03.589 --> 07:04.715
no matter what it takes!

07:05.507 --> 07:08.886
Defeat can be more instructive
than victory.

07:47.174 --> 07:49.969
So, the famous Batman.

07:50.177 --> 07:52.054
I am honored.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.682
However, my business is not with you.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.976
Leave and you may live.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.145
Stay and...

09:01.915 --> 09:03.042
Listen, dipstick.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.460
Batman's my pal.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.045
He can be a major jerk,

09:06.128 --> 09:07.212
but you gotta love him.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.215
And nobody tries to fillet him
when I'm around.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.595
Another time then.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.209
How does he do that?

09:49.630 --> 09:51.340
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.801
Come on.
There's nothing more to do here.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.596
"Thanks for saving my bacon, Robin."

09:57.888 --> 09:59.848
"Hey, no problemo, Batman."

10:05.312 --> 10:07.397
I thought samurai live
by a code of honor.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.192
That gas gun wasn't exactly
according to Hoyle.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.610
He's not samurai.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.613
He's ninja. They're spies and assassins.

10:14.988 --> 10:16.532
Their only code is to get the job done.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.492
I know him.

10:18.742 --> 10:19.743
Say what?

10:22.412 --> 10:24.498
He and Bruce Wayne were students
together in Japan,

10:24.873 --> 10:26.083
a long time ago.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.001
His name is Kyodai Ken.

10:28.877 --> 10:29.920
He was good.

10:30.003 --> 10:31.088
Yeah? How good?

10:31.296 --> 10:32.339
Good.

10:33.465 --> 10:34.508
I see.

10:35.759 --> 10:37.427
I'm sure there is more to these crimes

10:37.511 --> 10:39.388
against Bruce Wayne than meets the eye.

10:39.721 --> 10:41.849
What do we know
about the Bruce, after all?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.600
One of the richest men on the planet,

10:43.934 --> 10:45.978
but he comes off
like the ultimate Boy Scout.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.147
I think I'll just pop over

10:48.230 --> 10:50.566
to the Wayne charities reception tonight

10:51.108 --> 10:52.776
and see if I can't get some answers.

10:54.069 --> 10:55.070
Be careful, Summer.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.947
Wayne's got mondo clout in Gotham.

10:57.364 --> 10:58.365
Hey, Harry,

10:58.615 --> 10:59.741
I'm a big girl.

11:04.371 --> 11:07.416
Alfred, do you know anything
about Bruce's training in Japan?

11:07.791 --> 11:09.209
Of course, dear boy.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.628
I was there. Lovely country.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.297
I especially like the tea.

11:13.630 --> 11:15.924
You ever hear of somebody
named Kyodai Ken?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.342
Oh, indeed.

11:17.509 --> 11:20.012
He was the only student
at the martial art school

11:20.095 --> 11:22.472
who could consistently defeat
Master Bruce.

11:22.931 --> 11:24.349
A bad egg, that one.

11:24.474 --> 11:27.352
I think Bruce is worried
he can't take this ninja.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.104
He won't admit it, of course.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.773
He never admits fears, Master Dick.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.442
Haven't you learned that by now?

11:38.697 --> 11:39.698
Ah, Master Bruce.

11:39.781 --> 11:40.782
l...

11:41.742 --> 11:42.868
I'll be at the museum.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.661
I should be back by midnight.

11:47.122 --> 11:48.207
Do you think he heard us?

11:48.498 --> 11:49.541
Who can tell?

12:32.334 --> 12:34.711
Good thing
I decided to practice tonight.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.631
Yoru Sensei would hate
to lose that blade.

12:38.173 --> 12:39.466
It's 500 years old.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.718
True, and worth a fortune.

12:42.135 --> 12:44.096
I don't need it
to take care of you, Wayne.

12:55.607 --> 12:56.608
Stop!

12:59.361 --> 13:01.488
You have dishonored the dojo, Kyodai.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.116
You no longer have any place here.

13:04.324 --> 13:05.367
Go!

13:06.368 --> 13:08.287
You will pay for this, rich man's son.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.455
I'll take all that you hold dear,

13:10.664 --> 13:12.582
and then I will destroy you!

13:43.739 --> 13:45.282
Why have you been following me
all evening?

13:45.741 --> 13:46.742
How did you... Look.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.577
I know you don't like me much.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.162
But I have a job to do.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.788
It's late, Miss Gleeson.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.467
I did some research, Mr. Wayne.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.427
I know you spent some time in Japan.

14:05.677 --> 14:08.055
Do you think
this ninja person is connected to that?

14:08.805 --> 14:10.974
Have a nice trip, Mr. Wayne.

14:41.963 --> 14:44.591
You really think
this is a good idea, Master Dick?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.635
Bruce is hours overdue, Alfred.

14:46.718 --> 14:47.761
It's not like him.

14:48.136 --> 14:49.346
There's a tracker in his car.

14:51.431 --> 14:53.016
I'II feel better once I check it out.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.690
Godspeed, lad.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.247
Huh?

15:17.165 --> 15:18.458
Ah, the rich man awakens.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.293
Remember me?

15:21.920 --> 15:23.672
I remember you, Kyodai.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.133
Well, you should recall the man
you ruined.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.803
I was forced to become a thief
after I was cast out of the dojo.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.513
As I remember it,

15:31.596 --> 15:34.599
being a thief was what got you
thrown out in the first place.

15:35.058 --> 15:38.520
Of course, you never had to worry
about money, Wayne.

15:38.603 --> 15:41.064
A society parasite feeding off others.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.358
Flabby, soft, weak.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.361
It is too easy to defeat you.

15:49.906 --> 15:51.158
Where am I?

15:53.535 --> 15:55.537
I've stolen your bank codes
at each theft.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.372
Soon I will have them all.

15:57.789 --> 16:01.042
Then I'll transfer your money
to my own accounts.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.335
I don't get it.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.255
You mean you're nothing
but a common thief?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.675
Not a common thief, woman.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.052
A great thief. The best.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.014
And now the game is about to end.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.617
Ah, way to go, Dick.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.744
Master crime fighter.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.625
It appears we have an unexpected guest.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.376
I'll be back.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.892
Isn't it past
your bedtime, boy?

16:58.975 --> 17:01.102
Let's just see who's going sleepy-by

17:01.186 --> 17:02.729
in the next couple of minutes, huh?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.857
This isn't the movies, boy.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.742
Enough of this.
I have business I must attend to.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.392
Ah!

18:34.279 --> 18:35.947
Oh, really?

18:54.841 --> 18:56.593
You have gone soft, Wayne.

18:56.676 --> 18:59.095
Even a white belt could avoid
that throw.

19:04.267 --> 19:05.810
Tired, Mr. Wayne?

19:05.894 --> 19:07.896
I haven't even broken a sweat yet.

19:08.521 --> 19:09.522
Get up!

19:12.942 --> 19:14.319
Hang in there, Bruce.

19:18.823 --> 19:21.993
Stop it! Can't you see
he's no match for you?

19:22.077 --> 19:23.787
He never was.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.676
I have had enough exercise
for one night.

19:38.259 --> 19:39.969
Now it ends, Wayne.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.105
Hey!

20:05.078 --> 20:06.079
Yes!

20:10.500 --> 20:12.210
Gotten a second wind, have you?

20:12.669 --> 20:16.756
Good. This will make your defeat
all the more satisfying.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.591
Shut up and fight.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.774
You were right about one thing, Kyodai.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.359
Now it ends.

21:10.059 --> 21:11.227
So, what did you tell Summer?

21:11.436 --> 21:13.813
That Batman arrived
and took care of the ninja.

21:13.980 --> 21:14.981
That's true enough.

21:16.065 --> 21:18.485
The police couldn't find any trace
of Kyodai Ken.

21:18.860 --> 21:19.861
You think he escaped?

21:20.069 --> 21:22.030
Ninjas are very resourceful.

21:22.405 --> 21:23.698
Do you think he might return?

21:23.948 --> 21:24.949
It doesn't matter.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.326
I defeated him once.

21:26.659 --> 21:28.495
If necessary, I can do it again.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.039
He had you worried for a while though,
didn't he?

21:33.249 --> 21:34.250
Thanks for your help.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.836
It would have been harder to defeat him
with Summer watching.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.589
Maybe even impossible.

22:19.295 --> 22:20.296
English - SDH
