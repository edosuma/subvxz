00:04.829 --> 00:06.168
Target one's eliminated.

00:06.293 --> 00:08.200
Two and three have escaped,
we're in pursuit.

00:08.364 --> 00:09.932
We can't have witnesses.

00:10.356 --> 00:12.879
He gave the order
to have Jack Harkness killed.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.435
- Are you sure?
- I've seen it with my own eyes.

00:15.815 --> 00:16.996
We are coming.

00:18.204 --> 00:19.155
We are coming.

00:19.364 --> 00:21.646
Whoever they are,
they're coming for Britain.

00:22.046 --> 00:23.280
- Why?
- Exactly.

00:23.914 --> 00:25.833
Why is that, Mr Frobisher?

00:26.411 --> 00:29.029
He keeps saying the same thing,
over and over.

00:30.589 --> 00:31.846
I don't mean to scare you.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.600
You're perfectly safe but I think aliens
are using you to speak.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.799
- What do you think?
- There's no such thing.

00:39.614 --> 00:42.169
How do we know
that the 456 will keep quiet?

00:42.462 --> 00:43.320
We don't.

00:43.481 --> 00:45.439
All we can do,
is hope to cover ourselves.

01:15.073 --> 01:16.123
This is us.

01:17.065 --> 01:18.465
This is Torchwood.

01:19.899 --> 01:20.879
This is home.

01:24.254 --> 01:27.120
<i>The children promised tomorrow
and tomorrow is here.</i>

01:27.321 --> 01:30.040
<i>Our correspondents
have been measuring the situation...</i>

01:30.160 --> 01:33.360
<i>Le President a declare avoir ordonne
la fermeture de nos ecoles.</i>

01:33.837 --> 01:37.821
<i>The Senate have pointed out that
we're now livin'in fear of our children.</i>

01:38.241 --> 01:40.479
<i>In fear of what they will say next.</i>

01:40.920 --> 01:44.080
<i>In fear of who or what
is speaking through them.</i>

01:47.720 --> 01:49.119
Almost lost my eyebrows!

01:49.462 --> 01:52.293
Still, I'm good for something, see?
Old Boy scout!

01:52.641 --> 01:54.760
- I'm freezing.
- Is anyone gonna see us in here?

01:54.961 --> 01:58.360
- With all this firelighting stuff?
- It was abandoned in the'90s.

01:58.693 --> 02:00.880
Used to be a Torchwood holding facility,
Torchwood one.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.813
- Been rusting away for years.
- So what do we do?

02:05.281 --> 02:06.760
Just sit here?

02:06.961 --> 02:10.118
Worse than that, do I have to stay
in these clothes? I mean, come on.

02:10.394 --> 02:12.360
Tracksuit bottoms. Not a good look.

02:12.561 --> 02:15.200
Jack, they're arriving today.
That alien voice-thing

02:15.401 --> 02:19.119
said today and we're stuck
in the back end of beyond.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.372
But we're together.
The old team.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.320
We're down, but not out.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.880
We've survived worse than this.

02:28.755 --> 02:31.520
Besides, I don't know how much fighting
you should do, in your condition.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.586
What does that mean?

02:35.222 --> 02:37.532
- Christ. Jack!
- He knows you're pregnant?

02:37.841 --> 02:39.081
You told him before me?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.520
He happened to be there,
and it happened really, fast.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.727
Last to know! Last to bloody know!
Thank you very much!

02:44.847 --> 02:46.400
Don't be stupid, man.
Don't be...

02:48.200 --> 02:50.160
Couldn't you just keep it shut?

02:52.854 --> 02:53.959
All together.

02:54.951 --> 02:56.101
The old team.

02:56.771 --> 03:00.159
<i>Tension is mounting as the population
of the entire planet </i>

03:00.321 --> 03:01.960
<i>waits for the next incident.</i>

03:02.121 --> 03:05.400
<i>Le Parlement Europeen semble fige
au regard de ces...</i>

03:05.601 --> 03:07.581
<i>We've been given no answers,</i>

03:07.701 --> 03:10.199
no hope, no assurance

03:10.361 --> 03:12.000
that our children will come first...

03:12.294 --> 03:15.469
<i>The Government has refused
to speculate about the origin</i>

03:15.589 --> 03:19.280
<i>of the voice or the importance
of the word "tomorrow".</i>

03:19.521 --> 03:22.080
<i>Let's take you live now
to Downing Street.</i>

03:22.280 --> 03:25.221
In light of what's happening
with our children,

03:25.341 --> 03:27.680
we've temporarily
closed the schools.

03:28.109 --> 03:31.480
As a further precaution,
we have introduced a temporary curfew

03:31.600 --> 03:33.800
for everyone under the age of 18.

03:34.318 --> 03:36.920
<i>Keep your children at home,
where they'll be safe.</i>

03:37.600 --> 03:39.640
<i>The curfew takes effect immediately</i>

03:39.841 --> 03:42.000
and will continue
until further notice.

03:42.684 --> 03:43.720
<i>But rest assured.</i>

03:44.254 --> 03:47.734
<i>We are doing everything in our power
to find out what's going on,</i>

03:48.161 --> 03:52.120
<i>to safeguard our children
and all the people of this nation.</i>

03:53.481 --> 03:56.713
<i>In the meantime,
we are asking everyone to stay calm,</i>

03:57.462 --> 03:59.657
<i>and to go about
your lives as normal.</i>

04:00.698 --> 04:03.200
<i>There's nothing to suggest
we are in any danger,</i>

04:03.734 --> 04:06.334
<i>and as soon as we find out
anything more,</i>

04:06.870 --> 04:08.626
<i>the public will be informed.</i>

04:09.229 --> 04:12.286
<i>And as always,
I thank you, for your trust,</i>

04:13.412 --> 04:14.862
<i>and for your faith.</i>

04:25.210 --> 04:27.027
It's me, listen, I can't talk,

04:27.147 --> 04:30.040
just give her the thumbs up.
She'll know what it means.

04:33.201 --> 04:34.479
Brilliant! Thanks, Mac!

04:40.152 --> 04:42.402
Mac says, thumbs up, lanto's alive!

04:43.356 --> 04:47.200
Is that it? You daft sod,
well where is he, what's he doing?

04:47.531 --> 04:49.455
Thumbs up, that was all.
This is Eliza,

04:49.575 --> 04:51.744
and she's lactose intolerant,
so no milk.

04:52.244 --> 04:53.999
Right. You take your coat off,

04:54.161 --> 04:58.040
You go in there and play, all right?
That's it now, Johnny.

04:58.441 --> 05:00.553
No more kids! I'm full to bursting.

05:00.673 --> 05:03.747
It's a public service! The schools
are closed, people still got to work.

05:04.357 --> 05:06.520
- Life goes on!
- With you making a profit.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.279
Ten quid a kid. Look, that could be
our slogan, ten quid a kid!

05:20.147 --> 05:23.594
<i>This is Jack Harkness, leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

05:31.675 --> 05:33.160
So, we've got...
Guns,

05:34.506 --> 05:35.839
and a pen knife.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.022
Laptop, now dead.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.517
Credit cards and a phone,
which they can trace.

05:40.637 --> 05:41.800
Lemsip. Book of stamps.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.040
Pair of contact lenses.
And fifteen quid.

05:44.481 --> 05:45.928
Plus 25p.

05:46.048 --> 05:48.120
With some bloody alien thing
turning up today.

05:48.321 --> 05:49.919
We've got some Torchwood software.

05:50.081 --> 05:52.800
We've lost the Hub, but the software
still exists on the server.

05:52.961 --> 05:56.120
But we're gonna need
some more equipment, and electricity.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.898
And how are we gonna manage that,
hidden away like criminals.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.200
That's it. Brilliant!

06:02.857 --> 06:05.200
- What?
- Criminals. Thieves.

06:05.978 --> 06:06.783
Us.

06:07.615 --> 06:10.235
They're treating us
like criminals, let's be criminals.

06:10.355 --> 06:11.919
Listen, I trained with the police,

06:12.081 --> 06:15.113
I know every trick in the book!
I've seen the lot!

06:15.233 --> 06:17.999
Come on, boys.
You're gonna learn some tricks!

06:21.283 --> 06:22.588
Everything all right?

06:22.708 --> 06:25.654
- Fine, thanks very much.
- That'll be Â£15.50, please.

07:05.684 --> 07:07.399
Come back, that's my car.

07:18.056 --> 07:20.925
I'm just going to pop over the road.
I won't be a minute, OK?

07:30.672 --> 07:32.559
Excuse me,
could I borrow your phone?

07:33.126 --> 07:35.560
I just want to call my sister,
she's a bit worried with the kids.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.520
My mobile's not working. Is that OK?

07:37.640 --> 07:40.160
- Sure.
- I won't be long. Brilliant, thanks.

07:45.759 --> 07:47.906
<i>Hello, Cardiff Bay police station.</i>

07:49.231 --> 07:52.560
<i>I'm trying to contact Captain Harkness,
he works for Torchwood.</i>

07:52.721 --> 07:54.587
I know it's not your department,
but...

07:55.708 --> 07:57.649
I think he was in that explosion,

07:57.769 --> 08:00.405
I can't get in touch with him.
He's got this private number...

08:00.525 --> 08:02.200
<i>I'll need your name and address.</i>

08:03.146 --> 08:04.640
I just want to know where he is.

08:04.841 --> 08:07.045
<i>I'll need your name and address.</i>

08:10.293 --> 08:12.375
<i>Name and address, please.</i>

08:13.279 --> 08:16.027
Lovely, thank you very much.
Thanks.

08:34.903 --> 08:37.347
Name's Alice Carter,
maiden name Alice Sangster,

08:37.989 --> 08:39.880
Parents James and Mary Sangster,

08:40.039 --> 08:42.840
significant because James
and Mary Sangster never really existed.

08:43.504 --> 08:45.737
They were placeholder names,
used in the early 70s,

08:45.857 --> 08:49.075
for personnel that went into deep cover
or witness relocation.

08:49.241 --> 08:51.400
In other words,
the whole ID's a fake.

08:51.784 --> 08:54.434
- Can you find out who she is?
- I'm on to it.

08:57.841 --> 08:58.959
Let there be light!

09:03.207 --> 09:05.678
- Britain's most wanted!
- How about that?

09:06.410 --> 09:08.240
Guess that makes you
an official member.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.837
You can stick it, mate.
Get on those computers,

09:10.957 --> 09:12.237
and get me home.

09:12.357 --> 09:14.360
I see we've got a new car outside.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.322
Nice, very smart.

09:16.442 --> 09:17.880
Where've you been?
We thought you'd got arrested.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.640
Just buying essentials.

09:20.167 --> 09:21.424
Technology's one thing.

09:21.544 --> 09:24.039
Let's not forget the creature comforts.
Coffee, obviously.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.107
- Got some doda...
- Thank God.

09:28.106 --> 09:29.756
And more importantly...

09:30.511 --> 09:33.359
I didn't know your exact sizes,
but I reckon I've got a good eye.

09:36.136 --> 09:38.607
Brilliant, I am stinking!

09:39.057 --> 09:41.080
- Nice one!
- And for you, sir...

09:42.096 --> 09:44.359
- Army surplus special.
- You are kidding me!

09:51.784 --> 09:52.841
I'm back!

10:11.132 --> 10:15.075
Such a long time ago.
But it's all coming back. Isn't it?

10:15.871 --> 10:17.578
Cos of that smell...

10:18.491 --> 10:20.057
Closer and closer.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.135
Happens today, well,
it's always today, isn't it?

10:24.481 --> 10:26.065
Same as yesterday.

10:26.681 --> 10:28.320
Today and yesterday.

10:28.589 --> 10:31.200
I knew they'd come back.
Bastards always come back.

10:32.217 --> 10:33.559
I can smell them.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.032
Just like last time, isn't it?

10:38.934 --> 10:40.480
Stop. Stop.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.200
Stop!

10:50.967 --> 10:52.119
That's him...

10:52.646 --> 10:54.714
- Don't take me, they'll get me.
- Hold on.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.680
- Don't take me, get out of the way!
- That's it.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.257
Come on... you're making it worse.

11:01.899 --> 11:02.880
Stop!

11:03.276 --> 11:04.919
They'll get me, they'll get me.

11:08.144 --> 11:10.120
- And we're in!
- Just like the old days!

11:10.240 --> 11:12.600
I'll patch into the new channels,
see what's happening.

11:12.761 --> 11:14.879
- Black, no sugar?
- That's the one.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.929
No sign of anything. Empty skies.

11:17.049 --> 11:18.480
Right, what are we looking for?

11:18.681 --> 11:20.279
Run a check on that
Clement MacDonald

11:20.441 --> 11:23.279
See if any change.
And those names Lois said,

11:23.722 --> 11:26.280
Captain Andrew Staines.
Was it Ellen Hunt?

11:26.990 --> 11:30.200
Michael something. All assassinated
the same time they tried to kill Jack.

11:30.401 --> 11:33.601
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders, mean anything to you?

11:33.721 --> 11:34.783
Nothing.

11:35.787 --> 11:37.887
We need to get inside Whitehall.

11:40.581 --> 11:43.842
- Have you got the I5 software, lanto?
- It's still on the site, why?

11:43.962 --> 11:47.480
Download it onto the laptop...
cos these are not just contact lenses.

11:47.681 --> 11:49.880
These are Torchwood contact lenses.

11:50.081 --> 11:51.560
But what do we use them for?
Who's gonna wear them?

11:51.721 --> 11:53.600
There's only one person
still talking to us.

12:05.244 --> 12:07.667
Is there a Lois in here?
Lois Habiba?

12:08.508 --> 12:11.119
- That's me.
- We're not a call centre, hurry up.

12:13.454 --> 12:15.055
<i>Lois, look to your right.</i>

12:16.721 --> 12:20.305
<i>Don't hang up. Don't hang up.
I need five minutes. Just five minutes.</i>

12:23.681 --> 12:26.109
I've helped you once.
And that's enough.

12:26.561 --> 12:29.279
If anybody finds out what I'm doing...
It's treason.

12:30.018 --> 12:33.252
It's literally treason. Offences like this
can be tried without a jury.

12:33.372 --> 12:34.568
They could do anything
to me.

12:34.688 --> 12:37.560
You said they're building something at Thames House.
We need to find out what it is.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.768
That's the most secure building
in the whole country.

12:39.888 --> 12:42.680
- I can't smuggle you in!
- You don't have to.

12:47.321 --> 12:49.839
Keep your eyes open. Like this.

12:52.599 --> 12:53.437
But...

12:54.158 --> 12:56.240
where's that coming from?

12:57.295 --> 13:00.200
That's not a webcam, that's you.

13:02.601 --> 13:03.880
And to the right.

13:06.641 --> 13:08.121
And to the left.

13:12.241 --> 13:13.159
And back.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.200
Where's the camera? On your jacket?

13:16.553 --> 13:17.603
In my eyes.

13:18.623 --> 13:19.441
My God.

13:19.561 --> 13:22.869
When you wear these, they'll transmit
a picture so we can see what's going on.

13:22.989 --> 13:25.280
And more than that,
we've got lip-reading software.

13:25.595 --> 13:28.199
Just look at someone when
they're speaking, and it'll translate it

13:29.132 --> 13:30.920
Press enter now.
Go on.

13:32.869 --> 13:34.600
Now it's working. Say something.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.806
- Like what?
- <i>Like what?</i>

13:37.512 --> 13:39.838
- My God, that's weird.
- <i>My God, that's weird.</i>

13:40.997 --> 13:43.761
And we can send messages to you.
Type something.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.581
Go on, anything.

13:49.307 --> 13:52.200
- Hello Lois.
- You can see that? In your eyes?

13:52.938 --> 13:54.186
It's good, isn't it?

14:01.213 --> 14:03.439
If you wear these, we can find out
what's going on.

14:03.601 --> 14:07.041
- And then, we can help.
- But I can't. What if they...

14:08.054 --> 14:09.560
Scan for bugs, or something?

14:09.680 --> 14:12.039
- They won't register. I promise.
- I can't, though.

14:12.994 --> 14:14.438
Giving information's one thing.

14:14.601 --> 14:18.040
- That's putting me on the front line.
- You're the only friend we've got left.

14:18.931 --> 14:21.551
Even if I get into Thames House,

14:22.113 --> 14:24.975
I can't get on to Floor 13,
where they're building this thing,

14:25.095 --> 14:27.959
but Frobisher only takes Miss Spears
with him, I'm just the office girl!

14:28.120 --> 14:29.907
- You'll have to find a way inside.
- How?

14:30.027 --> 14:31.000
Don't know,

14:31.608 --> 14:34.128
- you'll have to think of something.
- I can't!

14:34.248 --> 14:35.760
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.710
Just take them with you,
I am begging you,

14:37.830 --> 14:39.759
- I've really got to go.
- Please, Lois.

14:42.036 --> 14:42.936
I can't.

14:44.026 --> 14:44.839
Please.

14:57.761 --> 14:59.240
Frobisher's the key to this.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.360
He's just a civil servant,
he's nothing.

15:02.081 --> 15:04.552
What makes him start
authorising executions?

15:10.422 --> 15:11.934
What did it feel like?

15:12.636 --> 15:14.759
I mean, getting blown up.

15:17.099 --> 15:18.599
It wasn't the best of days.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.439
But... did you feel it?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.870
Or did everything just go black?

15:28.501 --> 15:29.607
I felt it.

15:30.894 --> 15:31.821
Shit.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.639
D'you ever think that, one day,
your luck'll run out?

15:43.239 --> 15:44.947
That you won't come back.

15:50.024 --> 15:51.910
I'm a fixed point in time and space.

15:52.987 --> 15:54.887
That's what the Doctor says.

15:57.503 --> 15:59.719
I think that means it's forever.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.268
So... one day, you'll see me die

16:05.206 --> 16:06.263
of old age.

16:07.555 --> 16:09.055
And just keep going.

16:17.189 --> 16:18.679
Better make the most of it, then.

16:20.991 --> 16:21.891
Suppose.

16:25.163 --> 16:26.399
Like right now?

16:29.692 --> 16:31.440
lanto, the world could be ending.

16:31.892 --> 16:33.492
World's always ending.

16:34.442 --> 16:36.199
And I have missed that coat.

16:41.386 --> 16:44.320
D'you wanna take the car and go
to those shops, down by the Wharf?

16:44.440 --> 16:46.960
We need some disks for these things.

16:47.391 --> 16:49.800
- Should take about... 20 minutes?
- 30 minutes.

16:50.001 --> 16:52.359
I'll go later,
the beans are almost done!

16:53.838 --> 16:55.440
The beans are almost done.

16:56.326 --> 16:57.611
Bloody beans.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.839
That's nice, look at that...
face recognition software.

17:08.563 --> 17:09.458
And...

17:10.178 --> 17:12.861
arrested two hours ago in London.

17:13.275 --> 17:15.398
Wouldn't give his name,
but that is Clement MacDonald.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.660
- From the hospital.
- Could be useful.

17:19.301 --> 17:21.880
I've given her the contacts,
but God knows, I think she's too scared.

17:22.357 --> 17:23.780
<i>We've got a new mission for you.</i>

17:23.900 --> 17:26.290
That Clem's turned up,
in Camden police station of all places,

17:26.656 --> 17:28.787
<i>arrested for theft and minor affray.</i>

17:29.081 --> 17:31.728
- Could you get him out?
- How am I supposed do that?

17:31.848 --> 17:33.000
You're a policewoman.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.030
Bloody hell,
anything else while I'm at it?

17:35.388 --> 17:38.803
- Fillet steak would be nice.
- Don't push it, see you later.

17:39.441 --> 17:40.880
So lanto, what's his story?

17:41.530 --> 17:44.760
According to Gwen, it was
your classic alien abduction, as a kid.

17:44.961 --> 17:45.806
1965.

17:46.202 --> 17:48.319
He was living ten miles
outside Arbroath,

17:48.481 --> 17:50.646
the Holly Tree Lodge,
it was an orphanage.

17:51.541 --> 17:52.959
I looked up the files

17:53.121 --> 17:56.407
the kids're taken away in November 1965,
the Lodge's closing down,

17:56.527 --> 17:58.390
they were being taken
to a second-care home called

17:58.510 --> 18:00.682
Harbour Heights in Plymouth.
Except,

18:01.010 --> 18:03.520
that's where the records stopped,
there's no trace of them arriving.

18:03.681 --> 18:06.240
It was the'60s,
a lot of the paperwork's gone missing.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.693
But if what he's saying is true,
maybe they never got there.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.508
- Show me those people.
- What people?

18:12.628 --> 18:14.440
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.800
- D'you think there's a connection?
- Show me!

18:20.464 --> 18:22.414
Give me their history,
show me them 40 years ago.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.320
- What for?
- Just do it!

18:35.855 --> 18:37.239
Who are they, Jack?

18:39.871 --> 18:41.271
Did you know them?

18:45.739 --> 18:48.251
- I never knew their names.
- Who were they?

18:49.241 --> 18:50.599
Tell me. Did you know them?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.039
The beans are ready!

19:00.235 --> 19:04.105
Alice Carter. I've broken the security wall.
You're gonna love this.

19:05.502 --> 19:07.000
What is it? Any sign of Harkness?

19:07.161 --> 19:09.560
Sins of the past.
Did you know that he's got a daughter?

19:09.761 --> 19:10.814
Since when?

19:12.058 --> 19:15.560
She was put into deep cover way back
in 1977, at the request of her mother.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.262
Seeking to distance herself
from the life of Captain Jack,

19:18.382 --> 19:19.531
can hardly blame her.

19:19.651 --> 19:22.320
- Who was the mother?
- <i>Woman called Lucia Moretti.</i>

19:22.520 --> 19:26.200
Italian,
Torchwood staff, 1968 to 1977.

19:26.907 --> 19:30.077
Deceased, heart disease, 2006.

19:30.631 --> 19:32.480
Natural causes,
that's rare for Torchwood.

19:33.430 --> 19:36.520
<i>And now, Alice Carter's got a child
of her own, his grandson.</i>

19:37.265 --> 19:39.628
- <i>Could be useful, what we do?</i>
- Bring her in.

19:40.084 --> 19:41.834
Just the answer I wanted.

19:44.032 --> 19:46.600
Nothing from Jodrell Bank,
but we might as well get ready.

19:47.078 --> 19:50.493
Bridget, get everything you need,
we'll transfer to Thames House.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.242
What d'you want me to do?

19:53.362 --> 19:55.560
Exactly what you're doing now.
Just answer the phones.

19:56.420 --> 19:59.520
I could come with you
to Thames House. I could help.

19:59.879 --> 20:01.212
I don't think so.

20:04.610 --> 20:07.560
The thing is...
Mr Frobisher asked me to come.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.612
- When was that?
- He said he wanted me.

20:14.319 --> 20:16.596
- At his side.
- What for?

20:17.087 --> 20:20.715
- Why on earth would he need you?
- It was a...

20:21.797 --> 20:23.586
private conversation.

20:46.681 --> 20:49.120
You're not the first, you know.

20:49.321 --> 20:51.359
Don't go thinking you're the first.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.599
- Then I can come?
- Apparently so.

21:07.678 --> 21:08.887
<i>Andy, listen.</i>

21:09.007 --> 21:10.960
- You're alive?
- <i>I'm still alive.</i>

21:11.161 --> 21:13.440
- Now shut up, I need some help.
- We need you!

21:13.560 --> 21:15.245
All those kids saying,
"we are coming. "

21:15.410 --> 21:17.240
And that's today!
<i>What's it gonna be?</i>

21:17.360 --> 21:19.240
<i>A spaceship? Godzilla?</i>

21:19.441 --> 21:22.760
Just listen, I need you to release
a prisoner from Camden police station.

21:23.363 --> 21:25.880
- <i>The address is Albany Street.</i>
- What are you doing in Camden?

21:26.081 --> 21:28.274
- Does it matter?
- <i>It does to me,</i>

21:29.572 --> 21:32.818
I know, I'm sorry. Look, just listen,
I've got no ID, so I need

21:32.938 --> 21:35.800
you to vouch for me, he's only
on minor charges so I can stand bail.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.960
<i>You need to phone them,
and fax a WC242A.</i>

21:39.337 --> 21:41.920
Don't use my name,
use Lynda's, I'll say I'm Lynda...

21:42.121 --> 21:44.199
<i>Can you do that for me please?
Like now?</i>

21:56.801 --> 21:58.039
Do you remember me?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.410
It's all right.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.030
I've got you.

22:18.281 --> 22:20.435
It's boring. I want to see aliens.

22:21.525 --> 22:24.119
Be careful what you wish for.
Put some cartoons on.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.111
Come on, we're going out, quickly.

23:01.231 --> 23:04.781
- The telly said we've to stay inside.
- Never mind that, now listen to me.

23:05.461 --> 23:07.640
We're going to go out,
and you're gonna be quiet, OK?

23:08.230 --> 23:09.580
Don't make a sound.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.880
Just like those games
your gran taught you, remember?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.640
Gran always said,
there'd be trouble.

23:14.801 --> 23:17.720
Then do exactly what she said.
Just like the games. Nice and quiet.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.142
And don't let me out of your sight.
Come on.

23:23.676 --> 23:24.928
Clear! Clear!

23:49.678 --> 23:51.679
- Get out of the way.
- Go on then. Shoot.

23:51.841 --> 23:53.384
Let's see what happens.

23:54.622 --> 23:57.360
Are you as immortal as your father?
Is the boy?

23:59.761 --> 24:01.499
We can put it to the test.

24:02.116 --> 24:03.839
Take me. Let him go.

24:06.507 --> 24:09.095
- He's only a child.
- So?

24:11.300 --> 24:14.130
If we wanted you dead,
we'd have opened fire by now.

24:15.339 --> 24:16.939
Just put down the gun.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.040
- Who are you?
- Put down the gun.

24:21.742 --> 24:24.000
If you harm him. I will kill you.

24:24.981 --> 24:26.006
Understood.

24:33.686 --> 24:34.799
And the knife.

24:39.119 --> 24:41.520
Certainly your father's daughter,
I'll give you that.

24:42.537 --> 24:44.037
Come on, sweetheart.

24:46.489 --> 24:48.239
What is it, what are you doing?

24:50.147 --> 24:52.000
- What is it?
- What's he pointing at?

24:53.185 --> 24:54.040
Stop it.

24:54.773 --> 24:56.880
Please stop it! Look at me.

24:58.529 --> 24:59.429
Stop it!

25:01.075 --> 25:01.879
It's them.

25:05.001 --> 25:08.080
I charge extra for cleaning,
tell your mum, it's another two quid.

25:12.878 --> 25:13.928
What is it?

25:14.964 --> 25:15.959
Stop it.

25:22.984 --> 25:25.520
Can you hear me?
Lilly, it's Mum.

25:27.504 --> 25:29.813
Look at me. Just look at me!

25:34.341 --> 25:35.508
What is it?

25:43.080 --> 25:44.945
It's them, it's all of them,
the kids.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.198
What are they saying?

25:46.318 --> 25:48.188
I don't know, just pointing.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.055
<i>Yet again, every child has stopped,</i>

25:54.175 --> 25:56.802
<i>every single child in the world.</i>

25:57.441 --> 25:59.400
<i>There seems to be
no reports of speech.</i>

25:59.520 --> 26:03.080
<i>Only that they seem to be
indicating something in the sky.</i>

26:03.711 --> 26:05.363
It's on the news, they're pointing.

26:05.483 --> 26:07.520
I know,
but they're pointing over there.

26:08.438 --> 26:09.838
What's over there?

26:11.081 --> 26:13.456
It says, all the children in America
are pointing east.

26:13.576 --> 26:15.652
And all the children in Europe
are pointing west.

26:16.075 --> 26:16.919
It's us.

26:17.608 --> 26:18.800
They're pointing at us.

26:19.951 --> 26:23.349
If you go far enough in that direction
that's London.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.240
They're pointing at London.

26:29.554 --> 26:30.665
<i>According to reports,</i>

26:30.785 --> 26:34.927
<i>children in London are all pointing
towards the centre of the city.</i>

26:35.047 --> 26:38.181
<i>To repeat, children in London all seem
to be pointing</i>

26:38.361 --> 26:39.680
<i>towards the centre.</i>

26:39.841 --> 26:42.229
They're pointing at Thames House.
Come on!

26:47.282 --> 26:48.532
It's happening!

27:08.269 --> 27:09.724
Sorry, you stay here.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.542
We are here.

28:40.162 --> 28:42.236
It's them.
They're back.

28:44.858 --> 28:47.980
Come on. You're connected to them,
we need to find out how.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.800
<i>Speak.</i>

29:20.103 --> 29:21.811
My name is John Frobisher.

29:22.533 --> 29:24.505
Permanent Secretary
to the Home Office,

29:24.625 --> 29:27.066
of the United Kingdom
and Northern Ireland.

29:28.356 --> 29:29.156
Earth.

29:32.606 --> 29:34.080
On behalf of the Human Race...

29:39.303 --> 29:41.053
Is there something wrong?

29:46.759 --> 29:48.360
Do you want me to continue?

29:55.212 --> 29:56.212
Then...

29:58.248 --> 29:59.898
...if I could request,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.450
for the purpose of communication...

30:05.280 --> 30:08.349
We've no name for your species.
What are you called?

30:08.544 --> 30:12.129
<i>You call us 456.</i>

30:13.210 --> 30:14.460
That's correct.

30:15.243 --> 30:17.640
<i>Then that is our name.</i>

30:36.255 --> 30:38.119
If I could request,

30:39.356 --> 30:41.205
on behalf of my government,

30:43.716 --> 30:45.759
what is it that you want?

30:52.512 --> 30:53.810
Can you hear me?

31:02.364 --> 31:05.215
I'm sorry, but I need to know,
before I approach my superiors,

31:05.335 --> 31:06.840
what exactly do you want?

31:09.290 --> 31:12.906
I must ask the 456, officially,
your purpose in visiting...

31:13.026 --> 31:14.113
<i>Speak.</i>

31:14.233 --> 31:15.280
I AM speaking!

31:16.284 --> 31:17.876
<i>We would speak.</i>

31:20.008 --> 31:21.008
With who?

31:21.900 --> 31:23.120
<i>The world.</i>

31:28.560 --> 31:29.280
Why?

31:31.345 --> 31:33.040
<i>We would speak.</i>

31:38.739 --> 31:40.846
Well, perhaps we do
things differently here,

31:40.966 --> 31:44.373
but we would consider this
to be a diplomatic liaison.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.830
Does that make sense?

31:48.648 --> 31:50.360
We are both,
in a sense, ambassadors.

31:50.919 --> 31:54.155
According to protocol, ambassadorial
procedure is not made public.

31:54.275 --> 31:56.644
You wouldn't be speaking
to the entire population,

31:56.764 --> 31:58.603
but to their elected
representatives.

31:58.723 --> 32:01.026
That's, that's, that's how it works.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.900
That's all I can offer.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.040
Is that acceptable?

32:14.215 --> 32:14.960
Yes.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.200
Good.

32:20.840 --> 32:21.840
Thank you.

32:22.445 --> 32:23.774
Bring them.

32:26.899 --> 32:27.899
Thank you.

32:39.427 --> 32:41.002
I have one

32:41.997 --> 32:42.997
condition.

32:46.266 --> 32:48.920
Does that make sense, d'you
understand that? A condition?

32:57.819 --> 33:00.920
The 456 have made contact
with this country before.

33:03.325 --> 33:04.575
Many years ago.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.140
It would be better if...

33:10.338 --> 33:13.038
I mean, given the
nature of that meeting...

33:16.803 --> 33:19.229
It would ensure the smooth-running
of diplomatic relations

33:19.349 --> 33:20.778
between Earth and the 456

33:20.898 --> 33:23.520
if that previous encounter
was kept off the record.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.840
By off the record, I mean, private.

33:28.103 --> 33:29.207
Between us.

33:32.060 --> 33:33.360
Can you do that?

33:43.477 --> 33:44.560
<i>Yes.</i>

33:49.011 --> 33:50.011
Thank you.

33:50.669 --> 33:51.687
<i>Soon.</i>

33:53.018 --> 33:53.720
Sorry?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.280
<i>Return.</i>

33:55.938 --> 33:56.938
<i>Soon.</i>

33:58.017 --> 33:59.017
I will.

34:02.132 --> 34:03.132
Thank you.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.119
<i>The area around Thames House</i>

34:33.279 --> 34:35.114
<i>is being cordoned off
while the Government...</i>

34:35.335 --> 34:37.560
It's all kicking off now.

34:37.937 --> 34:39.920
- Just when we need Jack.
- <i>... at Downing Street.</i>

34:40.040 --> 34:42.476
<i>These images are from
five minutes ago.</i>

34:42.596 --> 34:45.043
<i>'That's been identified
as Colonel Oduya</i>

34:45.163 --> 34:47.480
<i>of the Unified
Intelligence Task Force</i>

34:48.036 --> 34:51.239
<i>and this is coming live
that's General Austin Pierce,</i>

34:51.400 --> 34:53.902
<i>representing the
American Armed Forces,</i>

34:54.161 --> 34:56.440
<i>he's heading
inside Downing Street right now.</i>

34:58.500 --> 35:01.402
I have been asked to convey, from
the President of the United States,

35:01.522 --> 35:03.040
his absolute fury.

35:06.329 --> 35:08.600
- Is that understood?
- Very much so.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.227
That landing wasn't spontaneous.
It was planned,

35:11.347 --> 35:12.760
it was prepared, by you.

35:13.461 --> 35:16.120
And don't go calling
this diplomacy, Mr Green...

35:16.320 --> 35:18.074
you have established a court.

35:18.194 --> 35:20.160
The sovereign court
of Great Britain.

35:20.612 --> 35:23.472
In direct contradiction of the
statutes of the United Nations.

35:23.592 --> 35:26.240
- We were acting under orders.
- Did they threaten you?

35:27.617 --> 35:30.855
I think we can say, the mere
existence of the 456 is a threat.

35:30.975 --> 35:32.125
Nevertheless,

35:32.920 --> 35:36.256
you have an alien ambassador,
on British soil.

35:36.376 --> 35:39.040
It has to be said, that Britain
has claimed no rights of territory

35:39.200 --> 35:41.440
or ownership over species 456.

35:41.560 --> 35:42.480
But it's here!

35:43.840 --> 35:45.200
Damned well got it right here!

35:45.425 --> 35:48.469
And at every stage of these
negotiations, you have excluded UNIT.

35:48.589 --> 35:51.160
When we're specially trained
to deal with these situations.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.580
And I apologise.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.705
But the President's
welcome to enter Floor 13,

35:55.825 --> 35:58.520
as is every other leader
of the free world,

35:59.109 --> 36:00.920
I'd be honoured.
- Except that's impossible.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.080
And you know it.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.571
We'll not move the President into a
location that's had no security screen.

36:05.691 --> 36:08.040
That would take days to organise,
weeks!

36:08.952 --> 36:10.280
Then I offer to withdraw.

36:12.294 --> 36:13.794
What does that mean?

36:16.410 --> 36:19.610
I won't usurp the United States,
or any other nation.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.440
I suggest that dialogue with
the 456 is taken out of my hands.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.480
And conducted by the civil service.

36:27.355 --> 36:28.680
They're still British.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.590
But not elected,
with no authority of State.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.080
And that's exactly what we need.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.160
Middle men.

36:39.667 --> 36:43.280
John Frobisher's already spoken
to the 456, I suggest he continues.

36:43.595 --> 36:45.240
I'd suggest that UNIT steps in.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.599
I wish it were so.
But the 456 chose Britain.

36:50.719 --> 36:52.669
They designated the location.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.770
It's out of my control.

36:56.726 --> 36:58.926
What d'you want to do, anger them?

36:59.740 --> 37:00.740
Look...

37:02.228 --> 37:03.800
John Frobisher's a good man.

37:05.626 --> 37:07.176
And better than that,

37:08.465 --> 37:09.600
he's expendable.

37:13.771 --> 37:15.171
So what d'you say?

37:22.562 --> 37:24.762
Do we have your absolute guarantee

37:25.737 --> 37:29.037
that you won't enter the room?
- My absolute guarantee.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.840
Then that's agreed.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.320
Agreed.

37:48.511 --> 37:50.102
- <i>John?</i>
- Prime Minister, Sir.

37:50.222 --> 37:53.060
<i>'We've consulted with the military,
they've demand that from now on</i>

37:53.180 --> 37:57.101
<i>you become our spokesperson
in all negotiations with the 456.</i>

37:57.480 --> 38:00.720
<i>Simon can give you a security
briefing, thank you.</i>

38:04.061 --> 38:04.720
Shit.

38:05.230 --> 38:07.180
Oh, but I'm the last to know.

38:07.357 --> 38:10.000
My own husband, and he
won't tell me what's going on.

38:10.326 --> 38:14.082
I've got the girls, pointing
at the sky, and he won't say!

38:14.925 --> 38:18.775
No, there's nothing, I've been
flicking through the news channels,

38:19.861 --> 38:21.711
no-one's saying anything...

38:22.759 --> 38:24.159
Yeah, yeah I know.

38:25.073 --> 38:27.523
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.600
OK. Bye.

38:32.647 --> 38:36.360
Lilly! Downstairs, please,
I want you where I can see you.

38:41.496 --> 38:45.424
<i>The so-called pillar of fire has
brought central London to a halt.</i>

38:45.720 --> 38:48.760
<i>All roads leading to the
river have been closed off,</i>

38:48.880 --> 38:52.800
<i>as a result all major thoroughfares
have ground to a standstill.</i>

38:52.920 --> 38:56.200
<i>Motorists are being asked
to stay out of the city centre.</i>

38:56.360 --> 38:57.720
<i>except for emergencies.</i>

38:57.880 --> 39:01.080
Oh, that's so bloody Jack,
you should've stopped him!

39:02.163 --> 39:04.524
Well, I don't know!
We're gonna be ages, it's gridlock.

39:04.644 --> 39:05.844
Bloody London!

39:07.435 --> 39:09.508
Half the people are panicking
and trying to get out,

39:09.628 --> 39:11.335
the other half is trying to get in.

39:11.455 --> 39:13.680
Look, I'm going to have to go, OK?
Bye.

39:13.880 --> 39:17.080
Ey, it's all right, Clem.
You're safe. You're with me.

39:17.386 --> 39:18.760
You're safe. You're with me.

39:19.766 --> 39:22.610
- You're all right, you're safe.
- I keep remembering more.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.440
It's not just them, up there.

39:26.762 --> 39:27.912
It's the man.

39:28.653 --> 39:31.103
He's come back.
After all these years.

39:32.336 --> 39:34.386
- I can smell him.
- What man?

39:34.659 --> 39:35.659
Who is he?

39:36.468 --> 39:37.760
The same man.

39:39.471 --> 39:40.800
I knew he'd come back for me.

39:41.148 --> 39:44.148
All right. It's time
I got you a nice cup of tea.

39:45.099 --> 39:47.960
And a hot dog. D'you like hot dogs?
I bloody love 'em.

40:03.556 --> 40:05.360
<i>I'm recommending we start at 19.00.</i>

40:05.520 --> 40:09.000
Gives us another two hours. Now
this is Louise, she can advise

40:09.120 --> 40:12.200
on international diplomatic
protocols, same goes for Samuel...

40:12.575 --> 40:14.675
There's a creature in that room.

40:15.602 --> 40:19.602
It's powerful, and it's toxic,
and it's capable of God knows what.

40:21.553 --> 40:24.683
I bet you're glad to be
trotting after John Frobisher now.

40:25.002 --> 40:26.535
<i>Stuart's the linguistics expert,</i>

40:26.655 --> 40:28.799
he can help out, if there's
a problem with translation.

40:28.919 --> 40:31.019
Excuse me, I'd better take this.

40:32.205 --> 40:34.560
I was gonna phone you.
God, I wish I was home right now.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.720
Look, just tell the girls that
there's nothing to worry about.

40:38.027 --> 40:39.800
Oh, I'll tell them that, Johnny boy.

40:39.960 --> 40:43.573
I'll tell them that their father tried
to have me killed, how about that?

40:43.693 --> 40:45.960
That's my wife's phone,
how did you get my wife's phone?

40:46.458 --> 40:48.328
This is 1965, isn't it?

40:49.313 --> 40:51.894
All of this, because of 1965.

40:53.244 --> 40:55.440
Frobisher, tell me, is it them?

40:55.560 --> 40:56.840
Have they come back?

41:00.127 --> 41:00.880
Yes.

41:03.471 --> 41:05.120
That's why you tried
to have me killed.

41:06.396 --> 41:10.120
Along with Andrew Staines
and Ellen Hunt and Michael Sanders.

41:10.950 --> 41:13.480
All of us dead, so no-one
could say anything, is that it?

41:14.032 --> 41:15.280
I had no choice.

41:16.318 --> 41:17.680
Well, I've got a choice...

41:18.726 --> 41:20.120
<i>D'you want to hear my choice?</i>

41:20.460 --> 41:22.880
I could blow this thing sky-high.
I could tell the world!

41:23.887 --> 41:26.237
<i>Unless you get me into Thames House.</i>

41:26.869 --> 41:29.280
I demand to talk to the 456 myself.

41:30.945 --> 41:32.195
<i>Think about it.</i>

41:33.131 --> 41:35.840
The fact that they've come back
proves that they can't be trusted.

41:38.080 --> 41:38.960
You need me.

41:39.869 --> 41:43.382
Captain, we have your daughter
and grandson,

41:44.132 --> 41:46.720
<i>Alice and Steven Carter
in our custody.</i>

41:46.969 --> 41:47.840
You what?!

41:48.121 --> 41:50.961
I promise, nothing will
happen to them. My absolute promise.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.520
So long as you agree to say nothing.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.600
Well, how about I go back into that
house, right now, and get your wife?

41:58.255 --> 41:59.631
<i>And your children?</i>

42:00.710 --> 42:02.060
Except you won't,

42:02.520 --> 42:04.440
cos you're a better man than me.

42:08.090 --> 42:09.390
I'm sorry, Jack.

42:18.816 --> 42:21.453
<i>The world
is still waiting for any news</i>

42:21.927 --> 42:23.124
<i>from Thames House.</i>

42:23.244 --> 42:26.170
<i>So far, the British Government
is maintaining a policy</i>

42:26.290 --> 42:28.294
<i>of absolute silence.</i>

42:28.414 --> 42:30.214
<i>And the waiting continues.</i>

42:37.182 --> 42:38.440
There you go.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.720
Save some for the rest of us, mate!

42:41.122 --> 42:42.880
He's your husband?

42:43.080 --> 42:44.880
Yes. Yes, my beloved.

42:45.822 --> 42:47.160
Nice house, isn't it?

42:48.414 --> 42:50.560
- Well, we do our best!
- It's got shower facilities.

42:51.640 --> 42:53.200
Just stand under the skylight.

42:55.393 --> 42:57.085
I've stayed in worse.

42:57.669 --> 42:59.120
And who's that queer?

43:05.258 --> 43:06.840
It's not 1965 any more.

43:09.622 --> 43:11.160
He's queer. I can smell it.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.767
If the support staff
could take the stairs,

43:22.887 --> 43:26.487
the lift is reserved for Mr Frobisher
and his personal staff.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.360
Fast as you can.

43:29.115 --> 43:30.516
Best of luck, sir.

43:37.631 --> 43:38.631
Big moment.

43:40.671 --> 43:41.671
History.

43:45.382 --> 43:47.143
- What d'you think's in there?
- God knows.

43:47.263 --> 43:50.040
That's why we need Lois.
- No sign of her. Lenses inactive.

43:52.283 --> 43:53.400
Two minutes!

43:57.720 --> 43:59.270
Um. I'm just gonna...

44:00.000 --> 44:01.100
Pay a visit.

44:33.669 --> 44:35.800
- Online! She's doing it!
- Oh, good girl!

44:36.163 --> 44:37.200
I knew she would!

44:42.280 --> 44:43.256
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:43.385 --> 44:44.639
Don't do too much of that.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.571
- <i>Don't do too much of that.</i>
- Sorry.

44:46.691 --> 44:48.280
- She can't hear you.
- I know.

44:49.595 --> 44:51.095
<i>Is that you, Gwen?</i>

44:52.130 --> 44:53.840
<i>Yes its me</i>

44:59.316 --> 45:00.202
Right then.

45:02.327 --> 45:03.918
- Good luck.
- <i>Good luck.</i>

45:05.610 --> 45:07.520
Oh, don't do that, I hate smileys.

45:10.572 --> 45:12.560
Took me a while to get
used to those things.

45:14.651 --> 45:16.458
What, you've used the lenses?

45:16.578 --> 45:19.120
- That's why Gwen had them.
- I took them home for a bit of fun.

45:20.506 --> 45:21.756
- Fun?
- Yeah.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.621
You know. Fun.

45:25.925 --> 45:27.760
Yeah, well been there, done that.

45:28.420 --> 45:29.840
- It is fun.
- Yeah.

45:36.563 --> 45:38.040
That's him, that's John Frobisher.

45:38.584 --> 45:39.360
Bastard!

45:39.560 --> 45:41.645
Fat lot of good that is,
back of his head,

45:41.840 --> 45:43.720
how do we know
if he's saying anything.

45:46.511 --> 45:48.261
I suppose it's an honour.

45:48.544 --> 45:50.044
Given this position.

45:51.520 --> 45:55.370
Then again, the Prime Minister has
guaranteed that diplomatically,

45:55.716 --> 45:57.416
he can't enter Floor 13,

45:58.309 --> 46:00.259
so whatever happens in there,

46:00.880 --> 46:02.480
whatever goes wrong...

46:02.975 --> 46:05.625
history will say that
it wasn't his fault.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.910
D'you mean he's using me?

46:11.181 --> 46:14.081
You don't get to be
Prime Minister by accident.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.120
What the hell is that?

46:45.019 --> 46:46.120
Some sort of tank.

46:48.791 --> 46:51.041
There's something inside the smoke.

47:33.591 --> 47:34.880
Clem, come and see this.

47:37.096 --> 47:39.120
Oh, come on, don't be scared,
it's miles away.

47:41.210 --> 47:42.560
What d'you think?

47:45.236 --> 47:47.136
Anything you've seen before?

47:48.744 --> 47:50.494
Can't smell it from here.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.080
Is that what tried to take me?

47:58.583 --> 47:59.720
Yeah, I think so.

48:16.096 --> 48:18.040
Seen anything like it before?

48:18.476 --> 48:19.240
Never.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.400
If I might bring into session,
the first diplomatic congress

48:22.520 --> 48:26.360
between representatives of Planet Earth
and the representatives of the 456.

48:26.770 --> 48:29.105
I bring you formal greetings
from the United States of America

48:29.590 --> 48:31.720
from the People's Republic
of China...

48:33.578 --> 48:35.880
- He's got his back to us!
- Yeah, I can see that!

48:37.647 --> 48:39.440
...from the Holy Sea
of Vatican City...

48:39.600 --> 48:40.960
- Need his moth?
- Shut up!

48:41.160 --> 48:43.480
...from the Russian Federation
and associated...

48:46.400 --> 48:49.200
...of Australia,
from the provinces and territories...

48:51.280 --> 48:53.609
...and Japan,
and the Hellenic Republic,

48:53.729 --> 48:56.440
from the Islamic Republic of Iran
and the Republic of Iraq,

48:56.796 --> 49:00.200
from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and it must be stated on the record

49:00.320 --> 49:02.124
that any country not named herein

49:02.244 --> 49:04.200
does not indicate
their withdrawal from this...

49:04.580 --> 49:05.840
That's it.

49:06.527 --> 49:08.240
Come on, good girl.

49:08.440 --> 49:12.280
...reflects only the time span within
which this summit has been declared.

49:13.880 --> 49:17.040
You've got eyes.
You've got eyes in the room.

49:17.367 --> 49:19.480
Software's not so good in profile.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.364
And according to the rules
of protocol, as established by...

49:23.880 --> 49:26.200
- It's not too bad.
- It's working.

49:29.971 --> 49:31.960
- You hate smileys.
- Shut up.

49:32.160 --> 49:35.560
I must ask you to state whether
these greetings are accepted.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.280
Do you understand me?

49:55.440 --> 49:57.090
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

50:04.576 --> 50:07.508
I repeat, according to the rules of
protocol, as established by the

50:07.651 --> 50:09.560
United Nations in the directives...
- <i>Yes.</i>

50:17.269 --> 50:18.716
Then I thank you on behalf of...

50:18.839 --> 50:21.192
<i>Then I thank you
on behalf of the United Kingdom.</i>

50:21.312 --> 50:22.514
Did it speak?!

50:22.638 --> 50:25.160
It hasn't got a mouth,
it's got bloody speakers!

50:26.342 --> 50:28.033
It hasn't got a mouth!

50:29.160 --> 50:32.200
<i>The Russian Federation,
the Commonwealth of Australia...</i>

50:32.360 --> 50:34.200
and territories of Canada
- <i>Can't hear alien</i>

50:34.360 --> 50:36.434
and Japan and the Hellenic Republic,

50:36.554 --> 50:39.240
the Islamic Republic of Iran
and the Republic of Iraq...

50:40.197 --> 50:42.746
- It's bloody shorthand!
- No, I can read it,

50:42.866 --> 50:45.160
it says "yes".
- This is a nightmare!

50:45.453 --> 50:46.984
...and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

50:47.104 --> 50:50.240
It might be easier if we take those
names as read from now on, don't you?

51:08.834 --> 51:11.560
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

51:14.381 --> 51:16.560
- "What's it doing?"
- What, is that what it said?

51:16.991 --> 51:18.480
No, that's Lois, saying that!

51:21.760 --> 51:23.524
- Are you all right?
- <i>God knows</i>

51:29.246 --> 51:31.640
I'm sorry, but I can't help being
concerned, is there a problem?

51:31.800 --> 51:35.200
<i>I'm sorry, but I can't help being
concerned, is there a problem?</i>

51:41.401 --> 51:43.251
Do you want me to continue?

51:44.320 --> 51:45.240
<i>Yes.</i>

51:49.254 --> 51:49.880
Yes.

51:50.580 --> 51:51.680
<i>Right, then.</i>

51:52.742 --> 51:54.320
<i>In the spirit of cooperation...</i>

51:54.520 --> 51:56.870
we have a formal request to make.

51:58.706 --> 52:01.906
We ask you not to use our
children for communication.

52:03.793 --> 52:06.160
<i>In case certain
parties or territories</i>

52:06.320 --> 52:08.420
<i>might consider that a violation.</i>

52:11.770 --> 52:13.220
Is that acceptable?

52:26.082 --> 52:26.720
<i>Yes.</i>

52:29.896 --> 52:30.640
Yes.

52:32.078 --> 52:32.880
<i>Thank you.</i>

52:35.637 --> 52:37.902
Ask it, why it came to Britain.

52:39.646 --> 52:41.240
Hardly top of the agenda.

52:43.630 --> 52:45.240
Ask the question.

52:46.584 --> 52:49.869
<i>And, as a gift,
and as welcome to this world,</i>

52:50.960 --> 52:54.610
we've prepared a document
summarising our culture and history.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.480
This document can be made
available to you immediately.

52:57.872 --> 52:59.796
Though its format remains
undetermined.

52:59.916 --> 53:02.530
Said format
remains of your choosing,

53:02.650 --> 53:05.901
though this does not constitute
a request for information on,

53:06.021 --> 53:08.720
or transfer
of specific 456 technology.

53:23.473 --> 53:26.673
I have been given a request
for specific information.

53:27.265 --> 53:28.765
It has been asked...

53:30.835 --> 53:33.516
...why the 456 chose Great Britain

53:34.820 --> 53:38.040
as its chosen point of embarkation.

53:41.856 --> 53:43.318
<i>We came here...</i>

53:46.265 --> 53:47.615
"We came here... "

53:48.129 --> 53:49.680
- Because?
- That's all it's said!

53:51.315 --> 53:54.240
<i>You have no significance.</i>

53:56.338 --> 53:57.920
<i>You are middle men.</i>

53:59.451 --> 54:02.351
"You have no significance,
you are middle men. "

54:02.657 --> 54:05.558
That's a lie, cos it's been here before
that's why it's here now.

54:05.678 --> 54:06.696
Why's it lying?

54:06.816 --> 54:08.066
It's Frobisher.

54:09.165 --> 54:11.015
He's got that thing to lie.

54:12.106 --> 54:13.440
They're on the same side.

54:13.862 --> 54:16.862
Whatever happened in the past,
they're hiding it.

54:26.539 --> 54:28.840
<i>We have a request.</i>

54:29.488 --> 54:30.638
By all means.

54:31.646 --> 54:33.238
We want a gift.

54:34.657 --> 54:35.657
Of course.

54:36.657 --> 54:37.657
But...

54:37.972 --> 54:39.120
what nature of gift...

54:39.406 --> 54:41.671
<i>What nature of gift exactly?</i>

54:43.345 --> 54:44.440
"A gift. "

54:45.066 --> 54:46.200
Gladly.

54:46.743 --> 54:48.040
But what d'you want?

54:50.325 --> 54:51.325
<i>We want...</i>

54:52.392 --> 54:53.320
<i>your children.</i>

54:57.455 --> 55:00.280
<i>We will take your children.</i>

55:03.023 --> 55:05.920
What does it mean, children?!

55:06.309 --> 55:07.720
"We will take your children. "

55:11.765 --> 55:13.165
What the hell for?

55:17.388 --> 55:19.960
Sorry, I think that there might be
a problem, with the translation.

55:22.167 --> 55:25.867
They want to take them, like
they did before, like the man did.

55:28.074 --> 55:29.280
He's coming back.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.600
- He's coming back.
- Not now Clem, just wait.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.880
He's coming, he's coming.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.080
He's coming.

55:35.280 --> 55:39.000
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.365
He's coming.

55:41.955 --> 55:44.680
He's coming. He's coming. He's
coming. He's coming. He's coming.

55:46.415 --> 55:49.160
- By children, you mean...?
- <i>Your descendants.</i>

55:50.587 --> 55:53.656
<i>The offspring of the Human Race.</i>

55:57.999 --> 55:59.024
How many?

55:59.144 --> 56:00.311
<i>10%.</i>

56:02.493 --> 56:05.131
<i>We want 10%.</i>

56:07.974 --> 56:11.860
<i>We want 10% of
the children of this world.</i>

56:19.720 --> 56:21.480
He hasn't changed.

56:22.132 --> 56:23.320
He's the same.

56:23.637 --> 56:24.960
He's the same.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.761
He's the same. All those years.

56:29.506 --> 56:32.120
- How can he be the same?
- What's he talking about, Jack?

56:34.342 --> 56:35.742
Clement MacDonald.

56:37.700 --> 56:39.040
Just another name.

56:43.080 --> 56:45.200
It was easier,
if you didn't know the names.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.090
You were there?

56:51.412 --> 56:52.520
In 1965.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.530
Walk into the light. Go on.

56:56.016 --> 56:57.266
He was the man!

57:02.160 --> 57:05.040
No, no, this is what he does,
you see, he fights them.

57:05.240 --> 57:07.840
He fights aliens,
isn't that right, Jack?

57:10.351 --> 57:11.351
No.

57:12.774 --> 57:14.677
Then what were you doing there?

57:16.040 --> 57:17.590
I gave them the kids.

57:24.645 --> 57:26.062
1965,

57:27.070 --> 57:29.120
I gave them 12 children.

57:29.465 --> 57:30.465
What for?

57:33.710 --> 57:35.600
As a gift.

57:35.760 --> 57:38.040
<i>Next Time...</i>

57:39.560 --> 57:41.750
A man who can't die
has nothing to fear.

57:42.008 --> 57:45.600
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.920
We need a cover story.
