03:49.717 --> 03:51.717
Mrs. Alsop's out!

03:51.967 --> 03:55.467
Mrs. Alsop's out!

05:40.964 --> 05:43.630
- Did you turn off the gas?
- What gas?

05:43.880 --> 05:48.172
- Which is her room?
- Er, this one.

05:57.630 --> 06:00.214
We must move her.
Where's the landlady?

06:00.464 --> 06:01.755
- Not home.
- Where's your room?

06:02.005 --> 06:03.047
Two floors up.

06:03.297 --> 06:06.297
Take her shoulders,
I'll take her feet.

06:06.547 --> 06:09.629
Come on, Miss.

06:17.046 --> 06:18.629
Pick up my bag.

06:18.879 --> 06:23.088
Sorry,
you'll have to do that yourself.

06:32.379 --> 06:35.296
Open the windows.
She needs lots of fresh air.

06:35.546 --> 06:38.421
So do I.

06:44.046 --> 06:45.713
- Shall I call an ambulance?
- No time.

06:45.962 --> 06:49.296
She needs an emetic first.
Glass of water, please.

06:49.545 --> 06:52.461
Here it is.

06:53.878 --> 06:56.711
I need 2 quarts of warm water
and some towels.

06:56.961 --> 07:00.253
Towels, coming up.

07:09.378 --> 07:11.461
You found this bottle
clutched in her hand?

07:11.711 --> 07:14.545
Certainly did, from your dispensary.

07:14.795 --> 07:17.878
I see.
How long have you known this girl?

07:18.128 --> 07:19.878
About five minutes.

07:20.128 --> 07:23.378
She'll need looking after
for a couple of days.

07:23.628 --> 07:27.045
- How about the ambulance?
- It isn't necessary now.

07:27.295 --> 07:29.128
She's out of danger.

07:29.377 --> 07:33.377
Besides, sending her to a hospital
would start an inquiry.

07:33.627 --> 07:36.044
And attempted suicide means jail.

07:36.294 --> 07:39.210
However, in a couple of days
she'll be fully recovered.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.544
Meanwhile, let her rest quietly.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.127
If she's thirsty
give her orange juice.

07:44.377 --> 07:46.294
And tomorrow,
if she has an appetite

07:46.544 --> 07:48.877
a little chicken broth,
but no tinned food.

07:49.127 --> 07:52.127
Now, if you'll be at my dispensary
in ten minutes

07:52.377 --> 07:53.710
I'll have a prescription for you.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.502
- For me?
- No. For her, of course.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.876
Headache?

08:28.126 --> 08:30.043
Where am I?

08:30.293 --> 08:33.376
In my room.
I live two floors above you.

08:33.626 --> 08:35.043
What happened?

08:35.293 --> 08:38.626
I came home this evening and
smelled gas coming from your room

08:38.876 --> 08:40.293
so I broke in the door,
called a doctor,

08:40.543 --> 08:43.458
and together we brought you here.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.459
Why didn't you let me die?

08:45.709 --> 08:47.543
What's your hurry?

08:47.793 --> 08:51.167
Are you in pain?

08:52.625 --> 08:57.458
That's all that matters.
The rest is fantasy.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.958
Billions of years it's taken
to evolve human consciousness

09:01.208 --> 09:02.958
and you want to wipe it out.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.292
Wipe out the miracle
of all existence.

09:06.542 --> 09:10.375
More important than anything
in the whole universe!

09:10.625 --> 09:12.708
What can the stars do?

09:12.958 --> 09:17.625
Nothing...
but sit on their axis!

09:19.292 --> 09:20.708
And the sun,

09:20.958 --> 09:24.375
shooting flames 280,000 miles high...

09:24.625 --> 09:27.042
So what?

09:27.292 --> 09:30.707
Wasting all its natural resources.

09:30.957 --> 09:34.124
Can the sun think? Is it conscious?

09:34.374 --> 09:37.791
No, but you are!

09:39.791 --> 09:43.124
Pardon me, my mistake.

09:54.291 --> 09:58.499
Here you are, and there you go!

09:59.207 --> 10:01.457
Well, bless me. Heavens alive!

10:01.707 --> 10:04.624
Look at that. Look at me door!

10:04.874 --> 10:06.957
House breaking, that's what it is!

10:07.207 --> 10:10.540
I suppose she's taken her things.
She'll go to jail for this.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.415
I knew she was no good.

10:12.665 --> 10:15.290
That quiet type.

10:15.540 --> 10:19.665
Still waters that run deep
usually stink!

10:26.790 --> 10:29.790
That's funny,
she hasn't taken a thing.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.706
And she won't, either.

10:31.956 --> 10:34.290
Not until she's paid 4 weeks rent.

10:34.540 --> 10:35.956
Smashing in a door!

10:36.206 --> 10:39.123
Nice festivities
going on behind my back!

10:39.373 --> 10:43.706
Well, she's out now
and she'll stay out!

10:54.872 --> 10:59.997
Mr. Calvero! Oh Mr. Calvero!

11:35.538 --> 11:38.288
Is that you, Mr. Calvero?

11:38.538 --> 11:41.788
Your laundry.
I was about to leave it on your bed.

11:42.038 --> 11:45.079
Just a moment!

11:49.788 --> 11:51.662
Hold it, hold it!

11:51.912 --> 11:54.787
Hold everything!

12:06.038 --> 12:09.411
You dropped these.

12:10.286 --> 12:13.120
And here's your oranges.

12:13.370 --> 12:16.036
Thank you.

12:37.453 --> 12:40.120
So this is
how she spends her evenings.

12:40.370 --> 12:42.870
You take your hands off me!

12:43.120 --> 12:44.620
What's she doing in your room?

12:44.870 --> 12:46.203
The opposite of what you think.

12:46.453 --> 12:49.202
I'd like to know
who smashed in the door downstairs.

12:49.452 --> 12:50.952
- I did.
- You did!

12:51.202 --> 12:52.452
You have a leaking gas pipe.

12:52.702 --> 12:54.119
I have a what?

12:54.369 --> 12:56.202
I mean that room
has a leaking gas pipe.

12:56.452 --> 12:58.535
There's something fishy about this.

12:58.785 --> 13:01.535
- Who is she anyway?
- You ought to know by now.

13:01.785 --> 13:04.202
Came six weeks ago.
Said she was a working girl.

13:04.452 --> 13:07.119
That's what they all say.
Why are you so interested?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.452
The girl tried to kill herself.

13:09.702 --> 13:13.119
Took poison, turned on the gas.
I came home just in time.

13:13.369 --> 13:15.952
I'll call the police
and get an ambulance.

13:16.202 --> 13:18.702
It'll be in all the papers.
You don't want that.

13:18.952 --> 13:20.619
She's not staying where she is.

13:20.869 --> 13:24.702
My good woman, I don't want her!
Let her go back to her room.

13:24.952 --> 13:27.119
I should say not.
Besides, it's rented.

13:27.369 --> 13:29.451
You can't throw her into the street!

13:29.701 --> 13:32.201
She's not going back
to her own room.

13:32.451 --> 13:33.784
Then she'll have to stay
where she is.

13:34.034 --> 13:36.451
What? And scandalize my household!

13:36.701 --> 13:39.451
We could be man and wife
for all anyone knows.

13:39.701 --> 13:42.534
Oh, could you?
Well, you'd better not be.

13:42.784 --> 13:44.951
You'd better get rid of her,
and quick.

13:45.201 --> 13:46.784
Man and wife!

13:47.034 --> 13:48.784
You watch out for that hussy.

13:49.034 --> 13:54.368
She's no good. And she's been sick
since she came here.

13:56.534 --> 14:00.159
It wouldn't be dandruff, would it?

16:03.698 --> 16:06.406
Ready?

17:06.529 --> 17:08.029
<i>I am an animal trainer</i>

17:08.279 --> 17:10.195
<i>A circus entertainer</i>

17:10.445 --> 17:13.945
<i>I train animals by the score
Lions, tigers and wild boar</i>

17:14.195 --> 17:17.695
<i>I've made and lost a fortune
In my wild career</i>

17:17.945 --> 17:23.363
<i>Some say the cause was women
Some say it was beer</i>

17:23.945 --> 17:27.445
<i>Then I went through bankruptcy
And lost my whole menagerie</i>

17:27.695 --> 17:31.028
<i>But I did not despair
I got a bright idea</i>

17:31.278 --> 17:33.028
<i>While searching
through my underwear</i>

17:33.278 --> 17:34.861
<i>A thought occurred to me</i>

17:35.111 --> 17:40.528
<i>I'm tired of training elephants
So why not train a flea</i>

17:40.778 --> 17:44.528
<i>Why should I hunt for animals
And through the jungle roam</i>

17:44.778 --> 17:50.361
<i>When there's local talent
to be found right here at home</i>

17:50.611 --> 17:53.278
<i>I found one but I won't say where</i>

17:53.528 --> 17:56.195
<i>And educated him with care</i>

17:56.445 --> 17:59.028
<i>And taught him
all the facts of life</i>

17:59.278 --> 18:01.945
<i>And then he found himself a wife</i>

18:02.195 --> 18:04.861
<i>I give them board and lodging free</i>

18:05.111 --> 18:07.611
<i>And every night they dine off me</i>

18:07.861 --> 18:10.444
<i>They don't eat caviar or cake</i>

18:10.694 --> 18:13.194
<i>But they enjoy a good rump steak</i>

18:13.444 --> 18:17.194
<i>Off my anatomy
Off my anatomy</i>

18:17.444 --> 18:19.194
<i>It is an odd sensation</i>

18:19.444 --> 18:24.944
<i>When after meals they take a stroll
Around the old plantation</i>

18:25.194 --> 18:27.610
<i>Now I'm as happy as can be</i>

18:27.860 --> 18:30.527
<i>I've taught them lots of tricks
you see</i>

18:30.777 --> 18:36.360
<i>And now they're both supporting me
They're both supporting me</i>

18:36.860 --> 18:40.194
<i>So walk up, walk up
I've the greatest show on earth</i>

18:40.444 --> 18:44.110
<i>Walk up, walk up
And get your money's worth</i>

18:44.360 --> 18:47.860
<i>See Phyllis and Henry
Those educated fleas</i>

18:48.109 --> 18:51.526
<i>Cavorting and sporting
On the flying trapeze</i>

18:51.776 --> 18:55.109
<i>So any time you itch
Don't scratch or make a fuss</i>

18:55.359 --> 19:00.693
<i>You never can tell you might destroy
Some budding genius</i>

19:17.526 --> 19:19.526
Phyllis! Henry! Stop that!

19:19.776 --> 19:21.776
What do you think you're doing?

19:22.026 --> 19:26.526
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, fighting like that!

19:26.776 --> 19:30.858
Alright. Phyllis, stay in the box!
Henry!

20:08.357 --> 20:11.524
You should have done that
before I opened the box.

20:11.774 --> 20:14.982
Do you hear? Come on!

20:32.357 --> 20:35.732
Do you want me to squeeze?

21:09.356 --> 21:11.356
Stop that now!

21:11.606 --> 21:13.190
Come up from there!

21:13.440 --> 21:17.273
Phyllis, you hear?
Remember you're on a diet.

21:17.523 --> 21:21.898
Phyllis, have you gone mad?

21:23.940 --> 21:27.605
Stop that, do you hear? Stop it!

21:29.439 --> 21:33.189
Phyllis, do you hear?
Come up at once! You go too far!

21:33.439 --> 21:37.647
Phyllis, what are you doing?

21:37.772 --> 21:39.689
Crazy little creature!

21:39.939 --> 21:42.772
Phyllis, Henry wants you.

21:43.022 --> 21:44.939
Come, Phyllis.

21:45.189 --> 21:47.939
Phyllis, stop that.

21:51.855 --> 21:54.355
Phyllis, come out here!
Come out!

21:54.605 --> 21:58.564
Where do you think you're going?
You nitwit!

21:58.605 --> 22:01.564
Phyllis! Stop that now!

22:01.689 --> 22:05.022
Do you want me to scratch?

22:09.438 --> 22:11.896
That's not Phyllis.

22:12.146 --> 22:13.688
Where's Phyllis?

22:13.938 --> 22:17.146
Oh, there she is!

23:33.435 --> 23:36.519
Are you awake?

23:37.935 --> 23:40.935
Your husband said to look in on you.

23:41.185 --> 23:43.852
- Who?
- Your husband.

23:44.102 --> 23:47.102
He said to warm up
some chicken soup for you.

23:47.352 --> 23:49.852
Husband?

23:50.102 --> 23:51.935
Let me help you. Come on.

23:52.185 --> 23:54.519
You haven't eaten a thing all day.

23:54.769 --> 23:56.602
A nice warm soup will do you good.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.519
Thank you, no.

24:09.102 --> 24:10.185
Your wife won't eat.

24:10.434 --> 24:14.726
Well, that's a blessing
to a poor married man.

24:27.018 --> 24:29.768
How do you feel?

24:29.851 --> 24:31.101
Much better, thank you.

24:31.351 --> 24:32.684
Good.

24:32.934 --> 24:34.851
Pay no attention
to this wife business.

24:35.101 --> 24:40.059
It's a front of respectability
for the new housemaid.

24:40.434 --> 24:44.101
However, as soon as you get well
you'll be free and divorced.

24:44.351 --> 24:45.851
I think I'm well enough now.

24:46.101 --> 24:50.184
Not quite. I think
you'd better stay another day or so.

24:50.433 --> 24:52.433
You're very kind.

24:52.683 --> 24:56.600
I think I'm able to get back
to my room now.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.683
I'm afraid that isn't possible.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.183
Why?

25:01.433 --> 25:05.975
Mrs. Alsop's rented it.
The people are moving in today.

25:06.183 --> 25:08.100
Oh, I see.

25:08.350 --> 25:13.433
However you're welcome to stay here
until you know what you want to do.

25:13.683 --> 25:17.183
What can I do? I'm helpless.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.350
Why didn't you let me die
and get it over with!

25:23.600 --> 25:27.017
That's no way to talk. You're alive
and you better make the most of it.

25:27.267 --> 25:29.350
I'm destitute. Ill.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.599
Listen...

25:31.849 --> 25:34.516
I don't know what's wrong with you,

25:34.766 --> 25:38.099
but if you're ill,
and if it's what Mrs. Alsop thinks,

25:38.349 --> 25:41.432
you should do something about it.
It isn't hopeless.

25:41.682 --> 25:44.599
If it's, uh...

25:45.099 --> 25:46.849
You know what I'm talking about.

25:47.099 --> 25:49.182
I don't think I do.

25:49.432 --> 25:51.182
Well, let me put it this way.

25:51.432 --> 25:56.016
A young girl, alone,
thrown into the world, gets ill.

25:56.266 --> 25:58.682
If it's anything like that,
you can be cured.

25:58.932 --> 26:03.682
There's a new drug performing
miracles, curing thousands.

26:03.932 --> 26:06.099
If it's anything of that nature
don't be afraid to tell,

26:06.349 --> 26:08.016
maybe I can help.

26:08.266 --> 26:12.098
I'm an old sinner,
nothing shocks me.

26:14.098 --> 26:15.765
It's nothing like that.

26:16.015 --> 26:18.098
Are you sure?

26:18.348 --> 26:19.265
Positive.

26:19.515 --> 26:20.848
But you have been ill?

26:21.098 --> 26:25.431
Yes. I was five months
in the hospital with rheumatic fever.

26:25.681 --> 26:28.181
Is that all?
Then what are you complaining about?

26:28.431 --> 26:30.348
It's ruined my health.
I can't work.

26:30.598 --> 26:32.181
What do you work at?

26:32.431 --> 26:34.931
I was a dancer.

26:35.181 --> 26:36.431
A dancer!

26:36.681 --> 26:39.848
A member of the Empire ballet.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.598
And I thought you were a...

26:42.848 --> 26:45.515
So, you're a ballet dancer.

26:45.765 --> 26:49.431
Pardon me, we haven't met formally.
What is your name?

26:49.681 --> 26:53.180
Thereza Ambrose.
But I'm called Terry.

26:53.430 --> 26:57.264
Charming. How do you do.
I'm also in the business.

26:57.514 --> 27:00.847
My name is Calvero.
Perhaps you've heard of me.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.847
You're not the great comedian?

27:03.097 --> 27:06.014
I was.
However, we won't go into that.

27:06.264 --> 27:09.014
Whatever brought you
to this state of affairs?

27:09.264 --> 27:10.764
Ill health, mostly.

27:11.014 --> 27:13.930
Then we'll have to get you well.

27:14.180 --> 27:17.180
It isn't the ideal spot
for convalescing,

27:17.430 --> 27:19.514
but you're welcome to it,

27:19.764 --> 27:24.014
if you can put up with being
Mrs. Calvero. In name only!

27:24.264 --> 27:25.597
It won't inconvenience you?

27:25.847 --> 27:28.180
Not at all.
I've had five wives already.

27:28.430 --> 27:30.096
One more or less
makes no difference.

27:30.346 --> 27:32.096
Moreover, I've arrived at the age

27:32.346 --> 27:38.179
where platonic friendship can be
sustained on the highest moral plane.

27:42.179 --> 27:47.513
Now let me see, your mother was
a dressmaker and your father a lord?

27:47.763 --> 27:51.596
The fourth son of a lord.
That's quite different.

27:52.929 --> 27:54.513
How is it he married your mother?

27:54.763 --> 27:56.846
She was
one of the family housemaids.

27:57.096 --> 27:59.012
Sounds like a novelette.

27:59.262 --> 28:02.929
- Did he have any money?
- No, the family cut him off.

28:03.179 --> 28:05.429
So your sister's
the only one living?

28:05.679 --> 28:09.096
Yes, and she's in South America.

28:09.928 --> 28:14.511
Tell me, was it just ill health
that made you do what you did?

28:14.761 --> 28:18.303
- That, and...
- And what?

28:19.428 --> 28:22.678
The utter futility of everything.

28:22.928 --> 28:25.845
I see it even in flowers,

28:26.095 --> 28:28.678
hear it in music.

28:28.928 --> 28:31.761
All life aimless,
without meaning.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.345
What do you want a meaning for?

28:34.595 --> 28:37.095
Life is a desire, not a meaning.

28:37.345 --> 28:39.761
Desire is the theme of all life!

28:40.011 --> 28:44.428
It makes a rose want to be a rose,
and want to grow like that.

28:44.678 --> 28:49.720
And a rock want to contain itself
and remain like that.

28:51.677 --> 28:53.427
What are you smiling about?

28:53.677 --> 28:57.094
Your imitation
of a rose and a rock.

28:58.260 --> 28:59.510
I can imitate anything.

28:59.760 --> 29:04.760
Ever seen a Japanese tree?
They're lopsided, they grow this way.

29:07.344 --> 29:10.885
Of course pansies grow this way.

29:11.260 --> 29:14.885
The dark ones frown and go like that.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.427
However, the meaning of anything

29:19.677 --> 29:22.344
is merely other words
for the same thing.

29:22.594 --> 29:28.135
After all, a rose is a rose.
Not bad, should be quoted.

29:30.176 --> 29:33.009
Think how meaningless
life was a moment ago.

29:33.259 --> 29:37.093
Now you have
a temporary husband and a home.

29:37.343 --> 29:42.176
Here's your drinking water,
and in case of any emergencies,

29:42.426 --> 29:47.426
the first door on the left,
the same on each floor.

29:48.009 --> 29:50.801
Good night.

30:38.842 --> 30:41.842
<i>Spring is here!</i>

30:42.092 --> 30:45.175
<i>Birds are calling</i>

30:45.425 --> 30:47.842
<i>Skunks are crawling</i>

30:48.092 --> 30:54.132
<i>Wagging their tails for love</i>

30:54.674 --> 30:57.507
<i>Spring is here!</i>

30:57.757 --> 31:00.841
<i>Whales are churning</i>

31:01.091 --> 31:03.757
<i>Worms are squirming</i>

31:04.007 --> 31:09.174
<i>Wagging their tails for love</i>

31:09.424 --> 31:12.007
<i>What is this thing
Of which I sing</i>

31:12.257 --> 31:13.924
<i>That makes us all bewitched?</i>

31:14.174 --> 31:17.257
<i>What is this thing
That comes in Spring</i>

31:17.507 --> 31:21.091
<i>That gives us all the itch?</i>

31:21.507 --> 31:23.174
<i>Oh, it's love</i>

31:23.424 --> 31:27.507
<i>It's love,
It's love love love love</i>

32:07.506 --> 32:10.755
Pardon me,
but have you a fly swatter?

32:11.005 --> 32:12.755
I beg your pardon.

32:13.005 --> 32:15.005
If you beg around here,
I'll call the police.

32:15.255 --> 32:17.172
I repeat, I beg your pardon.

32:17.422 --> 32:18.922
I don't care what you've eaten.

32:19.172 --> 32:19.922
I've eaten nothing.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.339
Poor dear.
Here, get a sandwich.

32:22.589 --> 32:25.339
- Sir, I demand an apology!
- I don't know you.

32:25.589 --> 32:27.839
Who are your people?
Are you in the social register?

32:28.089 --> 32:31.255
- My name happens to be Smith.
- Never heard of them.

32:31.505 --> 32:33.589
That shows you're asinine.

32:33.839 --> 32:35.339
I should have worn my overcoat.

32:35.589 --> 32:37.589
You've interrupted me
in the middle of my sonnet.

32:37.839 --> 32:39.005
In the middle of your what?

32:39.255 --> 32:41.755
Not in the middle of my what,
the middle of my sonnet.

32:42.005 --> 32:44.839
My ode to a worm.

32:45.089 --> 32:48.255
Oh worm, why do you turn
into the earth from me?

32:48.505 --> 32:49.921
'Tis Spring! Oh worm!

32:50.171 --> 32:51.754
Lift up your head

32:52.004 --> 32:54.838
whichever end that be
and smile at the sun

32:55.088 --> 32:58.171
untwine your naked form
and with your tail, fling!

32:58.421 --> 33:00.004
High the dirt in ecstasy!

33:00.254 --> 33:05.921
'Tis Spring! 'Tis Spring!
'Tis Spring!

33:06.838 --> 33:09.504
Ridiculous!
A worm smiling at the sun!

33:09.754 --> 33:12.088
- Why not?
- A worm can't smile.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.171
Did you ever appeal
to its sense of humor?

33:14.421 --> 33:15.587
- Of course not.
- Well then!

33:15.837 --> 33:18.338
But it doesn't make sense.

33:18.588 --> 33:20.921
Why should poetry
have to make sense?

33:21.171 --> 33:24.421
Don't you know there's such a thing
as poetic license?

33:24.671 --> 33:26.754
I've given you no license.

33:27.004 --> 33:28.087
Oh no, don't!

33:28.337 --> 33:30.753
This thing is so much bigger
than ourselves!

33:31.003 --> 33:34.920
At this moment
I'm grasping the meaning of life.

33:35.170 --> 33:37.086
What a waste of energy.

33:37.336 --> 33:40.836
What is this urge
that makes life go on and on?

33:41.086 --> 33:44.503
You're right.
What does it all mean?

33:44.753 --> 33:45.836
Where are we going?

33:46.086 --> 33:49.086
You're going south.
Your hand's in my pocket.

33:49.336 --> 33:50.253
Naughty.

33:50.503 --> 33:56.045
- How did it get there?
- Pure magnetism, old dear.

33:58.086 --> 34:01.170
Why are you antagonistic
towards me?

34:01.420 --> 34:03.003
Must we be serious?

34:03.253 --> 34:05.170
You make it difficult to know you.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.003
Read my memoirs
in the Police Gazette.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.668
- You're a funny man.
- Why?

34:09.918 --> 34:11.835
To talk about worms
the way you do.

34:12.085 --> 34:15.335
Why not? Even flies are romantic.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.335
- Flies?
- Oh yes.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.835
Coming from the stable
to the table,

34:20.085 --> 34:24.335
chasing each other over the sugar
and meeting in the butter.

34:24.585 --> 34:27.085
- You've read "The Life of the Bee"?
- No, I haven't.

34:27.335 --> 34:30.335
The bee's behavior in the beehive
is unbelievable.

34:30.585 --> 34:32.252
Really?

34:32.502 --> 34:34.335
- Gezundheit!
- It certainly does.

34:34.585 --> 34:37.668
- I beg your pardon?
- The dress. It goes on tight.

34:37.918 --> 34:41.418
You're awful dusty tonight, my dear.
Turn around.

34:41.668 --> 34:46.252
Where do they keep you?
On the top shelf or something?

34:46.335 --> 34:50.001
Fuller's earth? Johnson's powder?
I know! Cornstarch.

34:50.251 --> 34:54.251
Just think!
All life motivated by love.

34:54.501 --> 34:55.668
How beautiful.

34:55.918 --> 34:57.584
- By no means beautiful.
- It certainly is.

34:57.834 --> 35:01.001
No, it's vile, wicked, awful!
But wonderful.

35:01.251 --> 35:03.334
- I like you.
- Really?

35:03.584 --> 35:05.918
You're sensitive. You feel things.

35:06.168 --> 35:07.334
Don't encourage me.

35:07.584 --> 35:11.834
It's true. So few people
have the capacity to feel.

35:12.084 --> 35:15.168
Or the opportunity.

35:17.334 --> 35:18.834
Allow me.

35:19.084 --> 35:22.751
Use it only for what you wish.

35:47.917 --> 35:50.708
Come in.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.250
Good morning. How do you feel?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.333
- Better, thank you.
- Good.

35:56.583 --> 35:58.250
What a day!

35:58.500 --> 36:03.000
The sun's shining, the kettle's
singing, and we've paid the rent.

36:03.250 --> 36:07.083
There'll be an earthquake,
I know it.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.916
What would you like for breakfast?

36:09.166 --> 36:13.666
We have eggs, bacon,
cheese, spring onions...

36:13.916 --> 36:15.416
That's broken my dream!

36:15.666 --> 36:18.666
I dreamt we did an act together,
all about Spring.

36:18.916 --> 36:19.832
Interesting.

36:20.082 --> 36:24.041
I get lots of ideas in my dreams,
then I wake up and forget them.

36:24.291 --> 36:28.082
You know, I've been dreaming a lot
about the theater lately.

36:28.332 --> 36:31.999
Doing my old acts all over again.

36:33.999 --> 36:38.082
Kippers. Aren't they superb!

36:40.999 --> 36:43.541
What's wrong?

36:43.999 --> 36:47.666
It's my legs! I tried to get up
this morning and I collapsed.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.415
I can't even stand.

36:50.665 --> 36:51.915
You got up too soon.

36:52.165 --> 36:55.748
No, it's not that.
I have no feeling in them.

36:55.998 --> 36:59.331
They're paralyzed. I know it!

36:59.581 --> 37:02.748
Don't upset yourself.
After breakfast we'll call the doctor.

37:02.998 --> 37:04.498
I'd better go to a hospital.

37:04.748 --> 37:07.165
You know best,
but see what the doctor says first.

37:07.415 --> 37:09.748
I can't stay here,
causing you all this trouble.

37:09.998 --> 37:11.498
I'm not complaining.

37:11.748 --> 37:14.831
You should, I'm such a bore.

37:15.081 --> 37:18.456
But it's not my fault.
You would save my life.

37:18.706 --> 37:22.081
Well, we all make mistakes!

37:22.498 --> 37:24.415
I'm sorry.

37:24.665 --> 37:30.580
You should be. A young girl like you
wanting to throw your life away.

37:30.830 --> 37:33.997
When you're my age,
you'll want to hang on to it.

37:34.247 --> 37:35.497
Why?

37:35.747 --> 37:39.497
Well, at this stage of the game
life gets to be a habit.

37:39.747 --> 37:41.164
A hopeless one.

37:41.414 --> 37:44.914
Then live without hope.
Live for the moment.

37:45.164 --> 37:47.622
There are still, there are still...

37:47.872 --> 37:49.414
There are still wonderful moments.

37:49.664 --> 37:50.997
But if you've lost your health!

37:51.247 --> 37:55.955
My dear, I was given up for dead
six months ago, but I fought back.

37:56.205 --> 37:58.164
That's what you must do.

37:58.414 --> 38:00.664
I'm tired of fighting.

38:00.914 --> 38:05.997
Because you're fighting yourself.
You won't give yourself a chance.

38:06.247 --> 38:08.829
But the fight for happiness
is beautiful.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.079
Happiness...

38:10.329 --> 38:13.413
- There is such a thing.
- Where?

38:13.663 --> 38:18.121
Listen, as a child I used to complain
to my father about not having toys

38:18.371 --> 38:23.663
and he would say "this"
is the greatest toy ever created.

38:23.913 --> 38:27.496
Here lies
the secret of all happiness.

38:27.746 --> 38:30.996
To hear you talk, no one would
ever think you were a comedian.

38:31.246 --> 38:37.163
I'm beginning to realize that.
It's the reason I can't get a job.

38:37.746 --> 38:40.454
Why?

38:40.829 --> 38:43.121
Because they have no imagination.

38:43.371 --> 38:47.871
Or think because I'm getting
on in years I'm old, all washed up.

38:48.038 --> 38:52.578
Never! After hearing you talk.

38:52.828 --> 38:54.995
Perhaps I drank too much.

38:55.245 --> 38:58.495
There's usually a reason
for drinking.

38:59.161 --> 39:02.495
Unhappiness, I suppose.

39:02.828 --> 39:06.286
No, I'm used to that.

39:06.911 --> 39:10.453
It was more complicated.

39:10.703 --> 39:14.995
As a man gets on in years
he wants to live deeply.

39:15.245 --> 39:20.161
A feeling of sad dignity comes upon
him, and that's fatal for a comic.

39:20.411 --> 39:21.828
It affected my work.

39:22.078 --> 39:25.995
I lost contact with the audience,
couldn't warm up to them.

39:26.245 --> 39:28.494
And that's what started me drinking.

39:28.744 --> 39:30.577
I had to have it before I went on.

39:30.827 --> 39:34.744
It got so I couldn't be funny
without it. The more I drank...

39:34.994 --> 39:36.994
It became a vicious circle.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.244
What happened?

39:38.494 --> 39:41.160
A heart attack. I almost died.

39:41.410 --> 39:43.244
And you're still drinking?

39:43.494 --> 39:45.994
Occasionally, if I think of things.

39:46.244 --> 39:49.827
The wrong things I suppose,
as you do.

39:50.077 --> 39:52.619
What would you like
for your breakfast?

39:52.869 --> 39:56.160
What a sad business, being funny.

39:56.410 --> 39:59.160
Very sad if they won't laugh.

39:59.410 --> 40:00.952
But it's a thrill when they do.

40:01.202 --> 40:04.744
To look out there
and see them all laughing,

40:04.994 --> 40:08.493
to hear that roar go up,
waves of laughter coming at you.

40:08.743 --> 40:11.076
Let's talk of something
more cheerful.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.409
Besides I want to forget the public.

40:14.659 --> 40:16.409
Never. You love them too much.

40:16.659 --> 40:19.159
Maybe I love them,
but I don't admire them.

40:19.409 --> 40:20.826
I think you do.

40:21.076 --> 40:24.326
As individuals, yes.
There's greatness in everyone.

40:24.576 --> 40:27.659
But as a crowd, they're like
a monster without a head

40:27.909 --> 40:30.993
that never knows which way
it's going to turn.

40:31.243 --> 40:33.993
It can be prodded in any direction.

40:34.243 --> 40:39.784
I keep forgetting about breakfast.
How about some poached eggs?

40:40.034 --> 40:42.576
Come in.

40:43.409 --> 40:47.076
- A telegram.
- Oh, thank you.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.367
Are you all right?

41:01.617 --> 41:04.242
This is what I've been waiting for.

41:04.492 --> 41:06.658
Good news?

41:06.908 --> 41:09.325
Redfern, my agent, wants to see me.

41:09.575 --> 41:11.408
Wonderful!

41:11.658 --> 41:14.908
You're right.
This is the turning point.

41:15.158 --> 41:18.492
Those managers have been holding
out on me, breaking my morale.

41:18.742 --> 41:21.075
But now they want me!

41:21.325 --> 41:26.492
And now I'll make them pay!
For their contempt and indifference.

41:26.742 --> 41:28.657
No, I'll be gracious.

41:28.907 --> 41:31.574
That'll be more dignified,
put them in their place.

41:31.824 --> 41:33.324
I'm to be at Redfern's office
at three.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.032
I'll call the doctor
and tell him about your legs.

41:36.282 --> 41:39.074
But I forgot your breakfast!

41:39.324 --> 41:42.657
How about some nice kippers?

41:59.449 --> 42:03.449
Nothing for you, or you, or you...

42:04.157 --> 42:07.032
Nothing for you.

42:15.323 --> 42:17.240
- Anyone waiting?
- Miss Parker.

42:17.490 --> 42:18.323
Anyone else?

42:18.573 --> 42:21.490
Yes, Calvero.
He's been here since three.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.615
I forgot all about him.
Show him in.

42:30.156 --> 42:33.031
Good afternoon, Calvero.
Sit down.

42:33.281 --> 42:38.073
Sorry about yesterday. I was held up
over some important business.

42:38.323 --> 42:40.073
However, I've good news for you.

42:40.323 --> 42:42.573
I can get you a week
at Middlesex Music Hall.

42:42.823 --> 42:44.240
At what terms?

42:44.490 --> 42:46.906
I don't know yet,
but I wouldn't bother about that.

42:47.156 --> 42:49.072
No bother at all.

42:49.322 --> 42:52.155
However, if money's no object,

42:52.405 --> 42:55.655
- what billing am I to get?
- I wouldn't bother about that either.

42:55.905 --> 42:58.489
I'm not to get star billing
at Middlesex?

42:58.739 --> 43:00.405
I'm not sure
we can book you there.

43:00.655 --> 43:03.322
You think I'd allow those managers
to throw in my name

43:03.572 --> 43:07.822
with a lot of nondescripts
just to build up their reputation!

43:08.072 --> 43:10.405
Calvero's still a name
to conjure with!

43:10.655 --> 43:13.572
You're mistaken.
Today it means nothing.

43:13.822 --> 43:15.072
Then why do they want me?

43:15.322 --> 43:18.489
They don't want you.
They're doing me a favor.

43:18.739 --> 43:22.655
Very kind of them.
I hope you appreciate the fact.

43:22.905 --> 43:25.239
I'm going to be perfectly frank
with you.

43:25.489 --> 43:28.988
I've been talking Calvero
to them for over six months.

43:29.238 --> 43:32.154
Your name is poison.
They don't want to touch you.

43:32.404 --> 43:35.571
They couldn't if they tried.

43:36.321 --> 43:41.404
I'm sorry, but you must
be made to realize the facts.

43:41.779 --> 43:44.738
You're succeeding splendidly.

43:44.988 --> 43:49.821
I'm trying to help, that's all.
But you must cooperate.

43:51.821 --> 43:53.738
Whatever you say, I'll do.

43:53.988 --> 43:55.238
That's the spirit.

43:55.488 --> 44:00.113
As soon as the contract's confirmed,
I'll let you know.

44:04.654 --> 44:08.111
However, cheer up.

44:08.320 --> 44:12.236
If my name is poison to them,
I won't use it.

44:12.486 --> 44:17.278
- I'll go by another name.
- I think that's a splendid idea.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.945
Well doctor, how is our patient?

44:29.195 --> 44:33.736
The condition is cleared up, but
I find nothing wrong with her legs.

44:33.986 --> 44:35.820
Didn't she tell you
she's had rheumatic fever?

44:36.070 --> 44:37.528
Yes, but I don't think she has.

44:37.778 --> 44:40.820
The heart would have been affected
and it's perfectly sound.

44:41.070 --> 44:43.403
I believe it's a case
of psycho-anesthesia.

44:43.653 --> 44:45.153
What's that?

44:45.403 --> 44:48.569
A form of hysteria that has
the characteristics of paralysis

44:48.819 --> 44:50.152
without being so.

44:50.402 --> 44:51.569
How do you account for it?

44:51.819 --> 44:54.902
In her case, I'd say
it's psychological, self-imposed.

44:55.152 --> 44:58.985
Having failed at suicide,
she's decided to become a cripple.

44:59.235 --> 45:00.694
Is there any way I can help?

45:00.944 --> 45:05.069
Primarily she must help herself.
It's a case for a psychologist.

45:05.319 --> 45:07.319
Doctor Freud.

45:07.569 --> 45:09.902
Well, I'll see what I can do.

45:10.152 --> 45:13.319
- Good day, Doctor.
- Good day.

45:17.319 --> 45:20.652
Tell me more
about your sister Louise.

45:20.902 --> 45:23.360
There's nothing more to tell.

45:23.610 --> 45:27.402
When she couldn't find work
she was driven to the street.

45:27.652 --> 45:29.859
How old were you
when you discovered this?

45:30.109 --> 45:32.818
About eight.

45:33.068 --> 45:34.818
Tell me about it.

45:35.068 --> 45:38.443
It was after my mother died.
I loved Louise.

45:38.693 --> 45:42.359
She was everything to me,
supported me, had me taught dancing.

45:42.609 --> 45:45.484
Then one day I realized
what she was doing.

45:45.734 --> 45:47.901
I was coming home from dancing
with the other girls

45:48.151 --> 45:53.234
and I saw her, and the other girls
saw her, walking the street.

45:53.484 --> 45:55.901
What did you do?

45:56.151 --> 45:58.401
I just ran and wept.

45:58.651 --> 46:01.151
Ran and wept.

46:01.401 --> 46:03.193
Then what happened?

46:03.443 --> 46:05.234
I tried to forget.

46:05.484 --> 46:09.817
I was sent to boarding school. At 16,
I left and joined the Empire Ballet.

46:10.067 --> 46:14.817
Louise went to South America.
I haven't heard from her since.

46:15.317 --> 46:18.650
Up to that time,
you had no trouble with your legs?

46:18.900 --> 46:20.733
No.

46:20.983 --> 46:22.317
When did it start?

46:22.567 --> 46:27.150
About two years later.
After Melise joined the ballet.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.233
Who's Melise?

46:28.483 --> 46:30.983
One of the girls
from the dancing school.

46:31.233 --> 46:35.192
One who was with you
when you found out about Louise?

46:36.983 --> 46:39.733
Mr. Freud would say
that since meeting this girl again,

46:39.983 --> 46:41.817
you don't want to dance.

46:42.067 --> 46:43.400
Why?

46:43.650 --> 46:46.233
You've associated it
with the unhappy life of your sister

46:46.483 --> 46:49.899
who paid for your lessons
through a life of shame.

46:50.149 --> 46:52.482
You've been ashamed to dance
ever since.

46:52.732 --> 46:55.066
I'd despise myself
if I thought that.

46:55.316 --> 46:56.982
That's the trouble, you do.

46:57.232 --> 47:02.149
That's the trouble with the world.
We all despise ourselves.

47:03.482 --> 47:06.524
Streetwalking!

47:07.066 --> 47:10.816
We're all grubbing for a living,
the best of us.

47:11.066 --> 47:14.649
All a part of the human crusade,

47:14.899 --> 47:16.982
written in water.

47:17.232 --> 47:19.066
But enough of that.

47:19.316 --> 47:20.982
Ever been in love?

47:21.232 --> 47:23.316
No, not really.

47:23.566 --> 47:25.649
I think it was more
a feeling of pity.

47:25.899 --> 47:29.148
The plot thickens.
Tell me about it.

47:29.398 --> 47:33.565
It's a ridiculous story.
I hardly knew the man.

47:33.815 --> 47:36.231
It was something I built up
in my own mind.

47:36.481 --> 47:39.648
<i>It was after I came out
of the hospital.</i>

47:39.898 --> 47:43.398
<i>I took a job
at Sardou's stationary shop.</i>

47:43.648 --> 47:48.231
<i>He was one of the customers,
a young American.</i>

47:48.481 --> 47:50.148
<i>He used to buy music paper</i>

47:50.398 --> 47:53.731
<i>in large and small amounts,
according to his finances.</i>

47:53.981 --> 47:58.648
<i>He seemed so lonely,
so helpless and shy.</i>

47:58.898 --> 48:01.315
<i>There was something pathetic
about him.</i>

48:01.565 --> 48:05.065
<i>I wouldn't have noticed him,
but someone tried to elbow in.</i>

48:05.315 --> 48:09.647
<i>When I ignored the other man,
he smiled in gratitude.</i>

48:09.897 --> 48:13.397
<i>The old charwoman who worked where
he lived told me he was Mr. Neville,</i>

48:13.647 --> 48:17.230
<i>a composer,
and that he occupied the top room.</i>

48:17.480 --> 48:20.814
<i>There were days I knew he went
without food to buy music paper.</i>

48:21.064 --> 48:22.814
<i>I could see it in his eyes.</i>

48:23.064 --> 48:24.980
<i>The haggard look.</i>

48:25.230 --> 48:26.980
<i>Sometimes I'd throw in
a few extra sheets.</i>

48:27.230 --> 48:29.564
<i>Once I gave him more
than his proper change,</i>

48:29.814 --> 48:32.480
<i>which he might have noticed,
but I wasn't sure.</i>

48:32.730 --> 48:37.480
<i>Often after work I'd stroll by his
house and hear him playing piano,</i>

48:37.730 --> 48:41.314
<i>repeating musical passages
over and over again.</i>

48:41.564 --> 48:47.147
<i>And I'd stand listening,
excited and melancholy.</i>

49:07.896 --> 49:11.812
Well, what then?

49:14.729 --> 49:17.729
Then for weeks I never saw him.

49:17.979 --> 49:22.646
The charwoman told me he was ill.
Creditors had taken his piano.

49:22.896 --> 49:26.896
<i>Eventually he came into the shop
looking very pale</i>

49:27.146 --> 49:30.228
<i>and asked for two shillings worth
of large orchestral sheets,</i>

49:30.478 --> 49:33.478
<i>placing a two shilling piece
on the counter.</i>

49:33.728 --> 49:36.311
<i>I knew it was his last.</i>

49:36.561 --> 49:40.061
<i>If I could only help him!
If I only dared!</i>

49:40.311 --> 49:44.395
<i>I could lend him money.
I wanted to tell him so.</i>

49:44.645 --> 49:47.395
<i>But I was also shy.</i>

49:47.645 --> 49:50.478
<i>Nevertheless
I was determined to help.</i>

49:50.728 --> 49:54.228
<i>I gave him some extra sheets
and as he was about leave</i>

49:54.478 --> 49:55.645
<i>I called him back:</i>

49:55.895 --> 49:57.895
<i>You've forgotten your change.</i>

49:58.145 --> 50:00.061
<i>There must be a mistake, he said.</i>

50:00.311 --> 50:01.645
<i>Not at all, I answered.</i>

50:01.895 --> 50:05.145
<i>You gave me half a crown,
here's sixpence change.</i>

50:05.395 --> 50:08.727
<i>Then I realized I had created
a ridiculous situation.</i>

50:08.977 --> 50:11.894
<i>To make matters worse
in came Mr. Sardou:</i>

50:12.144 --> 50:14.060
<i>Can I be of any assistance?</i>

50:14.310 --> 50:16.060
<i>It isn't necessary, I said quickly.</i>

50:16.310 --> 50:19.310
<i>The gentleman gave me half a crown
and forgot his change.</i>

50:19.560 --> 50:22.310
<i>However,
Mr. Sardou made him take it.</i>

50:22.560 --> 50:25.644
<i>But as soon as he left
Mr. Sardou went through the till</i>

50:25.894 --> 50:28.810
<i>and finding no half crown there,
became suspicious.</i>

50:29.060 --> 50:32.394
The discrepancy was discovered
and I was discharged.

50:32.644 --> 50:33.644
What did you do then?

50:33.894 --> 50:38.977
I tried to get back to dancing,
then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.

50:39.227 --> 50:41.810
Did you ever see
this young composer again?

50:42.060 --> 50:46.144
Yes, five months later.
After I came out of the hospital.

50:46.394 --> 50:48.643
I saw him from the gallery
of the Albert Hall.

50:48.893 --> 50:52.143
His symphony was played there.
It was a great success.

50:52.393 --> 50:54.809
Of course you're in love with him.

50:55.059 --> 50:56.393
I don't even know him.

50:56.643 --> 51:00.059
You will.
Life is a local affair.

51:00.309 --> 51:02.809
I can see it happening.

51:03.059 --> 51:06.226
You'll be at the height
of your success and he'll call on you,

51:06.476 --> 51:08.976
and tell you he met you
at some super party.

51:09.226 --> 51:10.476
Won't I recognize him?

51:10.726 --> 51:15.393
Oh no. He's grown a beard.
Musicians do.

51:15.893 --> 51:19.476
He'll tell you
he's composed a ballet for you.

51:19.726 --> 51:23.226
And you'll realize who he is,
you'll tell him who you are

51:23.476 --> 51:26.809
and how you met,
and how you waited on him.

51:27.058 --> 51:29.892
And gave him extra music sheets.

51:30.142 --> 51:34.308
And that night you'll dine together

51:34.558 --> 51:39.142
on a balcony
overlooking the Thames.

51:39.392 --> 51:41.392
It'll be summer.

51:41.642 --> 51:44.725
And you'll be wearing
pink mousseline.

51:44.975 --> 51:48.808
And he'll be conscious
of its fragrance.

51:49.058 --> 51:53.308
And all London
will be dreamy and beautiful.

51:53.558 --> 51:56.725
And in the elegant melancholy
of twilight,

51:56.975 --> 52:00.725
as the candles flutter
and make your eyes dance,

52:00.975 --> 52:03.308
he will tell you he loves you.

52:03.558 --> 52:08.057
And you will tell him
you have always loved him.

52:09.391 --> 52:12.349
Where am I?

52:12.557 --> 52:16.974
Yes, life can be wonderful
if you're not afraid of it.

52:17.557 --> 52:23.016
All it needs is courage, imagination

52:24.557 --> 52:27.641
and a little dough.

52:29.807 --> 52:31.141
Now what's the matter?

52:31.391 --> 52:34.224
I'll never dance again!
I'm a cripple.

52:34.474 --> 52:36.891
- Pure hysteria! It's in your mind.
- It isn't true.

52:37.141 --> 52:39.557
- Otherwise you'd fight!
- What is there to fight for?

52:39.807 --> 52:42.057
Ah, you see? You admit it.

52:42.307 --> 52:45.057
What is there to fight for?
Everything!

52:45.307 --> 52:47.140
Life itself! Isn't that enough?

52:47.390 --> 52:51.473
To be lived, suffered, enjoyed!
What is there to fight for?

52:51.723 --> 52:54.223
Life is a beautiful,
magnificent thing.

52:54.473 --> 52:56.973
Even to a jellyfish.

52:57.223 --> 53:01.390
What is there to fight for?
You have your art, your dancing!

53:01.640 --> 53:03.640
But I can't dance without legs!

53:03.890 --> 53:05.640
I know a man without arms

53:05.890 --> 53:10.140
who can play a scherzo on a violin
and does it all with his toes.

53:10.390 --> 53:13.140
The trouble is you won't fight.
You've given in.

53:13.390 --> 53:15.723
Continually dwelling
on sickness and death!

53:15.973 --> 53:17.306
But,

53:17.556 --> 53:20.223
there's something
just as inevitable as death

53:20.473 --> 53:22.806
and that's life.
Life, life, life!

53:23.056 --> 53:24.973
Think of the power
that's in the universe!

53:25.223 --> 53:27.972
Moving the earth, growing the trees!

53:28.222 --> 53:30.555
And that's the same power
within you.

53:30.805 --> 53:36.180
If you'd only have courage
and the will to use it.

53:36.972 --> 53:39.555
Good night!

53:44.639 --> 53:48.764
Faster, faster.
Come on, dance!

53:49.305 --> 53:52.014
Beautiful.

53:55.222 --> 53:58.347
I fooled you that time.
Come on.

54:04.139 --> 54:07.221
Take that away.
Come on!

54:13.554 --> 54:14.971
What's the news?

54:15.221 --> 54:17.554
Europe in a race for armaments.

54:17.804 --> 54:19.304
Anything interesting?

54:19.554 --> 54:22.638
A write-up about Mr. And
Mrs. Zanzig, the mind readers.

54:22.888 --> 54:24.388
I played with them years ago.

54:24.638 --> 54:27.721
They say they can transfer thoughts
to each other.

54:27.971 --> 54:28.804
Nonsense!

54:29.054 --> 54:30.054
Then how is it done?

54:30.304 --> 54:35.763
Not transference. I was with him once
when he sent his wife a telegram.

54:40.138 --> 54:41.388
More coffee?

54:41.638 --> 54:44.513
Just a half cup.

54:50.886 --> 54:52.136
I'm sorry, I didn't intend...

54:52.386 --> 54:56.053
Oh no, it's good exercise.

54:58.886 --> 55:02.886
Look at you,
hopping around like a two year-old.

55:03.136 --> 55:05.053
I think there's an improvement.

55:05.303 --> 55:07.970
Definitely.

55:09.220 --> 55:12.553
- But I get so nervous doing nothing.
- Nothing?

55:12.803 --> 55:15.553
I welcome every new hole
in your socks.

55:15.803 --> 55:18.136
Housework and cooking,
what more do you want?

55:18.386 --> 55:20.470
Keep fighting, that's all.

55:20.720 --> 55:24.220
That reminds me,
Mrs. Alsop's on the warpath again.

55:24.470 --> 55:27.635
She wants to know how long
I'm going to stay.

55:27.885 --> 55:30.302
Tell her to mind her own business!
We pay our rent.

55:30.552 --> 55:32.552
Oh no, there's a month owing.

55:32.802 --> 55:36.052
Since they postponed the Middlesex
opening, it's upset everything.

55:36.302 --> 55:38.552
Don't worry.
I can handle the old girl.

55:38.802 --> 55:42.219
All she needs
is a little pinch and a pat.

55:42.469 --> 55:44.385
Don't you think
I should go to a hospital?

55:44.635 --> 55:46.719
I do not.

55:46.969 --> 55:50.219
You'd have one problem
off your hands.

55:50.469 --> 55:52.635
After the Middlesex,
our problems are over.

55:52.885 --> 55:58.969
You know, preaching and moralizing
to you has really affected me.

55:59.219 --> 56:01.552
I'm beginning to believe it myself.

56:01.802 --> 56:04.219
I haven't taken a drink
since I've known you.

56:04.469 --> 56:05.469
Wonderful.

56:05.719 --> 56:08.134
And I'm not going to,
even on opening night.

56:08.384 --> 56:09.968
You don't need it.

56:10.218 --> 56:13.218
You're excruciatingly funny
without it.

56:13.468 --> 56:15.968
Oh, yes.

56:16.218 --> 56:20.718
- What's that?
- Maybe a letter from Redfern.

56:50.383 --> 56:52.633
Just the man I want to see!

56:52.883 --> 56:55.883
How thrilling!

56:56.883 --> 57:00.050
This is no joke. When are you
getting rid of that girl upstairs?

57:00.300 --> 57:02.717
- Don't be jealous.
- Jealous!

57:02.967 --> 57:04.883
What have you done to your hair?

57:05.133 --> 57:07.133
Where are your spit curls?

57:07.383 --> 57:10.967
Never mind all that!
You owe me four weeks' rent.

57:11.217 --> 57:14.383
- Have I denied the fact?
- You'd better not.

57:14.633 --> 57:19.217
Sybil, you really want to hurt me,
don't you? You little minx.

57:19.467 --> 57:20.717
Behave yourself!

57:20.967 --> 57:23.133
I get so full of nonsense
when I'm around you.

57:23.383 --> 57:25.467
You fool!

57:25.717 --> 57:27.716
What about that girl upstairs?

57:27.966 --> 57:29.549
Now, now. Be patient.

57:29.799 --> 57:31.466
You'd better
get rid of her this week.

57:31.716 --> 57:34.632
Bear with me. I know
it's been a trial for both of us.

57:34.882 --> 57:37.049
Both of us!
Who are you kidding?

57:37.299 --> 57:38.382
You!

57:38.632 --> 57:43.216
You wonderful
little plum pudding, you!

57:43.466 --> 57:46.841
But we must behave ourselves.

57:55.966 --> 57:57.716
That takes care of the rent.

57:57.966 --> 58:03.091
- Was there any post?
- No. That was for Mrs. Alsop.

58:10.298 --> 58:13.465
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine
That is the life for me</i>

58:13.715 --> 58:15.631
<i>Cavorting and spawning
every morning</i>

58:15.881 --> 58:17.298
<i>Under the deep blue sea</i>

58:17.548 --> 58:21.131
<i>To have no fear of a fisherman's net
Oh what fun to be gay and all wet</i>

58:21.381 --> 58:26.465
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine
That is the life for me</i>

58:31.631 --> 58:32.715
Funny thing,

58:32.965 --> 58:34.881
I dreamt I was a sardine.

58:35.131 --> 58:37.715
I dreamt it was lunchtime,
and I was, uh...

58:37.965 --> 58:40.381
swimming along,
looking for a little bit of bait

58:40.631 --> 58:44.381
and I found myself passing
a large bed of kelp.

58:44.631 --> 58:46.714
And there on it, I mean in it,

58:46.964 --> 58:50.630
was the prettiest little fin
you've ever seen.

58:50.880 --> 58:54.380
That's what we call them
in the fish world: Fins.

58:54.630 --> 58:56.880
The way she maneuvered her tail,

58:57.130 --> 58:59.464
with such finesse.

58:59.714 --> 59:02.797
She seemed to be in trouble.

59:06.297 --> 59:09.880
<i>All right old boy,
let's all go home.</i>

59:10.130 --> 59:14.755
Yeah, you're right. Good night.

59:22.464 --> 59:25.380
I beg your pardon.

59:30.879 --> 59:34.754
Blasted! These shoes are too tight.

59:47.462 --> 59:50.712
Good night.

01:00:56.877 --> 01:00:59.877
What are you doing up so late?

01:01:00.127 --> 01:01:03.044
I just couldn't sleep.

01:01:03.294 --> 01:01:07.377
Then I saw the partition doors open,
so I got up an hour ago.

01:01:07.627 --> 01:01:09.627
Some hot soup?

01:01:09.877 --> 01:01:12.210
No, thanks.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.960
You look tired.

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.960
Do I?

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.460
I know you're worried,

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:23.460
but the Middlesex contract's signed,
it's just the delay.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.709
There's no delay.

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:28.626
What do you mean?

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:31.293
It happened tonight.

01:01:31.543 --> 01:01:34.501
The Middlesex?

01:01:34.793 --> 01:01:37.043
Why didn't you let me know?

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:41.376
I didn't want you to go through
the suspense of it.

01:01:41.626 --> 01:01:47.959
Then forget everything now,
and get a good night's rest.

01:01:48.293 --> 01:01:51.834
They walked out on me.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:55.376
They haven't done that
since I was a beginner.

01:01:55.626 --> 01:01:58.376
The cycle's complete.

01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:03.043
But you've changed your name!
They didn't know you.

01:02:03.293 --> 01:02:07.292
No, I wasn't funny.
The trouble is, I was sober.

01:02:07.542 --> 01:02:10.292
I should have been drunk
before going on.

01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:12.875
I still insist
they didn't know you.

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:15.542
Just as well they didn't.

01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:19.208
Naturally! You can't expect too much
the first performance.

01:02:19.458 --> 01:02:21.625
You haven't worked in a long time.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:25.625
But you'll see, tonight
when you go back it'll be different.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:29.000
I'm not going back.

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:30.625
Why?

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:36.250
They've terminated the contract.

01:02:36.292 --> 01:02:38.458
But they can't do that!

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:42.208
They can. They have.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:47.249
You were engaged for the week!
You can insist.

01:02:48.457 --> 01:02:52.457
It's no use. I'm finished.

01:02:52.707 --> 01:02:55.582
Through!

01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:57.957
Nonsense.

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:01.957
Are you, Calvero, going to allow
one performance to destroy you?

01:03:02.207 --> 01:03:04.957
Of course not!
You're too great an artist.

01:03:05.207 --> 01:03:10.041
Now's the time to show them
what you're made of. Time to fight!

01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:13.541
Remember what you told me,
standing there by that window?

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.624
Remember what you said?

01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:19.207
About the power of the universe
moving the earth?

01:03:19.457 --> 01:03:24.541
Growing the trees,
and that power being within you?

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:29.665
Now is the time to use that power,
and to fight!

01:03:30.456 --> 01:03:33.123
Calvero, look! I'm walking!

01:03:33.373 --> 01:03:35.956
I'm walking!

01:03:36.706 --> 01:03:39.790
I'm walking!

01:04:13.122 --> 01:04:16.705
Just think, I can walk!

01:04:16.955 --> 01:04:20.705
Well, I can't any further.
I have to quit right here.

01:04:20.955 --> 01:04:22.622
Do you realize
it's almost five o'clock?

01:04:22.872 --> 01:04:26.039
I know. But I couldn't stay
in that room another minute.

01:04:26.289 --> 01:04:28.789
I don't blame you.

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:31.622
Cheer up.

01:04:31.872 --> 01:04:36.372
Look, the dawn is breaking.

01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:39.455
That's a good omen.

01:04:39.705 --> 01:04:43.205
I know it. It will be.

01:04:43.455 --> 01:04:46.704
It must be.

01:04:47.121 --> 01:04:50.788
Don't be discouraged.
You'll get on your feet again.

01:04:51.037 --> 01:04:52.288
On my what again?

01:04:52.538 --> 01:04:54.621
But think how fortunate we are!

01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:56.704
At least we both have our health.

01:04:56.954 --> 01:05:01.871
Now I can get a job. There's always
chorus work to keep us going.

01:05:02.121 --> 01:05:03.204
Us?

01:05:03.454 --> 01:05:05.288
Yes.

01:05:05.538 --> 01:05:07.371
Us.

01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:12.371
You and me. Together.

01:06:53.784 --> 01:06:55.534
- Mr. Bodalink!
- What is it?

01:06:55.784 --> 01:06:59.284
- The front office, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:59.534 --> 01:07:03.451
Terry, I was about to leave you
a note about Calvero.

01:07:03.701 --> 01:07:06.784
Have him see me tomorrow morning
before your audition.

01:07:07.034 --> 01:07:10.659
- He's all set for the part.
- Wonderful!

01:07:53.783 --> 01:07:55.950
Just a minute.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.033
Why, Terry!
I didn't hear you come in.

01:07:59.283 --> 01:08:00.950
How could you?

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.783
Allow me. My friends,

01:08:04.033 --> 01:08:06.616
Mademoiselle Thereza.

01:08:06.866 --> 01:08:09.032
How do you do.

01:08:09.282 --> 01:08:12.782
We're just having a little beer,
Bach and Beethoven.

01:08:13.032 --> 01:08:15.116
Isn't it rather late for music?

01:08:15.366 --> 01:08:17.866
Not if we play a nocturne.

01:08:18.116 --> 01:08:20.448
Proceed with the butchery,

01:08:20.698 --> 01:08:24.948
only make it soft,
sentimental, largo.

01:08:25.198 --> 01:08:28.866
- I'll stick to beer if you don't mind.
- Coming up!

01:08:29.116 --> 01:08:30.366
But what will Mrs. Alsop say?

01:08:30.616 --> 01:08:34.198
A fine thing! After climbing up
three flights of stairs,

01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:39.948
I've just discovered I've got nothing
but a lot of empty beer bottles.

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:43.198
Why, Terry, is the show out?

01:08:43.448 --> 01:08:45.698
I didn't realize it was that late.

01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:47.281
It's very late.

01:08:47.531 --> 01:08:49.531
That's our cue, we'd better go.

01:08:49.781 --> 01:08:53.198
You're not going!
We were just about to celebrate.

01:08:53.448 --> 01:08:56.281
- But it's almost one o'clock.
- So what?

01:08:56.531 --> 01:08:57.865
Wait a minute!

01:08:58.115 --> 01:09:02.115
Calvero gave me three horses
and I doubled up on them!

01:09:02.365 --> 01:09:05.698
Now that only happens
once in a lifetime.

01:09:05.948 --> 01:09:11.198
Wait a minute. Those stairs
are steep. I'll lead the way.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:17.781
That's all right, I can handle myself.
Don't you worry about me.

01:09:23.948 --> 01:09:26.738
Good night.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:47.613
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm drunk.

01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:51.447
It's your health I'm worried about.
You know what the doctor said.

01:09:51.697 --> 01:09:56.447
Yes, I shouldn't drink.
It's bad for the heart.

01:09:56.697 --> 01:09:59.114
What about the mind?

01:09:59.364 --> 01:10:04.030
I suppose that should be clear and
alert so I can contemplate the future.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.363
The prospects of joining
those gray-haired nymphs

01:10:07.613 --> 01:10:10.279
that sleep
on the Thames embankment at night.

01:10:10.529 --> 01:10:12.779
You'll never join them
while I'm alive.

01:10:13.029 --> 01:10:16.696
Oh, I forgot to get your supper!
I'm no good.

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:20.696
I'll get it later on.
First I'm going to put you to bed.

01:10:20.946 --> 01:10:23.529
But you've had nothing to eat.

01:10:23.779 --> 01:10:25.363
Did you take your medicine?

01:10:25.613 --> 01:10:26.779
What medicine?

01:10:27.029 --> 01:10:29.946
You didn't.
It's to give you an appetite.

01:10:30.196 --> 01:10:31.946
I've quenched my appetite.

01:10:32.196 --> 01:10:33.779
You'll be ill again,
if you don't eat.

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:37.113
Well, I much prefer to drink.

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:40.196
A man's true character comes out
when he's drunk.

01:10:40.446 --> 01:10:43.279
Me, I'm funnier.

01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:45.528
Too bad I didn't drink
at the Middlesex.

01:10:45.778 --> 01:10:47.528
I've got good news for you.

01:10:47.778 --> 01:10:50.945
Mr. Bodalink wants to see you
tomorrow morning.

01:10:51.195 --> 01:10:52.445
Who's he?

01:10:52.695 --> 01:10:56.445
Our dance director. He wants you
to play a clown in the new ballet.

01:10:56.695 --> 01:10:58.778
I'm through clowning.

01:10:59.028 --> 01:11:02.445
Life isn't a gag anymore.
I can't see the joke.

01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:05.111
From now on, I'm a retired humorist.

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.361
You'll feel differently
in the morning.

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:10.028
No, I hate the theatre!

01:11:10.278 --> 01:11:13.445
Someday I'll buy
an acre of ground somewhere

01:11:13.695 --> 01:11:18.945
and raise a few cut flowers,
and make a living that way.

01:11:28.694 --> 01:11:33.402
What do you think?
It's all settled. I play the clown.

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:38.444
Let's sit down over here
and you can tell me all about it.

01:11:44.277 --> 01:11:48.194
Of course, the salary isn't much.

01:11:48.444 --> 01:11:49.860
Two pounds?

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:54.527
But it's a foot in the door.
Naturally I'm not using my own name.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:58.485
This Bodalink's a nice chap.
Says you're quite a dancer.

01:11:58.735 --> 01:12:02.527
If you'd have come to the theatre,
you might have known it.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.276
Why didn't you tell me
you were auditioning?

01:12:05.526 --> 01:12:07.359
I wanted to surprise you.

01:12:07.609 --> 01:12:10.609
I'm not sure of the outcome.
It depends on Mr. Postant.

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:14.943
Postant!
I thought he'd retired years ago.

01:12:15.193 --> 01:12:17.026
Why, do you know him?

01:12:17.276 --> 01:12:20.359
Last time I worked for Postant,
I was the headline here.

01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:23.568
Footlights!

01:12:42.818 --> 01:12:44.567
Your hands are quite cold.

01:12:44.817 --> 01:12:47.942
I think I've got the girl. Young,
sympathetic, a brilliant dancer.

01:12:48.192 --> 01:12:50.150
Bring her on!

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.567
Thereza, please!

01:12:53.858 --> 01:12:56.108
You understand
it's purely improvising.

01:12:56.358 --> 01:13:00.733
That's how I always judge a dancer.

01:13:00.775 --> 01:13:02.358
This is Thereza, Mr. Postant.

01:13:02.608 --> 01:13:03.650
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.692
You'll be dancing to Mr. Neville's
music. Listen to it first.

01:13:08.942 --> 01:13:12.567
This is Mr. Neville, our composer.

01:13:12.817 --> 01:13:17.067
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

01:13:17.775 --> 01:13:20.192
I believe we've met before.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:23.317
Really?

01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:09.564
It's 12:30, we'd better call lunch.
Lunch everybody! Back at 1:30.

01:15:09.814 --> 01:15:13.189
Allow me to congratulate
the next prima ballerina.

01:15:13.439 --> 01:15:17.272
You're sopping wet, my dear.
Get your coat.

01:15:17.522 --> 01:15:20.480
Put in on and then
we'll talk business.

01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:23.814
Allow me.

01:15:24.313 --> 01:15:28.646
- May I also congratulate you?
- Thank you.

01:15:30.604 --> 01:15:34.937
Come dear. We'll meet at my office
at 2:30 and fix up her contract.

01:15:35.187 --> 01:15:36.229
But we're rehearsing at 2.

01:15:36.479 --> 01:15:38.187
Make it 6, after rehearsal.

01:15:38.437 --> 01:15:42.271
Run up to your dressing room
before you get a chill.

01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:46.146
- Where's Neville?
- Coming!

01:15:51.687 --> 01:15:55.937
<i>All right Frank,
turn off those lights.</i>

01:16:16.186 --> 01:16:18.811
Here I am.

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:25.061
I was looking for you outside.

01:16:25.311 --> 01:16:28.520
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:32.936
I'd be ridiculous in the light.
Look at me, I'm shameless.

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:36.395
But I can't help it.

01:16:37.186 --> 01:16:42.561
My dear, you are a true artist.

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:46.894
True artist.

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:52.935
This is absurd. Ridiculous.

01:16:58.019 --> 01:17:01.519
I've waited for this moment.

01:17:01.519 --> 01:17:04.435
I love you.

01:17:05.477 --> 01:17:08.519
I've wanted to say it for so long.

01:17:08.769 --> 01:17:12.977
Ever since the day you thought
I was a woman of the street.

01:17:13.227 --> 01:17:15.727
You took me in,

01:17:15.977 --> 01:17:18.394
cared for me,

01:17:18.644 --> 01:17:21.519
saved my life,

01:17:21.769 --> 01:17:23.685
inspired it.

01:17:23.934 --> 01:17:27.268
But above all that,
I just love you.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:31.143
Please, Calvero, marry me.

01:17:31.393 --> 01:17:35.893
- What nonsense is this?
- It isn't nonsense.

01:17:36.143 --> 01:17:38.309
My dear, I'm an old man.

01:17:38.559 --> 01:17:40.476
I don't care what you are.

01:17:40.726 --> 01:17:45.601
I love you.
That's all that matters.

01:17:48.893 --> 01:17:50.768
Latest news, express!

01:17:51.018 --> 01:17:54.268
While you're having lunch,
I'm going to see about my wig.

01:17:54.518 --> 01:17:55.559
Then I'll go with you.

01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:58.684
You'd better have lunch first.
I might be delayed.

01:17:58.934 --> 01:18:01.768
I'll see you back at the theatre.

01:18:02.018 --> 01:18:04.642
Have a good lunch.

01:18:07.142 --> 01:18:09.017
Oh, hello there.

01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:13.017
I'm the man at the piano
who played a moment ago.

01:18:13.267 --> 01:18:14.517
It's quite crowded.

01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:16.225
Always is at lunch time.

01:18:16.475 --> 01:18:18.933
Two?

01:18:20.225 --> 01:18:23.142
Very well.

01:18:37.975 --> 01:18:40.933
Your order, please.

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:45.557
Bacon and eggs, toast and tea.

01:18:45.807 --> 01:18:48.724
The same.

01:18:49.932 --> 01:18:52.849
That's always safe.

01:18:53.099 --> 01:18:56.724
Beautiful day to be rehearsing.

01:18:57.349 --> 01:18:59.974
Although the papers
are predicting more rain.

01:19:00.224 --> 01:19:03.182
Really?

01:19:05.849 --> 01:19:07.557
What's the joke?

01:19:07.807 --> 01:19:11.891
I finally have the chance to talk
to you and I've nothing to say.

01:19:12.141 --> 01:19:15.432
What is more eloquent than silence?

01:19:15.682 --> 01:19:19.307
- I'd better change tables.
- I won't bite.

01:19:19.557 --> 01:19:24.431
I'm not too sure. I was
severely frostbitten a moment ago.

01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:25.806
What do you mean?

01:19:26.056 --> 01:19:28.390
This morning.
When we were introduced.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.598
I don't understand.

01:19:30.848 --> 01:19:33.681
My reception was rather cool,
I thought.

01:19:33.931 --> 01:19:35.640
I still don't understand.

01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:37.723
I'm sorry.

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:39.973
I seem to be getting
a little involved.

01:19:40.223 --> 01:19:43.098
You see, I had an idea
that we'd met before.

01:19:43.348 --> 01:19:45.265
Well, perhaps we have.

01:19:45.515 --> 01:19:48.848
If we haven't,
then you have a twin sister.

01:19:49.098 --> 01:19:50.473
Who is she?

01:19:50.723 --> 01:19:53.306
Do you really want to know?

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:55.806
Yes.

01:19:56.056 --> 01:19:58.265
A young girl
who used to work at Sardou's,

01:19:58.515 --> 01:20:01.306
a stationary shop
where I bought music paper.

01:20:01.556 --> 01:20:04.305
A very shy, reticent girl.

01:20:04.555 --> 01:20:06.764
She seldom spoke.

01:20:07.014 --> 01:20:10.680
But her smile was warm
and appealing.

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:14.555
I read many things into it.

01:20:14.555 --> 01:20:18.972
I also was shy.
It was a bond between us.

01:20:19.222 --> 01:20:21.972
She used to give me
extra music sheets,

01:20:22.222 --> 01:20:24.889
and occasionally extra change.

01:20:25.139 --> 01:20:30.639
Which, frankly, I accepted.
Hunger has no conscience.

01:20:30.889 --> 01:20:34.097
The day after my symphony
played the Albert Hall,

01:20:34.347 --> 01:20:36.222
I went back to the shop,

01:20:36.472 --> 01:20:42.014
but she'd gone.
They said she'd left months ago.

01:20:42.264 --> 01:20:44.013
You haven't seen her since?

01:20:44.263 --> 01:20:47.054
Well, have I?

01:20:48.429 --> 01:20:50.137
Yes, you have.

01:20:50.388 --> 01:20:52.096
I know.

01:20:52.346 --> 01:20:55.429
I lost my job giving you
those extra music sheets.

01:20:55.679 --> 01:20:58.721
- You won't hold that against me?
- Of course not.

01:20:58.971 --> 01:21:00.888
I was very young then.

01:21:01.138 --> 01:21:02.763
You're very young now.

01:21:03.013 --> 01:21:08.471
I don't know.
Soon I shall be an old married lady.

01:21:08.637 --> 01:21:11.138
Then I wish you lots of happiness.

01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:13.054
Thank you.

01:21:13.304 --> 01:21:16.304
I wish that waitress would hurry.

01:21:16.721 --> 01:21:21.429
Before we do the choreography,
I'll explain the story.

01:21:22.346 --> 01:21:24.053
It's about Harlequinade.

01:21:24.303 --> 01:21:27.636
Terry is Columbine.
She is dying in a London garret.

01:21:27.886 --> 01:21:31.720
Harlequin, who is the lover,
and the clowns, are at her bedside.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.928
She asks to be carried
to the window.

01:21:34.178 --> 01:21:36.845
She wants to look upon the rooftops
one last time.

01:21:37.095 --> 01:21:39.928
The clowns weep. She smiles.

01:21:40.178 --> 01:21:42.553
Their clothes are not for sorrow
but for laughter.

01:21:42.803 --> 01:21:45.386
She wants them to perform,
do their tricks.

01:21:45.636 --> 01:21:47.303
The clowns can do their comedy.

01:21:47.553 --> 01:21:49.553
- While she's dying?
- Yes.

01:21:49.803 --> 01:21:53.011
Let me see, where am I?

01:21:54.178 --> 01:21:56.803
As the clowns perform,
she becomes delirious.

01:21:57.053 --> 01:22:00.678
Spirits of Columbines
dance before her.

01:22:00.928 --> 01:22:03.594
Then she dies.
That's the first scene.

01:22:03.844 --> 01:22:06.760
Next is the graveyard
where Columbine was buried.

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:09.844
Harlequin, her lover,
enters in the moonlight.

01:22:10.094 --> 01:22:13.844
He tries to resurrect her
from the grave.

01:22:14.094 --> 01:22:15.802
But he fails.

01:22:16.052 --> 01:22:18.094
The spirits tell him not to grieve.

01:22:18.344 --> 01:22:21.260
His love is not in the grave,
but everywhere.

01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:23.802
Then Terry appears.

01:22:24.052 --> 01:22:25.594
That's your solo, then the finale.

01:22:25.844 --> 01:22:30.344
We'd better get a move on.
It's only 3 weeks to the opening.

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:02.208
Calvero!

01:29:02.958 --> 01:29:03.875
What is it?

01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:06.375
- How's it going?
- Wonderful. Thumbs up.

01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:09.292
- I wish the dance was over.
- You've nothing to worry about.

01:29:09.542 --> 01:29:11.375
I'm scared. Pray for me.

01:29:11.625 --> 01:29:16.958
God helps those
who help themselves. Good luck.

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:34.332
- I can't go on!
- What?

01:29:34.582 --> 01:29:36.791
My legs! I can't move!

01:29:37.041 --> 01:29:37.957
It's nerves. Just move.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:41.041
No, I can't move. I'm paralyzed!

01:29:41.291 --> 01:29:44.207
Pure hysteria!
There's your cue, get on stage!

01:29:44.457 --> 01:29:50.374
No, I'm falling!
It's my legs, they're paralyzed!

01:29:50.707 --> 01:29:53.249
Get on that stage!

01:29:53.499 --> 01:29:58.082
See? There's nothing wrong
with your legs.

01:30:26.623 --> 01:30:33.081
Whoever you are, whatever it is,
just keep her going, that's all.

01:30:34.248 --> 01:30:37.206
I've lost a button.

01:30:37.248 --> 01:30:39.665
One of these.

01:30:39.915 --> 01:30:43.080
It's all right.

01:34:28.325 --> 01:34:31.617
Where's Calvero?
He told me to wait for him here.

01:34:31.867 --> 01:34:34.950
I'll send the call boy
to look for him.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.325
Supper is served.
You're sitting next to Mr. Postant.

01:34:40.867 --> 01:34:45.699
Supper is now being served
in both lounges.

01:34:51.616 --> 01:34:54.949
Come along, my dear.
You're next to me.

01:34:55.199 --> 01:34:59.616
Bodalink, you're down there
my dear fellow.

01:35:06.032 --> 01:35:07.949
Destiny must be a headwaitress.

01:35:08.199 --> 01:35:09.449
Why?

01:35:09.699 --> 01:35:12.699
She seats us together again.

01:35:12.949 --> 01:35:15.324
She might be your nemesis.

01:35:15.574 --> 01:35:18.032
I think I'll stand up
under the punishment.

01:35:18.282 --> 01:35:21.948
However, my congratulations.
Tonight you were wonderful.

01:35:22.198 --> 01:35:24.906
That's what they call
the old army game.

01:35:25.156 --> 01:35:29.781
Neville, they tell me
the army's caught up with you.

01:35:30.115 --> 01:35:31.573
You've joined the army?

01:35:31.823 --> 01:35:35.823
On the contrary, the army joined me.
I was drafted.

01:35:36.073 --> 01:35:36.948
That's awful!

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:39.948
I agree.
It's carrying the war too far.

01:35:40.198 --> 01:35:44.156
However, there's the possibility
of joining up here.

01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:45.573
Would you like to dance?

01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:50.615
I appeal to your patriotism.
You can't refuse a soldier.

01:35:51.698 --> 01:35:54.781
Governor, I remember
when you played Widow Twankey

01:35:55.031 --> 01:35:58.656
at the Theatre Royal,
Birmingham, in 1890...

01:35:58.906 --> 01:36:01.156
Go easy there laddie, go easy.

01:36:01.406 --> 01:36:04.489
Let's have a drink.

01:36:07.197 --> 01:36:10.739
Calvero, old boy,
how's the world treating you?

01:36:10.989 --> 01:36:13.614
Rather aggressively at the moment.

01:36:13.864 --> 01:36:15.405
You don't know me.

01:36:15.655 --> 01:36:18.114
The fact is most gratifying.

01:36:18.364 --> 01:36:20.989
Is that supposed to be funny?

01:36:21.239 --> 01:36:24.864
My man, you will never know.
Have a little drink.

01:36:25.114 --> 01:36:28.864
Only have it
at the other end of the bar.

01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:39.447
Pardon me, Miss Thereza is waiting
for you in the dress circle.

01:36:39.905 --> 01:36:40.780
What is it?

01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:44.321
Miss Thereza is waiting for you
in the dress circle.

01:36:44.571 --> 01:36:50.071
Will you kindly tell her not to worry,
I've gone home to bed.

01:36:50.321 --> 01:36:53.071
Very well, sir.

01:36:53.613 --> 01:36:55.154
What's happened to Calvero?

01:36:55.404 --> 01:36:58.654
He left word that he was tired
and had gone home to rest.

01:36:58.904 --> 01:37:04.738
I must go at once. Say good night
to Mr. Postant for me.

01:37:05.613 --> 01:37:08.488
I'll get you a cab.

01:37:43.403 --> 01:37:46.611
I'll walk home.

01:37:52.486 --> 01:37:56.778
He must be asleep, poor dear.
Too much excitement for him.

01:37:57.028 --> 01:37:59.236
I'm beginning
to feel the strain myself.

01:37:59.486 --> 01:38:00.611
Then I'll be going.

01:38:00.861 --> 01:38:02.860
Shall we see you
before you leave for camp?

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:06.194
I leave this morning.

01:38:06.985 --> 01:38:09.860
Good bye, Terry.

01:38:13.235 --> 01:38:14.777
No, don't!

01:38:15.027 --> 01:38:16.444
Say you love me, just a little.

01:38:16.694 --> 01:38:17.777
Please!

01:38:18.027 --> 01:38:19.444
I've tried to fight it, but I can't.

01:38:19.694 --> 01:38:22.235
Please, it's useless.

01:38:22.485 --> 01:38:26.485
You're as helpless as I am.
We love each other.

01:38:26.735 --> 01:38:28.485
I never said I loved you.

01:38:28.735 --> 01:38:31.069
Every look, gesture says it!

01:38:31.319 --> 01:38:32.610
No, don't say that!

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.777
I know how devoted
you are to Calvero,

01:38:35.027 --> 01:38:37.819
but marrying him isn't right.
It isn't fair to you.

01:38:38.069 --> 01:38:39.735
You're young, just beginning life.

01:38:39.985 --> 01:38:43.568
This devotion is idealistic.
Your youth!

01:38:43.818 --> 01:38:47.109
But it isn't love.

01:38:49.359 --> 01:38:55.026
No, you're wrong.
I really love him.

01:38:55.693 --> 01:38:58.693
You pity him.

01:39:00.276 --> 01:39:02.734
It's more than pity.

01:39:02.984 --> 01:39:07.943
It's something I've lived with,
grown to.

01:39:08.234 --> 01:39:13.651
It's his soul, his sweetness,
his sadness...

01:39:13.901 --> 01:39:18.193
Nothing will ever separate me
from that.

01:39:23.567 --> 01:39:26.525
Good night, Terry.

01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:30.025
Good bye.

01:39:47.150 --> 01:39:48.692
Listen to this one:

01:39:48.942 --> 01:39:52.442
"With ease, Thereza pirouetted
and flexed radiant authority."

01:39:52.692 --> 01:39:54.983
"She was light,
quicksilver, efflorescing!"

01:39:55.233 --> 01:39:59.608
"A Diana spinning
wisps of beauty about her."

01:40:00.525 --> 01:40:03.066
Very good.

01:40:03.316 --> 01:40:06.691
Well, you've done it.

01:40:06.941 --> 01:40:10.566
How's it feel to wake up famous?

01:40:11.857 --> 01:40:18.482
That's right, have a good cry
and enjoy it. It only happens once.

01:40:22.107 --> 01:40:24.024
Let's marry, soon.

01:40:24.274 --> 01:40:27.566
If we could only get away.
That house in the country,

01:40:27.816 --> 01:40:30.357
where we could have
peace and happiness.

01:40:30.607 --> 01:40:32.066
Happiness.

01:40:32.316 --> 01:40:35.691
The first time I've ever heard you
mention that word.

01:40:35.941 --> 01:40:39.232
- I'm always happy with you.
- Are you?

01:40:39.482 --> 01:40:42.148
Of course. I love you.

01:40:42.398 --> 01:40:44.648
Wasted on an old man.

01:40:44.898 --> 01:40:46.773
Love is never wasted.

01:40:47.023 --> 01:40:51.731
Terry, you're like a nun, shutting
everything else out for my sake.

01:40:51.981 --> 01:40:54.190
It isn't fair, wasting your youth.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.690
You deserve more than this.

01:40:57.815 --> 01:40:59.606
Let me go away.

01:40:59.856 --> 01:41:02.023
What's come over you?

01:41:02.273 --> 01:41:05.440
I can't help it!
If I only had the strength to leave!

01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:07.898
But I stay on, tormenting myself.

01:41:08.148 --> 01:41:09.731
The whole thing is false.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:15.315
In the few years I have left,
I must have truth.

01:41:15.815 --> 01:41:18.773
That's all I have left.

01:41:19.023 --> 01:41:21.564
Truth.

01:41:21.814 --> 01:41:24.064
That's all I want.

01:41:24.314 --> 01:41:26.730
And if possible, a little dignity.

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.605
If you leave me, I'll kill myself.

01:41:29.855 --> 01:41:33.230
I hate life!
The torment, the cruelty of it.

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.689
I couldn't go on without you!
Don't you understand, I love you!

01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:41.647
- You want to love me.
- But I do, I do!

01:41:41.897 --> 01:41:45.647
It's Neville you love.
I don't blame you.

01:41:45.897 --> 01:41:47.230
That isn't true.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:50.272
He's the composer
you knew at Sardou's.

01:41:50.522 --> 01:41:53.605
Yes. I didn't tell you
because I thought it...

01:41:53.855 --> 01:41:57.980
Inevitable.
I prophesized it, remember?

01:41:58.230 --> 01:41:59.939
A balcony overlooking the Thames!

01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:01.646
But it isn't true!

01:42:01.896 --> 01:42:04.812
In the twilight
he will tell you he loves you.

01:42:05.063 --> 01:42:07.604
And you will tell him
you've always loved him.

01:42:07.854 --> 01:42:11.062
But I don't love him! I never did.

01:42:11.313 --> 01:42:12.979
It was his music, his art.

01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:15.062
He meant a world
that had been denied me.

01:42:15.312 --> 01:42:16.604
You look so well together.

01:42:16.854 --> 01:42:20.896
But I don't love him! I never did.

01:42:21.146 --> 01:42:26.146
Please, you must believe me!
You must!

01:42:27.104 --> 01:42:31.188
Dancing's excellent,
but the comedy's poor.

01:42:31.438 --> 01:42:35.021
We'll have to get rid of that clown.

01:42:39.271 --> 01:42:44.311
I've called Blackmore's Agency,
they're sending down another man.

01:42:44.561 --> 01:42:45.895
You know who that clown is?

01:42:46.145 --> 01:42:48.978
I don't care if it's Calvero himself.
He isn't funny.

01:42:49.228 --> 01:42:51.061
- But that's who it is.
- What?

01:42:51.311 --> 01:42:53.478
Calvero,
only he's under another name.

01:42:53.728 --> 01:42:56.145
Why the devil didn't you tell me?

01:42:56.395 --> 01:42:58.061
He didn't want it known.

01:42:58.311 --> 01:43:03.395
Poor old Calvero. Well, that's
different, we'd better keep him.

01:43:03.645 --> 01:43:07.895
After all,
the comedy isn't too important.

01:43:07.895 --> 01:43:12.728
But I didn't see him
at the supper party on opening night.

01:43:12.978 --> 01:43:15.770
He didn't show up.
That's why Thereza left so early.

01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:17.103
What's he got to do with her?

01:43:17.353 --> 01:43:19.353
Believe it or not,
she's going to marry him.

01:43:19.603 --> 01:43:21.102
That old reprobate?

01:43:21.352 --> 01:43:24.060
Bless my soul,
there's hope for me yet.

01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:26.644
It's time for rehearsal.

01:43:26.894 --> 01:43:28.060
Wait a minute.

01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:33.769
I'll call Blackmore's and cancel
that fellow before he gets down here.

01:43:34.519 --> 01:43:36.519
If you finish rehearsing early,
don't wait for me.

01:43:36.769 --> 01:43:41.644
I've so many things to do,
but I'll be home by six.

01:43:43.519 --> 01:43:46.144
- Calvero?
- Griffin!

01:43:46.394 --> 01:43:49.394
I haven't seen you in ages!
Where are you working?

01:43:49.644 --> 01:43:51.352
Nowhere. I'm looking for a job.

01:43:51.602 --> 01:43:54.185
Blackmore sent me down
to see this new ballet.

01:43:54.435 --> 01:43:55.435
The Harlequinade?

01:43:55.685 --> 01:43:58.185
I understand the clown's
not very good

01:43:58.435 --> 01:44:02.559
and I could get the part.
Wish me luck.

01:44:02.809 --> 01:44:05.893
- Good luck, old man.
- Thanks.

01:44:55.225 --> 01:44:58.600
Mrs. Alsop!

01:45:03.492 --> 01:45:06.283
What is it?

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.867
What on earth is the matter?

01:45:09.117 --> 01:45:11.033
Calvero, where is he?
Have you seen him?

01:45:11.283 --> 01:45:14.575
- What do you mean?
- He's left me!

01:45:14.825 --> 01:45:18.033
He's gone!

01:46:20.115 --> 01:46:23.240
Would you like to contribute?

01:46:36.073 --> 01:46:39.906
Captain,
would you like to contribute?

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.739
No, that's all right, put it in.

01:46:51.989 --> 01:46:55.280
I've no false pride.

01:46:56.905 --> 01:46:58.614
Sit down, have a drink.

01:46:58.864 --> 01:47:04.030
Thank you, old man, not during
office hours. But I'll sit down.

01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:08.572
May I?

01:47:14.239 --> 01:47:15.530
How are you?

01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:17.280
Never felt better in my life!

01:47:17.530 --> 01:47:19.739
And how is the army treating you?

01:47:19.989 --> 01:47:21.696
Not so bad.

01:47:21.946 --> 01:47:25.821
I get up to London every other week.

01:47:26.988 --> 01:47:30.113
Have you seen Terry?

01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:33.779
How is she?

01:47:34.029 --> 01:47:35.613
After you left she was quite ill.

01:47:35.862 --> 01:47:37.904
But she's all right now?

01:47:38.154 --> 01:47:43.446
She's been touring the continent.
Since she got back she's much better.

01:47:44.196 --> 01:47:46.029
Good.

01:47:46.279 --> 01:47:49.487
She never told me
what happened between you.

01:47:50.154 --> 01:47:53.779
What could happen,
but the inevitable?

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.862
You see a great deal of her?

01:47:55.865 --> 01:47:57.250
Yes.

01:48:02.778 --> 01:48:04.195
Good.

01:48:04.445 --> 01:48:07.528
Somehow I knew
it would work out that way.

01:48:07.778 --> 01:48:09.903
Time is the great author.

01:48:10.153 --> 01:48:13.528
It always writes
the perfect ending.

01:48:17.028 --> 01:48:18.320
Great Scott!

01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:21.236
How do you do, Mr. Postant?

01:48:21.486 --> 01:48:24.945
Just a moment.
You're just the man I want to see.

01:48:25.195 --> 01:48:26.945
Would you like to contribute?

01:48:27.195 --> 01:48:28.861
Are you with that outfit outside?

01:48:29.111 --> 01:48:31.403
I am, sir.

01:48:31.653 --> 01:48:32.820
Oh, thank you.

01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:34.986
You oughtn't to be doing this!

01:48:35.236 --> 01:48:39.486
Why not? All the world's a stage.

01:48:39.736 --> 01:48:41.985
And this one is the most legitimate.

01:48:42.235 --> 01:48:48.319
I must go, or my confreres will
think I've run off with the takings.

01:48:49.194 --> 01:48:51.277
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:48:51.527 --> 01:48:54.069
Don't you think
I should tell Terry I've seen you?

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:57.860
Knowing I'm doing this sort of thing
might upset her.

01:48:58.110 --> 01:48:59.485
Although I don't mind it.

01:48:59.735 --> 01:49:02.319
There's something
about working the streets I like.

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:04.569
It's the tramp in me, I suppose.

01:49:04.819 --> 01:49:07.985
Wait a minute. Why don't you
come and see me at my office?

01:49:08.235 --> 01:49:09.402
- What about?
- Business.

01:49:09.652 --> 01:49:13.360
I never discuss business,
I leave that to my agent. Call him up.

01:49:13.610 --> 01:49:16.444
However I'm booked up solid,
you know.

01:49:16.694 --> 01:49:19.735
Au revoir, Gentlemen.

01:49:30.359 --> 01:49:34.859
Driver, stop!
Please, turn around.

01:49:43.359 --> 01:49:46.401
Keep the change.

01:49:53.401 --> 01:49:58.151
Cyrano de Bergerac,
without the nose.

01:49:58.693 --> 01:50:01.525
Let's sit down.

01:50:14.858 --> 01:50:18.108
So they told you, huh?

01:50:18.150 --> 01:50:22.192
I've been searching
all over London for you.

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.692
The same Terry.

01:50:25.733 --> 01:50:28.733
Am I?

01:50:29.192 --> 01:50:32.025
A little more grown up, that's all.

01:50:32.275 --> 01:50:35.775
I don't want to grow up.

01:50:36.067 --> 01:50:38.192
None of us do.

01:50:38.442 --> 01:50:42.066
But I had to, after you left.

01:50:45.232 --> 01:50:50.316
It's all for the best.
All for the best.

01:50:50.566 --> 01:50:53.441
Perhaps.

01:50:53.607 --> 01:50:56.691
I don't know.

01:50:57.274 --> 01:51:00.649
But something's gone.

01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:03.566
Gone forever.

01:51:03.816 --> 01:51:05.899
Nothing's gone,

01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:09.316
it only changes.

01:51:09.357 --> 01:51:11.107
I still love you.

01:51:11.357 --> 01:51:13.732
Of course you do.

01:51:13.982 --> 01:51:17.024
You always will.

01:51:17.691 --> 01:51:20.648
Calvero, come back.

01:51:20.898 --> 01:51:23.565
You've got to come back!

01:51:23.815 --> 01:51:28.690
I can't.
I must go forward.

01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.440
That's progress.

01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:33.773
Then let me go with you.

01:51:34.023 --> 01:51:38.523
I'll do everything in the world
to make you happy.

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:43.898
That's what hurts.
I know you will.

01:51:45.815 --> 01:51:49.148
Mr. Postant said
he'd give you a benefit.

01:51:49.398 --> 01:51:51.940
I don't want his charity.

01:51:52.190 --> 01:51:54.106
It isn't charity.

01:51:54.356 --> 01:51:58.023
He says it'd be the greatest
event in theatrical history.

01:51:58.273 --> 01:52:01.480
I'm not interested in events.

01:52:01.730 --> 01:52:04.772
But I would like a chance just
to show them I'm not through yet.

01:52:05.022 --> 01:52:07.397
Of course.

01:52:07.647 --> 01:52:10.105
I've still got ideas, you know.

01:52:10.355 --> 01:52:14.897
I've been working on,
working on... a comedy act,

01:52:15.147 --> 01:52:17.147
for myself and my friend.

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:19.064
It's sort of a musical satire.

01:52:19.314 --> 01:52:20.314
Wonderful!

01:52:20.564 --> 01:52:25.480
You know he's a very good pianist,
and me with the violin...

01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:30.064
A lot of very really
really very funny business.

01:52:40.688 --> 01:52:43.271
Come in.

01:52:46.604 --> 01:52:49.479
Sit down, my dear.
You look tired.

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:53.521
I've been working with the claque,
going over Calvero's jokes.

01:52:53.771 --> 01:52:56.229
I gave them cue sheets so
they'll know exactly where to laugh.

01:52:56.479 --> 01:52:58.938
Are the jokes as bad as all that?

01:52:59.187 --> 01:53:03.646
I'm worried. If he fails tonight,
it'll kill him. I know it.

01:53:03.896 --> 01:53:07.563
He won't fail. The audience
will be most sympathetic.

01:53:07.813 --> 01:53:10.813
But he doesn't want sympathy.
He keeps saying that.

01:53:11.063 --> 01:53:13.271
He wants to be a genuine success.

01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:18.479
What does he expect?
You know he's not the man he was.

01:53:18.729 --> 01:53:21.061
He mustn't be told that!

01:53:21.311 --> 01:53:23.395
Tell me, my dear,

01:53:23.645 --> 01:53:28.978
are you still going to marry him?

01:53:29.228 --> 01:53:31.561
I'll do anything in the world
to make him happy.

01:53:31.811 --> 01:53:34.561
He's a very lucky man.

01:53:34.811 --> 01:53:39.228
He's a very, very lucky man.

01:53:39.561 --> 01:53:42.061
I never thought we'd come to this.

01:53:42.311 --> 01:53:46.270
Here we have the star dressing room
without a dresser.

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.561
Oh well, I guess we can put up
with it for one night.

01:53:49.811 --> 01:53:51.145
Fred, the stage manager.

01:53:51.395 --> 01:53:54.061
Come in, Fred.

01:53:54.145 --> 01:53:57.186
Like old times,
seeing you in this room again.

01:53:57.436 --> 01:53:58.853
What's on your mind?

01:53:59.103 --> 01:54:03.519
You've got 10 minutes, because
there's 20 other acts to follow.

01:54:03.769 --> 01:54:06.935
You're in a song first,
finishing up with a musical act.

01:54:07.185 --> 01:54:09.102
I'll ring down
after you fall in the drum.

01:54:09.352 --> 01:54:11.269
No, after I'm carried off
in the drum.

01:54:11.519 --> 01:54:14.852
Right you are. Thank you, sir.

01:54:16.019 --> 01:54:20.394
If anybody else says it's like old
times, I'll jump out the window!

01:54:20.644 --> 01:54:24.269
First the doorman,
then the call boy,

01:54:24.519 --> 01:54:26.185
now the stage manager.

01:54:26.435 --> 01:54:27.935
It's me, Postant.

01:54:28.185 --> 01:54:33.227
It's like old times seeing you here
again putting on your war paint.

01:54:33.477 --> 01:54:36.435
I'll be down
watching the other acts.

01:54:36.685 --> 01:54:41.643
Yes, like old times.
Only in those days you were drunk.

01:54:41.893 --> 01:54:43.434
I'm supposed to be funnier
when I'm drunk.

01:54:43.684 --> 01:54:45.559
Maybe, but you were killing yourself.

01:54:45.809 --> 01:54:48.851
You know, anything for a laugh.
How's the house?

01:54:49.101 --> 01:54:51.934
Packed. Every face card in Europe
is out there:

01:54:52.184 --> 01:54:54.434
Kings, queens, jacks...

01:54:54.684 --> 01:54:57.684
- Is Neville out there?
- Yes. Came up specially.

01:54:57.934 --> 01:54:59.809
And what a program!

01:55:00.059 --> 01:55:04.143
Take a look at that. Every star
in the business is appearing.

01:55:04.393 --> 01:55:06.393
It'll be something,
following all this talent.

01:55:06.643 --> 01:55:10.559
Don't worry. Tonight you'll
make them look like amateurs.

01:55:10.809 --> 01:55:12.893
That's all any of us are. Amateurs.

01:55:13.143 --> 01:55:17.351
We don't live long enough
to be anything else.

01:55:17.434 --> 01:55:21.267
Well, as one old amateur
to another...

01:55:21.517 --> 01:55:25.558
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Mr. Postant.

01:55:52.558 --> 01:55:55.183
Come in.

01:55:58.308 --> 01:56:00.391
How do I look?

01:56:00.641 --> 01:56:01.932
Funny.

01:56:02.182 --> 01:56:05.557
I know what you're thinking,
my health and all that.

01:56:05.807 --> 01:56:07.974
But I had to take a drink.

01:56:08.224 --> 01:56:11.599
There's a creamy white light
turning off and on in my stomach.

01:56:11.849 --> 01:56:15.141
And that's not so good,
if I'm to be a success tonight.

01:56:15.391 --> 01:56:16.807
Is it really worth it?

01:56:17.057 --> 01:56:19.932
Not that I care for success,
but I don't want another failure.

01:56:20.182 --> 01:56:24.224
Whatever happens, there's always
that little home in the country.

01:56:24.474 --> 01:56:26.932
This is my home. Here.

01:56:27.182 --> 01:56:28.849
I thought you hated the theatre.

01:56:29.099 --> 01:56:35.016
I do. I also hate the sight of blood
but it's in my veins.

01:56:35.266 --> 01:56:37.391
Come in.

01:56:37.641 --> 01:56:39.724
Mr. Calvero, on stage please!

01:56:39.973 --> 01:56:43.515
Good luck, sir.
They're all waiting for you.

01:56:43.765 --> 01:56:46.390
Thanks.

01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:51.306
I don't like it.

01:56:51.556 --> 01:56:54.140
Everyone's so kind to me.

01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:57.765
Makes me feel isolated.

01:56:59.890 --> 01:57:02.598
Even you make me feel isolated.

01:57:02.848 --> 01:57:06.223
Why do you say that?

01:57:06.306 --> 01:57:08.723
I don't know.

01:57:08.973 --> 01:57:12.390
I really don't know.

01:57:14.015 --> 01:57:16.848
- Oh, your change.
- No, no.

01:57:17.098 --> 01:57:19.972
Of course!

01:57:21.889 --> 01:57:25.639
All right, turn it off up there!

01:57:28.722 --> 01:57:31.639
Your change is all ready.

01:57:31.889 --> 01:57:34.764
Good luck, my darling.

01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:37.680
- Aren't you going to watch?
- I can't.

01:57:37.930 --> 01:57:39.847
But remember I love you.

01:57:40.097 --> 01:57:41.180
Really?

01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:44.347
Always. With all my heart.

01:57:44.597 --> 01:57:45.805
Ready, Mr. Calvero?

01:57:46.055 --> 01:57:48.680
Good luck, my darling.

01:57:48.930 --> 01:57:51.847
Let her go!

01:57:58.347 --> 01:58:01.971
<i>I'm an animal trainer
A circus entertainer</i>

01:58:02.221 --> 01:58:07.513
<i>I've trained animals by the score
Lions, tigers and wild boar</i>

01:58:19.471 --> 01:58:22.638
That's not Phyllis!

01:58:31.679 --> 01:58:34.679
Where's Phyllis?

01:58:37.096 --> 01:58:39.803
There she is!

01:59:44.302 --> 01:59:47.760
<i>When I was three
My nurse told me</i>

01:59:48.010 --> 01:59:50.552
<i>About reincarnation</i>

01:59:50.802 --> 01:59:53.302
<i>And ever since
I've been convinced</i>

01:59:53.552 --> 01:59:55.594
<i>Thrilled with anticipation</i>

01:59:55.844 --> 01:59:58.094
<i>That when I leave this earth</i>

01:59:58.344 --> 02:00:00.509
<i>It makes my heart feel warm</i>

02:00:00.759 --> 02:00:02.843
<i>To know that I'll return</i>

02:00:03.093 --> 02:00:05.259
<i>In some other form</i>

02:00:05.509 --> 02:00:09.593
<i>But I don't want to be a tree</i>

02:00:09.843 --> 02:00:11.468
<i>Sticking in the ground</i>

02:00:11.718 --> 02:00:13.134
<i>I'd sooner be a flea</i>

02:00:13.384 --> 02:00:15.468
<i>I don't want to be a flower</i>

02:00:15.718 --> 02:00:17.384
<i>Waiting by the hour</i>

02:00:17.634 --> 02:00:20.593
<i>Hoping for a pollen to alight on me</i>

02:00:20.843 --> 02:00:24.051
<i>So when I cease to be</i>

02:00:24.301 --> 02:00:27.676
<i>I want to go back
I want to go back to the sea</i>

02:00:27.926 --> 02:00:31.259
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine
That is the life for me</i>

02:00:31.509 --> 02:00:33.509
<i>Cavorting and spawning
every morning</i>

02:00:33.759 --> 02:00:35.009
<i>Under the deep blue sea</i>

02:00:35.259 --> 02:00:38.884
<i>To have no fear for storm or gale
Oh to chase the tail of a whale</i>

02:00:39.134 --> 02:00:40.717
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine</i>

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:44.258
<i>That is the life for me</i>

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.717
You're 3 minutes over!

02:00:52.967 --> 02:00:54.050
It's the audience.

02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:55.342
Bow and finish.

02:00:55.592 --> 02:00:56.633
I've another act to do.

02:00:56.883 --> 02:01:00.425
Bow and finish!

02:01:18.467 --> 02:01:19.299
What am I to do?

02:01:19.549 --> 02:01:23.882
Just finish.
There are 15 other acts to follow.

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:34.174
Look, I've got Postant
on the telephone!

02:01:34.591 --> 02:01:37.174
Please, please.
Will you give me a chance?

02:01:37.424 --> 02:01:39.716
What's wrong?
Why isn't he doing an encore?

02:01:39.966 --> 02:01:42.424
I can't keep the other acts waiting.
They're complaining.

02:01:42.674 --> 02:01:46.882
That's your problem.
He does an encore.

02:01:55.299 --> 02:01:58.341
Do your encore!

02:08:25.539 --> 02:08:28.997
Mmm, you darling!

02:10:00.744 --> 02:10:02.285
- Here, take this.
- What is it?

02:10:02.535 --> 02:10:05.410
I have a terrific pain
in my back and chest.

02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:07.744
Dr. Blake is in the house.
Shall I get him?

02:10:07.994 --> 02:10:09.327
Yes, get him at once!

02:10:09.577 --> 02:10:11.535
- What's wrong?
- He's hurt his spine.

02:10:11.785 --> 02:10:14.119
- Did you send for the doctor?
- Yes.

02:10:14.369 --> 02:10:15.910
Then carry him
to his dressing room.

02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:18.619
I'll tell the audience
there's been an accident.

02:10:18.869 --> 02:10:20.785
No, don't do that!
Carry me on.

02:10:21.035 --> 02:10:25.160
I'll talk to them.
You'll ruin the evening.

02:10:40.784 --> 02:10:47.451
On behalf of my partner,
and myself...

02:10:48.201 --> 02:10:50.576
This is a wonderful evening.

02:10:50.826 --> 02:10:55.618
I'd like to continue,
but I'm stuck.

02:11:11.868 --> 02:11:13.409
Take off his makeup.

02:11:13.659 --> 02:11:14.951
Is there a couch
in his dressing room?

02:11:15.201 --> 02:11:16.701
No, but there's one
in the prop room.

02:11:16.951 --> 02:11:18.034
Take him in there.

02:11:18.283 --> 02:11:21.992
Everyone else must wait outside.

02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:33.575
Where's Calvero?
Where is the old scoundrel?

02:11:33.825 --> 02:11:36.658
I want to congratulate him.
Where's Calvero?

02:11:36.908 --> 02:11:40.325
In the prop room.
He's had an accident.

02:11:40.575 --> 02:11:42.158
Here's the doctor now.

02:11:42.408 --> 02:11:43.992
I want an ambulance at once.

02:11:44.242 --> 02:11:45.283
Is it serious, Doctor?

02:11:45.533 --> 02:11:47.617
Very. It isn't his back,
it's a heart attack.

02:11:47.867 --> 02:11:49.908
- Is he in pain?
- Not now. I've given him something.

02:11:50.158 --> 02:11:53.033
I'm afraid he won't last the night.

02:12:05.782 --> 02:12:07.324
What have they been telling you?

02:12:07.574 --> 02:12:09.741
Are you all right?

02:12:09.991 --> 02:12:12.491
Of course.

02:12:12.741 --> 02:12:15.241
I'm an old weed.

02:12:15.491 --> 02:12:20.074
The more I'm cut down,
the more I spring up again.

02:12:21.116 --> 02:12:23.866
Did you hear them?

02:12:25.657 --> 02:12:27.449
I don't mean the claque.

02:12:27.699 --> 02:12:29.449
Wonderful!

02:12:29.699 --> 02:12:33.199
That's how it used to be.

02:12:33.366 --> 02:12:37.574
That's how it's going to be
from now on.

02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:43.031
We're going to tour the world.

02:12:43.906 --> 02:12:46.323
I've got ideas.

02:12:46.573 --> 02:12:52.073
You doing ballet, and me comedy.

02:12:55.823 --> 02:13:00.948
And in the elegant melancholy
of twilight,

02:13:01.448 --> 02:13:03.656
he will tell you he loves you.

02:13:03.906 --> 02:13:08.073
It doesn't matter.
It's you I love.

02:13:08.323 --> 02:13:13.573
The heart and the mind...
what an enigma.

02:13:13.823 --> 02:13:18.280
Miss Thereza, you're on, please.

02:13:21.489 --> 02:13:25.114
I won't be long, my darling.

02:13:36.697 --> 02:13:40.239
I believe I'm dying, Doctor.

02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:44.905
But then, I don't know.
I've died so many times.

02:13:45.155 --> 02:13:47.697
Are you in pain?

02:13:47.947 --> 02:13:50.739
No more.

02:13:53.155 --> 02:13:56.114
Where is she?

02:13:56.197 --> 02:13:59.488
I want to see her dance.

02:13:59.488 --> 02:14:02.362
Wait a minute.

02:14:15.238 --> 02:14:18.154
Bring the couch into the wings.

02:14:18.404 --> 02:14:21.654
I must see about that ambulance.
