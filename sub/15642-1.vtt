00:01.080 --> 00:02.809
<i>Last</i> season on Hit the Floor...

00:02.960 --> 00:04.485
Ahsha, don't be late.

00:04.640 --> 00:06.130
<i>_</i> Oh, my God'
<i>â€œ</i> YQs! "

00:06.280 --> 00:08.726
- I'm one of them.
- The girls are not my responsibility.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.565
Ahsha is your responsibility.
She's your daughter.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.644
Having you back
is having an effect on me.

00:14.800 --> 00:18.521
You broke my heart.
We can never be together.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.047
- I can't do this anymore.
- Are you breaking up with me?

00:21.200 --> 00:24.329
This world is sucking you in.
Derek's just a part of it.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.521
Kyle Hart, I'm a Devil girl now.
I'll never pay my own rent again.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.365
- Who was that?
- My husband.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.000
Pete Davenport,
are you asking me out on a date?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.491
Yes, I am.

00:36.640 --> 00:40.326
I want to first thank my wife,
Olivia Vincent!

00:40.480 --> 00:43.086
The winner of the All-Star vote,

00:43.240 --> 00:45.686
Ahsha Hayes!

00:45.840 --> 00:47.729
This is where it gets fun.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.201
The drug test I took for the trade,
I failed.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.203
I tested positive for oxymetholone.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.050
I always knew what you could do.
I never thought you could do it to me.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.531
It says you own 10 percent
of the Devil Girls.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.011
You're fired.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.891
In 15 seconds,
I am burning this whole place down.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.931
I am so happy to introduce to you
our new director,

01:07.080 --> 01:08.969
original Devil Girl, Sloan Hayes.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.363
We're gonna be breaking ground
in Hollywood a week from today.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.285
None of those girls is safe,
including my daughter.

01:15.440 --> 01:21.083
As long as he's inside,
that man is a cancer.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.848
And I need to cut him out.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.884
I have practise in a half-hour.
So do you.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.361
I can get us to the arena in 20.

02:17.520 --> 02:22.481
And there's so, so much
you can do in ten minutes.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.287
And one, two, three.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.567
Jump it out and one.
And turn. Turn.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.084
Hit, hit!

02:49.760 --> 02:51.250
Tighter, people.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.761
Up. Turn. Turn.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.605
BK.

03:03.040 --> 03:07.329
I don't think we've met.
I'm Jelena Howard. Captain.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.767
Sloane Hayes, director.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.922
When I scheduled rehearsal for 9,

03:12.080 --> 03:14.606
I assumed I'd find everyone
in the studio.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.491
Sometimes we run routines
on the main court.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.689
Some days Olivia would be here
and some she wouldn't.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.440
Did you want to be with us
for every rehearsal?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.443
I'm glad everyone's here, actually.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.649
This is a great place for the group talk
I wanted to have.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.565
If you want to go stand
with the rest of the girls...

03:39.400 --> 03:44.566
Ladies, I am so proud to be starting
this journey with you today.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.731
Now, while I may be new to this job,
I am not new to this floor.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.645
I'm the first Devil Girl
to ever step foot on it.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.883
I don't know what you're used to,
but with me, we're a team.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.010
We look out for each other.
I have an open-door policy.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.848
This is a tough job you do,
in so many ways.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.606
So if you have any troubles

04:11.760 --> 04:16.402
or anything you want to talk about,
I'm here.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.846
Okay, girls, take five.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.524
- That was inspiring, if a bit unrealistic.
- How so?

04:31.600 --> 04:35.764
This is a business.
It can't be all kumbayas and rainbows.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.285
I know how you do business.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.570
We're breaking ground on
the new Hollywood arena.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.691
And what better way to dress it
than with a championship banner?

04:49.840 --> 04:52.081
I promise, Oscar,
I'll do everything I can.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.891
I have full confidence in you, Peter.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.761
But I'm taking out
a $30 million insurance policy.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.847
You remember that Ohio small forward
you were worried about?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.365
I figured out a solution.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.127
- I bought him.
- I am thrilled

05:11.280 --> 05:14.409
and humbled to be a part
of this amazing organisation.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.767
I know what it's like to win a ring.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.447
I just hope I can bring
some of that magic here to L.A.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.171
I'd like to thank the people
who brought me here.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.325
Jude, junior agent
and rock star at my agency.

05:27.480 --> 05:32.725
And God.
With him, all things are possible.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.003
- Really?
- Really.

05:37.640 --> 05:42.487
- Hey. Pete, Zero. Zero, Pete.
- Good to meet you.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.529
- Enjoy your game.
- Thank you.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.526
I just bought you a shiny
new sports car. Don't scratch it.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.609
Not now.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.924
Okay, I'm gone a week,
I come back and you're married?

06:01.080 --> 06:05.324
It's that old story. Boy meets girl, girl
strips at boy's club, girl marries boy,

06:05.480 --> 06:07.687
boy pulls a scam for
three quarters of a million dollars

06:07.840 --> 06:09.808
and goes to prison.
Don't get used it.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.407
Benny. I busted my ass to get him
sprung so I could get a divorce.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.085
That man is good for nothing.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.208
- Where is he now?
- In my bed.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.604
I tuckered him out, poor thing. I guess
he's not totally good for nothing.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.886
Speaking of, how are things
with you and Derek?

06:25.040 --> 06:27.327
You're the only one who knows.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.369
Don't get your panties in a twist.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.761
I understand the delicacy
of the situation.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.606
- How's the sex?
- How do you think it is?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.288
I'm jealous. Of Care Bear.
What the "F"?

06:42.560 --> 06:45.530
Tell me All-Stars was a disaster
at least.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.366
Girl, All-Stars was life-changing.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.091
I went for it
because I was pissed at Jelena,

06:52.240 --> 06:55.722
but being there,
being part of something that big,

06:55.880 --> 06:59.043
it made me see how far I've come
and how far I could go.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.645
I just have to focus.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.281
- All-Stars is over.
- Forget that whole jealous thing.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.887
You may have had a win,
but not "the" win.

07:14.640 --> 07:15.971
Welcome back.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.725
<i>Zero with the slam dunk!
This game is over!</i>

07:21.880 --> 07:24.121
Best news ever.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.124
I didn't realise
you were so invested in trades.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.601
They promoted me.
I'm running the Playground.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.604
Raquel, that is fantastic.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.728
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:34.880 --> 07:38.248
I have the matter of a rather large
bar bill we need to discuss.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.244
- We need to celebrate.
- Reservations at Urasawa?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.767
I had something else in mind.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.246
We haven't done this yet.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.641
I want our first time to be special.

07:56.800 --> 08:02.091
You respect me
and that is sweet and amazing.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.811
But what would be even more sweet
and amazing

08:06.960 --> 08:10.806
is if you took me right here,
right now.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.566
I don't know how you did it,
but gold star for bringing Zero to L.A.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.451
Got more than a gold star.
With Derek here already,

08:24.600 --> 08:27.809
the agency made me
their point person at the arena.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.248
I haven't always felt a hundred percent
welcome here on my own.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.008
Keep coming through for me like this,
that could change. Good job, kid.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.491
Thanks, Dad.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.650
Oscar.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.969
Thank you for coming.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.726
When the boss asks to see me,
I show up.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.322
So, where are you sleeping at night?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.687
You didn't bring me here
to talk about that.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.127
This is my relationship
with the girls now.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.044
It's not going to be with me.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.205
Ahsha, you're acting like
I'm asking you something crazy.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.931
What's crazy is someone
taking a job she's never wanted

09:20.080 --> 09:24.130
just to watch over her adult daughter.
Unless there's another reason

09:24.280 --> 09:26.851
you're sitting in that chair
I'm not getting.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.562
I would think you'd be happy
to have a little back-up with Jelena.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.085
That girl is nothing but--

09:33.240 --> 09:35.925
I've been dealing with Jelena
longer than you have.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.845
She's not my problem.
You're my problem.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.965
Oh, hello, dear.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

09:53.120 --> 09:57.091
Ahsha's mother.
I can already tell she's a bad fit.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.003
It shouldn't take too long
to put a hiring committee together.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.403
- In the meantime I can--
- Sloane Hayes isn't going anywhere.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.486
I'm part-owner of the Devil Girls.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.564
I should be able to make
personnel changes.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.406
Owning 10 percent of Apple
doesn't make you Steve Jobs.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.251
Or Steve Jobs' boss.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.050
Sloane is good press,
something that I need right now.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.921
She's in charge and you're
going to have to get used to it.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.570
<i>Her success is your success.</i>

10:26.720 --> 10:30.088
- With all due respect--
- I'm hearing a lot of things from you,

10:30.920 --> 10:33.321
but respect isn't one of them.

10:34.560 --> 10:39.407
I suggest that you not make me regret
giving you that 1O percent.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.568
You'll regret hiring her,
mark my words.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.289
Olivia.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.650
I really wish you'd talk to me.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.807
I know how you get
when you get upset.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.167
Okay. It's better to talk it out.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.127
Yeah, I tried my badge
in a couple of doors,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.089
but it doesn't have my clearances.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.083
That can take a couple of weeks.

11:58.240 --> 12:02.006
Is there any way to speed it up?
I mean, I gotta hit the ground running.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.242
A lot of stuff to catch up on.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.370
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.967
- Can I help you?
- Hi, German.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.848
- Ahsha's boyfriend.
- Ex.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.964
Right, sorry. Look, German,
I hate to be a bad guy here,

12:40.120 --> 12:43.124
but I just, just started
talking to Ahsha,

12:43.280 --> 12:46.807
so, you know, I don't want to
get involved in her business.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.606
Ahsha doesn't know that I'm here.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.201
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell her.

12:54.520 --> 12:58.570
- I'm here for me.
- Okay.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.850
I'm leaving L.A.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.324
I mean, with everything
that's gone down, I want...

13:07.800 --> 13:12.328
I need a change. I can get a job
as a high school coach anywhere,

13:12.480 --> 13:15.165
but seeing Ahsha
get what she wants...

13:16.120 --> 13:20.250
Well, it's making me want to go
after what I want too.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.246
That's great, but I don't see what I--

13:24.400 --> 13:27.483
You're the only one I know
with connections.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.565
Look, you don't know me
or owe me anything,

13:32.400 --> 13:36.325
but I'd be pissed at myself forever
if I didn't at least ask.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.847
I broke down some games.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.367
My resume's in there too.

13:46.520 --> 13:51.765
So if you felt like passing it along...
Thanks.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.210
German.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.003
Those Hayes women,
they can be tough.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.482
- Hi.
- Hello.

14:17.400 --> 14:22.201
- How was All-Stars?
- Good. Over.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.361
All I'm thinking about is a ring.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.682
A championship ring.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.567
And I'm going to get one.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.843
Well, bye.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.410
- The new guy's hot.
- You have terrible taste in men.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.364
- Are you jealous?
- Who? Jesus with a jump shot?

15:17.520 --> 15:19.966
I'm not jealous of him.
I am Derek Roman,

15:20.120 --> 15:23.044
with a big house,
so you have a permanent place to stay.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.850
- Permanent?
- You're homeless,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.480
you've been crashing at my place.
Why not stay?

15:27.640 --> 15:30.120
- I can't.
- Why not?

15:30.760 --> 15:34.606
- Because I'm living with Kyle.
- You're what?

15:37.880 --> 15:40.247
She's living with me.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.243
Relax, boys.
It's nothing I haven't seen before.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.404
- Isn't that...?
- My wife.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.364
What are you doing here?

16:10.520 --> 16:14.286
I'll be in your seats at the next game.
I know how under your skin I am,

16:14.440 --> 16:16.647
so I wanted to give you a heads-up
so I didn't throw off your game off.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.168
You're not under anyone's skin.
What's your angle?

16:20.320 --> 16:23.210
You hate basketball.
The only thing you love

16:23.360 --> 16:26.443
besides seeing yourself on a screen
is screwing with me.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.366
First, I don't hate basketball.
Hate implies investment. I'm apathetic.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.885
Second, get over yourself.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.247
They're showing a tease
of my new movie during the broadcast.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.687
The porn?
That doesn't come out for months.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.286
It's not a porn,
it's a psycho-sexual drama

16:39.440 --> 16:41.602
that's based on
a bestselling book series.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.649
Full frontal?

16:44.600 --> 16:47.649
Until our divorce papers are signed,
those seats are 50 percent mine.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.131
Then you can have one.

16:49.280 --> 16:53.001
Good. One's all I need.
Good to see I'm not under your skin.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.769
He's the number two guy in Ohio.
Why come here for the same money?

17:04.920 --> 17:06.922
From a team
he won a championship with.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.763
Maybe guy likes the beach.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.404
Hey, guys.

17:14.079 --> 17:18.165
Listen, SportsCenter wants to do
this thing on me.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.607
Would you be okay doing it with me?

17:21.280 --> 17:24.762
They want you alone
and you're asking us to do it with you?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.730
Egos were crazy back in Ohio.
I need a team.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.451
Unless your press guys
only want you doing solos,

17:30.600 --> 17:32.762
in which case I totally get it.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.083
- I'm down.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.211
- Devils Nation, rise up.
- Okay, Zero.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.450
- You looking for someone?
- No.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.605
Hey, can you spot me? Every act of
goodwill is a step towards salvation.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.851
I don't do saving.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.890
I follow a life
in the way of salvation

18:06.040 --> 18:08.407
in the midst of the paths
of righteousness.

18:08.560 --> 18:13.168
"I lead in the way of righteousness,
in the midst of the paths ofjudgement."

18:14.280 --> 18:18.888
You're a fraud. Other people
might not see through you, but I do.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.966
I'm just trying to get
the most out of life.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.930
The most endorsements.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.801
You are without a doubt the sexiest
woman I've ever laid eyes on.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.521
It would be an honour to get
to know you. In the Biblical sense.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.526
You're not just a fraud, you're suicidal.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.481
Do you even know
who I'm the girlfriend of?

18:41.560 --> 18:43.005
I'm new around here.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.926
Well, in addition to the Bible, you might
want to study the team roster.

18:47.680 --> 18:52.288
Besides, I'm way too much woman
for you.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.724
Wrong.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.930
Ex-girlfriend.

19:18.640 --> 19:22.531
- What can I say? I don't want you to go.
- You just like being able to get it 24/7.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.489
What would your other girls say
if I were living here?

19:24.640 --> 19:28.326
There aren't any other girls.
There haven't been for two weeks.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.451
If someone found out I was staying
here permanently, I could lose my job.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.051
It's too big a risk.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.201
Is that the only risk
you're talking about?

19:37.360 --> 19:41.410
My job isn't enough? I have to go.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.447
Why wouldn't you want
to live with Derek?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.604
He's going to buy you so many things.
Expensive things.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.481
So many expensive things. And he has
the attention span of a fruit fly.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.971
Grab everything
while the window is open.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.963
See? That's what I'm worried about.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.805
Derek is not a one-woman man.
I have his interest,

20:06.960 --> 20:10.043
but what happens after
his attention span runs out?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.806
I've barely put myself back together
after German.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.566
- I can't handle another heartbreak.
- Be careful.

20:15.720 --> 20:19.611
The best advice I ever got was the
earliest, "Watch where you're walking."

20:19.840 --> 20:21.808
After "don't put that in your mouth".

20:24.400 --> 20:26.289
Excuse me.

20:26.440 --> 20:29.728
Benny, can you tell your friend
to keep his hands off my stuff?

20:29.880 --> 20:32.201
- Benny's not here.
- Where'd he go?

20:32.360 --> 20:35.762
- To buy a pack of cigs.
- Benny doesn't smoke.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.646
You mean he's "gone" gone?
He took off.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.922
- Are you his friend?
- I'm his loan officer. The name's Beau.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.051
How much did he borrow?

20:54.200 --> 20:59.001
Enough to pay the rest of
his way out of prison. 350 thousand.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.403
You must really want him back.
Yeah, I wish I could help,

21:02.560 --> 21:06.007
but every time that man took off,
I could never track him down.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.290
Actually, you're the one that I want.
You got a reputation, Kyle Hart.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.202
I'm moving my friend in right now,
which is really special to me.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.442
Flavoured international coffee special.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.082
Give me your number
and I'll call you later, how about that?

21:22.240 --> 21:25.847
If you're as smart as they say you are,
you're gonna call me tonight.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.568
Bye, now.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.969
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, Chase, buddy. Come here.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.044
Why am I hearing that Olivia
is planning on showing up

21:50.200 --> 21:54.489
- at the groundbreaking Thursday?
- Who told you that?

21:55.360 --> 21:59.843
It wasn't my new EVP of Business
Operations, that's for damn sure.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.840
- I can explain.
- Let me save you the effort.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.800
If she shows up
and does something stupid,

22:07.960 --> 22:11.009
I'm holding you personally
responsible, do you understand?

22:17.160 --> 22:20.209
- I'm handling it.
- That's not what I asked.

22:25.360 --> 22:29.922
- I understand.
- Drink up.

22:38.280 --> 22:43.525
Lionel, she was a one-night stand
that lasted 10 years.

22:43.680 --> 22:49.528
I was a baller, she was an actress.
Everybody ate it up.

22:49.680 --> 22:55.050
Then she went A-list, I got injured
and the whole thing went to crap.

22:56.960 --> 23:03.650
I knew, though. I knew
the minute I cooled, so would she.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.761
- Why'd you marry her?
- I have no idea.

23:11.720 --> 23:16.089
I was chasing a feeling
that I lost a long time ago.

23:21.680 --> 23:25.241
German stopped by to see me.
He didn't come to talk about you.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.641
- He's leaving L.A.
- He's...?

23:29.800 --> 23:33.282
Yeah, he wanted me to recommend him
to some other teams.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.286
I looked at his scouting reports.
They're good.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.805
- Really good.
- Yeah?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.361
I'd actually hate for another team
to get him.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.410
Look, I haven't discussed this
with him yet and I won't

23:45.560 --> 23:48.689
if you have any hesitation at all,

23:48.840 --> 23:53.767
but how would you feel if I offered him
an assisting coach position?

23:53.920 --> 23:55.684
Lowest level.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.321
I can't get in the way of German
going after what he wants.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.801
He didn't do that to me.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.681
Thank you for asking me.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.163
If you want to do it, I'm okay with it.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.326
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.611
Hold on.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.606
- Kincade, that's our owner's name.
- I'm Jude. His son.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.561
- Oscar has kids?
- Kid, singular. Never mentioned me?

24:41.040 --> 24:44.408
- Well, we don't really hang out.
- From his first marriage.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.291
This one's on the house.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.885
Jude Kincade. I know who you are.
Big fan of your movies.

25:04.040 --> 25:08.170
- Really? Which one's your favourite?
- <i>Eight Ball.</i>

25:08.320 --> 25:10.527
You were robbed at the Oscars.

25:10.680 --> 25:14.366
You're actually why I'm here.
I saw your name on the list for tonight.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.524
I wanted to invite you
to all the games this season.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.284
Having a star of your calibre

25:19.440 --> 25:22.967
supporting the team on a regular basis
would make Oscar very happy.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.442
And making Oscar happy
would make me happy.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.682
This appearance is one-night only.

25:28.840 --> 25:33.164
Hearing "no" in life makes me want
to hear "yes" more. Think about it.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.684
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.528
You're nervous.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.251
I can't afford for my first at-bat
to be my last.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.528
Baseball metaphors
in a basketball arena.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.728
That should get you fired right there.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.610
Look, I don't want to try to not
bump into you all day.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.922
I don't want it to be like that.

26:10.080 --> 26:13.766
Just because things ended
the way they ended...

26:15.200 --> 26:18.921
I'm not angry at you
and I hope you're not angry at me.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.204
I'm not.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.287
It's just--
It's gonna be weird for a while.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.885
" Okay?
" Okay

26:32.400 --> 26:35.768
I'm here to support my movie
and my team. They both have my heart.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.763
Excuse me.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.043
Sloane, right?

26:44.960 --> 26:46.291
And you're Lionel.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.045
It must be so exciting
being back in the arena.

26:51.200 --> 26:55.967
- Yes, back with the girls.
- It's not exactly what I meant.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.725
"Pete and Sloane" was ages ago.
I've moved on and so has Pete.

27:05.240 --> 27:09.290
- Good luck with your cheerleaders.
- We don't call them that anymore.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.410
- They're dancers.
- Great.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.370
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together</i>

27:15.520 --> 27:19.047
<i>for the Los Angeles Devil Girls.</i>

27:19.200 --> 27:22.647
<i>And we're back to the '90s
with original Devil Girl</i>

27:22.800 --> 27:24.529
<i>Sloane Hayes in the house.</i>

29:44.360 --> 29:47.682
Nice job, ladies. Beautiful.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.443
Great job. Wonderful job.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.131
Sloane. Amazing job.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.282
I couldn't be happier
having you back.

29:59.440 --> 30:03.445
Thank you.
That means so much to me.

30:06.680 --> 30:10.048
- You're welcome.
- Let's cut the crap.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.801
I know you like to play games.

30:16.960 --> 30:22.251
Olivia may have batted the ball around
with you, but understand this.

30:22.400 --> 30:27.201
- I am not Olivia.
- You're not.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.690
Olivia knew what she was doing.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.525
You're going to screw up,

30:32.680 --> 30:38.528
and the minute you do,
Oscar's going to hear about it.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.969
Have a good night.

30:49.560 --> 30:53.167
<i>Six seconds on the clock.
Inbound pass to Zero. Spin move.</i>

30:53.320 --> 30:58.565
<i>He loses his man. Takes off.
Slam dunk, Devils win, 103 to 101!</i>

31:02.760 --> 31:07.049
- Congrats on the win.
- Who were we playing?

31:07.200 --> 31:10.010
If I had known
there was gonna be a quiz...

31:10.160 --> 31:14.210
Sorry for the wait, my staff is
swamped. What can I get you?

31:14.360 --> 31:18.331
A martini, extra dirty.
And my husband will take a Jack rocks.

31:23.760 --> 31:27.765
- You're sleeping with her.
- You're crazy.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.566
- Oh, it's more serious than that.
- And we're done.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.129
Have you considered my request
after that super-exciting win?

31:42.280 --> 31:44.567
I couldn't consider
coming to any more games

31:44.720 --> 31:47.451
if my husband is screwing
a Playground employee.

31:49.400 --> 31:53.007
We're still married. Do you know
what kind of press I'd get for that?

31:53.160 --> 31:56.369
- Me in the stands, him in her bed?
- Her and Pete Davenport?

31:56.520 --> 31:59.569
It's a problem. And for you
if you want me at the games.

31:59.720 --> 32:04.362
- Don't worry, I'm on it.
- We'll see.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.126
The lead scorer of the night,
my man.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.131
- You okay?
- I'm great.

32:27.440 --> 32:32.651
I've thought about it.
And yes, I will accept that date.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.204
You Will?

32:43.520 --> 32:46.091
I never leave
without getting what I want.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.561
You should know
I don't care what you want.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.051
Or what you heard of me.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.125
If Benny owes you 350K,
it's not my problem.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.886
- You're his wife.
- Worst mistake of my life.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.691
Just like lending him money
was the worst mistake of yours.

32:59.840 --> 33:03.731
You raised hundreds of thousands
of dollars to spring him all by yourself.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.929
- And I got nothing to show for it.
- Not true.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.810
- What's that?
- Divorce papers.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.531
Benny signed them,
asked me to give them to you.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.207
Which I'd be happy to do.
But you've got to pay off his debt first.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.204
Are you drooling?

33:22.560 --> 33:25.848
Okay, so how am I supposed to
come up with 350 grand?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.731
- That's a correction. "We."
- I work alone.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.442
There's a first time for everything.
You want your divorce or don't you?

33:33.600 --> 33:38.242
So how do "we" think we're going
to come up with 350 grand?

33:38.400 --> 33:42.928
Who are these dudes with
the dollar signs on their names?

33:43.080 --> 33:48.120
High rollers that come to games.
I like to roll with them.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.250
Yeah, seems like
a damn good place to start.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.928
The MRI shows your tibial
stress fracture has gotten worse.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.687
I told you to sit out for six weeks.
Now you need surgery.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.284
How long would the surgery
take me out?

34:21.440 --> 34:23.920
Four months max,
with proper rest and rehab.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.081
This is my best chance at a ring.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.605
I've got Derek and now Zero.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.206
It could be now or never for me.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.326
- What's option B?
- There is no option B.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.125
If you keep playing,
you're risking a major fracture.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.806
You could blow out your knee
completely.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.210
It will end your career.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.047
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.566
- German Vega?
- Yeah.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.809
Here you go. Sign here.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.570
Have a good night.

35:43.800 --> 35:49.523
I came here to end this.
Whatever this is.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.968
If people found out about us,
that would be it for me.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.762
That would be it.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.604
But I can't. I can't do it.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.884
I want what I want, and I want you.

36:14.640 --> 36:19.965
It's not smart, it's not sane,
but I'm not willing to give it up.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.851
Not before I know what it is.

36:25.640 --> 36:29.531
I will do this,
but we have to keep it a secret.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.166
Can you do that?

37:01.680 --> 37:05.605
Security told me they were keeping
an eye out for Chase's wife. I will too.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.366
- Who asked you to do that?
- You shouldn't have to ask.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.411
You also didn't ask me to get Lionel
Davenport for the rest of the season.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.201
- But I'm close.
- Lionel. Really?

37:21.840 --> 37:25.640
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
associates,

37:25.800 --> 37:28.406
city councilmen and women.

37:28.560 --> 37:33.771
Thank you all so much for coming
to the birth of my baby.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.084
They say it takes a village...

37:37.240 --> 37:38.924
How long did you think
you could pull it off?

37:39.080 --> 37:42.846
- Pull what off?
- Milking this All-Stars thing.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.321
Being here for this? You?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.884
I hope it wasn't strange
dancing in a different uniform.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.407
You might have to get used to it.

37:53.760 --> 37:57.890
You've been trying to chase me away
for months now. I'm still here.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.123
I don't know what you think
is suddenly gonna be different.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.206
Oh, something is different.

38:05.680 --> 38:10.288
Sometimes the worst thing
you can do to someone

38:11.120 --> 38:13.726
is hurt the person
they love the most.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.008
And so it is with great pride

38:16.160 --> 38:19.369
that I break ground on
the Devils' new state-of-the-art

38:19.520 --> 38:23.241
no-expense-spared
Hollywood arena.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.529
Olivia.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.284
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor...</i>

38:50.440 --> 38:54.001
You may not feel anything, Jelena,
but Olivia was murdered.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.650
Don't presume to know how I feel.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.167
Anyone divulging Devils business
will be dealt with.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.651
Dancers can't date players,

38:59.800 --> 39:01.848
so when we're outside of your house,
there's no "us".

39:02.000 --> 39:03.411
Dinner at the Ivy?

39:05.160 --> 39:07.322
Seems you've zeroed in
on someone new.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.811
- Sloane?
- What about her?

39:08.960 --> 39:11.247
I heard she was pretty wild.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.811
My wife was an amazing woman,

39:12.960 --> 39:15.042
and I'm gonna make sure
whoever did this

39:15.200 --> 39:17.043
feels the pain I'm going through.
