02:48.101 --> 02:49.202
Why?

03:03.983 --> 03:07.387
-Spit it out! I want to go back to bed.
-Okay, obviously, this isn't easy.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.333
Explain to me why you saw this a******.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.024
What an idiot you are.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.334
-This is, like, good news. I know, but…
-I don't want to hear this b*******.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.413
<i>Okay, to give you
a real brief explanation…</i>

09:40.479 --> 09:43.516
-Okay.<i>
-It's a mixture of relevant questions</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:44.850
<i>and irrelevant questions.</i>

09:44.917 --> 09:48.287
<i>Like, if I was testing you,
Kim, my first question would be,</i>

09:48.354 --> 09:50.089
<i>"Is your first name Kim?"</i>

09:50.156 --> 09:51.824
<i>Now I have a pretty good baseline</i>

09:51.891 --> 09:53.893
<i>of what you look like
on known truthful questions.</i>

09:56.862 --> 09:58.531
<i>Yeah. And then give me a call,</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:00.666
<i>and I'll write them all out
and we'll be all set.</i>

19:18.957 --> 19:19.958
Thank you.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.861
This is amazing.
Have you ever met Dr. Sands?

20:11.310 --> 20:13.111
I'm giving him some narcotics now.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.482
How do you feel?

20:20.419 --> 20:23.055
You guys got the coolest jobs
in the world.

20:24.022 --> 20:27.459
You guys like,
you make millions of dollars a year.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.461
-You're in Beverly Hills.
-That's where I'll fly.

20:31.163 --> 20:35.133
You walk outside, you get probably
some of the best sandwiches in the world.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.690
I think that we can…

21:57.482 --> 21:59.484
-I am high.
-You are high?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.254
Thank you.

22:04.756 --> 22:09.294
My grandma always used to tell me
I have nice teeth.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.488
We're BFF now.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.937
Damn.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.839
-What? Don't keep touching it.
-I feel like I accomplished something.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.147
Talk to Rob about his bald.

38:34.845 --> 38:36.447
I was a pretty boy.
