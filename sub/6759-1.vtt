01:46.981 --> 01:48.774
(Phone rings)

01:52.028 --> 01:53.195
Yeah.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.488
Oh.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.323
Oh, Jesus, no.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.950
This isn't a good time.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.703
(Sheriff) Rick?

02:03.039 --> 02:05.457
- Mr Carver?
- Yeah, I'll be with you in a second.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.460
Huh? Well, I'll tell you what you do.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.172
Remove the meter, turn the water off,
and let them sweat for a couple of days.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.216
Then you ride in
on your white fucking horse,

02:14.342 --> 02:16.093
tell them you have a cash buyer

02:16.219 --> 02:18.470
and Richard Carver
can approve a short sale.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.098
You want me to spell it for you?
R-I-C...

02:21.224 --> 02:24.643
OK, well, I can't hold your hand
while you give them a hand job, Bill.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.645
Just get me the property.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.316
Yes, John, Officer Dudura, you have
my court order signed by the judge.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.068
What can I do for you?

02:33.194 --> 02:35.237
You're the bank's realtor
on this eviction.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.699
I need an official statement.
What happened and why?

02:38.825 --> 02:41.743
Well, Dudura, it's a real shame
cos we arrived here with two pizzas

02:41.870 --> 02:44.163
for Mr Kadwell, the property owner,

02:44.289 --> 02:46.165
but he didn't want anchovies,

02:46.291 --> 02:48.750
so he went into the house,
pulled out a gun

02:48.877 --> 02:51.044
and he blew his brains out.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.506
And that set off Mrs Kadwell
who was expecting Chinese for dinner.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.093
You're talking about a man
who just killed himself.

03:01.764 --> 03:05.017
I am the last man who knocked
on Patrick Kadwell's door,

03:05.143 --> 03:06.643
in his life.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.979
That is his wife of 15 years, Samantha,

03:09.105 --> 03:11.648
his daughters,
Dylan, six, Paige, 11.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.568
What official statement
can encapsulate

03:14.694 --> 03:17.487
the tragic absurdity
of this fucked-up situation?

03:17.614 --> 03:20.407
I can't bring him back to life.
Stop wasting my time.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.868
(Phone rings)

03:22.994 --> 03:24.036
Yeah?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.621
No, I'm fine, honey.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.832
Turn the TV off,
keep the girls away from the internet.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.042
Er...

03:30.168 --> 03:32.044
I got a call. Yeah.

03:32.837 --> 03:33.921
Hello?

03:34.672 --> 03:36.632
No, no, no.
You ride that up to 200.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.468
220 tops.
No more than 10% down.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.179
7.5% makes me sing.
Get the Miguels ready.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.097
It's two grand a month
in interest alone.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.183
We got to flip this thing.
Get back to me.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.268
(Beep)

03:48.394 --> 03:50.938
- Call office.
- (Dialling tone)

03:51.064 --> 03:53.523
Have we got anything else, boss?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.401
Next eviction's Tuesday.
Natalia will call you.

03:56.527 --> 03:57.736
Roger that.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.451
- (Natalia) 'Rick Carver Realty.'
- Talk to me. My world's upside down.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.537
'I'm emailing your revised itinerary.
And Jerry called again...'

04:07.664 --> 04:09.498
Jerry's full of shit.
Keep talking.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.501
'The Sutton Place high-rise came up.
The UD's in order.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.254
'What do you want me to tell Elliot?'

04:15.380 --> 04:18.257
(Samantha) No, no!

04:23.972 --> 04:25.264
Please!

04:47.370 --> 04:50.455
Yo, Nash, you can stop working now.
We're done. We're done.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.999
- What?
- Hey!

04:53.126 --> 04:55.002
Listen up!

04:55.128 --> 04:56.586
(Speaks Spanish)

04:57.755 --> 04:59.965
The buyer didn't qualify.
We're shut down.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.217
- What about payment?
- We don't get paid.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.177
For two weeks
we've been working for free.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.264
All this from roof to cement
is for nothing.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.182
- Stop working!
- (Hammering)

05:09.309 --> 05:10.809
Put the hammer down, man.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.562
Unplug everything, wrap it up.
Let's go home.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.980
No dinero.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.692
That looks like the United States
upside down, but flipped this way.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.570
- It actually does.
- (Dennis) Connor?

05:21.696 --> 05:22.904
Connor!

05:23.573 --> 05:25.699
- We were just looking at the countries.
- Connor!

05:25.825 --> 05:28.702
- We're naming the countries.
- It's our time. We're up.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.454
- Gotta go.
- See you.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.788
Bye.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.708
Who was that?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.044
- Who was that?
- That's my friend Alex from school.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.340
- You dropped this.
- Good catch.

05:41.466 --> 05:45.010
Your Honour, he missed three payments
and is underwater over 80 grand.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.721
The bank can have a buyer in place
within 30 days.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.058
- Did you in fact miss three payments?
- Yes, sir, but I was told to.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.436
Two departments at the same bank
were telling me opposing things

05:54.562 --> 05:57.647
and then, just recently,
I got a final notice for eviction.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.567
(Lawyer) We'd like to get
this property off the market.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.779
- I see no reason to hold up the sale.
- They told me not to pay.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.491
And that's why I'm behind.
They told me not to pay.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.328
While I sympathise with your situation
I have 40,000 cases like this

06:11.454 --> 06:12.913
backed up behind yours.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.541
Final judgment granted.
I'm ordering you to vacate the premises.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.170
That's my family home, Your Honour.
I was born and raised in that home.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.924
He was born and raised there too.
He's my son, Connor.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.510
Please don't do this.
We've lived there our whole lives.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.137
My mum runs her business
out of that home.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.348
That's our second source
of income right now.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.974
- Is this your son?
- That's my son.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.684
He should be in school and not here.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.937
He's gonna lose his school,
with all due respect.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.190
Sun United Bank versus R. Rogers.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.904
- Give me a bit more time, please.
- Please remove Mr Nash.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.448
Your Honour, I just need a bit more time.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.118
I need a bit more time.
Excuse me for a second.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.036
(Bailiff) I need you to follow me now.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.747
(Judge) You have 30 days
to file an appeal.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.834
- Bailiff, please remove Mr Nash.
- I need you to follow me now, sir.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.419
Right now.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.722
Where are we going to stay
if we lose our home?

07:15.852 --> 07:18.353
- We're not gonna lose the home, bud.
- How do you know?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.148
The cops are coming back.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.733
I just wanna know
how you're gonna pay for it.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.110
Connor.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.450
Connor, I'm gonna figure it out, OK?

07:31.576 --> 07:34.661
That judge gave us 30 days.
Ain't no one taking the home from us.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.706
I'm gonna win this.
I'm gonna figure it out, simple as that.

07:37.832 --> 07:38.915
We're good.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.308
(Dennis) One hour.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.188
Hey, Bo.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.691
I got that new blade for your skill saw.
I'll bring it over tonight.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.610
- OK.
- You be careful, Connor.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.862
- Got a new scooter?
- Yeah.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.531
(Dennis) Hey, Mum.
(Lynn) So, tell me everything.

08:11.657 --> 08:15.702
- Did they give you a lawyer?
- Mum, it's the same story.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.830
Same story with the bank guys.
It's the same story everywhere we go.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.457
We have to find a lawyer.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.627
I'm just trying to understand
what this 30-day thing means.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.588
Does that mean the eviction's
not gonna happen tomorrow?

08:26.714 --> 08:30.425
- The judge told you. It's 30 days.
- 30 days to file for an appeal.

08:30.551 --> 08:34.304
It's a judge, it's not a bartender.
We're in good shape.

08:34.429 --> 08:37.807
My name is Dennis Nash
and I'm looking for representation.

08:37.933 --> 08:41.144
I understand that you guys
sometimes do not need a retainer.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.982
When you went through
what you went through,

08:46.108 --> 08:49.069
you found someone pro bono.
I'm wondering if he's gonna help...

08:49.195 --> 08:53.782
Lost is to found
as outside is to indoors, inside...

08:53.908 --> 08:56.701
And what's another example?
Here you go.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.495
- Have some salad.
- Black and white.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.413
Black and white.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.165
What's another one?
Give me one more.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.962
4540189.
Please give us a call back.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.764
I don't know
what to say to him sometimes.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.100
I was so young when I had you.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.895
I feel like you've had to raise me.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.360
You know just what to say.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.750
(lndistinct chat)

09:46.877 --> 09:49.421
Borrow against Blair Street
to cover Via Alizar.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.755
(Natalia) 'Good.'

09:50.881 --> 09:54.092
- I'll flip that this quarter.
- 'And London at Code Enforcement?'

09:54.802 --> 09:58.638
I got a short sale for that cocksucker.
I'll email you the details.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.223
- 'OK.'
- All right.

10:00.349 --> 10:04.019
(Sheriff) Afternoon, boss.
Love the new ride.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.897
- Range Rover HSE.
- Is this the Nash eviction?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.275
Yeah. Anyone home?

10:10.401 --> 10:14.613
I'm not sure, but his vehicle is home,
so I'm assuming he is.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.867
All right, let's get to it.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.079
- Morning, y'all.
- How's it going?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.348
(Sheriff) He's at the window.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.808
(Banging on door)

10:43.934 --> 10:46.227
Sheriff's department.
Come to the door.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.323
- What?
- Sheriffs are here.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.408
(Banging on door)

11:01.494 --> 11:03.161
Why are they here?

11:04.372 --> 11:06.665
(Banging on door)

11:06.791 --> 11:08.708
- You need to come to the door.
- He saw you.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.379
They saw you through the window.
Just answer it. We just got to explain it.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.381
Oh, come on.
Don't fucking do this.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.965
(Banging at door)

11:17.885 --> 11:19.344
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.971
I'm Deputy Anderson
with the Sheriff's department.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.307
We're here to serve you
a court-ordered eviction.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.309
- OK, well...
- So, ma'am,

11:26.435 --> 11:29.521
do you have any weapons on your body
or anywhere in the house?

11:29.647 --> 11:32.440
- No, no, no, no. Not us.
- Mr Carver?

11:32.566 --> 11:34.442
Good morning.
My name's Rick Carver.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.070
- I'm a licensed real estate broker.
- (Dennis) Mr Carver.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.238
Hi. Lynn.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.573
And, er, I'm very sorry to tell you

11:40.700 --> 11:44.411
that this home has been foreclosed on
and officially transferred to the bank.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.456
- I need you to vacate the premises.
- I understand what you're saying.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.916
And I've... I've... I've...

11:50.042 --> 11:51.876
We've been getting
our eviction notices.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.003
I was in court yesterday

11:54.130 --> 11:57.298
and the judge informed me
that I got 30 days

11:57.425 --> 11:59.843
to file for an appeal
and that's what I intend to do.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.930
If you have an emergency stay signed
by the judge, you're welcome to remain.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.642
I got a question. You guys didn't get
any rescheduling of the eviction date?

12:07.768 --> 12:10.270
What I've received is a court order
signed by a judge.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.189
It says you are to vacate
these premises today.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.067
- We were scared of this.
- This home is owned by the bank.

12:16.193 --> 12:20.155
- This is the information that we have.
- And we're sorry to waste your time.

12:20.281 --> 12:24.367
My office offered you a $3500
cash-or-keys settlement from the bank

12:24.493 --> 12:27.704
which would have given you time
to vacate the premises and you refused.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.247
- Yes, sir.
- We didn't refuse.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.750
- We tried to save our home.
- We were trying to save it.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.127
This is a very painful time, I know.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.881
It's a difficult thing to carry through on,
for me as well.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.176
But the time has come.
You have to leave your property.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.887
You are trespassing right now.
You are breaking the law.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.639
Sir, this is our home
so we just need a few minutes.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.768
We're going in circles here
so I'll let the sheriffs take care of it.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.436
- Randy?
- All right, sir.

12:51.562 --> 12:55.523
We've got a judge, sir,
and a lawyer who told us we can stay.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.901
- Is this your mum?
- Yeah, this is my mum.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.029
I'm gonna need you and your mum
to step off the property now.

13:01.155 --> 13:05.492
You know what? If you all can
come back tomorrow same time

13:05.618 --> 13:08.495
and if we don't have the papers,
we don't have the proof,

13:08.621 --> 13:10.455
- then we will leave.
- We have a lawyer.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.541
- We got it all figured out.
- Just give us a day.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.835
We can dance together,
but we can't talk together.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.713
- OK. All right, sir, we need a day.
- Do not close the door.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.174
- We need a day.
- Listen, this is what I'm gonna do.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.259
- Do not close the door.
- We need a day.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.387
- This is my home. I can do what I want.
- I will give you two minutes

13:26.514 --> 13:28.473
to pack whatever belongings you need

13:28.599 --> 13:32.185
- Cash, chequebook, medicines.
- No, this is not happening.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.771
- Yeah, this is happening.
- No, this is not happening.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.649
I'm getting my cell phone
so I can get the lawyer on the phone.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.944
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- Excuse me, sir.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.780
- I'm just walking by, sir.
- I don't know what this is.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.616
We can't let someone out of our sight
once we start an eviction.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.827
- Please don't come into my house.
- Listen to me.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.120
There are two ways
that we can do this.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.290
Right? An easy way which is
you do what you're told when asked.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.252
The other way is
that I take you and your mum to jail.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.878
Do you want
your mum to go to jail?

13:59.004 --> 14:01.673
What I'd like you to do
is take advantage of the two minutes,

14:01.799 --> 14:02.882
gather what you need,

14:03.008 --> 14:05.718
cash, cheque books, medicines,
things that you need...

14:05.845 --> 14:09.013
Excuse me, sir, would you mind
stepping outside of the property?

14:09.139 --> 14:12.475
Listen to me, sir.
Let me put it to you this way.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.644
- Excuse me.
- This isn't your home, son.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.479
(Dennis) Mr Carver?
(Lynn) Excuse me.

14:16.605 --> 14:20.650
- Mr Carver?
- According to Florida statute 801.08

14:20.776 --> 14:24.028
- I have the authority...
- Sir, we have the right to an attorney.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.447
(Lynn) Right? Then why
are you coming into our house?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.867
Somebody forgot to call you,
we don't get a lawyer?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.785
It's better not to get emotional, ma'am.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.913
- You're kicking us out of our house.
- Please, OK? Please!

14:34.039 --> 14:36.124
(Sheriff) Ma'am,
please don't ask questions.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.585
- Please!
- Enough of this. Let's go.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.837
Get what you need to get,
then you need to go.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.465
- Let's go. No more of this.
- (Lyn) Sir, I don't need your help.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.259
OK? I can take a minute.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.761
Do you need to follow a woman
into her bedroom?

14:52.182 --> 14:54.350
I got a full house here.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.729
I'm gonna have to be late
to the next one. I know.

14:57.855 --> 15:01.149
It's just department policy.
Money, chequebook.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.110
- Things like wallets, pictures.
- I'm trying to get pictures!

15:04.236 --> 15:06.112
- Does he have to stand there?
- Yes, sir.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.532
He has to fucking stand there
while she packs up her underwear?

15:09.658 --> 15:10.700
Is that right?

15:10.826 --> 15:13.620
(Lynn) Dennis, please!
(Sheriff) It's policy.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.005
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.507
I got to keep you in my sight, ma'am.
Sorry about that.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.804
Anyway, ma'am, just take
the most important things.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.064
What else, Mum?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.693
Can I ask if it says two minutes
on your clipboard?

15:45.819 --> 15:48.529
(Rick) The two minutes is a courtesy.
Let her take the plant.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.615
- You don't need it.
- The two minutes is what?

15:50.741 --> 15:52.200
- A courtesy.
- (Lynn) Oh, my God!

15:52.326 --> 15:54.035
You're trespassing right now.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.913
I know it's painful to hear it,
but it's the truth.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.749
(Lynn) This is our home.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.504
- Oh, my God.
- Anything else, ma'am?

16:04.630 --> 16:05.922
Oh, my toaster.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.050
My toaster oven
to make toast for my grandson.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.760
Uh-huh. Ma'am.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.978
(Lynn) Dennis! Did you get
your chequebook out of the desk?

16:20.104 --> 16:23.398
- You said the two minutes was up.
- (Dennis) We're getting the bills.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.525
- All right, let's go.
- (Lynn) Dennis?

16:26.860 --> 16:29.404
(Lynn) His basketball, his basketball.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.489
Will you just let her go in
and get the ball?

16:31.615 --> 16:34.033
Right, Jeff, get to it.
Rhonda, get the locks.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.494
(Lynn) Hey, what about the rest?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.579
(Rick) They're gonna
bring everything out.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.081
There's no need to worry.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.419
You mind helping me move all this
to the other side of the sidewalk?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.462
We're moving it, OK?
Just give us a second.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.425
Now, my advice would be
to get a moving truck

16:50.551 --> 16:52.510
cos your neighbours
are gonna have access

16:52.636 --> 16:54.721
to everything you own
by the end of the day.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.181
(Dennis) I got it.
(Lynn) Can you believe this?

16:58.392 --> 17:01.728
They cancelled it and then
they didn't even tell these guys.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.064
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.398
Oh, my God.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.902
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I can't believe this is happening.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.911
Hey!

17:19.038 --> 17:21.079
- What are you doing?
- Moving stuff.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.499
Don't go in there.
You got no business going in there.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.960
- Shut the lid.
- All right, keep your pants on.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.308
- I'll take him next door.
- OK.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.934
- OK?
- OK.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.022
- (Lynn) Hey, buddy.
- What are they doing?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.732
- Nothing.
- This is our house.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.525
- This is our house.
- It's OK.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.861
- (Rick) Son, where are you heading?
- Get off me!

17:51.987 --> 17:53.529
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get away from him.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.531
- Get away from him.
- This is our house.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.868
It's a very difficult situation.
Please take your son off the property.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.162
- What do you think I'm doing?
- Those are my toys.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.122
(Lynn) It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK, sweetie.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.833
- Let go of me.
- (Neighbour) Come here. Come here.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.252
Just tell them.
I just wanna go to my room. Please.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.630
You can't go to your room right now.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.299
You said we weren't gonna
lose our house. You lied to me.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.510
(Lynn) Sweetie, he didn't lie.
He didn't know.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.228
Do you think you're gonna
come to school tomorrow?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.026
- I don't know.
- Connor.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.779
Got to go.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.075
Well, what about our NBA 2K series?

18:40.619 --> 18:41.786
See you later.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.754
Not a problem.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.882
- Thank you for everything.
- Absolutely. Take care.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.259
See you soon.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.476
Mr Nash?

19:06.937 --> 19:11.482
You have 24 hours before my crew
returns to dispose of whatever remains.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.317
Not my choice.
Code enforcement.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.988
Good luck.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.059
You OK?

19:54.109 --> 19:57.320
(♪ Music blaring)

19:59.573 --> 20:02.241
(Shouting and laughter)

20:13.754 --> 20:14.879
Hey.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.510
(Lynn) Hey, do y'all know
where 229 is?

20:21.637 --> 20:24.430
(Woman) 229's up there.
(Lynn) Up here?

20:24.556 --> 20:26.515
Is there a stair near there?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.101
- Around the pool.
- Around the pool.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.355
- OK. Thank you.
- You got a lot of stuff.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.774
- Yeah.
- We can watch your stuff

20:34.900 --> 20:37.401
- while you take some of it up there.
- OK. Thanks.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.612
- You want a hand?
- (Dennis) That'd be great.

20:39.738 --> 20:43.157
- Are you planning on staying a while?
- No, just a couple of nights.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.452
Two years ago that's what we said.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.663
But, er, welcome anyway.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.251
(Shouting and swearing)

20:53.377 --> 20:55.211
Come this way.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.629
Come this way.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.838
Come on.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.830
- Where am I gonna sleep?
- (Lynn) Where do you wanna sleep?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.666
How about in this one
cos it's closer to the TV?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.585
That's a good call.
How about this, buddy?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.754
Take that off, put this one on.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.215
(Connor) Wait, this has to come off.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.017
- Am I going to school tomorrow?
- (Lynn sighs)

21:51.143 --> 21:53.394
We got to figure all that out,
don't we?

21:53.520 --> 21:56.439
(Connor) Yeah, cos, er...

21:56.565 --> 22:00.067
I have to see Derek.
And I promised him, so...

22:05.198 --> 22:07.199
Er, my name is Dennis Nash.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.368
I'm calling about the roofing job.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.831
Yeah, I work for Crown Construction.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.333
About five years.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.502
Um, you got anything else
on the books right now?

22:18.628 --> 22:20.254
All right, well, my number...

22:24.885 --> 22:26.761
Yeah, I got a ton of experience.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.388
I do electric, construction,
plumbing, anything.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.186
All right. Lower-level stuff?
Anything? Anything going?

22:35.645 --> 22:38.439
Do you know of anybody
that's hiring right now?

22:38.565 --> 22:41.150
All right. Thank you for your help.
Thank you for your time.

23:08.053 --> 23:12.598
(Whispering) Dennis, this motel
is half full of people like us.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.601
They're not people like us.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.396
They're all evicted
and they get stuck here.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.317
I could maybe take the bus
and start looking for apartments.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.070
- We can't afford it.
- It's just first and last month's.

23:26.196 --> 23:29.615
Plus two or three months' security.
Four maybe, cos of our credit.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.784
Our credit's shot.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.371
Dennis, we've...
We've got to get out of here.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.957
We've got to go to Tampa.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.584
- We gotta go to Uncle Jimmy's.
- We're not going to Tampa.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.753
Uncle Jimmy said we could come.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.839
I talked to Mary Margaret
just three days ago.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.424
We're not going to Tampa.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.846
You really wanna go to Tampa?

23:51.972 --> 23:55.766
You wanna take Connor out of school,
take him away from his friends?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.269
We leave, we give up.
We leave, we let the house go.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.731
I'm gonna figure it out.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.653
No choice.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.950
- (Lynn) Baby, you want some toast?
- No.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.743
You don't want any toast?

24:14.870 --> 24:16.829
I didn't leave any tools
in my truck, right?

24:18.415 --> 24:20.207
Huh? We got everything, right?

24:23.712 --> 24:24.962
(Lynn) What's wrong?

24:29.801 --> 24:32.678
Man, I mean, that's beautiful, but...

24:32.804 --> 24:34.638
- I was catching 2lb bass...
- Excuse me.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.432
- ...when I was six years old.
- Hold up.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.641
Hey.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.060
You stole some tools from me
during my eviction.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.980
I'm the senior sales manager.
What's the problem?

24:43.106 --> 24:46.692
- He stole 500 bucks' worth of my tools.
- You're just making up bullshit.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.444
I didn't steal your fucking tools.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.071
- We have a form you can fill out.
- Just give me my tools.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.324
If you have an issue
we got a form you can fill out.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.535
Just go back to your house
and look for your tools again.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.746
Oh, wait. You don't have
a fucking house, right?

24:58.872 --> 25:00.206
What the fuck?

25:01.708 --> 25:03.918
- Goddamn it!
- Give me my fucking tools back.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.086
- Fucker!
- Kick your arse.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.047
(Bill) Chill the fuck out!

25:08.173 --> 25:09.840
Hey, buddy, chill the fuck out!

25:10.467 --> 25:12.384
- Hey!
- Fucking call me a fucking thief!

25:12.511 --> 25:15.387
- Give me my fucking tools back.
- Knock that shit off right now.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.389
- Chill the fuck out!
- Get the fuck off of me.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.183
Bill, you wanna throw a couple of licks

25:19.309 --> 25:21.727
or are you just officiating
this event today?

25:21.853 --> 25:25.147
Sir, I was just...
I was trying to intervene, sir.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.566
What the fuck
are you still doing here anyway?

25:27.692 --> 25:31.111
- I thought, sir... I thought you said...
- You thought? Lord Almighty.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.406
You have evolved.
Has Darwin come to Orlando, Florida?

25:35.283 --> 25:38.577
- Well, Bill?
- We'll be there on time, Mr Carver.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.579
- Get to it.
- Yes, all right.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.915
All right, come on, vamanos.
Freddy, let's go.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.042
Guys, we're going to Vista Lakes.
Here we go.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.379
And you, sir, are you finished?
Cos I got the cops on speed dial.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.256
They could chase you out of town.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.840
I didn't come here to fight.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.759
I came to get my tools
that your guy stole.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.220
Do I look like Ace Hardware?
I don't deal in tools.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.347
- I deal in homes.
- Your guy stole the tools.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.975
- I understand what you do, sir.
- You do?

26:01.101 --> 26:03.018
You evicted me yesterday.
You kicked me out.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.563
I didn't kick you out, the bank did.
I just represent it.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.064
Richard Carver.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.902
What? You gotta be kidding me.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.738
When?

26:14.864 --> 26:16.574
Uh-huh.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.867
Yeah. Fuck Hazmat.
I'll call them myself.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.829
- 914 Shader Drive, now.
- (Jeff) What about Via Alizar?

26:21.955 --> 26:23.414
- Move it!
- Yes, sir.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.623
Let's go.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.001
Mr Carver, I'm sorry
to interrupt your day.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.377
- Are you Miguel?
- What?

26:28.503 --> 26:30.754
Do you work? You got tools?
You do construction?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.716
- Yeah, I do work.
- 914 Shader Drive.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.884
I'll pay you $50 cash.

26:36.553 --> 26:40.014
- What? Are you kidding me?
- $50 shouldn't be a joke to you, son.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.186
Are you gonna look into my...
Motherfucker!

26:46.313 --> 26:47.855
Fucking shit!

26:50.191 --> 26:51.900
Fucking cocksucker!

27:02.245 --> 27:03.912
I need your team out here in 30 minutes

27:04.039 --> 27:06.457
or it's gonna be a total gut job
to the goddamn studs.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.253
Yeah, these animals backed up
the sewage and skipped town.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.633
I'm glad you think that's funny.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.719
I got the neighbours threatening
to call the department of health.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.387
If your team isn't here in 30 minutes

27:20.513 --> 27:23.891
my next call's gonna be to Fannie
about your slow-arse response time.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.477
What do you mean,
shit's not a hazardous material?

27:26.603 --> 27:29.438
Why don't you come and eat some?
Maybe that will change your mind.

27:29.564 --> 27:31.023
Yeah, fuck you too.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.568
Rick, no.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.821
- Mr Carver, we don't...
- You know what's gonna happen, right?

27:37.947 --> 27:40.115
By tonight the mould's
gonna be up to the ceiling.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.702
By tomorrow someone's paying money
to demolish it.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.622
- And it ain't gonna be me.
- 300 bucks.

27:50.126 --> 27:51.210
200.

27:53.254 --> 27:55.297
That's a bear and you know it. 250.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.259
All right.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.972
Is this yours?

28:15.443 --> 28:16.694
(Retching)

28:16.820 --> 28:18.278
(Flies buzzing)

28:23.702 --> 28:25.452
Oh, fuck.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.268
(Jeff laughs)

28:50.186 --> 28:51.729
(Jeff) Harden the fuck up, son.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.274
There better be container trucks,
shop vacs and a blower here in one hour

28:55.400 --> 28:58.444
or I will make it my business that
you never work in Orange County again.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.156
You will also finish Via Alizar today.
You are on my list, shit-fuck.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.787
Nash.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.506
What else do you do?
Framing, electric, roofing, plumbing?

29:23.845 --> 29:25.012
All that, more.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.308
Go on, finish it.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.691
Ahh!

29:37.817 --> 29:40.611
All right, a six-pack
for the first guy in here with a shovel.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.281
Anybody?

29:44.949 --> 29:46.867
How much you pay for it?

29:46.993 --> 29:48.452
- $200?
- (Rick) 150.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.953
Plus the six-pack.

29:50.079 --> 29:53.707
- (Dennis) Cerveza por trabajo, si?
- Cerveza? Good.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.459
(Dennis) All right, let's go.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.170
Anybody else? How about you?

29:58.296 --> 30:00.255
It's just shit.
I know you need the money.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.467
There you go, there you go.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.428
Come on, red shirt.
What about you, pretty?

30:09.265 --> 30:11.350
All right, let's do it.
Let's get this shit done.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.565
- Dennis? Are you kidding me?
- Is that real money?

30:18.691 --> 30:21.276
- How much is this? 50.
- That's real money. Count it out.

30:21.402 --> 30:25.155
- 100. Another 50 is 150.
- Keep going.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.449
- $200?
- 250.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.576
Hold on a second.
Who called you? What's that?

30:29.702 --> 30:31.453
Some guys.
It was through, er...

30:33.623 --> 30:35.123
Not that guy Dan?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.668
- Is this a new job?
- It's a new guy. You don't know him.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.963
Javier called me
and we figured it out.

30:41.089 --> 30:45.259
This is serious money
and your son has just totally pocketed it.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.803
(Lynn laughs)

30:47.929 --> 30:50.806
- Where have you put it?
- (Lynn) That's the biggest money ever!

30:50.932 --> 30:54.226
- It's right here, Dad.
- That's my money!

30:54.352 --> 30:56.186
(Laughing) Don't you believe it!

30:58.565 --> 31:01.233
You're gonna make
new friends right now.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.777
You're gonna jump on here.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.821
I don't want to.

31:05.947 --> 31:06.989
I know.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.993
But I need you to be brave.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.246
But it's a different school.
I don't want to go to that school.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.292
I know you don't, but you got
to keep your grades up, remember?

31:19.961 --> 31:22.671
- You got to take care of yourself, OK?
- Yeah, I know. Bye.

31:22.797 --> 31:23.839
Hey, hey!

31:25.967 --> 31:27.342
I love you.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.679
Be safe, OK?
Take care of yourself, all right?

32:03.671 --> 32:05.839
- 'I see you.'
- Hey, Rick.

32:05.965 --> 32:08.634
'Come round back
to the screen door where the pool is.'

32:25.276 --> 32:27.361
(Girl) Who's that guy?

32:31.074 --> 32:33.033
All right, thanks. Bye.

32:33.159 --> 32:36.161
Nash. If it's not one thing
it's another.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.329
Come on.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.915
Oh, girls, it's hot in here.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.793
Calling all princesses.
It's time for the royal ice cream.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.044
(Girls) Yeah!

32:46.422 --> 32:48.840
(Dennis) It's a pretty place.
(Rick) Ah, it's OK.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.677
I got it 18 months ago.
I'm gonna flip it after New Year's.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.681
Let's have some Ben and Jerry's,
Cecilia, please.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.558
What is this?
Did you make these?

32:58.685 --> 33:00.102
What? Oh, it fell off.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.979
The AC's been out for two hours.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.690
Through there to the left
there's a leak. You'll see it.

33:07.860 --> 33:10.529
- Do they fly?
- No.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.649
(Phone rings)

33:49.110 --> 33:52.112
- This is Richard Carver.
- 'Adjustable rate mortgage, cocksucker!

33:52.238 --> 33:55.115
- 'I'm homeless, you motherfucker!'
- Stop calling me, you freak.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.325
'I'm gonna call you every goddamn day

33:57.452 --> 33:59.703
'to remind you
what a piece of shit you are.'

34:08.254 --> 34:10.255
They called here two days ago.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.299
I don't wanna change
our phone number again.

34:12.425 --> 34:16.303
Come on, boo. I got you and your mum
a week at the Corazon Spa in the Keys.

34:16.429 --> 34:17.888
I want you to enjoy yourself.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.056
- What?
- I should divorce you.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.143
We'd lose on taxes.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.103
And you'd miss me.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.355
You'd miss your little Richie,
wouldn't you?

34:56.677 --> 34:59.763
- What are you doing?
- I'm all done.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.849
Give the coils five minutes to dry,
but then you got cold air.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.769
- It's not even been an hour.
- I salvaged your ceiling with mud.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.687
I didn't want to tear up that dry wall.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.941
I found some paint in your garage
so I just patched that up too.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.568
Well, unless you're planning
on taking a swim, let's go.

35:21.577 --> 35:24.830
(Rick) What do you see out there?
(Dennis) I see homes.

35:24.956 --> 35:29.376
I just saw nine opportunities
to make money in the last five blocks.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.211
Three properties without mailboxes

35:31.337 --> 35:33.672
and one with an overgrown lawn
and no car in the drive,

35:33.798 --> 35:38.135
two with white signs in the windows
and three with shiny new doorknobs.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.304
If you can get attuned
to seeing those kinds of opportunities,

35:41.430 --> 35:44.808
you can get up off your hands and knees
and really start working for me.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.102
I can work.
You've seen me all week.

35:47.228 --> 35:51.189
Yeah, I know you worked for good crews
with Rick Kirby, Chris Camilleri, right?

35:51.315 --> 35:54.526
But the unfortunate thing is,
they're out of business.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.279
Cos they build homes.
I own homes.

35:58.489 --> 36:02.701
You know what I am? I'm a man
who owns a hell of a lot of properties.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.996
You can be a part of that,
but it's a hell of a responsibility.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.831
What I need to know
is that I have someone

36:07.957 --> 36:11.376
who can handle any situation
I want to walk away from, 24/7.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.837
I don't care
if your kid's in the school play,

36:13.963 --> 36:15.380
it's Christmas,

36:15.506 --> 36:18.592
you lined up
the best damn blowjob in Orlando,

36:18.718 --> 36:21.011
when you work for me, you're mine.

36:23.598 --> 36:24.723
What the hell?

36:30.646 --> 36:31.813
- (Beep)
- Call office.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.648
(Dialling tone)

36:35.693 --> 36:38.570
You see that?
The cable and the hose?

36:38.696 --> 36:41.072
- I see it.
- (Natalia) 'Rick Carver Realty.'

36:41.199 --> 36:44.075
I got some jack wagon
at 3505 Ridgeway

36:44.202 --> 36:46.786
stealing water and power
from 3509 Ridgeway.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.873
Call up the county court website,
find out if he's in default.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.626
- 'Yes, sir.'
- Quickly, please. I'm at his house now.

36:52.752 --> 36:53.835
'You got it.'

36:57.757 --> 36:59.424
You know how to shoot, right?

37:05.014 --> 37:08.516
I'll run a background check
so you can carry a concealed weapon.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.061
Go on.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.271
Are you fucking with me?

37:13.397 --> 37:15.232
Surly homeowners.
You're gonna need it.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.573
I'm not... No, I'm good.

37:23.699 --> 37:24.783
Suit yourself.

37:25.618 --> 37:30.038
The person on the other side of the door
doesn't always feel that way, trust me.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.667
See? They can feed their Rottweiler,
but they can't pay for their house.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.418
- (Phone pings)
- Mm-hm.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.463
Frank Greene. All right, let's go.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.769
Mr Frank Greene?

37:53.646 --> 37:55.438
- Yeah.
- I'm Rick Carver.

37:55.564 --> 37:59.609
- You're stealing from me.
- You mean the extension cord.

37:59.735 --> 38:03.363
Yeah, that property next door belongs
to Fannie Mae. I represent it for them.

38:03.489 --> 38:07.826
So you're not just stealing from me,
you're stealing from the US government.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.997
I'm with Frank Greene now.
What have you got for me?

38:12.123 --> 38:14.207
Remove the lines.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.885
I saw you at the foreclosure court.

38:26.012 --> 38:30.015
Our boys go to the same school.
They were playing with the globe.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.560
- Oh, yeah.
- I had my show-cause hearing.

38:34.603 --> 38:37.230
- What happened with you?
- I lost.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.026
Got evicted,
living in a motel right now.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.654
What are you doing with him?

38:45.865 --> 38:47.574
I got to work, you know.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.242
He offered me a job.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.829
I usually do construction, but...

38:52.955 --> 38:54.998
it's been dry for the last however long.

38:57.376 --> 39:00.045
- You know, this ain't what I do.
- This isn't me either.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.549
I was a manager,
Custom Cabinets and Lighting.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.345
Lost my job two years ago. Two.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.847
I'm not a thief.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.891
I know.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.894
I've been researching
on the internet, public libraries.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.645
I'm gonna save my house.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.023
I hope you do.

39:22.735 --> 39:25.362
Custom Cabinets?
Yeah, I installed your stuff.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.489
- Oh, yeah. A bunch of times.
- Hey, Dad.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.950
- Yes?
- The TV turned off.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.494
OK.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.746
You know my boy?
Connor? Connor Nash?

39:34.872 --> 39:36.081
Yes, sir.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.248
Yeah, thanks.

39:39.168 --> 39:43.380
Looks like the Bank of Greater Santa Fe
filed for final judgment of foreclosure.

39:43.506 --> 39:47.675
My money says the judge has me back
for your eviction in less than 90 days.

39:47.802 --> 39:51.596
I took down the extension cords
and the hose.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.640
I shouldn't have done that.
I apologise.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.892
- It's OK.
- No, I assure you, stealing is not OK.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.812
Mr Nash will be talking
to your neighbours personally.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.397
If we receive any reports

40:00.523 --> 40:03.316
or if we drive by and see you
stealing my water and power again,

40:03.442 --> 40:05.735
the next visit's
from the Sheriff's Department.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.487
Understand me?

40:07.613 --> 40:09.364
- Yes, sir.
- Good day.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.615
Nash, come on.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.329
Don't be soft.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.457
They all got a sob story.

40:19.583 --> 40:22.168
But the law's the law.
That's the side you're on.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.589
You should be smart enough
to know the outcome of this situation.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.091
So toughen up.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.057
(Rick) I'm evicting a hedge-fund manager
out of here in two weeks.

40:36.183 --> 40:37.851
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open

40:37.977 --> 40:39.978
and maybe you'll learn something
this time.

40:44.233 --> 40:47.152
I'll take the Moder sconces,
the chandelier,

40:47.278 --> 40:50.738
the Haleakala marble,
Harwood cabinets,

40:50.865 --> 40:52.866
range, Sub-Zero.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.445
- What about the microwave?
- I don't need a microwave.

40:56.495 --> 40:59.330
Three grand and you gotta
be out in two weeks.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.541
- How about five?
- Four.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.293
And Dennis here will get right to it.

41:04.503 --> 41:05.837
Done.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.342
The screws are right on in there.
Pop 'em right out, OK?

41:11.469 --> 41:12.552
Yup.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.309
(Beeping)

41:33.115 --> 41:35.992
Install everything, patch the tiles,
caulk the cabinets.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.453
Connect the gas line
when you bring in the appliances.

41:38.579 --> 41:41.247
- All this in here now?
- I'm selling this home for Fannie Mae.

41:41.373 --> 41:44.167
I can't do that
if it doesn't have a kitchen, can I?

41:44.293 --> 41:45.627
No.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.129
So, who just paid me $33,000

41:48.255 --> 41:52.258
for new cabinets, appliances
and a counter top plus labour?

41:54.011 --> 41:55.512
- Fannie Mae.
- Fannie Mae.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.306
Congratulations.
You just fucked the government.

42:02.144 --> 42:04.187
- Mr Nash?
- Yeah.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.695
If you're interested, let me know.

42:12.821 --> 42:15.156
If not, you can use this
to take your kid to Disney World

42:15.282 --> 42:18.368
and get yourself a job
Migueling Cinderella's castle.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.727
I don't give a shit about the government.

42:44.853 --> 42:47.272
They ain't never done
nothing for me, so...

42:47.398 --> 42:49.816
That's a lot of money
you just gave me.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.734
Feels a bit like trouble.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.279
You done honest work
your whole life building homes.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.532
What did that get you
but me knocking at your door?

42:57.658 --> 43:00.076
Are we stealing? Is this stealing?

43:00.202 --> 43:03.413
Well, in 2006 you borrowed $85,000
against your home

43:03.539 --> 43:05.290
and never paid it back, Nash.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.793
- You telling me that's not stealing?
- What? Are you serious?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.878
That's not stealing,
that's me taking a loan.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.298
That's me working my arse off
to pay back that loan.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.174
I wanted to pay it back.
I didn't steal.

43:15.301 --> 43:18.928
That's not how the banks see it
or the taxpayers paying for the bail-out.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.555
You think I bought a Porsche? No.

43:20.681 --> 43:24.309
I invested every cent I borrowed
into construction equipment

43:24.435 --> 43:28.104
so that I could pay back that loan
and put a roof over my family's head,

43:28.230 --> 43:29.939
put food in my kid's mouth.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.318
The economy crashed.
I can't predict the weather.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.528
I can.

43:35.654 --> 43:38.156
I'm a Doppler fucking radar.

43:38.282 --> 43:41.284
You took something you didn't give back.
The bank screwed you over.

43:41.410 --> 43:44.537
Take your pick.
Either way you lost.

43:44.663 --> 43:47.373
But I made more money
during the crash than before it.

43:47.499 --> 43:51.210
You can too, you just gotta stop
lying to yourself and ask,

43:51.337 --> 43:54.589
what did you do wrong
that your family lives in a motel?

44:04.266 --> 44:05.308
I'm gonna do it.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.728
Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do it, but...

44:10.481 --> 44:12.982
I need you to do me a favour,
help me get my family home back.

44:13.108 --> 44:15.693
I want you to take this
as my first payment.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.570
Don't get emotional about real estate.

44:17.696 --> 44:19.697
It's too late for that.
That's my family home.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.492
That's my boy's school,
so please just take this.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.994
This ain't gonna cut it.
Put that under your mattress.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.539
Don't put it in the bank.
You're just giving them more money.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.042
When you get enough
I'll tell you what to do with it.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.461
Now, do you want to double
what you just made or not?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.841
(Car horn honks)

44:38.967 --> 44:41.636
It's about fucking time, playboy.

44:44.431 --> 44:45.473
Damn.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.143
Always late, papa.
You always late, man.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.187
Yeah.

44:51.313 --> 44:53.231
That's the jackpot.

44:55.067 --> 44:57.694
- So who's this Rick Carver dude?
- That's my boss.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.612
For the time being.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.989
- What's that like?
- Oh, it's great. He's...

45:02.116 --> 45:03.991
Nah, he's a fucking arsehole.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.869
One, two, three.
Straight on.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.832
- What are you doing?
- Got to take a picture.

45:10.958 --> 45:14.043
To prove to the bank this shit's missing
so they pay us to put it back in.

45:14.169 --> 45:17.255
We're stealing it
to then bring it back?

45:17.381 --> 45:18.840
- You wanna get paid?
- Hell, yeah.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.007
I got to take a picture.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.305
- Yeah?
- Mr Tanner, my name is Dennis Nash.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.016
I'm here representing
Rick Carver Realty.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.269
Um, I'm here to, er...

45:31.395 --> 45:33.771
I understand your house
has been foreclosed on.

45:33.897 --> 45:37.400
The house still belongs to us
and we intend to keep it that way.

45:37.526 --> 45:39.819
I hope that works out.
God forbid it doesn't.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.530
If you got a second
I wanna tell you about cash for keys,

45:42.656 --> 45:44.615
here on the form.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.492
What do you mean,
cash for keys?

45:46.618 --> 45:49.245
(Dennis) If you leave your house
in a broom-swept condition

45:49.371 --> 45:50.621
prior to your eviction date,

45:50.748 --> 45:52.874
banks can give you 3500 bucks
cash in your pocket.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.836
We're not interested in anything.
Take your papers.

45:56.962 --> 46:01.007
We'll contact our attorney
and they'll get with you.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.063
What you doing, son?

46:16.190 --> 46:18.399
Who'll buy a home with a pool
if the pool don't work?

46:18.525 --> 46:20.902
- What do y'all think y'all doing?
- Doing some repairs.

46:21.028 --> 46:23.738
I know this house has been empty
for two or three months.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.574
You know Rick Carver Realty?
You see that sign on the lawn?

46:26.700 --> 46:28.451
- Yes, I did.
- That's who we work for.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.286
I hope you have a good day.

46:30.412 --> 46:32.371
- Is she your type?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

46:32.498 --> 46:34.373
It ain't a lot,
but it's gonna pay for U-Haul,

46:34.500 --> 46:36.626
storage, a down payment
on an apartment.

46:36.752 --> 46:39.170
I have no idea what's going on.

46:39.296 --> 46:43.925
Because my mum and dad
from Vietnam is coming

46:44.051 --> 46:45.760
and the house can't be foreclosured.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.846
Have you been putting notices
on my window?

46:48.972 --> 46:52.225
- No, that's the Sheriff's Department.
- Well, that's trespassing.

46:52.351 --> 46:55.353
I can't control what the department does,
but I can give you this form.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.647
I don't want your papers.
Don't hand me no papers.

46:57.773 --> 47:00.900
I don't want your papers or notices.
I want you to get the hell out of here.

47:08.742 --> 47:11.869
I've been owning this house
for seven years already.

47:11.995 --> 47:13.955
I met my wife right here.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.875
We're about to have a baby here.
I just made an addition in the back.

47:18.001 --> 47:20.795
I wanna save the house.
I wanna keep it.

47:20.921 --> 47:24.173
- Who are you?
- I work for a real estate company.

47:24.758 --> 47:28.928
This is a KYO form. Basically,
it means knowing your options.

47:29.054 --> 47:32.056
- My options?
- I'm putting it all on Facebook.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.767
- Kayla, put it away.
- We don't know who this man is.

47:34.893 --> 47:37.228
Kayla, go inside.

47:42.860 --> 47:43.985
I'm sorry, ma'am.

47:44.111 --> 47:46.279
I'm gonna have to take care of my kid.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.948
I advise you to call
that number at the bo...

47:49.074 --> 47:51.784
- If you wanna just take a look.
- I'm not looking at anything.

47:51.910 --> 47:53.828
You could just take it
and not look at it.

47:53.954 --> 47:55.621
Hold on a second.

47:57.249 --> 48:00.835
I think I've made myself clear to you.
I don't wanna see you again.

48:25.444 --> 48:28.613
Both Victor and Andy.
Neither one of them showed up.

48:28.739 --> 48:30.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:31.158 --> 48:33.200
I can't even give Connor his vitamins.

48:33.327 --> 48:35.828
I have one little kid Flintstone vitamin.

48:35.954 --> 48:37.121
(Day) They're good.

48:37.247 --> 48:39.999
- What do you got in there?
- What do you have in there?

48:41.919 --> 48:43.127
- A steak.
- What?

48:43.253 --> 48:45.796
That's Hamburger Helper
if I ever heard of anything.

48:45.923 --> 48:48.174
What does that look like to you?

48:48.300 --> 48:50.468
That looks like dinner for Day and I.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.178
Day, you come on and join us.

48:52.304 --> 48:54.889
You put that under your T-shirt.

48:55.015 --> 48:56.724
No, I'm not kidding.

48:56.850 --> 48:59.268
(Day and Lynn chatting)

49:01.396 --> 49:03.981
Oh, that was in.
Come on, Dad!

49:06.193 --> 49:07.860
Watch the lamp!

49:23.627 --> 49:28.130
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight ACs.

49:29.466 --> 49:30.883
And five pool pumps.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.970
- A good addition.
- I figured why not.

49:34.096 --> 49:37.390
Better count on seven.
I dropped that one. It's beyond repair.

49:37.516 --> 49:40.226
- Sell it for scrap metal.
- I already priced it out. 100 bucks.

49:40.352 --> 49:42.812
Good. Invoice Rick Carver Realty

49:42.938 --> 49:46.107
24K for the ACs
and 3200 for the pumps.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.859
The bank will reimburse me
to the same amount.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.904
Your cut is 25%, about 6700.

49:53.532 --> 49:56.033
- 6700?
- That's right.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.537
- Hey, Rick.
- What?

50:00.747 --> 50:02.206
You still got that Ruger?

50:04.001 --> 50:06.627
Excuse me? What did you say?

50:06.753 --> 50:09.463
Are you saying you want the gun?
Did I understand you?

50:17.014 --> 50:19.932
I ran the background check already.
You're clear to carry it.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.981
Who pays the most out
in cash for keys?

50:27.107 --> 50:29.233
Fannie and Freddie, then BoA.

50:29.359 --> 50:31.944
I want you to go to every one
of their foreclosed properties

50:32.070 --> 50:33.612
and find any that are unoccupied.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.906
(Rick) No homeowner, no tenant.
You got it?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.742
Yo, Terry, let's go.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.578
- Motherfucker didn't pay again.
- We got some money for you.

50:42.122 --> 50:45.041
Send 'em back, Luis.
Send 'em back, brother.

50:45.167 --> 50:48.002
- Dennis, where are we going?
- Be patient. Don't ask questions.

50:48.128 --> 50:50.755
- You don't trust me?
- You hired me, so I got no choice.

50:53.759 --> 50:55.176
Go, Terry.

51:02.476 --> 51:05.144
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Yo, T, let's go, baby.

51:05.270 --> 51:08.147
There's nobody here.
11286. There's nobody here.

51:08.273 --> 51:09.857
All right, bub. Jump in.

51:12.819 --> 51:14.570
(Dennis) How we doing, Javi?

51:18.241 --> 51:21.410
267 Lakewood.
Empty as a motherfucker.

51:21.536 --> 51:24.371
Right, turn to the back page.
I need y'all to sign these leases.

51:24.498 --> 51:29.251
The banks need to think you guys
are tenants in all these properties,

51:29.377 --> 51:32.088
so that I can negotiate
cash-for-keys deals with all y'all.

51:32.214 --> 51:35.508
- How much they paying?
- You can count on a $2500 cheque

51:35.634 --> 51:38.135
from the government
and the motherfucking banks.

51:38.261 --> 51:39.678
(Javier) 2500?

51:39.805 --> 51:43.057
They been fucking me for so long, man.
Shit, I'll take it back, brother.

51:43.183 --> 51:45.226
Somebody getting pregnant
tonight, baby.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.897
Who we fucking, man?
The government or the banks?

52:03.995 --> 52:08.165
Ah, Jim. See you for lunch
Wednesday, OK?

52:08.291 --> 52:09.834
You think Freeman
is the way to go?

52:09.960 --> 52:12.461
He's Fannie's number one attorney
three years running.

52:12.587 --> 52:14.713
He can connect us to bulk buyers.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.758
I'm not talking millions of dollars,
I'm talking billions.

52:20.011 --> 52:21.554
All right, so this is Dennis Nash.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.014
- County Commissioner Arthur Link.
- Pleasure.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.058
Your property at 2102 West Jefferson,

52:26.184 --> 52:28.561
I'll have Dennis make sure
the gutters are redone.

52:28.687 --> 52:30.396
- What happened to Bill?
- Killed him.

52:30.522 --> 52:32.731
This is my new guy.
I think he's gonna last.

52:32.858 --> 52:36.569
I'll get us a meeting with Freeman.
And stick with this guy, you'll go far.

52:36.695 --> 52:38.737
(Rick) Thanks for the recommendation.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.072
See you, Arthur.

52:43.910 --> 52:45.202
(Rick) What do you got for me?

52:45.328 --> 52:48.414
Successfully negotiated
six cash-for-keys with six tenants.

52:48.540 --> 52:53.335
Good. So, Nash, how much
did you tell your buddies per home?

52:53.461 --> 52:56.088
- 3500 or less?
- Yeah, 3500.

52:57.591 --> 52:59.383
Oh, you told them the full amount?

53:01.845 --> 53:03.429
I told 'em what I told 'em.

53:04.472 --> 53:05.890
What do you care?

53:10.228 --> 53:11.854
Yeah.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.656
Hey, baby. Look at that smile.
You're gorgeous.

53:25.118 --> 53:26.619
Don't you have class today?

53:26.745 --> 53:29.163
Er, they're all online,
plus I finished that website.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.956
Congratulations.

53:36.671 --> 53:37.713
She's my sweetheart.

53:37.839 --> 53:40.174
Studies graphic design.
I had her do my business card.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.429
- This your place?
- No, just keeping it warm.

53:45.555 --> 53:48.641
Why don't you scan those leases
and email them to Fannie and BoA.

53:53.939 --> 53:55.981
So, Nash, why aren't you married?

53:58.193 --> 53:59.902
I don't really got time for it.

54:00.028 --> 54:02.655
I don't trust a man who's not married.
Nobody does.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.782
Wanna tell me
what happened to Connor's mum?

54:07.244 --> 54:09.119
I don't think so, no.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.623
Prom night fiasco?

54:15.085 --> 54:17.378
Close, pretty close.

54:17.504 --> 54:21.257
The cheque for the AC
and pool pumps came in.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.300
It's a lot higher
than what I expected.

54:23.426 --> 54:24.468
7200.

54:25.595 --> 54:27.054
You wanna keep that?

54:27.180 --> 54:29.682
I'll give you the three grand
I already made.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.810
And whatever my share is
from these leases.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.607
Cos I want my home back.

54:40.026 --> 54:42.820
The BPO on your home
came in at 170K.

54:44.322 --> 54:46.031
I'll buy it

54:46.157 --> 54:48.242
and then you'll owe me 155

54:48.368 --> 54:52.913
at 12% amortised over a 30-year period
with a two-year balloon.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.960
That's a shitty rate, Rick.

54:58.086 --> 54:59.795
No bank's gonna loan you that money.

54:59.921 --> 55:01.338
If you don't pay, I'm on the hook.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.507
I don't want that property.
It has no future.

55:03.633 --> 55:06.010
- Yeah, but that's my family home.
- It's a home.

55:06.136 --> 55:08.637
But if you want it, it's yours.

55:08.763 --> 55:12.391
It'll take eight to 12 weeks
for the bank to list it on the MLS.

55:12.517 --> 55:14.852
You can do repairs,
but you can't move in till then.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.813
Can we figure out
some kind of contract?

55:17.939 --> 55:20.816
Yeah, I'll have the office
draw up a contract for deed.

55:24.571 --> 55:26.822
Is it mine again?

55:26.948 --> 55:28.657
Yeah, it's yours.

55:28.783 --> 55:29.950
OK, thank you.

55:31.244 --> 55:32.286
Seriously, thank you.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.496
- Rick, thank you.
- All right.

55:36.124 --> 55:37.166
No tears.

55:40.253 --> 55:41.295
Drink?

55:44.841 --> 55:46.175
No, I'm good, I'm good.

55:46.301 --> 55:47.760
High on life.

55:47.886 --> 55:49.928
Well, you might wanna reconsider.

55:50.055 --> 55:52.181
We got one more stop.

55:52.307 --> 55:54.350
224 Lake View Court.

55:55.810 --> 55:59.313
Is that Mr Tanner? I offered him
a cash-for-keys from the bank.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.899
Guess what? He never called.
And his eviction's today.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.692
You can pop your cherry
with this one.

56:04.652 --> 56:06.612
First one's a bitch,
but you get numb to it.

56:06.738 --> 56:08.947
All you gotta do
is stand next to me today,

56:09.074 --> 56:11.367
but after this
you're gonna do 'em on your own.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.078
Listen, Rick, I don't...

56:15.288 --> 56:18.082
- Could I... Could I just...
- Go fuck yourself? Yeah.

56:18.208 --> 56:21.460
What did you think it was gonna mean,
working for me?

56:21.586 --> 56:24.505
- I just thought that maybe...
- No, you didn't. You didn't think.

56:24.631 --> 56:27.049
You didn't have the guts
to ask me either. Nobody does.

56:27.175 --> 56:31.303
Because who in their right mind
wouldn't rather put someone in a home

56:31.429 --> 56:32.888
than drag 'em out of it?

56:33.765 --> 56:36.725
Up until three years ago
I was a regular old real-estate agent.

56:36.851 --> 56:40.270
Putting people in homes,
speculating on property, that was my job.

56:40.397 --> 56:44.650
Now, in 2006 Robert and Julia Tanner
borrowed $30,000

56:44.776 --> 56:47.027
to put an enclosed patio on their home

56:47.153 --> 56:50.614
that they had somehow managed
to live without for 25 years.

56:50.740 --> 56:53.909
Why don't you ask them about that
when they're spitting in your face

56:54.035 --> 56:55.494
while you walk 'em to the kerb?

56:55.620 --> 56:57.955
Why don't you ask the bank
what they were thinking

56:58.081 --> 57:00.082
giving them
an adjustable-rate mortgage?

57:00.208 --> 57:03.502
Then you can go to the government
and ask why they lifted every regulation

57:03.628 --> 57:05.754
and sat there like a retarded stepchild.

57:05.880 --> 57:09.216
You, Tanner, the banks, Washington,

57:09.342 --> 57:12.344
every other homeowner
and investor from here to China

57:12.470 --> 57:15.389
turned my life into evictions.

57:16.891 --> 57:19.268
I'm not an aristocrat.

57:19.394 --> 57:22.187
I wasn't born into this.
My daddy was a roofer, OK?

57:22.313 --> 57:24.940
I grew up on construction sites
watching him bust his arse

57:25.066 --> 57:27.317
until he fell off of a townhouse one day.

57:28.695 --> 57:31.780
A lifetime of insurance payments
and they dropped him

57:31.906 --> 57:33.949
before he could buy a wheelchair,

57:34.075 --> 57:36.869
but only after they got him
hooked on painkillers.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.538
Do you think
I'm gonna let that happen to me?

57:39.664 --> 57:43.167
Do you think America 2010
gives a flying rat's arse about Carver?

57:43.293 --> 57:44.668
Or Nash?

57:44.794 --> 57:48.755
Uh-uh. America
doesn't bail out the losers.

57:51.092 --> 57:53.927
America was built
by bailing out winners,

57:55.513 --> 57:58.056
by rigging a nation

57:58.183 --> 58:01.226
of the winners for the winners
by the winners.

58:04.355 --> 58:06.023
You go to church, Nash?

58:08.151 --> 58:09.902
- You go to church?
- Sure.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.990
Only one in 100
is gonna get on that ark, son.

58:18.119 --> 58:20.329
And every other poor soul's
gonna drown.

58:23.791 --> 58:25.542
I'm not gonna drown.

58:41.351 --> 58:42.601
I wanna do it alone.

58:44.729 --> 58:46.813
I've seen you do it.
I know how it's done.

58:48.233 --> 58:49.900
I'll do it alone.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.485
Help yourself.

59:17.929 --> 59:18.971
Wow.

59:19.097 --> 59:21.640
Rick told me there was a new guy.
Let's go, rookie.

59:21.766 --> 59:24.518
I didn't get all dressed up
just for you.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.041
You ready?

59:59.637 --> 01:00:01.013
Mr Tanner?

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.180
Yeah.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.017
- Mr Nash.
- Mr Tanner.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.768
Good morning.

01:00:06.894 --> 01:00:09.688
Dennis Nash from Rick Carver Realty.
Remember?

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:11.440
I remember you, Mr Nash.

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.193
- What do you want?
- I hate to say it,

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.323
but your eviction
is scheduled for today.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.827
And, um, your house
has been foreclosed on

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.038
and it's been transferred to the bank.

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.624
Now, I hate to be here doing this,

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.001
but I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the property.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:34.212
Now, look, my wife's on the phone
with her attorney right now.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.882
There's been a mix-up.
We're gonna get this sorted out.

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:39.676
If there's been a mix-up, sir,
I can't do anything about that.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.846
I'm just gonna have to ask you to leave.
I can't do anything about that.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:45.641
Look, honey,
have you got him on the phone?

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:47.100
(Mrs Tanner) Yeah.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:52.689
It doesn't matter whatever's happening
on the phone or not with your lawyer.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.859
- This is happening now.
- He said he'd call us back.

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.986
Well, there you go.
This is gonna have to wait.

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:01.239
Now, look we've got an appeal filed,

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:04.618
- so there's no point in you being here.
- I understand how you're feeling.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:07.204
It's a tough day and...

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:11.083
We're going to have to wait
till he calls back. We can't leave today.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.877
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- We're not ready for this.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.922
What I can do is give you some time
to go into the house,

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.548
grab all the stuff you need,

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.344
whether it's medicine,
stuff for your baby,

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.555
jewellery, any pictures,
anything valuable.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.600
No, no, no. You aren't supposed
to be here today, OK?

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:29.810
So you're leaving.

01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:33.647
I can only give you a few minutes
to grab some personal belongings.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:35.774
- I'm gonna ask you to leave.
- You are leaving.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.359
- We need to calm down.
- I am calm.

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:39.361
We're not going back.
Do not close the door.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:42.572
(Mr Tanner) You're all trespassing.
All of you, get off of my property.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.783
No, sir, you and your wife
are trespassing.

01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:46.618
This is the property of the bank now.

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:50.247
We're giving you an opportunity
to collect some of your belongings.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.124
I suggest you take advantage of it.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.460
There's two ways to do this:
the easy way where you pack up and go

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:58.380
or I escort you to jail.
It's your choice.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:01:59.923
Yes. Let's go.

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.551
- Gonna clear it.
- Gonna clear it.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.269
All right, we're clear.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:19.985
Now.

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.988
Be careful.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.907
You wanna handle that?
You know what to do.

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:35.041
Mr Tanner, I'm gonna have
to ask you to move to the kerb.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.419
- What?
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.463
Real sorry.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.632
- If I can help you with anything...
- No, I got it, I got it.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.093
- Let me grab this.
- No, no, no, no. I got it.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.974
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna do this today.
I tried to avoid this.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.393
How do you live with yourself?
You make me sick.

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:58.106
It's OK, baby. It's OK, baby.

01:02:58.232 --> 01:02:59.858
Oh, honey. No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:01.818
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.157
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think we're going?

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:54.412
- To see the Orlando Magic practise.
- Er, close, actually pretty close.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:57.165
We're gonna get myself
a tattoo of a snake

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.835
all over my arm,
wrapping around my arm.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:02.671
You want a tattoo of a snake?
I'll give you a tattoo of a snake.

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:04.297
- Ow!
- That will be the day.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:09.678
(Lynn) Are we gonna pull up?

01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:11.680
Get out.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.226
(Connor) What are we doing here?

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:18.854
- Take that.
- What are we doing?

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.065
- What are you doing, Dennis?
- What are we doing here?

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.650
I don't know.
What are we doing?

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:29.364
- You're making me nervous.
- How do you expect us to know?

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.949
Don't be nervous.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:37.706
There's an app for that.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.249
What was that?

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:44.421
Cops are coming back?

01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:50.218
- What are we doing?
- What are we doing here?

01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:52.095
Oh, my God, look.

01:04:53.514 --> 01:04:55.307
Oh, God.

01:04:56.642 --> 01:04:58.685
- What are we doing here?
- I got the home back.

01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:00.478
- What?
- So I have my room back?

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:03.607
- Yeah.
- How are we getting the house back?

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:04.900
I mean...

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.319
- My room looks so big.
- That's cos it is.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.696
We can't move in for a couple of weeks,
but it's ours.

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:11.698
- Dad, come see my room.
- I'm gonna explain.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:13.366
Come here.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.245
(Dennis) I know, it's huge.

01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:18.955
Oh, my God.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.638
Do you want bunk beds?
I'll make you bunk beds.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:38.058
A basketball hoop
so I can dunk it right there.

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:39.976
- What else? What do you think?
- A hot tub.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.436
A hot tub right there.

01:05:41.562 --> 01:05:43.897
And then paint it
black, blue and silver

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:46.024
like the Orlando Magic.

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.861
It's gonna be blue and blue and then
one small black strip all the way round.

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:52.822
I love it. You know
what else I was thinking?

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:56.034
- In the back yard we can get a pool.
- A pool? Yeah.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.287
- It better be a heated pool.
- Let's start painting.

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:01.706
There's a bucket right here.
I'm gonna join you.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.596
How are you doing this?

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:22.811
- How is this... How is this real?
- It's a contract.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.230
My boss bought it for me.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.901
- Why?
- And I'm paying him back.

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:32.028
In instalments, just like a bank.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.490
- OK?
- What does he get?

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:37.158
He gets...
He gets his money back.

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:40.161
He's giving me work
so he's gonna keep me in work.

01:06:42.039 --> 01:06:43.873
He's painting the room right now.

01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:48.503
I got it back.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.841
With your name.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.593
- Derek.
- Hey, Connor.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.928
What's up?

01:06:57.054 --> 01:06:58.388
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Mr Nash.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:06:59.973
What's up?
What do you wanna play?

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:01.141
(Squeals)

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:07.439
A dominant silverback gorilla.
We've been spotted.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.149
(Dennis growls)

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:11.651
(Connor shrieks)

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:31.880
Sheriff's department.
Anybody here?

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:35.425
All right, jump in.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.305
Thank you, Carl.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.558
- Mr Curtis, do you have any weapons?
- Mr Curtis doesn't live here.

01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:46.561
- (Sheriff) Er, Mr Nash?
- You're not Mr Ron Curtis?

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:49.314
No, that's my landlord.
He lives in Miami.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.067
- You're not the owner of this property?
- No, we rent.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:55.278
- We've been here for eight years.
- I posted notices on the door.

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.947
He said not to worry about it,
he's doing some type of...

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:01.826
- Like a modification or something.
- He scammed you, sir.

01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:04.704
Mr Brady, you've been scammed
by your landlord.

01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:08.666
- Now it's 3500, right?
- Yeah.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.251
3500.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.880
I can't... I can't get it.

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.478
- Mr Baldwin?
- Yeah?

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.063
Mr Nash.

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.733
Evening, Mr Baldwin.
My name is Dennis Nash.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.734
I'm here representing
Rick Carver Realty.

01:08:35.861 --> 01:08:39.154
Um, today is the day of your eviction,
I'm afraid to say.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:42.158
Um... the, er...

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:44.118
Your house has been...

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.497
- passed over to the bank.
- No, no, no. No, no.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:49.999
No, I...

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.627
I have a reverse mortgage
on this house.

01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:57.173
My wife and I took it out two years ago
and we're here forever.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:09:01.426
- You violated the terms of the mortgage.
- My wife went down to the bank.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:02.970
She signed the papers

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.640
and that was supposed
to be for her and for me.

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:08.852
Mr Baldwin, there's a process
that took place.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:12.188
All the paperwork was submitted,
signed by a judge. It's all legal.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.691
(Dennis) You wanna step outside?
You wanna sit with me?

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:19.279
OK, but I don't have the money
to buy the house back.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.532
(Woman) We did the modification.
They approved it.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.326
- We sent in our first cheque.
- I suggest we figure out a way

01:09:25.452 --> 01:09:27.328
to get all your stuff safe in a U-Haul.

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:30.665
I'm gonna have to call my husband.
I could maybe store it

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:34.085
down the street at my sister's house
for the day or something.

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:44.386
(Boy speaks Spanish)

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:47.015
(Dennis) The house
isn't yours anymore.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.058
(Boy translates)

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.060
(Removal man) Easy now.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.147
Anyone know what to do about a bird?

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.154
3500.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.207
I'm giving you the better option.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.834
I'm gonna have to send these guys
who are being employed today

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.753
to get your stuff
and throw it on the kerb.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.422
- I don't want to take you to jail.
- You do what you have to.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:22.175
- You know what you can do with that?
- You folks need to pack up.

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:24.886
You do something else with that
cos I'm not gonna touch it.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:27.764
You got any family or friends
who can come and pick you up?

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.183
I have a son.
He's up in Michigan.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.227
But I haven't seen him
in a couple of years.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:35.605
- Do you have his phone number?
- No, no.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.982
No, I don't. No.

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:39.817
- Nobody you can stay with?
- No, I don't.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:43.655
Are there any neighbours you can call
to help you out for the night?

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:45.490
I-I-I... I don't.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:48.034
I don't know my neighbours anymore.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.871
I can give you a ride to the Red Cross.
That sound all right?

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:58.169
I can do that.
We'll find you a place, all right?

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:27.490
Say short sale three times
and smile.

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:29.784
Short sale, short sale, short sale.

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.744
That's great. Perfect. Thank you.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.080
- Really nice. Last two.
- All right.

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:35.456
OK.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:37.667
(Rick) Pretty civilised.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:47.844
Tesken Equity Management picked up
400 homes in the past two months.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.679
All cash sales, no loans, $100 million.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:53.516
Orange County needs your help
in finding another bulk buyer like Tesken.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.978
I see. Then I'd like to know
where that highway is gonna be built

01:11:57.104 --> 01:12:00.523
connecting the 414
and the Apopka Expressway.

01:12:01.942 --> 01:12:04.569
Well, that information
is not public knowledge, so...

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:08.406
A lot of property's gonna be affected
by the zoning board's decision, Arthur.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.247
Anything else, Arthur?

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.043
OK, yes, I know the route.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.671
Good. There's a bulk buyer here
out of New York.

01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:25.465
Vesic Investment Group.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.968
They're shopping with a piss-ant broker
out of Kissimmee, Ortiz.

01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:32.555
- Sold him 15 homes last month.
- Mr Freeman, I know Ortiz.

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.974
I can get Vesic Investment Group
away from him

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.894
and my team can handle
as many homes as you have to sell.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.271
Well, I have
upwards of 1,000 homes.

01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:41.647
Possibly more.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.151
You get me Vesic Investment,
we're in business.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.404
1,000 homes.

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.740
Do you know how much money
we're talking about?

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:53.159
I want you to track Ortiz,
find out who he's talking to,

01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:54.744
what properties he's looking at.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.789
- We got to know what this Vesic deal is.
- What's my cut?

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:01.209
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
- I know standard commission is 6%.

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:04.045
So what's my cut?

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.548
I'll give you 5% of my take.

01:13:07.674 --> 01:13:10.468
- 10%.
- 6%, and a hand job.

01:13:10.594 --> 01:13:12.637
No callouses.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:16.224
You'll probably pull in
somewhere between 200 and 300K.

01:13:18.268 --> 01:13:21.938
- More than you made in your whole life.
- Yeah, that's more than I ever made.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:45.837
(lndistinct dialogue)

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:52.260
(Phone rings)

01:13:53.053 --> 01:13:55.471
- (Rick) 'What do you got?'
- 3217 Lonson Cove.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:59.183
It's the fifth one.
They're all Bank of Greater Santa Fe.

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:02.520
'Keep following that cocksucker
and get back to me.'

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:03.980
OK.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.213
Hey, Frank.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:33.968
What do you want?
Are you with those guys?

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:36.053
No, no, not at all.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.681
Er, I've just come to see
how you're doing.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:44.687
And, um, if you want,
I think I can get you a job.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.398
That's a nice shirt.
You still working with your friend?

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:53.404
I didn't have to come over here.
I just wanted to, um...

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:57.074
- To what? To lie to me, to cheat me?
- No, to help you if you wanted it.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.244
Have you figured out
where your kids are gonna stay?

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.330
My kids have a home.
This is their home.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.207
- Well...
- I did research,

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.709
gave boxes of files
to a lawyer pro bono.

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.628
We're gonna win, legally, in court.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.380
It's not gonna make any difference.
I've been there, Frank.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.590
I've been there.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:18.179
- You gotta be realistic.
- I'm being realistic.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:21.432
I didn't ask for your help, sir,
and I don't want it. Please leave.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:25.436
Please get off my property.
You're trespassing.

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.076
Hey, are you awake?

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:44.121
Ortiz, the king of Miguels,
is gonna sell 100 homes to Vesic.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:47.959
They're all in these neighbourhoods,
priced between 165 and 200K.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.920
We're talking over a $20 million deal

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.838
and it's not mine.

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:57.218
- Holy shit.
- Yup.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.309
Triple word score.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.815
- Take that.
- We're working, baby.

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.442
Dennis, tell him to take a break.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.819
Take a break, Rick.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:16.320
(Rick kisses her)

01:16:16.446 --> 01:16:17.780
You inspire me, OK?

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.448
We'll play later.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.286
Er...

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:31.460
OK, so you know Vesic already bought
15 homes from Ortiz last month.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.087
So?

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:36.591
So, what if I take all the ACs,

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.259
all the water pumps

01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:41.304
and the appliances
out of those homes?

01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:45.016
Who do you think
Vesic's gonna blame?

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.225
Ortiz.

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:49.562
They'll call Immigration, put him
on his lawn mower back over the border

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.981
while I'm on the phone
with Bank of Greater Santa Fe.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.069
Yeah.

01:16:58.363 --> 01:17:00.531
And we'll sell these 100 homes.

01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:03.034
And 1,000 more for Freeman.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.077
I see green skies ahead.

01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:09.790
Put some green in my pocket,
I'll empty those homes tonight.

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:11.375
100 bucks a pop, 1500 bucks.

01:17:11.501 --> 01:17:13.336
Big talk. All right, do it.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.796
- Tell him to hurry up.
- We got that cube truck too.

01:17:15.922 --> 01:17:17.673
- HVAC pool pump.
- HVAC pool pump.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.009
But come this way too.
I wanna show you something.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.768
- Are you going in?
- No, you're going in.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:32.438
Nah, that's B&E, man.
That's guaranteed time right there.

01:17:32.564 --> 01:17:35.316
It's not B&E if you got a key.
We're doing appliances too.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:38.402
We're doing fridges,
stoves, dishwashers.

01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:40.404
- You gonna take care of me?
- You know I will.

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.490
Whatever I can afford.
You know that.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:46.619
I'm heading to handle this cash-for-keys
Rick wanted me to do.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:49.538
Yeah. Hold on.

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.585
1485 Lake Shore Circle.

01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.462
Is that property for sale?

01:17:57.214 --> 01:18:00.174
Does it have a swimming pool?
All right. I'll call you back.

01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:18.526
(Connor) Three, two, one.

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:19.944
(Cheering)

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:26.325
(Lynn) Derek, over here.

01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:29.453
- Every put your hands out.
- Yes!

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:33.040
(Cheering)

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:34.750
Happy birthday!

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:38.754
All right, Mountain Dew.
What's happening?

01:18:39.923 --> 01:18:41.841
- Who wants it?
- (Dennis) Connor.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.676
(Kids cheer)

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:45.261
God, Dad!

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:49.849
- What do you think?
- Awesome!

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:53.686
Jump on it. Jump on it.
Sit down on it. Sit down on it.

01:18:55.355 --> 01:18:56.939
Show us what you got.

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:00.025
Nice.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:05.114
(Dennis) Careful.
(Lynn) Car, guys.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:10.995
Hey.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:16.667
Hey, Connor. Let's see
if these guys want some of your cake.

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:18.961
Do we have a cheese pizza left?

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:21.464
Do you guys wanna ask them
if they want some cheese pizza

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.841
and some birthday cake?

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:26.177
- All right, I gotta get Derek home.
- OK.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:28.637
I'm gonna grab that cheese pizza
and some cake.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.182
I think it's nice for them
to say hi to these guys.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:33.142
- I gotta get Derek home.
- (Man) Hey!

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.519
Hey, where are you going?

01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:37.438
Hey, you!

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.024
Over here.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.903
- I'm talking to you.
- You're talking to me?

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:46.197
What are you doing here?
Are you following me?

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.949
No, I live here.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:52.203
- Yeah, I know who you are.
- Have a good day.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:55.206
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean? I live here.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:56.832
I just told you.
I don't know you.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.585
No, you're Rick Carver Realty.
I know exactly who you are.

01:19:59.711 --> 01:20:01.629
- You don't know me.
- Oh, I know you.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.548
- You kicked me out of my home.
- What?

01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:07.009
I don't know you, bud.
Come over here and we'll talk.

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:11.222
Why would I walk over here?
Nash. That's your name, isn't it?

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.641
You don't want
everybody else to hear about it,

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.601
what a fucking arsehole you are

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:18.687
and how you kicked me
and my entire family out of our home?

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.232
- You got me mixed up with someone.
- No, I don't.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.942
I know exactly who you are.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.693
Oh, you know it was you.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.737
And here everybody else
is gonna know.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:29.073
- Just calm down.
- You kicked me out of my home.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:32.576
You ruined my fucking life.
No, you don't get to go anywhere.

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:34.453
- Dennis!
- (Dennis) Don't do that.

01:20:34.579 --> 01:20:36.664
- Don't you tell me what to do.
- Get inside.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.916
- Get inside.
- Yeah, get inside.

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:42.211
- Don't fucking talk to her like that.
- What are you gonna fucking do?

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:44.380
Please, guys. Please!

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.051
Go inside, go inside!

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:51.428
- Take him inside!
- OK.

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:54.181
- Go, go, go.
- (Man) You little fucking piece of shit.

01:20:54.307 --> 01:20:57.059
- You ruined my life.
- I'm not fucking with this guy.

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.644
Yeah, you better not fuck with me.

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.604
- I don't know you, man.
- You know me.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.398
- I don't know you.
- Bullshit!

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:06.652
- I don't fucking know you.
- I know you, Rick Carver Realty.

01:21:06.778 --> 01:21:09.738
I know you
and I'll see you every day,

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:13.284
when you wake up, when you go to bed,
when your fucking kids are playing.

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:28.841
You OK?

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:32.803
How did he know your name?

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.265
I don't know.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.728
- Cos he knew your face too, right?
- Yeah.

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:42.563
Yeah, I know.

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:45.399
Maybe I worked on his house.
I work on foreclosed homes.

01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:47.735
Maybe he saw me at his home.
I don't know.

01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:49.028
Rick Carver.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:51.447
Right?

01:21:56.786 --> 01:21:59.204
- (Connor) How did he know your name?
- (Banging on door)

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.456
(Man) Fucking arsehole!

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.710
- We gotta get Connor out of here.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

01:22:04.836 --> 01:22:07.087
- Now.
- That's what I'm trying to do, Mum.

01:22:07.213 --> 01:22:08.255
Right now.

01:22:08.381 --> 01:22:10.341
- (Man) Get the fuck outta here.
- Fuck you!

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.468
- You motherfucker.
- Fuck you!

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:15.429
OK, we need to go.
We need to get out of here, OK?

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:18.140
(Man) Have some fucking balls.

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.854
- Are you evicting people?
- Mum!

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:27.316
- He said you were at his eviction.
- I don't know that fucking guy.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:29.568
I don't know how he knows me.
I work on homes.

01:22:29.694 --> 01:22:32.029
I work on foreclosed homes, Mum.

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:36.867
This guy was being foreclosed on.
Maybe he saw me working on his home.

01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.953
Maybe. I don't know.

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:40.829
- OK?
- Just tell me.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.623
I'm telling you.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.796
Bolt the door. Don't leave.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.471
(Helicopter rotor blades whirring)

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:05.813
(Rick) Disney World, Sea World,
Universal Studios.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:08.691
Downtown Orlando's
about 20 miles behind us.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.777
And then at your nine o'clock
are the vacant Greater Santa Fe homes.

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:14.822
Wow, I never realised
how close they were to Shinola.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:16.031
Mm-hm.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:19.702
- About the Santa Fe deal.
- It hasn't even been a week

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.413
since we picked up 15 homes from Ortiz

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:27.167
and all the ACs, water pumps,
appliances are missing.

01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:30.587
- You're kidding me.
- Hidden expenses, they kill returns

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.756
so Vesic's not interested anymore.

01:23:32.882 --> 01:23:35.968
That Santa Fe deal's like
one giant ATM machine.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.429
What can I do to get Vesic
back into those homes?

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:40.848
I just don't think
that's gonna be possible.

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.016
How about this?

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:46.687
I'll put brand-new appliances
in all 15 of those homes free of charge

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:48.939
if you move the deal
from Ortiz over to me.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.066
I tell you what.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:54.111
You put brand-new ACs,
appliances, water pumps

01:23:54.237 --> 01:23:56.280
in any of the 100 homes that need 'em

01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:58.032
you got yourself a deal.

01:23:59.325 --> 01:24:01.368
Appliances, yeah.

01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:04.580
ACs and water pumps, no.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.044
OK.

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.422
But the homes have
to be vacated in 30 days.

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.551
Put it in writing, it's a deal.

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.570
Hey! Look at that!

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:39.073
Bring him in. Bring him in.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:48.165
(Rick) The Santa Fe deal,
I'll give you 6% of my share.

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:52.586
Around $63,000 before taxes.

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:00.302
OK. I mean, I guess
I can accept that. That's fine.

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:03.013
Yeah, I can deal with that amount.
$63,000 did you say?

01:25:03.139 --> 01:25:06.100
- What are you boys up to?
- Aren't you so sweet?

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:08.769
I used to dream about one home.
Now it's 100.

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.480
All right.

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:13.190
- Dreams.
- To dreams.

01:25:13.316 --> 01:25:15.400
Fuck dreams. To 100 homes.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:34.253
Hey!

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:50.686
Uh-oh. Zombies coming to get me.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.156
- Oh, fuck.
- Damn, pilgrim.

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:20.048
Did anyone ever come up to you
after an eviction?

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:26.680
Yeah, someone tried
to run me off the road last year.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:32.186
I haven't gone out to dinner once

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:34.354
with my wife and girls
in the last three years

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.981
without looking over my shoulder.

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:39.526
That's why I carry this.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.742
Even now at 5am.

01:26:57.879 --> 01:26:59.588
Is it worth it?

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.674
As opposed to what?

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.388
Did somebody get to you?

01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:19.233
Don't bullshit me.
Someone's calling you.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.776
Or they tried to find you.

01:27:25.698 --> 01:27:27.491
So, Nash,

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:30.702
the sun's gonna come up
and here we are.

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:31.912
What do you think?

01:27:33.998 --> 01:27:35.666
Huh.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:39.670
- Think about what?
- Well, you wanted to kill me once.

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:42.130
Now you're gonna make a lot of money.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.259
I did want to kill you.

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.554
I don't know.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.224
I don't know what I'm doing here either,
but I'm thankful.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:56.311
You know.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:01.733
I don't know. What could I do?
You know, my dad...

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.653
Well, he killed himself pretty much.

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:10.575
Fuck it, no. Sorry.
I don't wanna waste your booze.

01:28:13.871 --> 01:28:16.081
He... He died of a heart attack.

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:18.250
Booze, food.
Whatever you wanna call it.

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:21.378
Left me with my mum.

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:23.839
My boy.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.551
My boy, my boy.

01:28:32.598 --> 01:28:33.974
As opposed to what?

01:28:35.768 --> 01:28:38.061
I gotta get out of that motel now.

01:28:39.897 --> 01:28:42.482
I gotta get into my home.
I gotta get my family out.

01:28:42.608 --> 01:28:45.652
It's gotta be listed on the MLS,
for sale.

01:28:45.778 --> 01:28:47.404
- I need it.
- Two more weeks, OK?

01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:48.989
I need it now.

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:52.034
- Get another one.
- Help me with it.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.036
You got the money.
Buy whatever you want.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:55.829
There's plenty of homes in the sea.

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:59.041
Like I said,

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:02.502
don't get emotional
about real estate, Nash.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:05.255
They're boxes.

01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:07.132
You listening?

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:10.761
Big boxes, small boxes.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:13.597
What matters is how many you got.

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:17.893
You're gonna have more properties

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.103
than women to fill them with.

01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:21.897
You know that, right?

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:26.276
You love your mum, you love your kid.
Buy 'em a house.

01:29:26.402 --> 01:29:28.779
Buy one for your mum.
Buy one for your kid.

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:30.405
Buy one for yourself.

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:32.282
What do I care? Jesus.

01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:33.784
100 homes.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.120
1,000 fucking homes.

01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:43.335
Watch out for the gators.
They don't sleep.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:45.629
And make sure I don't roll in the water.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.946
(Lynn) Why are we going this way?

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.283
I just wanna show you something.

01:30:31.717 --> 01:30:33.844
(Lynn) Dennis, what are we doing?

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.096
(Dennis) Just trust me
and follow me, please.

01:30:45.898 --> 01:30:48.358
- What is this?
- Have a look.

01:30:48.484 --> 01:30:49.526
Why?

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:53.572
Will you just have a look?

01:30:57.994 --> 01:31:00.454
- (Connor) It's a cool pool.
- Cool pool.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.165
I'd say.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.417
Makes you wanna dive in, right?

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:09.045
- Whose basketball goal is that?
- That belongs to Shaquille O'Neil.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:11.840
He lowered it cos he likes to dunk
from sitting down.

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:16.011
- (Lynn) Can we go now, please?
- Have you seen the pool?

01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:19.806
I bought this for you.

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:25.729
And you. That's your pool.
This is your house.

01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:27.314
Let's go home. This isn't funny.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.983
- I'm not joking, Mum.
- That's not his basketball net.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.695
This is somebody else's
and I want our house.

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.780
I wanna go home.

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:38.492
We don't have that home anymore.
I sold it.

01:31:41.078 --> 01:31:43.163
I sold our old home
and I bought this.

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:46.374
Fresh start. I don't wanna go back
to that house we were evicted from.

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.460
You sold our house?

01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:50.962
We couldn't move into our old home
for two to three weeks

01:31:51.088 --> 01:31:54.716
so I had to get us out of that motel
so that Connor wouldn't get killed.

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:58.470
By kicking people out?
By kicking people out of their houses?

01:31:58.596 --> 01:32:01.223
- You buy this?
- I didn't kick anybody out of this home.

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:03.141
I bought this home
with money I earned

01:32:03.267 --> 01:32:06.645
so I could put a roof over your head
and I could put food in his mouth.

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.856
- We were drowning, Mum.
- This stops here.

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:14.236
I bought this fair and square.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.655
- I didn't take it from anybody.
- I'm gonna call Jimmy

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:20.617
and we're going to Tampa, OK?
Come on, Connor.

01:32:20.743 --> 01:32:22.202
I'm gonna call my brother.

01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:26.248
We're gonna go to Tampa
and you're gonna figure this out.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.124
I did this for the boy.
We were drowning.

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:31.670
Rick Carver? Rick Carver
who bought our house for us?

01:32:33.839 --> 01:32:36.299
I'm not staying here.
I'm not staying in this home.

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.096
What do you want?

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.561
(Knocks on door)

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.731
Is Connor OK?

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.190
He's sleeping.

01:33:37.486 --> 01:33:39.279
(Phone rings)

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:43.825
Hey, Rick.

01:33:45.828 --> 01:33:46.995
Yeah, sure.

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:49.164
OK.

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.727
- Give it to him.
- Yep, all right.

01:34:11.854 --> 01:34:14.022
- See you, fellas.
- 9:45.

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:15.190
Yes, sir.

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.485
- Goddamn it.
- What is it?

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:23.198
One Santa Fe homeowner is gonna try
and block his eviction in court today.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:26.242
If he's successful and others follow,
Vesic will pull out.

01:34:27.578 --> 01:34:29.412
This is proof of publication.

01:34:29.538 --> 01:34:31.623
It wasn't filed two years ago,

01:34:31.749 --> 01:34:33.792
so Freeman's boys
backdated and notarised it.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:36.920
Now, I need you to be
at the courthouse plaza at 9:45am.

01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:40.131
The court clerk will meet you there.
Just give it to him, OK?

01:34:40.966 --> 01:34:42.842
This is forged?

01:34:42.968 --> 01:34:45.136
It's a stupid piece of paper
someone forgot to file

01:34:45.262 --> 01:34:48.014
when the loan was being bought
and sold a million times over.

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.933
It's just a technicality.

01:34:54.146 --> 01:34:55.689
- It's Frank Greene.
- Yeah.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:59.442
Same deadbeat stealing my water
and power. I told you he was no good.

01:35:02.154 --> 01:35:05.115
Hey, that's not your dick
in your hand, son.

01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:07.033
That is the Santa Fe deal.

01:35:07.159 --> 01:35:10.870
100 homes, 1,000 more for Freeman.
Our money, Miami.

01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:13.123
Your home, everything.

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:15.500
- Got me?
- Mm-hm, yeah, I do.

01:35:15.626 --> 01:35:18.002
Don't "mm-hm, yeah, I do" me.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.004
Courthouse plaza, 9:45am.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:28.638
(Dialogue indistinct)

01:35:37.815 --> 01:35:38.857
Hey, honey.

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:54.956
- Hi.
- Say hello.

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.458
Hi, Mr Peters.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.671
(Phone buzzes)

01:36:10.973 --> 01:36:12.682
(Phone rings)

01:36:36.665 --> 01:36:39.375
- Hello.
- What the hell is going on?

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:41.169
'What do you mean?'

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:44.923
You get your arse over there now
or consider your life over, do you hear?

01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:47.175
- Where are you?
- 'I'm here now.'

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.760
And?

01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:52.430
- I'm about to do it now.
- 'You dumb fuck.'

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:54.974
You call me as soon as it's done.

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.601
You hear me?

01:37:17.039 --> 01:37:18.998
Hey.

01:37:19.124 --> 01:37:21.417
Hey. Hey.

01:37:22.127 --> 01:37:23.169
Hey!

01:37:25.214 --> 01:37:27.590
Are you with Rick Carver?

01:37:27.716 --> 01:37:29.843
Are you with Rick Carver?

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:32.887
Are you with Carver or not?

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:34.389
Is that it?

01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:38.810
Idiot!

01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:44.941
(Judge) As far as I can tell
the proof of publication is here.

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:47.151
(Lawyer #1) Your Honour,
we have a buyer in place

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:49.445
and we'd like to get
this property on the books.

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:53.491
(Lawyer #2) If we check the fall index
this has not been docketed.

01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:56.452
(Judge) Well, that may be,
but the proof is in the file.

01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:59.664
That's all the statute requires.
I'm ordering the sale to go forward.

01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:02.834
(Frank) Your Honour, we know for a fact
that the files weren't there.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.252
(Judge) ESP versus Ballard.

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:08.464
(Frank) Your Honour, I know
that there was no proof of publication.

01:38:08.591 --> 01:38:10.174
- You can't look at me...
- What is it?

01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:12.093
I have a wife and I have...

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:14.971
These guys. You see them?

01:38:15.097 --> 01:38:17.640
You see my wife and my children?

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:52.759
Connor?

01:38:57.014 --> 01:38:58.389
Mum? Connor?

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.642
Connor?

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:06.356
(Dialling tone)

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.697
'Please record your message
after the tone. When you have...'

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:54.654
(Phone rings)

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:09.711
'Hey, Rick.'

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:12.171
Morning, Donald Trump.
I'm outside your new mansion.

01:40:12.297 --> 01:40:15.425
Where are you?
Frank Greene's eviction. Let's go.

01:40:16.802 --> 01:40:18.886
'Hello? Dumb arse, are you there?'

01:40:23.267 --> 01:40:26.561
There's eight other homeowners
we got to evict after Greene.

01:40:27.938 --> 01:40:30.732
I'll start out nice
with an aggressive cash-for-keys.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:33.776
I'll pay out of my own pocket
if I have to. I don't give a shit.

01:40:33.902 --> 01:40:36.696
But if they give me any flak,

01:40:36.822 --> 01:40:39.157
Freeman's boys
and the court clerk, baby.

01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:41.534
No big deal.

01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:48.332
We've been neighbours for a long time

01:40:48.459 --> 01:40:51.753
and I've never seen
anything like this before.

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:53.921
Do you know if they have
any guns in the house?

01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:56.382
- I mean, he likes to hunt.
- He's a hunter?

01:40:56.508 --> 01:40:58.426
Yeah, he likes to hunt.

01:40:58.552 --> 01:41:02.722
She gripes a lot,
but he's a pretty even-keeled guy.

01:41:02.848 --> 01:41:05.433
- Not hot-tempered or anything?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:08.519
I can tell you, it's been really hard.
His wife's been a worried wreck.

01:41:08.645 --> 01:41:12.231
Morning, Rick. We may have
some trouble with Mr Greene, the tenant.

01:41:12.357 --> 01:41:14.525
He and his wife
have been looking into stuff.

01:41:14.651 --> 01:41:17.904
Well, I mean, you know.
Look, last night I heard 'em yelling.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.864
(Rick) Ma'am, thank you.

01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:23.242
We're not marriage counsellors, OK?
Let's get cooking.

01:41:23.368 --> 01:41:26.788
The problem is,
this guy may be armed.

01:41:28.624 --> 01:41:30.625
Go find out.
I got two more evictions today.

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:33.920
All right. I'll contact Orlando PD,
get a back-up come in and check it out.

01:41:34.046 --> 01:41:37.715
- Is his family in there with him?
- The kids didn't go to school.

01:41:37.841 --> 01:41:39.383
They're definitely home.

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:42.804
She came over this morning, crying,

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.098
until he called her back in.

01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:51.354
I'll go and check it out.

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.564
(Rick) Thanks for the play-by-play.
Hurry up.

01:41:57.653 --> 01:41:59.779
Watch out! Get back!

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:00.988
Run!

01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:05.118
(Frank) I do not wanna hurt anybody.

01:42:05.244 --> 01:42:06.994
Sir, put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:09.789
Put the gun down, sir.
Put the gun down, sir.

01:42:09.915 --> 01:42:12.875
You put that down.
My wife and kids are in this house.

01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:15.628
Get your gun. You don't have it?

01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:18.881
- Dumb shit.
- Sir, put the weapon down.

01:42:19.007 --> 01:42:20.800
Trespassing.

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:24.011
- Sir, don't do that.
- Shots fired, shots fired.

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:27.390
- (Frank) You wanna shoot my kids?
- Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:29.725
I am not gonna leave here.
Go in the bedroom.

01:42:29.852 --> 01:42:31.727
Don't stand there.
Get in the bedroom.

01:42:31.854 --> 01:42:33.271
Now.

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:35.189
- I shot at the grass.
- Put the gun down.

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:37.608
God damn it, stop it.
Put that down.

01:42:37.734 --> 01:42:40.278
- Put it down now.
- Not gonna happen, sir.

01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:43.281
Sir, why don't you send
your wife and kids out?

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:47.743
Send your wife and kids out.

01:42:51.456 --> 01:42:53.332
Sir, drop your weapon.

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:04.177
The court decided my case
in 60 seconds flat.

01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:07.597
Nobody checked the file index. Fact.

01:43:07.723 --> 01:43:11.726
No proof of publication filed. Fact.

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:15.605
Nobody looked at the cancelled cheques
to prove bank payment. Fact.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.026
The judge, he wasn't up for re-election.

01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:24.030
He wasn't beholden
to anybody in this county.

01:43:24.156 --> 01:43:27.366
60 seconds for a lifetime
and this is my home.

01:43:27.492 --> 01:43:29.076
- Dad.
- (Gun goes off)

01:43:29.203 --> 01:43:30.745
- (Screaming)
- Get in the bedroom.

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:33.664
- Get in the bedroom!
- No, Dennis.

01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:35.625
- Dennis.
- Get the fuck off.

01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:38.586
- No.
- (Sheriff) Sir, Mr Nash.

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:42.131
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Mr Nash, get back behind the car.

01:43:42.257 --> 01:43:43.633
Get back! Sir, get back!

01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:45.259
Stop! Stay right there.

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.345
I'm gonna shoot you.
I will shoot.

01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:49.555
- This is my home.
- Listen to me.

01:43:49.681 --> 01:43:51.390
- Get off of my lawn.
- This is your lawn.

01:43:51.516 --> 01:43:53.643
- This is your home, I know.
- What are you gonna do?

01:43:53.769 --> 01:43:56.896
Do you hear me?
The banks made more money...

01:43:57.022 --> 01:43:59.899
- Frank.
- I have got the right to shoot anybody

01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:02.276
who is on my property,
who sets foot on my property.

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:05.655
- I don't want to do this.
- Frank, I know this is your home.

01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:08.950
Put the gun down
and let your family out, please.

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:10.952
Look up there. Look up there!

01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:13.996
You see that?

01:44:14.831 --> 01:44:16.791
That is the sun

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.793
and it is shining.

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:21.879
Nobody is gonna tell me
it is night when it is day.

01:44:22.005 --> 01:44:25.341
And God Almighty could come down here
and tell me it's night

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.802
and I would know that it's day,

01:44:28.845 --> 01:44:31.931
because I know what I know.

01:44:32.057 --> 01:44:36.102
And nobody is gonna tell me
the sun isn't shining. Nobody.

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:38.980
I cheated you.

01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:46.654
I put a forged document in your file

01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:49.865
on the day of your court hearing, Frank.

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.416
This is your home.

01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:30.489
All right, I'm coming out.

01:45:32.367 --> 01:45:34.702
(Sheriff) All right, sir.
Keep your hands up.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:36.579
Walk this way slowly
with your hands up.

01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:41.167
- Hands up.
- Put your hands up. Hands in the air.

01:45:41.293 --> 01:45:43.419
Walk out slowly.
Keep your hands in the air.

01:45:43.545 --> 01:45:45.296
Keep walking. Keep walking.

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:49.258
Stop. Turn around, face the home.

01:45:49.384 --> 01:45:51.302
Turn around, turn around.

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:53.804
Now walk slowly
towards the sound of my voice.

01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:56.307
Stop. Go down on your knees, sir.

01:45:56.433 --> 01:45:59.685
Lie down on your stomach, sir,
with your arms extended to the side.

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:04.398
We're coming in, ma'am.

01:46:11.573 --> 01:46:13.199
Stand up.

01:46:13.325 --> 01:46:16.577
Got anything on you that could
poke me, stick in me, hurt me?

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:17.787
Call it in.

01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:19.121
No, sir. No.

01:46:20.248 --> 01:46:22.833
All right. You have the right
to remain silent.

01:46:22.959 --> 01:46:24.877
Anything you say
can be used against you.

01:46:25.003 --> 01:46:27.880
You have a right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

01:46:28.006 --> 01:46:30.633
If you can't afford one,
the court will appoint one for you.

01:46:30.759 --> 01:46:31.842
Sir.

01:46:31.968 --> 01:46:34.220
OK, I just wanted...
He didn't do anything.

01:46:34.346 --> 01:46:36.222
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- Calm down.

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:39.809
- What is your business here?
- I came here to evict Mr Greene.

01:46:39.935 --> 01:46:42.186
- Who are you working with?
- Rick Carver Realty.

01:46:42.979 --> 01:46:45.398
- Is Rick Carver here today?
- There he is right there.

01:46:54.408 --> 01:46:56.242
That's a hell of a thing you did, son.
