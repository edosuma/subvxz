00:18.018 --> 00:19.728
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.147
I'm gonna count to three.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.442
One, two...

00:23.525 --> 00:24.525
He's dead.

00:24.526 --> 00:26.693
- No, he's not.
- Yeah, he is.

00:26.778 --> 00:28.278
I didn't mean to do that.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.780
He's going to Mexico.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.367
You know what your father
says about fighting.

00:33.452 --> 00:35.453
Next time I see him in jail,
I'll be sure to ask.

00:35.537 --> 00:38.080
- You got kids?
- A son, 14.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.833
Check it out. Thought you might
wanna play with your friends.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.210
No, thanks.

00:42.293 --> 00:45.213
Just because Nats is on the inside
doesn't mean our relationship ends.

00:45.297 --> 00:48.508
- So get him to talk!
- We're done!

00:49.300 --> 00:51.928
I cheated on you,
and I got caught by this detective,

00:52.012 --> 00:54.847
and she told me if didn't tell her stuff,
she would tell you.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.433
- What did you say to her?
- Just about the fentanyl but...

00:57.517 --> 00:59.685
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Keep your mouth shut!

00:59.768 --> 01:01.813
Teresa and I, we want to know

01:01.897 --> 01:04.440
why it is that you have not
expanded into fentanyl.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.360
<i>We wanna talk to you
about the fentanyl business.</i>

01:07.443 --> 01:09.487
I want you to get distribution up
and running.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.572
<i>Serena's family
runs an escort service</i>

01:11.655 --> 01:13.115
out of a massage parlour downtown.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.243
<i>They run a string of dealers
in the schools,</i>

01:15.327 --> 01:16.828
bring in 200 grand a month.

01:16.912 --> 01:18.997
If they can't follow through
with what we need,

01:19.080 --> 01:21.082
they will be easy enough to replace.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.085
You're in the middle of a war here.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.878
Our deal with you is over.

01:25.962 --> 01:28.255
Maybe you should walk away.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.717
Just leave it all.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.807
<i>In any business,
there are good times and bad.</i>

01:36.890 --> 01:38.975
<i>But in my business, you never look back.</i>

01:39.058 --> 01:40.727
<i>You bury the bodies and you move on.</i>

01:40.810 --> 01:43.145
My man, I always count on you
for the good shit.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.232
There's more coming down the line.
I got you all covered.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.322
<i>With the cartel in the past,</i>

01:52.405 --> 01:54.198
<i>now I had to get things
up and running again.</i>

01:54.282 --> 01:56.993
<i>If I didn't, the twins would take over
the market and Montreal.</i>

01:57.077 --> 01:59.787
<i>So I turned to old sources
to keep a steady supply coming in</i>

01:59.870 --> 02:01.538
<i>from New York up to Rose's reserve,</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:04.292
<i>which worked as smooth
as she said it would.</i>

02:05.418 --> 02:06.710
Vitamin C.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.465
That's 90% pure. Perfect. Unload.

02:12.425 --> 02:15.470
<i>Her brother Twix
ran the shipments with his guys</i>

02:15.553 --> 02:18.388
<i>through the reserve
across the river, back up to Quebec.</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:23.310
Liam, why are you so grumpy?
You got a full head of hair.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.688
You're somewhat handsome.
Business is good.

02:25.772 --> 02:27.190
I even think you've grown an inch,

02:27.273 --> 02:29.483
unless you got lifts on,
you sneaky bugger.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.527
Next time, we meet close to me.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.615
I hate driving out to this dump
in the middle of nowhere.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.660
<i>Reggie wasn't doing great
after what happened on the boat,</i>

02:39.743 --> 02:41.412
<i>but I didn't have time to babysit.</i>

02:41.495 --> 02:43.623
<i>Shelley was watching the Cosoletos</i>

02:43.707 --> 02:45.208
<i>to track down the twins for me,</i>

02:45.292 --> 02:47.252
<i>and I was keeping that
money train running.</i>

02:56.677 --> 02:58.262
Things are gonna be moving fast.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.223
I've got another load coming in a week.

03:00.307 --> 03:01.892
Keep that phone on 24/7.

03:03.685 --> 03:05.478
This is not 20 keys.

03:05.562 --> 03:07.813
No, it's not,
but I got another shipment lined up.

03:07.897 --> 03:10.400
- You'll get the other 10 and more.
- Good.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.902
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

03:15.530 --> 03:18.783
You did good. No hassles.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.537
Everything worked
exactly the way you said it would.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.375
As long as you remember one thing...

03:28.083 --> 03:30.545
you do every run like it's your first.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.673
When's our next run?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.222
Declan, you know I've always trusted you,

03:41.305 --> 03:43.182
but ever since that cop disappeared,

03:43.265 --> 03:45.560
I've got Port Authority
crawling all over the place.

03:45.643 --> 03:47.853
<i>There's undercover cops here 24/7.</i>

03:47.937 --> 03:50.273
<i>You can't bring anything through here.</i>

03:50.357 --> 03:52.733
It's all gonna pass.
And when it does, we got a deal.

03:52.817 --> 03:53.943
<i>Of course we do.</i>

03:54.027 --> 03:55.778
But they're all over the place.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.280
My hands are tied.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.918
Nice dahlias.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.587
You know your flowers?

04:13.672 --> 04:17.632
Ah, when I was inside,
there was this guy, Ernesto,

04:17.716 --> 04:19.927
350 pounds, from El Salvador,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.012
huge anger-management issues.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.223
But I knew Ernesto from the outside.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.225
He did some muscle work for me and Vito.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.435
And I knew he loved his flowers.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.103
So I told the warden,

04:30.187 --> 04:32.648
"Why don't you get a little plot
in the prison yard

04:32.732 --> 04:34.525
so he can garden?"

04:34.608 --> 04:37.403
Ernesto never punched anyone again, ever.

04:37.487 --> 04:40.407
Well, I'm sure that earned you
a lot of good favour with the warden.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.867
No, it earned me
a lot of good favour with Ernesto.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.995
When you're inside,
you need a 350-pound El Salvadorian,

04:46.078 --> 04:47.413
not a warden.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.708
I got a new shipment coming soon.
I'm making arrangements now.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.418
- Just tell me when. We'll be ready.
- OK.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.840
Massage the earth with your hands.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.092
- That's what Ernesto told me.
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.475
Rose! Twix!

05:08.558 --> 05:10.353
Anybody! Help!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.022
Help!

05:15.023 --> 05:16.025
Rose!

05:22.782 --> 05:24.575
Oh, Wes!

05:24.658 --> 05:27.703
Wes! Wes, wake up! Wake up, Wes!

05:27.787 --> 05:29.788
Oh. No, no, no!

05:31.248 --> 05:32.542
No!

05:32.625 --> 05:34.585
Wake up, Wes! Wes!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.753
Wes. Please wake up.

06:25.637 --> 06:27.472
Are you the boy's next of kin?

06:27.555 --> 06:30.517
His dad's in prison. I'm his guardian.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.310
Were you aware he was using drugs?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.520
No.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.148
It's my understanding the body stays here?

06:39.442 --> 06:41.068
Yeah.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.112
He's never to be left alone.

06:43.863 --> 06:45.657
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.755
This is all my fault.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.883
I should've known he was using.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.218
Did you know?

07:08.012 --> 07:09.597
No.

07:11.015 --> 07:13.517
I offered him a joint once,
but he didn't want any.

07:18.147 --> 07:21.567
Go to the centre.
I need you to be with Wes.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.402
Where are you going?

07:23.485 --> 07:24.987
To see Bobby.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.158
Sorry for your loss.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.795
So sorry, Rose.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.923
He was doing coke.

07:44.007 --> 07:47.510
The cops told me that someone
put fentanyl in the drugs.

07:48.887 --> 07:51.805
Who would do that?
Who would put poison in drugs?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.348
Yeah.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.477
Everything stops.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.645
Nothing moves through here.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.065
The drugs, nothing.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.108
Not until we find out who did this to Wes.

08:12.410 --> 08:13.995
Yeah.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.505
Plans have changed.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.717
The reservation is now shut down.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.885
We have to drive it all
across the border now.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.011
- It's risky, eh?
- That's right.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.472
You're gonna need three trucks,
hidden compartments.

08:34.557 --> 08:37.268
Each truck goes through
a separate border crossing, alright?

08:37.352 --> 08:40.352
If one gets stopped,
we still got two more, minimize our risk.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.773
Three trucks, three drivers,
triple the cost.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.192
No problem.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.610
Your best drivers, alright?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.445
It's gonna go smooth.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.157
If anyone gets busted,
I'll handle the payouts.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.993
No matter what, gotta keep things moving.

08:54.077 --> 08:55.912
That's more than enough.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.372
Alright?

09:03.168 --> 09:05.170
Can you believe this?

09:05.755 --> 09:08.798
Eight fentanyl overdoses
over the weekend in Hamilton.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.302
You know, I heard on the radio too,
there was a couple kids

09:11.385 --> 09:12.470
they found on a reserve.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.805
Didn't I tell you?
It's only gonna get worse.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.473
It's a goddamn disaster.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.475
Hey. How's it going?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.352
Pop, you catch the game last night?

09:20.435 --> 09:22.772
The game?
You ever read a goddamn newspaper?

09:24.648 --> 09:27.402
All these dead kids.
You think that fentanyl came from us?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.822
Teresa and Christian
said we'd have to make adjustments.

09:30.905 --> 09:31.905
Adjustments?

09:31.988 --> 09:34.700
I don't think dead kids
are an adjustment, Luca.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.910
They're gonna set up
a task force for this.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.955
The word "dead" and "kids",
they should never go together.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.708
We're shutting it down.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.293
- You can't do that.
- We're out.

09:44.377 --> 09:46.462
- Pop, you can't shut this down.
- Excuse me?

09:46.545 --> 09:48.463
You put me in charge, remember?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.923
You said this was my thing.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.760
Yeah, that was before
we started killing children.

09:54.012 --> 09:56.805
- Children, Luca.
- What will you tell Teresa and Christian?

09:56.888 --> 09:59.183
Who are you gonna listen to?
Them or your father?

09:59.267 --> 10:00.600
Pop.

10:00.685 --> 10:02.520
Addicts OD.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.272
This stuff happens, OK?
You can't shut this down for this.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.692
It'll blow over.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.277
OK. Pay attention.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.573
This, this isn't just about business.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.783
These cops are gonna shake down everybody,

10:16.867 --> 10:19.828
junkies, dealers, corner boys.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.080
This is now politics, not business.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.543
I need you to listen to me.
Hey, look at me.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.588
We lost one son already. We lost one son.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.423
We're not doing it again.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.633
Mm-hmm, well, I can handle this, OK?

10:33.717 --> 10:36.012
Hey, you listen to him. He's your father.

10:36.095 --> 10:37.638
End of the story here, Luca.

10:37.722 --> 10:40.725
Go to the store,
count the receipts from last night.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.810
Come on.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.210
I heard about your boy,

11:08.293 --> 11:10.045
about his tragic death.

11:11.547 --> 11:12.840
I can't imagine.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.010
My condolences, Bobby.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.728
Bobby, you got a visitor.

11:25.812 --> 11:27.438
It's your sister.

11:38.032 --> 11:40.575
He, uh, he says
he doesn't wanna see you,

11:40.658 --> 11:42.745
and you shouldn't come back.

12:02.557 --> 12:04.057
Hey, Reg?

12:09.188 --> 12:10.563
Hey.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.572
Hey, sunshine.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.075
Hey, wanna get something to eat?

12:22.033 --> 12:24.328
No, I'm not hungry, thank you.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.417
We gotta get you cooking again.

12:31.377 --> 12:32.878
What did you do all day?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.467
- Did you get out?
- No, not today.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.885
No.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.597
You taking your meds?

12:43.638 --> 12:45.390
Maybe we gotta get you something else.

12:46.017 --> 12:47.768
I got a doctor you can go see.

12:47.852 --> 12:50.687
- No, it's fine.
- No, it's not fine, Reggie.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.568
That wasn't your fault.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.073
You ever killed anyone before?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.507
You gotta put that out of your mind.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.885
Tell yourself it was someone else
who did that, not you.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.555
That was me, though.

13:38.277 --> 13:39.862
It's me.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.462
His clothes,
they were just piled on his floor.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.257
Hey, you don't have to do that now.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.508
I have to do something.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.802
It's OK.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.387
Let's sit.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.900
When you were a teenager,

14:19.610 --> 14:22.905
could anyone stop you from doing
whatever you wanted to do?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.533
- No.
- No.

14:26.617 --> 14:27.952
But I didn't die.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.542
I have to ask you,
your product, is it clean?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.460
You let me into your home.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.588
I always test my product, Rose.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.215
I would never, ever

14:42.298 --> 14:45.135
cut my stuff with anything lethal.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
Just wouldn't do it.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.390
Bobby trusted me to take care of his son.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.977
I wanna find out who did this to him.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.060
Then what?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.648
What are you gonna do?
It's never one person.

14:57.732 --> 14:59.793
Are you gonna kill every
drug dealer up and down the line?

14:59.817 --> 15:03.153
No, someone decided
to lace that shit with fentanyl,

15:03.237 --> 15:04.697
and I wanna find them.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.785
You got Wes's phone?

15:10.868 --> 15:11.912
Yeah.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.583
He was attached to that thing.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.877
I should've taken it away.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.043
You know the password?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.628
1-2-1-2.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.717
I was paying for it,
had to know the password.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.348
- Cinnamon Girl, do you know who that is?
- No.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.832
He met her at 2:00 a.m. last night.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.060
Let's call it.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.020
Hey, hey, hey. You don't call.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.523
Go to settings,

15:39.607 --> 15:41.650
then you go to location services,

15:42.608 --> 15:44.362
you scroll,

15:44.445 --> 15:46.988
and it tells you where he was.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.035
I'm gonna help you find who did this.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.830
Let's start by finding Cinnamon Girl.

15:59.752 --> 16:01.462
Hey, how you doing?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.465
So, what are we doing here?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.760
You take us to go fishing?

16:07.843 --> 16:10.220
Ah, I appreciate you two guys coming here.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.430
I just need, like, a moment of your time.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.725
First, let's talk about Declan.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.518
He's still selling drugs.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.062
I want to know how he's getting them in,

16:19.145 --> 16:21.065
and why is it that
we have not found him yet?

16:21.148 --> 16:23.858
I got people looking under rocks,
over rooftops.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.695
We'll find him.
And as to how he's bringing in drugs,

16:26.778 --> 16:29.407
carrier pigeon or donkey,
I don't know that.

16:29.490 --> 16:31.992
I don't know.
That's not why I brought you guys here.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.037
We're gonna shut down
this fentanyl stuff. It's too hot.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.038
Now's not the time.

16:38.082 --> 16:40.542
I assume this is because of the headlines?

16:40.625 --> 16:43.045
Yeah, the speeches from the mayor,

16:43.128 --> 16:44.880
the police commissioner, the premier.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.090
Your stuff's not ready.
I think you guys know that.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.302
I told you, there are always obstacles
to work out in production.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.638
I just don't think you jeopardize
an entire family over something like this.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.223
You know, you don't do that.

16:55.307 --> 16:58.227
Are you just worried about your son? Hmm?

16:58.310 --> 17:01.855
Or maybe it's something more personal.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.232
Like what?

17:03.315 --> 17:04.817
Well, it's not easy to let go,

17:04.900 --> 17:08.112
and you have been doing things
a certain way for a long time,

17:09.069 --> 17:11.156
and this is new, foreign.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.490
Hmm...

17:13.867 --> 17:16.662
You two sold a product
that brought the heat.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.663
I'm just putting out the fire.

17:19.415 --> 17:21.541
Look, I know it's not easy
admitting you're wrong

17:21.625 --> 17:23.835
when you guys have been,
you know, right for so long,

17:23.917 --> 17:25.502
but sometimes that's just how it goes.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.340
What does Luca say about this?

17:29.425 --> 17:31.177
Luca answers to me.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.818
Nats.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.115
Ah!

17:57.160 --> 17:58.662
Don't.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.038
I'm sorry.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.417
- I just wanna take you home.
- I know.

18:04.502 --> 18:07.212
I know, but don't worry, OK? I'm OK.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.713
<i>How's Valentina doing?</i>

18:08.797 --> 18:10.382
<i>Coping... sort of.</i>

18:10.465 --> 18:13.427
<i>Yeah, I try to take the kid
whenever I can,</i>

18:13.510 --> 18:14.887
<i>to give her a break.</i>

18:14.970 --> 18:17.305
<i>I need to ask you to do something for me.</i>

18:18.223 --> 18:19.475
Anything.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.728
I need you to promise
that you will protect her,

18:23.812 --> 18:25.730
that you will take care of her.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.523
Of course I'll take care of her.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.733
Not just money, Pop.

18:28.817 --> 18:32.362
I need you to swear on Ma's grave

18:33.488 --> 18:35.157
that no matter what happens,

18:35.240 --> 18:38.202
you will protect her and Adamo.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.328
Cos I'm gone now,

18:41.622 --> 18:42.873
and he needs her.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.627
So I need you to swear.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.757
You listen to me.

18:52.842 --> 18:55.177
I swear...

18:55.260 --> 18:57.762
I will protect her and Adamo

18:57.847 --> 18:59.430
no matter what.

18:59.515 --> 19:00.765
Thank you.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.935
Wow.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.983
There's not a word
about Val talking to us.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.068
He's protecting her.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.655
Yeah. You're not surprised?

19:15.655 --> 19:18.200
Nats understands
that if he says anything, she's dead,

19:18.283 --> 19:19.827
even if it's his wife.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.120
The family couldn't let a snitch live.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.998
So, what are you thinking?

19:26.082 --> 19:28.210
We might have some leverage here.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.050
I love diners like this.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.387
I mean,
there's hardly any of them around anymore.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.100
Every time a diner closes in Montreal,

19:43.183 --> 19:46.520
it's like the whole neighbourhood suffers,
like we lose a generation.

19:48.147 --> 19:50.440
- My dad used to take me here.
- Really?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.817
Ah, he'd order the hamburger steak.

19:52.902 --> 19:54.695
Can't believe this place is still open.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.655
They used to have jukeboxes at the tables.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.323
Can you imagine that now,

19:58.407 --> 20:00.783
every table playing its own music loud?

20:01.452 --> 20:03.370
We're dating ourselves.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.080
Ah, come on, you're a baby, if that.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.208
I like this place.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.503
Why don't you buy it, keep it around?

20:12.587 --> 20:16.048
No, I have enough on my plate.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.885
Why are you helping me?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.430
Because I want to.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.978
Because losing someone like that,
you never really get over.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.985
You know, I gotta tell you,

20:36.068 --> 20:38.905
my little sister, Reggie's mum,

20:40.115 --> 20:42.117
she was 18 when she OD'd.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.413
We were little kids. Foster care homes.
We got separated.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.415
I didn't see her for years.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.543
And when I finally found her,
she, uh, she was a junkie.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.465
Before I could help her, she was dead.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.260
I was a very angry young man,

21:01.345 --> 21:02.720
and, uh,

21:03.513 --> 21:06.517
losing her was like a, like a robbery.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.477
She was all I had left

21:09.560 --> 21:11.397
after having less than nothing before.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.857
Took me a long time to get over that.

21:14.942 --> 21:17.527
You think going after someone
would've made you feel better?

21:18.862 --> 21:20.197
Yeah.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.615
Hmm...

21:23.742 --> 21:25.660
- Would you, uh, like some more coffee?
- Yeah.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.208
That's good.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.752
Ma'am?

21:33.835 --> 21:35.962
- No, thanks.
- OK.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.553
Bob, I'm going on my break.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.858
Wanna get some air?

21:58.735 --> 22:00.195
Cinnamon Girl.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.115
You scared the heck out of me.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.825
Favourite song or girlfriend?

22:06.785 --> 22:08.912
Hey, look, man,
I got ten minutes for a smoke break.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.415
If you want something,
go back inside and ask the cook, OK?

22:11.498 --> 22:14.167
You got a pretty lucrative side business
going on in there, huh?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.293
Nice.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.337
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.713
We're not cops.

22:18.797 --> 22:20.465
Oh, I can tell that.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.510
You sold some drugs last night
to a kid named Wes,

22:25.428 --> 22:26.472
right?

22:26.555 --> 22:28.140
Ah, I don't know any kids.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.598
He OD'd, you piece of shit.

22:30.767 --> 22:31.810
Right?

22:32.768 --> 22:35.022
I'm sorry to hear that.
Look, I gotta get back inside.

22:35.105 --> 22:37.273
- Nah, we're just talking.
- Bug off, alright?

22:43.322 --> 22:46.282
- Hey. Hey. You cut your own stuff?
- No. No. Get off me, man!

22:46.365 --> 22:49.077
- Who cut your stuff?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.287
- Do you cut your own stuff?
- Answer him.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.747
Easy. Easy. Easy.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.582
Take it easy, alright? Hang on.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.835
That batch you're selling,
it was cut with fentanyl.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.045
Dump it.

23:00.047 --> 23:02.507
Oh. She, she said
it was gonna be different.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.177
- Who's she? What's her name?
- I didn't know.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.595
- I'm not telling you anymore.
- Come on, who is she?

23:07.678 --> 23:08.847
Oh, God.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.517
Stop it. Get off me.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.312
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.398
OK, listen to me.

23:18.482 --> 23:20.275
Cinnamon Girl, listen to me.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.777
I feel like I'm getting to know you now.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.405
Trust me, you do not wanna get to know me.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.448
Tell me everything.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.118
Names, places, people, times.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.790
Her name is Serena.

23:34.873 --> 23:37.583
She's 5' 6". She's a redhead.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.795
She runs,
she runs a massage parlour up in Hamilton.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.172
- A massage parlour?
- Yeah.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.465
In Ontario?

23:43.548 --> 23:46.383
I go up there once a month
to make, to make a pickup.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.470
There you go, Cinnamon. Thank you.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.723
Come on, Rose. We're going to Hamilton.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.480
I really hate these places.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.108
I don't know.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.403
Being able to scratch an itch
without any bullshit.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.447
Sounds pretty good to me.

24:08.782 --> 24:11.242
It's a service economy,
and I'm a busy woman.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.577
Alright.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.002
Where is Declan
getting his product, hmm?

24:21.085 --> 24:23.172
How is he getting it in?

24:23.255 --> 24:24.840
Bella, you are smoking too much.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.967
Why don't you go for a run?

24:27.050 --> 24:28.718
You'll feel better.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.763
No, we need to see
who in Montreal we can get on our side.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.978
Luca wants to meet.

24:39.062 --> 24:41.230
I just scheduled a massage.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.982
Why don't you just go?

24:43.065 --> 24:45.568
He just wants to see you anyway.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.673
Hey, diner guy said redhead. Let's go.

25:07.757 --> 25:11.052
Wait, I've seen her before
from Shelley's surveillance pics.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.678
Shut the door.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.227
That's her.

25:18.310 --> 25:21.437
And that is Luca Cosoleto.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.982
He's who we're going after.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.617
Hello, Luca.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.912
Where's Christian?

25:36.995 --> 25:38.622
Attending to other matters.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.290
Did you just wanna see me alone?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.542
You asked to see me.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.127
Come on.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.712
You like me a little.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.923
How was your date?

25:49.007 --> 25:51.133
You're a good <i>consigliere.</i>
I give it to you.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.428
Mm-hmm.
So, what do you want to talk about?

25:55.305 --> 25:57.598
Pop says we're out, OK, but I'm still in.

25:58.892 --> 25:59.977
Really?

26:00.935 --> 26:02.478
I understand where he's coming from.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.940
You know, he's just got a lot
on his plate right now, OK?

26:05.732 --> 26:08.150
It's easier for him to put the freeze
on this type of stuff.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.737
But I know this is too big to drop.

26:11.822 --> 26:14.115
I'm never in favour
of going behind anyone's back.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.783
Neither am I, OK? But I know my father.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.785
Right now, with Nats,
this mess with Declan,

26:17.868 --> 26:20.205
getting used to you two,
trust me, if I push him too hard,

26:20.288 --> 26:21.832
he'll never wanna hear from it again.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.335
So I think we keep moving, OK?

26:26.418 --> 26:29.172
Once he sees the kind of money
it's gonna bring in,

26:29.255 --> 26:30.757
he'll turn around.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.638
I think you should stand
by your father's decision.

26:38.682 --> 26:42.060
Hey. I'm not gonna miss out
on this, Teresa.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.230
OK? If I'm out,
you're gonna find someone else.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.023
- I will.
- So I'm in.

26:48.567 --> 26:51.235
You want it, it's yours.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.743
- Luca?
- Yeah.

26:58.827 --> 27:01.287
I need you to do a little research for me.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.123
We need more allies in Montreal.

27:08.337 --> 27:10.880
This is obviously a drug exchange.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.048
Mums and housewives,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.052
it's good cover.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.552
Where's he picking up?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.180
Where's it being made?
I want the production house.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.058
I saw him pick up those bags
in a residential area.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.895
But he parked and walked through
some backyards and alleys.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.980
Stayed with her until he came back,

27:28.063 --> 27:30.108
so I don't know the exact house.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.358
Let's go after him.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.818
- No.
- Why not?

27:32.902 --> 27:34.862
Why not? Cos he's nothing. He's a nobody.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.488
He's just following orders.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.073
Remember what we talked about?

27:38.157 --> 27:39.950
Teresa and Christian are who you want.

27:40.035 --> 27:42.328
Vinnie Barbarino here, he's just there

27:42.412 --> 27:43.955
to help us get close to them.

27:44.038 --> 27:45.915
How do we get him to go back there?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.833
Supply and demand.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.547
Hey, Cinnamon. Hey, hey.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.382
Hey, come on, let me go.

27:54.465 --> 27:55.901
I told you
what you wanted to know, alright?

27:55.925 --> 27:58.052
You did, thank you.
We got a good thing going here.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.055
Now, I need you to place an order.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.432
I can't do that. It's not the right time.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.600
Besides I don't order that much.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.353
Oh, tell her it's spring break.
Tell her demand is high.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.230
We need it now, and we need a lot.

28:09.313 --> 28:12.108
I'll cover the cost,
and when you get it, you burn it.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.818
OK, alright.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.658
Spring break.

28:20.742 --> 28:21.952
That's it.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.622
So, how is Declan bringing in the supply

28:26.705 --> 28:28.207
that he's selling to you?

28:28.290 --> 28:31.168
It ain't the port.
That's shut down for now.

28:32.253 --> 28:33.295
I don't know.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.548
Most likely he's doing it old school,
over the border.

28:37.342 --> 28:40.052
Quality seems to match
what he used to get out of Chicago.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.387
Hmm...

28:41.470 --> 28:43.723
Well, we want you to only buy from us.

28:43.807 --> 28:47.352
No more Declan. Shut him out.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.353
Now, uh,

28:49.437 --> 28:51.898
I got no love for Declan.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.443
But when I need product,

28:56.360 --> 28:57.737
I want a deal.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.493
We'll cut the going rate.
That's not a problem.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.247
Just get to it, man.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.873
What do you really want, huh?

29:09.957 --> 29:11.835
What would make this irresistible?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.670
The port.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.050
My people had been controlling
the port for decades

29:19.133 --> 29:21.385
until that bastard came along.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.055
I want it back.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.432
We will get the port for you.

29:28.768 --> 29:32.188
And the next time you see Declan,
you kill him.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.195
Right.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.452
Well done, Luca.

29:47.287 --> 29:48.747
What's next?

29:48.830 --> 29:51.665
Does your family
have contacts at border control?

29:51.748 --> 29:53.710
Of course. Why?

29:54.752 --> 29:56.545
Well, you heard what he said.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.465
For the next month, we have to make sure

29:59.548 --> 30:02.135
that every truck crossing the US border

30:02.218 --> 30:04.345
to Montreal is searched.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.515
Nothing, and I mean nothing, gets through.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.308
That's gonna cost a bundle.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.893
It's practically free

30:10.977 --> 30:13.647
compared to what we will be making
on the other side.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.110
Well, consider it done.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.072
After you.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.805
Hi, Enzo.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.265
I don't know you.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.017
Nellie Bullock, RCMP.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.477
Can we talk for a few minutes?

30:52.560 --> 30:53.812
No.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.522
It's about your son.

31:00.235 --> 31:01.568
<i>You didn't mess up.</i>

31:01.652 --> 31:02.778
<i>I cheated on you.</i>

31:02.862 --> 31:04.822
<i>- You what?
- I cheated on you,</i>

31:04.905 --> 31:06.615
<i>and I got caught by this detective,</i>

31:06.698 --> 31:08.785
<i>and she told me
if I didn't tell her stuff,</i>

31:08.868 --> 31:10.035
<i>she would tell you.</i>

31:10.118 --> 31:11.703
<i>Hey, what did you say to her?</i>

31:11.787 --> 31:13.538
<i>Nothing, honestly...</i>

31:15.958 --> 31:18.460
You get off listening
to people's private conversations?

31:18.543 --> 31:20.547
I'm thinking Nats doesn't trust you.

31:20.630 --> 31:23.423
My son trusts me.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.677
Really? He didn't tell you
that his wife was cheating.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.555
He didn't tell you
that his wife was snitching.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.265
I wonder what else he hasn't told you.

31:31.348 --> 31:34.102
Are we done? Cos I'm done.

31:34.185 --> 31:37.313
I know everything, about the kidnapping,

31:37.397 --> 31:40.148
how Teresa and Christian
are muscling you all into fentanyl.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.527
I run a banquet hall.
Weddings, baby showers...

31:43.612 --> 31:45.530
Look, let's cut the act.

31:45.613 --> 31:48.115
I know who you are. You know what I am.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.075
I'm not going after you.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.453
I'm here to make you an offer.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.873
Say the word,
and I put your grandson and Valentina

31:55.957 --> 31:57.208
in witness protection.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.252
You promised Nats.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.628
You swore you'd protect them.

32:02.672 --> 32:05.300
Then tell us everything you know
about Teresa and Christian.

32:05.383 --> 32:08.343
Give me enough to indict them.
Protect your family.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.970
It's a win-win.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.808
Or I could play this tape
for your brother, Domenic.

32:14.517 --> 32:17.062
How much longer do you think
Adamo's gonna have a mother

32:17.145 --> 32:19.272
when the rest of them
find out she's a rat?

32:20.857 --> 32:22.275
What's your name again?

32:23.067 --> 32:24.402
Nellie Bullock.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.488
Well, Nellie Bullock...

32:28.530 --> 32:29.990
kiss my ass.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.577
You too, nimrod.

32:33.662 --> 32:35.705
Get the hell out of my house.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.088
Come on, let's go. Get out.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.692
I'm gonna take this.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.610
- Yeah?
- My trucks can't get through.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.528
What are you talking about?

33:08.612 --> 33:11.365
<i>They dialled up security to ten
at all the crossings.</i>

33:11.448 --> 33:14.243
I never seen anything like it.
They got sniffer dogs.

33:14.327 --> 33:16.245
They're making every single truck unload.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.455
It's backed up for miles.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.165
- Why?
- <i>Something's going on.</i>

33:20.248 --> 33:22.877
<i>So I checked with a guy I know
that works at the border.</i>

33:22.960 --> 33:25.380
<i>This is gonna go on for weeks.
No end date.</i>

33:25.463 --> 33:29.050
- Highest priority, drug confiscations.
- <i>Damn it.</i>

33:29.133 --> 33:31.343
<i>Yeah, well,
when you get the reserve back open,</i>

33:31.427 --> 33:33.428
<i>let me know, cos we can't do it like this.</i>

33:33.512 --> 33:34.763
Sure.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.100
What's going on?

33:38.183 --> 33:40.185
Hang on, hang on.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.687
Talk to me.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.815
Luca Cosoleto.

33:43.898 --> 33:46.608
I got him, and their production house.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.360
- It's a church.
- <i>Good.</i>

33:48.443 --> 33:49.862
You know what to do.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.073
That was Shelley.

33:53.157 --> 33:55.660
She found it, their production house.

33:57.745 --> 33:58.872
Good.

33:58.955 --> 34:00.832
The wait's almost over.

34:00.915 --> 34:04.293
Hi, I need to report something
to the organized crime division.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.514
Can I ask you ladies
to stay here for minute, if that's OK?

34:17.598 --> 34:19.016
- OK.
- Cool.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.647
That's a hell of a bust.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.815
Yeah.

34:27.567 --> 34:30.862
I was expecting a little more
"ra-ra, drop the mic" attitude.

34:30.945 --> 34:33.737
An anonymous tip called in
directly to our division

34:33.822 --> 34:36.074
telling us
that this is a Cosoleto operation?

34:37.952 --> 34:39.745
This isn't a concerned citizen.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.290
You get a tip like this,
it's from a competitor.

34:42.373 --> 34:43.917
Like who?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.252
Who are the Cosoletos at war with? Declan.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.255
Well, I don't know.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.757
He probably would've blown up the place,
no?

34:51.840 --> 34:54.260
Either way, this'll buy you
some points with the captain.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.137
OK, right now a gangster is running

34:56.219 --> 34:57.847
a better investigation than we are.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.098
That should piss you off.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.935
Not much other
than the equipment in there.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.103
I found this.

35:04.187 --> 35:05.437
Check it for prints.

35:05.522 --> 35:06.730
Thanks.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.612
Go ahead, call the captain.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.490
Give him the good news.

35:20.995 --> 35:22.955
How did this happen?

35:23.038 --> 35:25.207
How would I know?
We weren't even involved.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.210
Luca, when is the last time
you were at the church?

35:29.003 --> 35:30.547
About two in the morning.

35:30.630 --> 35:33.048
Luca, wait a minute. You went back there?

35:33.132 --> 35:36.385
Why did you go back there?
There wasn't a scheduled pickup.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.345
Serena called for an extra order.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.180
Yeah, double her usual numbers.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.517
I wanted to cash in. It makes sense, no?

35:42.600 --> 35:45.018
And it never occurred to you
that it was a setup?

35:46.353 --> 35:47.605
No.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.525
When one of your distributors

35:51.608 --> 35:53.652
has a sudden variation in numbers,

35:53.735 --> 35:56.822
that's a red flag, not a gift.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.160
When something like this happens,

36:01.243 --> 36:03.412
we eliminate everyone involved.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.455
We don't take chances.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.040
Now, here's the thing.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.960
Nobody's gonna touch my son.
You understand?

36:10.043 --> 36:13.505
You're not gonna talk about it.
You're not gonna think about it.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.092
I'm sure your father would feel the same.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.677
Hmm...

36:18.677 --> 36:20.137
Luca is fine.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.685
But you, you are back
in the distribution business with us.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.603
You will listen to our every word
and direction.

36:28.687 --> 36:32.148
And if not, well,
we can revisit this matter.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.710
Pop, let me explain.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.127
Shut up.

37:01.345 --> 37:03.973
Enzo, what are you doing here?

37:04.057 --> 37:06.100
Is Adamo with your mother?

37:07.058 --> 37:09.062
Yeah, like every Wednesday night.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.357
Why you let that drunk
watch over my grandson,

37:12.440 --> 37:13.732
I'll never understand.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.693
Enzo, stop. I don't wanna talk about this.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.820
No, but you like to talk, don't you?

37:18.778 --> 37:20.447
You talked to the cops.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.077
You talked to the cops!

37:25.620 --> 37:26.995
Enzo, I'm sorry.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.830
Shut up, you're sorry.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.125
"Sorry" is not what I wanna
hear from you right now.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.418
You tell me what you said,
every goddamn word.

37:35.922 --> 37:38.423
Nothing, just what Nats told me.

37:38.507 --> 37:39.967
Do I know what Nats told you?

37:40.050 --> 37:41.552
Tell me what you said.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.305
Tell me what you said!

37:45.388 --> 37:46.682
Fentanyl.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.143
Just that they want you
to get into fentanyl.

37:49.227 --> 37:50.518
- Oh, "they"?
- That's it.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.855
So you told them about
Teresa and Christian.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.107
Goddammit.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.072
What did Nats tell you?

38:02.155 --> 38:03.365
Nats didn't say anything.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.533
He didn't say anything

38:04.617 --> 38:06.327
because he wants his son to have a mother.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.245
It's that cop who came to me. To me.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.997
Do you understand what you've done?

38:10.080 --> 38:12.248
The whole family could get locked up,
everyone.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.627
I told that witch to go to hell.
I swear to God.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.005
- Please Enzo...
- Oh yeah, "please."

38:18.088 --> 38:19.007
Sorry?

38:19.090 --> 38:21.925
You weren't so sorry when
you were screwing that <i>sciocco, </i> were you?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.222
OK, that wasn't right. It wasn't right.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.142
But you're not in our marriage.
You don't know what it's like.

38:30.225 --> 38:33.020
A person's allowed to be unhappy.

38:33.103 --> 38:35.272
I know what it means talk to the cops.
I'm not stupid.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.067
But you don't get to crucify me
for not being a perfect wife

38:38.150 --> 38:39.235
for five minutes.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.112
Oh, you think any marriage is perfect?

38:41.195 --> 38:42.905
My wife, God rest her soul,

38:44.240 --> 38:46.908
was a pain in my ass
every day of her life,

38:46.992 --> 38:48.702
but I never screwed around on her.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.120
I never screwed around on her.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.997
- Well, aren't you the saint.
- Shut up.

39:00.047 --> 39:02.425
Are you gonna tell Domenic?

39:04.718 --> 39:07.847
I promised my son
that I would protect you.

39:07.930 --> 39:10.432
And I'm keeping that promise,

39:10.515 --> 39:12.768
for Adamo, nothing else.

39:12.852 --> 39:14.812
If that cop comes to you again,

39:14.895 --> 39:17.230
you shut up and tell me.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.735
If anyone asks about this,
you play stupid.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.738
OK.

39:28.117 --> 39:30.577
I love Nats, OK? I do.

39:33.497 --> 39:35.582
I was just going through
a really hard time and...

39:37.543 --> 39:39.253
I don't care why you did it.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.755
You did it.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.467
Nothing else matters.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.315
That was a really nice service.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.987
I was talking to one of your neighbours.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.113
Lisa?

40:08.448 --> 40:12.160
The one whose son is a friend of Wes's.

40:12.870 --> 40:14.747
She was telling me

40:14.830 --> 40:17.792
she lost her job over this past year,

40:17.875 --> 40:19.293
and money's tight.

40:19.377 --> 40:21.087
But...

40:22.295 --> 40:24.215
every week,

40:24.298 --> 40:26.425
she'd find a bag of groceries
on her porch.

40:27.968 --> 40:29.345
From Wes.

40:30.930 --> 40:33.473
I know you think you didn't know that boy,

40:33.557 --> 40:36.560
but that's who he was.

40:37.853 --> 40:41.065
That's the kind of man he was becoming.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.150
Be proud of that.

40:54.703 --> 40:56.705
I wanna destroy those bastards,

40:56.788 --> 40:58.373
every last one of them,

40:58.457 --> 41:00.708
and we gotta have money to do it.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.087
Bring it through.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.555
Aw, shit.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.477
Hey, listen,
we put a freeze on everything here.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.937
We know.

41:21.772 --> 41:24.608
But we wanted to talk to you
about the Irish.

41:24.692 --> 41:27.612
We think it's time they stepped in again.

41:27.695 --> 41:30.738
You know my situation.
I already told you. I have no say.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.323
Yes, you do.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.035
Or else we will have to involve your wife,
Alison,

41:35.118 --> 41:37.287
and your daughter, Patricia,
in all of this.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.832
That won't be pleasant for anyone.

41:39.915 --> 41:41.583
You touch them, I will kill you.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.172
You will work with the Irish.

41:47.757 --> 41:49.758
You will call Declan,

41:49.842 --> 41:52.343
and you will tell him
that he's no longer welcome.

41:53.512 --> 41:54.847
We don't say things twice.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.374
<i>The twins came to the port again.</i>

42:04.398 --> 42:05.815
- Yeah.
<i>- They're pressing hard.</i>

42:05.900 --> 42:07.735
<i>They threatened my wife and my daughter.</i>

42:07.818 --> 42:09.110
<i>They want you out,</i>

42:09.193 --> 42:11.197
<i>and they wanna put the Irish
back in place.</i>

42:19.288 --> 42:21.832
So, you tried to get the port back, huh?

42:25.293 --> 42:27.880
Well, well, look who's here.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.258
The ghost of Christmas past.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.262
Ho. Ho. Ho.

42:41.477 --> 42:43.270
Beautiful.

42:48.108 --> 42:50.818
<i>♪ We came too far to be looking back... ♪</i>

42:51.778 --> 42:53.988
The bust will barely cause a dent.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.117
They'll have another up and running
in no time.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.452
But these people, you gotta hit 'em,

42:58.535 --> 43:00.703
keep 'em off balance. It rattles them.

43:06.585 --> 43:09.212
<i>♪ And we were frozen in our steps</i> ♪

43:10.547 --> 43:13.467
<i>♪ But the light gave us a breath</i> ♪

43:14.843 --> 43:17.262
<i>♪ Vision changed from black to... ♪</i>

43:17.345 --> 43:19.138
Enzo promised his son

43:19.222 --> 43:21.433
that he would protect Valentina
no matter what.

43:21.517 --> 43:24.895
But Domenic, Domenic's old school.

43:24.978 --> 43:26.980
He can't let a rat live under his roof.

43:27.063 --> 43:29.567
<i>♪ Clouds above us clearing ♪</i>

43:31.068 --> 43:34.905
<i>♪ There's movement in the stillness ♪</i>

43:35.905 --> 43:39.368
<i>♪ Our hearts will beat the sound</i> ♪

43:39.452 --> 43:43.372
<i>♪ So we're raising our voice together ♪</i>

43:45.165 --> 43:46.792
<i>♪ No way we're standing...</i> ♪

43:46.875 --> 43:49.795
I know these people.
It's all about family.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.588
They chant it like a mantra.

43:51.672 --> 43:54.467
The only way we win is to get them

43:54.550 --> 43:57.177
to rip themselves apart from the inside.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.847
Good work
getting that recording to Domenic.

44:01.515 --> 44:04.100
I'm not sure how this is gonna turn out,

44:04.183 --> 44:06.103
but this is where it starts.

44:13.277 --> 44:15.487
- <i>You didn't mess up.
- I cheated on you.</i>

44:15.570 --> 44:17.155
<i>- You what?
- I cheated on you,</i>

44:17.238 --> 44:19.658
<i>and I got caught by this detective,</i>

44:19.742 --> 44:21.618
<i>and she told me
if I didn't tell her stuff,</i>

44:21.702 --> 44:23.203
<i>she would tell you.</i>

44:23.287 --> 44:25.372
<i>Hey, what did you say to her?</i>

44:28.667 --> 44:30.002
<i>Next time on </i> Bad Blood:

44:30.085 --> 44:33.213
That lighter, it's Teresa's.

44:33.297 --> 44:35.798
Dust it for prints.
You'll match it to hers.

44:35.882 --> 44:37.425
You'll get yourselves a warrant.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.052
We're not touching her.

44:39.135 --> 44:42.973
Enzo, if this was anybody else but Val,
it would already be done.

44:43.057 --> 44:45.017
We're not touching her.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.852
Your son killed somebody,

44:46.935 --> 44:49.772
and he did that because you sell drugs,

44:49.855 --> 44:52.942
and you beat people up
and God knows what else for a living.

44:53.025 --> 44:54.150
That's why.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.003
I wanted to see
what kind of a person you are.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.405
- And what kind am I?
- Just like me.

44:58.488 --> 45:00.198
The kind that likes to win.
