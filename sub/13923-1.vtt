00:58.766 --> 01:00.260
Ciao.

02:06.983 --> 02:08.358
Thank you.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.206
What are you doing?

02:21.003 --> 02:22.312
What?

02:22.379 --> 02:23.808
I was on the plane with you.

02:23.883 --> 02:25.606
Shit.

02:28.459 --> 02:30.532
This is for you.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.945
Hello.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.826
Hello.

04:29.611 --> 04:31.466
Is anybody here?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.241
Diana.

05:52.042 --> 05:53.417
Diana?

05:53.483 --> 05:54.377
Mmm.

05:56.842 --> 05:58.217
Hi.

05:58.283 --> 05:59.657
Lucy.

05:59.722 --> 06:02.024
Oh, Lucy.

06:02.090 --> 06:04.457
We were waiting for you to call.

06:04.522 --> 06:05.831
I got a cab.

06:05.899 --> 06:06.946
Come on in.

06:08.843 --> 06:12.138
Ian, wake up! Lucy's here!

06:14.603 --> 06:18.378
I can't get over
how grown-Up you look.

06:18.443 --> 06:21.258
I hope so, after 4 years.

06:22.762 --> 06:24.617
Is Christopher here?

06:24.682 --> 06:27.530
Well, he was supposed
to turn up yesterday...

06:27.595 --> 06:28.740
for my birthday,

06:28.811 --> 06:31.364
But he's still floating
somewhere around Turkey...

06:31.435 --> 06:33.704
with his friend Niccolo'.

06:33.770 --> 06:34.817
Niccolo' Donati.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.778
Do you remember him?

06:36.843 --> 06:37.890
Yeah.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.101
Lucy. Welcome.

06:40.171 --> 06:42.080
Welcome.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.113
Welcome.

06:47.178 --> 06:49.993
Hi. How are you?

06:50.058 --> 06:52.546
I remember all of this exactly,

06:52.618 --> 06:54.309
Just from one week.

06:54.379 --> 06:56.234
The bees.

06:56.299 --> 07:00.554
You don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

07:00.618 --> 07:03.433
See?
We fixed up the old hay barn.

07:03.498 --> 07:06.794
Only took us 20 years.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.193
When we came here first,
there was nothing -

07:09.258 --> 07:11.779
No water, no electricity.

07:11.851 --> 07:13.706
Cost us every penny we had...

07:13.771 --> 07:15.298
just to buy the place.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.542
So why'd you move here, then?

07:17.611 --> 07:18.756
Work.

07:18.827 --> 07:22.122
There's a great tradition
of art in these hills.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.019
In the room next door,

07:42.090 --> 07:45.124
You've got Alex Parrish,
old friend of ours.

07:45.195 --> 07:47.496
He knew your mother too.

07:47.563 --> 07:48.456
The writer?

07:48.523 --> 07:49.733
Been very sick.

07:50.955 --> 07:52.645
Distressing for everyone.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.136
I hope you're patient,

07:59.210 --> 08:03.007
Because... I fumble along a bit.

08:04.459 --> 08:05.474
You'll help?

08:05.546 --> 08:06.659
How?

08:06.731 --> 08:07.909
Let me look at you.

08:07.979 --> 08:09.986
Not all the time, I hope.

08:10.059 --> 08:12.131
You won't even be aware.

08:12.202 --> 08:16.326
So get settled in.
Have a swim.

08:16.394 --> 08:18.249
We eat at sunset, but...

08:18.314 --> 08:20.648
come up before.

09:46.122 --> 09:47.431
Is this your slipper?

09:47.498 --> 09:51.775
I suppose so.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.061
Do I know you?

09:53.131 --> 09:54.756
I'm Lucy.

09:54.826 --> 09:56.200
I am Guillaume.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.543
Enchante.

09:57.610 --> 09:59.137
Here for a visit?

09:59.210 --> 10:01.152
Ian's doing my portrait.

10:01.227 --> 10:02.503
It's really just an excuse...

10:02.570 --> 10:04.992
for my father to
send me to Italy...

10:05.067 --> 10:06.049
as a present.

10:06.123 --> 10:10.378
Hey, where is Signor Bruno?

10:10.442 --> 10:13.541
I have a dream to tell him.

10:13.610 --> 10:16.392
Hey, you forgot your slipper.

10:16.458 --> 10:20.452
Oh!Merci, mademoiselle!

10:20.523 --> 10:23.457
I'm going to go for a swim.
Bye.

10:23.530 --> 10:25.123
Merci.

11:45.003 --> 11:47.337
Jesus.
I thought you were drowning.

11:47.402 --> 11:48.776
I was wondering
whether I was going...

11:48.843 --> 11:50.337
to have to haul you out or not.

11:50.411 --> 11:52.233
You're Miranda.

11:52.298 --> 11:54.632
You were here before, weren't you?

11:54.699 --> 11:55.713
Four years ago.

11:55.786 --> 11:58.120
Your brother was here, not you.

11:58.187 --> 11:59.463
Well, I don't really live here,

11:59.530 --> 12:02.564
But we come every year...

12:02.635 --> 12:04.838
for Mummy's birthday
to console her.

12:04.907 --> 12:06.281
Christopher's so distracted,

12:06.346 --> 12:08.201
He couldn't quite find his way...

12:08.266 --> 12:09.640
out of Turkey.

12:09.707 --> 12:10.852
With Niccolo'.

12:10.923 --> 12:12.548
Do you know Niccolo'?

12:12.618 --> 12:13.992
From... From last time.

12:14.059 --> 12:15.652
You don't smoke by any miracle,
do you?

12:15.723 --> 12:17.097
Not really.

12:17.162 --> 12:19.104
Richard freaks out when I smoke.

12:19.178 --> 12:20.552
When are they coming back?

12:20.618 --> 12:21.895
Who?

12:21.962 --> 12:23.336
Your brother.

12:23.403 --> 12:25.457
Who knows? They said...

12:28.682 --> 12:29.576
Richard!

12:29.642 --> 12:30.787
Hi, babe.

12:30.858 --> 12:34.786
Oh, and this is...
you know, uh, harmon's...

12:34.858 --> 12:36.931
Mummy's friend's daughter.

12:37.002 --> 12:37.896
Lucy.

12:37.962 --> 12:38.944
Lucy.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.164
Oh, my God.

12:40.234 --> 12:41.990
You're Sarah harmon's daughter.

12:42.058 --> 12:44.992
Your mother was a great poet.

12:45.066 --> 12:48.066
I'm, uh, Richard Reid.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.145
Really, really honored
to meet you.

12:50.218 --> 12:52.073
It's my mother, not me.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.913
Yeah, but she made me
want to be a poet.

12:55.978 --> 12:58.313
I mean, I think it would be great,

12:58.378 --> 13:00.233
You know, just to
sit around all day...

13:00.298 --> 13:02.632
and... express yourself.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.586
Richard, I never knew
you wrote poetry.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.275
Well, honey, I never did.

13:06.346 --> 13:08.735
I don't have a creative bone
in my body.

13:08.810 --> 13:10.785
But I did become an
entertainment lawyer...

13:10.858 --> 13:12.963
so that I could be
around creative people,

13:13.034 --> 13:14.048
Like Miranda.

13:14.122 --> 13:15.497
I design jewelry.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.464
I apprentice with
this real asshole in New York.

13:18.538 --> 13:19.748
But he's a genius.

13:19.818 --> 13:20.767
Is this yours?

13:24.298 --> 13:25.672
Yes, but that's old shit.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.145
You going in?

13:27.210 --> 13:28.639
How is it in there, Lucy?

13:30.474 --> 13:31.816
Quiet as a tomb.

13:35.498 --> 13:36.643
What?

13:36.715 --> 13:39.049
No, I'm losing your voice.

13:39.114 --> 13:42.409
You sound like you're
at the bottom of the sea.

13:42.474 --> 13:45.638
Ah, ah, ah, listen to this.

14:20.106 --> 14:21.219
Who was on the phone?

14:21.291 --> 14:24.357
Miranda?
Who was on the phone?

14:24.427 --> 14:25.354
Christopher.

14:25.418 --> 14:26.727
What did he say?

14:26.795 --> 14:29.096
They're not coming back.

14:29.162 --> 14:30.340
What? Never?

14:30.410 --> 14:31.620
Well, I don't know.

14:31.690 --> 14:33.251
They... They missed
a connection or something.

14:33.323 --> 14:34.217
I couldn't hear.

14:34.283 --> 14:35.177
Those naughty boys.

14:35.243 --> 14:39.040
I bet they're being very naughty.

14:39.114 --> 14:42.180
I'm sure they've gone
beyond naughty by now.

14:52.202 --> 14:54.537
Noemi writes
a lonely hearts column...

14:54.603 --> 14:56.277
called "Tell Noemi."

14:56.342 --> 14:57.417
Ha ha ha!

14:57.483 --> 14:59.817
Has quite a following.
Oh, here it is.

14:59.882 --> 15:02.217
I have a picture
of Mom in this dress.

15:02.283 --> 15:03.657
She said after
she got married,

15:03.722 --> 15:05.097
She was going to be
fat and happy...

15:05.163 --> 15:06.788
and had no more use for it.

15:06.858 --> 15:08.451
Of course,
she never gained an ounce.

15:08.522 --> 15:09.897
Slip it on.

15:11.754 --> 15:13.729
You could wear it to the Donati's party.

15:13.803 --> 15:15.526
They give a lovely one
every summer.

15:25.738 --> 15:28.127
You could be Sarah 20 years ago...

15:28.203 --> 15:30.090
coming to help us
fix up this place.

15:30.155 --> 15:31.977
She helped you fix this place up?

15:32.043 --> 15:34.792
Well, with a lot of hash breaks.

15:36.171 --> 15:38.505
I think it's a little long.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.253
Why don't you get up here,

15:41.323 --> 15:42.948
And I'll pin it.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.575
Your mother needed to risk things.

15:49.642 --> 15:51.977
I admired the recklessness in her.

15:52.043 --> 15:55.905
It was so not me.
I thought it brave.

15:55.979 --> 15:58.313
I couldn't live the way she did.

15:58.378 --> 16:02.153
I'm not the type.
Neither is Ian.

16:02.218 --> 16:03.298
Do you know...

16:03.370 --> 16:05.825
I think we've been faithful
to each other...

16:05.898 --> 16:07.010
for 20 years.

16:07.082 --> 16:08.130
Can you believe that?

16:08.203 --> 16:09.096
Yes.

16:09.162 --> 16:11.137
Most people can't.

17:11.178 --> 17:16.000
Very strange,
that father of hers.

17:16.075 --> 17:18.344
He's never cared about my work.

17:18.410 --> 17:22.185
He hated the portrait
I did of Sarah.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.025
Why does he suddenly
want Lucy to come here?

17:26.089 --> 17:29.865
Maybe it was Lucy
who wanted to come.

17:29.930 --> 17:33.705
Now she's here,
stranded with us old fogies.

17:33.770 --> 17:36.104
Speak for yourself.

17:36.170 --> 17:38.658
I'm sure she'd rather
be out chasing boys...

17:38.730 --> 17:41.381
around on a beach somewhere.

17:41.450 --> 17:43.784
Seemed rather serious to me.

17:43.850 --> 17:47.199
Being chased...
19 is all about boys.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.096
You know, I caught her...

17:49.162 --> 17:51.945
Looking at a picture
of Christopher.

17:52.010 --> 17:53.188
Christopher?

17:53.259 --> 17:56.259
Why not? She's 19.

18:01.610 --> 18:02.984
Not sleepy?

18:03.050 --> 18:04.425
No. Not at all.

18:04.490 --> 18:05.864
Have to finish Daisy's dress.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.556
I must switch off all the lights.

18:07.626 --> 18:09.252
I'll try not to wake you up...

18:09.323 --> 18:10.533
when I get in.

18:10.602 --> 18:11.496
Come here.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.464
Good-Night kiss?

18:17.867 --> 18:19.721
Another one?

18:26.507 --> 18:28.561
You were 19 once, I suppose,

18:28.627 --> 18:30.761
Weren't you?

18:30.826 --> 18:33.160
I suppose I must have been.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.557
Yes?

19:51.626 --> 19:54.496
Excuse me, but you
wouldn't happen to have...

19:54.570 --> 19:58.018
any more of that exotic brand
of cigarette I can smell,

19:58.090 --> 19:59.235
Would you?

20:03.946 --> 20:05.320
Hi.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.297
It's not my best play.

20:28.362 --> 20:30.697
I really liked it.

20:30.762 --> 20:34.242
It's the one
they'll remember me for.

20:37.162 --> 20:38.504
I'm not contagious, you know.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.385
I always smoke this way
with other people.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.360
One doctor even
gave me three months.

20:43.434 --> 20:45.573
One said a week or two, depending.

20:45.642 --> 20:46.853
According to the third,

20:46.923 --> 20:49.028
I should be dead as we speak.

20:49.098 --> 20:50.624
I tend to...

20:50.698 --> 20:53.120
think of the first doctor
as being the wisest.

20:53.194 --> 20:55.681
That's terrible.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.177
You're not one
of those moralistic...

20:59.242 --> 21:00.486
young people, are you?

21:00.554 --> 21:01.929
What do you mean?

21:06.314 --> 21:08.583
I mean sex.

21:11.050 --> 21:12.424
Do you disapprove of sex?

21:12.490 --> 21:13.864
No.

21:15.562 --> 21:18.661
Nothing more transporting,
I seem to remember...

21:21.130 --> 21:23.399
except perhaps good grass.

21:23.466 --> 21:25.855
I wouldn't really know.

21:25.930 --> 21:28.264
I haven't really had it that much.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.704
Grass?

21:29.770 --> 21:30.817
No. Sex.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.580
Hmm?

21:34.090 --> 21:35.977
You mean you never
slept with anybody?

21:36.042 --> 21:37.383
No.

21:37.449 --> 21:39.304
A beautiful girl like you?

21:43.690 --> 21:44.705
Well...

21:45.962 --> 21:47.489
do you remember my mother...

21:47.562 --> 21:50.344
having a pair of green sandals?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.784
Sandals?

21:55.210 --> 21:57.544
I think so.
She could have.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.464
She wore wonderful clothes.

22:01.449 --> 22:03.304
Excuse me.

22:03.370 --> 22:05.639
She was the best-Dressed poet.

22:07.146 --> 22:09.699
Writing transporting little...

22:09.770 --> 22:13.382
verses in between
fashion shoots and...

22:19.146 --> 22:21.088
Why?

22:21.162 --> 22:23.649
Why have you never
wanted to sleep with anyone?

22:23.722 --> 22:25.544
It's not that I...

22:25.610 --> 22:28.676
haven't wanted
to sleep with anyone.

22:28.746 --> 22:30.120
Hmm?

22:31.370 --> 22:33.955
Tell me.

22:34.026 --> 22:37.060
It's not as if I'm going
to know for very long.

22:37.130 --> 22:42.596
There was this one guy
that I really liked.

22:42.666 --> 22:45.961
I met him in the summer
when I was 15.

22:47.466 --> 22:48.415
Mm-Hmm.

22:48.489 --> 22:51.173
He was the first person
I really kissed...

22:51.242 --> 22:54.591
and, um, we wrote
each other for a while.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.837
There was this
one letter about, um,

22:56.906 --> 22:58.248
Him having an animal...

22:58.314 --> 23:00.354
prowling through his heart,

23:00.426 --> 23:02.280
And I memorized the whole thing.

23:02.346 --> 23:05.095
But then after a while,
they just stopped.

23:09.002 --> 23:12.777
And then your mum died,
and everything stopped.

23:12.842 --> 23:14.217
Hmm?

23:14.282 --> 23:15.744
It's not because of my mother.

23:15.818 --> 23:18.055
Her death has nothing
to do with it.

23:18.122 --> 23:20.511
It's easier to stay alone.

23:20.586 --> 23:24.230
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

23:24.298 --> 23:28.095
You can't have decided
that at your age.

23:28.170 --> 23:30.057
I haven't decided.

23:30.122 --> 23:31.977
You're in need of a ravisher.

23:32.042 --> 23:33.351
I'm waiting.

23:37.738 --> 23:40.422
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy...

23:40.490 --> 23:42.148
Would you stop saying that?

23:42.218 --> 23:44.389
You're scared.

23:50.218 --> 23:52.552
What is it you're scared of?

23:54.058 --> 23:56.392
There's something else,
isn't there?

23:56.458 --> 24:00.648
I can see.
You seem to be...

24:00.714 --> 24:03.048
Stoned.

24:03.114 --> 24:04.969
I'm going to bed.

24:06.474 --> 24:09.289
Don't forget this.

24:09.354 --> 24:10.728
Thank you.

24:13.674 --> 24:15.529
Sweet dreams.

24:44.297 --> 24:47.199
Well, look who's up and about.

24:47.274 --> 24:49.063
I had a great night.

24:49.130 --> 24:50.952
You met Lucy.

24:51.017 --> 24:53.439
Oh... she's irresistible.

24:53.514 --> 24:55.172
I'm mad about her.

24:55.242 --> 24:58.919
Now, what's that smile about?

24:58.986 --> 24:59.880
What smile?

24:59.946 --> 25:00.928
Now, come on. Tell.

25:03.530 --> 25:04.424
Mm-Hmm.

25:04.490 --> 25:06.824
Well...

25:06.890 --> 25:09.508
we just... talked.

25:09.578 --> 25:11.433
What did she tell you?

25:11.498 --> 25:12.643
I have a feeling...

25:14.090 --> 25:16.424
not as much as she
might have done.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.781
Oh, come on.

25:19.850 --> 25:22.501
No, no, no.
You can't keep a secret.

25:22.570 --> 25:23.650
Of course I can.

25:23.722 --> 25:24.616
Really?

25:26.570 --> 25:28.425
What's going on?

25:28.490 --> 25:29.952
Nothing's going on.

25:30.025 --> 25:31.367
Noemi, what would you
tell your readers...

25:31.434 --> 25:32.808
about a man
who dangles a secret...

25:32.874 --> 25:33.921
in front of you?

25:33.994 --> 25:35.041
I wasn't dangling it.

25:35.114 --> 25:36.008
Yes, you were.

25:36.074 --> 25:37.187
No, I was not.

25:37.258 --> 25:39.200
He wants to tell it.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.127
We're going to have...

25:49.194 --> 25:50.438
to find Lucy some friends...

25:50.506 --> 25:52.360
so she doesn't get bored
with all us old people.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.800
Are we that old already?

25:53.866 --> 25:54.760
Good morning.

25:54.826 --> 25:55.720
Hi.

25:55.786 --> 25:57.063
Sorry.
My time's all screwed up.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.057
Want some coffee?

25:58.121 --> 25:59.015
Please.

25:59.081 --> 25:59.975
Have some bread.

26:01.001 --> 26:02.911
Do you take milk?

26:02.986 --> 26:05.800
Yeah. Oh, hey!
Uh, no, it's fine.

26:05.866 --> 26:07.240
Um, what time is it there?

26:07.306 --> 26:08.833
Do you take sugar?

26:08.906 --> 26:11.110
What about Filippo Castellini
as Lucy's boyfriend?

26:11.178 --> 26:12.519
Okay, Miranda.

26:12.586 --> 26:13.633
Terrible flirt.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.615
What about Harry Fenimore Jones?

26:15.690 --> 26:17.632
Too perverse
for an American girl.

26:17.706 --> 26:18.786
Would you pass the sugar, Noemi?

26:18.858 --> 26:20.451
Ben Cartaclay.
Cartaclay would love Lucy.

26:20.522 --> 26:21.798
Basta!

26:24.489 --> 26:28.166
Thank you.
I feel like a classified ad.

26:29.738 --> 26:30.687
Do you hear that?

26:30.761 --> 26:33.150
Come and see what
we have to put up with.

26:35.786 --> 26:38.437
All right? Yeah.
Talk to you later. Bye-Bye.

26:45.706 --> 26:46.983
What is that?

26:48.106 --> 26:50.178
They're building a television mast.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.105
To brainwash the Italian electorate.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.315
You don't like it...

26:53.386 --> 26:54.728
because it messes up your view.

27:12.522 --> 27:13.470
Daisy!

27:16.841 --> 27:18.751
My little Piglet.
How was Camilla's?

27:21.098 --> 27:21.991
Again?

27:22.058 --> 27:23.006
Hi, Daisy.

27:23.082 --> 27:24.456
Do you remember Lucy?

27:24.521 --> 27:26.376
You were four
when she was last here.

27:26.441 --> 27:27.335
Hi.

27:27.401 --> 27:28.514
Hmm. What's that?

27:28.586 --> 27:31.652
It's called a scarab.
It's kind of like a beetle.

27:31.722 --> 27:33.249
It's good luck.

27:33.322 --> 27:34.215
Come.

27:37.001 --> 27:38.376
Okay.

27:43.017 --> 27:44.578
Well, thank you for being...

27:44.650 --> 27:46.210
so fucking helpful.

27:46.282 --> 27:47.973
Miranda, you wouldn't stop.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.416
Me! It wasn't just me!

27:49.481 --> 27:53.191
Oh, she's searching
for something...

27:53.258 --> 27:55.746
with those long hands
she can barely control...

27:55.818 --> 27:58.949
and... curiosity.

27:59.018 --> 28:01.833
A little bit frightened.

28:01.898 --> 28:05.193
It reminds me so much
of me somehow.

28:14.857 --> 28:17.094
You know,
I kissed someone here once.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.624
Did he touch tongues?

28:18.698 --> 28:19.591
Uh-Huh.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.763
Miranda likes to kiss boys.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.808
She'll kiss Richard,
and before that,

28:23.882 --> 28:25.704
She kissed Matthew and Johnny...

28:25.769 --> 28:27.460
and Niccolo' and David.

28:27.529 --> 28:29.056
She used to kiss Niccolo'?

28:29.257 --> 28:31.292
Yeah, at the fireworks.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.775
Do you know a man
named Carlo Lisca?

28:44.840 --> 28:46.695
Yes. He lives near Caorle.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.615
Why do you know him?

28:48.680 --> 28:51.014
Mama used to get letters from him.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.375
What's he like?

28:54.440 --> 28:57.255
He's a very good
war correspondent...

28:57.320 --> 28:58.694
but I think...

28:58.760 --> 29:01.094
seeing so much death
and blood and...

29:01.160 --> 29:03.494
horror has made him
a little peculiar.

29:03.559 --> 29:05.894
Well, I'll ask him over.
You can meet him.

29:07.751 --> 29:09.923
Do you remember her
being in love...

29:09.992 --> 29:11.650
with a man here?

29:11.720 --> 29:13.094
You mean Carlo?

29:13.159 --> 29:15.014
I don't know.

29:15.079 --> 29:17.414
There was...

29:17.480 --> 29:19.814
this thing that she wrote about.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.254
Really?

29:21.320 --> 29:22.694
What did she write?

29:22.759 --> 29:25.574
Lucy, I think the time has come.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.294
Off you go.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.495
He's gone to the studio.

29:42.568 --> 29:44.739
You know,
he hasn't worked at night...

29:44.808 --> 29:46.149
for years.

29:46.216 --> 29:48.550
But there's a virgin
in the house.

30:49.992 --> 30:51.967
It's cool in here.

30:53.832 --> 30:56.166
My father never came here.

30:56.231 --> 30:57.409
No.

30:57.479 --> 31:00.349
I never met him.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.878
He's small.
I'm five inches taller.

31:02.951 --> 31:05.253
Really?

31:05.319 --> 31:08.615
Maybe if you could
concentrate on...

31:08.680 --> 31:11.069
on that horse's leg,
for instance.

31:11.143 --> 31:13.445
Might help you to keep still.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.561
Oh, but I see how
you're different...

31:18.632 --> 31:19.580
from your mother.

31:19.655 --> 31:23.233
You have a sort
of joy in your eyes.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.735
H- H-Have you ever
eaten olive leaves?

31:29.800 --> 31:33.061
No.
Olive leaves are inedible.

31:33.127 --> 31:35.942
Disgusting.

31:36.008 --> 31:37.830
Why'd you ask me that?

31:37.895 --> 31:39.302
Just asking.

31:42.663 --> 31:45.478
I can feel the night behind me.

31:45.543 --> 31:47.932
You see why we love it here.

31:48.007 --> 31:51.957
There's one thing I miss, though...

31:53.223 --> 31:54.598
the Grave diggers.

31:55.976 --> 31:58.147
The best pub in Dublin.

32:03.783 --> 32:05.376
I think we've done
enough for tonight.

32:05.447 --> 32:08.676
You've been very patient.

32:10.984 --> 32:12.358
Good night.

32:30.663 --> 32:32.997
I love to fuck Pumpkin.

32:33.064 --> 32:36.195
Oh, I love to fuck
my little Pumpkin.

32:40.679 --> 32:42.534
I love to fuck Pumpkin.

32:42.599 --> 32:44.454
I love to fuck
my little Pumpkin.

32:44.519 --> 32:45.894
Oh, I'm fucking Pumpkin.

32:45.959 --> 32:48.293
Oh, Poop is fucking Pumpkin.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.974
I'm your daddy, baby.

32:52.039 --> 32:53.949
That's good, baby.

32:54.024 --> 32:56.358
Oh, yeah!
You like it, baby?

32:56.423 --> 32:57.317
Yes!

32:57.383 --> 32:58.365
Tell me you like it. Oh!

32:58.439 --> 33:00.894
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

33:00.967 --> 33:03.650
No! No! No! No! No! No!
Yes! No! No!

33:05.159 --> 33:06.304
No! Shh! Shh!

33:12.359 --> 33:13.407
Where does he go?

33:13.480 --> 33:15.651
Shh! Don't wake him.

33:15.719 --> 33:18.534
You must never
disturb sleepwalkers.

33:48.295 --> 33:49.572
Ha ha ha!

33:54.535 --> 33:57.350
Here comes the Marquis de Saab.

34:03.591 --> 34:05.566
Noemi. Michele.

34:09.735 --> 34:10.661
Carlo!

34:15.655 --> 34:17.924
Carlo Lisca, Monsieur Guillaume.

34:24.775 --> 34:26.150
Come on and play! Come on!

34:27.463 --> 34:29.023
Is that Sarah's daughter?

34:29.094 --> 34:30.949
Mmm. Lucy.

34:31.014 --> 34:32.389
Aah!

34:41.255 --> 34:42.181
Richard, sweetheart,

34:42.246 --> 34:43.906
We're going to go have a swim.

34:43.976 --> 34:45.350
All right.
Just a second, babe.

34:45.415 --> 34:46.692
Hey!
You get back here!

34:54.759 --> 34:56.799
Whoo-Hoo! Ya-Hoo!

34:59.271 --> 35:00.766
Ha ha ha!

35:01.831 --> 35:04.700
You get back here, young lady!

35:04.775 --> 35:05.920
Aah!

35:08.007 --> 35:09.381
I'm right here.

35:09.448 --> 35:11.782
Richard, are you coming or not?

35:11.847 --> 35:13.603
Stop it!

35:42.887 --> 35:44.262
You Carlo?

35:44.327 --> 35:45.854
Yes.

35:45.928 --> 35:49.637
My mother used to mark
a star on her calendar...

35:49.703 --> 35:51.907
every time she got
a letter from you.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.950
I was very fond of your mother.

35:54.023 --> 35:55.877
We had many jokes together.

35:55.943 --> 35:58.758
She appeared the delicate woman,

35:58.823 --> 36:02.784
But she loved to act vulgar.

36:02.855 --> 36:04.415
That's not what I remember.

36:04.487 --> 36:05.534
I remember her...

36:05.607 --> 36:07.778
sitting awake all night
in the dark...

36:07.847 --> 36:08.895
smoking cigarettes...

36:08.968 --> 36:11.717
and listening to jazz records.

36:11.783 --> 36:13.638
Everyone has dark moods.

36:13.703 --> 36:15.078
Do you?

36:15.143 --> 36:17.958
Only when I am away from war.

36:18.023 --> 36:21.798
Around war,
I am as light as a souffle.

36:21.863 --> 36:23.651
You ever killed a viper?

36:23.720 --> 36:26.883
Of course.
I grew up in the country.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.123
Did you ever meet my father?

36:29.191 --> 36:31.046
It's not what you think.

36:31.111 --> 36:33.445
We had only one night together.

36:33.511 --> 36:35.169
That's all.

36:35.239 --> 36:36.614
Only one night?

36:36.679 --> 36:38.719
We were friends.

36:38.791 --> 36:39.806
Lucy?

36:43.143 --> 36:44.998
See you later.

36:46.919 --> 36:50.050
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

36:50.119 --> 36:52.453
I don't think he's the one.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.894
Not for you.

36:53.959 --> 36:57.734
Not for my Lucy in the sky.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.173
Actually, I like him.

37:00.679 --> 37:03.494
You do?

37:03.559 --> 37:05.893
There's something
familiar about him.

37:13.639 --> 37:15.494
My illusion's shattered.

37:23.239 --> 37:25.094
Come.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.909
Let us bring up the rear...

37:27.975 --> 37:30.310
Like Turgenev's poor Rakitin.

37:38.055 --> 37:40.356
Oh, look.

37:45.255 --> 37:46.149
Oh, God.

37:46.215 --> 37:47.425
What?

37:50.055 --> 37:52.870
I can't bear it. It's too unnatural.

37:52.935 --> 37:53.829
Come on.

37:53.895 --> 37:55.750
They're not going to bite you.

38:00.551 --> 38:03.747
Can you imagine Sarah
being a virgin at 19?

38:35.559 --> 38:37.020
What about Christopher
as your boyfriend?

38:37.095 --> 38:38.721
Who told you that?

38:38.791 --> 38:40.700
That's what Mommy told Noemi.

38:47.303 --> 38:48.318
Oh, hello.

38:48.391 --> 38:49.503
Christopher!

38:49.575 --> 38:50.469
Crazy Daisy.

38:50.535 --> 38:51.484
Piglet.

38:51.559 --> 38:52.868
Piglet.

38:52.935 --> 38:54.211
Hey!

38:55.591 --> 38:58.144
Here. The Turkish flag.

38:58.215 --> 38:59.644
I remember you. Lucy.

38:59.719 --> 39:00.613
Hi.

39:00.679 --> 39:01.923
Sorry. Did I interrupt you?

39:01.991 --> 39:03.714
This is the last time
I carry your bag.

39:05.671 --> 39:06.881
Hello.

39:06.951 --> 39:08.293
Don't tell me
you've forgotten Lucy.

39:08.359 --> 39:09.668
Lucy harmon.

39:09.735 --> 39:11.262
Lucy?

39:11.335 --> 39:13.669
Lucy.

39:13.735 --> 39:15.426
Of course, it's you.

39:17.319 --> 39:18.813
Osvaldo.

39:20.295 --> 39:22.532
Yes. I remember her.

39:22.599 --> 39:24.093
Come to dinner tonight.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.261
I'll get Mum to call.

39:28.327 --> 39:29.221
Good.

39:31.111 --> 39:33.599
So I'll see you very, very soon.

40:40.807 --> 40:42.181
Dinnertime.

40:44.167 --> 40:46.501
Do you think she's
still angry with me?

40:50.407 --> 40:52.741
Darling, I don't think
she's giving you...

40:52.807 --> 40:54.181
too much thought.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.621
Come on.

41:55.751 --> 41:57.474
Ah, Chiarella.

41:57.543 --> 42:00.358
Buonasera.

42:17.127 --> 42:19.974
Chiarella Donati, Monsieur Guillaume.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.467
Buonasera.

42:22.918 --> 42:24.729
But where is Lucy?

42:24.856 --> 42:28.337
So, Lucy harmon,
how long are you staying,

42:28.409 --> 42:30.263
And what do you think of Italy,

42:30.329 --> 42:32.184
And when are you going
to come to our house...

42:32.249 --> 42:33.623
and see how real Italians live...

42:33.689 --> 42:35.544
and change your life forever?

42:35.609 --> 42:37.649
You didn't even recognize me.

42:52.440 --> 42:53.967
Excuse me.

43:09.209 --> 43:12.854
I decided I had
to get rid of it one summer...

43:12.921 --> 43:14.776
before I went back to school.

43:14.841 --> 43:15.888
Darling,

43:15.961 --> 43:18.132
Are you speaking of life before me?

43:18.201 --> 43:20.056
I ended up doing it
with the same guy...

43:20.121 --> 43:21.496
my best friend did it with.

43:21.561 --> 43:23.895
He was the local... deflowerer.

43:23.961 --> 43:25.816
Hmm.

43:25.881 --> 43:28.215
God. Please. Ow! Fuck!

43:28.281 --> 43:29.655
Jesus!

43:29.721 --> 43:33.977
Aw, shit on a stick.

43:34.041 --> 43:37.336
Well, that's what pot's all about.

43:37.401 --> 43:38.775
There you go.

43:40.281 --> 43:43.216
I wonder how
we got on this subject.

43:43.289 --> 43:44.849
And there were girls...

43:44.921 --> 43:46.448
queuing up around the block...

43:46.521 --> 43:47.895
to see this guy.

43:47.961 --> 43:50.296
We had 10 minutes with him.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.216
Exactly 10.
No more, no less.

43:52.281 --> 43:53.775
God, Miranda.

43:53.849 --> 43:55.572
I remember that guy.

43:55.641 --> 43:58.937
Oh, he was repulsive.

43:59.001 --> 44:01.335
He was creepy, I must admit.

44:01.401 --> 44:03.256
I don't remember mine at all.

44:03.321 --> 44:05.231
I was completely drunk.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.632
It was in a car.

44:16.697 --> 44:19.512
It was snowing.

44:19.577 --> 44:21.911
I was 11...

44:21.977 --> 44:23.984
tripping with my baby-Sitter.

44:28.184 --> 44:29.875
Lucy?

44:29.945 --> 44:32.498
What about falling in love?

44:32.569 --> 44:35.864
None of you even mentioned
falling in love.

44:42.169 --> 44:43.543
There's not love.

44:43.608 --> 44:46.064
There's only proof of love.

44:46.136 --> 44:48.820
And what about you, Osvaldo?

44:48.889 --> 44:51.704
I don't know which
is more ridiculous...

44:51.769 --> 44:54.551
This conversation or
the silly political one...

44:54.616 --> 44:56.177
going on over there.

44:56.249 --> 44:58.420
What about you?

44:58.489 --> 45:00.344
Oh, no, not me.

45:00.409 --> 45:02.264
Not you, what?

45:02.329 --> 45:04.184
Love.

45:04.249 --> 45:07.064
That's not a word that I use.

45:08.985 --> 45:12.760
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

45:12.825 --> 45:17.080
I think I miss a lot
of trouble that way.

45:17.144 --> 45:19.927
I think I've missed a lot of you.

45:28.185 --> 45:29.330
Oh, my God.

45:36.825 --> 45:38.199
I'm sorry.

45:38.264 --> 45:40.686
That's okay. That's okay.

45:44.024 --> 45:46.959
You've been too far away.

46:58.841 --> 46:59.735
Yeah?

46:59.801 --> 47:01.230
Yeah.

47:03.577 --> 47:04.559
Hey, Lu.

47:06.937 --> 47:09.752
I was just wondering
if maybe, uh...

47:09.817 --> 47:12.632
I could, um, bum a smoke.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.552
I thought you hated smoking.

47:14.617 --> 47:16.951
Ah, yes, well,
don't tell Miranda.

47:17.016 --> 47:18.391
Jesus.

47:18.457 --> 47:21.239
Have to quit someday, I guess.

47:21.304 --> 47:23.671
I have never been down here.

47:23.737 --> 47:25.591
Huh.

47:25.657 --> 47:27.991
Oh, so this is, like...

47:28.057 --> 47:29.431
the view.

47:29.497 --> 47:30.871
I get it.

47:30.937 --> 47:32.311
Ha ha ha.

47:32.376 --> 47:34.711
I have a loft in New York.

47:34.777 --> 47:36.151
Although, I must say,

47:36.217 --> 47:38.584
The bathroom wasn't
completely exposed...

47:38.649 --> 47:40.950
to the entire room.

47:41.017 --> 47:43.504
Ah, what have we here?

47:44.984 --> 47:46.707
You do write, huh?

47:46.776 --> 47:47.922
Sorry.

47:50.137 --> 47:52.471
What do you write about?

47:52.537 --> 47:53.911
Your fantasies?

47:56.376 --> 47:59.279
I mean, you do have
fantasies, right?

47:59.352 --> 48:00.629
Everybody does.

48:00.697 --> 48:02.519
You know,
there's this exercise...

48:02.584 --> 48:03.664
that actors do...

48:03.736 --> 48:04.947
to explore their fantasies...

48:05.016 --> 48:07.351
and to shed their inhibitions.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.206
Have you ever tried that?

48:09.273 --> 48:10.702
Giving up control?

48:10.777 --> 48:11.987
Like what?

48:12.057 --> 48:15.439
Like, get on your knees.

48:15.512 --> 48:17.422
Ha ha ha!

48:17.496 --> 48:19.504
Right. On my knees.

48:19.577 --> 48:21.104
I'll show you.

48:21.176 --> 48:23.184
Okay.

48:23.257 --> 48:24.598
You go first.

48:26.617 --> 48:27.544
Okay.

48:41.977 --> 48:42.935
Now...

48:43.204 --> 48:44.865
on all fours.

48:44.936 --> 48:46.230
You're kidding...

48:46.296 --> 48:47.671
No talking.

48:52.056 --> 48:53.431
Now...

48:53.497 --> 48:56.312
go to the mirror.

48:56.377 --> 48:57.970
Slowly.

49:06.873 --> 49:08.247
Open your mouth.

49:11.192 --> 49:12.403
Tongue out.

49:15.704 --> 49:17.231
And lick.

49:26.073 --> 49:28.113
Good.

49:28.184 --> 49:29.875
And lick.

49:36.152 --> 49:37.941
Good kitty.

49:38.969 --> 49:39.863
Rrr.

49:39.929 --> 49:41.838
Rrr.

49:41.912 --> 49:42.840
Lick.

49:47.672 --> 49:50.968
Now, touch your tongue
to my tongue...

49:51.032 --> 49:52.658
for the ultimate connection.

49:53.913 --> 49:56.182
Um, Lucy, I was just wondering...

49:56.249 --> 49:57.143
Oh, Richard.

49:57.209 --> 49:58.103
Hi, sweetie.

49:58.169 --> 49:59.543
Wh-What's going on?

49:59.608 --> 50:01.463
Uh, well, we were just, uh...

50:01.528 --> 50:02.422
you know.

50:02.488 --> 50:03.382
Wait. Wait.

50:03.448 --> 50:05.303
Miranda!

50:05.368 --> 50:06.743
Quite frankly,

50:06.809 --> 50:08.532
I don't know why
you even bothered coming.

50:08.600 --> 50:10.193
Either you're jogging
your ass off somewhere,

50:10.264 --> 50:12.474
Or you've got your ear glued
to that bloody phone.

50:12.561 --> 50:14.705
Plus, you reek of aftershave.
What were you two doing in there?

50:14.744 --> 50:15.638
Nothing.

50:15.704 --> 50:16.751
Nothing?
For Christ's sake!

50:16.824 --> 50:18.647
You're in there sniffing
around her like a dog!

50:18.712 --> 50:19.661
I was explaining...

50:19.737 --> 50:22.257
the Lee Strasberg
acting technique.

50:24.089 --> 50:25.463
No. I'm sorry.

50:25.528 --> 50:26.422
What?

50:58.104 --> 50:59.511
Niccolo'?

51:28.345 --> 51:29.806
No, um...

51:34.808 --> 51:35.954
Grazie.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.378
Ciao, Lucy!

52:47.192 --> 52:48.850
Ow, shit!

52:54.616 --> 52:55.990
Did you hurt yourself?

52:56.056 --> 52:56.950
No.

52:57.016 --> 52:58.231
Are you sure?

52:58.296 --> 52:59.351
Yes!

53:38.776 --> 53:39.856
Well...

53:39.929 --> 53:41.783
they'll come and pick me up...

53:41.849 --> 53:43.507
tomorrow morning at dawn.

53:43.576 --> 53:44.950
Well, thank you, anyway.

53:45.016 --> 53:46.031
No!

53:46.104 --> 53:47.314
You can't just go...

53:47.384 --> 53:49.207
and sit at the bottom
of the drive.

53:49.272 --> 53:50.647
Would you like a cup of tea?

53:50.712 --> 53:52.086
Are you in the highway patrol?

53:52.153 --> 53:53.135
No. In the army.

53:53.209 --> 53:54.550
You must try some of our honey.

53:54.616 --> 53:55.696
It's from our own bees.

53:55.768 --> 53:56.881
What's your rank?

53:56.953 --> 53:58.807
Lieutenant.

54:05.912 --> 54:06.959
Here. Have a biscuit.

54:07.032 --> 54:08.407
Well, thank you.

54:36.569 --> 54:38.129
Don't be cross with me.

54:40.632 --> 54:42.126
I'm sorry.

54:43.928 --> 54:46.165
Please forgive me.

54:48.824 --> 54:51.377
We're all going
to a pizzeria for dinner,

54:51.448 --> 54:52.975
If you want to come.

54:53.048 --> 54:54.225
Yeah?

54:54.296 --> 54:56.336
I think I'll pass on that.

54:56.408 --> 54:57.782
What have you done?

54:57.848 --> 54:58.960
It's just a scratch.

54:59.032 --> 55:00.177
That's terrible.

55:00.248 --> 55:03.063
No, wait.
I'll do something about it.

55:03.128 --> 55:05.943
I've got stuff
that's going to do that.

55:06.008 --> 55:07.863
I'm going to clean it up.

55:13.208 --> 55:14.582
Here, put it on my knee.

55:14.648 --> 55:15.542
Come on.

55:21.368 --> 55:23.703
Oh, we have to clean that up.

55:25.688 --> 55:27.543
Alcohol?

55:27.608 --> 55:29.942
You know...

55:30.008 --> 55:31.863
you must not let it get to you.

55:31.928 --> 55:33.073
What?

55:33.144 --> 55:34.257
Us.

55:37.688 --> 55:39.630
We don't mean you any harm.

55:39.704 --> 55:41.395
Gentle.

55:41.464 --> 55:43.919
It's just that up on this hill,

55:43.992 --> 55:46.447
The only thing
we have to talk about...

55:46.520 --> 55:47.535
is each other.

55:47.609 --> 55:49.463
Blow on it, please.

55:53.528 --> 55:55.797
You don't know how much good...

55:55.864 --> 55:57.719
your being here has done me.

55:57.784 --> 55:59.639
Better than all the drugs.

56:02.105 --> 56:04.919
You're my own
personal walking I.V.

56:06.424 --> 56:08.279
Do you know French?

56:08.344 --> 56:10.929
Comme ci comme ca.

56:15.544 --> 56:18.359
You have to allow me
a little frivolity.

56:33.860 --> 56:35.387
English, please.

56:35.460 --> 56:37.314
I'm here for work.

56:37.380 --> 56:38.754
Unfortunately,

56:38.820 --> 56:40.675
Not something
I'm permitted to discuss.

56:40.740 --> 56:42.115
Oh, top secret.

56:42.180 --> 56:45.562
Oh, top secret?

56:48.420 --> 56:50.755
Hey! Look!

56:50.820 --> 56:51.714
Ciao!

56:51.780 --> 56:53.307
Oh... hey.

56:57.860 --> 56:59.616
This is Gabriella.

56:59.684 --> 57:02.237
Sit down with us here.

57:11.396 --> 57:13.436
Lieutenant, have some bruschetta.

57:13.508 --> 57:15.842
No, thanks.
Garlic gives me gas.

57:15.908 --> 57:17.981
Oh!

57:18.052 --> 57:21.597
Get the shit off the table.

57:21.668 --> 57:23.523
Here we go.

57:25.508 --> 57:28.225
I can't piss in that shit pile.

57:28.292 --> 57:30.659
Did I say something wrong?

57:30.724 --> 57:33.058
No, no. He's a very
well-Known art dealer.

57:33.124 --> 57:34.498
He's legendary,

57:34.564 --> 57:36.800
But sometimes he has
these little episodes.

57:38.468 --> 57:40.606
Mr. Guillaume is very theatrical.

57:41.924 --> 57:43.200
Up we go.

57:46.692 --> 57:49.561
The angels talking again, Mr. G.?

57:49.636 --> 57:52.124
I think it's time
we took the angels home to bed.

57:57.543 --> 57:59.069
Oh, Gui.

57:59.142 --> 58:00.517
Perhaps I could help?

58:00.583 --> 58:02.753
I think we can manage.
Thanks.

58:02.822 --> 58:05.156
Ah, mon ami, I'm sorry.

58:05.222 --> 58:07.904
I haven't a car for you.

58:23.971 --> 58:24.865
Good night.

58:24.931 --> 58:26.687
Good night.

58:26.754 --> 58:28.128
Good night.

58:28.193 --> 58:29.142
Bye, Mummy.

58:29.218 --> 58:30.298
Bye.

58:35.233 --> 58:36.280
Ciao.

59:22.330 --> 59:23.705
Lucy, want to play?

59:23.770 --> 59:25.296
Daisy, Lucy is helping Daddy...

59:25.370 --> 59:26.711
with his work.

59:34.361 --> 59:36.215
Miranda, want to come and play?

59:36.281 --> 59:38.483
No. I'm not in the mood
for playing with Piglets.

59:43.960 --> 59:46.293
Richard, want to come play?

59:46.358 --> 59:48.692
Richard! Come w...

59:49.719 --> 59:51.093
Ow!

01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:04.333
Uh!!!

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.704
Oops!

01:00:58.764 --> 01:01:00.619
Oh! Oh!

01:01:04.042 --> 01:01:04.936
Take that!

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.337
And that!

01:01:07.403 --> 01:01:08.777
And that!

01:01:08.842 --> 01:01:10.216
And that!

01:01:10.282 --> 01:01:11.656
And that!

01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:13.096
And that!

01:01:45.733 --> 01:01:48.033
Oh, if I'm not ready now,

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.310
I'll never be ready.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.940
You're free.

01:02:20.224 --> 01:02:21.597
Ciao!

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:53.207
So when did Gabriella leave?

01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:55.892
This morning.
I asked her to.

01:02:55.962 --> 01:02:57.872
Why?

01:02:57.946 --> 01:03:01.426
I wanted to see you.

01:03:03.225 --> 01:03:04.785
Lucy.

01:03:06.296 --> 01:03:08.151
So this is an olive grove?

01:03:08.216 --> 01:03:10.071
Yes.

01:03:16.311 --> 01:03:18.580
You looked very beautiful...

01:03:18.647 --> 01:03:21.035
back there.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.925
I could not take my eyes away.

01:03:29.749 --> 01:03:31.604
Like this.

01:03:50.387 --> 01:03:52.720
I need to kiss your mouth.

01:04:02.865 --> 01:04:05.198
After this long time.

01:04:52.232 --> 01:04:54.087
Wait.

01:04:57.031 --> 01:04:58.406
Please.

01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:01.766
Lucy...

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.718
I'm dying for you.

01:05:08.967 --> 01:05:10.821
I'm dying.

01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:18.500
Not here.

01:05:18.565 --> 01:05:19.775
I can't.

01:05:19.845 --> 01:05:22.910
I can't! No!

01:05:24.164 --> 01:05:27.066
Stop, please. Stop. No!

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.699
Stop!

01:05:30.307 --> 01:05:32.096
What is it?

01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:13.324
What's the matter?

01:07:13.395 --> 01:07:14.824
This was my mother's...

01:07:14.899 --> 01:07:16.787
from right before she died.

01:07:18.483 --> 01:07:20.337
It's about me.

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:29.359
"Where have they gone,
the green sandals?

01:07:29.426 --> 01:07:31.846
I was not made to be a mother.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.255
I had too stricken a heart,

01:07:34.321 --> 01:07:36.971
So I wore green sandals
to stay apart.

01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:40.814
Then one night,
a man stood in an olive grove.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.847
He beat a viper till it bled,

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.774
Then drew me down low.

01:07:45.839 --> 01:07:48.654
One night was all there was.

01:07:48.719 --> 01:07:51.784
He fed me an olive leaf.

01:07:51.854 --> 01:07:55.367
And broke the...

01:07:57.389 --> 01:08:00.105
the strap of my dress.

01:08:08.332 --> 01:08:10.187
Come here.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:19.304
"I kept...

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.703
I kept on the green sandals,

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:25.064
But I could not get off that hill.

01:08:25.129 --> 01:08:30.343
Italy, where did you take me
that night so black...

01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:32.263
and still?

01:08:32.328 --> 01:08:35.143
He had an accent and a knife,

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:38.022
And somewhere, even, had a wife.

01:08:38.087 --> 01:08:41.470
He took my face and tore my hips...

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:44.924
and planted in their place
something new and strange...

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:47.136
and near to love.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:50.979
I thought I had nothing left,
but you came later,

01:08:51.045 --> 01:08:52.899
Curved anew.

01:08:52.965 --> 01:08:54.819
Forgive me.

01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:57.634
I did not have
the means for catching...

01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:00.996
when I got poor Lucy."

01:09:02.979 --> 01:09:04.834
You.

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:07.233
It's my real father.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.633
So it would seem.

01:09:11.139 --> 01:09:12.993
It's not you, is it?

01:09:16.898 --> 01:09:19.232
Can you picture me beating a viper?

01:09:19.296 --> 01:09:22.112
I don't even know
what a viper looks like.

01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:26.912
I thought it was Carlo Lisca.

01:09:26.975 --> 01:09:28.404
Really?

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:31.229
But I'm not sure anymore.

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:34.749
Just forget about it.

01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:36.986
I already have a father I love.

01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:38.910
No, no, no.

01:09:40.895 --> 01:09:43.676
I was never very good at...

01:09:43.741 --> 01:09:46.555
asking for the things
that I needed.

01:09:47.773 --> 01:09:49.943
Have you ever been in love?

01:09:52.412 --> 01:09:54.268
Lots of times.

01:09:57.148 --> 01:09:58.522
No.

01:10:00.988 --> 01:10:02.841
Just once.

01:10:08.025 --> 01:10:09.552
Alex.

01:10:10.586 --> 01:10:12.920
Alex, are you okay?

01:10:14.873 --> 01:10:15.887
Hmm. I'm sorry.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.815
I feel a bit grotty today.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.309
Here.
Can I get you something?

01:10:19.385 --> 01:10:21.751
I'll be all right.
Don't fuss.

01:10:21.815 --> 01:10:24.914
I'm just feeling a bit...

01:10:24.984 --> 01:10:26.839
rough.

01:10:26.904 --> 01:10:28.244
That's all.

01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:36.437
Don't give up.

01:10:36.502 --> 01:10:38.357
You'll find him.

01:10:40.341 --> 01:10:42.829
You won't disappoint me.

01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:02.988
Well, don't you look nice.

01:11:04.332 --> 01:11:05.576
Can I see?

01:11:05.644 --> 01:11:08.010
No! I mean...

01:11:08.075 --> 01:11:10.923
I never let anybody look
until it's finished.

01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:12.613
Does it look like me?

01:11:13.739 --> 01:11:15.494
It's not supposed to.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:16.456
It's not?

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:17.570
Of course not.

01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:18.887
Didn't anybody ever tell you...

01:11:18.954 --> 01:11:20.066
that the true artist...

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:22.527
only ever depicts himself?

01:11:22.602 --> 01:11:24.129
Thanks a lot.

01:11:24.202 --> 01:11:26.023
You sure you won't come?

01:11:26.089 --> 01:11:29.384
It's been the same
for the last 20 years.

01:11:29.449 --> 01:11:31.172
Why should tonight be different?

01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:35.037
I thought life with you
was going to be one long party.

01:11:35.112 --> 01:11:36.966
Not so.

01:11:37.032 --> 01:11:38.885
Bella.

01:11:50.822 --> 01:11:53.952
This reminds me of dances
I used to go to...

01:11:54.021 --> 01:11:55.614
when I was a girl.

01:11:55.685 --> 01:11:58.018
Silly, isn't it,
to feel homesick...

01:11:58.084 --> 01:11:59.938
in a magic place like this?

01:12:00.004 --> 01:12:01.858
Beauty wounds the heart.

01:12:03.364 --> 01:12:04.541
I can't believe...

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:06.171
you actually brought that thing.

01:12:06.243 --> 01:12:07.356
You know,

01:12:07.427 --> 01:12:09.052
Something surprising
always happens...

01:12:09.123 --> 01:12:10.977
every year at this party.

01:12:11.042 --> 01:12:12.897
You'll see.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.806
Come on. Just a little more.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:47.797
Carlo.

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.627
It's Christopher!

01:14:15.695 --> 01:14:17.605
Yeah.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.305
Bearing a torch.

01:14:20.975 --> 01:14:22.349
Oh!

01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:23.789
Hello.

01:14:23.855 --> 01:14:24.749
Hi, Christopher.

01:14:24.815 --> 01:14:27.465
Is this what you want in life?

01:14:27.534 --> 01:14:28.744
I didn't realize...

01:14:28.814 --> 01:14:30.024
he was a, uh...

01:14:30.093 --> 01:14:31.468
he was what?

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:32.428
Uh...

01:14:32.494 --> 01:14:33.388
Oh, Lucy.

01:14:33.454 --> 01:14:35.308
Darling, would you hold that?

01:14:35.373 --> 01:14:36.747
Uh, sure. Fine.

01:14:36.812 --> 01:14:38.187
Can I do you a favor?

01:14:38.253 --> 01:14:39.147
What?

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:41.067
Wait. See.
It looks like a spaceship.

01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:42.921
See?
It looks so much better.

01:14:42.988 --> 01:14:44.362
You look beautiful.

01:14:44.428 --> 01:14:46.598
Thank you.

01:14:49.707 --> 01:14:51.747
Carlo.

01:14:51.818 --> 01:14:53.344
Would you like to dance?

01:14:53.418 --> 01:14:54.792
Now?

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.352
Now.

01:15:25.286 --> 01:15:27.619
Do you happen to remember...

01:15:27.685 --> 01:15:30.783
where you were in August 1975?

01:15:30.853 --> 01:15:32.227
I try to forget...

01:15:32.292 --> 01:15:37.213
but that was after
the fall of Saigon.

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:39.868
Hard to forget
the fall of Saigon.

01:15:39.939 --> 01:15:43.584
But after, did you
come back to Italy?

01:15:43.651 --> 01:15:47.228
I don't think
I ever came back.

01:16:41.275 --> 01:16:42.649
What?

01:16:42.714 --> 01:16:46.008
I will show you what
this bastard likes.

01:16:58.519 --> 01:17:00.046
Marta.

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.309
Ha ha ha!

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.149
Oh!

01:17:59.215 --> 01:18:01.548
Ha ha! Oh!

01:19:00.581 --> 01:19:02.915
You look as if
you've lost something.

01:19:02.981 --> 01:19:04.836
I haven't lost anything.

01:19:04.901 --> 01:19:08.097
Huh. Well, perhaps
I can help you find it.

01:19:13.859 --> 01:19:15.386
Do you have a cigarette?

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.834
Um...

01:19:16.899 --> 01:19:18.273
cigar do?

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.892
Oh, please.

01:19:20.962 --> 01:19:23.068
Mmm. Huh.

01:19:23.138 --> 01:19:25.528
What do I...

01:19:25.601 --> 01:19:26.649
Yeah, that's it.

01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:28.031
Hey.

01:19:28.098 --> 01:19:29.342
Ew!

01:19:32.993 --> 01:19:33.887
Come.

01:19:33.953 --> 01:19:35.479
Home.

01:19:47.551 --> 01:19:49.722
Do you ever get the feeling...

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.317
you're being watched?

01:19:51.391 --> 01:19:53.245
Mm-Hmm.

01:20:24.025 --> 01:20:26.840
Wait.
I want to ask you something.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:27.734
Yeah?

01:20:27.801 --> 01:20:29.175
I'm coming to America,

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.094
And I want to ask you about it.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.534
Okay, maybe later...

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.974
Good night, Lucy.

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:35.414
Good night. We could...

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.374
When?

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.333
Tomorrow?

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:39.733
Okay.
I'll come over tomorrow.

01:20:39.799 --> 01:20:42.133
Are you sure he can drive?

01:20:42.199 --> 01:20:43.572
Of course I can drive.

01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:45.012
Come on.

01:20:54.196 --> 01:20:56.051
Thanks for the party!

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:13.808
Shh.

01:21:13.874 --> 01:21:15.946
Hug me.

01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:22.440
No kiss.

01:21:22.512 --> 01:21:24.781
Let's go.

01:21:28.688 --> 01:21:30.062
Absolutely no kissing...

01:21:30.127 --> 01:21:34.382
because... I am, above all,
an Englishman...

01:21:34.447 --> 01:21:36.618
and a gentleman.

01:21:49.324 --> 01:21:51.179
Grab my ass.

01:21:53.164 --> 01:21:54.571
Mmm.

01:21:54.636 --> 01:21:56.009
Hey, baby. Come here.

01:21:56.075 --> 01:21:58.376
You got to see this.

01:22:01.354 --> 01:22:02.696
No kissing.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:05.544
Oh!

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:07.017
Look at her!
Look at that!

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:08.129
Richard!

01:22:08.201 --> 01:22:11.845
What?
I like it when you're mad.

01:22:11.913 --> 01:22:14.301
Right over here.

01:22:14.376 --> 01:22:15.750
Get on that bed!

01:22:15.817 --> 01:22:18.816
Right back on the bed.
Right back on the bed.

01:22:26.951 --> 01:22:28.063
I know how it looks.

01:22:28.134 --> 01:22:31.134
They're wonderful,
wonderful friends.

01:22:31.206 --> 01:22:32.221
They just...

01:22:32.294 --> 01:22:35.675
They just have this
habit of disappearing,

01:22:35.749 --> 01:22:37.691
Which means, as usual,

01:22:37.765 --> 01:22:40.546
I've been completely abandoned.

01:22:40.613 --> 01:22:41.987
I'll be right back.

01:22:42.052 --> 01:22:44.059
Right. Good.

01:22:58.851 --> 01:23:00.475
Come in.

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:05.024
Hi!

01:23:05.089 --> 01:23:06.943
Hi.

01:23:12.064 --> 01:23:14.136
So I brought someone back.

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:16.215
Yeah. I heard.

01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:18.939
Who's the lucky fella?

01:23:19.008 --> 01:23:20.795
Huh. Guy from the party.

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.237
Uh-Huh.

01:23:22.303 --> 01:23:23.961
Italian?

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.102
English, actually.

01:23:26.174 --> 01:23:28.443
Oh, English.

01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:31.805
So... good.

01:23:31.869 --> 01:23:34.738
Well, I'm...
proud to be nearby...

01:23:34.813 --> 01:23:37.911
at such an auspicious moment.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.190
What are you doing?

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.470
Oh, I've lost something.

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.427
I think it might have been...

01:23:42.492 --> 01:23:44.314
one of the better things
I've written,

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.459
But, of course,

01:23:45.531 --> 01:23:48.466
I would think that
since I can't find it.

01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:54.803
Go on. Off you go.

01:23:54.874 --> 01:23:57.241
Okay.

01:23:57.306 --> 01:23:58.799
Night.

01:23:58.873 --> 01:24:00.280
Good night.

01:24:04.409 --> 01:24:06.033
Off you go.

01:24:06.104 --> 01:24:07.478
What?

01:24:07.544 --> 01:24:09.070
Nothing.

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:34.642
Hello.

01:24:34.708 --> 01:24:36.912
Where are we?

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:38.539
Nowhere.

01:24:38.611 --> 01:24:39.953
What are you doing?

01:24:40.019 --> 01:24:41.841
Going to sleep.

01:24:41.907 --> 01:24:43.881
No. Of course not.

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:47.598
I will absolutely sleep there.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.040
Oh...

01:24:49.106 --> 01:24:50.479
spinning head.

01:24:52.445 --> 01:24:53.512
It's okay.

01:24:55.241 --> 01:24:59.997
No. No.
I absolutely insist.

01:25:55.103 --> 01:25:57.972
Uh! Ahh.

01:25:58.047 --> 01:26:00.251
Uh! Ahh.

01:26:02.749 --> 01:26:04.921
Ah!

01:26:28.378 --> 01:26:29.490
Huh.

01:26:29.562 --> 01:26:30.609
Shh.

01:26:35.801 --> 01:26:37.656
Shh.

01:26:50.679 --> 01:26:52.054
Come on.

01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:58.157
I don't know...

01:26:58.230 --> 01:26:59.659
what you're complaining
about, you know?

01:26:59.735 --> 01:27:00.977
You've been getting
what you want,

01:27:01.046 --> 01:27:01.994
When you want it.

01:27:02.069 --> 01:27:04.240
So I'm supposed to be grateful?

01:27:04.309 --> 01:27:07.472
I can already picture your
next summer on Nantucket...

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.198
with some WASP heiress.

01:27:09.268 --> 01:27:12.617
Excuse me.
Have I misled you in some way?

01:27:12.692 --> 01:27:13.804
Whatever happened to...

01:27:13.876 --> 01:27:16.396
"What you see
is what you get," huh?

01:27:16.467 --> 01:27:18.474
Oh, come on.

01:27:18.547 --> 01:27:22.954
This isn't you.
I know you.

01:27:23.026 --> 01:27:25.579
Tell that to your wife.

01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:30.123
Tell your wife
how well you know me.

01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:32.783
All right.

01:27:41.712 --> 01:27:43.784
I'm going to call Dr. Signorelli.

01:27:43.855 --> 01:27:46.058
Oh, God, no.

01:27:46.126 --> 01:27:49.574
He smells like rotten meat.

01:27:49.647 --> 01:27:51.915
Mmm.

01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:54.829
Alex, you need more help.

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:58.188
Did Lucy choose a good one?

01:27:59.724 --> 01:28:03.205
She chose her first one.

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.073
It's ludicrous, isn't it?

01:28:12.138 --> 01:28:13.993
What?

01:28:14.058 --> 01:28:17.222
About to snuff it, and still...

01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:20.232
Still chasing tail.

01:28:20.298 --> 01:28:21.672
Huh.

01:28:25.097 --> 01:28:27.944
That's how you are.

01:28:45.733 --> 01:28:47.108
Thank you.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:55.267
Thank you for what exactly?

01:28:55.332 --> 01:28:57.186
Nothing.

01:28:57.252 --> 01:28:58.626
Right.

01:28:58.692 --> 01:28:59.902
Hee hee hee!

01:28:59.971 --> 01:29:01.498
Bye.

01:29:01.572 --> 01:29:02.946
Ciao.

01:29:56.027 --> 01:29:57.588
Ciao.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.034
Ciao.

01:30:11.993 --> 01:30:12.887
Uh.

01:30:12.953 --> 01:30:14.328
Better?

01:30:14.393 --> 01:30:16.247
Yeah.

01:30:18.712 --> 01:30:21.046
Great.
Oh, give me a ciggy, Ian.

01:30:21.111 --> 01:30:22.802
Oh, for God's sake, Alex.

01:30:22.871 --> 01:30:26.220
Have you ever actually
bought a cigarette?

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:27.408
I bought a cigarette...

01:30:27.478 --> 01:30:29.201
the last time
you bought a shirt.

01:30:32.342 --> 01:30:35.243
Alex.

01:30:35.317 --> 01:30:38.317
It's like being in a parade,
isn't it, darling?

01:30:41.076 --> 01:30:42.931
All the bloody doctor's fault.

01:30:42.996 --> 01:30:45.517
You know, I'm quite able to walk.

01:30:49.907 --> 01:30:52.722
If you could see yourselves.

01:31:04.561 --> 01:31:07.342
I don't want to see him...

01:31:07.409 --> 01:31:08.816
at the hospital.

01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:10.408
Oh, that's fine. You stay.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.335
Say good-Bye to him.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.694
Hi.

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.534
Ah, Lucy.
Let me see if you look different.

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:20.973
I didn't really.

01:31:21.039 --> 01:31:22.893
Oh, you must not mind me.

01:31:24.399 --> 01:31:27.213
I so enjoyed watching you.

01:31:28.557 --> 01:31:30.084
All that beauty.

01:31:32.078 --> 01:31:35.372
Aren't we lucky? Hmm?

01:31:41.196 --> 01:31:42.570
Ah, there's my girl.

01:31:42.636 --> 01:31:44.970
Take it with you.

01:31:45.036 --> 01:31:48.330
Mmm.
I'll share it with the nurses.

01:31:57.514 --> 01:31:58.822
See you.

01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:00.263
Mmm.

01:34:35.698 --> 01:34:38.381
Do you...
remember where you were...

01:34:38.449 --> 01:34:40.522
in August 1975?

01:34:41.936 --> 01:34:45.232
Mmm. We bought the house
in the spring of that year,

01:34:45.297 --> 01:34:47.947
So we would have
been here, I think. Why?

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:51.845
It's when I was conceived.

01:34:57.294 --> 01:34:58.669
What?

01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:00.261
Oh, nothing.

01:35:00.334 --> 01:35:01.708
You look like something.

01:35:01.774 --> 01:35:05.222
Ah, it's just that... thinking.

01:35:05.294 --> 01:35:06.820
What?

01:35:08.333 --> 01:35:12.457
I think that was when I did
your mother's portrait.

01:35:13.963 --> 01:35:16.647
That's what I thought.

01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:22.633
I couldn't be sure.

01:35:22.699 --> 01:35:26.276
Diana would remember.
But, no, no, no.

01:35:26.345 --> 01:35:28.200
She was in London then,

01:35:28.266 --> 01:35:31.299
Sorting out her divorce
and the custody of the kids.

01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:34.184
Be no point in asking her.

01:35:37.609 --> 01:35:40.869
It was one of the few times
we've ever been apart.

01:35:41.928 --> 01:35:43.968
No.
I wouldn't ask her.

01:35:50.023 --> 01:35:51.878
These are for you.

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.838
So am I... done?

01:36:11.907 --> 01:36:12.986
What?

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.914
Oh. Almost.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.273
Can I see now?

01:36:18.338 --> 01:36:21.153
I'll show it to you now,

01:36:21.218 --> 01:36:23.552
It must be our secret.

01:36:25.857 --> 01:36:27.067
Okay.

01:36:28.737 --> 01:36:31.224
You can keep a secret, can't you?

01:36:33.696 --> 01:36:35.070
Yes.

01:36:38.976 --> 01:36:41.790
I learned from the master.

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:48.445
How did you get to be
such a lovely girl?

01:37:54.676 --> 01:37:55.952
Oh!

01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.514
Fuck!

01:37:58.548 --> 01:38:00.403
Come. Come with me.

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.547
Where did they get you?

01:38:14.768 --> 01:38:16.197
Here.

01:38:16.273 --> 01:38:17.964
This clay is good for it.

01:38:19.472 --> 01:38:20.847
Are you okay?

01:38:20.913 --> 01:38:22.341
I'm not dying.

01:38:24.912 --> 01:38:28.140
And... here.

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.940
Here. You better do it.

01:38:47.884 --> 01:38:49.739
Come walk with me.

01:39:02.823 --> 01:39:04.798
So you want to come to America?

01:39:04.871 --> 01:39:06.724
I can't stand it here anymore.

01:39:06.789 --> 01:39:08.164
But it's beautiful here.

01:39:38.914 --> 01:39:39.840
Whoo!

01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:43.223
I wrote you once, you know.

01:39:43.297 --> 01:39:44.672
You did not.

01:39:44.737 --> 01:39:45.946
I didn't sign it,

01:39:46.016 --> 01:39:48.405
So you probably thought
it was from Niccolo'.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.814
What was it about?

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.025
I don't know.

01:39:52.095 --> 01:39:53.949
How much I liked you.

01:39:54.015 --> 01:39:56.022
How I thought of you
when I was in the woods.

01:39:56.095 --> 01:39:59.443
You wrote that letter?
I loved that letter.

01:39:59.518 --> 01:40:01.885
You didn't write that letter.

01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:03.772
I don't believe it.

01:40:03.838 --> 01:40:05.430
That was my favorite letter.

01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:07.192
I knew it by heart.

01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:09.017
Dear Lucy,
I'm on the top of the hill...

01:40:09.085 --> 01:40:11.092
Wait.

01:40:11.165 --> 01:40:13.204
Alone with my dog
and thinking of you.

01:40:13.276 --> 01:40:15.283
Where are you going?

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:23.922
This is my tree.

01:40:48.727 --> 01:40:50.733
You must miss your mother.

01:40:56.086 --> 01:40:58.736
I can't even picture her face.

01:41:10.996 --> 01:41:12.851
Why are you crying?

01:41:15.796 --> 01:41:18.129
Because I want to kiss you.

01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:21.969
I'm not - I'm not able.

01:41:26.354 --> 01:41:28.209
I can't.

01:41:56.301 --> 01:41:58.373
I want to leave.

01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:01.251
What?

01:42:01.324 --> 01:42:03.178
Here.

01:42:04.684 --> 01:42:06.058
What are you saying?

01:42:06.123 --> 01:42:08.457
I want to go home.

01:42:08.523 --> 01:42:11.338
This is home.

01:42:13.291 --> 01:42:15.232
Not really.

01:42:15.306 --> 01:42:18.056
This is where Daisy was born.

01:42:18.122 --> 01:42:20.031
I don't want to die here.

01:42:20.106 --> 01:42:22.887
I want to die where I belong.

01:42:22.953 --> 01:42:25.222
You're upset about Alex.

01:42:25.289 --> 01:42:29.062
And... moving is not
going to change that.

01:42:29.128 --> 01:42:32.674
I'm getting tired of
taking care of people.

01:42:32.743 --> 01:42:35.230
I want to go back.

01:42:35.303 --> 01:42:38.118
I want to go back...

01:42:38.183 --> 01:42:41.957
where it's... gray...

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:43.811
damp...

01:42:43.878 --> 01:42:46.267
and the milk goes off.

01:42:46.341 --> 01:42:51.807
I feel... I'm not...
this anymore.

01:42:51.877 --> 01:42:53.339
We can't go back, Diana.

01:42:53.413 --> 01:42:54.492
I put Richard...

01:42:54.564 --> 01:42:56.223
on the train to Pisa.

01:42:56.292 --> 01:42:57.786
Did you?

01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:59.715
I'd had it.

01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:02.593
Oh, darling, good for you.

01:43:02.659 --> 01:43:04.033
Oh, Mummy.

01:43:04.099 --> 01:43:05.954
Did you think I was mad?

01:43:06.019 --> 01:43:08.833
No.
We all have ones like that.

01:43:08.898 --> 01:43:11.233
Where is everybody?

01:43:11.298 --> 01:43:14.592
Gone. Mmm. Ha ha.

01:43:18.977 --> 01:43:20.350
Bonsoir.

01:43:20.416 --> 01:43:21.790
Bonsoir.

01:43:23.776 --> 01:43:24.670
Bonsoir.

01:43:24.736 --> 01:43:26.110
Bonsoir.

01:43:26.175 --> 01:43:27.069
Ciao.

01:43:27.135 --> 01:43:28.924
What's for dinner?

01:43:28.991 --> 01:43:30.846
I'm starving.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:36.605
Chips?

01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:38.459
Where's Lucy?

01:45:55.593 --> 01:45:58.592
Could you... help me?

01:47:01.952 --> 01:47:03.959
No. Stay.

01:47:57.079 --> 01:47:59.413
I want to come with you.

01:47:59.479 --> 01:48:01.333
Now?

01:48:01.399 --> 01:48:03.733
No. To America.

01:48:03.798 --> 01:48:05.652
Then do.

01:48:15.316 --> 01:48:16.942
It was my first time too.
