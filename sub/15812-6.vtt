01:11.500 --> 01:13.244
Numbuh 1: IN THE BEGINNING,

01:13.268 --> 01:15.033
THERE WERE CHILDREN,

01:15.100 --> 01:16.361
AND FOR A TIME,

01:16.385 --> 01:17.667
IT WAS PRETTY COOL.

01:17.733 --> 01:20.344
THE KIDS PLAYED ON THE BEACHES,

01:20.368 --> 01:23.000
EXPLORED THE WILD FORESTS,

01:23.067 --> 01:24.900
AND RELAXED IN THE FIELDS.

01:24.967 --> 01:27.111
THE WORLD WAS THEIR BIG,

01:27.135 --> 01:29.300
ENDLESS PLAYGROUND.

01:29.367 --> 01:31.600
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:31.667 --> 01:33.027
THEY BUILT THEMSELVES

01:33.051 --> 01:34.433
SIMPLE TREE HOUSES,

01:34.500 --> 01:35.994
AND THEY LIVED WITHOUT RULES

01:36.018 --> 01:37.533
OR NAP TIMES.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.061
BUT IT WAS NOT LONG

01:39.085 --> 01:40.567
BEFORE THEY BECAME BORED,

01:40.633 --> 01:41.933
AS CHILDREN DO.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.427
SOON THEIR PERFECT SOCIETY

01:45.451 --> 01:48.900
GAVE WAY TO LAZINESS.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.367
THUS DID CHILDREN DECIDE

01:53.433 --> 01:54.677
TO CREATE ADULTS

01:54.701 --> 01:55.967
IN THEIR OWN IMAGE,

01:56.033 --> 01:57.227
ONLY FATTER, FUNNIER-LOOKING,

01:57.251 --> 01:58.467
AND BIGGER,

01:58.533 --> 02:00.544
SO THEY COULD REACH CEREAL BOXES

02:00.568 --> 02:02.600
ON HIGH SHELVES.

02:12.367 --> 02:15.533
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:20.500 --> 02:22.377
THE CHILDREN DRESSED THE ADULTS

02:22.401 --> 02:24.300
IN STUPID OUTFITS

02:24.367 --> 02:25.833
SO THEY COULD LAUGH AT THEM

02:25.900 --> 02:27.927
AND GIVE THEM GOOFY NAMES

02:27.951 --> 02:30.000
LIKE MR. PLOPPIT.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.677
THEY ADULTS,

02:31.701 --> 02:32.767
LOYAL AND EAGER TO PLEASE,

02:32.833 --> 02:34.210
WORKED TIRELESSLY TO DO

02:34.234 --> 02:35.633
THE CHILDREN'S BIDDING,

02:35.700 --> 02:37.177
MAKING THEM PEANUT BUTTER

02:37.201 --> 02:38.700
AND JELLY SANDWICHES,

02:38.767 --> 02:40.433
CLEANING UP ALL OF THEIR MESSES,

02:40.500 --> 02:41.944
AND BUILDING LARGER

02:41.968 --> 02:43.433
AND MORE ELABORATE TREE HOUSES

02:43.500 --> 02:45.867
FOR CHILDREN TO PLAY IN.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.800
OHH! OH! OW! OHH-OH!

02:49.867 --> 02:51.994
AND YET THE ADULTS GOT

02:52.018 --> 02:54.167
NO RESPECT FROM CHILDREN,

02:54.233 --> 02:55.927
THESE STRANGE,

02:55.951 --> 02:57.667
SHORT-LEGGED CREATURES

02:57.733 --> 02:59.060
WITH SNOT RUNNING DOWN

02:59.084 --> 03:00.433
THEIR NOSES.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.527
WITH THE ADULTS

03:01.551 --> 03:02.600
ALREADY OVERWORKED

03:02.667 --> 03:04.577
- AND GIVEN NO TIME - TO THEMSELVES,

03:04.667 --> 03:05.877
THE CHILDREN DEMANDED

03:05.901 --> 03:07.133
THAT THEY CONSTRUCT

03:07.200 --> 03:08.761
THE COOLEST MONUMENT YET...

03:08.785 --> 03:10.367
A GRAND TREE HOUSE,

03:10.433 --> 03:11.960
ONE LARGER THAN ALL

03:11.984 --> 03:13.533
THE TREE HOUSES BEFORE IT

03:13.600 --> 03:15.377
THAT ALL OF KID-DOM

03:15.401 --> 03:17.200
COULD LIVE IN AND PLAY,

03:17.267 --> 03:18.433
AND THEY CALLED IT

03:18.500 --> 03:19.994
"THE SUPER-DOUBLE-MEGA-TRIPLE

03:20.018 --> 03:21.533
TREE HOUSE."

03:21.600 --> 03:22.894
THE ADULTS WORKED ENDLESSLY

03:22.918 --> 03:24.233
AROUND THE CLOCK

03:24.300 --> 03:25.311
TO KEEP THIS SEEMINGLY

03:25.335 --> 03:26.367
IMPOSSIBLE VISION,

03:26.433 --> 03:27.977
WHILE STILL KEEPING UP

03:28.001 --> 03:29.567
WITH THEIR COOKING, LAWN-MOWING,

03:29.633 --> 03:30.927
AND ATTENDING

03:30.951 --> 03:32.267
TO THEIR CHILDREN'S WHIMS,

03:32.333 --> 03:34.033
LIKE PLAYING HORSEY...

03:34.100 --> 03:35.200
[ HOOTS ]

03:35.267 --> 03:36.567
OH, GIDDYUP, BOY!

03:36.633 --> 03:38.910
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SEEDS

03:38.934 --> 03:41.233
OF DISSENT TOOK ROOT.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.944
MR. WIGGLESTEIN... A NAME

03:43.968 --> 03:46.633
THAT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.727
HE WAS THE FIRST OF HIS KIND

03:48.751 --> 03:50.800
TO RISE UP AGAINST CHILDREN

03:50.867 --> 03:52.400
IN WHAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN

03:52.467 --> 03:53.977
AS "THE REALLY BAD THING

03:54.001 --> 03:55.533
THAT HAPPENED."

03:55.600 --> 03:57.900
AT MR. WIGGLESTEIN'S TRIAL,

03:57.967 --> 03:59.711
THE PROSECUTION ARGUED FOR

03:59.735 --> 04:01.500
A CHILD'S RIGHT TO PLAY HORSEY

04:01.567 --> 04:03.161
WHENEVER AND AS MUCH

04:03.185 --> 04:04.800
AS HE OR SHE WANTED.

04:04.867 --> 04:06.700
BUT MR. WIGGLESTEIN TESTIFIED

04:06.767 --> 04:08.377
- THAT HE HAD - HAD A ROUGH DAY AT WORK

04:08.467 --> 04:10.310
- AND JUST DIDN'T FEEL - LIKE PLAYING HORSEY.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.711
PRESSED TO THE POINT OF MADNESS

04:12.735 --> 04:15.067
BY HIS CHILD'S CONSTANT WHINING,

04:15.133 --> 04:17.767
MR. WIGGLESTEIN FINALLY SNAPPED.

04:17.833 --> 04:18.810
IN A BLIND RAGE,

04:18.834 --> 04:19.834
HE GRABBED THE CHILD

04:19.900 --> 04:21.627
AND RAPIDLY PADDLED HIS BOTTOM

04:21.651 --> 04:23.400
WITH HIS HAND.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.210
- THIS NEW, - RATHER STING-Y ACT,

04:25.300 --> 04:26.577
WAS FROM THEN ON CALLED

04:26.601 --> 04:27.900
"SPANKING"

04:27.967 --> 04:29.094
AND FOREVER CHANGED

04:29.118 --> 04:30.267
THE RELATIONSHIP

04:30.333 --> 04:32.500
BETWEEN KIDS AND ADULTS.

04:32.567 --> 04:33.933
THE FURIOUS LEADERS OF CHILDREN

04:34.000 --> 04:35.694
QUICKLY ORDERED THE IMMEDIATE

04:35.718 --> 04:37.433
EXILE OF MR. WIGGLESTEIN

04:37.500 --> 04:39.661
AND EVERY ONE OF HIS KIND FROM

04:39.685 --> 04:41.867
EVERY TREE HOUSE ON THE PLANET.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.400
BANISHED FROM CHILDLAND,

04:43.467 --> 04:45.094
THE ADULTS SET OFF TO FIND

04:45.118 --> 04:46.767
THEIR OWN PROMISED LAND,

04:46.833 --> 04:48.133
A PLACE WITHOUT TREE HOUSES,

04:48.200 --> 04:49.294
WHERE CHILDREN

04:49.318 --> 04:50.433
WOULDN'T ALWAYS COMPLAIN

04:50.500 --> 04:51.627
AND JUMP UP AND DOWN

04:51.651 --> 04:52.800
ON THE BED...

04:52.867 --> 04:54.433
A PLACE THEY COULD CALL HOME.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.627
THEY CHRISTENED THIS NEW PLACE

04:56.651 --> 04:58.800
"CLEVELAND,"

04:58.867 --> 05:00.800
AND IN TIME, IT PROSPERED.

05:00.867 --> 05:01.877
THE ADULTS BUILT

05:01.901 --> 05:02.933
SUBURBAN HOUSES,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.727
WENT TO LECTURE SERIES,

05:05.751 --> 05:08.500
AND ATE LIVERWURST SANDWICHES.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.461
EVENTUALLY, THEIR INDUSTRIES

05:12.485 --> 05:13.900
BRED PRODUCTS

05:13.967 --> 05:15.361
THAT NOT EVEN CHILDHOOD

05:15.385 --> 05:16.800
COULD RESIST.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.833
AND THEY CALLED THEM "TOYS."

05:19.900 --> 05:22.867
BUT THE ADULTS' DEMAND FOR MONEY

05:22.933 --> 05:24.377
MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR CHILDREN

05:24.401 --> 05:25.867
TO OBTAIN THESE TOYS

05:25.933 --> 05:28.277
WITHOUT HAVING TO STOOP TO TASKS

05:28.301 --> 05:30.667
LIKE DELIVERING NEWSPAPERS

05:30.733 --> 05:34.100
AND MOWING LAWNS FOR THE ADULTS.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.100
THE CHILDREN WERE OUTRAGED.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.694
WHY SHOULD THEY BE FORCED TO PAY

05:37.718 --> 05:39.267
FOR THE ADULTS' CREATIONS

05:39.333 --> 05:40.710
WHEN THE ADULTS WERE CREATIONS

05:40.734 --> 05:42.133
OF THEIR OWN?

05:42.200 --> 05:43.811
MANY AMONG THEM WISHED

05:43.835 --> 05:45.467
TO SIMPLY TAKE THE TOYS

05:45.533 --> 05:46.933
BUT KNEW THEY COULD NOT DO SO,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.177
SO LONG AS ADULTS HELD

05:48.201 --> 05:49.400
THE PAINFUL THREAT

05:49.467 --> 05:50.600
OF SPANKING OVER THEM.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.177
SO THE CHILDREN DEVISED

05:52.201 --> 05:53.733
A DESPERATE ACT,

05:53.800 --> 05:55.611
ONE THAT KIDS WOULD ATTEMPT

05:55.635 --> 05:57.467
AGAIN IN THE FUTURE

05:57.533 --> 05:58.660
WITH SIMILARLY DISASTROUS

05:58.684 --> 05:59.833

05:59.900 --> 06:01.794
THE DESTRUCTION OF COFFEE,

06:01.818 --> 06:03.733
THE ADULTS' ENERGY SOURCE.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.361
WITHOUT IT, THE CHILDREN

06:06.385 --> 06:08.967
COULD MARCH RIGHT INTO CLEVELAND

06:09.033 --> 06:10.727
AND TAKE THE TOYS FROM

06:10.751 --> 06:12.467
THE CRANKY AND POWERLESS ADULTS.

06:12.533 --> 06:14.160

06:14.184 --> 06:15.833
OF CLEVELAND'S COFFEE SHOPS

06:15.900 --> 06:16.833

TROOPS ADVANCE OUTWARD

08:09.600 --> 08:11.000
IN EVERY DIRECTION,

08:11.067 --> 08:12.727
AND ONE BY ONE, THE TREE HOUSES

08:12.751 --> 08:14.433
OF CHILDREN FELL.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.911
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE

08:15.935 --> 08:17.367
CHILDHOOD'S GREATEST MONUMENT,

08:17.433 --> 08:19.677
THE VERY SYMBOL OF THEIR GREED,

08:19.701 --> 08:21.967
CAME UNDER ATTACK,

08:22.033 --> 08:24.200
AND THE CHILDREN RAN AWAY.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.000
WITH THE FALL

08:30.067 --> 08:32.077
- OF THE SUPER-DOUBLE-MEGA-TRIPLE - TREE HOUSE,

08:32.167 --> 08:33.477
THE CHILDREN FELL BACK

08:33.501 --> 08:34.833
TO THE ONLY REMAINING PLACE

08:34.900 --> 08:37.144
WHERE THEY COULD ESCAPE

THE POWERFUL ADULTS... THE MOON.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.644
- SATISFIED WITH THEIR VICTORY - OVER THE EARTH,

08:41.733 --> 08:43.160
THE ADULTS ALLOWED THE CHILDREN

08:43.184 --> 08:44.633
TO LIVE ON THE MOON,

08:44.700 --> 08:45.827
WHERE THEY COULD MAKE

08:45.851 --> 08:47.000
ALL THE NOISE THEY WANTED

AND STAY UP ALL NIGHT EATING

08:49.251 --> 08:51.433

08:51.500 --> 08:52.661
AND FOR A TIME,

08:52.685 --> 08:53.867
IT WASN'T SO BAD.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.444
BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE

08:55.468 --> 08:57.000
CHILDREN BEGAN TO YEARN

08:57.067 --> 08:59.010
- FOR THE OCEANS - THEY ONCE SWAM IN,

AND THE TOYS THEY ONCE

09:02.218 --> 09:03.767
PLAYED WITH ON EARTH.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.200
IT WAS AT THIS VERY SAME TIME

09:05.267 --> 09:06.927
THAT ADULTS FELL VICTIM TO THE

09:06.951 --> 09:08.633
SAME SINS OF LAZINESS AND GREED

09:08.700 --> 09:10.011
THAT HAD BEFALLEN THE CHILDREN

09:10.035 --> 09:11.367
BEFORE THEM.

09:11.433 --> 09:13.077

AND SHOVELING SNOW

09:17.268 --> 09:18.333
FROM THEIR DRIVEWAYS.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.844
SO THE ADULT AMBASSADORS

09:19.868 --> 09:21.333
CAME TO THE MOON BASE

WITH PLANS FOR A CIVIL, STABLE

AND LIVE TOGETHER WITH ADULTS

IN SMALL GROUPINGS

09:36.418 --> 09:38.233
CALLED "FAMILIES."

09:38.300 --> 09:40.894
CHILDREN AND ADULTS COULD

09:40.918 --> 09:43.533
FINALLY LIVE TOGETHER AS EQUALS.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.267
OR COULD THEY?!

09:45.333 --> 09:46.610
SOON AFTERWARDS,

09:46.634 --> 09:47.933
THE ADULTS CREATED PLACES

09:48.000 --> 09:49.044
TO IMPRISON CHILDREN

09:49.068 --> 09:50.133
CALLED "SCHOOLS"
