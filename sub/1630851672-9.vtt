WEBVTT

00:01.932 --> 00:04.848
Someplace safe from all this,
with plans to rebuild.

00:07.634 --> 00:08.939
She's the one
we've been waiting for.

00:08.983 --> 00:11.203
And that's gonna lead us
to our new beginning.

00:13.248 --> 00:15.076
I didn't amputate my arm
in time.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.904
The infection is
still inside me.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.732
And it's only
a matter of time.

00:18.775 --> 00:22.040
I am taking the one thing
that matters to you the most.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.172
I am taking that tower.

00:24.216 --> 00:26.435
I'll protect it
if I must.

00:26.479 --> 00:28.655
Then we're going to war.

00:37.925 --> 00:40.232
Padre...

00:43.887 --> 00:47.239
Follow me.

00:47.282 --> 00:48.892
Who said that?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.078
Hey!

01:00.121 --> 01:02.863
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:02.906 --> 01:04.169
Hey!

01:09.957 --> 01:11.785
What is that?!

01:17.312 --> 01:18.357
Hey!

01:21.751 --> 01:22.970
Hey!

01:23.013 --> 01:25.320
Padre...

01:28.193 --> 01:30.499
Padre...

01:30.543 --> 01:32.153
Hey.

01:32.197 --> 01:36.723
Padre, follow me.

01:39.595 --> 01:42.381
Padre.

01:42.424 --> 01:43.773
What did you say?

01:43.817 --> 01:44.948
Padre.

01:46.428 --> 01:48.082
Follow me.

01:48.126 --> 01:50.128
Follow me.

01:50.171 --> 01:51.825
Follow me.

01:51.868 --> 01:55.742
Follow me.

02:46.662 --> 02:48.403
Hello?

02:51.624 --> 02:54.714
Is someone here?

04:01.607 --> 04:02.738
Hey.

04:04.653 --> 04:05.654
Turn it off!

04:13.009 --> 04:14.228
Behind you!

04:41.211 --> 04:42.300
What did you do?!

04:49.002 --> 04:51.004
Oh, no.

04:51.047 --> 04:53.354
No, no, no!

04:55.225 --> 04:57.880
What did you do?!

05:48.627 --> 05:51.760
Damn it.

05:51.804 --> 05:53.022
Hey.

05:53.066 --> 05:54.633
Hello?

05:54.676 --> 05:56.504
How did I get here?

06:00.813 --> 06:03.511
Hey, I'm talking to you.

06:03.555 --> 06:05.470
Hey.

06:08.037 --> 06:10.257
Easy.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.172
Didn't you hear me?

06:12.215 --> 06:14.957
No. I didn't.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.395
I haven't heard a goddamn thing
in months.

06:22.225 --> 06:24.489
What's going on?
How did I get here?

06:24.532 --> 06:26.273
You're gonna have to speak
a lot slower

06:26.316 --> 06:29.624
if you expect me
to read your lips.

06:29.668 --> 06:32.453
Oh.

06:32.497 --> 06:35.064
How long
have I been out?

06:35.108 --> 06:36.849
Two days.

06:36.892 --> 06:39.112
How did I get here?

06:39.155 --> 06:40.330
I brought you here.

06:40.374 --> 06:42.071
I was coming back
from a food run.

06:42.115 --> 06:46.859
Found you passed out in a barn
about two miles north.

06:46.902 --> 06:49.296
Good thing I came along
when I did.

06:49.339 --> 06:52.473
I-I-I checked on you,
saw your arm --

06:52.517 --> 06:55.215
or what's left of your arm.

06:55.258 --> 06:57.652
That's quite a statement.

06:59.828 --> 07:01.613
I got bit.

07:04.703 --> 07:06.356
I wasn't gonna let him
take it from me.

07:07.923 --> 07:11.231
I figured if it had come
from a bite,

07:11.274 --> 07:13.494
you would've turned
by now.

07:13.538 --> 07:16.497
What's left of it
didn't look infected.

07:16.541 --> 07:19.544
Still,
you were burning up

07:19.587 --> 07:22.155
no matter how much medicine
I gave you.

07:22.198 --> 07:25.898
So why are you idling
so hot?

07:25.941 --> 07:27.290
You sick?

07:27.334 --> 07:30.511
No.
That's not it.

07:30.555 --> 07:32.165
Then what is it?

07:34.733 --> 07:36.865
I wasn't in a barn.

07:50.966 --> 07:54.143
I was on my way back...

07:54.187 --> 07:55.623
to the people
I was staying with.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.886
I...

07:57.930 --> 08:01.063
I must've passed out.

08:01.107 --> 08:02.891
But I wasn't in a barn.

08:02.935 --> 08:04.545
A girl saved me.

08:04.589 --> 08:06.678
I didn't see a girl.

08:06.721 --> 08:09.202
Maybe she got you
to the barn.

08:09.245 --> 08:10.856
What is it exactly
you were running from

08:10.899 --> 08:12.510
in the first place?

08:12.553 --> 08:13.902
Um...

08:16.818 --> 08:18.733
I-I appreciate
your help.

08:18.777 --> 08:21.431
I, um...

08:21.475 --> 08:22.911
I really have to go.

08:22.955 --> 08:25.305
There are people
that are counting on me.

08:25.348 --> 08:26.524
Your dad?

08:28.613 --> 08:31.703
You kept saying "Padre"
over and over in your sleep.

08:31.746 --> 08:34.140
I-I must've
been confused.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.535
Hold on a second.

08:39.449 --> 08:42.017
Youbroke my stereo.

08:42.061 --> 08:44.106
After what I did
for you,

08:44.150 --> 08:45.934
the least you can do
is help me fix it.

08:45.978 --> 08:48.371
I'm really sorry,
but I-I have to go.

08:48.415 --> 08:50.112
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.723
Hey, back off!

08:53.855 --> 08:56.902
You're in no shape
to go anywhere.

09:00.427 --> 09:02.777
I'm Paul, by the way.

09:05.998 --> 09:08.391
You never answered
my question before.

09:08.435 --> 09:10.263
About your fever.

09:21.491 --> 09:23.668
It's a long story.

09:23.711 --> 09:25.365
You're gonna have to do a lot
better than that.

09:25.408 --> 09:27.933
The reason you're still
breathing is 'cause of me.

09:27.976 --> 09:29.630
Look,
I returned the favor.

09:29.674 --> 09:31.763
That music you're blasting
was drawing walkers here.

09:31.806 --> 09:34.635
Because the lock
on the damn door gave.

09:34.679 --> 09:36.811
I got the house
soundproofed.

09:36.855 --> 09:40.989
I can play my music
as loud as I want.

09:41.033 --> 09:43.688
I thought you said you hadn't
heard anything in months.

09:49.084 --> 09:52.392
When Beethoven
first started going deaf...

09:52.435 --> 09:56.265
he destroyed every piano
they put in front of him,

09:56.309 --> 09:59.007
just smashed the keys

09:59.051 --> 10:02.097
like his fingers
were sledgehammers.

10:02.141 --> 10:03.359
Why?

10:03.403 --> 10:06.058
Just 'cause
you can't hearmusic

10:06.101 --> 10:09.670
don't mean
you can't feelit.

10:09.714 --> 10:12.020
Is that why all your instruments
are broken?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.807
Out of tune.

10:19.114 --> 10:22.552
What about that one?

10:22.596 --> 10:23.771
I don't play those.

10:23.815 --> 10:26.208
Why not?
I just don't.

10:34.521 --> 10:36.479
Damn it.

10:38.481 --> 10:39.700
Hide me.
Hide me.

10:39.744 --> 10:41.354
He can't know I'm here.Why?

10:41.397 --> 10:42.790
Please.
Okay.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.052
Okay.

10:50.885 --> 10:52.278
Hey, there.

10:54.976 --> 10:57.109
Something I can
help you boys with.

10:57.152 --> 10:59.154
We're looking
for somebody.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.550
I can't hear shit.

11:03.593 --> 11:05.595
So, if you got
something to say,

11:05.639 --> 11:07.989
you're gonna have
to show your face.
Hmm.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.296
Wind hasn't kicked up anything
dangerous in weeks.

11:15.693 --> 11:16.824
How's that?

11:18.434 --> 11:20.915
I'm looking
for somebody.

11:20.959 --> 11:22.525
A woman.

11:22.569 --> 11:24.919
You're out of luck.

11:24.963 --> 11:27.487
Ain't nobody here but me.Hmm.

11:30.577 --> 11:31.926
What are you carting
around there?

11:31.970 --> 11:34.102
Oh. That. Yeah.

11:34.146 --> 11:36.888
Um...

11:36.931 --> 11:38.237
Hey!

11:42.589 --> 11:45.200
I say you could come in,
asshole?

11:45.244 --> 11:46.724
You sick?

11:48.769 --> 11:50.162
You got a fever?

11:50.205 --> 11:51.380
Get out of my house.

11:51.424 --> 11:53.905
Hmm.
The reason I'm asking is,

11:53.948 --> 11:58.866
the girl I'm looking for,
she gets fevers.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.607
She was bit by the dead.

12:00.650 --> 12:04.785
Lost her arm because of it,
but didn't turn her.

12:04.829 --> 12:06.787
Hmm.

12:06.831 --> 12:08.876
And yet, she's still
walking around.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.313
I told you,
I ain't seen her.

12:11.357 --> 12:13.707
Doesn't seem like
a very considerate thing to do,

12:13.751 --> 12:16.188
if you ask me, but...

12:16.231 --> 12:19.321
ah, then again,

12:19.365 --> 12:23.021
she has a habit
of getting people hurt.

12:23.064 --> 12:25.023
What do you want
with her?

12:25.066 --> 12:27.155
Ah, that's between
me and her.

12:39.472 --> 12:41.779
Piano's broken.

12:41.822 --> 12:43.998
Just out of tune's all.

12:44.042 --> 12:44.999
You sure?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.570
I'm sure.

13:05.846 --> 13:07.848
Alright, then.

13:10.982 --> 13:13.375
You see her,
you give me a call.

13:17.902 --> 13:19.642
I'll do that.

13:27.259 --> 13:29.652
Deaf musician.

13:31.219 --> 13:33.047
Ain't that a bitch?

13:33.091 --> 13:35.006
Appreciate your time.

13:51.761 --> 13:54.068
What did
he want with you?

13:54.112 --> 13:56.288
Is it true
what he said?

13:56.331 --> 13:59.857
About you
getting folks hurt?

13:59.900 --> 14:01.510
We lived
at the same place,

14:01.554 --> 14:04.731
and things went bad,
and he blames me.

14:04.774 --> 14:06.167
Is he right to?

14:06.211 --> 14:07.865
He doesn't like
where I led everyone.

14:07.908 --> 14:09.388
We had to abandon
where we were living

14:09.431 --> 14:13.696
because the blast
compromised the structure.

14:13.740 --> 14:15.481
Where was that?

14:19.789 --> 14:23.141
Well, you seem
nice enough to me.

14:23.184 --> 14:25.230
Then again...

14:25.273 --> 14:28.842
I may just be grateful
for the company.

14:28.886 --> 14:30.278
Bon appÃ©tit.

14:46.207 --> 14:49.558
I -- I take it you've
never had haggis.

14:49.602 --> 14:51.169
Mnh-mnh.

14:51.212 --> 14:53.345
Rowan was Scottish.

14:53.388 --> 14:56.087
Always kept cans of this stuff
in the pantry,

14:56.130 --> 14:58.176
and if I'm being honest,

14:58.219 --> 14:59.873
I had the same reaction
as you did

14:59.917 --> 15:01.353
when I first tried it.

15:01.396 --> 15:04.399
But I, um...

15:04.443 --> 15:06.706
I grew to like it.

15:06.749 --> 15:08.751
And when
you're scavenging,

15:08.795 --> 15:11.711
you'd be surprised
how easy it is to find.

15:11.754 --> 15:15.149
Whole grocery stores
picked clean,

15:15.193 --> 15:17.151
save for that stuff.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.335
Rowan, is she your...

15:27.379 --> 15:29.642
Was.

15:29.685 --> 15:31.209
My wife.

15:35.039 --> 15:36.431
What happened?

15:38.607 --> 15:41.610
The bombs did.

15:41.654 --> 15:43.134
Lost her

15:43.177 --> 15:45.788
and what's left of my hearing
on that same day.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.794
I'm sorry.

15:51.838 --> 15:53.753
So am I.

15:55.842 --> 15:57.931
I'm going to turn in.
We leave at dawn.

15:57.975 --> 15:59.193
Find us a new stereo.

15:59.237 --> 16:01.195
Uh, look, um...

16:01.239 --> 16:03.110
I appreciate everything
you've done,

16:03.154 --> 16:06.809
but I-I really do
have to go.

16:06.853 --> 16:08.420
You can't leave.
No.

16:08.463 --> 16:10.988
I'm not the person
you think I am.

16:11.031 --> 16:12.206
Well,
you're gonna have to be.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.121
Why won't you
let me go?

16:14.165 --> 16:15.993
Why are you in
such a hurry to?

16:18.865 --> 16:21.476
Because what Arno said about me
is true.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.001
Look, a lot of people got hurt
because of me,

16:24.044 --> 16:25.524
and I don't want that
to happen again.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.222
What happened in that place
you were at before?

16:28.266 --> 16:29.919
Why is the guy
really after you?

16:29.963 --> 16:30.833
It doesn't matter.

16:30.877 --> 16:33.053
Then what does?

16:33.097 --> 16:34.489
Getting back
to my friends.

16:34.533 --> 16:35.751
Their lives
are at stake.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.405
So is mine.

16:41.714 --> 16:43.194
You leave me here

16:43.237 --> 16:46.458
without helping me
find that stereo,

16:46.501 --> 16:50.157
I'm as good as dead.

16:50.201 --> 16:53.682
You help me get
what I want,

16:53.726 --> 16:56.076
I'll make sure you get back
to your people in one piece.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.036
Look, I don't even know
where to find...

16:59.079 --> 17:01.603
what you're looking for.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.214
I do.

17:18.272 --> 17:20.448
You never told me.

17:22.755 --> 17:24.104
How'd you wind up bit?

17:24.148 --> 17:26.498
Same way
most people do.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.326
Trying to get out
of a bad situation.

17:28.369 --> 17:31.981
Does it have something
to with PADRE?

17:33.940 --> 17:35.681
I told you --

17:35.724 --> 17:38.292
you was talking about it
in your dreams.

17:38.336 --> 17:40.468
Must have meant
something to you.

17:43.515 --> 17:45.169
It's a place.

17:49.782 --> 17:52.393
Somewhere I thought
I could take everyone.

17:52.437 --> 17:54.308
Somewhere I thought
they'd be safe.

17:56.136 --> 17:58.791
And people died
along the way.

17:58.834 --> 18:01.837
That's why
Arno's after you?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.274
So...

18:05.189 --> 18:06.146
...what's the new plan?

18:06.190 --> 18:07.930
There's a new place.

18:07.974 --> 18:09.454
Or there will be.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.108
The person
who's running it

18:11.151 --> 18:13.371
is doing everything they can
to keep people out,

18:13.414 --> 18:15.982
and I was trying
to get Arno and his people

18:16.025 --> 18:19.986
to fight for it
with us.

18:20.029 --> 18:23.032
Doesn't sound
like you convinced them.

18:23.076 --> 18:24.686
He wasn't happy
to see me.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.385
He said I shouldn't
be leading anyone anywhere.

18:27.428 --> 18:31.258
And...honestly,
he's probably right.

18:33.434 --> 18:35.349
So it didn't work out
with PADRE.

18:35.393 --> 18:37.177
Big deal.
You tried.

18:37.221 --> 18:39.005
And people died.

18:39.048 --> 18:41.355
Did you put a gun
to their head

18:41.399 --> 18:44.184
and force them
to follow you over there?

18:44.228 --> 18:45.577
There must've
been a reason

18:45.620 --> 18:49.189
for you to think
this is the way to go.

18:49.233 --> 18:51.931
Yeah, I did.

18:51.974 --> 18:53.541
Then why
beat yourself up?

19:00.244 --> 19:02.333
Beethoven's ninth.

19:05.205 --> 19:08.730
Last concert
we ever had here.

19:08.774 --> 19:12.169
Back when
it first premiered,

19:12.212 --> 19:16.521
Beethoven insisted
that he conduct it himself.

19:19.045 --> 19:21.047
When it ended...

19:21.090 --> 19:23.223
the house went nuts.

19:23.267 --> 19:26.095
Standing ovation.

19:26.139 --> 19:28.533
Of course,
he couldn't hear it.

19:28.576 --> 19:30.230
Story goes

19:30.274 --> 19:34.408
that some
young contralto

19:34.452 --> 19:37.411
spun him around
so he could see

19:37.455 --> 19:42.547
how they loved
what they heard.

19:44.244 --> 19:46.986
What instrument
did you play?

19:47.029 --> 19:48.248
I was piano.

19:48.292 --> 19:51.643
Rowan -- violin.

19:51.686 --> 19:53.906
Played a lot of instruments,
actually.

19:53.949 --> 19:55.647
Bagpipes?

19:55.690 --> 19:58.867
Sorry.
It's not my business.

19:58.911 --> 20:01.261
They were hers.

20:01.305 --> 20:03.916
I got them
for her 40th birthday.

20:03.959 --> 20:06.266
Even learned how
to play them myself.

20:06.310 --> 20:09.487
Part of my, uh,
Scottish education.

20:11.315 --> 20:14.492
She had an arrangement
of "Ode to Joy"

20:14.535 --> 20:16.189
all figured out
for those pipes.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.278
That was her dream.

20:18.322 --> 20:20.062
But she never
got to play it.

20:20.106 --> 20:22.717
When my hearing
started going,

20:22.761 --> 20:24.676
she thought maybe

20:24.719 --> 20:27.809
I just might be able
to hear that.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.246
Bagpipes --

20:29.289 --> 20:32.510
so damn loud.

20:32.553 --> 20:35.077
Why didn't she play
the arrangement?

20:39.343 --> 20:42.389
I told her that's not how
it was meant to be played,

20:42.433 --> 20:46.654
but really, I --
I...

20:46.698 --> 20:50.484
I was just so damn mad

20:50.528 --> 20:53.313
at my world going quiet

20:53.357 --> 20:54.880
that I took it out
on her.

21:01.408 --> 21:03.628
You don't have to go back
to that house, you know?

21:05.586 --> 21:07.327
You don't have to
live all alone like this.

21:10.156 --> 21:11.984
What else would I do?

21:12.027 --> 21:14.203
Come with me.

21:14.247 --> 21:16.510
My friends --
the more people we have,

21:16.554 --> 21:17.729
the sooner
we can take that place

21:17.772 --> 21:19.426
I was talking to you about.

21:20.993 --> 21:23.300
Hmm.

21:23.343 --> 21:24.736
What's wrong?

21:24.779 --> 21:26.433
Wait here.

21:37.966 --> 21:39.054
Shit.

21:42.231 --> 21:44.843
Figured I might
find you here.

21:50.762 --> 21:53.504
I'm not alone.I figured that, too.

21:55.941 --> 21:57.334
Come on out.

21:57.377 --> 21:59.597
Oh, right. Yeah.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.164
He can't hear us.

22:06.255 --> 22:10.042
You never learn,
do you, Alicia?

22:10.085 --> 22:12.610
Did you promise him
somewhere you could go,

22:12.653 --> 22:13.654
somewhere safe
you could take him?

22:13.698 --> 22:16.222
I thought PADRE
was gonna work.

22:16.265 --> 22:17.310
Tell it to them.

22:28.060 --> 22:29.191
You're insane.

22:29.235 --> 22:30.410
I'minsane?

22:30.454 --> 22:31.585
You're the one
who asked them to find

22:31.629 --> 22:33.413
the late, great
Senator Vazquez

22:33.457 --> 22:35.937
so he could lead us
to the promised land.

22:35.981 --> 22:37.504
How'd that go,
by the way?

22:40.464 --> 22:42.901
You should put them
to rest.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.163
Yeah.

22:44.206 --> 22:45.599
Yeah, I should.

22:45.643 --> 22:47.949
You know,
I was going to...

22:47.993 --> 22:50.604
but then I thought
it'd be way more fun

22:50.648 --> 22:53.215
to let them punish you
for what you did.

22:53.259 --> 22:55.043
Wait, wait. Stop.

22:55.087 --> 22:56.828
Wait! Wait!

22:56.871 --> 22:59.308
Wait!

22:59.352 --> 23:00.788
No! Wait. Please!

23:14.715 --> 23:18.197
They're dead
because of you.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.853
They're dead because you said
you knew the way!

23:27.119 --> 23:30.122
Seems only fair
that you join them, Alicia.

23:31.950 --> 23:34.256
You're halfway there,
anyway.

23:36.868 --> 23:37.695
No.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.222
Get down!

24:04.243 --> 24:06.288
Aah!

24:16.647 --> 24:17.604
Paul!

24:21.390 --> 24:23.131
What are you doing?

24:23.175 --> 24:25.525
I can fix it.
Get in!

24:37.102 --> 24:38.364
I have to get it back.

24:38.407 --> 24:40.975
Stop, stop.
It's just a stereo.

24:41.019 --> 24:43.021
No, it's not!

24:43.064 --> 24:45.806
It's the only thing
that could drown it out.

24:45.850 --> 24:46.764
Drown what out?

24:46.807 --> 24:48.461
Her voice!

24:56.513 --> 25:00.038
She was on her way back
when it happened.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.648
She was so...

25:01.692 --> 25:03.432
scared.

25:05.696 --> 25:07.567
I tried to calm her,

25:07.611 --> 25:10.135
told her everything
was gonna be okay.

25:10.178 --> 25:13.704
I told her to stay on the radio
with me.

25:13.747 --> 25:15.401
Then it happened.

25:15.444 --> 25:19.318
That warhead
came crashing down

25:19.361 --> 25:24.889
with this horrible,
high-pitched whine.

25:24.932 --> 25:27.282
Then she screamed.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.284
Then everything
just went...

25:29.328 --> 25:31.504
quiet.

25:31.548 --> 25:36.335
That was the last thing
I ever heard.

25:36.378 --> 25:38.685
Her scream!

25:38.729 --> 25:40.687
My Rowan.

25:40.731 --> 25:42.646
I couldn't go on hearing it,
Alicia.

25:42.689 --> 25:44.473
I just can't.

25:44.517 --> 25:45.518
You --

25:45.562 --> 25:49.566
You couldn't possibly
understand.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.528
I can.

26:00.315 --> 26:01.926
How?

26:01.969 --> 26:06.104
Because I have a voice
I can't get rid of, either.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.323
What voice?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.325
The one
from my dream.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.113
What dream?

26:15.156 --> 26:16.723
The dream I've been having
for months,

26:16.767 --> 26:19.596
the dream
I keep having.

26:19.639 --> 26:21.641
You asked me
why I thought PADRE

26:21.685 --> 26:25.993
was the place
I had to take everyone.

26:26.037 --> 26:28.561
That's why.

26:28.605 --> 26:30.128
That must have
been some dream.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.173
First time I had it
was after I got bit.

26:32.217 --> 26:34.654
I didn't know...

26:34.698 --> 26:36.525
whether I'd cut my arm off
in time

26:36.569 --> 26:38.136
or whether I was gonna bleed out
or turn.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.790
But you didn't.

26:39.833 --> 26:42.183
I don't know how long I was out.
Days, maybe.

26:42.227 --> 26:45.099
My fever was spiking,
and I had this dream.

26:49.669 --> 26:52.324
It was the most vivid dream
I've ever had.

26:55.719 --> 26:56.981
About what?

26:57.024 --> 26:57.982
A walker.

26:58.025 --> 26:59.331
And I was following it.

27:04.989 --> 27:06.164
But it wasn't just me.

27:06.207 --> 27:09.384
It was...
all of them, too.

27:13.954 --> 27:16.435
And I finally caught up
to the walker, and he --

27:16.478 --> 27:18.393
he turned around.

27:23.616 --> 27:26.488
And it was that same walker
that bit me.

27:26.532 --> 27:29.187
And he --
he talked to me.

27:30.579 --> 27:32.451
Padre.

27:32.494 --> 27:33.582
But it wasn't
his voice.

27:33.626 --> 27:36.237
It was --
It didn't belong to him.

27:36.281 --> 27:38.239
It was this static.

27:38.283 --> 27:41.373
But it -- it told me

27:41.416 --> 27:43.070
to follow him to PADRE.

27:45.203 --> 27:46.595
And so I did,

27:46.639 --> 27:49.990
or that's what
I've been trying to do.

27:50.034 --> 27:56.693
And I made all these people
believe in me.

27:56.736 --> 27:59.260
I-I told them I knew
what I was doing,

27:59.304 --> 28:02.437
where I was going,
and I didn't.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.309
You know,
it was just a dream.

28:10.794 --> 28:12.665
You must've heard that voice
for a reason.

28:12.709 --> 28:14.623
No. Whatever it was,

28:14.667 --> 28:17.452
all these people died
because of me.

28:27.027 --> 28:29.987
And now that voice
is all Ican hear.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.467
Every time
I close my eyes.

28:35.775 --> 28:37.908
Every time I manage
to fall asleep.

28:43.261 --> 28:44.915
Were you...

28:44.958 --> 28:47.787
serious about what
you said before?

28:47.831 --> 28:50.355
About me coming with you
to that place

28:50.398 --> 28:51.617
you were trying
to take over?

28:55.273 --> 28:57.449
I'd like
to take you up on that.

28:57.492 --> 28:59.277
Why?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.105
Because something tells me
there's a reason

29:01.148 --> 29:04.325
I came across you
in that barn.

29:04.369 --> 29:07.328
I think maybe we can
help each other

29:07.372 --> 29:09.548
drown out what
we don't want to hear.

29:09.591 --> 29:12.072
Paul, I couldn't even
get you a stereo.

29:14.683 --> 29:16.294
We got one right here.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.209
Look, you got lucky.

29:21.081 --> 29:23.301
You need to stay
away from me.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.956
I can't let you get hurt
because of me.
I won't.

29:25.999 --> 29:29.176
Look, Arno will not stop
until I'm dead,

29:29.220 --> 29:31.135
and even if he doesn't
find us here,

29:31.178 --> 29:33.615
he will go to your house,
and he will hurt you.

29:33.659 --> 29:36.967
Which is why
we need to be ready for him.

29:38.185 --> 29:39.665
How?

29:42.146 --> 29:43.930
You trust me?

29:56.900 --> 30:00.294
If you're listening...

30:00.338 --> 30:02.209
if you can hear me,

30:02.253 --> 30:04.429
I'm sorry about the mishap
back there.

30:04.472 --> 30:06.170
She turned on me, too.

30:06.213 --> 30:08.781
That problem you got?

30:08.825 --> 30:10.609
I'm ready
to help you solve it.

30:10.652 --> 30:13.742
My house after dark.

30:42.249 --> 30:44.382
You don't have
to do this.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.688
The sooner I help you
take him out...

30:46.732 --> 30:49.561
the sooner you can get back
to your people,

30:49.604 --> 30:52.346
so you can do
what you need to do next,

30:52.390 --> 30:53.870
and stop
punishing yourself

30:53.913 --> 30:55.393
for something
that's not your fault.

30:55.436 --> 30:56.873
Look,
even if Arno's gone,

30:56.916 --> 30:59.614
this voice is not
gonna go away.

31:01.529 --> 31:03.749
Maybe it's not meant
to be silenced.

31:06.404 --> 31:10.234
But you said --I-I said we could
drown out the voices

31:10.277 --> 31:12.279
that we don'twant
to hear.

31:14.716 --> 31:19.547
Maybe you should keep listening
to the voice from your dream.

31:19.591 --> 31:21.419
Why?

31:21.462 --> 31:26.076
My old man...
he was one hell of a pianist.

31:26.119 --> 31:30.254
People used to call him
the Texas Gershwin.

31:30.297 --> 31:32.909
My older brother -- whew --
damn near just as good.

31:32.952 --> 31:36.260
So, when I started
taking lessons,

31:36.303 --> 31:38.915
I thought I could play
like them.

31:38.958 --> 31:41.091
But every time
my teacher would catch me,

31:41.134 --> 31:44.877
he would just smash my hands
with a yard stick.

31:44.921 --> 31:49.490
Made him so mad.

31:49.534 --> 31:52.189
Why?

31:52.232 --> 31:54.278
Because...

31:54.321 --> 31:57.455
nobody ever
makes great music

31:57.498 --> 31:59.805
imitating others.

31:59.848 --> 32:01.938
It's gotta come
from you.

32:04.853 --> 32:06.943
Maybe that's why
it didn't work out before.

32:08.857 --> 32:11.817
Because you thought
somebody else

32:11.860 --> 32:13.775
was trying
to tell youwhat to do.

32:16.387 --> 32:19.825
That voice,
maybe it's you.

32:19.868 --> 32:22.175
So, listen to it.

32:22.219 --> 32:25.048
'Cause if you don't...

32:25.091 --> 32:26.614
you might regret it.

32:31.141 --> 32:35.362
You owe it to yourself
and to anyone you want to help.

32:37.408 --> 32:39.453
Where are you?

32:39.497 --> 32:41.368
I know you're in there.

32:41.412 --> 32:42.804
They're here.

32:45.894 --> 32:47.461
Here.

32:47.505 --> 32:49.202
Put these in.

32:50.682 --> 32:52.597
It's gonna get loud.

33:01.910 --> 33:04.348
We know you're in there,
Alicia!

33:07.264 --> 33:09.005
Where are you?

33:11.224 --> 33:12.878
Come on out.

33:24.150 --> 33:26.065
Come on out, Alicia.

33:27.327 --> 33:30.287
Before you get
someone else hurt.

33:30.330 --> 33:32.071
Make sure she doesn't
sneak out the back.

33:56.443 --> 33:58.141
Fall back!

33:58.184 --> 33:59.316
Fall back!

34:01.361 --> 34:03.102
Shit. Shit.

34:30.608 --> 34:32.131
He's coming in
through the back!

34:59.811 --> 35:01.334
There are too many!

35:50.862 --> 35:52.429
Paul.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.271
Let me see.

36:12.144 --> 36:13.928
It's gonna be okay.

36:16.017 --> 36:17.280
Hold this.

36:17.323 --> 36:20.674
Where we're going,
there are medical supplies.

36:20.718 --> 36:22.198
It's too late.

36:22.241 --> 36:24.243
It's not.
We'll get out of here.

36:24.287 --> 36:26.202
Youwill.

36:28.334 --> 36:29.466
I'm not
leaving you here.

36:31.642 --> 36:34.340
You don't have a choice.

36:37.517 --> 36:39.693
You got here because of me.
Okay?

36:39.737 --> 36:43.436
Because I said I'd take you
somewhere safe.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.310
I would have followed you
wherever that may have been.

36:47.353 --> 36:49.268
So will they.

36:49.312 --> 36:50.313
Who?

36:50.356 --> 36:52.271
Ah, your friends.

36:52.315 --> 36:54.621
Your people.

36:54.665 --> 36:58.277
That's what your dream
was trying to tell you.

36:58.321 --> 36:59.713
They're the ones
you're meant to lead.

37:01.585 --> 37:03.108
Come on, Paul.

37:03.151 --> 37:04.588
Come on.
We have to go.

37:04.631 --> 37:07.417
You just need

37:07.460 --> 37:09.462
to believe
in what you're capable of.

37:11.943 --> 37:15.294
I doubted someone
I cared about.

37:15.338 --> 37:17.905
I won't make that same mistake
again with you.

37:24.695 --> 37:26.914
Go, Alicia.

37:30.004 --> 37:31.919
I won't make it
past him.

37:37.534 --> 37:38.926
You will...

37:38.970 --> 37:40.841
if they can't hear you.

37:45.368 --> 37:47.326
Open up!

37:47.370 --> 37:50.111
You know you can't stay
in there forever.

37:50.155 --> 37:51.983
Open up!

39:14.718 --> 39:16.284
You again?

39:23.030 --> 39:26.556
Are you okay?

39:26.599 --> 39:28.427
Masked
I will be.

39:38.350 --> 39:40.004
If you can help me...

39:43.834 --> 39:45.226
...maybe I can help you.

40:18.521 --> 40:20.087
Hey!

40:20.131 --> 40:23.830
Padre...

40:23.874 --> 40:26.267
Hey!

40:29.488 --> 40:30.489
Woman's voice: Padre.

40:30.533 --> 40:32.535
Follow me.

40:34.537 --> 40:36.277
Hey.

40:42.327 --> 40:43.284
Padre.

40:48.420 --> 40:49.421
Follow me.

41:00.432 --> 41:02.913
Alicia.

41:02.956 --> 41:06.525
Alicia.

41:06.569 --> 41:07.700
Wake up.

41:11.965 --> 41:13.140
Morgan.

41:15.447 --> 41:17.362
It's okay.

41:17.405 --> 41:19.712
Hey, hey.

41:19.756 --> 41:22.106
You're alright.

41:22.149 --> 41:24.064
Hey.

41:28.852 --> 41:30.375
How long have
I been out?

41:30.418 --> 41:32.116
You showed up here
last night,

41:32.159 --> 41:36.337
but you collapsed
before we could get you inside.

41:36.381 --> 41:37.425
Here.

41:42.126 --> 41:45.042
Gotta keep
your fever down.

41:48.741 --> 41:50.308
Where is she?

41:50.351 --> 41:51.614
Who?

41:51.657 --> 41:52.745
The girl.
What girl?

41:52.789 --> 41:54.181
The one who
brought me here.

41:54.225 --> 41:56.096
You were alone
when we found you.

41:59.796 --> 42:02.102
What is it?

42:02.146 --> 42:05.279
Alicia...
are you alright?

42:10.023 --> 42:13.287
How did it go
with Arno?

42:13.331 --> 42:15.594
You convince him
to come and join us?

42:15.638 --> 42:17.553
I'm sorry.

42:22.862 --> 42:24.211
I know we don't
have enough people

42:24.255 --> 42:27.780
to take on Strand
without them.

42:27.824 --> 42:29.477
Then we find
another way.

42:29.521 --> 42:32.045
I think
I already have one.

42:32.089 --> 42:34.395
Just tell me
what this is about.

42:34.439 --> 42:36.180
There might be a way
to get the army we need.

42:36.223 --> 42:37.790
How?

42:39.792 --> 42:41.272
Promise me
you won't try to stop me.

42:41.315 --> 42:42.795
Hey, you have yet to tell me
why you thought

42:42.839 --> 42:44.623
that walker
was gonna lead us to PADRE.

42:44.667 --> 42:46.407
Even after
I followed along.

42:46.451 --> 42:47.974
So I don't think
it's too much to expect

42:48.018 --> 42:52.022
a straight answer
to a straight question.

42:52.065 --> 42:54.111
What is this
all about?

43:00.204 --> 43:02.641
I had a dream.

43:02.685 --> 43:06.471
When I was in the bunker,
after I cut it off.

43:06.514 --> 43:09.561
You had a dream.

43:09.605 --> 43:11.868
When my fever was at its worst,
there was this voice,

43:11.911 --> 43:13.260
and I thought
it was telling me

43:13.304 --> 43:14.871
the walker would
lead us there.

43:14.914 --> 43:17.308
Thought it was coming
from PADRE.

43:17.351 --> 43:18.657
But it was coming
from where?

43:18.701 --> 43:20.224
Me.

43:20.267 --> 43:24.141
Look,
my mom had her dream.

43:24.184 --> 43:27.884
Nick had his.
You have yours.

43:27.927 --> 43:30.147
I've always had such
strong voices around me.

43:30.190 --> 43:32.715
I've never stopped
to really listen to mine.

43:34.934 --> 43:37.633
But I am now.

43:37.676 --> 43:40.026
So, where will you go?

43:40.070 --> 43:41.419
The bunker.

43:41.462 --> 43:43.029
There's a working transmitter
down there

43:43.073 --> 43:44.335
and I need it
to reach people.

43:44.378 --> 43:46.293
'Cause that walker,

43:46.337 --> 43:48.861
I thought it would
lead us to PADRE,

43:48.905 --> 43:53.866
but I was wrong, because
I don't think PADRE even exists.

43:53.910 --> 43:55.912
But there are a lot of people
out there like me

43:55.955 --> 43:57.043
who are looking for it,

43:57.087 --> 43:58.741
or looking
for a place like it.

43:58.784 --> 44:00.743
Hey, you can't lead people
to a place that doesn't exist.

44:00.786 --> 44:03.267
I know.
But I can lead them to us.

44:03.310 --> 44:04.964
To us? Like...

44:07.619 --> 44:09.360
...you're gonna
become PADRE?

44:09.403 --> 44:11.710
I'm going to give them
what they want.

44:11.754 --> 44:13.277
A safe place to live,

44:13.320 --> 44:14.757
and that's how
we get our army.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.282
That's how we take the Tower
from Strand.

44:19.762 --> 44:21.677
I should come
with you.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.417
No, I need you
to stay here.

44:23.461 --> 44:28.292
Because when I come back,
that's when we make our move.

44:28.335 --> 44:30.947
Then we will be ready
for when you get back.

44:30.990 --> 44:33.689
But you should
rest first.

44:36.996 --> 44:38.476
I can't.

44:39.956 --> 44:40.913
Just be ready.

45:01.934 --> 45:03.980
Whoa!

45:04.023 --> 45:07.331
Sage, why are we stopping?
Look at me.

45:07.374 --> 45:09.072
My hand -- it could kill me
if we don't treat it.

45:09.115 --> 45:11.857
We don't have time.

45:11.901 --> 45:14.164
Arno?

45:14.207 --> 45:16.035
Look!

45:28.831 --> 45:31.181
Herd musta fell in.

45:36.273 --> 45:38.449
Probably been stewing down there
for months.

45:38.492 --> 45:41.234
How many do you
think there are?

45:41.278 --> 45:43.193
Too many.

45:43.236 --> 45:46.936
If one of them gets out,
none of us are going anywhere.

45:46.979 --> 45:50.374
We're gonna take the Tower
for ourselves.

45:54.857 --> 45:56.989
One of Morgan's.

45:57.033 --> 45:58.425
If today proved anything,

45:58.469 --> 46:00.123
it's that we need to
protect this place.

46:00.166 --> 46:01.602
There are other ways.

46:01.646 --> 46:03.300
I got ya.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.389
Do you really think you're
ready to be a ranger?

46:05.432 --> 46:08.392
I'll go with you.

46:12.265 --> 46:13.963
You're a monster.No!

46:15.878 --> 46:19.098
Ali, what are you doing?
Ali?!

46:28.673 --> 46:30.414
This is a story about Alicia

46:30.457 --> 46:32.633
coming into her own
as a leader.

46:32.677 --> 46:33.678
Follow me.

46:33.721 --> 46:34.461
It goes from a story

46:34.505 --> 46:35.636
where she thought she had

46:35.680 --> 46:37.334
to follow someone else

46:37.377 --> 46:40.250
and now it's about other people
needing to follow her.

46:42.730 --> 46:45.472
Alicia is still not
physically well.

46:45.516 --> 46:46.822
She's got fevers.

46:46.865 --> 46:49.302
You can tell
that she's disoriented.

46:49.346 --> 46:52.392
We really wanted that feeling
of disorientation

46:52.436 --> 46:54.264
to filter down to the audience

46:54.307 --> 46:57.049
and understand what it was like
to suddenly wake up

46:57.093 --> 47:00.096
in this strange house
with music blasting

47:00.139 --> 47:02.533
and a walker that's wandered
in the front door

47:02.576 --> 47:04.317
and just wondering,
"Is this real?

47:04.361 --> 47:06.711
Is this a nightmare?
Is this something in between?"

47:06.754 --> 47:07.625
Ah!

47:14.719 --> 47:16.939
Alicia broke Paul's stereo

47:16.982 --> 47:19.332
and he wants her help
restoring that.

47:19.376 --> 47:22.118
We see that's a very
significant thing for him.

47:22.161 --> 47:23.684
What did you do?!

47:27.558 --> 47:31.954
It was critically important
that we find an actor who's deaf

47:31.997 --> 47:34.565
that could really bring a sense
of authenticity.

47:34.608 --> 47:36.697
Easy.
Didn't you hear me?

47:36.741 --> 47:38.743
I haven't heard a goddamn
thing in months.

47:38.786 --> 47:41.398
Warren is a singer
and a musician himself.

47:41.441 --> 47:42.747
You're going to have
to speak a lot slower

47:42.790 --> 47:44.314
if you expect me
to read your lips.

47:44.357 --> 47:45.968
We found him
and what he brought

47:46.011 --> 47:48.361
to the performance
incredibly inspiring

47:48.405 --> 47:50.407
and we -- we think
it turned out really well.

47:50.450 --> 47:53.932
Just 'cause
you can't hearmusic

47:53.976 --> 47:55.934
don't mean you can't
feelit.

48:03.855 --> 48:05.944
Hide me.

48:05.988 --> 48:08.381
Paul gets a pretty good read
on Arno

48:08.425 --> 48:11.950
when he comes to the door
with a cart full of walkers.

48:11.994 --> 48:14.910
Paul knows that Alicia is just
someone who's in some trouble.

48:16.128 --> 48:19.349
She has a habit
of getting people hurt.

48:19.392 --> 48:20.959
What do you want
with her?

48:21.003 --> 48:23.135
He's a good person.Appreciate your time.

48:23.179 --> 48:25.224
He's not going to hand her
over to someone

48:25.268 --> 48:27.139
who clearly doesn't have
good intentions for her.

48:28.793 --> 48:29.968
It is true, what he said,

48:30.012 --> 48:31.448
about you
getting folks hurt?

48:31.491 --> 48:33.972
Alicia absolutely believes
what Arno's saying.

48:34.016 --> 48:37.149
He's articulating the voice
that's in her mind.

48:37.193 --> 48:40.848
He wants Alicia to be confronted
because of what he believes

48:40.892 --> 48:42.850
are bad decisions she made,

48:42.894 --> 48:45.331
which were based on this dream
that she had

48:45.375 --> 48:46.985
following the Senator walker,

48:47.029 --> 48:48.987
and it had really dire
consequences.

48:49.031 --> 48:50.467
PADRE.

48:50.510 --> 48:51.990
He wants Alicia to see just

48:52.034 --> 48:54.166
what a poor leadership
decision that was.

48:54.210 --> 48:56.038
You should put them
to rest.

48:56.081 --> 48:57.996
It'd be way more fun

48:58.040 --> 49:00.216
to let them punish you
for what you did.

49:00.259 --> 49:02.131
Wait!

49:02.174 --> 49:03.393
No! Wait.

49:03.436 --> 49:04.960
Aah!

49:07.179 --> 49:08.702
Get down!

49:08.746 --> 49:09.834
Paul has lost his hearing,

49:09.877 --> 49:12.184
but is still able
to help Alicia.

49:12.228 --> 49:15.231
Alicia's lost her arm,
lost her faith in herself,

49:15.274 --> 49:17.668
but it's still using
those disadvantages,

49:17.711 --> 49:20.758
finding a way to work together
to make something incredible.

49:27.330 --> 49:28.940
Beethoven, probably

49:28.984 --> 49:31.029
the most famous deaf musician
that ever lived.

49:31.073 --> 49:34.119
"Ode to Joy" is just this
incredible piece of music

49:34.163 --> 49:37.601
that Beethoven composed entirely
after he'd lost his hearing.

49:37.644 --> 49:39.037
The sooner I help you
take them out,

49:39.081 --> 49:40.908
the sooner you can get
back to your people.

49:40.952 --> 49:42.954
There's a lot going on
in the sequence,

49:42.998 --> 49:46.784
but, really, at the heart of it,
it's about Alicia and Paul,

49:46.827 --> 49:49.091
these two wounded characters,

49:49.134 --> 49:51.702
helping each other navigate
this incredible gauntlet

49:51.745 --> 49:54.792
of Arno and his groupCome on out!

49:54.835 --> 49:56.272
by using Beethoven,

49:56.315 --> 49:57.882
which was kind of the thing
that brought

49:57.925 --> 50:01.277
Alicia and Paul together
in the first place.

50:02.321 --> 50:03.844
While Arno and the guys

50:03.888 --> 50:07.457
are being consumed
by this blaring music,

50:07.500 --> 50:13.071
that gives Alicia the window
she needs to escape.

50:13.115 --> 50:16.031
Paul grabbing the bagpipes
is the fulfillment

50:16.074 --> 50:18.685
of the thing that his wife,
Rowan, didn't get to do

50:18.729 --> 50:22.080
and it's also his final
good deed for Alicia,

50:22.124 --> 50:23.081
so that she can escape.

50:23.125 --> 50:24.430
Paul knows,

50:24.474 --> 50:25.475
when he takes that action,

50:25.518 --> 50:26.606
it's probably going to mean

50:26.650 --> 50:27.738
the end of his own life.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.835
The reason Alicia's dream
has changed

50:37.878 --> 50:40.490
is because Paul has helped
her see it in a new way.

50:40.533 --> 50:44.494
Paul has forced Alicia
to listen to her own voice

50:44.537 --> 50:46.191
in a way that she hasn't before.

50:46.235 --> 50:49.412
What that is, is she needs to be
the person who's followed.

50:51.501 --> 50:52.241
You're alright.

50:52.284 --> 50:54.069
Morgan has goals,

50:54.112 --> 50:55.461
when it comes to Alicia.

50:55.505 --> 50:57.681
He sees her as a leader
and they're going

50:57.724 --> 51:00.684
to need each other
to take Strand's tower.

51:00.727 --> 51:02.120
How did it go
with Arno?

51:02.164 --> 51:04.296
You convince him
to come and join us?

51:04.340 --> 51:07.125
I'm sorry.

51:07.169 --> 51:08.431
I know we don't have
enough people

51:08.474 --> 51:10.694
to take on Strand
without them.

51:10.737 --> 51:12.435
Then we find
another way.

51:12.478 --> 51:13.914
I think I already
have one.

51:13.958 --> 51:16.526
Even though Alicia's instincts
didn't bear out,

51:16.569 --> 51:19.311
Morgan realizes he's going
to have to trust her.

51:19.355 --> 51:21.052
I don't think PADRE
even exists.

51:23.010 --> 51:24.969
But there are a lot
of people out there like me

51:25.012 --> 51:27.406
who are looking
for a place like it.

51:27.450 --> 51:29.539
Going to give them
what they want --

51:29.582 --> 51:31.280
a safe place to live.

51:31.323 --> 51:32.455
And that's how
we get our army,

51:32.498 --> 51:35.936
that's how we take
the tower from Strand.

51:35.980 --> 51:37.286
When I come back,

51:37.329 --> 51:38.678
that's when we make
our move.

51:47.557 --> 51:50.516
The crater was a very
important idea to us.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.866
We sort of thought of it
as the ground zero

51:52.910 --> 51:55.826
for the most dangerous walkers
that were created

51:55.869 --> 51:59.003
out of the bomb that went off
at the end of Season 6.

51:59.046 --> 52:01.005
We know that these walkers
are going

52:01.048 --> 52:04.704
to factor in very heavily
into the story going forward.

52:04.748 --> 52:06.358
You'll have to keep watching
to see how,

52:06.402 --> 52:10.145
but this is a particularly
dangerous breed of walker

52:10.188 --> 52:11.450
and there's a lot of them.
