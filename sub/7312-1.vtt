WEBVTT

00:03.043 --> 00:05.130
What's an NCIS agent
doing so far from home?

00:05.173 --> 00:06.130
I'm teaching a class

00:06.173 --> 00:07.739
on the forensics
of cold cases.

00:07.782 --> 00:09.434
We're using the murder of a man

00:09.478 --> 00:11.130
named Pedro Hernandez
as a case study.

00:11.173 --> 00:13.565
I need to exhume the body
of Pedro Hernandez.

00:13.608 --> 00:15.608
The body of a drug dealer
from 20 years ago?

00:15.652 --> 00:16.826
I don't think anyone will mind.

00:16.869 --> 00:18.217
DUCKY:
I have it.

00:18.260 --> 00:19.652
ABBY:
The evidence in my report

00:19.695 --> 00:23.086
says that you killed
Pedro Hernandez.

00:23.130 --> 00:26.217
I mean, I know he killed
your wife and your daughter.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.913
Tell me what your
patriot Bell is up to.

00:27.956 --> 00:29.260
He's been accumulating

00:29.304 --> 00:31.043
information on
Special Agent Gibbs.

00:31.086 --> 00:33.652
Where is he?Last I heard he was headed
back down to Mexico.

00:33.695 --> 00:35.260
I need you to get a message
to Mike for me.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.565
The message is: Rule number 44.

00:37.608 --> 00:39.652
[whispers]:
Oh, Mike.

00:39.695 --> 00:40.652
That ain't Franks.

00:40.695 --> 00:41.478
Who is it?

00:41.521 --> 00:43.086
Colonel Merton Bell.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.130
Colonel Bell wanted to prove
he was a better man than you.

00:45.173 --> 00:48.043
He and his men made
for a useful ally,

00:48.086 --> 00:50.434
but they were a means to an end.

00:50.478 --> 00:52.652
Then you might as well put
a bullet in my head right now,

00:52.695 --> 00:54.217
because you're not
gonna get anything.

00:54.260 --> 00:57.130
Well, hermano,
does he have your
precious report?

00:57.173 --> 00:58.304
No.

00:58.347 --> 00:59.739
Brother and sister.

00:59.782 --> 01:01.304
But I never lost
a night's sleep

01:01.347 --> 01:02.913
over your father.

01:02.956 --> 01:05.043
This is the bullet
that should end you.

01:05.086 --> 01:07.000
Do you think I want that?

01:12.869 --> 01:14.869
What's your assignment here?Director's
orders.

01:14.913 --> 01:15.869
Observe and report.

01:15.913 --> 01:17.478
If I must...

01:17.521 --> 01:19.043
I promise to personally

01:19.086 --> 01:20.304
visit Pennsylvania

01:20.347 --> 01:21.826
and shoot your father
in the head...

01:21.869 --> 01:23.086
[echoes]:
in the head...

01:30.739 --> 01:32.652
[door opens]

01:37.956 --> 01:39.826
Can I help you?

01:41.260 --> 01:43.130
Yes, Mr. Gibbs.

01:43.173 --> 01:45.000
I think you can.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.652
Now, ma'am...

01:51.695 --> 01:53.652
you need to go.

01:53.695 --> 01:57.130
But we have so much
to talk about.

01:57.173 --> 01:59.826
From what I hear,

01:59.869 --> 02:02.000
you didn't come to talk.

02:03.565 --> 02:04.695
[pumps shotgun]

02:04.739 --> 02:06.000
[laughs]

02:07.434 --> 02:09.652
You are just like your son.

02:09.695 --> 02:11.347
No, ma'am.

02:11.391 --> 02:13.347
He's just like me.

02:13.391 --> 02:16.695
[gunshot strikes window,
excited chatter outside]

02:16.739 --> 02:19.130
How confident are you...

02:19.173 --> 02:20.913
Mr. Gibbs?

02:20.956 --> 02:23.521
I was raised on a farm.

02:23.565 --> 02:26.391
Used to play chicken
in my daddy's truck

02:26.434 --> 02:28.347
every Saturday night.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.695
This ain't much different.

02:35.043 --> 02:37.608
[dog barking in distance]

02:44.956 --> 02:46.521
[door closes]

02:46.565 --> 02:48.782
MAN:
Come on, come on! Mátalo.

02:48.826 --> 02:49.826
Ahora.

02:49.869 --> 02:52.260
[excited chatter continues]

03:04.347 --> 03:05.695
[gunfire stops]

03:13.173 --> 03:15.260
[exhales]

03:15.304 --> 03:17.826
Find him.

03:17.869 --> 03:20.000
[car alarms blaring,
excited chatter outside]

03:20.043 --> 03:22.434
[siren approaching]

03:22.478 --> 03:25.130
Señora, la policía.

03:25.173 --> 03:27.434
He is gone.

04:01.043 --> 04:05.000
[dog barking in distance,
traffic passing quietly]

04:10.217 --> 04:11.347
[quiet clatter nearby]

04:15.782 --> 04:18.043
I thought we'd try
some ham today.

04:18.086 --> 04:20.347
I hope those eggs

04:20.391 --> 04:22.434
aren't overcooked.

04:22.478 --> 04:26.086
You don't have to make breakfast
for me every day, Dad.

04:26.130 --> 04:28.913
Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

04:28.956 --> 04:30.434
Gets your batteries charged.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.652
Mm-hmm.

04:31.695 --> 04:33.565
Mom used to say that.

04:33.608 --> 04:35.478
Uh-huh.

04:35.521 --> 04:36.826
[sighs]

04:36.869 --> 04:39.478
Thought I'd do
some errands today.

04:39.521 --> 04:41.304
Fix that faucet upstairs.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.826
Anything you need?

04:43.869 --> 04:45.956
No. Wish you'd take

04:46.000 --> 04:48.173
the agents with you.

04:48.217 --> 04:50.304
Do I really need those guys?

04:50.347 --> 04:52.869
They're good men, Dad.

04:52.913 --> 04:55.521
I've been living in this house
under lock and key

04:55.565 --> 04:57.000
for months now.

04:57.043 --> 04:59.260
They've never done a damn thing.

05:00.391 --> 05:02.304
You're lucky you're not dead.

05:02.347 --> 05:06.217
I'm lucky there was a storm
cellar I could hide out in.

05:12.434 --> 05:15.043
Son...

05:15.086 --> 05:17.043
I want to go home.

05:17.086 --> 05:18.652
It's time.

05:18.695 --> 05:21.521
When it's safe.

05:27.565 --> 05:31.434
[indistinct chatter over video]

05:35.478 --> 05:37.434
[gunshots, shouting, screaming]

05:37.478 --> 05:40.521
[tires screech]

05:40.565 --> 05:42.130
[gunshots continue]

05:50.869 --> 05:53.043
Watching it again is
not gonna change anything.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.521
It was a trap.

05:54.565 --> 05:55.695
Yep.

05:55.739 --> 05:56.739
Now look.

05:56.782 --> 05:58.434
Rivera gives the signal.[gunshot]

05:58.478 --> 05:59.608
All hell breaks loose.

05:59.652 --> 06:01.086
He knew we were following him.

06:01.130 --> 06:02.173
We walked right into it.

06:02.217 --> 06:04.434
Let it go, DiNozzo.

06:04.478 --> 06:06.956
[gunfire, people shouting,
screaming]

06:07.000 --> 06:08.086
Any word from Franks?

06:08.130 --> 06:09.956
Sorry, boss.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.782
Observe and report.

06:11.826 --> 06:13.695
Director's orders.

06:13.739 --> 06:16.130
It's hard to observe
when you're being shot at.

06:16.173 --> 06:18.000
Think Vance is still
angry with me?

06:18.043 --> 06:19.260
VANCE: What do
youthink?

06:20.695 --> 06:22.304
Morning, sir.

06:22.347 --> 06:24.695
We were just discussing
our continued effort

06:24.739 --> 06:26.739
to locate Paloma Reynosa.

06:26.782 --> 06:28.347
And?

06:28.391 --> 06:30.695
How about those
Washington Nationals, sir?

06:30.739 --> 06:33.086
I just got off
the phone with SECNAV.

06:33.130 --> 06:36.521
He wants to know why NCIS
can't successfully orchestrate

06:36.565 --> 06:39.086
a manhunt for
one female drug dealer.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.043
It's Mexico.

06:41.086 --> 06:43.347
What's to say she hasn't
already crossed the border?

06:43.391 --> 06:45.521
My gut.
The DEA wants

06:45.565 --> 06:47.521
to step in.
However,

06:47.565 --> 06:49.217
I'd like to save face.

06:49.260 --> 06:52.043
And despite
Señor Rivera's family ties,

06:52.086 --> 06:53.217
the Mexican
government has opted

06:53.260 --> 06:54.869
to keep him
in a position of authority.

06:54.913 --> 06:56.826
GIBBS:
The government's got
their hands full these days.

06:56.869 --> 06:59.043
I guess the Reynosas have
paid off the right people.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.695
Yeah, or killed them.

07:00.739 --> 07:02.391
Status report.

07:02.434 --> 07:04.826
Ziva's following
a lead in Miami,

07:04.869 --> 07:06.260
a Cuban tie-in.

07:06.304 --> 07:07.652
Agent McGee.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.043
At the Canadian border.

07:09.086 --> 07:11.260
VANCE: This is starting
to impact our workload.

07:11.304 --> 07:14.000
Paloma could be anywhere
in the world by now.

07:14.043 --> 07:17.000
Yeah, Leon, or she could
be across the street.

07:18.826 --> 07:20.565
Dead reservist.
Check it.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.913
Saddle up, DiNozzo.

07:23.956 --> 07:25.434
We're not going
to Arizona, are we?

07:25.478 --> 07:28.043
West Virginia.

07:28.086 --> 07:29.913
JIMMY:
Spectacular.

07:29.956 --> 07:31.000
Are those the
Blue Ridge Mountains?

07:31.043 --> 07:32.826
Shenandoah River's not far.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.434
Thank God I'm
a country lad!

07:35.478 --> 07:37.391
"Country boy," Ducky.

07:37.434 --> 07:39.086
TONY:
For an emergency landing,

07:39.130 --> 07:41.391
this helicopter's
surprisingly intact.

07:41.434 --> 07:42.652
Landing's not
what killed them.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.521
Them? As in more
than one them?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.304
Captain John McMahon,
owned and piloted

07:46.347 --> 07:47.391
the charter service.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.652
Around 2:00 a.m.

07:48.695 --> 07:50.869
this morning, he was
in the middle of a job

07:50.913 --> 07:52.782
when he, uh, reported
mechanical trouble.

07:52.826 --> 07:54.869
Then he made a Mayday
and set her down here.

07:54.913 --> 07:57.000
That was the last
anybody heard from him.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.608
Based on the blood flow pattern,
the real trouble wasn't midair.

07:59.652 --> 08:03.000
The captain was shot
here on the ground.

08:03.043 --> 08:05.869
Got another gunshot wound
over here, Doctor.

08:05.913 --> 08:09.347
There's a nine-millimeter
casing in the grass, boss.

08:09.391 --> 08:11.695
.45 next to the pilot.

08:11.739 --> 08:13.043
Wait, they
shot each other?

08:13.086 --> 08:15.130
You got a passenger manifest?No, sir.

08:15.173 --> 08:16.913
No route
logged, either.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.739
TONY:
Middle of the night, somebody
hired this guy on the QT.

08:19.782 --> 08:21.869
GIBBS:
So, after the Mayday,

08:21.913 --> 08:24.565
the passenger couldn't risk
talking to the police,

08:24.608 --> 08:25.869
so he shot McMahon.

08:25.913 --> 08:27.478
He didn't expect him
to shoot back.

08:27.521 --> 08:29.521
Wait a minute,
where are the guns?

08:29.565 --> 08:31.260
Holster's empty.

08:35.043 --> 08:36.347
Eye in the sky.

08:36.391 --> 08:37.869
Record his flights.

08:37.913 --> 08:40.347
Must've had more than
a few bad customers.

08:40.391 --> 08:41.478
[beep]

08:45.086 --> 08:46.130
That's her.

08:46.173 --> 08:48.043
Doc, got a time a death?

08:48.086 --> 08:51.478
Approximately... nine hours ago.

08:51.521 --> 08:52.695
TONY:
Hell of a lead time.

08:52.739 --> 08:54.217
DiNozzo, local
airports on alert.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.652
Call Vance.

08:55.695 --> 08:57.347
Tell him we need agents
at the state border.

08:57.391 --> 08:59.956
DUCKY: Where do you figure
Ms. Reynosa's headed, Jethro?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.086
I don't know, Duck.

09:01.130 --> 09:03.521
But I'd sure like
to get there first.

09:09.739 --> 09:11.782
Well, you know, West Virginia
has five bordering states, boss.

09:11.826 --> 09:13.521
Giving out geography lessons
now, are you, DiNozzo?

09:13.565 --> 09:15.695
I'm just saying that's
a lot of land to cover.

09:15.739 --> 09:17.217
Get Ziva back from
Miami; tell McGee

09:17.260 --> 09:19.217
the chopper was heading
north when it went down.

09:19.260 --> 09:21.000
North as
in Canada?

09:21.043 --> 09:23.217
Yeah, maybe.

09:23.260 --> 09:24.739
[horse neighs]

09:24.782 --> 09:25.695
That horse likes you.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.391
This isn't funny, Tony.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.956
Oh, poor McMountie.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.173
Hey, so have you seen any, like,
moose and stuff up there?

09:32.217 --> 09:33.739
Hey, uh, where's your buddy,

09:33.782 --> 09:34.826
Claude?

09:34.869 --> 09:36.217
Isn't that your
friendly St. Bernard

09:36.260 --> 09:38.043
with the little barrel
of whiskey under his chin?

09:38.086 --> 09:39.869
Look, I've been up here
playing Dudley Do-Right

09:39.913 --> 09:41.173
for two weeks, okay?

09:41.217 --> 09:43.521
It's September,
and there's snow on the ground.

09:43.565 --> 09:45.869
Would you at least give me
a little compassion here?[mock sob]

09:45.913 --> 09:47.521
And what would that be for, huh?

09:47.565 --> 09:49.217
Did you forget to take off your
toque when you entered a room?

09:49.260 --> 09:51.173
You're gonna get
in trouble up there--

09:51.217 --> 09:52.434
hanging with
the blue-necks,

09:52.478 --> 09:54.173
throwing back a
two-four of pale ale...

09:54.217 --> 09:56.782
I've actually been working,
unlike certain people.

09:56.826 --> 09:58.565
Certain people here

09:58.608 --> 09:59.695
are working, McGee.

09:59.739 --> 10:00.782
Uh, of course, boss.

10:00.826 --> 10:02.391
Paloma Reynosa was in a chopper

10:02.434 --> 10:04.217
headed up the coast--
any idea why?

10:04.260 --> 10:06.043
Well, DEA and Mounties
narc division

10:06.086 --> 10:07.739
shut down a border
exchange yesterday.

10:07.782 --> 10:10.565
The product was from Mexico
and had potential ties

10:10.608 --> 10:12.304
to the Reynosa cartel.

10:12.347 --> 10:15.434
So Paloma could've been
headed there to seal the deal?

10:15.478 --> 10:17.478
If the copter hadn't gone down,
we might've gotten her.

10:17.521 --> 10:19.000
[horse whinnies, McGee groans]

10:19.043 --> 10:21.260
Boss, can I please come home?

10:21.304 --> 10:23.782
Nice horse, Tim.

10:23.826 --> 10:24.913
[horse neighing]

10:24.956 --> 10:27.478
Boss?

10:27.521 --> 10:30.652
Mr. Palmer, did you
ever visit the paradise

10:30.695 --> 10:32.217
that is Turks
and Caicos?

10:32.260 --> 10:34.913
PALMER:
No, but I did drive down
to the Florida Keys once,

10:34.956 --> 10:37.217
and I had the most delicious

10:37.260 --> 10:40.304
key lime pie at this little
shack right there on U.S. 1.

10:40.347 --> 10:41.608
I swear, the meringue

10:41.652 --> 10:44.217
had the appearance
of nimbus clouds.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.608
And...

10:47.347 --> 10:49.000
I'm sorry.
Uh, you were saying?

10:49.043 --> 10:52.043
Well, as a boy, my parents
used to refer to the region

10:52.086 --> 10:53.913
as the British West Indies.

10:53.956 --> 10:55.739
But never
in my life

10:55.782 --> 10:59.913
have I encountered insects
as unique to a locale as there.

10:59.956 --> 11:01.217
Uh, so you are
reminiscing

11:01.260 --> 11:03.478
based on the bug bites
on Estaban Lopez.

11:03.521 --> 11:05.695
Reynosa's friend here
had no idea

11:05.739 --> 11:08.391
what he was into,
traveling with her.

11:08.434 --> 11:11.869
His dermis is a veritable road
map of entomological reactions,

11:11.913 --> 11:16.347
and that, combined with the
contents of his stomach...

11:16.391 --> 11:19.956
I am sure we can ascertain
their various destinations.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.913
So you can actually tell
the difference

11:21.956 --> 11:23.130
between these bug bites?

11:23.173 --> 11:24.695
Of course, Mr. Palmer.

11:24.739 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, the Everglades are

11:28.043 --> 11:31.565
home to 43 species
of mosquito alone.

11:31.608 --> 11:35.826
Yeah, and don't get me started
on South Carolina's velvet ant.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.956
Hmm.
Now, then, I'll
run the gut

11:38.000 --> 11:40.608
while you get that up
to Abby for analysis.

11:40.652 --> 11:43.521
Yes, perhaps
our friend Estaban here

11:43.565 --> 11:46.478
can not only help us find
his previous employer,

11:46.521 --> 11:50.086
he can tell us
where she's been.

11:51.956 --> 11:52.956
[computer chimes]

11:56.478 --> 11:58.217
[sighs]

11:58.260 --> 11:59.695
Definitely not now, Dad.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.043
Hello, Tony.

12:03.086 --> 12:04.304
I'm back.

12:04.347 --> 12:06.826
Well, hello,
Little Miss Sunshine State,

12:06.869 --> 12:08.217
and don't you look balmy?

12:08.260 --> 12:10.000
I do not know what
"balmy" means,

12:10.043 --> 12:12.608
but I will assume
it is not good.

12:12.652 --> 12:15.608
Well, just because I was
alone manning the fort,

12:15.652 --> 12:16.956
handling Gibbs solo

12:17.000 --> 12:18.869
while you've been strolling
around South Beach,

12:18.913 --> 12:20.739
dancing to the rhythm
of the night...

12:20.782 --> 12:23.608
[laughing]:
...why would I feel the need
to say anything negative?

12:23.652 --> 12:25.434
Because you are you.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.043
Besides, I was working
the entire time.

12:27.086 --> 12:28.521
[scoffs]
Ha.

12:28.565 --> 12:29.565
Ha, what?

12:29.608 --> 12:31.739
Working.

12:31.782 --> 12:33.739
Are those tan lines?

12:33.782 --> 12:36.043
Where do you think
you're looking?

12:36.086 --> 12:37.217
Does it even matter?

12:37.260 --> 12:38.913
Well, actually, yes, it does,

12:38.956 --> 12:42.782
and I can assure you
I do not have any tan lines.

12:42.826 --> 12:46.043
Oh, so you did lay in the sun?

12:46.086 --> 12:48.608
Yes, I did, actually, this
morning before my flight,

12:48.652 --> 12:50.043
and I came up with something

12:50.086 --> 12:52.565
case-related
prior to my departure.[sniffing]

12:52.608 --> 12:55.304
Hmm, you smell like
ocean and shea butter.

12:55.347 --> 12:58.043
A local Dade County
informant said

12:58.086 --> 13:01.043
that a Mexican drug shipment
recently came in by boat--

13:01.086 --> 13:03.217
a deal closed
by the Reynosa family--

13:03.260 --> 13:06.652
and Alejandro Rivera even
paid a political visit

13:06.695 --> 13:07.695
to the mayor.

13:07.739 --> 13:09.086
Wonder Twins
have been busy.

13:09.130 --> 13:11.217
The Wonder who?

13:11.260 --> 13:13.217
Wonder Twins--
TV superheroes.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.521
They're brother and sister.

13:14.565 --> 13:16.130
When they touch their
rings, they activate--

13:16.173 --> 13:18.043
form of a waterfall,
shape of a dinosaur,

13:18.086 --> 13:19.173
that kind of thing.

13:19.217 --> 13:22.739
Okay, what do you think
they are up to?

13:22.782 --> 13:25.782
Maybe they're following through
on business before pleasure.

13:25.826 --> 13:29.521
Is killing Gibbs' father
business or pleasure?

13:30.652 --> 13:32.956
Both.

13:40.260 --> 13:41.434
[firewood clattering]

13:41.478 --> 13:42.521
Want some help?

13:44.434 --> 13:46.782
You all right?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.217
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.217
Why?

13:49.260 --> 13:50.826
Your head's not here.

13:52.739 --> 13:57.565
I saw the agents checking
their weapons a while back.

13:57.608 --> 13:59.478
Figured something was up.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.652
Paloma's back.

14:03.695 --> 14:06.304
She surfaced
about 300 miles away.

14:06.347 --> 14:09.000
Got no sense
where she's headed yet.

14:09.043 --> 14:10.956
Coming here, I imagine.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.913
Your instincts were right.

14:14.956 --> 14:17.086
Sorry I doubted you.

14:17.130 --> 14:19.304
Been rough on everybody, Dad.

14:19.347 --> 14:22.260
When this is over,

14:22.304 --> 14:25.043
why don't you come back
to Stillwater with me,

14:25.086 --> 14:26.739
help me fix
up the store?

14:26.782 --> 14:28.043
It's all boarded up.

14:28.086 --> 14:30.782
I could use an extra hand.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.217
I got a job to do.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.652
Well, the job can wait.

14:36.695 --> 14:38.130
[Gibbs chuckles,
screen door creaks]

14:43.086 --> 14:45.565
[door unlocking]

14:45.608 --> 14:47.521
[creaks]

14:53.086 --> 14:56.391
Is there something wrong
with the front door?

14:56.434 --> 14:59.217
Wouldn't have been much
of a surprise, then.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.130
How'd you get past the agents?

15:01.173 --> 15:04.478
Dad, meet Mike Franks.

15:04.521 --> 15:06.000
Mind if I
make myself

15:06.043 --> 15:07.391
at home?

15:07.434 --> 15:11.086
What took you so long, cowboy?

15:22.652 --> 15:24.217
Three fingers for me, probie.

15:29.521 --> 15:31.608
Thought you were dead.

15:31.652 --> 15:33.130
I got better.
[laughs]

15:37.086 --> 15:40.782
So what happened after
the gunfight that day?

15:40.826 --> 15:42.956
I was hurt pretty bad.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I holed up in a little convent
south of La Paz.

15:47.043 --> 15:49.173
Padre there owed me.

15:49.217 --> 15:52.130
You know, drinking wine

15:52.173 --> 15:54.608
and playing cards
with the sisters,

15:54.652 --> 15:57.043
I never been closer to God.

15:57.086 --> 16:00.260
Hmm, before that, back in May.

16:00.304 --> 16:05.260
After I got your call and
made sure the girls were safe,

16:05.304 --> 16:07.260
I took on Bell's men.

16:07.304 --> 16:12.217
They burned my little piece
of heaven to the ground.

16:12.260 --> 16:15.434
I got most of 'em.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.304
They only got
a little piece of me.

16:19.434 --> 16:21.695
Thanks for coming.

16:21.739 --> 16:24.217
Wasn't an option.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.217
There's always options.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.217
You got yourself
in a heap of trouble,

16:28.260 --> 16:30.260
messing with the wrong familia.

16:30.304 --> 16:35.217
There's some big guns after
you down there-- up here.

16:35.260 --> 16:39.695
Sweet little Paloma's got
a hornet up her skirt...

16:39.739 --> 16:42.347
and her sights
are set on revenge.

16:42.391 --> 16:44.956
Think I'd miss that?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.869
Dangerous.

16:47.913 --> 16:51.086
Do what you have to for family.

16:51.130 --> 16:54.260
What rule is that?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.043
The unspoken one.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.043
[laughs]

17:05.521 --> 17:06.782
So, what do you think?

17:06.826 --> 17:08.826
This one, or this one?

17:08.869 --> 17:10.956
What's Darren know
about collars?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.956
Nothing, but after guarding me
for four months,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.260
I've come to value
his quiet opinion.

17:16.304 --> 17:17.608
You got something?

17:17.652 --> 17:19.043
I got a lot.

17:19.086 --> 17:21.434
I analyzed everything in
Estaban Lopez's G.I. tract,

17:21.478 --> 17:22.826
and based on

17:22.869 --> 17:26.043
major mass spec's icky
findings, Ducky was right.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.000
Paloma and her men were eating
their way through the South.

17:28.043 --> 17:30.260
I found traces of
blue crab, salt pork,

17:30.304 --> 17:32.434
alligator--
all local proteins

17:32.478 --> 17:33.869
and all suggesting

17:33.913 --> 17:36.260
a food trail that leads
from Mississippi to around

17:36.304 --> 17:37.304
the Florida panhandle.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.695
They're moving.Yeah, but that's

17:38.739 --> 17:41.043
just how long food stays
in the human body.

17:41.086 --> 17:42.956
By analyzing
the healing progression

17:43.000 --> 17:44.608
of Lopez's various bug bites,

17:44.652 --> 17:46.695
which range
from a Virginia chigger

17:46.739 --> 17:48.695
to a mosquito
that's indigenous

17:48.739 --> 17:50.043
to the Everglades, I was able

17:50.086 --> 17:52.913
to track his movements
for four months.

17:52.956 --> 17:54.913
Now, assuming
that they were together,

17:54.956 --> 17:57.913
it looks like Paloma's
been on a mission.

17:57.956 --> 17:59.521
Those are drug routes.Yeah,

17:59.565 --> 18:01.608
she wants to make sure that
her product is well-distributed

18:01.652 --> 18:03.217
throughout the East Coast.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.782
She wants us to see that her
business is better than ever.

18:05.826 --> 18:06.869
Look, um, Gibbs,

18:06.913 --> 18:08.869
I know that we should
arrest her,

18:08.913 --> 18:11.086
but in jail or not,
she knows things about you,

18:11.130 --> 18:12.173
like dangerous things.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.043
I mean, I just think
we need a plan.

18:14.086 --> 18:16.260
Yeah, I got one, Abbs.

18:17.391 --> 18:19.565
Well, that's great, Gibbs.

18:19.608 --> 18:21.782
I'd really like
to hear it sometime.

18:21.826 --> 18:22.782
[elevator bell dings]

18:22.826 --> 18:25.260
[inhales deeply]

18:25.304 --> 18:28.173
Ah, I missed
these stained orange walls.

18:28.217 --> 18:30.782
God bless
tacky American bureaucracy.

18:30.826 --> 18:33.478
The prodigal
probie returns.

18:33.521 --> 18:35.086
You know,
I realized something, Tony.

18:35.130 --> 18:37.217
You don't appreciate something
until it's gone.

18:37.260 --> 18:38.739
So you missed me, eh?

18:38.782 --> 18:42.217
No, no, other things,
like breakfast without beer.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.956
I thought that was the Irish.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.130
Canadians, too.

18:45.173 --> 18:46.956
Beer doesn't go
well with eggs or oatmeal.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Why are you so tan?

18:48.043 --> 18:49.478
Why are you so white?

18:49.521 --> 18:51.086
I've always been like this.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.260
It becomes you.

18:52.304 --> 18:53.217
You're lying.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.608
Through my teeth.The reason

18:54.652 --> 18:56.434
Paloma Reynosa never left
is she never wanted to.

18:56.478 --> 18:58.260
[phone rings]Then what

18:58.304 --> 18:59.913
has she been doing here?DiNozzo.

18:59.956 --> 19:01.347
Yeah.
She's solidifying

19:01.391 --> 19:03.173
her cartel pipeline.

19:03.217 --> 19:05.782
Building new relationships,
huh, and now?

19:05.826 --> 19:07.043
Now...

19:07.086 --> 19:08.826
TONY:
On our way....she's coming after me.

19:08.869 --> 19:10.391
That was the DEA.

19:10.434 --> 19:11.391
Got another body.

19:11.434 --> 19:12.608
Dead drug dealer--

19:12.652 --> 19:14.434
Frederick, Maryland.Okay, take him with you,

19:14.478 --> 19:15.652
fill him in on
the way. Ziva?

19:15.695 --> 19:17.565
Alert Maryland
State Police.

19:17.608 --> 19:19.478
Paloma's getting closer,
and she's not sightseeing.

19:20.956 --> 19:22.217
Welcome home, McGee.

19:27.086 --> 19:28.130
[intercom beeps]

19:28.173 --> 19:29.608
RECEPTIONIST:
Excuse me, Director?

19:29.652 --> 19:31.826
What is it?

19:31.869 --> 19:34.391
I have Director David
on a secure line.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.000
Tell Director David
I'll call him back right away.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.304
Yes, sir.

19:41.304 --> 19:42.260
It's need-to-know.

19:42.304 --> 19:43.478
I don't.

19:43.521 --> 19:45.086
That's for sure.

19:45.130 --> 19:48.086
Paloma could have set up
a new pipeline anytime.

19:48.130 --> 19:49.260
Why now?

19:49.304 --> 19:51.260
Fuel to the fire.

19:51.304 --> 19:54.434
Your father-- where is he?

19:54.478 --> 19:56.434
He's at home, safe.

19:56.478 --> 19:58.130
I'd like to keep him
that way.

19:58.173 --> 20:01.913
If Paloma is responsible
for this dealer in Maryland,

20:01.956 --> 20:04.000
I have to think
that's about one thing, Gibbs--

20:04.043 --> 20:06.260
that's sending you
a message.

20:06.304 --> 20:07.956
Nothing I don't know
already, Leon.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.173
I want to move you
and your father to a safe house.

20:12.217 --> 20:13.173
Already in one.

20:13.217 --> 20:14.173
That's what I thought

20:14.217 --> 20:16.173
last year with my wife.

20:16.217 --> 20:19.086
Why not take
every precaution?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.217
I am.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.304
Bringing in Mike Franks
doesn't count.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.478
[chuckles]

20:23.521 --> 20:25.913
I don't want Franks

20:25.956 --> 20:27.956
making things any worse
than they already are.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.304
No, it can't
get any worse.

20:30.347 --> 20:31.652
[door closes]

20:33.130 --> 20:35.782
I hope you're right.

20:35.826 --> 20:38.043
Where'd you learn to drive under
the speed limit like that?

20:38.086 --> 20:39.478
It's impressive.

20:39.521 --> 20:40.956
Saskatchewan?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.086
You never complained
about my driving before.

20:43.130 --> 20:44.173
[Tony chuckles]

20:44.217 --> 20:46.826
Well, I do sense
a change in you, Tim,

20:46.869 --> 20:48.565
maybe a little
French-Canadian influence.

20:48.608 --> 20:49.695
Quebecois?

20:49.739 --> 20:51.608
I am not listening
to this.

20:51.652 --> 20:52.739
You know how much tail

20:52.782 --> 20:54.043
Gretzky and Lemieux got
back in the day?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.608
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

20:55.652 --> 20:57.695
I am not Canadian.

20:57.739 --> 20:59.869
TONY [in Canadian accent]:
No worries, it just happens
by osmosis, you know.

20:59.913 --> 21:01.652
I was there for
two weeks, Tony.

21:01.695 --> 21:02.913
How about a little
Celine Dion

21:02.956 --> 21:04.173
doing the Canadian
national anthem?

21:04.217 --> 21:06.043
Oh, will you just
let us do our jobs?

♪ O, Canada...

21:11.000 --> 21:12.260

21:12.304 --> 21:14.826
Hey, so listen to this.

21:14.869 --> 21:17.608
Witnesses report a
Hispanic woman, mid-30s,

21:17.652 --> 21:19.652
left the store after
they heard a gunshot.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.130
Sounds like our Paloma.

21:21.173 --> 21:23.695
What do we know about
our local butcher here?

21:23.739 --> 21:25.434
Well, his name's
Charles Newburgh.

21:25.478 --> 21:27.000

21:27.043 --> 21:28.434
Hmm.

Chuck is in the chuck.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.434
Yeah, rap sheet's
a mile long,

21:32.478 --> 21:34.347
but he claimed he was
trying to go clean.

21:34.391 --> 21:36.608
Although, local PD
suspects this store

21:36.652 --> 21:39.086
of being a drug
distribution center.

21:40.086 --> 21:41.391
Criminals.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.478
Was it nature
or not enough nurture, Chuck?

21:44.521 --> 21:46.391
Looks like a small caliber
to the back of the head.

21:46.434 --> 21:47.652
He let Paloma get close.

21:47.695 --> 21:49.130
Did you check
the parking lot?

'Cause I'll bet
you anything

21:51.391 --> 21:52.434
Think she stole it?

What better way
to cross state lines

21:54.173 --> 21:56.043
than a no-frills
meat truck?

21:56.086 --> 21:58.000
I'll get a BOLO out.

How long you been
working on that?

22:22.434 --> 22:24.130
About two months.

22:27.043 --> 22:29.913
What's next, basket weaving?

22:29.956 --> 22:32.782
You and me, Jackson,

22:32.826 --> 22:35.260
we're old enough to know
what's important.

22:35.304 --> 22:37.739
And sitting here
whittling is no way

22:37.782 --> 22:39.695
to watch a clock tick down.

bring it on.

22:45.217 --> 22:47.434
Yeah.

I'm not looking forward
to the next one.

Eh, don't listen to him, Dad.

23:01.956 --> 23:04.043
Jethro, what he's
saying makes sense.

23:04.086 --> 23:05.434
Thanks, Mike.I've got
an opinion;

23:05.478 --> 23:08.000
he's got a right
to hear it.
GIBBS:
Yeah, well,

This is so...

from a friend.

Yes. My friend is a man.

Tell me what?

Sir, someone's here to see you.

That someone have a name?

[elevator bell dings]

24:15.000 --> 24:17.478
I thought we should talk.

You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

24:28.043 --> 24:29.739
Legally, I've done
nothing wrong.

24:29.782 --> 24:32.173
What my sister does
has no impact

24:32.217 --> 24:34.913
on my ability to represent
the Mexican people.

24:34.956 --> 24:37.608
Your sister is a drug dealer
and a murderer,

24:37.652 --> 24:40.043
and I have reason to believe
it runs in the family.

24:40.086 --> 24:41.565
Your opinion is unfounded.

24:41.608 --> 24:42.565
Your men fired

24:42.608 --> 24:44.130
on one of my agents.

24:44.173 --> 24:45.913
My men?

24:45.956 --> 24:49.347
I was in as much danger
as Agent DiNozzo and Mr. Franks.

24:49.391 --> 24:51.956
What do you want?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.347
Diplomacy.

24:54.391 --> 24:57.739
Ah, easy to say,
hard to achieve.

24:57.782 --> 24:59.347
Hmm, maybe not.

24:59.391 --> 25:02.565
My sister is in your country
to procure a new drug pipeline

25:02.608 --> 25:04.869
from Mexico
to the Canadian border.

25:04.913 --> 25:06.869
I can give
you details--

25:06.913 --> 25:09.652
details that will cripple
her operation.

25:09.695 --> 25:11.608
In exchange for what?

25:11.652 --> 25:13.521
Extradition.

25:13.565 --> 25:16.565
Let me take Paloma
back to Mexico to be tried.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.347
Your sister could have bribed
her way across the border

25:23.391 --> 25:26.043
at any time
over the last four months.

25:26.086 --> 25:27.695
Why bring her home now?

25:27.739 --> 25:30.304
Because my country recognizes
the trouble that she has caused.

25:30.347 --> 25:32.434
I don't buy it.

25:32.478 --> 25:35.608
Diplomacy, remember?

25:37.565 --> 25:39.521
I'll have to discuss this
internally--

25:39.565 --> 25:40.869
State Department, DEA.

25:40.913 --> 25:43.565
Of course.
No promises,
no guarantees.

25:43.608 --> 25:46.217
It's up to you, Director.

So many lives,

25:47.652 --> 25:49.695
millions in drug money.

25:49.739 --> 25:53.782
International relationships
are often built on compromise.

25:53.826 --> 25:57.130
Not my relationships.

26:03.217 --> 26:05.478
What do you think
they're talking about?

26:05.521 --> 26:08.347
I can think of a few things
I'd like to say to Señor Rivera.

26:08.391 --> 26:10.304
Things that would probably
get you arrested.

26:10.347 --> 26:12.608
It wouldn't be
the first time.

26:14.217 --> 26:16.391
Is Rivera smiling?

26:16.434 --> 26:19.391
Saw a cat smile
like that once.

How's your sister,
Alejandro?

26:35.521 --> 26:37.521

26:37.565 --> 26:39.521
Considering the stress
of the situation,

26:39.565 --> 26:42.173
it's nice to see you
in good spirits.

26:47.956 --> 26:49.173
Señor Rivera.

Wow.

26:53.043 --> 26:54.695
What are you doing here?

26:54.739 --> 26:58.565
Abby, would you believe
I came to see you?

26:58.608 --> 27:02.565
Um... no.

27:02.608 --> 27:05.695
You know, I never did get
that report.

27:05.739 --> 27:08.956
Well, I've told you multiple
times that I sent it.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.913
Really, I did.

27:10.956 --> 27:12.217
You know, it's funny.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.521
Ms. Hart was looking
into the situation as well,

27:14.565 --> 27:16.304
and now she's

27:16.347 --> 27:18.173
out of the country.

27:18.217 --> 27:20.956
I assume you have another
printout of your findings.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.434
No, there was just one.

27:23.478 --> 27:25.434
Hmm.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.652
You know,
I'm terribly disappointed

27:27.695 --> 27:28.869
with how things turned out.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.739
But look at me rambling.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.000
It's late,
and you should get home.

27:33.043 --> 27:34.434
Yeah, be careful.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.043
The roads can be
dangerous at night.

27:36.086 --> 27:38.652
What did you just say?

27:38.695 --> 27:40.173
Nothing inappropriate, I hope.

27:40.217 --> 27:43.565
You want to threaten someone,
you can threaten me.

27:45.739 --> 27:48.130
Not the people
I work with.

27:48.173 --> 27:53.043
Your team can be hotheaded
and reactionary, Director.

27:53.086 --> 27:54.521
They're not doing you
any favors.

27:54.565 --> 27:56.695
Let me do you one.

27:56.739 --> 27:59.695
Somebody show Señor Rivera
out, before he gets hurt.

27:59.739 --> 28:01.347
By whom?

28:01.391 --> 28:02.913
By me.

I wish I had never
gone to Mexico,

28:15.565 --> 28:17.826
never offered to
help Alejandro.

28:17.869 --> 28:20.565
I wish I had never
finished that damn report.

28:20.608 --> 28:22.434
He's just trying to get
inside your head, Abbs.

28:22.478 --> 28:24.434
Oh, he is inside
my head, Gibbs,

28:24.478 --> 28:26.739
and he's making
himself right at home.

28:26.782 --> 28:29.347
Not going to let
anything happen to you.

28:30.739 --> 28:33.347
Jethro, I'm glad
I caught you.

Look at this.

28:35.913 --> 28:37.521
That's a Mexican
Day of the Dead doll.

28:37.565 --> 28:39.826
Precisely-- Day of the Dead--
and I just found it

28:39.869 --> 28:43.217
neatly tucked against
my windshield.

28:43.260 --> 28:45.043
ABBY:
I've got one, too.

28:45.086 --> 28:48.086
A message perhaps
from this afternoon's

28:52.826 --> 28:54.130
Yeah.

28:54.173 --> 28:58.130
Don't look forward to the day
you stop suffering

28:58.173 --> 28:59.652
because when it comes,

28:59.695 --> 29:01.086
you'll know you're dead.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.260
Got more Tennessee Williams
for me, Paloma?

You remember how much I enjoy
his work, Gibbs.

the other injured.

a BOLO on Paloma.

30:39.739 --> 30:40.913
You mean she was here?

30:45.695 --> 30:48.000
Why didn't she just
finish the job?

30:48.043 --> 30:50.347
Because she's not done yet.

anything about it.

Where is she?

31:09.956 --> 31:13.347
If I knew, would
I still be here?

31:13.391 --> 31:15.173
Would I be so interested
in striking a deal?

31:15.217 --> 31:17.478
I'm willing to give you
all this information...

You go after my father
and then you go after my team?

Does your sister want a fight?

Because if she does,
let's settle this right now.

She's got one.

I was merely having dinner
as a guest in your country.

31:31.869 --> 31:33.521
Are you really threatening
a representative

31:33.565 --> 31:34.652
of the Mexican
government?

31:34.695 --> 31:36.304
I don't know, am I?

31:36.347 --> 31:37.608
Mr. Ambassador,

31:37.652 --> 31:39.434
we have a situation.

must be tired.
