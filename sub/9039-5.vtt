WEBVTT

00:05.900 --> 00:06.900
- HEY.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.067
- HEY.

00:08.067 --> 00:09.433
- YOU KNOW, I ALMOST DIED TODAY.

00:09.433 --> 00:10.833
- REALLY?

00:10.833 --> 00:15.100
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY
WHEN I TELL YOU I ALMOST DIED?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.967
- WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?

00:16.967 --> 00:18.100
- "OH, MY GOD, RAY.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.167
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"

00:19.167 --> 00:21.433
- WHAT HAPPENED?

00:21.433 --> 00:23.733
- I'M IN THE PRESS BOX,
RIGHT?

00:23.733 --> 00:24.833
I'M WATCHING THE GAME,

00:24.833 --> 00:26.033
- YEAH.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.267
- AND I'M EATING
A SOFT PRETZEL,

00:27.267 --> 00:28.700
BUT THESE PRETZELS
THEY HAVE,

00:28.700 --> 00:30.333
THEY'RE NOT MOIST,
YOU KNOW.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.867
THEY'RE BIGGER
THAN THE OTHER ONES,

00:31.867 --> 00:33.233
BUT THEY'RE VERY DRY.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.433
ANYWAY, THE SALT
DOESN'T STICK TO THEM.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.133
IT JUST FALLS EVERYWHERE.

00:37.133 --> 00:38.133
- OH, MY GOD.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.433
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:43.300 --> 00:44.300
- YOU GONNA MOCK?

00:44.300 --> 00:46.000
YOU JUST GONNA MOCK?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.467
- ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.800
OKAY, SO THE SALT DIDN'T
STAY ON YOUR PRETZEL.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.000
- YES.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.733
ALL RIGHT, SO I'M--

00:55.733 --> 00:58.567
I'M BENDING DOWN TO WIPE
THE SALT OFF MY SHIRT,

00:58.567 --> 00:59.700
AND BAM!

00:59.700 --> 01:01.400
A FOUL BALL
COMES FLYING INTO THE BOOTH.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.267
IT CAME THIS CLOSE
TO HITTING ME.

01:03.267 --> 01:04.767
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

01:04.767 --> 01:06.967
I FELT ITS WIND.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.400
AND THEN I TURNED,
AND ANDY,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.133
WHO JUST GOT
A TURKEY AND CHEESE SANDWICH,

01:10.133 --> 01:12.867
THE BALL KNOCKS IT
OFF HIS TRAY.

01:12.867 --> 01:16.400
THE SODA, PICKLES, CHIPS,
CHOCOLATE CAKE, EVERYTHING.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.900
- YOU GET CHOCOLATE CAKE
IN THE PRESS BOX?

01:20.900 --> 01:22.333
- IT WAS FRIDAY.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.700
WE GET A DIFFERENT CAKE
EVERY FRIDAY.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.100
BUT YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.600
I'M GETTING THE POINT.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.833
A BALL BOUNCED INTO YOUR WORLD
AND DISTURBED PARADISE.

01:28.833 --> 01:31.533
- YEAH, BUT THE BALL DOESN'T
JUST BOUNCE IN THERE, OKAY?

01:31.533 --> 01:32.867
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:32.867 --> 01:34.033
WHEN A FOUL BALL
COMES AT YOU.

01:34.033 --> 01:37.333
- DON'T CHILDREN CATCH THEM?

01:37.333 --> 01:39.700
- YEAH, THEY CATCH
THE ONES THAT COME--

01:39.700 --> 01:41.733
"OH, LOOK, BALLIE, OOH."

01:41.733 --> 01:45.100
BUT THIS ONE CAME IN,
"RAY BARONE."

01:45.100 --> 01:46.300
- BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE,

01:46.300 --> 01:49.533
IT SAID,
"CHOCOLATE CAKE."

01:49.533 --> 01:52.233
- YEAH, YEAH.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.667
ALL RIGHT, MAKE FUN, OKAY?

01:54.667 --> 01:57.367
WHEN THE BALL DOES
TAKE MY HEAD OFF,

01:57.367 --> 02:01.167
MAYBE YOU WON'T BE SO
MOCKULATORY.

02:08.933 --> 02:10.333
HEY.
- HEY.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.233
LISTEN, HONEY, CAN YOU BE HOME
BY 6:00 TONIGHT?

02:12.233 --> 02:14.567
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH AN ATTORNEY.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.067
- WELL, NINE YEARS.

02:19.067 --> 02:22.500
I HAD SEVEN IN THE POOL.

02:28.567 --> 02:31.333
- HE'S MEETING WITH US
ABOUT OUR WILLS.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.133
- WILLS?

02:32.133 --> 02:33.133
NO, NO, NO.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.200
I DO NOT WANT A WILL.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.700
IT'S BAD LUCK.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.567
LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN
PUTTING THIS OFF FOR YEARS.

02:37.567 --> 02:39.533
OKAY, AND I WOULD THINK YOU'D
WANNA BE PREPARED,

02:39.533 --> 02:44.767
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOUR
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE.

02:44.767 --> 02:45.767
- NEAR DEATH.

02:45.767 --> 02:49.500
I WAS GOING FOR PITY SEX.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.233
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

02:51.233 --> 02:54.067
I MEAN, YOU WERE FINE
WHEN WE DID THE LIFE INSURANCE.

02:54.067 --> 02:58.100
- INSURANCE IS TOO DULL
TO BE SCARY.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.133
BY THE WAY,
HOW MUCH DO YOU GET IF I DIE?

03:00.133 --> 03:01.667
- $800,000.

03:02.967 --> 03:05.733
- THAT WAS A LITTLE FAST.

03:05.733 --> 03:07.267
YEAH.

03:07.267 --> 03:09.567
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER,
YOU GOT TO LOOK THAT UP.

03:09.567 --> 03:10.567
BUT THAT NUMBER?

03:10.567 --> 03:12.800
OH, YEAH.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.367
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT ON
THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE.

03:15.367 --> 03:19.733
- MA WANTED ME TO TELL YOU
SHE'S MAKING FRITTATAS.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.567
- HEY, ROBERT, YOU HAVE A WILL,
RIGHT?

03:21.567 --> 03:22.567
- WHY?

03:22.567 --> 03:24.333
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

03:24.333 --> 03:27.100
IS THAT WHY
MA'S MAKING FRITTATAS?

03:27.100 --> 03:28.533
- RAY AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT WILLS,

03:28.533 --> 03:30.067
AND HE DOESN'T
WANT TO MAKE ONE.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.567
- OH, WHY NOT?

03:31.567 --> 03:33.933
- BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT'S GONNA TEMPT FATE.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.633
- NO, NO, NO, SILLY.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.900
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WILL,
YOU'RE TEMPTING FATE.

03:37.900 --> 03:38.967
"I DON'T NEED A WILL.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.100
I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER."

03:40.100 --> 03:44.033
MANHOLE.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.133
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.067
- RAYMOND, LISTEN TO ME.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.500
YOU NEED TO HAVE A WILL

03:56.500 --> 03:58.400
AND EAT A FIBROUS BREAKFAST
EVERY MORNING

03:58.400 --> 04:01.267
AND NOTHING CAN TOUGH YOU.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.167
- MABYE YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.600
- OH, THAT'S WHAT CONVINCES YOU?

04:05.600 --> 04:08.000
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THIS FOR SIX YEARS.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.700
- YOU DIDN'T FALL
IN A MANHOLE.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.467
HE KNOWS HOW
TO GET THROUGH TO ME.

04:13.467 --> 04:17.367
- SEE IF YOU CAN
GET HIM TO FLOSS.

04:17.367 --> 04:20.400
- WHATEVER YOU NEED.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.267
- THAT'S IT, ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE DOING A WILL.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.000
I'M LOADING UP ON FIBER.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.867
AND YOU'RE OUT 800 LARGE.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.233
- YEAH.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.700
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS ALL LOOKS GOOD.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.633
- WE SHOULD PUT SOMETHING
IN THERE THAT IF I DIE

04:35.633 --> 04:38.767
YOU CAN'T MARRY
ANOTHER MAN NAMED RAY.

04:42.033 --> 04:44.000
- EXCUSE ME?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.933
- WELL, BECAUSE EVENTUALLY
EVERYONE WOULD CALL HIM RAY

04:46.933 --> 04:49.433
AND ME "DEAD RAY".

04:52.900 --> 04:54.000
- I DON'T THINK I CAN--

04:54.000 --> 04:56.667
- JUST IGNORE HIM.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.267
- ALL RIGHTY.

04:58.267 --> 05:00.267
NOW, ALL THAT
REMAINS IS THE ISSUE

05:00.267 --> 05:02.933
OF WHO SHOULD BE GRANTED
GUARDIANSHIP OF THE CHILDREN.

05:02.933 --> 05:04.900
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:04.900 --> 05:06.233
- GUARDIANSHIP
IN THE EVENT

05:06.233 --> 05:08.767
THAT BOTH OF YOU
DIE AT THE SAME TIME.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.500
- WOW, PARTY POOPER.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.367
WELL, I GUESS THAT WOULD BE
MY PARENTS FRANK AND MARIE--

05:17.367 --> 05:19.467
- UH, RAY, I DON'T KNOW

05:19.467 --> 05:22.567
IF THEY'RE REALLY
THE BEST CHOICE.

05:22.567 --> 05:24.933
- WELL, I MEAN,
THEY'RE OVER HERE

05:24.933 --> 05:26.200
ALL THE TIME ANYWAY, RIGHT?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
THEY KNOW
WHERE EVERYTHING IS.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.733
- JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE CONVENIENT

05:29.733 --> 05:31.933
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.733
- YOU WANT YOUR PARENTS?

05:33.733 --> 05:36.567
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A KID-FRIENDLY HOUSE.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.333
ALL THE POINTY
METAL SCULPTURES.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.767
AND YOUR FATHER,
YOU KNOW...

05:40.767 --> 05:41.767
[whistles]

05:41.767 --> 05:44.033
- RAY.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.667
WE'LL HAVE TO
DISCUSS THIS.

05:49.667 --> 05:50.667
- DISCUSS.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.400
HERE WE GO.

05:52.400 --> 05:57.200
HEY, MAYBE YOU BETTER
TAKE US OFF THE METER.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.700
TAKE YOUR TIME.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.000
- LOOK, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE A RELATIVE.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.500
- NO?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.267
- NO, I MEAN, THE CHARACTER
OF THE COUPLE

06:04.267 --> 06:05.300
IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.700
YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE THEIR VALUES?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.800
ARE THEY LOVING?

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
ARE THEY PATIENT?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.567
ARE THEY HONEST?

06:10.567 --> 06:12.233
- IF WE FIND
PEOPLE LIKE THAT,

06:12.233 --> 06:15.367
WE SHOULD GIVE THEM
THE CHILDREN RIGHT NOW.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.133
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:21.133 --> 06:24.167
WE DON'T HAVE
TO COMPLETE THIS NOW.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.967
ONCE YOU TWO
GET THIS IRONED OUT,

06:25.967 --> 06:27.700
YOU CAN JUST CALL ME
WITH THE NAME.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.433
- OKAY, WE'LL PROBABLY
CALL YOU TOMORROW.

06:29.433 --> 06:30.667
- UNLESS WE DIE
BEFORE THEN,

06:30.667 --> 06:33.867
IN WHICH CASE,
YOU GET 'EM.

06:33.867 --> 06:36.000
HOPE YOU GOT A SOFA BED.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.833
I THINK HE LIKES ME.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.467
- YEAH.

06:45.167 --> 06:46.500
WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS,
THOUGH.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.700
WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.700
WHO ARE WE GONNA GET?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.333
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

06:50.333 --> 06:51.733
- I HATE EVERYONE.

06:51.733 --> 06:52.733
- YEAH, SEE, ME TOO.

06:52.733 --> 06:53.933
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

06:53.933 --> 06:55.133
WHAT ABOUT
BERNIE AND LINDA?

06:55.133 --> 06:56.967
- THEY JUST HAD A BABY.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.400
- SO WHY WOULD THEY WANT MORE?

06:58.400 --> 07:02.233
LOOK, THEY'LL BE
EXPERIENCED PARENTS,

07:02.233 --> 07:03.867
AND WE LOVE THEM.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.600
- YEAH, I GUESS THEY'RE GOOD.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.133
AND BERNIE ALWAYS HAS
CANDY IN HIS POCKET.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.267
- THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY
BE THE ONES.

07:11.267 --> 07:13.633
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
SO WE'RE SETTLED?

07:13.633 --> 07:14.867
- YEAH.

07:14.867 --> 07:15.867
SO IT'S
BERNIE AND LINDA.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.100
WE HAVE A WILL,

07:17.100 --> 07:18.667
AND YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.100
HEY.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.433
GUESS WE DIDN'T DISPLEASE
ANY OF YOUR VENGEFUL GODS.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.333
- HI, DEARS.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.333
I SAW YOU HAD SOME
STORE-BOUGHT PUDDING,

07:30.333 --> 07:34.967
AND I THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT
WANT TO TRY SOMETHING HOMEMADE.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.000
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.500
- OKAY.

07:39.833 --> 07:42.400
"ATTORNEY AT LAW"?

07:42.400 --> 07:44.833
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

07:44.833 --> 07:46.567
- NOTHING.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.100
- ARE THERE
MARITAL PROBLEMS?

07:48.100 --> 07:51.167
- NO.

07:51.167 --> 07:53.400
WE WERE JUST MAKING OUT
OUR WILLS, MARIE.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.167
- OH, GOOD FOR YOU, HONEY.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.733
SEE, THAT SHOWS A LOT
OF FORESIGHT, RAYMOND.

07:58.733 --> 08:00.267
- YUP.

08:00.267 --> 08:01.700
ISN'T IT GOOD
TO GET IT ALL OUT OF THE WAY

08:01.700 --> 08:03.633
AND KNOW THAT EVERYTHING
NOW IS UNDER CONTROL,

08:03.633 --> 08:06.467
AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE CHILDREN?

08:09.700 --> 08:13.033
- YUP.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.367
- MARIE?

08:15.367 --> 08:18.133
- YEAH.

08:18.133 --> 08:20.167
- WE DECIDED
THAT BERNIE AND LINDA

08:20.167 --> 08:22.300
ARE GONNA BE
THEIR GUARDIANS.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.700
- THANKS FOR THE PUDDING.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.333
- YOU'RE LEAVING
THE CHILDREN TO STRANGERS?

08:43.333 --> 08:45.800
- MA, BERNIE AND LINDA
AREN'T STRANGERS.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.067
- PLEASE, YOU DON'T OWE ME
ANY EXPLANATION.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.600
THEY'RE YOUR CHILDREN.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.400
IT'S YOUR LIFE, ISN'T IT?

08:54.400 --> 08:57.367
- THAT'S BEEN THE DREAM.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.733
- I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU.

09:03.733 --> 09:08.600
I JUST CAME OVER TO
TRY TO, YOU KNOW, HELP.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.267
- MA, IF BERNIE AND LINDA
DROP DEAD,

09:11.267 --> 09:14.600
YOU'RE ON DECK.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.033
- WELL, THANK YOU.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.033
OH, AND THAT'S
FOR THE CHILDREN.

09:19.033 --> 09:22.633
TELL 'EM IT'S FROM
A FRIEND.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.667
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

09:26.667 --> 09:28.567
THIS COULD BE A GOOD LESSON
FOR ME:

09:28.567 --> 09:31.000
TO LEARN TO BE CONTENT
WITH WHAT IS

09:31.000 --> 09:34.500
AND NOT TO HOPE FOR
WHAT COULD BE.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.433
- SO WHAT COULD BE IS
US DYING,

09:36.433 --> 09:37.933
AND YOU RAISING
OUR CHILDREN.

09:37.933 --> 09:41.233
- WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.167
- I SAW PUDDING SKIN
IN THE SINK.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.800
- OH, FRANK.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.267
HAVE YOU HEARD, FRANK?

09:48.267 --> 09:51.000
APPARENTLY, YOU AND I
ARE NOT FIT PARENTS.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.233
- I STILL WANT PUDDING.

09:56.133 --> 09:57.500
- HEY.
- OH, AND YOU.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.667
YOU'RE NOT UP TO
THEIR STANDARDS, EITHER.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.000
- I KNOW.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.200
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.767
- WE HAD TO PICK GUARDIANS
FOR THE KIDS.

10:06.767 --> 10:07.767
- AND IT'S NOT US?

10:07.767 --> 10:08.767
- NO.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.467
- OKAY.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.833
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
WANTED THE KIDS?

10:12.833 --> 10:15.033
- WOULD YOU?

10:17.300 --> 10:19.100
- I WASN'T EVEN ASKED.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.267
- WELL, ROBERT,
WE JUST, YOU KNOW--

10:21.267 --> 10:22.500
- WHO'D YOU PICK?

10:22.500 --> 10:25.367
- LINDA AND BERNIE
GRUENFELDER.

10:25.367 --> 10:29.033
- BERNIE GRUENFELDER.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.033
AH, LET'S SEE.

10:30.033 --> 10:31.800
A CHUBBY JET SKI SALESMAN

10:31.800 --> 10:36.167
VERSUS A BLOOD-RELATED
PROTECTOR OF THE PEOPLE.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.200
AH, WELL,
THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

10:43.133 --> 10:45.633
- WHERE'S THE WHIPPED CREAM?

10:45.633 --> 10:47.967
- MARIE, PLEASE TRY
TO UNDERSTAND.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.600
- I UNDERSTAND.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.667
YOU PREFER TO GIVE YOUR CHILDREN
TO GYPSIES INSTEAD OF ME.

10:52.667 --> 10:53.800
- AH, CHEER UP, MARIE.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.267
WE JUST DODGED
THREE SCREAMIN' BULLETS.

10:57.267 --> 10:58.900
HEY, DID HE TAKE
THE PUDDING?

10:58.900 --> 11:00.067
HEY.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.600
PUDDING.

11:03.700 --> 11:07.267
- OH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.567
IT'S YOUR FATHER,
ISN'T IT?

11:12.567 --> 11:15.033
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.633
IF YOU WERE TO--
GOD FORBID--

11:17.633 --> 11:18.967
AND I GET THE CHILDREN,

11:18.967 --> 11:22.567
I'M WILLING TO LEAVE HIM.

11:30.467 --> 11:33.000
- OH, SHE IS JUST
A LITTLE ANGEL.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.300
- YEAH, WHEN
SHE'S SLEEPING.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.200
- YOU SHOULD HEAR
THE SET OF LUNGS ON HER.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.500
WHOO.
- OH, YEAH.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.167
WHEN SHE'S UNHAPPY,
YOU KNOW IT.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.733
- YEAH, BABIES ARE LOUD.

11:44.967 --> 11:46.800
YOU KNOW WHO'S QUIET,
THOUGH?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.233
OLDER KIDS.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.800
- YEAH, WELL,
YOUR KIDS ARE GREAT.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.300
- YEAH, YEAH, THEY ARE.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.300
- SO, LINDA, MOTHERHOOD
REALLY AGREES WITH YOU.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.200
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.767
- THANK YOU.

12:01.767 --> 12:05.067
I'M WEARING MORE MAKEUP
THAN A DRAG QUEEN.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.567
- AND NURSING BRAS,

12:06.567 --> 12:08.500
ARE THEY AS HORRIBLE
AS THEY USED TO BE?

12:08.500 --> 12:12.567
- THEY'RE VERY COMPLICATED.

12:12.567 --> 12:14.733
- THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD THING
ABOUT THE OLDER KIDS.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.133
FORGET ABOUT THE BREAST.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.167
YOU FEED 'EM RIGHT OUT
OF THE FRIDGE.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.200
- RAY, PLEASE.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.233
- WELL, YOU DO.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.667
[baby coos]

12:22.667 --> 12:25.433
- WAS THAT AN AWAKE SOUND
OR A SLEEP SOUND?

12:25.433 --> 12:27.033
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:27.033 --> 12:32.167
JUST WRITE DOWN,
"SOUND AT 7:07."

12:33.367 --> 12:36.000
- ALL THE BOOKS SAY
TO KEEP A SLEEP JOURNAL.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.533
- OH, BERNIE LOVES
THE BOOKS.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.333
HELPS ME FEEL
A LITTLE MORE IN CONTROL.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.967
- THAT'S FROM
ONE OF THE BOOKS.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.400
- IT'S NOT YOURS!

12:43.400 --> 12:45.867
I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU,
I HATE YOU!

12:45.867 --> 12:49.867
[all screaming]

12:49.867 --> 12:51.467
- [laughs]

12:51.467 --> 12:54.100
WRITE IT DOWN:
"7:08, HAVIN' FUN."

12:57.733 --> 12:59.533
- YOU WANT HELP ME
IN THE KITCHEN, RAY?

12:59.533 --> 13:00.533
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.000
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
- OH, BOY.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
[laughter]

13:03.000 --> 13:04.667
- THANKS.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.800
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

13:08.800 --> 13:10.100
- NOTHING, IT'S JUST,

13:10.100 --> 13:12.867
THE KIDS ARE RUINING IT.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.300
- YOU'RE RUINING IT.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.400
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO SELL 'EM A USED CAR.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.767
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
THROW IN THE CAR.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.900
- WOULD YOU JUST
ACT NORMAL, HUH?

13:22.900 --> 13:25.667
LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH
AND ASK 'EM.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.000
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.600
HOW YOU GONNA ASK 'EM?

13:28.600 --> 13:29.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.767
I CAN'T REHEARSE IT.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.167
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY,

13:32.167 --> 13:33.900
"HEY, WHEN WE DIE
AND YOU GO TO THE FUNERAL,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.600
BRING THE MINIVAN."

13:40.100 --> 13:42.233
- OH, HELLO.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.200
I NOTICED YOU HAD COMPANY.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.333
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

13:46.333 --> 13:50.767
IF IT ISN'T BERNIE
AND LINDA GRUENFELDER.

13:50.767 --> 13:53.100
- ROBERT, THEY'RE JUST
OVER FOR DINNER.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.233
- OH, JUST DINNER?

13:54.233 --> 13:55.867
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.633
WHY IS YOUR SHIRT
TUCKED IN TONIGHT, RAYMOND?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.267
THIS IS NO ORDINARY DINNER.

14:03.267 --> 14:05.833
YOU'RE GIVING AWAY
THE CHILDREN, AREN'T YOU?

14:05.833 --> 14:08.100
- ROBERT, DON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.600
- IT IS A BIG DEAL.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.533
HOW COULD YOU
CHOOSE THEM OVER ME?

14:11.533 --> 14:12.633
I'M FAMILY.

14:12.633 --> 14:13.767
- WE LOVE YOU, ROBERT,

14:13.767 --> 14:15.467
BUT THERE'S
A LOT OF FACTORS, OKAY?

14:15.467 --> 14:17.733
WE PUT A GREAT DEAL
OF THOUGHT INTO THIS.

14:17.733 --> 14:23.067
YOU'RE SINGLE, AND YOU
HAVE A DANGEROUS JOB.

14:23.067 --> 14:24.933
- AND IF YOU WERE TO
DROP ONE OF THEM,

14:24.933 --> 14:27.767
IT'S VERY, VERY FAR.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.233
- AND ALSO, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

14:38.233 --> 14:40.067
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ME
AS A HUMAN BEING.

14:40.067 --> 14:41.700
- OH, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.133
- LOOK, YOU KNOW, IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS, OKAY?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.933
ALLY, MICHAEL,
AND GEOFFREY GRUENFELDER.

14:46.933 --> 14:49.033
OH, ROLLS RIGHT OFF
THE TONGUE.

14:50.133 --> 14:51.600
- HEY, WHOA,
WHERE YOU GOING, MAN?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.033
- I THOUGHT I'D LEAVE
VIA THE FRONT DOOR.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.733
OR IS THAT JUST
FOR FIT GUARDIANS?

14:56.733 --> 14:59.767
- SHE'S ADORABLE.

14:59.767 --> 15:00.700
[both gasp]

15:05.033 --> 15:06.800
- MARIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

15:06.800 --> 15:09.333
- OH, WELL, I SAW A STRANGE CAR
PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY,

15:09.333 --> 15:11.233
AND I THOUGHT
SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.233
- OKAY, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

15:14.233 --> 15:15.567
WE'D LIKE TO SPEND
THE EVENING ALONE

15:15.567 --> 15:17.200
WITH LINDA
AND BERNIE TONIGHT.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.067
- WELL, I JUST CAME OVER
TO SEE THE BABY.

15:19.067 --> 15:20.933
YOU KNOW
HOW I LOVE CHILDREN.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.533
- YEAH.

15:22.533 --> 15:23.500
YEAH.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.000
LOOK, HERE'S ONE OF YOURS NOW.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.133
WHY DON'T YOU GO
PUT HIM DOWN FOR A NAP?

15:28.133 --> 15:30.367
- IT'S OKAY, RAY.

15:30.367 --> 15:33.167
MADELINE, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO MRS. BARONE.

15:33.167 --> 15:35.933
- THE BOOKS SAY
NOT TO USE BABY TALK.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.867
- OH, YOU'RE BOOK PARENTS.

15:38.867 --> 15:40.167
- MARIE.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.567
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THE BOOKS ARE GREAT.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.400
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF
STUFF YOU CAN LEARN

15:43.400 --> 15:45.633
FROM EXPERIENCE YOU JUST CAN'T
GET FROM THE BOOKS.

15:45.633 --> 15:46.667
- OH, YEAH?

15:46.667 --> 15:48.267
- A LOT OF EMERGENCY
SITUATION STUFF.

15:48.267 --> 15:49.900
- RAY.
- ROBERT.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.300
- YEAH, LET'S SAY YOUR CHILD
OR A CHILD IN YOUR CARE

15:52.300 --> 15:56.100
HAS PUT A COCOA PUFF
UP HIS NOSE.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.500
- WHAT DO YOU DO?

15:58.500 --> 15:59.800
- COCOA PUFF?

15:59.800 --> 16:02.867
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION, ROBBIE.

16:02.867 --> 16:05.267
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

16:05.267 --> 16:06.500
- THEY'D DO THE RIGHT THING.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.300
COFFEE?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.600
- YEAH, ANYONE WANT COFFEE?

16:08.600 --> 16:12.167
- I'D LOVE SOME.

16:12.167 --> 16:14.633
- STUCK COCOA PUFF.

16:14.633 --> 16:18.133
IT'S A QUANDARY.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.667
- DOES THAT REALLY HAPPEN?

16:19.667 --> 16:21.367
- OH, YES, IT HAPPENS.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.567
DOESN'T IT, RAYMOND?

16:23.567 --> 16:26.167
- HAPPENED TO ME
WHEN I WAS EIGHT.

16:29.067 --> 16:32.833
- AND TEN.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.900
- SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO, DEAR?

16:34.900 --> 16:36.367
- TWEEZERS?

16:36.367 --> 16:38.800
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.667
- EMERGENCY ROOM?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.033
- NOPE.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.800
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.733
YOU CRUNCH AND BLOW.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.167
- CRUNCH AND BLOW?

16:50.167 --> 16:53.300
- [crunching noise]

16:56.833 --> 17:00.667
- I AM VERY SURE
I'M GONNA REMEMBER THAT ONE.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.200
- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.
- THAT WAS FUN.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.167
- GIVE ME ANOTHER.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.767
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S SAY
YOU'RE DRIVING

17:06.767 --> 17:08.233
YOUR SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TO SCHOOL,

17:08.233 --> 17:10.200
AND SHE KEEPS TURNING THE RADIO
LOUDER AND LOUDER

17:10.200 --> 17:11.300
WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.833
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

17:12.833 --> 17:15.067
- YOU TELL HER TO STOP
IN A FIRM BUT LOVING MANNER.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.233
- NO, LINDA?

17:21.700 --> 17:23.100
- IGNORE IT.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.567
- EXCUSE ME?

17:24.567 --> 17:29.467
- WELL, YOU LET HER
TURN IT UP LOUD,

17:29.467 --> 17:31.800
AND THEN SHE'LL,
SHE'LL REALIZE

17:31.800 --> 17:33.633
HOW UNPLEASANT THAT IS,

17:33.633 --> 17:37.733
AND THEN SHE'LL
TURN IT OFF HERSELF.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.633
- AN EXCELLENT ANSWER.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.500
IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN
WHAT A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD

17:41.500 --> 17:44.767
IS DOING IN THE FRONT SEAT
TO BEGIN WITH.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.500
- MY, MY, MY.

17:58.633 --> 17:59.767
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.633
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW;
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.167
- RUINED?
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.133
- YOU'RE A MANIAC;
GO.

18:05.133 --> 18:07.400
- BY THE WAY, I COULDN'T
HELP BUT NOTICE

18:07.400 --> 18:12.100
THAT YOUR INFANT CAR SEAT
WAS POSITIONED IMPROPERLY.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.333
- HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.100
- HEY, DINNER AND A SHOW.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.633
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THEM.

18:23.633 --> 18:26.833
BUT ACTUALLY, WE DID ASK YOU
OVER HERE FOR A REASON.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.433
- NOW?

18:28.433 --> 18:31.333
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
REALLY HAMMERED FIRST.

18:31.333 --> 18:35.433
- YOU KNOW, RAY AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT OUR WILLS,

18:35.433 --> 18:39.200
AND WELL, WE JUST THINK
YOU'RE GREAT PARENTS,

18:39.200 --> 18:41.033
AND WE WERE WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD WANT TO BE

18:41.033 --> 18:42.300
THE GUARDIANS OF OUR KIDS

18:42.300 --> 18:44.600
IF ANYTHING SHOULD
HAPPEN TO US.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.333
- AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT PLANNING ANYTHING.

18:49.333 --> 18:53.700
- OH, THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.667
- WOW.

18:55.667 --> 18:56.733
THIS IS BIG.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.233
- WE LOVE ALLY, MICHAEL,
AND GEOFFREY.

18:59.233 --> 19:01.333
WE LOVE ALL OF YOU.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.567
- OH, WE LOVE YOU, TOO.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.000
THAT'S WHY
WE THOUGHT OF YOU.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.767
- BOY.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.700
I DON'T THINK SO.

19:12.433 --> 19:13.633
- WHAT?

19:13.633 --> 19:19.033
- I MEAN, WE'RE SO FLATTERED,
BUT...

19:21.333 --> 19:25.500
- YOUR FAMILY'S NUTS.

19:25.500 --> 19:30.233
- YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE BOOKS ABOUT THAT.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.967
- MAYBE YOU WANT
TO THINK IT OVER.

19:37.967 --> 19:41.367
- NO, I'M SORRY.

19:41.367 --> 19:42.933
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
AN ACCIDENT

19:42.933 --> 19:48.833
THAT TAKES THEM OUT
THE SAME TIME AS YOU, MAYBE.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.367
- THAT'S OKAY.

19:51.367 --> 19:53.167
- I FEEL JUST TERRIBLE
ABOUT THIS.

19:53.167 --> 19:54.400
- OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.667
BELIEVE ME,
I UNDERSTAND.

19:55.667 --> 19:59.367
I UNDERSTAND.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.467
- HMM.

20:22.433 --> 20:24.000
- WELL, WE SHOULD GET
MADELINE TO BED.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.900
- IT'S GETTING LATE
HERE, YES.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.767
OH, LISTEN, I GOT SOME CANDY
FOR ALLY AND THE TWINS.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.333
- OH, OKAY.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.933
GOOD, THANKS;
THANKS FOR THAT.

20:32.933 --> 20:34.800
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.900
- HEY, I HEAR YOU'RE
GETTING THE KIDS.

20:36.900 --> 20:37.900
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.267
- NO, DAD.

20:39.267 --> 20:40.967
IT'S NOT REALLY GONNA
WORK OUT, SO--

20:40.967 --> 20:41.967
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:41.967 --> 20:43.067
THESE ARE REALLY GREAT KIDS.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.267
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DAD.

20:44.267 --> 20:45.533
IT'S OKAY.

20:45.533 --> 20:46.900
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU, GUYS.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.400
- GOOD NIGHT.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.533
- HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF IT?

21:00.767 --> 21:02.033
- THE WALLACES.

21:02.033 --> 21:03.233
- NO.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.600
THEIR HOUSE
SMELLS LIKE FEET.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.900
WELL, THAT'S IT,

21:07.900 --> 21:09.867
'CAUSE WE'VE GONE
THROUGH EVERYBODY.

21:09.867 --> 21:11.100
- HOW ABOUT THE "Z"S?

21:11.100 --> 21:15.700
- "BRONX ZOO."

21:15.700 --> 21:17.033
- I SAW THAT DOCUMENTARY,

21:17.033 --> 21:21.400
THAT KID THAT WAS
RAISED BY WOLVES.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.433
RIGHT?

21:23.433 --> 21:26.567
HE'S A DENTIST NOW.

21:31.433 --> 21:34.167
- NO, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE,
YOU KNOW?

21:34.167 --> 21:37.033
SOMEONE ELSE.

21:37.033 --> 21:40.667
OH, PLEASE, SOMEONE.

21:40.667 --> 21:44.867
- WE COULD ALWAYS DO
COLD CALLING.

21:44.867 --> 21:48.067
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIDS
ARE STUCK WITH YOUR PARENTS.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.600
- I WILL SAY THIS
ABOUT YOUR FATHER:

21:53.600 --> 21:56.533
HE IS A HAPPY DRUNK.
