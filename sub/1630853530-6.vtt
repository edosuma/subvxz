WEBVTT

00:09.676 --> 00:11.553
All right, folks. Listen up.

00:13.347 --> 00:17.434
The way I learned it, any landing
you can walk away from is a good one.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.270
But Sojourner took a beating
on the way down.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.691
Houston says the damage to her engines
is gonna ground her for good.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.655
Luckily, I have pull
with the Helios commander.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.533
They're gonna be our ride home now.

00:32.616 --> 00:36.453
But first things first, we need to get
to our hab before sundown.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.166
The modules landed three klicks from here.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.626
Now, I don't need to remind you

00:42.709 --> 00:47.881
that Happy Valley gets down to a balmy
minus 100 degrees Celsius at night.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.426
So, yeah, we're gonna have to hoof it.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.055
Grab what you can carry.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.266
We'll come back with the rovers
for the rest.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.687
Welcome to the Red Planet, people.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.077
Inerting hydrazine manifold.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.454
Venting…

01:49.985 --> 01:51.195
Home sweet home.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.666
All right, people.
Let's get inside and power up the hab.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.758
Will, come on.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.689
Wow.

04:26.934 --> 04:31.855
Almost thirty years
after we lost the moon, we have won Mars.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.901
Now, I know people are saying
it was a tie,

04:35.984 --> 04:38.654
but an American ship
is what took them down to the surface,

04:38.737 --> 04:42.324
so in my book, it's an American win,
fair and square.

04:42.407 --> 04:46.578
The race to find water, an essential
resource for all three missions,

04:46.662 --> 04:48.163
has only just begun.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.834
The landing sites
in Valles Marineris were selected

04:51.917 --> 04:56.880
due to their promising indications
of ice deposits under the Martian soil.

04:56.964 --> 05:01.009
The crew of Helios has already located
some small deposits,

05:01.093 --> 05:04.012
enough to combine
with the Martian atmosphere

05:04.096 --> 05:08.225
to begin making the methane fuel needed
for their return trip home.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.060
A particularly vital task,

05:10.143 --> 05:15.190
considering Phoenix is now the only ship
able to take all three crews back to Earth

05:15.274 --> 05:18.527
after Sojourner's engines were damaged
during its landing.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.947
And that isn't the only setback
for NASA and Roscosmos

05:22.030 --> 05:25.617
as their own search for water
has apparently come up dry to this point.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.787
Their situation is further exacerbated

05:28.871 --> 05:32.666
by the reality of accommodating
eight astronauts and cosmonauts

05:32.749 --> 05:35.085
with provisions meant only for six.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.254
These folks up there are busy, busy, busy.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.674
They've got to find water,
create their own oxygen,

05:40.757 --> 05:44.136
set up their nuclear power generator,
grow their own food.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.138
I'm exhausted just hearing about it.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.682
But if that doesn't warm your heart,
I don't know what will.

05:48.765 --> 05:54.688
Americans and Russians working together
as partners after decades of tensions.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.905
And I thought everything was bigger
in America.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.574
Well, we could always stay in your hab.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.452
Where is it again?

06:08.535 --> 06:11.121
That's right.
It's floating out in space with your ship.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.750
Come on, y'all. We're on Mars!

06:14.833 --> 06:16.335
It's an adventure. Embrace it.

06:17.503 --> 06:18.712
Next thing you know,

06:18.795 --> 06:20.214
he'll be singing "we are the world."

06:21.381 --> 06:23.509
All right, people, listen up.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.640
As you can probably tell,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.309
the thermal control systems
are still malfunctioning.

06:32.976 --> 06:37.523
Now, I know it's a pain,
but we will continue to ration water.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.360
Finding water ice is taking longer
than we thought.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.071
So, until we find it,
we got what we brought.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.870
Now, since we lost some of our pre-supply
in the damaged module,

06:51.954 --> 06:54.498
Houston's worked out
some water usage rations.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.501
Half a gallon per person per day.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.586
Now, that includes everything.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.630
Drinking, food rehydration…

07:02.798 --> 07:04.299
and sanitation.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.178
I know. I know.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.557
Meantime, Will, Rolan,

07:11.640 --> 07:14.226
if you two can continue
to repair the thermal controls.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.312
Kelly, keep going with the seedlings.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.275
Dr. Mayakovsky, if you can keep tabs
on people's hydration levels, we can--

07:21.358 --> 07:25.487
Again, please do not give orders
to my crew, Commander.

07:30.701 --> 07:34.162
Commander,
would you please assign your doctor

07:34.246 --> 07:36.999
to keep tabs on people's hydration levels?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.001
If you don't mind.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.046
Thank you so much.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.177
All right, people.
Let's get settled in for the night.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.016
I can't believe I gotta share a bunk
with you again.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.726
It was bad enough on Jamestown.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.686
Oh, come on, man.
We're like The Odd Couple.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.770
Yeah.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.565
I'm the clean one,
and you're the annoying slob.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.358
This is true. This is true.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.111
-Have a good night.
-Yeah.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.609
We were so close, Karen.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.112
So close.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.660
I mean, the storm was still going, and I--

08:55.160 --> 08:56.828
I knew it was dangerous.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.290
There was caution
and terrain alarms going off…

09:02.751 --> 09:04.461
but I was ready to go for it…

09:06.672 --> 09:10.300
until I looked over and saw Danny.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.137
I just…

09:16.557 --> 09:20.102
couldn't bear the thought
of something happening to him.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.607
I mean, he-- he's like a son to me, Karen.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.529
And I just--

09:31.655 --> 09:35.742
I don't know. I just couldn't do it.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.581
I couldn't.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.251
So I pulled up.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.159
Goddamn it. Come on.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.766
-I got a hole in my suit.
-Mist.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.312
Clamp the other glove down on it.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.772
Try to keep it airtight.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.862
This should help with the pain.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.197
Take one every eight hours.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.370
Thanks.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.038
With an injury to your hand, protocol says

11:03.121 --> 11:05.541
you have to go back up to Phoenix
with the next crew changeover

11:05.624 --> 11:07.960
in case you need
more advanced medical treatment.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.962
Come on. Look, it's just a cut.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.713
I don't make the rules, man.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.466
You okay, Danny?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.301
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.097
-Let me see.
-I said I'm fine.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.849
Okay.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.017
So what happened?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.478
Nothing. Drill just went haywire on me.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.356
Okay. Thanks.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.945
Did you remember
to disable the motor drive?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.071
Yes, sir, I did.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.116
Believe it or not,
I know what the hell I'm doing.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.951
I don't need you to fucking look after me.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.672
Margo, I'm gonna need
a little more information than that.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.841
All I can tell you now, Nelson,

11:55.924 --> 12:01.805
is that this person would be a very
valuable asset to the United States.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.558
But in order for them
to be willing to defect,

12:04.641 --> 12:06.101
we would need to

12:07.186 --> 12:11.356
facilitate their
family's removal from the Soviet Union.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.110
We talking black ops?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.407
I suppose. Is that really an option?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.951
It can be,
but I gotta run it up the flagpole.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.622
You're on top of the flagpole, Nelson.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.749
You're chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.126
Only one person
without a boss in this town,

12:31.210 --> 12:32.294
and you know who she is.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.629
Yes, I do.

12:35.464 --> 12:40.219
If it helps, I know DOD is looking for
additional funds for your F-22 project.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.804
Well, somebody's done her homework.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.518
NASA's got a lot of resources
these days, Nelson.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.729
I guess Army-Air Force tickets
aren't gonna do the trick this time, huh?

12:52.731 --> 12:55.442
Okay, Margo. I'll see what I can do.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.612
But I'm gonna need at least a week,
maybe more.

12:59.154 --> 13:02.783
Thank you. This defector
will be a valuable asset to NASA.

13:03.534 --> 13:04.952
I'll speak to you soon.

13:47.578 --> 13:49.121
Think you're the only one who cares?

13:49.204 --> 13:52.082
-I am trying to save this company.
-I don't have to listen to this!

13:52.165 --> 13:54.209
They stay there
for as long as it takes!

13:54.293 --> 13:55.294
Dev.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.464
Dev.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.354
It's nice to see you.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.777
So, what was that all about?

14:21.653 --> 14:24.198
They think I'm taking my eye
off the core business.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.618
Apparently, Mars is costing
a lot more than projected.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.703
We failed, Karen.

14:30.204 --> 14:33.665
We landed on Mars,
and what's everybody talking about today?

14:34.166 --> 14:37.044
Not us. No, we didn't change anything.
We lost.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.422
This isn't over, not by a long shot.

14:43.008 --> 14:46.470
One of my old Polaris contacts
from Roscosmos reached out.

14:47.221 --> 14:50.057
Lenara Catiche.
She wants a meeting with Helios.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.229
I have a feeling it's something
that we're gonna wanna hear.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.065
I'm sorry, did you say "we"?

14:59.358 --> 15:01.068
Does this mean you're coming back?

15:02.152 --> 15:04.112
I have conditions.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.697
Such as?

15:06.615 --> 15:07.950
I wanna be a real partner.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.620
That means real power
and a defined role of COO.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.791
Karen, you know we don't do titles.

15:15.874 --> 15:19.962
Yeah, and that's great at keeping
everyone else the same, other than you.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.757
Anything else?

15:23.841 --> 15:26.301
Yeah, I want an office.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.347
A real one… with a door.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.436
I think it's a primal urge in all of us,

15:36.520 --> 15:38.814
the need, the drive to explore.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.774
It doesn't matter how old you get.

15:41.275 --> 15:45.237
Human beings are always gonna wanna see
what's over that next hill.

15:47.739 --> 15:51.618
Being one of the first people on Mars
makes me feel…

15:53.203 --> 15:54.496
proud.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.457
It's the exact opposite of home.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.710
Havana is…

15:59.793 --> 16:00.878
vibrant…

16:01.378 --> 16:02.379
warm…

16:03.172 --> 16:04.715
full of life.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.593
My first step on Mars?
How would I describe it?

16:07.676 --> 16:08.969
Commander Poole and I,

16:09.052 --> 16:10.137
we opened the hatch.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.932
And I looked back and saw
Commander Kuznetsov a few steps behind me.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.477
Because humanity's future
belongs to the stars.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.313
I'm sorry.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.898
Start over. Delete that.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.525
Mars, he's like…

16:24.443 --> 16:25.694
a ghost.

16:25.777 --> 16:26.987
Stop laughing.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.364
I've never done this before.

16:29.448 --> 16:33.202
You know, in Soviet Union,
answers are given to you before interview.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.038
What's it like?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.877
Everything's new in a way.

16:42.711 --> 16:43.795
Haunting…

16:43.879 --> 16:46.131
What happens if you go off script?

16:48.926 --> 16:51.011
Boom. There I was on the ground first.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.387
Boom.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.224
I was on the ground. First.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.391
Pure…

16:57.476 --> 17:00.896
but ancient at the same time.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.232
Lonely.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.442
Just speak from your heart.

17:05.526 --> 17:06.944
You have beautiful voice.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.823
You can't really understand it
until you're here,

17:11.906 --> 17:15.327
but something about this place

17:16.286 --> 17:18.914
really changes your perspective on things.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.709
When you're here, it…

17:24.502 --> 17:26.128
feels like anything is possible.

17:30.592 --> 17:31.593
Anything is--

17:33.262 --> 17:34.847
Anything's possible.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.773
You know, growing up in Detroit,

17:46.483 --> 17:48.610
there weren't a lot of kids like me.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.740
Back then, especially
in the neighborhood I grew up in…

17:55.659 --> 18:00.080
you just didn't tell people you were gay.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.549
You cannot just walk into Ms. Madison's
office without an appointment. Sir!

18:10.632 --> 18:11.925
-Have you seen the news today?
-Sorry.

18:12.009 --> 18:12.968
Not yet.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.762
Well, it's a real you-know-what-burger.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.351
Tyler, in his sixth year with NASA,

18:21.435 --> 18:24.271
has just announced
that he is a homosexual.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.647
Oh, God.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.150
-But it gets worse.
-How could it possibly?

18:28.233 --> 18:31.278
-While, so far, NASA has remained silent…
-He's still in the army.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.030
…making it unclear if the agency

18:33.113 --> 18:35.574
was aware of Major Tyler's
sexual orientation.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.326
What the fuck was he thinking?

18:37.409 --> 18:38.911
This can't be happening.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.662
Three weeks, we're on Mars.

18:40.746 --> 18:41.955
Three goddamn weeks.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.498
The greatest moment in human history,

18:43.582 --> 18:46.335
and all the media is gonna talk about
is Will fucking Tyler?

18:50.631 --> 18:52.966
-The vice president is here.
-Send him in.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.515
I am sorry about this, Madam President.

19:00.432 --> 19:05.062
It's a shame that man put this stain
on your great accomplishment.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.065
Chairman Bradford,
where does the Pentagon stand on this?

19:08.148 --> 19:09.858
He is still active-duty military.

19:09.942 --> 19:14.071
Our policy is that active-duty soldiers
who are found to be homosexuals

19:14.154 --> 19:15.447
are dishonorably discharged.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.074
Pretty cut-and-dried.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.244
Except for the fact that he's on Mars
for the next two years.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.540
This young man decided
he wanted to make a statement.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.836
Well, then I say
we make a statement out of him.

19:28.919 --> 19:32.089
The American people are crystal clear
on this.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.800
Seventy-three percent
of people polled last year said

19:34.883 --> 19:36.969
that homosexuality is wrong.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.765
Children look up to astronauts.
They're supposed to be role models.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.394
I'm telling you, Madam President,
if we show weakness here, w--

19:45.477 --> 19:48.355
I'm not showing weakness.
I'm considering all my options.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.066
This puts us in a tough spot here,
in terms of the jobs bill.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.985
We finally got the support
of enough moderates--

19:53.068 --> 19:56.071
We're talking about
the sanctity of the military

19:56.154 --> 19:59.283
and the future of this country!

20:07.374 --> 20:08.917
I apologize for raising my voice,

20:10.085 --> 20:12.171
but with all due respect, Madam President,

20:12.254 --> 20:14.840
if you don't take a firm stand on this,

20:15.591 --> 20:19.970
your jobs bill will lose
at least 50 Republicans.

20:21.388 --> 20:25.809
If we don't show America
that we are in control up there,

20:26.935 --> 20:32.441
I guarantee you
the Dems will clean our clock come '96.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.780
Thank you. That'll be all.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.884
Graham made a statement
calling for Tyler's discharge.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.805
And even Lieberman is saying
if we don't change the policy,

21:04.681 --> 21:05.807
we're cowards.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.318
This has gotten way out of hand.

21:16.401 --> 21:20.197
There is a whole world of shit
that's about to come down on you,

21:20.280 --> 21:21.990
and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

21:22.074 --> 21:24.326
I know. That's my problem.

21:24.409 --> 21:28.455
No, it's the mission's problem,
which now makes it my problem.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.752
I just don't understand why
you couldn't have waited till we got back.

21:33.836 --> 21:36.004
I waited my entire life.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.422
I'm done lying about who I am.

21:37.506 --> 21:39.508
I get that, Will. Really, I do.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.176
Do you?

21:42.845 --> 21:43.929
What's that supposed to mean?

21:45.013 --> 21:48.058
Look, for all I know, you're sitting there
thinking I'm some kind of heathen.

21:48.141 --> 21:53.063
Oh, come on.
That-- That is way out of line.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.108
But God made the Garden of Eden
out of a desert, right?

21:57.234 --> 21:59.319
A blank slate just like this one.

22:00.279 --> 22:03.907
I was standing out there
looking at a new world, untouched.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.117
And I thought,

22:06.535 --> 22:09.788
"What if this is our chance
to plant a new tree of knowledge?

22:09.872 --> 22:10.873
To start again."

22:10.956 --> 22:13.500
Who's to say, here,
a hundred million miles from Earth,

22:13.584 --> 22:14.835
what's a sin and what's not?

22:14.918 --> 22:16.879
This is not about God.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.797
This is about NASA.

22:18.881 --> 22:21.717
If you have a problem,
you run it up the chain of command.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.554
You don't just blurt it out on national TV
like you're on Sally Jessy Raphael.

22:25.637 --> 22:29.766
You have no idea what it's like to live
with a secret like this your entire life,

22:30.642 --> 22:32.978
to know that if people found out
who you really are--

22:33.061 --> 22:34.354
They'd what?

22:34.438 --> 22:38.358
They'd judge you just for living
in the skin that you were born in.

22:39.568 --> 22:40.611
Come on, Will.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.363
I have been in this program
for more than 20 years,

22:43.447 --> 22:48.702
and not one second has gone by
that I am not aware of how they see us.

22:50.454 --> 22:53.457
So don't you stand there and tell me
that I don't know what it's like.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.503
Being gay is different than being Black.

22:57.586 --> 22:59.588
Yeah, you're right.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.215
At least you have the luxury of hiding it.

23:02.341 --> 23:03.342
The luxury?

23:09.097 --> 23:11.183
-You know what I mean.
-Actually, I don't.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.520
Last time I checked,

23:14.603 --> 23:18.273
reconstructing the moral fabric
of the universe was not our mission.

23:18.357 --> 23:22.027
Our mission is to create
a sustainable base here and survive.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.364
Okay, but what does that even mean,
"survive"? If we're going--

23:25.447 --> 23:28.116
It means stop thinking about yourself

23:28.200 --> 23:30.827
and go fix the fucking
thermal control units.

23:34.831 --> 23:35.832
Now.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.415
-Welcome to Helios, Lenara.
-Thank you.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.500
And of course,
you know our COO, Karen Baldwin.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.002
-Of course.
-Great to see you again.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.420
Pleasure.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.005
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.681
This is incredible.

24:34.266 --> 24:37.811
Looks like a reservoir the size
of Lake Tahoe beneath the surface.

24:37.895 --> 24:40.272
That could sustain
a Mars colony bigger than Houston.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.942
To get to the site,
it would require flight transport,

24:44.026 --> 24:45.861
something that NASA does not have

24:45.944 --> 24:48.822
now that Sojourner is no longer
able to launch.

24:48.906 --> 24:53.577
So we would like to pay your company a fee
to use your MSAM to fly to the site

24:53.660 --> 24:56.371
and one of your drills
to extract the water.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.957
Where is the reservoir located?

25:00.876 --> 25:03.879
I'm sorry. At this time,
we are not at liberty to divulge.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.092
You want to use our MSAM
to get to the water,

25:09.176 --> 25:11.553
one of our drills to extract the water,
but you don't wanna tell us

25:11.637 --> 25:14.848
-where the water is?
-Once we agree on the fee, Dev,

25:14.932 --> 25:18.227
we will obviously provide
necessary information.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.271
Okay.

25:23.232 --> 25:24.775
How's 50% for a fee?

25:25.817 --> 25:26.818
50% of what?

25:26.902 --> 25:30.072
We want 50% of all water extracted
from the reservoir.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.411
No, absolutely not.

25:36.495 --> 25:37.496
Then we have no deal.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.166
You have to understand.
This was our discovery.

25:41.250 --> 25:45.629
Currently, our MSAM is assigned
to refueling the Phoenix.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.923
So if you want us
to adjust our mission plan

25:48.006 --> 25:51.593
and use our time and our resources,
we want 50%.

26:10.988 --> 26:12.489
Hey! Kuz!

26:12.573 --> 26:14.575
My name is not Kuz.

26:14.658 --> 26:15.784
What's this I hear

26:15.868 --> 26:18.579
about some kind of joint mission
you guys are doing with Helios tomorrow?

26:18.662 --> 26:19.997
It does not concern you.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.833
Does not concern me?
You're living under my roof,

26:22.916 --> 26:25.127
eating my food,
drinking what little water I got.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.087
You wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for us. Hey.

26:28.088 --> 26:30.048
And so this means we are now, what?

26:30.132 --> 26:32.176
Your property? You control us?

26:32.259 --> 26:35.220
Oh, come on. Don't give me that crap.
You owe me an answer.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.222
We owe you nothing.

26:49.443 --> 26:51.361
What's the matter? You okay?

26:51.445 --> 26:52.863
Yeah, just got a headache.

26:52.946 --> 26:56.366
Thermal controls are on the fritz,
and it's about a million degrees in here.

26:56.450 --> 26:59.995
It sounds like someone regrets
not hitching a ride with their old man.

27:00.078 --> 27:05.125
Once we get the temperature fixed,
and the water, and the CDRA…

27:06.001 --> 27:08.795
You're having trouble
with your carbon dioxide scrubbers too?

27:08.879 --> 27:11.173
Yeah, CO2 levels are a little high.

27:12.549 --> 27:15.719
Some people have been feeling
a bit light-headed, that's all.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.931
Kel, that's not good.

27:19.014 --> 27:21.099
I don't want you to worry, all right?

27:21.183 --> 27:25.395
Our hab's just been having a lot
of technical issues since we got here.

27:26.563 --> 27:29.900
I guess that's what we get for going
two years before we were supposed to.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.069
Listen, I'm gonna see you pretty soon.

27:32.653 --> 27:38.951
Helios has made arrangements
for some joint research with the Soviets.

27:39.785 --> 27:40.994
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:41.787 --> 27:42.955
What kind of research?

27:48.085 --> 27:49.127
Can't tell you.

27:50.879 --> 27:52.130
Seriously?

27:52.214 --> 27:53.590
You're my daughter,

27:54.383 --> 27:58.053
but you're still working
for the other guy, so…

28:00.973 --> 28:01.974
Okay.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.520
I guess I'll see you soon.

28:08.814 --> 28:09.898
I can't wait.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.735
I love you, Kel. Always.

28:14.736 --> 28:15.737
Always.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.959
-Got you, little bastard.
-What is it?

28:29.042 --> 28:30.836
Cooling loop blockage.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.338
The valve might have been damaged
during the hab landing,

28:33.422 --> 28:35.549
and I am gonna need to replace this. Here.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.010
Hold this. Here, buddy.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.221
Thank you.

28:43.015 --> 28:44.766
Could you help me drain the fluid?

28:50.772 --> 28:52.357
Come on. I need two hands in here.

28:54.067 --> 28:57.738
We have to go out
and check the cooling pump first.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.949
The pump? Why?
I'm telling you it's a bad valve.

29:01.033 --> 29:04.119
Well, if the pump is malfunctioning,
it could have damaged the valve.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.997
Okay, but we're still gonna
need to replace this.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.081
Yeah.

29:09.416 --> 29:10.876
Hey, what's up with you, man?

29:13.212 --> 29:14.213
Nothing.

29:15.172 --> 29:18.550
I'm just sick of you Americans
always looking for fucking shortcuts.

29:25.933 --> 29:29.478
Reassigned? You trained with Will
for two years on HAB SYS,

29:29.561 --> 29:31.688
and there's nobody else here
qualified to do your job.

29:31.772 --> 29:33.690
Well, I'm concerned for my own health.

29:34.775 --> 29:35.776
What?

29:37.319 --> 29:38.737
Oh, come on.

29:40.364 --> 29:42.032
It has not crossed your mind?

29:42.533 --> 29:45.744
We were all given an HIV test
before launch. You know that.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.873
Two weeks prior.
Anything could have happened in between.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.500
That's very unlikely.

29:52.376 --> 29:54.795
Radiation weakens immune system.

29:55.379 --> 29:58.465
If we have been exposed
to the immunodeficiency virus up here,

30:00.217 --> 30:04.137
our chances of survival
would be significantly less than on Earth.

30:04.221 --> 30:06.306
Believe me, if we're gonna die up here,

30:06.390 --> 30:08.183
it's because we never got
the damn base online,

30:08.267 --> 30:09.768
not because of Will Tyler.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.270
-Hear me--
-Hey.

31:48.617 --> 31:49.993
Hey, Danny.

31:51.036 --> 31:52.454
-Hey, Ed.
-Come here.

31:53.205 --> 31:55.666
I want to talk to you
before I head over to NASA.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.044
How's your hand?

31:59.127 --> 32:00.128
It's okay.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.300
Yeah, I wanna talk to you about--

32:06.635 --> 32:08.512
about what was said before.

32:10.639 --> 32:12.224
Look, I'm sorry, sir.

32:12.307 --> 32:13.934
-I was way out of line.
-No.

32:15.102 --> 32:17.563
No, you were right.

32:19.189 --> 32:22.317
I guess I'm just trying to protect you,

32:23.443 --> 32:24.736
but that's not fair.

32:24.820 --> 32:27.656
You're a grown man, a qualified astronaut.

32:29.241 --> 32:30.242
Thank you, sir.

32:30.325 --> 32:31.702
And I'm sure you're not too happy

32:31.785 --> 32:34.621
about being transferred back up
to the Phoenix because of that injury.

32:36.206 --> 32:37.332
So…

32:39.793 --> 32:43.589
I'm changing the medical protocols.
How's that sound?

32:43.672 --> 32:44.882
Roger that.

32:45.757 --> 32:48.051
I'll be back tomorrow
before the first run with the Russians,

32:48.135 --> 32:50.971
and we'll talk more about it then, okay?

32:51.054 --> 32:52.931
-Yes, sir.
-All right, good man.

33:19.958 --> 33:23.212
Wait, do you think they can hear us?

33:49.446 --> 33:51.615
I am looking forward
to meeting your father.

33:53.951 --> 33:55.827
In Russia, he's very famous.

33:55.911 --> 33:57.955
Yeah, about that.

33:58.038 --> 34:01.416
We should get something straight
before he gets here.

34:02.376 --> 34:04.002
He can't know about this.

34:05.754 --> 34:06.755
Why not?

34:06.839 --> 34:09.341
Let's just say, if he found out,
he'd probably murder you.

34:10.759 --> 34:12.761
Shove you out an air lock
in the middle of the night

34:12.844 --> 34:14.179
and make it look like an accident.

34:14.263 --> 34:16.473
So, if he asks, you don't even know me.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.518
Okay.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.980
And what's this thing
he's coming over here for anyway?

34:23.772 --> 34:27.109
Commander Poole says you guys and Helios
made some sort of arrangement?

34:28.277 --> 34:29.570
I cannot say.

34:32.114 --> 34:34.408
Why, you think I'm gonna run
and tell Margo Madison?

34:34.491 --> 34:36.659
No, I just-- I cannot say.

34:40.205 --> 34:41.456
You don't trust me.

34:43.792 --> 34:44.918
It's not that.

34:45.002 --> 34:48.338
I… I cannot say.

34:48.422 --> 34:50.507
Got it. Cool, thanks.

36:22.349 --> 36:23.475
Hi, Bob.

36:24.393 --> 36:25.394
Hi, Bob.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.984
You are Bob?

36:33.151 --> 36:36.488
-I thought you are…
-No. It's just an inside joke.

36:36.572 --> 36:38.907
-Joke.
-Yes, joke.

36:38.991 --> 36:41.702
I am Commander Grigory Kuznetsov.

36:42.911 --> 36:43.912
Ed Baldwin.

36:45.205 --> 36:46.915
-Dad.
-Kiddo.

36:51.336 --> 36:52.462
Kiddo.

36:56.341 --> 36:58.343
A little birdie told me
you've been having some trouble

36:58.427 --> 37:00.179
with your carbon dioxide scrubbers.

37:01.555 --> 37:04.600
-That's why I brought some spares.
-Thanks, Ed.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.269
That's not all.

37:13.192 --> 37:14.568
You certainly came prepared.

37:14.651 --> 37:17.070
Well, I figured,
what's the point of having all this

37:17.154 --> 37:19.907
if I can't share it with those in need,
am I right?

37:19.990 --> 37:21.658
Goat cheese garlic toast?

37:22.409 --> 37:25.454
Marinated rack of lamb
with mint vinaigrette!

37:26.163 --> 37:28.081
Chocolate molten lava cake!

37:28.165 --> 37:30.667
I guess you can call this
the first Martian Thanksgiving.

37:30.751 --> 37:32.419
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

37:41.845 --> 37:43.972
Now that we're all here,
I'd like to propose a toast.

37:47.476 --> 37:50.896
Congratulations, Dani.
That was some damn good flying.

37:50.979 --> 37:51.980
Thanks, Ed.

37:52.523 --> 37:56.944
Even if I was the only one who managed
to get down to the surface intact.

37:57.027 --> 37:59.071
And you'd still trade places with me
in a heartbeat.

37:59.154 --> 38:00.280
You got that right.

38:00.822 --> 38:01.823
To a race well run.

38:02.616 --> 38:03.909
To our new home.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.077
And to our ride back.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.712
That might be
the best damn vodka I've ever had.

38:15.796 --> 38:19.174
From Koltsovo, Siberia.
It's the best in all of Soviet Russia.

38:19.258 --> 38:21.301
Yeah, look at that. Come on. Get in there.

38:21.969 --> 38:23.637
Before these vultures eat it all.

38:31.436 --> 38:34.565
Hey, I don't think we've met.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.067
Ed Baldwin.

38:37.693 --> 38:39.528
Alexei. Nice to meet you, sir.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.822
So, how do you like
working with my daughter?

38:41.905 --> 38:43.115
Who?

38:43.615 --> 38:45.617
Kelly, my daughter.

38:47.911 --> 38:50.205
The girl, yes. She's nice.

38:50.831 --> 38:51.832
The girl?

38:52.583 --> 38:55.460
You mean you've been in a confined space
with my daughter over four weeks

38:55.544 --> 38:56.962
and haven't bothered to learn her name?

38:57.045 --> 39:00.090
I-- It is, a--

39:00.174 --> 39:01.425
Goddamn Russians.

39:10.601 --> 39:13.854
You know, growing up in Detroit,

39:15.564 --> 39:17.691
there weren't a lot of kids like me.

39:19.735 --> 39:23.155
Back then, especially
in the neighborhood I grew up in,

39:24.656 --> 39:29.411
you just didn't tell people you were gay.

39:33.707 --> 39:34.708
It was hard.

39:35.709 --> 39:37.419
I got bullied a lot.

39:40.047 --> 39:44.301
And there were days
where I felt like I didn't want to go on…

39:46.345 --> 39:48.847
like maybe the world was better off
without me in it.

39:53.101 --> 39:54.728
But I did go on,

39:55.729 --> 39:57.231
and now here I am.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.399
The first gay man on Mars.

40:01.485 --> 40:06.949
So, if you're a kid out there that feels
like maybe you're broken somehow,

40:07.032 --> 40:10.285
like the world would be better off
without you in it…

40:12.120 --> 40:15.791
I promise you,
it's the world that's broken, not you.

40:17.209 --> 40:18.752
Now, I know there's probably gonna be

40:18.836 --> 40:23.090
a lot of people out there mad at me
for saying this, but-- I don't know.

40:23.924 --> 40:27.177
I just feel like, if somebody like me
doesn't say it, who will?

40:28.929 --> 40:31.849
What's the point of sending people
all the way out here,

40:32.808 --> 40:36.979
if we can't look back on our own world
and see it for what it could be?

40:49.157 --> 40:52.035
They said someone defaced
his mother's house in Detroit.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.122
That's awful.

40:59.293 --> 41:05.174
We made so much progress on so many things
and here we are.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.259
I hate that this is happening to him too…

41:09.428 --> 41:14.308
but the truth is he put himself,
and us, in this impossible situation.

41:14.391 --> 41:16.310
We just lost seats in the midterms.

41:16.977 --> 41:18.604
The jobs bill is hanging by a thread.

41:18.687 --> 41:21.607
And if you want any shot
at getting reelected,

41:21.690 --> 41:23.525
you can't touch this with a ten-foot pole.

41:24.693 --> 41:27.112
We have to find a way
to change the narrative here.

41:29.031 --> 41:30.616
What is the point…

41:33.410 --> 41:34.536
of being here?

41:35.287 --> 41:36.580
-I can't even--
-Ellen, Ellen.

41:36.663 --> 41:38.540
He should be allowed to serve his country!

41:38.624 --> 41:42.169
I agree,
but things can't just change on a dime.

41:43.462 --> 41:46.131
The country's not ready for that, El,
and you know it,

41:46.924 --> 41:48.050
better than anyone.

41:54.056 --> 41:55.057
I--

41:56.558 --> 41:57.559
I never--

41:59.061 --> 42:03.357
I never told you this, but on Apollo 24,

42:03.440 --> 42:06.235
when things were looking pretty bleak, I--

42:08.737 --> 42:10.489
I told Deke Slayton…

42:12.032 --> 42:14.326
about Pam, about everything.

42:17.913 --> 42:20.582
-Wow.
-I'll never forget the look on his face.

42:23.085 --> 42:28.841
It wasn't anger or even disgust.
It was just…

42:33.387 --> 42:34.596
disappointment.

42:40.227 --> 42:45.148
He said, "Never tell anybody else.
It's all they'll see."

42:45.232 --> 42:46.567
I'm sorry, El. That's…

42:49.403 --> 42:52.823
No, in his own way,
he was just trying to help.

42:54.283 --> 42:55.576
He knew the price I'd pay--

42:55.659 --> 42:58.662
-Wait. Wait a second.
-What?

42:59.538 --> 43:02.207
There's a professor at Northwestern
that did a paper on this.

43:03.041 --> 43:05.836
Right now,
members of the military can be discharged

43:05.919 --> 43:10.215
-if they admit to being gay, right?
-Right.

43:10.299 --> 43:14.595
But what if the question
isn't allowed to be asked?

43:23.896 --> 43:26.023
Well, then they could serve
their country with--

43:26.106 --> 43:27.274
From now on, we don't ask.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.527
We don't pursue. We don't investigate.

43:34.323 --> 43:35.866
The Joint Chiefs will never go for it.

43:35.949 --> 43:37.618
Well, you're the commander in chief.

43:38.243 --> 43:40.579
Even so, it'll go too far
for the Republicans

43:40.662 --> 43:44.333
-and not far enough for the Democrats.
-The perfect compromise.

43:49.087 --> 43:51.173
Piss off both sides
and control the argument.

43:55.594 --> 43:57.596
-Tom would've loved it.
-Exactly.

43:57.679 --> 44:01.099
It could be the first step
to real progress.

44:01.183 --> 44:02.267
A baby step,

44:02.351 --> 44:07.105
but it would put a stop to the
endless investigations, the harassment--

44:07.189 --> 44:08.732
And you can do it by executive order.

44:09.650 --> 44:11.109
And put the focus back on Mars.

44:11.818 --> 44:12.819
Right.

44:16.698 --> 44:17.699
But what a--

44:20.452 --> 44:21.787
What about Will Tyler?

44:23.205 --> 44:24.873
It wouldn't change a thing for him.

44:25.999 --> 44:27.751
No, it wouldn't.

44:47.479 --> 44:49.815
-Come in, Sergei.
-Thank you.

44:51.733 --> 44:54.695
I have brought you another request
from Director Catiche.

44:54.778 --> 44:56.446
More satellite photography.

44:58.657 --> 45:01.660
Does this have something to do
with this mysterious joint mission

45:01.743 --> 45:03.954
y'all are doing with Helios tomorrow?

45:04.037 --> 45:08.000
I don't know.
They never tell me much these days.

45:09.585 --> 45:10.586
Thank you.

45:14.840 --> 45:15.841
Do you mind?

45:29.938 --> 45:31.190
You have a lovely collection.

45:32.983 --> 45:33.984
Thank you.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.328
I love this one.

45:48.790 --> 45:52.753
The last track on the B side
in particular is--

45:53.962 --> 45:54.963
is wonderful.

45:56.882 --> 45:58.926
-Would I be able to--
-Of course.

46:01.386 --> 46:03.305
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, no.

46:03.388 --> 46:06.558
Nuri, do you have any napkins or tissues

46:06.642 --> 46:08.435
-or--
-Yes, ma'am.

46:08.519 --> 46:09.645
Yeah, that works. Thanks.

46:12.981 --> 46:15.943
-I'm so sorry. I-- I've--
-Hey, it's okay.

46:17.319 --> 46:20.864
I've made a mess
of your lovely office. I'm so sorry.

46:21.448 --> 46:22.699
I should go.

46:22.783 --> 46:24.952
It's getting late.

46:27.663 --> 46:28.664
Okay.

46:47.516 --> 46:48.517
Good night.

47:31.351 --> 47:34.438
Liquid water? They've been
holding out on us this whole time?

47:34.521 --> 47:35.856
What did I tell you?

47:36.565 --> 47:38.650
-We cannot trust them.
-Keep it down.

47:38.734 --> 47:40.986
Fuck them. I want them to hear this.

47:42.112 --> 47:43.238
They're up to no good.

47:43.947 --> 47:46.950
We should get them out of this building
before they do any more damage.

47:47.034 --> 47:48.785
-They shouldn't be here.
-Where are you going?

47:48.869 --> 47:50.537
To go tell Commander Poole the news.

47:50.621 --> 47:52.456
She should know
there are rats in her base.

48:08.263 --> 48:10.098
-Uh-huh.
-You're so funny.

48:19.358 --> 48:20.734
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

48:21.318 --> 48:25.072
In Russia,
it is said that Ivan the Fearsome,

48:25.656 --> 48:29.785
who was a terrible person,
would throw these great parties.

48:31.203 --> 48:35.958
But he would become enraged
when it was time for the guests to leave.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.129
So, to keep them to stay,
he proposed ten toasts.

48:42.422 --> 48:45.884
I know we're in short supply here,
so we'll have to share, huh?

48:45.968 --> 48:47.010
-All right.
-Okay.

48:47.094 --> 48:48.095
Here we go.

48:49.179 --> 48:50.180
Ten?

48:54.309 --> 48:55.894
Zastolnaya!

48:55.978 --> 48:57.896
Zastolnaya!

48:57.980 --> 49:01.817
A sign of respect
for those who stay at the feast.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.610
Uh-huh. Bring it.

49:04.278 --> 49:05.445
They found water.

49:05.529 --> 49:07.739
-Liquid water, underground.
-There it is.

49:07.823 --> 49:10.075
And the Russians
have known about it for months.

49:12.369 --> 49:14.913
-It makes no sense to me whatsoever.
-None.

49:14.997 --> 49:15.998
All right.

49:16.957 --> 49:19.501
All right. All right. Here we go.

49:19.585 --> 49:21.170
We're going in.

49:21.253 --> 49:23.964
-…the location of the deposit, but…
-Number two.

49:24.047 --> 49:25.090
Podyemnaya!

49:25.174 --> 49:27.634
Podyemnaya!

49:27.718 --> 49:30.596
For those who decide to leave the table.

49:36.226 --> 49:37.853
Ready for number three.

49:42.900 --> 49:46.862
Zavorotnaya!

49:46.945 --> 49:50.115
Zavorotnaya!

49:50.199 --> 49:52.701
For those who managed to leave the gate.

49:52.784 --> 49:53.869
I wish that was me.

49:53.952 --> 49:55.954
Not our gate. Yeah.

50:00.667 --> 50:03.545
That went down bad.

50:03.629 --> 50:04.671
Here you go, dude.

50:04.755 --> 50:08.133
Number four.
I'm sorry, but get ready. Number four.

50:09.009 --> 50:10.093
Dad.

50:10.177 --> 50:12.095
Since when does a Russian say no to vodka?

50:12.179 --> 50:13.972
-I'm good.
-He's not gonna like this one.

50:14.056 --> 50:16.141
But I think Dimitri needs another.

50:17.309 --> 50:18.393
All right.

50:19.811 --> 50:21.146
Hey, what is it?

50:22.564 --> 50:24.149
I don't want any more vodka.

50:24.233 --> 50:26.151
Please just say it, Rolan.

50:27.277 --> 50:29.488
Just say it. To my face.

50:30.322 --> 50:31.615
Go on. Be a man about it.

50:31.698 --> 50:33.909
-Will, Will, look--
-I said, go on!

50:44.336 --> 50:45.838
You should have told me.

50:45.921 --> 50:47.673
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it was your business.

50:47.756 --> 50:50.467
It's just the business
of the whole world, apparently.

50:50.551 --> 50:52.094
-There it is.
-Yeah, that's right.

50:52.177 --> 50:53.470
I had the right to know.

50:53.554 --> 50:56.932
I am the one who racks with you,
who works with you.

50:57.891 --> 51:00.477
-I thought you were like my brother, man.
-No, you're not my brother!

51:00.561 --> 51:01.979
You're a fucking liar!

51:03.897 --> 51:05.232
Hey!

51:06.483 --> 51:07.484
Hey!

51:08.735 --> 51:10.654
Damn it! Hey!

51:10.737 --> 51:11.738
Hey!

51:13.323 --> 51:14.449
Are you okay?

51:14.533 --> 51:17.035
Enough! Enough.

51:24.126 --> 51:25.419
What's so funny?

51:25.919 --> 51:28.839
You Americans, you have no discipline.

51:29.339 --> 51:31.091
Us Americans, huh?

51:33.010 --> 51:35.596
You don't seem to have an issue
with that American.

51:37.556 --> 51:39.391
-Dani, wh--
-No, no.

51:40.225 --> 51:41.351
It's my turn to speak.

51:42.811 --> 51:44.438
I know what y'all are up to now.

51:45.814 --> 51:47.900
Liquid water, huh?

51:51.695 --> 51:53.614
-What?
-That's right, Kel.

51:54.698 --> 51:55.908
They found the jackpot,

51:56.533 --> 51:59.661
and now they're just gonna leave us
back here hanging in the dust.

52:07.419 --> 52:11.840
Well, let's toast
to a beautiful new partnership,

52:12.716 --> 52:15.010
the Soviet Union and Helios.

52:15.093 --> 52:18.555
Communism and capitalism.
A match made in heaven.

52:21.099 --> 52:23.560
Come on, Dani. Come on.

52:23.644 --> 52:25.854
You have got to be kidding me.

52:25.938 --> 52:28.398
After every single thing that you and I
have been through.

52:34.988 --> 52:36.073
Hold on--

53:01.098 --> 53:03.141
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

53:03.225 --> 53:06.270
but I had to sign one of those
confidentiality agreements,

53:06.353 --> 53:07.479
if you can believe that.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.773
Talk about corporate bullshit.

53:13.610 --> 53:17.364
-So, liquid water?
-Yeah.

53:20.409 --> 53:22.077
If the Russians' readings are correct,

53:22.160 --> 53:25.873
this is the resource that can support
large-scale human colonization.

53:25.956 --> 53:28.333
Dad, this is so much more than that.

53:29.626 --> 53:32.629
If life is anywhere on this planet,
it's in water.

53:33.422 --> 53:37.509
Well, life can't exist without sunlight,
without photosynthesis.

53:37.593 --> 53:41.054
Like when me and my team found life
under a glacier in Antarctica

53:41.138 --> 53:42.598
under the exact same conditions.

53:42.681 --> 53:43.891
This is different.

53:43.974 --> 53:44.975
Yeah.

53:45.934 --> 53:47.019
It's much bigger.

53:48.437 --> 53:51.273
We're talking about discovering life
on another planet.

53:51.356 --> 53:55.777
It'll change our concept of who we are,
where we came from, where we're going.

53:56.945 --> 53:59.239
Well, you know,
unless you guys kill it first, then--

53:59.323 --> 54:03.493
We'll see to it that we make all the
appropriate tests on the initial sample.

54:04.036 --> 54:06.914
We're gonna make sure nothing's in there
before we start collecting water.

54:06.997 --> 54:08.957
I need to see those samples.

54:09.041 --> 54:11.585
My equipment is more sensitive
than what you or the Russians have,

54:11.668 --> 54:14.838
and-- It's not just that.
Okay, I need to be a part of this.

54:14.922 --> 54:17.216
Okay. Okay.

54:20.052 --> 54:22.387
You win. Again.

54:22.471 --> 54:23.889
I'll see what I can do.

54:26.391 --> 54:27.392
Thanks, Dad.

54:31.855 --> 54:33.482
Things are moving along up here.

54:33.565 --> 54:36.818
We're getting ready to take the Russians
up on the ridge above Melas Chasma,

54:36.902 --> 54:38.904
and--
It's gonna be so good to see Kel.

54:38.987 --> 54:41.949
I can't believe we're together
on another planet

54:42.032 --> 54:43.992
and I still haven't seen her yet.

54:45.035 --> 54:48.956
Anyways, Karen,
that's not why I'm sending this.

54:49.831 --> 54:51.708
There's something I wanted to mention.

54:54.795 --> 54:56.839
I'm starting to get worried about Danny.

54:58.048 --> 55:00.801
He's been off for a while.

55:01.844 --> 55:03.220
He's not focused.

55:03.303 --> 55:05.597
He's erratic, short-tempered…

55:06.598 --> 55:09.977
I saw it with Gordo back in '74.

55:12.771 --> 55:14.731
It's hard to explain, and I--

55:14.815 --> 55:17.860
and I keep thinking about
what Danielle said before we left.

55:19.570 --> 55:22.573
I'm wondering if it was maybe a mistake
to bring him up here.

55:25.117 --> 55:27.119
He's just-- I mean, she's right.

55:29.496 --> 55:32.791
I don't think he's cut out for this.
Anyway, I--

55:53.896 --> 55:54.938
Good afternoon.

55:57.566 --> 56:01.361
I will be issuing an executive order
prohibiting military personnel

56:01.445 --> 56:03.739
from attempting to discover
the sexual orientation

56:03.822 --> 56:05.490
of any other service member.

56:07.284 --> 56:09.745
The order will also prohibit
any gay members

56:09.828 --> 56:13.540
of the United States Armed Forces
from disclosing their sexual orientation.

56:14.082 --> 56:18.253
And it will forbid openly gay persons
from serving in the military.

56:18.337 --> 56:19.922
Madam President? Madam President?

56:24.009 --> 56:25.219
Madam President,

56:25.302 --> 56:28.055
how does this decision
impact the status of astronaut Will Tyler?

56:29.806 --> 56:33.685
Major Tyler has served his country
with distinction and honor,

56:34.811 --> 56:38.941
but his actions are a violation of current
Department of Defense regulations,

56:39.024 --> 56:41.860
and he will be discharged from the Army
upon his return.

57:19.231 --> 57:23.443
Meanwhile in Washington,
the Wilson administration's new policy,

57:23.527 --> 57:26.613
which is being called
the Uniform First Act,

57:26.697 --> 57:30.158
has been attacked
from both the left and the right.

57:30.242 --> 57:33.412
The executive order was branded
a "capitulation to immorality"

57:33.495 --> 57:35.163
by conservative leaders,

57:35.247 --> 57:39.585
while Democrats called the administration
"anti-gay and oppressive."

57:39.668 --> 57:43.005
California representative Barbara Boxer
expressed disapproval for the measure…

57:43.088 --> 57:44.381
Sorry I'm late.

57:44.464 --> 57:49.136
…saying that although her 1991 push
for the Military Freedom Act failed…

57:49.219 --> 57:50.596
What's up with you?

57:51.180 --> 57:55.267
…to fix a wrong, unlike Wilson's
"weak, toothless executive action"…

57:55.350 --> 57:57.311
-That.
-…which she accused of propagating…

57:57.394 --> 58:00.105
-…a culture of shame and injustice.
-"Uniform First"?

58:00.189 --> 58:03.233
Why don't they just call it
what it really is, "gays last"?

58:03.317 --> 58:08.071
…even within Canada, where lesbians, gays
and bisexuals have been allowed to serve…

58:09.448 --> 58:13.869
The worst part is, he actually sounded
like he thinks it's a good idea.

58:13.952 --> 58:15.037
Of course, he does.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.873
I bet you a million bucks it was his idea.

58:21.668 --> 58:24.421
Look, I know you're having fun
with the guy,

58:24.505 --> 58:26.840
but he's married
to the most powerful woman in the world.

58:26.924 --> 58:29.218
-I don't know what you thought was--
-Are you crazy?

58:29.301 --> 58:30.385
Nobody's listening.

58:30.469 --> 58:32.721
It's D.C. Literally everyone is listening.

58:34.306 --> 58:36.016
God, I never should have told you.

58:37.392 --> 58:39.353
-So have you done it in the Oval yet?
-No.

58:44.441 --> 58:46.026
Okay, once.

58:50.405 --> 58:52.282
Oh, my God.

58:53.116 --> 58:55.911
I'm sorry, I'm just imagining
the look on Nixon's face right now.

59:00.582 --> 59:01.792
That would be something.

59:13.011 --> 59:13.971
Where to?

59:14.054 --> 59:15.013
Dupont Circle.

59:17.850 --> 59:19.142
Hey.

59:19.226 --> 59:21.854
You are not gonna believe
what I just heard from Jeremy Zielke.

59:21.937 --> 59:22.938
Are you around?

59:23.814 --> 59:25.607
No, no. I gotta tell you in person.

59:26.483 --> 59:27.901
Okay, I'm on my way.
