11:49.917 --> 11:52.920
YOU'RE OFF MODELED,

11:53.003 --> 11:55.297
REMEMBER, OUT THERE IN TV LAND

WAIT TILL SATURDAY.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.690
{\an1}YOU'VE BEEN TRAINING LIKE
A MADMAN FOR THIS COMPETITION.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.527
{\an5}I'M RARING TO GO,
I GOT MY EYE
ON THE PRIZE.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.155
THINK WE CAN GET
MORE TRAINING IN?

13:01.238 --> 13:05.075
{\an1}I THOUGHT I'D TRAIN TO BE
A SPECTATOR A LITTLE LONGER.

HOW COULD YOU MISS HIM?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.670
HMM,

13:16.754 --> 13:20.257
LET ME GIVE SPUNKY
SOME SUPPER FIRST.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.760
HMM, LET'S SEE.

13:22.843 --> 13:27.014
HOW ABOUT A BIG BOWL
OF PUPPY NUGGETS?

13:30.851 --> 13:32.853
UM, ROCKO?

13:32.937 --> 13:34.021

13:45.533 --> 13:47.076
I'M SURE, HEFF. WHY?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.035
I DON'T KNOW, ROCK...

13:48.118 --> 13:52.248
LAST MONTH YOUR FIGURE EIGHTS
WERE PERFECT.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.083
THESE RECENT ONES ARE...

13:54.166 --> 13:57.336
{\an1}WELL, NOT UP
TO YOUR USUAL QUALITY.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.046
OH, HEFF, THAT'S NONSENSE.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.966

14:02.049 --> 14:02.925
I DON'T KNOW.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.927
YOU'RE MAKING TOO MUCH OF THIS.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.637
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.284
{\an1}GEE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ALMOST JACKED SPUNKY.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.326
GO TO THE DOCTOR.

14:29.410 --> 14:33.289
JACKHAMMERING CAN BE DANGEROUS
IF YOU CAN'T SEE.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.582
YOU'RE RIGHT, HEFF.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.125
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET MY EYES CHECKED.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.294
{\an1}ALL RIGHT

{\an1}WE BATS ARE SICK AND TIRED
OF THESE STEREOTYPES.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.395
WE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS
WITH THE VAMPIRE SHTICK

14:56.478 --> 14:59.565
WITHOUT BEING CLASSIFIED
AS VISUALLY IMPAIRED.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.733

15:08.407 --> 15:10.659
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE OPTOMETRIST.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.495
{\an1}YOUR EYESIGHT MUST BE BAD
IF YOU CAN'T...

15:13.579 --> 15:15.831
I'M RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

15:15.914 --> 15:19.627
{\an1}COME INTO THE BACK; WE'LL HAVE
A LOOK AT YOU RIGHT AWAY.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.046
LET'S START
WITH THE OLD EYE CHART

15:22.129 --> 15:23.172
SHALL WE?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.007
WAIT RIGHT HERE.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.011

15:29.094 --> 15:31.055

FORWARD.

15:31.138 --> 15:31.722
NO, I STILL CAN'T.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.932
TAKE ANOTHER
STEP FORWARD.

COMPETITION TONIGHT.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.788
HERE, HAVE A SEAT
IN THE CHAIR.

15:55.871 --> 15:59.041
FIRST, WE MUST DILATE
YOUR PUPILS.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.504
THERE. NOW, LET'S SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

(<i> circus music playing</i> )

16:22.231 --> 16:24.775
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

16:25.734 --> 16:28.987
THIS IS AN IMPRESSIVE MACHINE;
WHAT DOES IT DO?

16:29.071 --> 16:32.908
{\an1}YOU TWIST THESE LENSES AROUND
AND MAKE A FOOD PROCESSOR.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.619
IT MAKES JULIENNE FRIES.

16:35.703 --> 16:39.164
{\an1}BUT, MOSTLY I USE IT
AS ANOTHER EYESIGHT TEST.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.625
{\an5}I'M GOING
TO CHANGE
THE LENSES.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.292
{\an5}TELL ME IF
IT'S BETTER
OR WORSE.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.460
AH...

16:43.544 --> 16:45.671
OOH, BETTER.

16:45.754 --> 16:46.880
THERE, THAT'S GREAT.

16:46.964 --> 16:47.965
YOU SURE?

16:48.048 --> 16:50.843
I THINK IT MAKES ME
LOOK A LITTLE FAT.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.928
WELL, THAT'S IT
FOR THE TESTS.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.430
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, DOC?

16:54.513 --> 16:55.597
CAN YOU HELP ME?

16:55.681 --> 16:56.807
WELL, AFTER
A THOROUGH EXAM

16:56.890 --> 16:58.684
IT'S MY PROFESSIONAL
OPINION

16:58.767 --> 17:01.979
THAT YOU NEED...
AN EYE TRANSPLANT!

17:02.062 --> 17:03.939
AN EYE TRANSPLANT?!

YOU JUST NEED GLASSES.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.194
GLASSES?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.781
NO BIG DEAL,
QUITE NORMAL.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.452
{\an1}GET THIS PRESCRIPTION FILLED,
YOU'LL BE GOOD AS NEW.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.828
YOU CAN JACKHAMMER
ALL YOU WANT.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.664
GOOD LUCK

17:20.748 --> 17:21.874
OH, THANK YOU.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.709
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

17:23.791 --> 17:25.127
YOU WERE RIGHT, HEFF.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.545
{\an1}I NEED
GLASSES.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.090

<i>WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?</i>

17:30.174 --> 17:30.966

17:31.049 --> 17:33.761
OF COURSE HE WANTS
GLASSES, YOU DOOFUS

17:33.844 --> 17:36.638
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT STYLE.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.473
HMM, YES.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.640
WELL, SOMETHING SIMPLE
WOULD BE...

17:38.724 --> 17:41.643
NO, YOU LEAVE IT
TO US.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.562
WHEN IT COMES
TO STYLE

17:43.645 --> 17:44.772
WE KNOW
WHAT'S BEST.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.983
WE KNOW <i> HAUTE</i>
FROM <i> DECLASSE</i>

17:48.067 --> 17:49.443

17:49.526 --> 17:50.652
DON'T YOU
KNOW IT!

17:50.736 --> 17:53.655
FIRST, WE MUST DETERMINE
THE SHAPE OF YOUR FACE.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.950
HE LOOKS LIKE
ROUND TO ME.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.619
HE'S OBLONG.

17:58.702 --> 18:02.706
{\an5}OBLONG, SHMOBLONG,
HE'S A RECTANGLE,
IF HE'S ANYTHING.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.249
RECTANGLE, MY EYE.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.086
YOU'RE STRETCHING
HIM OUT OF SHAPE!

18:07.169 --> 18:08.003
YOU BOOBIE.

(<i> Rocko's face snaps back</i> )

18:11.089 --> 18:13.717
{\an1}LET'S JUST TRY
SOME OF THESE ON.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.093
OKEY-DOKEY.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.471

VERY DURABLE.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.356
<i>HASTA LA VISTA,</i>

18:27.439 --> 18:29.316
HOW DROOGIE.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.235
ROCK AND ROLL!

18:31.318 --> 18:32.486
{\an1}TOO COOL.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.237
SAY THE SECRET WORD!

18:35.405 --> 18:37.658
LOOK, THESE ARE ALL VERY NICE

18:37.741 --> 18:39.576
BUT HOW MUCH
WILL MY INSURANCE COVER?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.787
INSURANCE!

18:41.870 --> 18:45.874
I'M AFRAID THAT'S GOING
TO LIMIT YOUR SELECTION.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.167
QUITE A BIT.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.378
WHICH STYLES CAN I CHOOSE FROM?

18:49.461 --> 18:51.463
WELL, LET'S SEE.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.340
ANY ONE OF THESE.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.889
{\an1}OH, HEFF, I FEEL HOKEY
WITH THESE ON.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.226
COME ON, ROCK,
SPECS ARE COOL.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.061
SEE? LOOK AT FILBURT.

19:06.144 --> 19:10.065
{\an1}I SAID NO, I DON'T WANT
MY GLASSES WASHED.

19:10.148 --> 19:14.987
{\an1}OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
HERE YOU GO.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.572
HI, FELLAS.
NEW GLASSES?

19:16.655 --> 19:20.200
ROCKO'S FEELING DOWN
ABOUT HIS NEW EYEWEAR.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.118
GIVE HIM A PEP TALK.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.204
{\an1}DON'T WORRY, ROCKO,
GLASSES AREN'T SO BAD.

19:24.288 --> 19:28.458
{\an1}ASIDE FROM THE FACT
THAT PEOPLE CALL YOU NAMES

19:28.542 --> 19:29.167
LIKE "FOUR EYES."

19:29.251 --> 19:31.753
GIRLS WON'T GO OUT WITH YOU

19:31.837 --> 19:34.214
{\an1}YOU'RE OSTRACIZED
BY EVERY SOCIAL GROUP

19:34.298 --> 19:36.592
{\an1}YOU CAN'T SWIM
WITH THEM...

19:36.675 --> 19:38.385
{\an1}IF YOU LOSE THEM,
YOU CAN'T FIND THEM...

19:38.468 --> 19:40.846
{\an1}OH, FISH STICKS,
I'VE DEPRESSED MYSELF.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.349
I HAVE TO GO LIE DOWN.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.311
THANKS, FILBURT,
I FEEL <i> LOTS</i> BETTER NOW.

19:47.394 --> 19:52.941
{\an1}OH, WELL, AT LEAST NOW I CAN SEE
AND GET SOME MORE TRAINING IN.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.568
THE FINALS ARE TONIGHT.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.784
IT'S NO USE,
MY GLASSES KEEP FALLING OFF.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.455
HERE, ROCKO, TRY THIS.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.916
{\an1}THIS RUBBER BAND WILL HELP
HOLD IT ON YOUR HEAD.

20:08.999 --> 20:12.461
{\an5}OKAY,
LET'S GIVE
IT A TRY.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.297
{\an1}I THINK IT'S CUTTING OFF
THE CIRCULATION TO MY BRAIN.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.634
{\an1}WILL YOU BE USING YOUR BRAIN
DURING THE COMPETITION?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.552
(<i> grunting</i> )

20:20.636 --> 20:23.722
(<i> panting</i> )

20:26.058 --> 20:28.268
(<i> glass breaking</i> )

20:33.065 --> 20:34.483
LOOK, THEY'RE BROKEN.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.402
I'LL NEVER GET A NEW PAIR
BEFORE TONIGHT.

20:37.486 --> 20:42.407
AND I CAN'T SEE WELL ENOUGH TO
JACKHAMMER WITHOUT MY GLASSES.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.242
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.328
BUT HEFF,
THERE'S NO TIME.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.246
THE COMPETITION IS ONLY
A FEW HOURS AWAY.

20:48.330 --> 20:52.626
I'VE GOT TO THINK, HEFF,
I'M GOING TO TAKE A WALK.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.170
POOR LITTLE GUY

20:55.253 --> 20:59.007
THIS COMPETITION MEANS
A LOT TO HIM.

20:59.967 --> 21:05.681
(<i> call to post plays</i> )

21:05.764 --> 21:08.684
WHERE IS HE?
IT'S ALMOST HIS TURN.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.310
{\an5}Arena announcer:
Next up in the figure
jacking competition--

21:10.394 --> 21:14.022
he's a local boy, so let's
really hear it for Rocko!

21:14.106 --> 21:18.443
OH, NO, HE'S NOT
WEARING HIS GLASSES!

21:18.527 --> 21:21.405
{\an1}LOOK OUT, EVERYONE!
HE'S VISUALLY IMPAIRED!

21:23.407 --> 21:24.491
Oh, he's off to a nice start.

21:24.574 --> 21:28.787
This is a very ambitious routine
for the young wallaby.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.915
And here's his first jump,
a triple klutz

21:31.999 --> 21:33.667
and he nailed the landing.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.545
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

21:36.628 --> 21:42.634
And now he's going for the very
difficult triple thumper doodler

21:42.718 --> 21:44.386
and... he's got it!

21:44.469 --> 21:46.722
He's got to be happy with that.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.432
Listen to the crowd
show their approval.

21:48.515 --> 21:52.769
{\an1}He's finishing with an inverted
pebble maker-- nicely done.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.896
And here's his dismount.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.400
(<i> crowd roaring</i> )

21:58.483 --> 22:02.738
Wow! What a remarkable routine
by the plucky little wallaby.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.156
HEY, HE DIDN'T MAIM ANYONE.

22:04.239 --> 22:08.201
{\an8}We now wait
for the judges' scores...

22:08.285 --> 22:09.077
{\an8}Wow, look at those scores.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.873
{\an8}9.0, 8.5, 9.5 and a 6.0

22:12.956 --> 22:15.584
{\an8}but that, of course,
from the Transylvanian judge.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.920
{\an7}But it's enough to give
the championship to Rocko!

22:19.004 --> 22:22.090
WOW, ROCKO,
THAT WAS GREAT!

22:22.174 --> 22:24.092
{\an1}HOW'D YOU DO IT
WITHOUT YOUR GLASSES?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.177
I DIDN'T.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.137
HUH? I DON'T GET IT.

22:27.220 --> 22:31.016
{\an1}I WENT BACK TO THE OPTOMETRIST
AND GOT CONTACT LENSES.

22:31.099 --> 22:31.975
SEE?

22:32.059 --> 22:34.603
WOW! LET ME SEE!

22:34.686 --> 22:35.395
{\an3}COOL.

22:35.479 --> 22:39.900
{\an1}CONTACTS, HUH?
THAT'S WHAT I WEAR.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.819
BIFF BENDERHAUS,
YOU WEAR CONTACTS, TOO?

22:42.903 --> 22:45.947
THAT'S RIGHT, BUT ONLY
WHEN I'M JACKHAMMERING.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.616
OTHERWISE, I WEAR THESE.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.492
WHY?

22:48.575 --> 22:52.245
{\an1}BECAUSE THEY MAKE ME
LOOK INTELLECTUAL.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.705
{\an1}HEY, ARE YOU
AN INTELLECTUAL?

22:53.789 --> 22:55.248
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

22:55.332 --> 23:01.463
WHY, YES, YES, I AM;
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

23:01.546 --> 23:05.175
{\an1}WELL, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT NIETZSCHE?

23:05.258 --> 23:08.178
I GUESS HAVING GLASSES
ISN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.638
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET SOME GLASSES.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.765
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH <i> YOUR</i> EYESIGHT?

23:11.848 --> 23:14.768
{\an1}NO, I HAVE PROBLEMS NOT KNOWING
WHO NIETZSCHE IS.

23:21.399 --> 23:25.195
