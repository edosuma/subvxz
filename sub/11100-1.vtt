Here you go.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.948
Y'all go fuck
your selves now, okay?

06:04.239 --> 06:05.490
Give me a smoke.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.118
I don't got any.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.580
What? You quit?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.792
Shit. That ain't gonna last.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.729
Daddy!

06:36.313 --> 06:39.149
Hey, bug. How you doing?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.234
Did you see our sign?
Grandma and me made it this morning.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.320
Yeah. It's really nice.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.698
Welcome home, son.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.411
- Excited? Want some juice?
- Yup.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.955
All right, then you
help me set the table.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.207
I made you all a meat loaf.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.251
Hope you'll stay for supper.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.919
Oh, I don't know.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.714
What time you gotta work?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.549
Want me to warm
up the corn for you?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.551
Yeah. That'd be great.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.845
I ain't on tonight.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.267
What?
Friday night, you ain't on?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.353
What the hell is that?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.271
Baby, why don't you go
bring out the chair, huh?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.649
That cocksucker Mark better
be givin' you your time

07:20.732 --> 07:23.234
or I'm gonna go over there
and bust in his teeth.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.237
Why ain't there no beer?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.866
I ain't dancing
no more, Sam.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.535
Quit a couple of weeks ago.
Got a job over at Freemont.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.331
Are you telling me the
truth or is this a joke?

07:36.414 --> 07:39.334
Pick up a second shift every now
and then, weekends if I want 'em.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.794
It's good money.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.089
Good money?
What, are you stupid, woman?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.592
You quit stripping?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.928
To pack fucking
mushrooms at Freemont?

07:50.011 --> 07:52.305
- Sam.
- Ma, keep your mouth shut!

07:52.389 --> 07:54.933
They're good to me over there, Sam.
They got daycare for Paige...

07:55.016 --> 07:56.601
- No.
- ...medical at the end of the year.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.603
I'll tell you what
you're gonna do.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.313
You're going back
to the Bunny Hop,

08:00.397 --> 08:03.358
and you're gonna get that cocksucker
to give you your old slot back.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.111
You wanna go outside
and ride your bike?

08:06.194 --> 08:07.779
- No, Sam.
- The fuck you ain't.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.031
You're gonna get your ass back
up there and make your tips.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.659
- It ain't right.
- Fuck are you talking about?

08:13.159 --> 08:16.413
I ain't dancing no more because it
ain't right in the eyes of God.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.666
- He don't want me doing that no more.
- Oh, you've found God now?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.042
- That's what this is?
- He found me.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.254
- Don't give me that bullshit!
- He's there for you too, baby.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.632
You're a fucking junkie
stripper and you know it.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.011
Not no more. God helped me
change while you was away.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.890
Get your hands off of me.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.980
You can't keep going the
way you've been going!

09:19.684 --> 09:22.312
Hey, Big Dave, how's
it going, buddy?

09:29.486 --> 09:32.280
What the fuck?
Crazy horse, there he fucking is!

09:32.322 --> 09:34.157
- Donnie.
- It's about time, man.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.744
- Holy shit.
- Figured you must be rollin' out sometime soon.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.872
- Man. How you doing, boy?
- Look at you.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.416
- I'm doing.
- Yeah? I get you.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.377
You look no worse for the wear.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.004
- I'm all right.
- Yeah?

09:48.963 --> 09:51.090
You make any new
friends in there?

09:51.174 --> 09:52.926
Funny fucker.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.889
Hey, your old lady ain't at the Bunny
Hop any more. What's going on?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.849
- Bitch found Jesus.
- No way.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.976
Better him than the
milkman, right?

10:03.478 --> 10:06.147
- Not so sure about that.
- Ah, yeah, right?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.067
Glad to have you back.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.402
- That's sweet.
- That's Jackie. Let's go.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.154
Hey, here's to you.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.697
Quit fucking around.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.827
What, you want a taste?

10:20.411 --> 10:21.788
Fuck, yeah.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.498
All right. Get moving.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.375
Come on, let's go.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.126
Careful.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.007
- Crazy horse.
- Crazy horse!

10:33.091 --> 10:35.093
Crazy horse.

Open up, man! You there?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.202
Come on, man, open up.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.252
Fuck are you, man?

13:14.335 --> 13:16.587
It's just me, man. Come on, let me in.
It's fucking cold.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.631
- I don't know you.
- Yeah, you do.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.842
We were hanging out the other day.
I'm Bobby's friend.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.719
Fuck is Bobby?
Man, get your crack ass...

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
Okay, have it your way.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.392
Shit!

13:35.106 --> 13:36.441
Fuck that.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.484
Where you going?

13:42.613 --> 13:46.534
What the fuck are you running
from, pussy? Huh? Huh?

13:46.617 --> 13:49.370
Piece of fucking shit!
You wanna fuck with me?

13:49.454 --> 13:52.248
- I'll smash your fucking skull in!
- I'll give you whatever you want!

13:52.331 --> 13:54.959
- I'll smash your fucking skull in.
- I'll give you whatever you want, man.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.502
Tell me where the
fucking shit is

13:56.586 --> 13:59.422
or I'll blow your nigger brains
all over the fucking floor!

13:59.756 --> 14:01.049
It's in there! It's in there!

14:01.132 --> 14:03.551
Get it! Get a fucking move on!

14:03.634 --> 14:05.261
Piece of shit!

14:05.344 --> 14:07.889
- Get a fucking move on!
- All right. Okay.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.475
- Hurry the fuck up!
- Be cool.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.978
Fuck, here's...

14:14.062 --> 14:15.563
Be cool, man. Be cool.

Oh, shit. Oh, that's nice.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.318
Give me the cash.
Give me the fucking cash!

14:22.236 --> 14:24.072
You piece of shit.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.156
All right!

14:25.239 --> 14:26.741
Fucking nigger bitch.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.034
All right!

14:28.117 --> 14:30.620
- Be cool, man!
- Piece of shit.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.289
Whoo!

14:33.372 --> 14:35.541
Yeah! That was some crazy shit.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.712
- That was pretty fun, I have to admit.
- Where'd the fucking ashtray go?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.882
Shit, Donnie. Your car is a mess.
You gotta clean this shit up.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.675
Yes, stick me, baby.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.511
I'm ready to take off.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.096
Get a wake up?

14:48.179 --> 14:50.807
I want to hit this.
I'm going 100 miles an hour.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.268
- This is some good shit.
- Fucking levitate!

14:54.352 --> 14:55.812
Okay. Be still now, baby.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.023
I'm still.
I'm still as a cucumber.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.526
Yup. Find it?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.487
We good? Yeah?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.614
- Get the wheel, get the wheel.
- Got the wheel.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.740
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.956
You got it! You got it.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.749
I feel the need.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.253
The need for fucking speed.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.258
Whoa, whoa.
Look at this sorry fucker over here.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.759
I see him.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.470
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.102
This is my good
deed for the day, right'?

15:36.185 --> 15:37.937
- Come on, bro!
- Come on.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.023
Fucking cold as hell.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.900
Shit.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.486
Ah, fuck.
Cold enough for you out there, boy?

15:45.695 --> 15:46.904
Yeah.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.406
Where you going, man?

15:48.489 --> 15:49.574
Dushore.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.367
That's up there
past Muncy, right?

15:51.450 --> 15:52.618
Yeah.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.454
We can take you as
far as McClure.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.373
Take me to Dushore.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.961
We ain't going to Dushore.
We said we can take you as far as...

16:03.629 --> 16:04.839
What the fuck!

16:04.922 --> 16:06.299
Keep driving.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.884
Take that fucking blade off him!

16:07.967 --> 16:10.094
Dushore or I cut his
fucking throat.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.555
Take that fucking blade off him!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.017
No! Shit!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.953
What are you doing?

16:36.037 --> 16:37.496
Pull over!

17:31.175 --> 17:32.468
Help me.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.893
Good. Wanna try it again?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.521
Okay.
Let's try it one more time.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.983
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...
- To the flag...

17:47.066 --> 17:49.527
- of the United States of America.
- Of the United States of America,

17:49.610 --> 17:52.238
and to the republic
for which it stands.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.199
<i>One nation...</i>

17:55.283 --> 17:56.701
<i>One nation...</i>

17:57.285 --> 17:58.411
...under God...

17:58.494 --> 17:59.870
...under God,

18:00.121 --> 18:04.166
<i>indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.</i>

18:10.589 --> 18:12.508
He coming or ain't he?

18:13.342 --> 18:14.885
I don't know.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.937
Honey, you ready?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.359
I don't got no good shoes, Lynn.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.613
Oh, baby, He don't care what
kind of shoes you wearing.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.827
<i>He breathes his
spirit into the darkness,</i>

18:39.910 --> 18:41.829
<i>and He makes something</i> good.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.166
He sees our shadow and He
says, "Let there be light."

18:46.208 --> 18:49.003
The point of receiving
God's word is life.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.923
Life upon life and to
accept the blood of Jesus

18:52.965 --> 18:55.885
that is life upon
life upon life.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.971
Praise be to God. Praise be to God.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.978
In Mark it talks about John the Baptist,
how he went about baptizing the water.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.651
I'm unworthy even to unlace
the thong of his sandal.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.071
I baptize the water.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.573
But he will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.203
Let us now proclaim
His saving Grace.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.081
If there are sinners here
today, looking for God,

19:25.623 --> 19:29.668
I want you to raise your hands.
Come on, raise them up high to heaven.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.881
Raise your hands and stand up.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.257
Come on, now. Stand up.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.635
Receive Jesus Christ as your
light and your Saviour.

19:43.974 --> 19:48.104
Brother, I see it.
I see that look of doubt in your eye.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.481
I know you're thinking, "I'm
just too dirty a sinner.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.525
"He can't forgive
me." Yes, He can.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.945
Yes, He can. You just knock and be received.
Come on now, stand up.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.489
Come on home to Jesus. Yes.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.117
Stand up. All right. All right.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.869
Hallelujah.
We're gonna wash away our sins

20:03.953 --> 20:06.330
in the blood of the lamb.
We're gonna baptize right now.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.875
Come on down. Come on down right now.
Come on down.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.212
Everybody. Come on down.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.881
Come on down, brother and son.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.136
Praise be to God.
We're gonna save some folks tonight.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.097
Yes, come on down now.
Come on, Brother.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.933
We're gonna save you now.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.936
Come on in. Yes, I want you
to cross your arms now.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.313
Cross your arms. Yes.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.233
Stand right here. Okay.

20:35.025 --> 20:38.821
Upon your confession of faith and
your obedience to the word of God,

20:38.904 --> 20:40.948
regarding His death,
burial and resurrection.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.618
I do indeed baptize you in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ

20:44.702 --> 20:47.079
for the remission of your sins.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.545
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

20:56.922 --> 20:59.592
Welcome home, Brother.
Welcome home. You're saved.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.095
Hallelujah! Praise God.

Hey, you need me
to stay on, I can.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.959
We're gonna be moving
inside next week.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.962
I'll give you a call if something breaks.
You do good work.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.173
Thanks.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.051
And out of the houses
the rats came tumbling.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.387
Brother rats, sister rats.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.431
And husband rats followed
their little rat wives.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.309
<i>Till they came to
the ragin' water,</i>

22:32.393 --> 22:35.271
<i>where they drowned and
lost their lives.</i>

22:37.481 --> 22:41.277
I don't deal bikes. You might have a
better shot if you take it over to Pitt,

22:41.318 --> 22:42.987
or maybe down to Philly.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.905
I gotta sell it today.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.829
I got something in Pitt.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.914
But you gotta have
some college for that.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.078
Well, well, well.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.457
I was wondering when I'd
see you again, man.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.043
How you doing, my brother?

23:41.587 --> 23:42.963
I'm doing.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.299
Yeah.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.842
I've missed you.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.975
I heard you found Jesus.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.145
Yeah, a little bit.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.108
Hallelujah.

24:05.027 --> 24:08.655
Hey, Jackie.
Give me a mash and a bud.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.367
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Jackie.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.785
You want something?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.370
No. I'm good.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.455
Uh-huh.

24:17.498 --> 24:21.710
Hey, you know...
that old Indian didn't die that night.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.170
What?

24:23.253 --> 24:25.130
Yeah, saw it on the TV.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.801
Somebody picked the poor bastard up.
Took him to the emergency room.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.264
Can you believe that shit?

24:34.640 --> 24:37.518
God was looking out for both
of us, I suppose, then.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.816
Here's to Him.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.610
Yeah.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.949
I didn't hear you pull up.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.700
No.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.537
I got Lynn's car.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.373
She broke down on you?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.168
I sold her.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.713
No fucking way, man.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.592
Should have come and seen
your old buddy first.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.261
I know. I know.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.973
You want a taste?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.996
I'm sorry I'm late.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.720
Gave blood over in Pitt.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.145
It's all I got.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.616
<i>We're tracking what now
looks like a tornado outbreak.</i>

26:17.242 --> 26:18.785
<i>We've now confirmed
two tornadoes</i>

26:18.869 --> 26:20.996
<i>that have touched down
in the Harrisburg area.</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:23.123
Two touched down
near Harrisburg.

26:23.207 --> 26:26.585
<i>Moving northeast towards Allentown,
Reading and Lancaster.</i>

26:35.552 --> 26:36.637
Paige.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.890
Come on, Paige, you gotta get up.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.644
Wake up.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.604
Come on, come on, come on.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.237
Baby?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.239
Baby, what are you doing?

26:57.324 --> 26:58.575
I know.

27:00.869 --> 27:01.995
Hey.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.497
Stand back.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.137
Get in.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.447
Bug.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.992
You hear me? You hear me, bug?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.827
We're going to play
the game, bug.

27:41.910 --> 27:42.953
Whale!

27:43.036 --> 27:45.455
I'm thinking of a snail, bug.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.458
I'm thinking of a whale.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.045
Good job, bug. Good job.

27:53.046 --> 27:57.384
You said whale.
I'm thinking of a pail.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.722
You said pail.
I'm thinking of a tail.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.855
Good job, bug. Good job.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.048
Sam!

28:38.550 --> 28:39.926
Hey, Billy.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.763
Tried ringing you, but
your phone's down.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.683
That damn twister touched down eight
places between here and Noblesville.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.102
Chewed up 600 homes in
Fulton County alone.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.980
Got all the work you can
handle, if you're interested.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.649
I'm interested.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.193
But I'm putting my
own crew together.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.820
We go 50-50 on the jobs.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.323
You cover me and any
heavy machines I need.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.034
60-40 till you pay me
back on the tools.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.078
Then we go half and
you got a deal.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.757
I can still see.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.802
- Keep them closed.
- What are you doing, Sam Childers?

29:21.885 --> 29:23.303
- Ready?
- Yes.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.513
Yes.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.973
Open them up.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.060
Where are we?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.729
We're home, Paige.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.064
That's ours?

29:34.147 --> 29:36.149
Go on, check it out.

29:38.318 --> 29:41.697
Your room's upstairs.
It's the small one.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.285
That's everything.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.204
You get what's
in the trunk?

29:49.287 --> 29:50.414
Yup.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.668
Lord, you are filthy,
Sam Childers.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.880
Who you calling filthy, woman?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.090
You.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.968
Now you're filthier than I am.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.685
Come on, give me a little shake.

30:11.768 --> 30:14.062
Mmm-mmm.
I don't do that no more.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.605
<i>- Uh-huh?
- Mmm-mmm.</i>

30:16.022 --> 30:17.482
Not even for your old man?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.528
Maybe just a little bit.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.029
There you go.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.616
You're naughty.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.577
Come here.

30:48.263 --> 30:52.601
<i>♪ There is power, power
wonder-working power</i>

30:52.684 --> 30:57.022
♪ <i>In the precious
blood of the Lamb</i> ♪

30:59.941 --> 31:01.359
Hallelujah.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.405
Today we have a special guest.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.991
It is my pleasure to present
to you Pastor Relling

31:08.074 --> 31:11.661
from the Kilangire Christian
Mission in Uganda, Africa.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.413
Pastor Relling.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.879
Thank you, Pastor
Krause, and thank you,

31:20.962 --> 31:24.466
brothers and sisters, for inviting
me into this house of the Lord.

31:24.716 --> 31:28.845
I'm here today to talk to you about
your Christian brothers and sisters,

31:28.929 --> 31:33.809
families just like yours, half a world
away, that desperately need your help.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.853
Though they might
appear to be strangers,

31:37.395 --> 31:40.398
living a life very
different from our own,

31:40.482 --> 31:43.652
in God's eyes, every
man is a brother,

31:44.277 --> 31:49.199
and every soul is deserving
of your Christian charity.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.414
Don't move.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.127
Be cool.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.554
What the fuck, man.
What are you doing here?

32:13.139 --> 32:15.684
I'm here for that
boy right there.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.437
You gonna get in
the way of that?

32:33.952 --> 32:37.873
Oh, Sammy, I can't do it.
I can't. I can't.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.375
God don't make trash, boy.

32:40.917 --> 32:44.796
He ain't giving up on you so don't
you give up on Him, you hear me?

32:50.051 --> 32:51.511
What was wrong with her anyway?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.638
I don't know.
They called it thrombosis.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.640
And she couldn't walk, she
couldn't drive any more.

32:56.099 --> 32:59.185
But you know, I think that prayer circle
made all the difference in the world.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.521
- And now she can get her hair done.
- That's right.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.857
Babe, why don't you go grab
some more beans, will you?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.736
You know, I was thinking
about that fella, Sunday.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.154
What fella?

33:09.237 --> 33:12.407
That Pastor Relling.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.827
- The missionary fella.
A nice-looking man.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.621
Oh, yeah, he talked funny.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.123
He's just from a difference place
than us, baby, that's all.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.125
I like what they're
doing down there.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.586
- It's a good cause.
- Sure is.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.798
I was thinking maybe I could
go over there. You know?

33:29.132 --> 33:31.301
See what they got going on.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.553
- Africa?
- Yeah.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.681
- You mean like to help them?
- Yeah, why not?

33:36.765 --> 33:38.975
Reckon they can do with all
the help they can get.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.518
Especially in construction.

33:40.602 --> 33:41.978
Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.897
- Well, that's a good idea.
- Thought I'd go and do that.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.899
What about the business?

33:45.982 --> 33:48.610
What about that job you've
got going over in Boswell?

33:48.693 --> 33:50.904
Job's gonna be
finished in five days.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.490
I'll only be gone for
a few weeks though.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.575
I'll be back before you know it.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.954
It's not so
long, we'll be fine.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.121
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

34:00.205 --> 34:01.623
It's not so long.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.458
- Yeah? Yeah?
- It's a nice idea, Sam.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.286
What are you?

34:40.911 --> 34:42.746
Ugandan Army or something?

34:43.331 --> 34:46.501
SPLA. Sudanese People's
Liberation Army.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.920
Yeah, I don't know that.
What's that?

34:50.130 --> 34:51.505
We are freedom fighters.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.887
Well, hello, freedom fighters.
I'm Sam.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.431
My name is Deng.

34:59.514 --> 35:03.935
Deng? Nice to meet you, Deng.
Sam.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.314
- Marco.
- Hey, Marco.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.067
So, you boys busy or...

35:12.444 --> 35:14.612
Maybe you can give me a
hand with the rubble.

35:16.990 --> 35:20.910
No. I didn't think so.
All right. Good.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.914
Well, I'll let you guys get
back to what you were doing.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.834
But I'll be seeing you around.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.844
Childers.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.221
Some of us are going into
Kampala tomorrow night.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.058
Try to find a little fun this weekend.
You wanna come along?

35:44.017 --> 35:46.978
Actually, I was thinking
of going up north.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.732
You crazy? There's a civil
war going on up there.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.525
I know.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.446
Suit yourself.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.791
Hey, Deng, want a Coke?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.292
Yes.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.922
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.173
Ooh.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.884
You got a cool breeze blowing
through the shade here.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.470
It's very hot today.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.721
Yeah.

36:23.598 --> 36:24.891
I got a question for you.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.853
I wanna go into
Sudan this weekend.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.648
I need someone to
show me around.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.566
You interested?

36:34.943 --> 36:37.195
The others are going to Kampala.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.488
I know.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.950
That ain't my speed no more.
I wanna see some country.

36:46.579 --> 36:47.872
You want to see?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.841
This thing go any faster?

36:58.133 --> 36:59.467
I wish it could.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.554
Travelling is the most
dangerous time in Sudan.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.808
If the rebels find us on open
road, it will be very bad.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.397
So where you from?

37:12.981 --> 37:15.275
A little village called Aweil.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.694
Many hours from here. And you?

37:18.361 --> 37:19.696
Are you from New York City?

37:19.779 --> 37:20.905
No.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.907
I ain't no city boy.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.702
I'm a hillbilly
from Pennsylvania.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.413
Pennsylvania.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.332
That's it. Pennsylvania.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.835
Pennsylvania.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.046
Is Aweil where your family is?

37:38.882 --> 37:42.010
Not any more.
My family was killed by the IRA.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.160
The Muslim north
has been killing

38:07.243 --> 38:09.913
the Christians in the
south for over 30 years.

38:12.165 --> 38:14.751
Two million of my people
lost their lives.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.421
These people have been
driven from their villages.

38:18.504 --> 38:21.466
But as you can see, these
camps are not much better.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.847
Cholera and malaria
are everywhere.

38:29.098 --> 38:32.227
Even here, they are afraid the
IRA will attack at night.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.067
Sorry, I will be right back.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.318
Course.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.861
Do what you gotta do.

38:46.699 --> 38:47.951
Excuse me, you.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.620
Black shirt. Come over here.
Please help me.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.831
I need to transfer this woman to the bed.
Grab her by her shoulders.

38:54.707 --> 38:58.336
One, two, three.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.298
- What do we have here?
- Trauma to the lips.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.676
Can I have some gauze,
please, for direct pressure?

39:06.886 --> 39:08.930
- What happened?
- Trauma to her lips.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.682
What happened to her face?

39:10.974 --> 39:13.518
She argued with the rebels
so they cut off her lips.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.270
These are Kony's orders.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.771
Who's Kony?

39:17.480 --> 39:18.940
Who are you with?

39:21.567 --> 39:23.152
I'm with Deng over there.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.321
Which organization?

39:25.405 --> 39:27.907
I'm with the Christian
group down in the south.

39:28.408 --> 39:31.077
Just up here taking
a look around.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.374
This isn't a tourist
destination; This is a war zone.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.377
If you stay here, you're
going to get killed.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.505
Thank you for your help.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.719
Some people say Kony's a wizard.
A shape-shifter.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.514
He calls himself a Christian,
but I say he's Satan,

39:51.597 --> 39:53.766
who devours his own people.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.520
So, Kony is the...
He's the leader of the IRA?

39:57.854 --> 40:00.523
Yes, he's the one we've
been fighting for years.

40:00.606 --> 40:03.151
But there's very
little we can do.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.988
Our weapons are old, our
boots full of holes.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.365
We've been forgotten
by the whole world.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.245
What are you doing here?

40:15.580 --> 40:16.831
Excuse me?

40:17.165 --> 40:19.208
What are you looking
for in this place?

40:21.044 --> 40:23.212
I ain't looking for nothing.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.549
So, you get your picture taken?

40:27.592 --> 40:31.637
Go back to your life and all this will
be stories you will tell your friends.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.849
Yeah, maybe.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.898
Hey, can I take a
look at that gun?

40:46.861 --> 40:48.905
You say she's jamming on you?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.990
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

40:52.533 --> 40:56.371
Yeah. Yeah, that's cause
she's full of dirt.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.373
Dirt and grit.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.876
You gotta strip her down once a day.
Keep her well-oiled.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.962
No wonder she's jamming on you.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.923
Are you military?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.257
Hell, no.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.676
I just like my guns.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.083
The night commuters.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.961
They come from deep in the bush.

41:45.670 --> 41:48.297
Their parents send them out
because it's safer to sleep here

41:48.381 --> 41:50.425
than in their own homes.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.136
Why?

41:54.679 --> 41:57.265
Because death comes at
night in the villages.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.351
These are the lucky ones so far.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.687
The ones the rebels
haven't found yet.

42:09.819 --> 42:10.987
<i>Sam.</i>

42:17.326 --> 42:19.495
Come on! Get up, let's go.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.665
Come on, get up.
Let's go. Get up.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.626
Hey, get up. Let's go.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.629
Get a move on. Get up.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.673
- Hey, come on. Get up.
- What are you doing?

42:30.756 --> 42:33.009
Let's go. Get up.
They ain't sleeping out here.

42:33.593 --> 42:36.471
Tell them they're coming inside.
Come on, you all get up.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.681
- Sam.
- Let's go.

42:38.848 --> 42:41.017
Sam. There are too many.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.060
You can't help them all.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.357
Well, I can take
these ones here.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.277
Yeah. Come on inside.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.404
Come on. Hurry up.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.576
Keep 'em coming.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.162
Go on. Take a bed.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.414
<i>Sam.</i>

43:48.125 --> 43:49.168
<i>Sam.</i>

43:50.920 --> 43:52.546
The IRA attacked a
village last night.

43:53.506 --> 43:55.216
You said you wanted to see.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.673
You see any tigers over there?

46:41.841 --> 46:44.009
No, I didn't see no tigers.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.054
Do they even have
tigers over there?

46:47.972 --> 46:49.682
I don't think so.

46:51.851 --> 46:53.352
You go on a safari?

46:54.603 --> 46:58.691
No. I didn't go on no safari.
Come on. Let's go to bed.

47:01.235 --> 47:03.571
- There we go.
- I'm thinking of a plane.

47:03.654 --> 47:07.658
- No, no, come on. You gotta get to sleep.
- Come on, Dad, plane. I'm thinking of a plane.

47:11.328 --> 47:14.206
You said plane, I'm
thinking of a train.

47:14.790 --> 47:17.668
You said train, I'm
thinking of a brain.

47:18.836 --> 47:21.380
You said brain, I'm
thinking of a...

47:22.047 --> 47:23.799
- Gotcha. Okay.
- Okay, you got me.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.178
You could have said drain or
mane, like a horse's mane.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.888
Sweet dreams, bug.

47:28.971 --> 47:30.181
Good night, Dad.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.682
Good night.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.727
I'm glad you're home.

47:40.149 --> 47:41.692
Coming to bed?

47:44.570 --> 47:46.155
Yeah, in a bit.

48:46.382 --> 48:47.550
Baby...

48:50.427 --> 48:51.595
Baby...

48:54.181 --> 48:55.683
What you doing?

48:57.685 --> 48:59.186
Making plans.

49:00.688 --> 49:02.147
You been to bed yet?

49:02.231 --> 49:03.315
No.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.611
I had a vision last night, Lynn.

49:08.404 --> 49:11.949
I know it sounds crazy,
but God spoke to me.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.827
Here. Take a look at this.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.705
You want to take a look?

49:19.206 --> 49:21.458
I'm going to build a church.

49:21.542 --> 49:22.585
A church?

49:22.668 --> 49:25.004
Yeah. Right across the street.

49:25.462 --> 49:29.216
But not a church like Faith United
or Calvary Fellowship, you know.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.884
A place that ain't
gonna turn you away

49:30.968 --> 49:33.596
if you're a prostitute or
drug addict or something.

49:33.679 --> 49:37.933
A place for sinners just like me, but
who want to hear the word of God.

49:38.851 --> 49:41.228
How you gonna pay for a church?

49:41.520 --> 49:44.690
Well, we got money in the
bank, business is good.

49:44.773 --> 49:47.192
Besides, I own a
construction company,

49:47.276 --> 49:49.570
so I'm gonna give us one heck
of a good deal on the build.

49:50.404 --> 49:51.488
You're crazy.

49:51.572 --> 49:52.656
A little bit.

49:55.117 --> 49:57.494
Now here, take a look at this.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.376
What is that?

50:06.003 --> 50:08.881
That's the orphanage
that I'm going to build.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.050
In Sudan.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.597
Frank, make sure
that siding's long.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.182
All right, Sam.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.402
♪ <i>I witness</i>

50:30.486 --> 50:35.282
<i>♪ I see the cross

It's five till and
he still ain't here.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.090
Call him?

50:51.173 --> 50:52.966
Yeah, I called him.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.386
Well, then, call him again.

51:43.892 --> 51:47.730
Thank you, Tory. Now you folks are
sounding pretty good up here.

51:48.355 --> 51:49.732
Gotta say.

51:52.317 --> 51:53.444
Sam.

51:55.738 --> 51:57.531
Sorry. There we go.

51:57.614 --> 51:59.950
How's that? Good?

52:00.033 --> 52:01.869
Good. Yeah.

52:01.952 --> 52:05.164
Well, I'd like to thank you
all for coming out today,

52:05.247 --> 52:08.459
for the first day of worship here
at Shekinah Fellowship Church.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.676
Thank you.

52:18.177 --> 52:21.472
Never really been too keen on
talking in front of people.

52:22.055 --> 52:25.309
But the guest speaker we had
today, well, he didn't show up,

52:25.392 --> 52:27.644
so I thought I would get
up and say a few words.

52:29.104 --> 52:31.565
Okay, well, lot of youse
knows me pretty good.

52:31.648 --> 52:35.152
Knows I ain't exactly the
best seed in the bunch.

52:35.235 --> 52:39.490
Maybe you was wondering what made
me want to build this here church.

52:40.449 --> 52:43.952
I gotta tell you that standing up here
right now, I ain't so sure myself.

52:47.581 --> 52:49.666
But God don't only
call the good.

52:50.375 --> 52:52.753
I reckon every now and again
he calls us sinners too,

52:52.836 --> 52:54.880
and I was about as
bad as they come.

52:57.549 --> 53:00.010
Bunch of years ago I
was in the woods.

53:00.093 --> 53:04.431
I was running from some pretty bad fellas
in the woods over there by Cleary.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.978
And those old boys, they was
coming after me pretty hard.

53:10.062 --> 53:13.106
Well, I reached in my bag.
I was looking for my old shotgun.

53:14.233 --> 53:15.818
Well, it was gone.

53:16.443 --> 53:20.614
And my <i>momma</i> had took it
out when I wasn't looking...

53:21.240 --> 53:24.868
and shoved this here Bible in there instead.
Yes, she did.

53:24.952 --> 53:25.994
All right, Momma.

53:29.957 --> 53:33.335
Well, I figured I was
pretty much done for,

53:33.418 --> 53:37.422
so I sat down under an oak tree
with this useless book in my hand

53:37.506 --> 53:38.549
and I just waited.

53:40.676 --> 53:42.594
And then the strangest
thing happened.

53:43.762 --> 53:46.932
Those boys, they just,
they ran right on past me.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.060
They didn't even see
me sitting there.

53:51.770 --> 53:55.774
Nowthe way I figure it, things would
have turned out pretty different

53:55.858 --> 53:59.611
if I'd pulled out that shotgun
instead of this here Bible.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.782
But you know, it
got me thinking.

54:05.450 --> 54:09.538
God is looking out for each
and every one of you, too.

54:11.415 --> 54:14.042
And all you gotta do
is just open the door,

54:14.376 --> 54:15.836
and let Him right on in.

54:16.378 --> 54:18.005
Amen! Amen!

54:27.347 --> 54:30.392
It's okay, sweetie.
I'll be back before you know it.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.811
You're gonna miss my play.

54:32.895 --> 54:35.439
Well, Momma can
videotape it for me.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.482
I gotta get.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.694
You watch out for them while
I'm gone, buddy, okay?

54:40.777 --> 54:42.487
That's done, man.

55:01.465 --> 55:04.468
You came all the way here
to bring us some new boots?

55:10.849 --> 55:12.643
Okay, okay, Okay...

55:16.480 --> 55:19.191
Right here. Stop the car.
Stop the car.

55:28.700 --> 55:29.826
<i>Sam.</i>

55:35.457 --> 55:36.833
Sam, wait.

55:37.542 --> 55:39.086
It's not safe here.

55:45.425 --> 55:46.843
This is it.

55:48.553 --> 55:51.181
This is not a good idea.

55:52.349 --> 55:54.601
I think it's a heck
of a good idea.

55:55.727 --> 55:58.438
It would be better a little
further south, towards Kampala.

55:59.231 --> 56:03.276
Oh. If I wanted to be closer to
Kampala I'd be closer to Kampala.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.153
But I want to be right here.

56:07.823 --> 56:09.491
What are you saying?
What's he saying?

56:09.574 --> 56:11.118
Said the north is
very dangerous.

56:11.201 --> 56:14.663
Villages in this area are
very remote, Mr Childers.

56:14.997 --> 56:16.206
There's nothing there.

56:16.289 --> 56:19.334
Then I would think that them
people need help the most.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.298
This is a war zone, Mr Childers.

56:25.757 --> 56:27.551
The IRA will kill you.

56:29.553 --> 56:32.097
Look, I don't think you
understand what I'm saying,

56:32.180 --> 56:34.558
so let me make it
real clear to you.

56:36.143 --> 56:38.020
I'm buying this land.

56:38.311 --> 56:40.480
<i>This is what can unite us.</i>

56:40.897 --> 56:43.025
<i>Arabism cannot unite us.</i>

56:43.108 --> 56:46.862
<i>Africanism that is opposed
to Orba cannot unite us.</i>

56:47.571 --> 56:49.489
<i>Islam cannot unite us.</i>

56:49.781 --> 56:53.618
<i>But Sudanism, Sudanism
can unite us</i>

56:53.702 --> 56:56.038
<i>because it is a common factor.</i>

57:33.283 --> 57:35.827
I told you. Stay out of there.

57:36.870 --> 57:38.747
You'll get all dirty.

57:39.706 --> 57:42.626
- Sure you don't want to play someplace else?
- No.

57:43.335 --> 57:44.419
No.

57:47.923 --> 57:50.050
- Sam.
- Yeah.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.719
This is Betty.
She's from Kotido.

57:52.969 --> 57:54.387
Hey, Betty. How are ya?

57:54.471 --> 57:56.139
I'm fine, how are you?

57:56.223 --> 57:57.516
I'm okay.

57:57.599 --> 58:00.185
She knows you need
someone to run the orphanage.

58:00.268 --> 58:01.436
Yeah.

58:01.728 --> 58:02.979
I said stay out of there.

58:03.063 --> 58:06.233
I'm looking for somebody, help
me keep the place in order,

58:06.983 --> 58:08.944
look after things
while I'm away.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.529
She can do this.

58:10.612 --> 58:12.656
And now, what about
the children?

58:12.739 --> 58:16.201
Can she feed the children?
Fix them up when they're sick?

58:16.451 --> 58:17.494
Can she do that?

58:23.792 --> 58:25.252
She's hired.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.546
Thank you.

58:41.977 --> 58:43.687
You say your prayers
or something?

58:43.770 --> 58:45.313
I already did.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.360
All right. Sweet dreams.

58:50.443 --> 58:51.987
Ain't you gonna read me a book?

58:53.238 --> 58:54.739
No.

58:57.742 --> 58:59.286
Then let's play a game.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.537
Yeah.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.749
I'm thinking of a dog.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.544
What about it?

59:09.379 --> 59:11.131
Never mind, Donnie.

59:12.007 --> 59:13.383
All right.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.679
My dad usually gives me a kiss on
the forehead before he leaves.

59:19.014 --> 59:20.682
You can do that.

59:22.225 --> 59:24.519
Yeah. Sure.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.610
Night, Donnie.

59:32.652 --> 59:34.154
Sweet dreams

59:39.367 --> 59:41.578
<i>♪ Busy, busy everybody's busy</i>

59:41.661 --> 59:43.163
<i>♪ Playing the game of life</i>

01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:02.933
<i>♪ But now it's time
to say a rhyme</i>

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.184
♪ <i>Let's all have some fun</i> ♪

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.411
- How many are there?
- Around 20.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.127
Where are your men?

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:32.462
Down there.

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:38.051
Get me a gun.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.152
We've got to get everyone back to the church.
That's our best shot.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.196
I'm going to get the kids.
Cover me.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.668
Betty, Betty, bring them to the church!
Come on.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.022
Come on.
Tell them to stay together.

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.024
Stay close.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.526
Come on.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.361
Get down!

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:41.948
Go on.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.086
Get them in.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.852
Okay, get in the corner.
Get in the corner.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.901
Get in the corner!
Get in the corner!

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.027
All right, you'll be fine.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.280
Come on, come on.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.234
Hello?

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.902
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:44.904
You okay?

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.073
<i>It's all gone. All of it.</i>

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.077
They burnt it down.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.662
Nothing left.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:56.916
Where are you?

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:58.626
Nimule.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.920
<i>It's a test, Sam.</i>

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:05.425
<i>I can't do it no more, Lynn.
It's over.</i>

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.303
<i>Sam.</i>

01:04:09.053 --> 01:04:10.221
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.182
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:14.809
Yeah, I can hear you.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:18.730
<i>Them kids have had their whole lives
burnt to the ground and worse.</i>

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:20.857
<i>How many of them you
see giving up?</i>

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.611
God gave you purpose,
Sam Childers.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:29.157
<i>Now get off your butt, stop your
crying and build it again.</i>

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.701
You hear me?

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.313
Cut it all down.

01:05:02.106 --> 01:05:04.526
<i>Till they got nowhere to hide.</i>

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:11.407
Up. Down.

01:05:57.662 --> 01:06:00.790
All right, outfielders.
Stand nice and spread out.

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:02.583
Hey, what's this?

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.378
No patty cakes. None of that.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.840
You're the short stop.
You're here. Don't move.

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:11.968
Poppy, you ready?

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.387
Remember what I said?

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.766
Put your right hand
there, left hand there.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:21.227
Now you swing through.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.812
There you go.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.565
Yeah?

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.150
- You look great, Poppy.
- Yeah.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.402
You look great.
Matak, pay attention.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.322
- Ready to pitch? ls everybody ready?
- Yes.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.575
Everybody ready, outfield?
All right.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.287
Let's play baseball.
All right, Matak.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.913
Nice and easy.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.708
Give me a pitch.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:45.752
What are you doing?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.755
Don't kick the ball.
What are you doing?

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:51.466
It's supposed to be baseball.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.527
What happened?

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.738
There was an attack
outside Adjumani.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.633
What's she saying?

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.135
She's asking what she did wrong.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.139
You didn't do nothing wrong.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.354
She wants to know if
you are the preacher.

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:50.691
I'm the preacher.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:55.071
You tell her she's
going to be okay.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.310
- Where you going?
- Adjumani.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:30.731
Sam. Sam, please wait.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.734
No, I ain't waiting around
no more for this to happen.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.403
See what waiting gets you?

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.350
Shit.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.397
Marco, no! Marco!

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:55.775
Don't fire that thing!

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.194
There's kids behind the truck!

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.547
RPG!

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.245
You okay?

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:29.744
It's okay.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:49.467
Hey, buddy.

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:55.806
Ain't you gonna say nothing?

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:00.102
I'll see you later.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:06.484
I see you have a bodyguard.

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:07.735
Guess I do.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.700
Take care of things
while I'm gone, okay?

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.535
- I will, Preacher.
- All right.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.294
You can't come with me, buddy.

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:30.508
Come on.

01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:49.151
In your actions, you give
service to the Lord.

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:54.114
He's not interested in your good intentions.
Your good thoughts.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:59.787
No, He wants your backs.
Your hands. Your sweat.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:05.376
Your blood to pour into the foundation
that will build up His kingdom!

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:07.127
- Amen!
- Amen!

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:12.967
- What do you think?
- I think it's great.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:15.636
Started day care last month.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.513
Monday through Friday
from 8:00 to 2:00.

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:21.100
Sundays after first worship for a
few hours if anybody needs it.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:27.064
I'm thinking maybe we could
set up a playground...

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:30.484
some swings, some things
that kids can climb on.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:32.653
No, we can't build any more.
Not for a while.

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:34.405
You said Sundays has been full.

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:38.659
Yeah, it's been full, but that doesn't
mean people are giving money like today.

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:43.455
You know, economy's slow, construction
business is slow. Times is tight.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:48.252
- Be good for them kids, Lynn.
- Yeah, well, they got the playground

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:49.378
over at Cairnbrook,

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:51.380
and they can play at the school
on the weekends if they want.

01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:54.425
No, no.
No, I'm talking about Africa.

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:59.179
I heard you built yourself one hell
of a church over there in Central City.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.349
Yeah, we set it up pretty good,
but we still got a ways to go.

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:05.686
Anyways, Bill.
The reason I called you...

01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:07.396
the reason I'm here is because

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:11.358
I wanted to talk to you...
a little bit more about our Outreach Programme.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:13.485
You know, the thing we're
doing over there in Africa.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.613
Of course, I know about what
you're doing over there.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.909
I mean, hell of a thing, Sam, helping
out those kids. God bless you.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.953
Thank you, Bill.
I appreciate that. I do.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:26.665
But I gotta be straight with you.
We are hurting for money.

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.252
Now if we had the support of
good people like yourselves,

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:32.379
sure would help things go a
lot smoother over there.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.215
Sam, everybody around here
is feeling the pinch.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.259
I hear that, Bill. I do.

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:40.429
But if you once could just see
what it is we're doing down there.

01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:44.642
I mean, it's about more than the money.
And I ain't asking for a lot.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:48.312
- How much you looking for?
- $5,000 or something.

01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:50.272
Jesus Christ, Sam. $5,000?

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:52.524
Come on, Bill. That ain't
hardly gonna put you out there

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.777
- on the street now, is it?
- Well, that's not the point.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.113
And that's gonna keep them doors
open for another six months.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.407
Look around here.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.826
People are losing their
jobs left and right.

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.204
It's tough to go asking
for $5,000 for a bunch

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:07.456
of African children
halfway around the world.

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:09.625
Bill, I understand that -
we got problems right here,

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.211
- but this is a different kind of problem.
- Different, how?

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:14.713
That orphanage is the
last hope these kids got.

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:18.550
Now with that kind of money, we can
feed them kids, house them kids.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.011
Buy me a new generator
which is sorely needed.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:24.223
I gotta tell you, Bill, you would
be saving a hell of a lot of lives.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.562
All right. Here's what I'll do.
I'll see what I can come up with.

01:17:31.855 --> 01:17:33.107
- Okay.
- All right.

01:17:33.857 --> 01:17:35.985
- Okay, Bill.
- Okay.

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:39.571
Hey, why don't you bring the
family over next Sunday.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.198
We're having a little
bit of a barbeque.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:47.371
Well, come on in.
You all must be the Childers, welcome.

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:50.290
I am Shannon, Bill's
ball and chain.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:54.420
- I'm Lynn. This here is Paige.
- Good to meet you.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:18:00.092
There he is.
Hey, Sam, glad you all could make it.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:03.053
- Oh, who's this lovely young lady?
- Paige.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.889
I'll tell you what.
You come on in here and you meet some people.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:08.767
This is the gentleman I
was telling you about.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:32.833
Sam. There you are.

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:37.546
A little something for the kids out there.
What we were talking about earlier.

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.923
- Thank you.
- Yeah, don't mention it.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:58.067
- Why are we leaving so soon?
- Get in the car.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:01.111
- Is everything all right?
- Thank you.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:02.613
What is wrong?

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:06.575
Son of a bitch is crying
poor-mouth to me,

01:19:06.658 --> 01:19:09.369
and he's living in
a damn Taj Mahal.

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:16.251
I asked him for $5,000 to feed
a bunch of motherless babies.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:20.172
And you know what he gave me?
150 bucks.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.884
He spent more than that
on salsa for his party.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:29.515
We are locked in a
fight with the devil.

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:35.604
Now I can't do this on my own.
I can't take the pressure

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.941
and the pain and the loneliness.

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:41.819
I need each one of
you to back me up.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:46.240
And I need you all to bring your game.
And the Lord will raise you up!

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:47.616
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:49.159
Hallelujah!

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:53.872
If we have to cut back,
then the devil has won.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.501
<i>And we don'!
Want the devil to win, do we?</i>

01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:58.836
<i>No!</i>

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:10.139
I'm sorry, but 2,500 is the
best I can do for those guns.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.016
Tell you what.
Throw in the car for five.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:17.938
Almost there.

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:26.530
Hands over eyes.
Micrah, no cheating. No cheating.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:31.118
Just a little bit more.
Okay, stop.

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:33.787
Open your eyes.

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:35.831
Yeah!

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:43.630
Come on.

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.179
Thank you.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:51.471
It's all right.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.908
It's good to see the kids laugh.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.702
Amen to that.

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:20.167
Listen, I would like to add a few
more guards to you during the day.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:21.418
Why?

01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:24.254
Because Kony's offering
money for your head.

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:28.508
- Offering money for my head?
- Yes.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.975
I must be doing something right.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:47.486
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of myself.

01:21:53.116 --> 01:21:54.743
He said anything yet?

01:21:55.661 --> 01:22:00.082
All we know is that him and his
brother were taken by the rebels.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.542
- Where's his brother?
- We don't know.

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:14.763
You don't want to go play
with the other kids?

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:21.478
You know, sometimes it
helps to tell somebody

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:23.897
what you got locked up inside.

01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:44.376
I've done a lot of things
that I ain't proud of.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:47.796
Hurt a lot of people.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:55.387
Truth is, helping you kids is about the only
good thing I've ever done in this life.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:03.770
But I'm scared that...
one day I'll...

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:10.068
close my eyes to all this and
make it somebody else's problem.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:20.329
You got no idea what
I'm saying, do you?

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.056
Who's that?

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.317
It's our leader.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.445
John Garang?

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:06.666
So, they call you the White Preacher.
Is this what I should call you?

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.253
You can call me Sam.

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:14.508
I hear what you are doing for the
children of Sudan and I'm grateful.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.343
I just wanted to see it myself.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:21.056
Well, this is it.
We've got a couple hundred with us here.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:25.394
Feed another thousand a
day, nearby villages.

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:29.022
And you do this.
And yet these are not your people.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.982
The struggle is not your own.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.528
Yeah, well, I've kinda
made it my struggle.

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:37.072
Till someone else starts fighting
the fight for these children,

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.032
then I'm the one
that's gonna do it.

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:41.201
- You're just stubborn, aren't you?
- As a mule.

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.831
I wish I had more men like you.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:50.794
There are peace talks scheduled
for the end of August in Russia.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.339
I would like you to
come as my guest.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:25:00.804
You know, talking about peace in a room
somewhere is a waste of time, if you ask me.

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:03.098
You gotta go out and make it.

01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:06.059
You speak what is on your mind.
I heard this about you.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.437
Really? What else did you hear?

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.148
Well, I heard that you
don't suffer fools.

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:14.443
And that you like a good fight.

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:16.820
I heard you were taller.

01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:21.116
So you see, we're not
so dissimilar, Sam.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:24.327
You made the fight for these
children your struggle.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:27.998
And I made the freedom of
Southern Sudan my struggle.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.625
But part of my struggle
happens in these rooms.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:32.335
I hear you.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.841
So you think maybe we could convince
you to come to peace talks one day?

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.427
Maybe.

01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:50.729
Should be coming out soon.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.275
Anybody see anything?

01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:57.819
Marco! See something?

01:25:58.236 --> 01:25:59.529
Nothing. Nothing.

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:02.699
I don't know.

01:26:10.957 --> 01:26:13.627
Should be around here.
You should pull over.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.595
- The intel was very clear.
- I don't see nothing.

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:25.972
This is it.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.227
No, wait, wait.
There. I got two.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:32.938
Right there.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:46.159
Come on.
Come on, it's okay. Come on.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:51.706
Okay, they ain't moving.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:54.084
AJ, Nineteen. Go get those kids.

01:26:54.125 --> 01:26:58.046
Deng, call camp, tell them we're coming
back with two, possibly injured.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.186
Be careful.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:30.745
What'd he say?

01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:33.665
What's he saying?

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:34.833
AJ is dead!

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.926
Tell him don't move. Okay?

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:46.219
Don't move!

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:49.723
Stay down!

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.683
Ask him if he saw the shooter.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:58.148
Did not see him.

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:08.241
- You see him?
- He's on the ridge. Within the rocks.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.744
Can you reach the Mauser?

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:23.590
When I say go, I want you to put all
you got into those rocks up there.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:25.383
Ready?

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:27.510
Go!

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:31.032
- Hello?
- Sam, <i>it's</i> me, man.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.288
Donnie.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.502
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

01:29:43.586 --> 01:29:48.133
<i>Yeah, everybody's great, man.
I'm just calling to say hey, that's all.</i>

01:29:50.176 --> 01:29:51.261
Hey.

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:54.806
How are the girls?

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:56.349
<i>Oh, they're doing great, man.</i>

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.977
Yeah, Paige made us
dinner the other night.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.603
Chocolate chip pancakes.

01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:02.981
<i>By herself, huh?</i>

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:06.651
Yeah. All by herself.
I mean, I helped her with the stove.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.487
But, you know, she
mixed it all up.

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.990
<i>They were real good,</i> too.

01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:18.121
So, how's it going over there?

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.083
<i>It's going fine, buddy.</i>

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:24.043
Yeah?

01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:27.630
Man, that must be wild. I'd like to come
over there sometime, check it out, you know?

01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:30.216
<i>Get the hell out of
here for a while.</i>

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:32.844
<i>That'd be nice.
See what that's like.</i>

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:36.055
Sounds good.

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:40.393
<i>- Hey, Sam, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.</i>

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:46.357
You really think... God's gonna
forgive us for everything we done?

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.961
Is that all the
soy milks we got?

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:18.932
They talk about you in the camps.
The children.

01:31:20.099 --> 01:31:23.186
They say there is a white
preacher who hunts the IRA.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.689
This place does not need
more guns, Mr Childers.

01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:29.317
Just trying to help these people.
Same as you.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:35.365
Don't delude yourself. You're a mercenary...
not a humanitarian.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:38.117
I got 200 kids that are
gonna sleep safe tonight.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:41.955
Right or wrong, that's
all the reason I need.

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:43.998
That's how it always starts.

01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:47.252
With people thinking that they're
killing for the right reasons.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:50.755
Why don't you fight the evil
in this place your way,

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:52.507
and let me fight it mine.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:56.386
They say you're doing good,
that you have special powers.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:59.889
You're protected by angels and
can't be killed by bullets.

01:32:01.057 --> 01:32:03.893
They said the same thing about
Kony in the beginning, too.

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:58.489
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:13.963
Preacher.

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:43.242
Let's get them out of here.

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:47.163
Deng, tell them that we're
not going to hurt them.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:51.250
Okay, in the light.
That's good. That's good.

01:33:54.837 --> 01:33:56.798
We don't have room
for all of them.

01:33:57.090 --> 01:34:00.968
- How many can we fit in the truck?
- Twenty, 25 maximum.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.722
What have we got? Like 40?

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.688
Okay. All right. You, you go.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.565
You. You go. You, go.

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:16.025
What are you doing?

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:20.279
You. You go. You. You.
We gotta take as many as we can.

01:34:20.363 --> 01:34:22.740
We gotta take the little ones,
and the ones that are sick,

01:34:22.824 --> 01:34:24.200
we'll come back for
the other ones later.

01:34:24.283 --> 01:34:27.453
Marco, Adeem.
Take these ones here on the truck.

01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:31.499
- We should call for backup.
- No, we got no time. We take the ones we can.

01:34:32.041 --> 01:34:37.755
You, you go. Yeah, you go. Go, go.
All right. You, stay, stay.

01:34:39.298 --> 01:34:41.509
Okay, tell the other ones
we'll come back later.

01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:44.512
Tell them.

01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:58.860
Don't come back
until you see my face.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:00.445
Wait!

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.782
- Hey, hey!
- Get in here.

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:08.202
Tell them to hide.
Don't move till they see my face.

01:35:09.245 --> 01:35:12.957
Deng! Get in.
I don't have no more space.

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.503
I'll be back in two hours.
Two hours.

01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:19.297
Two hours we'll be back.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:38.608
Marley, gas it up,
we're leaving in five.

01:37:09.365 --> 01:37:12.076
Sudan?
What are you doing over there?

01:37:37.476 --> 01:37:39.562
Hey, sorry, man. Sorry.

01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:42.648
Route 16 was all backed up.

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:49.864
Welcome home, buddy. Yeah.

01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:55.119
You must be wiped out, man.
Yeah, I'm sorry, 16 was a fucking mess.

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:57.038
All these assholes out
driving at night...

01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:00.249
Shut up. Shut up.
Open your eyes, wake up.

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:02.460
Wake up! Shut up!

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:07.173
You call yourselves the children of God?
Well, you ain't.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:12.219
No, y'all just sheep following Him.
Deaf, dumb and blind.

01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:14.847
But God don't want sheep!

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:17.224
Praise the Lord.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:19.936
He wants wolves to
fight his fight!

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:21.938
<i>Amen! Amen!</i>

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:27.944
Men and women with teeth to tear
at the evil that is out there!

01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:34.241
The Lord's prophets are
not men in fancy clothes.

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:37.536
They're warrior prophets!

01:38:37.912 --> 01:38:44.877
They're men of conviction, who ain't afraid
to pick up a sword and use it! Why not?

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:50.841
Soldiers willing to fight against
His enemies, wherever they may be!

01:38:52.927 --> 01:38:57.139
<i>Soldiers willing to fight
till their last breath.</i>

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:02.561
- Hallelujah! Wake up!
- Hallelujah!

01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:04.981
I want you to look at this.

01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:07.191
- It's a 10-year-old boy.
- Sam...

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:11.737
- He had his arms cut off. Just hacked off.
- This is not necessary. It's not necessary.

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:13.572
Could you come back
in a minute, please?

01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:16.826
- Please.
- Look, I only got one truck over there.

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:22.248
I need the money to get another vehicle.
Now I found this one in Kampala that I can get.

01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:23.499
We already took out a
second on your home.

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:25.001
I got a real good deal, I
just need you to get...

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:27.753
Sam, we know what you're doing over
there in Africa, and we support it.

01:39:27.837 --> 01:39:30.715
But I'm telling you, we cannot
give you any more money.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:34.635
- You hear what I'm saying? Look at this.
- Sam, you're completely leveraged.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:36.220
- See this?
- Yes.

01:39:36.303 --> 01:39:39.473
This girl watched her family being
killed and then they set her on fire.

01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:40.725
This is not necessary.

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.310
No, no, no. John, just look at...
John. John, look at the picture.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:45.271
- I do see it. I'm looking, Sam.
- Look at the picture.

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:48.816
Now, I ain't asking for money
for a hot tub or a vacation

01:39:48.899 --> 01:39:50.401
- or something like that.
- Company policy says...

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:54.822
I'm asking for an extra vehicle so that
I can save some children, John, okay?

01:39:54.905 --> 01:39:57.116
- Do you understand that?
- I do, but I'm telling you...

01:39:57.199 --> 01:39:58.659
But nothing!

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:03.247
But nothing! Now, I need you to
get in your little book there

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.999
and do whatever it is you
gotta do to get me that car!

01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:07.251
- Sam, you need to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:10.129
Mary Strauss and them's
having dinner at the Chimney.

01:40:10.212 --> 01:40:12.965
- Who's her date?
- Tony Wilkes.

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:16.302
I thought Tony Wilkes was going
with Patty Hobbes' daughter?

01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:18.137
They broke up last month.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:21.766
Sudanese
opposition leader.

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.977
<i>John Garang has been killed
in a helicopter crash.</i>

01:40:25.061 --> 01:40:28.939
<i>That's according to a statement released
by the Sudanese government in Khartoum.</i>

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.609
<i>Garang was hailed as a
peacemaker in Sudan</i>

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.320
<i>and was instrumental in
ending the 21-year civil war</i>

01:40:34.403 --> 01:40:35.738
<i>that has ravaged that country.</i>

01:40:35.821 --> 01:40:36.864
Dad.

01:40:36.947 --> 01:40:40.284
<i>Six of Garang's associates and seven
others also died in the crash</i>

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:42.536
<i>which is being blamed
on bad weather.</i>

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:45.498
What do you think about us
getting a limo for next weekend?

01:40:45.581 --> 01:40:48.084
Wouldn't be too expensive
since there'd be six of us.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:49.293
What do you think?

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:55.716
Hello? Earth to Dad.

01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:57.593
Honey. You okay?

01:40:58.636 --> 01:40:59.929
Oh, heck, I'll
just take you all.

01:41:00.930 --> 01:41:03.599
We ain't cramming in the
back of your Caprice.

01:41:03.682 --> 01:41:05.226
Fit in there easy.
You're little.

01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:08.270
We got dresses, Donnie.
We'll get all wrinkled.

01:41:08.354 --> 01:41:10.397
Plus it smells in there.

01:41:11.023 --> 01:41:13.359
Yeah, I'll squirt some
perfume You'll be all right.

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:17.571
Dad, what do you think?
Can we get a limo?

01:41:21.367 --> 01:41:23.410
Dad, please, Patty and
them's getting one.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:29.083
We could probably get a deal
through one of Tom Hickey's boys.

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:31.502
Wouldn't cost too much
between six of them.

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:34.171
You ain't spending money
on no freaking limousine.

01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:37.842
- But, Dad...
- What the hell did I just say?

01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:40.219
Honey, we're just
talking about it.

01:41:40.302 --> 01:41:43.139
Yeah, well there's too
much talk in this house.

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:44.974
I got mouths to feed.

01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:47.768
You're talking about pissing
money away on a limo.

01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:51.939
But it's my formal, Dad.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:57.111
I don't give a shit what it is!
Okay? You ain't getting no limo.

01:41:59.572 --> 01:42:01.615
You love them black babies
more than you love me!

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.827
- Watch your mouth, little girl! Before I slap it...
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:42:04.869 --> 01:42:07.288
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Take it easy, bro.

01:42:07.329 --> 01:42:10.291
Don't tell me to take it easy
in my own fucking house!

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:12.459
All right?
Now that ain't your wife.

01:42:12.543 --> 01:42:14.128
And this ain't your family.

01:42:14.837 --> 01:42:17.882
You ain't nothing but a stray
fucking dog around here.

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.551
You don't mean that.

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:23.929
Like hell I don't.
Now get the fuck out of here.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.183
Before I put your face
through that fucking wall.

01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:02.593
You that preacher, ain't ya?

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:04.511
Yeah, you him.

01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:07.473
I seen your face in the
papers a few years ago.

01:43:11.936 --> 01:43:14.021
- Yeah.
- Told you this is the guy.

01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:19.151
God damn, I knew it.

01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:25.157
The papers were talking about you as some
kind of African Rambo or something, right?

01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:28.410
If you don't mind, I'd just
like to sit here right now.

01:43:28.494 --> 01:43:31.372
You still helping them
niggers over there'?

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.626
See, the way I figure it,

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:40.506
the reason you're so interested
in helping them porch monkeys

01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:43.717
is probably 'cause you throwing it
in them nigger bitches, ain't ya?

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:15.165
You're gonna sit there and
you're gonna let me talk.

01:44:17.793 --> 01:44:20.045
I've always believed in you.

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:23.465
Trusted you, trusted the Lord.

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:27.219
And do what I could so you
could follow your dream.

01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:31.598
But I ain't willing to lose you
to what you're doing over there.

01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:39.189
Ain't just gonna sit back and
watch you get swallowed up by it.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:45.738
Now I know that you're all them kids got
over there, but you're all we got, too.

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:48.949
Paige needs her father.

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:52.786
Damn it, Sam, I need my husband.

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:10.804
Shit, man,
where the hell are you?

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.980
<i>This is Sam.
Leave a message.</i>

01:45:21.482 --> 01:45:23.192
<i>It's Donnie, man.</i>

01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:27.654
Shit, I was hoping
you'd be there.

01:45:31.533 --> 01:45:33.702
I wanna talk to you.

01:45:38.957 --> 01:45:40.959
It's no big deal.

01:45:41.043 --> 01:45:46.131
I was just thinking about...
when we were kids.

01:45:48.217 --> 01:45:52.763
And in the summertime we'd go over
to that quarry near Montrose.

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:55.557
Remember that?

01:45:56.975 --> 01:46:00.771
Yeah, we'd bring our ropes.

01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:05.234
<i>Or go swimming.</i>

01:46:08.153 --> 01:46:10.864
<i>Climb around on the
walls all day.</i>

01:46:19.415 --> 01:46:22.042
I wish you was here
to pray with me.

01:46:37.933 --> 01:46:42.438
A lot of youse want me to stand up
here and make some sense out of this.

01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:49.445
Tell you there's some meaning.

01:46:51.989 --> 01:46:56.368
You know, maybe there's a purpose
for what happened to Donnie.

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:00.998
That's why you came here today.

01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:07.045
You want me to tell you that God
has His plan for all of us and...

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:09.423
when it's time to
call us on home...

01:47:09.506 --> 01:47:11.216
He's just gonna do it.

01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:17.097
That's what you want me to say.

01:47:19.433 --> 01:47:21.852
But that's not what
I'm gonna tell you.

01:47:29.818 --> 01:47:32.404
Mom, who are those men?

01:47:35.073 --> 01:47:36.575
I don't know.

01:47:36.742 --> 01:47:39.411
- Hey, does this go?
- No, I don't think that goes.

01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:42.122
- Excuse me. What are you doing?
- Loading up.

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:45.751
Sam! What is going on?
What is...

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:48.003
- This is the last of the tools.
- Where they taking our stuff?

01:47:48.086 --> 01:47:49.338
Ain't ours no more.

01:47:49.379 --> 01:47:52.174
You best go through it and make sure they
ain't taking anything that belongs...

01:47:52.257 --> 01:47:53.926
Hey, don't you touch that.

01:47:55.636 --> 01:47:58.138
Baby, I know you're hurting.

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:00.641
I know you're angry, but we
need to talk about this.

01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:03.310
It's all done.
So save your breath.

01:48:07.272 --> 01:48:08.815
You sold the business?

01:48:11.568 --> 01:48:12.653
You sold the business?

01:48:12.736 --> 01:48:15.572
- I need a new truck for the orphanage.
- A new truck?

01:48:15.656 --> 01:48:20.994
You sold the business for a new truck?
That was our future, Paige's future, Sam.

01:48:21.495 --> 01:48:23.664
Everything that we have has
gone to those children.

01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:27.167
There's a point, baby, where
there ain't no more to give.

01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:29.878
What's the combination?

01:48:31.964 --> 01:48:33.507
What's the combination?

01:48:34.675 --> 01:48:36.093
Paige's birthday.

01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:41.807
You don't know it, do you?

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:44.476
You don't remember your
own daughter's birthday.

01:48:46.979 --> 01:48:49.356
You fight for everyone, but us.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.692
That's all we got.

01:48:58.156 --> 01:49:00.742
You can make it up
with the ministry.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.829
What ministry, Sam?

01:49:03.912 --> 01:49:06.540
They see how far gone you are,
they see what you've become.

01:49:08.166 --> 01:49:12.838
- You need to get quiet with the Lord.
- No, you know what? I'm done with the Lord.

01:49:12.921 --> 01:49:15.841
No, don't you say that.
Don't you turn your back on Him.

01:49:15.924 --> 01:49:18.010
He turned His back on me.

01:49:19.344 --> 01:49:22.931
Where is He, Lynn?
Where is the Lord now?

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.393
'Cause I don't see Him around here.
Did He save Donnie?

01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:30.063
Did He save those kids?
I gotta save those kids.

01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:34.860
Please don't leave.

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:49.416
Welcome back.

01:50:52.187 --> 01:50:53.939
Don't reverse. Don't reverse.

01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:55.649
- They are going to kill us.
- No, they won't.

01:50:59.569 --> 01:51:01.696
If you move, they're
gonna shoot.

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.907
Calm down, I'm going
to go talk to them.

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:10.414
It's okay, we're a relief convoy.
Relief convoy.

01:51:11.289 --> 01:51:13.750
We've only got medical
supplies, we're non-military.

01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:12.809
The men no longer trust you
to lead them into battle.

01:52:14.311 --> 01:52:16.396
They say you have a wish to die.

01:52:18.356 --> 01:52:20.025
I'm worried about my friend.

01:52:29.826 --> 01:52:31.578
I don't need your help.

01:53:10.492 --> 01:53:11.535
Yeah?

01:54:02.711 --> 01:54:05.297
I remember my parents
when I sleep.

01:54:09.301 --> 01:54:11.261
My father was big like you.

01:54:14.764 --> 01:54:16.308
They shot him.

01:54:21.605 --> 01:54:23.940
The rebels gave me a club.

01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:26.192
And told me...

01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:32.073
if I did not kill my mother,

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:37.871
they'll shoot my brother and me.

01:54:46.504 --> 01:54:48.632
And so I killed my mother.

01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:00.935
If we allow ourselves
to be full of hate...

01:55:03.772 --> 01:55:05.106
then they've won.

01:55:07.942 --> 01:55:10.111
We must not let them
take our hearts.

01:57:07.896 --> 01:57:09.272
Baby, can you get that?

01:57:15.945 --> 01:57:19.407
- Hello?
- Bug? You there?

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:22.994
Dad?

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.079
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

01:57:26.414 --> 01:57:27.916
Are you okay?

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.462
I'm thinking of a tree.

01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:39.803
You said tree, I'm
thinking of a knee.

01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:40.929
<i>You said knee.</i> ..

01:57:42.514 --> 01:57:44.432
I'm thinking of a bee.

01:57:47.852 --> 01:57:48.978
I love you, bug.

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.733
I love you too, Dad.

- What's going on?
- An IRA unit has been spotted.

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:30.311
They are moving north
across the border.

01:58:33.857 --> 01:58:37.110
What are we waiting for then?
Gotta go.

01:58:50.415 --> 01:58:54.043
The village outside of Akot says an
IRA caravan came through an hour ago.

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:09.911
Come on.

02:00:14.374 --> 02:00:15.416
Come on.

02:00:55.707 --> 02:00:58.376

02:00:58.459 --> 02:01:00.003
There you go.

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:03.172
Sam. We cannot make them work.

This is the only one we have.

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:17.770
Okay, watch your hand.

02:01:20.148 --> 02:01:23.985
Keep your eyes peeled.
That road back there might still be hot.

02:01:24.652 --> 02:01:26.154
So, be ready.

02:01:26.654 --> 02:01:28.114
What about you, Preacher?

02:01:29.490 --> 02:01:30.783
We're staying.

02:01:34.412 --> 02:01:35.747
Go on, get out of here.

02:06:39.467 --> 02:06:43.012
For me to sit here and give all
kinds of excuses to make it right,

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:44.180
I can't do.

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:47.183
But what I wanna ask
everyone out there,

02:06:47.558 --> 02:06:52.021
everyone that has a child, everyone
that has a brother or a sister,

02:06:52.605 --> 02:06:56.984
if your child or your family
member was abducted today,

02:06:57.068 --> 02:07:00.905
if a madman came in,
a terrorist came in,

02:07:00.988 --> 02:07:04.658
abducted your family
member, or your child,

02:07:04.742 --> 02:07:08.120
and if I said to you, "I can
bring your child home,"

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:11.665
does it matter howl
bring him home?
