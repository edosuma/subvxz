<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.710 --> 00:04.742
DUNCAN: You need to be careful
around Sandrine.

00:04.745 --> 00:06.544
I think she might be
selling us out.

00:06.546 --> 00:08.302
- To who?
- Logan.

00:08.380 --> 00:10.103
We're going to eliminate
a few loose ends.

00:10.183 --> 00:13.483
- A few?
- Duncan, Archer and Kramer.

00:13.485 --> 00:15.051
What do I have to do?

00:15.053 --> 00:16.519
LOGAN:
They're shaped charges.

00:16.521 --> 00:18.955
They're small, powerful,
and untraceable.

00:18.957 --> 00:21.924
I need you to attach one
to each vehicle.

00:21.926 --> 00:23.693
How did your meeting go
with the Vice President?

00:23.695 --> 00:28.530
He said he would be lucky as hell to have
someone like you as his running mate.

00:28.532 --> 00:31.533
You need a fresh face.
Not an elected official.

00:31.535 --> 00:33.702
Someone with instant
name recognition.

00:33.704 --> 00:35.504
I know exactly who
you're describing.

00:35.506 --> 00:39.441
The only question is,
are you interested in running?

00:39.443 --> 00:42.110
You're telling me that
the President is...

00:42.112 --> 00:43.511
Your biological father.

00:43.513 --> 00:46.915
And my husband, is holding
your family hostage?

00:46.917 --> 00:51.519
If my family dies, it's on you!
Not your father, not your husband, you!

00:51.521 --> 00:56.224
I told her everything.
She's the only one, that can stop this...

00:56.226 --> 00:57.826
I need to tell him
I won't do it.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.494
NINA:
I talked to Brian Sanders.

00:59.496 --> 01:03.364
He told me what's going on,
what you've done to his family,

01:03.366 --> 01:04.565
what you're planning.

01:04.566 --> 01:05.900
Is it true?

01:08.904 --> 01:09.970
So?

01:11.173 --> 01:13.541
Is Brian Sanders telling the truth?

01:15.210 --> 01:17.877
Have you taken
his family hostage?

01:17.879 --> 01:20.113
Nina, you need to get
back into bed and rest.

01:20.115 --> 01:23.684
Don't you dare patronize me.
I asked you a question.

01:23.686 --> 01:24.785
Yes.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.554
I didn't have a choice.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.125
- Nina...
- Get away from me!

01:34.428 --> 01:37.130
I'm trying to save your life.

01:37.132 --> 01:38.698
Our family.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.434
- This was the only way.
- This?

01:41.436 --> 01:42.902
Killing the President?

01:42.904 --> 01:44.437
It didn't start there.

01:44.439 --> 01:47.073
- I don't care where it started.
- I made a deal.

01:47.075 --> 01:49.642
Kill a bad man
to save a good woman.

01:53.112 --> 01:55.548
Right or wrong, I was
willing to live with it.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.216
And what about me?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.251
Did you ever wonder if I
would be okay with that?

02:01.287 --> 02:03.522
I want to live.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.990
I do.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.359
More than anything.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.127
But I would rather die
with my dignity,

02:10.130 --> 02:12.497
than live with the shame,

02:12.499 --> 02:14.766
the disgust,

02:14.768 --> 02:17.202
of knowing what you did.

02:17.204 --> 02:20.438
If this is your miracle cure,
I don't want it.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.140
This has to stop. Now.

02:23.142 --> 02:25.042
It's not that simple, Nina.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.411
Sure it is.

02:29.915 --> 02:31.816
What are you doing?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.685
I'm getting the hell out of here.

02:44.329 --> 02:46.264
The bombs are in place.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.599
- When you gonna detonate them?
- When Kincaid is dead.

02:48.601 --> 02:51.302
And the cars are far enough
away from the Sanders' house.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.271
Has Duncan told you his exit plan?

02:53.273 --> 02:55.450
We're meeting at a rest stop off I-95.

02:55.461 --> 02:58.112
Two hours after the President
is declared dead.

02:58.143 --> 03:02.413
Duncan's gonna give us the wire transfer
information there, we'll part ways.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.948
Rest stop. That's good.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.517
We'll take care of it there.

03:07.552 --> 03:09.887
When do I get my money
and my passports?

03:09.889 --> 03:11.821
Right after your partners
are dead.

03:13.057 --> 03:15.491
Right before would be better.

03:15.493 --> 03:18.094
Trust isn't my strong suit.

03:18.096 --> 03:20.030
Okay. Before.

03:26.337 --> 03:27.503
(DOOR OPENING)

03:31.408 --> 03:32.975
Spoke with Duncan.

03:32.977 --> 03:36.612
He wanted you to know,
Sandrine took the bait.

03:36.614 --> 03:39.749
Leaked the fact that you two are
surveilling a federal prosecutor.

03:41.017 --> 03:42.618
How do we know she's the leak?

03:42.620 --> 03:45.988
I mean, these guys got lots of contacts.
Lots of resources.

03:45.990 --> 03:48.324
I told D we should leave you
out of this conversation.

03:48.326 --> 03:50.259
That you couldn't handle the facts.

03:50.261 --> 03:52.928
I'm just saying, "Why?" Why would
they be paying her to spy on us?

03:52.930 --> 03:54.825
We want the same thing.
We're on the same team.

03:54.862 --> 03:56.592
We want the same thing,

03:56.627 --> 03:58.600
but we are most definitely
not on the same team.

03:58.602 --> 04:01.235
When this is over, they're
gonna try and take us out.

04:01.237 --> 04:03.772
And Sandrine'll be
the one who'll do it.

04:03.774 --> 04:06.441
So as much as I like her,
she's gotta go.

04:08.611 --> 04:09.978
Duncan said that?

04:09.980 --> 04:12.447
Yeah.

04:12.449 --> 04:16.384
But we gotta figure out how she's planning
to kill us before we make a move.

04:16.386 --> 04:20.821
In the meantime, play it cool,
act like everything's normal.

04:20.822 --> 04:23.657
You gotta keep your
feelings out of this, man.

04:23.659 --> 04:24.859
It's just business.

04:29.931 --> 04:31.499
So, you ready for this?

04:31.501 --> 04:34.535
- Yeah, positive. It's the only way.
- Good.

04:34.537 --> 04:36.537
Now, talk to Duncan
as soon as he gets back.

04:36.539 --> 04:39.807
Yeah, but I want you to be there.

04:39.809 --> 04:40.975
Absolutely.

04:42.276 --> 04:44.744
I just want you to know,
when this is over...

04:45.580 --> 04:47.615
Let's just get through this, okay?

04:50.951 --> 04:52.519
NINA:
But you raised me.

04:52.521 --> 04:54.454
You're my father.

04:54.456 --> 04:57.124
How could you not
tell me the truth?

04:57.126 --> 05:00.494
I was trying to protect you.
That's all I've ever tried to do.

05:00.496 --> 05:01.995
Then protect me now.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.331
NINA:
Fix this.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.766
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I don't accept that.

05:06.768 --> 05:08.902
It's complicated, Nina.

05:08.904 --> 05:11.170
You're both insane.

05:11.172 --> 05:13.673
I cannot believe this
is actually happening.

05:14.942 --> 05:17.744
DUNCAN: Sawyer, honey,
what are you doing up?

05:17.746 --> 05:19.913
I heard all these people talking.

05:22.382 --> 05:23.516
Mommy.

05:27.254 --> 05:30.022
I'm sorry, honey.
We didn't mean to wake you.

05:30.024 --> 05:31.157
I don't care.

05:31.159 --> 05:33.426
I'm just glad that you're
out of the hospital.

05:33.428 --> 05:35.694
That means that you're
not sick anymore.

05:38.331 --> 05:40.065
I love you so much.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.232
SAWYER:
I love you.

05:43.937 --> 05:46.605
You go back to bed, okay?
It's really late.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.473
BURTON:
I'll take her.

05:48.675 --> 05:51.476
Come on, sweetheart.
I'll read you a story.

05:51.478 --> 05:52.678
BURTON:
Let's race.

05:52.679 --> 05:55.018
Come on. Come on.

05:57.516 --> 06:00.185
She's the reason we're doing this.

06:00.187 --> 06:02.520
She deserves to have a mother.

06:02.522 --> 06:05.223
She deserves to have you
in her life.

06:05.225 --> 06:08.059
She deserves to have a
father who's not a murderer.

06:10.929 --> 06:13.030
I'm calling the police.

06:13.032 --> 06:14.164
I'm ending it.

06:15.266 --> 06:16.500
(DIALING)

06:23.909 --> 06:25.209
I'm sorry.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.712
But you're not calling anyone.

06:31.749 --> 06:33.283
You need to calm down.

06:33.285 --> 06:35.785
- I need to get out of here.
- That's not an option.

06:35.787 --> 06:37.221
What?

06:37.223 --> 06:39.723
You're not thinking
clearly right now.

06:39.725 --> 06:41.791
There's a lot to absorb.

06:41.793 --> 06:43.960
I think you should stay
here until this is over.

06:53.337 --> 06:56.506
(DOOR LOCKING)
You're gonna lock me in?

06:56.508 --> 06:59.142
NINA:
Duncan! Open the door.

06:59.144 --> 07:00.309
What are you doing?

07:00.311 --> 07:01.410
(KNOCKING)

07:01.412 --> 07:03.546
Have you lost your mind?

07:03.548 --> 07:04.880
I am your wife!

07:04.882 --> 07:07.683
Open the door now!
Duncan! (KNOCKING)

07:31.396 --> 07:32.963
BLAIR:
Thank you, everybody.

07:38.570 --> 07:40.237
Followed your advice.

07:40.239 --> 07:42.772
Didn't mention a word to the Attorney
General about my political aspirations.

07:42.774 --> 07:44.807
Just kept it light and breezy.

07:44.809 --> 07:47.610
Light and breezy can get you
a long way in this town.

07:47.612 --> 07:49.079
That's what I hear.

07:49.081 --> 07:50.413
(CHUCKLING)

07:50.415 --> 07:53.283
I'm going to meet my sister.

07:53.285 --> 07:56.352
- How is she?
- Worried about Paul.

07:56.354 --> 07:59.822
Doesn't like the idea of him
going in to surgery, so,

07:59.824 --> 08:02.324
she wants to spend the day together.

08:02.326 --> 08:04.927
She thinks I'm her good luck charm.

08:04.929 --> 08:06.863
I think she might
be wrong about that.

08:11.334 --> 08:12.868
Everything's still on track?

08:13.970 --> 08:15.737
I spoke with Duncan last night.

08:15.739 --> 08:17.239
All systems go.

08:17.241 --> 08:20.642
In 48 hours, things
will be a lot different.

08:20.644 --> 08:23.012
The future of this country
will be in our hands.

08:27.017 --> 08:29.234
- Where's Sandrine?
- With Kramer.

08:29.274 --> 08:30.934
They left together last night.

08:31.154 --> 08:33.655
- You find anything?
- Nada.

08:33.657 --> 08:35.590
No clue how she plans to do this.

08:37.693 --> 08:40.061
Not too many options.

08:40.063 --> 08:42.960
Either she's gonna clip us
in person, or set us up.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.599
Yeah. About that.
I've been thinkin'.

08:45.601 --> 08:48.702
If Sandrine is working for the other
side and their plan is to get rid of us,

08:48.704 --> 08:50.972
what makes you think they're
gonna pay up when this is over?

08:50.974 --> 08:53.341
Money's already been wired.

08:53.343 --> 08:56.577
It's being held by a third party, someone
Creasy and I agreed upon months ago.

08:56.579 --> 09:00.214
The moment the President dies, he'll
send me the account information.

09:00.216 --> 09:03.884
So as long as Dr. Sanders
comes through, we're good.

09:03.886 --> 09:05.453
We're good.

09:05.455 --> 09:08.255
Then let's make sure
homegirl delivers.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.424
Been a long few weeks.

09:10.426 --> 09:13.026
I didn't come all this way for a kiss
on the cheek, you know what I mean?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.563
She'll come through.

09:15.565 --> 09:18.631
She better. Otherwise,
I'll put a bullet in her eye.

09:22.903 --> 09:24.004
(DOOR CLOSING)

09:38.953 --> 09:40.286
What?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.889
We need to talk about the surgery.

09:42.891 --> 09:45.925
I've changed my mind.
I'm not gonna kill him.

09:45.927 --> 09:47.627
That's not an option, Ellen.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.863
- I'm not gonna do it.
- We have an agreement.

09:49.865 --> 09:52.398
Well, things have changed.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.533
There are consequences
to that decision.

09:54.535 --> 09:56.202
And I am prepared to face them.

10:00.073 --> 10:02.274
Look, I know you're doing
this to save your wife.

10:02.276 --> 10:04.656
And despite your threats,
you're not gonna kill my kids.

10:04.726 --> 10:06.978
I know it and you know it.

10:12.685 --> 10:13.986
You're right.

10:15.154 --> 10:16.588
I won't kill them.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.156
But that doesn't matter.

10:18.158 --> 10:20.125
Other people involved will.

10:20.127 --> 10:22.494
Plus, Archer and Sandrine
are in this for the money.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.397
They won't hesitate to finish you off
if you don't go through with this.

10:25.399 --> 10:28.733
We understand the risks.
And we have a proposal for you.

10:30.969 --> 10:32.703
I'm listening.

10:32.705 --> 10:37.408
I'll find a way to get the President's
bone marrow, if you protect my children.

10:37.543 --> 10:39.477
I'm not sure that's even possible.

10:39.479 --> 10:41.679
Do you want to save your wife?
It's the only offer on the table.

10:41.681 --> 10:43.080
(SIGHING)

10:50.255 --> 10:52.023
Okay.

10:52.025 --> 10:53.918
But we want proof
that you'll protect our kids.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.358
Proof?

10:55.393 --> 10:58.028
I hate to break it to you, but your
word isn't worth much around here.

10:58.030 --> 10:59.396
What do you have in mind?

11:06.438 --> 11:10.840
Only two days left, are you planning on
a lot of wardrobe changes or something?

11:13.311 --> 11:14.678
What's the matter?

11:14.680 --> 11:15.812
Nothing.

11:20.051 --> 11:21.551
We have a little time.

11:24.321 --> 11:26.957
Not right now, sorry.

11:26.959 --> 11:29.059
Should I be insulted?

11:29.061 --> 11:32.361
I'm stressed. I can't turn
it on and off like you can.

11:42.239 --> 11:43.772
(WATER RUNNING)

12:20.275 --> 12:22.543
When this is over, I hope
we can keep this going.

12:23.612 --> 12:27.515
You. Me. And my son.

12:27.517 --> 12:30.018
I think you'd really like him.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.053
Well, if he's anything
like his mother...

12:40.094 --> 12:42.396
Look.

12:42.398 --> 12:46.298
Things are crazy right now. Everyone's
worried about the other side of this.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.169
Sometimes...

12:50.472 --> 12:55.307
people do something in the moment that
seems to make sense, but later on doesn't.

12:58.513 --> 13:00.013
If you did do something,

13:01.683 --> 13:03.216

13:04.451 --> 13:06.286
that no longer makes sense,

- Yes.

I'm Dr. Kagan.
One of her oncologists.

I heard she just checked herself out
of the hospital late last night?

14:53.423 --> 14:55.122
Look, I'm concerned.

14:55.124 --> 14:57.658
- Her immune system's very weak right now.
- I know.

It's, uh, it's been a terrible
situation, as you might imagine.

15:01.163 --> 15:03.697
She and her husband made
the decision together.

15:03.699 --> 15:05.432
- So she's at her home?
- Yes.

15:05.434 --> 15:07.134
But I was just there,
it was empty.

15:07.136 --> 15:08.969
She's probably sleeping.

Mr. Delaney, it's very important

15:19.548 --> 15:21.348
I want her to go back
to the hospital.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.350

I'll track her down and
have a talk with her.

15:27.723 --> 15:30.523
I wanna play with Mommy.
Is she done with her nap?

15:30.525 --> 15:34.026
Sawyer, please, I'm just finishing up
with Mommy's doctor.

15:34.028 --> 15:35.694
I just wanted to see her.

15:35.696 --> 15:38.164
I'm confused. Is Nina here?

15:40.467 --> 15:43.502
Sawyer? Are you there?

15:43.504 --> 15:47.740
No. She's at her home in Bethesda.

We're going to visit her later today,

not that easy to take out three armed men.

No matter how good you are.

17:20.597 --> 17:21.964
What are you sayin'?

17:21.967 --> 17:25.201
If I were them, I'd try
to be more efficient.

17:25.203 --> 17:27.403
Get us all at once.

17:27.405 --> 17:28.537

17:49.026 --> 17:50.692

I have been talking.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.694
She mentioned that you
two are good friends.

Is that right?

17:54.131 --> 17:55.797
Spoke very highly of you.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.300
Well, that's good to hear.
Vanessa's an amazing woman.

17:58.302 --> 18:00.067
And one of the smartest
people I know.

18:00.069 --> 18:02.236
And a very capable politician.

18:02.238 --> 18:05.440
So, the reason I called
you here, Colonel...

18:07.943 --> 18:11.746
It's no secret that I'm going to run for
President when Paul's term expires.

18:11.748 --> 18:14.215
And I think that Vanessa would
be a perfect running mate.

18:15.217 --> 18:16.884
In your estimation,

18:18.253 --> 18:20.487
do you believe she's
someone I can trust?

18:51.018 --> 18:54.620
- Thanks for coming over.
- What the hell's going on?

18:54.622 --> 18:58.358
Your sister wants to go to the police.
She won't listen to us.

19:21.515 --> 19:23.349
How did they talk you into this?

19:23.351 --> 19:26.452
It was my decision.
Nobody talked me into anything.

19:26.454 --> 19:28.687
We need to end it.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.923
Look, I don't care what's already happened,
there's nothing we can do about that.

19:31.925 --> 19:34.293
But we have to go to
the police. Right now.

19:34.295 --> 19:36.061
- We can't.
- Why not?

19:36.063 --> 19:38.430
- Because of the President.
- What, you mean my father?

19:38.432 --> 19:41.666
Your father doesn't
know you're alive.

19:41.668 --> 19:45.537
And your very existence is a threat
to him, to his whole hypocrisy.

19:45.539 --> 19:47.271
I'm not very worried about him.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.640
What's he gonna do to me?

just as easily as you could.

19:59.619 --> 20:01.285
You're not making any sense.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.687
He raped your mother
35 years ago,

20:03.689 --> 20:05.756
then tried to have her
killed to cover it up,

20:05.758 --> 20:07.458
if he finds out the truth,

20:07.460 --> 20:10.161
he will eliminate any and all
evidence that it ever happened.

29:14.156 --> 29:16.390
No, no, you've been
a really good girl.

29:16.392 --> 29:18.959
I had a nice nap
and I feel much better now.

29:18.961 --> 29:21.995
- Are you coming out?
- Yeah, um...

29:21.997 --> 29:23.931
But I locked the door by accident.

29:23.933 --> 29:28.268
- Oh, I'll go get Grandpa.
- No. Um... Don't bother Grandpa.

29:28.270 --> 29:31.738
I just... I need you
to do something for me.

29:33.908 --> 29:37.277
Met with Dr. Sanders.
All systems go.

29:37.279 --> 29:38.946
Good.
Did you get what I asked for?

29:39.981 --> 29:41.381
Yes.

29:46.153 --> 29:49.889
Thanks. I'll handle it from here.

29:49.891 --> 29:51.891
Everything will be
in place on the day.

30:04.905 --> 30:06.572
Colonel, hello.

30:06.574 --> 30:09.742
Good to see you.
I had a surprise meeting today.

30:09.744 --> 30:11.077
With the Vice-President.

30:11.079 --> 30:13.279
- Really? How'd it go?
- Mmm.

30:13.281 --> 30:14.981
He asked me an interesting question.

30:14.983 --> 30:17.083
He wanted to know if I thought
you were trustworthy.

30:17.085 --> 30:20.419
- I hope you said yes.
- 'Course I did.

30:20.421 --> 30:21.787
I'm a good liar.

30:21.789 --> 30:22.921
Excuse me?

30:24.691 --> 30:26.958
You're a very clever woman, Vanessa,

30:28.127 --> 30:29.828
but the game isn't over.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.503
Sawyer?

30:39.906 --> 30:41.273
Sawyer?

30:42.708 --> 30:44.575
Where are you?

31:04.092 --> 31:06.226
Why are we here?

31:06.228 --> 31:10.931
We need these guys' help. They'll create
a diversion on the day of the surgery.

31:10.933 --> 31:13.700
You sure you don't
want to wear a wire?

31:13.702 --> 31:15.335
Too risky.

31:15.337 --> 31:17.104
ARCHER:
It's risky not to wear one.

31:18.706 --> 31:20.340
Want me to quiz you?

31:20.342 --> 31:22.408
No, I'm good.
I know this cover inside out.

31:22.410 --> 31:26.946
You're here to watch my back, but don't
interfere unless things go south.

31:26.948 --> 31:28.080
Copy that.

31:30.384 --> 31:33.119
This has to work, so be patient.

31:35.122 --> 31:37.322
How patient?

31:37.324 --> 31:39.992
Wait for a gunshot.

31:39.994 --> 31:42.294
That's not patient.
That's stupid.

31:53.506 --> 31:56.375
I told our leader all about your plan.
He's excited.

31:56.377 --> 31:57.742
Good.

31:59.345 --> 32:02.781
This is the guy I was telling you about.
Donald Carter.

32:02.783 --> 32:06.351
Nice to meet you.
Heard good things.

32:06.353 --> 32:09.321
Steve says you guys did some
business a few months back.

32:09.323 --> 32:11.990
Yeah, a few deals, we got to
know each other a little bit.

32:11.992 --> 32:13.591
That's why I came to you.

32:13.593 --> 32:16.227
I'm flattered.

32:16.229 --> 32:20.231
What I meant was we both
share a similar philosophy

32:20.233 --> 32:23.601
about the government
and the President.

32:24.837 --> 32:27.137
I'm told you have a plan
already in place.

32:27.139 --> 32:31.041
I've been working on this for a few
months, but I'm still shorthanded.

32:31.043 --> 32:36.847
I need a few more smart, skilled men,
and we can do the unthinkable.

32:36.849 --> 32:40.618
We can take down the President
of the United States.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.620
Tell me more.

32:42.622 --> 32:45.723
I have a mole in the Secret Service,
gave me everything.

32:45.725 --> 32:50.127
Times, security codes,
rotations, you name it.

32:50.129 --> 32:51.494
That sounds good.

32:52.663 --> 32:54.464
Too good.

32:54.466 --> 32:57.300
Usually that means
there's a cop involved.

32:57.302 --> 32:59.569
You calling me a snitch?

32:59.571 --> 33:02.606
He's legit, man.
We've done a lot of work together.

33:09.447 --> 33:14.351
We're gonna run your information,
make sure you are who you say you are.

33:17.988 --> 33:23.059
Sawyer and I are leaving.
Please don't try and follow us.

33:25.028 --> 33:30.133
Please, just let her
live somewhere else.

33:30.135 --> 33:34.002
Away from you and all the craziness.

33:37.340 --> 33:41.644
I loved you my whole life.
You broke my heart.

33:48.951 --> 33:52.387
Okay. Let's go.

33:52.389 --> 33:54.756
Wait, where are we going?
Trains are that way.

33:54.758 --> 33:56.357
I know.

34:08.370 --> 34:10.204
Donald Carter, huh?

34:12.708 --> 34:16.444
You didn't tell me you did time
in federal prison. Gun trafficking.

34:16.446 --> 34:20.281
DUNCAN: You didn't ask.
And it was a narcotics charge.

34:20.283 --> 34:21.783
Methamphetamines.

34:22.884 --> 34:26.585
Oh yeah?
What cell block were you in?

34:26.588 --> 34:29.489
Look, you don't wanna be a part
of this, that's fine with me.

34:29.491 --> 34:31.757
But I'm done answering questions.

34:33.494 --> 34:36.130
Oh, I didn't give you
permission to leave.

34:41.536 --> 34:43.101
I don't ask permission.

34:44.304 --> 34:46.906
So either you shoot me
or I walk away.

34:52.379 --> 34:54.947
Ah, wait, wait, wait.
Come on.

34:56.217 --> 34:57.217
Okay.

34:59.253 --> 35:00.619
I'm interested.

35:02.789 --> 35:06.325
You got balls, man, I'll give
you that, but it doesn't mean

35:06.327 --> 35:09.328
you're gonna be able to get close enough
to the President to pull this off.

35:09.330 --> 35:13.232
Now, it's all well and good
to know the security plan.

35:13.234 --> 35:15.534
What makes you think
we can get past it?

35:15.536 --> 35:17.769
I was hoping you'd ask
that question.

35:21.241 --> 35:23.708
Secret Service lapel pins.

35:23.710 --> 35:26.044
They change color every day.

35:26.046 --> 35:30.349
Those are the correct ones to get us
past security the day after tomorrow.

35:30.351 --> 35:32.617
Like I've been trying to say,

35:32.619 --> 35:35.854
this is a once in a
lifetime opportunity.

35:41.794 --> 35:45.363
Went in to check on you.
Was close.

35:45.365 --> 35:48.266
I hope you at least considered
shooting the son of a bitch.

35:50.936 --> 35:54.405
You told me to be patient.
It all worked out.

35:54.407 --> 35:56.207
- For us, anyway.
- What do you mean?

35:56.209 --> 35:58.276
Billy doesn't know it yet,
but he and his boys

35:58.278 --> 36:00.077
just signed up
for a suicide mission.

36:01.213 --> 36:03.080
They're the diversion.

36:03.082 --> 36:04.382
(PHONE BEEPING)

36:06.084 --> 36:08.552
DUNCAN: Let's get the hell out of here.
(CAR STARTING)

36:14.859 --> 36:16.927
- Dr. Sanders.
- Madam First Lady.

36:16.929 --> 36:19.029
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

36:19.031 --> 36:20.764
You said you wanted
to speak in private.

36:22.534 --> 36:25.501
I hope it's nothing serious.

36:25.503 --> 36:28.905
As you may recall, I did some blood
work on your husband a few days ago.

36:28.907 --> 36:32.642
- Mmm-hmm.
- And I came upon something unexpected.

36:32.644 --> 36:34.644
Something I wanted
to bring to your attention.

36:34.646 --> 36:35.778
Go on.

36:35.780 --> 36:37.948
Your husband has a genetic marker

36:37.950 --> 36:41.451
which could indicate he is
susceptible to early onset dementia.

36:42.953 --> 36:44.921
Very few people know
about this marker.

36:44.923 --> 36:48.357
It was only identified in a
medical journal last month.

36:48.359 --> 36:53.128
But I think further testing
would be the logical next step.

36:53.130 --> 36:55.832
Have you spoken to Paul about this,
and the White House physician?

36:55.834 --> 36:59.534
No, but I plan to.
I thought I should speak with you first.

36:59.536 --> 37:03.405
Obviously this is a very sensitive
issue in the case of the President.

37:05.608 --> 37:08.377
If people find out he's
being tested for

37:08.379 --> 37:11.046
any form of cognitive impairment,

37:11.048 --> 37:14.683
well, I assume that's the kind of
thing you'd want to keep private.

37:14.685 --> 37:17.151
You were right to come to me.

37:17.153 --> 37:20.355
I appreciate your candor
and your discretion.

37:20.357 --> 37:26.227
As his doctor, I would feel irresponsible
not recommending further testing.

37:26.229 --> 37:28.630
But if we go through
the official channels,

37:28.632 --> 37:32.833
I find it hard to believe
we could keep it secret.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.602
Do you have an alternative proposal?

37:34.604 --> 37:37.538
His upcoming surgery
presents a unique opportunity.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.641
I believe I could take a blood
sample without drawing attention,

37:40.643 --> 37:44.145
but I would need help getting it out
of the hospital into a private lab.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.115
It would require someone
who is capable of

37:48.117 --> 37:50.217
walking through security
without being searched.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.522
Someone like you, Madam First Lady.

38:08.669 --> 38:10.237
Boone?

38:10.239 --> 38:12.506
You see anybody else in here
reading the newspaper?

38:13.607 --> 38:15.675
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

38:19.980 --> 38:23.049
So, uh... How does this work?

38:23.051 --> 38:25.284
It works like this.

38:25.286 --> 38:28.755
Mr. Delaney's paying me a nice chunk
of cash to help you guys disappear,

38:28.757 --> 38:32.425
so if you don't want him to waste
his money, I suggest you listen.

38:32.427 --> 38:34.861
Carefully.

38:34.863 --> 38:39.365
In this envelope you will find new
identities, documents, instructions,

38:39.367 --> 38:41.700
keys to a new house and a new life,

38:41.702 --> 38:46.505
but none of that will be worth a damn
if you don't follow one simple rule.

38:46.507 --> 38:49.075
Leave your past behind.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.878
For how long? I mean, I just
got accepted into college.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.714
You mean Morgan Sanders
got accepted to college.

38:55.716 --> 38:58.116
Morgan Sanders
doesn't exist anymore.

38:59.652 --> 39:02.487
- Don't worry, honey.
- You'll start over.

39:02.489 --> 39:06.491
Listen to your father.
There's only one reason to do this.

39:06.493 --> 39:08.293
Because you don't have a choice.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.155
She called me from a payphone
at DC National Station.

40:12.157 --> 40:13.923
I'll get down there and see
if I can track 'em down.

40:13.925 --> 40:16.392
- Good.
- At least she didn't go to the police.

40:16.394 --> 40:17.893
If she had, they'd be here by now.

40:17.895 --> 40:19.362
She's running.

40:20.864 --> 40:22.565
I'll call a friend at the Bureau.

40:30.774 --> 40:33.676
Hey, Mike, how you doin'?

40:33.678 --> 40:37.813
Good. Good, good.
Listen. I need a favor.

40:37.815 --> 40:42.818
It's kind of embarrassing, but I got
myself into a bit of a mess at home.

40:42.820 --> 40:47.089
My wife and I have been
struggling lately, and, uh...

40:47.091 --> 40:48.923
Well, she took off with my daughter.

40:51.727 --> 40:55.096
As you can imagine, I'd rather
keep this off the record,

40:55.098 --> 40:58.266
but I need a hand
in tracking them down.

40:58.268 --> 41:01.436
MAN: (ON PA)
Cross-Atlantic airlines, flight 733.

41:01.438 --> 41:03.538
Final boarding at gate four.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.776
- Nina Carlisle?
- Yes?

41:05.811 --> 41:08.709
Follow us.
We need to ask you a few questions.

41:16.919 --> 41:18.886
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Carlisle.

41:18.888 --> 41:20.588
My name is Thomas Blair.
