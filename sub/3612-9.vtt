00:02.003 --> 00:03.539
Previously on Lost:

00:03.629 --> 00:06.371
Anything over $10,000
has to be declared.

00:06.465 --> 00:09.673
You... didn't... declare this.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.296
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.340
- I told you, I don't know anything!
- Calm down!

00:14.432 --> 00:16.218
- Why did you follow me?!
- Your wife sent me!

00:16.309 --> 00:19.426
Something you have to do. She said
you have to stop the Man in Black.

00:20.313 --> 00:22.395
You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.314
What's on Hydra island?

00:26.402 --> 00:29.144
The plane. The same plane
that brought your friends back.

00:29.614 --> 00:32.651
So I want you to go over there
and do some recon.

00:32.742 --> 00:34.152
Who are you?

00:34.911 --> 00:36.401
Put your weapon down!

00:36.495 --> 00:38.110
Take me to your leader.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.913
So why don't you tell me what
brought you over to this island?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.662
John Locke sent me.
So here's the deal, Chief.

00:43.753 --> 00:46.711
I'll go back over there
and tell him the coast is clear,

00:46.797 --> 00:48.048
that I didn't find anybody.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.794
Then I'll bring the old man
right to your doorstep.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.092
And what do you want
in exchange, James?

00:53.179 --> 00:55.261
You give us safe passage
off the island.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.354
Want some cocoa ?

01:11.614 --> 01:12.979
Where'd you find cocoa?

01:14.116 --> 01:16.573
/ didn 't. Pretend.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.041
How's the leg?

01:33.010 --> 01:34.216
Still hurts.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.294
You should leave
the bandage off for a while.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.631
- The air'll do it some good.
- I'll try that.

01:39.725 --> 01:40.885
You mind ifl sit down?

01:48.526 --> 01:50.357
I know you and I haven't
had time to talk,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.730
but I was wondering
if James had filled you in

01:52.822 --> 01:56.861
- on what I showed him at the cliffs.
- You mean the cave.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.613
The one with the names on the wall.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.865
Most of the names
have been crossed off now.

02:03.499 --> 02:04.705
There are just a few left.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.457
"Kwon" is one of them.

02:08.379 --> 02:13.043
- Does that mean me or Sun?
- Well, Jin, I'm not sure.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.126
But what it does mean is that
the only way we can leave the island

02:17.221 --> 02:21.305
is if all the names that haven't
been crossed off go together.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.012
But Sun's not here.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.596
You just take care of that leg.
l'm workin' on it.

02:39.618 --> 02:43.486
All right, Mr. Kwon,
here's your suitcase and your watch.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.742
Please proceed
to the U. 8. Customs office.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.123
- Money?
- I'm sorry.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.296
Federal law says we have
to confiscate the $25,000.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.841
- Confiscate?
- It means that if you want it back,

02:57.928 --> 03:00.510
you're gonna have to fill out
the necessary papenNork.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.382
- Money.
- You can exit right over there, sir.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.008
May | help you?

03:41.514 --> 03:44.631
- Paik.
- A reservation for Paik.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.549
Yes. I've got it right here.

03:46.644 --> 03:49.636
We've got a beautiful ocean view room
for you on the eighth floor.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.975
Two room. Two.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.145
No marry.

03:58.531 --> 04:03.150
- Kwon. Jin Soo Kwon.
- I'm sorry. I apologize.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.493
Yes, there is a separate
room reservation for Kwon.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.120
Room 842. Here you go, sir.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.166
Miss Paik, Mr. Kwon,
welcome to Los Angeles.

04:18.217 --> 04:21.584
I'm leaving for a little while.
I got an errand to run.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.260
When will you be back?

04:23.347 --> 04:24.336
Morning.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.721
Keep an eye on the camp
while I'm gone.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.267
I don't feel anything.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.768
Excuse me?

04:37.236 --> 04:39.272
Anger... happiness...

04:40.197 --> 04:41.357
...pain.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.231
I don't feel it anymore.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.951
Maybe that's best, Sayid.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.577
lt'll help you get through
what's comin'.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.312
- What are you doin'?
- I'm getting out of here

05:15.399 --> 05:17.606
- before that thing comes back.
- What thing?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.108
Locke.

05:20.196 --> 05:23.563
And you're just sitting around here,
listening to whatever he tells you.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.070
I ain't listenin' to nobody. I told you
l have a deal with Widmore. If you...

05:27.161 --> 05:29.117
It doesn't matter
who you have a deal with.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.947
I've waited long enough.
I'm going to find my wife.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.908
- Find her where?
- I'll go back to the Temple.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.789
If she's not there, I'll try the beach.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.745
But I will find Sun,
so stop trying to...

06:06.242 --> 06:07.857
Is this the guy?

06:10.829 --> 06:13.206
Yeah. Let's take him.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.514
Play your card, Captain.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.472
Now what?

06:41.318 --> 06:43.809
- We wait.
- Wait... for what?

06:45.114 --> 06:46.274
For Richard to come back.

06:46.365 --> 06:50.153
You'll forgive my skepticism,
but the last thing Richard said

06:50.244 --> 06:53.577
before he went stomping off into the
jungle, was that we were all in hell,

06:53.664 --> 06:56.497
and he had no idea what
we were supposed to do next.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.917
In fact, I would bet money
we never see him again.

07:00.004 --> 07:01.369
Hugo will find him.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.419
He will track him down
and bring him back.

07:03.507 --> 07:07.045
Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease,
I'm not sure Hurley can track anything.

07:07.136 --> 07:11.129
- Hey. Don't talk about bacon.
- Jacob has never lied to me before.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.845
If he said Richard knows what to do,
then Richard knows what to do.

07:14.935 --> 07:19.474
He'll come back.
And until then, we wait.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.616
How are the tomatoes?

07:42.880 --> 07:44.245
Dead.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.336
I remember when you first
planted this here.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.590
It feels like a hundred years ago.

07:53.766 --> 07:56.132
You don't believe
Alpert's coming back, do you?

07:57.645 --> 07:59.351
I don't care if he comes back.

07:59.438 --> 08:03.272
What about us... being candidates?

08:03.359 --> 08:04.940
What about it?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.020
Hurley took me to a lighthouse.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.940
To Jacob's lighthouse.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.118
And... there was a mirror,

08:17.498 --> 08:20.535
and all around it, there were
hundreds of names written down.

08:20.626 --> 08:24.289
I don't care. I don't care about
Alpert or being a candidate.

08:24.380 --> 08:27.713
Sun... There's a reason
we were brought...

08:27.800 --> 08:31.292
I don't wanna hear about
how this is our purpose or destiny!

08:33.639 --> 08:35.971
| just want you to go away
and leave me alone.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.656
Sun.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.657
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.247
Bad day?

11:09.086 --> 11:10.246
What are you doing here?

11:12.506 --> 11:13.791
I found your husband.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.748
What?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.800
I promised you
I would reunite you two.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.970
Took me a little longer
than I thought it would.

11:22.057 --> 11:25.424
But he's with my people back
at my camp across the island.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.058
I can take you to him right now.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.433
I don't believe you.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.944
You killed those people at the Temple.

11:39.741 --> 11:43.325
Those people were confused.
They were lied to.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.744
I didn't want to hurt them.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.288
Any one of them could've
chosen to come with me.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.375
And I'm giving you that choice,
Sun, right now.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.546
I would never make you
do anything against your will.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.466
I'm asking you. Please.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.802
Come with me.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.214
Jin is waiting.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.391
Sun!

12:23.911 --> 12:25.117
Sun, wait!

14:17.566 --> 14:19.602
Ms. Paik. Hi.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.934
l'm Martin Keamy.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.943
I'm a friend of your father's.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.280
Mind ifl come in?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.287
I believe you've got something for me.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.044
Sun?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.339
Sun, can you hear me?

14:45.969 --> 14:47.550
What happened?

14:48.847 --> 14:50.257
You all right?

14:54.352 --> 14:56.138
I'm sorry, what?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.938
Sun, slow down. Tell me
what happened in English.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.018
Who did this to you?

15:06.782 --> 15:07.862
Locke.

15:38.730 --> 15:39.719
Sayid.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.395
Sayid. Hey.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.235
- What happened?
- We were attacked.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.441
By whom?

15:53.870 --> 15:54.985
I don't know.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.867
Where is Jin?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.273
Hey!

16:24.860 --> 16:26.020
Hey!

16:56.266 --> 16:57.927
Well, that was weird.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.018
Where am |?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.270
It's called room 23.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.607
The Dharma Initiative
was doing experiments

17:07.694 --> 17:09.434
on subliminal messaging in here.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.355
But you know all about the Dharma
Initiative, don't you, Mr. Kwon?

17:13.450 --> 17:17.068
- Why did you bring me here?
- Relax. You're safe.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.277
I'm leaving.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.124
Sorry.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.625
But we went to a lot of trouble getting
you here off of the other island.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.794
And I can't let you leave.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.468
What do you want from me?

17:39.976 --> 17:43.059
These are grid maps
that the Dharma people used

17:43.146 --> 17:45.353
to identify pockets
of electromagnetism.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.103
Whoever signed these
could really help me out.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.853
I know the writing's difficult to read,

17:52.948 --> 17:57.317
but it sure looks like
it says, "Jin Soo Kwon."

17:57.911 --> 18:01.074
So... is it you or isn't it?

18:02.207 --> 18:06.576
You want answers to your questions?
Then get me your boss.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.454
I want to talk with Charles Widmore.

18:13.510 --> 18:18.595
Well, then you're in luck, Mr. Kwon,
because he'd like to talk to you, too.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.520
You a good swimmer?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.936
- Good enough.
- Wrap this in plastic.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.639
You don't want it to get wet.
We're taking the outrigger.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.188
Something wrong, Claire?

18:50.130 --> 18:54.373
What you said to Jin,
about the names on the wall,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.879
you told him you needed them all
to get off the island.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.506
Yes, I did.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.338
Was... was my name on the wall?

19:03.226 --> 19:04.727
No.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.393
Well, then it doesn't matter
if I get on that plane, then.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.563
- I mean, you don't need me.
- That's not true, Claire. I need you.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.323
There's plenty of room
on that plane for all of us.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.407
Well, when we go home,
Aaron's not gonna know me.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.955
Stranger to my own son.
He thinks Kate's his mother.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.207
ls her name on the wall?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.173
No, Claire, it isn't, not anymore.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.255
- But I need Kate.
- Why?

19:44.434 --> 19:47.267
Because I'm three people shy
of getting off this island,

19:47.354 --> 19:49.720
and Kate can help me get
these people on that plane.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.891
But once she does...

19:57.989 --> 20:00.901
...then whatever happens, happens.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.038
What's up with the guns?
You two going somewhere?

20:13.088 --> 20:15.454
We're taking a boat ride
over to the other island.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.291
You need a boat? Can't you turn into
smoke and fly your ass over the water?

20:20.178 --> 20:23.090
Do you think ifl could do that,
I would still be on this island?

20:23.181 --> 20:25.297
No, 'cause that'd be ridiculous.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.889
What the hell you going
over there for, anyway?

20:29.979 --> 20:32.356
I thought you were trying
to avoid Charlie Widmore.

20:34.234 --> 20:38.147
They took one of our people, James.
So I'm going to get him back.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.296
This for me?

21:06.349 --> 21:08.135
This is really nice.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.719
Your bodyguard is supposed to give me
some money. Where's Mr. Kwon?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.103
No English.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.527
All right, sit down.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.613
I checked his room.
He's not there.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.880
Check the bathroom.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.017
- Come on. Let's go.
- Mr. Kwon,

21:53.104 --> 21:55.186
why don't you come and join us?

21:59.652 --> 22:03.065
Look, thank you for the watch, OK?

22:03.156 --> 22:07.900
But you're also supposed to give me
an envelope with money in it, $25,000.

22:14.292 --> 22:17.534
Stop that. I feel like I'm
in a damn Godzilla movie.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.545
What's that guy's name? The...

22:21.966 --> 22:25.504
The Russian guy, speaks, like, nine
different languages. Danny's friend.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.881
- Mikhail.
- Mikhail. Can he speak Korean?

22:27.972 --> 22:30.258
- I think so.
- OK, go get him.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.346
Now put your damn clothes on.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.696
She says the money her father
gave them was taken at Customs.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.903
That's not my problem.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.907
She wants you to let them
please go to the bank.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.377
They will get it for you.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.050
You take her to the bank.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.472
I'll take Casanova here
to the restaurant.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.600
And we'll meet there.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.197
What's he whining about?

23:29.284 --> 23:32.651
He wants you to promise that you won't
tell her father that they are involved.

23:34.956 --> 23:40.417
Oh, hey, don't worry about that.
OK? Your secret is safe with me.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.879
OK? Just bring me the money, and we
can all live happily ever after, right?

24:01.065 --> 24:05.434
What? For the fourth time,
I was gathering mangoes,

24:05.528 --> 24:07.610
she was already unconscious
when I found her.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.188
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because you're speaking.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.860
You got a pretty decent-sized bump.
Might be a slight concussion.

24:15.872 --> 24:19.456
You can understand what I'm saying,
but you can only speak Korean.

24:21.669 --> 24:26.538
She hits her head and forgets English?
Are we supposed to buy that?

24:26.633 --> 24:29.090
Asked the man who communes
with the dead.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.050
It might be aphasia.

24:32.013 --> 24:34.925
It's a condition that's caused by trauma

24:35.016 --> 24:38.383
and affects the language center
of your brain. It's usually temporary.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.894
Sun. You're gonna be OK.

24:44.192 --> 24:45.648
What are you smiling about?

24:55.161 --> 24:56.662
Pack your bags. We're leaving.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.590
Don't move!

25:20.019 --> 25:21.350
Let me see your hands!

25:23.064 --> 25:25.976
Easy, friend. I come in peace.

25:47.755 --> 25:48.915
Do you know who I am?

25:50.007 --> 25:53.374
Charles Widmore. Do you know who I am?

25:54.554 --> 25:56.636
Obviously, you're not John Locke.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.430
Everything else I know
is a combination of myth,

25:59.517 --> 26:02.054
ghost stories
and jungle noises in the night.

26:02.145 --> 26:05.558
I think you know more than that,
judging by these pylons.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.859
Why did you come here?

26:09.485 --> 26:11.225
You took one of my people, Jin Kwon.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.896
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:23.124 --> 26:27.083
A wise man once said that
war was coming to this island.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.587
I think itjust got here.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.465
Where exactly are we going, Richard?

26:43.853 --> 26:44.933
- Where's Locke?
- What?

26:45.021 --> 26:47.558
You said he came to recruit you.
Where did he say he'd be?

26:47.648 --> 26:48.728
Hydra island.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.649
Which is where you landed
the plane you flew back here, right?

26:51.736 --> 26:55.103
- That's right.
- This man wants to leave the island,

26:55.198 --> 26:58.065
that plane's the only way he can do it.
You wanna know where we're going?

26:58.159 --> 27:00.741
- We're gonna stop him.
- This is your fault, isn't it?

27:01.204 --> 27:02.364
Sort of.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.662
How are we gonna stop him
from getting on the plane?

27:04.749 --> 27:06.080
We have to destroy it.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.794
Why isn't she speaking English?

27:15.885 --> 27:18.376
She was hit on the head
when she was running away from Locke.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.961
He came back here?

27:20.723 --> 27:23.886
What... what did he want?
What did he say to you?

27:24.477 --> 27:25.717
You... you understand me?

28:00.513 --> 28:02.003
I don't think she wants to come.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.815
Ms. Paik would like to know
if there is a problem.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.441
I'm sorry. I'm showing
that your account was closed.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.284
The balance is zero.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.709
If she may ask,
who closed the account, please?

28:37.800 --> 28:39.711
Looks like... her father.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.384
Mr. Woo-Jung Paik had access.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.302
The funds were transferred

28:44.390 --> 28:47.097
to one of his other accounts
at our main branch in Seoul.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.740
Come on! Get in here.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.747
Come on. Get in.

29:13.336 --> 29:15.918
- What's going on?
- I bumped his head on the door.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.917
Come on, Omar. You gotta be
more careful than that.

29:26.849 --> 29:27.929
I got this.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.891
You go get the Arab guy.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.139
Hey. I'm an Arab.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.686
Just go pick him up.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.358
Sorry about that.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.688
Omar's loyal, but he lacks
attention to detail.

29:45.201 --> 29:48.989
You don't understand a word I'm saying
to you right now, do you? Nothin'?

29:49.080 --> 29:52.163
All right. Just hold still, OK?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.913
I'm gonna strap you in here.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.798
In case you figure out
what's about to happen to you,

29:59.882 --> 30:02.089
I can't have you freaking out.

30:05.721 --> 30:10.135
I don't think you realize
how unhappy Mr. Paik was

30:10.226 --> 30:12.763
when he found out that
you were doing his little girl.

30:15.231 --> 30:19.440
Well, you know that 25 grand
that you were supposed to deliver?

30:20.403 --> 30:23.236
That was my fee for popping you.

30:24.949 --> 30:29.192
From what I hear, anyone who works
for Paik knows the cardinal rule:

30:29.745 --> 30:31.246
hands off the boss' daughter.

30:33.249 --> 30:36.116
But you... you couldn't
resist her, could you?

30:41.549 --> 30:44.291
The heart wants what the heart wants.

30:51.392 --> 30:52.598
Thank you.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.274
I'm sorry.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.320
Some people just aren't
meant to be together.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.912
What the hell were you thinking?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.706
I'm sorry. I know.
I know we panicked.

31:17.793 --> 31:20.705
This was not supposed to happen
for days. We had a timetable.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.297
See, he was leaving their camp.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.918
You should have let him leave
and taken him in the jungle.

31:25.009 --> 31:27.216
Well, maybe you should put
a mercenary in charge

31:27.303 --> 31:29.134
instead of a geophysicist.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.470
What's done is done.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.052
I need you to get the package
from the submarine

31:38.147 --> 31:41.560
and take it to the infirmary.
Can you do that for me, please, Zoe?

31:42.318 --> 31:43.649
Yeah, sure.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.488
Mr. Kwon.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.701
My apologies for everything
that's been done to you.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.654
- My name is...
- I know who you are.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.034
Why did you bring me here?

31:59.335 --> 32:03.169
We searched the Ajira plane, discovered
your wife's luggage and found this.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.585
I thought you might want to have it.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.417
Go ahead. Turn it on.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.942
Her name is Ji Yeon.

32:28.364 --> 32:29.729
Your daughter.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.030
I understand you've never
seen her before.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.175
I have a daughter, too.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.223
I know what it's like to be kept apart.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.306
I understand the one thing you want

33:04.400 --> 33:06.516
is to be reunited
with your wife and daughter.

33:08.195 --> 33:12.108
But it would be short-lived
if that thing,

33:12.199 --> 33:14.815
masquerading as John Locke,
ever got off this island.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.992
Your wife, your daughter,
my daughter,

33:17.079 --> 33:18.740
everyone we know and love...

33:20.374 --> 33:22.080
...would simply cease to be.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.005
I came here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.206
How?

33:32.386 --> 33:33.626
Come with me.

33:34.263 --> 33:36.345
I think it's time
for you to see the package.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.599
- What package?
- It's not a "what."

33:43.939 --> 33:45.440
It's a "who."

33:52.698 --> 33:55.189
Did you put my brother in the hospital?

33:55.284 --> 33:57.650
Such a dangerous world, Sayid,

33:57.745 --> 33:59.827
and you know that
because you're from Iraq.

34:30.945 --> 34:31.980
Who are you?

34:33.697 --> 34:34.857
No English.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.532
I don't know why you're here,
and I don't really care.

34:41.372 --> 34:42.828
No!

34:43.999 --> 34:45.114
Free.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.575
Free!

34:47.670 --> 34:48.876
Free.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.017
Good luck.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.891
Martin.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.649
Martin? Who did this to you?

35:57.781 --> 35:59.612
Look behind you, you idiot.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.490
I brought you a couple things.

37:27.663 --> 37:30.655
I was thinking about a patient
that I had during my residency.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.834
Car crash, banged his head.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.870
When he woke up, he couldn't talk.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.008
The guy was frustrated. I mean...
Who wouldn't be?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.090
One of the nurses said,

37:46.181 --> 37:49.093
"Just because he can't speak
doesn't mean that he can't write."

37:52.146 --> 37:53.511
Think you could give it a try?

38:07.870 --> 38:12.034
It'll take longer to get your point
across, but you'll have your voice back.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.752
I went back to your garden
to see if he was there.

38:20.257 --> 38:21.542
He wasn't but...

38:23.552 --> 38:24.792
...then I found this.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.553
That's one stubborn tomato.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.891
Guess no one told it
it was supposed to die.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.494
Don't worry about it.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.910
You're not the first person
to tell me to leave them alone.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.880
Locke... what did he say to you?

39:16.563 --> 39:18.064
Why didn't you go with him?

39:27.783 --> 39:28.989
Do you trust me?

39:39.336 --> 39:42.544
Sun, come with us,
and I'll help you find Jin.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.969
I'll help you find him,
get you both on that plane

39:48.053 --> 39:49.964
and as far away from this island
as you can get.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.299
I promise.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.160
Where'd you go?

40:21.837 --> 40:23.293
What?

40:24.172 --> 40:26.834
Looked like your brain
took a little stroll.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.885
- Why aren't you worried, James?
- I am worried.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.551
Just really good at pretending I ain't.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.056
But I got a feeling this is almost over.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.767
'Cause if Locke rode over there
on the boat with Sayid,

40:42.858 --> 40:45.565
then Charlie Widmore blew him
right out of the water.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.233
And what if he didn't?

40:47.321 --> 40:50.188
Then we're screwed
six ways from Sun...

40:53.994 --> 40:56.861
- Hell.
- He's alone.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.203
Thought you went over there to find Jin.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.078
They said they didn't have him.

41:06.173 --> 41:08.209
- And you believed that?
- No.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.375
Where's Sayid?
Did you lose him, too?

41:12.346 --> 41:15.088
When you were there,
you mentioned that Widmore had someone

41:15.182 --> 41:17.423
guarding a room on his submarine.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.894
Guarding something that
he didn't want you to see?

41:19.978 --> 41:21.434
Yeah, so?

41:23.023 --> 41:24.604
I don't like secrets.

41:37.371 --> 41:39.578
OK, come on. OK.

41:40.415 --> 41:41.746
Hey, be careful with him.

41:43.752 --> 41:47.210
- All right. OK.
- The guy can hardly stand.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.253
Well, what do you expect?

42:00.352 --> 42:01.592
How much did you give him?

42:02.354 --> 42:05.721
Obviously, I gave him too much, but we
needed him knocked out for the trip.

42:05.816 --> 42:08.603
I'm not a nurse. Come on. Get him up.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.901
Let's go, Mr. Hume.

42:12.948 --> 42:16.031
- Be careful.
- Come on.
