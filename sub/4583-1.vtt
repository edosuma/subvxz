15:44.110 --> 15:45.540
Yes, this is Bob Wiley.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.340
I'm a patient of Dr. Marvin's.

15:47.410 --> 15:48.410
I have to speak with him right away.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.180
It's urgent.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.380
I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley,
but Dr. Marvin's out.

15:52.450 --> 15:53.750
It's Bob.
And you are?

15:53.820 --> 15:55.280
Betty.

15:55.350 --> 15:56.650
Betty, hi.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.290
Bob, Dr. Marvin's out of town

15:58.350 --> 16:00.290
and Dr. harmon's taking his calls.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.020
I know that, Betty.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.160
It's just that there's
been some confusion.

16:06.230 --> 16:08.100
I was supposed to call Dr. Marvin,

16:08.160 --> 16:10.160
but I've lost his phone number.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.570
Bob, I can't give out that number.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.770
I know that, Betty,
but you could

16:15.840 --> 16:17.500
call him on the other line

16:17.570 --> 16:19.670
and tell him that I'm on
hold on the other line.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.610
Couldn't you, please?
Thanks, Betty, please?

16:25.880 --> 16:27.780
Siggy, honey,
put that down in front

16:27.850 --> 16:29.780
of that other chair, okay?

16:29.850 --> 16:33.720
[Phone rings]
- Okay, mom.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.360
Thank you, Anna.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.330
Sure.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.830
Thank you, sweetheart.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.900
- Yes?
- Dr. Marvin?

16:47.970 --> 16:50.500
This is Betty at your exchange.

16:50.570 --> 16:53.140
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I have a Bob Wiley

16:53.210 --> 16:55.480
on the line who says
you'll want to talto him.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.380
Betty, you know better than that.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.680
Dr. harmon is covering for me.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.180
I told him that, doctor,

17:00.250 --> 17:03.780
but he said he lost your
number and that it was urgent.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.450
All right,
put him through.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.520
Go ahead, Bob.

17:07.589 --> 17:08.589
This is Dr. Marvin.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.760
What's the problem, Bob?

17:10.829 --> 17:13.430
Dr. Marvin,
how's the weather up there?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.359
What?

17:15.430 --> 17:16.660
How's your brood?

17:16.730 --> 17:19.300
You all getting a chance to relax?

17:19.369 --> 17:21.800
Bob, I thought I made it clear

17:21.869 --> 17:24.810
to you that I'm on vacation.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.569
Well, I know,
but I'm just worse than usual this time.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.210
Really bad.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.640
Bob, if this is really an emergency,

17:29.710 --> 17:31.780
go to the emergency room.

17:31.850 --> 17:32.780
And if it isn't,
call Dr. harmon.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.450
I'm sure he can help you.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.220
Well, I'd just feel so much better

17:36.280 --> 17:37.790
if I knew where you were.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.250
It's Martha's vineyard, right?

17:39.320 --> 17:40.690
Bob.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.720
Well, can't we just talk?

17:41.790 --> 17:42.890
Yes, we can.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.260
In my office after labor day.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.760
After you're back from fire island, huh?

17:46.830 --> 17:48.930
Good-bye, Bob.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.830
What, you want to keep
Maine all to yourself?

17:50.900 --> 17:54.800
Good-bye, Bob!

17:54.870 --> 17:58.540
Is this a fake hang up?

17:58.610 --> 18:01.180
It's a fake hang up.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.440
- Eat these beans.
- No, no.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.140
[Phone ringing]

18:04.210 --> 18:06.750
I'll get the phone.
I'll get the phone.

18:12.350 --> 18:13.750
Hello?

18:13.820 --> 18:15.190
Doctor, it's Betty again.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.660
I have an urgent call from your sister.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.190
My sister?
Put her through.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.330
Go ahead.

18:26.330 --> 18:30.770
It's not you,
it's me.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.470
Lily, what's wrong?

18:33.540 --> 18:34.780
Dr. Marvin,
please don't be angry.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.740
This is Bob.

18:36.810 --> 18:38.480
I know that I shouldn't
be calling you here--

18:38.550 --> 18:40.980
Bob, the doctor/patient
relationship is based on trust.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.720
When you call me and
pretend to be my sister,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.080
I can't trust you anymore.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.620
Go to the emergency room,
but please

18:45.690 --> 18:49.620
do not call me here again.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.630
Oh, no, no.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.390
That was not smart.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.700
That was not smart.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.770
[Knocking]

19:01.840 --> 19:03.670
Who is it?

19:03.740 --> 19:05.140
Detective Roberts from homicide.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.280
I have some questions
about a Bob Wiley.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.010
What?

19:10.080 --> 19:15.080
That was the Bob who
kept calling Dr. Marvin.

19:15.150 --> 19:19.490
That was that Bob who kept calling.

19:19.550 --> 19:23.220
Unfortunately, Bob committed
suicide about 15 minutes ago.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.330
Oh, my God.

19:25.390 --> 19:26.860
- That's terrible.
- Oh.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.230
Very sad.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.460
Should never have happened.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.330
He was a very sweet guy.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.830
But he did leave a note, however.

19:32.900 --> 19:33.970
He mentioned the name Betty.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.870
- She's Betty.
- I'm Betty.

19:35.940 --> 19:39.910
Oh, so you're Betty.

19:39.970 --> 19:43.010
Uh, Bob calledere trying
to reach his psychiatrist.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.450
Oh, well,
where is he?

19:45.510 --> 19:48.350
I'll have to ask him some questions, too.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.950
Dr. Marvin's on vacation
in New Hampshire.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.050
New Hampshire?

19:53.120 --> 19:55.890
I can get him on the phone for you.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.130
Good.
No, don't.

19:59.190 --> 20:00.790
If I really need to,
I can have somebody

20:00.860 --> 20:03.900
from nhpd drop by,
you know.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.740
Uh, but,
what if I wanted to write him a letter?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.370
Would you have a mailing
address of some kind up there?

20:10.440 --> 20:12.710
Oh, sure.

20:12.770 --> 20:16.410
That's, uh,
p.O. Box 14...

20:16.480 --> 20:17.750
Yes?

20:17.810 --> 20:20.980
Lake winnipesaukee.

20:21.050 --> 20:22.380
Which is spelled--

20:22.450 --> 20:24.750
w-I-n-n-I--

20:24.820 --> 20:28.920
[overlapping dialogue]

20:28.990 --> 20:30.790
That's two ns.
- Two es.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.990
E-e, two ns,
two es.

20:33.060 --> 20:35.130
Thank you very much, ladies.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.630
I'm crazy about you,
especially you, Betty.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.370

20:53.080 --> 20:56.580
Hello.

20:56.650 --> 21:00.550

21:00.620 --> 21:02.090
All right.

21:02.160 --> 21:07.730
Thank you for calling, Betty.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.530
It was the service.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.570
That patient,
the one who called before?

21:12.630 --> 21:13.730
Mm-hmm.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.570
He committed suicide.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.470
Oh, Leo,
how horrible.

21:19.540 --> 21:25.080
Oh, well,
let's not let it spoil our vacation.

21:51.870 --> 21:54.070
Do you think you can do it today, Bob?

21:54.140 --> 21:56.180
We have a baby schedule to keep.

Baby steps get on the bus.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.970
Hello, I'm Bob.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.540
Would you knock me out, please?

22:21.600 --> 22:22.540
Just hit me in the face.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.480
Do we have enough to feed
the entire film crew, dear?

22:35.550 --> 22:37.990
Honey, we have enough to
feed the entire network.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.650
Oh, great.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.520
Another vacation that's not a vacation.

22:41.590 --> 22:44.390
Why do I have to dress
up for this stupid show?

22:44.460 --> 22:45.860
What do you mean?

22:45.930 --> 22:47.130
You've already tried on
everything you own.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.600
I have not!

22:48.660 --> 22:53.730
All right,
all right, gosh.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.940
It's probably gonna be a
short interview, anyway.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.510
You know, just me and the family,
and my book.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.080
Easy, fella,
we're almost there.

I don't know.

24:55.590 --> 24:58.930
What are you doing here?

24:58.990 --> 25:00.760
I thought you were dead.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.600
Oh, no.
They told you.

25:02.660 --> 25:05.330
Well, I fibbed a little bit,
but don't be mad.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.000
Bob, your behavior is
completely inappropriate.

25:09.070 --> 25:10.170
You're angry.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.810
No, no,
I don't get angry.

25:11.870 --> 25:12.870
Well, you're upset.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.340
I don't get upset.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.910
Well, then let's have a little talk.

25:15.980 --> 25:17.410
Bob.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.250
I do not see patients on vacation.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.780
Ever.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.220
How many ways can I make that clear?

25:22.280 --> 25:23.620
Now, what I'd like you to do

25:23.690 --> 25:25.590
is to get on this bus and
go back to New York.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.020
I can't.
I'm totally paralyzed.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.560
I'm all locked up.

25:28.620 --> 25:29.820
You got yourself here.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.330
Barely!

25:31.390 --> 25:33.390
Well, getting back will be therapeutic.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.930
But can't we just have a little talk?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.330
Bob, you are testing my patience.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.870
Come on.
I've come so far.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.000
- Bob!
- I'm baby steppin'.

25:39.070 --> 25:39.970
I'm doing the work.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.200
I'm not a slacker!

- Listen to me.
- Check it out.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.010
Lookit, I'm in really bad shape.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.220
Go to the bus station,
buy yourself a ticket home,

26:00.290 --> 26:02.260
and then wait for me in that coffee shop.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.090
You'll meet me?

26:04.160 --> 26:08.430
I'll call you...
in two hours.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.230
Oh, my God.
You're the greatest.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.700
No, no.
Just you have to promise me

26:12.770 --> 26:14.230
that you will buy your
ticket and go home.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.340
Absolutely.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.840
I'm gonna do it right now.

26:17.910 --> 26:22.110
All right,
I'll call you at 4:00.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.180
You couldn't possibly make it 3:30,
could you?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.210
Bob!

26:25.280 --> 26:26.980
4:00, 4:00, okay.

26:27.050 --> 26:28.350
Exactly, 4:00.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.880
It's better.

26:29.950 --> 26:32.990
Okay, thank you, Dr. m.

26:33.050 --> 26:36.260
Baby step to 4:00.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.930
Baby step to 4:00.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.160
Baby step to 4:00.

26:43.230 --> 26:47.030
Baby step to 4:00.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.000
Baby step to 4:00.

26:50.070 --> 26:54.270
Baby step to 4:00.

26:54.340 --> 26:56.840
Oh, my gosh!
I need a bowl!

26:56.910 --> 26:58.550
- What?
- A bowl.

26:58.610 --> 27:00.180
He's been locked in
for about eight hours.

27:00.250 --> 27:04.350
He's about to scream.
He's furious.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.920
Sorry, Gil.

27:05.990 --> 27:07.790
A little negligence on my part.

27:07.860 --> 27:08.820
Here you go.
Come on.

27:08.890 --> 27:09.920
Hang tight, fella.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.460
Geronimo!

27:12.530 --> 27:13.890
It was a long ride,
wasn't it?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.160
I know you needed to stretch.

27:15.230 --> 27:17.430
Hey, no, no, no!

27:17.500 --> 27:19.370
I'm expecting a phone call.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.570
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.200
Thanks, everybody.
I really appreciate it.

27:24.270 --> 27:28.140
Also, uh,
if I lose consciousness

27:28.210 --> 27:31.750
or black out or something explodes,

27:31.810 --> 27:33.410
would you tell Dr. Marvin when he calls--

27:33.480 --> 27:36.950
- Dr. Leo Marvin?
- Do you know him?

27:37.020 --> 27:40.850
Yeah, he bought our dream house.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.020
Worked a lifetime to save
for a down payment.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.790
And he swooped down
with his bag full of money

27:45.860 --> 27:47.800
and grabbed it out from under us.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.930
Son of a bitch.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.170
She never says that.

27:52.230 --> 27:55.000
Stay as far away from him as possible.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.070
Well, that'll be easy.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.140
He won't see me.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.810
That's why I'm waiting for the phone call.

27:59.870 --> 28:03.180
He won't see you?

28:03.240 --> 28:06.450
Well, we'll show you where he lives.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.950
You will?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.720
The son of a bitch!

28:09.780 --> 28:11.950
She never says that.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.120
Siggy, I have the whole house to fix,
all the art to hang.

28:15.190 --> 28:17.790
I have no idea what I'm
gonna wear on the TV show.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.490
But I have stopped everything in
order to teach you how to dive,

28:20.560 --> 28:22.930
because it is as important
for me to see you dive

28:23.000 --> 28:25.070
<i>as it is for me to appear
on good morning America.</i>

28:25.130 --> 28:26.830
Oh, man,
this is really precious.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.800
Come on,
take off your robe.

28:30.870 --> 28:32.770
Why are you always wearing black?

28:32.840 --> 28:34.580
What is it with you and
this death fixation?

28:34.640 --> 28:38.850
Maybe I'm in mourning
for my lost childhood.

28:38.910 --> 28:41.320
All right, come on.
Come on, turn around.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.550
Toes at the edge.
That's it.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.520
Remember what we learned last year.

28:43.590 --> 28:45.050
Okay, one, two, three, spring.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.390
Now bend at the knees,
bend at the waist,

28:46.450 --> 28:47.720
hands out stiff as a board.

28:47.790 --> 28:51.830
One, two, three, spring.

28:51.890 --> 28:54.900
One, two,

28:54.960 --> 28:58.100
three...

28:58.170 --> 29:00.330
Spring.

29:02.540 --> 29:05.140
Spring... summer, fall.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.840
Time to go, dad.

29:06.910 --> 29:09.510
I don't understand.
Why won't you dive?

29:09.580 --> 29:11.510
With all the horror that's
going on in the world,

29:11.580 --> 29:13.750
what difference does it make?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.250
Hi, Lily.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.920
I'm just calling to remind you

29:20.990 --> 29:23.290
about Leo's surprise party.
Thursday night, 7:00.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.830
Okay?

29:25.890 --> 29:27.530
Well, it'll be after his interview,

29:27.600 --> 29:30.230
so he should be rela--
uh-oh, wait a minute.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.000
Oh, well,
of course I'm thrilled, Lily.

29:37.070 --> 29:39.970
The last person they interviewed
on vacation was Dr. Ruth.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.810
Uh-huh.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.210
Here he comes.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.410
Thursday night, 7:00.
Don't forget.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.450
Okay, bye-bye.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.020
He didn't dive?

29:55.090 --> 29:56.360
No.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.060
Now come on, sweetheart.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.190
He's just a little afraid of it.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.830
Have patience.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.460
It's not like I'm making him jump

30:02.530 --> 30:04.430
out of an airplane or anything.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.770
When I was growing up,
I thought diving was fun.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.670
I thought you were born grown-up, daddy.

30:14.310 --> 30:17.480
Yes, I'd like the number
to the guttmans' coffee--

30:23.790 --> 30:25.790
what are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

30:25.850 --> 30:27.520
Don't be mad.
The guttmans brought me.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.120
Thank you,
Mr. and Mrs. g.

30:29.190 --> 30:31.260
You're welcome, Bobby.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.290
Hello, Dr. Marvin.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.000
The house looks good.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.960
Burn in hell,
Dr. Marvin!

30:37.030 --> 30:39.200
[Engine turns]

30:42.500 --> 30:44.540
Bob, we agreed that I would call you.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.640
Your coming here is
unbelievably inappropriate.

30:47.710 --> 30:50.480
Dad, can I,
um-- oh, sorry.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.650
Hi, you're Anna,
aren't you?

30:52.710 --> 30:55.280
I saw your picture.
I'm Bob.

30:55.350 --> 30:57.450
Hi, Bob.
Nice to meet you, Bob.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.150
Hi, I'm Bob!

31:00.220 --> 31:01.460
I'm Fay.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.020
Oh, Mrs. m,
you are even prettier

31:04.090 --> 31:05.090
than your picture.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.390
[Chuckles]

31:06.460 --> 31:08.030
And younger.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.630
[Giggles] Thank you.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.700
Fay, Anna,
would you please excuse us?

31:12.770 --> 31:15.400
I think Bob and I have
something to talk about.

31:15.470 --> 31:18.270
Really?
You think so too?

31:18.340 --> 31:20.470
Let's take a walk.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.540
Bob, could I take your fish?

31:22.610 --> 31:24.350
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

31:24.410 --> 31:25.750
He's already eaten.

31:25.810 --> 31:29.320
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.690
This is a great place.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.450
No wonder the guttmans wanted it.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.320
Whoa!

31:36.390 --> 31:38.230
I'm sorry about barging in here like this.

31:38.290 --> 31:40.660
That's all right.
I understand.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.500
Problems don't go
away just because I do.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.230
[Giggling]

31:44.300 --> 31:46.530
Bob, I'd like you to...

31:46.600 --> 31:49.840
Take a long look around you.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.770
What does everything you
see here have in common?

32:01.220 --> 32:03.350
Vacation, Bob.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.390
Vacation.

32:05.450 --> 32:08.490
Now I can't, Bob,
at this time give you

32:08.560 --> 32:10.220
the kind of therapeutic
attention you need

32:10.290 --> 32:14.090
to solve all your problems
and you know why.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.930
- You're on vacation.
- Exactly.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.500
What I can do is this.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.940
Aww, don't give me pills.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.270
I already have pills.

32:23.340 --> 32:27.640
Uh-uh-uh, this is not pills.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.180
Read it.

32:30.250 --> 32:34.450
It says,
"take a vacation...

32:34.520 --> 32:36.650
From my problems."

32:36.720 --> 32:39.350
I'm giving you permission
to take a vacation, Bob.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.060
Not a vacation from your work

32:41.120 --> 32:42.560
and not a vacation from your daily life,

32:42.620 --> 32:44.490
but a vacation...

32:44.560 --> 32:46.190
From my problems.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.830
Exactly!

32:47.900 --> 32:50.530
Now, I want you to get on that
bus and go back to New York.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.200
But every single time a problem arises,

32:54.270 --> 32:55.700
I want you to take that prescription out

32:55.770 --> 32:57.370
and follow it to the letter.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.270
Doctor's orders.

32:59.340 --> 33:05.280
I'll see you in New York in
my office in one month.

33:05.350 --> 33:08.320
This is incredible.
This is astounding.

33:08.380 --> 33:11.820
For the first time since eselin I feel free.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.220
You've given me a great gift, doctor.

33:14.290 --> 33:17.460
The gift of life.

33:17.530 --> 33:20.330
You're a great man.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.400
I knew coming up here
was the right thing to do.

33:26.470 --> 33:29.400
It feels right because you're here...

33:29.470 --> 33:33.710
And it feels right because you're leaving.

33:33.780 --> 33:36.010
Have a great vacation.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.350
You too, Bob.

33:39.410 --> 33:43.120
A vacation from my problems!

33:43.180 --> 33:47.350
You bet I will!

33:47.420 --> 33:48.790
There you go.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.890
Baby steps.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.170
[Whistling]

34:00.240 --> 34:02.770
[Indistinct chatter]

34:02.840 --> 34:04.370
Is everything all right, honey?

34:04.440 --> 34:05.840
Yes, everything is perfectly fine.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.170
He seemed pleasant enough.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.380
Mm-hmm, when he's controlled.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.650
[Chuckles]

34:12.710 --> 34:15.420
I got so excited I forgot
to bring you with me.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.380
Gil.

34:17.449 --> 34:20.719
Oh, the fish!

34:25.630 --> 34:27.429
Oh, that's a very nice likeness of you.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.600
- Thank you very much.
- Of everyone, actually.

34:29.659 --> 34:32.429
- Bye, Bob.
- Bye-bye, Bob.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.300
Bye-bye.
So long.

34:35.370 --> 34:36.639
You've got to be Sigmund.

34:36.710 --> 34:37.870
Yes, this is Sigmund and this is Bob.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.310
And Bob was just leaving.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.639
Hi.

34:40.710 --> 34:43.580
Oh, this is Gil,
my fish, Sigmund.

34:43.650 --> 34:44.679
Did you get him out of the lake?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.610
No, he's a city fish.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.520
Cool.

34:48.580 --> 34:49.719
But he's loving it up here.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.820
[Chuckles]

34:51.889 --> 34:54.989
Your father is the most
incredible psychiatrist.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.489
I certainly hope you appreciate him.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.660
Have a great vacation, family.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.500
[Quietly] Me too.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.960
Good-bye, Bob.

35:04.030 --> 35:05.300
- Bye, Bob.
- Nice to meet you.

35:05.370 --> 35:06.200
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.270
Bye.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.470
Well, he's different.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.540
Uh-huh.

35:10.610 --> 35:12.270
Neat fish.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.140
I think I do look younger
than that picture.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.990
Or...

35:37.970 --> 35:39.600
[Grunts]

35:39.670 --> 35:43.770
[Humming]

35:43.840 --> 35:44.910
[Chuckles]

35:44.970 --> 35:47.410
This?

35:47.480 --> 35:48.880
I told you I like the rifle.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.880
I think it's a symbol of virility.

35:50.950 --> 35:52.510
Now can I eat breakfast?

35:52.580 --> 35:54.280
I'm supposed to go sailing
on George stark's boat.

35:54.350 --> 35:56.850
Wait, wait, wait.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.690
Fay, I need your opinion.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.090
Rifle or bust?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.590
I think both look so wonderful, sweetie.

36:03.660 --> 36:07.060
Oh, Fay.

36:07.130 --> 36:09.530
You know I can't live
with that kind of answer.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.570
I need-- I need feedback.

36:11.630 --> 36:15.600
[Bell ringing]

36:21.280 --> 36:23.740
Good morning,
Dr. Marvin.

36:23.810 --> 36:25.880
No, these aren't for you.

36:25.950 --> 36:28.620
They're for Fay...
for yesterday

36:28.680 --> 36:30.220
for your hospitality to Gil and me.

36:30.290 --> 36:32.220
I didn't say thank you.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.650
I thought about what you said.

36:33.720 --> 36:37.460
Take a vacation from
my problems and I did.

36:37.530 --> 36:39.930
- But you're back.
- No, I'm not.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.600
- You're not?
- No, I'm not.

36:42.660 --> 36:45.030
I'm on vacation.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.200
This isn't an appointment.
I'm dropping by.

36:48.270 --> 36:50.300
This is my first time over the lake.

36:50.370 --> 36:53.940
This is my first time anywhere.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.840
I'm a little anxious 'cause
I haven't figured out

36:55.910 --> 36:58.110
how to get food yet,
but I'm staying at the guttmans'.

36:58.180 --> 36:59.780
When I told them what you said,
they insisted.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.320
No, no, no, no, no!

37:01.380 --> 37:03.680
So, I know we can't work,

37:03.750 --> 37:05.520
but let's get the friendship thing going.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.320
See you later.

37:07.390 --> 37:09.420
Sure seems like he's staying,
doesn't it?

37:09.490 --> 37:13.490
Hey, paper boy,
this was on your porch.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.430
Thank you.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.540
Family conference!
Family conference!

37:27.610 --> 37:29.310
All right.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.110
Now, I don't want any of you

37:31.180 --> 37:32.950
letting Bob into this house.

37:33.010 --> 37:35.080
- Why?
- Why?

37:35.150 --> 37:37.650
Sweetheart, aren't you
overreacting just a little bit?

37:37.720 --> 37:39.320
Good, I'm glad we're all in agreement.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.360
Family conference is over.

37:42.420 --> 37:45.930
[Chuckling]

37:45.990 --> 37:48.930
Vacation from my problems.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.860
There's nobody here.

37:50.930 --> 37:52.800
There's nothing to fear.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.740
There's nobody here.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.770
I'm completely alone.

37:56.840 --> 38:01.740
I'm all by myself.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.440
There's nobody here!

38:03.510 --> 38:07.080
Oh!

38:07.150 --> 38:11.220
There's nobody here!

38:22.830 --> 38:24.700
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.430
- Where ya going?
- Just going to town.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.900
Buy some kleenex.

38:28.970 --> 38:30.700
Well, you want a ride?

38:30.770 --> 38:33.640
I'd love one.

38:37.610 --> 38:40.080
Do a lot of people use this car?

38:40.150 --> 38:42.580
Just us.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.630
So what's it like being the
daughter of a brilliant analyst

38:58.700 --> 38:59.900
who's sleeping in the next bedroom

38:59.970 --> 39:01.000
at night when you need him?

39:01.070 --> 39:05.170
Is it great?

39:05.240 --> 39:09.080
No, it's not great.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.780
I have problems the
same as anyone else.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.610
The same as you.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.650
You're afraid your bladder will explode?

39:15.720 --> 39:16.980
What other ones are the same?

39:17.050 --> 39:18.990
Like what?
Like what?

39:19.050 --> 39:21.220
Well, like analyzing everything tdeath

39:21.290 --> 39:23.490
to see if what I'm feeling is normal.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.860
Yes, I have that.

39:25.930 --> 39:28.900
Do you freeze up and turn
into wood when you're around

39:28.960 --> 39:30.630
a good-looking guy and
you don't even know

39:30.700 --> 39:32.170
if he likes you or not?

39:32.230 --> 39:33.900
Well, not a guy, but, yes,
I freeze--

39:33.970 --> 39:35.400
you know what I do?

39:35.470 --> 39:37.670
I treat people as if they were telephones.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.840
If I meet somebody who I don't
think likes me, I say to myself,

39:39.910 --> 39:43.210
"Bob, this one is just
temporarily out of order.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.140
"You know,
don't break the connection.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.880
Just hang up and try again."

39:46.950 --> 39:49.680
- And does it work?
- It seems to be.

39:49.750 --> 39:54.320
I'm on vacation at lake winnipesaukee,
aren't I?

39:54.390 --> 39:56.590
Do you want to come sailing with me

39:56.660 --> 39:57.760
on my friend George's boat?

39:57.830 --> 39:59.930
No, no.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.260
That's okay.
You don't have to.

40:02.330 --> 40:04.870
No, I'd love to.
[Chuckles]

40:04.930 --> 40:06.170
It sounds great.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.540
I've never been on a boat

40:08.600 --> 40:10.940
and I don't think I could handle it.

40:11.010 --> 40:13.870
It just makes my lips
numb to think about it.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.610
But if your friend is a good sailor

40:15.680 --> 40:18.850
and the craft is seaworthy, yes,
I will go sailing.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.680
Yeah, let's go sailing.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.820
I have no other plans.

40:23.890 --> 40:26.250
I'm sailing!

40:26.320 --> 40:29.790
I'm sailing!

40:29.860 --> 40:33.830
I'm sailing!

40:33.900 --> 40:37.230
I'm sailing!

40:37.300 --> 40:39.270
I'm sailing!
I'm sailing!

40:39.330 --> 40:44.670
I'm sailing!

40:44.740 --> 40:47.010
This is child abuse.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.910
If you drop me,
I'll prosecute.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.150
I'm not gonna let go
until you're ready, okay?

40:52.210 --> 40:53.880
Trust me.

40:53.950 --> 40:57.990
Put your hands out like I showed you.

40:58.050 --> 40:59.220
I'm not ready.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.790
You hear me?
I'm not ready.

41:00.860 --> 41:02.690
Don't drop me.
I'm not ready.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.660
Dr. Marvin,
I'm sailing!

41:05.730 --> 41:07.800
Whoa!

41:07.860 --> 41:10.000
- How about that, doc?
- Oh, Siggy.

41:10.070 --> 41:11.870
Oh, oh!

41:11.930 --> 41:14.970
Murderer!

41:15.040 --> 41:17.000
Hitler!

41:17.070 --> 41:19.310
Hi, dad!

41:19.370 --> 41:22.410
I sail!

41:31.290 --> 41:33.220
Anna!

41:33.290 --> 41:34.720
Anna, come here, please.

41:34.790 --> 41:36.520
Dad?

41:36.590 --> 41:38.260
Anna, I'd like to speak to you, please.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.960
Dr. Marvin, Dr. Marvin,
guess what.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.400
Ahoy!

41:41.460 --> 41:44.300
I sail.
I'm a sailor. I sail.

41:44.370 --> 41:45.930
I'd like to talk to my daughter alone.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.230
But isn't this a breakthrough?

41:47.300 --> 41:49.340
I mean,
that I'm a sailor.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.910
I sail.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.170
I sail now.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.110
Keep sailing, Bob.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.680
Out on a boat on the lake

41:56.750 --> 41:58.450
way far away from the dock

41:58.510 --> 42:01.220
into the wind with the
sky and everything.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.980
Ahoy!

42:03.050 --> 42:05.790
I thought I told you to
stay away from Bob Wiley.

42:05.850 --> 42:07.960
Daddy, I was with my friends.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.890
Where are we going?
- Home.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.790
- Well, what about the car?
- Leave it.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.060
It's been a long time since

42:13.130 --> 42:15.760
I've had a talk with my daughter.

42:15.830 --> 42:17.800
Oh, daddy,
not here.

42:17.870 --> 42:22.040
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.770
[Sighs]

42:23.840 --> 42:26.340
Anna, I know you won't
listen to your father,

42:26.410 --> 42:28.280
but you always listen to me.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.240
So I'm asking you not to see Bob Wiley.

42:30.310 --> 42:31.710
Daddy, I am just--

42:31.780 --> 42:32.810
I can't hear you.

42:32.880 --> 42:33.810
Where are you, Anna?

42:33.880 --> 42:37.480
Ooh!

42:37.550 --> 42:40.090
I am just having fun with my friends.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.860
- And Bob Wiley.
- Yes, and Bob Wiley.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.530
Bob Wiley is your father's patient.

42:44.590 --> 42:46.760
Bob Wiley is a very sensitive person.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.160
Your father's sensitive.

42:48.230 --> 42:49.500
Bob listens to people.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.170
Your father listens to people!

42:51.230 --> 42:53.270
Except when he's up here
in lake winnipesaukee.

42:53.340 --> 42:54.940
[Sighs]

42:55.000 --> 42:57.270
He is fun!

42:57.340 --> 42:58.970
Ugh!

42:59.040 --> 43:02.340
Your father's...
kind of fun.

43:05.150 --> 43:08.680
I'm Fay Marvin,
Dr. Marvin's wife...

43:08.750 --> 43:11.820
And I'm very happy to
be on your program.

43:11.890 --> 43:14.760
And these are our children,
Anna and Siggy.

43:32.340 --> 43:34.740
- I'm a failure.
- What?

43:34.810 --> 43:36.280
I'm going on national television tomorrow

43:36.340 --> 43:38.380
as an expert in human behavior

43:38.450 --> 43:39.980
and in the space of the last hour,

43:40.050 --> 43:45.120
both of my children have
told me that they hate me.

43:45.190 --> 43:47.760
Come on,
you know they don't mean it.

43:47.820 --> 43:52.490
Anna accused me of being insensitive.

43:52.560 --> 43:56.460
No.
No.

43:56.530 --> 43:58.900
What she actually said was

43:58.970 --> 44:01.840
I was insensitive and I didn't listen

44:01.900 --> 44:05.070
and I wasn't any fun

44:05.140 --> 44:07.910
and that Bob Wiley was.

44:07.980 --> 44:11.180
♪ give me some time ♪

44:11.250 --> 44:14.580
♪ to blow the man down ♪

44:24.390 --> 44:27.430
notice anything different about me?

44:27.500 --> 44:30.100
- No.
- Do you sail?

44:30.170 --> 44:31.470
No.

44:31.530 --> 44:32.800
Well, I just picked it up.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.170
[Chuckles]

44:34.240 --> 44:36.800
Wonder what I'm going to pick up next.

44:36.870 --> 44:40.270
- Try diving.
- All right, diving.

44:40.340 --> 44:43.010
I know a great teacher.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.110
[Sighs] I mean,
my dad,

44:45.180 --> 44:48.450
he just dropped me in the
water without warning me first.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.650
I mean,
I nearly drowned.

44:50.720 --> 44:53.050
My whole life flashed before my eyes.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.490
Well, you're lucky you're only 12.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.590
It was still grim.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.360
What is it with him and diving?

44:58.430 --> 45:00.330
What's the big deal?

45:00.400 --> 45:03.200
Well, he,
he prob--whoa.

45:06.470 --> 45:08.070
He probably just wants you to beat it.

45:08.140 --> 45:09.570
That's all.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.070
You know,
he probably just wants you to dive

45:11.140 --> 45:13.370
because you're afraid of diving.

45:13.440 --> 45:18.650
Did I tell you I sailed on my first try?

45:18.710 --> 45:19.880
I just let the boat do the work.

45:19.950 --> 45:23.180
That was my secret.

45:23.250 --> 45:25.890
But with diving,
what is the, uh--

45:25.950 --> 45:27.650
what's the thing?
What's the trick?

45:27.720 --> 45:30.560
I don't know.
It's supposed to be easy.

45:30.630 --> 45:36.130
Well, can you give me a handle on it?

45:36.200 --> 45:38.270
Thanks.

45:38.330 --> 45:41.000
Careful.
Oh, careful!

45:41.070 --> 45:42.200
Let's go to the edge.

45:42.270 --> 45:44.640
- Careful.
- Go to the edge.

45:44.710 --> 45:47.410
Come on, toes up,
toes up, to the edge.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.180
Don't worry.
Come on.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.680
Right here.

45:49.740 --> 45:50.940
Let's call this the edge right here.

45:51.010 --> 45:53.480
Okay, then step up to the edge.

45:53.550 --> 45:55.120
Well, then walk up to our edge.

45:55.180 --> 45:58.220
Okay, got you.

45:58.290 --> 46:00.420
Now bend your knees.
Bend your knees.

46:00.490 --> 46:03.490
Very good.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.630
Bend your knees and be stiff as a board.

46:06.700 --> 46:08.600
I am stiff as a board.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.530
Now, lean forward.
Lean.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.300
All right, just a second.
Don't rush it.

46:12.370 --> 46:13.370
Just a second.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.500
This is my first dive.

46:16.570 --> 46:18.770
Okay, lean.
Lean.

46:18.840 --> 46:21.210
Wait, I can't see what you're doing.

46:21.280 --> 46:25.210
Why don't you get in front?

46:25.280 --> 46:26.950
All right, careful.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

46:27.020 --> 46:28.280
Wait, wait.
- Okay, come on, come on.

46:28.350 --> 46:30.150
Now hold my shirt.

46:30.220 --> 46:31.620
I'll show you what we're supposed to do.

46:31.690 --> 46:33.250
I got it.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.790
- Okay.
- All right.

46:34.860 --> 46:37.190
- And bend my knees.
- Bend your knees.

46:37.260 --> 46:38.590
Lean forward.

- Come here.
- All right, I got ya.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.740
I got ya.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.380
I don't want to have to see this.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.340
No, please.
- One.

46:56.410 --> 46:57.610
- No.
- Two.

Don't do it, please!

- Yeah!

You dove.
That's wonderful.

Did you see me dive, dad?

47:22.540 --> 47:24.070
Did you see me dive?
I dove!

47:24.140 --> 47:25.340
Thank you.
Excellent.

47:25.410 --> 47:26.370
Watch this!
I can do it again.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.640
I'll take it from here.

47:27.710 --> 47:28.940
Did you see, dad?

47:29.010 --> 47:30.110
Here, I'm gonna do it again.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.210
Thank you very much.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.580
and Dr. Marvin
accidentally pushed me in.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.350
You have a very nice family.

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:12.950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.380
Thank u for coming.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:19.720
Thank you for coming.

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:22.319
Marie, you're wise.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.130
What do I say to someone who
has turned my whole life around?

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:26.760
Who has given up so much of their time

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.200
and their vacation to make me better?

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.660
What I'd really like to do is put

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:32.270
the greatness of this man in perspective.

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.640
I think there's really only three names.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.410
Dr. Albert schweitzer,
mother Teresa of Calcutta,

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:42.810
probably, and Leo Marvin.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.810
<i>The book is baby steps.</i>

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.180
The author is Dr. Leo Marvin.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.720
And we've been talking with Bob Wiley.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:52.420
Pretty impressive stuff, Bob,
Dr. Marvin.

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:53.649
Back to you, Joan.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.220
Way to go, Bobby!

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:59.960
[Laughing and cheering]

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.260
That was wonderful, Bob.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.860
Thank you very much, Marie.

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:03.860
Can we come back in a few months

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:06.100
and update your progress?

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:08.900
Uh...As long as it's okay with my doctor.

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:12.410
What?
Oh, absolutely.

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.410
That's a very good idea.
- Okay, great.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.040
Come on, dad,
we're taking a picture.

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:17.780
- Come on, dad.
- Come on, Dr. Marvin.

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:18.910
Nah.
Nah.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.550
No.
No, you go ahead.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.080
All right.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:24.720
How long were you planning
on staying up here?

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:25.920
Just till labor day and then we all

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:27.390
go on back to New York City.

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.290
Okay, big smiles, everybody.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.960
All right,
what's the magic word?

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.990
All: Cheese!

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.630
[Laughter]

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.930
Okay, bye-bye.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.900
- Good-bye, Marie.
- Bye-bye.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.370
- Gonna miss you.
- Bye.

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.300
Bye-bye.
It was nice having you.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.840
Bye, Howie.
Bye, Marie.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.740
- Come again.
- Bye.

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:48.110
- They're so nice.
- You were great, Bob.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.080
- You really were.
- You were incredible.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.010
I mean, dad choked,
you saved him.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.950
[Laughter]

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.350
It's such a big day for the whole family.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.890
And here's the one who made it happen.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.360
Dr. Leo Marvin.
Dr. Leo Marvin.

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:07.730
Get out.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.930
No, we won't get out.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.700
We won't.
You deserve it.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:16.540
I mean get out!

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.840
Get out!

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.470
Is it something I said?

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.970
You've ruined my life!

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.340
You've ruined my career.

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.280
You've ruined my book.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.710
You've turned a perfectly peaceful house

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.780
into an insane asylum.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.120
Get out!
- Daddy!

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.350
My God, Leo.
What's gotten into you?

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.820
It was a disaster, Fay!

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.390
No, it wasn't.
You were wonderful, sweetie.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.360
- You were fine, dad.
- Yeah.

01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:40.830
Why did you need to kick
Bob out of the house?

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.660
You think he's gone?
He's not gone.

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:44.970
That's the whole point.

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:46.470
He's never gone!

01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:48.500
Is this some radical new therapy?

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:52.470
You see?

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.780
We can't be expected to understand him.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.380
He's so far above us,

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.780
we're like ropes on the goodyear blimp.

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:07.590
Are you all right?

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.060
I want to apologize to you
for that terrible outburst.

01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:12.230
I'm truly sorry.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:15.400
Call it a case of show-business nerves.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.030
Well, we can all certainly
understand that.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.770
A lot of people freeze on TV, dad.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.540
Thank you.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.070
Bob, how would you
feel about you and me

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.270
having a little talk?

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.080
- Just me and you?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:32.480
I think I'd like to spend
a little time with you.

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:35.480
Pay you back for all the
time you spent with me.

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:36.750
What do you say?

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.450
Feel like going for a little ride?

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.920
Do I?

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:44.960
This is so sweet.

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.830
It's really great of you, dad.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:48.160
It's really nice.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:53.700
Look how happy he is.

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:56.700
[Chuckles]

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:07.480
Try to be home by 7:00.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:20.430
Where are we going?

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.660
Intensive psychotherapy.

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.470
Whoa!

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:25.870
Okay.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:29.140
Some free associations from my infancy.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.440
A beach ball,
a dog, a frog,

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:39.780
a log, a poodle,
a noodle, a doodle.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.820
Dr. Marvin to see Dr. tomsky.

01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:50.860
Dr. Leo Marvin.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:54.090
Main building, doctor.
They're expecting you.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.630
Hey, you're Bob Wiley,
aren't you?

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.060
Yeah.

01:13:57.130 --> 01:13:59.670
I saw you on TV.
You were great.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:02.400
Ha!

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.750
Hello, Leo.
Long time no see.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.820
Sorry I missed your show this morning.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.290
Well, is this the friend you called about?

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.520
Bob Wiley,
I'd like you to meet

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.830
your new pal,
Dr. tomsky.

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:26.430
Hello, Bob.

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:28.560
New pal?
What's wrong with my old pal?

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:32.600
Would you show Mr. Wiley
to his room, please?

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:34.070
Oh, no,
wait a second.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.300
Doctor you're coming with,
aren't you?

01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:38.840
Fellas, I have convulsions.
My bladder is feeling funny.

01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:41.710
Fellas!

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.380
Really appreciate you helping
me out on this, Catherine.

01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.080
I can only hold him for 24 hours, Leo,

01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:47.820
without staff corroboration.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.450
[Chuckles]

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.620
I'm not worried about that in the least.

01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:55.120
I'm sure your entire staff will corroborate.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.920
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Catherine.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.990
You're welcome.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.990
Thank you.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.530
[Continues chuckling]

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:17.340
You see, Bob,
I will not be defeated.

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:19.250
I will negotiate and I will compromise.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.150
But defeat?
Ha, ha, ha.

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.850
Uh-uh.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.950
Cigarette, Bob?

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.990
Oh, sorry.
Didn't realize you were in a straitjacket.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.830
[Laughs maniacally]

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:56.320
[Scatting]

01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:01.760
Honey, Catherine tomsky's on the phone.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.390
Hello?

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:09.200
What?
No! No!

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:10.930
Son of a bitch!
- Where's Bob?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.130
Son of a bitch!

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.340
Honey, where's Bob?

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:23.180
What about Bob?
What about Bob?

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.110
[Yelling] What about Bob?

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.210
"Is it male or female?"

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.050
"It's a female.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.650
What do you think,
I'm weird or something?"

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.620
[Laughter]

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.060
But it reminds me of my favorite poem,

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.430
which is, roses are red,
violets are blue,

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.900
I'm a schizophrenic and so am I.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.100
[Laughter]

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.970
[Tires screeching]

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.250
So the psychiatrist has a patient.

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.780
He draws a circle and says,

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:01.980
"what do you think of
when you see this?"

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.120
He says, "sex." [Laughter]

01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:06.020
That's not the joke yet.
Wait a second.

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:07.490
He draws a picture of a tree and he said,

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.790
"what do you think of that one?"

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.520
"Sex."
"All right."

01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:11.360
And then he draws a picture of a car,
a house.

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:13.130
"Sex, sex, sex."

01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:14.860
The doctor says,
"you're obsessed with sex."

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.160
And the patient says, "well,
you're the one

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:18.100
drawing all the dirty pictures."

01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:20.470
I'm giving you back your
admitting form, Leo,

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.040
to save you any embarrassment.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.140
- Embarrassment?
- Yeah.

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:27.210
Catherine, you have been duped

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.080
by a textbook narcissist.

01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.480
A brilliant sociopath.

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:34.010
Brilliant enough to dupe my entire staff?

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.820
I doubt that.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.950
It's perfectly natural for a patient

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.050
to bond with his analyst.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.920
Oh, it's not--

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.660
if you want to be rid of him,
just tell him

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.060
you won't treat him anymore.

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:45.730
Catherine, that's easy for you to say!

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:47.930
The man is human krazy glue.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.600
You should have never let him
sleep in your pajamas, Leo.

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:53.200
Oh, I can't believe that I'm hearing this!

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:55.940
- Relax, Leo.
- I'm relaxed!

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.040
Take a vacation.

01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:59.810
I'm on vacation!

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:02.110
Maybe you should check
in here for a few days.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.980
Get a handle on things.

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:10.620
[Laughter]

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:12.950
It was an interesting morning, fruitful.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.320
But it lacked the intensity that
you and I generate together.

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:19.060
The sparks that we get one-on-one.

01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:22.400
We just gotta figure out a way
to work around your schedule.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.830
Could we work afternoons?

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.230
2:00 to 4:00?
3:00 to 5:00?

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.340
