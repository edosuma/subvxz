WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.501
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.535 --> 00:02.902
First of all nothing flowed.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.670
That looked painful, not amazing.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.340
I want you to watch Olivia very closely,
Georgie,

00:07.374 --> 00:08.908
you could learn something.

00:08.942 --> 00:12.478
These investors want to
open up a Maggie's in Brooklyn.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.114
- You should do it.
- How long would you be gone?

00:15.149 --> 00:17.350
Not long, just maybe a few days.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.785
A week, a month, a year,

00:18.819 --> 00:20.386
it doesn't matter how long it takes.
Just go.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.622
Oh my god, Adam,
she's having her babies!

00:22.656 --> 00:24.757
- We gotcha. Good boy!
- Come on, yeah!

00:24.792 --> 00:26.592
Good boys!

00:28.028 --> 00:29.762
Good girl, Minnie.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.798
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.267
There's our baby.

00:37.638 --> 00:42.056
Jocelyn, Jolene...
Jonquil?

00:42.242 --> 00:43.743
Really?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.678
Yeah, maybe not Jonquil.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.414
Julie's nice. Yeah, I like Julie.

00:48.449 --> 00:53.719
Ty, we don't even know if it's
gonna be a boy or a girl yet.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.121
It's good to have a
few names picked out,

00:55.155 --> 00:56.522
you know, keep them in mind.

00:57.958 --> 01:01.215
- Yeah...
- What about, uh, Justine?

01:01.528 --> 01:03.262
Uh...

01:05.132 --> 01:06.499
Hi, grandpa.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.934
Yeah, Amy, listen.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.302
These foal, they're tryin' to nurse,

01:09.336 --> 01:10.803
but I don't think they're gettin'
much milk

01:10.838 --> 01:12.205
out of their mom.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.573
Are they okay?

01:13.607 --> 01:17.443
Well, for now,
but they're gonna need milk soon.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.878
Uh, how's Minnie doing?

01:18.912 --> 01:23.017
Not so good.
Could be colic, I'm not sure.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.485
You guys better get
back here if you can.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.955
Oh no.
Okay, we'll be right there.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.356
Come on, Remy!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.437 --> 01:45.905
My dad's waiting outside.
You want a ride?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.707
Uh, no that's okay.
Tim's gonna come get me.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.743
Besides,
I should probably finish this essay.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.279
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.215
Call me later if you need
a little inspiration...

01:56.250 --> 01:57.583
or just a distraction.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.985
Sure.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.863
- Hey Georgie!
- Hi, Sam!

02:10.898 --> 02:13.299
- Oh, can I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.768
Thanks. Whatcha workin' on?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.270
Uh, just an essay for school.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.839
We're supposed to write about
our most memorable moment.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.274
Mr. Hill's class, right?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.675
Yeah.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.143
I had the same assignment
in junior high.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.412
I don't even remember
what I wrote about.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.014
Mustn't have been too memorable then.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.716
Guess not.
Maybe that's why I only got a C minus.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.855
Okay, so listen...

02:35.889 --> 02:37.823
We need to talk about the extreme team.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.225
Okay...

02:40.661 --> 02:42.161
Our new coach, Natalie,

02:43.564 --> 02:45.204
I am not that impressed with her.

02:45.257 --> 02:47.200
Tell me about it.
I nearly quit after last practice.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.801
Well,
do you believe how she favors Olivia?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.536
It's completely unfair.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.238
We have to do something about it.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.606
Like what?

02:53.640 --> 02:55.007
I don't know yet...

02:55.042 --> 02:57.310
but in a few years when I
leave to pursue my solo career,

02:57.344 --> 02:58.945
you should be the one to
replace me as headliner,

02:58.979 --> 03:00.246
not Olivia.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.281
Me? Are you serious?!

03:02.316 --> 03:05.718
Don't be so modest. You're amazing.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.687
With a little more experience,

03:07.721 --> 03:09.889
there'll be nothing to stop you.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.657
Hey, I'm starving.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.859
- Do you wanna share something?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.261
Okay, cool.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.402
Minnie was fine this morning.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.870
Well, I've seen this before.

03:24.905 --> 03:29.008
If the mare's sick,
she'll stop producin' milk.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.210
You were right, Jack. It's colic.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.612
How bad?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.280
It's bad.
I need to get her to the clinic

03:34.314 --> 03:36.082
while she's still standing.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.084
I'll hitch up the trailer.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.027
No, that's not what we agreed on,
Nicole.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.096
No I know, but an extra week?

03:50.130 --> 03:52.632
I don't think I can be
away from home that long.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.766
Thanks for coming out there. I really
enjoyed spending the time with you.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.668
I love New York. I just...

03:55.702 --> 03:57.436
I can't pick up and
leave whenever I want.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.971
It takes planning.

04:01.213 --> 04:02.308
Okay.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.266
Take care of yourself. Nice seeing you.

04:06.424 --> 04:07.216
Good to see you too.

04:07.295 --> 04:09.482
Uh, I'm gonna have to think about this.
I'll call you back.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.950
All right, drive safe.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.952
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.788
Okay, bye.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.325
Uh, hey!

04:19.358 --> 04:20.760
Hey.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.528
Uh, I got your message.

04:22.562 --> 04:23.896
You wanted to talk to me?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.464
Oh, yeah, right um...

04:25.499 --> 04:27.867
I was thinking it would be good idea

04:27.901 --> 04:31.237
for you to move your trailer
back over here. If you want.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.638
Aren't you
the one that told me

04:32.673 --> 04:34.307
to move it to Caleb's
in the first place?

04:34.341 --> 04:36.642
Yes, but it would be nice
to know someone was here

04:36.677 --> 04:39.512
looking over the place while I
was in New York.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.248
Just keep it away from
the cabins outta sight,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.417
far away from the cabins.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.951
All right, you're the boss.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.488
Eh, you got a second?
I wanna show you something.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.856
Sure.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.959
And this is just the latest bite mark.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.328
Poor guy.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.029
I wouldn't feel too sorry for him.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.497
Dawson gives as good as he gets.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.333
Well, who's he fighting with?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.702
Percy over there.
I've separated the two for now,

05:02.736 --> 05:05.805
but come summer we're gonna
need both guys for trail rides.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.239
I don't want to risk someone gettin'
hurt

05:07.274 --> 05:08.841
if one lashes out at the other.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.476
I'll have Amy take a look at them.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.511
Okay, thanks.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.314
Is that it?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.718
- Yeah.
- What about check-ins?

05:20.187 --> 05:21.954
Check-ins?
Isn't that more your department?

05:21.988 --> 05:25.558
I thought I saw you with a
guest. Was she checking in?

05:25.592 --> 05:29.614
Uh, no,
no she wasn't a guest.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.931
Oh, my mistake.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.934
Let me know what Amy says, okay?

05:40.407 --> 05:43.242
Okay, Minnie, let's go.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.611
I know, baby.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.414
I know.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.451
It's okay,
it's okay!

05:52.486 --> 05:53.853
We'll be back.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.423
Is she's gonna be okay, Ty?

05:57.457 --> 05:59.759
It depends on what's causing the colic.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.963
And I'm not sure, but sometimes...
Thanks, Jack.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.431
Sometimes during a difficult birth

06:05.465 --> 06:07.233
the abdominal wall can tear.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.634
If that's what happened it's bad.

06:08.668 --> 06:10.703
Okay, but you can fix that.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.139
I won't know until I get to the clinic,
Amy.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.074
Ty, the foals beat the odds,
both of them. They survived.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.643
We can't let that happen to her mom.
You've gotta help her!

06:17.677 --> 06:19.912
Giving birth to twins is
traumatic for a horse, okay,

06:19.946 --> 06:21.313
and we knew there was a risk.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.715
I know,
but I thought we were passed this!

06:22.749 --> 06:24.183
I thought she was okay!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.618
Well, so did I.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.186
You're all set.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.922
Thanks, Jack.
I'll call you from the clinic, okay?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.290
Okay.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.578

sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

07:20.574 --> 07:23.476
My parents want me to go to college,

07:23.510 --> 07:26.245
but I know that trick riding's what
I really want to do with my life.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.613
You're gonna be a huge star one day.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.048
So are you!

07:29.082 --> 07:31.550
But it's not gonna happen
unless we make it happen.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.986
We have to work twice as
hard as the other girls.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.355
We can't let anyone get in our way,
not Natalie,

07:36.389 --> 07:38.023
definitely not Olivia.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.827
Look what I've got!

07:41.862 --> 07:44.163
- Hi, we uh...
- Oh hi.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.998
Stopped at the pet store.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.600
Katie was really
interested in the puppies,

07:47.634 --> 07:50.836
but I managed to talk
her down to a goldfish!

07:50.871 --> 07:52.938
Um Sam, this is my little sister, Katie,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.306
and my grandpa Tim.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.141
I still can't get used that,

07:56.176 --> 07:58.477
But I am. I'm grandpa. Nice to meet you.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.945
Hi, so nice to meet you.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.981
So, uh, I hate to break this up,

08:02.015 --> 08:03.649
but we gotta get you home for dinner,
Georgie.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.985
Oh, it's okay.
I was just on my way out, so.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.419
See you at practice tomorrow?

08:07.454 --> 08:09.555
- Definitely.
- Okay. Bye.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.624
- Nice to meet you, Sam.
- Pleased to meet you.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.426
Okay, slow down, honey.
Got a new friend?

08:14.461 --> 08:17.763
Yeah, yeah, she's pretty awesome.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.738
- Ty, how's Minnie?
- Not good.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.139
Unfortunately I was right.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.541
There's a tear in her abdominal wall,

08:28.575 --> 08:30.409
but I'm going into surgery
right now to repair it.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.912
Okay.

08:32.946 --> 08:36.048
Look, if she makes it through the
surgery she has a fighting chance,

08:36.082 --> 08:37.716
Okay, I love you.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.219
I love you too.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.222
Amy, tell me something,
why is it that online dating

08:43.256 --> 08:46.692
has made everyone so uncouth?
Like what ever happened to discretion?

08:46.726 --> 08:48.093
What are you talking about?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.229
Mitch. He brought his
latest internet conquest

08:50.263 --> 08:51.697
to work with him today.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.933
Like, there goes professionalism, right?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.302
Lou, this really isn't a good time.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.937
What's going on?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.940
Actually, could you give me a hand?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.341
Okay.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.711
Come here.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.212
Sometimes it takes them awhile

09:07.247 --> 09:10.115
to get used to the bottle.
Hope their mom'll be home soon.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.752
Minnie's gonna make it, you know.
She just gave birth to twins.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.689
She's tough. Good. There you go.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.626
So, Mitch has a girlfriend?

09:20.660 --> 09:22.628
We don't need to talk about that, Amy.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.931
You have way more important
things to worry about.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.334
Actually, I could use the distraction.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.537
So did you actually meet her?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.940
No, I just saw her and uh...

09:34.975 --> 09:36.942
"girlfriend" is a generous term, okay?

09:36.977 --> 09:39.778
This girl is obviously some
college co-ed he met online.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.014
Not that I care.
I mean, Mitch can date whoever he wants.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.817
I just wish he wouldn't bring his
bimbos to work with him that's all.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.320
I sound like a crazy ex-girlfriend,
don't I?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.989
Yeah, just a little bit.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.458
Do you think I made a mistake
not pursuing things with Mitch?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.095
You know what, don't answer that.
I can't go back there.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.998
I need to move forward. Career. Family.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.667
That's my focus right now.
That's what's important.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.169
All though my career is
taking me away from my family,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.839
so I guess that makes me the
world's biggest hypocrite.

10:06.873 --> 10:09.174
I thought you were just going
to New York for like a week.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.976
Yeah,
well one week has turned into two weeks,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.611
plus investor meetings all summer

10:12.646 --> 10:15.047
and it's only gonna get busier
once we launch in the fall.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.682
Are you having second thoughts?

10:16.716 --> 10:21.153
Yeah. Big, huge,
like Godzilla-size second thoughts.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.223
Where's Minnie? What happened?

10:24.257 --> 10:25.924
Ty had to take her to the clinic.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.794
She colicked and she's in surgery.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.964
Wow, surgery. Is she gonna be okay?

10:31.998 --> 10:34.667
- We don't know.
- Oh.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.236
Well, um, I want to help.
What could I do?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.604
I have to head back to the dude ranch.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.873
- Why don't you take over for me?
- Yeah, yeah sure.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.709
Come on.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.399
You're okay. Come here.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.250
Aren't you hungry? No?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.651
Come on.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.887
You gotta get enough.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.857
You remember this? This tastes good.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.359
Come on.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.795
Just make sure you get
the bottle angled up.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.830
Is it true what they
say about orphan foals,

11:04.864 --> 11:08.067
that things don't always go so well?

11:08.101 --> 11:11.770
Well, they're not orphaned yet, okay?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.405
We can't think like that,
and Ty's gonna do

11:13.440 --> 11:15.974
everything he can to make
sure that doesn't happen.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.017
All right!

11:25.051 --> 11:27.019
Can Bubbles sleep in my room tonight?

11:27.053 --> 11:30.570
I don't see why not.
Here, uh, get down...

11:31.157 --> 11:33.692
Now wait and hold this carefully.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.495
Okay, walk slowly. Don't spill it.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.465
Tim,
are you sure this is a good idea?

11:41.132 --> 11:43.230
What difference does it make
where she puts the bowl?

11:43.322 --> 11:46.872
I'm talkin' about buyin'
Katie a pet without asking Lou first.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.707
It's not a pet. It's a goldfish.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.743
Oh, yeah,
it might just be a goldfish,

11:50.777 --> 11:52.277
but keepin' that thing alive

11:52.312 --> 11:54.246
takes a certain amount
of responsibility.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.082
You don't have to walk it.
She's got a pony, Jack.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.784
A pony that we take care of.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.787
Now if she puts the bowl in her bedroom

12:01.821 --> 12:05.424
it becomes entirely her responsibility.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.726
And you don't think that's a
good lesson for Katie to learn?

12:07.761 --> 12:10.496
Well, maybe so,
but in case you've never met, Lou,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.264
she tends to have certain opinions

12:12.298 --> 12:13.832
when it comes to her daughters.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.101
She may think that
Katie's not ready yet.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.270
What kind of world are
we living in where a man

12:18.304 --> 12:21.273
can't buy a goldfish
for his granddaughter?

12:23.543 --> 12:25.577
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.374
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:56.810 --> 13:00.065
- Ah, what'd Amy say?
- About what?

13:00.724 --> 13:03.415
- Percy and Dawson.
- Oh right, the trail ride horses.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.951
Um, you know I didn't
want to bug her about it.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.753
Amy's got a lot on the go right now.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.823
Minnie's at the vet clinic with surgery

13:10.857 --> 13:13.025
so Amy has to bottle
feed the foals so...

13:13.059 --> 13:15.227
- Oh, sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.429
Look, uh, I'm no Amy Fleming

13:17.463 --> 13:18.831
but I think the best
thing for those guys

13:18.865 --> 13:20.465
is just to take
'em on a trail ride together,

13:20.500 --> 13:21.831
you know, get 'em used to each other.

13:21.871 --> 13:24.496
That's a good idea. Maybe you and
grandpa could do that tomorrow.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.039
Or we could.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.375
Uh, like you and me?

13:31.845 --> 13:35.247
Yeah. Well, it's not a
- it's not a problem, is it?

13:37.183 --> 13:40.352
No, no, it's not a problem. It's just...

13:40.386 --> 13:43.555
this is a very busy time for me so...

13:43.590 --> 13:46.558
Oh. So it's,
it's not because you can't avoid me

13:46.593 --> 13:48.527
if we go on a remote
trail ride together?

13:49.963 --> 13:52.598
Mitch, I am not avoiding you.
That's ridiculous.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.400
Great. So what do you
say we leave mid-morning?

13:55.435 --> 13:56.902
Fine. I'll see you then.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.704
Good.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.038
Okay.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.644
Damn it.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.051
Okay,
if we stick to this feeding schedule

14:13.086 --> 14:14.887
it should be pretty manageable.

14:14.921 --> 14:18.156
If you call waking up
at 3:00 am manageable.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.292
Georgie,
these foals have to be bottle fed

14:20.326 --> 14:23.228
every couple hours,
that's just the way it is.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.530
Speaking of, it's been so crazy here

14:25.565 --> 14:27.232
that we haven't even
given them a name yet.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.935
I was thinking...

14:29.969 --> 14:32.938
Theodore and Boone?
Or Theo and Boo for short?

14:32.972 --> 14:36.275
Theo and Boo. I like that.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.881
How's Minnie doing?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.783
The surgery went really well.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.085
- That's a huge relief.
- She's not out of the woods yet,

14:47.120 --> 14:49.721
- but she's puttin' up a good fight.
- Okay.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.990
Do you think she'll be
back to nurse her foals?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.960
Uh, yeah, she will if she recovers.

14:54.994 --> 14:56.962
If she recovers? So she might not?

14:59.499 --> 15:03.235
She's got a good shot,
Georgie, okay, it's just...

15:03.269 --> 15:05.604
it's touch and go right now, and, uh,

15:05.638 --> 15:07.406
Cass is keeping an eye on her overnight.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.675
I'm gonna call her in the morning and...

15:09.709 --> 15:12.477
- we'll see where we're at.
- Okay.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.517
Oh, okay, Ty, wake up.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.161
It's time to feed the foals,
come on.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.533
- Ty, let's go!
- Okay. Okay, okay, I'm up.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.697
Wow, Theo's hungry.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.177
This is Boone.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.645
That's Theo...

15:46.679 --> 15:49.614
and we've actually been having
a hard time getting him to eat.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.917
You know what, Ty?
You can go back upstairs

15:51.951 --> 15:54.019
and I'll spend some
time trying with him.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.420
Oh no, no, no I'll stay up.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.155
I'm used to working night
shifts at the clinic.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.891
- You sure?
- Besides we're in this together.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.226
Okay.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.033
I remember after Lou first had Katie.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.536
Oh man, her and Peter would
be up all hours of the night

16:11.571 --> 16:14.139
just feeding, changing diapers.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.875
I actually
don't know how they managed.

16:16.909 --> 16:20.312
That's gonna be us soon you know?

16:20.346 --> 16:23.382
I guess nothing can really
prepare you for parenthood,

16:23.416 --> 16:26.051
but if anything could,
having these foals

16:26.085 --> 16:28.120
is pretty good practice,
don't you think?

16:31.090 --> 16:32.424
Ty.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.502
Uh, our old coach never made us do laps.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.670
Hoo!

16:45.705 --> 16:48.140
Come, on girls, coach is timing us.

16:49.669 --> 16:52.377
I heard that Olivia's parents
bought her way onto the team.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.678
No wonder she gets special treatment.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.547
You know she is a pretty
good trick rider though.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.549
Not as good as we are.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.886
Come on, we're not gonna
let Olivia win this, are we?

17:08.594 --> 17:10.362
Looks like we've got
two live ones this morning.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.131
The rest of you pick up the pace!
Come on let's go!

17:19.105 --> 17:21.239
Yeah, Like it was a new stunt
like no one knew really how to do.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.141
It kind of looked easy,
like you were great.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.675
- No, it was fine.
- She always got it.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.546
- Yeah, she got it.
- Yeah.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.981
Honestly, if you ever want help,
like I'm...

17:30.016 --> 17:32.084
- I'm here. Just ask me whenever.
- Really? That would be so great.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.852
- Hello?
- Okay. I'll see you later.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.954
Hey, Mom, what's up?

17:37.957 --> 17:41.860
You can't expect me to
remember everything.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.428
Oh my God.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.632
I'll look for it When I get home, okay?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.868
Why are you being such a spaz...?

17:56.342 --> 17:58.844
Olivia, you're up.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.150
Ah!

18:11.357 --> 18:13.325
Olivia! Are you okay?

18:13.359 --> 18:14.693
Oh my gosh!

18:14.727 --> 18:16.895
- Olivia!
- That's gotta hurt.

18:20.941 --> 18:24.077
- Are you injured?
- No, I'm fine.

18:24.111 --> 18:26.145
I don't know what happened.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.581
Well, your cinch was loose.

18:28.616 --> 18:30.283
What?

18:30.317 --> 18:31.818
Even my 9-year-old students

18:31.852 --> 18:33.419
know they're supposed to
double check their saddle

18:33.454 --> 18:34.787
before they ride.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.725
I swear I tightened my cinch.
I know that I did!

18:38.759 --> 18:41.060
Well, then you were careless.

18:42.064 --> 18:44.797
I expected more from you, Olivia.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.700
I'm sorry. Should I go again?

18:47.735 --> 18:49.969
No, no, no, you've had your chance.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.337
I could go next.

18:51.372 --> 18:53.640
All right, let's see what you got.

19:15.127 --> 19:17.495
Whoa.

19:17.529 --> 19:19.853
You could be a little snappier
getting out of the end of the neck,

19:20.011 --> 19:21.555
but overall nice job.

19:21.713 --> 19:23.428
Thanks.

19:23.634 --> 19:25.101
Are you okay?

19:25.136 --> 19:28.104
I tightened my cinch
and I know that I did.

19:28.139 --> 19:30.707
This is so unfair.

19:30.741 --> 19:32.275
Georgie!

19:32.310 --> 19:34.577
Let's see if you can follow that.

19:44.822 --> 19:46.156
Okay, Katie,
do you wanna wear this sweater

19:46.190 --> 19:47.757
or the pink one for your play date?

19:47.792 --> 19:50.727
- Um, pink!
- There you go.

19:52.430 --> 19:53.964
Katie, what's this?

19:53.998 --> 19:56.470
Who got you a goldfish?

19:57.034 --> 19:58.401
Grandpa.

19:58.436 --> 19:59.803
He did, did he?

19:59.837 --> 20:02.908
Yeah. Shh... Bubbles is sleeping.

20:08.646 --> 20:11.448
- Hey, dad?
- Exactly.

20:11.482 --> 20:13.416
You bought Katie a goldfish?

20:13.451 --> 20:14.985
Yeah.

20:15.019 --> 20:17.620
- You didn't talk to me first?
- Well, it's a goldfish, Lou.

20:17.655 --> 20:19.055
Well,
look we can we talk about this later.

20:19.090 --> 20:22.092
- We gotta feed these foals.
- Yeah, Bubbles is dead.

20:22.126 --> 20:24.862
What?! Already?!

20:24.962 --> 20:28.164
Yeah, Katie thinks he's having a nap.

20:28.199 --> 20:29.799
Well,
the pet store sold me a defective fish.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.201
I'll go back immediately

20:31.235 --> 20:32.635
and I'll demand a new one.

20:32.670 --> 20:34.204
No, no, no, don't do that.
Look, I'm Katie to a play date,

20:34.238 --> 20:36.673
when we get back I want
you to sit her down

20:36.707 --> 20:39.409
and tell her Bubbles
isn't just sleeping, okay?

20:39.443 --> 20:40.844
No, you do that.

20:40.878 --> 20:43.431
I'm not the one who
bought her a goldfish!

20:43.914 --> 20:45.700
- Okay, fine.
- Good.

20:47.018 --> 20:48.952
- Lou...
- What?

20:48.986 --> 20:50.887
Amy told me that you're having
second thoughts about New York

20:50.921 --> 20:52.522
and I think you should
look at the bigger picture.

20:52.556 --> 20:54.424
Dad, I don't have time to
talk about this right now.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.793
Honey, you don't want to
pass up this opportunity.

20:56.827 --> 20:59.429
- You don't want regrets.
- Hey, stop pressurin' her.

20:59.463 --> 21:01.831
Uh...

21:01.866 --> 21:04.067
Lou has to make up her own
mind about goin' to New York.

21:04.101 --> 21:06.036
Besides,
the only reason you want her to go there

21:06.070 --> 21:08.338
in the first place is to
keep her away from Mitch.

21:08.372 --> 21:12.681
- That's a fringe benefit.
- Well, it's not up to you, is it?

21:13.544 --> 21:17.113
And by the way, I told you so.

21:17.982 --> 21:19.349
What are you talking about?

21:19.383 --> 21:21.851
The goldfish. I told you so!

21:21.886 --> 21:24.821
And it's very satisfying
to be able to say that,

21:24.855 --> 21:28.861
so I'm gonna say it again. I. Told.
You. So.

21:29.693 --> 21:31.828
That feels good.

21:34.365 --> 21:36.032
Are you sure that's what you saw?

21:36.067 --> 21:40.403
Yeah, she loosened her cinch.
It was clear as day.

21:40.438 --> 21:41.805
What are you gonna do?

21:41.839 --> 21:45.508
I don't know.
I don't know anything right now.

21:45.543 --> 21:49.479
Minnie's still sick and now I've
got this essay to worry about.

21:49.513 --> 21:51.181
Do you want me to read
what you have so far?

21:51.215 --> 21:53.149
Um, yeah, sure.

21:55.453 --> 21:59.956
My most memorable moment was
when I was Roman riding at a rodeo.

21:59.990 --> 22:04.194
At the last minute I decided
to take a difficult jump.

22:04.228 --> 22:05.595
That's it?

22:05.629 --> 22:08.064
Well, what else am I supposed to say?

22:08.099 --> 22:10.533
I jumped. It was awesome. End of story.

22:10.568 --> 22:12.735
Performing at a rodeo is
a huge accomplishment,

22:12.770 --> 22:14.637
but that doesn't make it memorable.

22:14.672 --> 22:16.573
So you think I should
write about something else?

22:16.607 --> 22:20.643
No. I just think you should
dig a little deeper that's all.

22:23.614 --> 22:26.216
Where do you want to sit?

22:26.250 --> 22:28.451
- She's here.
- Who?

22:28.486 --> 22:29.853
Sam.

22:29.887 --> 22:32.288
- What?
- I'll be right back.

22:37.027 --> 22:38.561
Hey, so what are we doing tonight?

22:38.596 --> 22:40.163
Sam.

22:40.197 --> 22:42.265
Hey, Georgie!

22:42.299 --> 22:43.933
Pretty killer practice today, huh?

22:43.968 --> 22:45.635
Yeah, yeah it was awesome.

22:45.669 --> 22:48.204
Um, can I ask you something?

22:48.239 --> 22:50.106
Yeah, of course, shoot.

22:51.575 --> 22:53.309
Did you loosen Olivia's
saddle this morning?

22:53.344 --> 22:55.979
Is that what I saw you do?

22:58.149 --> 23:02.085
If I had loosened
Olivia's saddle slightly,

23:02.119 --> 23:03.920
then what's the big deal?

23:03.954 --> 23:06.890
Olivia got what she deserved,
and as far as I'm concerned

23:06.924 --> 23:09.993
if nobody saw then it didn't happen.

23:10.027 --> 23:12.428
Right, but I did see something.

23:12.463 --> 23:15.365
Well, that can just be a
little secret between friends.

23:19.887 --> 23:22.355
Hey, I was thinking we
should do a trick together.

23:22.389 --> 23:25.325
Maybe doubles Roman riding
or something like that.

23:25.359 --> 23:27.327
I think we'd make a pretty great team,
don't you?

23:27.361 --> 23:30.970
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That'd be fun.

23:31.131 --> 23:32.665
Great. Meet me before practice tomorrow

23:32.700 --> 23:34.467
and we can figure some stuff out.

23:34.501 --> 23:36.169
Sure.

23:38.038 --> 23:40.340
Cool.

23:42.776 --> 23:44.143
Bye.

23:45.813 --> 23:47.980
Hey, I don't know about
you guys but I'm starving?

23:48.015 --> 23:49.549
Where's the food at?

23:49.583 --> 23:50.950
I'm so hungry.

23:54.521 --> 23:57.427
So headed to New York next week.

23:57.797 --> 23:59.525
Must be pretty exciting.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.728
Actually, I'm not sure I'm going.

24:01.762 --> 24:04.330
Really? Why's that?

24:04.365 --> 24:06.566
I don't know.
This whole franchise thing...

24:06.600 --> 24:09.802
One week in New York turned
into way more than that.

24:09.837 --> 24:12.250
I don't know what to do.

24:12.873 --> 24:15.475
You know, before I join the military

24:15.509 --> 24:18.478
I,
I didn't really know what to do either.

24:18.512 --> 24:21.714
I remember I asked my dad
what he though should do.

24:21.749 --> 24:24.584
He said that he figured I
already knew what I wanted,

24:24.618 --> 24:27.887
I just had to find
the strength to do it.

24:27.921 --> 24:30.890
So, you know, the next week I signed up.

24:30.924 --> 24:32.470
Just like that?

24:32.563 --> 24:34.861
Well, I mean there was a few
sleepless nights in there,

24:34.895 --> 24:37.463
some paralyzing doubts, but uh...

24:38.899 --> 24:41.494
it ended up being the right decision.

24:42.536 --> 24:45.037
What do you think I should do?

24:45.072 --> 24:46.639
I think you should stay,

24:46.673 --> 24:50.643
but only because I'm gonna
miss having you around.

24:50.677 --> 24:52.678
I'm sure you'll be glad to
have me outta your hair.

24:52.713 --> 24:54.280
What are you kidding me?

24:54.314 --> 24:56.416
What am I gonna do without
your five page to-do lists?

24:56.450 --> 24:59.519
- I can't handle all that free time.
- Oh, you'll be just fine,

24:59.553 --> 25:02.622
especially considering
your busy social life.

25:02.656 --> 25:04.557
Busy social life?
What's that supposed to mean?

25:04.591 --> 25:07.927
I just mean you have a lot
on the go when it comes to...

25:07.961 --> 25:09.328
friends.

25:12.065 --> 25:14.734
I know it's killing ya,
so why don't you just ask me?

25:14.768 --> 25:16.135
W-what are you talking about?

25:16.170 --> 25:18.938
The girl I was with yesterday
you want to know who she is.

25:18.972 --> 25:23.910
I do not. And even if I did,
it's none of my business.

25:23.944 --> 25:26.512
You're right. It's not.

25:37.224 --> 25:39.225
Tim is that you?

25:39.259 --> 25:41.127
Uh, right here.

25:45.766 --> 25:48.034
Out here, Jack.

25:50.637 --> 25:52.104
I'm uh...

25:52.139 --> 25:55.675
I'm headin' into town.
I've got an appointment so...

25:55.709 --> 25:58.478
- Good day for a drive.
- Yeah, I guess.

25:58.512 --> 26:01.113
Listen, they're deliverin' fuel today,
so I'm wonderin'

26:01.148 --> 26:04.450
if you can be here,
unlock the tank for 'em.

26:04.485 --> 26:06.986
Yeah, sure, no problem,
I got it covered.

26:07.020 --> 26:08.988
Cream?

26:09.022 --> 26:11.324
Sure.

26:14.528 --> 26:16.429
The only reason I'm askin' is

26:16.463 --> 26:18.030
'cause Mitch is busy at the dude ranch

26:18.065 --> 26:20.933
and I don't think he's gonna
get back here in time so...

26:20.968 --> 26:22.835
Yeah, no problem.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.138
Drive safe.

26:26.173 --> 26:27.507
Okay.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.014
How's it goin' now?

26:36.450 --> 26:38.284
Not great.
Boone drank no problem,

26:38.318 --> 26:42.188
but just can't get him to suck.
Come on, Theo.

26:42.222 --> 26:45.658
Well, he was suckling from
his Mom so it's not dysphasia.

26:45.692 --> 26:48.227
Do you want to try bucket feeding him?

26:48.262 --> 26:51.063
Yeah, I'd just be worried we
couldn't get him back on the mare.

26:51.098 --> 26:52.732
Well, I think we're gonna
have to use a syringe then.

26:52.766 --> 26:54.133
You mean force feed him?

26:54.167 --> 26:55.635
It's either that or tube feeding,

26:55.669 --> 26:57.069
which is pretty invasive,

26:57.104 --> 26:58.871
so that should be our last resort.

26:58.906 --> 27:02.241
Maybe he just needs his mom.

27:02.276 --> 27:04.143
She's still recovering from the surgery,
Georgie,

27:04.177 --> 27:05.545
and even if we brought her here

27:05.579 --> 27:07.280
she might not produce enough milk.

27:07.314 --> 27:09.882
Well,
can't at least try?

27:09.917 --> 27:11.651
No, it's too soon.

27:11.685 --> 27:13.686
I'm really sorry,
Georgie, we just can't.

27:17.090 --> 27:18.958
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- What's killing me?

27:18.992 --> 27:21.494
Not knowing. The girl. It's killing you.

27:23.964 --> 27:26.432
Okay, I admit it was on my
mind for like a nanosecond.

27:26.466 --> 27:27.833
Right, sure.

27:29.269 --> 27:31.637
Are you gonna tell me or not?

27:33.674 --> 27:36.042
Do you remember that cousin
I told you about, Zach,

27:36.076 --> 27:39.545
we served in Afghanistan together?
Of course I remember.

27:39.580 --> 27:42.848
Well,
after he died he left someone behind...

27:42.883 --> 27:44.250
a widow.

27:46.053 --> 27:47.420
Sometimes we get together and talk.

27:47.454 --> 27:49.755
That's who you saw at the dude ranch.

27:49.790 --> 27:52.291
Not somebody I met online or...

27:52.326 --> 27:54.627
and even remotely
romantically involved with.

27:54.661 --> 27:56.162
We're just friends.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.631
Okay, now I feel like a fool.

27:58.665 --> 28:00.800
I'm so sorry for prying.

28:02.803 --> 28:05.471
Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa!

28:05.505 --> 28:07.573
- Whoa!
- Mitch!

28:07.608 --> 28:09.241
Oh my God. Are you okay?

28:09.276 --> 28:11.377
Yeah. Ah, I'm fine.

28:12.813 --> 28:14.213
It's not the first time
I fell off a horse.

28:14.247 --> 28:15.426
I doubt it's gonna be the last.

28:15.518 --> 28:18.017
Are you sure you're okay?
You're not just saying that

28:18.051 --> 28:19.952
to be a tough cowboy but
really your leg is broken

28:19.987 --> 28:22.722
or your lung is punctured or something?

28:22.756 --> 28:26.468
- I'm fine. I promise.
- Okay.

28:28.528 --> 28:30.463
Maybe Percy and Dawson
aren't really ready

28:30.497 --> 28:32.698
to go on a trail ride after all.

28:32.733 --> 28:34.734
You know, it's funny...

28:34.768 --> 28:37.837
Sometimes they fight
like mortal enemies,

28:37.871 --> 28:40.706
but most of the time they
get along surprisingly well.

28:42.142 --> 28:43.509
Mitch, I...

29:05.946 --> 29:07.914
Someone's in a chipper mood.

29:07.948 --> 29:09.782
What? Me?! No.

29:09.817 --> 29:11.918
Well, you just seem happy is all.

29:11.952 --> 29:14.787
Well, I don't know why 'cause
nothing special happened today, so...

29:14.822 --> 29:16.155
Okay.

29:16.190 --> 29:18.458
Hey, dinner's gonan be in about an hour!

29:18.492 --> 29:20.260
All right.

29:24.527 --> 29:26.232
- Lou?
- Mmm?

29:27.801 --> 29:29.802
Is that...?

29:29.837 --> 29:33.076
Bubbles. Yup. It's a miracle.

29:33.574 --> 29:37.857
Oh. So are ya,
are you sure that he was...

29:38.279 --> 29:40.079
you know dead?

29:40.114 --> 29:42.415
100 percent sure.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.050
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

29:44.084 --> 29:45.618
No I did not,

29:45.653 --> 29:48.454
but I got a pretty good idea who did.

29:52.159 --> 29:54.394
What is the big deal?
It's just a goldfish!

29:54.428 --> 29:58.631
It's not just a goldfish!
It's Katie's pet and it died,

29:58.666 --> 30:00.800
and now you're lyin' to her!

30:00.834 --> 30:03.937
I'm not lyin'.
I don't see that as lying.

30:08.576 --> 30:10.977
I just want her to stay
innocent a little longer.

30:11.011 --> 30:15.415
Well, Lou and I talked it
over and we both agreed,

30:15.449 --> 30:17.650
it's time to start tellin'
Katie the truth

30:17.685 --> 30:20.053
when it comes to animals dyin'
around the ranch.

30:20.087 --> 30:21.788
It's a part of life

30:21.822 --> 30:25.358
and we can't protect her
from those things forever.

30:25.392 --> 30:26.993
I don't want to be involved in that.

30:27.027 --> 30:29.629
I bought her that fish to
make her happy, not sad.

30:29.663 --> 30:32.265
Fine, be a coward. I'll tell her myself.

30:38.906 --> 30:40.607
You sure you don't want
to come down for dinner?

30:40.641 --> 30:43.343
Yeah,
I really need to work on this essay.

30:43.377 --> 30:45.578
Okay, well, you gotta eat so...

30:45.613 --> 30:47.447
Thanks.

30:48.849 --> 30:50.483
Do you want me to take a look at it?

30:50.517 --> 30:52.118
I'm a pretty good editor.

30:52.152 --> 30:55.288
Um, actually maybe once I'm done.

30:55.322 --> 30:56.689
Okay.

30:57.828 --> 31:00.693
You know, there's one more thing...

31:00.728 --> 31:04.240
this whole Maggie's venture in New York,

31:04.675 --> 31:07.200
it's gonna take a little
longer than expected,

31:07.234 --> 31:10.470
a week longer to be exact and
then back and forth all summer

31:10.504 --> 31:12.171
if things go well with the investors...

31:12.206 --> 31:14.474
We're gonna be fine.

31:14.508 --> 31:17.106
- What?
- Katie and I.

31:17.370 --> 31:19.846
If that's what you're worried about,
don't be.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.849
I'm gonna miss you,
but we're gonna be okay.

31:22.883 --> 31:26.052
That is a remarkably
mature thing to say.

31:26.086 --> 31:28.223
- It is?
- Yeah.

31:28.989 --> 31:30.757
You're all grown up.

31:30.791 --> 31:32.525
When did that happen?

31:47.641 --> 31:49.942
So who did you invite to your tea party?

31:49.977 --> 31:52.111
- Quakers.
- Quakers?

31:54.448 --> 31:56.249
K-Katie...

31:56.283 --> 31:59.218
there's somethin'
that I need to tell you

31:59.253 --> 32:01.921
about your pet Bubbles.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.191
What is it, gg?

32:05.225 --> 32:06.592
Well...

32:07.826 --> 32:10.930
You see the truth is that this...
well...

32:14.601 --> 32:17.090
Bubbles here is...

32:19.840 --> 32:22.775
Oh, Bubbles is hungry and I
think you better feed him.

32:31.885 --> 32:34.353
He's not swallowing.

32:36.223 --> 32:37.990
Okay, this syringe isn't working.

32:38.025 --> 32:39.392
We're gonna have to tube feed him.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.094
No, you said that was a last resort!

32:41.128 --> 32:42.562
Well,
I think we've run out of options, Amy.

32:42.596 --> 32:44.363
No we haven't, Ty.

32:44.398 --> 32:47.400
Georgie's right. He just needs his mom.

32:47.434 --> 32:49.602
Amy, I told you, it's too soon.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.437
We have to try.

32:54.274 --> 32:55.975
- Hey, Georgie!
- Sam.

32:58.078 --> 32:59.946
Oh, I was thinking of some
tricks we can do together

32:59.980 --> 33:01.681
that'll be real show stoppers.

33:01.715 --> 33:03.082
Let's start on something easy

33:03.117 --> 33:04.550
and then work our way
up to the harder stuff.

33:04.585 --> 33:08.821
Before we start anything,
I need to say something.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.223
Okay.

33:10.257 --> 33:11.657
I think you should come
clean to the Natalie

33:11.692 --> 33:13.359
about what you did to Olivia.

33:13.393 --> 33:14.761
Why would I do that?

33:14.795 --> 33:16.162
Because we're supposed to be a team!

33:16.196 --> 33:17.930
We can't be working against
each other all the time.

33:17.965 --> 33:19.999
Look, don't be so naive.

33:20.033 --> 33:22.435
There are a lot of
talented trick riders.

33:22.469 --> 33:24.003
Sometimes you have to
bend the rules a little

33:24.037 --> 33:25.458
if you want to stand out.

33:25.498 --> 33:28.808
Putting Olivia's life a risk
isn't bending the rules.

33:28.842 --> 33:31.377
I did what I had to do.

33:31.411 --> 33:32.845
If I'm gonna have a solo career

33:32.880 --> 33:36.115
I need to maintain my
headliner status on this team.

33:36.150 --> 33:38.217
Look,
you might be okay with being mediocre,

33:38.252 --> 33:40.953
but I have bigger plans.

33:40.988 --> 33:43.322
I thought you said I was good
enough to be the next headliner.

33:43.357 --> 33:45.258
Well, I guess not.

33:45.292 --> 33:47.026
You clearly don't want it bad enough.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.594
I'm sure coach'll go easy on you

33:48.629 --> 33:49.996
if you just admit you made a mistake!

33:50.030 --> 33:53.366
- I'm not telling her anything!
- Then I will!

33:53.400 --> 33:56.369
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut.

33:56.403 --> 33:57.703
Or what? You'll loosen my saddle strap

33:57.738 --> 34:00.106
While I'm not looking?

34:00.140 --> 34:01.974
No. Loosening saddle straps will
seem like a kiss on the cheek

34:02.009 --> 34:04.377
compared to what I'll do to you.

34:05.402 --> 34:07.830
You two are here early.

34:09.616 --> 34:12.485
So are you.
Practice doesn't start for another hour.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.920
Well, I'm always here around this time.

34:13.954 --> 34:16.556
It's when I plan the routines.

34:16.590 --> 34:20.458
Georgie, why don't you give
Samantha and I a moment alone.

34:20.494 --> 34:22.411
We need to talk.

34:23.630 --> 34:25.398
Of course.

34:43.152 --> 34:44.520
Yeah.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.292
Good girl.

34:50.326 --> 34:51.793
We'll keep Boone separate for now,

34:51.828 --> 34:53.929
give Theo a chance to start feeding.

34:55.899 --> 34:58.867
Being back home is good for her.
I can tell.

35:02.105 --> 35:03.872
Well, we'll just have to wait.

35:03.907 --> 35:06.842
Hopefully she'll be able to nurse.

35:06.876 --> 35:08.744
She will.

35:10.313 --> 35:11.647
She will.

35:14.684 --> 35:17.319
So how'd your little talk
with Katie go about the fish?

35:17.353 --> 35:20.797
Oh, it didn't. I couldn't do it.

35:21.524 --> 35:22.891
Well, I guess we're both cowards.

35:22.926 --> 35:25.494
It's pathetic. It's pathetic.
I mean, two grown cowboys,

35:25.528 --> 35:28.330
we can't talk to a
5-year-old about a dead fish.

35:28.364 --> 35:31.300
So Katie has no idea about Bubbles.

35:31.334 --> 35:32.868
I thought you were gonna talk
to her about it, grandpa.

35:32.902 --> 35:34.603
I was but...

35:34.637 --> 35:36.805
B-but I, I will. I was going to.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.640
You were right.
I mean, I bought the fish for her

35:38.675 --> 35:40.542
I should be the one to tell her.

35:40.577 --> 35:44.379
- W-We'll both tell her.
- Yeah, well, yeah together.

35:44.414 --> 35:46.749
Maybe I should be there too.

35:48.451 --> 35:50.285
Hey, how's that mare doin'?

35:50.320 --> 35:52.721
Not producing milk yet,
but it's early still.

35:52.756 --> 35:56.158
Hey, um, you know while I have
you all here...

35:56.192 --> 36:00.462
I need to tell you something.
Uh, I've decided to pursue

36:00.497 --> 36:02.698
- the Maggie's franchise in New York.
- Huh!

36:02.732 --> 36:04.566
I must be crazy because
the last thing I want to do

36:04.601 --> 36:07.236
is leave my girls but,
you know, this opportunity,

36:07.270 --> 36:10.773
it's the start of something big,
the start of something I...

36:10.807 --> 36:12.407
I can't turn my back on.

36:12.442 --> 36:14.877
So, Dad, I know you're happy about this,

36:14.911 --> 36:18.147
but Amy and grandpa,
I need you both to be on board too,

36:18.181 --> 36:21.283
because when I'm gone I'm
gonna need you more than ever.

36:21.317 --> 36:23.485
Of course we support you!

36:23.520 --> 36:26.421
Lou, I am so excited for you.

36:26.456 --> 36:27.823
Thank you.

36:27.857 --> 36:30.092
Except you are leaving
me with all the boys.

36:30.126 --> 36:32.895
I'm totally outnumbered now.
Hey, are you kidding me?

36:32.929 --> 36:37.099
Come on, I'm ready all the
books on pregnancy I can find.

36:37.133 --> 36:39.601
She's in great hands.

36:41.037 --> 36:42.738
Thanks Dad.

36:42.772 --> 36:45.140
Samantha,
if you're not gonna own up to it

36:45.175 --> 36:47.276
then you leave me no choice.
I'm putting you on suspension.

36:47.310 --> 36:48.644
Indefinitely.

36:49.486 --> 36:51.464
Starting now.

36:57.995 --> 37:00.699
Sam. Sam, wait!

37:00.768 --> 37:02.246
You know, why you're never
gonna be a good trick rider?

37:02.298 --> 37:04.093
Because you just wait for
everything to fall into your lap!

37:04.172 --> 37:05.267
But life doesn't work like that.

37:05.319 --> 37:06.665
If you want something
you have to take it.

37:06.757 --> 37:08.301
And how's that working out for you?

37:08.380 --> 37:10.306
I tried to be nice to you, Georgie,

37:10.359 --> 37:12.501
but we're not friends. We never were.

37:14.093 --> 37:15.204
All right, ladies.

37:16.673 --> 37:19.832
As of today Samantha is on suspension.

37:20.376 --> 37:22.721
In the meantime I'm gonna
choose a new headliner,

37:22.813 --> 37:25.399
so I want you all to
bring you're A-game.

37:25.887 --> 37:27.816
Let's start with six
laps around the arena.

37:27.961 --> 37:29.689
Starting now.

37:30.853 --> 37:32.186
Let's go girls!

37:32.221 --> 37:33.955
Just so you know,
I'm gonna be the next headliner.

37:33.989 --> 37:35.556
Wouldn't count on it.

37:39.228 --> 37:41.462
Here's the thing, Katie...

37:42.407 --> 37:46.200
Yesterday I did something
that wasn't very nice.

37:46.235 --> 37:49.237
I replaced Bubbles
with a different fish.

37:49.271 --> 37:50.705
Why grandpa?

37:50.739 --> 37:54.468
Well, you see, Bubbles is...

37:57.312 --> 38:00.392
Dead. He's not coming back.

38:01.275 --> 38:05.853
The goldfish that's in your
bowl is a different goldfish.

38:05.888 --> 38:08.456
I'm, I'm really sorry, Katie.

38:08.917 --> 38:10.758
It's okay.

38:10.793 --> 38:13.828
Can I flush the dead
Bubbles down the toilet?

38:13.862 --> 38:15.263
What?

38:15.342 --> 38:18.599
Every time that the goldfish
dies in the big tank at school

38:18.634 --> 38:22.403
I get to flush it down the
toilet and it's really cool!

38:25.874 --> 38:29.510
- I already buried Bubbles in the yard.
- Mmm hmm.

38:29.545 --> 38:33.715
Uh right, right where I buried your
mom's goldfish when she was your age.

38:33.749 --> 38:37.585
Yeah, you see, we used to
have a little tradition and...

38:37.619 --> 38:39.812
What's a tradition?

38:40.445 --> 38:42.223
Well, we'll, we'll show you.

38:49.498 --> 38:51.032
Hey.

38:52.768 --> 38:54.569
Hey.

38:58.307 --> 39:00.441
- Listen I just wanted...
- Look about the...

39:00.476 --> 39:03.993
- Sorry, you go.
- No, you, you go.

39:05.414 --> 39:07.381
I decided to go to New York next week.

39:09.618 --> 39:13.955
You were right.
It's what I've always wanted I just...

39:13.989 --> 39:16.920
I had to find the strength
to jump in with both feet.

39:17.793 --> 39:20.390
I think you're making a good decision.

39:20.878 --> 39:22.430
Maybe what happened on the trail ride

39:22.464 --> 39:24.298
wasn't the best idea, Mitch.

39:25.569 --> 39:29.704
I mean, there's something between us,
that's undeniable,

39:29.738 --> 39:33.574
but this new business,
it's gonna be my entire life and...

39:33.609 --> 39:37.178
any time I have left I have
to spend with my girls so...

39:37.212 --> 39:39.046
Timing's bad.

39:39.081 --> 39:41.349
Yeah, no I know it's...

39:41.383 --> 39:43.217
it's kind of a running theme with us.

39:46.588 --> 39:49.290
I just wouldn't want you
to have to wait for me.

39:49.324 --> 39:51.159
That wouldn't be fair.

40:02.070 --> 40:03.938
Good luck in New York, Lou.

40:32.219 --> 40:34.951
Dig deeper.

41:21.136 --> 41:22.503
My original plan

41:22.537 --> 41:24.705
was to write a paper about trick riding.

41:24.739 --> 41:26.840
I figured my most memorable moment

41:26.875 --> 41:29.743
was the time I was
Roman riding at a rodeo.

41:29.778 --> 41:32.846
At the last minute I decided
to take a difficult jump

41:32.881 --> 41:35.082
and I totally nailed it,

41:35.116 --> 41:38.485
but then I realized that
it wasn't the Roman riding

41:38.520 --> 41:41.321
or the jump that made
that moment memorable,

41:41.356 --> 41:43.190
it was the people watching,

41:44.453 --> 41:48.128
and I'm not talking about the
random people sitting in the crowd,

41:48.163 --> 41:52.866
I'm talking about my people. My mom,
dad, sister, uncle,

41:52.901 --> 41:55.903
grandparents and great grandparents.

41:55.937 --> 42:00.708
So my most memorable moment was
in fact the day I was adopted,

42:02.377 --> 42:04.344
the day I got my people;

42:05.603 --> 42:09.415
the people who nag me to do
my homework and clean my room;

42:11.019 --> 42:12.553
the people who are always there for me

42:12.587 --> 42:15.055
even when we're miles apart;

42:20.929 --> 42:23.964
the people whose hearts are
always in the right place...

42:48.237 --> 42:50.524
The people who never seem to give up,

42:50.558 --> 42:51.892
no matter what.

42:59.334 --> 43:01.268
I guess it's true what they say...

43:01.302 --> 43:03.570
you don't get to pick your family,

43:03.605 --> 43:07.174
but when you're adopted the
opposite is also true...

43:07.208 --> 43:10.144
- your family gets to pick you.
- Oh my God!

43:10.178 --> 43:13.247
Maybe it was meant to
be or maybe it just sort of happened,

43:13.281 --> 43:15.682
Guys, this is just beautiful.

43:15.717 --> 43:18.336
but one thing I'm certain
of is that my most memorable moment

43:18.415 --> 43:21.121
was when these people became my people.

43:21.156 --> 43:23.624
- Okay, who wants cake?
- Me!

43:25.326 --> 43:27.327
The guest needs to cut the cake!

43:34.157 --> 43:35.188
On the next Heartland.

43:35.261 --> 43:37.371
You guys have been treating
my rodeo school

43:37.373 --> 43:39.306
like a country club
and that's gonna stop!

43:39.308 --> 43:42.042
Rodeo school
has its ups and downs.

43:42.044 --> 43:43.277
I can ride that horse.

43:43.279 --> 43:45.212
Tomorrow morning, rodeo grounds,

43:45.286 --> 43:45.866
be there.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.727
Heartland,
next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC.

43:48.811 --> 43:49.850
School is like a big joke...

43:51.587 --> 43:53.420
to me.
