No,no,no,no.

SUCRE: Got a question for you, Fish.

36:04.579 --> 36:08.041
What if we do all this work,
and the pipe is 10 feet that way?

36:08.124 --> 36:10.251
- It won't be.
- You got X-ray vision?

36:10.919 --> 36:13.922
I calculated the drill point coordinates,
hid them in my tattoo

36:14.005 --> 36:16.216
and then projected them
back onto the wall.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.427
Everything's been worked out
so the image hits the right spot.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.472
- It's just math.
- What if your math is wrong?

36:23.264 --> 36:26.184
You'll drill into one of a dozen gas lines
behind the wall.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.521
There'll be an explosion
and we'll be burned alive.

36:33.817 --> 36:36.111
But you're good at math, right?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.446

Come on!

37:48.975 --> 37:51.853
Yo, Stroke.
You got longer arms than me, man.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.595
They think it's hot now?
I want all the water shut off.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.932
- I'll call maintenance.
- Mack, you take care of it.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.309
MACK: Yes, sir.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.198
- Yeah, we have a problem.
- That's right.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.660
Yeah, Bob here has seen the hole.
He's gotta go away.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.958
No one's going anywhere.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.584
He's seen the hole.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.044
So have you.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.091
Looks like your lockdown idea
didn't work out too good, huh?

39:03.424 --> 39:05.468
I have a daughter. Please.

39:07.929 --> 39:11.224
- We gotta kill him.
- The cops are right outside.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.688
And they'll stay outside as long as
they know we're keeping him alive.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.107
But he's a guard. He's gonna squeal.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.986
What the hell does this have
to do with you, anyway?

39:23.069 --> 39:25.989
This is not any of your concern.

39:31.077 --> 39:35.206
See, Bob here knows about our secret.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.959
He knows about our escape.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.006
So it's all of our concern now, isn't it?

39:59.439 --> 40:00.857
(SCREAMING)

40:01.024 --> 40:03.359
Easy, big fellow. It's just me.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.487

Kid's probably dead already,
or wishing he was.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.124

- Haven't seen him since things jumped off.

- You understand?
- Go ahead. Stick me. Stick me.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.815
Let's see how many times I can shout out

40:42.899 --> 40:45.526
about your little hole in there
before I bleed out, huh?

40:45.610 --> 40:48.363
'Cause every con in here
is gonna know about your little escape

40:48.446 --> 40:51.366
before one drip of my blood hits the floor.

40:51.824 --> 40:55.411
So, you see, friends,
either I'm through that hole with you

40:55.495 --> 40:57.872

We're all locked out.
