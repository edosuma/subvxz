00:17.917 --> 00:19.041
I can't hold it in
any longer.

00:19.041 --> 00:19.792
But you should.

00:20.041 --> 00:23.417
Neal Gamby and I are
seeing each other.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.250
LEE RUSSELL:
It's that time of year again

00:25.250 --> 00:27.291
for the high school
assessment program.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.625
Shouldn't tests be
about learning?

00:29.625 --> 00:31.000
It is. It's about
the district learning

00:31.000 --> 00:32.458
what an effective school we are,

00:32.458 --> 00:34.667
and what an awesome fucking
principal I am.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.583
-(FART SOUND)
-(STUDENTS LAUGHING)

00:36.583 --> 00:38.250
Ever since spring term started,

00:38.250 --> 00:40.291
we stop teaching
to the tests.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.583
NEAL GAMBY: What the teachers
have done is wrong.

00:42.583 --> 00:43.542
It's a full mutiny.

00:43.542 --> 00:45.458

00:45.458 --> 00:47.417
North Jackson High School,
they're in!

-They're in!

00:50.625 --> 00:51.750
RUSSELL: Christine!

00:52.333 --> 00:53.542
Christine is gone.

00:53.542 --> 00:56.125
Why do all these bad things
keep happening to me?

01:02.583 --> 01:03.875
Where the fuck are they?

01:03.875 --> 01:05.792
Well, Nash said
they'll be here,
so they'll be here.

01:05.792 --> 01:07.291
Heads up!
It's Big Cuckoo,

01:07.291 --> 01:09.041
and I brought
the little birdy with me.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.792
Uh, Nash said
you wanted to see me?

01:10.792 --> 01:11.959
What is this place?

01:11.959 --> 01:14.291
I wanted to thank you for
your help with the HSAPs.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.583
Since certain
enemies of the school
revealed themselves,

01:16.583 --> 01:18.083
I feel that
what we did was right.

01:18.083 --> 01:20.208
And now North Jackson
is back on track.

01:20.208 --> 01:21.625
Now, because those teachers

01:21.625 --> 01:23.125
would eat a baby's dick
to expose us,

01:23.125 --> 01:25.959
we need to take this
to the grave.

01:25.959 --> 01:29.625
Now, I know that
I can trust these two.

01:29.625 --> 01:30.875
Can I trust you, Amanda?

01:30.875 --> 01:33.083
Oh, yeah.
I'm not gonna say
anything to anyone.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.000
(sighs)

01:35.000 --> 01:36.125
Okay.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.000
(sighs, gasps)

01:41.000 --> 01:42.542
Oh, my God.

Oh, um...

01:53.166 --> 01:55.000
Is it-- is it okay
if I don't use that

01:55.000 --> 01:57.375
'cause of the blood
all over it?

01:59.417 --> 02:00.667
Cool. Thanks.

02:00.667 --> 02:01.834
Uh...

02:03.500 --> 02:05.333
Aah... (hisses)

Yup.

Then our blood pact is set.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.875
So, what is everybody
doing for spring break?

02:23.875 --> 02:25.208
I'm heading west
to Sedona.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.375
Hit the spa.
Hm.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.500
This time tomorrow,
I'll be tits-deep in goop.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.125
Both: Hm.
Hm. I hear you're, uh,
going to the beach?

02:31.125 --> 02:34.083
Yeah, I am.
To Isle of Palms
with my daughter.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.875
Not Abbott though.
She's not allowed
to come to the ocean.

02:36.875 --> 02:37.875
Mm.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.125
What about you, Amanda?

02:39.125 --> 02:40.458
Are you doing
something interesting?

02:40.458 --> 02:41.542
Yes, actually.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.041
I'm going to an arts
festival in Asheville.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.542
They invited Brian to read
from his new novel.
Oh.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.166
Nash:
That's quite an honor.

02:47.166 --> 02:50.041
It means a whole weekend
where it's not just you
sucking his meat-stick.

02:50.041 --> 02:51.041
Snodgrass:
Yup.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.750
Should be cool.
Well, great.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.500
That's so great.
I'm so happy to hear
everybody's having such a...

02:55.500 --> 02:57.458
a good, fun time
at spring break.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.583
I'm gonna be home,

02:59.583 --> 03:02.000
alone in my bathrobe,

03:02.000 --> 03:03.500
just being with me.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.166
Just loving on me because...

03:06.166 --> 03:07.542
I'm getting a divorce.

03:07.542 --> 03:09.083
(laughs)

03:10.583 --> 03:12.917
Oh, let's go right here.

03:12.917 --> 03:14.875
This is how I feel
about it.
Gamby: Really?

03:14.875 --> 03:16.583
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.583
Everybody, hands on top.

03:20.041 --> 03:21.750
Happy spring break, y'all!

03:21.750 --> 03:24.041
(theme music playing)

03:33.709 --> 03:36.000
(cheering)
All right, settle down!

03:36.000 --> 03:39.458
Settle down! I'm excited
to get out of here too,
but be civilized.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.500
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.375
Why aren't you wearing
your jean jacket?
I don't know.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.625
After closer looks,
I don't really feel
like it's my style.

03:46.625 --> 03:49.250
We're not gonna see each other
for a whole week. I hate it!

03:49.250 --> 03:50.917
Yeah, it sucks big time.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.417
Yeah.
But like I told you,

03:52.417 --> 03:55.125
you know, going to the beach is
my daughter and I's tradition,

03:55.125 --> 03:56.667
so it's kind of like
a special bonding thing.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.625
Oh, my God, you know what
I just thought of just now?

03:58.625 --> 04:00.959
What?
What if I went
with you guys?

04:00.959 --> 04:04.250
Let's not even think
about that 'cause that's
never gonna happen, okay?

04:04.250 --> 04:06.250
Are you sure
you're not mad at me?

04:06.250 --> 04:07.291
No, I'm fine.

04:07.291 --> 04:09.000
It's just you seem weird,
kind of distant.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.500
I'm not acting weird.
Hey, Sue.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.792
I'm just trying to get
these people out
of here on time.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.291
(sighs)

04:14.291 --> 04:17.291
I have to tell you something.
I'm nervous about it.
Everything okay?

04:17.291 --> 04:19.500
Just don't freak out 'cause
it's actually really beautiful.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.208
Well, I'm gonna freak out
if you don't tell me
what it is. What is it?

04:22.208 --> 04:25.458
Remember that time
when you tried to pull out
and I leg-locked you?

04:26.792 --> 04:27.750
Yeah.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.709
Well, you sneezed inside of me.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.000
I'm pregnant.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.834
What?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.500
Oh, fuck.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.291
Are you fucking serious?

04:39.291 --> 04:40.834
(groans)

04:40.834 --> 04:42.166
No, I'm not really pregnant.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.500
I was trying to trap you.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.000
Fuck, I'm gonna
miss you so much.
What the fuck?

04:51.250 --> 04:52.458
(giggles)

04:52.458 --> 04:54.542
Remind you what I taste like.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.583
I love you.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.375
(alarm blaring)

05:12.542 --> 05:13.750
Shit.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.542
You should have told me
you were comin'.

05:15.542 --> 05:17.583
I would have disabled
my perimeter defenses.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.875
I'm sorry, Gamby.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.500
I just had the ugliest meeting
with Christine and her lawyer.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.333
This will be the loneliest
spring break ever

05:23.333 --> 05:25.583
if I have to be
in that big ol' house
all by myself.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.750
I feel for you, bud.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.667
But I'm not sure
what you want me
to do about it.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.375
(grunts)
(yelps)

05:31.375 --> 05:34.250
I wanna come
on spring break with you.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.083
Oh, man.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.458
I'm sorry, buddy,

05:38.458 --> 05:40.291
but this week is reserved
for me and Janelle.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.917
But you said
she's bringing a friend.

05:42.917 --> 05:44.792
Can't you bring a friend too?

05:44.792 --> 05:47.083
Look, we can-- we can--
we can even take my new Jeep.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.917
I won it in the divorce.

05:48.917 --> 05:52.000
It has leather seats,
satellite radio,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.959
it even has
a motherfucking sunroof!

05:53.959 --> 05:56.083
Cruise to the beach in style.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.208
I mean...

05:58.208 --> 05:59.750
Please?

06:02.083 --> 06:03.083
Gamby:
Cowabunga!

06:03.083 --> 06:04.834
Who's ready
to hang 10

06:04.834 --> 06:06.125
at the beach?
Surprise.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.750
Yo, Neal, we were just gabbing
with your lady-friend here.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.041
What the fuck
are you doing here?
Abbott: Got you some

06:11.041 --> 06:12.750
homemade sugar browns
here for your trip.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.000
That's nice.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.083
What? I'm sorry,
did you not invite Jen

06:16.083 --> 06:17.458
to come with you
on the beach trip?

06:17.458 --> 06:18.750
No, no, no, Gale.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.750
I never ever thought
that was part of this.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.542
I know this trip
is about Neal

06:22.542 --> 06:24.125
having quality time
with Janelle,

06:24.125 --> 06:27.875
and I would never ever want
to be in the way of that.
Aww.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.750
(whispers) Let's kiss
in front of your family.
Gale: That's really nice.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.417
Uh, Janelle, hey, cool.
Time to go bye-bye.

06:33.417 --> 06:35.125
Deb and Beth are
still getting changed.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.667
Hey, baby,
did you pack your sunscreen?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.500
Because you don't tan,
you know, you burn.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.709
Whatever, Mom.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.625
Can you just stop acting
like you know everything?

06:41.625 --> 06:44.250
Ooh! She's cocksure
like her father.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.667
It's gonna be fun raising her.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.583
She's just showing off
in front of her friends.

06:47.583 --> 06:50.458
Hey, Deb, Deb's the one
you gotta watch out for.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.625
She acts different around Deb.

06:51.625 --> 06:52.792
Mean.
Yeah.

06:52.792 --> 06:55.542
Oh, maybe you do need me
going along on this trip.

06:55.542 --> 06:56.875
Do you mind
if we step outside

06:56.875 --> 06:59.375
so we can have
a chit-chat in privacy?

07:02.208 --> 07:04.000
You don't seem
happy to see me.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.208
Well, that's
because I'm not.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.583
I am on a very tight schedule

07:06.583 --> 07:07.959
if I want to make
the most of this trip.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.875
How the hell did you even
know where they live?

07:09.875 --> 07:13.500
When we first started going out,
I might have tailed you once.
Jesus!

07:13.500 --> 07:15.333
Do you know
how super-psycho that sounds?

07:15.333 --> 07:16.792
Whose Jeep is that?

07:18.083 --> 07:20.125
That's my Jeep.
It's a rental-- rental Jeep.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.667
Look, let's go back
inside the house now and--

07:21.667 --> 07:23.000
Is that Lee Russell
sitting in there?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.333
No. Don't pay
attention to that.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.500
Go back in
the fucking house right now!
What the fuck, Neal?

07:26.500 --> 07:27.875
Is he going with you?

07:27.875 --> 07:29.125
Open your window.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.041
Open it!
Calm down, fuck-face.

07:31.041 --> 07:33.667
Are you going
on spring break?
Yes, I am.

07:34.959 --> 07:36.375
It was a last-minute
thing, okay?

07:36.375 --> 07:38.333
He's going through a divorce.
He was being a good friend!

07:38.333 --> 07:40.500
So, this fucking psycho--
You're a psycho!

07:40.500 --> 07:42.375
No, no, no,
you're a fucking psycho!
You're a psycho!

07:42.375 --> 07:43.500
Gamby: Guys!
Oh no.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.458
He can go
on spring break
but I can't?

07:45.458 --> 07:47.208
That's some bullshit, Neal.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.625
That is 100%
Oh!

07:48.625 --> 07:50.083
total fucking bullshit!
Stop that.

07:50.083 --> 07:53.000
Knock that shit off.
What? That's so fucked up!

07:53.000 --> 07:54.834
Fuck those sugar browns!

07:54.834 --> 07:57.709
(grunts)
Gamby: Are you done?

07:57.709 --> 07:59.500
Are you done spazzing out?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.250
(panting)
Yes.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.208
Okay, girls, it's okay.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.458
Bring your luggage.
She's done.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.750
Come on.
Let's do it.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.542
Hey, Ray! Hey, Janelle!
Clean up these brownie things.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.875
Hey, Uncle Lee.
Okay? Ray works very hard
on this lawn.

Russell: Hey! (kisses)
Oh, it's so good to see you.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.375
These are your friends?
Yeah, sure.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.250

to spell it for me.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.709
(shutter clicks)
I can't wait
for your reading.

08:37.709 --> 08:39.417
You're gonna come
of course, aren't you?

08:39.417 --> 08:41.250
I absolutely wouldn't miss it.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.792
We'll make sure
we get you a good seat.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.583
These are gold passes.

08:44.583 --> 08:48.125
Wonderful.
They will admit you to all
of the events at the festival,

08:48.125 --> 08:50.083
and tonight
we have a reservation
at Jason's Steakhouse

08:50.083 --> 08:53.125
Ooh, Jason's.
for you and the other
writers being honored.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.250
Wow. Do you eat meat?

08:54.250 --> 08:55.792
I would.

08:55.792 --> 08:56.917
Nice.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.291
(shutter clicks)
VIP treatment.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.291
Thank you so much
for your help...
Come on, sweetheart.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.709
...and we'll see you soon.
Let's go.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.834
After you, my friend.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.125
Oh. Merci beaucoup.
Yes.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.083
And, uh, afternoon.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.625
Ooh! Janelle,
Ohio plates!

09:10.625 --> 09:12.041
That's another
point for me!

09:12.041 --> 09:13.792
Man, I'm beating you
like a million to zip.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.792
Fine, you win.
Can we stop now?

09:15.792 --> 09:17.500
Russell: Ooh.
"Can we stop now"?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.667
Is that the kind
of tone you want
to use with your father?

09:19.667 --> 09:20.917
(text message whoosh)

09:20.917 --> 09:22.291
(phone chimes)
(giggles)

09:22.291 --> 09:24.375
(phones ding, vibrate)
(girls gasp)

09:24.375 --> 09:25.500
(all laugh)

09:25.500 --> 09:27.458
(laughter continues)

09:27.458 --> 09:29.000
So what's the plan
for girl time?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.542
You guys gonna do
some camp pranks?

09:30.542 --> 09:32.959
Camp pranks? Um, no.
(text message whoosh)

09:32.959 --> 09:35.375
You know, me and my friends,
when we were young, whew.
(phone chimes)

09:35.375 --> 09:37.166
We'd get together,
if one of us fell asleep

09:37.166 --> 09:39.500
before the others,
we'd put their hand
in warm water,

09:39.500 --> 09:40.792
make 'em pee themselves.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.166
(both laugh)
I love that one!
That one's classic!

09:43.166 --> 09:44.542
Try to make
each other pee?

09:44.542 --> 09:45.667
Why would you want
to do that?

09:45.667 --> 09:46.917
'Cause it's
embarrassing to pee.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.875
It's embarrassing
for the person
trying to do that.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.083
(typing sounds)

09:50.083 --> 09:51.333
It's disgusting.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.834
We are a carload
of teenage girls
heading to the beach.

09:53.834 --> 09:56.417
It's going to get disgusting.

I just finished
Snodgrass' book.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.375
Good?
Oh, it's incredible.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.458
I've never read anything
like this before.
Really?

11:04.458 --> 11:05.875
I'm not one
for reading books,

11:05.875 --> 11:08.333
but this, this is
a fantastic tale.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.709
Gamby, Gamby, Gamby.

11:09.709 --> 11:10.917
Why are you with Abbott

11:10.917 --> 11:12.834
if you're in love
with Snodgrass? Tell me.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.834
Snodgrass is with Brian.

11:14.834 --> 11:17.125
Yeah, but Abbott?
I mean, you hate her.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.709
(sighs)
Freak.

11:18.709 --> 11:19.709
I know.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.291
Look, I know you're
going through a divorce,

11:21.291 --> 11:22.750
so I don't want you
to get in your head,

11:22.750 --> 11:24.667
but being single
sucks, Russell.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.000
The lonely nights,
the-- the fear,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.709
the-- the fruitless
masturbation, it's--
it's terrible.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.959
Having a shitty girlfriend
like Jen Abbott's better

11:31.959 --> 11:33.709
than being all alone.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.250
Thanks a lot.

11:36.250 --> 11:39.333
God, you really know how
to make a person feel good. God.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.750
What the fuck? Uh-uh!

11:40.750 --> 11:42.375
No, no. Deb?

11:42.375 --> 11:44.375
What in the... (mouths)
are you wearing right now?

11:44.375 --> 11:46.417
What? It's just a bathing suit.
A bathing suit?

11:46.417 --> 11:48.917
That covers less
than underpanties do.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.041
This is the style.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.625
She's right.
It's called a Brazilian.

11:51.625 --> 11:54.959
It's very popular with all
the teenagers now. Cheers.

11:54.959 --> 11:58.041
Yeah, they are.
Like, I totally want
a Brazilian.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.083
Deb: Yeah.
(scoffs) Well,

11:59.083 --> 12:01.125
you're not getting
a Brazilian, Janelle.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.583
Trust me, all right?

12:02.583 --> 12:04.834
You wear a damn size 16 jeans,
for Christ's sake.
(Russell laughs)

12:04.834 --> 12:06.959
Deb:
Janelle's lost
six pounds since Christmas,

12:06.959 --> 12:08.083
in case you hadn't noticed.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.917
Beth, come on.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.083
Oh, what, now
she's pissed at me?

12:12.083 --> 12:14.417
What a crock of shit.
Totally.

12:14.417 --> 12:17.500
There's no way in hell
Janelle's lost six pounds.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.250
A toast to being
fascinating! Cheers!

12:20.250 --> 12:21.500
To being fascinating.
Cheers.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.709
We are all
fascinating creatures.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.083
So, Amanda, are you--
are you a writer too?

12:26.083 --> 12:28.125
Um, mm...

12:29.250 --> 12:31.208
Sorry, one second. (laughs)

12:31.208 --> 12:32.917
I am a writer. Mm...

12:32.917 --> 12:35.625
(mumbling)
I'm just working
on a Y novel currently.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.333
Y-A novel.
Man: Oh.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.333
Yup. And, uh, uh...

12:39.333 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.
(coughs)

12:41.000 --> 12:42.500
Uh...
You all right?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
Ooh.
Yup.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.125
I just got back
my first batch of notes

12:45.125 --> 12:46.208
from the publisher.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.000
They want all
these changes, but, um,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.291
I suppose I'm afraid

12:49.291 --> 12:51.667
that my voice is
going to get lost.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.667
Your voice,
that's cute.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.083
Amanda is under the assumption

12:55.083 --> 12:57.000
that her work is
perfect as is.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.083
(both chuckle)

12:58.083 --> 13:00.166
Nope. No--
Yup.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.667
(laughs)
Not at all.

13:01.667 --> 13:04.083
I'm just not sure about all
of their suggestions, Brian.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.750
Man:
Oh, you don't feel it
in your guts,

13:05.750 --> 13:08.041
I say fuck the notes.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.291
Woman:
He's right.

13:09.291 --> 13:11.333
Publishers don't know
what they're talking about.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.375
Snodgrass: Really?
No.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.041
See, I've been told otherwise.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.041
Well, I think
that all depends

13:16.041 --> 13:18.834
on the book
and on the writer.

13:18.834 --> 13:19.834
Trust me.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.000
Stick to your guns.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.709
To sticking to your guns...

13:23.709 --> 13:25.125
sticky buns.

13:25.125 --> 13:26.625
(laughter)

13:26.625 --> 13:29.709
I've just come up
with the title for my new book.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.709
I can remember
when Janelle would let me

13:31.709 --> 13:32.875
hold her hand
on the boardwalk.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.208
She's acting so different.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.083
Oh, come on.
She's just trying
to impress Deb.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.959
She's a real
queen bee, that one.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.291
Yeah, 'B' for bitch.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.959
She's got Janelle acting
all mean and teenager-y.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.041
Russell:
Well, she's definitely
advanced for her age.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.208
Look at the shape
of that ass.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.959
You could break
a boy's heart on that.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.333
Russell, she's 14 years old.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.875
Like I said,
she's advanced for her age.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.959
Well, I don't want
her advancing my daughter.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.917
Seems to me that
somebody needs to take

13:53.917 --> 13:56.250
bitch-ass Deb
down a peg.

13:56.250 --> 14:00.417
♪ ♪

14:13.542 --> 14:16.125
Sssss!

14:16.125 --> 14:18.083
Sss! Sss!
Shh, shh, shh.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.083
(screams)

14:22.083 --> 14:24.250
Something hot
just spilled on me!
What the fuck?

14:24.250 --> 14:26.125
Dad, what are you doing?
Gamby: Nothing!

14:26.125 --> 14:27.792
I was bringing you
drinks to have.

14:27.792 --> 14:30.000
Why were you crouching
in the dark by Deb's bed?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.291
Deb:
Oh, my God!

14:31.291 --> 14:32.375
You were doing
your pee prank!

14:32.375 --> 14:34.250
Uh, no! Gross!
That's piss! No way!

14:34.250 --> 14:35.667
You could go
to jail for this!

14:35.667 --> 14:37.750
I-- I can explain.
It was Russell
and myself, we're--

14:37.750 --> 14:39.542
Russell?
Dad.

14:39.542 --> 14:40.959
Get out of our room!

14:40.959 --> 14:42.500
Yeah, sure.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.959
(door closes)
(groans)

14:45.959 --> 14:48.625
So, your colleagues
didn't think I needed

14:48.625 --> 14:50.625
to take all
of those notes.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.041
Well, those people
are real authors.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.834
I mean, maybe they don't need
to take all those notes.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.125
What, am I a fake author?
No, no.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.125
Don't put words
into my mouth.
No--

15:00.125 --> 15:01.458
Yes, you are.
I'm not-- I'm not--

15:01.458 --> 15:02.792
I'm just talking with you.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.000
Brian,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.625
do you think
that my book sucks?

15:05.625 --> 15:07.041
Don't do this.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.083
What?

15:08.083 --> 15:10.583
I just-- I would like
your honest opinion.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.792
It-- it matters to me.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.125
Okay.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.875
I think your book
could use some work.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.041
And?
You're-- you're forcing
my hand here.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.375
I am. Come on.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.166
Okay.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.542
I think your book
is derivative of every book

15:25.542 --> 15:28.166
that's ever been written
for the YA marketplace.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.166
It's not very engaging,

15:30.166 --> 15:31.667
none of it
is very original,

15:31.667 --> 15:33.417
it's way too long.

15:33.417 --> 15:35.125
It's not my cup of tea.

15:37.625 --> 15:38.959
Uh...

15:38.959 --> 15:42.917
Brian, why on Earth did you
send it to your publisher?

15:42.917 --> 15:45.500
Come on, do I really
have to answer that question?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.834
Hm?
Yes, please.

15:48.709 --> 15:51.041
A middle-aged man
like me needs to use

15:51.041 --> 15:54.000
all the bait that's left
in his tackle box to lure

15:54.000 --> 15:55.542
a beautiful girl like you,

15:55.542 --> 15:58.375
so of course I'm gonna help you
when you're asking me.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.875
And I do really think
you're talented.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.041
But you hate my book.
Listen.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.709
You need a thick skin
in this business, okay?

16:06.709 --> 16:08.125
I got a bad review once.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.417
Buck up.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.000
I'll buy you an ice cream.

16:12.709 --> 16:14.166
Janelle, do you
remember this place?

16:14.166 --> 16:16.041
Did you tell your friends
about the slider challenge?

16:16.041 --> 16:19.125
Dad, they don't want to hear
about me eating stupid sliders.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.959
It wasn't stupid
when you ate 25 sliders

16:20.959 --> 16:23.041
in five minutes and got our
whole entire meal comped.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.208
(laughs)
Bet your picture's
still up on the wall.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.667
Mm, that's weird.
I could have sworn

16:28.667 --> 16:30.834
your photo used to be here
by those two homosexuals.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.417
Dad, who cares?

16:32.417 --> 16:34.834
I care.

16:34.834 --> 16:37.083
Sir, are you the manager?
That's right.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.083
My daughter Janelle,
she completed the burger
challenge five years ago.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.375
She got her picture
up on the wall,

16:41.375 --> 16:43.083
but we-- we can't seem
to find it out there.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.792
Oh, the older photos,
they come down sometimes

16:44.792 --> 16:46.500
so we can make room
for the new pictures.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.625
