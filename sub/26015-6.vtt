do something easy?

start sketching another part.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.499
<i>Then you get</i>
<i>to the little guy above him.</i>

18:03.582 --> 18:06.502
He's the next
closest thing to see detail.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.296
<i>And that guy looks</i>
<i>completely out of focus.</i>

18:09.379 --> 18:12.341
<i>There's not just a cloak</i>
<i>effect and the pants look like</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:14.468
<i>the wall minus</i>
<i>the lines of the brick.</i>

18:14.551 --> 18:18.180
<i>Everything about that guy</i>
<i>isn't keeping up with the guy</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:21.475
in the front. So, therefore,
the design looks disjointed.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.226
Now you have this dragon.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.353
<i>The dragon is massive.</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:27.523
<i>It's shaded nice, it's strong,</i>
<i>everything's colored.</i>

18:27.606 --> 18:29.858
Then you have this little
tiny brick house behind it.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.195
<i>The dragon is so [bleep] big</i>
<i>and it's just disappearing</i>

18:33.278 --> 18:34.822
<i>behind that tiny</i>
<i>little brick house.</i>

18:34.905 --> 18:37.324
<i>There's no play back</i>
<i>into itself, no kind of ties.</i>

18:37.407 --> 18:40.035
<i>No two images</i>
<i>tie into each other.</i>

18:40.118 --> 18:41.912
It looks like
standalone tattoos.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.790
For as creative as a team as

18:44.873 --> 18:47.376
you guys are,
artistically as a unit,

18:47.459 --> 18:49.419
I don't think you
guys fired well at all.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.629
- As soon as we
found out we were doing

18:50.712 --> 18:53.590
a collaborative tattoo,
I genuinely thought that

18:53.674 --> 18:55.300
we had a greater bridge to gap.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.095
I think that four members
of Team Christian could all do

18:58.178 --> 18:59.847
the same tattoo,
and you'd be hard pressed

18:59.930 --> 19:02.307
to know who did which one.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.226
And I think we all
tattoo so vastly different.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.978
- You don't have
four color traditional guys

19:06.061 --> 19:07.396
that could all match up pieces?

19:07.479 --> 19:09.314
- Did anyone do any
traditional tattoo out there?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.482
- But I was just trying to say

19:10.566 --> 19:11.859
that that's how I
felt going into it.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.402
I didn't need the [bleep]
two cents from Christian;

19:13.485 --> 19:15.153
I'm just telling you how--
- Well, you got it.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.989
Don't separate the teams
by saying that, you know--

19:17.072 --> 19:18.240
- I'm not separating
anybody's [bleep].

19:18.323 --> 19:20.075
- It's called "terminal
uniqueness" in therapy.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.244
- I came here as one
mother[bleep] to tattoo.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.580
I know it's teams,
but I like to do things my way.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.375
- Being able to break out of
that is what we're looking for,

19:28.458 --> 19:30.961
which is adaptability.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.589
I'll say that both teams swung
for the fences, and it's got

19:33.672 --> 19:37.050
to be a hard challenge.
All right, guys, thank you.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.515
All right, guys,
it is now time to determine who

19:43.599 --> 19:44.850
had the best tattoo of the day.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.935
{\an8}<i>- Technically,</i>
<i>I think there's a lot of great</i>

19:47.019 --> 19:48.145
{\an8}<i>work in Team Cleen's,</i>

19:48.228 --> 19:49.938
{\an8}<i>but overall hitting</i>
<i>this challenge,</i>

19:50.022 --> 19:53.025
{\an8}<i>the scene, the consistency,</i>
<i>the adaptability looks really</i>

19:53.108 --> 19:54.026
{\an8}<i>stronger for Team Christian.</i>

19:54.109 --> 19:55.611
My vote's for Team Christian.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.279
- There's no debate for me.

19:57.362 --> 20:01.617
I'm going with Team Christian.
- Yes. Boom.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.329
- The judges have decided,
the best tattoo of the day goes

20:05.412 --> 20:06.872
to Team Christian.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.458
You are all
safe from elimination.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.251
- Another day.

20:11.335 --> 20:16.798
- That means, Team Cleen,
one of you is going home.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.967
Cleen, your team
lost the battle today.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.386
But you haven't lost the war.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.680
To take down your opponent
in the final grudge match,

20:23.764 --> 20:28.143
you must eliminate the weak to
keep the strongest team behind.

20:28.226 --> 20:30.270
And as a coach,
you know better than anyone who

20:30.354 --> 20:32.856
on your team is the weakest.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.818
Today,
the power is in your hands.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.696
- Ooh,
[bleep].

20:39.780 --> 20:43.033
- You alone must decide
which two artists from your

20:43.116 --> 20:46.328
team are the weakest, and put
them up for elimination.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.377
- Nobody wants to be
in your seat right now, buddy.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.171
- This isn't personal.
This is business.

20:56.254 --> 20:57.547
Protect who you need to protect
to get you to the end,

20:57.631 --> 21:01.426
and the people who haven't
shined yet, it's up to them.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.261
One of them gets to stay,
one of them has to go.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.515
- Head back to the loft.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.101
You have a very
important decision to make.

It's pretty obvious that
everybody's kind of pointing

23:03.090 --> 23:04.633
the finger at Austin and Stacy.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.844
- For a team that seems to be
falling apart from my end,

23:07.928 --> 23:11.306
{\an3}they kind of seem to be one
of your strongest team players.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.433
- Well,
I'm not gonna deny that.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.893

of any of the things
that people tell us to do.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.563
- Right. And right now,
your team doesn't work

23:18.647 --> 23:20.232
well together because there are

23:20.315 --> 23:23.318
{\an1}people on your team
that do nothing but butt heads.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.028
These are your two workhorses

23:32.953 --> 23:34.413
you need to know who

Part of my negativity
yesterday going into that

was negative from the get-go.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.230
Kyle's emotional.
- He's an emotional wreck,

24:00.313 --> 24:03.191
but then on top of that,
he won tattoo of the day.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.693
- We're juggling
technical application

24:04.776 --> 24:06.194

24:06.278 --> 24:09.239
{\an3}- Who are gonna help our

24:09.322 --> 24:11.199

because I think technically,

24:11.283 --> 24:14.369
Austin and Stacy
are the weaker links.

24:14.452 --> 24:16.246
{\an3}But they both listen,
and they both want to help.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.540
And I think that's an advantage

24:18.623 --> 24:20.625
{\an3}as far as them
contributing to the team.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.003
- I think Kyle and Stacy
are neck and neck for me.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.046
Because even though
she was bringing good energy,

24:25.130 --> 24:28.508
we still need a good tattoo.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.801
Turk's been in the bottom

34:53.382 --> 34:55.134
- So, if Austin comes back up,

34:55.217 --> 34:56.469
{\an3}did he come back up
because he pulled it off?

34:56.552 --> 34:59.305
{\an3}Or did he come back up
because we got him through it?

34:59.388 --> 35:02.809
{\an3}I don't think we actually know
who can do a better tattoo.

35:08.981 --> 35:15.154
<i>♪ ♪</i>

35:17.448 --> 35:20.409
- Austin and Stacy, today
you had to battle head to head

35:20.493 --> 35:22.370
to stay in this competition.

35:22.453 --> 35:26.123
Based on your work, one of you
will be packing your machines.

35:26.207 --> 35:26.582
Let's see how you did.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.377
Austin.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.422
- I like the shape,
I like the design.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.217
<i>The details of the actual</i>
<i>skull itself are really cool.</i>

35:36.300 --> 35:37.468
<i>The shape of the eyes,</i>
<i>the nose, and the mouth,</i>

35:37.552 --> 35:40.680
<i>they really tell</i>
<i>the skull part of the story.</i>

35:40.763 --> 35:41.973
- I do like
the appeal of this tattoo.

35:42.056 --> 35:43.724
<i>I like the color</i>
<i>play quite a bit.</i>

35:43.808 --> 35:44.767
<i>Using the hot and cold color</i>

35:44.851 --> 35:46.853
palette like you
did was a smart play.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.355
- The biggest missed
opportunity in this tattoo

35:49.438 --> 35:51.524
<i>is putting some</i>
<i>heavy areas of black.</i>

35:51.607 --> 35:53.901
<i>These deep-set areas,</i>
<i>instead of going from a light</i>

35:53.985 --> 35:57.822
<i>grey to the color, to go</i>
<i>from solid black to the color,</i>

35:57.905 --> 35:59.907
<i>to really show the dimension</i>
<i>of these pieces taking shape.</i>

35:59.991 --> 36:02.743
As far as the biomech part,

36:02.827 --> 36:05.371
<i>I do wish it had</i>
<i>more of the bio feel.</i>

36:05.454 --> 36:06.581
- It looks very stiff.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.916
<i>The biomechanical</i>
<i>aspect became</i>

36:09.000 --> 36:12.253
<i>a beveled, hard</i>
<i>kind of shaped image.</i>

36:12.336 --> 36:15.298
It doesn't have a lot
of that real bio-feel to it.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.549
More like alienesque.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.426
- I went more
mechanical for sure.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.720
<i>- This tattoo has an appealing</i>
<i>look to it at first glance.</i>

36:20.803 --> 36:22.930
I just don't look at it
as a confident tattoo in really

36:23.014 --> 36:25.975
understanding biomechanics.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.563
- Stacy.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.441
You really swung for the fences
here with this design.

36:33.524 --> 36:36.402
<i>You did try to show us</i>
<i>some organic elements</i>

36:36.485 --> 36:37.737
<i>in this piece.</i>

36:37.820 --> 36:38.988
<i>Certainly with some</i>
<i>of the detailing you put</i>

36:39.071 --> 36:40.615
<i>in the spikes,</i>
<i>in the center of the nose,</i>

36:40.698 --> 36:44.035
<i>under the eye socket with</i>
<i>the repetitive bone pattern.</i>

36:44.118 --> 36:45.328
<i>It looks like there is more</i>

36:45.411 --> 36:47.622
of an organic bio
feel happening here.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.540
- It was interesting
to step out of my comfort zone

36:49.624 --> 36:53.461
and definitely try something I
never even thought I would try.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.546
- For me, you do better
in bio than you do in a skull.

36:55.630 --> 36:59.467
From the nose down, it just
looks like somebody went, pff,

36:59.550 --> 37:02.011
with putty, and just smeared
this thing down, and then it's

37:02.094 --> 37:03.554
<i>got a perfect set of veneers.</i>

37:03.638 --> 37:04.972
<i>It's all gnarly everywhere,</i>

37:05.056 --> 37:06.891
<i>then he's got these</i>
<i>pretty little choppers.</i>

37:06.974 --> 37:08.017
Doesn't flow.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.270
- Just the dynamics
of the skull itself look

37:11.354 --> 37:13.814
<i>really lackluster.</i>
<i>But you have a lot more</i>

37:13.898 --> 37:16.150
<i>interesting</i>
<i>texture in your pieces.</i>

37:16.233 --> 37:16.984
<i>You have multiple colors,</i>
<i>multiple tones.</i>

37:17.068 --> 37:19.820
<i>It does have a bony texture.</i>

37:19.904 --> 37:21.489
<i>It doesn't just look like</i>
<i>a piece of metal</i>

37:21.572 --> 37:23.032
<i>I cut on a jigsaw.</i>

37:23.115 --> 37:25.993
<i>It actually looks like</i>
<i>a bone that grew into a shape.</i>

37:26.077 --> 37:29.956
I really think you have some
shining moments in this tattoo.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.584
- Good. You did good.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.796
- Cleen, you had to put
these two up for elimination.

37:36.879 --> 37:37.964
This is your team.
How you feeling about this?

37:38.047 --> 37:40.174
- I mean, it sucks.

37:40.257 --> 37:42.051
Obviously I want
the best tattooer on the team.

37:42.134 --> 37:45.221
{\an8}I think the tattoos
both have some good qualities.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.598
{\an8}<i>Stacy's, I think,</i>
<i>looks a little cleaner, and I</i>

37:47.682 --> 37:49.350
{\an8}didn't really help her do much.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.770
<i>Austin, the outline's a little</i>
<i>wonky from top to bottom,</i>

37:52.853 --> 37:55.773
and yeah, I mean,
everybody chimed in way more

37:55.856 --> 37:58.943
on Austin's, and to get
to this point right now.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.611
{\an1}- Stacy definitely had
a better plan going into it.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.531
She had this color rendering.
She followed it step by step.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.534
- If we're looking at
it from a team perspective,

38:06.617 --> 38:10.329
we had to spoon-feed a lot
of what Austin did to Austin.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.581
- They helped me out a lot,
and I'm not gonna deny that one

38:12.665 --> 38:13.791
[bleep] bit.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.334
- We are still
in the competition as well.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.752
{\an1}If this was a tattoo
challenge where we were

38:16.836 --> 38:19.046
{\an1}all having to tattoo,
then a lot of our energy might

38:19.130 --> 38:21.340
{\an1}have been exasperated
helping one individual,

38:21.424 --> 38:23.300
which could ultimately
take away from ourselves.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.219
- Austin,
did you not have a plan?

38:25.302 --> 38:26.804
- I had somewhat of a plan.

38:26.887 --> 38:29.056
I ended up changing my color
palette, like, because I had--

38:29.140 --> 38:30.766
I should've drawn this
on paper.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.060
- Being prepared to do any
work in your life is the key

38:33.144 --> 38:34.979
to succeeding at
the work you do.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.315
You can't just come in without

38:37.398 --> 38:39.025
having yourself
ready for that job.

38:39.108 --> 38:41.736
- I've wasted my last few years

38:41.819 --> 38:44.739
trying to get my life together
and not following my tattooing.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.365
Just being here, I'm realizing

38:46.449 --> 38:48.701
I needed to put a little bit
more of that into my tattooing.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.703
It's been, you know,
it's been neglected the last

38:50.786 --> 38:52.747
couple of years, and it
[bleep] shows.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.206
- Hey, man, if you're trying

38:54.290 --> 38:55.624
to get your life together,
you're not wasting anything.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.085
Because the first thing you
need is your life to tattoo.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.587
First, you fix your life.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.965
Then you fix the things that
are in your life, one by one.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.510
- All right, guys. Time
to decide who's going home.

39:06.594 --> 39:10.264
{\an8}I see shining moments in both,
and I see deficiencies in both,

39:10.347 --> 39:13.225
{\an8}<i>but I mean, I think that</i>
<i>Stacy hit more of the biomech.</i>

39:13.309 --> 39:14.852
{\an8}- Remember that it's
not a biomech challenge,

39:14.935 --> 39:16.729
it's a biomech skull challenge.

39:16.812 --> 39:17.438
- When you're
gonna do a biomech skull,

39:17.521 --> 39:19.565
what do you do first?

39:19.648 --> 39:21.609
Start with the skull.
Look at Austin's.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.944
<i>He looks like he started with</i>
<i>the skull and added to it.</i>

39:24.028 --> 39:26.947
<i>The skull of Stacy's, there's</i>
<i>things that don't make sense</i>

39:27.031 --> 39:28.157
<i>where they're coming from.</i>

39:28.240 --> 39:30.409
- Oliver, your vote to go home.

39:32.870 --> 39:33.829
- My vote is for Stacy.

39:37.041 --> 39:37.375
- Stacy.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.463
- The judges have decided.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.800
Stacy, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.468
Stacy, I have tremendous
amount of respect for you,

39:47.551 --> 39:50.346
and for anybody who
steps into this arena.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.555
But I think that you have done

39:51.639 --> 39:53.808
amazing in terms
of showing us progress.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.019
So, stay on that trajectory.
- Yeah. Thank you guys.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.813
I really appreciate it.
- You did good, kid.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.481
- Thanks, coach.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.483
- Please pack your
machines and close shop.

40:07.321 --> 40:10.324
- Getting eliminated definitely
sucks, but I still have tried

40:10.407 --> 40:12.409
my best on everything
that was thrown at me.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.120
<i>I was really scared coming</i>
