00:01.041 --> 00:03.000
(J.D.)
<i>In some ways, Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso</i>

00:03.083 --> 00:05.166
<i>are a lot like an old,</i>
<i>married couple.</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.041
I need your opinion
about something.

00:07.125 --> 00:10.417
Yes, Bob, those pants do make
you look like you're holding water.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.333
Perry, I'll tell you the same thing
I told a comic I once saw

00:13.417 --> 00:16.041
at a strip club in Reno:
I'm not here for the jokes.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.417
Color me intrigued, Bob.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.417
I am considering
offering full-body scans

00:20.500 --> 00:21.959
here at Sacred Heart.
What do you think?

00:22.041 --> 00:24.542
I think showing
perfectly healthy people

00:24.625 --> 00:27.083
every harmless imperfection
in their body

00:27.166 --> 00:30.750
just to scare them into taking
invasive and often pointless tests

00:30.834 --> 00:33.291
is an unholy sin.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.792
Does sound a little sketchy
ethically, doesn't it?

00:35.875 --> 00:37.208
Thanks, Perry.

00:39.834 --> 00:42.375
Did that just happen?

00:42.458 --> 00:43.417
Anybody?

00:43.500 --> 00:46.375
(J.D.) <i>Me, I was stuck</i>
<i>at a couples-only dinner party.</i>

00:46.458 --> 00:49.291
<i>There was</i>
<i>the soon-to-be newlyweds,</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:53.000
<i>there was the girl that I loved</i>
<i>and the guy trying to eat her face</i>

00:53.083 --> 00:55.250
<i>and then there's Danni and me.</i>

00:55.333 --> 00:58.333
-You know what I was thinking?
-Nobody cares, Danni.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.458
(Carla) Aw, this has been fun,

00:59.542 --> 01:01.458
but I have to drive Turk
back to the hospital.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.417
Yeah, and I gotta get up early
and look for an apartment.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.250
Yeah, he wouldn't take
this perfect one he saw today

01:05.333 --> 01:06.583
just 'cause
the last tenant died there.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.291
Elliot, rats ate his tongue out.

01:08.375 --> 01:11.166
-Yeah, but the kitchen was so cute!
-Oh, please.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.375
Hey, Turk.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.041
Where are you guys gonna live
after you get married?

01:14.125 --> 01:16.625
-You mean where are you gonna live.
-Baby, not now.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.875
Don't know yet.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.083
It's just the two of us.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.709
You wanna have sex?

01:25.458 --> 01:26.709
I guess.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.750
-Do I have to look at you?
-You don't.

01:29.834 --> 01:31.375
Shut up.

01:33.834 --> 01:37.417
I can't believe Kelso really asked
my opinion, you know?

01:37.500 --> 01:39.208
Look, pal,
if I wanted to sit and listen

01:39.291 --> 01:41.250
to someone yammer
on about their lives,

01:41.333 --> 01:43.250
I'd be at my A.A. meeting right now.

01:43.333 --> 01:44.583
Listen there, scrub brush,

01:44.667 --> 01:47.083
it just so happens it was the only
empty seat in the whole joint,

01:47.166 --> 01:49.458
and besides,
as a fellow abusive drinker,

01:49.542 --> 01:51.667
you are honor-bound
by bar-stool protocol

01:51.750 --> 01:54.125
to listen to every last word
out of my mouth.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.834
-Go.
-Kelso...

01:57.709 --> 02:02.000
Kelso really listened to me about
this whole full-body scan thing.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.709
I was thinking about
getting one of those scans.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.291
What did he say?

02:06.375 --> 02:09.667
(little girl, sadly) <i>Mommy,</i>
<i>when's daddy coming home?</i>

02:09.750 --> 02:11.208
<i>He isn't.</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:16.500
<i>If only he'd loved us enough to get</i>
<i>a full-body scan at Sacred Heart.</i>

02:16.583 --> 02:19.041
-(crying)
-(crying)

02:19.125 --> 02:20.625
Holly cow.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.417
Black label.

02:40.709 --> 02:41.959
Oh, my goodness,

02:42.041 --> 02:43.917
I totally kicked that Hernia's ass!

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Nicely done as usual,
Dr. Turk.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.709
(chuckles) Dude...

02:49.417 --> 02:51.417
why is hot doc
being so nice to you lately?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.166
I don't know, but it's about time.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.333
I haven't had to work this hard to
win someone over since Carla's mom.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.000
I thought Carla's mom hated you.

02:58.083 --> 03:01.125
Yeah, but she died,
so I'm counting' that as a win.

03:01.208 --> 03:04.000
I bought a killer dress
for your wedding yesterday.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.000
Ooh, speaking of which,
it's only 2 weeks away.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.291
Has your bride-to-be started
freaking out yet?

03:09.375 --> 03:12.000
Oh, Carla's not
the freak-out type.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.083
(laughs)

03:13.166 --> 03:15.458
(J.D.) <i>Turk didn't realize</i>
<i>that everyone has their moments</i>

03:15.542 --> 03:16.458
<i>when emotions run high.</i>

03:16.542 --> 03:18.166
(knocking)

03:18.250 --> 03:19.500
Turk!

03:19.583 --> 03:22.125
Kelso!

03:22.208 --> 03:23.959
Oh, Danny!

03:24.041 --> 03:25.709
-Turk!
-Kelso!

03:26.667 --> 03:28.000
-Danni.
-Turk!

03:28.083 --> 03:29.667
-Carla?
-Not here.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.542
Danni.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.875
I'm gonna go put some clothes on.
After all, I am a lady.

03:34.959 --> 03:37.542
Oh, by the way, I used your razor
to shave my pits.

03:37.625 --> 03:38.458
Keep it.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.333
(whispering) Dude, Danni did
the weirdest thing last night.

03:40.417 --> 03:41.792
She called out
her own name during sex.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.458
That is weird.
Why are we whispering?

03:43.542 --> 03:44.667
Because she hears like a bat.

03:44.750 --> 03:45.792
Bats hear really well?

03:45.875 --> 03:46.834
Yeah. They can't see.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.375
Oh, yeah, that's right. Sonar.
Wait a second. That's whales.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.583
No, no, no. Bats and whales.
Bats and whales.

03:51.667 --> 03:52.667
Ok, ok, ok.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.000
Anyway, I have to
break up with her.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.166
(J.D.)
<i>Ok, let her down easy.</i>

03:57.333 --> 03:59.291
Danni, I'm not sure
how to do this,

03:59.375 --> 04:02.083
but I just don't think we should
see each other anymore.

04:02.166 --> 04:05.291
Cool. I'm already kind of sleeping
with this guy named Danny anyway.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.083
(whispering) Whoa.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.959
I guess she wasn't calling out
her own name after all.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.417
You know what?
I don't even care. You know why?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.583
Because I bet
she's calling out my name

04:12.667 --> 04:14.291
-while she's sleeping with him.
-(Danni) No, I don't!

04:14.375 --> 04:16.166
See, like a bat, dude!
Like a bat!

04:16.834 --> 04:18.917
-Check.
-Aah!

04:21.000 --> 04:24.458
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

04:24.542 --> 04:28.834
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:31.250 --> 04:32.875
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:36.041 --> 04:39.041
(J.D.) <i>It actually wasn't that</i>
<i>awkward breaking up with Danni.</i>

04:39.125 --> 04:40.667
<i>It was a little odd</i>

04:40.750 --> 04:44.375
<i>that she stuck around for 2 hours</i>
<i>to do her morning yoga.</i>

04:44.458 --> 04:45.834
Good morning, world.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.125
(J.D.)
<i>She seems almost peaceful.</i>

04:49.208 --> 04:51.333
Later, butt-licks.

04:51.417 --> 04:52.959
(J.D.)<i> Maybe not.</i>

04:53.041 --> 04:55.834
Just make sure you got all your
things out of my bedroom, ok?

04:55.917 --> 04:57.709
I brought all my stuff
to Danny's house 3 days ago.

04:57.792 --> 04:59.625
(laughs)

04:59.709 --> 05:01.792
(mouth full)
Crunch Berry, wrong pipe.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.875
-Mmm.
-(Danni) Hey, J.D.?

05:03.959 --> 05:06.083
Don't come chasing after me
like you do with Elliot.

05:06.166 --> 05:09.458
Because if there's one thing
everyone knows about John Dorian,

05:09.542 --> 05:12.041
is that he always wants
what he can't have.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.709
That's not true, is it?

05:15.792 --> 05:17.041
Hell, no.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.834
By the way, this is
the last bowl of cereal.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.709
It's just it's so hard to make
myself look for an apartment

05:27.792 --> 05:30.417
when I'm sharing my bed with the
most beautiful girl in the world.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.750
Really?
What's his name?

05:32.834 --> 05:37.458
(J.D.) <i>That made absolutely no</i>
<i>sense, so just keep sipping.</i>

05:37.542 --> 05:39.291
Come on, Sean. I want you to meet
this patient Tommy.

05:39.375 --> 05:42.333
He's only 5, but he's got, like,
the voice of a grown man.

05:42.417 --> 05:43.709
Yeah? He...

05:43.792 --> 05:45.834
Tommy, what are you doing
out of your room?

05:45.917 --> 05:47.917
(resonant baritone)
I go where I want.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.208
Awesome.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.834
-Turk!
-Mmm.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.041
Everything's wrong again.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.166
Baby, it's cool. We're meeting
with the cake guy tomorrow.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.583
Nothing's cool!
Nothing's cool!

05:58.667 --> 06:00.500
The centerpieces
are supposed to be cupids,

06:00.583 --> 06:03.125
but they have no arrows.
So, now they're just fat babies.

06:03.208 --> 06:07.667
I have 187 people who R.S.V.P.E.D,
yes, for a 125-seat wedding.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.041
Plus, I have to wear
my grandmother's choker,

06:10.125 --> 06:11.750
but with my hair up,
it makes me look like

06:11.834 --> 06:14.125
one of those African tribeswomen
with the coil around my neck!

06:14.208 --> 06:17.875
Ok, first off, you best be nice
to my cousin Nfume.

06:17.959 --> 06:20.291
Second, baby,
if we have too many guests,

06:20.375 --> 06:22.041
you can uninvite some people.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.083
-Really?
-Really. It'll be fine.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.166
-Close your eyes.
-Ok.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.834
-Take a deep breath.
-(deep breath)

06:29.917 --> 06:32.417
See how good that feels?
Now take another one.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.667
Take another one.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.750
Are you watching my boobs?

06:37.834 --> 06:39.250
Deep breath.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.125
Nice.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.875
Ah, thank you, Shirley.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.250
Damn it all to hell, Bob,

06:46.333 --> 06:48.583
I cannot believe you're
gonna turn this hospital

06:48.667 --> 06:49.917
into some moneymaking machine

06:50.000 --> 06:52.333
that coerces people into spending
their hard-earned cash

06:52.417 --> 06:54.417
on expensive procedures
that they don't even need.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.709
Why not?
Sounds like something I'd do.

06:56.792 --> 07:00.625
You Mark my words, if one single
person gets a full-body scan,

07:00.709 --> 07:03.917
I will, I will kiss your ring.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.458
I'll take that bet, champ.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.041
You're our witness, Laverne.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.542
How very exciting for all of us.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.458
I'm not even sweating,

07:11.542 --> 07:13.834
because, honest to God,
what kind of gullible chump

07:13.917 --> 07:16.959
would go ahead and spend
$1,000 on some silly scan

07:17.041 --> 07:19.417
if he's feeling perfectly fine?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.166
Hello, Laverne.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.500
-Shirl.
-No...

07:26.041 --> 07:28.500
-How's the chicken today?
-(gasps) Oh, my God, Turk!

07:28.583 --> 07:30.083
What if someone's vegetarian?

07:30.166 --> 07:32.625
I gotta go call the caterer!

07:32.709 --> 07:34.625
Thank you.
I just calmed her down.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.834
She's quite mad, you know.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.792
Hope she doesn't
rub off on you.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.125
Too easy.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.458
Please, man.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.208
I'm Christopher Duncan Turk.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.125
-Duncan?
-His dad loved doughnuts.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.375
That's not true, ok?
You really need to stop saying that.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.834
The point is,
I don't lose my cool.

07:51.375 --> 07:53.333
I don't know.
Remember back in college

07:53.417 --> 07:56.500
when we had tickets to see
Michael Jordan in the playoffs?

07:57.291 --> 07:59.083
<i>♪ We're going to see</i>
<i>Michael Jordan ♪</i>

07:59.166 --> 08:00.834
<i>♪ We're going to see</i>
<i>Michael Jordan ♪</i>

08:00.917 --> 08:02.458
<i>♪ We're going to see</i>

08:02.542 --> 08:04.166
<i>♪ 'Cause we got good tickets ♪</i>

08:04.250 --> 08:06.500
<i>♪ We went 500 miles ♪</i>

08:06.583 --> 08:09.500
Hey, was I supposed to bring
the tickets or the sandwiches?

08:16.917 --> 08:18.834
Aah!

08:18.917 --> 08:19.917
Aah!

08:20.000 --> 08:20.834
Oh, God.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.208
Aah! No!
Leave it on the floor!

08:23.291 --> 08:26.166
You leave it on the floor!
(crying) Oh, God!

08:26.750 --> 08:29.834
You shaved your head
for the first time after that.

08:29.917 --> 08:32.166
God, I wish we could go back in time
and see that game.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.709
Wanting what you can't have?

08:33.792 --> 08:35.291
Why are you here?

08:35.375 --> 08:37.417
Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!

08:37.500 --> 08:39.041
Man, I'd smoke her.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.458
Quiet time, Todd.

08:43.875 --> 08:46.875
I wanna know everything
that's wrong with me.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.542
Mr. Corman, you're
not even feeling bad.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.458
You don't need this scan.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.000
If it would make you happy,

08:53.083 --> 08:54.750
we can just go ahead
and do the exact same thing

08:54.834 --> 08:57.041
we've done the last 50 times
you've been in here,

08:57.125 --> 08:59.542
take your temperature, draw some
blood, and give you a rectal.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.583
It's your basic "ahh. Ow. Oh!"

09:01.667 --> 09:03.041
Why should I even listen to you?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.875
The last time I was here,
you tried to torture me

09:04.959 --> 09:06.583
to prove a point,
Dr., Dr., Dr...

09:06.667 --> 09:08.583
-Cox.
-Mengele!

09:08.667 --> 09:10.875
-Oh...
-Now, if you will excuse me,

09:10.959 --> 09:12.500
I've already talked to
the insurance company,

09:12.583 --> 09:16.291
so there is nothing you can say
that can stop me from doing this.

09:16.375 --> 09:17.583
Mr. Corman, apparently,

09:17.667 --> 09:20.458
your insurance company's
not gonna cover it.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.000
Good day to you, sir.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.041
I'm ready to make
the first incision.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.375
Nuh-uh.
You get to retract the pannus.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.000
You want me to hold the fat flaps?

09:30.083 --> 09:33.333
More than anything in the world.
Todd, you're up.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.250
-Thank you.
-Man!

09:35.333 --> 09:36.333
Now, this is your big shot,

09:36.417 --> 09:37.917
so if you don't want me
to throw you out of here,

09:38.000 --> 09:39.375
you've gotta get through
this whole procedure

09:39.458 --> 09:41.750
without making a single sex joke.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.208
No problem.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.917
All right, to really get at this, I
think we need to go in from behind.

09:49.417 --> 09:52.333
-(Dr. Miller) And stay out!
-Whew. Totally worth it.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.917
-You're pathetic.
-What?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.667
For 3 years, I've been watching you
pine after blonde doctor,

10:01.750 --> 10:03.834
and I gotta tell you,
everyone is sick of it.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.458
"Will they? Won't they?
Looks like they're going to.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.417
Ooh, at the last second,
something went--oh!"

10:07.500 --> 10:09.875
Come on. Enough already.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.709
I mean, you guys aren't
exactly Ross and Rachel.

10:11.792 --> 10:12.625
Who?

10:12.709 --> 10:15.125
Dr. Ross and Rachel
from bookkeeping.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.000
Mmm.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.375
Why don't you just let her be happy

10:18.458 --> 10:22.333
with stunningly handsome
full-lipped guy.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.709
You know, I don't even
care what you think.

10:25.792 --> 10:29.000
(J.D.) <i>In the heat of battle, it's</i>
<i>important to hold your ground...</i>

10:29.083 --> 10:30.583
Doctor.

10:30.667 --> 10:34.083
Well, now, bobbo, ya hooked him,
ya got him in the boat,

10:34.166 --> 10:36.500
but he still got away.

10:36.583 --> 10:39.291
(J.D.) <i>because victory can be</i>
<i>snatched away at the last second.</i>

10:39.375 --> 10:43.000
Mr. Corman, your full-body scan
is on the house.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.250
I'm listening.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.792
-Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.291
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes you don't</i>
<i>even know how it happened.</i>

10:51.417 --> 10:53.625
Baby, I don't get it. Last night,
I was the golden boy,

10:53.709 --> 10:55.125
and now I'm fat-flap guy.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.667
Why would Dr. Miller turn on me?
I've been great in surgery.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.291
I've been nice to her.
She's coming to the wedding.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.208
-No, she's not.
-What?

11:02.291 --> 11:03.667
I uninvited her.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.750
(J.D.) <i>Yep. It's amazing how your</i>
<i>world can change in an instant.</i>

11:09.834 --> 11:12.041
-Hey, guys, guess what?
-(laughs)

11:12.125 --> 11:14.291
I just asked Sean if he would
move in with me, and...

11:14.375 --> 11:16.291
-Tell them what you said.
-Yes.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.750
(laughs)
Isn't that great?!

11:17.834 --> 11:20.667
That is great!
Isn't that great?

11:20.750 --> 11:22.458
(J.D.) <i>Full-lipped bastard.</i>

11:22.542 --> 11:23.500
Great!

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
(J.D.) <i>What does Sean have</i>
<i>that I don't have?</i>

11:31.625 --> 11:34.667
Don't compare yourself to him.
He's better.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.083
Thanks for the lift, because
for some reason on Tuesdays,

11:41.166 --> 11:43.834
my feet just swell up
like jiffy pop bags.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.333
I'm sure it'll show up on the scan.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.000
Oh, if anything turns up green,

11:47.083 --> 11:49.125
it's probably an emerald
that I swallowed

11:49.208 --> 11:51.792
from my mother's jewelry box
when I was 5.

11:51.875 --> 11:54.667
Gee, I'd like to get that back
to her. Hey, what's going' on?

11:54.750 --> 11:55.875
Zip it. I know a shortcut.

11:55.959 --> 11:57.333
Help! I'm getting chair jacked!

11:57.417 --> 11:59.208
Ok, why are you mad?

11:59.291 --> 12:00.959
You told me to uninvite people.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.959
So, without asking,
you went to my new boss

12:03.041 --> 12:04.750
and told her you didn't want her
to come to the wedding?

12:04.834 --> 12:05.750
No.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.041
I told her we didn't
want her to come.

12:12.792 --> 12:15.250
Aah! Aah!

12:17.834 --> 12:20.458
Well, hello there.
Can I give you some help?

12:20.542 --> 12:22.333
(resonant baritone)
My mommy said you had lollipops.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.667
Give me a red one.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.458
So, moving in together, huh?

12:25.542 --> 12:27.667
Yeah. It's a little scary.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.542
(J.D.) <i>And just like that,</i>
<i>I saw my window.</i>

12:29.625 --> 12:31.041
It is scary.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.834
You know,
I knew this girl in college

12:32.917 --> 12:33.959
who moved in with her boyfriend.

12:34.041 --> 12:36.000
Everything changed.
Stopped talking to each other.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.166
Started fighting all the time.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.625
You know the rest.

12:39.709 --> 12:40.917
They broke up?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.834
Oh, no, he killed her.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.375
(woman) Dr. Reid?

12:44.458 --> 12:47.250
They need you to check on
that stabbing victim in room 301.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.333
(whispering)
Could be you.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.208
-What?
-Nothing.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.875
-Don't do that.
-Why are you here, Sean?

12:57.959 --> 13:00.333
Elliot listens to you, J.D.
Why are you messing with her head?

13:00.417 --> 13:01.792
It's 'cause he wants
what he can't have.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.083
Ok, new rule,
hospitals are for doctors

13:04.166 --> 13:06.208
and sick people only, ok?

13:06.291 --> 13:08.542
Look, J.D.,
you've had so many chances,

13:08.625 --> 13:09.875
and you never stepped up
to the plate.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.166
Me, I'm terrified,
but I'm going for it,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.041
because that's how much Elliot
and I mean to each other.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.709
We work.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.208
So if you really care about her,
you won't mess this up.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.709
Uninvite my boss, huh?

13:24.792 --> 13:27.041
Well, we'll see how she likes it
when I mess with her world.

13:27.125 --> 13:32.542
-Huh? Aah! Aah! Aah!
-Aah!

13:33.125 --> 13:35.375
Listen, I appreciate the lunch,

13:35.458 --> 13:38.083
but are you actually
trying to convince me,

13:38.166 --> 13:40.417
an admittedly frugal
hypochondriac,

13:40.500 --> 13:42.875
not to get a free
full-body scan?

13:42.959 --> 13:45.667
Mr. Corman,
you're not dying of anything.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.917
Although if you do try to swipe one
more bite of my lamb medallions,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.291
I will be forced to kill you.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.750
Well,
look who never learned to share.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.000
Listen to me!

13:53.083 --> 13:55.500
I am not losing a bet
to Bob Kelso.

13:55.583 --> 13:58.625
All this concern about my health
and my well-being,

13:58.709 --> 14:00.917
and it's about a bet?
You know what?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.166
That's a pretty reprehensible thing
to do.

14:03.250 --> 14:07.375
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a full-body scan to take.

14:10.417 --> 14:14.041
You drove me here. I'd like to see
a dessert menu, please.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.250
Ms. Espinoza,
it was a little difficult

14:18.333 --> 14:19.959
changing your cake
at the last minute,

14:20.041 --> 14:22.875
but I was able to make it nondairy
like you requested.

14:22.959 --> 14:24.250
My uncle Ramon thanks you,

14:24.333 --> 14:26.917
and the rest of the people
at table 3 thank you even more.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.500
(gasps)
Oh, it's perfect.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.875
Isn't it, Turk?

14:31.959 --> 14:33.625
What's up with the white
people on top?

14:33.709 --> 14:36.750
Turk, they don't have tiny,
plastic interracial couples.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.625
I'll just color it in with
some chocolate frosting.

14:39.709 --> 14:42.291
Oh, that's a great idea.

14:42.375 --> 14:43.834
-Put them in blackface.
-Turk.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.667
What? While you're at it, why don't
you put a string in the back of him

14:46.750 --> 14:48.750
so when you pull it he sings mammy?

14:48.834 --> 14:51.458
-Forget it.
-Where are you going?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.291
To the back of the bakery, where you
keep all the other colored cakes?

14:54.375 --> 14:58.083
I'm 'a call Jesse,
and we gonna march on your ass!

15:01.458 --> 15:02.625
Mmm.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.458
Hey, Elliot.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.542
Look, I was just goofing around
before about that whole thing.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.125
I think it's great you guys
are moving in together.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.542
Thanks, J.D. I...

15:14.208 --> 15:15.750
really needed
to hear that from you.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.208
(J.D.)
<i>Maybe it's true that I'm someone</i>

15:18.291 --> 15:20.208
<i>who only wants</i>
<i>what he can't have,</i>

15:20.291 --> 15:23.083
<i>but what if the thing I want is the</i>
<i>girl I'm supposed to end up with?</i>

15:24.291 --> 15:25.417
It should be me.

15:26.625 --> 15:27.834
What?

15:27.917 --> 15:30.875
Look, Elliot, every year
we bounce around this thing,

15:30.959 --> 15:32.500
and I've never had the courage to
just stand up

15:32.583 --> 15:33.917
and tell you how I feel.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.333
I'm crazy about you,

15:37.417 --> 15:39.125
and I want you to know
if I had the choice

15:39.208 --> 15:42.125
of hanging out
with anyone in the entire world

15:42.208 --> 15:43.291
or sitting at home with you,

15:43.417 --> 15:45.542
eating pizza,
watching a crappy TV show,

15:45.625 --> 15:47.542
I'd choose you every time.

15:48.625 --> 15:49.667
I...

15:52.500 --> 15:53.625
I have to go.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.208
Not yet you don't.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.458
(Mr. Corman) For Pete's sake!

16:07.458 --> 16:08.333
Will you leave me alone?

16:08.417 --> 16:12.208
Look, this baby would mess
with a normal person's mind,

16:12.291 --> 16:16.792
so please hear me when I say that if
you get this scan, it will ruin you.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.875
The next year of your life is gonna
be a series of endless tests,

16:19.959 --> 16:22.709
and I'll do whatever it takes to
keep that from happening to you,

16:22.792 --> 16:24.750
even if it means giving you
free medical treatment

16:24.834 --> 16:25.917
the rest of your life.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.542
How can I believe
that you even care about me?

16:29.208 --> 16:31.417
How are we doing, Mr. Corman?

16:31.500 --> 16:33.583
Oh, Bob. We...

16:34.417 --> 16:35.792
we just had our scan.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.083
-You win.
-And...

16:43.208 --> 16:44.917
Now, Perry, I know
that was our first date,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.959
but next time don't be afraid
to put a little feeling into it.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.709
There you go.

16:51.792 --> 16:53.667

about the bet anymore.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.250
-Do you want her there?
-No.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.750
She's too pretty.

19:14.834 --> 19:18.333
-I want people looking' at me.
-Ok, she's out.

19:18.417 --> 19:21.333
Dr. Turk.
Meet me in the O.R.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.083
-Fat flaps?
-(chuckles) You got it.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.834
I love fat flaps.

19:32.458 --> 19:33.709
I love you!

19:35.250 --> 19:38.125

<i>As for me, all I needed was Elliot.</i>

19:38.208 --> 19:40.875
Today is just so weird.
I mean...

19:40.959 --> 19:42.709
My whole future was
right there in front of me,

19:42.792 --> 19:46.709
and I just walked away,
all because of you.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.166
Well, I think
you made the right choice.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.875
(J.D.) <i>I think that the problem</i>
<i>with most people</i>

19:51.959 --> 19:53.250
<i>who want what they can't have</i>

19:53.375 --> 19:55.959
<i>is that when they actually</i>
<i>get the thing they covet,</i>

19:56.041 --> 19:57.875
<i>they don't want it anymore.</i>

19:57.959 --> 19:59.250
<i>But not this guy.</i>

20:01.458 --> 20:05.000
Well, Dr. Dorian, you have me.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.375
You finally have me.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.333
(record needle scratches)

20:09.417 --> 20:11.166
(J.D.)
<i>Oh, my God, I don't want her!</i>
