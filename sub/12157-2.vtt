WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:06.174
HEY, DAD. HOW 'BOUT
THEM BRONCOS, HUH?

00:06.207 --> 00:08.309
YOU THINK THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO ACCUMULATE ENOUGH TOUCHDOWNS

00:08.342 --> 00:10.511
IN ORDER TO WIN
THE FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.215
MANDY, WHY ARE YOU
PRETENDING TO LIKE FOOTBALL?

00:14.248 --> 00:18.386
YOU SCALPED YOUR TICKET TO
LAST YEAR'S HOME PLAYOFF GAME.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.753
YEAH, AND THE REST
OF THE FAMILY

00:19.787 --> 00:23.157
HAD TO SIT NEXT TO
A PROFANITY-SPEWING LOUDMOUTH.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.060
I DIDN'T LIKE THE SEAT
I WAS IN!

00:27.595 --> 00:29.197
OKAY, SO I DON'T REALLY
LIKE FOOTBALL,

00:29.230 --> 00:31.199
BUT I DO LIKE OUR NEW
QUARTERBACK--GREG ARCHER.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.734
DAD, HE'S SO GORG,
IT'S RIDIC!

00:35.236 --> 00:38.572
IN THIS COUNTRY,
WE STILL SPEAK ENGLISH.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.741
FOR NOW.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.677
HEY, EVIE, UM, TEACH ME
SOME, LIKE, FANCY FOOTBALL WORDS

00:43.711 --> 00:45.946
SO I CAN IMPRESS HIM.
OKAY.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.015
UH, A HAIL MARY
IS AN IMPOSSIBLE LONG SHOT.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.183
OH.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.352
LIKE YOU DATING
AN ALL-STATE QUARTERBACK.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.920
(water runs)

00:52.953 --> 00:56.357
YOU MUST BE HAPPY MANDY'S
TAKING AN INTEREST IN FOOTBALL.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.926
OH, I'M SO HAP,
IT'S RIDIC.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.962
GRANDPA!
(Vanessa) AHH!

01:01.995 --> 01:03.131
IS THAT THE SOUND OF LOVE?
I CAN HEAR IT.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.233
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THIS! LOOK AT THIS!

01:05.266 --> 01:08.736
HEY, I MADE SOME JELL-O
FOR YOU AND I PUT MEAT IN IT.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.639
WHAT, NO HUG FOR HIS DAD?

01:11.672 --> 01:14.208
NO. LAST TIME YOU HUGGED
SOMEONE AROUND HERE,

01:14.242 --> 01:16.710
WE HAD BOYD.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.246
(mouth full)
WHAT IS THIS, RYAN?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.880
OH, IT'S A NOTICE
FROM BOYD'S SCHOOL.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.615
I GUESS THE KIDS
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED

01:21.649 --> 01:23.083
TO PLAY DODGEBALL
AT RECESS.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.453
OH.
SOME PARENT WROTE
A LETTER COMPLAINING.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.321
SOME BUSYBODY MOM.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.123
THIS--THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

01:29.157 --> 01:31.825
WHEN PARENTS GET INVOLVED
IN THE SCHOOL.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.995
THEY'RE PROBABLY RIGHT,
THOUGH.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.897
I MEAN, DODGEBALL CAN BE
A REALLY ROUGH GAME.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.300
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE THE FIRST
GIRL IN SCHOOL WITH BOOBS,

01:39.333 --> 01:41.169
AND THE BOYS JUST KEEP
THROWING BALLS AT YOU

01:41.202 --> 01:43.137
TO WATCH THEM BOUNCE.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.039
ON BEHALF OF ALL MEN,
I'M SORRY.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.510
HEY, DELILAH, YOU DON'T
SPEAK FOR ALL MEN.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.745
THIS IS CRAZY.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.113
KIDS GOTTA KNOW
HOW TO PLAY DODGEBALL.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.283
WHO'S GONNA PROTECT US
WHEN THE CHINESE ATTACK?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.185
AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.953
YOU KNOW, THEY SOFTEN US UP WITH
LEAD-BASED PAINTS FOR THE TOYS.

01:59.987 --> 02:03.757
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, GATE'S
OPEN, THE HORDES COME IN.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.026
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
SO YOUR HOMELAND DEFENSE PLAN

02:06.059 --> 02:09.029
IS A LINE OF CHILDREN
WITH RED RUBBER BALLS?

02:09.062 --> 02:11.332
THE TRANSITION
FROM THROWING BALLS

02:11.365 --> 02:15.369
TO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES
IS SEAMLESS.

02:17.004 --> 02:20.007
-- Captions by VITA --

02:23.744 --> 02:25.513
HEY, RYAN, WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE

02:25.546 --> 02:27.481
THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT
DODGEBALL ALL OF A SUDDEN?

02:27.515 --> 02:30.050
KIDS GET HURT
PLAYING DODGEBALL.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.052
COME ON, NOT WHEN THEIR
FASTBALLS TOP OUT

02:32.085 --> 02:33.821
AT 3 MILES AN HOUR.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.589
I DON'T KNOW.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.493
(chuckles) H-HEY. HEY.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.830
HEY...

02:42.863 --> 02:46.500
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
THE BUSYBODY MOM THAT DID THIS.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.770
DODGEBALL SIMULATES WAR, MAN.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.308
IT ENCOURAGES THE STRONG
TO VICTIMIZE THE WEAK.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.244
IT HURTS PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

02:56.277 --> 03:00.648
WELL, NOT AS MUCH AS WAR.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.484
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA GET
INTO A BIG DEBATE WITH YOU...

03:03.517 --> 03:05.152
THERE'S NO DEBATE HERE.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.
OVER THE VIRTUES

03:05.185 --> 03:07.087
OF TEACHING KIDS
HOW TO HURT EACH OTHER.
HURT EACH OTHER?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.689
BOYD IS MY SON
24 HOURS A DAY--
HE WASN'T FOR A YEAR
WHEN YOU RAN AWAY.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.691
NOT JUST AT MY PLACE.
AND I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.159
OKAY, PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN.
I MAKE THE RULES.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.327
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.662
AND THEN, WHEN I MAKE
A RULE,

03:14.695 --> 03:16.530
I CHECK WITH HIS MOM,

03:16.564 --> 03:19.267
TO MAKE SURE THAT
SHE AUTHORIZES THAT RULE.
ALL RIGHT.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.602
AND WHICH OF YOUR MANY RULES
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NOW?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.003
YOU KNOW, THAT THING

03:23.036 --> 03:24.272
I WAS TRYING TO GET
BANNED AT BOYD'S SCHOOL.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.373
SODA MACHINES?
MNH-MNH.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.507
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE?
NO.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.508
PIZZA?
CLOSER.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.710
DODGEBALL?
DODGEBALL.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.078
SEE? WE'RE ON
THE SAME PAGE.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.013
YEAH, RYAN AND I FEEL
THAT TOO MUCH COMPETITION

03:33.046 --> 03:34.081
IS BAD FOR LITTLE KIDS.

03:34.114 --> 03:37.084
FOR UNCOORDINATED KIDS, MAYBE.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.686
WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.521
ACTUALLY, BOYD'S TEACHER
PLAYS THIS REALLY SWEET

03:40.554 --> 03:43.591
VERSION OF MUSICAL CHAIRS
WHERE THERE ARE ENOUGH CHAIRS

03:43.624 --> 03:46.560
FOR ALL THE KIDS TO SIT IN
WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.896
YOU'RE KIDDING.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.298
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
MUSICAL CHAIRS.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.434
THAT'S JUST WALKING AROUND
IN A CIRCLE AND SITTING DOWN.

03:53.467 --> 03:57.137
THAT'S JUST PRACTICE
FOR GETTING TO BE 90.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.073
H-HOW DO THE KIDS KNOW
IF THEY WIN OR LOSE AT THAT?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.810
EVERY CHILD IS A WINNER,
MIKE.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.278
I FORGOT.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.880
LIFE IS JUST ONE BIG
PARTICIPATION TROPHY.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.782
YOU JUST SHOW UP,
YOU'RE A WINNER!

04:08.816 --> 04:10.418
WELL, IT'S TRUE.
IT'S NOT TRUE.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.219
JUST BY BEING BORN,
YOU'VE WON THE LOTTERY.
HOW'S THAT?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.253
LOOK AT THE ODDS.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.888
IN THE AVERAGE MALE EMISSION,

04:14.922 --> 04:17.124
THERE ARE 300 MILLION
SPERMATOZOA.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.495
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOUR WORD
FOR THAT, I REALLY AM.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.732
LOOK, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
IS BOYD PARTICIPATING

04:24.765 --> 04:26.099
IN AN ACTIVITY AS SAVAGE
AS DODGEBALL.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.134
GOT IT.
END OF STORY.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.469
THAT'S NOT THE END
OF THE STORY.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.903
END OF THE STORY
IS THE CHINESE

04:29.937 --> 04:31.505
PLANTING THEIR FLAG
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.074
TELL BOYD I'LL PICK HIM UP
TOMORROW,

04:34.107 --> 04:35.242
AFTER YOGA.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.310
MMM.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.447
HEY, HEY, HEY, KRISTIN,
I GOT AN IDEA.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.350
WHY DON'T I PAY FOR
ANOTHER PATERNITY TEST?

04:44.117 --> 04:47.154
YOU NEVER KNOW. MAYBE
WE'LL GET RESULTS I LIKE.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.189
OKAY. MAYBE RYAN AND I
DIDN'T WORK OUT,

04:49.222 --> 04:50.658
BUT HE'S STILL
BOYD'S FATHER,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.760
AND I HAVE TO TAKE
HIS FEELINGS INTO ACCOUNT.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.362
OH, HE'S GOT A LOT OF FEELINGS.
I BET HE PUTS THEM DOWN

04:54.395 --> 04:56.497
IN A LITTLE PINK BOOK
WITH A BUTTERFLY ON IT.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.467
DAD, WILL--WILL YOU JUST
TRY AND GET ALONG WITH RYAN?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.034
OKAY? I WANT HIM AROUND
FOR BOYD,

05:01.068 --> 05:03.036
EVEN IF HE IS
A LITTLE OVERPROTECTIVE.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.340
OOH! NOW WE TALK ABOUT
PROTECTION!

05:10.844 --> 05:12.680
HEY, KYLE.
HMM?

05:12.713 --> 05:14.281
YOU EVER PLAY DODGEBALL
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.516
OH, YEAH.
YEAH.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.884
IT WAS GREAT.
WASN'T IT?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.285
EXCEPT I DIDN'T LIKE

05:18.318 --> 05:21.021
THE "GETTING HIT
BY THE BALL" PART.

05:21.054 --> 05:24.625
OR THE "HITTING THE OTHER
KIDS WITH THE BALL" PART.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.127
THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTS.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
YEAH. I GUESS IT WASN'T
THAT GREAT.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.466
COFFEE, ED?
NO, THANKS, KYLE.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.301
I HAVE TO GET OUT
TO THE CHOPPER.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.304
MIKE, THEY LOCATED THAT KID
THAT GOT LOST ON MOUNT EVANS.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.039
THANK GOD.
YEAH.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.474
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
VOLUNTEERING

05:40.508 --> 05:41.809
WITH THE SEARCH AND RESCUE
RANGERS?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.243
WHAT WAS
YOUR FIRST MISSION, ED?

05:43.276 --> 05:45.212
YOU WERE SEARCHING
THE DESERT, REMEMBER?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.615
FOR MOSES AND THE ISRAELITES.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.351
YEAH. AND TODAY
I'M ON THE ROPE.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.854
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO
RAPPEL DOWN,

05:53.887 --> 05:56.023
TRAMP THROUGH THE BRAMBLE,
AND HAUL THAT FRIGHTENED

05:56.056 --> 05:59.226
LITTLE SNOT-NOSED MORON
UP TO SAFETY.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.429
WELL, HE'LL BE STARING
INTO THE FACE OF LOVE.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.364
NO, OFFENSE, BUT AREN'T
YOU A LITTLE OLD

06:04.398 --> 06:06.233
TO BE JUMPING OUT
OF HELICOPTERS?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.601
COME ON. LOOK AT HIM.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.937
HOW MANY YEARS IS HE
REALLY RISKING?

06:12.105 --> 06:15.042
KYLE, ME AND THE GUYS
ARE NEVER GONNA RETIRE.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.445
YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE EVERY TIME
WE BRING IN SOME YOUNG BLOOD,

06:17.478 --> 06:19.713
WE FIND THAT YOUR GENERATION
CAN'T HACK IT.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.181
AND THEY NEVER WILL.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.050
WE'RE ON A DOWNWARD
WIMP SPIRAL WITH MEN.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.685
MY GRANDSON'S GOT
SO MANY RULES--

06:24.718 --> 06:26.186
CAN'T THROW A BALL.
RIGHT.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.421
CAN'T THROW A STICK.
YEAH.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.523
CAN'T DRINK STUFF YOU FIND
IN THE GARAGE.

06:29.557 --> 06:33.060
THAT'S HOW I SAW
MY FIRST FLYING LIZARD.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.529
HEY, I CAN HACK IT.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.197
TAKE ME ALONG
ON THE SEARCH AND RESCUE.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.899
WHOO! GOOD LUCK, EDDIE.
OH, NO, NO, NO, KYLE.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.367
I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO HAUL UP

06:40.400 --> 06:42.970
TWO SNOT-NOSED MORONS
UP THAT ROPE.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.973
PLEASE. I'M TOUGHER
THAN I LOOK.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.875
(sips and chokes)

06:47.908 --> 06:50.243
THAT IS SOME STRONG
CHAMOMILE.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.217
HEY, SWEETIE.
HEY, DAD.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.420
CELERY--COMPLETELY USELESS,
EXCEPT WHEN USED

07:00.454 --> 07:02.490
AS A PEANUT BUTTER
DELIVERY SYSTEM.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.792
THEY'RE FOR BOYD
AND HIS FRIENDS.
WILD PACK OF BOYS.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.060
(cowboy accent) ABOUT TIME WE
HAD SOME MAYHEM AROUND HERE!

07:07.094 --> 07:09.630
(laughs)

07:09.663 --> 07:11.298
(cartoon playing on TV)

07:11.331 --> 07:14.334
YEAH. MAYHEM!

07:15.469 --> 07:18.105
OKAY, BOYS,
DO WHAT EVE SAYS.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.107
THEIR FOLKS SHOULD BE OVER
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.142
NO WORRIES.
THIS IS PAY-PER-VIEW.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.444
THEY VIEW, AND I GET PAID.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.648
(cowboy accent) ALL RIGHT!

07:27.681 --> 07:29.016
I'VE BEEN WAITIN' FOR THE DAY

07:29.049 --> 07:32.019
WHEN WE GOT MORE MEN
IN THIS HOUSE THAN WOMEN.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.021
COME ON! HYAH!
(snapping fingers)

07:34.054 --> 07:35.155
COME ON, NOW,
LET'S DO SOMETHING!

07:35.188 --> 07:37.124
(laughs)

07:37.157 --> 07:38.992
YO!

07:39.026 --> 07:40.427
(normal voice) COME ON!
LET'S DO SOMETHING!

07:40.460 --> 07:42.129
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

07:42.162 --> 07:45.032
YOU THINK I'D AGREE TO
WATCH THEM IF THEY EVER MOVED?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.700
THEY'RE MOVING NOW.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.468
TV'S OFF.
DONE, DONE, DONE.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.970
GRANDPA!
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GONNA DO?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.005
LISTEN UP.
WE'RE GOING TO A MAGIC PLACE.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.508
IT'S CALLED OUTSIDE!

07:54.542 --> 07:56.810
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?

07:56.844 --> 07:59.012
WE'RE GONNA PLAY DODGEBALL.
COME ON. GET UP.

07:59.046 --> 08:02.182
GET YOUR PRE-DIABETIC BODIES
AND MOVE. LET'S GO!

08:02.215 --> 08:05.352
LET'S GET SOME MOVEMENT!
MOVE, MOVE! COME ON!
(claps hands)

08:11.424 --> 08:13.493
ALL RIGHT. BOYD, YOU'RE
GONNA BE TEAM CAPTAIN.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.862
GOTTA PICK A PARTNER.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.997
PICKING TEAMS HURTS
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.498
(laughing) YOU BET IT DOES.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.233
AND IT JUST MAKES THEM
TRY HARDER.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.202
AND THEN THEY WORK HARDER.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

08:22.235 --> 08:24.572
AMERICA HAS BUILT
AN ECONOMIC ENGINE

08:24.605 --> 08:26.774
NEVER BEFORE SEEN
IN HISTORY!

08:29.242 --> 08:31.178
ALL RIGHT.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.046
BOYD, YOU AND SPENCE
ON ONE TEAM.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.015
FOUR-EYES, YOU AND FRECKLES
OVER HERE. OVER HERE.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.750
ALL RIGHT, EVE,
BREAK IT DOWN FOR 'EM.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.519
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP!
(blows whistle)

08:39.553 --> 08:41.321
FIRST RULE OF DODGEBALL CLUB--

08:41.354 --> 08:43.591
NO ONE TALKS ABOUT
DODGEBALL CLUB.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.158
FIRST RULE--NO ONE TALKS
ABOUT IT.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.560
SECOND RULE--

08:47.561 --> 08:49.997
NO HEAD SHOTS. OKAY?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.600
HIT SOMEONE ABOVE
THE SHOULDERS, YOU'RE OUT.

08:52.633 --> 08:56.870
BUT I'M GONNA LIE TO YOU,
IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT.

08:56.904 --> 09:00.240
WE GET TO PLAY DODGEBALL?
ISN'T THAT AGAINST THE RULES?

09:00.273 --> 09:03.010
MY BEACH, MY OCEAN.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.444
AROUND HERE,
WE DO WHAT WE WANT.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.347
AND I SAY... (chuckles)

09:07.380 --> 09:09.817
TAKE THE BALL
AND WHIP IT GOOD.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.393
STOP!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.097
YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF WORSE
WALKING AROUND IN A CIRCLE

09:24.131 --> 09:25.766
AND JUST SITTING DOWN!

09:25.799 --> 09:27.300
EVE, SHOW THEM HOW TO
THROW THAT BALL.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.070
YOU WANT YOUR OPPONENT
TO KNOW HE'S BEEN HIT.
MM-HMM.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.139
LIKE THIS. BOO-YAH!

09:32.172 --> 09:33.540
YEAH!
HUH?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.709
IT'S YOUR TURN, KID.
LET'S GO.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.577
LEGS INTO IT. LET'S GO.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.946
READY? PLAY!

09:38.979 --> 09:40.881
(blows whistle)

09:40.914 --> 09:42.149
(ball thwacks loudly)
OW!

09:42.182 --> 09:44.618
(laughs) WELL, THAT HAD
TO HURT, HUH?

09:46.119 --> 09:48.255
(Mike) HEY, SIT DOWN.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.491
THAT'S A HEAD SHOT,
FANCY PANTS. YOU'RE OUT.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.995
(laughs) WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
IT'S A RUSH, RIGHT?

09:55.028 --> 09:58.598
LISTEN, SPENCE, THERE'S TWO
PARTS TO DODGEBALL AS A GAME.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.267
FIRST PART IS THE BALL,
WHICH YOU'RE...

10:00.300 --> 10:04.004
(laughing) VERY FAMILIAR
WITH RIGHT NOW, HUH?

10:04.037 --> 10:06.239
THE DODGE PART,
WE GOTTA WORK ON.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.341
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
RIGHT NOW IS

10:08.375 --> 10:10.678
THAT WHEN YOUR MOM
GETS HERE, THIS HAPPENED

10:10.711 --> 10:13.180
'CAUSE YOU RAN INTO A DOOR.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.155
HI. MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.824
HEALTHY COMPETITION.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.759
IT'S FROWNED UPON
IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD--

10:25.793 --> 10:29.129
LIKE NORTH KOREA,
THE TEACHERS' UNION--

10:29.162 --> 10:30.597
BUT NOT HERE AT OUTDOOR MAN.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.200
WE LIKE HEALTHY COMPETITION.
WE ENCOURAGE IT, ACTUALLY.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.002
WE WANT YOU TO CATCH
THE BIGGEST FISH.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.204
AND WE DON'T CARE WHOSE
FEELINGS GET HURT.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.472
BUT YOU KNOW WHO DOES CARE
ABOUT FEELINGS IN FISHING?

10:39.506 --> 10:42.976
THOSE PEOPLE FISHING OVER
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LAKE.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.345
YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
CATCHING A FISH OVER THERE.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.348
IF IT'S A BIG ONE,
THEY'LL CONFISCATE IT FROM YOU.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.350
THEY'LL CHOP IT UP
IN LITTLE PIECES

10:50.383 --> 10:53.954
AND GIVE IT AWAY TO THE PEOPLE
TOO LAZY TO LEARN HOW TO FISH.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.957
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU KEEP GIVING PEOPLE FISH,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.325
THEY'RE GONNA KEEP EATING IT.

10:58.358 --> 11:02.930
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WON'T DO?
IS LEARN HOW TO FISH.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.134
HELLO, MIKE.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.137
OH, CONGRATULATIONS
FINDING THAT BOY.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.740
YOU GUYS WERE ON
THE 5:00 NEWS LAST NIGHT.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.076
OHH. WHO CAN STAY UP
THAT LATE?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.577
SO HOW'D KYLE DO?

11:17.610 --> 11:19.747
OH, THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA, MIKE.
WHAT?!

11:19.780 --> 11:21.381
WHAT, DID HE SLOW YOU DOWN?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.515
(chuckles) HE WOULDN'T STOP.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.718
HE WENT DOWN THE ROPE
A SECOND TIME

11:24.752 --> 11:27.154
JUST TO GET THE KID'S HAT.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.257
MAYBE HE THOUGHT IT WAS
ANOTHER KID STUCK IN THE SNOW.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.926
KYLE'S A NATURAL.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.063
I MEAN, I VASTLY PREFER MAKING
FUN OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION

11:36.096 --> 11:39.066
THAN GETTING MY BUTT
KICKED BY THEM.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.702
HEY. THERE HE IS--
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.905
(chuckles) WELL, YOU'RE
A LITTLE LATE, SON.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.940
YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING
OUT OF BED THIS MORNING?

11:46.974 --> 11:48.708
NO. I'VE ALREADY CLEANED
THE LOADING DOCK.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.043
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE.

11:51.779 --> 11:52.746
HOW YOU FEELING?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.714
OH! LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

11:54.748 --> 11:55.715
(laughs) GREAT.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.950
AHH. (laughing)
(laughing)

11:59.920 --> 12:01.521
(groans) LIKE A MILLION BUCKS

12:01.554 --> 12:04.291
ARE DRIVING THEIR ANTLERS
INTO MY BACK.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.492
(groans)

12:08.328 --> 12:10.297
HEY.
HEY.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.932
HOW'D IT GO
WITH GREG ARCHER?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.733
DID YOU USE ANY OF THE FOOTBALL
TERMS I TAUGHT YOU?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.769
AH, I TRIED,
AND I TOTALLY CHOKED.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.938
BUT, UM, IT TURNS OUT
THERE'S SOMETHING HE LIKES

12:17.971 --> 12:19.773
EVEN MORE THAN TALKING
ABOUT FOOTBALL.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.044
EW!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.645
YEAH. ACTUALLY, IT TURNS OUT

12:25.678 --> 12:27.915
HE DOESN'T EVEN REALLY LIKE
TALKING THAT MUCH.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.649
SO WE DIDN'T TALK...

12:29.682 --> 12:32.285
(singsongy) FOR A LONG TIME!

12:32.319 --> 12:34.721
(clicks tongue)
THE AGE-OLD STORY--

12:34.754 --> 12:37.257
BOY MEETS GIRL,
BOY MAKES OUT WITH GIRL,

12:37.290 --> 12:41.261
GIRL TELLS SISTER, AND SISTER
WANTS HER TWO MINUTES BACK.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.465
(deep voice) WELL, THE LAST TIME
I SAW THAT MONKEY,

12:45.498 --> 12:47.968
HE WAS TRYING TO SHOVE
THE CORK BACK IN.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.337
SO, OKAY.
(normal voice) WHAT A CROWD.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.939
WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH
A BIG CROWD?

12:51.972 --> 12:54.074
YEAH, SOMEONE DID
A TERRIBLE JOB

12:54.107 --> 12:56.276
WITH THE FIRST RULE
OF DODGEBALL CLUB, HUH?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.845
SPENCE?

13:01.714 --> 13:04.251
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE LINE UP!
LET'S GO!

13:04.284 --> 13:07.587
ALL RIGHT, BOYD, SHOW US
WHAT YOU CAN DO, BUDDY.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.923
READY? PLAY!
(blows whistle)

13:09.957 --> 13:11.458
(grunting)

13:11.491 --> 13:14.828
SO WHEN KRISTIN AND RYAN
SAID "NO DODGEBALL,"

13:14.862 --> 13:17.630
YOU HEARD THAT AS "DODGEBALL"?

13:17.664 --> 13:20.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, EITHER.
I WAS OUTVOTED 2-TO-1.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.802
OH, NO. HONEY, NO.
IT'S NOT 2-TO-1,

13:22.836 --> 13:24.371
IT'S 2-TO-0.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.306
AS GRANDPARENTS, WE'RE LIKE
PEOPLE IN PENNSYLVANIA

13:26.339 --> 13:30.177
WITHOUT DRIVER'S LICENSES.
YOU DON'T GET A VOTE.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.179
ARE YOU REALLY COMFORTABLE
WITH PEOPLE VOTING

13:32.212 --> 13:34.347
THAT CAN'T EVEN DRIVE A CAR?

13:34.381 --> 13:37.450
FACE IT, MIKE--
YOU HAVE NO SAY.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.986
LOOK, I PAY FOR EVERYTHING
AROUND HERE.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.222
THAT'S LIKE TAXATION
WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.857
COME ON, YOU HAVE TO RESPECT
KRISTIN AND RYAN'S

13:43.891 --> 13:45.058
PARENTING DECISIONS,
THAT'S ALL.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.494
I WILL WHENEVER THEY MAKE
A GOOD ONE.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.496
LOOK, YOU GAVE ME THREE GIRLS.
I LOVE THEM...

13:49.529 --> 13:51.564
(children shouting playfully)
BUT NOW I GET A CHANCE
TO RAISE A BOY,

13:51.598 --> 13:54.667
AND YOU WANT ME TO LET
HIS DAD TURN HIM INTO A GIRL?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.203
(ball bouncing)
YEAH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.972
UH, SEX IS DETERMINED
BY THE MALE.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.508
IF THAT WERE THE CASE,
WE'D BE DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.544
(ball thwacks)
(Boyd) OW!

14:04.577 --> 14:06.880
OH, HONEY. COME HERE.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.983
FIRST ONE OUT--
JUST LIKE HIS DAD.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.484
OHH!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.921
COME ON, CHAMP,
WE'LL GET 'EM NEXT TIME, OKAY?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.925
FIRST ONE OUT AGAIN.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.692
(ball thwacks)

14:19.726 --> 14:22.162
WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAD
YOUR HANDS UP THIS TIME.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.232
(ball thwacks)
YOU LI GETTING HIT
WITH THE BALL?!

14:25.265 --> 14:27.700
I SUCK AT THIS.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.236
HEY, WATCH YOUR TONGUE.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.603
YEAH, IT SOUNDS LIKE
DODGEBALL'S

14:30.637 --> 14:31.838
NOT THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE TEACHING HIM.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.907
I CAN'T SEE THIS ANYMORE.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.242
HE'S TOAST, DAD.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.044
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
CUT OUR LOSSES.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.878
EVE! LISTEN...

14:38.912 --> 14:40.780
I THINK YOU'RE REALLY
DOING GOOD OUT THERE.

14:40.813 --> 14:44.084
I REALLY DO.
WHAT GAME ARE YOU
WATCHING?

14:44.117 --> 14:45.885
(chuckles)

14:45.919 --> 14:47.720
WINNING AND LOSING
ARE PART OF THE GAME.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.023
YOU GOT THE LOSING DOWN.
DOESN'T FEEL SO GOOD.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.925
I SAY
WE CONCENTRATE ON WINNING.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.360
THAT MEANS YOU GOTTA
DODGE THAT BALL.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.627
IF EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS,

14:54.661 --> 14:56.829
JUST USE SPENCE
AS A HUMAN SHIELD.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.001
OKAY, GAME ON!
EVERYONE LINE UP!

15:02.936 --> 15:05.038
READY? PLAY!
(blows whistle)

15:05.072 --> 15:07.440
(children shouting playfully)

15:07.474 --> 15:09.042
BOYD?
HEY, DAD!

15:09.076 --> 15:10.843
LOOK OUT!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.616
HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.886
THESE KIDS JUST WANDERED
IN HERE FROM THE CORNFIELDS.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.062
OKAY, GUYS, MOVIE TIME!
(claps hands)

15:29.096 --> 15:30.763
POPSICLE, POPSICLE,

15:30.797 --> 15:32.665
POPSICLE...

15:32.699 --> 15:34.267
OOH. JUST HOLD THAT
ON YOUR FACE

15:34.301 --> 15:36.970
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.506
I RAN INTO A DOOR.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.313
HOW COULD YOU DEFY ME
LIKE THAT?

15:46.346 --> 15:47.847
I DIDN'T DEFY YOU.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.816
I JUST IGNORED YOU.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.785
RYAN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE CULPABLE HERE, TOO.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.954
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ALL I DID WAS
TELL MIKE HE COULDN'T DO IT.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.923
EXACTLY. YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE PUT THE DODGEBALL

15:56.956 --> 15:59.426
RIGHT IN HIS HANDS.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.161
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO
WALK IN HERE

16:01.194 --> 16:03.796
AND SEE MY KID CATCH THE BALL
WITH HIS FACE.

16:03.830 --> 16:07.967
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.
HE'S DEFINITELY YOUR KID.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.636
HOW ARE YOU STILL DEFENDING
THIS? BOYD GOT HURT.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.804
HE'LL BE FINE. HE GOT HIT
IN THE FACE WITH A DODGEBALL.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.873
COME ON! HE'LL GET BETTER
NEXT TIME.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.376
IF YOU DON'T GIVE A KID
A CHANCE TO GET BETTER AT STUFF,

16:16.409 --> 16:19.312
HE'S JUST STUCK BEING
A LOSER, JUST LIKE...

16:19.346 --> 16:21.614
OTHER PEOPLE
THAT ARE LOSERS.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.316
WELL, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A NEXT TIME,

16:23.350 --> 16:24.817
BECAUSE HE'S NOT PLAYING
ANYMORE.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.819
VERY ADULT. VERY ADULT.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.856
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
YOU GET A TEXT THAT SAYS,

16:29.889 --> 16:33.826
"DODGEBALL CLUB AT YOUR HOUSE"
WITH SEVEN EXCLAMATION POINTS.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.995
YOU CALLED HER HOME
FROM WORK FOR THIS?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.631
DAD, I THOUGHT WE TALKED
ABOUT RESPECTING OUR WISHES.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.733
IF WE TELL BOYD SOMETHING
AND YOU UNDERMINE US,

16:40.767 --> 16:42.469
HE'S NEVER GONNA LISTEN
TO ANYTHING WE SAY.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.003
REALLY? LET ME PUT
YOUR MIND AT EASE.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.638
I'VE RAISED THREE KIDS.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.740
THEY NEVER LISTEN
TO WHAT YOU SAY. ALL RIGHT?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.542
CASE IN POINT--

16:49.576 --> 16:51.578
REMEMBER THE BIRTH CONTROL
CONVERSATION WE HAD?

16:51.611 --> 16:52.979
IT'S SITTING OUT THERE

16:53.012 --> 16:55.748
WITH A LITTLE POPSICLE
AGAINST ITS CHEEK.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.318
WHAT YOU DID
IS SO NOT COOL!
SO NOT COOL.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.986
I MEAN,
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF--
WHERE, INDEED!

17:00.019 --> 17:01.721
I GOT THIS!

17:01.754 --> 17:03.556
SHE'S GOT THIS.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.860
WELL, HE'S GONE.
NOW YOU CAN BE HONEST.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.762
YEAH, HE'S GONE.
AND THE LAST TIME HE WAS GONE,

17:09.796 --> 17:11.764
IT TOOK HIM TWO YEARS
TO FIND HIS WAY BACK.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.700
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE YOUR NAME

17:13.733 --> 17:15.435
AND MOVE OUT OF THE STATE.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.071
I WANT MY SON TO GROW UP
WITH HIS FATHER IN HIS LIFE.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.772
IF YOU KEEP BEING MEAN
TO RYAN,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.841
IT'LL GIVE HIM AN EXCUSE
TO--TO LEAVE FOR GOOD.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.011
JUST HOW MEAN WOULD I
HAVE TO BE? (laughs)

17:25.044 --> 17:27.580
DAD, I LOVE YOU.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.217
NOW BUTT THE HELL OUT
OF RAISING MY KID.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.955
AHH. A FRIENDLY FACE.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.057
YOU'RE A DUMBASS.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.760
SAYING SUCH UNFRIENDLY THINGS!

17:46.233 --> 17:47.400
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

17:47.434 --> 17:50.470
I'M BABYSITTING.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
WHERE'S BOYD?

17:51.771 --> 17:53.973
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T GET PAID FOR HIM.

18:00.680 --> 18:05.552
MOM, YOU WOULD LOOK AMAZING
IN THESE FLANNEL PAJAMAS.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.220
WOW. HEY... (chuckles)

18:07.254 --> 18:08.788
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD PULL IT OFF

18:08.821 --> 18:11.324
AS WELL AS THIS
80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.594
(ball bouncing)

18:14.627 --> 18:16.062
WHAT WAS THAT?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.832
IT'S BOYD. HE'S BEEN OUT THERE
PRACTICING FOR AN HOUR.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.501
YOU'D THINK GETTING HIT
IN THE HEAD

18:21.534 --> 18:23.470
WOULD HAVE KNOCKED SOME
SENSE INTO HIM.
(chuckles)

18:23.503 --> 18:24.871
WELL, IMAGINE THAT.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.641
WORKING HARD AT SOMETHING
TO GET BETTER AT IT.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.942
OR TELLING HIM
HE CAN'T DO SOMETHING

18:29.976 --> 18:31.478
MAKES HIM WANT
TO DO IT MORE.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.481
EITHER WAY, HE IS
DEFINITELY A BAXTER.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.782
(speaks indistinctly)

18:35.815 --> 18:39.186
(ball bouncing)

18:49.729 --> 18:53.166
HE'S, UH, LOSING TO HIMSELF.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.640
LISTEN, UM...

19:00.673 --> 19:04.477
I'LL DO BETTER LETTING
THE PARENTS DO THE PARENTING.

19:04.511 --> 19:08.147
(ball bouncing)

19:08.181 --> 19:10.850
ALL RIGHT. GO WHIP A BALL
AT MY SON.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.721
I BETTER CALL HIS DAD
AND ASK.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.022
I'LL HANDLE RYAN.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.725
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.193
(claps hands)
ALL RIGHT, BOYD,
GIVE ME THE BALL.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.828
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOT
AT YOUR HEAD.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.564
I MEAN, DAD'S BETTER
THAN A WALL, RIGHT?

19:24.597 --> 19:27.367
OH, AND TWICE AS STUBBORN.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.001
(ball thwacks)
(Boyd) OW!

19:29.035 --> 19:32.739
I-I GOTTA GET A POPSICLE.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.074
I RAN INTO A DOOR.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.082
HEY, MIKE.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.551
HEY, ED. HOW YOU DOING?

19:44.584 --> 19:47.587
I'M EXHAUSTED. WE HAD
A LATE-NIGHT RESCUE.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.723
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN--7:15?

19:50.757 --> 19:53.893
(groaning) I JUST CAN'T
KEEP UP WITH KYLE.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.929
I FEEL LIKE I'M LETTING
OUR GENERATION DOWN, MIKE.

19:56.963 --> 20:00.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OUR GENERATION," WHITE MAN?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.836
YOU KNOW, THE OLD GUARD.
COME ON.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.738
KID'S COMING IN.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.907
LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO DO
A LITTLE GRECO-ROMAN WRESTLING.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.042
SLIP OFF YOUR CLOTHES.
GET ALL OILED UP.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.382
99... 100.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.949
ALL RIGHT. (laughs) YEAH.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.752
OKAY. I THINK I'M GONNA
HIT THE WEIGHTS NOW.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.388
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE, SIR.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.423
(laughing)

20:24.557 --> 20:27.460
SO... WHAT'S UP, BUTTERCUP?

20:27.494 --> 20:30.997
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THOSE CRAZY OLD DUDES.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.768
DO YOU THINK...
ED WILL BE UPSET IF I QUIT?

20:35.802 --> 20:39.105
WOW, WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU
AROUND HERE.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.741
NO, I MEAN, QUIT THE RANGERS.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.910
OH. NO.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.281
I MEAN, EVERY MUSCLE
IN MY BODY ACHES.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.649
DO YOU HAVE ANY IBUPROFEN?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.484
DO I LOOK LIKE
A NURSE TO YOU?

20:51.518 --> 20:53.453
LISTEN, I-I GOT AN IDEA.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.122
I COULD SHOOT YOU WITH
A TRANQUILIZING DART.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.492
OKAY.

20:59.526 --> 21:02.161
BUT THIS TIME, PROMISE
NOT TO DRAW ON MY FACE?

21:02.194 --> 21:05.197
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T KEEP
THAT PROMISE.
(gunshot)
