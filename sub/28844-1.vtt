is we already have a casino.

12:29.793 --> 12:32.379
It would seem to me improving it
makes much more sense

12:32.448 --> 12:35.000
than building one 90 miles
off the reservation.

12:35.068 --> 12:39.034
- Our reservation
is not a destination--

to destinations.

12:53.827 --> 12:55.551

12:55.620 --> 12:58.103
- It won't be off-site.

12:58.172 --> 13:01.000
We will own the land.

13:01.068 --> 13:04.862
And once we do, we annex it
into the reservation.

13:04.931 --> 13:06.068
- Can we do that?

13:06.137 --> 13:07.827
- The precedent's already set.

13:07.896 --> 13:12.275

in Santa Ynez.

13:12.344 --> 13:15.931

hotels, restaurant.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.931
With no state oversight.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.827
Because it's part
of the reservation.

13:20.896 --> 13:23.793

for the loan.

13:27.827 --> 13:29.344

13:42.965 --> 13:45.000
Someone is doing it to them.

13:45.068 --> 13:47.517
This is where change begins.

is gonna help the community.

13:57.172 --> 13:59.137
Just your promise it will.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.068
And promises are how
we got on the reservation

14:01.137 --> 14:03.758
in the first place.

14:03.827 --> 14:07.103
- Trusting them is what
put us on reservations.

14:07.172 --> 14:10.758
And I don't trust them.

14:10.827 --> 14:13.310
- You don't get my vote.

14:16.034 --> 14:17.655

14:25.448 --> 14:26.758
I don't need it.

14:28.551 --> 14:30.068

15:00.000 --> 15:02.137

15:02.206 --> 15:04.655
So how can I help?

15:04.724 --> 15:07.172
- I've reconsidered.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.206
The job you offered.
I've reconsidered.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.103
- Uh...

15:11.172 --> 15:14.103
The money we earmarked for that
Native American Studies program

15:14.172 --> 15:16.620
was re-allocated
until next semester

15:16.689 --> 15:18.413
when we can find a professor.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.068

to leave the school

with one less teacher.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.862
You were pretty firm on that,
if I recall.

15:25.931 --> 15:27.517
- I'm not leaving.

15:27.586 --> 15:28.965
What I mean is: I want both.

15:29.034 --> 15:30.655

at the high school,

15:30.724 --> 15:33.034
and afternoons or evenings
here at the university.

15:33.103 --> 15:36.862
- That's a full plate,
and a long drive.

15:36.931 --> 15:38.206
- I'm aware of that.

15:40.551 --> 15:43.137
- I have a class--
American History.

15:43.206 --> 15:44.896
It needs a professor.

15:44.965 --> 15:47.827
That gets you in the door
until we can get your classes

15:47.896 --> 15:49.241
on the fall schedule.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.827
- What era of American History.

15:51.896 --> 15:55.275
- Columbus's arrival to the
Declaration of Independence.

15:55.344 --> 15:57.482
- Columbus.

15:57.551 --> 15:59.206
- Are you comfortable with that?
- Depends.

15:59.275 --> 16:02.172
Which version of Columbus's
history am I teaching?

16:02.241 --> 16:04.344
- Yours, Mrs. Dutton.

16:04.413 --> 16:09.103
- Long.
My last name is Long.

16:09.172 --> 16:10.862
It used to be "Long Spear,"

16:10.931 --> 16:13.344

was taken from his parents

16:13.413 --> 16:14.758

16:14.827 --> 16:16.689

of Indian Affairs,

16:16.758 --> 16:18.068
where they changed his name

16:18.137 --> 16:20.482
and tried to teach him
how not to be Indian.

16:23.689 --> 16:25.586
I look forward to teaching young
minds all about the man

16:25.655 --> 16:27.896
who introduced genocide
to the Western Hemisphere.

16:56.068 --> 16:57.413
- Whew.

16:57.482 --> 16:59.310
My part of Montana you can
stand on a can of tuna

16:59.379 --> 17:01.275
and see the entire state
from there.

17:01.344 --> 17:03.862
- Not here.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.413
- I'm very curious to learn
what I can do for you.

17:05.482 --> 17:09.068
- Oh I think it's
what we can do for you.

17:09.137 --> 17:11.000
Come inside.

17:15.275 --> 17:16.931
Here.

17:20.586 --> 17:24.723
- We're looking
at three candidates to support.

17:24.792 --> 17:28.000
And wanted to gauge your
interest.

17:29.655 --> 17:34.103

17:34.172 --> 17:36.448
I have to ask: why aren't you
supporting your son?

17:36.517 --> 17:39.000
- Clearly you haven't met him.

17:39.068 --> 17:40.172
- We want what's best
for Montana.

17:40.241 --> 17:41.896
And right now, that...

17:41.965 --> 17:43.620

17:45.275 --> 17:46.758

17:46.827 --> 17:48.482
the wounded veterans
charity you started.

17:48.551 --> 17:51.655
- We save horses from
slaughterhouses in Canada

17:51.724 --> 17:53.448
and use them for equine therapy

17:53.517 --> 17:56.965

suffering from PTSD.

Be hard for either side
to argue against.

18:04.206 --> 18:07.965
- I'm late.
I gotta go, Daddy. Love you.

18:08.034 --> 18:10.310
- Don't change the hair.

18:13.379 --> 18:16.068
- I'm a little worried I won't
get the voter turnout.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.931
I'm from eastern Montana,
towns with 600 people,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.551
not a lot of voters there.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.344
- You let me worry about votes.

18:22.413 --> 18:25.068
You just worry about being you.

Shit. We're all cowboys.

19:16.896 --> 19:19.275

Stand up and tell me
I can't cowboy.

19:35.137 --> 19:36.586

19:36.655 --> 19:38.517
I said he can't.

19:38.586 --> 19:41.689
And he sure as hell can't.

19:41.758 --> 19:43.931
And you don't want
me standing up, boy.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.689
I'll beat you
like a rented mule.

19:50.482 --> 19:55.241

on this ranch, Cowboy.

19:55.310 --> 19:57.448
If you wanna fight somebody,

19:57.517 --> 19:58.931
you fight me.

You might wanna think

21:32.482 --> 21:34.344
Just the ranch name
that changes.

21:34.413 --> 21:36.793

You can't keep me from him.

keep you from him,

23:45.482 --> 23:50.241
I just have to shield him
from what you've done.

23:50.310 --> 23:52.758

25:30.689 --> 25:32.862
- So, what's your first move?

25:32.931 --> 25:34.896
- You've got these land
developers like Jenkins.

25:34.965 --> 25:37.137
They find pristine
recreational property,

25:37.206 --> 25:39.482
build McMansions,
and sell the dream.

25:39.551 --> 25:41.758
Some, like Jenkins,
they take it further,

25:41.827 --> 25:43.482
build hotels, subdivisions.

25:43.551 --> 25:45.517
But they all leave
with their tails tucked

25:45.586 --> 25:46.827
because they don't
have the cash flow

25:46.896 --> 25:48.793
to make a real business
out of land.

25:48.862 --> 25:50.103
- You do that in town.

25:50.172 --> 25:52.275
- Or you do this--
we set up a fund.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.068
That fund buys land,

25:54.137 --> 25:55.896
puts the land
in a conservation easement

25:55.965 --> 25:58.379
which cuts the property tax
by two-thirds,

25:58.448 --> 26:00.655
then we go to the Department
of Agriculture,

26:00.724 --> 26:02.862
and we enroll the land in a CRP.

26:02.931 --> 26:04.413
- What the hell is CRP?

26:04.482 --> 26:07.103
- It's the federal government
paying us not to farm it.

26:07.172 --> 26:08.172
- Why would they do that?

26:08.241 --> 26:10.482
- To control the supply, Bob.

26:10.551 --> 26:12.034
That way they
don't have to worry

26:12.103 --> 26:13.793

diluting the market.

26:13.862 --> 26:14.931
It's pretty fucking shitty.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.310
But it's great for us.

26:16.379 --> 26:19.103
The government pay per acre,
per year.

26:19.172 --> 26:20.137
- How much?

26:20.206 --> 26:21.448
- Depends on the land.

26:21.517 --> 26:22.689
Around here?

26:22.758 --> 26:25.172
Could be 3-400 dollars an acre.

26:25.241 --> 26:28.068
The government paid off the land
for us in 7 years.

26:28.137 --> 26:31.862
We become landlords
who get paid not to rent.

26:33.517 --> 26:36.034
- Sounds like a pyramid scheme.

26:36.103 --> 26:38.413
- With the government
at the bottom.

26:38.482 --> 26:41.206
We start with a 100 million
dollar investment in land.

26:41.275 --> 26:44.413
We funnel the CRP funds into
more land purchases.

26:44.482 --> 26:48.103
We can buy roughly
50 thousand acres per year

26:48.172 --> 26:51.620
without spending a dime.

26:51.689 --> 26:53.965
We are profitable
by the end of year two

26:54.034 --> 26:56.862
with a net revenue
of 46 million per year.

26:56.931 --> 27:00.551
The more land we buy,
the more that number grows.

27:01.758 --> 27:03.689
- Why hasn't anyone
done this before?

27:03.758 --> 27:05.862
- Because they can't
afford the two years.

27:05.931 --> 27:08.689
They don't have the investment
infrastructure.

27:32.379 --> 27:36.379

the skin with you.

27:36.448 --> 27:39.931

27:40.000 --> 27:42.068

a 200 square mile moat

27:42.137 --> 27:43.758

27:51.517 --> 27:53.931

into the hedge fund.

Use the brokers
to buy up the land.

42:43.517 --> 42:44.724

what's going on.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.620

He gets a local and that's it.

medical experience?
