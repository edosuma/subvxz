WEBVTT

00:37.320 --> 00:39.039
<i>My name is Alvin Stanton.</i>

00:39.200 --> 00:41.874
I'm the U.S. Attorney
for the District of Columbia.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.269
Spare me the introductions.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.314
I expect this to be a long day
and I'm not getting any younger.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.830
You know why you're here?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.358
To tell you what I know so you can judge
if my truthful testimony merits immunity.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.911
There are allegations that the FBI
allowed Raymond Reddington...

00:56.080 --> 00:57.912
...to continue to commit crimes...

00:58.120 --> 01:00.077
...while acting as a criminal informant.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.276
That's a fact.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.638
He has continued to commit crimes
including murder.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.474
The task force led by Harold Cooper.
They knew about this?

01:07.640 --> 01:09.074
Yes, and I can prove it.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.560
I gave Agent Gale the bodies.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.916
I can give you locations and dates that
the bodies were collected and buried.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.954
Okay, Ms. Nemec,
we'll offer you immunity.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.875
I need a day to get my affairs in order
without a protective detail.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.475
- No.
- It's not a request, it's my offer.

01:28.640 --> 01:32.793
If you think you can prove this case
without me, feel free to pass.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.713
Anyone?

01:37.640 --> 01:41.759
Okay, gotta run.
As I said, I'm not getting any younger.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.120
- You're asking me to protect Kaplan.
- From Reddington.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.953
Wouldn't be good if he got to her.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.952
When you
authorized Reddington's deal...

02:00.120 --> 02:02.840
...you knew we had to let him maintain
his criminal empire.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.719
That's what makes him valuable to us.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.837
You're a big boy, Harold.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.960
You knew we'd support you as long as
you kept the deal hidden. You didn't.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.510
- My people could go to jail.
- You've done good work.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.673
Grand jury hands up an indictment,
the judge and jury will agree.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.639
If we don't go to jail,
does the Bureau take us back?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.315
When it's over,
where do we get our reputations back?

02:22.480 --> 02:23.709
I wish I knew.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.037
Aram won't testify against us.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.429
They gave him immunity.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.193
But how did they know to do that?

02:32.360 --> 02:35.319
Gale only knew about us, not Aram.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.035
I can't protect you.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.112
It's my job to do that and I can't do it.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.873
We're here because of Reddington.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.600
Because he shot Kaplan
for trying to help you.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.197
And that's indefensible. He says
he wants to protect us and I believe him.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.239
Maybe I didn't make myself clear:
we're going to be arrested.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.239
There's nothing Reddington can do
to protect us against that.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.352
To be honest,
that makes me the angriest.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.352
That here we are, at the end...

02:59.000 --> 03:02.311
...and we still don't know why
he walked into your life that day.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.990
Where are you going?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.911
To do something
I should've done a long time ago.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.078
Once Kaplan testifies,
an indictment is inevitable.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.833
Cooper tried to shut it down.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.231
Harold has to work within the system.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.880
Henry Prescott does not.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.440
Who's Henry Prescott?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.478
A man who knows
how to bury problems.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.754
If you find yourself up against
impossible odds due to poor judgement...

03:26.920 --> 03:29.071
<i>...Henry Prescott's
who you want on speed dial.</i>

03:29.240 --> 03:30.640
<i>He's the courage you never had.</i>

03:31.200 --> 03:32.873
Cool head in a crisis.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.874
Like you said,
you and your husband fought.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.954
When he left the apartment,
he was drunk and depressed.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.600
You had no idea
he was headed for the roof.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.876
The roof?

03:51.480 --> 03:55.076
Finding him is the key
to sweeping the grand jury under the rug.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.510
Weren't you squatting
in a congressman's apartment?

03:58.680 --> 04:00.080
The House is back in session.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.351
And those are the charred remains
of 16 false identities...

04:04.520 --> 04:07.877
...that Kate
has somehow compromised.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.271
At the moment, my resources are scant.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.352
Which is why
I need help finding Prescott.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.519
Why? How can a fixer-for-hire
derail a grand jury?

04:16.920 --> 04:21.072
Four years ago,
I surrendered to protect you...

04:21.279 --> 04:22.999
...from Tom...

04:23.200 --> 04:24.190
...Berlin...

04:24.520 --> 04:26.910
...the Cabal.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.830
And now you may go to jail
because of me.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.517
<i>It appears Kate may be right after all.</i>

04:33.400 --> 04:36.791
<i>Maybe I am the person
you need protection from.</i>

04:37.000 --> 04:38.832
<i>Prescott. Do you have any leads?</i>

04:44.160 --> 04:47.995
The lead on Prescott, Warren Casualty, it
has no physical address, only a P.O. Box.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.439
Reddington said it's a front Prescott uses
to hide his clients and launder funds.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.314
The address was a bust. Corporate
tax returns tell a different story.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.911
In the last three years, the company's
reported 17 million in earnings...

04:59.080 --> 05:00.400
...from various sources including...

05:00.560 --> 05:03.917
Banish Capital, an investment firm
owned by one Jay-Jay Brickman.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.480
The football player?

05:08.240 --> 05:11.278
Reddington, I think we've found a way
for you to get to Prescott.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.114
Check it out. We're gonna have
an aquarium behind the bar.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.431
Seven thousand gallons or something.
Crazy big.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.071
- For fish.
- No, not for fish. For the ladies.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.709
- Gonna have them done up as mermaids.
- Mermaids?

05:22.920 --> 05:25.560
Really? You're not in Miami anymore.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.910
Who the hell are you?

05:27.080 --> 05:31.233
Someone who knows better than to
mix themes in an entertainment venue.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.160
Get this chump out of here.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.394
- What do you want?
- Oh, that's a long list.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.950
But at the moment,
I'll settle for Henry Prescott.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.071
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- Let me ring it for you.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.160
A few months ago, you were tweaking on
whatever you were tweaking on...

05:51.320 --> 05:55.394
...at that night club in Vegas. And
inadvertently discharged your handgun...

05:55.560 --> 05:58.075
...in the general direction
of a crowded dance floor.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.278
Sending a Belgian tourist
to the emergency room.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.672
Henry Prescott is the man
who made that all go away.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.994
Let go of my friend, please.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.198
If I knew the man you were talking about,
and I'm not saying I do...

06:12.360 --> 06:14.591
...I'd only call him if I had a problem.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.240
- A real problem.
- Yes.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.830
There. There's a problem.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.710
Your drug dealer's bleeding out
on the floor in your VIP room...

06:26.880 --> 06:28.633
...of your new night club.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.760
With the morals clause in your
new contract, you won't collect a penny.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.313
Henry Prescott.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.030
Call him.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.713
A moment.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.514
This is pretty Jurassic.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.273
I was told it was still here.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.516
Guess it should be.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.354
Just go on right over there.

07:08.440 --> 07:13.640
4-7-5-6-8-2-6-B.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.118
Knock yourself out.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.871
I did my best.
I don't know how long he'll last.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.918
I hear gurgling noises
when he breathes.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.230
You did fine, Jay-Jay.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.954
I'm gonna transport your associate
to a private clinic.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.833
You need to tell me what happened.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.918
I happened.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.350
Who's this?

08:03.520 --> 08:04.636
Look, I don't even know.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.430
Came here looking for you. Next thing
I know, he's shooting up the place.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.796
You confirmed
you were my client to a stranger?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.997
The man has a gun in his hand.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.435
Hell yeah, I confirmed.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.320
My apologies for the forced
introduction, Mr. Prescott...

08:17.480 --> 08:19.631
...but I require some information.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.316
On November 19th, 2015...

08:23.520 --> 08:27.639
...your services were engaged
to pick up a package in Dupont Circle.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.032
I need you to tell me
the exact disposition of that package.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.198
I don't need to tell you anything.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.275
Oh, come now.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.029
If you don't give me the information
I requested, it'll all be over.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.635
- What are you gonna do, shoot me?
- I don't have to.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.874
To be effective, people like you
must operate from the shadows.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.680
Anonymity and discretion
are your stock and trade.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.395
And I'm about to make you famous.

08:53.560 --> 08:57.793
Once you, Jay-Jay, and Gunshot Wound
here make the headlines tomorrow...

08:57.960 --> 09:00.429
...your phone will never ring again.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.395
Or you can tell me
what I need to know.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.796
Where's the package?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.515
This is a mistake.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.830
Hey, you'll be fine.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.151
All you have to do
is answer their questions.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.438
If you don't, you'll be held in contempt.
You'll go to prison.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.750
Agent Mojtabai.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.790
You're up.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.439
- I do.
- Sir, please state your name...

09:33.600 --> 09:36.559
...and occupation for the grand jury.

09:37.360 --> 09:41.149
Aram Mojtabai, and I am an FBI agent.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.039
You're an agent with a task force...

09:43.200 --> 09:46.637
...created to work with a criminal
informant named Raymond Reddington.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.393
Yeah.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.155
I'm... I'm not really supposed to talk
about my work.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.635
So...

09:52.800 --> 09:55.872
We've heard testimony your task force
has allowed Reddington...

09:56.040 --> 09:59.033
...to commit violent crimes
and done nothing to stop it.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.515
Stop, Mr. Reddington.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.919
Well, if you knew him,
you'd know that's basically impossible...

10:04.120 --> 10:08.558
So you knew he was committing crimes
while he was serving as your informant.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.076
- Didn't say that.
- You weren't able to control him.

10:11.240 --> 10:16.793
Newton Phillips, Alistair Pitt, Milos Pavel
Kinsky a.k.a. Berlin, Diane Fowler.

10:16.960 --> 10:20.874
All people Reddington murdered
while working with you, correct?

10:22.800 --> 10:27.079
Agent Mojtabai, the grand jury
has subpoenaed your testimony.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.397
You have immunity.
Nothing you say can incriminate you...

10:31.560 --> 10:35.031
...so you can be compelled to answer.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.513
Okay, you know what? Fine.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.478
I'm proud of the work with Reddington.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.191
Yeah, I'm proud of it. You heard me.
Yes, his world is terrifying.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.430
- We're done.
- It exists.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.592
- You're excused.
- The only reason we know...

10:47.760 --> 10:50.958
- Hold him in contempt...
- ...is he takes down the worst people in it.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.998
...while I get a warrant for his arrest.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.197
- Get up.
- Do you know how we have to do that?

10:55.360 --> 10:56.999
We make choices. Write that down.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.392
You wanna put us on trial?
Give us a trial. Let us present a defense.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.994
We'll see what happens then.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.514
I told you this was a mistake.

11:13.960 --> 11:14.950
That Prescott?

11:15.120 --> 11:19.239
Yes, he has something
I think you'll find of particular interest.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.074
Mr. Prescott,
my associate Frank Sturgin.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.158
I'll need him to confirm the findings.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.239
It's organized by date.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.120
What is this place?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.397
A depository of sorts.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.439
Prescott's insurance policies.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.830
We're looking for 11-19-15.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.436
You'll want these.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.438
And here we are.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.636
This of particular interest to me?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.950
I'm certain of it.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.069
Ready?

12:14.160 --> 12:15.150
Dive in.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.794
Mother of God.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.874
Congratulations, Donald.
Your hunt for Reven Wright is over.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.677
- Please tell me you're here to get him out.
- I can't do that. No one can.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.594
He'll remain here until he testifies,
which he won't do.

12:54.760 --> 12:58.231
- Oh, come on. There's gotta be...
- You saw an opportunity and you took it.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.076
- Can we please just focus on Aram?
- I'm doing that. That's why I'm here.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.596
- To tell him the truth about you.
- About me?

13:04.800 --> 13:07.031
What did you get for giving him up?

13:07.800 --> 13:09.917
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.517
I got a warrant for your car's navigation
system to see where you've been.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.717
Guess what,
you've been at the courthouse...

13:15.880 --> 13:19.920
- ...on the same days as the grand jury.
- I was subpoenaed to testify.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.276
I didn't tell Aram
because I wasn't allowed to.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.831
Aram wasn't allowed to either,
and yet, he told us.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.520
They told me if I cooperated
they would expunge my criminal record.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.389
A second chance I couldn't pass up.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.120
Can you honestly tell me
you would've done differently?

13:36.720 --> 13:38.518
Yes, I can.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.480
Hey.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.790
You did the right thing.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.156
I know
it doesn't seem like it right now...

13:49.320 --> 13:50.595
...but you did.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.274
I'm totally freaking out in here.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.797
And I'm half Muslim,
which is definitely...

13:55.960 --> 13:57.633
...not a plus.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.917
I'm sorry. What can I do?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.709
Nothing, it's...

14:04.040 --> 14:05.156
Thank you, it's fine.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.193
What is it?

14:13.480 --> 14:16.075
Look, Janet's been amazing.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.152
You hate her.
I didn't wanna say this...

14:18.320 --> 14:20.551
...but the fact is
I'm barely hanging on in here.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.110
And if it wasn't for her...

14:28.800 --> 14:32.510
Not that it matters because Mr. Kaplan
is gonna testify tomorrow afternoon.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.758
And when she does there's...

14:39.760 --> 14:41.877
There's nothing I can do
to protect you.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.511
Reddington has a lead. An angle
he thinks might get you out of here.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.957
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- Yeah, that was it. What he's doing.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.119
And I fed your turtle.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.714
Really?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.758
That's...

14:58.280 --> 15:00.476
That's incredibly thoughtful.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.110
Hang in there, okay?

16:05.640 --> 16:07.996
I'm sorry, Katarina.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.677
You wanted to see me?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.831
I know it's hard to believe, but I was a...

16:23.040 --> 16:24.793
...golden boy once.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.275
Fresh out of the Navy.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.954
Youngest agent ever appointed...

16:28.120 --> 16:32.353
...to the Pentagon's combined
investigation and intelligence task force.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.036
At the time, Reddington was stationed
overseas working counter-intelligence.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.190
You worked together.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.354
He was shadowing a Russian operative,
codename Sea Duke.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.313
So that's why he surrendered to you.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.432
Sea Duke made Reddington.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.798
He dispatched
a team of Spetsnaz to abduct him.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.838
For 10 days they tortured him...

16:51.000 --> 16:54.357
...until he was rescued by
an FBI-SEAL joint task force.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.318
I was working lead on the agency side.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.517
My job
was to secure the physical evidence...

16:58.680 --> 17:01.593
...in the event that Sea Duke
was captured and prosecuted.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.793
I'm sorry.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.199
Why are you telling me this?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.396
Because I meant what I said.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.873
I'm angry that you still don't know why
Reddington walked into your life.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.029
The blood on this shirt,
from Raymond Reddington...

17:18.200 --> 17:21.271
...has been sealed in an evidence locker
for over three decades.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.478
I procured a sample
and submitted it for a DNA profile.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.960
Yours was already on file.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.840
Procured a sample
of Reddington's blood?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.351
From evidence?

17:32.520 --> 17:33.749
That's tampering.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.036
Yes.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.994
And I should've done it
the day he surrendered.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.272
I submitted the sample and your profile
to a private lab.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.399
They'll have the results within 24 hours...

17:44.560 --> 17:48.759
...so you'll finally know whether or not
Raymond Reddington is your father.

17:56.720 --> 18:00.475
Female victim. Apparent cause of death:
mid-range gunshot wound.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.118
No stippling present.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.597
The body
appears to have been preserved...

18:05.760 --> 18:10.755
...through full immersion
in a formaldehyde-phenyl bath.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.718
The straw in the wind.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.076
Ballistics will match this
to Hitchin's weapon.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.197
Yes, proving her guilt.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.955
You get Prescott,
he gives us Reven Wright...

18:29.120 --> 18:31.760
...her body gives us that bullet,
bullet gets us Hitchin.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.872
Who has the power
to derail a grand jury.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.192
If we provide her
with the proper motivation.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.751
I'm sorry, Donald. I know you've been
longing to prove Hitchin's guilt...

18:40.920 --> 18:43.958
...but the only way to survive
now that you have that proof...

18:44.120 --> 18:45.918
...is to trade it away.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.594
You know how
I know Hitchin was the killer?

18:52.120 --> 18:53.873
Tommy Markin.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.680
He was the man
who killed my father and got away with it.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.320
I told Reven that story.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.598
Told her
that's the reason why I became a cop.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.071
To prevent other Tommy Markins
from getting away with murder.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.115
She was the only one I told
and then she's killed...

19:08.440 --> 19:10.671
...and Hitchin asked me
to look into a suspect.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.230
Tommy Markin, the man who got away.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.909
It was like...

19:15.080 --> 19:17.549
...Reven was sending me a message
through her killer...

19:17.760 --> 19:19.911
- ...begging me to solve this case.
- And we have.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.116
But Reddington's right.

19:22.280 --> 19:26.320
We either all go free,
or we all go to jail.

19:37.400 --> 19:42.600
<i>Bus number 348 from Pittsburgh
now arriving at door number two.</i>

19:48.280 --> 19:51.432
<i>- Elizabeth.
- Mr. Kaplan.</i>

19:51.600 --> 19:53.353
Please don't do this.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.598
Raymond has left me no choice.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.877
Let's meet. Just you and me.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.312
I can no longer trust you.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.480
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.674
But I have every reason to trust you.

20:13.800 --> 20:18.397
Well, if it isn't America's most wanted
and Deputy Dawg.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.076
I thought you were on administrative
leave, not cavorting with criminals.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.555
Donald doesn't cavort.

20:23.720 --> 20:28.511
In fact, I think you'll find our little
meeting today rather serious in tone.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.793
Is that right?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.471
Say something, Agent Ressler.
You don't look well.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.316
There's a federal grand jury investigating
whether Donald and his task force...

20:38.480 --> 20:40.995
...have been enabling me
to continue to commit crimes.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.879
My. It sounds like a problem.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.317
It seems inevitable that my immunity
agreement will be revoked...

20:46.480 --> 20:50.076
...and the members of the task force
will be indicted forthwith.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.600
Well, jeez, fellas.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.638
I'm so sorry to hear that.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.837
Fortunately,
our problem is your problem.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.400
Yeah? And why is that?

20:58.560 --> 21:00.358
I can't do this. I...

21:00.520 --> 21:02.512
As you can see, Laurel,
Donald's upset...

21:02.880 --> 21:05.759
...and what has him wound tighter
than a two-dollar watch?

21:05.920 --> 21:08.560
His impending indictment? No.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.315
It's this:

21:11.480 --> 21:15.360
A slug the medical examiner
just pulled out of Reven Wright's body.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.957
You and I both know Ballistics
will match it to the Glock 19...

21:19.120 --> 21:21.271
...in your nightstand,
and as I understand it...

21:21.440 --> 21:24.000
...Agent Ressler has a team
standing by as we speak...

21:24.160 --> 21:27.039
...ready to enter your home
and seize the firearm.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.396
You're bluffing.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.310
Tragically, Reven Wright's body
was never found.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.235
Until today.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.517
Until Henry Prescott,
the cleaner you hired...

21:37.680 --> 21:41.435
...to dispose of Reven's body like
a piece of garbage, took us right to her.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.434
Let's give Prescott a call
so you can hear for yourself.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.274
With that bullet, Donald has
what he's been looking for...

21:47.440 --> 21:48.715
...since you killed Reven:

21:49.440 --> 21:52.080
Irrefutable proof.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.193
I'm listening.

21:55.800 --> 21:59.191
We hand over the slug,
and you make that grand jury go away.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.914
That's not easy.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.880
I see.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.111
Then we've wasted your time and ours.

22:06.280 --> 22:10.160
I do wonder what else Donald's men
will find in your nightstand.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.277
Are you a vibrator kind of gal, Laurel?

22:12.440 --> 22:14.079
We'll see.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.316
If I do this...

22:17.520 --> 22:20.957
...you don't mention me and Reven
Wright in the same sentence again.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.270
Say it.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.596
- Deal.
- Not you.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.030
Him.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.830
Boy Scouts don't give up
their merit badges easily.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.992
How do I know
you're gonna hold up your end?

22:32.320 --> 22:34.357
I give you my word.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.956
Mr. Kaplan would like to see you.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.913
Ms. Hitchin. What are you doing here?

23:00.080 --> 23:02.470
The question is what the hell
are you doing here?

23:02.640 --> 23:04.597
Conducting a grand jury investigation.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.879
You're investigating the FBI's relationship
to Raymond Reddington here?

23:09.040 --> 23:11.953
What the hell are you thinking?
Do you have...

23:12.160 --> 23:14.231
- Who's this?
- I'm Special Agent Julian Gale.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.120
Are you? Well, you may not be
for long, Agent Gale.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.320
Reddington's supposed deal with the FBI
is a matter of national security.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.518
The testimony you're taking
touches on highly sensitive matters...

23:24.680 --> 23:27.991
...that go beyond what anyone
in this room should hear, including you.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.994
- Is that so, because...
- This investigation is over.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.150
Sorry.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.596
I want this case closed
and all records expunged.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.798
Get the court reporters'
transcriptions and any exhibits.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.713
What's he got on you?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.710
Must be good.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.277
- Excuse me?
- So it's true.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.116
Reddington can corrupt
just about anybody.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.276
Keep talking, Agent Gale. Please.
Your entire career's not over just yet.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.638
Make sure you destroy
what little you have left.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.518
- Kaplan.
- The grand jury investigation was closed.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.512
<i>The whole damn case,
it was withdrawn.</i>

24:08.680 --> 24:10.000
<i>- Withdrawn?
- Yes.</i>

24:10.160 --> 24:12.675
Withdrawn by National Security
Advisor Laurel Hitchin.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.309
- It's a cover-up.
- What about my immunity agreement?

24:15.480 --> 24:16.470
<i>It's gone.</i>

24:16.680 --> 24:18.433
<i>The deal was you testify...</i>

24:18.640 --> 24:21.917
...then you get immunity.
Now that that's off the table, you...

24:27.040 --> 24:28.360
Yes, ma'am?

24:32.320 --> 24:34.312
Hands on the wheel.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.280
Julian.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.160
It's been a long time. You look fit.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.319
Jumping jacks?

24:45.480 --> 24:46.630
Hitchin.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.230
You got to her.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.710
When was the last time
you and I saw each other?

24:50.920 --> 24:53.071
London? No.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.159
Cape Town? No, that's not right.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.154
Don't tell me. It'll come.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.991
How? Did you bribe her?

25:02.560 --> 25:04.995
As a matter of fact, I did.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.431
Anyhoo, Mr. Kaplan.
I need to know how to reach her.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.795
Yeah.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.520
- Good luck with that.
- She uses burner phones.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.399
You must have her latest number.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.472
So, what are you gonna do?

25:18.640 --> 25:19.676
Kill me?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.911
No. I'm gonna take your phone.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.353
Ho Chi Minh City, that's it.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.592
I got away from you
aboard that catfish trawler...

25:28.760 --> 25:32.037
...on the Saigon River.
My God, the humidity.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.157
But fun times indeed.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.391
More to come, Agent Gale.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.960
More to come.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.712
Hitchin did it. We're in the clear.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.552
- Which means so is she.
- And Aram?

25:47.720 --> 25:50.076
He was in contempt of a jury
that no longer exists.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.118
Where's Keen?
She needs to hear this.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.950
- Your plan worked.
- I'll give you a cell number I need traced.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.270
Did you hear me?

25:58.440 --> 26:00.830
I haven't been able to reach Elizabeth.
Is she there?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.275
No. Who's the number for?

26:02.440 --> 26:03.669
<i>Kaplan's burner.</i>

26:03.840 --> 26:07.197
If we find it we find her,
and, I think, Agent Keen.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.113
She doubted my plan, Harold.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.671
<i>- I believe she had another one in mind.
- A direct appeal to Kaplan.</i>

26:12.880 --> 26:15.349
<i>Who was relying on the grand jury
to separate us.</i>

26:15.520 --> 26:18.558
<i>I fear Kaplan's backup plan
will be more extreme.</i>

26:18.760 --> 26:20.956
<i>The number. Give it to me.</i>

26:26.560 --> 26:28.472
Mr. Kaplan?

26:29.920 --> 26:31.513
Hello?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.118
Are you okay?

27:04.040 --> 27:06.999
I swore an oath to your mother
I would protect you with my life.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.197
I fear I failed you.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.991
What are you talking about?

27:14.240 --> 27:16.914
We're at the end now and I'm...

27:18.760 --> 27:20.479
...lost.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.919
Tired.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.873
I don't know how to keep you safe.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.074
You don't have to keep me safe.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.633
This could be over.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.593
It could stop.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.669
Masha...

27:43.840 --> 27:46.309
...I could show you the truth.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.833
What truth?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.550
If you want to know
why he came into your life...

27:57.720 --> 27:59.712
You're scaring me.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.520
I can take you. We can go together.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.354
But it has to be your choice.

28:19.120 --> 28:23.797
We have a location. Virginia State
Highway 501, just south of Brookneal.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.634
<i>- We're rolling out.
- We need to take 501 North.</i>

28:26.800 --> 28:29.190
We're closer. Keep us updated.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.275
Kate, where are we going?

28:33.480 --> 28:35.119
I loved Raymond.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.712
And your mother.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.397
I loved her too.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.000
The secret...

28:43.600 --> 28:45.592
...what Reddington's hiding from me...

28:46.640 --> 28:47.835
...I think I know...

29:21.360 --> 29:23.511
If you get out of the car,
you choose Raymond.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.515
If you stay, you choose the truth.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.994
Kate, get out of the car.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.719
Turn the engine off, Kate.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.797
- Baz.
- Please, Kate.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.792
Turn it off and get out of the car.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.800
Baz? Oh, my God.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.235
I need an ambulance. Highway 501.

30:42.720 --> 30:43.756
Hello, Kate.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.876
Raymond.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.799
Clever use of Laurel Hitchin
to commandeer the grand jury.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.237
Critical oversight on my part.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.677
You're so focused on destroying me,
you're willing to hurt...

30:56.840 --> 30:59.480
...one of the few people
you've ever loved.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.189
You're right.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.240
I was so focused on you I didn't see
that getting you away from her...

31:05.400 --> 31:06.880
...is unnecessary.

31:07.480 --> 31:10.120
All I have to do is give her the truth.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.433
I don't know what that means.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.630
Our secret at Tansi Farms.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.596
What have you done?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.035
I have it, Raymond.

31:21.520 --> 31:25.070
I went there and I dug it up
and I'm gonna give it to her.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.432
I need a perimeter at the one-mile mark
and patrol boats.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.833
Communications go through command,
which we're establishing on the east end.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.717
Look around you, Kate. It's over.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.357
Do you honestly believe
I didn't consider this moment?

31:49.520 --> 31:51.796
Anticipate the possibility of prison?

31:51.960 --> 31:53.474
I don't see what choice you have.

31:53.680 --> 31:57.310
I made a promise to Elizabeth's mother
to protect her girl at all costs...

31:57.480 --> 31:59.392
...and I can't do that from a cell...

31:59.920 --> 32:03.152
...which is why
I have a contingency plan.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.592
Isn't that what you
taught me, Raymond?

32:06.240 --> 32:08.471
Always make contingencies.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.430
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. We gotta get out there.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.115
- Absolutely not.
- No, we can't wait. We gotta help her.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.396
He's gonna kill her.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.438
We both know why you're here:

32:21.600 --> 32:24.672
To finish what you couldn't months ago.
To put a bullet in my head.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.112
That's the moment I've anticipated.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.796
Shoot me dead, and when you do
my confidante will be alerted...

32:30.960 --> 32:34.351
...and Elizabeth will be given
our secret from Tansi Farms.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.634
There's one flaw in your plan, Kate.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.394
I'm not gonna hurt you.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.671
I never should have pulled that trigger.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.150
I certainly won't now. Not again.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.672
I'm not going to prison, Raymond.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.309
Pull the trigger. Release the truth.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.630
I won't.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.120
Then I will.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.395
I loved you, Raymond.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.074
Kate!

32:58.400 --> 32:59.914
No!

33:30.880 --> 33:32.599
Thank you.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.393
I'm so sorry.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.756
I didn't think I had a choice.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.151
They said they were gonna
revoke my immunity...

33:42.320 --> 33:45.392
...if I didn't cooperate.
They threatened me, so I...

33:45.560 --> 33:47.472
...gave you up.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.436
I'm sorry. You what?

33:51.160 --> 33:54.597
When I testified for the grand jury...

33:54.800 --> 33:56.154
Hang on, didn't...

33:57.280 --> 33:59.351
Didn't Samar tell you?

34:00.280 --> 34:04.877
I asked Harold if he would mind
if I delivered this to you personally.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.675
I wanted you to know how much
I respect your dedication.

34:08.520 --> 34:13.356
I also want to make sure you understand
your place in this marriage.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.830
You do what I want when I want it.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.474
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen...
- That's exactly what's gonna happen.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.672
- Don't pee standing up in my house...
- Stop.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.592
- Donald...
- Stop!

34:45.840 --> 34:47.956
- Have a moment?
- Yeah.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.033
I'll give you some privacy.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.638
I ran his DNA two weeks after we met.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.155
We were undercover in Montreal
having dinner, and...

35:14.320 --> 35:18.109
...he said that everything I thought
I knew about myself was a lie.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.155
It was intimate and weird.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.676
When we thought we were made
he snuck out the back.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.877
I palmed his Scotch glass.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.231
But when the envelope came back,
I was...

35:29.400 --> 35:33.553
...scared it would confirm
the devil was my father.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.712
I didn't look at it.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.756
Threw it away.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.950
Elizabeth, I'm sorry.
If you don't want to know...

35:43.160 --> 35:44.674
Mr. Kaplan was my nanny.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.873
Somehow I'm not surprised.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.434
She loved you so much.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.671
And now she's gone...

35:54.600 --> 35:56.557
...just like Sam...

35:59.560 --> 36:01.233
...and my mom.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.110
Everyone who knew me best...

36:04.280 --> 36:07.591
...who knew the answers
about who I was...

36:07.760 --> 36:09.797
...where I came from.

36:20.480 --> 36:23.678
I hope you get the answer
you're looking for.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.429
Agent Mojtabai.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.553
Good to have you back. Well done.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.713
Thank you, sir. That means a lot.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.079
You got out.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.470
When you came to see me in jail...

37:15.200 --> 37:18.159
...why didn't you tell me Janet
was the reason I was in there?

37:19.120 --> 37:21.635
Because I saw
that she was making you happy.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.752
You seemed...

37:45.240 --> 37:47.755
You should be going, Mr. Sturgin.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.510
You lied to me.

38:22.040 --> 38:25.112
The day we met,
you asked how I got my scar.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.519
I told you my father gave it to me.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.152
But you knew that already, didn't you?

38:35.920 --> 38:37.320
What was that you said?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.597
A father who was a career criminal...

38:40.760 --> 38:43.798
...and a mother who died
of weakness and shame.

38:48.920 --> 38:52.038
Why didn't you just tell me
who you were?

38:52.400 --> 38:54.790
Why keep it a secret?

38:55.160 --> 38:56.992
Come into my life, give up everything...

38:57.160 --> 39:01.040
...go broke trying
to protect me and not...

39:01.200 --> 39:04.034
...tell me you're my father?

39:05.840 --> 39:09.390
"Broke" is such a harsh word.
I prefer "illiquid."

39:11.600 --> 39:14.911
What was so awful
that you withheld the answer...

39:15.120 --> 39:18.830
...to the question I've been wondering
my entire life?

39:23.080 --> 39:25.959
Were you afraid I'd turn out like you?

39:26.760 --> 39:28.558
Because guess what...

39:29.280 --> 39:31.317
...I am like you.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.040
All those times you asked me
to think like a criminal...

39:36.440 --> 39:40.116
...was it a test to see
how naturally it came to me?

39:46.440 --> 39:48.432
Because it did...

39:48.600 --> 39:50.557
...come naturally.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.877
And that terrifies me.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.551
Elizabeth, if you need to walk away...

39:59.720 --> 40:01.279
Walk away?

40:01.440 --> 40:03.033
Are you serious?

40:04.160 --> 40:07.198
How can you be so smart
and so clueless?

40:08.080 --> 40:09.560
Yes, I'm terrified. I'm angry.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.717
I'm angry at you, at who I am...

40:11.880 --> 40:16.352
...the fact that I want to help you despite
everything you did to me and yourself.

40:18.080 --> 40:22.233
But anger and fear...

40:23.000 --> 40:25.595
...and a certain amount of hatred...

40:27.040 --> 40:30.750
...are all normal in a family.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.189
And that's what we are.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.994
And I'm not gonna walk away
from that.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.840
<i>- You didn't deny it?
- I didn't.</i>

41:02.000 --> 41:04.799
<i>Then she thinks that's Kate's secret.</i>

41:05.480 --> 41:06.596
Yes.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.594
So she doesn't know
about the suitcase.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.760
Not yet.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.592
It is gone.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.475
Raymond...

41:27.120 --> 41:29.396
...I'm not sure Elizabeth
will ever be ready...

41:29.560 --> 41:32.837
...to learn about what you did
to Katarina.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.474
We gotta find that goddamn suitcase.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.271
Hey. I got it.

42:07.640 --> 42:10.599
Mr. Kaplan's instructions
were very specific.

42:11.640 --> 42:12.869
I'm on my way.
