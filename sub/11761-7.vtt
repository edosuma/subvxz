<i>Previously on</i> Camelot...

00:02.789 --> 00:06.495
There are forces in this world
which must be satisfied

00:06.562 --> 00:09.923
if they are to be kept at bay.

00:09.991 --> 00:13.359
Let's see what's truly
in your heart, brother.

00:13.427 --> 00:15.465
May you live
knowing only the truth

00:15.533 --> 00:17.034
of undying love.

00:17.102 --> 00:21.600
What happens now? Between us?
I committed myself.

00:24.068 --> 00:26.516
I did nothing to harm you.

00:26.541 --> 00:28.878
You did nothing when
my father banished me.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.434
Just give thanks
you're leaving here alive.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.969
We are truly content,
and rejoice in Arthur's rule.

00:34.036 --> 00:36.202
As do I.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.674
...I can get close to Arthur
and kill him.

00:39.742 --> 00:41.676
- But then what?
- And then I take the crown,

00:41.744 --> 00:43.576
which is rightfully mine.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.944
I will not be
challenged!

Oh...

03:30.319 --> 03:32.854
Take those downstairs and then
go and assist Sybil.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.456
Yes, my lady.

03:36.392 --> 03:38.360
Do you enjoy
the view?

03:41.831 --> 03:43.765
Lady.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.601
Please, I beg you.

03:45.668 --> 03:47.636
What were you doing

03:47.703 --> 03:51.639
with that hand before you
used it to sully my dress?

03:54.676 --> 03:57.077
My lady,
I love you.

03:57.145 --> 04:01.848
Do you?

04:01.916 --> 04:04.017
This is
how you prove it?

04:06.987 --> 04:09.721
I'll do anything.

04:09.789 --> 04:11.356
Anything.

04:15.829 --> 04:17.363
Come with me.

04:31.746 --> 04:34.682
Tell her your name.

04:34.749 --> 04:36.817
Harwel.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.119
And what have you
offered me, Harwel?

04:41.021 --> 04:43.122
Whatever you wish
of me.

04:45.125 --> 04:48.160
Get him prepared.

04:48.228 --> 04:50.196
Is everything else ready?

04:50.263 --> 04:52.031
Yes.

04:52.099 --> 04:54.067
You're sure
that Arthur will come?

04:54.134 --> 04:57.737
His bastard's heart craves
a family.

04:57.805 --> 04:59.906
And what am I,
if not family?

04:59.974 --> 05:03.410
What better way
to get inside his head?

05:03.478 --> 05:07.315
Double salt the meat
and bring out the strongest ale.

05:07.383 --> 05:11.119
- Yes, my lady.
- I want them thirsty and drunk.

05:11.187 --> 05:13.922
We'll prove to Arthur
just how loyal

05:13.990 --> 05:16.191
and devoted we are.

05:21.097 --> 05:23.498
Morgan was allied with the man
who killed both our parents.

05:23.566 --> 05:24.867
But now we're
the best of friends?

05:24.879 --> 05:26.355
She warned us of his attack.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.056
Without her, we could have
all died.

05:28.737 --> 05:32.173
I'm warning you.
A feast at her castle is a risk.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.810
And as your brother, I'm telling you,
some wounds have to heal.

05:35.878 --> 05:40.215
Besides, I've already broken bread
with her and lived to tell the tale.

05:40.283 --> 05:42.184
What do you think?

05:42.251 --> 05:45.721
I think it's a marvellous idea.
I'm looking forward to it.

05:45.789 --> 05:47.890
If Merlin's not worried,
I'm not worried.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.926
If we don't go,
I can't work out what Morgan's

05:49.994 --> 05:52.429
up to. Besides,
I miss the old place,

05:52.497 --> 05:55.599
and a feast will
do us all good.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.135
Camelot might have a library
and an armoury,

05:58.202 --> 06:00.237
but we haven't got a table
to sit at.

06:00.304 --> 06:02.739
- So we leave it undefended?
- We've recruited.

06:02.806 --> 06:06.042
Gawain's trained them.
We don't lack good soldiers.

06:06.110 --> 06:07.510
Just ale.

06:07.578 --> 06:09.612
And Castle Pendragon has
plenty of that.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.814
Let's get a move on
before it's all been drunk!

06:11.882 --> 06:14.417
Yah!

06:37.077 --> 06:40.980
- Welcome, my king.
- Your brother.

06:41.047 --> 06:44.150
Thank you
for inviting us.

06:44.217 --> 06:47.286
Come lad,
help with the horses.

06:49.256 --> 06:52.591
- Lady Igraine.
- Get the water.

06:54.828 --> 06:57.763
Must bring back memories.

06:57.831 --> 07:00.399
I'm sorry for the way
that you le
