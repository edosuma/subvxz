00:01.869 --> 00:03.314
Thank you very much.

00:03.469 --> 00:04.710
Thank you and congratulations

00:04.872 --> 00:07.478
for being part of this
huge crowd today.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.556
They tell us ifs
not another Vietnam

00:11.712 --> 00:13.851
and then they wheel out
Henry Kissinger

00:14.014 --> 00:15.857
to tell us about it.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.189
Henry Kissinger!

00:19.186 --> 00:20.256
If it's not another Vietnam,

00:20.420 --> 00:22.593
why would they bring
Henry Kissinger?

00:22.756 --> 00:26.169
What, was Goebbels
not available that day?

00:27.561 --> 00:29.541
Goering wasn't around?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.334
Bring out Kissinger.

00:31.498 --> 00:32.841
And he talks like
he's really saying'

00:33.000 --> 00:34.445
"We must very careful

00:34.601 --> 00:36.512
or war will be averted. "

00:39.506 --> 00:40.541
Unlike the U.S. Government,

00:40.707 --> 00:42.516
I've never supported
Saddam Hussein.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.747
Nor have I supported
the Shah of Iran,

00:44.912 --> 00:46.448

01:32.259 --> 01:36.799
- Everything about him
was honest and true,

01:36.964 --> 01:38.409
and there was no bullshit.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.670
There was no...

01:40.834 --> 01:43.178
No fake anything.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.682
- Oh, Barry Crimmins,
oh my God.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.582
Who's Barry? Barry who?

01:49.743 --> 01:50.915
He was a guy...

01:51.078 --> 01:53.854
who you heard about
before you actually saw him.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.654
This whispered-about presence.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.922
I never met anyone like him.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.656
- I went to Kentucky...
I got into a big hassle.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.665
I got caught smuggling
books into Kentucky.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.006
Got off on a technicality.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.200
No one could prove
they were books.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.673
- Barry Crimmins was this
weird mythical force

02:18.839 --> 02:24.118
that was a judgmental
sage of some kind that'

02:24.277 --> 02:25.847
you know,
I didn't quite get.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.687
- You know, in the 80s
and 90s there was, like,

02:28.849 --> 02:31.523
this wave of comedy that was...
the truth teller.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.325
And I feel like people
should claim him more.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.490
Because I think he has
much more of an influence

02:36.657 --> 02:39.570
than anybody realizes.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.502
Gruff, smart, annoying...

02:42.663 --> 02:44.870
Like, invasive.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.239
- You know, Barry
should have been a super,

02:47.401 --> 02:50.644
super, superstar, I suppose,
if this was a just world.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.876
- I was always very aware of
this name and this presence of,

02:54.041 --> 02:57.215
"If you really want to see
somebody go to the edge,

02:57.377 --> 02:58.651
you gotta go look
for Barry Crimmins. "

02:58.812 --> 03:00.416
But he wasn't
putting albums out'

03:00.580 --> 03:03.060
the internet wasn't there yet.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.992
- He had integrity,
you know, and he would...

03:06.153 --> 03:07.564
He was a man of his word.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.496
But he was,
he was a nut job!

03:09.656 --> 03:10.691
- Hold on a second.
Watch...

03:10.857 --> 03:12.530
Watch the kind
of stuff I can do here.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.832
Listen, I'm sick of
listening to you yell.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.566
I'm making a TV show here,
okay?

03:17.731 --> 03:18.766
And you're yelling.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.344
Just get out.
I don't like you.

03:21.501 --> 03:22.411
<i>He's like a, you know.</i>

03:22.569 --> 03:24.571
Like a guy in a John Ford
movie, you know?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.719
He's just this combination
of sort of anger

03:27.874 --> 03:30.047
and sentimentality,
you know?

03:30.210 --> 03:33.714
Which, you know, makes him
fascinating but difficult.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.123
- He would rip politicians,
he would rip musicians.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.594
Everything was fair
game in his eyes.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.460
- He's like a combination
of Ambrose Bierce

03:41.621 --> 03:43.623
and Charles Manson,
if you're just looking at him.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.896
Will Rogers and Mark Twain.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.301
- Audie Murphy
and Abby Hoffman.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.636
- He looks a lot like
Fidel Castro.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.745
Noam Chomsky and Bluto.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.076
- Everybody should just
treat each other well...

04:02.242 --> 04:04.620
Because there's a
lot of pain out there.

04:04.778 --> 04:08.624
And comedy has nothing to
do with alleviating it.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.228
It's just a distraction, man.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.954
- I knew that he
was a troubled guy'

04:13.120 --> 04:14.724
that things were
not easy for him.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.492
They didn't seem
easy for him ever.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.432
When he was around he was
always kind of nervous

04:19.593 --> 04:21.163
and seemed fragile
in a way.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.432
But volatile.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.839
- There's always so many people
around making noise and stuff.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.570
You never know
what to do, really'

04:28.735 --> 04:31.443
because your senses are
constantly assaulted.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.017
And your senses are being
assaulted right now by me

04:34.174 --> 04:37.280
because you're watching me
on some electric thing.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.254
And it's making us weird.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.093
- His fuse was getting
shorter and shorter.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.493
- Fuck you.
Fuck your family.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.326
Fucking nine-year-old kid's
giving me shit about politics.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.165
Blow me, all right'?

04:54.327 --> 04:56.102
But that wasn't the issue.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.834
He has demons,
Barry, you know'?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.842
- I didn't know, I didn't
know what made him tick.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.503
But that's the way he was.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.205
But I think...

05:04.371 --> 05:06.783
There was a lot of personal
things that happened in his life

05:06.940 --> 05:10.615
when he was young
that came out later.

05:11.278 --> 05:11.983
This is...

05:12.145 --> 05:13.681
Obviously I'm
talking about Barry,

05:13.847 --> 05:16.885
and you're Barry's sister and...

05:17.050 --> 05:18.996
I don't know what's going on.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.361
If you want to tell me,
this would be the time.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.922
God damn it!

05:53.086 --> 05:58.332
- He lives in a nice house,
nice stone fireplace.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.166
Surrounded by trees
in a very wooded area

06:02.329 --> 06:03.433
<i>m upstate New York.</i>

06:03.597 --> 06:07.010
Wide open fields.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.204
Gorgeous nature.

06:09.369 --> 06:14.614
- He is away from society'
show business,

06:14.774 --> 06:18.244
Wal-Mart,
Top 40 radio, you know'?

06:18.411 --> 06:19.617
He's like a wizard.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.555
You know, he lives,
he lives in the woods.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.855
- I think it's good for
him up there, too.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.123
Chopping the wood.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.698
It gives him a good outlet.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.799
It's a lifestyle.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.867
When you're 30 ifs okay

06:32.025 --> 06:34.562
but at a certain age you
start to get arthritis,

06:34.728 --> 06:36.867
you want a dental plan,
you know?

06:37.030 --> 06:40.034
- I've been a mechanic
for about 30 years

06:40.200 --> 06:41.702
and that's how I
got to meet Barry.

06:41.868 --> 06:44.246
I was working on his cars
and snowplowing for him,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.782
and he always told me
these things that he's done

06:46.940 --> 06:48.783
and I've never believed him.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.944
I usually don't let my
customers be my friends

06:51.111 --> 06:52.818
to a point where they
come to my house

06:52.979 --> 06:54.720
but Barry kinda
broke through that.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.452
- He's the finest person
I've ever met in my life.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.493
Bottom line.

06:58.652 --> 07:02.225
- It's funny,
the contrast of where he is

07:02.389 --> 07:04.665
and commenting on what's
happening in the world

07:04.824 --> 07:07.430
is funny in itself.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.905
It's like if Thoreau
could have a computer.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.813
Yeah, fuck this plan.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.758
Well, there's a couple of things
I really still feel

07:26.913 --> 07:28.324
I have to accomplish,

07:28.481 --> 07:31.860
and if I do I think I'll be
able to put my little tile

07:32.018 --> 07:34.521
in the grand mosaic of life.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.168
And those two things are,
of course,

07:37.324 --> 07:40.305
I'd like to overthrow the
government of the United States'

07:40.460 --> 07:43.339
and I'd like to close
the Catholic church.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.649
- In a lot of ways I think
Barry is his own worst enemy

07:54.808 --> 07:56.549
when n comes to ms career.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.383
He's rarely had an agent.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.024
He can be incredibly stubborn.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.488
He doesn't like to delegate.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.628
He has a hard time
trusting others.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.387
So if you add all that up

08:05.552 --> 08:09.796
and it's not a good mix
for career advancement.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.999
- Would you welcome now,
in any condition,

08:17.163 --> 08:19.200
Barry Crimmins.
Bar.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.488
- Been on sort of a
health kick lately.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.259
Lotta wars going on
right now.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.919
I think cable TV
should pick up on it.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.087
Start a cable war network.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.731
All war, all the time.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.744
- To take Barry and put him
in between Jeff Dunham

08:54.901 --> 08:58.906
<i>and a guy doing
MC Harmer yokes...</i>

08:59.072 --> 09:02.019
It was a very stark difference.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.711
It wasn't exactly profitable

09:03.877 --> 09:06.585
to be doing really
harsh politi...

09:06.746 --> 09:09.283
It was probably doing
fun political stuff.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.895
"Quayle's an idiot,
Reagan's kind of", you know...

09:12.052 --> 09:13.759
But he was, you know,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.264
almost he was edging into
Noam Chomsky territory,

09:16.423 --> 09:18.869
but doing it in front
of a neon, you know,

09:19.025 --> 09:20.095
thing of Charlie Chaplin

09:20.260 --> 09:22.035
with people drinking
blender drinks.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.970
- They're talking about putting
Reagan on Mount Rushmore.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.131
Wow, huh?

09:25.298 --> 09:26.572
If they do that we'll have
to raise a bunch of money

09:26.733 --> 09:28.906
to buy Lincoln and
Jefferson blindfolds.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.976
If they're going to honor him
they're going to put him on

09:32.138 --> 09:33.913
the million dollar bill.

09:36.109 --> 09:36.917
This way all his friends

09:37.077 --> 09:39.216
will have something
to remember him by.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.723
Oh, that HUD scandal
was nothing.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.232
They created homelessness
and got paid extra for it,

09:49.389 --> 09:51.596
and I'm the jerk for
pointing it out, excuse me.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.431
Sorry America at home, too.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.335
Those of you that
still have one. Okay.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.170
- Before like a lot of
these guys like Bill Maher,

09:59.332 --> 10:01.005
Jon Stewart, he was like
one of the first guys

10:01.167 --> 10:03.272
that really would nail
that kind of thing.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.143
So he was the always...

10:05.305 --> 10:06.477
"I know you like Bill Hicks

10:06.639 --> 10:08.778
but you gotta go find
Barry Crimmins. "

10:08.942 --> 10:11.013
- One of the questions I've
always wondered about Barry

10:11.177 --> 10:12.520
is how does he
make any money'?

10:12.679 --> 10:14.158
You know?

10:15.415 --> 10:16.621
And I dare say this.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.423
If you don't know anything about
the lineage of Boston comedy

10:19.586 --> 10:21.122
this place would not exist

10:21.287 --> 10:23.164
if this guy didn't start
where he started

10:23.323 --> 10:24.768
way back in the 80s.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.336
He's a nice man,
he's a gentleman'

10:27.494 --> 10:28.632
he's a funny man.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.797
He's one of the best
performers working today.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.944
Please welcome
Mr. Barry Crimmins.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.635
Give him a nice
round of applause.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.802
Barry Crimmins.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.843
- I became a vegetarian
a long time ago.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.450
You know what happened,
I was...

10:40.607 --> 10:44.111
I was eating a chicken leg which
was a bone with meat on it,

10:44.277 --> 10:45.551
and I was holding it
with my hand,

10:45.712 --> 10:48.852
which was a bone
with meat on it.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.456
My name's Barry Crimmins

10:53.620 --> 10:57.124
and I'm from Skaneateles,
fucking New York.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.637
- Barry's childhood.
Take 1 A&B count, mark.

11:01.060 --> 11:04.041
- Okay, this is my
childhood home. 27 Sta...

11:04.197 --> 11:06.302
- Barry, turn over the other shoulder...
- Okay.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.843
- This is...
- It's this one, right'?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.912
- It's this one.
- It's the brown one'?

11:10.069 --> 11:11.343
- We've got the wrong
house framed up.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.142
Are you fucking kidding me'?

11:13.306 --> 11:14.683
- Well, this is my
childhood home.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.219
27 State Street.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.017
Centrally located in
Skaneateles, New York.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.922
Skaneateles is an Indian
word that means

11:23.082 --> 11:26.495
"beautiful lake
surrounded by fascists. "

11:26.653 --> 11:29.896
It's spelled
S- K-A-N-E-A-T-E-L-E-S.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.263
And when you can do that
you're in the second grade.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.836
It's changed over the years.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.202
A lot of the fascists have died.
New people have moved in.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.604
- My father was the only
Democrat in the damn town.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.541
That's the truth.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.510
- You know,
while we only have one

11:43.670 --> 11:46.082
24 hour Christmas
ornaments shop,

11:46.239 --> 11:48.446
but there's, you know,
15 or 16 others

11:48.608 --> 11:51.054
and they have a Dickens
festival at Christmas,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.588
even though most of
the people in town

11:52.745 --> 11:55.191
that I grew up in would
have rooted for Scrooge.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.520
I come to my high
school reunion.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.390
I went to my 20th
high school reunion

11:58.551 --> 12:01.395
because I was on TV and stuff
quite a bit around then.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.556
But then a couple of the boys
pulled me aside and they said

12:03.723 --> 12:04.701
"Grimmer.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.770
We gotta give you a chance
to clear your name. "

12:07.927 --> 12:09.201
And I go, "About what?"

12:09.362 --> 12:10.864
"We heard when you
were over in Boston

12:11.030 --> 12:12.907
you done an AIDS benefit.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.875
Now this isn't true, is it?"

12:15.034 --> 12:17.810
"Yeah, I've done dozens
of AIDS benefits. "

12:17.971 --> 12:20.247
"Well, you're not a
queer, are you?"

12:20.406 --> 12:22.079
I'm whatever threatens you.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.483
I'm a Communist
with AIDS and I bite.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.419
He hated school...

12:26.579 --> 12:28.923
but he was a genius
in my mind.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.755
- You know, and he
was probably smarter

12:30.917 --> 12:32.624
then any of the
teachers in there.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.492
What's your rules of work?

12:34.654 --> 12:38.101
- My rules of work are simple.
A to Z gravity.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.431
In other words,
the worst first.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.973
And in my case...
childhood was the worst.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.475
- He was born in Kingston,
New York,

12:47.634 --> 12:49.978
which was the first
capital of New York.

12:50.136 --> 12:54.516
On July 3rd so he was
almost a firecracker but...

12:54.674 --> 12:58.121
On the 3rd of July
in Skaneateles

12:58.278 --> 13:00.758
they have flares that they
plant around the lake.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.291
And Barry for years thought
it was for his birthday

13:03.449 --> 13:06.794
because it was the 3rd of July.
That was kind of fun.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.423
I didn't have to put
too much out on his cake.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.694
This is my brother,

13:11.858 --> 13:13.963
my only brother
and my biggest brother.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.663
He's big, yes.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.637
Everything was funny to Barry.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.209
I mean, the news
was funny to Barry.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.039
- Oh, he had a great
relationship with his father.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.010
His father was very humorous.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.480
And he'd say to me.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.175
"I had some good jokes
to give him.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.979
Barry didn't want them. "

13:30.343 --> 13:31.845
My mother,

13:32.011 --> 13:35.322
we'd be leaning in and,
you know, lecturing

13:35.481 --> 13:37.392
and my brother would
talk back to her

13:37.550 --> 13:39.552
in a voice like John Wayne.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.126
My mother... and we would
just crack up, you know'?

13:43.289 --> 13:45.895
Because it's my younger
brother talking to...

13:46.059 --> 13:48.869
"Get ahold of yourself, mom. "

13:49.028 --> 13:51.008
- And we rode around all
day in the back roads,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.337
smoking cigars
and drinking beers.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.979
- Yeah, we went down
to Watkins Glen.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.173
H was 1973.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.986
Grateful Dead playing,

14:04.143 --> 14:07.488
The Band
and The Allman Brothers.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.593
So, you know,
we get there the first night.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.229
We're camping out in tents.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.332
Huge thunderstorm comes up.

14:18.891 --> 14:22.498
Crimmins is all of a
sudden out of the tent

14:22.662 --> 14:25.438
with an umbrella,
looking for something.

14:25.598 --> 14:29.068
You know, a beer or something,
you know? Whatever.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.509
I happen to be looking,
peeking out of my tent

14:32.672 --> 14:34.379
right at the same time.

14:34.540 --> 14:38.716
All of a sudden this frigging
lightning bolt comes down.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.257
Just fries the friggin umbrella,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.725
Goes off into everywhere.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.794
He told me he was on acid.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.523
Probably... well, yeah.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.476
Crimmins is, like,
running around going, like,

15:01.634 --> 15:04.240
"Wow, did you see that?"

15:07.807 --> 15:09.946
Anybody else would
have been fried.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.953
- It was a good,
centrally located place

15:13.112 --> 15:14.955
for an idyllic childhood.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.957
Except unfortunately
the Catholic church

15:17.116 --> 15:19.960
was only three blocks up there.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.991
- You know, we grew up in
those years Catholic.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.468
Being taken to church
every Sunday.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.099
Barry was always going
to church really early

15:32.265 --> 15:34.336
in the morning
before everybody else.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.913
It was almost like Barry
was a servant of the church.

15:43.309 --> 15:47.758
- There's these early morning
services in all churches,

15:47.914 --> 15:51.259
ostensibly because priests
are supposed to say

15:51.417 --> 15:52.521
a mass every day.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.255
It's, like, apparently
some sort of, like,

15:54.420 --> 15:57.128
milking a cow thing,
I don't know.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.928
There was this priest,
Father Neary,

15:59.091 --> 16:01.697
who hated me and
I couldn't figure out why

16:01.861 --> 16:05.104
'cause I was a sincere kid
trying to do my job.

16:05.264 --> 16:09.679
But early on Neary
gave me the old

16:09.836 --> 16:11.281
pedophile shoulder rub thing.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.041
He started that.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.482
And I just hit him with an
elbow. it was a reflex.

16:15.641 --> 16:19.817
And so I get stuck serving mass
with this monster every day.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.617
And he was really scary.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.124
He looked like
Christopher Lee,

16:23.282 --> 16:26.388
the guy who played Dracula.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.494
I would come in
through the basement

16:28.654 --> 16:31.658
<i>and I would creep in
and be as quiet as possible</i>

16:31.824 --> 16:34.065
because he was terrifying.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.299
And there he would always
be sitting in this chair,

16:37.463 --> 16:42.208
and the stained glass would
be bathing him in this eerie

16:42.368 --> 16:45.076
green and blue and red.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.048
And I would be on the altar

16:48.207 --> 16:50.517
and I would pour the water
to wash his hands

16:50.676 --> 16:53.179
and he would go,
"Are you trying to drown me?"

16:53.346 --> 16:55.917
I would ring the bell.
"You know we don't need...

16:56.082 --> 16:58.995
you're not working with
the fire department. "

16:59.151 --> 17:02.394
Every day,
he just made my life miserable.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.728
He tried to get me into
his car a couple of times.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.030
"You wanna go get an
ice cream?" No thanks.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.702
- Yeah, we went to the same
high school in Skaneateles.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.403
He was a couple of
years ahead of me.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.070
Big jock.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.944
He just came up to me
one day and just goes,

17:20.106 --> 17:22.882
"Listen, I'm doing a comedy
thing over at Under the Stone. "

17:23.041 --> 17:24.919
I remember it so clearly,

17:25.077 --> 17:28.058
just walking into
that side door

17:28.214 --> 17:31.058
down underneath the restaurant.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.721
And, you know, I was in the
middle of a comedy act

17:34.887 --> 17:36.025
m Skaneateles. New York.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.135
- I don't know if ifs
the awful weather

17:39.292 --> 17:42.466
or what but there's
something about that area

17:42.628 --> 17:45.199
of Central New York
where people are just,

17:45.364 --> 17:47.275
just hilarious.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.470
And years later I was
reading this book about

17:49.635 --> 17:51.114
the Iroquois Indians'

17:51.270 --> 17:54.774
and apparently Ben Franklin
and Thomas Jefferson

17:54.941 --> 17:56.887
thought they were
fucking hilarious.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.420
So, yeah, there
was an ad, you know,

17:58.578 --> 18:02.720
"Comedians Wanted" for a
comedy open mic night happening.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.623
The ad did say.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.457
"Comedians Wanted,
Bear Cat"

18:06.619 --> 18:07.893
People called him Bear Cat.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.761
I don't know if he referred
to himself as Bear Cat

18:09.922 --> 18:11.094
tn the text of this ad.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.066
- Oh, n did in the ad.
- n did say n?

18:13.225 --> 18:15.000
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, okay. So guilty.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.664
- We did start calling
ourselves Bobcat and Tomcat,

18:17.830 --> 18:20.902
- directly kind of making fun of, making fun.
- As a spoof.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.071
I used to be a doctor,

18:24.236 --> 18:27.683
but now I'm

18:27.840 --> 18:30.821
- I was 16,
you were 15 I think.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.320
- We were in
high school anyway.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.118
High school knuckleheads.
How old was Barry then?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.420
He was in his...

18:37.583 --> 18:40.530
maybe like 26 or 27
when we met him.

18:40.686 --> 18:41.419
Yeah.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.991
So you know Barry would be
calling and my mother was,

18:44.156 --> 18:48.263
you know, understandably curious
and a little nervous like...

18:48.427 --> 18:51.033
- Yeah, yeah.
- "Who is this Barry Crimmins?"

18:51.197 --> 18:54.872
"He runs the comedy show
at the Old Stone Mill... "

18:55.034 --> 18:57.139
"What's he doing
calling here?"

18:57.303 --> 19:00.648
"He wants to talk about
the comedy show. "

19:00.806 --> 19:02.945
<i>'How OK! is he?"</i>

19:03.109 --> 19:08.183
"I don't know... 40? 45'?
I don't know. "

19:08.347 --> 19:09.826
He always seemed
like an old guy.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.826
You talked me into
doing comedy.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.362
"Hey, you're funny,
you know what I mean?"

19:14.520 --> 19:15.999
Ah, I don't know.
You were always Bob

19:16.155 --> 19:17.862
"Full Steam Ahead"
Goldthwaite.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.231
And I'm Tom
"Let Us Not Be Hasty'

19:20.393 --> 19:22.395
Let's Weigh All The Options"
Kenny.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.973
You know, that whole night
and that experience, like,

19:25.131 --> 19:27.475
you know, going up and
then getting the validation

19:27.633 --> 19:29.306
of this guy Barry Crimmins,

19:29.468 --> 19:33.416
that did change the whole
course of my life, I think.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.415
- To see Barry in
this environment

19:35.574 --> 19:37.884
with the comedy
made sense.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.682
It was extremely funny.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.086
I mean, I laughed
to the point of tears.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.352
And he said to me,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.360
"I'm gonna make a living
at this if it kills me. "

19:46.519 --> 19:49.398
And that was shortly before
he left and came here,

19:49.555 --> 19:51.159
he came to Boston.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.364
He called me and goes,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.770
"I found the perfect spot.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.069
It's a Chinese restaurant

20:00.232 --> 20:02.212
that does country western line
dancing four nights a week.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.541
I'll be able to talk
him into anything. "

20:09.408 --> 20:10.944
- "I'm gonna start a
comedy club here.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.453
We're gonna make it
five days a week. "

20:12.611 --> 20:14.420
- He ran a club there that
everybody wanted to work.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.558
It was a great club.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.717
- Might have been the
best comedy club ever.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.456
- He saw the comedy
wave coming.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.531
- The Connection was
paying $15 bucks a set.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.690
Barry paid $20.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.097
Connection said,
"Okay, we'll pay $20."

20:26.258 --> 20:28.033
Barry paid $25.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.572
Connection went to $25,
Barry went to $30.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.300
And the next thing you know,
you're making $400 bucks

20:32.465 --> 20:33.773
on a Friday night.

20:33.933 --> 20:34.968
That was Barry.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.442
He recognized talent.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.412
He booked
Paula Poundstone over there.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.381
Sweeney and Lenny.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.486
- Bobcat Goldthwaite
was part of that.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.144
Kevin Meaney, Rogerson.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.381
Dennis Leary.

20:46.545 --> 20:50.823
- He basically spawned all
of these great humorists.

20:50.983 --> 20:54.089
It was a family, a real family,
not like a show biz family.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.561
It was fucking cool.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.632
- He knew something
was happening.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.997
- We didn't know what hit us
and it turned out to be

21:00.159 --> 21:03.663
the foundation of
comedy nationally.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.331
He would take the money,

21:05.498 --> 21:07.910
like, what I was being paid,
like, $30 bucks.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.774
He'd have it crunched up,
crunched up

21:09.935 --> 21:11.243
and he would throw it
on the floor.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.440
He'd just throw it on
the floor at my feet.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.984
He'd go, "There!"
Then he'd walk away.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.520
Jokingly,
like, you know'?

21:18.677 --> 21:21.351
Over and over.
Not just once.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.755
- Of all the
bigger-than-life characters,

21:23.916 --> 21:25.918
Crimmins was the biggest.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.826
And you could tell he was,
like, in charge.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.797
- He wasn't the most
successful comedian in Boston;

21:30.956 --> 21:33.300
he was, like,
the president of the scene.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.702
- He had become this guy
that you could go to

21:36.862 --> 21:39.365
and he understood your plight.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.478
He understood my comedy.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.773
Even though I didn't even
understand it myself.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.884
What's wrong with you people'?
God... my eye!

21:48.040 --> 21:52.318
- He just seemed to have extra
knowledge of stuff in general.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.857
So if he was giving you a
compliment comedy-wise,

21:56.015 --> 21:57.187
it was really...

21:57.349 --> 21:58.384
it felt good.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.191
- I mean, I remember we did
a Ding Ho reunion one time,

22:01.353 --> 22:04.232
and everyone was going on and on
about what a great guy Barry was

22:04.390 --> 22:06.028
and how he helped
me do this and,

22:06.192 --> 22:09.036
you know, I said, "Look,
I don't think Barry likes me.

22:09.195 --> 22:12.472
And, you know,
that's just the way it is. "

22:12.631 --> 22:15.475
And then afterwards for,
like, every time I saw him,

22:15.634 --> 22:16.806
"Yeah, I don't like you,"

22:16.969 --> 22:18.710
"Yeah I don't like you,
I don't like you,

22:18.871 --> 22:19.576
what are you gonna
do about it?"

22:19.738 --> 22:20.739
"I don't like you. "

22:20.906 --> 22:23.716
- And he was very
direct with comics.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.152
He had quality control
at the Ding Ho

22:26.312 --> 22:27.416
<i>m terms of who he booked.</i>

22:27.580 --> 22:31.528
- I love most of the
comedians that I work with.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.322
Almost every single
one of them.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.091
- The first time that I
performed at the Ding Ho,

22:36.255 --> 22:39.031
I brought about 40 friends
from the neighborhood.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.431
I was supposed to do
5 minutes.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.231
H ran about 24 minutes.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.736
I don't want to brag,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.434
I'm not trying to make
anyone feel uncomfortable,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.546
but two years ago
I went to Europe.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.340
Huh!

22:51.503 --> 22:53.505
Excellent country.

22:56.408 --> 22:57.785
I was an open micer

22:57.943 --> 23:01.356
and Crimmins is in the back
going, "That's Clark!"

23:01.513 --> 23:02.924
"That's Sweeney!"

23:03.082 --> 23:05.688
"Do your own shit, Tingle!"

23:05.851 --> 23:07.592
You know,
I was demoralized.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.562
And so he was saying
the next day,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.099
"You know, you really have
to go through your stuff

23:11.257 --> 23:12.895
with a fine-toothed comb

23:13.058 --> 23:16.062
to make sure it's not
derivative of other people. "

23:16.228 --> 23:19.539
I think that was the first time
I heard the word "derivative. "

23:19.698 --> 23:23.145
- You could tell straight away
that there were other comics

23:23.302 --> 23:25.213
who respected mm

23:25.371 --> 23:30.480
but were a little irritated by
their having to respect him.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.587
Does that make sense?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.587
I was really scared of him.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.726
He didn't have an
open demeanor.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.885
- I think the terror of
Barry Crimmins being mad

23:39.051 --> 23:40.223
made us funnier.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.592
- You know what else
made me mad this summer

23:41.754 --> 23:43.495
when we sold the
Statute of Liberty

23:43.656 --> 23:44.600
to huge corporations?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.998
I felt we could have fixed
that with our tax payer's money.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.661
I would... would you be
real indignant about that

23:48.827 --> 23:49.828
if they took tax money...

23:49.995 --> 23:51.770
What, you would say
"You took our hard-earned

23:51.931 --> 23:53.604
tax payer's dollars
and you fixed the goddamn

23:53.766 --> 23:55.302
Statute of Liberty'?

23:55.467 --> 23:58.107
Next thing you know you'll be
defending the Constitution. "

23:59.905 --> 24:01.907
They surrounded the Statue
of Liberty on its birthday

24:02.074 --> 24:03.985
with rich thugs in yachts.

24:04.143 --> 24:04.917
H's looking down and saying

24:05.077 --> 24:07.990
"I asked for huddled masses.
What is this?

24:08.147 --> 24:10.491
Who painted "Beatrice"
across my crown?"

24:11.650 --> 24:14.859
Liberty and justice for sale.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.431
I got sucked in.
I donated $100 bucks,

24:16.588 --> 24:19.535
they sent me a Statute
of Liberty tote bag.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.696
I use it to smuggle baby
Mexicans into the country.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.810
- Barry, are you going
to vote this year?

24:28.968 --> 24:30.811
- Yes, I already
voted in the primary

24:30.970 --> 24:32.506
and I will vote, certainly.

24:32.671 --> 24:36.710
- Ah, would you tell us
who you voted for?

24:36.875 --> 24:40.049
Um... no.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.486
...No?

24:42.514 --> 24:46.963
- He was a very lovable,
capable,

24:47.119 --> 24:48.359
straightforward comedian

24:48.520 --> 24:51.865
that was able to smuggle
stuff about authoritarianism

24:52.024 --> 24:55.836
and consumerism
into a seemingly

24:55.995 --> 24:57.338
middle of the road set

24:57.496 --> 24:59.737
that the audience would laugh
at and then it was too late,

24:59.898 --> 25:02.242
they'd already started
laughing at some pretty

25:02.401 --> 25:06.178
subversive, you know,
apocalypse-culture

25:06.338 --> 25:07.316
son of stuff.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.579
- Can you believe Exxon actually
called a press conference

25:10.743 --> 25:13.485
to tell us that they're going to
pass the cost of the oil spill

25:13.645 --> 25:16.091
along to us,
the consumers?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.023
No kidding.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.254
I was sure the vice presidents
at Exxon would have insisted

25:20.419 --> 25:22.729
on paying for the
entire affair.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.265
"No, no, no,
your money's no good here.

25:24.423 --> 25:26.733
Those otters are on me,
I've got those. "

25:28.560 --> 25:31.040
Did you hear what
the Chief of Staff

25:31.196 --> 25:34.837
for President Bush John Sununu
said about this oil spill?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.708
He said, "Hey, nobody ever
mentions how much oil

25:37.870 --> 25:40.214
didn't spill out
of the Valdez. "

25:41.874 --> 25:42.944
Once in a while you
need an up guy

25:43.108 --> 25:45.054
like John Sununu, you know?

25:45.210 --> 25:48.020
Is the tanker half-empty'?

25:48.180 --> 25:50.922
- I was always amazed that Barry
knew the stuff that he knew.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.359
Before the internet,
before CNN.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.430
I was like,
how do you know who

25:55.587 --> 25:57.533
the Defense Minister
in Syria is?

25:57.689 --> 25:58.963
How do you figure
that stuff out'?

25:59.124 --> 26:01.536
- I have to say,
I know when it was politics,

26:01.693 --> 26:04.037
like, on stage or
even hanging out'

26:04.196 --> 26:06.403
if he said something,
I would say that,

26:06.565 --> 26:08.977
two thirds of what
he's talking about

26:09.134 --> 26:10.545
I don't know what he means.

26:10.702 --> 26:14.240
- I love the new pope, too.
He's a wonderful man.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.407
He's a wonderful man.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.750
A leftist, according to his
PR man from Fox News,

26:19.912 --> 26:21.084
Greg Burke.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.281
Good man.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.394
Celibate-.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.052
Doesn't do a thing
with his penis,

26:26.218 --> 26:28.095
his dirty, dirty penis.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.635
And he's selled to us that
he's this progressive man who'

26:34.793 --> 26:38.434
who tells that we
should help out the poor.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.406
We should help them.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.239
We should help the poor...

26:42.401 --> 26:46.008
'cause God forbid the
church sell a fuckin' chalice.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.249
- I remember in the mid 80s,
seeing him,

26:51.410 --> 26:55.358
maybe before I even started,
you know, doing comedy.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.323
So he's smoking,
he's wearing a jacket,

26:57.483 --> 26:58.791
maybe a tie.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.363
He's got this afro
and his mustache.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.625
You know, he's greasing the
audience with some garbage

27:03.789 --> 27:05.268
about this and that.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.767
Then he does a few
political jokes

27:06.925 --> 27:08.927
and just sort of,
like, nothing.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.300
He's getting nothing.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.703
And he's exasperated.

27:12.865 --> 27:16.108
And then he just stops,
defeated and goes,

27:16.268 --> 27:20.375
"All right, there are three
branches of government... "

27:22.040 --> 27:23.849
And he starts a civics lesson.

27:24.009 --> 27:28.788
- I think to be a guy who takes
the world very seriously

27:28.947 --> 27:32.190
and is outraged by bullshit,

27:32.351 --> 27:34.331
to have been really
politically aware

27:34.486 --> 27:38.229
at the height of the mass
hypnosis of the Reagan era,

27:38.390 --> 27:42.839
must have been
acutely distressing.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.340
- Let's start with the part
that is the most controversial.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.535
A few months ago I told
the American people

27:48.700 --> 27:51.340
I did not trade arms
for hostages.

27:51.503 --> 27:55.076
My heart and my best intentions
still tell me that's true.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.653
But the facts and the
evidence tell me it is not.

27:58.810 --> 28:01.882
- Our international policies
under Reagan are great.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.424
Central American policies
are tremendous.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.926
If people are hungry,
kill them.

28:08.754 --> 28:11.496
- But this group of over
150 religious leaders,

28:11.657 --> 28:13.762
each baring crosses with
the names of people

28:13.926 --> 28:15.906
they say were killed
by Contras,

28:16.061 --> 28:18.905
was among those in Washington
vigorously opposing

28:19.064 --> 28:20.941
the president's proposal.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.238
- Well, you know, I had
been going to Nicaragua

28:23.402 --> 28:25.507
for the previous
three or four years.

28:25.671 --> 28:27.947
I was a big supporter
of the Sandinistas.

28:28.106 --> 28:31.713
Barry was very much on top of
what was going on down there.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.882
He had done a lot of material
about the Iran-Contra affair.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.550
- The President's so into
pulling boats into harbor

28:37.716 --> 28:39.195
I'm afraid he's going to pull
the boats into harbor

28:39.351 --> 28:40.694
in Nicaragua which
would be a big mistake

28:40.852 --> 28:42.195
'cause he mined that
three years ago

28:42.354 --> 28:44.061
and he's old and he forgets.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.463
- So he was the
perfect person to bring.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.697
- One of the finest political
satirists you will ever see.

28:49.861 --> 28:52.307
Would you please say hello
to Mr. Barry Crimmins.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.535
Barry?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.805
- What a tough summer its
been in the United States.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.380
We have this big presidential
election coming up.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.608
Of course the big problem
is someone will win.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.716
Just some rambling
notes from a guy

29:04.876 --> 29:07.413
kind a freaked out
in another land.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.286
The Contras, though,
from what I understand,

29:09.448 --> 29:11.587
I mean, they keep comparing
them to the founding fathers

29:11.750 --> 29:13.787
of the United States,
Thomas Jefferson and stuff.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.932
And from what I understand
they're cocaine dealers.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.726
I never read a quote
from Thomas Jefferson,

29:17.889 --> 29:19.891
"Come on in the men's room,
I'll tighten you up. "

29:21.159 --> 29:22.763
I thought I was just supposed
to say no to drugs...

29:22.928 --> 29:25.602
unless they're from the Contras,
then just say, "Si. "

29:25.764 --> 29:29.439
- He was loved down there.
People liked what he had to say.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.275
He, you know, gave the
whole group credibility.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.781
- I keep hearing about the
Contras, the freedom fighters.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.942
And I thought about it for a
while and I realized they are:

29:37.109 --> 29:38.588
some of them have been
fighting freedom for what,

29:38.744 --> 29:40.746
close to forty years now.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.483
Whenever it rears
its ugly head.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.831
They don't get that joke at
the comedy clubs in America.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.303
So I'm in Nicaragua

29:53.458 --> 29:57.133
and I'm in this field hospital
with all these kids.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.469
H's so hot'

29:59.631 --> 30:02.134
they're so uncomfortable'

30:02.301 --> 30:03.609
a lot of them with fresh wounds.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.442
You could see they're
wrapped up in gauze,

30:05.604 --> 30:06.708
and there's blood coming...

30:06.872 --> 30:09.375
I mean, it's, like,
really heavy.

30:09.541 --> 30:14.719
And every kid on one of
these cots has lost a limb.

30:15.881 --> 30:18.987
Lost an arm or a leg,
or whatever.

30:19.151 --> 30:23.497
And for whatever
reasons they said,

30:23.655 --> 30:26.534
"Okay, Barry,
you address this group. "

30:26.692 --> 30:30.538
So I tell them that
they're not my enemies,

30:30.696 --> 30:33.802
and what has happened to
them does not represent

30:33.965 --> 30:36.206
what an awful lot
of people I know,

30:36.368 --> 30:38.746
and have listened to what
I've had to say on stage

30:38.904 --> 30:42.579
and in public,
does not represent us.

30:42.741 --> 30:45.153
And I do not want
to harm children.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.314
I do not want to harm
babies who have...

30:48.480 --> 30:50.084
I do not want to harm you.

30:50.248 --> 30:51.591
You're beautiful

30:51.750 --> 30:55.562
and you've been... and my
country did this to you.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.861
And as someone who believes
in freedom this is what I do.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.436
I say this is wrong.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.334
And I oppose this.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.405
And I love you.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.668
And I hate fucking
Ronald Reagan

31:06.832 --> 31:11.212
and the fucking
bullshit PR campaign

31:11.370 --> 31:12.940
that this country is about.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.550
I fucking despise it.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.242
And I don't like to hate
and despise

31:16.408 --> 31:17.944
but I do cause it's crap

31:18.110 --> 31:21.091
and it kills and maims
and harms innocents.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.556
And there's tears
coming down the kid's faces.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.252
There's tears coming down
everybody's faces.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.898
And then I just said,
"That's all I got.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.295
I got nothing else to say. "

31:31.456 --> 31:34.096
And the applause starts.

31:38.764 --> 31:42.906
I have heard the sound
of one hand clapping.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.810
I've heard the sound
of one hand clapping

31:45.971 --> 31:49.612
and it haunts me,
stays with me my whole life.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.415
- Why don't you just ask me
what you most want to know'?

31:52.577 --> 31:55.080
I mean, he told me at one
stage of the game that,

31:55.247 --> 31:57.124
you know, someone might
call to interview me

31:57.282 --> 31:59.159
but nobody asked me
to be filmed.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.160
Okay?
You understand?

32:01.319 --> 32:04.766
And so, um, so when I
understand I'm being filmed

32:04.923 --> 32:06.402
then suddenly I'm thinking,

32:06.558 --> 32:10.597
oh, I think I'm being asked
to discuss something

32:10.762 --> 32:12.605
very intense.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.643
- Anybody who does any kind of
political humor runs into this.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.303
It's not for everybody.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.278
And so it's a hard thing
anyway,

32:19.438 --> 32:22.578
coupled with the fact of
personal experiences

32:22.741 --> 32:27.019
that are hurtful and
haven't been resolved.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.625
And in terms of drinking'

32:29.781 --> 32:31.124
was he trying to block
something out?

32:31.283 --> 32:31.849
I don't know.

32:31.850 --> 32:35.525
He would have to be the
one to diagnose that.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.035
- I don't think I've
ever seen Barry

32:48.200 --> 32:49.178
without a beer in his hand.

32:49.334 --> 32:52.281
I think that was,
you know, that was it.

32:52.437 --> 32:55.975
- I remember that distinctly,
watching him on stage and...

32:56.141 --> 32:58.178
First of all not believing
how much he could drink

32:58.343 --> 32:59.481
and go on stage.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.715
This isn't going to be enough,
by the way.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.456
- He's the hardest drinking
man who's not an alcoholic.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.358
We would do the show

33:07.519 --> 33:10.466
and after the show
the core would stay.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.322
We'd lock up.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.393
There are fights.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.901
And they were
behind the bar, like...

33:15.060 --> 33:16.869
the first thing I noticed
about the Boston scene

33:17.028 --> 33:19.065
is they had the keys
to the bar.

33:19.231 --> 33:23.839
This place is magic.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.482
And there's been
a lot of magic here.

33:26.638 --> 33:27.912
Kind of like that.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.143
When I was 19,

33:29.307 --> 33:32.151
I was at the other
club owner's party

33:32.310 --> 33:36.383
and I had been drinking
and then I took some acid.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.892
And I might have done
some coke that night,

33:39.050 --> 33:40.028
I don't know.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.858
I was a maniac.

33:45.590 --> 33:46.694
I was blacked out

33:46.858 --> 33:51.705
and I just ripped the
VCR off the television

33:51.863 --> 33:54.275
and threw it out the
window in a snow storm.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.879
I kind of just destroyed
the whole place.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.678
The next day I couldn't
have been less popular.

34:02.841 --> 34:05.287
Like, everybody
kind of abandoned me.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.548
I felt so alone.
I felt horrible.

34:07.712 --> 34:12.788
And Barry just reached
into his pants pocket

34:13.952 --> 34:16.023
and gave me a couple
hundred bucks and he said,

34:16.187 --> 34:17.393
"Why don't you go home

34:17.556 --> 34:22.096
and figure out what you're
going to do with your life. "

34:22.260 --> 34:25.764
And I've been sober ever since.

34:25.931 --> 34:29.378
- We left the Ding one
morning, about 5:30, 6,

34:29.534 --> 34:32.378
and we went to a place on
Mass Ave and it was closed,

34:32.536 --> 34:34.141
or we were there too early,
and I said,

34:34.306 --> 34:36.149
"Why don't we go to
Julia Child's house?"

34:36.308 --> 34:37.981
Welcome to The French Chef.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.645
I'm Julia Child.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.757
1-
This is a cheese souffle.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.654
- So we go down by the
river where she lived,

34:43.815 --> 34:44.759
and we pull in.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.418
Pull into Julia Child's
driveway.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.428
Get out of the car,
bang on the door.

34:48.587 --> 34:49.759
"Julia!
Wake up!

34:49.920 --> 34:51.661
Make us breakfast,
you fucking bitch!"

34:51.822 --> 34:52.563
And Crimmins is going'

34:52.724 --> 34:54.670
"We're gonna get arrested,
this is where she lives. "

34:54.826 --> 34:56.396
He looked at the mail,
he goes, I said,

34:56.561 --> 34:57.938
"Yeah, I used to know,
I know used to deliver mail...

34:58.096 --> 34:59.598
I was the paper boy,
like, I was... "

34:59.764 --> 35:01.937
And I go, and he goes,
"You're out of your mind. "

35:02.100 --> 35:04.307
And of course the
whole house woke up

35:04.469 --> 35:06.642
and we managed to
evade the police.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.251
- I remember one time being in
the dressing room with Crimmins.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.182
He used to talk like, you know,

35:11.343 --> 35:12.754
"We're gonna make
a difference here. "

35:12.911 --> 35:15.414
And I'm like, "Uh... does
anyone have any coke'?

35:15.580 --> 35:16.581
Is there coke around?"

35:16.748 --> 35:18.489
- The most insane thing that
happened at the Ding Ho

35:18.650 --> 35:20.823
is everybody became
a cocaine addict.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.933
- So Barry, as you know,
hates cocaine.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.194
- And we all kept it
from him, you know'?

35:26.358 --> 35:28.167
- You doing drugs?
What kind are you on?

35:28.326 --> 35:29.703
- Uh, cocaine.
You want some'?

35:29.861 --> 35:31.033
Uh, no thanks.

35:31.196 --> 35:32.937
- "No, I'm not doing coke.
No, no, no. " You know?

35:33.098 --> 35:35.009
So, you know, "I gotta go
to the bathroom again. "

35:35.166 --> 35:36.144
You know'?
And you go in.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.542
Yeah,...
Do I look all right?

35:38.703 --> 35:40.512
And he knew it.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.447
- I get in the cab one day
to go to the Ding Ho,

35:42.607 --> 35:44.985
where I worked for several
years to make the place happen.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.680
And someone says, "You going
over there to get some blow?"

35:47.846 --> 35:50.486
"Jeez, no, I'm going over
for the prostitutes. "

35:50.649 --> 35:53.027
- Interestingly enough,
he wasn't the alpha.

35:53.184 --> 35:56.222
The alpha was Lenny
and the beta was Barry.

35:56.388 --> 35:59.665
- And he was, you know, he was
cerebral and did his politics,

35:59.824 --> 36:04.239
and I was the exact opposite
end of the spectrum.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.340
'Cause I love women.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.999
Women are probably the
number one reason

36:07.165 --> 36:10.044
why I'm not
a homosexual today.

36:10.201 --> 36:13.546
Okay, I blew one guy but
I needed a ride real bad.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.979
Ah, you're great.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.054
I'm kidding you,
I'm teasing you, folks.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.919
I didn't need the ride.
See, the thing is...

36:23.081 --> 36:26.153
- He would overlook my,
my, my right wing,

36:26.317 --> 36:28.263
my right wing nut job stuff...

36:28.420 --> 36:30.058
because I pulled people
into the club.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.564
And he was not a stupid man.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.498
He saw me bringing people in,
and so he says,

36:33.658 --> 36:35.604
"We'll put up with your bullshit
because you bring people in.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.671
But you're wrong!
You're wrong!"

36:37.829 --> 36:40.036
There was the night I
walked in with a chainsaw

36:40.198 --> 36:42.872
and I fuckin' sawed one
of the tables in half

36:43.034 --> 36:45.071
and the fuckin' place- I said,
"Any hecklers here tonight?"

36:46.738 --> 36:48.012
<i>And sawed the table m half.</i>

36:48.173 --> 36:50.380
And the fucking
crowd went crazy,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.113
and Crimmins was steaming,
just steaming.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.053
Couldn't wait to fucking get me.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.591
And he says, "Are you
out of your fucking mind'?

36:57.749 --> 37:00.252
What if that fucking chain broke

37:00.418 --> 37:02.921
and went up and sliced someone's
fucking face in half?"

37:03.088 --> 37:04.931
I go, "Wow, man, that
would have been cool. "

37:05.090 --> 37:07.127
But you know,
in retrospect, he's right.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.771
What if I hit a,
what if I hit, like,

37:08.927 --> 37:10.463
a screw or something,
and the chain, like,

37:10.628 --> 37:11.538
you know?

37:11.696 --> 37:14.108
People,
they don't want to maimed.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.267
They want to laugh 'till they
puke or piss their pants

37:16.434 --> 37:18.414
but they don't want to
be maimed, you know'?

37:18.570 --> 37:20.049
I voted for Ronald Reagan.

37:20.205 --> 37:22.913
To this day I think he
was a great hero to me.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.078
And I'm sure he was the
Antichrist to Crimmins,

37:26.244 --> 37:28.417
and he said so on stage.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.722
But I'm testimony to the
fact that his compassion,

37:32.884 --> 37:37.960
his humanity, isn't restricted
to people that agree with him.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.968
- You know, we were very
close and very different.

37:42.127 --> 37:46.269
He's more about anger and I'm
son of more about depression.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.934
He's also one of the few
people I know who gets

37:49.100 --> 37:52.912
more articulate the angrier
and more upset he gets.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.312
- Forgive me, and if I seem
like I'm threatening stuff

37:55.473 --> 37:57.419
or going after stuff,
I'm negative or whatever...

37:57.575 --> 37:59.111
no, but there's just a lot
of bullshit out there

37:59.277 --> 38:00.415
and I have all week
to notice it

38:00.578 --> 38:02.922
and you guys don't so
I just try to report to you,

38:03.081 --> 38:05.687
and I mean well, and if I
seem negative or whatever,

38:05.850 --> 38:07.989
please, it just means
I'm still in there pitching

38:08.153 --> 38:10.133
and everybody else has
given up so who's positive

38:10.288 --> 38:12.768
and who's negative in
that deal? I don't know.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.603
- You may recall, in 2005,
there was a woman,

38:16.761 --> 38:21.506
Cindy Sheehan, who had
lost her son in the war.

38:21.666 --> 38:27.173
And she wanted to
see George W. Bush.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.715
And she went down to Texas

38:28.873 --> 38:30.875
and she was waiting
outside the ranch.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.851
- I don't want any
more children to die.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.513
I'm a broken-hearted morn.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.352
Why would I want
one more mother

38:36.514 --> 38:37.788
to go through what
I'm going through

38:37.949 --> 38:39.485
just because Casey is dead?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.790
- It started off a little slow
with seven people

38:41.953 --> 38:43.660
and then Barry came down.

38:43.822 --> 38:44.823
He was there for weeks.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.368
I mean, he... I mean, hundreds
and hundreds of media came

38:48.526 --> 38:50.199
as a result of his efforts.

38:50.361 --> 38:53.171
- I think he could also
see what was happening'

38:53.331 --> 38:56.244
how the media and other
forces were coming

38:56.401 --> 39:00.349
to kind of spread
their own message.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.145
He is deeply offended

39:03.308 --> 39:04.981
that the world doesn't
think these things

39:05.143 --> 39:08.317
are as important as
the world says they are.

39:08.479 --> 39:12.859
He would like the world
to be a principled place.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.998
He would like politics to
be an honorable profession.

39:16.154 --> 39:19.328
He would like the world
(o share his values.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.937
And one of the ways it's
expressed when he's on stage

39:23.094 --> 39:26.098
is in the tremendous
kindness that he shows

39:26.264 --> 39:28.870
to the audiences
he's screaming at.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.774
You know'?

39:30.935 --> 39:33.609
- Barry Francis Crimmins
is fucking ashamed

39:33.771 --> 39:35.682
of the United States
of America right now.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.582
You should all be... if
you've got no fucking courage,

39:38.743 --> 39:40.416
if you don't stand up
against this bullshit,

39:40.578 --> 39:43.252
and you don't believe,
go read some Tom Payne

39:43.414 --> 39:45.087
and then see what you
should do right now.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.459
You decide what you do right
now because I'm embarrassed.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.293
I'm embarrassed
to live in a country

39:50.455 --> 39:52.765
where everyone's
cowed into bullshit.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.926
"Oh, well, well, but
you know in the end

39:55.093 --> 39:56.231
we're still the greatest land- âŞ

39:56.394 --> 39:57.566
We suck right now.

39:57.729 --> 40:01.233
The United States of America
in 2004 sucks right now

40:01.399 --> 40:02.605
and is an embarrassment.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.371
So lets see if that
makes the cut.

40:04.535 --> 40:05.238
I hope it does.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.647
If it does,
you're watching a good movie.

40:07.805 --> 40:09.876
- He stopped, I think,
worrying about whether

40:10.041 --> 40:10.951
he was being funny or not.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.385
And the audience,
rightfully was like,

40:13.544 --> 40:14.989
"Who the fuck is that guy'?

40:15.146 --> 40:16.454
Why is he yelling at us

40:16.614 --> 40:20.255
because I don't know about
where chalk comes from? "

40:20.418 --> 40:23.331
- What I couldn't do is,
I always had to close shows

40:23.488 --> 40:25.297
and would watch the
acts on before me,

40:25.456 --> 40:26.958
and I would watch the audience
think they were great

40:27.125 --> 40:29.162
and I'd hate the audience
by the time I got out there

40:29.327 --> 40:32.433
because it was, you
know... you know,

40:32.597 --> 40:34.804
"Where you from'? What do you do?
You're a queer. "

40:34.966 --> 40:37.105
You know those comics.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.679
Why do women go
to the bathroom in pairs?

40:38.836 --> 40:40.509
Because they get
hassled by drunk men.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.652
Write an act, you asshole!

40:46.010 --> 40:48.513
How come foreigners drive
cabs and work at the 7-11'?

40:48.680 --> 40:51.593
Because they're entry
level jobs, that's why.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.127
Same reason your great
grandparents built the rail road.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.425
Write a goddamn act!

40:57.588 --> 40:59.090
I used to be proud
to consider myself

40:59.257 --> 41:00.668
a stand up comic but I can't.

41:00.825 --> 41:02.964
I don't want the
guilt by association.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.334
- He doesn't do it on purpose
but he can make you feel

41:05.496 --> 41:07.942
a little small or guilty
about having had a...

41:08.099 --> 41:11.637
really a basically
incorrect political idea

41:11.803 --> 41:13.305
or notion about something.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.280
- I didn't mean to
insult you or anything...

41:15.440 --> 41:18.353
well, I guess I meant to,
like, inform you

41:18.509 --> 41:20.648
but it came out as an insult.

41:22.547 --> 41:25.653
I'm awful goddamn
sorry for that.

41:25.817 --> 41:31.631
- He doesn't even really
like the word "comedy".

41:31.789 --> 41:35.134
And, you know, having
covered comedy for so long'

41:35.293 --> 41:38.831
I can understand how he's
sort of at odds with it.

41:38.997 --> 41:42.809
I sometimes feel cheap,

41:42.967 --> 41:45.345
that I'm up just up on the
stage making people laugh.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.540
It's kind of like
testing your reflexes.

41:47.705 --> 41:50.982
It's just a nervous reaction.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.418
And I think he has
always felt that way'

41:53.578 --> 41:56.081
I suspect, as a comedian,

41:56.247 --> 41:59.820
that he wasn't going up there
just to make people laugh.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.828
- Fucking I hate comedy,
I really do.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.525
Almost everyone involved
with it, ya know?

42:06.691 --> 42:09.831
I'm super-needy
but blah, blah.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.871
What did you think?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.840
- And it was extremely
stressful just watching him

42:14.999 --> 42:17.240
because first people
would be mad that

42:17.402 --> 42:18.938
they're not really laughing.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.673
Some people would leave.

42:20.838 --> 42:23.375
And then there would
be... some people would heckle.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.884
Barry doesn't...

42:25.043 --> 42:27.455
he doesn't suffer
fools wisely.

42:27.612 --> 42:30.525
He lays into those hecklers.

42:30.681 --> 42:34.185
It is completely unbelievable.
It's just beautiful.

42:34.352 --> 42:36.093
Whoever it is doesn't know'

42:36.254 --> 42:38.700
does-n'! know what he's doing,
really.

42:38.856 --> 42:40.961
He thinks he's just going
to yell at the guy on stage.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.798
He doesn't know the force,
the energy,

42:42.960 --> 42:46.237
that he's going to be
crushed verbally for two'

42:46.397 --> 42:48.035
three minutes maybe.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.110
Just overwhelmed.

42:50.268 --> 42:54.910
- Someone would say something
and he would just go off.

42:55.073 --> 42:56.746
What?

42:56.908 --> 42:58.649
Did I vote for Carter?

42:58.810 --> 43:01.757
In this most recent election?

43:01.913 --> 43:05.224
Yeah, I was a die-hard.

43:05.383 --> 43:06.487
Jimmy Carter?!

43:06.651 --> 43:08.824
What, if I don't like Reagan,
I have to like...

43:08.986 --> 43:10.966
therefore it falls
I like Carter. Fuck you.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.760
You're like a college student,
aren't you?

43:12.924 --> 43:14.426
College students
these days are real hip.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.162
"I support the president.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.670
I've got a computer
in my dorm.

43:17.829 --> 43:19.001
I've never gotten laid.
I got drunk once;

43:19.163 --> 43:20.574
I'm pretty sure
the beer was bad. "

43:20.731 --> 43:22.972
Fuck you.
Fuck your family.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.511
No, he kept going and going.

43:24.669 --> 43:27.582
And then he would fuckin'
beat them down so much.

43:27.738 --> 43:28.910
Want some more?

43:29.073 --> 43:33.180
Fucking gold boy?
Fuck you. Fuck you.

43:33.344 --> 43:35.483
Jesus, not tonight,
not tonight.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.523
- And he would do
a litany of shit.

43:37.682 --> 43:38.752
More facts and'

43:38.916 --> 43:40.657
"Did you know this?
And did you know that?"

43:40.818 --> 43:43.321
And the people would go,
"What the fuck, man?

43:43.488 --> 43:44.523
It's a comedy show. "

43:44.689 --> 43:45.463
Jimmy Carter?!

43:45.623 --> 43:47.102
What, do you think
I like Jimmy Carter'?

43:47.258 --> 43:49.135
Jimmy Carter and his immediate
family has never been seen in

43:49.293 --> 43:53.002
public without mucus on
some part of their body.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.802
Carter's best plan
to get the hostages out

43:54.966 --> 43:56.673
is go out into the desert
and attack ourselves

43:56.834 --> 43:58.871
with helicopters.

43:59.036 --> 44:00.538
You know what he promises?

44:00.705 --> 44:02.378
"A government as good
as its people. "

44:02.540 --> 44:05.043
Apparently we suck.

44:05.209 --> 44:07.314
"If you don't like Reagan,
you like Carter. ll follows. "

44:07.478 --> 44:08.650
Fuck you.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.292
"Fuck you.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.359
Fuck you,
Mister Politic Boy.

44:12.517 --> 44:15.361
That shit doesn't
affect me. "

44:15.520 --> 44:16.658
He goes,
"It doesn't affect you?!"

44:16.821 --> 44:17.799
- My impression of
Richard Nixon:

44:17.955 --> 44:20.993
"Where is that constitution?"

44:21.159 --> 44:24.197
How come nobody ever shot
that motherfucker?

44:24.362 --> 44:26.808
Shoot him.
Piss on his grave.

44:26.964 --> 44:29.740
He would go into a rage.

44:29.901 --> 44:32.472
And I said,
"Barry, what the fuck?"

44:32.637 --> 44:35.174
- There was something shaky
and weird about him

44:35.339 --> 44:36.647
but I couldn't put
my finger on it.

44:36.807 --> 44:38.684
- I don't know if a lot of
people knew why at that point.

44:38.843 --> 44:39.685
I don't 'think I did.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.881
- I certainly wasn't the
only one who noticed it'

44:42.046 --> 44:44.890
but there was just...
you knew that wasn't him.

44:45.049 --> 44:47.427
And then when all that
stuff happened with him,

44:47.585 --> 44:49.861
you kind of understood,
you know,

44:50.021 --> 44:53.901
that self-protective shell that
he put over himself for so long.

44:54.058 --> 44:57.528
- I remember writing about it
and talking to him and saying'

44:57.695 --> 45:00.369
"You gotta cutout
the clubs for a while.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.703
The clubs just
aren't working for you.

45:01.866 --> 45:02.901
I don'! know what you're
going to do next

45:03.067 --> 45:06.412
but the clubs obviously aren't
the right place for you. "

45:06.571 --> 45:09.017
As I look back now
in retrospect,

45:09.173 --> 45:11.210
a lot of this makes sense.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.199
- Okay.
Mm-hmm. I love you.

45:24.355 --> 45:25.891
- Okay.
Bye, mom.

45:29.026 --> 45:31.131
He's had some rough times

45:31.295 --> 45:32.706
but he's like I am,
you know?

45:32.863 --> 45:35.241
I've had them, too, but I
forget about the rough ones

45:35.399 --> 45:39.370
and try and be happy
that I'm alive and doing well.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.911
- I knew my mother liked
Black-Eyed Susans

45:43.074 --> 45:45.782
and I would pull clumps
of them out of the ground.

45:45.943 --> 45:47.980
I didn't know that you were
supposed to cut them off,

45:48.145 --> 45:50.421
so I would bring them
to her like clumps

45:50.581 --> 45:56.554
with the roots still dangling,
all full of dirt.

45:56.721 --> 46:00.294
And because she liked it
so much I kept doing it,

46:00.458 --> 46:02.734
and I didn't realize she was
getting kind of a kick out of me

46:02.893 --> 46:05.271
being an idiot.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.500
Now I feel bad about
wiping out generations

46:07.665 --> 46:09.167
of Black-Eyed Susans.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.939
But, you, know, that's me,
I find a way to ruin anything.

46:12.103 --> 46:15.107
He was really a great boy.

46:16.274 --> 46:19.619
- So this was dated back
in early May of 1992.

46:19.777 --> 46:23.190
"Barry Crimmins has been the
social and liberal conscience

46:23.347 --> 46:26.021
of the Boston comedy
almost since its beginning.

46:26.183 --> 46:28.629
His topical and political
humor has always been

46:28.786 --> 46:31.960
intensely personal
and acidic.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.660
Crimmins took both of those
traits to a new level last night

46:34.825 --> 46:36.771
in perhaps the most
highly-charged

46:36.927 --> 46:39.271
and soul-baring
monologue ever staged

46:39.430 --> 46:41.603
in one of the city's
comedy clubs. "

46:41.766 --> 46:43.336
That was amazing.

46:43.501 --> 46:44.980
He got up at Stitches.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.377
- It was just like a regular
stand up comedy show.

46:47.538 --> 46:49.211
And the crowd was good

46:49.373 --> 46:51.478
and he was popular in Boston
and everybody loved him,

46:51.642 --> 46:53.144
you know,
so they were all psyched.

46:53.311 --> 46:54.722
- There was nothing
funny about it,

46:54.879 --> 46:56.859
as one might imagine.

46:57.014 --> 46:58.186
"Near the end of the night'

46:58.349 --> 47:00.158
after a rambling,
scathing indictment

47:00.318 --> 47:02.525
of almost every aspect
of American government

47:02.687 --> 47:05.190
and culture'

47:05.356 --> 47:09.998
a clearly tortured Crimmins
suddenly shifted topics. "

47:10.161 --> 47:14.871
- Anytime somebody that
you've known for a long time

47:15.032 --> 47:20.575
discloses something huge
and game-changing and...

47:22.740 --> 47:27.519
it makes you rethink
that whole person.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.180
- "Since I was a little kid,
he began,

47:29.347 --> 47:32.385
I could never stand to see
anyone innocent victimized.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.757
I've always identified with
victims and thought that was

47:34.919 --> 47:37.092
because I was some
white kid from a rich town

47:37.254 --> 47:39.495
in upper state New York.

47:39.657 --> 47:42.069
Only recently, Crimmins went on,
did he really begin

47:42.226 --> 47:44.502
to understand that
wasn't the reason.

47:44.662 --> 47:48.371
The room instantly grew as
silent as a newly dug tomb. "

47:59.176 --> 48:01.213
- So I'm a little kid...
I'm a real little kid...

48:01.379 --> 48:04.849
and I'm by all reports
a sweet little kid.

48:05.015 --> 48:06.358
Curly haired...

48:06.517 --> 48:08.963
I mean, I remember
everybody loving me.

48:09.120 --> 48:14.229
I remember, you know,
strangers doting on me'

48:14.392 --> 48:16.895
and I remember
trusting everyone'

48:17.061 --> 48:22.876
and I remember delighting in,
figuring out what's going on.

48:24.034 --> 48:27.607
What, you know,
day and night is,

48:27.772 --> 48:30.218
and what, you know,
the sun is.

48:30.374 --> 48:32.285
I was a good little kid,
you know?

48:32.443 --> 48:33.615
And I deserved a break.

48:33.778 --> 48:36.816
I was a sweetheart like
every little kid. You know?

48:36.981 --> 48:38.255
I deserved a break.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.989
And I didn't know
what was headed my way.

48:42.153 --> 48:44.064
You know,
my parents who weren't...

48:44.221 --> 48:48.294
they just went out sometimes
so they had a babysitter.

48:48.459 --> 48:52.930
And, uh...

48:53.097 --> 48:56.601
the babysitter
kind of set me up

48:56.767 --> 49:00.078
and made me like her a lot.

49:00.237 --> 49:02.080
And then this guy
started coming over

49:02.239 --> 49:06.085
who was her mother's
boyfriend or something.

49:06.243 --> 49:08.280
You know, something that was
an arrangement that wouldn't

49:08.446 --> 49:11.655
have been formally
discussed in the late 50s.

49:11.816 --> 49:14.922
Sometimes you know
who's not good.

49:15.085 --> 49:17.964
And anyway this guy
was not good.

49:18.122 --> 49:19.999
And,you know,
I can remember him, like,

49:20.157 --> 49:21.795
touching my curly hair.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.701
There was always, like,
an attraction, you know'?

49:24.862 --> 49:27.365
Like, I generally
didn't mind but this guy...

49:27.531 --> 49:30.034
there was something just wrong.

49:30.201 --> 49:32.477
You know, I couldn't tell
you now how many times.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.047
I mean, I could never...

49:34.205 --> 49:37.550
how many times or whatever
but it was a number of times.

49:37.708 --> 49:39.346
This guy would come over,

49:39.510 --> 49:44.789
he would take me down in the
basement and... rape me.

49:50.788 --> 49:53.291
- Barry felt that it was key
to interview you.

49:53.457 --> 49:56.301
He actually said to me
that you're his hero.

49:56.460 --> 50:00.670
And that's in regards to...

50:00.831 --> 50:03.835
ms rape.

50:04.001 --> 50:07.813
- It's scary for anybody
of any age to really see

50:07.972 --> 50:10.885
someone who's gone,
who's the face of evil,

50:11.041 --> 50:13.715
who's like this nothing.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.516
There's no soul there.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.660
There's nothing.
It's just so...

50:18.816 --> 50:21.194
possessed by what they have,

50:21.352 --> 50:24.856
what they feel like
they have to do,

50:25.022 --> 50:27.559
what they can't not do.

50:27.725 --> 50:32.940
And I would of course
scream and cry...

50:36.100 --> 50:41.100
and... my face would get shoved
into these couch cushions...

50:47.444 --> 50:49.685
to muffle the noise.

50:49.847 --> 50:52.953
Well, this sewed to
suffocate me and I...

50:53.117 --> 50:58.396
I would get asphyxiated
and pass out.

50:59.189 --> 51:01.066
This is...

51:04.128 --> 51:07.041
a lot to ask of me.

51:07.197 --> 51:11.111
Anyway, so...
let's see...

51:11.268 --> 51:13.475
So I was, like, five.

51:13.637 --> 51:16.481
So I.. - even like a normal
five year old,

51:16.640 --> 51:19.917
I sneaked in the house, right?

51:20.077 --> 51:22.648
And nobody was upstairs.

51:22.813 --> 51:25.089
So I thought that was
very strange, like,

51:25.249 --> 51:26.387
you know, where's Barry?

51:26.550 --> 51:28.052
Where's the babysitter?

51:28.218 --> 51:29.891
So...

51:30.054 --> 51:32.227
I went downstairs,

51:32.389 --> 51:36.098
walked down the stairs and...

51:36.260 --> 51:40.299
you know, I thought
Barry was dead.

51:40.464 --> 51:43.308
Then the babysitter saw me
and yelled my name

51:43.467 --> 51:45.743
and then Barry
looked up at me...

51:52.242 --> 51:57.356
And I ran and just...
knew he needed help.

52:01.518 --> 52:07.434
So I made it up
almost to the top stair

52:07.591 --> 52:09.696
and she got my foot'

52:09.860 --> 52:15.368
and I was screaming,
and I bit the babysitter.

52:16.533 --> 52:18.206
Pretty hard.

52:18.369 --> 52:23.686
- I read of this poor
little girl in India

52:26.844 --> 52:27.879
who was raped to death.

52:28.045 --> 52:31.549
I think she was 3 years old.

52:31.715 --> 52:34.628
Imagine that. I mean,
I've been through some stuff'

52:34.785 --> 52:36.890
but being raped to death...

52:37.054 --> 52:41.662
Well, I mean, that's the
end of your whole life.

52:41.825 --> 52:44.328
And I just felt
so badly for her,

52:44.495 --> 52:46.805
felt so terrible for her.

52:46.964 --> 52:51.003
And I was,
you know, relating to it,

52:51.168 --> 52:54.911
and I was just thinking, yeah,
so, it could've been worse.

52:55.072 --> 52:58.986
I had almost been raped
to death a number of times.

53:00.244 --> 53:02.224
- But it's that glance
that gets you,

53:02.379 --> 53:03.687
you know what I mean?

53:03.847 --> 53:08.091
Life registers in, in... kind of
visually on people, you know?

53:08.252 --> 53:11.324
It's a glance that lasts
a lifetime, you know?

53:11.488 --> 53:14.059
Just like the glance from
my brother, you know?

53:14.224 --> 53:16.830
And I had to, like, belt out of
there and run up some stairs

53:16.994 --> 53:18.098
and what the hell'

53:18.262 --> 53:21.175
and yet the whole world
was changed for both of us

53:21.331 --> 53:23.333
from that point on,
you know?

53:38.182 --> 53:43.632
- It was the most shocking thing
I think in my life that I heard,

53:43.787 --> 53:46.028
when I heard the whole story.

53:46.190 --> 53:48.796
I mean, it makes you
just revile humanity.

53:48.959 --> 53:54.409
It makes you want to hug Barry
and just... or fucking kill him,

53:54.565 --> 53:56.567
you know,
put him out of his misery.

53:57.634 --> 54:03.084
<i>And it just took a long time for
me as his friend to get over it.</i>

54:03.240 --> 54:06.221
- To me it gave me
a little bit of resolve

54:06.376 --> 54:09.323
knowing the man that I do.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.824
'Cause there was, there
was always anger there.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.120
There was always something.

54:13.283 --> 54:16.059
- He's always seemed a little angry.
- There was always...

54:16.220 --> 54:20.134
- he was always pissed off at something, and...
- And he'd show it on stage too.

54:20.290 --> 54:22.270
- And it started to
kind of fit into place.

54:22.426 --> 54:27.899
- I do remember the
headline in The Phoenix:

54:28.065 --> 54:29.339
"Baby Rape. "

54:29.500 --> 54:32.344
And it was,
you know, something

54:32.503 --> 54:34.608
that I don't think
I understood,

54:34.772 --> 54:36.809
fully comprehended at first.

54:36.974 --> 54:42.185
It was like something
that I myself would go'

54:42.346 --> 54:44.348
you know, "Why, why would you,
why are you talking about that?"

54:44.515 --> 54:46.085
You know?
"That was a long time ago.

54:46.250 --> 54:49.356
Why bring that up?"
You know?

54:49.520 --> 54:53.297
And it wasn't until that I came
to terms with my own sexuality

54:53.457 --> 54:55.130
and my own abuse

54:55.292 --> 54:59.331
that I looked back
on that and said,

54:59.496 --> 55:01.373
"Look at how courageous,
you know,

55:01.532 --> 55:04.706
he was to admit that
and not be afraid. "

55:04.868 --> 55:07.007
A lot of gay people
here tonight?

55:13.644 --> 55:16.386
Just me. OK.

55:16.547 --> 55:19.460
You know, Lenny
had called Crimmins

55:19.616 --> 55:22.654
and told him that I was gay.

55:22.820 --> 55:26.199
And then he called me
and it wasn't...

55:26.356 --> 55:28.063
he didn't even ask me,
you know,

55:28.225 --> 55:29.829
if I was or wasn't gay.

55:29.993 --> 55:33.338
It was just, like,
this kindness that he had that,

55:33.497 --> 55:35.807
it would be okay if I was.

55:35.966 --> 55:38.378
And I just continued to
deny it, you know?

55:38.535 --> 55:39.570
"No, I'm not, I'm not. "

55:39.736 --> 55:42.216
Because that was my whole life,
you know?

55:42.372 --> 55:44.579
That, you know,
you were just, like'

55:44.741 --> 55:47.688
constantly hiding
that you are who you are'

55:47.845 --> 55:50.985
you know,
so I couldn't admit it.

55:51.148 --> 55:54.357
It took me a long time to,
you know, come to that,

55:54.518 --> 55:55.588
come to those terms'

55:55.752 --> 55:58.494
and when I did, you know,
I called Barry and it wasn't...

55:58.655 --> 56:00.896
he didn't say, "I knew it,"
or anything like that.

56:01.058 --> 56:03.868
It was just this kindness
that he had,

56:04.027 --> 56:06.268
and if it was anything that,
you know,

56:06.430 --> 56:08.535
if there was anything
that he could do to help me,

56:08.699 --> 56:09.769
you know,
he would be there.

56:09.933 --> 56:11.105
But you can be
a football player.

56:11.268 --> 56:13.544
You can be a fucking homo
and be a football player.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.513
How about that?

56:15.672 --> 56:16.776
You couldn't do that
years ago.

56:16.940 --> 56:20.444
Now you can be
a football player.

56:20.611 --> 56:23.057
And everybody's going,
"Oh my God, he's so brave.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.056
He's so brave!

56:25.215 --> 56:27.286
He plays football,
and he's gay.

56:27.451 --> 56:29.453
He's brave.
That's brave. "

56:29.620 --> 56:30.928
I'll tell you what's brave.

56:31.088 --> 56:35.230
I told my wife I was gay.
That's brave, alright?

56:35.392 --> 56:37.201
That is brave.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.799
- So many people
said this to me:

56:42.966 --> 56:44.968
"Well, are you talking
to anyone about it?"

56:45.135 --> 56:47.308
Yeah, I thought I was
fuckin' talking to you.

56:47.471 --> 56:48.211
You know?

56:48.372 --> 56:50.750
But what they're really saying
is go talk to the psychiatrist

56:50.908 --> 56:52.979
who's then gonna...
and I did, and you know'

56:53.143 --> 56:56.147
they said, "Well, there's
a variety of things... "

56:56.313 --> 56:57.815
and basically they
were just telling me

56:57.981 --> 56:58.925
what drugs
they could put me on

56:59.082 --> 57:01.790
and for once in my life
I turned down drugs.

57:01.952 --> 57:04.592
- I was sitting in the offices
of Moving Forward,

57:04.755 --> 57:08.464
the news journal that
I published and edited,

57:08.625 --> 57:11.071
and answering phones,

57:11.228 --> 57:14.937
and I get this call
and it's Barry Crimmins.

57:15.098 --> 57:17.078
So he told me a
little bit about himself,

57:17.234 --> 57:19.077
but it was very humble,
you know?

57:19.236 --> 57:22.012
He didn't get into,
you know,

57:22.172 --> 57:23.981
all this stuff about
being a famous person

57:24.141 --> 57:25.779
or, you know,
anything like that.

57:25.943 --> 57:29.948
He really just wanted
someone to talk to.

57:30.113 --> 57:34.960
He had been rejected repeatedly
by numerous organizations

57:35.118 --> 57:38.827
who were out there
supposedly helping victims

57:38.989 --> 57:41.663
of childhood sexual
abuse and...

57:41.825 --> 57:44.135
you have male survivors
and you have female survivors

57:44.294 --> 57:46.331
and generally the
two mix quite well,

57:46.496 --> 57:47.702
at least in my experience.

57:47.864 --> 57:50.640
But there are, you know,
both men and women

57:50.801 --> 57:54.977
who don't want anything to do
with the opposite gender,

57:55.138 --> 57:56.947
you know, the gender
that they were abused by'

57:57.107 --> 57:59.815
and unfortunately Barry
encountered a couple

57:59.977 --> 58:01.388
of these people in Cleveland.

58:01.545 --> 58:03.320
When Barry went to Cleveland

58:03.480 --> 58:05.824
he kind of stopped
doing comedy

58:05.983 --> 58:10.295
and was looking for
other survivors,

58:10.454 --> 58:12.559
people like him who had
been raped as a child.

58:12.723 --> 58:15.704
And this was when AOL
was in its infancy.

58:15.859 --> 58:18.396
And they had all
these chat rooms.

58:18.562 --> 58:20.166
- You know, Barry called me
up one night and he said,

58:20.330 --> 58:21.707
"Lana," he said'

58:21.865 --> 58:25.074
"Go here and then go here. "

58:25.235 --> 58:26.873
You know, "Look at this. "

58:27.037 --> 58:28.983
And I, I just went...

58:29.139 --> 58:32.484
Wow, I couldn't believe,
you know, what I was seeing.

58:32.642 --> 58:34.918
- What he ended up finding
was people exchanging

58:35.078 --> 58:36.853
child pornography.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.357
- You know, it's the
first time these people

58:38.515 --> 58:40.426
ever had a community.

58:40.584 --> 58:42.086
You know, I mean,
you really could never talk

58:42.252 --> 58:44.562
to other child
molesters or whatever.

58:44.721 --> 58:47.827
And they're emboldened
and living it up,

58:47.991 --> 58:51.029
and when I first
stagger in there,

58:51.194 --> 58:52.935
I do what any
normal person would do,

58:53.096 --> 58:55.201
I just go,
"Are you people crazy?"

58:55.365 --> 58:58.209
- Somebody would in
good faith send you a file

58:58.368 --> 59:00.609
and expect something in return.

59:00.771 --> 59:03.775
- They very often would start
sending me child pornography

59:03.940 --> 59:05.942
to show me how much
fun I could have.

59:06.109 --> 59:08.612
- He had gone to AOL
repeatedly and said,

59:08.779 --> 59:12.420
"Look what you're hosting,
this horrible stuff. "

59:12.582 --> 59:14.562
And they would just, you know,
patronize him and say,

59:14.718 --> 59:16.891
"Thank you for your help
with this" and do nothing

59:17.054 --> 59:18.863
'cause they were making
a ton of money off of it.

59:19.022 --> 59:20.558
- You know, we're used
to broadband, okay?

59:20.724 --> 59:22.135
I mean, you know, this...

59:22.292 --> 59:25.603
when we were on dial-up modems,
this was not a flat rate,

59:25.762 --> 59:29.938
and if you spent a certain
level of time online,

59:30.100 --> 59:31.204
you got charged more.

59:31.368 --> 59:34.144
- And one of the main things
that these child molesters

59:34.304 --> 59:36.147
talked about in these
rooms was, you know'

59:36.306 --> 59:39.651
they're spending a thousand,
$1,200 a month to be on AOL.

59:39.810 --> 59:42.654
- So Barry poses
as two children

59:42.813 --> 59:45.453
and stockpiled all
this information

59:45.615 --> 59:47.822
that was evidence...
crime evidence.

59:47.984 --> 59:49.554
That's what child
pornography is.

59:49.719 --> 59:52.495
- I make an account,
and I make it two kids,

59:52.656 --> 59:55.102
and they say
"Our parents make us share...

59:55.258 --> 59:58.330
our stupid parents
make us share an account. "

59:58.495 --> 01:00:01.567
- I just can't imagine kind of
locking yourself away

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:05.645
and pretending to be,
you know,

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.282
one of these people that
caused him such misery

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.315
in order to set them up.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:12.420
- If you've seen
child pornography...

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:14.613
when you've seen
a picture of a little kid

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:19.124
with curly red hair
getting raped by a big guy

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.354
who looks exactly like him
with curly red hair,

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.363
and the look on the
kid's face and his eyes'

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:28.935
you can see, like,
the humanity leaving the kid...

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:34.474
The loss, the...
he's just shutting down

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:38.670
as much as he can
while still being alive.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:42.715
- I know that
seeing what he saw

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:45.683
was something that he
couldn't get out of his head.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:49.483
- You know, he damaged himself
to, like, save these kids.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.627
And, you know, you talk about
things that you can't unsee,

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.228
and he saw so much
horrible stuff.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:58.025
- I think that one of the
things that's so extraordinary

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:02.034
about this is how
physically sick Barry was.

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:05.139
- He told me he got down to
something like 155 pounds,

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.504
which, you know, was probably
a good 100 pounds lower

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.235
than he had been.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.371
- He had a haunted,
hollow look.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:18.816
I've never seen anyone transform
to a shadow of a person

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.182
like I saw him transform.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:26.761
- As with most people
who have been abused,

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.194
different things are gonna come
back to you at different times.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.196
Somethings going
to trigger a memory.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.699
A difficult, painful memory.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.395
And I know that this did.

01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:39.871
I know that this did that-.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.678
<i>- This guy contacts
me and he says,</i>

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:51.182
"I want you to take a pair
of your underwear

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.116
and pee on them,

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.756
and... do you know what a Ziploc
bag is?" I said, "Yeah. "

01:01:55.912 --> 01:02:00.383
"Put them in a Ziploc bag
and mail them to me. "

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.688
And I said'

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:05.856
"Sure, give me your address. "

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.262
I became aware of Barry

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:10.405
because my immediate
boss instructed me

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.937
and another fellow prosecutor

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:14.473
to go out to his house
and to speak to him.

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.577
He had something to (ell us.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.940
We drove to Lakewood.
It wasn't too far away.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:20.775
It was in an apartment complex.

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.645
I remember we had to pound
on his door a number of times

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:25.047
to get his attention.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:26.653
He finally came to the door'

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:30.087
and we were met by a man
who was fairly striking.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.920
He had dark hair.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.323
Unkempt, for sure.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:37.055
- You know, here's Barry
with a Che poster up.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.099
A lifelong LSD enthusiast.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.497
I'm sure they...

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:43.103
I don't know what
they thought of Barry.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.501
- He had been looking
on the computer

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:50.111
and researching the sharing
that was taking place.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:53.009
People were talking to
each other on computers

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:57.481
and at the time our office
didn't even have computers.

01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:59.848
We couldn't understand
what he was talking about.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:03.287
How were people communicating
with each other on computers?

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.983
- Yeah, you can even talk with
people all over the world

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:07.184
on chat lines.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.126
- Don't they have chess games
and stuff like that, too'?

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.665
- Yup. They got more stuff
than you can imagine.

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.096
- It was clear that
he had knowledge

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.463
about what he was doing,

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:19.971
but when we saw him,
it didn't make sense.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:25.978
He was a man that I could
describe as crazed at the time.

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.177
He said that they were
sending images of children

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.648
who were being raped

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:36.689
and images of children who
were having sex with adults.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:39.122
It's something that we
had never heard of before.

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:41.387
We were shocked.
We were astonished.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.691
I mean, I left there
fairly shaken

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:49.826
and not knowing how our office

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.473
was going to deal with
that into the future.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:59.905
He essentially left us
with a big problem.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.437
- I was thinking Frank Capra
but feeling Don Knotts

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.836
as I began my testimony
before the U.S. Senate

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.738
Judiciary committee.

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:31.537
My hand trembled so rapidly

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.682
that there were small craft
warnings for my water glass.

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:39.412
- There's no excuse in
presenting pornography

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:42.216
where children
can get ahold to it.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:46.020
- Senator Strum Thurmond,
Pterodactyl, South Carolina,

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.219
Thurmond's genius may
be that nobody ever

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:50.092
knows what the hell he's saying.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:52.233
The indecency.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.029
The lawlessness of pornography

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:58.070
being presented where
children can reach it

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.208
should not be allowed
under the law.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.365
- I unsuccessfully stifled
a huge grin

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.910
as he blathered some
senatorial cordiality

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.048
that he was appreciative that'

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:09.240
"This
here hearing was important

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:10.976
'cause it concerned children. "

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.485
- Our children are the
future of this country.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.816
- Senators Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin,

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:18.823
Mike DeWine of Ohio
and Paul Simon of Illinois

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:21.963
all boasted of their
unfamiliarity with the internet.

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:24.064
This being 1995.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.461
It seemed as if they took
a certain manly pride

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:28.603
in how low tech they were.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:32.137
- Most of the Senators who voted
wouldn't have the foggiest idea

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:34.002
how to get on the
internet in the first place.

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:35.973
- My children,
if they were here'

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:38.339
would tell you that
I'm computer illiterate,

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:41.277
so you're gonna have to kind of
take" walk me through this.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.111
- I have to say there is
no one in this room

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.583
with the possible exception
of Senator DeWine now

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:47.949
who is less competent
in this area

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.647
of computers than I am.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:52.589
- Each bravely disregarded
his cyber illiteracy

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:55.593
and went on to espouse
numerous platitudes

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:58.323
and make impassioned,
ambiguous statements.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:00.832
- You know, I'm not a lawyer,
and I'm not going to say

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.336
that I know exactly where things
fall within the Constitution.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.634
- After hundreds of hours
of documenting

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.141
things to sickening to relate,

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.304
my moment had arrived.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.450
A man stepped up beside me.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.380
After months of knocking
on AOL's door,

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.146
I was suddenly face to face
with Bill Burrington.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.550
My name is Bill Burrington.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.157
- America Online's
Assistant General Counsel

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.988
and Director of
Government Affairs.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.721
Burrington was nattily attired
and youthfully handsome

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:33.629
with male model, slicked back,
wind tunnel resistant hair.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.566
His shoes were worth
more than my education.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:38.137
So there I sat'

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:40.831
my heart pounding
but in the right place.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.068
Sitting in the sterile,
formal environment

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.076
of the U.S. Senate
hearing chamber,

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:47.215
I was haunted by
the horrifying images

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.646
I had seen over the
past seven months.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:53.344
The children with the dead eyes
and (he defiled bodies.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.922
I wished everyone
could see the pictures.

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:58.320
I wished no one
could see the pictures.

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.928
And I thought about the kids
who could still be protected.

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:04.057
My name is Barry Crimmins.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.427
I'm a writer and a children's
rights and safety advocate

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.500
residing in Lakewood, Ohio.

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:12.037
I'm also an adult survivor
of childhood sexual abuse.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:15.335
I go into this hearing with my
suit and my Jerry Garcia tie on

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.535
and I look like a, you know,
a marijuana grower

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.236
at his arraignment.

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:21.439
Much of the controversy
surrounding the problems

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:24.380
of online pedophile centers
on parental controls.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.385
- Parental control protects
the vast majority of families

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.047
where parents want to control
what their children do.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.693
In many cases, the parents
themselves are the perpetrators

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:33.793
of these crimes.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.794
This issue completely
disregards the serious reality.

01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:39.695
AOL constantly has rooms
entitled "Family Fun,"

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:42.132
"Nudist Families,"
"Incest is Best,"

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:44.533
"Have Hot Step Daughter,"
and so on.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.867
In these rooms,
child pornography is traded

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.135
and incest is discussed
and celebrated.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.472
Many of the photos that are
exchanged are purportedly

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:52.977
of people's own children.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.241
- Mr. Crimmins rejects parental
control on the basis

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:58.249
that some parents transmit
images of their own children.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.751
But we think this
misses the point.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.253
- I'm all for
parental control software.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.552
<i>I was, I was mischaracterized
as being against it.</i>

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:07.058
I just pointed out a flaw in it'

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.059
that some parents
abuse their children.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:12.461
- He was angry, and they're
not used to hearing anger.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.568
And of course he was angry.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.671
Look at what he'd
just been through.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.966
They weren't quite sure
what to make of Barry.

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:22.904
I hope this will result in the
arrest of numerous traffickers

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:24.408
<i>m child pornography.</i>

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.343
I also hope that it establishes
that AOL has had a great deal

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:30.643
of prior knowledge as to how
its service is being misused

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:34.310
and therefore AOL
facilitates and profiteers

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:36.081
on these dastardly crimes.

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:38.087
- I think that there were
some statements made that are,

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.488
are accurate and some
that are a bit misleading

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:43.290
and we appreciate Mr. Crimmins
involvement in this issue.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.296
We want to make sure we
have an accurate record.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.935
We want to work with
Congress to protect children;

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:51.435
empower parents to screen
out unwanted material;

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:54.370
and preserve constitutional
guarantees of free speech,

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:57.136
free press and
individual privacy.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.608
- These people are
deluding themselves

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.112
if they think child pornography
is protected speech.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.807
It is not.
It is crime evidence.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:04.974
During his testimony,

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.519
he made several patronizing
references to me,

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.317
and he attempted to
dismiss as dated

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.823
many of the problems
I described.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.724
- Much of the activity that
Mr. Crimmins has been involved

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.796
on America Online
occurred early this year,

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.228
in January/February.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.732
Last Monday afternoon'

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.702
I was sent numerous files
of child pornography.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:27.671
I attempted to forward it
to AOL's post office boxes,

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.401
the toss adviser,
toss email, they...

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.238
<i>n said that n was unavailable</i>

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.712
because it was full
in both cases.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:37.818
I don't know how much it
would cost them to open up

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:40.386
another mail box
for themselves.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:43.990
And I haven't heard back
about those files,

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:46.024
for example,
and I very rarely do.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.184
- Now, in your case,
you did receive responses.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.228
I've reviewed the correspondence
and you received responses...

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:51.591
- I've received
responses at times,

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.995
but I haven't received
responses at other times.

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:56.865
And the more heinous it is,
the less response I get.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.165
It's like there's denial
involved or something.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.671
Well, there's no denial here.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.208
We're trying the best we
can to manage our growth.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.710
- Mr. Burrington, let me
make sure I understand

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.711
what your testimony is.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.851
You mention that it's
your company's policy

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:14.079
that if we've got a room
full of pedophiles

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:17.554
and you see that going on,
that you try to zap that out.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:18.454
Is that correct?

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.719
- We truly have pretty much
"three strikes, you're out"

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.920
at America Online, as a
lot of the services do,

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:24.360
which is you are
given a warning...

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.761
- I don't think child... people
trafficking child pornography

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:28.095
should get three strikes.

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.964
I think they
should get one strike.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:32.629
I don't think that they
deserve three strikes.

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.138
I think that's a heinous crime,

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:36.402
and I think one strike
and you should be out

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:36.965
for child pornography.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.445
- OK, let's take it,
if I could...

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.911
- And all of a sudden
I see Chuck Grassley

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.778
lean over to his aide and go.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.749
"Who is this guy?"

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.910
And, you know,
the guy goes,

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.147
"He's one of ours. "

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:51.553
Grassley's like'
"Oh, OK, OK."

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:52.590
I had 'em.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.592
And Burrington
from that point on

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:57.459
had lost his very
expensive footing.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.928
I've explained this to AOL,

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.590
I've sent them extensive
questions...

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.634
I've almost did an
interrogatory...

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:04.430
for the past several months.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.575
Their response has been
arrogant and dismissive.

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:10.074
Barn/ continued,
and the buzzer's going off.

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:11.439
How close are you to, uh...

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.080
- I'm getting there.
I'm very close.

01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:14.476
- OK, I hope so.
- OK.

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:17.083
- Barry's just blowing
right through 'em.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.811
- It's not hyperbolic to state
that AOL is the key link

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.923
in a network of child
pornography traffickers

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.753
that has grown exponentially
over the last several months.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:28.418
What has recently taken place
is nothing short

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.621
of the de facto
decriminalization

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.095
of child pornography.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:33.996
This is a full scale emergency'

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:35.659
and I'm here to tell the
American people today

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:38.465
that not only are their
children in danger

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.538
when they're on AOL'

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.800
they're in danger
because of America Online.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.500
Thank you.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:49.606
- I remember not really
getting the depth

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.843
of what Barry had been through

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:57.151
until I saw a list of the names
of the chat rooms.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.226
And when I sat with
that list on my desk'

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:03.125
after I printed it out,

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:06.165
I just put my head down
on my desk and sobbed.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.495
And...

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:17.067
it wasn't only because
of my own abuse,

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:20.180
you know, because
I saw, you know,

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.407
"Daddy Does Daughter,"
and, you know,

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:27.648
just this vile, you know,
representation of violence

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:31.655
against children.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:35.591
But it was because
I saw just in words

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:37.662
what Barry had been through.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.366
- If you can judge a person
by the enemies they make,

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:52.877
you know, my enemies are, like,
NAMBLA and politicians.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.379
Now, I can live with that.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.854
- I think the important thing
about Barry is his connection

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.928
with trying to make the
world a better place.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:11.292
That's the thing that never,
never changes, you know'?

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:12.694
He's not become
cynical about it.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:15.426
He's not allowed it to sort of

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.195
poison the way he feels
about people.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.397
I always hit it off with Barry
right from the beginning

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:20.905
because although he
was political,

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.543
he wasn't sort of ideological.

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:27.078
- The most memorable show that
I saw Barry Crimmins do

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.809
was he was performing
with Billy Bragg

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:34.147
and it was a big tour
that Billy was doing

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:35.482
with the Red Star Army'

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.091
and Barry Crimmins was
really opening the show.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.726
He was the emcee
for the show.

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.953
- So we invite him on
and he would, you know,

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:45.156
do the equivalent
of a guitar solo.

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:46.959
He would do a
couple of punchlines.

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:49.433
We'd break,
he'd lay in there.

01:13:53.296 --> 01:13:55.298
1,2,3,4.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:59.112
- You know, Billy,
a lot of people ask me...

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:02.446
You say you're from
the United States,

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:03.845
But if I hate that
country so much,

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:04.746
why don't I get out of it?

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:06.443
I say, "Because I don't
wanna be victimized

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.680
by its foreign policy. "

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:13.855
- It was almost
like a Socialist

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:17.259
sort of version of Laugh In
where Barry would tell a joke

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.458
and then Billy would
go back into a song.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:28.539
I guess he was...

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.473
I guess he would've been
the Goldie Hawn of it.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:31.771
It's just funny where'

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.311
you know, I'm working
in bars every night,

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.608
and we're just going, and
we're telling our dick jokes

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.717
and going home or
whatever, you know'?

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:41.320
So Barry wins this Peace Award
from this Peace Abbey.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.855
So I go to be at the
ceremony or whatever

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:49.053
and it's... the two recipients...
it's Barry and Maya Angelou.

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.219
You know?

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:52.662
So they had the ceremony'

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:56.497
and Gandhi's grandson is there

01:14:56.659 --> 01:15:00.163
to present the award
to Maya and Crimmins.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:04.038
And... he's overweight.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.680
Like, he's pretty overweight.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.406
And I'm just,
we're at the ceremony,

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:10.744
and Crimmins just
whispers to me like,

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.580
"That's Gandhi's grandson.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.745
He could lose a few. "

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:17.183
Let me ask you this:

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.883
Irish... religious upbringing?

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:21.995
- I'm a Catholic
but it's in remission.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.425
It's in remission?

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:25.930
Based on fear
and real estate.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.831
- Did your religious upbringing
influence your politics,

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:31.266
do you think?

01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:33.429
- Yes, those people
mistreated me so much

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:37.271
that they made me start to
believe in that kind of stuff.

01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:41.939
I tweet the Pope every day
demanding excommunications.

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:44.277
You know,
we gotta have our hobbies.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.258
I haven't been to mass
in 43 years.

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:55.225
Our trial separation is over.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.523
Please excommunicate me.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:02.197
Chase away the Monday blahs
by doing something new

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:04.702
like excommunicating me.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.369
I know what you've done.

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:09.032
I know what you represent.
Are you fucking kidding me'?

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.144
I go, send me...
I'll know I'm in hell...

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.043
if there's Popes and
Bishops there, shitbag.

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:21.821
Later on... this is now
40 years later...

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:25.117
and my friend John Considine
calls me one day and says,

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:27.887
"Go online, check out the
Syracuse Post-Standard

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:31.054
and there's a story
about Neary in there.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.632
And this guy Charlie Bailey
has gone public

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:35.325
and talked about how

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:38.472
he had been tremendously
sexually abused. "

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:43.299
- Barry's helped me by
telling me, you know,

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:45.412
that, reinforces, that you'

01:16:45.568 --> 01:16:46.945
you're told that
you're the only one

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.174
and you feel like
you're the only one.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.818
And then Ban? saying,
you know,

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:56.946
he had I'll n-ins
with Neary, and...

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:01.289
you know,
you feel a little bit good

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.953
that you found somebody
else that's been in your shoes,

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.828
but then you feel awful
that they exist, too.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:09.094
These guys are masters
at what they do.

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:10.430
I mean, they're...

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:12.698
I would swear to God they
take a class somewhere

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:15.342
because what he did is he
told my mother, he says,

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:18.001
you know, I would be upset
after my counseling sessions

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.840
because it's really
hard to be a priest

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:22.482
and there's a lot of pain
and sacrifice involved

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.015
in becoming a priest,

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:27.643
so if afterwards I was upset
or I was crying,

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:31.815
I was withdrawn,
just ignore it.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:35.554
Say a prayer over 'em
and ignore 'em.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:38.562
And this is all about 6 weeks
worth of grooming

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:41.167
before he finally raped me.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:52.977
- This piece of shit
operated for years,

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:55.877
and was from church to church
all over upstate New York,

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.814
harmed hundreds of children.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.511
Countless little boys.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:05.352
I know of probably 25, 26.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:10.556
- I had been raped by a priest,
when I was 12, 13 years old

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.998
and this guy's name
was Thomas Neary.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.195
I was in a deep,
dark depression,

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.432
and I really didn't know
what to do or where to go.

01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:23.941
Sometimes I would type this
priest's name in the internet

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:27.546
to see if there was
anybody out there.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:32.015
So I typed in his name and
up came Barry Crimmins' name.

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:33.710
- If I ever saw anybody
do that to a kid,

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.618
I would be over that
fucking railing so fast'

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:39.350
smashing his head with a
tabernacle or whatever

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:42.086
the lucky magic shiny
shit they should sell

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.424
and feed the poor with.

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.867
I saw people keep their mouths
shut and not break silence

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:52.403
and not take action when
a child was being harmed

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.631
right in front of their eyes.

01:18:53.796 --> 01:18:54.900
How much did that...

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.738
how much did everyone?
silence embolden Neary?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:01.211
He tested the waters with
what he did to me in public

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.747
on that altar every morning.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:03.781
He did Mo me.

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.782
If he could get away
with that shit in public,

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.080
what do you think he could
get away with in private,

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.417
And what he could get
away with was raping kids

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:13.583
and making them swallow
his filthy, fucking semen

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:17.561
and telling them it's Eucharist,
that's it's the body of Christ.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.495
Fuck him.
Burn.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:22.397
I hope there's a hell you
fucking piece of shit, Neary.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:26.062
I hope there's a fucking hell,
and I hope there's an eternity,

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.174
and I hope they triple
the time of it,

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:30.606
you fucking piece of shit.

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:44.483
Fucking Pope.

01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:47.457
Fuck you, Pope!
Fuck you, Pope!

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:51.530
And they find Francis of Assisi
after a thousand years?

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:53.291
Oh.
I'm so mad.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:56.026
I mean, like,
I fucking hate the Ca-

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:59.365
I mean, really,
God bless everybody.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.633
Nah, I don't mean to say that.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.344
But I don't mean not to.

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:07.947
'Cause I don't like,
you know I...

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:11.346
atheists are just
so evangelical.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.214
It's like you become.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.480
You know,
you become what you resist.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.057
You're evangelists.
You know, like, I don't care.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.990
Telling me that we all
gotta believe the fucking shit'

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.324
or I don't gotta believe
the fucking shit,

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.056
or whatever the fuck it is.

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.223
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.734
I got tortured enough
as a child dealing with

01:20:30.893 --> 01:20:32.566
the fucking Catholic church.

01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:35.299
And I don'( want to sign off
on your fucking shit

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:38.502
or talk about it anymore!

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:48.178
I just wrote that.

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:54.388
"Many people are so overwhelmed
by the thought of child abuse

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.860
that they'll do just about
anything to change the subject

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.430
when it's mentioned.

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:01.591
The most common device these
subject switchers utilize

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:03.031
is the ultimate decree.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.832
They'll say, 'I think if someone
gets caught abusing a kid,

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:07.530
they should be
rounded up and killed.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:08.902
Case closed. '

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:10.907
I wouldn't have
wanted my rapist

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:14.013
put out of his own misery
and into mine.

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:16.080
I started life without
blood on my hands,

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:17.717
and I aim
to keep it that way.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.853
Had the man who had raped me
on numerous occasions

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:22.113
not died in prison while
serving his third term

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:24.450
for sexually abusing
very young boys,

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.559
I might have gone to see him.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.059
My personal revenge
would've been to show him

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.562
that I did not become
what I resisted.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.633
And I hadn't grown into a
cruel and heartless man.

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:37.794
I would've told him that he
inflicted a burden upon me

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.439
that almost killed me.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:42.303
And not just when I was
nearly asphyxiated

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.466
during his savage assaults.

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:47.045
Then I would tell him that
I was sorry that he had such

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:48.875
a miserable and wasted life.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.573
Even if I supported
the death penalty,

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.776
I wouldn't want child rapists
killed simply because

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.716
they were once
children themselves.

01:21:54.877 --> 01:21:57.084
In all likelihood,
they were abused children.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:59.817
While most victims of
childhood sexual assaults

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.791
don't grow to
become pedophiles,

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.657
the vast majority of pedophiles

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:06.060
were sexually abused
as children.

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:08.599
Who knows what would've
happened to me

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:12.136
if I had been raped a few more
times or a few years later. "

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.501
Now, if it had been
five more times,

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:17.769
would I have gone over,
would I be the rapist today?

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.412
Would I be the m...
you know,

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:20.842
would I be the horrible
person today?

01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:21.636
I don't know.

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.241
So spiritually, I mean'

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:26.443
I feel like I have this
huge debt to pay.

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:30.681
I feel like there's entire
nations that feel like I do.

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:32.519
You know?
There's entire nations.

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:35.787
And you know what, and that's
why I don't give a shit about

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.589
American dreams
or whatever 'cause,

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:39.630
I mean, you know what,
I, that's who I am.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:40.789
That's the country I am.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.369
I'm of the country of
the raped little kids.

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:47.439
I'm of the country of
the fucking heartbroken.

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.041
And the screwed over.

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:52.202
And the desperate with
no chance to be heard.

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.870
That's what country I'm from.

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:57.711
- People tended to believe
that abuse in males

01:22:57.873 --> 01:22:59.875
was exceptionally rare.

01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:03.114
Well, I think we know now
that's not the case.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:08.489
And a lot of that is in large
part to what Barry's done.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:13.622
I mean, Barry has been
very out there as a survivor.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:17.971
- I've had some problems
from when I was younger

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.470
from people you
trusted very we'll

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:21.972
and they did some
bad things to you

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:26.135
and he helped me get rid
of that to a point

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.975
where I can focus on
more of my family

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.515
than rather than have that
be in my mind all the time.

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.084
That's one of the things
he knows about my life

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:34.846
that there ain't a lot
of people that know.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.014
And, uh...
he did that for me,

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.059
and I'm very thankful
for him for that.

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:44.322
- Any chance Barry got,
he was defending me

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:46.693
or he was telling
the true story

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.766
'cause of course there
were a lot of lies

01:23:48.924 --> 01:23:50.494
and stuff out there about me'

01:23:50.659 --> 01:23:53.230
but he was there to say.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.068
"You know, I actually
know Cindy Sheehan,

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.506
and this is the Cindy
Sheehan that I know. "

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:01.739
- It started, like,
on Memorial Day.

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:06.046
And I was just home,
and I was, and he said,

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.347
"No Vet should be alone
on Memorial Day.

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:10.547
You should have a... you
should have some cook-out. "

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.124
So he bought me one of them
big barbecue chickens

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:18.527
and some other stuff
and it was...

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:20.860
and then, and then he left,
you know,

01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:23.765
he was like, you know,
a ghost sometimes.

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:27.135
He would do stuff
when I was asleep.

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:29.867
Sometimes I'd wake up
and, you know,

01:24:30.032 --> 01:24:32.740
the dishwasher is empty or
there's something, you know'?

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.539
Ifs like,
how'd this happen?

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:38.116
To me, prayer is behavior.

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:39.809
You don't stand on
a mountain and say'

01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:41.784
"I believe in God
and you don't.

01:24:41.944 --> 01:24:44.584
Therefore I'm saved
and you're damned. "

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.226
Prayer is gestures.

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.658
It's trying to do
the right thing,

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:52.594
always trying to weigh the
right and wrong in everything

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.893
before you make a decision.

01:24:55.057 --> 01:24:56.968
And Barry always does that.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.763
- I think those of us
who survived

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.304
have all learned coping skills.

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:02.669
I'm not sure when
I first met Barry,

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.812
which probably was in the 80s.

01:25:05.968 --> 01:25:08.574
Ä°f he had all the coping skills
stitched together.

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:12.412
He used to talk about
being followed by the wolf.

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.652
The things he had
yet to work out.

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:22.762
The rape.
You know'?

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:28.095
The rage at some of the
political things that happened.

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:30.702
- It's almost like there's
a need in him to get back

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:33.305
what was taken from him then.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:34.634
You know?

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:38.767
But the reality of that is
there is no getting that back.

01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:40.205
- I gotta tell you.
You know what?

01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:41.439
I don't give a fuck anymore.

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:43.776
I don't give a fuck.
Let me tell you this shit.

01:25:43.939 --> 01:25:45.816
Monday...

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:51.014
Monday, we went
to the basement...

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:54.956
we filmed in the basement where
I got raped as a little kid.

01:25:55.117 --> 01:25:57.358
And so since then,

01:25:57.519 --> 01:26:00.500
I don't know,
I've been a little spacey.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:03.136
You're gonna laugh.
It's OK.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:04.634
But I went.

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:07.000
You know, I went there.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.507
I don't really go back there
and hang around that often.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.686
You know, I've done my
quote unquote "work",

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.755
although there's always
more to do sometimes.

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:28.520
And what I believe about
that work for abuse survivors,

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.358
you have to go through things
and not around them.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.662
But "through" is a goal,
you know?

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:37.565
You get "through" it.

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:41.902
I was given some sort of a gift,
or I have some sort of a gift

01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:43.873
or was born with it,

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.444
where I can convey
things to people

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:50.242
they don't generally
want to hear about.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:54.285
If there were some grand
rhyme or reason to things,

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:57.014
I could understand why
I was gonna grow up

01:26:57.179 --> 01:27:00.717
to be a big strong man who
knew how to tell people stuff

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.953
they didn't want to hear
and make 'em like it.

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:05.064
You know, not like
what was happening

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.861
but make it accessible
to people.

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:12.365
What I came to learn and
out myself a break about

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:13.938
and many other people

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.303
is when you meet people
and they behave oddly

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:17.944
or they have these
weird quirks

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.205
or whatever it is
they're doing,

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:22.746
if you figure out
where they come from,

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.248
what happened to them,
whatever their deal is,

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.216
you realize there's
sanity at the source

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:30.481
and instead of this
behavior being like insanity,

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.591
it's in fact ingenious.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:36.218
It's a survival technique.

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:40.423
So, you know, I had my
survival techniques.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:50.441
There's no way...
coming someplace where

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:54.274
what happened to me as
a child, coming back to it,

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:57.440
does make
your breath a little shorter

01:27:57.606 --> 01:28:01.520
and you feel it
a bit in your...

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.850
in the pit
of your stomach.

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:09.986
<i>Thais W?
Hob; "My.</i>

01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:12.826
It's a different place.
Good.

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:22.498
So it's just sort of on,
you know, sort of on this site.

01:28:22.931 --> 01:28:28.108
You know... and I
don't think we need to...

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:33.015
I don't think there's any need
to build shrines to demons.

01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:38.818
Um, I...

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:44.623
I hope that there's been a
lot more good spirits here

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:48.666
than that one awful one...

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:52.738
and that generations of kids
have grown up and visited

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:55.465
and played in that house

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:57.405
without anything
happening to them

01:28:57.566 --> 01:28:59.546
except things that
should happen to kids.

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:02.079
They got a chance.
They learned about life.

01:29:02.237 --> 01:29:05.150
They had fun.
They laughed.

01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:07.548
And that's the only trepidation
I would have about this

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:11.521
is I wouldn't want any kid
that lives here, you know...

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.092
Although, we have to
compromise a little bit

01:29:14.249 --> 01:29:16.354
of children's innocence
to keep them safe.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:21.024
To tell them they
must be protected...

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.856
YOU know?

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:24.861
There's no shrine
to that maniac

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:30.908
who did those heinous crimes
to me and my sister.

01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:32.841
Maybe because
even witnessing it'

01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:38.781
you know, is severe violation
of a young spirit or anybody.

01:30:36.665 --> 01:30:39.077
Yeah.

01:30:39.234 --> 01:30:41.680
Nothing special.

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.907
Just a basement.

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:49.349
You know,
if that kid can survive that,

01:30:49.511 --> 01:30:51.115
if I can survive
what happened to me,

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.316
you can at least hear
about it or think about it,

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:54.619
YOU know?

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:55.989
H's not that much too ask.

01:30:56.151 --> 01:30:59.291
I know it's unpleasant, and
I know that people give us,

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.660
"Oh, everybody is a victim. "

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:03.302
Well, I'm not a fucking victim.
You know?

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:06.871
I'm not a victim.
I was but I'm not anymore.

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:09.099
And, uh...

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:12.006
But I am a witness.

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:15.171
You know?
And...

01:31:15.337 --> 01:31:17.874
I'm my life's testimony.

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:21.316
You know, not only to
what happens to kids,

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:27.188
but what you can go on
to do and become,

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:29.886
no matter what they do.

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:32.531
Unless they kill you.
You know?

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:35.634
But that was close in my case.

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:39.397
It was real close.
But I'm here, I made it.

01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:42.064
Thus, call me lucky.

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.903
OK?

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:50.572
And I'm not coming
back here again.

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:30.923
- He might say that
he hasn't changed

01:32:31.079 --> 01:32:36.620
but when I first knew Barry
he was just a raw nerve.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:41.063
He still has that fire in him,

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:47.104
but it's a little less
at the whole world

01:32:47.262 --> 01:32:48.741
and at specific targets.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.207
- You know who the biggest
suck-heads in the world are?

01:32:51.366 --> 01:32:52.640
The people who think
they're clever,

01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:55.475
that are like, "Well, I happen
to be politically incorrect. "

01:32:55.637 --> 01:32:58.550
And now you get to act like
you're a cutting edge rebel

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:01.880
because you're reinforcing
the oppressive status quo.

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:07.152
You sack of fucking
rancid horse assholes!

01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:11.824
- I remember from
my youth thinking, like,

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:14.830
you know, this guy needs
to be taken down a notch.

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.400
Do you know what I mean?

01:33:16.558 --> 01:33:17.935
It's like,
who does he think he is'?

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:20.835
And now ifs sod of like'
well, someone should,

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:23.339
he should be taken
up a notch, I think.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.978
- He gives a voice to all
those moments that you have

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:31.913
that, where you can't seem to
articulate your anger at this,

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:34.246
this entity, this, this...

01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:38.323
at the injustice in the world
and how powerless we are.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.290
But he's a reminder
that you do have power.

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:45.761
- I think underneath the
cynicism and the rage

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.665
is a sense of idealism
and justice.

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:54.602
The child who first discovered

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:57.208
that everything they
told him about society

01:33:57.365 --> 01:34:01.142
was supposed to
operate was untrue.

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:06.980
And that begins a life
journey to reconcile that.

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:09.179
- I'm tired of being
called a radical.

01:34:09.344 --> 01:34:11.654
I don't think I'm radical.
I don't think you're radical.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:12.985
I don't think we're radical.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:14.684
What's so radical
about what we want?

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:15.793
We want peace.

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.486
We want economic justice.

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:18.824
We want civil rights.

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:20.625
We want jobs.
We want hope.

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.495
We want public transportation.

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:23.658
I'm a radical?

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:24.895
No, I'm not a radical.

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:27.903
I don'! have 400,000 troops
assembled in a desert

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.632
wearing scuba diving suits

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:32.403
to bring me more oil and
I'm already choking to death on.

01:34:32.567 --> 01:34:33.978
That's radical.

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.077
- People go, "Why do you
have to say that you're gay'?

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.843
Why do you have to do that?"

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.249
Well, why don't I'?

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.048
Why shouldn't I be
able to get up there

01:34:44.212 --> 01:34:45.384
and tell people who I am'?

01:34:45.547 --> 01:34:46.719
And why shouldn't
Barry get up there

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:48.918
and tell people
where he's come from

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.393
and his plight and his
journey that he's been on'?

01:34:51.553 --> 01:34:53.533
And that's what,
that's what comedy,

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.393
that's where n comes from.

01:34:54.556 --> 01:34:56.695
Ä°t comes from,
comes from jour...

01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:59.532
it comes from a lot of places'
but it comes from pain, too.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:01.401
- My mother goes to me,
please go to the priest.

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:03.270
Tell the priest that you're gay.

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:06.037
Please do that for me
before I die.

01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:08.044
Please, go to confession.

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:11.582
So I went to confession, and I
told the priest that I was gay,

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:14.345
and it was very difficult
to tell him that.

01:35:14.509 --> 01:35:20.460
Uh, now we're dating, but so
it worked out... really well

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:24.126
- Well, I'd never
call Barry a saint.

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:26.196
And Barry...

01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:28.766
you know, he always
grumbles about God'

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:32.427
but I know I think half the
reason why Barry's so funny

01:35:32.594 --> 01:35:35.734
is a gesture of healing'

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.810
and it sounds kind of corny
to put it like that.

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:40.412
You know what I mean?

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:44.983
But I think, really, it's from
something deep inside him.

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:47.881
- He's like music.
He's harmony.

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.214
He's nature.

01:35:49.377 --> 01:35:51.948
He has an understanding
what beautiful is,

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:56.220
and he has an understanding
of what horrific is.

01:35:56.384 --> 01:36:01.129
- You know, I'd like to sort of
in many ways be more like Barry.

01:36:01.289 --> 01:36:02.734
He's been wonderful to me

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.995
with all this problems
that I've had.

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.604
He's always been there.

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.298
And he still calls me
every day and always said'

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:11.444
"You can call me in the middle
of the night if you need me. "

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.671
You know? So that's a
wonderful way to feel.

01:36:14.836 --> 01:36:17.783
- He's like a dancing
bear that got loose

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:19.816
and now he's calling the tune.

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:21.419
He's got the deep voice.

01:36:21.576 --> 01:36:23.749
He's shaggy-

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:26.619
And we always thought that
deep voice and shaggy meant'

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.351
you know, a creature.

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:30.427
And he's a beat up creature.

01:36:30.585 --> 01:36:32.155
But guess what?

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.267
That brain is completely,
you know,

01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:38.802
on the ball and
the heart is enormous.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.964
When I think of him,
I just think of us smiling.

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:44.610
Like, it makes me smile like...

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:46.439
don't you think he's one
of the smartest people

01:36:46.601 --> 01:36:49.480
- you ever met in your life'?
- Yeah, definitely.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.878
- I can't think of anybody
that I really respect

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.644
more than Barry.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.810
Certainly a better person
for having known him.

01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:57.456
- Something that I've always
remembered about him

01:36:57.612 --> 01:37:03.187
is we cannot surrender
being the rude, funny,

01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:05.194
obnoxious truth tellers.

01:37:05.353 --> 01:37:07.993
We cannot surrender that.
That's our best weapon.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:10.659
It's funny how you become

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:13.635
really best friends with people,
you know?

01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:16.207
So I just,
I guess I love him.

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:19.641
I think I'd be remiss
in not saying.

01:37:19.801 --> 01:37:23.715
- There's no way we should've
been the friends we were.

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:26.044
But we were really
great friends

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:30.417
because he was really
instrumental in, um...

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:31.818
he made me a lot of money.

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:35.722
I think of Barry as a relative

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:39.353
because what he thinks
of me is really important.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.366
But at the same time, he
loves me unconditionally.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.094
So it's very weird.

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:47.034
He's like a boat.

01:37:47.195 --> 01:37:51.541
A nice, real nice sailboat
or something like that.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:55.442
If you have a chance
to get on that boat,

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:56.946
get on it.

01:37:57.105 --> 01:38:01.110
- Sometimes the most
anti-religious people

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:04.620
behave the most religiously.

01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:08.283
- We have to have enough
guts to open up our ears,

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:10.895
to open up our hearts,
and to listen,

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:14.932
look, watch and
believe and testify'

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:19.936
to what really happens to
innocence in this world.

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:24.270
We have to take care of
innocence in this world.

01:38:24.432 --> 01:38:26.639
And we have to be
brave enough

01:38:26.801 --> 01:38:28.439
to stand up and tell the truth

01:38:28.603 --> 01:38:31.743
about what happens to
innocence in this world.

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:33.442
So tell the truth.

01:38:33.608 --> 01:38:36.384
Tell everyone the truth.

01:38:36.544 --> 01:38:39.548
Tell anyone the truth

01:38:39.714 --> 01:38:42.285
because your lives
depend on it.

01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:44.123
My life depends on it.

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:50.099
And people who really can't
be heard really depend on it.

01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:52.636
They really depend on it.

01:38:52.794 --> 01:38:54.330
Thank you very much.

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:04.674
So I'm Barry Crimmins,

01:39:04.839 --> 01:39:06.944
trying to be a good guy

01:39:07.108 --> 01:39:11.284
but putting off a nasty aura
most of the time

01:39:11.446 --> 01:39:15.258
so that people don't go...
to me all day long.

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:16.656
You know, there's so many
people who've been through

01:39:16.818 --> 01:39:17.956
what I have been through

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:19.530
and they are afraid
to deal with anybody.

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:24.193
For whatever reasons
I was only hurt so much

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:27.828
and then somehow
I had a lifetime

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.997
where I was lucky enough,

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.508
like, my drug of choice
was friends.

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:40.478
<i># Yeah, I know I got Religion</i>

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:42.279
<i># It took me away</i>

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:44.621
<i># It took me away</i>

01:39:44.779 --> 01:39:49.159
<i># Yeah, we're locating my...</i>

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:51.456
- It's interesting to see
that the same things

01:39:51.619 --> 01:39:54.691
that he was thinking
about back in the 90s

01:39:54.856 --> 01:39:57.496
are essentially the platform
that's being used

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.901
not only in our county
but throughout the nation.

01:40:01.062 --> 01:40:03.042
We have indicted over
a thousand people

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:05.677
for sharing child pornography.

01:40:40.101 --> 01:40:41.239
Hey, Goldthwaite.

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:42.938
You suck.

01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:46.343
- There's these...
there's nobody else like him.

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:47.417
He's just one of a kind.

01:40:47.575 --> 01:40:49.384
- And I don't want to
fawn over him 'cause he's,

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:50.716
you know, kind of a dick.

01:40:53.014 --> 01:40:54.288
He's terribly racist.

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:56.291
I don't know if you knew
that about Barry Crimmins.

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.521
It's something that we
would fight about a lot.

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:03.630
- This is such an odd circum...
because even his closest friends

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.202
don't know this side of Barry'

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:10.900
but we were both America's
biggest hope in figure skating.

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:13.443
And we met m Montreal'

01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:15.581
we were training for
the Olympics...

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:18.945
it's kind of a cute image.

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.551
Crimmins calls me up,

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.881
and I get over to his house
and he's not there.

01:41:23.044 --> 01:41:25.320
And then I hear this
clatter downstairs,

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.584
and he's down there'

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:30.957
he's got 20 can opener
bottle openers

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:34.497
and he's just throwing 4 here,

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.134
goes in another room,
and throws 4.

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:37.166
I say, "What the heH
are you doing?"

01:41:37.325 --> 01:41:40.670
He said, "I couldn't find a
fuckin' beer opener

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:41.966
so I bought 20 of them

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:43.472
and I'm scattering them
around (he house. "

01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:47.408
So he'd never be shy
a bottle opener again.

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:49.605
- I remember picking him up
and I, you know,

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:52.080
I always had like,
kitschy stuff in my car

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.912
like a frog on the dashboard

01:41:54.075 --> 01:41:56.021
or you know some sort
of stuffed thing,

01:41:56.177 --> 01:41:57.781
and he'd go,
"You're a grown man.

01:41:57.945 --> 01:42:00.289
Why do you got
toys in your car for?"

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:01.586
And he'd toss 'em.

01:42:01.749 --> 01:42:03.751
He'd just, held chuck
'em right out the car.

01:42:03.918 --> 01:42:05.192
And I never felt like
I could go,

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:07.697
"Hey, don't do that. "
I'd go, "Alright. "

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:10.768
You know,
toss my stuff, I guess.

01:42:10.925 --> 01:42:13.303
- He would pull into the front
of my house on a Sunday morning

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:15.441
and really low toot the horn.

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:18.668
Not like a beep beep beep,
but just a.

01:42:18.833 --> 01:42:20.312
And I would wake up going,

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:21.845
"What is that?
What's that noise?"

01:42:22.003 --> 01:42:23.311
That's Barry Crimmins out front

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:26.611
'cause they don't sell liquor
in Boston on Sunday.

01:42:26.774 --> 01:42:28.845
So he wants me to drive
him to New Hampshire.

01:42:29.010 --> 01:42:30.011
And he would pull to
the front of my house'

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:32.179
and I'd be like, "But Barry,
my, my wife and my baby,

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:33.450
I really, I can't... "

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:34.888
He'd be like,
"This is taking up time. "

01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:36.722
- Because, you know...
I mean, I have this problem

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:37.862
about being in show business.

01:42:38.019 --> 01:42:39.555
I can feel shame
and embarrassment,

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.495
and it's, like,
really, like,

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:44.068
ruins you if you're
in show business.

01:42:44.225 --> 01:42:45.397
I'm such a bad actor,

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:48.665
I can't even be in a
documentary about myself.

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:52.542
- Crimmins audition,
James Franco.

01:42:53.067 --> 01:42:54.876
- This...
this mark?

01:42:55.036 --> 01:42:55.912
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:58.175
- And... you set?
- Yeah.

01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:00.683
Ready, and action.

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:03.481
- People say, "Barry, if you
don't love this country,

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.385
why don't you leave it?"

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:08.823
Because I don't want to be a
victim of its foreign policies.

01:43:08.983 --> 01:43:10.326
Ugh.

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.725
Socialism is bad.

01:43:12.887 --> 01:43:15.265
Yeah, I learned that
in public school.

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:19.030
Public school is socialism.

01:43:19.193 --> 01:43:20.570
Ugh.

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:51.826
I do not fear excommunication.

01:44:51.986 --> 01:44:53.522
I demand it.

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.462
Fuck you, Crimmins!
