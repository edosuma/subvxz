WEBVTT

00:03.730 --> 00:05.527
Money.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.128
CARY:
How much money?

00:07.170 --> 00:10.037
Twice what I'm making here.
And all

00:10.070 --> 00:13.369
for the price of your soul.
Not my whole soul, just
little pieces of it.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.777
Anyway, I heard defense
attorneys have better sex.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.607
If you like
coming from behind.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.039
(laughing):
Oh, God...

00:25.290 --> 00:27.281
Okay, no.
Oh, come on, Dana.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.720
We said no as long
as we were coworkers.
Yeah, we...

00:29.760 --> 00:31.318
we're still coworkers.
Yeah,

00:31.360 --> 00:33.624
for one more week.
Not to be too much
of a pessrmlst,

00:33.660 --> 00:35.218
but I don't think _
you're gonna surVIve It.

00:35.260 --> 00:36.295
Oh, really?
Yeah. You're like

00:36.330 --> 00:38.161
a cop with one week
left on the job.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.360
They all get shot.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.662
Can't risk the wait.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.305
Cary, I have
a boyfriend.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.637
So do I.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.308
(laughing)

00:46.340 --> 00:47.671
Well, my guess
is my boyfriend's

00:47.710 --> 00:49.803
bigger than yours.
Oh.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.444
Okay.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.619
These cases, I can't
finish in a week.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.743
I will them to you.
Oh... great.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.679
No sex and half your
file work-- I really
feel like I'm losing here.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.087
Yeah, but you have one
less body to step over
on your way to the top.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.529
(phone rings)
Must be your boyfriend.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.529
(giggling)
Checking in on me.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.721
Hello, dear.
How are you?

01:10.770 --> 01:12.692
I'm good, Cary.
How about you?

01:12.740 --> 01:13.695
I'm good, Matan.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.230
Really? You and Matan?

01:15.270 --> 01:16.430
I just got a call about

01:16.470 --> 01:19.701
an ASA needed at a crime scene
for some kind of legal issue.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.605
I was gonna head down,
but it turns out

01:21.640 --> 01:24.370
Lockhart & Gardner
are the defense attorneys on it.

01:24.410 --> 01:25.638
So lucky you.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.375
What's the legal issue?

01:27.420 --> 01:28.569
No idea.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.144
(groans)

01:30.190 --> 01:31.316
This sounds like hazing.

01:31.350 --> 01:32.214
It does, doesn't it?

01:32.260 --> 01:35.354
Let me give you
the address, dear.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.483
ALICIA:
And that's all I do?
ZACH: That's all you do.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.724
Just hit the return key,

01:38.760 --> 01:40.398
and it's on your
computer at work.

01:40.430 --> 01:42.261
But why does it never
seem so simple?

01:42.300 --> 01:44.689
Because you don't
trust technology.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.699
Hey, you guys have
all your bags packed
and ready, right?

01:47.740 --> 01:49.662
Because Dad's gonna
be here any minute.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.337
Hey M
, om?
Yes? I

01:51.370 --> 01:53.907
What do you do when
we're at Dad's?

01:53.940 --> 01:55.430
What do I do?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.742
Uh, not much.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.748
I miss you two.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.611
For about an hour.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.686
And then I do
some laundry,

02:02.720 --> 02:04.483
I read for work. Why?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.579
Do you ever go out?

02:06.620 --> 02:09.487
Uh, for dinner?
Sometimes.
With friends?

02:09.530 --> 02:11.259
Sometimes.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.791
What friends?

02:12.830 --> 02:14.718
Friends from work.
Or clients.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.421
People we know?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.367
No, I don't think you do.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.334
(phone rings)

02:21.370 --> 02:23.258
We're just worried
about you, Mom.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.870
(laughs) Honey...
I'm fine. Really.

02:25.910 --> 02:27.377
Mom, it's work.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.399
Will Gardner.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.374
Okay, thanks.

02:30.410 --> 02:33.277
I-I'm gonna...
just take that in there.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.444
Hang it up.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.742
I was.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.745
WILL:
Sorry about

02:37.790 --> 02:38.586
calling you at home.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.258
No problem.
Everything all right?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.587
Yes. Actually,
this is about work.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.588
Oh. Good.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.325
I mean, I'm here.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.295
Your new hire, the first-year?
Caitlin.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.968
Yes. A call came in about
the Jin-Pyn account.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.228
She was the only one here.

02:51.270 --> 02:53.795
She went out on it, but I think
she'll need some hand-holding.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.899
Oh, o-okay.
Um, what's it about?

02:55.940 --> 02:59.398
No idea. But the son seems to be
in some kind of legal trouble.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.600
GRACE (in background):
Mom! It's Dad!

03:00.640 --> 03:02.369
I'll be right there.

03:02.410 --> 03:03.843
Do you have the address?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.871
DANA:
Should have guessed.

03:05.910 --> 03:07.514
What?

03:07.550 --> 03:08.869
Booze cruise.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.684
$50, all the beer
you can drink.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.314
OFFICER: Down there.
(clears throat)

03:15.360 --> 03:16.827
CARY:
You did that in college?

03:16.860 --> 03:19.226
DANA:
I did a lot
of things in college.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.637
Only one band.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.866
A seasickness band.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.470
You wear them in pairs.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.444
You're not gonna leave.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.947
You're too
good at this.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.518
That's what they say to the cop
with only one week left.

03:41.550 --> 03:42.710
MAN:
Five miles out

03:42.750 --> 03:46.516
someone found the deceased,
a Maya Nichols, below deck,

03:46.560 --> 03:48.312
called the police.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.282
Witnesses say she was
getting unwanted attention

03:50.330 --> 03:51.479
from two college kids.

03:51.530 --> 03:55.352
We were just about to haul 'em
in for a suspect rape exam

03:55.400 --> 03:57.368
when this joker showed up.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.436
You are the
authority here?
(mutters)

03:59.470 --> 04:01.461
I am. What seems
to be the problem?

04:01.500 --> 04:04.003
The problem is,
Mr. Anders is the son
of a Dutch courier

04:04.040 --> 04:06.838
at our embassy, and
is therefore covered
by diplomatic Immunity.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.508
I was not there!
I was not!
These are my papers,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.745
and these are the
papers of Mr. Anders.
Who's that?

04:11.780 --> 04:13.543
DETECTIVE:
Uh, Jin-Pyn.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.673
Supposedly, he's got
diplomatic immunity, too.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.280
Chinese ambassador's
on his way.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.584
Per the_ Viennese Convention
on Diplomatic Relations,

04:20.620 --> 04:22.451
Mr. Anders is to
be treated...

04:22.490 --> 04:24.458
Yes, I heard you.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.526
Thought there was some
Lockhart/Gardner connection.
CAITLIN: Yes.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.959
Me. Here.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.365
I don't think I know you.
You don't.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.867
Caitlin D'Arcy.
I'm new as of last week.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.494
Okay. Well, what do
you have to offer?

04:33.540 --> 04:36.634
Nothing. I'm just taping
everything you do.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.335
Well, uh...

04:40.380 --> 04:42.803
I'm Cary Agos, and...
these two youths

04:42.850 --> 04:44.147
are under investigation
for rape and murder.

04:44.180 --> 04:47.616
They have legal immunity.
From prosecution,
not investigation.

04:47.650 --> 04:49.584
So unless they want to confess,
I'm investigating.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.939
Go ahead, Detective,
take them in.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.412
This is illegal.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.315
Now, who is your boss?
The People of Illinois.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.419
You want their number?

04:59.530 --> 05:01.555
You feeling pretty
good about yourself?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.398
Yeah, but how do I look?

05:13.610 --> 05:16.670
(indistinct chatter)
(footsteps approaching)

05:16.710 --> 05:18.974
Caitlin, what's
going on?
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.046
He's being accused
of rape and murder.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.583
Have you told
him his rights?
I was asked

05:23.620 --> 05:25.588
to stand outside--
they're donng a
suspect exam.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.088
Chen, my name is
Alicia Florrick.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.656
I'm your parents' lawyer.

05:29.690 --> 05:32.488
It is your right to have me
observe the suspect exam.

05:32.530 --> 05:33.758
Do you approve?

05:33.800 --> 05:36.428
I, uh... yeah.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.063
DETECTIVE:
Ma'am, please,
step back through.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.829
It is his Sixth Amendment
right that I be here.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.134
Chen, did they tell you you
had the right to remain silent?

05:43.170 --> 05:44.660
I didn't do it.
I know.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.575
I need you to only talk to me.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.679
Do you understand?
I promised Dick

05:47.710 --> 05:49.075
I wouldn't talk.
Here. Left earring stud.

05:50.610 --> 05:51.907
Blond hair,
two inches long.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.372
CAITLIN:
Mrs. Florrick?

05:53.420 --> 05:55.638
I'm from the
Dutch embassy.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.614
I'm here to _see Mr. Anders.
We're getting everything
sorted out, sir.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.639
Who's the ASA?

05:58.690 --> 06:00.385
I am. Who are you?

06:00.420 --> 06:01.648
Judge Winter.
Oh.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.726
I'm-I'm sorry. I...
ALICIA:
Your Honor,

06:03.760 --> 06:05.853
I represent
Mr. Chen Jin-Pyn.

06:05.890 --> 06:07.858
_He is the son of
a diplomatic translator,

06:07.900 --> 06:09.458
_and therefore
IS guaranteed...

06:09.500 --> 06:11.695
Yes, and that's why I was
yanked out of my house

06:11.730 --> 06:13.197
in the middle
of the night.
Where is he?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.561
Your Honor, there is strong
evidence that these two men
raped and kIlled...

06:15.600 --> 06:17.534
I'm sorry to say
that's not relevant.

06:17.570 --> 06:20.869
Given their immunity status,
you have no right to hold them.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.174
This is a _court _
order requmng their
immediate release.

06:23.210 --> 06:27.112
Your Honor. Cary, you can
hold one of them. Taiwan.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.310
Uh, Your Honor,

06:28.350 --> 06:30.739
excuse me, I-I understand we
have to release Mr. Dick Anders,

06:30.790 --> 06:33.611
given his status
as a Dutch citizen, but Jin-Pyn

06:33.660 --> 06:34.786
is Taiwanese,
and Taiwan enjoys

06:34.820 --> 06:36.549
no such diplomatic status.
How is that?

06:36.590 --> 06:38.581
The One China rule.
The U.S. Government

06:38.630 --> 06:40.894
extends diplomatic relations
to China but not Taiwan.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.626
Your Honor, this
is a gray area.
Not in matters

06:43.670 --> 06:44.762
of diplomatic immunity.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.064
Taiwan is the only nation
not accorded such rights.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.633
Your Honor, this isn't
the United Nations.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.138
You can't just keep one
and let the other go.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.772
Actually, that's
exactly what I can do.

06:54.810 --> 06:57.199
I order the release of
Mr. Anders but not Mr. Jin-Pyn.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.206
That is unfair, Your Honor.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.174
Good luck, buddy.
I'm out of here.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.609
Of course it is.
When have you ever known

07:04.650 --> 07:06.789
international politics
to be fair.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.766
Well, you really stirred up
the hornet's next.

07:25.810 --> 07:27.675
It was a rape-murder--
I held both suspects

07:27.710 --> 07:30.042
as long as I could.
So, where are we?

07:30.080 --> 07:32.810
No semen, but we believe
it was an attempted rape;

07:32.850 --> 07:35.011
she resisted;
Chen killed her.
Murder weapon?

07:35.050 --> 07:36.813
None found.
Blunt head trauma.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.943
DIANE: What does the
client say happened?

07:38.990 --> 07:40.514
Caitlin?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.755
He says they both
flirted with the victim,

07:42.790 --> 07:44.985
and then his friend Anders
went off with her.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.657
But we can't get to Anders?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.053
ALICIA:
No, he was released.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.499
Well, that's not good.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.020
What else ties him to the girl?

07:51.070 --> 07:54.096
The blond hair caught
in Chen's left earring stud.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.835
MATAN:
No pubic hair?
None.

07:55.870 --> 07:58.600
Oh, Dana, you're still here.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.676
Six more days of bliss.
Any blood spatter?

08:00.710 --> 08:03.178
On Chen, no.
What do you think
the defense will be?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.075
To blame the one that got away.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.169
Too bad there's one
that got away.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.744
And our strategy?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.247
ALICIA: Connect Anders
to the rape.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.281
Did the police
do a suspect exam?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.754
On Anders, no.
He was released prior.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.621
Hm. And what about
the blond hair on our guy?

08:16.660 --> 08:19.151
How does he explain that?
CAITLIN: Chen says
they made out.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.122
It was consensual.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.663
Then Chen went to go
buy the victim a drink,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.258
and Anders took
her below deck.
A drink?

08:24.300 --> 08:26.632
I thought it was a booze cruise.
ALICIA: Just
beer and wine.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.796
Hard alcohol,
you had to pay.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.898
We have Chen's
credit card receipt

08:28.940 --> 08:31.158
with the time on it,
so if they police can pinpoint

08:31.210 --> 08:32.632
the time of the murder,
we can prove

08:32.680 --> 08:36.571
that Chen was on the
other end of the boat.
Eli Gold, ladies and gentlemen.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.318
You needed me?

08:40.350 --> 08:43.649
You push this off on me
and then you criticize
my handling of it?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.112
I wasn't trying
to criticize you.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.583
Did I give you
that impression?

08:46.620 --> 08:47.951
You did.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.821
My apologies.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.828
ELI:
What was that about?

08:52.860 --> 08:56.569
We were trying to make
you feel part of the
Lockhart/Gardner family.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.625
Don't you want
to feel a part?

08:58.670 --> 09:00.228
Oh. I'm okay.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.862
What do you need?

09:01.900 --> 09:04.937
Lobbying. The son
of a Taiwanese diplomat

09:04.970 --> 09:08.576
is being denied immunity
from prosecution due to
the One China rule.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.204
Oy. That thicket.
Yep, that thicket.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.138
I thought if you
could talk to someone

09:13.180 --> 09:16.581
quietly, we could make this
go away without much fuss.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.214
Know anyone in
the State Department?

09:21.220 --> 09:23.279
Yes?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.628
Nothing.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.753
How important is it?
Well,

09:27.800 --> 09:31.327
heading into the presidential
campaign, my guess is

09:31.370 --> 09:34.339
Taiwan will be spending
a lot on U.S. lobbyists.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.338
Could be lucrative...

09:36.370 --> 09:37.667
for you.

09:39.810 --> 09:42.608
Okay.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.244
This is not going to be pretty.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.976
Sorry you had to see that.
Definitely not my finest hour.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.817
No, it's cool.
You were a good judge.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.340
Okay, the less said
about that, the better.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.358
(clears throat)
Oh, Alicia, hey.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.950
Mr. Gardner was a judge in my
intercollegiate moot court.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.184
Really?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.858
Mm-hmm.
Till I was removed. Bias.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.299
Yeah, they had, like,
some 60-year-old come in.

10:01.330 --> 10:02.729
Aanay. . .

10:02.770 --> 10:04.726
Yeah. Caitlin.
Oh, sorry.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.362
Orientation,
right?
Go get orientated.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.665
So, this binder has all
your human resource forms,

10:09.710 --> 10:12.679
a fax sheet on billing,
ABA, pro bono requirements.

10:12.710 --> 10:13.972
Great, thanks.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.035
He's nice, isn't he?
Who, Will Gardner?

10:16.080 --> 10:18.173
Yes. So is Diane.
They're both also busy.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.678
So if there's
anything you need,
you come to me first.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.848
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I
just embarrass myself?
No, no, no, you did fine.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.209
Oh, God, I did, didn't I?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.650
Caitlin, you were fine.
Here, work over here.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.885
Go ahead, start
filling these out.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.766
Hello?

10:36.800 --> 10:38.324
Thanks a lot.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.361
Excuse me.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.537
This is my office.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.834
Then I guess you can do
whatever you want, can't you?

10:43.870 --> 10:45.064
I...

10:45.110 --> 10:46.668
May I help you?

10:46.710 --> 10:48.337
Not anymore.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.302
Next time you need help
with IT, call me.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.409
You don't just do it
on your own.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.418
Look at this. Look.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.111
What did you do?

10:56.150 --> 10:57.310
What did I do?

10:57.350 --> 10:59.386
What did 1...? Okay.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.456
It's your cloud, lady.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.355
Go live on it.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.286
Right there. Her. Closer.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.719
Hey, do you know how
I get to the zoo?

11:08.760 --> 11:09.988
(scoffs)

11:10.030 --> 11:12.794
So you just troll along the
lakefront looking for ex-wives?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.068
No, just you.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.159
(laughs)
Your office told me
you'd be here.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.009
(sighs)
So...

11:18.040 --> 11:19.735
Wow, you're reallyslowing down,
aren't you?

11:19.780 --> 11:22.078
(laughs)

11:22.110 --> 11:24.249
I'll just be a minute.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.875
How's the presidential
campaign going?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.217
Why? What did you hear?

11:29.250 --> 11:31.047
Oh, God, you're paranoid.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.285
No, I'm a vegetarian.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.878
Since when?

11:34.920 --> 11:36.057
Since we divorced.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.785
What do you need?

11:37.830 --> 11:41.049
Who do you know at State?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.988
A lot of people.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.395
It's a Taiwan issue.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.729
A poor, innocent kid's
been accused of...

11:47.770 --> 11:49.260
something or other,

11:49.300 --> 11:51.006
and they won't grant him
diplomatic immunity.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.201
Do you want me to talk
to Doug Rothstein?

11:53.240 --> 11:56.744
Yeah. Really?

11:56.780 --> 11:59.078
That'd be great.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.088
You're-you're looking
good, Vanessa.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.382
(laughs)

12:04.420 --> 12:05.887
Eli?

12:06.990 --> 12:09.015
Your turn.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.099
Do you know Kim Kesler?

12:14.130 --> 12:16.121
Kim... Kesler?
Who's she?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.492
He. A political op
out of California.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.361
I thought you guys
were all staffed up.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.265
It's not for
the president.
Who then?

12:22.300 --> 12:23.528
Me.

12:23.570 --> 12:24.832
(laughs)

12:24.870 --> 12:26.167
(both laugh)

12:26.210 --> 12:28.178
Seriously, Vanessa?

12:28.210 --> 12:29.472
(laughs)

12:29.510 --> 12:31.978
Seriously?
Yeah.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.272
He-He approached me.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.776
State Senate.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.141
Oh, my God, you have
that wild look in your eye.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.839
Rahm gets in,
and everybody thinks they can.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.915
It's a good time
for a woman.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.279
Is that what
Kim Kesler told you--

12:42.320 --> 12:43.821
the man with a woman's name?

12:43.860 --> 12:46.021
I need your help, Eli--
your professional opinion.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.493
Meet us for dinner tonight.

12:47.530 --> 12:48.656
Kim Kesler.
Kick his tires.

12:48.700 --> 12:52.158
See if he's real, or if he's
selling me a bill of goods.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.134
I can't believe _
you're conSIdering this.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.138
I want to do
something with my life.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.933
You always used to say that.

12:57.970 --> 12:59.972
Well, now I mean it.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.148
We're not having a moment.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.841
No, no, we're not.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.074
I'm-I'm going, I'm going.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.545
Mrs. Florrick,
can I show you something?

13:12.590 --> 13:14.455
What is it, Caitlin?
I'm a little busy.

13:14.490 --> 13:15.889
It's probably
nothing, but I think

13:15.920 --> 13:17.581
I have something on
the consensual. Chen.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.382
We have to prove that he made
out with her consensually.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.125
Oh. Sure.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.469
Okay, so I was looking

13:23.500 --> 13:27.095
at AfterDeathSpace for
Maya, the dead girl.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.960
Oh, AfterDeathSpace.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.002
You know, when
someone dies,

13:31.040 --> 13:33.474
and everybody wants to
share stories and photos.

13:33.510 --> 13:34.875
Okay.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.275
And what was cool is,

13:36.310 --> 13:39.347
everybody at the booze
cruise was tweeting photos.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.847
And so look.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.984
But what was even more cool
is... look.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.113
The color of her cup-- red.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.856
Okay.

13:46.890 --> 13:47.982
It's a stoplight party,
not a spectrum party.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.510
A...?
A stoplight party

13:49.560 --> 13:52.893
Oh, you carry a red cup
to say you're in a relationship,

13:52.930 --> 13:54.488
a yellow cup
to say you're choosy,

13:54.530 --> 13:56.828
and a green cup to
say you're open.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.891
But see?

14:00.940 --> 14:02.965
This one's from later--

14:03.010 --> 14:04.966
an hour after the first pic.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.308
And look at her cup.
Now it's green.

14:07.340 --> 14:08.932
Well, maybe it's a mistake.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.538
Take my word for it.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.002
You know what cup
you're carrying

14:12.050 --> 14:13.449
at a stoplight party.

14:13.480 --> 14:18.144
So what made her switch
from a red cup to a green one?

14:18.190 --> 14:20.249
(whistle blows)
Yeah, got it. Red to green.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.088
Okay, listen,
I'll call you back.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.156
Hi.
Hey.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.090
So you're not
with the police?

14:28.130 --> 14:29.961
No. You're Maya's
boyfriend, right?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.935
Yeah. I was.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.995
I already talked to the cops.
I wasn't there.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.393
But you were on the phone
with her, right?

14:36.440 --> 14:37.998
At the booze cruise.
She called you from it

14:38.040 --> 14:39.007
the night she died.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.268
So?

14:40.310 --> 14:42.608
Well, you broke up with her
on the phone.
No.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.301
Listen, you're safe from arrest.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.669
Just tell me the truth.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.938
Iam.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.345
She broke up with me.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.938
She said she
was tired of me

14:49.990 --> 14:51.139
spending all my time
with this waitress

14:51.190 --> 14:53.954
I know from Ra Sushi, but
she was this mother of three,

14:53.990 --> 14:56.208
really nice, and Ijust like
talking to her, you know?

14:56.260 --> 14:58.683
Sure. Um...
And she wanted to be
a philosophy major, too,

14:58.730 --> 15:00.095
back_when she
was in college.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.324
It's not like I'm a
philosophy major yet.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.657
I'm still undecided
about my major.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.520
Sure, look, don't
worry about that.
Ijust like talking to her.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.526
But you talked to her?

15:06.570 --> 15:09.095
Who, the waitress?
No. Maya.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.961
When she broke up with you,
you talked to her, right?

15:12.010 --> 15:13.170
Yeah, yeah.

15:13.210 --> 15:14.973
I mean, no, no.
She, um...

15:15.010 --> 15:17.046
She_left me
a v0ice mail.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.342
Do you have it?

15:18.380 --> 15:20.177
MAYA:
You are so full of yourself.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.279
You think
I can't do any guy here?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.083
Can you e-mail me
that voice mail?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.189
Yeah, sure.
Does it help?

15:25.220 --> 15:26.448
Yeah, it does.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.082
There's more if you want.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.224
MAYA:
Your phone just keeps
cutting me off.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.579
I just want... Hey!

15:31.630 --> 15:33.257
I said, don't touch me.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.995
CHEN:
What? I'm not touching you.

15:35.030 --> 15:36.327
(turns message off)

15:36.360 --> 15:37.622
What's wrong?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.092
Nothing.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.734
Did you play that
for anyone else?

15:40.770 --> 15:43.000
Yeah.
VVho?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.632
MAYA:
Hey! I said, don't touch me.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.069
CHEN:
What? I'm not touching you.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.236
DANA:
That's Chen.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.305
Sounds like
unwanted attention to me.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.648
There goes consensual for them.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.375
We should make an offer.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.116
Life? No chance of parole?

15:54.150 --> 15:55.344
Hey, Cary.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.041
Sorry to interrupt.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.012
We're gonna be shuffling
the offices around a bit,

15:59.050 --> 16:00.711
so if you could get your stuff

16:00.760 --> 16:03.251
together and be ready
in the next few days, okay?

16:03.290 --> 16:04.484
Uh, this is from Peter?

16:04.530 --> 16:07.055
Yup, he delegated to me.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.652
What's going on there?

16:09.700 --> 16:12.396
It's a guy thing.
Office jockeying.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.137
I don't think they can put you
in any smaller of an office.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.058
Oh, they can.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.148
Hello.

16:26.180 --> 16:29.047
Oh, my mom's just downstairs.

16:32.050 --> 16:34.052
You're Zach, right?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.658
I'm Will Gardner,
your mom's boss.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.658
Oh.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.157
Hey.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.364
So, no school today, huh?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.038
(laughs)

16:48.070 --> 16:49.537
No, there was.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.138
Oh, it's 4:00.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.375
Helping Mom out?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.482
Yeah.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.478
Well...

17:09.520 --> 17:11.522
keep on keepin' on.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.593
You should know something
about your friend, Cary.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.608
My friend, Cary?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.107
Yeah, you should know something.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.370
He has a thing
for ethnic women.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.105
Oh. Really?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.048
Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.208
Every black or Hispanic woman
through here.

17:34.250 --> 17:38.209
Wow. Well, thank you
for the warning.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.623
Got it working.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.127
You did not.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.391
I did. The IT guy put on
proprietary software,

17:52.430 --> 17:55.399
so he could charge your firm
for every megabyte he stored.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.159
That's why it rejected the
transferring of your files.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.268
What? I don't understand.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.732
It's really corrupt.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.305
You don't need
to be paying to store files.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.204
In fact, it slows
the system down.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.877
Really?
Yeah.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.810
Oh, your boss was in here. Will.

18:08.850 --> 18:12.149
Yes, I-I saw.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.158
Did you say hi?

18:14.190 --> 18:15.555
I did.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.498
All right, I better go.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.157
Okay. I love you.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.328
Love you, too.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.331
Yeah?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.632
I want a car.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.778
MAN:
It's like Moneyball.

18:39.810 --> 18:42.347
Politics doesn't have
to be for the rich.

18:42.380 --> 18:46.248
It's the true_ democratization
of power in this country.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.349
You have citizen
engagement on one hand.

18:48.390 --> 18:49.482
Megatrend, right?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.522
I mean, everybody's
talking about it.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.790
Mark Penn, so on,

18:53.830 --> 18:55.889
and I'm not even
talking about RTR.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.194
(laughs):
I mean, talk about
real Moneyball.

18:58.230 --> 18:59.424
RTR?

18:59.470 --> 19:01.529
Oh. Jeez.
Real-Time Response.

19:01.570 --> 19:05.267
(slams table)
They hit Vanessa, and
bam, we hit back. Bam!

19:05.310 --> 19:07.870
We hit back.

19:07.910 --> 19:09.878
Through?

19:09.910 --> 19:12.344
Micro-pockets
of committed,

19:12.380 --> 19:15.269
citizen, online
journalist bloggers.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.481
Each talking from a subset
of their own communities.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.943
Let's say we have upstate
agricultural sections, right?

19:19.990 --> 19:21.810
We also_have_ the
urban Cities, right?

19:21.860 --> 19:23.282
We have activated
in there...

19:23.330 --> 19:24.729
Well, that went well.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.352
(both laughing)

19:26.390 --> 19:27.425
You're not going with him.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.927
This was all a joke, right?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.224
He was trying to impress you.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.431
Oh, my God, Vanessa,
he is a clown.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.734
(both laugh)

19:35.770 --> 19:37.806
Then help me.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.501
You were never going with him?

19:40.540 --> 19:42.576
(laughing):
Are you kidding?

19:42.610 --> 19:44.544
Citizen engagement, RTR.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.241
He just gave me the bug.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.647
So this was all so I
would agree to help you?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.240
I'm not going to be your
campaign manager, Vanessa.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.848
I know.

19:53.890 --> 19:56.256
Just get me started.
Do some polling.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.554
See if there's any interest,
that's all.

19:58.590 --> 20:01.423
See if I have the stomach
for this.
You don't.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.291
Well, then, it'll be over fast.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.305
So, what happened with
the State Department?

20:10.340 --> 20:12.934
Oh, yeah, good news.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.848
Hello?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.539
The State Department
screwed you.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.387
They're pushing
for Chen's release.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.388
They don't want
to isolate Taiwan.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.455
There's a hearing tomorrow.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.299
Damn it.
He's guilty.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.355
We just... We just
got this voice mail.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.367
It's a slam dunk.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.766
Yeah. Too bad.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.496
Good, you got
your stuff together.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.963
I have another office
for you down the hall.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.846
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

20:56.880 --> 20:57.983
MAN: _
I extend my Sincere gratitude

20:58.020 --> 20:59.487
to each and every one of you

20:59.520 --> 21:00.657
for being here tonight.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.749
(indistinct voices)

21:04.360 --> 21:05.850
So he doesn't expect me?

21:05.890 --> 21:08.597
No, but he's cool--
an old family friend.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.518
Just don't get
rambly on him.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.390
Uncle Dan.

21:12.430 --> 21:13.328
Hey,
how you doing?
Dana.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.429
(both chuckle)

21:15.470 --> 21:16.732
Look at you.

21:16.770 --> 21:17.930
Dad told me you
were in town.

21:17.970 --> 21:20.473
You've, uh,
caught me playing hooky.

21:20.510 --> 21:23.001
The same stump speech
the 18th time,

21:23.040 --> 21:24.405
and you're allowed
a little leeway.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.474
Know what I mean?

21:25.510 --> 21:27.444
Oh, this is,
this is Cary.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.016
Uh, nice to meet you, sir.

21:29.050 --> 21:31.086
Oh, ignore him-- he
calls everybody sir.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.519
It's the straight,
suburban thing.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.517
Uh-huh.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.881
Uncle Daniel works
in the Obama State Department.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.423
Well, that sounds
deathly formal.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.349
So it's true--
you did break up with Jimi?

21:43.630 --> 21:45.689
No, we're just...

21:45.730 --> 21:46.697
(laughs)

21:46.730 --> 21:48.061
It's complicated.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.590
Uh-huh.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.039
Aanay, Cary and
I work together

21:51.070 --> 21:52.469
at the state's
attorney's office.
Oh, yeah,

21:52.510 --> 21:53.260
Peter-- how's he doing?

21:53.310 --> 21:55.039
We worked together
a long time ago.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.433
Good,
he's good,

21:56.480 --> 21:57.708
he's good, but we're
working on a case

21:57.750 --> 21:58.808
involving the
One China rule.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.647
Really?

22:00.680 --> 22:02.477
Well, that I have
to hear all about.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.889
Good job.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.512
Ah, thanks,
not too rambly?

22:07.560 --> 22:11.883
(chuckles)
Surprisingly not.

22:11.930 --> 22:15.696
So Matan says that you have
a thing for ethnic women.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.027
He what?

22:17.060 --> 22:20.029
He says you have a
thing for ethnic women.

22:20.070 --> 22:21.492
You just can't control
yourself around us.

22:21.540 --> 22:25.533
Oh, I...
that's not true.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.871
Unless that's
a good thing.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.571
That depends.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.411
On...?

22:54.770 --> 22:56.738
ELI:
I want you to vet

22:56.770 --> 22:58.533
my ex-wife.

22:58.570 --> 23:00.401
(clicking tongue)

23:00.440 --> 23:01.737
Really?

23:01.780 --> 23:03.133
Yeah, I know

23:03.180 --> 23:05.398
it sounds a bit weird, but
she's thinking of running

23:05.450 --> 23:07.145
for state senate and
she wants me to vet her.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.478
All right, well,
I have to do some work

23:09.520 --> 23:11.681
on Taiwan first,
but then, sure.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.688
How, how thorough
should I be?

23:13.720 --> 23:15.483
As thorough
as her enemies would be.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.522
Okay.

23:19.790 --> 23:23.567
Um... this isn't
about something else?

23:23.600 --> 23:25.659
You mean, am I jealous
of my wife

23:25.700 --> 23:27.167
and want to see _
who she's sleeping With?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.565
No.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.602
Okay.

23:30.640 --> 23:31.834
(taps key)

23:31.870 --> 23:33.508
(tapping key repeatedly)

23:33.540 --> 23:35.531
Oh, come on!

23:35.580 --> 23:36.808
(banging gavel)

23:36.840 --> 23:38.899
So this is a hearing
into the status

23:38.950 --> 23:41.510
of Mr. Jin-Pyn's
diplomatic...

23:41.550 --> 23:43.609
status.

23:43.650 --> 23:44.548
Don't worry, Chen,

23:44.590 --> 23:46.649
you have the backing
of the state department.

23:46.690 --> 23:47.850
CHEN:
Thank you.

23:47.890 --> 23:51.621
I can't spend
another day in here.

23:51.660 --> 23:54.595
I don't know, they're smiling
like they know something.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.188
Now let's begin.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.460
I understand the
defense has a witness.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.958
Yes, Your Honor, it is our
contention that protections

24:02.000 --> 24:04.730
of diplomatic immunity
were denied our client

24:04.770 --> 24:07.000
due to the peculiarities
of Taiwan.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.736
To that end,
we have asked a spokes...

24:11.850 --> 24:14.478
Ma'am, there's a call
from the state department.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.545
A Mr. Daniel Golden would like
to speak with you.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.617
...a spokeswoman
at the state department...

24:19.650 --> 24:21.550
JUDGE:
Yes, Counselor?

24:23.560 --> 24:25.755
Excuse me, Your Honor,
if we could delay...

24:25.790 --> 24:27.121
As long as you want, Counselor.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.758
Um, actually, Your Honor, we ask
the court that reasonable bail

24:36.800 --> 24:37.835
be set,

24:37.870 --> 24:39.667
and we would have
no objection to make

24:39.710 --> 24:41.701
home confinement
a condition.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.906
What happened?

24:45.950 --> 24:46.905
ELI:
State worried

24:46.950 --> 24:49.145
that extending
diplomatic immunity to the kid

24:49.180 --> 24:51.045
would be a slap
in the face to China.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.682
(groans)

24:52.720 --> 24:54.551
(indistinct chatter)

24:54.590 --> 24:57.627
Okay, we have
to get discovery.

24:57.660 --> 25:00.823
None of your hair was
found on the body, Chen,

25:00.860 --> 25:03.658
but we did just get
the lab report back

25:03.700 --> 25:04.667
on the trace evidence.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.533
There was a blond hair--
not Maya's, a man's--

25:07.570 --> 25:08.594
on her collar.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.629
They don't know
who it matches.

25:09.670 --> 25:10.637
Anders.

25:10.670 --> 25:11.568
That's what
we think,

25:11.610 --> 25:13.703
but the police didn't
do his suspect exam,

25:13.740 --> 25:15.139
so we have nothing
to match it to.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.135
Do you have anything of his?

25:16.180 --> 25:19.149
Anything that might have
one of his hairs on it--

25:19.180 --> 25:21.045
a brush or an item of clothing?

25:21.080 --> 25:24.117
I know his gym locker
combination at school.

25:24.150 --> 25:25.947
KALIN DA:
My brother left

25:25.990 --> 25:27.287
all my things
in his locker.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.287
He gave me

25:28.320 --> 25:29.287
the combination.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.753
I'll be right in and out.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.855
Thanks.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.654
It's the other
seasickness band, Cary.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.725
How do I know you didn't
plant it there, Kalinda?

26:09.760 --> 26:11.159
Because I didn't.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.792
Uh-huh, and you just
happened to know

26:12.830 --> 26:13.865
the number
of Anders' locker?

26:13.900 --> 26:15.959
No, I just happen to be
a very good investigator.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.729
Look, check
if you don't believe me.

26:17.770 --> 26:18.839
(sighs)
I'll get back to you.

26:18.870 --> 26:19.939
Okay, whatever.

26:19.970 --> 26:23.701
We're all having
to make sacrifices,

26:23.750 --> 26:25.706
but you have a
window now at least.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.739
That one.

26:27.780 --> 26:30.010
The cubicle
in the middle.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.587
Thanks.

26:33.990 --> 26:35.958
You're welcome.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.924
Hi, uh, sorry
to keep you waiting.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.723
No problem, I
keep myself busy.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.694
You have a
pretty office.

26:41.730 --> 26:42.890
Thank you.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.761
Start of a campaign,
you work in Versailles.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.791
By the end, you're in Motel 6--

26:46.830 --> 26:48.229
not to disparage
Motel 6.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.965
I'm a politician now.

26:51.010 --> 26:54.798
So, uh, you, uh, married once

26:54.840 --> 26:55.909
to Mr. Gold?

26:55.940 --> 26:58.909
Four happy years, eight
medium ones, and two bad ones.

27:00.210 --> 27:02.747
I hope that doesn't
preclude me from running.
Actually,

27:02.780 --> 27:05.715
I'm not here to make judgment,
just, just questions.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.411
So why did you guys break up?

27:07.450 --> 27:09.350
Uh, I think that was
in the divorce settlement.

27:09.390 --> 27:12.257
Actually, it wasn't, just
"irreconcilable differences."

27:12.290 --> 27:13.928
Ah, well, that's what it was.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.952
Yeah, but I think
we'll need to go deeper.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.769
Okay, uh, we were both
working too hard.

27:27.810 --> 27:30.802
I was having to take a lot
of trips out of town.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.148
Yeah, uh, Dubai,
three trips.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.147
Yes.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.819
At that time, I was doing
PR for an oil company.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.112
And who did you
meet there?

27:38.150 --> 27:39.117
Who did I meet?

27:39.150 --> 27:41.209
I-- do you want
an itemized list?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.888
Yeah.

27:43.930 --> 27:44.828
Just write
down the ones

27:44.860 --> 27:46.725
that you remember.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.456
Are you looking
for anyone in particular?

27:49.500 --> 27:53.698
Yeah, uh, Omar Tate.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.958
You're doing
his dirty work for him,

27:58.010 --> 27:59.864
aren't you?

27:59.910 --> 28:01.036
Eli's dirty work.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.229
No.
He told you

28:02.280 --> 28:03.178
to ask me that.

28:03.210 --> 28:07.101
No, my vetting is
independent of Mr. Gold.

28:07.150 --> 28:08.742
I don't believe you.
I understand that,

28:08.780 --> 28:10.247
but it's true.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.258
(sighs)

28:14.290 --> 28:17.111
It was a mistake,
Omar was a mistake.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.458
Uh, how many times
did you meet?

28:20.490 --> 28:21.696
Don't tell him.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.796
I was young.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.491
This is, this is merely
part of the vetting.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.930
Don't tell him.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.961
Please.

28:40.050 --> 28:41.244
Yeah, I was
on the booze cruise, too,

28:41.280 --> 28:43.339
but I just remember seeing
Maya by the bar.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.984
ALICIA:
Did you see her with this man?

28:45.020 --> 28:47.386
No.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.388
I mean, I saw him
in the newspaper,

28:49.420 --> 28:51.888
but I didn't see
them leave together.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.352
I mean, we were
both worried

28:53.390 --> 28:55.096
about getting
disconnected at parties,

28:55.130 --> 28:56.859
so we always
kept track.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.118
CAITLIN:
How did you keep track?

28:59.170 --> 29:01.161
Oh, you know,
that app.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.167
What app?

29:02.200 --> 29:03.394
The rape app?

29:03.440 --> 29:07.206
Have you heard
of it?

29:07.240 --> 29:08.935
No, show me.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.868
We both had it installed
on our phones

29:10.910 --> 29:12.946
so we could keep track
of each other.

29:12.980 --> 29:15.517
See, the GPS shows you
where your friend is.

29:19.550 --> 29:22.212
There's a panic button.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.921
Yeah, I know.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.359
That's what sucks.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.790
The phone vibrated
when Maya pushed it,

29:27.830 --> 29:31.368
but the music was so loud
and I was dancmg,

29:31.400 --> 29:33.322
so I didn't feel it.

29:33.370 --> 29:34.894
(gasps)
What?

29:34.940 --> 29:38.330
It has a history of when
Maya pushed the panic button.

29:38.370 --> 29:41.976
Yeah, I know, but it
didn't show her location.

29:42.010 --> 29:45.309
I know, but it shows what time
she pressed the button.

29:45.350 --> 29:48.513
11:33.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.245
CARY:
Yeah, I do see it.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.248
11:34 pm.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.986
Chen bought a mojito
at 11:34 pm.

29:55.020 --> 29:57.159
Why does that matter?

29:57.190 --> 29:59.158
A rape app?

29:59.190 --> 30:02.489
No, I've never heard
of that.

30:02.530 --> 30:03.997
Okay,

30:04.030 --> 30:05.566
well, if that's
probative,

30:05.600 --> 30:06.897
then the state's
attorney's office

30:06.930 --> 30:08.466
will question her, yep.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.468
Ha-- no, no,
I think

30:10.500 --> 30:12.400
it's a bit too early
to talk about release.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.509
Yeah, okay,
thank you, bye.

30:13.540 --> 30:14.939
What was that?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.174
The defense attorneys.

30:16.210 --> 30:19.270
They say they have
the time of death

30:19.310 --> 30:20.572
via a friend
who received

30:20.610 --> 30:23.340
a signal Maya sent on
something called a rape app.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.415
Do you believe them?

30:24.450 --> 30:26.441
I don't know.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.515
Nice office.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.279
Thanks.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.389
I get a lot more air here.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.177
Chen did it, he did it.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.302
How do you know?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.102
He's Taiwanese-- he would sign

30:53.150 --> 30:55.869
his surname first.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.584
(chuckles)

31:00.620 --> 31:03.282
CARY:
Hey, Dick.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.651
How's it going?

31:04.690 --> 31:06.521
I hear you stopped going
to your anthropology class.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.323
Listen, I don't have
to talk to you.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.055
Actually, you do because
you stopped going

31:10.100 --> 31:11.465
to your anthropology class.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.491
What, what are you
talking about?

31:13.530 --> 31:15.066
You haven't been
in SIX weeks.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.499
Registrar officially
dropped you from the class,

31:16.540 --> 31:17.461
so you're only taking
eight hours now.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.900
Yeah, so, so what?

31:19.940 --> 31:22.431
So diplomatic immunity applies
to diplomats' children

31:22.480 --> 31:23.333
up to the age of 23,

31:23.380 --> 31:25.678
provided they are
full-time students.

31:25.710 --> 31:28.144
You aren't anymore.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.478
I can bring charges against
you any time I want.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.010
I didn't do it.

31:32.050 --> 31:34.553
I believe you, but I think
you know what happened,

31:34.590 --> 31:37.309
and I can make a case
that you were part of it.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.352
Chen grabbed her seasickness
band when he killed her.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.324
Didn't he? And then
he slipped it to you

31:42.360 --> 31:45.090
to hide it, right? Okay.

31:45.130 --> 31:47.564
That's your signature.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.488
You used his credit
card to buy a drink,

31:49.540 --> 31:51.167
and when you looked
up, Chen was gone.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.099
He followed Maya below
deck where he killed her.

31:54.140 --> 31:56.028
So...

31:56.080 --> 31:58.503
it's your choice.

31:58.550 --> 32:02.372
You want to be a witness
or an accomplice?

32:03.720 --> 32:06.541
How much do you want me
to tell you?

32:06.590 --> 32:09.115
Enough to know if
she should run or not.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.128
She shouldn't run.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.479
Okay. Why?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.725
Well, she was
on the organizing board

32:14.760 --> 32:16.489
for a fund-raiser
for Rod Blagojevich.

32:16.530 --> 32:17.690
Old news. What else?

32:17.730 --> 32:19.994
She's had relationships.

32:20.030 --> 32:22.737
I figured. How many?

32:22.770 --> 32:25.034
A few.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.004
But not slut level?

32:27.040 --> 32:28.530
No.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.571
Then we shouldn't
have a problem.

32:33.150 --> 32:36.540
Kalinda, we are doctors
discussing a patient.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.548
What?

32:38.590 --> 32:41.980
Well, one of them
in particular is problematic.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.214
Omar Tate.

32:43.260 --> 32:45.182
He's a financier
of high-end resorts.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.481
What is it? Criminal past?

32:46.530 --> 32:47.656
No.

32:47.690 --> 32:49.453
No, he has a spotless record.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.320
Perfect credit, actually.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.339
Kalinda, you're being weird.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.538
Well, Omar Tate
isn't his birth name.

32:58.570 --> 33:00.538
It's Aarash...

33:00.570 --> 33:02.572
bin Laden.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.578
Come again?

33:06.610 --> 33:10.649
It's Aarash bin Laden,
Osama's second cousin.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.413
My ex-wife slept
with a bin Laden?

33:17.460 --> 33:18.620
Listen, for what it's worth,

33:18.660 --> 33:20.287
Aarash bin Laden
has never been linked

33:20.330 --> 33:22.298
to terrorist activity
of any kind.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.264
Oh, good. She banged
a nice bin Laden.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.666
Uh...

33:26.700 --> 33:28.065
This is absurd.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.136
When was this?

33:30.170 --> 33:31.637
And he has publicly denounced
the actions of al Qaeda.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.604
Wait. When was this?

33:33.640 --> 33:35.733
Uh, you know, I think
the details are in the file.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.133
Kalinda, when was this?

33:38.810 --> 33:41.005
2007.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.451
She was married to me.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.755
I'm sorry.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.701
20 years, and that's my last,
best and final.

34:08.740 --> 34:11.641
That leaves me
nowhere to go, Cary.

34:11.680 --> 34:12.704
Go to your client.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.412
Well, how do you know
Dick's story is reliable?

34:15.450 --> 34:17.372
Nah, I don't have to make
my case to you, Alicia.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.546
Take it or leave it.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.615
But know that
it has a 24-hour clock.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.186
(click)

34:22.220 --> 34:23.653
(phone beeps off)

34:23.690 --> 34:26.329
Very impressive.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.827
You heading out?

34:27.860 --> 34:30.624
Yup. My last week here,
and I haven't been shot.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.661
The day's young yet.

34:36.870 --> 34:38.758
CAITLIN:
Do you think
Dick's telling the truth?

34:38.810 --> 34:40.869
I think he's afraid
of prosecution,

34:40.910 --> 34:42.707
so he'll say
whatever they want.

34:42.740 --> 34:44.844
But it also could
be the truth.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.570
ALICIA:
Is that...?

34:48.620 --> 34:51.612
That-That's him. Chen.

34:51.650 --> 34:54.585
(tires squealing,
engine rewing)

34:54.620 --> 34:56.611
Call him.

34:58.690 --> 35:00.555
(phone ringing)

35:00.590 --> 35:01.727
Damn. It's Cary.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.829
(phone beeps on)
Hello?

35:02.860 --> 35:06.125
CARY:
Alicia, our office
was notified your client

35:06.170 --> 35:07.865
just broke his electronic
perimeter. What's going on?

35:07.900 --> 35:09.390
I-I'm not sure.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.567
Alicia, if you know
your client is attempting

35:11.610 --> 35:13.566
to flee the jurisdiction,
you have

35:13.610 --> 35:15.373
a legal obligation
to report that.

35:15.410 --> 35:16.877
I know my legal
obligations, Cary.

35:16.910 --> 35:18.548
I have not been in touch
with my client.

35:18.580 --> 35:19.706
I will call him

35:19.750 --> 35:20.808
and get back to you.

35:20.850 --> 35:21.817
Alicia...

35:21.850 --> 35:22.839
Let me call him,

35:22.880 --> 35:23.812
and I'll get back to you.

35:23.850 --> 35:24.839
(phone beeps off)

35:24.890 --> 35:26.881
(tires squealing)

35:31.830 --> 35:33.252
Wait. What are you doing?

35:33.290 --> 35:35.258
We're not going
to know where he is.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.565
I don't want to
know where he is.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.261
(phone beeps on)

35:40.300 --> 35:41.437
(phone ringing through)

35:41.470 --> 35:42.596
CARY:
Alicia?

35:42.640 --> 35:43.868
I couldn't reach him.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.438
Tread carefully here, Alicia,
because if you know something,

35:47.470 --> 35:49.438
you're facing obstruction
of justice,

35:49.480 --> 35:50.629
aiding and abetting...

35:50.680 --> 35:52.500
I have not spoken to my client.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.801
Do you know where he is?

35:53.850 --> 35:55.818
Not for certain.

35:55.850 --> 35:57.272
What do you know for certain?

35:57.320 --> 35:59.185
I witnessed an Audi

35:59.220 --> 36:01.188
with a driver_
resembling my client

36:01.220 --> 36:03.279
headed westbound on 90.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.924
He's going to O'Hare.

36:04.960 --> 36:08.726
Again, I do not know that
for certain.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.899
(phone beeps off)

36:11.930 --> 36:14.467
I thought he was innocent.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.831
I know.

36:15.870 --> 36:18.407
Sometimes...

36:18.440 --> 36:20.931
the guilty ones look
like the innocent ones.

36:20.970 --> 36:24.508
Well, that's depressing.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.851
So, what did she tell you?

36:40.890 --> 36:42.994
I don't think you should run.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.669
Why?

36:45.700 --> 36:48.863
How... could you...

36:48.900 --> 36:52.233
fund-raise
for Rod Blagojevich?

36:52.270 --> 36:53.806
(laughs)

36:53.840 --> 36:55.501
I know.

36:55.540 --> 36:56.871
It's dumb, huh?
Yeah.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.798
The voters don't know you.
That'll define you.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.273
You don't think
you could leak it,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.446
take the sting away?

37:02.480 --> 37:04.414
No.

37:04.450 --> 37:06.816
What else, Eli?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.556
Isn't that enough?

37:08.590 --> 37:10.581
No.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.349
She told you?

37:15.900 --> 37:17.993
I don't even know why I care.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.368
The thought that my semen mixed
with bin Laden's.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.664
Come on, Eli,
you know how this works.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.304
Th_e semen _doesn't
just stay in us.

37:27.340 --> 37:28.830
I thought we were happy in 2007.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.279
We were.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.504
It was a mistake.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.676
I loved you, Vanessa.

37:32.710 --> 37:33.972
We never talked.

37:34.010 --> 37:34.840
We talked.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.848
About work.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.949
About politics.

37:37.980 --> 37:40.949
My mother died, and...

37:40.990 --> 37:42.617
This was a mistake.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.356
Don't you dare say I
wasn't there for you.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.687
I was there for you.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.493
You were not!
You flew out.

37:48.530 --> 37:50.350
I had to fly out.
You said it was fine.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.868
Because what could I say?
That it wasn't fine.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.993
But you were supposed
to know that it wasn't fine.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.635
How?
Oh, God, it's like
we never left each other.

37:58.670 --> 38:02.037
You know... thanks.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.036
I just thought

38:04.080 --> 38:06.401
I had done two years
of my life well,

38:06.450 --> 38:09.044
that's all.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.877
2006...

38:10.920 --> 38:12.911
and seven.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.787
You did do it well.

38:20.830 --> 38:22.821
Sometimes it's too late.

38:24.430 --> 38:27.797
(door closes)

38:27.830 --> 38:30.936
* One, two, three, four...

38:34.940 --> 38:36.908
WILL:
How is she?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.999
Not what I expected.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.075
Is that good?
It is.

38:41.110 --> 38:45.080
So... I met your son earlier.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.747
I know. He said.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.348
I was lame.

38:48.390 --> 38:49.584
I was babbling.

38:49.620 --> 38:50.882
He didn't say that.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.559
I was.

38:53.590 --> 38:57.026
So... do you want
me to meet them?

38:57.060 --> 38:59.028
What?

38:59.070 --> 39:00.469
No.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.092
I mean, formally.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.028
I know. No.

39:04.070 --> 39:06.004
You sure?

39:06.040 --> 39:08.031
Because I could probably make
a good impression.

39:08.070 --> 39:10.038
That's okay.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.048
Thanks.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.844
I mean, really thanks, Will.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.882
But it's not necessary.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.785
Okay. Good.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.051
Good. Good.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.050
* Dog's got a bone

39:30.100 --> 39:33.797
* All on his own

39:33.830 --> 39:35.934
* Wednesday morning...

39:35.970 --> 39:38.507
Mr. Gardner?

39:38.540 --> 39:40.531
Excuse me.

39:40.570 --> 39:42.936
I'm really sorry
about earlier.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.174
For...?

39:44.210 --> 39:46.178
Nothing.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.098
I'm just figuring things
out here.

39:48.150 --> 39:49.617
Good.

39:49.650 --> 39:51.584
But why are you sorry?

39:51.620 --> 39:53.941
I just didn't mean
to come to you first.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.857
Alicia said ifI had
any questions to come to her

39:56.890 --> 39:58.778
and not to bother the partners.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.821
No, you're not bothering us.
Don't worry about it.

40:00.860 --> 40:01.997
Are you sure?
I'm positive.

40:02.030 --> 40:04.123
Okay.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.128
Thank you.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.468
Everybody's so nice here.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.536
Yeah. Lavwers.

40:10.570 --> 40:13.038
The nicest people
in the world.

40:13.070 --> 40:19.179
* Listen you will see,
coming on in to me *

40:19.210 --> 40:22.919
* Listen you will see

40:22.950 --> 40:25.441
* Coming on in to me...

40:25.490 --> 40:27.583
Oh, come on.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.451
Hey!

40:29.490 --> 40:31.458
One minute.

40:31.490 --> 40:33.958
Where are you putting me
now, the parking garage?

40:33.990 --> 40:35.855
Excuse me?
I_won the
Taiwan case.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.925
The one that
you sloughed off on me.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.190
We got Chen at the airport,
trying to flee.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.061
He's going away
for life.
I'm not movmg you.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.091
Peter's moving you.

40:47.170 --> 40:49.206
Peter? Where?

40:57.280 --> 40:59.646
There?

41:06.090 --> 41:07.887
I guess you kiss
enough butts,

41:07.930 --> 41:09.955
you eventually
kiss the right one.
