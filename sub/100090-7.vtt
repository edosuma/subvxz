WEBVTT

00:22.544 --> 00:24.067
- Why do you do that?
- What?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.329
- The never leaving
things out thing?

00:25.373 --> 00:26.896
We've lived together
for a month,

00:26.939 --> 00:29.072
and you've never once left
anything out in the apartment

00:29.116 --> 00:30.856
- Are you kidding me?
Do you not see us?

00:30.900 --> 00:33.033
- Come and search me, po-po.
- Is that an undercover thing?

00:33.076 --> 00:35.035
- Nah, I learned it
before that.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.558
It's a 32 foster homes thing.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.081
You want to survive,
you keep it tight.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.474
Play by the rules.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.128
- Yo, look who it is!
Nina!

00:41.171 --> 00:44.348
What up, rat?
- What's up, Bryce?

00:44.392 --> 00:46.176
How many times you think
we're gonna have to explain

00:46.220 --> 00:48.526
the difference between
undercover officer and snitch?

00:48.570 --> 00:50.572
- Thanks.
- No, thanks, I'm good.

00:50.615 --> 00:51.703
- Sorry.
Habit.

00:51.747 --> 00:54.054
- Sure,
that's one name for it.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.794
- What do we got?

00:55.838 --> 00:57.231
- Turf dispute.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.841
Corner boy was dealing
south end of the courts.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.451
It sounds like he ran into
another corner boy,

01:00.495 --> 01:01.974
this one dealing unsanctioned.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.020
Witnesses say they heard
yelling and then gunshots.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.978
- He's young.
- Seventeen.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.590
Multiple GSWs.
Torso, shin, back.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.201
Wild, sporadic shots--
he was running.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.681
ID puts him living out
in Maywood,

01:12.724 --> 01:14.857
so he was dealing
a long way from home.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.206
- Anything on the shooter?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.729
- Yeah, he's over here.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.079
Kids shot each other.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.384
Guns were still warm

01:20.428 --> 01:22.082
when paramedics and patrol
rolled up.

01:29.176 --> 01:32.570
- These boys were fighting to
survive for the same territory.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.747
Both pulled out their guns,
both dead at 17.

01:35.791 --> 01:38.054
- No doubt Homicide's gonna
rule this mutual combatants.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.577
Why'd they call us?

01:39.621 --> 01:40.926
- I don't know.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.145
We're guessing it's got to do

01:42.189 --> 01:44.016
with whatever the hell's
going on over there.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.280
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.151
- We've got a bit
of a situation.

01:48.195 --> 01:51.241
Unsanctioned corner boy who
was shot wasn't dealing dope.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.591
He was dealing carfentanil.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.202
- It's confirmed?

01:55.245 --> 01:59.031
- Stamps on the drugs match
bags ISP identified last week.

01:59.075 --> 02:02.122
Strain about 100 times
stronger than fentanyl.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.427
Pinhead of this stuff
will kill you,

02:03.471 --> 02:05.168
and whoever's dealing it--

02:05.212 --> 02:06.300
they're cutting it
with soap,

02:06.343 --> 02:07.692
they're cutting it
with cat litter.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.173
So I guess they know
what they're doing.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.740
- He's still lying?
He's there?

02:11.783 --> 02:14.264
- All right, Intelligence
can back Narcotics.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.223
- No, no.
I want you running this.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.312
Narcotics has had it
for a week, and all we got

02:18.355 --> 02:20.792
are these two 17-year-old
corner boys now dead.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.621
- Long-term drug investigations
from dead bottom take time.

02:23.665 --> 02:27.451
- This batch has four ODs.
We're fresh out of time.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.061
If carfentanil
truly hits Chicago,

02:29.105 --> 02:31.368
we're gonna be stacking
dead bodies in freezer trucks

02:31.412 --> 02:33.501
outside the morgue.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.156
- You want me to try and jump
a few rungs on the ladder?

02:36.199 --> 02:38.158
- I sure as hell hope you can.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.943
It's his neighborhood.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.988
Get it done.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.523
- Work hard, okay?

03:04.793 --> 03:08.405
- That is a long drive
from home for ballet class.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.062
I know how to do heat runs,
Darius.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.585
No one followed me.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.240
You're a cooperating defendant.
You're no good to me dead.

03:20.809 --> 03:23.377
Oh, I assume you remember
the deal we made.

03:27.337 --> 03:30.862
It's time to start working
for the police.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.561
Look, the way this works,

03:33.604 --> 03:37.347
I come to you with a case
and you help.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.349
Help goes in your file,

03:39.393 --> 03:42.918
keeps you out of jail
until the next time I show up.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.050
- You don't have to work
so hard to be polite.

03:45.094 --> 03:47.357
I get it.
I'm a snitch.

03:47.401 --> 03:50.969
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.711
I need the name of whoever's
running carfentanil

03:53.755 --> 03:55.365
unsanctioned
in your neighborhood.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.240
- Don't know it.
- Hmm.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.154
That's the wrong answer.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.678
You see, if you don't know it,

04:03.721 --> 04:06.768
I just keep coming back until
you find it, you understand?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.552
Darius.

04:08.596 --> 04:12.164
I'm making this first one
real easy.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.557
It's one thing to deal dope,

04:13.601 --> 04:16.734
a whole other
dealing carfentanil.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.823
You and I both know there's
no way you want that crap

04:18.867 --> 04:21.739
on the streets
of your neighborhood.

04:21.783 --> 04:25.090
So just give me a name
and I'm gone.

04:30.705 --> 04:35.231
Idiot kid's testing
his new product at the courts.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.190
Name's Book Barr.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.236
- See how easy that is?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.759
Thank you.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.895
- So the tip Darius gave us
checks out.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.593
Book Barr, 26,
with a long-ass rap sheet.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.160
He's got two pops
for possession,

04:51.203 --> 04:53.902
one with intent to distribute,
and a domestic on the side.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.904
- Narcotics has him listed
as a current frequent

04:55.947 --> 04:57.340
to Washington Courts,

04:57.384 --> 04:59.473
and he has a hook into
our unsanctioned corner boy.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.778
They grew up together
in Maywood.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.214
This is our guy.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.825
- Do we have a last known?
- No.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.262
And no registered cell phone,
no social media, keeps low.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.611
- Other than
our dead corner boy,

05:07.655 --> 05:09.700
this guy's got a big zero
in associates.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.920
Everybody he's been booked
with is long dead.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.401
CHRIS system's got him linked
to three separate gangs,

05:14.444 --> 05:16.490
AKA they couldn't pin
who he was working with.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.230
- All right, so he must go
where the weight is.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.362
Sounds like he's independent.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.798
He's cutting
and supplying it himself.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.191
- If he doesn't have any boys,

05:22.234 --> 05:24.280
then there's not gonna be
anybody for us to work.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.542
- Well, then we make
an access point,

05:25.586 --> 05:27.501
but we gotta take this guy
quick and easy.

05:27.544 --> 05:30.112
I think our best bet
is we set up a buy from him.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.505
Anybody?

05:31.548 --> 05:33.463
- I may have someone
that can set up an intro.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.117
Old CI of mine out of Maywood.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.119
I popped him when he was 18
on a burglary, flipped him,

05:37.162 --> 05:39.034
then he fell in love
with working for the police.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.035
Never stopped.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.341
- He's like
a professional CI now?

05:41.384 --> 05:42.820
- Yeah, he makes
a living shaking tips.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.039
CPD, DEA, FBI.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.084
You name letters,
he's sold to 'em.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.608
- So what's the hesitation?

05:47.651 --> 05:49.392
- If you ask me, he loves
the chase more than we do,

05:49.436 --> 05:51.351
and it's not always worth
the trouble.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.570
- Well, we need an in,
but he's your CI,

05:53.614 --> 05:55.572
so it's your call.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.487
Can you handle him?

05:57.531 --> 05:59.184
- Yeah, I can handle him.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.838
- Okay, let's go.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.318
- Let's go.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.842
- Cam.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.714
I'll be damned, be damned.

06:06.757 --> 06:10.326
Hailey Ann Upton, light
of my sorry ass little life.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.110
I knew you couldn't
stay away from me.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.503
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.852
You're just playing hard
to get.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.550
- It's not because I thought
you lost your mind?

06:16.593 --> 06:18.726
- Nah, my mind still visits
from time to time.

06:18.769 --> 06:21.076
We got one of them
timeshare things going.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.686
So what's up?
We scraping together or what?

06:22.730 --> 06:23.905
- Maybe.
- What you need?

06:23.948 --> 06:26.386
- An intro to a dealer,
Book Barr.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.431
- Done.
- Really?

06:28.475 --> 06:30.259
- Hell yeah.
Book Barr?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.739
I use him like butter.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.132
He a strange bird, though.
Hustles then dips.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.525
Always changing color.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.309
Guy don't like his ties
to last.

06:37.353 --> 06:40.443
I can muscle an intro, but
price tag's gonna be steep.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.227
- Of course it is.
- Value, baby.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.577
I got it, I know it.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.057
You pay me three,
I'm all yours.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.537
- I'll pay you 500 now,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.539
and 1500 when
we make an arrest.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.758
- Plus two for every kilo
we seize.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.412
- CPD's never gonna go
for that.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.152
- Then pay me out your pocket.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.676
What?
I know you.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.591
You go to work, you go home.
What the hell are you buying?

06:57.634 --> 06:59.114
- Ah, cute.
Not gonna happen.

06:59.157 --> 07:01.464
Grand a key.
- 1500.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.161
- 12 and you have to promise
to listen to me.

07:05.294 --> 07:06.643
- Done.

07:06.687 --> 07:07.949
You wanna shake on it?

07:07.992 --> 07:09.429
Or we can have a quickie
to seal it.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.604
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.170
- Come on,
we can have some fun.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.434
- Uh-huh.

07:21.745 --> 07:24.052
- What is this you're wearing?

07:24.095 --> 07:26.402
- It's my going-out outfit.
- Yeah?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.838
When is the last time
you went out?

07:27.882 --> 07:29.840
- You--oh.

07:29.884 --> 07:33.017
- Man, I missed you!
- And I did miss you.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.629
Not too many people in my life
who know me anymore.

07:35.672 --> 07:36.760
You play close to everyone

07:36.804 --> 07:38.458
means you're not really close
to no one.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.592
My new discovery.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.289
Best place to do
a meet and greet

07:44.333 --> 07:47.118
is surrounded by people so
damned diced out of they minds,

07:47.162 --> 07:48.468
they can't think straight.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.775
- Guy sounds like a cop.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.212
- Thin line between
a pro CI and undercover.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.044
I got eyes on Book.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.962
- Copy, see it.
Haley, you guys are up.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.530
- Yo, Book!

08:10.359 --> 08:12.622
Book, been a minute, man.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.145
How you doing?

08:14.189 --> 08:16.147
- Why the hell you got me
meeting you here?

08:16.191 --> 08:17.627
- Dollar beers!

08:17.671 --> 08:19.847
And I swear, you stand in
one place long enough,

08:19.890 --> 08:21.544
some girl's gonna
come rubbing up to you

08:21.588 --> 08:23.720
telling you how soft
your hair is.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.505
This is my friend I was telling
you about, Hailey.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.723
- Hey.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.464
- I met her up
in Brighton Park.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.031
I tried dealing
her half-assed roxies,

08:30.074 --> 08:31.902
then I realized
I was on her set.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.079
- Cam says
you got something new.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.646
I've been looking
for something new.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.650
- Why's that?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.957
- 'Cause new
usually means cheap.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.654
- Man, you know
I wouldn't bring you no one

08:44.698 --> 08:45.960
who couldn't back it.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.352
She got demand,

08:47.396 --> 08:48.571
and most of her demand
is white

08:48.615 --> 08:50.225
and too stupid
to know street rates.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.053
So we all can't go wrong.

08:52.096 --> 08:55.578
- Yeah, I don't think no pretty
white girl can handle uncut.

08:55.622 --> 08:59.147
- Huh, I'd actually pay more
for uncut.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.545
20% uptick.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.111
- What, you're gonna give
all your money

09:07.155 --> 09:08.678
to a guy you don't know?

09:08.722 --> 09:12.073
- Look, I already tried your
stuff from Washington Courts,

09:12.116 --> 09:13.770
and I know Cam.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.119
He says you're good,
you're good.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.730
And I'm pretty sure
he's already told you

09:16.773 --> 09:19.733
that I'm good,
so it's on you.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.261
Yeah, all right.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.003
I could use you.

09:29.046 --> 09:32.006
Let me get a drink,
then we can talk.

09:44.105 --> 09:47.151
- Why's it dealers
can't keep a clock?

09:47.195 --> 09:50.938
- Let's take this extra time to
go over everything, shall we?

09:50.981 --> 09:54.942
Drugs and cash exchange hands,
what do you do?

09:54.985 --> 09:57.858
- I let your cop buddies crash
and beat me up real good,

09:57.901 --> 10:00.600
and I don't swing back
too much.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.689
- Mm-hmm.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.179
- Yo, you see them numbers
on your phone?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.616
They a clock.

10:16.659 --> 10:17.791
- Yeah.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.706
We got a bit
of a change in plans.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.884
I want you to meet
my boy first.

10:23.927 --> 10:27.496
If we cool, then we deal.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.585
- What boy?
- Don't matter.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.891
Guy I'm working with,
all right?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.110
- The hell is this?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.286
- He talking about his source?
- I don't know.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.288
I guess nobody's truly
independent anymore.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.812
- I thought we were doing
this today.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.378
- We are.
We can go right now.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.513
Why?
Is there a problem?

10:44.556 --> 10:45.688
- Nah, it's cool.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.776
Just don't love
being surprised.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.343
- No, it is a problem.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.432
I already talked price with you
and I'm not gonna debate it.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.652
- No, I'm not gonna change
the price, all right?

10:52.695 --> 10:54.479
I'm just...

10:54.523 --> 10:55.785
I just want you to meet him.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.529
- Is everybody hearing this?

11:00.572 --> 11:02.749
- Yeah.
We're good on GPS.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.447
We're up on Hailey
and Cameron's COH and phones.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.798
So if she wants to go mobile,
then we're good to go.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.452
- Listen, I'm headed there now.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.497
So you either in or you out.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.372
- Fine.
In.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.940
- Hey, back up.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.855
Get in the front.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.599
- All right, we're moving.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.818
We're gonna take
the follow spot.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.385
You guys run parallel,
stay wide,

11:30.428 --> 11:32.692
don't lose the eye.
- Copy that.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.437
- Where are we meeting him at?

11:39.481 --> 11:40.917
You guys set a meet spot?

11:40.961 --> 11:42.658
- It ain't far.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.879
- Okay.

11:52.537 --> 11:55.976
- Okay, we got Book
turning north on Parnell.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.413
- Copy, we'll follow him
on South Normal.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.079
- All right, looks like Book
is trailing a blue Civic.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.776
We got to hang wide.
Kev, you up?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.778
- Yes, sir.
Over and again now.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.824
Two blocks over,
about to hit Lowe street.

12:31.315 --> 12:33.100
- Is this the guy
we're meeting?

12:33.143 --> 12:34.623
- You armed?

12:34.666 --> 12:36.494
- Why the hell would
I need to be?

12:36.538 --> 12:37.887
- Yo, Book, what's going on?

12:41.891 --> 12:44.198
- Oh, we're not meeting anyone.
You're ripping.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.852
- Whoa, whoa!
- Book!

12:52.423 --> 12:54.425
- Hailey, down!

12:58.212 --> 13:00.344
- Hurry, get down!
Stay down!

13:09.136 --> 13:11.921
- Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

13:11.965 --> 13:14.532
- Chicago PD!
Drop your weapon!

13:14.576 --> 13:16.883
Book, put the weapon down now!

13:21.844 --> 13:23.193
Back up!

13:23.237 --> 13:25.761
- Hailey?
- Hailey, you good?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.197
- Stay back!
Stay back!

13:27.241 --> 13:29.199
There's carfentanil all
over the street, it's uncut.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.810
He's overdosing.
I need Narcan and gloves.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.246
- Yeah, glove box.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.813
5021 George.
Emergency.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.554
We need hazmat, Fire, and an
ambulance to 65th and Parnell.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.469
We got one OD victim,
possibly more.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.123
We got uncut carfentanil
on the street.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.256
Have patrol setup
a one-block perimeter...

13:42.299 --> 13:43.866
- No, no, no!
You're staying here.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.650
- It's too late.
We in it.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.137
- Here, take these.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.531
- Come on, let's do it.
Let's do it.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.275
- Come on.
Come on.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.847
It's not working.
Give me another one.

14:07.890 --> 14:08.978
- Come on, man.
Stay in it.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.066
Stay in it.
Come on, brother.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.068
- Stay in it.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.765
Come on.
Come on.

14:13.809 --> 14:14.897
Don't go.
Come on.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.681
Stay in it, stay in it,
stay in it.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.701
- All right, levels are good.
You guys were lucky.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.442
If you feel any worse symptoms

14:38.486 --> 14:39.879
like dizziness
or shortness of breath,

14:39.922 --> 14:41.532
then take another dose
and get to a hospital

14:41.576 --> 14:43.970
just in case.
Understood?

14:46.798 --> 14:48.496
- You good?
- Good.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.628
You?
- Yeah.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.282
Thanks for having my back.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.631
- I got you.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.503
Front, center, sideways.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.722
So what's our next play?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.811
- I don't know.
- I do.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.466
You go press the driver,
I'll go back.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.815
I'll flip some cats,

15:03.859 --> 15:05.426
ID whoever the hell
Book was ripping.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.906
Damn idiot had to know them.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.952
- No, it's not your call
and it's not mine either.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.301
- Yo, that wasn't on us.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.956
That thing flipped,
was chopped from the jump.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.698
- Yeah, well, I gotta go
get my ass handed to me.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.308
A tact officer's
gonna drive you home, okay?

15:18.352 --> 15:19.919
- Whoa, whoa.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.051
At least rap with me about
what our next move's gonna be.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.010
- I can't, Cam.
You're a CI.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.446
You can't be here.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.752
You need to go now,
all right?

15:27.796 --> 15:29.711
See you later.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.107
- It looks like Book
was a one-man robbery crew,

15:34.150 --> 15:35.935
ripping the supply of someone
he was working for.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.849
- The driver of the Civic
was driving scared.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.503
There was no way
this was Book's first rip.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.244
My guess is he was told
to look out

15:41.288 --> 15:42.680
for a black male tailing him.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.508
- That's why he wanted
a white girl in the front seat.

15:44.552 --> 15:45.814
- Gets him close enough
to do the rip,

15:45.857 --> 15:48.338
then he kills Upton, her CI,
takes their cash,

15:48.382 --> 15:49.818
doubles his score,

15:49.861 --> 15:51.385
makes it look like
they did the rip.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.908
No ties.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.692
- Well, at least someone
was being smart.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.651
- We got 600 grams of
uncut carfentanil

15:56.694 --> 15:58.261
and the driver in custody.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.611
- And another body
and another street shut down.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.396
- We got Book for you.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.006
Just turned out
he was a small fish.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.181
We'll get the big one.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.922
We'll keep jumping the ladder.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.707
It may not be pretty,
but it'll be worth it.

16:09.751 --> 16:13.494
- That is what you told me.
- Uh-huh.

16:13.537 --> 16:16.410
- All right.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.631
- Driver of the Civic's
terrified.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.721
Gave up his boss
as soon as we sat down.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.724
This is Mackie Carter, 30.
The guy's a heavyweight.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.030
- Heavy enough to have
six whole blocks.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.553
He runs a section
of the G Park Lords,

16:29.597 --> 16:30.902
deals dope, rocks, and loud.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.687
And until now,
the driver said

16:32.730 --> 16:34.297
that Book was
Mackie's enforcer.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.864
He actually knew the routes.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.953
- So Book steals uncut product
from his boss,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.260
then cuts it himself and sells
it in Washington Courts.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.870
Causes 4 ODs.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.612
- Yeah, but the problem is
Mackie is as organized as hell.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.527
He's got an actual network
to move that carfentanil

16:46.570 --> 16:48.355
smooth and fast as he cuts it.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.183
- All right,
so let's get ahead of him.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.576
Driver of the carfentanil,
he got an in with Mackie?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.622
- Nah, kid's a nobody.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.450
He just picks up cars,
drops off cars.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.886
No contact with the boss.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.584
- Boss,
we might have a problem here.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.064
I ran Mackie through Narcotics;

17:02.108 --> 17:04.110
they've got the G Parks up
on a title three.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.937
They don't got much
from Mackie on the wire,

17:05.981 --> 17:08.070
but they were able to get
a half-dozen covert cams

17:08.114 --> 17:10.029
on his corners.

17:13.162 --> 17:16.426
- When's this from?
- Two days ago.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.993
- All right, get up on Mackie.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.561
I want you to flood his turf
with undercover buys.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.128
Any of that carfentanil drops,

17:22.171 --> 17:25.000
we clear every single corner
he's got.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.872
Send me that footage.
- Got it.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.148
- Man, who do you think I am?

17:42.191 --> 17:44.498
- What's wrong with you?

17:44.541 --> 17:45.716
- You think I'm
one of your boys,

17:45.760 --> 17:47.805
you can just
yank me around?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.285
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.461
- No?

17:51.505 --> 17:52.897
You trying to tell me

17:52.941 --> 17:55.465
you don't know where
Book was getting his drugs?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.122
Hmm?

18:00.166 --> 18:03.691
- The way I remember it,
you asked me a direct question

18:03.734 --> 18:05.388
and I gave you
a direct answer.

18:05.432 --> 18:08.130
It's not my job to trace
where he's getting his product,

18:08.174 --> 18:09.436
that's yours.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.484
- You don't want to play
with me, Darius.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.313
You understand?

18:17.357 --> 18:20.708
'Cause I don't play.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.540
Turn around.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.150
Turn around.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.196
Give me your hands.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.328
You're under arrest.

18:50.781 --> 18:53.175
- I left out Mackie
because we do business.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.352
Lease our border corners
when product's low.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.444
Made sense to give you Book;
he was a problem.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.621
Made no business sense
to give you Mackie.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.972
Not when I can
handle him myself.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.627
- Okay.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.021
Well, that all may
or may not be true...

19:14.240 --> 19:16.981
But we're here now.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.722
I need Mackie.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.942
You've got to give him to me.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.465
- No.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.120
- Darius,

19:25.164 --> 19:27.209
I'm not asking.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.476
- I do that, I'm dead.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.220
Let me worry about that.

19:38.264 --> 19:42.050
I'll find a way to make sure
we all stay upright.

19:42.093 --> 19:44.008
That's my job.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.600
You know...

20:19.261 --> 20:21.350
At some point, you and I,
we're gonna have to start

20:21.394 --> 20:22.873
trusting each other
a little bit.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.879
Or there's nothing in this
for either of us.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.627
- This is a pinhole camera.
It's your COH.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.368
It means we'll have eyes
and ears on you at all times

20:39.412 --> 20:40.848
even when you can't see us.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.371
- Which is gonna be most of it.

20:42.415 --> 20:45.069
Voight wants to play this safe,
so no ghost inside

20:45.113 --> 20:46.723
and no surveillance
for a two-block radius.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.247
- Okay.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.118
Where are the cops
who worked my case?

20:50.161 --> 20:53.208
Uh, Nina or Vanessa
and Kevin?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.602
- Working.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.692
It's a tactic.
You're a new CI.

20:58.735 --> 21:02.565
Voight wants to keep things
calm so you're not...

21:02.609 --> 21:04.785
distracted.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.134
- Um, all right.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.267
She's gonna get
the video feed up and running,

21:08.310 --> 21:09.746
and I'm gonna check
your levels, all right?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.922
So let me just speak
at normal volume...

21:11.966 --> 21:14.055
- What are you doing?

21:18.842 --> 21:21.454
What the hell are you doing?
- I've been hitting the courts,

21:21.497 --> 21:22.977
couple of crash pads out there.
- What?

21:23.020 --> 21:25.414
- It's sounding like Book
was gunning for a regent there.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.547
Prick's name is Mackie.
- Cam, have you lost your mind?

21:27.590 --> 21:30.027
- I can get an intro.
- Stop, stop!

21:30.071 --> 21:31.551
The first rule of being a CI

21:31.594 --> 21:33.117
is to not walk into
a damn police station.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.118
- Whoa, hey, relax.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.598
- You were just seen.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.731
Jesus, I don't even know
how you got inside.

21:37.774 --> 21:40.168
- No, you don't got
to do me like that.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.691
Don't treat me like
you gotta keep me in line.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.650
I ain't working off a case.
I know what I'm doing.

21:43.693 --> 21:44.999
I know people here.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.740
I made it look like I just
got popped from holding.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.350
- Cam, you might have
just burned yourself.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.613
- I didn't--
- I can't use you.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.443
- Are you kidding?
- I don't have a choice.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.445
You have to leave town
and lay low for a while.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.360
- Look, I'm not burned.
- It's done.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.406
- You can't just decide that.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.278
It's my job.
It's what I got.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.802
If I'm not reliable,
I don't get jobs no more.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.630
You can't pull me
before we're paid out.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.284
- Yes, I can.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.460
It's my job to pull you.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.244
I'll pay you for the drugs
we seized,

22:13.288 --> 22:15.029
but then you have
to leave town.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.247
We're done.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.392
We're up.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.440
- Sarge,
Darius has some company here.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.659
Male, black, 30s,
unidentified.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.401
- It's got to be
Darius' enforcer, security.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.794
- You want us to run
an intercept?

22:40.837 --> 22:42.056
Kev's, like,
three blocks down.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.188
He can do a drive by.
- No, let it play.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.150
- We need to talk.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.983
- All right, let's go talk.

22:56.026 --> 22:59.029
- No, no, no.
We could talk right here.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.423
Your new product is still
in my neighborhood.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.557
Washington Courts, four ODs.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.515
- I ain't be dealing that.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.518
It's your product.

23:09.562 --> 23:12.434
You let your product
get ripped.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.916
You let that product run
into my neighborhood.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.134
You getting it, Mackie?

23:17.178 --> 23:20.790
Your product, your problem.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.575
- Yeah, we already on it,
homie.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.577
- Oh, no, homie.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.100
See, the solution is gonna be

23:26.143 --> 23:29.930
that I buy the rest
of your carfentanil supply.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.454
- The hell you are.

23:34.630 --> 23:35.805
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.068
- What the hell?
- Are we moving, Sarge?

23:38.112 --> 23:40.244
- We're trusting Darius.
Hold.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.246
- You sure you wanna do that?

24:02.789 --> 24:05.748
- Do you know why
you have corners, Mackie?

24:08.055 --> 24:10.927
Because I let you.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.886
I gave them.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.453
I will take them.

24:16.585 --> 24:20.850
So the rest
of your carfentanil.

24:20.894 --> 24:23.200
I'm gonna give you
a good price.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.811
You won't lose money.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.294
You guys free tomorrow?

24:30.338 --> 24:33.123
Hmm?

24:33.167 --> 24:35.517
You guys?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.868
Mackie?

24:40.391 --> 24:42.481
- Yeah.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.744
Noon, lot off 73rd.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.267
- My man.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.797
- We're in.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.625
- This guy might have
more power than we thought.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.584
"Because I let you"?
He sounded like Voight.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.676
- You've got to be kidding me.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.852
- I thought you kicked him.
- I did.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.382
- I know, I know.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.514
Relax, you're gonna be happy.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.863
- I wasn't playing
with you, man.

25:16.906 --> 25:19.343
- I got something good, girl.
Something real good.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.041
Your new CI Darius--

25:25.741 --> 25:27.526
5021 Henry, 10-1, 10-1.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.788
Shots fired at the police.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.311
I got a civilian down--

25:30.354 --> 25:32.661
I'm pinned at 1310 West Racine.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.142
I'm a plainclothes officer.
I need backup.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.839
- Units in 21
and units on the citywide,

25:36.883 --> 25:38.580
we have a 10-1 being called.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.016
1310 Racine.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.801
Plainclothes officer
taking fire.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.107
Everyone stay off the air
and start heading that way.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.546
- 5021 Henry, shots are coming
from the upper levels.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.069
I believe it's one shooter.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.679
How far out is my backup?

25:50.723 --> 25:52.594
- Rolling your way.
A minute out.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.030
- Copy that.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.336
I'm going around back
of the building, going dark.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.033
- Copy.

26:14.442 --> 26:17.445
I'm the police!
Gun!

26:17.488 --> 26:19.360
- You good?
You cleared the building?

26:19.403 --> 26:21.928
- No, you clear it.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.887
Back up.
Hey, back up!

26:24.931 --> 26:25.714
Get back!

26:25.758 --> 26:26.933
- Back up.
Back up.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.064
Back up, guys.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.436
- Hey.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.787
- Hey.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.005
Patrol transported
the shooter in?

26:56.049 --> 26:57.224
- Yeah, I just logged him in.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.617
He's in Intelligence.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.184
Voight and Halstead
are having a run at him.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.012
Uh, his name is AJ Flores.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.971
Multiple priors,
affiliated with--

27:05.014 --> 27:07.538
hey, Hailey.
Hailey?

27:07.582 --> 27:08.888
Take a second.

27:08.931 --> 27:11.064
- To what?
Calm down?

27:12.021 --> 27:13.240
- To read the file.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.676
- I don't need to read
the file.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.982
I know what just happened.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.769
He killed my CI right
in front of me, Trudy.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.859
That's what just happened.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.212
- Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die.

27:29.256 --> 27:30.692
So I followed him
and then I shot him.

27:30.736 --> 27:33.216
- You can keep saying that.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.349
It's still not gonna be
the news you think it is.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.612
- We already got you on that,
AJ.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.834
- Y'all don't need
any more police.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.183
I shot him.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.533
Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.274
So I followed him
and then I shot him.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.885
- How'd you know
he was a snitch?

27:49.929 --> 27:52.061
How?

27:52.105 --> 27:54.150
Someone told you.
Who?

27:57.545 --> 27:59.590
Was it this guy?

28:07.511 --> 28:09.122
Darius Walker told you
he was a snitch

28:09.165 --> 28:11.080
and he ordered the hit,
didn't he?

28:11.124 --> 28:14.431
- Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die...

28:14.475 --> 28:16.216
- I don't want
your rehearsed garbage.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.696
Did he order the hit?

28:17.739 --> 28:20.133
- Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.657
So I followed him
and then I shot him.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.180
- Okay, I'll give you a deal.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.747
- Cameron was a snitch...
- What do you want?

28:25.791 --> 28:27.488
Come on, we'll put it
in writing right now.

28:27.531 --> 28:28.707
- Hailey.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.057
- So then I followed him
and then I shot him.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.582
I'd like
my public defender now.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.891
I can sign whatever
you want me to sign,

28:38.934 --> 28:40.588
but I said what I'm gonna say.

28:45.462 --> 28:48.248
- The kid's been in lockup
one too many times.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.640
He's not gonna say
more than he wants.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.861
- Then we bring Darius in
and arrest him now.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.428
He saw Cameron.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.604
He knew Cameron
could ID him as a CI

28:56.647 --> 28:58.301
and he had him killed.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.003
All right.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.787
What do we got on him?

29:05.831 --> 29:08.181
- Well, we ran the shooter's
phone against Darius',

29:08.224 --> 29:10.139
and absolutely no contact.

29:10.183 --> 29:13.752
CHRIS system, social media,
jail logs, last knowns.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.318
There's no connection
to Darius at all.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.146
- AJ runs with
the Latin Players,

29:17.190 --> 29:18.974
Darius with
the Southside Hustlers.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.193
I mean, they're worlds apart.

29:20.236 --> 29:21.672
- They could've met in person.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.152
- We had eyes on Darius
all day

29:23.196 --> 29:24.588
except for about an hour
and a half.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.851
- Ballistics?

29:25.894 --> 29:27.591
- It does link up
to two unsolved shootings,

29:27.635 --> 29:29.202
but they're both hooked up
to Latin Players.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.681
No connect to Darius.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.683
- But we do have the shooter
connected to Cameron.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.555
I mean, Cameron's worked him
on a case before.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.818
- Yeah, but did Cameron
ever work Darius?

29:36.862 --> 29:39.168
- No, and if he found out
who Cameron was

29:39.212 --> 29:40.691
after seeing him
in the roll up,

29:40.735 --> 29:42.084
we can't prove it.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.651
- Hailey,

29:43.694 --> 29:46.567
chances are this shooting's
got nothing to do with Darius.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.526
- All this proves is
that Darius is smart.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.528
Cameron figured out
who Darius was in three hours.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.182
There's no way that Darius
didn't figure out

29:53.226 --> 29:55.489
who Cameron was
in less than that.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.100
We need to bring Darius in,
we hold him for 48,

29:58.144 --> 29:59.275
and we press him.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.842
- We have this buy set
with Darius.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.888
- Who the hell cares?

30:02.931 --> 30:04.150
We're still gonna use him

30:04.193 --> 30:05.804
even though he might've
just offed a CI?

30:09.242 --> 30:11.766
We're still gonna use him?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.812
- Cameron was a pro CI.

30:13.855 --> 30:16.162
He worked hundreds of cases.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.251
This might not have been
the one that caught him.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.863
- Sarge, if we use him,
we might be losing evidence.

30:21.907 --> 30:25.301
- If we don't use him,
we will lose the carfentanil.

30:25.345 --> 30:28.261
And we've got to go
with what we got now.

30:28.304 --> 30:31.003
We'll deal with the rest
when we're done.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.700
Okay?

30:32.743 --> 30:36.573
Now this buy, it balances
on a razor's edge

30:36.617 --> 30:39.620
'cause we've got to bust Mackie
without burning Darius.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.286
- All right, we've got eyes
on Darius and Mackie

30:53.329 --> 30:56.202
from the north end.

30:57.768 --> 30:58.813
- All right, we're up.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.772
Everyone keeps tight
and keeps back

31:01.816 --> 31:04.340
until you get the word
"go" from me.

31:04.384 --> 31:06.255
Nice and easy here.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.257
We let Darius play this one.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.348
- Right on time.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.320
- It'd be real easy to move on
them both right now.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.496
Burn Darius,
can't use him anymore.

31:29.539 --> 31:31.193
He'd be booked,
do his original time.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.456
- Yeah, for drugs.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.068
- 30 years is 30 years.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.129
- All right,
we got eyes on the drugs.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.826
Half dozen half-keys.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.741
- Copy that.
Nobody move.

31:57.785 --> 32:00.179
We wait for Darius
to make his play.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.007
We wait until "go."

32:02.050 --> 32:05.010
- We're trusting--
we're protecting a killer.

32:05.053 --> 32:08.317
- Hailey,
I'd follow you anywhere.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.712
But I know right now you would
tell me to trust Voight.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.896
- The hell is he doing?
Why is he not moving?

32:25.030 --> 32:27.554
Come on, man.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.873
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.150
What is this?

32:59.760 --> 33:00.891
- What?

33:00.935 --> 33:03.198
Why do you have a tracker
on your car?

33:05.809 --> 33:08.029
Are you...

33:08.073 --> 33:09.726
are you playing me?

33:09.770 --> 33:11.380
Mackie, are you working
with the police?

33:11.424 --> 33:13.121
- What the hell
you talking about, man?

33:13.165 --> 33:15.558
- Why do you have a bug
on your car?

33:15.602 --> 33:17.212
- It--it ain't bugged.
Man, I didn't--

33:17.256 --> 33:18.561
- It is.

33:18.605 --> 33:21.477
There's a tracker on your car.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.914
There's a wire on you.
- I ain't no snitch, man!

33:23.958 --> 33:25.612
- Well, if you're not,
they're working you.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.309
- That's not possible, dawg!

33:27.353 --> 33:28.658
- Hey, if they got
your car bugged,

33:28.702 --> 33:30.399
it means they got you bugged.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.793
Mackie,
we're about to get jammed.

33:32.836 --> 33:33.881
So move.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.274
- But there's nobody here
though, man.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.971
- Mackie, get in your car
and move!

33:46.111 --> 33:47.242
- Chicago PD!

33:47.286 --> 33:48.591
- Chicago PD!
Don't move!

33:48.635 --> 33:50.767
Stay right where you are.
- Hands up right now!

33:50.811 --> 33:53.596
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!

33:58.166 --> 34:00.081
Put your hands on the car!

34:00.125 --> 34:02.083
- Tell me someone's got eyes
on that second vehicle.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.085
- Negative.
Car's in the wind.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.348
I repeat, we do not have eyes.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.350
Calling it over
to citywide now.

34:14.269 --> 34:17.403
- There was another car there,
Mackie.

34:17.446 --> 34:20.188
Okay, who was it?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.147
- We got all night.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.976
- Who were you selling to?

34:29.284 --> 34:30.981
- By the time you come
stumbling out the joint,

34:31.025 --> 34:32.548
the whole game
will be dried up.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.376
You'll be an old ass man,
Mackie.

34:34.420 --> 34:37.031
- All your corner boys dead
or gunning for somebody else.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.120
- You think the streets are
still gonna have love for you?

34:39.164 --> 34:41.949
- Unless you wanna lower
your sentence; talk to us.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.603
Tell us who
you were selling to.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.039
We can help you out.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.345
- Help.

34:46.388 --> 34:48.521
Help is as easy as
a 99 confidential agreement.

34:48.564 --> 34:49.739
All you got to do is cooperate.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.045
- Ask me one more time.
- Sit down!

34:51.089 --> 34:52.481
- I ain't no bitch-ass snitch,
man!

34:52.525 --> 34:53.830
Hey, I don't work
for the police, man!

34:53.874 --> 34:55.136
- Shut up, man!

34:55.180 --> 34:58.792
- I ain't no bitch-ass snitch!
- Shut up!

34:58.835 --> 35:00.924
- Well, I'd say that's a win.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.578
That guy has no idea
we played him.

35:06.495 --> 35:09.063
Hailey?

35:09.585 --> 35:11.674
Cameron forgot
which way was up.

35:21.510 --> 35:24.339
- Well, I think we are good.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.822
Mackie definitely bought it.
You weren't made.

35:29.518 --> 35:30.954
- Okay.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.349
- We aren't done yet.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.136
I'm gonna ask you
a direct question.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.746
You need to give me
a direct answer.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.492
Did you order the hit
on Cameron Balow?

35:50.844 --> 35:53.107
I'm not an 18-year-old
corner boy

35:53.151 --> 35:56.328
you popped with a dime bag.
- I know.

35:58.243 --> 36:01.028
- We've both been on
the streets a long time.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.422
Maybe different ends,
but street's the same.

36:06.251 --> 36:09.210
We both know that every time
you stand across from a CI,

36:09.254 --> 36:10.603
you lie.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.039
You can't protect them.

36:13.345 --> 36:16.652
Nine times out of ten,
the house wins,

36:16.696 --> 36:20.090
and the person
in my seat is dead.

36:21.918 --> 36:25.357
I know that, you know that.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.361
Cameron damn well knew that.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.302
- Anything new?
- No.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.086
No, we're at the same place
we were.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.218
There's no evidence.

37:00.261 --> 37:04.222
- Sarge, what's your call
on Darius?

37:04.265 --> 37:06.136
- I wanna keep him in play.
He's valuable.

37:08.182 --> 37:11.141
He probably saved us
hundreds of ODs, right?

37:11.185 --> 37:14.014
Look, the rest is simple.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.409
It's one murder we never make.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.761
He may not even be involved.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.980
- There's no way
you believe that.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.296
My office?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.961
Sit down.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.311
- I don't care
if we can't make the case.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.400
You and I both know
he was involved.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.315
You can't trust him.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.838
- I don't.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.798
- There's a thousand things
that we don't know about him.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.147
- I'm sure that's true.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.367
- He should be held
accountable.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.543
- Cameron walked into
a police station.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.588
He knew he could be made.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.242
Then he went directly out
on the streets--

38:08.286 --> 38:09.983
- Look, no, no.
I'm not defending him.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.811
I'm not saying
he was a good guy,

38:11.854 --> 38:13.508
a smart guy,
a right guy.

38:13.552 --> 38:16.337
But he was my guy.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.513
He was my CI.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.211
I put him out there.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.344
He was mine.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.956
- Why don't you tell me
what you want?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.523
I mean, right now.

38:28.567 --> 38:31.352
You want me to yell at you?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.354
Or do you want me
to make you feel better?

38:33.398 --> 38:35.443
Hmm?

38:35.487 --> 38:37.663
- Hailey.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.191
You're a good cop.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.933
So you know I made
the right decision tonight.

38:53.983 --> 38:57.378
He was yours,
and his death is yours.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.211
Listen, never once have
we made a deal with an angel,

39:04.254 --> 39:07.519
someone we can trust.

39:07.562 --> 39:08.955
It's not how CIs work.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.829
I shouldn't have
to explain that to you.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.443
It's a necessary part
of the job.

39:18.486 --> 39:19.966
I mean, it's...

39:23.665 --> 39:27.495
We keep one foot in a world
we don't belong in,

39:27.539 --> 39:32.500
and we ask our CIs
to do the exact same thing.

39:36.591 --> 39:39.159
Only...

39:39.202 --> 39:40.900
you're the cop.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.858
Cameron was a snitch.

39:44.686 --> 39:49.430
So I'm sure his death is

39:49.474 --> 39:52.477
the cost of the game,
but...

39:55.436 --> 39:57.656
You're the one who
has the carry it.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.012
That is on you.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.692
- How do I do that?

40:35.607 --> 40:38.087
How do I carry it?

40:46.356 --> 40:48.968
I still have no idea.
