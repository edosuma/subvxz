00:34.659 --> 00:36.578
Morning, Mom!

00:36.578 --> 00:38.788
- Hey.
- Anuj is here. Bye.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.956
Uh-huh.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.604
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.690
Need a partner?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.152
Hi.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.446
That whole TP thing was pretty cool.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.532
- Thank you.
- How'd you even do that?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.826
<i>Come on! Throw me one.</i>

01:36.846 --> 01:39.099
Dad.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.727
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lose your staff.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.395
I don't want to hear it.

01:45.563 --> 01:50.527
You've put us in more danger than ever.

01:50.527 --> 01:54.614
What were you doing that was so important?

01:54.614 --> 01:57.617
- It was a special task--
- For what?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.662
Soccer thing.

02:04.332 --> 02:08.002
You're grounded for 200 years.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.046
After that,

02:10.046 --> 02:12.632
you'll work at the Imperial Stables,
as I did.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.717
Maybe that'll teach you how to behave.

02:14.717 --> 02:15.885
But I'm not you.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.096
And I never want to be you!

02:18.096 --> 02:22.642
And I never want to be you!

02:25.103 --> 02:26.896
<i>This was not the first time</i>

02:26.896 --> 02:28.398
<i>Sun Wukong had heard these words.</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:31.818
<i>Thousands of years earlier,
long before he was the father of Wei-Chen,</i>

02:31.818 --> 02:35.947
<i>and even before he was a king,
he was just a monkey.</i>

02:35.947 --> 02:38.575
<i>It was then that he first felt
the sting of rejection.</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:43.121
<i>At, of all places,
the Sublime Banquet of Immortal Peaches,</i>

02:43.121 --> 02:46.791
<i>where they were set to name
the next Great Sage.</i>

02:46.791 --> 02:51.462
<i>This is the story of confidence,
friendship, ambition and loss.</i>

02:54.924 --> 02:58.428
<i>♪ Fruit flower power
He is all the rage ♪</i>

02:59.095 --> 03:02.515

03:43.514 --> 03:44.682
You can enter.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.978
Enter.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.231
Hey, doorman! Hurry up!

03:51.231 --> 03:53.191
Please don't get us into trouble.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.984
Don't worry.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.404
I'm not going to embarrass you
at your office party.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.948
This is not an office party.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.742
It's the Sublime Banquet
of Immortal Peaches.

04:02.742 --> 04:06.371
This year, they're
giving the Sacred Peach to Ao Guang.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.538
Who's Ao Guang?

04:08.081 --> 04:11.417
He's Great Sage!

04:11.417 --> 04:14.379
They say he used to be a fish,

04:14.379 --> 04:15.838
but he worked really hard

04:15.838 --> 04:17.924
and eventually became a dragon.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.513
Hey! They're cutting in front of us!

04:23.513 --> 04:26.391
- Those are very important officials.
- I don't care who they are.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.767
They can't just--

04:27.767 --> 04:29.185
Here she comes!

04:31.187 --> 04:32.355
Who?

04:32.939 --> 04:35.525
Guanyin. The Goddess of Compassion.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.193
She looks amazing.

04:38.987 --> 04:39.904
Oh, crap.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.197
She's coming right towards us.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.075
- You should say hi.
- What? Are you kidding me?

04:44.075 --> 04:46.160
Just say hi. Go! Go! Go!

04:46.160 --> 04:48.246
Oh--

04:48.246 --> 04:50.957
Magnificent and beloved Guanyin...

04:50.957 --> 04:52.625
Uh, I...

04:53.251 --> 04:54.377
You...

04:54.377 --> 04:55.378
You're awesome.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.511
Good job mumbling to her.

05:03.511 --> 05:07.181
Heaven's a hierarchy
and she's at the top--

05:07.181 --> 05:08.516
Let me ask you a question.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.143
Do you know who you are?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.394
Uh...

05:11.894 --> 05:14.022
Yeah. I'm Bull Demon.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.649
I have my own place. Not huge, but--

05:16.649 --> 05:20.320
I'm not talking about your crappy cave!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
I'm asking, do you know who you are?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.407
Your goals. Your dreams!

05:24.407 --> 05:27.201
Uh... Well, in the next 2,000 years,

05:27.201 --> 05:29.996
if I work hard...

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
Say it. Say it!

05:31.956 --> 05:34.375
"I want to be the next Great Sage."

05:34.375 --> 05:36.294
No, no. That's not what I said!

05:36.294 --> 05:39.172
You've been here forever.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.257
You deserve a big promotion.

05:43.259 --> 05:48.014
<i>♪ If you look inside ♪</i>

05:48.014 --> 05:50.558
<i>♪ There's a special guy ♪</i>

05:50.558 --> 05:52.977
- Stop it. I hate that song!
- Next.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.146
Okay! We get it!

05:56.439 --> 05:58.983
- Name?
- Hi. Yes.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.152
Bull Demon. And guest.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.697
Okay, you guys are good.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.240
Hold on.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.784
Can't let you in.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.994
You're not wearing shoes.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.497
You can't even see my feet!

06:12.497 --> 06:15.500
I don't need to see them.
I can smell them.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.920
Okay, I get it. You're a joker.
But do you know who I am?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.755
I'm the God of Bare Feet!

06:20.755 --> 06:23.758
You're still a monkey.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.635
Next!

06:25.635 --> 06:29.055
Wukong, don't make a fuss.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.307
No! He can't treat us like that.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.683
We're going in there.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.103
Let's just go!

06:35.103 --> 06:37.897
- Move!
- Magnificent Ji Gong!

06:37.897 --> 06:39.982
I'm so sorry, but you can't bring that in.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.150
What?

06:41.150 --> 06:44.195
I'm so sorry, sir.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.656
- Who's this guy?
- Ji Gong. A high-ranking official.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.449
Probably the next Great Sage.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.785
I'll just finish it here. Eh?

06:50.785 --> 06:51.953
That'd be great!

06:52.537 --> 06:54.163
I have an idea.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.709
What are you doing?

07:00.461 --> 07:02.255
It's still full.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.257
What? No, it's not. I just finished it.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.385
Huh. That's strange.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.431
Oh, well. Bottoms up!

07:14.725 --> 07:17.228
<i>More!</i>

07:17.228 --> 07:18.271
This guy can really drink.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.148
Weird. It feels full again.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.066
Oh, well. Bottoms up!

07:28.281 --> 07:30.741
- Sir? Are you okay?
- Follow me!

07:40.460 --> 07:43.880
Wow. Look at this!

07:43.880 --> 07:47.216
The Gods sure know how to party.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.680
I'm excited to meet everyone.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.267
They should be excited to meet <i>you</i>.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.479
I don't know about that.
I'm not very important.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.689
Hey, that Ji Gong guy...

08:01.689 --> 08:04.400
You said he was
the next Great Sage, right?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.526
Yeah, why?

08:06.152 --> 08:09.489
Well, he got kicked out, right?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.615
Yeah.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.327
Which means...

08:14.327 --> 08:16.454
he doesn't get to
eat the peach?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.998
No! How can you not see it?

08:18.998 --> 08:22.168
It means the position is open!

08:22.168 --> 08:26.714
There are plenty of other Gods up for it.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.803
And Bull Demon!

08:32.803 --> 08:37.099
This is your chance
to show them who you are!

08:37.099 --> 08:40.645
No, no, no.
I'm just happy to be here.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.104
Award Winners Only

08:43.314 --> 08:44.857
Nonsense!

08:46.734 --> 08:51.364
Let's find Ao Guang
and tell him your great ideas.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.199
I don't know...

08:55.368 --> 08:57.787
Listen to me.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.456
I'm going to be honest.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.541
I believe in you.

09:01.541 --> 09:07.213
But it doesn't matter
unless you believe in yourself.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.882
So let's go find this fish cake!

09:11.592 --> 09:12.760
Come.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.725
Welcome to the Sublime Banquet!

09:21.185 --> 09:28.192
The first award of the night
is "Most Feared God"!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.700
You said I could talk this time!

09:35.700 --> 09:36.993
You can. Just not now.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.369
This is my palace!

09:50.214 --> 09:51.882
- Hmm?
- Hello.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.263
Mmm?

09:58.889 --> 10:00.683
Excuse me. Don't I know you?

10:01.183 --> 10:02.351
Aren't you

10:02.351 --> 10:06.063
Beautiful Face
of Incomprehensible Perfection?

10:06.063 --> 10:09.191
No. I'm Princess Jade Face.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.694
Ah. [clicks tongue] Yes, of course!

10:11.694 --> 10:13.821
This is my friend.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.281
Princess Iron Fan.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.449
Nice to meet you.

10:16.449 --> 10:20.328
Any chance you ladies know
where The Dragon King is?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.288
We need to talk to him.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.623
Oh?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.082
- Is that so?
- Yes.

10:26.417 --> 10:30.046
My buddy here is going to be
the next Great Sage.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.465
No, no. He's kidding.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.216
Wow! Cool!

10:34.216 --> 10:37.511
Hey, why don't you tell them
about your idea?

10:37.511 --> 10:39.263
For a journey to the West!

10:39.263 --> 10:41.390
They don't want to hear about that.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.517
I guess you don't want to talk to us.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.602
Okay. Bye.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.437
Wait!

10:47.021 --> 10:50.274
Are you interested in enlightenment?

10:50.274 --> 10:54.236
Hmm. Maybe. Let's find out.

10:54.236 --> 10:59.909
Well, rumor has it, in India,

10:59.909 --> 11:02.662
there are many Sutras.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.290
To unlock them, you need the Iron Staff.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.423
And these Sutras are written on Scrolls?

11:14.423 --> 11:18.594
Yes. But their wisdom
can be infused in anything!

11:18.594 --> 11:24.392
A Scroll, a cloud, a rock. Even a crab.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.352
That's very interesting.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.937
I think so too.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.692
Told you my boy was smart.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.944
So a Sutra...

11:34.944 --> 11:37.530
is a crab?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.075
Thank you to all the Gods who voted!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.785
But like I say every year,

11:42.785 --> 11:46.622
please stop giving me this award.

11:46.622 --> 11:47.832
I'm begging you.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.669
Wait, is that The Dragon King?

11:51.669 --> 11:56.048
You didn't tell me he was so handsome!

11:56.048 --> 11:57.425
It's go time!

11:57.425 --> 11:58.843
Wait, she was just telling me--

11:58.843 --> 12:00.302
No time for that.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.181
Hurry up!

12:06.976 --> 12:08.144
Private area.

12:08.853 --> 12:13.315
Get your head in the game!
That was our chance!

12:13.315 --> 12:16.235
Bull Demon. Maybe I can help.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.581
- Thank you.
- No problem.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.665
Let's go!

12:29.665 --> 12:31.792
Just don't forget who helped you!

12:37.339 --> 12:40.718
Hmm? What is this?

12:44.764 --> 12:45.973
You're so rude!

12:45.973 --> 12:48.768
You should've let her finish.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.854
And you should focus on finding this fish.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.152
<i>Hurry up! I need water right now!</i>

12:58.152 --> 12:59.737
I hear a fish.

13:00.821 --> 13:05.367
<i>Be gentle! It hurts!</i>

13:10.372 --> 13:11.874
Slowly, slowly.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.252
Let me see your nails.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.754
Why so sharp?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.798
I'm starting to think
you do it on purpose.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.175
- I wouldn't dare, Master Ao Guang.
- Ao Guang?

13:21.175 --> 13:24.470
How dare you call me by my name?
In case it's not obvious, I'm a dragon.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.847
Of course. It's very obvious.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.766
We can tell by your breath.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.852
What's that?

13:31.852 --> 13:33.270
Nothing.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.397
"Nothing."

13:41.737 --> 13:43.447
Why am I not being moistened yet?

13:43.948 --> 13:45.616
I'm turning into a wafer over here!

13:45.616 --> 13:47.618
Right away, sir.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.662
Hurry up!

13:51.831 --> 13:53.624
Useless.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.636
What are you doing?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.350
Let's wake him up.
We've got business to take care of.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.353
He's probably tired
from all his important duties.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.108
"Important duties"? Yeah, right.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.276
Look.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.862
Ruyi Jingu Bang

14:26.949 --> 14:28.701
Don't touch that!

14:28.701 --> 14:31.495
You're such a buzzkill.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.831
Well, I'm going to enjoy the party.

14:33.831 --> 14:38.377
Let me know when our fish friend wakes up.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.212
Wait!

14:42.548 --> 14:44.675
Who are you?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.305
Most beneficent Dragon King.
Please forgive me--

14:49.305 --> 14:51.056
Who the hell are you?

14:51.056 --> 14:53.893
I am Bull Demon.
I work in the Offerings Department...

14:53.893 --> 14:56.562
Luli! Bingwen!

14:56.562 --> 14:59.106
- I need to be moistened now!
- Uh--

14:59.106 --> 15:00.441
Great Sage.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.903
I can moisten you if you'd like.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.405
That's a toilet!

15:06.405 --> 15:08.073
You idiot!

15:08.073 --> 15:11.577
- I'm sorry, I didn't know!
- Where the hell have you two been?

15:11.577 --> 15:16.081
- How did you get in here?
- I just wanted a word with Great Sage.

15:16.081 --> 15:20.044
A word? If you have a complaint,
take it up with the Sufferings Department.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.587
It's not a complaint.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.256
I just want to ask The Dragon King

15:24.256 --> 15:26.008
to hear my humble proposal.

15:26.008 --> 15:31.138
Far off in India are several Sutras...

15:31.138 --> 15:33.140
Ah. Nice.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.060
Feels good.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.358
If we commissioned a pilgrimage,
a journey to the West...

15:42.358 --> 15:47.363
Don't forget my back.
And my bottom.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.031
Uh--

15:49.531 --> 15:56.455
Perhaps we could
share these teachings with the world.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.168
Is he snoring?

16:01.835 --> 16:03.504
Yes, I think you put him to sleep.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.465
Congratulations.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.971
I'm more than just a great beard.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.306
I'm also the God of War!

16:14.306 --> 16:18.435
It is a fantastic beard though.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.647
Hey! Geez. What took you so long?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.190
There's my guy!

16:23.190 --> 16:25.985
- How'd it go?
- Not great.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.277
What happened?

16:27.569 --> 16:29.613
They told me I didn't belong here.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.699
They said that?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.033
They're right though.

16:33.033 --> 16:37.329
I don't belong here.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.498
I'll take care of this.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.166
- Follow me!
- Huh?

17:07.192 --> 17:12.823
- Wukong, what are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'll put it back.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.118
Depending on how well it works.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.053
Alright. Get off.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.807
Hello, everybody!

17:38.807 --> 17:42.603
I'd like to say something to my wife.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.900
I never loved you!

17:48.650 --> 17:51.653
I'm in love with your sister.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.241
What?

17:56.241 --> 17:59.453
Thank you all! [laughs] Enjoy the show!

18:00.662 --> 18:02.122
Okay. You're up.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.124
What do you want me to do out there?

18:04.124 --> 18:07.211
What do I want you to do?
What you should've done a long time ago.

18:07.211 --> 18:11.256
I want you to show them who you are.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.759
It's showtime.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.260
What is this?

18:15.260 --> 18:17.387
This is Jingu Bang. The Iron Staff!

18:17.971 --> 18:20.182
You are the next Great Sage.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.392
Go. Go!

18:30.150 --> 18:32.736
How does he have Jingu Bang too?

18:40.494 --> 18:44.331
<i>♪ If you look inside ♪</i>

18:44.998 --> 18:48.418
-<i>♪ There's a special guy ♪</i>
- Who the hell is that?

18:49.169 --> 18:53.298
<i>♪ He's very strong ♪</i>

18:53.298 --> 18:57.302
<i>♪ He's full of good ideas ♪</i>

18:57.302 --> 19:01.932
<i>♪ I'm a shining star ♪</i>

19:02.766 --> 19:05.144
<i>♪ I'm Bull Demon... ♪</i>

19:08.105 --> 19:09.690
Great! Thanks!

19:09.690 --> 19:12.151
Get off.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.027
Who's ready for the big finale?

19:14.027 --> 19:16.155
I know you've all been waiting for it!

19:16.822 --> 19:19.158
The Celestial Achievement Award
of Eternity!

19:20.284 --> 19:23.620
And now, Gods and Goddesses,

19:23.620 --> 19:26.748
Are! You! Ready!

19:27.958 --> 19:29.543
Are you ready?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.295
Let's welcome...

19:31.295 --> 19:33.505
Great Sage, Ao Guang!

19:37.467 --> 19:38.552
Ah.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.387
Hi-yah.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.515
What happened to Jingu Bang?

19:43.515 --> 19:47.144
Thank you, sweetie.
I'll take it from here.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.689
Round of applause for Queen Mother!

19:53.442 --> 19:56.361
Don't worry, handsome.
I'll get to you in a second.

19:58.071 --> 20:01.783
Wonderful party tonight, huh?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.453
I know what you're thinking.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.624
"Why is there a monkey on stage?"

20:09.750 --> 20:13.003
And you're right. I shouldn't be here.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.341
My friend, Bull Demon, brought me.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.552
He was very excited to meet you all.

20:20.552 --> 20:25.474
Personally, I wasn't so sure.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.101
To be honest,

20:28.769 --> 20:30.687
I'm pretty disappointed.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.400
Don't get me wrong.
The party's great.

20:35.400 --> 20:40.739
But it's also a big lie.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.368
Just a bunch of phonies
giving each other awards.

20:44.368 --> 20:48.413
And the biggest award of all?
This beauty right here.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.208
10,000 years of growing,

20:51.208 --> 20:53.502
just to please one nasty old fish.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.507
Oh, come on!

20:58.507 --> 21:00.676
We all know he's a fish.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.887
He doesn't even look like a dragon!

21:05.973 --> 21:08.558
Listen, I like fish.

21:09.059 --> 21:13.522
But this guy is nothing special.

21:14.022 --> 21:20.404
In fact, the truth is none of you are.

21:20.404 --> 21:24.408
That's why you tell people like us
we don't belong.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.619
To make yourselves feel special!

21:27.619 --> 21:31.248
But tonight that ends.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.126
Tonight we tear it all down!

21:47.014 --> 21:49.182
Nice, right?

21:54.104 --> 22:00.694
I've waited 10,000 years for that.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.529
What?

22:02.529 --> 22:04.656
Finally,

22:04.656 --> 22:11.038
someone is speaking the truth.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.581
You're joking, right?

22:13.165 --> 22:16.126
I'm serious.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.879
In fact, to prove how serious I am,

22:18.879 --> 22:22.716
I just might make you the next Great Sage!

22:26.178 --> 22:28.472
Now I know you're joking.

22:29.389 --> 22:32.976
The truth is I hate this place.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.103
And so do you.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.273
Which makes you the perfect person

22:38.982 --> 22:41.735
to succeed me.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.154
What if I don't want the job?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.947
Exactly!

22:45.947 --> 22:48.867
- You see what I'm saying?
- No.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.913
What's your name, Monkey?

22:52.913 --> 22:55.665
Don't call me Monkey. It's Sun Wukong!

22:55.665 --> 22:58.460
Oh, sensitive.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.337
It's okay. It's okay.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.006
Once you're Great Sage,

23:03.006 --> 23:06.176
they'll call you whatever you want!

23:06.176 --> 23:08.470
Introducing Sun Wukong!

23:08.470 --> 23:10.931
Ladies and Gentlemen!

23:10.931 --> 23:13.975
It's my pleasure to present to you

23:13.975 --> 23:16.353
the next Great Sage.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.979
Equal to Heaven!

23:17.979 --> 23:20.732
Great Sage Equal to Heaven!

23:20.732 --> 23:21.775
Sun Wukong!

23:43.255 --> 23:45.590
Quite a night.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.676
Yeah.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.220
Where's your friend?

23:52.305 --> 23:53.432
I lost him.

23:55.976 --> 24:01.815
You should come by Flame Mountain.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.859
I'll show you around.

24:04.651 --> 24:09.656
Maybe I'll do that someday.

24:09.656 --> 24:13.535
- Iron Fan, let's go.
- Oh?

24:13.535 --> 24:16.496
I want noodles.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.708
See you around.

24:24.254 --> 24:28.258
There's my guy. Where have you been?

24:28.258 --> 24:30.844
Waiting for you. For a while.

24:31.636 --> 24:36.016
Can you believe this night?

24:36.016 --> 24:38.143
Not really.

24:39.561 --> 24:45.025
I was unsure at first,
but then I realized,

24:46.026 --> 24:48.487
we did it.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.449
- What are you talking about?
- I got in.

24:53.158 --> 24:58.038
And now that I'm in, I can get you in.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.290
I don't think that's how it works.

25:00.290 --> 25:03.502
Sure, it is! I'm Great Sage.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.378
I can do anything I want.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.215
How do you not get this?

25:10.217 --> 25:14.679
You know,
I wasn't going to bring you tonight.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.433
Because you always embarrass me.

25:19.267 --> 25:25.190
But I brought you anyway.
Because you're my best friend.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.860
I don't embarrass you.

25:29.528 --> 25:33.532
I push you. Because I believe in you.

25:33.532 --> 25:38.036
No, you push me
because you want me to be like you.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.121
Because you're scared.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.457
And I want you to be confident. Like me.

25:44.251 --> 25:48.129
Confident?
You're the most insecure person I know.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.674
Maybe you're just jealous.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.467
Maybe you're just selfish.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.429
If you had listened to me--

25:56.429 --> 25:57.722
I did listen to you!

25:57.722 --> 25:59.099
It didn't work.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.392
And I looked like a fool.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.061
I should've just been myself!

26:03.061 --> 26:04.854
Yourself?

26:05.522 --> 26:07.440
They didn't even want to let us in!

26:07.440 --> 26:09.776
They didn't want to let <i>you</i> in.

26:09.776 --> 26:15.156
Oh, yeah? Then who got us in?
Who got you to Ao Guang?

26:15.156 --> 26:18.368
But you couldn't seal the deal!

26:19.077 --> 26:23.039
They don't give awards to the nice guy.

26:23.039 --> 26:25.625
If you want something, you just take it!

26:25.625 --> 26:26.960
I see that now.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.381
You want to know the truth?

26:31.881 --> 26:36.428
You don't have what it takes
to be Great Sage!

26:55.113 --> 26:57.365
You asked me before

26:58.325 --> 27:01.870
if I know who I am.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.373
Maybe I don't.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.792
But I know who I'm not.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.003
I'm not you.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.213
And I never want to be you!

27:41.910 --> 27:42.952
Wait.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.207
You should go back.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.258
Really? Are you sure?

27:57.258 --> 28:01.221
You have your own path.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.391
And you should follow it.

28:06.226 --> 28:10.397
There's someone
who might be able to help you.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.607
But please, son. Be careful.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.026
Thank you, dad!

28:29.582 --> 28:32.502
Jin! Jin! Hi.

28:34.879 --> 28:35.880
Wei-Chen?

28:36.756 --> 28:39.175
- Where have you been?
- Sorry. My father took me home.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.012
Okay. I-- I was worried about you, dude.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.097
It's okay. I'm okay.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.267
I just only missed one day and I'm back.
I got a new plan.

28:47.267 --> 28:51.062
No. You didn't miss one day,
you've been gone for a month.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.023
- What?
- Jin!

28:54.524 --> 28:56.192
Let's go! Get on the bus.
