00:07.425 --> 00:08.880
Hey, Dez.

00:08.881 --> 00:10.333
Why do you have all your stuff?

00:10.334 --> 00:12.336
I had to move out of my
house for a couple of days,

00:12.337 --> 00:14.753
because one of my Dad's
inventions went haywire.

00:14.754 --> 00:18.467
I only took the stuff
I really need.

00:18.468 --> 00:20.458
You really need a Panini press?

00:20.459 --> 00:23.579
Yes, Ally. Yes, I do.

00:24.631 --> 00:28.239
My family's in a motel, but I'm
gonna crash in the practice room.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.258
I don't mind you staying here, Dez, but it
would have been nice if you'd asked first.

00:32.259 --> 00:36.575
Oh, I asked. My parents
are totally cool with it.

00:36.576 --> 00:39.576
I'm not rude, Ally.

00:40.904 --> 00:42.891
So, what'd your Dad
invent this time?

00:42.892 --> 00:44.783
A robot guard dog.

00:44.784 --> 00:46.718
Unfortunately it's
stuck on attack mode.

00:46.719 --> 00:49.359
Check this out.

00:51.165 --> 00:56.134
We have to wait for its batteries to die
before we can even get back in the house.

00:56.135 --> 00:59.598
Guess who got a job at F.M. 109.

00:59.599 --> 01:02.059
What are you, the
nighttime janitor?

01:02.060 --> 01:05.671
No. I'm hosting the love
song dedication show.

01:05.672 --> 01:10.532
They hired me for my warm,
gentle personality.

01:11.347 --> 01:13.172
That's my favorite show.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.761
All those couples sending love songs
to each other, it's so romantic.

01:16.762 --> 01:19.032
Ooh, bet my sister phones a lot.

01:19.033 --> 01:21.631
She got a new boyfriend, and she
cannot stop talking about him.

01:21.632 --> 01:23.600
Ooh, is he gonna be at
her birthday party?

01:23.601 --> 01:25.735
Yeah, we'll all meet him
for the first time.

01:25.736 --> 01:27.322
She said I can't be a weirdo.

01:27.323 --> 01:31.034
When have I ever been a weirdo?

01:31.035 --> 01:32.575
Marshmallow-salmon Panini?

01:32.576 --> 01:34.934
- Gross!
- Of course!

01:34.935 --> 01:38.581
Anyway... I'm hosting a live
broadcast at the Mall later.

01:38.582 --> 01:41.584
We're having a contest to give
away a pink electric scooter.

01:41.585 --> 01:44.990
Dez, you should enter. You can give
the scooter to Didi for her birthday.

01:44.991 --> 01:49.904
That's perfect! I'll look like I
care without even spending a dime.

01:49.905 --> 01:51.460
So what's the contest?

01:51.461 --> 01:57.113
You have to recite poetry while sticking
your feet in a tub full of cockroaches.

01:57.114 --> 02:00.389
- Ewe, that's awful!
- I know.

02:00.390 --> 02:02.550
Poetry...

02:03.229 --> 02:05.209
Gross.

02:08.567 --> 02:11.669
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:11.670 --> 02:14.804
<i>♪ 'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:14.805 --> 02:16.336
<i>♪ You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:16.337 --> 02:17.955
<i>♪ You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:17.956 --> 02:21.000
<i>♪ And I see our names
together on every billboard.</i>

02:21.001 --> 02:24.059
<i>♪ We're headed for the
top, we've got it on lock.</i>

02:24.060 --> 02:25.673
<i>♪ We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:25.674 --> 02:27.996
<i>♪ And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:27.997 --> 02:32.134
<i>♪ Oh, there's no way I
could make it without ya.</i>

02:32.135 --> 02:35.170
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:35.171 --> 02:38.240
<i>♪ It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:41.563
<i>♪ With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

02:41.564 --> 02:44.213
<i>♪ I own this dream.</i>

02:44.214 --> 02:47.591
<i>♪ 'Cause I got you with me.</i>

02:47.592 --> 02:50.709
<i>♪ There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:50.710 --> 02:55.150
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:01.369 --> 03:03.811
And we're back on F.M. 109.

03:03.812 --> 03:06.340
That last song went out
from Aaron to Amelia.

03:06.341 --> 03:10.021
He says he's gonna keep requesting that
song every day until you call him back.

03:10.022 --> 03:11.933
Please call him back.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.019
I hate that song.

03:14.020 --> 03:17.655
And now time for our contest.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.732
Is there anyone else besides
Dez who's brave enough

03:19.733 --> 03:23.706
to stick their bare feet in
this tub of cockroaches?

03:23.707 --> 03:26.940
No one? Yes! I win the scooter.
Woo!

03:26.941 --> 03:29.761
Not so fast, Red.

03:30.516 --> 03:32.337
What are you doing here, Chuck?

03:32.338 --> 03:34.318
I'm here to win that scooter.

03:34.319 --> 03:38.456
- You mind holding these, little lady?
- Actually, I do mind... okay.

03:38.457 --> 03:40.117
The rules are simple...

03:40.118 --> 03:42.206
Whoever can stand in
this tub of cockroaches

03:42.207 --> 03:45.133
the longest while
reciting poetry wins.

03:45.134 --> 03:46.696
That's gonna be me, Chuck.

03:46.697 --> 03:48.621
I can stand in
cockroaches so long,

03:48.622 --> 03:52.183
birds are gonna think I'm a tree,
and build nests in my hair.

03:52.184 --> 03:53.525
Oh, yeah?

03:53.526 --> 03:57.382
I can stand in cockroaches so long, I'm
gonna grow a beard down to my ankles.

03:57.383 --> 03:59.384
People are gonna call me...

03:59.385 --> 04:02.085
Rip Van Chuckle.

04:02.181 --> 04:02.998
Oh, yeah?

04:02.999 --> 04:06.291
Get in the darn tub
and say some poems!

04:06.292 --> 04:07.731
I love poetry.

04:07.732 --> 04:10.408
I hope they do
Shakespeare sonnets.

04:10.409 --> 04:14.232
<i>- ♪ Twinkle twinkle, little star...
- ♪ Mary had a little lamb...</i>

04:14.233 --> 04:18.527
<i>- ♪ How I wonder what you are...
- ♪ Its fleece was white as snow...</i>

04:18.528 --> 04:20.375
You're doing great, Dez!
Don't think of all the

04:20.375 --> 04:22.597
disgusting roaches crunching
between your toes.

04:22.598 --> 04:24.242
I'll be okay as long
as they don't...

04:24.243 --> 04:25.625
Climb up my leg!

04:25.626 --> 04:29.166
They're climbing up my leg!

04:29.647 --> 04:31.139
I beat you again, Red.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.690
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

04:33.691 --> 04:37.188
Well, I stood in cockroaches
longer than you.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.935
I won the scooter.

04:38.936 --> 04:43.616
That's really the only
way to look at it.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.416
I can't believe I
lost to Chuck again.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.147
Oh, don't feel bad, honey.

04:53.148 --> 04:56.984
Chuck's just better than
you at most things.

04:56.985 --> 04:58.107
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm hmm.

04:58.108 --> 05:01.289
You always know what to say.

05:01.290 --> 05:02.971
Hey, guys, glad you
could make it.

05:02.972 --> 05:05.633
Are you kidding? I love
hanging out with you guys.

05:05.634 --> 05:08.325
- Did you bring any inventions?
- You know it!

05:08.326 --> 05:09.897
What up?!

05:09.898 --> 05:13.402
It's great to see you again, Mr.
and Mrs...

05:13.403 --> 05:17.063
Ally, Trish! You look amazing!

05:17.138 --> 05:18.707
Hey, Didi. Happy Birthday.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.909
I can't wait for you girls
to meet my boyfriend.

05:21.910 --> 05:23.411
Austin, let me ask
you something.

05:23.412 --> 05:25.567
How many times have you been
sitting around the table,

05:25.568 --> 05:27.451
you ask someone to pass
you the potatoes...

05:27.452 --> 05:29.298
It takes forever, right?

05:29.299 --> 05:31.219
- Not really.
- Exactly!

05:31.220 --> 05:34.197
That's why I invented...

05:34.198 --> 05:36.186
The potato-pult!

05:36.187 --> 05:38.665
This will revolutionize the way
the world passes potatoes.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.127
Cool!

05:40.128 --> 05:42.391
I'll grab a plate.

05:42.392 --> 05:44.899
Can someone pass the potatoes?

05:44.900 --> 05:47.720
Coming right down.

05:50.331 --> 05:53.802
Dad, I don't want you using your
gadgets when my boyfriend gets here.

05:53.803 --> 05:56.956
If you embarrass me, my life
will be ruined forever.

05:56.957 --> 06:01.214
Honey, I know you're nervous because we're
meeting your boyfriend for the first time.

06:01.215 --> 06:03.852
But you don't have
anything to worry about.

06:03.853 --> 06:06.585
Yeah, what's the worst
that can happen?

06:06.586 --> 06:09.277
Your parents make a bad
impression, he dumps you.

06:09.278 --> 06:13.558
And you lose your soul mate...
forever.

06:13.559 --> 06:16.400
I just really want you
guys to like him.

06:16.401 --> 06:18.620
Didi, relax. You're my sister.

06:18.621 --> 06:22.521
I'm gonna like whoever you like.

06:22.533 --> 06:26.587
- Hello, darlin'.
- My boyfriend's here!

06:26.588 --> 06:30.128
Chuck's your new boyfriend?!

06:30.245 --> 06:32.105
Dez!

06:39.977 --> 06:42.017
Dez. Dez.

06:42.018 --> 06:44.705
- Are you okay?
- Oh, man.

06:44.706 --> 06:48.679
I just had a terrible nightmare. My
sister was dating my worst enemy.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.546
That wasn't a nightmare, Red.

06:51.547 --> 06:54.582
Didi, how long have you
been dating Chuck McCoy?

06:54.583 --> 06:58.942
We started hanging out over the summer,
and we've been video-chatting ever since.

06:58.943 --> 07:01.413
Didi, you know how we feel
about the McCoy family...

07:01.414 --> 07:02.747
And video-chatting.

07:02.748 --> 07:07.492
Dad, Chuck's the nicest, smartest,
most handsome boy in the world.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.655
Is she talking about that Chuck?

07:09.656 --> 07:13.574
Sir, I know there's bad
blood between our families.

07:13.575 --> 07:16.728
But I like your daughter almost
as much as I like my boots.

07:16.729 --> 07:20.269
And I really like my boots.

07:21.163 --> 07:25.899
Okay, Dez, I know why you and Chuck don't
get along, but why don't your families?

07:25.900 --> 07:29.267
Our families have hated each other
as far back as anyone can remember.

07:29.268 --> 07:31.222
It's been going on
since the middle ages.

07:31.223 --> 07:34.864
Well, I think it's romantic
Didi and Chuck are going out.

07:34.865 --> 07:37.857
It's like Romeo and Juliet.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.111
You know how that ended, right?

07:40.112 --> 07:41.653
Not good.

07:41.654 --> 07:44.131
Well, Didi is my Juliet.

07:44.132 --> 07:49.404
The brightness of her cheek would shame
the stars, as daylight doth a lamp.

07:49.405 --> 07:51.325
Aw...

07:51.698 --> 07:53.248
Ewe.

07:53.249 --> 07:55.403
I think you should
give Chuck a chance.

07:55.404 --> 07:58.051
Love is the strongest
thing in nature.

07:58.052 --> 08:00.216
Actually, a hippo's the
strongest thing in nature.

08:00.217 --> 08:02.167
You know what I mean.

08:02.168 --> 08:05.577
And you're wrong.
It's a rhinoceros.

08:05.578 --> 08:07.261
I agree with Ally.

08:07.262 --> 08:10.011
About giving Chuck a
chance or the rhinoceros?

08:10.012 --> 08:11.583
The Chuck thing.

08:11.584 --> 08:16.688
Please, Sir, I stood ankle-deep
in cockroaches for your daughter.

08:16.689 --> 08:19.424
What else can you call
that besides love?

08:19.425 --> 08:22.169
Stupid, disgusting,
unsanitary...

08:22.170 --> 08:23.859
Should I go on?

08:23.860 --> 08:25.987
Don't listen to Chuck, Mom.

08:25.988 --> 08:28.583
- You can't trust him.
- I'm with Dez.

08:28.584 --> 08:30.934
He's just mad because I
always beat him at stuff.

08:30.935 --> 08:35.150
Uh, did you forget that I beat you at the
chili cook-off and the short story contest?

08:35.152 --> 08:40.192
I believe that's 27 for
you and two a-for me.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.714
What up?!

08:42.715 --> 08:44.959
Dad, don't you want
me to be happy?

08:44.960 --> 08:49.171
I do. It's just that his last name
is McCoy and our last name is...

08:49.172 --> 08:52.070
Dad's right! Our families have been
fighting since the middle ages...

08:52.071 --> 08:54.726
And we'll still be fighting when
the zombie apocalypse comes.

08:54.727 --> 08:56.190
I don't think so.

08:56.191 --> 08:59.140
Only two things are gonna
survive the zombie apocalypse.

08:59.141 --> 09:02.478
Me and my love for Didi.

09:02.479 --> 09:05.128
Oh-ho-ho! I'm
definitely surviving.

09:05.129 --> 09:08.576
I never leave home without
my zombie survival kit.

09:08.577 --> 09:10.067
Except for today.

09:10.068 --> 09:15.968
I had to bring the cake, and I
couldn't carry two things at once.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.286
Welcome to the family, son.

09:21.287 --> 09:25.524
We love hanging out with
you so much more than Dez.

09:25.525 --> 09:27.865
Who's Dez?

09:29.762 --> 09:31.120
Who wants another Panini?

09:31.121 --> 09:32.981
Ooh!

09:34.636 --> 09:36.756
No-o-o-o!

09:36.757 --> 09:39.217
No-o-o-o!

09:40.054 --> 09:41.448
Dez, are you okay?

09:41.449 --> 09:42.851
Uh, didn't you hear me?

09:42.852 --> 09:45.312
No-o-o-o!

09:45.411 --> 09:48.160
I have to break up Chuck and
Didi before it's too late.

09:48.161 --> 09:50.203
He was using my Panini press.

09:50.204 --> 09:51.194
- How dare he.
- What?

09:51.195 --> 09:52.277
Who cares?

09:52.278 --> 09:56.722
You care more about this feud
than your sister's feelings?

09:56.723 --> 09:58.038
Ally's right.

09:58.039 --> 10:00.288
Whatever you need, buddy,
I'll help you break them up.

10:00.289 --> 10:02.627
That's not what I meant.

10:02.628 --> 10:04.440
Whose side are you on, Ally?

10:04.441 --> 10:07.150
- I'm on the side of love.
- And I'm on the side of Dez.

10:07.151 --> 10:09.668
And I'm on the side of
anyone who pays me 20 bucks.

10:09.669 --> 10:11.234
Thanks, Trish.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.672
You and Austin will help me
break up Chuck and my sister.

10:13.673 --> 10:16.273
I still think this
whole feud is crazy.

10:16.274 --> 10:19.828
Haven't we learned anything
from Romeo and Juliet?

10:19.829 --> 10:22.463
These violent delights
have violent ends!

10:22.464 --> 10:25.751
A plague on both your houses!

10:25.752 --> 10:28.812
Why do I know that?!

10:33.371 --> 10:34.552
Yes!

10:34.553 --> 10:36.334
I just talked to Trish.
We're all set.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.106
Thanks, buddy.

10:38.107 --> 10:40.390
What are you two up to?

10:40.391 --> 10:44.771
- Nothing.
- Breaking up Chuck and Didi.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.407
- Chuck.
- Red.

10:47.408 --> 10:50.996
I was just showing Didi all the
pictures I have of her in my locker.

10:50.997 --> 10:53.025
I love this little gal.

10:53.026 --> 10:56.432
Sure you do. Hey, let's
listen to the radio.

10:56.433 --> 11:00.364
This is DJ Trish, bringing
you love in the afternoon.

11:00.365 --> 11:03.853
Our first request is Austin
Moon's I think about you.

11:03.854 --> 11:07.095
This goes out from Chuck McCoy
to the girl of his dreams...

11:07.096 --> 11:08.700
Oh, that's so sweet.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.729
- Sally.
- What?!

11:10.730 --> 11:13.088
He says he knows that
things are complicated,

11:13.089 --> 11:15.700
but as soon as you-know-who
is out of the picture...

11:15.701 --> 11:16.929
Didi...

11:16.930 --> 11:19.252
You two can be together.

11:19.253 --> 11:20.408
Dez was right.

11:20.409 --> 11:22.091
I shouldn't have
trusted a McCoy.

11:22.092 --> 11:23.632
We're finished!

11:23.633 --> 11:25.973
Didi, wait!

11:27.873 --> 11:29.307
What up?!

11:29.308 --> 11:31.260
I can't believe you guys.

11:31.261 --> 11:33.277
- You all set me up!
- Maybe.

11:33.278 --> 11:35.687
But you'll never be
with my sister again.

11:35.688 --> 11:37.489
You're gonna pay for this, Red.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.007
You too, blondie.

11:39.008 --> 11:40.430
And you too...

11:40.431 --> 11:44.054
Whatever-color-your-hair-is.

11:44.055 --> 11:46.947
I didn't have anything
to do with it!

11:46.948 --> 11:51.328
And it's chestnut with
amber highlights.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.074

12:00.367 --> 12:02.167
Ow.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.672
Ow.

12:03.673 --> 12:05.507
Ow. Look what Chuck did to me!

12:05.508 --> 12:09.341
He put a pinch me sign on my shirt.
Everybody's been pinching me all day.

12:09.342 --> 12:11.177
Why don't you just take it off?

12:11.178 --> 12:13.011
Because it's my favorite shirt.

12:13.012 --> 12:15.373
Not the shirt, the sign.

12:15.374 --> 12:17.174
Oh.

12:20.943 --> 12:24.220
You should apologize to
Chuck and end your feud.

12:24.221 --> 12:27.919
Ally, sometimes people just have to
stand up for what they believe in.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.058
And you think a ridiculous
old feud is more

12:30.059 --> 12:33.578
important than two teenagers
who wanna be together?

12:33.579 --> 12:35.307
When you put it like that...

12:35.308 --> 12:36.763
Maybe?

12:36.764 --> 12:39.454
You're just worried Chuck's
gonna get back at you too.

12:39.455 --> 12:43.775
This isn't about me.
It's about Didi.

12:45.435 --> 12:49.671
Okay, now it's about me too.
What is this stuff?!

12:49.672 --> 12:51.810
Mm. It's strawberry jam.

12:51.811 --> 12:53.759
He's so diabolical!

12:53.760 --> 12:56.509
Do you know how much
that stuff stains?

12:56.510 --> 13:01.139
Well, if that's his
prank, it's pretty lame.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.890
Huh. This key sounds weird.

13:03.891 --> 13:06.591
Austin! Don't...

13:10.677 --> 13:13.004
Relax, Dez.

13:13.005 --> 13:18.905
Chuck didn't do anything to the piano.
I've been here all afternoon.

13:24.132 --> 13:26.952
Man... he's good.

13:28.761 --> 13:30.904
I should have charged you
a lot more than 20 bucks

13:30.905 --> 13:33.025
to help you break
up Chuck and Didi.

13:33.026 --> 13:35.801
Dez, you have got to end this
feud before it gets out of hand.

13:35.802 --> 13:38.034
Ho-ho-ho, I'm never
ending this feud.

13:38.035 --> 13:39.889
Besides, Chuck's not
gonna do anything else.

13:39.890 --> 13:43.370
He already got his revenge.

13:50.114 --> 13:55.634
Maybe he does still have a
little revenge left in him.

13:59.089 --> 14:03.709
Well, looky who suddenly
has school spirit.

14:04.808 --> 14:08.436
I had to buy all new clothes from
the school store because of you!

14:08.437 --> 14:10.403
And I always had school spirit.

14:10.404 --> 14:12.934
Go-o-o-o Manatees!

14:12.935 --> 14:16.337
But seriously, the jelly
attacks have to stop!

14:16.338 --> 14:19.075
I suppose I could do some, uh...

14:19.076 --> 14:21.509
Peanut butter attacks
to even it out!

14:21.510 --> 14:23.852
Don't you dare.

14:23.853 --> 14:27.605
Lucky for you, this is my
emergency peanut butter.

14:27.606 --> 14:32.226
I'm putting it in my
zombie survival kit.

14:32.647 --> 14:34.788
There's been a lot of
chatter on the interwebs

14:34.789 --> 14:38.027
lately about the impending
zombie apocalypse.

14:38.028 --> 14:40.096
Oh, I've heard the chatter.

14:40.097 --> 14:42.131
There will be a zombie
apocalypse any day now.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.963
Could be tomorrow, could be the next
day, could be the day after that,

14:44.964 --> 14:46.410
could be the day after that.

14:46.411 --> 14:48.472
Could be the day after...

14:48.473 --> 14:50.552
I get it.

14:50.553 --> 14:52.208
It's coming.

14:52.209 --> 14:54.709
And when it comes...

14:54.710 --> 14:59.060
I'm gonna survive, because I have
the best zombie survival kit...

14:59.061 --> 15:02.061
In Southeast Florida.

15:05.189 --> 15:09.329
You call that a
zombie survival kit?

15:12.129 --> 15:14.864
This is a zombie survival kit.

15:14.865 --> 15:18.916
Mine's got zombie repellent, two-way
radio, night-vision goggles.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.208
And best of all,
it's zombie-proof.

15:21.209 --> 15:25.889
No one knows the
combination except for me.

15:35.469 --> 15:39.907
Zero-zero-zero-zero is the
best you could come up with?

15:39.908 --> 15:43.974
Trust me. Zombies are the
least of your worries.

15:43.975 --> 15:47.995
My revenge is just
getting started.

15:54.905 --> 15:57.974
All we have to do is stay here
until Chuck goes to college.

15:57.975 --> 16:00.398
Then we'll be safe.

16:00.399 --> 16:03.033
So living in the practice
room for three years

16:03.034 --> 16:05.393
is easier than ending
your feud with Chuck?

16:05.394 --> 16:08.574
Yes, Ally. Yes, it is.

16:09.245 --> 16:14.945
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to use the bathroom.

16:18.001 --> 16:21.961
He know that's the
closet, right?

16:22.793 --> 16:26.539
You've gotta help us put an end
to this feud, it's gone too far.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.658
Dez is prepared to sleep
in the practice room

16:28.659 --> 16:32.796
and eat nothing but
tuna for three years.

16:32.797 --> 16:35.880
So that's where all the tuna
from my zombie shelter went.

16:35.881 --> 16:38.916
You believe in that dumb
zombie apocalypse stuff too?

16:38.917 --> 16:41.137
Uh, yeah.

16:41.893 --> 16:43.379
I agree with Ally.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.619
This feud has gone
on long enough.

16:45.620 --> 16:49.502
I mean, poor Didi's
been crying for days.

16:49.503 --> 16:52.216
The best way to end a feud
is to get two people in the

16:52.217 --> 16:55.067
same room together so they can
air out their differences.

16:55.068 --> 16:58.284
Chuck and Dez hate each other. They'll
never get in a room together.

16:58.285 --> 17:01.002
I think I have a way. But
I'll need some help.

17:01.003 --> 17:01.960
I'm in!

17:01.961 --> 17:04.076
- Me too!
- Count me in.

17:04.077 --> 17:06.597
For 20 bucks.

17:21.335 --> 17:23.375
Austin?

17:23.631 --> 17:25.162
Ally?

17:25.163 --> 17:27.502
Hello, Red.

17:28.876 --> 17:31.918
Back off, Chuck. I'm not
afraid to use this flute.

17:31.919 --> 17:35.999
I've been taking
lessons from Ally.

17:37.394 --> 17:40.923
Easy there, partner. I
didn't come to get revenge.

17:40.924 --> 17:44.501
Ally texted me about a pie-baking
contest in Sonic Boom.

17:44.502 --> 17:47.304
I've got all this leftover jam
and nothing to do with it.

17:47.305 --> 17:50.712
If there was a pie-baking contest,
I would have gotten the same text.

17:50.713 --> 17:53.373
Ally knows how much
I love baking pies.

17:53.374 --> 17:56.854
Clearly I've been lied to.

17:59.842 --> 18:01.285
What's going on?

18:01.286 --> 18:02.553
I don't know.

18:02.554 --> 18:05.724
That's an emergency siren.
Let's check the radio.

18:05.725 --> 18:09.042
This is not a test. I
repeat, this is not a test.

18:09.043 --> 18:11.803
I've just gotten a report from
the South Florida Naval Station

18:11.804 --> 18:13.430
that a virus has leaked out.

18:13.431 --> 18:15.580
It's turning people into...
gasp...

18:15.581 --> 18:17.234
Zombies!

18:17.235 --> 18:19.957
- Did she just say...?
- Yes, you heard right. I just said...

18:19.958 --> 18:22.598
Gasp... zombies!

18:23.290 --> 18:28.030
I'm calling Austin.
He'll know what to do.

18:28.445 --> 18:31.381
Dez? I'm so glad to
hear your voice.

18:31.382 --> 18:34.118
There's not much time to talk.
The zombies are everywhere.

18:34.119 --> 18:36.819
Must eat brains!

18:38.493 --> 18:41.905
Really? That's the
best you can do?

18:41.906 --> 18:44.294
The zombie apocalypse
is actually happening?

18:44.295 --> 18:48.332
Yes, and in case I don't see you
again, I just have one thing to say...

18:48.333 --> 18:49.937
Life's too short
to hold a grudge.

18:49.938 --> 18:53.938
If you're feuding with anybody,
now's the time to end it.

18:53.939 --> 18:56.852
I think the zombies may
have already gotten him.

18:56.853 --> 18:59.772
He's talking gibberish.

18:59.773 --> 19:03.870
- What should we do?
- Many callers are asking what to do.

19:03.871 --> 19:05.832
You need to lock
yourselves in a room.

19:05.833 --> 19:08.931
Like a practice room with
lots of water and tuna!

19:08.932 --> 19:14.332
We have a practice room with
lots of water and tuna.

19:17.372 --> 19:20.307
It's only been three minutes, and
already I'm feeling lightheaded.

19:20.308 --> 19:22.454
Will there be enough
air to survive?

19:22.455 --> 19:24.638
Will the rescuers get
here before the zombies?

19:24.639 --> 19:26.640
If you're watching this...

19:26.641 --> 19:29.401
The answer's no.

19:30.610 --> 19:32.920
- I'm worried about Didi.
- I'm worried about my lungs.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.842
- We're running out of air in here!
- Snap out of it, Red!

19:35.843 --> 19:39.083
It's no time to panic!

19:40.183 --> 19:42.045
You're right.

19:42.046 --> 19:45.531
Music always calms me down.
Let's listen to the radio.

19:45.532 --> 19:48.870
They're in the Mall.
Run for your lives!

19:48.871 --> 19:51.631
Forget the radio.

19:54.049 --> 19:58.009
- They're here!
- Block the door!

20:04.130 --> 20:06.590
Me love brains!

20:06.591 --> 20:08.571
Blehh!

20:12.358 --> 20:14.418
It's been almost an hour.

20:14.419 --> 20:18.503
And except for electricity, Internet
connection, working phones.

20:18.504 --> 20:23.160
Three years' worth of water and
tuna, and the company of Chuck...

20:23.161 --> 20:28.861
I am completely alone and cut
off from the outside world.

20:30.352 --> 20:32.303
We haven't heard
anything for a while.

20:32.304 --> 20:35.505
I say we go downstairs and
see if the zombies are gone.

20:35.506 --> 20:37.015
I got your back.

20:37.016 --> 20:38.882
That's mighty kind of you, Red.

20:38.883 --> 20:42.039
Besides, everyone knows zombies
can't chase two people at once.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.594
I don't have to outrun them.

20:43.595 --> 20:46.530
I just have to outrun you.

20:46.531 --> 20:49.651
That was my plan too.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.861
All clear.

21:05.862 --> 21:07.842
Hiyah!

21:16.431 --> 21:18.650
The zombies were
definitely here.

21:18.651 --> 21:21.591
Look at this place.

21:22.225 --> 21:24.226
I can't believe how
brave you are, Red...

21:24.227 --> 21:27.887
Laughing at a time like this.

21:31.908 --> 21:34.269
Chuck, look! Zombie!

21:34.270 --> 21:36.683
Oh, no! That's my Didi!

21:36.684 --> 21:39.791
That's my sister. I can't believe
she turned into a zombie.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.615
I feel awful.

21:41.616 --> 21:43.694
If I had been with her, this
wouldn't have happened!

21:43.695 --> 21:45.787
It's all my fault. I'm
sorry I broke you two up.

21:45.788 --> 21:48.316
- I just want this feud to end.
- Me too, partner.

21:48.317 --> 21:49.762
If we don't make it out of this,

21:49.763 --> 21:53.561
I just want you to know, I'd be proud
if you were my sister's boyfriend.

21:53.562 --> 21:57.783
I can't do that now.
She's a zombie.

21:57.784 --> 22:03.004
But thank you, Red. I'm
proud to call you friend.

22:07.436 --> 22:10.312
- We got you!
- Woo! Yeah!

22:10.313 --> 22:15.143
Yeah, we had you believing in...
gasp... zombies!

22:15.144 --> 22:17.217
You should have seen your face.

22:17.218 --> 22:20.528
Oh, no! I'm so scared,
instead of scaredy-cats,

22:20.529 --> 22:23.978
people are gonna call
'em Chucky-cats.

22:23.979 --> 22:25.796
Wait, this was all a hoax?

22:25.797 --> 22:28.029
We wanted you and Chuck
to end your dumb feud.

22:28.030 --> 22:32.294
We figured if we got you scared enough,
you'd work together and stop fighting.

22:32.295 --> 22:33.853
And it worked.

22:33.854 --> 22:35.604
- I wasn't scared.
- Me neither.

22:35.605 --> 22:39.805
Then why are you
still holding hands?

22:46.375 --> 22:49.244
Dez, I promise I'll
take good care of her.

22:49.245 --> 22:53.696
I know. But if you want my approval,
we have to go over this one more time.

22:53.697 --> 22:57.678
- Oh! Do we have to?
- Yes, I'm very protective.

22:57.679 --> 22:59.498
Now, Chuck...

22:59.499 --> 23:01.425
- You treat her right.
- Got it.

23:01.426 --> 23:04.634
Be patient. She's temperamental.

23:04.635 --> 23:06.645
I understand.

23:06.646 --> 23:10.166
And I want her
back after dinner.

23:10.167 --> 23:14.007
Man, you love your Panini press.

23:14.937 --> 23:18.379
She's like a sister to me.
