>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:30.967 --> 00:32.967
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:33.033 --> 00:35.166
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.233 --> 00:35.967
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:36.033 --> 00:39.834
US.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.133
AND, LOOK, I KNOW THAT WE

00:41.200 --> 00:42.433
USUALLY START WITH A QUICK RECAP

00:42.500 --> 00:43.967
OF THE WEEK, BUT TONIGHT, THIS

00:44.066 --> 00:45.433
ENTIRE SHOW IS BASICALLY GOING

00:45.500 --> 00:47.500
TO BE ONE LONG RECAP OF ONE VERY

00:47.567 --> 00:48.734
LONG WEEK AND ONE EVENT IN

00:48.800 --> 00:50.266
PARTICULAR MEANING THAT SADLY,

00:50.333 --> 00:52.300
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO TIME TO

00:52.367 --> 00:54.367
TALK ABOUT TRUMP INSISTING THE

00:54.433 --> 00:56.333
U.N. WAS LAUGHING WITH, NOT AT

00:56.400 --> 00:57.800
HIM -- WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY

00:57.867 --> 00:59.233
WASN'T -- NOR TIME TO DELVE INTO

00:59.300 --> 01:00.734
WHAT WAS CLEARLY THE MOST FUN

01:00.800 --> 01:04.300
STORY OF THE WEEK, THIS:

01:04.367 --> 01:05.467
>> WELL, THE PHILADELPHIA FLYERS

01:05.533 --> 01:06.266
HAVE A NEW MASCOT, AND FANS ARE

01:06.333 --> 01:06.867
SAYING, "WHAT THE..."

01:06.934 --> 01:08.266
THAT'S 7' TALL GRITTY.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.266
GRITTY UNVEILED TODAY IN FRONT

01:09.333 --> 01:10.967
OF A GROUP OF KIDS, PROBABLY

01:11.033 --> 01:12.867
SCARRED FOR LIFE.

01:12.934 --> 01:14.266
>> John: YEAH, YEAH, THOSE KIDS

01:14.333 --> 01:15.567
SHOULD BE SCARRED FOR LIFE.

01:15.633 --> 01:17.800
GRITTY IS FUCKING HORRIFIC.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.000
EVERY SINGLE PHOTO OF HIM IS

01:19.066 --> 01:20.166
APPALLING.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.600
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS ONE.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.066
THAT IS A NIGHTMARE.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.133
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.500
THAT IS SIMPLY PSYCHOTIC.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.700
GRITTY LOOKS LIKE THE END RESULT

01:27.767 --> 01:29.300
OF THE ORANGE McDONALDS FRY GUY

01:29.367 --> 01:33.934
HOOKING UP WITH GRIMACE.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.066
AND WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS A

01:39.133 --> 01:40.867
MILLION TIMES ON THIS SHOW: IF

01:40.934 --> 01:42.467
YOU'RE A McDONALD'S MASCOT, YOU

01:42.533 --> 01:43.400
DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH

01:43.467 --> 01:44.433
ANOTHER McDONALDS MASCOT.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.266
YOUR GENETICS ARE TOO SIMILAR

01:45.333 --> 01:46.033
AND THE KIDS ALWAYS TURN OUT

01:46.100 --> 01:46.867
WEIRD.

01:46.934 --> 01:47.700
VERY, VERY WEIRD.

01:47.767 --> 01:48.333
AND INCIDENTALLY, IT'S NOT LIKE

01:48.400 --> 01:49.667
GRITTY HAS ANY BUSINESS BEING A

01:49.700 --> 01:53.500
HOCKEY MASCOT.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.967
>> APPARENTLY, HE HASN'T REALLY

01:55.033 --> 01:55.567
FIGURED OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE ON

01:55.633 --> 01:55.967
THE ICE YET.

01:56.033 --> 01:56.767
HE FELL MULTIPLE TIMES IN HIS

01:56.834 --> 01:57.767
DEBUT LAST NIGHT.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.767
THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS

01:59.834 --> 02:00.867
TWEETING, "LOL, OKAY."

02:00.934 --> 02:01.934
TO WHICH GRITTY RESPONDED,

02:01.967 --> 02:03.133
"SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN

02:03.200 --> 02:05.567
TONIGHT, BIRD."

02:05.633 --> 02:06.667
>> John: HOLY SHIT, GRITTY.

02:06.734 --> 02:08.600
CALM DOWN.

02:08.667 --> 02:09.900
THEY'RE JUST ENGAGING IN SOME

02:09.967 --> 02:10.934
INTER-TEAM BANTER, AND YOU'VE

02:10.967 --> 02:12.367
GONE STRAIGHT TO "I WILL MURDER

02:12.433 --> 02:14.533
YOU IN YOUR SLEEP."

02:14.600 --> 02:21.233
AND, LOOK, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

02:21.300 --> 02:22.633
NOTHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO

02:22.700 --> 02:24.066
MORE THAN TALK ABOUT GRITTY ALL

02:24.133 --> 02:26.633
NIGHT LONG, FROM THE FACT HE'S

02:26.700 --> 02:27.367
ALREADY DONE A

02:27.433 --> 02:28.066
KIM KARDASHIAN-STYLE

02:28.133 --> 02:29.033
PHOTO SHOOT TO THE FACT THAT --

02:29.100 --> 02:29.767
AND THIS IS TRUE -- SOMEONE HAS

02:29.834 --> 02:30.500
ALREADY GOT AN ACTUAL TATTOO OF

02:30.567 --> 02:31.367
HIM ON THEIR BODY.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.633
INTERESTINGLY, THAT SOMEONE?

02:32.700 --> 02:34.200
JIMMY CARTER.

02:34.266 --> 02:36.300
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH, THE FUN WE

02:36.367 --> 02:37.367
JUST HAD MUST NOW STOP, BECAUSE

02:37.433 --> 02:38.600
INSTEAD WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

02:38.667 --> 02:39.667
BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT

02:39.734 --> 02:40.767
NOMINEE AND WALKING CRUSHED BEER

02:40.834 --> 02:44.033
CAN.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.467
NOW, ON THURSDAY,

02:47.533 --> 02:48.467
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, WHO HAS

02:48.533 --> 02:49.533
ACCUSED KAVANAUGH OF SEXUALLY

02:49.600 --> 02:50.433
ASSAULTING HER IN 1982, CAME

02:50.500 --> 02:51.300
BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY

02:51.367 --> 02:52.600
COMMITTEE TO DELIVER SOME

02:52.667 --> 02:53.934
POWERFUL TESTIMONY.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.400
>> I AM HERE TODAY NOT BECAUSE I

02:55.467 --> 02:56.500
WANT TO BE.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.734
I AM TERRIFIED.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.300
I AM HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT

03:00.367 --> 03:02.233
IS MY CIVIC DUTY TO TELL YOU

03:02.300 --> 03:03.266
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHILE

03:03.333 --> 03:04.200
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I WERE IN

03:04.266 --> 03:05.967
HIGH SCHOOL.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.300
>> John: RIGHT.

03:07.367 --> 03:11.467
AND SHE DID JUST THAT,

03:11.533 --> 03:12.867
DESCRIBING IN DETAIL HER

03:12.934 --> 03:13.567
RECOLLECTION OF HOW A DRUNK

03:13.633 --> 03:14.567
KAVANAUGH PINNED HER

03:14.633 --> 03:15.300
DOWN, TRIED TO REMOVE HER

03:15.367 --> 03:16.200
CLOTHING, AND PUT HIS HAND OVER

03:16.266 --> 03:17.100
HER MOUTH WHEN SHE TRIED TO

03:17.166 --> 03:18.834
SCREAM.

03:18.900 --> 03:19.967
SHE INSISTED THAT THIS COULD NOT

03:20.033 --> 03:21.333
POSSIBLY BE A CASE OF MISTAKEN

03:21.400 --> 03:21.934
IDENTITY, BECAUSE SHE WAS 100%

03:21.967 --> 03:24.467
CERTAIN IT WAS HIM.

03:24.533 --> 03:26.867
AND AFTER HER OPENING STATEMENT,

03:26.934 --> 03:28.166
SHE THEN TOOK QUESTIONS, WHICH

03:28.233 --> 03:31.533
SOMETIMES TOOK AN ODD TURN, LIKE

03:31.600 --> 03:32.433
WHEN THE PROSECUTOR TO WHOM THE

03:32.500 --> 03:33.367
REPUBLICANS HAD OUTSOURCED THEIR

03:33.433 --> 03:34.200
RESPONSIBILITIES SEIZED ON A

03:34.266 --> 03:35.100
POLYGRAPH TEST THAT FORD HAD

03:35.166 --> 03:36.133
PASSED.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.734
>> DID YOU PAY FOR THE POLYGRAPH

03:37.800 --> 03:40.200
YOURSELF?

03:40.266 --> 03:42.567
>> I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK SO.

03:42.633 --> 03:42.967
>> OKAY.

03:43.066 --> 03:44.066
DO YOU KNOW WHO DID PAY FOR THE

03:44.133 --> 03:45.533
POLYGRAPH?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.700
>> NOT YET, NO.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.033
>> I BELIEVE YOU SAID IT HASN'T

03:48.100 --> 03:48.967
BEEN PAID FOR YET.

03:49.033 --> 03:53.133
IS THAT CORRECT?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.100
>> LET ME PUT AN END TO THIS

03:55.166 --> 03:55.667
MISERY.

03:55.734 --> 03:56.667
HER LAWYERS HAVE PAID FOR HER

03:56.734 --> 03:59.967
POLYGRAPH.

04:00.033 --> 04:05.000
>> AS IS ROUTINE.

04:05.066 --> 04:06.633
>> John: WAIT, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:06.700 --> 04:12.100
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:12.166 --> 04:15.667
SLOW YOUR ROLL THERE.

04:15.734 --> 04:16.567
"AS IS ROUTINE"?

04:16.633 --> 04:17.200
DON'T TRY AND BRUSH HER QUESTION

04:17.266 --> 04:18.033
ASIDE!

04:18.100 --> 04:18.767
SHE JUST CRACKED THE CASE WIDE

04:18.834 --> 04:19.700
OPEN!

04:19.767 --> 04:20.600
SHE FOUND THE MISSING PIECE TO

04:20.667 --> 04:21.333
THE PUZZLE, SPECIFICALLY, A

04:21.400 --> 04:22.734
PUZZLE THAT READS "WHO FUCKING

04:22.800 --> 04:23.133
CARES?"

04:23.200 --> 04:24.133
FORD'S TESTIMONY WAS BRAVE AND

04:24.200 --> 04:25.066
COMPELLING AND SEEMED TO AFFECT

04:25.133 --> 04:26.000
MANY ON THE COMMITTEE, INCLUDING

04:26.066 --> 04:27.200
REPUBLICAN SENATOR ORRIN HATCH,

04:27.266 --> 04:28.367
WHO CHOSE TO EXPRESS HIS

04:28.433 --> 04:29.500
ADMIRATION IN A FAR FROM IDEAL

04:29.567 --> 04:30.300
WAY.

04:30.367 --> 04:31.600
>> HAVE YOU FOUND DR. FORD

04:31.667 --> 04:32.300
CREDIBLE?

04:32.367 --> 04:33.934
>> WELL, IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.433
I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T THINK

04:35.500 --> 04:37.700
SHE'S UN-CREDIBLE.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.200
I THINK SHE'S ATTRACTIVE --

04:39.266 --> 04:41.533
A GOOD WITNESS.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.533
BUT IT'S WAY EARLY --

04:42.600 --> 04:44.000
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY

04:44.066 --> 04:46.266
"ATTRACTIVE," SIR?

04:46.333 --> 04:48.033
>> OH.

04:48.133 --> 04:53.133
IN OTHER WORDS, SHE'S PLEASING.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.233
>> John: OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!

04:56.300 --> 04:59.600
"PLEASING"?

04:59.667 --> 05:00.467
YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE WORD

05:00.533 --> 05:01.200
"PLEASING" TO DESCRIBE A SEXUAL

05:01.266 --> 05:01.800
ASSAULT SURVIVOR PAINFULLY

05:01.867 --> 05:02.567
RECOUNTING ONE OF THE WORST

05:02.633 --> 05:03.200
MOMENTS OF HER LIFE.

05:03.266 --> 05:04.333
YOU HONESTLY SHOULDN'T REALLY

05:04.400 --> 05:05.300
USE IT TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING.

05:05.367 --> 05:09.100
MAYBE, MAYBE WATCHING MILK MIX

05:09.166 --> 05:09.500
INTO YOUR COFFEE.

05:09.567 --> 05:09.967
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:10.033 --> 05:10.600
NOT EVEN THEN.

05:10.667 --> 05:11.767
BECAUSE THE MOMENT YOU SAY,

05:11.834 --> 05:12.967
"WATCHING THIS MILK IS

05:13.066 --> 05:13.900
PLEASING," YOU COME OFF LIKE A

05:13.967 --> 05:14.834
CREEP WHO'S WAITING FOR EVERYONE

05:14.900 --> 05:15.900
TO LEAVE THE ROOM SO HE CAN FUCK

05:15.967 --> 05:18.633
HIS COFFEE.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.333
THE POINT IS, BY LUNCHTIME ON

05:20.400 --> 05:22.033
THURSDAY, IT HONESTLY SEEMED

05:22.100 --> 05:23.867
THAT KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION

05:23.934 --> 05:24.900
COULD BE FINISHED.

05:24.967 --> 05:25.967
EVEN FOX NEWS WAS IMPLYING AS

05:26.033 --> 05:28.934
MUCH.

05:28.967 --> 05:30.567
>> THIS WAS EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL,

05:30.633 --> 05:32.633
EXTREMELY RAW, AND EXTREMELY

05:32.700 --> 05:39.633
CREDIBLE.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.867
AND NOBODY COULD LISTEN TO HER

05:42.934 --> 05:43.934
DELIVER THOSE WORDS AND TALK

05:44.000 --> 05:44.834
ABOUT THE ASSAULT AND THE IMPACT

05:44.900 --> 05:45.700
IT HAD ON HER LIFE AND NOT HAVE

05:45.767 --> 05:47.734
YOUR HEART GO OUT TO HER.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.266
THIS IS A DISASTER FOR THE

05:48.333 --> 05:51.000
REPUBLICANS.

05:51.066 --> 05:52.300
>> John: THAT IS FOX NEWS

05:52.367 --> 05:53.967
CALLING FORD'S TESTIMONY A

05:54.033 --> 05:55.266
DISASTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS,

05:55.333 --> 05:56.333
AND NOT LIKE ONE OF THOSE

05:56.400 --> 05:58.266
PUERTO RICO DISASTERS.

05:58.333 --> 05:59.400
YOU KNOW, THIS TIME, ONE THEY

05:59.467 --> 06:01.533
MIGHT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
BUT THEN -- THEN CAME

06:02.667 --> 06:08.066
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY.

06:08.133 --> 06:08.934
AND IT IS WORTH LOOKING IN

06:09.000 --> 06:09.800
DETAIL TONIGHT.

06:09.867 --> 06:10.600
BECAUSE IN EVERY REGARD, IT

06:10.667 --> 06:11.433
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE

06:11.500 --> 06:12.166
DIFFERENT FROM FORD'S.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.066
FOR STARTERS, WHILE SHE WAS

06:13.133 --> 06:14.066
REMARKABLY COMPOSED IN

06:14.133 --> 06:14.934
DISCUSSING TRAUMATIC DETAILS,

06:15.033 --> 06:16.133
KAVANAUGH CAME STRAIGHT OUT OF

06:16.233 --> 06:17.800
THE GATE WEIRD IN HIS OPENING

06:17.867 --> 06:19.367
STATEMENT, NOT JUST DENYING ALL

06:19.433 --> 06:20.567
HER ALLEGATIONS, BUT ALMOST

06:20.633 --> 06:22.100
BREAKING DOWN WHILE ATTEMPTING

06:22.166 --> 06:23.266
TO PAINT A FOLKSY IMAGE OF HIS

06:23.333 --> 06:25.900
TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.033
>> I WORKED OUT WITH OTHER GUYS

06:27.100 --> 06:38.633
AT TOBIN'S HOUSE.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.667
HE WAS THE GREAT QUARTERBACK ON

06:40.734 --> 06:41.967
OUR FOOTBALL TEAM AND HIS DAD

06:42.066 --> 06:44.633
RAN WORKOUTS.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.967
>> John: YEAH, HE'S CRYING AT

06:46.066 --> 06:47.667
THE MEMORY OF LIFTING WEIGHTS AT

06:47.734 --> 06:50.300
HIS FRIEND TOBIN'S HOUSE.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.934
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I'M

06:52.967 --> 06:54.433
STARTING TO THINK THAT MEN MIGHT

06:54.500 --> 06:55.400
BE TOO EMOTIONAL FOR THE

06:55.467 --> 06:59.700
SUPREME COURT.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.166
ALSO -- ALSO -- ALSO, HE'D BE

07:01.233 --> 07:05.000
REALLY PRETTY IF HE SMILED MORE.

07:05.066 --> 07:06.667
AND IT WASN'T JUST MEMORIES OF A

07:06.734 --> 07:07.900
HIGH SCHOOL QUARTERBACK THAT WAS

07:07.967 --> 07:09.100
MAKING HIM TEAR UP.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.934
>> I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF

07:11.000 --> 07:12.967
CLOSE FEMALE FRIENDS.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.233
I REMEMBER TALKING ALMOST EVERY

07:14.300 --> 07:15.967
NIGHT, IT SEEMED, TO MY FRIENDS

07:16.033 --> 07:24.400
AMY OR JULIE...

07:24.467 --> 07:27.233
OR KRISTIN OR KAREN OR SUZANNE

07:27.300 --> 07:29.400
OR MOIRA OR MEGAN OR NIKKI.

07:29.467 --> 07:32.500
THE LIST GOES ON.

07:32.567 --> 07:33.500
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S NOT

07:33.567 --> 07:37.033
TESTIMONY THOUGH, IS IT?

07:37.100 --> 07:38.734
IT IS A PLAINTIVE, SPOKEN WORD

07:38.800 --> 07:39.734
COVER OF "MAMBO #5."

07:39.800 --> 07:42.266
"I REMEMBER MY FRIENDS ANGELA,

07:42.333 --> 07:53.967
PAMELA, SANDRA, AND RITA...

07:54.033 --> 07:57.934
AND AS I CONTINUE, YOU KNOW

07:57.967 --> 07:59.500
THEY'RE GETTING SWEETER.

07:59.567 --> 08:05.100
BWAH-BWAH, BWAH-BWAH."

08:05.166 --> 08:06.033
BUT WHEN KAVANAUGH WAS NOT

08:06.100 --> 08:06.667
CHOKING BACK TEARS, HE WAS

08:06.734 --> 08:07.567
NOTICEABLY ANGRY, ARGUING THAT

08:07.633 --> 08:08.367
HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A GIANT

08:08.433 --> 08:10.467
CONSPIRACY.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.800
>> THIS ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED

08:11.867 --> 08:13.033
AND PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER

08:13.100 --> 08:17.667
DR. FORD'S WISHES.

08:17.734 --> 08:20.667
AND THEN -- AND THEN, AS NO

08:20.734 --> 08:24.367
DOUBT WAS EXPECTED, IF NOT

08:24.433 --> 08:27.333
PLANNED, CAME A LONG SERIES OF

08:27.400 --> 08:30.500
FALSE LAST-MINUTE SMEARS

08:30.567 --> 08:33.233
DESIGNED TO SCARE ME AND DRIVE

08:33.300 --> 08:34.700
ME OUT OF THE PROCESS BEFORE ANY

08:34.767 --> 08:38.533
HEARING OCCURRED.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.734
CRAZY STUFF.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.967
GANGS, ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN,

08:41.033 --> 08:42.200
FIGHTS ON BOATS IN

08:42.266 --> 08:44.600
RHODE ISLAND.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.367
>> John: "I MEAN, COME ON!

08:46.433 --> 08:47.500
DO I SEEM LIKE EXACTLY THE TYPE

08:47.567 --> 08:49.834
OF PERSON WHO WOULD GET INTO A

08:49.900 --> 08:51.033
FIGHT ON A BOAT IN RHODE ISLAND?

08:51.100 --> 08:52.033
SERIOUSLY!

08:52.100 --> 08:54.767
YOU TELL ME!

08:54.834 --> 08:56.200
WHEN YOU PICTURE A FIGHT ON A

08:56.266 --> 08:57.100
BOAT IN RHODE ISLAND, DO YOU

08:57.166 --> 08:58.667
JUST PICTURE TWO OF ME YELLING

08:58.734 --> 08:59.800
AT EACH OTHER AT EXACTLY THIS

08:59.867 --> 09:00.934
PITCH AND VOLUME?

09:01.000 --> 09:01.800
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

09:01.867 --> 09:03.333
THAT IF YOU WANTED MY HAIRCUT,

09:03.400 --> 09:04.500
YOU WOULD TELL YOUR BARBER TO

09:04.567 --> 09:05.900
GIVE YOU THE 'FIGHT ON A BOAT IN

09:05.967 --> 09:07.367
RHODE ISLAND?'

09:07.433 --> 09:09.367
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU

09:09.433 --> 09:11.700
SAY THAT TO MY FACE ON A BOAT IN

09:11.767 --> 09:12.333
RHODE ISLAND, AND THAT'S ALL I

09:12.400 --> 09:14.233
HAVE TO SHOUT ABOUT THAT!

09:14.333 --> 09:16.367
FUCK YOU!

09:16.433 --> 09:19.934
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE WATER!"

09:19.967 --> 09:21.633
AND REMEMBER, REMEMBER, WHAT

09:21.700 --> 09:22.934
YOU'VE JUST SEEN WAS HIM READING

09:22.967 --> 09:24.867
FROM A PREPARED STATEMENT.

09:24.934 --> 09:26.500
IT GOT EVEN STRANGER ONCE HE

09:26.567 --> 09:28.200
STARTED TAKING QUESTIONS.

09:28.266 --> 09:29.600
>> DID YOU CONSUME ALCOHOL

09:29.667 --> 09:31.033
DURING YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARS?

09:31.100 --> 09:32.567
>> YES, WE DRANK BEER.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.266
MY FRIENDS AND I.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.166
THE BOYS AND GIRLS.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.333
YES, WE DRANK BEER.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.166
I LIKED BEER.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.734
STILL LIKE BEER.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.166
WE DRANK BEER.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.800
THE DRINKING AGE, AS I NOTED,

09:43.867 --> 09:44.600
WAS 18, SO THE SENIORS WERE

09:44.667 --> 09:45.700
LEGAL.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.700
SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

09:47.767 --> 09:49.200
PEOPLE WERE LEGAL TO DRINK.

09:49.266 --> 09:56.100
AND WE DRANK -- YEAH, WE DRANK

09:56.166 --> 09:57.066
BEER, AND I SAID SOMETIMES --

09:57.133 --> 09:58.066
SOMETIMES PROBABLY HAD TOO MANY

09:58.133 --> 09:59.200
BEERS, AND SOMETIMES OTHER

09:59.266 --> 10:00.066
PEOPLE HAD TOO MANY BEERS.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.033
WE DRANK BEER.

10:01.100 --> 10:01.867
WE LIKED BEER.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.467
>> John: YEAH, I GET THAT.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.300
I DO.

10:06.367 --> 10:08.066
I, UM, I GET THAT LOUD AND

10:08.133 --> 10:09.000
CLEAR, BRETT.

10:09.066 --> 10:16.200
BUT THE QUESTION ISN'T REALLY

10:16.266 --> 10:17.000
"DO YOU LIKE BEER," IS IT?

10:17.066 --> 10:17.934
IT'S HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE IT?

10:18.000 --> 10:18.867
LIKE HOW THE QUESTION IN

10:18.934 --> 10:19.533
JEFFREY DAHMER'S TRIAL WASN'T

10:19.600 --> 10:20.333
"DO YOU LIKE PEOPLE?"

10:20.400 --> 10:21.100
IT WAS, "DO YOU LIKE PEOPLE TO A

10:21.166 --> 10:21.934
PROBLEMATIC EXTENT?"

10:22.000 --> 10:22.734
AND WHEN PRESSED ON HIS

10:22.800 --> 10:23.567
DRINKING, KAVANAUGH BECAME

10:23.633 --> 10:24.433
EITHER DISMISSIVE OR OUTRIGHT

10:24.500 --> 10:27.166
HOSTILE, AND IT WAS AT THOSE

10:27.233 --> 10:27.800
MOMENTS YOU GOT A REAL

10:27.867 --> 10:29.033
SENSE OF WHO THIS MAN ACTUALLY

10:29.100 --> 10:29.734
IS.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.834
>> WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE

10:30.900 --> 10:32.700
TOO MANY BEERS?

10:32.767 --> 10:36.100
>> I DON'T KNOW.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.200
YOU KNOW, WE -- WHATEVER THE

10:37.266 --> 10:38.200
CHART SAYS.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.133
I LIKE BEER.

10:40.233 --> 10:41.233
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.400
>> OKAY.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.233
DO YOU LIKE BEER, SENATOR, OR

10:43.300 --> 10:44.367
NOT?

10:44.433 --> 10:45.233
>> UM, NEXT...

10:45.300 --> 10:46.367
>> WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DRINK?

10:46.433 --> 10:47.133
>> NEXT ONE IS --

10:47.200 --> 10:47.967
>> SENATOR, WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO

10:48.066 --> 10:48.767
DRINK?

10:48.834 --> 10:49.533
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S

10:49.600 --> 10:50.800
NEVER BEEN A CASE WHERE YOU

10:50.867 --> 10:51.400
DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU DIDN'T

10:51.467 --> 10:52.033
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT

10:52.100 --> 10:55.166
BEFORE OR PART OF WHAT HAPPENED?

10:55.233 --> 10:56.266
>> IT'S -- YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT,

10:56.333 --> 10:56.767
YEAH, BLACKOUT.

10:56.834 --> 10:57.600
I DON'T KNOW.

10:57.667 --> 10:58.500
HAVE YOU?

10:58.567 --> 10:59.633
>> CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION,

10:59.700 --> 11:01.967
JUDGE?

11:02.033 --> 11:02.834
I JUST -- SO YOU -- THAT'S NOT

11:02.900 --> 11:03.633
HAPPENED?

11:03.700 --> 11:04.500
IS THAT YOUR ANSWER?

11:04.567 --> 11:06.066
>> YEAH, AND I'M CURIOUS IF YOU

11:06.133 --> 11:08.233
HAVE.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.133
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST, ASIDE

11:10.200 --> 11:12.767
FROM BEING DEEPLY DISRESPECTFUL,

11:12.834 --> 11:14.200
"HAVE YOU?" IS JUST NOT THE

11:14.266 --> 11:15.066
ANSWER OF AN INNOCENT PERSON.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.967
IF YOU ASK SOMEONE IF THEY EVER

11:18.066 --> 11:23.934
BLEW A DOG, AND THEY GO,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.033
"I DON'T KNOW, HAVE YOU?"

11:26.100 --> 11:26.533
THAT PERSON BLEW A DOG.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.800
AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, NOT JUST

11:29.867 --> 11:30.667
ONE EITHER.

11:30.734 --> 11:31.400
AND THAT SURLY TONE WAS

11:31.467 --> 11:32.166
EMBLEMATIC OF KAVANAUGH'S

11:32.233 --> 11:32.867
DEMEANOR THROUGHOUT THE HEARING.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.100
NOT THE TONE OF A MAN WHO HOPES

11:34.166 --> 11:36.233
TO ONE DAY HAVE THE HONOR OF

11:36.300 --> 11:37.033
SERVING ON THE SUPREME COURT,

11:37.100 --> 11:38.900
BUT THE TONE OF SOMEONE WHO

11:38.967 --> 11:41.033
FEELS ENTITLED TO BE ON IT AND

11:41.100 --> 11:43.033
FRANKLY CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE

11:43.100 --> 11:47.567
BEING SUCH A DICK ABOUT THIS,

11:47.633 --> 11:50.700
AND IT ACTUALLY DOES

11:50.767 --> 11:51.467
MAKE SOME SENSE.

11:51.533 --> 11:52.200
BECAUSE THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS

11:52.266 --> 11:52.834
HAD EVERY IMAGINABLE ADVANTAGE.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.033
HIS ELITE HIGH SCHOOL -- AND

11:54.100 --> 11:54.600
THIS IS TRUE -- HAS ITS OWN

11:54.667 --> 11:55.133
NINE-HOLE GOLF COURSE.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.700
NOW, AM I SAYING THAT SOMEONE

11:56.767 --> 11:58.200
WHO WENT TO A SCHOOL WITH ITS

11:58.266 --> 11:59.867
OWN GOLF COURSE SHOULDN'T BE ON

11:59.934 --> 12:00.266
THE SUPREME COURT?

12:00.333 --> 12:01.166
YEAH.

12:01.233 --> 12:02.467
YEAH, I THINK I AM.

12:02.533 --> 12:03.600
I HONESTLY DIDN'T PLAN TO WHEN I

12:03.667 --> 12:04.333
STARTED THAT SENTENCE, BUT HERE

12:04.400 --> 12:05.367
WE ARE, AND I'M GOING TO STAND

12:05.433 --> 12:06.333
BY IT.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.500
BUT KAVANAUGH DIDN'T JUST RELY

12:07.567 --> 12:08.500
ON BELLIGERENCE TO REFUTE FORD'S

12:08.567 --> 12:09.533
CHARGES.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.667
HE BROUGHT EVIDENCE.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.800
SPECIFICALLY, A CALENDAR FROM

12:13.867 --> 12:14.900
1982, ABOUT WHICH HE WAS -- AND

12:14.967 --> 12:15.967
I KNOW THIS WILL SHOCK YOU --

12:16.066 --> 12:17.834
WEIRDLY EMOTIONAL.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.633
>> WHY DID I KEEP CALENDARS?

12:20.700 --> 12:22.233
MY DAD STARTED KEEPING DETAILED

12:22.300 --> 12:37.433
CALENDARS OF HIS LIFE IN 1978.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.967
HE DID SO AS BOTH A CALENDAR AND

12:40.066 --> 12:41.367
A DIARY.

12:41.433 --> 12:42.166
CHRISTMAS TIME, WE'D SIT AROUND

12:42.233 --> 12:45.567
AND HE'D REGALE US WITH OLD

12:45.633 --> 12:47.033
STORIES, OLD MILESTONES, OLD

12:47.100 --> 12:47.967
WEDDINGS, OLD EVENTS FROM HIS

12:48.066 --> 12:54.800
CALENDARS.

12:54.867 --> 12:55.667
>> John: NOW, I KNOW IT MAY SEEM

12:55.734 --> 12:56.367
CRUEL TO MAKE FUN OF A MAN

12:56.433 --> 12:57.200
CRYING OVER HIS LATE FATHER'S

12:57.266 --> 12:58.633
CALENDARS.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.066
BUT WHAT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU

13:00.133 --> 13:01.266
HIS FATHER IS STILL ALIVE AND

13:01.333 --> 13:02.533
WAS SITTING RIGHT BEHIND HIM?

13:02.600 --> 13:04.033
THAT'S HIM.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.567
AND THAT IS WHY I'M NOW

13:05.633 --> 13:07.033
COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE SAYING

13:07.100 --> 13:08.633
THAT "EVERY CHRISTMAS, WE'D

13:08.700 --> 13:09.667
GATHER ROUND AND DAD WOULD

13:09.734 --> 13:10.633
REGALE US WITH OLD EVENTS FROM

13:10.700 --> 13:11.867
HIS CALENDAR" IS THE SINGLE

13:11.934 --> 13:13.967
WEIRDEST FUCKING THING I HAVE

13:14.033 --> 13:16.900
EVER HEARD ANYBODY SAY.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.166
AND TO MAKE IT WEIRDER,

13:18.233 --> 13:20.133
REMEMBER, KAVANAUGH JUST SAID

13:20.200 --> 13:21.567
THAT HIS DAD STARTED KEEPING

13:21.633 --> 13:23.300
CALENDARS IN 1978, WHEN

13:23.367 --> 13:25.000
KAVANAUGH WAS 13.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.633
MEANING HE WOULD'VE BEEN 14 AT

13:26.700 --> 13:27.934
THE TIME HIS DAD HAD EVEN A

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
SINGLE CALENDAR TO READ TO HIS

13:30.066 --> 13:32.500
CHILDREN FROM.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.900
AND AN ADULT MAN READING LAST

13:33.967 --> 13:35.400
YEAR'S CALENDAR TO HIS

13:35.467 --> 13:37.667
14-YEAR-OLD SON IS LITERALLY THE

13:37.734 --> 13:39.300
SADDEST CHRISTMAS I CAN IMAGINE,

13:39.333 --> 13:40.233
OTHER THAN BEING ONE OF THE

13:40.333 --> 13:41.333
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO GETS

13:41.400 --> 13:42.667
MURDERED IN THE MOVIE

13:42.734 --> 13:44.066
"DIE HARD."

13:44.133 --> 13:45.367
THAT IS LITERALLY THE ONLY OTHER

13:45.433 --> 13:47.467
EXAMPLE.

13:47.533 --> 13:48.934
AND THE TRUTH IS, KAVANAUGH'S

13:48.967 --> 13:51.033
CALENDAR MAY NOT HAVE ACTUALLY

13:51.100 --> 13:52.467
HELPED HIM, BECAUSE WHILE HE

13:52.533 --> 13:56.200
TOLD THE PANEL HE NEVER ATTENDED

13:56.266 --> 13:56.967
A GATHERING LIKE THE ONE

13:57.066 --> 13:57.834
DR. FORD DESCRIBES IN HER

13:57.900 --> 13:58.900
ALLEGATION, IN FACT, HIS

13:58.967 --> 14:00.367
CALENDAR SHOWS AT LEAST ONE

14:00.433 --> 14:01.333
SIMILAR EVENT WITH AT LEAST TWO

14:01.400 --> 14:02.500
OF THE PEOPLE FORD NAMED IN HER

14:02.567 --> 14:03.400
LETTER.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.400
AND KAVANAUGH MISREPRESENTING

14:04.467 --> 14:05.867
THE TRUTH ACTUALLY BECAME

14:05.934 --> 14:06.967
SOMETHING OF A REALLY TROUBLING

14:07.033 --> 14:08.233
PATTERN.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.800
FOR INSTANCE, HE REPEATEDLY MADE

14:09.867 --> 14:10.533
THIS STRONG CLAIM TO POKE HOLES

14:10.600 --> 14:14.100
IN FORD'S STORY.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.467
>> I JUST WANT TO REEMPHASIZE,

14:15.533 --> 14:18.033
ALL FOUR WITNESSES WHO WERE

14:18.100 --> 14:19.667
ALLEGEDLY AT THE EVENT HAVE SAID

14:19.734 --> 14:21.967
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, INCLUDING

14:22.033 --> 14:23.200
DR. FORD'S LONGTIME FRIEND

14:23.266 --> 14:25.800
MS. KEYSER.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.734
>> John: EXCEPT THIS 53-YEAR-OLD

14:27.800 --> 14:28.633
FRAT PLEDGE IS ACTUALLY

14:28.700 --> 14:29.834
SIGNIFICANTLY MISSTATING THE

14:29.900 --> 14:32.934
FACTS THERE, BECAUSE IN REALITY,

14:33.000 --> 14:33.800
THREE OF THOSE PEOPLE

14:33.867 --> 14:34.767
MERELY SAID THEY DIDN'T RECALL

14:34.834 --> 14:42.266
THE PARTY AS DESCRIBED.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.667
AND FORD'S FRIEND MS. KEYSER

14:43.734 --> 14:44.300
SPECIFICALLY SAID SHE BELIEVES

14:44.367 --> 14:44.934
FORD'S ALLEGATION.

14:45.000 --> 14:45.967
AND THE FOURTH PERSON IS

14:46.033 --> 14:47.700
KAVANAUGH HIMSELF.

14:47.767 --> 14:48.533
SO HE JUST MISCHARACTERIZED

14:48.600 --> 14:49.266
EVIDENCE.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.433
AND THAT IS ONE THING A JUDGE

14:50.500 --> 14:56.934
REALLY SHOULD KNOW NOT TO DO,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.633
IT'S BASICALLY THAT AND DON'T

14:58.700 --> 15:00.700
TALK YOUR ROPES INTO YOUR

15:00.767 --> 15:01.767
BLUE JEANS.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.100
IT'S OBJECTIVELY A BAD LOOK.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.100
THEN THERE WAS THE FACT THAT,

15:04.166 --> 15:04.934
FOR ALL KAVANAUGH'S TALK OF HIS

15:05.000 --> 15:05.667
WHOLESOME TEENAGE YEARS, SPENT

15:05.734 --> 15:06.533
RESPECTING WOMEN FOR THEIR

15:06.600 --> 15:07.266
FRIENDSHIP AND DOING SICK REPS

15:07.333 --> 15:08.100
IN TOBIN'S DAD'S HOUSE, HIS

15:08.166 --> 15:09.033
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK TELLS A

15:09.100 --> 15:09.867
VERY DIFFERENT STORY.

15:09.934 --> 15:10.834
FOR INSTANCE, HE AND HIS BRO

15:10.900 --> 15:11.600
FRIENDS BRAG ABOUT BEING

15:11.667 --> 15:12.367
"RENATA ALUMNI," REFERRING TO A

15:12.433 --> 15:13.734
GIRL THAT THEY KNEW.

15:13.800 --> 15:14.633
NOW, KAVANAUGH CLAIMS THAT WAS

15:14.700 --> 15:16.066
COMPLETELY ASEXUAL AND JUST

15:16.133 --> 15:17.867
CLUMSILY INTENDED TO SHOW

15:17.934 --> 15:18.967
AFFECTION, AND THAT SHE WAS "ONE

15:19.033 --> 15:20.066
OF US."

15:20.133 --> 15:21.133
WHICH IS A LITTLE HARD TO

15:21.200 --> 15:22.400
BELIEVE, GIVEN THAT, A, RENATA

15:22.467 --> 15:23.900
ONLY JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

15:23.967 --> 15:24.967
AND SAID THE INSINUATION IS

15:25.033 --> 15:26.900
HORRIBLE, HURTFUL, AND SIMPLY

15:26.967 --> 15:29.033
UNTRUE, AND, B, IF IT WAS JUST

15:29.100 --> 15:30.834
AFFECTION FOR A FRIEND,

15:30.900 --> 15:33.633
WHERE'S THE ALUMNI SOCIETY FOR

15:33.700 --> 15:35.834
AMY OR JULIE OR KRISTIN OR KAREN

15:35.900 --> 15:41.800
OR MOIRA?

15:41.867 --> 15:43.767
ESPECIALLY MOIRA.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.467
MOIRA MOST OF ALL.

15:45.533 --> 15:46.333
NOW, KAVANAUGH HAD SIMILARLY

15:46.400 --> 15:46.934
IMPLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR

15:46.967 --> 15:47.700
OTHER TERMS IN THE YEARBOOK,

15:47.767 --> 15:48.633
SPECIFICALLY, THOSE COMMONLY

15:48.700 --> 15:53.467
ASSOCIATED WITH DRINKING OR SEX.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.000
>> HAVE YOU -- I DON'T KNOW IF

15:55.066 --> 15:55.800
IT'S "BOUFED" OR "BOOFED" -- HOW

15:55.867 --> 15:56.700
DO YOU PRONOUNCE THAT?"

15:56.767 --> 15:57.667
>> THAT REFERS TO FLATULENCE.

15:57.734 --> 16:00.200
WE WERE 16.

16:00.266 --> 16:01.600
>> LET'S LOOK AT "BEACH WEEK

16:01.667 --> 16:02.700
RALPH CLUB BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR."

16:02.767 --> 16:03.834
WHAT DOES THE WORD "RALPH" MEAN

16:03.900 --> 16:04.800
IN THAT?

16:04.867 --> 16:06.500
>> THAT PROBABLY REFERS TO

16:06.567 --> 16:07.533
THROWING UP.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
I'M KNOWN TO HAVE A WEAK

16:08.667 --> 16:10.400
STOMACH, AND I ALWAYS HAVE.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.867
>> "DEVIL'S TRIANGLE?"

16:12.934 --> 16:16.934
>> DRINKING GAME.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.266
>> John: BULLSHIT.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.533
THE TERM "DEVIL'S TRIANGLE" IS

16:20.600 --> 16:21.867
COMMONLY KNOWN TO REFER TO A

16:21.934 --> 16:23.467
THREESOME INVOLVING TWO MEN AND

16:23.533 --> 16:25.700
ONE WOMAN.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.533
SO I'M JUST NOT BUYING THAT,

16:27.600 --> 16:28.633
UNLESS ALL YOUR DRINKING GAMES

16:28.700 --> 16:29.834
WERE NAMED AFTER WIDELY

16:29.900 --> 16:31.100
RECOGNIZED SEX ACTS.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.200
OH, "DOGGY STYLE?"

16:32.266 --> 16:33.100
DRINKING GAME.

16:33.133 --> 16:34.333
YOU POUR VODKA IN A BOWL AND

16:34.400 --> 16:35.467
LAP IT UP WHILE WEARING ONLY A

16:35.533 --> 16:38.200
DOG COLLAR.

16:38.266 --> 16:39.400
"FISTING"?

16:39.467 --> 16:40.233
DRINKING GAME.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.200
THAT'S GRIPPING A SHIRAZ IN EACH

16:41.266 --> 16:42.266
FIST AND TOASTING THE PROGRESS

16:42.333 --> 16:44.667
OF FEMINISM.

16:44.734 --> 16:46.300
"69ING"?

16:46.367 --> 16:47.400
ABSOLUTELY DRINKING GAME.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.500
THAT'S LISTENING TO BRYAN ADAMS'

16:48.567 --> 16:49.867
HIT SONG "SUMMER OF '69" WHILE

16:49.934 --> 16:50.967
UNEVENTFULLY DRINKING A BEER ON

16:51.066 --> 16:53.967
THE PORCH.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.633
EVEN C-SPAN CALLERS WERE NOT

16:55.700 --> 16:57.233
BUYING THE DRINKING GAME

16:57.300 --> 16:58.166
DEFENSE.

16:58.233 --> 16:59.567
>> GO AHEAD, CARL.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.333
>> HI.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.967
I JUST WANTED TO ECHO A FEW

17:03.033 --> 17:04.333
THINGS THAT ANOTHER CALLER SAID,

17:04.400 --> 17:05.667
WHICH IS THAT A DEVIL'S TRIANGLE

17:05.734 --> 17:06.333
IS CERTAINLY NOT A DRINKING

17:06.400 --> 17:07.200
GAME.

17:07.266 --> 17:07.967
IT'S AN ENCOUNTER WITH TWO MEN

17:08.066 --> 17:11.633
AND A WOMAN.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.767
>> WE'LL GO NEXT TO MARY IN

17:12.834 --> 17:16.867
BRONXVILLE, NEW YORK.

17:16.934 --> 17:18.734
>> John: I LIKE TO IMAGINE THAT

17:18.800 --> 17:20.333
THAT GUY CALLS IN EVERY DAY TO

17:20.400 --> 17:21.266
DESCRIBE WHAT A DEVIL'S TRIANGLE

17:21.333 --> 17:24.200
IS, AND THAT WAS THE ONLY DAY HE

17:24.266 --> 17:25.633
STOOD EVEN A CHANCE OF GETTING

17:25.700 --> 17:26.166
ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIS

17:26.233 --> 17:27.567
EXPLANATION.

17:27.633 --> 17:28.934
AND, LOOK, WHILE IT MAY SEEM

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
UNBELIEVABLY PETTY TO GIVE THIS

17:30.066 --> 17:31.200
MUCH ATTENTION TO A

17:31.266 --> 17:32.500
HIGH SCHOOLER'S YEARBOOK, YOU

17:32.567 --> 17:34.834
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT TO SOME

17:34.900 --> 17:38.367
EXTENT, MANY WERE WATCHING THIS

17:38.433 --> 17:39.333
HEARING TO TRY AND ASCERTAIN WHO

17:39.400 --> 17:40.800
WAS MORE TRUSTWORTHY.

17:40.867 --> 17:41.934
WAS IT THE TERRIFIED PSYCHOLOGY

17:42.000 --> 17:43.333
PROFESSOR WHO BLEW UP HER ENTIRE

17:43.400 --> 17:44.667
LIFE TO RELIVE HER TRAUMA ON A

17:44.734 --> 17:46.734
NATIONAL STAGE?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.033
OR WAS IT JUDGE ANIMAL HOUSE,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.300
WHO SEEMED TO BE SWEATILY MAKING

17:49.367 --> 17:50.633
UP DRINKING GAMES BEFORE MEMBERS

17:50.700 --> 17:52.166
OF THE SENATE?

17:52.233 --> 17:54.467
AND YET, FOR SOME SENATORS,

17:54.533 --> 17:55.700
KAVANAUGH'S POOR PERFORMANCE WAS

17:55.767 --> 17:56.900
COMPLETELY IMMATERIAL, AS THEY

17:56.967 --> 18:00.100
HAD ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.867
ORRIN HATCH, TAKING A BREAK FROM

18:03.934 --> 18:05.934
BEING "PLEASED," MADE THE BROAD

18:05.967 --> 18:07.433
CASE THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO

18:07.500 --> 18:08.734
EVEN ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT AN

18:08.800 --> 18:10.100
EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE SUCH A

18:10.166 --> 18:12.367
LONG TIME AGO.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.800
>> THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE,

18:15.867 --> 18:16.800
THE WAY YOU'RE BEING TREATED.

18:16.867 --> 18:17.867
THERE'S BEEN NO WHISPER OF

18:17.934 --> 18:19.266
MISCONDUCT BY HIM IN THE TIME

18:19.333 --> 18:21.100
HE'S BEEN A JUDGE.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.967
WHAT WE HAVE ARE UNCORROBORATED,

18:23.033 --> 18:25.867
UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS FROM

18:25.934 --> 18:26.834
HIS...

18:27.900 --> 18:29.967
TEENAGE YEARS!

18:30.033 --> 18:30.967
>> John: THAT IS CLEARLY A

18:31.033 --> 18:31.967
SHITTY, DISINGENUOUS ARGUMENT,

18:32.066 --> 18:33.633
THOUGH I WILL GIVE HATCH CREDIT

18:33.700 --> 18:34.300
FOR INVOKING THE PHRASE

18:34.367 --> 18:36.166
"TEENAGE YEARS" WITH THE VOICE

18:36.233 --> 18:37.166
OF A 13-YEAR-OLD WHOSE BALLS ARE

18:37.233 --> 18:39.900
LITERALLY DROPPING MID-SENTENCE.

18:39.967 --> 18:41.033
NOW, AS FOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, HE

18:41.100 --> 18:43.200
TURNED HIS PERFORMATIVE DISGUST

18:43.266 --> 18:45.100
AT THE PROCESS UP TO 10.

18:45.166 --> 18:49.200
>> THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL

18:49.266 --> 18:51.100
SHAM SINCE I'VE BEEN IN

18:51.166 --> 18:53.700
POLITICS.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.567
AND IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW

18:55.633 --> 18:57.266
THE TRUTH, YOU SURE AS HELL

18:57.333 --> 18:58.300
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'VE

18:58.367 --> 18:59.734
DONE TO THIS GUY.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.467
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FAIR

19:00.533 --> 19:01.467
PROCESS?

19:01.533 --> 19:03.300
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT

19:03.367 --> 19:06.166
THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND.

19:06.233 --> 19:07.100
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

19:07.166 --> 19:10.934
LINDSAY GRAHAM SOUNDS LIKE THE

19:11.000 --> 19:12.100
LEAST INTIMIDATING SHERIFF IN

19:12.166 --> 19:13.166
THE ENTIRE WILD WEST.

19:13.233 --> 19:14.333
"YOU TURN AROUND AND GET BACK ON

19:14.400 --> 19:15.767
YOUR HORSE, MR. MAN, BECAUSE

19:15.834 --> 19:16.734
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE

19:16.800 --> 19:17.600
SOFT, TENDER LITTLE BABYFACE OF

19:17.667 --> 19:19.567
JUSTICE.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.133
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT

19:21.200 --> 19:27.767
THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.200
THE WRONG TIME.

19:30.266 --> 19:35.467
PEW-PEW-PEW!

19:35.533 --> 19:36.967
JUSTICE!

19:37.033 --> 19:38.900
BABYFACE.

19:38.967 --> 19:39.934
RIDE."

19:39.967 --> 19:40.900
BUT SECOND, LINDSEY GRAHAM IS

19:40.967 --> 19:41.934
NOT WRONG.

19:41.967 --> 19:42.600
HE LOOKS LIKE A DOLL THAT'S NOT

19:42.667 --> 19:43.467
ALLOWED TO BE WITHIN 50 FEET OF

19:43.533 --> 19:44.333
A PLAYGROUND, BUT HE'S NOT

19:44.400 --> 19:44.934
TECHNICALLY WRONG.

19:44.967 --> 19:45.867
THIS PROCESS WAS DEEPLY FLAWED,

19:45.934 --> 19:46.867
BUT THAT IS BECAUSE HE AND THE

19:46.934 --> 19:47.900
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY DESIGNED IT

19:47.967 --> 19:48.967
THAT WAY.

19:49.066 --> 19:50.033
IF THEY WANTED TO AVOID A

19:50.100 --> 19:51.100
"HE SAID, SHE SAID" SITUATION,

19:51.166 --> 19:52.133
THEY ABSOLUTELY COULD HAVE.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.533
BUT INSTEAD THEY ONLY CALLED TWO

19:53.600 --> 19:54.734
PEOPLE, SO WE ONLY HEARD WHAT HE

19:54.800 --> 19:56.667
SAID AND WHAT SHE SAID.

19:56.734 --> 19:58.266
A MUCH FAIRER PROCESS WOULD HAVE

19:58.333 --> 20:01.433
INVOLVED GATHERING EVIDENCE AND

20:01.500 --> 20:03.300
HEARING FROM OTHERS, LIKE

20:03.367 --> 20:04.500
KAVANAUGH'S CLASSMATES, IN

20:04.567 --> 20:05.600
PARTICULAR, HIS HIGH SCHOOL

20:05.667 --> 20:06.834
FRIEND MARK JUDGE, WHO FORD SAYS

20:06.900 --> 20:07.900
WAS IN THE ROOM DURING THE

20:07.967 --> 20:11.266
ALLEGED ASSAULT.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.266
BUT THAT IS NOT HOW REPUBLICANS

20:12.333 --> 20:13.133
CHOSE TO SET UP THE HEARING.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.233
AND FOR ALL KAVANAUGH'S

20:14.300 --> 20:15.200
EMOTIONAL APPEALS ABOUT WANTING

20:15.266 --> 20:16.166
HIS NAME CLEARED, HE WAS

20:16.233 --> 20:17.400
REPEATEDLY ASKED ABOUT WHETHER

20:17.467 --> 20:18.533
HE SUPPORTED AN FBI

20:18.600 --> 20:19.734
INVESTIGATION AND CONSISTENTLY

20:19.800 --> 20:21.700
DODGED THE QUESTION.

20:21.767 --> 20:23.400
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WILL YOU

20:23.467 --> 20:24.367
SUPPORT AN FBI INVESTIGATION...

20:24.433 --> 20:25.266
>> I'LL DO -- I'LL --

20:25.333 --> 20:28.166
>> RIGHT NOW?

20:28.233 --> 20:33.133
>> I WILL DO WHATEVER THE

20:33.200 --> 20:33.867
COMMITTEE WANTS TO.

20:33.934 --> 20:34.734
>> PERSONALLY, DO YOU THINK

20:34.800 --> 20:35.834
THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR US TO

20:35.900 --> 20:38.033
DO?

20:38.100 --> 20:43.567
YOU WON'T ANSWER?

20:43.633 --> 20:45.200
>> LOOK, SENATOR, I'VE --

20:45.266 --> 20:46.600
I'VE -- I'VE SAID I WANTED A

20:46.667 --> 20:47.900
HEARING, AND I'D SAID I WOULD

20:47.967 --> 20:48.800
WELCOME ANYTHING.

20:48.867 --> 20:49.633
>> John: YOU'LL "WELCOME

20:49.700 --> 20:51.934
ANYTHING?"

20:52.000 --> 20:52.700
JUST SAY YOU WILL SUPPORT AN

20:52.767 --> 20:53.367
INVESTIGATION.

20:53.433 --> 20:57.367
YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF A HEINOUS

20:57.433 --> 20:58.700
CRIME THAT YOU INSIST YOU DID

20:58.767 --> 20:59.700
NOT COMMIT.

20:59.767 --> 21:00.467
IF I WERE KAVANAUGH, I'D BE

21:00.533 --> 21:01.233
DESPERATELY TRYING TO PROVE MY

21:01.300 --> 21:02.033
INNOCENCE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY:

21:02.100 --> 21:03.133
FBI INVESTIGATIONS, POLYGRAPH

21:03.200 --> 21:04.900
TESTS, SWORN AFFIDAVITS FROM NOT

21:04.967 --> 21:06.934
ONLY MARK JUDGE BUT ALSO ALL MY

21:06.967 --> 21:08.967
OTHER BOYS FROM G-TOWN PREP:

21:09.033 --> 21:11.300
I'M TALKING ABOUT TOBIN, TIMMY,

21:11.367 --> 21:13.433
SQUI, P.J., CUMRUG, TOOKS, MERC,

21:13.500 --> 21:16.166
C-DUBS, DIRTY PETE, FAT ANDY,

21:16.233 --> 21:17.600
SPLIFFORD THE HOMEDAWG,

21:17.667 --> 21:18.867
BONERWITZ, BONERWITZ'S OLDER

21:18.934 --> 21:23.500
BROTHER J-MONEY, AND SHIT DICK.

21:23.567 --> 21:24.500
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,

21:24.567 --> 21:29.467
CHARACTER WITNESSES.

21:29.533 --> 21:30.900
AND AT THIS POINT, LET'S

21:30.967 --> 21:32.834
ACTUALLY PULL BACK AND LOOK AT

21:32.900 --> 21:34.133
THE PICTURE OF KAVANAUGH'S

21:34.200 --> 21:35.700
CHARACTER THAT WE NOW HAVE,

21:35.767 --> 21:36.934
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK

21:36.967 --> 21:38.233
HE'S GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR

21:38.300 --> 21:39.667
EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S

21:39.734 --> 21:41.000
IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER IT IS

21:41.066 --> 21:41.934
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IN HIS...

21:43.400 --> 21:44.233
"TEENAGE YEARS" --

21:44.300 --> 21:45.266
EVEN THEN, THERE SHOULD BE

21:45.333 --> 21:46.200
PLENTY IN WHAT WE SAW THIS WEEK

21:46.266 --> 21:47.600
TO CAUSE YOU REAL CONCERN,

21:47.667 --> 21:49.567
BECAUSE A KEY PART OF HIS FUTURE

21:49.633 --> 21:50.734
JOB IS JUDGMENT AND TEMPERAMENT.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.066
AND THIS WEEK, HE TALKED OVER

21:53.133 --> 21:55.266
THE TOP OF SENATORS, DODGED

21:55.333 --> 21:57.166
QUESTIONS, AND CONFLATED

21:57.233 --> 21:58.000
"DOESN'T RECALL SOMETHING

21:58.066 --> 21:59.000
HAPPENING" WITH "DENIES

21:59.066 --> 22:00.066
SOMETHING HAPPENED," WHICH IS,

22:00.133 --> 22:01.200
AGAIN, A FUCKING IMPORTANT

22:01.266 --> 22:02.567
DISTINCTION FOR A JUDGE.

22:02.633 --> 22:03.633
NOT TO MENTION, HE REPEATEDLY

22:03.700 --> 22:04.967
WEPT AT THE CONCEPT OF

22:05.033 --> 22:08.100
CALENDARS.

22:08.166 --> 22:08.967
AND THERE WAS ONE MORE IMPORTANT

22:09.033 --> 22:10.667
MOMENT THAT I WOULD ARGUE IS

22:10.734 --> 22:12.166
DISQUALIFYING IN AND OF ITSELF,

22:12.266 --> 22:13.400
BECAUSE IDEALLY, A SUPREME COURT

22:13.467 --> 22:14.767
JUSTICE SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS

22:14.834 --> 22:16.867
INDEPENDENT OF POLITICS.

22:16.934 --> 22:18.333
KAVANAUGH HIMSELF HAS STATED

22:18.400 --> 22:19.467
THE COURT MUST NEVER BE VIEWED

22:19.533 --> 22:24.467
AS A PARTISAN INSTITUTION.

22:24.533 --> 22:25.867
AND HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

22:25.934 --> 22:27.333
AND YET, IN HIS OPENING

22:27.400 --> 22:28.900
STATEMENT, A DOCUMENT HE HAD

22:28.967 --> 22:30.266
TIME TO DRAFT AND CONSIDER, HIS

22:30.333 --> 22:32.567
TONE WAS POSITIVELY TRUMPIAN.

22:32.633 --> 22:34.300
>> THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT

22:34.367 --> 22:36.200
HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND

22:36.266 --> 22:39.467
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT

22:39.533 --> 22:41.333
FUELED WITH APPARENT PENT-UP

22:41.400 --> 22:43.300
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

22:43.367 --> 22:47.367
THE 2016 ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS

22:47.433 --> 22:49.133
BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY

22:49.200 --> 22:50.667
JUDICIAL RECORD, REVENGE ON

22:50.734 --> 22:53.667
BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS, AND

22:53.734 --> 22:55.900
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MONEY

22:55.967 --> 22:57.367
FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING

22:57.433 --> 23:01.500
OPPOSITION GROUPS.

23:01.567 --> 23:02.467
>> John: NOW, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

23:02.533 --> 23:05.400
HORRIFYING.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.333
AND IT IS WORTH TAKING A MOMENT

23:06.400 --> 23:07.700
TO NOTE THE NORM THAT HAS JUST

23:07.767 --> 23:08.567
BEEN SHATTERED, BECAUSE I KNOW

23:08.633 --> 23:09.467
WE'RE ALL BASICALLY CALLUSED TO

23:09.533 --> 23:11.967
PEOPLE TALKING THAT WAY NOW, BUT

23:12.033 --> 23:12.900
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AT LEAST

23:12.967 --> 23:14.266
NINE PEOPLE LEFT IN AMERICA WHO

23:14.333 --> 23:15.867
DO NOT TALK THAT WAY, AND YET,

23:15.934 --> 23:17.266
KAVANAUGH JUST ALL BUT CAME OUT

23:17.333 --> 23:18.433
AND SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO

23:18.500 --> 23:20.266
APPROACH HIS ENTIRE TENURE AS

23:20.333 --> 23:22.100
ONE GIANT CASE OF "ME VERSUS

23:22.166 --> 23:24.133
THE FUCKING LIBTARD CUCKS."

23:24.200 --> 23:26.233
AND THIS BRINGS ME TO THE MOST

23:26.300 --> 23:27.900
BASIC QUESTION THAT REMAINS:

23:27.967 --> 23:29.300
WHY?

23:29.367 --> 23:31.900
WHY THIS PARTICULAR ASSHOLE?

23:31.967 --> 23:33.133
WHY IS HE THE HILL THAT

23:33.200 --> 23:35.367
CONSERVATIVES ARE WILLING TO DIE

23:35.433 --> 23:36.834
ON?

23:36.900 --> 23:39.233
AND I DO KNOW THAT, FOR SOME OF

23:39.300 --> 23:40.800
KAVANAUGH'S MOST ARDENT

23:40.867 --> 23:42.133
SUPPORTERS, THIS IS A PURELY

23:42.200 --> 23:43.133
IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.100
SENATORS MAY NOT SAY IT ALOUD,

23:44.166 --> 23:45.066
BUT THIS WOMAN FOR KAVANAUGH

23:45.133 --> 23:46.266
DID.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.100
>> I'M HOPING HE GETS IN

23:48.166 --> 23:48.834
PERSONALLY BECAUSE I WANT

23:48.900 --> 24:01.533
ABORTION TO STOP.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.533
EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT HE'S

24:02.600 --> 24:03.367
GUILTY, I THINK I'M

24:03.433 --> 24:04.066
STILL GONNA SUPPORT HIM AND I

24:04.133 --> 24:04.734
HOPE HE GETS IN, 'CAUSE THIS

24:04.800 --> 24:05.467
COULD BE A GOOD CHANCE TO

24:05.533 --> 24:06.166
OVERTURN ABORTION.

24:06.233 --> 24:06.834
>> John: OKAY, IT'S FINE TO

24:06.900 --> 24:07.567
APPOINT SOMEONE WHO'S COMMITTED

24:07.633 --> 24:08.400
SEXUAL ASSAULT TO THE

24:08.467 --> 24:09.133
SUPREME COURT AS LONG AS THEY'LL

24:09.200 --> 24:09.967
CURTAIL ABORTION RIGHTS.

24:10.066 --> 24:10.934
IT'S A STANCE THAT PRIORITIZES

24:10.967 --> 24:12.333
HUMAN LIVES, AS LONG AS YOU

24:12.400 --> 24:13.700
THINK LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION,

24:13.767 --> 24:14.300
STOPS RIGHT BEFORE A SEXUAL

24:14.367 --> 24:15.633
ASSAULT, AND THEN STARTS BACK UP

24:15.700 --> 24:17.467
AGAIN AS SOON AS THE SEXUAL

24:17.533 --> 24:19.100
ASSAULT IS OVER.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.500
NOW, OBVIOUSLY -- OBVIOUSLY, I

24:20.567 --> 24:21.700
PERSONALLY DON'T AGREE WITH

24:21.767 --> 24:25.367
THAT.

24:25.433 --> 24:28.400
BUT EVEN IF ENDING LEGAL

24:28.467 --> 24:29.967
ABORTION IS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL,

24:30.066 --> 24:31.333
THERE ARE MANY CONSERVATIVE

24:31.400 --> 24:32.700
JUDGES WHO COULD DELIVER THAT TO

24:32.767 --> 24:33.533
YOU WITHOUT ALL OF KAVANAUGH'S

24:33.600 --> 24:34.333
ISSUES.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.900
BECAUSE PURELY AS A JUDGE,

24:35.967 --> 24:36.467
THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT

24:36.533 --> 24:36.967
KAVANAUGH.

24:37.033 --> 24:40.633
NOTHING.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.834
HE IS NOT UNIQUELY QUALIFIED.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.233
TRUMP REPORTEDLY PICKED HIM FROM

24:44.300 --> 24:44.834
A LIST OF 25 NAMES PROVIDED BY

24:44.900 --> 24:46.433
OUTSIDE GROUPS LIKE THE

24:46.500 --> 24:47.700
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

24:47.767 --> 24:48.900
EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT HE HAD NO

24:48.967 --> 24:49.767
PREFERENCE REGARDING THE LIST.

24:49.834 --> 24:51.400
>> IS THERE A LEADING CONTENDER

24:51.467 --> 24:52.400
FOR YOU?

24:52.467 --> 24:56.967
>> NO, THERE'S NOT.

24:57.033 --> 24:58.333
>> REALLY NOT?

24:58.400 --> 24:59.533
>> THE LIST IS REALLY GOOD.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.467
>> THEY'RE NOT IN ORDER?

25:00.533 --> 25:01.100
>> NO, NO, YOU CAN THROW A DART

25:01.166 --> 25:02.600
AT THAT LIST, AND IN MY VIEW,

25:02.667 --> 25:03.033
YOU'D BE FINE.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.400
>> John: WOW.

25:04.467 --> 25:05.700
HE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION ABOUT

25:05.767 --> 25:06.967
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES LIKE HE

25:07.033 --> 25:07.867
WAS JUST ASKED WHICH PICKLE IN A

25:07.934 --> 25:09.266
JAR IS HIS FAVORITE PICKLE.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.233
"I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.433
THEY'RE ALL PICKLES.

25:13.500 --> 25:14.867
IT'S A PICKLE JAR, SO IF IT'S IN

25:14.934 --> 25:20.400
THIS JAR, IT'S A PICKLE."

25:20.467 --> 25:22.233
BUT, FOR SOME REASON, THE

25:22.300 --> 25:24.333
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
CONTINUING TO PUSH KAVANAUGH

25:25.467 --> 25:26.100
HARD.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.967
IN FACT, ON FRIDAY,

25:28.066 --> 25:29.300
LINDSEY GRAHAM SEEMED TO VIEW

25:29.367 --> 25:32.066
KAVANAUGH WITH EVEN MORE RELISH.

25:32.133 --> 25:33.367
>> I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER ABOUT

25:33.433 --> 25:34.166
HIM BEING ON THE BENCH THAN I DO

25:34.233 --> 25:35.467
RIGHT NOW.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.867
>> John: REALLY?

25:36.934 --> 25:38.066
YOU FEEL BETTER NOW THAN BEFORE

25:38.133 --> 25:42.667
KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED?

25:42.734 --> 25:44.667
DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT, OR ARE

25:44.734 --> 25:45.967
YOU AFRAID THAT IF YOU DON'T SAY

25:46.033 --> 25:47.533
IT, KAVANAUGH WILL CHALLENGE YOU

25:47.600 --> 25:48.633
TO A FIGHT ON A BOAT IN

25:48.700 --> 25:49.467
RHODE ISLAND?

25:49.533 --> 25:50.633
BECAUSE I DO GET THAT.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.734
HE SEEMS LIKE THE TYPE.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.166
THE POINT IS, AFTER ALL OF THIS,

25:54.233 --> 25:56.533
I GENUINELY CAN NOT SEE A SINGLE

25:56.600 --> 25:58.467
GOOD REASON FOR PUSHING

25:58.533 --> 25:59.600
KAVANAUGH OVER A REPLACEMENT

25:59.667 --> 26:01.800
CANDIDATE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW DEEP

26:01.867 --> 26:03.333
DOWN ANY JUDGE THEY CHOOSE IS

26:03.400 --> 26:05.166
GOING TO RESTRICT ABORTION

26:05.233 --> 26:07.166
RIGHTS.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.633
YOU DON'T NEED TO CHOOSE AN

26:09.700 --> 26:10.834
UNHINGED PARTISAN WITH MULTIPLE

26:10.900 --> 26:12.000
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

26:12.066 --> 26:13.700
HANGING OVER HIM.

26:13.767 --> 26:14.867
SO IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE DOING

26:14.934 --> 26:16.266
THIS JUST TO DELIVER A

26:16.333 --> 26:17.633
"FUCK YOU" TO DEMOCRATS AND EVEN

26:17.700 --> 26:18.867
MORE DIRECTLY, A "FUCK YOU" TO

26:18.934 --> 26:22.767
WOMEN.

26:22.834 --> 26:24.233
BECAUSE WHEN THIS WEEK BEGAN,

26:24.300 --> 26:25.533
THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR MANY WAS

26:25.600 --> 26:26.800
THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD NOT

26:26.867 --> 26:28.667
BELIEVE CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.

26:28.734 --> 26:30.900
BUT BY THE TIME WEEK ENDED, IT

26:30.967 --> 26:31.767
SEEMED SOMETHING DARKER HAD

26:31.834 --> 26:34.133
HAPPENED.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.800
IT SEEMED THEIR RESPONSE WAS,

26:35.867 --> 26:36.834
"OH, WE BELIEVE YOU.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.633
WE JUST DON'T CARE."

26:38.700 --> 26:39.767
AND THE TRAGIC THING IS, SHE

26:39.834 --> 26:41.000
KNEW THIS WAS A POSSIBILITY.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.333
SHE SAID SO EXPLICITLY DURING

26:42.400 --> 26:44.967
HER TESTIMONY.

26:45.033 --> 26:46.767
>> ONCE HE WAS SELECTED AND IT

26:46.834 --> 26:48.767
SEEMED LIKE HE WAS POPULAR AND

26:48.834 --> 26:50.200
IT WAS A SURE VOTE, I WAS

26:50.266 --> 26:53.233
CALCULATING DAILY THE

26:53.266 --> 26:56.133
RISK/BENEFIT FOR ME OF COMING

26:56.200 --> 26:58.567
FORWARD AND WONDERING WHETHER I

26:58.633 --> 27:00.600
WOULD JUST BE JUMPING IN FRONT

27:00.667 --> 27:01.867
OF A TRAIN THAT WAS HEADED TO

27:01.934 --> 27:03.233
WHERE IT WAS HEADED ANYWAY AND

27:03.300 --> 27:05.166
THAT I WOULD JUST BE PERSONALLY

27:05.233 --> 27:08.834
ANNIHILATED.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.200
>> John: SHE KNEW PUBLICLY

27:10.266 --> 27:11.500
RELIVING THE MOST TRAUMATIC

27:11.567 --> 27:12.667
EVENT OF HER LIFE COULD HAVE

27:12.734 --> 27:14.100
ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT ON

27:14.166 --> 27:15.567
ANYTHING, AND YET SHE SPOKE UP

27:15.633 --> 27:16.967
ANYWAY.

27:17.033 --> 27:21.767
IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THE

27:21.834 --> 27:23.200
LENGTHS THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL GO

27:23.266 --> 27:25.900
TO FOR A FREE POLYGRAPH TEST.

27:25.967 --> 27:27.133
AND, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK --

27:27.200 --> 27:28.166
HERE'S THE THING.

27:28.233 --> 27:29.967
HERE'S THE THING.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.600
I AM NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS A

27:32.667 --> 27:33.600
DONE DEAL JUST YET.

27:33.667 --> 27:34.967
THEY WERE DESPERATELY PUSHING

27:35.066 --> 27:36.567
KAVANAUGH THROUGH ON FRIDAY,

27:36.633 --> 27:37.533
ONLY FOR EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE

27:37.600 --> 27:39.166
TO FORCE THE REOPENING OF THE

27:39.233 --> 27:41.333
FBI INVESTIGATION, WHICH, BY THE

27:41.400 --> 27:42.467
WAY, MAY WELL END UP BEING SO

27:42.533 --> 27:43.500
LIMITED AS TO BE ESSENTIALLY

27:43.567 --> 27:45.066
POINTLESS.

27:45.133 --> 27:46.400
BUT THE FACT IS, ONLY CONTINUED

27:46.467 --> 27:48.300
PRESSURE HAS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST

27:48.367 --> 27:50.133
CHANCE OF STOPPING KAVANAUGH'S

27:50.200 --> 27:51.700
CONFIRMATION.

27:51.767 --> 27:53.233
AND IF HE DOES, AS SEEMS

27:53.300 --> 27:54.767
INCREASINGLY LIKELY, MAKE HIS

27:54.834 --> 27:56.233
WAY TO THE COURT, WE SHOULD

27:56.300 --> 27:57.533
NEVER FORGET HOW THAT HAPPENED

27:57.600 --> 28:00.500
OR WHAT HE REPRESENTS.

28:00.567 --> 28:01.533
WE CERTAINLY WILL NOT FORGET IT

28:01.600 --> 28:02.800
ON THIS SHOW.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.333
YOU MAY KNOW THAT, FOR YEARS,

28:04.400 --> 28:06.200
WE'VE HAD AN ALL-DOG SUPREME

28:06.266 --> 28:07.100
COURT WITH DOGS PLAYING THE

28:07.166 --> 28:08.800
JUSTICES, FROM SAMUEL ALITO TO

28:08.867 --> 28:11.166
RUTH BADER GINSBURG.

28:11.233 --> 28:11.934
RIGHT.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.700
GOOD DOG.

28:12.767 --> 28:13.700
GOOD DOG.

28:13.767 --> 28:15.834
DON'T DIE.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.066
GOOD DOG.

28:17.133 --> 28:18.900
GOOD DOG.

28:18.967 --> 28:22.333
SIT, SIT, AND DON'T DIE.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.567
NOW, SINCE 2017, IT'S ACTUALLY

28:24.633 --> 28:26.667
BEEN A MOSTLY DOG SUPREME COURT,

28:26.734 --> 28:28.233
BECAUSE NEIL GORSUCH IS

28:28.300 --> 28:30.700
REPRESENTED ON IT BY A LOBSTER.

28:30.767 --> 28:31.633
THAT'S BECAUSE HIS SEAT WAS

28:31.700 --> 28:32.533
STOLEN FROM MERRICK GARLAND.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.934
THEREFORE, LIKE A LOBSTER, HE

28:35.967 --> 28:38.600
DOES NOT BELONG THERE.

28:38.667 --> 28:39.533
BUT, KAVANAUGH, IF HE'S SEATED,

28:39.600 --> 28:40.367
DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE THAT

28:40.433 --> 28:41.967
TREATMENT.

28:42.066 --> 28:42.533
HE DESERVES SOMETHING THAT

28:42.600 --> 28:43.166
CONSTANTLY REMINDS PEOPLE WHO HE

28:43.233 --> 28:44.867
IS: SOMETHING HOSTILE,

28:44.934 --> 28:46.100
CONSISTENTLY UNSETTLING,

28:46.166 --> 28:47.767
TEMPERAMENTALLY UNPLEASANT, AND

28:47.834 --> 28:49.066
THAT SCREAMS "WHO THE FUCK

28:49.133 --> 28:52.900
ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN?"

28:52.967 --> 28:55.533
SO I PRAY THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE

28:55.600 --> 28:56.867
TO USE THIS, BUT IF WE DO, I SEE

28:56.934 --> 28:57.734
NONE MORE FITTING EMBODIMENT OF

28:57.800 --> 28:58.800
KAVANAUGH THAN THIS:

28:58.867 --> 29:02.233
♪ ♪

29:02.300 --> 29:05.066
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

29:05.133 --> 29:06.600
JUST AS THE ACTUAL SUPREME COURT

29:06.667 --> 29:08.800
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH

29:08.867 --> 29:10.133
KAVANAUGH, OUR ANIMAL

29:10.200 --> 29:11.834
SUPREME COURT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

29:11.900 --> 29:13.500
DEAL WITH THIS MUTATED

29:13.567 --> 29:14.834
CARPET SWATCH THAT APPEARS TO BE

29:14.900 --> 29:17.400
TWEAKING ON BATH SALTS.

29:17.467 --> 29:18.700
I TRULY HOPE IT DOES NOT COME TO

29:18.767 --> 29:20.000
THIS.

29:20.066 --> 29:21.934
AND, LOOK, THERE IS STILL A

29:22.000 --> 29:23.166
CHANCE THAT WE CAN STOP IT.

29:23.233 --> 29:24.300
SO PLEASE CALL YOUR SENATORS

29:24.367 --> 29:25.567
TOMORROW AND TELL THEM YOU DO

29:25.633 --> 29:27.200
NOT WANT TO BE LOOKING AT THIS

29:27.266 --> 29:29.500
FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.834
GET OFF THE BENCH!

29:31.900 --> 29:37.033
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CONFIRMED YET!

29:37.100 --> 29:41.133
NO, I DON'T WANT A BEER!

29:41.200 --> 29:41.767
