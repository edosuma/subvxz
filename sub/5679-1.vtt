01:41.263 --> 01:45.290
Help me! Somebody help!

01:47.436 --> 01:50.928
Somebody, help!

01:52.841 --> 01:54.741
Help me!

02:45.394 --> 02:46.452
Gin!

02:47.596 --> 02:49.154
Read them and weep.

02:49.264 --> 02:50.492
Finally!

02:51.733 --> 02:54.201
- All right.
- You ready?

02:54.369 --> 02:56.200
- War.
- War?

02:56.338 --> 02:57.737
We're not playing war.
War's not even a game.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.205
- We are too playing war. Come on.
- It's total chance, Stace.

03:00.342 --> 03:02.970
Winner picks the game, Jeff.
That's your rules.

03:03.078 --> 03:04.909
Thank you, Amy.

03:05.046 --> 03:07.037
Okay. War.

03:07.182 --> 03:09.548
Okay. Who wants
a little Mexican hair of the dog?

03:09.684 --> 03:11.208
<i>Se√±orita</i> Margarita.

03:11.353 --> 03:13.253
- I'll have some.
- You'll definitely have some.

03:13.388 --> 03:15.413
- Come on, Jeff.
- No, keep that away from me.

03:15.557 --> 03:17.855
Well, that's not what you were saying
last night.

03:17.959 --> 03:21.725
Seriously, Mr. Nude Lifeguard.
What was up with that?

03:22.798 --> 03:24.595
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.667
One, two, three, four, I declare war.

03:26.768 --> 03:28.201
You're burning up, honey.

03:28.303 --> 03:30.271
- What do you mean?
- You're all red.

03:30.405 --> 03:32.703
- No, I'm flushed. I'm just hot.
- You're not flushed.

03:32.808 --> 03:33.866
- I finally won.
- Good.

03:33.975 --> 03:36.375
- I knew you would.
- You did?

03:36.478 --> 03:38.673
- Okay.
- I did. Of course I did.

03:41.082 --> 03:42.777
- Shit!
- What?

03:44.319 --> 03:46.879
I lost my earring.

03:46.988 --> 03:48.421
Why don't you look
under the towel there?

03:48.557 --> 03:49.581
Is it under your chair?

03:49.724 --> 03:50.952
- Look under your towel.
- It's not.

03:51.092 --> 03:53.560
- Under your towel.
- Why would it be under our towel?

03:53.662 --> 03:56.426
- I don't know, I think I was...
- Did you come lay under here?

03:56.565 --> 04:00.365
- We're gonna find it, honey.
- It's my favorite earring.

04:00.469 --> 04:02.460
It's probably in the pool.

04:08.510 --> 04:12.810
I found it. It's yours, I think.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.245
Yeah?

04:14.349 --> 04:17.079
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you.

04:17.185 --> 04:18.880
It's not a problem.

04:18.987 --> 04:21.547
Hey, do you want a drink?

04:22.958 --> 04:25.153
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

04:26.428 --> 04:27.656
It's got ice in it.

04:27.796 --> 04:29.263
It's okay.

04:29.364 --> 04:30.388
It's blended.

04:30.499 --> 04:32.126
- That means it has ice, Eric.
- Thank you.

04:32.267 --> 04:35.100
- Where are you from?
- Munich, originally.

04:35.203 --> 04:36.795
Stace, it's just ice.

04:36.938 --> 04:40.305
No, it's not. The water system here
is contaminated with human feces.

04:40.442 --> 04:43.843
Okay? So your drinks are, like, blended
with hepatitis B. Yes. Hepatitis B.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.810
How do you know each other?

04:45.947 --> 04:49.439
They're best friends,
and we're their boyfriends.

04:49.551 --> 04:50.677
Cool.

04:50.819 --> 04:53.845
How about you?
Are you here by yourself?

04:53.989 --> 04:57.755
No, with my brother,
but he left with some girl, yeah.

04:57.859 --> 05:00.350
Left here? Mexico or...

05:00.495 --> 05:04.955
Oh, no, no. She's an archaeologist.
He went with her to a dig site.

05:05.066 --> 05:07.364
- And what are they digging?
- Like an excavation?

05:07.502 --> 05:10.164
Yeah, it's ruins, I think. A Mayan temple.

05:10.272 --> 05:11.637
Kind of like the ones

05:11.740 --> 05:13.970
- that nobody here wanted to go to...
- Yes, Jeff.

05:14.075 --> 05:15.702
...the entire time that we've been here.

05:15.844 --> 05:18.904
Apparently, it's not even
in the guidebooks.

05:19.047 --> 05:20.571
VIP only.

05:20.715 --> 05:22.546
Yeah. See, Jeff,
that's something I would do.

05:22.684 --> 05:24.549
- Oh, yeah?
- Sounds like fun.

05:24.686 --> 05:27.154
Well, if you're interested,
I'm going there tomorrow.

05:27.255 --> 05:29.223
Heinrich was supposed to be
back by now,

05:29.357 --> 05:31.917
but he must be having a good time.

05:34.729 --> 05:38.563
So what do you guys think?

05:38.700 --> 05:42.067
Ancient Mayan temple
off the beaten path?

05:42.203 --> 05:45.195
I don't know,
a little culture before we leave?

05:48.043 --> 05:49.067
I wanna go.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.235
- You will?
- Yeah.

05:51.379 --> 05:54.280
Since I just kicked Jeff's ass in cards,
I got nothing left to do here.

05:54.416 --> 05:55.405
Wow!

05:56.384 --> 05:57.408
Wow.

05:57.552 --> 05:58.883
- Wow.
- Say something.

05:58.987 --> 06:00.079
Eric?

06:00.221 --> 06:04.351
Well, yeah, I mean, as long as I'm back
for make-your-own-taco night, I'm in.

06:08.463 --> 06:09.623
Amy?

06:16.171 --> 06:17.968
Do we have to wake up early?

06:19.140 --> 06:20.368
Hey, <i>malaka...</i>

06:26.014 --> 06:28.642
You come to beach tonight? To party?

06:28.783 --> 06:31.115
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:31.252 --> 06:33.049
They are supposed to be
coming with me tomorrow,

06:33.154 --> 06:34.485
but maybe it's a big mistake.

06:34.623 --> 06:37.285
They're all fucking crazy in the head.

06:53.675 --> 06:57.338
So, there was this hotel heiress
who dyed her hair blonde.

06:58.313 --> 07:00.907
But the carpet didn't match the drapes.

07:01.016 --> 07:03.746
So she stripped it away.

07:03.852 --> 07:06.150
What is it? What's the joke?
What's so funny? I'm not...

07:06.287 --> 07:07.276
You don't want to know, Mathias.

07:07.389 --> 07:11.120
But the hardwood floor underneath it
was all scuffed up and dirty!

07:11.226 --> 07:14.161
So she buffed it.

07:14.829 --> 07:16.990
But then it was too slippery.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.525
Who's gonna dance with me?

07:21.670 --> 07:24.730
Come on. Come on.

07:24.873 --> 07:27.034
I'm just not feeling this one.

07:27.175 --> 07:30.303
Jeff, buddy, we got two days left.
I wanna see some moves.

07:30.412 --> 07:32.380
It's just like playing the trombone.

07:32.514 --> 07:36.211
Jeff used to play the trombone
in high school.

07:37.419 --> 07:38.579
- Jeffrey on the trombone, nice!
- He won a prize.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.086
Thank you for sharing that
with everybody.

07:41.222 --> 07:44.020
Now he's gonna be a doctor.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.593
And he's gonna win a prize for that.

07:46.728 --> 07:47.990
Mathias!

07:48.096 --> 07:49.563
Hey, the Greeks!

07:50.732 --> 07:52.700
Hey, what's up? How are you?

07:52.801 --> 07:56.066
Amy! Amy! No, no! No!

07:56.204 --> 07:57.865
- Amy! No, no, no, no!
- Amy!

07:57.972 --> 07:59.906
I'll take some. I'll take some.

08:02.444 --> 08:03.706
I have her.

08:09.117 --> 08:11.779
Amy, it's time to go to bed. Let's go.

08:12.887 --> 08:15.117
No, I don't want to.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.587
Come on.

08:19.794 --> 08:22.354
All right, I'm calling it a night, guys.

08:22.464 --> 08:25.433
- Good night. Give me a kiss.
- Come here.

08:25.567 --> 08:26.761
- Give me a kiss.
- Stay.

08:26.901 --> 08:28.095
- See you, buddy!
- Make sure she gets home.

08:28.236 --> 08:29.601
- Night, Jeff!
- Okay?

08:30.805 --> 08:32.102
- I'll see you guys tomorrow morning.
- All right.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.298
- Yeah.
- Be good, man.

08:33.441 --> 08:35.932
- My boyfriend, the rock star!
- See you, Ame.

08:38.313 --> 08:40.405
- Matteo!
- Mathias.

08:40.515 --> 08:41.708
Mathias.

08:42.784 --> 08:45.309
Show me a German dance. Come on.

08:45.487 --> 08:47.114
You want a German dance?

08:47.255 --> 08:48.950
Like a waltz?

08:49.090 --> 08:51.081
- Come on!
- Yeah...

08:51.192 --> 08:52.284
Drag you?

08:52.427 --> 08:53.621
Nobody wants to dance!

08:53.762 --> 08:56.322
- You want me to dance? I can't dance.
- It's so beautiful!

08:56.464 --> 08:58.728
So, how much you wanna bet
she kisses him?

08:58.833 --> 09:03.429
She's freaking out 'cause Jeff's med
school is like 2,000 miles away, okay?

09:04.005 --> 09:05.996
- You do a twirl.
- Okay, how much?

09:06.141 --> 09:08.302
- She's not gonna kiss him.
- That's nice.

09:08.443 --> 09:10.138
- Yeah, it's good, yeah?
- Yeah, how do you do that?

09:10.278 --> 09:11.973
All right, you know what?

09:12.113 --> 09:15.810
Oral sex. Winner receives.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.248
Oral sex. Okay.

09:18.353 --> 09:21.754
- All right, more of the hips.
- Use the hips. Like this.

09:28.997 --> 09:30.521
Jeff's a nice guy, yeah.

09:30.665 --> 09:33.759
Come here. Come here.
I wanna tell you a secret.

09:36.337 --> 09:37.827
Amy!

09:37.939 --> 09:39.133
Amy!

09:39.240 --> 09:40.537
- Yes!
- Amy!

09:41.442 --> 09:43.637
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

09:43.745 --> 09:45.713
I will dance with you, okay?

10:04.766 --> 10:05.755
Crazy Greeks.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.994
No. The place that they went, here.

10:09.103 --> 10:12.436
It's only on this old map.
It's gone from the guidebook.

10:17.412 --> 10:19.209
What are you doing?

10:19.314 --> 10:24.342
He's making a copy of the map from
the girl Heinrich met, for his friends.

10:24.452 --> 10:28.047
Yes, your friends look like
they could use a map.

10:28.156 --> 10:30.215
All right. Give me a couple of minutes?

10:30.325 --> 10:31.451
- Rally the troops?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:31.593 --> 10:33.117
- Half an hour in the lobby?
- Yeah.

10:33.261 --> 10:34.888
- Okay.
- All right.

10:43.304 --> 10:45.204
Do you know
what they do to people down here

10:45.306 --> 10:46.796
who don't honor their bets?

10:46.941 --> 10:48.238
Bus leaves in like 15 minutes.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.935
They smash their hands.

10:50.845 --> 10:52.574
No, they do. They take broomsticks,

10:52.680 --> 10:54.580
and they just like, whack,
smash their hands.

10:54.682 --> 10:56.616
I mean, it's a true story.
It's kind of brutal, but it happens.

10:56.751 --> 10:58.116
What are you gonna do?

10:58.253 --> 11:00.619
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on!

11:00.755 --> 11:03.087
Come on! Jeff's gonna be pissed
if we miss it.

11:03.191 --> 11:05.386
The terrible wrath of Jeff,

11:05.493 --> 11:08.087
followed, I'm sure, by the even more
frightening whining of Amy.

11:08.196 --> 11:09.424
She's not that bad.

11:09.530 --> 11:13.296
No, but I bet she's feeling pretty
awkward right about now, don't you?

11:14.602 --> 11:16.263
Don't say anything.

11:16.371 --> 11:17.963
I mean it. Not a word.

11:18.106 --> 11:19.130
- Come here.
- Come on!

11:19.274 --> 11:22.266
Look, be a shame
to smash these pretty little hands.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.776
Will you please get in the shower?

11:23.878 --> 11:26.403
Come here for a second. Come here.
Come here.

11:27.482 --> 11:29.416
You know,
you're in Mexico now, <i>muchacha.</i>

11:29.517 --> 11:31.417
<i>Muchacha?</i>

11:31.519 --> 11:35.683
And you can't just lose a bet like that
and expect to walk away free.

11:37.158 --> 11:39.752
How much do I owe you again?

11:39.861 --> 11:41.829
I'll be quick. So quick.

11:47.802 --> 11:48.791
Okay.

11:51.172 --> 11:53.003
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

11:55.043 --> 11:57.409
You don't sound fine, honey.

11:57.545 --> 12:00.036
Hey, that's really helpful, thanks.

12:03.084 --> 12:05.644
Here you go. Come on.

12:05.753 --> 12:07.050
Let's get going.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.485
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- What?

12:14.429 --> 12:18.991
You're gonna be back tonight.
I'll just, like, sleep until then.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.660
You wanna spend
our last day sleeping?

12:25.473 --> 12:28.704
I'll just hang out, like read or something.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.176
Amy. Come on.

12:31.279 --> 12:34.874
People come from all over the world
just to see these ruins.

12:34.983 --> 12:38.214
And this one isn't even on the map.

12:38.319 --> 12:40.184
I'm not taking you
to some tourist trap, honey.

12:40.288 --> 12:42.688
Don't you wanna have some experience
or something to shoot,

12:42.790 --> 12:46.123
other than just the beach, the pool,
the beach, the pool?

12:46.260 --> 12:50.356
Well, you're already dressed.
You might as well just go without me.

12:54.102 --> 12:55.126
Hey.

13:04.512 --> 13:06.878
But I don't wanna go without you.

13:14.956 --> 13:17.254
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah?

13:17.358 --> 13:19.258
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

13:22.363 --> 13:23.421
Ready?

13:23.531 --> 13:25.624
What are you so happy about?

13:31.639 --> 13:33.402
Watch out for that.

13:35.676 --> 13:37.075
I'm sorry.

13:38.713 --> 13:39.771
Wow.

13:44.552 --> 13:46.679
- Amy, there's a puppy!
- Heinrich?

13:46.821 --> 13:47.810
Hello?

13:49.557 --> 13:50.819
- What?
- I don't know.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.323
So, now what?

13:52.460 --> 13:54.087
We take taxi.

13:54.195 --> 13:57.028
- How far?
- 18 kilometers.

13:57.165 --> 13:58.462
Hey, how many miles is that?

13:58.566 --> 14:01.967
It's about 11. Maybe a little bit more.

14:02.070 --> 14:07.531
Then there's a path,
which we hike for 4 kilometers.

14:07.675 --> 14:08.972
2.5 miles.

14:09.077 --> 14:10.806
Okay, no one said anything
about a hike.

14:10.912 --> 14:12.470
Amy!

14:12.580 --> 14:14.673
- Stacy!
- Come here!

14:14.782 --> 14:18.479
Well, I don't see any cabs.
That's a bit of a problem.

14:20.721 --> 14:21.813
What?

14:22.723 --> 14:25.317
- Yeah.
- I don't know what you're saying.

14:26.928 --> 14:28.020
There we go.

14:28.129 --> 14:29.255
Why?

14:30.865 --> 14:33.163
No, it's good. Is there a mirror?

14:49.951 --> 14:53.182
How much, you drive us here?

14:53.287 --> 14:55.755
No, no. This place, no good.

14:55.890 --> 14:58.518
I'll drive you to pyramid.
<i>Muy grande.</i> Everybody go.

15:02.263 --> 15:03.958
I take you. I take you.

15:04.098 --> 15:05.122
Yes.

15:05.266 --> 15:06.790
- Hey! Amy, Stace!
- Bye, puppy!

15:06.934 --> 15:08.697
I wanna stay with the puppy.

15:09.670 --> 15:10.694
- Let's go!
- You guys ready?

15:10.805 --> 15:11.794
- We got new hats.
- Very nice.

15:11.939 --> 15:14.874
- This is the taxi?
- Yeah, this is it. Come on. Let's go.

15:14.976 --> 15:17.444
My pants are gonna get dirty.

15:20.948 --> 15:22.643
Hey, Jeff. Can you give me some water?

15:22.783 --> 15:23.951
Take a picture.

15:23.951 --> 15:24.042
Take a picture.

16:03.391 --> 16:05.951
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this must be.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.789
How you feeling?

16:09.630 --> 16:10.756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:13.801 --> 16:15.428
Oh, my God, I'm so glad that's over.

16:15.536 --> 16:16.594
You okay?

16:16.704 --> 16:19.673
- My jeans are all dirty.
- Do you have a <i>tel√©fono?</i>

16:20.408 --> 16:21.670
Thanks.

16:26.814 --> 16:28.111
Bye, puppy!

16:31.552 --> 16:33.918
Wait, how are we gonna get back?

16:36.891 --> 16:38.722
We're gonna call him when we get out.

16:38.859 --> 16:40.417
With what?
We're not gonna get a signal out here.

16:40.561 --> 16:43.758
My phone should work.
It's a world phone.

16:43.898 --> 16:45.263
Hello? Can you hear me now?

16:45.399 --> 16:46.423
It's not funny, Eric.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.364
It's like a 20-mile hike
I'm gonna do in flip-flops.

16:48.469 --> 16:49.731
Eleven.

16:49.870 --> 16:51.565
It's a little funny.

16:52.573 --> 16:54.200
Yeah, it's working.

16:55.309 --> 16:56.742
- Problem solved.
- Can I have my sunglasses?

16:56.877 --> 16:58.276
Is that your brother's Jeep?

16:58.412 --> 17:00.346
Yeah, it is.

17:02.817 --> 17:04.682
It's not funny.

17:04.785 --> 17:05.944
It's a little funny.

17:06.087 --> 17:07.111
We go. Coming?

17:07.255 --> 17:09.051
Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's go. Ready?

17:09.156 --> 17:10.281
- Yeah.
- Come on.

17:10.424 --> 17:12.255
Want a piggyback ride?

17:12.393 --> 17:13.382
- No.
- No?

17:18.465 --> 17:22.903
So, there was this girl who got really,
really drunk one night.

17:23.003 --> 17:26.462
But she sobered up really,
really quickly.

17:26.607 --> 17:27.938
Who is this?

17:28.075 --> 17:30.305
Just the stupid game
that they were playing last night.

17:30.444 --> 17:33.436
But not before she stuck
her tongue down some guy's throat.

17:33.581 --> 17:34.741
Eric.

17:37.351 --> 17:38.545
How much further is it?

17:38.653 --> 17:42.612
We cross a stream,
then there should be a path to the left.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.452
If we seen a village,
then we've gone too far.

17:44.592 --> 17:45.820
Wait, there's a village?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.723
Yeah. A Mayan village.

17:49.463 --> 17:51.829
Why did we leave the hotel again?

17:56.871 --> 17:58.771
Whoa!

17:58.873 --> 18:00.602
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18:01.809 --> 18:03.401
Just almost fell.

18:05.012 --> 18:07.242
- Fucking stinks.
- Whoa.

18:07.348 --> 18:08.645
You stink.

18:10.618 --> 18:12.142
- How much further past the stream is it?
- You're funny.

18:12.286 --> 18:14.117
Right after, it says.

18:16.624 --> 18:19.115
Yeah, well, I don't see any path.

18:19.226 --> 18:21.251
Can I have some... Thanks.

18:25.533 --> 18:27.125
My legs are sore.

18:30.204 --> 18:31.535
Look!

18:33.074 --> 18:34.098
Don't scare them.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.699
I'm not gonna scare them. Hello!

18:41.349 --> 18:42.816
They look sad.

18:44.552 --> 18:45.610
Hello?

18:45.720 --> 18:48.314
- You guys wanna go talk to them?
- Yeah.

18:48.422 --> 18:50.583
Maybe they can guide us.

18:52.893 --> 18:54.224
I don't think they speak Spanish.

18:54.362 --> 18:55.522
Look.

18:59.233 --> 19:00.825
Where's he going?

19:02.870 --> 19:05.361
It's here. This must be it.

19:07.141 --> 19:08.904
That's the path?

19:09.043 --> 19:10.408
Why was it covered?

19:10.544 --> 19:12.569
I don't think that's the right path.

19:12.713 --> 19:14.112
- It's on the map?
- Yeah.

19:14.248 --> 19:15.272
It's on the map.

19:15.416 --> 19:16.883
Jeff, do you see how old
that map looks?

19:16.984 --> 19:19.919
And it was covered.
Why would it be covered?

19:20.054 --> 19:22.284
Maybe the archaeologists don't want
people to find their site, guys.

19:22.423 --> 19:24.687
Great. They're gonna be thrilled
to see us then.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.350
No, maybe they just found something
valuable, you know,

19:26.460 --> 19:27.449
and they don't want people to rob it,

19:27.595 --> 19:30.462
and just get the Mayans
to keep people away.

19:32.133 --> 19:34.226
- How far away is it?
- It's not far.

19:35.436 --> 19:37.768
- Just feels weird.
- Well, what do you wanna do?

19:37.905 --> 19:40.738
Just turn around
and walk all the way back?

19:49.150 --> 19:52.950
A hidden path
in the middle of the jungle.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.998
So, do you think
those kids were Mayans?

20:14.141 --> 20:15.267
I mean, aren't the Mayans extinct?

20:15.376 --> 20:17.606
Didn't they die
of some fucked up disease?

20:17.711 --> 20:19.770
That's great, Eric.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.814
We could be walking through
an ancient graveyard right now.

20:21.949 --> 20:23.644
Like a bone depository or something.

20:23.784 --> 20:25.479
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I doubt it.

20:25.619 --> 20:27.177
Did you just mimic me?

20:27.321 --> 20:29.983
No, no, I was agreeing with you.

20:30.124 --> 20:31.250
He was totally mimicking you.

20:31.358 --> 20:33.019
Was I? Was I really?

20:34.295 --> 20:35.319
Wow.

20:35.463 --> 20:36.487
Oh, wow.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.501
- Finally!
- I think this is it.

20:41.635 --> 20:43.125
See, honey?

20:45.172 --> 20:46.161
Wow.

20:46.307 --> 20:47.934
- It's beautiful.
- It is.

20:48.042 --> 20:50.169
- Can I have my glasses?
- Yeah.

20:51.846 --> 20:54.007
- Aren't you glad you came?
- Here.

20:55.816 --> 20:57.283
Look, that's it.

21:00.588 --> 21:01.612
Well, we made it.

21:01.722 --> 21:04.247
Can I have a drink? Thank you.

21:04.391 --> 21:06.052
Hey, Stace.

21:06.193 --> 21:08.354
Mexico!

21:08.462 --> 21:09.827
I know I'm a dork.

21:09.930 --> 21:11.227
Mathias?

21:12.366 --> 21:14.061
Is that a tent?

21:14.201 --> 21:15.225
Where?

21:15.369 --> 21:17.234
Up there in the corner.

21:18.372 --> 21:19.566
Good job!

21:40.661 --> 21:41.923
Heinrich!

21:42.062 --> 21:44.360
Maybe he wants some money.

21:44.465 --> 21:46.456
What, like a toll or something?

21:55.643 --> 21:56.974
Amy. Stop.

22:10.157 --> 22:13.752
What the fuck do they want?

22:13.861 --> 22:16.056
Show a picture of your brother.

22:16.163 --> 22:17.596
On the phone.

22:18.799 --> 22:19.823
Wait.

22:27.975 --> 22:30.136
- We're trying to find...
- You seen him?

22:51.365 --> 22:52.423
- Ame, don't move!
- Stop!

22:52.533 --> 22:53.932
- Amy! Amy!
- Okay.

22:54.034 --> 22:55.262
Don't move. Just don't move.

22:55.369 --> 22:57.428
- Give to them! Give to them <i>fotograf√≠a!</i>
- Jeff!

22:57.538 --> 22:58.971
- Give to me camera.
- Ame, don't move!

22:59.073 --> 23:00.199
Hey!

23:02.676 --> 23:04.871
- What the hell was that?
- Dimitri.

23:06.213 --> 23:07.544
Want the camera?

23:07.681 --> 23:09.046
Easy. Easy, just...

23:16.724 --> 23:18.885
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:19.059 --> 23:20.549
Stop!

23:30.270 --> 23:32.033
- Amy! Amy!
- Oh, God!

23:33.273 --> 23:34.365
Jeff!

23:35.776 --> 23:36.902
Heinrich!

23:44.418 --> 23:45.942
I need to stop.

23:48.322 --> 23:51.416
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Stace. Stace. Look at me.

23:51.558 --> 23:53.219
- I can't breathe.
- Stacy! Look at me!

23:53.327 --> 23:54.351
Come on, we gotta go! Come on!

23:54.461 --> 23:56.190
There's more coming!

24:03.070 --> 24:04.435
Heinrich!

24:17.418 --> 24:20.581
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:20.721 --> 24:22.188
Oh, my God, Dimitri!

24:25.292 --> 24:26.418
Oh, my God.

24:27.795 --> 24:30.195
Why would they do that?

24:30.297 --> 24:31.855
I can't breathe.

24:32.966 --> 24:34.934
Eric, get your phone out.

24:36.737 --> 24:38.364
There's no signal.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.738
Really? Because if there was a signal
on the road you should be able to...

24:42.843 --> 24:45.710
- No, I didn't get one.
- What do you mean?

24:45.813 --> 24:47.371
- No, I mean, I never said...
- "Can you hear me now?"

24:47.481 --> 24:49.608
- What the fuck was that, Eric?
- What the fuck? It was a joke!

24:49.750 --> 24:52.310
Stop! Stop! Both of you, stop! Please!

24:54.455 --> 24:56.286
Mathias had a signal.

24:56.423 --> 24:57.617
Where's your phone?

24:57.758 --> 24:59.885
The man. He took it.

25:08.368 --> 25:09.835
Is it the dig?

25:15.175 --> 25:16.335
Heinrich?

25:18.212 --> 25:20.510
Maybe there's another way down.

25:46.273 --> 25:47.706
Heinrich?

25:51.211 --> 25:53.008
My God...

25:57.050 --> 25:58.017
Heinrich!

26:02.222 --> 26:03.780
Oh, shit.

26:05.058 --> 26:06.025
Oh, Jesus.

26:27.781 --> 26:28.748
I'm sorry.

26:43.463 --> 26:45.260
They keep coming.

26:46.633 --> 26:48.123
They're setting up camps.

26:48.368 --> 26:49.733
Why are they doing this?

26:50.604 --> 26:51.969
Jesus Christ, they killed them both.

26:53.173 --> 26:55.539
I mean what about the girl.
What happened to her?

26:55.642 --> 26:57.473
- The one that Heinrich...
- Just stop it, Eric.

26:57.578 --> 26:59.705
I mean, is she okay? Is she even here?
What happened?

26:59.813 --> 27:02.805
Just stop it okay. Stop talking.

27:04.451 --> 27:06.646
- Give the water, Amy.
- What happened?

27:06.987 --> 27:07.954
It's the plant.

27:08.989 --> 27:11.719
He's having some sort of
allergic reaction to it.

27:12.292 --> 27:13.816
Why are they doing this?

27:13.927 --> 27:15.485
Maybe they're preparing for something.

27:15.596 --> 27:17.188
Like a sacrifice.

27:19.867 --> 27:21.300
It has something to do with the ruins.

27:21.401 --> 27:23.266
They won't come up here.
Now that we're here,

27:23.370 --> 27:25.838
they won't let us leave.

27:25.973 --> 27:28.965
So, what do we do,
just wait for someone to find us?

27:29.076 --> 27:30.168
Who?

27:31.678 --> 27:32.975
The Greeks.

27:35.749 --> 27:38.980
Dimitri left them a copy of the map
before we left.

27:41.021 --> 27:44.047
Yeah, and what if they decide
not to come, Jeff?

27:45.192 --> 27:47.160
Then somebody else will.

27:47.261 --> 27:49.354
We're supposed to check out
of the hotel tomorrow.

27:49.496 --> 27:52.397
The hotel's gonna call the police.

27:52.532 --> 27:53.556
When?

27:54.868 --> 27:56.961
Tomorrow or the day after.

27:58.005 --> 28:01.702
- Our flight is tomorrow, Jeff.
- I know, Amy.

28:01.842 --> 28:04.174
But we know what happens if we leave.

28:04.278 --> 28:06.576
Yeah, but what are we gonna eat?
Like, where do we sleep?

28:06.713 --> 28:08.681
We should save this.

28:08.782 --> 28:10.306
Hey, she's thirsty.

28:10.417 --> 28:13.477
I know. We just don't have that much.

28:13.587 --> 28:17.353
Well, why do you get to decide, Jeff?

28:17.457 --> 28:20.392
Okay. Well, we can all decide.

28:20.527 --> 28:23.519
But just keep in mind that each of us
needs a half a gallon of water

28:23.630 --> 28:25.860
every day, just to survive.

28:25.966 --> 28:29.094
And right now,
we don't even have a day's worth.

28:32.039 --> 28:33.006
Maybe he's right.

28:36.076 --> 28:37.202
What is that?

28:37.311 --> 28:38.505
Hold on.

28:40.580 --> 28:40.781
A cell phone?

28:40.781 --> 28:42.043
A cell phone?

28:44.484 --> 28:45.746
- Heinrich's.
- Are you sure?

28:45.886 --> 28:48.684
Yeah, it's his ringtone.
We had the same phone.

28:48.789 --> 28:50.586
How can there be a signal?
There's not a signal up here.

28:50.724 --> 28:52.419
It's definitely a phone.

28:52.559 --> 28:54.390
Amy, in the orange tent,
there's a lantern hanging

28:54.494 --> 28:57.725
and some matches on the ground.
Can you get them?

28:57.831 --> 28:58.889
Eric?

28:58.999 --> 29:00.057
- Eric.
- Yeah.

29:00.167 --> 29:01.691
- Come figure this out. Drop that there.
- Okay.

29:01.802 --> 29:04.100
Come on. Amy? All right, pull it now.

29:04.237 --> 29:05.534
This thing needs to be off, right?

29:05.639 --> 29:07.197
Come on.

29:09.109 --> 29:10.940
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.743
- You got it?
- Yeah, that's it. Let's do this.

29:13.847 --> 29:16.281
- Okay.
- Sure? You ready?

29:17.284 --> 29:18.376
Yeah.

29:43.877 --> 29:46.038
- Jeff? Jeff?
- Yeah?

29:47.481 --> 29:48.846
The rope, I think...

29:48.982 --> 29:50.677
- Whoa. Up, up, up!
- Wait, wait, wait!

29:50.817 --> 29:53.445
- Pull it up! Up!
- Pull him up! Hurry!

29:53.553 --> 29:54.611
- What?
- Hurry!

29:54.721 --> 29:56.313
What is it? What?

30:00.761 --> 30:01.989
Oh, shit.

30:03.263 --> 30:04.958
Mathias!

30:05.065 --> 30:07.499
- Mathias?
- Mathias?

30:07.601 --> 30:09.535
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ.

30:10.771 --> 30:13.706
- Oh, Jesus. Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.000
Is he...

30:15.909 --> 30:17.877
No, I can hear him.

30:22.215 --> 30:23.842
One of you has to go.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.383
Go? Go where?

30:27.354 --> 30:29.254
Down. We're gonna check
the rest of the rope

30:29.389 --> 30:30.754
and make sure it's secure.
And then one of you can...

30:30.891 --> 30:34.190
Why do we have to go?
Why can't you or Eric?

30:34.294 --> 30:36.592
'Cause you're not strong enough.

30:36.730 --> 30:38.664
We need to work the crank.

30:44.438 --> 30:46.167
I'll go.

30:46.273 --> 30:47.672
- You will?
- Yeah.

30:47.774 --> 30:49.332
Let me check.

30:51.945 --> 30:53.242
Thank you.

31:04.958 --> 31:08.189
Just help him into the sling,
and then we're gonna pull him out.

31:08.295 --> 31:09.284
Once we get him out,

31:09.429 --> 31:11.056
we're gonna drop the rope
and pull you back up, okay?

31:11.164 --> 31:12.631
- Stace?
- Yeah?

31:14.901 --> 31:16.198
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:16.303 --> 31:18.533
Hey. You okay?

31:18.638 --> 31:19.798
Yep.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.907
Here you go.

31:28.014 --> 31:30.107
- Stace, you gotta step off.
- We got you.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.274
Okay.

31:35.489 --> 31:36.513
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:36.656 --> 31:38.180
You got it?

32:20.100 --> 32:21.192
Stacy?

32:21.334 --> 32:22.528
What?

32:22.669 --> 32:24.296
It's the end of the rope!

32:24.404 --> 32:25.803
I'm not at the bottom!

32:25.906 --> 32:27.737
How much further is it?

32:30.310 --> 32:31.937
Can you jump?

32:32.045 --> 32:33.512
Can I what?

32:33.647 --> 32:35.080
Can you jump?

32:38.151 --> 32:40.449
Please. Help me.

32:43.623 --> 32:44.817
Okay.

32:57.837 --> 32:59.429
Stace?

32:59.539 --> 33:00.767
You okay?

33:07.847 --> 33:09.542
I cut my knee!

33:11.218 --> 33:13.152
Can you see Mathias?

33:14.888 --> 33:17.118
Yeah, but it's dark!

33:17.224 --> 33:19.624
We're gonna send the matches down.

33:21.728 --> 33:22.990
Hurry!

33:27.934 --> 33:29.629
Come on. Think.

33:30.737 --> 33:32.329
What can we use?

33:33.773 --> 33:35.468
What about the tents?

33:35.575 --> 33:38.840
You know, we could take one down,
cut the nylon into strips.

34:00.634 --> 34:02.727
I'm scared.

34:02.869 --> 34:05.099
I can't move my legs.

34:05.238 --> 34:07.001
You guys?

34:07.107 --> 34:11.065
You guys, I think he broke his back!
He can't move his legs!

34:11.210 --> 34:12.735
And it smells!

34:12.911 --> 34:14.539
Like what?

34:14.648 --> 34:15.945
Like shit!

34:20.219 --> 34:21.915
We're gonna have to build a backboard.

34:22.054 --> 34:23.784
No way. We can't move him.

34:23.922 --> 34:25.447
Look, we are not
leaving him down there, okay?

34:25.592 --> 34:27.456
How about the backpack frames
and the tent poles?

34:27.594 --> 34:29.562
Are you listening to yourself?
Okay, this is insane.

34:29.663 --> 34:31.187
We have to wait for help, okay?

34:31.297 --> 34:33.766
Stacy, we have to build a backboard!

34:36.436 --> 34:37.460
Okay.

34:37.603 --> 34:38.592
Amy, there's tape in the tent.

34:38.737 --> 34:41.639
Jeff, we cannot move someone
with a broken back, okay?

34:41.775 --> 34:43.572
- Amy, we have no choice.
- You know that!

34:43.677 --> 34:45.440
You have to go down
and help lift him on!

34:45.578 --> 34:46.567
No.

34:48.014 --> 34:50.208
- We have to tell them.
- Tell who?

34:50.317 --> 34:54.083
We have to tell them.
Maybe they could call someone.

34:54.187 --> 34:55.245
They can send for help.

34:55.355 --> 34:56.844
Amy, they're not gonna send for help.

34:56.989 --> 34:58.958
No, we have to try, Jeff.

35:01.661 --> 35:03.629
Amy. Amy! Amy!

35:04.664 --> 35:05.688
Amy!

35:20.580 --> 35:21.638
Amy.

35:22.248 --> 35:23.806
Amy! Ame.

35:27.220 --> 35:28.983
Help us, please.

35:30.023 --> 35:32.048
We need your help.

35:32.192 --> 35:34.319
Someone's been hurt.

35:34.427 --> 35:36.827
Amy, they can't understand you.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.124
Say it in Spanish.

35:38.231 --> 35:39.493
They don't speak Spanish, Ame.

35:39.599 --> 35:40.964
- Just try!
- Ame.

35:48.108 --> 35:49.666
Amy, they've already killed Dimitri.

35:49.776 --> 35:51.243
I know you're scared.

35:51.378 --> 35:52.504
I didn't want to come.

35:52.612 --> 35:55.547
- Look at me. Amy. It's gonna be okay.
- I said I...

35:55.682 --> 35:58.048
- I shouldn't be here.
- We're gonna get out of this.

35:58.184 --> 36:00.482
Okay? Ame?

36:00.587 --> 36:01.713
Please.

36:03.022 --> 36:04.751
- They have to help us.
- Ame.

36:05.558 --> 36:07.185
They have to. No, they have to!

36:07.293 --> 36:08.726
Ame, Ame! Amy!

36:09.929 --> 36:11.191
I don't want us to get shot, Ame. Please.

36:11.297 --> 36:12.866
- Why won't you fucking help us?
- Ame!

36:12.866 --> 36:13.764
- Why won't you fucking help us?
- Ame!

36:29.048 --> 36:30.777
Ame. Ame.

36:55.341 --> 36:57.400
His mother was right there.

37:01.114 --> 37:02.877
He touched the vine.

37:06.453 --> 37:07.818
We all have.

37:14.961 --> 37:16.155
Stacy?

37:17.330 --> 37:18.888
Can you see it?

37:33.480 --> 37:35.277
Is there anyone there?

37:40.487 --> 37:42.011
I can't see it!

37:45.124 --> 37:47.285
I wanna come back up!

37:57.971 --> 37:59.268
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:04.010 --> 38:05.807
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:05.912 --> 38:06.970
All right, let's go.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.945
Stace, I'm coming down!

38:30.937 --> 38:32.837
A few more feet!

38:32.939 --> 38:35.169
That's all there is!

38:36.376 --> 38:38.537
- We have to send it back up.
- No, no.

38:38.678 --> 38:41.340
Amy, I can't stay down here any longer.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.547
We can just lift him.

38:45.685 --> 38:47.846
One of us at his shoulders,
the other person at his feet.

38:47.954 --> 38:49.012
What if he twists?

38:49.122 --> 38:52.558
It's only a couple of feet, Amy.
We can just lift him.

38:53.893 --> 38:55.861
Can you still do it, Ame?

39:02.602 --> 39:03.694
Okay!

39:05.138 --> 39:06.662
I'm gonna try!

39:08.808 --> 39:10.036
Mathias.

39:10.143 --> 39:12.373
- Mathias, we're gonna lift you, okay?
- Okay.

39:12.478 --> 39:15.208
We're gonna lift you up and out of here.

39:21.588 --> 39:22.953
Okay.

39:24.290 --> 39:26.758
- His hips.
- Are you sure?

39:26.859 --> 39:29.885
If you lift him at the feet
he's gonna bend at the waist.

39:29.996 --> 39:34.057
Yeah, but I lift him here from his hips,
it's gonna arch his back.

39:35.535 --> 39:36.900
His knees.

39:41.941 --> 39:43.932
Okay, quickly. On three, okay?

39:44.043 --> 39:46.068
One, two, three!

39:46.179 --> 39:47.840
Oh, my! Oh, my God!

39:50.116 --> 39:51.447
Just get him on!

40:08.568 --> 40:09.967
Pull him up!

40:36.429 --> 40:38.659
Maybe we should carry him into the tent.

40:38.765 --> 40:39.993
Squeeze my hand.

40:40.099 --> 40:41.657
So he's not cold.

40:43.703 --> 40:46.797
I don't think we should move him again.

40:46.906 --> 40:50.137
Yeah, but we can't leave him out
in the open like this at night.

40:50.243 --> 40:54.009
Let's see if we can find him
some aspirin or something, okay?

40:55.715 --> 40:58.047
To keep his blood moving. Guys?

41:00.386 --> 41:04.846
Look in the tents. Check the backpacks.
See what you guys can find.

41:28.247 --> 41:29.373
Guys?

41:30.583 --> 41:31.675
Guys?

41:32.452 --> 41:35.615
Look. Dimitri's plane ticket.

41:35.755 --> 41:37.086
How does that help us?

41:37.223 --> 41:39.953
He was supposed to leave
tomorrow morning.

41:40.093 --> 41:41.583
On a 7:05 flight.

41:41.728 --> 41:43.286
So when he doesn't show up tomorrow,

41:43.429 --> 41:45.294
his friends are definitely gonna know
that something's wrong.

41:45.431 --> 41:47.729
How will they know where we are?

41:47.834 --> 41:51.065
They have the map.
Dimitri copied the map for them.

41:52.605 --> 41:55.870
So they'll be here tomorrow.

41:55.975 --> 41:59.240
We just have to make it through tonight.
That's it.

42:00.513 --> 42:04.472
Maybe one of us should keep watch
while the other guys sleep.

42:04.617 --> 42:05.743
Sleep?

42:14.460 --> 42:15.927
It's working.

42:25.204 --> 42:26.501
How is he?

42:32.278 --> 42:34.439
We gotta keep his legs clean.

42:35.848 --> 42:38.339
That's how it'll happen if it does.

42:41.287 --> 42:43.619
If what does?

42:43.723 --> 42:45.782
If he dies here.

42:45.892 --> 42:47.291
Infection.

42:48.461 --> 42:50.429
Jeff, he's not gonna die.

42:53.332 --> 42:55.698
- Ame?
- Yeah?

42:57.203 --> 42:59.797
I never should've said to lift him up,
should I?

42:59.906 --> 43:01.168
I never should have said to lift him.

43:01.307 --> 43:03.867
- Don't, Stace. Please.
- It's my fault.

43:05.511 --> 43:06.637
Stace?

43:09.348 --> 43:12.215
We're gonna get him
to the hospital tomorrow, okay?

43:12.351 --> 43:14.285
He's gonna be okay.

43:14.387 --> 43:15.479
Okay?

43:17.356 --> 43:19.324
We just gotta rest.

43:20.860 --> 43:22.327
Come on, Stace.

43:23.496 --> 43:26.488
The Greeks will be here tomorrow.

43:26.599 --> 43:28.066
Stace, come on.

43:40.413 --> 43:42.142
Give me your hand.

44:35.401 --> 44:36.368
Come closer.

47:13.626 --> 47:14.684
- Eric!
- What?

47:14.794 --> 47:16.591
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

47:16.729 --> 47:17.753
- Eric!
- What?

47:17.897 --> 47:21.264
- Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
- Okay, okay.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.699
Oh, my God. It's inside my leg.

47:24.804 --> 47:26.567
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

47:26.705 --> 47:28.195
- Get it out, get it out, get it out!
- Okay, okay.

47:28.307 --> 47:29.604
Okay. Okay.

47:29.742 --> 47:31.175
Oh, my God!

47:32.078 --> 47:34.205
Okay, okay, okay.

47:34.313 --> 47:35.712
Get it out.

47:38.984 --> 47:40.042
What happened?

47:40.152 --> 47:41.779
Help me.

47:41.921 --> 47:43.616
Something's wrong.

47:44.723 --> 47:46.884
Please. Something's wrong.

47:48.994 --> 47:50.052
It's okay.

47:50.162 --> 47:51.857
- Moving! I can feel it moving!
- Stop! No. I got it out!

47:51.964 --> 47:53.397
- It's moving!
- Stace. What?

47:53.499 --> 47:54.523
The vine, it was inside her.

47:55.434 --> 47:57.527
- Show me my legs.
- Okay.

47:57.636 --> 47:59.433
- Show me them!
- Okay.

48:01.273 --> 48:02.365
Jeff!

48:03.275 --> 48:05.573
- Jeff!
- Help me, please!

48:08.247 --> 48:10.807
- Get it off me! Get it off!
- Jeff!

48:11.951 --> 48:13.578
Help me!

48:13.686 --> 48:16.814
Help me! Help me!

48:16.956 --> 48:18.287
Take them off me!

48:18.424 --> 48:21.757
Mathias! You just sit there and breathe.

48:21.861 --> 48:23.829
Breathe, Mathias.

48:23.963 --> 48:28.400
I'm gonna make a tourniquet right now.
I'm gonna cut off this bleeding, Mathias.

48:28.501 --> 48:30.264
It's on our clothes.

48:31.871 --> 48:34.897
It's... It's growing on us.

48:45.784 --> 48:46.773
The phone.

48:52.625 --> 48:57.085
I don't know how long these'll burn,
so you're gonna have to be quick.

48:57.196 --> 49:00.324
I'd wait to light them
till you're both down there.

49:00.466 --> 49:03.629
Link arms. One of you look to the right,
the other, your left.

49:03.736 --> 49:06.534
You'll cover more ground that way.

49:06.672 --> 49:09.971
Search a spot and then move on. Okay?

49:41.073 --> 49:42.199
Okay!

49:49.882 --> 49:51.349
Okay.

50:07.733 --> 50:09.223
Be careful.

50:22.147 --> 50:23.375
Okay.

50:26.585 --> 50:28.052
Amy, wait, wait.

50:28.153 --> 50:30.451
Come on. We have to find it.

50:34.860 --> 50:36.760
Just stay next to me.

50:59.818 --> 51:01.012
Amy?

51:04.056 --> 51:07.287
- That's where it's coming from.
- I can't.

51:07.393 --> 51:10.191
- Come on.
- I don't wanna go in there. Amy.

51:10.329 --> 51:12.024
We have to.

51:13.899 --> 51:15.662
We have to find it.

51:22.808 --> 51:24.639
It's okay, come on.

51:28.881 --> 51:30.041
Okay.

51:36.155 --> 51:37.622
Okay. Ame?

51:53.605 --> 51:54.970
Hello?

52:10.556 --> 52:12.023
Oh, my God.

52:15.427 --> 52:16.826
The phone.

52:24.937 --> 52:26.871
- It was just ringing.
- Let me see.

52:26.972 --> 52:28.906
Yeah. It's cracked.

52:43.422 --> 52:44.616
Amy.

53:12.918 --> 53:14.886
Amy! Amy!

53:17.489 --> 53:18.956
Oh, my God!

53:22.995 --> 53:24.223
Go!

53:25.164 --> 53:26.893
Run, Stace! Go!

53:36.875 --> 53:38.308
Amy!

53:42.448 --> 53:43.915
Amy!

53:52.958 --> 53:54.448
Jump on!

53:54.560 --> 53:57.120
Pull us up! Pull it up!

53:57.229 --> 53:58.321
Pull!

54:03.802 --> 54:05.133
Go!

54:08.807 --> 54:10.035
Come on!

54:11.410 --> 54:12.809
Come on!

54:15.280 --> 54:17.305
- Are you okay, Ame?
- Get it off!

54:17.416 --> 54:18.474
Did you find the phone, Amy?

54:18.584 --> 54:19.573
- It's not a phone!
- Amy!

54:19.718 --> 54:22.016
No, there is no fucking phone!

54:22.621 --> 54:25.317
What happened?
Stace, what happened?

54:31.597 --> 54:34.930
What do you mean,
the flower was making the ring?

54:35.067 --> 54:37.433
It was vibrating
and it was ringing like a cell phone.

54:37.569 --> 54:39.764
How? Amy, how does it do that?

54:41.306 --> 54:43.900
I don't know, Eric. I don't know.

54:44.710 --> 54:46.678
It was moving. It was alive.
It knows we're here.

54:46.778 --> 54:48.109
We just have to go.
We have to go. We just...

54:48.247 --> 54:49.839
We can't do that, Stace.

54:49.948 --> 54:53.748
Jeff, you didn't see it. Okay?

54:55.287 --> 54:57.346
I'm not staying here.

54:57.456 --> 54:59.947
If we try to leave, they kill us.

55:01.159 --> 55:04.458
Mathias can't move.
I can't just leave him here.

55:05.998 --> 55:10.025
Okay, maybe we don't all have to go.
I mean, I could go. I can get help.

55:10.135 --> 55:12.865
They have guns, Eric.

55:12.971 --> 55:17.465
There are 50 of them, 60.
They killed that little kid, Amy.

55:17.609 --> 55:19.304
Okay, so you guys make a distraction.

55:19.444 --> 55:20.468
I can make it to the Jeep.

55:20.612 --> 55:22.307
- I can do it.
- It's too dangerous, Eric.

55:22.447 --> 55:24.813
- We have to wait.
- Wait for what, huh?

55:26.451 --> 55:27.440
For the Greeks.

55:27.586 --> 55:29.554
Jeff, the Greeks can't find
their own fucking hotel room.

55:29.655 --> 55:30.713
- Eric.
- They're not gonna come out here

55:30.822 --> 55:33.950
- and rescue us.
- We're being quarantined here.

55:34.092 --> 55:36.322
We are being kept here to die!

55:36.461 --> 55:38.258
This doesn't happen!

55:39.331 --> 55:43.062
Four Americans on a vacation
don't just disappear!

55:48.206 --> 55:50.174
Somebody,

55:50.309 --> 55:54.143
the police, our parents,

55:56.381 --> 55:57.905
the Greeks,

55:59.551 --> 56:00.643
somebody,

56:00.786 --> 56:03.118
somebody is going to find us.

56:03.221 --> 56:06.190
We just have to be alive when they do.

56:12.998 --> 56:15.592
Where are those keys, Amy?

56:15.701 --> 56:19.137
- Amy, where are the keys?
- They're in the backpack.

56:19.271 --> 56:23.230
No. We stay close.
We wait until we're found.

56:24.443 --> 56:27.241
We keep someone always on guard.
We keep our wounds covered.

56:27.346 --> 56:30.804
And we look out after each other.
That is the only way.

56:33.552 --> 56:35.349
Somebody's coming.

56:36.855 --> 56:38.584
Somebody's coming.

57:00.045 --> 57:01.842
One swallow apiece.

57:03.582 --> 57:04.981
Stace.

57:53.398 --> 57:55.992
It's still in there. I can feel it.

57:56.968 --> 57:58.697
See, look how puffy it is.

57:58.804 --> 58:01.398
That's just swelling. It's natural.

58:01.540 --> 58:04.100
It's just what happens
when you cut yourself, okay?

58:04.242 --> 58:06.733
He won't last much longer like this.

58:10.115 --> 58:12.845
- We have to cut them off.
- Cut what off?

58:16.388 --> 58:18.948
- His legs.
- Tell me you're joking.

58:21.059 --> 58:24.586
- He'll die if we don't.
- Just please tell me you're joking.

58:24.730 --> 58:28.188
He'll get infected, if he isn't already.
Septicemia.

58:28.300 --> 58:30.734
Well, what the hell is septicemia, Jeff?

58:30.836 --> 58:35.864
An infection, usually in the bones,
when it's exposed to bacteria.

58:37.609 --> 58:38.633
You're fucking crazy.

58:38.777 --> 58:41.075
No, I'm telling you,
he won't last through the day like this.

58:41.179 --> 58:42.976
Without anesthesia?

58:44.316 --> 58:46.750
He has no feeling beneath his waist.

58:46.852 --> 58:49.320
The tourniquets are already in place.
We're gonna cut below them.

58:49.454 --> 58:50.819
With what?

58:54.493 --> 58:55.687
A knife?

58:58.463 --> 59:00.590
We have to break the bones first
and then cut.

59:00.699 --> 59:03.361
Well, we're not cutting his legs off
with a fucking hunting knife, Jeff.

59:03.502 --> 59:06.198
There's no flesh
covering his bones, Eric.

59:06.338 --> 59:08.169
He is going to die.

59:12.744 --> 59:15.611
Okay. Okay, fine. Let's fucking vote.

59:15.714 --> 59:19.514
You know, raise your hands
if you want to cut off his legs.

59:27.192 --> 59:29.183
Stacy, what are you doing?

59:29.327 --> 59:31.192
He's in med school, Eric.

59:31.329 --> 59:33.627
Yeah. Yeah, he's in med school.

59:33.732 --> 59:36.826
He's not a surgeon. He's not a doctor.
He's in school.

59:36.935 --> 59:38.800
I'm entitled to my vote, Eric.

59:38.904 --> 59:40.462
You do it.

59:42.874 --> 59:44.398
Cut them off.

59:46.845 --> 59:48.369
Cut them off.

59:53.084 --> 59:54.210
Yeah.

59:56.955 --> 01:00:01.324
I'll break the bones first, with the stone,
then use the knife to cut through.

01:00:01.426 --> 01:00:02.586
Okay.

01:00:02.727 --> 01:00:06.493
We're heating the pan to cauterize
the wounds to stop the bleeding.

01:00:06.598 --> 01:00:08.327
You're not gonna be able to feel a thing,

01:00:08.433 --> 01:00:13.336
but if you want to bite down on this,

01:00:13.438 --> 01:00:15.497
you can, just in case.

01:00:17.275 --> 01:00:19.004
Eric, you ready?

01:00:28.386 --> 01:00:30.547
You should wait in the tent.

01:00:47.939 --> 01:00:49.531
Grab his feet.

01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:52.933
That foot. Turn it up.

01:01:32.517 --> 01:01:35.611
Hold him down! Eric! Eric!

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.017
God!

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:48.429
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

01:01:52.237 --> 01:01:53.568
It's okay.

01:01:53.872 --> 01:01:55.237
- Eric!
- Jeff!

01:01:55.473 --> 01:01:57.407
Hold him fucking still!

01:02:20.498 --> 01:02:21.726
Jeff!

01:02:25.904 --> 01:02:28.304
Jeff, he felt it, didn't he?

01:02:28.406 --> 01:02:29.634
Jeff!

01:02:31.176 --> 01:02:33.371
- He has nerve damage.
- Yeah.

01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:36.173
He can't feel anything
beneath his waist.

01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:37.475
He was screaming, Jeff.

01:02:37.582 --> 01:02:39.174
He was screaming.
He was telling you to stop.

01:02:39.284 --> 01:02:42.344
He was screaming. How could
he not feel it when he was screaming?

01:02:42.454 --> 01:02:43.648
It's just the visual.

01:02:43.755 --> 01:02:46.849
- It was him looking down and seeing it.
- This is so not okay!

01:02:46.958 --> 01:02:49.222
We didn't have a choice, Amy.

01:02:50.362 --> 01:02:52.330
Amy. It's...

01:02:54.366 --> 01:02:56.334
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.094
Oh, God.

01:03:00.238 --> 01:03:01.728
What the fuck.

01:03:05.443 --> 01:03:07.673
Look, how can it do that?

01:03:33.238 --> 01:03:34.865
Check your phone.

01:03:39.744 --> 01:03:41.211
Let me see.

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.014
I just wanna go home.

01:05:21.364 --> 01:05:24.026
Do you think Stacy's gonna be okay?

01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:31.436
Yeah.

01:05:32.475 --> 01:05:35.774
I mean, I got it out. I saw it come out.

01:05:38.114 --> 01:05:40.605
Yeah, she just really believes...

01:05:41.751 --> 01:05:43.582
You know how she is.

01:05:45.087 --> 01:05:47.783
She gets something in her head and...

01:05:53.596 --> 01:05:55.791
she convinces herself.

01:06:06.675 --> 01:06:11.977
Do you think that
they're ever gonna find us?

01:06:14.984 --> 01:06:16.474
Honestly?

01:06:18.687 --> 01:06:21.815
I think making a run for it
is our only chance.

01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:29.989
I know.

01:06:38.841 --> 01:06:40.638
Amy, come here, come here.

01:06:54.723 --> 01:06:55.815
Eric.

01:06:58.494 --> 01:07:00.257
What the fuck?

01:07:00.362 --> 01:07:02.023
What?

01:07:02.164 --> 01:07:03.927
I heard you.

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:06.627
- You heard me what?
- I heard you fucking her.

01:07:06.735 --> 01:07:07.861
Excuse me?

01:07:08.003 --> 01:07:10.801
- Don't lie to me, Eric. I heard you.
- Stace.

01:07:10.906 --> 01:07:12.965
I heard you. I heard you fucking her!

01:07:13.075 --> 01:07:14.133
Stacy, come on.

01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:16.370
How could you do that to me?

01:07:16.512 --> 01:07:19.811
How could you guys fucking sit there
and fuck when I'm in the tent?

01:07:19.915 --> 01:07:21.883
Stace, you need to calm down.

01:07:22.017 --> 01:07:23.951
Don't tell me what I should do.

01:07:24.053 --> 01:07:25.384
Stacy, you know I wouldn't do that.

01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:28.149
- I heard you, Eric.
- We were just talking. I was just...

01:07:28.257 --> 01:07:31.556
- I heard you moaning, Amy.
- I was crying, Stacy.

01:07:31.694 --> 01:07:34.561
- What's going on?
- My boyfriend is fucking your girlfriend!

01:07:34.697 --> 01:07:37.188
- That's what's going on.
- She's just crazy and irrational.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:40.666
- You think she's never cheated on you?
- Stacy.

01:07:42.738 --> 01:07:44.035
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, bitch!

01:07:44.173 --> 01:07:46.733
Fuck you! All you ever cared about
is your fucking self!

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:49.674
- Stacy, stop it.
- Don't fucking touch me!

01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:52.406
Relax. You're scared.

01:07:52.548 --> 01:07:56.143
She would've slept with Mathias
if I hadn't stopped her.

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:01.183
Mathias.

01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:48.799
Well, thank God we cut his legs off.

01:08:48.938 --> 01:08:50.234
Shut up.

01:08:56.645 --> 01:08:58.305
It's eating me like it's eating him.

01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:02.212
- Stace.
- No. It's inside. It's inside of me.

01:09:02.318 --> 01:09:03.785
Stacy.

01:09:03.919 --> 01:09:06.979
It's in my side, Amy. It's in my... It's...

01:09:07.122 --> 01:09:11.649
I'll show you. It's here.
If you just cut here and here...

01:09:11.794 --> 01:09:12.783
- Stacy.
...and here.

01:09:12.928 --> 01:09:15.328
- Stacy.
- Stacy, you're okay.

01:09:15.464 --> 01:09:17.055
- You're okay.
- You're not listening!

01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:19.157
- Stacy, you're fine.
- You're not listening!

01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:21.496
You are not listening!

01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:23.832
You're not listening to me!

01:09:42.957 --> 01:09:45.825
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:47.359
What the fuck?

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:52.291
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

01:09:52.968 --> 01:09:56.426
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

01:09:57.539 --> 01:09:59.598
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

01:10:07.683 --> 01:10:11.813
They don't want us to spread it.
That's why they won't let us leave.

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:17.516
They're salting the soil

01:10:22.598 --> 01:10:24.532
to keep it contained.

01:10:32.941 --> 01:10:36.604
It's old. It has to be. Really old.

01:10:36.745 --> 01:10:41.773
Because the birds, the insects,

01:10:41.917 --> 01:10:45.284
somehow they've learned
not to land here.

01:10:46.955 --> 01:10:50.948
And the horses. Remember?
How frightened the horses were?

01:10:51.093 --> 01:10:52.788
It didn't happen.

01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:57.193
What she said about Mathias.

01:11:00.336 --> 01:11:03.931
- I didn't...
- You don't have to say anything.

01:11:04.073 --> 01:11:05.404
But I do.

01:11:05.507 --> 01:11:08.135
- Because I don't want you to...
- Amy.

01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:14.873
Look at us.

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:23.558
Would it matter to you?

01:11:30.866 --> 01:11:32.094
Guys?

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:37.771
Show them.

01:11:55.691 --> 01:11:57.158
- Okay. Stace.
- I didn't mean to.

01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:59.783
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:03.456
We're gonna start with the one
in your leg. Okay, Stace?

01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:10.529
It's okay.

01:12:15.077 --> 01:12:16.135
I'm sorry.

01:12:16.245 --> 01:12:20.045
- It's okay.
- You might wanna close your eyes.

01:12:20.182 --> 01:12:23.982
I wanna see. I wanna see it.

01:12:32.394 --> 01:12:35.022
Stacey, keep breathing, okay?

01:12:35.764 --> 01:12:37.925
Through your nose.

01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:40.364
Good. Just keep breathing,
keep breathing.

01:12:40.469 --> 01:12:43.199
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

01:12:43.305 --> 01:12:46.570
- Okay. Okay. All right, he's almost done.
- I got it.

01:12:49.378 --> 01:12:50.743
It's okay.

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:53.339
Okay?

01:12:53.449 --> 01:12:56.111
Should I stop?
Stacy, do you want me to stop?

01:12:56.251 --> 01:12:57.343
No.

01:13:06.662 --> 01:13:09.688
- I'm scared. No.
- It's okay. Keep breathing.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.799
Okay, okay.

01:13:15.137 --> 01:13:16.934
Okay, okay.

01:13:24.546 --> 01:13:25.911
It's almost out.

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:28.346
No! Oh, no!

01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:33.888
Oh, my God!

01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:36.854
Okay, it's okay.

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:39.723
- He got all of it.
- The shirt up.

01:13:39.828 --> 01:13:42.092
Hold the other one.

01:13:42.231 --> 01:13:44.722
It's okay. I'm here.

01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:50.936
Please.

01:14:16.698 --> 01:14:18.461
Stace.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.468
There's more of it. There's more.

01:14:22.604 --> 01:14:27.769
Right here. Under. Under the muscle,
like by the bone there.

01:14:27.876 --> 01:14:29.673
There's nothing there, Stacy.

01:14:29.811 --> 01:14:33.770
- Yes, can we cut it?
- There's no more cutting.

01:14:34.816 --> 01:14:36.579
I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:37.947
- I wanna cut it. I wanna...
- Hey, don't!

01:14:38.053 --> 01:14:41.750
Hey! You can't. You can't keep cutting.

01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:45.758
- It's just everywhere. It's in my head.
- No.

01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:48.125
- It's okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:52.098
- Yeah, you're okay.
- No, no. I'm not okay. I'm not okay.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.160
You keep saying I'm okay. I'm not okay.
Why do you keep saying that to me?

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:03.710
Here, this might help.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.792
What? What?

01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:34.332
Amy, did you see it?
You saw it, didn't you?

01:15:34.443 --> 01:15:37.469
You saw it in my head. I felt it.

01:15:37.579 --> 01:15:38.739
Amy.

01:15:40.515 --> 01:15:42.983
Amy, please tell me.

01:15:43.085 --> 01:15:45.679
- Stacy.
- Why won't you look at me?

01:15:45.787 --> 01:15:47.311
Stacy, Stacy...

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:49.515
- You saw it?
- It's okay.

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:52.753
- You saw it? Did you see it?
- No, I... There's nothing there.

01:15:52.894 --> 01:15:55.419
There's nothing there, okay? I swear.

01:15:55.564 --> 01:15:58.226
It's in my head. I feel it, you guys.

01:16:06.475 --> 01:16:08.909
- Let's move her in the tent.
- Okay.

01:16:10.979 --> 01:16:13.573
No one's coming. I'm going tonight.

01:16:21.857 --> 01:16:23.484
<i>I wanna cut it.</i>

01:17:50.011 --> 01:17:52.411
<i>I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.</i>

01:17:55.383 --> 01:17:59.649
<i>I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.</i>
<i>I wanna cut it.</i>

01:18:22.043 --> 01:18:24.170
Stacy, what are you doing?

01:18:30.819 --> 01:18:32.343
Oh, my God!

01:18:38.059 --> 01:18:40.550
It's okay. It's okay.

01:18:40.662 --> 01:18:43.597
I just... I just have to get this one out.

01:18:44.666 --> 01:18:46.099
It's okay.

01:18:49.638 --> 01:18:51.606
Just have to get this one.

01:18:53.608 --> 01:18:55.473
- Stacy?
- No. No.

01:18:56.244 --> 01:18:58.872
- Stacy, give it to me.
- No. No.

01:18:59.648 --> 01:19:01.878
- Give it to me right now.
- No!

01:19:03.251 --> 01:19:04.411
Jeff?

01:19:06.087 --> 01:19:07.145
I'm very sorry.

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:09.587
- I have to get this piece right here...
- Stacy.

01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:12.751
...in my...
- Stacy, give me the knife. Stacy.

01:19:13.829 --> 01:19:14.921
Stacy, give me the knife, okay?

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:16.725
Don't touch me!

01:19:29.544 --> 01:19:31.136
Easy, stay down.

01:19:31.279 --> 01:19:33.474
Eric! Eric!

01:19:35.016 --> 01:19:36.916
- Eric!
- Oh, my God!

01:19:38.887 --> 01:19:40.445
Stay down.

01:19:40.555 --> 01:19:42.113
Eric! Eric!

01:19:46.127 --> 01:19:48.857
Eric! Amy!

01:19:49.965 --> 01:19:51.364
Come here. Come here.

01:19:51.499 --> 01:19:54.161
Amy! Eric! Eric!

01:19:57.639 --> 01:19:59.869
Eric! Amy! Amy!

01:20:03.645 --> 01:20:07.547
Amy, I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:10.145
It hurts.

01:20:10.252 --> 01:20:11.879
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to!

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.683
- Stacy.
- Eric! Eric! It hurts.

01:20:15.824 --> 01:20:17.553
Don't move. Don't move.

01:20:17.692 --> 01:20:19.023
Eric?

01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:24.159
Eric? Eric? Eric!

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.624
Eric? Eric?

01:20:27.569 --> 01:20:29.127
No! No.

01:20:30.105 --> 01:20:31.663
No! No!

01:20:31.773 --> 01:20:35.641
- Eric! Eric!
- Come here. Come here.

01:20:35.744 --> 01:20:39.646
Eric! Eric! Eric!

01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:44.843
Stacy.

01:20:46.955 --> 01:20:50.413
- Amy. Amy, it hurts.
- No.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.660
- No. No.
- It hurts.

01:20:58.566 --> 01:21:01.399
Kill me. Amy, kill me.

01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:03.735
Amy.

01:21:04.973 --> 01:21:08.033
Kill me. Kill me!

01:21:08.143 --> 01:21:09.735
- Jeff.
- Amy!

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.214
- Kill me! Kill me!
- It's okay.

01:21:14.316 --> 01:21:16.011
Stace.

01:21:16.117 --> 01:21:17.948
You have to, Amy.

01:21:19.955 --> 01:21:21.388
Kill me! Amy!

01:21:21.489 --> 01:21:25.050
- Yes! Kill me! Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.061
- <i>Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!</i>
- Amy.

01:21:40.342 --> 01:21:41.604
Jeff.

01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:47.412
Kill me!

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.911
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

01:22:08.036 --> 01:22:10.266
Once you're past the clearing,

01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:16.808
you run as fast as you can, okay?

01:22:20.682 --> 01:22:21.944
Okay?

01:22:27.589 --> 01:22:29.682
When you get to the Jeep,

01:22:37.065 --> 01:22:41.001
you don't wait for anything. Anything.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:47.166
And if these don't work, then you run,

01:22:49.077 --> 01:22:51.978
and you don't stop
until you reach the town.

01:22:54.949 --> 01:22:59.249
You promise me that you'll still be here?

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:03.555
Okay.

01:24:07.188 --> 01:24:09.554
You don't even know her name.

01:24:17.198 --> 01:24:19.598
You don't know any of our names.

01:24:33.515 --> 01:24:37.281
I'm Jeff. Jeff Dean MacIntyre.

01:24:38.653 --> 01:24:40.484
Winnetka, Illinois.

01:24:43.892 --> 01:24:45.689
Twenty-two years old.

01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:51.257
I was gonna be a doctor.
That was my dream.

01:24:57.672 --> 01:24:59.469
That's all I wanted.

01:25:11.085 --> 01:25:13.383
You should know her name, too.

01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:21.518
Her name

01:25:22.897 --> 01:25:24.364
is Amy!

01:25:27.035 --> 01:25:30.300
And she is not gonna die
on this fucking hill!

01:25:30.405 --> 01:25:31.531
Jeff!

01:26:56.257 --> 01:26:59.658
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:26:59.794 --> 01:27:01.091
Please.

01:27:24.419 --> 01:27:25.716
Okay.

01:27:31.492 --> 01:27:32.754
Okay.

01:28:04.726 --> 01:28:06.717
- Dimitri!
- Dimitri!

01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.007
Dimitri!
