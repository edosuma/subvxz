WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:02.962
This is an exciting day.

00:03.045 --> 00:07.425
We are going to tackle one of the most famous
ethical dilemmas

00:07.883 --> 00:08.968
The Trolley Problem.

00:09.051 --> 00:11.220
Is this a game? I go first! I call blue!

00:11.303 --> 00:12.680
There's no... No, this is...

00:13.097 --> 00:13.973
No.

00:14.015 --> 00:19.812
This is a thought experiment first introduced
by British philosopher Philippa Foot

00:19.854 --> 00:21.063
in 1967.

00:21.355 --> 00:25.192
You are driving a trolley
when the brakes fail.

00:25.359 --> 00:30.698
And on the track ahead of you
are five workmen that you will run over.

00:30.740 --> 00:34.076
Now, you can steer to another track

00:34.118 --> 00:36.871
but on that track
is one person you would kill

00:36.912 --> 00:39.248
instead of the five.
What do you do?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.208
Do we know anything about the people?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.294
Like, is one of them an ex-boyfriend

00:43.586 --> 00:45.838
or that snooty girl from Rite Aid

00:45.880 --> 00:48.340
who was always silently judging
my purchases?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.760
It's like, "Yeah, chicky! A Baby Ruth
and birth control."

00:50.801 --> 00:52.678
"I see the irony. Keep a-swiping!"

00:52.720 --> 00:54.722
You don't know any of the workers.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.057
OK, well then, that's easy.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.392
I switch tracks, kill one person
instead of five.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.686
But this is hard, cos the only trolley
I've ever been on

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
is James Franco's ironic trolley

01:02.438 --> 01:06.400
it travels backwards from his penguin grotto
to his garage of adult tricycles.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.695
Um... kill one, save five.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.448
I kill the one guy, but me and the five
other guys

01:12.656 --> 01:15.743
we get together every year,
no matter how busy we are

01:15.868 --> 01:18.245
and we pour one out for our flat homie.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.622
Good!

01:19.663 --> 01:20.998
We'd all switch tracks.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.958
But there's a lot of other versions of this.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.877
Like, what if you knew one of the people?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.712
Does that change the equation?

01:26.754 --> 01:29.298
Or what if you're not the driver,
you're just a bystander?

01:29.465 --> 01:31.759
Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.

01:31.801 --> 01:36.180
Let's say you're a doctor,
and you can save five patients.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.767
But you have to kill one healthy person

01:39.809 --> 01:41.936
and use his organs to do it.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.270
But that's not the same thing.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.230
But why not?

01:44.522 --> 01:48.734
It's still choosing to kill one person
to save five, isn't it?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.152
Michael.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.530
You've been kind of quiet.
What do you think about all this?

01:52.738 --> 01:55.699
Well, obviously the dilemma is clear.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.119
How do you kill all six people?

01:58.494 --> 02:01.038
So, I would dangle a sharp blade
out the window

02:01.080 --> 02:03.582
to slice the neck of the guy
on the other track

02:03.749 --> 02:06.001
as we smoosh our five main guys.

02:08.546 --> 02:09.421
Oh...

02:09.463 --> 02:11.340
I did the thing again, didn't I?

02:11.423 --> 02:12.883
Yep. Ten more, buddy.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.010
People. Good. People... Gah.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.720
Why is that so hard to remember?

02:16.804 --> 02:17.721
People...

02:18.139 --> 02:19.014
what is it?

02:19.056 --> 02:19.932
Good.
- Good.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.108
Cool. Later, guys.

02:29.733 --> 02:34.029
Oh, hey, twerps. We have an hour before
we have to pretend to be tortured by Vicky.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.407
You wanna hang out? We could work on our
forced grins?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.366
Check mine out.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.162
"Oh, this place is miserable! Etcetera!"

02:41.287 --> 02:43.289
That sounds fun.
- Right?

02:43.330 --> 02:46.458
But I was going to dive into next week's
reading, I'm afraid, sorry.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.752
Jason, do you, um... care to join?

02:48.878 --> 02:49.753
Sure, dog.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.173
You're doing extra-credit work?

02:52.298 --> 02:54.925
What can I say? This class is more fun
than I thought.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.558
Eleanor seemed a little suspicious
earlier...

03:03.017 --> 03:04.143
snooping around.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.770
You didn't tell her about us, did you?

03:07.438 --> 03:08.314
No.

03:08.898 --> 03:11.775
Why are you so scared that someone will know
we're pounding it out?

03:11.901 --> 03:15.237
Precisely because you refer to love-making
as "pounding it out."

03:15.446 --> 03:18.574
Who cares about what other people might think
about us being together?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.660
Maybe you should talk about this
with a friend.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.122
But then that person would know
we were together.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.959
Right. Then you can talk about why it is
that you don't want anyone to know

03:29.001 --> 03:29.877
we're together.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.504
But then that person would know
and I don't want anyone to know.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.464
I know.

03:33.631 --> 03:36.842
I'm saying you should talk to someone
about how weird it is

03:36.884 --> 03:39.637
that you don't want to talk to someone
about how we're together.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.806
How's it going, Teach?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.808
Mm, kitchen looks nice and crazy.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.853
I've been wracking my brain, trying to find
a way to get through to Michael.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.607
What do you think about writing a rap musical
about Kierkegaard?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.067
I think that's a terrible idea.

03:53.108 --> 03:53.984
Cool.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.657
Michael's not going to learn
how to be a good person overnight.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.158
He's not even a person. He's just a...

04:01.200 --> 04:05.412
bunch of evil shoved up
the butt of an evil mannequin.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.790
You know, teaching him to be good,
it's like...

04:07.831 --> 04:09.792
teaching me how to be not hot.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.043
How would you even do it?

04:11.252 --> 04:14.338
You'd have me hunch or something,
and stand there and say

04:14.713 --> 04:15.589
"Gurp."

04:15.839 --> 04:16.715
"Gurp."

04:17.258 --> 04:18.133
"Gurp."

04:18.175 --> 04:20.135
I don't even know. I can't even picture it

04:20.177 --> 04:22.263
because I've been hot my whole life.
- I'm sorry...

04:22.304 --> 04:24.473
who is this conversation for again?
- It's for you.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.392
I believe in you, nerd-boy.

04:26.850 --> 04:31.063
If you can teach me and Jason ethics,
you can teach anybody.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.439
Thanks.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.360
But definitely a "no" on the rap musical?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.028
I mean, if you really--

04:38.070 --> 04:40.155
<i>♪ My name is Kierkegaard
and my writing is impeccable ♪</i>

04:40.197 --> 04:42.199
<i>♪ Check out my Teleological
suspension of the ethical! ♪</i>

04:42.324 --> 04:43.367
No.
- No!

04:43.409 --> 04:44.410
Right?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.995
Nah, felt like a "no" when I was doing it.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.540
Janet?

04:49.581 --> 04:50.457
Hi there.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.459
If I were to tell you something personal
about myself

04:52.501 --> 04:54.753
you couldn't tell anyone about it, right?
- Right.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.214
So in a way, you're sort of like a therapist?

04:57.256 --> 04:58.173
Absolutely not.

04:58.424 --> 05:02.553
A therapist is a trained medical professional
with the ability to absorb and process

05:02.594 --> 05:04.888
complex ideas about human emotion.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.892
I am simply a vessel containing all of the
knowledge in the universe.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.144
Close enough.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.313
Jason and I are sleeping together.
- OK.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.690
Obviously, no one can ever know.
I mean, I wouldn't shag Jason

05:14.732 --> 05:16.191
if he were the last man on Earth.

05:16.400 --> 05:20.279
But, well he sort of is and I am.
Shagging him, I mean.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.865
And I think I'm losing my mind.
So please help me.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.952
Well, my job is to make your experience here
in the afterlife more enjoyable

05:27.202 --> 05:28.579
so I will try to help you.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.207
I am going to need some time to read
every book ever written

05:32.249 --> 05:33.834
about human psychotherapy.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.961
And now I've done that, so let's begin.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.421
Have a seat.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.592
Hi. I'm your therapist, Janet.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.054
I just want to have a little chat
about your progress.

05:45.179 --> 05:49.391
In the last homework assignment,
I asked you to examine the ethics

05:49.433 --> 05:53.062
of "Les Miserables," in which a man
steals a loaf of bread

05:53.103 --> 05:54.313
to feed his starving family.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.816
Would you...
please read your first paragraph, here?

05:58.525 --> 06:02.237
"Everyone in this story sucks
and belongs in the Bad Place."

06:03.614 --> 06:06.367
"The thief is bad, the officer
chasing him is bad"

06:06.408 --> 06:08.577
"all the whiny prostitutes are bad"

06:08.869 --> 06:12.122
"plus they're all French so they're
going to the Bad Place automatically."

06:12.623 --> 06:15.584
Do you see how you're already off-topic?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.045
Chidi, I... I've been around a long time.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.838
Like, all of it.

06:19.963 --> 06:23.092
But I know for a fact that if you steal
a loaf of bread

06:23.133 --> 06:25.094
it's a negative seventeen points.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.680
Twenty if it's a baguette,
because that makes you more French.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.598
OK, sure

06:29.640 --> 06:33.977
but philosophy is about questioning things
that you take for granted

06:34.019 --> 06:36.438
and I just don't think
that you're doing that.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.484
I mean, "I personally know that Victor Hugo
is in the Bad Place"

06:40.526 --> 06:41.568
"being tortured."

06:41.652 --> 06:46.073
"He's a real wuss, too. If one of the lava
monsters even gets near the guy"

06:46.115 --> 06:50.536
"he's like, <i>'Sacré bleu</i>, I peed in m'pants.'"

06:50.619 --> 06:54.498
I don't know what you want from me.
That... that's exactly what he said.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.626
Jason's a nice person, but...

06:58.085 --> 07:01.004
my suitors were always of a certain echelon.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.881
I used what I called the "Duke Rule"

07:02.923 --> 07:06.510
because "Duke" is both minimum acceptable
University and rank of nobility.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.763
You've never dated anyone
like Jason before.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.807
I mean, I've dallied below my station.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.893
I once had a brief fling with a non-famous
Hemsworth brother.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.063
But even Larry Hemsworth had more status
than Jason.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.065
Jason didn't even have a job.
- Mm.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.860
In a sad way, not in the good, rich way.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.195
Hi, guys. What are you doing?

07:25.529 --> 07:26.613
Sitting in a room?

07:27.156 --> 07:28.157
That's pretty cool.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.702
I took your suggestion, and I'm talking
to Janet about our relationship.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.997
Actually, it might help me if I could hear
Jason's side as well.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.332
Oh, no, no. That'll only slow things down.
Look, I'll tell you his side.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.127
He thinks that I have to control everything
and that he has no voice

07:40.169 --> 07:42.129
in this relationship. Right, Jason? Good.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.338
Now, where were we?

07:46.008 --> 07:47.426
I just heard that.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.386
OK, fine. I'll leave.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.183
I just don't feel like you're engaging
with the material.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.435
- Oh, come on.
- Like with the trolley problem.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.604
That was just tricky, that's all.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.856
Why don't you just tell me the right answer?

08:00.898 --> 08:03.108
Well, that's what's so great about the
trolley problem

08:03.150 --> 08:05.152
is that there is no right answer.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.573
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.991
I'm on your side here, dude.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.159
But he is not wrong.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.661
OK. Michael, trust me.

08:15.370 --> 08:20.542
When it comes to human ethics,
I just know more than you.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.962
I've been studying it my whole life.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.131
It's just that it's so theoretical, you know?

08:26.840 --> 08:31.428
I mean, you know, maybe there's a more
concrete approach.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.223
Here. Let's... let's try this.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.267
Oh, God!

08:37.309 --> 08:39.061
Michael, what did you do?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.438
I made the trolley problem real

08:41.480 --> 08:44.483
so we could see how the ethics
would actually play out.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.528
There are five workers on this track,
and one over there.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.821
Here are the levers to switch the tracks.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.822
Make a choice!

08:50.906 --> 08:52.950
The thing is... I mean, ethically speaking...

08:52.991 --> 08:55.452
No time, dude! Make a decision!
- Well, it's tricky.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.664
I mean on the one hand, if you ascribe to a
purely Utilitarian worldview...

09:03.544 --> 09:04.878
OK. So...

09:06.713 --> 09:07.589
What'd we learn?

09:11.051 --> 09:11.927
Chidi?

09:12.594 --> 09:13.595
Talk it out, buddy.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.056
What are we thinking?

09:16.098 --> 09:18.517
He thinks he just killed a bunch of people
with a trolley.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.893
It's just a simulation.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.104
I would never make you kill real people.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.730
Oh, well, that's reassuring.

09:24.064 --> 09:28.485
Because some of the parts of the fake people
flew into my mouth!

09:28.652 --> 09:30.821
Michael, can we just go back
to the classroom?

09:30.904 --> 09:31.780
We never left.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.907
Here, I'll show you.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.201
Ah...

09:37.160 --> 09:38.036
Yeah.

09:38.078 --> 09:38.954
OK...

09:38.996 --> 09:40.872
Look, see, buddy?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.666
- None of this was real.
- Well...

09:42.708 --> 09:45.586
Uh... I... I mean, their pain is real.

09:45.877 --> 09:49.881
It's like they're fake people,
but their deaths are real.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.133
Does that make sense?

09:51.425 --> 09:54.094
There have to be stakes or it's just another
thought experiment.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.345
This is awful.

09:55.554 --> 10:00.058
You specifically asked me if there was a way
I could connect with the material more.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.978
I'm trying, you guys.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.106
Sorry.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.482
You're right.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.527
I want to help you understand this.
- Thank you, Chidi.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.905
So. Let's try again, mm?

10:14.072 --> 10:17.034
Oh, um... I... I thought maybe we would
have a discussion.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.245
No, the whole point is to play out
the scenario in real time.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.830
Quick, Chidi! What's your decision?

10:21.872 --> 10:23.248
OK, OK, I can do this.

10:23.457 --> 10:27.753
I am choosing to switch tracks, so that way
I only kill one person.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.963
Oh, forgot to tell you...

10:30.005 --> 10:32.674
this is the scenario where you actually know
one of the people.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.468
It's your friend Henry, there.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.054
Chidi! How are you, mate?

10:37.095 --> 10:37.971
Henry! Move!

10:38.013 --> 10:39.681
Aw! Nice trolley!

10:39.723 --> 10:41.558
- Move out of the way!
- I can't, Chidi.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.852
My boots are stuck in the tracks.
- Henry, move!

10:43.894 --> 10:45.729
- Anyway, long time no--
- Get outta there!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.649
Oh, my God!

10:50.317 --> 10:52.152
Again, just the simulation.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.989
An almost impossibly life-like simulation.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.533
Would someone's foot really fly off
their body like that?

10:58.575 --> 10:59.868
That was kinda cool.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.454
Ethically speaking.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.248
Tahani's confusing.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.958
Mm.
- She's really smart.

11:07.084 --> 11:10.212
And she's all soft and smooth
like a bunch of water balloons

11:10.671 --> 11:13.799
but I tell her she's pretty
a hundred times a day

11:13.840 --> 11:16.551
and she's never said I'm pretty once.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.929
She always wants me to be different
from how I am.

11:19.388 --> 11:22.140
But I'm not different. I'm same!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.309
And how does that make you feel?

11:24.393 --> 11:27.145
I just feel like Tahani's embarrassed
that I'm not some sort of scientist

11:27.187 --> 11:28.647
who forecloses on banks.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.315
I need another session with Janet.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.442
It's my turn. I have a lot of problems too,
you know.

11:32.776 --> 11:36.738
Perhaps we could kill two birds
with one Janet, as it were.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.282
How would you feel about giving Jason and me
"couples therapy?"

11:39.533 --> 11:40.867
I'd feel great.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.417
Janet? What's happening?

11:48.792 --> 11:49.668
Unclear.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.129
My guess is I'm operating in a way
I'm not designed for

11:52.170 --> 11:53.714
and it's creating a small glitch.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.049
But if I'm helping you guys, I say

11:56.216 --> 11:58.552
"What has one thumb and wants to keep going?"

11:58.802 --> 12:00.178
"This not-lady."

12:00.637 --> 12:01.513
Eh?

12:02.305 --> 12:03.181
Eh?

12:05.350 --> 12:08.520
OK, so that was Trolley Problem version
number seven.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.940
Chidi opted to run over five
William Shakespeares

12:11.982 --> 12:14.860
instead of one Santa Claus.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.946
OK, as much as I'm enjoying watching random
people's heads fly off

12:18.405 --> 12:21.074
I think we've taken this trolley thing
as far as it can go.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.617
You might be right, Eleanor.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.077
Thank you.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.621
Let's try the doctor one.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.540
Dude! What the fork?

12:28.707 --> 12:32.127
These five people all need organ
transplants or they will die.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.712
Eleanor's perfectly healthy.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.589
Chidi, do you want to slice her open

12:35.630 --> 12:37.507
and use her organs to save the five
sick people?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.092
Chidi! Chidi. Think about this.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.552
I'm your hottest friend.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.678
No. Tahani.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.555
I'm your nicest fr...
No. Jason.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.890
I'm your friend.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.808
Save five people.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.894
No, I... I won't do it.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.314
As a doctor, I've taken the Hippocratic oath,
to do no harm.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.607
And although five people will die

12:53.648 --> 12:57.152
I cannot harm one innocent person
to save them, and forsake my oath.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.403
It's unethical.

12:59.863 --> 13:00.739
OK.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.199
Tell their families.
- What?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.245
Doctor Chidi?

13:07.954 --> 13:11.833
My daddy needed a heart transplant.
Did you save his life?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.544
I don't know what I would do
without my daddy.

13:15.170 --> 13:19.508
He was working, then a really bad man
ran him over with a trolley.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.927
Oh, come on!

13:22.177 --> 13:23.053
What?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.055
I'm finding this incredibly helpful.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.098
I think I'm really starting to get it.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.099
Oh, I know.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.019
We'll do the one where you're in a boat
next to a volcano

13:31.061 --> 13:35.315
and you can either save 50 people
or one awesome dog or whatever.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.192
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- Hey!

13:37.609 --> 13:38.819
Are you torturing us again?

13:39.569 --> 13:40.445
What?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.781
You don't care about learning ethics lessons.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.825
You're just torturing Chidi again,
aren't you?

13:46.409 --> 13:47.494
Busted!
- What?

13:50.914 --> 13:53.542
I'm sorry. Old habits die hard.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.670
Not as hard as those people you crushed
with the trolley, though.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.129
Boom!
- I'm sorry, is this...

13:58.171 --> 13:59.047
is this funny to you?

13:59.130 --> 14:01.383
Yeah, I thought that was clear
from my laughter.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.426
Oh, come on.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.972
My bad. Look, I'm still on your team.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.933
OK? I just needed to let off a little steam.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.560
Whoo...

14:11.601 --> 14:13.270
See? Back home, all good.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.939
No. No. Not all good.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.693
You keep saying that we need you
or we'll end up getting tortured forever

14:19.734 --> 14:23.405
but then when we do help you out,
we still end up getting tortured

14:23.446 --> 14:27.200
I'd rather just be tortured than choose it.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.494
You are no longer welcome in my class.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.371
Get the fork out!

14:37.085 --> 14:38.962
But I said, "My bad."

14:39.004 --> 14:40.338
Out!

14:42.799 --> 14:45.343
That was some pretty impressive
nerd rage yesterday.

14:45.677 --> 14:46.928
Didn't know you had it in you.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.681
You OK?

14:49.723 --> 14:52.475
You've been staring at the second page
of this book for an hour.

14:52.642 --> 14:58.106
When I'm really upset, concentrating on a
Table of Contents helps me calm down.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.110
It's like a menu, but the food is words.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.862
Oh... OK.

15:03.904 --> 15:07.073
I can't believe I actually thought he wanted
to learn from us.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.909
What he really wanted was to torture me.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.952
Using the thing that I love most
in the world.

15:10.994 --> 15:11.912
Woven belts?

15:12.704 --> 15:13.872
Oh, teaching, right.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.833
I'm sorry about this, Chidi.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.587
I made him take the classes
and I feel a little responsible.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.339
No, no, it's not your fault.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.132
Yeah, you're right, it isn't,
and no take-backs!

15:24.174 --> 15:25.967
No, a tiger can't change his stripes.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.595
This is what he always wanted.

15:28.637 --> 15:32.515
Me trying desperately to teach him something
that he never intended to learn

15:32.557 --> 15:35.560
so I'd end up miserable with my glasses
all smudged up

15:35.602 --> 15:37.479
from sweaty forehead stress-grease.

15:37.520 --> 15:41.524
OK. Gross. Also, I really don't think
that's true.

15:41.775 --> 15:42.692
Oh, no?

15:42.859 --> 15:46.696
What possible other reason could he have
to behave that way?

15:47.072 --> 15:50.033
Actually, I can think of one.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.370
Yesterday, Tahani gave us her reasons

15:53.411 --> 15:55.538
not to take this relationship public.

15:55.914 --> 15:56.790
Jason.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.792
How did that make you feel?

15:59.042 --> 16:00.460
Like she's being a jerk.

16:00.502 --> 16:04.047
OK, let's try that again, and this time,
I want you to use an "I" statement.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.298
OK, um...

16:05.840 --> 16:11.012
"Tahani is being a jerk," said I, Jason

16:12.013 --> 16:14.224
Tahani, what do you value about Jason?

16:14.516 --> 16:17.352
Well, he's nice, thoughtful.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.021
Picks flowers and brings them to me.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.024
Often, they're ones I've just planted but...

16:23.066 --> 16:26.403
That's how I know they're fresh.
- He's the least self-aware person

16:26.444 --> 16:27.362
I've ever met.

16:27.404 --> 16:30.073
He has massive amounts of unearned confidence

16:30.115 --> 16:33.326
and he's utterly unaware of his own
absurdity.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.453
Therefore, quite good at sex.

16:35.829 --> 16:39.040
But I'm sorry, I still don't want anyone
to know that we're together.

16:39.874 --> 16:40.875
Here's the thing

16:41.167 --> 16:44.129
I'm nice to you, and you're mean to me.

16:45.213 --> 16:48.800
There's something wrong about that
but I can't put my finger on what it is.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.053
Oh, Jason. I genuinely like you.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.098
But I need you to be patient with me.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.476
Back on Earth, all of my relationships were
either yacht-based flings

16:58.518 --> 17:02.731
on international waters, or glorified
photo-ops arranged by publicists.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.858
It's hard to change all at once.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.943
Can you give me a little more time?

17:07.402 --> 17:08.278
OK.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.614
I agree to keep this on the DL for now

17:11.990 --> 17:15.035
if you agree to grab my butt in public
once a week.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.080
You can say I sat in gum and that you're
trying to scrape it off.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.708
You do sit in a lot of gum.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.128
Aw, I'm happy for you guys.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.095
Huh.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.475
Look, I don't know what to tell you.
If Chidi can't take a joke, that's on him.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.810
Just like all that blood was.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.480
I can't high-five that!

17:44.314 --> 17:45.982
No matter how badly I want to.

17:46.024 --> 17:49.652
Look, this isn't about Chidi not being able
to take a joke.

17:49.694 --> 17:50.862
This is about you.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.864
You're doing what I used to do.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.908
You're "Pulling an Eleanor."

17:55.366 --> 17:57.869
Posting my cousin's credit card number
on Reddit

17:57.911 --> 17:59.287
because she said I looked tired?

18:01.331 --> 18:03.500
I forgot I did that.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.417
No!

18:04.459 --> 18:05.335
No.

18:05.376 --> 18:09.255
"Pulling an Eleanor" in this case
is lashing out when you feel like a failure.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.965
You couldn't hack the classes.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.344
They made you feel dumb and small
so you took it out on the teacher.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.805
You think I feel dumb and small?

18:17.180 --> 18:20.141
I'm an eternal being who can see
in nine dimensions.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.269
I can see from your aura
that you're about to fart quietly

18:23.311 --> 18:27.023
and then lie about it. And please don't,
because I can also see what you ate today.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.317
Dude, you can bluster and insult
all you want.

18:29.359 --> 18:33.863
Also Classic Shellstrop moves, by the way,
but deep down you know I'm right.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.908
Whatever. Eventually, Chidi will get over it.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.409
Ah! Ha-ha!

18:38.451 --> 18:40.870
Leaving it up to the other person
to be the grown-up

18:40.912 --> 18:43.039
yet another Classic Shellstrop move!

18:43.373 --> 18:45.291
You and I are really very similar.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.961
What does that say about me?
Ugh...

18:48.002 --> 18:49.129
Look, bro.

18:49.170 --> 18:54.217
The fact that Chidi straight up told you
to fork off should tell you how upset he was.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.302
That's the most decisive I've ever seen him.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.222
He once went to a Chinese restaurant
and couldn't choose between

18:59.264 --> 19:00.807
sweet and sour chicken.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.517
That's one thing!

19:03.768 --> 19:06.604
It's 100% on you to make this up to him.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.693
I screwed up.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.278
I'm owning it.

19:13.319 --> 19:17.240
I mean, I'm a superior being.
I ought to act like one.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.741
Right? So...

19:19.033 --> 19:21.035
I really thought about each one of you

19:21.077 --> 19:23.413
and I got you something
that will make you happy.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.622
I call them...

19:25.498 --> 19:26.958
"opposite tortures."

19:27.250 --> 19:28.376
Do you mean "presents"?

19:28.626 --> 19:30.003
Yes, that's better. Thank you.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.754
Tahani, here's yours.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.926
Holy mama! Is this a diamond?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.096
Yeah. Honestly, I... I don't get the appeal.

19:40.221 --> 19:44.767
Diamonds are literally carbon molecules
lined up in the most boring way.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.603
They're worthless space garbage.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.814
What you're holding right now,
that's basically meteorite poop.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.691
And I have the biggest piece!

19:52.025 --> 19:54.694
Eleanor, I had Janet make you...

19:54.861 --> 19:57.697
a never-ending shrimp dispensary.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.453
Oh!

20:06.664 --> 20:07.749
This is the dream.

20:07.916 --> 20:08.791
It is?

20:08.875 --> 20:09.751
Yeah!

20:10.043 --> 20:11.961
Jason, here you go.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.796
Pikachu!

20:14.047 --> 20:15.882
Guys, it's Pikachu!

20:16.424 --> 20:17.342
This is awesome!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.762
Aw, man...

20:22.305 --> 20:23.640
That was awesome though.

20:24.057 --> 20:24.933
Thanks, Michael.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.435
And finally... Chidi.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.939
You were a tough nut to crack,
but I think I figured it out.

20:34.525 --> 20:40.240
This is a replica of a lost notebook
from the desk of Immanuel Kant.

20:40.865 --> 20:44.953
It contains never-before-seen
thoughts and musings

20:45.161 --> 20:49.123
and several, uh... crude erotic doodles.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.416
Interesting guy, actually.

20:51.209 --> 20:54.379
The point is, no one on Earth
has ever seen this...

20:55.171 --> 20:56.089
except for you.

20:56.881 --> 20:57.757
Cool.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.929
This isn't an apology, it's a bribe,
and I'm not interested.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.555
Yeah, we can't be bought!

21:04.764 --> 21:08.518
What do you want from me, man?
You want me to give you a golden nameplate

21:08.559 --> 21:09.435
for your office?

21:09.519 --> 21:11.646
You want a diamond bigger than Tahani's?

21:11.688 --> 21:12.563
No!

21:12.981 --> 21:14.482
Then this would be worthless.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.068
I don't want anything.
- Oh! Oh.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.737
OK. Oh, I get it. I get it.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.739
You want me to admit that I was wrong.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.867
And you want me to say,
"Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry"

21:24.909 --> 21:29.872
"because I didn't understand human ethics
and you do, it made me feel insecure"

21:30.164 --> 21:32.500
"and I lashed out, and oh, please help me"

21:32.542 --> 21:35.962
"because I feel so, so lost and vulnerable."

21:37.755 --> 21:38.631
Yes.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.138
Oh, Chidi. I am so sorry.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.641
I, um... I didn't understand human ethics

21:48.683 --> 21:53.438
and... and you do and it made me
feel insecure and I lashed out.

21:54.814 --> 22:00.445
And I really need your help
because I feel so lost and vulnerable.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.781
Have a seat.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.621
Whoo!

22:11.205 --> 22:12.874
Nobody try "mystery flavour."

22:13.082 --> 22:15.168
It's white chocolate and it is nasty.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.132
Here are your papers

22:21.174 --> 22:26.262
and I have to say, you all have shown
tremendous improvement

22:26.387 --> 22:27.764
over the past couple of weeks.

22:27.805 --> 22:28.681
A C minus?

22:29.182 --> 22:30.266
I aced it!

22:30.892 --> 22:32.352
Wow! A plus?

22:32.393 --> 22:33.770
Michael, that's impressive.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.397
But, I mean, I'm a superior being, so...

22:38.024 --> 22:42.487
who has a lot to learn,
and who is grateful to be here.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.530
OK, reminder

22:44.697 --> 22:47.241
today Vicky is torturing Jason and Eleanor.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.953
You two should walk through the town square
in 30 minutes

22:50.995 --> 22:53.915
and remember to act surprised
when the unicorn poops on you.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.377
Right. Also, we don't know how long we have
before Vicky catches on

22:57.418 --> 22:58.461
so we really gotta move.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.047
As soon as you clean the glittery faeces
out of your hair

23:01.089 --> 23:04.258
meet back here for the next lesson.
- I mean, I can just come straight here.

23:04.425 --> 23:05.301
No.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.512
Go ahead and shower first.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.680
OK.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.810
Listen, we just wanted to thank you...
for all of your help.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.854
Our relationship's grown so much stronger
over the past few weeks

23:16.896 --> 23:19.107
and we owe it all to you.
- Congratulations.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.609
I am very happy for the both of you.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.197
OK, bye!

23:34.288 --> 23:35.164
Hi there.

23:35.415 --> 23:36.916
What's happening? What's wrong?

23:37.166 --> 23:38.042
I am wrong.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.003
I can't stop glitching.
I don't know why and it's getting worse.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.090
I fear this Neighbourhood is in danger
of total collapse.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.717
So, that's the main thing.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.760
How are you?
