Be back before then,

No change.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.290
It's not me,
it's my student.

10:16.290 --> 10:18.380
She just had a baby
and they're holding her on a 302

10:18.380 --> 10:19.580
and I need you
to get her out.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.750
Michaela:
This is Michaela Pratt.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.080
A text or e-mail
is preferred to voicemail.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.790
I tried calling you and Oli
40 times

10:26.790 --> 10:29.080
so I wouldn't have
to leave this on a voicemail,

10:29.080 --> 10:31.750
but here it is -- Laurel had the
baby in Annalise's elevator.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.250
They took her to St. Edith's.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.750
I just got here, but nobody
knows what happened to her.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.000
Call me back.

10:38.790 --> 10:41.500
-I don't know.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.210

before we tell the detectives

10:43.210 --> 10:44.250
a different story --

10:44.250 --> 10:45.790
You think
I don't understand that?

10:45.790 --> 10:47.330
You're the law student.

10:47.330 --> 10:48.920

what to do here.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.460

10:52.580 --> 10:54.210
Oh, God.

10:54.210 --> 10:56.830
What?

10:56.830 --> 10:58.380
He told them the truth.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.620
Hello?

11:11.620 --> 11:13.500
Nate! Hey.
You here to help me?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.420
Quiet.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.000
What the hell did you tell
the detective?

11:20.540 --> 11:23.500
My boss Tegan was giving
a speech when I went upstairs.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.040
I'd forgotten
if I had locked her office,

11:25.040 --> 11:26.170
so I just came to check --

11:26.170 --> 11:27.960
With your boyfriend
and Mr. Hampton?

11:27.960 --> 11:30.330
Just my boyfriend, but we ran
into Oliver in the bullpen.

11:30.330 --> 11:32.330
What the hell
is taking so long?

11:32.330 --> 11:33.750
So it was just
the three of you?

11:33.750 --> 11:36.170
Yes, until we saw Simon.

11:36.170 --> 11:38.250
He was all
jittery and panicked.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.790
I-I knew he was stressed
about his immigration status,

11:40.790 --> 11:42.750
but this was different.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.170
It's like he snapped.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.420
Hey, somebody better start
talking right now

11:45.420 --> 11:46.540
before I go tell Tegan.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.120
Simon was supposed
to be our fall guy,

11:48.120 --> 11:49.290
but he caught us.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.170
Laurel: Just name your price,
Simon.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.290
Tell me what's in that bag
first.

11:52.290 --> 11:54.120
We caught him coming
from the server room.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.380
No.
Okay.
Well, then, let me look.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.250
But he totally
freaked out.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.670
We tried to calm him down,
but then he pulled out the gun.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.250
No one even knew Laurel
had a gun.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.210
He just kept
waving it at us...

12:04.210 --> 12:06.420
You brought a gun into
a workplace!

12:06.420 --> 12:08.040
...trying to keep us back.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.420
So he was
threatening you?

12:09.420 --> 12:10.750
Just hear me out --

12:10.750 --> 12:12.290
Hey, back the hell
away from me!
Michaela: Hey!

12:12.290 --> 12:14.040
I don't think he wanted
to hurt anybody.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.670
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

12:15.670 --> 12:18.080
But he was so paranoid
that we caught him stealing

12:18.080 --> 12:19.500
whatever he was stealing.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.710
He clearly had been planning it
for a long time.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.580
Michaela tried to get him
to put it down.

12:23.580 --> 12:24.790
Please just put it down,
okay?

12:24.790 --> 12:25.790
He pointed the gun
at his head.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.210
Just, please, just --

12:27.210 --> 12:29.040
He said he'd rather die
than go to jail.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.790

of those wheelie chairs.
