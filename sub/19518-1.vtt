00:19.368 --> 00:21.399
Move along, sir.

00:37.948 --> 00:39.214
Hey!

00:39.215 --> 00:41.421
Hey! That's my car!

00:43.224 --> 00:46.033
This isn't funny, you crazy bitch.

00:46.034 --> 00:47.958
Are you gonna pay for that?!

01:09.234 --> 01:12.218
- Hold on, let me just...
- Nah. What for?

01:12.219 --> 01:14.320
Text your girlfriend?

01:14.321 --> 01:17.156
This Dwayne guy he's cute.

01:17.157 --> 01:20.526
But there's something scary about him.

01:20.527 --> 01:22.395
I think...

01:22.396 --> 01:25.184
I think I like it.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.666
I was at this party the other night...

01:27.667 --> 01:29.501
some girl had these
pills with turtles on 'em.

01:29.502 --> 01:31.896
Dumb bitch wouldn't tell
me where she got 'em.

01:32.238 --> 01:33.772
I bet you can tell me where she got 'em.

01:33.773 --> 01:34.968
Uh-huh...

01:36.441 --> 01:40.679
Maybe I want to keep you needing me.

01:41.180 --> 01:43.614
Guess I'll have to make
friends with someone else.

01:43.615 --> 01:44.997
Agh!

01:46.485 --> 01:48.153
I don't need this shit!

01:49.788 --> 01:51.356
Agh!

01:51.357 --> 01:52.590
I had a rough fucking night.

01:52.591 --> 01:53.691
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:53.692 --> 01:56.357
I didn't know you had a rough night.

01:58.062 --> 02:01.176
I don't wanna make
friends with anyone else,

02:01.201 --> 02:03.367
but you gotta hook me up.

02:03.368 --> 02:05.335
- Huh.
- Yeah.

02:08.145 --> 02:10.330
All right.

02:12.019 --> 02:13.699
Go.

02:13.724 --> 02:15.423
Ahhh.

02:22.353 --> 02:24.054
At the Rattlesnake.

02:24.055 --> 02:26.389
You ask for Rainmaker Jed.

02:27.192 --> 02:29.226
I'm gonna rip you apart.

02:34.264 --> 02:35.565
Hands on your fucking head!

02:35.566 --> 02:37.100
Don't move! Face down!

02:37.101 --> 02:38.735
- Hands on your head!
- Hands behind your back.

02:38.736 --> 02:40.612
Behind your back! Lock your thumbs.

02:40.637 --> 02:43.139
- Fuck off!
- Get dressed.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.108
- Don't fuckin' move!
- Go!

02:45.109 --> 02:46.342
Fuck off!

02:54.084 --> 02:55.937
You gotta be kidding.

02:55.962 --> 02:57.362
Fucking hell, Annie.

02:57.387 --> 02:58.955
The supplier wasn't coming. We waited.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.159
So you ditch me at the bar?

03:00.184 --> 03:01.885
She wanted to arrest him
in the bar for possession.

03:01.886 --> 03:03.286
Well, then at least we'd hold him.

03:03.287 --> 03:04.888
You gonna explain to the judge

03:04.889 --> 03:06.857
why you were half naked with
a rail of coke up your nose?

03:06.858 --> 03:08.458
Who cares about the
asshole from Thunder Bay?

03:08.459 --> 03:09.629
We wanted the supplier.

03:09.654 --> 03:11.855
- You got a name?
- Rainmaker Jed.

03:12.449 --> 03:14.701
He just got out of
Millhaven. He's from the Rez.

03:14.726 --> 03:16.018
He's small time.

03:16.042 --> 03:18.242
Well, maybe he's moving up.

03:20.804 --> 03:23.239
Way to make use of your tits.

03:23.591 --> 03:25.169
Okay...

03:39.946 --> 03:42.172
Can you come pick me up?

04:38.660 --> 04:41.413
It's a good day to be alive Bellevue.

04:41.452 --> 04:43.597
And congratulations go to, Daisy Ryder,

04:43.598 --> 04:45.098
for her contest winning slogan...

04:45.099 --> 04:48.068
"Bellevue: Where the Sun Always Rises."

04:48.286 --> 04:50.070
As a town we've taken hits,

04:50.071 --> 04:52.706
but Daisy reminds: out
of the dark moments,

04:52.707 --> 04:55.307
the sun will always shine again.

04:56.025 --> 04:57.992
That's not what I meant.

05:04.358 --> 05:07.022
Sarcasm. Like...

05:07.047 --> 05:08.988
it stops raining, eventually.

05:08.989 --> 05:11.524
Like the best thing that happens here

05:11.525 --> 05:14.493
is just a regular
occurrence anywhere else.

05:14.595 --> 05:17.163
I told you, you shoulda run for mayor.

05:18.765 --> 05:20.932
Don't go to school today, Daisy.

05:21.935 --> 05:24.002
He's out there again.

05:27.841 --> 05:29.775
These taste like glue.

05:29.978 --> 05:31.844
Don't eat them then.

05:31.845 --> 05:34.337
I liked you better when
you were a sweet little kid.

05:46.700 --> 05:47.960
I love you.

06:05.844 --> 06:07.617
Detective Ryder.

06:09.447 --> 06:11.515
Times are changing in our town.

06:11.516 --> 06:14.086
Mayor Mansfield, or Mother,
as you're locally known.

06:14.111 --> 06:16.954
What's with this Bellevue
'facelift' as you would call it?

06:16.955 --> 06:18.489
The mine's closed.

06:18.490 --> 06:19.924
We're in transition.

06:19.925 --> 06:23.360
The new brewery will be a
vital part of the new Bellevue.

06:23.361 --> 06:25.496
If the brewery does set up here,

06:25.497 --> 06:27.498
is it true that the
miners get all the jobs,

06:27.499 --> 06:28.965
and no one has a fair shot?

06:28.966 --> 06:30.901
Everyone will get a fair shot.

06:30.902 --> 06:32.603
Bellevue's just that kind of town.

06:32.604 --> 06:33.636
Sounds good.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.495
After some weather, we'll be right back.

06:36.945 --> 06:38.331
Your boss tell you to come see me?

06:38.356 --> 06:39.808
Yeah. I figured you
wanted to ream me out

06:39.833 --> 06:41.441
about not mowing my lawn.

06:41.466 --> 06:44.080
I heard about your motel
antics the other night.

06:44.081 --> 06:46.082
You got initiative.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.051
Whatever we been doing to
get these pills and lowlifes

06:48.052 --> 06:49.596
out of our town isn't working.

06:49.621 --> 06:52.155
So, you go with your gut and
I'll watch your back. Yeah?

06:52.156 --> 06:54.579
Does it come with a raise?

06:56.060 --> 06:57.860
Is your hair supposed to look like that?

06:57.861 --> 07:00.853
- Yeah... pretty much.
- No, no, no. I like it.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.443
Detective Ryder...

07:11.742 --> 07:13.209
What makes a town?

07:13.210 --> 07:16.812
For my retrospective
I picked Sandy Driver.

07:17.554 --> 07:20.049
Born in 1980. A Gemini.

07:20.050 --> 07:22.818
Died a murder victim. 1994.

07:22.819 --> 07:24.519
14-years-old.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.922
A good cop died
investigating that murder.

07:27.195 --> 07:28.395
I'd know.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.334
He was my grandpa.

07:31.093 --> 07:33.895
Today is the anniversary of his death.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.214
Sandy was killed because
people thought she was weird,

07:37.239 --> 07:39.634
crazy, half animal...

07:45.875 --> 07:48.209
Some believe her ghost possesses people.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.544
Sandy, the girl who was
supposed to be married

07:50.545 --> 07:52.247
in the Christmas Pageant,

07:52.272 --> 07:55.444
was found posed as the Virgin Mary.

07:55.469 --> 07:56.804
Strangled.

07:57.152 --> 07:58.819
I know what you want

07:58.820 --> 08:01.319
You can't go out there! I've seen them!

08:01.344 --> 08:03.524
I've seen all of them!
I know where they are.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.925
I know! Everyone knows it!

08:04.926 --> 08:06.858
And I know who you are!

08:06.883 --> 08:09.038
Sandy's dad never recovered.

08:09.063 --> 08:10.564
And the thing that they do to them.

08:10.565 --> 08:12.533
There's all things in there...

08:12.534 --> 08:15.356
Everybody is in there! Everybody!

08:15.615 --> 08:17.403
Mr. Driver,

08:17.435 --> 08:19.684
you wanna put down that stick?

08:20.841 --> 08:23.370
Everyone knows it.
They're going over there.

08:23.395 --> 08:24.829
Their all lined up.

08:24.854 --> 08:27.433
Hey. That's some good upper
body strength you've got there.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.230
Annie. Remember me?

08:29.255 --> 08:31.589
Looks like you're off your meds again.

08:31.601 --> 08:33.974
I don't know those
people. I don't know them.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.799
They're robots. They're robots.

08:35.825 --> 08:37.453
Robots! Scram!

08:37.455 --> 08:40.344
Yeah, scram! Scram!

08:51.784 --> 08:53.317
You're human.

08:53.318 --> 08:55.322
Thanks. You too.

08:55.845 --> 08:59.389
We were sad at the same
time. That's how I know.

09:00.550 --> 09:02.142
We're the same.

09:03.728 --> 09:05.329
Mind if I sit with you 'til our friends

09:05.330 --> 09:07.282
from the hospital get here?

09:16.674 --> 09:17.975
Driver okay?

09:17.976 --> 09:19.275
Yeah. They picked him up.

09:19.276 --> 09:21.078
Good. Meet me at the scrap yard.

09:21.079 --> 09:22.779
There is a missing kid.

09:22.780 --> 09:24.247
ETA about the extra officers.

09:24.248 --> 09:26.357
About 25 minutes.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.353
His mother called in,
reporting him missing at 6 A.M.

09:30.354 --> 09:32.622
Okay, let's spread out
and see what else we find.

09:32.623 --> 09:34.250
Everything in Bellevue changed

09:34.275 --> 09:37.093
after Sandy's shocking gruesome murder.

09:37.094 --> 09:38.828
Police started talking to everyone

09:38.829 --> 09:41.197
and the town stopped
trusting each other.

09:41.198 --> 09:43.334
Because the killer knew intimate details

09:43.359 --> 09:45.334
of the geography of our town,

09:45.335 --> 09:48.403
cops say he was local. One of us.

09:51.742 --> 09:53.609
Evil that was alive that night

09:53.610 --> 09:56.345
appeared to vanish into the air.

09:56.616 --> 09:59.079
Never to return.

10:59.541 --> 11:02.440
Jesus. You smell flammable.

11:02.911 --> 11:05.645
Isn't that like against
your religion or some shit?

11:05.646 --> 11:09.050
Five minutes in confession,
I'm as good as new.

11:10.268 --> 11:12.018
All right. Listen up.

11:12.019 --> 11:15.103
Scene was found by Ricky
Jordan who runs a scrap yard

11:15.128 --> 11:17.355
when he's not face
down in his own vomit.

11:17.535 --> 11:21.159
Ah, we found a jean
jacket, a cell and a bike.

11:21.184 --> 11:23.219
All confirmed by Maggie Sweetland

11:23.244 --> 11:25.926
to belong to her 16-year-old son, Jesse.

11:25.964 --> 11:27.832
Now, if you don't know who he is,

11:27.833 --> 11:28.968
you're living under a rock.

11:28.993 --> 11:31.628
He's our most ridiculously
talented hockey player.

11:31.653 --> 11:34.210
And he's into the make-up and the...

11:35.484 --> 11:37.208
Yes. Rumor has it he's...

11:37.209 --> 11:39.276
contemplating his gender identity.

11:39.277 --> 11:41.015
Openly?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.941
I wouldn't say openly, Virginia.

11:42.980 --> 11:44.981
But a kid came to his
house selling chocolate bars

11:44.982 --> 11:46.950
and walked in on him in his mom's dress.

11:46.951 --> 11:48.272
And then people found out about it.

11:48.297 --> 11:49.820
We also found a tooth.

11:49.821 --> 11:52.195
Ah shit. They got a game Friday.

11:53.828 --> 11:56.051
What? The kid probably took off.

11:56.076 --> 11:57.227
He's into weird shit.

11:57.228 --> 11:58.995
He probably went
looking for other people

11:58.996 --> 12:00.294
that were into it too.

12:00.319 --> 12:03.055
Ineloquently put, but yeah.

12:03.435 --> 12:06.424
Okay, you all have your
searching orders. Let's go.

12:06.449 --> 12:07.871
What about the porn?

12:07.872 --> 12:10.768
We found ripped magazine
pieces. Blood on one.

12:10.793 --> 12:12.526
Yeah, well, we don't
know those are connected.

12:12.527 --> 12:13.762
There's garbage everywhere, right?

12:13.787 --> 12:15.253
The other garbage was
old. This looked new.

12:15.278 --> 12:17.674
We'll do blood tests. But
there's no point in speculating

12:17.699 --> 12:19.132
until we know for sure.

12:19.157 --> 12:21.562
- Take the tooth to your cousin.
- Yeah.

12:21.587 --> 12:23.718
Dr. Allan, the dentist.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.812
I know you guys like to keep
things in the family but...

12:25.837 --> 12:27.170
Hockey.

12:27.195 --> 12:28.945
Jesse had his teeth
smashed out last year

12:28.961 --> 12:30.895
in this crazy game against Oaktown.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.811
If this is a crown, my cuz
can ID it, if it's his work.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.324
Five minutes to the dentist office

12:35.325 --> 12:36.749
versus four hours to the lab.

12:36.774 --> 12:38.260
Nice. Let's do it.

12:38.261 --> 12:39.461
Remember, keep it in perspective, right.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.683
Hockey players fight.
Teenagers run away.

12:41.708 --> 12:43.624
They don't disappear.

12:44.647 --> 12:46.613
Why go to the scrap yard
in the middle of the night?

12:46.638 --> 12:48.239
It's not a hangout.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.521
Brady knows a lot of kids

12:49.546 --> 12:51.547
being as he's on the same
intellectual level as them,

12:51.572 --> 12:53.206
so we'll see what he can get.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.379
Jesse's mom's still a mess.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.113
Keep at her.

13:02.855 --> 13:05.524
So how was your chat with the mayor?

13:05.549 --> 13:07.587
She just wants to keep her friends close

13:07.612 --> 13:09.540
and those she can't brainwash closer.

13:09.565 --> 13:10.794
Well, she's good for the town,

13:10.819 --> 13:13.021
but you make sure you stay
on the right side of her.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.666
Nice Intel on Rainmaker Jed,
by the way. It looks good.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.233
Can you get him on anything?

13:17.234 --> 13:18.757
Not yet.

13:23.007 --> 13:25.440
How is it with Virginia?

13:25.835 --> 13:28.536
She has people skills
of a cardboard box.

13:28.561 --> 13:31.116
Well, not everyone has
your sparkling personality.

13:31.141 --> 13:33.416
She's methodical.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.444
They loved her in Sudbury.

13:35.469 --> 13:37.218
Peter Welland.

13:37.788 --> 13:39.311
Hang on a second.

13:39.790 --> 13:41.990
Get out.

13:47.075 --> 13:48.443
We got a pedophile.

13:48.468 --> 13:50.265
Some guy called. Anonymous.

13:50.266 --> 13:52.801
Said that a sex offender
just moved up by the Rez.

13:52.802 --> 13:54.901
Been hanging out at the Rattlesnake.

13:59.912 --> 14:01.243
Got it.

14:08.779 --> 14:10.797
Can I get one of those?

14:33.799 --> 14:36.967
I got something on that
belongs to you, lady?

14:37.445 --> 14:39.831
Did you do that? I like it.

14:39.856 --> 14:41.612
You must be messed up then.

14:41.637 --> 14:44.092
I'd totally get a tattoo of that.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.051
Does that make me messed up?

14:46.076 --> 14:48.779
How's that ATM treating you, Officer?

14:48.857 --> 14:50.967
You are here as a customer, right?

14:53.806 --> 14:56.468
They may put up with
you on your off days,

14:57.631 --> 14:59.599
but there's a code.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.468
I'd watch out.

15:01.711 --> 15:04.513
You don't know if one of these
depraved assholes owes me a favor.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.732
I know your dirty little secret?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.509
Still luring children into vans?

15:09.510 --> 15:10.748
Why?

15:10.773 --> 15:12.521
Know any kids who need a ride?

15:12.546 --> 15:14.688
Where were you last night?

15:14.833 --> 15:16.837
Midnight bingo...

15:17.329 --> 15:18.937
on the Rez.

15:18.962 --> 15:20.594
Big winner.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.522
Where'd you get the busted knuckles?

15:22.523 --> 15:24.756
It gets a little competitive...

15:25.937 --> 15:27.502
Annie.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.359
How do you know my name?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.111
Says he can help with the missing kid.

15:48.201 --> 15:49.661
Hey!

15:49.686 --> 15:51.397
Hey!

16:35.796 --> 16:38.429
Annie, your dad is gone.

16:39.801 --> 16:42.608
It'll be okay. He'll
still watch you grow.

16:42.633 --> 16:45.067
He'll just do it from Heaven.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.993
"A cowboy rides into town on Friday.

17:40.994 --> 17:45.196
"Stays for three days
and leaves on Friday.

17:45.197 --> 17:47.431
"How did he do it?

17:50.469 --> 17:52.037
"Love, Dad.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.741
"PS. I need something
to remember you by.

17:54.766 --> 17:56.164
"Alfie?"

17:59.512 --> 18:02.379
"His horse was named Friday."

18:12.891 --> 18:14.725
"When someone else ate,

18:14.750 --> 18:16.455
"you became full of me.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.767
"What am I?"

18:18.997 --> 18:20.829
What did she eat?

18:20.854 --> 18:22.442
What does it mean?

18:22.467 --> 18:25.102
If I don't figure it out
Daddy will never come back!

18:25.103 --> 18:26.711
Stop reading that!

18:26.736 --> 18:28.606
It's not from your dad!

18:28.607 --> 18:30.240
You have to stop!

18:31.943 --> 18:34.044
Stop, Annie. Stop!

18:34.045 --> 18:35.477
Stop it, Annie!

18:35.502 --> 18:37.236
You're scaring me.

18:45.222 --> 18:47.255
"Find me where there is none."

18:49.929 --> 18:51.984
"You are my light.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.819
"Love, Dad."

19:03.627 --> 19:05.535
Pedophile had an alibi.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.842
You talk to him?

19:06.843 --> 19:09.085
The Tribal police has
him on security footage

19:09.110 --> 19:10.746
at late night bingo.

19:10.771 --> 19:12.291
Also, ah...

19:12.315 --> 19:15.048
Dr. Allan says the tooth was Jesse's.

19:15.138 --> 19:16.665
Shit.

19:19.171 --> 19:21.456
Remember those riddles
that I got when I was young?

19:21.457 --> 19:22.791
Of course I do.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.593
That messed you up really bad. Why?

19:24.594 --> 19:26.210
Did you ever get a lead on who sent them

19:26.235 --> 19:27.803
you never told me about?

19:28.007 --> 19:29.874
It was just some lying sicko

19:29.899 --> 19:31.810
using a tragedy to prey on you.

19:31.952 --> 19:33.857
And it wasn't your dead dad

19:33.882 --> 19:35.470
writing beyond the grave, either.

19:35.471 --> 19:37.639
- Where's this coming from?
- Nowhere.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.174
Do I need to be worried
about you, Annie?

19:39.175 --> 19:40.957
I mean, last night you're...

19:40.982 --> 19:42.964
you're high with a
drug dealer in a motel.

19:42.989 --> 19:45.624
I mean, I got a missing
kid. I need you focused.

19:45.681 --> 19:46.809
I am.

19:47.334 --> 19:48.850
My mind was just wandering.

19:48.851 --> 19:52.090
I guess it's the time of year.

19:53.668 --> 19:56.351
Yeah I know. The anniversary.

19:57.026 --> 19:58.592
I was gonna say something this morning,

19:58.593 --> 20:00.128
but with everything...

20:00.343 --> 20:01.863
20 fucking years without him.

20:01.864 --> 20:03.631
Doesn't fell like it. Does it?

20:03.632 --> 20:05.575
Am I like him? As a cop?

20:06.164 --> 20:08.043
Well, you're intuitive like him.

20:08.609 --> 20:10.504
And you're emotional like him.

20:10.505 --> 20:12.523
You're tough like me.

20:13.841 --> 20:15.909
Are we gonna find Jesse?

20:16.839 --> 20:18.279
Yeah.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.748
But you should get some sleep.

20:21.749 --> 20:23.793
We both know you look
like a crack addict

20:23.818 --> 20:26.271
- if you don't get your 8 hours.
- Not true.

20:26.296 --> 20:28.800
Annie. I've seriously seen
people try to sell you crack

20:28.825 --> 20:31.497
after a late one, okay. Good night.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.044
She's in the closet again, Dad.

20:58.118 --> 21:00.385
I'm trying to cut down, remember.

21:10.286 --> 21:12.956
I'm just... No. I'm just saying that...

21:12.981 --> 21:14.503
herpes is permanent.

21:14.528 --> 21:16.027
It's way more binding than marriage.

21:16.052 --> 21:19.255
And if we had it we
might still live together.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.948
You keep trying to sell
me on the herpes thing,

21:20.973 --> 21:22.669
I'm gonna think you have it.

21:27.605 --> 21:30.151
I thought you were getting off those?

21:30.827 --> 21:32.839
My back's been acting up again.

21:32.911 --> 21:35.030
You getting any work from Mark?

21:37.319 --> 21:39.460
There's just no work.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.017
Maybe the brewery.

21:42.471 --> 21:44.938
You have to make things,
that's what you love.

21:45.756 --> 21:47.851
There's a guy I know, uh,

21:47.876 --> 21:50.538
makes custom furniture.
He's wants to branch out.

21:50.563 --> 21:51.917
Hey, why not?

21:51.942 --> 21:53.595
You, you already have those skills.

21:53.596 --> 21:56.837
I got those skills like I
built Daisy a shitty dollhouse.

21:56.862 --> 21:59.221
It was a prefect dollhouse,

21:59.362 --> 22:01.658
and I can tell you want to do it.

22:02.077 --> 22:04.238
Yeah, I kinda do.

22:05.103 --> 22:07.504
Thanks for coming and
getting me last night.

22:07.772 --> 22:10.211
Why you gotta be so crazy at work?

22:10.436 --> 22:12.898
Maybe it's all I've got going for me.

22:18.716 --> 22:20.902
Do you wanna kiss my face?

22:24.388 --> 22:27.024
Too late. Offer rescinded.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.337
What's this?

22:44.341 --> 22:46.909
"When somebody else ate,
you became full of me.

22:46.910 --> 22:48.454
"What am I?"

22:49.413 --> 22:51.299
It's original sin.

22:51.806 --> 22:54.236
I got that when I learned
about Eve and the apple.

22:55.186 --> 22:57.463
Could never figure out the rest.

22:57.921 --> 23:00.089
"Find me where there is none?

23:00.090 --> 23:02.537
"Where is there no original sin?"

23:02.562 --> 23:04.072
With you.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.602
You're perfect.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.867
How can you not love that guy?

23:13.055 --> 23:15.189
He's the one who left.

23:15.705 --> 23:18.297
He'd come back if you told him to.

23:18.641 --> 23:21.375
Hmm. Probably wouldn't
be a good idea for him.

23:21.844 --> 23:23.719
Probably not.

23:25.594 --> 23:28.115
I was only two years older
than you when I met him.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.754
Oh my God! You're about
to go through so much shit.

23:32.755 --> 23:33.824
Are you prepared?

23:33.849 --> 23:36.268
What if a guy wants to
stick his hand up your shirt?

23:36.293 --> 23:38.093
Five bucks please.

23:38.094 --> 23:39.293
Don't have sex.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.029
But then you won't have any grandkids

23:41.030 --> 23:42.998
unless I immaculately conceive them.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.080
That's not actually what it means.

23:44.105 --> 23:45.814
People think immaculate conception

23:45.839 --> 23:48.244
is Mary getting pregnant
without having sex.

23:48.269 --> 23:49.369
But it's not.

23:49.394 --> 23:52.827
It's that she herself was
conceived without original sin.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.479
That's where there is none!

23:59.516 --> 24:01.594
With Mary and...

24:01.828 --> 24:03.992
her immaculate conception.

24:04.196 --> 24:05.531
Um...

24:06.151 --> 24:08.375
can you stay with your dad?

24:25.326 --> 24:27.137
_

25:27.766 --> 25:30.300
Nature calling.

25:30.301 --> 25:32.879
Nature calling.

25:32.904 --> 25:35.106
Nature calling.

25:35.107 --> 25:36.837
Jesus calling.

25:36.862 --> 25:38.797
Jesus calling.

25:40.979 --> 25:43.212
Jesus calling.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.275
- Jesus...
- Who is this?

25:46.417 --> 25:48.818
Nature calling.

25:49.222 --> 25:51.487
Jesus calling.

25:51.512 --> 25:54.652
- Nature calling.
- Jesus calling.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.722
- Nature calling.
- Jesus calling.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.941
Nature calling.

26:23.994 --> 26:25.294
Hey! Hey, you can't do this!

26:25.295 --> 26:27.230
- Who gave you the note?
- I didn't see him.

26:27.231 --> 26:29.399
I was here, in a stall.
He gave me 50 bucks!

26:29.400 --> 26:30.833
What did he say about Jesse?

26:30.834 --> 26:32.868
That he could help. That's it!

26:32.869 --> 26:35.694
If you're lying, I'll fucking drown you.

26:39.636 --> 26:40.809
Get out!

26:47.017 --> 26:49.116
Crime stoppers.

26:50.237 --> 26:52.088
It's a teen hangout.

26:53.256 --> 26:55.713
I partied here back in the day.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.830
We did Sandy Driver séances.

26:58.986 --> 27:00.862
Kids hear Jesse's missing.

27:00.863 --> 27:03.998
Um, crazy Driver hangs out here too.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.461
We should take it seriously.

27:06.586 --> 27:07.813
Hey.

27:08.078 --> 27:10.374
Someone called in a tip. Anonymous.

27:10.399 --> 27:13.344
Thought it might be relevant
to Jesse. And then we see this.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.813
And also this.

27:17.797 --> 27:19.213
- Can you take a picture?
- Yeah.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.600
There's another one over here. See.

27:21.625 --> 27:22.984
_

27:35.375 --> 27:38.024
- It's Jesse.
- It took work.

27:38.049 --> 27:39.953
Paint's still fresh.

27:40.935 --> 27:42.623
It's a message.

27:43.204 --> 27:45.576
Religious figure beckoning...

27:45.787 --> 27:48.141
towards the side that's male.

27:48.381 --> 27:50.904
Could be the person who put it here...

27:50.929 --> 27:52.632
did something to Jesse.

27:52.658 --> 27:54.359
Saw something.

27:54.638 --> 27:56.652
Okay. Process it. And
get it out of here.

27:56.677 --> 27:59.037
It's from the Nativity scene.

28:04.090 --> 28:05.826
Trans...

28:06.537 --> 28:08.716
versus religion?

28:08.779 --> 28:10.443
Jesse religious?

28:10.512 --> 28:12.334
Maybe caught in the middle.

28:21.088 --> 28:23.168
You're here about...?

28:24.945 --> 28:27.013
Jesse Sweetland.

28:27.511 --> 28:30.086
- You know him?
- A little.

28:30.111 --> 28:32.213
I'm quite the hockey fan.

28:32.238 --> 28:33.785
He religious?

28:33.786 --> 28:35.452
Ever come to church?

28:36.217 --> 28:37.222
You sure?

28:37.223 --> 28:39.158
You don't get the sense that
he's religious in any way?

28:39.159 --> 28:41.193
Maybe torn between God and his nature.

28:41.194 --> 28:42.827
Oh, for Pete's sake.

28:43.350 --> 28:45.592
He's a boy from a troubled home.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.661
If he wears a dress,
it's a cry for help.

28:47.662 --> 28:49.262
But not the church's help?

28:49.263 --> 28:51.297
I'm just trying to
get the whole picture.

28:51.298 --> 28:53.333
You have a problem with religion.

28:53.334 --> 28:55.201
I don't have a problem with the church.

28:55.202 --> 28:58.504
Heh. You threw a rock
through that window

28:58.529 --> 29:00.254
my first year as priest here.

29:00.279 --> 29:02.208
I was thirteen. I thought
you were supposed to call out

29:02.209 --> 29:03.576
everything you thought was full of shit.

29:04.678 --> 29:06.044
And now?

29:06.045 --> 29:07.786
I'm less brave.

29:07.811 --> 29:09.081
If you'll excuse me,

29:09.082 --> 29:11.574
I'm meeting up with a search party.

29:20.014 --> 29:22.879
Hey. You find Jesse yet?

29:22.904 --> 29:25.204
We're doing everything we can.

29:25.952 --> 29:28.153
You noticed anything
off about him lately?

29:28.496 --> 29:31.550
Saw him toss his make-up and
that in the trash a week ago.

29:31.575 --> 29:33.943
His mother confide in you
about his experimentation?

29:33.944 --> 29:36.512
I saw him buy an eye shadow kit.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.121
Sure wasn't for Maggie.

29:38.146 --> 29:40.545
Cost twenty bucks and he tossed it.

29:41.748 --> 29:44.075
Stopped wearing Maggie's dresses too.

29:49.613 --> 29:50.808
He got so many trophies

29:50.833 --> 29:53.198
we thought we'd had
to buy a bigger house.

30:09.179 --> 30:11.857
Things been tough since
Jesse's dad was killed?

30:11.858 --> 30:13.692
He left us enough gambling debt

30:13.693 --> 30:15.794
we won't see a dime in benefits.

30:15.795 --> 30:18.597
How did Jesse take his father's death?

30:18.730 --> 30:20.833
Like a kid whose dad died.

30:20.834 --> 30:23.100
Any behavioral changes?

30:25.705 --> 30:27.113
You mean did he start drinking,

30:27.138 --> 30:28.440
thinking about killing himself,

30:28.465 --> 30:30.471
knocking out his own tooth?

30:30.665 --> 30:32.243
'Cause I live in a cheap house, right?

30:32.277 --> 30:34.244
He musta been on drugs?

30:34.269 --> 30:36.949
Maggie, did he take up
with the church in any way?

30:37.223 --> 30:38.650
Religion wasn't our thing.

30:38.651 --> 30:40.585
Could have come to it on his own?

30:40.586 --> 30:42.754
When you're lost you look for things.

30:42.755 --> 30:44.848
Not everyone turns to booze and sex.

30:44.873 --> 30:47.601
Sober five years before my husband died.

30:47.626 --> 30:49.727
I'm 28 and my daughter's 12.

30:49.728 --> 30:53.574
So... some of us turn to booze and sex.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.223
Shit.

30:57.255 --> 31:00.353
He had ah, I noticed
last couple of days...

31:00.378 --> 31:01.838
this, ah, burn.

31:01.839 --> 31:05.433
Like a T or a cross, maybe.

31:06.154 --> 31:08.181
What did he say about it?

31:09.908 --> 31:11.681
You didn't ask about it?

31:11.682 --> 31:13.583
He did a lot I didn't ask about.

31:13.584 --> 31:16.809
Cali next door said that he
stopped with the feminine thing

31:16.834 --> 31:19.033
about a week ago. What happened there?

31:20.604 --> 31:22.492
I don't know anything else to help.

31:22.493 --> 31:24.860
See, I'm feeling like you do

31:24.861 --> 31:27.399
and I'm racking my brain.

31:27.424 --> 31:29.298
But I can't imagine why
a mother would hold back

31:29.299 --> 31:31.366
when her kid was missing.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.768
That's a heap of judgment coming

31:32.769 --> 31:34.954
from someone whose husband
pops up around these parts

31:34.979 --> 31:37.180
looking for ways to relieve his pain.

31:38.910 --> 31:41.247
You can see yourselves out.

31:46.782 --> 31:48.684
It's not gonna work every time.

31:48.685 --> 31:51.241
You're going to meet people
who can see through you.

31:51.266 --> 31:53.703
- Who you can't charm.
- Is that you?

31:54.081 --> 31:56.367
You've only been here four months.

32:04.304 --> 32:07.617
Jesse burned a cross
into his palm. Recently.

32:07.642 --> 32:09.570
And he stopped wearing
dresses before he went missing.

32:09.571 --> 32:10.949
Where's you get that?

32:10.974 --> 32:12.541
Maggie. I think it's relevant.

32:12.708 --> 32:15.107
- Yeah. Put it on the wall.
- The what?

32:26.249 --> 32:27.521
Virginia?

32:27.522 --> 32:31.657
Make sense now, why I hired
the cardboard box, smart ass?

32:34.756 --> 32:37.258
Anything from the religious figures?

32:37.973 --> 32:39.617
Ah, tons of prints.

32:39.731 --> 32:41.201
But they've been there for years.

32:41.202 --> 32:43.536
Pissed on. You name it.

32:44.911 --> 32:46.406
Phones?

32:46.407 --> 32:48.114
No, they're clean.

32:48.139 --> 32:50.209
Nothing from the numbers.

32:51.445 --> 32:55.310
If he's religious, if that's
what the cross is for...

32:55.904 --> 32:57.638
could be motive for whatever happened.

32:57.680 --> 33:01.185
Religious freaks might not like
sharing their God with a trans kid.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.353
Is that what Father J. told you?

33:04.378 --> 33:07.112
He couldn't even decide
if he knew him or not.

33:07.113 --> 33:08.914
He was jumpy.

33:08.915 --> 33:11.581
He was wanting to put distance
between Jesse and the church.

33:13.231 --> 33:14.526
Yeah.

33:14.551 --> 33:16.245
Thanks.

33:18.696 --> 33:20.250
All right, so what
does porn and religion

33:20.275 --> 33:22.043
have to do with each other?

33:22.229 --> 33:24.242
Because the blood is Jesse's.

33:26.944 --> 33:28.980
Maybe the cross isn't religion.

33:29.151 --> 33:30.918
Is it an X?

33:31.537 --> 33:33.121
Cross dressing?

33:33.375 --> 33:35.109
What if it's not porn?

33:35.134 --> 33:37.202
What if it's female body parts?

33:37.227 --> 33:38.636
As in...

33:39.115 --> 33:41.731
how Jesse felt inside.

33:41.756 --> 33:43.489
What's with the Shepherd boy?

33:43.505 --> 33:45.121
Chief Welland, line 1.

33:45.146 --> 33:46.780
I'll be right back.

34:27.109 --> 34:28.849
You okay?

34:31.360 --> 34:33.600
Just bringing back bad memories.

34:37.908 --> 34:40.166
Just having another look.

34:54.534 --> 34:56.179
Ow!

35:08.773 --> 35:10.883
I wanna thank you all
for coming out tonight

35:10.884 --> 35:12.584
and showing your support.

35:12.585 --> 35:16.155
We will find Jesse and bring him home.

35:16.562 --> 35:18.199
And Friday night,

35:18.224 --> 35:21.893
when the season starts, we
will crush those Hornets!

35:56.036 --> 35:58.470
I hate that woman.

36:02.434 --> 36:04.682
I'm sorry I pushed.

36:05.166 --> 36:06.604
It's your kid.

36:06.605 --> 36:08.783
He took a lot of shit,

36:09.947 --> 36:11.475
but I never said anything about it.

36:11.476 --> 36:13.442
Because I wanted him,

36:14.301 --> 36:17.044
I wanted things to be easy for him.

36:17.215 --> 36:18.896
Play hockey,

36:18.921 --> 36:20.973
live in a nice house.

36:22.186 --> 36:25.155
But that night he asked
how I felt about it,

36:25.463 --> 36:28.167
about him feeling like a girl

36:28.192 --> 36:30.959
and it all changed.

36:32.764 --> 36:35.949
I said if you're happy, I'm happy.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.569
So it's all my fault,

36:39.570 --> 36:41.870
whatever happens.

36:44.642 --> 36:47.419
I'd quit drinking if he came back.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.735
Me too.

36:50.732 --> 36:53.021
I'll bring him back.

36:53.349 --> 36:55.217
Thank you again for coming everyone!

36:55.218 --> 36:58.916
Remember we are a strong community.

36:59.221 --> 37:01.041
- Where's your dad?
- When you go home,

37:01.066 --> 37:03.166
pray for Jesse tonight.

37:07.369 --> 37:08.797
I gotta go.

37:09.416 --> 37:10.699
I'm gonna help clear up.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.245
Remember Briana.

37:12.270 --> 37:13.893
Brady's sister.

37:14.098 --> 37:16.158
Daisy can help too.

37:16.324 --> 37:17.994
I'll take Daisy.

37:20.176 --> 37:22.510
I think your dad has a crush.

37:22.511 --> 37:25.246
He'll only ditch her when
we need him to fix something.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.474
Daisy, I got a call from Mr. Terry.

37:33.804 --> 37:35.737
Sandy Driver?

37:36.578 --> 37:39.088
He said he thought you had a fixation.

37:39.510 --> 37:40.845
You never talk about it

37:40.870 --> 37:43.130
so I had to find out for myself.

37:43.338 --> 37:45.265
It's part of my life too, you know.

37:45.266 --> 37:48.268
The last thing she saw was a monster.

37:48.455 --> 37:51.467
Then I was a kid that
knew there were monsters.

37:51.620 --> 37:54.174
It changes how you grow.

37:54.175 --> 37:56.875
I didn't want you to have to know that.

37:57.298 --> 37:59.967
And Grandpa.

38:00.281 --> 38:01.748
It broke him.

38:01.749 --> 38:04.217
He couldn't figure out who did it.

38:04.218 --> 38:06.452
He caught a bad one and it killed him.

38:06.453 --> 38:09.355
What if Jesse is a bad one?

38:09.683 --> 38:11.423
Driver's out again, Ryder.

38:11.448 --> 38:12.540
We're all busy.

38:12.565 --> 38:14.485
Besides, you know you're
the only one he likes.

38:14.510 --> 38:16.314
Jesus, again?

38:16.339 --> 38:18.130
Like Sandy's dad?

38:18.131 --> 38:20.023
He's off his meds.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.632
All right. Where is he?

38:21.633 --> 38:24.102
- Old church.
- Are you serious?

38:24.103 --> 38:26.195
Mr. Driver!

38:31.901 --> 38:33.885
Oh Jesus.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.984
Mr. Driver, are you hurt?

38:46.989 --> 38:48.721
Mr. Driver?

39:52.624 --> 39:54.060
Annie?

39:54.757 --> 39:57.388
- It's paint.
- What's that?

39:59.155 --> 40:01.196
Annie? Hello?

40:01.197 --> 40:03.928
What if I've been looking
at this from the wrong angle.

40:04.672 --> 40:08.436
It's not that he's religious,
wanted religion that...

40:09.147 --> 40:11.139
religion wouldn't let him be.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.305
Like he was bound.

40:13.695 --> 40:15.377
He couldn't escape.

40:20.289 --> 40:22.525
Well then, what's the
cross in the scenario?

40:22.550 --> 40:24.555
Maybe branding?

40:27.456 --> 40:29.969
The fence is electric. It's not a cross.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.579
It's an imprint of the fence.

40:31.604 --> 40:33.637
You'd have to hold his
hand there for a long time.

40:33.662 --> 40:35.162
Or somebody else held it there.

40:35.163 --> 40:36.840
- Be a hell of a shock.
- It's a thing.

40:36.865 --> 40:38.356
Electric shocking the gay out.

40:38.381 --> 40:40.244
Maybe they do it for trans too.

40:40.269 --> 40:43.005
The porn is female body parts,
right? What Jesse wanted.

40:43.030 --> 40:45.606
It's a, it's a freaky religious thing.

40:45.631 --> 40:48.175
Ah, showing images, things
you want that you shouldn't.

40:48.176 --> 40:50.754
- Then putting you through pain.
- Conversion therapy.

40:50.779 --> 40:52.413
We should check the fence for DNA.

40:52.438 --> 40:53.872
Annie?

40:55.471 --> 40:57.291
You there?

41:09.631 --> 41:11.077
Mom?

41:44.676 --> 41:46.666
Daisy!

41:46.992 --> 41:48.877
Daisy! It's Mom! Open up.

41:48.902 --> 41:50.125
It's Mom.

41:51.821 --> 41:53.998
- Who was he?!
- Who?

41:54.023 --> 41:56.041
- The man!
- There's no one here, baby.

41:56.042 --> 41:58.132
Then who wrote that?

42:07.117 --> 42:09.859
_

42:13.225 --> 42:15.259
This is Annie Ryder,
is this the psych ward?

42:15.260 --> 42:17.111
Did anyone call the
station about Mr. Driver?

42:17.136 --> 42:19.354
I want to go!

42:19.379 --> 42:20.939
Now!

42:50.163 --> 42:51.842
I'm sorry.

42:52.191 --> 42:54.572
I'm so so sorry.

42:58.683 --> 43:01.243
Can you take me to Dad's?
