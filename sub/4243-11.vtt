WEBVTT

00:00.177 --> 00:01.677
<i>So here's what you missed on</i> Glee:

00:01.712 --> 00:03.738
<i>The New Directions! lost</i>
<i>to the Warblers at Sectionals</i>

00:03.764 --> 00:05.464
<i>when Marley collapsed</i>
<i>in the middle of the show...</i>

00:05.490 --> 00:07.091
The New Directions!
are finished.

00:07.125 --> 00:08.125
<i>...so Sue</i>
<i>took over the choir room,</i>

00:08.159 --> 00:09.293
<i>and now the Glee Club's homeless.</i>

00:09.327 --> 00:11.662
<i>Puck went back to Lima</i>
<i>after striking out in L.A.,</i>

00:11.696 --> 00:13.297
<i>and he and Jake used</i>
<i>to just be half-brothers,</i>

00:13.331 --> 00:14.832
<i>but now they're, like, bros.</i>

00:14.866 --> 00:16.500
<i>Jake and Marley are almost an item,</i>

00:16.534 --> 00:18.102
<i>and Kurt got a surprise</i>
<i>audition to NYADA,</i>

00:18.136 --> 00:19.670
<i>and he totally got in.</i>

00:19.704 --> 00:21.835
<i>That's what you missed on</i> Glee.

00:25.049 --> 00:26.783
I'm telling you,
it's been keeping me up at night.

00:26.817 --> 00:28.818
<i>Something weird's going on</i>
<i>with the Warblers.</i>

00:28.852 --> 00:30.653
They're doing all those weird
flips and superhuman jumps

00:30.688 --> 00:32.188
at Sectionals.
Exactly, that's why they won.

00:32.222 --> 00:33.523
And where was Roundfaced Warbler?

00:33.557 --> 00:35.224
You said he was there
when you went back to Dalton,

00:35.259 --> 00:36.559
but come Sectionals, poof, he's gone.

00:36.594 --> 00:37.560
So, what are you saying?

00:37.595 --> 00:38.828
I think they cheated at Sectionals.

00:38.862 --> 00:40.496
Sam, you can't make
accusations like that

00:40.531 --> 00:41.564
without any kind of evidence.

00:41.599 --> 00:44.000
Well, then, I'll find some evidence.

00:44.034 --> 00:46.336
Do you have any lip balm I can use?

00:46.370 --> 00:47.681
What?

00:47.716 --> 00:50.551
Conspiracy theories make my lips
get all chapped.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.153
Come on dude, it's not weird.
We're like brothers.

00:52.187 --> 00:54.422
Yeah, um, sure.

00:54.456 --> 00:56.691
Here you go.
Thank you.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.526
Mmm.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.593
Guys?

00:59.628 --> 01:01.362
You're late.
I know.

01:01.396 --> 01:03.030
It's not...

01:03.065 --> 01:05.498
This meeting of the
McKinley High Student Council

01:05.534 --> 01:06.667
is now in session.

01:06.702 --> 01:07.668
First order of business:

01:07.703 --> 01:08.936
Secretary Cohen-Chang,

01:08.971 --> 01:10.371
will you please read the minutes
from last meeting?

01:10.405 --> 01:12.773
Sam did a Daniel Craig
impression for 45 minutes.

01:12.808 --> 01:14.608
I'll have it shaken and stirred, too.

01:14.643 --> 01:15.710
That was fantastic.

01:15.744 --> 01:17.712
Thank you,
Secretary Cohen-Chang.

01:17.746 --> 01:19.447
Treasurer Motta, uh,
if we could go through

01:19.481 --> 01:21.882
the budget appropriations
we were talking about last...

01:21.917 --> 01:23.117
Yes, Tina?

01:23.151 --> 01:26.120
It is now officially
142 days until Prom,

01:26.154 --> 01:28.055
where all the hot girls
get immediately snatched up

01:28.090 --> 01:29.223
by all the hot guys,

01:29.257 --> 01:30.224
then the sort of hot girls

01:30.258 --> 01:31.892
get asked out by the sort of hot guys,

01:31.927 --> 01:34.228
and then all the rest of us
have to sit around and wait

01:34.262 --> 01:37.531
for all the nerds and the freaks
and the burn-outs and the losers

01:37.566 --> 01:39.367
to work up some courage and ask us out

01:39.401 --> 01:41.902
to the most awkward night
of heavy petting we're likely

01:41.937 --> 01:43.904
to get till we wake up
in a nursing home

01:43.939 --> 01:45.106
getting groped by an orderly.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.407
Okay, well, the record,

01:46.441 --> 01:48.242
I think you're totally sort of hot.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.777
Like, if I was, like,
in a bunker with you,

01:49.811 --> 01:50.778
I would totally hit that.

01:50.812 --> 01:52.546
Tina, what are you suggesting?

01:52.581 --> 01:54.615
I propose the First Annual

01:54.649 --> 01:56.283
McKinley High Sadie Hawkins Dance.

01:57.352 --> 01:58.386
It's what you call a dance

01:58.420 --> 01:59.553
where the girls ask the guys.

01:59.588 --> 02:01.655
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

02:01.690 --> 02:02.723
Why not?

02:02.758 --> 02:03.891
It was the topic of discussion

02:03.925 --> 02:05.059
at the last meeting of the.

02:05.093 --> 02:06.260
"Too Young to Be Bitter Club."

02:07.829 --> 02:09.096
Ever since I dated Puckerman,

02:09.131 --> 02:10.798
no one will ask me to a dance.

02:10.832 --> 02:12.733
I think everyone assumes
you have herpes.

02:12.768 --> 02:15.302
No one asks me to dances
'cause I have such clammy hands.

02:15.337 --> 02:17.238
I'm a hot piece of ass

02:17.272 --> 02:18.806
and I want to shake

02:18.840 --> 02:20.341
this sweet thing on a dance floor.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.209
Ba-bam.

02:26.014 --> 02:28.649
Becky is right, if I understood
what she said correctly.

02:28.683 --> 02:31.285
Why are the guys so empowered
to ask us to a dance

02:31.319 --> 02:32.953
when we just have to sit around
and wait?

02:32.988 --> 02:36.590
Wouldn't it be great
if we got to choose?

02:36.625 --> 02:38.426
All in favor of a dance
where the girls ask the guys...

02:38.460 --> 02:39.827
W-Wait...

02:39.861 --> 02:40.961
wait, wait a second.
Hold on just one...

02:40.996 --> 02:41.996
It's official.

02:42.030 --> 02:43.464
Get ready for the first annual

02:43.498 --> 02:45.299
McKinley High Sadie Hawkins Dance.

02:52.474 --> 02:54.108
<i>My first week at NYADA,</i>

02:54.142 --> 02:56.110
<i>and the most surprising thing</i>
<i>about college</i>

02:56.144 --> 02:58.546
<i>is it's just like high school.</i>

02:58.580 --> 02:59.947
<i>It's all about the cliques.</i>

02:59.981 --> 03:01.348
<i>The stage combat majors are the jocks.</i>

03:01.383 --> 03:03.484
<i>Classical acting majors are the preps.</i>

03:03.518 --> 03:05.219
<i>The ballerinas are the mean girls,</i>

03:05.253 --> 03:06.987
<i>and if they're at the top</i>
<i>of the social pyramid,</i>

03:07.022 --> 03:08.823
<i>then, once again,</i>

03:08.857 --> 03:11.392
<i>I'm at the bottom.</i>

03:11.426 --> 03:12.993
<i>I assumed Rachel and I</i>
<i>would be as inseparable</i>

03:13.028 --> 03:14.662
<i>as the twins in</i> Side Show,

03:14.696 --> 03:16.063
<i>but she's always rushing off</i>
<i>to help Brody</i>

03:16.098 --> 03:17.898
<i>with something that</i>
<i>requires him to be shirtless.</i>

03:17.933 --> 03:20.167
All right, Brody has an <i>The Musical,</i>

03:20.202 --> 03:21.702
so I'm gonna go help him.
I'll see you at home later.

03:21.736 --> 03:23.070
And I love you. Mwah.

03:23.105 --> 03:24.872
<i>The truth is this guy needs</i>

03:24.906 --> 03:26.173
<i>to start making new friends,</i>

03:26.208 --> 03:27.741
<i>and just like in high school,</i>

03:27.776 --> 03:30.311
<i>the best way to do that</i>
<i>is extracurriculars.</i>

03:30.345 --> 03:33.214
<i>Let's see, the Elizabethan Society,</i>

03:33.248 --> 03:34.882
<i>the Grand Guignol Club,</i>

03:34.916 --> 03:38.486
<i>the Tennessee Williams</i>
<i>Play Reading Group, and...</i>

03:38.520 --> 03:39.920
What's Adam's Apples?

03:39.955 --> 03:41.188
NYADA's show choir;
You should join.

03:41.223 --> 03:43.057
It's super fun.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.501
I feel totally powerless.

03:53.535 --> 03:56.170
Okay, any second any girl
could just come up and ask us

03:56.204 --> 03:59.273
to the dance, and it will
be very hard to say no.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.008
Or worse, no one asks us at all.

04:01.042 --> 04:03.077
This must be what the girls
feel like all the time.

04:03.111 --> 04:04.445
It is.

04:09.451 --> 04:11.752
Whoo!

04:11.786 --> 04:13.888
Hey, Finn, want to arm wrestle?

04:13.922 --> 04:15.289
It'll really get your blood flowing.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.757
Not today, Coach.

04:16.791 --> 04:18.959
Anyone?

04:18.994 --> 04:21.629
Hey, pumpkin, I heard about Sue
taking over your choir room.

04:21.663 --> 04:23.531
I'm really sorry about that.

04:23.565 --> 04:25.900
Yeah, yeah, it's been pretty rough.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.568
I feel like we're the Fugees
or something,

04:27.602 --> 04:29.436
just bouncing around
from available classroom

04:29.471 --> 04:30.604
to available classroom.

04:30.639 --> 04:32.873
You... wait, you mean
like refugees?

04:32.908 --> 04:34.975
Yeah. I mean, it's great we're
still together as a group,

04:35.010 --> 04:37.978
but without competitions,
I have to come up

04:38.013 --> 04:39.947
with something fun and
interesting on a weekly basis

04:39.981 --> 04:41.749
just to keep everybody involved,

04:41.783 --> 04:43.751
and this week I'm just stuck.
It's a no-brainer.

04:43.785 --> 04:45.486
The Sadie Hawkins Dance.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.454
Well, no offense, but how
am I supposed to make a lesson

04:47.489 --> 04:48.789
out of a dumb school dance?

04:48.823 --> 04:49.924
When I was in high school,

04:49.958 --> 04:51.091
girls like me didn't get asked out.

04:51.126 --> 04:52.426
So the only dance I could go to

04:52.460 --> 04:53.561
was Sadie Hawkins.

04:53.595 --> 04:55.563
I asked the preacher's son.

04:55.597 --> 04:57.998
He was stoned the whole time,
but we had a ball.

04:58.033 --> 04:59.567
Going to that dance gave me the courage

04:59.601 --> 05:01.835
and the confidence
to join the football team.

05:01.870 --> 05:04.238
I was the first girl
in Missouri to ever do it.

05:04.272 --> 05:06.273
Sadie Hawkins

05:06.308 --> 05:07.975
is a metaphor for empowerment,

05:08.009 --> 05:09.076
and not just for women,

05:09.110 --> 05:10.611
but for everyone

05:10.645 --> 05:12.980
who is sick and tired
of the status quo.

05:17.319 --> 05:18.686
I want to sit under Venus.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.154
I want to sit under Uranus.

05:20.188 --> 05:22.223
What's so funny?

05:24.226 --> 05:26.360
So this week in Glee Club,
it's ladies' choice,

05:26.394 --> 05:27.928
inspired by the Sadie Hawkins Dance.

05:27.963 --> 05:29.196
Which I thought of.

05:29.231 --> 05:30.264
It was my idea.

05:30.298 --> 05:31.465
Yes, thank you, Tina.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.934
And every girl will sing to whoever

05:33.969 --> 05:35.169
they want to take to the dance.

05:35.203 --> 05:37.871
Well, I, for one, love this lesson.

05:37.906 --> 05:39.840
I've got a song I want
to sing to somebody.

05:43.144 --> 05:45.379
♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪

05:45.413 --> 05:47.181
♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪

05:47.215 --> 05:48.315
Kurt, he's still sleeping.

05:48.350 --> 05:49.617
♪ Would you like some tea? ♪

05:49.651 --> 05:51.552
Yes, I would, but shh.

05:51.586 --> 05:52.886
Yes.
Brody's here?

05:52.921 --> 05:54.188
Did he spend the night?

05:54.222 --> 05:56.557
Yeah. We had dinner
last night at Balthazar,

05:56.591 --> 05:58.392
and he insisted on taking me home.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.128
Rachel. You know, the train ride
back to Manhattan's really long,

06:01.162 --> 06:03.030
so I just invited him to stay over.

06:03.064 --> 06:06.400
Oh, Rachel Berry, I am scandalized.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.801
Well, I just...
I seized the moment.

06:07.836 --> 06:09.503
I really, I like him,

06:09.537 --> 06:11.071
and I'm tired of second-guessing
something that feels so right.

06:11.106 --> 06:13.073
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

06:13.108 --> 06:14.375
Well, as long as you're happy

06:14.409 --> 06:15.809
and I have a white noise machine,

06:15.844 --> 06:17.244
I guess I'm happy, too.

06:17.279 --> 06:19.079
How are you?
How was your first week?

06:19.114 --> 06:21.248
It was good, you know, a little lonely,

06:21.283 --> 06:22.383
but I was thinking to meet people,

06:22.417 --> 06:23.917
I would join the show choir

06:23.952 --> 06:26.520
called the Adam's Apples.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.989
Listen to me, there is a very rigid

06:29.024 --> 06:30.724
performing arts hierarchy at NYADA,

06:30.759 --> 06:33.761
and show choir is, like,
it's the lowest of the low.

06:33.795 --> 06:35.062
It's beneath stage
managers and carpenters.

06:35.096 --> 06:37.698
That is social and career suicide.

06:37.732 --> 06:40.567
But at McKinley...
We're not at McKinley anymore.

06:40.602 --> 06:42.603
And we're done being underdogs;
If you want to join a club,

06:42.637 --> 06:44.505
just do anything but the Adam's Apples.

06:44.539 --> 06:46.840
That's what all the
future chorus kids do.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.575
If you do show choir in college,
all right,

06:48.610 --> 06:50.544
you might as well be doomed
to a life of playing

06:50.578 --> 06:51.912
a dancing teapot at Disneyland.

06:54.716 --> 06:58.085
All right, so
Tina is ready to present her solo

06:58.119 --> 07:00.688
and make her choice.

07:00.722 --> 07:02.222
Gentlemen, prepare yourselves

07:02.257 --> 07:03.390
for Tina Cohen-Chang.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.261
Whoo! Whoo!

07:07.295 --> 07:08.362
Thank you, Finn.

07:08.396 --> 07:09.697
For my song, I'll be performing.

07:09.731 --> 07:11.098
"I Don't Know How to Love Him"

07:11.132 --> 07:12.733
from <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

07:12.767 --> 07:15.269
It's about the pain
of unrequited love and...

07:15.303 --> 07:16.537
Yeah, okay, just wrap it up.

07:16.571 --> 07:18.105
Beiste needs the locker room
at 4:30.

07:18.139 --> 07:19.773
Sorry. Hit it.

07:19.808 --> 07:21.775
Who do you think she's asking?

07:21.810 --> 07:23.410
The only obvious choice in the room.

07:23.445 --> 07:25.145
A charming debonair
figure from her past.

07:25.180 --> 07:27.247
A forbidden love she let
slip through her fingers.

07:27.282 --> 07:29.583
Unique?

07:29.617 --> 07:31.251
Really?

07:31.286 --> 07:37.758
♪ I don't know how to love him ♪

07:37.792 --> 07:40.327
♪ What to do ♪

07:40.362 --> 07:43.931
♪ How to move him ♪

07:43.965 --> 07:46.467
♪ I've been changed ♪

07:46.501 --> 07:49.269
♪ Yes, really changed ♪

07:49.304 --> 07:53.273
♪ In these past few days ♪

07:53.308 --> 07:55.843
♪ When I've seen myself ♪

07:55.877 --> 08:02.516

09:44.219 --> 09:46.687
So... Blaine,

09:46.721 --> 09:49.423
will you go to the dance with me?

09:54.963 --> 09:56.530
Oh, uh...

09:57.899 --> 09:59.466
Wow, um,

09:59.501 --> 10:01.068
Tina...

10:01.102 --> 10:03.770
I don't know what to say.

10:03.805 --> 10:06.273
Um...

10:06.307 --> 10:08.408
no.

10:08.443 --> 10:11.311
Thank you,

10:11.346 --> 10:13.313

10:39.841 --> 10:41.208
of the Adam's Apples, the group you are

10:41.242 --> 10:42.309
very seriously considering joining.

10:42.335 --> 10:44.211
I'm Kurt.
Kurt Hummel.

10:44.237 --> 10:45.371
Your Winter Showcase performance

10:45.405 --> 10:47.306
was breathtaking.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.474
But now you're here,

10:48.508 --> 10:49.608
and you're wondering where you fit in

10:49.642 --> 10:51.143
and how can college be
so much like high school,

10:51.177 --> 10:52.311
and you want to join my group,

10:52.345 --> 10:53.746
but you're aware it's a step backwards,

10:53.780 --> 10:56.648
and no, I'm not a mind-reader,
I'm just astute, like you.

10:56.683 --> 10:59.051
We need you; we want you.

10:59.085 --> 11:01.320
Well, I'm very impressed
you said all that in one breath,

11:01.354 --> 11:02.788
but I don't think I'll be joining.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.758
Man, a hard sell.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.127
I respect that,
but I'm not willing to go down

11:08.161 --> 11:09.828

Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

13:40.313 --> 13:41.580
Yeah.

13:41.614 --> 13:42.915
Uh, my name is Brittany.

13:42.949 --> 13:44.583
I know. Okay. I
just wasn't sure.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.151
We've never actually had
a conversation before,

13:46.186 --> 13:47.786
and this is exciting.

13:47.820 --> 13:50.055
I noticed

13:50.089 --> 13:52.591
that whenever you look at Jake,
you get a really sad look

13:52.625 --> 13:55.928
on your face, and if it's quiet
enough, I can actually hear

13:55.962 --> 13:58.263
that you're whimpering
like a suckling puppy.

13:58.298 --> 14:00.265
I think you want to ask him to
the dance and you're afraid to.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.634
We went out on a couple dates,
and it was really, really nice.

14:02.669 --> 14:04.436
This is my locker.
Oh.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.104
But then, after I
fainted at Sectionals,

14:06.139 --> 14:08.840
he started acting really strange.

14:08.875 --> 14:09.975
He stopped calling me

14:10.009 --> 14:12.744
and he's acting all mysterious.

14:12.779 --> 14:13.812
So can I make a suggestion then?

14:13.846 --> 14:14.980
You need to find your power

14:15.014 --> 14:16.315
and I'm gonna help you do that.

14:16.349 --> 14:17.649
How?

14:17.684 --> 14:19.585
Where are you going?

14:19.619 --> 14:21.153
We're gonna sing a song together,

14:21.187 --> 14:22.454
and the music usually starts

14:22.488 --> 14:24.122
when I say something like,

14:24.157 --> 14:26.825
"It's Brittany, bitch,"

...Jake, would you like to go

16:33.953 --> 16:37.089
to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?

16:37.123 --> 16:37.956
Yes.

16:37.990 --> 16:39.157
Yes, I would.

16:42.028 --> 16:43.762
Okay, uh, anyone else?

16:43.796 --> 16:45.630
Sam,

16:45.665 --> 16:48.500
Mm-hmm? Will you go to
Sadie Hawkins with me?

16:48.534 --> 16:50.102
Honor it would be.

16:50.136 --> 16:51.770
Thank you.

17:04.317 --> 17:06.117
Okay, I'm gonna get right to it.

17:06.152 --> 17:09.488
Dump the bulimic loser and go to
the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me.

17:09.521 --> 17:10.655
What are you talking about?

17:10.690 --> 17:12.357
I thought you and Marley
were friends now.

17:12.392 --> 17:15.827
Duh, we are. I'm still gonna
gaslight her every chance I get.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.496
Look, I realize Marley's super sweet,

17:17.530 --> 17:19.030
and I'm sure you have
great conversations

17:19.065 --> 17:20.699
when you share milkshakes
down at the drive-in

17:20.733 --> 17:21.700
about how you both

17:21.733 --> 17:23.034
love President Eisenhower.

17:23.069 --> 17:25.637
But good luck getting past
first base with that girl.

17:25.671 --> 17:29.608
I, on the other hand,
could offer you a little...

17:29.642 --> 17:32.611
bit... more.

17:32.645 --> 17:36.114
Oh, really? I thought you were
the good Christian <i>virgin</i> type.

17:36.149 --> 17:37.182
I was.

17:37.216 --> 17:39.151
But I've had a change of heart.

17:39.185 --> 17:42.454
Decided to play by my own rules.

17:42.488 --> 17:44.656
You have needs.

17:44.690 --> 17:48.393
Are you really sure
Marley's <i>up</i> for the job?

17:59.439 --> 18:02.340
I owe you an apology.

18:02.375 --> 18:07.345
I... also think you sort of
owe me an apology because...

18:07.380 --> 18:09.681
that was maybe
the most humiliating moment

18:09.715 --> 18:13.285
I've experienced in Glee Club,
and that's saying something.

18:14.387 --> 18:15.654
But still...

18:15.688 --> 18:17.255
I'm sorry.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.591
I forgot that story you told
about your old school.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.760
How the whole reason you
transferred to Dalton

18:21.794 --> 18:24.095
was because you got bullied
at a Sadie Hawkins Dance.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.198
No wonder you don't want to go.

18:27.266 --> 18:29.234
I apologize.
Thank you, Tina,

18:29.268 --> 18:33.438
but that's not why I can't
go to the dance with you.

18:33.473 --> 18:35.440
Then what is the reason?

18:35.475 --> 18:37.409
I-I can't tell you that.

18:37.443 --> 18:38.543
It-s-it's really
embarrassing.

18:38.578 --> 18:40.445
I swear to God I-I
won't tell anyone.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.347
I have a crush on somebody,

18:42.381 --> 18:44.349
and I don't want to go
to a dance where everyone's

18:44.383 --> 18:45.450
gonna be romantic there but me.

18:45.485 --> 18:46.284
Who?

18:48.321 --> 18:49.454
Who is it?
It's-it's a guy

18:49.489 --> 18:50.889
and he's straight and he doesn't know

18:50.923 --> 18:52.123
that I like him.

18:52.158 --> 18:53.458
I swear to God I won't tell anyone.

18:53.493 --> 18:56.027
I'm not some predatory gay,
so... nothing's

18:56.062 --> 18:57.796
gonna happen.
Who is it?

18:57.830 --> 18:59.197
Tell me, Blaine. Y-You can

18:59.232 --> 19:01.132
trust me.

19:03.135 --> 19:04.836
It's Sam.

19:06.739 --> 19:07.806
Dude.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.474
Look at this.

19:09.509 --> 19:11.409
This is Hunter Clarington
two years ago.

19:11.444 --> 19:13.411
Look how skinny his head is.
Okay, this is him now.

19:13.446 --> 19:14.880
Look how much thicker his head is!

19:14.914 --> 19:16.448
So maybe he started working out.

19:16.482 --> 19:17.883
What, doing
skull-widening exercises?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.784
Dude, human growth hormone! HGH!

19:19.819 --> 19:20.986
Same thing happened to Mark McGwire

19:21.020 --> 19:22.053
And Kirstie Alley

19:22.088 --> 19:24.456
and Drew Carey and Star Jones

19:24.490 --> 19:26.458
and Aretha Franklin,
Cedric the Entertainer...

19:26.492 --> 19:27.859
It's so stupid.
No.

19:28.928 --> 19:31.596
It's not stupid.

19:31.631 --> 19:33.265
I know what it's like
to have a crush on someone

19:33.299 --> 19:35.300
who's never gonna love you back.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.071
I know it's all just a fantasy.

19:40.106 --> 19:41.907
I-I mean...
I'm proud of our relationship.

19:41.941 --> 19:44.843
I'm proud the gay guy can be
friends with the straight guy.

19:44.877 --> 19:47.412
I'm proud of showing
the school that. I just...

19:47.446 --> 19:50.482
I don't want to jeopardize our
friendship, you know? Blaine...

19:50.516 --> 19:51.983
you miss Kurt.

19:52.018 --> 19:54.252
You need someplace to
put your love, right?

19:54.287 --> 19:55.520
I guess.

19:56.522 --> 19:58.990
And then there are those lips...

19:59.025 --> 20:00.792
Those lips. Yes, those lips.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.193
And when he does all those impressions?

20:02.228 --> 20:04.629
It's pure crushable crack.

20:04.664 --> 20:07.165
Hello, soul sister.
Isn't that Mr. Mister on the radio?

20:07.199 --> 20:09.100
Stereo? The way you look
ain't fair, you know.

20:13.139 --> 20:16.207
Okay... here's what we're gonna
do about your very human

20:16.242 --> 20:17.776
and moving dilemma.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.978
We are going to the Sadie
Hawkins Dance together.

20:21.547 --> 20:23.048
We'll go as best friends,

20:23.082 --> 20:25.183
and we're gonna have
the most fun night ever.

20:25.217 --> 20:26.184
Okay?

20:26.218 --> 20:28.219
Come on.

20:30.656 --> 20:31.823
Okay.

20:36.573 --> 20:37.973
I mean, I don't know what to do.

20:38.008 --> 20:39.708
Marley is such a great girl

20:39.743 --> 20:41.844
and I really do want to be a
good guy, but it's, like...

20:41.878 --> 20:43.412
Okay. Let me stop you
right there.

20:43.446 --> 20:44.747
Young guys like you

20:44.781 --> 20:46.749
think you have to hit
a home run every time.

20:46.783 --> 20:48.417
But as long as you're getting on base,

20:48.451 --> 20:50.252
you're always in position to score.

20:50.287 --> 20:52.521
No, you don't understand.
I'm not even getting on base.

20:52.556 --> 20:53.722
And all of a sudden.

20:53.757 --> 20:55.057
Kitty's inviting me
to the Home Run Derby.

20:55.091 --> 20:56.892
Look at me.
I'm your hitting coach,

20:56.927 --> 20:58.227
and I'm waving you off.

20:58.261 --> 21:00.229
Seriously?

21:00.263 --> 21:01.931
I mean, it's, like, a sure thing.

21:01.965 --> 21:03.899
Yeah, it's sure to be
some of the best and...

21:03.934 --> 21:06.001
weirdest toe-curling
you'll ever have, but...

21:06.036 --> 21:07.837
it's also sure to ruin your life.

21:07.871 --> 21:10.506
I had every flavor
of Cheerio you can imagine.

21:10.540 --> 21:11.874
Original, Honey Nut.

21:11.908 --> 21:13.008
Did it really mean anything?

21:13.043 --> 21:14.343
No.

21:14.377 --> 21:18.013
I mean, you really like
this Marley chick, right?

21:18.048 --> 21:20.015
You got to resist that
Jesus-loving little devil.

21:20.050 --> 21:22.918
Okay, but Kitty is all up on me.

21:22.953 --> 21:24.520
She's not going away.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.589
Don't you worry, little brother
from a different-colored mother.

21:26.623 --> 21:28.591
I'll make her go away.

21:32.062 --> 21:33.729
Okay, so Brody said he's
gonna meet me at the library

21:33.763 --> 21:35.397
to go downtown.
Do you want to come?

21:35.432 --> 21:37.099
No, no, thanks; I don't want
to be a haggy third wheel

21:37.133 --> 21:38.534
on your guys's date.
Come on, you won't be.

21:38.568 --> 21:40.102
All right, you know
what I can't wait for?

21:40.136 --> 21:42.438
I can't wait for you to find the
new man of your dreams. Mm.

21:42.472 --> 21:44.440
And then me, you, him,
and Brody can all go

21:44.474 --> 21:46.275
on double-dates together,
and it'll be so much fun.

21:46.309 --> 21:48.110
I really feel
like it's gonna happen soon.

21:48.144 --> 21:50.479
Actually, there is someone
that I have my eye on.

21:50.513 --> 21:52.147
Oh, my God. Who?
Is it Raul Esparza?

21:52.182 --> 21:53.449
No, I wish. 'Cause
that would be great.

21:53.483 --> 21:55.284
No, he goes to school with us,

21:55.318 --> 21:57.620
but, I don't know, lately things
have been happening, and...

21:57.654 --> 21:59.989
I'm just gonna try
and figure out if he likes me.

22:00.023 --> 22:02.658
<i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof?</i>

22:02.692 --> 22:05.728
Hi, uh... it's for the Tennessee
Williams Play-Reading Club.

22:05.762 --> 22:07.563
You'd make a fantastic Brick.

22:07.597 --> 22:09.598
Kind of look like a young Paul Newman.

22:20.377 --> 22:23.679
Hey, Kurt. Nice plié. Oh...

22:23.713 --> 22:26.282
Hi, again. Uh, no.

22:26.316 --> 22:28.951
Uh, my ex-boyfriend was
more of the dancer in...

22:28.985 --> 22:30.686
in our relationship.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.588
Let's try this again.

22:32.622 --> 22:34.423
Hey, Kurt.

22:34.457 --> 22:36.125
Nice plié.

22:38.061 --> 22:40.029
Thank you.

22:40.063 --> 22:42.264
You're welcome.

22:42.299 --> 22:44.433
Oh, my God, he is
totally crushing on you!

22:44.467 --> 22:45.601
What is his name?

22:45.635 --> 22:47.436
I-I don't want
to jinx it, okay?

22:47.470 --> 22:50.673
I mean, he's 22,
sophisticated, handsome.

22:50.707 --> 22:52.308
Great.

22:52.342 --> 22:54.476
Just not what he wants...
to be with me.

22:54.511 --> 22:56.378
Oh, God, Kurt, you are a catch, okay?

22:56.413 --> 22:59.381
And now that, you know, things
with you and Blaine are good,

22:59.416 --> 23:01.050
and you're finally over the breakup,

23:01.084 --> 23:02.718
I think it's really time for you

23:02.752 --> 23:04.453
to put yourself out there, you know?

23:04.487 --> 23:06.355
Hey, look, if this guy doesn't want

23:06.389 --> 23:07.890
to ask you out, then you

23:07.924 --> 23:09.558
ask him out, okay?

23:09.592 --> 23:11.560
I promise you, it'll be worth the risk.

23:11.594 --> 23:13.729
There's nothing like being
in love in New York.

23:13.763 --> 23:15.397
Love? Already?

23:15.432 --> 23:16.966
What can I say?
Things move fast here.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.567
It's not like high school.

23:18.601 --> 23:21.403
Says the girl who almost
got married before graduation.

23:21.438 --> 23:23.739
Seize the moment! Do it!

23:23.773 --> 23:25.374
It'll be worth it.

23:33.350 --> 23:34.550
I'm going to keep this simple,

23:34.584 --> 23:36.185
for my sake as much as yours.

23:36.219 --> 23:37.820
Stay away from my little bro.

23:37.854 --> 23:39.722
He's not interested in
your skanky Meow Mix.

23:39.756 --> 23:41.924
Speaking of things that are
past their freshness date,

23:41.958 --> 23:44.360
didn't you graduate...
barely?

23:44.394 --> 23:45.894
I recently relocated back to Lima.

23:45.929 --> 23:47.529
I find it to be a less
distracting environment

23:47.564 --> 23:49.231
to focus on my <i>screenwriting.</i>

23:49.265 --> 23:51.233
Don't you have to be able
to spell to be a writer?

23:51.267 --> 23:52.701
I know how to spell.

23:52.736 --> 23:55.037
Leave my brother A-L-O-N.

23:55.071 --> 23:56.905
I understand the Puckerman
musk is impossible

23:56.940 --> 23:58.540
for chicks to resist.
We're like

23:58.575 --> 24:00.376
chocolate chip cookies
right out of the oven.

24:00.410 --> 24:02.511
Sure you know we're not
good for you, but one whiff

24:02.545 --> 24:05.014
of our fresh-baked goodness,
and the next thing you know,

24:05.048 --> 24:07.116
you're lying in bed,
covered in crumbs, crying.

24:10.286 --> 24:11.387
Jake is fighting his instincts.

24:11.421 --> 24:12.521
He's trying to be a good guy.

24:12.555 --> 24:14.256
If you really like him,

24:14.290 --> 24:16.425
you'll back off and give him
a chance to do the right thing.

24:16.459 --> 24:18.927
I don't like Jake.

24:18.962 --> 24:22.197
I'm a mean, hot, bitch that
likes to get what she wants.

24:22.232 --> 24:24.566
Well, it's not gonna happen.

24:24.601 --> 24:26.068
I'm not going to let it happen,

24:26.102 --> 24:28.537
so all you're going to do is get
rejected and embarrass yourself.

24:28.571 --> 24:29.972
Fair point.

24:30.006 --> 24:33.075
But I certainly can't
go to the dance alone.

24:33.109 --> 24:35.377
Out.

24:35.412 --> 24:38.881
What are you doing Saturday night?

24:38.915 --> 24:40.649
You want to go with me?

24:40.683 --> 24:42.785
It's depressing that
you hang around school,

24:42.819 --> 24:44.820
but you're just hot
enough to pull it off.

24:44.854 --> 24:46.555
I assume vintage Puckerman
is just as tasty.

24:46.589 --> 24:48.457
It's better, but you can't handle me.

24:48.491 --> 24:50.793
You're used to dealing with amateurs.

24:50.827 --> 24:52.294
I'm professional.

24:52.328 --> 24:53.295
What's the difference?

24:53.329 --> 24:55.130
Amateurs have threesomes.

24:55.165 --> 24:56.465
Professionals have foursomes.

24:56.499 --> 24:58.567
I've seen things, done things

24:58.601 --> 25:00.335
that would keep you up at night.

25:00.370 --> 25:03.472
You want to keep me away
from your brother?

25:03.506 --> 25:06.175
Give me a big old yarn ball
of muscles to distract me.

25:06.209 --> 25:08.143
Aren't you underage?
I have a fake I.D.

25:08.178 --> 25:09.812
Good enough for me.

25:09.846 --> 25:11.513
It's Sadie Hawkins, so, I assume

25:11.548 --> 25:13.315
that means you're paying
for everything.

25:13.349 --> 25:17.519
And if you want to get all up
in this, I expect to be fed.

25:17.554 --> 25:19.688
I'll pick you up at 7:00. We can
swing by the drive-through.

25:19.722 --> 25:22.825
And my dates are always
underwear-optional.

25:28.331 --> 25:32.534
Tina, these decorations are incredible.

25:32.569 --> 25:34.870
Well, Sadie Hawkins Dances are
sometimes called "Snowballs,"

25:34.904 --> 25:37.606
so that's where I got the
idea for a snowflake theme.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.375
I'm really glad
that you invited me to this.

25:40.410 --> 25:42.311
No Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder

25:42.345 --> 25:43.545
from what happened before?

25:43.580 --> 25:45.114
I thought there might be, but no.

25:45.148 --> 25:46.682
I'm thrilled.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.450
What's up, McKinley?

25:49.886 --> 25:51.653
We've got quite the set.

25:51.688 --> 25:52.955
We'd like to dedicate

25:52.989 --> 25:55.190
this song to all the strong, proud

25:55.225 --> 25:57.659
and empowered ladies
who stuck their necks out

25:57.694 --> 25:59.027
to make this happen.

25:59.062 --> 26:00.963
This week, you showed us
what it feels like

26:00.997 --> 26:03.031
to wait anxiously
by the phone that never rings.

26:03.066 --> 26:05.701
The horror when all your friends
get asked to the dance,

26:05.735 --> 26:07.503
and you don't,
and you have to sit there...

26:07.537 --> 26:09.238
All right, cool.
Thank you, Artie.

26:09.272 --> 26:11.707

35:30.161 --> 35:31.428

35:41.039 --> 35:41.905
We looked it up online.

35:41.939 --> 35:42.973
Plus, uh...

35:43.007 --> 35:43.974
Look at this cell phone video

35:44.008 --> 35:45.308
that Artie and Joe Hart took

35:45.343 --> 35:46.176
down at the Lima Bean the other day.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.177

35:47.211 --> 35:48.578

35:48.613 --> 35:51.348
You're a barista!
You don't think!

35:51.382 --> 35:53.183
You need to remember like six things
Here comes the biscotti throw.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.786
And one of them is that the
sugar comes in the brown packet

35:55.820 --> 35:57.954
and the Splenda is in the yellow!

35:57.989 --> 36:00.524
I freaking hate Splenda!

36:00.558 --> 36:03.193
It tastes like pencils!

36:03.227 --> 36:05.195

36:14.439 --> 36:16.039
"Any team using
performance-enhancing drugs,"

36:16.074 --> 36:18.041

anabolic steroid,

36:18.076 --> 36:20.277
human growth hormone or Four Loko

36:20.311 --> 36:22.612
will be automatically
disqualified from competition.

36:22.647 --> 36:23.680
The rule is retroactive,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.315
so if we can prove that they used

36:25.349 --> 36:27.217
at Sectionals, they'll have to forfeit

36:27.251 --> 36:28.218
and we'll win.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.720
Glee Club is back.
Blam!

36:29.754 --> 36:32.522
Guys, what you are asking me
to do here is beyond serious.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.124
The Warblers are, like,

36:34.158 --> 36:35.826
one of the most respected
glee clubs in the country.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.028
To accuse them of this
when-when all we have for proof

36:38.062 --> 36:41.998
is photos of some dudes' heads
and a-a cell phone video?

36:42.033 --> 36:43.500
Look, I want Glee Club back

36:43.534 --> 36:44.968
just as much as you guys, but...

36:45.002 --> 36:46.903
this isn't enough.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.072
We need more real proof.

36:49.107 --> 36:51.007
We have some.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.478
Me.

36:54.512 --> 36:56.012
I knew when Trent didn't
perform with the Warblers

36:56.047 --> 36:57.013
at Sectionals that something was up.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.548
Yeah, he is

36:58.583 --> 37:01.351
kind of like the sunshine
of the group, isn't he?

37:01.385 --> 37:03.754
Blaine and I joined
the Warblers together.

37:03.788 --> 37:05.322
It was a band of brothers,

37:05.356 --> 37:07.657
a group joined by harmony and honor.

37:07.692 --> 37:11.661
And then Blaine left and
Sebastian came, then Hunter...

37:11.696 --> 37:13.330
They just chipped away at everything

37:13.364 --> 37:15.398
that was good and special about us.

37:15.433 --> 37:16.566
Next.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.436
<i>Winning was everything.</i>

37:19.470 --> 37:21.204
<i>I mean, you took the shots</i>
<i>or you didn't perform.</i>

37:21.239 --> 37:23.406
Next. <i>Singing with the
Warblers is my life,</i>

37:23.441 --> 37:25.509
<i>but I couldn't do it.</i>

37:25.543 --> 37:28.178
<i>My hormones can't handle</i>
<i>heroic doses of testosterone.</i>

37:28.212 --> 37:29.179
You. Sensitive.

37:29.213 --> 37:31.248
Get over here.
What are you, afraid?

37:31.282 --> 37:32.315
I'm not doing this.

37:32.841 --> 37:35.519
I don't even shave yet.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.187
The Warblers mean everything to me,

37:37.221 --> 37:39.723
and it's killing me
to betray them like this.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.424
You're not betraying them.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.460
Hunter betrayed the Warblers,
you're saving them.

37:43.494 --> 37:44.795
Yeah, that's what they said
about Brutus.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.062
And Cassius.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.597
Look, if I go public with this,

37:47.632 --> 37:49.633
then the Warblers' reputation...
it's ruined forever.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.769
Years of honorable melodies
and harmonies, all forgotten.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.070
Look, the Warblers'
reputation was ruined

37:54.105 --> 37:56.973
the second
they decided to cheat to win.

37:57.008 --> 37:57.908
Fact.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.075
So, what do you say?

37:59.705 --> 38:01.278
Will you do this?

38:01.312 --> 38:02.746
Will you testify against the Warblers?

38:26.648 --> 38:28.716
Hey, sorry I'm late.

38:30.652 --> 38:31.952
What are you doing?
It's 9:45.

38:31.987 --> 38:33.287
I invited you over at 9:00.

38:33.321 --> 38:34.822
You're 45 minutes late.

38:34.856 --> 38:35.789
Your turkey burger is cold.

38:35.824 --> 38:36.857
You know, six months ago,

38:36.892 --> 38:37.858
I probably would've just smiled

38:37.893 --> 38:39.393
and reheated this all up for you,

38:39.427 --> 38:41.228
and I would have been grateful
that you showed up at all.

38:41.263 --> 38:42.796
Wait, you're actually pissed?

38:42.831 --> 38:44.498
Yeah, I am.
You know, it's amazing

38:44.532 --> 38:46.567
how I strive for such greatness
for myself and my career,

38:46.601 --> 38:48.135
but I'm fine with taking

38:48.169 --> 38:49.536
whatever scraps I can get
in my personal life.

38:49.571 --> 38:51.338
Well, I'm sorry.
The train was late.

38:51.373 --> 38:53.474
You should've left earlier.
Okay?

38:53.508 --> 38:55.409
Let me ask you,
I-if I would've told you

38:55.443 --> 38:56.510
that there was, like,

38:56.544 --> 38:57.711
ten million dollars here

38:57.746 --> 38:59.179
at this apartment waiting for you,

38:59.214 --> 39:00.848
then would you have come on time?

39:00.882 --> 39:02.416
Because I think I'm worth
more than ten million dollars.

39:02.450 --> 39:04.418
Yes.

39:04.452 --> 39:05.986
You're priceless.

39:06.021 --> 39:08.088
And you're right.

39:08.123 --> 39:09.523
And if it means anything to you,

39:09.557 --> 39:12.860
it was freezing on the train platform.

39:12.894 --> 39:14.328
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

39:14.362 --> 39:15.763
No.

39:15.797 --> 39:18.432
Because I didn't care.

39:18.466 --> 39:21.135
Because that train
was taking me here, to you.

39:24.306 --> 39:26.740
And all I was thinking was that

39:26.775 --> 39:29.176
I would wait all night,

39:29.210 --> 39:32.246
I-I would wait my whole life
for that train,

39:32.280 --> 39:36.116
if it meant that I got to spend
my last day with you.

39:38.286 --> 39:40.421
I guess I could
put it in the microwave.

39:43.058 --> 39:44.258
Not yet.

39:44.292 --> 39:45.292
We-We have
plenty of time to eat.

39:45.327 --> 39:47.561
I want to dance.

39:49.230 --> 39:50.931
Come on.
But there's no music.

39:50.966 --> 39:53.534

I realized how awesome I was.

Hey. I thought you split.

40:56.131 --> 40:58.165
No. No, not at all.

40:58.199 --> 40:59.867
We were just dealing
with some Glee stuff.

40:59.901 --> 41:01.368
Anything good?
I'm not sure yet,

41:01.403 --> 41:03.704
but if it works out, we may
have just saved the Glee Club.

41:03.738 --> 41:06.040
Is there anything you can't do?

41:06.074 --> 41:08.342
I know I can't possibly

42:25.587 --> 42:27.754
Why don't you just move in?

42:32.393 --> 42:34.294
All right, let the record

42:34.329 --> 42:35.429
state that the ladies of McKinley

42:35.463 --> 42:36.930
are grateful
to Tina Cohen-Chang.

42:36.965 --> 42:39.299
That Sadie Hawkins Dance
gave me back my swag.

42:39.334 --> 42:41.735
I not only snagged the cutest
Christian hippie in all of Ohio,

42:41.769 --> 42:42.936
I was also empowered

42:42.971 --> 42:44.872
to apply for a wrestling
scholarship at...

42:44.906 --> 42:45.873
Harvard.

42:47.142 --> 42:48.742
I think Brett really likes me.

42:48.776 --> 42:50.277
He even baked me brownies.

42:50.311 --> 42:51.945
Isn't that sweet?

42:51.980 --> 42:53.547
I can't stop eating them.

42:53.581 --> 42:56.250
And I got to third base, bitches!

42:58.453 --> 42:59.820
The dance couldn't have
gone more perfectly

42:59.854 --> 43:02.055
if I do say so myself.

43:02.090 --> 43:03.290
And just between us girls,

43:03.324 --> 43:04.758
I think I found the love of my life.

43:04.792 --> 43:07.394
What? You're not talking
about Gay Blaine?

43:07.428 --> 43:09.296
The "Too Young to Be Bitter
Club" is hereby disbanded.

43:11.699 --> 43:12.933
Bring it in, Tina! Bring it in!

43:12.967 --> 43:15.090
Get over here, Tina.
