are Codex reforming?

20:59.693 --> 21:01.434
We destroyed all of
Leland's hard drives,

21:01.477 --> 21:03.610
denied him access
to his hidden funds,

21:03.653 --> 21:05.133
his infrastructure.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.396
I myself put a drill
through all the drives.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.355
We left him a fugitive
with nothing but the clothes

21:09.398 --> 21:11.618
on his back.And what's strange is
this doesn't even fit

21:11.661 --> 21:13.097
Codex's previous patterns.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.404
I mean,
their whole agenda

21:15.448 --> 21:17.450
is to save the world
from climate catastrophe.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.626
How does learning about
secret U.S. bases

21:19.669 --> 21:21.149
help them achieve that goal?

21:21.192 --> 21:23.325
Unless the goal's changed.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.935
Well,

21:24.979 --> 21:27.416
Leland's too bloody-minded
for that.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.896

We're missing
something.

We move out when
the transmission is complete.

Oh, look over there.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.568
It's decryption equipment.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.787
That's where they're
transmitting the signal from.

21:50.831 --> 21:54.225
Okay, he's copying the
data to the mainframe.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.053
It'll take some time
for the decryption.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.099
Mac has to stop
that transmission

21:58.142 --> 21:59.883

that drive.

there's another foothold.

If I can reach it,

23:21.704 --> 23:24.315
I might be able to push off
to grab the handhold.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.317
And that would mean...

unhooking my safety line

23:28.624 --> 23:30.844
and free climbing my way up.

Okay, gonna stop you there.

Great job, Mac.

32:50.577 --> 32:51.665
Now get out of there.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.667
Yeah, I-I'm not gonna do that.

32:53.710 --> 32:54.973
Come again?

32:55.016 --> 32:57.018
Look, we know that Codex
is reforming.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.715
And this cell was
transmitting valuable intel,

32:58.759 --> 33:00.674
so it stands to reason

33:00.717 --> 33:02.632
that they were sending it
to a central command.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.504
Leland.MacGYVER: Exactly.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.114
If we trace this signal,

33:06.158 --> 33:08.290
it's our chance to find him
and stop Codex once and for all.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.031
BOZER:
Access the tower's digital logs

33:10.075 --> 33:11.511
and find out where it was
sending the intel.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.034
MATTY:
Okay, I'll mobilize
a tac team.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.035
Get their location.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.342

Okay.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.213
Tell me you took care
of MacGyver.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.823
He's jammed our upload.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.304
They've sealed the borders.
There's no way out.

33:22.348 --> 33:23.914
Sure there is.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.004
We have a bargaining chip.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.528
Princess is
coming on the trip.

33:28.571 --> 33:32.445
If we're not given
safe passage, she dies.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.973
Uploading the digital logs now.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.496
Got 'em. I'll track
the I.P. address

meet you there.

33:46.154 --> 33:49.244
Right, tell them to hurry,
because I drive fast. Bozer?

33:49.288 --> 33:50.680
I want to be there for this.

33:51.681 --> 33:52.987
What about Desi and Riley?

MATTY:
You've got bigger fish to fry.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.382
I mean, you may have
stopped the transmission,

33:56.425 --> 33:58.862
but how are you gonna
get out of there?

34:06.044 --> 34:07.741
I'll improvise.

to get out of there.

[chuckles]:
Yeah, I am working on it.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.574
MacGYVER:
In mining, in order to process
minerals on a large scale,

34:58.618 --> 35:02.187
you need water, lots of water.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.145
All I have to do
is find the pipes.

35:04.189 --> 35:07.279
When it's scarce, like in the mountains of Uzbekistan,

35:07.322 --> 35:09.455
it must be siphoned
from a local source.

35:09.498 --> 35:12.675
In this case, the Aral Sea.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.245
Where are you going with this?

35:18.725 --> 35:20.596
Underground.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.559
All I have to do

35:26.602 --> 35:28.691
is go through those pipes,
and I should be able to come out

35:28.735 --> 35:31.216
on the other side
of those Codex agents.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.392
Assuming those pipes are clear.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.176
They haven't been accessed
in 30 years.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.961

We don't know what's down there.
