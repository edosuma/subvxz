WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.301
MAN:
 Previously on East Los High...

00:01.368 --> 00:02.769
Will you go
to Homecoming?

00:03.036 --> 00:05.172
You just blew it.
Now for sure I'm taking Gina.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.040
Go to homecoming with me?
Hell, yeah.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.709
You're friends
with Diego?

00:08.775 --> 00:10.777
Yeah, you know him?
I've seen him around.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.080
Tiffany?
We could double date now.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.650
I got invited
to this year's

00:16.717 --> 00:18.619
Young Voice Poetry Slam.
Can I come?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.687
The poetry slam is
the same night as the dance.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.256
I don't care
about Homecoming.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.691
Want to go to Homecoming?
Sorry, got a date.

00:24.758 --> 00:28.095
You got nominated for queen!
I did?

00:28.162 --> 00:30.531
Joc, you don't mind
if Camilla goes with me?

00:30.597 --> 00:33.033
It's up to her. I'm okay
with whatever she decides.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.469
Then it's settled.
Guess you and me got a date.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.640
Camilla, hurry up! I want
to see how you look already.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.242
CAMILLA:
Chill, Project Runway!

00:42.309 --> 00:45.145
Damn!
From tragic to magic.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.080
That doesn't even look like
mom's dress anymore.

00:47.147 --> 00:50.450
I know, girl. Look, I can
twerk in it and everything.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.052
Thanks to you.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.188
Your new boyfriend's
gonna love it.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.057
Nick and I are just friends.

00:57.124 --> 00:59.726
Right. Nick is totally
not your type.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.563
He's hot, funny
and not married.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.298
Ugh. Shut up.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.767
( humming )

01:07.034 --> 01:10.470
Ha-ha. Look who just
walked off the cover of GQ.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.406
Yeah. You feeling
my swag, huh?

01:12.472 --> 01:15.309
What's up with your tie?
Come here.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.412
Thanks.

01:18.478 --> 01:21.548
Mm. You know I'm not used
to wearing no ties, no suits...

01:21.615 --> 01:23.317
No underwear.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.185
Ugh. TMI!

01:25.252 --> 01:26.787
Look at how beautiful!

01:27.054 --> 01:29.656
La fashionista
y la wannabe Homecoming Queen.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.491
You know, I would have been
Homecoming Queen

01:31.558 --> 01:34.127
if I wasn't eight months
pregnant with this one.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.330
Always my fault.
Well, it's true.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.065
After the dance,
I want my dress back.

01:38.131 --> 01:41.401
So...no man juice on it.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.405
Have fun.
Oh, I will.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.674
Hey, you got any condoms?
Hm?

01:47.741 --> 01:51.078
You're going with Camila.
You don't need any condoms.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.381
Oh, she rolls like that?
Then I'm definitely bagging it.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.383
That's not what I meant,
 pendejo.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.219
You sure you're not coming home
till super late tonight, right?

01:59.286 --> 02:01.788
CAMILA:
 Ay, como chingas.
 For the hundredth time, yeah.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.559
I'm sorry. I just need to make
sure everything's perfect.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.799
Dang! Someone's desperate
to cut up her V card.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.202
I'm not desperate!

02:15.269 --> 02:17.771
PEDRO:
Ceci, are you ready?

02:18.038 --> 02:19.373
Yeah!
PEDRO: Let's go.

02:19.439 --> 02:23.076
Okay.
We're going to be late.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.113
As soon as the babysitter
gets here, we are out.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.081
What the hell are you wearing?
CECI: You like it?

02:28.148 --> 02:31.251
Ceci, you can't wear that
to my boss's birthday party.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.452
What are you
talking about?

02:32.519 --> 02:34.154
Tonight's the dance.
What dance?

02:34.221 --> 02:36.256
Pedro, I told you,
like, a million times.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.392
Tonight's Homecoming.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.193
All right, well,
you can't go.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.563
We're going to my boss's
birthday party. Now go change.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.333
I can't, baby, it's my job.
What about my job?

02:46.400 --> 02:49.236
We gotta be there. You know I'm
up for a big promotion, babe.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.637
I told you about this.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.673
Why you tripping?

02:52.739 --> 02:55.242
Are you gonna drive me
to the dance or what?

02:55.309 --> 02:57.444
What goddamn choice do I have?

03:03.483 --> 03:05.485
( sighs ):
So, what time is this
stupid thing over at?

03:05.552 --> 03:06.753
CECI:
Ten.

03:08.155 --> 03:11.291
Is Jacob gonna be there?
( scoffs )

03:11.358 --> 03:13.660
I don't know. Do you want me
to call you when I see him?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.562
( sighs )

03:17.564 --> 03:19.599
PEDRO:
Don't.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.003
Ugh. Okay, whatever.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.674
( tires squeal )

03:29.109 --> 03:30.677
( Lorena
speaking in Spanish )

03:30.744 --> 03:32.612
The Latino Ken and Barbie.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.481
GINA:
Okay, Mom, hurry up.
We really gotta go.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.316
Hold on. I just need
a few more pictures.

03:36.383 --> 03:40.187
Mijo, you make sure you
take care of my baby girl, okay?

03:40.253 --> 03:42.089
Por que esa Amber
esta still missing.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.257
Don't worry, Señora Barrios.
I'll have her back by 11.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.692
Tampoco.
 She's not a nun.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.729
You just make sure
you have her back here by 1:00.

03:48.795 --> 03:52.466
Okay, a few more pictures.
Ay, you look so pretty.

03:52.532 --> 03:53.734
You look just like me.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.235
How do I look?

03:55.302 --> 03:58.405
Wow. You look like a supermodel.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.174
Ay, stop it.
Okay, keep going.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.010
( both laugh )

04:04.077 --> 04:06.713
So, uh, are we gonna
hook up later?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.783
Yeah, after-party
at your place. Shh.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.085
JOCELYN: We're on.
Hey.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.487
You better kick ass
at the poetry slam.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.288
( speaking in Spanish )
Thanks.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.757
And you have fun with Nick.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.225
( doorbell rings )

04:18.291 --> 04:19.493
Hey, that's him.
I gotta go.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.062
Just not too much fun.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.398
Nicky!
Hola, Señora Barrios.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.633
I haven't seen you in years.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.403
Looks like you've grown up.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.304
( softly ):
In all the right places.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.173
NICOLAS:
Thank you, Señora Barrios.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.644
Ay, Por favor. Don't call me
señora, call me Lorena.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.182
Ugh. Kick back, Ma.
Nic's my date.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.017
Hey.
Hey.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.786
What's up, beautiful?

04:46.052 --> 04:47.621
You know, that's my dress
she's wearing.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.624
People say we look
like sisters. Que no?

04:50.690 --> 04:53.026
More like twins.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.062
Ay, Nicky. Flattery
will get you everywhere.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.233
CAMILA: Let's go.
LORENA: Wait. I need a picture.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.302
( sighs )

05:05.172 --> 05:08.108
LORENA: Here.

Nobody spikes the punch
on my watch.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.495
Good job.
I'm gonna go make sure

06:35.562 --> 06:37.531
no one's making babies
under the bleachers.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.566
Oh, Ms. Alvarez.
Not the bleachers.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.668
Girls don't wanna
get their dresses dirty.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.403
Check the equipment room.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.105
Just a guess.
Ha-ha.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.373
Ew.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.480
( sighs )

07:00.186 --> 07:02.289
( dance music playing

07:02.355 --> 07:04.224
( crowd cheering )

07:14.953 --> 07:17.289
This is a drawing from a graphic
novel I've been working on.

07:17.556 --> 07:19.291
Oh, my God.
You're so good.

07:19.558 --> 07:21.526
You think you could
draw me sometime?

07:21.593 --> 07:24.096
Hell, yeah.
I love drawing hot girls.

07:24.162 --> 07:26.064
Ha-ha. Thanks.

07:26.131 --> 07:28.233
How long do you think
it'll take?

07:28.300 --> 07:32.604
It depends. If it's a portrait,
it could take a couple hours.

07:32.671 --> 07:34.806
But if it's
a figure drawing--

07:34.873 --> 07:39.077
Ha-ha. Zac, you're so funny.
Hey, what's up guys?

07:39.144 --> 07:41.079
GINA:
Hey Tiff, you are wearing
that dress!

07:41.146 --> 07:43.181
Thanks. It's my lucky
pageant dress.

07:43.248 --> 07:46.952
Wow.
Yo, you looking at my girl?

07:47.018 --> 07:51.022
No, the dress.
Uh, who's the designer?

07:51.089 --> 07:53.525
"Who's the designer?"
Really, bro?

07:53.592 --> 07:56.194
So I watch the VMA's
for the Red Carpet. Kill me.

07:56.261 --> 07:58.263
I will if you
keep talking like that.

07:58.530 --> 08:01.833
Thank you for noticing, Zac.
I designed it. House of Gina.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.137
Diego's just jealous.
He wants all the attention.

08:05.203 --> 08:06.638
Zac says he wants to draw me.

08:06.705 --> 08:08.140
Naked.

08:08.206 --> 08:11.543
What? All right, I'm down.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.612
Ha-ha. You're so bad.

08:13.678 --> 08:14.846
DIEGO:
You guys want some punch?

08:14.913 --> 08:17.716
Thank you very much.

08:17.782 --> 08:19.985
Damn.
Why'd you do that?

08:20.051 --> 08:21.553
( crowd applauding )

08:21.620 --> 08:24.256
How are you doing,
East Los High?

08:24.523 --> 08:26.992
( crowd cheering )

08:27.058 --> 08:29.895
East High,
it's time to find out

08:29.961 --> 08:32.831
who your new
Homecoming King and Queen are.

08:32.898 --> 08:34.900
( crowd cheering )

08:36.835 --> 08:38.970
Thank you, Ms. A.

08:39.037 --> 08:42.807
So the nominees for
your Homecoming Queen are:

08:42.874 --> 08:45.710
Camila Barrios,

08:45.777 --> 08:46.912
( speaking indistinctly )

08:46.978 --> 08:48.246
Ooh!

08:48.313 --> 08:49.881
Britney Rodriguez,

08:53.285 --> 08:54.853
Ashley Fernandez.

08:58.690 --> 09:00.292
And your new
Homecoming Queen is...

09:00.559 --> 09:02.561
You got this.

09:02.627 --> 09:05.230
Britney Rodriguez!

09:05.297 --> 09:07.299
( crowd cheering )

09:10.969 --> 09:13.271
JACOB:
Let me hold this for one second.

09:13.538 --> 09:15.840
Here you go.
You got robbed.

09:15.907 --> 09:18.276
JACOB: Congratulations.
I didn't want it anyway.

09:18.543 --> 09:21.146
JACOB:
All right, here we go. Whoo!

09:21.213 --> 09:22.881
Sorry your sister lost.

09:22.948 --> 09:24.816
I know. It's too bad. She--
Hey, how do I look?

09:24.883 --> 09:27.152
Hey, good luck, I voted for you.
Of course. Everyone did.

09:27.219 --> 09:31.523
The nominees for
your Homecoming King are:

09:31.590 --> 09:34.793
Diego Campos,

09:34.859 --> 09:36.561
Christopher Vargas,

09:39.531 --> 09:41.566
Manny Martinez,

09:43.068 --> 09:44.669
and Nicolas Reyes.

09:49.007 --> 09:52.244
( sighs )
And the Homecoming King is...

09:54.079 --> 09:55.614
Diego Campos!

09:55.680 --> 09:58.316
( crowd cheering )

10:07.993 --> 10:10.595
What's up, East Los?

10:10.662 --> 10:12.597
Thanks for choosing me
as your new Homecoming King.

10:12.664 --> 10:14.132
As your new Homecoming King,
I promise to --

10:14.199 --> 10:16.801
( dance music playing
over speakers )

10:45.664 --> 10:48.166
These are the last hours
that you're gonna be a virgin.

10:48.233 --> 10:50.568
Let's go take a picture.

10:50.635 --> 10:52.304
Yeah, because I'm gonna look
totally different.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.839
Maybe?
My first time was awful.

10:54.906 --> 10:57.842
And it hurt so much
for months.

10:57.909 --> 10:59.311
And who did you lose it to,
a horse?

10:59.577 --> 11:02.147
Ha-ha.
Gina's gonna do it with Diego.

11:02.213 --> 11:05.317
And Diego's gentle,
and we're in love.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.786
And when it's right,
it's right.

11:07.852 --> 11:09.120
Come on.
Let's go to the photo booth.

11:09.187 --> 11:10.588
All right. Come on.

11:10.655 --> 11:11.923
( groans )

11:14.125 --> 11:17.195
Oh, hey. You should totally put
the condoms under your pillow,

11:17.262 --> 11:18.963
so that it won't
mess up the moment.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.265
( flash pops )

11:20.532 --> 11:22.534
GINA: How do you know all that?
Girl, I read.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.870
Me too. I got scented candles,
red rose petals...

11:25.937 --> 11:28.673
I am surprised
you didn't get a Brazilian.

11:28.740 --> 11:29.874
Who says I didn't?

11:29.941 --> 11:31.743
( Gina and Filiberta giggle )

11:31.810 --> 11:34.679
Don't you have to be on the pill
for a month for it to work?

11:34.746 --> 11:36.214
Yeah. That's why
I got condoms, too.

11:36.281 --> 11:38.216
Some girl at my old school
had sex with her boyfriend

11:38.283 --> 11:41.086
for the first time,
and she immediately got herpes.

11:41.152 --> 11:45.623
Herpes?
Yeah, that's forever.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.793
That's not gonna happen to Gina.
She has condoms.

11:48.860 --> 11:50.929
But it only protects you
if he actually wears one.

11:50.995 --> 11:52.664
Oh, he'll put one on.

11:52.731 --> 11:55.767
Good luck with that.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.268
Hey, Ms. A said
that you needed help,

11:57.535 --> 11:59.904
but looks like you got
everything under control, so--

11:59.971 --> 12:03.174
Get your ass back here.
You got me into this.

12:03.241 --> 12:07.112
Fine, fine.
I'll help you pour.

12:07.178 --> 12:08.646
GIRL:
Thank you.

12:08.713 --> 12:12.283
Hey, everything's
gonna be cool. Chill.

12:12.550 --> 12:13.718
Dang.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.156
Here you go.

12:18.223 --> 12:19.891
You could say "thank you."
BOY: Thank you.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.960
( muffled music playing
from inside )

12:28.299 --> 12:31.302
( dramatic theme playing )

12:39.644 --> 12:41.946
( dance music playing
over speakers )

12:42.013 --> 12:44.315
Looks like we're
a couple of losers.

12:44.582 --> 12:47.685
Compared to who? The queen
of ugly and the king of fools.

12:47.752 --> 12:49.654
Ha-ha.
I'm glad we didn't win.

12:49.721 --> 12:52.056
It would've messed up
our pimpness.

12:52.123 --> 12:53.658
That's true.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.828
What are we spinning next?

12:56.895 --> 12:59.798
( slow dance music
playing over speakers )

12:59.864 --> 13:01.599

13:09.707 --> 13:10.909

Gracias. I am Abalina Anthony.
And I want to thank you

14:24.949 --> 14:27.652
and welcome you
to our youth poetry night.

14:27.719 --> 14:29.988
Now let's get ready
to be inspired.

14:30.054 --> 14:34.792
Please give it up for
the incredible Iris De Anda.

14:34.859 --> 14:38.029
( crowd cheering )

14:38.096 --> 14:40.899
Thank you, Abalina. Always
a blessing to be on the mic.

14:40.965 --> 14:42.734
I'm gonna share
a poem tonight called,

14:42.800 --> 14:44.536
"To Be A Pocha Or Not To Be."

14:44.602 --> 14:48.006
Because I'm neither
From here or there

14:48.072 --> 14:50.542
I speak both languages
With a flare

14:50.608 --> 14:53.645
Born in Los Angeles
With roots that extend

14:53.711 --> 14:57.882
Reaching out to faraway lands
Faraway sands

14:57.949 --> 15:01.219
Far away from here
A forgotten trace

15:01.286 --> 15:06.124
Of ancestors in me
To be a pocha or not to be

15:06.190 --> 15:09.827
Because I love to hate my flag
And hate to love my creation

15:09.894 --> 15:12.964
Ashamed of Spanish
In the first grade

15:13.031 --> 15:16.100
I'm sorry, mami
 I never meant to hurt you

15:16.167 --> 15:19.170
Ashamed of English
In abuelas embrace

15:19.237 --> 15:21.272
I know you never
Meant to hurt me

15:21.539 --> 15:24.242
Because I'm merging culturas
 Every time I breathe

15:24.309 --> 15:26.711
Crossing borders every time
I speak

15:26.778 --> 15:30.615
Split forever into one
At the edge of two worlds

15:30.682 --> 15:35.253
At the edge of possibility
To be a pocha or not to be.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.854
♪ To have you in my life ♪

15:36.921 --> 15:39.624
♪ Someone there
To treat me right ♪

15:39.691 --> 15:42.060
You going to wear that crown
the whole night?

15:42.126 --> 15:46.531
Yeah. And later it'll be
the only thing I'm wearing.

15:46.598 --> 15:48.299
And a condom.

15:48.566 --> 15:51.703
Don't plan on getting any sleep,
because I can go for hours.

15:53.738 --> 15:55.573
You're not having
any second thoughts, are you?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.142
No, no, no.
Of course not.

15:59.911 --> 16:02.880
Ha-ha!
What the hell's wrong with her?

16:02.947 --> 16:04.082
Zac's not that funny.

16:04.148 --> 16:05.850
She thinks he is.

16:05.917 --> 16:08.586
Ha-ha. Zac, that's the funniest
story I've ever heard.

16:08.653 --> 16:10.288

GINA: Okay.

16:18.162 --> 16:20.632
Your friend's pretty hot.
Shut up.

16:20.698 --> 16:22.567
What? Don't tell me
you're jealous.

16:22.634 --> 16:25.169
I'm not.

16:25.236 --> 16:28.873

No.

17:00.738 --> 17:03.007
Isn't that what
you like about me?

17:13.651 --> 17:17.689
So are you having a good time?
Yeah, so much fun.

17:17.755 --> 17:19.824
I have to use the restroom.
Oh, yeah, me too.

17:19.891 --> 17:22.960
I'll meet you right here, okay.
Okay.

17:23.027 --> 17:25.029

17:30.702 --> 17:33.538
You must be so excited
about tonight.

17:33.604 --> 17:36.174
( sighs ):
I don't even know anymore.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.109
What? You're not gonna do it?

17:38.176 --> 17:40.645
I just don't think I'm ready.

17:40.712 --> 17:43.181
That's cool. I mean,
you didn't sign a contract.

17:43.247 --> 17:45.283
A girl can say no
whenever she wants to.

17:45.550 --> 17:46.951
I just don't want him to think
I'm a tease.

17:47.018 --> 17:48.720
And, you know,
I said I would do it.

17:48.786 --> 17:51.889
Diego's a good guy.
Just tell him how you feel.

17:55.693 --> 17:58.830
( Tiffany moaning )

17:58.896 --> 18:00.732
Son of a bitch.

18:02.567 --> 18:05.303
Maybe I should just have sex
with him and get it over with.

18:05.570 --> 18:08.139
Listen, if you're not
a hundred percent ready,

18:08.206 --> 18:10.074
then you shouldn't do it.

18:10.141 --> 18:12.810
She's right.

18:12.877 --> 18:16.647
But I kind of want to do it.
And I do love him.

18:16.714 --> 18:18.082
Which is it?

18:18.149 --> 18:21.085
Here. Take a sip.

18:21.152 --> 18:22.987

make up your mind.
