THE MOST EXCITING THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME!

31:55.373 --> 31:56.583
Charles: YOU WENT UP
WITHOUT ASKING
OUR PERMISSION, YOUNG LADY.

31:56.749 --> 31:57.834
I KNOW, BUT
I WAS HELPING CASS,

31:58.001 --> 31:59.377
AND BEFORE I KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

31:59.544 --> 32:00.962
THERE I WAS IN THE BASKET.
BESIDES, YOU DIDN'T SAY NO,

32:01.129 --> 32:02.880
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU
WERE SO I COULD ASK YOU!

32:03.047 --> 32:05.717
WELL, I SHOULD THINK
THAT COMMON SENSE WOULD
HAVE STOPPED YOU FROM GOING.

32:05.883 --> 32:07.677
BUT CASS HAS BEEN UP
THERE THOUSANDS OF TIMES,
AND HE'S NEVER HAD ANY--

32:07.844 --> 32:09.262
Cass: IT'S ALL
MY DOING, SIR.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.472

NOT TO BLAME.

CROSSED MY MIND.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.407
I COULD SEE
FARM AFTER FARM,

32:29.574 --> 32:31.451

WAS SO TINY.

32:32.702 --> 32:35.330

THERE'S NO HARM DONE.
