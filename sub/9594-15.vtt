WEBVTT

00:20.688 --> 00:22.790
Oh no, Sparkleface.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.593
The cotton candy growth
isn't growing because there
hasn't been a shower in weeks.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.262
But it rained
just yesterday, Butterbean.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.064
Not that kind
of shower, silly.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.066
It needs a shower
of compliments.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.567
Of course it does.

00:33.667 --> 00:37.138
You're the most
amazing cotton candy ever.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.772
And so delicious too.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.541
Yum! Yum! Yum!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.679
Look, it's working.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.120
Oh no!

00:53.454 --> 00:55.589
That noise is ruining
the cotton candy's
natural fluffiness.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.459
It's coming from the unicorns.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.663
The unicorns.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.432
Ooh, they sound like trouble.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.201
-Hey, Raven, you want
to get in on the fun?

01:07.301 --> 01:09.203
It's just Control Freak.
I'm good.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.505
Ah, come on.
Give it a try.

01:15.809 --> 01:19.313
Ooh, is this a new episode
of Pretty Pretty Pegasus?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.083
Yeah, the unicorns
are playing their
music too loud

01:23.184 --> 01:24.418
and ruining
all the cotton candy.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.554
Sounds like a doozy
of a problem. Ow!

01:26.654 --> 01:28.656
But you know
there's nothing that
friendship can't fix.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.258
-That's what I love
about the show.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.226
-It has such good messages.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.631
It's so nice to see a cartoon
where the characters

01:37.731 --> 01:39.767
don't have to solve
every problem
through violence.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.572
Here's a rerun
of your last beat down.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.474
-Blammo!

01:47.275 --> 01:49.310
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:49.410 --> 01:52.446
Yo, how do I turn
I turn down the volume
on your cries of pain, fool?

01:52.546 --> 01:53.714
Whoa!

01:54.848 --> 01:56.116
I do not know how to make
the television reference.

01:56.917 --> 01:57.751
Whoop-whoop,
hoop-hoop and doop!

01:59.653 --> 02:00.621
Ugh!

02:01.922 --> 02:03.491
Haven't you had enough?

02:03.591 --> 02:06.126
You know what I like
about remote controls, Robin?

02:06.227 --> 02:07.861
If you don't like
what's happening,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.797
you can change the channel.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.870
Where has Control Freak's
remote transported
us this time?

02:18.005 --> 02:20.374
Oh, ooh!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.810
It certainly is
the beautiful place.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.445
Ah, ah.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.748
What is wrong with you, girl?

02:30.384 --> 02:32.553
Uh, did you hit
your head, mama?

02:34.222 --> 02:36.224
Do you know
where we are?

02:36.324 --> 02:37.625
I do.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.294
I've transported you all
to the newest episode

02:40.394 --> 02:42.630
of Pretty Pretty Pegasus.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.800
Thank you so much.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.869
It's a dream come true.

02:50.704 --> 02:50.738
Well, it will be a nightmare.
Because if you can't
discover the way out,

02:51.739 --> 02:51.772
you'll be trapped
here forever.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.807
Really

02:55.276 --> 02:56.910
Yes, forever.
You'll be stuck
with the Pegasuses.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.312
Pegasi?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.680
What's the plural of Pegasus?

02:59.780 --> 03:02.250
A flerd.
It's half flock, half herd.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.851
Holy smokes, you're a nerd.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.253
Freak out.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.593
We have to get out
of here fast.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.895
This place is a breeding
ground for cavities.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.929
But how?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.731
It's a horse show.

03:17.831 --> 03:21.702
So we probably have to hold
hands and talk about the power
of friendship or something.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.337
-Bleh!
-Look.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.539
This world may seem
ridiculous to you,

03:25.639 --> 03:27.475
but these cotton candy bushes

03:27.575 --> 03:29.510
have got me through
some dark times.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.247
Now, come on.
If anyone can help us, it's
Butterbean and Sparkleface.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.293
Oh my gosh!
There they are.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.827
I have to talk to them.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.363
Wait, Raven.
Making contact
with fictional characters

03:49.463 --> 03:51.499
can permanently
alter their reality.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.735
Perhaps Beast Boy
can disguise himself
as the Pegasus.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.771
Sorry, don't do
mythological creatures.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.908
Bro, it's just a horse
with bird wings.
You can do it.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.644
Argh! I guess I could
give it a shot.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.386
Oh, dude, this is agony.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.357
Ow, ow.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.591
Just go talk to them!

04:19.527 --> 04:21.462
Maybe if we give
the unicorns juice
and cookies,

04:21.562 --> 04:23.263
they'll stop playing
their loud music.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.566
That's a great idea,
Butterbean.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.800
Hello, friends.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.868
Oh!

04:35.876 --> 04:37.277
I can't take this.
I've got to talk to them.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.949
Sparkleface and Butterbean.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.684
This is amazing.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.019
You guys are even
fluffier in person.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.957
-My name is Raven.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.692
And these are my friends.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.294
Would you like to be
a part of our flerd?

04:55.696 --> 04:56.997
Yes!

04:57.097 --> 04:58.832
Then lets sing
the friendship song.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.436
ROBIN: Absolutely not.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.872
We need your help
to find our way home.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.840
We'd love to help you.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.310
But we're having
a very big problem with
our neighbors, the unicorns.

05:12.713 --> 05:16.684
They won't turn down
their loud, loud music.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.720
Have you not tried
using the extreme violence?

05:20.621 --> 05:23.491
That's not a way
to make friends.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.594
We're wasting time here.
We have to find
a way out.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.496
Maybe this is the way out.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.330
What if Control Freak
put us in this episode

05:30.431 --> 05:32.966
to help them solve
their problems
and learn a lesson?

05:33.066 --> 05:34.902
Learn a lesson?

05:35.002 --> 05:38.539
That sound like the MO
of that black-hearted
couch potato.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.074
Then take us to the unicorns.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.492
-Argh!

06:02.830 --> 06:04.665
Okay, unicorn brothers,

06:04.765 --> 06:06.967
y'all ready to drop
some more beats?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.969
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
You better bring that.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.038
Then let's do it!

06:20.180 --> 06:21.915
Okay, Titans, here's the plan.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.117
I'll incapacitate
them with some tear gas.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.487
Cyborg, you hit them
with your sonic canons.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.423
No! That's not how
Pegasus solves problems.

06:29.523 --> 06:33.160
We need to talk to them
and work this out together
so we can all be friends.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.467
Fine.
But if things go south...

06:47.675 --> 06:50.010
Hello. Can I help you?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.813
We were hoping
you would keep the music
down a little bit.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.883
I'm afraid we
can't do that, friend.
Nope.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.151
I'm glad you agree
we are friends, but...

06:58.251 --> 07:00.053
Butterbean, please
we'll handle this.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.421
Titans, go!

07:06.894 --> 07:07.828
My horn!

07:17.104 --> 07:18.739
That was scary.

07:18.839 --> 07:19.973
Very scary.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.643
But it made the unicorns
stop playing their music.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.445
I'm so sorry.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
What's wrong with you guys?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.783
You never even tried
talking to us.
Use your words!

07:29.883 --> 07:31.985
But you said
you weren't going
to turn down the music.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.488
Because the loud beats
from our horns
was the only thing

07:34.588 --> 07:36.524
that kept the Gumdrop Goblin
from leaving his cave

07:36.624 --> 07:38.926
and smashing up all the candy.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.164
Huh?

07:44.264 --> 07:46.534
Where's my music?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.872
-Oh.
-Got ya.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.840
On no!

07:52.940 --> 07:54.642
He's gonna be here any moment.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.748
Hurry, you must drop
some more of the beats.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.584
We can't.
You broke my horn!

08:05.218 --> 08:08.255
We get our strength
by playing together
in harmony.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.926
Get it together.
Snap out of it.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.529
We need to focus
on the problem at hand.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.698
You're right. Yep.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.500
I don't know
what came over us.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.202
Those slaps
worked really well.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.572
I liked watching it.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.645
That Goblin's almost here.
We need a plan.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.814
I say we form
a friendship circle

08:33.914 --> 08:35.783
so we can hug him
from all angles.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.185
Or we could
kick him in the face.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.655
Butterbean,
what's wrong with you?

08:41.755 --> 08:45.092
That just seems like the
fastest way to get rid of him.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.160
But, you taught me
friendship and love

08:47.260 --> 08:50.097
are always the best ways
to deal with problems.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.702
Did I?
That sounds ridiculous.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.076
Agreed. Titans, go!

09:13.654 --> 09:16.556
Oh, no.
What do we do now, Raven?

09:16.657 --> 09:20.060
We do what the old
Butterbean and Sparkleface
would have done.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.328
Not punch him in the face?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.230
Good. And?

09:23.330 --> 09:26.133
Have the unicorns

09:26.233 --> 09:28.135
play their music.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.703
Exactly.

09:29.803 --> 09:33.106
But my broken horn
will only make funny sounds.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.978
Butterbean, what do you
have to say about that?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.913
Well...

09:40.013 --> 09:43.684
A broken horn
doesn't matter if you
play from your heart.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.985
Just do your best.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.320
And we'll be proud of you
no matter what.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.723
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.342
It's working but not enough.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.744
I've got it.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.118
I love and value you,
Gumdrop Goblin.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.990
That's all I needed to hear.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.128
-Ya!
-Ya!

10:29.262 --> 10:31.699
Okay, let's pound some face.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.300
Hey, where'd it go?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.935
We handled it

10:35.035 --> 10:36.737
with friendship.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.706
And that worked?

10:38.806 --> 10:40.841
Then we solved the problem
and learned the lesson.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.210
Ah yeah, we're going
back home.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.214
Goodbye.
We'll never forget you.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.052
You'll always be part
of our flerd.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.725
That was really beautiful.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.226
Well done, Titans.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.694
Control Freak.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.929
Titans, go!

11:04.732 --> 11:06.900
-Oh.
