I gotta clean up this place,
so can you leave?

40:08.839 --> 40:11.831
I got nowhere to go.
Go see a movie
or somethin', man.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.605
Isn't there a biker movie
or a "Gidget Ga-Ga
Gets Gooey"...

40:14.678 --> 40:17.408
that started playin'
down at the drive-in?
I don't have any bread.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.450
[Phone Ringing]
I'll give you a dollar, man.
I don't got any bread.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.851
Hey, man, just go take a walk

[Ringing Continues]

40:23.921 --> 40:26.355
The phone again.
Oh, shit.
She can't wait.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.484
Oh, so too much.
Oh, Donna

40:29.560 --> 40:34.020
Oh, Donna
What's happening, baby

40:34.098 --> 40:36.532
Who? DeWayne?

40:40.204 --> 40:44.072
Hi, Red.
When did you get
into town, man?

40:44.141 --> 40:48.703
Oh, yeah?
Oh, it's so nice
to hear from you.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.577
What's wrong?
No, I don't have
no money.

40:51.649 --> 40:55.585
Okay, where are you?
Shit.

40:55.653 --> 40:58.315
What room?

40:58.389 --> 41:00.482
Well, I'll do
what I can, man.

41:00.558 --> 41:03.823
All right, I'll be...
All right, all right.
I'll be right over.

41:03.894 --> 41:06.556
Yeah, sure.
Oh, shit, man.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.598
Hey, do me a favor,
will you please?

41:08.666 --> 41:11.157
It's my cousin on the phone.
Well, he's kinda like
a cousin.

41:11.235 --> 41:14.170
But, well,
like, you know, we...
He's a cousin.

41:14.238 --> 41:17.071
He's really a good dude, man.
Yeah, he's a good dude.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.338
He's got plenty
of dope and chicks, man.
He likes to party.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.608
Why don't you just go over
and party with him, okay?
Should I bring him back here?

41:23.681 --> 41:26.275
No, man, don't bring him
back here, man.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.784
He likes to go to clubs
and concerts, you know,
really get down.

41:28.853 --> 41:31.617
Just go and party with him.
Where's he at?

41:31.689 --> 41:34.385
Oh, oh, he's at the hotel.
Hold on. I'll get the thing
right here. Yeah.

41:34.458 --> 41:38.360
He's over here, man.
Why don't you just go
party with him, man?

41:38.429 --> 41:43.457
I ain't got no dough, man.
Oh, shit. Wait. Shit,
I ain't got no money.

41:43.534 --> 41:48.198
What am I talking about?
He's a Texas oil millionaire.
You'll have a really good time.

41:48.272 --> 41:51.708
This guy,
he's a part of our family,
but we hardly ever see him.

41:51.775 --> 41:54.300
Tell him I said hi.
Don't bring him over.

41:54.378 --> 41:57.074
Tell him that we got
smallpox or something.

41:57.147 --> 42:00.207
Tonight, tonight

42:00.284 --> 42:02.149
[Humming]

42:02.353 --> 42:05.914
#Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey #

42:05.990 --> 42:09.926

#I've got to be a macho ##

42:14.498 --> 42:17.331
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
Okay, man.

42:17.401 --> 42:20.928
Wow, this is a great bike.
Hey, are you sure
I can't buy you a drink?

42:21.005 --> 42:23.838
Uh, no, thanks, man.
Maybe some other time.

42:25.576 --> 42:28.306
Pity.

42:28.379 --> 42:32.338
How ya doin' there, man?
How ya doin'?
Merry Christmas.

42:34.985 --> 42:37.283
Hey, now, wait a minute.
There's got to be some mistake.

42:37.354 --> 42:39.618
I thought you were talkin'
about a week now.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.022
[Clerk]
Ignorance oft the law
is no excuse.

42:42.092 --> 42:44.083
Well, wait a minute.
You just said 37.50.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.755
You didn't say nothin'
about no time or nothin'.

42:46.830 --> 42:50.288
What, do you have no brain?
Well, come on. We gotta
work out somethin' here.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.961
How about I could
trade you somethin'.
You like turquoise?

42:53.037 --> 42:55.471
I got this, uh,
squashed blossom necklace
from the Bisbee mine.

42:55.539 --> 42:57.473
That's gotta be worth
somethin'.
Bisbee mines?

42:57.541 --> 43:00.772
Sir, could you tell me what room
DeWayne Mendoza's in?

43:00.844 --> 43:04.803
- Yeah, I could tell ya.
- Cheech!

43:04.882 --> 43:08.318
Hey, you old piece
of horseshit. How ya doin'?

43:08.385 --> 43:10.819
Goddamn it.
It's good to see you.

43:10.888 --> 43:14.585
Oh, shit, I ain't seen you
in so long! How ya doin'?
Good, man.

43:14.658 --> 43:16.819
Goddamn, you got ugly.
[Laughing]

43:16.894 --> 43:19.488
Hey, it's good to see you.
How ya doin', boy?

43:19.563 --> 43:21.497
I ain't Cheech, man.
What?

43:21.565 --> 43:23.658
No. I'm Cheech's friend,
Chong.

43:23.734 --> 43:26.703
Hey, Ching, glad to meet ya.
How ya doin'?
My name's Red.

43:26.770 --> 43:30.331
DeWayne Mendoza.
Everybody calls me Red though.
You can call me Red.

43:30.407 --> 43:33.865
Hey, did he give you
the money?
No, he... We're broke, man.

43:33.944 --> 43:37.345
He just told me to come down
and meet ya.
He didn't give ya no money?

43:37.414 --> 43:39.405
N-No, we don't have
no money.

43:39.483 --> 43:43.385
Oh, geez.
Why?
What's the matter, man?

43:43.454 --> 43:45.445
Well, I checked in
to this hotel, right?

43:45.522 --> 43:50.391
The guy says 37.50, you know,
so I thought he meant 37.50
a week, not a goddamn day.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.588
Now old Dilbert Dumb Butt
is holdin' my luggage,

43:52.663 --> 43:55.291
and he won't give it up
until I pay the bill,
and I ain't got the money.

43:55.366 --> 43:58.665
Hey, well, let me talk
to him, man.
Yeah?

43:58.736 --> 44:02.194
Uh... [Clears Throat]
Excuse me, sir.
What do ya want?

44:02.272 --> 44:04.934
Uh, why don't you
give him his luggage, man?

44:05.009 --> 44:08.410
'Cause he owes $262.50,

44:08.479 --> 44:12.381
and in another five minutes,
it'll be an additional 37.50.

44:12.449 --> 44:16.146
Yeah, well, you know,
why don't you just give him
his luggage?

44:16.220 --> 44:19.747
Then we'll come back later
and give you the bread.
Why don't you forget life?

44:19.823 --> 44:22.485
Hey, listen, you little creep.
Give him his fuckin' luggage.
Let go of me!

44:22.559 --> 44:25.460
Why don't you let go?
I know you are, but what am I?

44:25.529 --> 44:27.963
Listen, give him his luggage!
Let me go,
or I'll call the cops.

44:28.032 --> 44:31.559
Does it make you feel like
a big man to beat people up?
Give him his luggage, man.

44:31.635 --> 44:33.569
I'm gonna call the cops.
Well, call the cops.

44:33.637 --> 44:37.095
Hey, Chang, come here.
Hey, look, we don't
wanna call the cops...

44:37.174 --> 44:39.108
'cause in my luggage
I got some weed.
Let me kill him, man.

44:39.176 --> 44:41.167
I got some weed
in my luggage, you get it?
Some weed?

44:41.245 --> 44:43.475
Yeah, see,

Just a minute. I'll see.
[Giggling]

45:11.075 --> 45:14.272
Mm-hmm,

45:14.344 --> 45:17.279
Shall I get him up?

45:17.347 --> 45:19.281
[Chuckling]

45:22.319 --> 45:25.186
Irma loves Klaus.
Gimme Klaus.

45:25.255 --> 45:28.418
Hey, Ching.

45:28.492 --> 45:32.428
Hey, how long you know

45:32.496 --> 45:35.488
Yeah, I haven't seen
that old boy in about
ten years, man.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.830
The old shit for brains.
[Chuckling]

45:37.901 --> 45:39.835
Hey, does he

45:39.903 --> 45:41.996
He still wearin'

45:42.072 --> 45:44.939
Man, them low riders

I swear to God.

45:45.008 --> 45:49.604

45:59.089 --> 46:02.217
Man, this is supposed

[Groaning]

46:22.913 --> 46:24.847
Hey, Wild Bill, wait for me.

46:35.492 --> 46:39.758
They're hippies?
Hey, we're just lookin'

46:39.830 --> 46:41.764
Do these rooms connect?
Who is...

46:41.832 --> 46:44.062
[Screaming]
Do something.

46:44.134 --> 46:47.331

- Don't you lay a hand on me.

46:47.404 --> 46:51.568
Oh, Eileen, don't now.
Don't, don't...
You'll never get me.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.202
Don't, don't, don't.
They're big men.
There was a bag,

46:54.278 --> 46:57.338
and a duffle bag
and a tape recorder.

46:57.414 --> 47:01.145
What do you want?
Did you see
a tape recorder?

47:01.218 --> 47:05.678
You'd love to get me!
You touch me, and you're dead!
Shh, don't aggravate them.

47:05.756 --> 47:09.157
We didn't...
I know a lot of cops.

47:09.226 --> 47:13.128
Do you mind telling me
what you do with this?
Don't touch me.

47:13.197 --> 47:15.131
What else is there?
You'd like to touch me.

47:15.199 --> 47:18.965
You're upset.
Boing!

47:19.036 --> 47:21.561
Offenders!
This is not mine.

47:21.638 --> 47:24.129
The police.
This is...
The police.

47:24.208 --> 47:27.234
The police.
I'll kill you before I'll
let you lay a finger on me.

47:27.311 --> 47:32.578
Get away from me now.
[Red] We have the wrong room.
Can you believe that?

47:32.850 --> 47:36.251
I'm talking
to the cops right now,
thank you very much, ma'am.

47:38.155 --> 47:41.522
Yes. This is the real thing
this time.

47:41.592 --> 47:45.528
Come on, please.
There's two crazies in here
tearing up the place.

[Grunting]

47:50.601 --> 47:52.831
Well, what are they doing,
walking over here?

47:52.903 --> 47:56.339
Look, I think
they're Iranians.

47:56.406 --> 47:58.533
Okay, thank you very much.

Okay, here comes the radio.
Be careful with it.

48:18.195 --> 48:20.789
There you go.
All right.

48:20.864 --> 48:22.957
There goes the weed.
Weed?

48:23.033 --> 48:25.501
You gotta be real careful.
Here's the suitcase. Here.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.503
Hey, man, I said
be careful with that.
Weed?

48:27.571 --> 48:31.337
Man, if you break it,
that's worth a lotta money.
Shit.

48:31.408 --> 48:34.002
HolyJesus!

48:34.077 --> 48:36.875

That's all I smoke, man.
I throw the rest of it

48:58.001 --> 49:03.200
Buds, man, look at this.
Yeah, I thought we'd party

49:03.273 --> 49:05.207
You think we can sell

49:05.275 --> 49:07.266
Oh, man, you know how much

Yeah, we had a bunch
oftboat people moved

49:35.706 --> 49:39.233
I couldn't believe it.
I put 'em to work.
They work like hell.

49:39.309 --> 49:42.005

some space coke.
Man, look at it.

This is space coke.
You've never tasted
this before, man.
