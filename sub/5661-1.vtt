Every eve of every hallow.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.346
<i>High time we made a stand.</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:18.079
<i>And shook up the views
of the common man.</i>

01:18.345 --> 01:21.121
<i>The love train rides
from coast to coast.</i>

01:21.381 --> 01:23.861
<i>D.J.'s the man we love the most.</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:26.690
<i>Could you be,
could you be squeaky clean'?</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:29.457
<i>- And smash any hope of democracy?
- Hello?</i>

01:29.723 --> 01:32.260
<i>As the headline says
you're free to choose.</i>

01:32.526 --> 01:35.097
<i>There's egg on your face
and mud on your shoes.</i>

01:35.362 --> 01:39.367
<i>One of these days they're gonna call it
the blues, yeah, yeah.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:44.811
Sowing the seeds
of love, the seeds of love,

01:45.872 --> 01:48.546
sowing the seeds of...

01:50.377 --> 01:51.754
Hello?

01:54.081 --> 01:56.823
Well, in view of the
fact that there is no one

01:57.084 --> 02:00.622
here to seek payment for
this delectable frosty treat...

02:00.887 --> 02:01.831
- Oh, my gosh!
- Ah“

02:02.089 --> 02:04.433
I am so sorry!
Have you been waiting long?

02:04.658 --> 02:05.796
Oh, no. I actually...

02:06.059 --> 02:08.596
I had like a gallon of pink
lemonade before my shift

02:08.829 --> 02:10.809
and I knew I had to wee,
but I couldn't because

02:11.064 --> 02:12.704
I couldn't be late
and I'm a professional.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.134
But it was an emergency and
now my life is in your hands

02:15.135 --> 02:19.481
and we do have a half bath and
we tell everybody that we don't.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.119
We lie, but we do.
We have a commode and a sink.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.452
Would you like to
fill out a gripe report?

02:28.682 --> 02:32.858
Yes. No! No! No!
I don't have any gripes.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.656
- No, your...
- Oh!

02:34.921 --> 02:37.925
Hey, your... your secret
is safe with me, Miss, um...

02:38.158 --> 02:42.300
Goolsby, Miss Bethany Lynne
Goolsby from Haddonfield.

02:42.529 --> 02:47.171
Well, Miss Bethany Lynne
Goolsby from Haddonsfield,

02:47.434 --> 02:51.473
I say that we put this
whole thing behind us

02:51.705 --> 02:55.380
and we pretend like
it never happened.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.320
You're nice!

02:58.545 --> 03:00.957
When you were born,
what name were you given?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.628
- Anson.
- Anson, like Manson.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.660
- Well, yeah, sort of.
- That was weird.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.128
- They totally rhymed.
- It does rhyme.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.801
It totally rhymes.

03:13.126 --> 03:16.903
Well, will that be all
for you tonight, Anson?

03:17.998 --> 03:23.880
Um, yep. Oh, no. Oh, uh, yeah.
Save a tree.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.145
That's so nice!
I frickin' love sorbet!

03:28.375 --> 03:31.584
I frickin' love it too!
It fully cleanses my palate.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.190
- Yeah.
- Oh, um...

03:37.150 --> 03:38.754
Don't. Don't. I'm gonna...

03:39.019 --> 03:41.158
I'm gonna give it
to you for free.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.562
- Hmm?
- I'm gonna give it to you for free.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.600
Can you hear what I'm saying?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.771
I'm gonna give
it to you for free.

03:49.029 --> 03:52.169
Oh. Well, thank you.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.434
Oh, you're welcome.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.702
- Milady.
- Oh.

03:58.004 --> 04:01.781
Oh, come back after the winter
when you've found food for us!

04:02.042 --> 04:03.851
I have found food!

04:04.077 --> 04:05.078
Let's eat it!

04:05.345 --> 04:07.552
I have been hunting
and gathering at once!

04:07.781 --> 04:09.692
I do all the jobs out there.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.759
'Cause I have a
big steed that I ride.

04:12.018 --> 04:14.055
Oh, it's hard to get your
horse to go in circles.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.896
I've always wanted to dance a jig!

04:23.130 --> 04:25.906
You seem like
you could teach a jig.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.111
Well, I was just being honest.

04:35.809 --> 04:36.787
Never mind.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.387
You can tell me anything.
I hope you know that.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.928
Um, okay, would it be weird if
I came and visited you sometime?

04:46.153 --> 04:49.100
Eh, no, not under any
circumstances would it be weird.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.825
It would be,
it would be perfectly yes.

04:53.794 --> 04:59.574
Happy Halloween,
Miss Bethany Lynne Goolsby.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.576
Happy Halloween,
Anson like Manson.

05:03.603 --> 05:06.106
<i>Open hearts.</i>

05:06.339 --> 05:09.013
<i>Feel about it.</i>

05:09.276 --> 05:11.620
<i>Open minds.</i>

05:11.845 --> 05:14.689
<i>Think about it.</i>

05:14.948 --> 05:17.326
<i>Everyone.</i>

05:17.584 --> 05:19.928
<i>Read about it.</i>

05:20.153 --> 05:22.759
<i>Everyone.</i>

05:22.989 --> 05:25.299
<i>Scream about it.</i>

05:25.525 --> 05:26.833
<i>Everyone.</i>

05:27.093 --> 05:29.437
<i>Everyone.</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:31.665
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:31.932 --> 05:33.809
Everyone.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.480
<i>Read about it, read about h.</i>

05:36.703 --> 05:42.153
<i>Read in the books in the crannies
and the nooks there are books to read.</i>

05:49.182 --> 05:54.131
<i>- Sowing the seeds of love.
- Sowing the seeds of love.</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:57.198
<i>We're</i> sowing the seeds.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.529
<i>Sowing the seeds...</i>

06:06.466 --> 06:09.470
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Well, is there a list?

06:09.703 --> 06:13.082
List! Yes, it does matter.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.780
Because it's fucking
freezing outside

06:15.008 --> 06:17.079
and I'm wearing this
ass-tastic peach melba

06:17.344 --> 06:19.881
fit & flare number, Heather.
Be part of the solution.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.990
No way! If I wear a jacket,
I might as well not even

06:23.216 --> 06:24.388
be wearing a costume, okay?

06:24.651 --> 06:26.858
I'm not an Inuit, and plus,
my nipples are poking out

06:27.087 --> 06:30.660
like little Patriot missiles and
that's the fire starter, hmm?

06:30.891 --> 06:34.771
Fuck, dude! It's so cold!

06:35.028 --> 06:37.736
I, like, can't even inhale.
Fuck.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.570
But I thought you
were all over this.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.580
Well, good, because
I can't do everything

06:45.839 --> 06:48.285
while I'm toiling
like a white slave.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.747
This godforsaken fish tank
is gonna be the death of me.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.357
Dumb bitch.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.893
Because I have to clean
the fish poo, Heather!

06:59.119 --> 07:02.293
Yep, I'm a cock-teasing,
fish poo cleaning...

07:02.555 --> 07:03.727
Oop, shit.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.962
Junior college party-crashing
little diva bitty, and so are you.

07:08.228 --> 07:13.200
Hey, we better be on
that fucking list. Jesus.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.255
The illegitimate distortion

07:24.477 --> 07:26.889
of the historical record says
that certain events appear

07:27.113 --> 07:29.923
- in a more favorable light.
- Oh, but surely you make jest.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.993
Napoleon was one of the greatest

07:32.252 --> 07:35.062
military strategists the
world has ever known.

07:35.288 --> 07:39.964
His codes were infamous!
The Army of Portugal cipher.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.638
Bitch, my cousin Deandre
don't even have his GED

07:42.896 --> 07:45.604
and even he can figure out
the Army of Portugal cipher!

07:45.832 --> 07:46.902
It was just a bunch of
missin' letters.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.271
Everybody know that!

08:00.613 --> 08:01.990
<i>Hmm.</i>

08:06.953 --> 08:08.193
Okay-

08:44.491 --> 08:45.526
Nice.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.034
That's right.
Ain't no holes in my game, son.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.470
Little Georgie shoved his whole
arm up your boy's ass and said,

08:53.700 --> 08:57.409
"Hey, everybody, this is Nappy.
He's my bitch."

08:57.670 --> 08:59.308
"You got any bright
ideas, Nappy?"

08:59.539 --> 09:01.644
"Eh, eh, eh, eh.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.049
Oui! Let's go to Egypt!
I want those pyramids!"

09:05.311 --> 09:07.848
George Scovell was lucky.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.591
He was a showboat
and a nincompoop!

09:13.686 --> 09:15.996
- You a damn nincompoop.
- You're a nincompoop!

09:16.222 --> 09:18.828
- You're a nincompoop!
- You are a nincompoop!

09:21.261 --> 09:22.365
You're right.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.438
I am a nincompoop.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.606
- Respect!
- Respect.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.905
You are going to ace this test.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.515
From your lips to
God's ears, my brother.

09:34.841 --> 09:39.586
Bert, hello. Time to get up.
Time to go home.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.522
My phone is dead.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.891
Possibly because I left about

09:50.123 --> 09:53.400
17 longwinded-ish messages

09:53.626 --> 09:57.631
for my, uh, my angel.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.878
I thought...

10:05.872 --> 10:07.783
You know what? I'm good.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.115
- I'm an oak.
- You are an oak.

10:11.377 --> 10:14.586
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
I'm gonna clean it up.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.454
I am nobody's jerk, so...

10:19.719 --> 10:20.891
Absolutely not.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.431
Please be careful
going up the stairs.

10:23.656 --> 10:27.126
You're an oak. Tiptop.
Use the railing.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.598
God.

10:31.831 --> 10:36.143
Yeah! He's had a rough night,
wearing that.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.437
Oh, my God.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.812
I cannot believe he proposed
here, like, that's so shitty.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.611
Got down on one
knee and everything.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.153
Had me float the ring
in a ginger margarita.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.860
- Tequila shot?
- Pretty please?

10:57.423 --> 10:59.303
You're gonna
miss the shit out of me.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.166
This is true.
What am I gonna do without you?

11:10.436 --> 11:13.178
Yo, that shit's nasty.
Where's Julio?

11:13.439 --> 11:15.600
He drove Melissa to the
hospital after her water broke.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.654
That hooker was walking
with some quesadillas

11:17.877 --> 11:19.356
and her shit just
started cascading

11:19.612 --> 11:22.172
- down her legs onto the carpet.
- She's not a hooker.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.454
Then she should be.
The bar empty or what?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.686
No, not yet.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.633
Well, I ain't gonna
be here all damn night.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.735
I'm gonna go out and
get me some candy and nuts.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.402
Wink, what'd you
lock the door for?

11:32.659 --> 11:33.865
I ain't locked shit.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.970
- Well, it won't open.
- So?

11:36.196 --> 11:39.336
So, it has ceased to serve
its purpose as a door.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.307
Then don't think of it as one!

11:42.969 --> 11:44.676
Damn. Fuck outta my face.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.680
Oh, hell, yeah!
Genghis motherfuckin' Khan.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.545
It's true.
At least here I have you guys.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.517
- We're in the trenches together.
- Oh, fuck off!

11:52.745 --> 11:55.589
You think any of us actually
want to be here? Okay, stop.

11:55.848 --> 12:00.388
This is still all about king of
the dipshits, and I've had it.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.758
He was a loser. Seriously.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.524
You are better off without
him and you know it.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.328
You're gonna end up with
some gorgeous doctor

12:07.560 --> 12:09.267
with a huge dong
and a Range Rover.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.406
I refuse to feel sorry for you.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.281
Winketta, do me a favor.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.779
Stop eating for a second,
go check the floor,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.077
and bring Kerry
and Cricket with you.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.263
- Mmm. What's this?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh! Uh-uh. No, no.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.856
You can't give a sista
a little baby piece?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.855
Nobody gets any until
Kerry comes back here.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.002
We're all gonna get together
and we're gonna sing.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.964
"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow"
and next week when you graduate

12:34.220 --> 12:36.860
we're gonna do the same
thing for you, senorita.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.296
All right.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.868
I'll bring her ass back here,
but I ain't singin' shit.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.937
And y'all better not touch
my nachos neither!

12:43.196 --> 12:45.301
Your nachos are safe. Now go on.

12:47.233 --> 12:50.112
I don't understand this thing.
It's not even locked!

12:50.370 --> 12:51.371
That's what I was sayin', homes.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.140
- What'd I tell you about that?
- What?

12:53.406 --> 12:55.283
Going around calling people
"homes" and "esse."

12:55.541 --> 12:56.918
You said I should
grow my lexicon.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.744
I said, be the Mexi-con
with the lexicon!

12:58.911 --> 13:00.032
Now where is the disconnect?

13:00.146 --> 13:01.784
Well, I didn't have any idea
what you were talking about

13:02.048 --> 13:04.088
to tell you the truth,
but now I think I understand.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.128
- Do you?
- Yeah.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.762
- Do you really?
- Yeah.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.307
Because if you're
just saying that

13:08.321 --> 13:10.267
and you're still
harboring confusion

13:10.490 --> 13:11.969
'cause all you think
about is ass...

13:12.225 --> 13:14.466
Tio Chuy. I got you, man.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.298
And I'm gonna be a
pugilist and a gentleman.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.634
One of the two wouldn't be bad.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.811
Is there a shade
past blue balls?

13:23.069 --> 13:25.982
- Stop.
- Yo. Chuy needs y'all in the back.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.912
- Check this out.
- Check what out?

13:28.141 --> 13:31.247
Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the show.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.854
Oh, no, they ain't.

13:34.981 --> 13:39.191
Oh, goddamn! Hey!
Y'all need to break it up!

13:39.452 --> 13:41.329
You think this thing
is a Ramada?

13:41.587 --> 13:43.467
I'm sorry, are you
trying to close or something?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.829
Fool, we've been closed
for half an hour now.

13:46.092 --> 13:49.335
Y'all need to get your asses up
and get to a Ramada, stat!

13:49.595 --> 13:51.040
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.971
We just couldn't seem to help
ourselves, Halloween and all.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.146
Come here. Mm m!

13:58.271 --> 14:00.842
You are the dirtiest
pussy I've ever seen.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.348
Y'all need to skedaddle, now!

14:03.609 --> 14:05.145
Okay-

14:05.378 --> 14:07.221
I fucking told you!

14:10.183 --> 14:11.890
Fucking blue suit!

14:12.151 --> 14:17.658
Emo! What's an Emo?

14:23.996 --> 14:25.634
Is this what I think it is?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.317
<i>Fuck, Bert.</i>

14:41.814 --> 14:43.691
I'm leaving you for Jez.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.024
She's an emo.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.166
She plays in a Siouxie and the
Banshees cover band.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.063
I'm sorry.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.348
Okay, now.

15:05.571 --> 15:10.611
Oh, you guys!
I can't believe this!

15:10.877 --> 15:14.017
I've never seen frosting
on flan before.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.193
You need to pull yourself together
and cut this custard, girl.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.123
Chuy, this is too much.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.022
We know that
you will be fulfilling

15:20.253 --> 15:22.460
your dream of
helping those in need.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.066
Now, that's hardly a
surprise from all of us

15:25.291 --> 15:26.361
who've gotten to know you

15:26.592 --> 15:29.072
and are lucky enough to
call you friend.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.435
Oh. Aww.

15:32.698 --> 15:36.271
- This is from all of us.
- No...

15:40.239 --> 15:43.118
Oh, thank you so much!

15:43.376 --> 15:45.617
I love it! It's perfect!
Thank you.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.199
Oh, no, no.
Wait, wait, everybody.

15:47.246 --> 15:51.217
Okay, on three, okay?
One, two, three.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.897
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow,</i>

15:54.120 --> 15:56.964
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow,
for she's...</i>

16:00.960 --> 16:04.498
<i>I</i> like roosters, how 'bout you?

16:04.764 --> 16:08.302
<i>I like pigs and donkeys, too.</i>

16:08.568 --> 16:12.015
<i>I like cows and I like hens.</i>

16:12.271 --> 16:15.741
<i>I like farm animal friends.</i>

16:15.975 --> 16:18.979
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

16:19.245 --> 16:21.316
<i>Go, snort, snort, hee-haw.</i>

16:21.581 --> 16:23.185
<i>Cock-a-doodle doo!</i>

16:23.449 --> 16:26.328
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

16:26.586 --> 16:28.827
<i>Go, snort, snort, hee-haw.</i>

16:29.088 --> 16:30.499
<i>Cock-a-doodle doo!</i>

16:30.756 --> 16:33.828
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

16:34.093 --> 16:38.132
<i>Farm animal, farm,
farm animal friends.</i>

16:38.364 --> 16:41.368
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

16:41.634 --> 16:45.776
<i>Farm animal, farm,
farm animal friends.</i>

16:49.442 --> 16:54.323
<i>I like farm animal friends.</i>

16:59.785 --> 17:03.028
Winkie.
Something's blocking this door.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.290
Uh, go around.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.333
I need you to find out
what that is, please.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.631
Hell no.
My bunions is all flared up.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.809
Come on, Winketta.
You can walk me to my car on the way.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.410
The freaks are out tonight
and I am a tiny white

17:15.667 --> 17:17.079
ice princess with natural boobs.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.807
Oh! My pinky toe's all mashed
up against my finger toe.

17:22.040 --> 17:27.218
Hey! Yeah, I'm leaving
right now, you concubine.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.084
Oh, my God, Heather!

17:29.348 --> 17:31.555
I'm sorry, I'm being a what?
Shut...

17:31.817 --> 17:34.058
Heather, did you just
hang up on me?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.493
Do you smell something burning?

17:52.204 --> 17:53.205
What in the...

17:53.439 --> 17:55.680
Hey, Cricket, tell Chuy to
call the fuzz!

17:55.908 --> 18:01.051
Aloha! Holy shit! Mamacita!
No need to be alarmed.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.624
I took metal shop in
high school and, uh,

18:03.883 --> 18:06.227
I know what I'm doing
for the most part.

18:06.452 --> 18:07.692
Which is what?

18:07.920 --> 18:11.527
Well, I just welded this
here door shut from the inside.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.634
Cricket!
Cricket, where are you, girl?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.874
Cricket, where are you, girl?
I think she's over there.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.575
Whoop! Eleven o'clock.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.773
Yo!

18:27.306 --> 18:29.115
We don't need another hero.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.581
I got combat skills, bitch.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.881
Now, I do not doubt that.
What is your name, please?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.113
Fuck you! Let her go!

18:34.380 --> 18:36.420
Tell me your name or
I'll be forced to call you Roz.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.849
Dude, you just
totally read my mind.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.588
Speaking of which,
what the hell happened

18:39.819 --> 18:41.628
to Harry Anderson
after "Night Court"?

18:41.887 --> 18:42.831
Live shows in Vegas.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.399
His seats sell faster
than Love and 0.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.502
Well, suit yourself, Roz.
I'm Stef.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.502
The, uh, welding bandit bozo
over there is my brother Anson,

18:50.763 --> 18:52.640
and the lovely pussycat
behind you is Mimi,

18:52.898 --> 18:54.809
the future mother
of my Hello Kitties.

18:56.802 --> 19:02.309
Meow.
Now back that thing up, bitch.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.233
Ah, time for the
backdoor, please?

19:08.247 --> 19:09.191
Maybe nine minutes.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.688
Front door's eleven and change.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.624
You've really become an
accomplished welderman.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.072
Thanks, bro. I'll be able to
un-weld that in half the time.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.193
- Cha-ching.
- That's a hilariously small cowboy hat

19:18.457 --> 19:19.435
you have on your head there,
my friend.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.640
It was a game-time decision.
Sometimes less is more.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.705
- Agreed.
- I think you look ridiculous.

19:24.964 --> 19:25.942
Shh.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.726
You know what, Mimi?
You're a cat, okay?

19:27.933 --> 19:30.277
You're a frickin' black cat.
Don't judge me.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.777
Opel'! Up, please.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.280
You're not putting that orange
in my mouth, motherfucker.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.455
First of all, it's a tangelo
and it's in season. Secondly...

19:38.678 --> 19:41.124
So far, so pretty, you guys-

19:41.347 --> 19:42.325
What do you say we
head back to the kitchen

19:42.548 --> 19:43.526
and round up the troops?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.063
You guys stay here
and get comfy.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.086
You know, I think a bandit clown

19:48.320 --> 19:51.062
with a big ax is pretty creepy.
It's called counterpoint.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.404
Plus the beard adds nuance.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.131
You are so insecure,
Anson, it's revolting.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.136
Was anyone talking to you, Mimi?
No.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.865
Fuck.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.888
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not be alarmed.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.243
- No one will be hurt.
- What are you doing?

20:06.505 --> 20:08.849
Some kind of joke? Come on, hey.

20:18.684 --> 20:23.190
Everyone, thank you! Splendid.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.096
We're about to
have a lot of fun.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.170
- Lads and lasses.
- Overkill.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.586
Yep. Here's the skinny.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.793
We have got a variety

20:50.049 --> 20:51.850
of wacky activities
on the docket for tonight,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.420
but the clock is already ticking
so we are gonna need your

20:54.687 --> 20:56.223
full cooperation if
we are gonna pull

20:56.455 --> 20:57.900
this shindig off in a funky way.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.128
Now, we'd be willing to pull
the fruits from your mugs

21:01.393 --> 21:04.397
if you could follow one
simple rule. Hush it up!

21:04.630 --> 21:06.735
Or I'll be forced to
stab you in the liver

21:06.966 --> 21:08.968
with a Flintstone-sized
beef skewer.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.578
Now, what was the rule?

21:12.037 --> 21:15.246
Don't be shy.
Let me hear it. Please.

21:22.882 --> 21:27.627
Outstanding, you guys.
That was really, really good.

21:27.887 --> 21:28.831
Moving on.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.249
You should all know that the
phone lines have been cut,

21:31.390 --> 21:33.191
the front and back doors
have been welded shut

21:33.292 --> 21:35.052
and as most of you already
know, I presume...

21:35.161 --> 21:37.664
there are no windows
in this cantina pequita.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.603
So basically what
I'm telling you here

21:39.832 --> 21:41.675
is that the stage
has clearly been set

21:41.934 --> 21:43.607
for an old-school
pseudo-European

21:43.836 --> 21:45.440
gangster-style slumber party.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.777
Lady lumps,
have you collected the mobiles?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.954
Hey, Siri.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.485
Guess she couldn't swim.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.352
You are a cheeky minx.

21:57.616 --> 21:58.594
I thought you'd like that shit.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.297
I do. I do, baby.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.519
<i>Uh, pardon me, per favor.</i>

22:01.754 --> 22:04.530
Uh, I'm the manager here
and now I know you said not to,

22:04.790 --> 22:06.870
uh, speak or else you'd
stab me in the kidney, but...

22:07.092 --> 22:08.332
Kidney, he said.

22:08.594 --> 22:12.041
Well, I'm willing to
give you every red cent

22:12.298 --> 22:15.472
the joint has if you just
let my employees go.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.339
Let my people go-

22:17.603 --> 22:19.207
- Go.
- What are you doing?

22:19.471 --> 22:20.471
Let me handle this, mija.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.050
We're not leaving you here.
No way.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.618
Fuck that! I ain't going anywhere
without you, Uncle Chuy.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.687
<i>Mi madre es tu hermana, vato.</i>

22:26.946 --> 22:28.687
Probably be in jail
if it wasn't for you

22:28.948 --> 22:30.450
and the songs of Rubén Blades.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.822
You believed in me
when no one else would.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.623
I will not abandon you in this,
your darkest hour.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.027
- Our darkest hour.
- Shh!

22:37.289 --> 22:38.962
Oh, wait. I'm aces.
Sorry. Never mind.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.171
Listen, you're all
very, very sweet

22:41.393 --> 22:42.804
and I appreciate that and that's

22:43.028 --> 22:44.666
one of the reasons
why I hired you,

22:44.897 --> 22:47.503
but it only takes one
of us to open the safe

22:47.733 --> 22:49.974
and I'm the only one
who has the combination.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.180
That's not true.
I know the combination.

22:51.403 --> 22:52.643
No, you don't!

22:52.872 --> 22:54.215
- I too know the combination.
- Please don't do this.

22:54.473 --> 22:57.044
Yo. I could crack that remedial
shit with my eyes closed.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.755
Oh, hell no. All y'all is crazy.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.184
- Hey. Hey, hi!
- Hi.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.017
Look, you got all the
people you need.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.195
So why don't you just
un-weld one of them doors

23:05.417 --> 23:06.897
and let a sister
catch the next Metro?

23:07.152 --> 23:08.688
- Wink.
- What?

23:08.921 --> 23:09.899
Wait. Why did they weld
the doors shut?

23:10.155 --> 23:11.276
Why does anyone do anything?

23:11.357 --> 23:12.997
Come in, grab the cash,
make a quick exit.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.569
- Isn't that the drill?
- In my experience, yeah.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.028
So why the pseudo-European
gangster-style slumber party?

23:17.162 --> 23:18.197
- Why pseudo?
- Seriously.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.534
Like we're not good
enough for the real thing?

23:19.765 --> 23:20.835
What is the real thing?

23:21.066 --> 23:22.867
Why haven't they asked
about the safe already?

23:22.868 --> 23:26.748
Because these cabrones aren't
planning a robbery, are you?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.043
Oh, hell no!

23:29.275 --> 23:31.186
You guys are adorable.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.549
I mean, the no-talking rule went
out the window in a huge way,

23:33.779 --> 23:38.626
but you're an intuitive bunch.
I like that.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.364
And does this feel
like a robbery to you?

23:58.904 --> 24:03.284
Does this smell like
a robbery to you?

24:15.321 --> 24:18.791
Honestly, it's not like
anyone pays with cash

24:19.058 --> 24:20.833
anymore anyway these days.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.604
- Stop it!
-

24:54.827 --> 24:56.807
What the hell do
you want with us?

25:01.967 --> 25:04.379
We want everything.
The whole chimichanga.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.343
And a little bit of pageantry.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.118
You're gonna kill us?

25:09.341 --> 25:10.979
Big picture?
Yes, that's a given.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.188
No, man.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.045
I should've known
your nasty pasty asses,

25:14.113 --> 25:15.558
comin' in here
dry humpin' and shit!

25:15.814 --> 25:17.452
- No, man! No way.
- I get it.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.492
- Please! Gringo loco.
- I get it.

25:19.718 --> 25:24.167
So y'all is some punk-ass
crazy-eyed killers, huh?

25:24.390 --> 25:27.200
Okay then. Come at me.
Come at a sista.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.063
'Cause I swear on my
grandmama's grave

25:29.328 --> 25:31.569
that I ain't goin' out
without a motherfuckin' fight.

25:31.830 --> 25:32.968
You hear me?

25:33.198 --> 25:36.077
I'mma be throwin' some haymakers
and some kung-fu style elbows,

25:36.335 --> 25:37.615
'cause I don't play these games!

25:37.703 --> 25:40.206
This is some sick
white-people-only shit.

25:40.472 --> 25:43.043
What the fuck are y'all doin'
lickin' and sniff in' on folks?

25:43.308 --> 25:45.811
The fuck? You really startin' to bug!
Come get me! What...

25:46.045 --> 25:51.427
Roz! If you don't pipe down,
you're gonna lose your voice.

25:51.683 --> 25:52.661
Bitch! Hooker, please!

25:52.885 --> 25:55.195
Bitch, if you find some
goddamn needle and thread

25:55.421 --> 25:57.560
and sew my shit shut,
I'm still gonna talk at you!

25:57.823 --> 25:58.767
You hear me?

25:59.024 --> 26:01.004
And you're gonna hear me
loud and goddamn clear!

26:01.226 --> 26:02.426
I will find you in your dreams

26:02.528 --> 26:04.667
and I will hate-fuck you,
Amazon bitch!

26:04.897 --> 26:06.934
Get off me, ho!
Don't touch me, ho!

26:07.199 --> 26:09.611
Get off me, ho!
I will sweat insults, bitch,

26:09.868 --> 26:11.575
if you don't stop
fuckin' touchin' me!

26:11.837 --> 26:13.077
Get off me...

26:18.210 --> 26:20.520
<i>,</i> - Oh!

26:20.746 --> 26:24.717
Oh, shit! Oh! Puta madre!

26:28.887 --> 26:30.867
Well, what the fuck
is this move?

26:33.725 --> 26:37.070
Hey, babe.
I bit out Roz's voice box.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.936
- You did.
- Not much of a box now.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.979
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, man.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.272
<i>Mmm.</i>

26:46.538 --> 26:50.714
Okay. What the hell?
The cat's already out of the sack.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.150
We're gonna eat you guys.
All of you.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.050
The raw, the cooked,
one at a time until

26:55.280 --> 26:57.317
we are <i>so</i> stuffed
we can barely move

26:57.583 --> 26:59.290
because that's who we are.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.394
And tonight's the night we
feast it up banquet style.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.598
It's our tradition!

27:02.821 --> 27:05.995
Every eve of every hallow.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.238
- Sorry.
- Yeah, we're gonna clown around, uh,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.580
and we're gonna come up
with names for... for every...

27:10.629 --> 27:11.664
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

27:11.930 --> 27:13.671
- Every course...
- Yeah.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.276
- Based on who's in them.
- Like, uh, holy mole.

27:16.502 --> 27:17.480
- Right.
- Yeah.

27:17.736 --> 27:18.771
- Right. You know what? Maybe a...
- Psst.

27:19.004 --> 27:20.642
- Maybe a simple heads-up...
- Shh.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.681
Next time before you decide to
grossly break protocol like that, huh?

27:22.941 --> 27:23.976
Do what?

27:24.243 --> 27:25.813
I'm fairly certain that
what you did constitutes

27:26.078 --> 27:27.955
nibbling on the living, and that is...
that is not what we're about.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.284
We have a mission statement,
we have integrity.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.256
Oh, what's the big fucking deal?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.861
We were gonna turn
her into stew anyway.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.359
She wasn't gonna shut up, so...

27:35.487 --> 27:36.625
Stef?

27:36.855 --> 27:38.815
Ah, why don't we shelve
this 'til later, you guys?

27:38.924 --> 27:39.924
Hal Naturally.

27:40.125 --> 27:41.536
Rules are made to be broken.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.204
You stole my
favorite line, okay?

27:43.462 --> 27:44.583
"Every eve of every hallow."

27:44.796 --> 27:46.707
I say that. That's my line.
I say it every year.

27:46.965 --> 27:47.943
Stef, will you tell her?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.888
- You took his line, hon, you did take...
- Because I don't have any!

27:52.371 --> 27:56.012
You have to help Winketta.
She'll bleed to death. Please!

27:56.275 --> 28:00.189
That is a truly ugly picture.
Pennywise, please patch her up.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.550
I doubt she'll be available
for the second half,

28:02.814 --> 28:04.020
though, FY to the I.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.728
Sorry, Roz.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.988
It wasn't supposed to be a
frickin' cannibal holocaust.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.791
Just try to find
your happy place.

28:12.224 --> 28:17.037
Now, Spartacus, about
your request to let the pups go.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.866
You're a leader.
You know what I mean?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.077
You lead. Any fool can see that.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.835
You have the respect and
admiration of your employees

28:23.068 --> 28:24.672
and that is something
that I appreciate,

28:24.903 --> 28:26.905
but it's that same sense
of loyalty and sacrifice

28:27.172 --> 28:28.310
that makes me a
little bit skittish, Chu.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.746
Hmm? Leadership intangibles.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.919
Exactly. It's like having
Gladys Knight or Edie Brickell

28:32.177 --> 28:34.316
- under center for the opposing squad.
- Ah, sports!

28:34.546 --> 28:38.153
But I'm also a sucker
for a feel-good ending.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.726
Remember "Old Yeller"?

28:39.985 --> 28:41.862
' Anyone?

28:42.087 --> 28:42.587
Okay.

28:47.659 --> 28:48.603
What are you doing?

28:48.860 --> 28:52.034
I'm giving Papa Smurf a
chance to save the village.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.879
Did you ever play William Tell
as a little bandito, Chuy?

28:57.102 --> 28:58.843
No, it was mostly
cowboys and Indians.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.017
Oh, I bet you made a precious
little Injun boy, didn't you?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.776
- I was a cowboy!
- Hmm. Progressive.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.019
Not really.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.688
There were no white kids
in the neighborhood

29:05.911 --> 29:07.671
so we all got to be
whatever we wanted to be.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.623
Well, today,
I'm going to be William Tell

29:10.882 --> 29:14.887
and you'll be my one and
only son, Willie, Jr.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.600
If I can hit the tangelo
off the top of your head,

29:17.856 --> 29:19.616
- I'll let your people go.
- And if you miss?

29:19.725 --> 29:22.569
You know, I had you pegged
as a glass-half-full kind of guy.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.705
Anson, my kin.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.412
No, no, no, Uncle Chuy.
Don't, man.

29:29.635 --> 29:32.081
You don't gotta do this! Come on!

29:33.538 --> 29:35.779
No, tio, no.
You don't gotta do this, tio!

29:36.041 --> 29:38.317
Ah. All right.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.716
Here comes the airplane.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.119
Open wide.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.659
- Ah. Atta boy.
- I can't overemphasize the need

29:46.918 --> 29:49.296
for you to remain
completely still.

29:49.554 --> 29:54.333
Whoa. Hey, buddy,
you are so hardcore right now.

29:54.593 --> 29:59.736
Yikes. All right, brother.
All set. Let's do it.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.848
Let 'er rip, babe.

30:15.847 --> 30:19.522
<i>Lover, I don't play to win.</i>

30:19.785 --> 30:22.493
<i>For the thrill until I'm spent.</i>

30:22.754 --> 30:25.997
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

30:26.258 --> 30:28.795
<i>Paint the hole...</i>

30:44.543 --> 30:46.853
I'll fuckin' kill you!
I'll kill all of you!

30:47.112 --> 30:48.455
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.660
Well, I missed the target.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.384
Yeah, but you hit the tree.

30:52.651 --> 30:54.289
Mm-hmm.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.898
Ah! Everybody stays!

30:58.156 --> 31:00.466
- Hooray!
- Fuck!

31:02.027 --> 31:03.973
Well, that happened.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.869
I know it's tough,
but sometimes you gotta

31:06.131 --> 31:07.576
stake the king
to take the castle.

31:07.833 --> 31:09.244
Now, if I had to guess,

31:09.501 --> 31:10.878
I would say that you are the chef

31:11.136 --> 31:13.082
and you're not from around here.

31:13.338 --> 31:14.316
- Oui.
- Well, here's what's gonna happen.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.677
You're gonna follow
me back to the kitchen.

31:15.907 --> 31:17.667
If you try anything weird,
I'll pour hot lard

31:17.876 --> 31:21.483
all over your frog face. Oui, oui?
Now go help your fallen idol, okay?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.853
Lift with the legs. Make it nice.
Show some respect.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.572
Okay, listen up,
Simone de Beauvoir.

31:41.833 --> 31:45.110
- Yannick.
- Yannick? Like Yannick Noah?

31:45.370 --> 31:46.348
<i>Hmm.</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:49.711
The sweetest calves of
all the rackets men.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.716
Well, here's the story.
You do what I ask,

31:52.744 --> 31:54.917
you play ball and you
prepare a feast fit for

31:55.180 --> 31:56.620
the royal family and
I will give some

31:56.681 --> 31:58.401
serious consideration
into letting you live.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.452
If you try to be a hero,

31:59.718 --> 32:02.460
pain will very much exist
in this dojo, my friend.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.861
So, we are gonna play
a little parlor game,

32:06.091 --> 32:08.970
one that has only
gotten better with age,

32:09.227 --> 32:12.868
one that I like to call
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.271
Everybody calls it that,
pinchero.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.912
Well, that's because
it's so good!

32:18.136 --> 32:19.774
Who the fuck is Kevin Bacon?

32:20.038 --> 32:22.951
What? Hello! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

32:23.208 --> 32:27.384
I am laughing at you because
that is so dumb. Kevin Bacon?

32:27.612 --> 32:29.990
Uh, Kevin Bacon is the
center of the movie universe,

32:30.248 --> 32:33.092
and I don't want to hear any
of this bullshit about Brian Cox,

32:33.318 --> 32:35.059
because it's Kevin Bacon,
it's always been Kevin Bacon

32:35.287 --> 32:36.925
and it always will be.
And maybe you'd know that

32:37.155 --> 32:39.999
if you had an ounce of culture
or any interest in the arts.

32:43.328 --> 32:44.528
Eat a hot bowl of dicks, Mimi.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.108
All right, now before
we roll up our sleeves,

32:46.331 --> 32:48.004
I'm gonna need some culinary
background on you, buster.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.904
And don't inflate
the skills, all right?

32:50.135 --> 32:51.637
If you're a one-trick pony,
so be it.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.348
Just shoot me straight.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.414
So what's the story, morning glory?
Crepes or no crepes?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.120
What are we talking
about here, buddy?

33:02.247 --> 33:04.488
Use your words. Go ahead.

33:04.749 --> 33:09.823
My great-grandfather,
Claude Henri St. Eclair,

33:10.088 --> 33:12.932
studied French and
Moroccan cuisine

33:13.158 --> 33:16.765
with world-renowned
chef Jean-Jaques LePen.

33:16.995 --> 33:21.375
He and my father Bob were
at one time considered

33:21.633 --> 33:25.171
the best sauté and charcuterie
chefs on the planet.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.610
And to make along story short,

33:27.839 --> 33:30.183
my sick-minded
doomsday adversary,

33:30.442 --> 33:34.686
I once brought a
57-year-old widow to climax

33:34.946 --> 33:39.053
just moments after she
tasted my boeuf bourguignon

33:39.317 --> 33:44.699
with country vegetables
and just a touch of white truffle oil.

33:46.391 --> 33:51.340
Any more stupid questions,
you minion of Beelzebub?

33:55.534 --> 33:58.845
What reason could you
possibly have for working here?

34:02.140 --> 34:03.380
Who was in blank with so-and-so?

34:03.475 --> 34:05.648
Who was in blank with so-and-so?
Who was in blank with so-and-so?

34:05.877 --> 34:09.085
Who was in blank with so-and-so?
Who was in blank with so-and-so?

34:09.347 --> 34:10.417
Was in... Argh!

34:11.550 --> 34:14.759
Those are the rules.
So, my tribes members,

34:15.020 --> 34:19.867
winner gets to keep their legs
and stretch them. Finish last...

34:20.091 --> 34:21.570
Just get on with it already!

34:21.826 --> 34:24.204
I am totally freaking out
over here and I can't deal!

34:24.429 --> 34:27.239
I cannot deal.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.206
Tuesday Weld. Tick-tack.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.210
This is boring.

34:32.437 --> 34:34.610
Let's kill someone before
I slip into a coma.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.012
Mimi, why don't you
go find some hedges?

34:37.242 --> 34:40.246
Because this is fun and games
time and I have the conch.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.014
Tuesday Weld is a
person or activity?

34:42.246 --> 34:43.887
Wait. Whoa, I got it. I got it.

34:43.949 --> 34:44.949
- No way.
- Super fun. Go!

34:45.216 --> 34:46.695
Tuesday Weld was in
"Falling Down" with Robert Duvall,

34:46.918 --> 34:49.091
Robert Duvall was
in "Days of Thunder"

34:49.353 --> 34:50.924
with Thomas Cruise Maypother,
and the Cruise missile

34:51.188 --> 34:54.068
was in "A Few Good Men"
with Kevin Bacon.

34:54.292 --> 34:55.896
Michael Rooker wasn't
terrible in "Days of Thunder."

34:56.127 --> 34:58.047
Fine! But the movie as a
whole could clear a room

34:58.129 --> 34:59.699
because it was shit on a
plate with no crackers!

34:59.931 --> 35:02.537
Now tell me what
I won, motherfucker.

35:04.936 --> 35:09.043
Round one.
Back me up on this, Roz.

35:27.892 --> 35:30.304
How's that new collar
treating you, my maestro petite?

35:30.562 --> 35:33.133
Extremely uncomfortable
and starting to chafe.

35:33.398 --> 35:36.174
You sadistic
three-horn succubus.

35:36.434 --> 35:40.314
Your insults are surprisingly
colorful, Yannick.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.781
Shall we call this
the Manager's Special?

35:44.009 --> 35:46.455
It's okay, I know you're
laughing on the inside.

35:51.449 --> 35:54.020
Oh.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.048
Mmm!

36:19.944 --> 36:22.117
Credit where credit's due.
You're good, Yannick.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.152
- To the horse race!
- Nice!

36:25.383 --> 36:28.694
And Roz is still holding on,
but frickin' barely!

36:28.953 --> 36:31.365
- She's a warrior!
- Okay, I'm coming in!

36:32.957 --> 36:35.528
All right, you stay here,
keep tenderizing,

36:35.794 --> 36:39.207
and prepare the salad
if you're thinking salad.

36:39.464 --> 36:40.841
But if I'm being
perfectly honest,

36:41.066 --> 36:43.068
tonight's not really
about roughage.

36:49.307 --> 36:50.251
I'm speechless.

36:50.508 --> 36:53.352
I totally underestimated
both of you, especially you.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.057
Manager's Special.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.816
Dude, we have a couple
of genuine cinephiles here.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.393
They have nailed
some really obscure shit!

37:00.652 --> 37:02.412
- Fantastic. Where are we now?
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.767
Lillian Gish for
all the marbles.

37:03.822 --> 37:04.766
Gish.

37:07.759 --> 37:08.863
Not really chewy at all.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.072
<i>- Mm-mm.
- “Mm.</i>

37:10.328 --> 37:13.172
No. We struck gold with
J.C.V.D. back there.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.843
- You guys ain't seen nothing yet.
- I got it!

37:15.066 --> 37:16.374
- Fuck!
- No way!

37:16.601 --> 37:17.944
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:18.203 --> 37:19.443
Okay, okay, okay. Is, uh-uh-uh,

37:19.537 --> 37:21.057
Bacon was in "Diner"
with Daniel Stern.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.047
Stern was in "My Blue Heaven"
with Joan Cusack.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.847
Joan was in "Say Anything"
with her brother John.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.783
John was in "Stand by Me"
with Wil Wheaten.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.389
Wheaten was in "Ham bone and Hillie"
with Lillian Gish!

37:29.614 --> 37:32.288
Wheaten was the... the grandson?

37:32.550 --> 37:35.622
- Yeah.
- Fuck me with a sand dollar.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.730
By God, tell her what she's won!

37:37.956 --> 37:39.401
All right, now don't get
too cocky, but go ahead.

37:39.624 --> 37:44.039
- Get up, stretch it out, do it up.
- I'm so sorry.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.903
Well, Roz was the big loser but
she was at a clear disadvantage

37:48.133 --> 37:49.494
because she was
drifting in and out

37:49.734 --> 37:51.407
- of consciousness the whole time.
- You snooze, you lose.

37:51.636 --> 37:52.676
You bit out her voice box.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.578
What did you expect her to do,

37:54.806 --> 37:56.581
pantomime the answers
with the tied-up arms?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.219
You know, not to mention,

37:58.443 --> 38:02.050
y'all didn't pick one actor
or actress of color.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.782
She likes urban films.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.892
Sew her up and start over
with Morris Chestnut or Larenz Tate...

38:07.118 --> 38:08.998
and see what happens, pendeja.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.764
This unmasked
luchador has a point.

38:12.991 --> 38:17.167
Hmm. I think he's
a little spic crybaby.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.471
Semantics aside.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.080
I for one am growing discouraged

38:25.303 --> 38:27.943
by the prospect of fairness,
moving forward.

38:31.075 --> 38:36.616
Because while it may seem wry,
given the situation...

38:38.449 --> 38:41.623
I do believe in what's fair.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.470
I've always been a fan
of a well placed disco ball.

38:51.696 --> 38:53.801
Any well-placed ball, really.

39:00.104 --> 39:02.104
I don't believe Roz is gonna
be able to participate

39:02.307 --> 39:04.150
in a lot of the activities
we have planned.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.981
At least not in any kind
of competitive way.

39:08.613 --> 39:13.961
So you tell me, Roz.
Does that seem fair?

39:36.407 --> 39:38.353
And scene.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.834
<i>I'm so happy that it's you.</i>

39:55.059 --> 39:58.268
<i>Romeo, a lovesick foo!</i>

39:58.529 --> 40:01.271
<i>I'm so happy that I'm going to
find someone who's realty great.</i>

40:01.532 --> 40:04.775
<i>Uncontrollably uncomplicated,
money and charm are overrated...</i>

40:11.342 --> 40:14.289
That's that sap from the john.
I'll be damned.

40:14.545 --> 40:16.718
Well, fuck, bro. Fuck!
He probably called the cops.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.757
No can do. He wasted his
battery on some whore

40:19.017 --> 40:21.088
who does not reciprocate
his love and affections.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.889
Wow.
I completely forgot about him.

40:24.122 --> 40:28.127
Yeah, probably the story of his life.
Poor fella.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.805
Aww. I'm sure you can relate.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.599
You heathen bitch!
You know, keep that up.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.310
No, seriously. Keep that up
and see what happens!

40:35.566 --> 40:36.636
Okay, easy, bro. Just...

40:36.901 --> 40:40.906
Oh, ooh. Don't threaten me,
you little faggot.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.311
- Ouch.
- Faggot?

40:42.573 --> 40:44.382
She called me a faggot.
What are we, in high school?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.953
Y-you keep that on reserve in
that sweet little vernacular?

40:47.211 --> 40:49.054
What about honky, huh?
What about mongoloid?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.918
You got... you got
mongoloid on standby?

40:51.149 --> 40:53.095
No, but I like it.

40:53.318 --> 40:57.789
I think that might be my
new favorite word. Mongoloid.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.176
- You're ugly on the inside.
- Okay, enough, you guys!

41:00.391 --> 41:02.564
We're wasting silly,
happy, fun times!

41:02.794 --> 41:03.795
Just... just berry pie?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.973
Why don't you go
wrangle the stray for me?

41:08.266 --> 41:12.772
This is so fucking lame!
What the f... Argh!

41:13.004 --> 41:14.847
I'm bored as shit.

41:18.176 --> 41:22.488
<i>Happy that it's you.</i>

41:23.815 --> 41:24.793
I'll make you a deal.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.337
Go grab him,
bring him back alive,

41:26.484 --> 41:27.884
he's your squeaky
toy for the night.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.762
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

41:33.124 --> 41:36.367
Shit.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.034
I think Mimi may
be a sadist, bro.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.337
- Yep.
- Or an extraterrestrial.

41:44.602 --> 41:45.546
Look, I'm sorry.

41:45.803 --> 41:46.804
I shouldn't have
threatened her like that.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.239
- That was way out of line.
- No. It's food for thought.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.814
I just fuckin' love
that accent, man.

41:50.842 --> 41:51.877
I know you do, bro.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.623
I'd go as far as to say
you're obsessed with it.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.886
- I blame Jenny Agutter.
- I know whose fault it is.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.295
Full frontal in "Equus,"
come on.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.625
Full frontal in everything.

42:02.954 --> 42:03.898
- We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.315
I should go check on Yannick.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.560
Let's get Roz outta here before
she starts to bloat and ooze.

42:07.825 --> 42:08.946
What are you thinking? Ribs?

42:09.027 --> 42:11.735
- Rump roast.
- Of course.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.876
Hi. Hi.

42:20.905 --> 42:24.819
Listen, I think... you're gonna
think this is hyperbole,

42:25.043 --> 42:30.391
but I'm... I'm pretty sure
that my life is literally about to end.

42:47.098 --> 42:50.170
Oh, man.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.075
I was such a shit to Heather.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.180
Say what?

42:59.911 --> 43:05.759
My best friend has this huge crush
on this really nice fat guy,

43:06.017 --> 43:08.793
and all I do is make fun of him.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.598
It's not like I really mean it,
you know?

43:13.624 --> 43:17.629
- I think I'm just jealous.
- Of what?

43:18.696 --> 43:22.109
She has the capacity
to be so humane.

43:25.236 --> 43:26.715
I deserve a better
death than this.

43:26.938 --> 43:27.939
Okay, well, look.

43:28.206 --> 43:29.926
Then you better start
brainstorming and shit

43:30.108 --> 43:31.781
because these are
trying times, guera.

43:32.043 --> 43:35.047
If I can get free I'll fuckin'
choke these jotos out.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.259
Well, maybe you should have
choked these jotos out

43:37.482 --> 43:39.484
when they were
holding us all hostage.

43:39.750 --> 43:40.922
What'd you want me to do,
drop those dudes right there and

43:41.152 --> 43:44.395
- have 'em cut her head off?
- Just stand and deliver.

43:44.622 --> 43:48.502
What?
That movie's about calculus.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.005
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.572
I think there's something
that could help.

43:53.798 --> 43:54.776
Spit it out.

43:54.999 --> 43:57.809
Okay, um, sometimes
on rare occasions,

43:58.069 --> 44:01.846
like birthdays, holidays, barbecues,
I'll do a little bit of coke.

44:02.106 --> 44:03.107
But I swear to God,

44:03.341 --> 44:04.411
I feel so goddamn
guilty afterwards it's like,

44:04.642 --> 44:05.916
what's the point of doing
it in the first place?

44:06.144 --> 44:10.991
Because it's fun and it
makes me feel good, that's why.

44:11.249 --> 44:12.660
All right, you just say three
Hail Marys and get on with it.

44:12.917 --> 44:16.490
Okay, fine! I hide my stash
in my panties, okay?

44:16.754 --> 44:19.860
So it's in there
with a razor blade.

44:20.124 --> 44:21.102
You have a razor blade
in your drawers?

44:21.325 --> 44:24.135
Yes, Hector. My utter lack
of common sense just became

44:24.362 --> 44:28.777
- our best chance at not dying.
- Now andele arriba.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.479
Okay, but this could get hairy.

44:30.701 --> 44:32.221
Eww. Try again.
I just got a Brazilian.

44:32.470 --> 44:33.608
It's practically winter.

44:33.838 --> 44:34.942
Just hurry, fucker!

44:36.641 --> 44:38.450
You be gay as the day is long.

44:38.676 --> 44:43.853
You spread your wings
and you fly, you fly gaily.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.059
But be careful.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.489
Please be careful
out there because it's,

44:47.718 --> 44:50.892
I don't know, but I think
the scene is complicated

44:51.155 --> 44:53.635
and there's always a secret
language and mores

44:53.858 --> 44:55.997
and things that you'll
have to know, you know?

44:56.227 --> 45:01.472
And I just want you to be happy and...
think about me sometimes.

45:03.201 --> 45:08.014
Like on Yom Kippur.
Or my birthday.

45:08.239 --> 45:11.550
Hola.

45:11.809 --> 45:16.019
- Que tal?
- Como estas?

45:16.247 --> 45:18.727
Fuck! Okay! Stand up.

45:18.983 --> 45:19.927
No.

45:20.184 --> 45:22.027
Dude, you make me go under there

45:22.253 --> 45:24.529
and I am going to
fucking neuter you.

45:24.755 --> 45:27.895
Oh! Whoa.

45:30.995 --> 45:33.566
Wha... Oh. Ah. Ah.

45:33.831 --> 45:36.175
Good boy.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.940
Now, split your legs,
arms out to the side.

45:41.205 --> 45:42.775
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

45:43.040 --> 45:46.852
Uh, I am a hemophiliac,
so that... you may...

45:47.078 --> 45:49.080
that may alter your strategies.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.452
Uh, uh. No fucking way.

45:51.716 --> 45:54.754
You mean a... a bleeder?
Are you serious?

45:55.019 --> 45:57.090
Do not fuck with me.

45:57.355 --> 45:58.959
Are you a bleeder?

46:00.258 --> 46:01.760
Ah, it's not a hundred percent.

46:02.026 --> 46:04.370
But I am fairly certain that
lam the kind of man

46:04.595 --> 46:06.871
that would clot
properly under duress!

46:07.098 --> 46:10.409
I don't even know what
to do right now.

46:10.635 --> 46:14.981
You are like a deer that got hit
by a Suburban and didn't die,

46:15.239 --> 46:17.412
and then some asshole
truckers came by,

46:17.642 --> 46:19.246
ﬂipped a bitch, parked, got out,

46:19.477 --> 46:21.115
pissed on you swordfight-style

46:21.379 --> 46:22.881
while your little deer legs
jerked this way and that,

46:23.114 --> 46:27.062
I mean... look at yourself!

46:28.486 --> 46:33.595
I'm sorry,
but you are just too pathetic.

46:34.992 --> 46:39.839
I wouldn't go easy on you for
all the tea in China, because...

46:41.766 --> 46:43.768
Fuck China.

46:46.904 --> 46:51.512
Ow! You fucking fraggle!

46:54.312 --> 46:58.522
<i>- Oh, I just died in your arms tonight.
- What?</i>

46:58.783 --> 47:02.754
Fuck. Get it out of there,
just get it already! Fuck.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.126
If I get swamp ass from
all this running around,

47:05.356 --> 47:08.963
- you're gonna wish you were...
- Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!

47:09.193 --> 47:13.141
Oh, my God, right there!

47:13.364 --> 47:15.344
Last supper. I can dig it.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.974
What are you do...
What the fuck are you doing?

47:22.139 --> 47:23.618
<i>Oh, I was wrong.</i>

47:23.841 --> 47:29.291
<i>Oh, I just died
in your arms tonight.</i>

47:29.513 --> 47:32.392
<i>It must've been
something you said.</i>

47:32.650 --> 47:36.621
<i>I just died
in your arms tonight.</i>

47:38.556 --> 47:40.797
<i>Oh, I, I just died...</i>

47:41.025 --> 47:44.370
Ow. Aah!

47:45.663 --> 47:50.476
Au revoir, mon ami.

47:51.502 --> 47:52.640
Psst.

47:58.142 --> 47:59.086
I know it's unpleasant,

47:59.343 --> 48:01.687
but do you remember
the deal we talked about?

48:01.912 --> 48:03.858
You mean the one
where I get to live?

48:04.081 --> 48:08.359
- Yes, sir.
- I have seen all of your faces.

48:09.387 --> 48:10.365
This is true.

48:10.588 --> 48:13.091
We'll have to use
the honor system.

48:13.357 --> 48:14.335
I trust you. Anson?

48:14.558 --> 48:15.798
Oh, yeah. He makes a mean nacho.

48:15.926 --> 48:17.287
I think I could
learn to trust him.

48:17.428 --> 48:20.341
You think I believe
this nonsense?

48:20.564 --> 48:22.703
I do this for my friends!

48:22.933 --> 48:25.504
Because at least this way
I can make them into

48:25.736 --> 48:29.616
something glorious
and delectable.

48:29.874 --> 48:32.616
That is the gift
I have been given.

48:32.877 --> 48:36.256
And that is the least
I can do for them!

48:36.514 --> 48:38.357
For you, I spit!

48:38.582 --> 48:44.123
I spit on the ground
where you stand!

48:54.899 --> 48:56.606
- Awesome.
- That was really awesome.

48:56.867 --> 48:58.228
He was real,
the spitting was real.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.349
- That was really well played.
- That's more like it.

49:00.571 --> 49:01.743
Now we're gonna switch gears

49:01.972 --> 49:03.645
from the raw to
the perfectly broiled.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.581
And I was thinking roast,
but we don't have all night.

49:05.810 --> 49:07.010
So why don't you grab the meat

49:07.044 --> 49:08.365
you think would
be the most tender

49:08.579 --> 49:10.388
and then do something
with a mole sauce?

49:10.614 --> 49:11.814
- It's only right.
- It's just.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.395
And don't be shy about
experimenting a little, okay?

49:14.618 --> 49:16.393
We're game for it,
believe you me.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.156
However, under no circumstances

49:18.422 --> 49:20.629
are you to put
basil in anything.

49:20.891 --> 49:25.169
If you use basil, I will turn
you inside out, literally.

49:25.429 --> 49:27.272
Am I clear?

49:27.498 --> 49:29.409
- Oui.
- Great.

49:29.633 --> 49:35.015
I need ingredients, you corporal
of the devil's royal army.

49:36.740 --> 49:39.516
Well, then you make your
list and then check it twice.

49:39.777 --> 49:44.192
Aah! Ahh! Wait! Wait! Wait!

49:44.448 --> 49:47.292
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Wait! I have a Moped.

49:47.518 --> 49:50.294
I have a Moped!
I'll do anything!

49:50.521 --> 49:53.968
You made me bleed.

49:54.191 --> 49:56.034
No, no you give me
too much credit, l-l-l...

49:56.293 --> 49:58.796
Dirty Birdie, time to fly.

49:59.029 --> 50:01.509
Ow!

50:03.634 --> 50:05.477
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

50:07.538 --> 50:09.142
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

50:12.109 --> 50:13.383
That pinche guera.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.322
Oh!

50:19.450 --> 50:20.394
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.358
Yeah, hit a man while he's down.

50:22.620 --> 50:25.464
Speaks volumes to your character,
pinche puta gringa.

50:25.689 --> 50:29.330
I'm sorry.
I don't speak poverty.

50:30.561 --> 50:34.373
Now, keep an eye on this wanker.

50:34.632 --> 50:37.806
If he wakes up and
starts whining again,

50:38.035 --> 50:41.016
I'm gonna cut one
of his ears off...

50:41.238 --> 50:46.244
and hold you two horny
little loads responsible.

50:46.510 --> 50:49.684
She tastes nice.

50:56.053 --> 50:59.523
Do you think that Ben's
constant misfortunes

50:59.757 --> 51:01.896
are a self-fulfilling prophecy?

51:02.159 --> 51:07.370
Or do you believe that a person
could just be cursed or damned?

51:07.598 --> 51:10.545
Hector. Focus!

51:10.768 --> 51:12.748
<i>Jump in the air.</i>

51:14.204 --> 51:16.206
<i>Jump in the air.</i>

51:18.943 --> 51:22.117
Ah, ah, this... this is horrid.

51:22.379 --> 51:24.052
It was next on Chuy's list.

51:24.281 --> 51:27.194
He just redid the upstairs and
the unisex bathroom, so...

51:27.418 --> 51:30.399
Nice! Yeah, he seemed
like a good dude.

51:30.621 --> 51:32.123
Probably still be kicking it if

51:32.389 --> 51:35.700
he hadn't stepped up
all man-styles like that.

51:35.926 --> 51:38.702
But that probably doesn't bring
you much comfort, now does it?

51:39.730 --> 51:43.701
Okay, anyhoo, uh,
we need some...

51:44.935 --> 51:46.437
"sea salb."

51:46.704 --> 51:49.150
What the fuck is "sea salb"?

51:49.406 --> 51:51.215
Salt, maybe?

51:51.442 --> 51:54.286
Oh. Oh, that's good.
"White panto beans"?

51:54.545 --> 51:56.286
Look at this nonsense.

51:56.547 --> 51:58.151
This guy can't spell for shit.

51:58.415 --> 52:01.919
"Post-granates"?
I mean, come on, bro.

52:02.152 --> 52:03.756
Uh, uh, like, if you're gonna
live off the old American dollar

52:03.988 --> 52:06.868
- at least learn how to spell "salt."
- Well, there is the stress factor,

52:06.991 --> 52:08.470
what with the medieval
collar and chain and all,

52:08.726 --> 52:10.933
plus he has to cook his friends.

52:11.161 --> 52:13.937
Okay, shit, man. That's fair.

52:14.164 --> 52:15.268
I don't know.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.103
I think we have all this stuff,
except for the pomegranates.

52:17.334 --> 52:19.678
The oregano and the
paprika are over there.

52:21.071 --> 52:24.018
Whoa. Little baskets.

52:24.274 --> 52:27.084
Wait, what the...
The Army of Portugal cipher,

52:27.311 --> 52:29.621
the simplest code ever
used during wartime.

52:29.847 --> 52:31.520
Everybody knows that.

52:31.782 --> 52:34.285
Who the fuck is
allergic to basil?

52:35.319 --> 52:36.923
Flan is really weird.

52:37.154 --> 52:40.966
I don't know whether
I like it or dislike it.

52:41.191 --> 52:42.966
Something smells good
over there though.

52:43.193 --> 52:47.664
I'm so glad you approve,
you witch bride of Hecate.

52:47.931 --> 52:50.002
What did you just call me?

52:53.637 --> 52:54.945
Five minutes, you guys.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.015
Five minutes to get Roz's
quasi-orthopedic fucking shoe

52:57.274 --> 52:58.947
off of her bloated-ass foot.

52:59.176 --> 53:02.157
Goddamn triple knot.

53:02.379 --> 53:03.449
I caught the mouse.

53:03.681 --> 53:05.121
Yeah, you did, baby.
Where is he now?

53:05.149 --> 53:06.149
Soaking in his own sauce.

53:06.350 --> 53:08.159
Mm-hmm-hmm.

53:08.385 --> 53:09.363
Now, are you gonna
pull your own weight,

53:09.620 --> 53:11.122
or do I have to do all
your shit for you too?

53:11.355 --> 53:12.595
No, I already did. I halved her.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.236
Yannick can take her
ass from here, literally.

53:15.492 --> 53:18.132
There are no lentils
anywhere, okay?

53:18.362 --> 53:19.898
This is... This is pure chaos.

53:20.164 --> 53:25.170
There's like spices with herbs,
and just like boxes full of just shit.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.575
Ha.

53:30.708 --> 53:34.246
Uh, hello. You got some, like,

53:34.511 --> 53:37.720
"Manchurian Candidate"
shit going on in there?

53:37.981 --> 53:41.929
- No, I'm good.
- All right, look. I know that it...

53:42.186 --> 53:43.665
it doesn't seem ideal but,

53:43.887 --> 53:46.265
uh, I'm actually a
pretty good listener.

53:46.523 --> 53:48.696
So, if, you know,

53:48.926 --> 53:52.066
if you have some stuff that's
bothering you that's, you know,

53:52.329 --> 53:55.538
like not directly related to
the bind that you're in here...

53:55.766 --> 53:59.578
I mean, you know, baby ears.

53:59.837 --> 54:04.047
Well, I guess... I guess deep
down I was kind of hoping

54:04.274 --> 54:06.550
you would figure it out on
your own, that you would...

54:06.777 --> 54:09.917
I don't know,
that you would just kind of feel it.

54:12.116 --> 54:13.891
Feel what?

54:15.352 --> 54:18.060
I think I might be
crushing on you a little bit.

54:20.190 --> 54:21.362
Oh, okay. Yeah.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.868
Well, you know,
that's kind of normal.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.903
You've heard of
Patty Hearst, right?

54:26.130 --> 54:27.302
No. Um, yeah, yes.

54:27.564 --> 54:29.942
But no, not like that.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.043
Like this.

54:39.543 --> 54:41.955
Okay. Okay, uh,
complete transparency.

54:42.212 --> 54:45.159
I met a girl today and I haven't
been able to stop thinking

54:45.415 --> 54:47.895
about her since
I got here and...

54:48.118 --> 54:49.893
Uh, okay, don't get me wrong.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.964
I don't have like herds
of women, you know,

54:53.223 --> 54:55.829
that I'm fending off every...
You know.

55:04.101 --> 55:05.079
So, like, you don't...

55:05.302 --> 55:08.943
you don't think I'm like
a complete psychopath?

55:09.173 --> 55:10.534
Can I be completely
frank with you?

55:10.574 --> 55:12.349
Yes, be frank,
be completely frank.

55:12.609 --> 55:14.089
I mean, sure,
it's completely depraved

55:14.144 --> 55:15.680
and demented what
you're doing here,

55:15.946 --> 55:17.067
and while bearing witness to

55:17.147 --> 55:18.319
my very good friends'
grisly executions

55:18.582 --> 55:21.620
have scarred me for eternity,
I do have a confession to make.

55:21.852 --> 55:22.830
You have a confession?

55:23.086 --> 55:27.501
Oh, bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

55:27.758 --> 55:29.101
Oh, yes, you're blessed.

55:29.326 --> 55:33.274
See... the naked truth
is that I also find your

55:33.497 --> 55:37.138
complete lack of inhibition and
unbridled, primal conditioning

55:37.367 --> 55:40.940
exhilarating and fiercely erotic.
You must be German.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.617
I-I-I am German.
I'm a German-American.

55:43.841 --> 55:44.842
How'd you know that?

55:45.108 --> 55:48.282
I felt it. Oh, my God.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.890
My heart is beating so fast
right now I think I might swoon.

55:51.148 --> 55:53.389
Oh, my God.
My heart is so jacked up too.

55:53.650 --> 55:58.497
Mm-hmm.
And right now I just know.

55:58.722 --> 56:00.861
You just know?

56:01.124 --> 56:02.626
Yeah, beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.999
- Oh, that's so airtight.
- Yeah, it's really intense.

56:05.229 --> 56:06.970
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course, God.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.199
What exactly are
you talking about?

56:09.466 --> 56:11.468
- Fate.
- Oh, fate.

56:11.702 --> 56:14.080
- Brought us together.
- So mysterious.

56:14.338 --> 56:17.376
Because I guess
I could put the thing

56:17.641 --> 56:20.315
with Bethany on hold... Mm-hmm.

56:27.484 --> 56:29.020
Oh, fuck.

56:30.854 --> 56:33.562
I hate that bitch Mimi and
the way she talks down to you.

56:33.824 --> 56:36.566
I hate that bitch.

56:36.827 --> 56:40.331
Yeah.
She is a bad person, right?

56:40.564 --> 56:44.171
Yeah, but not you.
You're a romantic.

56:44.401 --> 56:47.939
I am. I'm totally a romantic.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.911
Oh, it's been such a hard year.

56:51.174 --> 56:52.118
It really has.

56:52.376 --> 56:55.448
I mean Mimi's totally
thrown off the mix.

56:55.712 --> 56:57.885
And I'm just not
sure how much longer

56:58.115 --> 56:59.856
I'm cut out for this
game, you know?

57:00.083 --> 57:02.563
It's getting way harder
to find places without

57:02.786 --> 57:07.929
security systems or windows.
I don't know.

57:08.191 --> 57:09.864
Oh, no. I've said too much.

57:10.093 --> 57:13.597
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You haven't said enough.

57:13.864 --> 57:17.311
Yeah. Yeah, pinch it really hard,
right on the bottom.

57:17.567 --> 57:19.205
Like Lou Ferrigno.

57:19.436 --> 57:21.116
Goddamn it, Hector,
what is taking so long?

57:21.371 --> 57:22.732
This razor blade's
all dulled down.

57:22.806 --> 57:25.007
How much blow were you chopping
with this thing, gringa?

57:25.042 --> 57:25.986
It's been a long
semester, Hector.

57:26.243 --> 57:28.052
Like you're a bastion
for lawful behavior.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.416
At least I don't have
a permanent record.

57:29.646 --> 57:32.149
Hey. That stings, all right?
I've turned a corner.

57:32.416 --> 57:34.418
I take all my hostilities
in the ring now.

57:34.651 --> 57:35.629
It's called an outlet.

57:35.886 --> 57:38.560
Okay, well, congratulations.
You're all growns-up.

57:40.590 --> 57:42.763
Come watch me fight if you want.

57:42.993 --> 57:45.940
Lots of times they
serve snow cones.

57:46.163 --> 57:47.642
Plus I'm undefeated.

57:49.599 --> 57:51.909
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:52.970 --> 57:54.347
You fight any black dudes?

57:54.604 --> 57:58.814
Yeah. Like, three.

58:05.349 --> 58:06.327
So you, uh...

58:06.583 --> 58:12.033
You want to maybe, um,
go on a date with me?

58:13.190 --> 58:18.640
Like a proper date if we...
if we don't croak tonight?

58:18.862 --> 58:21.706
You're, like, old enough to have

58:21.965 --> 58:23.876
been kicked out of Menudo.

58:26.203 --> 58:28.615
So are you saying
there's a chance or...

58:28.839 --> 58:32.946
Yes. I mean, yeah.
What the fuck.

58:33.176 --> 58:35.383
You've already
been to third base.

58:37.781 --> 58:39.624
Yeah.

58:39.850 --> 58:41.610
As long as we don't have
to eat Mexican food.

58:41.785 --> 58:44.322
No, no. We can, uh,
do Korean barbecue?

58:44.554 --> 58:48.525
Yeah. Cool.
That sounds really nice.

58:54.197 --> 58:57.804
<i>If you close your eyes
and you still feel the demons.</i>

58:58.035 --> 59:01.539
<i>Chewing at your brain
and gnawing your shoe.</i>

59:01.805 --> 59:04.581
<i>Just tel! Them to go
and find someone...</i>

59:04.841 --> 59:07.879
Where do you stand on purees.
Purees are general.

59:08.145 --> 59:09.249
Oui, oui.

59:11.181 --> 59:15.493
Your puree is out of luck.
More of a standard mash...

59:15.719 --> 59:17.164
What's happening to me?

59:19.256 --> 59:21.395
- Am I dead?
- Pipe down, gay Sammy.

59:21.658 --> 59:22.659
We're in the middle
of a powwow here.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.395
Okay, okay, sorry.

59:26.530 --> 59:27.600
Wait. Si r?

59:27.864 --> 59:30.344
I'm gonna bleed to death maybe.

59:30.567 --> 59:33.047
Just shut your ass and
think of something plush.

59:34.738 --> 59:39.915
Chewbacca. Chewbacca.

59:54.558 --> 59:57.971
<i>Mm, yeah.</i>

59:58.228 --> 01:00:01.266
<i>I used to think
maybe you loved me.</i>

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.569
<i>Now, baby, I'm sure.</i>

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:10.583
Holy crusty moly.
That is a rump roast, Yannick.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.480
Baby got back!

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.085
That is tender as fuck!

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.815
What the fuck.
What the fuck, baby.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.924
Mm-mm-mm. My butt's in the air.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.562
My butt's in the air
for this one, baby. Mmm!

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.129
Tender as the night.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:25.559
Mmm!

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:27.496
- Bam, motherfucker!
- Bam, motherfucker!

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:28.997
Yannick, seriously, dude.
Spill the beans.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.569
Why are you working here,
man, why?

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.469
Hey! Oh, you guys
started eating without me?

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:35.732
Hop in here, brother.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:39.470
All right, well,
I've got some white panto beans.

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.841
No dearth of those around.
Whoa, hey!

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.676
You hung the stray upside down.
That's kind of neat.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:48.150
Kind of an homage to the
traditional Mexican pinata.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.918
Mmm! Mmm!

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.669
- Is it not on point, man?
- Holy shit!

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.820
And you know,
we'd be halfway through

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:56.605
prepping the next entree
if you weren't

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:57.664
in the pantry
for a fucking hour.

01:00:57.921 --> 01:00:58.865
Why were you in there
for so long, man?

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.829
Well, I need to cool
it down with you

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:04.163
and have a little sidebar asap,
ASAP, as soon as possible.

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.498
Well, pumpkin, uh,
I will be back in a flash.

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:09.175
Keep an eye on quarterback
princess, will you?

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.337
I got this.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.773
The bartender pulled out
her sweater pups and

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.521
- you split the diff, didn't you?
- I didn't split the difference...

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:27.727
- Come on.
- But check this out.

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:29.691
- She put her finger in my mouth space.
- And you bit it off.

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:31.455
She put her finger
in my mouth space.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.168
- And you bit her finger off.
- No, brother. That's the kicker.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.330
- Proceed.
- Our sociopathic behavior and

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.972
our fetish for human
ﬂesh makes her all horny.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.676
She used the word
horny from the '70s?

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.931
Talk about looking for the
fastball and getting hosed...

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.134
- Ooh.
- With the knuckle curve.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.472
- Sports.
- She gave me the kissy face.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.307
She gave you the kissy face?

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.619
She gave me the kissy face.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.375
She gave you the kissy face!

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.681
She gave me the
kissy face, she gave me...

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:54.864
She gave you the kissy face!

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.582
Wait a minute, what about Brittney
from the convenience store?

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:58.006
- Come on.
- Bethany, Bethany.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.855
- Bethany. Bethany Lynne Goolsby.
- Sweet.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:01.690
You see, brother?
This is what I'm saying.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.118
It's too much. Two in one day?

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:04.733
Yeah, well,
it's too much for any man.

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.861
No, no, I-I was shvitzing.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.057
- Is my face hot?
- It looks flush.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:08.964
You should hydrate
with some electrolytes.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.404
Well, buddy.
I'm not blind, you know.

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.546
It's been tough on you since
I brought Mimi into the mix.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:24.775
I love you, and I'm grateful to
you for making this transition.

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:28.750
Hey. It makes me proud.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:30.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.494
Well, here I am,
the big brother,

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.550
and you know I'm always
coming to you for stuff.

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:34.761
- No.
- No, it should be

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:36.861
- the other way around, you know?
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.607
Who taught me how
to play the mandolin?

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:39.766
I did.

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:40.967
Who taught me how to
play the mouth harp?

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.504
- Me.
- Who taught me how to play

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:43.537
the theremin?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.535
- That was Dad.
- Shit. That was Dad.

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:50.443
Shit.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.581
But the mandolin.

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:55.782
- Yeah, that was all you.
- Well, you've got the gift.

01:02:56.039 --> 01:02:57.143
Thank you very much,

01:02:57.407 --> 01:03:00.081
but pretty soon we're both
gonna have nice girls, okay?

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.830
And we're gonna be
playing folksy tunes

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.111
for them at our anniversaries.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:07.584
But in the meantime I just
want you to be cautious, okay?

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:09.888
This Bethany girl seems
like a real sweetheart,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.241
but the powder puff chick...

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:12.481
- Oh, come on.
- I don't know.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.228
It's just like you
and Mimi last year.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.266
Well, we met under
similar circumstances,

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:19.736
but it was clear from the get-go
that the Mimes was on the level.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.489
Yeah, that's the understatement
of the young millennium.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.501
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, bro, put her on a leash!

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.761
- Aww.
- No.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.941
She's like the Marquis
de Sade with Asperger's.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.507
Part woman, part razorback.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.608
Just a little bit, but-but-but
just try walking in her shoes

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.812
for a second, would you?

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.013
- I won't.
- Just try it.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.214
- I won't!
- Try it for me right now.

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:02.631
- This moment.
- Fine, I will.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:03.650
Thank you.
She's a bit taller. Can you...

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:04.873
All right, I can do that.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.949
Straighten your back.
Yeah. The swan-like neck.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.178
- Oh, yeah. Aah! Aah!
- Now what is that?

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.890
Why are you doing that?

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:11.124
Well, you gotta imagine
fire coming out of my mouth.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.793
No, no, no.
This is an exercise in empathy.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.622
Now you're mocking my girlfriend.
Come back to me.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.132
This is her maiden voyage, okay?

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.921
She's trying to find
a place on the team.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.398
She's nervous, she's defensive.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:22.500
She's overcompensating
just a little bit.

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:24.006
You've heard me say this before.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:28.004
There are no substitutes
for brown sugar or...?

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.374
- Enthusiasm.
- You got it.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.046
I got it.
Okay, but you know what?

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.505
I am just a little scared
she might kill me in my sleep.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:37.583
There is no way
that would happen.

01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:40.321
Because if it did,
I would kill her right back.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.943
And then I would
gouge her eyes out,

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.649
and then I would pickle your
head and put it on a stick

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.223
so you would always be with me.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:47.655
I'm getting to Greek tragedy now.
It's a bit trite. I'm sorry.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.522
All right, so what's
my play with Kerry?

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.494
Should I put gum in her hair?

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.696
- No, don't do that.
- All right.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.063
What you want to do is
you want to spend some time with her,

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.829
you want to find
out if she's legit.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.872
But remember she's your
responsibility, brother, okay?

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.771
You got the ball, so...

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.775
- See if she's the belle.
- Thank you.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:11.045
You had some
fun with Roz here, huh?

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:12.554
I did that for you, big brother.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.514
Hey, Roz, we're gonna
go in the other room.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.348
You gonna hang here?

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.918
Hi-yah!

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.895
See?
That's what I'm talking about.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:37.210
Yannick? I know you and
Roz were bosom buddies.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.880
- She was one of a kind.
- My sentiments exactly.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.310
Be a shame to waste
these getaway sticks.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.550
They're like freaking redwoods.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.754
You like, uh, chili?

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.546
Does the pope shit in the woods?

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.758
Ooh!
We got plans for those dogs?

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.756
Look, this piggy went to the market,
stayed for lunch.

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.903
I could use these in the
next immunity challenge.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.792
Trick or treat,
smell these feet.

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.055
Oh, my goodness.
I love that idea.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.826
Take your girl, get it started.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.593
All right, campers.

01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:06.671
Before each of you is one
of Roz's thick-ass tootsies

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.240
that I hacked off like a champ.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.447
And the game is, lean in nice

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.580
and gnaw through
your designated foot.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.080
The first one to hit bone wins

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.753
a bathroom break
and a shot of Baileys!

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:20.954
We don't have Baileys.

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.919
- Shit! Do we have Frangelico?
- Yes.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:26.286
And a shot of Frangelico!

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.203
That is unlike anything
I have ever tasted,

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.636
yet still undeniably
chili-esque.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:40.696
Babe, you gotta try this.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.673
My squeaky toy passed out.
Can we set him on fire?

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:47.881
- No.
- Like... friendly fire.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.707
Please.

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:51.774
Come on, take a little nibble.
Touch that toe.

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:53.852
Eat that toe.
Look at that big toe.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.390
You haven't ever
tried it before.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.647
How do you know
you don't like it?

01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:00.191
Well, how about you, Hector?
Get in there! You're the man!

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.361
If anyone can do this,
Hector can!

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.300
Come on, babe!
I feel like all alone out here.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.523
You wanna get in on this?

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:08.862
I feel like you're really
holding back on me.

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.628
Oh, yeah. Come on, slut!
Eat it! Do it!

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.204
What the fuck,
you sellout bitch?

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:16.637
- I hate you!
- Oh, this is so fucking awesome!

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:17.844
See? That's nice.
We make out like that.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.137
Oh, yeah! Yeah! All right.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.973
Come on, Hector! Don't hold back!
Don't be a little bitch!

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:22.649
Like you didn't chow
on worse shit in prison.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.818
Oh, shit! Oh, snap!

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.331
This is how they do it in
Matamoros. Pinche! Oh!

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.869
Hector! No, no, Hector! No more.
He's unconscious.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:48.166
- We've gotta get out of here!
- Fucking untie me now, please!

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.844
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay. Oh. Here's my pitch. Okay.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.570
Chuy just installed that little
A.C. unit in the wall upstairs.

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:56.282
We push it out and maybe
we can get out through the hole.

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:57.779
Holy shit! That's amazing. Yes.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.076
Wait, wait, wait.
What about Yannick?

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.788
- He's alive. So is Bert.
- Bart's on his own. No.

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:03.683
Look. Okay, look.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.891
You two get out of here,
all right?

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:07.287
Call the cops, don't look back.
I got this.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.111
Hector, wait!
Please, please be careful!

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:12.765
I will not go out with you
if you're dead or all fucked-up looking!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.081
Oh. Whoa!
Did he just beat me with a foot?

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:29.112
Yeah, but you're okay,
thank God.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.113
Cricket! Cricket, you all right?

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:32.478
Come on!

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:34.948
You ready to squabble, Mexicali?

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.656
Not in front of the ladies.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.587
Oh, well, fine then.
Let's take it upstairs.

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.456
There's more real
estate down here, bitch.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:47.729
Well, but I really need to tinkle
before I beat you to death.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.335
- Wish me luck, babe.
- Luck.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.666
After you, Tito Santana.

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:57.073
This is turning
into a snooze fest.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.645
We have killed, like,
like, two people.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:04.850
Why don't you just...
just try the fuckin' chili?

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.992
Whoo! That's more like it.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:27.828
Oh, man,
look at this big long table

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.841
right in the middle
of our thunder dome.

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:32.136
Yeah, it's for
quinceaneras and shit.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.953
You don't look so hot,
Lord of the Flies.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:43.823
Yeah, it's bizarre.

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:46.459
I get this pressure
behind my ears, Yannick.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.685
Followed by a swelling
of the lymph nodes

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:52.160
and a gradual closing
of the windpipe.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.692
I do not follow you,
Old Scratch.

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:59.565
Give me that list, man.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:04.901
Give me the list!

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:11.008
- Hal.
- Got it, got it, got it.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.516
Ha! Oh. My God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:16.087
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I knew you were full of shit!

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:20.487
Hal I pulled exactly the
same move last year!

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:24.028
The difference is I walked
the fucking walk!

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.859
- What the fuck happened to your accent?
- I know. It's good, huh?

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:29.730
Stefan is a total fucking
sucker for a British chick.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.529
So you're actually two
psychos for the price of one.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.105
What a fucking bargain!

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:35.501
I guess.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:39.938
Oh, that's nice.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.183
We doing this like men or like
pussies with axes and shit?

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:46.886
Yah!

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.870
No. No. I'm sorry.
That was... that was mean.

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:50.718
Here,
I'll leave this right there.

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.294
"Sea salb" and "post-granates."

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.464
It's the Army
of Portugal cipher.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:01.065
So simple.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:04.438
Oh, fuck.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:07.072
You snuck a dash of basil
in there, didn't you, Yannick?

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:11.904
I myself have dabbled in
the business of diabolique.

01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:15.378
- Surely you jest.
- A culinary prodigy like myself.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:19.747
How else do you explain me
working in this casket of shat?

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.616
I have been asking you
that shit all night, Yannick!

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.222
You withholding asshole!

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:25.528
What the fuck is she doing?

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.558
I don't know, but you being
in front of me feels right.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.924
Ooh! Ah.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:33.998
Okay! I float like a butterfly,
sting like a...

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.767
I used to have my own
bistro in Laguna Beach.

01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:44.741
Only one house rule.
Absolutely no substitutions.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.345
Aah! Oh, yeah.

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.844
Nice on, cabron. Landed flush.

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:51.141
Yeah, it did.

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:53.318
It was a Thursday.

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.180
I was of course in the kitchen

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:57.856
preparing a
six-course fugu feast

01:11:58.114 --> 01:12:01.425
featuring the
exotic puffer fish.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.597
- That's the poisonous one.
- Oui.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.427
This idiot insists
that the fugu skin

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.469
be drizzled with ponzu
sauce for added flavor.

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:13.654
Yannick, you're gonna
need to cap this story, bro.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.639
I gotta castrate you
before my face implodes.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:17.435
All right.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.977
Disco.

01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:23.676
Bloodbath.

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:26.776
Boogie.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:31.287
Somehow, poison from
the liver of the puffer fish

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.290
made it into the zosui.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:37.157
One bite later the son
of a bitch was dead.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:40.859
Oops.

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.403
Well, butter my biscuit,
Yannick,

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.233
because you broke
my one and only rule.

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:48.202
And you know what that means.

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:48.964
Fever!

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.219
Come on! Come on!

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.902
Fuck you, bitch!

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.105
Sorry, Kerry!

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:23.037
Getting on this bitch
was a bad fucking idea!

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:29.917
All right, this is lame baggins.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:33.016
How does that feel, Yannick?
Tell me how that feels.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.586
I'm sending you home, man.

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:38.189
You like it? Do you like...

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:42.419
Oh, shit!

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:50.094
<i>When disc-goes to hell.</i>

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.033
<i>That's where we're at,
where we're at.</i>

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:56.938
- You're like a cockroach!
- I'm a cricket!

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:15.089
Ow! Why would you do that, man?

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:22.895
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.002
Way, Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay!

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:31.571
Hey, why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:32.779
Huh.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.477
<i>Disco this.</i>

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:42.347
<i>Disco that.</i>

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.352
<i>Disc-goes to hell.</i>

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:47.093
<i>That's where we're at,
where we're at.</i>

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.854
Shut your eyes, Liberace!

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:57.467
We clearly had a
falling-out, Yannick!

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.488
No, no, no, no!
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.154
Fuck, Kerry, I'm sorry!
You were supposed to fucking hold her!

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:22.787
I'm sorry! Get up! Get up!

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.966
Well, you really blew
the shit out of that one.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.799
Now, how shall we do this?

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.304
Is there a single scenario
where I don't die?

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.912
Fine.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:46.085
But no more blood, seriously.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.183
I can respect that.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:58.190
No holds barred, joto.

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:04.033
Please tell me you've
seen "Road House."

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:12.943
You think this is fuckin' funny,
you sick son of a bitch?

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:15.773
I do now.

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:38.938
<i>Oh, Ruck. Whoa'.!</i>

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:44.142
Well, that totally worked.
Yeesh.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.043
Oh, fuck.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:56.086
It's time for one of us to die.
You know this.

01:16:56.312 --> 01:17:00.158
- Fuck yeah.
- But which one?

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:03.954
I nominate me...
and vote for me.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.913
Fuck! Ow!

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:42.026
<i>You don't call anymore.</i>

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:47.172
<i>You don't knock on this door.</i>

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:51.002
<i>Just picture you.</i>

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:56.216
<i>Out there without me.</i>

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.677
<i>Breaks my heart...</i>

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.115
Oh, God, Cricket.

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.793
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.189
Hey!

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.055
Oh, God, fuck.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.326
Miss Behavin' ran outta air.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.239
<i>Cry baby.</i>

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.078
<i>Ram</i>

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:33.848
<i>cry baby...</i>

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:37.182
Oh, it's hard to
take you seriously

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.393
with that humongous camel toe.

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:42.754
You're not funny, you asshole!

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:46.329
I have a long labial
It's genetic!

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:00.880
This is what it
feels like to die.

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:04.107
Now go to hell, and take
your giant pussy with you.

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:36.109
Ah. Ha. This is for Cricket.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:45.487
Yeah. I'm not sure if Mimi
recovers from that one.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.262
Yeah, she'd really
worn out her welcome.

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:53.160
Yeah. Well, trust me.

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:59.065
You just saved Stef a fuck-load
in couples therapy.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:02.572
Aw.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.904
I'm sorry about Cricket.
You okay?

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:08.479
Yeah. Never better.

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.774
I'm assuming you
took care of Hector?

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:14.180
Uh, yeah.
Kid had chutzpah though.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:20.257
And a hell of a ground attack.
Yep, that's my bone.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:22.817
The kid got cocky though.

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:25.760
He tried to bust out
some old-school Swayze.

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:27.789
The kind of mistake he
could have learned from

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:31.199
if I hadn't turned his skull
into a kayak.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.371
Come hold hands with me.

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:37.202
Uh, y-yeah.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.145
Whoa!

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:55.626
Kriss Kross will make you...
jump.. jump. Jump-

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.660
Oh, bro!

01:20:57.886 --> 01:21:01.163
It looks like you... you took
some lumps there too, huh?

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.370
You got a big ol' pumpkin head.

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:08.701
Oh, all right. Brace yourself.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:16.339
I got some tough news.
Mimi's dead.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:20.852
I know, I know.

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:23.886
- "Babil."
- I know... Babil.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:25.090
"Babil."

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:27.554
I know... she's a sweet,
sweet Babil, but listen.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:28.760
We're gonna miss her.

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:32.157
But I gotta tell you she didn't
deserve you, okay, man?

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.388
I'm not afraid to say it.

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:36.934
No, you... you have so much
more to offer than that.

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:40.264
"Babil"! "Babil"!

01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:42.031
Sea salb. Panto beans?

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:43.607
I mean, we brought up
everything they had.

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:47.712
Hmm! The Army of
Porthugal cipher.

01:21:49.438 --> 01:21:52.078
The Army of Porthugal cipher!

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:55.288
She did this!

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:57.114
I can't understand
what he's saying.

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:59.017
Can you? Can you understand?

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.524
I think what he's trying to
say is that I'm the only one

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.855
who could have
delivered the basil.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:15.302
No, Stef! Stef, no! Breathe!
Breathe! Breathe, Stef!

01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:17.305
Aah!

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:18.772
You fuckin' bitch!

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.275
You lied to me!
I trusted you and you lied to me!

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:22.709
Yeah, guilty as charged.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.779
I'm not really attracted
to dickless cannibals.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.113
That's not true! I have a dick!

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:30.749
I'm gonna fuckin'
kill you, I swear!

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:33.459
(Wagging) Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.558
Oh, Stef! Stef, breathe!

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.491
Breathe!
I'm here, little brother!

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:41.428
You're okay! It's okay!
Just breathe!

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:44.831
Hey! Please! Please!
Please! Please!

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:46.733
I don't know what to do.
I'll do anything.

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.670
He needs an airway.
Tracheotomy time.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.574
Well, you're... you know!
You're a paramedic!

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.681
You, it's your responsibility!
You have to help!

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:57.010
Yeah, I don't start 'til Monday.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:03.620
It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay, Stef. No, no.

01:23:03.846 --> 01:23:05.985
I'll be here with you,
little brother.

01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:09.491
It's okay. I'll...

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:15.264
It's okay. I'm with you, bro.

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.869
I'm right here.
Don't be scared, okay?

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.936
I'll stay right here with you.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:24.636
Okay. Come on, come on.
You've gotta help me, Bert.

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:26.347
- You're an oak, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:29.038
- I cannot carry you up the stairs.
- Well, I'm sorry!

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:30.942
I don't know why
I'm still alive either!

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.777
It doesn't add up!

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:43.351
Fuck!

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.391
Well, that's not
gonna do anything.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.808
Are you out of your fucking mind?
He's got an axe!

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:02.413
- Fuck! Just...
- Hurry! Hurry!

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.914
I got it. I got it.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:07.881
What is it? Did you get a gun?

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.521
- Shut up.
- What is that?

01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:11.884
Well, have you ever
used one of those before?

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.149
- Bert, seriously, shut up!
- Did you see a manual in there?

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:15.361
Oh, my God.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:17.086
Listen, if that backfires,
it could be very dangerous!

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:19.389
Hurry up with that!

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.451
You killed my brother.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:17.282
Yeah, she killed both brothers,
you dickweed. Ha-ha!

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:21.392
I'm gonna have to soak my
finger in vinegar for a week.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:23.722
Now burn in hell
and shame the devil,

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:27.161
you kraut-berry-gib-lookin'
motherfucker.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:34.773
That was awesome.

01:25:34.997 --> 01:25:36.067
All right, come on, Bert.
Let's go.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.279
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I mean, he's dead!

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:40.571
Why are we hurrying now?

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:42.907
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.446
Come on.

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:46.553
You're all right.
Come on, buddy. You can do it.

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:48.152
Okay. All right.

01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:50.651
Oh. Oh, Jesus.

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:54.450
Oh, God.
That's just fuckin' ghastly.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.622
This is the scene of the crime.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:25:59.161
Oh, fuck.

01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:00.923
This is where
Laundrette said no.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.357
It's all right, Bert.
There are other fishes in the sea.

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.629
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:08.034
Well, like,
what are you up to, Kerry?

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:10.799
- Not me, Bert. Not me.
- Well, you said that really fast!

01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:14.845
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come on! Got it!

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.175
Look at you. You're so athletic.

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:20.886
Right. All right, Bert, come on.

01:26:21.143 --> 01:26:22.816
It's you and me, pal.
Come on, Bert.

01:26:23.045 --> 01:26:24.683
You can do it. Come on.

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:27.290
- Ow! God.
- Come on.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:28.995
- Okay.
- It's <i>so</i> small!

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.823
Oh, you're small too.
More like the bonsai than an oak

01:26:32.054 --> 01:26:33.965
when you really get
down to it. Okay.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:38.535
Oh! Oh, it's wonderful!
Oh, I'm flying!

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:41.070
You're not flying, Bert!
Stay focused!

01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:45.712
Laundrette!
My beautiful Laundrette, you came!

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.127
Who are you talking to, Bert?

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.682
A woman hung me upside down
and hit me with a frying pan.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:53.751
Get down here so
I can sit on your head bush!

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:57.183
- Baby?
- Fly to me, Bert!

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:59.824
Here I come, my love!

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.324
Brace yourself for
the landing, Bert!

01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:07.026
Bert! Bert, are you okay...

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:12.161
Oh, God!

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:16.001
Oh, my God! Oh, fuck!

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:20.611
Oh, my God! I can't...

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:27.414
Kerry?
These chairs are not cool!

01:27:27.676 --> 01:27:30.179
Oh! Jesus Christ.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.023
Kerry!

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:39.429
Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, fuck!

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:42.692
That's for Stef! Oh, fuck!

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.878
Wait! I'm coming too!

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.810
Bert, I'm gonna take your Vespa.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:10.119
Hal I beat you! I won!

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.125
Wait! Wait! Come back!

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:19.065
I have something really
cool to tell you! Seriously!

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:26.973
Ah! Ha-ha-ha!
We reap what we sow!

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:32.747
We got her, bro. We got her.

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:35.922
Oh, dear God! What have we done?

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:39.819
We're supposed to save lives,
not... not...

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:43.358
Holy shit.

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:44.961
Kerry Derzius?

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:47.497
Delroy, bring all the
stuff we need, man!

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:51.863
- I know this chick!
- Jesus!

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:55.668
What, you... you know my name?

01:28:55.931 --> 01:28:59.845
You bet your ass I do. It's me.
It's me, Marty Clement.

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.513
Uh, we went through
training together.

01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:04.307
Am I gonna die?

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:06.519
'Cause that would
be really ironic.

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:08.516
All right, listen.

01:29:08.777 --> 01:29:10.217
I want you to sit
tight for me, okay?

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.621
You sit tight right here.
I'll be right back.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.987
And then I'm gonna be with
you for the rest of time.

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:16.578
Hey, man!
What are you waitin' for?

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.221
I have a real shot over there!
You're gonna blow it for me!

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.966
Marty! Marty!
It never go down, sir.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:24.136
You no see me.
I smoke from 1:00 in the mornin'.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.498
Man, are you... are you
telling me you're still high?

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:28.730
Look upon my eyes, my brethren.

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:31.477
Sweet Christ. Put those back on!

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.061
All right, listen.
Here's the deal.

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:34.509
I'll say I was driving, all right?
That's the plan.

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.216
- I was behind the wheel.
- Yo, sir. One.

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:38.815
- Uh, what?
- Me owe you one.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.320
You're goddamn
right you do, man!

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:41.862
Just, um, help me
get her on the thing!

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:43.421
Yeah, man.

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:48.083
All right, Kerry.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:50.227
- Wait. No. He's gone.
- Shh. Shh.

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:51.555
- He's... No, he's still in the...
- Kerry. Shh.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.700
You have to save your breath.
No, no, he's g-

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.224
- No, focus on your breathing.
- He's alive. He's alive.

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:56.851
- You know this drill.
- He's not...

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.219
- You pick a focal point.
- Please.

01:29:58.426 --> 01:29:59.586
- Look at my mouth.
- Don't...

01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:01.436
At my mouth. Fuckin' mouth!

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:05.166
We're gonna lift on three.
One, two... Oh!

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.674
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:08.176
All right! We're moving!

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:09.848
- Sorry, man!
- We're moving!

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.551
Oh, my God! Oh, God.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:18.190
<i>Deck the halls
with boughs of holly.</i>

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:23.225
<i>Sowing the seeds oi love...</i>

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:26.091
I know,
I know, but you're my brother.

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.197
You have to say that.

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.808
Oh, this is absurd.
My palms are sweaty.

01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:43.413
What, am I like 13?

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.982
Shoot me that ﬂyboy smile again.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:55.390
Thanks, bro.
I'd be so lost without you.

01:30:56.785 --> 01:31:00.096
Okay, wish me luck.

01:31:24.112 --> 01:31:26.251
Indubitably.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:31.658
In-du-bi-tab... lndu...

01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:38.332
Would you like a bag for that?

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:43.141
I think we both know the
answer to that question...

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.369
Bethany Lynne Goolsby.

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:55.143
Anson! You came back!

01:31:55.377 --> 01:31:58.358
But what happened to your
face and arm and things?

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:02.220
I have thought long
and hard about this.

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:08.531
And I feel that it is a story
best suited... for another time.

01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:13.071
I can and will tell you
that I now have to poop

01:32:13.328 --> 01:32:18.004
into a colostomy bag...
possibly forever.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.337
I hope this is
not a deal breaker.

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:24.550
Don't be ridiculous.

01:32:26.975 --> 01:32:28.750
This is for you.

01:32:33.982 --> 01:32:35.154
I love it!

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:38.364
Well, the ball is officially
in your court now,

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:40.725
Bethany Lynne Goolsby.

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:45.067
Is it gonna be one spoon,
or two?

01:32:54.836 --> 01:32:56.747
Fa, lah, lah-lah-lah,

01:32:57.005 --> 01:33:00.680
<i>Lah-lah-lah, lah-lah-lah.</i>

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.588

01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:39.424
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly.</i>

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:49.559
<i>Don we now our gay apparel.</i>

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:59.601
<i>Troll the ancient Yule tide carol.</i>

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:14.325
<i>Sing we joyous, a}! Together.</i>

01:34:17.919 --> 01:34:22.800
<i>Heedless of the wind

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:27.473
<i>Fah-lah-lah, lah-lah-lah-lah.</i>

01:34:36.304 --> 01:34:39.979
<i>Fah-lah-lah-lah-lah.</i>

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:50.793

Lah-lah-lah, lah-lah-lah...

01:35:25.153 --> 01:35:28.225
<i>Try to bite my tongue.</i>

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:31.197
<i>Try to hold my breath.</i>

01:35:31.426 --> 01:35:36.068
<i>Try to keep everything
to myself.</i>

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.904
<i>Wei}, you shot
a big poison arrow.</i>

01:35:41.169 --> 01:35:43.911
<i>And it scares me to death.</i>

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:49.087
<i>But I can't think
of nobody else.</i>

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:55.718
<i>I've been dying to tell you.</i>

01:35:56.751 --> 01:36:00.528
<i>How you turn my head around.</i>

01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:09.603
<i>Breathless.</i>

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:12.777
<i>Fighting for air.</i>

01:36:13.034 --> 01:36:18.143
<i>Faking to my knees.</i>

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:21.881
<i>But I can't speak.</i>

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:27.423
<i>Baby, you're leaving me.</i>

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:33.425
<i>Breathless</i>

01:36:38.226 --> 01:36:40.968

<i>The food of love.</i>

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:46.141
<i>We'll play on and on.</i>

01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:49.075
<i>And on and on and on.</i>

01:36:49.304 --> 01:36:50.749
<i>And on.</i>

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:53.782
Some people say.

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:56.921
<i>That love's a feast.</i>

01:36:57.145 --> 01:37:02.117
<i>You only know it's good
when it's gone.</i>

01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:03.988
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:37:04.252 --> 01:37:08.667
<i>I've been dying to tell you.</i>
