WEBVTT

00:04.197 --> 00:07.128
Did you fart?
KEVIN: Yeah.

00:07.368 --> 00:09.769
(chuckling): Yeah.
You can't do that in here.

00:09.771 --> 00:11.514
It's the men's room.
Come on, man.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.013
What country are you from?
I'm from America where you

00:14.015 --> 00:16.482
can fart almost anywhere you
want.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.585
You, sir, are an animal.
I'm not an animal!

00:18.705 --> 00:21.248
I'm a human being.
Humans fart!

00:21.428 --> 00:25.196
Okay, we fart!
Oh, no.

00:25.316 --> 00:30.006

00:30.378 --> 00:33.645
If you can't fart in the
bathroom, then where can you fart?

00:33.765 --> 00:35.965
I was just giving out little
bubbles, little...

00:35.967 --> 00:36.887
PETE: You know, just 'cause

00:37.005 --> 00:39.005
you give it a cute little name
doesn't make you any less than

00:39.007 --> 00:41.374
of a shit bag, okay?
Well, I have been

00:41.376 --> 00:43.610
extraordinarily gassy recently.
We know.

00:43.612 --> 00:44.607
God, this is like a rancid
batch.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.708
I think I still have Ted's AIDS
cocktail floating around down

00:46.710 --> 00:48.910
there.
I don't how those guys put up

00:48.912 --> 00:51.046
with that stuff.
Well, Kevin, the alternative

00:51.048 --> 00:52.014
is the end of <i>Philadelphia,</i>
<i>so...</i>

00:52.137 --> 00:54.103
<i>Hmm, good point.</i>
<i>TACO: Spoiler alert.</i>

00:54.105 --> 00:56.072
<i>I only saw the first half.</i>
<i>I feel like I'm at a</i>

00:56.074 --> 00:57.940
<i>MacArthur family reunion.</i>
<i>I mean, I realize Ruxin is out</i>

00:57.942 --> 00:59.742
<i>of town on business, but where</i>
<i>the hell is Andre?</i>

00:59.744 --> 01:02.164
<i>Have you seen him?</i>
<i>Yeah. He's not doing good.</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:04.296
<i>Went to his place to shower, and</i>
<i>he didn't even get off the couch</i>

01:04.298 --> 01:06.265
<i>to cook me breakfast.</i>
<i>Do you guys think he blames</i>

01:06.267 --> 01:08.924
<i>us a little bit for the whole</i>
<i>Trixie situation?</i>

01:09.044 --> 01:11.211
<i>Why, because of the bachelor</i>
<i>draft thing?</i>

01:11.213 --> 01:13.046
<i>Can you imagine how you would</i>
<i>feel if that whole thing just</i>

01:13.048 --> 01:15.315
blew up in your face?
I think you mean <i>her</i> face.

01:15.317 --> 01:17.417
(laughter, Kevin groans)
Okay, this is what I'm

01:17.419 --> 01:19.419
talking about, okay?
The NFL has a whole bunch of new

01:19.421 --> 01:21.655
rules for safety this season,
right?

01:21.657 --> 01:23.757
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we need to institute a

01:23.759 --> 01:25.725
few of our own, like no
headhunting, no attacking a

01:25.727 --> 01:27.894
defenseless receiver.
I an, if there was ever a

01:27.896 --> 01:30.063
defenseless receiver, it's
Andre.

01:30.065 --> 01:32.165
That's not how we were taught
to play the game.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.000
We were taught, when someone
says something stupid, bam, you

01:34.002 --> 01:36.169
say something back.
All right, you just take it

01:36.171 --> 01:38.171
easy, James Harrison.
This is our best friend we're

01:38.173 --> 01:40.407
talking about.
Fine, I'll do the best I can,

01:40.409 --> 01:42.275
but on game day, when he comes
walking in in some stupid outfit

01:42.277 --> 01:44.511
that an Ecuadorean gay man would
dress his dog up in, then I

01:44.513 --> 01:46.913
don't know what I'm gonna do.
Mm.

01:46.915 --> 01:49.349
JENNY: Oh, Christopher is
gonna love this school.

01:49.351 --> 01:51.718
This play yard's amazing.
Although this playground

01:51.720 --> 01:54.120
looks a little pornographic to
me.

01:54.122 --> 01:56.523
What?! It's not.
Yeah, look, babe.

01:56.525 --> 01:58.525
That tube's like a... like a
shaft, and those spheres...

01:58.527 --> 02:00.527
Look at-- that girl's playing
with the balls.

02:00.529 --> 02:02.529
Stop. Stop doing that.
Look, the-the tube is heading

02:02.531 --> 02:04.531
right towards the pink curtain.
No. Stop.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.533
Which is obviously the labia
minora.

02:06.535 --> 02:08.935
Stop it.
Labia majora.

02:08.937 --> 02:11.137
Oh, God.
I don't know which one.

02:11.139 --> 02:13.373
The labia.
Oh, my God, just stop saying

02:13.375 --> 02:15.442
"labia."
But I'm just saying, you

02:15.444 --> 02:17.377
could be, like, "Oh, hey, Timmy,
show me on the playground where

02:17.379 --> 02:19.713
the man touched you on the
playground."

02:19.715 --> 02:21.481
Oh. Oh, my... Oh, my God!
Is that who I think it is?

02:21.483 --> 02:23.650
That is Jay and Kristin
Cutler... and the Cutlet.

02:23.652 --> 02:25.852
Our kid's gonna go to school
with the Cutlet! Yes!

02:25.854 --> 02:27.821
Our kid is going to go to
school with the Cutlet!

02:27.823 --> 02:29.623
See? I told you, babe.
You go out to dinner, you get

02:29.625 --> 02:31.725
drunk, you go home, you have
sloppy unprotected sex, and

02:31.727 --> 02:33.927
look.
You become best friends with the

02:33.929 --> 02:38.431
Cutlers.
It all works out. I told you!

02:38.433 --> 02:41.501
Ooh.
Whoa!

02:41.503 --> 02:45.238
Not good.
Oh, my gosh.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.108
He has yet to touch his copy of
<i>Mister</i> magazine.

02:48.110 --> 02:51.144
Can you smell that?
Not even a hint of CK One in the

02:51.146 --> 02:52.479
air.

02:52.481 --> 02:54.848
Jesus.
Hi, Andre.

02:54.850 --> 02:58.451
So, this is the man cave, huh?
ANDRE: No.

02:58.453 --> 03:01.288
It's supposed to be the <i>magic</i>
<i>man cave.</i>

03:01.290 --> 03:03.657
<i>A place for all the dudes to</i>
<i>come once I was married.</i>

03:03.659 --> 03:06.092
<i>Defenseless receiver.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

03:06.094 --> 03:08.461
<i>Defenseless receiver.</i>
<i>But now I'm not married,</i>

03:08.463 --> 03:10.664
<i>and no dudes want to come in</i>
<i>my man cave.</i>

03:10.666 --> 03:13.099
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>Andre?</i>

03:13.101 --> 03:15.468
<i>I'm just alone.</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

03:15.470 --> 03:17.871
<i>I know I wasn't your best man in</i>
<i>marriage.</i>

03:17.873 --> 03:20.473
<i>(whispering): God help me.</i>
<i>But I am prepared to be your</i>

03:20.475 --> 03:24.277
<i>best man in bachelorhood, and...</i>
<i>What?</i>

03:24.279 --> 03:26.680
<i>I will make you forget all</i>
<i>about...</i>

03:26.682 --> 03:29.115
<i>Trixie.</i>
<i>How'd you learn that?</i>

03:29.117 --> 03:31.484
<i>I've been practicing that for</i>
<i>three weeks.</i>

03:31.486 --> 03:33.887
<i>I couldn't get it.</i>
<i>Andre, it took, like, two</i>

03:33.889 --> 03:36.289
<i>minutes to learn.</i>
<i>No wonder why she left.</i>

03:36.291 --> 03:38.692
<i>It's not because I made her</i>
<i>blind.</i>

03:38.694 --> 03:40.994
<i>It's because I'm a terrible</i>
<i>magician.</i>

03:40.996 --> 03:43.196
<i>There are other reasons, too.</i>
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

03:43.198 --> 03:45.065
<i>Man cave was supposed to be</i>
<i>full of magic, but now it's just</i>

03:45.067 --> 03:47.067
<i>a dark, smelly hole.</i>
<i>(Taco and Pete sniff)</i>

03:47.069 --> 03:49.302
<i>Nights were gonna be filled with</i>
<i>ball juggling.</i>

03:49.304 --> 03:51.504
<i>I even had a night for black</i>
<i>magic.</i>

03:51.506 --> 03:53.506
<i>I wanted to learn the ancient</i>
<i>art of sword swallowing.</i>

03:53.508 --> 03:55.508
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Enough, enough. Bye, Andre.</i>

03:55.510 --> 03:57.510
<i>All in my man cave.</i>
<i>Bye, Andre. Sorry.</i>

03:57.512 --> 03:59.713
<i>No one's coming in my man</i>
<i>cave anymore.</i>

03:59.715 --> 04:01.715
<i>Everyone's just pulling out.</i>
<i>How great is this place,</i>

04:01.717 --> 04:03.917
<i>guys?</i>
<i>I know, it's really nice.</i>

04:03.919 --> 04:06.152
<i>Beautiful, absolutely.</i>
<i>I love it.</i>

04:06.154 --> 04:08.154
<i>Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, my...</i>
<i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

04:08.156 --> 04:10.156
<i>So sorry.</i>
<i>I-I apologize.</i>

04:10.158 --> 04:12.158
<i>Okay, see you guys.</i>
<i>Good to see you.</i>

04:12.160 --> 04:14.060
<i>It's okay. Okay, bye.</i>
<i>Good to see you there.</i>

04:14.062 --> 04:16.161
<i>Wow. You look so much like</i>
<i>Jay Cutler.</i>

04:16.164 --> 04:18.064
<i>I get that all the time.</i>
<i>I don't see it, though, really.</i>

04:18.065 --> 04:20.166
<i>Weren't we in a baby class</i>
<i>together?</i>

04:20.168 --> 04:22.502
<i>Oh, wow.</i>
<i>I don't know. I don't. Maybe.</i>

04:22.504 --> 04:24.437
<i>I haven't been back.</i>
<i>Do you know that somebody</i>

04:24.439 --> 04:26.539
<i>actually stole a bottle of my</i>
<i>breast milk?</i>

04:26.541 --> 04:28.942
<i>Unbelievable.</i>
<i>No way!</i>

04:28.944 --> 04:30.944
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>KEVIN AND JENNY: No!</i>

04:30.946 --> 04:32.846
<i>Oh, it's probably that</i>
<i>Russian mob.</i>

04:32.848 --> 04:34.848
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>Whoa! Jesu...</i>

04:34.850 --> 04:36.750
<i>Good God!</i>
<i>Holy cow!</i>

04:36.752 --> 04:38.752
<i>Kid's got a cannon.</i>
<i>Probably gets that from his</i>

04:38.754 --> 04:40.854
<i>mother.</i>
<i>Is it just me, or does this</i>

04:40.856 --> 04:42.789
<i>playground look like a sex act?</i>
<i>You know, I was thinking the</i>

04:42.791 --> 04:45.024
<i>same thing.</i>
<i>I'm, like, "This kid looks like</i>

04:45.026 --> 04:46.893
<i>he's about to be ejaculated</i>
<i>right out of that thing.</i>

04:46.895 --> 04:48.762
<i>He's about to be a money shot."</i>
<i>I mean, who puts a pink</i>

04:48.764 --> 04:51.197
<i>curtain on a slide?</i>
<i>I know.</i>

04:51.199 --> 04:53.032
<i>Jungle gym is about to plow</i>
<i>that piece over there.</i>

04:53.034 --> 04:55.135
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>This kid just keeps rubbing</i>

04:55.137 --> 04:57.103
<i>these balls like they're gonna</i>
<i>do something, you know?</i>

04:57.105 --> 04:59.305
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Hey, it's great meeting you,</i>

04:59.307 --> 05:01.574
<i>Kev.</i>
<i>It's good to know there's some</i>

05:01.576 --> 05:03.610
<i>cool parents here.</i>
<i>Kev?</i>

05:03.612 --> 05:06.613
<i>This is amazing!</i>
<i>The MacArthur-Cutler road trip.</i>

05:06.615 --> 05:08.815
<i>No, no, the MacCutler</i>
<i>road trip.</i>

05:08.817 --> 05:11.050
<i>I like that.</i>
<i>Every year, Kev.</i>

05:11.052 --> 05:13.052
<i>Ah, let's get T-shirts made</i>
<i>up.</i>

05:13.054 --> 05:14.954
<i>Jenny, of course.</i>
<i>We would be honored to be</i>

05:14.956 --> 05:16.756
<i>Chalupa Batman's godparents.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

05:16.758 --> 05:18.591
<i>Hey, Jay, what do you say</i>
<i>tonight we pull the old wife</i>

05:18.593 --> 05:20.593
<i>switcheroo?</i>
<i>I yell "Yahtzee," and we all</i>

05:20.595 --> 05:22.996
<i>switch rooms?</i>
<i>Why not?</i>

05:22.998 --> 05:25.432
<i>Awesome!</i>
<i>Hey, I'm sorry you got to take</i>

05:25.434 --> 05:27.801
<i>one for the team.</i>
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

05:27.803 --> 05:30.170
<i>Oh, oh, I get it. It's okay.</i>
<i>Cool, cool.</i>

05:30.172 --> 05:32.605
<i>So, uh, I'm sure I'll be seeing</i>
<i>you guys around.</i>

05:32.607 --> 05:34.974
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>That would be great.</i>

05:34.976 --> 05:37.410
<i>Later, guys.</i>
<i>You, too. So good...</i>

05:37.412 --> 05:39.779
<i>Bye, guys.</i>
<i>See you guys later.</i>

05:39.781 --> 05:42.182
<i>Bye.</i>
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

05:42.184 --> 05:44.617
<i>They called me Kev!</i>
<i>They called me Kev!</i>

05:44.619 --> 05:46.920
<i>They said we were cool.</i>
<i>I knew these things would</i>

05:46.922 --> 05:49.255
<i>start to pay off.</i>

05:52.350 --> 05:55.900
That's right, I'm gonna be
best friends with Jay Cutler.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.340
Really?
Yeah. I can't wait to leave

05:58.342 --> 06:00.476
you shit sippers in the dust.
Well, I'm glad you're having

06:00.478 --> 06:02.344
a great time, 'cause there is
one among us, namely Andre, who

06:02.346 --> 06:04.513
is doing much worse than we
thought.

06:04.515 --> 06:06.715
Ah.
We're gonna have to do

06:06.717 --> 06:07.243
something to goose that poor
bastard's spirits.

06:07.483 --> 06:09.483
Well, I will not go back to
that spa with him.

06:09.485 --> 06:11.719
I won't do it.
No, we-we may have to let him

06:11.721 --> 06:14.121
win.
The season?

06:14.123 --> 06:16.090
No! Geez, what's wrong with
you? I'm talking one game.

06:16.092 --> 06:18.092
It's week one.
It doesn't really matter

06:18.094 --> 06:20.294
long-term.
Okay, who's he playing?

06:20.296 --> 06:22.663
You know.
Oh.

06:22.665 --> 06:24.898
Yeah.
Okay, you good with that

06:24.900 --> 06:25.858
Taco?
You good with letting him win?

06:25.960 --> 06:27.960
Yeah. I'm cool with it.
It's not up to me, though.

06:27.962 --> 06:30.329
It is totally up to you.
It's your team.

06:30.331 --> 06:32.464
Yeah.
I gave the control of my team

06:32.466 --> 06:34.600
to this guy who hangs out at the
library.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.802
He's a war vet.
He has something called, uh,

06:36.804 --> 06:39.204
PSTD?
You mean PTSD.

06:39.206 --> 06:41.206
No PSTD-- plenty of STDs.
Taco, why aren't you running

06:41.208 --> 06:43.442
your team?
I'm supporting the troops.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.979
And who has time for this
bullshit anyway?

06:46.981 --> 06:50.449
Should be around here.
He likes to sleep in the

06:50.451 --> 06:52.451
reference section.
Sure, why not?

06:52.453 --> 06:55.320
(sniffing)
Yeah, he's here. All right.

06:55.322 --> 06:58.690
(snoring)
Okay. There he is.

06:58.692 --> 07:00.792
Waking him up's a bit of a
process.

07:00.794 --> 07:03.629
(whispering): Penico.
Penico.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.397
I'll take you to Hell with
me, hajji!

07:05.399 --> 07:07.399
Jesus Christ.
Holster your weapon!

07:07.401 --> 07:10.068
Holster your weapon now!
Oh, Christ, sorry. Taco.

07:10.070 --> 07:12.070
Hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?

07:12.072 --> 07:14.072
I need my fantasy football
team back.

07:14.074 --> 07:16.074
Oh, so you made your first
billion-- congrats.

07:16.076 --> 07:18.410
Mm, not exactly.
The PBIB's still losing a lot of

07:18.412 --> 07:20.646
market share-- people just
shaking it off.

07:20.648 --> 07:25.851
So as per your orders, the
team is still under my command.

07:25.853 --> 07:27.853
I'm so glad you guys came over.

07:27.855 --> 07:29.688
I know. Me, too.
Thanks for having us.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.690
Of course. I'm sorry the
place is such a wreck.

07:31.692 --> 07:33.692
Our house is ten times worse.
We're just finishing up

07:33.694 --> 07:35.694
construction.
You are?

07:35.696 --> 07:38.397
It's been a real hassle,
especially during the season.

07:38.399 --> 07:41.033
Jay literally cannot focus on
anything but football.

07:41.035 --> 07:43.702
Tell me about it.
When Kevin is in the middle of

07:43.704 --> 07:46.772
football season, he's just...
gone.

07:46.774 --> 07:49.841
Jay has laser focus.
I mean, he pushes his body to

07:49.843 --> 07:52.077
the limit.
Kevin, too.

07:52.079 --> 07:55.180
When he is setting his lineup,
he will lock himself away in the

07:55.182 --> 07:58.283
bathroom for hours.
Laser focused.

07:58.285 --> 08:01.553
Yeah. Yep.
Surprise!

08:01.555 --> 08:04.423
Hey!
Hey.

08:04.425 --> 08:06.892
Where is Jay?
Jay's at work.

08:06.894 --> 08:09.695
Oh.
How's it going, boys?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.530
It's going great.
I'm glad.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.532
You think Jay's gonna come to
the next playdate?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.367
Probably not...
Oh.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.369
...would be my guess.
Hey, can you watch them for just

08:17.371 --> 08:19.371
a second?
I'm gonna go grab some milk.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.206
Yep.
Excuse me.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.041
Okay.
Kevin.

08:23.043 --> 08:25.043
What?
Don't ruin this.

08:25.045 --> 08:27.246
I'm not ruining it.
You're probably ruining it.

08:27.248 --> 08:29.248
What are you... telling her
stories about your college years

08:29.250 --> 08:31.083
again?
No.

08:31.085 --> 08:33.952
"Oh, I got drunk and I pumped
gas naked one time."

08:33.953 --> 08:37.589
That was you!
(laughing): That was awesome.

08:37.591 --> 08:39.591
Oh, my God. Just...
It was like yesterday.

08:39.592 --> 08:42.995
...go. Go before you...
So wasted.

08:42.996 --> 08:45.230
Did you...
I got bubbles.

08:45.232 --> 08:47.466
Oh, my God, I can taste it.
Jenny, the kitchen is gr...

08:47.468 --> 08:51.737
Oh, my God.
Oh.

08:51.739 --> 08:57.075
You guys don't smell anything?
Nothing?

08:57.077 --> 08:59.144
Maybe one of the boys has a
poopy diaper.

08:59.146 --> 09:01.313
Mm-hmm.
Here, bud.

09:01.315 --> 09:03.515
Here's your milk.
Here, you hold it.

09:03.517 --> 09:05.884
Ooh, there you go.

09:05.886 --> 09:13.125
(screaming)
Whoa-ho! What a hit!

09:13.127 --> 09:14.860
Oh, my God, oh...
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:14.862 --> 09:16.528
Nice hit!
Are you okay?

09:16.530 --> 09:18.196
Whoa, he took the milk.
Is he all right?

09:18.198 --> 09:20.365
That's breast milk, that's
kind of weird.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.601
Uh, I don't know what...
Yeah.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.803
...just happened.
Um, I'm so sorry he sacked your

09:24.805 --> 09:27.105
son.
Yeah.

09:27.107 --> 09:29.174
That wasn't a sack.
Well, it was a sack and a

09:29.176 --> 09:31.176
strip.
No one sacks a Cutler.

09:31.178 --> 09:33.011
Have you seen your offensive
line?

09:33.013 --> 09:34.846
I think everybody sacked a
Cutler.

09:34.848 --> 09:37.449
Kevin?
Well, my little guy's getting

09:37.451 --> 09:43.188
tired, so we should go.
No, you don't have to go.

09:43.190 --> 09:46.391
Nope, no poopy diaper.
But you should check your slacks

09:46.393 --> 09:49.895
maybe.
Bye.

09:49.897 --> 09:54.032
(door opens, closes)
That went well.

09:54.034 --> 09:57.002
It did not go well.
In fact, Seabiscuit decided to

09:57.004 --> 09:59.404
put on a little bubble show for
the Cutlet.

09:59.406 --> 10:01.907
I was so close to hanging out
with cool people finally.

10:01.909 --> 10:04.242
I hear you, bro.
After being out there, it's hard

10:04.244 --> 10:06.812
to come back in here and listen
to all this mishegoss.

10:06.814 --> 10:10.082
We are not out of this.
The Cutlers are huge on charity.

10:10.084 --> 10:12.584
They're hosting that charity
event for the school at their

10:12.586 --> 10:15.387
house.
We are gonna charity the shit

10:15.389 --> 10:17.489
out of them, you guys.
They are going to love us for

10:17.491 --> 10:19.491
it.
Well, while you guys are

10:19.493 --> 10:22.260
desperately trying to become the
couple that the Cutlers hate the

10:22.262 --> 10:24.396
least, I'd like you to see what
the newest member of our league

10:24.398 --> 10:26.398
is up to.
Not only will he not throw the

10:26.400 --> 10:28.900
game or give up control of
Taco's team, but now he's

10:28.902 --> 10:33.004
posting.
This is Taco and I will be

10:33.006 --> 10:35.574
victorious on the battlefield.
Hey, Taco.

10:35.576 --> 10:38.677
Hey, Andre, I have one
question for you.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.712
Did you ever have to tell a
friend that his dick was blown

10:40.714 --> 10:43.849
off and then you realize it
wasn't your friend, it was you?

10:43.851 --> 10:47.552
You don't know what it means to
lose.

10:47.554 --> 10:49.554
But you will.
I think this will really

10:49.556 --> 10:51.556
cheer up Andre.
I don't think it will cheer

10:51.558 --> 10:53.392
him up at all.
I think it'll do the opposite

10:53.394 --> 10:55.394
actually.
Hey, you know what?

10:55.396 --> 10:57.696
Since the season hasn't started
yet, what do you say we make it

10:57.698 --> 11:02.934
a ten-team league?
I got just the guys.

11:02.936 --> 11:04.936
Oh, it's Will and Ron.
Ten teams!

11:04.938 --> 11:06.772
They're really violent.
Ten teams!

11:06.774 --> 11:08.774
Ten teams!
Yeah, ten teams!

11:08.776 --> 11:10.609
Ten teams, Andre!
Ten teams.

11:10.611 --> 11:12.611
You... (shushes)
What do you mean... (shushes)?

11:12.613 --> 11:15.080
I lost my dick for your freedom!
Have fun on the Fourth of July

11:15.082 --> 11:17.082
while I'm sitting there peeing
like a girl!

11:17.084 --> 11:18.917
I got no dick!
Okay.

11:18.919 --> 11:20.752
And that is the newest member
of our league.

11:20.754 --> 11:22.587
All right, don't worry about
it.

11:22.589 --> 11:24.589
The commissioner will take care
of this.

11:24.591 --> 11:26.591
You should bring a gun.
You turned it into a bong,

11:26.593 --> 11:29.928
Taco.
I did.

11:29.930 --> 11:35.467
Sergeant Penico?
Oh, wasn't there, didn't do

11:35.469 --> 11:37.302
it, wasn't me.
My name's Kevin MacArthur.

11:37.304 --> 11:39.104
I'm-I'm a... Remember the
league?

11:39.106 --> 11:41.139
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the
commissioner.

11:41.141 --> 11:43.141
I have a proposition for you.
What do you got?

11:43.143 --> 11:45.010
How would you like to meet
Jay Cutler?

11:45.012 --> 11:46.678
Jay Cutler?
Yeah.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.747
I'd love to meet... I mean...
(stammers)... In person?

11:48.749 --> 11:50.582
In person, yeah.
Do you think he'd sign

11:50.584 --> 11:53.452
something for me?
I mean we can ask, we can...

11:53.454 --> 11:56.588
Brought it back from Fallujah.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.890
We'll certainly ask.

12:05.228 --> 12:09.151
Yes, ladies for Andre.
Can I get two vodka tonics, please?

12:09.391 --> 12:11.391
You stay here and just soak this in.

12:11.393 --> 12:13.393
You are single, get used to this.

12:13.395 --> 12:15.395
I don't want to be single, I

12:15.397 --> 12:17.497
want to be with Trixie.
You're looking at this

12:17.499 --> 12:19.633
completely wrong.
Do you remember in the old days

12:19.635 --> 12:21.868
we would watch football and
there was one game on?

12:21.870 --> 12:23.703
Yeah.
Even if it was shitty, even

12:23.705 --> 12:25.705
if it was boring, even if it was
a blowout, you had to commit to

12:25.707 --> 12:27.707
that.
Now we got the RedZone channel,

12:27.709 --> 12:30.176
right?
Being single is the RedZone

12:30.178 --> 12:32.412
channel, okay?
You can watch any game you want.

12:32.414 --> 12:34.414
You can watch two at a time if
you want.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.416
The one with the big butt over
here? Great.

12:36.418 --> 12:38.418
Big boob game, channel 27?
Going over here.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.487
I mean, look at Taco.
This guy, his dick's just

12:40.489 --> 12:42.489
flipping around the channels
willy-nilly.

12:42.491 --> 12:44.524
Did your parents get divorced
when you were young?

12:44.526 --> 12:46.526
Oh, my God, how did you kw
that?

12:46.528 --> 12:49.095
This could be your life.
Yeah... I mean, yeah...

12:49.097 --> 12:51.531
Yeah, yeah, you're seeing it.
You know, it's all good good.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.567
Yeah, well, you know, I don't
think you're using that right,

12:53.569 --> 12:55.402
but yeah.
Okay.

12:55.404 --> 12:57.237
Hey, boys.
You guys see how many Jettas are

12:57.239 --> 12:59.573
parked out back?
Aren't you glad Trixie's dead?

12:59.575 --> 13:01.741
She's not dead, she's blind.
Is it all right if I invited

13:01.743 --> 13:03.743
an Eskimo brother who was in
town?

13:03.745 --> 13:05.745
Yeah, as long as it's not
Sergeant Penico.

13:05.747 --> 13:07.747
No, they don't let crazy
homeless people in this bar.

13:07.749 --> 13:09.583
All right, put this in your
body right now.

13:09.585 --> 13:11.418
Yes.
Oh, vodka?

13:11.420 --> 13:13.420
No, I want a Riesling.
Don't say that, okay?

13:13.422 --> 13:15.255
No, don't.
You just lost 50% of the

13:15.257 --> 13:17.257
dating pool.
Lips to the glass.

13:17.259 --> 13:19.192
Now, stop breathing and drink.
There it is.

13:19.194 --> 13:21.294
Bartender, can I get a
Vaportini, please?

13:21.296 --> 13:23.296
What's that?
It's a way to inhale your

13:23.298 --> 13:25.799
drink.
Light a little flame.

13:25.801 --> 13:28.768
Set the booze on fire.
It vaporizes.

13:28.770 --> 13:30.937
Then it goes straight into your
bloodstream.

13:30.939 --> 13:36.610
Check it out.
(coughing)

13:36.612 --> 13:39.946
No, Officer, I have not been
drinking tonight.

13:39.948 --> 13:41.781
I'm gonna smoke a martini
with you.

13:41.783 --> 13:43.450
Yeah!
Let's do this.

13:43.452 --> 13:45.151
Can we maybe smoke a pisco
sour?

13:45.153 --> 13:47.787
Say, man.
You can smoke whatever you like.

13:47.789 --> 13:50.824
But me personally, I prefer that
good good.

13:50.826 --> 13:52.826
What's up, Snoop?
We're over here.

13:52.828 --> 13:55.629
Snoop is your Eskimo brother?
How do you guys know Snoop?

13:55.631 --> 13:58.298
What's up?
Yeah.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.300
What happened?
Snoop, this is my Eskimo

14:00.302 --> 14:02.102
brother, Pete.
Hey, Pete, how you doing,

14:02.104 --> 14:03.603
brother?
Does that mean that

14:03.605 --> 14:05.071
we're, like...?
Eskimo brothers-in-law.

14:05.073 --> 14:06.773
Family.
And this is the guy I was

14:06.775 --> 14:08.742
talking to you about-- Andre.
Yeah, but you can call me Dre

14:08.744 --> 14:12.445
Dogg.
You know, I gotta say this,

14:12.447 --> 14:14.981
tonight was totally lame,
but now it's all good good.

14:14.983 --> 14:17.117
That's not the right way
to use it.

14:17.119 --> 14:19.119
What do you think about
this outfit, Snoop?

14:19.121 --> 14:21.321
You think this is good good?
On the real?

14:21.323 --> 14:23.990
It's not even one good.
Oh.

14:23.992 --> 14:26.292
It's horrible.
It's a train wreck. Bad bad.

14:26.294 --> 14:28.128
All right, boys,
let's light 'em up.

14:28.130 --> 14:29.996
That's what I'm here for.
All right.

14:29.998 --> 14:34.501
♪ 
ALL: Smoke your drink!

14:34.503 --> 14:38.338
Good good!
Stop it, Dre!

14:38.340 --> 14:42.976
Ooh-ee, that's the do-it fluid!
Eskimo brother. Whoo!

14:42.978 --> 14:45.145
Ice fishing in the
same hole, baby.

14:45.147 --> 14:47.981
Yeah. I never asked you
this, Snoop: what do you do?

14:47.983 --> 14:51.851
Mm... Yeah!
Bro time.

14:51.853 --> 14:56.623
Bro time!
Oh, boy!

14:56.625 --> 14:59.926
Gentlemen, these ladies
would like to smoke some drinks.

14:59.928 --> 15:06.733
(Taco coughs)
You're getting me wasted.

15:06.735 --> 15:08.234
Getting myself wasted.
You're just here.

15:08.236 --> 15:10.070
Living in the red zone
is amazing.

15:10.072 --> 15:12.972
I can go to you, I can go
to you, I can go to you.

15:12.974 --> 15:14.574
Switch back to you,
and back to you.

15:14.576 --> 15:16.142
I have the power to switch
to anyone.

15:16.144 --> 15:17.477
Wait-- what are you
talking about?

15:17.479 --> 15:19.045
You're switching
to different girls?

15:19.047 --> 15:20.880
Yeah, 'cause if I get
bored with you...

15:20.882 --> 15:22.749
You get bored with me?
Excuse me?

15:22.751 --> 15:24.884
Yeah, I'll be, like, I'm on
this one over here.

15:24.886 --> 15:27.654
Who do you think you are?
I'm an owner of a DirecTV

15:27.656 --> 15:29.923
package that allows me
to have the RedZone.

15:29.925 --> 15:32.058
Bam, bam, bam! I'm single
and I'm loving it!

15:32.060 --> 15:34.027
I'm out, asshole.
You know what?

15:34.029 --> 15:35.895
One game's over, another one's
gonna begin.

15:35.897 --> 15:38.965
What about you?
Okay, that's a man.

15:38.967 --> 15:46.005
I sucked 'em both dry!
But I only have a pair of aces!

15:46.007 --> 15:48.074
No, no.
Nope, not even close.

15:48.076 --> 15:50.043
Pair of aces!
No, not close.

15:50.045 --> 15:53.012
I am actually good at magic.
And I'm gonna invite all of you

15:53.014 --> 15:57.016
to see me perform tonight in
my magic man cave.

15:57.018 --> 16:00.553
Everyone is welcome inside
my man cave.

16:00.555 --> 16:05.024
So come into my man cave!
That's not really as bad

16:05.026 --> 16:07.360
as it sounded.
It sounded bad.

16:07.362 --> 16:10.764
Guys, I forgot to tell you,
come inside the back door,

16:10.766 --> 16:13.466
'cause that's the one
that's always open.

16:13.468 --> 16:16.569
(clicks tongue, laughs)
Did you by any chance

16:16.571 --> 16:18.605
slip anything extra in
his Vaportini?

16:18.607 --> 16:21.741
Yeah, we call it Kush
and Ciroc.

16:21.743 --> 16:23.943
And I may have put some
ketamine in there, too.

16:23.945 --> 16:25.979
Nice.
So, Andre's in a K-hole?

16:25.981 --> 16:28.548
It's a Dre-hole.
(all laugh)

16:28.550 --> 16:32.619
Okay, everyone's gonna come
back to my man cave, and I'm

16:32.621 --> 16:35.755
gonna do some magic.
But first, just for a little

16:35.757 --> 16:39.759
bit, have a nap.
That's right.

16:39.761 --> 16:47.467
Get this over and get a little
comfy cozy and... (sighs).

16:47.469 --> 16:51.104
(woman laughing)
Andre, we're entering

16:51.106 --> 16:53.606
your back door.
Ew. Ooh, this place

16:53.608 --> 16:55.508
is hideous.
Oh, it gets so much worse.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.343
Let me show you something
amazing.

16:57.345 --> 17:00.980
(both laugh)
(woman chuckles)

17:00.982 --> 17:04.083
(both moan)
(woman giggles)

17:04.085 --> 17:06.286
You know, this couch is magic.
Oh, it is?

17:06.288 --> 17:08.021
Oh, yeah.
Oh! (giggles)

17:08.022 --> 17:12.625
Oh, it feels magic.
(both moaning)

17:12.627 --> 17:17.163
Ta-da!
(couple screaming)

17:17.165 --> 17:20.433
Ah, ha-ha-ha! Ta-da!
Jesus, Andre!

17:20.435 --> 17:22.435
I mastered the Man in the Box!

17:22.436 --> 17:25.038
I mastered the Man in the Box!
You know what?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.540
Do me a favor, make my number
disappear, huh?

17:27.541 --> 17:30.009
(Andre laughs)
I mastered Man in the Box.

17:30.011 --> 17:32.545
I was trying to be man
in the box.

17:32.547 --> 17:34.447
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Ta-da!

17:34.449 --> 17:37.050
Oh, shit.
Cheer up, orgy. Whoo!

17:37.052 --> 17:39.352
No, no, no, no, it's a magic,
it's a magic trick.

17:39.354 --> 17:41.054
Oh, God.
Oh, I got to pull out

17:41.056 --> 17:42.495
of this man cave.
Andre, film this.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.040
All right, guys, let's get
a picture.

17:47.117 --> 17:49.105
Get in there.
Yes, you guys, get together

17:49.107 --> 17:51.274
with Sergeant Penico.
This is the veteran I was

17:51.276 --> 17:53.610
telling you guys about.
How did you hurt your ankle?

17:53.612 --> 17:56.212
Was it over in action?
No, no, no, no, I got in a

17:56.214 --> 17:58.147
fight with a dog over
a sandwich.

17:58.149 --> 18:00.350
Geez.
But the, um, I lost my dick

18:00.352 --> 18:01.851
in the war.
Oh, wow.

18:01.853 --> 18:03.519
All right, Sergeant.
Get the picture?

18:03.521 --> 18:05.521
I got it.
Good to see you, Sarge.

18:05.523 --> 18:07.557
Hey, Jay, never let 'em
get you down, Jay.

18:07.559 --> 18:09.826
All right.
That one has my heart.

18:09.828 --> 18:12.629
It's our life's mission to
help reassimilate people

18:12.631 --> 18:15.231
back into society by inviting
them into our fantasy

18:15.233 --> 18:17.033
football league.
Mm-hmm, we call it

18:17.035 --> 18:19.702
"The League of Dreams."
Yes, The League of Dreams.

18:19.704 --> 18:21.337
League of Dreams.
Wow.

18:21.339 --> 18:23.339
That's impressive.
Yeah. We have an AIDS

18:23.341 --> 18:25.541
patient.
Ted.

18:25.543 --> 18:28.077
And a recovering alcoholic.
Chuck. There's Ruxin,

18:28.079 --> 18:30.346
who had severe heart problems.
It's almost as if he's

18:30.348 --> 18:32.081
dead inside.
Taco the drug addict.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.017
Yeah, drug addicts.
I don't even know his

18:34.019 --> 18:35.551
real name.
And then there's Andre,

18:35.553 --> 18:37.820
our saddest case of all.
We never thought we'd get

18:37.822 --> 18:39.522
him back.
No, there was no place

18:39.524 --> 18:41.257
for him <i>in</i> society.
But he's doing

18:41.259 --> 18:43.059
much better now.
He's doing so well,

18:43.061 --> 18:44.661
he is a doctor.
BOTH: Wow.

18:44.663 --> 18:46.195
It's great to give back.
Mm-hmm.

18:46.197 --> 18:48.231
I feel awful because I feel
like we really misjudged

18:48.233 --> 18:49.499
you guys.
Completely.

18:49.501 --> 18:50.934
That seems to happen.
I don't know why.

18:50.936 --> 18:52.335
Yeah.
We should definitely

18:52.337 --> 18:54.237
hang out again.
We would love that.

18:54.239 --> 18:55.571
Oh, sure, yeah.
That'd be great.

18:55.573 --> 18:57.073
Absolutely.
Well, listen, you guys

18:57.075 --> 18:58.908
enjoy the party.
Go have some fun, and we'll

18:58.910 --> 19:00.443
catch up in a little bit.
Awesome.

19:00.445 --> 19:01.711
Thank you.
Okay.

19:01.713 --> 19:03.746
Great, guys, okay.
(Kevin sighs)

19:03.748 --> 19:05.882
We are going to hell.
Yeah, and we're taking

19:05.884 --> 19:07.550
the Cutlers with us.
Yep.

19:07.552 --> 19:09.185
(stomach growling)
Ooh, boy.

19:09.187 --> 19:13.423
"Ooh" what? No. No!
These bubbles need a home.

19:13.425 --> 19:15.892
Fine. Go to the bathroom,
but spray afterwards.

19:15.894 --> 19:18.428
Oh, fine.
So tell me about this

19:18.430 --> 19:20.863
League of Dreams.
The actual fantasy football

19:20.865 --> 19:23.366
knowledge in this league
is pathetic... but the

19:23.368 --> 19:26.069
message boards are great.
Did you see the post when

19:26.071 --> 19:27.637
Jenny's kid drank your
breast milk?

19:27.639 --> 19:29.138
Wait-- what?
When Jenny's kid dra...

19:29.140 --> 19:30.907
when she stole your breast milk.
No.

19:30.909 --> 19:33.276
So you're the one that
stole my breast milk?

19:33.278 --> 19:35.578
No.
Yes, you did.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.381
Okay, yes, but there's a
perfectly good explanation.

19:38.383 --> 19:40.316
Oh, please tell.
Well, Taco was throwing

19:40.318 --> 19:42.485
this huge party...
Whoa. The addict?

19:42.487 --> 19:46.089
Yes. And Kevin's mom kept
testing my breast milk with

19:46.091 --> 19:48.458
these Breastalyzer...
So you stole my breast milk

19:48.460 --> 19:50.560
so that you could get wasted?
I'm sensing a little

19:50.562 --> 19:52.462
judgment here.
Breast milk's good if you

19:52.464 --> 19:54.597
ever...
Like, you just got to flavor it.

19:54.599 --> 19:56.232
Oh, God! Jay!
Maple syrup.

19:56.234 --> 20:02.238
(Kevin groaning)
Oh, I'm gonna blow.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.743
(groans)
Oh, my God!

20:06.745 --> 20:12.482
Need spray! It stinks!
Oh, God!

20:12.484 --> 20:17.587
Oh, no!
Oh, cock, shit, mother, balls!

20:17.589 --> 20:20.323
Kevin? We gotta go!
She's the one that stole

20:20.325 --> 20:22.025
my breast milk.
What?

20:22.027 --> 20:24.694
Kevin, we gotta go.
Oh, my God.

20:24.696 --> 20:26.996
(Kristin gasps)
What did you do?

20:26.998 --> 20:29.132
I spray-painted
their bathroom cabinet.

20:29.134 --> 20:31.200
It must have been left over
from the construction.

20:31.202 --> 20:33.669
Why are you spraying it?
Because I had a bubble.

20:33.671 --> 20:36.172
Dude, you can't do that here.
Well, if you can't fart

20:36.174 --> 20:38.941
in the bathroom, Jay, then I ask
you where can one fart?

20:38.943 --> 20:41.611
You animal! Even in war
you don't do that!

20:41.731 --> 20:43.774
Oh, I got another one coming.
Sorry.
