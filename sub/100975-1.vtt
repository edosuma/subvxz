We were once called the quirkiest church
in Fishtown.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.518
[laughs] I think it froze, too!

03:47.602 --> 03:50.063
I think we've done a lot
to earn that name.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.608
I live right next door to the church

03:53.691 --> 03:55.777
in a house owned by the church,

03:59.239 --> 04:02.075
-Does he have cats?
-Oh, my gosh!

04:03.326 --> 04:06.829
By virtue of who we are
and how small our congregation is,

04:06.913 --> 04:11.251
Noah's saddled with a lot more
than pastoral responsibilities.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.710
[woman] It's three o'clock in the morning,

04:12.794 --> 04:17.257
Pastor Noah's over there
mopping up the church floor!

04:17.340 --> 04:19.092
Say what? I mean, who's doing that?

04:21.302 --> 04:22.387

04:35.858 --> 04:38.486
-Good morning.
-Good morning, everyone.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.154
Noah is an introvert.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.533
I am single.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.744
It can be a challenge to date as a pastor.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.372
But also, I'm gay,

04:49.455 --> 04:52.208
and I have struggled with my identity
as a gay person.

04:53.084 --> 04:58.214
[Jonathen]
Noah was brought up in a very homophobic,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.800
fundamentalist, Baptist denomination.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.762
[Noah]
I was taught that queer people were wrong

05:04.846 --> 05:06.597
and probably going to hell.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.643
In seminary, I met a woman,

05:10.727 --> 05:14.564
a wonderful person, and I thought,
"Oh, maybe this is it."

05:14.647 --> 05:19.652
That I can have that kind of life that
at the time I thought was

05:19.736 --> 05:22.280
the only real, acceptable option.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.492
One of the first two people I came out to
was my wife.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.163
After the divorce,
I moved to Philadelphia,

05:30.288 --> 05:33.416
to experience something different,
a new chapter of life.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.710
Finding a community like Atonement

05:35.793 --> 05:39.005
to be able to serve,
I feel really blessed,

05:39.088 --> 05:41.007
but we're a struggling congregation.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.844
If we have 30 in the pews on a Sunday,
that's a pretty decent Sunday for us.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.889
[Noah] Maybe I need to step up my game
a little bit.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.767
Maybe building some more confidence
as a leader

05:50.850 --> 05:53.603
of this congregation,
and a leader in the church at large.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.606

We've been walking through the desert

of this, like, life together,
and he doesn't even know!

06:01.736 --> 06:05.907
And there's a pizza place
right by our church. Oh, my God!

06:05.990 --> 06:07.909
I love that people call you Jesus.

Okay, I get that situation. Uh-huh.

10:53.611 --> 10:57.948
If you find one,
you find many cargo shorts. Cargo short.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.451
Ooh, cargo short with a belt,
even less flattering.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.078
[Jonathan] What you want to learn?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.997
Are you curious about your look?
Are you curious about this new beard?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.749
This is kind of the look I inherited.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.418
I have mixed feelings about this.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.422
Like, I don't know how to work with that.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.424
I think you look really handsome
with a beard.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.551
-Thank you.
-Kind of a little daddy.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.969
You know, kind of a daddy

11:19.053 --> 11:21.472
who's also just a pastor,
which is gorgeous.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.265
And I'm so excited get started this week.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.225
Me, too.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.687
Oh, my God,
you're a really good hugger, queen!

11:27.770 --> 11:28.938
-[laughs]
-Love!

11:30.731 --> 11:32.400
[Antoni] He has an extensive library.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.570
[Jonathan]
He's got a lot of different body sprays.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.823
I don't see any queer literature anywhere.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.033
-[Antoni] There's queer theology.
-[Karamo] Really?

11:41.742 --> 11:44.453
-[gasps] Go on, you can do it.
-[Jonathan] Jenga!

11:44.537 --> 11:47.289
There's an extensive library,
and there's only two queer books.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
-[Tan] Do you have it? We don't have it.
-Oh!

11:50.126 --> 11:53.003
[Antoni] Oh, my God. These are good!

11:54.714 --> 11:58.592
[Bobby] I look around,
and I know that this isn't safe.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.095
The church council approved construction

12:01.178 --> 12:03.514
to begin to renovate the parsonage.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.435
Is there another space in the church
that we could zhuzh up?

12:07.518 --> 12:10.646
And then little by little,
you'll be able to slowly get it

12:10.730 --> 12:13.399
to where it's safe for you
to be breathing this air.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.359
I think that would be great.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.486
[Jonathan]
Come here, baby, come get your little toy.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.572
Do you want to play-- ooh. [kisses]

12:19.655 --> 12:21.115
Come here, bitten.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.744
Noah cannot live in the parsonage
that he's in now.fa

12:24.827 --> 12:27.830
I've gotta find him a space
that he can live in

12:27.913 --> 12:31.000
until the church does something
about the condition of that home.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.754
[Jonathan] We love safety! We love safety!

12:35.713 --> 12:36.839
[Antoni] I love an alley.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.843
-Okay, I'm seeing less health hazards.
-[laughs] Yeah!

12:40.926 --> 12:42.136
[both] That's a plus.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.597
[Bobby]
I'm seeing beautiful stained-glass window.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.391
This kind of reminds me
of Whoopi Goldberg's room

12:47.475 --> 12:50.102
-in<i> Sister Act </i>one!
-[laughing]

12:50.186 --> 12:52.855
I love the smell of pine.
I appreciate the pine candles.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.231
It's a wonderful space.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.568
[Bobby] It's very cool. I think this would
be much healthier for you

12:57.651 --> 12:59.612
-and bigger and brighter and happier.
-[Noah] Yeah.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.823
[Antoni] What was your upbringing like?
Where were you raised?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.201
I grew up in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.496
-Mm-hmm.
-The meal that really stands out to me,

13:08.871 --> 13:09.955
pinto beans and cornbread.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.917
-Pinto beans and cornbread. Okay.
-Pinto beans and cornbread.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.335
You're a southern man, absolutely.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.629
[gasps]

13:18.422 --> 13:20.216
What in gay hell?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.594
[Karamo] Faith and religion
is really important to me.

13:23.677 --> 13:28.432
So to hear that we have a pastor that
identifies as part of the LGBT community

13:28.516 --> 13:30.392
is really amazing for me.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.228
What was that journey like for you?

13:33.020 --> 13:36.106
At first, I think it was like,
"I finally get to be me."

13:36.732 --> 13:39.360
Then it was like,
"Oh, crap, this is really hard."

13:40.152 --> 13:43.155
The church wasn't really ready
for openly gay clergy.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.865
You could be openly gay in the pew,

13:45.616 --> 13:49.119
but you couldn't be an openly gay pastor.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.581
In 2009, our group of Lutherans

13:52.665 --> 13:55.918
made a decision that would allow
openly gay clergy.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.296
You know what's interesting to me
is you found yourself

13:59.380 --> 14:02.675
to a place now where you're proud
of being gay,

14:02.758 --> 14:06.136
yet when I look around,
I see the physical manifestation

14:06.220 --> 14:07.805
of some type
of stress you're going through.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.725
Yeah. I wasn't able to come out
until much later in life,

14:11.809 --> 14:14.144
and I wasn't at the forefront

14:14.228 --> 14:16.772
of people leading the church
into greater acceptance.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.607
I felt guilty.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.778
I have a severe case of impostor syndrome.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.989
-Huge.
-Yeah.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.200
Like, am I really the best person
for them here?

14:28.284 --> 14:31.912
This is a community that's struggling
for survival, and I need to...

14:33.956 --> 14:36.959
I need to be a leader.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.377
And you're ready?

14:38.460 --> 14:39.461
I am ready.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.673
I think that's why you guys are here.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.466
Yeah.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.428
[Noah] Thank you.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.346
[Karamo]
You're welcome. Thanks for being honest.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.559
-To a complete stranger!
-[laughs] Well, you're easy to talk to.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.937
[Karamo] So what do you hope

14:57.021 --> 14:59.440
that you'll get at the end of this week
from each of us?

14:59.982 --> 15:03.402
We have our 125th anniversary coming up.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.280
I'm hoping to be a better leader,

15:06.363 --> 15:07.656
a more public voice

15:07.740 --> 15:09.617
for this kind of Christianity,

15:09.700 --> 15:12.328
especially in this kind of environment.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.454
[Tan] Great.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.581
-[Karamo] Good.
-[Jonathan] Snaps for that, honey, yes!

15:15.998 --> 15:18.125

<i>Or maybe it's more often ♪</i>

15:23.130 --> 15:25.341
<i>♪ Fork in the road</i>
<i>And I'm questioning... ♪</i>

15:25.424 --> 15:28.260
[Antoni] Noah only wants the best
for Atonement, and to accomplish that,

15:28.344 --> 15:30.804
he needs to be out there in the field,

15:30.888 --> 15:32.932
meeting people and breaking bread.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.853
He's got a whole look going on under there
that he doesn't even realize that he has.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.565
I'm ready to get the outside to match
all that's going on on the inside.

15:42.733 --> 15:47.321
My goal this week is to get Noah out
of that home that's not safe for him.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.448
The church is renovating the parsonage,

15:49.531 --> 15:52.826
so besides giving Noah a new place
to lay his head,

15:52.910 --> 15:56.580
we're gonna be giving the community space
and the sanctuary a much-needed facelift.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.834
When you come out at a later stage,
you start to relive those teenage years,

16:00.918 --> 16:02.920
and I think he just got stuck in there.

16:03.253 --> 16:06.966
I want to show Noah versions
of classic clothing

16:07.049 --> 16:09.718
that definitely is more appropriate
for who he is

16:09.802 --> 16:12.179
and what he wants outside of work.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.808
All the messages he received
from the church early on

16:15.891 --> 16:17.643
are still with him.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.645
For me to get Noah to a place

16:19.728 --> 16:23.524
where he can accept his present
and start working on a better future,

16:23.607 --> 16:25.818
he has to resolve the trauma
from his past.

[Antoni] This is your station,
right over here.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.963
[Tan] Noah, don't look so nervous.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.715
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for gorgeous Noah!

16:47.798 --> 16:49.591
[cheering]

16:49.717 --> 16:51.301
Noah is very comfortable in his church,

16:51.385 --> 16:53.387
around his council, in his apartment,

16:53.470 --> 16:56.056
on his couch with his books and his DVDs,

16:56.140 --> 16:57.891
but he needs to be more comfortable
going out

16:57.975 --> 17:00.436
and just communicating
and being around people.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.815
My name is Noah Hepler.
I'm the pastor at Atonement Lutheran

17:04.898 --> 17:07.443
in the Fishtown neighborhood here
in Philadelphia.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.154
We have brought with us a gaggle of gays

17:10.237 --> 17:13.949
to help Noah see
that he can be himself completely.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.451
The room is full of us.

17:15.534 --> 17:19.246
I wanted to make this
a fun culinary experience

17:19.329 --> 17:20.998
'cause we're actually here to help Noah.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.876
Remind us, please, what's going on
at the end of the week.

17:23.959 --> 17:28.213
So, Atonement is celebrating
its 125th anniversary.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.842
We are going to have
an amazing worship service

17:31.925 --> 17:36.013
and just kind of blowout party,
the only way that Atonement can do it,

17:36.096 --> 17:38.348
and that's gotta include food.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.643
To actually honor
Noah's southern heritage,

17:41.727 --> 17:43.520
we're making a skillet cornbread,

17:43.604 --> 17:45.314
a really classic, simple recipe,

17:45.397 --> 17:47.900
but we're gonna customize it
with some extra elements.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.359
We made some brown butter.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.821
It's gonna add nice dark color
around the edges of our cornbread.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.450
Take the brown butter
and pour it into the bowl. Beautiful.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.619
Now we can take the maple syrup

17:58.702 --> 18:00.746
and then gently just pour it
into the brown butter.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.372
Now we have buttermilk.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.584
Gently just drizzle this in
to our nice little mixture.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.878
-You're doing great.
-I'm doing it.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.630
Making cornbread.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.551
So, you're gonna go ahead
and crack three eggs.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.345
-[Jonathan] You wanna do one on my head?
-[Tan] Yeah.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.474
-[Antoni] Oh, my gosh, you're nightmares.
-[laughing]

18:20.557 --> 18:23.393
Anyway, for the rest of you,
our dry ingredients,

18:23.477 --> 18:26.730
cornmeal, wholewheat flour,
bleached flour,

18:26.814 --> 18:28.107
baking soda,

18:28.565 --> 18:29.608
baking powder,

18:30.025 --> 18:31.902
a nice little pinch of salt.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.947
[Jonathan] Your batter's looking
really velvety and great.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.073
I'm very proud of it.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.200
Antoni, look at how great
his batter is looking.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.118
Yeah.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.286
-Have you been neglecting yours?
-No!

18:42.204 --> 18:43.747
Okay, jalapeños.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.415
I love jalapeños!

18:45.499 --> 18:47.835
If you want it little hotter,
use the seeds.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.629
You throw in your jalapeños.
into your batter mix.

18:51.421 --> 18:55.300
Damn, Noah, you went off
on your jalapeños!

18:55.384 --> 18:57.511
You have, like, a whole chunk!
That's brilliant.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.097
You're about to burn somebody's house down
with that, honey!

19:00.472 --> 19:01.640
[Antoni] Last step, guys.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.643
So, our oven is set to 350.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.812
-Go ahead and plop that right in there.
-[Jonathan] Yeah, be careful.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.480
Nailing it.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.440
[Antoni] So, this one can go right here.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.693
I actually want Noah to walk around.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.736
We're engaging, we're interacting.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.282
For his congregation to grow,
outreach is imperative.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.491
[laughing]

19:19.575 --> 19:21.785
[Antoni] Noah is stepping up to the plate.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.705
He can be a leader
by just leaning into who he already is

19:24.788 --> 19:26.415
and knowing that that's enough.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.584
Now that you got to meet
all your new friends,

19:28.667 --> 19:31.712
I think it would be maybe nice
to invite them for the end of the week.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.506
Yes. I would love for all of you
to join us

19:34.590 --> 19:37.384

this Saturday.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.970

-Yes!

19:40.053 --> 19:41.597
-[Antoni] I think they're ready.
-[Jonathan] Yay!

-Okay, I'll take excited.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.114
What are we excited about?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.325
Um, new opportunities.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.704
I feel like I'm not
putting my best self out there.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.208
Okay. You're done with work,
you've got a few minutes to get ready,

20:09.291 --> 20:10.500
what are you wearing?

20:11.126 --> 20:15.130
In this weather, I'd probably try
to find my nicest pair of shorts.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.382
Okay. When you come out
a little bit later,

20:17.466 --> 20:20.802
a lot of the time, many people revert back
to their teenage selves,

20:20.886 --> 20:24.223
which is when they probably wanted
to come out.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.350
When I saw your cargo shorts,

20:26.433 --> 20:29.144
-I thought that's also a clear sign
-Yeah. [laughs]

20:29.228 --> 20:31.063
of somebody who was reliving their youth.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.981
-Yeah.
-He's a middle-aged man.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.275
No longer can we accept the cargo shorts.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.320
If this even were more fitted,

20:38.403 --> 20:40.072
-do you see what that does for your legs?
-Yeah.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.574
-Immediately, they look longer.
-Yeah.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.910
Right now, you're drowning
in your clothes.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.162
And on a teenager, fine.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.164
-But I want you to look respectable,
-Yes.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.375
and I want to make your wardrobe
as easy as possible.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.170
The reason why I wanted
to bring you to a store like this

20:55.254 --> 20:57.130
is because they do simple very, very well.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.091
Any one of these things that you mix
will work.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.008
Okay.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.011
I guess all I'm saying is I want you
to look sexy.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.555
I don't know if I can say that
to a pastor, but I want you to.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.474
-Okay?
-[laughs] Okay.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.893
-Are you ready to try on whatever I want?
-Yes.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.358
-All right, Tan.
-Oh, hello!

21:16.441 --> 21:18.819
-You look so good!
-Oh, thank you.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.112
Come take a look at yourself.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.822
-Okay.
-Let's talk about it.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.992
-It's different.
-Yes.

21:25.909 --> 21:29.204
Um... there are things I'm not sure about.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.206
Hit me with it.
I'll take whatever you've got.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.584
I'm not sure that this particular jacket

21:34.668 --> 21:36.837
-is bringing it for me.
-Okay.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.465
I don't know. Maybe it feels plain?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.591
Plain? All right.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.886
I was worried that we couldn't go jazzier,
but okay.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.346
-Shall we try something else?
-Sure.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.181
I've got something that has
a little bit more detail to it.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.141
Okay.

21:51.852 --> 21:52.853
Is that better?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.731
Oh, Noah, you look hot.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.316
Take a look.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.570
-[Noah] I definitely like this.
-Love.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.280
This top part is feeling really good.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.824
I think we could go slightly slimmer
on the pants.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.909
-A little bit more shape would be nice.
-Yeah.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.911
[Tan] Could it be a date look?

22:09.995 --> 22:11.705
[Noah] I definitely would wear this.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.166
That makes me happy. Did we nail it?

22:14.249 --> 22:15.417
-I think so.
-Okay, good.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.210
Hello.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.503
[Tan] Hello, Bobby Berk.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.797
-[Bobby] Look at you!
-[Tan] Doesn't he look so nice?

22:20.881 --> 22:23.008
-We're wearing opposites today.
-[laughing]

22:23.091 --> 22:24.718
Go get changed. Thank you, my love.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.430
-Aww, good job. [moans]
-Thanks, my love. It's been a good one.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.057
That was fun, but let me tell you,

22:30.140 --> 22:32.768
the difficult thing with Noah is that

22:32.851 --> 22:36.063
I think we need to draw out
who he really is,

22:36.146 --> 22:38.231
'cause he's not showing that in any way.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.025
Not in his style.
Not in the way he presents.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.234
He's got the all black down.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.653
Maybe it's just purely a confidence thing.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.156
-He's wearing what makes him feel safe.
-Yeah.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.992
That's what he's accepted as,
he's accepted as the minister,

22:49.076 --> 22:50.494
so he stays in that box.

22:50.577 --> 22:54.081
We need to help him feel comfortable
with that other part of his life,

22:54.164 --> 22:56.083
-which is who he is as a person.
-Yeah.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.293
-His real life, not just the job.
-[Bobby] Yeah.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.754
Hello, dear. Are you ready to go?

23:00.837 --> 23:04.633
I am saddened to see you back in this,
it hurts my heart a little bit.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.842
-It's not your look.
-I'm hiding in it.

23:05.926 --> 23:10.013
We're gonna empower you
to feel amazing and perfectly safe

23:10.097 --> 23:11.681
in more daring outfits.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.558
-Thank you.
-Wait until you see your closets.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.685
Thank you. I'm gonna continue to shop.
Bye, boys!

23:18.939 --> 23:21.066
[Bobby] So, how's it been thus far?

23:21.149 --> 23:23.402
I've had a lot of fun, lots of surprises.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.861
Learned anything yet?

23:24.945 --> 23:27.948
Yeah, learning to just kind of go
with the flow.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.742
-That's a hard thing to do sometimes.
-Sometimes it is.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.161
Especially, like, the church, you know.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.539
[Bobby]
You've been a minister there how long now?

23:35.622 --> 23:37.707
I've been there right around five years.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.377
And what are your plans going forward?

23:40.752 --> 23:44.339
We want to create friendship
with the community that we're in.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.675
That also means having
honest conversations.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.511
The church is quick to try to fix things

23:49.594 --> 23:52.055
without owning the damage that was done.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.683
And that's one of the things
that I want to change

23:54.766 --> 23:55.892
and advocate for, like,

23:55.976 --> 24:00.355
"No, let's own those moments
that we've hurt people."

24:00.439 --> 24:06.778
And we need to do some real apology
and real reconciliation around that.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.281
Christianity cloaks itself as

24:09.364 --> 24:11.366
a loving, safe space,

24:11.450 --> 24:13.368
but that's not the church we grew up with.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.327
No.

24:15.704 --> 24:19.833
The faith has been used against us,
and it should not have been.

24:20.375 --> 24:24.880
There are a lot of stories in the Bible,
they're in there, and they're not told.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.548
-Right.
-For example,

24:26.631 --> 24:30.260
there's the one where the centurion goes
to Jesus and says,

24:30.343 --> 24:33.722
"My slave is ill,
and I want you to heal him."

24:33.805 --> 24:36.850
The Greek word that's used there is,
he says, "My beloved."

24:36.933 --> 24:39.186
If you take into account
historical distance,

24:39.269 --> 24:40.228
it means boyfriend.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.190
And Jesus doesn't say anything about that,

24:43.273 --> 24:44.608
he just heals the guy.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.777
Wow! Where did you read that in the Bible?

24:47.861 --> 24:51.114
It's a very short story,
but it's very powerful, and it's like,

24:51.198 --> 24:52.741
there we are,

24:52.824 --> 24:56.495
and yet the story has been retold

24:56.578 --> 24:58.497
in a way that leaves us out.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.917
I would like for the rest
of the Lutheran world

25:02.000 --> 25:03.376
to kind of see that.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.588
<i>♪ Every day is a new day ♪</i>

25:06.671 --> 25:08.673
<i>♪ Go ahead, pop champagne ♪</i>

25:09.674 --> 25:13.386
[Bobby] I wanted to get some new flags
designed for your sanctuary.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.847
-After you, sir.
-Thank you.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.767
[Bobby] I wanted you to see
the different things we can do.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.852
I noticed a lot of teal around.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.898
Show me teal. [laughs]

25:25.065 --> 25:26.608
I'll show you some fabric swatches.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.817
-[Noah] Show me teal.
-All right.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.277
-So this is the teal.
-[Noah] Okay.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.154
-[Bobby] I think that'll look very pretty.
-[Noah] Yeah.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.156
There's some of that color
in the stained-glass windows.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.074
[Noah] Yeah.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.784
[man]
Also what's cool about teal is this is

25:35.867 --> 25:37.536
a very traditional
Philadelphia green color.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.912
-Yeah.
-You'll see it everywhere.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.998
So, fabric-wise,
we can do a couple of different things.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.669
We can print it,
but what I had in mind was this,

25:45.752 --> 25:46.962
where it's stitched on.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.297
-Yeah.
-I wanted to make sure

25:49.381 --> 25:51.299
that I put this up on the wall,

25:51.383 --> 25:53.051
celebrating 125 years,

25:53.134 --> 25:57.013
because I want everyone to remember
how the church has evolved.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.557
-Yeah.
-How far we've come.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.518
We can make sure that every single day,

26:01.601 --> 26:05.564
we're fighting for the next 125 years
to be even better.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.357
I think we're going to love it.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.441
[man] All right, cool.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.577
<i>♪ No one's going on their own ♪</i>

26:20.537 --> 26:22.414
[man vocalizing]

26:26.042 --> 26:29.337
[Karamo] It's important for Noah
to be around other LGBTQ clergy,

26:29.421 --> 26:33.216
so that he can understand
that he's not alone in his struggles.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.136
You got two people who are amazing.

26:36.219 --> 26:40.807
Bishop Guy Erwin, the first openly gay
bishop of the Lutheran faith.

26:40.890 --> 26:44.477
[Guy] I was honored that they asked me
to come and be with you in this time.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.229
I've followed you on social media,

26:46.313 --> 26:48.815
I know you're a conscientious
and dedicated pastor,

26:48.898 --> 26:50.317
and I appreciate what you do.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.069
-I mean, powerful.
-[laughs]

26:53.153 --> 26:57.532
[Karamo] And Pastor Megan,
first openly trans pastor

26:57.616 --> 26:58.617
in the Lutheran church.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.661
I was one of the extraordinarily
ordained pastors,

27:01.745 --> 27:05.790
which means that I was one of the pastors
who got ordained and lived openly

27:05.874 --> 27:08.460
during the time
when the church was saying no.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.213
The issues that you're having today,
and the reason that

27:12.297 --> 27:13.882
you don't have the present

27:13.965 --> 27:16.635
or the future you want
is because of your past.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.180
We have to figure out what got you
to this place where you felt

27:20.263 --> 27:21.389
like an impostor,

27:21.473 --> 27:22.932
so that we can come forward.

27:25.518 --> 27:28.146
I had always avoided

27:29.648 --> 27:32.525
saying that I was gay.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.485
[Megan] Sure.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.531
Because of the church's lack
of acceptance.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.158
But I feel held back

27:41.117 --> 27:42.077
by my past.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.413
And I feel like I can't be the kind of

27:45.497 --> 27:47.832
leader in the church,

27:47.916 --> 27:50.126
not just my own congregation,
but in the church,

27:50.210 --> 27:51.336
that I could be.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.714
I keep running a negative script
about myself

27:54.798 --> 27:57.467
in my head, because I didn't step up

27:57.550 --> 27:59.969
within the larger story
of the queer community.

28:00.053 --> 28:00.970
I haven't gotten over it.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.808
[Guy] Your story and mine
are not entirely different.

28:04.891 --> 28:05.892
I know how it hurts.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.853
I am very deeply sorry for the pain

28:08.937 --> 28:10.146
that you have felt.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.982
Our world needs you right now.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.818
-Yeah.
-[Megan] It's calling you.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.404
There's not a month that goes by

28:17.487 --> 28:19.906
that I don't get messages

28:19.989 --> 28:24.869
and letters from parents who say,
"My kids think they can't go to church,

28:24.953 --> 28:27.706
but the good news that you put out online

28:27.789 --> 28:30.542
makes me think that maybe
there is a place for them in the future."

28:30.625 --> 28:32.627
There's a kid in my congregation.

28:33.086 --> 28:33.920
[Megan] Yeah.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.341
I've been waiting for him to come out
since the first time I met him.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.429
His mom and his grandma
have been waiting for him to come out

28:42.762 --> 28:45.306
since he was four. [laughs]

28:45.390 --> 28:47.225
-He came out this year.
-[Megan] Yes.

28:47.308 --> 28:51.646
And I am just... elated

28:51.730 --> 28:52.981
that for him,

28:53.064 --> 28:55.024
the one place that won't tell him

28:55.108 --> 28:57.819
anything bad about who he is

28:57.902 --> 28:58.945
will be his church.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.325
[Megan] Would you ever tell that kid
in your congregation

29:04.409 --> 29:05.744
they didn't come out soon enough?

29:06.161 --> 29:06.995
[Noah] No.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.456
So why do you tell yourself that,
child of God?

29:14.878 --> 29:16.004
Thank you.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.841
[Karamo] What's going on?

29:22.260 --> 29:23.595
I needed to hear that.

29:29.559 --> 29:30.393
[sighs]

29:32.604 --> 29:33.646
You have no idea.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.064
-You're talking about the calling.
-[Guy] Amen.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.776
Whoo! You are right where
you're supposed to be, brother.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.527
-You have no idea!
-[laughs]

29:39.611 --> 29:40.653
[Megan] And I'm so glad,

29:40.737 --> 29:43.698
'cause my shoulders are tired
and there needs to be more of us.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.826
-And Guy's in there, too.
-We need more, all the time.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.205
Every word of grace we say,
it has an impact,

29:50.288 --> 29:51.998
whether we ever see it or not.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.877
We are communicating constantly,
God's love to other people.

29:55.960 --> 30:00.757
And to do so as an out gay pastor,
even without saying more than that,

30:00.840 --> 30:03.927
who you are preaches,
and people need to hear that.

30:04.010 --> 30:08.264
[Megan] Just remember,
in the days when it's hard,

30:08.348 --> 30:09.682
that all pastors are struggling,

30:09.766 --> 30:12.560
no matter how together they look
on Facebook.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.230
And that you're not alone,

30:15.313 --> 30:16.606
that you have colleagues.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.859
And I don't come by myself,
I come with a cloud of witnesses

30:19.943 --> 30:23.988
and saints who join me,
in part, 'cause I brought you this.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.742
This stole was passed down
to 11 different pastors

30:28.034 --> 30:28.993
who were ordained

30:29.077 --> 30:30.870
outside of the official rules
of the church,

30:30.954 --> 30:34.624
but because they felt called
to serve openly and authentically.

30:34.707 --> 30:37.377
And this stole gets passed down

30:37.460 --> 30:39.504
because we know that we're a part

30:39.587 --> 30:42.507
of a long, faithful calling.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.468
We don't think any of us
should carry it alone and keep it.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.636
So I'm gonna give it to you

30:46.719 --> 30:50.431
and call you to this new calling
that you're embracing,

30:50.515 --> 30:53.768
with the hope that you will pass this
along to the next person

30:53.852 --> 30:56.729
who needs to hear that same message.
And you'll know when it's right.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.439
Right?

31:02.527 --> 31:06.531
You are a part of the great calling

that came to you in your baptism.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.793
And you get to preach openly

Thank you. Amen.

31:38.354 --> 31:42.609

judgment and pain.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.360

[Jonathan] Baby Noah is a pastor,

what might look the best for me.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.760
I'm feeling short hair on top,
but then gorgeous beard.

32:50.843 --> 32:54.055
One way to make a beard
give a little bit more of a polished look

32:54.138 --> 32:58.309
is when you have a barber who knows how
to fade the beard

32:58.393 --> 32:59.560
to, like, the haircut.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.562

I get that.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.808
The church owes you an apology.

my first thought is always, "Hell, no."
No pun intended.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.452

38:50.119 --> 38:51.996

38:52.079 --> 38:54.707
if churches like this
started happening more,

38:54.790 --> 38:57.460
there might be a chance
I would bring my kids to a church.

-[Tan] I'm bringing my coffee.
-[Bobby] Jonny's hungry.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.326
That is a really, really, really, really,
really, really, pretty jacket.

41:35.409 --> 41:37.453
What did I tell you when I saw you today?

41:37.536 --> 41:40.122
-This is what you buried your grandma in?
-It is.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.291
-[laughing]
-[Tan] I wanted you to feel really at home

41:42.374 --> 41:44.001
so I decided to wear this

41:44.084 --> 41:45.878
-to bring you comfort and joy.
-[Karamo] Tanny!

41:45.961 --> 41:49.423
Tan-- Karamo-- I mean Bobby! Oh, my God!
[laughs]

41:49.507 --> 41:52.259
-My grandma's spirit just came into me!
-[laughing]

41:52.343 --> 41:53.761
That's what she used to do!

41:53.844 --> 41:57.556
-Can't remember any of our names.
-Oh, my God, that's insane!

41:57.640 --> 41:59.934
-[laughing]
-On that note, let's go.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.602
-[Karamo] Yeah!
-[Tan] Come on.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.604
-Let's do this.
-Fives, are you ready?

42:03.687 --> 42:07.525

-[Antoni] Yeah, good one, Karamo!

42:12.488 --> 42:15.741

-Noah!

42:18.410 --> 42:20.037
[Fab 5] 125 years!

42:20.120 --> 42:22.498
I feel like this is a new beginning
for him and the church.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.041
Looks good.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.960
Looks real good.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.586
-He's go a nice beard.
-[Karamo] He's super handsome.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.630
He looks lovely.

42:31.632 --> 42:32.800
[sighs]

42:34.260 --> 42:35.886
[woman] All right. Can't wait.

42:36.595 --> 42:37.596
Oh, here they come.

42:44.603 --> 42:45.521
Look at this!

42:45.604 --> 42:47.815
[woman] Yeah, seriously!

42:47.898 --> 42:49.525
-You're gorgeous, dude.
-You look amazing.

42:49.608 --> 42:50.901
Aww!

42:50.985 --> 42:51.944
Fabulous.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.697
-Fabulous is what we're going for.
-[laughing]

42:54.780 --> 42:57.032
-You're pretty, but let's see the church.
-Are you ready?

42:57.116 --> 42:59.118
-Can we?
-Come on in.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.995
[all] Wow!

43:02.121 --> 43:05.749
-I love, love!
-[laughing]

43:05.833 --> 43:08.627
-Wow!
-Unbelievable!

43:08.711 --> 43:11.338
This is so<i> Sister Act,</i>
and I love it so much.

43:11.422 --> 43:15.050
This is like disco church now.
This is fabulous!

43:15.134 --> 43:17.177
The quirkiest church in Fishtown, right?

43:17.261 --> 43:19.388
-We got the rainbow lights.
-[Zoa] Amen!

43:19.805 --> 43:20.806
[Jonathan] Aww.

43:20.889 --> 43:24.101
Walter, I need you to calm down. Hey, sit!

43:24.393 --> 43:26.103
-[yelps]
-[laughing]

43:26.186 --> 43:28.814
[Jonathan] Aww, Bobby, they love what you
did with the church so much.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.358
-[Noah] <i>There's more.</i>
-[gasping]

43:31.442 --> 43:34.445
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

43:34.528 --> 43:36.155
[woman] Oh, my God.

43:37.072 --> 43:39.491
-[Noah laughs]
-[man] Whoa! Noah!

43:39.575 --> 43:43.037
-[woman] Noah, Look!
-[Zoa] Look at this coffee maker!

43:43.120 --> 43:45.623
We can have cappuccino!

43:45.706 --> 43:47.124
-Look at this.
-They got matching plates.

43:47.207 --> 43:49.001
-[Zoa] Oh, my God!
-[Noah laughs] We are stocked.

43:49.084 --> 43:52.087
Coffee, coffee, I'm in heaven!

43:52.171 --> 43:54.048
"Coffee, coffee!"

43:54.131 --> 43:56.717
-You don't need any more caffeine.
-Woman after my own heart.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.511
-[Noah] You're my team to help get ready.
-[Renée] Got this.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.305
-Good luck.
-We got this.

44:10.189 --> 44:14.401
-The church has never been more full.
-[Karamo] You know what else is full?

44:14.985 --> 44:16.195
-Your heart?
-[Karamo] Heart.

44:16.779 --> 44:17.696
[Tan] Your gay heart?

44:17.780 --> 44:20.824
I was so ready for you to say something
disgusting, and you made it cute.

44:21.950 --> 44:23.952
[singing hymn]

44:45.474 --> 44:47.935
Grace and peace to you this day.

44:48.018 --> 44:54.441
I welcome you to this,
the 125th anniversary of Atonement.

44:54.525 --> 44:58.070
You might notice,
we got a little bit of a boost.

44:58.153 --> 44:59.613
[laughing]

44:59.697 --> 45:02.241
[Noah] You might notice,
I got a little bit of a boost.

45:03.450 --> 45:05.703
I just had a daydream where, like,
techno music came on

45:05.786 --> 45:07.204
and he started doing a striptease.

45:07.287 --> 45:09.957
I would love that. That would be amazing.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.542
[laughing]

45:11.667 --> 45:14.169
But I have not told my story,

45:14.586 --> 45:18.465
at least certainly not
to so diverse an audience.

45:18.882 --> 45:24.513
But today, the hottest,
most flaming day of the year,

45:27.099 --> 45:28.308
I'm gonna do it.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.394
[cheering]

45:33.856 --> 45:37.025
I grew up in
a very different Christian tradition.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.696
It was one that did not focus on grace.

45:40.779 --> 45:43.490
It did not focus on love.

45:44.199 --> 45:45.784
Don't listen to secular music.

45:46.952 --> 45:48.162
Don't play cards.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.581
Definitely don't dance.

45:51.832 --> 45:52.791
And so I knew,

45:53.459 --> 45:56.420
"Okay, what you feel inside,

45:57.546 --> 45:59.256
is way worse than the time

45:59.339 --> 46:02.551
that they found
that pop rock cassette tape

46:02.634 --> 46:03.927
in your book bag."

46:04.428 --> 46:09.725
I was convinced that it was a temptation
to lead me away from God.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.269
I fought it.

46:13.270 --> 46:17.566
I remember the moment
where I heard the Lord

46:17.649 --> 46:21.361
say to me, "Noah, come out."

46:21.445 --> 46:22.863
-[woman] Yes!
-[man] Yes.

46:23.614 --> 46:26.909
[Noah] But I have noticed,
over the past couple of years,

46:26.992 --> 46:29.578
that I have continued
to keep part of myself

46:29.661 --> 46:32.831
shoved in the tomb and buried,

46:32.915 --> 46:36.001
because I still felt
like there was something wrong.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.713
And then, a parishioner found a flyer.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.006
Filled it out.

46:41.715 --> 46:42.966
Kinda as a joke.

46:43.091 --> 46:45.302
-[laughing]
-[Noah] And the next...

46:47.346 --> 46:49.306
The next thing that I know,

46:49.389 --> 46:52.976
five men began to change my life.

46:54.269 --> 46:57.439
I promised, and I asked
to be held accountable,

46:57.523 --> 47:00.984
and I ask you also
to help this be a community

47:01.902 --> 47:07.074
where people, whether it's about sexuality
or race or whatever,

47:08.075 --> 47:11.578
that they do not experience
the kinds of things

47:12.538 --> 47:14.414
that Bobby and I experienced.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.876
And instead, find this
as a community of resurrection

47:17.960 --> 47:19.503
and of being let go.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.924
-Wow!
-[Bobby] I love that.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.552
Authenticity and vulnerability
in front of anyone.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.303
He's being a true courageous leader,

47:28.387 --> 47:31.390
letting the light of Jesus
just shine through him.

47:31.473 --> 47:34.810
Go in peace, be fabulous for the Lord.

47:34.893 --> 47:35.727
Amen.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.646
[both] Peace be with you.

47:39.064 --> 47:43.193
[Noah] Before this week, I continued
to carry a lot of guilt and shame,

47:43.277 --> 47:46.071
and now I see how much that was getting

47:46.154 --> 47:48.407
in my way of actually helping others.

47:48.782 --> 47:51.243
My calling is still pastor,

47:51.326 --> 47:53.954
but I feel inspired to step forward

47:54.037 --> 47:55.372
and tell my story.

47:55.455 --> 47:57.249
I am becoming

47:57.332 --> 48:00.502
the pastor that I've always wanted to be.

48:00.586 --> 48:02.588
Guys, a toast to Noah!

48:02.671 --> 48:04.298
-And to Atonement.
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

48:04.381 --> 48:06.174
And to another 125 years.

48:06.258 --> 48:09.094
-[Tan] Yes, please.
-Which equals 250.

48:09.887 --> 48:10.804
[laughs]

48:12.097 --> 48:13.891
[dog barks, whines]

48:13.974 --> 48:16.602

to get nervous.

And American Bulldog.

48:30.616 --> 48:33.660
-And most importantly, he's 100% lovable.
-Yeah.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.287
