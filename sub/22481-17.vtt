WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:04.872
* Say, it go like this,
tired of no assists 'cause...

00:06.940 --> 00:08.742
* And the punks can't play

00:08.809 --> 00:10.611
* I'm-a tell the crowd,
just do what I... *

00:14.115 --> 00:17.785
So I'm halfway to this meeting
and I realize I forgot
the client's lookbook.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.123
Honey?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.358
Where are you?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.762
Deirdre

00:29.397 --> 00:31.165
Deirdre.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.603
Didn't you hear me
calling you?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.005
A little help, please?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.410
What are you doing home?

00:43.211 --> 00:44.345
Forgot this.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.249
Good luck on your pitch.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.585
Thanks.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.963
What the hell

01:03.030 --> 01:04.265
Does it matter?

01:04.332 --> 01:06.367
When your husband shows up
unannounced, yes, it matters.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.336
PHIL: Oh, honey,
I just remembered

01:08.402 --> 01:10.571
I'm all out of that
green juice cleanse stuff.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.144
Did you hear me?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.279
Yes, and I'll pick some up
from Whole Foods

01:18.346 --> 01:19.647
on the way back
from hot yoga.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.367
STREET:
I jumped, like,

01:39.433 --> 01:41.135
twenty feet down
into this pool.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.870
The water's ice-cold.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.673
Serious shrinkage.
That must've been
tough on the ego.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.475
Then there's this
Rottweiler chasing me.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.643
I got out of there
by the skin of my teeth.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.845
You're telling me
you had no idea this
woman was married.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.381
She didn't have a ring
on her finger.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.648
Cheaters tend to
leave them at home.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.152
You might think that this is,
uh, really funny,

01:58.219 --> 02:00.588
but I actually feel used.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.955
Oh, poor Street.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.424
You attract what
you put out there.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.493
You think that I go looking
for these nutjobs?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.495
You do, because
you're telling me...
DEACON: Hey.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.863
We got a situation popping
off in the Valley. Gear up.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.270
LUCERO: Answer me!

02:16.337 --> 02:17.705
Right now!

02:17.771 --> 02:19.273
Or I'm going after
your family next!

02:24.245 --> 02:25.346
No.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.349
No!

03:22.370 --> 03:23.937
Let me see your hands!

03:25.739 --> 03:29.243
Right here,
I put a temperature scanner
so the operator can tell

03:29.310 --> 03:31.345
if the patient's still alive
or not.
MRS. SOBEL: After six months,

03:31.412 --> 03:33.747
I'm finally getting my
dining room table back?

03:33.814 --> 03:36.116
I swear, Mom,
after tomorrow,
everything's...

03:36.183 --> 03:37.651
Oh, my...
What are you doing?

03:37.718 --> 03:40.020
Shut up!
Just do what I tell you!

03:40.888 --> 03:41.989
Get in there.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.791
Move! Move!

03:43.857 --> 03:44.992
In front of
the window.
Why?

03:45.058 --> 03:49.430
On your knees.
On your knees.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.533
One-Adam-12,
suspect just forced entry
into a private residence.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.068
11874 Hazeltine.
When's S.W.A.T. getting here?

03:55.135 --> 03:57.070
One last question.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.840
How does it feel to be
the first female captain

03:59.907 --> 04:01.241
in the history
of S.W.A.T.?

04:01.309 --> 04:03.243
And how do your rank
and file feel about

04:03.311 --> 04:04.778
you pushing them
to be more involved

04:04.845 --> 04:06.314
with the communities
they police?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.248
Well, that's
two questions.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.683
It feels...right.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.251
Police Commissioner
Michael Plank,

04:11.319 --> 04:13.854
he's really my partner
in all the positive changes

04:13.921 --> 04:16.156
we're trying to implement
in the department.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.526
Oh, Stella, this is my boss,
S.W.A.T. Commander
Robert Hicks.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.128
Yeah.
You'll have to see
yourself out.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.131
Cortez, our car pursuit
just turned into
a barricade situation

04:24.197 --> 04:26.033
with hostages.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.438
"Stella"?

04:30.504 --> 04:33.106
Since when is S.W.A.T.
on first-name
basis with reporters?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.343
She's doing an article
on our latest
neighborhood initiatives.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.177
You mean your initiatives.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.280
Question, Cortez.
Do you work for S.W.A.T.
or does S.W.A.T. work for you?

04:40.348 --> 04:41.549
Sir...

04:41.615 --> 04:43.551
Want to do puff pieces
on the proposals

04:43.617 --> 04:45.553
you and the commissioner
are trying to cram down
our throat?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.120
Do it on your own time.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.189
Right now, I need you
as my number two
at Mobile Command.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.063
All right, listen up.
We got a hostage rescue
situation.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.332
We got a male Hispanic
armed with a handgun.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.967
He's taken a family hostage.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.869
Hicks and Cortez
are meeting us on-site
to give us more intel.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.537
Beautiful downtown
Van Nuys.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.939
A hundred freeway exits
and not one decent bar.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.142
Hey, at least it's hot,
muggy, and generally uncool.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.511
Don't worry, Deac,
we get you living here.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.112
You got kids.
Hey.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.314
If you're not gonna be
near the beach,
why even be in L.A.?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.249
You can all keep your
overpriced studios in Venice

05:16.316 --> 05:18.085
and your houses on stilts
in the hills.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.720
Out here, I get a real
house for my money.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.954
My kids can go
to public school.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.190
And unlike the rest of L.A.,
there's always parking.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.092
What's the verdict, Hondo?
Westside or the Valley?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.360
No, I'm sticking
with South L.A.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.528
That's always gonna be
home for me.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.896
All right,
you all know the deal.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.698
Let's keep it tight,
shut this guy down.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.542
You cut the power
and the cell service?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.444
DWP shut off
the water and power,

05:43.511 --> 05:45.646
and the cell jammer's
on full blast.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.781
No calls in or out...
Unless we want there to be.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.817
You got an ID
on our bad guy yet?
HICKS: Two bad guys.

05:49.883 --> 05:55.122
The DOA in the wrecked vehicle
has been identified
as Manuel "Man-Killer" Lopez.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.959
Lopez is a loyal assassin
for Los Reyes...
East Side Kings.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.563
The suspect who killed Lopez
and was driving his car...
Angel Lucero.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.064
HICKS:
Lucero is a career criminal.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.466
Los Reyes associate.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.100
He was recently paroled
from Corcoran

06:07.167 --> 06:08.769
after serving six years
for robbery.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.938
I dealt with Los Reyes
when they were first
coming up in Rampart.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.574
They got a reputation
for dumping bodies
where no one can find 'em.

06:13.641 --> 06:16.009
You think it's a beef
between crime partners
gone sideways?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.746
Whatever it was, there's now
an innocent family
trapped in there

06:18.812 --> 06:20.848
with a guy who's acting
like he's got nothing to lose.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.650
All right.
You try talking him out.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.385
If that doesn't work,

06:25.453 --> 06:26.654
we'll do what we do.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.593
* *

07:07.561 --> 07:09.497
Hey!

07:09.563 --> 07:11.264
You take one more step
and she's dead!

07:11.599 --> 07:12.633
Hey!

07:12.700 --> 07:13.767
HONDO: This is the L.A.P.D.!

07:13.834 --> 07:15.235
I got a phone
out here for you.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.637
Nobody is coming inside.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.338
We are not
coming inside.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.608
I just want to toss this
phone through the window

07:20.674 --> 07:22.075
so we can start
a conversation.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.777
It's coming in now.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.748
Three, two, one.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.061
This is Captain Cortez
speaking.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.863
Is this Angel Lucero?

07:42.930 --> 07:45.198
Look, I don't want to hurt
these people, but you need
to get out of here.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.001
I want that, too, so let's
work together
to make that happen.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.871
I want that big-ass S.W.A.T.
motor home bus out front gone,

07:50.938 --> 07:53.541
and I want an unmarked car
pulled up to the back of the
house for me.

07:53.607 --> 07:57.110
Angel, you understand
the L.A.P.D. can't just
pack up and leave.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.046
Well, I hear news choppers.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.516
Bet they'd love them some
live footage of dead bodies
tossed out on this lawn.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.865
I got the Rook revvin', Hondo,
ready to go in hard.

08:17.931 --> 08:18.932
Just say the word.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.233
Luca, we got
a family inside.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.102
Tear gas is a last option,
but keep her running.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.704
All right, roger that.
HONDO: Two-side,

08:23.771 --> 08:26.239
are there
any surprises inside?
Negative, Hondo.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.842
Heat signatures show
just the suspect and the
three hostages.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.343
HONDO: All right,
roger that, hold tight.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.713
Four
Suspect looks manic.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.882
Better if Cortez
can get him to walk out.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.684
HONDO: Three-side,
do you have eyes yet?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.519
Roger that. Suspect takes
one step into the back,
I got a clear shot.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.155
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.091
They said they'd kill her!
Who are they gonna kill?

08:44.157 --> 08:45.726
My sister!
They took her!

08:45.793 --> 08:47.995
You cops.
Never believe a word I say.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.897
Not with my sins.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.965
Hondo, are you hearing this?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.266
Yeah, suspect wants
a getaway car.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.068
That's his only
demand so far.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.871
If he is Los Reyes,
we cannot count on him
to do right by that family.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.306
We got to separate
him from them.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.008
Keep him talking.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.010
Angel, I worked Boyle Heights.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.311
I know Los Reyes.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.114
Lopez was a killer
who's dropped a lot of bodies.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.582
What happened between you two?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.250
Were you acting
in self

09:10.317 --> 09:11.785
Lopez was a psycho.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.721
He had that coming.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.923
I get that. But the family
you have hostage,

09:15.989 --> 09:17.991
they don't deserve
to be any part of this.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.927
Just give me a car
and two hours.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.528
Then I'll turn myself in.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.030
I just got to handle
something first.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.932
He said something about
his sister being in danger.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.300
Suspects'll spin
any fairy tale
they can conjure

09:27.367 --> 09:28.836
to get their backs
out of a corner.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.337
And even if there
was truth to it,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.339
we'd have to get
verification and we don't
have time for that.

09:33.941 --> 09:37.010
Angel, before I can
call back my men,
I need a sign of good faith.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.178
Let the hostages walk.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.819
You love your parents?
Huh?

09:46.754 --> 09:48.055
Tell 'em you love them.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.625
Mom, I love you.
I love you, babe.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.127
Dad, I love you.
I love you.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.363
All right,
you want good faith?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.498
Come get the boy!

09:58.565 --> 10:00.567
Get up. Get up. Get up.
No. No!

10:00.634 --> 10:01.869
No!
Get up.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.036
Get out of here.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.504
Go, go!

10:04.571 --> 10:06.239
Honey, go!
Go, go.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.041
Come on, go, go!
Get down!

10:09.242 --> 10:10.243
CORTEZ: Julian.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.679
Breathe and
come with me.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.113
My mom and dad?
We'll get them.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.852
All right, I gave you one,
now give me a car!

10:19.486 --> 10:20.688
No! No!

10:20.754 --> 10:22.322
Or I'm blowing his brains
outside the window.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.957
Ten!
No!

10:24.024 --> 10:25.659
Hondo, tell me you're ready.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.527
HONDO: He wants a car,
we'll throw a set of keys
through the back window.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.829
Roger that.
Six!

10:28.896 --> 10:30.497
CORTEZ: Angel, stop counting.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.666
You let a hostage go,
so I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.702
One of my men is approaching
the back of the house.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.436
He's gonna throw
a set of keys in to you.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.638
They belong to a Charger
parked in the alley.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.610
Get down.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.649
Three-side, Deac's coming
around with a stinger.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.519
But if the suspect runs out
that back door shooting,
you have a green light.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.454
Ready to drop him, Hondo.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.489
HONDO: Deac,
give him the one-two punch
and then tenderize his ass.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.470
Police! Don't move!
Don't move!

11:13.306 --> 11:14.775
Tan, cover me.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.777
Deac, we got the hostages.
Get up, you're safe.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.245
Going hands on.
Go!

11:18.311 --> 11:20.113
Give me your hands!

11:29.689 --> 11:30.858
Thank you.

11:30.924 --> 11:31.992
Glad we could help.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.796
OFFICER: Come on.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.265
Not a bad afternoon.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.432
LUCA: Hey.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.301
Teamwork makes the dream work.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.771
Man,
when are you gonna be able
to put that rig to use, Luca?

11:43.837 --> 11:45.438
I'm dying to give
that thing a spin, man.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.307
Yeah, don't worry, Luca.
Whether it's today
or next week,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.676
somebody will do
something stupid enough
for you to get your chance.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.478
Um...

11:51.544 --> 11:53.413
My drone on the dining table?

11:53.480 --> 11:54.848
Did any of you
officers see it?

11:54.915 --> 11:57.117
I hate to tell you, son,
but your house
is now a crime scene.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.821
It's gonna be a few days
before you're able to retrieve
any personal belongings.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.890
But I need it for
an engineering
competition tomorrow.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.293
I... I've been working
on this forever. Please?

12:06.359 --> 12:07.995
You know, I got to go
back inside and get my keys.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.763
Come on, what do you think,
Commander?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.865
Before we seal the place,
there's no harm in letting
the kid have a walk-through.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.868
All right, go ahead.
Thank you.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.912
Oh, my God.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.113
It's demolished.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.314
Hey, we're really sorry.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.916
You can file a claim
against the city.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.550
I mean, your
parents can.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.485
But the contest
is tomorrow morning.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.156
First prize is $25,000
for tuition.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.125
That was my best hope
of going to a real college.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.192
What kind of drone was it?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.828
I called it Medic-Hawk.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.863
Equipped with things
carried on ambulances,

12:42.930 --> 12:45.799
to help out patients
in tight spots until
human EMTs could arrive.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.535
Man, most kids
are flying their drones
over nude beaches.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.874
Tell you what. Let's salvage
every piece of this drone
that we can

12:53.941 --> 12:57.210
and take it back to HQ.
Including Einstein Jr. here.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.678
Okay. Let's do it.
All right.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.147
Oh, yeah.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.414
Come on, let's go.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.751
Is this seriously
your dating profile?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.386
Where'd you find that?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.988
I might've used the
app once or twice.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.522
Of course, I swiped
left on you,

13:09.589 --> 13:11.758
but not before I took
a screenshot of this.

13:11.825 --> 13:15.128
The dreaded shirtless pic
of you in the boxing ring,

13:15.195 --> 13:18.932
the one of you "all tac'd up
and ready to roll."
That's a good one.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.667
That's actually
the caption you wrote.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.770
I see a gainfully employed
real man

13:23.837 --> 13:26.006
who's ready to save lives
and kick ass.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.140
And with a sensitive side.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.910
You're not smiling
in any of them.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.246
Why you so serious, Street?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.048
I mean, come on,
you can tell me.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.217
Are you really the Batman?

13:37.284 --> 13:42.923
My smile...
It makes me look goofy.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.326
"No kids, ex-wife or pets.
I'm a cop who works
hard and plays hard."

13:46.393 --> 13:48.495
"Plays hard."
"If you're up
to the challenge,

13:48.561 --> 13:50.263
"you could be the one."
Mmm-hmm.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.400
Come on, in real life,
you're not that pathetic
and humorless.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.968
Do you want my opinion?
No.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.604
I think you need
to let me give
your profile a makeover.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.040
No. I might trust you
with my life,

14:00.107 --> 14:02.109
I do not trust you
with my love life.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.012
Then stop crying to me
about quickies with married,
damaged chicks.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.416
All right.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.122
Don't make me look desperate.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.256
Okay?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.765
Hey.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.968
How did you know my password?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.336
I told you,
I got you all figured out.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.472
All right, Julian,

14:32.539 --> 14:34.374
so we put your parents up
in a hotel,

14:34.441 --> 14:36.676
and they agreed that you could
be deputized by S.W.A.T.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.245
so you could pull
an all-nighter here,

14:38.311 --> 14:40.580
try to fix this thing,
win that contest.
Thanks.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.849
But one night?
I put weeks into this.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.652
One night won't cut it.
Julian, we got a full garage
and a machine shop.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.754
You just make a list
of what you need and
we got you, all right?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.289
And Luca here,
he may not look like much,

14:49.356 --> 14:51.291
but he's a real wiz
when it comes to mechanics.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.693
If I didn't become police,
MIT was next on the list.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.463
Look, kid, here at S.W.A.T.,
we face a lot of tough
situations,

14:56.529 --> 14:58.831
a lot of deadlines.
But whatever the mission,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.667
we got to buck up,
we give it a hundred percent.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.103
We're here to help,
but you got to be ready
to give it your all.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.704
We got a deal?

15:04.771 --> 15:06.239
Yes, sir.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.840
That's right.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.246
PLANK:
This is some kind of arsenal.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.148
CORTEZ:
Only the best for S.W.A.T.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.750
The reporter
from the Chronicle sent me
an early draft of the article.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.753
You crushed it.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.890
Something wrong?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.558
Hicks made a comment earlier,

15:25.625 --> 15:28.595
as if I'm more interested in
getting my name in the paper
than doing my job.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.363
I know you respect
his opinion...

15:30.430 --> 15:32.065
Hicks promoted me to S.W.A.T.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.302
He's tough on me,
but he's taught me a lot.
I'm sure he has.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.304
He's also
a decorated L.A.P.D. veteran

15:37.370 --> 15:39.339
who's watching
his protege surpass him.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.241
You're the new face
of the L.A.P.D.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.809
But Hicks is right.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.777
Don't do any more
interviews in HQ.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.113
No need to rub it in his face.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.620
OFFICER: Murder,
home invasion,

15:53.686 --> 15:55.088
kidnapping.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.423
Hope you got
a good lawyer, buddy.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.927
Get down. Get down!

16:05.465 --> 16:06.899
Are you all right?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.468
Officer injured,
give me some help!

16:08.535 --> 16:09.569
Drop the weapon!

16:10.770 --> 16:11.771
Something's going on.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.176
On the ground. On the ground!

16:24.117 --> 16:26.119
CORTEZ: Angel. Hey.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.854
Let's talk.
Cortez.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.659
You didn't want to listen
to me the first time.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.793
Stay down.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.802
You gonna listen to me
this time?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.839
Hondo!
What the hell's going on?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.908
Angel Lucero, he got loose.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.411
He's got the captain
and the commissioner
locked up in the armory.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.679
My God.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.353
Lucero!

17:00.420 --> 17:02.755
If you hurt either
one of them,
you leave here feet first!

17:02.822 --> 17:06.459
You wouldn't give me a car?
You cops gave me no choice!

17:06.526 --> 17:09.096
Chris.
Tap into the armory's
security cameras.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.430
Do it now.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.133
And for God's sakes, tell them
to shut off that alarm!

17:13.200 --> 17:14.501
ANGEL: Put those on.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.605
Hey. Hey, hey,
sit down. Sit down.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.413
My sister Abby, she's a
civilian in law school.

17:28.315 --> 17:32.018
She should've been off-limits,
but Lopez snatched her up.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.157
Angel, why would Los Reyes
kidnap your sister?

17:37.224 --> 17:41.594
To force me to steal
a safety deposit box,
some private vault.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.895
Why did they
need it to be you?

17:42.962 --> 17:45.198
I've been pulling heists
for them for years.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.000
My dad,
now, he's a real thief.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.604
He taught me how
to crack any safe,
pick any lock.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.373
But I told Los Reyes no.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.975
And they don't
like that word.
No! They don't!

17:58.978 --> 18:02.315
I just got tired of watching
my little sister grow up
from behind bars.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.983
I figured,
if I changed my life,

18:05.885 --> 18:08.555
maybe my mom and my sister
would let me back into theirs.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.393
But I get a call from
Javier Barrios this morning.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.995
Barrios.
The head of Los Reyes?

18:16.062 --> 18:19.532
He said he'd give me
Abby back in exchange for that
safety deposit box he wants.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.068
He said I had
until 2:00 a.m...

18:23.836 --> 18:25.172
...or she's dead.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.041
We're officially on lockdown.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.678
No one in or out
of the building
without my approval,

18:31.744 --> 18:33.246
and make sure
there's a press blackout.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.114
We can't have
every bad guy in the city

18:35.182 --> 18:37.384
thinking S.W.A.T. can't
respond to crimes.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.387
The armory's meant
to keep people out,
not trap them inside.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.954
If we want to take
Lucero down,

18:42.021 --> 18:43.990
we're gonna need a .50-caliber
round to pierce through that
cage door.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.792
Lucero has all our .50-cal
rifles in there.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.028
Call A.O.D.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.264
Isn't he retired?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.366
He owes me.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.868
Get him down here.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.838
Who's A.O.D.?
Angel of Death.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.608
All right, Deac,
you, Luca, and Tan,
pull up the building diagrams.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.244
See if there's a way
in that armory. You two,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.379
do a missing persons check
on Lucero's sister.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.914
You believe this guy's story?
I don't know,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.516
but the longer Plank
and Cortez are in there,

19:09.582 --> 19:10.917
the less chance
they come out alive.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.257
Hey, Julian,
we got a situation,

19:17.324 --> 19:18.858
and we're gonna need
to vacate you from here.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.159
Wait, you're kicking me out?

19:20.227 --> 19:21.894
I'm not even close
to being done.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.996
We're moving you to a secure
room on the other side
of the building.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.232
It's the safest spot in HQ.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.933
Has this got something
to do with that alarm?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.735
We're also on a complete
blackout, so no Instagram,

19:28.801 --> 19:30.102
no Facebook,
no calls to Mom and Dad.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.438
I'm gonna have
to confiscate that phone.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.172
Is this a joke?
No.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.175
Don't worry. We'll get you
moved, you'll get this bad boy
drone done in no time.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.544
Uh, that one.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.911
I'm still in triage stage,
structurally,

19:38.978 --> 19:41.214
so I need those parts first.
Hear that?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.450
Couple hours in HQ, the kid's
already barking orders.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.619
College doesn't work out,
you got a future as a S.W.A.T.
commander. Let's go.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.098
Want to see something?

20:02.669 --> 20:04.504
Angel. Let him go.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.573
He's just a civilian
who was here visiting.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.808
Sorry, homie, two hostages
are better than one.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.143
Remember that
boy I let go?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.280
And you broke your
promise, Cortez.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.882
Let me talk to him.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.884
Do not tell him
who you are.
Hey!

20:19.018 --> 20:21.087
Angel, I think I can help you.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.922
My name's Michael Plank.
Michael, don't...

20:22.989 --> 20:25.292
President of the
police commission.
I oversee the L.A.P.D.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.928
Thought he was
just a civilian.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.830
You're lying to me again.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.435
Hmm. Commissioner, huh?

20:35.502 --> 20:37.670
I got a gun to your head, and
you want to be my friend now?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.672
If you surrender, I assure you

20:39.739 --> 20:42.475
the L.A.P.D.
will do everything it can
to help your sister.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.143
And when you go
before a judge for sentencing,

20:44.210 --> 20:47.280
I'll tell them how
your actions were made
under extreme duress.

20:47.347 --> 20:51.684
You think any sentence,
or my life, means anything
if my sister's dead?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.854
You ever had
anybody you love die?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.924
Yes, I have.

20:59.492 --> 21:03.162
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Get up!
Get over there.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.999
You know I got
two big fish in here!

21:07.066 --> 21:08.801
You find my sister,
or they're dead!

21:12.705 --> 21:15.007
Lucero knows he has high-value
hostages in that cage.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.376
Tell me you got something.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.278
Okay, so he has a sister,
Abigail Lucero.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.881
She's 23, studies law
at Cal Northridge.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.518
She is not on scholarship,
and she doesn't have
much money.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.388
So it makes me think Lucero
might be paying her tuition.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.890
We had a patrol unit go by
and check her apartment.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.593
Her lock was broken,
place was trashed,
no sign of her.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.028
You're telling me no one
else filed a missing persons
report?

21:36.095 --> 21:37.464
We called the mother
a dozen times.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.332
She's not answering the phone.
None of it looks good.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.000
Los Reyes' soldiers
have been known to kidnap

21:41.067 --> 21:42.369
the loved ones
of their rivals,

21:42.435 --> 21:44.236
and they don't usually
return them alive.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.739
So, these were found
in Lopez's jacket.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.708
They're blueprints
to Figueroa Safety Inc.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.210
It's a private safety deposit
box company downtown.

21:51.277 --> 21:54.213
Specific instructions
to hit box number 39.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.916
You get anything off
of Lucero's cell phone?

21:56.983 --> 21:58.718
All he had was a burner.
No calls to track.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.420
I guess Los Reyes were gonna
call him at the deadline

22:00.487 --> 22:01.754
and tell him where to meet
with the box.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.156
So his story checks out.

22:04.223 --> 22:06.025
Crime techs get anything
out of Lopez's Caddy?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.727
It was just towed
into impound.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.496
They say they still need to do
their evidence report.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.197
Lucero has Cortez
in that gun cage,

22:11.263 --> 22:12.799
counting down the minutes
until 2:00 a.m.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.200
You two, get down
to that garage

22:14.266 --> 22:16.035
and see if you can find
anything useful in that car.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.203
Go.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.805
Before this building
housed S.W.A.T.,

22:18.871 --> 22:20.373
it was a Department
of Water and Power plant.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.642
Now, each one of these walls
is constructed

22:22.709 --> 22:24.577
of two-foot-thick
reinforced concrete,
including the armory.

22:24.644 --> 22:25.878
It's impenetrable.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.213
That's supposed to be
a good thing.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.581
Right now it's working
against us.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.517
Now, if we can't blow or drill
our way through these walls,

22:30.583 --> 22:32.118
we got to find a way to
reverse the emergency lock

22:32.184 --> 22:33.986
on that cage door
and force it open.
Yeah.

22:40.993 --> 22:45.732
Hey, so, uh,
has a suspect ever taken over
S.W.A.T. HQ like this before?

22:45.798 --> 22:48.300
Never. That's why Hicks called
in the Angel of Death.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.937
What's his deal again?
Best sniper to ever
join S.W.A.T.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.072
At least a hundred notches
on his belt.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.775
That many kills, though,
I hear the guy started
getting real quiet.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.677
He cashed in
his pension early.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.245
No one knows why but Hicks.

22:59.311 --> 23:02.148
One thing I do know
is, he doesn't miss.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.026
Hondo did say anything.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.166
Thanks for getting here
so fast.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.134
Suspect's in the armory.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.336
He's taken two
of our own as hostages.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.874
The cage door is
a half-inch ballistic mesh.

23:29.909 --> 23:30.910
I see you finally quit.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.015
Uh, just make
yourself at home.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.535
Angel, when they took
your sister,

23:55.602 --> 23:56.803
why didn't you
call the police?

23:56.869 --> 23:58.605
Where I come from,

23:58.671 --> 24:00.039
you learn to be
your own police.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.341
Angel, you're smart enough
to know that if you kill us,

24:02.408 --> 24:04.677
those men out there
are gonna kill you.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.479
And all of this is gonna be
for nothing.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.114
I don't care what
happens to me.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.550
But if Abby dies...

24:12.552 --> 24:15.154
I'm gonna lay down
a load of misery
no one will ever forget.

24:19.391 --> 24:23.696
Steel mesh is gonna change
the trajectory of the shot.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.998
Can't promise a bull's-eye.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.168
Better chances than
he'll give them.

24:29.235 --> 24:33.472
Sir... Lucero,
he's telling the truth.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.474
Well, we don't have time
to sort out the truth.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.109
Right now I want him
out of my armory.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.745
Sergeant, I advise you
take a position.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.928
You shouldn't stand there.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.396
What the hell is Cortez doing?

24:57.463 --> 24:59.265
She doesn't want us
to take him out.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.600
There's got
to be a reason.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.268
No more tricks.
Angel, trust me.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.671
They must have a big gun,

25:04.737 --> 25:07.674
and they will kill you
before we get a chance
to save your sister.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.383
Sir,

25:17.449 --> 25:19.385
finding Lucero's sister
might just be our best play.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.454
Why not let them kill me?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.923
When you had
that family hostage,

25:23.990 --> 25:25.391
it didn't matter
what you said.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.993
My job was to protect them.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.561
But now I believe you.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.030
And it's also my job
to protect your sister.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.104
She's running out of time.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.774
Let me talk to Hondo.
He's my best sergeant.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.442
If it was my
sister missing,

25:43.509 --> 25:44.877
he'd be the man
I send to find her.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.079
Okay, but no guns.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.316
Hondo, you can approach.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.651
Unarmed.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.768
Captain, Commissioner,
are you okay?

26:08.835 --> 26:10.569
We're good, Hondo.

26:10.637 --> 26:14.273
But this man...
You need to find his sister.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.374
Hondo, I believe him.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.278
Angel, listen to me.

26:19.345 --> 26:22.048
If you let these two go,
I give you my word
we'll find Abby.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.983
I already got burned
once today
releasing a hostage.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.818
I'm not gonna do it again.

26:25.885 --> 26:29.388
If you're as good as she says
you are, go find me my sister.
Okay, okay.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.657
Do you have any idea

26:30.723 --> 26:32.358
where Los Reyes
might be holding her?
No.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.129
Go find my mom.
Maybe she knows something.

26:37.196 --> 26:40.166
Abby goes by her house
every morning for breakfast.
Okay.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.834
Angel, we're gonna find her,
you hear me?

26:43.235 --> 26:44.603
I just need you
to keep your cool.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.427
HONDO: Street.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.065
Give me two! Give me two!

27:13.132 --> 27:14.667
LUCA: Two! Two! Two!

27:16.035 --> 27:17.970
LUCA: Right side clear!
HONDO: Left side clear!

27:18.037 --> 27:19.138
CHRIS:
Give me two!

27:19.205 --> 27:20.306
HONDO: Hondo out!
LUCA: Luca out!

27:22.341 --> 27:23.910
CHRIS: Right side clear!
STREET: Left side clear!

27:23.976 --> 27:25.611
HONDO: Two! Two!

27:25.678 --> 27:27.213
LUCA: All right.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.252
Now we know why Mom wasn't
answering her phone.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.767
Left side clear.
Right side clear!

27:47.834 --> 27:49.235
HONDO: Luca.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.114
It's okay.
We're Metro S.W.A.T.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.116
You're safe now, ma'am.
You're safe.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.617
It's okay.
It's okay.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.488
My... My little girl.
They took her.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.423
Do you know who took
your daughter?
Los Reyes.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.626
They walked in with guns
and grabbed her
right from my table.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.228
I tried to fight them, but...

28:16.295 --> 28:17.563
Your son, he sent us.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.199
Angel?
Yeah.

28:20.266 --> 28:23.635
I knew it was because of him.
What trouble is he in now?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.405
It's pretty bad, ma'am.
Before he gets anyone killed,

28:26.472 --> 28:28.407
we need you to talk
some sense into him.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.508
Can you do that for us?

28:40.319 --> 28:43.155
Hey. We didn't forget
about you.
Oh.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.891
My wife has packed my lunch
every day for ten years.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.259
Today's BLT day, except
she uses turkey bacon.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.595
I kind of miss
the real stuff.
Thanks, I was starving.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.197
Ah, it's really coming
along, I'm impressed.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.666
All the parts you gave me

28:54.733 --> 28:58.237
actually allowed me
to make some improvements
to the old one.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.272
Why exactly
are you helping me?

29:00.339 --> 29:02.474
Standing in your dining room
that we destroyed,

29:02.541 --> 29:03.843
seeing how much
this meant to you...

29:03.910 --> 29:05.978
Well, you missing a chance
at a scholarship

29:06.045 --> 29:08.047
was a casualty
I couldn't accept.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.282
HONDO:  Deac,
where are we at with getting
that cage door open?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.985
Uh, we're close, Hondo.
Tan's drilling open the
electrical panels now.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.553
Okay, I got the mother.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.355
We're almost there.
Be ready for us.
Roger that.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.890
Here. I don't want to take
your whole sandwich.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.158
No, no, no. No,
you finish it.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.828
On this job,
I've learned to live
off protein bars.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.696
Hey, when I come back, this
hawk better be ready to fly.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.065
Yes, sir.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.636
You swiped right
on Jolly Molly.
CHRIS: Okay...

29:30.702 --> 29:32.338
This girl looks like
a total nightmare.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.306
You got to get past
their pics and actually
read their profiles.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.108
Okay.
She likes brunch.
Mmm-hmm.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.543
Brunch. Wow.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.046
Just like every other girl
in L.A.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.647
She's a nurse
at a children's hospital.

29:41.713 --> 29:42.882
Nurses like taking
care of people,

29:42.949 --> 29:44.183
and God knows you need
taking care of.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.185
And she's into motorcycles.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.453
She's probably got
a weekend Harley

29:47.519 --> 29:49.155
she cruises on
below the speed limit.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.223
I'm telling her that when she
gets off her graveyard shift,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.993
you're going to take her
on a coffee date.
Coffee date.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.929
That's where a girl gets to
know you without you plying
her with booze and trying

29:56.996 --> 29:58.330
to stick your tongue
down her throat.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.966
LUCA:
Almost to HQ.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.674
Your hero better
find my sister.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.076
I don't want to have
to kill both of you.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.945
If you're gonna
kill anyone, kill me.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.614
HONDO:
Angel.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.748
I got your mother here.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.318
She wants to talk
to you, man.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.320
Mama, what'd they do to you?

30:21.387 --> 30:22.554
Angel,
what are you doing?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.056
Whatever it takes
to get Abby back.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.192
You think this
is the best way?

30:26.258 --> 30:29.195
You know, when you were born,
all you did was laugh,

30:29.261 --> 30:31.263
and you just
wanted to be held.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.699
There was something so sweet
about you.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.567
Mama, where's Abby?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.036
Where is she?
Take it easy!

30:37.103 --> 30:38.337
Take it easy!
MRS. LUCERO: Wait,

30:38.404 --> 30:40.706
when I found out your father
stole for a living,

30:40.772 --> 30:42.975
I took you and Abigail away
to protect you.

30:43.042 --> 30:47.446
I never understood. Why did
you follow in his footsteps?

30:47.513 --> 30:48.747
I know you hated me
for a long time,

30:48.814 --> 30:50.449
but I'm trying to
make it up to you.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.850
Can't you see that?

31:05.364 --> 31:07.133
If you would have came
to visit me in prison,

31:07.199 --> 31:09.969
you would have known
that I changed.
But you never did.

31:10.036 --> 31:13.139
Even when I was using
every dollar I made
to pay for Abby's college.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.840
Blood money.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.910
I wish, if you would
walk out of there alive,

31:17.977 --> 31:19.311
that I could love you again.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.613
But I can't.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.551
Los Reyes took
my little girl.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.819
And there's no one
to blame but you.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.058
You want to kill him?

31:36.628 --> 31:37.729
Go ahead.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.008
Mama! I'm sorry!

31:50.242 --> 31:52.244
Come on. Come on.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.315
Our little mother-son reunion
just made things worse.

31:56.382 --> 31:57.816
You got anything
else on his sister?

31:57.883 --> 31:59.885
Found this bag in the trunk
of Manuel Lopez's Caddy.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.688
Before Carlos killed him,
not only was he
a Los Reyes assassin,

32:02.754 --> 32:04.656
but a gym rat
who actually used
his membership.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.658
This GPS exercise watch
was inside.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.527
He never turned it off.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.263
So we hacked into his account,
tracked his every move
for the last 24 hours.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.234
2:30 a.m. Valentine's
After Hours strip club.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.369
5:25 a.m. Estrella's Tacos.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.871
10:08 a.m. Lopez was
at Anna Lucero's house.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.241
So Lucero was right.
Lopez helped snatch
his sister.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.644
Then at 10:56 a.m., he stopped
at a carniceria on Alvarado.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.180
Which happens to be
on our narcotics watch list
as one of Los Reyes' fronts.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.082
That's a butcher shop.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.818
There's a rumor on the street
that that's how Los Reyes
disposes of bodies.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.486
We're losing time.
Let's roll.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.625
BARRIOS: Your hermano,
I really thought he would
come through.

32:40.592 --> 32:43.529
Box 39.
You know what's inside?

32:44.696 --> 32:47.266
$4 million, cash.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.904
Me and my brother,
we did a deal
with the Armenians,

32:54.440 --> 32:57.476
but had to sit on the money
till things cooled down.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.479
My brother put it
in a private deposit box.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.381
Said it would be safe.

33:02.448 --> 33:06.185
Three months ago,
my brother was stabbed
to death in a bar fight.

33:06.252 --> 33:11.090
Now my money's stuck
in this box and no one
knows where the key is.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.195
You won't be alone,
beautiful.

33:16.262 --> 33:20.132
After we kill you,
we're gonna find your brother

33:20.199 --> 33:21.833
and bury his body parts
with you.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.669
Mmm.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.979
Metro S.W.A.T.!
Get on the ground!
CHRIS: L.A.P.D.! Weapons down!

33:34.046 --> 33:36.082
L.A.P.D.! Get on the ground!
L.A.P.D.! Weapons down!

33:36.148 --> 33:37.849
Metro S.W.A.T.!
Down on the ground!
On the ground!

33:37.916 --> 33:39.551
STREET: Down on the ground!
LUCA: On the ground now!

33:39.618 --> 33:42.054
Give me your hands!
Javier, you feel like
a king now?

33:44.823 --> 33:47.159
Cut the yellow one.
Are you sure?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.695
Yeah, yellow. That'll
send a reverse surge
to the cage door,

33:49.761 --> 33:51.630
overriding
the emergency lock.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.532
Commander, we're
ready when you are.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.305
Angel,
I know they're out there
looking for your sister.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.472
Was this your plan all along?

34:00.539 --> 34:01.607
To wait me out?
No.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.175
I'm done waiting.
Angel, Angel.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.481
Deacon, cut it now.
Roger that. Go.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.025
Now!
Fire!

34:42.281 --> 34:43.515
Get him out of here.

34:43.582 --> 34:44.916
Jessica,
are you okay?
I'm good.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.224
Move!

34:55.694 --> 34:56.862
CORTEZ: Angel, don't do this.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.864
Mama was right.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.066
This is my fault.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.402
HONDO: Angel.

35:05.871 --> 35:09.608
Angel, I got someone
you want to see.

35:11.009 --> 35:12.578
ABIGAIL: Angel.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.213
They saved me.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.648
They said it was
because of you.
Abby.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.284
Please, just do what they say.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.319
I love you.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.355
HONDO: Angel.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.123
We got her back
like I said we would.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.026
Now you got to do me a solid.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.496
Hand that thing over.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.402
Come on, it's done.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.891
I'm getting blood
all over you.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.261
It's okay.
It's okay.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.677
We even now?

36:19.345 --> 36:21.012
Yeah.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.282
Let's hope we don't have to
see each other any time soon.

36:29.255 --> 36:33.959
Cortez, you held
tough in there.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.563
I'm just glad it was you out
there giving the orders, sir.

36:37.629 --> 36:41.066
When you stepped
in front of that shot,
I wanted to strangle you.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.569
I believed his sister
needed our help.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.805
What I said earlier
about the reporter,

36:46.872 --> 36:48.574
I didn't mean
to be such a prick.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.142
I know you're just
looking out for me.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.978
And I will never
forget you were the one

36:53.044 --> 36:54.280
who gave me
a shot at S.W.A.T.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.048
Okay, then.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.924
Hey. How you feeling?

37:05.991 --> 37:07.759
Thanks for getting me
out of there in one piece.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.232
When Lucero asked if you
knew what it felt like

37:14.300 --> 37:16.268
to have someone
you love die,

37:16.335 --> 37:18.737
you said yes.
Were you lying?

37:23.342 --> 37:24.510
In college,

37:24.576 --> 37:27.413
I fell in love
with a girl, Brooklyn.

37:28.980 --> 37:33.419
She was beautiful
and amazing.

37:33.485 --> 37:37.122
She came from a poor family.
She was there
on a scholarship.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.925
I came from money,
so we couldn't have
been more different.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.194
Eventually asked her
to marry me.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.531
What happened?

37:47.232 --> 37:48.734
She had a stalker.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.639
He would follow her
to classes,

37:53.705 --> 37:55.441
showed up at her waitress job,

37:56.642 --> 37:58.176
leave notes
on her car.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.415
Brooklyn filed reports,
but the cops said
it was a "college crush."

38:05.651 --> 38:07.919
Then, one night,

38:07.986 --> 38:09.921
he got into her apartment.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.826
He waited for me to leave,

38:14.893 --> 38:16.795
and then when she got
in the shower...

38:19.264 --> 38:21.367
I should've never
left her alone.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.934
Michael, I'm so sorry.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.840
When the opportunity
came for me to be in the
police commission, I took it.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.912
To help people
that the police dismiss

38:35.381 --> 38:36.848
and to honor Brooklyn.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.017
She'd be very proud.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.906
CHRIS: Molly? Hey.
Hey.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.074
Street will be
right out. Chris.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.110
I just wanted
to meet you first.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.745
Are you his sister?
No.

39:06.812 --> 39:07.979
Please tell me
you're not his ex.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.247
I don't need
the competition.
No.

39:09.314 --> 39:10.782
I'm just his friend
and his coworker.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.217
I just wanted
to tell you that

39:12.283 --> 39:13.719
you're about to meet
a really good guy

39:13.785 --> 39:15.286
who doesn't realize
how good he is yet.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.824
Between us girls,
I've seen him before
on that site,

39:18.890 --> 39:20.392
but those
shirtless pics...

39:21.660 --> 39:22.794
I couldn't do it.
Yeah.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.063
But his new profile's
really sweet.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.264
Is this the new V4?

39:26.832 --> 39:28.567
How...

39:28.634 --> 39:31.369
Isn't there, like,
a wait list for...
For this model?

39:31.437 --> 39:33.639
I slipped my guy at the
dealership an extra grand

39:33.705 --> 39:36.241
to put me at the top.
Molly Simpson.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.076
Hi. Jim Street.
Hi.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.645
And that is awesome.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.313
Doesn't look like
a weekend Harley.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.618
I guess you met my extremely
nosy and bossy partner Chris.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.219
She seems to be
looking out for you.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.456
Have fun.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.958
So, uh, coffee?

39:53.024 --> 39:54.192
Yes.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.694
Now, there's Corner Bakery,
it's on Fig and Eighth.

39:55.761 --> 39:56.962
I know it.
Yeah?

39:57.028 --> 39:58.830
Last one there pays?
Hope you brought cash.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.098
Oh, all right.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.816
Hey, kid.
How's Medic

40:17.883 --> 40:19.751
Not pretty,

40:19.818 --> 40:21.019
but she works.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.854
Still lacking a component
I always wanted, though.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.190
Um, a camera to send video
back to the operator.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.758
I just could never
afford the hardware.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.765
Don't mind Luca.
He tends to get excited,
wander off.

40:33.832 --> 40:34.833
He's kind of like
a dog that way.

40:37.135 --> 40:40.305
Yesterday, me and my parents
had a gun to our heads.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.274
I never thanked you
for saving us.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.844
You just did.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.212
LUCA: Hey.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.081
Does this work? It's hi-res
with Wi-Fi capabilities.

40:50.148 --> 40:53.151
Wow, I must've just
missed it in the boxes.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.753
You rip off someone's dashcam?

40:54.820 --> 40:57.523
No way. I'd never go through
Mumford's equipment locker
for spare parts.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.925
Hey, blackout's lifted.

40:59.991 --> 41:01.527
Call your folks,
let 'em know you're okay.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.564
7:30? Check-in for the
contest ends at 8:00.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.998
I'm never gonna
make it on time.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.601
Luca, what do you think?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.810
Hey.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.882
I was gonna
go get this encased
in Lucite for you.

41:23.949 --> 41:26.251
Kind of like a collector's
baseball, only it's a, uh...
Grenade.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.786
Right.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.288
I knew you'd find her.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.057
You kept him talking.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.392
And he never knew it,
but you were always
the one in control.

41:34.459 --> 41:37.095
I'm not sure about that,
but thanks.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.131
I think we could both use
a drink right about now,
but it's way past happy hour.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.402
But you know, all of this,

41:44.469 --> 41:46.738
it made me want to reach out
to my mother and my sister.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.574
I think I might take 'em
out to lunch or something.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.208
It's been way too long
since I've seen 'em anyway.

41:50.909 --> 41:51.977
That's a good idea.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.513
Jess, I was really worried
about you.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.918
JULIAN: It works!

41:59.985 --> 42:01.787
Hear that? We got eyes.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.755
Yo, hold up,
what is going on?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.223
CHRIS: I don't know.
No one's told me yet.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.558
We're hitting
a science contest.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.927
Love to chat, Hondo,
but Julian's got us
on a deadline.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.161
Hey, Julian.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.529
Good luck, kid.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.778
LUCA: Step aside.
Hey, step aside.

42:26.845 --> 42:28.113
DEACON: Excuse us.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.648
Sixty seconds until
check-in ends.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.617
Step aside, you guys,
we got a winner
coming through.

42:31.683 --> 42:32.951
Get that door open.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.422
Damn. Should've
thought of that.
