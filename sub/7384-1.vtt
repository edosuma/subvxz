But I will say this.

When I want something, no one
can stop me from taking it.

02:21.726 --> 02:24.646
I'm not too concerned. I've won
more battles than I've lost.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.607
I feel bad for Weyland,
I really do.

But Father Time, he's
caught up with the old man.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.861

02:50.421 --> 02:52.131
Wasn't so bad, was it?

02:57.929 --> 02:59.347
I built this business.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.432
I didn't have to steal it.

03:01.933 --> 03:04.519
What you left vulnerable,
I seized. I stole nothing.

03:04.602 --> 03:08.231
You lacked vision, Weyland.
That was your undoing.

Vision.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.740
(DOOR SHUTS)

03:18.366 --> 03:22.704
Is that why you're investing millions in
dilapidated prisons all around the globe?

Vision?

03:25.289 --> 03:28.543
You're so far over your head, you might
as well be six feet under the ground.

03:28.626 --> 03:32.046
The prison business is not what
made this company profitable.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.590
So the conclusion to draw,

03:37.844 --> 03:39.846
you're trying to
franchise <i>Death Race.</i>

03:42.807 --> 03:45.143
(CHUCKLES)
It's not going to work.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.061
Because you couldn't
make it work.

03:47.812 --> 03:50.815
Let me show you what true
vision really looks like.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.827
You started something
beautiful, Weyland.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
But you only scratched
at the surface.

04:04.996 --> 04:07.707

taking Death Race global.</i>

04:07.832 --> 04:10.960

different drivers, tracks and challenges.

04:15.339 --> 04:21.053
I will have a monopoly on the most profitable
sport in the history of the planet.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.639
More cars.
More cons. More guns.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.351

04:38.446 --> 04:39.739
Frankenstein.

04:40.698 --> 04:43.743
It's a man in a mask.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.995
I could have 20 Frankensteins
around the globe.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.955
How would the fans know
which one was real?

04:48.206 --> 04:50.583
Frankenstein won
his fourth race today.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.085
One more win, he goes free.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.755
That's a fact
that every fan knows.

04:56.631 --> 04:59.425
Now, if you suddenly change
the rules of the game,

05:00.092 --> 05:01.719
you're going to
lose your audience.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.972
And if you're hoping
that Frankenstein loses,

05:05.056 --> 05:07.600
well, son, I guess
there's a first time.

05:08.059 --> 05:11.479
Now, how would your
little copycat event play

05:11.562 --> 05:13.564
without the game's
marquee star?

05:14.065 --> 05:16.275
That's why you're
going to fail.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.531
What kind of cigars
you smoke, Weyland?

05:22.365 --> 05:26.160
I'll be sure to send you a box when
<i>Death Race</i> becomes a global success.

05:26.244 --> 05:30.665
It'll be the second time I've beaten you.
The second time you've lost.

05:31.916 --> 05:35.503
Well, you enjoy your
moment while you can.

05:37.255 --> 05:39.090
Payback's a bitch, son.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.476
NILES: Weyland's right.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.442
Find out who the man
behind the mask really is.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.647
What he loves, what he hates,
what he covets most.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.023
And find out what Weyland
was planning next.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.191
What do you mean?

05:57.275 --> 05:59.151
The company's banking nearly
eight million quid a week

05:59.235 --> 06:00.862
hawking Frankenstein
merchandise.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.185
He wasn't just gonna let it go.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.322
Anything else?

06:03.739 --> 06:07.159
Yeah. Get yourself some decent clothes.
You look like a bag lady.

06:07.952 --> 06:12.874
I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have clone all
this unless I absolutely loved Death Race.

Fear not.
I am like you.

I seek not to destroy nor to compromise
what we've all come to revere.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.969
The <i>Death Race</i> that we all
know and love will not change.

06:25.052 --> 06:29.557
It will grow bigger and better.

face and I gave you a way out.

were gonna keep your word.

kindness of your heart, did you?

07:47.259 --> 07:49.637

No.

It's perfect.

Very generous.
Thank you.

Well, things change, huh?

Personally, I think
I did better than that.

Are you complaining?
Hell, no.
