Hi, Candace Wilkes.

not understanding you.

Doesn't always have his running
shoes.

aggressive with a lot of the

misunderstanding.

-Of course he's going to deny.
That's probably what I would do
if I was a kid.

01:47.583 --> 01:49.834
-Are you calling my Zachary a
liar?

01:49.875 --> 01:52.417
-Well, I'm calling him
disruptive, and if he's
denying that,

01:52.458 --> 01:54.625
then I guess we can also
say he's a liar.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.834
-There's definitely a liar in
the room.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.458
But it's not my Zachary.
-Oh! Then are you the liar?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.625
-I'm not a liar. I'm calling
you a liar.

-My Zachary's an angel.

02:03.834 --> 02:06.500

a more suitable mark?

And not let this be a permanent
stain on Zach's report card.

02:12.291 --> 02:16.500
-Well, how about we just agree
that the mark's gonna stay the
same for now.

02:16.542 --> 02:19.375
And if he improves his
attitude...

02:19.417 --> 02:23.375

remembers to bring his
uniform...

-Maybe the school's on fire
and we'll get off early today.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.500
-Ohh! That'd be cool.
You know what it is?

20:39.542 --> 20:42.125
It's probably some over
protective parent calling
the National Guard

20:42.166 --> 20:44.458
because their kid touched
some gluten.
-[Sound of fire extinguisher]

20:44.500 --> 20:47.500
-That would not surprise me,
with gluten these days.
-[Bobbi]: Gerry!

20:47.542 --> 20:49.500
-Yeah.
-Everybody's terrified.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.458
-Watch out for gluten,
gluten, gluten, gluten.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.709
-I don't even know what it is.
It makes food taste...
-Guys!

20:53.750 --> 20:57.333
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-When you're on duty you
have to watch the kids.

20:57.375 --> 21:01.166
-We are watching the kids.
The kids' got a helmut on.
-We're watching the kids.
