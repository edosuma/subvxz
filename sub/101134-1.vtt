- Dad?

00:12.412 --> 00:14.212
- Yes, Carlton?

00:14.289 --> 00:15.567
- There's something
I gotta know,

00:15.591 --> 00:17.268
and I don't want you
to spare my feelings.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.426
I can handle the truth.

00:19.503 --> 00:21.386
- Okay, son.
You have my word.

00:21.463 --> 00:23.680
What's on your mind?

00:23.757 --> 00:27.401
- When I grow up, will I be
able to grow a beard like that?

00:29.304 --> 00:32.281
- You're a Lassiter,
and Lassiter men have been

00:32.357 --> 00:35.400
growing legendary face wigs
for generations.

00:35.477 --> 00:37.736
It's a king's beard
born in your blood,

00:37.813 --> 00:39.571
perfected through centuries.

00:39.648 --> 00:43.075
But never forget, it's not
the beard that makes the king.

00:43.151 --> 00:45.505
- I know, I know.
It's the queen.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.579
- That's right, son.

Meet Morrissey the rescue dog,

02:24.586 --> 02:26.645
here to rescue you
from your own handsomeness.

02:26.722 --> 02:28.608
- That dog's Chief Vick's.
- He was.

02:28.632 --> 02:29.964
- He kept biting her daughter.

02:30.042 --> 02:31.527
- Affection gnawing
is what the vet called it.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.851
- He called it rabies, Shawn.

02:32.928 --> 02:34.488
- Either way, the Chief, Gus,
and I have come

02:34.512 --> 02:35.645
to a little agreement.

02:35.722 --> 02:36.655
- She set him loose in my office

02:36.732 --> 02:37.992
and sped away in her car.

02:38.016 --> 02:39.511
- Then you called us to come
down here

02:39.535 --> 02:41.304
and the whole thing just felt
like a win-win.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.455
- That dog is eating my foot.

02:42.479 --> 02:43.539
- Morrissey!
- Stop it.

02:43.563 --> 02:44.516
- Psst.
- Stop it.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.917
- Fsst.
- Stop it.

02:45.941 --> 02:47.293
- Excuse me, Carlton,
I didn't realize

02:47.317 --> 02:48.834
you had visitors.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.548
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry, no pets.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.331
- Pets?
I'm sorry, I...

02:54.407 --> 02:55.540
[whines]

02:55.617 --> 02:57.876
Oh!
That's Morrissey.

02:57.953 --> 02:59.669
He's a therapy dog.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.379
- Does he have a vest?

03:01.456 --> 03:04.007
- He does, though, he prefers
to call it a "waistcoat."

03:04.084 --> 03:06.384
I think you'll find it all
checks out.

03:06.461 --> 03:07.552
- Hmm.

03:07.629 --> 03:08.962
This an old Theraflu T-shirt

03:09.039 --> 03:12.432
with tape over the "flu"
and "py" in Sharpie.

03:12.509 --> 03:13.683
- You're good.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.645
One point for you, Dolores.
[chuckles]

03:16.721 --> 03:18.063
My name is Shawn Spencer

03:18.140 --> 03:19.667

Bill Poopingtons.

03:19.691 --> 03:20.826
- No.
Shawn?

03:20.850 --> 03:21.775
- What?
- Sidebar.

03:21.851 --> 03:23.318
- All right.

03:23.395 --> 03:24.413
- Carlton, what is happening
right now?

03:24.437 --> 03:26.031
- Let it go.
- Yes.

03:26.055 --> 03:28.226
- Bill Poopingtons.
What kind of nickname is that?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.710
- Transylvania Dutch.
Why?

03:29.734 --> 03:30.742
- No, Shawn.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.327
No more embarrassing nicknames,

03:32.404 --> 03:33.631
especially in front
of peers and professionals.

03:33.655 --> 03:34.766
- Gus, don't be the night

03:34.790 --> 03:36.384
your dad fell asleep
inside your mom.

03:36.408 --> 03:37.707

03:37.784 --> 03:39.259
we've been doing for ten years.

03:39.336 --> 03:40.554
We have fans;
they have expectations.

03:40.578 --> 03:41.987
There'll be a huge backlash.

03:42.064 --> 03:43.808
- Shawn, we are two dumbasses.
We do not have fans.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.017
- [clicks tongue]

03:45.041 --> 03:46.424
- From now on,
I do the nicknames.

03:46.501 --> 03:47.645
- No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

03:47.669 --> 03:48.969
That's disgusting.

03:49.045 --> 03:51.680
Counterproposal:
you have right of refusal

03:51.756 --> 03:53.932

- It's a Band-Aid,
but okay for now.

03:57.637 --> 03:58.937
- I'm terribly sorry, Dolores.

03:59.014 --> 04:01.022
What I meant to say was,
my name is Shawn Spencer

04:01.099 --> 04:04.763
and this is my full-fledged
partner All-The-Pips-In-One.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.487
- Accepted.
Hello.

04:07.564 --> 04:09.750
- Could you fellas take
a little walk with me?

04:09.774 --> 04:10.927
[clicks tongue]
- Hmm.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.451
Lassie, is that
what I think it is?

04:13.528 --> 04:15.412
[laughs]

04:15.488 --> 04:18.009
- Guys, I love animals,
but I'm sure you know

04:18.033 --> 04:19.760
what a prestigious place
the Herschel House is.

04:19.784 --> 04:22.502
- We do, but let me just say,
although the dog

04:22.579 --> 04:25.389
is not fully certified and ate
one of the two gas pedals

04:25.465 --> 04:26.684
in our car
on the way down here...

04:26.708 --> 04:28.008
- Two what?

04:28.084 --> 04:29.724
- We had hoped that
this visit alone would

04:29.794 --> 04:30.997
start to help Carlton heal
his tangled memories.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.041
He's a tough man
with the thick skin

04:33.065 --> 04:34.681
of a northern white rhino,

04:34.758 --> 04:37.767
but the heart of a smaller,
less-white rhino.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.956
- I know, and you're right,
um...

04:39.980 --> 04:42.605
- It's Burton, but you can call
me Jermajesty

04:42.682 --> 04:45.108
or whatever you'd like, Dolores.

04:45.185 --> 04:48.361
- Well, Jermajesty,
I am gonna kick myself

04:48.438 --> 04:50.624
for falling prey
to a dapper, smooth-talking,

04:50.648 --> 04:52.877
devil's food cookie
with a perfect cranium,

04:52.901 --> 04:55.794
but I'll make the exception.

04:57.447 --> 04:58.758
- "Dapper" and "smooth-talking,"

04:58.782 --> 05:00.373
that doesn't sound right.

05:00.450 --> 05:02.042
- Mr. Wilkerson, beautiful day.

05:02.118 --> 05:05.337
Okay, dog stays, but he's on
a very short leash.

05:05.413 --> 05:09.132
Short leash.
[laughs]

05:09.209 --> 05:11.760
And, in exchange,
you guys can tell me why

05:11.836 --> 05:13.081
you're really here.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.774
- Damn, she's good.
- Yeah.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.609
- All right, Lassie called us
last night.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.141
He's seeing things.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.904
- Ghosts.
- Not necessarily ghosts.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.144
- But probably ghosts.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.406
- But there's a lot
of strange stuff

05:22.430 --> 05:23.710
going on around here:

05:23.774 --> 05:25.534
eerie voices in pipes,
bodies being dragged

05:25.558 --> 05:27.536
out into the woods at night,
black Jell-O.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.847
- We're checking to see
if this joint was built

05:28.871 --> 05:30.070
on an Indian burial ground.

05:30.146 --> 05:31.916
- Uh, it was built
on an old Kmart,

05:31.940 --> 05:34.085
and he's never mentioned
a word of this to me.

05:34.109 --> 05:35.729
- That's because he doesn't
want anyone to know.

05:35.753 --> 05:36.960
We've sworn silence.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.578
Shawn can't tell his wife.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.016
My girlfriend thinks
I'm working a double shift.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.443
I can't even take her calls.

05:41.467 --> 05:42.769
- Well, you can't take
her calls,

05:42.793 --> 05:44.069
because you downloaded
a rogue app

05:44.093 --> 05:45.137
that changes all of your emojis

05:45.161 --> 05:46.364
into little Jamaicans.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.347
Seventeen viruses.
- I see.

05:48.423 --> 05:49.975
So you have a girlfriend?
- I do.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.936
- Dolores, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.105
I only said "black Jell-O"
because that was Gus' nickname

05:54.129 --> 05:55.409
in our adult dodgeball league.

05:55.463 --> 05:56.846
- Mm.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.377
- And Lassie's terrified
that he's going crazy.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.171
Anyone finds out,
it could cost him his job,

06:01.195 --> 06:03.614
his dignity,
maybe even his family.

06:03.638 --> 06:05.658
- Carlton doesn't even remember
why he went

06:05.682 --> 06:07.407
to that abandoned building.

06:07.484 --> 06:09.620
His only recollection
of his shooter is a silhouette,

06:09.644 --> 06:11.205
he's on nine different
medications,

06:11.229 --> 06:12.790
and as you both know,
he suffered a massive stroke

06:12.814 --> 06:13.975
during surgery.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.927
So of course he's seeing things,

06:15.951 --> 06:17.795
but feeding into these fantasies

06:17.819 --> 06:20.578
is the least helpful thing
you can do right now, okay?

06:20.655 --> 06:23.039
Now, I know this goofy
little white guy,

06:23.116 --> 06:25.261
sexy black dude routine
the two of you have going

06:25.285 --> 06:26.988
like the back of my scrubs.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.545
But you really wanna help?

06:28.621 --> 06:30.847
Just be the grown men
that you are.

06:34.169 --> 06:35.769
- Okay, what is going on here?

06:35.846 --> 06:37.126
- What, Dolores?

06:37.172 --> 06:38.555
- The nurse from
"Color of Night"

06:38.631 --> 06:39.898
fawning all over you.

06:39.975 --> 06:41.628
- I don't know,
maybe she's attractive,

06:41.652 --> 06:43.654
but, Shawn, I'm with Selene now.

06:43.678 --> 06:44.905
I can't keep track
of every shorty

06:44.929 --> 06:45.854
that wants what they can't have.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.198
[chuckles]

06:51.686 --> 06:53.131
- Where the hell have
you two been?

06:53.155 --> 06:54.571
- Sorry, Lassie.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.000
We were on our way up the stairs

06:56.024 --> 06:57.501
when Gus spotted a Jamba
right across the street.

06:57.525 --> 06:59.020
We made it happen.
Where's the dog?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.376
- He jumped out the window

07:00.454 --> 07:02.006
the second you walked out
the door,

07:02.030 --> 07:03.632
took my Jell-O, and ran
straight into the woods.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.081
- That makes sense.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.927
He is a hunter-gatherer
of the highest order.

07:06.951 --> 07:08.679
- That wasn't the last Jell-O,
though, was it?

07:08.703 --> 07:10.055
- Doesn't matter.
We don't need the dog.

07:10.079 --> 07:12.180
- Lassie, I'm gonna cut
to the chase.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.278
It's gonna be
a hard pass for us.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.686
We simply cannot keep lying
to our ladies

07:17.762 --> 07:20.180
to cover up your spooky
ghost sightings, okay?

07:20.256 --> 07:22.557
It's too hard.
They know each other.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.642
We're grown men with real pubes.

07:24.719 --> 07:26.144
Let me give you a visual.

07:26.221 --> 07:28.073
You remember Eddie Murphy's
mustache in "Raw"?

07:28.097 --> 07:30.034
Well, that's what Gus has
going on right over the twig.

07:30.058 --> 07:33.818
Now look, whatever you think
you're seeing, it's up here.

07:33.895 --> 07:36.654
You've been through a lot
and hospitals are creepy,

07:36.731 --> 07:38.198
even super luxurious ones.

07:38.274 --> 07:40.033
Trust me on this, man.

07:40.109 --> 07:43.203
You're just really high.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.691
- High.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.757
[door creaking]

07:49.044 --> 07:52.012
<i>[eerie music]</i>

07:53.748 --> 07:55.798
Uh, Shawn.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.100
What's in that dog's mouth?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.519
- Gus, please.

08:00.922 --> 08:02.783
It is nothing more
than a human hand.

08:02.807 --> 08:06.017
Oh, my God!
It's... it's a human hand.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.987
And it's covered
in leaves and moss

08:09.064 --> 08:11.898
and it's human and it is a hand.

08:11.975 --> 08:14.651
I'm gonna have to call my wife.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.819
I'm gonna have to lie again.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.197
Lassie, we're in.

08:19.274 --> 08:20.626
- Of course you're in,
you morons.

You're a Lassiter.

something last night,

soaked in blood

25:20.919 --> 25:23.053
sneak into some stables
at a recovery house?

25:23.130 --> 25:26.098

- Did anybody else see this?

- Yes.

- A dog?

Morrissey ate Dolores.

We are.

25:38.228 --> 25:39.736

The hand that Morrissey found
belongs to

25:41.540 --> 25:43.624

took a dive into the river.

- Yeah, guess again.
- You'll never know.

25:56.371 --> 25:58.130
- Regardless, your only
witness is a dog,

25:58.206 --> 25:59.965

didn't eat a nurse.

26:00.042 --> 26:03.060

just check out the stables

I'm crazy.

That doesn't make any sense.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.588
that the areas marked
"restricted" are restricted,

28:44.664 --> 28:47.299

28:54.216 --> 28:55.568

28:55.592 --> 28:58.338

maybe headed that way?

28:58.362 --> 28:59.936
- No, no pools of blood.

29:00.013 --> 29:01.632
- Any people living
in your pipes?

29:01.656 --> 29:03.201
- Maybe speaking their own
tongue, perhaps Parsel.

29:03.225 --> 29:04.941
- I'm fairly certain we do not.

29:05.018 --> 29:06.579
- I feel like we're making
some serious strides here.

29:06.603 --> 29:08.028
- Yes.

29:08.104 --> 29:09.540
- What about

industrial accident,

100% of their appendages.

what is this about?

29:17.239 --> 29:18.580
- Say nothing.

29:18.657 --> 29:19.998
- Carlton may have seen
a zombie.

You are very good
at extracting confessions.

29:38.593 --> 29:39.985
- Impressive.

29:41.721 --> 29:45.023
- I know that the Chief
has been seeing things

29:45.100 --> 29:46.483
that are unexplainable.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.287
Believe me, we are doing
everything in our power

29:48.311 --> 29:50.540
to help him work through this
during his recovery.

29:50.564 --> 29:52.531
We even sent for a specialist

29:52.607 --> 29:54.908
all the way from the island
of Cuba to help,

29:54.985 --> 29:59.120
Mr. A.V. Catalon, a renowned
homeoneurotraumatist.

29:59.197 --> 30:01.634
- Dr. Herschel, I'm going
to be honest with you.

30:01.658 --> 30:03.978
That title sounds like you
made it up right this second.

30:04.002 --> 30:06.169
- Do you have a picture
of this alleged Dr. Catalon?

30:06.246 --> 30:08.358
- All you have to do is look
into the flap of his book.

30:08.382 --> 30:09.392
- [in British accent] What?

30:09.416 --> 30:10.410

30:13.503 --> 30:15.053
- Please, sir.

30:15.130 --> 30:16.416
- The Chief's behavior
is perfectly within

30:16.440 --> 30:18.150
the realm of normal for someone

30:18.174 --> 30:21.226
who has experienced
such severe trauma.

30:21.303 --> 30:23.562
The only danger is if somebody

were to fuel his fantasies.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.277
Am I being clear?

30:30.353 --> 30:31.954
- Yes.
- Good.

Now, if I am ever to see
you two gentlemen again,

30:35.317 --> 30:38.159
I hope it is in the area
marked "for visitors,"

30:38.236 --> 30:41.204

41:39.146 --> 41:40.808
- Why are you here?
- Super top secret, man.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.417
I can't tell you or anyone
from your department

41:42.441 --> 41:44.103
or any former members
of your department,

41:44.127 --> 41:46.002
especially not J...

41:47.822 --> 41:48.996
Jules?

41:49.073 --> 41:51.132
That means she's
still working this case.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.752
She lied to me, Gus.
She lied to me.

41:54.829 --> 41:56.115
I'm so turned on right now,
dude.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.783
- Shawn, don't be happy
about this.

41:57.807 --> 41:59.619
You are setting
a dangerous precedent.

41:59.643 --> 42:01.353
Honesty is the key component
in any...

42:01.377 --> 42:02.729
- Who's she talking to?
- This doesn't look

42:02.753 --> 42:04.189
like a hospital.
- Selene.

42:04.213 --> 42:06.692
- What the... dude,
we gotta get out of here.

42:06.716 --> 42:07.932
Selene found me.

42:08.009 --> 42:09.403
Damn it, I knew I was gonna
get caught!

42:09.427 --> 42:10.988
- Just act natural.
- What is happening?

42:11.012 --> 42:11.945
- Buzz, you never saw us.

42:12.021 --> 42:13.073
- But this is a crime scene.

42:13.097 --> 42:14.283
- Okay, listen very closely.

42:14.307 --> 42:15.826
- Guy in a ditch.
- Named Devon.

42:15.850 --> 42:16.961
- Faked death.
- Owed people money.

42:16.985 --> 42:18.161
- Got found.
- Got shot.

42:18.185 --> 42:19.454
- Now dead.
- Case closed.

42:19.478 --> 42:21.078
- We will waive our fee
for solving this,

42:21.105 --> 42:23.155
because you still have to
figure out who shot him.

42:23.232 --> 42:25.241
- Okay, but how am I...

42:25.318 --> 42:26.709
- Whoo-whoo.

42:29.038 --> 42:29.963
- Nope.
- Yep.

- Nope.
- Yep.

Move, sir, move, sir, sir.
- Do not let her in here.

but if I had a guess,

42:40.082 --> 42:41.435
a guy faked his death
and then got shot

42:41.459 --> 42:43.329
by the people
he was hiding from.

42:43.353 --> 42:44.455
- How long have you been here?

42:44.479 --> 42:46.679
- Ten minutes.
- Wow.

42:46.756 --> 42:47.899
That's impressive.

42:47.923 --> 42:49.223
- Thanks, Juliet.
It means a lot.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.017
- Hmm.

Here is the ballistics report
on the bullet

42:53.137 --> 42:54.072
that went through Lassiter.

42:54.096 --> 42:55.479
There was a second gun,

42:55.556 --> 42:57.909
which means the guy
who confessed is a liar.

42:57.933 --> 42:59.202
Don't tell anyone
how you got this.

42:59.226 --> 43:00.735
You understand?

43:00.811 --> 43:02.247
- I'm not sure I understand
anything right now.

43:02.271 --> 43:03.915
- That's the Buzz I know
and love.

43:03.939 --> 43:05.101
How's Francie?

43:05.125 --> 43:06.833
- Oh, she's teaching yoga
to horses now.

43:21.049 --> 43:22.434
- Then where do you suggest
we go, Gus?

43:22.458 --> 43:24.225
- We're in the forest
and we look like bears.

43:24.302 --> 43:25.779
- Yeah, but there's cops
everywhere.

43:25.803 --> 43:27.272
- No one is paying attention
to us, Shawn.

43:27.296 --> 43:29.232
No one.
- You're right, that's weird.

43:29.256 --> 43:32.058
- Juliet, if you would simply
take me to the hospital...

43:32.134 --> 43:34.852
- Selene, I am working a case
I have no business working on.

43:34.929 --> 43:36.966
So I am super sorry,
but I would like

43:36.990 --> 43:40.024
to respectfully request
that you shut the hell up.

43:40.101 --> 43:41.295
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

43:41.319 --> 43:42.722
I should have said heck.

43:42.746 --> 43:43.986
- You brought a friend with you?

43:44.063 --> 43:45.725
- It's Gus' girlfriend.
- Hi.

43:45.749 --> 43:47.977
- Oh, you're the nurse.

43:48.001 --> 43:49.228
- No!

- Shawn, Selene's coming back.

- Good call.

Careful, you're getting
footprints

all over Jules' seats.

44:00.388 --> 44:02.380
Stop kicking everything.

44:02.456 --> 44:05.016
You kicked everything
everywhere.

44:06.043 --> 44:07.385
- Shawn, she's coming.

44:07.461 --> 44:09.512
There is no reason

45:06.228 --> 45:07.807
I thought we were waiting.

45:07.831 --> 45:10.072
I assumed that we would start
with a hamster,

maybe a mini-leopard.

45:18.032 --> 45:19.384
I'm gonna have to replace them.

"Baby's Day Out" all over again.

- Shawn, calm down, calm down.

<i>[phone chirping]</i>

45:29.376 --> 45:31.635
- Lassie just texted, all caps.

45:31.712 --> 45:33.648
He saw Wilkerson running
down the hallway.

45:33.672 --> 45:34.972
- Wilkerson?

45:35.049 --> 45:36.369
The comatose dude
in a wheelchair?

45:37.676 --> 45:39.279
- I think Lassie's hit
a new low.

45:39.303 --> 45:40.572
We're gonna have
to deal with this.

45:40.596 --> 45:42.354
- Uh, shouldn't we be dealing

45:42.431 --> 45:43.355
with this whole
fatherhood thing?

45:43.432 --> 45:44.844
- Yes, but later.

45:44.868 --> 45:46.286
This Lassie thing is
the perfect reason

45:46.310 --> 45:47.954
not to deal with
anything real at all.

45:47.978 --> 45:49.164
How lucky is that?

45:49.188 --> 45:51.363
- And what exactly
are you thinking?

45:51.440 --> 45:53.032
- Well, it is that time.

45:53.108 --> 45:54.516
- What time?

45:55.945 --> 45:58.006
So now Lassie's seeing
some comatose man

45:58.030 --> 45:59.633
up and running around,
but we've got a real dead guy

45:59.657 --> 46:01.207

we've lost him forever.

- Shawn!

your moustache collection.

Pop, or you used it

for whatever

46:11.293 --> 46:13.385

going on right now.

46:25.140 --> 46:26.682
Big picture life stuff.

46:26.759 --> 46:28.161
- My only concern at the moment
is that my dad is

46:28.185 --> 46:29.535
a liar and a thief.

Do we even know if that merkin
on your face is real?

46:32.398 --> 46:33.667
- Stop!

46:33.691 --> 46:35.544
I thought maybe,
when you got married,

46:35.568 --> 46:37.754
you might take even
half a step toward

46:37.778 --> 46:40.149
being an adult, but you are
regressing big time.

46:40.173 --> 46:42.456
- Oh, well, I am way further
down that road

46:42.533 --> 46:44.083
than you can imagine being.

46:44.159 --> 46:46.544
And this just in, I will never
steal from my child.

I can't wait for you to feel
what it's like

to have to deal with a mini-you.

46:50.666 --> 46:52.394
I am counting the minutes to it.

46:52.418 --> 46:54.363
It'll be the redemption
of my life,

46:54.387 --> 46:56.062
watching you fail.

46:59.633 --> 47:01.934
- And all those years
you thought you were telling me

47:02.011 --> 47:04.195
things I didn't already know.

47:04.272 --> 47:06.188
- All right.

47:06.265 --> 47:08.107
Lassie is spiraling.

47:08.183 --> 47:10.161
We thought we were helping him
by looking into his visions,

47:10.185 --> 47:12.987
but now we're concerned we're
just fueling his imagination.

47:13.063 --> 47:15.300
- Okay, guys, come on, come on.
Now, look.

47:15.324 --> 47:17.669
Carlton is one of the best cops
I've ever known.

47:17.693 --> 47:20.005
He survived six bullets
and a stroke.

47:20.029 --> 47:22.340
His body may be playing
catch up,

47:22.364 --> 47:24.342
but his mind, it's as sharp
as I've ever known it.

47:24.366 --> 47:25.958
Come on, let's face it.

47:26.035 --> 47:27.721
He's never had much
of an imagination, right?

47:27.745 --> 47:32.117
So when he says this guy
Wilkerson is faking it,

47:32.141 --> 47:35.467

the crazy thing...

Quick ask, you know,

59:16.077 --> 59:20.755
When you first found out
that Marlowe was "with child,"

59:20.832 --> 59:22.944
would you say that you were
overcome with joy

59:22.968 --> 59:26.873
or was it more like
panic and confusion

59:26.897 --> 59:31.024
and, um, a lack of oxygen?

Asking for a friend.

Eh.

- Henry?
What are you doing here?

sensitive cow earlier.

at me like that?

a line back at the office.

No, you didn't hurt me.

I'm impervious.

let me finish?

you'll see the day

No... whenever that happens.

Your heart, it goes from being
inside your chest

to this other being

and that's the date
of the shooting.

01:02:43.284 --> 01:02:44.904
That's why he went
to the warehouse,

but I can get around, obviously.

01:08:09.527 --> 01:08:11.327
And you can't tickle for crap.

01:08:11.404 --> 01:08:13.913
- Why are you doing this?
Is this an insurance thing?

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:15.759
And is that a cactus
growing out of your head?

01:08:15.783 --> 01:08:19.010
- No and no
and stop touching my scar, man.

01:08:19.087 --> 01:08:20.920
- I gotta wake up.
Wake up, Gus.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:21.991
- Gus.
- Wake up, come on.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.600
- Gus, Gus, Gus!
- What?

01:08:23.624 --> 01:08:24.841
- We're not sleeping, dude.

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:26.728
I think baby Mary
was a hallucination.

01:08:26.752 --> 01:08:28.522
I'm pretty sure Wilkerson's
the real deal,

01:08:28.546 --> 01:08:29.982
but we're tripping on something.

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:31.692
- No, not something,
psychotropes.

01:08:31.716 --> 01:08:34.027
You suddenly feel like
you wanna confess something?

01:08:34.051 --> 01:08:35.643
- Yeah.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.520
I used to have a major thing
for Jewel,

01:08:38.598 --> 01:08:41.691
even after the Civil War movie
and the Bollywood song.

01:08:41.767 --> 01:08:44.443
I mean, the tooth
and the van story,

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.020
she could yodel...

01:08:46.096 --> 01:08:47.875
- Somehow they're getting them
into the patients' meds.

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:49.877
I stopped taking mine,
but it didn't help.

01:08:49.901 --> 01:08:51.408
[crunching]

01:08:51.484 --> 01:08:52.827
- Carlton may have seen
a zombie.

01:08:52.904 --> 01:08:54.578
- [quacks]

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:55.716
Did you know there are bodies
in your fields?

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.915
Oh, gosh, it's the ice chips.

01:08:57.992 --> 01:09:00.738
- What?
- Oh, that's just diabolical.

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:02.837
They know everything.

01:09:02.913 --> 01:09:04.630
That's how they get you.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.894
Hey, look, if they find out
that I'm still lucid,

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:09.010
I'm a dead man walking, okay?

01:09:09.086 --> 01:09:10.747
I have money.
I can pay you guys.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.680
But please don't give me up,

01:09:12.756 --> 01:09:14.401
not after what they did
to my best friend.

01:09:14.425 --> 01:09:16.893
- Devon Tileback?
- Yes, how'd you know that?

01:09:16.969 --> 01:09:18.729
- We didn't.
- Until now.

01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:20.154
- You're the silent partner.

01:09:20.231 --> 01:09:21.898
Tell us everything you know
and your truth

01:09:21.974 --> 01:09:24.066
will be safe in the vault
of secrets.

01:09:24.143 --> 01:09:27.403
- Um, we had an IPO coming up

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:31.157
and, um, we were cooking
the books that the company...

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.743
- No!
- It was Tileback's idea.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:36.703
- Shame.
- I just... I went along with it.

01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:39.665
The lying was killing me.
I was having panic attacks.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.654
And the next thing you know
I'm recovering here

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.085
from a stroke.

01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:44.223
<i>And apparently
I spilled everything</i>

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:45.712
to Herschel during therapy,

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.076
because a few days later,
a guy shows up

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.537
at our office saying
he knows everything.

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:53.470
<i>And he offers to keep
his mouth shut for a price.</i>

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:54.889
A steep price.

01:09:54.966 --> 01:09:56.818
Tileback played along
for a little while,

01:09:56.842 --> 01:09:58.893
but once the IPO was announced,

01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:00.561
they wanted to bleed us dry.

01:10:00.638 --> 01:10:02.718
<i>Tileback tried
to secretly meet up</i>

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:05.483
<i>with Chief Lassiter,
and they shot the Chief.</i>

01:10:05.559 --> 01:10:07.621
<i>They tracked Tileback down
and they cut off his hand</i>

01:10:07.645 --> 01:10:09.015
<i>as a warning.</i>

01:10:09.039 --> 01:10:10.249
He tried to disappear,
but they found him

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:11.822
and then they killed him.

01:10:11.899 --> 01:10:14.700
- Who is "they"?
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:17.578
They have someone working
on the outside,

01:10:17.655 --> 01:10:20.008
doing all their dirty work
so that they can't be connected

01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:21.540
to the recovery house.

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.676
Devon was so scared
and now he's dead.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:27.421
And I will be too
if they ever see me walking.

01:10:27.498 --> 01:10:29.643
- Then why are you packing up
your stuff and leaving?

01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:31.144
- Because obviously,
it's not safe

01:10:31.168 --> 01:10:32.093
for me here either.

01:10:32.169 --> 01:10:33.594
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:10:33.671 --> 01:10:35.232
Your secret is safe
in the vault of secrets.

01:10:35.256 --> 01:10:36.342
- Redundant.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:38.032
- From one jackal to another,

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:39.695
sit tight until we figure out
who's on the outside,

01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:41.936
because that's the guy
who shot the chief of police.

01:10:42.013 --> 01:10:44.842
[indistinct voice]

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.733
- It's Herschel and his twin.
- What?

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.037
- There's one guy standing
over there, Gus.

01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:50.621
How many of those ice chips
did you eat?

01:10:50.688 --> 01:10:52.947
- I just ate the last one.

01:10:53.024 --> 01:10:54.699
- You kept eating them
after we knew

01:10:54.775 --> 01:10:56.200
they were laced
with hallucinogens?

01:10:56.277 --> 01:10:58.297
- I can't help it, Shawn.
I run island hot.

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:01.163
- Ha!
Dr. Hersch... Woody!

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.260
- Well, hey, guys.
How are we doing?

01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:05.721
- What are you two
still doing here?

01:11:05.745 --> 01:11:07.014
- I get to cover
the night rounds

01:11:07.038 --> 01:11:08.629
for Dr. Herschel.

01:11:08.706 --> 01:11:09.847
- Dr. Herschel's gone?

01:11:11.676 --> 01:11:13.603
- Tell me that isn't the guy
I was supposed to be watching.

01:11:13.627 --> 01:11:15.678
- You know, not to pile
on the criticisms, Woody,

01:11:15.755 --> 01:11:17.691
but we're actually trying
to close up this case quietly,

01:11:17.715 --> 01:11:19.557
which means keeping
the evidence hidden

01:11:19.633 --> 01:11:21.161
until we know who
the outside triggerman is.

01:11:21.185 --> 01:11:23.602
- This is new stuff.
- What?

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.699
- Yeah, I went looking
for that Chiclet I coughed up...

01:11:25.723 --> 01:11:27.209
You know, five day rule
and all...

01:11:27.233 --> 01:11:29.887
I saw that we missed
some of the hidden bandages.

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:31.619
- Wait a minute.

01:11:31.696 --> 01:11:34.030
Is this a smoky topaz-brown
earmuff or am I imagining it?

01:11:34.106 --> 01:11:36.666
- I don't know anybody who
would wear a bloody earmuff.

01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:41.662
- Gus, I know where
the outside man is.

01:11:41.739 --> 01:11:44.259
- Shawn, will you get
your hand off my knee?

01:11:44.325 --> 01:11:45.717
[crunches]

01:11:51.064 --> 01:11:52.715
<i>- Gus, for the last time.</i>

01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:54.072
Someone from this ice bar

01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:56.155
went to the Herschel House
covered in blood

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:58.332
and got stitched up
mob doctor style.

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:00.609
Our highly skilled tracking dog,

01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:02.712
along for the assist
with this earmuff,

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.112
is going to lead us
right to them.

01:12:04.136 --> 01:12:05.864
- Shawn, we've done
this routine before.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.783
Do you not know the definition
of insanity?

01:12:07.807 --> 01:12:08.992
- Gus, please,
I'm going to leave

01:12:09.016 --> 01:12:10.274
the leash on this time.

01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:13.736
- So?
- Morrissey, smell this muff.

01:12:13.813 --> 01:12:14.978
[growls and chews]

01:12:15.056 --> 01:12:18.908
Ow.
Good news, bad news.

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:19.995
- What's the bad news?

01:12:20.019 --> 01:12:21.160
- He ate the earmuff.

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:22.703
- What's the good news?

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.299
- He clearly took on the scent,
Gus, body and soul,

01:12:24.323 --> 01:12:26.966
and he will now lead us
to the owner of said muff.

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:28.843
- Come on, son.

01:12:30.871 --> 01:12:33.264
[barking]

01:12:33.341 --> 01:12:35.049
- I'll be damned.

01:12:35.126 --> 01:12:36.353
- You're almost in, man.
Come on, come on.

01:12:36.377 --> 01:12:38.052
- [groans]

01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:40.096
- What?
- Ah!

01:12:40.172 --> 01:12:42.732
- It took four minutes for you
to get inside that window.

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.278
- Juliet Spencer O'Hara.

01:12:44.302 --> 01:12:46.655
- Shawn, I have never been
more angry with you.

01:12:46.679 --> 01:12:48.090
- You can't be angry.
- Why?

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:49.647
- Your blood pressure,
obviously.

01:12:49.723 --> 01:12:51.326
- What?
My blood pressure is fine.

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:52.630
What are you doing here?

01:12:52.693 --> 01:12:53.954
- We are trying to solve
this case

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:55.611
so that you don't get busted.

01:12:55.688 --> 01:12:57.224
We have evidence that the guy
Lassie thought he imagined

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.392
is actually real,
came from this place,

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.907
and is a VIP.

01:12:59.984 --> 01:13:01.002
More importantly,
what are you doing here?

01:13:01.026 --> 01:13:01.951
You shouldn't be alone.

01:13:02.027 --> 01:13:03.898
- I'm not alone.

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:06.205
- I wasn't gonna let her
come here alone.

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:07.632
And where's this evidence?

01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:08.885
- Currently?
Morrissey's stomach.

01:13:08.909 --> 01:13:10.443
- Or in his intestines.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.763
- By the way, it could come
back up at any time.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:13.236
What's your lead?

01:13:13.314 --> 01:13:14.130
- Final bullet
that shot Lassiter.

01:13:14.206 --> 01:13:15.631
I found it.

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:16.852
- And I found the gun
with the information

01:13:16.876 --> 01:13:18.134
she didn't directly give to me.

01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:20.344
- Nice, babe.
I'm proud of you.

01:13:20.421 --> 01:13:23.940
Now, is there anything else
you'd like to say to me?

01:13:25.384 --> 01:13:26.736
- Yes.
- Wait.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.270
[fake sobs]
All right, I'm ready.

01:13:29.346 --> 01:13:31.939
- The slug was traced to

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:36.152
a rare Norwegian-made pistol
registered to Ova Asblorn.

01:13:36.228 --> 01:13:38.070
- No, not that.
- Ova?

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.698
The bar owner?
[laughs]

01:13:40.774 --> 01:13:41.949
No, no.

01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:43.458
He's just a sweet retiree

01:13:43.536 --> 01:13:44.921
enjoying the second chapter
of his life,

01:13:44.945 --> 01:13:46.214
owning a mountaintop
watering hole.

01:13:46.238 --> 01:13:48.049
- We're talking
about Ova Asblorn?

01:13:48.073 --> 01:13:49.999
- Yes.
- The Butcher of Bodo?

01:13:50.075 --> 01:13:51.501
- The Butcher of what?

01:13:51.577 --> 01:13:53.127
- No, Bodo, Bodo.
Purse your lips.

01:13:53.204 --> 01:13:54.273
- That's a dope nickname.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:55.474
- Unless he's an actual butcher.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:57.425
Then it's a little on the nose.

01:13:57.449 --> 01:14:00.176
- No, Ova's a gunrunner,
a drug dealer, an extortionist,

01:14:00.252 --> 01:14:02.289
ran a major crime syndicate
in Norway.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:04.873
At least, before he almost died.

01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:07.391
- I used to run
a different business.

01:14:07.468 --> 01:14:10.186
- Please stop touching my scar.

01:14:10.262 --> 01:14:14.468
- Oh, my gooshen, Gus.
Ova had a stroke.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.901
He was a patient
in the Herschel House.

01:14:16.977 --> 01:14:19.456
- He's the outside man
and Lassiter's shooter.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.155
- Which means Dr. Herschel's
on the inside

01:14:21.232 --> 01:14:23.352
digging out the dirty secrets
of his rich-ass patients.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.170
- Feeding them to Ova
on the outside

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.744
to shake down the victims.

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.432
- Nobody ever put those two
together until now.

01:14:28.456 --> 01:14:30.342
- And we just figured out
the final piece.

01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:31.799
- Nasty dance.
Wood on wood.

01:14:31.876 --> 01:14:32.876
Nasty dance.

01:14:32.952 --> 01:14:34.877
- [barking]

01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:37.338
- Guys.
- Morrissey?

01:14:37.414 --> 01:14:38.881
Uh-oh.

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:41.884
<i>[menacing music]</i>

01:14:41.961 --> 01:14:46.305
<i># #</i>

01:14:46.382 --> 01:14:48.057
I guess it's not Ova.
