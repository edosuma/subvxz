00:27.723 --> 00:29.899
Xie xie for waking up

00:29.942 --> 00:31.248
And of course, dhonnobad

00:31.292 --> 00:32.771
to all my devoted
Chittagong gals,

00:32.815 --> 00:34.295
glad to see the floods

00:34.338 --> 00:35.818
haven't affected
your internet connections.

00:35.861 --> 00:39.082
Y'all look super clear
and ready for a show.

00:39.126 --> 00:42.129
Today, I'm debuting
a tera lift new song

00:42.172 --> 00:44.392
for my favorite people
in the whole, wide world,

00:44.435 --> 00:46.002
My Hi-Hat fans.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.570
Here's for
the birthday girl!

01:32.614 --> 01:33.658
Yes! Oh, thank you!

01:33.702 --> 01:36.096
Oh, look at that.
Looks good!

01:38.185 --> 01:40.404
Evelyn!
Have a piece of cake!

01:40.448 --> 01:41.536
What's the occasion?

01:41.579 --> 01:43.190
It's Leslie's birthday!

01:43.233 --> 01:44.495
Yup, I'm 21!

01:49.544 --> 01:52.068
Some of the women
can hear the singing.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.331
LESLIE:
Oh, no, really?

01:54.375 --> 01:55.724
Yes, I'm doing intake

01:55.767 --> 01:57.552
with a new resident
and her two children.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.902
Shit. It's my fault.
My voice carries.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.209
Me too.
Sorry, Evelyn.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.340
We'll try
to keep it down.

02:03.384 --> 02:04.689
Okay.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.517
And we'll clean up
before your 3 o'clock.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.562
Thank you.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.786
Congratulations
on your birthday, Leslie!

02:54.130 --> 02:55.871
There's a tajine
in the oven.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.090
Did you have
a good day?

02:58.134 --> 03:00.180
Ah, a woman came
into the shelter today.

03:00.223 --> 03:04.314
She was about 26,
her kids were eight and four.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.273
Last night,
her husband came home

03:06.316 --> 03:07.970
and locked the kids
in the basement

03:08.013 --> 03:10.625
while he assaulted
their mother upstairs.

03:10.668 --> 03:14.194
The police came
and only spoke to the husband.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.065
Luckily,
the eight year old

03:16.108 --> 03:17.762
recorded the audio
on his phone.

03:17.806 --> 03:22.550
So, you know,
every cloud, right?

03:22.593 --> 03:24.247
How was your day,
my dear?

03:24.291 --> 03:26.380
It was
very productive.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.859
Good, I'm glad.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.617
♪ That's the way

03:46.661 --> 03:48.228
♪ The earthquake rumbles

03:48.271 --> 03:49.403
Ziggy?

03:49.446 --> 03:50.752

03:57.715 --> 03:59.543

04:00.979 --> 04:02.372
Woah,
that was the first time

04:02.416 --> 04:03.721
I ever played that song.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.288
I can't believe
it went so well.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.508
I hope you guys
had as much fun as I did.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.292
Remember to upnote me
in the corner,

04:09.336 --> 04:11.599
and if you like what
you heard, feel free to tip.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.819
And there's
the early bird,
Ludmila!

04:14.863 --> 04:17.431
Nishrita, coming in
close second!

04:17.474 --> 04:19.041
And not to be done outdone,

04:19.084 --> 04:21.173
graciasto the Huertos family
for all your generosity.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.045
You guys are all tera lift!

04:23.088 --> 04:25.177
So make sure you all
come back next week

04:25.221 --> 04:26.788
where I'll be debuting
a new song

04:26.831 --> 04:28.572
about a girl
that I like at school.

04:28.616 --> 04:31.096
This is TheRealZiggyKatz,
thanks for tuning in!

04:34.143 --> 04:35.362
Mom!

04:36.363 --> 04:37.364
Mom, did you try
to open the door

04:37.407 --> 04:38.713
while I was
live streaming?

04:44.066 --> 04:45.415
Ah, motherfucker.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.199
Dad?

04:47.243 --> 04:48.375
Yeah?Did Mom try
to open the door

04:48.418 --> 04:49.463
while I was
live streaming?

04:49.506 --> 04:51.334
ROGER:
I don't know,
ask her.

04:51.378 --> 04:55.164
Mom, did you open my door
while I was... Shit! Sorry.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.992
Did you try to open the door
while I was live streaming?

04:57.035 --> 04:58.341
I'm taking
a shower, Ziggy.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.429
Did you?

04:59.473 --> 05:01.083
What's
"live streaming?"

05:01.126 --> 05:02.606
Where I basically
make all my money.

05:02.650 --> 05:03.738
Where thousands of kids

05:03.781 --> 05:04.869
who are desperate
to hear me perform

05:04.913 --> 05:07.176
log on every week
and tip me and upnote me

05:07.219 --> 05:08.873
and I'm one of the highest
performers on the site.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.048
Well,
that all sounds

05:10.092 --> 05:11.572
very impressive.It is.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.748
And, uh, what do you
plan on doing

05:13.791 --> 05:15.358
with all that
hard-earned money?

05:15.402 --> 05:16.968
Uh, spend it.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.448
On what, my child?

05:18.492 --> 05:20.189
I don't know.
Probably a new guitar

05:20.232 --> 05:22.583
and a new mic and probably
a better translation software,

05:22.626 --> 05:24.062
because I want to play
for African kids

05:24.106 --> 05:26.064
and they have like a hundred
different languages there.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.415
So you're going to use
the money you make

05:28.458 --> 05:30.068
from playing your songs

05:30.112 --> 05:33.071
to buy more equipment
to play your songs?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.812
Yeah.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.248
Well, that's
a tautological nightmare,

05:36.292 --> 05:37.337
don't you think?

05:37.380 --> 05:38.773
What?

05:38.816 --> 05:41.428
Well, it sounds like
you're on an exhausting loop.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.604
Have you thought
about an endgame?

05:43.647 --> 05:44.996
Oh, an endgame?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.171
I don't know,
I'm gonna be rich

05:46.215 --> 05:47.347
and you're gonna be poor?

05:47.390 --> 05:49.653
Oh, you're
going to be rich?

05:49.697 --> 05:51.829
And I'm going
to be poor?

05:51.873 --> 05:54.049
Yeah, just don't
open my door again.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.964
When you're live streaming?ZIGGY: Right.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.400
Right.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.758
Hmm.And the hearts of palm.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.934
Wow. Where'd
you get the chicken?

06:09.978 --> 06:11.632
Patsy's farm.

06:11.675 --> 06:14.591
She also had a surplus
of tomatoes, which I bought.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.506
Oh, very good.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.421
I'll make a gazpacho
tomorrow.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.380
I mean, it's basically
giving the guitar away.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.556
To get a Strat
from that year
at that price

06:22.599 --> 06:23.948
is basically free,
you know?

06:23.992 --> 06:25.776
Just make sure
you don't play the blues!

06:25.820 --> 06:27.256
What?

06:27.299 --> 06:29.040
You don't play
blues music, do you?

06:29.084 --> 06:30.607
No, I play folk rock.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.001
Classic folk rock
with alternative influences.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.306
I don't know
what that means.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.743
Well...

06:35.786 --> 06:37.092
I could play it for you.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.702
I just debuted
a new song,
Truthaches.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.748
I could show it to you.What did you
say it's called?

06:40.791 --> 06:42.184
Did you say Truthaches?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.795
Yeah.
Do you want to hear it?

06:44.839 --> 06:46.449
Well, I'm assuming
that we're

06:46.493 --> 06:48.495
not your
target audience.ZIGGY: Right.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.193
I mean, it's geared
towards teenagers,
am I right?

06:51.236 --> 06:52.455
Yeah, I... Sure.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.675
Because it's
incredibly unethical...

06:55.850 --> 06:57.765
White people
playing blues music.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.462
Did you ever read
Amiri Baraka?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.681
Who?Roger, please.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.509
Because he's very explicit
on the issue

07:02.552 --> 07:04.728
of cultural
appropriation.Jesus Christ, Roger!

07:04.772 --> 07:06.556
Dad, I don't play
blues music.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.862
God, just shut
the fuck up.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.559
Okay, okay!
I was just...

07:09.603 --> 07:11.169
I was just saying.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.717
Hey, Mom,
can you drive me today?

07:37.674 --> 07:39.328
Are you ready
to go now?

07:39.371 --> 07:41.373
Yeah, just give me,
like, five seconds.

08:34.557 --> 08:35.863
You're
on the city council,

08:35.906 --> 08:37.386
how difficult is it

08:37.429 --> 08:38.605
to get some goddamn painters
in here, Homer?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.171
We have women coming in,
it's the middle of

08:40.215 --> 08:41.608
the goddamn night, they have
nowhere to park their cars.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.740
We're talking about two white
lines on the fucking asphalt.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.308
Um, Ms. Katz?

08:46.351 --> 08:48.876
I just wanted
to let you know
I just did outtake.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.966
Hold on
a second, Homer.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.489
Yeah, I'm going home.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.795
Well, to my sisters,

08:54.838 --> 08:57.101
but I'm getting
out of here.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.363
Yay, me!

08:58.407 --> 08:59.713
That's wonderful, dear!

08:59.756 --> 09:01.410
Can I give you a hug?

09:01.453 --> 09:02.716
Um, yes. Of course.

09:08.983 --> 09:11.028
You saved my life.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.987
You saved my daughter's life.

09:13.030 --> 09:16.033
I'm very proud of you, dear.
Very proud of you.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.650
I'm sorry
about that, Homer.

09:23.693 --> 09:24.912
What?LILA: No, no, no.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.914
The US not only ignores
human rights abuses,

09:26.957 --> 09:30.134
but they purposely,
maliciously profit off them!

09:30.178 --> 09:31.309
And the worst offense

09:31.353 --> 09:33.224
is this sanctimonious,
savior complex

09:33.268 --> 09:35.662
where we're distributing
our morally superior values

09:35.705 --> 09:36.924
to the unwashed masses,

09:36.967 --> 09:38.316
like they're just,
sitting around the desert

09:38.360 --> 09:41.058
waiting for someone
to descend from the heavens.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.364
But what
would you rather,

09:42.407 --> 09:43.757
for China to swoop in?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.410
Or maybe Russia?

09:45.454 --> 09:48.152
Or maybe some other
amoral actor?

09:48.196 --> 09:49.371
It's not like
the US steps out...

09:49.414 --> 09:50.764
Yo, Z,
you want a hit?

09:50.807 --> 09:52.069
No. Shut up,
I'm trying to listen.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.418
CYRI:
...starts handing out
free bread.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.506
By that logic,

09:54.550 --> 09:56.117
we should just occupy
every country

09:56.160 --> 09:57.814
that might be
at a slight risk
of intervention

09:57.858 --> 09:59.642
because
we're the bastion

09:59.686 --> 10:01.252
of peace
and equity.Yeah, I feel like...

10:01.296 --> 10:02.906
Thank you for
making my point.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.429
I was
being sarcastic.BECKY: Oh, no. Don't do this.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.649
So was I.
Thank you.LILA: You're infuriating!

10:06.693 --> 10:08.216
Yo, I agree
with you, Lila.

10:08.259 --> 10:11.915
Thank you, Ziggy!
See, someone's got my back!

10:11.959 --> 10:13.656
Yeah, of course, man.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.962
Uh, huh. Yeah.LILA: Yeah. Very.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.050
How?

10:16.920 --> 10:17.965
What?

10:18.008 --> 10:19.531
How do you
agree with Lila?

10:20.794 --> 10:22.360
Oh, shit, yeah.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.232
Um...

10:26.234 --> 10:27.670
Well, you mentioned
China, right?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.106
Yeah.

10:29.150 --> 10:32.544
Cause I play music for these
Chinese girls on Hi-Hat.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.504
I actually have
like 20,000 followers,

10:35.547 --> 10:38.072
and I'm in the
top percentage
of performers. I'm...

10:38.115 --> 10:39.464
I'm validated
and I'm starred,

10:39.508 --> 10:40.814
which is tera
hard to get.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.903
And, like, the girls
I play for are super dope.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.688
There's this one girl,
SeaKitten, that's her handle,

10:45.732 --> 10:46.950
who tipped me
20 credits last week...

10:48.299 --> 10:49.474
...after I wished her
a happy birthday so...

10:51.563 --> 10:53.348
So, I guess, just in terms
for what you're saying, Lila,

10:53.391 --> 10:54.741
like, I totally
agree with you.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.092
BECKY:
A stirring defense!

10:59.310 --> 11:01.312
Becky, don't
be a dick.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.801
Ladies.WOMAN 1: Oh, hey.

11:14.761 --> 11:18.460
And he's not a big guy
and he wasn't even drunk,

11:18.503 --> 11:20.897
but he's got his hands
around my neck.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.638
Was this the first time
he did this?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.509
Well, it was the first time
that day.

11:25.946 --> 11:29.689
Then, he just kind of gets up.
He says he's got to go pee.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.647
Mmm-hmm. And then
you called the police?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.475
No, I didn't call the police.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.259
Oh. Um...

11:35.303 --> 11:36.696
It says, uh...

11:36.739 --> 11:38.872
Sergeant McKenna
brought you in. I thought...

11:38.915 --> 11:41.526
Oh.ANGIE: Right, well,
Kyle called the police.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.790
Yeah, uh, I called them.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.139
Eh, where were you?

11:45.182 --> 11:46.749
I was just next door
at Sean's.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.577
Yeah,
his friend Sean's.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.057
They've been
friends since...Right...

11:50.100 --> 11:51.362
Whatever....forever. Like...

11:51.406 --> 11:54.191
So she
texted me, and, uh,
I ran back home.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.758
How old
are you, Kyle?

11:55.802 --> 11:56.803
Seventeen.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.805
He's my little

11:58.848 --> 12:00.110
knight in
shining armor.KYLE: Mom.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.285
You are.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.504
You're the only
good thing in my life.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.853
Thank you.It's true.

12:03.897 --> 12:04.985
It's true,
kids are just
pure love.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.247
Do you know
what I mean?

12:06.290 --> 12:07.639
Mmm-hmm.

12:07.683 --> 12:11.339
You know, when he was just
six years old, um, Ms...

12:11.382 --> 12:12.993
I'm sorry,
what's your
name again?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.168
I'm Evelyn.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.299
Evelyn.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.387
Shit, I'm sorry.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.781
Well, when Kyle
was six years old,

12:18.825 --> 12:20.261
his father hits me

12:20.304 --> 12:22.524
and I get this nasty cut
over my eyebrow,

12:22.567 --> 12:25.701
and I didn't even know
that Kyle knew anything.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.270
I mean, who knows what
kids know about their parents?

12:29.313 --> 12:30.837
But, anyway,
he comes into the room,

12:30.880 --> 12:32.012
he says he's had a bad dream,

12:32.055 --> 12:33.187
can I come
and stay in his bed?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.449
Mom, stop.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.886
No, she needs
to hear this, okay?

12:36.930 --> 12:38.192
So, anyways,
we're laying in bed

12:38.235 --> 12:39.454
and I just whisper to him,

12:39.497 --> 12:41.630
"Do you want to tell me
about your nightmare?"

12:41.673 --> 12:43.545
And he says,
"I didn't have a nightmare."

12:45.286 --> 12:48.898
He just knew I needed to get
out of that room, you know?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.508
He's only six years old.

12:51.335 --> 12:53.424
So, he just...

12:53.468 --> 12:55.296
I'm a bad mother.EVELYN: Angie.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.950
No, no, no.
I'm a bad mom.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.735
Angie, you're not
a bad mother.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.606
You're in
the right place.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.131
You're very,
very safe

13:04.174 --> 13:06.394
and you'll have
two very comfortable beds

13:06.437 --> 13:07.830
for as long
as you need.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.746
All right, well...

13:10.790 --> 13:12.313
Hey, Mom,
you know what I think

13:12.356 --> 13:13.618
you could use right now?

13:13.662 --> 13:14.706
What?

13:14.750 --> 13:15.838
A new tissue.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.843
That's... That's... Yeah,
don't touch me with this...

13:23.890 --> 13:24.934
Take that.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.240
All right,
okay, sorry.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.589
Thanks.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.894

14:32.306 --> 14:35.265
Yeah.
It's a good system.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.662
You know, there are a couple
of projects around the shelter

14:40.705 --> 14:42.925
that could use a handyman.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.448
Like what?

14:44.492 --> 14:45.885
Uh, well, I've been waiting
on these goddamn painters

14:45.928 --> 14:47.799
to come out for this residents
parking spot out front.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.279
Oh, yeah?

14:49.323 --> 14:52.892
Mmm-hmm.
Just some white paint
with some blue trim.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.763
Wouldn't the city
need to do that,

14:54.806 --> 14:57.244
if it's like,
a street parking spot?

14:57.287 --> 14:59.115
I suppose so,

14:59.159 --> 15:01.074
but I'm sure there's a bunch
of other stuff.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.989
Just some bathroom mirrors
and some...

15:03.032 --> 15:04.294
And light fixtures.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.557
Maybe on the weekend,

15:06.601 --> 15:07.819
you could come in
for a couple of hours

15:07.863 --> 15:09.038
and then afterwards
we could...

15:09.082 --> 15:11.301
We could go out
to dinner together?

15:11.345 --> 15:13.216
This weekend?Yes.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.826
And it'd be, like,
as a volunteer?

15:15.479 --> 15:16.872
As opposed to what?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.178
A paid employee.

15:19.396 --> 15:22.704
Oh, yes.
A volunteer.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.184
I'm busy
this weekend.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.621
Uh, okay.Yeah,
so it'd be impossible.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.451
You're a very lucky boy.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.756

Lots of people
from school are here.

17:26.523 --> 17:27.959
It's not that mind blowing.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.483
Yeah, totally.
It's like,

17:29.526 --> 17:31.485
"Hey, everybody from school.
Tera lift to see you guys."

17:32.573 --> 17:33.922
Cool.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.229
Well, it was good
to see you.
Have a nice time.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.103
Hey, I thought
it was lift

17:41.147 --> 17:43.236
the way you were
talking the other
day at lunch.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.890
Like, about all
the political stuff.

17:45.934 --> 17:48.719
I just thought you
were super honest
and passionate.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.069
And, like, I write music.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.766
Yeah, you were saying.Yeah,
and in my music,

17:51.809 --> 17:55.204
I'm all about
being passionate
and honest too. And...

17:55.248 --> 17:56.423
I have 20,000 followers,

17:56.466 --> 17:57.554
and I think what
they like about me

17:57.598 --> 17:58.729
is my passion
and charisma.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.296
And I thought
you had that too.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.646
Thanks.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.996
Uh, I don't really think
about it in those terms,

18:05.040 --> 18:07.086
like, as a commodity.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.739
Oh, lift.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.004
Have you ever thought
about what you could do

18:13.048 --> 18:14.310
with a platform
like that,

18:14.354 --> 18:16.704
or are you just happy
taking people's money?

18:16.747 --> 18:19.315
Um, I guess
the first thing.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.665
Because it sounds
like you have a really
good opportunity

18:21.709 --> 18:23.493
to start a
grassroots movement

18:23.537 --> 18:24.712
about
environmental issues

18:24.755 --> 18:27.454
that concern you
or political corruption,

18:27.497 --> 18:30.065
especially if you're
streaming in countries
that are in need

18:30.109 --> 18:31.675
of organizing
from non-political
actors.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.199
Yeah,
I don't know, man.

18:33.242 --> 18:36.332
I think I'm more
of a vacation.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.205
Like, they deal
with all that shit
all day.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.511
Like the corruption,
and the poverty
or whatever.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.034
Like,
they're just, like,

18:43.078 --> 18:45.167
wandering
the dirty streets
of their towns,

18:45.211 --> 18:47.082
and then
they come home,

18:47.126 --> 18:48.736
and they see my page
and it's, like...

18:51.042 --> 18:52.261
Right.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.741
Like, sometimes I feel
like the world would be

18:53.784 --> 18:54.829
a better place

18:54.872 --> 18:56.135
if people
just chilled out

18:56.178 --> 18:57.658
and listened
to music, you know?

18:59.529 --> 19:00.704
Hmm.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.144
But, I mean,

19:05.187 --> 19:06.971
I guess
I could think about it.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.973
It could be kind of lift
to change it up sometime.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.410
Yeah, it could be.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.064
Because, like you said,
I got a huge platform, 20,000.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.153
So...

19:14.196 --> 19:15.589
Hear ye! Hear ye!

19:15.632 --> 19:17.199
We will not stand by.

19:17.243 --> 19:20.420
We will stand up
through revolutionary art.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.293
Let the performances commence.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.990
Are you gonna
do anything?

19:26.469 --> 19:27.818
I have a poem.

19:27.862 --> 19:28.993
Oh, lift,
I have a song.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.386
It's starting,
it's starting.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.693
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?
What's up?

19:32.736 --> 19:35.913
This piece is
about the patriarchy,

19:35.957 --> 19:38.612
of which
I'm a reluctant member.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.980
Sonia, hello.How you doing?

20:21.698 --> 20:22.786
Hello.KYLE: Oh.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.135
Hey, Evelyn,
how you doing?

20:24.179 --> 20:25.398
Very well,
thank you.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.356
How about you?
Do you like it here?

20:27.400 --> 20:28.792
Do you have
any complaints?

20:28.836 --> 20:30.141
Oh, no, not really.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.360
I mean, it's great.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.754
My mom's happy here,
that's the main thing.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.496
Hmm. What are you
working on over there?

20:36.539 --> 20:37.975
It's algebra.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.412
Oh, I would offer
to help you,

20:39.455 --> 20:40.804
but I don't remember
how to do it.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.285
It's cool. I... It comes
kind of easy to me.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.026
Well, you're
naturally very bright.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.724
Where do you
go to school?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.726
Hamilton.Oh, my son
goes there.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.600
It's a big school.Yes, it's too big,

20:53.643 --> 20:54.731
I think.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.300
So, I need your help
with something.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.910
What?I need
someone tall.

21:01.434 --> 21:04.175
I used to rake in like 200
to 250 bucks in a weekend.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.352
Oh, that's quite
a lot of money.You think?

21:06.395 --> 21:08.179
I do. I...
I do think...

21:08.223 --> 21:10.051
But the restraining order kind
of killed the whole thing.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.400
I mean,

21:11.444 --> 21:13.359
any guy that hits his
wife is terrible my book,

21:13.402 --> 21:15.143
but I could take it,
you know?

21:15.186 --> 21:17.711
Now, I literally got
no income.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.321
Well, would you ever want
to work anywhere

21:19.365 --> 21:21.758
besides
the autobody shop?

21:21.802 --> 21:23.020
I don't know,
my dad owned the place,

21:23.064 --> 21:24.195
so it was kind of perfect.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.197
It'd be like your son
working here.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.373
You said you
had a son, right?

21:27.416 --> 21:29.462
Yes.Yeah, so it'd be
a sweet job.

21:29.505 --> 21:30.637
I mean, if your mom
owned the place.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.597
Oh, um, can you pass me
a screwdriver?

21:34.641 --> 21:36.338
The, um, yellow one?Oh.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.557
The flat head.Oh!

21:37.600 --> 21:39.036
The yellow one?KYLE: Yes.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.736
Thank you.EVELYN: Here you go.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.651
And I was
seriously good at it, too.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.869
I mean, my dad
used to say

21:45.913 --> 21:47.001
that, uh, kids make
the best mechanics,

21:47.044 --> 21:49.090
because they got
tiny little fingers.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.831
Actually, it sounds
kind of creepy
when I say that.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.572
It does sound
a little creepy, yes.

21:55.618 --> 21:56.750
You're not going
to become him.

21:56.793 --> 21:57.838
What?

21:57.881 --> 21:59.230
You're not going
to become him, Kyle,

21:59.274 --> 22:00.754
if that's what you're
worried about.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.277
What? No... Why would I...
I'm not worried about that.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.279
Oh, right.
Of course not.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.759
Why would I become him?
He's a dick.

22:05.802 --> 22:08.109
Yes. Yes. No...
My mistake.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.893
I'm like a normal dude.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.634
Yes, you are.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.853
You are. You're...

22:13.593 --> 22:15.029
You're better than normal.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.510
I was, um...

22:17.553 --> 22:20.077
I was very taken with the way
you behaved with Angie,

22:20.121 --> 22:21.905
with your mother
the other night.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.211
What do you mean?

22:23.254 --> 22:24.604
Well, you were
very gentle
with your mother

22:24.647 --> 22:26.257
at a very
vulnerable time.

22:26.301 --> 22:31.785
Um, if I can
speak freely,
I was moved.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.439
Yeah, well, my mom's
gotten the shit

22:33.482 --> 22:35.223
kicked out of her
since she was born.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.312
I know. Do you?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.705
Well, I...
I can imagine.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.145
Kyle, would you be

22:44.188 --> 22:46.843
open to discussing options
for your future

22:46.887 --> 22:48.497
other than the body shop?

22:48.541 --> 22:50.107
Like what?

22:50.151 --> 22:52.675
Well, are there any other jobs
you might be interested in?

22:53.676 --> 22:55.112
Uh, when I was a kid,

22:55.156 --> 22:56.418
I always wanted
to play for the Pacers.

22:56.462 --> 22:57.811
The Pacers?

22:57.854 --> 23:00.335
Yeah, the
basketball team.Oh, right, yes!

23:00.379 --> 23:02.424
Well, um, is there
anything else?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.948
Anything a little
more practical?

23:04.992 --> 23:06.472
The body shop's
practical.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.996
Yes, of course.
Yes. Yes, it is.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.869
You know...

23:13.740 --> 23:15.437
I was just like you.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.612
When I was your age,

23:16.656 --> 23:18.397
I was determined
to become the editor

23:18.440 --> 23:20.399
of Rolling StoneMagazine.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.447
And then when
I went to college, I...

23:25.491 --> 23:26.840
I met someone
who introduced me

23:26.883 --> 23:28.058
to a life
of social service.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.277
And I'm,
I'm embarrassed

23:29.320 --> 23:30.670
that I ever considered
anything else.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.062
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.716
But people still need
to have their cars fixed.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.022
Oh, of course they do.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.458
So it's not like
a totally stupid job.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.373
Oh, yes. Yes, no, it's...
It's a very good job.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.462
It's...
It's a very
important job.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.247
But you have
an unusual heart, Kyle.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.771
I mean, most...
Most boys your age

23:44.814 --> 23:46.860
can't bring
themselves to be kind,

23:46.903 --> 23:49.123
and you can't
help yourself.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.429
You really think so?

23:51.473 --> 23:52.735
You're a special person.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.348
I'm sorry.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.437
No, it's cool.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.487
You know,
my friend Margaret runs

24:05.531 --> 24:07.881
the social work
program at Oberlin.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.056
Where's Oberlin?

24:09.099 --> 24:10.361
Well, it's, uh,
just next door
in Ohio.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.276
It's actually
a very beautiful town,

24:12.320 --> 24:14.844
and you'd be surrounded
by, by people like you.

24:14.888 --> 24:18.413
Bright, curious,
good, young people.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.632
How much is it?

24:19.675 --> 24:21.764
Well, there are all
sorts of scholarships

24:21.808 --> 24:24.767
for people like...
For people
in your situation,

24:24.811 --> 24:27.030
and Margaret
owes me a favor.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.728
Let me make
a few calls.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.686
Seriously?Absolutely.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.166
Yo, thank you
so much, Evelyn.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.734
It is unquestionably
my pleasure.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.694
Ohio.

24:38.738 --> 24:42.829
And we both
never tell a lie.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.048
Or do we?

24:48.312 --> 24:50.924
That was very powerful.
Thank you so much.

24:50.967 --> 24:54.057
Um, up next
we have Lila Stryjewski

24:54.101 --> 24:55.406
with an original poem.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.670
Yo, good luck, Lila.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.628
Not that you need it.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.375
Hi, everybody.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.508
Um...

25:09.551 --> 25:11.684
This is something I wrote
about the Marshall Islands.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.163
They're in the Pacific Ocean,

25:13.207 --> 25:14.948
and they've been
exploited for centuries,

25:14.991 --> 25:17.211
and now they're literally
sinking due to the effects

25:17.254 --> 25:18.995
of global warming.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.954
Um...

25:20.997 --> 25:23.260
I don't know
if it's any good or...

25:23.304 --> 25:25.567
I guess
that doesn't really matter.

25:25.611 --> 25:26.742

That was amazing.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.221
Like, transcendent
or whatever.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.701
Yo, sorry, man. I didn't
know where you went.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.052
Hey, Jackie.Lift poem.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.272
Would you mind if I read
what you wrote?

27:45.315 --> 27:46.360
What do you mean?

27:46.403 --> 27:48.536
The poem.
Can I, like, have it?

27:48.579 --> 27:50.059
What are you gonna do with it?

27:50.103 --> 27:52.671
I don't know. Murder people

27:53.759 --> 27:55.804
No, I just...
I want to read it again.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.069
Uh, next up we have Ziggy Katz

28:00.113 --> 28:01.592
with an original song.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.682
He's new here tonight,
so be nice.

28:04.987 --> 28:07.990
I guess that's me.
Duty calls, man.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.516

How's everybody feeling?

28:18.653 --> 28:20.220
All right.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.744
Um, I wrote this song

28:22.788 --> 28:24.746
when I graduated junior high,

28:24.790 --> 28:27.140
and I had to say goodbye
to all my friends.

28:27.183 --> 28:30.621
Sometimes, saying goodbye
to good friends is tera hard.

they only care
about political shit.

You're like a real artist.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.728
What are you talking about?
They loved me.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.034
No, they didn't.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.992
Those people were visibly
rolling their eyes.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.125
I heard one girl say,
"This is bullshit."

29:39.168 --> 29:40.996
And another one say,
"This is lame bullshit."

29:41.040 --> 29:43.129
Dude, if I worried about every
fucker who didn't like me,

29:43.172 --> 29:44.478
I'd never wake up
in the morning.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.610
It's the nature of success.Oh.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.545
Yo, Moms, what's up?

30:08.589 --> 30:10.417
I'm not shouting, Ziggy.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.332
I'll speak to you
when you're closer.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.433
Hello.

30:26.476 --> 30:27.564
Hey.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.566
How was your day?

30:29.610 --> 30:31.003
It was great, yours?

30:31.046 --> 30:34.528
Also very good, thank you.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.709
Hello.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.102
Where the fuck
were you guys?

30:43.145 --> 30:44.755
-School, man.
-I was at work.

30:44.799 --> 30:48.020
Oh. Today was
my Chancellor Ceremony.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.195
You knew this.
You both knew this.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.805
Oh, shit. Was that today?Oh, my God.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.546
I'm so sorry.ROGER: Oh, don't worry.

30:52.589 --> 30:53.939
I'm sure they'll give me

30:53.982 --> 30:55.375
another lifetime achievement
award at some point.

30:55.418 --> 30:56.898
Dad, I am so sorry.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.421
I had some important shit
to take care of,

30:58.465 --> 31:00.075
and I just thought that
Mom was gonna be there.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.382
Well, yeah, I guess I thought
that Ziggy was gonna be there,

31:02.425 --> 31:04.558
so, I...Jesus fucking Christ.

31:04.601 --> 31:07.082
What?You both could have come.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.389
The two of you.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.304
The two of us what?

31:11.347 --> 31:13.436
Everyone around me
is a narcissist.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.829
What does that say
about you?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.657
That I'm unlucky.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.312
I'm going upstairs to read,
try to keep it down.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.059
He seems upset.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.972
Ziggy, don't sneak up
on me like that.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.322
Oh, sorry, can you take me
to school?

32:56.365 --> 32:58.193
Are you ready to
go right now?

32:58.237 --> 32:59.499
I'm right here, dude.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.020
Can I change the music?

33:42.063 --> 33:44.326
To what?Literally anything else.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.414
I like to listening
to this music

33:45.458 --> 33:46.502
on the way to work.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.026
It's elitist.No, it's not.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.115
Of course it is. It's just
a bunch of rich, white men.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.899
I don't care about that stuff,
but you pretend to,

33:51.942 --> 33:53.074
so I just thought
you should know

33:53.118 --> 33:54.684
it's kind of hypocritical.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.904
Okay, thank you
for the advice.

33:56.947 --> 33:57.992
Sure.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.744
You doing anything
interesting in school today?

34:10.787 --> 34:12.398
No.Reading any books?

34:13.312 --> 34:14.748
Yeah, we're doing, um,

34:14.791 --> 34:16.793
To Kill A Mockingbird
in lit class.

34:16.837 --> 34:18.926
It's always Harper Lee
and never Toni Morrison.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.406
What?No, nothing,

34:20.449 --> 34:21.711
I would just... I would just
suggest you push yourself

34:21.755 --> 34:23.061
beyond the curriculum there.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.156
Mom.Yes?

34:32.679 --> 34:34.594
Do you think
I could be political?

34:34.637 --> 34:35.986
I'm sorry, what?

34:36.030 --> 34:38.119
Like, there are these kids
at school,

34:38.163 --> 34:39.555
and, like, they're super
political and stuff,

34:39.599 --> 34:41.122
and I was just wondering
if maybe

34:41.166 --> 34:42.602
you thought
that I could be too.

34:42.645 --> 34:43.777
Mmm-hmm.

34:43.820 --> 34:46.562
What do they talk about,
these other kids?

34:46.606 --> 34:49.652
Just, like, everything,
like wars

34:49.696 --> 34:52.829
and politicians,
and the environment.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.222
What do they say
about all that?

34:54.266 --> 34:56.137
Well, they're against
most of it.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.357
I mean, not the environment,
they're for that.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.359
Oh, that's a relief.

35:00.402 --> 35:03.449
So, um,
what are you asking me?

35:03.492 --> 35:05.407
Well, you're interested
in that stuff too,

35:05.451 --> 35:07.714
so I was just wondering
if, like,

35:07.757 --> 35:09.455
you had anything
for me to say to them.

35:09.498 --> 35:10.717
To get them to like you?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.414
What? No. I...

35:12.458 --> 35:14.547
I want to be smart
and interested too.

35:14.590 --> 35:17.376
Well, it sounds to me
like you want a shortcut

35:17.419 --> 35:19.117
to sound intelligent, to get
some kids to like you.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.205
I don't want a shortcut.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.641
No? Well, no,
what is it then?

35:21.684 --> 35:23.077
Because, I mean, if you want
to talk to these kids,

35:23.121 --> 35:24.078
then you should just listen
to what they're saying

35:24.122 --> 35:25.166
and form your own opinion.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.515
I'm not gonna spoon-feed you

35:26.559 --> 35:28.300
some cool line
about the Middle East

35:28.343 --> 35:29.823
because you won't
learn that way.

35:29.866 --> 35:30.954
Half the time
they're talking,

35:30.998 --> 35:32.130
I don't even know
what they're saying.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.174
Because you haven't
done the work.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.523
What work?Well...

35:34.567 --> 35:36.090
Well, you can't just jump
right int the middle

35:36.134 --> 35:36.786
of a debate about something
which you know nothing about.

35:36.830 --> 35:37.874
Yeah, okay.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.311
Look, if you don't
make the effort

35:39.354 --> 35:40.616
to understand the issues
that are affecting society,

35:40.660 --> 35:42.705
then your problems
extend far beyond

35:42.749 --> 35:44.054
impressing your classmates,

35:44.098 --> 35:46.056
and there's no shortcut
that I can give you...

35:46.100 --> 35:47.971
Mom stop saying
fucking "shortcut"!

36:01.550 --> 36:04.205
You know,
when you were
a little boy,

36:04.249 --> 36:08.035
I brought you to every march,
every protest.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.385
You were my little ally.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.561
You'd play
all our protest songs

36:12.605 --> 36:15.825
on that plastic rainbow guitar
that we got you.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.349
Where Have All
The Flowers Gone,

36:17.392 --> 36:18.437
The Fiddle and The Drum,

36:18.480 --> 36:20.308
There Once Was A Union Maid.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.396
You remember that?

36:24.878 --> 36:26.662
Your life was gonna be happier

36:26.706 --> 36:28.534
because you were
part of the struggle.

36:32.146 --> 36:34.192
You were gonna be
one of the good ones.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.153
And then something
switched in you.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.199
You stopped being
interested in anything

36:41.242 --> 36:43.549
outside your own little world,
and I...

36:44.332 --> 36:45.464
I would take you with me,

36:45.507 --> 36:47.379
but you would
always want to go home.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.295
Sorry about that.

36:50.338 --> 36:53.820
Now, I know that you want
to impress these kids.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.082
But it's not going
to impress them,

36:55.125 --> 36:56.779
if it doesn't come
from a sincere place.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.173
So, do the work. Read.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.131
Educate yourself
and then I'll help you.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.263
And then we can talk about

37:02.307 --> 37:03.917
some things for you
to say, okay?

37:05.179 --> 37:06.311
Yeah.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.098
Does that sound like a plan?

37:11.141 --> 37:13.013
Yeah, it does.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.928
Thanks for the advice.Of course.

37:17.147 --> 37:18.410
Have a good day, son.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.815
Jesus, Ziggy!

38:30.133 --> 38:32.135
I'm gonna go get
some baking soda.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.100
Yo, Lila, what's up?

38:40.143 --> 38:41.275
Hey, Ziggy.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.103
Just getting some
baking soda or whatever.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.410
Cool, man.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.802
Hey, I just wanted
to say that I was, like,

38:46.846 --> 38:48.413
rereading your poem
from the party.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.979
I just think it was so lift.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.634
Like, I love the phrasing
and the build and everything.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.462
It's actually
tera sophisticated.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.290
Thanks for the validation.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.813
But you should probably
put your goggles back on

38:57.857 --> 38:59.032
before Mr. Ryan sees.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.686
What's he gonna do?
Arrest me?

39:00.729 --> 39:02.035
You're a rebel.Yup.

39:05.517 --> 39:06.909
Just got the baking soda.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.652
Actually, I'm just gonna
go get some more.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.001
You're not gonna
help me?

39:12.045 --> 39:13.568
Jackie, fuck off,
I'm doing something important.

39:22.577 --> 39:23.752
Hey, and I also
just wanted to say...

39:23.796 --> 39:25.711
Jesus, stop fucking
sneaking up on me.

39:25.754 --> 39:27.756
Oh, sorry.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.149
Uh, I also just wanted to say,

39:29.192 --> 39:30.803
I know you talk about politics
all the time

39:30.846 --> 39:33.501
and I probably don't look like
I know what I'm talking about,

39:33.545 --> 39:37.026
but I actually know a lot
about all that stuff.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.593
Like, you probably
wouldn't know

39:38.637 --> 39:40.290
because I focus
so hard on my music,

39:40.334 --> 39:41.857
but when I was a kid,

39:41.901 --> 39:43.337
I went to every protest,
and every sit-in

39:43.381 --> 39:44.991
and I was a real ally.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.819
I even played
these protest songs

39:46.862 --> 39:48.429
on this little plastic guitar.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.909
Like There once Was
A Union Maid...

39:49.952 --> 39:51.824
MR. RYAN: Ziggy, goggles.Yup, shit, sorry.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.217
MR. RYAN: Don't say "shit."Yup.

39:54.261 --> 39:57.656
So, that's just,
like, what I wanted to say.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.223
Thank you for saying it.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.399
You're welcome.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.662
Ziggy.Yeah?

40:03.705 --> 40:05.533
You don't have
to be interested in politics.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.014
But I am.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.756
No, you're not.
It's obvious, but it's cool.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.367
You think I'm stupid?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.717
No, no, I didn't say that.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.806
So, can you teach me?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.634
About what?

40:19.678 --> 40:21.419
I watch you talk about things.

40:22.202 --> 40:25.597
Like... Like, big things.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.121
And you talk about them
with such passion,

40:28.164 --> 40:29.296
like the way most people talk

40:29.339 --> 40:31.254
about shit
they just want to buy,

40:31.298 --> 40:32.908
you talk about the world.

40:34.214 --> 40:35.476
I want to be like that.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.087
I want to be like you.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.603
Hello, Marci.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.692
Hi. Hi, Evelyn.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.520
Are you having a good day?

41:19.564 --> 41:22.436
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, it's good.
So far so good.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.264
Is your work going well?

41:24.307 --> 41:25.439
Yeah, it's great.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.267
Do you enjoy it?
Do you enjoy the work?

41:27.963 --> 41:29.051
Yeah, of course,

41:29.095 --> 41:30.879
it's very rewarding.

41:30.923 --> 41:33.360
Will you tell me again how
long you've been working here?

41:33.403 --> 41:36.972
Um, it'll be two years
next month.

41:38.583 --> 41:39.888
Are you firing me?

41:39.932 --> 41:43.152
No. Oh, no, no, dear.
You're a wonderful employee.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.415
No, I'm just talking.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.940
The elevator takes so long
to come here.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.731
That was a nice conversation.

42:29.764 --> 42:31.287
Oh, hi.

42:31.331 --> 42:34.073
Hello, I just, um, wanted
to see if you were all right,

42:34.116 --> 42:36.423
if you needed anything
from me or from any of us.

42:36.466 --> 42:38.294
No, it's been great,

42:38.338 --> 42:40.166
everyone is so helpful, and...

42:40.819 --> 42:41.907
Good, good.

42:42.995 --> 42:45.998
Yeah. Uh, do you
want to come in?

42:46.041 --> 42:47.608
Oh! Sure, why not?

42:49.131 --> 42:50.263
Is Kyle here?

42:50.306 --> 42:52.308
Oh, he's just in
the bathroom.

42:52.352 --> 42:55.224
Uh, honey, Evelyn is here.KYLE: Hey.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.530
Oh, jeez.

42:56.574 --> 42:57.836
How's it going?

42:57.879 --> 43:00.229
Oh, very well. I was just
checking up on you,

43:00.273 --> 43:02.057
making sure everything was
to your liking.

43:02.101 --> 43:04.233
And I said it was and...

43:05.234 --> 43:07.367
Is your shirt okay?

43:07.410 --> 43:12.328
Oh, uh, yes, it is. I don't
know why I put this here.

43:12.372 --> 43:15.331
Um, I brought you
this hat, Kyle.

43:16.550 --> 43:17.769
Indiana Acers.

43:17.812 --> 43:19.074
Yes, I noticed that,

43:19.118 --> 43:20.685
I think the P fell off
in the dryer.

43:20.728 --> 43:22.861
It was my son's,
but he no longer wears it.

43:22.904 --> 43:24.123
He wears...

43:24.166 --> 43:25.951
Well, actually, I don't...
I don't know...

43:25.994 --> 43:27.605
I don't know
what he wears anymore.

43:27.648 --> 43:31.521
Anyway, um, that is for you.

43:31.565 --> 43:32.653
Thank you so much, Evelyn.

43:32.697 --> 43:33.959
I remember you said
you liked them.

43:34.002 --> 43:35.221
He loves them!

43:35.264 --> 43:37.484
Evelyn! Kyle, say thank you.

43:37.527 --> 43:38.920
I just did, Mom.

43:38.964 --> 43:40.356
Well, it was the least
I could do.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.358
Kyle was very helpful
with some minor repairs

43:42.402 --> 43:43.882
around the shelter.

43:43.925 --> 43:46.014
Oh, I heard. He said it was
the highlight of his week.

43:46.058 --> 43:47.537
Well, I like staying busy.

43:48.669 --> 43:51.890
Oh, um, well, in that case,

43:51.933 --> 43:54.109
how would you like to
run an errand with me?

43:54.849 --> 43:56.155
Mom?

43:56.198 --> 43:57.678
You don't mind
if I borrow him,
do you, Angie?

43:58.244 --> 43:59.462
Sure.

44:06.339 --> 44:07.688
Feel free to change
the station

44:07.732 --> 44:09.777
if there's something else
you'd like.

44:12.345 --> 44:13.912
No, this is cool.

44:13.955 --> 44:15.261
It's not too stuffy?

44:22.790 --> 44:24.487
Okay,
now that's everything.

44:24.531 --> 44:25.967
All right.

44:26.011 --> 44:28.361
Kyle, just, um, just put these
in wherever it'll fit.

44:28.404 --> 44:30.145
Don't be precious about it.KYLE: Gotcha.

44:30.189 --> 44:31.625
Not too heavy?

44:31.669 --> 44:32.974
Of course not.

44:33.018 --> 44:34.454
Is that your son?

44:34.497 --> 44:36.064
No, no, no,
he's just a...

44:36.108 --> 44:38.240
He's just a kid
who works at the shelter.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.330
So, you'll appreciate this,
Kyle,

44:41.374 --> 44:43.202
Marcella does
all the translations

44:43.245 --> 44:45.160
for Spanish speakers
at the shelter.

44:45.204 --> 44:46.553
The women are
in and out of court

44:46.596 --> 44:47.902
all the time with custody

44:47.946 --> 44:49.817
and orders of protection,
and you cannot imagine

44:49.861 --> 44:51.166
how rigged the system is

44:51.210 --> 44:52.341
against non-native
English speakers.

44:52.385 --> 44:54.648
But Marcella is a genius.Please.

44:54.692 --> 44:55.736
And that is not
an exaggeration.

44:55.780 --> 44:56.781
I'm not a genius.

44:56.824 --> 44:58.304
No, no, no.

44:58.347 --> 45:00.741
You're more effective than
any lawyer we've ever hired.

45:00.785 --> 45:02.961
Look, you can
tell him the truth.

45:03.004 --> 45:05.267
I used to be a resident
at the shelter.

45:05.311 --> 45:06.704
Oh, really?

45:06.747 --> 45:10.925
My husband... My ex-husband
and I was undocumented.

45:10.969 --> 45:12.144
I couldn't go to the police,

45:12.187 --> 45:13.754
and I couldn't go back
to Honduras.

45:13.798 --> 45:16.061
Shit. I'm sorry
that happened to you.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.149
Thank you.

45:17.192 --> 45:18.933
My mom and I
are living there now.

45:18.977 --> 45:20.674
Yeah, my dad's kind of a...

45:21.196 --> 45:22.328
I know.

45:24.460 --> 45:25.635
What was that?

45:25.679 --> 45:26.811
Oh, sorry, I was just saying

45:26.854 --> 45:28.464
that my dad's
not really a great guy.

45:28.508 --> 45:29.770
Uh, you speak Spanish?

45:29.814 --> 45:32.555
I mean, high school Spanish.

45:46.482 --> 45:48.963
My goodness, you are
full of hidden talents!

45:49.007 --> 45:50.791
Oh, I guess
I just got a good ear.

45:56.318 --> 45:58.016
Uh, okay, Kyle, I think that
we should be heading back.

45:58.059 --> 45:59.713
I don't want your mother
to worry.

45:59.757 --> 46:00.801
Oh, I don't think
that she'll worry...

46:00.845 --> 46:02.498
No, no. We really should go.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.413
Uh, Marcella, thank you.
Thank you so much for this.

46:04.457 --> 46:05.501
It was great to see you,

46:05.545 --> 46:06.851
and I will just, um,

46:06.894 --> 46:08.983
I will just bring my mug
into the kitchen.

46:09.027 --> 46:11.420
No, leave it.No, no, I've got it.

46:11.464 --> 46:13.814
I'm gonna pop it
into the dishwasher.

46:13.858 --> 46:16.121
Oh, are these clean or dirty?

46:18.558 --> 46:19.907
Marcella seems pretty cool.

46:19.951 --> 46:21.996
She's fine. Do you want to
get something to eat?

46:22.040 --> 46:24.259
Oh, I'm cool just to
go back if you want.

46:24.303 --> 46:27.219
No, let's... Let's get you
something to eat.

46:27.262 --> 46:28.611
I owe you.

47:05.387 --> 47:06.736
Hello?

47:07.781 --> 47:08.826
Hello?

47:10.392 --> 47:11.480
Mom?

47:16.485 --> 47:17.660
I don't suppose

47:17.704 --> 47:20.011
you've had Ethiopian food
before, have you?

47:20.054 --> 47:21.534
Uh, no, definitely not.

47:21.577 --> 47:22.840
You have to
eat with your hands.

47:22.883 --> 47:24.885
I hope that's all right.Do they give you gloves?

47:24.929 --> 47:26.408
That's cute.

47:26.452 --> 47:27.888
I... I think you'll enjoy it.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.411
My son used
to love coming here,

47:29.455 --> 47:30.499
and then
he started complaining

47:30.543 --> 47:31.805
that it made
his hands feel dirty.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.067
That makes sense.

47:33.111 --> 47:34.721
No! You know people
get their hands dirty,

47:34.764 --> 47:36.636
it's a fact of life.

47:36.679 --> 47:39.552
You understand that
because you work with cars.

47:39.595 --> 47:40.901
I feel like I should've
brought a fork.

47:40.945 --> 47:42.555
Oh, no, stop it.

47:42.598 --> 47:43.948
You're gonna be just fine.

47:44.383 --> 47:45.471
After you!

47:45.514 --> 47:46.951
Thank you.

48:00.573 --> 48:02.618
Hi.Oh, Jesus. Fuck, Dad!

48:02.662 --> 48:03.924
When did you get home?

48:03.968 --> 48:05.970
Just now! Where's Mom?

48:06.013 --> 48:07.362
Working late, I guess.

48:08.059 --> 48:09.451
Okay.

48:09.495 --> 48:11.410
Do you want to, like,
order a pizza or something?

48:11.453 --> 48:12.541
I made a duck.

48:20.941 --> 48:22.551
You want some wine?

48:22.595 --> 48:23.683
No thanks, Dad.

48:24.858 --> 48:27.121
Yeah, it's not
very good anyway.

48:30.124 --> 48:32.083
So which one is Marci again?

48:32.126 --> 48:34.215
When you walk in,
she's the first desk.

48:34.259 --> 48:35.521
You've seen her
a million times.

48:35.564 --> 48:37.305
With the thick glasses?Mmm-hmm, yeah.

48:37.349 --> 48:38.698
Exactly, Marci.

48:38.741 --> 48:39.917
And she used to be
a wrestler?

48:39.960 --> 48:41.396
Mmm-hmm, I'm serious.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.486
Like, "This Thursday
at Bankers Life Arena,

48:44.530 --> 48:47.054
"I challenge you, Undertaker,
in a fight to the death!"

48:47.098 --> 48:48.534
No, no, no, no.

48:48.577 --> 48:50.057
No, no, not like that.

48:50.101 --> 48:52.886
No, college wrestling, you
know with the ugly one piece

48:52.930 --> 48:54.105
and the soft helmet?

48:54.148 --> 48:55.845
Oh, I can't imagine her
doing that.

48:55.889 --> 48:57.760
And apparently she
was ranked very highly.

48:57.804 --> 48:58.848
She was at IU?

48:58.892 --> 49:01.112
Mmm-hmm, big 10 school,
full ride.

49:01.155 --> 49:02.330
For wrestling?For wrestling,

49:02.374 --> 49:04.158
they give out scholarships
for anything.

49:04.202 --> 49:06.030
That's what we have
to find for you.

49:06.073 --> 49:07.248
Right.

49:07.292 --> 49:08.728
I'm still nudging my friend
at Oberlin,

49:08.771 --> 49:10.338
but worst-case scenario,
we get you in IU

49:10.382 --> 49:11.861
with a scholarship or aid.

49:11.905 --> 49:12.993
They make the process
unnecessarily

49:13.037 --> 49:14.299
complicated these days.

49:14.342 --> 49:16.257
Yeah, I was, um, thinking
about all that,

49:16.301 --> 49:17.693
like, since you mentioned it
the other day.

49:17.737 --> 49:19.260
Good. Oh, me too.

49:19.304 --> 49:22.350
Um, this is embarrassing,
but I actually got

49:22.394 --> 49:24.787
an online subscription to
US News and World Report

49:24.831 --> 49:27.355
just to check
the college rankings.

49:27.399 --> 49:29.401
Oh, Evelyn, you don't have
to do all that for me.

49:29.444 --> 49:32.621
Oh, no, but I want to.
I want to do it.

49:32.665 --> 49:34.406
Have you thought
about a personal essay?

49:34.449 --> 49:35.494
What's that?

49:35.537 --> 49:36.669
Well, it shouldn't
be hard for you

49:36.712 --> 49:38.236
because you've been through
so much.

49:38.279 --> 49:40.151
But we'd have to codify it
in a way that feels academic.

49:40.194 --> 49:41.674
Right.And it should be fun.

49:41.717 --> 49:43.023
You know?
It should be fun for us.

49:43.415 --> 49:44.459
Cool.

49:44.503 --> 49:45.678
Cool.

49:45.721 --> 49:46.809
Um...

49:46.853 --> 49:48.463
So do you like the food?

49:48.507 --> 49:49.943
I do, yeah.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.684
I mean, it mostly just tastes
like regular vegetables,

49:51.727 --> 49:53.294
but it's good.

49:53.338 --> 49:56.471
Because you're kind of
avoiding the red goopy stuff.

49:56.515 --> 50:00.258
Yeah, because the red goopy
stuff is insanely spicy.

50:00.301 --> 50:04.784
You know, in Ethiopia,
not eating the red goopy stuff

50:04.827 --> 50:06.307
is extremely disrespectful.

50:07.091 --> 50:08.353
Shit, really?

50:08.396 --> 50:10.268
Mmm-hmm, in fact,
if you don't eat it,

50:10.311 --> 50:11.965
they might even ask us
to leave.

50:13.836 --> 50:15.099
Okay.

50:15.142 --> 50:16.491
Shit. All right.

50:24.630 --> 50:26.153
Oh, God.

50:26.197 --> 50:28.025
Kyle.

50:28.068 --> 50:29.765
Oh, God.Oh, Kyle.

50:29.809 --> 50:32.942
I need a water.Here take mine, take mine.

50:32.986 --> 50:35.162
I... I was kidding.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.733
Jesus.

50:40.776 --> 50:42.778
"It's extremely
disrespectful."

50:42.822 --> 50:44.476
Kyle... Kyle,
you need to lighten up.

50:46.130 --> 50:47.218
Oh, no, no.

50:47.261 --> 50:48.523
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:48.567 --> 50:49.829
Don't spit it out because
now they really will

50:49.872 --> 50:50.960
ask us to leave.

50:51.004 --> 50:52.484
Okay, good, I'm ready to go.

50:58.142 --> 50:59.534
Ziggy?

50:59.578 --> 51:00.840
Yup?

51:00.883 --> 51:01.971
Are you happy?

51:03.060 --> 51:04.191
What?

51:04.887 --> 51:06.063
Are you happy?

51:07.934 --> 51:09.457
Are you really asking me?

51:09.501 --> 51:10.502
Of course.

51:12.025 --> 51:13.418
Um...

51:13.461 --> 51:14.941
Yeah, I mean, I think so.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.164
I mean, like, I'll have a
good thought in my head,

51:20.207 --> 51:23.950
you know, like,
"You just wrote a lift song."

51:23.993 --> 51:27.258
And, then, later I'll be
feeling bad about something.

51:27.301 --> 51:29.173
I mean, it could be anything,

51:29.216 --> 51:32.263
and the feeling
doesn't feel good anymore.

51:32.306 --> 51:34.134
Does that make sense?

51:34.178 --> 51:35.657
Like, I'll have
a logically good thought,

51:35.701 --> 51:37.659
but my feeling is still bad.

51:37.703 --> 51:40.314
And it just kills me because
it means that my thoughts

51:40.358 --> 51:41.837
and my feelings
are disconnected,

51:41.881 --> 51:42.925
and I could be
the most popular

51:42.969 --> 51:44.144
songwriter in the world,

51:44.188 --> 51:46.625
but it still won't
solve any real problems.

51:46.668 --> 51:48.540
Because no matter what I do
in this world,

51:48.583 --> 51:50.672
I'll always, kind of,
have a lingering pain.

51:50.716 --> 51:51.847
Yeah.

51:52.370 --> 51:53.893
Mmm.

51:53.936 --> 51:55.416
Why are you asking me?

51:55.460 --> 51:57.114
'Cause I'm reading
this fascinating article

51:57.157 --> 51:58.550
about teen suicide

51:58.593 --> 52:01.683
and it's highest in
your specific age group.

52:01.727 --> 52:03.207
Oh.

52:03.250 --> 52:07.602
And you being white and upper
middle class and educated,

52:07.646 --> 52:09.996
it's very high
for people like you.

52:10.039 --> 52:11.563
Okay, thanks, Dad.

52:12.477 --> 52:14.740
You want to read it?No.

52:14.783 --> 52:17.395
Mom's home.EVELYN: Hello, boys!

52:17.438 --> 52:19.179
I made a duck.

52:19.223 --> 52:21.616
Oh, boo!
I already ate.

52:21.660 --> 52:22.748
You did?

52:22.791 --> 52:24.184
Yes,
but I'll sit with you,

52:24.228 --> 52:26.186
and I'll certainly have
a glass of something.

52:26.230 --> 52:28.841
I opened the Malbec,
but it's not very good.

52:28.884 --> 52:31.626
Oh, stop it,
Malbec's always good.

52:31.670 --> 52:32.801
Hey, Mom.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.368
Hello, Ziggy.

52:34.412 --> 52:35.891
Dad's reading a fascinating
article about teen suicide.

52:35.935 --> 52:37.806
So what did you eat
for dinner?

52:41.854 --> 52:45.074
I took Marci to the
Ethiopian restaurant.

52:45.118 --> 52:46.424
It was her second year
anniversary

52:46.467 --> 52:47.686
of working at the shelter

52:47.729 --> 52:49.818
and I wanted to do
something nice for her.

52:49.862 --> 52:51.255
It was delicious.

52:51.298 --> 52:54.214
We ate with our hands
and it was very interesting.

52:54.258 --> 52:55.781
Yeah, I know,
I love that place.

52:55.824 --> 52:57.217
Mmm.

52:57.261 --> 52:58.479
No, you don't.

52:58.523 --> 53:00.046
Of course I do,
we used to go all the time.

53:00.089 --> 53:02.179
Yeah, and you told me
it made you feel dirty.

53:02.222 --> 53:04.224
It did, I had lentils
and shit all over my hands,

53:04.268 --> 53:05.704
but I still liked it.

53:05.747 --> 53:08.446
Oh, I didn't realize.
Maybe we can go back sometime.

53:08.489 --> 53:10.404
Yeah, sure, maybe,
I don't know.

53:10.448 --> 53:12.232
I have to go upstairs
and write a new song.

53:12.276 --> 53:15.192
I'm live streaming
tomorrow, so.

53:15.235 --> 53:18.325
Oh, don't worry, Dad and I'll
clean up your plate.

53:21.502 --> 53:22.982
No, no, no,
it's all right.

53:23.025 --> 53:24.679
I worked all day
and I'll just come home

53:24.723 --> 53:26.464
and clean up after you,
I don't mind.

53:26.507 --> 53:27.900
What do you mean
you worked all day?

53:27.943 --> 53:29.380
You just went out
to fucking dinner.

53:29.423 --> 53:30.729
Ziggy, calm down.

53:30.772 --> 53:32.774
Excuse me, I was with Marci,

53:32.818 --> 53:35.081
we were discussing a grant.
It was work.

53:35.124 --> 53:36.430
Yeah, I'm sure
it was really important

53:36.474 --> 53:38.040
that you discussed a grant
at a cool restaurant

53:38.084 --> 53:39.346
you used to take me to.

53:39.390 --> 53:41.130
I don't have to defend
myself to you, Ziggy,

53:41.174 --> 53:42.697
you're a child.Yeah and you're a shitty mom.

53:42.741 --> 53:45.265
Ziggy, sit back down.Shut up, Dad! Shut up, Dad!

53:45.309 --> 53:47.528
Oh, you're a wonderful son.
I'm so very lucky.

53:47.572 --> 53:49.965
You know what?
My songs make more money

53:50.009 --> 53:51.663
than you'll ever see
in your fuckin' lifetime!

53:51.706 --> 53:53.142
My songs will reach
more people

53:53.186 --> 53:54.231
you'd ever dream of reaching

53:54.274 --> 53:55.667
in your little shelter
in Indiana!

53:55.710 --> 53:59.236
Oh, okay. Yeah, go write
your little teenage songs...

54:00.672 --> 54:02.326
Fuck off.

54:02.369 --> 54:03.631
♪ Holding hand... Shut the fuck up, shut up!

54:05.111 --> 54:05.894

Yo, I'm actually

54:08.506 --> 54:09.637
It's a political song.

54:09.681 --> 54:10.812
Oh, yeah?

54:10.856 --> 54:12.379
Yeah! And it's gonna be
so political,

54:12.423 --> 54:13.815
it's gonna change
the fucking world!

54:13.859 --> 54:14.903
And you're gonna be
so embarrassed

54:14.947 --> 54:15.991
that you didn't think of it.

54:16.035 --> 54:17.428
Ziggy, Ziggy,
even if you wrote

54:17.471 --> 54:19.168
the best,
most political-est song,

54:19.212 --> 54:21.388
I doubt I'm gonna wish
that I wrote it.

54:25.523 --> 54:27.307
Just try not
to make any noise.

54:51.244 --> 54:52.898
Ev.I know, stop.

57:46.245 --> 57:49.335

57:49.378 --> 57:50.728
I don't wanna interrupt
your time or anything,

57:50.771 --> 57:51.990
I know that this is, like,

57:52.033 --> 57:53.557
probably your favorite thing
in the world,

57:53.600 --> 57:55.167
but I just wanted to say that
I wrote something for you.

57:55.210 --> 57:56.603
And if you had any interest
or any time,

57:56.647 --> 57:57.778
I'd love to play for you.

57:57.822 --> 58:00.041
Like, outside,
alone if possible.

58:02.391 --> 58:03.697
You wanna head out now?

58:03.741 --> 58:05.743
Yeah, really?

58:08.876 --> 58:11.531
Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous,

58:11.575 --> 58:13.533
I've been, like,
practicing all day,

58:13.577 --> 58:16.318
so that's probably why.

58:16.362 --> 58:17.798
It's actually a little cold.

58:17.842 --> 58:21.672
Yeah, yeah, so why don't, uh,
you sit there so that,

58:21.715 --> 58:23.891
you know,
you're comfortable, right?

58:23.935 --> 58:25.676
Uh, yeah, sure.

58:25.719 --> 58:27.199
Dude, you're making
me nervous.

58:27.242 --> 58:28.722
Oh, shit, sorry.

58:29.723 --> 58:33.031
I'll just sit here
on the ground.

58:51.310 --> 58:52.616
Shit, it's actually
a little tough

58:52.659 --> 58:54.574
to play from this position.

58:54.618 --> 58:57.098
Do you wanna
come sit up here?

58:57.142 --> 58:58.535
Where are you gonna sit?

58:59.405 --> 59:01.233
I'm gonna sit here too.

59:01.276 --> 59:03.670

Hey, stranger,
where have you been?

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:51.359
Just at a party
with some friends.

1:01:51.403 --> 1:01:52.578
Anybody we know?

1:01:52.621 --> 1:01:53.927
No, just actually some
really smart kids.

1:01:53.971 --> 1:01:55.624
Some really political kids,
actually.

1:01:55.668 --> 1:01:56.843
You wanna to sit down
and eat with us?

1:01:56.887 --> 1:01:57.931
Oh, no, actually I have

1:01:57.975 --> 1:01:59.411
a livestream
in, like, 20 minutes.

1:01:59.454 --> 1:02:00.673
You could just sit for a sec.

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:02.457
Oh, no, guys, sorry,
thanks anyway.

1:02:06.548 --> 1:02:08.159
Rog?

1:02:08.202 --> 1:02:10.639
I left something
at the office.

1:02:10.683 --> 1:02:12.598
I'm gonna go down there.

1:02:12.641 --> 1:02:13.773
You want me
to go for you?

1:02:14.469 --> 1:02:15.601
No.

1:03:11.657 --> 1:03:13.615
Hey there,
smarty pants.

1:03:13.659 --> 1:03:15.966
Evelyn, hey, what are
you doing here?

1:03:16.009 --> 1:03:18.142
Oh, silly me,
I made too much food

1:03:18.185 --> 1:03:20.057
and I thought
you might be hungry.

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:21.188
Thanks.

1:03:21.232 --> 1:03:22.494
I actually
already ate, though.

1:03:22.537 --> 1:03:23.582
Oh, it's pot roast.

1:03:23.625 --> 1:03:24.931
Yeah, shit.

1:03:24.975 --> 1:03:27.151
Sorry, my mom and I
just ate a couple hours ago.

1:03:27.194 --> 1:03:30.067
Oh, yes, of course,
that makes sense.

1:03:30.110 --> 1:03:32.939
Um, well, I left some
paperwork at the office

1:03:32.983 --> 1:03:35.986
and that's why
I came in, primarily.

1:03:36.725 --> 1:03:37.857
Well, yeah.

1:03:37.901 --> 1:03:38.945
Thank you, so... Yeah,

1:03:38.989 --> 1:03:40.425
thanks so much anyways.

1:03:40.468 --> 1:03:41.600
Um...

1:03:44.995 --> 1:03:47.171
Oh, I, um, I think we'll have
some good news

1:03:47.214 --> 1:03:49.695
from Oberlin tomorrow.

1:03:49.738 --> 1:03:50.957
Very exciting!

1:04:10.194 --> 1:04:12.109
I've secured two sponsorships,

1:04:12.152 --> 1:04:14.067
both for $10K from Hair Today

1:04:14.111 --> 1:04:15.329
and one
from the Clifford family.

1:04:15.373 --> 1:04:16.896
Oh, well, that's tremendous.

1:04:16.940 --> 1:04:18.419
Fred has never been
particularly eager

1:04:18.463 --> 1:04:19.856
to part with his money.

1:04:19.899 --> 1:04:22.641
But the downside

1:04:22.684 --> 1:04:24.773
is we're only half sold
as of now.

1:04:24.817 --> 1:04:25.905
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

1:04:25.949 --> 1:04:26.993
Yeah, sorry.

1:04:27.037 --> 1:04:28.386
Oh, no need to apologize.

1:04:28.429 --> 1:04:29.778
You're doing the best you can.

1:04:29.822 --> 1:04:32.564
But, last year
at this time, we were sold.

1:04:32.607 --> 1:04:34.131
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1:04:34.174 --> 1:04:37.612
Oh.
I'm sorry I'm interrupting.

1:04:37.656 --> 1:04:38.875
You all right, Angie?

1:04:38.918 --> 1:04:40.615
Uh, can I talk to you
for a sec?

1:04:40.659 --> 1:04:42.530
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

1:04:42.574 --> 1:04:43.705
I shall return.

1:04:48.406 --> 1:04:49.973
I don't know
how to tell you this.

1:04:50.016 --> 1:04:51.757
Well, tell me what?Well, it's about Kyle.

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:52.889
Oh, is he all right?

1:04:52.932 --> 1:04:54.760
Is he hurt?No, he's fine.

1:04:54.803 --> 1:04:55.979
Oh! Oh, good!

1:04:56.022 --> 1:04:58.285
Oh, don't scare me like that.

1:04:58.329 --> 1:04:59.896
Kyle's going to be fine.

1:04:59.939 --> 1:05:01.027
Oh, no, I know that.

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:02.202
No, I don't think you do.

1:05:02.246 --> 1:05:04.074
No, I do.
He is an amazing kid.

1:05:04.117 --> 1:05:05.379
You're very lucky.

1:05:05.858 --> 1:05:07.381
I'm lucky.

1:05:07.425 --> 1:05:11.037
Well, I believe that
Kyle has told you his plans

1:05:11.081 --> 1:05:13.561
on working with his father
after he finishes school

1:05:13.605 --> 1:05:15.215
at his father's shop?

1:05:15.259 --> 1:05:16.695
The car repair shop.

1:05:16.738 --> 1:05:18.305
Right, the car repair shop,
yes.

1:05:18.349 --> 1:05:19.872
Uh, yes, yes,
we've been discussing that

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.308
and I've been encouraging him

1:05:21.352 --> 1:05:22.919
to think outside the box
a little bit.

1:05:22.962 --> 1:05:24.442
There are some
wonderful programs

1:05:24.485 --> 1:05:25.878
where I think
that Kyle would excel.

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:27.445
He's... He's very curious.

1:05:27.488 --> 1:05:29.055
He's unusually sensitive.

1:05:29.099 --> 1:05:30.230
Yeah, I know that.

1:05:30.274 --> 1:05:32.798
Of course, you do,
you're his mother.

1:05:32.841 --> 1:05:36.019
Yeah, well, Kyle feels good
working with his father.

1:05:36.062 --> 1:05:38.108
He already works weekends.
He makes good money,

1:05:38.151 --> 1:05:39.848
and he feels good
about himself,

1:05:39.892 --> 1:05:41.285
and you're trying to
push him into someplace

1:05:41.328 --> 1:05:42.721
that's gonna make
him feel stupid.

1:05:42.764 --> 1:05:43.940
No one's gonna make

1:05:43.983 --> 1:05:45.289
that boy feel anything
less than brilliant,

1:05:45.332 --> 1:05:47.073
anything less than what he is.

1:05:47.117 --> 1:05:49.946
Well, he feels good
working with his father,

1:05:49.989 --> 1:05:52.122
maybe not brilliant, but he
feels good about himself.

1:05:52.165 --> 1:05:53.688
Well, imagine how good...

1:05:53.732 --> 1:05:56.430
Imagine how amazing he would
feel with a college degree,

1:05:56.474 --> 1:05:57.562
with something that he had

1:05:57.605 --> 1:05:59.129
no expectation
of ever getting.

1:05:59.172 --> 1:06:02.001
I think he must feel pretty
amazing when someone says,

1:06:02.045 --> 1:06:05.222
"Hey, kid, you fixed my car.
You're 17 years old,

1:06:05.265 --> 1:06:07.485
"and you fixed a car that
hasn't turned over in a year.

1:06:07.528 --> 1:06:09.139
"Now I can get
to work on time.

1:06:09.182 --> 1:06:11.010
"Now I can pick my kids up
from school."

1:06:11.054 --> 1:06:12.229
Yes, yes, yes,

1:06:12.272 --> 1:06:14.579
and I'm sure
that is a wonderful feeling,

1:06:14.622 --> 1:06:17.974
and that is exactly
what I am offering him,

1:06:18.017 --> 1:06:20.585
that feeling times a million.

1:06:20.628 --> 1:06:22.804
Okay, well we don't want it.

1:06:24.502 --> 1:06:25.807
You don't...
You don't want it,

1:06:25.851 --> 1:06:27.592
or does Kyle not want it?

1:06:27.635 --> 1:06:29.289
Yeah, I don't want it.

1:06:30.682 --> 1:06:31.900
I mean, I think
we're gonna need

1:06:31.944 --> 1:06:33.641
that kind of space.

1:06:33.685 --> 1:06:36.035
Yeah, I mean,
it's a little echoey,

1:06:36.079 --> 1:06:37.994
but the biggest problem
I'm having is Steven.

1:06:38.037 --> 1:06:40.126
He's, like, texting me
every five minutes.

1:06:40.170 --> 1:06:42.302
He thinks he's gonna be
the emcee.

1:06:42.346 --> 1:06:43.477
He's working on his jokes,

1:06:43.521 --> 1:06:44.870
but we're gonna
have kids there.

1:06:44.913 --> 1:06:46.654
Well, I think the kids
are more important

1:06:46.698 --> 1:06:49.483
as far as the community
and everything is involved.

1:07:57.986 --> 1:07:59.553
Paging Kyle Marks.

1:07:59.597 --> 1:08:01.555
Would Kyle Marks please
report to the office?

1:08:01.599 --> 1:08:05.081
I repeat, would Kyle Marks
please report to the office?

1:08:06.430 --> 1:08:08.649
Hey, get me a muffin!Yo, shut up, man!

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:13.872
Oh, my God,
haven't you seen that?

1:08:13.915 --> 1:08:15.265
I know, it's like,
I don't even know

1:08:15.308 --> 1:08:16.614
what to wear.

1:08:18.572 --> 1:08:21.053
It's like,
you're egotistical. Really?

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:22.359
What, narcissism
and arrogance?

1:08:22.402 --> 1:08:24.100
Well, I...

1:08:24.143 --> 1:08:25.971
Yo, yo, yo,
how's it going everybody?

1:08:26.014 --> 1:08:27.233
Hey, Lila.

1:08:27.277 --> 1:08:28.539
Sit down, sit down,
Troubadour.

1:08:28.582 --> 1:08:29.757
Oh, lift!

1:08:29.801 --> 1:08:32.369
Cool, no, I don't
wanna interrupt anything.

1:08:32.412 --> 1:08:34.588
So, uh, what are you guys
talking about?

1:08:34.632 --> 1:08:36.590
Becky's thinking about
getting her tongue pierced.

1:08:36.634 --> 1:08:38.070
Which is obviously
a terrible idea.

1:08:38.114 --> 1:08:39.158
Yes, I am. It's my tongue.

1:08:39.202 --> 1:08:40.464
Uh-uh, not after you
get it pierced,

1:08:40.507 --> 1:08:41.595
then it's the world's tongue.

1:08:41.639 --> 1:08:42.988
You know that!I just thought you guys

1:08:43.031 --> 1:08:44.294
were talking
about political stuff

1:08:44.337 --> 1:08:46.034
like you usually do.It is political.

1:08:46.078 --> 1:08:47.123
It's my body.

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:48.298
It's an important muscle.

1:08:48.341 --> 1:08:50.517
You will have no taste buds.Stop being rude.

1:08:50.561 --> 1:08:52.911
Oh, no, I just want
like world politics

1:08:52.954 --> 1:08:55.087
'cause Lila and I were kind
of working on this song

1:08:55.131 --> 1:08:56.175
for the Marshall Islands.

1:08:56.219 --> 1:08:58.046
Oh, really?Yeah, um,

1:08:58.090 --> 1:09:00.527
Ziggy did, like, the weirdest,
possibly nicest thing.

1:09:00.571 --> 1:09:02.877
He took this poem I wrote
and set it to music.

1:09:02.921 --> 1:09:04.966
Yeah, that's actually
why I came over here.

1:09:05.010 --> 1:09:07.230
I played it last night
on Hi-Hat.

1:09:07.273 --> 1:09:09.101
That's where I have
20,000 followers,

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:10.537
and I'm validated
and starred and everything.

1:09:10.581 --> 1:09:12.148
You told us.Oh, really?

1:09:12.191 --> 1:09:13.584
Mmm-hmm.Oh, lift.

1:09:13.627 --> 1:09:15.542
Anyways, I don't really
sing about political shit,

1:09:15.586 --> 1:09:17.631
'cause I feel like people
don't really like that stuff,

1:09:17.675 --> 1:09:18.937
and also it doesn't
really translate

1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:20.591
because of
the language barrier,

1:09:20.634 --> 1:09:22.114
but I played
the Marshall Islands song

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:25.248
last night, right?
And I got, like, 83 up notes,

1:09:25.291 --> 1:09:27.075
which translates
to, like, 90 bucks

1:09:27.119 --> 1:09:29.077
before Hi-Hat deductions.CYRIL: Hmm.

1:09:29.121 --> 1:09:30.557
And it's so funny,
'cause you, Lila,

1:09:30.601 --> 1:09:33.647
you said that I had a huge
platform to be political.

1:09:33.691 --> 1:09:35.214
And I never really wanted
to do that

1:09:35.258 --> 1:09:36.911
because I thought it'd make me
less money,

1:09:36.955 --> 1:09:40.393
but last night proves that
I can both be political

1:09:40.437 --> 1:09:42.003
and make money.

1:09:42.047 --> 1:09:44.397
Wow.Isn't that awesome?

1:09:46.225 --> 1:09:47.226
Kyle!

1:09:47.835 --> 1:09:49.837
Hello!

1:09:52.492 --> 1:09:54.581
How are you, dear?Uh, I'm fine.

1:09:54.625 --> 1:09:56.801
What's up, Evelyn?Oh, I had to speak to you...

1:09:56.844 --> 1:09:58.455
Oh, forgive me.It's cool.

1:09:58.498 --> 1:10:01.240
Is my mom okay?Oh, yes, Angie's fine.

1:10:01.284 --> 1:10:02.676
Oh, actually, I don't know.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.243
I really don't know...Wait, what happened?

1:10:04.287 --> 1:10:06.071
I just spoke to her,

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:08.813
and she said that, um,
that you and she had discussed

1:10:08.856 --> 1:10:10.554
what we had been
working on together,

1:10:10.597 --> 1:10:15.428
and I wanted to get
some clarity on the situation.

1:10:15.472 --> 1:10:16.908
Shit! Um...

1:10:17.952 --> 1:10:19.302
I'm sorry about that.

1:10:19.345 --> 1:10:20.738
What did she say?

1:10:20.781 --> 1:10:22.174
Well, she said
that she was worried

1:10:22.218 --> 1:10:24.220
that you wouldn't fit in
with the other students,

1:10:24.263 --> 1:10:26.004
and that you wouldn't excel,

1:10:26.047 --> 1:10:28.963
and both you and I know
that that could not be further

1:10:29.007 --> 1:10:30.704
from the truth.

1:10:30.748 --> 1:10:33.751
But I inferred
from what she said to me

1:10:33.794 --> 1:10:35.056
that I may have overstepped,

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:37.015
and if I have,
I would be mortified.

1:10:37.058 --> 1:10:38.146
Frankly, I would be mortified.

1:10:38.190 --> 1:10:39.278
You know, she's just, well...

1:10:39.322 --> 1:10:41.367
She's been
really emotional lately.

1:10:42.325 --> 1:10:43.978
I told her not to talk to you.

1:10:44.022 --> 1:10:46.633
Okay, okay, well,
I understand.

1:10:46.677 --> 1:10:48.940
I mean, she's a good mother.
She's a very concerned mother,

1:10:48.983 --> 1:10:50.855
and we've all been there,

1:10:50.898 --> 1:10:52.596
and it's a big change.

1:10:52.639 --> 1:10:56.295
I mean, not just for you,
but for your entire family.

1:10:56.339 --> 1:11:00.604
Yeah, uh,
and what if I don't want it?

1:11:01.431 --> 1:11:02.562
Don't want what?

1:11:02.606 --> 1:11:03.824
School and all that.

1:11:05.348 --> 1:11:08.220
Um, 'cause I don't think
that I really want to go.

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:10.309
I'm sorry, I know that you've
been thinking about it a lot

1:11:10.353 --> 1:11:11.484
and that it's important
to you.

1:11:11.528 --> 1:11:14.400
Just, uh, I talked to my dad

1:11:14.444 --> 1:11:16.533
and, uh, we all think it's
a good idea

1:11:16.576 --> 1:11:18.143
if I start working
with him more.

1:11:19.144 --> 1:11:20.493
Ziggy, do not follow me.

1:11:20.537 --> 1:11:22.147
Lila, just explain
to me what I did wrong?

1:11:22.190 --> 1:11:23.757
Why are you so fucking stupid?

1:11:23.801 --> 1:11:25.324
Maybe I am. I just,
I thought you'd be proud.

1:11:25.368 --> 1:11:28.632
Oh, proud? Proud?
How could I be proud?

1:11:28.675 --> 1:11:29.763
You exploited me.

1:11:29.807 --> 1:11:31.243
You exploited
the fucking poor people

1:11:31.287 --> 1:11:32.549
in the Marshall Islands

1:11:32.592 --> 1:11:34.420
like they have any more
reason to be miserable,

1:11:34.464 --> 1:11:35.595
and you exploited yourself.

1:11:35.639 --> 1:11:37.249
How the fuck
did I exploit anyone?

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:39.817
I wrote this killer
fucking lift song with you.

1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:40.948
We worked together,

1:11:40.992 --> 1:11:42.602
and I used it
to raise awareness

1:11:42.646 --> 1:11:44.082
for a major world problem.

1:11:44.125 --> 1:11:46.476
And then you would have
the audacity to brag about it

1:11:46.519 --> 1:11:48.608
to me
like you're a fucking god.

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:50.654
Changing the world
takes doing real work

1:11:50.697 --> 1:11:53.047
and actually giving
a shit about real people.

1:11:53.091 --> 1:11:54.135
You can't...But maybe

1:11:54.179 --> 1:11:55.528
I can change things.You can't.

1:11:55.572 --> 1:11:57.225
No, maybe we can, like a team.

1:11:57.269 --> 1:11:59.837
We're not a team, Ziggy.
You're like a little boy.

1:12:01.534 --> 1:12:02.753
I know that's scary.

1:12:02.796 --> 1:12:04.581
We all have imposter syndrome.

1:12:04.624 --> 1:12:06.191
I understand that.

1:12:06.234 --> 1:12:08.933
I am constantly striving
to have my character

1:12:08.976 --> 1:12:10.195
match up to my ideals...

1:12:10.238 --> 1:12:11.762
Okay, okay, yeah.
No, I understand.

1:12:11.805 --> 1:12:14.330
But it steels you,
it strengthens you.

1:12:14.373 --> 1:12:16.375
It's the only way
to learn and to grow

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:18.725
and to live
a more examined life,

1:12:18.769 --> 1:12:20.074
to make an impact.Not that...

1:12:20.118 --> 1:12:21.641
Don't you want that?Yeah, I guess.

1:12:21.685 --> 1:12:24.078
Yes, of course you do. Because
that is what everyone wants.

1:12:24.122 --> 1:12:25.645
I know, I just can't really
think about it right now.

1:12:25.689 --> 1:12:26.864
No, but right now is the time.

1:12:26.907 --> 1:12:28.256
Right now is the time
that you have

1:12:28.300 --> 1:12:29.345
to think about it.Evelyn, just please, stop!

1:12:29.388 --> 1:12:30.476
Just, please,
please, just stop,

1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:32.348
stop, please, stop!

1:12:33.261 --> 1:12:34.393
Please!

1:12:42.575 --> 1:12:45.361
I'm sorry. Oh, no, no.

1:12:48.668 --> 1:12:50.714
You're not gonna, like,
kick us out, right?

1:12:50.757 --> 1:12:52.280
What?

1:12:52.324 --> 1:12:54.413
Like, if I don't
go to college,

1:12:54.457 --> 1:12:56.372
you're not gonna
make us leave, right?

1:12:59.244 --> 1:13:02.073
Oh, God. Oh, my God,
no, I mean,

1:13:02.116 --> 1:13:03.988
oh, Kyle, these things are...

1:13:05.381 --> 1:13:07.165
Okay.These things are separate.

1:13:07.208 --> 1:13:10.777
These things are totally
separate. They're not...

1:13:10.821 --> 1:13:14.085
All right, thank... Thank you.
Really, thank you, Ms. Katz.

1:13:15.173 --> 1:13:17.001
'Cause my mom
really feels safe there.

1:13:17.871 --> 1:13:19.699
Well, she is.

1:13:19.743 --> 1:13:21.179
She is very safe there,

1:13:21.222 --> 1:13:24.400
and you're both very safe.

1:13:33.670 --> 1:13:35.933
Ah, fuck.

1:13:49.773 --> 1:13:51.383
