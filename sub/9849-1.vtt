00:14.000 --> 00:16.003
Girl: Isn't It Funny
How People On Tv

00:16.035 --> 00:19.472
Lead The Most
Amazingly Perfect Lives?

00:19.506 --> 00:21.207
Lucky Them, Huh?

00:21.240 --> 00:24.846
Anyway, That's Me With
My Twin Brother, Eddie.

00:27.347 --> 00:31.419
Can You Tell I'm Obsessively
Attached To My Camera?

00:31.451 --> 00:32.753
My Dad Says If I Could've,

00:32.786 --> 00:35.389
I Probably Would've
Filmed My Own Birth.

00:35.421 --> 00:36.923
And My Friends?

00:36.957 --> 00:41.061
They Love
Being In My Movies.

00:41.094 --> 00:43.597
Come On, Just
Jump Up There And Do It.

00:43.630 --> 00:45.066
You Do It.

00:45.098 --> 00:46.399
[Groans]

00:46.432 --> 00:49.103
Denisey?

00:49.136 --> 00:50.103
No.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.204
Don't You Think

00:51.237 --> 00:52.939
We're Getting A Little Too Old For This?

00:52.972 --> 00:54.408
Come On.

00:54.441 --> 00:55.910
You Two Would
Make The Perfect

00:55.942 --> 00:59.846
Tragic Romantic Couple.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.650
Jakey.

01:06.219 --> 01:07.754
I'm King
Of The World.

01:07.787 --> 01:09.090
[Laughs]

01:09.123 --> 01:10.925
Cut. Great.

01:10.957 --> 01:12.358
I'm Not
Doing It Again.

01:12.391 --> 01:13.359
Why Not?

01:13.393 --> 01:15.763
'Cause We're
In High School Now,

01:15.796 --> 01:18.899
And I Have A Reputation
To Protect.

01:18.932 --> 01:20.100
Since When?

01:20.134 --> 01:21.902
In Case
You Haven't Noticed,

01:21.935 --> 01:22.903
Tru Won't Be Happy

01:22.935 --> 01:24.537
Until She Turns
Her Entire Life

01:24.570 --> 01:26.340
Into A Sitcom.

01:40.921 --> 01:42.456
And Here's Another Thing:

01:42.489 --> 01:45.225
On Tv, No Matter
How Gigantic Your Problems Are,

01:45.259 --> 01:47.460
By The Final Commercial,
Everything's Wrapped Up.

01:47.493 --> 01:48.763
Everybody's Happy.

01:48.796 --> 01:50.331
Who Wouldn't
Want To Live Like That?

01:50.364 --> 01:53.433
Yeah, But Talk About Totally Predictable And Boring.

01:53.466 --> 01:55.435
Hey, Reality's Harsh.

01:55.468 --> 01:57.671
I Would Much Rather
Live Inside The Tube.

02:16.989 --> 02:19.493
[Chatter]

02:21.862 --> 02:23.331
[Screams]

02:35.374 --> 02:37.644
[Giggling]

02:40.647 --> 02:43.951
Paparazzi!
Paparazzi, Tru!

02:43.983 --> 02:45.285
Stop It Now, Eddie.
You're Gonna--

02:45.319 --> 02:47.021
Paparazzi!
Paparazzi!

02:47.053 --> 02:49.289
Paparazzi!

02:49.322 --> 02:50.790
Give Me The Camera.
You Are Not A Paparazzi.

02:50.823 --> 02:52.125
Paparazzi!

02:52.159 --> 02:54.295
Stop It! Eddie!

02:54.327 --> 02:55.962
Hey, Hey, Hey,
Stop It! Stop!

02:55.995 --> 02:57.331
Knock It Off!

03:00.733 --> 03:01.701
What Is Going On Here?

03:01.734 --> 03:03.136
He Came
Jumping Out At Us,

03:03.170 --> 03:05.405
Shooting This Thing
Off In Our Faces.

03:06.773 --> 03:09.810
Uh, Maybe We Ought
To Take Off.

03:09.843 --> 03:11.679
No. Come On. You Guys
Don't Have To Go.

03:11.712 --> 03:12.646
Denise: No, It's Ok.

03:12.678 --> 03:14.480
I'll Call You
Tomorrow.

03:14.513 --> 03:17.317
[Sighs]

03:17.351 --> 03:19.420
Ugh!

03:25.958 --> 03:27.260
Mmm.

03:27.293 --> 03:28.796
Mmm.

03:34.434 --> 03:35.769
[Sighs]

03:35.802 --> 03:37.671
Proud Of Yourself?

03:37.703 --> 03:39.439
I'm Sure He Didn't
Mean Any Harm, Tru.

03:39.472 --> 03:41.841
That's What
You Always Say.

03:41.874 --> 03:44.077
I Only Wanted
To Be Funny.

03:44.111 --> 03:46.547
Well, You Weren't, Ok?

03:46.579 --> 03:48.615
I Mean, I've Got, Like,
Big White Spots In Front Of My Eyes,

03:48.648 --> 03:51.017
And You Chased Away
My Friends, Eddie.

03:51.051 --> 03:52.920
Can You
Say You're Sorry, Honey?

03:54.654 --> 03:56.390
Sorry.

04:01.994 --> 04:04.130
Forgive Me, Tru?

04:06.232 --> 04:07.400
All Right.

04:07.434 --> 04:09.036
Good.

04:09.069 --> 04:10.603
Eddie, How About
You Go And Work

04:10.636 --> 04:12.205
On Your Map Project, Huh?

04:12.238 --> 04:14.507
It's In The Den.

04:19.745 --> 04:22.048
[Clears Throat]

04:22.081 --> 04:24.317
Why Do You
Have To Act Like This?

04:24.350 --> 04:26.720
Me? If I Shot A Flash
Off In His Eyes,

04:26.752 --> 04:28.288
You Would Ground Me
For A Month.

04:28.321 --> 04:29.456
Yeah, Because
You Know Better.

04:29.489 --> 04:30.491
So Does He.

04:30.523 --> 04:32.593
Mom, You Let Him Get
Away With Everything.

04:32.626 --> 04:34.929
Eddie Was Only Trying To Get Your Attention.

04:34.961 --> 04:36.095
He Feels Left Out

04:36.129 --> 04:37.631
When You're Here
With Your Friends.

04:37.663 --> 04:39.399
So Whatever He Does
Is Just Perfectly Fine,

04:39.432 --> 04:40.634
But I Can't
Do Anything Right?

04:40.667 --> 04:41.768
Is That What I Just Said?

04:41.802 --> 04:42.770
You Don't
Have To Say It.

04:42.802 --> 04:44.070
It's Totally
All Over Your Face.

04:44.104 --> 04:45.606
Tru.

04:44.104 --> 04:45.606
Forget It.

04:45.638 --> 04:47.141
Leave Me Alone.

05:03.489 --> 05:05.992
[Applause]

05:11.398 --> 05:12.633
Tru: Hi, Mom.

05:12.665 --> 05:14.134
Oh, Honey.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.636
I Don't Think
I've Had A Chance Today

05:15.669 --> 05:17.871
To Tell You How Very
Proud Of You I Am.

05:17.903 --> 05:19.239
Thanks, Mom.

05:20.374 --> 05:22.275
Seriously, Tru,

05:22.309 --> 05:25.112
You're Brilliant,
You're Adorable,

05:25.145 --> 05:27.715
And You Have The Best Taste In Clothes.

05:31.417 --> 05:32.518
Well, Then, Mom,

05:32.552 --> 05:34.455
I Think You And Dad
Should Increase My Allowance

05:34.487 --> 05:37.156
By $100 A Week.

05:37.189 --> 05:39.093
Sure.

05:57.276 --> 05:59.412
Ok, Here's The Deal.

05:59.446 --> 06:02.049
The More I Wish My Life
Could Be Like A Sitcom...

06:03.249 --> 06:05.251
The More It Turns
Into A Soap Opera.

06:05.285 --> 06:07.588
I Mean, I Can't
Really Even Talk To My Mom

06:07.621 --> 06:11.358
Because Not Only Does She
Totally Not Get Me,

06:11.391 --> 06:13.494
But She's Always So Busy
Dealing With Eddie.

06:13.526 --> 06:15.528
Then There's My Dad.

06:15.561 --> 06:19.266
Do You Know He Actually
Operates On People's Brains?

06:19.299 --> 06:21.769
Eww. That's How Gross?

06:21.802 --> 06:22.936
Ech.

06:22.968 --> 06:25.038
Anyway, He's
Hardly Ever Here,

06:25.071 --> 06:26.773
And Frankly,

06:26.807 --> 06:29.376
Sometimes I Think He
Likes It Better That Way.

06:32.112 --> 06:33.112
Anyway,

06:33.146 --> 06:34.614
Does It Seem
A Little Bit Psycho

06:34.648 --> 06:36.384
That I'm Keeping
This Video Journal?

06:37.984 --> 06:39.585
Not To Me.

06:39.619 --> 06:43.190
In Fact, Here's 101 Reasons
Why I'm Doing It.

06:43.222 --> 06:44.624
Reason One:

06:45.925 --> 06:48.928
When I'm Incredibly Famous
And Have My Own Show,

06:48.961 --> 06:50.263
I'll Put This Journal
Out On Video

06:50.297 --> 06:52.698
So Everybody Can See What
My Life Was Really Like.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.101
Reason 2...

06:55.302 --> 06:58.272
In Case Foreign Agents
Break In

06:58.304 --> 06:59.572
And Drain My Memory,

06:59.605 --> 07:02.509
I'll Still Have This Tape
As A Record Of My Life.

07:03.609 --> 07:05.479
Reason 3...
[Sighs]

07:06.646 --> 07:09.715
I Really,
Really Need Something

07:09.749 --> 07:14.321
That's Completely
And Privately Mine.

07:15.754 --> 07:17.156
Anyway, I Haven't
Actually Come Up

07:17.189 --> 07:19.326
With Reasons 4-101 Yet,

07:19.359 --> 07:21.295
But I Promise When I Do,

07:21.328 --> 07:23.030
I'll Get Back To You.

07:25.297 --> 07:29.903
Eddie:
Fork. Knife. Spoon.

07:29.936 --> 07:30.971
Is Dad Home Yet?

07:31.004 --> 07:32.506
No.

07:32.538 --> 07:36.175
One Of His Patients Had Some
Sort Of Post-Op Complication.

07:36.208 --> 07:39.579
Jeez. I Can't Even Imagine
Being A Surgeon Like He Is.

07:39.612 --> 07:41.180
That's Why We
Have To Be Really Mellow

07:41.213 --> 07:42.850
When He Gets Home.

07:42.883 --> 07:44.785
What's For Dinner?

07:44.818 --> 07:46.620
Chicken.

07:46.653 --> 07:47.987
Twice-Baked Potatoes,

07:48.021 --> 07:50.157
Broccoli.

07:53.559 --> 07:55.129
No, No, No.
Tru, We Need.

07:55.162 --> 07:56.463
No.

07:55.162 --> 07:56.463
We Need--
Yes, We Do.

07:56.496 --> 07:57.464
Eddie, We Don't
Need Those--

07:57.497 --> 07:58.465
We Do Need 'Em.

07:58.497 --> 07:59.465
Miss Tar
Said That's

07:59.499 --> 08:00.467
How You Set
The Table.

08:00.499 --> 08:01.968
But Tonight,
We Don't Need Them.

08:02.001 --> 08:04.037
Fork, Knife, Spoon.
We Need Them, Tru.

08:04.069 --> 08:05.304
Eddie, No.

08:04.069 --> 08:05.304
We Need Them.

08:05.338 --> 08:07.273
Hey, Let Him
Set The Table

08:07.307 --> 08:08.609
The Way He Wants, Ok?

08:08.641 --> 08:10.109
Mom, It's My Night
To Do The Dishes.

08:10.143 --> 08:11.445
I Don't Want To Have
To Wash Something

08:11.477 --> 08:12.545
That We're
Not Even Gonna Use.

08:12.578 --> 08:15.014
If It's Such A Big Deal,
I'll Do The Dishes.

08:15.047 --> 08:16.149
That's Not The Point.

08:16.182 --> 08:17.183
I Think The Point Is

08:17.217 --> 08:19.653
You Want To Argue
About Everything Today.

08:20.987 --> 08:22.689
You Know,
You're So Worried

08:22.722 --> 08:23.957
About Not Hurting
Eddie's Feelings

08:23.989 --> 08:26.593
That You Act Like I Don't Have Any Feelings At All.

08:32.566 --> 08:34.034
Note To Self:

08:34.067 --> 08:35.836
When I Do Make A Tv Show
Out Of My Life,

08:35.868 --> 08:39.005
Remind Me To Cast Somebody Else As My Mom.

08:44.910 --> 08:46.646
Reasons Why I Think
Eddie Might Be

08:46.679 --> 08:50.516
The Most Well-Adjusted One
In Our Entire Family:

08:50.549 --> 08:52.852
First, Eddie Would
Never Go Out Of The House

08:52.886 --> 08:54.221
Without Bothering
To Look In The Mirror...

08:54.253 --> 08:56.689
Like Some People I Know.

08:56.722 --> 08:58.559
And Then What About The Way

08:58.592 --> 08:59.660
She Always Has To Ask

08:59.693 --> 09:02.095
The World's Most
Embarrassing Questions?

09:02.127 --> 09:05.431
Excuse Me. Hi.

09:05.464 --> 09:07.900
Are These Tomatoes
Really Organic?

09:07.934 --> 09:09.903
Or Do You Just, Like,
Put The Sign Up There

09:09.935 --> 09:11.103
To, You Know,
Take Advantage

09:11.136 --> 09:14.141
Of Environmentally-Conscious
Women Like Myself?

09:15.809 --> 09:17.243
Tru: And You'd
Never Catch Eddie

09:17.276 --> 09:18.778
Packing Left-Over
Chinese Food

09:18.812 --> 09:20.113
And Chopsticks In My Lunch.

09:20.146 --> 09:21.214
Oh, Check Out The Note

09:21.247 --> 09:22.782
In Totally Fake
Chinese Writing

09:22.815 --> 09:25.418
That Has The Translation
On The Back.

09:25.452 --> 09:28.489
Could She Possibly Be
Any Cornier?

09:29.789 --> 09:30.790
I--I'm Really Serious.

09:30.823 --> 09:32.825
I Want To Know
If They're Organic Or Not.

09:40.467 --> 09:42.468
Tru And Everybody
Came Home,

09:42.501 --> 09:44.136
And I Was Really Funny.

09:44.170 --> 09:46.472
Paparazzi! Paparazzi!

09:46.506 --> 09:48.074
Remember, Tru,
When I Said It?

09:48.107 --> 09:49.108
Papa-Who?

09:49.141 --> 09:50.477
Tru: He's
Saying Paparazzi, Dad.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.646
You Know, Like
Celebrity Photographer.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.414
Paparazzi, Oh.
Paparazzi, That's Funny.

09:54.447 --> 09:56.783
That Was
Real Funny, Huh?

09:54.447 --> 09:56.783
Funny.

09:56.815 --> 09:58.117
It's Funny.
It's Funny.

09:58.150 --> 09:59.620
It Wasn't Funny.

09:59.652 --> 10:00.753
Mom, Could You Pass Me
The Broccoli, Please?

10:00.786 --> 10:02.122
Mm-Hmm.

10:03.323 --> 10:05.025
Thank You. Oh.

10:06.626 --> 10:09.161
Oh! Not Again!

10:09.194 --> 10:10.162
Mom: It's Ok, Honey.

10:10.195 --> 10:11.897
Sit Down. I Got It.

10:11.930 --> 10:13.299
It's Not As If We Can
Eat The Broccoli Now.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.669
It's All Covered
With Glass.

10:17.304 --> 10:18.271
I'm Sorry, Dad.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.274
[Sighs]

10:20.306 --> 10:22.008
Come Here.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.444
Come Here.

10:29.549 --> 10:30.650
Hey, You Know What?

10:30.684 --> 10:32.919
One Of These Days,

10:32.952 --> 10:34.154
We're Gonna Go Through
An Entire Meal

10:34.187 --> 10:36.957
Without Dropping
Or Breaking Anything.

10:36.990 --> 10:38.825
I Know
It's Gonna Happen.

10:38.857 --> 10:39.825
Right.

10:39.858 --> 10:42.161
Come On.
It's Ok. Sit Down.

10:55.308 --> 10:56.777
Tru: Did You Know
It's Fairly Common

10:56.809 --> 10:57.843
For Baby Sharks

10:57.876 --> 11:00.146
To Attack Each Other
In The Womb?

11:00.179 --> 11:03.183
It's True.
We Learned It In Science.

11:06.886 --> 11:09.055
[Shark Belches]

11:06.886 --> 11:09.055
Stop!

11:10.390 --> 11:11.857
Tru: What If Everything
That's Wrong With Eddie

11:11.891 --> 11:13.059
Is All My Fault?

11:13.093 --> 11:16.163
Mom Says It's Not True,
But How Does She Know?

11:17.163 --> 11:20.200
I Mean, I'm The Twin
Who Was Born First.

11:20.232 --> 11:21.200
Maybe Everything Would've
Been Different

11:21.233 --> 11:23.436
If I'd Let Eddie
Out Ahead Of Me.

11:33.011 --> 11:37.751
My Twin Brother Has
A Developmental Disability.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.753
Now That We're
Starting High School,

11:39.785 --> 11:42.021
I Think It Would Be
Really Cool

11:42.054 --> 11:44.190
If I Could Find Some Way

11:44.223 --> 11:46.258
To Make Him More Comfortable

11:46.291 --> 11:48.261
And Accepted In The World.

11:48.294 --> 11:52.598
If Anybody Has Any Ideas
On How To Help Him Out,

11:52.631 --> 11:55.167
I'd Really Appreciate
Hearing From You.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.769
Tru W.

12:50.323 --> 12:53.160
[Bell Rings]

12:58.964 --> 13:00.266
Tru: Can You Stand It?

13:00.299 --> 13:02.234
Billy Meyer And I
Totally Connected.

13:02.267 --> 13:03.436
He's, Like,
The Hottest Junior Ever,

13:03.469 --> 13:04.804
And I'm Just
A Lowly Freshman,

13:04.838 --> 13:06.807
But He Completely
Stopped To Talk To Me.

13:06.839 --> 13:08.174
What'd He Say?

13:08.208 --> 13:10.644
Hey, Kid, Is There
An Assembly Today?

13:15.982 --> 13:17.117
Wow.

13:17.150 --> 13:18.452
That Proves It.

13:18.485 --> 13:20.387
He Has To Be
In Love With You.

13:21.187 --> 13:22.856
It Means
He Knows I'm Alive.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.125
Hey, Guys,
I've Got The Dirt On Something

13:25.157 --> 13:27.126
You Are Definitely Gonna
Want To Hear About.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.795
I Hope It's Not
About Billy Meyer.

13:28.828 --> 13:29.829
What About Billy Meyer?

13:29.862 --> 13:31.797
Nothing.
She's Delirious.

13:31.830 --> 13:33.365
She Has No Idea
What She's Talking About.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.635
She's Right.
I'm A Total Buffoon.

13:35.668 --> 13:37.504
Aah! Don't Tell Me

13:37.536 --> 13:38.704
You're In Love
With That Jerk.

13:38.737 --> 13:40.339
I'm Not, Ok?

13:40.372 --> 13:41.307
Do You Have News,
Or Don't You?

13:41.341 --> 13:43.310
Well, What'll
You Give Me For It?

13:44.142 --> 13:45.511
Forget It.

13:45.545 --> 13:47.981
[Bell Rings]

13:48.014 --> 13:49.416
Hey, Where
Are You Going?

13:50.516 --> 13:51.484
Homeroom's This Way.

13:51.517 --> 13:52.952
Denise: Come Along, Jakey.

13:52.986 --> 13:55.389
Forgive Him.
He's New To The Planet.

14:25.017 --> 14:26.252
Aah!

14:27.554 --> 14:28.988
Sorry. Sorry.

14:29.021 --> 14:29.989
[Gasps]

14:30.022 --> 14:31.023
Sorry.

14:31.056 --> 14:32.224
[Laughs]

14:32.257 --> 14:34.460
My Bad. Sorry.

14:36.628 --> 14:38.464
Yeah. No Problem.

14:43.602 --> 14:46.073
Tru: Could I Be
A Bigger Freak?

14:47.439 --> 14:49.575
Tell You One Thing:

14:49.608 --> 14:51.444
If I Had Billy Meyer
For My Boyfriend,

14:51.477 --> 14:54.314
My Life Would Be Perfect.

14:56.882 --> 15:01.487
Tru-Cy, I'm Home!

15:08.962 --> 15:09.963
Hi, Honey.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.097
How Was Your Day?

15:11.130 --> 15:12.265
Terrible.

15:12.298 --> 15:13.934
I Got Fired From My Job,

15:13.967 --> 15:15.535
I Wrecked The Car,

15:15.568 --> 15:17.904
And We're A Week Late
On The Mortgage.

15:17.937 --> 15:20.407
Oh, Darling, How Awful.

15:20.439 --> 15:23.108
But Why All The Presents?

15:23.141 --> 15:25.545
As Long As I Have You
For My Sweetie,

15:25.578 --> 15:27.447
Nothing Can Get Me Down.

15:27.479 --> 15:28.848
All: Aww.

15:41.327 --> 15:42.295
Hey.

15:42.328 --> 15:44.665
Jake: Hey, Tru!

15:42.328 --> 15:44.665
Hey.

15:45.665 --> 15:46.867
Hi.

15:51.371 --> 15:52.572
Liverwurst.

15:52.604 --> 15:54.473
Eww.

15:58.011 --> 16:00.579
Hey, So, Remember
The News I Said I Had?

16:00.612 --> 16:02.082
How About We Trade?

16:02.115 --> 16:03.650
Info For Drumstick.

16:04.449 --> 16:06.352
Pass.

16:06.386 --> 16:07.621
Fine.

16:07.654 --> 16:09.255
Look, Aren't You The One

16:09.288 --> 16:11.791
Who's Always Babbling
About Being A Big Tv Star?

16:11.823 --> 16:13.626
Tru's Gonna Be
A Star.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.161
A Big,
Humongous Star.

16:16.194 --> 16:17.262
Yeah. Well,

16:17.295 --> 16:19.532
I Might Know A Way
You Can Make That Happen.

16:22.501 --> 16:24.536
Mom! Mom! Guess What?
It's A Miracle.

16:24.569 --> 16:26.472
It's The Chance
Of A Lifetime!

16:26.506 --> 16:30.110
Wtuv Is Having
A Contest For Kids,

16:30.142 --> 16:33.146
And The Winner Gets
To Host Their Own Tv Show.

16:33.179 --> 16:34.981

Comprehending This?

16:35.014 --> 16:37.017
I'm Gonna Be On Tv!

16:38.150 --> 16:39.118

A Few Hundred Entries.

16:40.719 --> 16:41.854
So?

16:41.887 --> 16:42.855
So I Don't Want You
To Be Devastated

16:42.889 --> 16:43.990
If You Don't Win.

16:44.022 --> 16:46.525
Nice Vote Of Confidence.
Thanks A Ton, Mom.

16:46.559 --> 16:48.461
Baby, I'm Only Trying
To Be Realistic.

16:48.493 --> 16:51.097
Well, I'd Rather
Have You Be Supportive.

16:55.233 --> 16:56.869
Well, It Sounds Great.

17:01.506 --> 17:04.678
Ok, Titles For
My Award-Winning Tv Show:

17:04.710 --> 17:07.413

17:25.263 --> 17:26.598
[Sighs]

17:26.631 --> 17:28.535
I Need To Keep Thinking.

17:32.037 --> 17:33.672
Teacher: Ok, Guys,
Write This Down.

17:33.706 --> 17:35.942
Essays On <I>The Pearl
Are Due On Friday.

17:35.975 --> 17:37.110
And By Monday,

17:37.142 --> 17:39.011
I Want To Hear The Titles
And The Authors

17:39.045 --> 17:42.448
For Your Next Book Report
So I Can Sign Off On Them.

17:42.481 --> 17:43.882
The Answer, Jake, Is No.

17:43.916 --> 17:46.119
Comic Books And Graphic
Novels Don't Count.

17:46.151 --> 17:48.054
[Laughter]

17:48.086 --> 17:49.288
What, You Didn't Know
I Was Psychic?

17:49.322 --> 17:51.123
[Bell Rings]

17:51.157 --> 17:53.093
All Right.
See Y'all Tomorrow.

18:05.138 --> 18:06.939
Mr. Taylor,

18:06.973 --> 18:08.608
I Told You About
The Wtuv Contest.

18:08.641 --> 18:09.609
[Chuckles]

18:09.641 --> 18:11.544
9 Or 10 Times
In The Last Few Days.

18:11.576 --> 18:13.145
Well, I'm Doomed.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.215
I Mean, I Really
Need Your Help,

18:15.247 --> 18:17.316
'Cause I Want To Do Something Original And Great,

18:17.350 --> 18:20.253
But Every Idea
I Come Up With Stinks.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.722
What Do I Tell You Guys
When You're Writing?

18:22.755 --> 18:23.823
Write What You Know.

18:23.855 --> 18:26.959
Right. So Why Not
Apply That Same Concept

18:26.993 --> 18:27.994
To Your Filmmaking?

18:28.026 --> 18:29.795
Forget About Being Clever.

18:29.829 --> 18:31.498
Go For Real.

18:49.148 --> 18:51.985
Ginny, I Got
The Photo Layout For You.

18:53.119 --> 18:54.286
Ginny?

18:54.320 --> 18:55.688
This Is Strange.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.989
What Is It?

18:57.023 --> 18:59.125
I Was Looking
For Some Information

18:59.158 --> 19:01.494
On Music Classes
For Eddie,

19:01.526 --> 19:04.463
And I Came Across A Posting That Tru Put Up.

19:04.497 --> 19:06.166
What Does She Want?

19:06.198 --> 19:08.433
Help For Her Brother.

19:08.467 --> 19:10.536
Really?

19:10.570 --> 19:11.604
A Way To Make Him

19:11.637 --> 19:14.174
Feel More Comfortable
In The World.

19:16.976 --> 19:17.977
You Know, It Used To Be

19:18.009 --> 19:19.945
When She Was Worried
About Stuff Like That,

19:19.978 --> 19:22.314
I Was The One That
She Came Running To.

19:22.348 --> 19:23.449
Not Anymore.

19:23.481 --> 19:26.351
Sweetie, When You
Were Her Age,

19:26.384 --> 19:28.720
How Often Did You
Confide In Your Mother?

19:28.754 --> 19:31.524
Never.

19:31.556 --> 19:32.958
You Know
This Is Different.

19:32.991 --> 19:36.895
I Mean, She And I Have
Always Been So Close.

19:36.929 --> 19:39.966
Now, It's...

19:39.998 --> 19:42.768
All She Ever Does
Is Yell At Me.

19:43.835 --> 19:46.705
Everything I Do Is
Either Stupid Or Wrong.

19:46.738 --> 19:48.842
I Have No Idea
When I Turned Into

19:48.874 --> 19:50.676
The Most Annoying Mom
On The Planet.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.411
She's 14.

19:52.445 --> 19:54.147
You're Lucky
She Hasn't Moved Out

19:54.179 --> 19:55.681
Or Gotten Her Own Apartment.

19:55.715 --> 19:56.683
Yet.

19:56.716 --> 19:57.918
Mm-Hmm.

20:15.968 --> 20:17.836
You Know What Sucks?

20:17.870 --> 20:19.439
Don't Use That Word.

20:19.471 --> 20:21.373
It Sounds Awful.

20:21.407 --> 20:23.509
Do You Know What Stinks?

20:23.542 --> 20:24.878
Having A Boy For A Twin

20:24.910 --> 20:27.080
Means I'll Never
Get To Do Cool Stuff.

20:27.112 --> 20:28.981
You Know,
Like In <I>The Parent Trap?

20:29.814 --> 20:31.516
We Could Never Swap Dates

20:31.550 --> 20:33.286
Or Take Tests
For Each Other.

20:33.318 --> 20:35.220
We Can't Even
Fool You And Dad.

20:35.254 --> 20:38.057
What's The Point
Of Even Having A Twin?

20:38.090 --> 20:39.058
Shouldn't You Be Focused

20:39.091 --> 20:40.560
On Finishing
Your Homework?

20:40.593 --> 20:42.428
Ugh. Don't You Care
That I'm Being, Like,

20:42.460 --> 20:44.096
Incredibly Profound Here?

20:44.130 --> 20:45.364
Eddie: Look At Me.

20:45.398 --> 20:46.532
I'm A Doctor Like Daddy.

20:46.564 --> 20:48.534
Hey.

20:48.566 --> 20:49.701
Want To See Me
Do An Operation?

20:49.735 --> 20:51.237
We'd Love To.

20:53.072 --> 20:55.742
Uh-Oh. Broken Brain.

20:55.775 --> 20:56.743
[Gasps]

20:56.775 --> 20:58.044
Paging Doctor Eddie.

20:58.076 --> 21:01.079
Paging Doctor Eddie.

21:01.112 --> 21:02.381
Eddie: Broken Brain.

21:02.414 --> 21:04.650
That Sounds Serious,
Doctor.

21:04.683 --> 21:07.319
Shh. I'll Make You
All Better.

21:07.352 --> 21:08.420
[Tru Screams]

21:08.454 --> 21:10.123
Ow! No, Doctor!
You're Hurting Me.

21:10.156 --> 21:11.457
Aah!

21:11.489 --> 21:12.592
Rrr. Rrr. Rrr.

21:12.624 --> 21:14.827
[Imitating Drill]

21:18.831 --> 21:20.065
Aah!

21:20.099 --> 21:21.701
Dad: What's
Going On Here?

21:24.602 --> 21:26.640
I, Um...

21:27.439 --> 21:28.507
Eddie: I...

21:28.541 --> 21:30.643
It's All Right,
Eddie. It's Ok.

21:30.676 --> 21:33.813
He Was Performing A Very Delicate Operation.

21:34.679 --> 21:36.949
Eddie, Those Tools
Are Antiques.

21:36.983 --> 21:38.484
They Were A Gift
From My Father.

21:38.516 --> 21:40.253
When Did We Decide
They Were Toys?

21:40.285 --> 21:43.689
Mom: He's Being Careful.

21:43.723 --> 21:45.625
I'm Not A Doctor.

21:45.658 --> 21:48.328
Doctors Are Mean.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.834
Dad: I Don't Know
What You Want From Me.

21:55.868 --> 21:58.104
It's Like Everything I Do With This Kid Is Wrong.

21:58.137 --> 21:59.472
It's All About Your Tone.

21:59.505 --> 22:00.473
Tone.

22:00.506 --> 22:02.275
You Scare Him.
You Intimidate Him.

22:02.307 --> 22:05.644
Well, At Least
I Don't Baby Him.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.985
I Give Him Help
When He Needs Help.

22:12.752 --> 22:14.721
Look...

22:14.754 --> 22:16.456
Unless We Start
Raising The Bar,

22:16.488 --> 22:18.357
How Can We Expect Him
To Jump Any Higher?

22:18.391 --> 22:20.192
This May Be It, Bob.

22:20.226 --> 22:22.128
No, I Will
Not Accept That.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.330
Each Of These Kids
Is Different.

22:24.362 --> 22:26.732
There's No Rule Book.
There's No Handbook.

22:26.766 --> 22:28.066
If We Get Lazy

22:28.100 --> 22:29.468
And Quit Pushing Him,

22:29.502 --> 22:31.004
He's Liable
To Stop Growing

22:31.036 --> 22:32.037
Simply Because
We Let Him.

22:32.071 --> 22:33.539
Yeah, But He's
Already Gone

22:33.572 --> 22:35.574
Way Beyond
People's Expectations.

22:35.608 --> 22:38.177
Nobody Thought He'd End Up
In A Mainstream School.

22:38.209 --> 22:40.712
Exactly, So Why Not
Rewrite All The Rules?

22:40.746 --> 22:42.748
As Long As We Don't
Lose Sight Of Reality.

22:42.782 --> 22:45.352
Do You Happen To Remember What I Do For A Living?

22:46.518 --> 22:48.020
I Face More Reality
Every Single Day

22:48.054 --> 22:49.988
Than Most People Have
To Face In A Lifetime,

22:50.022 --> 22:51.591
So I'd Really
Appreciate It

22:51.623 --> 22:52.758
If You Didn't Lecture Me

22:52.792 --> 22:56.730
On Coming To Grips With
My Son's Limitations.

23:25.323 --> 23:26.959

Oh...

35:14.699 --> 35:16.468
Are You Guys Ready
For This?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.636
The Only Condition Is That You

35:18.669 --> 35:20.605
I Want To Know Every Single Thing You Think.

35:20.638 --> 35:23.942
Don't Worry.
Brutal Honesty Is Our Specialty.

Hi.

35:35.654 --> 35:37.956
Tru: Welcome
To A Fantastic Journey

35:37.989 --> 35:39.858
Inside The Brain
Of Eddie Walker...

35:39.890 --> 35:41.192
Whoo!

35:41.225 --> 35:42.861
Tru: The Brain
Is The Most Complex

35:42.893 --> 35:45.531
And Mysterious Organ
In The Human Body.

35:45.564 --> 35:49.134
It Controls All The Bodily Functions That Keep Us Alive.

35:49.167 --> 35:52.203
But More Importantly,
It Defines Who We Are...

35:52.236 --> 35:53.939
The Nervous System
Is Composed

35:53.971 --> 35:56.140
One, Of A Series
Of Large Centers

35:56.174 --> 35:59.277
Of Nerve Matter Called, Collectively,
The Cerebro-Spinal Centers.

35:59.310 --> 36:03.147
2, Of Smaller Centers:
Ganglia.

36:03.181 --> 36:06.451
3, Of Nerves Connected.
Either At The Cerebrum...

36:06.484 --> 36:08.620
Of Certain Modifications
Of The Peripheral Terminations

36:08.652 --> 36:10.622
Of The Nerves
Forming The Organs

36:10.654 --> 36:12.824
Of The External Senses.

36:12.857 --> 36:15.193
The Cerebro-Spinal Axis
Consists Of The Brain...

36:15.227 --> 36:18.297
Which Are Contained Within The Skull And Spinal Canal.

36:18.330 --> 36:21.065
The Brain
And Its Memories...

36:21.098 --> 36:23.968
...Which Lines
The Interior Of The Skull.

36:24.002 --> 36:26.705
Its Outer Surface
Is Rough And Fibrillated,

36:26.737 --> 36:29.341
And Adheres Closely To The
Inner Surface Of The Bones,

36:29.373 --> 36:32.544
Forming Their Internal
Periosteum.

36:32.576 --> 36:36.013
This Adhesion Being Most
Marked Opposite The Sutures

36:36.047 --> 36:37.482
And At The Base
Of The Skull.

...Sent Inward Into
The Cavity Of The Skull

36:40.752 --> 36:42.387
Are 4 In Number...

36:42.419 --> 36:45.189
Well, Folks,
There You Have It.

36:45.223 --> 36:47.826

Into The Very Unique Mind

36:47.859 --> 36:49.094
Of Eddie Walker.

36:49.127 --> 36:50.762
I Hope It's
Been Enlightening.

36:50.794 --> 36:54.999
For Wtuv,
This Is Trudy Walker.

36:55.033 --> 36:56.268
[Sighs]

36:56.301 --> 36:58.571
So, What'd You Think?

37:00.772 --> 37:01.873
What?

37:01.906 --> 37:03.841
Uh, Well...

37:03.875 --> 37:05.110
I Said I Wanted Honesty.

37:05.143 --> 37:07.880
I Definitely
Learned A Lot.

37:07.913 --> 37:09.748
And The Music
Was Good.

37:09.781 --> 37:11.183
You Hated It.

37:11.216 --> 37:14.085
No, It's Just, Uh...

37:14.118 --> 37:15.519
What's The Word?

37:15.553 --> 37:17.122
Boring?

37:15.553 --> 37:17.122
Yeah.

37:17.154 --> 37:19.457
You're Right.
It Stinks.

37:19.491 --> 37:21.093
You Wanted
Truth, Right?

37:21.125 --> 37:23.294
Yeah, Right.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.464
But Maybe We're Not The Only
People You Should Be Asking.

37:25.497 --> 37:27.466
I Mean,
It's A Medical Show.

37:27.498 --> 37:29.968
Maybe You Need
A Second Opinion.

37:33.971 --> 37:35.240
Good Job, Tru.

37:38.609 --> 37:40.178
[Door Closes]

37:46.650 --> 37:48.319
Boring?

37:48.353 --> 37:50.122
Well...

37:50.154 --> 37:52.823
It May Not Be
Everyone's Cup Of Tea.

37:52.857 --> 37:55.127
A Cliche?
Thanks, Mom.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.328
That's Exactly What
I Needed To Hear.

37:57.361 --> 37:59.997
I Think The Problem Might Be That You Played It Safe.

38:00.031 --> 38:03.101
I Want To Know Where
You Are In All This.

38:03.134 --> 38:04.803
I'm Doing Most
Of The Filming.

38:04.835 --> 38:05.971
That's Where I Am.

38:06.004 --> 38:08.739
I Don't Mean Physically.
I Mean Emotionally.

38:08.772 --> 38:10.641
What Are You
Talking About?

38:10.674 --> 38:11.977
I Think It'd Be
Much More Interesting

38:12.009 --> 38:13.344
From Your Point Of View.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.247
Stop. I Get It.

38:15.279 --> 38:16.982
You Hated It.
I'm A Total Failure.

38:17.015 --> 38:19.350
Thank You.
Let's Just Drop It.

Think My Show

Did You?

39:11.870 --> 39:13.904
It Needs
More Car Crashes.

39:15.607 --> 39:17.042
You're Right.

What If This Means
I Don't Have Any Talent?

39:22.413 --> 39:24.982
I Mean, What If I Spent
All This Time Thinking

39:25.015 --> 39:27.218
That I Was Born
To Have My Own Show,

39:27.252 --> 39:30.255
And It Turns Out
I'm A Talentless,

39:30.288 --> 39:33.125

No.

Of Course Not. Why?

39:57.482 --> 39:59.618
'Cause, Um...

39:59.650 --> 40:02.821

With Me Anymore.

01:01:41.718 --> 01:01:42.685
You Wouldn't
Be Allowed

01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:45.256
To Rollerblade
In The House...

01:01:49.525 --> 01:01:53.397
And You Wouldn't Be
The Amazing Brother

01:01:53.429 --> 01:01:55.466
That I Love.

01:01:57.033 --> 01:01:58.902
You Mean It?

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.643
What's Wrong, Tru,
I Make You Sad Now?

01:02:08.377 --> 01:02:10.213
What's Wrong, Tru?

01:02:11.948 --> 01:02:13.951
Nothing.

01:02:15.752 --> 01:02:17.554
Blow.

01:02:17.587 --> 01:02:19.256
[Sniffs]

01:02:27.663 --> 01:02:29.766
I Love You, Tru.

01:02:29.799 --> 01:02:32.803
I Love You, Too, Eddie.

01:02:38.808 --> 01:02:41.644
Tru: Right When Eddie
Was Melting Down,

01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:45.149
I Was Mad That I Didn't Have My Video Camera.

01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:47.618
Is That Awful?

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.886
You Know, Sweetie,

01:02:48.919 --> 01:02:50.788
Don't Be So Hard
On Yourself.

01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:53.290
You're Only A Mere
Mortal, After All.

01:02:55.357 --> 01:02:57.294
Get Some Sleep, Ok?

01:02:57.326 --> 01:02:58.529
Yeah.

01:03:12.843 --> 01:03:15.178
Eddie: Hi, Mom.
We're Home!

01:03:15.212 --> 01:03:16.447

Hang On. I'm Almost
Finished Here.

01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:23.053
Tru, There's A Letter
For You By The Phone.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.129
Oh, No. This Is It.

01:03:33.163 --> 01:03:35.966
It's From The Tv Station.

01:03:35.998 --> 01:03:37.701
Mom, Did She Win
The Contest?

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:39.069
I Don't Know.

01:03:50.513 --> 01:03:53.216
I Did It. I Won.

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.919
She Won?

01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:58.189
I Knew You Could Do It.

01:04:00.056 --> 01:04:01.992
You Know, If Kids
Start Making Fun Of Me

01:04:02.024 --> 01:04:04.126
For All The Personal Stuff
I Showed,

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.163

01:05:12.495 --> 01:05:15.531
I Might
Actually Throw Up.

01:05:15.565 --> 01:05:16.600
Where Is Dad?

01:05:16.632 --> 01:05:18.301
Did He Not Swear That He Would Be Here?

01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:20.437

Listen, I'm Running Late.

01:05:46.929 --> 01:05:48.498
My Patient
Just Got Into Recovery.

01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:49.498
I Have To Check On Him,

01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:51.167
I Have To

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.636

Tru: Whoo Whoo Whoo
Whoo Whoo Whoo!

01:07:19.522 --> 01:07:20.891
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:26.095
Eddie Is The Most Beautiful

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:28.098
And Profound Person I Know.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:30.100
Eddie: Wow.

01:07:30.132 --> 01:07:32.268
Wow. Look At That!

01:07:32.301 --> 01:07:36.272
Ew. It's A Gross,
Disgusting Spiderweb.

01:07:36.306 --> 01:07:38.508
No. Uh-Uh.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.045
It's Perfect And
Beautiful And Strong.

01:07:46.815 --> 01:07:48.118
Ginny: To The Side.

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:50.587
Tru: You Guys
Are Doing Great.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.755
Certainly Are. Ok...

01:07:51.788 --> 01:07:53.056
There I Am,

01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:54.324
In All My Glory.

01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:57.393
That's Ok.

01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:57.393
Eddie: Oops. Sorry, Mom.

01:07:57.426 --> 01:07:59.829
Everybody Makes Mistakes.

01:08:00.897 --> 01:08:03.167
Yeah, E-E-E-Except God,
Though, Right, Mom?

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.303
'Cause If God
Makes Mistakes,

01:08:06.335 --> 01:08:09.605
Then The Whole World Will
Look Like A Kid Drew It, Right?

01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:10.907
Right?

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.712
If An Athlete
Gets Athlete's Foot,

01:08:16.745 --> 01:08:19.749
What Does An Astronaut Get?

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:23.886
Give Up. What?

01:08:23.919 --> 01:08:25.823
Missile Toe.

01:08:28.158 --> 01:08:30.828
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

01:08:35.531 --> 01:08:37.966
But Living With A Twin
Who Has A Mental Disability

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.770
Isn't Always
The Easiest Thing.

01:08:43.173 --> 01:08:45.475
Eddie, Put My Camera Down.

01:08:45.508 --> 01:08:47.144
Come Here. That's Mine.

01:08:45.508 --> 01:08:47.144

01:08:47.176 --> 01:08:48.645
Give It To Me Now.

01:08:48.676 --> 01:08:50.247
Eddie, Put It Back, Eddie.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.115

01:08:54.517 --> 01:08:55.786

01:08:54.517 --> 01:08:55.786
Is This Gonna
Be Everything Or--

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:57.154
No. The Candy, Too.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:57.154
No. We Are Done.
Thank You.

01:08:57.185 --> 01:08:58.622

01:08:58.654 --> 01:09:01.457

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:07.263
Turn Off The Camera!

01:09:07.296 --> 01:09:08.365
Let's Get The Candy, Tru!

01:09:07.296 --> 01:09:08.365
Clerk: Give Him
The Candy!

01:09:08.397 --> 01:09:11.801
Let's Get The Candy!

01:09:08.397 --> 01:09:11.801
I've Got A Line.

01:09:11.834 --> 01:09:12.801
When Eddie Acts Like This,

01:09:12.835 --> 01:09:14.435
I Know What
Everybody's Thinking.

01:09:14.469 --> 01:09:17.140
How Could
You Live With Him?

01:09:17.173 --> 01:09:19.209
Eddie: Stay Up!

01:09:19.241 --> 01:09:21.210
Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:22.444
Stay Up!

01:09:22.477 --> 01:09:23.779
Please.

01:09:23.812 --> 01:09:26.015
Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:31.487
Stupid.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.156
Stupid.

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:35.524
Stupid! Kite's Stupid.
[Sobs]

01:09:35.557 --> 01:09:38.328
Stupid Kite.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:40.930
It Must Be Retarded.

01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:45.134
Tru: I Was Gonna Go See <I>Toy
Story 2 With Some Friends,

01:09:45.167 --> 01:09:46.236
And Eddie Went--

01:09:46.268 --> 01:09:48.537
I Mean, Combustible.

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:52.508
Kicking, Screaming,
Flinging Himself On The Floor...

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:56.812
And I Makes Me
Really Embarrassed

01:09:56.846 --> 01:09:58.315
That He's My Brother.

01:09:58.347 --> 01:10:00.516
[Whispers]
It's All Right.

01:10:03.052 --> 01:10:05.422
I Just Wish Other People
Would Take The Time

01:10:05.454 --> 01:10:07.423
To Get To Know Him
The Way That I Do.

01:10:10.692 --> 01:10:13.396
Eddie: Hey, Tru. Hey.
Want An Apple?

01:10:13.428 --> 01:10:15.198
Hey, Are You Sure?

01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:19.402
If--If You Want One, Tru,
Um, It's Right Here, Ok?

01:10:19.435 --> 01:10:21.103
Right There.

01:10:21.137 --> 01:10:24.007
If You Ever Think You Ought To Feel Sorry For Eddie...

01:10:24.039 --> 01:10:25.107
Don't.

01:10:25.141 --> 01:10:27.210
Because
He's Got More Joy

01:10:27.243 --> 01:10:29.580
Than Almost
Any Other Kid I Know.

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:32.716
And Don't Feel Sorry
For Me, Either,

01:10:32.749 --> 01:10:34.551
Because I've
Got A Brother

01:10:34.584 --> 01:10:36.219
Who, Every Single Day,

01:10:36.252 --> 01:10:38.321
Teaches Me What's
Important In Life.

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:53.136
Â™ª I've Been Waiting
The Longest Time â™ª

01:10:53.168 --> 01:10:58.374

â™ª I Find A Secret World â™ª

01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:19.728
â™ª In Your Eyes... â™ª

01:11:19.762 --> 01:11:20.630
Hi!

01:11:20.663 --> 01:11:26.636
Â™ª There Lies
A Secret World â™ª

01:11:26.668 --> 01:11:29.305
â™ª And Everything
Feels Right â™ª

01:11:29.338 --> 01:11:31.674
â™ª When We're Safe Inside

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:36.346
â™ª Of Our Secret World â™ª

01:11:42.351 --> 01:11:43.619
Wow.

01:11:43.652 --> 01:11:46.122
That Was Great.

01:11:46.155 --> 01:11:47.691
You're Gonna Be A Star.

01:11:49.158 --> 01:11:51.328
Big Humongous Star, Tru.

01:11:56.531 --> 01:11:58.500
Pretty Impressive.

01:11:58.534 --> 01:11:59.869
[Softly]
Yeah.

01:11:59.901 --> 01:12:02.972
Where Are You?

01:12:03.006 --> 01:12:04.341
You Noticed, Huh?

01:12:04.374 --> 01:12:06.109
Oh, Yeah.

01:12:06.142 --> 01:12:08.311
Hazards Of
The Medical Life.

01:12:08.343 --> 01:12:09.645
Mmm.

01:12:09.678 --> 01:12:12.781
We All Become
Invisible Fathers.

01:12:12.815 --> 01:12:16.018
Yeah. Some Of Us
More Than Others.

01:12:17.152 --> 01:12:20.190
Wow. I Don't Believe It.

01:12:20.222 --> 01:12:21.824
I Mean,
You Were So Out There.

01:12:21.857 --> 01:12:24.828
Wasn't It Scary To Do?

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.064
Yeah.
I Wonder What All The Other Kids Are Gonna Think.

01:12:28.097 --> 01:12:30.567
Who Knows?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.502
Her Opinions Were Dumb,

01:12:32.534 --> 01:12:34.069
All The Images
Were ClichÃ©s,

01:12:34.102 --> 01:12:37.373
And Her Wardrobe Was,
Like, Completely The Worst.

01:12:37.406 --> 01:12:39.008
If I Were Tru,

01:12:39.042 --> 01:12:41.177
I'd Drop Out Of School
And Move To Siberia.

01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:43.579
It Would Have Been
Much More Effective

01:12:43.612 --> 01:12:46.082
If She'd Done The Entire
Program In Spanish.

01:12:46.115 --> 01:12:47.484
Of Course,
She Could Never Stay Awake

01:12:47.517 --> 01:12:49.419
Long Enough In My Class
To Learn.

01:12:49.451 --> 01:12:53.155
A Whole 1/2 Hour
Of The Retard Twins?

01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:55.557
Pass-Adena.

01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:59.529
[Bell Rings]

01:13:10.106 --> 01:13:11.408
I Saw Your Show, Tru.

01:13:11.441 --> 01:13:12.742
It Was Fantastic.

01:13:12.775 --> 01:13:13.843
Thanks.

01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:16.612
Hey, Tru. Nice Job.
Really Impressive.

01:13:16.646 --> 01:13:17.714
Wow. Thanks.

01:13:17.747 --> 01:13:19.982
My Mom Cried
Through The Whole Thing.

01:13:21.817 --> 01:13:24.053
Hey, Tru. Hey.

01:13:24.087 --> 01:13:26.490
[Applause]

01:13:51.814 --> 01:13:52.781
Hi, Dad.

01:13:52.815 --> 01:13:53.783
Hey, Tru.

01:13:53.816 --> 01:13:55.718
Hey, Tru, Come In Here
A Second, Willya?

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.987
I Want To Talk To You.

01:13:59.622 --> 01:14:02.292
Ok, I Watched
Your Show Again.

01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:05.628
But If People Were Only Paying Casual Attention,

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:08.198
I'm Not Sure They'd Even
Know You Have A Dad.

01:14:09.432 --> 01:14:11.968
Sorry. I Tried
To Put You In More.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.969
But...

01:14:15.137 --> 01:14:17.207
Come On. What Happened?
Tell Me. I Can Handle It.

01:14:19.976 --> 01:14:21.143
It's...

01:14:21.177 --> 01:14:23.179
If I'd Used All
The Stuff I'd Shot,

01:14:23.212 --> 01:14:24.948
I Know You Would
Have Been Really Mad.

01:14:24.981 --> 01:14:26.783
Oh, Come On.

01:14:26.816 --> 01:14:29.553
Well, I Think You Have
To Show Me, Then.

01:14:32.687 --> 01:14:34.690
You Know, We Really
Don't Have To Do This.

01:14:34.723 --> 01:14:36.025
Why? What Are
You Afraid Of?

01:14:36.057 --> 01:14:37.793
Hurting Your Feelings.

01:14:37.826 --> 01:14:39.161
Ha Ha Ha.

01:14:39.195 --> 01:14:41.465
What'd You Do,
Draw Devil Horns On Me Or Something?

01:14:42.464 --> 01:14:43.466
Come On.

01:14:43.499 --> 01:14:45.468
Let's Let The Footage
Speak For Itself.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.803
[Whimpers]

01:14:59.682 --> 01:15:00.884
[Beep Beep]

01:15:02.517 --> 01:15:05.187
Bob: That Was Something
I Really Liked.

01:15:06.856 --> 01:15:09.459
Aah! Unbelievable!

01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:11.960
We Can't Even
Get Through A Meal!

01:15:11.994 --> 01:15:13.597
Sorry.

01:15:16.566 --> 01:15:18.835
Ok. I Lost My Temper.

01:15:18.868 --> 01:15:20.837
That Happens.
What Am I, Perfect?

01:15:20.869 --> 01:15:24.239
Come On. What Else?

01:15:24.272 --> 01:15:25.341
[Beep]

01:15:25.374 --> 01:15:28.178
Eddie: Dad! Dad, Monkey Man!

01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:29.378
He's Gonna Get Me, Dad!

01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:30.379
Come On,
Come On, Come On!

01:15:30.413 --> 01:15:31.580
Does It Look
Like I'm Working?

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.816
Dad!

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.816
I'm Working Here!

01:15:33.848 --> 01:15:35.150
What Do I Have To Do To Make It Clear To You?

01:15:35.183 --> 01:15:36.252
Come On--Out!

01:15:36.284 --> 01:15:38.253
Let's Go. Out. Out.

01:15:36.284 --> 01:15:38.253
Sorry.

01:15:38.286 --> 01:15:39.321
What Are You Do--
Are You Filming This?

01:15:39.355 --> 01:15:41.191
Turn The Camera Off.

01:15:44.293 --> 01:15:46.362
Hi. It's Dr. Walker.
You Paged Me?

01:15:46.395 --> 01:15:47.564
Eddie! Stop It!

01:15:47.597 --> 01:15:49.199
Can't You See
I'm On The Phone?!

01:15:49.231 --> 01:15:51.167
[Sighs]
I'm Working Now!

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.803
Can I Just Get
5 Minutes To Myself?

01:15:55.704 --> 01:15:59.042
Oh, For--Eddie,
What Is This Mess?!

01:15:59.075 --> 01:16:01.010
Eddie, Pick Up
Your Clothes.

01:16:01.043 --> 01:16:02.078
How Many Times
Have I Told You

01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:04.247
Not To Throw Your
Clothes On The Floor?

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:08.951
It's All Like This?

01:16:08.985 --> 01:16:11.286
Pretty Much.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.822
Or Else
You Weren't There.

01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:15.725
[Beep]

01:16:17.392 --> 01:16:18.694
[Sighs]

01:16:18.727 --> 01:16:21.730
Dad, Your Job
Is Really Hard.

01:16:21.763 --> 01:16:23.266
You're Under
A Lot Of Stress.

01:16:23.298 --> 01:16:24.633
Eddie And I
Know That.

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.134
We Totally Get It.

01:16:26.168 --> 01:16:27.971
That's No Excuse.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.308
You Deserve
Better Than This.

01:16:33.976 --> 01:16:37.614
Ohh. What Do I Do Now?

01:16:37.646 --> 01:16:41.116
Honey, I Had No Idea.

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:42.819
I Mean, Who <I>Is That Guy?

01:16:43.753 --> 01:16:44.754
Dad...

01:16:44.786 --> 01:16:47.923
Eddie Loves Us
No Matter What--

01:16:47.957 --> 01:16:50.093
Even When
We Make Mistakes.

01:16:51.092 --> 01:16:52.628
You And Me And Mom,

01:16:52.661 --> 01:16:54.963
We're His
Entire World.

01:16:54.997 --> 01:16:58.368
He Just... Loves Us.

01:16:59.802 --> 01:17:02.304
Maybe All We Have To
Do Is Love Him Back.

01:17:02.338 --> 01:17:04.507
[Whispers]
All Right.

01:17:10.346 --> 01:17:11.513
One Click,

01:17:11.547 --> 01:17:13.182
It's All In
The Recycle Bin.

01:17:13.214 --> 01:17:16.285
Naw. Save It.

01:17:16.319 --> 01:17:18.855
You Might Need It
To Keep Me In Line.

01:17:28.396 --> 01:17:30.299
[Beep Beep]

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:33.002
Note To Self: When I Do Make
A Tv Show Out Of My Life,

01:17:33.034 --> 01:17:36.238
Remind Me To Cast
Somebody Else As My Mom.

01:18:20.682 --> 01:18:23.485
You Know, You Never
Had To Be Deedee.

01:18:23.518 --> 01:18:26.789
All You Had To Do
Was Talk To Me.

01:18:28.524 --> 01:18:31.061
You Make It Sound
So Easy.

01:18:42.637 --> 01:18:44.106
You Know, It Wasn't
That Long Ago

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.375
You Used To Tell Me
Everything.

01:18:47.442 --> 01:18:49.878
Sometimes More Than
I Wanted To Hear.

01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:55.351
Just Because
I Don't Tell You

01:18:55.383 --> 01:18:58.788
Every Intimate
Detail Of My Life,

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.289
It Doesn't Mean That
I Don't Love You.

01:19:01.323 --> 01:19:03.927
I Never Thought
You Didn't Love Me.

01:19:05.895 --> 01:19:07.664
I Just Missed You.

01:19:14.837 --> 01:19:17.574
When I Was Making
My Movie...

01:19:18.507 --> 01:19:20.476
Watching It Over
And Over Again,

01:19:20.508 --> 01:19:23.078
It Really Hit Me.

01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:26.615
You Know How
For So Long,

01:19:26.649 --> 01:19:29.919
Eddie And I Weren't Ever Really The Same,

01:19:29.951 --> 01:19:33.623
But, You Know,
We Played Monkey Man

01:19:33.655 --> 01:19:36.625
And We Went Out
For Soccer Together

01:19:36.659 --> 01:19:38.127
And We
Goofed Around.

01:19:38.159 --> 01:19:40.329
You Grew Up Together.

01:19:42.865 --> 01:19:46.769
Only Now,
I'll Go To College

01:19:46.802 --> 01:19:49.272
And Probably
Get Married

01:19:49.304 --> 01:19:52.275
And Have Kids...

01:19:52.307 --> 01:19:55.777
And Eddie'll
Always...

01:19:55.811 --> 01:19:58.181
Stay Eddie.

01:20:04.119 --> 01:20:06.522
Oh, My Girl.

01:20:06.554 --> 01:20:09.892
[Sobbing]

01:20:14.029 --> 01:20:17.165
Tru: So My Life
Isn't A Tv Show.

01:20:17.199 --> 01:20:18.668
I'll Survive.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.802
I Mean,
Just Because In Real Life,

01:20:20.835 --> 01:20:23.138
Things Don't Get
Wrapped Up Nice And Tidy,

01:20:23.172 --> 01:20:25.308
It Doesn't Mean
They Can't Improve.

01:20:27.008 --> 01:20:29.745
Dad Is Making An Effort
To Be Around More.

01:20:30.713 --> 01:20:33.883
And He's Trying
Really Hard To Relax.

01:20:33.915 --> 01:20:37.520
Don't Let It Go.
Don't, Don't Don't!

01:20:37.552 --> 01:20:39.555
I Said Trying.

01:20:40.756 --> 01:20:42.691
I Mean,
To Quote A Mom ClichÃ©,

01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:44.694
"Rome Wasn't Built
In A Day."

01:20:47.695 --> 01:20:50.365
And Mom Has Promised
To Be More Available,

01:20:50.399 --> 01:20:52.802
So We Can Talk And Stuff.

01:20:52.834 --> 01:20:55.404
And, Yes, I Promise
To Actually Listen

01:20:55.436 --> 01:20:57.439
And Be Open With Her.

01:20:59.408 --> 01:21:02.812
And Eddie... Well, I Think
It's Safe To Say

01:21:02.844 --> 01:21:06.716
That Eddie Will Always Be
Eddie.

01:21:09.284 --> 01:21:10.852
Come On, Mom.

01:21:09.284 --> 01:21:10.852
I Can't.

01:21:10.886 --> 01:21:12.021
Eddie: Play
With Me, Mom.

01:21:12.053 --> 01:21:13.388
No, I--

01:21:12.053 --> 01:21:13.388
I'll Play With You,
Eddie.

01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:17.326
Eddie: Ok, Tru.
We're Gonna Play Tag.

01:21:17.359 --> 01:21:18.660
Tru: Go Eddie!

01:21:18.694 --> 01:21:20.696
[All Cheer]

01:21:23.632 --> 01:21:25.067
Eddie, Come On,

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.270
We've Watched The Scene,
Like, 10 Times.

01:21:27.302 --> 01:21:28.603
Let's Move On.

01:21:28.637 --> 01:21:31.407
It's Not Like
It's Gonna Change.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.174
I--I Like It.

01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:35.777
I Don't Want It
To Change.

01:21:41.283 --> 01:21:43.953
It's You And Me...

01:21:43.985 --> 01:21:46.321
Being Twins.
