00:03.231 --> 00:04.731
All right, one more.

00:04.731 --> 00:06.895
One more, look at me and uh...

00:06.895 --> 00:08.923
Big smiles. Ah, that's perfect.

00:08.923 --> 00:09.836
Yes, okay.

00:09.836 --> 00:11.855
Um, we're gonna get a group shot.

00:11.855 --> 00:14.296
So I need you guys to come in with me.

00:14.296 --> 00:19.162
Uh, I need the bridesmaids
and the best men, please.

00:19.162 --> 00:20.596
All right.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.058
Excuse me.

00:23.058 --> 00:24.636
You're late.

00:24.636 --> 00:26.587
Do you have it?

00:26.587 --> 00:28.146
All of it?

00:28.146 --> 00:29.524
Good.

00:29.524 --> 00:31.901
Shall we do this in the usual way?

00:32.421 --> 00:33.309
Yeah, yeah.

00:33.309 --> 00:35.984
Hotel spa will be fine.

00:36.124 --> 00:38.919
Five minutes.
Yeah, five minutes.

01:13.598 --> 01:15.071
What?

01:15.501 --> 01:16.892
No, this isn't...

01:17.889 --> 01:19.524
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:19.524 --> 01:21.057
You think you can screw with me?

01:21.057 --> 01:23.294
My price just went up.

01:23.294 --> 01:26.814
It's gonna cost you another 10 grand.

01:26.814 --> 01:29.843
Or I could just make one
20-second phone call to the FBI.

01:29.843 --> 01:32.587
You wouldn't happen
to know their number, would you?

01:32.587 --> 01:33.958
You know, that's all right.

01:33.958 --> 01:36.187
I'll just call information.
It'll be a lot easier to...

01:36.187 --> 01:37.638
Hel...

01:38.509 --> 01:39.916
Hello?

01:40.515 --> 01:42.294
Son of a bitch.

03:38.856 --> 03:42.342
- Surprise. / Surprise!
- Surprise!

03:42.715 --> 03:44.852
Happy birthday, buddy.

03:44.852 --> 03:46.155
Thank you. Thank you.

03:46.155 --> 03:47.177
For...

03:47.177 --> 03:51.583
He's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow

03:51.583 --> 03:53.939
- For he's a jolly good fellow...
- This is great.

03:53.939 --> 03:56.892
This is awesome! I mean...

03:57.622 --> 03:58.893
I can't believe you remembered.

03:58.893 --> 04:00.695
Of course we remembered.
How could we forget?

04:00.695 --> 04:04.902
- My mom called you, didn't she?
- Every day for the past month.

04:04.902 --> 04:06.820
- What's that?
- It's cellophane.

04:06.820 --> 04:09.699
- Monk's idea.
- It's to protect the cake.

04:09.699 --> 04:11.953
- Makes it more fun.
- For what?

04:11.953 --> 04:15.778
Well, when you blow out the candles,
there's always a little...

04:15.778 --> 04:18.168
what I call spittle...

04:18.168 --> 04:21.918
Actually a pretty good idea.
It's a birthday cake spittle shield.

04:21.918 --> 04:23.592
You know, that's the first idea

04:23.592 --> 04:26.296
that you've had that I might actually
consider investing in.

04:26.296 --> 04:29.065
- Thank you.
- Make a wish.

04:47.028 --> 04:50.180
Blow out the candles, lieutenant.

05:12.157 --> 05:14.135
Hey, happy birthday.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.824
I think I might reconsider that investment.

05:19.270 --> 05:20.875
It's okay.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.556
It's okay. No, no, it's okay!

05:22.556 --> 05:25.630
I don't need a birthday cake...

05:25.856 --> 05:28.833
To feel the love I'm feeling
in this room right now from everybody.

05:28.833 --> 05:33.596
Hey. / It wasn't long ago I was a senior
at Temple university in Philadelphia...

05:33.596 --> 05:35.473
What?

05:35.473 --> 05:37.452
No, Roger, you can't.

05:37.452 --> 05:39.781
Because you can't.

05:40.282 --> 05:43.243
Well, I can't find anybody else.

05:43.243 --> 05:47.413
Because the dinner's tonight, Roger.
The wedding's tomorrow.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.154
So what did the doctor say?

05:52.154 --> 05:55.723
So it didn't technically burst.

05:56.165 --> 05:59.521
All right, fine, Roger,
you take care of yourself.

05:59.521 --> 06:00.834
Bye.

06:01.316 --> 06:04.097
What does an appendix do, anyway?
I mean, it's an appendix!

06:04.097 --> 06:05.561
That means it's extra, right?

06:05.561 --> 06:07.342
Is there anything I can do?

06:07.342 --> 06:09.829
That wouldn't inconvenience me?

06:09.829 --> 06:10.814
Yes.

06:10.814 --> 06:12.730
You can come with me tomorrow
to my brother's wedding.

06:12.730 --> 06:15.390
- My date just canceled.
- A wedding? No, uh...

06:15.390 --> 06:16.938
I'm sorry. Natalie, I can't.

06:16.938 --> 06:21.023
It's a bad idea for
for, for seven reasons.

06:21.023 --> 06:24.576
Wait, eight, actually,
now that I think of nine.

06:24.576 --> 06:26.753
Nine reasons.
I'm, I can't.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.335
Well, I've got the day off.
I mean, if you can't find anybody else.

06:29.335 --> 06:31.207
Hey, is Greenburg still
dating that parole officer?

06:31.207 --> 06:32.975
No. He married her.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.034
Actually, I own my own tuxedo.

06:35.034 --> 06:37.636
Ooh! What about that B&E suspect
you brought in last week?

06:37.636 --> 06:40.104
- He was kinda cute.
- Not cute enough to make bail.

06:40.104 --> 06:43.632
I'd be honored if you met my family.

06:46.984 --> 06:48.503
- It's not a date.
- I understand.

06:48.503 --> 06:51.359
I just, I, I need a buffer.
I can't handle my family alone.

06:51.359 --> 06:52.940
I'm a buffer.
I mean, I'm very buff.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.646
I mean, no pun intended.

06:54.646 --> 06:56.095
Of course, I thought
I was being funny.

06:56.095 --> 06:59.819
- Separate rooms.
- Oh, I should think so.

06:59.819 --> 07:00.875
All right, thank you.

07:00.875 --> 07:04.435
Here is the invitation.
It's in Pebble beach. / Cool.

07:04.435 --> 07:06.593
- Who's Jonathan Davenport?
- That's my brother.

07:06.593 --> 07:11.494
You're always kissably fresh
with Davenport, like the toothpaste.

07:11.809 --> 07:14.916
I'm actually not like the toothpaste.

07:14.916 --> 07:18.023
We are the toothpaste.

07:18.644 --> 07:20.257
What?

07:20.257 --> 07:21.359
Get outta here.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.779
Wait a minute. / What?

07:23.779 --> 07:25.478
This is you? / Yeah.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.862
Why didn't you ever tell us?

07:27.862 --> 07:30.740
Mr. Monk, if you spent three minutes
with them, you'd understand.

07:30.740 --> 07:34.676
I kept Mitch's name for a reason.
I don't want any part of them or that.

07:34.676 --> 07:37.811
- So I guess you're kinda loaded, huh?
- They are.

07:37.811 --> 07:41.458
They wouldn't offer me a nickel.
I wouldn't take it if they did.

07:41.458 --> 07:44.973
This doesn't change anything, does it?

07:45.313 --> 07:47.720
No. / Well, why would it?

07:47.720 --> 07:51.412
You're, you're still Natalie.
You're, you're still you.

07:51.412 --> 07:54.014
- And we're still us.
- And you're loaded.

07:54.014 --> 07:55.285
Yeah, Davenport.

07:55.285 --> 07:56.662
Karen!

07:56.662 --> 07:58.546
Yes, Mrs. Davenport?

07:58.546 --> 08:01.270
Where the hell is the photographer?

08:01.270 --> 08:03.195
He told me he would meet me here.

08:03.195 --> 08:04.125
I don't know.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.800
- But I will find him for you.
- Thank you.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.114
Hey.

08:09.518 --> 08:11.045
What are these?

08:11.045 --> 08:14.416
- Uh, they're cocktail napkins.
- Cocktail napkins are square.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.970
I, I don't know what that is.

08:16.970 --> 08:20.474
- Okay, I'm gonna fix this right away.
- Please.

08:21.523 --> 08:22.918
Karen.

08:25.688 --> 08:27.705
What is he?

08:27.705 --> 08:29.635
Uh, he's a waiter.

08:29.635 --> 08:33.128
No, I mean, is he native American?
Is he a hippie? What?

08:33.128 --> 08:35.056
Oh, I, I don't know.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.308
Well, I just don't think
he should serve tomorrow.

08:37.308 --> 08:40.111
I mean, he just doesn't quite fit.

08:40.111 --> 08:43.534
Oh, and I've change my mind
about the ratatouille. It'll drip!

08:43.534 --> 08:46.637
It'll drip all over everything.
Tell the cook!

08:47.419 --> 08:49.342
Do you believe I have to do everything?

08:49.342 --> 08:51.069
Yes, dear.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.376
Princess!

08:58.503 --> 08:59.876
Is that your dad?

08:59.876 --> 09:03.297
Robert Davenport.
Everybody calls him Bobby.

09:05.208 --> 09:08.957
- Grandpa!
- Look at you! Oh, god!

09:08.957 --> 09:11.778
You're gonna be the prettiest
flower girl in the world.

09:11.778 --> 09:13.529
Hello, sweetheart.

09:13.529 --> 09:15.393
- What does he do?
- He inherits money.

09:15.393 --> 09:17.090
- What about your mom?
- That's Peggy.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.365
She has two hobbies.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.340
Tennis, and making me feel like dirt.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.169
She's a champion at both.

09:22.169 --> 09:24.785
- They look nice.
- Oh, then you'll fit right in.

09:24.785 --> 09:27.459
Because looking nice
is what matters around here.

09:27.459 --> 09:29.288
When I was in high school,
all they cared about

09:29.288 --> 09:31.867
was whether I was dating
the right guy from the right family.

09:31.867 --> 09:33.144
And? Did you?

09:33.144 --> 09:36.824
I dated all the wrong guys.
Some of them were really wrong.

09:36.824 --> 09:37.988
Like Mitch.

09:37.988 --> 09:41.301
They still refuse to put
his picture on the piano.

09:41.301 --> 09:42.491
What, that means something?

09:42.491 --> 09:45.576
Yeah, it means something
to them, and me.

09:45.576 --> 09:47.029
God, I'm sweating.

09:47.029 --> 09:49.731
I feel like I'm allergic to them.
Is that possible?

09:49.731 --> 09:51.294
Wait, come here, come here, come here.

09:51.294 --> 09:53.840
- I need a signal.
- Signal?

09:53.840 --> 09:56.908
Yeah. If I start to panic,
I'll ask you what time it is.

09:56.908 --> 09:59.633
Okay, just get me out of there, all right?
Just drag me away.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.296
"What time is it?" I got it.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.767
Don't worry.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.912
Bye, mom.

10:09.172 --> 10:11.285
Hello, sweetheart.

10:12.389 --> 10:13.878
Hello, my dear.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.024
Oh, this is my friend.
This is Randy Disher.

10:21.024 --> 10:24.852
Mr. and Mrs. Davenport,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

10:24.852 --> 10:26.136
Both of you.

10:26.986 --> 10:29.189
I've heard great things about you.

10:29.189 --> 10:30.725
Like what?

10:30.725 --> 10:35.196
Well, uh, I mean, not about you,
specifically.

10:35.196 --> 10:36.636
About your toothpaste.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.282
Especially that new kind with
the mouthwash built right in.

10:40.282 --> 10:42.723
Bet you were the inspiration for that.

10:42.723 --> 10:45.971
Why? What's wrong with my breath?

10:48.135 --> 10:50.000
What time is it?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.289
What?

10:52.783 --> 10:55.176
What time is it? / No...

11:12.071 --> 11:14.768
There's something wrong
with this bloody Mary. Oh, honey!

11:14.768 --> 11:16.636
You're a bartender. Taste that.

11:16.636 --> 11:18.193
Mom, I'm not a bartender anymore.

11:18.193 --> 11:20.453
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
You're, you're, um,

11:20.453 --> 11:22.016
a junior detective or something.

11:22.016 --> 11:24.556
I'm an assistant to a private investigator.

11:24.556 --> 11:28.300
It's just so hard to keep straight.
I mean, what is this, job number 17?

11:28.300 --> 11:30.052
Randy, sweetheart, be a dear.
Taste this for me.

11:30.052 --> 11:32.045
What's wrong with it?

11:35.068 --> 11:36.974
- Not enough celery salt.
- Oh, that's it.

11:36.974 --> 11:38.445
That's exactly what I thought.

11:38.445 --> 11:40.693
Okay, so where's Jonathan?
I haven't even met Theresa yet.

11:40.693 --> 11:44.788
Oh, you're going to love her.
She's fantastic!

11:44.788 --> 11:47.006
Hold the presses.
You actually approve.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.261
Well, yes, we approve.

11:49.261 --> 11:52.303
We'd hardly be standing here
if we didn't approve.

11:52.303 --> 11:54.699
- So I guess you had her checked out.
- Yes, I did.

11:54.699 --> 11:56.123
This all happened very quickly.

11:56.123 --> 11:58.063
Yeah, they met about
three weeks ago in Hawaii.

11:58.063 --> 12:01.165
She's never been married.
Both of her parents are deceased.

12:01.165 --> 12:03.692
She's been living off
a very healthy trust fund.

12:03.692 --> 12:05.627
Huge. / So this girl
is not after the money.

12:05.627 --> 12:07.067
This is the real thing.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.412
Jonathan's very happy.

12:08.412 --> 12:11.602
She makes him happy.
That's all that matters.

12:11.602 --> 12:13.991
Mitch made me happy, mother.

12:13.991 --> 12:16.285
Nat. Peg.

12:16.285 --> 12:17.473
This is never gonna...

12:17.473 --> 12:19.961
This is Jonathan's day.
Can we not do this?

12:19.961 --> 12:23.286
Okay. I won't.
I'm gonna go find Julie.

12:24.842 --> 12:26.387
Well, we haven't checked in yet.

12:26.387 --> 12:28.176
Which way is the main office?

12:28.176 --> 12:31.713
Back down the steps
and across the parking lot. / Great.

12:31.713 --> 12:34.771
See you later, Peggy. Bobby.

12:36.816 --> 12:38.212
Hey, listen, I gotta get going.

12:38.212 --> 12:40.496
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:40.496 --> 12:42.710
You don't have to check in on me.

12:42.710 --> 12:43.577
Yes, I do.

12:43.577 --> 12:45.164
I promised Natalie that I would.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.742
And I swore on my mother's eyes.

12:47.742 --> 12:49.567
Captain, I'm not a baby.

12:49.567 --> 12:54.185
I'll be fine here.

12:55.102 --> 12:56.975
Alone.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.539
All day. Here.

13:00.539 --> 13:02.740
You got something to drink?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.795
It's in the fridge.

13:04.795 --> 13:09.132
There's a chart on the inside of the door.
It's color-coded.

13:09.132 --> 13:11.033
I don't need the chart, Monk.

13:12.432 --> 13:16.888
Hey, I wonder how Natalie
and Randy are doing.

13:17.124 --> 13:19.958
I love weddings.

13:19.958 --> 13:25.497
Did you know that I met
Karen at a wedding?

13:27.301 --> 13:30.579
I love weddings anyway.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.340
Yep.

13:49.852 --> 13:53.029
You know who had a great wedding?

13:53.754 --> 13:57.518
You did. You and Trudy.

13:57.518 --> 14:01.681
Now, that was a great day.

14:06.097 --> 14:09.837
Where is that photo album?

14:21.628 --> 14:23.738
She was...

14:23.738 --> 14:26.233
Wow! / Beautiful.

14:26.710 --> 14:30.204
I remember during the service
she was crying so hard,

14:30.204 --> 14:33.060
she couldn't even say the words, "I do."

14:33.060 --> 14:36.450
Have you ever seen anybody
cry so much?

14:36.450 --> 14:39.285
That was you, Monk.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.115
And, no, I have not.

15:17.203 --> 15:20.540
Randy, Randy, son, did you see
who was driving the car?

15:20.540 --> 15:22.306
Did you see?
Can you I.D. the driver?

15:22.306 --> 15:24.217
I saw that.

15:24.430 --> 15:27.437
- Silver Volvo.
- No, no, Randy, we got the car.

15:27.437 --> 15:29.066
It's right here.
Who was driving?

15:29.066 --> 15:31.084
Captain.../ Yeah?

15:31.084 --> 15:33.379
I got a license plate.

15:33.379 --> 15:35.686
I don't need the license plate, Randy.
I'm looking right at it.

15:35.686 --> 15:40.356
Four, Paul...
"C," Charles...

15:40.356 --> 15:44.151
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah, painkillers.

15:44.912 --> 15:46.613
How's he doing?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.440
Broken arm, broken leg.
Probably a couple of broken ribs.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.983
Suitcase took most of the blow.
It could have been a lot worse.

15:51.983 --> 15:54.578
- Can he identify the driver?
- He can't identify me.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.224
He'll try again later.
What do you got?

15:56.224 --> 15:57.214
Condensation.

15:57.214 --> 15:59.729
The air conditioner was running.

15:59.729 --> 16:03.066
And the humidity is, what?
About 70%.

16:03.066 --> 16:07.394
So that car was idling right here
for about 20 minutes.

16:07.394 --> 16:09.346
So, what, he was waiting for him?

16:09.346 --> 16:11.882
From the tire tracks here,

16:11.882 --> 16:15.395
he must have peeled out full speed.

16:16.632 --> 16:18.560
So, what, he didn't even try to brake.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.728
Or make the turn.

16:20.728 --> 16:22.430
Son of a bitch!

16:22.430 --> 16:23.537
What happened?

16:23.537 --> 16:27.005
He was only here for an hour.
Did he piss somebody off? / No.

16:27.005 --> 16:30.422
And we found this
on the floor of the car.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.422
Near the gas pedal.
Some kind of green mud.

16:33.422 --> 16:35.296
Well, I'll get that to the lab right away.

16:35.296 --> 16:37.409
- Captain, it's not your case.
- Like hell it's not.

16:37.409 --> 16:40.207
She's right, captain.
It's my backyard.

16:40.207 --> 16:43.397
Lieutenant Bristo.
Monterey county police.

16:43.397 --> 16:45.334
How you doing?

16:45.334 --> 16:47.514
Don't worry, you'll be
copied on every statement.

16:47.514 --> 16:48.671
Where you staying?

16:48.671 --> 16:51.308
Uh, right here, I guess.

16:51.308 --> 16:53.706
This is Adrian Monk.
He'll be staying here too.

16:53.706 --> 16:56.712
- I, I, I don't think so.
- He'll be staying here too.

16:56.712 --> 16:58.652
I guess I'll be staying here too.

16:58.652 --> 17:01.546
Well, the car's registered
to a Margaret Davenport.

17:01.546 --> 17:03.656
Margaret Davenport?

17:04.244 --> 17:05.964
Aunt Madge!

17:05.964 --> 17:07.865
Okay, aunt Madge.

17:07.865 --> 17:10.015
She said somebody took the keys
out of her coat pocket,

17:10.015 --> 17:11.726
which was in a cloak room.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.333
She was busy putting up decorations.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.523
So it wasn't her.

17:15.523 --> 17:17.046
But he knew exactly where to look.

17:17.046 --> 17:18.877
And what car was hers?

17:18.877 --> 17:21.078
There's no Volvo markings on that key.

17:21.078 --> 17:23.938
That could have been anybody.
An employee, uh...

17:23.938 --> 17:25.895
I don't think so.
I just talked to the manager.

17:25.895 --> 17:28.362
There was a staff meeting in progress.

17:28.362 --> 17:30.544
Nobody was missing.

17:33.256 --> 17:37.137
What? You're saying somebody
in my family did this?

17:37.137 --> 17:38.583
No.

17:38.963 --> 17:41.029
Why don't we get you upstairs?

17:41.029 --> 17:43.178
Hotel's comping you a room.

17:46.185 --> 17:47.406
Honey.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.686
- I'll catch up with you guys later.
- Okey-dokey.

17:50.686 --> 17:53.319
- Oh, yes, how is he?
- I hope he's gonnabe all right.

17:53.319 --> 17:56.238
Oh, now, sweetheart,
I'm sorry about your friend.

17:56.238 --> 17:58.027
But there isn't anything that you can do.

17:58.027 --> 18:01.186
So now we just have to...

18:01.186 --> 18:02.828
what?

18:04.193 --> 18:07.375
- We soldier on.
- That's right. We soldier on.

18:07.375 --> 18:10.072
Uh, now, the rehearsal dinner
is in about 20 minutes, so...

18:10.072 --> 18:11.097
What's that?

18:11.097 --> 18:13.538
Uh, oh, I found this outside.

18:13.538 --> 18:15.699
But those are Randy's pants.

18:15.699 --> 18:18.332
Oh, yes, I thought that
this color would be good to show

18:18.332 --> 18:20.163
the wedding planner for the tablecloths.

18:20.163 --> 18:23.461
- Khaki?
- No, the blood! Crimson!

18:23.461 --> 18:25.564
The ones she picked
were sort of raspberry.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.240
Didn't go with any of the flowers at all.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.046
Mom, that's an evidence bag.

18:29.046 --> 18:31.193
Yes. / You can't just take it
from a crime scene.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.266
That's a felony.

18:32.266 --> 18:34.228
Well, the tablecloths are a felony, darling.

18:34.228 --> 18:36.413
- And I'm going to give it back.
- Mom, you can't just keep it.

18:36.413 --> 18:38.343
I, no!

18:41.206 --> 18:43.696
Natalie Jane!

18:44.724 --> 18:45.726
Thank you, darling.

18:45.726 --> 18:47.907
Now, the rehearsal dinner's
going to be in about 20 minutes.

18:47.907 --> 18:50.344
So you're not gonna be
wearing that, are you?

18:57.702 --> 19:01.383
Mr. Monk! / Natalie, that gift shop
does not have my toothbrush.

19:01.383 --> 19:04.966
They do not carry the Gertler 4000.
What am I supposed to do?

19:04.966 --> 19:06.674
We're gonna worry about that later.

19:06.674 --> 19:09.310
Come on, we're late.
The rehearsal dinner's in 20 minutes.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.264
You said "we"?

19:10.264 --> 19:12.078
You said "we're late?"
I heard you say "we."

19:12.078 --> 19:14.906
- You're my date. Congratulations.
- Oh, wait!

19:14.906 --> 19:17.303
- Here's the thing.
- Mr. Monk, someone did this to Randy.

19:17.303 --> 19:19.190
Maybe somebody in my family.

19:19.190 --> 19:21.476
You're a detective, right?
This is your chance to look around.

19:21.476 --> 19:22.560
- Here's the thing.
- Here's the thing!

19:22.560 --> 19:25.068
I can't go in there alone!
You're my date!

19:28.919 --> 19:30.464
Excuse me.

19:31.969 --> 19:35.790
Oh, I don't normally stand up
and give speeches.

19:35.790 --> 19:37.807
In a minute, you're gonna find out why!

19:37.807 --> 19:39.260
And I promise, after tomorrow,

19:39.260 --> 19:42.115
I'm gonna let Jonathan
do most of the talking.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.856
Don't bet on it.

19:44.246 --> 19:50.834
Um, I just wanted to thank you, all of you,
for making me feel so at home.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.902
I know this all happened very quickly.

19:52.902 --> 19:55.596
I still don't know how you
planned all this in one week.

19:55.596 --> 20:00.411
As some of you know,
I lost my own parents in 1995,

20:00.411 --> 20:05.358
and I never thought I would
ever feel this way again.

20:05.358 --> 20:06.907
So...

20:07.695 --> 20:10.407
Mr. and Mrs. Davenport,

20:10.407 --> 20:15.700
when we met yesterday, you asked me
to call you mom and dad.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.091
At the time I didn't really
know what to say,

20:18.091 --> 20:23.270
but I've been thinking about it,
and mom and dad...

20:23.270 --> 20:26.190
I would love to.

20:28.745 --> 20:31.490
Natalie, when I was growing up
in Philadelphia,

20:31.490 --> 20:34.003
I used to dream about having a big sister.

20:34.003 --> 20:36.628
I can't wait to get to know you better.

20:36.628 --> 20:39.898
I'm having a little
bachelorette party tonight.

20:39.898 --> 20:42.296
- I really hope you can make it.
- Oh, yeah!

20:42.296 --> 20:43.861
Stop it!

20:43.861 --> 20:46.997
He keeps touching my food!

20:46.997 --> 20:48.872
No, I wasn't.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.879
I was just helping the lad.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.605
He seems kind of confused about...

20:55.605 --> 20:57.671
It's mushing all together here.

20:57.671 --> 21:00.980
He's, uh, he's fine.
He's gonna be all right.

21:04.298 --> 21:06.875
You have a nice background here.

21:08.566 --> 21:10.776
Very good. Thank you very much.

21:10.776 --> 21:12.671
Captain, what are you doing?

21:12.671 --> 21:14.387
Taking pictures.

21:14.387 --> 21:15.737
I overheard your mother say that

21:15.737 --> 21:18.226
the wedding photographer didn't
show up, so I volunteered.

21:18.226 --> 21:21.728
I borrowed this from
one of the crime tech guys. / Why?

21:21.728 --> 21:26.473
Why? Because Randy says that he thinks
he might be able to identify the driver.

21:26.473 --> 21:29.225
- Did he get a good look at him?
- Yep.

21:29.225 --> 21:32.594
Male caucasian, medium build,
red baseball cap, sunglasses.

21:32.594 --> 21:35.304
I figured I'd take some pictures,
get them developed tonight.

21:35.304 --> 21:37.289
And maybe we'll get lucky.

21:37.289 --> 21:40.557
Wait. You're undercover at
my brother's wedding? / Yeah.

21:40.557 --> 21:41.888
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

21:41.888 --> 21:46.405
It's either this, or we take
everybody upstairs, one at a time.

21:46.979 --> 21:48.801
Smile.

21:49.158 --> 21:51.055
Very nice.

21:51.055 --> 21:54.957
- Hey, sis. Mr. Monk.
- Hey, bro!

21:55.800 --> 21:57.150
That looks good on you.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.061
- Oh, the suit?
- No, the smile.

21:59.061 --> 22:00.502
He never smiles.

22:00.502 --> 22:02.687
Never had anything to smile about.

22:02.687 --> 22:04.768
You want my advice?
Get out now, save yourself.

22:04.768 --> 22:07.420
No. No, thanks.
I'm not going anywhere.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.832
Till death do us part.

22:09.832 --> 22:11.942
Hey, how's your friend?
Sergeant Disher.

22:11.942 --> 22:13.326
Oh, it's lieutenant Disher.

22:13.326 --> 22:15.878
He got pretty banged up.
But he's gonna be okay.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.534
I can't believe that
happened right outside.

22:17.534 --> 22:19.258
Yeah, we wanted to send him some flowers.

22:19.258 --> 22:21.173
- Which hospital is he in?
- No, he's back here.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.572
He's upstairs. Just resting.

22:23.572 --> 22:24.450
Oh, good!

22:24.450 --> 22:26.241
Well, we can deliver the flowers ourselves.

22:26.241 --> 22:28.634
Yeah. / Do you think he'll be able to
make it to the wedding tomorrow?

22:28.634 --> 22:30.637
Oh, gosh, probably not.

22:30.637 --> 22:32.789
- That's too bad.
- Oh, you know what?

22:32.789 --> 22:35.975
I think I'm gonna bring
my new father-in-law a drink.

22:35.975 --> 22:39.769
Oh, hey, don't forget,
in room 304, party.

22:41.448 --> 22:42.799
So...

22:42.799 --> 22:45.339
I can't believe I'm
about to say this but...

22:45.339 --> 22:49.067
Mom was right. She's great.
You don't deserve her.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.159
I don't.

22:50.159 --> 22:52.107
We have 87 things in common.

22:52.107 --> 22:53.677
Last night, we actually made a list.

22:53.677 --> 22:56.090
- Okay, stop it.
- It's crazy.

22:56.285 --> 22:59.860
And she doesn't have any family at all?
Brothers, sisters?

22:59.860 --> 23:01.264
No, she had an uncle,

23:01.264 --> 23:04.814
but he was on that Pan Am
flight to Madrid with her parents.

23:04.814 --> 23:06.797
It was a Pan Am flight?

23:06.797 --> 23:10.002
Yeah. God, she's been through so much.

23:10.002 --> 23:11.687
But it's made her stronger.

23:11.687 --> 23:14.054
And it's rubbing off.
I feel stronger too.

23:14.054 --> 23:16.799
- Soon I'll be strong like you.
- Oh, right.

23:16.799 --> 23:18.800
She's probably looking for me,
so I'm gonna go.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.157
But I'll see you tomorrow.

23:20.157 --> 23:22.152
Gulp.

23:26.224 --> 23:27.476
What?

23:27.476 --> 23:28.730
Nothing.

23:28.730 --> 23:30.619
What is it?

23:30.619 --> 23:35.299
Well, she, she said her parents
died in 1995.

23:35.299 --> 23:39.106
Pan Am went out of business in '91.

23:39.106 --> 23:41.947
So? She got a little mixed up.

23:41.947 --> 23:43.479
Yeah.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.074
Out of Service

24:25.653 --> 24:29.862
No, that M is a disaster.

24:29.862 --> 24:31.765
How about this guy?
That's, uh, that's

24:31.765 --> 24:36.549
uncle Ferdy from Memphis.

24:37.005 --> 24:38.162
No. / No?

24:38.162 --> 24:39.383
No.

24:39.851 --> 24:43.527
- That's Natalie's cousin.
- No.

24:43.527 --> 24:46.083
No pictures of Theresa?

24:46.083 --> 24:49.396
The bride. Sure. Uh...

24:51.856 --> 24:54.047
This is the back of her head.

24:54.047 --> 24:57.502
That's weird. I don't have
a good shot of her.

25:00.678 --> 25:05.431
Hey, could it have been a woman?

25:05.959 --> 25:07.829
Yeah, I guess so.

25:07.829 --> 25:10.051
- You think maybe she's the guy?
- I don't know.

25:10.051 --> 25:14.548
- She did lie about her parents.
- We'll check her out.

25:15.111 --> 25:17.602
I'll get it.

25:19.479 --> 25:21.101
All right, I'm gonna need
a bigger bottle.

25:21.101 --> 25:25.318
Uh, Randy Disher's room.
This is Stottlemeyer.

25:26.604 --> 25:28.054
What?

25:28.957 --> 25:30.078
Yeah. I understand.

25:30.078 --> 25:32.350
Uh, we'll be down there in a minute.

25:32.588 --> 25:34.308
- They found a body.
- Where?

25:34.308 --> 25:35.454
In the spa.

25:35.454 --> 25:37.367
- Who is it?
- No idea.

25:37.367 --> 25:38.903
Okay. Let's go.

25:38.903 --> 25:40.048
You're not going anywhere.

25:40.048 --> 25:43.057
Look, meet me downstairs.
Find Natalie.

25:43.860 --> 25:47.692
We had a few complaints
about you ladies.

25:47.692 --> 25:50.640
It's good thing I brought my handcuffs.

25:50.999 --> 25:55.339
Um, officer, I've been a bad girl.

25:58.862 --> 26:01.293
Hello, hello.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.747
Excuse me.

26:02.747 --> 26:04.377
Hello. Natalie.

26:04.377 --> 26:06.747
Natalie.

26:06.747 --> 26:07.792
Excuse me.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.014
Natalie.

26:11.107 --> 26:14.551
Mr. Monk. What's going on?
Is Randy okay?

26:15.248 --> 26:17.240
Anything wrong?

26:17.475 --> 26:20.351
Oh, uh, yeah. I just need
to go talk to my mom.

26:20.351 --> 26:21.930
Uh, I'll be back. Party on.

26:21.930 --> 26:23.334
Bye!

26:23.954 --> 26:26.444
Oh. Hey, you better come too.

26:26.444 --> 26:28.416
Me?

26:30.760 --> 26:32.677
There's a body downstairs.

26:32.677 --> 26:34.216
Looks like a 187.

26:34.216 --> 26:37.020
A 187? / Yeah. Lieutenant Bristo's
down there,

26:37.020 --> 26:38.928
and I think he wants you down there too.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.847
Let's go. / Okay.

26:40.847 --> 26:41.821
This way.

26:41.821 --> 26:43.544
I'm coming.

26:44.365 --> 26:46.220
What, what's that?

26:46.220 --> 26:47.692
My boom box.

26:47.692 --> 26:50.155
Boom box.

26:50.155 --> 26:53.239
Okay. Fine. Let's just go.

26:54.473 --> 26:56.705
You look like you work out a little bit.

26:56.705 --> 26:57.754
I try.

26:57.754 --> 27:00.089
I'm looking into pilates.

27:03.256 --> 27:04.899
Hey, monk.

27:04.899 --> 27:05.766
Who is he?

27:05.766 --> 27:07.292
So far, he's John Doe.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.236
We figure his wallet's
still in the mud bath.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.389
I'm willing to bet
that that mud is the same mud

27:11.389 --> 27:13.771
that you found outside in the car.

27:13.771 --> 27:15.414
- Was he the driver?
- No. Not likely.

27:15.414 --> 27:18.587
According to the coroner,
this guy died at least 36 hours ago.

27:18.587 --> 27:22.441
Captain, he's the wedding photographer.
The one that's been missing.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.222
How do you know that?

27:24.222 --> 27:27.066
The discoloration on his fingertips.

27:27.066 --> 27:29.253
It's caused by developer fluid.

27:29.253 --> 27:31.761
I've seen it on other photographers.

27:31.761 --> 27:33.435
Glad he's on our team.

27:33.435 --> 27:35.222
Well, if you're right and he's local,

27:35.222 --> 27:37.428
he'll probably have a studio in town.

27:37.428 --> 27:40.064
We'll get a search warrant.

27:43.748 --> 27:45.186
What's he doing here?

27:45.186 --> 27:48.205
Oh, that's Hondo. He's with me.

27:48.205 --> 27:51.853
Figure we might need
a little crowd control.

27:52.434 --> 27:54.606
Can I talk to you for a sec?

27:56.610 --> 27:58.230
Mr. Monk, he's not a real cop.

27:58.230 --> 28:00.563
He's a stripper.

28:01.327 --> 28:03.249
I don't think so.

28:03.249 --> 28:07.194
Didn't you see his badge?
It said, "officer feel good."

28:07.194 --> 28:08.300
So...

28:08.300 --> 28:12.756
Monk, the guy's got dollar bills
sticking out of his belt.

28:12.756 --> 28:16.026
I thought he lost his wallet.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.373
Hold on a sec.

28:20.183 --> 28:22.143
Now wait a minute.

28:25.358 --> 28:29.040
Oh, it's on my shoe.
Natalie.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.735
Ah, no, no!

28:34.350 --> 28:35.483
Wipe.

28:35.740 --> 28:37.378
Wipe!

28:38.539 --> 28:42.390
No, I need something bigger!

28:48.852 --> 28:51.112
You may be right about him.

29:11.323 --> 29:13.794
Sorry. Judge Allen was
upstate duck hunting.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.947
You got it. Search warrant.

29:15.947 --> 29:18.570
We are duly authorized.

29:24.998 --> 29:26.571
You look so pretty.

29:26.571 --> 29:29.095
Your daddy would be so proud of you.

30:14.936 --> 30:16.393
Beloved friends,

30:16.393 --> 30:20.458
we're gathered here today to celebrate
the union of Theresa and Jonathan.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.195
Two met just three weeks ago.

30:23.195 --> 30:26.533
But true love has found between.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.942
The guy's name was Frank Ruddle.

30:28.942 --> 30:31.217
I got a peek at his bank account.

30:31.217 --> 30:32.745
He was broke.

30:32.745 --> 30:34.741
Living paycheck to paycheck.

30:34.741 --> 30:36.393
Get this.

30:36.393 --> 30:39.826
According to his sister, he'd been
talking to real estate agents.

30:39.826 --> 30:41.577
Looking at houses.

30:41.577 --> 30:44.820
Thought he was gonna come into
some money.

30:47.969 --> 30:50.052
Hello.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.638
I got it. I got it.

30:53.899 --> 30:58.493
And do you, Theresa Scott,
take Jonathan Davenport
to love, honor, and cherish

30:58.493 --> 31:00.942
for better or worse,
richer or poorer,

31:00.942 --> 31:04.227
in sickness and in health
until death do you part?

31:04.227 --> 31:05.373
I do.

31:05.373 --> 31:07.804
By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

31:07.804 --> 31:11.286
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.353
You may kiss the bride.

31:17.067 --> 31:21.433
May I present you Mr. and Mrs.
Jonathan Davenport?

31:21.433 --> 31:23.404
Oh, my god.
It's her. It's Theresa.

31:23.404 --> 31:25.915
She's a black widow.

31:38.745 --> 31:40.574
It's, it's not her.

31:40.574 --> 31:43.398
Her hair is different. / Mom, she
dyed her hair blond and cut it.

31:43.398 --> 31:45.645
It's not her.

31:45.645 --> 31:49.520
This is the happiest day of his life.
Why are you doing this to your brother?

31:49.520 --> 31:52.504
I'm doing this for Jonathan.
Mom, this explains everything.

31:52.504 --> 31:54.970
Why she has no family,
why she has no friends.

31:54.970 --> 31:58.814
Because her best friend is sick
and her parents happen to be dead.

31:58.814 --> 31:59.880
Did you read this article?

31:59.880 --> 32:01.412
She killed her first husband for his money.

32:01.412 --> 32:03.379
- She might be planning to do it again.
- No, no.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.575
No, no, no. Cancel, cancel.
I don't believe it.

32:05.575 --> 32:10.534
Mrs. Davenport, Randy Disher was
the investigating officer 6 years ago.

32:10.534 --> 32:12.394
He could identify Theresa.

32:12.394 --> 32:16.967
That's why she tried to
run him down when he first got here.

32:16.967 --> 32:20.094
I'm sorry.
But that is simply preposterous.

32:20.094 --> 32:21.218
I feel something!

32:21.218 --> 32:22.807
Hey!

32:23.263 --> 32:25.083
Yesterday, she called him sergeant Disher.

32:25.083 --> 32:27.723
He was a sergeant
when she knew him 6 years ago.

32:27.723 --> 32:31.611
Excuse me, young man,
could you just go. Thank you.

32:31.957 --> 32:33.986
We both know what this is about.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.808
This is not about Theresa and

32:35.808 --> 32:37.775
some stupid photograph that
somebody found.

32:37.775 --> 32:38.858
This is about you and me.

32:38.858 --> 32:41.122
- Oh, mom, please stop.
- Yes. Yes. You and me and Mitch.

32:41.122 --> 32:43.496
And the fact that you think
that I treated him badly,

32:43.496 --> 32:46.850
Oh, this is... / And I never put
his picture on the piano

32:46.850 --> 32:49.788
as if that meant anything.

32:54.928 --> 32:56.920
I really don't see
how you can work with that man

32:56.920 --> 33:00.407
or how you can take
anything he says seriously.

33:11.983 --> 33:13.313
May I?

33:14.505 --> 33:16.202
Yes, of course.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.187
Should I be insulted?

33:26.187 --> 33:27.779
About what?

33:27.779 --> 33:29.522
The napkins.

33:29.522 --> 33:33.084
You afraid to touch me, Mr. Monk?

33:33.283 --> 33:36.173
Why would I be afraid of you?

33:36.173 --> 33:38.878
I'm not marrying you.

33:44.487 --> 33:46.244
It's a beautiful dress.

33:46.244 --> 33:48.606
Oh, thank you.

33:48.957 --> 33:51.263
And it still fits.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.519
What do you mean?

33:53.806 --> 33:58.914
You wore the same dress
in Philadelphia 6 years ago.

33:58.914 --> 34:04.996
At the time, you were using
the name Darlene Coolidge.

34:04.996 --> 34:10.161
I saw the wedding pictures,
the ones that Frank Ruddle took.

34:10.371 --> 34:11.971
Who?

34:11.971 --> 34:14.975
Frank Ruddle.

34:14.975 --> 34:21.208
The wedding photographer who made
the fatal mistake of recognizing you.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.442
Mr. Monk, I'm not...

34:23.442 --> 34:27.983
who or what you think I am.

34:27.983 --> 34:32.563
I am denying it unequivocally.

34:34.385 --> 34:38.647
However, if you were right,

34:38.647 --> 34:41.763
and I was such a woman,

34:41.763 --> 34:47.025
the last thing you'd wanna do
is get in my way.

34:47.737 --> 34:50.726
Are you threatening me?

34:56.050 --> 34:57.317
Hi.

34:57.317 --> 35:00.371
How do you plan to do it?

35:00.635 --> 35:02.271
How are you going to kill him?

35:02.271 --> 35:04.643
The song's over, Mr. Monk.

35:04.643 --> 35:06.450
Excuse me, Mrs. Davenport.

35:06.450 --> 35:08.342
They're playing our song.

35:08.342 --> 35:10.240
Oh, come here!

35:15.197 --> 35:17.698
I missed you.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.621
You broke into her room?
Is that legal?

35:50.621 --> 35:54.222
You don't need a search warrant to go into
a hotel room if it's after checkout.

35:54.222 --> 35:55.384
Is that true?

35:55.384 --> 35:58.523
- I don't know.
- What you got?

35:58.523 --> 36:01.563
Red baseball cap.

36:02.184 --> 36:03.588
Ta-da. / Green mud.

36:03.588 --> 36:04.684
- All right, let's arrest her.
- No, no, no!

36:04.684 --> 36:05.923
Natalie! Natalie!

36:05.923 --> 36:08.062
- We can't get her on this.
- But we have to do something.

36:08.062 --> 36:09.910
They're honeymooning in Mexico.
They're gonna leave any minute.

36:09.910 --> 36:13.534
If Randy can id her as Darlene Coolidge,
then we've got her.

36:13.534 --> 36:15.071
I'm gonna go see
if I can wake him up.

36:15.071 --> 36:16.213
Keep her here.

36:16.213 --> 36:18.321
Don't let her leave.

36:21.533 --> 36:23.583
It's time.

36:23.583 --> 36:25.297
Okay.

36:26.501 --> 36:28.214
Hey, we're heading out.

36:28.214 --> 36:30.972
Already? / Yeah.

36:32.615 --> 36:34.358
Theresa wants to catch an earlier flight.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.984
When she makes up her mind
about something, that's it.

36:35.984 --> 36:40.002
- The woman's a force of nature.
- Don't go.

36:40.389 --> 36:41.891
I, I need to talk to you.

36:41.891 --> 36:44.582
Oh, you don't need me to have fun.
You never did.

36:44.582 --> 36:46.836
Hi. I've got to take him.

36:46.836 --> 36:50.116
- I've got to take him, okay?
- Wish me luck.

36:50.464 --> 36:52.606
Jonathan.
Theresa.

36:54.787 --> 36:58.406
Just wanted to say a few words.

37:00.817 --> 37:03.136
I...

37:03.136 --> 37:07.609
well, the truth is I don't really know
either of you very well.

37:07.609 --> 37:12.109
But I do know a couple of things
about marriage.

37:12.109 --> 37:14.400
My wife Trudy used to say...

37:14.400 --> 37:18.446
that marriage is 90% love

37:18.446 --> 37:23.567
and 10% forgiveness.

37:23.765 --> 37:29.862
She was married to me,
so she was sort of an expert
in forgiveness.

37:30.168 --> 37:32.710
That's a true story.

37:33.182 --> 37:35.036
- Son of a bitch!
- Forget it.

37:35.036 --> 37:36.879
- Is there a latch?
- Forget it, I'm good.

37:36.879 --> 37:37.911
- You're good?
- I'm good, go!

37:37.911 --> 37:39.340
Okay. / Go, let's go.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.278
Come on!

37:44.542 --> 37:46.508
Come on, come on, come on!

37:47.003 --> 37:51.119
Anyway, I, I'd like to thank
all of you for coming.

37:51.119 --> 37:55.807
And I think I speak
on behalf of Bobby and Peggy.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.920
No, uh, no, actually, you're not.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.648
You...

38:01.400 --> 38:04.950
And, um, Jonathan and, and Theresa,
I, I, uh...

38:04.950 --> 38:08.030
I, I know you want
to take a, a minute now

38:08.030 --> 38:12.234
and just say thank you to
our wonderful waiters and waitresses.

38:12.234 --> 38:14.492
Yes, absolutely.

38:18.525 --> 38:20.072
Great, great.

38:23.746 --> 38:28.309
You know who's here, though,
is, uh, Julie Teeger.

38:28.309 --> 38:30.036
Come up here, Julie.

38:30.036 --> 38:32.162
Come on up here, please.

38:32.162 --> 38:37.531
Julie, you know, is, uh,
of course, Jonathan's niece.

38:37.531 --> 38:40.019
Come, come, come on.

38:42.200 --> 38:47.859
She has, uh, had to, uh,
memorize a poem for, for school.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.119
And she would like to recite it for you now
in honor of Jonathan and Theresa.

38:52.119 --> 38:54.247
Julie Teeger.

38:55.460 --> 38:59.031
- Come on Julie, come on girl.
- Okay, bye.

38:59.031 --> 39:02.468
Father William by Lewis Carroll.

39:02.468 --> 39:06.949
"You're old, Father William,"
the young man said.

39:06.949 --> 39:10.692
"And your hair has become very white."

39:11.933 --> 39:12.906
Sorry.

39:12.906 --> 39:17.320
"And yet you incessantly
stand on your head."

39:17.320 --> 39:22.022
"Do you think, at your age,
this is right?"

39:30.171 --> 39:33.928
"Do you think, at your age,
this is right?"

39:33.928 --> 39:37.386
- That always gets me.
- Okay, okay, okay!

39:37.654 --> 39:39.165
Shoot!

39:40.719 --> 39:42.949
When I was just a lad...

39:42.949 --> 39:46.031
We're gonna go.
Good job, good job.

39:46.031 --> 39:50.616
Well, not a lad.
You know, more of a young...

39:50.616 --> 39:52.859
fella.

39:55.430 --> 39:58.319
You know, adolescent.

39:58.319 --> 40:00.119
A teenager, really.

40:00.119 --> 40:01.895
Okay, fine.

40:02.466 --> 40:04.610
Hang on!

40:09.571 --> 40:10.854
Hey, Darlene.

40:10.854 --> 40:13.671
Long time, no see.

40:15.284 --> 40:17.182
Is this her?

40:17.182 --> 40:19.705
Darlene Coolidge.

40:20.171 --> 40:23.633
We lost track of you
back in Seattle in 2001.

40:23.633 --> 40:26.519
But by then, her name
was Phyllis Gaffney,

40:26.519 --> 40:29.927
and she was already
on husband number three.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.592
He lasted five and a half weeks.

40:32.592 --> 40:35.234
You really must've loved him.

40:35.904 --> 40:37.335
What's he talking about?

40:37.687 --> 40:39.632
Okay, okay,
don't do anything stupid.

40:39.632 --> 40:41.427
Told you we should've eloped.

40:41.427 --> 40:43.781
Hey! Dad...

40:43.781 --> 40:46.165
- You have a private jet.
- It's a company jet.

40:46.165 --> 40:50.277
I want it fueled and ready
to go in 20 minutes.

40:56.066 --> 40:58.763
Stay away from our family.

40:59.725 --> 41:02.239
We have enough problems.

41:53.530 --> 41:55.425
Thank you.
