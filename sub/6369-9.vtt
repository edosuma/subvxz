00:07.808 --> 00:09.643
Thom:
Previously on "Happyish"...

00:09.677 --> 00:10.811
Do you remember
when we first met?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.346
I came in here and I said,

00:12.380 --> 00:14.448
"Hey, Larry Nash,
love your work.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.184
I just started here."
And you know what you said?

00:16.217 --> 00:18.686
- What?
- I'm sorry to hear that.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.787
Come on,
you can't fire Larry.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.289
He's just had a baby.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.823
They're stock photos.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.093
He puts them up
so we don't fire him.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.394
That's genius.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.829
- They moved your office.
- Why?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.132
This is the new
ideation room.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.667
- Lee: An ideation room?
- Thom: An ideation room.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.169
Contemplation corner.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.837
Well, you know,
to be fair,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.472
it helps with
the "au-think-ification."

00:38.506 --> 00:39.640
Ah.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.642
These may be
our enemies abroad.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.277
These are
our enemies at home.

00:43.311 --> 00:46.280
- Parents.
- Fuckin' boomers.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.282
Thom, you feel bad
about every Army assignment.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.750
That's why we love you.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.352
Maybe I should enlist.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.821
I'll bring Julius.
Take your son to war day.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.623
I'm hoping we don't get
that desperate.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.125
( both laugh )

00:59.793 --> 01:00.828
* If you're happy
and you know it *

01:00.861 --> 01:02.663
* Clap your hands

01:02.696 --> 01:05.299
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

01:05.333 --> 01:06.767
* If you're
happy and you know it *

01:06.800 --> 01:08.336
* Then motherfucking
show it *

01:08.369 --> 01:09.837
* If you're happy
and you know it *

01:09.870 --> 01:11.439
* Clap your
motherfucking hands *

01:11.472 --> 01:12.606
* If you're happy
and you know it *

01:12.640 --> 01:14.142
* Clap your hands!

01:14.175 --> 01:18.479
( woman screaming )

01:30.158 --> 01:32.293
- ( screaming stops )
- Sorry. ( chuckles )

01:32.326 --> 01:34.862
What's up?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.231
Um...

01:40.768 --> 01:43.837
Thom, uh...

01:43.871 --> 01:47.341
Larry committed
suicide last night.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.409
What?

01:48.442 --> 01:52.880
I just--
I found out this morning.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.349
Dani sent me an article.

01:55.383 --> 01:59.853
He'd been having
trouble at home, and...

01:59.887 --> 02:01.622
uh, he...

02:01.655 --> 02:02.890
What are you talking about?

02:02.923 --> 02:05.326
He was recently
terminated

02:05.359 --> 02:08.696
at his longtime place
of employment.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.865
He had a fight
with his wife.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.368
Debbie: They'd been
having troubles.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.937
Jonathan: And he said
he was gonna kill himself.

02:16.970 --> 02:21.742
He went down in the cellar--
the... propane tanks.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.776
( voice breaking )
His wife and kids

02:22.810 --> 02:24.512
got out just--
just in time.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.913
Jonathan:
Yeah.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.648
And they don't know
if he was trying to--

02:27.681 --> 02:30.584
you know, if he was trying
to kill them too.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.486
( yelps )

02:32.520 --> 02:34.222
( gasps )

02:35.689 --> 02:38.492
Thom: The thing about suicide,
I think, is this.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.528
We get it.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.663
We totally get it.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.665
Ending it,
throwing in the towel.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.400
Fuck it.
Fuck all of it.

02:46.434 --> 02:49.737
We don't condone it.
We don't forgive it.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.406
But we totally,
totally get it.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.941
( phone dials )

02:53.974 --> 02:57.445
( line ringing )

03:01.282 --> 03:03.317
Larry: Hey, this is Larry.
Leave me a message,

03:03.351 --> 03:05.519
and I'll return it as soon
as possible. Thanks.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.820
( line beeps )

03:06.854 --> 03:09.823
Hey, Larry.
It's Thom.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.360
Uh, I just
was in the office,

03:12.393 --> 03:16.697
and I-- I heard you killed
yourself last night.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.732
So I just thought I'd call

03:18.766 --> 03:22.570
on behalf
of the office and, uh,

03:22.603 --> 03:24.938
your friends and your family

03:24.972 --> 03:28.276
and your wife
and your kids,

03:28.309 --> 03:30.511
and I thought I'd just
call you and tell you

03:30.544 --> 03:33.747
what a piece-of-shit pussy
I think you are.

03:33.781 --> 03:39.387
You're a huge, huge fucking
piece-of-shit pussy, Larry.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.454
So fuck you.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.956
Fuck you,
you fucking pussy fuck!

03:50.063 --> 03:54.034
Jonathan: This has been
a tough morning for all of us.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.004
So let's-- let's just
try and get through this

03:57.037 --> 03:58.872
as quickly as possible,
okay?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.041
Yes, let's--
let's dive right in.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.344
Well, it's very simple.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.513
The problem
for the Army is this.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.516
The country is doing well.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.652
The economy goes down,
enlistment goes up.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.354
The economy goes up,

04:13.387 --> 04:16.824
better options,
enlistment tanks.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.626
Yeah, we're having
the same problem

04:18.659 --> 04:20.461
on the frozen pizza
accounts.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.696
Nobody eats that shit
when things are good.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.931
Yeah, fuckin' recovery.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.368
Whole thing is just a plot
to weaken the military.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.070
Guess Obama really is
a secret Muslim.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.007
- Right, Thom?
- What?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.344
Gottfrid: I mean, Michelle,
surely there must be

04:36.377 --> 04:37.811
a recession
around the corner or so.

04:37.845 --> 04:38.946
Michelle:
We should be so lucky.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.914
Unfortunately,
all economic indicators

04:40.948 --> 04:43.817
point to continued growth.

04:43.851 --> 04:48.055
My suggestion...
fear.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.458
The economy
might be getting better,

04:50.491 --> 04:53.761
but the world is
as dangerous as it ever was.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.896
Don't let the numbers
fool you.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.565
We need to remind people
of this.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.533
We need to say it's not over.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.635
Not by a long shot.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.637
- Thom: The boogeyman.
- Exactly.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.805
McCarthyism.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.574
Yeah, it worked
for McCarthy.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.776
We had red scare.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.412
We had
yellow peril.

05:11.445 --> 05:15.683
Welcome to the new
"turban dread."

05:16.984 --> 05:19.019
- I like that.
- Debbie: Yeah.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.455
Fear is effective
in any economy.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.125
But doesn't it
need a color?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.728
You know, red scare,
yellow menace.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.630
What about
something with sand?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.798
Like, uh--
like the desert.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.634
Sand... band.
Sand brand?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.603
What about something
with Muhammad?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.137
Thom?

05:37.170 --> 05:41.041
Like, uh,
"Even mo' Hammad"?

05:41.074 --> 05:43.076
Tracey:
They want a color, Mikal.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.812
Ooh.
Harem scare 'em.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.079
How is that a color?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.948
What about the color
of their turbans? White?

05:47.981 --> 05:51.118
Oh, yeah. What about
"white fright"?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.387
- That's good.
- Yeah, I like "white fright."

05:53.421 --> 05:55.456
It sounds too much
like "white flight."

05:55.489 --> 05:57.525
I think "turban dread"
is more specific.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.560
What about
"tough Shiite"?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.462
"Sunni Tunes"?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.899
Announcer:
Amazing inventions.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.901
Incredible products.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.538
Welcome to
another episode of...

06:10.571 --> 06:14.775
"I'll Take Two"
with your host Jimmy Zales.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.411
( cheers and applause )

06:17.445 --> 06:20.548
( audience chanting )
I'll take two! I'll take two!

06:23.083 --> 06:28.155
( with Southern accent )
Okay.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.490
Depression.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.492
( audience groans
enthusiastically )

06:31.525 --> 06:32.626
Anxiety.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.127
( audience boos )

06:34.161 --> 06:35.596
Doubt.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.066
That creepy sensation
that life is meaningless

06:39.099 --> 06:41.602
- and destined to fail you.
- ( audience groans )

06:41.635 --> 06:44.772
You know, for centuries,
mankind has struggled

06:44.805 --> 06:46.474
to try and find solutions
to these problems.

06:46.507 --> 06:50.043
But, ladies and gentlemen,
today we have one.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.179
I give you the world's first

06:52.212 --> 06:55.182
do-it-yourself-at-home
lobotomy kit.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.084
( cheering )

07:00.153 --> 07:04.758
Now, the problem is not
disease or war or anxiety.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.994
The problem is our brain.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.796
( audience boos )

07:08.829 --> 07:11.632
Specifically,
the prefrontal cortex.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.833
( audience boos )

07:12.866 --> 07:14.735
Now, about 50 years ago,

07:14.768 --> 07:18.105
a real smart guy called
Dr. Antonio Moniz,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.774
uh, clever
little Portuguese guy.

07:20.808 --> 07:24.211
He wondered what would happen

07:24.244 --> 07:27.615
if we got rid
of that horrible cortex.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.949
Wouldn't people be happier?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.818
( audience
shouts in agreement )

07:30.851 --> 07:32.853
And the answer is yes.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.122
( cheering )

07:35.155 --> 07:37.758
Now, I know some of you guys
are thinking,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.860
"Hey, Jimmy, that sounds
a little crazy."

07:39.893 --> 07:41.695
You know how crazy that is?

07:41.729 --> 07:43.997
You know what they gave
Dr. Moniz?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.165
Audience members:
What?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.667
You know what they gave
that little guy?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.868
Audience:
What?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.803
The Nobel Prize!

07:49.837 --> 07:51.972
( cheers and applause )

07:52.005 --> 07:53.874
That's right.
For this.

07:53.907 --> 07:57.010
( audience chanting )
I'll take two! I'll take two!

07:59.880 --> 08:02.850
Gottfrid: I'll tell you
what the Army needs to do.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.218
Have you seen
that yogurt video?

08:05.252 --> 08:07.120
The one with, uh--
with the bear.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.121
Chobani.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.623
Mm,
I thought it was Dannon.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.991
The one with the bear
on the street?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.292
- That was Yoplait.
- Gottfrid: Yeah.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.127
- Chobani.
- Are you sure?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.763
- Anyways, have you seen it?
- Debbie: Yeah.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.997
No, I have not.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.799
Okay, so their whole
marketing strategy

08:18.832 --> 08:21.569
is natural ingredients.
Typical, yeah?

08:21.602 --> 08:23.236
The TV campaign, average.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.138
So they have the bear
walk into the store

08:25.172 --> 08:26.774
looking for
the natural ingredients

08:26.807 --> 08:28.108
and they give him the yogurt.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.143
Whatever. It's not winning
any One Show awards.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.146
But the digital campaign
is fantastic.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.850
They set up all these little
hidden cameras everywhere,

08:36.884 --> 08:39.019
and they put a guy
inside of a crazy,

08:39.052 --> 08:41.221
realistic
grizzly bear suit.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.157
Yeah, some sort of
a robotic sort of thing.

08:44.191 --> 08:49.697
And they let him loose on
the streets of New York, yeah?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.032
People are freaking out.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.869
Video went viral overnight.

08:55.903 --> 09:00.240
Viral.
So we're viruses now, right?

09:00.273 --> 09:02.610
That bother anybody else?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.311
They call it
prank-vertising.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.679
It's ridiculous.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.047
It's immersive
product engagement.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.782
Regardless,
the Chobani video

09:08.816 --> 09:12.986
got over 4 million
YouTube hits, okay?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.789
30,000 social shares.

09:15.823 --> 09:16.790
I mean,
did you see the LG one?

09:16.824 --> 09:18.325
That one was really cool.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.795
They do a film of a comet
hitting the city center,

09:21.829 --> 09:23.330
and the screen
is so realistic

09:23.363 --> 09:26.366
that people think, like,
doomsday is happening.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.001
You should see that,
Jonathan.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.771
It's-- it's funny,
but it's dead-on strategy.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.272
I mean,
17 million YouTube views.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.708
Last time I checked,
over a million social shares.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.810
What does this have to do
with the Army?

09:36.844 --> 09:38.812
Michelle was talking
about fear.

09:38.846 --> 09:42.049
Now, you can tell someone
to be afraid of a bear.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.284
You can tell them
how dangerous they are.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.086
And maybe they believe you
and maybe they don't.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.255
But you put a bear
in the streets,

09:48.288 --> 09:52.826
you don't have to convince
them of anything, okay?

09:52.860 --> 09:56.830
So, what
if we took a town, hmm?

09:56.864 --> 09:59.667
Middle of the country.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.935
Heartland.
Yeah?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.837
Thom, this is your account.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.238
You tell us where.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.240
And we pick a day.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.877
Yeah. Easter.
When Jesus was born.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.680
That's when Jesus
rose from the dead.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.683
Even better. Even better.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.854
And so everyone is coming out
of the churches, yeah?

10:20.888 --> 10:22.723
And they're on their way
to baseball games

10:22.756 --> 10:27.327
and barbecues
and apple pie, yeah?

10:27.360 --> 10:28.996
Then, all of a sudden,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.198
a bunch of Muslim terrorists

10:31.231 --> 10:34.702
go running right into
the church's parking lot.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.269
( screaming )

10:36.303 --> 10:37.971
Gottfrid: Two or three,
you know, pickup trucks

10:38.005 --> 10:39.773
full of militants,

10:39.807 --> 10:41.274
and they're shooting
their AKs in the air

10:41.308 --> 10:43.877
- and yelling in Arabic.
- ( yelling in Arabic )

10:43.911 --> 10:46.914
Gottfrid: Imagine it--
the look of terror

10:46.947 --> 10:48.415
on all the villagers' faces.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.150
Some of them scream
and some of them are running

10:50.183 --> 10:52.753
and some of them
just throw their hands up

10:52.786 --> 10:54.054
and they surrender
and they just--

10:54.087 --> 10:55.756
they don't
know what to do.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.257
Some of them
are calling for their kids

10:57.290 --> 10:59.793
and calling for help,
and they're screaming.

10:59.827 --> 11:04.397
Then we cut right up
to the leader.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.867
Creepy little smile.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
And then the title comes up,
and it goes,

11:09.036 --> 11:11.438
"This isn't over.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.875
Stay strong. Army strong."

11:14.908 --> 11:17.210
I mean, Thom,
you can work on the line,

11:17.244 --> 11:19.880
but the video'll go viral
overnight.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.314
Guaranteed it blows up
the Internet.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.085
And we'll double
the enlistment numbers

11:25.118 --> 11:27.788
of any month
in the past three years.

11:27.821 --> 11:33.293
That is wrong on every
moral and ethical level

11:33.326 --> 11:34.394
I can think of.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.429
Thank you.

11:36.463 --> 11:40.801
But Christ Almighty,
it would work like gangbusters.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.770
( snorts )
Hell, I'd enlist.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.037
( all chuckle )

11:44.071 --> 11:45.873
Thom, you know
the general better than--

11:45.906 --> 11:47.274
( glass breaks )

11:47.307 --> 11:49.076
Jonathan:
God damn it.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.244
Jesus.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.382
( sighs )

11:55.415 --> 11:57.785
When is the Army meeting?

11:57.818 --> 12:00.287
An hour.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.355
Fuck you, Larry.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.897
You're not
quitting your job, Thom.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.399
I am. I have to.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.135
Fine, honey, maybe you will,

12:48.168 --> 12:50.137
but now is not the time
to consider it

12:50.170 --> 12:52.806
when Larry just
fucking killed himself.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.907
Maybe it is, Lee.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.176
Maybe this
is the best time.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.578
No, it's not.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.914
Do you know what I thought
the second that you told me?

13:00.948 --> 13:04.918
I thought, "I'm taking
Julius to Hebrew school."

13:04.952 --> 13:06.219
Lee, come on.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.555
Death fucks
with our heads, Thom.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.057
I mean, I thought,

13:10.090 --> 13:12.159
"Maybe he should learn
about his past.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.162
Maybe he should know
about his traditions.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.998
Maybe I should give him
something of meaning,

13:18.031 --> 13:22.569
something spiritual,
something fuckin' holy,

13:22.602 --> 13:23.971
for fuck's sake.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.406
Or maybe, I don't know,
quit my job."

13:26.439 --> 13:29.176
You know what Larry
told me

13:29.209 --> 13:32.245
when we first met
20 years ago?

13:32.279 --> 13:34.314
He said, "If I'm still
in advertising when I'm 40,

13:34.347 --> 13:35.582
do me a favor.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.318
Come find me and blow
my fucking brains out."

13:38.351 --> 13:40.387
Hey, you can't sit here.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.554
Why not?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.491
Can't sit here.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.293
I guess he just decided,
you know,

13:46.326 --> 13:47.460
not to wait for me.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.062
Thom,
Larry did not kill himself

13:49.096 --> 13:50.964
because he was
in advertising.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.033
If anything, he killed himself
because he wasn't.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.869
I can't spend my whole life
like this, Lee. I can't.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.204
Let's go, pal.
Move it.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.539
Welcome one another
as Christ welcomed you.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.475
- That's Romans 15.
- Thom, who you talking to?

14:02.509 --> 14:05.178
This guard's trying to throw me
off the goddamn church steps.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.215
Okay, just go, Thom.
Don't make it any worse.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.617
I have to write, Lee.
I have to make a change.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.885
I'm not gonna ask you again.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.453
All right. Okay.
Can I stand?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.022
- Is it okay if I just stand?
- You can stand where you like.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.024
Thank you.
God, that new Pope's

14:17.057 --> 14:18.591
really loosening
things up, isn't he?

14:18.625 --> 14:21.161
Lee:
Thom. Thom?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.329
Yes.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.997
Thom, just come home.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.066
I can't.
I'm seeing Dani.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.336
Thom,
this is Larry's tragedy.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.971
It's not yours.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.940
Don't make it your tragedy.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.977
Jonathan:
Did you try his cell phone?

14:37.010 --> 14:37.810
Twice.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.512
- Did you text him?
- Three times.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.214
Fuck.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.251
Go down and wait for him
in the lobby.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.385
Got it.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.454
When he gets here, tell him
to get his melodramatic ass

14:47.487 --> 14:49.122
into the motherfucking
Army meeting.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.193
General.
How are you, sir?

14:53.226 --> 14:54.561
- Good, good. How are you?
- Good to see you.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.129
Dani:
You're not quitting, Thom.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.464
I am. I am.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.199
I can't do this anymore.

14:59.232 --> 15:03.270
I have to. You've gotta
find me something else.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.405
"Here lies Thom Payne.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.407
Wrote some
Army commercials."

15:07.440 --> 15:09.542
"Provided for
his wife and son."

15:09.576 --> 15:11.711
"Wrote taglines
instead of novels."

15:11.744 --> 15:14.281
"Put his family's needs
before his own."

15:14.314 --> 15:18.218
"Lived, ate shit, died."

15:18.251 --> 15:19.152
What does Lee think?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.954
Why do you always wanna know
what Lee thinks?

15:20.988 --> 15:23.090
Because she's smarter
than you are.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.496
Thom, Larry did not
kill himself

15:29.529 --> 15:31.298
because he worked
in advertising.

15:31.331 --> 15:36.103
He killed himself
because he is a fucking coward.

15:36.136 --> 15:40.107
And probably because he
no longer worked in advertising.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.710
I keep thinking about God.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.178
Is he hiring?

15:45.212 --> 15:49.983
Oh, not me.
I'm a fallen Catholic.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.718
You know,
God hates suicide.

15:51.751 --> 15:55.188
Do you know why?
Because he's a control freak.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.725
Because he gets to decide
who dies and when.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.460
That's part of the fun
of being God.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.129
He creates these creatures

16:02.162 --> 16:04.097
and-- and gets
to push 'em around,

16:04.131 --> 16:05.732
but then one day
the creatures realize,

16:05.765 --> 16:07.434
"Hey, we can
kill ourselves.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.337
We can check out of this
shitty hotel any time we like,"

16:10.370 --> 16:12.105
and that drives God crazy.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.342
He's a classic
type-A personality.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.643
That's what I'm saying.

16:16.676 --> 16:21.214
See, I find believing
in God comforting.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.383
Believing in God?
You don't believe in anything.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.219
Well, not a good God.
A bad God.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.289
Do you remember
the watchmaker's analogy?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.757
Remind me.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.759
It's that
teleological bullshit

16:32.792 --> 16:34.561
they used
to teach us in school

16:34.594 --> 16:36.696
where you're walking
through a desert

16:36.729 --> 16:38.165
and you see
a watch in the sand,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.100
and it has all
these intricate gears

16:40.133 --> 16:41.701
and shifts and
beautiful engraving...

16:41.734 --> 16:44.604
And anything that, uh,
beautiful and perfect

16:44.637 --> 16:46.106
must have been built
by somebody.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.707
Yes. And this makes
you feel better?

16:47.740 --> 16:48.708
Do you want another round?

16:48.741 --> 16:52.579
Uh, yeah. Fuck it.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.615
I believe in
the Swatch-maker analogy.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.651
Something this shitty
and cheap and ugly

16:58.685 --> 17:01.054
could not possibly
be an accident.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.489
Shit this bad
doesn't just happen.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.091
Nope. Not at all.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.826
Somebody had to unintelligently
design this pile of crap.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.362
( laughs )

17:11.198 --> 17:14.234
Woman: Okay, kids.
Who's ready to sing?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.535
Here we go.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.337
All:
* We obey His rules

17:17.370 --> 17:19.239
* He's a powerful God

17:19.272 --> 17:22.142
* When God says jump,
we say how high... *

17:22.175 --> 17:24.144
Very good!

17:24.177 --> 17:26.713
- I wanna go.
- All right, soon, buddy.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.149
Why are they wearing
those hats?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.251
Oh, those are called
yarmulkes.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.086
That's what Jews wear.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.521
Am I a Jew?

17:34.554 --> 17:37.090
Yeah, you are.
So am I.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.558
Is Dad a Jew?

17:38.591 --> 17:41.294
Uh, no.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.662
He's lucky.

17:42.695 --> 17:46.199
* Don't watch TV
or smoke cigars... *

17:46.233 --> 17:49.269
- I wanna go.
- Okay, soon. Soon.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.238
* Shabbos is the day
we pray... *

17:51.271 --> 17:52.839
What's Shabbos?

17:52.872 --> 17:55.508
Oh, that--
that means "Saturday."

17:55.542 --> 17:57.577
They sure like Saturday.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.647
Well, yeah. Who doesn't?
Saturdays are awesome.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.383
Great job. Give yourselves
a round of applause.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.552
Did you have a good time?

18:05.585 --> 18:06.786
Children:
Yes.

18:06.819 --> 18:10.223
And who do we thank
when we had a good time?

18:10.257 --> 18:11.724
- Children: God.
- Why?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.460
'Cause he's the ruler
of the universe?

18:13.493 --> 18:14.661
Well, that's debatable.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.729
And why did he give us
a good time?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.532
Because we obeyed
his commandments?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.201
- That's exactly right.
- That's not true.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.569
Woman: All right, I think
it's time for a little

18:22.602 --> 18:25.205
"Hashem is Here," okay?

18:25.238 --> 18:28.741
* Hashem is here,
Hashem is there... *

18:28.775 --> 18:31.911
- Who's Hashem?
- That's Hebrew for "God."

18:31.944 --> 18:33.646
What's God?

18:33.680 --> 18:37.217
Ugh...
I'll explain it later.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.718
He sounds strict.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.354
Well, you know,
He runs a tight ship.

18:41.388 --> 18:45.425
How can Hashem
be everywhere?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.495
I don't know.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.598
Is he here now?

18:51.631 --> 18:54.301
Uh, I guess so.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.369
Is he there when I sleep?

18:56.403 --> 18:59.772
( sighs ) You know, why don't
we talk about it in the car?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.508
Let's go.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.410
Is he there when I poop?

19:03.443 --> 19:07.647
Okay, shh.
Go, go, go, go, go.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.550
* Hashem is here,
Hashem is there *

19:10.583 --> 19:14.387
* Hashem is truly
everywhere... *

19:14.421 --> 19:16.289
Can I take a cookie?

19:16.323 --> 19:18.391
- Mm.
- Please.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.959
Okay, but just one.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.328
This is how
they get you, you know.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.595
It's a gateway cookie.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.797
Pretty soon you're gonna
be asking for a tallis.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.234
- What's a tallis?
- Oh, it's like a cape.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.835
Well, I want a cape.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.903
Well, you're not
getting a cape. Go.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.941
( phone ringing )

19:34.974 --> 19:37.644
General:
Is this some kind of joke?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.779
We know it's out of the box
for you guys,

19:39.812 --> 19:41.648
but immersive product
engagement

19:41.681 --> 19:44.684
can really move the needle.
Worked wonders for Chobani.

19:44.717 --> 19:45.918
Where's Thom?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.554
Uh, Thom actually
got called away.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.821
Did he approve this?

19:48.855 --> 19:50.823
General,
your numbers are down.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.659
And they're going
to continue to go down

19:52.692 --> 19:53.993
unless you do something
memorable--

19:54.026 --> 19:55.562
General: Son,
are you really proposing

19:55.595 --> 19:56.896
that we send
a team of actors

19:56.929 --> 19:58.565
into an American
small town

19:58.598 --> 19:59.966
and pretend
it's a terrorist takeover?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.334
Yes.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.903
This is just
one idea, obviously.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.305
You folks are aware,
are you not,

20:05.338 --> 20:06.706
that America
has the highest

20:06.739 --> 20:09.709
gun per capita ratio
of any nation in the world?

20:09.742 --> 20:12.312
There's 300 million
guns out there.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.913
The second closest
is Serbia.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.449
We are aware of that,
General.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.017
We think
that gun-ownership number

20:18.050 --> 20:21.521
reflects a unique
paranoia opportunity

20:21.554 --> 20:24.457
that a staged
terrorist takeover

20:24.491 --> 20:26.426
can play really well into.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.330
The Army is not yogurt.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.964
We don't engage in pranks.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.900
And while we can debate
whether or not

20:33.933 --> 20:36.603
gun ownership
indicates paranoia,

20:36.636 --> 20:38.705
there's no doubt that
what it does indicate

20:38.738 --> 20:41.674
is the very heavy
presence of guns.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.610
I don't know what it's like
where you're from, son,

20:43.643 --> 20:45.478
but you take
a handful of actors,

20:45.512 --> 20:46.813
dress them up like
Islamic terrorists,

20:46.846 --> 20:49.048
and drive them into the middle
of small-town America,

20:49.081 --> 20:52.051
I can assure you of one
thing and one thing only.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.021
There will be so many
bullet holes in those actors,

20:55.054 --> 20:57.390
their own mothers
won't recognize them.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.434
Fuck you, Larry.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.868
Thom: I'll call them.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.371
Yeah, you're goddamn right
you're gonna call 'em.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.005
I was with Dani.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.341
Oh, fuck you, Thom.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.775
I don't care if
you were with God.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.044
If you wanna quit, quit.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.646
Don't take me down with you.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.914
I am killing myself
keeping the Swedes off you.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.650
I am protecting you
at every turn.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.818
The Army is your biggest
goddamn account.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.288
You're gonna fuck around?
Come on.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.660
I can't
do this anymore, Jon.

21:33.693 --> 21:37.664
I can't. It's--
it's always been sick,

21:37.697 --> 21:42.068
but lately
it's just gotten viral.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.637
It's a job, Thom.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.039
It's supposed to suck.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.545
The cavemen
didn't like hunting,

21:52.579 --> 21:54.714
but they did it
to stay alive.

21:54.747 --> 21:58.551
The lion doesn't like
chasing the gazelle,

21:58.585 --> 22:01.421
but he does it every day.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.789
And I'll tell you
something else.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.491
The day
the lion asks himself

22:04.524 --> 22:07.460
if he's right
to kill the gazelle

22:07.494 --> 22:09.429
is the day the lion dies.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.998
Make it right
with the general today.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.108
I was sorry to hear
about Larry, Thom.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.710
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.646
We had a saying during
Operation Iraq Freedom, right?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.915
Embrace the suck.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.417
( both chuckle )

22:30.450 --> 22:31.984
Yeah, you'd see it
written sometimes,

22:32.018 --> 22:35.388
"ETS," on walls, on boots.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.390
You gotta just
embrace the suck.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.491
It's true for life too.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.693
Yeah, uh, look, General,

22:40.727 --> 22:42.995
I'm sorry I bailed
on the meeting.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.531
I just wasn't in the mood

22:44.564 --> 22:46.599
to talk about death
and destruction today.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.835
Yeah, no shit.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.571
I remember when I first
joined the military.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.906
All us young soldiers
prided ourselves, right,

22:53.940 --> 22:56.876
on our willingness to die
for each other, for our country.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.546
We thought it was the bravest
thing you could do.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.648
And then you get older.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.082
And you fall in love
and you get married

23:03.115 --> 23:04.651
and you have some kids.

23:04.684 --> 23:09.489
And you realize it's a far
braver thing to stay alive.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.024
It's not
what you'll die for.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.993
It's what in this
sometimes shitty world

23:14.026 --> 23:15.662
you'll stay alive for.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.732
Yeah.

23:19.766 --> 23:23.503
Gotta say, it's, uh, strange
accepting that level of wisdom

23:23.536 --> 23:25.972
from someone with 35
confirmed kills.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.173
37.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.975
Oh, sorry.
My mistake.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.143
( both chuckle )

23:32.612 --> 23:33.813
Thom as Jimmy Zales:
Depression.

23:33.846 --> 23:34.947
( audience boos
enthusiastically )

23:34.981 --> 23:37.650
- Anguish.
- ( audience boos )

23:37.684 --> 23:40.520
- Self-awareness.
- ( audience boos )

23:40.553 --> 23:41.754
I hate that.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.490
Don't know what to do
with your hands.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.925
( laughter )

23:45.958 --> 23:49.028
Incidents of depression
after lobotomy--

23:49.061 --> 23:50.196
zero.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.599
( cheers and applause )

23:52.632 --> 23:56.002
Incidents of drug abuse
after lobotomy--

23:56.035 --> 23:57.136
zero.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.671
( cheers and applause )

23:58.705 --> 24:02.975
Incidents of suicide
after lobotomy--

24:03.009 --> 24:04.577
Audience:
Zero!

24:04.611 --> 24:07.580
You know. You know.
That's why-- all right.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.115
That's right.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.485
Buy one, get a second one

24:12.519 --> 24:16.756
for a parent or a loved one
half price.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.258
That's why we say...

24:19.291 --> 24:22.228
"I'll take two!"

24:22.261 --> 24:24.230
Lee:
What about love, Thom?

24:24.263 --> 24:25.965
You'll take--
what?

24:25.998 --> 24:27.967
After a lobotomy.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.101
You'll never feel sadness,

24:29.135 --> 24:31.604
but you'll also
never feel love.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.706
Never feel joy.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.075
( in normal voice ) Yes, but
you don't feel pain either.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.711
Is that worth it, Thom?

24:42.615 --> 24:45.518
Is it worth it
to never feel pain again

24:45.552 --> 24:48.955
if you'll also
never feel love?

24:51.891 --> 24:52.925
I don't know.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.193
I don't know.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.128
You don't know?

25:00.833 --> 25:04.704
There's a-- there's a--
a free carrying case.

25:04.737 --> 25:08.074
You have to order it today.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.777
( sighs )

25:15.815 --> 25:19.251
Thom: When I was a teenager,
my grandmother died.

25:19.285 --> 25:23.022
She and my grandfather
had been married for 60 years,

25:23.055 --> 25:27.259
and as soon as she died,
he began to get sick.

25:27.293 --> 25:30.630
The doctor said
he had given up,

25:30.663 --> 25:32.832
that his body
didn't want to live.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.167
"Go and talk to him,"
said my mother.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.036
"Tell him.
Tell him to live."

25:37.069 --> 25:39.806
So I went to him and I said,
"Grandpa, you should live."

25:39.839 --> 25:43.242
And he said, "Why?"
He said, "I've had a good life.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.779
But without my Phyllis,
I just don't want to be here."

25:46.813 --> 25:50.883
I decided that was all
I ever wanted out of life,

25:50.917 --> 25:53.853
to meet someone
I didn't want to live without.

26:00.927 --> 26:01.761
Mm.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.630
Um, just so you know,

26:03.663 --> 26:05.331
when we get really old,

26:05.364 --> 26:09.235
like crazy, shrunken old,

26:09.268 --> 26:11.671
and we're in diapers,

26:11.704 --> 26:13.773
if you die before me,

26:13.806 --> 26:15.642
I'm totally
gonna kill myself.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.744
Oh, no doubt.
Me too.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.979
Yeah.
I mean that night.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.380
Check, please.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.716
Yeah. Good.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.719
How are you
gonna do it?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.354
Mm, I don't know.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.289
Bag of shrooms.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.824
Wait for 'em to kick in,

26:31.858 --> 26:33.325
and then just walk
into the ocean.

26:33.359 --> 26:37.229
I want something quick,
though, you know?

26:37.263 --> 26:38.698
Handgun?

26:38.731 --> 26:40.900
- That's too clichéd.
- Mm.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.368
Someone's gotta
clean up the mess.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.203
No, um...

26:44.236 --> 26:45.838
Head in the oven?

26:45.872 --> 26:47.206
Too German.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.709
Plastic bag
on your head?

26:49.742 --> 26:52.979
Yeah, but then, you know,
what kind of bag?

26:53.012 --> 26:54.947
You don't wanna be staring
at a Target logo

26:54.981 --> 26:57.416
as you shuffle off
your mortal coil.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.251
Barnes & Noble bag?

26:59.285 --> 27:01.353
Yeah,
but, you know, that's--

27:01.387 --> 27:03.255
even then,
you're staring at that

27:03.289 --> 27:05.892
fucking
James Joyce woodcut.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.260
Maybe you could get
Virginia Woolf.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.729
Mm.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.298
Maybe I could just
fuck myself to death.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.833
You know, get a room

27:13.866 --> 27:19.171
full of hookers and booze
and blow and...

27:19.205 --> 27:20.740
cookies.

27:20.773 --> 27:26.145
And just fuck and fuck
until my heart gives way

27:26.178 --> 27:29.749
and I just drop dead.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.418
I mean,
you only die once, right?

27:38.357 --> 27:40.760
( line ringing )

27:40.793 --> 27:42.829
Larry: Hey, this is Larry.
Leave me a message,

27:42.862 --> 27:44.764
and I'll return it as soon
as possible. Thanks.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.367
- ( line beeps )
- Thom: Hey, Larry, it's Thom.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.738
Listen, if you didn't
get my last message,

27:51.771 --> 27:54.440
just, you know, delete it.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.977
Okay. Bye, Larry.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.747
( dial tone )
