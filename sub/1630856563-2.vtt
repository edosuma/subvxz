00:32.742 --> 00:38.247
Okay. So the extermination
is coming in six months instead of a year.

00:38.247 --> 00:41.375
No big deal.
Just a little setback.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.085
Nothing we can't handle.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.795
Just angels cutting
our timetable in half.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.630
But who needs a whole year
to save souls?

00:46.630 --> 00:48.424
Am I right?
And next time,

00:48.424 --> 00:50.176
when they cut the
time in half again and again,

00:50.176 --> 00:51.552
we'll just handle it, right?!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.721
Yes, we will.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.433
Oh, please, ya had less
than half a chance when you started

00:57.433 --> 01:00.102
all this salvation bullshit.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.439
And now... Ain't no silver
lining this time toots.

01:03.439 --> 01:07.735
Sure there is. We just have to
look a little harder for it.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.655
Well, while you're lookin,
the rest of Hell is going nuts.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.492
People are already freaking out
about the news.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.453
Look at what's happening in the
Doomsday District.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.622
Err, what is
a "donkey show"?

01:19.622 --> 01:24.668
Aah, heh, nothing. My boss, Val,
is just freaked out about the news, too.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.629
Like I said,
everyone's losing their shit.

01:26.629 --> 01:30.883
Yeah, that's true.
Sinners are desperate.

01:30.883 --> 01:35.638
Maybe desperate enough to try
anything to escape the extermination?

01:35.638 --> 01:41.894
This is the perfect time
to recruit more sinners for the hotel!

01:41.894 --> 01:45.439
Cute idea and all,
but you really going to go out in all of this?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.359
Well, it's not like people are
just going to show up on our doorstep.

01:50.236 --> 01:53.280
Show yourself, Alastor!

01:53.280 --> 01:56.283
Come and face--

01:56.283 --> 01:57.576
Oh, there you are...

01:57.576 --> 01:59.912
Face my wrath!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.247
Who are you?

02:01.247 --> 02:04.500
Who am I?
Who am I?

02:04.500 --> 02:11.507
I am the great Sir Pentious! Inventor,
architect of destruction,

02:11.507 --> 02:14.301
villain extraordinaire!

02:14.301 --> 02:16.804
Woo! You tell 'em, boss.

02:16.804 --> 02:20.349
Ooh, he's a bad boy.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.685
Huh, well if all that's true,
you'd think I'd have heard of you.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.354
I attacked
you literally last week.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.732
We've done battle, like... 20
times.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.610
Well, you must have been
really bad at this.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.946
Silence! Now cower!

02:33.946 --> 02:38.284
For when I've
slain you, the almighty Vees

02:38.284 --> 02:41.537
will finally acknowledge me
as their equal!

02:41.537 --> 02:44.373
Ooh! Wait, who are the Vees?

02:44.373 --> 02:46.458
Oh, nobody important.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.880

03:19.909 --> 03:22.244
<i>Oh, cut the shit, Vox.

with Val.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.682
Hey, hey, hey.
Fuck my life.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.688
Mr Vox! Mr Vox!

03:49.688 --> 03:53.442
Mr. Vox, question
for you over here. Mr Vox

03:53.442 --> 03:56.445
Mr. Vox. What are your thoughts
on the new extermination deadline?

03:56.445 --> 04:01.283
My dear people, we at VoxTek
Enterprises have always been

04:01.283 --> 04:03.869
at the forefront of innovation.

04:03.869 --> 04:09.458
And now with this new
oncoming threat, we are shifting our focus

04:09.458 --> 04:12.336
to your protection.

04:12.336 --> 04:17.466
We are pleased to announce
VoxTek Angelic Security is coming soon.

04:17.466 --> 04:22.596
Trust us with your safety.

04:22.596 --> 04:27.518
Sir? Uh, when did we begin
working on Angelic Security?

04:27.518 --> 04:30.771
30 seconds ago. Try to
get that bitch Carmilla on the books

04:30.771 --> 04:32.648
and cancel all my
appointments today.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.692
I have a fire
to put out upstairs.

04:39.571 --> 04:43.325
Ugh. No.
Unacceptable. You're fired.

04:43.325 --> 04:47.871
What is this? Wrist ruffles?
Is it 1750?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.915
Burn it like the witches
who wore it.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.334
Oh, Velvet.
I can see you're busy.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.545
Tell me where's our hot
headed friend now?

04:54.545 --> 04:59.049
Up in his tower, waiting for
a flat-faced prince to calm him down.

04:59.049 --> 05:04.346
And uh, what's got him
so out of sorts today?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.516
Who knows?
But he tore up my best model.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.352
And you know, the show can't
wait for that unlucky bitch

05:10.352 --> 05:12.021
to pull herself back together.

05:12.021 --> 05:14.356
Melissa, get over here.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.983
No. No. Hideous.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.360
I want to die. Eww.
Oh, yes. That's the one.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.112
Well, looks like you have
everything under control here.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.573
Of course I do.
Fuck you. Now shoo!

05:22.573 --> 05:24.825
Take care of the piss baby.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.794
Fuckin' finally,

05:35.794 --> 05:38.464
Kitty, another drink.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.632
Can you believe what
that piece of shit did?

05:40.632 --> 05:43.552
The ungrateful whore!

05:43.552 --> 05:45.387
Um which whore are
we talking about this time?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.056
Fucking Angel Dust.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.475
Who the hell else
would I be talking about?

05:49.850 --> 05:53.437
That fucking slut
walked out on me. Me.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.897
I fucking made him.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.732
Without me, he's just a bag of
meat

05:56.732 --> 05:58.650
with some mildly
entertaining holes.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.612
- Angel quit?
- No, he didn't fucking quit.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.615
It's worse. He moved!

06:04.615 --> 06:08.535
He thinks he can just walk in here,
work, and then go home somewhere else.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.120
Can you fucking believe that?!

06:10.120 --> 06:11.872
He thinks he can run off

06:11.872 --> 06:13.916
and shack up with Lucifer's
bimbo daughter?

06:13.916 --> 06:16.752
Angel is living with
Lucifer's daughter now?

06:16.752 --> 06:19.463
Yeah, that bitch. Chalkie,
or Chandler, or...

06:19.463 --> 06:20.589
I don't know.
Something mannish like that.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.091
She's got this hotel and--

06:22.091 --> 06:24.134
And which of these makes me
look sexier?

06:24.134 --> 06:26.095
What are you doing, Val?

06:26.095 --> 06:28.097
You're not going over there.

06:28.097 --> 06:31.600
That slippery twink is
going to remember who owns him.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.937
I'm going to fuck everyone in
that rancid shithole, I swear to God.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.981
Val!
Think about it.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.484
Our brand is perfection.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.694
And what do you think
chasing whores around town

06:42.694 --> 06:44.196
will do for our image?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.657
Uh... Fuck it up?

06:46.657 --> 06:48.700
Right!

06:48.700 --> 06:51.787
Do you want people thinking you
can't control your employees?

06:51.787 --> 06:53.622
- No.
- Exactly.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.667
And, hey, you still have him
under contract.

06:56.667 --> 07:00.546
He isn't going anywhere.
So you should...?

07:00.963 --> 07:02.923
Do nothing?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.760
Great idea. Now, that's
why they pay you the big bucks.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.888
But I really wanted
to shoot someone.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.724
Well, let me call up the lowest
earners this month.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.937
Oh, you know me too well.

07:19.565 --> 07:24.069
You know, Angel isn't the only
one spending time at this ratty hotel

07:24.069 --> 07:26.155
with the devil's <i>princessa</i> .

07:26.155 --> 07:28.949
Oh, who else is there?
Someone who owes you money?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.661
Someone who owes
us much more than money.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.204
The Radio Demon is there.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.750
What did you just say?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.544
You heard me.

07:40.544 --> 07:45.048
Alastor came back and he is with
Lucifer's daughter,

07:45.048 --> 07:49.052
and that wasn't
the first fucking thing you told me?!

07:49.052 --> 07:52.014
Hey, killing Alastor
is your kink.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.019
Arrgh,
Oh! Please! Stop!

07:57.019 --> 07:59.104
Um, Alastor?
I think he's had enough.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.149
Nah, he's got a few more
hits in im!

08:02.149 --> 08:04.026
Aahhh!

08:04.026 --> 08:07.863
Thanks for
another forgettable experience.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.159
Thank... you...
for letting your guard down!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.494
Haha! Yah! Oh, shit.

08:14.953 --> 08:20.000
Argh!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.794
Well, it looks as though
I need a visit to the tailor.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.713
Best of luck, chums.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.632
Wait. You're leaving?

08:26.632 --> 08:29.551
Alastor, we need your help.
We need you to do your job.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.302
We need a wall.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.221
Of course.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.890
Can't let my new project fall
into disrepair already.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.141
What would the papers say?

08:39.853 --> 08:42.564
Hey, sweet cheeks.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.982
What you doing later?

08:43.982 --> 08:47.861
I love me a man with a giant...
tool.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.072
See? Look,
at how he flirts with that guy,

08:50.072 --> 08:52.074
and he's not even paying.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.244
Who is that? I'm gonna fucking
kill his whole fucking family.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.828
Vox? Vox?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.251
That fucker is back!

09:02.251 --> 09:04.670
Yeah, I thought he was gone
for good too.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.255
It's been seven years!

09:06.255 --> 09:09.007
You still pissed
he almost beat you that time?

09:09.007 --> 09:11.760
- Uh, fuck you.
- Just saying.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.887
Things have changed a lot
since he left town.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.180
That's for sure.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.765
I got to send a message

09:16.765 --> 09:19.017

12:00.345 --> 12:03.890
Alastor is getting close
to Little Princess Morning Star.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.436
So our main concern now is
ensuring that no deal is ever struck

12:07.436 --> 12:10.981
between Lucifer's brat
and that smiling freak.

12:10.981 --> 12:14.109
Well, how exactly
are we supposed to stop it?

12:14.109 --> 12:15.861
Put something inside them.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.946
That's how I get the bitches
to behave.

12:17.946 --> 12:22.909
Well maybe someone on the inside
isn't such a bad idea.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.369
Do you think Angel would?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.164
That lanky prick
won't even return my calls.

12:27.164 --> 12:32.252
We need someone who Little Miss
Bleeding Heart would take in.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.882
Someone pathetic, desperate,
with no direct ties to us.

12:36.882 --> 12:40.385
I employ every down on their
luck loser this side of hell.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.970
Who the fuck is left?

12:43.889 --> 12:47.476
I think I have just the one.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.937
Hmmph!

12:50.937 --> 12:53.356
So how'd it go?

12:53.356 --> 12:56.234
Not a single new recruit.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.029
Yeah. Well, who would want
to use their last days

12:59.029 --> 13:01.406
not fucking and fighting?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.536
Why, hello, my dear--

13:08.163 --> 13:09.331
Wait wait wait!

13:09.331 --> 13:12.083
I come in peace.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.460
What are you doing here?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.003
Vaggie what's the problem?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.838
Oh, hello again.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.341
I didn't come
looking for a fight. I uhh...

13:19.341 --> 13:22.177
I heard that you're
helping people.

13:22.177 --> 13:25.013
People who want to be better?

13:25.013 --> 13:27.015
You heard right.

13:27.015 --> 13:31.895
Welcome to our home of healing.
Our resort of restoration. Our--

13:31.895 --> 13:33.313
Are you fucking nuts?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.148
This chump was trying to kill
us, like,

13:35.148 --> 13:37.067
literally 6 hours ago.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.529
And now you want to bring him
in here to live with us?

13:40.529 --> 13:42.113
Absolutely!

13:42.113 --> 13:43.907
This place is about
second chances.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.076
And who deserves one more than
this...

13:46.076 --> 13:51.873
slithery... slippery...
special little man.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.333
Aren't you're supposed
to protect this place?

13:55.627 --> 14:00.173
I... guess he's not much of a
threat without the war machine

14:00.173 --> 14:02.509
or even with the war
machine.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.886
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you!

14:04.886 --> 14:08.306
Sir Pentious!
Welcome to the Hazbin hotel!

14:08.306 --> 14:13.228
Oh, no darling, thank you.
You won't regret this.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.106
Eh, I give you a week tops.

14:16.106 --> 14:21.570
So... this
is the bar and the bartender.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.530
This is the curtain,

14:23.530 --> 14:26.449
and this is the new wall after
you broke the last one, heh,

14:26.449 --> 14:28.159
and, oh, this, this is--

14:28.159 --> 14:30.161
Babe, you don't have to show him
every detail.

14:30.161 --> 14:34.916
Sorry, I'm just so excited to
have our first real guest!

14:34.916 --> 14:37.085
Uh, what the hell am I then?

14:37.085 --> 14:40.422
Well, you're an important part
of our family here, Angel.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.174
But you, um, uh...

14:43.174 --> 14:45.927
Constantly make us look
bad, sexually harass the staff,

14:45.927 --> 14:48.305
and have literally
never once tried to improve?

14:48.305 --> 14:53.476
What she means is, it's just nice
to have someone interested for once.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.565
Over here we have our maid
Niffty.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.276
The bad boy is back.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.069
Never leave me again.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.322
We're about eighty percent
sure she's harmless.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.073
And over here we have--

15:07.073 --> 15:10.952
Oh, uh, Alastor, our gracious
Facility Manager!

15:10.952 --> 15:15.290
You've met our newest guest,
Sir Pentious... Heh heh.

15:15.290 --> 15:18.460
Ah, yes. You're
the one who ruined my coat.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.713
I definitely remember you now.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.635
Well, I guess this is a great
time for your first lesson:

15:27.636 --> 15:30.096
"How to apologize".

15:30.096 --> 15:32.474
The first step to becoming a better
person is to admit when you are wrong,

15:32.474 --> 15:35.018
Why don't you give it a try?

15:35.018 --> 15:43.068
Yes, um... Mr, um, Radio Demon,
sir, please forgive me for attacking you

15:43.068 --> 15:47.238
and ruining your very
lovely coat... Um, here...

15:47.238 --> 15:52.661
Oh-ho, not many people have
been able to take even this much off me.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.621
It must have
meant quite a lot to you.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.629
Now! With a new resident,

16:02.629 --> 16:05.298
I think it's important
we all get to know each other,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.717
so we are going to play
a little game.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.552
Everyone, follow me.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.013
My name is Charlie.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.182
I like to sing.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.060
And when we get to know
each other, it's the greatest thing.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.689
My name's Sir Pentious.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.399
I like to build.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.359
And despite my stupid Egg Bois,

16:24.359 --> 16:26.444
I think I'm very skilled.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.531
This is stupid.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.724
"Now, where's an innocent kid I
can sell crack to?"

16:56.516 --> 16:58.727
Wow. Who wrote this?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.812
It's great, right?
Keep going.

17:00.812 --> 17:05.191
-"Hey you."
- Who, me?

17:05.191 --> 17:09.738
"Yeah, you look like a kid
who could use some devil's dandruff."

17:09.738 --> 17:11.614
Oh, for fuck's sake.

17:11.614 --> 17:15.702
Not me. I have
to go home and study.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.998
"Come on kid,
it'll make you cool like me...

17:20.707 --> 17:22.417
The crack head!"

17:22.417 --> 17:27.255
The only cool thing here
is to say no to drugs.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.424
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:29.424 --> 17:34.429
I'm off to not have sexual
intercourse before marriage!

17:34.429 --> 17:39.476
Yes! Oh, bravo, bravo!

17:39.476 --> 17:41.227
Wow, Pentious,

17:41.227 --> 17:43.605
at this rate you'll be redeemed
in no time.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.442
I... I'm going to bed.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.404
I am so
proud of you, Sir Pentious.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.448
- That was amazing.
- Thank you.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.574
- That was beautiful work today!
- Thank you.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.077
