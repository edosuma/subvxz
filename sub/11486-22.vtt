00:01.560 --> 00:04.279
Charlie? Where's Charlie?

00:04.480 --> 00:05.913
Check the living room.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.799
- Charlie, guess what?
- Somebody call me?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.752
Not me.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.234
He's not in the living room.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.032
- Try his bedroom.
- Thanks.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.758
Charlie, you gotta see this.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.713
Are you sure nobody's calling me?

00:20.440 --> 00:21.714
Wouldn't I tell you?

00:24.520 --> 00:26.511
Berta, he's not in his room.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.513
- What?
- I said, he's not in his room.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.473
What?

00:32.960 --> 00:35.269
- Did you find him?
- He's not up there.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.194
- Try Jake's room.
- What'd he be doing in Jake's room?

00:38.400 --> 00:40.118
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.552
I'm sorry. Charlie!

00:44.320 --> 00:46.038
I'm sure I heard something.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.835
I don't know what to tell you.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.554
I could do this all day.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.354
Charlie.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.794
Hey, Alan.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.793
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- Oh, that was you.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.070
Of course it was me.
Who else would it be?

01:15.280 --> 01:16.838
Don't snap at me.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.956
I've been running all over
looking for you.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.394
Well, I was right here.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.074
I know that now.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.476
Hey, that's no reason
to have a hissy fit.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.598
Hissy fit? This is not a hissy fit.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.510
Say it higher, Alan. A couple of dogs
in the neighborhood didn't hear you.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.992
I'm all done. I'm going home now.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.434
- Thank you.
- Good night.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.036
Good night, my pets.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.599
Now that you've managed to find me,
what do you want?

01:43.760 --> 01:46.991
There was something I was excited
to show you, but now I don't want to.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.594
- I'm okay with that.
- So am I.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.352
Oh, come on. You gotta see this.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.476
All right. Fine.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.718
Hey. Wait a minute.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.677
Did Berta know you were out here?

01:58.840 --> 02:01.638
Very mature, Alan. Blame the maid.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.713
Oh, you bought a Porsche.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.556
"Porsche." What do you think?

02:13.240 --> 02:14.593
It's cute.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.154
What do you mean, cute?

02:16.320 --> 02:18.834
I mean, it looks like my car's
hot little girlfriend.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.110
Are you saying this is a chick car?
Because it isn't. It's a Porsche.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.919
Yeah. The cute little one.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.511
No, no, no. It's the sporty one.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.511
If your sport is girls' basketball.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.475
No, no, it's got the fuel injection,
and the rack and the pinion...

02:35.640 --> 02:37.949
...and the leather thingy
to cover the hood.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.032
That's called a bra, Alan.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.834
Yeah, but it's made of leather.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.354
- All right. Whatever.
- It is not a chick car.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.557
The salesman showed me brochures
with pictures of guys driving it.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.395
Alan, if a monkey walked
into the dealership...

02:52.560 --> 02:55.199
...he'd have been shown
pictures of monkeys driving it.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.110
Monkeys can't drive a stick.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.150
Now, come on.
We'll go for a spin, pick up Jake.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.436
Where'd you get the money for this?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.589
Where'd you get it...

03:06.760 --> 03:09.752
...because they're not cheap.
- No, no, they are not.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.712
Where'd you get the money for this?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.752
The money. Where'd you get it?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.275
Oh, I got it from...

03:21.960 --> 03:25.111
- What?
- I got a loan from...

03:28.000 --> 03:30.036
Alan, where'd the money come from?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.716
I found it.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.795
- Alan?
- Mom.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.030
You traded your soul for a Porsche.

03:38.200 --> 03:42.239
I didn't trade my soul,
and it's "Porsche."

03:43.640 --> 03:45.153
Alan, why didn't you come to me?

03:45.320 --> 03:46.878
No, I already owe you so much.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.679
You won't let me pay rent
and you pay all the utilities.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.996
Keeping that in mind,
did you ever consider...

03:52.160 --> 03:54.754
...taking the money from Mom
and paying me back?

03:57.960 --> 03:59.712
No, not really.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.716
Come on. Let me show you
what this baby can do.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.349
Well, what do you know?
Monkeys can drive a stick.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.795
You know, the salesman was right.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.269
You really do feel special
in one of these things.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.398
Oh, yeah. Probably not a lot
of middle-aged, divorced guys...

04:23.560 --> 04:25.755
...driving around L.A. In a Porsche.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.350
"Porsche."

04:28.520 --> 04:30.715
Oh, wait, I forgot to show you
the best part.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.438
Alan, that's a NASCAR hat.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.636
Yeah, they were
out of the Porsche hats.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.917
I wanted something that said speed
and performance, so I got this.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.914
What you should be wearing
is a hat with a propeller on top.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.078
Come on, open her up.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.276
The first 1000 miles
is the break-in period.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.237
You're not supposed to go over 65.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.799
Well, then go 65.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.349
The speed limit is 60.
You want me to get a ticket?

04:58.520 --> 05:00.875
Alan, you're driving
an expensive red sports car.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.396
If you're not getting tickets and tail,
you might as well take the bus.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.994
Which, by the way, just passed us.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.071
I am going plenty fast,
thank you very much.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.832
Can we at least put the top down?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.356
No, I wanna trap the new-car smell in
as long as I can.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.954
Man, are you anal-retentive.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.999
You need a bumper sticker that reads,
"My other car is a puckered rectum."

05:24.040 --> 05:28.192
Oh, yeah. Like I'd desecrate this car
with a bumper sticker.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.270
God, I love that sound.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.035
Will you stop it?

05:56.040 --> 05:59.316
Jake, your dad's here.
Where's your car?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.869
Oh, my car? My car is...

06:04.040 --> 06:05.314
...right there.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.153
- You got a Porsche?
- "Porsche."

06:09.440 --> 06:12.716
I have to struggle to make ends meet,
and you can buy a Porsche?

06:15.400 --> 06:18.198
What are you talking about?
Your ends have not only met...

06:18.360 --> 06:20.954
...they've been to Hawaii
and remodeled the kitchen.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.714
Don't change the subject.
How can you afford a fancy car?

06:24.280 --> 06:26.510
Well, I can't afford it, really.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.312
Maybe I have to call my attorney.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.233
And re-examine our whole
alimony/child-support agreement.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.197
No, no, you don't.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.960
It wasn't very expensive.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.390
This is the girl version. Right, Charlie?

06:40.560 --> 06:44.712
Oh, yeah, yeah. You've gotta kiss it
before you can even stick the key in.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.316
Judith, you have nothing to worry about.
You've successfully sucked me dry.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.040
Absolutely. This guy's farting dust.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.555
Then where'd he get
the money for the car?

06:54.440 --> 06:55.873
He borrowed it from our mother.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.270
Give me a break.
Even Alan's not that stupid.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.953
Oh, but he is.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.475
I am. I swear to God.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.830
- Hey, cool car. Is it yours?
- Yeah.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.829
We're gonna have to talk
about my allowance.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.391
Okay, well, have a nice weekend.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.679
Wait a minute. That's a two-seater.
Where's he gonna sit?

07:24.560 --> 07:27.199
And you didn't believe
he was that stupid.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.919
We're going way over
the speed limit.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.959
Let me worry about that.
You just keep looking for cops.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.872
I don't usually take a cab.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.796
I drive a red Boxster.
You know, Porsche.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.675
- Those are very nice.
- Thank you.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.910
My sister has one.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.959
- Hey, Berta. You seen my brother?
- Did you check his room?

08:09.320 --> 08:10.833
Thanks.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.559
Sweetie, it is a beautiful car.
Congratulations.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.474
- Thanks, Mom. I'm really enjoying it.
- Well, your Aunt Sylvia loves hers.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.519
Berta, have you seen Charlie?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.033
Look out on the deck.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.390
- I was looking for you.
- I was in the garage.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.755
- I was looking for you.
- I was looking for Alan.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.477
I was in the garage.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.793
Okay. Bye.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.154
Oh, sure. Blame the maid.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.348
Oh, Alan, before I forget,
I need to ask you for a little favor.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.358
Your soul, please.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.677
Charlie, for God's sake...

08:52.840 --> 08:55.274
Careful. I don't think
you're allowed to say "God"...

08:55.440 --> 08:57.590
...without bursting into flames
or something.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.640
Shush with your antichrist humor.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.950
It's getting old.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.793
Alan, I'd like you to join me
for dinner tomorrow night.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.918
- Why?
- I'm dating a man I'd like you to meet.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.834
And?

09:11.040 --> 09:13.508
He has a lovely daughter about your age.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.750
Sayeth the serpent.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.116
No. Mom, please, please,
please, no blind dates.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.398
Why not? She's a sweet girl
and I think you might really hit it off.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.115
- Why can't Charlie go out with her?
- Hey, she didn't buy me a car.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.798
This has absolutely nothing
to do with the car.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.309
Besides, I want
to get closer to this man.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.829
Should the time come
when I want an ugly breakup...

09:38.000 --> 09:40.468
...I'll let you
take a crack at his daughter.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.358
I'm sorry, Mom. But I'd rather not.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.398
Alan, I bought you a car.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.520
I love the smell of brimstone
in the morning.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.077
Tomorrow night, 8:00, Le Pissoir.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.800
- I really appreciate this, darling.
- Sure.

09:58.960 --> 10:03.112
Oh, one more thing. She's been
through a rough patch lately...

10:03.280 --> 10:05.999
...so we won't be ordering alcohol.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.195
Bye-bye.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.473
No, really. She sounds great.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.233
Looks like my mom and your dad
are running a little late.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.832
Typical.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.511
Yeah. So you're in town
for the weekend. Where do you live?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.957
Palm Springs.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.236
That's nice.
How long have you lived there?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.630
Forty-two days, so far.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.039
Forty-two days?

10:47.680 --> 10:50.638
Yeah. This is my first weekend pass.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.753
I was supposed to get one at 30,
but I bit a guy.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.713
- Would you like a cocktail?
- No, no, no cocktails. No.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.394
- No, that's all right. You can have one.
- No, I'm fine.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.630
- Oh, please. Go ahead.
- No. I don't think...

11:06.800 --> 11:09.837
Order a drink, damn it.
I wanna smell it.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.597
We're fine. Maybe just a fizzy water.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.393
So, what do you do?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.679
I'm a chiropractor.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.917
Really? Can you prescribe stuff?

11:25.640 --> 11:27.119
No.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.633
Did you hear that?

11:34.040 --> 11:37.396
- It's my phone.
- Oh, thank God.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.670
Hello? Oh, hey, Mom. Where are you?

11:42.840 --> 11:44.831
Yes, she's here.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.710
Yes, very sweet. Where are you?

11:51.560 --> 11:53.312
Trudy, Trudy, there's no smoking.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.119
Oh, that's just great.
Just jim-freaking-dandy.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.679
You guys are coming, right?
Well, what am I supposed to do?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.956
Yes, I know you bought me a car.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.833
All right, all right. All right. Goodbye.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.952
Apparently, your father mixed up
his heart pills with his Viagra...

12:17.120 --> 12:19.350
...and they didn't wanna
waste the opportunity.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.353
So he's not coming?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.557
Well...

12:25.280 --> 12:28.272
Perfect. Just perfect.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.477
That son of a bitch
never cared about me.

12:31.640 --> 12:32.914
Trudy, Trudy...

12:33.840 --> 12:37.992
He'd rather spend the night
with some old hose bag.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.277
That old hose bag is my mother...

12:42.440 --> 12:45.000
...and there's still no smoking in here.
I'm sorry.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.232
Careful. I bit the last guy
who tried to touch me.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.959
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
we can't have a nice meal.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.674
I'll call the waiter.

12:59.440 --> 13:03.228
Hello, hello.
Yeah, we're ready to order.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.951
Remind me to get some clean urine
from you before we go.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.313
- <i>Two hundred forty pounds...</i>
- What are you doing?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.472
Picking off the pepperonis.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.871
Then why'd you order it
with pepperonis?

13:25.240 --> 13:27.276
I like to stack them up
and eat them in bed.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.640
Hello? Hey, Mom.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.392
No, Dad's not here. He's on a date.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.634
Hang on. Uncle Charlie's talking to me.
Yeah?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.950
Don't tell your mom
your father's on a date.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.111
- It's none of her business.
- Okay.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.191
He's not on a date.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.275
Hang on. She wants to talk to you.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.836
Uncle Charlie's not here.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.838
Give me that.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.832
Hey, Judith. What's up?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.998
Well, he's not a bright kid.
What do you want from me?

14:05.120 --> 14:06.678
I don't know where Alan is.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.637
Would you like me
to give him a message?

14:08.800 --> 14:11.268
Because who knows?
Maybe this time I will.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.078
No message.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.511
How come it's a secret
Dad's on a date?

14:19.200 --> 14:23.113
It's not. It's just never a good idea to tell
women more than they need to know.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.753
How come?

14:24.920 --> 14:27.150
Because we love them
and want to protect them.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.117
A clueless woman is a happy woman.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.670
- Can I have your pepperonis?
- No.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.396
Batman!

14:45.720 --> 14:48.837
Come on. Come on, Trudy.
Come on. Come on.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.594
- Let's get you back to the Batcave...
- Oh, right.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.637
...or whatever cave
you crawled out of.

14:53.800 --> 14:58.555
Thank you, kind sir.
You are indeed a gentleman.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.110
Allow me to reward you.

15:07.080 --> 15:12.791
A salty! I shall now need a slice of lime
and a carafe of tequila.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.237
No, thank you. No, no, we're fine.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.039
Hey, come on, Trudy.
Let's take you home.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.988
Okay. But we'll have to be
really quiet...

15:22.160 --> 15:26.278
...because my roommate is detoxing,
so she's kind of a light sleeper.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.510
No, no, I meant home to your father.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.875
Oh, God.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.110
Daddy!

15:34.280 --> 15:39.798
Oh, I'm such a disappointment to you.

15:39.960 --> 15:44.238
Hey, your aftershave has alcohol in it.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.838
So why is Dad's car a chick car?

15:55.800 --> 15:58.439
It's not really. I was just saying that
to bust his chops.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.590
Chops are your nuts, right?

16:04.320 --> 16:05.753
Right.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.076
Mom said it's a midlife-crisis car.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.917
Well, she was bound to be right
about something eventually.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.558
What's a midlife crisis?

16:17.800 --> 16:21.270
Well, Jake, it's when a man
starts facing his own mortality...

16:21.440 --> 16:23.670
...and tries to recapture his youth.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.516
I've had one of those.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.552
Do tell.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.718
Life was so much simpler
when I was 6.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.157
Hello? Hey, Dad.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.709
Listen, don't worry
about your midlife crisis.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.758
They usually go away
over summer vacation.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.954
He wants to talk to you.
Are you here?

16:50.960 --> 16:54.316
Yeah. Whoa, slow down.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.391
Well, how drunk is she?

16:57.640 --> 17:00.598
Really? Batman drunk?

17:02.760 --> 17:05.069
Well, just dump her
with Mom and her father.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.593
Where are they?

17:07.880 --> 17:09.757
Viagra and a bad ticker.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.480
Mom loses more boyfriends that way.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.791
Alan, calm down, calm down.
Listen to me. Here's what you do:

17:15.960 --> 17:17.439
Take her to a club...

17:17.599 --> 17:20.672
...pin a warning note on her back
as a courtesy to the next guy...

17:20.839 --> 17:22.796
...and run like hell.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.109
Well, if you don't want my advice,
why'd you call me?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.353
Okay, how about this:

17:29.520 --> 17:32.193
Put the top down
and let the night air sober her up.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.989
What's plan B?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.551
How come you don't have
a date tonight?

17:45.720 --> 17:47.517
I decided I'd rather hang out with you.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.352
- Really?
- No.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.597
You're saying that to bust my chops.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.759
No.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.110
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.271
- How was your date?
- Oh, lots of fun.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.994
- Think you'll marry her?
- Doubtful. Charlie?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.068
What happened?
You take her to a club and ditch her?

18:09.240 --> 18:10.753
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.558
Well, it's cheesy and immoral...

18:12.720 --> 18:15.917
...and I'm really not comfortable
having some valet touch my car.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.477
- So where is she?
- In the garage.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.358
- Oh, Alan.
- Well, she passed out.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.398
- I figured I'd let her sleep it off.
- You left her in your car?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.073
Why not?

18:39.480 --> 18:41.516
Well, at least she left
the garage door open.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.352
It's a red Porsche Boxster
with dealer plates.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.235
"Porsche."
Yeah, about an hour ago.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.073
Hey, Dad, check it out.
Your car's on TV.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.231
I'll call you back.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.552
- <i>chase so far. The suspect was</i>
<i>first spotted in Malibu...</i>

19:09.720 --> 19:11.312
<i>... on the Pacific Coast Highway...</i>

19:11.480 --> 19:13.914
<i>... and is now southbound</i>
<i>on the 405 freeway.</i>

19:14.120 --> 19:15.519
Oh, God!

19:15.720 --> 19:19.156
Don't worry. I've watched
hundreds of these. They never make it.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.915
- <i>she just ran over the nail strips</i>
<i>that the Highway Patrol laid out.</i>

19:23.320 --> 19:25.470
Oh, man, look at the sparks.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.434
That's because
she's riding on rims, Jake.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.319
You gotta like
how your car handles without tires.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.592
Oh, God!

19:33.760 --> 19:35.398
<i>Whoa, that was a close call.</i>

19:35.560 --> 19:39.599
<i>She sideswiped that SUV</i>
<i>and kept right on going.</i>

19:39.760 --> 19:41.876
What's that dragging
alongside Dad's car?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.270
I think that's the door.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.717
- Cool.
- Oh, God!

19:47.880 --> 19:50.758
<i>Dale, this is Trish in the studio.</i>
<i>Can you see the suspect?</i>

19:50.920 --> 19:52.353
<i>How do you know it's a woman?</i>

19:52.520 --> 19:54.909
<i>Well, Trish, we actually</i>
<i>don 't know it's a woman...</i>

19:55.080 --> 19:58.914
<i>... but thought it was a safe bet</i>
<i>based on the type of car.</i>

19:59.120 --> 20:02.271
It's not a chick car.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.832
Relax, Dad.
He's just busting your chops.
