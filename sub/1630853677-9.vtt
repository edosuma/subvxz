00:09.718 --> 00:11.720
MAGGIE:
<i>Well, business is not booming.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:13.472
<i>No one seems to know I'm a psychic.</i>

00:13.472 --> 00:17.267
- What about a big sign
that just says, "Vision."

00:17.267 --> 00:20.145
- Mm-mm, that makes it sound
like she's an optometrist.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.397
What about a sign that says,

00:22.397 --> 00:25.275
"We help you see things better"?

00:25.275 --> 00:27.569
Mm-hm? Mm?

00:27.569 --> 00:30.489
- Perfect Podiatry, your call is
super important to us, please hold.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.783
So, whose idea do you like better?

00:32.783 --> 00:35.744
- Gosh, I don't know.
They're so different.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.038
Mm, well, you gotta
put yourself out there.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.750
- Maybe I'll just put a bunch
of mystical stuff in the window.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.044
- Ah, you know what?
I have the perfect thing.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.214
I have an old cast of Val Kilmer's foot
that's ripe for the taking.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.133
Course, you can't say it's Val Kilmer's
because of HIPAA and all of that,

00:50.133 --> 00:52.719
but people who know will know.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.054
Why don't you just
come to the house tonight,

00:54.054 --> 00:55.430
and we can go through the attic.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.015
I'll show you
my porcelain doll collection,

00:57.015 --> 00:59.142
and you can take the ones
whose eyes are missing.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.561
Ooh.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.169
Hi. Is this the Bail Bonds office?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.546
Hey. Y'all do hair?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.257
Do you do waxing?

01:35.804 --> 01:38.432
- Well, at least this is something
I'm, like, semi-good at,

01:38.432 --> 01:40.517
but are you sure
you don't want a reading?

01:40.517 --> 01:44.271
- Oh, I'm good. I know my ex
will come crawling back eventually.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.609
Can't believe this is a psychic shop.
Why don't you have a sign?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.945
- What, like a big sign
that says "Maggie"?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.907
- It's not really me.
- Isn't that, literally, your name?

01:54.907 --> 01:58.577
- Yeah, but, like, my name in lights?
Who am I? Las Vegas.

01:58.577 --> 01:59.703
Okay.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.748
Ooh, what about a window display?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.625
Think of a theme like I did with my condo.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.627
I chose the color purple.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.630
- What, like the movie,
or the actual color?

02:10.339 --> 02:12.174
Do you even have to ask?

02:12.883 --> 02:15.093
So, like, the movie then?

02:16.678 --> 02:17.971
♪

02:23.560 --> 02:25.354
Why do you have your
"menu-reading face" on?

02:25.354 --> 02:27.898
- Oh, I haven't seen
this picture in forever.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.650
This is me with my old band.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.026
Whoa.

02:31.026 --> 02:31.860
Whenever you mentioned them,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.737
I always pictured
the Country Bear Jamboree,

02:33.737 --> 02:36.323
but look at you.
You're a badass.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.910
- Yeah, I used to be able to jump
into the splits... Both ways.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.372
- That's who I used to be.
- What happened?

02:43.372 --> 02:46.250
- Oh, if you don't stretch every day,
you kinda lose it.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.001
No, to the band.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.629
- I kept it up for a while,
but when I had you,

02:50.629 --> 02:53.215
I decided it was time
to let that dream go.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.133
That's when I became Dad's receptionist.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.635
You gave up your dream for me?

02:56.635 --> 02:59.221
- No.
Things change when you have a kid.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.473
Now all I want is
for your dreams to come true.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.309
- Well, I'll have you know
my dream has come true.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.687
I run my own psychic shop
where half the people who come in

03:06.687 --> 03:08.397
ask where the weed's at?

03:08.397 --> 03:11.066
- Oh, well, that's why
your dad and I get ours delivered.

03:11.066 --> 03:14.027
- Hm... Hey, maybe you
should start up the band again.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.655
Ah, those days are over,

03:16.655 --> 03:19.616
but I do miss having a creative outlet,

03:19.616 --> 03:20.951
and smashing things.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.871
What's gotten into you?
Why are you so encouraging?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.290
- I just feel bad that you
gave all that up for me.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.126
Look, I'm out of the house now,
but before I have to move back

03:29.126 --> 03:30.752
because my business goes under,

03:32.129 --> 03:34.590
you should find something
that's just for you.

03:34.590 --> 03:35.924
You're sweet.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.469
Oh! Here's me giving birth to you.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.889
- You wanna see?
- No, I remember the video.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.892
- Yeah, good call.
It looks like a crime scene.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.605
- Thanks for letting me
stay here today, guys.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.232
- Oh, no problem.
You said you had to leave your apartment.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.985
- What happened? Roaches, asbestos?
- Black mold?

03:54.985 --> 03:56.528
- Everyone's got a bit of black mold.
- Uck.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.030
It's like the HPV of rooms.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.783
- No, my roommate's moving out,
and I didn't want her to ask me to help.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.328
She'd rather live with her fiancé.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.163
- I hate her.
Did you find a replacement yet?

04:06.163 --> 04:08.957
- No, it's so hard
to find a good roommate.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.335
You think someone's a decent person
and then, bam!

04:11.335 --> 04:14.505
All of a sudden there's an <i>Entourage</i>
poster up in the living room wall.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.506
You know what?

04:15.506 --> 04:17.841
Our plant guy told me that
he needs a place to live.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.844
He just moved here from Portland.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.472
- Sorry, your what?
- Our plant guy.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.890
He keeps our plants alive.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.225
And one time, he brought me a tea.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.102
- Babe, go see if he's here.
- Mm.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.647
- Mm, I love this.
I love connecting people.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.982
- I love plants.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.944
- The CBD oil that I put
in this smoothie is really kickin' in.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.239
Woo! Oh my god.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.367
- Hi.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.160
- Hey, if you're looking
for a payday loan,

04:45.160 --> 04:48.247
you're gonna be the third person today
I have to break bad news to.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.999
- I was actually
coming in for a reading.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.628
- Oh, well... you know
my "no friends" policy,

04:54.628 --> 04:58.841
and that especially applies to you
because of the, you know, stuff.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.844
- Yeah, n-no. The reading's not for me.

05:01.844 --> 05:05.055
It's, um, actually... for this.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.559
- What tomb you'd
have to raid to get that?

05:09.059 --> 05:13.313
- So, I was at a flea market,
and I was weirdly drawn to this,

05:13.313 --> 05:15.899
and I have no idea why.

05:15.899 --> 05:19.069
- Well, it looks cool.
- Well, I was thinking maybe that you can

05:19.069 --> 05:21.697
touch it and see if there's
anything special about it.

05:21.697 --> 05:25.534
I would go on <i>Antiques Roadshow</i> ,
but it's not a walk-in situation.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.827
No.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.078
Please.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.122
- Let's give it a shot.
- Thank you.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.884
- Uh, yeah. I'm, I'm not really
seeing anything special.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.760
Just somebody flipping it.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.847
Not sure if it's heads or tails,
but it's definitely one of those.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.182
Oh.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.059
I never understood that,
leaving things to chance.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.021
- Well, flipping a coin isn't always
about leaving things to chance.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.190
Sometimes, it helps you
decide what you really want.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.526
- Well, if I know what I want,
then why would I be flipping a coin?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.155
- Let's say we're going to get froyo.
- Mm-hm.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.366
- Okay? And you can't decide
between vanilla and chocolate.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.493
Heads for vanilla,
tails for chocolate, okay?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.623
Which one do you want it to be?

06:12.623 --> 06:13.916
Tails.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.335
Mmm, so that's what you really want.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.336
Okay.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.755
S-So, what is it?

06:19.755 --> 06:21.465
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Why?

06:21.465 --> 06:25.469
- You have your answer, chocolate.
Which is also the best answer.

06:26.386 --> 06:30.516
- Hi, I need 300 copies of this
"Have You Seen My Dog" flyer.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.059
- Oh.
- He's not lost.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.228
It, it just links to his Instagram.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.398
- He wears wigs.
- Wait, I know this dog. I follow him.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.025
Yeah.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.028
Yeah, so I don't do this.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.239
It's just 300 copies.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.657
CLIENT:
Yeah.

06:46.657 --> 06:50.035
- Lou, I really think our plant guy
would be an amazing roommate for you.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.371
Just don't bring up aphids
'cause he gets pretty heated.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.540
- Okay, well, I just hope
you pay this guy well

06:54.540 --> 06:57.042
because my rent is, kind of--

06:58.210 --> 06:59.753
Hi.
Hey, hey.

07:01.088 --> 07:01.922
What?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.759
Ooh, Dad, that is a brisk walk.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.387
If you need to use the bathroom
without a reading, that'll be a dollar.

07:08.387 --> 07:12.349
- Okay, Maggie, I'm in no mood.
Thanks to you, your mother is leaving me.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.560
- What?!
- Yeah.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.354
After 30 years, she doesn't
want to be my receptionist anymore.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.899
- Mom quit?
- Well, she said it was your idea.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.902
I can't run that office by myself, Maggie.

07:23.902 --> 07:27.072
What, I'm supposed to hire somebody
I'm not married to to be my receptionist?

07:27.072 --> 07:30.576
- How would that even work?
- Well, why don't you just talk to her?

07:30.576 --> 07:33.954
- Talk to her?
Honey, I can't even look at her right now.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.956
Oh, that's your mom.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.749
She's waiting for me in the car.
I gotta go.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.878
Oh boy.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.175
MAGGIE:
Uh, Mom, so what happened?

07:46.175 --> 07:48.719
I thought you'd get a hobby,
not quit your job.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.095
After our talk, I thought about it,

07:50.095 --> 07:52.264
and I realized
I never loved working there.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.182
No?

07:53.182 --> 07:55.225
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Mm-hm.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.393
I don't like feet.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.020
That doesn't need to be a secret.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.022
- Wow.
- Yeah.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.149
My nails have never looked better.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.818
I look like a badass.
You're onto somethin', kiddo.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.153
- Mm-hm. You're onto something.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.281
No, but seriously,
if you were feeling that unfulfilled,

08:09.281 --> 08:11.700
then quitting was
definitely the right move.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.203
You're owning who you are.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.996
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Mm-hm.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.039
I like the new me.

08:17.039 --> 08:20.751
- Do you want me to do your toes?
- Oh, no, no. Your dad likes to do those.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.504
Okay, that should be a secret.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.716
Champagne was a great call.
What's the occasion?

08:27.716 --> 08:28.759
My roommate left it behind,

08:28.759 --> 08:30.511
and I'm nervous she's
gonna come back for it.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.262
- Ooh, smart.
- Yeah, drink up.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.015
So, how's the roommate search going?

08:35.641 --> 08:37.059
Complicated.

08:37.059 --> 08:39.645
Amy and Dave introduced me
to their plant guy.

08:39.645 --> 08:40.938
Plot twist, he's hot.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.066
So now I can't tell if he'd make
a better roommate or boyfriend.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.400
Well, he can't be both.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.195
I mean, what if you guys break up
and then you're stuck living together?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.113
- Oof.
- Okay, well, devil's advocate.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.824
What if we're the two people
in the world that can make it work

08:52.824 --> 08:55.786
because we're... extremely mature?

08:55.786 --> 08:58.455
Well as much as I do believe that,

08:58.455 --> 09:00.457
maybe you should decide
once you get to know him better.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.084
Starting with his name?

09:02.084 --> 09:05.587
- They just call him "Plant Guy."
It's like Prince or Roseanne.

09:06.547 --> 09:10.008
Speaking of names, have people
figured out what your storefront is yet?

09:10.008 --> 09:13.220
Mmm... Not really, no.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.473
But maybe it's cool if
I keep it kinda mysterious.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.685
You know, like a speakeasy,
or a high-end sneaker store.

09:19.685 --> 09:23.105
- Maggie, psychic readings
are supposed to be mysterious.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.941
Your ability to help people is not.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.151
Let people know who you are.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.864
You know who I am. Isn't that enough?

09:31.864 --> 09:35.701
- Okay, your name is Maggie.
Your favorite color is terracotta.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.411
Your hall pass is Clive Owen.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.745
Hm, and you're Louise.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.665
Your favorite color is pink
and your hall pass is Mufasa.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.625
Ugh, it's the voice.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.669
- Mm.
- And he's so powerful in that movie.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.047
- Everything the sun touches is his.
- Mm-hm.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.300
Mm... cheers to being known.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.802
I'll drink to that.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.306
♪

09:58.932 --> 09:59.933
Mom?

10:01.143 --> 10:02.269
Whatcha doin' here?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.771
- Well, I thought about what you said...
- Uh-huh.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.691
- ...and I found just
the right career for myself.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.610
- That's great.
- Came to me like that.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.404
- Love it.
