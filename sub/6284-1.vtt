00:54.024 --> 00:57.065
In 7th century China, the Tang Dynasty is in decline.

00:57.107 --> 00:59.982
The Imperial Court seeks to protect itself

01:00.024 --> 01:02.940
by establishing garrisons at the frontiers of its empire.

01:02.982 --> 01:05.024
Two centuries later,

01:05.065 --> 01:09.190
the militarized provinces waver in their loyalty to the Court.

01:09.232 --> 01:12.232
Some move to distance themselves
from the Emperor's control.

01:12.274 --> 01:15.107
At that time, Weibo asserts itself
as the strongest of those provinces.

01:44.899 --> 01:47.440
That man poisoned his own father,

01:47.815 --> 01:49.774
he killed his own brother.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.607
His guilt condemns him.

01:56.440 --> 02:00.065
Cut him down for me, expertly.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.357
As if he were a bird in flight.

03:45.274 --> 03:46.940
Don't pinch it!

03:57.607 --> 03:58.940
Where's it going?

04:02.149 --> 04:04.232
Where does it fly to?

04:07.982 --> 04:09.399
Where indeed?

04:15.732 --> 04:18.315
I want to touch it.

04:23.649 --> 04:25.607
Where's it going?

04:27.524 --> 04:29.065
Where's it going?

04:32.732 --> 04:35.232
Play with the ball.

06:55.107 --> 06:57.565
Why did it take you so long?

06:58.690 --> 07:00.857
The governor's son was there.

07:01.232 --> 07:03.274
I could not bring myself to do it.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.149
Another time,

07:07.649 --> 07:09.440
first kill the one he loves,

07:09.649 --> 07:11.315
and then the man himself.

07:25.649 --> 07:27.440
You have mastered the sword

07:27.690 --> 07:29.482
but your heart lacks resolve.

07:29.857 --> 07:31.649
I shall return you to Weibo

07:31.857 --> 07:33.524
to kill your cousin

07:34.149 --> 07:36.065
Tian Ji'an.

08:06.357 --> 08:19.607
The Assassin

09:17.524 --> 09:19.190
My lady,

09:19.399 --> 09:21.649
a nun is here.

09:21.899 --> 09:26.107
She says she is bringing Yinniang back.

09:55.857 --> 09:58.690
As your humble servant,

09:59.357 --> 10:01.357
I bow to you, Your Reverence.

10:06.024 --> 10:07.857
Yinniang has completed her studies.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.982
Today she returns.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.357
I'll take my leave of you.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.190
The King of Kophen's bluebird

13:39.899 --> 13:42.274
failed to sing for three years.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.899
One day the Queen remarked :

13:46.107 --> 13:49.315
Birds sing only to their own kind,

13:49.524 --> 13:51.690
set the bird before a mirror!

13:58.482 --> 14:00.524
The King heeded her advice.

14:01.857 --> 14:03.774
The bluebird saw its own image,

14:05.274 --> 14:06.982
it sang of its sadness,

14:08.940 --> 14:10.565
it danced,

14:12.774 --> 14:14.357
until it expired.

14:31.107 --> 14:34.107
Yinniang, these clothes are for you.

14:34.315 --> 14:36.774
While you were away with the nun,

14:37.232 --> 14:39.524
your mother made them for you herself,

14:39.690 --> 14:42.065
every spring and autumn.

16:27.357 --> 16:29.482
Grandmother, my respects.

16:31.107 --> 16:33.274
Rise.

17:08.315 --> 17:10.357
This is from your Master.

17:11.065 --> 17:13.732
She asked the tea-traders to bring it here.

17:30.107 --> 17:31.774
This jade was given

17:32.274 --> 17:34.524
to Princess Jiacheng

17:34.774 --> 17:37.315
when she was obliged to marry the Lord of Weibo.

17:37.899 --> 17:42.357
Her brother the Emperor offered it as a farewell gift.

17:48.149 --> 17:49.524
This jade

17:50.524 --> 17:52.857
symbolizes a decisive break.

17:55.065 --> 17:57.815
His Majesty was commanding her

17:58.690 --> 18:02.774
to depart from his Court and to secure Weibo.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.899
To prevent Weibo

18:06.357 --> 18:08.899
from invading His Majesty's lands.

18:17.190 --> 18:19.482
That year, your uncle and I

18:19.524 --> 18:22.315
were in charge of ceremonial protocol.

18:25.232 --> 18:26.982
I recall

18:27.940 --> 18:31.899
that the princess refused her usual carriage.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.399
So His Majesty gave her an Imperial gold carriage.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.899
When Princess Jiacheng reached Weibo,

18:44.149 --> 18:47.440
she abandoned all her former customs

18:47.982 --> 18:50.774
and adapted to the manners of Weibo.

18:52.357 --> 18:57.232
She sent away the retinue of staff provided by His Majesty.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.524
She lavished gold and silk on them,

19:03.065 --> 19:07.024
so that they could have their freedom.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.524
Since then,

19:11.440 --> 19:13.774
the Court is the Court

19:14.399 --> 19:16.524
and Weibo is Weibo.

19:20.607 --> 19:23.857
The Princess implemented that decisive break.

19:31.149 --> 19:33.399
When her son Ti'an Ji'an came of age,

19:34.024 --> 19:36.232
she divided two matching jades:

19:36.940 --> 19:38.982
One to her son, one to you.

19:40.607 --> 19:45.024
She wished the two of you to maintain the imperial edict.

19:46.190 --> 19:48.149
To be resolute

19:48.815 --> 19:52.732
in preserving the peace between the Imperial Court and Weibo.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.815
His Majesty passed away four years ago.

20:02.857 --> 20:07.065
One year later, his nephew and heir also passed away.

20:08.899 --> 20:13.607
When the imperial messenger brought the sad news,

20:15.440 --> 20:17.649
Princess Jiacheng coughed up blood

20:18.649 --> 20:20.899
and hurled her pearls and jades

20:22.190 --> 20:24.149
to the ground.

20:27.065 --> 20:28.357
That year,

20:29.190 --> 20:31.149
the glorious white peonies

20:31.190 --> 20:33.690
she brought from the Court

20:35.315 --> 20:38.357
withered overnight.

20:45.774 --> 20:48.315
The Princess had one last concern.

20:51.982 --> 20:54.440
Her heart was troubled by the thought...

20:59.232 --> 21:01.982
that she had let you down.

21:43.065 --> 21:44.065
A year ago.

21:44.232 --> 21:46.899
The Court sent an official to Chengde

21:47.190 --> 21:49.732
to console Wang Chengzong

21:49.899 --> 21:52.274
for his father's death.

21:52.524 --> 21:56.774
He persuaded Wang to pay
the Court taxes on salt and iron

21:56.982 --> 22:00.315
and give away two provinces for a promotion.

22:00.524 --> 22:04.857
The Court immediately established in these two provinces

22:04.899 --> 22:07.607
the Baoxin Garrison.

22:07.815 --> 22:12.024
Lord Tian, you have a man in Chengde,

22:12.065 --> 22:13.774
seeding trouble between
Wang and Xue Changchao.

22:13.815 --> 22:18.232
He tells Wang that Xue has secret dealings with the Court.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.982
That will goad Wang

22:21.024 --> 22:22.524
into capturing Xue,

22:22.732 --> 22:26.232
so Xue will not be able to receive his promotion!

22:28.065 --> 22:31.399
This plan must be curtailed!

22:31.607 --> 22:33.107
At the moment,

22:33.274 --> 22:37.690
the Imperial Court is actively extending its domain.

22:37.899 --> 22:40.524
The Court will certainly be offended

22:40.815 --> 22:44.815
and send troops into Weibo!

22:45.024 --> 22:47.774
Their new provinces adjoin Weibo,

22:48.024 --> 22:50.940
and it is where they built their new garrison.

22:51.149 --> 22:55.440
The Court is showing off
its strength to intimidate us in Weibo.

22:55.690 --> 22:58.815
It is time to act.

22:59.024 --> 23:01.524
The Court could take Weibo

23:01.774 --> 23:06.565
as easily as it took the Wushu provinces.

23:09.065 --> 23:13.149
It will not be so easy to seize Weibo.

23:13.649 --> 23:15.899
We are not like Wushu.

23:18.232 --> 23:20.107
The Wushu garrison

23:20.274 --> 23:23.732
was encircled by the Court.

23:24.024 --> 23:26.649
Their rulers behaved as autocrats

23:27.315 --> 23:32.524
and commanded no popular support!

23:33.065 --> 23:33.899
Thus,

23:34.065 --> 23:38.357
the population instantly ceded to the Court's army.

23:40.482 --> 23:42.732
There is no comparison with Weibo.

23:43.107 --> 23:47.690
Our fifty-year history has forged bonds

23:48.357 --> 23:51.857
between ruler and ruled.

23:52.232 --> 23:53.315
Furthermore,

23:53.524 --> 23:57.482
even if Wang and Xue fall out,

23:57.732 --> 23:59.274
they are related by marriage.

23:59.482 --> 24:02.565
Their quarrel will not spill over borders.

24:03.149 --> 24:06.357
Xue Changchao has interests in Weibo.

24:06.607 --> 24:09.232
He does not always obey the Court.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.232
My lord,

24:11.482 --> 24:15.149
setting Wang against Xue

24:15.440 --> 24:19.232
would offend the Court and they will send troops.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.232
It will place Weibo in grave danger!

28:25.857 --> 28:27.690
Lord Tian is arriving.

28:41.732 --> 28:43.815
It was a woman in black.

28:44.065 --> 28:46.482
Your son saw her while he was playing.

28:47.940 --> 28:50.190
She seemed to mean him no harm.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.482
The guard says

31:13.815 --> 31:15.815
my brother will be banished.

31:16.899 --> 31:19.149
His blunt speaking caused offence.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.524
How is he?

31:25.149 --> 31:26.774
He had a stroke.

31:37.399 --> 31:38.899
Yinniang is back.

31:39.107 --> 31:40.565
I heard.

31:41.857 --> 31:44.649
The nun-princess brought her back.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.774
Lord Tian is here.

34:59.024 --> 35:01.149
You're thinking about that woman?

35:11.399 --> 35:13.982
Tian Xing will be sent away.

35:20.649 --> 35:23.482
He provoked panic. They all support the Court!

35:24.732 --> 35:27.149
Cowards, all of them!

39:27.774 --> 39:28.774
It was Yinniang.

39:30.524 --> 39:31.732
It was her.

39:44.024 --> 39:45.149
I understand.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.649
She wanted me to recognize her.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.440
Who?

39:55.607 --> 39:56.732
Yinniang.

39:57.440 --> 40:00.440
She wanted me to recognize her before taking my life.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.899
She wants me to know why.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.274
These jades were given...

40:37.190 --> 40:40.524
to my mother when she married into the Weibo clan.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.732
When I came of age,

40:44.190 --> 40:47.815
Mother gave one to me,one to Yinniang.

40:49.315 --> 40:50.732
One jade each,

40:51.357 --> 40:53.357
she betrothed us.

40:56.399 --> 41:00.524
Mother intended us to wed when Yinniang turned fifteen.

41:03.149 --> 41:04.107
The following year,

41:05.149 --> 41:06.565
Yuan, the Ming lord,

41:06.565 --> 41:08.649
formed an alliance with Weibo.

41:08.899 --> 41:11.940
Father wanted to cement
the alliance with a marriage.

41:16.524 --> 41:19.399
I was born to a concubine, Mother adopted me.

41:20.274 --> 41:22.982
To be sure that I would inherit Weibo.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.774
Mother betrayed her promise to Yinniang.

41:42.649 --> 41:44.274
Back then,

41:45.774 --> 41:48.649
Yinniang stayed in the forest.

41:51.899 --> 41:53.482
Like a phoenix!

41:54.899 --> 41:56.857
She broke into the Yuans' mansion.

41:57.399 --> 41:59.107
Their guards wounded her.

42:00.732 --> 42:02.440
She could have died.

42:07.149 --> 42:10.732
Mother asked her twin sister, Princess Jiaxin,

42:12.274 --> 42:15.315
to take Yinniang away.

42:37.899 --> 42:40.274
I feel for Yinniang.

43:05.399 --> 43:07.857
When I was ten I had a serious fever.

43:09.440 --> 43:11.524
The pain was unbearable.

43:13.649 --> 43:15.482
The doctors were no help.

43:16.065 --> 43:18.274
A small coffin was prepared.

43:20.690 --> 43:22.232
Yinniang's father suggested

43:22.440 --> 43:25.607
I be rolled in a bamboo mat

43:25.649 --> 43:27.649
and put in a cool spot.

43:28.315 --> 43:30.107
After three days and nights,

43:30.315 --> 43:31.815
I was cured.

43:37.815 --> 43:39.482
In my delirium,

43:41.190 --> 43:43.190
I sensed a presence.

43:44.024 --> 43:45.399
It was Yinniang.

43:46.607 --> 43:49.065
No one could have made her leave.

45:00.107 --> 45:01.232
Excuse me, sir,

45:01.440 --> 45:03.274
our guard has a report.

45:03.524 --> 45:04.899
Speak.

45:11.149 --> 45:12.440
Lord Provost,

45:12.649 --> 45:15.899
an assassin entered Lord Tian's mansion.

45:16.107 --> 45:18.774
Our guards are in pursuit.

45:19.232 --> 45:20.690
What is the situation?

45:21.232 --> 45:22.607
Nothing is certain.

45:29.107 --> 45:31.149
I withdraw.

45:41.732 --> 45:45.315
We should not have allowed the nun to take Yinniang away.

45:48.607 --> 45:50.440
What choice did we have?

45:51.857 --> 45:54.149
We had to save her somehow.

45:59.607 --> 46:01.399
Do you realize?

46:05.190 --> 46:06.524
Yinniang is back

46:06.690 --> 46:09.357
to kill Lord Tian on the orders of her Master!

46:32.357 --> 46:34.024
Provost,

46:34.482 --> 46:36.482
a messenger is here.

46:36.732 --> 46:41.524
Lord Tian urgently requires your presence.

47:47.232 --> 47:49.315
My Lord, the Provost is here.

47:49.690 --> 47:51.524
Your humble servant pays his respects.

47:54.690 --> 47:56.565
I sent for you,

47:56.732 --> 48:00.690
because I want you to escort
Commander Tian Xing to the border.

48:00.732 --> 48:07.232
Make sure he reaches it safely.

48:16.024 --> 48:17.357
My Lord,

48:18.399 --> 48:20.315
Tian Xing went home yesterday.

48:20.524 --> 48:22.440
He had a stroke.

48:25.107 --> 48:26.607
He's pretending.

48:31.899 --> 48:33.107
As you command.

48:35.065 --> 48:36.440
Uncle...

48:42.649 --> 48:44.649
Be ready for anything.

48:47.232 --> 48:51.524
Three years ago, his predecessor
was seized and buried alive.

48:52.107 --> 48:53.857
That must not happen again!

49:04.857 --> 49:06.440
Yinniang...

49:07.524 --> 49:09.774
returned home yesterday.

49:19.774 --> 49:21.774
We came face to face last night.

50:24.399 --> 50:26.065
As My Lady guessed,

50:26.274 --> 50:29.649
she faked her period with chicken blood.

50:33.399 --> 50:35.440
Lord Tian is here.

50:48.649 --> 50:52.774
Tell the nurse to fetch the boys.

51:05.982 --> 51:08.565
Jiang, show yourself!

51:16.690 --> 51:20.565
Yesterday, I ordered Tian Xing to leave.

51:21.065 --> 51:23.190
He has a new post.

51:24.357 --> 51:27.899
Just now, I ordered Provost Nie Feng

51:28.149 --> 51:31.149
to escort him.

51:33.857 --> 51:36.899
The incident of three years ago

51:37.399 --> 51:39.190
must not be repeated!

51:42.232 --> 51:43.357
Understood.

51:48.190 --> 51:50.565
I hear we had an intruder last night.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.732
The same woman in black?

51:55.649 --> 51:57.440
You are well informed!

54:22.482 --> 54:23.899
Travel safely!

55:42.399 --> 55:44.190
Bring Xiaomian here.

55:55.732 --> 55:57.065
Master,

55:57.607 --> 55:59.857
it is exactly as Madame guessed.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.524
Hui is pregnant.

56:01.732 --> 56:04.524
she faked her period with chicken blood.

56:36.440 --> 56:41.107
Commander Tian Xing will leave.
When it gets dark, go after him.

57:17.899 --> 57:18.732
What news?

57:18.774 --> 57:21.357
Tian Xing has left the staging post.

57:40.649 --> 57:43.274
They took a fork in the road.

57:43.315 --> 57:44.399
With Commander Tian?

57:44.607 --> 57:46.065
It was too dark to tell.

57:46.274 --> 57:47.899
Our man is chasing them.

1:06:20.565 --> 1:06:25.482
We should not have let the nun take you away.

1:15:32.232 --> 1:15:34.940
Princess Jiacheng taught me the zither.

1:15:37.107 --> 1:15:39.815
She told me a story about a bluebird's dance.

1:15:47.982 --> 1:15:50.482
She herself was the bluebird.

1:15:53.315 --> 1:15:57.899
She left the Court for Weibo all by herself.

1:16:00.107 --> 1:16:02.274
There was no one like her in Weibo.

1:24:46.399 --> 1:24:48.065
Come and help!

1:24:54.857 --> 1:24:56.107
Huji!

1:25:23.690 --> 1:25:25.440
Huji is pregnant.

1:27:09.982 --> 1:27:11.899
I found this in the corridor.

1:27:24.399 --> 1:27:27.774
My father showed me
one of these shortly before he died.

1:27:31.149 --> 1:27:34.899
When the Lord died suddenly in the night,

1:27:35.607 --> 1:27:37.774
one was found by his bed.

1:27:38.482 --> 1:27:40.899
Father suspected a plot by Princess Jiaxin.

1:27:41.149 --> 1:27:45.024
He traced her to a temple in the south,
where they spoke.

1:27:47.024 --> 1:27:49.065
She blamed him for his suspicions,

1:27:49.315 --> 1:27:52.024
saying she served the heavens, not evil spirits

1:27:52.232 --> 1:27:56.190
and such black magic just scares the simple-minded.

1:27:58.190 --> 1:27:59.982
In her opinion,

1:28:00.565 --> 1:28:02.940
the Lord died of fear.

1:28:03.690 --> 1:28:05.815
He scared himself to death.

1:29:31.732 --> 1:29:33.399
Lord Tian is here.

1:29:34.524 --> 1:29:36.399
Come here, boys!

1:30:37.399 --> 1:30:38.857
Sit.

1:30:41.149 --> 1:30:42.857
All of you.

1:30:59.357 --> 1:31:00.857
Rise!

1:31:11.482 --> 1:31:13.190
Clear this away.

1:31:47.065 --> 1:31:48.024
Reporting, sir!

1:31:48.315 --> 1:31:50.232
Commander Tian reached his post.

1:31:50.440 --> 1:31:53.190
And Provost Nie is recovering from his wounds.

1:31:53.232 --> 1:31:54.982
He remains weak,

1:31:55.024 --> 1:31:58.482
but will report to you himself tomorrow.

1:31:59.690 --> 1:32:00.815
My Lord,

1:32:01.024 --> 1:32:03.232
Wang Chengzong has sent 200 cavalrymen

1:32:03.482 --> 1:32:07.149
to arrest Xue Changchao.

1:32:08.607 --> 1:32:09.774
My Lord,

1:32:09.982 --> 1:32:12.024
if we behave aggressively

1:32:12.399 --> 1:32:15.024
and destroy the Imperial troops,

1:32:15.232 --> 1:32:18.274
the Court will mobilize

1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:20.107
against Weibo.

1:32:20.315 --> 1:32:24.190
I propose that we distract the Court's men

1:32:24.607 --> 1:32:26.815
by offering them food and wine.

1:32:27.024 --> 1:32:29.399
Meanwhile, we negotiate with Wang...

1:34:32.690 --> 1:34:36.190
Were Tian Ji'an to die while his sons are still young,

1:34:36.482 --> 1:34:38.065
Weibo would fall into chaos.

1:34:40.690 --> 1:34:42.315
So I chose not to kill him.

1:34:46.607 --> 1:34:48.857
The way of the sword is pitiless.

1:34:49.065 --> 1:34:51.565
Saintly virtues play no part in it.

1:34:52.732 --> 1:34:54.815
Your skills are matchless,

1:34:56.482 --> 1:34:59.774
but your mind is hostage to human sentiments.

1:38:35.107 --> 1:38:35.690
Look!

1:38:35.732 --> 1:38:38.399
The young woman kept her promise.

1:38:38.690 --> 1:38:41.065
She said she'd come back.

1:38:42.065 --> 1:38:43.399
She is trustworthy.

1:38:43.607 --> 1:38:46.190
She'll escort him into the land of Xinro.
