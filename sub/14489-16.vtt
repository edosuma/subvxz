the adults-only pancake house.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.402
Of course he's here
and not on another planet!

12:17.947 --> 12:21.242
In fact, he's about to
talk to you right now.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.868
LEELA: Oh, good.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.120
<i>Hello, it's me, Fry.</i>

12:25.204 --> 12:26.956
<i>I'm drunk right now.</i>

12:27.498 --> 12:28.958
<i>So just leave.</i>

12:29.041 --> 12:30.251
LEELA: (TENTATIVELY) Okay.

12:30.501 --> 12:31.835
I love you.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.337
<i>Olive you.</i>

12:34.630 --> 12:36.340
(LAUGHS)

12:37.174 --> 12:41.136
And finally, our new employee
of the month is Fry.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.931
He's really been putting
his nose to the grindstone,

12:44.014 --> 12:45.933
according to Bender's
constant updates.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.019
He's been working so hard,
we barely even see him.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.938
It's strange, that.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.398
There's nothing
strange about it.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.818
He's just out of sight around
this corner, exterminating mice.

12:56.235 --> 12:57.236
(TAPE REWINDING)

12:57.361 --> 12:58.862
<i>Mice... Mice...</i>

12:59.196 --> 13:01.282
<i>Myself... Elf... Elf...</i>

13:01.365 --> 13:02.366
Oops.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.867
Elves are back.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.208
T. text home?

13:11.292 --> 13:12.376
Sorry, DOY-

13:12.543 --> 13:15.671
'Cause of the embargo, our planets
aren't allowed to communicate.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.715
Update Facebook status home?

13:17.881 --> 13:19.049
(SIGHS)

13:19.550 --> 13:23.053
Look, my scout manual has a seotion
on emergenoy communication.

13:23.429 --> 13:24.972
Maybe we can
rig something up.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.266
Would you like that, boy?
Would you, boy?

13:27.349 --> 13:28.392
(PANTING)

13:35.232 --> 13:36.775
Watch out!

13:40.237 --> 13:42.781
Sorry. This planet
has a moon problem.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.163
So what makes
this thing fly?

13:49.246 --> 13:51.040
It's powered by love.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.541
Aw...

13:53.083 --> 13:55.377
Okay, stop loving me
so much so we can land.

13:55.461 --> 13:56.462
No problem.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.385
Okay, this tech dump

14:03.469 --> 14:06.347
has every kind of high-tech
communications device.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.767
Using all of them, I'm sure
I can get a message home.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.019
(GRUNTS)

14:12.186 --> 14:13.520
There. Finished.

14:20.611 --> 14:23.781
Oh, God, I can't believe
I abandoned Fry.

14:24.031 --> 14:28.619
I'll never forget the feel of his
soft skin against my flailing fists.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.788
(SOBS)

14:34.041 --> 14:36.168
Wait, there's still
some beer left.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.922
Huh?

14:46.387 --> 14:47.388
(GASPS)

14:47.471 --> 14:50.432
"S.O.S."? Those are
the letters that Fry knows!

14:50.641 --> 14:51.975
He's alive!

14:53.811 --> 14:55.104
Yeah?

15:00.484 --> 15:03.529
LRRR: Jrrr, how do I watch
a funny on the YouTube?

15:03.821 --> 15:06.156
It's my dad. Quick, hide!

15:06.281 --> 15:07.324
(GRUNTS)

15:10.536 --> 15:11.745
What's going on in here?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.372
Nothing.

15:13.497 --> 15:16.083
I was just playing foosball.
By myself.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.043
I thought I told you
to kill those foos.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.253
(RUSTLING IN CLOSET)

15:19.545 --> 15:20.587
LRRR: Hmm...

15:20.671 --> 15:24.341
Let's just have a look
in the toy closet, shall we?

15:25.968 --> 15:29.721
Skull, skull, skull,
skull, skull... Wait.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.640
Why haven't you
fleamed this skull?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.434
(SHUDDERS)
Hi, Mr. Lrrr.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.852
(SCREAMS)

15:36.520 --> 15:37.855
Hey, you're one of
those Earth spies

15:37.980 --> 15:39.314
from that Earth ship,
aren't you?

15:40.649 --> 15:41.775
Are you going to kill me?

15:41.859 --> 15:43.610
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.446
<i>Am 'vs.</i>

15:47.573 --> 15:49.992
BENDER: Three, two, one.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.876
Hang on Fry,
I'm a-comin' to save you!

16:00.043 --> 16:02.254
<i>You are my hero.</i>

16:02.337 --> 16:03.964
Shut up, Fry, I know it.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.721
It's a nice day.

16:10.888 --> 16:13.223
We'll take him out to the yard,
and after you shoot him,

16:13.307 --> 16:14.850
we'll play catch
with his bladder.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.227
But I can't.
He's my pet.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.604
You shot your hamster.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.814
I told you,
that was suicide.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.065
(FRY GROANS)

16:23.150 --> 16:25.611
He looks kind of sick. What
have you been feeding him?

16:25.694 --> 16:27.738
Uh, some stuff I made.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.824
Whatever. It's time I
made a man out of you.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.077
Right here, today, while I'm not
missing anything good on TV.

16:34.203 --> 16:36.914
Now get in there
and shoot your beloved pet!

16:40.751 --> 16:42.419
I guess this is goodbye.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.672
It's okay, Jrrr.

16:45.756 --> 16:49.259
The week I spent hiding in your
closet, eating your turds,

16:49.343 --> 16:51.261
was the best week
of my life.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.603
(FRY SHRIEKS)

17:03.732 --> 17:05.233
Run, boy! Run!

17:12.991 --> 17:16.494
He's escaping on
a bicycle powered by love.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.205
Which is an ordinary
thing on this planet.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.421
(ALL PANTING)

17:27.130 --> 17:29.049
They're getting away.
Love harder!

17:29.132 --> 17:31.552
We can't, sir. The men
have been hurt too often.

17:31.635 --> 17:32.761
Ahh!

17:32.844 --> 17:33.929
Ahh!

17:36.807 --> 17:39.142
We did it!
We're home free!

17:39.518 --> 17:41.103
Yes, but...

17:41.228 --> 17:42.354
I'm dying.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.022
Not 'cause of the turds.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.232
Can I have a turd?

17:45.482 --> 17:47.901
Just rest.
I'm gonna get you to a vet.

17:53.407 --> 17:54.700
(GRUNTING)

17:56.952 --> 18:00.205
I am Drrr, doctor of the
planet Omicron Persei 8.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.874
It appears you may have
ingested something toxic.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.210
Open your mouth
and say "ahhhh!"

18:05.419 --> 18:06.587
Ahhh.

18:06.712 --> 18:07.754
Good God!

18:07.838 --> 18:10.382
Here, take some of this herb
to ease the pain.

18:11.842 --> 18:12.926
Can you save him?

18:13.093 --> 18:15.971
I could, but he'd only live
another 80 years at most.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.056
The humane thing is
to put him to sleep.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.850
(EXCLAIMS)

18:20.392 --> 18:22.019
Stop!
I won't let you do it!

18:23.604 --> 18:24.605
Dad?

18:24.688 --> 18:26.356
Because you have to do it.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.651
Be a man for once and fleam
this wretched creature.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.236
I won't.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.947
I'm not exactly
like you, okay?

18:34.031 --> 18:36.491
I don't want to conquer
planets or kill things,

18:36.658 --> 18:38.076
or wear a lame cape.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.828
It's not lame,
it's lamé.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.247
And this thing
lying on the bed?

18:42.456 --> 18:46.710
He may be a weird skin ball full of
love and some kind of red juice,

18:46.793 --> 18:48.045
which is delicious,
by the way,

18:48.170 --> 18:49.421
I've been drinking it
every day,

18:49.546 --> 18:50.589
but we're friends.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.924
And <i>lWill</i> not kill him.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.517
You know, standing up
to rne is pretty manly.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.437
I'll tell you what, sport.
I'll kill him for you.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.815
Good news! Nobody has
to kill him after all.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.442
Because he already died!

(BENDER GRUNTING)

19:38.428 --> 19:39.429
Fry?

19:40.097 --> 19:43.308
Bender. I knew you wouldn't abandon
rne for much more than a week.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.228
What's happening?
Why is his butt glowing?

19:46.311 --> 19:48.855
The electromagnetic intensity
of the robot's friendship

19:48.939 --> 19:52.359
is causing the herbs in his
bowels to bioluminesce with love.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.403
Probably.
That's right, ugly.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.405
I'm here to take
my friend home.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.448
Whoa, is that a fleam?

19:59.157 --> 20:01.410
But, T.,
can't you stay with me?

20:01.493 --> 20:03.078
We could grow up together.

20:03.161 --> 20:06.123
No. I need to grow up
on my own planet.

20:06.456 --> 20:10.252
I must bid you farewell,
my special friend.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.973
What the hell's been
going on around here?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.103
Ah! Fry!

20:28.186 --> 20:30.814
You've been working so hard,
we haven't seen you in days.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.067
Wait, what?
No, I was stuck on... Ow!

20:34.151 --> 20:37.863
Stuck on another delivery
that he undertook on his own.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.199
We're all very lucky and not
suspicious to have him.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.120
Hey, Fry, things sure have
been going great between us.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.039
Remember that make-out
session in that dark closet?

20:48.165 --> 20:50.292
You were like a machine.

20:50.792 --> 20:51.918
But I...

20:52.002 --> 20:53.503
<i>Olive you.</i>

20:54.963 --> 20:56.339
<i>It's me, Fry!</i>

20:56.506 --> 20:58.258
It sure is.
