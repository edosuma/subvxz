WEBVTT

00:15.932 --> 00:17.809
Okay, so you'll just be sitting here,

00:17.892 --> 00:19.686
and you'll look directly into the lens.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.522
We'll just have a conversation.
You can tell your side of the story.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.732
Whatever you want.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.442
If you feel uncomfortable at any point,

00:25.525 --> 00:27.902
-you know, feel free to stop and--
-Alright.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.279
-All good?
-Yes.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.948
-[man] Kevin, are you all set?
-Mm-hm.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.701
[man] Please state your name
and why I'm interviewing you.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.954
My name is Kevin McClain.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.208
St. Bernardine High School will tell you
that I am the Turd Burglar.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.127
They will tell you how I confessed

00:44.210 --> 00:46.546
and that it is an open-and-shut case.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.174
But what they won't tell you

00:49.257 --> 00:51.384
is that they forced that confession.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.970
And they surely will not tell you

00:54.054 --> 00:56.723
that the excrement came also
at my expense,

00:56.806 --> 00:58.266
because I, Kevin McClain,

00:58.892 --> 00:59.809
also...

01:00.769 --> 01:01.895
shit my pants.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.899
Shat? Shit? Shat my pants?

01:05.982 --> 01:06.983
Shit. It's shit.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.487
One more...
[coughs]

01:10.570 --> 01:11.404
...time?

01:14.407 --> 01:16.534
My name is Kevin McClain.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.512
[Peter]
Kevin McClain was expelled from school,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.973
[Peter]
indicted by the Bellevue Police,

02:20.223 --> 02:23.309
[Peter] and placed on house arrest
for crimes that he confessed to.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.981
[Peter] He now claims that
those confessions were coerced.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.984
[Peter] But why would anyone confess
to crimes...

02:31.359 --> 02:32.819
[Peter] that they didn't commit?

02:33.361 --> 02:37.657
[James] We know as a certainty
that false confessions do happen,

02:37.740 --> 02:40.535
even in high-stakes crime,
I mean, death penalty crimes.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.829
And you have to start with that reality,

02:42.912 --> 02:46.708
that people who are not crazy,
people who are not starved for attention,

02:46.791 --> 02:50.170
you know, reasonably normal people,
can be led to a false confession.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.173
And once you start with that,
I think, undeniable fact,

02:53.256 --> 02:55.550
it makes it much easier
to start thinking through

02:55.717 --> 02:58.386
whether or not a particular confession
that you're looking at

02:58.469 --> 03:00.054
might be one of the false ones.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.224
When I was called out of class
to speak with the officers,

03:03.308 --> 03:05.935
I figured I was simply
a name on a checklist.

03:06.019 --> 03:06.853
Have a seat.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.938
[Kevin]
But my time spent with the officers

03:09.022 --> 03:10.690
[Kevin] was not an interrogation.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.817
[Kevin] It was theater.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.154
They were looking to take someone down.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.949
And I was the proverbial...

03:21.367 --> 03:22.285
guy.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.955
Forty innocent kids pooped in their pants.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.666
Okay? You think poop is funny?

03:28.958 --> 03:31.794
There was definitely good cop/bad cop.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.339
Seeing your classmates crap their pants?

03:34.839 --> 03:36.674
That's funny.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.717
I'd laugh at that.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.219
[James Milbank]
Whether it's good cop or bad cop,

03:39.552 --> 03:42.555
interrogating somebody
is pretty much opportunistic.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.933
You try a bunch of different things,
looking for the lever

03:45.016 --> 03:46.768
that's going to get you
where you want to go.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.020
You went out of your way
to knock that lemonade

03:49.103 --> 03:51.314
out of Brother Buckley's hand,
didn't you?

03:53.024 --> 03:55.360
[Kevin]
The reason I went out of my way

03:55.443 --> 03:58.571
was to talk to Jacob Linder
about an AP Bio assignment.

03:59.989 --> 04:03.284
And, I don't know, I suppose
my mind must have already drifted

04:03.368 --> 04:05.036
to cell transformations,

04:05.119 --> 04:05.995
[Kevin] because...

04:06.746 --> 04:09.332
[Kevin] I bumped into Brother Buckley.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.334
[male police officer]
Why not replace a lemonade

04:11.417 --> 04:12.293
[male police officer] with a lemonade?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.296
Why would you replace a lemonade
with a horchata?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.090
[Kevin] But the horchata...

04:18.591 --> 04:21.469
is only suspicious to anyone
with an unsophisticated palate.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.305
Now, this is what I'm very excited about.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.016
It's called panda dung tea.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.644
[woman]
Kevin's really weird with beverages.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.437
Damn it.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.856
[woman] So, the horchata thing
doesn't surprise me at all.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.774
Shoot.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.568
Our cafeteria splurges
on Sri Lankan cinnamon.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.779
It is shockingly smooth and sweet,

04:39.862 --> 04:43.283
and when mixed with organic whole milk,
as the Spaniards intended it,

04:44.409 --> 04:45.410
it's divine.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.704
And, yes, it is $1.25 more,

04:48.121 --> 04:49.872
and I think that's a fair markup.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.667
[Kevin] I felt...

04:53.793 --> 04:56.546
[Kevin] terrible about bumping
into Brother Buckley,

04:56.629 --> 04:58.756
[Kevin] so I bought him
the superior beverage.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.302
[loud beeping]

05:02.427 --> 05:03.678
Don't mind the bell.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.722
You're on our schedule.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.058
[Kevin] But school's over.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.978
[female police officer]
School is over, but not for you.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.189
[Kevin] But my grandmother
will be waiting--

05:15.273 --> 05:17.692
[woman] We spoke to your grandmother.
You're gonna take the later bus.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.031
[woman]
They made it sound like he was...

05:23.531 --> 05:25.366
[woman]
helping their investigation.

05:26.242 --> 05:29.037
I asked them if I should leave work
and go down to the school,

05:29.120 --> 05:31.372
and they said,
"Oh, it's not necessary."

05:32.332 --> 05:36.002
I didn't know that they were
considering him a suspect.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.548
And they kept him in
that room for hours...

05:41.132 --> 05:42.633
with no tea.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.971
Cops are allowed to do this
for two hours, four hours, six hours,

05:47.722 --> 05:49.891
in part 'cause they're trying
different things,

05:49.974 --> 05:52.935
but also because they're trying
to just wear down the suspect.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.606
It had been hours
of relentless interrogation.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.650
[Kevin]
I didn't know if it was ever going to end.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.319
[male police officer]
Kevin, here's the thing.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.029
We know you did it.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.364
How?

06:04.906 --> 06:07.283
Because your best friend told us.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.162
And who might that be?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.205
Tanner Bassett.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.418
In the moment,
it was very hard to believe.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.966
Not so hard to believe now.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.096
[woman] Knowing it was Tanner
that went to the cops...

06:30.264 --> 06:32.600
I just can't imagine
how that made Kevin feel.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.771
I'm just trying to figure out,

06:36.854 --> 06:38.898
like, so when you got over
into the parking lot--

06:38.981 --> 06:40.566
-Excuse me, officers.
-Hey, Kathy.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.193
Can Kevin take a little break?

06:42.276 --> 06:44.153
We're making so much progress.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.071
30 minutes.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.240
Okay.

06:47.990 --> 06:48.991
Come on, Kevin.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.914
[Peter] At 5:15 p.m.,

06:55.540 --> 06:59.252
[Peter] Kathy Wexler, the school's
Dean of Students since 2003,

06:59.752 --> 07:01.337
[Peter] comes to give Kevin a break.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.464
[Peter] When he returns,

07:04.132 --> 07:05.466
[Peter] over 50 minutes later,

07:06.342 --> 07:08.386
[Peter]
Kevin's story changes significantly.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.725
Are you ready to cooperate?

07:17.019 --> 07:17.854
Yes.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.439
You ready to...

07:20.106 --> 07:21.441
confess what you've done?

07:21.941 --> 07:22.775
Yes.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.821
[Peter] What was said between Kevin
and Mrs. Wexler in those 50 minutes?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.658
[Peter] How do you go from maintaining
your innocence for six hours...

07:31.117 --> 07:32.160
[Peter] to confessing?

07:32.493 --> 07:35.288
Certainly, one of the maneuvers
that gets used a lot

07:35.371 --> 07:38.708
is getting the person to think about...

07:39.709 --> 07:42.378
possible punishments,
possible rewards.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.339
I mean, if you're talking about
a police officer,

07:45.423 --> 07:48.676
they are not allowed to say,
"If you confess, this will happen.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.803
If you don't confess, this will happen."

07:50.887 --> 07:53.139
I mean, they cannot do that out loud.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.516
[Peter]
But what if somebody from the school

07:55.600 --> 07:57.685
[Peter]
made him a promise behind closed doors?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.273
[Kevin]
She allowed me to stretch my limbs...

08:03.733 --> 08:05.067
[Kevin] and stop by my locker.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.654
[Kevin]
I was able to withdraw my tea chest.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.576
[Kevin] And then she took me
to the teachers' lounge.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.245
[Kevin] I had never before seen a student

08:16.329 --> 08:18.456
[Kevin]
permitted in the private faculty quarters.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.418
[Kevin] She knew I'd missed lunch, so...

08:23.544 --> 08:25.296
[Kevin]
she heated me some mozzarella sticks.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.466
[Kevin] I know it sounds silly, but...

08:29.926 --> 08:32.803
those were the best mozzarella sticks
I've had in my life.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.976
She knew exactly how to get to him,

08:39.268 --> 08:40.645
how to manipulate him.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.146
Give him tea

08:42.230 --> 08:44.273
and give him mozzarella sticks.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.692
[Kevin] I told her I was innocent.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.110
[Kevin] I was...

08:48.986 --> 08:49.946
terrified.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.158
I thought I could potentially...

08:54.742 --> 08:58.329
be arrested for a crime
I didn't commit.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.874
Mrs. Wexler...

09:02.833 --> 09:03.960
promised me...

09:04.627 --> 09:06.045
she wouldn't let that happen.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.507
[Kevin] She told me that if I cooperated
with the officers

09:09.590 --> 09:11.551
[Kevin] and told them everything
they wanted to hear,

09:11.634 --> 09:13.719
[Kevin]
that she could personally guarantee...

09:14.053 --> 09:15.846
[Kevin]
the school would not press charges.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.140
[Kevin] She said that they would treat it
as a prank

09:18.224 --> 09:20.142
[Kevin] and it would be
a two-week suspension.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.812
It wouldn't even go
on my permanent record.

09:23.145 --> 09:27.066
I mean, a two-week suspension
versus expulsion and legal action?

09:27.942 --> 09:30.486
Mrs. Wexler made it seem
like a total no-brainer.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.029
Even then,

09:32.321 --> 09:33.447
I told her no.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.576
I told her that I was innocent,

09:36.659 --> 09:39.954
and I was sure that with the aid
of a lawyer in a court of law,

09:40.037 --> 09:41.247
I would be exonerated.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.334
[Kevin] That's when she told me
that the officers were proceeding

09:45.418 --> 09:49.338
[Kevin] as if they had all of the evidence
they needed to convict,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.382
[Kevin] and that even with a great lawyer,

09:51.465 --> 09:53.467
[Kevin]
that my grandmother couldn't afford,

09:53.843 --> 09:56.387
[Kevin] I still might be convicted
and thrown in jail.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.431
And I understand...

09:58.931 --> 10:01.183
the prison-industrial complex.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.061
I thought that confessing
was my only way out

10:04.145 --> 10:07.398
because that's what Mrs. Wexler told me
was the case.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.027
[Kevin]
She told me that she could help me.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.945
[Kevin] And I believed her.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.995
[Peter] An email from Mrs. Wexler
on December 10th, 2017.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.581
[Peter] "Dear Mr. Maldonado,

10:23.831 --> 10:25.416
[Peter] I appreciate you reaching out,

10:25.833 --> 10:27.918
[Peter] but the issues in question
have been resolved

10:28.002 --> 10:30.880
[Peter] because of
Mr. McClain's own words and confession.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.507
[Peter] I could never promise a student

10:33.591 --> 10:36.052
[Peter] a reduced punishment
for crimes of this nature.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.888
[Peter]
This took place a few weeks ago,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.015
[Peter]
but to the best of my knowledge,

10:41.098 --> 10:42.808
[Peter]
we spoke only of how he was feeling

10:42.892 --> 10:45.811
[Peter] and how he wanted the guilt
off his shoulders."

10:47.355 --> 10:50.983
[Peter] Kevin McClain confessed to
being the Turd Burglar on November 21st,

10:51.901 --> 10:53.694
[Peter]
fifteen days after the Brownout.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.571
Police are turning their attention to...

10:55.655 --> 10:57.865
[Peter]
That's 15 days of news coverage.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.202
[Peter] Fifteen days of pressure
from parents and alumni

11:01.285 --> 11:03.412
[Peter]
threatening to pull their donations.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.998
[Peter] Fifteen days of angry emails
and phone calls

11:06.082 --> 11:08.042
[Peter] all directed at one person,

11:08.626 --> 11:10.127
[Peter] the Dean of Students,

11:10.419 --> 11:11.462
[Peter] Mrs. Wexler.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.465
[ Kevin] I was so naive.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.759
How could I be so blind?

11:17.259 --> 11:20.096
She was working with the officers.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.306
It was just another ploy.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.933
All part of the show.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.437
[Peter] The Turd Burglar was a problem
that needed to be solved.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.565
[Peter]
Did Mrs. Wexler find her solution

11:32.441 --> 11:33.693
[Peter] in Kevin McClain?

11:34.568 --> 11:36.445
[female police officer]
You did all three crimes?

11:38.322 --> 11:39.198
Yes.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.368
Okay.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.829
Let's talk about the piñata.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.967
Show us how you got
the poop in there, bud.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.889
[boy] I was in Ms. Montgomery's class.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.683
It was Vonnegut's Birthday.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.686
Kurt Vonnegut was apparently
this famous author.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.564
[Angela]
I like to think of Kurt Vonnegut as

12:11.647 --> 12:15.067
the Kanye West of satirical
postmodern literature.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.570
Ms. Montgomery is, like,
obsessed with him.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.408
Vonnegut's Birthday
is such a special, fun day.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.993
The students love it.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.078
It's everyone's favorite day in English,

12:26.162 --> 12:27.747
'cause we don't do shit.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.041
This is my third year in a row of doing it
and it gets better every year.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.002
[Angela] I decorated the whole classroom

12:33.085 --> 12:35.504
[Angela] with Breakfast of Champions cake,

12:35.963 --> 12:37.798
[Angela] Slaughterhouse-Five streamers,

12:37.882 --> 12:39.300
[Angela] and a Vonnegut piñata.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.594
[woman]
She pays for all this shit herself.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.972
[woman] She has a cake and a piñata
every period.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.225
[man]
I got to hit the piñata first.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.102
Lucky me.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.442
[man]
I was dizzy around the second spin,

12:56.525 --> 12:58.694
[man]
but I kind of got my balance back.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.489
[man]
I swang the first time, they cheered.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.866
[cheering, applause]

13:06.160 --> 13:07.495
[man] Second time, they cheered.

13:08.746 --> 13:09.705
[man] Third time...

13:10.331 --> 13:11.290
[man] they screamed.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.590
[man] At first,
I thought it was for the candy.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.675
But then I realized...

13:22.426 --> 13:24.345
no one screams like that for candy.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.096
Yeah!

13:26.180 --> 13:27.223
Oh...

13:27.890 --> 13:30.434
[screaming]

13:33.062 --> 13:34.605
I took off the blindfold and...

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
there it was.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.233
Eww!

13:37.358 --> 13:38.442
Gross!

13:38.526 --> 13:40.027
[coughing, retching]

13:41.612 --> 13:43.405
Show us how you got
the poop in there, bud.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.545
-Okay.
-No, no, no.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.879
-Damn it.
-I think-- Can you...?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.631
Let's try that again.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.466
Let's just-- Give it to me, here.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.677
Why don't-- I'm gonna just--

14:04.760 --> 14:06.053
Look at it this way.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.388
Here.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.515
If I were putting poop in there,

14:09.598 --> 14:11.642
which is what you did,
where would it...?

14:12.643 --> 14:14.895
[Kevin's grandmother]
They were steering him.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.522
If you look at the tape,

14:17.064 --> 14:17.940
you can see,

14:18.023 --> 14:21.819
they gave him all the the ways
the crimes were done.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.904
[Kevin's grandmother]
He didn't know how the poop

14:23.988 --> 14:25.447
[Kevin's grandmother]
got into the Vonnegut Piñata,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.616
[Kevin's grandmother]
but they still made him write a confession

14:27.700 --> 14:30.202
[Kevin's grandmother] of how
he  put the poop in Vonnegut's shoulder.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.081
[David Milbank] The police will often
supply the suspect with details

14:34.164 --> 14:37.334
that supposedly only the guilty party
would know,

14:37.418 --> 14:40.379
and then later on, the police will say,

14:40.462 --> 14:43.632
"Look, how else could he have known this
unless he was guilty?"

14:43.716 --> 14:45.676
And, of course,
they brush past the fact

14:45.759 --> 14:49.221
that the suspect knew those details
because the cops supplied them.

14:49.346 --> 14:53.267
And you left your Turd Burglar card where?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.355
On Ms. Montgomery's desk.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.942
You left your Turd Burglar card...?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.072
In the piñata.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.407
Thank you.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.077
The officers told me all about
how I did it,

15:12.161 --> 15:13.537
but worse than that,

15:14.496 --> 15:15.414
they told me why.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.791
Because you hated everyone in the school.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.754
[Kevin] They invented an alternate reality

15:21.837 --> 15:25.549
where I did all this to get back
at my classmates,

15:26.008 --> 15:27.384
as some sort of revenge.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.304
Kids have been calling you that
since sixth grade?

15:30.387 --> 15:32.139
Right? "Shit Stain McClain!"

15:32.306 --> 15:34.558
"Hey! Shit Stain McClain!"

15:34.642 --> 15:38.520
Other than the Throwback Thursday
days before the Brownout,

15:38.604 --> 15:43.067
I had not heard "Shit Stain McClain"
in years.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.277
No, it makes no sense to me

15:45.361 --> 15:48.489
that he would take revenge
upon his classmates.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.867
I have never heard him complain
about his classmates.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.411
[Kevin's grandmother]
He'll complain about the food I make,

15:54.578 --> 15:56.830
[Kevin's grandmother]
or the fact that I make him go to church,

15:57.206 --> 15:59.458
or he doesn't care for me

15:59.541 --> 16:01.961
or my life choices,

16:02.252 --> 16:05.464
but he never once complained
about his classmates.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.133
You stick to yourself.
It's safer that way, isn't it?

16:09.343 --> 16:12.221
Less people making fun of you,
less people taking videos of you.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.432
They pointed to the Fruit Ninja videos
as evidence that I was bullied.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.227
[Kevin]
But look at the first Fruit Ninja video.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.563
Fruit Ninja!

16:21.647 --> 16:22.773
Fruit Ninja!

16:22.856 --> 16:25.359
[Kevin] I started it freshman year
with my friend Grayson.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.445
It was my idea.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.114
Don't you find that annoying?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.533
That the kids throw fruit at you?

16:32.616 --> 16:33.826
Absolutely not.

16:33.909 --> 16:34.827
-No?
-No.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.578
-No?
-No, I enjoy it.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.124
The idea that I should care
what a bunch of kids at my school

16:40.207 --> 16:41.500
think about me...

16:42.334 --> 16:43.794
It's preposterous.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.297
[Kevin] Bullying requires
an unwilling participant.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.924
Two-fruit combo.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.801
[Kevin] Do I seem unwilling?

16:51.218 --> 16:54.263
Maybe one or two of the videos,
out of context,

16:54.346 --> 16:56.598
might appear to be bullying.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.894
I can't... You can't throw
a watermelon at me.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.980
But in general, I love being
the Fruit Ninja,

17:03.063 --> 17:05.858
I love making the videos. It's fun.
It's a creative outlet.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.569
[Kevin] I'm friends with the people
who I make them with.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.989
[Molly] He doesn't think
he's being bullied,

17:12.364 --> 17:14.491
he thinks he's pretty cool.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.451
Kevin's weird,

17:15.534 --> 17:18.620
but he's not, like, on the spectrum
or anything.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.414
[man] He's just weird on purpose.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.624
[man] Kevin likes the attention.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.168
That's why he acts the way he does.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.377
Hey, Fruit Ninja!

17:27.296 --> 17:28.839
[woman]
Kevin and I are on different schedules,

17:28.922 --> 17:31.258
[woman] but we still pass by each other
every day in the hall.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.969
And, yeah, kids toss fruit at him,

17:34.845 --> 17:37.765
but he doesn't see it as being bullied.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.186
Boy, that was quick!

17:42.269 --> 17:44.563
That's Fruit Ninja right there.
He real wit' it.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.274
I wouldn't say that Kevin's bullied,

17:47.483 --> 17:48.567
I'd say that he's...

17:49.610 --> 17:51.487
found a creative way
to make a name for himself.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.822
Like fuckin' Fruit Ninja.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.240
It's fuckin' awesome.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.661
They also pointed to Alex Wright
dressing as me for Halloween.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.456
Look at the photo.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.125
[Kevin] That's my flat cap,

18:05.209 --> 18:06.835
[Kevin] that's my jacket,

18:06.919 --> 18:08.212
[Kevin] that's my vest.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.630
[Kevin] I lent them to him.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.298
[Kevin] He wasn't making fun of me.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.802
Or at least no more than a friend
makes fun of another friend.

18:14.885 --> 18:15.761
It was funny.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.180
It's not like I'm Diapey Drew Pankratz.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.183
[Kevin]
The cops needed to hear a motivation,

18:21.809 --> 18:23.018
[Kevin] so they invented it.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.562
Kevin, you are on a roll right now.

18:28.023 --> 18:28.857
What...

18:30.609 --> 18:31.944
What'd you do next, bud?

18:33.278 --> 18:34.196
The Shit Launcher.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.572
The Shit Launcher.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.035
You mean this?

18:45.332 --> 18:48.710
So there was a pep rally
before the big game against Grayling

18:48.794 --> 18:51.547
on November 14th
and the days leading up to it.

18:51.630 --> 18:55.175
The Turd Burglar was warning
about a third crime on that day.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.095
[woman] The Turd Burglar mentions
committing another crime,

18:58.345 --> 19:01.473
[woman] and now we're having a pep rally
for a basketball team that's undefeated.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.559
Why are we even here?
It makes no sense.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.811
Your starting point guard,

19:06.353 --> 19:08.063
Lou Carter!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.482
[cheering]

19:11.525 --> 19:13.777
[woman]
We all saw the Turd Burglar's warning,

19:13.861 --> 19:14.820
but the gym felt safe.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.280
There's no food or drink allowed.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.824
[woman] I mean, you could even
get a detention for chewing gum.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.119
[man] Security was tight.
They checked everyone's bag.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.704
Last but not least,

19:23.829 --> 19:25.080
DeMarcus Tillman.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.790
[cheering]

19:29.626 --> 19:32.129
[man] The gym is like the school's chapel,

19:32.212 --> 19:34.464
and this school has an actual chapel.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.009
[man] It didn't seem like anything bad
could happen in there.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.803
[man] So, look, this is what we gon' do.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.889
We gon' take it down
and we gon' turn it up.

19:41.972 --> 19:42.806
Y'all ready?

19:48.103 --> 19:49.271
[cheering]

19:51.982 --> 19:53.108
What is this?

19:53.525 --> 19:54.693
It smells like shit!

19:54.776 --> 19:56.486
[screaming]

19:56.862 --> 19:58.947
God, it's fucking disgusting!

20:00.866 --> 20:02.075
This is awful!

20:13.545 --> 20:15.547
[man] When the T-shirt cannon launched,

20:15.631 --> 20:17.758
[man] it was just dust all over the crowd.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.010
[man] It wasn't clear that it was poop...

20:20.677 --> 20:22.512
until someone shouted,
"It's poop!"

20:22.888 --> 20:23.972
And then everyone knew.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.557
We didn't know what it was
at the time,

20:25.641 --> 20:27.351
but later we found out
that it was cat shit.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.481
[woman] This poop was not wet and gooey.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.859
This was more of a poop...
dusting.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.987
[woman] You know, it was dried up

20:39.071 --> 20:40.113
[woman] and just,

20:40.364 --> 20:42.115
you know, broke into particles.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.161
[man] Yeah, I caught it.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.080
I mean, talk about limited edition.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.290
There's only, what, three ever made?

20:53.543 --> 20:54.878
Show us how you loaded the shit.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.713
I mean, you like to...

20:57.339 --> 20:59.299
put a lot of poop in a lot of kids' faces.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.510
-God dammit. No, Kevin.
-No.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.263
Don't play games right now, okay?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.473
No, it's not human shit,

21:06.556 --> 21:08.976
and you know that it's not human shit.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.352
So I just want to know...

21:12.020 --> 21:12.980
what shit?

21:13.689 --> 21:14.648
Dog.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.317
Dog? Is that your final answer?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.613
Want to poll the audience on this one?

21:21.697 --> 21:22.572
Cat.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.658
Well, that was quick.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.577
You could see that
he didn't even know

21:27.661 --> 21:29.579
what kind of poop was in the launcher.

21:30.205 --> 21:33.125
[Kevin's grandmother] He didn't know
how to get a T-shirt into the cannon.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.211
[Kevin's grandmother]
He was folding it like a crepe.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.007
Really, he should have rolled it
like a burrito.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.051
[woman] He confessed to each crime,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.137
[woman]
but he didn't know any of the details.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.973
Like, the cops definitely fed
all the lines to him.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.475
[woman]
How is that a legal confession of guilt?

21:52.519 --> 21:53.937
[man] It's just how it's done.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.439
[man] It's a pig pile.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.066
[man] You know, you stack on the facts
until the truth climbs out.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.195
[interviewer] So, you're confident
that Kevin McClain is the Turd Burglar?

22:03.238 --> 22:05.073
Yes, we had a confession.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.036
[interviewer]
But, I mean, no hard evidence.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.831
His best friend Tanner Bassett

22:12.914 --> 22:15.125
was with him when he bought
the laxatives.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.879
Kevin, the night before the Brownout,

22:19.421 --> 22:22.382
you went to Dawsey's Health Mart
with your best buddy Tanner Bassett.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.383
Is that right?

22:23.633 --> 22:24.468
Yeah.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.094
And you bought stuff.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.929
What was in the bag?

22:29.222 --> 22:30.766
Was it laxatives?

22:35.020 --> 22:35.854
Yes.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.522
[Kevin] I lied to the officers.

22:38.106 --> 22:42.194
I did go to Dawsey's with Tanner,
but I did not buy laxatives.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.237
[interviewer] Well, what did you buy?

22:45.238 --> 22:46.656
[Kevin] I do not remember.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.701
[Kevin] It was two weeks after the fact
when they asked me.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.914
[Kevin] Do you remember what you got at
a convenience store two weeks ago?

22:55.082 --> 22:55.916
[Kevin] I don't know.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.377
I wish I could remember, I really do,

22:58.460 --> 23:01.129
but all I know is that
it wasn't laxatives.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.425
[Peter] We know from the police report
that the key ingredient

23:05.509 --> 23:07.803
that caused the Brownout was maltitol.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.014
[Peter] So we decided to go
to Dawsey's ourselves

23:11.098 --> 23:12.808
[Peter]
to see which laxatives contained it.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.770
Iron oxide yellow, isopropyl alcohol.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.439
Do any of these have maltitol?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.109
This one doesn't.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.237
Maybe we're just not looking
in the right place.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.780
Let's go ask a pharmacist.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.118
You're not going to find any laxatives
with maltitol in 'em.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.160
Why not?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.246
It's primarily a sugar substitute.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.916
Do you have anything here
that has maltitol in it?

23:37.999 --> 23:39.292
-Yep.
-No laxatives have maltitol.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.627
We've got some candy.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.337
Like, what kind of candy?

23:43.755 --> 23:45.507
This one has the maltitol in it.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.136
[Peter] We discovered that
the only product in Dawsey's

23:49.219 --> 23:50.303
[Peter] that contained maltitol

23:50.387 --> 23:51.972
[Peter] was a sugar-free Gummy Bear.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.391
[Peter] It was a product with a reputation

23:54.474 --> 23:56.101
consistent with that of the Brownout.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.395
Says one Amazon customer,

23:59.146 --> 24:01.273
"These Gummy Bears
made me shit like crazy.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.234
My anus felt like
it was funneling Niagara Falls

24:04.317 --> 24:05.569
through a coffee straw."

24:06.570 --> 24:09.197
[Peter] But the idea that Kevin
boiled down Gummy Bears

24:09.281 --> 24:11.450
[Peter] and poured them into
the lemonade dispenser

24:11.783 --> 24:12.909
[Peter] seemed unlikely.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.369
[Peter] Not to mention,

24:14.453 --> 24:16.621
[Peter] that it would have
completely changed the color

24:16.705 --> 24:18.415
[Peter] and consistency of the beverage.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.334
-So where did the maltitol come from?
-I don't know.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.378
I mean, obviously
not from Dawsey's,  I guess.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.173
Did the police even try and verify
what Tanner said?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.008
I mean, if we were able
to come here

24:28.091 --> 24:30.093
and see that none of the laxatives
have maltitol,

24:30.177 --> 24:31.678
and they weren't able to do that,

24:31.761 --> 24:33.930
which means they just went off
of everything that Tanner said

24:34.014 --> 24:35.390
-and took it as facts.
-Yeah.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.727
If he can get the maltitol from Dawsey's
then that changes everything.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.147
You're right.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.358
I'm almost positive that
he had laxatives

24:45.775 --> 24:47.194
in that Dawsey's bag.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.195
Okay.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.989
[Peter] Maltitol caused the Brownout.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.201
[Peter] But maltitol can't be purchased
at Dawsey's.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.953
[Peter]
So why would Tanner tell the officers

24:57.037 --> 24:59.247
[Peter]
that Kevin's bag contained laxatives?

25:00.207 --> 25:01.583
[Peter] Why would Tanner lie?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.293
[woman] I don't know the details,

25:03.376 --> 25:05.378
but I do know that Kevin and Tanner

25:05.462 --> 25:07.464
haven't been best friends
for, like, a minute.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.885
He thinks I ruined Skip Day.

25:14.846 --> 25:18.058
[Peter]
Skip Day is a St. Bernardine institution.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.938
[Peter] It's an annual planned event
where students pitch in for an Airbnb

25:23.021 --> 25:24.356
[Peter] and skip class to party,

25:24.648 --> 25:27.150
[Peter] many of whom participate
in a social activity

25:27.234 --> 25:29.528
[Peter]
called the Great American Challenge.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.571
It was kind of a shitshow,

25:31.655 --> 25:34.032
because half the party was doing
the Great American Challenge,

25:34.115 --> 25:36.076
which is four teams of six.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.953
It's a race to finish a case of beer...

25:38.578 --> 25:40.080
[cheering, whooping]

25:40.288 --> 25:41.373
[woman] a full pizza,

25:41.748 --> 25:42.999
[woman] a handle of vodka,

25:43.833 --> 25:44.960
[woman] a full JUULpod.

25:45.752 --> 25:46.962
The big finisher:

25:47.045 --> 25:48.880
five hundred-piece custom puzzle

25:48.964 --> 25:51.091
[man] of Andrew Lundgarden's mom.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.343
[chanting] Lundgarden's mom!

25:53.426 --> 25:55.220
The puzzle has to be last.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.430
And the pizza has to be sausage jalapeño.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.640
It's fucking impossible.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.102
[woman] Kevin and Tanner always made fun
of Skip Day.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.812
They called it "Skip Chromosome Day."

26:04.020 --> 26:06.815
So when Skip Day
rolled around this year...

26:08.108 --> 26:12.612
Kevin was really surprised to see
that Tanner was not in school.

26:14.072 --> 26:14.990
[chime]

26:17.492 --> 26:18.410
[chime]

26:19.744 --> 26:20.662
[chime]

26:22.372 --> 26:23.290
[chime]

26:26.459 --> 26:27.377
[chime]

26:29.337 --> 26:30.255
[chime]

26:31.047 --> 26:32.716
-[man] This is the best Skip Day yet!
-[man] Yeah, bro!

26:35.218 --> 26:36.970
[banging]

26:37.679 --> 26:38.930
Guys, shh!

26:40.098 --> 26:40.932
[banging]

26:41.016 --> 26:42.142
The cops are here!

26:43.351 --> 26:46.980
Tanner was convinced that I...

26:47.814 --> 26:49.107
called the authorities.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.859
You resent your classmates.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.319
Don't you, Kevin?

26:52.819 --> 26:55.614
Yeah, you even went as far
as to call the police

26:55.697 --> 26:57.949
to get a Skip Day party canceled,
didn't you?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.909
I did not call the police.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.663
But Tanner...

27:05.040 --> 27:06.374
refused to believe me.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.877
He drove to my house,

27:09.085 --> 27:11.254
so angry, yelling at me.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.799
He accused me of being jealous.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.635
I wasn't there,

27:16.718 --> 27:18.928
but Tanner told me
that things got really heated.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.390
He said that they'd never really
fought like that before.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.809
And then, I guess Kevin just lost it.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.355
Finally, I had no choice but...

27:31.107 --> 27:32.817
I had to kick him out of the band.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.736
[looped sample of horse neighing]

27:34.819 --> 27:38.281
[Kevin]
I got this kid Myles to replace Tanner.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.285
[Kevin]
He's a better fit for our audience.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.120
[man] I was at Kyle's bar mitzvah.

27:44.537 --> 27:47.374
[Myles]
I met Kevin at the ice cream buffet.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.501
And Kevin asked me,

27:49.584 --> 27:50.418
"Hey,

27:51.169 --> 27:52.545
you want to be in a band?"

27:52.921 --> 27:55.215
And I was like, "Yeah."

27:55.548 --> 27:56.466
So...

27:57.425 --> 27:58.593
Now I'm in a band.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.097
[Kevin] We're trying to get back into
the bar mitzvah scene,

28:02.180 --> 28:05.183
and Myles is a middle schooler,

28:05.266 --> 28:07.102
so he's very connected,

28:07.185 --> 28:08.395
knows lots of 13-year-olds.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.481
[Myles] I think people thought
it was weird for high schoolers

28:11.564 --> 28:13.400
[Myles] to go and play
middle school parties.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.904
So, when I'm with him,
it's, like, less weird

28:17.987 --> 28:20.657
because I am a middle schooler.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.451
[heavy bass]

28:23.576 --> 28:25.453
Is that enough bass for you, Myles?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.288
That's what I'm talkin' about!

28:28.206 --> 28:29.165
Oh, Myles.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.501
Tanner was pissed.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.044
Wouldn't you be?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.880
[woman] He and Tanner started that band.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.675
[woman] And to kick him out?

28:39.217 --> 28:41.386
[woman]
And to replace him with a 10-year-old?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.265
He can't even play an instrument.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.184
I think Tanner is bitter.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.604
Apparently bitter enough

28:51.688 --> 28:54.983
to accuse me falsely of a felony.

28:56.317 --> 28:58.528
There definitely are some holes
in his story.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.030
I mean, why would he go to the cops
and tell 'em that

29:01.114 --> 29:02.699
he saw Kevin with laxatives?

29:02.782 --> 29:05.326
And not just laxatives,
everything that he brought to the police -

29:05.410 --> 29:08.329
the horchata, the trip to Dawsey's,

29:08.413 --> 29:09.831
the fact that he'd been
acting weird.

29:09.914 --> 29:13.376
I mean, he had all this information
right after the Brownout.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.379
[Peter] The Brownout takes place
on November 6th,

29:16.796 --> 29:19.007
[Peter]
but Tanner doesn't go to the police.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.634
[Peter] November 10th, the Poop Piñata.

29:22.051 --> 29:24.471
[Peter]
November 14th, the Shit Launcher.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.265
[Peter]
But Tanner still doesn't go to the police.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.351
[Peter] Then three days later,
they fight about Skip Day.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.228
[Peter] And on the 19th,

29:32.312 --> 29:34.564
[Peter]
Kevin kicks Tanner out of the band.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.316
[Peter] The very next day,

29:36.483 --> 29:38.651
[Peter]
Tanner finally goes to the police.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.569
[Peter] Why?

29:39.944 --> 29:42.822
Because he got kicked out
of the band on November 19th.

29:42.906 --> 29:43.948
Think he was butthurt?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.283
Yes, he was butthurt.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.076
Is that our best theory?

29:47.160 --> 29:49.496
I mean, yeah, that makes sense to me.

29:49.579 --> 29:53.291
I think it's clear that Tanner
had an ax to grind.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.377
Everything that he brought to the police
comes with a huge grain of salt.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.506
I think that the police
ran with Tanner's statements,

29:59.589 --> 30:00.965
looped in Mrs. Wexler,

30:01.049 --> 30:02.592
and forced Kevin's confession.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.052
That theory adds up to me.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.637
So you think Kevin's innocent?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.722
Yeah. You don't?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.641
No, I just...

30:10.225 --> 30:11.810
I keep coming back to the horchata.

30:12.393 --> 30:15.188
I don't buy
his Sri Lankan cinnamon excuse.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.940
And this is just weird.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.150
Look at the Turd Burglar's Instagram,
right?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.318
Uh-huh?

30:20.401 --> 30:23.863
[Sam] Now, for every crime
he'd post a warning days before.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.324
-[Peter] Right.
-[Sam] And an aftermath post right after.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.244
Just to let the school know
that he was right under their noses

30:29.327 --> 30:31.579
the whole time before each
shit attack occurs.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.497
Right.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.874
Now, November 30th and December 4th,

30:34.958 --> 30:36.209
[Sam] we've got two warnings.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.253
[Sam] Nothing after that.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.089
[Sam] That was the last thing
the Turd Burglar ever posted.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.131
[Sam] Now, why?

30:42.257 --> 30:43.258
Think about that.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.886
I think it's because Kevin
was already expelled,

30:46.970 --> 30:48.638
under house arrest
with an ankle monitor.

30:48.721 --> 30:50.014
That makes sense to me.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.935
[Peter] It is odd that the Turd Burglar
warned of a fourth crime

30:54.018 --> 30:54.978
[Peter] that never occurred,

30:55.687 --> 30:58.815
[Peter] and did so after
Kevin was placed on house arrest.

30:59.607 --> 31:00.692
[Peter] Could Sam be right?

31:01.526 --> 31:03.278
[Peter]
Was this Kevin's desperate attempt

31:03.361 --> 31:06.114
[Peter] to make it seem like
the Turd Burglar was still at large?

31:06.322 --> 31:08.992
So you think that Kevin McClain
is the Turd Burglar?

31:09.075 --> 31:10.535
If we were placing bets...

31:11.828 --> 31:13.246
With no hard evidence?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.958
I actually think the most damning
piece of evidence against Kevin

31:17.041 --> 31:18.501
is the footage of the Brownout.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.380
Kevin was a victim of the Brownout.

31:22.922 --> 31:23.882
Was he?

31:27.844 --> 31:29.637
-When I see this footage, right?
-Yeah?

31:29.721 --> 31:30.805
I see a lot of kids...

31:32.015 --> 31:33.766
fighting to keep their shit in.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.643
-Clenching.
-Right.

31:36.519 --> 31:37.687
But when I see Kevin,

31:38.021 --> 31:40.398
[Sam] I see a lot of sweating,

31:41.107 --> 31:42.483
[Sam] laboring.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.069
What are you saying?

31:47.113 --> 31:49.032
I'm saying I think Kevin
squeezed one out.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.118
You think he shit his own pants
to look innocent?

31:52.869 --> 31:53.703
Yeah.

31:53.828 --> 31:54.662
Look,

31:54.787 --> 31:55.622
clenching...

31:57.206 --> 31:58.041
Right.

31:58.499 --> 31:59.542
Straining...

32:02.170 --> 32:03.004
Clenching...

32:03.171 --> 32:04.339
Clenching...

32:05.965 --> 32:07.425
It's like a scared look.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.511
-Straining.
-That's kind of a hard face.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.097
-I don't know.
-I just did it for you.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.517
[Sam] Look at his face and tell me
that's the face of an innocent man.

32:18.227 --> 32:20.396
[Peter] I couldn't dismiss anything
Sam was saying.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.858
[Peter] I couldn't tell you
that Kevin wasn't straining.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.028
[Peter] Forced confessions...

32:28.613 --> 32:29.572
[Peter] Forced turds.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.659
[Peter] It was a lot to digest.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.120
[Peter]
But fortunately, I did know one thing.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.124
[Peter] It wasn't straining that got me
interested in this case.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.501
[woman] Hi, Peter.

32:41.584 --> 32:42.710
[woman] My name is Chloe Lyman

32:42.794 --> 32:44.921
and I'm a junior
at St. Bernardine Catholic...

32:45.129 --> 32:47.882
[Peter] Chloe Lyman came to me
with a story of injustice.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.135
[Peter] Her version painted Kevin
as an innocent man.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.681
[Peter] But her version fell on deaf ears.

32:55.306 --> 32:58.685
[Peter] The school and police refused
to investigate her full statement.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.311
[Peter] But why?

33:00.728 --> 33:02.689
I know that Kevin isn't
the Turd Burglar,

33:03.231 --> 33:04.482
because I know who is.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.695
[Peter] Why would anyone
attempt to silence Chloe?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.572
[Peter] Why was she ignored?

33:12.448 --> 33:15.576
I was standing in line to get a soda
from the vending machine,

33:15.660 --> 33:17.453
and there was someone
in front of me.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.247
And when he got out his wallet to pay,

33:19.747 --> 33:21.749
I saw the Turd Burglar card in there,

33:21.833 --> 33:23.084
right in front of me.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.588
It was DeMarcus Tillman.
