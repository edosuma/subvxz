WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.156
MAX: I literally wrote the book
on the multiverse.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.725
Should I sign it? I mean,
he's clearly a fan, and...

00:24.758 --> 00:26.927
Can't bring food
in the building.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.829
This is a scare face.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.931
Everything's a joke for you.
Tell me what happened

00:30.964 --> 00:33.701
-with you and the LAPD!
-I got my partner killed!

00:33.734 --> 00:35.103
Oh, my God, that's my wife.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.638
-Do not look for me.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.046
*

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
*

01:38.031 --> 01:40.734
(Leroy
laughs)

01:40.768 --> 01:44.272
* I was battle-torn
and worn... *

01:44.305 --> 01:46.674
Board flip.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.310
* By scores of arrows...

01:49.343 --> 01:50.844
Oh, you did another one, huh?

01:50.878 --> 01:53.981
Yup. Got to say,
I'm a little jealous of Cagney.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.450
Not Lacey, 'cause she's got
those kids to deal with.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.287
But Cagney, she's all cop, man.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.156
-Pulls her gun out
at least twice a week.
-Leroy, listen.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.926
The Schwarzschild radius is

02:05.959 --> 02:09.330
the size that a given object
with a given mass...

02:09.363 --> 02:11.365
Okay.

02:11.399 --> 02:14.302
Yeah, I got a question.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.704
What happened
to all the paranormal crap?

02:16.737 --> 02:19.106
We used to have, like,
a monster a week.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.176
Now it's nothing
for three months? Nothing!

02:25.479 --> 02:28.849
You know what, Max?
You got to stop with this board.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.150
What are you doing?
-Needs to come down.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.019
-That board needs to come down.
-Leroy, I am close.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.387
-You're too close.
-I... Well...

02:33.421 --> 02:34.822
She left you
a hundred years ago.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.290
All right, you got to move on.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.591
I have moved on.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.730
I have moved on.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.198
And that's why
the board's coming down.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.499
LaFREY:
All right, circle up, all.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.801
-Meeting time.
-Mm, no, no.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.136
LEROY:
This ain't over.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.905
So, new business.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.407
-Ah, finally.
-Yes!

02:53.441 --> 02:54.842
-Bring it.
-Awesome. All right.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.210
Going out in the field, baby.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.645
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.480
It was a... it was a question.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.181
Is there any new business?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.885
Well, your voice didn't go up
at the end,

03:04.918 --> 03:06.220
indicating a question, so...

03:06.254 --> 03:08.889
Well, it was still a question.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.761
You can't do this to us.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.429
BARRY: Speakers
of the Spanish persuasion

03:15.463 --> 03:17.064
put an upside-down question mark
at the beginning

03:17.097 --> 03:18.499
of every question.
It's very clear.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.900
LINDA: Yeah,
but that's a written thing.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.602
How could anyone do that
verbally?

03:21.635 --> 03:24.071
-LaFREY: All right, look, guys,

03:24.104 --> 03:27.375
I know that things
have been slow lately,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.543
and that is hard
on all of us.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.545
Okay? Maybe especially me,

03:31.579 --> 03:33.747
because I recently had
to move my mother

03:33.781 --> 03:35.516
into an assisted living
facility,

03:35.549 --> 03:38.252
and, let's face it,
work was a welcome distraction.

03:38.286 --> 03:41.188
But she just can't be
on her own anymore.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.190
She thinks
she's on the Titanic.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.560
Not the, uh... not the ship,
but, uh, in the movie Titanic.

03:46.594 --> 03:51.131
She, um, keeps asking
to talk to the director.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.401
So...

03:53.434 --> 03:55.969
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

03:56.003 --> 03:58.205
How about we get some color
in here

03:58.238 --> 04:01.575
Like, new drapes, carpet,
something to just

04:01.609 --> 04:03.477
bring it up,
bring the whole thing up.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.819
BARRY: Remember that girl
I was telling you about?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.588
She notices me,
hands me the book.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.791
So, in the space of ten minutes,

04:17.825 --> 04:21.295
I get a free latte-- bang--
and a free book. Bang.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.331
-KEN: That is great.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.466
Yeah, there's a full stop
at the end of that story,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.100
'cause that's all
you need to know-- free latte.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.138
KEN:
Yeah, I would love to.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.573
BARRY:
This afternoon?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.177
ANNIE:
Yeah, a good movie, I'm in.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.089
Don't look at me like that.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.492
I'm just a little disappointed.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.960
You used to be a badass.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.828
I still am.

04:54.862 --> 04:59.166
You're a desk cop...
in a cartoon agency.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.804
Oh, yeah?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.374
MAX:
Leroy!

05:06.407 --> 05:08.576
Just...

05:13.347 --> 05:15.516
I'd like to offer
my apologies.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.518
I'd like to think
I wasn't gonna throw this bottle

05:17.551 --> 05:19.820
through that window,
but, either way,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.021
it's not representative
of who I am.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.289
Put that bottle down.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.692
-Yeah.
Okay?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.460
-Yeah.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.661
All right.
Let's get out of here.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.702
You all right?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.904
Yeah.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.338
-All right.
-Ooh...

05:43.343 --> 05:45.212
I'm jealous of those taco guys.

05:45.245 --> 05:49.149
They come to work, they know
exactly what they're doing--

05:49.182 --> 05:50.918
making delicious tacos.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.220
It's hot back there.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.655
Those guys are on their feet
all day.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.524
I don't really want to do it.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.893
You seek purpose.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.595
That's my point.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.065
I ever tell you
my grand philosophy?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.334
-You might have, I don't know.
-All right.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.571
We're only on this Earth
for a short time.

06:10.604 --> 06:14.508
And we're on other Earths
for a longer time

06:14.542 --> 06:16.343
in other universes, so,

06:16.376 --> 06:19.613
as long as the other me's
are out there snowboarding

06:19.647 --> 06:21.882
and getting chicks,
it takes the pressure off me.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.584
-I'm not so into that.
-Well, it works for me.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.853
-It doesn't.
-No, I said it does.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.854
We're in prison.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.556
-Oh, come...

06:28.589 --> 06:30.223
Ours has no windows,

06:30.257 --> 06:32.292
it's 50 feet underground.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.528
Everyone down there
is losing their minds.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.063
You can't see it?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.231
What did we do wrong?

06:38.265 --> 06:41.301
What did we do... so wrong?

06:49.309 --> 06:50.711
I can't go down there.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.347
-Mm-mm.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.417
-I'll miss you.
-No, you won't.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.419
-A little.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.989
-That's off, Max.
-All right.

07:02.022 --> 07:02.990
Wh

07:03.023 --> 07:04.625
Tell 'em anything.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.426
I'll tell 'em you're up here.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.398
You happy?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.300
Automatic.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.235
Hey, what's down here?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.004
Fake office or something.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.798
*

08:09.322 --> 08:11.992
Someone's at the perimeter.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.110
You.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.155
Where is it?
There, I see.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.125
Now, here it is.
Wait for it.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.196
Boom.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.731
I'm Sam Dougald.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.432
I'm with, uh,
West Whistle Distribution.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.769
-Oh.
-And, uh, man,
today is my lucky day.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.939
-Well, I am if you're open.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.540
LEROY :
You're just driving around,

09:00.574 --> 09:02.743
-Excellent question.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.378
Uh, I was just, uh, getting
a taco, and I saw your sign.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.280
LEROY: Where do you normally
fill your hanger needs?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.082
Well, I got a couple places
in China.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.251
In fact, I had three containers
coming in last week.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.953
The ship got taken by pirates.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.221
Seems like a lot of work

09:14.254 --> 09:16.023
for a bunch of hangers,
but, I mean,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.625
I guess there's other stuff
on the ship besides that, huh?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.526
-Hmm.
-Anyway,

09:19.559 --> 09:22.529
it puts me about a week late
on an order for my best client.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.033
Ooh. Okay.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.801
All right, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you come on in here

09:27.835 --> 09:29.803
-and let me see
what I can do for you.
-Okeydokey, spiffy.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.905
-Mm.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.907
He's continuing the evaluation.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.543
-It's a cautious move.
-MAX: No.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.246
He's gonna sell him
some hangers.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.281
We're a family business.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.451
My father made wire hangers,
and...

09:44.484 --> 09:47.054
and his father was an apprentice
of a wire hanger maker.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.956
-Oh.
-That's really how
it all started.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.925
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, yeah, it was
their dream for me to...

09:51.959 --> 09:54.061
go to college.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.064
-You know, I-I went to,
uh, Whittier College.
-Mm.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.232
-So did Richard Nixon.
-Richard Nixon.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.269
Fun fact, Richard Nixon
used wire hangers on his suits.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.603
Very unusual.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.172
:
Yeah, I was gonna say.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.474
-You use wood hangers for that.
: Right?

10:07.507 --> 10:09.009
Oh, man.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.578
I like you, Sam.
I like the way you walk.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.480
You-you have
a pleasant way about you.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.649
Oh, all right. Ha-ha! Yeah.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.685
-I want to be in business
with you.
-Okay.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.619
Can I see
a bulk pricing breakdown?

10:19.653 --> 10:20.854
Ah, not so fast.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.322
We here at Mid-Valley Hangers

10:22.355 --> 10:24.658
are not just
in the hanger business.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.926
Okay?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.194
We're in the...

10:27.227 --> 10:29.196
"keep your clothes up here,

10:29.229 --> 10:31.231
not on the floor" business.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.168
They... they sound the same.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.637
Mostly... well, actually,
entirely with hangers.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.306
If I had my druthers,

10:39.339 --> 10:42.175
I'd, uh, use nothing
but rubber-dipped wood hangers,

10:42.209 --> 10:44.477
: but, you know,
I'm no Rockefeller.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.814
-LEROY: Yeah.
-So...

10:46.847 --> 10:48.782
Anyway, can I see some samples?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.650
You mean, like,
some different...?

10:50.684 --> 10:53.220
Yeah, if I could just see what,
you know, I'd be ordering.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.621
Say that.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.556
-I'll be right back.
-Mm. Thank you.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.258
Mm, yeah. Go, go, go, go.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.662
Whoa. Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.071
Thank you, Barry.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.639
Max, you seeing this?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.641
-I'm reeling in

11:14.674 --> 11:15.876
a live one, baby!

11:15.909 --> 11:17.778
It makes no sense!
Come join me!

11:24.551 --> 11:26.086
-Ken, not your chair, Ken.
Not your chair.
-You didn't call fives.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.520
-Move. Move. Move.
-You didn't call fives!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.394
Hey.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.896
Mind if I...

11:35.929 --> 11:38.531
tape this up to the side
of your desk here?

11:38.565 --> 11:39.933
No.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.572
Hey, does it feel like a prison
down here to you?

11:45.605 --> 11:47.875
If what you're saying is...

11:47.908 --> 11:50.410
I should bring the cat to work,

11:50.443 --> 11:53.080
that would make it worse.
I hate him.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.883
Every day I accidentally leave
the door open,

11:55.916 --> 11:57.050
but that cat won't leave.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.954
God...

12:05.092 --> 12:07.094
*

12:21.474 --> 12:23.476
*

12:51.771 --> 12:53.773
*

12:56.209 --> 12:57.677
Oh, my G...

13:02.049 --> 13:05.618
So, this is our best seller,
and this is our worst seller.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.320
Would you say at this point
you're leaning

13:07.354 --> 13:08.989
towards our best
or worst seller?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.358
Well, what about
that wooden hanger?

13:11.391 --> 13:14.094
You know, on-on the sign,
it just says "Wire Hangers."

13:14.127 --> 13:17.530
Between you and me...
we do dabble in wood.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.367
Well, I mean, I guess you have
to in today's climate, right?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.635
-Adapt or die.
-You got a good business head
on your shoulders.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.938
Yeah.
Also, can I see a-a price sheet

13:24.972 --> 13:26.506
-No.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.976
No. You don't get it.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.144
-I truly don't.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.213
I'm good.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.348
Right on. That's cool.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.650
Hey, I have some great news--
we're having

13:37.684 --> 13:39.452
-a one-day-only sale.
-Mm.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.622
All gloves and capes 50% off.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.491
Here's some... info on that.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.793
Hey. I'm Max.
I'm Leroy's business partner.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.630
-Yeah.
-Uh, I thought
this was a family business.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.232
Yeah, we're brothers.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.901
Yep.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.204
-You want to check out
that note from Dad?
-Oh.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.073
-Yes, yes, yes. Um...
-About our, uh,
sale policies and stuff.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.377
Is Dad serious about this sale?

14:04.411 --> 14:05.412
Yeah.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.746
-Nobody.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.482
I didn't want word of the sale
to get out.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.018
Smart.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.020
Well, okay.
But why would you have a sale

14:13.053 --> 14:14.721
that you don't want anybody
to know about?

14:14.754 --> 14:16.924
MAX:
Yeah, I mean,

14:16.957 --> 14:18.926
it's 50% off,
so you lose a bunch of money.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.760
-It's a big sale.
-Yeah, but then just don't have

14:20.793 --> 14:23.897
-the sale then.
-Well, you haven't met Dad.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.332
:
You do not know our dad.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.733
-Guess not.
-MAX: No.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.401
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Leroy,
you want to come down,

14:28.435 --> 14:30.870
-Yeah, yeah.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.139
How do you look
at a sale, though?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.480
LEROY:
Hey, Michelle.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.363
-What is tha-- ah.
-Shh.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.864
Oh.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.733
Well, that is a banana, Barry.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.236
Haven't you ever seen
a banana before?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.941
No, I've not seen
a banana before.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.743
I've seen pictures of them.
Thank you for showing me one.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.212
Well, there's no need
to be ashamed of...

15:12.245 --> 15:13.981
about not seeing common foods.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.617
-I've seen a peach.
-BARRY: Yeah.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.121
-Apples.
-LaFREY: Apples are America's
favorite fruit, I think.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.962
I don't like kiwi.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.268
-Whoa.
-Shh. No.

15:35.302 --> 15:39.606
The weather is very bright
and fresh.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.441
I tend not to notice
the weather.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.742
BARRY:
You would notice a tornado.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.978
They are loud
and they don't care.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.415
KEN:
I have never seen...

15:48.448 --> 15:50.150
a tornado.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.020
BARRY:
If you saw a tornado,

15:53.053 --> 15:54.487
you'd know not to joke around
about them.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.488
Listen, guys, I want to tell you
why I'm taking

15:55.522 --> 15:57.924
this tornado thing so seriously.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.593
I used to live
in a trailer park,

16:00.627 --> 16:03.530
and, you know,
the tornado came...

16:03.563 --> 16:07.467
and it wiped
the whole thing away.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.602
Barry, thank you.
I think I speak for everyone

16:09.636 --> 16:11.004
when I say
you're an inspiration.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.105
Okay.

16:12.139 --> 16:16.676
What... about... monsoons?

16:21.148 --> 16:25.218
Death Valley is
the hottest place on Earth.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.986
Don't you think?

16:29.056 --> 16:30.823
-ANNIE: Copy on Death Valley.
-BARRY: But within its heat

16:30.857 --> 16:32.559
is an intense beauty.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.628
Sam? Hi. Annie.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.829
This is Barry.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.998
-Hello.
-Leroy's been detained.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.468
Oh, uh-- I'm sorry.
I hope everything's all right.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.070
-Mm.
-Would you like
a glass of water?

16:43.103 --> 16:44.337
Oh, no, thank you.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.805
Your-your fingers are in it.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.340
Oh, rude.
Brought it all this way.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.875
-Two miles.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.677
-Go on. Yeah.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.712
I guess I'll just take this
and-and

16:52.745 --> 16:54.481
-maybe keep it
in case I need it later.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.915
-Too late.
You missed your chance.
-Okay.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.922
Mm-hmm.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.024
Would you like to see
a picture of my dog?

17:05.058 --> 17:06.993
Oh, it's very cute.
What's its name?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.695
-He has no name.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.430
-I don't like dogs.
-Okay.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.732
Are we expecting Leroy
anytime soon?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.905
LaFREY: Mom,
you don't know James Cameron.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.373
Okay, well, even if there were,

17:20.407 --> 17:22.342
you wouldn't be invited
to that party anyway

17:22.375 --> 17:24.010
because you are not
a first-class passenger.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.779
No, you would be downstairs
with Leo.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.849
No, Mom, you--
no, you don't need the dress.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.585
Because you weren't cast
as a first-class passenger.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.986
You're more like an extra.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.730
I will pass this along.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.198
You finish up here.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.433
Mm-hmm.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.101
Good news, Sam.

17:48.135 --> 17:51.104
I can sell you
however many hangers you like...

17:51.138 --> 17:53.640
at whatever price you choose.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.443
What's your price, Sam?

17:56.476 --> 17:58.611
BARRY:
Mm.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.046
Well, there's one.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.948
If you could just sign here
and here.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.650
-Pen.
-Yeah.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.086
It is a, uh, pleasure
doing business with you.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.088
-My God.
-Uh-huh.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.760
MAX:
Up there. Up there.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.464
Look at that.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.936
:
Okay.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.352
Do you think they're closed?

18:39.386 --> 18:41.020
LEROY:
They're never closed.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.062
*

19:30.403 --> 19:33.606
: Open the door.
-Okay.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.489
MAX:
So, who would want to bug us?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.890
Not here. We don't know
if it's safe to talk.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.260
There's a safe house in Carson.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.927
Oh, well, this time of day,

19:54.961 --> 19:56.263
southbound traffic
would be awful.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.730
I mean, coming back
would be okay.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.931
LEROY: If those bugs
were there long enough,

19:58.965 --> 20:00.700
they'll know
about the safe houses.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.336
What about the steam room
at my racket club?

20:03.370 --> 20:04.604
ANNIE: We're not the ones
wearing the wires.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.038
We don't need to be in towels.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.574
The racquetball court?

20:07.607 --> 20:08.708
Too hard to get
in those little doors.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.109
Okay, but, at some point,
I'd love

20:10.142 --> 20:11.611
to have you all at the club.
It's beautiful.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.079
LaFREY: Okay, look,
let's just huddle up close,

20:13.112 --> 20:14.213
and maybe we can talk
right here.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.448
Okay, come on.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.250
-Everybody in.
-Okay.

20:17.284 --> 20:20.186
Let's start
with the essential question--

20:20.219 --> 20:22.355
-BIRD: I know who did it.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.923
It's the Scientologists.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.792
The aliens who are in cahoots
with the Scientologists...

20:25.825 --> 20:29.128
Okay, Bird, would you mind
getting the binoculars

20:29.161 --> 20:30.863
and seeing if there are
any raccoons around?

20:30.897 --> 20:33.733
Okay, I know
you're being dismissive,

20:33.766 --> 20:35.568
and I know that you know

20:35.602 --> 20:37.236
that I have a strong interest
in raccoons,

20:37.270 --> 20:39.272
but why not look?

20:40.807 --> 20:43.710
Okay, any other theories?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.278
Well, maybe it's not
a conspiracy at all.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.447
It's just the taco guys
being curious.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.716
Okay, yeah.
Davey, why don't you go grab

20:49.749 --> 20:52.151
a bunch of burgers
for everybody, okay?

20:52.184 --> 20:53.286
-No.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.421
-Yeah.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.956
-Stop it.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.060
All right, look, guys,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.129
a team is coming
to sweep the office.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.732
Until then, remain cautious.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.500
Let's stay on the trail
while it's hot.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.635
Let's not miss a thing.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.169
-All right. Okay.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.274
* You know I'm bad
at communication *

21:15.308 --> 21:17.143
* It's the hardest thing
for me to do... *

21:17.176 --> 21:19.512
Hey.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.948
That was a good catch,
finding that wire.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.182
You stayed with it.

21:23.215 --> 21:26.285
Ah, I was lucky.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.820
No, no, no, no...

21:27.854 --> 21:29.956
it was very lucky.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.993
I'm just saying,
it's good to be back, Mulder.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.129
I don't know the show.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.499
* But I just couldn't take it

21:39.532 --> 21:41.300
* I tried hard not to fake it

21:41.334 --> 21:44.871
* But I fumbled it
when it came down to the wire *

21:44.904 --> 21:47.874
* It felt right,
oh, it felt... *

21:47.907 --> 21:49.909

Media Access Group at WGBH

21:52.311 --> 21:54.313
You've explored the paranormal

Now here are a few more shows
