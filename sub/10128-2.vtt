Cory: IN CASE YOU DIDN'T SEE
LAST WEEK'S<i>BOY MEETS WORLD,</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:28.600
HERE'S WHY I HAVE
THIS LOOK ON MY FACE.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.600
AND DO YOU, TOPANGA,
TAKE CORY
TO BE YOUR HUSBAND,

00:31.600 --> 00:33.500
TO HONOR
AND CHERISH HIM,

00:33.500 --> 00:34.900
FOR RICHER, FOR POORER,

00:34.900 --> 00:36.667
IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH,

00:36.667 --> 00:39.600
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

00:41.934 --> 00:44.300
I...

00:45.867 --> 00:46.400
I...

00:46.400 --> 00:48.600
DO.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.700
I...

00:49.700 --> 00:51.934
WE GOT "I."
WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR "DO."

00:51.934 --> 00:54.200
Topanga: I...

00:54.200 --> 00:56.900
THIS IS JUST
THE STRANGEST THING.

00:56.900 --> 00:57.900
EXCUSE ME.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.233
TOPANGA, LISTEN.
YOU CAN DO THIS, OK?

01:00.233 --> 01:01.300
I DID IT.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.834
I WAS A REAL MAN
ABOUT IT.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.200
NOW, DON'T LEAVE ME UP HERE
IN MY WEDDING DRESS.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.300
LET ME TRY THIS AGAIN.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.300
OK.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.667
NOW WE'RE COOKIN'
WITH GAS.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.300
I...

01:12.300 --> 01:13.300
DO.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.100
DO...
DO...
DO...

01:16.667 --> 01:18.133
CAN'T.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.133
I CAN'T.

01:21.133 --> 01:24.000
OH, YOU HATE TO SEE THAT!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.400
I'M SORRY, CORY.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.734
I'M SO SORRY, JUDGE BEMIS.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.400
FOOFIE.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.600
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.800
WHAT'S THAT, SON?

01:38.300 --> 01:40.100
<i>SHE </i>ASKED<i>ME.</i>

01:47.200 --> 01:50.800
BOY, I AM SO SORRY
MY FAMILY MISSED THAT.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.600
I'M SORRY, CORY.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.200
WOW!

01:54.200 --> 01:55.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.800
DO!

01:56.800 --> 01:58.900
YOU KNOW, DO?

01:58.900 --> 02:00.967
IT'S THE FIRST HALF
OF YOUR FAVORITE
WORD--DON'T.

02:00.967 --> 02:02.467
I DON'T LIKE YOUR TONE.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.500
YOU DON'T LIKE--

02:03.500 --> 02:05.000
I DRIVE 1,000 MILES
TO MARRY HER

02:05.000 --> 02:06.700
AND SHE DON'T LIKE
MY TONE.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.867
THAT IS REALLY RICH.

02:07.867 --> 02:09.700
I WANT MY FAMILY
TO BE AT MY WEDDING.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.867
I WANT YOUR FAMILY
TO BE THERE.

02:11.867 --> 02:14.033
CORY, I WANT TO WEAR
A WEDDING DRESS.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.600
A WHITE, LACY WEDDING DRESS.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.667
OF COURSE WHITE.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.200
THE WAY WE'RE GOING,
BRIGHT WHITE.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200
SNOW WHITE.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.100
WHITER THAN
THE WHITE-HOT LIGHT

02:21.100 --> 02:23.400
OF A THOUSAND
BURNING SUNS!

02:23.400 --> 02:26.367
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA BE MAD AT ME?

02:26.367 --> 02:28.900
10 MINUTES.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.767
WE RAISE CORY CAREFULLY.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.700
WE TEACH HIM
EVERYTHING WE KNOW,

02:35.700 --> 02:36.900
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN,

02:36.900 --> 02:39.100
AND THEN WE DISAGREE
OVER ONE THING,

02:39.100 --> 02:40.500
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE'S GONE.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.033
HE'S NOT GONE.

02:42.033 --> 02:44.233
HE'S A GOOD KID.
HE WOULD NEVER GET MARRIED
WITHOUT US.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.233
ARE YOU SURE?

02:45.233 --> 02:48.100
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.233
BUT WHAT THE HECK.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.300
WE'RE HAVING ANOTHER ONE,
AREN'T WE? HMM?

02:51.300 --> 02:55.000
I'M GIVING YOU
THE NEXT 18 YEARS
OF MY LIFE.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.967
DON'T YOU EVER DO
ANYTHING WITHOUT ME.

02:56.967 --> 02:58.200
HE WON'T.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.066
AND NEITHER WILL I.

03:00.066 --> 03:01.600
SO COME ON,
LET'S ALL GO TO BED, OK?

03:01.600 --> 03:02.967
COME ON,
IT'S QUARTER AFTER 3:00.

03:02.967 --> 03:05.400
ONLY CREEPS AND WEIRDOES
ARE UP NOW.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.500
HOW YA DOIN'?

03:07.500 --> 03:10.000
YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER, WEREN'T YOU?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.600
YEAH. I GOT
A 6-FOOT-TALL
WONDER WOMAN

03:11.600 --> 03:12.700
SLEEPING IN THE ROOM
NEXT TO ME.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.500
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
MY BROTHER, THOUGH. YEAH.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.200
WELL, I COULDN'T SLEEP,
IF YOU KNOW MY CURRENT
"SITCHEEATION,"

03:20.200 --> 03:21.467
AND THERE'S NOTHING
ON TV,

03:21.467 --> 03:24.000
SO--HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING UP?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.600
THE ONLY PEOPLE UP NOW
ARE CREEPS AND WEIRDOES.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.834
HOW YA DOIN'?

03:27.834 --> 03:29.400
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.567
18 YEARS
I'M HIS BEST FRIEND.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.667
I RAISE HIM RIGHT,
TEACH HIM EVERYTHING I KNOW.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.000
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED THEM
TO GET MARRIED.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.400
YEAH, BUT NOT WITHOUT ME.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST MAN.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.700
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST MAN.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.367
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
THEY ELOPED.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.500
THEY COULDN'T CHOOSE
BETWEEN US.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.000
NO, ERIC. NO.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.967
THEY ELOPED BECAUSE
YOUR PARENTS TRIED TO
TELL THEM WHAT TO DO,

03:48.967 --> 03:51.300
SO THEY DROVE UP TO SOME
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
UP NORTH.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.233
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
ON MY MACHINE.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.100
YOU HEARD FROM HIM?
HE REALLY DID GET MARRIED?

03:55.100 --> 03:59.133
HE'S A GOOD KID?
HE'LL NEVER GET MARRIED
WITHOUT US?

03:59.133 --> 04:00.500
I AM KEEPING
MY KNEES TOGETHER

04:00.500 --> 04:02.700
AND THIS ONE
IS NEVER GETTING OUT.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.300
CAN I CRASH
ON YOU GUYS' COUCH?

04:04.300 --> 04:05.400
I DON'T WANT
TO BE UP THIS LATE

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
WITH ALL THE CREEPS
AND WEIRDOES.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.033
HOW YA DOIN'?

04:10.033 --> 04:11.734
HI, GEORGE.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.300
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.400
WHY NOT?

04:14.400 --> 04:17.500
WELL, YOU GOT ALL
THE LIGHTS ON.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
EVERYBODY'S YELLING.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
AND ERIC PARKED HIS CAR
IN MY GARDEN.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
SO? WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU CARE?
YOU'RE MOVING.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.667
GO HEAD, FEENY, RETIRE.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BEST AT.

04:27.667 --> 04:31.133
THE MAN HAS GIVEN
THE LAST 40 YEARS
OF HIS LIFE TEACHING PEOPLE.

04:31.133 --> 04:34.300
DON'T CARE.
KILL HIS FLOWERS.
KILL HIM.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.300
ERIC.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.867
WHEN SOMEONE YOU CARE FOR

04:36.867 --> 04:39.800
MAKES A CONSIDERED DECISION
TO CHANGE HIS LIFE,

04:39.800 --> 04:43.233
THEN THOSE WHO DO CARE
SHOULD OFFER THEIR SUPPORT...

04:43.233 --> 04:45.900
AND RESPECT HIS DECISION.

04:45.900 --> 04:49.734
OH, FEENY,
YOU HAD ME AT "ERIC."
COME HERE.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.100
YOU'RE RIGHT, GEORGE.
WE SHOULD ACCEPT
WHAT THEY'VE DONE

04:54.100 --> 04:56.300
AND DO SOMETHING
TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.967
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
CORY AND TOPANGA HERE.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.066
CORY AND TOPANGA?

05:00.066 --> 05:04.367
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
A GOING-AWAY PARTY FOR ME.

05:04.367 --> 05:05.967
GOING AWAY?
YOU'RE STILL GOING AWAY?

05:05.967 --> 05:09.700
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE,
STOP WITH THE MIND GAMES, MAN.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.100
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE REASON
I CAN'T SELL MY HOUSE.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.700
PUT THE MIRROR BACK.

05:20.700 --> 05:25.100
GEE, SORRY, I'LL PUT IT BACK
JUST LIKE YOU HAD IT. THERE.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.400
GREAT. NOW I CAN SEE
IF THERE ARE ANY CARS
COMING AT MY CROTCH!

05:28.400 --> 05:30.367
STOP SNAPPING AT ME.

05:30.367 --> 05:31.934
WE RAN OFF TOGETHER,
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT WE DID?

05:31.934 --> 05:33.400
NOTHING.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.500
OUR BIG DRAMATIC MOMENT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WE DID? NOTHIN'.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.667
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
A BIG DRAMATIC MOMENT, CORY!

05:40.734 --> 05:42.200
IT'S NOT RIGHT
TO RUN OFF TOGETHER

05:42.200 --> 05:44.133
BECAUSE WE THINK
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE.

05:44.133 --> 05:46.567
WHEN WE GET MARRIED,
I WANT TO HAVE A BIG CAKE.

05:46.567 --> 05:49.000
I WANT DOVES.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.400
NO DOVES.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.400
YOU WERE RIGHT.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.700
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.600
OUR MARRIAGE SHOULD BE
A CELEBRATION,

06:02.600 --> 06:03.867
NOT A SECRET.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.400
THANK YOU.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.300
YOU OWE ME THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.200
IT'S YOURS.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.667
HEY, RACHEL,
WHAT'S UP?

06:28.667 --> 06:30.033
RACHEL, HOW YOU DOIN'?

06:30.033 --> 06:31.033
WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?

06:31.033 --> 06:33.467
I AM MAKING YOU TWO
FRENCH TOAST.

06:33.467 --> 06:36.867
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO DO IT EVERY DAY, SO
DON'T GET SPOILED, OK?

06:36.867 --> 06:37.867
OK.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.667
JACK, JACK, JACKIE,
JACK, JACK.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.800
LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE,
EAT ALL YOUR VEGETABLES,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.400
HONOR YOU FATHER
AND YOUR MOTHER,

06:44.400 --> 06:47.500
AND HEAVEN WILL REWARD YOU
WITH A HOT-HOT-HOTTIE-HOT
HOTTIE-HOTTIE-HOT-HOT

06:47.500 --> 06:49.100
FOR A ROOMMATE.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.100
I NEED TO TELL
YOU TWO SOMETHING.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.300
DON'T LEAVE.
WE'LL DO ANYTHING.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.367
WHEN I MET YOU,
I WAS IN REALLY
BAD SHAPE.

06:55.367 --> 06:58.500
BUT YOU TWO,
YOU TOOK ME IN.
YOU RESCUED ME.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.800
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW HOW GRATEFUL
I AM TO YOU.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.667
I AM SO LUCKY.
YOU GUYS ARE MY HEROES.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.900
NO,<i>THANK YOU.</i>

07:08.900 --> 07:10.100
OH, THANKS.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.600
HEY, WE'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE LUCKY.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
OH...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.000
COME HERE, YOU.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.467
ONE MORE.

07:16.734 --> 07:19.033
AH...
AH...
AH...

07:19.033 --> 07:20.200
EXCUSE ME.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.200
OK.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.400
OH. BY THE WAY,

07:22.400 --> 07:23.834
I PROMISE
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
A BATHROOM HOG,

07:23.834 --> 07:27.467
BUT I REALLY DO LIKE
TO START THE MORNING
WITH A BUBBLE BATH.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.734
I LIKE TO PUT IN
ALL THE AROMA
THERAPY BEADS

07:29.734 --> 07:31.000
AND ALL THE BUBBLES,
AND...

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
IT'S JUST MY FAVORITE
PART OF THE DAY.
IS THAT OK?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
YEAH.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.900
I DEMAND
YOU TAKE BUBBLE BATHS.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.500
REALLY? WHY?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.767
WHY?

07:39.767 --> 07:40.967
JACK?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.467
WELL, UM...

07:43.467 --> 07:46.934
UH...YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE
BUBBLE BATHS,

07:46.934 --> 07:48.567
THAT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE--

07:48.567 --> 07:49.567
COMFORTABLE.

07:49.567 --> 07:50.700
WITH US.
LIVING HERE WITH US.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.367
WE JUST WANT YOU
TO BE YOURSELF.

07:52.367 --> 07:53.367

07:53.367 --> 07:54.400
OH, YOU GUYS.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.667
YOU KNOW,
I AM THIS CLOSE
TO BEING GLAD

07:56.667 --> 07:58.567
THAT MY BOYFRIEND
ACTUALLY LEFT ME.

07:58.567 --> 07:59.567
NO!
NO!

07:59.567 --> 08:02.133
HUH.
PLEASE.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.400
OH, MAN.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.200
THAT GIRL
IS TAKING A BUBBLE BATH

08:05.200 --> 08:08.100
IN THE BATHTUB
OF OUR BATHROOM.
WE'RE GENIUSES.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.300
DUDE.

08:09.300 --> 08:12.467
DON'T KNOW IF THIS
IS THE RIGHT TIME
TO SAY...

08:12.467 --> 08:14.900
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.500
DUDE. DON'T EVEN, MAN.

DUDE!

08:19.800 --> 08:21.967
DUDE! COME HERE!

08:21.967 --> 08:23.400
Rachel: OH, BOYS,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.367
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO WORK THE STOPPER
IN THE BATHTUB.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.767
COULD ONE OF YOU PLEASE
COME SHOW ME?

08:36.033 --> 08:37.033
CORY, WAIT.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.400
I'M SCARED.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.667
I DON'T WANT YOUR
PARENTS TO BE MAD AT ME.
I LOVE THEM.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.000
WELL, THEY ARE
GONNA BE MAD.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.667
TOPANGA--IN FACT,
IF I KNOW ANYTHING,

08:43.667 --> 08:45.100
THEY ARE
GONNA BE FURIOUS.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.033
CONGRATULATIONS,
NEWLYWEDS!

08:50.033 --> 08:50.800
CONGRATULATIONS!

18:15.867 --> 18:17.900
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF YOU, CORY.

18:17.900 --> 18:21.033
YOU STOOD UP FOR
WHAT YOU BELIEVED IN,

18:21.033 --> 18:23.200
AND YOU MADE
YOUR OWN DECISION.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.133
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
TOPANGA WAS RIGHT.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.100
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG
TO GET MARRIED

18:27.100 --> 18:28.934
JUST BECAUSE
YOU SAID WE SHOULDN'T.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.700
I RAISED A GOOD MAN.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.033
YOU CALLING ME A MAN?

18:36.100 --> 18:37.700
YEAH. YOU WANT TO
GET OFF THAT SWING

18:37.700 --> 18:39.500
AND DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT?

18:39.500 --> 18:42.300
YEAH, I DO.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.900
WE CAME DOWN HERE
TO TELL YOU GUYS

18:53.900 --> 18:55.734
THAT WE WILL ALWAYS
BE HERE FOR YOU

18:55.734 --> 18:56.967
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.500
AND THE ONE THING
WE DON'T EVER WANT TO DO

18:58.500 --> 19:02.400
IS MAKE YOU FEEL
AFRAID TO COME TO US
WITH ANY IMPORTANT DECISION.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.200
UH, WELL, WE--
WE HAVE MADE A DECISION.

19:04.200 --> 19:08.600
IN FACT, I THINK WE'VE MADE
THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION
OF OUR LIVES.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.133
WE LOVE YOU BOTH.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.300
AND NOW THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A WEDDING,

19:13.300 --> 19:15.700
YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED THIS.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.700
THIS WAS MY MOTHER'S
ENGAGEMENT RING,

19:18.700 --> 19:21.367
AND I WOULD BE HONORED
IF YOU WOULD WEAR IT.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.200
AMY...

19:23.200 --> 19:25.233
I WANT IT TO STAY
IN THE FAMILY.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.300
HOLD IT.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.700
REMEMBER ME? CORY?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.600
DON'T I GET TO DO ANYTHING?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.200
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.834
I DON'T GET TO PROPOSE,
I DON'T GET TO PUT THE RING
ON HER HAND,

19:33.834 --> 19:35.000
I DON'T GET TO DO NOTHIN'.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.967
WELCOME TO MARRIAGE.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.200
CORY, WE HAVE
A LOT TO DO.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.567
WE HAVE
A WHOLE WEDDING
TO PLAN.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.667
ACTUALLY, NO, WE DON'T.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.300
WHAT?

19:43.300 --> 19:44.400
YOU SAID NO TO HER?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.200
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.300
I TOLD YOU,
WE MADE A DECISION.
WE MADE IT TOGETHER.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.500
WE LISTENED TO OUR FRIENDS,

19:50.500 --> 19:52.100
AND WE LISTENED
TO OUR FAMILIES,

19:52.100 --> 19:53.600
BUT WE MADE IT ON OUR OWN.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.700
SO, WHAT DID YOU DECIDE?

19:55.700 --> 20:00.000
I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO FIRST.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.767
TOPANGA.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.400
COME HERE.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.900
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
OUR ENTIRE LIVES.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.600
AND YOU KNOW
THAT I--I LOVE YOU

20:09.600 --> 20:12.567
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.767
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

20:15.767 --> 20:17.500
YES, CORY.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.033
YES, I WILL.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.700
ALL RIGHT, ALREADY.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.200
WHEN'S THE WEDDING?

20:30.200 --> 20:31.400
THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.834
WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
WHEN WE'RE READY.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.700
AND WHEN WE'RE READY,
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

20:47.734 --> 20:50.233
SO, HAVE A GREAT TIME
IN JACKSON HOLE.

20:50.233 --> 20:51.834
HERE'S TO
YOUR RETIREMENT, GEORGE.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.900

20:53.900 --> 20:55.200
THANK YOU, ALAN.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.900

20:56.900 --> 20:58.400
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TIME

20:58.400 --> 21:02.467
FOR FEENY'S FAVORITE STUDENT
TO MAKE A SPEECH, HUH?

21:03.500 --> 21:04.667
FOR 40 YEARS

21:04.667 --> 21:08.367
I HAVE WATCHED YOU EDUCATE
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN...

21:08.367 --> 21:10.400
BOY, HAVE I.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.133
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DO THIS.

21:14.133 --> 21:15.767
THIS IS A MISTAKE,

21:15.767 --> 21:18.800
AND I DO NOT SUPPORT IT!

21:18.800 --> 21:21.500
WHY COULDN'T YOU
HAVE JUST GONE TO YALE?
