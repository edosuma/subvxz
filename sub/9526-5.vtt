00:24.900 --> 00:27.069
It's a video that we made
for our rap group

00:27.194 --> 00:28.487
called "The Wizards."
- Sounds lame.

for less-

00:39.540 --> 00:40.708
- We'll do it
for three stacks.

00:40.833 --> 00:41.834
- What is that?

00:41.959 --> 00:42.960

- Well, I used to subscribe
to The Source, so, um,

00:51.886 --> 00:53.554
Dr. Dre once said,

00:53.679 --> 00:55.681
"Stack is a, like, $50-$500."

00:55.806 --> 00:57.600
So stacks-
- So three stacks would be...

00:57.725 --> 00:59.685
- Yeah.
- You know...

03:12.359 --> 03:13.360

- Yeah.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.029
- I always thought it was, like,

03:15.154 --> 03:16.864
a dance that you took
your mom to,

03:16.989 --> 03:18.324
and I did that.
I've already been there.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.742
I've done that.
Junior prom.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.244
My mom gets low, dude.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.662
- She's got a body on her.

03:23.788 --> 03:26.207
- My mom's body fucking rules.
- Yeah.

03:26.332 --> 03:27.625
- So it's two best friends,

03:27.750 --> 03:29.168
and one has been
wrongly imprisoned.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.586
- Ooh.
- But the movie is really

03:30.711 --> 03:32.338
about the wife banging
all the friends-

03:32.463 --> 03:34.131
And that is another porno!
Dang it!

03:34.256 --> 03:35.966
- Look, we just gotta think
of something that stands out-

03:36.091 --> 03:37.510
A story about people.

03:37.635 --> 03:39.678
- Like, what about, like,
a documentary?

03:39.804 --> 03:41.180
- Like Super Size Me.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.973
- You saw Super Size Me?
- Oh, no. Mm-mm.

03:43.098 --> 03:46.227
But when that movie came out,
they canceled supersizing,

03:46.352 --> 03:50.272
so I started getting a
number one and chicken selects.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.441
But when they went back
to supersizing, so did I.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.402
And now my body was addicted
to the selects,

03:55.528 --> 03:59.114
therefore transforming
my tight, slender, taut bod

03:59.240 --> 04:02.743
into this monstrosity!

04:02.868 --> 04:04.078
Just want to rip you off!

04:04.203 --> 04:05.538
Want to rip you off!

04:05.663 --> 04:07.248
You stupid fat!

04:07.373 --> 04:08.999
- Stop, man!
You're gonna bruise it again.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.167
You know that.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.460
Stop.
- I hate myself.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.254
I hate myself and my body,
but...

04:13.379 --> 04:16.257
I think that this can reverse
the effects, right?

04:16.382 --> 04:19.426
Okay? And it can be about health
foods that dudes like to eat,

04:19.552 --> 04:20.761
such as hot dogs.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.221
- We could call it
a "dog-umentary."

04:22.346 --> 04:23.848
[laughs]
- Exactly.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.182
They have all the carrots
inside of them

04:25.307 --> 04:26.559
that the cows ate,

04:26.684 --> 04:27.977
making them super,
ultra nutritious, right?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.020
- They're made
from cow buttholes.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.606
- I will eat 1,000 hot dogs
in one week,

04:32.731 --> 04:34.775
finally answering
the question,

04:34.900 --> 04:37.695
"Are hot dogs as healthy
as they say,

04:37.820 --> 04:39.655
or are they just okay
for you?"

04:39.780 --> 04:41.240
- Nope.
- No. Sounds stupid.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.783

04:42.908 --> 04:45.202

04:45.327 --> 04:48.789

04:48.914 --> 04:50.291
- Oh!
- Hey, man. Come on, dude.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.834
Don't take it personal.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.502
- It is wildly small, though.
- Stop, man.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.337
- That's not a bad idea.
No, it's crazy small.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.299

life with such a small penis?

04:58.424 --> 05:00.217

Gonna get a new dick.
- I want that one!

07:14.935 --> 07:16.270
I want it!
- [laughing] It's yours.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.105

I wish I could have it now-

on who you are?

07:52.097 --> 07:54.683
And just talk to my face.
- Okay.

the only sex-change expert

08:11.408 --> 08:13.243
Looks like I got a-
an opening next Friday.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.369
- Well, Friday after work-

08:14.495 --> 08:15.746
That works for me.
- Yeah.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.831
- Friday? That's hecka soon.
- Okay, Doc.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.043

- Highly dangerous.

It's ketchup.

I put ketchup in here.

Yeah.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.356
Wow. You can't buy
that kind of adrenaline.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.566
That guy really gave me a gift
right there.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.528

something there with...

- I don't know.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.433
Does Friday seem
a little bit too soon?

09:18.559 --> 09:20.602
Maybe we should get some other,
like, opinions or whatnot.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.020
That dude seemed a-
just a little bit shady.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.522
- Karl, are you kidding me?

09:23.647 --> 09:25.732
The guy is a pro,
plus the camera loves him.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.025
- For real?
- No, he seemed drunk to me.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.360
- All right.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.237
- You see
that hot assistant chick?

09:30.362 --> 09:32.114
She was totally
into my raw dogging.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.824
- She was hot.
- Not condom-less sex.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.493
I mean, like, me physically
eating raw hot dogs.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.453

- All that hot dog mud.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.510
Get back here, man.
We got you a new scene.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.304

"Shut up on set"?

It is a dog-eat-dog world,

- What is a stack'?
It's like, um-Blake?

10:18.035 --> 10:20.871

the Na San Thai Massage Parlor,

where our friend Karl
is going to get-

10:23.832 --> 10:27.169
Come on.
Going to get his final hand job.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.295
Let's see how he's doing.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.590
Psst
Hey,buddy

10:31.715 --> 10:32.716
Hey. How are you?

10:32.841 --> 10:34.218
- Good.
She's gonna jack me off.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.386
- That's awesome.
- Yes. It's extra to watch.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.388
- No, we're good.
- Yes. You pay extra.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.140
- That's just-That's bizarre.
- There's my guy.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.560
- Mmm, slurping it down,
my baby.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.020
Line me up.
Four more doggies.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.396
Naked, no bun.
Let's do this.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.606

10:47.731 --> 10:49.107
- I've eaten 97.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.692
You're gonna see me
enter the century club.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.319

That's-

10:54.112 --> 10:56.031
You're a hot dog vendor, man.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.824
You should be,
like, on my side.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.326
Hot dogs are healthy, okay?

10:59.451 --> 11:01.703
Just 'cause, like, cows,
they eat carrots,

11:01.828 --> 11:03.247
and I eat hot dogs,
therefore I'm gonna have

11:03.372 --> 11:05.624

that eagles have!

Take whatever you want!

it's like nobody respects

11:14.258 --> 11:16.218
the healing power
of hot dogs!

are you going to do

11:18.971 --> 11:20.347
with your juicy new dong?

11:20.472 --> 11:21.682
- Definitely wash it every day

11:21.807 --> 11:26.061
with Caress Daily Silky

11:26.186 --> 11:27.437
- [mouthing words]
- And, uh...

11:27.562 --> 11:29.356
yeah, and a loofah probably.
- Mm-hmm.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.024
- Which has always been
a dream of mine, but, you know,

11:31.149 --> 11:32.985
it just would get kind of lost
in the bubbles.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.903

- Oh, it sounds like

11:35.028 --> 11:38.323

to bust his last final nut.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.117
- That was quick.
- Why don't we join him-

11:40.242 --> 11:42.244
- Hey, um, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to eavesdrop,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.288
but I could have swore
I heard you say something

11:44.413 --> 11:47.874
about washing my penis
with something called a loofah?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.586
- Yes, and Caress Daily Silky
body wash.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.921
- Nice, nice.
- Silky, yes.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.798
- Oh-Oh, okay.
Now, see, Blake,

11:54.923 --> 11:57.342
that's where we're thinking
a little different.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.136
You know,
you can't wash my penis.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.846
It's never been washed.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.682
It doesn't respond well
to soap and water, all right?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.684
It's very well seasoned,
like a cast-iron pan.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.520
If anything, you just put
a moist towel on it

12:08.645 --> 12:10.314
and then hit it
with a lot of sand.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.274
- Oh, no.
I'm-l'd never do that.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.693
I'm not washing m-my dick
with sand.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.321
- No! You're gonna wash
<i>my</i> dick with some sand.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.698
- Right, but we're talking
about the future now

12:19.823 --> 12:22.701
when it's on my body,
so it's my dick.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.953
- Oh, I'm sorry.
It's still on my body, Blake.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.956
- Is everything okay?
- Jodi, back off!

12:28.081 --> 12:29.791
All right?
He's gonna ruin my dick!

12:29.916 --> 12:31.418
He's gonna wash it without sand!
- It's not his dick.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.046
It's my dick!
Jodi, what'd you do back there?

12:34.171 --> 12:36.089
Pull his brains
out of his ass?
