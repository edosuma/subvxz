WEBVTT

00:14.080 --> 00:15.760
Excellent work, guys!

00:15.800 --> 00:18.240
Shoulders.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.560
Tap your troubles away.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.680
For an hour,
I did manage to forget.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.000
That's it!
Tapping! Good work, girls!

00:26.040 --> 00:27.280
You too, Colin!

00:27.320 --> 00:29.400
Bring it forward.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.680
Excellent.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.720
Ankles!

00:41.880 --> 00:44.040
And 1-2-3-4. Arms!

00:50.600 --> 00:54.000
Ready? And down. Hey!

00:54.040 --> 00:56.360
Awesome, guys.
That was so good.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
Have a quick breather.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.480
And we're gonna end
with a cool-down routine.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.320
- Fabulous!
- So good.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.760
Better?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.040
Err...

01:07.480 --> 01:09.120
- You're a natural.
- Oh!

01:09.160 --> 01:10.560
As someone with two left feet.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.920
- Oh!

01:12.000 --> 01:13.560
Tapped any away?

01:13.560 --> 01:15.480
Oh. So many to choose from.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.840
You really think
Buradeena's the answer?

01:17.880 --> 01:20.280
For now. For Ruby. Yes.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.400
Well, selfish Donna
hopes that time

01:22.440 --> 01:24.160
brings all three of you back.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.640
I've missed the old Rafters.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.720
Well, the old Rafters have gone.
They drove off six years ago.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.520
Trouble is we settled and we...
never settled the details.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.040
But you definitely see a future
as you AND Dave?

01:38.080 --> 01:41.520
Yeah. In some form.
Just not sure what.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.400
Cool-down time.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.920
- Shuffle-hop-spring, girls!

01:46.960 --> 01:50.160
Keeping up
the façade for Donna's sake.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.120
OK, let's get
those arms moving.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.840
Just taking them around.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.160
And reaching up. Beautiful.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.360
Enjoy.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.960
Oi, Mum came
to say goodbye

02:03.000 --> 02:05.320
and now she's being
dragged into tap class.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.440
You should shoot it.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.680
Yeah.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.280
You'll get a good,
'Quick sticks!' from Donna.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.280
OK, what's up?

02:14.320 --> 02:17.840
Looks like they're finishing up.
Watch my beer.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.000
He's, um,
not so carbonated today.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.440
He's fizz-free.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.680
Thank you so much
for the loan of the shoes.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.560
And you've got a regular
if I do come back.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.160
You did well.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.080
You better not
have been filming!

02:36.120 --> 02:38.320
No! See?!

02:38.360 --> 02:39.880
Can we talk?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.400
A farewell beverage
will be waiting.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.560
You know I wouldn't hurt Rubes.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.080
Not intentionally.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.720
There are a lot of sickos
out there.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.640
- Your audience, Carbo.
- Some of them.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.720
I just wanted to say sorry.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.840
And for mucking up
Observation Earth.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.760
I just wanted to help.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.360
And off doing your own thing.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.360
It's for fun.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.520
Connect with
your followers, fine.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.440
But try and connect with
something fine in them.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.800
Life's more than just
joke after joke, Carbo.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.480
They expect me to be stupid.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.840
The ads, merchandise.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.080
It brings in the bucks.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.200
You have the ear
of a million followers.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.080
Try to make a difference.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.680
Lecture done.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.240
You're right.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.000
I'm gonna call them on it,
even if I lose some.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.720
Were they worth
having if you do?

03:27.760 --> 03:29.200
True.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.640
Ben and Cassie are really
looking forward to Greece.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.360
Yeah, me and Retta too.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.120
You're a good friend.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.080
If it's too big for the car,

03:49.120 --> 03:50.560
I can make other arrangements.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.680
Oh, no...

03:52.720 --> 03:53.840
Julie!

03:53.880 --> 03:57.200
My favourite painting for my
favourite budding talent.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.760
To remind her to keep painting.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.800
I'll leave it here.
I'll be back.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.560
Or possibly not.
Thank you so much, Charles.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.160
We'll squeeze it in, somehow.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.960
It's too good for Buradeena.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.040
Ruby is not a fan
of us going back.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.200
Dad would come here
if we stuck it out.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.160
Mum's giving in.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.600
Consider matters
from another angle, Ruby.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.440
Drought, fire, mining.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.000
Country towns are the front line

04:25.040 --> 04:27.320
in the fight against
climate change.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.880
Shouldn't you be where you can
affect the most change? Hm?

04:32.640 --> 04:36.920
Think about it. And give
you-know-who a break.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.120
Please feel free to visit
anytime, Charles.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.080
Bringing my paints and easel.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.360
And don't you and Ben
be strangers.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.320
You're welcome to stay
for dinner.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.000
- I won't, but thank you.
- OK. Bye!

04:51.040 --> 04:52.360
- Bye!
- Bye!

04:52.440 --> 04:53.640
Au revoir.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.160
Oh, it's such a lovely gesture.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.320
And you're taking
me away from him.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.080
I'm taking you home
to Dad. And Paddo.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.360
Charles knows all, right?

05:02.440 --> 05:04.520
Yep.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.480
Thank you for
having us here so long.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.040
Oh, you kept us on our toes.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.240
There's time before dinner if...

05:15.320 --> 05:18.080
Ah, yeah, I should
follow through. Thanks.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.920
I'm thinking about it, OK?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.680
Good.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.040
What he said is sort of right.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.240
But there are more people here
to get the message.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.520
Well, possibly too many.
You're a breath in a gale here.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.520
You ARE the gale in Buradeena.
You might make more change.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.520
Don't you think it's run away
from you just a bit?

05:48.520 --> 05:50.920
It has got crazy, I guess.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.680
You need your feet
back on the ground.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.640
And you miss your dad,
don't you?

05:54.680 --> 05:55.840
Of course.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.920
He hasn't said because he's
wanted to give us free rein,

05:58.960 --> 06:01.400
but he misses us too.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.800
Maybe we can go and work on him

06:05.840 --> 06:07.600
and we can all move
back after a while.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.640
Well...

06:08.680 --> 06:10.560
There so much more
happening here.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.040
Make him, Mum, please!

06:12.080 --> 06:14.040
I can't make him do anything,
sweetheart.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.440
You can hope.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.080
Mm. Except I'm not sure
what I do hope for anymore.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.080
I thought I knew.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.240
Kids are meant to
be the confused ones.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.840
One stage of growing up
is realising

06:26.880 --> 06:29.280
that your parents are
just as vulnerable as you.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.240
I'd appreciate your support.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.760
You really are confused.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.000
I am.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.240
Well, I guess
I have missed Paddo.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.720
- Mm!
- And Rose. And Tara.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.680
There you go.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.840
Maybe Charles is right.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.040
Let's see, shall we?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.120
Can't hurt.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.920
Come here.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.720
You're a good girl.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.000
- Dinner's ready.
- Thanks.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.920
OK. Let's eat up.
We've got a big drive tomorrow.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.080
- After you.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.320
Driving to...what?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.760
In search of what?

07:15.640 --> 07:18.760
I'll run it by her
soon as she's home and settled.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.680
You'll know either way.
OK, thanks, Rach.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.640
How'd Eddie go? Kick a goal?

07:24.680 --> 07:27.440
The Socceroos have their
eye on him.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.320
- That Rach again?
- Yeah.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.200
Three in a day? I thought
Observation Earth was done.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.160
It is.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.120
Is it the baby?
Is everything OK?

07:38.160 --> 07:39.560
Yeah. Yeah.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
- Nothing serious?
- It shouldn't be.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.160
OK, but I'm the one
telling your mother.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.000
Don't tell your brother, either.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.920
Nearly there.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.600
But I'm not.
Not even close.

08:12.640 --> 08:17.000
All I know is small changes
aren't going to cut it.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.760
Ruby! Ruby!

08:24.800 --> 08:26.520
Ha-ha! THAT'S a welcome!

08:26.560 --> 08:28.120
- Hi, Rubes!
- Hi!

08:28.160 --> 08:29.760
Hi, darling. Mwah!

08:31.720 --> 08:33.320
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.320
Hey, Rubes.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.960
Hey.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.880
Are we good?

08:53.160 --> 08:55.840
We're good. Are you good?

08:55.880 --> 08:57.840
I'm still a bit sore.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.720
I'm proud of my girl.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.640
'A lot of crap about crap?'

09:03.640 --> 09:06.760
Really, Dad?
Most kids would hold a grudge.

09:06.760 --> 09:07.880
You're not most kids.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.360
Believe it.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.600
OK?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.880
Fine.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.280
Go on inside.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.080
Hey, you've come back!

09:29.120 --> 09:31.040
Not the big one.
Here, take this one.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.040
I'll take the big one.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.000
Then out of the blue
that night...

09:40.040 --> 09:42.200
How does it feel?

09:42.240 --> 09:44.960
- Being back?
- Yeah.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.320
A bit strange.

09:54.120 --> 09:58.240
Look, I want to run
something by you.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.840
Old patterns can creep in
after 35 years,

10:01.880 --> 10:04.120
so maybe you need
to really break them

10:04.160 --> 10:06.160
to try and figure out new ones.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.640
You get right away.

10:09.640 --> 10:14.640
So why don't you fly over
and see Rach?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.760
Be there for the birth?
Take as long as you need after?

10:17.840 --> 10:20.520
I know you'd love to.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.040
New York?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.320
Help her.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.040
And think your feelings through
free from the day-to-day.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.760
I'm only just back.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.280
Easy enough to pack again.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.960
Well, what about Ruby?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.040
She and I could do with some
one-on-one time.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.160
Ben and Cassie can
take care of Ted.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.600
They're going to Greece.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.280
Not for a while. Not for long.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.040
Your choice.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.360
What do you say?

10:46.640 --> 10:49.200
I can't just land on Rachel...

10:49.240 --> 10:51.520
I mean, we spoke last
time I was here

10:51.600 --> 10:53.960
about my...
tendency to take over.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.240
I'd have to ask.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.440
I have.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.280
She's slept on it,
I didn't pressure her.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.400
And she's good to go. More than.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.400
She said that?

11:03.440 --> 11:05.560
She actually thought
of asking you herself

11:05.600 --> 11:06.640
since she's been back

11:06.680 --> 11:09.080
but she didn't want to
complicate things for us.

11:09.120 --> 11:12.160
- And would it?
- Only if we let it.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.480
You're not pushing me away?

11:15.520 --> 11:18.160
No. I want you to take
the opportunity.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.480
Take as much time
as you need.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.160
Not many husbands
would offer that.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.600
I just want to see
you truly smile again.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.240
Oh.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.400
What is with him, Nathan?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.040
When he's just got Mum home!

11:41.080 --> 11:42.760
He's not making any sense.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.280
We should talk to
both of them together.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.480
If we can't say it, who can?

11:50.520 --> 11:52.560
I've got an idea.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.960
Hey, keep Saturday free.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.120
I'll let you know when it's
all sorted. OK, ciao. Bye.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.160
Hey, can you cover my
shifts on the weekend?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.240
- Uh, sure. Why?
- It's an emergency. Buradeena.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.800
- Your dad?
- No, no, no he's fine.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.200
Well, his health is.
He's just got this crazy notion...

12:06.240 --> 12:07.400
That was Nathan.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.640
- How's he?
- He's good. Settling in.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.200
You care?

12:12.240 --> 12:16.080
His apology was sweet, yeah.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.240
Oh.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.560
Colour me inconsistent.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.760
And change the roster.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.600
Thank you.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.880
Tessa, Ben Rafter.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.520
You up for doing me a favour?

12:40.240 --> 12:41.880
Mm. I dropped off waiting.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.920
Sh! No need to wake.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.960
I am now.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.880
I've had an idea.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.640
Sounds promising.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.680
Of how to help
Mum and Dad, maybe.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.240
I've got a better one.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.320
I can't believe Dad. Talk about
shooting yourself in the foot.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.000
Later.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.880
I guess it can wait.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.960
It can.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.560
Going around in circles
was appropriate.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.440
Was rushing off to Rachel
just avoidance?

13:46.480 --> 13:48.720
Still using the kids
as an excuse?

13:48.760 --> 13:53.360
And was Dave
doing the same thing?

13:57.640 --> 13:58.880
Where is everyone?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.000
Hey, sleepyhead.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.920
Mum and Nathan,
walking meditation.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.640
Whatever that is.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.040
Paddo - no idea.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.560
- OK if I go see Tara?
- Sure.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.200
I thought you were
giving that up.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.360
I'm just tidying it up to sell.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.520
Sometimes life
delivers a message.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.320
Which is?

14:18.360 --> 14:20.400
'Quit while you're alive.'

14:22.000 --> 14:24.320
Well, what will you do now?

14:24.360 --> 14:26.480
Something that doesn't
risk being impaled.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.240
Makes sense.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.560
I'm glad you didn't die.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.800
I reckon I'm gladder.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.040
It means you'll have time.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.080
- For what?
- Joining me on the line.

14:45.360 --> 14:50.640
Next climate protest! Go, Dad!
Uh-huh. Go, Daddy. Who's a dad?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.200
- Come here!
- Argh! Dad!

14:55.480 --> 14:59.040
Meditate not medicate.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.760
And way more
peaceful than tap therapy.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.120
Any answers?

15:03.160 --> 15:04.800
Nothing concrete. You?

15:04.840 --> 15:06.960
I think the job is enough
of an answer for me.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.040
Yeah.

15:08.080 --> 15:12.360
So... Rach.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.160
I told you, she's excited.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.880
No. I mean,
how are you about it?

15:18.920 --> 15:21.480
I think she needs me.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.920
I don't want to sound
insensitive but does she really?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.240
It was nearly eight months

15:26.280 --> 15:28.080
before we even knew
she was pregnant.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.520
She'll have it all sorted out.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.000
It's easy to not feel vulnerable
when it's abstract.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.280
But it's about to get very real
for her and I will be there.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.560
OK.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.280
I'll be gone a few months
at the most.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.440
A few months?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.200
Well, if she needs me
that long, yes.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.320
What if you find what
you're looking for there?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.320
In New York?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.360
- Yeah!
- Oh, please.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.000
It's a big town
with a lot to offer.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.800
If...if you did, are you sure
you're going just for Rachel?

15:56.320 --> 16:00.800
We can talk about it...
at the picnic.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.920
Picnic?

16:02.960 --> 16:03.960
What picnic?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.760
All of us together, even Dad.
Ben's idea.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.360
Nathan's hinted
there'll be speeches.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.360
About what?

16:11.400 --> 16:16.760
You, me. Us. New York worries
them when I'm only just home.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.480
I mean, I'm meant to
be settling in.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.520
- It's none of their business.
- They disagree.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.680
You realise
we've reached that age.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.120
When the kids start telling us
how to beehive.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.360
We're not that old.
That's...old.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.400
Yeah. We're there.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.000
Bring on the walking frames.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.640
Up yours, Greta Dagberg.

16:41.680 --> 16:42.960
Shove a lump of coal in it.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.240
Don't mess with me, dag-head.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.480
Go, Rubes.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.800
We need an
environment club at school

16:50.840 --> 16:52.720
to turn around deniers like him.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.720
- Yeah.
- We could put out a newspaper.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.160
Old Spade won't let you.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.320
I'll work on her. You in?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.040
If Rose is, sure.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.520
Hey, Rubes. Wrap it up.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.280
Change of plan.

17:09.160 --> 17:13.680
- 31...
- How you doing, Grandad?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.720
41.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.800
43, 47...

17:18.800 --> 17:20.800
- Strange.
- Prime numbers.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.920
If you can't pee,
it never fails.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.240
I've never made it past 51.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.400
No, strange that he
can't remember yesterday

17:26.440 --> 17:27.720
but he knows the primes.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.240
Some things stick, I guess.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.480
Where we going again?

17:30.520 --> 17:31.560
Buradeena.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.080
A family picnic.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.800
Huh. A bloke
wouldn't want to miss that.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.080
We'll have really lost him when
the long-term memories fade.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.960
A bit like Mum.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.040
Hm?

17:47.080 --> 17:48.760
If whatever she's going through

17:48.800 --> 17:50.640
means that the
good times fade...

17:50.680 --> 17:53.000
So today is a reminder, then?

17:53.040 --> 17:54.200
A gentle nudge.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.400
Not just for her.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.000
Dad might need a wake-up too.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.000
Very mysterious.

18:01.040 --> 18:05.240
If you say it, you jinx it.
I'll tell you if it happens.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.200
I'm superstitious!

18:07.240 --> 18:09.640
Better out than in,
I always say.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.160
Let's go.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.080
I know what I'm doing.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.480
I hope.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.560
Look at this!

18:33.560 --> 18:35.760
Ah, beautiful.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.560
There you go, darling.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.880
Oh, thank you. What about
the coffee shop?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.320
Oh, that's all sorted.
Do you think I'd miss this?

18:43.320 --> 18:46.280
There are things to make up for.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.680
No, there aren't.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.400
I overstepped the mark.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.040
You helped.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.040
As long as I did.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.200
You did. We're fine.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.240
OK.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.800
All plates and utensils are
eco-friendly, Rubes.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.760
Good one.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.680
Hang on. Are you two
back together again?

19:07.720 --> 19:11.320
They are. I saw them kiss.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.760
- Sprung.
- Since when?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.280
A little while.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.760
I go away
and look what happens.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.680
Can we talk about something
else, please?

19:17.720 --> 19:18.920
Hi.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.320
Oh, look! Saved by the bell.
Gang's all here.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.800
We're getting them warmed up.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.400
Hi, Dad.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.080
Hey.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.000
Where's Cassie?

19:31.040 --> 19:33.680
She's taking a call.
I'll let her tell you.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.040
Right. How was the drive?

19:36.080 --> 19:38.000
We had an easy run,
didn't we, Grandad?

19:38.040 --> 19:40.160
Only had to stop
for one whizz.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.320
OK.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.440
Don't see why a whizz is funny.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.240
Come and get a beer, Ted.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.160
Won't say no.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.240
Whatever the reason,
this is lovely.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.000
Well, marriage counselling
made me realise

19:59.040 --> 20:01.320
how getting things out helps.

20:01.320 --> 20:05.160
And we're worried about you.
Both of you.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.560
You can say no.
It's just a picnic.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.320
But there are things
we'd like to say.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.320
Well, then I'd like to hear,
as long as your dad does.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.880
But bear in mind I have decided
to visit Rachel.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.560
Fair enough.
It's still worth hearing us out.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.400
You're making me
nervous, you two.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.320
- Let's just see how we go.
- OK.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.080
Alright, come and get it.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.920
Let's P-A-R-T why?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.400
Why? Because this
is a picnic.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.480
Yeah!

20:46.240 --> 20:48.800
- What smells funny?
- What?

20:48.800 --> 20:51.560
Clown poo. You know it!

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
I remember that one.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.000
You're drinking a lot of that
stuff there, mate.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.800
Aww!

20:58.800 --> 21:00.800
- Hello?
- Pardon me.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.480
Better out than in.
That's the girl.

21:02.520 --> 21:06.160
OK, why don't we just use that
as a Rafter punctuation mark

21:06.200 --> 21:09.200
because this is a picnic
with a purpose, right?

21:09.240 --> 21:10.680
Mm-hm.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.800
The old saying 'first
the laughter, then the tears'

21:14.880 --> 21:16.080
never truer.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.680
OK, this is adult stuff.
Eddie, Ruby... Sorry, Tess.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.680
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.520
You can stay if you want, mate,
but it's not really for kids.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.880
Ruby, coming?

21:29.920 --> 21:33.240
Let me say something first,
then I'll be with you.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.920
- Alright.
- Come on, mate.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.680
Thank you. Thanks.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.560
OK. The last few weeks

21:42.560 --> 21:46.560
you've all make me see that
adults are just grown-up kids.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.800
Which is good. Because it takes
some of the pressure off.

21:50.880 --> 21:55.240
I never really have to grow up.
I know what I want.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.360
But whatever makes you happiest.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.480
I'll leave you to get heavy.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.800
Thanks, darling.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.840
Oh. I'd be up for New York.
Think about it.

22:11.480 --> 22:14.400
- OK, what about you, Grandad?
- I'm not a kid.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.920
I'll say my part,
if that's OK?

22:17.960 --> 22:21.200
As you all know,
I first met these guys

22:21.240 --> 22:24.160
not long after
they came to town.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.200
There were these two notices

22:26.240 --> 22:29.840
with a little tear-off bit
in Tessa's café.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.240
One was an apprentice sparkie.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.560
With the long list
of 'must-bes',

22:34.600 --> 22:37.960
'Must be a good problem-solver'
was one of them.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.400
And I remember thinking,
'Yeah, OK, I think I am.'

22:42.440 --> 22:44.680
And then the other notice was,

22:44.720 --> 22:47.800
'Dave and Julie's
garden flat to rent.'

22:49.320 --> 22:50.600
So it was meant to be.

22:52.760 --> 22:58.560
And day one, I just thought you
guys were the coolest couple.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.960
Perfect couple.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.960
And I hope it stays that way.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.960
Hashtag couple goals.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.480
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks, Paddo.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.240
OK, who's next?

23:13.360 --> 23:15.840
I'm not blind
on my good days.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.040
But you don't have
to worry about me, love.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.880
Or your mother.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.320
We've got each other.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.960
So you do what's right for you.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.080
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Ted.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.200
OK, um...

23:43.640 --> 23:46.840
Whatever I've lost lately
whatever I'm going to lose,

23:46.880 --> 23:49.200
there's something
that I can never lose.

23:49.240 --> 23:52.160
Something you both gave me.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.720
It's my inner Rafter.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.440
The thing that will see me
through the changes up ahead

23:57.480 --> 24:00.240
and I hope it will see
you both yours.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.080
And I hope it
will bring you back.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.160
Hard acts to follow.

24:08.200 --> 24:14.320
Um, I just came up here to say
you're only just home. Don't go.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.960
But that's pretty selfish.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.760
And Dad seems fine with it,
so scrap that speech.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.640
Instead...

24:23.560 --> 24:27.720
However it turns out,
we'll understand

24:27.760 --> 24:29.640
'cause we love you
too much not to.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.640
But we know what we hope.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.040
It's hard to see you
ever not together.

24:37.840 --> 24:41.280
And I guess that sums it up.
That word.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.600
'Together'.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.240
Only way to go, right, Dad?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.280
I think I get your point, son.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.760
Cassie?

24:55.800 --> 24:57.080
Is now OK?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.600
- Let's do it.
- OK.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.440
This is not about you.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.640
It's about us.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.280
We are going to adopt.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.760
Oh!

25:09.800 --> 25:11.200
We're starting the process.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.000
We're on the hunt
for a new Rafter.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.000
Took me a little while
to catch on

25:15.040 --> 25:17.160
but we're more
together than ever.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.560
Oh, my darlings! Oh!

25:20.600 --> 25:23.040
That's so great.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.840
Oh, Julie.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.760
You can stop
with the 'togethers'.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.280
Message received. Not subtle.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.760
It wasn't meant to be.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.360
This is a celebration!
I'll get the champagne.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.920
First the laughter,
then the tears...of happiness.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.080
There was a lot
of well-intentioned

25:50.120 --> 25:51.800
emotional blackmail there today.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.760
Yes, there was.
As touching as it was.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.920
And it was. Ben's right.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.920
The way forward is together.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.600
We shouldn't be apart.

26:01.640 --> 26:06.400
Well, Ben might've been pushing
that but...we agreed I should go.

26:06.440 --> 26:10.240
He wasn't saying you should
stay. He was saying I should go.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.120
To New York.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.080
What?

26:14.120 --> 26:16.080
We both got patterns
we need to break.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.760
I'm not forcing it on you.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.560
Uh... What about Ruby?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.640
We could take her.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.160
What about school?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.800
We could take her work with us.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.040
It's up to you whether you
want us there or not.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.640
Maybe our being there will spoil
how you see it all going.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.480
But you're happy in Buradeena.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.680
Doesn't mean I have
to be a stick-in-the-mud.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.960
What I'm saying is that we can
both be there for Rach

26:43.000 --> 26:46.160
and you can come home
when you want to.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.560
Let's see where it takes us.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.600
And not
a moment too soon.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.680
Her waters broke as
we walked out the arrivals gate.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.080
Breathe. Just breathe.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.680
Do you want some water?

27:10.720 --> 27:11.800
- No.
- No.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.080
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:13.120 --> 27:16.880
No. I don't know. I don't know.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.760
You're doing so well,
sweetheart.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.600
I'm so glad you're here.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.560
As if I'd be anywhere else.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.720
I'm so happy I'm not... I'm not...

27:25.760 --> 27:27.760
No, you're not.
Whatever it is, you're not.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.000
Alone. Not alone.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.560
And Dad. I'm so happy.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.760
- It means the world to us too.
- You need to find your purpose.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.680
Yeah, well, maybe not right now.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.920
No, trust me.
Pain makes you wise.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.600
Your purpose. OK?
But don't lose Dad to find it.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.800
OK.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.760
I'm feeling very wise.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.600
OK, Rachel.
It's time to check you again.

27:52.640 --> 27:53.640
Is that OK?

27:58.320 --> 28:01.200
Oh, come on, sweetheart.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.400
Hey. You should sleep.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.560
I can arrange a bed for her.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.480
Rubes?

28:14.520 --> 28:18.800
It's 15 hours.
It has to be soon.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.280
I've known a lot longer.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.120
Put your head down if you can.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.400
I can here, thanks.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.040
She'll be right.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.600
That's so Crocodile Dundee.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.880
That's not a knife,
this is a knife.

28:30.920 --> 28:34.680
You just made my day.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.440
Lame, Dad.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.760
And proud of it.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.560
That's it.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.320
Can we stop this now?
This can't be normal.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.480
I never even
really wanted a baby.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.520
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.640
There has to be
a more efficient way to do this.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.440
OK, and again, push. Push.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.440
- I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.040
That's it. That's it.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.080
Perfect. Good girl.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.680
She is almost here. OK?
Just hold it there.

29:15.720 --> 29:16.680
Hold?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.320
It's normal. That's normal,
sweetheart. That's normal.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.960
Rachel, Rachel,
I can just see her hair.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.040
Mum!

29:24.760 --> 29:27.640
Control now.
Just tiny little pushes.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.640
And breathe.

29:28.680 --> 29:31.200
Breathe. Breathe.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.800
That's perfect. Her head is out.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.720
Her shoulders will come out
and one big push.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.160
Ready? Push. Push!

29:42.520 --> 29:44.160
She's here!

29:44.200 --> 29:45.560
You're all done.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.200
Is she alright?

29:47.240 --> 29:49.080
Welcome to the world,
little one.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.000
- Is she OK?
- It's alright. It's alright.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.200
She is perfect.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.160
Here she is.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.640
Hello, gorgeous girl.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.040
Say hello, Grandma.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.120
Pinch me, Linda.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.200
Who?

30:12.240 --> 30:13.600
It's a long story.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.720
Pinch me very hard.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.240
Amazing.

30:34.320 --> 30:38.280
You should see her.
She's beautiful.

30:40.440 --> 30:44.760
Uh! Not yet. Not yet.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.080
Our daughter has a baby.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.720
Our daughter.

30:56.760 --> 31:01.840
Whatever our problems,
we will solve them together.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.520
And I will find my purpose.

31:05.560 --> 31:08.080
With you.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.680
Because I love you, Dave Rafter.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.800
There's that smile.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.160
There it is.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.360
I've missed you.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.760
So column H is
what we're left with each week.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.200
You're right. There's way too
much waste of produce.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.280
Let's find a balance

31:50.320 --> 31:52.800
between cutting back orders
and not limiting the menu.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.320
Sounds good.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.560
Excuse me. I've gotta take this.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.120
Dad?

32:04.360 --> 32:07.280
Go, Rach!

32:07.320 --> 32:08.560
I'm an uncle!

32:09.400 --> 32:10.840
Yes!

32:11.680 --> 32:14.320
Got some good news
to tell you, Grandad.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.160
Oh, yeah?

32:16.200 --> 32:19.080
There is another Rafter
in the world.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.640
- Boy or girl?
- A girl.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.760
Better luck next time.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.560
You can't say that, Grandad.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.320
Daughters. You've got
to pay for the wedding.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.360
Mind you, we wouldn't
be without our Julie for quids.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.600
Grandad's in un-PC mode.

32:33.640 --> 32:39.160
Ooh. Oh. Two. Two, three...

32:39.200 --> 32:42.000
Hold it, Grandad.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.160
Seven, 11.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.800
Stop counting till we get to
the loo. Come on.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.760
13, 17, 19.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.360
Come on.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.160
What comes after 19?

32:53.480 --> 32:56.040
19.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.960
I'll tell you when we get there.
Come on.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.040
19!

33:15.000 --> 33:17.240
She's beautiful.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.840
That's not a baby,
this is a baby.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.280
Private joke.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.920
We should go.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.600
Yeah, we'll let you
get some sleep.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.040
Couldn't have
done it without you.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.760
Ah, well,
we make a great team.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.160
We do.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.240
Sorry, I lost sight
of that for a while.

33:40.280 --> 33:44.080
Well, next time, if there is
one, as soon as you know, we do.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.400
Promise.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.760
There will be hell to pay
if you don't, I reckon.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.160
Rest up.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.760
What do you think, Rubes?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.040
OK, I guess.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.880
Don't sound too excited.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.800
She's cute.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.680
Later.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.880
She's hardly slept.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.400
Who is Linda?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.640
When I was in India
at the Taj Mahal,

34:15.680 --> 34:18.680
you have to go through
this gate to see it.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.960
You walk in
and the postcard view,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.640
it just hits you, you know? Pow.

34:23.640 --> 34:28.640
And so I'm standing there and
I hear this voice behind me...

34:28.640 --> 34:33.640
'Oh, my god, pinch me,
Linda. I'm really here.'

34:33.680 --> 34:36.960
This rather loud
tourist in a tie-dyed T-shirt

34:37.000 --> 34:38.640
talking to her friend.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.200
Pinch me, Linda.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.960
Never heard a better reaction
to the wonder of life.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.080
That says it all.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.480
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.440
I'm really here.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.280
Cigar, Unkie Nathan?

35:11.320 --> 35:12.960
Best I could find in Buradeena.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.440
Actually the only one.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.400
Thanks!
Hey, Mum says she's cute as.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.040
She doesn't
take after you, then.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.160
- Lucky girl.
- Reckon.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.840
The clan expands!

35:23.880 --> 35:25.400
Congratulations.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.440
Thanks, Tess.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.320
- What do you think, Eddie?
- I hope they bring her back!

35:29.360 --> 35:30.880
Do ya? I reckon they will.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.480
Check her out! Check her out!

35:34.600 --> 35:36.640
She so cute!

35:36.680 --> 35:39.760
Every cynic melts
when they see a newborn.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.040
You're no cynic.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.520
Catch me on a bad day.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.640
She is just beautiful.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.840
Send them a cyber hug from me,
won't you?

35:47.880 --> 35:50.600
Yeah, will do.
Come on, buddy.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.840
You should send that
to Uncle Ben.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.600
Yes!

36:08.160 --> 36:11.960
It's Mum. Don't hang up.
It's been so long.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.080
A friend of mine's daughter just
had a baby and I was thinking...

36:16.120 --> 36:17.520
I thought...

36:19.640 --> 36:23.480
Hello? Hello?

36:32.800 --> 36:34.400
Us? Godparents?

36:34.440 --> 36:35.440
Yes.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.600
- We're here and you're there.
- I'll be coming home more.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.920
Definitely for the christening.
I'll make sure she knows you.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.760
We're still trying to get our
heads around the parent thing.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.120
I've seen you
with Ruby and with Edward.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.600
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather trust Louise with.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.840
Louise?!

36:51.880 --> 36:52.880
Aww, cute.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.440
She has Grandma's eyes.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.840
Grandad will be chuffed.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.600
So will I, if you accept.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.160
We would love to.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.440
Yeah?

37:01.480 --> 37:05.160
Uh, yeah! Of course.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.000
Does this definitely mean
I'm the golden-haired child?

37:08.040 --> 37:10.360
I happily relinquish the crown.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.000
Thank you.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.680
Our absolute pleasure.

37:14.760 --> 37:18.120
- Later.
- Bye.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.600
Hey. Still can't sleep?

37:38.120 --> 37:39.520
No.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.160
Can I get you anything?
Hot milk?

37:41.160 --> 37:42.640
No.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.200
Let me know if there is.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.560
Why do people keep acting
like it's the best thing?

37:51.320 --> 37:52.600
- What?
- Babies.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.560
Look at what she's coming into.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.160
Oh! Honey, a whole lot of love.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.200
I mean the world.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.760
Well, but where would we be if
everyone thought like that?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.040
Better off, maybe.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.480
Overpopulation
is one of the problems.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.800
Yeah, but the answer
is not to stop having babies.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.760
What is, then?
No one seems to know.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.080
Darling, maybe stop reading
some of the grimmer articles.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.000
That's just burying
my head in the sand.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.960
Yes, but if they upset you,
sweetheart...

38:21.000 --> 38:22.080
We should ALL be upset!

38:23.960 --> 38:27.360
I'm scared. Everyone should be.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.480
Well, we'll just
have to try harder.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.920
But will we?

38:31.960 --> 38:34.560
Well, you will. We will.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.360
- Will you?
- Of course I will.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.480
Promise?

38:38.520 --> 38:43.040
And it struck me.
Just like that.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.440
Yes. I do.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.760
Too many channels.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.280
What's news?

38:56.320 --> 38:59.000
Uh, research.

38:59.040 --> 39:03.760
I've had a left-of-field
thought. Way left.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.320
About what?

39:07.440 --> 39:08.640
How to keep a promise.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.520
How to have a purpose.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.440
It's amazing how
the small moments

39:18.480 --> 39:20.440
can suddenly come together

39:20.480 --> 39:22.840
to guide you to something huge.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.680
Doggie-do art.

39:28.520 --> 39:31.920
My first enviro-militant act.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.120
Old attitudes
to women and education.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.040
'Typing, shorthand, and home
economics is all a girl needs,'

39:40.080 --> 39:42.360
so said Mum, bless her.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.320
I do envy your generation.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.280
Thanks.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.640
And an insight
from your daughter.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.600
You need to find your purpose.

39:53.640 --> 39:58.680
And all the pieces of
the puzzle clicked into place.

40:01.840 --> 40:06.080
Nine months, a bridging course,
and one christening later,

40:06.120 --> 40:08.640
starting my degree
in sustainability.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.280
Pinch me, Linda.
I'm really here.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.840
Off on my three-year journey.

40:15.080 --> 40:19.320
The answer it's all been leading
to. Who would've guessed?

40:19.360 --> 40:22.880
So excited. So terrified.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.560
And with Dave's total support.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.920
It was there at the start
of our last big journey.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.200
Road trip of the mind.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.360
That's so sweet.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.440
And so sentimental.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.640
Nothing wrong with sentimental.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.560
Nothing.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.920
The christening proved that.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.880
A sea of sentiment.

40:59.920 --> 41:04.640
Rachel loving her daughter.
Loved as a daughter even more.

41:04.680 --> 41:09.000
In pride of place,
a Ruby Rafter original.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.520
There's no stopping her

41:10.560 --> 41:13.160
since our many visits
to the Guggenheim.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.320
Title - 'Louise'.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.320
Dad's pleased, we think.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.040
We hope.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.680
He's slipping.

41:23.760 --> 41:29.040
The next wedding, Dave's
best man - proud as punch.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.760
My two besties
have hit it off.

41:34.800 --> 41:38.640
Ben calls us
the Three Musky Dears.

41:38.680 --> 41:42.280
Nathan's inner Rafter
is seeing him through.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.640
He's been needing it.

41:48.080 --> 41:51.040
I’m not sure what’s happening
with Nathan and Anna.

41:51.080 --> 41:53.280
Eddie hopes he does.

41:53.320 --> 41:56.680
Anna’s here
to support the godparents.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.160
Ben and Cassie
wanting to make a difference.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.920
Adoption became fostering.

42:03.960 --> 42:08.440
Off to a rocky start - Garth.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.440
Carbo’s been using his
streaming for the greater good,

42:12.480 --> 42:15.000
and doubled his
followers in the process.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.280
So there we were.

42:17.320 --> 42:20.440
All of us together
to name the newest Rafter.

42:20.480 --> 42:24.080
Our crowd. Birds of a feather.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.960
Welcome, as we gather to baptise

42:27.000 --> 42:29.640
Louise Julie Rafter
into the fellowship of Christ.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.000
Before we commence, let us pray.

42:32.040 --> 42:35.480
For a world
worthy of the children.

43:02.440 --> 43:05.560
Look at me, Mum. I’m at Uni.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.560
Watch out, grandma!

43:11.160 --> 43:15.160
Not that it won’t
come without challenges.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.680
But that’s another story.
