WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:02.817
(rhythmic music playing)

00:02.895 --> 00:05.421
(indistinct chatter)

00:09.068 --> 00:11.260
(eerie music)

00:15.591 --> 00:17.499
- I'm with the FBI.
We're looking for this man.

00:17.576 --> 00:19.334
Has he come in here?
- I don't think so.

00:19.411 --> 00:21.503
- Look again. Be certain.

00:21.580 --> 00:24.398
He has a gun.
He's already used it tonight.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.603
- No, he hasn't come in.

00:29.755 --> 00:30.678
Are we in danger?

00:30.865 --> 00:33.848
Should I call someone?
- I'm already here.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.351
Any rooms in the back?
Places he could be hiding?

00:36.428 --> 00:39.997
- This is it.
The bathrooms, I guess.

00:42.692 --> 00:45.952
- I'm with the FBI.
Have you seen this man?

00:46.105 --> 00:47.713
Gentlemen,
have you seen this man?

00:47.790 --> 00:49.106
FBI, excuse me.

00:49.124 --> 00:51.608
Have you seen this man?

00:51.610 --> 00:53.093
(eerie music)

01:03.898 --> 01:06.714
(groaning)

01:06.734 --> 01:08.308
Anything?
<i> - Exit's secure.</i>

01:08.385 --> 01:10.127
<i>Fennessey hasn't left the hotel.</i>

01:10.129 --> 01:11.219
<i> Time for another sweep?</i>

01:11.297 --> 01:13.980
- I can't linger.
I've been shot.

01:14.057 --> 01:16.658
Bourbon. Neat. Top shelf.

01:21.398 --> 01:23.499
It's all right.
You're safe.

01:25.494 --> 01:26.752
He's not here.

01:29.832 --> 01:31.548
(sighing)

01:41.493 --> 01:44.103
(dramatic music)

02:00.362 --> 02:02.287
- Tell us again.
- There's nothing more to tell.

02:02.364 --> 02:04.030
- There must be.
Because what you told us

02:04.183 --> 02:05.607
last night makes absolutely
no sense.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.685
- But it does make sense.
Keith wasn't kidnapped.

02:08.687 --> 02:11.797
He died.
Because of me.

02:11.948 --> 02:14.091
(soft music)

02:17.212 --> 02:20.213
Evie was having a party,

02:20.215 --> 02:22.366
and so, Quinn and I snuck out,

02:22.368 --> 02:24.701
and we went across the lake.

02:24.703 --> 02:28.981
It was a cold winter.
The ice, it seemed solid.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.649
We were halfway across
when we realized

02:30.800 --> 02:32.484
that Keith was following us.

02:32.711 --> 02:36.321
I told him to go home,
but he refused.

02:36.398 --> 02:38.157
I pushed him.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.550
He slipped and the ice cracked.

02:40.552 --> 02:41.827
(screaming)
Then he fell.

02:41.904 --> 02:44.237
We couldn't get to him.

02:44.314 --> 02:46.390
- Sid!

02:46.408 --> 02:48.392
- We called out
and we screamed,

02:48.410 --> 02:49.484
but everything happened so fast.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.628
One moment, he was there
and the next...

02:54.491 --> 02:57.234
...it was silent.

02:57.236 --> 02:58.326
I didn't tell you guys

02:58.345 --> 03:00.012
because I thought
you'd abandon me.

03:00.163 --> 03:02.330
Or put me into foster care
like my birth parents did.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.258
- Honey, we would never do that.
- I know that now.

03:05.335 --> 03:06.927
Just like I know
that Keith is dead.

03:07.003 --> 03:08.729
And that he is lying.

03:11.341 --> 03:13.508
- She's right.
I have lied.

03:13.585 --> 03:15.360
- About what?
About who you are?

03:15.512 --> 03:17.938
- No. Everything Sid said
is true.

03:18.090 --> 03:20.424
As far as it goes.

03:20.442 --> 03:22.350
But there was another
hole in the ice.

03:22.428 --> 03:24.203
I don't know how I found it,
but I did.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.263
I got to the road
and a car pulled over.

03:26.281 --> 03:29.616
I was freezing. I could feel
the heat from the open door.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.435
They offered me a ride home.

03:31.437 --> 03:34.195
I got in and I was... taken.

03:34.273 --> 03:36.048
I didn't lie about who I am.

03:36.199 --> 03:38.383
I lied about not wanting
to talk about it.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.478
I lied because I didn't want
to get Sidney in trouble.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.222
I didn't want you
to think it was her fault.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.057
- Keith, we don't think that.
- Keith?

03:45.133 --> 03:46.283
You believe him and not me?

03:46.301 --> 03:47.801
- We want to believe him,

03:47.953 --> 03:49.286
that he is our son,
that he is home.

03:49.304 --> 03:51.212
Your opinion--
- It's not opinion.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.622
The body in C's lab.

03:52.624 --> 03:54.307
The one that was pulled in
from the lake.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.959
I called it in.
I knew it was there.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.127
- You did that?
- Yes.

03:57.145 --> 03:58.386
Once C ID's it,

03:58.405 --> 03:59.813
you'll know once
and for all that

03:59.815 --> 04:01.298
he's an imposter.
- I'm your son.

04:01.316 --> 04:02.966
- Enough. We're gonna
figure this out right now.

04:02.968 --> 04:05.485
Get up. Let's go.

04:05.562 --> 04:07.412
- Shouldn't be long,
my friend...

04:07.489 --> 04:10.307
till we figure out
who you are.

04:10.309 --> 04:13.568
And we get you home.

04:13.645 --> 04:15.420
- This is ridiculous! You want
me to stay here with him?

04:15.572 --> 04:18.315
- Hey, I'm not the one accusing
you of being an imposter.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.150
- Enough. The questioning.
The uncertainty.

04:20.152 --> 04:21.318
It ends when C gives us
the answer.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.745
Until then, yes,
you stay here.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.298
- I feel like I'm under arrest.
- You're not under arrest.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.599
But this is a police station.

04:27.676 --> 04:31.019
So if you kill each other,
you'll be arrested.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.526
(alarm sounding)

04:43.692 --> 04:47.286
(speaking in Arabic)

04:47.437 --> 04:49.705
(alarm sounding)

04:53.627 --> 04:56.353
- Craig Fennessey is a friend.
Or he used to be.

04:56.355 --> 04:58.855
He was another kid that
George Lyle looked out for.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.465
- Wait, George Lyle.
Your George Lyle?

05:00.617 --> 05:02.208
- He's the one who
called in the alert.

05:02.361 --> 05:04.285
I know you and Jay
got a lot going on,

05:04.363 --> 05:05.879
so if you want me and Kemi
to handle it...

05:06.031 --> 05:07.455
- We do. Thank you
so much for saying that.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.474
Jay's checking in with C now.

05:09.626 --> 05:11.310
But I'm here.
And from what you've said,

05:11.495 --> 05:13.979
George is practically
family to you, so...

05:14.130 --> 05:16.206
(knocking)
- Hey, George.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.442
- You must be Miss Nikki.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.730
- It's so nice to
finally meet you.

05:23.807 --> 05:25.215
- You as well.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.400
Mike's words do not
do you justice.

05:27.553 --> 05:29.161
No, there have been artists
that have painted

05:29.312 --> 05:30.329
masterpieces of lesser women.

05:30.405 --> 05:32.556
I know I'm laying it on
a little thick.

05:32.558 --> 05:34.391
But at my age, I ain't
picking up anyone

05:34.393 --> 05:36.226
with my good looks.
- I don't know, George,

05:36.244 --> 05:38.319
I ain't heard
nothing but the truth.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.914
I'm sorry we're not meeting
under better circumstances.

05:41.066 --> 05:43.175
- I told her
Craig and I go way back.

05:43.326 --> 05:45.068
But we've lost touch.

05:45.087 --> 05:46.920
Why don't you tell us
what you know?

05:46.996 --> 05:48.680
- Well, I'm in charge
of port security.

05:48.832 --> 05:50.682
Craig works for me.
He's a lot like Mike.

05:50.759 --> 05:56.021
He's a good guy. Works hard.
Shows up to work on time.

05:56.098 --> 05:57.581
Except for the past few days.

05:57.599 --> 06:00.675
I tried his house,
his cellphone. Nothing.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.086
- You said you had concerns
about criminal activity

06:03.105 --> 06:04.846
at the port?
- After I left the force,

06:04.865 --> 06:07.090
I was hired to clean up
corruption.

06:07.109 --> 06:09.776
Now, for a while, I thought
I had it under control.

06:09.928 --> 06:11.761
Until recently...
You know when your sixth sense

06:11.855 --> 06:13.187
tells you something's up?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.765
I'm concerned that Craig
might have uncovered something

06:15.784 --> 06:17.042
that might have got him
in trouble

06:17.119 --> 06:19.285
with some very dangerous people.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.028
(bell on door ringing)

06:21.048 --> 06:22.631
(tense music)

06:39.307 --> 06:40.974
- We'll start at
Craig's apartment,

06:41.050 --> 06:42.067
and then work out from there.

06:42.218 --> 06:43.309
Nice to meet you.

06:43.462 --> 06:46.980
- Pleasure was all mine,
Miss Nikki.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.223
- You know I always liked Craig.

06:49.301 --> 06:50.575
I know he's like a son to you.

06:50.727 --> 06:52.469
Which means he's like
a brother to me.

06:52.487 --> 06:56.306
He needs help.
I'm not gonna let him down.

06:56.308 --> 06:58.500
- Knew I could
count on you, Mike.

07:03.482 --> 07:04.481
(sighing)

07:04.574 --> 07:06.833
- Your daughter thinks
this is your son?

07:06.985 --> 07:08.818
That's awkward.
- It is awkward.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.095
So if you put down
the art project

07:10.130 --> 07:11.412
and start running his DNA.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.080
- I can't because hydrolysis
in bones

07:13.100 --> 07:15.249
causes DNA molecules
to dissociate

07:15.269 --> 07:16.918
from the hydroxyapatite.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.103
- Those are very big words

07:18.180 --> 07:20.755
from a grownup who doodles.

07:20.832 --> 07:23.166
(scoffs)
- His DNA is damaged.

07:23.168 --> 07:25.001
I've run CAT SCANS, sonograms,

07:25.020 --> 07:26.594
racial and ethnic variables

07:26.613 --> 07:28.947
to try to give whoever this is
their identity back.

07:29.098 --> 07:30.282
As well as their dignity.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.843
Which I cannot do
without 2-D layering.

07:33.862 --> 07:36.437
- When's that happening?

07:36.515 --> 07:39.440
- In college,
I developed this app.

07:39.518 --> 07:40.700
DVR for radio.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.127
All the VCs wanted in.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.038
Meetings got set, I...

07:45.114 --> 07:46.706
didn't go to a single one.

07:46.858 --> 07:48.115
I stayed home.

07:48.193 --> 07:51.636
And I ate gummy worms.

07:51.713 --> 07:54.698
I do not handle pressure well,
Jason.

07:54.716 --> 07:56.141
It bloats me.
- I'm sorry.

07:56.292 --> 07:57.458
I'm sorry that
you're in this position.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.052
I'm sorry I made a comment
about doodling.

07:59.204 --> 08:00.553
But my ex-wife's happiness,

08:00.630 --> 08:03.148
my sanity and the future
of my children

08:03.299 --> 08:06.209
rests in what you find here.

08:06.211 --> 08:07.560
- I should have something
this afternoon.

08:07.713 --> 08:10.989
Or in four pounds.
Whatever happens first.

08:11.066 --> 08:14.451
(door opening)
- Craig?

08:19.649 --> 08:22.042
(distant sirens wailing)

08:34.422 --> 08:37.164
- I got nothing. You?
- Same.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.075
It doesn't surprise me, though.

08:39.094 --> 08:41.002
Who's this?
He looks familiar.

08:41.079 --> 08:43.079
He was always a loner.

08:43.098 --> 08:45.506
No wife. No kids.
Dad passed away.

08:45.584 --> 08:48.101
Mom's in a nursing home
that George pays for.

08:48.253 --> 08:49.586
- I like George.

08:49.604 --> 08:52.364
I like how much he likes you.
(chuckling)

08:59.873 --> 09:01.456
Bingo.

09:04.119 --> 09:06.711
Stacks of cash, fake IDs?

09:06.863 --> 09:09.714
Maybe you don't know Craig
as well as you think you do.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.370
(phone ringing)
- Maybe we're looking for

09:16.390 --> 09:18.890
somebody who doesn't
want to be found.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.375
- Hey. Anything from C?

09:21.395 --> 09:22.894
- Nothing yet. But I got
a hit on the alert,

09:22.971 --> 09:24.045
from a cab driver.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.730
<i> - He's sure that</i>
<i> it was Fennessey.</i>

09:25.807 --> 09:27.649
- 100%. Blood on the backseat.

09:30.128 --> 09:31.127
- How are the kids?

09:31.146 --> 09:32.887
- They are in their
neutral corners.

09:32.964 --> 09:34.147
For now.
<i> - And how are you?</i>

09:34.223 --> 09:36.057
- I'm having my eggs read.

09:36.134 --> 09:37.558
If that tells you anything.
- Shh.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.578
- Do you think it's possible
Keith is an imposter?

09:39.729 --> 09:42.155
- The Johnston Hotel.
That's where the cab driver

09:42.231 --> 09:43.230
<i> said he picked up Fennessey.</i>

09:43.250 --> 09:45.066
- Is it possible, Jay?

09:45.143 --> 09:47.752
- Yes. No. Maybe.
I don't know.

09:47.904 --> 09:49.254
I also don't know
what Kemi's doing.

09:49.331 --> 09:51.238
But I know I need her to do it.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.592
(distant sirens wailing)

09:55.596 --> 09:57.003
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.822
- Long time no see.
Mike Sherman,

09:58.840 --> 10:00.490
this is Jamie Lewis.
- Nice to meet you.

10:00.492 --> 10:02.342
- You on a case?
- We have a missing person

10:02.494 --> 10:04.269
that may have been a guest
at the hotel. You?

10:04.420 --> 10:05.829
- There was a shootout upstairs.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.180
We lost an agent.

10:07.332 --> 10:08.940
Assassin hid behind the bar.

10:09.092 --> 10:10.183
Bled all over the floor.

10:10.335 --> 10:12.352
- Our missing person
was bleeding.

10:12.504 --> 10:13.336
Craig Fennessey.

10:13.338 --> 10:14.520
- Craig Fennessey?
- Mm-hmm.

10:14.597 --> 10:16.506
- That's who was at
the hotel last night.

10:16.524 --> 10:18.283
- Looks like we're looking
for the same person.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.767
- Actually, Detective,
we're not.

10:19.861 --> 10:20.952
- Jamie.
- Sorry.

10:21.029 --> 10:22.120
It's above my pay grade.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.847
- What is? Why are you sorry?

10:23.849 --> 10:26.124
- It's a federal case.
She wants us to stand down.

10:26.201 --> 10:27.867
- Okay, yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

10:27.944 --> 10:30.036
- Craig Fennessey murdered
one of our agents.

10:30.188 --> 10:32.021
- Allegedly.
Even if he wasn't a friend,

10:32.040 --> 10:33.706
which he was, I think
we can both agree on that.

10:33.708 --> 10:36.468
- What we agree on or not
is of no interest to me.

10:36.619 --> 10:38.544
What is of interest
is finding Fennessey.

10:38.621 --> 10:42.048
Which we will be doing
and you will not.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.867
I'll send someone
to pick up your evidence.

10:43.885 --> 10:45.477
- Great.

10:47.205 --> 10:48.388
- This is nuts.
We're off the case?

10:48.540 --> 10:50.056
What am I supposed
to tell George?

10:50.133 --> 10:51.057
- How about that his protege

10:51.209 --> 10:53.026
might've murdered an FBI agent?

10:56.381 --> 10:58.323
- Yes, George, I understand
that this is very

10:58.400 --> 11:00.733
personal to you, and we are--

11:00.827 --> 11:03.662
(indistinct arguing)

11:03.813 --> 11:05.889
- Did we do something to you?

11:05.907 --> 11:06.998
To someone you love?

11:07.075 --> 11:08.983
- You didn't do anything.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.894
You are something.

11:10.912 --> 11:12.228
You're my family.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.746
- I don't know how you did it.

11:13.823 --> 11:15.899
The scar. The DNA.

11:15.917 --> 11:19.010
But the body in the lake?
Even you couldn't plan for that.

11:19.162 --> 11:20.762
- You know whose hair to use.

11:27.003 --> 11:29.245
- That body isn't your brother.

11:29.264 --> 11:31.022
I'm your brother.
- We'll find out.

11:31.174 --> 11:34.341
And if you're not...

11:34.343 --> 11:36.569
Dad might just beat you
to death.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.306
- I'm telling you
it's not possible.

11:40.383 --> 11:43.109
Craig killing
an FBI agent?! Why?

11:43.261 --> 11:44.318
What motive would he have?

11:44.429 --> 11:46.204
- Do you know
who Samuel Price is?

11:46.281 --> 11:47.597
- I've never heard of him.

11:47.599 --> 11:49.356
- Craig had some documents
in that name.

11:49.434 --> 11:50.709
A passport,
a driver's license...

11:50.860 --> 11:53.861
- Along with 100,000 dollars
in a box in his apartment.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.272
- Maybe he found out something
was happening at the port,

11:56.291 --> 11:57.698
maybe his life was threatened,

11:57.718 --> 12:00.276
and maybe he got scared,
and was setting up to get away.

12:00.295 --> 12:02.295
- Or he was setting up
to get away

12:02.371 --> 12:06.207
because he was getting ready
to kill an FBI agent.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.117
- Craig couldn't shoot
a cap gun,

12:08.136 --> 12:10.620
let alone a suppressor
with polymer tips.

12:10.622 --> 12:12.546
I'm telling you
he's being framed.

12:12.624 --> 12:15.049
- You're probably right.
But there's nothing we can do.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.960
- Because some field agent
spanked you?

12:16.962 --> 12:19.386
- No. Because a Special Agent
from the FBI

12:19.464 --> 12:23.299
exercised her right and folded
our case into hers.

12:23.301 --> 12:24.634
I texted you her number.

12:24.652 --> 12:26.911
I'm sure she'll be happy
to speak with you.

12:26.988 --> 12:28.246
(scoffs)
- I came to you

12:28.397 --> 12:32.992
because you're good.
But also because you're family.

12:33.069 --> 12:34.627
(scoffs)

12:40.260 --> 12:43.094
You know, I'm so disappointed
in you, son.

12:50.345 --> 12:51.511
- I can't believe
I'm not helping.

12:51.663 --> 12:54.421
- You're not.
But he is getting help.

12:54.423 --> 12:57.016
- What, from the FBI?
You heard Agent Lewis.

12:57.168 --> 12:58.351
She's so convinced
that Craig's guilty,

12:58.503 --> 12:59.852
she's ready to be the judge,
the jury,

12:59.929 --> 13:01.613
and if she gets the chance,
executioner.

13:01.764 --> 13:04.115
- Craig is a person of interest

13:04.192 --> 13:06.025
in the murder
of one of their agents.

13:06.102 --> 13:07.285
- And George is like
a father

13:07.436 --> 13:08.694
figure to me after
I lost my dad.

13:08.847 --> 13:11.122
- You never talk about
what happened to your father.

13:11.274 --> 13:13.291
I wish you would.
- You know the song.

13:13.442 --> 13:16.369
Crooked cop. Took payoffs.
Went to jail.

13:16.521 --> 13:19.539
Destroyed our family.
I was 15.

13:19.691 --> 13:22.358
Before that, he was my hero.
After, I never spoke to him.

13:22.377 --> 13:24.193
- And that's when
you met George.

13:24.195 --> 13:25.786
- They worked together.
Idolized him

13:25.806 --> 13:27.213
almost as much as I did.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.833
He took me under his wing.
Did the same thing for Craig.

13:30.835 --> 13:32.143
He saved my life, Nikki.

13:32.295 --> 13:33.553
The man never asked me
for anything.

13:33.705 --> 13:37.223
Now the one time he does,
I turn my back on him.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.692
- Craig Fennessey,
I think I know where he is.

13:42.397 --> 13:45.472
- No landscape to interpret.
Box store furniture.

13:45.567 --> 13:47.900
What am I looking at, Kemi?
- Nothing.

13:48.053 --> 13:49.385
- Then why are we looking at it?

13:49.478 --> 13:51.663
- Because people who look
like they have nothing to hide

13:51.739 --> 13:52.738
actually don't.

13:52.891 --> 13:55.074
I stare at these photos
all day long.

13:55.226 --> 13:57.001
A lot of them have
distinguishing features.

13:57.153 --> 13:59.062
Mountains. Nudity.
Nose picking.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.155
But a lot of them
are indistinguishable.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.157
And that's what people
like to post the most.

14:03.234 --> 14:04.509
Photos of nothing.

14:04.586 --> 14:06.252
And that's what I see
that you don't.

14:06.329 --> 14:08.571
That all of this nothing
means that there's

14:08.590 --> 14:10.515
actually nothing to hide.
Which is why a simple

14:10.666 --> 14:13.334
image search found
the exact same photo

14:13.336 --> 14:15.578
on a Dr. Scott Walker's
social media page.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.856
- Scott Walker?
That's Craig's childhood friend.

14:17.932 --> 14:20.341
- Well, Dr. Walker's photo
is geotagged.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.177
It is at a fishing cabin
that the good doctor owns

14:23.196 --> 14:25.846
near Pennypack Creek.
- So Craig's been there.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.348
What makes you think
he's there now?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.092
- Because an hour ago,
Samuel Price

14:29.094 --> 14:31.260
used his credit card at a store

14:31.279 --> 14:32.929
located two miles
from the cabin.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.098
- Craig's fake ID.
The one we found in the box.

14:35.116 --> 14:37.358
- The FBI took us off the case.
- I know.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.377
But I just read Jason's eggs,

14:39.454 --> 14:41.454
and it made me want
to spit at the gods.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.364
And the FBI felt like
the next best option.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.216
- They're positive
he killed one of their own.

14:45.368 --> 14:46.700
If we give them this,
they'll go in hot,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.444
looking for any reason to shoot.
If Craig is innocent,

14:48.446 --> 14:50.296
he deserves to be
brought in peacefully.

14:50.448 --> 14:52.131
- Fine. Kemi, go with Mike.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.224
(sighs)

14:53.301 --> 14:55.118
We bring him in,
we give him to the FBI.

14:55.136 --> 14:56.953
You understand me?

14:56.971 --> 14:59.230
Hey, Kemi. Jason's eggs.

14:59.307 --> 15:02.066
Tell me what you saw.
- Bad energy.

15:02.143 --> 15:04.569
The kind that bursts out
like a volcano.

15:13.062 --> 15:15.914
- C figured it out.

15:16.065 --> 15:18.499
Looks like you're about
to turn into a pumpkin.

15:21.070 --> 15:23.421
- Hey.
- Where's the picture?

15:23.498 --> 15:25.815
- Technically, it's a rendering.
- Rendering. Picture.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.759
Can you please pull it up?
- A picture is something exact.

15:27.910 --> 15:29.318
It's something that's known.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.930
A rendering like this is meant
to be just an interpretation.

15:32.081 --> 15:35.416
- Is it Keith?
Is it our son?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.435
(beeping)

15:40.331 --> 15:42.256
- He's gone, Nik.
That's him.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.091
- We don't know that yet.
- That is Keith.

15:44.169 --> 15:46.127
That is my son.
Sid was right.

15:46.204 --> 15:47.170
That is an imposter.

15:47.172 --> 15:48.279
He came into our life,
he gutted us

15:48.506 --> 15:50.431
and I'm gonna go
find out why right now.

15:50.525 --> 15:52.433
- I put the image up on NAMUS.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.767
It's running through
the database

15:53.936 --> 15:55.620
of missing children right now.
This might not be Keith.

15:55.771 --> 15:58.456
That boy up in your office
could be your son.

15:58.607 --> 16:00.607
I'm a little nervous about
what Jason is going to do

16:00.627 --> 16:02.627
before we know for sure.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.090
(tense music)

16:21.147 --> 16:23.964
- Craig?
It's Mike Sherman.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.526
I spoke to George.
He asked me to come find you.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.471
- He could be a cop killer.
- George trusts him.

16:30.548 --> 16:32.139
I'm trusting
that George is right.

16:32.217 --> 16:34.734
- If you open that door,
I'll shoot.

16:34.886 --> 16:37.644
- Craig, you know me.
You know I'm on your side.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.997
- No, you're not. No one is.

16:39.148 --> 16:40.481
- George asked me
to keep you safe.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.908
I can't do that unless
I open the door.

16:43.061 --> 16:44.627
- I said I'll shoot.

16:59.244 --> 17:00.643
- Where are they?

17:02.747 --> 17:05.023
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about?

17:05.099 --> 17:07.341
- Who are you? Huh?!

17:07.360 --> 17:09.176
Who are you?
- I'm Keith. I'm your son.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.920
- No, you're not my son.
My son's dead.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.513
He's lying on a slab downstairs.
- That's not true!

17:12.532 --> 17:14.440
No, there's been a mistake.
You've got to believe me.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.016
Dad... please.
- I'm not your father.

17:16.094 --> 17:17.109
And you're definitely
not my son.

17:17.186 --> 17:18.444
You hear me?!
- Stop it, stop it!

17:18.596 --> 17:21.264
You have to stop. Go. Get out.
- Don't defend him.

17:21.282 --> 17:22.356
- I'm not defending him.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.767
I'm protecting you
from yourself.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.711
(panting)

17:29.865 --> 17:31.049
- Thanks, Mom.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.110
(breathing heavily)

17:34.128 --> 17:35.369
You don't believe me, either.

17:35.463 --> 17:38.222
- Baby, right now, I don't
know what to believe.

17:41.469 --> 17:46.122
- You're an informant.
For the FBI.

17:46.124 --> 17:48.215
- Agent Roman was my handler.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.716
I didn't kill her at the hotel.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.736
I was meeting with her when
someone tried to kill us both.

17:51.813 --> 17:54.630
- I wanna believe you, Craig.
But if you work for the Bureau,

17:54.649 --> 17:56.056
then why are they after you?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.650
- My deal with her was with her.

17:57.726 --> 17:59.610
I wouldn't do it
if she told anybody else.

17:59.762 --> 18:01.412
Do you know how many rumors
there are about Feds

18:01.489 --> 18:04.156
on the Epsilon payroll?
- Epsilon?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.491
- A crime syndicate.

18:05.568 --> 18:08.327
The port is like
a black-market hub for them.

18:08.479 --> 18:11.238
I didn't trust anybody
at the FBI except Agent Roman.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.482
So now, no one trusts me.
- George trusts you.

18:13.501 --> 18:15.334
- George doesn't know
about any of this.

18:15.486 --> 18:18.170
About me being a CI
or about the corruption.

18:18.247 --> 18:19.746
- The corruption.
What are you talking about?

18:19.841 --> 18:21.006
- A year ago,

18:21.083 --> 18:22.767
I noticed phantom shipments.

18:22.918 --> 18:25.177
Cargo coming in,
but not on any manifest.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.271
Those shipments,
they go to Epsilon.

18:27.423 --> 18:29.515
- We found your go bag.
How do you explain that?

18:29.667 --> 18:33.185
- FBI issue. For after
I testify against Epsilon.

18:33.338 --> 18:34.612
So they wouldn't be
able to find me.

18:34.763 --> 18:37.448
Except they already did.
- Any idea how that happened?

18:37.525 --> 18:40.176
- Agent Roman and I met weekly
at the Johnston.

18:40.194 --> 18:42.511
Checked in separately.
Booked adjoining rooms.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.530
Only the FBI knew
we were meeting.

18:44.607 --> 18:47.441
That's why I ran.
I can't trust anyone.

18:47.518 --> 18:49.460
And the moment I get better,
I'll run again.

18:49.612 --> 18:51.020
- Rest up, alright?

18:51.189 --> 18:54.799
I'm gonna have a little chat
with our friends at the Bureau.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.525
- Look at you.

18:56.527 --> 18:57.635
A detective.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.712
You made it.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.305
I'm happy for you.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.015
- Thanks.

19:06.204 --> 19:08.295
- What part of
"you're off the case"

19:08.373 --> 19:10.873
did you not understand?
- The part where you said,

19:10.892 --> 19:11.983
"You're off the case."

19:12.134 --> 19:13.484
And for your sake,

19:13.636 --> 19:15.044
we'll pretend that
we're still on it.

19:15.062 --> 19:16.320
- And how would that be
for my sake?

19:16.472 --> 19:18.472
- We'll get to that.
And when we do,

19:18.549 --> 19:19.657
thank yous will be in order.

19:19.808 --> 19:21.808
- First, we'll start with
what you already know.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.478
Craig Fennessey didn't kill
your agent. He was her CI.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.390
And whoever killed her shot him.
- I'm friends with the chief.

19:27.408 --> 19:28.908
I will be speaking
to him about this.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.150
What you don't know,

19:30.170 --> 19:31.335
other than that
in the early '20s

19:31.412 --> 19:33.396
I lent J. Edgar
a hot pink corset

19:33.414 --> 19:35.155
and he never returned it...

19:35.233 --> 19:37.249
is that we have
Craig Fennessey in custody.

19:37.326 --> 19:39.326
- And if you want us
to turn him over,

19:39.345 --> 19:42.588
you have to agree to share
your case file with us.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.056
Excuse me.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.077
- The part where thank yous
are in order?

19:48.079 --> 19:49.687
That's this part.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.098
- Where's Craig?
- He's at Mercy.

19:53.175 --> 19:54.525
In recovery.
- Is he okay?

19:54.677 --> 19:56.919
- George. You were right.
This is about port corruption.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.178
He found it, and they found him.

19:58.256 --> 19:59.680
- Do you have a lead
on who shot him?

19:59.757 --> 20:02.107
- No. But he mentioned
the crime syndicate Epsilon.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.684
- So he's still a target.
- Yeah, which is why

20:03.761 --> 20:05.444
the FBI agreed to put him
in protective custody.

20:05.596 --> 20:07.705
- Cleaning up things
was supposed to be my job.

20:07.782 --> 20:10.357
If I'd done it better,
this wouldn't have happened.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.284
Bless you, Mike.
For keeping him safe.

20:12.361 --> 20:15.454
And for ignoring that
the Feds would get it done.

20:15.606 --> 20:17.440
I'm proud of you.

20:17.442 --> 20:20.109
Mike senior would've been
proud of you, too.

20:20.127 --> 20:22.202
- Means more coming from you.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.870
- He was a good man.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.282
- Until he wasn't.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.892
One of these nights,
we're gonna catch up.

20:28.043 --> 20:29.635
I'll buy you a beer.
- Hey, hey...

20:29.787 --> 20:31.120
Not if I buy you one first.

20:31.122 --> 20:33.064
(chuckling)

20:44.244 --> 20:46.318
- Next year would be seven years

20:46.395 --> 20:48.913
since Keith was
reported missing.

20:49.064 --> 20:52.808
February third...
- Hmm.

20:52.810 --> 20:56.629
- ...would be the day
that they declared him dead.

20:58.499 --> 20:59.832
- I've dreaded that day.

20:59.984 --> 21:02.760
- Yeah, me too.
And now, it's today.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.748
- They say that God...

21:07.767 --> 21:12.995
only gives you the burdens
he knows you can handle.

21:12.997 --> 21:14.847
- Yeah, he miscalculated
with me.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.774
Because I cannot...

21:16.925 --> 21:20.927
I can't go through this again.
I just can't do it, Nik.

21:21.005 --> 21:25.283
- I want to say something.
I mean, I feel like it's...

21:25.434 --> 21:27.768
it's important for me
to say it.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.346
I just...

21:30.348 --> 21:32.181
I don't want to upset you.

21:32.199 --> 21:35.293
- You won't upset me.
It's too late.

21:35.444 --> 21:38.445
- I didn't even say anything.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.074
- Fear. Dread.
Anticipatory upset

21:42.226 --> 21:45.136
is way worse than
the actual thing.

21:45.212 --> 21:47.713
- So me telling you
that I'm gonna tell you

21:47.790 --> 21:51.976
something upsetting is worse
than actually saying it to you?

21:52.127 --> 21:54.053
- Mm-hmm. Damage done.

21:54.205 --> 21:56.063
Go ahead,
say what you gotta say.

21:58.559 --> 22:00.876
- Whoever he is,

22:00.895 --> 22:03.487
even if he's not our son,

22:03.639 --> 22:05.656
there's good in him.

22:05.733 --> 22:07.658
You know, I could feel it.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.581
- Yeah. I feel it, too.

22:17.411 --> 22:21.397
- The FBI turned over the file.
- Great. Let's give it a read.

22:21.415 --> 22:24.375
- The assassin used a suppressor
with polymer-tipped bullets.

22:24.527 --> 22:26.569
- You read it already?
Impressive.

22:26.571 --> 22:28.571
- I'm the only one who has.
Remember, we basically

22:28.589 --> 22:30.014
blackmailed them for it.

22:30.165 --> 22:33.075
- I'm a slow reader.
Dyslexia.

22:33.094 --> 22:35.001
Which was only diagnosed
by a program

22:35.079 --> 22:36.336
that George got me into.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.171
It's amazing
what I owe that man.

22:38.265 --> 22:40.249
- Then I'm sure you'll give
a stirring statement

22:40.267 --> 22:42.300
at his sentencing hearing.

22:42.378 --> 22:45.437
Mike, he knew about
the polymer-tipped bullets.

22:45.514 --> 22:48.424
You told me he told you
what the assassin used

22:48.426 --> 22:50.259
when no one but the assassin
could've known.

22:50.277 --> 22:52.185
<i> - Craig couldn't shoot</i>
<i> a cap gun.</i>

22:52.205 --> 22:54.613
Let alone a suppressor
with polymer tips.

22:54.765 --> 22:57.282
- That's your theory?
That George is the assassin?

22:57.435 --> 22:59.935
- Or he hired him.
Think about it.

22:59.937 --> 23:01.103
The port is corrupt.

23:01.122 --> 23:02.621
He takes money
to look the other way.

23:02.773 --> 23:05.290
Craig tries to stop it,
Epsilon squeezes George,

23:05.443 --> 23:07.218
George takes out a hit on Craig.

23:07.369 --> 23:08.944
Only he gets away.

23:08.946 --> 23:12.965
So he turns to his surrogate son
to find him before the FBI does.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.207
- Yeah, that's a nice
fairy tale.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.951
- And it comes
with a happy ending.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.878
Craig is in
an undisclosed location

23:17.897 --> 23:19.688
where George can't find him.

23:21.459 --> 23:25.236
- But even if he could
get to him, he wouldn't.

23:25.312 --> 23:28.147
I mean, if somehow the location
had been disclosed...

23:28.223 --> 23:29.573
- Please tell me
that you didn't.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.892
- I'm sure it's nothing.

23:31.986 --> 23:33.059
- Okay, okay.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.245
We need to contact the FBI.

23:34.396 --> 23:36.488
We need to get
to the hospital right now.

23:36.641 --> 23:38.307
- Kemi, you're overreacting.
- I know that you love him.

23:38.309 --> 23:40.476
And I know this is hard
for you to hear.

23:40.478 --> 23:42.311
But he used you
to get to Craig.

23:42.329 --> 23:44.997
And my only hope is that
we find him first.

23:45.073 --> 23:48.150
(dramatic music)

23:48.152 --> 23:49.427
- So I got a hit
from NAMUS.

23:49.578 --> 23:53.055
They found a match
for a Jonathan Robbins.

23:56.752 --> 23:58.827
- That's not a better match
than the one with Keith.

23:58.829 --> 24:00.829
Can you put the other one
back up?

24:00.831 --> 24:03.065
- I can, but...
- Please?

24:18.866 --> 24:21.942
- It's not your son.

24:22.019 --> 24:23.777
- How can you be so sure?

24:23.796 --> 24:26.522
- Did Keith ever have
bone cancer?

24:26.540 --> 24:28.040
- No, no, he didn't.

24:28.042 --> 24:30.617
- Jonathan did.
And so did Yorick.

24:30.695 --> 24:33.061
Knowing what to look for,
I found microscopic residue

24:33.063 --> 24:35.864
of a tumor
on the left femur.

24:35.883 --> 24:39.218
So... yeah.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.294
It's meant to be
pretty good news.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.481
- It is.
It's fantastic news.

24:43.632 --> 24:46.725
It's just... a lot.

24:46.877 --> 24:48.043
Call the Robbins family.

24:48.045 --> 24:49.487
Tell them that we have
their son.

24:49.638 --> 24:52.397
- And we have ours. What...
What do I say to Keith?

24:52.474 --> 24:54.975
What did I do?
- Tell him that you're sorry.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.386
Okay? You're his dad.
He's gonna forgive you.

24:57.388 --> 25:00.405
(sighing)

25:00.482 --> 25:02.908
- Gummy worms are a good
ice breaker.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.960
(phone ringing)

25:07.581 --> 25:09.673
- Mike. Great news.
It's not Keith!

25:09.750 --> 25:13.736
- That is great news.
Unfortunately, my news isn't.

25:13.796 --> 25:14.995
Craig's gone.

25:15.072 --> 25:17.181
And so is his FBI
protective detail.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.766
- Did C identify the body?

25:27.918 --> 25:29.735
- Yeah. He did.

25:34.608 --> 25:36.534
I owe you an apology.

25:39.613 --> 25:43.023
What I did was inexcusable.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.859
I am so sorry.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.419
I'm sorry.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.946
- No. I'll... I'll talk to her.

25:57.965 --> 25:59.615
- You sure?

25:59.633 --> 26:01.374
- I think it's probably best
you only yell

26:01.452 --> 26:02.951
at one of your kids today.

26:02.970 --> 26:04.228
- I deserve that.

26:04.305 --> 26:08.624
- Coming home,
being with my family,

26:08.626 --> 26:12.218
it was all I thought about
when I was gone.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.405
Having Sid doubt me was hard.

26:15.983 --> 26:19.493
But having you doubt who I am
is a whole different gut punch.

26:31.090 --> 26:35.742
- I impersonated an FBI agent
to kill you and Agent Roman.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.912
But as you're still alive,
I assume you're wondering,

26:38.989 --> 26:40.989
"Am I going to die tonight?"

26:41.008 --> 26:42.491
The answer is yes.

26:42.509 --> 26:46.053
There isn't a realistic
scenario that I can let you go.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.607
You know too much about Epsilon
and my connection to it.

26:49.683 --> 26:52.425
But I don't take pleasure
in killing people,

26:52.503 --> 26:56.505
so I'm gonna go eat
a lamb chop, drink some wine,

26:56.523 --> 26:59.007
change the dressing
over the bullet hole

26:59.026 --> 27:00.451
your handler gifted me

27:00.527 --> 27:02.845
and give you a chance
to think about the manner

27:02.863 --> 27:05.164
in which you want
that to happen.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.368
- You told Lyle.
- Yes.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.111
And when I realized
what I'd done--

27:11.188 --> 27:12.187
- Led the killer to his victim.

27:12.189 --> 27:13.613
- I sent a patrol
to bring him in.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.949
- Bring him in,
and not arrest him. Mike!

27:15.968 --> 27:16.967
- I told George the location.

27:17.044 --> 27:18.527
But we have no proof
that he went

27:18.696 --> 27:21.046
or that he sent anyone there.
So no, he's not under arrest.

27:21.198 --> 27:23.215
Or on the run.
Patrol went to his house,

27:23.291 --> 27:24.675
he gave up no resistance.
- Lyle's here.

27:24.827 --> 27:27.536
- Try to remember that your job
is to question him,

27:27.538 --> 27:29.963
and not to pin him with a medal.
- Kemi, you're in with Mike.

27:30.057 --> 27:31.565
We'll be watching.

27:34.545 --> 27:36.820
How's Keith?

27:36.897 --> 27:38.380
- He's very upset at me.

27:38.399 --> 27:41.233
And that's gonna take
a little while.

27:41.309 --> 27:44.553
But we've got time.
- Yeah.

27:44.571 --> 27:46.905
- You wanna bring me up
to speed on the case?

27:46.982 --> 27:49.083
(door opening)

27:51.562 --> 27:53.245
- What's going on, Mike?
- We'll explain.

27:53.397 --> 27:55.063
But you need to sit down.
- I'm gonna sit down

27:55.065 --> 27:56.415
when I know why
I'm sitting down.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.067
- Craig's security detail
was hit outside the hospital.

27:59.086 --> 28:00.752
He's been taken.
- Which out of deference

28:00.829 --> 28:02.328
to your long history,
Mike is pretending

28:02.406 --> 28:03.405
that you don't already know.

28:03.424 --> 28:05.683
Me, I'm not
the deferential type.

28:05.759 --> 28:07.393
Sit down.

28:11.432 --> 28:13.749
- Did you do it, George?
- Are you really asking me that?

28:13.767 --> 28:15.175
- You knew about
the suppressor.

28:15.252 --> 28:16.342
- You of all people!

28:16.344 --> 28:17.343
- And the polymer-tipped
bullets.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.178
- I raised you.

28:18.255 --> 28:19.196
You're here because of me!

28:19.273 --> 28:20.698
- Yeah. Yeah,
I'm here because of you.

28:20.849 --> 28:22.182
You owe me nothing.
I owe you everything.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.017
Still doesn't give you
the right to play me.

28:24.094 --> 28:25.260
- The FBI knew where he was.

28:25.279 --> 28:27.520
It's obvious.
They got someone on the take.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.406
- You knew Craig and I
were friends.

28:29.483 --> 28:31.024
<i> You knew I'd do anything</i>
<i> to find him.</i>

28:31.101 --> 28:33.452
So did you, George?
Did you play me?

28:33.528 --> 28:36.380
- No, I did not.

28:36.531 --> 28:39.091
Any other questions,
you can ask my lawyer.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.947
- That's it. He's done talking.

28:44.965 --> 28:46.281
- Maybe I can fix that.

28:46.300 --> 28:50.043
- Please, just don't make me
regret it.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.303
- We're kind of
in the middle of something.

28:51.472 --> 28:53.789
- It looked like you were
kind of at the end of it.

28:53.807 --> 28:55.791
I'd like to take a swing
with your permission.

28:55.793 --> 28:57.976
- By all means.

28:58.128 --> 29:00.070
- George.
Can I call you George?

29:00.222 --> 29:01.387
- No. You may not.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.240
<i> - George, are you familiar</i>
<i> with Fairhill?</i>

29:03.317 --> 29:04.633
It's Epsilon territory.

29:04.635 --> 29:07.077
The Fairhill guys
deal Meth. Molly.

29:07.229 --> 29:09.304
As luck would have it,
bad for you, good for me,

29:09.306 --> 29:11.156
I worked Vice in Fairhill.

29:11.233 --> 29:13.308
And I was able to turn
an Epsilon man.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.085
Made him my CI.
- Next, you're gonna tell me

29:15.162 --> 29:17.755
he ID'd me as the guy
who took Craig.

29:17.906 --> 29:19.256
Well, let me save you
the trouble.

29:19.333 --> 29:20.665
I've been a cop my whole life.

29:20.742 --> 29:23.427
And unlucky for you,
I know all the tricks.

29:23.504 --> 29:27.413
- He didn't ID you to me.
I ID'd you to him.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.175
I told him that you were in here
singing for your supper,

29:30.327 --> 29:32.010
telling us everything
there is to know

29:32.162 --> 29:33.604
about how Epsilon works.
- I don't know

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
how Epsilon works.
- But they think that you do,

29:35.833 --> 29:37.608
so what they do with that
information, I don't know.

29:37.759 --> 29:39.167
I hope that they don't hurt you.

29:39.186 --> 29:41.094
But at the same time,
I can't keep you here.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.005
So what do you say
we go for a ride?

29:43.023 --> 29:44.506
- A ride? Where?

29:44.599 --> 29:46.191
- To see your friends
at the port.

29:46.309 --> 29:48.452
Fingers crossed,
they'll be happy to see you.

29:57.779 --> 30:00.372
- Hey, you mind telling me
what the hell that was?

30:00.524 --> 30:03.358
- Teaching an old dog
some new tricks.

30:03.377 --> 30:04.968
- By pretending to put
a target on his back?

30:05.195 --> 30:06.194
You don't have a CI at Epsilon.

30:06.196 --> 30:07.453
- He doesn't know that.

30:07.531 --> 30:10.048
Which means that he thinks that
they're probably

30:10.200 --> 30:11.475
gonna kill him
unless we protect him.

30:11.552 --> 30:12.959
- Which he knows we'll only do
if he confesses.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.795
- Even if he has anything
to confess in the first place.

30:15.889 --> 30:18.056
- Mike, if this does work,
and he does confess,

30:18.208 --> 30:19.316
none of it will
stand up in court.

30:19.467 --> 30:22.319
- Right. Because I lied
to a suspect.

30:22.396 --> 30:25.305
- A good defense lawyer will use
that to kick George free.

30:25.382 --> 30:26.639
- Craig Fennessey
has been taken.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.550
If he's not dead already,
he will be soon.

30:28.552 --> 30:30.310
This is the only way
we're gonna get to him in time.

30:30.387 --> 30:32.387
If George walks
because of what I just did,

30:32.406 --> 30:34.331
I'm not gonna lose any sleep.
Are you?

30:34.482 --> 30:35.999
- I will not.

30:38.562 --> 30:40.671
- Looks like
we're going for a ride.

30:45.027 --> 30:46.326
(knocking on door)

30:46.403 --> 30:49.346
- Sidney.
It's not your fault.

30:49.497 --> 30:51.256
Even if you'd raced home
to tell Mom,

30:51.333 --> 30:54.667
I still would've been taken.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.836
Sid?

30:56.856 --> 30:59.439
Listen to me.
It's not your fault.

31:04.179 --> 31:06.679
Okay. Okay. Alright.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.940
Now that you're finally
convinced I'm alive,

31:09.017 --> 31:10.683
try not to choke me to death.

31:10.703 --> 31:13.537
(laughing)

31:13.688 --> 31:15.447
- Do you remember this?

31:15.599 --> 31:17.374
- From Camp Shewahmegon.
Are you kidding?

31:17.451 --> 31:19.284
That won me the Chipmunk
Chatter award for best crafting.

31:19.361 --> 31:21.436
- I found it on your desk.

31:21.438 --> 31:23.029
Along with all
of the homework assignments

31:23.123 --> 31:24.456
that you didn't need to do.

31:24.532 --> 31:27.626
- And some people say
getting abducted is all bad.

31:27.778 --> 31:29.945
- I needed it...

31:29.963 --> 31:33.539
to feel you were with me.

31:33.617 --> 31:35.467
And now you are.

31:35.619 --> 31:38.044
Do you really
remember everything?

31:38.063 --> 31:40.122
- Yeah, I do.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.065
- Could you tell me about it?

31:45.295 --> 31:47.145
- I have some questions.

31:47.297 --> 31:48.405
Your level of cooperation

31:48.556 --> 31:52.392
will determine the tenor
of the evening.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.745
(gasps)

31:54.821 --> 31:57.748
- Whatever I could tell you,
I've already told the FBI.

31:57.866 --> 31:59.917
- You told Agent Roman.

31:59.993 --> 32:01.567
But as I put a bullet
in her head,

32:01.645 --> 32:03.903
I think your secrets
are safe with her.

32:03.981 --> 32:05.589
So tell me...

32:05.666 --> 32:07.257
What are your secrets?

32:07.334 --> 32:09.167
- She filed reports
about Epsilon.

32:09.319 --> 32:11.670
Last week. Last month.

32:11.822 --> 32:13.413
Hurting me won't change that.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.580
- Ah. About that.

32:14.658 --> 32:18.084
I have no intention
of hurting you.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.771
I have people
who do that for me.

32:20.847 --> 32:23.756
The enthusiastic degenerate
who's livestreaming this

32:23.776 --> 32:27.277
can confirm that Dr. Walker
is home with his wife

32:27.354 --> 32:29.020
and three beautiful children.

32:29.173 --> 32:30.948
- Please, no!
He's just a friend!

32:31.099 --> 32:32.340
He doesn't know anything!

32:32.509 --> 32:35.026
- You're going to tell me
everything the FBI knows

32:35.103 --> 32:36.436
about my operation,

32:36.455 --> 32:39.848
or I'm going to instruct
said degenerate to exit his car,

32:39.850 --> 32:41.199
knock at the house

32:41.351 --> 32:44.127
and shoot whoever
opens the door.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.090
- Please, no.

32:53.697 --> 32:55.621
- You know calling
Russian Roulette "Russian"

32:55.641 --> 32:56.548
is a misnomer?

32:56.791 --> 32:58.033
It's kind of like
Chinese Checkers,

32:58.202 --> 33:01.052
which was not invented
in China and is not checkers.

33:01.205 --> 33:03.146
Also strawberries,
not a berry.

33:03.298 --> 33:06.875
But a banana?
A banana is a berry.

33:06.893 --> 33:08.134
So is an avocado.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.319
Point being, Russian Roulette

33:09.471 --> 33:12.380
was first played right here
in Philadelphia

33:12.399 --> 33:15.308
by a man known as
the Philadelphia Frenchman

33:15.327 --> 33:18.811
who is not from
Philadelphia or French.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.405
Is nothing what it seems?

33:20.557 --> 33:23.166
- I got no idea what
you're talking about.

33:23.318 --> 33:25.335
- No?

33:25.487 --> 33:27.337
Let me clarify.

33:27.489 --> 33:29.231
You're playing Russian Roulette.

33:29.233 --> 33:31.249
Epsilon is holding the gun.

33:31.401 --> 33:34.327
The question you have to ask
yourself is simple:

33:34.404 --> 33:36.254
Do they care
that you talked?

33:36.331 --> 33:39.349
If yes, then there is
a bullet in the chamber.

33:39.426 --> 33:42.835
And if no, then there isn't.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.095
- But I haven't talked.

33:44.172 --> 33:47.524
- Like I said,
nothing is what it seems.

33:50.178 --> 33:52.863
- Decision time, Craig.

33:52.939 --> 33:55.090
- Okay.

33:55.108 --> 33:58.351
- Stand down.

33:58.428 --> 34:02.021
I'm afraid it's hard
to leash a hungry dog.

34:02.099 --> 34:04.023
(doorbell ringing)

34:04.101 --> 34:05.784
- I said okay!
I'll tell you.

34:05.936 --> 34:09.454
- Tell me? Tell me what?
- Everything!

34:09.606 --> 34:11.506
(speaking in foreign language)

34:20.467 --> 34:23.118
- So...

34:23.120 --> 34:24.394
Everything.

34:24.471 --> 34:25.711
Let's hear it.

34:25.731 --> 34:29.791
- To be clear, George,
we don't want you to die.

34:29.793 --> 34:31.976
But don't think for a second
that because we're cops

34:32.129 --> 34:34.129
we won't pull over,
open these doors

34:34.147 --> 34:36.031
and give you the boot.

34:38.635 --> 34:39.725
And before you think
any less of us,

34:39.803 --> 34:41.894
if you are killed,
we will do our very best

34:41.972 --> 34:44.414
to find the person who killed
you and bring them to justice.

34:44.491 --> 34:47.167
- That's comforting.
Thank you.

34:51.815 --> 34:52.589
- The boot.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.591
You're about to get it.

34:56.336 --> 34:58.486
I'm a shaman, George.
I don't read minds

34:58.488 --> 35:00.322
and I can't predict the future.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.099
But that car's been
following us since the precinct.

35:02.217 --> 35:03.992
And I guarantee you,
in about a minute,

35:04.010 --> 35:07.729
whoever is in that car
is coming for your head.

35:12.093 --> 35:13.610
- I cooperate,
you protect me?

35:13.761 --> 35:15.094
- From whoever's in that car

35:15.114 --> 35:17.739
and everyone he works for, yes.

35:26.032 --> 35:27.849
- Epsilon has an enforcer.

35:27.851 --> 35:29.033
Jack Dalton.

35:29.110 --> 35:31.686
He's your shooter.
- Okay, good.

35:31.705 --> 35:35.298
Now tell me how did Jack Dalton
know who to shoot?

35:35.450 --> 35:37.759
- I'm the one who
gave him Fennessey.

35:39.546 --> 35:42.121
And when he screwed up the hit,
I'm the one who got him back.

35:42.199 --> 35:44.123
<i> - And how did you do that?</i>

35:44.201 --> 35:45.383
- By using Mike.

35:45.460 --> 35:48.145
<i> I traded on our relationship</i>

35:48.296 --> 35:50.205
and the love he has for me.

35:50.223 --> 35:52.732
- Baby, I'm sorry.

35:59.599 --> 36:01.883
- Hey, hey, hey...

36:01.885 --> 36:03.684
- Hey, Mike...
- Where is he, George?

36:03.686 --> 36:06.054
- I can explain.
- Shut up! Where's Craig?

36:06.056 --> 36:08.814
- I don't know.
- Mike! Mike!

36:08.834 --> 36:10.500
- I have two questions.
- Mike, put the gun down!

36:10.577 --> 36:13.244
- You wouldn't dare, Mike!
- Whether I'd dare or not

36:13.397 --> 36:14.913
depends on your answer
to the first.

36:14.989 --> 36:17.916
My dad.

36:17.992 --> 36:21.085
Did you lie to me about him?

36:21.238 --> 36:22.596
- I'm sorry, Mike.

36:24.499 --> 36:26.257
- Mike, you don't want
to do this.

36:26.410 --> 36:29.394
- Craig Fennessey. I dare you
not to tell me where he is.

36:36.028 --> 36:36.985
- We're done here.
Get the car.

36:39.105 --> 36:41.272
- Wait. I told you
everything I know.

36:41.349 --> 36:43.258
- And you knew too much.

36:43.276 --> 36:47.278
Which is good for me,
but very bad for you.

36:47.355 --> 36:48.930
- Please don't kill me. Please.

36:48.932 --> 36:52.316
(tense music)

36:52.394 --> 36:55.286
- MPU, hands where
we can see them!

36:55.288 --> 36:57.088
- Go, go, go!
(gunshot)

37:02.295 --> 37:04.137
(grunting)

37:06.950 --> 37:08.558
- Dalton, where is he?

37:14.624 --> 37:17.141
- Hey. Where's Dalton?
- He ran. That way.

37:17.294 --> 37:19.885
- I got it, you go.
It's okay.

37:19.963 --> 37:21.571
You're gonna be okay.

37:33.493 --> 37:34.751
(gun cocking)

37:34.828 --> 37:36.569
- I know you.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.313
You're George's kid.

37:38.331 --> 37:40.072
This is good.
You helped him.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.483
Now you're gonna help me. C'mon.

37:41.501 --> 37:44.669
We're gonna walk
out of here together.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.013
(grunting)

37:51.937 --> 37:53.603
(glass breaking)

38:00.854 --> 38:02.779
- Mike, Mike... Hey, hey!

38:02.930 --> 38:04.856
That's enough. It's over.

38:05.008 --> 38:07.525
(breathing heavily)

38:07.677 --> 38:10.453
- It may be done.
But it's not over.

38:14.034 --> 38:15.350
Mike Sherman. PPD.

38:15.368 --> 38:17.777
I need you to pull a file
on another detective.

38:17.854 --> 38:19.020
Ex-detective.

38:19.039 --> 38:21.039
- What's the detective's name?

38:21.115 --> 38:24.283
- Mike Sherman.

38:24.361 --> 38:26.786
I took your word for it.

38:26.863 --> 38:29.121
About my father.
I believed you.

38:29.199 --> 38:30.289
Believed in you.

38:30.367 --> 38:33.143
So much so that I never
pulled his file.

38:33.294 --> 38:37.314
Never looked at who
the investigating officers were.

38:37.465 --> 38:40.725
Area Six Detective
George Lyle and J.R. Dalton.

38:40.802 --> 38:43.545
You made it look like
he was in Epsilon's pocket.

38:43.547 --> 38:45.638
When it was you
and Dalton who were.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.066
Craig Fennessey
is repeat business, isn't he?

38:48.218 --> 38:49.400
The innocent man
you tried to destroy

38:49.477 --> 38:52.403
before he finds out enough
to destroy you.

38:52.556 --> 38:55.314
In Craig's case, you made him
look like an assassin.

38:55.392 --> 38:57.742
In Dad's case,
you made an honest man

38:57.894 --> 38:59.169
look like a crooked cop.

38:59.245 --> 39:01.729
- I raised you, Mike.

39:01.823 --> 39:03.673
You know what kind of man I am.

39:03.750 --> 39:06.084
- The last thing that
I ever said to him was,

39:06.160 --> 39:08.419
"You're dead to me."

39:08.496 --> 39:14.075
Yeah, George, I know exactly
the kind of man you are.

39:14.094 --> 39:16.519
(door opening)

39:29.609 --> 39:30.867
Say it.

39:31.094 --> 39:32.260
I crossed the line.

39:32.278 --> 39:34.454
Didn't stay in my lane.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.267
- He betrayed you.

39:39.269 --> 39:40.785
Betrayed your father.

39:40.937 --> 39:42.212
Betrayed an old friend.

39:42.288 --> 39:43.546
- I put a gun to his head, Jay.

39:43.698 --> 39:45.289
He would've given me
a different answer,

39:45.366 --> 39:49.052
I can't say that I wouldn't
have pulled the trigger.

39:49.129 --> 39:52.797
- I felt betrayed today.
And that line, I...

39:52.949 --> 39:55.058
I basically sprinted
right through it.

39:55.135 --> 39:56.784
It's hard not to.

39:56.803 --> 40:01.305
It's maybe impossible to
forgive yourself when you do.

40:01.458 --> 40:02.957
- There's somewhere
I gotta go.

40:02.976 --> 40:05.068
- Yeah. Just come with me first.

40:08.131 --> 40:13.225
- We are here to forgive
and to ask for forgiveness.

40:13.245 --> 40:17.155
The bowl represents the world.

40:17.231 --> 40:19.974
- You guys okay?
- Yeah. Keith and I are good.

40:19.993 --> 40:21.309
- You and Keith.

40:21.311 --> 40:24.162
- Yes. Keith. My brother.

40:24.314 --> 40:27.257
- These candles are our vessels.

40:27.408 --> 40:29.909
But we cannot light them yet.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.096
Not until we forgive ourselves.

40:33.247 --> 40:35.156
Not until we forgive others.

40:35.175 --> 40:38.493
And not until others forgive us.

40:38.511 --> 40:42.981
Until then, our lights
cannot shine.

40:47.762 --> 40:50.262
Your stone...

40:50.282 --> 40:53.116
contains all that
remains unforgiven.

40:53.267 --> 40:55.026
It holds your burdens.

40:55.178 --> 40:56.844
It's the weight
on your shoulders.

40:56.938 --> 40:59.396
It's your heavy heart.

40:59.549 --> 41:02.350
And there's only one way
to be rid of it.

41:02.352 --> 41:05.036
You have to release it yourself.

41:05.112 --> 41:07.355
The world will absorb it.

41:07.373 --> 41:10.875
The world wants
to give you this gift.

41:10.952 --> 41:12.618
Trust the world.

41:12.696 --> 41:16.473
It will pull all of those
negative spirits down.

41:16.624 --> 41:18.549
Release your burdens.

41:18.702 --> 41:19.476
Forgive.

41:19.627 --> 41:21.978
And ask for forgiveness.

41:25.225 --> 41:26.483
In accepting forgiveness,

41:26.634 --> 41:30.302
we remind the world
of the good we bring.

41:30.322 --> 41:33.064
(crying)

41:33.216 --> 41:34.382
- Thank you for this.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.477
Not knowing,
that was the hard part.

41:38.497 --> 41:42.890
At least now we can finally
put Jonathan to rest.

41:42.909 --> 41:45.893
- We remind the world
of the sacrifices

41:45.912 --> 41:47.462
we make for others.

41:53.828 --> 41:57.405
- I think this is the part
where I say thank you.

41:57.407 --> 41:58.515
Again.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.016
<i> - And we remind the world</i>

42:00.167 --> 42:03.686
<i>that our story is not finished.</i>

42:03.763 --> 42:05.480
(sighs)

42:07.584 --> 42:09.008
- Hey, Dad.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.677
- Now your vessels have light.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.988
Now you can see.

42:17.351 --> 42:20.703
And the world has
gifted you a new future.

42:23.783 --> 42:25.449
- I, um...

42:25.544 --> 42:29.361
I understand if you don't
want to see me.

42:29.455 --> 42:33.550
- I think about you
every day, you're my son.

42:33.701 --> 42:38.096
Every day for the last 20 years,
I was hoping for this day.

42:46.456 --> 42:48.606
(sighing)

42:53.129 --> 42:54.962
(sighing)

42:54.981 --> 42:58.057
- So?
- So I was wrong.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.317
And I apologized.

42:59.411 --> 43:02.912
- And I told her she has
nothing to apologize for.

43:03.064 --> 43:04.639
- So it's done.
It's finally over.

43:04.641 --> 43:07.667
- Well, there's just
one more thing.

43:09.329 --> 43:12.071
- I'm ready to talk about it.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.648
- Talk about what?

43:13.666 --> 43:16.509
- I'm ready to talk about
who kidnapped me.

43:19.097 --> 43:19.971
(tense music)

43:22.158 --> 43:24.726
Subtitling: difuze
