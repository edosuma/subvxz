But then...Oh, never mind.
I'm sorry.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.214
You're busy with your pacing
so I'll...

09:43.216 --> 09:44.616
- No, no, no. Tell me.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.685
- Okay, the business
is called "crystal clean"

09:47.754 --> 09:49.754
Where I, crystal,
come and clean.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.689
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.291
- What's the problem?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.760
- Well, it's a mobile cleaning
service, so I need mobility.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.229
You know, something big enough
for a vacuum, industrial mops,

09:58.365 --> 10:00.832
Maybe someday,
more employees.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.933

Isn't she beautiful?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.972
- Yes!

10:08.008 --> 10:11.242
- Unfortunately, I was not able
to secure financing

10:11.378 --> 10:13.078
At the dealership,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.913
When they found out that my
last name is leblanc.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.249

And said location was being
surveilled by the cops,

10:42.476 --> 10:44.208
How would you go about
doing that?

10:44.277 --> 10:46.343
- How many entrances are there?
Are we taking day or night?

10:46.380 --> 10:49.848
Digital security or ugmo
with walkie-talkies? Wait...

10:49.983 --> 10:53.084

with your like, hot biker guy?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.171

I'd stay clear

gale's dangerous,

11:16.109 --> 11:18.008

- So, you need a sheep?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.378

Okay. Um, well, like

to be lost in the mall

11:27.421 --> 11:29.921
To pickpocket anyone who
tried to stop and help me,

11:29.990 --> 11:31.856

He was very curt.
- Oh.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.986

- Just this is bad!

19:50.756 --> 19:53.491
You can't just scoop
someone else's drop!

19:53.493 --> 19:55.826

for my new boyfriend.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.500

squeezing you out

20:03.536 --> 20:06.303
Of a bigger cut of the profits?
(inhales nervously)

20:06.372 --> 20:08.372
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

20:08.374 --> 20:10.608
But the house usually gets
30 percent.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.644

20:13.680 --> 20:15.912

I agreed to the service fee.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.949
