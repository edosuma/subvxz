00:50.297 --> 00:54.801
I'm just saying that "Kent Drake"
is not the name of a real person.

00:54.835 --> 00:58.738
I've seen his file and his picture.
We had a videoconference interview.

00:58.773 --> 01:01.908
Tall, dark, handsome,
suit slightly too large for his body?

01:02.910 --> 01:05.912
Because his superhero
suit is on underneath it.

01:05.946 --> 01:09.315
He is not a superhero.
He is a military-school graduate.

01:09.350 --> 01:12.318
- Superhero.
- Glasgow Medical School.

01:12.353 --> 01:15.889
- Just finished a tour in Afghanistan.
- Marvel superhero.

01:15.923 --> 01:18.158
Well, is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

01:18.192 --> 01:20.660
If you have to ask...

01:20.694 --> 01:23.730
Anyway, he wants to
move from trauma medicine

01:23.764 --> 01:26.032
to forensic pathology,
and Kent is the strongest

01:26.033 --> 01:28.301
applicant I've had for an
assistant medical examiner

01:28.335 --> 01:32.138
- since I came to Boston, so...
- Six-month rotation?

01:32.173 --> 01:33.873
You'll spend the entire
time trying to figure out

01:33.908 --> 01:37.811
what his superhero power is...
or isn't. [door opens]

01:39.980 --> 01:42.949
- Wow!
- Uncle Enzo was getting rid of it.

01:42.983 --> 01:45.919
I can understand why.
That is horrible!

01:45.953 --> 01:48.955
Oh, I have seen worse, and,
even if it is, it was free.

01:48.989 --> 01:50.857
Well, the true value of something

01:50.891 --> 01:52.926
isn't always determined
by its price, Angela.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.329
Which is a super polite way of say
"that is horrible!"

01:56.363 --> 02:00.166
Well, you two don't have to look at it.
I got it for Frankie.

02:00.201 --> 02:02.135
[Cellphones ring] Well, he doesn't
have any taste. He'll probably love it.

02:02.169 --> 02:05.071
- Rizzoli.
- Isles.

02:05.106 --> 02:07.207
Hey, I need some help getting
this to Frankie's place.

02:07.241 --> 02:10.026
It'll have to wait till later. Sorry.

02:10.205 --> 02:13.024

Homeless guy found her this morning.

02:57.458 --> 03:00.827
- Didn't s her get dumped.
- You want to keep her wrapped up, right?

Yes, I don't want to lose anything

03:02.830 --> 03:04.731

How does everybody know I'm trying
to get the Bric Commander job?

03:11.772 --> 03:14.474
Because you've had lunch
with every boss at BPD.

03:14.508 --> 03:16.309
Well, not every boss.

03:18.913 --> 03:21.117
[Laughs, snorting]

03:22.783 --> 03:26.753
Well, I would say he has
a temporomandibular disorder.

03:26.787 --> 03:30.356
- Makes chewing difficult.
- Oh.

03:30.391 --> 03:32.926
Well, he doesn't know you said it.

you take him out to lunch?

03:35.329 --> 03:38.965
I don't feel that bad.
[Laughter]

03:38.999 --> 03:41.000
The dumpster was emptied two days ago,

03:41.035 --> 03:43.203
so the body could only
have been there since then.

03:43.237 --> 03:46.005
Are there any offices or apartments
that are near this alley?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.440
No, it's all warehouses
and manufacturing.

03:47.474 --> 03:51.477
Well, that probably means she
came from somewhere else, then.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.780
And judging by the size of this rug,

03:53.814 --> 03:55.248
might have taken two
people to get her here.

03:55.282 --> 03:57.283
Two people who didn't think
anybody would notice them

03:57.318 --> 03:59.118

03:59.153 --> 04:01.888

04:13.334 --> 04:15.468

Hopefully, we can help
with identification.

- They're very comfortable.

- Is she always like that?
- Yes.

notice three weeks ago.

giving you her notice?

06:24.218 --> 06:29.524
No. She'd been pulling away
from all of us for a while.

- You must have some idea.
- Spike.

- Is that her boyfriend?
- Yeah.

his parents gave him.

she ever called him.

06:47.221 --> 06:49.435

- Last time I saw him.

06:57.364 --> 07:00.466
I never liked him,
but with your friends,

07:00.501 --> 07:04.003
it's hard to say something, you know?

apartment being this nice.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.456
Yeah, it's a different
apartment. He moved.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.959
- What?
- Yeah, this one is two floors higher.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.396
I guess I didn't notice
what button you pushed in elevator.

07:43.430 --> 07:47.300
I was so worried about
trying to avoid a hernia

07:47.334 --> 07:50.970
- of the entire body.
- That's not what a hernia is. [Chuckles]

07:51.004 --> 07:54.474
Yes, I know that.
How come I didn't know

07:54.508 --> 07:55.975
that Frankie was getting a new place?

07:56.009 --> 08:00.646
- Uh... he was keeping it a secret?
- Until when?

- [Door opens] I...
- Oh! What the hell?!

08:04.318 --> 08:09.722
- Until now, I'm guessing.
- I've seen your chest.

I was gonna tell you, sis,
as soon it's all fixed up.

- There ... it's all fixed up.
- I don't want that.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.405
- It's a nice chair.
- It's awful,

08:26.440 --> 08:31.639
- and I'm trying to go a different way.
- Yeah, the secret way.

08:31.674 --> 08:35.243

Like you don't have any secrets.

08:35.277 --> 08:38.446

I'm allowed to have secrets.

not only quit her job,</i>

<i>she closeder social-media accounts,</i>

09:30.440 --> 09:32.541
cancelled her cellphone,
stopped using her credit cards.

09:32.576 --> 09:34.610
To top it all off, when
they searched her apartment,

09:34.645 --> 09:35.811
they found a packed suitcase.

09:35.846 --> 09:38.781
- She was about to go on the run.
- Or went to a convent.

09:38.815 --> 09:41.350
Both good options for a
woman with a bad boyfriend.

09:41.385 --> 09:43.619
Well, I think there are a few other
things she might have considered.

09:43.654 --> 09:47.256
I didn't find any calls to shelters
or restraining orders filed with police.

09:47.290 --> 09:51.627
Is there any evidence that
Spike was actually abusive?

09:51.662 --> 09:53.596
One neighbor said she
never heard em fighting,

09:53.630 --> 09:56.499
but a couple of weeks ago,
she complimented Spike on his hair ...

09:56.533 --> 09:58.134
he almost ripped her head off.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.836
- So he's wild and a little tight.
- Clearly.

10:00.871 --> 10:03.869
Tight enough to snap if he thought
Mona was gonna leave him?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.641
Only way to know for
sure is to find him.

10:06.176 --> 10:08.910
Is her apartment missing a rug?

10:08.995 --> 10:12.055
Hardwood floor is no way to know.

If it was easy, anybody could do it.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.421
[Telephone rings]

10:18.455 --> 10:21.457
- Holiday.
- Rizzoli.

10:21.491 --> 10:23.276

mom would serve for dinner.</i>

10:23.311 --> 10:26.395
"Kids, come to the table.
The holiday Rizzoli is ready."

10:26.430 --> 10:29.665
- You don't know many Italians, do you?
- Just you guys.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.134
Because my ma woul said
that about 80 decibels louder

10:32.169 --> 10:34.270

"before I" and "don't make me"

10:41.264 --> 10:44.351
- a Cecil Wilson.
- Is that the boyfriend, "Spike?"

10:44.385 --> 10:46.887
If my name were Cecil, almost
anything would be preferable.

10:46.921 --> 10:49.656
- We have an address?
- Yep. I'll text it to you.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.793

any evidence you deem necessary.

11:01.803 --> 11:05.339
- How long have you actually worked here?
- About five years.

And did you ever practice
any other type of medicine

11:06.507 --> 11:09.576
- before you became an M.E.?
- Only in my residency.

11:09.610 --> 11:11.278
So, our refrigerated
storage is down the hall.

11:11.312 --> 11:12.713
Would you like to see it?

11:12.747 --> 11:15.248
Do you actually enjoy this
managerial side of your job?

11:15.283 --> 11:20.454
- You ask a lot of questions.
- I'm sorry. I'm just curious.

11:20.488 --> 11:21.822
I am not prying maliciously.

11:21.856 --> 11:24.812
Please, feel free to
ask me anything you like.

11:26.294 --> 11:29.596

24:03.462 --> 24:05.296
Yeah, but if they're drinking
the same kind of drink

24:05.330 --> 24:08.816
and Sean Hughes and Mona Carson are
connected and he's murder-adjacent,

24:08.817 --> 24:12.303
and I can keep looking into
his shooting as part of my case.

24:12.337 --> 24:14.806
I will totally forgive
you for taking my coffee.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.174
You're welcome.

24:16.208 --> 24:20.553
Korsak, hey, what
judge owes you a favor?

24:21.346 --> 24:24.315
I-I'm really sorry, detectives.
I'm not supposed to let anyone in.

24:24.349 --> 24:27.752
Right, except for anyone involved
in the investigation.

24:27.786 --> 24:32.089
- Uh...
- Good for you, standing your ground.

24:32.124 --> 24:35.827
- I'm sure that Sergeant...
- Washington.

24:35.861 --> 24:38.262
...Washington would
like to hear about this.

24:38.297 --> 24:39.764
Not every newbie can do that.

24:39.798 --> 24:41.899
- Aren't you impressed, Korsak?
- Bursting.

24:41.934 --> 24:43.963
Thanks. Good job.

24:49.141 --> 24:51.509
- Korsak: What the hell are those?
- I have no idea.

24:51.543 --> 24:53.010
[Cellphone beeps]

24:53.045 --> 24:55.346
[Camera shutter clicks]

24:56.582 --> 24:58.449
[Telephone rings]

24:58.484 --> 25:01.135
- Jane, I ...
- Hey, I just sent you a picture.

25:01.136 --> 25:03.988
<i>What are we looking at?
[Mouse clicks]</i>

25:04.022 --> 25:06.631
Look at the back or the bottom.
See if there are any labels.

25:07.059 --> 25:10.194
Yeah, FCO, DME, SFX.

25:11.463 --> 25:13.164
Those are routers.

25:13.198 --> 25:14.398
<i>The codes on the bottom
correspond to airport codes</i>

25:14.433 --> 25:15.967
of the cities they're routing through.

25:16.001 --> 25:18.102
- Jane ...
- Routers?

25:18.136 --> 25:20.304
And they had programmer
food in their stomachs.

25:20.339 --> 25:23.078
These three knew each other.
They were up to something.

25:23.113 --> 25:24.676
- Jane ...
- That's why Sean Had a gun.

25:24.677 --> 25:26.844
- That's why Mona is dead.
- Korsak.

25:26.879 --> 25:28.779
- Yes?
- Can you guys come back to BPD?

25:28.814 --> 25:31.249
Yeah, we'll be right there.

25:32.059 --> 25:34.385
[Keyboard keys clacking]

25:34.419 --> 25:36.487
Hey. Let's see it.

25:36.522 --> 25:38.523
I grabbed the footage
from social-media sites,

25:38.557 --> 25:41.000
so it's jumpy and there
are missing moments,

25:41.041 --> 25:43.367
but it's the best I can
do with what we've got.

25:49.539 --> 25:52.839
- Stop. Back it up.
- What?

25:55.302 --> 25:57.891
There.
[Computer beeps]

25:58.544 --> 26:01.178
<i>Play it forward, slowly.</i>

26:07.185 --> 26:10.210
- There was a gun.
- Somebody took it.

26:10.245 --> 26:12.023
We know it wasn't Spike
because we saw him run off.

26:12.057 --> 26:15.626
- Are you gonna tell IAD?
- No.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.128
They won't let Frankie off the hook

26:17.162 --> 26:19.030
unless we can deliver
them another suspect.

26:19.064 --> 26:23.189
- So we should do that.
- Yes, we should.

26:23.223 --> 26:26.357
- Mwah.
- That's Rizzoli-ese for "thank you."

26:36.374 --> 26:38.942
- Hey, Korsak.
- Yeah.

26:38.977 --> 26:41.745
Come here for a sec.
[Mouse clicks]

26:47.185 --> 26:49.586
Watch this guy right here.

26:49.621 --> 26:51.288
[Computer beeps]

26:51.322 --> 26:53.957
He doesn't panic when
Frankie's gun goes off.

26:53.992 --> 26:56.994
No, and then he just
calmly walks into the crowd.

26:57.028 --> 26:59.229
Like he sees Sean's gun on the ground

26:59.264 --> 27:02.166
- and heads over to pick it up?
- Yeah.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.968
- Why?
- Maybe he needed a gun.

27:05.003 --> 27:08.038
Or maybe he didn't want
Sean to be found with a gun.

27:08.073 --> 27:10.107
Again, why?
[Sighs]

27:10.141 --> 27:14.645
Well, we have Spike, who runs
right near a guy with a gun,

27:14.679 --> 27:17.331
then we have this guy,
who is completely unfazed

27:17.332 --> 27:20.284
- by the entire thing.
- Some sort of criminal conspiracy.

27:20.318 --> 27:22.186
I'm okay with saying they
weren't planning a bake sale.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.388
[Chuckles] Yeah.

27:27.292 --> 27:31.028
The algorithms for facial recognition
fall into two categories ...

27:31.062 --> 27:33.030
geometric, which focuses on features,
[Jane sighs]

27:33.064 --> 27:34.765
and photometric.

27:34.799 --> 27:36.633
So how long does this program
usually take to find a match?

27:36.668 --> 27:39.636
A few minutes.
A few days.

27:39.671 --> 27:41.738
Forever.

27:41.773 --> 27:44.808
This is the Essex
Street subway platform.

27:44.843 --> 27:46.810
And this is where Boston rapid transit

27:46.845 --> 27:48.946
keeps the wireless routers
that control the signal lights

27:48.980 --> 27:50.747
and the switches for the West Side.

27:50.782 --> 27:53.417
Huh. So maybe Mr. Laptop was
trying to break in to the router

27:53.451 --> 27:56.854
to disrupt traffic, even crash a train.

27:56.888 --> 28:01.358
- Hello.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Kent Drake.

28:01.392 --> 28:02.893
Vince Korsak.

28:02.927 --> 28:05.195
Kent is doing rotation
here before taking over

28:05.230 --> 28:07.297
as the assistant medical
examiner in Springfield.

28:07.332 --> 28:10.234
You two have a lot in common.
You're both ex-military.

28:10.268 --> 28:14.771
- Oh. Vietnam?
- Spanish-American war.

28:14.806 --> 28:17.341
That's funny.

28:18.476 --> 28:21.879
- At least my shoes have laces.
- Jane: I hate him.

28:21.913 --> 28:23.981
[Chuckles]

28:24.015 --> 28:28.252
- Kent: So, are we narrowing the search?
- Yes, but the trick is

28:28.286 --> 28:31.455
to not narrow it so much
that you exclude the subject.

28:31.789 --> 28:34.324
[Computer beeps]

28:34.359 --> 28:35.759
This one didn't.

28:38.897 --> 28:43.367
Jane: John Stanton.
Six months ago, his house was seized,

28:43.401 --> 28:45.202
eminent domain,

28:45.236 --> 28:47.871
and he was arrested for trying
to set fire to a bulldozer.

28:47.906 --> 28:49.528
Guy with a cause
collected a few cohorts.

28:49.563 --> 28:52.309
- Who took his house?
- BRT.

28:52.343 --> 28:55.179
His house was in the new path of
the Southern spur of the subway.

28:59.984 --> 29:02.753
Detective Hitchcock told me that,

29:02.787 --> 29:04.154
even if you had a warrant,
I shouldn't let you in.

29:04.189 --> 29:06.490
- Hard seems sporting.
- Or legal.

29:06.524 --> 29:08.258
I got to call in.

29:08.293 --> 29:09.359
I've got a warrant, and I'm
not gonna let you stop me,

29:09.394 --> 29:11.995
but you call internal affairs.
I don't want you getting in trouble.

29:12.030 --> 29:12.896
- Good man.
- Well, I'm not trying to ...

29:12.931 --> 29:17.267
- We got about 15 minutes.
- A router isn't gonna give us much ...

29:17.302 --> 29:20.003
an IP dress, a log of who accessed it.

29:20.038 --> 29:23.207
John Stanton has been completely
off the grid for two months.

29:23.241 --> 29:26.910
- A PI address and a log is more than we had.
- IP address.

29:26.945 --> 29:29.513
- What'd I say?
- PI address.

29:29.547 --> 29:31.415
That'd come as no surprise to you that I

29:31.416 --> 29:33.283
often don't know what
you're talking about.

29:33.318 --> 29:34.885
[Chuckles]

29:34.919 --> 29:35.953
[Beeping]

29:35.987 --> 29:38.055
- Weird.
- What?

29:38.089 --> 29:40.390
Someone's pinging this location,
trying to get a response.

29:40.425 --> 29:41.858
Can you tell where they are?

29:41.893 --> 29:44.361
Shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.

29:52.537 --> 29:57.341
- Y-You can't see who it is, though.
- No, but I have a name

29:57.375 --> 29:59.443
and a pretty good idea
of what this is about,

29:59.477 --> 30:02.086
so that's enough for me to catch him.

30:04.249 --> 30:07.150
- Thanks, Jane!
- Okay.

30:07.185 --> 30:09.286
- Okay! [Laughs]
- Lots of feelings.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.990
- I get it, yeah okay.
- Oh, god! [Cellphone ringing, buzzing]

30:13.024 --> 30:16.426
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay, wait for it. Oh.

30:16.461 --> 30:17.861
Ugh.

30:17.895 --> 30:19.830
It's Korsak. 
He wants you to meet him.

30:19.864 --> 30:23.133
- All right, the hug's over, Frankie.
- All right.

30:23.167 --> 30:25.369
[Laughs]

30:27.305 --> 30:29.373
Ah!

30:29.407 --> 30:34.011
- You okay to get a ride back to precinct?
- Uh, no problem.

30:34.045 --> 30:35.379
[Chuckles]

30:35.413 --> 30:37.881
[Door opens]
[Laughs]

30:44.956 --> 30:47.524
- Have you seen him?
- We don't know who's in there.

30:47.558 --> 30:49.893
Nina just said someone
inside that restaurant

30:49.927 --> 30:51.928
is pinging the router
at Sean Hughes' house.

30:51.963 --> 30:55.399
You know IAD is gonna go
ballistic if we arrest someone.

30:55.433 --> 30:57.440
This totally throws a monkey wrench
in their plan

30:57.441 --> 30:59.403
- to pin this on Frankie.
- I know.

31:01.205 --> 31:03.573
Well, I uld understand if
you wanted to stay here.

31:03.608 --> 31:06.209
Up yours, Rizzoli.

31:09.701 --> 31:13.157
[Music]

31:22.927 --> 31:23.994
I'm ready.

31:29.234 --> 31:33.036
Well, well, well.
Cecil.

31:33.071 --> 31:34.905
Nice to finally meet you.

31:40.961 --> 31:43.827
<i>Spike: I didn't have
anything to do with that. </i>

31:43.862 --> 31:45.431
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

31:45.466 --> 31:48.601
But you knew she was dead,
or you wouldn't have run from us.

31:48.636 --> 31:50.436
Maybe I just don't like cops.

31:50.471 --> 31:52.672
You know, we hear that a lot,
usually from guilty people.

31:52.706 --> 31:56.025
- I didn't kill Mona.
- Did John Stanton?

31:56.810 --> 31:59.712
Yeah, we know about him.
We know about his beef with the BRT.

31:59.747 --> 32:00.780
Did you know that Sean died?

32:00.814 --> 32:02.515
So that leaves you and John

32:02.549 --> 32:04.617
as the only two people
that we get to put in jail

32:04.652 --> 32:06.786
for whatever stupid thing
that you had planned,

32:06.820 --> 32:08.488
but you're the only
one we got in custody.

32:08.522 --> 32:11.745
- We didn't do anything. 
- Not yet. Do you think

32:11.780 --> 32:13.726
John Stanton's sitting around,
wondering how you're doing?

32:15.195 --> 32:16.963
The minute that he puts
your plan into action

32:16.997 --> 32:18.464
is the minute that
you're on the hook for it,

32:18.499 --> 32:21.768
and her murder
and Sean's shooting.

32:22.102 --> 32:24.596
Who doesn't like cops now?

32:37.618 --> 32:39.719
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, yes.

32:39.753 --> 32:42.121
Um, Susie told me to get her ready

32:42.156 --> 32:45.224
so that she can be
released to her family.

32:45.259 --> 32:48.795
Okay.

32:48.829 --> 32:54.119
- Does it make you feel any better?
- What?

32:56.203 --> 33:00.940
Does it make you feel any better
figuring out who committed the murder?

33:03.944 --> 33:08.220
It's very satisfying
using science to solve a mystery.

33:09.817 --> 33:12.612
I don't think that answers my question.

33:17.091 --> 33:21.027
Some cases are...

33:21.061 --> 33:24.897
so awful that I put them away.

33:24.932 --> 33:27.600
I choose not to think about them

33:27.634 --> 33:30.803
so they don't color
my view of the world.

33:30.838 --> 33:35.742
But most of the time,
I believe that the truth

33:35.776 --> 33:40.947
helps the people 
who loved these victims.

33:40.981 --> 33:44.851
I guess that makes me feel better.

33:44.885 --> 33:47.854
[Chuckles]

33:48.488 --> 33:50.870
Good answer.

33:57.865 --> 34:01.713
Come on.
You can see a gun.

34:02.302 --> 34:04.237
Frankie didn't shoot an unarmed man.

34:04.271 --> 34:06.739
What you just showed me
doesn't prove anything.

34:08.641 --> 34:10.842
Okay, okay, fine. 
How about this?

34:10.878 --> 34:12.779
[Computer beeps] 
All right, Mona Carson.

34:12.813 --> 34:15.581
This guy, John Stanton, killed her,

34:15.616 --> 34:18.885
and we believe that Sean Hughes
helped dispose of her body.

34:18.918 --> 34:22.855
You have a very active
imagination, detective.

34:22.889 --> 34:24.556
Mona Carson is dead
because she was involved

34:24.591 --> 34:27.927
in a plan to crash a subway train
at Essex Street station.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.652
Do you have proof of any of this?

34:33.934 --> 34:36.869
Meet Cecil Wilson.

34:36.904 --> 34:38.971
Was there a plan to
crash a subway train?

34:39.005 --> 34:41.924
- It was mostly John. We were ...
- Was Sean supposed

34:41.925 --> 34:46.550
- to bring a gun to the platform?
- Yes.

34:49.183 --> 34:51.583
Now, we have solved this case for you,

34:51.618 --> 34:56.355
and we'll let you take the credit
if you call the D.A.'s office right now

34:56.389 --> 34:58.769
and tell them that
Frankie did nothing wrong.

34:59.760 --> 35:04.322
- Where's Stanton?
- I'll tell you after you make the call.

35:07.067 --> 35:10.018
Come on. You get to take
a picture with the mayor!

35:13.173 --> 35:14.774
[Cellphone beeps]

<i>This is Detective Hitchcock.
I need to speak to the D.A.</i>

35:19.346 --> 35:23.382
Okay, where's Stanton?
I have no idea.

35:23.417 --> 35:26.919
I will tell you ...
he's too smart to go to Essex Street.

35:26.954 --> 35:28.921
Now, there are three
other subway stations

35:28.956 --> 35:30.656
with wireless routers.

35:30.691 --> 35:32.058
What do you say we split up and find him

35:32.092 --> 35:34.397
before he kills a bunch
of innocent people?

35:34.398 --> 35:36.129
[Music]

35:39.032 --> 35:41.667
- I don't see him.
- Me either.

35:41.702 --> 35:43.470
I mean, now that we're down
here, do you think he would

35:43.471 --> 35:45.238
actually risk getting caught
on one of these platforms?

35:45.272 --> 35:50.743
- I wouldn't, not if I could avoid it.
- Neither would I.

[Telephone rings]

35:54.214 --> 35:55.815
Holiday.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.316
Hey. Is there any way that Stanton

35:57.351 --> 35:59.819
could turn off the signal
lights or switch the tracks

35:59.853 --> 36:01.754
without ever coming
down to the platform?

36:01.788 --> 36:04.357
<i>Maybe. He'd need a booster
to amplify the wireless signal</i>

36:04.391 --> 36:05.958
so he could access it above ground.

36:05.993 --> 36:09.095
- What does a booster look like?
- A plastic box.

36:09.129 --> 36:11.764
Small.
He could tape it anywhere,

36:11.798 --> 36:12.865
but he'd want line of
sight for a better signal.

36:12.900 --> 36:16.002
- I'll look this way.
- Okay.

36:39.293 --> 36:42.895
Korsak, I found it.

36:52.098 --> 36:53.198
I unboosted him.

37:00.573 --> 37:03.242
- There he is.
- Mm-hmm.

37:05.979 --> 37:09.248
[Indistinct conversations]

37:16.923 --> 37:19.424
Mnh-mnh.
Put the laptop down.

37:19.459 --> 37:20.926
[Sighs]

37:21.995 --> 37:24.429
You're gonna be losing
a lot more than that signal.

37:24.464 --> 37:26.531
[Handcuffs click]

37:34.040 --> 37:38.377
- Hey, we're heading out.
- Oh, great. Have a good ...

37:38.411 --> 37:41.580
- Nice!
- He looks superhot, right?

37:41.614 --> 37:43.803
I-Is that a bad thing to say?

37:43.959 --> 37:47.301
It ... it's not actionable, is it?
I mean... he don't work for me.

37:48.123 --> 37:52.961
Okay, well, then I will
meet you in the lobby.

37:52.995 --> 37:54.429
Oh.

37:54.463 --> 37:58.032
So, the toe shoes were uncomfortable?

37:58.067 --> 38:01.002
No.

38:01.036 --> 38:03.571
I just don't like people
making assumptions about me.

38:03.606 --> 38:07.375
Ex-military guy puts on
a slightly nerdy affect

38:07.409 --> 38:10.345
- to throw off his new colleagues.
- Yeah, something like that.

38:10.379 --> 38:15.984
- Exactly like that.
- I wanted to see how you'd react,

38:16.018 --> 38:22.423
- what you'd react to.
- Still, it's a bit like lying, isn't it?

38:23.689 --> 38:24.931
Yeah.

38:25.127 --> 38:28.225
But we all lie in our
own little way, don't we?

38:32.034 --> 38:33.401
Have a nice evening.

38:41.243 --> 38:44.345
Yeah, I thought he was
gonna cry when you called.

38:44.380 --> 38:48.182
Who are you kidding? 
He cried.

38:48.217 --> 38:52.920
Yeah, he cried.
Don't tell him I told you!

38:52.955 --> 38:55.166
- Here we are!
- Oh! What are these?

38:55.201 --> 38:58.292
Hi!
These are called the last word.

38:58.327 --> 39:00.328
Seemed an appropriate way
to celebrate our victory.

39:00.362 --> 39:01.596
Yes.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.132
<i>- Oh, okay.
- Cent'anni.</i>

39:04.166 --> 39:07.935
<i>- Cent'anni.
- Mmm.</i>

39:09.505 --> 39:10.438
[Coughs]

39:10.472 --> 39:11.639
[Clears throat]

39:11.674 --> 39:14.042
Well, that'll put hair on your chest.

39:14.076 --> 39:16.310
Speaking of hairy
chests, where's Frankie?

39:16.345 --> 39:18.146
He went to go pick
some stuff up, he said.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.948
He should've stuck around to
keep an eye on his liquor cabinet.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.117
I cleaned him out.
[Laughter]

39:23.152 --> 39:25.086
This is a great apartment.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.921
I just can't believe he kept it secret.

39:26.955 --> 39:29.090
I can't believe how much I'm
starting to like this chair.

39:29.124 --> 39:31.926
- Oh.
- Hey!

39:31.960 --> 39:34.295
- Hey.
- Hello.

39:34.329 --> 39:36.297
Ooh! Did you bring dinner?
 I'm starving!

39:36.331 --> 39:38.933
No.
I hope better.

39:38.967 --> 39:43.337
I was, uh...
well, I guess I was scared,

39:43.372 --> 39:49.944
and, uh, I wanted to show
you all how much I ...

39:49.978 --> 39:57.018
- Thank you.
- I mean, uh, I really appreciate what ...

40:01.056 --> 40:05.259
I know how hard you worked to ...

40:11.533 --> 40:15.141
You got me a signed
Ted Williams baseball?

40:15.222 --> 40:18.372
Whaaat?!
Frankie!

40:18.407 --> 40:20.708
That is amazing. Thank you.

40:20.743 --> 40:25.179
- That's what I was trying to say.
- We made you a drink.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.449
It's right there
next to that beautiful

40:27.450 --> 40:29.550
side-by-side
fridge
you didn't tell us about.

40:29.585 --> 40:31.864
I was gonna tell you.

40:40.662 --> 40:43.065
Are you doing okay?

40:44.466 --> 40:48.469
Yeah. Yeah.

40:48.504 --> 40:53.074
He, uh...
He died, Jane.

40:53.108 --> 40:57.969
I know, I know.
It was a ... it was a good shoot.

41:01.350 --> 41:04.585
But I-I didn't mean for anyone to die.

41:04.620 --> 41:08.589
Well, that's how we tell the
good guys from the bad guys.

41:10.626 --> 41:15.969
The good guys always feel it
when something bad happens.

41:17.326 --> 41:19.350
Now when you're gonna tell
me about this barman?

41:21.617 --> 41:23.779
[chuckling]
[mandoline plays]

41:27.033 --> 41:28.576
[sighs]

41:31.673 --> 41:35.184
[chuckling]
Whoo.

41:35.650 --> 41:37.997
[chuckling]

41:38.281 --> 41:41.809
<i>- Ah. Very nice. [applause]
- [laughter] Bravo!</i>
