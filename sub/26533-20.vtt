WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.613
Previously onCharmed...You are gonna help me raise

00:04.656 --> 00:06.615
the Source of All Evil.

00:06.658 --> 00:07.920
MEL:
So, Fiona brought on

00:07.964 --> 00:09.574
the blossoming of death
by killing the Sarcana.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.535
She's the Keeper of the Flame
that controls magic,

00:13.578 --> 00:16.059
and she's about to retrieve
the Origin Dagger.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.321
Find me Fiona.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.716
Why is the Keeper of the Flame
paving the way

00:20.759 --> 00:22.805
for the Source of All Evil?
It doesn't add up.

00:22.848 --> 00:26.852
Guess I'm gonna need to use the old evil sight more and more.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.071
You're playing
with your dark side.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.725
I suspect
it'll come at a cost.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.031
It's all under control.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.606
This is Cate.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.086
Yeah, I'm leaving court now.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.219
You must be my new temp.
Thank you.

00:45.262 --> 00:48.048
Yep, that's fine.

00:48.091 --> 00:51.051
Have Amanda pull up the files.
I'm on my way.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.757
MAN:
Central, we've got someone
down in the front lobby.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.063
Now please call 911.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.934
Miss? Are you okay?

01:04.977 --> 01:07.110
Miss?

01:14.204 --> 01:15.814
Elder Silver. Is this about...

01:15.858 --> 01:18.252
The fact that you cost us
another Whitelighter?

01:19.601 --> 01:22.560
No, that is not
why I'm here.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.955
The truth is

01:25.998 --> 01:28.305
I need your help.You sentenced me to death.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.220
And have repeatedly failed
the Charmed Ones.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.571
It's time to put
our differences aside.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.225
We don't take orders
from you anymore.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.226
The tide is turning.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.836
Evil is upon us.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.838
Another Elder has been murdered.

01:39.882 --> 01:42.145
Elder Cate Monroe,
earlier today.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.148
Charity was the
one killing Elders.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.237
She's been locked up.
Why would anyone do this?

01:47.281 --> 01:49.892
I thought you warned them
about the Prophecy.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.850
Did you not?

01:51.894 --> 01:55.767
According to the Prophecy,
before the Source of All Evil

01:55.811 --> 01:58.161
can rise and usher in
the apocalypse,

01:58.205 --> 01:59.902
certain events must transpire.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.735
Elder Monroe's murder means
that someone else is trying

02:06.778 --> 02:09.303
to complete the Prophecy,
by killing every last Elder.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.869
Could it be Alistair?

02:10.913 --> 02:13.089
At least the next part of
the Prophecy can't happen

02:13.133 --> 02:15.047
while Charity is down there.Why is that?

02:15.091 --> 02:16.875
As the ancient text states,

02:16.919 --> 02:20.401
the Source will be brought about
by the Harbinger of Hell,

02:20.444 --> 02:23.099
who will tip the scales of
evil with a deluge of blood

02:23.143 --> 02:25.057
and the deafening screams
of human torment.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.321
Harbie's been locked
in a paint can

02:27.364 --> 02:29.453
that only the three of us
and Charity can open.

02:29.497 --> 02:33.370
And Charity's in Tartarus
being tortured by scorpions.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.503
Well, that does
buy us some time.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.114
But meanwhile, Alistair Caine
is surely recruiting

02:38.158 --> 02:39.768
the Steward of the Source
to his cause.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.858
The what, now?
According
to demonic lore,

02:42.901 --> 02:45.556
he is the immortal protector
of the Source itself.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.341
Like the Keeper of the Flame?

02:47.384 --> 02:49.517
May I?

02:54.739 --> 02:57.481
Witches have always worshipped
the Flame of Magic,

02:57.525 --> 03:00.658
and demons want to get their
hands on the Source of All Evil.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.008
But what if they're
the exact same thing?

03:03.052 --> 03:06.316
Two different expressions
of the same raw power.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.405
But if that's true,
then Fiona's not only

03:08.449 --> 03:10.625
the Keeper of the Flame,
she's the Steward of the Source.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.017
MAGGIE:
It's her.

03:12.061 --> 03:15.499
She's the one killing Elders.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.285
If the sages fall, she can raise
the Source or the Flame,

03:18.328 --> 03:19.634
or whatever you want to call it,

03:19.677 --> 03:21.984
and control
all of that power herself.

03:22.027 --> 03:25.379
Then we have to find her and
stop her before she kills again.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.471
Did you sleep at all?

03:30.514 --> 03:31.907
Elder Silver seemed
really freaked out

03:31.950 --> 03:33.474
about this whole
Fiona thing.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.217
No almond milk.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.306
Oh, yeah, it must have
slipped my mind.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.611
Seriously?

03:40.655 --> 03:43.135
Sorry, it's kind of hard
to focus on groceries

03:43.179 --> 03:45.399
when the apocalypse is looming.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.535
Whatever.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.627
Macy, your-your eyes.

03:56.671 --> 03:57.715
What?

03:57.759 --> 04:00.718
They flashed. Like, demon-style.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.765
That's impossible.
I-I would've known.

04:03.808 --> 04:06.202
But we both saw it.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.815
Or maybe you're just seeing
what you want to see, Mel.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.601
Like how you turned a blind eye
to the most dangerous witch

04:13.644 --> 04:16.734
we've come across
because of your crush on Jada.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.171
Whoa.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.825
You're blaming me for this?

04:20.869 --> 04:25.656
I am sick of having to do
everything myself around here.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.400
I'm gonna go and see
if Harry's made any progress

04:30.444 --> 04:32.968
on that tracking spell.

04:33.011 --> 04:35.187
Why don't you two
make yourselves useful

04:35.231 --> 04:37.233
and figure out
a way to find Parker.

04:44.675 --> 04:48.200
Wow. That was weird.

04:54.032 --> 04:57.601
Oh, hi, Maggie.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.255
Hello, Mel.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.563
Hi, Lucy. What-what...
What are you doing here?

05:02.606 --> 05:04.869
Official Kappa biz.
I need that margarita recipe

05:04.913 --> 05:07.350
for the Cinco de Mayo party.
Can I borrow?

05:07.394 --> 05:10.353
You do know that we're Puerto
Rican, not Mexican, right?

05:10.397 --> 05:13.530
Doy, I know that. But Maggie
made those epic skinny margs

05:13.574 --> 05:14.836
for the Halloween party.

05:14.879 --> 05:18.274
Oh. Right.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.711
Sure. Sure.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.542
Do you mind
if I utilize your loo?

05:25.586 --> 05:28.676
I can't be the number one Kappa
caught doing number two.

05:28.719 --> 05:31.374
Oh. Yes.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.594
Go right ahead.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.509
Straight up there.

05:41.210 --> 05:44.387
What are we gonna do?

05:44.431 --> 05:47.912
Those skinny margs were
glamours. There's no recipe.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.262
Relax. You're talking to The
Haunt's bartender of the month.

05:54.266 --> 05:57.095
Hmm. Remember when we
fought when we were kids?

05:57.139 --> 05:59.533
Mom would put us in here and
we weren't allowed to come out

05:59.576 --> 06:02.100
until we made up.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.667
I see what
you're trying to do here,

06:03.711 --> 06:06.191
but I don't think putting me
and Macy in the book nook

06:06.235 --> 06:07.584
is going to fix this.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.151
Don't underestimate
the power of the nook.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.675
Look, we need to get Lucy
out of here because you and I

06:11.719 --> 06:13.547
are supposed to figure out
how to find Parker

06:13.590 --> 06:15.810
before he gets turned into
the Source of All Evil.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.594
Remember? Macy's orders?

06:17.638 --> 06:20.205
See, that's what I mean about
her demon side coming through.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.903
She's never treated
us like that before.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.905
Bossing us around?

06:23.948 --> 06:27.343
We can't let her use
the evil sight anymore.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.301
I don't like
what it does to her.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.298
HARRY:
And I could've sworn...

07:11.343 --> 07:13.520
Ah, here we go.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.481
Belonged to Fiona.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.964
Birthday present
from me, actually.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.401
It's nice.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.710
I'm sorry, Harry.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.321
Yes, well. At least we
can put it to good use

07:32.364 --> 07:33.322
in that tracking spell.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.324
And then what?

07:35.367 --> 07:37.108
Say we find her.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.850
How do we defeat
a witch who's immortal?

07:39.894 --> 07:41.939
She'll always have
the upper hand.

07:41.983 --> 07:46.509
I do know a process
that strips one's immortality.

07:46.553 --> 07:51.427
Unfortunately, it's brutal...
and must be self-inflicted.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.124
Oh.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.911
The tracking spell Harry found
for Fiona only works on witches,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.695
so Parker's a no-go.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.482
What are you doing?

08:02.525 --> 08:05.006
Just doodling.

08:05.049 --> 08:08.400
Look. It's pretty good.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.663
Hmm.

08:09.706 --> 08:13.275
Show me a spell to track demons.

08:17.061 --> 08:20.587
Huh? It's an astral
projection spell.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.852
Think the Book'strying
to tell us something.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.551
Look.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.336
There's a page ripped out.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.078
Lucy.

08:34.122 --> 08:37.081
Coco's cocoa butter-- I'd
recognize that smell anywhere.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.650
But what would Lucy want
with The Book of Shadows?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.609
I mean, she's been acting
really weird lately.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.132
Lately?

08:44.175 --> 08:46.351
I'm serious.
Always on her phone,

08:46.395 --> 08:48.919
kind of obsessed
with Parker and I.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.401
Wait.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.621
MAGGIE:
Is it just me,
or is Lucy everywhere lately?

08:54.664 --> 08:57.058
LUCY:
Bellinis for Parkerita.

08:57.101 --> 09:00.409
MAGGIE:
Lucy's the last person
we saw before Parker got sick.

09:00.452 --> 09:02.585
She bought us drinks.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.588
Maybe Lucy's the key
to finding Parker.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.548
I never thought I'd say this,
but we've got to get to Kappa.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.245
Come on.

09:11.638 --> 09:15.250
Galvin said it was
all his grandmother's artifacts.

09:15.293 --> 09:18.035
Uh, Harry,
look at this.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.604
You can read this?

09:21.648 --> 09:24.259
Yeah. Can you not?

09:24.302 --> 09:25.608
No.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.045
This is Illevaihcam.

09:29.177 --> 09:32.223
Otherwise known
as the Devil's Tongue.

09:32.267 --> 09:36.358
Another perk to my dark side:

09:36.401 --> 09:39.491
demonic translation.

09:39.535 --> 09:40.754
Uh, well,

09:40.797 --> 09:42.799
this here describes
a practice

09:42.843 --> 09:44.627
similar to voodoo.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.237
So I was thinking,

09:46.281 --> 09:48.588
with the tracking spell you have
to find Fiona,

09:48.631 --> 09:50.459
plus the immortality-stripping
spell...

09:50.502 --> 09:54.028
Which must be
self-inflicted, so...

09:55.682 --> 09:57.379
So you'll make a voodoo doll?

09:57.422 --> 10:00.687
No. I'm gonna be
the voodoo doll.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.608
Find Fiona Callahan,

10:08.651 --> 10:10.914
a witch without a coven.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.836
Wait.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.849
What are you doing with that?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.678
I needed something sharp.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.202
I really don't think
we should be using that.Harry.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.030
There's a good chance
she's going to resist

10:40.074 --> 10:41.553
when I do this.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.478
Oog-basa...

10:53.522 --> 10:55.002
dormi-saunt...

11:14.238 --> 11:15.979
Oog...

11:16.023 --> 11:19.156
basa-dormi-saunt.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.646
Oog-basa-dormi-saunt.

11:31.647 --> 11:35.782
What are you doing to me,
demon?!

11:51.667 --> 11:53.582
No. No, Macy!

11:53.625 --> 11:55.671
Macy, no!

11:55.715 --> 11:56.933
Not the needle.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.413
Macy, not the needle!

12:06.943 --> 12:09.119
No! No!

12:12.296 --> 12:14.472
Jarridnee

12:14.516 --> 12:17.780
min an-noor

12:17.824 --> 12:19.477
el-abadeyy.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.367
Macy.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.065
Macy, come back to me.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.806
Please.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.376
No, stay away!

12:57.820 --> 12:59.779
FIONA:
You must be Alistair Caine.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.651
Looks like I'm not the only one

13:02.694 --> 13:05.697
looking to kill my rival
for the Source.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.226
If you're looking for
the Origin Dagger,

13:12.269 --> 13:14.184
you're too late.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.407
Well, if you have the Dagger,
then you must know

13:19.450 --> 13:20.625
that the prophecies
speak of a Steward

13:20.669 --> 13:22.845
who will activate the Source
on your behalf.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.848
I was told the Steward
would make his way to me

13:25.892 --> 13:27.241
in the final days.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.243
Her way, you idiot.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.596
I'm your damn Steward.

13:36.598 --> 13:40.167
So witches...

13:40.210 --> 13:43.170
demons...

13:43.213 --> 13:47.435
we're all after
the same raw power.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.437
And I'm the only one
who can give it to you.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.832
But first you have to help me
stop this bleeding.

14:07.281 --> 14:10.066
It worked.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.112
Fiona's mortal.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.896
Macy, you could have died.
What's happening?

14:13.940 --> 14:15.898
Your eyes, your voice.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.119
Stop. Listen.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.729
There's more.

14:20.772 --> 14:24.951
Fiona... is working...

14:24.994 --> 14:26.996
with Alistair.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.967
I am applying this green mask
for the fiesta,

14:41.010 --> 14:42.533
so my skin looks good.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.972
Maybe I was onto
something when I tried

14:46.015 --> 14:48.365
to vanquish her when
you were rushing Kappa.

14:48.409 --> 14:51.499
Lucy is not a demon, Mel.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.981
Then why does she want a page
from The Book of Shadows?

14:55.024 --> 14:57.070
Wait.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.681
Her phone.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.336
Lucy's not a demon,
but what if she's

15:02.379 --> 15:04.947
under the influence of one?
I mean, think about it.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.036
She must have met Parker's dad
when they were dating.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.039
You think she's working
for Alistair?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.954
No, I think
he's using technology

15:11.998 --> 15:14.348
to mesmerize her
and make her do his dirty work.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.393
Huh.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
Revelate.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.100
She's gotten
multiple video calls

15:27.143 --> 15:28.666
from this
international number.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.712
That must be him.Okay, you said she's been

15:30.755 --> 15:32.932
really obsessed with seeing
you and Parker together.

15:32.975 --> 15:33.933
Yeah?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.586
If Alistair wants you and Parker

15:35.630 --> 15:37.197
to be in love...

15:37.240 --> 15:40.069
I'm his insurance policy,
aren't I?

15:40.113 --> 15:42.071
He must think that
if you love Parker enough,

15:42.115 --> 15:44.769
you won't let us use the
Power of Three to vanquish him.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.336
You know what?
It'll be fine.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.947
We will just CSIthe crap
out of this call log

15:47.990 --> 15:49.426
and find Parker
before it's too late.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.178
MAGGIE: It says here only the mesmerist

16:02.222 --> 16:03.875
can un-mesmerize his victim.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.747
Poor Lucy.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.881
MEL:
I'm not having
any luck either.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.234
How is she?

16:14.277 --> 16:15.844
Resting.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.455
Reluctantly. I still
don't think she understands

16:18.499 --> 16:21.023
how far she pushed herself
with that ceremony.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.459
It was that bad?

16:22.503 --> 16:24.113
It seems,
with each attempt,

16:24.157 --> 16:26.115
she sinks deeper
into her darkness,

16:26.159 --> 16:29.249
letting go of her witch side.
After she nearly bled out,

16:29.292 --> 16:33.253
I tried to bring her back,
and she shoved me.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.297
Quite forcefully.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.995
Oh, my God, she attacked you?

16:36.038 --> 16:38.171
No. No, I didn't say

16:38.214 --> 16:40.129
"attacked."

16:40.956 --> 16:43.045
Although it was unsettling.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.048
As far as we know,
there is no Power of Three

16:46.092 --> 16:48.094
if one of you
becomes a demon.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.052
She must never again
be permitted to use...

16:50.096 --> 16:53.229
What am I not permitted to do?

16:56.928 --> 16:59.192
Use my demon side?

16:59.235 --> 17:02.108
Use Elder Bari's needle,
in particular.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.371
We're just concerned
for you, is all.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.895
You do realize
it's worked every time.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.636
Right?

17:08.679 --> 17:11.813
I just stripped away
Fiona's immortality.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.250
I saw...

17:14.294 --> 17:16.165
that she's joining forces
with Alistair

17:16.209 --> 17:18.689
and got confirmation
that the Source and the Flame

17:18.733 --> 17:21.170
are in fact the same thing.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.172
Just like I suspected.

17:23.216 --> 17:26.001
Just like wesuspected.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.394
Sure.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.830
You ought to be resting.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.876
You ought not
to tell me what to do.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.581
I'll get it.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.815
Hey.Hey, can we talk?

17:57.859 --> 18:00.035
Yeah, of course.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.840
I thought you were gonna
keep that on for protection.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.147
Uh, it got too
complicated.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.585
♪ Got nothing left...

18:28.629 --> 18:31.458
Did Greta ask about it?

18:31.501 --> 18:34.069
And I obviously can't tell
her what it's really for

18:34.113 --> 18:37.594
or why you and I have been
spending so much time together.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.857
The wedding's in two days,

18:39.901 --> 18:41.642
and she point-blank
asked me this morning

18:41.685 --> 18:43.339
if I have feelings for you.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.646
♪ Never be lonely...

18:50.390 --> 18:52.392
What did you say?

18:52.435 --> 18:55.046
When Greta and I
got back together two years ago,

18:55.090 --> 18:58.833
it was right after
my whole... breakdown.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.009
I needed someone.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.054
And ever since,
she's always wondered

19:03.098 --> 19:04.882
if the only reason
we're together is just because

19:04.926 --> 19:07.972
she happened to be there.
You know?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.108
What do you think?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.763
♪ Who I was before I let...

19:15.806 --> 19:18.722
I think that
I'm about to get married

and all I can think about
is you.

♪ What do you want?

19:22.857 --> 19:25.773

♪ If I never knew you,
I'd never be lonely. ♪

19:55.281 --> 19:56.456
Oh, Niko.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.241
You are just the person
I-I wanted to see.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.547
I am?
She is?

20:00.590 --> 20:03.289
Yeah. Yeah, Mel and I,
we-we found these

20:03.332 --> 20:06.292
incoming phone calls on an app,
but we don't know how

20:06.335 --> 20:08.555
to reverse-hack them to find out
where the calls originated.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.557
That's not what hacking is.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.255
See? You already know
so much more than us.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.215
So can you do it?

20:16.258 --> 20:18.782
Yeah, sure. It might
take some time, but yeah.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.132
Thank you so much.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.832
Well, I should go.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.660
I will keep you posted.

20:30.838 --> 20:33.536
Take care of yourself.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.234
Thanks.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.979
You saw.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.633
I saw.She kissed me first.

20:43.677 --> 20:44.678
Yeah, it really
seemed like

20:44.721 --> 20:45.896
you were fighting
her off, Mel.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.768
I know. It was incredible.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.770
Okay.

20:49.813 --> 20:53.426
Well... clearly you're
still in love with her.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.428
And, I mean,

20:55.471 --> 20:58.605
you already broke up her
and Greta once before.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.694
I'm just saying.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.739
If Elder Silver's sketchbook
of wonders is right,

21:02.783 --> 21:04.872
then the end of the
world is basically

21:04.915 --> 21:06.874
right around the corner.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.746
Maybe Niko deserves to know
the truth before it's too late.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.053
That I rewrote
her entire history?

21:12.096 --> 21:13.881
Without her consent?

21:13.924 --> 21:15.099
I can't.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.928
Can't what?

21:17.972 --> 21:19.713
It's not important.

21:22.106 --> 21:25.849
Good. Because we
have a problem.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.991
Elder Hathaway was found
in her office

21:37.034 --> 21:38.688
at Hudson University
disemboweled.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.777
Elder Kalani's head
was left on a beach in Kauai.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.214
Fiona's getting
even more vicious.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.868
There are only six of us left.

21:44.912 --> 21:49.177
Then why don't we stop hiding
and take the fight to them?

21:49.220 --> 21:51.005
Lure them into a trap.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.180
HARRY:
But if we do,

21:52.223 --> 21:53.790
we'll need to get a message

21:53.834 --> 21:55.836
to Alistair and Fiona.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.971
I think we know the
perfect messenger.

22:01.015 --> 22:04.584
I want this mole spread
as diverse and varied

22:04.627 --> 22:07.891
as the Mexican culture
that it represents.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.478
Elder Robinson
should be here by now.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.915
I'm sure she'll get
to the house soon.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.613
Assuming Lucy's message
made it to Alistair,

22:33.656 --> 22:36.050
he and Fiona should be
on their way to our house, too.

22:36.093 --> 22:38.269
As soon as anyone steps inside,

22:38.313 --> 22:41.098
there will be a warning,
and my contortion field

22:41.142 --> 22:43.274
will portal them here,
and we will finish this.

22:48.323 --> 22:49.455
Now.

23:00.335 --> 23:01.945
Sorry I'm late.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.034
Elder Robinson, it's you.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.732
We were getting worried.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.474
Good. You should be.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.999
Oh, God.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.000
Miss me?

23:13.043 --> 23:14.088
ELDER SILVER:
Kill him now!

23:15.437 --> 23:17.396
ELDERS:
Solaris Incantatio!

23:51.342 --> 23:53.040
Help!

23:55.869 --> 23:58.045
Harry! Elder Silver.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.307
HUNTER:
You can't hold me forever!

23:59.350 --> 24:01.004
Come on.Just go!

24:01.048 --> 24:02.702
She's the only sage left.

24:07.097 --> 24:10.187
Uh-oh. Your poor
Whitelighter's gone.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.146
No way out now, witches.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.930
This is for Niko!

24:15.105 --> 24:16.193
Mel!

24:23.940 --> 24:25.725
How is she?

24:25.768 --> 24:27.727
She'll live.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.381
But we've got to seal the house
before he tries to return.

24:30.425 --> 24:33.559
Find every protection spell
in the Bookand use it at once.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.304
They're dead.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.045
They're all dead.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.395
Yes, but we're not,
and neither is she.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.006
So let's get to work.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.583
MACY:
We should have
seen that coming.

24:57.626 --> 25:01.064
We couldn't have known Hunter
was the one killing Elders.

25:01.108 --> 25:04.764
Seems to have learned
some new tricks in Tartarus.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.896
We need to figure out
how he got so powerful.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.898
That's the only way
we can stop him.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.075
Where are you going?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.860
To get Elder Bari's needle.

25:15.035 --> 25:18.429
I need to tap into Hunter
and see his demonic motives.

25:18.473 --> 25:21.041
Macy, wait.No, there's no time.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.738
My demon side is the
only thing standing

25:22.782 --> 25:24.392
between us and the apocalypse.

25:24.435 --> 25:27.003
You do realize you're starting
to sound like a demon, right?

25:27.047 --> 25:28.396
Excuse me?MAGGIE: The Macy we know

25:28.439 --> 25:29.832
would never make this
all about her.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.051
You haven't known me that long.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.356
Long enough to know
that you're getting

25:32.400 --> 25:34.489
really dependent
on your demon side.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.751
I am not.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.971
Macy, your eyes
and your voice are changing.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.015
It's the needle, Macy.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.322
Every time you use it,
you get worse.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.064
I couldn't save the Sarcana
or Tessa,

25:44.107 --> 25:45.718
but I can still save you.

25:46.936 --> 25:47.894
No...!

25:52.986 --> 25:54.640
MAGGIE:
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.119
Mel?

25:56.163 --> 25:59.601
Stop holding me back.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.908
Macy.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.170
Macy!

26:07.087 --> 26:09.045
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.No.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.612
Mel? Oh, no.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.874
No.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.006
Are you okay?

26:13.049 --> 26:14.964
Oh, my... I'm sorry.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.576
I could have killed you.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.490
Come on.
Let's get you up.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.997
I love you.

26:48.041 --> 26:50.957
I love you, too.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.177
Both of you.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.136
Come on. Come on.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.791
Let's... sit you down.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.805
The book nook.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.329
Like Mom always said.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.984
Yeah.

27:18.027 --> 27:21.074
It's almost like
she knew all along.

27:24.338 --> 27:25.513
Maybe she did.

27:32.912 --> 27:35.001
Huh.

27:35.044 --> 27:38.526
It's just like the moon
and stars I've been doodling.

27:41.747 --> 27:45.576
Please open
a secret passageway.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.932
Oh.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.850
I just figured with all the
secrets Mom left in the house...

28:00.940 --> 28:02.942
Hey, there's another.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.222
Macy, there's one for you.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.725
I knew it.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.690
Look.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.741
Our names.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.495
Mom.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.671
My brilliant,
beautiful daughters,

29:20.715 --> 29:23.500
if you're seeing this, it means
the three of you are together.

29:23.544 --> 29:26.025
But prophecy
will only take you so far.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.505
What kind of mother would I be,
sending you into this battle

29:28.549 --> 29:30.464
without the weapons
you need to win?

29:30.507 --> 29:32.292
Maggie,

29:32.335 --> 29:35.556
by now you must realize
how powerful your emotions are

29:35.599 --> 29:37.688
and how difficult it can be
to harness them.

29:39.212 --> 29:40.430
This staff

29:40.474 --> 29:42.519
will help you focus
your emotional energy

29:42.563 --> 29:43.956
when you need it most.

29:45.871 --> 29:49.091
Mel, time is tricky, isn't it?

29:49.135 --> 29:50.876
The challenge
is in knowing

29:50.919 --> 29:52.007
how much or how little

29:52.051 --> 29:53.661
to manipulate time
to your advantage.

29:53.704 --> 29:54.880
This bracelet

29:54.923 --> 29:56.707
will allow you to speed up

29:56.751 --> 29:59.014
or slow down
your movements through time.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.450
Very useful when an enemy

30:00.494 --> 30:01.625
can't be frozen.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.933
Macy...

30:04.977 --> 30:08.023
because of your power,
the world is your weapon.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.852
So I don't have any gifts
for you today.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.550
But on your tenth birthday,
your father

30:13.594 --> 30:15.988
gave you a special
yin and yang pendant.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.555
It's a symbol
of balance and harmony

30:18.599 --> 30:20.862
between two opposing sides.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.777
And any time
you feel yourself being pulled

30:22.821 --> 30:25.388
towards the darkness,
all you need to do is touch it

30:25.432 --> 30:26.476
and exhale.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.914
It will bring you back
to your sisters,

30:28.957 --> 30:31.481
even in your darkest hours.

30:31.525 --> 30:34.093
So, I leave you these tools

30:34.136 --> 30:36.356
and the skills
with which to use them--

30:36.399 --> 30:37.879
no training necessary.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.316
But they will never be
your greatest weapon.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.405
As I've always said,

30:42.449 --> 30:44.494
you're better together.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.366
Your differences
are your strengths.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.976
And nothing

30:48.020 --> 30:50.457
is stronger than
your sisterhood.

Hey, Luce, tell your girl Maggie
to get her ass down here.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.778
What up, amigo?

31:50.821 --> 31:53.737
I need your face in my life,
like, yesterday.Lucy...

31:53.781 --> 31:55.435
Also, I don't know
who your friend is, but one,

31:55.478 --> 31:57.654
is he single? And C,
should I make out with him?

31:59.004 --> 32:00.831
Lucy. No, wait, listen to me.

32:00.875 --> 32:03.878
If you want her alive,

HARRY:
I still don't

32:20.939 --> 32:21.765
feel good about this,
using you as bait.

32:21.809 --> 32:22.984
We should be protecting you.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.681
He's expecting me, Harry.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.031
And he's the reason

32:26.074 --> 32:28.076
all my friends are dead.

35:13.894 --> 35:17.289
Today, it feels

one step closer

35:35.698 --> 35:38.962
to putting the Source in Parker.

35:39.006 --> 35:42.662
We'll find him first, Maggie.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.881
Together.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.710
And if we don't,

35:47.754 --> 35:51.453

You are so much more powerful

You and I can take him on
together, leave this...

36:22.702 --> 36:25.095
Too late for that, sister.

36:27.272 --> 36:30.405
I'm done running.

36:30.449 --> 36:33.060
I had another vessel in mind

36:33.103 --> 36:35.062
when I went looking
for the Origin Dagger.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.631
But I suppose
Parker will have to do.

36:38.674 --> 36:40.198
I-I don't understand.

36:40.241 --> 36:44.114
Why would you want a demon
to take on the Source?

36:44.158 --> 36:45.942
Because as soon as he's filled
with all that raw power,

36:45.986 --> 36:46.987
I'm going to kill him...

36:48.641 --> 36:51.209
...and destroy magic forever.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.081
You can't be serious.

36:54.124 --> 36:56.257
Destroy magic?

36:56.301 --> 36:58.520
That would be the end
for all of us.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.699
Why are you telling me all this?

37:03.743 --> 37:05.658
'Cause there's
one thing

37:05.701 --> 37:08.095
Alistair didn't know
when he dispatched Hunter

37:08.138 --> 37:10.967
to kill those sages.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.970
There's one more left.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.538
I'm still a sage.

37:21.021 --> 37:26.592
The Prophecy can't happen

calls based on the cell towers

37:41.259 --> 37:43.086
they pinged when calling
into Lucy's account.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.219
You are a
CSI-level genius.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.395
Everything you need to find
your boyfriend should in here.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.580
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.324
Hey.
Hey.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.371
So we should talk
about what happened.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.895
There's something
that I have to tell you.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.853
Mel, don't.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.202
Please.

38:17.469 --> 38:21.473
A few months ago, I erased
your memory because a demon

38:21.516 --> 38:23.039
was after you.

38:23.083 --> 38:26.739
Your life was in
jeopardy because of me.

38:26.782 --> 38:30.612
So I rewrote history
so that you and I never met.

38:30.656 --> 38:33.833
That shift,
that trauma

38:33.876 --> 38:37.402
that you keep talking about that
happened to you two years ago?

38:37.445 --> 38:39.360
We were together.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.362
And you left
Greta for me

38:41.406 --> 38:43.408
because you were unhappy.

38:43.451 --> 38:46.672
And then we-we were... happy.

38:46.715 --> 38:51.981
And now I see how unhappy you
are with Greta, and I love you.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.332
Stop.

38:54.375 --> 38:58.553
Are you telling me that
you used magic to alter my life?

39:00.163 --> 39:02.122
Yes.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.863
You're not God, Mel!

39:03.906 --> 39:06.169
Do you even know what the hell
I went through?

39:06.213 --> 39:07.736
I thought I was losing my mind!

39:07.780 --> 39:11.436
Because you made
choices for me.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.263
But I did it to save you.No.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.788
You did it for yourself.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.833
So you could sleep
better at night.No.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.531
No.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.325
I take it you heard that?

39:32.805 --> 39:34.763
I'm sorry, Mel.

39:34.807 --> 39:37.026
Can I tell you something?

39:43.163 --> 39:45.165
Sometimes I am jealous of you.

39:47.602 --> 39:50.823
You are so brilliant.

39:50.866 --> 39:53.521
You're fearless.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.218
The way you use
your dark side to help us,
