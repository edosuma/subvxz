00:02.635 --> 00:04.346
- You gonna hide.
- Puttin' him on the run?

00:04.468 --> 00:06.757
- I can't run.
- Right now it's about keeping ya alive.

00:06.878 --> 00:08.798
You've got history
with these grenade tossers.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.912
The guy with the grenades
is named Guardo.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.580
We hit him hard and his weapons stash,
but he got away.

00:13.729 --> 00:14.968
He screwed my ex-wife.

00:15.114 --> 00:16.152
Sole purpose...

00:16.300 --> 00:19.762
making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

00:20.148 --> 00:22.630
He may have assassinated
a gang leader.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.040
This was not
part of the deal.

00:24.173 --> 00:26.323
Sure it was.
The part Antwon didn't tell you about.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.818
This was a calculated move
by Lieutenant Kavanaugh

00:28.969 --> 00:30.961
to put Curtis' life
in jeopardy

00:31.175 --> 00:33.251
to compel him to testify
against his team.

00:33.396 --> 00:35.871
My client is willing
to plead to new charges,

00:36.006 --> 00:38.120
as long as we can reasonably
guarantee his safety.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.062
What does he have to say
about his friends?

00:40.218 --> 00:42.101
Nothing.
There is one other option, though.

00:42.258 --> 00:44.041
I can't turn on my family.

00:44.316 --> 00:47.572
We're gonna lose
a vast chance at nailing Vic.

00:47.737 --> 00:50.371
You got to make him believe
that Lemansky gave it up

00:50.527 --> 00:51.670
for witness protection.

00:51.858 --> 00:52.862
Lemansky's talking.

00:53.018 --> 00:54.791
Now all this bullshit
can blow back on me.

00:54.925 --> 00:57.041
If he had a change of heart,
he would've tipped us.

00:57.185 --> 00:59.030
He wouldn't if his deal
meant us going down.

00:59.168 --> 01:01.200
We go to the spot and
we'll take his temperature.

01:01.337 --> 01:03.183
If he doesn't show,
assume he made the deal.

01:03.315 --> 01:04.962
We got to wait
until you get to Mexico.

01:05.084 --> 01:06.853
We got money parked in
an account for you.

01:06.997 --> 01:09.031
- It's all set up.
- I'm not going that route.

01:09.176 --> 01:11.951
Why did you even come back here
if you weren't planning on leaving?

01:12.098 --> 01:13.112
I came to see you guys.

01:13.257 --> 01:14.400
I brought you some food.

01:17.358 --> 01:18.350
Shane.

01:23.165 --> 01:25.341
Are you happy, Detective Mackey?

01:29.065 --> 01:30.070
Break 'em up.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.592
We gonna find out who did this.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.031
And we gonna kill him.

No one's seen Guardo.
He's a god damn ghost.

02:55.298 --> 02:56.703
Anything south of the border?

02:56.825 --> 02:59.401
Our federale is neck-deep
in some prison beef.

02:59.525 --> 03:00.531
Couldn't help.

03:04.998 --> 03:07.201
How did Guardo get Lem
to show up at that place?

03:08.298 --> 03:09.302
Alone.

03:14.326 --> 03:15.863
And the way he died.

03:16.865 --> 03:17.862
Shit.

03:24.317 --> 03:25.400
We find Guardo...

03:27.085 --> 03:28.451
He dies the same way.

03:30.836 --> 03:31.851
Only slower.

03:33.978 --> 03:35.002
Yeah. He will.

03:38.226 --> 03:40.160
If only he'd reach out
to us instead of Becca.

03:40.396 --> 03:42.521
- He should've trusted us man.
- He was scared.

03:43.726 --> 03:45.653
If I didn't let the whole thing
with Antwon go

03:45.817 --> 03:47.723
- shit-side up...
- Hey, it's nobody's fault.

03:59.946 --> 04:01.211
You were a great cop.

04:02.338 --> 04:03.413
You were a great friend.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.092

very seriously.

04:44.797 --> 04:46.101
Another homicide
volunteer?

04:46.247 --> 04:48.812
It's the third el salvadoran
to confess to Lemansky's murder.

04:48.975 --> 04:50.580
First two didn't get one detail right.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.910
This guy wasn't even in the country
when it happened.

04:53.465 --> 04:54.820
Guy turns himself in,

04:54.957 --> 04:56.760
takes the prison juice for the killing,

04:56.896 --> 04:58.041
keeps the heat off the gang.

04:58.178 --> 05:00.093
Heat? What heat?
I haven't heard a peep

05:00.246 --> 05:01.241
out of downtown.

05:01.396 --> 05:03.101
No police funeral.
No press conference.

05:03.296 --> 05:04.873
It's like Lemansky
never wore a badge.

05:05.078 --> 05:06.572
He's ready
to be processed.

05:11.917 --> 05:14.482
- Vic check in yet?
- No. I'll get this.

05:18.015 --> 05:21.473
Hey, is Vic around?
I can't get him on the phone.

05:21.617 --> 05:24.323
No. He's still taking
some personal time.

05:24.456 --> 05:26.291
He's not supposed
to be back until tomorrow.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.431
Is everything OK?

05:27.565 --> 05:28.960
I haven't heard from him in days.

05:29.258 --> 05:32.231
I leave messages.
He doesn't get back to me.

05:32.387 --> 05:33.440
The kids are freaking out.

05:33.597 --> 05:36.271
Well, I'm sure he's
just sorting things out.

05:37.118 --> 05:38.120
Yeah.

05:38.268 --> 05:39.681
I'll get a message to him.

05:39.968 --> 05:40.960
Have him call me.

05:42.137 --> 05:43.143
Thanks.

05:48.296 --> 05:50.513
A.C., sorry to startle you.

05:50.787 --> 05:52.250
Can I get a minute of your time?

05:53.635 --> 05:54.732
What now, Lieutenant?

05:55.548 --> 05:57.713
I just wanna apologize
for my behavior last week

05:57.878 --> 05:58.923
in Captain Wyms' office.

05:59.925 --> 06:01.912
It was out of line.
I let it get too personal.

06:02.047 --> 06:03.053
Yeah, you did.

06:03.916 --> 06:05.922
I've been doing a lot of soul searching

06:06.058 --> 06:07.731
in the light of Lemansky's death,

06:08.557 --> 06:09.763
trying to locate my motives.

06:09.907 --> 06:11.053
Motives for what?

06:13.605 --> 06:14.602
For finding his killer.

06:14.756 --> 06:15.762
That's not your job.

06:16.347 --> 06:18.463
Wyms' office is in charge
of that investigation.

06:18.896 --> 06:21.883
I know. And Wagenbach, he's a good man.

06:22.505 --> 06:25.191
But he's only looking at this
from the Salvadoran angle.

06:25.335 --> 06:26.393
What do you want, Jon?

06:26.535 --> 06:27.833
Same thing I wanted last week.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.893
Not gonna happen. You
can't see the line anymore.

06:31.106 --> 06:33.773
Nobody can see the line.
Mackey just keeps moving it.

06:34.206 --> 06:36.772
Please. I just need...
You need a time for a dead cop.

06:37.635 --> 06:38.680
He deserves that.

06:42.688 --> 06:44.451
Okay. What is it?

06:45.785 --> 06:48.900
The brick of tar
that we found on Lemansky

06:49.507 --> 06:52.172
was a part of something dirty
that Vic put into motion.

06:53.628 --> 06:54.843
When Curtis got caught,

06:55.767 --> 06:57.762
Vic need to protect himself.

06:57.925 --> 06:59.853
So he let Lemansky take the plea

07:00.466 --> 07:02.600
while he brokered a deal
with Antwon Mitchell

07:03.233 --> 07:04.620
for his guy's safety in the joint.

07:05.363 --> 07:07.073
But the Mitchell deal went bad.

07:08.284 --> 07:10.148
Curtis, he panicked,
on the run.

07:11.459 --> 07:13.461
Vic knew that this guy was gonna crack,

07:13.806 --> 07:16.352
- That curtis was gonna
- Mackey killed his own guy?

07:16.516 --> 07:19.711
More than likely, he cut a
deal with the Salvadorans.

07:19.875 --> 07:22.801
But somebody put that grenade
in Lemansky's lap.

07:23.307 --> 07:25.031
And Vic, he knows who did it.

07:25.675 --> 07:28.073
Let Wagenbach follow
the Salvadoran trail.

07:28.575 --> 07:29.793
Let me look into Vic.

07:30.026 --> 07:31.021
Discreet.

07:31.197 --> 07:32.221
Respectful.

07:34.975 --> 07:37.070
I want your report end of day tomorrow.

07:38.076 --> 07:39.840
We'll decide if it
makes sense to pursue.

07:40.497 --> 07:41.502
You'll have it.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.502
Thank you, sir.

07:59.258 --> 08:00.632
There's nothing new on Lem.

08:00.918 --> 08:03.512
We've been spending more time
knocking down false confessions.

08:03.688 --> 08:05.513
It's all a smokescreen.
It's Guardo.

08:05.955 --> 08:08.021
We stepped on his drug
protection play twice.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.501
Killing Lem was a message to stay away.

08:10.818 --> 08:12.141
Been waiting on you.

08:12.915 --> 08:14.860
Water street
methadone clinic got torched.

08:15.047 --> 08:16.042
Go check that out.

08:16.268 --> 08:17.790
We're not arson patrol.

08:18.057 --> 08:20.513
Well, it's a drug rehab
in a heavy gang area.

08:21.488 --> 08:23.741
I can't sign off on you
working Lem's murder.

08:24.135 --> 08:26.400
Take a step back.
Focus on something else.

08:26.766 --> 08:28.671
If we find something out,
we'll let you know.

08:28.957 --> 08:31.842
Hey, um, Corrine was here last night.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.171
She hadn't heard from you.
The kids were worried.

08:34.317 --> 08:35.400
Maybe you should call her.

08:38.106 --> 08:39.113
Right.

08:45.408 --> 08:46.410
Shit. Split. Split.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.561
Hey!

08:49.715 --> 08:50.752
Hey!

08:50.897 --> 08:51.912
Turn that shit off.

08:52.735 --> 08:53.732
Come here.

08:54.558 --> 08:56.132
How's Antwon's favorite errand bitch?

08:56.448 --> 08:57.500
- You got a need?
- Yeah.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.630
To do this.

09:03.935 --> 09:05.620
Damn, I got left overs older than you.

09:06.198 --> 09:07.902
Yeah, but not as tasty.

09:09.676 --> 09:12.111
Hey, looks like Moses finally made it

09:12.248 --> 09:14.033
to the land of milk and underage honey.

09:14.476 --> 09:16.580
- She legal.
- And all kind of willin'.

09:17.368 --> 09:18.371
Vic.

09:19.197 --> 09:20.200
Goddamn!

09:20.837 --> 09:22.272
Looks like business has been good.

09:23.006 --> 09:24.022
No thanks to you.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.340
Goddamn empty safe.

09:27.745 --> 09:30.162
Looks like your daddy
might have a broken sugar, darlin'.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.590
You wanna get off
the dead-banger's list,

09:35.958 --> 09:37.350
you learn to play
by the rules.

09:37.497 --> 09:39.940
The first one is,
we still make the rules.

09:41.838 --> 09:44.882
Burnt-out clinic on water.
That's a 1-9er block.

09:45.165 --> 09:47.123
Looks like you guys
might be holding the match.

09:47.278 --> 09:49.160
- We got no beef with the methadonians.
- No.

09:49.286 --> 09:50.292
They good business.

09:50.427 --> 09:52.273
How's them climbing
off the horse help you?

09:53.306 --> 09:55.241
What we lose in h
we gain in benzos.

09:55.627 --> 09:57.361
Some of them junkies
drop 10 tabs a day.

09:57.507 --> 09:59.870
- Clinic knows that's going on?
- They don't give a shit.

09:59.998 --> 10:01.111
Getting clean's big money.

10:02.005 --> 10:04.622
Turns those street junkies
into state-sponsored ones.

10:04.846 --> 10:05.840
Hell, yeah.

10:05.975 --> 10:08.342
Some of them zombies been
on the m-dose 20 goddamn years.

10:09.698 --> 10:10.703
Shit.

10:11.467 --> 10:12.810
Get a hold of the torched clinic.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.082
See if anybody violent's
trying to kick their dose.

10:15.217 --> 10:16.312
Someone on the jones?

10:16.506 --> 10:19.042
Hurting. Delusional.
I'd be setting fires.

10:20.388 --> 10:23.390
Call Wyms. Have her post unis
at all the methadone facilities.

10:24.098 --> 10:26.262
You, tell your fearless leader

10:26.408 --> 10:28.562
he ever needs a favor,
he shouldn't hesitate to call.

10:30.778 --> 10:31.773
I owe him one.

10:36.248 --> 10:39.142
Clinic said Quentin garth's been doing
the home-study methadone kick.

10:39.268 --> 10:40.823
This idiot's lowering
his own dosage?

10:40.955 --> 10:41.953
Down to 30 mils.

10:42.077 --> 10:44.703
Volatile, raging about how
he's being screwed by big medicine.

10:44.825 --> 10:45.821
Threatened a counselor.

10:45.955 --> 10:49.000
Lives here with his best friend.
No one's seen either of them for 2 days.

10:59.588 --> 11:00.612
Kitchen's clear.

11:02.887 --> 11:04.233
- Bedroom's clear.
- Looks like

11:04.358 --> 11:05.943
Quentin's seen some time in the desert.

11:06.078 --> 11:07.692
Probably where he
picked up his habit.

11:07.898 --> 11:08.902
You smell that?

11:09.848 --> 11:10.843
Yeah.

11:15.465 --> 11:17.220
Smells like burnt toast.

11:21.626 --> 11:23.413
Kevin Smith.
The roommate.

11:23.588 --> 11:25.692
Cracked his skull open.
Went through his wallet.

11:25.816 --> 11:26.821
Left him for dead.

11:27.488 --> 11:29.033
I'm glad this guy's
his best friend.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.033
I'd hate to see what
he'd do to his enemies.

11:43.468 --> 11:45.751
Thank you.
Got anything new on the Lemansky murder?

11:47.027 --> 11:48.020
N-- No.

11:54.068 --> 11:56.302
Uh, I called you actually.

11:56.427 --> 11:58.993
Is there any way to get in touch
with your el Salvadoran C.I.?

11:59.395 --> 12:01.393
Emolia?
What do you wanna talk to her for?

12:01.718 --> 12:02.863
Guardo's my lead suspect.

12:02.997 --> 12:05.523
She's seen him, knows that world.
Maybe she's got a pipeline.

12:07.116 --> 12:08.433
She talked about...

12:08.737 --> 12:10.282
Going to seattle...

12:10.425 --> 12:11.433
Be with her sister.

12:11.596 --> 12:13.451
I really don't know
where she is right now.

12:13.916 --> 12:15.492
Um, you parking here?

12:16.087 --> 12:18.100
- I thought your investigation was over.
- It is.

12:18.257 --> 12:19.491
I'm opening a new one

12:19.905 --> 12:21.523
in conjunction
with Lemansky's death.

12:22.248 --> 12:24.590
I'm creating a timeline
for my lead suspect.

12:26.605 --> 12:27.612
Who is that?

12:27.946 --> 12:30.083
This is footage from
the city and freeway cams

12:30.207 --> 12:31.951
on the night that Lemansky was murdered.

12:32.215 --> 12:34.432
In his voluntary statement
given the next morning,

12:34.837 --> 12:35.990
Mackey said :

12:36.685 --> 12:38.052
"It was
too late to see my kids,

12:38.198 --> 12:40.592
so I hopped on the 10.

12:41.165 --> 12:42.673
Headed towards the coast highway.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.341
That drive always clears my head."

12:45.186 --> 12:47.272
You're establishing
a timeline for Vic

12:47.408 --> 12:48.592
on the night of the murder?

12:50.575 --> 12:51.580
Yeah.

12:53.507 --> 12:54.622
Look...

12:56.165 --> 12:59.700
Lemansky and Mackey
were extraordinarily tight.

13:00.007 --> 13:01.300
Plus you've got no motive.

13:03.688 --> 13:04.691
Here's the thing, man.

13:07.005 --> 13:09.971
I had Aceveda tell Mackey

13:10.527 --> 13:11.950
that Lem was cutting a deal,

13:12.486 --> 13:16.762
that he was giving up Vic
and his team for immunity.

13:18.318 --> 13:21.231
I knew that Mackey would go to Curtis

13:21.695 --> 13:23.032
to try to find out the truth.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.421
So we were gonna tail him,
get him on aiding and abetting.

13:27.257 --> 13:29.572
But Vic and his guys, they shook up.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.763
A couple of hours later,
I see him standing over

13:32.895 --> 13:33.900
Lemansky's body.

13:34.776 --> 13:36.232
Jesus Christ.

13:36.428 --> 13:39.213
Maybe it wasn't mackey.
Maybe he couldn't do it.

13:40.218 --> 13:41.210
But he needed it done.

13:41.818 --> 13:44.092
He had Lem killed.
Because I gave him up.

13:46.718 --> 13:48.561
All right, let's get
an apb out on Quentin.

13:48.888 --> 13:50.722
Ex-military.
Probably has guns.

13:50.848 --> 13:52.303
Let's track down family members,

13:52.538 --> 13:53.533
drug dealers.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.043
And let's ask our clinic guy...

13:56.998 --> 13:58.013
What's up?

13:58.156 --> 13:59.152
What?

14:00.588 --> 14:01.591
Have you seen this?

14:10.527 --> 14:12.701
Claudette, you knew about this shit?

14:12.888 --> 14:13.893
I read it.

14:14.028 --> 14:15.843
Lem gave 12 years to this department.

14:16.127 --> 14:17.393
God knows how many arrests.

14:17.525 --> 14:19.851
Never saw his picture
in the paper once for any of that.

14:19.975 --> 14:22.760
The reporter got wind of facts
and brass couldn't control the spin.

14:22.898 --> 14:23.901
That's bullshit.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.743
Johnson's been looking for a corruption
goat since he made chief.

14:26.927 --> 14:28.191
He pinned
the horns on Lem.

14:28.338 --> 14:30.322
It's a shitty ending
to an ugly story.

14:30.445 --> 14:31.890
And with the bad cop buried,

14:32.256 --> 14:34.253
you and the Department
get a fresh start, right?

14:34.558 --> 14:36.500
What happened to Lemansky
was an awful thing.

14:36.655 --> 14:38.191
I'm sorry. But he made the choice

14:38.328 --> 14:40.113
to stash the heroin in his car.

14:40.248 --> 14:41.560
He made the choice to run.

14:41.717 --> 14:44.390
Kavanaugh browbeat
that admission on him.

14:44.605 --> 14:46.903
Then he threatened to dump him
in Antwon's bottom bunk.

14:47.047 --> 14:48.362
He ran because he was scared.

14:48.487 --> 14:50.033
He forced Lem to make another deal.

14:51.498 --> 14:52.670
What are you talking about?

14:55.805 --> 14:58.223
Becca said that Lem made a second deal

14:58.377 --> 14:59.681
with Kavanaugh and the chief.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.143
The only way Lemansky
would make another deal

15:02.295 --> 15:04.851
was if he turned in other
dirty cops, and he didn't.

15:05.745 --> 15:06.750
What?

15:07.128 --> 15:08.120
It was the same deal.

15:08.795 --> 15:10.131
He was willing to do more time

15:10.275 --> 15:12.200
if I.A.D. could assure him
they'd keep him out

15:12.337 --> 15:13.520
of Antwon's reach.

15:13.977 --> 15:15.610
He was killed before it went through.

15:15.747 --> 15:16.742
No.

15:17.025 --> 15:19.893
Police council is making a
formal statement this evening.

15:20.555 --> 15:22.413
We'll be as respectful as we can.

15:24.596 --> 15:25.590
Let me guess.

15:26.535 --> 15:28.150
That respectful face is Aceveda's.

15:28.288 --> 15:29.281
What do you think?

15:34.667 --> 15:38.030
Aceveda said that Lem gave us up,

15:38.178 --> 15:41.362
that he told him
about the money train.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.861
Kavanaugh must've heard a rumor,

15:43.077 --> 15:45.632
had his wetback bitch
feed it to us, put us in motion.

15:45.798 --> 15:47.373
And we goddamn ate it up.

15:49.506 --> 15:51.360
Made me think
my own guy turned on me.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.251
Hey, Julian, what the hell
is Kavanaugh doing here?

15:57.857 --> 16:00.171
Heard he's working
Lemansky's murder with Dutch.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.183
According to his visa stamp,

16:18.418 --> 16:20.571
Rene arrived in L.A. 18 hours after

16:20.716 --> 16:22.062
Lemansky was killed.

16:36.077 --> 16:38.972
He says he's got 2 cousins
who saw him kill Lemansky.

16:40.337 --> 16:42.380
Um, cousins got addresses?

16:46.665 --> 16:47.671
He doesn't know.

16:47.806 --> 16:48.803
Right.

16:48.996 --> 16:50.090
I need a minute with you.

16:51.425 --> 16:52.443
Okay.

16:53.575 --> 16:56.500
Run the cousins'
names through I.N.S., DMV.

16:56.635 --> 16:57.900
See if you can find addresses.

17:07.237 --> 17:08.962
Kavanaugh's working Lem's murder?

17:09.976 --> 17:11.622
An angle of it,
and it's not my choice.

17:11.756 --> 17:12.761
Which angle?

17:13.608 --> 17:15.462
He didn't really go into any detail.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.731
Don't dick me around, Dutchman.

17:21.715 --> 17:22.713
You're the angle.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.593
Oh, hey. Oh, I'm sorry.

17:51.808 --> 17:53.751
That's OK.
I was just taking a minute.

17:54.228 --> 17:55.253
Oh, my God.

17:55.955 --> 17:57.662
Wow. He's big.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.940
He's beefy and happy.

18:01.905 --> 18:03.033
You mind if, uh...

18:03.538 --> 18:04.562
No. Okay. Sure.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.713
Hey. It's OK.

18:08.536 --> 18:10.543
I just had to take care
of some insurance stuff,

18:10.675 --> 18:12.021
so I thought I'd show him off.

18:14.756 --> 18:15.791
He's beautiful, Danielle.

18:16.255 --> 18:17.261
Thanks.

18:20.485 --> 18:21.531
- See you.
- Yeah.

18:23.577 --> 18:24.573
Say bye.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.670
Let's go inside.
Come on.

18:40.128 --> 18:42.542
I guess I should start making
my funeral arrangements now.

18:42.675 --> 18:43.673
Right, Lieutenant?

18:43.796 --> 18:45.012
Why would you wanna do that?

18:45.187 --> 18:47.960
Seems like every cop
you investigate ends up dead.

18:48.886 --> 18:50.082
I'm not at liberty to discuss

18:50.216 --> 18:52.000
the details
of my investigation with you.

18:52.286 --> 18:53.711
You get my best friend blown up.

18:54.215 --> 18:55.330
You come into my house.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.271
You hang your mistake
and your guilt on me.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.411
Detail enough?

18:58.858 --> 19:00.493
I know this must be the grief talking.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.353
At what point do your bosses realize

19:02.488 --> 19:04.560
you're as delusional
as that sick, crazy,

19:04.695 --> 19:06.060
twisted ex-wife of yours?

19:06.195 --> 19:09.052
I guess the same time that yours realize
that you've murdered two...

19:09.186 --> 19:10.582
of your own team members.

19:16.037 --> 19:17.473
Mackey! Kavanaugh!

19:19.688 --> 19:21.831
Knock it off! Knock it off!

19:21.978 --> 19:23.212
- Get your hands off.
- Now!

19:28.558 --> 19:30.863
Jesus. I got a goddamn lump.

19:38.508 --> 19:39.551
What the hell was that?

19:39.698 --> 19:40.693
It's not the first time.

19:40.836 --> 19:43.132
He and Mackey went at it
at Lemansky's crime scene.

19:43.288 --> 19:44.930
Took 9 unis to break it up.

19:45.565 --> 19:46.951
This is you being discreet?

19:47.695 --> 19:49.541
Mackey advanced on me both times.

19:49.676 --> 19:51.101
It was self-defense. You saw that.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.880
I.A.D.'s supposed to be
the objective eyes of the department.

19:54.028 --> 19:56.492
Objectivity doesn't lead to brawls
and pissing matches.

19:56.647 --> 19:57.772
I don't need that report.

19:57.928 --> 19:59.723
You're done with Mackey.
You're off of this.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.632
Get your ass out of the barn

20:01.756 --> 20:04.870
before I hit you
with an insubordination beef.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.770
Okay, look, stop.

20:13.235 --> 20:15.823
I have proof that Vic
had Lemansky killed.

20:19.476 --> 20:20.490
I do.

20:23.017 --> 20:24.022
What proof?

20:25.147 --> 20:26.183
Emolia Melendez.

20:27.388 --> 20:29.553
Vic used her to get a message
to the el Salvadorans.

20:29.805 --> 20:32.853
She set up Lem's murder for Vic.

20:37.596 --> 20:40.721
You told Dutch that you
didn't know where she was.

20:40.845 --> 20:42.611
I don't. She called me.
She was terrified.

20:42.737 --> 20:44.990
Maybe she was trying
to create another revenue source.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.171
Is there anything this woman
won't say for a buck?

20:48.375 --> 20:49.793
Mackey threatened her kid.

20:50.487 --> 20:53.111
She was terrified.
She had no choice, all right?

20:53.248 --> 20:54.563
Just bringing this to us now?

20:54.697 --> 20:57.753
I've seen Mackey slip out of every
noose that we've had around his neck.

20:58.078 --> 21:00.211
I don't even know who to
trust around here anymore.

21:00.366 --> 21:02.152
I mean, you gave me
to the end of the day,

21:02.365 --> 21:04.391
and I was just trying
to put the pieces together

21:04.538 --> 21:05.823
before I brought them to you.

21:10.245 --> 21:12.330
Let's bring her in.
Let's hear her.

21:14.658 --> 21:15.671
All right.

21:15.817 --> 21:19.283
I have D.A. gave us some leads
to where Emolia might be.

21:19.456 --> 21:21.343
Dutch is out there writing them down.

21:22.936 --> 21:25.120
Okay. I'll give him a call.

21:29.425 --> 21:31.672
Emolia, it's Jon. Jon Kavanaugh.

21:33.987 --> 21:35.383
What the hell are you doing here?

21:35.698 --> 21:36.712
You alone?

21:36.875 --> 21:38.773
Sebastio's at my mom's. Why?

21:40.438 --> 21:42.503
The detective said he
wasn't coming here, right?

21:43.038 --> 21:44.331
No. What's the matter?

21:45.597 --> 21:46.603
No toys.

21:47.605 --> 21:49.631
Sebastio's spending all
this time at your mom's?

21:49.767 --> 21:50.960
Yeah. He's safe there.

21:52.105 --> 21:53.103
What are you afraid of?

21:54.797 --> 21:56.251
I snitched on Guardo.

21:56.838 --> 21:59.360
People know.
They want me dead.

22:00.436 --> 22:01.430
What about Vic?

22:02.427 --> 22:03.630
He hasn't got your back now?

22:03.775 --> 22:05.330
Vic ain't shit for me.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.740
Not taking care of you anymore?

22:06.935 --> 22:10.360
Him and his guys shit all over me.
Called Sebastio a retard.

22:10.618 --> 22:12.753
That's wrong.
I'm sorry about that.

22:14.685 --> 22:16.363
But I have a way to make things right.

22:24.317 --> 22:25.311
Jesus.

22:25.818 --> 22:27.240
Lem didn't rat.

22:28.596 --> 22:31.002
You made me believe
my own guy turned on me.

22:33.076 --> 22:34.820
I have people waiting in my office.

22:35.385 --> 22:37.353
You were in bed with
Kavanaugh the whole time.

22:38.876 --> 22:41.331
Kavanaugh played us both.
Squeezed me, too.

22:42.098 --> 22:43.700
- I had no choice.
- Bullshit.

22:44.566 --> 22:46.631
Your jones to hurt me
let you turn a blind eye

22:46.807 --> 22:48.251
at what he was doing to Lem.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.111
You knew about the Antwon threat.

22:51.587 --> 22:52.850
That scare
put him on the run,

22:53.257 --> 22:54.262
got him killed.

22:54.557 --> 22:55.912
What, so it's my fault?

22:58.078 --> 23:00.111
When do you ever take
responsibility, Vic?

23:00.547 --> 23:02.192
When is anything your fault?

23:02.327 --> 23:05.051
If you weren't a heartbeat away
from being forced out right now...

23:05.185 --> 23:07.182
What? You'd take my badge?

23:07.416 --> 23:08.412
Go ahead.

23:09.795 --> 23:11.373
Is that what you and Kavanaugh want?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.510
Take it all.

23:12.848 --> 23:13.840
Here.

23:14.507 --> 23:15.501
Take it.

23:16.448 --> 23:17.993
What the hell are you doing?

23:18.125 --> 23:20.900
You wanna end a career,
you do it straight up

23:21.366 --> 23:22.710
to someone who's still alive.

23:23.015 --> 23:24.950
Who could still
look you right in the eye.

23:28.358 --> 23:29.963
I'm sorry about Lem.

23:34.295 --> 23:35.601
Then don't disgrace him.

23:37.395 --> 23:38.671
You know, it's not my fault.

23:40.068 --> 23:41.371
It's not my call.

23:42.677 --> 23:44.373
I'm just the face of the decision.

24:02.618 --> 24:05.910
I say that Vic used me as a middleman

24:06.057 --> 24:07.630
to set up the hit on his guy.

24:08.186 --> 24:09.201
Yes.

24:09.367 --> 24:10.512
He had it all planned out.

24:11.076 --> 24:13.563
Give the exact time and place
where Lem will be.

24:14.506 --> 24:16.093
We'll go over the exact details later.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.783
Thought you stopped other cops
from doing this kind of thing.

24:18.916 --> 24:19.912
Vic did this.

24:20.928 --> 24:22.982
I'm just trying to get you
to tell the truth.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.450
It's just somebody else's
truth, that's all.

24:26.557 --> 24:27.552
I won't get in trouble?

24:28.215 --> 24:30.632
You're gonna tell 'em
that he threatened your son.

24:30.796 --> 24:32.090
That, uh...

24:32.496 --> 24:33.742
That you were scared...

24:34.598 --> 24:36.401
and you had no other
choice but to do this.

24:36.545 --> 24:37.821
And i'll get
all those things?

24:37.987 --> 24:40.883
A house with a pool.
Monthly checks.

24:41.038 --> 24:42.642
This is real, Emolia, this is real.

24:46.225 --> 24:47.252
It might be my mom.

24:48.938 --> 24:51.350
Emolia Melendez?
You in there?

24:51.647 --> 24:53.080
It's Detective Wagenbach.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.863
I just need to ask you a few questions.

24:57.265 --> 24:58.763
You're not in trouble.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.931
Ma'am? Excuse me.

25:02.086 --> 25:03.093
Ma'am.

25:05.035 --> 25:08.363
Okay, I need a place where
Vic would wanna meet you.

25:08.578 --> 25:11.442
It needs to be a public place
where it's not very crowded.

25:11.608 --> 25:13.272
Uh, Sewing shop.

25:16.007 --> 25:17.630
Did some work for them the other day.

25:19.788 --> 25:20.793
Do you speak english?

25:22.435 --> 25:24.500
Um, excuse me...
Gracias.

25:26.595 --> 25:27.631
Hello. Wagenbach.

25:27.765 --> 25:31.410
Dutch, Jon Kavanaugh.
Did the Captain called you?

25:31.705 --> 25:32.700
No. Why?

25:32.848 --> 25:34.341
Emolia reached out to me.

25:34.886 --> 25:36.002
I'm on my way
to meet her.

25:36.158 --> 25:40.120
She's at Tama's costura,
a Sewing shop on Haden.

25:40.255 --> 25:42.242
Uh... Are you sure about that?

25:42.507 --> 25:44.620
I got some possible 20s
from calls her sister made.

25:44.748 --> 25:46.642
I think she's dodging
my knock at one of 'em.

25:46.766 --> 25:49.140
You do whatever you want,
but I would think a Sewing shop

25:49.285 --> 25:51.530
would be a great place
to follow up your Guardo lead.

25:51.666 --> 25:53.460
<i>But you know,
this is your case, whatever.</i>

25:53.928 --> 25:55.403
OK, I'll meet you there.

26:01.475 --> 26:02.642
And then what did he do?

26:03.237 --> 26:04.233
Shot out the door,

26:04.597 --> 26:07.061
called me a sick shithead,
and then tried to cap me.

26:07.678 --> 26:09.061
Got this diving out of the way.

26:10.086 --> 26:11.652
Do you have any idea who it was, Axl?

26:11.805 --> 26:12.893
Never seen him before.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.541
Think you could describe
him for a sketch artist?

26:17.685 --> 26:20.043
Yeah.
I got one of those photogenic memories.

26:23.635 --> 26:26.720
Someone is unhappy with him peddling
filth through to the neighborhood.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.451
Porn's a billion-dollar industry.

26:29.867 --> 26:32.743
What? All I'm saying is there's
a lot of people who are okay with it.

26:32.887 --> 26:35.652
Look, you start knocking
on doors across the street, alright?

26:35.886 --> 26:36.880
I'll get these.

26:38.506 --> 26:41.253
You could use
some tight-assed lube yourself, sparky.

26:42.485 --> 26:43.553
What am I supposed to do?

26:43.707 --> 26:46.733
Just sit back and let this
shitbag tank my career, too?

26:47.428 --> 26:48.531
He's goddamn poison.

26:48.658 --> 26:50.041
Kavanaugh's not my problem.

26:50.538 --> 26:51.552
Oh, I am?

26:51.686 --> 26:53.791
Pensions hasn't received
your retirement paperwork.

26:54.217 --> 26:56.603
- I'm still sorting that out.
- You were supposed to keep

26:56.757 --> 26:59.433
a low profile so you could get out with
a piece of your pension.

26:59.565 --> 27:01.200
There's been a lot going on around here.

27:02.718 --> 27:04.452
Phillips thinks too much is going on.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.961
This came directly
from the chief's office.

27:13.356 --> 27:15.400
This puts my retirement
effective immediately.

27:15.588 --> 27:18.793
You take it now, the chief will
see you get a piece of your pension.

27:19.667 --> 27:20.680
Why now?

27:20.905 --> 27:22.513
I had until my 15 mark.

27:23.847 --> 27:25.470
Certain things are in motion.

27:25.988 --> 27:27.222
This is a lifeline.

27:27.357 --> 27:29.770
Sign this, and it'll
save us all a lot of grief.

27:29.917 --> 27:31.731
- If you don't...
- You can't cut me loose.

27:31.886 --> 27:32.890
It's not my idea.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.111
Brass is gonna be watching
every move you make.

27:35.315 --> 27:36.990
You need me to make this place work.

27:37.138 --> 27:38.911
I need people I can trust.

27:41.178 --> 27:42.543
So you won't help me fight this.

27:42.675 --> 27:43.773
You know a reason I should?

27:45.508 --> 27:47.030
Quentin showed up at another clinic.

27:47.186 --> 27:48.940
Unis spooked him. He's got hostages.

27:51.126 --> 27:52.503
Who you're gonna trust with that?

27:56.955 --> 27:58.201
All right, boys, here it is.

27:58.597 --> 28:00.981
This guy's got a doctor,
a mother and her 3-month-old son

28:01.118 --> 28:02.282
trapped in an examing room.

28:02.995 --> 28:05.060
He's doused the Doc
and the mother with gasoline,

28:05.186 --> 28:07.642
threatened to use them as kindling
if they didn't shut down

28:07.795 --> 28:10.710
- all their methadone clinics.
- Negotiator and SWAT's 30 minutes out.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.962
Let's go.
Shane, you coming?

28:13.628 --> 28:15.013
- Shane.
- Yeah.

28:15.858 --> 28:16.850
Yeah.

28:21.317 --> 28:23.510
He'll shoot the cans,
blow the hallway if he

28:23.645 --> 28:24.791
needs to seal himself off.

28:25.306 --> 28:27.323
Hey, there skylights in every room
in this place?

28:28.467 --> 28:29.463
Get her out of here.

28:30.915 --> 28:32.212
Get me a peeper scope.

28:32.366 --> 28:35.262
I'll go on the roof, see if
I can look in on what's happening there.

28:35.615 --> 28:37.521
I don't want anyone
rattling this guy's cage.

28:37.665 --> 28:39.341
I don't want anyone talking to him.
Hey.

28:40.556 --> 28:41.770
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

28:42.745 --> 28:44.511
'cause Ronnie and I
can take care of this.

28:44.646 --> 28:46.041
- I'm here man.
- No, you're not.

28:46.176 --> 28:47.850
I got innocents soaked with gasoline.

28:48.176 --> 28:49.963
- I need your head in the game.
- It is.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.480
I promise. I'm OK.

28:52.608 --> 28:53.602
Okay.

29:01.098 --> 29:02.090
Can I help you?

29:02.547 --> 29:04.030
You have any idea where Vic is?

29:04.288 --> 29:05.990
We haven't seen him
since Lem's memorial.

29:06.735 --> 29:07.741
No, I don't. I saw him

29:07.876 --> 29:09.660
at the barn for a second.
That's about it.

29:12.146 --> 29:13.323
You think Vic's staying here?

29:14.225 --> 29:15.291
It crossed my mind.

29:15.466 --> 29:16.463
He's not.

29:18.016 --> 29:19.013
Sorry.

29:21.196 --> 29:23.973
Hey. Vic and me, we're not a thing.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.661
What about that thing in your arms?

29:27.806 --> 29:30.092
Whatever shitpile you're
cleaning up with your ex,

29:30.225 --> 29:32.030
don't come dumping it
on my doorstep.

29:33.527 --> 29:35.041
And don't ever call my son a thing,

29:35.548 --> 29:36.702
you uptight bitch.

29:36.857 --> 29:38.691
I'm not uptight, sweetheart.

29:38.845 --> 29:39.903
I'm a realist.

29:40.185 --> 29:41.742
You have no idea what has been dumped

29:41.878 --> 29:42.933
on your doorstep.

29:43.497 --> 29:45.650
Vic. He is not gonna be there for him.

29:45.787 --> 29:47.662
- Well, I don't need anyone's help.
- Really?

29:47.797 --> 29:50.572
You think you're gonna be a full-time
cop and take care of this kid

29:50.697 --> 29:52.991
- all by yourself?
- Just 'cause you couldn't handle it

29:53.128 --> 29:56.320
- doesn't mean that I won't be able to.
- And if they tell you he's autistic?

30:01.398 --> 30:02.742
My son is fine.

30:02.908 --> 30:04.213
They're all fine at first.

30:05.156 --> 30:06.582
But we have 2 autistic kids,

30:06.715 --> 30:09.431
and there's a genetic
predisposition for siblings.

30:10.195 --> 30:12.180
Maybe you're the one
with the screwed-up genes.

30:12.338 --> 30:14.730
Maybe. Maybe not.
But keep your eyes open

30:14.886 --> 30:17.951
because the sooner the doctors know,
the more they can do for him, okay?

30:24.258 --> 30:26.151
Mom and the doctor
are jammed in the corner.

30:26.276 --> 30:28.922
The baby's on a table by the door.

30:29.066 --> 30:30.623
If we can get him to give up the kid,

30:30.766 --> 30:33.103
<i>SWAT can drop down between
the junkie and the innocents.</i>

30:33.235 --> 30:35.540
I'll get an E.T.A.
On SWAT and the negotiator.

30:36.948 --> 30:38.870
Jesus Christ.
Don't hurt that little baby.

30:39.006 --> 30:42.190
Stop! I'm gonna kill
this goddamn baby, man.

30:45.038 --> 30:46.841
Everybody just shut the hell up!

30:46.997 --> 30:48.453
I'm gonna kill this goddamn thing.

30:48.608 --> 30:49.610
Hey, Quentin.

30:49.825 --> 30:50.820
Shane.

30:51.895 --> 30:52.903
Quentin.

30:53.038 --> 30:54.032
Listen to me, man.

30:54.387 --> 30:57.290
The reason the baby's crying
is 'cause of the gasoline.

30:57.706 --> 30:59.690
The fumes are probably burning his eyes.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.203
What the hell's he doing?

31:03.356 --> 31:04.372
You better get down here.

31:04.497 --> 31:07.572
Just hand the kid over to me,
get a little peace and quiet.

31:07.806 --> 31:09.222
Just focus on what you got to do.

31:13.048 --> 31:14.192
Who the hell are you, man?

31:14.727 --> 31:16.003
I'm a cop. What?

31:16.305 --> 31:18.291
I'm a cop. Shane Vendrell.
I'm unarmed.

31:19.026 --> 31:21.042
Just hand over the crying kid...

31:22.146 --> 31:23.162
and take me instead.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.311
A quiet Detective is a much
better bargaining chip, man.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.341
Nah. It's a con.

31:31.497 --> 31:33.480
You're full of shit.
Just like everything else.

31:33.636 --> 31:35.340
No, it's not a con. It's...

31:36.776 --> 31:37.780
Oh, no!

31:38.586 --> 31:39.601
Quentin.

31:40.236 --> 31:42.122
Quentin, listen to me.
Open the door, buddy.

31:42.756 --> 31:44.120
Quentin, open the door.

31:44.487 --> 31:47.051
Look, OK. Look.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.762
Look, buddy. You see?

31:50.627 --> 31:51.631
You see?

31:52.125 --> 31:53.121
Oh, my God.

31:55.436 --> 31:56.602
Jesus Christ, Shane.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.450
It's no con, man.

32:01.107 --> 32:02.113
It's no con.

32:02.477 --> 32:03.731
Get ready to move.

32:06.746 --> 32:08.363
Any point you think I'm lying...

32:08.797 --> 32:10.051
Just...

32:10.277 --> 32:11.631
You just flick your bic, brother.

32:12.415 --> 32:13.412
Okay?

32:14.375 --> 32:15.672
Don't worry. I will, man.

32:16.857 --> 32:17.860
Shit!

32:19.398 --> 32:20.392
Quentin!

32:21.118 --> 32:22.320
Quentin, listen to me, man.

32:22.478 --> 32:24.691
Is there a closet in there
or a cabinet or something?

32:24.827 --> 32:26.431
Somewhere where the baby can breathe.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.281
Yeah. I mean, it's...

32:29.406 --> 32:31.902
good. Just put him in there
and close the door, OK?

32:32.287 --> 32:33.801
It keeps the fumes out of his eyes.

32:45.447 --> 32:46.510
See? I told you, Quentin.

32:48.125 --> 32:49.673
I told you, man, you can trust me.

32:53.278 --> 32:54.911
I think this psycho's going for Shane.

33:01.097 --> 33:02.093
Stop. Right there.

33:05.348 --> 33:06.353
You get him?

33:07.328 --> 33:08.323
Are you all right?

33:09.016 --> 33:10.902
Yeah. Glad you put on a vest.

33:11.045 --> 33:12.040
Check the kid.

33:17.375 --> 33:20.020
You wanna tell me what
the hell happened back here?

33:23.346 --> 33:25.982
We just saved 3 innocents
from a homicidal junkie.

33:27.408 --> 33:28.981
Maybe you could draw up the paperwork

33:29.617 --> 33:30.663
and let me sign it.

33:37.188 --> 33:39.332
You lied. You lied to me.

33:39.966 --> 33:40.960
You lied!

33:45.087 --> 33:47.221
Captain, here's a sketch
of that guy that shot up

33:47.358 --> 33:48.543
the sex shop this morning.

33:48.697 --> 33:50.380
Black, early 20s, earrings.

33:50.525 --> 33:51.641
Narrows things down.

33:53.127 --> 33:54.933
I don't have anybody free.

33:55.085 --> 33:57.030
Could you jump on
this porn shop shooting?

33:57.176 --> 33:59.812
Sounds titillating,
but I'm still a little woozy.

34:00.156 --> 34:02.411
That's what I get for trying
to keep the peace, right?

34:02.548 --> 34:03.593
Maybe you should go home.

34:03.947 --> 34:06.393
I leave now it chews up
one of my personal days.

34:06.885 --> 34:09.273
I'm gonna hang
and clean up some paperwork.

34:09.536 --> 34:10.553
I'll be OK.

34:10.688 --> 34:11.692
Thank God.

34:12.437 --> 34:15.751
Circulate it to the skin joints,
bookstores. See if he's a regular.

34:16.116 --> 34:17.172
OK.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.083
DMV didn't have any of the addresses

34:20.217 --> 34:22.603
on the cousins of the el Salvadoran
we questioned.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.161
And I'm still waiting on I.N.S.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.322
Good girl.

34:30.156 --> 34:31.161
Good girl?

34:31.288 --> 34:33.522
It's part of my new
mentoring philosophy.

34:33.688 --> 34:34.681
Right.

34:35.926 --> 34:38.603
I thought you were meeting
Kavanaugh and picking up Emolia.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.003
Me, too. Sent me to the sewing shop.
It was closed.

34:41.126 --> 34:42.130
No one ever showed.

34:45.888 --> 34:47.213
Vic said I should tell Guardo

34:47.364 --> 34:48.750
I was sorry for turning on him.

34:49.525 --> 34:52.021
Offer up my handler asrestitucion.

34:52.735 --> 34:54.572
He knew that guardo
would wanna hurt the cop

34:54.717 --> 34:56.482
that crushed his drug
protection comeback.

34:56.625 --> 34:59.312
Jesus. You told 'em it was Lem.

35:00.055 --> 35:02.470
They gave me the place, the time.

35:02.665 --> 35:06.152
I set it up. Told him it was a
blond cop I've been working for.

35:06.545 --> 35:08.800
You did this because
Vic threatened your son.

35:09.395 --> 35:11.723
Said if I did it,
he'd give me 500 bucks.

35:11.858 --> 35:12.861
If I didn't,

35:12.987 --> 35:15.361
Sebastio's hospital bill
would be a hundred times

35:15.486 --> 35:16.493
that much.

35:16.626 --> 35:17.653
What choice did I have?

35:18.146 --> 35:19.152
You have the money?

35:19.796 --> 35:22.711
No. He was supposed to drop it
off at the Sewing shop yesterday.

35:22.876 --> 35:25.081
He never did.
I got scared.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.973
Figured if he could off
his own guy that way,

35:28.365 --> 35:30.310
what's to stop him
from killing me and my boy?

35:30.657 --> 35:31.742
That's why she called me.

35:32.637 --> 35:35.532
I got a man staying with her
mother and with her son right now.

35:36.478 --> 35:39.293
Yeah. I just want us all to be safe.

35:39.987 --> 35:41.130
Far away from Vic.

35:42.256 --> 35:43.381
Phillips is on his way.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.890
We should wait till he gets here before
we get into more of these details.

35:47.505 --> 35:48.512
You did fine.

35:55.445 --> 35:56.901
Hey, uh, what happened to you?

35:57.045 --> 35:58.172
I went to the Sewing shop.

35:58.727 --> 35:59.720
Oh, sorry about that.

36:00.458 --> 36:04.532
Emolia moved the meeting place
3 times after I talked to you.

36:04.666 --> 36:05.951
Where'd you finally meet her?

36:06.647 --> 36:09.121
Behind Sid's.
Coffee place on Wilton.

36:09.627 --> 36:12.073
That place across from the 101 on Ramp?

36:13.035 --> 36:14.063
I think so. I think so.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.163
Ask Emolia. She'd know.

36:16.486 --> 36:17.680
Anyway, no harm, no foul.

36:25.007 --> 36:27.353
Easy. Ow!
I know you're pissed at me.

36:27.487 --> 36:30.481
I don't give a shit
if I hear from you, OK?

36:31.038 --> 36:32.183
I'll make it up to the kids.

36:32.337 --> 36:35.152
Hope you have another bag of cash
put aside for the years of therapy,

36:35.288 --> 36:36.881
- they're gonna need
- Don't say that.

36:37.027 --> 36:38.112
Cass is just like you.

36:38.276 --> 36:40.122
- She internalizes everything.
- Hey!

36:40.546 --> 36:41.552
Hey. You doing OK?

36:41.835 --> 36:43.741
Yeah. I'll live,

36:43.897 --> 36:45.990
as long as my ex isn't
the one taking care of me.

36:46.246 --> 36:47.492
Hey, Corrine.
Hey.

36:48.596 --> 36:50.413
We're gonna need an x-ray
of that shoulder.

36:54.905 --> 36:56.041
How you feeling?

36:56.367 --> 36:57.360
Good.

36:57.505 --> 36:59.213
I still smell a little like diesel.

36:59.697 --> 37:01.240
Just like Ronnie's aftershave.

37:06.736 --> 37:08.030
What the hell was that today?

37:10.046 --> 37:11.801
I just saw a way
to make your plan work.

37:12.227 --> 37:14.522
My plan wasn't turning you
into a duraflame.

37:15.475 --> 37:17.180
I've had enough funerals for one week.

37:18.697 --> 37:20.031
It was just my own little spin.

37:20.926 --> 37:23.291
You can put another one
in the win column, though, right?

37:26.286 --> 37:27.293
Listen, man.

37:28.307 --> 37:30.311
We've all been beating
ourselves up about Lem.

37:32.047 --> 37:33.693
But it's like you said, man.

37:34.898 --> 37:36.123
It's nobody's fault.

37:37.228 --> 37:38.290
Except Guardo's.

37:38.425 --> 37:39.802
- Yeah.
- Hey.

37:40.907 --> 37:41.913
Come here.

37:45.736 --> 37:48.301
Wyms and the chief are trying
to push through my retirement.

37:48.765 --> 37:51.082
I'm not sure why,
but I don't have much time.

37:51.236 --> 37:52.481
- No man.
- That's why you...

37:52.616 --> 37:54.492
can't get reckless.
You hear me?

37:56.497 --> 37:58.501
I'm gonna need your help
to finish this thing.

38:00.596 --> 38:02.040
I can't lose you, too, Shane.

38:05.026 --> 38:06.023
You won't.

38:15.237 --> 38:16.393
This doesn't add up.

38:16.616 --> 38:18.982
The pieces fit. Motive, timing.

38:19.647 --> 38:21.020
He's got a compelling case.

38:21.406 --> 38:25.983
Look, you and I both know Vic is a
cop with questionable ethics.

38:26.368 --> 38:29.270
He capable of killing another cop?
Maybe. But Lem?

38:30.548 --> 38:31.723
Her story's a little neat.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.691
I'm at the last house
on the D.E.A. List.

38:33.825 --> 38:35.682
I knock. I definitely
hear someone inside.

38:35.858 --> 38:38.020
Maybe two people.
They don't come to the door.

38:38.158 --> 38:39.812
Then I get a call from Kavanaugh

38:39.967 --> 38:42.103
sending me off and running
to the sewing shop?

38:43.066 --> 38:44.223
Seems strange.

38:45.165 --> 38:47.480
You think he's pushing the story?

38:48.407 --> 38:49.400
Lying?

38:49.787 --> 38:51.183
That doesn't fit either.

38:51.335 --> 38:53.680
Here's a guy who wouldn't bend
the rules for his ex-wife

38:53.837 --> 38:55.810
when any other cop
in this building would have.

38:57.978 --> 38:58.981
I know that look.

39:00.628 --> 39:01.680
Something's not right.

39:02.865 --> 39:04.850
Chief wants Vic
on the retired list

39:05.167 --> 39:06.742
before we file any charges.

39:07.328 --> 39:08.752
He's not going without a fight.

39:09.157 --> 39:10.260
What do you want me to do?

39:12.065 --> 39:13.231
Stick to the Guardo angle.

39:13.367 --> 39:14.632
Bring Vic in for questioning.

39:14.817 --> 39:16.830
See what he has to say
about Emolia's story.

39:17.198 --> 39:18.200
Okay.

39:21.746 --> 39:22.813
I'm gonna head home now.

39:23.617 --> 39:25.653
I might need to take
that personal day tomorrow.

39:25.808 --> 39:28.561
Oh, we'll try to fill the void.

39:30.637 --> 39:31.642
Uh, Vic.

39:32.668 --> 39:33.922
You cruising for interns?

39:34.075 --> 39:35.083
How's the shoulder?

39:35.227 --> 39:36.283
Kevlar is my friend.

39:39.375 --> 39:40.950
Kavanaugh's brought in a witness

39:41.076 --> 39:43.360
who claims you hired
the el Salvadorans to kill Lem.

39:44.968 --> 39:45.970
What witness?

39:46.536 --> 39:47.811
Emolia Melendez.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.312
What's Kavanaugh offering her?

39:52.686 --> 39:53.722
Witness protection.

39:55.615 --> 39:56.862
So you're here to arrest me?

39:57.087 --> 39:58.521
Right now I just need a statement.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.210
You think I did it? Lem?

40:02.768 --> 40:04.360
I need to take you back to the barn.

40:05.567 --> 40:06.782
Well, I can drive myself.

40:12.498 --> 40:14.093
OK. I'll see you back there.

40:26.648 --> 40:29.192
Mackey's lawyer will
paint her as a paid snitch,

40:29.326 --> 40:30.971
promised the american dream in exchange

40:31.107 --> 40:32.160
for her testimony.

40:32.297 --> 40:34.033
There's no evidence backing this story.

40:34.536 --> 40:36.522
That's why I wanna
continue this investigation.

40:36.666 --> 40:38.053
This report is not complete yet.

40:38.255 --> 40:40.540
What about Wagenbach's
el Salvadoran suspect?

40:41.465 --> 40:43.111
I've seen Dutch cozy up to Mackey.

40:43.258 --> 40:45.063
I don't know where his loyalty lands.

40:45.195 --> 40:46.973
We need to get him off
this Lemansky case.

40:47.127 --> 40:49.320
We don't want another guy
tipped off and on the run.

40:53.187 --> 40:54.183
Okay.

40:57.027 --> 40:58.183
I'll talk to Wyms about him.

40:58.378 --> 41:00.903
But this time if you can't
keep it from becoming personal,

41:02.128 --> 41:03.781
I'll go disciplinary on you, Jon.

41:04.088 --> 41:06.661
You'll lose those lt bars.
You hear that?

41:07.138 --> 41:08.133
I hear it.

41:08.297 --> 41:10.580
Tell the chief he's got my word.
Nothing personal.

41:17.605 --> 41:18.612
What's this?

41:18.757 --> 41:21.423
Requesting today's footage
from the 101 freeway cam

41:21.555 --> 41:25.043
at the Wilton on-ramp
across from Sid's coffee.

41:25.528 --> 41:26.523
Just a hunch.

41:27.137 --> 41:29.172
Any sign of Vic? Not yet.

41:29.778 --> 41:32.473
Captain, a guy fitting the description
of our sex shop shooter

41:32.615 --> 41:34.253
was seen in 4 other video stores today.

41:34.378 --> 41:35.861
He bought out every copy of that.

41:38.247 --> 41:41.402
I am not familiar with
the "Dick 'n' Granny" series.

41:41.548 --> 41:43.562
Hopo productions is owned and operated

41:43.705 --> 41:44.811
by holes and poles, inc.

41:44.955 --> 41:46.370
That the owner who got shot at?

41:46.506 --> 41:49.791
Yes. Not only is Axl the producer,
director, and distributor.

41:50.278 --> 41:52.233
But guess who's wearing
the Nixon mask.

41:52.997 --> 41:54.880
The Richard Nixon mask's
a reflection of your

41:55.038 --> 41:56.031
political bent?

41:56.166 --> 41:58.140
Or are you just afraid to be associated

41:58.278 --> 41:59.271
with your own smut?

41:59.775 --> 42:00.773
It's my hook.

42:01.796 --> 42:03.630
I'm Richard Nixon
and I'm dickin' granny.

42:03.775 --> 42:06.140
Yeah, we get it.
Who's the old lady?

42:06.278 --> 42:07.603
Why?
She's of age, right?

42:10.338 --> 42:12.640
- All my actors sign contracts...
- Whoever shot at you

42:12.808 --> 42:15.032
this morning bought up
every copy of that in the city.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.693
Maybe he's a little upset
about you dickin' granny.

42:19.925 --> 42:22.552
Shit. Number 3.

42:23.247 --> 42:24.302
Forgot her name.

42:24.458 --> 42:27.063
First-timer.
She was raw.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.602
But in the end, I always
get a good performance.

42:31.145 --> 42:32.900
We need a name and address.

42:34.046 --> 42:35.042
It's Vic.

42:36.315 --> 42:37.320
Yeah.

42:37.455 --> 42:40.483
Anyone ever tell you that you
have incredibly expressive eyes?

42:41.077 --> 42:42.190
Ever been on film?

42:43.326 --> 42:44.593
Ever been in a mug book?

42:48.158 --> 42:50.781
Family emergency.
He can't come in right now.

42:51.085 --> 42:52.311
He'll run out of emergencies,

42:52.446 --> 42:53.732
then we'll get to the truth.

42:55.416 --> 42:57.660
Hard to believe this place
was ever a church.

42:59.345 --> 43:01.710
We can track down
Axl's granny in the morning.

43:02.075 --> 43:03.101
It's been a long day.

43:03.256 --> 43:06.030
I'm okay. I'll wait for the
address and follow it up tonight.

43:06.418 --> 43:09.520
It's your first week.
You can't keep up this kind of pace.

43:10.226 --> 43:12.402
Now, I'm just talking general health.

43:13.005 --> 43:14.771
You got to take care of yourself.

43:16.947 --> 43:19.441
Can I tell you something
doesn't go beyond these pews?

43:19.786 --> 43:20.793
Of course.

43:21.588 --> 43:23.362
Phillips paid me a visit today.

43:26.685 --> 43:28.343
If I don't turn this place around

43:29.687 --> 43:31.651
before the quarterly
statistics come out,

43:33.017 --> 43:35.630
they might be saying mass
down there again real soon.

43:46.838 --> 43:47.873
I'm Captain Wyms.

43:48.005 --> 43:49.613
Sorry to disturb you so late, ma'am.

43:50.608 --> 43:51.611
You know this man?

43:56.268 --> 43:57.270
Edmond!

43:58.388 --> 43:59.460
Edmond!

44:00.318 --> 44:01.971
Stop!
Stop!

44:02.178 --> 44:03.270
Drop the gun!

44:03.737 --> 44:04.741
Drop that gun.

44:05.207 --> 44:06.202
Drop the gun.

44:06.338 --> 44:08.371
Please, kid, just drop the gun.

44:08.718 --> 44:11.103
- Please don't make me shoot you.
- Drop the gun, asshole

44:11.235 --> 44:13.061
- or I will shoot.
- Edmond, don't!

44:13.627 --> 44:15.822
- Just drop the gun, kid.
- Drop the gun goddamn it!

44:15.958 --> 44:17.581
- Do it now!
- Drop... The gun.

44:19.006 --> 44:20.000
Get on your knees.

44:20.337 --> 44:21.472
Why did you do it, grandma?

44:21.607 --> 44:23.613
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your knees.

44:23.755 --> 44:24.750
Right now!

44:27.368 --> 44:29.173
How could you let that man
do that to you?

44:30.507 --> 44:33.580
He got arrested for stealing
a car 6 months ago.

44:34.888 --> 44:36.411
I need his bail money.

44:37.798 --> 44:39.342
You shouldn't have
done it, grandma.

44:39.577 --> 44:40.823
Why'd you be his whore?

44:47.017 --> 44:48.021
What are you doing here?

44:50.927 --> 44:52.452
You got Emolia to lie for you.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.540
Now you know the difference
between a lie and a truth?

44:56.988 --> 44:58.491
You think I'm a cop killer.

45:00.938 --> 45:02.051
Maybe I am.

45:05.098 --> 45:07.203
You're a cop, right?

45:10.898 --> 45:13.383
That sounds like a direct
threat on my life, Detective.

45:13.935 --> 45:14.963
You know what that means?

45:16.568 --> 45:17.602
It means you just stepped

45:17.737 --> 45:19.963
onto an entirely
new playing field.

45:21.908 --> 45:22.921
And for your sake,

45:24.277 --> 45:25.963
I hope you know the rules of the game.

45:29.895 --> 45:31.883
That it? You came all the way down here

45:32.025 --> 45:33.250
just to blow words by me?

45:33.557 --> 45:34.633
It's a street tactic.

45:35.287 --> 45:37.843
Always let the bad guy
know you're on to his game.

45:38.678 --> 45:41.850
Makes him change tact
so he makes mistakes.

45:42.066 --> 45:43.491
Then I guess I should let you know

45:44.268 --> 45:46.273
that you're wanted for
questioning in the murder

45:46.398 --> 45:47.403
of Curtis Lemansky.

45:48.307 --> 45:49.540
There are unis at your house,

45:49.747 --> 45:51.340
and they're waiting to bring you in.

45:58.945 --> 46:00.062
Gabino Guiz.

46:00.338 --> 46:02.811
This is the address
I.N.S. gave me for the cousin.

46:02.985 --> 46:06.040
Nobody home.
What a shock. Let's go.

46:26.138 --> 46:27.691
Oh, that's gross.

46:29.386 --> 46:31.892
Dutch. Bloody cat prints.

46:43.937 --> 46:45.383
Crime scene. Tread lightly.

46:48.947 --> 46:53.653
6-Paul-32 requesting
4 additional units and CSU

46:53.815 --> 46:55.590
at 89 San Marcos.

46:55.736 --> 46:58.650
I've got multiple 187s,

46:58.935 --> 47:01.481
3, possibly 4...

47:12.518 --> 47:14.310
you got to be shitting me.

47:15.255 --> 47:16.690
They're asleep.

47:16.897 --> 47:18.703
I just didn't feel like going home.

47:20.717 --> 47:22.641
I'm sorry I dropped out this week.

47:23.996 --> 47:25.683
They just need to hear your voice.

47:27.986 --> 47:28.980
What is it?

47:29.155 --> 47:31.983
Kavanaugh's trying to prove I had
something to do with Lem's death.

47:32.145 --> 47:34.611
Oh, my God. That's ridiculous.

47:34.768 --> 47:37.492
He got some low-life
C.I. To lie for him.

47:38.106 --> 47:39.293
What are you gonna do?

47:41.566 --> 47:42.560
<i>I'll get right to it.</i>

47:44.087 --> 47:46.563
<i>Last year Captain Rawling
initiated an inquiry</i>

47:46.716 --> 47:49.053
<i>into the Farmington gang and drug unit.</i>

47:50.127 --> 47:52.743
Supervised by lieutenant
Kavanaugh from I.A.D.,

47:52.887 --> 47:55.583
<i>this department conducted
a 7 month investigation...</i>

47:56.147 --> 47:57.151
Daddy!

47:57.286 --> 47:59.182
Get out! Go back in your room right now!

47:59.687 --> 48:00.881
I'm sorry. I just didn't want

48:01.015 --> 48:03.490
- her to see.
- <i>Detective Lemansky fled justice,</i>

48:03.648 --> 48:04.712
<i>became a wanted fugitive.</i>

48:05.605 --> 48:07.652
<i>No doubt the thought
of spending years in prison</i>

48:07.805 --> 48:09.433
<i>was a frightening proposition.</i>

48:10.498 --> 48:11.493
<i>We'll never know</i>

48:12.338 --> 48:14.882
<i>what triggered Detective
Lemansky's reluctance</i>

48:15.826 --> 48:16.842
<i>to serve his time.</i>

48:16.967 --> 48:18.441
<i>Because less than 24 hours later,</i>

48:18.885 --> 48:20.273
<i>he was found brutally murdered.</i>

48:22.367 --> 48:24.512
<i>Someone dropped a live grenade</i>

48:24.655 --> 48:25.943
<i>in the front seat of his car.</i>

48:28.325 --> 48:30.440
<i>That murder investigation
is ongoing and as of yet</i>

48:31.438 --> 48:32.851
<i>no suspects are in custody.</i>

48:36.976 --> 48:39.061
<i>And our condolences go out
to Detective Lemansky's</i>

48:39.218 --> 48:40.273
<i>friends and family.</i>

48:42.488 --> 48:44.372
<i>But within this tragedy,
there is a message,</i>

48:45.727 --> 48:48.680
<i>and one that I hope will
shake this department to its core.</i>

48:51.926 --> 48:55.461
<i>Breaking the law and wearing a
badge is a dangerous combination,</i>

48:57.347 --> 48:58.811
<i>and this city will not tolerate it.</i>

48:59.698 --> 49:01.693
<i>This department
will not tolerate it.</i>

49:07.637 --> 49:09.691
<i>It's the primary objective
of this Police Council</i>

49:09.826 --> 49:11.641
<i>over the next 18 months</i>

49:13.205 --> 49:15.362
<i>to squash corruption
within our own ranks.</i>

49:20.928 --> 49:22.922
<i>And cops involved
in any illegal activities</i>

49:24.318 --> 49:25.342
<i>will be rooted out.</i>

49:26.198 --> 49:27.540
<i>They will be relieved of duty</i>

49:28.896 --> 49:31.133
<i>and prosecuted to
the full extent of the law,</i>

49:32.837 --> 49:35.690
<i>just as Detective Curtis
Lemansky was being prosecuted</i>

49:35.848 --> 49:37.242
<i>for his corrupt actions.</i>

49:37.498 --> 49:38.540
You son of a bitch.

49:38.695 --> 49:40.200
<i>This community
needs police officers <i></i></i>

49:40.358 --> 49:42.470
<i>who are peaceful and
trustworthy civil servants.</i>

49:44.058 --> 49:45.142
<i>It's our goal</i>

49:45.786 --> 49:48.702
<i>to return dignity
and respect</i>

49:49.127 --> 49:50.152
<i>to the badge...</i>

49:56.048 --> 49:58.513
And to the men and women who
wear one a reason to be proud.

50:06.018 --> 50:07.312
Nothing personal.
