That is quite
the skill, Ms. Hicks.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.922
I'm sorry,
Professor Walton.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.880
No, no. I get it.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.882
Midterms week
is stressful.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.841
So, I understand
why your paper

00:58.884 --> 01:00.277
didn't quite
hit the mark.

01:00.321 --> 01:03.193
With all due respect,
Professor Walton,

01:03.237 --> 01:04.934
I think that my paper
on food insecurity

01:04.977 --> 01:07.545
as a public health crisis
was pretty on point.

01:07.589 --> 01:10.287
Full of facts
and figures

01:10.331 --> 01:14.074
but no personal connection
to the topic.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.423
But this is a real issue
in this country

01:15.466 --> 01:17.033
that I empathize with.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.340
In order
to improve public health,

01:19.383 --> 01:22.517
you have to first understand
how it affects you personally.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.127
So, are you gonna
fail me?

01:24.170 --> 01:26.477
No. I'm going
to invite you

01:26.521 --> 01:28.914
to dig deeper
and submit a new paper.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.133
Wait. Are you serious?

01:30.176 --> 01:31.569
As serious as
the 8 a.m. deadline

must be posted.

Ahh. Yo, D., have you
heard a word I said?

01:49.152 --> 01:52.416
What? My bad, bro.
Uh, what's up?

01:52.460 --> 01:54.418

zoned out?

01:57.073 --> 02:00.990

02:01.033 --> 02:02.513
kinda had a moment.

Y'all have
a lot of moments.

not talking to me.

to interrupt, fellas,

for a minute.

02:13.176 --> 02:16.440
No. You're good.
What's up, Coach?

02:16.484 --> 02:18.399
The faculty grades
the team exams early

02:18.442 --> 02:21.053
so I can get ahead of
any academic issues.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.403
But, Damon, I'm
afraid to say that

02:22.446 --> 02:24.405
you failed
your stats midterm.

[Scoffs]

02:28.017 --> 02:30.062
Nah, Coach.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.281
but, like,
me failing it?

02:31.325 --> 02:33.196
This lowers
your GPA to 2.5.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.067
Oh, we good.
NCAA requirement is 2.0.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.941
Yeah, but ours isn't.
Remember?

02:38.984 --> 02:41.422
Post-cheating scandal,
you raised ours to 2.75.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.293
I needed this to be
clear to everyone

02:43.337 --> 02:45.774
that my boys are for
real student-athletes.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.645
Come on, Coach. Damon's
still grieving his father.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.821
Look, without our ace pitcher,
our rankings could drop.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.346
Couldn't you just make
an exception for us
just this one time?

They can't do that, J.
Our education comes first.

02:55.043 --> 02:57.177

eligibility at stake.

Excuse me,
but you'll need
to vacate the area.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.894
I reserved
the common room
for a campaign event.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.548
That can't be right
because I reserved it.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.202
Are you calling me a liar?

09:54.245 --> 09:55.812
No. You don't lie
to get what you want.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.118
You're more of a "speak
to the manager" type.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.076

any good,

in back-to-back midterms.

and she confirmed

10:03.559 --> 10:06.083

the room. See?

10:06.127 --> 10:08.433
I wrote my name
on the clipboard,

10:08.477 --> 10:09.870
so, I'm not
cancelling my event.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.742

because neither am I.

OK, well, why don't
you guys

events on different
sides of the room?

10:21.316 --> 10:23.100

chose to compromise?

voters, right?

the ones that are

the two athletes.

the deets on that one.

It's about you and Lando.

No! It's about
you and Damon?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.473
I don't know. Maybe.
I'm not 100% sure.

computer science friend

magic and figure out
who posted it?

10:57.569 --> 10:59.049
And if they find them,
then what?

10:59.093 --> 11:00.660
Then I will
kindly ask them

business in the streets.

doesn't work?

none of that.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.017

what about Thea?

11:11.105 --> 11:12.846
None of this was planned,

11:12.889 --> 11:15.762

Thea broke up with Damon.

You have a minute?

11:43.311 --> 11:45.008
Of course.
What's on your mind?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.358
I failed my stats midterm,

11:47.402 --> 11:49.186
and I know the material,
and I think that

11:49.230 --> 11:52.059
I figured out, like,
why I failed.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.974
I just want some advice.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.932
I'm all ears.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.717
So, in class, I'm good,

11:57.760 --> 12:00.676
because we use
hands-on demonstrations.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.199
But since the test
was paper...

12:02.243 --> 12:04.245
The issue is
how the information

12:04.288 --> 12:05.899
on the midterm
was presented.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.728
Exactly. Like,
I did some research,

12:08.771 --> 12:10.512
and there are
different types of learners,

12:10.555 --> 12:12.296
and I think that I'm
a kinesthetic learner.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.950
Amara: Hmm.
Damon: At least with numbers.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.605
I do better with
hands-on stuff. Always have.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.215
Well, if that's
the case,

12:18.259 --> 12:19.869
you were at
a disadvantage.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.219
I think your professor
would be receptive,

12:22.263 --> 12:24.700
but only if you go in
with a solution.

Why does that surprise you?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.478

isn't bearing fruit,

14:01.275 --> 14:03.451
come in different shapes,
colors, walks of life,

14:03.494 --> 14:05.322
and I think the worst thing
that we can do

14:05.366 --> 14:06.976
is judge others
because their walk

14:07.020 --> 14:08.673

14:19.380 --> 14:22.165
The reason Lions' Den
no longer exists

Too quiet.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.775
I heard every single
one of my thoughts.

18:44.819 --> 18:47.256
I thought coming
back to school,

18:47.300 --> 18:48.736
you know, would be
good for me,

18:48.779 --> 18:50.303
but I'm just
messing it all up.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.043
And everyone
is telling me

18:52.087 --> 18:53.697
it's because
I'm grieving,

18:53.741 --> 18:56.744
but I don't want grief
to control my life.

18:56.787 --> 19:00.791
I lost my father
when I was in college, too.

19:00.835 --> 19:05.622
Grief is your brain
trying to reconcile
two worlds--

19:05.666 --> 19:07.450
the one with
your father in it

19:07.494 --> 19:09.365
and the one
without him.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.411
But you're
still you, Damon.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.152
You will find a way
to move forward.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.501
How?

19:14.544 --> 19:16.242
By talking to the people
who love you,

19:16.285 --> 19:18.766
by being honest
about your feelings.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.071
Hey, come on, Dr. P.

19:20.115 --> 19:23.074
If I'm honest and I
get closer to people,

19:23.118 --> 19:26.121
it's just gonna hurt
more if I lose them, too.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.428
That's the great
riddle of life.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.299
We don't know
what the future holds,

19:30.343 --> 19:32.301
but that's exactly
the reason

19:32.345 --> 19:35.696
to tell your family,
both blood and chosen,

19:35.739 --> 19:37.524
how much you care.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.839
Woman: Hey, J.R.
J.R.: How you doing?

19:48.883 --> 19:52.452
Hey, Cam, I've been
noticing some tension

19:52.495 --> 19:53.931
with your line brothers
this past week or two.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.281
Cam: No, big brother,
sir. There's no--

19:55.324 --> 19:56.630
Hey, hey, chill.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.371
I just want to talk
to you as a friend.

19:58.414 --> 20:01.330
You can't be my friend
and my DP.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.027
That right there
is why the guys are
trippin' on me.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.290
They said that?

20:05.552 --> 20:07.554
OK, fine. I'm your DP now.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.730
And you better
tell me everything.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.036
Look, it's not about
what they're saying.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.691
My line brothers keep
driving off campus
somewhere together.

20:14.735 --> 20:18.956
Is that why they
were dragging today
and where Lou got the limp?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.569
Look, I know I wanted
to join KEK at first
for the scholarships,

20:22.612 --> 20:24.745
but now I see
it's more than that,

20:24.788 --> 20:26.573
and I want to be a part
of this brotherhood.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.444
I was tight with
my line brothers,

20:28.488 --> 20:30.011
but now there's distance
with some of them,

20:30.054 --> 20:31.969
and they gonna keep
widening that distance

20:32.013 --> 20:33.362
if you don't start
treating me
like everybody else.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.059
I do treat you
like everybody else.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.887
Really? Have you had this
conversation with Perry?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.280
He's the ace.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.763
Go study, man.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.373
You're dismissed.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.419
Yes, big brother, sir.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.774
Amara: What about that one?
The Edelman grant.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.907
It says it's
specifically for schools
with under 5,000 students.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.736
True, but it has
STEM requirements.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.738
That building
Marcus is going rogue

21:01.782 --> 21:03.827
to help you steal from
the Athletics Department,

21:03.871 --> 21:07.222
will it have a science or
an engineering component?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.658
I don't--
[Cell phone chimes]

21:15.361 --> 21:20.409
Oh. I'm sorry.
I will put that on silent.
OK, what were you...

21:20.453 --> 21:22.324
Or you could tell me
who was texting you.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.500
Girl, heh.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.938
I have all night.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.941
It's...Zeke.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.509
I've been seeing him
for a couple months.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.164
Seeing him?

21:36.207 --> 21:38.209
Is it serious?

21:38.253 --> 21:40.299
Kind of.
But, suddenly,

21:40.342 --> 21:43.127
Marcus is back
in the picture.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.825
He kissed me,
and now I have

21:44.868 --> 21:46.957
two viable
romantic interests

21:47.001 --> 21:48.437
and no idea what to do.

21:48.481 --> 21:49.699
Yes, girl.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.006
Show these young hos
how we do it!

21:52.049 --> 21:53.399
OK, you see?

21:53.442 --> 21:55.314
This is why I don't tell
you things, Candace.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.706
Just let me have this.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.405
Start from
the beginning.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.711
Don't leave
anything out.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.975
[Sighs]

22:05.019 --> 22:07.804
Distract me.
What are you writing?

22:07.848 --> 22:09.850
I'm writing a essay about

22:09.893 --> 22:12.331
a public health crisis
that personally
affects me.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.158
So, my topic
is nutrition.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.334
Professor Walton?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.944
Mm-hmm.

22:16.987 --> 22:20.339
You do you,
but Walton loves
out-of-the-box thinking.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.210
When I took that class,
I wrote about

22:22.253 --> 22:24.212
midterm stress
as a health crisis.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.388
He ate it up.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.650
Thanks.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.568
[Cell phone vibrating]

22:32.612 --> 22:35.745
Oh. I've gotta
take this.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.575
Hey. OK, please tell me
something good.

22:39.619 --> 22:42.012
I'm so sorry,
but my connection
hit a dead end.

22:42.056 --> 22:45.407
No idea who posted
about the hookup
on Yard Yack.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.017
So, that's it?
My business is just

22:47.061 --> 22:48.758
out on the streets for
people to speculate about,

22:48.802 --> 22:50.369
and there's
nothing I can do?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.805
Well, first of all,

22:51.848 --> 22:53.372
I'll remind you again
that the post

22:53.415 --> 22:54.895
doesn't specifically
name you.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.766
And, second, there are
two things you can do,

22:56.810 --> 22:58.420
but you're not gonna
like either one of them.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.074
Try me.
I'm desperate.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.815
Get real with yourself.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.773
You're working
yourself up over
who made the post

23:03.817 --> 23:06.210
as a way to avoid what's
really bothering you--

23:06.254 --> 23:07.864
why you kissed Damon.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.649
Nate, I cannot think
about Damon right now,

23:09.692 --> 23:12.347
so next.
What's the other option?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.044
Get ahead of it.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.698
If there's someone
who shouldn't find out

23:15.742 --> 23:17.221
from Yard Yack,
you should tell them.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.441
Well, you were right.
Both of those options sucked.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.575
But you tried,
so thanks.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.882
OK, guys, so,
I really messed up.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.710
I think the Yard Yack
post is about me

23:27.754 --> 23:29.233
and Aqueelah's gonna
find out anyway,

23:29.277 --> 23:31.540
so we'll either
all be taking this L,

23:31.584 --> 23:32.715
or she'll just
be done with it

23:32.759 --> 23:34.543
and then kick me
off the line.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.066
I know it was
a dumb mistake,

23:36.110 --> 23:38.939
but it's just gonna
blow everything up.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.331
Screw it.

23:40.375 --> 23:44.553
I told my boyfriend
I couldn't see him
for 6 weeks.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.600
We only lasted 4 days.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.560
[Laughter]

23:52.779 --> 23:56.565
Melody: Well, um,
sometimes I, um...

23:56.609 --> 23:59.263
wear makeup when
I'm alone at night,

23:59.307 --> 24:02.049
like, lashes and everything.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.485
[Laughter]

24:03.529 --> 24:05.618
Well, I'm glad
to know our ace
isn't perfect.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.055
Well, I guess
we all make mistakes.

24:08.098 --> 24:11.014
Simone: Yeah.
[Laughter]

24:11.058 --> 24:14.714
Melody: Yeah, well,
whatever happens, we got you.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.630
Yup.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.546
[Laughter]

24:21.460 --> 24:23.418
Thanks, guys.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.471
Woman: There's a new
post on Yard Yack

24:32.514 --> 24:34.516
about the athlete
hookup. Wait.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.127
This is
about Blake Foster,
the basketball player,

24:37.171 --> 24:38.868
and Zoe Clark,
a volleyball player.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.436
Jeanelle: And Zoe's the one
that made the update.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.307
So she just outed herself?

24:43.351 --> 24:45.527
Yeah. "If you find
this entertaining,
go touch some grass,

24:45.571 --> 24:47.573
'cause it's toxic.
You're talking about
a real person. Me."

24:47.616 --> 24:50.401
That's bold. Don't know
if I would've had
the ovaries to do that.

24:50.445 --> 24:51.794
Yeah, why did she do that?

24:51.838 --> 24:54.841
You're in the clear,
so does it matter?

24:56.843 --> 25:00.150
Yeah. I think it does.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.112
[Nathaniel clears throat]

25:08.594 --> 25:10.683
Hey, uh, Nate.
Have you seen Simone?

25:10.726 --> 25:12.249
She's not answering
any of my texts.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.034
Uh, I think
she's still studying.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.820
Hey, um,
how was the event?

25:17.864 --> 25:20.562
It ended early.
Nico offered free food,

25:20.606 --> 25:23.826
and, unfortunately,
I can't compete with
all of that noise.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.654
Sorry to hear that.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.569
Look, I know you would've
been a great president.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.746
Child, I know.
That's why I'm
keeping the faith.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.661
Being president
will be

25:32.705 --> 25:35.011
a part of my journey
here at Bringston.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.840
So it's that easy
for you to keep believing?

25:37.884 --> 25:41.148
"Hebrews" 11:1.

25:41.191 --> 25:44.194
"Now faith is
the substance of
things hoped for,

25:44.238 --> 25:46.849
the evidence of
things not seen."

25:46.893 --> 25:48.547
Ever since I came
to BU,

25:48.590 --> 25:50.070
I've been
searching for my path,

25:50.113 --> 25:53.029
and, well, I think
student government is it.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.075
So, yeah, the polls may
have me down this time,

25:55.118 --> 25:58.600
but next year?
Oh, just watch me.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.384
So, wait.
Are you talking about

26:00.428 --> 26:02.125
the polls in
the school papers?

26:02.169 --> 26:03.910
Yeah. They offered
the candidates
all the raw data,

26:03.953 --> 26:05.564
but I'm not sure
what to do with it.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.783
Mind if I take a look?

26:07.827 --> 26:09.263
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.614
All right.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.575
All right.
They polled 500 students,

26:16.618 --> 26:19.360
and everyone
who took the poll got
to rank their choices.

26:19.403 --> 26:22.015
All right. I could use...

26:22.972 --> 26:25.061
plurality with
elimination method

26:25.105 --> 26:27.934
and see if it
tells us anything.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.505
Now let's see what happens
when we drop out

26:34.549 --> 26:36.420
the lowest-polling
candidate.

26:36.464 --> 26:40.424
Yo, 29 of their voters picked
you as their second choice.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.905
If we add all that up...

26:42.949 --> 26:45.516
the race is much closer
than you think. Look.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.041
Nate, you slide
into second place.

26:48.084 --> 26:52.393
Nico with 137 votes
and you with 135.

26:54.221 --> 26:57.877
Uh, look, my bad
if I overstepped.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.662
Please. You can
math-splain to me anytime.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.057
That is the fastest
my faith has ever
been justified.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.973
You told me everything
I needed

27:07.016 --> 27:08.844
to stay competitive
in the race.

27:11.325 --> 27:14.067
And you just helped me
solve my midterm.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.374
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

27:21.335 --> 27:24.773
Everybody besides Cam and Zaire,
stand up.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.126
Hey, bro,
let's have a sidebar.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.477
Nah. There's been
enough stuff going
on in secret.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.523
You been holding
a separate
underground line

27:35.566 --> 27:38.091
for these pledges?

27:38.134 --> 27:40.180
And before you open
your mouth and lie...

27:41.398 --> 27:43.705
just know it'll
make it worse.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.229
So, am I right?

27:47.404 --> 27:49.319
Somebody had to show them
what it really takes

27:49.363 --> 27:50.930
to become a KEK brother.

27:54.847 --> 27:57.023
You know, I'm
disappointed in y'all.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.720
One--for betraying
your fellow line brother

27:58.764 --> 28:01.201
and two--for thinking you
could sneak behind my back.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.811
I'm the DP!

28:02.855 --> 28:05.031
You should've
come to me.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.078
All y'all are
dropped from this line.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.868
Big brother J.R.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.261
With all due respect,

28:18.305 --> 28:20.786
I can't let my brothers
go out like that.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.701
We all started
this process together,

28:22.744 --> 28:24.354
and while I do
feel betrayed

28:24.398 --> 28:26.139
by some of
my brothers,

28:26.182 --> 28:28.097
one thing you always
taught us is

28:28.141 --> 28:30.230
to stick by
our brothers' side,

28:30.273 --> 28:32.885
especially when our backs
are against the wall.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.714
One of
our brother's mistakes

28:35.757 --> 28:37.237
is all of our mistakes.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.109
So, if you
gonna drop them...

28:41.371 --> 28:43.417
you gonna have to
drop the whole line.

one last chance

of this happening again,

all y'all are gonna be done.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.283
And that's a promise.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.867
It's not a mansion.
I told you

29:41.910 --> 29:43.564
not to put that
on the list.

OK. Now Marcus.

He's inspiring,
supportive,

29:54.836 --> 29:56.490
tender, nostalgic.

29:56.533 --> 30:01.103
We just--we have
so much history
together.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.801
He's the one that got away.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.673
Technically,
he let me get away.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.240
But he realized
his mistake.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.763
At the worst
possible time.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.244
I'm essentially
his boss.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.985
Candace, I can't
go down that road.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.683
I'd look
unprofessional
and unethical.

Zoe? Hey.
Um, I was wondering

30:42.884 --> 30:44.146
if I could talk to you
about Yard Yack

30:44.190 --> 30:45.887
for an essay
that I'm writing.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.846
I already said
all I needed to
say in my post.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.283
I respect that.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.980
I just wanted to
let you know that

30:52.024 --> 30:55.070
I thought that what
you did was badass

30:55.114 --> 30:56.942
and I hope you find
your peace.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.205
I did.

the post was about me.

For a second,
I kinda thought

31:11.217 --> 31:13.610
the post was about me.

31:13.654 --> 31:16.178
My anxiety was next-level.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.833
That app is
literally the worst.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.183
The worst...

31:21.227 --> 31:22.881
but damn addicting.

I mean,
if I don't check it,
I get major FOMO,

31:25.057 --> 31:26.972
and if I do check it,
I start comparing
myself to everyone.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.409
Same.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.934
I have to write a paper
about a public health crisis,

31:32.978 --> 31:34.675

to find a topic

I was living through one

31:36.633 --> 31:38.331

That's the essay I wanted
to talk to you about.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.120
I guess we both
learned our lesson,

31:45.164 --> 31:46.426
and we will
be deleting the app

31:46.469 --> 31:47.906
off our phones
forever, right?

a silver lining
in it for me.

weren't doing
anything wrong.

He's single, I'm single.

That post just
made me realize that

32:00.179 --> 32:02.703
I needed to be honest
about what I wanted,

32:02.746 --> 32:05.053
with him
and with myself.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.498
I heard your conversation
with Damon earlier.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.544
I'm very sensitive
to loud sounds.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.111
Wilinda, this is
not the time.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.678
Why? Because you're
waiting on Kwame Evans?

32:21.722 --> 32:24.116
And as soon as he gets here,
you'll remind him

32:24.159 --> 32:25.900
that he's
the lowest-polling candidate

32:25.944 --> 32:27.336
and ask him to drop
out of the race?

32:27.380 --> 32:28.947
OK. So, I'm gonna
need you

32:28.990 --> 32:30.818
to use your powers
of eavesdropping

32:30.861 --> 32:33.168
for good and not evil.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.431
I did. I already
talked to Kwame.

32:35.475 --> 32:40.480
He's dropping out,
and I am, too.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.090
Now, why would
you do that?

32:42.134 --> 32:43.787
I only decided
to run for president

32:43.831 --> 32:46.486
because no one on campus
was talking about faith.

32:46.529 --> 32:47.791
But you are.

32:47.835 --> 32:50.533
And you've got the best
chance of beating Nico.

That's--that's
very gracious of you.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.800
For the record,
I always admired

your campaign slogan:

32:58.367 --> 33:00.630
"Never Too Old
to Vote Young."

33:00.674 --> 33:03.459
And--and your posters
were always on point, too.

33:03.503 --> 33:06.419
I wish I could say
the same about yours.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.551
Your slogan could've
been better.

33:08.595 --> 33:11.076
And here I was mistaking
this for a nice moment.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.469
Like, why don't you
incorporate your first name?

33:13.513 --> 33:16.081
"Accept Your Fate.
Vote for Nate."

33:16.124 --> 33:18.822
Or "President Nate
Will Be First-Rate."

33:18.866 --> 33:20.259
It's really a no-brainer.

Oh, and one more thing:
You're spending

33:21.695 --> 33:24.132

ignoring the athletes.

golf team to back me.

33:30.312 --> 33:34.273

joined my campaign?

33:35.535 --> 33:37.711
Well, now that
you mention it,

campaign manager.

I should talk to Simone.

what happened was real.

I'm not sure I follow.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.715

I've been worried that

34:25.759 --> 34:29.284
my dad's death
was affecting my
decisions and thoughts,

34:29.328 --> 34:32.070
but I passed my midterm.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.072
Like, I didn't fail
because of grief.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.205
So, that means
that what happened,
you know, between us

34:37.248 --> 34:38.946
wasn't grief, either.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.426
It was real. Heh!

the take-away
from all of this.

chapter in jeopardy.

about Damon.

with him?

aware of the incident

35:44.881 --> 35:47.145

a baseball player,
and a pair of lips?

35:47.188 --> 35:48.624
Nah. Damon was
about to tell me,

35:48.668 --> 35:50.931
but then
he got interrupted.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.759
I got caught up with
some KEK stuff today.
What's going on?

Well, let me tell you
what I've noticed.

Simone on the verge of
breaking down,

35:57.242 --> 35:58.721
unable to confront
her feelings,

35:58.765 --> 36:01.289
and then Damon
waxing poetic about grief

36:01.333 --> 36:03.030
and--and trying to
connect these dots

36:03.073 --> 36:04.466
that may not
even be there.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.076
This isn't good
for either one of them.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.687
And it's not
good for Damon.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.037
He needs our chosen family
now more than anything.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.866
It's the strength
of our friendship
that get us through.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.824
Do you remember
what happened when
we lost family dinner?

36:14.868 --> 36:18.393
Everything went to hell.
J.R., I think we have
to do something

36:18.437 --> 36:21.353
because, eventually,
Simone and Damon
are gonna talk.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.006
What's your suggestion?

36:23.050 --> 36:25.095
That if we love them

36:25.139 --> 36:26.488
and want to
spare them heartache,

36:26.532 --> 36:29.491
then we stop them from
doing something stupid,

36:29.535 --> 36:31.058
like turning
a grief-filled kiss
into something

36:31.101 --> 36:34.409
that will torpedo
their friendship
and all of ours.

show up unannounced.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.773
It's OK.
Come on in.

36:56.388 --> 37:00.435
I need to be completely
honest about something.

37:00.479 --> 37:03.525
I'm seeing someone else.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.618
I knew that was
a possibility...

37:10.793 --> 37:13.753
but I'm willing to
fight for us, Amara.

37:15.537 --> 37:19.367
Two days ago, you said
something about timing,

37:19.411 --> 37:22.675
and I'm--I'm afraid
we missed our moment.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.764
I don't believe that.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.549
Look, I've done
the work in therapy,

37:27.593 --> 37:30.291
and it made me
want something real.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.901
It's what we had before.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.947
I admit it was real,

37:33.990 --> 37:37.298
but I can't ignore
the fact that I'm your boss.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.779
There's gotta be
a loophole

37:39.822 --> 37:42.390
to allow us
to work together,

37:42.434 --> 37:43.870
to be together.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.307
We just have
to find it, Amara...

37:48.701 --> 37:50.964
if it's what you want.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.409
It's what I want.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.331
J.R.: Damon, what up, bro?

38:10.375 --> 38:12.202
What's up, man?

38:13.813 --> 38:15.423
Find a way to raise
your GPA yet?

38:15.467 --> 38:19.035
Actually, I fixed
my midterm grade,

38:19.079 --> 38:20.559
and now I'm not
riding the bench, baby.

Thank you, man.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.696

is talk to Simone.

38:27.740 --> 38:28.828
Hmm.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.656
Bro, this whole time
I've been trying

38:30.699 --> 38:33.615
to convince myself
that it's not right,

38:33.659 --> 38:35.965
but nothing feels more
right than her, man.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.141
J., I think I'm
gonna tell her that

38:38.185 --> 38:39.447
she's the one for me.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.667
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

38:43.451 --> 38:45.018
Where you been?

38:45.061 --> 38:46.411

my midterm paper,

through it today,

38:53.331 --> 38:54.506
but you seem better.

38:54.549 --> 38:58.336
Yeah. I'm feeling better.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.642
I realized I don't regret

39:00.686 --> 39:03.471
what happened between
me and Damon.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.168
It meant something.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.345
I don't know what,
but it definitely
did mean something,

39:07.388 --> 39:08.998

figure out the rest.

you should hit
pause on that.

your father, bro.

twisted. I love Simone.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.495
But if and when you
start something with her,

39:27.539 --> 39:29.192
you don't ever want
to question the timing.

39:29.236 --> 39:32.282
Plus, you're on line,
so that means no boys.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.807
J.R.: I mean, not to mention,
Thea, your ex,

39:34.850 --> 39:36.852
Simone's teammate
and sometimes friend.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.028
Don't you think you're
moving on a little too fast?

39:39.072 --> 39:41.074
Nathaniel: And I know
you claim, "I'm not
worried about her,"

39:41.117 --> 39:43.032
but I know you
well enough to know
that that isn't true.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.339
J.R.: It might be different
if Simone was a random girl,

39:45.383 --> 39:46.862
but if she don't feel the same,

39:46.906 --> 39:48.864
you could lose
one of your best friends.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.083
Uh...

39:50.126 --> 39:52.041
look, uh, you wanna
give me a minute?

39:52.085 --> 39:55.436
I guess I just have
some things to think about.

39:56.916 --> 40:00.049
♪ I'm only
getting half of you ♪

40:00.093 --> 40:03.575

40:07.492 --> 40:08.449
Hey.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.929
Hey.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.713
Thanks for coming.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.411
I just needed
to clear my head.

40:13.454 --> 40:16.892
Yeah. I mean,
today was wild.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.764
Mm.

40:18.807 --> 40:21.549
I'm glad that
that Yard Yack stuff
wasn't about us, though.

40:21.593 --> 40:23.769
Ha ha! Me, too.

40:25.858 --> 40:29.470
And I'm sorry that
I overreacted about it.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.037
I just was
trying to process

40:31.080 --> 40:33.692
what happened
between us and...

40:33.735 --> 40:35.389
I just couldn't handle
everyone knowing my business

40:35.433 --> 40:38.131
when I didn't even know
my feelings about it,
you know?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.831
Yeah. I do. Heh.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.231
Do you know now?

40:51.274 --> 40:53.146
Yeah.

40:56.018 --> 40:59.152
You needed comfort
in that moment,

40:59.195 --> 41:01.284
and I was there
for you.

41:01.328 --> 41:05.201
And I'm happy
that I was able
to be there for you,

41:05.245 --> 41:09.379
but we're friends...

41:09.423 --> 41:10.990
and that's all.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.865

41:26.919 --> 41:29.312
I had a pretty

41:29.356 --> 41:32.315
and you were there
for me, so thank you.

41:32.359 --> 41:35.101
Of course.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.103
I'm really glad we're
on the same page.
