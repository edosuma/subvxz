WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.210
OH, CHECK OUT WHAT I'VE
DONE WITH MY LOCKER!

00:11.279 --> 00:12.646
* TAH-DAH!

00:14.282 --> 00:16.015
HERE'S WHERE
I KEEP MY BOOKS.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.152
DOWN HERE I KEEP
RANDOM STRANDS OF
HAIR I'VE COLLECTED

00:18.186 --> 00:20.288
TO MAKE FAKE MUSTACHES.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.058
AND HERE IS WHERE I
STOCKPILE OLD LUNCHES,

00:24.092 --> 00:26.760
OR, AS I LIKE TO CALL IT,
MY TUM-TUM YUM-YUMS.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.599
HEY, LEO.
WHAT'S THAT?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.134
MY PROGRESS REPORT.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.635
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY SCIENCE TEACHER

00:34.668 --> 00:36.504
SAYS I'M ALWAYS
LATE TO CLASS.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.306
YOU ARE ALWAYS
LATE TO CLASS.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.341
I KNOW THAT, BUT I
DON'T NEED IT PUBLICIZED.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.145
LOOK AT THIS!

00:44.178 --> 00:45.646
AN "A-MINUS"!

00:45.679 --> 00:48.216
I KNEW MY HOME EC TEACHER
HAD IT OUT FOR ME.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.751
ALWAYS CRITICIZING
MY MUFFINS.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.687
HA HA! I BEAT YOU!
I GOT A "D-PLUS"!

00:53.721 --> 00:55.556
"PLUS"
BECAUSE I'M BETTER!

00:55.589 --> 00:59.227
ADAM, THE "PLUS" IS--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.229
IT'S JUST NOT EVEN
WORTH IT ANYMORE.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.565
"D" IS NOT A GOOD GRADE,

01:04.598 --> 01:07.067
BUT WE DON'T REALLY
EXPECT YOU TO GET GOOD GRADES.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.805
I'M ENGINEERED TO BE
THE SMARTEST PERSON
ON THE PLANET,

01:11.839 --> 01:13.541
AND I JUST GOT
AN "A-MINUS."

01:13.574 --> 01:15.476
I'VE BEEN RELEGATED
TO THE HUDDLED,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.711
UNWASHED MASSES
OF MINUSES,

01:17.745 --> 01:18.746
LIKE YOU!

01:20.080 --> 01:23.217
CHASE, I KNOW THIS
MUST BE HARD FOR YOU,

01:23.251 --> 01:25.085
BUT, I MEAN,
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE--

01:25.119 --> 01:27.655
SEEING YOU FALL
FLAT ON YOUR FACE
IS REALLY FUN FOR US!

01:29.357 --> 01:32.693
I HAVE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO RECLAIM MY SUPERIORITY.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.496
WELL, YOU COULD SIGN UP
FOR THE STUDENT OF
THE SEMESTER COMPETITION.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.797
WHAT'S THAT?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.732
EVERY SEMESTER,
KIDS COMPETE TO SEE

01:38.766 --> 01:40.268
WHO CAN BEST IMPROVE
THE SCHOOL.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.570
WHOEVER
GETS THE MOST VOTES
WINS FREE PENCILS,

01:42.603 --> 01:45.573
A BUMPER STICKER,
AND A CHEESY PICTURE
OF HIMSELF ON THE WALL!

01:46.607 --> 01:49.610
AND THAT CHEESY PICTURE
WILL SHOW EVERYONE

01:49.643 --> 01:52.079
THAT MY BRILLIANCE
REIGNS SUPREME!

01:52.112 --> 01:55.383
I CALL YOUR FREE PENCILS!

01:55.416 --> 01:58.486
NO, WAIT, I'LL TAKE
THE CHEESY PICTURE.
THEY BOTH SOUND SO GOOD!

01:58.519 --> 01:59.753
( class bell rings )

01:59.787 --> 02:01.322
Both: RACE YA'!

02:03.424 --> 02:05.226
OH, NO. SCIENCE CLASS
IS ALL THE WAY

02:05.259 --> 02:06.760
AT THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE SCHOOL.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.330
IF I'M LATE AGAIN,
I'M GONNA GET DETENTION.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.865
UNLESS...

02:13.734 --> 02:15.503
UNLESS WHAT?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.371
I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND CRAZY,

02:17.405 --> 02:18.806
BUT CAN YOU USE
YOUR BIONIC SPEED

02:18.839 --> 02:20.708
TO ROCKET ME OVER
TO SCIENCE CLASS

02:20.741 --> 02:23.377
WHILE I RIDE ON YOUR
BACK LIKE A FIGHTER PILOT?

02:23.411 --> 02:25.446
WHAT?

02:25.479 --> 02:26.580
NO WAY.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.717
PLEEEAAASE?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.685
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'LL MAKE IT ON TIME.

02:31.719 --> 02:35.489
LEO, I'M A GIRL,
NOT A METHOD OF
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.727
BESIDES, NO ONE CAN
SEE ME USING MY BIONICS.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.829
BUT-- BUT THERE'S
NO ONE AROUND. COME ON!

02:41.862 --> 02:43.697
IF I DON'T MAKE IT,
I'M GONNA BE IN
BIG TROUBLE!

02:43.731 --> 02:45.633
DO YOU REALLY WANT THAT
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE?

02:45.666 --> 02:48.336
I CAN LIVE WITH IT.

02:51.239 --> 02:54.775
FINE. I GUESS I JUST
EXPECTED MORE FROM MY...

02:54.808 --> 02:56.344
SISTER.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.684
OKAY, FINE.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.519
BUT JUST THIS ONCE.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.855
HOLD ON.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.628
OW.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.399
WHAT PART OF "HOLD ON"
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

03:18.432 --> 03:21.201
I'M SORRY, THIS IS
MY FIRST TIME GOING
"BREE-BACK" RIDING!

03:22.670 --> 03:24.505
WHOO-HOO!

03:24.538 --> 03:27.641
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.610
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

03:29.643 --> 03:31.712
FASTER, SMARTER--

03:31.745 --> 03:34.348
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:34.382 --> 03:36.517
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.853
**

03:44.825 --> 03:46.794
All: AAAAHHH!

04:14.522 --> 04:15.956
HEY, VOTE FOR CHASE.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.291
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.595
VOTE FOR CHASE FOR
STUDENT OF THE SEMESTER.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.397
HERE'S MY WEBSITE,
WHERE YOU CAN

04:23.431 --> 04:26.400
PERUSE MY PLATFORM,
MARVEL AT MY SKILLS,

04:26.434 --> 04:28.502
OR EVEN PLAY A GAME
OF CHASE TRIVIA,

04:28.536 --> 04:30.671
WHERE ALL THE ANSWERS
ARE ABOUT ME.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.343
HEY!

04:38.011 --> 04:39.680
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.049
WHAT DO I THINK,
OR WHAT'S APPROPRIATE
TO SAY TO YOUR FACE?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.653
"CHASE THE DREAM"?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.355
PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THESE
TO ANYONE

04:47.388 --> 04:48.822
I MIGHT WANT
TO BECOME FRIENDS WITH.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.260
I'VE GOT A WHOLE PLAN.
CHECK IT OUT.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.528
I EVEN LINKED THE LATEST
FACIAL RECOGNITION

04:54.562 --> 04:56.730
SOFTWARE
TO THE SCHOOL DATABASE

04:56.764 --> 05:00.534
TO CREATE A LASER AUTOMATED
ATTENDANCE SYSTEM.

05:00.568 --> 05:04.872
ANDREW LAMB HAS BEEN LATE
 THREE DAYS IN A ROW.

05:07.775 --> 05:11.479
STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCIPAL'S
OFFICE, ANDY.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.884
HE'LL THANK ME LATER FOR
PUTTING HIM ON THE RIGHT PATH.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.687
OH, DUDE, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA WIN WITH THAT.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.623
KIDS WANT FUN STUFF
LIKE JACUZZIS IN MATH CLASS

05:22.656 --> 05:24.558
AND HALLWAYS PAVED WITH CANDY.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.627
OOH, AND I ALSO THINK
BIOLOGY WOULD BE

05:26.660 --> 05:28.729
A LOT MORE FUN IF WE
COULD JUGGLE THE FROGS

05:28.762 --> 05:30.698
BEFORE WE DISSECTED THEM.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.000
THAT'S FROG ABUSE.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.468
FINE, WE'LL DO IT AFTER,

05:34.502 --> 05:36.670
BUT IT'S GONNA GET MESSY.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.375
OOH, TURKEY!

05:41.409 --> 05:42.643
OOH! GRAVY!

05:47.648 --> 05:49.583
STEP AWAY FROM THE GRAVY!

05:49.617 --> 05:52.786
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO, TURKEY!

05:52.820 --> 05:55.756
ADAM, THAT'S MY
NUTRITIONAL SCANNER,

05:55.789 --> 05:58.592
INSURING THAT EVERYONE GETS
A PERFECTLY BALANCED...

05:58.626 --> 06:00.461
OHH.ITIOUS LUNCH.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.930
CHASE, I DON'T THINK
YOUR SCANNER'S A VERY
GOOD IDEA.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.566
OF COURSE IT IS!
WHO DOESN'T LOVE

06:05.599 --> 06:07.501
BEING TOLD HOW TO
EAT PROPERLY?

06:07.535 --> 06:11.639
( chime )
 MORE GREEN BEANS?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.707
TOO MANY FRIES.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.677
A CUPCAKE? REALLY?
 I WOULDN'T,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.679
BUT IT'S YOUR HEALTH.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.348
CHASE, YOU'RE GOING
ABOUT THIS ALL WRONG.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.417
LET ME HELP!

06:23.451 --> 06:25.686
LOOK, I KNOW HOW
TO WIN YOU VOTES.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.555
( dance music playing )

06:27.588 --> 06:31.425
EVERYONE SAY HELLO
TO DEEJAY JERSEY CHASE!

06:31.459 --> 06:34.127
ADAM, WHAT IS GOING ON?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.063
I'M HELPING YOU WIN!
OR SHOULD I SAY...

06:36.096 --> 06:37.931
( amplified )
I'M HELPING YOU WIN!

06:37.965 --> 06:41.802
I DO NOT NEED
A CHEESY DEEJAY SETUP!

06:41.835 --> 06:44.972
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT YOU THIS
AWESOME DEEJAY SETUP!

06:45.005 --> 06:48.576
IT'S A LUNCHTIME
DANCE PARTY!

06:48.609 --> 06:52.680
GO GRAVY! GO GRAVY!
GO GRAVY! GO GRAVY!

06:52.713 --> 06:54.782
GO GRAVY! GO GRAVY!

06:54.815 --> 06:55.816
GO GRAVY!

06:55.849 --> 06:57.117
GO GRAVY! GO GRAVY!

06:57.150 --> 06:58.786
GO GRAVY!

07:03.657 --> 07:05.125
( class bell rings )

07:05.158 --> 07:07.828
SHOOT! I'M GONNA BE
LATE AGAIN!

07:11.499 --> 07:13.000
HEY, BREE, BUDDY,

07:13.033 --> 07:14.835
MY BEAUTIFUL
BIONIC BESTIE.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.937
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN SPIN THOSE
LITTLE TOE WHEELS

07:16.970 --> 07:18.739
AND SHOOT ME OVER
TO SCIENCE CLASS AGAIN?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.041
SORRY, I'M ON MY WAY
TO STUDY HALL WITH ETHAN.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.644
WE'VE GOT TO GO GET READY
FOR A BIG ALGEBRA TEST.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.913
COME ON, BREE, WE'D
BETTER GO OR WE WON'T
GET SEATS TOGETHER,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.682
AND WHEN I'M MINUS YOU,
I'M NEGATIVE.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.984
PLEEEAAASE?

07:31.018 --> 07:32.753
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.956
I'M FEELIN' THE NEED--
THE NEED FOR BREE SPEED.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.627
LEO, I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT YOUR BIONIC TAXI.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.161
I DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE A TAXI.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.030
YOU'RE MORE LIKE
A CUTE LITTLE TROLLEY

07:43.063 --> 07:44.765
WITHOUT THE BELL
AND ANNOYING STOPS.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.668
I TOLD YOU, NO.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.004
HEY!

07:51.038 --> 07:52.840
WHY DON'T I JUST SKIP
SCIENCE CLASS

07:52.873 --> 07:54.508
AND HANG OUT
WITH YOU AND ETHAN?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.977
YOU KNOW, WE CAN
STUDY AND LAUGH

07:57.010 --> 07:58.846
AND TALK ALL ABOUT
HOW YOU CAN PERFORM

07:58.879 --> 08:00.581
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
WITH YOUR ARMPIT.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.682
ETHAN!

08:01.715 --> 08:03.150
GO TO STUDY HALL.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.852
BUGO.--

08:04.885 --> 08:07.054
OKAY, BUT I'LL BE
THINKING ABOUT YOU
THE WHOLE WAY THERE,

08:07.087 --> 08:08.989
MY LITTLE COEFFICIENT.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.025
AWW! ONE PLUS ONE
EQUALS YOU AND ME!

08:12.059 --> 08:14.628
( chuckles )
OHH!

08:14.662 --> 08:17.665
YOU TWO HAVE A WEIRD
LITTLE THING GOING ON.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.200
HOP ON.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.073
HI-HO, SILVER!

08:26.106 --> 08:28.576
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHENEVER YOU'RE
FEELIN' IT.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.744
WHOO-HOO!

08:36.850 --> 08:39.986
( whistling )

08:40.020 --> 08:41.922
HEY!

08:41.955 --> 08:44.224
OOOWWW!

08:44.256 --> 08:46.694
ADAM, FOR THE LAST TIME,

08:46.727 --> 08:48.896
THAT IS NOT
A GIANT LUNCHBOX!

08:48.929 --> 08:50.664
NO!

08:50.698 --> 08:52.499
IT'S PART OF YOUR
NEW CAMPAIGN TO WIN

08:52.532 --> 08:53.667
STUDENT OF THE SEMESTER.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.035
I-- I MEAN YOU--

08:55.068 --> 08:56.904
PUT A VENDING MACHINE
IN STUDY HALL.

08:56.937 --> 09:00.674
BUT THOSE AREN'T
EVEN HEALTHY FOODS.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.942
IS THAT KEY LIME PIE?

09:01.975 --> 09:04.912
I DON'T KNOW.
GIMME A BUCK
AND I'LL FIND OUT.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.216
THEY LOVE IT!

09:09.249 --> 09:10.918
OF COURSE THEY DO.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.588
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR
MEAL FROM A MACHINE.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.556
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK
YOU NEEDED MY HELP.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.925
I'M TOTALLY GONNA
WIN THIS THING FOR YOU.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.229
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.665
YOU'RE GONNA WIN
THIS THING FOR ME?

09:24.698 --> 09:27.735
YEAH, I JUST SAID THAT.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.903
DON'T YOU THINK YOUR
SUDDEN POPULARITY

09:29.937 --> 09:31.805
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MY IDEAS?

09:31.839 --> 09:32.840
NO.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.875
I THINK THAT PEOPLE
ARE FINALLY REALIZING

09:34.908 --> 09:36.844
MY CAMPAIGN SLOGAN,

09:36.877 --> 09:38.946
"CHASE THE DREAM,"

09:38.979 --> 09:40.047
IS ABOUT ME.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.249
I AM THE DREAM!

09:43.717 --> 09:46.286
IT WORKS ON A LOT OF LEVELS.
DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.256
BUT MY STRATEGY
WAS TEN TIMES BETTER.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.958
YOU JUST CAN'T DEAL
WITH THE FACT THAT

09:50.991 --> 09:52.860
I'M FINALLY SMARTER
AT SOMETHING THAN YOU ARE.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.895
OH, REALLY?
TEN TIMES BETTER?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.931
WHAT'D YOU USE,
ALL YOUR FINGERS AND TOES
TO COUNT THAT ONE OUT?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.934
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:00.968 --> 10:03.070
YOU ALWAYS TREAT ME
LIKE AN IDIOT.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.605
BUT NOT THIS TIME
BECAUSE I'M ENTERING
THIS CONTEST,

10:05.639 --> 10:06.807
AND I'M TAKING YOU DOWN.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.975
YOU WOULDN'T.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.943
ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?
I JUST SAID I WOULD!

10:19.787 --> 10:21.922
HERE YOU GO.
VOTE FOR CHASE.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.691
HERE YOU GO.
VOTE FOR CHASE.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.959
AND DON'T FORGET TO STOP
BY THE NURSE'S OFFICE

10:25.993 --> 10:27.761
FOR YOUR FREE
SCOLIOSIS SCREENING,

10:27.795 --> 10:30.230
SPONSORED BY...

10:30.263 --> 10:32.800
( horn'SCUSE ME!

10:32.833 --> 10:36.036
COMIN' THROUGH!
WHO WANTS TO RIDE ON
THE HIGH SCHOOL PARTY BUS?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.137
WHOO-HOO!

10:39.740 --> 10:42.943
DO YOU HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT GIVING
KIDS RIDES TO CLASS

10:42.976 --> 10:44.778
IS GONNA MAKE THEM
WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU?

10:44.812 --> 10:48.115
WHO'S GOING TO CLASS?
WE'RE JUST CRUISING
THE HALLS.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.917
HEY, EVERYONE,

10:49.950 --> 10:51.618
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
WALK TO CLASS,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.253
KNOWING YOU'RE
ALSO FITTING IN 2%

10:53.286 --> 10:55.122
OF YOUR DAILY
EXERCISE REQUIREMENT?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.292
NO? OKAY.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.896
ATTENTION,
PARTY-BUSSERS!

11:02.930 --> 11:04.264
THERE WILL BE NO STOPS,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.299
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A RIDE TO CLASS,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.168
PLAN YOUR JUMPS
ACCORDINGLY.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.345
WELL...
MY SCIENTIFIC POLLING,

11:18.378 --> 11:21.148
WHICH CONSISTS OF
ALL YOUR CRUMPLED-UP
BUSINESS CARDS

11:21.181 --> 11:23.717
IN THE TRASHCAN

11:23.751 --> 11:26.219
SHOWS THAT ADAM
IS BEATING YOU BY
A COMFORTABLE MARGIN.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.222
IF I'M GONNA
COMPETE WITH HIM,
I HAVE TO START

11:29.256 --> 11:31.124
THINKING LIKE
A SIMPLEMINDED CREATURE,

11:31.158 --> 11:35.228
ONE WHO GOES THROUGH
THE DAY ON BASIC INSTINCT
AND RANDOM IMPULSE,

11:35.262 --> 11:39.232
LIKE A DOG OR A MONKEY
OR A SEA SLUG.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.269
Both: OR ADAM.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.741
BREE! YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

11:47.775 --> 11:49.309
I LEFT MY GEOMETRY
HOMEWORK AT HOME.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.710
CAN YOU RUN AND GET IT--

11:50.744 --> 11:52.312
YOU KNOW, HOP ON
THE OLD "BREE-WAY"?

11:52.345 --> 11:55.816
I TOLD YOU, I'M DONE
RUNNING YOU AROUND.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.318
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LEO-SIZED DENT
IN MY BACK.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.755
BUT IF I DON'T
TURN IN MY HOMEWORK,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.223
I'M GONNA GET AN "F."

12:03.256 --> 12:05.926
WELL, THEN, MAYBE
NEXT TIME YOU'LL
BE MORE RESPONSIBLE.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.029
NOW, ETHAN'S COMING.
GO... BE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.304
HEY, LEO.
WHERE'S BREE?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.006
BREE...

12:19.039 --> 12:20.774
WENT HOME SICK.

12:20.808 --> 12:24.111
YES, SHE, UH,
SHE HIT HER HEAD...

12:24.144 --> 12:26.279
ON THE WATER FOUNTAIN.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.115
IT HAPPENS.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.250
SHE OKAY?

12:30.283 --> 12:31.318
OH, YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.453
SHE PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN REMEMBER
IT TOMORROW.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.722
DON'T BRING IT UP!

12:35.755 --> 12:38.258
TOOT TOOT!
COMIN' THROUGH!

12:39.492 --> 12:44.131
HEY! HAVE YOU TAKEN
A RIDE ON THE HALLWAY
PARTY BUS YET?

12:44.164 --> 12:46.834
IT'S JUST LIKE
A SUPER-FUN ROLLERCOASTER

12:46.867 --> 12:48.802
WITH A MANIAC AT THE WHEEL!

12:50.170 --> 12:51.471
GO. GO.
GO, GO, GO, GO.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.275
NICE.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.014
HEY, SO, BAD NEWS--

13:01.048 --> 13:03.083
I JUST RAN INTO ETHAN,
AND HE CAN'T MEET UP.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.751
WHAT? WHY?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.419
HE HAD TO GO PLUCK
HIS NOSE HAIRS.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.824
IT WAS LOOKING LIKE
A JUNGLE UP IN THERE.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.362
SO... NOW WILL YOU GO
GET MY HOMEWORK FOR ME?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.031
FINE.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.767
BUT WOULDN'T IT JUST
BE A LOT EASIER FOR ME

13:20.800 --> 13:22.903
TO ZIP INTO
YOUR GEOMETRY CLASS,

13:22.936 --> 13:24.404
MARK AN "A"
IN THE TEACHER'S BOOK,

13:24.437 --> 13:25.472
AND THEN ZIP BACK OUT?

13:25.505 --> 13:26.940
...HEY!

13:26.974 --> 13:29.176
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

13:34.948 --> 13:36.216
LEO, I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.484
I COULDN'T FIND
YOUR STUPID HOMEWORK.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.919
WHAT?

13:43.423 --> 13:47.194
WELL, WILL YOU LOOK
AT THAT?

13:47.227 --> 13:50.864
IT WAS RIGHT HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.835
YOU...

13:55.869 --> 13:57.204
HAVE A NICE DAY.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.906
( horn blows )

14:01.141 --> 14:02.542
( tires screech )

14:02.575 --> 14:04.311
HERE YOU GO, SIR,

14:04.344 --> 14:07.080
THE CORNER OF
CAFETERIA AND BREE.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.349
BREE?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.951
LEO SAID YOU WENT HOME.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.221
WHAT? HE TOLD ME
YOU WERE PLUCKING
YOUR NOSE JUNGLE.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.223
BUT...
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T

14:16.256 --> 14:18.992
BECAUSE IT'S ADORABLE.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.293
UGH. GUESS I WAS WRONG.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.996
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE CORNER
OF AWKWARD AND GROSS.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.900
HERE YOU GO.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.938
ENJOY YOUR
"CHEE-ASE" BURGER!

14:30.971 --> 14:32.372
A HAMBURGER CART?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.007
THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.376
THE ONLY THING JUICIER
THAN MY BURGERS

14:36.409 --> 14:38.045
IS WHAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO EAT,

14:38.078 --> 14:39.446
WHICH IS A BIG,
HEAPING PILE

14:39.479 --> 14:41.915
OF HOT, TASTY DEFEAT.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.284
WELL, SPEAKING OF DEFEAT,

14:44.317 --> 14:45.552
CARE FOR A FOOT RUB?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.389
WHAT'S THAT?

14:49.422 --> 14:52.325
THAT IS MY 2-MINUTE
MASSAGE STOP,

14:52.359 --> 14:55.028
WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS
TEN TOES AT A TIME.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.430
OH, GO AHEAD, PEOPLE.
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.168
MMM, GOOD.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.303
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:03.336 --> 15:04.871
I'VE REALLY HAD IT
WITH YOU.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.508
AWW. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.211
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
CAN'T ENJOY A BURGER

15:11.244 --> 15:13.947
WITHOUT A LITTLE
KETCHUP ON YOUR BUNS.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.483
( squishy sound )

15:16.516 --> 15:19.486
HA! JOKE'S ON YOU.
I KINDA LIKED IT.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.559
AH, THIS IS IT,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.062
THE MOMENT WE'VE
ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.365
( gasps ) THEY FOUND
A TALKING HORSE THAT
FIGHTS CRIME?

15:32.399 --> 15:33.900
NO.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.935
IT'S THE STUDENT OF
THE SEMESTER RESULTS.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.570
MISS THISTLE GETS
TO OPEN THE RESULTS

15:37.604 --> 15:39.672
BECAUSE SHE'S THE OLDEST
TEACHER IN SCHOOL.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.381
OH, JUST GIVE ME
THE STUPID THING!

15:48.415 --> 15:50.383
I MEAN...

15:50.417 --> 15:52.419
LET ME HELP YOU, MA'AM.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.226
YES! YES, YES, YES!
I...

15:59.259 --> 16:00.427
TIED WITH ADAM?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.262
YES! I HALF-WON!

16:02.295 --> 16:04.331
PUT ME DOWN!

16:04.364 --> 16:05.999
( class bell rings )

16:06.033 --> 16:08.068
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.
MAYBE YOU MISSED A FEW.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.003
COUNT AGAIN, PLEASE!

16:10.037 --> 16:13.073
NO, CHASE,
SHE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT
THROUGH ANOTHER COUNT.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.444
OH, I'VE GOT TO GO.
MY RIDE'S HERE.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.148
HI, BREE.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.516
LET ME GUESS:
YOU NEED A LIFT?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.585
OH, WELL, I WOULDN'T
WANT TO IMPOSE ON YOU.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.986
LET'S GO!

16:28.055 --> 16:29.389
ALL RIGHT,

16:29.422 --> 16:30.523
HOP ON.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.161
OH, BUT HOLD ON TIGHT.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.463
THIS ONE MIGHT GET
A LITTLE BUMPY.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.997
WAIT. WHAT?

16:38.031 --> 16:39.099
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

16:39.132 --> 16:41.034
AAAAHHHH!

16:41.068 --> 16:43.770
AAAAHHHH!

16:46.606 --> 16:48.275
AAH!

16:48.308 --> 16:49.609
ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.478
I THINK I SWALLOWED
A JUNE BUG!

16:51.511 --> 16:53.546
WHAT? YOU SAID
YOU WANTED A RIDE.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.349
TO MATH CLASS, NOT OHIO!

16:56.383 --> 16:59.386
I HAD TO TEACH YOU
A LESSON, LEO.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.021
YOU TOTALLY TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF MY BIONICS.

17:02.055 --> 17:05.258
AND YOU LIED TO ME
AND MY LITTLE DECIMAL POINT.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.393
I MEAN ETHAN.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.164
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.632
I GUESS I DESERVED IT.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.335
I JUST GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.537
HEH HEH HEH.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.039
WITH YOU
CARRYING ME AWAY!

17:22.040 --> 17:23.643
OH, COME ON. THAT'S FUNNY.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.779
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE TIED.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.616
NOW WE EACH HAVE TO
WRITE AN ESSAY TO
DETERMINE THE WINNER.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.518
AND WHEN EVERYONE AT
SCHOOL READS MY ESSAY,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.353
I'M GONNA BE STUDENT
OF THE SEMESTER.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.355
LET ME SEE THAT.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.757
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF
BADLY DRAWN ROCKET SHIPS.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.492
YEAH, NEXT PAGE.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.030
A TINY-HEADED GUY
WITH A BIG MOUTH?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.332
YEAH, THAT'S YOU.
NEXT PAGE.

17:48.235 --> 17:52.139
"I, ADAM DAVENPORT,
SHOULD BE STUDENT
OF THE SEMESTER."

17:52.172 --> 17:53.473
THAT'S IT?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.175
WHAT? IT'S SHARP
AND TO THE POINT.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.676
TOOK ME 25 MINUTES.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.179
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:59.212 --> 18:01.214
I'M NOT EVEN WORRIED
BECAUSE THE WINNER'S

18:01.248 --> 18:02.749
GONNA BE THE ONE WHO
CAN WRITE THE BEST ESSAY,

18:02.782 --> 18:04.584
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT'S ME.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.619
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART!

18:06.653 --> 18:10.089
WELL, YOU MAY BE
A BETTER WRITER,
BUT I'M A BETTER...!

18:10.123 --> 18:13.193
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GOT NOTHIN'.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.362
NO, I GOT THIS.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.564
( whirring sound )

18:17.597 --> 18:20.533
OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE
SO COOL BECAUSE YOU
HAVE LASERS.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.303
WELL, GUESS WHAT--
I CAN FIGHT BACK TOO!

18:25.672 --> 18:27.240
AAAHHH!

18:28.541 --> 18:30.577
BULL'S-EYE!

18:31.744 --> 18:34.347
RRAAAAHHHH!

18:34.381 --> 18:36.583
BREE, SHOULD WE
DO SOMETHING?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
NAH,
THEY'RE BIONIC BROTHERS.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.786
IT'S HOW THEY ROLL.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.688
AAAHHHH!

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
AND FLY.)

18:48.695 --> 18:51.398
HA! I CAN STILL PIN YOU
IN LESS THAN THREE SECONDS!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.401
I'M GOOD.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.739
HE ALWAYS PLAYS
THE PHYSICAL CARD.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.408
THIS CONTEST
WAS MY THING,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.243
AND HE'S TRYING
TO SHOW ME UP.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.744
HE'S NOT TRYING
TO SHOW YOU UP,

19:04.777 --> 19:07.247
HE DID SHOW YOU UP.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.882
INSTEAD OF GIVING HIM
CREDIT, YOU MADE HIM
FEEL STUPID,

19:09.916 --> 19:11.718
WHICH IS HOW YOU
ALWAYS MAKE HIM FEEL.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.624
HUH.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.659
NOW I'M STARTING TO THINK
 SHE'S SMARTER THAN YOU TOO.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.766
HEY, PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE BITTER TASTE
OF DEFEAT,

19:26.799 --> 19:28.368
WHICH I PLAN ON
SPOON-FEEDING YOU

19:28.401 --> 19:29.669
IN DELIGHTFUL,
BITE-SIZED PORTIONS

19:29.702 --> 19:31.371
EVERY SINGLE TIME
I SEE YOU.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.673
MM-HMM.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.642
LET'S JUST
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.211
AND THE STUDENT OF
 THE SEMESTER IS...

19:38.245 --> 19:39.712
ADAM DAVENPORT!

19:39.746 --> 19:41.681
WHOO-HOO! I BEAT YOU!

19:41.714 --> 19:43.450
EAT IT!
EAT THE DEFEAT!

19:43.483 --> 19:45.385
OKAY, ADAM.OUTH!

19:45.418 --> 19:46.686
LICK THE SPOON!
LICK IT!

19:46.719 --> 19:48.521
ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.226
UH, CHASE,
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT
WITH ADAM'S ESSAY.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.296
"I SHOULD BE STUDENT
OF THE SEMESTER

19:56.329 --> 19:58.331
"BECAUSE I'M TALL,
I'M HAPPY,

19:58.365 --> 20:01.268
AND I WILL LET YOU HAVE
DOGS IN THE LIBRARY."

20:01.301 --> 20:03.936
SO? WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THAT?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.473
ADAM WOULD HAVE
MISSPELLED "LIBRARY."

20:06.506 --> 20:08.508
ADAM WOULD HAVE
MISSPELLED "DOGS."

20:08.541 --> 20:10.710
OKAY, FINE.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.779
I WROTE IT,
PUT HIS NAME ON IT,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.447
AND TANKED MY OWN ESSAY.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.583
HE HAD GOOD IDEAS
AND DESERVED TO WIN.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.385
SO I GOT ONE "A-MINUS."

20:18.418 --> 20:20.820
I GUESS I CAN'T BE
PERFECT AT EVERYTHING.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.455
CHASE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.858
YOU'RE NOT PERFECT
AT A LOT OF THINGS.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.732
HEY, ADAM,

20:32.765 --> 20:36.403
CONGRATULATIONS.
THE BEST MAN WON.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.338
AND IT WAS WRONG OF ME
TO MAKE YOU FEEL

20:38.371 --> 20:39.672
LIKE YOU WEREN'T
SMART ENOUGH TO WIN.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.742
YES, IT WAS, IT WAS
VERY SCRUMPTIOUS OF YOU.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.812
"PRESUMPTUOUS."

20:45.845 --> 20:47.013
THAT AS WELL.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.950
( horn honks )

20:50.983 --> 20:52.919
HEY, BREE, GOOD NEWS!

20:52.952 --> 20:56.423
I FOUND A NEW WAY
TO MAKE IT TO CLASS ON TIME!

20:56.456 --> 20:57.757
LET'S DO IT!

20:57.790 --> 20:59.592
BUCKLE UP, GUYS!
I'M HITTING
THE AFTERBURNER

20:59.626 --> 21:00.893
ALL THE WAY TO ART CLASS!

21:00.927 --> 21:04.464
( jets roar,
tires squeal )

21:10.269 --> 21:11.638
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT UPSET

21:11.671 --> 21:13.906
ABOUT ADAM BEATING
YOU FOR STUDENT OF
THE SEMESTER?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.543
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.710
BUT I'LL GET OVER IT.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.287
( laughter )
