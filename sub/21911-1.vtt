00:20.687 --> 00:26.125
- [Woman Reading] I am
the architect of my life.

00:27.193 --> 00:30.095
I build its foundation
with the qualities

00:30.097 --> 00:32.497
of stability and resilience.

00:35.301 --> 00:38.771
Today I am overflowing
with energy and joy.

00:41.474 --> 00:45.277
My body is healthy, and
my mind is brilliant.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.647
Happiness is a choice.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.753
I base my happiness on
my own accomplishments.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.563
- Let me show you this.
- Okay.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.632
- [Woman In Blue] Do you wear
a lot of makeup, every day?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.300
- Not really.
- No?

01:08.302 --> 01:10.602
- No, we're going out
later, so I just have,

01:10.604 --> 01:12.571
if I do it early, then I
don't have to bother later on.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.406
- [Woman In Blue] What
are you doing later?

01:14.408 --> 01:18.477
- Nice, you and your husband?
- Yes, and another couple.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.079
- [Woman In Blue] Are
you out of eye liner?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.280
Do you still have some?

01:21.282 --> 01:23.215
- I really don't
wear much eye liner.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.484
- You know what you can do
with an eye liner, too though,

01:25.486 --> 01:27.686
if you want to soften
it up a little bit,

01:27.688 --> 01:30.122
you can add a little bit
of eye shadow on top.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.223
- Top, right.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.524
- [Woman In Blue]
I have a dog, too.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.126
What's his name?

01:34.128 --> 01:37.596
- I call him Jojo.
- Jojo, that's cute.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.231
Does he wear makeup?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.432
- [Woman Customer]
Most of the time,

01:40.434 --> 01:42.568
do you just go from
house to house?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.536
- I do, yes.
- Wow.

01:44.538 --> 01:48.140
- [Woman Customer] And
are people receptive?

01:48.142 --> 01:51.777
- Some, some people don't
want anything to do with me.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.512
- [Woman Customer] I really
didn't want to let you in,

01:53.514 --> 01:54.680
but I'm happy I did, now.

01:54.682 --> 01:59.284
Once I'm in here, you're
discovering beautiful products

01:59.286 --> 02:02.321
that you would have
never had access to.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.555
What does your husband do?

02:03.557 --> 02:06.225
They build gas stations,
they maintain...

02:06.227 --> 02:08.426
- Gas stations?
- Gas stations, yeah.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.162
- [Woman In Blue] Oh wow,
I've never heard of anyone

02:10.163 --> 02:13.665
- Me either, until I met him.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.634
- I usually take the shadows
and I apply it to the face

02:15.636 --> 02:17.269
in a line, and that pretty much,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.204
that's like really going
all the way for me.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.806
- That's a natural
look, that's fine.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.541
- Yeah.
- It looks beautiful on you.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.742
I see that's what you did today,

02:23.744 --> 02:24.576
and it really looks beautiful.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.611
- Oh, thanks.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.348
- Exactly, I was gonna
tell you about those.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.918
So yes, we have cocktail
parties that we can do,

02:32.920 --> 02:36.522
either at your place of
work or here, but I mean,

02:36.524 --> 02:39.258
this house is meant for parties.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.659
Oh, who is that?

02:46.566 --> 02:48.634
- [Woman Customer]
Say hi to Sherry.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.636
- [Sherry] Hi, Howie.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.422
Hey, you.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.894
Oh, hey, hold on.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.197
I have something for you.

03:33.446 --> 03:34.680
You want this?

03:37.817 --> 03:39.418
Slow down, Jojo.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.703
- [Man On TV] This is a hold up.

03:57.705 --> 04:01.707
Put your hands behind your
head and keep 'em there.

04:01.709 --> 04:05.377
(indistinct talking on TV)

04:14.687 --> 04:17.389
(movie music)

04:18.625 --> 04:20.826
- [Woman On TV] You
don't seem very sorry.

04:20.827 --> 04:24.863
- [Second Woman On TV] I
am, I'm sorry I was caught.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.944
(rock music)

05:06.973 --> 05:08.807
- [Sherry] Oh, fuck.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.641
- What?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.543
- I don't have my key.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.579
I don't have my keys.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.414
- Fuck, are you serious?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.416
- No.

05:17.717 --> 05:18.817
Oh, shit.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.019
What are we gonna do?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.788
You wanna go in the car?

05:22.790 --> 05:23.722
- [Man] No, I don't.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.024
I don't want to fuck in my car.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.026
Oh, hey.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.461
Here.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.930
- [Sherry] Oh, you're a genius.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.901
- Here, can you do it?

05:36.936 --> 05:39.604
Here, I'll just...
- All right.

05:40.807 --> 05:41.973
Ow, oh god.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.630
(doorbell rings)

06:33.693 --> 06:35.594
- Focus on what you do best.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.862
(truck honks)

06:36.864 --> 06:38.597
We know you could
go on for hours

06:38.599 --> 06:40.899
about how great
your business is,

06:40.901 --> 06:42.634
and we don't blame you.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.169
You're amazing.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.773
But since you need to
keep it short and sweet...

06:47.775 --> 06:50.675
So this red, you
know the classic.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.881
Yeah, this pink, too, is lovely.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.883
I think you purchased this
one last time, didn't you?

06:57.885 --> 06:58.917
- [Brunette Customer] Did I?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.819
- To you, too. Cheers.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.592
Yum, I love this.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.962
(indistinct conversation)

07:12.598 --> 07:14.466
No, love this, it's not bad.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.536
[Brunette Customer]
Take another one.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.737
So I hope you don't mind,

07:18.739 --> 07:19.971
but what was your
home life, growing up?

07:19.973 --> 07:23.141
I mean, was it good for
you? Do you have any...

07:23.143 --> 07:24.876
- We had a lot of
dysfunction, so you can see...

07:24.878 --> 07:26.845
- A lot of dysfunction, so I'd
ask you, if you don't mind.

07:26.847 --> 07:30.982
- Well, my mother passed
away when I was very young.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.451
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.652
- It's okay. Yeah.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.719
- How young?

07:36.556 --> 07:37.789
- She was 40.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.992
Yeah, pretty young right?
- Sure.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.594
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.563
Do you mind if I ask from what?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.498
- She was sick,
yeah, she was sick.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.836
She had cancer, but, you
know, my father raised us,

07:50.838 --> 07:54.506
and he was, er, he was
wonderful and, yeah.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.811
But, er, yeah. My sister took
very good care of me, too.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.216
- Much older?
- Yeah, she's older than me.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.998
(indistinct talking on TV)

08:54.700 --> 08:56.935
- Mm, I like your jacket.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.537
- I've had this for a long time.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.939
- That's nice. It suits you.

09:05.144 --> 09:08.079
So what kind of work do you do?

09:08.081 --> 09:11.950
- I operate my own
sporting goods store.

09:11.952 --> 09:17.088
- It's the number one store
in sporting good supplies,

09:17.090 --> 09:21.793
- Oh, you must be
very successful, then.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.997
- [Blond Woman] How are
you two doing tonight?

09:25.999 --> 09:28.733
- We're fine, we're fine.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.102
- You are such a handsome man.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.273
I mean, look at him.
(laughing)

09:35.275 --> 09:36.975
- What's your name?

09:36.977 --> 09:40.078
- Oh, well, it doesn't
really matter, does it?

09:40.080 --> 09:45.951
I'm gonna tell you that
some people call me Trish.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.920
- Do you want anything else?

09:48.922 --> 09:49.788
- I should be going.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.989
It's past my bedtime.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.991
- [Trish] Oh.
(giggling)

09:52.993 --> 09:55.026
You're funny on top
of everything else.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.796
- I'll walk you to your car.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.830
- Pleasure to meet you, Trish.

09:58.832 --> 09:59.832
- Likewise.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.696
- Hey, come in.

10:33.099 --> 10:36.101
You want a beer?
- I'll take one.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.169
- Make yourself at home.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.074
- How long have you lived here?

10:43.076 --> 10:46.144
- I don't know, on
and off, I guess.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.886
- You're so nice.

10:56.689 --> 10:57.756
- Thank you.

11:07.933 --> 11:11.903
- I don't often do
this sort of thing.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.238
- You don't enjoy kissing?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.273
- No, I like kissing.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.149
What's that over there?

11:25.251 --> 11:27.752
- Oh, I sell makeup products.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.723
- How long have you
been doing that?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.358
- A couple years now.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.797
I like the personal
interactions.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.302
How did you get
your store going?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.304
- We, er,

11:48.207 --> 11:50.742
bought an empty space

11:50.744 --> 11:53.178
with the money we saved and,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.413
we got a small business loan.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.848
- [Sherry] Oh.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.252
- We're looking to
open up another store.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.459
Go home with a woman I just met,

12:09.228 --> 12:11.162
especially at a bar.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.332
- When do you go home with them?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.334
- I don't.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.737
- So I'm unique.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.920
- I, I need to go
to the bathroom.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.455
- Okay, it's right...

13:18.164 --> 13:20.899
(water running)

13:22.334 --> 13:24.035
Is everything all
right in there?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.304
- I'll be out in a minute.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.140
(toilet flushes)

13:34.413 --> 13:37.015
I don't think I can do this.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.584
I have a girlfriend.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.353
- Oh, we don't have to fuck.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.989
We can just kiss and get naked.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.292
And I can blow you.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.527
- I need to go, I'm sorry.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.930
- We don't have to do anything.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.599
We can just watch television.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.867
- I'm sorry.

14:00.372 --> 14:03.341
- Well, you're not
much fun, are you?

14:32.238 --> 14:35.106
(movie music)

14:35.108 --> 14:37.542
- Share it for old time's sake.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.254
Goodbye, my love.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.299
(alarm buzzing)

15:11.677 --> 15:15.446
- [Sherry Reading] Think
success early in the morning.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.916
Begin with the end in mind.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.553
When you dress
yourself for success,

15:22.555 --> 15:25.189
whether you want your
achievements to be

15:25.191 --> 15:28.426
in career, love, marriage,
or your rightful position

15:28.428 --> 15:31.429
in society, then
you've already taken

15:31.431 --> 15:34.098
the first step up the ladder.

15:53.385 --> 15:56.421
(doorbell rings)

16:08.133 --> 16:09.233
- Hello.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.301
- Peter, hi.

16:13.505 --> 16:17.008
You're much bigger
than I remember.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.443
Oh, maybe you don't remember me.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.278
I'm Sherry, I'm Abbie's sister.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.379
- I remember you.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.647
Abbie's in the kitchen.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.483
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:31.457 --> 16:32.623
- Hi Abbie.

16:33.425 --> 16:34.359
- Hey.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.760
- Hey, look at all this food.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.462
It looks amazing.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.466
- You look great.
- Thank you.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.101
- [Abbie] You're early.

16:43.103 --> 16:47.105
- Yeah, I had a couple of
appointments that fell through.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.075
I thought you wouldn't
mind if I came early.

16:51.077 --> 16:54.545
- It's no problem at
all, just, unexpected.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.750
I would've made some snacks.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.619
- I don't need snacks,
I'm fine. That's fine.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.621
- Great.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.060
- Can I do anything to
help you? Chop stuff?

17:09.061 --> 17:11.596
- No, I can't think of anything.

17:16.234 --> 17:20.104
You know, yes, there's a
concentrated juice pack

17:20.106 --> 17:23.307
in the freezer, if you want
to mix it with some water.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.542
- I'm really good at that.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.759
So how have you been?

17:41.761 --> 17:45.296
- Oh, you know. I'm
still at the Post Office.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.433
I was promoted to
regional manager.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.803
- Regional manager?
Abbie, that's amazing.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.674
- Haven't seen you
in a while, Sherry.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.676
- Liz.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.111
Oh, how are you?

18:01.313 --> 18:03.714
- I'm fine, thank
you. How are you?

18:03.716 --> 18:04.849
- Good, good.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.552
- Taste that.
- Okay.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.291
More salt and cream.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.725
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.694
- Peter is handsome.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.264
He grew up nicely.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.769
How long has he
been living here?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.205
- He moved in a few months ago.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.207
- I thought I told you.

18:29.808 --> 18:33.244
- It must have slipped my mind.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.581
- [Liz] Do you want
anything to drink?

18:36.583 --> 18:40.384
- A glass of water would
be, yeah, thank you.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.358
Thank you.
- Give me your jacket.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.292
- Oh no, you don't
have to do that.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.660
- It's no problem.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.696
- Okay.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.435
- I'll put your jacket and
purse in the hallway closet.

18:57.437 --> 19:02.707
- Dinner is gonna be
ready in about 20 minutes.

19:08.814 --> 19:13.251
- If you want to see Alice,
she's up in her bedroom.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.787
(soft music)

19:47.553 --> 19:49.387
- What are you doing?

19:51.690 --> 19:54.759
- I'm, er, reading
a book for class.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.199
- I got you these gifts.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.604
Don't I get a hug?

20:10.776 --> 20:13.444
I'm sorry, it's been a while.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.724
Your room looks really nice.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.660
- We painted it a month ago.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.628
- Who's we?

20:30.630 --> 20:31.696
- Liz and I.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.603
- I like this shade of blue.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.738
It makes me feel at ease.

20:42.274 --> 20:43.674
- We almost went with pink,

20:43.676 --> 20:47.545
but it seemed too
stereotypical for my age.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.814
- I had a pink room
when I was your age.

20:49.816 --> 20:53.551
- That's what I was
trying to avoid, cliche.

21:00.826 --> 21:04.695
- So what types of
classes are you taking?

21:04.697 --> 21:06.430
- I'm in pre-Algebra

21:07.532 --> 21:10.268
and American History
and Literature.

21:11.870 --> 21:16.574
- I could never remember
dates and order of events.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.410
- I enjoy history.
I like to read.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.947
- I thought you were better
at math for some reason.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.782
- I like math, too.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.886
Do you like to play games?

21:29.688 --> 21:31.355
- What kinda games?

21:32.457 --> 21:35.860
- Card games, board
games, computer games.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.895
- I like card games, yeah.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.771
- Let's play poker.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.005
- You know how to play poker?

21:48.007 --> 21:49.874
- Liz taught me.

21:49.876 --> 21:53.044
- Well, I haven't
played in ages, so.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.716
- You can start.

22:01.019 --> 22:04.322
- So are you seeing any boys?

22:04.324 --> 22:05.723
- You're wondering
if I'm dating anyone?

22:05.725 --> 22:08.859
- Yeah, do you go
on dates with boys?

22:10.395 --> 22:13.030
- Abbie says I can't
start dating until I'm 16.

22:13.032 --> 22:16.000
How many cards do you want?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.002
- I'll have

22:18.036 --> 22:19.036
three.

22:29.815 --> 22:33.918
- I know it's been a
while since I've seen you,

22:33.920 --> 22:37.121
but I'll call you mom
if you want me to.

22:44.429 --> 22:48.866
- We don't have to discuss
these formalities right now.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.737
Maybe we could just
play cards for a while.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.842
- Are you staying for dinner?

22:57.844 --> 22:59.777
- Do you want me to?

23:00.879 --> 23:03.481
- [Alice] I would like that.

23:04.516 --> 23:05.583
- I'll stay.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.122
- We forgot to bet.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.124
- Oh.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.625
That's all right.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.594
- What do you have?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.996
- I have three eights, a seven,

23:18.998 --> 23:20.598
and this guy, what's his name?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.899
- Jack.
- Yeah, him.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.867
I have him, what do you have?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.735
- Don't look.
- Show me.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.903
Show me.
- I have a straight.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.004
- Aw!

23:27.006 --> 23:28.006
Damn it.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.141
You're good.

23:31.476 --> 23:32.910
- Dinner's ready.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.979
- I'll go wash my hands.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.719
Can we start eating?
- No.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.721
Not until we say grace.

23:44.890 --> 23:45.956
Okay, hands.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.930
Bless us, oh Lord,
for these, thy gifts

23:52.932 --> 23:54.432
which we are about to receive.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.834
In Christ's name we pray. Amen

23:56.836 --> 23:58.202
- [Everyone] Amen.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.009
- There you go.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.011
- Thank you.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.051
- Aren't you eating?

24:14.053 --> 24:15.719
- I'll eat.

24:15.721 --> 24:19.490
I was just waiting for
everyone to be served.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.093
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.098
(crickets chirping)

24:36.208 --> 24:39.176
We enjoyed having you over.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.012
- [Sherry] I'd like
to come by more often.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.249
- I know Alice would like that.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.617
- If it's possible,

24:46.619 --> 24:50.254
I'd like to be a larger
part of her life.

24:50.256 --> 24:53.157
- [Abbie] You've
said this before.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.192
- I mean it.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.798
- Have you been going to AA?

25:03.802 --> 25:07.037
If you do want to
be part of her life,

25:07.906 --> 25:10.040
you have to start
making a contribution,

25:10.042 --> 25:12.543
really being there for her.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.081
And you need to start
putting down roots.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.283
When was the last
time I saw you?

25:19.285 --> 25:20.951
When? A year ago?

25:22.888 --> 25:23.787
And,

25:23.789 --> 25:28.659
I don't even know where
you're living anymore.

25:29.995 --> 25:31.862
Are you even listening to me?

25:31.864 --> 25:36.100
- Yeah, I'm listening, I just
have something in my eye.

25:37.636 --> 25:39.036
I think I got it.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.171
I'm listening. I'm sorry.

25:42.607 --> 25:46.644
- I need you to start
helping out with money.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.946
It's hard on Liz
and me financially.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.916
Peter's going away
to college soon.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.286
And it's not fair,

25:57.122 --> 25:58.222
to me or Alice.

26:14.339 --> 26:15.873
- [Sherry] Hey.

26:20.779 --> 26:21.979
- Hey. Here you go.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.048
- [Sherry] I'm starving.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.617
- You haven't changed.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.186
- No, I haven't been home yet.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.123
When do you get off?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.359
- In an hour, but it's
pretty dead today.

26:35.361 --> 26:36.860
- So stay a minute.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.296
- I can stay a little while.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.365
What do you think of the burger?

26:41.367 --> 26:44.001
- It's a little
dry, but it's fine.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.136
- Yeah, french fries
are soggy here, too.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.005
- Maybe you should
get a new cook.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.075
- A good cook is hard to find.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.711
Do you see that guy, over
there, walking to his car?

26:53.713 --> 26:55.646
Do you remember him?

26:55.648 --> 26:58.048
He was our 11th grade
chemistry teacher.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.050
- Mm.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.652
Mr. Williams.

27:01.654 --> 27:02.886
- I just find it so weird

27:02.888 --> 27:05.656
to see a teacher outside
the context of school.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.225
Like, they don't belong
in the real world.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.128
There's school and then
there's normal life.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.396
- Well, we're not
in school anymore.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.765
- I know, I just
find it kinda sad.

27:14.767 --> 27:18.736
They're normal people, just
like us, but no purpose.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.872
- I'm sure Mr.
Williams has a purpose.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.341
He probably has a
family of some sort.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.977
- Comes in here
quite often alone.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.214
But it didn't seem like a
wife or date or anything.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.082
More like a sister.

27:33.284 --> 27:36.053
- Well, maybe he has
a hobby or something,

27:36.055 --> 27:38.288
like fishing or sailing or

27:39.157 --> 27:41.091
something middle-aged people do.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.227
- I hope that
doesn't happen to us.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.061
- It won't.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.063
- Yeah? How do you know?

27:46.065 --> 27:47.898
- Well,

27:47.900 --> 27:50.200
I was thinking the other day,

27:51.670 --> 27:54.204
we could open up our own salon.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.073
Maybe make a little money.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.308
- What are you talking about?

27:58.310 --> 28:02.146
- I just thought we could do
something more substantial.

28:02.148 --> 28:05.983
You could do hair, manage
the place, potentially.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.985
- A beauty salon.
- Yeah.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.788
It would be a beauty salon.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.157
- You done with this?
- Mm-hmm.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.361
- I like the idea, but where
would we get the money?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.163
I don't have enough clients
to support a business yet,

28:19.165 --> 28:23.233
and you're not the
most reliable person.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.835
- That's not true.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.136
I'm getting better.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.206
I'm going to my meetings more.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.910
I'm trying to bring
Alice back into my life.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.145
We'll figure it
out as we go along.

28:35.147 --> 28:38.248
- This isn't just some
crazy fantasy of yours?

28:38.250 --> 28:41.118
- This is the real thing.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.054
I'm thinking more and more
about my future these days.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.089
- Yeah? How's that?

28:45.091 --> 28:46.824
- I'm thinking about

28:47.959 --> 28:50.227
my actions and opportunities.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.263
I'm laying the groundwork
to prepare myself

28:53.265 --> 28:54.865
for success and happiness...

28:54.867 --> 28:57.134
- That is nonsense.
- I'm serious.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.402
Very serious.
- All right.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.238
Well, I'll believe
it when I see it.

29:34.205 --> 29:36.807
- Um, nice seeing you again.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.945
Good, I've been going
here for four years now,

29:41.947 --> 29:43.447
and, um, it helps, you know.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.115
- Yeah.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.284
- [Man] So, you're really
welcome. Let me know.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.485
- Cool.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.420
- [Man] All right.
I'll see you in there?

29:50.422 --> 29:51.321
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.990
- Be right there.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.293
- Okay. Good seeing you.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.096
All right, see you soon.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.898
- See ya.
- All right.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.355
(wretching)

30:31.062 --> 30:32.930
- Want some help?

30:32.932 --> 30:34.531
- [Trish] No, I'll be fine.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.999
Just mind your own business.

30:36.001 --> 30:39.403
- I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to do a decent thing here

30:39.405 --> 30:40.470
and help you out.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.440
- Oh my god, just fuck off.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.543
(wretching)

30:46.545 --> 30:49.346
(toilet flushes)

30:53.418 --> 30:55.285
- [Bartender] Do
you want anything?

30:55.287 --> 30:59.156
- I'll have a whiskey
on the rocks, please.

31:16.407 --> 31:17.407
Are you alone?

31:24.115 --> 31:25.949
Are you a little shy?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.656
What are you drinking?

31:41.065 --> 31:44.201
You know, you didn't
have to do that.

32:04.188 --> 32:06.256
- [Man] Unlock the door?

32:13.498 --> 32:15.499
- Hey, what do you want from me?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.501
Get off me.

32:36.087 --> 32:39.056
- You shouldn't smoke in here.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.558
I don't want you
to get kicked out.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.227
- I can read. I see the sign.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.571
If you're so worried.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.477
Ow.
(laughing)

33:06.384 --> 33:09.987
Now we have nothing
to worry about, see?

33:14.058 --> 33:16.193
Can I ask you a question?

33:17.462 --> 33:21.264
Who were you waiting
for, at the bar earlier?

33:23.701 --> 33:24.701
- My wife.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.172
I'm separated.

33:31.476 --> 33:34.478
- How long have
you been separated?

33:35.313 --> 33:36.480
- Six months.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.650
I guess some things
aren't meant to be.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.055
- I saw a movie on TV recently.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.290
It's called Starting Over,

33:48.359 --> 33:51.061
with that girl
from Murphy Brown.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.663
- Candace Bergen?
- Yeah.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.766
Candace Bergen.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.501
She's not the lead
in it, though.

33:57.503 --> 34:00.570
It mainly centers
around Burt Reynolds.

34:00.572 --> 34:04.541
And he leaves his wife 'cause
she's been cheating on him,

34:04.543 --> 34:08.578
and he moves from New York to
Boston to start a new life.

34:09.580 --> 34:12.616
And he meets this girl there.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.551
She may not be as pretty
as Candace Bergen,

34:14.553 --> 34:15.652
but she's

34:17.487 --> 34:19.656
she's reliable and sweet.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.693
- Is there a lesson
in this for me?

34:24.762 --> 34:26.163
- I thought you'd
like to see the movie.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.433
You might find something
relatable in it.

34:29.435 --> 34:33.837
Like what life is like
for adults after marriage.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.806
It's pretty funny, too.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.641
I'm gonna go to bed.

35:04.135 --> 35:06.303
Am I gonna see you again?

35:07.472 --> 35:10.774
- I left my number on the table.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.309
Give me a call.

35:14.378 --> 35:15.378
- Goodbye.

35:16.581 --> 35:17.647
- Goodbye.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.900
- [Sherry Reading]
There must be something

35:36.902 --> 35:40.804
that you want in life
more than anything else.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.774
As a door-to-door
makeup saleswoman,

35:44.776 --> 35:48.545
I will not settle for
less than I deserve.

35:49.547 --> 35:52.649
I will continue to seek myself.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.651
My place is at the top.

36:09.267 --> 36:10.267
Hello?

36:16.474 --> 36:17.774
Is anyone in here?

36:36.527 --> 36:38.562
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.197
- [Woman] Were you
interested in the space?

36:40.199 --> 36:42.365
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to just barge in.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.767
- No, that's quite all right.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.735
You just missed the owner.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.204
I'm leaving in
just a few minutes,

36:47.206 --> 36:48.405
but if you have any questions,

36:48.407 --> 36:49.940
I'd be happy to
answer them for you.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.342
- That would be lovely.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.611
Well, obviously it needs a
little bit of paint, but...

36:54.613 --> 36:58.582
- Yeah, it needs some work,
but then, don't we all?

36:58.584 --> 37:01.251
I think it has great potential.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.953
- The carpet, also,
is a little much.

37:02.955 --> 37:05.522
But you can remove
that easily, right?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.824
- [Woman] Carpet is always
replaceable, absolutely.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.260
- I think it might be perfect
for what I'm looking for,

37:10.262 --> 37:12.362
- What kind of
business are you in,

37:12.364 --> 37:12.996
if you don't mind my asking?

37:12.998 --> 37:14.431
- It's a beauty salon.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.865
- Oh, well there you go.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.535
I think this would be
perfect for a salon.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.703
- I'm a makeup artist.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.938
- Are you, really?
Well, that's wonderful.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.873
Listen, if you're
serious about...

37:23.875 --> 37:25.775
- I am serious.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.278
- [Woman] Give me a call.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.413
- Susan, I will
call you tomorrow.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.748
- Very good, and
what's your name?

37:31.750 --> 37:34.484
- [Susan] Sherry Graham, very
nice to meet you, Sherry.

37:34.486 --> 37:37.454
- You too, Susan,
nice to meet you.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.559
- [Recording] You've
reached Abbie and Liz.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.761
Please leave a detailed
message after the beep.

37:44.763 --> 37:45.729
(beeping)

37:45.731 --> 37:50.533
So I thought a lot
about what you said,

37:50.535 --> 37:55.538
about money and contributing
financially to Alice's life.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.906
And I have a plan.

37:58.509 --> 38:00.510
I didn't have a
chance to tell you.

38:00.512 --> 38:03.413
I'm going to open
up my own salon.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.782
I have an appointment
already scheduled

38:05.784 --> 38:07.951
with a bank loan manager.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.286
So everything will be fine.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.620
I'll let you know how it goes.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.788
Wish me luck.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.758
Lay the groundwork.

38:18.529 --> 38:20.930
Prepare yourself for success

38:21.999 --> 38:23.433
and happiness.

38:27.438 --> 38:29.339
Success and happiness.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.759
- Hello, hi there, Alan Gilmore.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.561
- [Sherry] It's so nice
to meet you, Mr. Gilmore.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.729
- A pleasure to
meet you, as well.

38:52.731 --> 38:53.863
Please, take a seat.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.998
- Thank you for seeing me today.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.833
- Sure, absolutely.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.436
- You have a lovely office.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.971
(laughing)

39:01.973 --> 39:03.039
- Thank you.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.842
The branch I just
transferred in from

39:05.844 --> 39:09.346
was a nicer office, but
that's very kind of you.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.781
- And that, did you make that?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.817
- No, no, it was here.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.785
Everything was
here, when I came.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.888
Anyway, can I get you
a bottle of water?

39:18.890 --> 39:20.490
- If it's not too much trouble.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.424
- No, not at all.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.926
You want sparkling or still?

39:22.928 --> 39:23.928
- Still.

39:28.699 --> 39:29.833
- All right.
- Thank you.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.768
- There you are.

39:31.770 --> 39:35.372
So how can I, er, how
can I help you today?

39:35.374 --> 39:38.908
- I am inquiring
about a business loan.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.910
- Okay, what kind of business?

39:40.912 --> 39:43.613
- Well, my friend
and I, we have this

39:43.615 --> 39:46.916
idea to open up our own
salon, a beauty salon.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.854
- That sounds good. Do
you have a business plan?

39:50.856 --> 39:53.656
- I'm still working on that one.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.859
It's coming along, though.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.795
- [Alan] Okay, so today you
don't have the business plan.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.964
Did you bring a bank statement?

40:00.966 --> 40:02.432
Do you have any of the paperwork

40:02.434 --> 40:03.566
that you needed to fill out?

40:03.568 --> 40:04.834
- Mm-hmm.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.936
I have the forms here,

40:12.143 --> 40:13.977
filled out.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.111
- All right.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.480
This is a bank statement.

40:21.719 --> 40:22.986
Oh, it's just, it's just this?

40:22.988 --> 40:25.121
- Yeah, it's all there.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.123
- Oh.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.127
(sighs)

40:31.129 --> 40:34.931
- This is your overall
income from last year?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.469
- Yeah, well,

40:40.771 --> 40:41.771
it was, um,

40:42.973 --> 40:44.073
it was um,

40:45.910 --> 40:47.644
a tough year for me.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.778
- You can't,

40:48.780 --> 40:51.548
you can't smoke in here.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.016
- Oh, I'm sorry.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.851
- That's fine.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.987
- It's the rules.
- Yeah, I just didn't know.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.890
- That's okay.
- There was a rule.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.629
- Well, I, I'm not sure what's,

41:07.765 --> 41:10.834
how the bank can be
of service to you.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.102
- Well, you've
barely heard me out.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.871
It's a really good idea.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.039
- [Alan] Well, it might
be a very good idea,

41:16.041 --> 41:17.974
but you don't have
a business plan,

41:17.976 --> 41:22.712
and the numbers here
don't qualify for a loan.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.882
I'm not sure what
you were expecting.

41:25.884 --> 41:29.619
The bank has guidelines and
requirements for business loans.

41:29.621 --> 41:33.256
There's a pamphlet you
should take a look at.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.726
- I'm just getting started,

41:36.728 --> 41:37.728
and,

41:39.096 --> 41:41.598
you don't even know how
much I'm asking for.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.699
- Well, I'm sorry, ma'am...

41:42.701 --> 41:44.934
- I'm asking for $250,000.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.905
- Okay, if you're serious
about a loan of that size,

41:48.907 --> 41:50.974
you need to come prepared.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.909
- [Sherry] I'm serious.

41:52.911 --> 41:57.213
- Okay, so if you're serious
about a loan of that size,

41:57.215 --> 42:00.717
you need to provide the
bank with fiscal statements

42:00.719 --> 42:03.953
and other documentation
in order to get a loan.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.757
I'm, I'm sorry that you had
some sort of misunderstanding

42:07.759 --> 42:11.828
about this meeting, but,
it's not going to work.

42:13.998 --> 42:16.566
- [Sherry Reading] Don't get
lost in reckless emotions

42:16.568 --> 42:18.234
during moments of trial.

42:18.236 --> 42:22.772
Learn to lift yourself up
and harness positive energy.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.942
Go to work with a
smile on your face.

42:42.693 --> 42:44.227
- [Sherry] I was wondering
if I could introduce you

42:44.229 --> 42:45.862
to our beauty line.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.965
It would only take two
minutes of your time today.

42:48.967 --> 42:51.334
- Well, it's really
not a great time.

42:51.336 --> 42:54.003
I'm under construction. I'm...

42:54.005 --> 42:56.172
- [Sherry] You're
under construction?

42:56.174 --> 42:58.207
Renovations? Oh, wow.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.644
And we have a
beautiful line here

43:01.646 --> 43:03.980
that I would love
to introduce you to.

43:03.982 --> 43:06.683
And we have wonderful
specials this season, as well.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.851
If you have two minutes...

43:34.244 --> 43:35.244
Oh, fuck.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.687
(sighs)

43:53.163 --> 43:55.298
Because you can read about
these tips in magazines,

43:55.300 --> 43:58.201
but they're never right
for everyone, right?

43:58.203 --> 44:02.238
That's what's great about
having a consultant come to you.

44:04.975 --> 44:05.975
Perfect.

44:07.945 --> 44:09.145
Let me show you.

44:10.714 --> 44:12.682
So, I've only done
the right side,

44:12.684 --> 44:14.283
so you can see the difference.

44:14.285 --> 44:15.952
- [Woman] Mm-hmm.

44:17.054 --> 44:18.955
- So your skin is just
a little more matte.

44:18.957 --> 44:21.090
- Mm-hmm.
- Perfect.

44:21.092 --> 44:23.926
So should we start off
with that, those three?

44:23.928 --> 44:26.062
- Well, what, how
much does it cost?

44:26.064 --> 44:27.230
How much is each?

44:27.232 --> 44:29.365
- This foundation is $15.

44:30.434 --> 44:32.402
The nail polish is $12.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.271
And the lipstick is 20.

44:35.273 --> 44:36.273
- Oh.

44:37.274 --> 44:39.742
Maybe I'll just take
the catalog and...

44:39.744 --> 44:41.778
- Okay. All right.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.713
I still want to leave you
those samples, though.

44:43.715 --> 44:47.083
- Okay, well thank you.
- All right?

44:47.085 --> 44:48.751
How about the lipstick?

44:48.753 --> 44:50.820
If I, usually it's 15.

44:50.822 --> 44:54.824
I said 20 right now,
I'm sorry, it's 20.

44:54.826 --> 44:57.093
Since it's your
very first lipstick,

44:57.095 --> 44:59.829
I could let it go for $15.

44:59.831 --> 45:00.463
What do you think?

45:00.465 --> 45:02.165
- [Woman] Um...

45:02.167 --> 45:04.467
- It does look beautiful on you.

45:04.469 --> 45:06.269
- Thank you, but um...

45:08.005 --> 45:09.439
- You want to think about it.

45:09.441 --> 45:12.041
I can sense it, that's okay.

45:34.498 --> 45:37.400
- Uh, four letters,
Blair or Danza.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.468
- Tony.
- Tony, yeah.

45:38.470 --> 45:39.470
- Tony.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.205
Blank Maria, three letters.

45:42.207 --> 45:45.041
- Oh, well the
chicken looks done.

45:45.043 --> 45:46.275
- Ooh.

45:46.277 --> 45:47.810
- Ted, will you get
ready for dinner?

45:47.812 --> 45:48.878
- [Ted] Yes.

45:54.051 --> 45:55.051
- Hey, hey.

45:55.053 --> 46:00.156
We are talking about turning
the office into a bedroom,

46:00.158 --> 46:03.326
and I want you to
think about moving in.

46:03.328 --> 46:04.227
- Uh,

46:04.229 --> 46:08.264
I just, I've had trouble moving
in with friends in the past.

46:08.266 --> 46:10.133
- Come on, is there
anything bad about you

46:10.135 --> 46:12.235
I don't already know?

46:12.237 --> 46:13.269
And it would be so
much better for you

46:13.271 --> 46:15.271
than that shit motel.

46:17.274 --> 46:19.308
- I will reflect upon the offer.

46:19.310 --> 46:20.877
Thank you so much.

46:22.112 --> 46:24.447
- [Ted] We need
more toilet paper.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.983
- [Blond Woman] Okay, watch
out, hot, coming through.

46:26.985 --> 46:29.385
- Ooh, that looks delicious.

46:30.354 --> 46:31.354
Beer?

46:32.122 --> 46:33.422
- [Sherry] Yes.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.492
(phone ringing)

46:36.494 --> 46:38.361
- [Ted] That's you.

46:42.432 --> 46:43.432
- Hello?

46:45.302 --> 46:48.471
Oh hi, I didn't
recognize the number.

46:51.475 --> 46:55.912
I'm having dinner now, but
I could meet you in an hour.

46:59.016 --> 47:02.552
Okay, yeah I'll meet
you there around 10:00.

47:04.488 --> 47:05.488
Bye.

47:09.293 --> 47:11.327
- Who was that?

47:11.329 --> 47:12.528
- [Sherry] A new friend.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.030
- Oh?
- Ooh.

47:14.032 --> 47:15.998
- Will you be staying?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.367
- Well, maybe I'll
grab something quickly

47:18.369 --> 47:20.203
and go join him, if that's okay?

47:20.205 --> 47:22.205
- Yeah, yeah of course.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.441
- [Sherry] Can I borrow a shirt?

47:25.443 --> 47:29.879
- Yes, go in my room.
There's some in the dresser.

48:35.412 --> 48:39.448
(tapping)
(gasps)

48:41.151 --> 48:42.685
- [Sherry] You scared
the shit outta me.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.287
- Didn't you hear me pull up?

48:44.289 --> 48:45.421
- [Sherry] No, I
didn't see anybody.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.390
- I parked right there.

48:49.459 --> 48:50.660
Should I get in?

48:51.962 --> 48:53.663
- [Sherry] I thought we
were going somewhere.

48:53.665 --> 48:55.097
- In a minute.

49:08.412 --> 49:10.546
Aren't you gonna join me?

49:17.688 --> 49:19.288
- [Sherry] Shit.

49:22.192 --> 49:23.192
Ow, ow.

49:33.070 --> 49:35.204
I feel like I'm in high school.

49:35.206 --> 49:37.273
- [Man] That's not good.

49:38.408 --> 49:41.377
- We could just go to my place.

49:41.379 --> 49:45.114
- [Man] This is
better, trust me.

49:45.116 --> 49:46.182
Come closer.

50:00.731 --> 50:02.598
You have soft lips.

50:08.739 --> 50:09.705
You okay?

50:09.707 --> 50:11.507
- Yeah. This is nice.

50:16.580 --> 50:19.615
I have a funny
feeling about you.

50:23.186 --> 50:24.587
- [Man] We don't
have to have sex.

50:24.589 --> 50:25.488
- I know.

50:25.490 --> 50:30.659
I know, well, I'm very
much open to having sex.

50:38.135 --> 50:40.503
Tell me something
about yourself.

50:40.505 --> 50:41.670
- [Man] What?

50:44.541 --> 50:45.708
- Where were you born?

50:45.710 --> 50:47.143
- I was born in Los Angeles.

50:47.145 --> 50:50.112
I came out here to,
er, go to college.

50:52.382 --> 50:54.216
- What did you study?

50:54.218 --> 50:55.451
- [Man] Music.

50:56.753 --> 50:58.687
- Do you play any?

50:58.689 --> 51:02.291
- [Man] I used to
play guitar and piano.

51:03.593 --> 51:05.694
- And why don't
you play anymore?

51:05.696 --> 51:07.063
- [Man] That's a
lot of questions.

51:07.065 --> 51:08.130
- I'm sorry.

51:08.765 --> 51:10.433
I'm just curious.

51:18.475 --> 51:21.477
- [Man] I learned
quickly that, um,

51:22.679 --> 51:26.582
being a musician was not
economically feasible.

51:29.219 --> 51:32.388
So what did you end
up doing instead?

51:34.491 --> 51:35.624
- [Man] I went back to school.

51:35.626 --> 51:38.094
I got a degree in engineering.

51:41.631 --> 51:44.733
- How long did
your marriage last?

51:46.136 --> 51:47.269
- Five years.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.808
- Did you have any kids?

51:52.810 --> 51:54.643
- [Man] No, we tried.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.481
- Well, what happened?

51:58.483 --> 52:01.584
- [Man] Okay, I'm done
with the question game.

52:01.586 --> 52:04.587
Let's go.
(grunts)

52:04.589 --> 52:05.589
I'll drive.

52:18.235 --> 52:21.137
- [Sherry] Oh, I
fucking hate you.

52:21.872 --> 52:24.740
- [Man] I fucking hate me, too.

52:28.645 --> 52:30.779
- Can we just be friends?

52:32.282 --> 52:35.317
- [Man] If that's what you want.

52:35.319 --> 52:36.619
- No.

52:36.621 --> 52:39.188
I don't know. What am I doing?

52:41.158 --> 52:42.858
- [Man] Stop thinking.

52:46.630 --> 52:48.564
- [Sherry] Just do
one thing, okay?

52:48.566 --> 52:49.798
- What's that?

52:53.537 --> 52:55.171
- Whatever happens,

52:56.740 --> 52:58.174
be nice to me.

53:13.356 --> 53:14.657
Hey, come here.

53:16.526 --> 53:19.328
Come here, I got
something for you.

53:19.330 --> 53:20.729
Come here. Jojo.

53:24.668 --> 53:26.368
You want this?

53:26.370 --> 53:27.570
(recorder beeps)

53:27.572 --> 53:28.771
- [Abbie] Hi, it's Abbie.

53:28.773 --> 53:31.774
Sorry it's taken me a
week to call you back.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.509
It's been crazy at home.

53:33.511 --> 53:36.412
Well, I hope all is going
well with the salon idea,

53:36.414 --> 53:37.746
but I don't think
you've taken our talk

53:37.748 --> 53:40.249
about finances seriously.

53:40.251 --> 53:41.884
It just seems like another
one of your schemes

53:41.886 --> 53:44.353
that never pans out.

53:44.355 --> 53:46.455
Sometimes I feel like
you'll never face reality

53:46.457 --> 53:47.723
and grow up.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.358
When I took in Alice,

53:49.360 --> 53:51.560
I thought you would
get your life on track,

53:51.562 --> 53:53.395
but now it's been 10 years,

53:53.397 --> 53:56.799
and you just seem stuck
in the same place.

53:56.801 --> 53:58.567
You need to think long and hard

53:58.569 --> 53:59.735
about the choices you're making,

53:59.737 --> 54:02.705
and the kind of
person you want to be.

54:02.707 --> 54:06.242
I know Alice misses
you, and I love you,

54:06.244 --> 54:07.710
despite everything.

54:09.246 --> 54:11.847
Let me think about it, and
maybe we can work out a plan.

54:11.849 --> 54:16.018
You really need to step
up and contribute money...

54:23.727 --> 54:24.960
- [Blond Woman]
Where are my clips?

54:24.962 --> 54:26.729
- I have a feeling
about tonight.

54:26.731 --> 54:30.766
- [Blond Woman] Oh yeah? Did
you read today's horoscope?

54:32.569 --> 54:33.736
- [Sherry] What does it say?

54:33.738 --> 54:35.571
- Hold on, hold on.

54:36.473 --> 54:37.773
I always forget you're a Taurus.

54:37.775 --> 54:39.308
- I have settling instincts.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.677
- [Blond Woman] Girl,
you are so flighty.

54:41.679 --> 54:43.312
- Danny, what does it say?

54:43.314 --> 54:46.482
- All right, the new
moon will bring you

54:46.484 --> 54:49.051
unexpected and
exciting encounters.

54:49.053 --> 54:51.487
Be open to new possibilities.

54:51.489 --> 54:53.889
Ooh, you will meet the man
of your dreams tonight.

54:53.891 --> 54:55.624
- Does it say that?

54:55.626 --> 54:57.826
- [Danny] Oh, god damn it.

54:57.828 --> 55:00.696
Oh, this shit's
so expensive, too.

55:00.698 --> 55:01.997
Do not read that.

55:04.534 --> 55:06.435
- Please burn it.

55:08.438 --> 55:10.939
- [Danny] That's a good idea.

55:11.808 --> 55:15.711
My horoscope did say
to take up a new hobby.

55:17.881 --> 55:21.450
(indistinct conversation)

55:24.822 --> 55:27.923
- Oh, god, what
took you so long?

55:27.925 --> 55:29.725
- [Ted] I ran into
a friend from work.

55:29.727 --> 55:31.393
- What's his name?

55:31.395 --> 55:32.628
- Paul.

55:32.630 --> 55:34.530
- I could date a Paul.

55:34.532 --> 55:35.798
- His wife just gave birth.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.866
He's out having a
drink to celebrate.

55:37.868 --> 55:40.502
- Shouldn't he be at home with
his wife and newborn child?

55:40.504 --> 55:42.638
- Mm-mm, she's still
in the hospital.

55:42.640 --> 55:43.672
- That doesn't make any sense.

55:43.674 --> 55:44.907
He should be by her bedside.

55:44.909 --> 55:46.408
- She's asleep.

55:46.410 --> 55:47.409
- It doesn't matter.

55:47.411 --> 55:51.780
- She told him to go out and
get a drink and celebrate.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.782
- Well honey, I don't
care what she told him,

55:53.784 --> 55:55.084
he shouldn't be doing that.

55:55.086 --> 55:57.019
Having a beer with his buddies.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.821
- Okay, is there something
that I should know about?

55:58.823 --> 56:00.055
Is this...

56:00.057 --> 56:01.690
- He should be with
the wife he loves

56:01.692 --> 56:04.927
not having drinks with
some dudes in a bar.

56:04.929 --> 56:05.928
- [Ted] Interesting.

56:05.930 --> 56:06.929
- Hey, hey, hey,
where you going?

56:06.931 --> 56:07.663
- [Sherry] Bathroom.

56:07.665 --> 56:08.665
- Hold on.

56:09.566 --> 56:11.533
You just think on that.

56:12.936 --> 56:16.438
- I know we haven't talked
about this in a while, but

56:16.440 --> 56:18.440
I really think this is the one.

56:18.442 --> 56:20.776
- What are you talking about?

56:20.778 --> 56:23.679
- The space for the salon.

56:23.681 --> 56:24.947
- Are you joking?

56:25.949 --> 56:27.683
- No.

56:27.685 --> 56:30.486
Listen to me,
okay, listen to me.

56:31.621 --> 56:33.956
It's not very big
and it might cost

56:33.958 --> 56:37.726
But I really think
it could work out.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.962
- I don't know how
I feel about this.

56:39.964 --> 56:41.797
- Well, be excited or something.

56:41.799 --> 56:43.966
- Oh, hold on, you got
an eyelash by your nose.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.801
- Where?
- Right here.

56:47.871 --> 56:51.073
- I'm not in the
mood for wishes.

56:51.075 --> 56:53.609
- Can we, like, sit down
and really talk about this?

56:53.611 --> 56:56.678
Like the money situation?
Where it's coming from?

56:56.680 --> 56:58.981
I don't have any money.
Ted doesn't have any.

56:58.983 --> 57:00.115
And you certainly don't.

57:00.117 --> 57:01.583
- I'm working on it.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.485
- Okay, what does that mean?

57:03.487 --> 57:06.054
- It means I'm looking
into getting a loan.

57:06.056 --> 57:09.191
- A loan, do you even
know what that entails?

57:09.193 --> 57:10.926
- I'm figuring it out.

57:10.928 --> 57:11.960
- Okay, hon, but you know a bank

57:11.962 --> 57:13.962
isn't just gonna give you money.

57:13.964 --> 57:15.597
There's like a whole process
you have to go through.

57:15.599 --> 57:16.432
- I know, I know.

57:16.434 --> 57:18.467
Don't get all crazy now.

57:18.469 --> 57:19.668
- Well, let's just, you know,

57:19.670 --> 57:21.670
talk about it before
you do anything drastic.

57:21.672 --> 57:23.972
- We're talking about it now.

57:23.974 --> 57:25.941
- I know, but I want
to sit down in daylight

57:25.943 --> 57:28.043
and really discuss it.

57:29.179 --> 57:30.846
- [Sherry] I'll get you
something. What do you want?

57:30.848 --> 57:32.147
- Oh, grab Ted and I a
couple of beers, will you?

57:32.149 --> 57:33.949
Oh, I don't have any cash now.

57:33.951 --> 57:34.983
- I'll get it.

57:37.721 --> 57:39.988
- What's up Sherry?
Whiskey sour again?

57:39.990 --> 57:41.857
- Yeah, same old.

57:41.859 --> 57:44.993
And two beers for Ted and Danny.

57:44.995 --> 57:45.928
- You'll all here?

57:45.930 --> 57:47.563
- Yeah, Danny's birthday.

57:47.565 --> 57:49.031
- Yeah?

57:49.033 --> 57:50.833
Wish her well for me.

57:59.008 --> 58:01.043
It's on the house.

58:01.045 --> 58:02.144
- You don't have to do that.

58:02.146 --> 58:03.812
- [Bartender] It's no problem.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.547
- You know what,
you're too nice.

58:05.549 --> 58:06.949
You're too nice.

58:15.525 --> 58:18.060
Can you add a bit more whiskey?

58:18.062 --> 58:21.897
It's sweet, it's
too sweet for me.

58:21.899 --> 58:24.032
- Yeah, whatever you say.

58:39.082 --> 58:40.082
- Her?

58:42.086 --> 58:43.752
- I didn't know you were here.

58:43.754 --> 58:44.754
- Fuck you!

58:46.956 --> 58:48.056
Fuck.

58:51.961 --> 58:53.128
I'm leaving.

58:53.130 --> 58:54.963
- Hey, is everything okay?

58:54.965 --> 58:56.765
- I don't feel well.

58:56.767 --> 58:58.634
- Well, hold on.
I'll go with you.

58:58.636 --> 59:00.068
- No, I don't want
to ruin your night.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.303
- It's no big deal.

59:01.305 --> 59:04.573
- Here, have
another round on me.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.542
I'll call you tomorrow.

59:13.883 --> 59:16.151
(dog whines)

59:32.902 --> 59:35.103
- It'll be over in a minute.

59:37.073 --> 59:40.175
(indistinct TV voices)

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.866
- She said he had him so scared,

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:41.069
he was even making
with the wedding talk,

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.904
just to keep her quiet.

01:00:42.906 --> 01:00:44.206
- [Sherry Reading]
Never allow yourself

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.708
to be sad or disappointed.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:50.078
Remain steady and undaunted,
no matter what happens,

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.980
and you will not fail.

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:56.051
And seen and unseen
forces will reward you

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:59.988
with ever-increasing
success and prosperity.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.898
- Hello, Mr. Gilmore.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.136
Hello, Mr. Gilmore.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:42.297
(indistinct yelling)

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.078
- [Masked Man] You,

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.713
where's your car?

01:01:57.715 --> 01:01:58.814
Where's your car!

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:00.716
Get your hands off me!
- Show me!

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:01.483
Show me your car!

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:02.718
Go to the car. Open the car.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.985
- I'm ordering you!

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:07.089
- [Masked Man] Stop
yelling. Open the car.

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:08.056
Open it!

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.292
- Can't you see I'm trying?

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.394
- [Masked Man] Quickly.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:13.762
Get in there.
- Ow!

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.797
- Get in the car.
- God.

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:17.332
- [Masked Man] Drive!

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.752
(coughing)

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.423
- Listen, I don't know
what you want from me,

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.292
but if you want me to
drop you off somewhere,

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:45.494
I could do that.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:46.496
And,

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.264
and then I'll leave.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.298
And I won't tell anybody.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.033
- Just keep driving.

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.406
(coughing)

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.010
Pull over here.

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.315
(coughing)

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:17.192
- Can you get me something?

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.894
- Are you fucking with me?

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:21.797
- I just want some
water, come on.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:25.433
- You're putting these on.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:28.303
- Aw, come on,
that's not necessary.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.871
Aw, don't do that.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.974
- Make sure you
don't try anything.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.309
- What do you want me to do?

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.577
I mean you, I'm stuck.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:38.346
You've taken everything I have.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.282
I can't go anywhere.

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:49.150
- Here's your water.

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.491
What are you, crazy lady?

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:03.531
- Yeah, the door jams sometimes.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.402
Now hand over the gun.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.574
- I'm not giving you my gun.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.176
(gun fires)

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:16.444
- Sheez, what are
you fucking crazy?

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:18.914
There's people around.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:21.383
Okay, take the gun and drive.

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.286
Take the gun.

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.425
- Put these on.

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.096
- [Man] For god's sake.

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.531
- Where's the key?

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:37.699
- It's in my pocket.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:38.533
- Which one?

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.468
- The breast pocket.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:46.441
(wheezing)

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:51.079
- Are you okay?
- Just drive.

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:52.280
- You don't look so good.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.182
- Just leave me alone.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.421
(coughing)

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:13.468
- [Sherry] Where are
the keys to the house?

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:17.505
- They're under the flower pot.

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:19.174
- [Sherry] Get 'em.

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.093
Show me around.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:43.064
- This isn't an open house.

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.033
- Just show me all the rooms,

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:47.202
and then I'll let you go.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.639
- This is the living room.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.585
- You don't have a television.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.655
- I don't care for it, frankly.

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:15.163
- I don't know what I'd
do without a television.

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:18.133
Do you like old movies?

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:21.503
- I don't know, I guess so.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.374
- I like to watch old movies.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.610

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.466
- This is the kitchen.

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:53.835
It's kind of sparse,
but it's fine.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:54.837
I grill, mostly.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.843
- It's a nice size
for a kitchen.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:12.287
- This room has been
empty for a while.

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:14.522
My son lives with his mom.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.594
- Can I see a picture?

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.602
- His name's Ricky.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.607
Do you have any children?

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.678
- Where's the bedroom?

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.381
- Down the hall.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.220
- Show me.

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:53.694
- [Man] Mind taking these
handcuffs off already?

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:57.631
You got a gun pointed
at me, for god's sake.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.751
- Sit down on the bed.

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:20.688
- [Man] I'm not doing too well.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.890
- Yeah, what's wrong with you?

01:09:22.893 --> 01:09:23.725
- My kidneys.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.460
You see that machine?

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:26.694
I have to hook myself up to that

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:28.830
or I'm gonna be
doing a lot worse.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:31.432
- [Sherry] How does it work?

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.703
- [Man] The belt
with the tube in it

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.173
has to go around me.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:40.575
Tube connects to my stomach.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:57.792
- Here.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:00.929
Let me help you.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.366
- [Man] Be gentle.

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:22.717
- [Sherry] You
need to relax now.

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.532
- This is gonna take all night.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:43.938
- I want to watch you.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:55.950
Have you ever fucked on one
of these machines before?

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:58.920
- Why would you even ask that?

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.622
That would be nuts.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.457
- I want to fuck you.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.693
- Are you kidding?

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:08.429
- I'll get ya hard, don't worry.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:13.568
- [Man] I barely have enough
energy to stay awake right now.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:15.803
- Come on, let's just try.

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.789
- You are nuts.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.057
- Don't say that.

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:38.526
- You seriously...
- Don't say that.

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:39.761
Just be quiet.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.950
Well, I guess
this'll have to do.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:12.827
How do you feel?

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:18.733
- Not very
comfortable, obviously.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:22.837

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:26.407
it's not that bad, is it?

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.656
Are you all right?

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:05.079
You know what?

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:07.682
I don't even know your name.

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.590

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:17.592

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.928
That's a good name.

you mind me asking

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:40.715
what you were doing
with a gun today?

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.483
You don't strike me
as the kind of person

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.952
who would carry around a gun.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:51.926
- Well, I wasn't planning
on holding up a bank

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.529
or anything like that.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:57.165
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:03.971

could put the gun down now?

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.607
- Oh, yeah, of course.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.143
This is me putting down the gun.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.851
- Would you mind helping me

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.520
change the quilt?

01:14:19.522 --> 01:14:23.658
