WEBVTT

00:05.271 --> 00:10.409
Love me tender,
love me dear

00:10.411 --> 00:14.079
Tell me you are mine

00:15.615 --> 00:17.616
I'll be yours

00:17.618 --> 00:21.086
Through all the years

00:21.088 --> 00:24.490
Till the end of time

00:26.159 --> 00:31.397
When at last
my dreams come true

00:31.399 --> 00:35.134
Darling, this I know

00:36.636 --> 00:42.174
Happiness will follow you

00:42.176 --> 00:47.346
Just before I go.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.680
( birds chirping )

01:11.337 --> 01:13.672
My name is Ted Morgan.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.375
Right now I'm moments
away from death.

01:17.477 --> 01:19.812
No reason for you
to feel bad, though.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.580
I mean, I don't.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.415
This is actually
the first time in my life

01:23.417 --> 01:25.818
that I've accomplished something
I set out to do.

01:27.353 --> 01:30.355
And it's fitting for me
to die here in Lake Wamsutta

01:30.357 --> 01:32.758
because, to be honest,
it's probably the only place

01:32.760 --> 01:35.160
I ever really felt alive.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.863
I used to come here
with my dad when I was a kid,

01:38.131 --> 01:40.011
but we didn't
come here to fish.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.868
No, we had bigger plans.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.403
See that thing in the sign?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.305
That's Wammy,
my hometown's answer

01:46.307 --> 01:48.173
to the Loch Ness monster.

01:48.175 --> 01:50.209
But Wammy was real.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.411
We had actual footage
shot by my dad,

01:52.413 --> 01:55.180
plus eyewitness accounts
from local alcoholics.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.651
My dad saw the good
in everything.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.889
He taught me that the world
was a safe and decent place.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.791
Only it wasn't.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.560
He got sick and before I knew
it...

02:08.562 --> 02:10.762
he was gone.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.432
My brother Lucky
comforted me that day

02:13.434 --> 02:15.801
for the first and only time
in his life.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.270
But he couldn't
take my dad's place.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.540
Go! Sit!
What's wrong with you?!

02:21.542 --> 02:24.843
Ted: In the movies,
a sympathetic teacher often
steps up.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.213
But Edwina Lawrence
never went to the movies.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.283
I used my art to express myself

02:31.285 --> 02:33.318
and I showed them.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.655
But then they showed me.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.625
- They took my best friend.
- ( dog whimpers )

02:41.794 --> 02:43.262
( barks )

02:43.264 --> 02:47.232
My mother never found a man
to replace my dad either.

02:47.234 --> 02:49.568
So she fell in love
with the King...

02:49.570 --> 02:51.637
named Shirley.

02:51.639 --> 02:55.607
Meanwhile, I was being tortured
by the school bully,

02:55.609 --> 02:57.309
Rawly Stansfield.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.378
So when I was old enough,

02:59.380 --> 03:01.446
I moved as far away
as I could

03:01.448 --> 03:03.949
and I never thought
of Wammy again.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.885
It was a silly thing
to believe in anyway.

03:07.153 --> 03:09.888
As you can tell
by where I am right now,

03:09.890 --> 03:11.857
life never got much better.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.360
So I went out west
where I just blended in.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.331
I worked my way up
to a mid-level job

03:19.333 --> 03:22.534
at a mid-level company...

03:22.536 --> 03:24.870
and watched the years go by,

03:24.872 --> 03:27.539
all from the safety
of a mid-level life.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.608
( TV playing )

03:32.412 --> 03:34.546
Hey, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.784
- Ted: And then I met Penny.
- ( grunts ) Here we go.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.519
Wow, he's really heavy.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.521
I'm Penny.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.789
I'm Ted.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.328
For three years,
she was everything to me.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.296
Everything I wasn't.

03:51.298 --> 03:54.766
( screams, laughs )

03:54.768 --> 03:56.935
Ted:
Penny loved life

03:57.203 --> 03:58.937
and I loved Penny.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.939
Unfortunately,
so did Nate,

04:00.941 --> 04:02.574
her guitar teacher.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.311
( Penny moans )

04:08.648 --> 04:12.417
Do you think this is
how I wanted it to end, Ted?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.753
I thought that we could
grow together,

04:14.755 --> 04:17.889
but you are stuck.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.392
What am I supposed
to do without you?

04:20.394 --> 04:22.594
What did you ever do
with me, Ted?

04:22.596 --> 04:25.731
You have no passion

04:25.733 --> 04:28.867
and I don't wanna
end up like you.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.702
You might as well be dead.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.974
Ted:
Maybe she was right.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.343
Maybe I should just end it.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.413
( crying )

04:41.415 --> 04:44.549
Ted: After all, there was no one
left
to talk me out of it.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.784
( computer keys clicking )

04:45.786 --> 04:48.587
( beeping )

04:48.589 --> 04:51.056
( computer keys clicking )

04:51.324 --> 04:53.684
Ted: Even total strangers
agreed that I was wasting air.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.901
It was obvious to me.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.903
It was time to punch out.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.473
( barking, howling )

05:13.946 --> 05:17.783
Ted: But I didn't want
to go out like this guy.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.654
My life had been
a complete failure, sure,

05:22.656 --> 05:24.696
but at least I could get
my death right.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.569
I needed to go back to Kempton
and confront my own predators.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.373
Just before I go.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.621
Hey, Ted!

05:56.623 --> 05:59.691
Teddy!
Over here!

06:03.596 --> 06:05.430
You got shotgun.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.634
Honey! Kids!

06:09.636 --> 06:11.970
They're gonna freak out.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.906
Hey,
everybody gather round.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.742
( laughs )

06:16.744 --> 06:18.076
Here.
You sit here.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.112
No, no, you stay.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.915
Okay, okay, fam damily.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.485
You all remember
your Uncle Ted?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.086
He's my only brother.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.488
He's gonna be
staying with us for a while.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.090
- We know, Dad.
- Right...

06:32.092 --> 06:34.126
but what you don't know
is why.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.094
And, uh...
can I be frank here, Teddy?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.830
- Preferably not.
- Your Uncle Ted's here

06:38.832 --> 06:42.067
'cause your Aunt Penny,
who you only met, like, twice

06:42.069 --> 06:43.568
a hundred years ago,

06:43.570 --> 06:45.737
and now... warning,
I'm gonna talk to you

06:45.739 --> 06:47.939
like we're adults now...
Is a cunt.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.011
- Okay, I'm a little sleepy.
- Now, those of you who know me

06:53.013 --> 06:55.647
know that I don't
throw that word around lightly.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.816
It's an ugly word,
it's a disgusting word.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.585
Great orifice.
Gives us babies,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.654
but it's a terrible word
sometimes,

07:02.656 --> 07:04.589
but your aunt is a cunt.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.591
So I never want to hear
the word "Penny"

07:06.593 --> 07:07.959
spoken ever again.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.828
When you think
you want to say "Penny,"

07:09.830 --> 07:09.828
you say "cunt" instead.

07:09.830 --> 07:14.800
What if we want to cash in
a roll of pennies at the bank?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.568
- Do we say it then?
- No.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.250
You look that teller in the eye
and you say

07:18.471 --> 07:20.872
you would like some cash
for this roll of cunts.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.974
You have my permission.
I'll sign a slip or something.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.076
- Luck, come on.
- I'm sorry, I digress.

07:25.078 --> 07:28.613
And even though
he's been kind of a dick

07:28.615 --> 07:32.617
for barely calling or anything
for the past two years,

07:32.619 --> 07:34.119
doesn't matter anymore...

07:35.688 --> 07:37.928
( voice cracking )
'cause my baby brother's back.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.992
( Lucky grunts )

07:44.130 --> 07:46.531
Okay, I'm getting
a little emotional here.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.447
And you all know
I break things when I cry,

07:49.469 --> 07:52.971
so I'm gonna let
little brother Ted speak.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.806
Uh...

07:56.108 --> 07:57.876
Hi.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.778
I know it's been a long time
since I've been back here

07:59.780 --> 08:03.114
and just want to thank you guys
for letting me stay with you

08:03.116 --> 08:06.952
during this...
transition period.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.754
- My breakup with your Aunt
Penny...
- Cunt.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.725
Aunt... Cunt...

08:13.727 --> 08:16.628
has been difficult.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.030
It's nice to have family
to turn to.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.601
Well, Teddy, we're really happy
that you're here staying with
us.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.770
Honey, enough speeches.
Give the man a break.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.806
He just flew 3,000 miles.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.248
- Let's get this man some food.
- Ow!

08:29.442 --> 08:31.910
- ( clears throat )
- Oh, God.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.846
All right, here we go.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.847
Bathroom's in there.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.089
Ted: Your dad said
you drew these.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.891
You're talented.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.293
( scoffs )
Well, they're shit,

08:48.561 --> 08:49.828
but thanks.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.232
What's with the deadbolt?

08:55.735 --> 08:57.575
You're gonna want
to use that.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.006
Dad will tell you.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.908
- Good?
- Yeah.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.090
Kathleen?

09:23.262 --> 09:25.263
Whoa.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.025
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kathleen!

09:28.200 --> 09:30.135
( laughs nervously )

09:30.137 --> 09:31.336
What are you doing?

09:31.604 --> 09:34.005
- ( moaning )
- No, don't do that.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.343
- That's a bad idea, Kathleen.
- ( moaning )

09:38.611 --> 09:42.147
It's a bad idea.
You should go back to bed, okay?

09:42.149 --> 09:44.683
No!
No! No!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.251
( moaning )

09:46.253 --> 09:48.753
My God,
it's like you're playing banjo.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.255
( moaning louder )

09:50.523 --> 09:52.257
Oh, jeez.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.928
- Oh, shit.
- ( whimpering )

09:56.930 --> 09:59.130
Lucky, I was sleeping.
She just walked in, I swear.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.734
- I don't know...
- Shh. You're gonna wake her.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.103
You never wake
a sleep masturbator.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.939
- What?
- I'll explain in the morning.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.009
Didn't Zeke tell you
to deadbolt the door?

10:11.011 --> 10:13.979
Okay, honey,
beddie-bye time.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.815
- Come on.
- ( Kathleen sighs )

10:16.817 --> 10:18.683
Yeah, yeah.
Shh.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.688
Oh, hey.
Hey, Teddy,

10:23.690 --> 10:26.091
there's banana cream pie
in the fridge if you get hungry,
okay?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.926
I'm good.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.761
I can't...

10:39.872 --> 10:42.140
Boy: Mom, I can't find
any clean pants.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.075
- Look in your closet.
- Ah, shit!

10:44.077 --> 10:46.244
Oh...
I'm sorry, honey.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.914
- Boy: What?!
- Ugh, for the love of Pete.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.858
Yeah, it's been going on
for the past few years.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.394
Every time someone sleeps over,
she sleepwalks in there,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.229
starts rubbing her button,

11:04.231 --> 11:06.097
two minutes later it sounds like
a chick's hatching.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.134
- Is she seeing a doctor?
- They gave her this Zoloft
shit,

11:09.136 --> 11:11.376
but she still does all the same
crazy sleep stuff.

11:12.638 --> 11:14.739
Wow.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.908
You should see the things she
does
to me when she's sleeping.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.045
She punches me,
slaps me, kicks me.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.447
She took a shit on my pillow
right next to my head.

11:22.715 --> 11:27.285
I'm talking this giant rosebud,
like, inches from my eyebrows.

11:27.287 --> 11:31.423
I'd kill to wake up and find her
knuckle-deep in her own pussy.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.992
Jeez.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.794
I'm sorry, Luck.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.162
Well, fuck it.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.097
Gonna see Mom today?

11:39.099 --> 11:40.765
The Monte Carlo's
at your disposal.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.934
I got something I gotta do
first.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.803
Dude, you gotta see Mom.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.372
Of course, yeah, I will.
I just...

11:47.374 --> 11:49.207
gotta do this thing first.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.257
Good morning,

12:06.259 --> 12:09.160
I'm looking for one
of your old people.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.263
- Edwina Lawrence.
- Friend or family?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.865
Actually, I'm one of her
former students.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.366
She was my
seventh grade teacher.

12:15.368 --> 12:19.137
Oh, and you've come back
after all these years to visit.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.507
- How sweet.
- Yeah.

12:22.775 --> 12:27.479
- ( coughing )
- 42, 43... ha-ha, oh, Shirley.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.415
- ( whistling ) Hello.
- Ah, fuck you.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.417
( woman passes gas )
Okay.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.819
( woman #2 coughing )

12:35.921 --> 12:37.922
- ( meows )
- Hmm.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.991
( man coughing )

12:43.996 --> 12:46.064
( TV playing )

12:46.066 --> 12:47.499
Mrs. Lawrence?

12:50.035 --> 12:51.469
Mrs. Lawrence, it's Teddy.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.838
Ted Morgan.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.173
From the seventh grade?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.075
Are you stupid?!

12:57.077 --> 12:59.477
How many times
do I have to say it?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.412
The numerator
goes into the denominator.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.115
Four.
Four times!

13:04.117 --> 13:05.483
Take your seat.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.853
Go! Sit!
What's wrong with you?!

13:10.022 --> 13:13.024
I think some children
in this class know math, right?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.492
You were pretty mean to me.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.562
Actually, you were more
than just mean, you were cruel.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.865
Probably the cruelest person
I've ever met.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.334
I was popular
before seventh grade.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.937
I had friends.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.206
You made me a joke.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.509
You picked on me every day.
Why?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.344
I never did anything to you.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.381
( turns off TV )

13:36.383 --> 13:39.250
I was polite.
I was an A student.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.920
Jesus,
my father had just died!

13:41.922 --> 13:45.089
Why were you such a miserable
cocksucking bitch?!

13:45.091 --> 13:47.225
They took my dog Pepper
because of you.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.561
He was my best friend.
They took him away because of
you.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.530
I never saw him again.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.066
I flew 3,000 miles
to tell you how you set my life

13:55.068 --> 13:58.036
on the path to ruin
and this is funny to you?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.471
Well, fuck you!

14:00.473 --> 14:03.908
Fuck you, you dried-up,
withered, douchebag.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.611
Fuck you and the giant tarantula
you rode in on!

14:06.879 --> 14:08.513
You old clam!

14:08.781 --> 14:10.415
What the fuck are you
smiling about?!

14:10.417 --> 14:12.116
Ow! Jesus!

14:12.118 --> 14:13.985
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.120
What are you doing
calling my grandmother

14:16.122 --> 14:17.989
a withered old clam?
Help!

14:17.991 --> 14:19.457
Wait, wait, I can explain.
Ow!

14:19.459 --> 14:22.093
- Rape!
- Rape? Seriously?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.095
This is Massachusetts,
people still come running for
rape.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.430
- ( cat meows )
- ( gasps )

14:25.432 --> 14:27.532
Shh, don't move.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.234
- ( meows )
- Ted: What, the cat?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.969
It's not any cat.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.238
( gasps )

14:33.240 --> 14:35.440
No, no, no, no,
Grandma, no.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.976
Is she allergic?
You want me to get rid of it?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.944
No, you can't get rid of Death
Kitty.
If he comes into your room

14:39.946 --> 14:41.946
and sleeps on your bed,
you die.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.282
( meows )

14:44.284 --> 14:46.317
( sighs )

14:46.319 --> 14:47.619
Oh, thank God.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.154
Thank God.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.558
Who are you?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.627
You're serious?
You came back here

14:55.895 --> 14:57.595
to yell at my grandma,
fight a bully,

14:57.597 --> 14:59.597
and then kill yourself?

14:59.865 --> 15:02.033
Uh, isn't that a little fucked
up?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.135
I think that any plan
that ends with suicide

15:04.137 --> 15:06.304
is probably
a little fucked up, yeah.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.407
No kids?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.009
Nope.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.278
Is this like a cry for help?
Am I supposed to tell someone?

15:13.280 --> 15:17.582
- No, please don't.
- So I'm just supposed to walk
away

15:17.584 --> 15:20.652
and let you... kill yourself?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.687
I'm sorry.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.223
I'm an idiot, but, yes,
I was hoping so.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.530
Hey,
I know you don't think so,

15:32.532 --> 15:34.265
but someone is gonna care

15:34.267 --> 15:36.334
and they're gonna be
really pissed off

15:36.336 --> 15:38.670
and they most likely
won't ever forgive you.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.209
There's a time,
there was a point in time

15:45.211 --> 15:47.612
When we just stopped listening

15:47.880 --> 15:50.481
There's a ghost
and it haunts this town, yeah

15:50.483 --> 15:52.383
- It haunts it up and down...
- ( siren chirping )

15:52.385 --> 15:55.620
You're a mess,
you're a fucking mess

15:55.622 --> 15:58.089
If you don't know that by now...

15:58.091 --> 16:00.325
- Teddy! Oh, my God!
- Hey, Mom.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.094
- Oh...
- Good to see you.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.631
Oh, honey.
What a surprise.

16:06.899 --> 16:10.101
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

16:10.103 --> 16:13.271
Oh, Margaret Margolis.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.139
10% kidney function.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.741
No feet.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.243
I don't want you to ask

16:19.245 --> 16:20.511
- How I am...
- Hi, baby!

16:20.513 --> 16:22.213
- Hey.
- Let me look at you.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.650
I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay...

16:25.652 --> 16:29.654
- God. That's a sandwich.
- ( laughs ) Ooh.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.390
I can't tell you how good it is

16:32.392 --> 16:34.525
to see my baby boy again.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.127
- Thanks, Mom.
- Ooh.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.564
Let the boy breathe, Nance.
You're practically motorboatin'
him.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.265
- Oh...
- ( laughs )

16:41.267 --> 16:44.435
- It's good to see you, too,
Mom.
- How are things?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.137
- ( gasps )
- Shirley,

16:46.139 --> 16:48.473
do you have to do that
in the kitchen?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.241
Sorry, baby.
Sorry.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.576
So, Shirley,
how are you feeling?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.778
Good, Ted.
Can't complain.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.213
( imitates Elvis Presley )
Thank you very much, baby.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.348
- ( Ted chuckles )
- Shirley's making a comeback.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.318
- Really?
- Yeah, look at this.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.423
Wow.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.723
The Marshfield chili cook-off.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.492
Opening for Sha Na Na.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.261
You're gonna come, right?

17:12.164 --> 17:14.665
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.534
Mom, do you remember
Vickie Serrone?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.435
Oh, yeah, very nice girl.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.439
She works checkout
at Shaw's Supermarket.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.673
Wow.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.808
She's worked there
since high school.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.743
- Shelves, too.
- ( Shirley laughs )

17:27.012 --> 17:28.679
This girl knows
where everything is.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.648
Every aisle, every item.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.251
You just try to stump her.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.720
Two weeks ago
I went in there and I said, uh,

17:35.722 --> 17:37.522
"I'd like some capers."

17:37.524 --> 17:40.458
You know what she did?
She said, "Aisle seven, bottom
shelf."

17:40.460 --> 17:43.761
- Amazing.
- I don't even know what a caper
is.

17:44.029 --> 17:47.565
- Ouch!
- Shirley!

17:50.269 --> 17:52.336
Hey, big mama.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.740
- Where's my coffee?
- Almost ready, puddin'.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.342
You could've given me
a little heads up on Elvis'
comeback.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.612
More like "Love Me Tenderloin."
Woman is packing on the
poundage.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.183
Went to a pancake breakfast
with her last month...

18:05.185 --> 18:06.684
there was more batter
spread that day

18:06.686 --> 18:09.754
than on the inside
of a Boy Scout's sleeping bag.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.589
( both laugh )

18:13.659 --> 18:15.560
- ( giggling )
- What do you got back there?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.329
- A case of marshmallows?
- Oh. ( laughs )

18:21.767 --> 18:23.201
Mmm.
That is good.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.570
Oh, you put your
secret ingredient in there.

18:25.572 --> 18:26.737
Tell him what
your secret ingredient is.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.739
Love.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.676
Love.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.186
Ted on video:
You're so beautiful.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.792
Teddy, I'm trying to take a nap.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.527
- ( Ted laughs )
- Get out of here.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.330
Ted, I'm trying to sleep.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.365
( both laugh on video )

18:54.367 --> 18:56.207
Penny on video:
Get over here.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.351
What are you doing here?

19:13.353 --> 19:17.288
I've decided that I'm gonna
document
this suicide thing of yours.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.724
Jesus,
would you keep it down?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.459
And, no, absolutely not.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.727
Why?

19:22.729 --> 19:25.530
Look, I'm sorry
about your grandmother, okay?

19:25.532 --> 19:28.533
I'm sorry I told you
what I told you, but no way.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.834
Ted, think about it.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.670
When the end comes
and you have to write that note,

19:32.672 --> 19:35.406
I mean, the note,
explaining all this,

19:35.408 --> 19:38.709
you won't have to
because I will have edited
together

19:38.711 --> 19:41.712
a snappy little 30-minute
presentation
that will explain it all.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.881
- Why are you doing this?
- To help.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.716
Also, this is kind of my field.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.352
- You do documentaries?
- No, I work at Town Hall

19:48.354 --> 19:50.321
and I record
all of the town meetings,

19:50.323 --> 19:53.658
so, yeah, kind of a
documentarian,
record keeper.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.326
- Greta, right?
- Yeah.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.248
It was nice meeting you.
Goodbye.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.832
I'll tell.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.536
I'll tell your brother
what you're gonna do.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.538
I don't want to.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.907
I would much rather document
your impending death,

20:09.909 --> 20:11.642
but... it's your call.

20:14.479 --> 20:17.381
Yes!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.417
So let's rehash.

20:19.419 --> 20:23.754
So far you've screamed
at a 90-year-old lady

20:23.756 --> 20:25.890
and called her
a "cocksucking bitch,"

20:25.892 --> 20:27.458
and now you're going to
fist-fight

20:27.460 --> 20:29.727
someone you haven't seen
in 22 years?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.996
You've got to admit
that's a pretty fucked-up bucket
list.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.432
You ever heard of
"getting your house in order"?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.734
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm getting my house in order.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.470
Yeah, but why do
you have to kill yourself?

20:39.472 --> 20:42.306
Why not just right your wrongs
and then keep on going?

20:42.308 --> 20:44.942
Because...

20:44.944 --> 20:46.844
it's what we cowards do.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.926
So you're just gonna
walk up to this guy and say,

21:01.928 --> 21:04.795
"Hey, remember me?
You used to pick me up by the
nipples

21:04.797 --> 21:08.432
during gym class 20 years ago."
And then, wham?

21:08.434 --> 21:09.867
Pretty much.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.937
Hey, Ted, get up.

21:13.205 --> 21:16.474
I'm hungry.
Let's go, get out of here.

21:18.810 --> 21:22.580
Excuse me.
Uh, you wouldn't happen to have

21:22.582 --> 21:25.416
- any spare change, would you?
- Buzz off, loser.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.051
( girls snickering, laughing )

21:27.319 --> 21:29.687
- I have some change, Ted.
- Girl: So gross.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.055
Girl #2: Don't give him
any money, Vickie.

21:31.323 --> 21:32.723
He's just gonna give it
to Rawly Stansfield

21:32.725 --> 21:35.459
'cause he's too big a pussy
to stand up to him.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.862
( girl #2 laughs )

21:37.864 --> 21:39.363
Thanks.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.866
Thank you.
( grunts )

21:41.868 --> 21:43.634
Sorry about that.
Come on.

21:46.872 --> 21:48.439
Gross, dude,
it's fucking wet.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.608
Tomorrow I want dry money.
All right?

21:50.610 --> 21:52.510
Yeah.

21:54.546 --> 21:57.948
- Hi, is Rawly Stansfield here?
- Yeah, he's right there.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.584
( grunts )

22:00.586 --> 22:02.720
Please don't be Rawly.
Please don't be Rawly.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.689
- Please don't be Rawly.
- I'm Rawly.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.411
- Oh, shit.
- Rawly: Be with you in a
second.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.761
( grunts )

22:12.264 --> 22:14.932
Okay, let's go.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.634
No.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.503
Ted, I know that your list
is very important to you,

22:19.505 --> 22:21.706
but unless you've decided
to add having someone feed you

22:21.708 --> 22:23.741
your own legs,
I suggest we go.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.043
It's not a list.
It's just a few things.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.479
Besides, I'm armed.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.014
It's my brother's blackjack.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.116
It's filled with powdered lead,
you just...

22:32.384 --> 22:33.751
One blow
to the side of the head,

22:33.753 --> 22:36.420
he'll go down
like a ton of fertilizer.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.689
Ted, the man
just walked out of here

22:38.691 --> 22:40.758
with 200 pounds of hay
on his shoulders

22:40.760 --> 22:42.093
like it was a fucking parasol.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.995
I suggest you key his pick-up
and call it even.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.364
No.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.502
Jesus, it's like "Jurassic Park"
when he walks.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.437
You looking for me?

22:53.439 --> 22:54.839
Yeah.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.777
( sighs )
You don't remember me, do ya?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.612
No.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.614
I'm Ted.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.082
Ted Morgan.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.485
We went to school together.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.553
Teddy?!
( laughs )

23:09.555 --> 23:11.922
Teddy Morgan,
holy shit, man!

23:11.924 --> 23:15.059
Good to see you!
( laughs )

23:15.061 --> 23:17.061
What's going on?!

23:17.063 --> 23:19.143
What's it been?
Like 20 years or something?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.966
- ( groans )
- Ted, man...

23:21.968 --> 23:24.535
I was such a dick.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.138
A huge di...
I mean like the biggest dick.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.007
Mother of all dicks,
for sure.

23:30.009 --> 23:34.111
( sighs ) I think about it
all the time, too, you know?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.880
My dickness.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.816
I'm a totally different person,
you gotta believe me on this.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.918
I mean I...
I'm not such a dick anymore.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.054
I'm a pretty happy dude,
actually.
You know?

23:44.056 --> 23:46.757
Well, for what it's worth, I...

23:46.759 --> 23:49.794
I really appreciate you
acknowledging your dickness.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.763
You bet.
You deserve it, man.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.132
It all changed for me
when I met my wife.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.768
Uh... late wife.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.137
- Aw, sorry.
- Yeah.

24:00.405 --> 24:02.706
You remember her, Teddy?
Kathy Sorenson.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.575
Little bitty thing.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.943
She was president
of the French Club.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.425
- Ah.
- Remember she had a dead tooth,

24:07.479 --> 24:09.613
like, until eighth grade?
Kind of a bubble butt.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.148
- Yeah, sounds familiar.
- Yeah.

24:11.416 --> 24:13.050
How'd she pass?

24:13.052 --> 24:16.520
Uh, it was a...
It was an aneurism, actually.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.157
We have a son.
Henry.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.059
- All right.
- Yeah, he's just about the
sweetest kid

24:22.061 --> 24:23.527
you'd ever want to meet
in your whole life.

24:23.529 --> 24:25.129
- Man: Rawly!
- Sir.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.997
You know where I caught
this little guy?

24:26.999 --> 24:29.934
Throwing rabbit pellets
everywhere.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.136
I told you,
this ain't no goddamn day care.

24:32.404 --> 24:33.804
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry?!

24:33.806 --> 24:37.675
It's hard to tell
who the dummy is at times.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.477
( sighs )

24:41.646 --> 24:43.013
Hey, Henry,
how you doing?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.615
Come sit here with me.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.817
Want you to say hi to my friend.
Say "hi" to Ted.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.720
Hi, Ted.
( laughs )

24:49.722 --> 24:51.055
- That means he likes you.
- Hey.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.924
- This is Greta, his friend.
- Hottie. ( laughs )

24:59.631 --> 25:02.867
- ( clinks )
- ( door closes )

25:04.603 --> 25:06.770
Hey, baby bro.
You hungry?

25:06.772 --> 25:08.292
Kathleen really outdid
herself tonight.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.207
Meat loaf.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.742
I almost gave myself
a speeding ticket

25:11.744 --> 25:13.110
'cause I couldn't wait
to get home and dig in.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.079
Thanks.
I'm kind of tired.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.947
Lucky:
Oh, come on.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.916
It only tastes a little bit
like dog food.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.686
- ( growls )
- ( laughs )

25:28.193 --> 25:30.261
( squeaking )

25:32.197 --> 25:34.198
( clinks )

25:34.200 --> 25:35.799
( squeaking )

25:37.536 --> 25:39.670
( clinks )

26:02.160 --> 26:04.895
( groans )
Kathleen.

26:06.598 --> 26:07.898
- Oh, no.
- ( moans )

26:07.900 --> 26:09.266
Come on!

26:09.534 --> 26:10.935
( moaning )

26:10.937 --> 26:13.103
( groans )
You know what? Just speed it up.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.772
Speed it up.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.741
( moans )

26:17.743 --> 26:19.009
How come you never
hear her get out of bed?

26:19.011 --> 26:21.979
Shut up.
How come you don't deadbolt the
door?

26:21.981 --> 26:24.348
- Ted: I did!
- ( contented sigh )

26:30.589 --> 26:32.222
( door closes )

26:34.726 --> 26:37.094
Hey, guys,
find a cunt, pick it up,

26:37.096 --> 26:39.129
all day long
you've got good luck.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.098
( laughing )

26:43.868 --> 26:47.204
I'm having to rethink
this whole Penny/cunt thing.

26:47.206 --> 26:50.007
Ted, school starts
in 15 minutes.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.977
I'll meet you in the car.
All right?

26:52.979 --> 26:54.945
( school bell rings )

26:54.947 --> 26:57.348
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.150
Whether 'tis nobler to suck
dick.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.319
Will you fu...
Leave him the fuck alone.

27:02.587 --> 27:05.289
What? What do you got against
having a little fun, dude?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.225
So, Romeo, what is it?
Are you a top or a bottom?

27:08.227 --> 27:11.061
( laughs )
What, you don't remember, Pete?

27:12.230 --> 27:15.065
That afternoon under the
bleachers
must have meant nothing to you,
huh?

27:15.067 --> 27:17.835
( boys laughing )

27:17.837 --> 27:19.837
- Fuck you.
- Stop! Stop.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.372
Relax.
Will you get the fuck outta
here?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.742
Stop.
Come on, man.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.176
( car horn honks )

27:26.178 --> 27:27.411
Hey,

27:27.679 --> 27:30.848
you were supposed
to pick me up this morning.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.784
Hello,
I am talking to you.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.153
I'm trying to film
a suicide note here.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.988
Can you stop
and help a girl out, please?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.323
You know why
I didn't pick you up?

27:39.325 --> 27:41.158
Because this is none
of your business, that's why.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.227
Oh, oh, okay.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.996
Fine.

27:47.098 --> 27:50.300
Yeah, hi, is this
the police department?

27:50.302 --> 27:53.037
I need to speak with
the chief of police right away.

27:53.039 --> 27:56.306
It's an emergency.
It involves a family member.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.076
- Yeah, I can hold.
- You're full of shit.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.178
- Oh, really?
- ( music playing on
speakerphone )

28:01.180 --> 28:03.147
Do you hear that?
That's Scandal.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.669
That's the official hold music
for the Kempton police
department.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.752
It's really too bad, too,
because I have this way

28:08.754 --> 28:11.155
of helping you cross a thing
off your list.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.793
Shootin' at the walls
of heartache

28:15.795 --> 28:17.227
Bang, bang

28:17.229 --> 28:19.797
I am the warrior...

28:21.332 --> 28:24.234
Well, I am the warrior...

28:24.236 --> 28:27.371
- Why aren't you buying
anything?
- 'Cause I don't want anything.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.413
I heard an old friend works
here.
Thought I'd say hi.

28:29.674 --> 28:32.209
Hmm, okay.
Well, fine by me.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.411
I needed a box
of emergency plugs anyway.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.814
I'm more at the tail end
of my period,

28:36.816 --> 28:40.217
so it's kind of a precaution,
but, you know, good to have.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.886
If it's okay with you,
maybe we could keep a little
mystery

28:42.888 --> 28:44.288
with our totally not knowing
each other at all?

28:44.290 --> 28:47.491
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Did I share too much,

28:47.759 --> 28:50.027
Mr. I'm Gonna Kill Myself?

28:50.029 --> 28:52.329
Ted Morgan?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.897
Vickie Serrone?

28:53.899 --> 28:55.799
I have some change, Ted.

28:59.437 --> 29:00.804
Thanks.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.911
- Wow.
- Vickie: Where have you been?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.280
I haven't seen you in years.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.916
I've been living
out in Los Angeles.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.451
You visiting
your mom and Lucky?

29:14.719 --> 29:16.820
Uh, yeah.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.856
Yeah, it's been
a long time, so...

29:18.858 --> 29:20.991
Anyways,
what have you been up to?

29:20.993 --> 29:23.193
- You look great.
- ( scoffs )

29:23.195 --> 29:25.062
Ted, it's okay,
I've seen my reflection.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.998
My feet, no,
but my reflection...

29:28.000 --> 29:30.167
- Are you married?
- ( laughs )

29:30.169 --> 29:33.203
I sure as hell wouldn't let
myself
get like this if I wasn't.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.372
I'm Vickie Dansik now.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.442
- Five kids.
- Five?! Wow.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.344
Is this your wife?

29:40.346 --> 29:43.347
Um... no, no.
She's, um...

29:44.716 --> 29:48.352
Greta.
I'm a... friend of the family.

29:48.354 --> 29:51.388
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.857
I'd love to catch up.
Maybe we could go out for a
drink.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.426
- Sure.
- Great.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.128
Let me get your number.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.867
I'm sorry.
What was that all about?

30:03.869 --> 30:06.436
She was one of the few people
who was ever kind to me.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.172
Is that enough info?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.340
Yeah, but what do you
have to catch up on?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.975
I mean,
you're gonna kill yourself.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.112
What, are you trying to drum up
attendance at your funeral?

30:15.114 --> 30:19.082
Holy shit, she's like
a part of your list, isn't she?

30:19.084 --> 30:20.951
I mean,
I don't know what part,

30:20.953 --> 30:23.387
- but am I right?
- So what if she is?

30:23.389 --> 30:27.191
- Look, are we done today?
- You are one sick fuck.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.525
I'm glad you're amused.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.595
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, really.

30:31.863 --> 30:33.597
Look, you can go,
you can do your thing,

30:33.865 --> 30:35.399
but we have to do
one thing first.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.001
Trust me, this is a stop
you're gonna want to make.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.605
Okay, so, they give her
her meds at 10:00.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.107
It's 11:00 now.
This is when she's most
coherent.

30:44.109 --> 30:46.243
So the rules are,
you can tell her

30:46.245 --> 30:48.245
what your beef is... period.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.948
You can say you hate her
or whatever else you want,

30:50.950 --> 30:53.383
but no shouting,
no swearing,

30:53.385 --> 30:55.252
no obscene gestures,
got it?

30:55.254 --> 30:58.188
- Can I flick her in the
forehead?
- No! You can shake the bed a
little.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.923
( meows )

31:06.331 --> 31:07.865
( Greta sighs )

31:11.936 --> 31:14.338
Greta:
My dad left when I was three.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.607
I remember that
they were fighting.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.143
I was sweeping.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.946
I started hitting him
in the foot with the broom.

31:24.582 --> 31:28.252
Then I was yelling,
"Stop, stop."

31:28.254 --> 31:31.555
And then the next time
I saw him was...

31:31.557 --> 31:33.557
right after my mom died.

31:33.825 --> 31:38.028
I thought that he was coming
to take me with him...

31:38.030 --> 31:40.430
'cause he brought me
this big bag of candy.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.433
Like bigger than my head
and a dress.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.438
And then that night
he and Nana got in a really big
fight

31:48.440 --> 31:50.641
and...

31:50.909 --> 31:52.576
the next day he was gone.

31:54.445 --> 31:57.514
And the next time
that I saw him was, um...

31:59.050 --> 32:02.586
two years later
at his funeral.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.556
I'm sorry.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.325
I know how hard it was
to lose a parent.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.227
I can't imagine losing both.

32:10.229 --> 32:13.630
You know, it wasn't losing
the actual them that was so hard

32:13.898 --> 32:17.301
'cause they weren't really there
to begin with, but...

32:17.303 --> 32:19.303
it was the idea...

32:21.606 --> 32:23.674
of them that was crippling.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.516
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.451
Are you good
at climbing trees?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.620
What?

32:38.489 --> 32:41.558
- Ted: Oh, shit, this is high.
- ( chuckles )

32:41.560 --> 32:44.494
Relax, worst-case scenario,
you slip and die.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.696
Mission accomplished.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.634
What's that for?

32:50.902 --> 32:52.302
Carve your initials.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.204
See?

32:54.206 --> 32:56.306
Susan plus Greta.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.675
That's me and my mom.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.478
We came up here,
like, the week before she died.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.581
Your mom climbed a tree
a week before she died of
cancer?

33:05.950 --> 33:08.452
Where there's a will,
you know?

33:08.454 --> 33:11.054
Anyway... carve.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.758
You have to
leave something behind.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.761
Some proof that...
That you were here.

33:18.029 --> 33:20.430
Who knows,
a hundred years from now,

33:20.432 --> 33:24.568
two people who we'll never know
could be sitting in this same
tree

33:24.570 --> 33:26.336
looking at our initials.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.338
And that's important why?

33:28.340 --> 33:31.541
Because then it's like
we're still here.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.311
There's a sweeter something

33:34.313 --> 33:39.783
And I will hold it
in my heart...

33:41.152 --> 33:42.719
So, what are you up to now?

33:42.987 --> 33:45.489
I'm meeting Rawly
for beers tonight.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.011
Can you believe I've gone
from wanting to beat him
senseless

33:49.027 --> 33:50.494
to letting him buy me a beer?

33:50.496 --> 33:53.130
No one said the path to killing
yourself
was gonna be easy.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.165
( chuckles )

33:55.167 --> 33:57.047
Thanks for being
my death muse.

34:04.442 --> 34:09.346
Oh, the joy of nothing...

34:09.348 --> 34:13.550
- Hey, Greta.
- Is a sweeter something

34:13.552 --> 34:17.487
- I'm sorry about your
grandmother.
- And I will hold it in my
heart...

34:17.489 --> 34:20.724
Try not to do anything
too interesting tonight, okay?

34:27.098 --> 34:29.433
Oh, shit, I gotta tell you
about this fucking...

34:29.435 --> 34:32.601
crazy dream I had last night.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.371
Me and you went to this
real fancy restaurant

34:35.373 --> 34:38.275
and the waiter came up
and it was your father.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.811
And he was, like,
telling us we had to leave,

34:41.079 --> 34:43.346
that they wouldn't serve us.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.614
So I got mad, right?
I was like, "That's bullshit."

34:45.617 --> 34:47.617
And I looked to you
and I'm like,

34:47.619 --> 34:49.820
"Tell him how fucked up
this shit is." Right?

34:52.623 --> 34:55.759
And when I look at you,
you're standing right behind
him.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.395
You're a waiter, too,
and you're telling me to leave.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.332
I couldn't believe it.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.105
Well, in my defense,
it's not because you're gay.

35:09.407 --> 35:12.242
It's because we just...
We just...

35:12.244 --> 35:13.643
We just don't serve niggers.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.712
( laughs )

35:15.714 --> 35:18.674
I knew you didn't like black
people.
You are so racist.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.352
You're not all black.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.321
- That's true.
- ( laughs )

35:26.257 --> 35:28.325
Come on.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.794
I'm an open heart

35:30.796 --> 35:33.597
It feels like we've come so
far...

35:33.599 --> 35:36.366
Just promise me
you'll talk to somebody.

35:38.603 --> 35:39.836
Anybody.

35:40.104 --> 35:42.439
- Show me your open heart...
- Okay.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.442
Till we fall in the love
that we started

35:45.444 --> 35:47.911
Show me your open heart

35:48.179 --> 35:51.681
Oh.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.317
( train horn blows in distance )

35:54.319 --> 35:55.886
Rawly: They just couldn't stop
the bleeding, you know?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.787
I'm sitting there thinking...

35:59.190 --> 36:01.658
"It was a sneeze.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.327
It was a fucking sneeze."

36:04.329 --> 36:06.763
Something inside her head
just blew.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.567
Just like that,
she was gone, you know?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.502
I don't know, fuck.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.272
( burps )
And then I had to go home.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.507
I had to tell Henry.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.277
And he's like, you know...
( groans )

36:20.279 --> 36:23.246
He's like, "Where's Mama?
Where's Mama? Where's my mama?"

36:25.149 --> 36:27.784
That's the saddest sneeze story
I've ever heard.

36:29.453 --> 36:29.452
How's your dad been
through all this?

36:29.454 --> 36:34.391
He's the biggest fucking asshole
to ever slip an arm through a
sleeve.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.628
He wouldn't close the store

36:38.630 --> 36:40.730
the day of her funeral.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.899
Jeez.

36:42.901 --> 36:46.269
He doesn't acknowledge his
grandson
because he has Down's syndrome.

36:47.471 --> 36:50.907
Who the fuck
could hate Henry?!

36:50.909 --> 36:52.576
Who?!

36:55.279 --> 36:57.480
Hey.

36:57.482 --> 37:00.350
I'm really sorry about the way
I treated you in school.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.319
If I were you,

37:02.321 --> 37:04.554
maybe a little bigger,
a little tougher,

37:04.556 --> 37:08.592
I'd want to kick my ass
for the shit I put you through.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.760
That fucking old man,
I swear to God,

37:10.762 --> 37:13.296
he made me his punching bag
since I could walk.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.299
I don't know...

37:16.301 --> 37:18.635
maybe I just needed
a punching bag, too.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.704
That doesn't make it right,

37:20.706 --> 37:22.939
but I am truly sorry.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.576
- Don't worry about it.
- ( sniffles )

37:27.778 --> 37:29.479
All right,
I want you to take that

37:29.481 --> 37:31.815
and I want you to smash me
in the head with it.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.318
You need to hurt me
like I hurt you.

37:38.522 --> 37:41.324
- I don't want to do that.
- I'm not gonna be able to sleep
tonight

37:41.326 --> 37:44.461
unless you bring the pain,
bitchpants.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.762
I can't!

37:45.764 --> 37:48.698
Do it!
Just do it!

37:48.700 --> 37:51.100
Do it, you fucking pussy,
or I swear to God I will make
you...

37:51.269 --> 37:52.802
- ( screams )
- ( laughter )

37:52.804 --> 37:56.006
God! Fuck me!
Come on!

37:56.274 --> 37:59.342
( screams )
Motherfuck-bucket!

37:59.344 --> 38:03.413
Last train a-running
between the water

38:03.415 --> 38:06.049
- With a power line...
- ( laughs ) Oh, fuck, yeah!

38:06.317 --> 38:09.953
Last train's a-running
around the hill...

38:09.955 --> 38:12.689
- You sure you're okay to drive?
- Oh, fuck, quit asking me that.

38:12.691 --> 38:16.393
I only live like six miles
from this fuckhole.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.995
- All right.
- Dude, so great seeing you.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.663
- You, too, buddy.
- Oh.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.465
- That was fun.
- Oh, my God.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.500
You're a good man, Ted.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.535
Hey...

38:25.537 --> 38:28.004
hey, can I ask, uh...
Can I ask you a favor?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.572
Yeah, sure.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.408
( sighs )

38:31.410 --> 38:34.411
Would you help me
kill my dad?

38:34.413 --> 38:36.046
Why not?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.415
- Yes!
- ( laughs )

38:38.417 --> 38:39.549
- All right.
- All right.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.052
- I'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

38:43.688 --> 38:47.891
You gotta be huffin' and puffin'
and chuggin' like a choo-choo
train

38:47.893 --> 38:49.993
Choo-choo

38:49.995 --> 38:53.930
A-huffin' and puffin' and
chuggin'
like a choo-choo train

38:53.932 --> 38:56.866
- Choo-choo...
- I'm awake. I'm awake.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.902
( police siren wailing )

38:58.904 --> 39:00.870
Choo-choo

39:00.872 --> 39:03.540
- A-huffin' and puffin'...
- Shit.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.909
I saw it was your
Monte Carlo, Chief,

39:05.911 --> 39:08.545
thought maybe you'd tied one on
and needed a lift.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.480
Lucky:
No, I let my kid brother use it.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.881
He's kind of going through
some shit.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.017
Well, just so you know,

39:14.019 --> 39:16.019
it was twice
the legal limit, so...

39:16.287 --> 39:18.988
Oh, yeah?
It was twice the legal limit,
huh?

39:18.990 --> 39:21.024
( both laugh )

39:21.292 --> 39:23.093
I could say the same thing
about your boobies.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.495
( scoffs, laughs )

39:25.497 --> 39:27.530
You should see 'em
underneath the shirt.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.032
( Lucky laughs )

39:29.034 --> 39:31.194
- See 'em out of uniform.
- I don't feel good.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.736
- What's the matter?
- I don't feel good.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.037
Yeah, well...

39:34.305 --> 39:36.773
hey, I'll see you
at lunch tomorrow, okay?

39:36.775 --> 39:39.442
- Hey, hey.
- I'd like to see you at lunch
tomorrow.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.364
- Yeah? That can be arranged.
- Oh.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.549
( groans )

39:48.552 --> 39:50.019
Oh, God.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.660
( groans )

40:03.801 --> 40:05.168
( knocks on door )

40:12.910 --> 40:14.611
You wanna talk?

40:19.950 --> 40:22.552
Ted:
Okay.

40:22.554 --> 40:25.555
Look at that one.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.857
These are...

40:27.859 --> 40:30.059
- really...
- Gay?

40:30.061 --> 40:33.530
Yeah. Yeah, they're...

40:33.532 --> 40:35.165
They're really gay.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.902
- So you're...
- I think so.

40:40.971 --> 40:42.138
You think so?

40:42.140 --> 40:44.507
( chuckles )
I mean, you know, I have a
boyfriend.

40:44.509 --> 40:47.110
- Oh.
- Yeah, I suck his dick.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.212
Oh, okay.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.115
Yeah, you're...
You're probably gay.

40:54.151 --> 40:57.020
What do you want me to do?
You want me to talk to your dad?

40:57.022 --> 40:59.088
Or are you just gonna tell
people
through cock drawings?

40:59.090 --> 41:00.623
( laughs )

41:02.493 --> 41:04.661
( sighs )
Um...

41:04.663 --> 41:06.930
no, my dad is...

41:08.165 --> 41:11.201
I think I'm just sitting with it
right now.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.802
You know?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.139
I think I just kinda needed
to tell somebody.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.540
Say it out loud.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.719
So, last month at school...

41:31.522 --> 41:34.224
I was walking down the corridor
with a couple buddies of mine

41:34.492 --> 41:36.192
after practice.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.895
Coming the other way
is, uh, Ralph Brooks, right?

41:38.897 --> 41:42.031
He's a skinny little blond kid.
He's...

41:42.033 --> 41:43.733
gay.

41:43.735 --> 41:46.169
Anyway, you know,
he's... he's walking towards us

41:46.437 --> 41:50.607
and... and me and him
make eye contact

41:50.609 --> 41:52.876
and he gives me this... this...

41:52.878 --> 41:55.979
Just like fucking
half smile thing, like...

41:58.749 --> 42:00.783
You know, like he knows...

42:00.785 --> 42:02.652
or something.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.888
Well, I panic.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.256
You know,
so when I passed by him,

42:06.524 --> 42:09.592
I mean, I just slammed
my shoulder into his chest.

42:11.495 --> 42:13.630
I mean,
I did it fucking hard.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.132
Wow.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.602
You know, he just... drops.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.642
He's just sitting there
and he's staring up at me.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.283
I've never hated anyone as much
as I hated him in that moment.

42:37.788 --> 42:39.656
( sighs )

42:39.658 --> 42:41.858
( crying )
I mean, I don't...

42:41.860 --> 42:44.093
I mean,
I don't wanna like guys.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.638
I don't want
to be hated like that.

42:59.610 --> 43:02.779
I don't know.
( sniffles )

43:08.719 --> 43:10.920
Man:
Here we go.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.956
Can I get you anything else?

43:12.958 --> 43:14.718
I think we're good.
Thanks.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.162
( laughs )

43:19.164 --> 43:22.231
( lisping )
I think somebody likes you.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.866
Don't be a dick.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.548
( normal voice )
Come on, that kid is gayer

43:25.636 --> 43:27.870
than a mouse shoved up
the ass of a gerbil

43:27.872 --> 43:30.340
shoved up the ass
of a sixth grade music teacher.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.743
- ( laughs )
- Why are you such an asshole?

43:33.745 --> 43:35.912
Relax, I'm joking.
Jesus.

43:35.914 --> 43:37.280
You're not funny.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.082
He didn't hear me.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.185
I'll tell you what.
I'll tickle his bag on the way
out.

43:42.187 --> 43:44.887
Make nice, okay?

43:44.889 --> 43:47.790
- Idiot.
- And people think I'm funny.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.292
Yeah, your wife
thinks you're a riot.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.360
What's that
supposed to mean?

43:52.262 --> 43:54.797
Fuck you. That woman
worships the ground I walk on.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.133
Why is she masturbating
in front of me, huh?

43:57.135 --> 43:58.334
I told you,
she's a sleep masturbator.

43:58.602 --> 44:01.304
- She's awake and you know it.
- Oh, yeah?

44:01.306 --> 44:03.773
She's pissed at you
and that's how she's getting you
back.

44:03.775 --> 44:05.942
The woman shit on your pillow,
for Christ's sake.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.377
She was asleep!
God damn it,

44:07.645 --> 44:10.913
she was dreaming about the time
her cat had kittens.

44:10.915 --> 44:13.035
Is she asleep
when she spits in your coffee?

44:15.352 --> 44:17.253
I've seen it, Luck.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.328
I got this.

44:27.931 --> 44:29.399
Oh, and, uh,
you're welcome

44:29.667 --> 44:31.934
for the free room, board,
and transportation, too.

44:31.936 --> 44:33.403
Asshole.

44:39.243 --> 44:41.944
Vickie:
After the birth of Margie, my
third,

44:41.946 --> 44:45.148
I was back in a size four
a month later.

44:45.150 --> 44:48.051
I was always thin.
I could always bounce right
back.

44:48.053 --> 44:51.120
You remember how my parents
owned that Laundromat, right?

44:51.122 --> 44:53.756
- Yeah, the Fluff and Fold.
- ( chuckles )

44:53.758 --> 44:55.758
God, I hated that place.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.028
Every day we would
just have to wade through

44:59.030 --> 45:01.230
a mountain of other people's
dirty laundry.

45:01.232 --> 45:05.001
I just thought,
"I will never be like my
parents."

45:05.003 --> 45:08.104
I mean, how can they spend
their lives washing and folding

45:08.106 --> 45:10.306
other people's sweat and stains?

45:12.109 --> 45:14.811
Then one day
I was in my cellar

45:14.813 --> 45:19.482
washing my fourth, fifth, sixth,
load of dirty clothes

45:19.750 --> 45:21.984
while I folded another
from the dryer

45:21.986 --> 45:24.454
when I heard the cellar door
open

45:24.722 --> 45:27.857
and a whole new pile
was tossed down.

45:27.859 --> 45:29.959
And I thought...

45:33.230 --> 45:34.997
"Oh, my God."

45:34.999 --> 45:36.866
Let's do a shot.

45:36.868 --> 45:39.102
( laughs )

45:39.104 --> 45:40.803
- That sounds great.
- Yeah.

45:40.805 --> 45:43.506
Greta on video:
Okay, so be honest.

45:43.774 --> 45:46.876
You're actually kinda happy
that my grandmother's dead,
aren't you?

45:46.878 --> 45:50.246
- No.
- Come on, don't lie.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.281
I'm not lying.

45:52.283 --> 45:54.517
Not long from now,
when I'm in the afterlife,

45:54.785 --> 45:57.353
I'm gonna bump into Mrs.
Lawrence
and it's gonna be all awkward

45:57.355 --> 46:01.190
and I'm gonna be like,
"Hey, Mrs. Lawrence, how are
you?"

46:01.192 --> 46:03.259
And she's gonna be
all like fake nice to me

46:03.261 --> 46:05.328
'cause, you know,
in heaven you gotta be polite.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.897
( Greta laughs on video )

46:07.899 --> 46:09.532
Greta on video: You know what?
You're really kinda funny.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.868
Thanks.

46:13.237 --> 46:17.306
Greta on video:
So... why do you think

46:17.308 --> 46:19.942
you wanna kill yourself?

46:24.081 --> 46:27.016
I just got tired of trying
to find reasons not to.

46:29.419 --> 46:33.055
- ( camcorder beeps )
- ( sighs )

46:33.057 --> 46:34.991
Do you know that
I fell in love with you

46:34.993 --> 46:36.359
in fourth grade?

46:36.361 --> 46:39.362
Geography class.
You sat right in front of me.

46:39.364 --> 46:41.464
I couldn't take
my eyes off you.

46:41.466 --> 46:45.168
You were so pretty and kind.

46:45.170 --> 46:48.104
- You knew all your continents.
- ( laughs )

46:48.106 --> 46:50.373
Did you really think
I was kind?

46:50.375 --> 46:53.142
I don't feel kind.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.377
What do you feel like?

46:54.379 --> 46:57.013
Like a cautionary tale.

46:57.015 --> 47:00.383
I did what was safe,
what was expected.

47:00.385 --> 47:02.151
I love my kids, but...

47:02.153 --> 47:03.352
I bet you're a great mom.

47:03.354 --> 47:05.488
I don't wanna be
just a great mom.

47:05.490 --> 47:09.592
I want to matter and not just
as a mom to my kids and Albert,

47:09.860 --> 47:12.395
but to me.

47:12.397 --> 47:13.996
I wanna matter to me.

47:13.998 --> 47:17.200
You matter.
You matter to me.

47:19.803 --> 47:23.239
There's no reset button,
is there, Teddy?

47:23.241 --> 47:25.174
You don't need one.

47:25.176 --> 47:30.379
You're the sweetest,
most gentle person I've ever
known.

47:30.381 --> 47:32.081
I've always wondered
how differently my life

47:32.083 --> 47:34.123
would have turned out
if I was with you.

47:37.354 --> 47:40.356
You know, I remember

47:40.358 --> 47:43.426
you used to eat an apple
every day for lunch.

47:43.428 --> 47:45.328
They're God's toothbrush.

47:45.330 --> 47:48.197
You always wore
7UP Lip Smacker.

47:48.199 --> 47:50.032
To this day,
that's my favorite soda.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.301
Your book report
on reptiles and amphibians

47:52.303 --> 47:55.438
in the sixth grade was...
incredible.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.306
I got a B.

47:57.308 --> 47:59.175
Oh, that's fucking bullshit.

47:59.177 --> 48:01.577
Love all day, baby

48:01.579 --> 48:05.181
No need to decide

48:05.183 --> 48:07.950
Well, should I live a lie

48:07.952 --> 48:10.453
So I can find...

48:10.455 --> 48:13.289
I'll meet you at the Willow.
It's up a block.

48:13.291 --> 48:14.590
You sure you want to do this?

48:14.858 --> 48:16.559
Ted, if you're looking
for absolution,

48:16.827 --> 48:18.667
I don't think either one of us
is getting that.

48:18.929 --> 48:21.597
So we either have sex
and live with it,

48:21.865 --> 48:23.299
or we don't.

48:24.434 --> 48:26.302
Okay, I'll see you there.

48:26.304 --> 48:29.639
Well, it might just blind you

48:29.907 --> 48:33.175
Before light, baby

48:33.177 --> 48:38.581
It might just blind you

48:38.583 --> 48:42.018
Before

48:42.020 --> 48:47.323
Light, babe.

48:55.132 --> 48:58.000
Hey, man.
See you tonight.

48:58.002 --> 49:00.703
10:00 PM.
Huh? Huh?

49:00.971 --> 49:02.939
( laughing )
Yeah.

49:04.541 --> 49:07.109
( sighs )
Oh, my God.

49:07.111 --> 49:10.079
( imitating Elvis )
I love the sun

49:10.081 --> 49:11.614
I love the moon

49:11.882 --> 49:14.650
I love the way
you make me swoon...

49:14.652 --> 49:16.585
( humming )

49:19.656 --> 49:22.591
( Nancy laughs )
Look there.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.660
- Hmm?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, here.

49:24.662 --> 49:28.397
There's the two of you off
on one of your Wammy
expeditions.

49:28.399 --> 49:29.632
( both chuckle )

49:29.900 --> 49:32.268
Ted: Probably made
a thousand trips out on that
lake.

49:32.270 --> 49:35.237
- Uh-huh.
- All boils down to 37 photos

49:35.239 --> 49:38.741
of a spare tire, schools of
fish,
and a drowned muskrat.

49:39.009 --> 49:41.110
Well, I beg to differ with you.

49:41.112 --> 49:43.512
You have way much more
than that.

49:43.514 --> 49:46.682
You have
countless hours together.

49:46.684 --> 49:48.517
Just the two of you.

49:48.519 --> 49:51.687
Talking and sharing
and searching.

49:51.689 --> 49:52.755
( laughs )

49:53.023 --> 49:54.590
Searching for what?

49:54.592 --> 49:58.294
We could have done the same
thing
playing catch in our backyard.

49:58.296 --> 50:03.566
Your father wanted to have
an adventure with you boys.

50:03.568 --> 50:08.437
You have made
my life complete

50:08.439 --> 50:10.406
- Never...
- Shirley.

50:10.408 --> 50:12.575
I'm sorry, baby. Sorry.
Excuse me, baby. Excuse me.

50:12.577 --> 50:14.276
- Nancy: Thanks.
- Sorry, Ted.

50:14.278 --> 50:16.278
- Sounds good.
- Thank you, baby.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.447
Thank you very much.

50:18.449 --> 50:21.083
As soon as you could talk,

50:21.085 --> 50:24.086
you were obsessed
with Wammy.

50:24.088 --> 50:26.522
You had the lunchbox,
you had the T-shirt,

50:26.524 --> 50:28.257
you had the little cap,
you had everything.

50:28.259 --> 50:31.360
If it said "Wammy,"
you had it.

50:31.362 --> 50:34.330
And your father thought

50:34.332 --> 50:36.432
it would be so fun

50:36.434 --> 50:39.602
for just the two of you
to go find him.

50:39.604 --> 50:42.638
I thought Dad
was the one who started it all.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.608
He knew everything about Wammy.
He was a Wammy encyclopedia.

50:45.610 --> 50:49.178
He was a Teddy encyclopedia.

50:49.180 --> 50:53.516
Searching for Wammy
was your father's gift to you...

50:53.518 --> 50:55.484
because you were so practical.

50:55.486 --> 51:01.257
And he knew
that you needed wonder.

51:14.538 --> 51:16.505
Ted: Rawly, are you sure
about this?

51:16.507 --> 51:18.374
I mean,
I know he's a dick, but...

51:18.376 --> 51:20.409
But what?

51:20.411 --> 51:23.245
That miserable bastard
ruined my life.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.781
He treated me like shit
since I could stand.

51:26.049 --> 51:27.817
He was cruel to my dead wife,

51:28.085 --> 51:30.386
he treats Henry
like a stray fucking cat, man.

51:30.388 --> 51:32.855
Fuck him!
I'm going up there.

51:33.123 --> 51:35.524
I'm gonna strangle his ass
with my bare hands.

51:35.526 --> 51:38.661
I'll be the last thing
his bulging eyes see

51:38.663 --> 51:42.364
before he takes his long trip
to the dark recesses of hell.

51:44.267 --> 51:47.169
Okay, sounds like
you've given this some thought.

51:47.171 --> 51:48.604
Come on.

51:52.776 --> 51:55.277
All right,
you rotten son of a bitch.

51:55.279 --> 51:56.745
It's payback time.

52:06.423 --> 52:07.890
Shit!

52:08.158 --> 52:09.558
- Dad?
- ( groaning )

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
Daddy?
Hey, Dad!

52:11.562 --> 52:11.560
- ( gasping )
- Oh, fuck, he's having a heart
attack!

52:11.562 --> 52:15.531
Shit! Don't just stand there,
Ted!
Call 9-1-1, man!

52:15.533 --> 52:17.666
I-I thought you were here
to kill him, remember?

52:17.668 --> 52:19.435
He was the asshole
who ruined your life,

52:19.437 --> 52:21.203
he's mean to your wife,
called Henry

52:21.205 --> 52:23.239
- the "Little Engine That
Couldn't."
- Ted, what the fuck, man?!

52:23.241 --> 52:24.673
You're being really insensitive
right now!

52:24.675 --> 52:26.442
Fucking do something!
He's having a heart attack,

52:26.444 --> 52:28.210
for Christ's sake!
Help me! Help me!

52:28.212 --> 52:29.778
- God damn it!
- What's happening?

52:29.780 --> 52:31.580
Daddy! Dad?

52:48.765 --> 52:50.266
( doorbell rings )

52:50.268 --> 52:51.600
I got it.

52:52.869 --> 52:54.470
Thank you.

53:09.753 --> 53:10.953
Vickie?

53:12.255 --> 53:15.858
What... what are you
doing here?

53:16.126 --> 53:18.394
The other night made me think.

53:18.396 --> 53:20.863
I've lived my whole life
for other people.

53:21.131 --> 53:23.399
For what?

53:23.401 --> 53:25.634
We've been in love with each
other
since the fourth grade.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.369
You said so yourself.

53:27.371 --> 53:29.505
What?

53:29.507 --> 53:32.541
I don't want
to fight it anymore.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.910
I want to give us
the chance we never had.

53:37.781 --> 53:41.517
But you have kids
and a husband.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.520
I had them the other night, too,
when you took me from behind.

53:44.522 --> 53:45.688
( gasps )
They had sex!

53:45.690 --> 53:48.424
I can see it. Set me on fire.
Start with my eyes.

53:48.426 --> 53:49.925
Get out!

53:52.896 --> 53:55.431
Look, Vickie,
that night was wonderful.

53:55.433 --> 53:57.800
It was the best.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.835
I never orgasm like that orally.

53:59.837 --> 54:02.404
I'm still alive.
Mercy killing.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.707
- ( Lucky groans )
- ( sighs ) I just...

54:04.709 --> 54:08.377
I think we should
slow down a bit, you know?

54:08.379 --> 54:10.479
- Discuss...
- Man: Vickie!

54:10.481 --> 54:12.581
- Vickie!
- Albert.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.416
He must have found my note.

54:14.418 --> 54:17.553
- Albert: Don't get upset!
- You wrote a note?

54:17.555 --> 54:20.022
- Slow down! Come on, get in
here.
- ( children crying )

54:20.290 --> 54:22.424
- Vickie!
- Lucky: Who the hell is this?

54:22.426 --> 54:24.860
Albert: Come home.
I need you.

54:24.862 --> 54:26.729
The kids need you.

54:26.731 --> 54:28.831
Jake hasn't stopped crying.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.966
I can't get him to eat.

54:30.968 --> 54:33.702
I wrote this...

54:33.704 --> 54:35.638
after our LuLu was born.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.973
Is he gonna read a poem?

54:37.975 --> 54:40.709
"I was alone.

54:40.711 --> 54:42.411
Dinner alone.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.446
Television alone.

54:44.448 --> 54:45.581
Work alone.

54:45.583 --> 54:48.350
Live alone.

54:48.352 --> 54:50.753
Sleep alone.

54:50.755 --> 54:54.456
I thought that was good,
being alone.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.625
Then I met you.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.527
Then we had kids,

54:58.529 --> 55:01.397
and I realized
how sad I was alone."

55:01.399 --> 55:05.401
I mean, I'm no expert,
but shouldn't that rhyme?

55:05.403 --> 55:07.936
- ( crying )
- Okay, shh, shh, shh.

55:07.938 --> 55:11.018
- I didn't mean... yeah.
- Kathleen: It's okay. Shh, shh,
shh.

55:11.241 --> 55:13.008
You go... there.

55:13.010 --> 55:15.678
I think Jake's allergic
to fish sticks.

55:15.680 --> 55:16.979
( children shouting )

55:16.981 --> 55:19.615
It's all I can cook him
and he keeps throwing up.

55:19.617 --> 55:22.885
You got 300 pounds of mother of
five
blubbering at my table.

55:22.887 --> 55:26.388
You gotta kick that one
back into the ocean, tout de
suite.

55:26.390 --> 55:28.624
- Would you skip the fat jokes?
- Okay.

55:28.626 --> 55:31.026
But you and a whole lotta lovin'
gotta figure this out.

55:31.028 --> 55:33.996
( laughs )
I'm sorry. Sorry, last one.

55:33.998 --> 55:37.733
Uh-oh! Your hair's on fire!
Gotta get that.

55:37.735 --> 55:39.835
Hey!
Come here!

55:41.705 --> 55:43.372
Hey, Romeo.

55:46.042 --> 55:49.044
Don't be fucking rude, dude.
Look at me when I talk to you.

55:49.046 --> 55:51.380
There just ain't much
to look at, man, that's all.

55:55.285 --> 55:58.921
Aha, look out, Zeke.
I think he's got the hots for
you.

55:58.923 --> 56:01.523
Fuck off, guys.
Can we go to class, please?

56:01.525 --> 56:04.660
Yeah, I'm done
with this guy anyway.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.931
Oh, uh, hey, Mr. James.

56:08.933 --> 56:10.699
Come on.
Guys, let's go.

56:12.635 --> 56:14.903
- What's up, Mr. James?
- Everything okay, Romeo?

56:14.905 --> 56:17.473
- ( school bell ringing )
- Amazing.

56:23.413 --> 56:25.881
- Tall cappuccino.
- Thank you.

56:31.521 --> 56:33.088
Hey, you Ted?

56:33.356 --> 56:34.857
Yeah.

56:34.859 --> 56:36.725
- I'm Zeke's friend.
- Oh.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.627
Do you go to school together?

56:41.431 --> 56:44.500
We do a lot of things together.

56:44.502 --> 56:47.102
Oh, okay.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.873
I love him,
I just can't live like this.

56:50.875 --> 56:53.976
You know, I'm fine being a
secret,
I'm used to that, but I'm...

56:55.111 --> 56:57.613
I'm not okay with being
less than a secret.

56:57.615 --> 57:01.750
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what it is you want me to do.

57:01.752 --> 57:04.052
Just be there for him.

57:04.054 --> 57:06.922
You're the only one that knows
he's gay besides me and...

57:10.460 --> 57:12.928
I'm breaking up with him
and he's gonna act like he
doesn't care,

57:12.930 --> 57:14.730
but he will.

57:14.732 --> 57:17.666
And eventually it has to come
out,
even if he can't.

57:20.470 --> 57:22.430
I don't know,
just be there for him.

57:25.608 --> 57:27.676
( music playing )

57:33.650 --> 57:36.685
This is all right,
this is all right

57:36.687 --> 57:39.087
This is all right

57:41.491 --> 57:44.526
This is all right,
this is all right

57:44.528 --> 57:45.994
This is all right...

57:45.996 --> 57:48.130
I never wanted you
to leave your family.

57:49.599 --> 57:51.700
You should open with that
next time.

57:53.069 --> 57:56.071
Us big women with five kids,

57:56.073 --> 57:58.240
kindness is like...

57:58.508 --> 58:00.209
a dinner bell.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.578
We'll always answer.

58:04.781 --> 58:09.618
Funny thing,
another day... who knows.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.087
I might not have, but...

58:12.089 --> 58:14.089
that's the thing about days...

58:15.758 --> 58:17.993
they have a mind of their own.

58:19.696 --> 58:21.597
I'm so sorry.

58:23.566 --> 58:25.033
I know you are.

58:26.736 --> 58:28.670
Now...

58:28.672 --> 58:30.772
go fuck yourself.

58:35.545 --> 58:36.979
Yeah.

58:36.981 --> 58:41.583
It's not a last call, but

58:43.152 --> 58:44.820
Ooh

58:44.822 --> 58:49.091
It's time to go home...

58:49.093 --> 58:51.159
( whistling )

58:52.896 --> 58:58.166
I wear your heart
on my sleeve

59:00.003 --> 59:04.740
I wear your heart
on my sleeve

59:07.777 --> 59:12.548
You wear your heart
on my sleeve

59:15.718 --> 59:19.955
I wear your heart
on my sleeve...

59:32.135 --> 59:34.303
( groans )
Oh, man.

59:36.139 --> 59:38.073
( Kathleen moaning )

59:39.609 --> 59:44.713
We're not the end
of every sentence...

59:44.715 --> 59:47.082
I know you're awake, Kathleen.

59:48.985 --> 59:51.186
I know you spit
in my coffee, too.

59:55.158 --> 59:59.728
It's not a last call, but

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:06.969
It's time to go home

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:14.843
You wear your heart
on my sleeve

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:22.618
I wear your heart
on my sleeve

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.323
We are not the end

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:32.294
But it's almost gone

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:36.031
Not all we are

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:39.935
It's not all you are

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:45.207
We can't wait so long,
but we waited for...

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:46.808
You must be Ted.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.345
Yeah, I'm Ted.

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:56.852
What, you don't want her
anymore?

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:59.321
It was never my intention
to take her.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.125
Well, what was your intention?

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:06.228
Vickie's a big girl,
she's got five kids.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.864
I know what I see in her, but...

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:10.966
you, I don't have a clue.

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.403
It doesn't matter.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.972
We made a mistake.
She wants to come back.

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:19.808
What a set of balls you have.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.378
You blow a family apart
and say it doesn't matter?

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.180
No, I don't mean it like that.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:31.253
My life is really complicated
right now.

01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:32.854
( scoffs )
No shit.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.857
You just inherited
a single mom with five kids.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.161
Albert, I'm...

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:40.996
I'm leaving.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.065
I'm never coming back, ever.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.803
It's your call.

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:54.376
You're not gonna tell me
why you did it?

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:55.977
Does it matter?

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:02.084
Yeah, it matters,
'cause everything fucking
matters.

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.189
I don't know.

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:11.093
- Memories?
- Memories. ( scoffs )

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.932
Memories are like a magpie.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.034
It picks up all the...

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:22.471
bright and shiny shit and pays
no attention to what really
matters.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.175
Tell her I'll think about it.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:45.026
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.531
Man:
Our condolences.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:54.870
- Mrs. Phillips?
- Ted Morgan?

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:57.592
- Oh, my.
- I can't believe you remember
me.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.342
Oh, of course I do.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:03.411
I had you and Lucky.
Eighth grade geography.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.913
That's right.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:07.215
I always liked you better.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:09.417
Lucky gave me
a ticket last year.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.553
He said it was
for being too cute.

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:14.556
Aren't you nice to come
and say goodbye to Edwina

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:17.492
after she treated you
so horribly?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.328
Yeah, I could never really
figure that out.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.297
I guess I just had
one of those faces.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:25.500
No, you had her son's face.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.937
He left right after
Greta was born.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.505
Broke her heart.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:34.009
And I guess she was
taking that broken heart out on
you.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:36.478
Oh, she's such a tragic girl.

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:39.981
Growing up without a father
and that thing with her mother.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:43.118
Yeah, I know. Cancer.
It's an awful way to go.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.521
No, her mother
didn't die of cancer.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.490
She took her own life.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:52.194
Poor little thing,
she was only seven.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:57.265
Hmm.

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.940
Hey, you.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.218
You all right?

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.354
People leave.
It's okay.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.626
Wake's over.
Let's go.

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:27.495
But I know you can

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:34.302
Swallow it whole...

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.538
Ted:
Can I ask you a question?

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.340
Fire away.

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:42.510
Why don't you
have a boyfriend?

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.145
You're really pretty.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:47.582
You're totally crazy,
but really pretty.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:50.585
When you feel your soul...

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.988
I know your mom
didn't die of cancer.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:59.361
Let it be this way
till the end of time...

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:02.497
I'm sorry for lying.

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:05.100
You must think that I'm...

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:07.602
like some kind
of crazy person.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:09.371
I understand.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:11.172
You do?

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.508
You know,
it's not your fault.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.178
You didn't deserve that.

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:25.253
I wanna move less
over time...

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:30.125
Greta...

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:32.160
I'm sorry.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.330
I can't.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.167
I'm not gonna be here.

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.070
Greta.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.606
Come... come on.
Come on, don't do this.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:48.076
Why are you acting
like you care about me?

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:50.145
I do care.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:52.113
I care so much.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.549
I just...

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:58.553
- I'm done.
- You're a hypocrite.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.722
I actually felt bad for you.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.725
I thought you were just
some lonely guy.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:08.596
Like I am and you didn't
understand
that that's all it was, but...

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:12.634
you have people
who care about you!

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.670
You're not lonely,
you're empty!

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.572
And that's worse!

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:21.076
On fire, baby

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:24.446
When you know
I want to make you feel

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.047
For me, babe

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:28.516
Feel for me, baby...

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:29.651
( car door closes )

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.288
You guys wanna hit the lake?

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.690
It's hot as shit.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:38.660
Then we gotta get in the car
and drive.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.462
It's too much of an effort.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.231
What's the matter, Pete?

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.433
- Heavy flow day?
- ( boys snicker )

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:45.433
Fuck off.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:49.471
I just want my entertainment
to involve a little less effort.

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:52.640
Cheerleaders:
Defense! Defense! Defense!

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:56.244
Pete:
Ask and you shall receive.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.013
Who's up for a little fun?

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.552
Easy, Romeo.

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:05.787
Your clothes are gonna be
waiting for you

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:08.089
on the roof of the school.

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:09.524
Oh, yeah,
and all you gotta do

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.292
is walk across the school
bare-ass,

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:13.695
climb up side the ladder
and get 'em.

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.697
You're taking off my fucking
clothes
and I'm the one that's gay?

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:17.098
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.166
( grunts )

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.772
Come on, dude,
get over here!

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.673
He's as strong as 10 queers

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:27.509
or one really strong
11-year-old girl.

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:28.777
Zeke!

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.478
What the fuck you asking
his help for, man?

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.747
Quit being such a fucking pussy
and get over here.

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:33.014
Romeo:
Zeke, please, man!

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:36.818
Please? What the fuck is going
on?
Why does he keep asking for you?

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:49.330
'Cause this faggot's been after
my ass
since fucking freshman year.

01:07:49.332 --> 01:07:51.166
Come on, Zeke,
don't do that.

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:53.468
- Stop saying my fucking name!
- Whoa!

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.736
Hey!

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:57.238
( grunting )

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.506
Dude, that's enough.
That's enough!

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:01.810
Get the fuck off me!
Motherfuck!

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.778
Stop it! Stop!

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.413
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:17.125
( police radio chatter )

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:20.495
( crying )

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:25.466
- Ah!
- We're gonna find your son,
ma'am.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.308
- What's going on?
- Do you know where Zeke is?

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.410
Zeke? No, why?

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:38.212
He beat the shit out of some
black kid
at school for no reason.

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:40.548
Then he steals his friend's car
and we can't find him anywhere.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.783
Romeo?

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:45.752
Yeah, Romeo Simple.
How do you know his name?

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:49.823
Romeo is Zeke's boyfriend.

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:52.760
( scoffs )
What?

01:08:55.096 --> 01:08:57.465
Are you saying
my Zeke and this...

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.234
He told me.

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:00.835
He has...

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:03.805
drawings of penises in a bowl.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:07.375
- Don't!
- Don't you talk about my son!

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:13.781
( grunts )

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:15.750
Whoa, whoa!
Everybody stand back.

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:17.519
This is a family matter.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.921
Oh, that's a nice shot,
little brother.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.109
Hit a man
when his back is turned.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.725
I bet you can't do that
when I'm facing you.

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:30.698
- ( grunting )
- ( screaming )

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:37.538
Oh, look, look!
Here's a bowl of dicks for you
to draw!

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.872
Here, take it.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.742
Yeah, eat it!

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.310
Suck it!

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:47.749
Huh? Huh?

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.551
Get off me, you dumb shit!

01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:50.852
You don't call,
you don't write,

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.720
and your bitch-ass leaves
and all of a sudden it's,

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.956
"Hey, big brother,
can I come stay at your house

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.591
while I fuck some fatties?"

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:57.825
Huh?!

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.428
( laughing )

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.797
You're tickling me.
Stop tickling.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:06.334
Maybe I'd come back more
if you weren't such an asshole.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.869
Ah! Fuck!

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:09.637
You're both assholes.

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.274
Teddy's right.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:18.780
It was a year ago, it was late.
I saw Zeke kiss a boy.

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:20.715
He was black.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.164
( crying )
I'm afraid he might hurt
himself.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:27.422
This is such bullshit!

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:29.324
I think I know how to find him.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:38.666
- Excuse me, Romeo?
- It's okay, Mama.

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:40.301
I don't care who his brother is.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:41.636
I'm gonna ground
that son of a bitch

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:44.606
till there ain't nothing left of
him
but teeth and eyeballs.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:48.876
I'm Ted Morgan.
This is my sister-in-law,
Kathleen.

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:50.745
Are you okay?

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.947
A fractured jaw, a busted lip,

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.816
and he's laying up here
in a hospital bed.

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.017
Oh, he's dandy.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:59.487
I'm so sorry.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:00.969
Don't worry,
I'm not pressing charges,

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:02.557
so, please, just go.

01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:04.559
Romeo, Zeke is missing.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.728
He stole a car.
Nobody can find him.

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.496
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:11.566
- Mama, get my pants.
- You're not getting out of that
bed.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.868
- Mama, get my pants!
- Mm-mm, did you hear what I
said?

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:14.936
Mama, you're more
than welcome to come.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:14.936
You can do your whole
"Color Purple" thing on the ride
there,

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:18.573
- but I'm going.
- You know how I feel

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:20.508
- about "The Color Purple."
- I'm going!

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:22.844
I think I know where he is.

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:25.713
- Get my pants, Mama.
- I'm getting 'em.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.418
What?

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:37.925
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he did it.

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.629
No.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:44.465
No, no.
He went through with it.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.401
Did he do it?
Did he do it?

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.802
Sorry, ma'am,
you gotta stay back.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:49.671
He did it, didn't he?
He killed himself.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:51.806
We don't know that, ma'am.
We're trying to locate him.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:55.576
- Why do you think he killed
himself?
- Because he told me he was
going to.

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:58.012
- Zeke told you this? When?
- Zeke? No, Ted!

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.049
Ted told me that he was going
to commit suicide.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.984
Chief, they found the car.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.053
Zeke's not there, though.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.455
- Show me.
- Let's go!

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:08.690
Wha...

01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:10.625
Romeo:
It's right up here.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:12.760
Mother: Ooh, child,
I ain't got on the right shoes.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.595
This is a mess out here.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:17.465
Why would y'all be
in all of this mess?

01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:18.766
How'd you know
he'd come here?

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:20.935
It's his favorite place.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:24.038
He likes to come here
when he wants to be alone.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.840
It's called "World's End."

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.042
He said it's the most beautiful
place ever.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:29.644
You just gotta believe
in the Lord

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:32.547
and know that everything's
gonna turn out right.

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.615
Do you think that God
hates homosexuals?

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:38.019
Not my God.
My God loves everybody.

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.621
Yeah? What if you get to heaven
and you find out He doesn't?

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:41.856
Then I'm in the wrong place,

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.925
'cause if He don't want my son,
He don't want me.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:46.928
And I will give Him what for
and skip off down to hell.

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:50.631
Be nice to see
my daddy again anyway.

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:52.934
Hang on a minute!

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:55.136
- Zeke!
- Don't... don't... don't... don't!

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.605
Stay back!

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.167
Kathleen:
Zeke...

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.076
Romeo.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.914
I'm so sorry.
You okay?

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:08.950
Now that's up to you.

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:17.024
I can't... I can't be queer.

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:22.096
- I'm sorry.
- Kathleen: It's okay, Zeke.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.132
We love you.
We don't care that you're gay.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.967
Dad does.

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:29.070
Okay?
My friends do.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:32.840
I do.

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:35.810
I've been where you are, Zeke.

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.180
I am where you are.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:40.982
You're gay, too?

01:13:40.984 --> 01:13:43.117
No. No.

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:44.719
I...

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:50.591
I came here to do exactly what
you're thinking of doing right
now.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.927
I'm 41 years old,
I manage a pet store,

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.830
no wife, no kids.

01:13:55.832 --> 01:13:58.166
- No anything.
- That's not the same.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:13:59.967
Zeke!

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.670
You're right,
it's not the same.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.138
You know who you are,

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:05.873
you just can't get
your head around it yet.

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:09.010
Me?
I don't have a clue.

01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:11.746
- Fucking jump.
- What?

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:13.147
Romeo:
Go ahead.

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:15.817
Go ahead, fag, just jump.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:19.086
I've never met two whinier
bitches
in my entire life.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:22.223
"I manage a pet store."
"I'm queer."

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:25.626
Who fucking cares?

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.228
I'm black, I'm gay.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.131
My mom's got
a fucking drinking problem.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.099
Had. Had a drinking problem.

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:33.768
I've been sober for two months.

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:36.037
I got my chip here somewhere.

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.772
I haven't seen my dad
since I was eight,

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:39.907
and my fucking name
is Romeo.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.944
And I'm still more grateful
than y'all bitches.

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:45.847
You're gay, Zeke.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.648
And I love you.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.084
I love you.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:51.986
So choosing a life of love

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.255
from the people
that actually fucking matter

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:58.493
and be an artist
because you're actually
talented...

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.929
If that's unbearable to you,
then you should jump.

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:03.798
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.
- Jump.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.099
Lucky:
All right. Okay, okay.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:08.035
Enough trying to convince
two people to kill themselves.

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:11.806
Zeke, it's your dad.

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:15.209
- I'm gay, Dad, not blind.
- Right.

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:18.179
You're my son and I love you.

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:23.951
I admit I'm not too crazy
about you liking men's penises,

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.920
but it's not a deal breaker.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:29.690
Just 'cause I don't need
a drawing of a bowl full of 'em

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:30.992
hanging on my office wall...

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:33.027
Luck, stay on track.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.196
Right.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:38.132
- ( Kathleen screams )
- Oh, no, no, no, son, don't,
please.

01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:39.967
Please.

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:42.837
I can't live like this, Dad.

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:49.110
Do you know how I got
my nickname?

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:50.778
What?

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.914
My nickname, Lucky.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:54.315
You know how I got it?

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:54.582
From... what are you talking
about?

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:58.319
From... from the miraculous catch
you made playing high school
football?

01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.720
What are you talking about?

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:02.323
That's what I told you,
but that's not...

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.025
That's not why.

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:06.127
I got it 'cause I'm unlucky.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:08.029
I had no luck at all.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.331
Unlucky was just too long.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:13.100
We were learning about irony
in English class

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:14.869
and some smart-ass
shortened it.

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:17.004
We lost that game

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:19.740
'cause I fumbled
a couple of plays later.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:23.277
Yeah. But, you know,
later when I got on the force

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:26.347
and I met your mother
and we had you and your brother,

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.749
I started to think that maybe...

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.351
my name wasn't so ironic.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.720
What's your point?

01:16:32.722 --> 01:16:35.156
When I was your age,
some shit happened to me, too.

01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:36.657
Happens to all of us.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.960
Doesn't mean you say "fuck it"
and kill yourself.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.228
'Cause tomorrow's
totally different.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:43.864
Shit's temporary, son.

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:47.768
I know I might not be
the easiest guy in the world to
talk to.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.038
I'm not a monster.
I still love you.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.107
( crying )

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.179
I love this asshole.
I love all of you.

01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:00.881
Zeke.

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:03.017
I'm sorry.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:05.786
I know I haven't been
a very good mother.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:09.090
I saw things,
I-I knew things,

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:11.859
I just...
I don't know why I...

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:13.861
You're a great mother,
Kathleen!

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:16.330
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:17.999
And you're a good wife.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:25.339
You can get through this, Zeke.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:28.075
You have family
and friends that love you.

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:29.410
Come on,
let's get you home.

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:34.281
- Come on, honey.
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:36.150
- God, Zeke!
- Mom!

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.318
- ( all scream )
- Shit!

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.020
- Ted: Zeke!
- Lucky: Zeke!

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:41.122
Kathleen:
Oh, my God!

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:46.060
- Lucky: Ted!
- Greta: Ted!

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:48.763
( Lucky screams )

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.102
( gasps )

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:58.105
Hey!
I got ya!

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.241
Hold on to me!

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:01.375
Where's Ted?

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.844
- Where's Uncle Ted?
- Ted! Ted!

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.247
Teddy! Teddy!

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:24.231
( man laughing )

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:26.100
Pretty cool, huh?

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.940
- ( chuckles )
- Dad?

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:34.175
Hi, Teddy.

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:41.148
- Am I dead?
- No, no, no, you're...

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.451
Your brain is being deprived
of oxygen.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:47.021
So I'm about to die,
I just haven't done it yet?

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:49.957
Depends.
Is that what you want?

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:55.196
I guess

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:56.897
death seems...

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:58.232
I don't know...

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.934
easier.

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:03.037
Not gonna lie to you,
death's got its perks,

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:04.905
but nothing beats livin'.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:06.907
Nothin'.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.977
- Can I stay with you?
- No, not yet.

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.445
Someday.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:14.915
I'm afraid all the time, Daddy.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.285
I know, but the trick
to beatin' fear...

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:21.922
is to live a life so full
there's no room for it.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.391
Fear thrives in emptiness, son.

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:27.027
So just fill 'er up, Teddy.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:28.462
I know you can do it.

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.300
Bye, Teddy bear.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:03.397
( roars )

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:39.500
- Is my baby brother okay?
- All right, just stand back,
Chief.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:42.503
Zeke.

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:45.573
- There's no pulse.
- Ah, come on, Ted!

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:49.210
Oh, you took my daddy,
you can't take my little
brother, too.

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:50.477
Ted.

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:53.347
Oh, God.
Can you hear me? Ted?

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:56.617
No, you can't leave.
You cannot leave.

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:01.355
I'm so sorry
that I got angry at you before.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.490
I'm sorry
that I said those things.

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:05.226
The real reason
that I don't have a boyfriend

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:07.995
is that I don't...
I don't trust anyone to stick
around

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:10.598
and I can't take people
leaving me anymore,

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.434
so I need you to stay.

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:15.636
Please,
I need to think that

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:19.240
I'm worth somebody
sticking around for.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.043
( coughing )

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.546
- Oh, Ted!
- Hey, Ted, it's me.

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:28.249
- Your brother, Luck.
- ( coughing )

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:30.251
I love you, man.
Say something.

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:33.654
I saw... Dad.

01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:37.558
And Wammy.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.159
Oh, my God!

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:41.595
He was under too long.
He's fucking retarded now!

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:44.365
Lucky, honey,
I'm sure he's just woozy is all.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:46.200
Daddy...

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:49.637
and Wammy.

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.606
No, no,
that's full-on retard.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:55.476
But it's okay!
I still love you, man.

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:57.177
You're my baby brother.

01:21:57.179 --> 01:21:59.647
We're gonna get the best
retard specialist in the world.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.082
We'll probably have to build
some ramps or something.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:03.484
But it's okay!
It's okay.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:05.352
Nothing's too good
for my baby brother.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:07.621
- Uh, Chief?
- Huh?

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:10.609
I find the word "retarded"
offensive.
My sister's mentally challenged.

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:12.293
Oh, yeah, Kevin,

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:15.596
you're gonna turn this
into a dick measuring contest
now?

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.431
( grunting )

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:20.167
I'm offended, Kevin.

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:24.004
Ted: He didn't break
any bones either?

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:25.706
Lucky: It was the way
we hit the water.

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:27.708
It was a little more
than a 100-foot drop.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:30.444
I penciled, went right down
about 20 feet.

01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:32.513
Popped right back up.
There he was.

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:33.681
You kinda...
( chuckles )

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:35.869
half penciled,
half belly flopped.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.018
Knocked the wind right outta
you.

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:41.288
But the fact that you got
knocked out
probably saved your life.

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:45.459
You were so very brave, Teddy.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:49.530
Jumping in after Zeke
the way you did...

01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:52.232
and being
such a terrible swimmer

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:55.135
- and so afraid of heights.
- Yeah, I know.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:58.639
You know, I never bragged much
about you two growing up,

01:22:58.641 --> 01:22:59.740
but I want to do it now

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:05.579
because I am so very proud
of both of you.

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:08.082
So proud of you.
( kisses )

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:09.216
Thanks, Mom.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:12.086
Okay, Teddy, we gotta go.

01:23:12.088 --> 01:23:14.188
I gotta go see
the hospital psychologist.

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:15.689
Sensitivity training,

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.624
dealing with Zeke's,
you know...

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:22.363
And I'll see you tomorrow
when you're discharged, okay?

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:26.533
- I love you, bro.
- Love you, too, Luck.

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:30.371
- Come on, Mom.
- I'll be back.

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:33.286
( clicks tongue )
Ted.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:41.315
Hi.

01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:42.649
Hi.

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:48.655
The scenery's changin'

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.525
And it warms my soul...

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.160
Thanks for staying.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:55.529
I'm 200 miles down...

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.598
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.733
( laughs )

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:03.370
So get your boots on

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:07.641
And your walking coat

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:10.110
And we'll together
leave our footprints

01:24:10.112 --> 01:24:14.715
- Out upon the virgin snow...
- ( cheering )

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:18.185
That ancient sunrise

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:22.356
- Will soon descend...
- Let's go.

01:24:22.358 --> 01:24:24.625
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- And we'll be left here
pondering

01:24:24.627 --> 01:24:27.528
On the things
which we can depend

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:33.200
So let's start over

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:37.304
With no means to an end

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:39.339
Just an openhearted hope

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:42.743
And a closed hand
full of friends

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:50.517
Yeah, well, London was all
right,
but I was dead in the water

01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:54.488
Couldn't see it in its light,
I couldn't kneel in its altar

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:59.293
All I wanted was to tear it
right down to the ground

01:24:59.295 --> 01:25:02.763
But I'm feeling all right now

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:07.634
Yeah, I'm feeling all right

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:14.875
Every morning

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:19.279
When the coffee's on

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.683
And I rediscover
that color in your eyes

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:26.386
In its gold and its bronze

01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:29.656
And in the moonlight

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.826
We'll get the candles going...

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.497
Ted's voice:
Emerson said it best.

01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:39.399
"When it's darkest,
we can see the stars.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:40.834
They're always there.

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:43.876
You just gotta remember
to tip your head back and look
up."

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:59.753
( music playing )

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:02.389
( vocalizing )

01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:12.332
I'll tell you why,
'cause I don't know why

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:14.868
But I can tell you
how it went

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.638
There's a time,
there was a point in time

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.374
When we just stopped
listening

01:26:20.376 --> 01:26:22.876
There's a ghost
and it haunts this town

01:26:22.878 --> 01:26:25.579
Yeah, it haunts it
up and down

01:26:25.581 --> 01:26:28.415
You're a mess,
yeah, you're a fucking mess

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:30.951
If you don't know that
by now

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:33.554
You don't
know that by now

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:43.830
Still in love with the turn
of your phrase

01:26:43.832 --> 01:26:46.767
You're still the sound
that makes sense

01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:49.303
Through these years

01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:54.508
I don't want you to ask
how I am

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:59.479
I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.450
( vocalizing )

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:13.694
You can fight,
but can you fight yourself?

01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:16.330
'Cause you're busy,
can't you see?

01:27:16.332 --> 01:27:18.832
If it's a heart
you've been looking for

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:21.635
Well, you won't get that
from me

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:24.338
You alone?
Because you look alone

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.873
'Cause you're sitting
on your own

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:29.543
Are you alive?
Well, you look alive

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:32.412
And will you just
pick up the phone?

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.881
Will you just pick up
the phone?

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:44.992
Still in love
with the turn of your phrase

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.894
You're still the sound
that makes sense

01:27:47.896 --> 01:27:50.731
Through these years

01:27:50.733 --> 01:27:55.836
I don't want you to ask
how I am

01:27:55.838 --> 01:28:00.007
I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:06.480
Still in love
with the turn of your phrase

01:28:06.482 --> 01:28:09.049
You're still the sound
that makes sense

01:28:09.317 --> 01:28:11.985
Through these years

01:28:11.987 --> 01:28:17.457
I don't want you to ask
how I am

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:21.328
I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:27.768
Still in love
with the turn of your phrase

01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:30.570
You're still the sound
that makes sense

01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:33.440
Through these years

01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:38.679
I don't want you to ask
how I am

01:28:38.681 --> 01:28:42.482
I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay.

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:44.651
( vocalizing )

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:11.678
( music playing )

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:24.057
Love me tender,
love me sweet

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:27.894
Never let me go

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:34.935
You have made my life
complete

01:29:34.937 --> 01:29:39.005
And I love you so

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:45.512
Love me tender,
love me true

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:49.116
All my dreams fulfilled

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:55.756
For, my darling,
I love you

01:29:55.758 --> 01:29:59.659
And I always will

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:06.566
When at last my dreams come true

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:10.070
Darling, this I know

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:17.010
Happiness will follow you

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:21.448
Just before I go.
