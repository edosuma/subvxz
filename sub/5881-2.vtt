WEBVTT

00:53.178 --> 00:55.304
Should get him to put
another egg in it.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.431
Roger.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.391
Darling, one egg is good .
Two eggs are better.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.602
Tell the, uh, lieutenant, please,

01:01.687 --> 01:04.772
that things are getting a little dry
around Hill 29.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.773
Am I wrong?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.316
All clear in No Man's Land .

01:07.401 --> 01:08.317
Betty?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.070
Roger, you've expressed
your desire for another drink.

01:11.155 --> 01:12.780
No need to take the orders.

01:12.865 --> 01:13.948
Right away, sir.

01:14.032 --> 01:14.949
Wine list,

01:15.033 --> 01:18.745
and I'll have another one of these
while I'm waiting for the list.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.246
Another egg .

01:20.330 --> 01:21.956
Well, I am having fried chicken .

01:22.040 --> 01:23.958
As long as the egg comes first.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.335
My nanny, Belva, made fried chicken .

01:26.420 --> 01:28.963
I used to take it to school
wrapped in wax paper.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.757
His sweet Belvedere.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.008
He really loved that woman .

01:32.092 --> 01:34.135
Had another nanny originally.
German girl.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.971
Round face, enormous bosom .

01:37.055 --> 01:39.724
My parents got rid of her
after the Lindbergh baby.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.309
We thought about getting a nanny.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.060
We have a girl that comes in

01:43.145 --> 01:46.314
who's sort of a housekeeper
and sometimes babysitter.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.568
I'd let her take the children to play group,
sometimes the park.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.778
Belva raised me.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.112
I turned out just fine.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.990
Didn't have to go to a psychiatrist
like some people's kids.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.658
Oh, what's the big deal?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.870
Margaret is practically the last girl
in our building to go.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.206
1 6 years old , wouldn't get out of bed .

02:03.290 --> 02:07.084
I tell you, I cannot wait until that girl
is another man's problem .

02:07.169 --> 02:08.336
What about you , Don?

02:08.420 --> 02:10.880
Did you have a nanny?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.632
I can't tell you about my childhood .

02:12.716 --> 02:14.759
It would ruin the first half of my novel .

02:14.843 --> 02:16.969
Don doesn't like to talk about himself.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.429
I know better than to ask.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.598
An ad man who doesn't like
to talk about himself?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.016
I think I may cry.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.936
It's not that interesting a story.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.022
Just think of me as Moses.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.024
I was a baby in a basket.

02:30.108 --> 02:34.153
To Moses and Don Draper:
a couple of princes.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.826
If the gentlemen will be patient.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.160
I'll join you .

02:50.295 --> 02:54.507
I think I may know more about your wife
than I do about my own .

02:54.591 --> 02:56.342
Maybe your wife is just a better drinker.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.135
Entirely possible.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.110
Mona, could you help me here?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.530
I seem to have grown a set of thumbs.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.616
Do you ever have that
when your hands go numb?

03:22.494 --> 03:24.662
You want me to touch you up?

03:24.746 --> 03:27.164
Yeah , I think you'll have to.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.252
Look at those lips.

03:31.336 --> 03:35.631
I'll bet it's not hard for you
to hold on to a man like that.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.175
Don't smile. It'll make it harder.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.974
It's hard to hold on to anything
right now with the. . .children

03:45.058 --> 03:46.809
and running the house and--

03:46.894 --> 03:48.102
I don't know if I told you ,

03:48.186 --> 03:51.564
but my m-mother died two, three months ago.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.525
I'm sorry.

03:54.610 --> 03:58.195
There are other ladies
waiting to use the mirror.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.206
Those purses get any smaller,
we're gonna starve.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.132
I love seeing you like that.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.135
Well, you were sitting on my good side.

04:21.219 --> 04:26.098
No. I mean , the way
other people see you .

04:26.183 --> 04:28.726
When you're with strangers,
you know exactly what you want.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.313
Well, I like to think
I always know what I want.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.149
Slow down .

04:35.233 --> 04:37.193
I'll have to put that in my diary:

04:37.277 --> 04:40.279
Lobster Newburg and gimlets
should get a divorce.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.907
They're not getting along very well.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.659
Once you rounded the corner
on number two,

04:44.743 --> 04:46.535
I took it for a case of nerves.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.580
He's your boss.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.166
He likes you .

04:52.250 --> 04:55.670
Toots Shor means he likes me.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.588
When he gets us to the Four Seasons,

04:57.673 --> 04:59.840
then we'll know he trusts me.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.802
H mm . He seemed very forthcoming .

05:02.886 --> 05:05.972
Yeah . When he's stoned on martinis.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.182
I don't know.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.309
It all seemed like an invitation to you

05:10.394 --> 05:14.021
to con-- confide.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.315
Well, maybe it's just manners,

05:16.400 --> 05:19.902
but I was raised to see it
as a sin of pride

05:19.987 --> 05:22.446
to go on like that about yourself.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.573
You're so reverent.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.214
Did you have a nanny?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.882
I've never asked you that.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.219
Why? What difference does it make?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.972
I don't know.
We've never talked about it.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.516
Did you?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.812
No, of course not.

05:56.314 --> 06:01.110
So your mother and father
are responsible for all this?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.446
I'll have to thank them someday.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.364
Jesus, Bets.

06:05.449 --> 06:10.619
It's like politics, religion, or sex.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.496
Why talk about it?

06:16.126 --> 06:17.668
I see your point.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.280
Who is in there?

06:55.832 --> 06:59.376
Peggy, next step is accessories.

06:59.461 --> 07:03.672
$35 a week, minus 6.75 for FICA.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.965
Can you believe it?

07:05.092 --> 07:08.177
Maybe it's the fumes
from the rubber cement on that envelope,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.262
but there's nothing to be happy about here,

07:10.347 --> 07:13.099
although you never forget your first.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.477
For two weeks I've been telling people
I have a job in Manhattan .

07:16.561 --> 07:19.313
Look at you . You're indomitable.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.233
You'd never know you were the very bottom
of the food chain .

07:23.902 --> 07:26.987
Bridget? Are you okay?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.328
Thanks to the Precision Valve Corporation ,

07:34.412 --> 07:35.621
for the next 1 8 months,

07:35.705 --> 07:39.458
Gillette is the only company on Earth
that can spray deodorant out of a can .

07:39.543 --> 07:42.711
Modern deodorant for a modern man .

07:42.796 --> 07:45.256
He prefers jet travel to train travel,

07:45.340 --> 07:46.882
vodka to Scotch,

07:46.967 --> 07:50.136
and he likes to get his news
from the radio, not the paper.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.345
Harold Hill, give it a rest.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.347
"Do not puncture or incinerate."

07:53.431 --> 07:54.807
Sounds dangerous.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.811
Hey, I got a dud .

08:02.065 --> 08:03.899
How is it a guy as big as you , Ken,

08:03.984 --> 08:05.818
has no basketball skills?

08:05.902 --> 08:08.654
I'm sure more research is needed .

08:09.906 --> 08:11.991
We should try it out.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.742
Who smells bad in here?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.704
Oh, no. Come on .

08:16.788 --> 08:18.372
- Come on, Kenny.
- Knock it off!

08:18.456 --> 08:20.124
Just pretend it's prom night.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.375
You can be the girl.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.376
Stop!

08:22.460 --> 08:23.377
Engage rockets.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.461
All right, close your eyes.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.633
Mr. Draper, I was buzzing you .

08:29.718 --> 08:31.468
Mr. Cooper is waiting .

08:33.096 --> 08:34.763
I always thought it was Sterling

08:34.848 --> 08:37.892
who was responsible
for the Navy attitude around this place.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.059
Brassiere account.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.188
Just figured out
we can't sell them to men .

08:42.272 --> 08:46.025
So much yarn, so little time.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.408
So Roger mentioned this N ixon thing .

08:54.492 --> 08:55.701
Yeah , he mentioned it.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.286
I just assumed it went away.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.121
It didn't.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.540
Last I read, Nixon was
running without an agency.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.417
Make no mistake, we know better

09:03.501 --> 09:06.879
what Dick Nixon needs
better than Dick Nixon .

09:06.963 --> 09:08.422
What does Dick Nixon think he needs?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.883
What he already has: Ted Rogers,

09:10.967 --> 09:13.427
the brains behind that Checkers broadcast.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.470
See the problem?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.347
He dodged a financial scandal

09:16.431 --> 09:18.682
by standing with his wife
and begging for his dog .

09:18.767 --> 09:20.184
An admission wrapped in a distraction .

09:20.268 --> 09:21.435
I'd say they know what they're doing .

09:21.519 --> 09:22.519
Dogs are winners.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.812
Well , they think they're set without us.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.522
Why chase a girl who doesn't
want to get caught?

09:25.607 --> 09:27.316
You have a problem with N ixon?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.442
I don't vote.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.861
Hear, hear.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.154
But politics aside,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.906
these last eight years have been good to us

09:33.990 --> 09:35.991
because they've been good
to Proctor & Gamble

09:36.076 --> 09:38.827
and The United Fruit Company,
et cetera.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.454
So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not--

09:40.538 --> 09:44.750
We will give our people
what they want, agreed?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.585
I said cut it out!

09:46.670 --> 09:47.795
Be my pleasure.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.546
Goodie.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.092
Assemble a team .

09:53.176 --> 09:54.468
Start files on contenders:

09:54.552 --> 09:55.678
Symington, Kennedy--

09:55.762 --> 09:59.640
Who knows? Maybe Eleanor Roosevelt
will throw her feedbag into the ring .

09:59.724 --> 10:01.183
Don , you still on for lunch?

10:02.227 --> 10:03.227
No.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.484
Don't tell me that's lunch .

10:10.568 --> 10:12.486
I've got a lot of work to catch up on .

10:12.570 --> 10:13.570
I do that sometimes.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.489
Saunter over to the pie cart.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.491
Egg salad and the worst
cup of coffee in the world .

10:17.575 --> 10:18.492
35 cents.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.494
I've been meaning to try it.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.455
It's okay if you like ptomaine poisoning .

10:25.583 --> 10:26.709
Well , toodle-oo.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.506
Secretary 1 , copywriter 0.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.507
It wasn't that.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.510
I bring my lunch at least until after
the first of the month .

10:36.594 --> 10:38.304
Get your things.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.098
That sandwich is making me sad .

10:44.019 --> 10:47.479
It's a postcard from Campbell
on his honeymoon .

10:47.564 --> 10:48.897
Niagara Falls.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.650
"Greetings from the wettest place on earth ."

10:53.528 --> 10:54.778
I say we skip lunch altogether

10:54.863 --> 10:57.948
and try on those narrow sweater sets
I saw at Lord and Taylor.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.742
Do you want me to sit
outside the dressing room

10:59.826 --> 11:01.535
and hold your purse?

11:01.619 --> 11:04.121
What he's trying to say is
can we buy you lunch?

11:04.205 --> 11:06.206
Oh . I don't know.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.541
We hadn't planned on eating .

11:07.625 --> 11:08.709
Come on , three on two.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.085
I know you all like being outnumbered .

11:10.170 --> 11:11.628
That's two on two. I'm married .

11:12.630 --> 11:14.548
You still have to eat lunch .

11:14.632 --> 11:16.759
What do you say? Change of plans?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.385
They do smell nice.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.554
What's that?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.348
Postcard from Pete Campbell.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.724
He's on a honeymoon, right?

11:23.808 --> 11:24.850
Niagara Falls.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.394
He hasn't, uh , left the room , apparently.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.110
Shall we?

11:41.076 --> 11:45.579
So, Pegs, you part of our nation's
military industrial

11:45.663 --> 11:47.790
boyfriend-girlfriend complex?

11:47.874 --> 11:48.916
Excuse me?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.586
He wants to know are you , uh , taken ,
are you kept, or merely browsing?

11:52.670 --> 11:53.587
She's browsing .

11:53.671 --> 11:54.963
And like most of us,

11:55.048 --> 11:57.633
she's disappointed
with the selection of merchandise.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.844
Perhaps I can interest you in a 42 long?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.137
That's not his suit size.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.140
She blushes.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.308
No, I don't.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.854
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but, uh,
you are the subject of much debate.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.106
Money riding on the outcome.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.315
Money for me?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.567
Now there's even a third possibility:

12:15.652 --> 12:16.693
paying you .

12:18.154 --> 12:20.072
We should be getting back.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.407
I'll get the check.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.575
My goodness.
Thank you for lunch, boys.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.619
Yes. Thank you .

12:28.706 --> 12:30.624
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

12:30.708 --> 12:35.379
We could . , .go to the zoo,
see what the animals are up to.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.049
I should get back to work.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.717
Or shopping .

12:42.429 --> 12:44.638
Guess I don't see any money
changing hands, Kenny.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.639
You'll see.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.100
My persistence is my charm .

12:48.184 --> 12:49.726
That was delicious.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.192
You enjoy yourself with the Hitler Youth?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.445
Oh . Well, it was kind of last-minute.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.864
Easy. See that Draper takes a look at this.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.323
Certainly.

13:04.742 --> 13:05.909
You can look, too.

13:11.749 --> 13:15.419
Three of the last PTA presidents
are from the kindergarten class.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.504
I say you go in there
and lay some groundwork.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.674
I will not have Marilyn Kechner
dictate the agenda.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.801
The woman is obsessed with nutrition ,

13:22.886 --> 13:24.678
although you wouldn't
know it to look at her.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.097
Francine, you're terrible.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.225
Ooh . I ran into Juanita Cabot
at square dancing ,

13:30.351 --> 13:33.270
and I found out who's moving
into that little Dutch Colonial down the street.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.563
Who?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.690
Her name is Helen Bishop.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.358
Is she an old lady?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.693
Divorced .

13:39.777 --> 13:42.112
Really?

13:42.197 --> 13:44.781
9-year-old boy and a baby.

13:45.783 --> 13:46.700
That's awful .

13:46.784 --> 13:47.701
I know.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.702
All on her own?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.954
I know.

13:51.039 --> 13:55.709
Can you imagine worrying about money
at this point in our lives?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.711
Well, obviously,
that's not the worst of it.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.005
No.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.715
No, it isn't.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.134
It is too quiet in there.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.135
Ernie?

14:05.220 --> 14:06.136
Sally?

14:06.221 --> 14:08.347
We're playing spaceman .

14:10.558 --> 14:12.351
Sally Draper, come over here this minute.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.649
If the clothes from that dry cleaning bag
are on the floor of my closet,

14:18.733 --> 14:20.817
you're going to be
a very sorry young lady.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.156
Make sure your brother hasn't climbed
out of the play yard .

14:26.241 --> 14:29.535
Juanita thinks it might be bad
for real estate values in Chilmark.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.119
One divorcée?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.598
Oh , my God .

15:32.682 --> 15:33.890
Are you okay?

16:05.923 --> 16:08.717
What's that?

16:08.801 --> 16:09.760
What?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.470
That.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.847
That's a television .

16:13.931 --> 16:15.682
Since when do you have a television?

16:15.767 --> 16:19.811
I don't know. I think it's been about ten days.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.522
It's been so amazing , I sort of lost track.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.982
I seem to remember a woman

16:24.067 --> 16:26.443
wasting a good piece
of a beautiful afternoon

16:26.527 --> 16:28.445
reciting this diatribe against television

16:28.529 --> 16:32.240
that should have ended
with her banging her shoe on the table.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.871
Don, darling , if you want
to ask the question, just ask it.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.414
Where'd you get the TV?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.875
I got it.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.377
Same place you got that wig?

16:43.461 --> 16:45.337
Someone gave it to me.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.882
And you took it?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.718
Have you seen this thing
called People Are Funny?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.014
Jesus.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.974
Oh, Jesus, Don .

17:04.440 --> 17:05.899
Hey!

17:05.983 --> 17:07.317
All better?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.987
Yes.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.747
How about a hot dog?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.334
Sit at your places. Come on .

17:39.892 --> 17:40.809
Daddy!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.060
We went to the hospital.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.020
We got lollipops.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.402
They're fine, Don .

17:52.321 --> 17:53.321
What about you?

17:53.406 --> 17:56.241
A little sore.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.826
A little embarrassed .

17:57.910 --> 17:59.953
Sorry they couldn't get a hold of me.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.206
We had to carry Freddie Rumson
out of Ritazzi's.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.208
There was nothing you could have done.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.883
Daddy, use a fork.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.969
How's the car?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.137
Not bad .

18:17.221 --> 18:20.557
Uh, thank God
I was only going 25 tops.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.975
I hate the way you drive, you know.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.977
I'm finished .

18:24.061 --> 18:25.979
Can I go watch
shirley Temple's storybook?

18:26.063 --> 18:27.606
Yes, both of you .

18:35.698 --> 18:37.574
So what happened?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.868
I don't know, really.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.663
It-- It all happened so fast.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.875
What, 20 miles an hour?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.543
That's not that fast.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.713
It's stupid .

18:51.798 --> 18:53.465
Was it Sally playing with the radio again?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.008
- I've warned her.
- No, she was fine.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.344
She was just sitting there. No.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.098
It was my hands. It happened again .

19:06.103 --> 19:07.312
Jesus.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.566
Betty, you have to get this taken care of.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.027
That Dr. Patterson is not thorough .

19:14.111 --> 19:15.862
I swear, when we walked
down Park Avenue,

19:15.947 --> 19:16.863
I could hear the quacking .

19:16.948 --> 19:18.114
I know. You've said that.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.534
This doctor was nice.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.828
He was older, actually.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.329
He's from Rochester.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.414
He has two children.
They're 1 0 years apart.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.375
Okay, you've given me his credentials.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.043
What did he say?

19:30.127 --> 19:33.588
Well, he said I could go to New York
and run the dye tests,

19:33.673 --> 19:37.509
and I said that I already had
and that the results were negative,

19:37.593 --> 19:39.469
and he even called Dr. Patterson .

19:41.639 --> 19:43.014
So?

19:43.099 --> 19:49.020
They said there was
nothing physically wrong with me.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.647
Then I t-told him what happened ,

19:50.731 --> 19:54.317
and he said that I should
see a psychiatrist.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.574
Doctors must love

20:00.658 --> 20:04.077
that they now have an answer
for "I don't know what's wrong ."

20:04.161 --> 20:05.662
He said it could be a nervous condition .

20:05.746 --> 20:07.789
Nervous about what, driving?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.666
So we'll go down to the Grand Union
parking lot.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.834
We'll practice your 1 0 and 2.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.752
He seemed very concerned,
if you want to know.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.170
But that's their solution .

20:14.255 --> 20:16.756
Why not open the hood
and poke around?

20:18.801 --> 20:19.718
So?

20:19.802 --> 20:23.388
So. . . I left.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.890
What else am I supposed to do?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.057
Well, go to a doctor--

20:26.142 --> 20:27.142
another doctor, a good one.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.769
I'll get a specialist from Bert Cooper.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.105
H is name's on a wall
over at St. Vincent's.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.565
Okay.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.734
Leave the dishes for the girl.

20:39.196 --> 20:44.242
7, 8, 9,

20:44.327 --> 20:49.331
1 0, 1 1 , 1 2--

20:49.415 --> 20:55.420
98, 99, 1 00.

21:08.392 --> 21:12.103
You know, I do worry about you , birdie.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.605
I know.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.029
When he brought it up, I was shocked .

21:23.074 --> 21:26.284
Although , I realize that
that's what Dr. Patterson

21:26.369 --> 21:29.621
was trying to say in his own way, and--

21:32.375 --> 21:36.378
it doesn't have. . .
as much of a stigma today.

21:39.256 --> 21:42.300
I just don't know
what they can possibly tell you .

21:45.638 --> 21:48.348
Do you think I need a psychiatrist?

21:55.815 --> 22:00.276
I always thought people saw a psychiatrist
when they were unhappy.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.114
But I look at you . . .

22:05.282 --> 22:06.992
and this. . .

22:08.327 --> 22:10.120
and them . . .

22:14.917 --> 22:16.334
and that. . .

22:19.338 --> 22:21.798
and I think, "Are you unhappy?"

22:25.177 --> 22:27.971
Of course I'm happy.

22:28.055 --> 22:31.016
Well, that'll be $35. You're welcome.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.228
Whatever you think is best.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.312
Good .

23:04.341 --> 23:06.760
Act of God . Sorry.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.596
Someone threw themselves
in front of the train .

23:09.680 --> 23:11.806
Ah , suicide.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.312
Okay, boys, what do we have?

23:18.355 --> 23:22.776
Gentlemen , the aerosol can
is nothing less than space-age.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.319
It's steel . It has exhaust.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.029
It's even shaped like a rocket.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.448
Certainly an engineering marvel.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.283
"Right Guard :

23:30.367 --> 23:33.078
it works in my suit or yours."

23:33.162 --> 23:35.663
We'll punch the yellow of the moon
so it pops behind him .

23:41.504 --> 23:42.712
We're looking for new worlds,

23:42.797 --> 23:45.298
and with that search
comes any number of gadgets.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.300
It's not just some random association .

23:47.384 --> 23:49.928
This thing is shiny. It's explosive.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.597
It's from the future,
a place so close to us now,

23:52.681 --> 23:54.516
filled with wonder and ease.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.312
Except some people
think of the future and it upsets them .

24:00.397 --> 24:02.607
They see a rocket,
they start building a bomb shelter.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.359
What? How do you get there?

24:04.443 --> 24:07.987
I don't think it's ridiculous to assume
we're looking for other planets

24:08.072 --> 24:10.115
because this one will end .

24:10.199 --> 24:12.283
I thought we had something here.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.327
Who is this moron flying around space?

24:14.411 --> 24:16.412
I mean , he pees in his pants.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.960
Brass tacks, who buys this?

24:22.044 --> 24:24.254
Some woman .

24:24.338 --> 24:27.549
Your girl or your mother will pick this up

24:27.633 --> 24:30.426
walking through the grocery store
or the druggist's.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.262
We should be asking ourselves,

24:32.346 --> 24:33.471
"What do women want?"

24:33.556 --> 24:36.057
I don't know, but I wish I had it.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.395
Maybe a chesty alien girl
also wants to get into his suit.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.938
I'm not asking "what do women want"

24:42.022 --> 24:44.357
in some bullshit
research psychology way.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.860
I'm asking ,
what would make a woman

24:46.944 --> 24:49.529
look at this man's deodorant
and say "I want that"?

24:49.613 --> 24:51.781
Well, I've stopped
trying to figure out what they think.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.449
Maybe I should stop paying you .

24:57.913 --> 25:00.373
Well, I always thought
women like the way we smell.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.958
That explains a lot.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.418
I feel like we're close here.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.919
I mean , this one--

25:05.004 --> 25:08.381
the can's right side up,
but the guy's upside-down .

25:08.465 --> 25:10.842
No. Let's bring it down to Earth .

25:14.263 --> 25:16.973
You think they want a cowboy?

25:17.057 --> 25:20.393
He's quiet and strong.

25:20.477 --> 25:24.480
He always brings the cattle home safe.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.360
You watch TV.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.489
What if they want something else?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.868
Inside, some. . .

25:38.621 --> 25:41.873
mysterious wish that we're ignoring .

26:01.560 --> 26:03.144
How'd it go?

26:04.480 --> 26:05.897
I've still got my novel.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.523
I'm sorry.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.777
Buy me lunch?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.531
Samuel, that drape, man?

26:15.616 --> 26:17.158
It's sadder than a map.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.453
Well, it's lightweight,
and it tells me I'm at work.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.497
But you sure can talk, Mr. Kinsey.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.831
60 cents.

26:23.916 --> 26:27.126
What are you doing? Keep the change.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.546
You figured the place out yet?

26:30.631 --> 26:31.756
What do you mean?

26:31.840 --> 26:32.966
How it runs.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.635
I know the copywriters
tell the Art Department what to do,

26:35.719 --> 26:38.471
and I know the account executives
tell the copywriters what to do.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.931
What?

26:40.015 --> 26:42.725
No one tells the writers what to do
except for the head of Creative,

26:42.810 --> 26:45.478
your boss, Donald Draper.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.690
Don't think that just because
he's good-looking , he's not a writer.

26:48.774 --> 26:49.732
Dig .

26:49.817 --> 26:51.526
This is the Media Department.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.653
They're where 90% of where
the client's check goes.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.531
They buy space-- newspapers,
billboards, television ,

26:56.615 --> 26:59.617
and my favorite aging whore, radio.

26:59.702 --> 27:02.829
That's the whole shakedown, actually.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.497
All you really need to know.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.166
They don't sell ideas
or campaigns or jingles.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.544
They sell media at a 1 5% markup.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.962
Creative is just window dressing

27:11.046 --> 27:11.963
that's thrown in for free.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.381
Really?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.425
Accounting, they keep track
of how much we're spending

27:15.509 --> 27:16.509
versus how much we're taking in,

27:16.593 --> 27:18.303
and since we're buying futures,

27:18.387 --> 27:23.057
if you ever, ever see, um ,
the man upstairs go in there,

27:23.142 --> 27:24.517
grab the lifeboats, baby.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.394
We're going down .

27:28.439 --> 27:30.315
Account Management,

27:30.399 --> 27:34.527
where prep schoolers skip arm-in-arm ,
Wizard of Oz style,

27:34.611 --> 27:38.614
joined together by their lack of skill
and their love of mirrors.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.659
Account executives
are all good at something ,

27:41.744 --> 27:45.538
although it's never advertising .

27:45.622 --> 27:49.917
Submitted for your approval:
one Peter Campbell ,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.544
a man who recently discovered

27:51.628 --> 27:55.590
that the only place for his hand
is in your pocket.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.717
You watch it?

27:57.801 --> 27:59.677
Have you seen it? The Twilight Zone ?

27:59.762 --> 28:02.930
I don't think so,
I don't like science fiction .

28:03.015 --> 28:05.308
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.560
Mitch in Media says
CBS might pull the plug .

28:07.644 --> 28:09.145
I'll kill myself.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.362
And here we have
the Creative Department,

28:17.446 --> 28:19.364
the talent, home sweet home.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.407
Like the Art Department downstairs,

28:21.492 --> 28:23.618
they put us far enough
away from the elevators

28:23.702 --> 28:25.661
so we can't sneak out.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.585
You know,

28:32.669 --> 28:35.588
there are women copywriters.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.465
- Good ones?
- Sure.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.385
I mean , y-you can always tell
when a woman's writing copy,

28:40.469 --> 28:43.971
but sometimes she just might be
the right man for the job, you know?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.309
You must be very creatively satisfied .

28:48.394 --> 28:50.770
Let's not lose our heads.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.940
Sterling-Coop is positively Cro-Magnon .

28:54.024 --> 28:56.150
I have a friend-- I'm not even going
to say what agency--

28:56.235 --> 28:58.611
but all they do is smoke Mary Jane
and play darts,

28:58.695 --> 29:01.155
and honestly, I think
they're the best store on the street.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.827
You like U krainian food?

29:05.911 --> 29:08.162
Oxtail dumplings?

29:08.247 --> 29:10.373
I still have a lot of work to do.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.874
I think he's still in there.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.251
Huh . Got it.

29:14.628 --> 29:17.547
Thanks for lunch .
Sorry about your copy.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.632
Thanks for reminding me.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.278
Can never get used
to the fact that most of the time

29:40.362 --> 29:41.737
it looks like you're doing nothing .

29:43.198 --> 29:45.074
Fix you something?

29:45.159 --> 29:48.077
4:30. Close enough .

29:48.162 --> 29:49.328
Coop is gonna want a carve-in

29:49.413 --> 29:51.456
with your handpicked team for Nixon on it,

29:51.540 --> 29:55.668
and I warn you right now,
it includes Pete Campbell.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.503
I should go to N iagara Falls for two weeks.

29:57.588 --> 29:58.963
Does wonders for your career.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.756
Niagara Falls.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.551
Boy redefines lack of imagination .

30:06.597 --> 30:08.890
Ah . That's where you've been .

30:08.974 --> 30:12.685
Let me ask you something .

30:12.769 --> 30:13.853
What do women want?

30:13.937 --> 30:16.022
Who cares?

30:17.774 --> 30:18.900
You mentioned the other night

30:18.984 --> 30:22.695
that your daughter
had been to a psychiatrist.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.782
I'm sure you must be mistaken about that.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.370
You know what?

30:31.455 --> 30:35.249
I am very comfortable with my mind :
thoughts clean and unclean ,

30:35.334 --> 30:38.085
loving and . . . the opposite of that.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.255
But I'm not a woman .

30:41.340 --> 30:42.798
And I think it behooves any man

30:42.883 --> 30:46.928
to toss all female troubles
into the hands of a stranger.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.721
We had one headshrinker in the army.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.141
A gossip, busting
with other people's thoughts.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.101
Hasn't changed much, just costs more.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.728
And you can't shoot at them .

30:55.812 --> 30:57.063
We live in troubling times.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.564
We do?

31:00.025 --> 31:02.777
Who could not be happy with all this?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.320
Jesus, you know what they want?

31:04.404 --> 31:05.655
Everything .

31:05.739 --> 31:08.449
Especially if the other girls have it.

31:08.534 --> 31:13.162
Trust me, psychiatry is just
this year's candy-pink stove.

31:18.168 --> 31:20.378
It's just more happiness.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.845
People. . .

31:30.847 --> 31:31.847
Are. . .

31:33.267 --> 31:34.850
Funny!

31:36.603 --> 31:38.020
Beauty and the beast.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.397
Hey, Daddy.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.775
Hey, there. Cold lamb sound good?

31:42.859 --> 31:44.485
Yeah .

31:49.157 --> 31:51.826
Someone started on the train .

31:51.910 --> 31:53.160
In the office.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.122
Because of a good day or a bad day?

31:57.833 --> 32:01.335
You know, when I told you
you had everything . . .

32:02.879 --> 32:04.880
I was wrong .

32:08.719 --> 32:10.469
Oh , my God .

32:12.180 --> 32:13.806
White gold .

32:13.890 --> 32:18.603
It's got one of those tiny little faces
that you have to be young to see.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.563
Don , it's beautiful .

32:22.107 --> 32:25.818
The guy at the store set the time,
but he was English,

32:25.902 --> 32:27.820
so it might be six hours off.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.781
Did you look at Sally's face?

32:30.866 --> 32:32.033
I think she has a bruise.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.367
I didn't see it.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.703
On her cheekbone under her eye.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.079
I thought that was ketchup.

32:37.164 --> 32:41.208
What if she had gotten a scar,
something permanent?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.085
I don't want to play what-if.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.838
I'm just saying if it happened to Bobby
it would have been okay

32:45.922 --> 32:49.634
because a boy with a scar is nothing ,
but a girl, it's so much worse.

32:49.718 --> 32:50.843
Nothing happened .

32:50.927 --> 32:52.845
I keep. . .

32:52.929 --> 32:53.929
thinking--

32:55.974 --> 32:58.851
Not that I c-could have killed the kids,

32:58.935 --> 33:04.190
but. . .worse.

33:04.274 --> 33:07.860
Sally could have survived . . .

33:07.944 --> 33:10.363
and gone on living with this. . .

33:10.447 --> 33:14.700
horrible scar on her face, and . . .

33:14.785 --> 33:19.080
some long, lonely. . .

33:20.666 --> 33:22.041
miserable life as--

33:25.253 --> 33:26.921
Don.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.974
What's happening to me?

33:42.771 --> 33:44.522
Do I need to see someone?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.447
I don't know.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.951
I guess so.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.037
Whatever you want.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.802
1 1 a.m . Did you get fired?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.389
Brought Betty into the city to see the doctor,

34:18.473 --> 34:21.809
but, uh , honestly. . .

34:21.893 --> 34:25.646
I think I'm the one that's not feeling so great.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.940
I called in sick.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.735
Don't bring that here.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.612
I'm serious, Don .
Don't talk to me about her.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.991
It makes me feel cruel.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.041
You're right.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.044
Sometimes.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.507
I can't decide

34:53.592 --> 34:56.761
if you have everything . . .

34:56.845 --> 34:58.554
or nothing.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.598
I live in the moment.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.314
Nothing is everything .

35:09.858 --> 35:12.777
Sounds more like you live in the Village.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.112
Actually, I live in the hall .

35:15.197 --> 35:16.822
I lost my key.

35:16.907 --> 35:20.075
I had to, um . . .
spend the night abroad .

35:20.160 --> 35:21.994
Could you be a gentleman

35:22.078 --> 35:25.080
and break in to the fire escape
so I don't have to?

35:34.716 --> 35:36.008
Draper in yet?

35:36.092 --> 35:38.177
He's not coming in today,
He's not feeling well .

35:38.261 --> 35:41.096
I'm leaving . Don't tell anyone I was here.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.940
Bienvenue.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.276
No, it's Peggy.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.695
Hello.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.158
I don't think I can go out to lunch today.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.785
Mr. Draper's not coming in.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.079
That means youcan go out to lunch .

36:05.163 --> 36:07.081
Have you never worked
in an office before?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.041
Well, he could call.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.042
It's my second week.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.710
Another time?

36:11.795 --> 36:13.879
I did enjoy the tour the other day.

36:13.964 --> 36:15.047
It was eye-opening .

36:15.131 --> 36:18.133
I didn't think your eyes
could be any wider.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.760
That's clever.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.767
I guess I'll go to the cart.
You want something?

36:29.354 --> 36:30.354
What?

36:32.148 --> 36:33.649
The office is gonna
empty out any second .

36:33.733 --> 36:35.484
We can push the couch
in front of the door.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.653
Paul .

36:37.737 --> 36:41.073
Do you belong to someone else?

36:41.157 --> 36:43.701
Shit.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.786
I don't even like to sit in Don's chair.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.955
I think we've
misunderstood each other.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.670
But there is someone else, right?

36:54.754 --> 36:55.880
Yes.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.777
I hope you know that covering
your typewriter

37:18.862 --> 37:21.155
is office code for "I'm done for the day."

37:21.239 --> 37:22.698
I'm not feeling so swell.

37:22.782 --> 37:26.160
Neither am I . Look at these letters
you typed after lunch .

37:26.244 --> 37:31.624
Terre Haute, Indiana,
has two Rs and an A and an E at the end .

37:31.708 --> 37:33.417
I think either you missed
home row by a hand ,

37:33.501 --> 37:35.836
or you were out drinking
with the junior account boys again .

37:35.921 --> 37:36.837
I wasn't drinking .

37:36.922 --> 37:38.631
I don't like your tone.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.134
I'll redo these right away.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.428
Look at you , all in a snit.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.473
Are you gonna watch me?

37:47.557 --> 37:48.891
What is wrong with you?

37:50.226 --> 37:53.145
Honestly, why is it that every time

37:53.229 --> 37:55.272
a man takes you
out to lunch around here,

37:55.357 --> 37:57.191
you're-- you're the dessert?

37:57.275 --> 37:58.484
That's terrible.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.486
It's constant from every corner.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.155
I'm from Bay Ridge. We have manners.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.949
Why can't they just leave it alone?

38:05.033 --> 38:07.159
Because men always
bother you all the time.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.787
They follow you down the street.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.330
Well, not exactly.

38:11.414 --> 38:14.166
Look, dear, I don't know you that well ,

38:14.250 --> 38:16.168
but you're the new girl,
and you're not much,

38:16.252 --> 38:18.420
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.422
Of course.

38:20.507 --> 38:21.840
Don't be that way.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.926
I'm just offering some perspective, that's all .

38:26.221 --> 38:27.221
Thank you , Joan .

38:27.305 --> 38:28.847
I'll save my thank-yous

38:28.932 --> 38:30.766
till you correct that correspondence.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.682
I don't know why I'm here.

39:55.852 --> 39:57.519
I'm-- I mean, I do.

39:57.604 --> 40:03.484
I'm . . .nervous, I guess.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.402
Anxious.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.073
I don't sleep that well.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.701
And my hands--

40:14.954 --> 40:16.622
Well , they're fine now.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.877
It's like when you have
a problem with your car

40:21.961 --> 40:25.380
and you go to the mechanic
and it's not doing it anymore.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.927
Not that you are a mechanic.

40:36.392 --> 40:40.187
I guess a lot of people must come here
worried about the bomb.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.522
Is that true?

40:45.860 --> 40:47.820
It's a common nightmare, people say.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.905
I read it in a magazine.

40:57.705 --> 41:02.543
My mother always told me
that it wasn't polite to talk about yourself.

41:06.172 --> 41:09.383
She passed away recently.

41:12.428 --> 41:14.429
I guess I already said that.

41:19.686 --> 41:20.936
Can I smoke in here?

41:47.797 --> 41:50.257
We're all so lucky to be here.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.636
It's 7:30.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.597
I have to go to Roy's reading .

41:56.681 --> 42:00.642
I have to be there to act surprised
when Jack Kerouac doesn't show.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.814
Lock the door when you leave.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.865
If you're gonna go home,
take a shower.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.408
You stink.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.577
It's because I'm a man.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.746
You seem to forget that sometimes.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.414
I'm lucky they aren't all like you .

42:22.498 --> 42:24.082
I'll take that as a compliment.

42:28.129 --> 42:30.422
What do women want?

42:30.506 --> 42:34.009
Well, one of the things has to be
not being asked something like that.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.595
"What do women want?

42:36.679 --> 42:38.889
You know better than to ask."

42:43.686 --> 42:45.229
Give me a pen .

42:45.313 --> 42:46.605
Jesus.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.530
"What do women want?"

42:57.867 --> 43:00.535
"Any excuse to get closer."

43:01.537 --> 43:03.080
Thank God .

43:04.415 --> 43:07.251
There's that ego people pay to see.

43:16.344 --> 43:17.552
I'll have the filet of sole.

43:17.637 --> 43:18.929
Excellent.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.473
Creamed spinach or creamed corn?

43:21.557 --> 43:22.474
Spinach .

43:22.558 --> 43:23.725
Fried potatoes or au gratin?

43:23.810 --> 43:26.353
Au gratin . With tomato juice to start.

43:26.437 --> 43:27.479
I'll have a goulash.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.147
Very good , sir.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.653
Vodka gimlet.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.280
Old-fashioned .

43:45.373 --> 43:46.790
How was your day?

43:48.584 --> 43:49.668
Fine.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.753
You know, I work with doctors.

43:51.838 --> 43:53.505
They'll say anything you pay them to.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.799
Of course, dear.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.884
Dinner in the city.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.594
I'm glad I'm hungry.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.557
I saw an interesting thing
in the Journal-American.

44:03.641 --> 44:04.766
Apparently, the phone company

44:04.851 --> 44:09.062
wants to start charging people
for unlisted numbers.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.647
That doesn't seem fair.

44:10.732 --> 44:11.898
Some people agree with you ,

44:11.983 --> 44:13.525
and they're giving aliases to Ma Bell .

44:13.609 --> 44:15.068
They call it the nom-de-phone.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.529
Isn't that smart?

44:17.613 --> 44:20.282
Of course, most of them
are pornographic.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.535
The best one?

44:23.619 --> 44:24.536
Pat McGroin.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.538
Oh , my God .

44:26.622 --> 44:28.081
Hard to believe they could print that

44:28.166 --> 44:29.958
in the Journal-American ,
let alone a phone book.

44:42.138 --> 44:43.638
This is nice.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.615
I'll be right up.

45:22.261 --> 45:24.513
Hello.

45:24.597 --> 45:25.597
Sorry to bother you so late.

45:25.681 --> 45:26.681
It's Don Draper.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.433
Oh , hello, Mr. Draper.

45:28.518 --> 45:30.602
No, no. It's not too late at all .

45:30.686 --> 45:32.604
Glad to hear that.

45:32.688 --> 45:34.231
Well?

45:34.315 --> 45:38.944
Well, I had a very interesting hour
with your wife this afternoon.

45:39.028 --> 45:42.906
She's a very anxious young woman.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.991
I think you're doing the right thing .
