00:13.681 --> 00:15.472
Ugh, gross.

00:16.408 --> 00:17.499

00:17.518 --> 00:18.892
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

00:19.912 --> 00:21.428
(exhales)
What are you doing here?

00:21.505 --> 00:22.521
I live here.

00:22.598 --> 00:23.764
Who are you?

00:23.840 --> 00:25.983
Jenni. Jenni with an I.

00:26.602 --> 00:28.101
Mateo. With an O.

00:28.178 --> 00:29.862
OWEN:
What's going on down here?

00:29.938 --> 00:31.179
I thought I heard a scream.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.923
You heard
a few of those last night.

00:32.925 --> 00:34.182
Believe me, we all did.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.593
The walls are very thin
around here.

00:36.595 --> 00:38.929
-(cell phone chimes)
-Uh, that's my ride.

00:38.947 --> 00:40.539
-(giggles)
-Oh...

00:41.767 --> 00:43.208
JENNI: I had fun.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.026
(door opens)

00:45.087 --> 00:46.453
-Don't judge me.
-(door closes)

00:46.530 --> 00:50.031
No judgment.
Just disappointment.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.367
What, just because I wanted
a little personal interaction?

00:52.444 --> 00:54.536
You've been
personally interacting
every night this week.

00:54.613 --> 00:55.629
You are exaggerating.

00:55.781 --> 00:56.780
And by the way, I don't think

00:56.782 --> 00:58.206
that's very sex-positive of you.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.450
I'm not exaggerating.
And I'm not the only one.

01:00.452 --> 01:02.061
Like, you know
people at the firehouse

01:02.212 --> 01:04.454
are starting to call you
One Night Strand?

01:04.456 --> 01:05.880
How would they even know that?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.483
If I keep a secret, I bloat.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.627
Yeah, fine.
I don't have any secrets.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.220
You know what?
I'm not ashamed, either.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.722
MATEO: No one thinks
you should feel ashamed.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.057
We all know
where this is coming from.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.318
Oh, yeah?
Where's it coming from?

01:18.470 --> 01:19.970
Pain.

01:19.988 --> 01:21.896
You got pain, Cap.

01:21.974 --> 01:23.657
Emotional pain.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.584
Why do I feel another
intervention coming on?

01:25.661 --> 01:26.993
We all saw it, okay?

01:27.070 --> 01:28.587
You with Gwyn
at the reopening

01:28.738 --> 01:30.422
with that adorable child.

01:30.499 --> 01:33.609
The adorable child you thought
was yours, but totally isn't.

01:33.611 --> 01:35.652
And now you're acting
like a child, you know,

01:35.745 --> 01:36.987
to drown the pain.

01:37.005 --> 01:39.506
-And now you're pushing it.
-I'm just saying.

01:39.658 --> 01:41.916
I get you wanna find
a connection with someone new,

01:41.936 --> 01:43.418
but that's not gonna be
with some fresh kill

01:43.512 --> 01:44.845
that you drag home
from a singles bar.

01:45.088 --> 01:47.255
I don't know, we made a pretty
good connection last night.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.440
Oh, really?
What do you know about her?

01:48.592 --> 01:51.017
That she likes vodka tonic
and The Cure.

01:51.170 --> 01:54.238
-And she's... Jeanie.
-Jenni.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.116
-Really?
-With an I.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.952
(theme music playing)

02:00.028 --> 02:03.163
-(upbeat music playing)
-(vocalizing)

02:05.701 --> 02:08.043
(indistinct chatter)

02:16.862 --> 02:18.862
Something we can help you with?

02:18.955 --> 02:20.806
I'm looking
for Mr. Judson Ryder.

02:20.957 --> 02:24.459
Yeah, he should be
around here somewhere.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.646
Yeah, he's the big guy
in the back reading the paper.

02:27.873 --> 02:29.231
Alright. Thank you, sir.

02:35.547 --> 02:37.531
(indistinct chatter)

02:41.570 --> 02:42.810
Excuse me? (clears throat)

02:42.830 --> 02:44.496
Excuse me, Mr.-Mr. Ryder?

02:45.649 --> 02:47.224
Yeah.

02:47.226 --> 02:48.983
My name is Wyatt.

02:49.061 --> 02:51.486
Uh, Wyatt... Wyatt Harris.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.506
Oh, Wyatt. You used
to kinda run around

02:54.583 --> 02:56.341
with Garrity's
little brother, right?

02:56.418 --> 02:57.417
No.

02:57.569 --> 02:59.920
No, sir.
I-I don't know who that is.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.329
Okay. What can I do for you?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.681
Well, I was actually
hoping I could have

03:02.908 --> 03:04.349
a moment or two of your time.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.976
Yeah. Okay.

03:06.595 --> 03:08.061
(clears throat)

03:08.914 --> 03:10.230
In private.

03:13.919 --> 03:16.445
Yeah. Sure, come on.

03:17.606 --> 03:19.031
(Judd clears throat)

03:22.945 --> 03:25.704
Sir, it's come to my attention

03:25.855 --> 03:27.497
that, uh...

03:28.434 --> 03:29.691
(exhales)

03:29.710 --> 03:32.118
You're a lot taller
than I expected.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.622
Uh, okay, well, there's
no easy way to say this,

03:35.774 --> 03:37.257
but I think...

03:38.886 --> 03:40.510
I think you're my father.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.098
Wow...

03:46.209 --> 03:49.102
-Hi, Grace.
-GRACE: Hi, guys!

03:49.788 --> 03:50.804
-Hey!
-I know.

03:50.956 --> 03:53.290
-(overlapping chatter)
-(laughter)

03:53.292 --> 03:55.025
-Can I take her?
-GRACE: Yep.

03:56.645 --> 03:57.819
-Hey, babe.
-JUDD: Hey.

03:58.722 --> 03:59.980
I didn't know y'all were coming.

04:00.132 --> 04:04.058
Well, um, we thought it might be
nice to surprise you.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.226
JUDD: Oh.

04:05.637 --> 04:10.323
Well, this day is turning out
to be full of surprises.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.642
Wyatt, this is Grace,
this is my wife,

04:12.661 --> 04:13.827
this is our daughter Charlie.

04:13.963 --> 04:16.813
Grace, this is... Wyatt.

04:16.832 --> 04:18.239
Nice to meet you, Wyatt.

04:18.317 --> 04:20.092
You too, Mrs. Ryder.

04:20.168 --> 04:23.745
Well, I guess I will
leave you guys be, then.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.822
Mr. Ryder, maybe we can
talk about this some other time.

04:25.824 --> 04:27.824
No, I'll tell you what,
why don't you stay right here?

04:27.843 --> 04:29.309
We'll talk about it right now.

04:30.679 --> 04:31.828
Are you sure?

04:31.847 --> 04:34.064
Yeah, I don't keep secrets
from my wife.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.108
Baby, what's going on?

04:36.259 --> 04:38.926
Wyatt seems to be
under the misapprehension

04:39.004 --> 04:42.155
that, uh... I'm his daddy.

04:43.191 --> 04:44.357
Oh. Excuse me?

04:44.676 --> 04:47.677
JUDD:
Hang on, we're about
to clear all that up.

04:47.696 --> 04:49.012
Because I think
that if I'd gotten

04:49.031 --> 04:50.122
somebody around here in trouble

04:50.198 --> 04:53.625
over the last 20 years,
I'd know about it.

04:53.702 --> 04:55.535
Wyatt, what's your mom's name?

04:55.687 --> 04:57.687
Marlene.
Marlene Harris.

04:57.706 --> 04:58.705
I don't know no Marlene.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.965
WYATT:
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

05:00.075 --> 05:02.301
Pretty sure she didn't
get your name either.

05:03.244 --> 05:05.211
She's a barrel racer.

05:05.364 --> 05:06.546
Always told me she met my dad

05:06.623 --> 05:09.957
at the San Antonio
Stock Show & Rodeo in 2005.

05:10.035 --> 05:12.394
Here, this is what she
looked like back then.

05:17.559 --> 05:20.110
(Judd muttering)

05:21.471 --> 05:24.064
I don't know.
Uh, could be 2005.

05:24.216 --> 05:25.490
I don't know. I don't know.

05:25.642 --> 05:28.718
What... How-how did y'all
draw my name out of the hat?

05:28.720 --> 05:31.388
I didn't DNA-OK did.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.390
It's this genetic ancestry site.

05:33.392 --> 05:35.183
It's pretty remarkable,
actually.

05:35.260 --> 05:37.577
I mean, they've even used it
to catch serial killers.

05:37.729 --> 05:39.713
I ain't no serial killer.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.825
And I also don't have my DNA
on some website.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.218
Yeah, you do.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.512
Remember, after we got engaged,

05:47.664 --> 05:50.740
we wanted to learn more
about our family trees?

05:50.759 --> 05:52.392
I had you spit in that tube.

05:53.503 --> 05:55.837
Listen, I am not
trying to blow up

05:55.856 --> 05:58.190
anyone's life or anything.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.174
I don't want any money.

06:00.268 --> 06:03.362
My mom, she doesn't even know
I'm here right now.

06:04.606 --> 06:05.755
(Charlie coos)

06:05.757 --> 06:07.257
WYATT:
You know what?

06:07.275 --> 06:10.184
It's probably a mistake
coming here like this.

06:10.262 --> 06:12.821
I r... I really
do appreciate your time.

06:12.897 --> 06:14.498
Alright, thank you.

06:15.859 --> 06:18.210
-Wyatt.
-WYATT: Ma'am?

06:18.286 --> 06:23.548
Do you have a number
or some way we can contact you?

06:23.625 --> 06:25.133
Yeah.

06:28.872 --> 06:31.139
(typing on phone)

06:32.041 --> 06:33.266
Thank you.

06:34.786 --> 06:36.144
-WYATT: Bye.
-Alright.

06:41.476 --> 06:43.693
-Grace--
-We'll talk about this at home.

06:52.971 --> 06:54.304
Okay, little miss.

06:54.322 --> 06:57.082
Do you want Otto
or Bun-Bun tonight?

06:57.159 --> 06:59.418
Can't you just sleep
with me instead?

06:59.494 --> 07:01.645
I don't want Mr. Whispers
keeping me up.

07:01.663 --> 07:04.664
Then you'll just have
to tell him to go to sleep, too.

07:04.816 --> 07:05.907
GIRL: He never listens.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.761
Well, Daddy and I
are just down the hall.

07:09.913 --> 07:11.579
If Mr. Whispers bugs you,

07:11.657 --> 07:14.157
you just look into
that camera right there

07:14.217 --> 07:16.417
and you call us, okay?

07:16.495 --> 07:18.979
Okay, then I'll take Bun-Bun.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.317
Good night, Katie.

07:25.428 --> 07:27.003
Sleep tight.

07:27.005 --> 07:28.363

10:14.472 --> 10:16.356
Katie. Where's my daughter?

10:16.508 --> 10:18.325
Where's your daughter's bedroom?

10:21.696 --> 10:23.771
<i> Bravo team, we have</i>
<i> a six-year-old girl</i>

10:23.849 --> 10:25.698
<i> who maybe upstairs,</i>
<i> her name is Katie.</i>

10:25.775 --> 10:28.793
Bedroom closest
to delta wall.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.420
JUDD: We're on it, Cap.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.467
PAUL: Yo, it's hot.
Everybody stand back!

10:36.695 --> 10:38.619
One, two, three!

10:38.697 --> 10:40.972
(flames roaring)

10:43.626 --> 10:46.202
FIREFIGHTER (over radio):
<i> Captain Strand,</i>
<i> we've got fire in the attic.</i>

10:46.221 --> 10:48.480
<i> It's spreading fast,</i>
<i> moving on to the rafters.</i>

10:48.631 --> 10:50.464
JUDD: Katie!

10:50.542 --> 10:51.966
PAUL: Katie!

10:52.043 --> 10:53.226
Katie, we're firefighters!

10:53.302 --> 10:54.486
Call out if you can hear us!

10:54.562 --> 10:56.396
Need an update.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.064
JUDD:
We're in her room,
but we don't see her.

10:58.141 --> 10:59.658
OWEN (over radio):
<i> Look under the bed</i>
<i> and in the closet.</i>

10:59.809 --> 11:01.201
JUDD: Katie!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.477
Katie!

11:03.813 --> 11:06.831
FIREFIGHTER:
<i> Hey Cap, structure's</i>
<i> not gonna hold much longer.</i>

11:06.908 --> 11:09.075
(tense music playing)

11:09.227 --> 11:10.910
Abandon your equipment
and evacuate now.

11:11.062 --> 11:12.228
Structure is unsound.

11:12.488 --> 11:14.839
JUDD:
No, we're not leaving
a little girl behind!

11:14.841 --> 11:16.157
Strickland, you copy?

11:16.234 --> 11:17.491
PAUL (over radio):
<i> Yeah, Cap.</i>

11:17.511 --> 11:19.252
I want you and Ward
to remove Judd from the scene.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.012
I don't care if it means
you drag him out.

11:21.164 --> 11:22.847
Charlie is not losing
her daddy tonight.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.350
PAUL: Hey! Hey!
You heard the man. We gotta go!

11:25.501 --> 11:27.744
JUDD: You guys go,
but I'm staying!

11:27.746 --> 11:29.503
PAUL:
Hell, we-we gotta go!

11:29.523 --> 11:31.981
(shouting, grunting)

11:32.526 --> 11:34.250
Judd!

11:34.269 --> 11:36.027
-Judd!
-JUDD: Katie!

11:36.846 --> 11:39.197
(loud rumbling)

11:48.524 --> 11:51.935
I know that, uh,
last night's call...

11:51.937 --> 11:54.713
it was a tough one, but, um...

11:54.864 --> 11:56.197
I just spoke
the arson investigator

11:56.216 --> 11:58.550
and there were no remains
found in the house.

11:58.626 --> 11:59.718
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:59.945 --> 12:01.627
So you're saying
that girl got out of there?

12:01.780 --> 12:02.962
That's what they're telling me.

12:03.114 --> 12:04.948
-JUDD: Praise God.
-See, there.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.466
Aren't you glad
you didn't get flame-broiled

12:06.542 --> 12:07.951
trying to save
a bunch of dollies, man?

12:08.044 --> 12:10.636
Yeah, and thank you for dragging
my ass up out of there, too.

12:10.789 --> 12:12.546
-PAUL: Any time, player.
-MARJAN: Wait, Cap.

12:12.624 --> 12:16.050
If she wasn't in there, then...
where is she?

12:16.127 --> 12:19.128
APD is treating it
as a possible abduction.

12:19.147 --> 12:21.722
But when they find her,
just know that she will have

12:21.816 --> 12:23.575
a family to come home to,

12:23.802 --> 12:25.285
it's 'cause you guys.

12:30.566 --> 12:31.458
(knock on door)

12:32.919 --> 12:34.919
-Hello.
-Can I help you, officer?

12:35.071 --> 12:36.254
We're canvassing
the neighborhood

12:36.405 --> 12:39.740
asking if anyone saw
anything suspicious last night.

12:39.818 --> 12:41.575
-Is it about the fire?
-Mm-hmm.

12:41.653 --> 12:43.319
Did they find
the Conrads' little girl yet?

12:43.321 --> 12:45.764
-No, not yet.
-It's horrible.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.748
Have you noticed
any vehicles lately

12:47.826 --> 12:49.158
that you didn't recognize

12:49.160 --> 12:51.102
parked or cruising
the street?

12:51.254 --> 12:53.420
No. I passed out
on the couch at 8:00.

12:53.498 --> 12:55.398
Sorry, I didn't see anything.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.404
(dramatic music playing)

13:04.100 --> 13:05.784
CARLOS:
Well, what about this?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.512
This is a door cam footage
taken across the street

13:09.531 --> 13:11.180
from Katie's house
the night of the fire.

13:11.199 --> 13:13.958
Just after the fire
started at 12:38 a.m.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.035
Katie walks right out
of the front door.

13:16.187 --> 13:17.444
SARINA: Yeah,
the point of origin

13:17.464 --> 13:18.612
was the child's bedroom.

13:18.690 --> 13:21.024
We already know
she started the fire.

13:21.026 --> 13:22.375
Here comes
the most interesting part.

13:22.451 --> 13:24.710
More interesting than
a seven-year-old arsonist?

13:24.787 --> 13:26.971
-There. See that?
-See what?

13:27.198 --> 13:29.382
-SARINA: She's running away.
-There.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.976
CARLOS:
It doesn't look like she's
running away from something.

13:32.203 --> 13:33.478
It looks like she's running
to something.

13:33.629 --> 13:35.963
Like she was seeing someone
she knew just off-camera.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.390
(scoffs)

13:37.542 --> 13:40.893
Well, she didn't drive herself
out of the neighborhood.

13:41.046 --> 13:42.712
What do you think,
she knew her abductor?

13:42.730 --> 13:45.907
Yes. And that person
convinced her to set the fire.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.142
It's an interesting theory.

13:48.236 --> 13:51.404
I'm happy to start running
checks on friends and family,

13:51.556 --> 13:52.980
see if anybody
throws a red flag.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.724
I appreciate
the initiative, officer,

13:54.726 --> 13:55.983
but I think I got this.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.744
So if you could leave
all your canvassing notes

13:58.821 --> 14:00.296
before you go.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.594
-Of course.
-SARINA: Thank you.

14:08.331 --> 14:10.265
♪

14:26.515 --> 14:28.074
Howdy, howdy. Whoa.

14:29.944 --> 14:31.494
-(door closes)
-Hey.

14:33.932 --> 14:35.582
Did you get inspired?

14:40.438 --> 14:42.088
Did Charlie already go down?

14:43.199 --> 14:44.790
-You just missed her.
-JUDD: Hmm.

14:44.867 --> 14:48.136
I guess I'll try to see her
when you feed her at 2:00.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.224
Baby, just real quick,
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

14:53.301 --> 14:55.209
No, Judd, can you
step off the floor, please?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.228
-Yeah...
-Just stay out of the kitchen
for a second.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.064
I'm sorry, um,
I just mopped all of this.

15:03.886 --> 15:06.529
Can't keep anything clean
in this house with you in it.

15:08.391 --> 15:10.283
You wanna talk about this?

15:15.807 --> 15:19.125
Give it to me straight.
What are the odds that
you're that boy's father?

15:22.647 --> 15:24.088
They ain't zero.

15:24.832 --> 15:25.924
(shaky sigh)

15:26.000 --> 15:28.651
Now, that was a long time ago.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.386
And I was very different then.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.838
Were you?

15:32.915 --> 15:35.658
Hell, I wasn't even me
till I met you.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.311
Judd, I know you had
a past before we met.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.359
I know I shouldn't be mad.

15:46.171 --> 15:47.837
But I am, Judd.

15:47.855 --> 15:49.447
And I can't help it.

15:50.891 --> 15:52.191
That's fair.

15:52.268 --> 15:54.177
GRACE: It's not fair.

15:54.195 --> 15:55.995
Who's it fair to?

15:56.864 --> 15:58.105
It's not fair to you.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.124
You didn't know you had
a son out there.

16:02.187 --> 16:04.587
That kid had to grow up
without his dad.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.173
It's not fair to him.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.710
It's not fair to me.

16:10.862 --> 16:13.287
(Grace crying)

16:13.364 --> 16:15.264
It's not fair to our daughter.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.202
From the day I met you, Judd,

16:19.220 --> 16:22.522
all I wanted to do was
have children with you.

16:24.467 --> 16:25.725
A family.

16:25.801 --> 16:27.835
And I find out you have...

16:27.837 --> 16:29.529
(crying)

16:34.327 --> 16:35.476
I know it's not rational,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.453
I don't need
anybody to tell me.

16:39.407 --> 16:41.057
But I can't barely look at you.

16:41.059 --> 16:43.418
Don't say that to me, Grace.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.987
Whatev... Whatever happens,

16:47.081 --> 16:49.257
it ain't gonna
affect our family.

16:50.902 --> 16:52.659
(softly):
Yes, it is.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.430
(Charlie crying)

16:57.075 --> 16:59.017
It's okay, baby,
mommy's comin'.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.229
(crying continues)

17:10.346 --> 17:11.771
So I just wanted you to know

17:11.847 --> 17:16.016
that I heard you the other day,
I mean, really heard you,

17:16.094 --> 17:18.018
so I'm gonna take your advice

17:18.096 --> 17:19.370
and I'm gonna
make a connection

17:19.447 --> 17:21.873
before I...
make a connection.

17:22.024 --> 17:23.599
-I'm proud of you, Cap.
-OWEN: Right?

17:23.618 --> 17:26.377
So there's this girl,
Becky from Round Rock.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.379
She's beautiful. She's smart.

17:28.456 --> 17:31.007
She likes hiking
and college football.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.126
Is she younger? Yes.

17:34.279 --> 17:35.628
But not by decades.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.904
-That's great.
-Right?

17:36.906 --> 17:38.464
And so we've been
texting all day.

17:38.541 --> 17:41.559
And what does it mean
when she sends me

17:41.710 --> 17:45.396
a video game controller
and a movie camera?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.717
It means she wants
a video of your junk.

17:50.795 --> 17:53.887
Um, Cap, how exactly
did you meet this person?

17:53.965 --> 17:55.389
On a, on a, on a dating app.

17:55.466 --> 17:56.557
A dating app?

17:56.634 --> 17:58.559
That's what you got
out of our conversation,

17:58.636 --> 18:00.286
that you should join
a dating app?

18:01.897 --> 18:03.564
-Which app?
-Plow.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.731
Plow? Cap!

18:04.809 --> 18:06.900
No! Plow's a garbage app.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.235
Look, Becky from Round Rock

18:08.254 --> 18:10.313
could be Boris from Moscow
trying to blackmail you.

18:10.315 --> 18:12.090
(sighs) You know,
I knew it was weird

18:12.166 --> 18:13.740
that she wanted to know
the names

18:13.818 --> 18:15.093
of all my childhood pets.

18:15.169 --> 18:18.154
You need to change all
of your passwords immediately.

18:18.156 --> 18:20.506
Look, if you wanna use
a dating app,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.916
you can't be using
one of these bottom feeders.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.085
You think Ben Affleck
would be caught dead on Plow?

18:25.163 --> 18:27.012
What would Ben Affleck
be caught dead on?

18:27.089 --> 18:29.165
-He's on Ascent.
-What's Ascent?

18:29.183 --> 18:31.091
It's an app for all the VIP's
and movie stars.

18:31.169 --> 18:32.944
Channing Tatum's on it.
So's Drew Barrymore.

18:33.020 --> 18:34.946
Well... they don't need
a dating app.

18:35.097 --> 18:36.689
Exactly.

18:36.841 --> 18:40.284
A dating app for people
who don't need dating apps.

18:40.436 --> 18:42.528
I love it!
How do I sign up?

18:42.680 --> 18:43.621
Sign up?

18:44.031 --> 18:45.698
You can't sign up for Ascent.
You gotta get invited.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.183
Okay, well,
how do I get invited?

18:47.276 --> 18:50.202
You can't. Look, you need
a celebrity or an influencer

18:50.355 --> 18:53.047
with millions of followers
to vouch for you.

18:54.584 --> 18:56.134
How many millions?

18:56.970 --> 19:00.045
(funky music playing)

19:00.198 --> 19:02.198
This fattoush salad
is out of control.

19:02.216 --> 19:03.624
Now, where did you learn

19:03.643 --> 19:05.217
how to make
all this Lebanese food?

19:05.370 --> 19:08.295
Oh, I've... been a fan
of Levantine food for years.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.556
He watched like nine
YouTube cooking videos today.

19:10.708 --> 19:11.965
That's so sweet.

19:12.043 --> 19:13.559
You didn't have to go through
all that trouble.

19:13.636 --> 19:14.819
Oh, no, he did.

19:14.896 --> 19:16.154
No trouble.
It was no trouble at all.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.305
I-I just realized
that I'd been remiss

19:18.324 --> 19:21.050
in not inviting the one person
who saved the 126

19:21.052 --> 19:24.495
to break bread
or gluten-free pita

19:24.647 --> 19:25.997
and say thank you.

19:29.985 --> 19:31.711
So what's the ask?

19:32.397 --> 19:33.078
There's no ask.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.672
He wants you
to get him on Ascent.

19:34.749 --> 19:36.823
I... I was getting to that.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.158
Ascent, like the dating app?

19:38.178 --> 19:41.328
-Mateo says you're on it.
-Yeah.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.922
I mean, I never really use it,

19:43.074 --> 19:44.256
but it's fun to see
who's on there.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.333
So would you put in
a good word for me?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.186
(winces)

19:48.337 --> 19:50.429
We're talking about
my street cred here.

19:50.581 --> 19:53.432
You know, you rate
your dates on the app.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.008
So if I get you on there

19:55.028 --> 19:58.421
and you go all One Night Strand
on someone,

19:58.423 --> 20:00.347
that-that could blow back on me.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.532
That is a very hurtful moniker.

20:01.684 --> 20:03.367
Marj, come on,
have some mercy on him, okay?

20:03.444 --> 20:04.869
-He's desperate.
-Yeah... Uh...

20:05.020 --> 20:06.445
Uh, I'm not desperate.

20:06.597 --> 20:09.207
I mean, John Cusack's
on the app.

20:09.283 --> 20:10.766
I'm cooler than John Cusack.

20:10.768 --> 20:11.709
Way cooler.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.118
Well, John Cusack now.

20:13.271 --> 20:14.286
Yeah. Okay.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.456
You get me on there,
no kitchen duty for two weeks.

20:17.533 --> 20:18.958
Bribery?

20:19.034 --> 20:20.443
I thought you knew me
better than that.

20:20.461 --> 20:22.428
Okay, no kitchen duty
for two months.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.205
-Done.
-Yeah.

20:25.283 --> 20:26.432
(Marjan chuckles)

20:27.894 --> 20:30.544
(indistinct chatter)

20:30.563 --> 20:32.713
Excuse me. Have you seen
Detective Washington?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.148
No, I'm sorry.

20:36.794 --> 20:38.194
(sighs)

20:43.243 --> 20:46.577
(jazzy music playing)

20:54.328 --> 20:56.254
SARINA: What are you doing?

20:56.330 --> 20:57.964
Nothing, I was just...

20:59.908 --> 21:01.092
straightening the clutter.

21:01.168 --> 21:03.928
Oh, there's no clutter.
That's my system.

21:04.005 --> 21:05.263
Sorry.

21:06.415 --> 21:09.842
I was just leaving, uh... this.

21:09.918 --> 21:11.494
I pulled up all the traffic cam

21:11.512 --> 21:13.253
within two miles
of Katie Conrad's home

21:13.347 --> 21:15.664
around the time of the fire.

21:15.683 --> 21:17.942
Um, I've been running plates.

21:18.019 --> 21:19.610
Got through
about a third of them.

21:19.762 --> 21:22.521
That must have taken hours.

21:22.598 --> 21:25.616
It's no trouble. I've been
doing it on my own time.

21:25.693 --> 21:28.286
There's a note in there
explaining everything.

21:28.437 --> 21:30.288
I'll just get out of your way.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.291
Officer Reyes.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.293
Why don't you come have a seat?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.378
Come on.

21:40.708 --> 21:44.376
So I've been doing some digging
into that theory of yours

21:44.529 --> 21:47.305
that Katie knew her abductor.

21:48.791 --> 21:49.882
You agree?

21:50.034 --> 21:52.018
I do and I don't.

21:53.054 --> 21:55.479
Katie had a nanny cam
in her room.

21:55.556 --> 21:57.206
It was destroyed in the fire.

21:57.299 --> 21:59.892
But we pulled the footage
that was stored on the cloud.

22:00.044 --> 22:01.444
Take a look at this.

22:03.047 --> 22:05.731
MR. WHISPERS (over nanny cam):
<i> Katie? Katie?</i>

22:05.883 --> 22:07.566
<i> Wake up.</i>

22:07.718 --> 22:08.734
<i> It's time to play.</i>

22:08.886 --> 22:10.736
KATIE:
<i> Not tonight, Mr. Whispers.</i>

22:10.888 --> 22:14.332
MR. WHISPERS:
<i> Aw. But don't you</i>
<i> wanna play with me?</i>

22:15.001 --> 22:17.560
<i> I got you a present.</i>

22:17.578 --> 22:20.563
She-she talked
about Mr. Whispers.

22:20.565 --> 22:23.657
I thought it was
her imaginary friend. How...

22:23.676 --> 22:25.918
Well, it seems someone
hacked into your nanny cam.

22:26.070 --> 22:28.070
Do you recognize that voice?

22:28.072 --> 22:29.162
-No.
-No, no.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.848
I've never heard it
before in my life.

22:30.925 --> 22:33.592
Whoever this is
took our daughter?

22:33.744 --> 22:35.744
It's likely, yes.

22:35.746 --> 22:39.081
Do you ever share your
Wi-Fi passwords with anyone?

22:39.100 --> 22:43.510
Friends, neighbors,
maybe workers at the house?

22:43.529 --> 22:45.321
(sighs) Yeah, sure.

22:46.849 --> 22:50.868
We, uh, we redid our kitchen,
our master bath last year.

22:51.095 --> 22:54.113
We gave it out
to the whole crew.

22:54.189 --> 22:57.541
Troy, we have the password
written on the router.

22:57.693 --> 22:59.768
We have parties,

22:59.770 --> 23:01.194
people over all the time.

23:01.272 --> 23:02.788
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

23:02.865 --> 23:07.093
Start with the first name you
can remember and go from there.

23:08.946 --> 23:10.721
Mrs. Conrad?

23:10.798 --> 23:15.142
Do you remember when Katie first
mentioned her imaginary friend?

23:16.137 --> 23:18.145
I don't know, but...

23:20.048 --> 23:23.234
He'd been talking to her
for months.

23:28.799 --> 23:30.533
(kids talking indistinctly)

23:31.636 --> 23:33.819
(Charlie coos)

23:33.896 --> 23:35.729
What you thinkin' on so hard?

23:35.748 --> 23:38.332
(Judd inhales and exhales)

23:39.810 --> 23:43.003
Kids growing up
without their daddies, I guess.

23:43.906 --> 23:46.048
And somehow they make do.

23:47.543 --> 23:49.075
Okay.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.430
You're gonna get
a paternity test, right?

23:52.657 --> 23:55.599
(clears throat) Tommy, if I did
it would just be a formality.

23:55.792 --> 23:57.751
That kid's mine.

23:57.828 --> 23:59.562
Well, how can you be so sure?

24:01.107 --> 24:03.607
Because I am.

24:03.759 --> 24:07.611
Well, Gracie says you don't ever
remember even meeting the...

24:07.688 --> 24:10.448
Okay, well, then
that's not quite accurate.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.191
JUDD: Well, hang on now.

24:12.343 --> 24:13.358
I remember what happened.

24:13.511 --> 24:15.694
I remember how she made me feel.

24:15.771 --> 24:17.513
Was she special to you?

24:17.515 --> 24:19.698
She was...

24:19.792 --> 24:22.201
for one night.
It was... yeah.

24:22.277 --> 24:25.020
She was the prettiest thing
you ever saw on a quarter horse.

24:25.022 --> 24:29.024
And she had just won, uh,
first prize in the barrel race.

24:29.043 --> 24:31.210
-Mm.
-And she came
strutting into this bar

24:31.286 --> 24:33.119
where me and my brothers
Sam and Nate were at,

24:33.139 --> 24:34.621
we were just getting drunk.

24:34.699 --> 24:38.309
She walks right up to me
and grabbed me by my bolo tie.

24:38.536 --> 24:39.477
Oh...

24:40.629 --> 24:42.221
She pulled me out
to the parking lot,

24:42.297 --> 24:45.541
and, you know, I'm 22 years old
with a mouth full of marbles

24:45.559 --> 24:47.968
going, "Okay."

24:48.062 --> 24:49.487
How am I supposed to say no?

24:49.638 --> 24:51.714
Hell, I don't know
if I would have said no.

24:51.732 --> 24:53.048
(Tommy chuckles)

24:53.050 --> 24:55.642
And, uh, protection
wasn't a thing.

24:55.736 --> 25:00.222
She was older, so I figured
she had that taken care of.

25:00.224 --> 25:02.908
Oh, yeah, you really
were a dumb kid.

25:03.060 --> 25:06.295
I thought I had
a few more years before
I screwed up this whole...

25:08.749 --> 25:10.082
being a daddy thing.

25:10.234 --> 25:12.843
You didn't screw up a thing.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.678
But you are gonna do
what's right.

25:14.830 --> 25:16.347
Yeah.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.500
The problem is,
how do I do this right

25:20.520 --> 25:22.478
without hurting
the woman I love?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.917
KATIE (on video):<i> Aah.</i>

25:28.919 --> 25:30.419
<i> This is the one that's loose.</i>

25:30.437 --> 25:34.273
MR. WHISPERS (on video):
<i> Oh, wow! Katie-cat, I see it.</i>

25:34.425 --> 25:36.516
<i> -You know what this means?</i>
<i> -What?</i>

25:36.594 --> 25:40.538
MR. WHISPERS:
<i> Somebody is gonna get</i>
<i> a visit from the tooth fairy.</i>

25:40.614 --> 25:42.614
(audio rewinding)

25:42.691 --> 25:44.283
KATIE:<i> Aah.</i>

25:44.435 --> 25:46.544
<i> This is the one that's loose.</i>

25:46.620 --> 25:49.454
MR. WHISPERS:<i> Oh, wow!</i>
<i> Katie-cat, I see it.</i>

25:49.607 --> 25:50.697
-Oh!
-Sorry, sorry.

25:50.775 --> 25:52.883
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. Sorry.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.885
You're not the scary one.

25:55.037 --> 25:58.371
Baby, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Will you come back to bed?

25:58.465 --> 26:00.132
Uh...

26:00.226 --> 26:02.434
Not sure I could sleep
even if I did.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.395
This is...

26:05.731 --> 26:07.314
This is kind of terrifying.

26:09.476 --> 26:10.526
Scoot over.

26:16.817 --> 26:19.392
What exactly are we looking for?

26:19.412 --> 26:21.912
Anything that can
help us identify
who might be behind this.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.415
TK:
How do we know it's not just
some Russian hackers?

26:24.566 --> 26:26.900
Hackers don't usually
kidnap children,

26:26.919 --> 26:29.569
especially without
a ransom demand.

26:29.663 --> 26:31.255
You'll see, this feels...

26:33.593 --> 26:35.000
different.

26:35.077 --> 26:36.076
(key clicks)

26:36.262 --> 26:39.096

26:39.323 --> 26:43.508
MR. WHISPERS:
<i> Of course, you are.</i>
<i> It'll be fun.</i>

26:43.661 --> 26:45.010
<i> I don't know.</i>

26:45.104 --> 26:48.439
MR. WHISPERS:
<i> Katie. Do what I say.</i>

26:49.925 --> 26:51.892
<i> That's a good girl.</i>

26:52.002 --> 26:53.777
That is so messed up.

26:53.854 --> 26:55.095
He's grooming her.

KATIE:<i> Thank you.</i>

27:06.517 --> 27:08.016

27:13.357 --> 27:15.615
<i> Good night, Mr. Whispers.</i>

27:15.635 --> 27:18.451

Oh, my God!

27:59.737 --> 28:01.920
What? What? What?

28:01.997 --> 28:03.472
I think I know who did this.

28:05.426 --> 28:08.427
<i> Don't forget to pour some</i>
<i> for your guests too,</i>
<i> Katie-cat.</i>

28:08.429 --> 28:11.063
<i> Sorry, Otto.</i>
<i> Sorry, Bun-Bun.</i>

28:12.692 --> 28:14.099
Her name is Danica Hendry.

28:14.251 --> 28:16.509
She was Katie's nanny
until last year.

28:16.587 --> 28:18.511
Right. The Conrads said
she moved out of state

28:18.531 --> 28:20.255
to be with family
during the pandemic.

28:20.257 --> 28:21.757
CARLOS: She did.

28:21.759 --> 28:24.201
Until she rented an apartment
in Austin two months ago,

28:24.352 --> 28:27.095
the same time the voice
started on the nanny cam,

28:27.097 --> 28:31.616
and she's the only person
who calls Katie "Katie-cat."

28:31.693 --> 28:34.770
Her accomplice must have
picked it up from her.

28:34.788 --> 28:36.029
There's an accomplice now?

28:36.106 --> 28:38.507
Well, the voice on the nanny cam
is a male voice.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.218
Except it's not.

28:41.295 --> 28:43.387
Digital Forensics
just sent this to me.

28:43.538 --> 28:46.581
The unsub
was using an audio filter.

28:46.633 --> 28:47.799
This is what we heard.

28:47.876 --> 28:51.119
MALE VOICE (over tape):
<i> Katie? Katie?</i>

28:51.121 --> 28:54.565
<i> Wake up. It's time to play.</i>

28:54.716 --> 28:56.883
And this is without the filter.

28:56.902 --> 29:00.386
FEMALE VOICE:<i> Katie? Katie?</i>

29:00.464 --> 29:03.574
<i> Wake up. It's time to play.</i>

29:03.725 --> 29:04.891
That's her.

29:04.969 --> 29:06.910
I'll see if forensics
can make a match.

29:07.029 --> 29:08.303
I wouldn't wait for that.

29:08.322 --> 29:09.988
Officer Reyes, I'm gonna need

29:09.990 --> 29:12.065
more than a lady's voice
on a nanny cam

29:12.084 --> 29:14.334
to get a judge
to issue a warrant.

29:15.162 --> 29:16.587
There's also this.

29:18.573 --> 29:20.257
Remember
the traffic cams I pulled?

29:20.484 --> 29:21.550
SARINA: Mm-hmm.

29:23.837 --> 29:27.914
This is Danica Hendry's jeep
leaving Katie's neighborhood

29:27.992 --> 29:30.392
two minutes
after the fire started.

29:32.663 --> 29:34.679
SARINA: Austin PD!

29:34.756 --> 29:35.847
OFFICER 1: Anyone here?

29:35.924 --> 29:36.999
Quick, check the back room.

29:37.017 --> 29:38.667
Go, go, go, on your right!

29:38.685 --> 29:40.093
OFFICER 2: Move, move, move.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.837
OFFICER 1:
This is the police.

29:41.855 --> 29:42.671
Show yourself if you're here.

29:42.689 --> 29:44.114
OFFICER 2: Closet's clear.

29:44.508 --> 29:46.358
-OFFICER 1:
Check under this bed.
-OFFICER 3: This room's clear.

29:46.434 --> 29:47.600
OFFICER 4: No sign of anyone.

29:47.694 --> 29:49.077
OFFICER 2: Bedroom's clear.

29:49.771 --> 29:50.770
House is clear.

29:50.848 --> 29:52.146
We must have
just missed Danica.

29:52.182 --> 29:55.517
Stuff in the dry rack
is still wet.

29:55.536 --> 29:57.443
Wherever Danica went,
she took Katie with her.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.545
She was here.

30:00.115 --> 30:02.448
That's the rabbit
from the video.

30:02.468 --> 30:06.878
Alright. I want two
unmarked units on this house
in case they come back

30:07.031 --> 30:09.364
and put an Amber Alert
on Danica's jeep.

30:09.366 --> 30:11.291
Let's just hope
we didn't miss our chance.

30:11.368 --> 30:13.393
(indistinct chatter)

30:14.814 --> 30:16.555
(Katie crying)

30:16.631 --> 30:18.982
Don't cry, sweetie.

30:19.059 --> 30:21.801
You're getting ice cream
for dinner.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.488
I don't want ice cream.
I want my mommy.

30:25.883 --> 30:28.742
I'm going to be your mommy now.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.385
Remember?

30:30.404 --> 30:32.120
SERVER: What can I get you?

30:33.148 --> 30:36.667
Can we get two sundaes with...

30:36.743 --> 30:38.001
Chocolate or caramel, honey?

30:38.153 --> 30:39.819
(voice breaking):
Chocolate.

30:39.897 --> 30:42.422
DANICA:
Chocolate. Extra sprinkles.

30:43.734 --> 30:45.425
(cell phone chimes)

30:48.496 --> 30:49.388
No.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.390
KATIE (crying):
I wanna go home.

30:52.593 --> 30:54.434
Shut up! Just shut up!

30:56.930 --> 30:58.272
(tires screeching)

31:04.938 --> 31:07.531
I have been wanting to
come to this restaurant
since I got into town,

31:07.682 --> 31:09.682
I can't believe
you got a table so easily.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.260
My boss comes here all the time.

31:12.262 --> 31:15.113
They never know if I'm making
a reservation for him or myself.

31:15.190 --> 31:17.949
Your boss being
the governor of Texas.

31:18.102 --> 31:19.434
That's right.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.787
Well, so Deputy Chief of Staff,
that must be really exciting.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.456
If your idea of excitement

31:24.532 --> 31:27.700
is red-lining speeches
about stagflation.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.386
Bet you put out more fires
a day than I do.

31:29.463 --> 31:32.130
-(chuckles)
-So I always imagine
the world of politics

31:32.207 --> 31:36.226
to be really smart people
walking briskly down corridors,

31:36.378 --> 31:38.929
talking real fast and all
sort of sounding alike.

31:39.081 --> 31:40.880
I-I don't know about smart,

31:40.958 --> 31:43.883
but there are definitely
some fast talkers.

31:43.903 --> 31:47.963
(cell phones vibrating)

31:47.981 --> 31:50.298
-Oh, Amber Alert.
-OWEN: Wow.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.241
Something wrong?

31:51.485 --> 31:53.559
No, it's related to a call
we had recently.

31:53.637 --> 31:56.138
It was an arson
and the girl went missing.

31:56.156 --> 31:57.989
-I heard about that case.
-Yeah.

31:58.066 --> 32:00.417
Poor thing. I hope
they get her back safe.

32:00.494 --> 32:01.501
Me too.

32:02.496 --> 32:04.087
So your profile says

32:04.239 --> 32:08.483
you like hot yoga,
Art Deco, and Scorsese?

32:08.485 --> 32:10.318
So do I.
We like the same things.

32:10.337 --> 32:13.488
-I mean, what are the odds?
-Pretty decent, actually.

32:13.507 --> 32:17.008
Ascent has the best
algorithm on the market.

32:17.161 --> 32:19.603
Right. So what's your favorite
Scorsese movie?

32:19.754 --> 32:21.513
I know this sounds sacrilegious,

32:21.665 --> 32:24.942
but probably
<i> Wolf of Wall Street.</i>

32:25.018 --> 32:26.592
I love<i> Wolf of Wall Street.</i>

32:26.670 --> 32:28.186
-You do?
-Oh, yeah.

32:28.338 --> 32:30.522
And we're supposed to say
<i> Raging Bull</i> or<i> Taxi Driver,</i>

32:30.598 --> 32:33.158
-but those movies are so...
-BOTH: Grim.

32:34.194 --> 32:35.452
Did that just happen?

32:35.603 --> 32:37.770
I believe it did.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.364
<i> Wolf</i> just has style.

32:39.441 --> 32:41.607
-Yeah, and swagger.
-Yes.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.518
Yes, so much swagger.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.446
I... If it weren't for
Matthew McConaughey
stinking it up,

32:46.523 --> 32:48.757
it would be the perfect movie.

32:49.893 --> 32:51.042
You don't like
Matthew McConaughey?

32:51.195 --> 32:54.346
Let's just say I am not a fan.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.123
Oh, God,
he's-he's not like your

32:57.142 --> 32:58.883
golfing buddy
or something, is he?

32:59.036 --> 33:01.052
No, no, no. I mean,
that would be awesome.

33:01.205 --> 33:03.647
He's the finest actor
of his generation.

33:03.798 --> 33:05.357
(laughs)

33:06.727 --> 33:09.878
Oh! You're-you're serious.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.732
Uh, we'll have to agree
to disagree on that one.

33:13.808 --> 33:14.716
Yeah.

33:14.809 --> 33:17.643
-Eh, it's all subjective.
-Hmm.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.887
(Catherine chuckles)

33:18.889 --> 33:20.998
That's what makes a horse race.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.150
Have you seen
<i> Dallas Buyers Club?</i>

33:24.228 --> 33:26.077
I tried twice.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.230
It's just like, we get it, dude.

33:28.248 --> 33:31.324
You only ate one can of tuna
every day for a month.

33:31.401 --> 33:36.096
I... I just find his acting
a little pretentious.

33:37.165 --> 33:39.424
Well, if by pretentious,
you mean...

33:39.576 --> 33:41.184
absolutely
not pretentious at all.

33:41.261 --> 33:43.411
I mean, the man is
the antithesis of pretentious.

33:43.413 --> 33:44.596
-He's genuine.
-(laughs)

33:44.748 --> 33:46.039
Why?

33:46.116 --> 33:47.858
Because he says,
"Alright, alright, alright,"

33:48.009 --> 33:49.860
and he plays
the bongos naked?

33:50.053 --> 33:52.446
-Partly.
-Pure shtick.

33:54.775 --> 33:55.774
I know what this is all about.

33:55.926 --> 33:57.034
-You... You do?
-Yeah.

33:57.110 --> 33:59.369
You're scared
he's gonna run for governor.

33:59.446 --> 34:03.040
And then you and your boss
would be out of a job.

34:03.116 --> 34:05.858
You know, based on tonight,
I think he might have my vote.

34:05.936 --> 34:07.435
Sounds like he had it before.

34:07.454 --> 34:09.195
No, no, no. I would
never have voted for him

34:09.214 --> 34:11.273
because that would have
only corrupted him

34:11.275 --> 34:12.457
and take him off the screen.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.368
Since you put it that way,
he might have my vote.

34:15.445 --> 34:18.446
Okay! What can I get for you?

34:18.448 --> 34:20.206
-Just the check.
-Just the check, please.

34:20.284 --> 34:22.284
But you haven't
ordered anything.

34:22.302 --> 34:25.854

I just wanna say one thing
more before you go.

Hey, bad dates happen.

34:38.135 --> 34:39.743
Don't worry,

34:41.305 --> 34:44.748
Thank you. No, I was
just gonna say...

34:44.899 --> 34:47.084
Have you seen the first season
of<i> True Detective,</i>

34:47.235 --> 34:49.494

like him in that, then I--

35:03.918 --> 35:05.918
Call the cops,
he is stealing my car!

35:05.996 --> 35:07.495

Good. Put 'em on speaker.

35:20.177 --> 35:23.011
You think this is funny?
This is kidnapping.

35:23.013 --> 35:24.955
That's kidnapping.
This is carjacking.

35:25.106 --> 35:26.531
That's the jeep
from the Amber Alert.

37:33.159 --> 37:35.493
Yeah, why does that
not surprise me?

37:35.645 --> 37:39.089
I will say this,
it wasn't boring.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.649
I do know how to show a woman
a terrifying time.

I was asking.

-Thank you, Detective.
-Mm-hmm.

38:39.709 --> 38:43.302
Anyone ever tell you
you are a pushy bastard?

38:43.380 --> 38:45.713
Well, my boyfriend thinks
that I'm a control freak.

38:45.715 --> 38:48.366
(chuckles) He's not wrong.

38:49.719 --> 38:52.495
You ever think of
taking the detective exam?

38:55.559 --> 38:56.649
Really?

38:56.668 --> 38:58.150
Yeah, why not?

So what's the occasion?

39:28.925 --> 39:30.325
Family dinner.

39:32.262 --> 39:34.496
I say we got some things
to talk about, wouldn't you?

39:36.766 --> 39:38.691
Yeah.

39:38.785 --> 39:41.527
Yeah, I just didn't know
when we were gonna
get back around to that.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.029
Like, talkin'.

39:44.107 --> 39:45.957
You were right about
what you said, though, Judd.

39:46.033 --> 39:48.093
You are the same man
that I married.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.202
A good man.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.263
That's gonna do
right by that boy.

39:53.783 --> 39:54.799
That's your family, Judd,

39:54.951 --> 39:56.893
and that absolutely
makes him my family.

39:57.787 --> 39:59.712
(inhales and exhales deeply)

39:59.731 --> 40:02.957

that marrying you was...

40:02.976 --> 40:05.718
you know, by far
the smartest thing I ever did?

40:05.737 --> 40:09.531
Yeah, but to be fair,
you don't set the highest bar.

40:10.467 --> 40:11.741

40:11.893 --> 40:13.576
JUDD: Come here.

-GRACE: Love you.

No, sir, you are.

40:29.335 --> 40:30.301
Is...

-Howdy.

-Well, just come on in.
-MARLENE: Yeah, thank you.

40:46.427 --> 40:47.444
(door closes)

40:48.262 --> 40:50.095
-I'm Grace.
-Hey.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.531
GRACE: So...

40:54.027 --> 40:56.161
Thank you for agreeing
to come see us.

40:57.847 --> 40:59.330
MARLENE: I'll be honest.

41:00.684 --> 41:02.850
When you called and told me

41:02.869 --> 41:06.020
Wyatt had been out
to see y'all...

41:06.022 --> 41:07.964
my first instinct
was to tell you

41:08.041 --> 41:10.049
to throw away my son's number.

41:11.695 --> 41:12.710
Forget all about this.

41:12.862 --> 41:16.139
Pretend like it never happened.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.184
I understand. Well, um...

41:20.370 --> 41:22.395
We'll talk more
about it after we eat.

41:24.298 --> 41:25.982
Sorry, I-I just realized

41:26.209 --> 41:29.319
I-I... should have asked
if y'all even drink.

41:29.395 --> 41:31.303
No, no, don't worry about that.

41:31.381 --> 41:34.807
We do. We're gonna tonight.

41:34.884 --> 41:37.218
Why don't you
open the wine, Judd?
Let it breathe.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.220
JUDD:
Yeah, I'm gonna
let it breathe.

41:39.222 --> 41:42.081
We're all gonna
just breathe and...

41:42.817 --> 41:43.741
Good.

41:43.893 --> 41:45.484
Y'all really do have
a lovely home.

41:45.562 --> 41:47.152
Thank you.

41:47.230 --> 41:50.155
-Why don't you sit down?
-I'm sorry if...

41:50.233 --> 41:52.750
(sighs) ...if what I said
came off rude.

41:52.902 --> 41:54.752
I just...

41:54.904 --> 41:56.179
When it comes to my son,

41:56.330 --> 42:01.000
I think I may be a little...
overprotective.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.761
You know, Wyatt's always
been a sensitive kid.

42:03.913 --> 42:05.438
Always led with his heart.

42:08.009 --> 42:09.751
I need you to understand

42:09.753 --> 42:11.919
that I love that boy

42:12.013 --> 42:14.847
more than anything
in this world.

42:14.924 --> 42:19.110
And I'll do anything
to keep him from gettin' hurt.

42:19.262 --> 42:21.746
Believe me, I know
exactly how you feel.

42:23.524 --> 42:25.708
(Charlie cooing)

42:25.785 --> 42:26.709
(cork pops)

42:26.861 --> 42:29.087
So who's-who's this?

42:30.940 --> 42:33.341
This is our daughter. Charlie.

42:34.944 --> 42:37.262
She really is so precious,
isn't she?

42:40.541 --> 42:42.875
Do you wanna hold her?

42:42.894 --> 42:46.020
Yeah, I... I would love to,
thank you.

42:52.478 --> 42:53.886
(chuckles)

42:53.963 --> 42:55.530
Hello, darlin'.

42:56.724 --> 42:58.724
Oh, she's beautiful.

42:58.802 --> 43:00.243
Hi, darlin'.

43:01.562 --> 43:02.745
Thank you.
