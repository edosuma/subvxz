00:07.241 --> 00:08.607
Jessi: Some of the best
days I've ever had in my

00:08.642 --> 00:10.642
entire life are out here.

00:10.678 --> 00:14.446
There is an
amazing gorgeousness,

00:16.250 --> 00:18.984
and it's delicate.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.487
It looks like something
out of a fairytale.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.224
But things do happen out here.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.029
Sometimes you can see
the absolute viciousness

00:30.064 --> 00:31.697
of the cosna.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.934
It is an unmovable force
and you have got to get out

00:35.970 --> 00:37.903
of the way to survive out here.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.572
Chris: I'm cut. I'm cut.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.242
I'm flayed open, man.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.246
I need evac.
I'm in bad shape.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.251
Jessi: I'm here.
Chris: I'm close.
Jessi: I see you.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.286
Chris: Don't look
at the wound, jess.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.921
It's to the bone.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.557
It ain't gonna stop
unless we go full tourniquet.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.163
Pain is weakness
leaving the body.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.964
I can handle anything.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.333
I can handle anything.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.103
Oh, it's so close.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.139
Have to focus on tomorrow.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.509
I'm just gonna pass
out for a minute.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.678
Crew: No. Do not pass
out for a minute, chris.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.280
Stay with me.

01:29.990 --> 01:35.461
♪ ♪

01:36.630 --> 01:38.764
chris: There we go.
Look at this damn tire.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.835
Hopefully, it holds.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.071
It is what it is.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.573
To go get firewood this year,

01:47.608 --> 01:49.842
we're gonna have to go farther
than we've ever gone before.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.844
The old woodyard,
it's just decimated.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.079
We've taken all the
dead standing out of it.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.148
Right now, it's
dipping down into freezing

01:56.183 --> 01:57.416
temperatures at night.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.884
Last year we started
running out of wood.

01:58.919 --> 02:02.087
So, this year, we feel like
we really need to start early.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.356
I don't just want to
survive and grit my teeth

02:04.391 --> 02:06.225
through the winter.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.962
Jessi: Hey, love.
Chris: Hey, how's it going?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.897
Jessi: Got everything set
up to go find some wood?

02:11.932 --> 02:14.633
Chris: Yeah, the back
tire is leaking really bad.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.202
Jessi: This one?

02:17.238 --> 02:19.738
Chris: I put some duct tape
on it to slow the leak down.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.274
Ooh, my brake
just disconnected.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.642
Jessi: I knew that.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.711
Chris: Let me get that fixed.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.778
Jessi: Have your gun?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.347
Chris: I got the bear gun.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.116
Jessi: Um, I figured you
should probably take a walkie

02:31.152 --> 02:35.187
with you, so if you get into
anything or you need help.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.389
Chris: Once an hour, you'll
hear from me just so you know

02:37.424 --> 02:38.790
that I'm safe and let
me show you where I'm

02:38.826 --> 02:39.992
going on the map.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.560
This is where
our old woodyard was,

02:41.595 --> 02:42.594
is right in here,

02:42.630 --> 02:43.962
and we haven't been
past the swamp.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.998
But I think if we
cut up into the trees,

02:46.033 --> 02:47.699
it looks really
wooded up in here.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.602
Jessi: Okay, so you're
gonna head up there and

02:50.638 --> 02:51.570
check it out.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.471
Chris: Yup.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.639
Jessi: And then,
you're headed back.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.940
Chris:
If worse comes to worse.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.109
If I'm hurt, or if, um,

02:57.144 --> 02:58.911
you don't hear from
me in a few hours,

02:58.946 --> 03:01.713
if it's just totally
silent, please come for me.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.049
Jessi: Okay.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.552
Chris: Okay? Oh, man.
That's a long ways out there.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.453
All right, love.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.488
Give me a hug?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.957
And I'll see you
in a couple hours.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.228
Jessi: I hope you find
a lot, abundance of wood and

03:16.430 --> 03:17.663
you have an easy trip.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.899
Chris: Me too.
Jessi: Love you.
Chris: Love you.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.213
Kaleb: Out here, preparation
is a lot different than what

03:34.248 --> 03:36.448
most people perceive.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.650
We look forward to what
needs to be accomplished

03:38.686 --> 03:40.419
for the next season.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.954
It's hard in the winter.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.389
You don't want
problems to arise.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.268
Brittany: Why are we
bringing both tarps?

03:56.303 --> 03:57.803
Kaleb: This
goes under the tent,

03:57.838 --> 04:00.339
so the floor of the
tent don't get wet at night,

04:00.374 --> 04:02.441
and the other one
is to put stuff over.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.909
Elovie: Dad, what we doing?

04:03.944 --> 04:06.245
Kaleb: We are going
to my wood lot,

04:06.280 --> 04:07.813
where we're gonna get
a bunch of wood ready for

04:07.848 --> 04:09.815
next winter when I can
go there on a snow machine,

04:09.883 --> 04:11.750
and we're gonna camp overnight.

04:11.785 --> 04:12.684
Isn't that fun?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.819
Elovie: Yeah.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.287
Brittany: We haven't gotten
to go camping in a while

04:15.322 --> 04:16.455
as a family.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.557
Elovie: That will be so fun.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.225
Kaleb: Let's get everything
loaded up so we can go.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.495
My wood lot is the outflow
of a creek where there's

04:23.530 --> 04:25.163
lots of spruce trees.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.467
They're all fallen down and
all of the limbs and stuff

04:28.502 --> 04:31.169
freeze into the ground and it
makes it difficult to pull the

04:31.205 --> 04:33.071
wood out of the forest.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.741
So, what we need to do is
completely delimb the trees.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.743
That way, when I come
in with a snow machine in

04:37.778 --> 04:39.878
the middle of winter,
it's easy to pull them out.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.413
Piper, load up.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.382
Brittany: Good girl. Yeah.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.549
Kaleb: Good girl.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.019
All right, gilbert and
ellie, both climb in there.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.755
Being able to load my
family into the air plane and

04:49.790 --> 04:52.357
fly over glaciers,
get to chat a little bit.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.226
It's my happy place.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.162
I love getting out
and seeing what all the

04:57.197 --> 04:59.398
world has to show.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.334
Brittany:
All righty, ready to go?

05:02.369 --> 05:04.036
Kaleb: I am ready to go.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.270
Elovie: Me too!

05:05.306 --> 05:06.905
Brittany:
I can't watch this part.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.507
It always makes me so nervous.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.910
Kaleb: Nothing to
be nervous about.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.845
Brittany: Really?

05:13.881 --> 05:14.946
Kaleb: Yup.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.448
Brittany: Like, I shouldn't
be nervous about your

05:16.483 --> 05:17.716
arm getting chopped
off or something?

05:20.387 --> 05:22.154
Brittany: But what if it did?

05:25.926 --> 05:29.361
Kaleb: Mccarthy is an
aviation community.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.431
Over 50% of the residents
here fly to some degree.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.334
And as soon as I was
big enough to fly one,

05:35.369 --> 05:37.969
I was in one, and I just
fell in love with it.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.105
<i> Brittany (over radio):</i>
<i> Look at that glacier, ellie.</i>

05:40.140 --> 05:41.973
<i> Isn't that amazing?</i>

05:42.009 --> 05:43.842
<i> Glacier!</i>

05:44.178 --> 05:48.714
Kaleb:
The access that airplanes
provide is just unbeatable.

05:49.750 --> 05:55.153
<i> Brittany (over radio):</i>
<i> Hang on. Good job.</i>

06:02.529 --> 06:05.263
Alex: Muscle power is my
renewable resource I prefer,

06:05.299 --> 06:07.733
because it's clean,
it's reliable,

06:07.768 --> 06:11.002
and even a dummy like
me can use his body.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.180
Alex: Sipsey. Hey, come here.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.183
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.256
So today, I'm headed back down
to my new plot of land because

06:31.291 --> 06:34.993
my next big project is I
need to build a new cabin.

06:35.429 --> 06:38.296
My cabin here, it's pretty
far from anything else.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.735
Getting water and hauling
these supplies up to my cabin

06:43.771 --> 06:45.537
is a big problem.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.507
So that's why I bought a
plot of land that is half the

06:48.542 --> 06:50.642
distance closer to the water.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.544
It's also a flatter land.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.379
I want to build
a cabin that'll really be

06:54.415 --> 06:56.114
nice to live in.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.418
<i> Narrator: Alex javor is</i>
<i> taking his first steps to</i>

06:59.453 --> 07:01.153
<i> build his dream cabin.</i>

07:01.188 --> 07:02.320
Alex: Come on, sipsey.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.122
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> But with winter looming,</i>

07:04.158 --> 07:06.024

07:06.059 --> 07:08.894
<i> the landscape making</i>
<i> any progress impossible.</i>

07:09.897 --> 07:11.196
Alex: Here's my hunting cabin.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.864
It's a shelter,
but it's not a home.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.199
It's not a permanent thing.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.469
This is basically the spot I
want to put my, uh, new cabin.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.938
The problem is, here,
there's no big trees.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.741
I need big trees to
build a cabin from.

07:25.012 --> 07:28.046
I wanted to build a log cabin.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.314
The bigger the log is,

07:29.349 --> 07:31.149
the more insulation
you have.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.618
Too big and I can't
handle it myself.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.354
I need something, probably
six to eight inches and I just

07:36.390 --> 07:38.056
don't have that here.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.625
But I found a place with
lots of great cabin trees.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.127
It's not very far away.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.063
I just gotta figure out how
I'm gonna get the logs here.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.732
Yeah, there's a
good cabin tree.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.167
There's one. There's one.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.569
These ones are not.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.971
They're all big, they're
tall, they're straight.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.006
The major problem
is this hill.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.274
It's pretty steep.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.577
I'll never carry a
log by hand up it.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.178
You know, I don't think
the world's strongest man

08:00.214 --> 08:01.913
could haul logs up this hill.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.683
It's gonna weigh
1,000 pounds or more.

08:05.419 --> 08:08.220
I'm gonna build, kind of,
a zipline using a cable and

08:08.255 --> 08:10.789
some ropes and some
pulleys to haul logs from,

08:10.824 --> 08:13.658
that I cut down there
and get them up my land.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.063
Some of these are good.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.700
My first thing is I'm
setting up an anchor up here.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.070
Anchor is just basically
tying it off to a couple trees.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.674
That's good.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.944
Pretty much everything I do
out here I have to kind of

08:32.980 --> 08:34.746
learn how to do on my own.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.781
(metal clang)

08:38.218 --> 08:39.551
it's not rocket science,

08:39.586 --> 08:41.853
but you know it is
my first time doing it.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.889
I can't kind of just set
things up willy-nilly.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.291
I gotta make sure all my
anchors are really solid.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.693
As this all gets weighted
down with significant weight,

08:48.729 --> 08:50.962
it could become dangerous.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.465
Okay. So, I got my
two anchors set up.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.700
I got my cable rolled out.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.135
It's getting kind of dark,
so I think it's enough

08:57.170 --> 08:58.503
work for one day.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.039
So, I'm gonna grab my
gear and head home, rest up,

09:01.074 --> 09:04.342
and get to work on
step two tomorrow.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.185
Johnny: Out here,
I'm in charge of myself.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.555
I'm essentially my own boss.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.956
If something
needs to get done,

09:17.991 --> 09:19.658
it's up to me to do it.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.494
The only person that's
held accountable is myself.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.902
Johnny: Hey, where are you
going with my hammer, huh?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.071
Come here. Thank you.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.607
I appreciate your help out here.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.542
This is my first
winter in the arctic.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.978
And I'm gonna be
experiencing temperatures that

09:40.013 --> 09:41.413
I've never seen before.

09:41.448 --> 09:45.216
Windchill, it's known to
get 60 even 70 below zero.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.952
<i> Narrator: Johnny rolfe</i>

Johnny: First order of
business is to start making

10:06.773 --> 10:08.306
the windows.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.774
The window's important for me.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.776
I'm north of the
arctic circle.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.546
That means I get true
24-hour periods of complete

10:14.581 --> 10:16.348
darkness for weeks.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.517
So any little light I can
get from nautical twilight,

10:19.553 --> 10:22.253
reflection off the snow
is gonna help in my cabin.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.556
This is polycarbonate.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.192
It's a shatter-resistant
material.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.731
Putting a window in
a cabin is basic,

10:32.766 --> 10:34.099
but it doesn't mean it's easy.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.334
I really only have one
shot to make this work.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.806
It's not a good feeling
cutting a hole in the side of

10:41.842 --> 10:44.109
your newly built cabin.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.144
It's a terrible feeling.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.113
But I gotta do it.

11:00.293 --> 11:04.029
♪ ♪

11:04.965 --> 11:07.432
(pounding)

11:10.370 --> 11:13.171
awesome. That's a start.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.876
See if I cut too much.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.248
Great.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.216
So, it looks like I
played it pretty safe,

11:25.252 --> 11:30.021
and I could take another
shave off of this end,

11:30.524 --> 11:32.891
with the chainsaw.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.835
Oh, god!

11:53.113 --> 11:55.246
That's why you
gotta wear eye protection.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.815
I hit the very end of a spike.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.516
There's a, there's a spike
that comes through from this

11:58.552 --> 12:00.885
log down into this one.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.021
A quarter inch of
it is hanging down.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.156
A chain caught it, and
it threw my saw back.

12:05.192 --> 12:09.060
Yeah, that, that chain could
have easily hit that spike,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.396
and that's how people
get cuts in the face.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.632
If I was to get thrown down on
the ground and have a saw cut

12:14.668 --> 12:16.868
my face open,
there is, that's that.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.470
That's me lying on the ground.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.604
Nobody knows I'm out here.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.839
Nobody knows where I'm at.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.407
Nobody knows I'm hurt.

12:22.442 --> 12:26.177
And time and time again
where I'm shown how
real life is out here.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.513
Every day, there's
some sort of reminder.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.217
It's a... Whew, man.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.759
Let's see how this
sheet fits in here.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.830
Oh, that's a
really awesome fit.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.332
That's great.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.000
Just gotta take your time.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.437
That's kind of what this
lifestyle's all about for me.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.643
It's a good feeling,
to be able to do this
with my own hands.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.979
I feel self-reliant.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.947
And that's my goal out here.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.649
Oh, you want a hug real quick?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.117
Oh, well, I'll give you a hug.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.153
Come here.
Give me a hug, huh.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.088
You happy this window is done?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.123
You scare all the
bears out of the yard now?

13:12.159 --> 13:13.892
Is that what
you're happy about?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.960
You're a good dog,
aren't you, huh?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.897
To have a warm, comfortable
cabin is paramount for me and

13:18.932 --> 13:20.832
my success out here.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.200
So, first thing
tomorrow morning,

13:22.235 --> 13:23.701
I'm gonna get
that floor put in,

13:23.737 --> 13:26.638
so I can get that
stove in there.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.485
Kaleb: Piss poor planning
makes piss poor results.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.621
So we're gonna negate that
and have great planning
with great results.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.901
Brittany: We got you guys some
really cool things that are

13:56.937 --> 13:58.603
going to be very helpful.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.804
You get to carry them.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.006
You have to walk
slow and careful.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.309
Your very own hatchets!

14:04.344 --> 14:06.211
Elovie: Aww!
Brittany: Look at that!

14:06.246 --> 14:08.279
Elovie: Thank you!
Brittany: You're welcome.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.749
Kaleb: You guys have
to walk with the sharp
point facing down.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.019
<i> Narrator: The rowlands must</i>
<i> prepare their wood lot before</i>

14:15.055 --> 14:18.356
<i> freezing temperatures</i>
<i> and dark winter hit.</i>

14:18.391 --> 14:21.292
<i> To ensure the logs</i>
<i> are retrievable once</i>
<i> the river freezes,</i>

14:21.328 --> 14:24.562
<i> they will limb and hoist</i>
<i> fallen trees to prevent</i>

14:24.598 --> 14:27.432
<i> them from getting</i>
<i> frozen into the ground.</i>

14:28.468 --> 14:31.903
Kaleb: So, I think your
job is gonna be to just
start limbing everything.

14:31.938 --> 14:35.273
I, personally, like limbing
off the top of the chain

14:35.308 --> 14:38.042
because then it doesn't
blow sawdust chips in my face.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.210
Brittany: Okay.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.880
Kaleb: The chain is moving
this way which makes the saw

14:41.915 --> 14:44.182
want to kick back
toward you, so you have
to be real careful.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.517
Brittany: One thing, when
it comes to learning from my

14:46.553 --> 14:50.355
husband is he shows you
once and then he walks away.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.324
And you either better have
gotten it or you're going to

14:53.360 --> 14:55.727
flounder and figure it out.

14:58.798 --> 15:02.300
Kaleb: I grew up going
to the firewood lot
every year as a kid.

15:02.335 --> 15:06.471
And, right now, it's fall, and
I'm working on getting ready

15:06.506 --> 15:08.339
for the winter season.

15:08.375 --> 15:12.110
One of my biggest jobs
in the wintertime is
gathering firewood.

15:14.848 --> 15:18.082
My job now is to prep that
firewood to make it easier to

15:18.118 --> 15:20.385
get it out of the woods.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.987
Work smarter, not harder.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.831
Brittany: Wow, gilbert,
you're so strong.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.433
Don't whack
yourself in the eye.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.668
Kaleb: I'm feeling
good about this.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.169
All this stuff that I'm just
able to just pick up and

15:38.204 --> 15:41.105
carry away is just frozen
in in the wintertime.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.708
So this gets me a good start.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.410
Brittany: Okay,
let's prop the trees.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.544
Kaleb: Yup.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.212
Brittany: And then,
we'll go have lunch?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.248
Kaleb: Sounds good.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.718
Alex: If I'm getting
frustrated because things

15:53.753 --> 15:55.520
aren't going my way.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.222
I always gotta remember

15:58.258 --> 16:01.359
"okay. Take my time, you know,
it's gonna pay off in the end."

16:02.929 --> 16:06.397
just try to enjoy the process
of learning more and not get

16:06.433 --> 16:09.033
frustrated with it.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.809
I'm too young to die.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.678
So, I left off yesterday
with the cable setup.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.380
I got my two
anchors kind of set up.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.415
Cable's still loose.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.584
So now I need to
elevate the cable.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.924
So, I got this nice and high.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.026
Uh, once I pull out
the slack in the cable,

16:35.061 --> 16:36.728
I think I'll be good.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.530
Uh, the only question is, uh,
is this tree strong enough to

16:39.566 --> 16:42.500
handle a heavy load?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.902
Sometimes these birch trees
can be a little rotten on the

16:44.938 --> 16:47.905
inside, even though
they're still standing.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.677
Now I think I can go
down and start to put
tension on the cable.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.680
Hopefully,
that's tight enough.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.684
I think I need
another rope down here.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.819
Pull it really
tight and tie it off.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.855
Yeah, we'll try that.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.890
If the cable isn't as
tense as I can make it,

17:05.925 --> 17:09.527
the log could be dragging
on the ground, waving.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.397
Having it slack would make
the job really difficult,

17:12.432 --> 17:14.332
and a little more dangerous.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.635
It's not making it any easier.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.605
I didn't think tightening up
this cable would be such a big

17:20.640 --> 17:24.108
pain in the butt but, uh, it's
kind of taking some doing.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.910
I suck at mechanical stuff.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.578
It's not really
my strong point.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.814
When things go my way,
I'm a pretty happy camper.

17:29.849 --> 17:33.184
When things don't go my way,
I get frustrated pretty quick.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.919
I (bleep) suck
at this (bleep).

17:34.954 --> 17:36.521
I got kind of used to
working alone out here,

17:36.556 --> 17:37.955
so usually if things
aren't going my way,

17:37.991 --> 17:39.690
I just cuss and
just let it all out.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.026
Maybe I need a
second (bleep) pulley.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.861
Dang. (bleep).

17:43.897 --> 17:45.263
Why would you
design it this way?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.231
If I can't get the cable
pulled all the way tight,

17:47.267 --> 17:49.067
I won't be able
to make it work.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.735
What's all this (bleep)?

17:59.379 --> 18:02.280
Alex: Let's just try
it, see if it'll work.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.616
I'm trying to do this kind
of like the same way rock

18:05.652 --> 18:08.986
climbers climb up a rope
with a ladder of anchors.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.555
One goes up, holds.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.658
The other one comes
up higher, holds.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.259
I wasn't really feeling
like I could do this,

18:15.295 --> 18:18.830
but if you just stick
with it, you'll find a way.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.267
I got the cable tight.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.037
So, what I'm gonna do now is
basically like a test run.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.372
I don't completely trust
my work 'cause this is

18:28.408 --> 18:29.740
my first time doing it.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.276
I want to test it out with a
small amount of weight first

18:32.312 --> 18:35.947
before I fully load it.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.853
So let's, uh, send it down.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.525
That little bit of slackness
kind of makes it go slow.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.634
I pulled the little
guy right on up.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.503
Uh, no issues.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.838
It took a little muscle,
but not very much at all.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.974
My full-sized logs
will be heavier,

19:03.009 --> 19:05.843
I'm really hoping this
is gonna work because
I need cabin trees.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.812
I'll be back here first thing
tomorrow to start cutting down

19:07.847 --> 19:09.847
the big boys.

19:15.221 --> 19:18.122
Johnny: Out here, in nature,
everything is soft edges,

19:18.158 --> 19:20.691
it's rolling curves.

19:20.727 --> 19:24.795
There's no straight,
perfect, parallel lines,

19:24.831 --> 19:27.298
uh, in nature.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.544
It takes one log to make
two boards for the floor.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.347
And to make two boards, I
need to make five passes.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.651
Around 48 boards total.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.387
That's a lot of cutting.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.893
How does that look, sideburns?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.562
It look good?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.664
At this point, I'm
sleeping on the ground.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.265
It's cold.
It's damp.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.466
It's a great way to get sick.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.068
So, if I don't
get the floor in,

20:04.103 --> 20:06.571
it's kind of a
recipe for disaster.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.440
In order to make a
floor for my cabin,

20:09.475 --> 20:11.375
I need to make
dimensional lumber.

20:12.245 --> 20:16.747
Dimensional lumber is
wood that's been cut
to a specific size.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.884
A lot of work, but I'd
rather be doing this than

20:19.919 --> 20:22.420
a lot of other things.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.223
It's not always
about what's easy.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.793
I just get a lot of
satisfaction of out
of being self-reliant.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.429
These are the last two boards.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.698
You know, they're
not perfect but, uh,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.399
I like character.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.101
(sneezing).

20:37.136 --> 20:40.571
I think there's enough sawdust
on my dog and I to completely

20:40.607 --> 20:43.341
insulate my cabin alone.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.476
Some people look at
it as a nuisance,

20:45.511 --> 20:48.846
but I look at it
as a resource.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.053
I'm gonna use this
resource to insulate
the floor of my cabin.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.957
I'm gonna put it down on
the floor before I put the

20:59.993 --> 21:02.827
floorboards in.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.266
This is gonna be a
damn toasty floor.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.935
I am excited about this.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.338
It's a lot of work.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.707
I'm hauling trees
across the uneven tundra.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.175
I'm getting dirty.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.678
I'm getting
covered in sawdust.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.616
Honestly, there's no
other place I'd rather be.

21:30.223 --> 21:33.291
The next thing to do
is to grab some nails,

21:33.326 --> 21:35.593
pound them in.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.395
A little bit of
a workout, man.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.196
Slamming this thing around.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.998
Ooh-wee.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.937
What do you think,
java, does it look good?

21:46.973 --> 21:49.807
It adds a lot of
character in the floor.

21:49.842 --> 21:53.044
You got bumps and
curves, and I like it.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.912
That's my style.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.281
Kinda imperfectly perfect.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.750
So that's step two of three.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.420
Next thing I gotta do is
get the stove installed.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.789
Um, and that's gonna
start warming up my cabin,

22:04.824 --> 22:06.891
I can cook in here,
I can heat my water,

22:06.926 --> 22:08.326
and I can dry my clothes.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.594
So I'm really excited
to get that started.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.697
I'm out of breath.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.077
Chris: I have to
prepare for everything.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.845
Out here, you fall
behind and you're cold.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.280
You fall behind,
you're hungry.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.149
You fall behind
and life gets hard.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.763
<i> Narrator: Chris morse is</i>
<i> on the hunt for new land to</i>

22:45.798 --> 22:50.000
<i> secure much needed</i>
<i> firewood for him and jessi</i>
<i> to survive the winter.</i>

22:50.737 --> 22:52.770
<i> But in order to</i>
<i> get to the new area,</i>

22:52.805 --> 22:55.206
<i> he will need to clear</i>
<i> enough trail for a loaded</i>

22:55.241 --> 22:57.708
<i> three-wheeler to</i>
<i> drag logs through.</i>

22:59.145 --> 23:00.845
Chris: Must've had a windstorm
come through here and knock

23:00.880 --> 23:03.214
down a bunch of trees.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.950
All sorts of crap to
cut out of the way.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.287
It's too bad I can't use this.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.423
This is all green.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.226
I have to spend the time
to find a new wood yard.

23:15.261 --> 23:18.062
When you think about an entire
eight-foot pickup truck.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.330
That's a quart of wood.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.798
We're burning up
to two of those,

23:20.833 --> 23:23.167
in a week, when
it's really cold.

23:23.202 --> 23:26.771
That's just a ton of firewood.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.943
All right.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.412
That's out of the way.

23:34.447 --> 23:38.015
Keep moving forward.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.317
So really, the name of
the game is to get out,

23:40.353 --> 23:41.986
find some wood,
'cause in two weeks,

23:42.021 --> 23:44.054
everything's gonna be frozen
and I don't wanna be wasting

23:44.090 --> 23:47.892
time looking for wood when
I need to be burning wood.

23:52.398 --> 23:56.634
Oh. (bleep)

24:10.316 --> 24:14.185
this is some swamp.
I did not expect this.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.687
Last time I came down here,
this is all dry.

24:16.722 --> 24:19.723
But, man, we got a lot of rain
this year and everything's

24:19.759 --> 24:22.493
flooding in, cosna's flooded,
makes sense that all these

24:22.528 --> 24:23.961
swamp lands are flooded.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.697
Guess I'm gonna have
to cut a trail around.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.432
I gotta keep moving forward.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.935
So, it is what it is.

24:33.506 --> 24:37.541
I've got my trail
breaker to cut my way through.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.078
Ain't too bad.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.614
Little extra work.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.484
I feel like the
cosna's always throwing
sticks in my progress.

24:46.519 --> 24:50.421
And today, I feel like
I ran into a big old
swamp of despair.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.723
Oh, it's swampy everywhere.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.859
And it's really disheartening.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.360
Every time I try
to do something,

24:56.395 --> 24:57.895
the cosna sets me back.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.663
But sometimes I feel
like it's just testing me,

24:59.699 --> 25:01.398
and if I keep up with my
perseverance and I keep

25:01.434 --> 25:04.802
pushing forward, there
will be rewards at the end.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.240
All right, I've cut a
trail around this swamp now.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.542
I need to push through
before the light disappears.

25:11.577 --> 25:14.144
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very difficult to get home.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.358
Jess, you there?

25:27.393 --> 25:28.959
<i> Jessi (over radio):</i>
<i> Hey, I'm right here.</i>

25:28.995 --> 25:31.161
Chris: I'm down at the
woodyard looking around.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.530
There ain't anything left.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.900
I mean, maybe four trees in
total in this entire woodyard.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.635
<i>Jessi (over radio): Oh, my love.</i>

25:37.670 --> 25:40.337
<i> That sucks.</i>

25:40.373 --> 25:42.306
Chris: Yeah, I think I'm
gonna call it a night.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.440
The sun's setting.

25:43.476 --> 25:44.808
I'm pretty far out here.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.343
I'm gonna start
working towards home.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.313
Tomorrow, hopefully,
I can get to the new
woodyard and find some trees.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.993
Brittany: Life takes effort.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.530
In order to really
live a full life,

26:06.566 --> 26:09.733
you have to be willing
to put in the effort.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.243
Elovie: Dad?
Kaleb: What?

26:19.278 --> 26:23.280
Elovie: What you up to?
Kaleb: Stuff and nonsense.

26:23.316 --> 26:26.250
Our goal is just get
these tops off the,

26:26.285 --> 26:28.719
off the ground so
they're not frozen in.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.387
Brittany: What is this
tool, the black one, called?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.122
Kaleb: Called a handyman jack.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.158
Brittany: Handyman?

26:34.193 --> 26:37.061
Kaleb: All right, now get that
stump situated under there so

26:37.096 --> 26:41.198
it's nice and not precarious.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.566
Yeah, that's perfect.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.603
The goal of this trip is to
lift the big heavy logs up out

26:45.638 --> 26:46.804
of the moss.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.506
I start by limbing the trees
down and now we'll pick the

26:49.542 --> 26:52.076
log up and set
it on that stump.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.144
That way in the winter time,
I'll be able to just yank it

26:54.180 --> 26:56.747
right out of there because
nothing will be frozen in.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.016
Brittany: How's that?
Kaleb: Perfect. Yeah!

26:59.051 --> 27:01.485
Now just get this one
under and I'll drop it down.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.721
Well, hopefully,
I don't drop it.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.523
Brittany: Like that?
Kaleb: Yup.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.693
All right, look at that, it
got it up out of the moss.

27:09.729 --> 27:10.694
That was perfect.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.762
Brittany: Nice.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.397
When I got
dressed this morning,

27:13.432 --> 27:16.000
I put on a plaid
shirt and overalls.

27:16.035 --> 27:19.236
And I had this
moment of, "who am I?"

27:19.271 --> 27:24.141
I'm not a lumberjack for sure,
but I'm posing as one today.

27:25.578 --> 27:28.312
Timber!

27:28.347 --> 27:31.115
The brittany of seven
years ago would be like,

27:31.150 --> 27:34.818
"why would I be the one going
out and getting the wood?"

27:38.024 --> 27:39.957
kaleb: That cleans
this out pretty nice.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.560
I think we're going to prop
this up and probably call it.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.763
Brittany: Sweet!

27:47.199 --> 27:48.565
Kaleb: This is a big tree.

27:48.601 --> 27:50.200
Brittany: Yeah.
There you go.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.802
Kaleb: That won't roll
off when it gets weight?

27:51.837 --> 27:54.104
Brittany: I don't think so?
Kaleb: Okay.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.040
Brittany: It's
pretty set there.

27:56.075 --> 27:59.043
Kaleb: Man, we have
made a huge difference
in the forest today.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.344
Brittany: Yay!

28:00.379 --> 28:01.812
I am so glad I
was able to help.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.313
Kaleb:
Everything's propped up.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.448
Brittany: So we're done?

28:04.483 --> 28:06.784
Kaleb: Yup.
You did a great job today.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.085
This would have
taken me, like,

28:08.120 --> 28:09.953
four or five days
in the wintertime.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.088
Brittany: Cool.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.423
Kaleb: Let's get boogying.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.959
Brittany: Okay.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.132
Alex: In the army,
I got used to, you know,

28:22.168 --> 28:23.634
everything you do,
you do as fast as you can.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.135
Go, go, go.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.371
But out here, that's just,
that's the wrong mindset.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.206
If you try to do stuff
in a hurry like that,

28:29.241 --> 28:31.909
it's just, it's
just bad business.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.983
This is probably my
favorite thing I do out here,

28:40.019 --> 28:41.652
cutting down trees.

28:41.687 --> 28:42.820
Uh, just a couple
tools for this job,

28:42.855 --> 28:45.322
just a saw and an axe.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.527
Yesterday I verified that the
zipline does work in theory.

28:50.563 --> 28:54.364
So, it's time to cut down
the big trees and haul 'em up.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.999
I like using my axe.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.068
I like the simplicity of it.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.504
I like the rhythm of it.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.806
I like the smell
of the spruce.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.174
I would've been
happy as a, you know,

29:04.210 --> 29:06.777
an old school lumberjack.

29:08.814 --> 29:11.482
Timber!

29:13.018 --> 29:16.053
Well, another
tree bites the dust.

29:18.691 --> 29:20.591
Sipsey is all eyes and ears.

29:20.626 --> 29:23.427
I'm sure the wind is
making him nervous.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.829
There's a lot of strong wind.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.998
It's gonna make this
kind of dangerous.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.434
Now, I gotta haul
these logs up the zipline.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.370
This will be a lot heavier
than the test run I did.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.072
Just kinda going with
a simple setup here,

29:35.107 --> 29:37.574
wrapping the tow
strap around it.

29:38.144 --> 29:41.044
So, this wind, I don't know
if it's gonna cause a problem.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.047
Can't predict
what's gonna happen.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.520
First log of the day.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.469
Heavy son of a bitch.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.806
Some of my anchors are
squeaking and popping and the

30:08.841 --> 30:11.041
birch tree is bowing.

30:11.076 --> 30:13.410
This might be a problem here.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.293
Okay break for a second.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.461
Whew.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.331
Ahhh!

30:36.969 --> 30:40.204
I hate this log.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.477
Whew!

30:47.513 --> 30:48.946
Well, that's the first log up.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.247
Everything held good.

30:50.282 --> 30:54.651
Definitely feel, you know,
kinda glad I got that done.

31:00.793 --> 31:02.659
(laughing).

31:02.695 --> 31:05.395
Yeah, well, so much
for the soft landing.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.298
I was a paratrooper, I
know how to fall on my ass.

31:10.836 --> 31:13.270
Now I can just go into work
mode and just enjoy the work,

31:13.305 --> 31:14.838
grind it out.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.306
You know, I took
a little time,

31:16.342 --> 31:17.441
built this new apparatus.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.409
I pay thousands of
pounds worth of wood.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.845
And I still am able to stick
with my values of using

31:21.881 --> 31:23.714
muscle power only.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.550
So, that makes me feel good.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.587
Johnny: If you come out
here without self-reliance,

31:30.623 --> 31:33.557
you're gonna quickly find it
or you're gonna find yourself

31:33.592 --> 31:36.526
in trouble.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.635
All right, java,
just stay back, dude.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.971
All right, here we go.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.044
Winter is definitely coming.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.546
Very, very fast transition.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.916
I can see snow creeping
down the mountains already.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.985
It's time that I stop cooking
outside and get this stove

32:02.021 --> 32:04.988
installed in the cabin.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.694
Well, it's gonna cool
it down pretty fast.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.663
Be just a little bit longer,
maybe a little more water and

32:12.698 --> 32:15.599
it'll be ready to move.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.011
Nice.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.780
The stovepipe's gonna
come up right through
the ceiling here.

32:29.815 --> 32:30.914
Gotta cut a hole.

32:30.950 --> 32:31.982
Boom.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.850
This is my great-grandfather's
hand drill.

32:33.886 --> 32:36.720
I wonder what this has
built, what this has seen.

32:36.755 --> 32:41.224
Feels good augering a
hole with his tools.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.995
I'm the fourth
generation to use this tool.

32:45.030 --> 32:47.464
Yup, I'm through.

32:48.701 --> 32:53.337
It's like a relationship
with him even though
I've never met him.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.606
Yup, I see light
through the top.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.076
So, that's my pilot hole.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.211
I have about a week before
snow is on the ground and I'm

33:01.246 --> 33:03.747
cutting a hole in my roof.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.116
You know, if it goes wrong,
can't go to a hardware store,

33:06.151 --> 33:08.385
I can't pick up spare parts.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.321
It's kind of a one-shot deal.

33:24.069 --> 33:26.203
Yeah, that looks good to me.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.138
I gotta open it up some more.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.941
Taking it a little bit
at a time so I don't
take too much off.

33:34.513 --> 33:38.949
Gotta put the stovepipe
and that rain cap on.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.087
It's kinda like the star on
top of the christmas tree.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.659
It's been a long
process to get all this done.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.195
Uh, I'm really looking forward
to getting inside that cabin

33:52.231 --> 33:54.998
and, uh, giving
this stove a test run.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.069
I'm gonna sleep warm tonight.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.346
Chris: Alaska has
taught me to be a survivor.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.048
Persevere.
Aim forward.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.349
Push through the pain.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.818
Push through
adversity and make it.

34:29.968 --> 34:33.103
This is looking pretty good.

34:33.138 --> 34:36.106
Got a lot of white spruce up
on the ridgeline there and the

34:36.141 --> 34:39.242
dead spruce burn really well.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.412
Yesterday I got out to the
old woodyard and it's pretty

34:42.448 --> 34:43.447
picked over.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.848
There's not much left.

34:44.883 --> 34:47.084
So today I'm in, uh, a new
area and I really just want a

34:47.119 --> 34:50.120
lot of tall, standing,
dead spruce.

34:50.155 --> 34:52.255
Oh, there's a good dead tree.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.925
Oh, yeah!

34:54.960 --> 34:57.494
That's what I'm talking about!

34:59.031 --> 35:01.398
Hey, jessi!

35:01.433 --> 35:03.700
<i>Jessi (over radio): Hey, love!</i>

35:04.136 --> 35:06.536
Chris: I found the
motherlode of trees.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.438
I'm gonna fell a couple,
try to load my sled up,

35:08.474 --> 35:11.141
and I should be back
to you before too long.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.310
<i> Jessi (over radio):</i>
<i> Be safe, love.</i>

35:13.345 --> 35:15.278
<i>I know that you're really far</i>

35:15.314 --> 35:18.048
<i> really safe when</i>
<i> you fell those trees.</i>

35:18.083 --> 35:20.817
Chris: Sounds good.
I'll talk to you
in a little bit.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.323
This is the closest
dead tree to the trail.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.424
It's really dry.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.359
It's all crunchy and it's
gonna burn really good.

35:29.394 --> 35:31.328
But if this tree doesn't
fall in the right direction,

35:31.396 --> 35:34.030
it's gonna get hung up and it
just makes it more dangerous.

35:34.066 --> 35:36.600
I'm hoping to get it to fall
towards the three-wheeler.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.904
Well, damn!

35:40.939 --> 35:43.340
That did not fall the
way I wanted it to,

35:43.375 --> 35:46.543
but it fell into two other
dead trees and knocked 'em over,

35:46.578 --> 35:49.646
so, I got three dead
trees with one cut.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.249
I'm gonna chalk
this one up to a win.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.683
I gotta get this
thing chopped up,

35:53.719 --> 35:56.119
get it in the sled,
and get home.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.021
I got a long
trail ahead of me.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.561
Whoo!

36:04.596 --> 36:06.530
It has taken a lot of work
to get to this wood yard,

36:06.565 --> 36:07.864
but I am pumped.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.299
We're not gonna
be cold this year.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.790

that trailbreaker.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.759

cabin on the nodwell trail

37:09.795 --> 37:11.595

37:11.630 --> 37:13.730

check in with jess.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.833

37:16.868 --> 37:18.702

my pants cut off,

37:18.737 --> 37:20.704
