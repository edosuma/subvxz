01:12.767 --> 01:14.243
Let's enter, young ladies.

01:14.286 --> 01:15.945
Our show is the act of refinement.

01:15.987 --> 01:18.417
It will astound you and amaze you.

01:18.460 --> 01:22.630
It is also educational, and it costs you only 10 cents.

01:22.673 --> 01:26.033
- Come on, let's go inside.
- But we told the dean w were going to the art institute.

01:26.075 --> 01:29.550
- If they find out we'll get in trouble.
- He said it was educational, didn't he?

01:29.593 --> 01:30.685
- Let's go.
- Come on!

01:30.728 --> 01:33.821
Right this way, young ladies.
Four tickets for the young ladies.

01:34.408 --> 01:36.221
And now ladies and gentlemen...

01:36.378 --> 01:39.334
If you follow me to the outer range of the museum...

01:39.432 --> 01:43.698
As we approach the cage, proceed with extreme cautious.

01:44.258 --> 01:49.828
Because, as I introduced to you Pluto, the wild man

01:49.871 --> 01:52.611
who was captured in the wild of Africa,

01:52.654 --> 01:55.704
he's just as wild and ferocious today

01:55.747 --> 01:58.060
as the day he was captured.

02:01.656 --> 02:06.563
Not too close, ladies, because it was women
that made the wild man wild.

02:09.176 --> 02:11.295
If you please, Mr. Schultz.

02:30.930 --> 02:33.332
Stop it! Stop it!

02:33.985 --> 02:37.012
- If you treat him like a beast then he becomes one.
- What do you mean?

02:37.139 --> 02:38.978
Just stop hitting him, that's all.

02:39.811 --> 02:44.067
- Look out! Are you crazy?
- You made him that way! Don't beat him anymore!

02:44.110 --> 02:45.134
Herbie!

02:45.177 --> 02:51.037
Now, if you young ladies and the rest of you folks
will just follow up to the next platform

02:51.150 --> 02:53.870
I want to introduce you to the
world'd greatest phenomenon:

02:53.912 --> 02:56.083
The Pretzel twins.

02:56.126 --> 03:00.966
They will bend, twist and curve in a...

03:28.383 --> 03:32.333
Now look here, young lady, if you don't leave
that man alone you have to leave the place.

03:32.376 --> 03:35.089
- Why? I didn't do anything to him.
- He's dangerous.

03:35.356 --> 03:38.078
Last time he grabbed a girl she disappeared, puff!

03:38.526 --> 03:40.266
Now leave! Leave him alone!

03:40.919 --> 03:42.488
What's the matter with you?

03:54.885 --> 03:56.677
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Joan.

03:59.596 --> 04:02.182
Thank you, Mary and Sadie.

04:02.225 --> 04:06.902
And now, ladies and gentlemen, if we all
just move over to the next platform,

04:06.945 --> 04:09.375
I want to introduce to you a man

04:09.418 --> 04:12.991
who has all the wizardry of modern magic at his fingertips.

04:13.291 --> 04:17.637
Not a man of 1,000 tricks, but a man of 10,000 tricks.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.452
He will not only amaze and astound you,

04:20.726 --> 04:24.626
but will confound you with his modern piece of magic.

04:24.853 --> 04:28.986
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Great Houdini.

04:35.673 --> 04:37.187
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.

04:40.351 --> 04:43.784
For my first trick, a small miracle.

04:45.891 --> 04:50.124
As you see, I have just an ordinary piece of paper.

04:51.108 --> 04:54.828
I take the paper and form a simple cone.

04:55.502 --> 04:56.649
I bend the end.

04:56.968 --> 05:00.849
If you place your attention to the
pitcher of milk on the table,

05:01.580 --> 05:04.613
I take the milk and pour it into the magic cone.

05:11.831 --> 05:15.645
To the doubting comers who don't believe this is milk
I pour it into the glass.

05:16.491 --> 05:17.505
See?

05:19.864 --> 05:22.117
For the young ladies who like sweet milk

05:22.160 --> 05:24.452
I add a little sugar.

05:28.283 --> 05:31.298
I pick the wand, stir it just a little bit...

05:33.458 --> 05:34.471
Watch.

05:34.771 --> 05:38.144
One, two, three!

05:45.361 --> 05:46.627
Evaporated milk.

05:46.954 --> 05:49.261
That magic's gotta go.

05:49.441 --> 05:51.016
It slows up the turnover.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.179
You can see that, can't you?

05:52.221 --> 05:56.103
Yeah, but he won't play the wild man
unless I let him do those tired tricks.

05:56.146 --> 05:57.838
Are you the boss, or aren't you, huh?

05:57.881 --> 06:01.171
Don't you see how all the girls go for the wild man?

06:01.214 --> 06:05.091
That boy has got something, and he won't forget a magic.

06:05.507 --> 06:09.187
Now, for my next trick I shall need the assistence
of some volunteer from the audience.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.307
Young lady, would you kindly step upon the platform?

06:12.479 --> 06:14.685
Oh, I can't do anything like that.
I don't want to.

06:14.728 --> 06:17.392
- Go, go.
- I don't wanna go in front of the audience!

06:17.852 --> 06:19.929
- Come right up here. Don't be afraid.
- I...

06:19.972 --> 06:22.347
Thank you. Let's give the young lady a nice hand.

06:23.264 --> 06:25.371
- And this is for assisting me.
- Oh, thank you!

06:25.414 --> 06:26.718
What is your name, young lady?

06:26.870 --> 06:31.190
- I don't have the habit to give my name to strangers.
- She has not the habit to give her name to strangers.

06:31.233 --> 06:32.566
Uh, have we met before?

06:32.609 --> 06:35.012
- Certainly not!
- Much to my misfortune.

06:35.712 --> 06:39.972
Now, will you kindly write your name down on
this piece of paper. Don't let me see it! Please!

06:40.015 --> 06:41.093
- Fine.
- Thank you.

06:45.681 --> 06:47.171
- Have you written it?
- Yes.

06:47.214 --> 06:50.060
Now, put it in the flame and drop it in the urn.

06:50.234 --> 06:52.740
Now concentrate on your name while it's burning.

06:53.194 --> 06:54.694
- Are you concentrating?
- Yes.

06:54.737 --> 06:56.200
- Is it burning?
- Yes.

06:56.243 --> 06:57.257
Thank you very much.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.906
Now, may I have your hand, please?

06:59.467 --> 07:01.473
Oh, please, it's gonna help the vibrations.

07:02.319 --> 07:03.324
Thank you.

07:03.606 --> 07:05.766
Now, will you close your eyes and concentrate?

07:16.767 --> 07:19.504
- Um, you're not concentrating.
- Oh.

07:19.547 --> 07:21.786
I want you to hold my hand real tight, and concentrate,

07:21.828 --> 07:23.761
because I'm going to read your thoughts.

07:24.474 --> 07:28.068
- Oh, my goodness.
- Please, you must concentrate.

07:28.774 --> 07:30.314
- All right.
- Thank you.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.327
Oh, now I'm getting an image.

07:35.778 --> 07:37.058
And it's a good one.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.898
Oh! I take some ashes...

07:40.941 --> 07:42.251
watch me carefully...

07:42.294 --> 07:43.511
I rub it on my arm.

07:44.051 --> 07:45.064
Watch!

07:46.663 --> 07:48.940
There! Is that your name? Bess?

07:48.983 --> 07:50.896
- Yes!
- Thanks.

07:50.939 --> 07:53.524
Do you see? The vibrations do help.

07:53.566 --> 07:55.656
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- And I thank you.

07:55.699 --> 07:58.802
Now, folks, if you step in this direction
to the next exhibit.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.038
Oh, I... Don't go. This is for you.

08:01.763 --> 08:03.584
Oh. Thank you.

08:04.822 --> 08:05.869
Don't go.

08:06.669 --> 08:08.091
Let go of my arm.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.415
But if I let you go, I'll never see you again.

08:11.162 --> 08:13.458
I have no intention of seeing you again.

08:14.445 --> 08:15.469
Here!

08:22.975 --> 08:25.481
And now, folks, you could step over in this direction

08:25.561 --> 08:30.215
I will introduce you to the little people
The Mystic Isle of Little People.

08:30.521 --> 08:36.167
Believe me when I announce:
their names are Mr. and Mrs. Bigger.

08:36.270 --> 08:39.063
Probably because he is bigger than she is.

08:42.914 --> 08:48.335
He doesn't say anything because like
all normal husbands he's not allowed to.

08:50.025 --> 08:52.998
Now, in normal life, just like you and me,

08:53.771 --> 08:56.825
she lives in a big home, he lives in a small house.

08:56.868 --> 08:57.934
Don't be afraid!

08:57.977 --> 09:00.128
- I'm not afraid.
- Then come here.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.160
You should better get back in your tent
before they whip you.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.090
You wouldn't let them whip me, would you?

09:07.133 --> 09:09.426
- I wish I could help you.
- Well, you can.

09:09.469 --> 09:12.341
- How?
- By having dinner with me tonight.

09:12.749 --> 09:15.159
- Oh, that's the most ridiculous...
- Oh, Bess...

09:15.202 --> 09:18.802
- I just wanted to meet you.
- Well, you failed!

09:18.845 --> 09:19.991
No, no, Bess...

09:20.034 --> 09:21.842
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Excuse me. Bess...

09:22.785 --> 09:24.393
- The wild man!
- No, ma'am...

09:35.750 --> 09:37.903
- Please, let me explain.
- Get away from me!

09:38.430 --> 09:41.578
- Bess, I've gotta talk to you!
- I don't wanna meet the two of you.

09:41.621 --> 09:47.404
Oh, you could've tears in your eyes for the wild man,
but for the great Houdini nothing?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.229
- You're crazy!
- Bess!

09:49.272 --> 09:51.492
Get your junk out of here! You are fired!

09:51.535 --> 09:53.172
- All right!
- Now, wait a minute!

09:53.215 --> 09:55.291
We can't let him go! I told you....

09:55.334 --> 09:56.788
Let him go! He is fired!

10:18.433 --> 10:20.833
What made you wanna come to Coney Island tonight?

10:21.206 --> 10:24.116
Oh, I don't know, I just wanted to go.

10:24.159 --> 10:28.177
Now that we are here, we could skip these things
and going somewhere to ride.

10:28.220 --> 10:31.413
All right. Let's go over there.

10:36.718 --> 10:40.253
- Let's go in here instead.
- But you said you wanted a ride.

10:40.296 --> 10:43.601
Oh, we will. Yeah, but later.
Let's go in here first. Please!

10:43.967 --> 10:45.226
Huh, Houdini the Great.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.990
Watch it! Watch it closely, Ladies and Gentlemen.

10:49.033 --> 10:54.153
Will Houdini survive or will he become
beheaded on this block?

10:54.353 --> 10:56.563
Watch it, watch it, Ladies and Gentlemen.

10:56.659 --> 11:01.672
This is without a doubt the most dangerous feat
ever performed before the public.

11:03.757 --> 11:06.244
- Are the ropes securely tied, gentlemen?
- Oh, yes, sir.

11:06.286 --> 11:09.185
Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, before I start the conveyor...

11:09.580 --> 11:14.946
Ladies and Gentlemen, before I move the switch
let's be quiet and make a silent prayer.

11:15.877 --> 11:17.422
Thank you very much.

11:18.237 --> 11:21.090
And now, Houdini, are you ready to defy death?

11:21.177 --> 11:22.180
I'm ready.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.782
Ladies and Gentlemen, watch it closely.
I will demonstrate before your very eyes

11:25.825 --> 11:27.826
the murderous power of this saw.

11:28.302 --> 11:31.395
There he goes, Ladies and Gentlemen, on his way to doom.

11:31.438 --> 11:33.888
There's only six feet between him and a horrible death.

11:33.931 --> 11:36.440
This is the most death-defying feat of all time.

11:36.482 --> 11:40.787
Ladies and Gentlemen, 5 feet, 5, feet.
He's in trouble now!

11:40.830 --> 11:43.067
Hurry up, hurry up, Houdini, you haven't much time!

11:43.110 --> 11:45.800
4 feet, Ladies and Gentlemen, just 4, now 3!

11:45.843 --> 11:48.336
3 feet, a scary yard, Ladies and Gentlemen!

11:48.379 --> 11:50.526
I can't stand to look at it any longer!

11:50.569 --> 11:53.979
Oh, no, Ladies and Gentlemen, I can't bear to watch it.

11:54.406 --> 11:56.779
I only hope nothing goes wrong.

11:56.822 --> 11:59.243
You are braver than I, Ladies and Gentlemen.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.772
Stop it! Stop it! Stop that thing!

12:07.985 --> 12:09.011
He made it!

12:09.054 --> 12:13.682
Wasn't that tremendous, Ladies and Gentlemen?
Wasn't that tremendous?

12:13.725 --> 12:15.965
But he might not make it the next time.

12:16.008 --> 12:18.400
Come and bring your friends, Ladies and Gentlemen.

12:18.443 --> 12:21.239
The next show starts in one half hour.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.956
Thank you, thank you very much.

12:31.619 --> 12:33.229
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

12:40.690 --> 12:41.790
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:42.370 --> 12:46.197
we have this evening a new attraction
for your special edification.

12:46.690 --> 12:49.750
For centuries man has been searching
for the fountain of youth.

12:50.224 --> 12:52.964
Professor Allegari has come all the way from Italy

12:53.297 --> 12:55.889
to demonstrate his sensational discovery.

12:56.517 --> 12:59.157
Ladies and gentlemen, for your special edification

12:59.782 --> 13:02.063
- I give you Professor Allegari!
- Someone you know? - No!

13:02.106 --> 13:04.288
- Then stop looking at him.
- I can't help it.

13:07.693 --> 13:08.940
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:09.246 --> 13:11.193
if there's an elderly gentleman in the house

13:11.236 --> 13:13.023
who would like to become young again,

13:13.066 --> 13:16.035
please, step right up here, and I wiill rejuvenate him.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.142
Please?

13:18.610 --> 13:20.876
Here's someone that longed in this world.

13:21.003 --> 13:22.956
- Would you be so kind?
- What?

13:22.999 --> 13:27.185
- Would you like to be rejuvenated?
- You didn't have to ask, son. Thank you.

13:28.392 --> 13:31.992
I don't know what the axeman will say about this
but I'm sure I'll give it a try.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.512
- Oh, um, pardon me, young Lady.
- It's all right.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.128
Excuse me.

13:41.424 --> 13:42.551
This way, please.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.745
Drink.

14:39.930 --> 14:42.237
That's the same fellow we saw
at Coney Island last week.

14:42.936 --> 14:43.963
I know.

14:44.653 --> 14:47.240
Oh, that's why you insisted to come here, isn't it?

14:47.719 --> 14:51.552
- I had no idea he would be here.
- Then why did you pick this of all places to come?

14:52.472 --> 14:54.065
I don't know, Fred.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.522
Do you mind if we go?

14:59.908 --> 15:02.902
- But we just got here!
- I don't know what's the matter. Let's go.

15:13.266 --> 15:14.927
What happened to the party that was here?

15:15.054 --> 15:17.009
I don't know. They just left.

15:17.052 --> 15:18.788
They didn't even order anything.

15:36.175 --> 15:38.128
I looked for you at the museum

15:38.808 --> 15:40.392
and looked for you at Coney Island.

15:40.994 --> 15:42.328
but you keep running away.

15:44.254 --> 15:45.881
This time I came back.

15:46.769 --> 15:47.797
Why?

15:50.919 --> 15:51.965
I don't know.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.813
I do.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.506
For the same reason I took this job.

15:57.420 --> 15:58.800
I knew you would come here.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.579
But...

16:01.166 --> 16:02.438
how could you know?

16:03.646 --> 16:05.826
Well, everything happens to me in threes.

16:06.072 --> 16:07.775
This is the third time we've met.

16:08.752 --> 16:09.769
I know.

16:10.972 --> 16:12.351
I shouldn't even be here.

16:14.257 --> 16:15.402
We're strangers.

16:26.837 --> 16:28.242
We were never strangers.

16:32.145 --> 16:34.009
I thought you said you forgot your gloves.

16:34.518 --> 16:36.332
I didn't wear gloves tonight, Fred.

16:36.945 --> 16:38.318
Come on, Bess, they're waiting.

16:39.428 --> 16:40.571
I'm not going.

16:43.472 --> 16:46.735
- Look, I brought you here and I'm taking you home again.
- I'm not going.

16:46.778 --> 16:49.338
- What is the trouble?
- No trouble at all. We're leaving.

16:49.381 --> 16:50.388
You are leaving.

16:50.431 --> 16:53.391
- Come on. Let's not have any trouble.
- I'm sorry, miss. - It's all right.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.531
But she came with me and she's leaving with me.

17:00.392 --> 17:01.787
Would you like to dance?

17:01.830 --> 17:03.107
I would love to.

17:14.371 --> 17:16.151
I've only got one more show to do.

17:16.194 --> 17:18.155
Then where would you like to go?

17:18.768 --> 17:19.984
Wherever you go.

18:21.679 --> 18:23.159
<i>Is that you, Harry?</i>

18:25.412 --> 18:28.199
Yes, Mama. Good night.

18:29.745 --> 18:32.346
Son, would you like to have a glas of milk?

18:37.912 --> 18:40.302
Uh... Mom, this is Bess.

18:40.692 --> 18:43.066
- Bess.
- Bess, this is Mom.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.113
I'm so glad to know you.

18:46.128 --> 18:47.646
Isn't she wonderful, mother?

18:48.007 --> 18:49.801
Yes, she is very pretty.

18:50.653 --> 18:51.707
Thank you.

18:53.928 --> 18:56.888
Oh, it's... it's a wonderful night tonight. Isn't it?

18:57.194 --> 18:59.247
I never saw a more wonderful night.

19:00.482 --> 19:04.274
Well, now that everything is so wonderful,

19:04.802 --> 19:07.195
what are your two wonderful people up to?

19:08.958 --> 19:11.715
Oh, I was gonna show her some of my magic.

19:17.059 --> 19:18.966
At 2 o'clock in the morning?

19:19.346 --> 19:20.372
It is?

19:20.712 --> 19:22.666
Oh, we didn't mean to disturb you.

19:22.709 --> 19:25.528
No, we promise not to make any noise,
so you go back to bed, Mom.

19:25.571 --> 19:30.611
- Isn't it a little late for the young lady to be out?
- Oh, no, it's all right. Isn't it, Harry?

19:30.911 --> 19:33.764
Y-Yes. You see, she has no school tomorrow.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.600
- No school?
- No. She stays at a girls' school.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.391
And... And I'm locked out.

19:39.434 --> 19:40.944
- Locked out?
- Uh-huh.

19:40.987 --> 19:43.920
Oh, child, that's nothing to worry about.

19:43.963 --> 19:45.467
You can spend the night with me.

19:45.510 --> 19:50.016
- Oh, no, I wouldn't want to put you through any trouble.
- No trouble at all. We have lots of room.

19:50.059 --> 19:52.019
- But...
- No, Mother, I'll fix the place for her.

19:52.061 --> 19:54.274
- She could take my room.
- She'll do no such thing.

19:54.317 --> 19:56.477
No, Harry. I think it's time we talk about...

19:56.520 --> 20:00.880
On second thought I think it would be better if she did
go back to school. They're probably worried about her.

20:00.922 --> 20:03.512
- I... I can't go back now.
- Yes, you can. Good night, Mama.

20:07.868 --> 20:11.361
- Why didn't you tell her?
- Oh, Bess, honey, I couldn't.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.056
We got married so quick and all...

20:13.098 --> 20:15.504
But I'll tell her first thing in the morning.
Honest, I will.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.657
It would be much better if you told her tonight.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.820
It'll be better in the morning. We're leaving anyway.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.522
Harry, I don't like this.

20:27.565 --> 20:29.428
I wish we'd tell her now.

20:29.471 --> 20:31.844
She would just keep us up all night talking about it.

20:56.633 --> 20:57.662
We made it.

21:00.734 --> 21:02.320
- I love you.
- I love you.

21:12.837 --> 21:14.557
Here's a nightgown for you, darling.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.938
I think it will fit.

21:16.030 --> 21:17.050
Uhuh.

21:19.136 --> 21:21.356
Did you think you could fool your mother, Harry?

21:22.049 --> 21:24.389
I just wanted to see how far you would go.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.290
I like her, Harry.

21:31.340 --> 21:32.410
Good night.

21:34.089 --> 21:35.135
Coward.

21:47.652 --> 21:50.545
Harry, what are you doing?

21:51.665 --> 21:54.535
I'm working on a brandnew trick. Come here.

21:56.836 --> 21:57.878
No!

21:58.116 --> 21:59.120
What?

21:59.163 --> 22:00.709
You said you wanted to be in the act.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.830
- Yes, but not now.
- Oh, come on, I need you.

22:02.873 --> 22:04.584
- What do I have to do?
- Get in the box.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.760
- What does that do?
- You'll see later.

22:06.803 --> 22:10.099
- Oh, Harry, I'm not going to lay in there.
- Now get into the box.

22:10.142 --> 22:12.102
- If you say so.
- Now put your feet through here.

22:12.145 --> 22:13.558
- This is ridiculous.
- Put your feet here.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.400
- You wake me up in the middle of the night.
- Now put your head through there. - Through there?

22:17.442 --> 22:19.146
I don't like this at all. I'm scared.

22:19.188 --> 22:22.641
- Watch your fingers.
- What would people say if they could see me here now?

22:22.814 --> 22:26.191
- We won't tell a soul. You're comfortable?
- As comfortable as I could be.

22:26.234 --> 22:28.021
- Good.
- Harry, I'm scared though.

22:28.064 --> 22:29.854
What are you doing down there, huh?

22:29.897 --> 22:33.550
- Fixing this in.
- Oh, don't do that. That's not fair. Don't.

22:33.703 --> 22:37.323
Don't, Harry. I'm nervous.
Where are you? What are you doing?

22:37.409 --> 22:40.102
- I went to get the saw.
- The saw? What are you gonna do with that?

22:40.151 --> 22:43.918
- I'm gonna saw you in half.
- Oh, no, Harry, no, you're not! I won't let you!

22:43.961 --> 22:46.088
- Harry, let me out of here! Harry!
- Sssh!

22:46.131 --> 22:48.764
- Do you wanna wake mother?
- Harry, get me out of here!

22:48.807 --> 22:52.047
- It's not gonna hurt. Close your eyes.
- How do you know that? You're not inside!

22:52.089 --> 22:56.569
Oh, Harry! Harry, I'm scared! Harry, let me out of here!

22:56.769 --> 22:57.835
Harry!

22:57.915 --> 22:59.850
Harry, I'm sacred! Harry!

22:59.893 --> 23:02.732
- Don't worry!
- Aw! Harry! Harry!

23:05.232 --> 23:06.803
It's a great effect, isn't it?

23:08.732 --> 23:12.113
Yes, it's... it's great but will we

23:12.155 --> 23:15.719
- have to do something like this every night?
- Was it so awful?

23:15.826 --> 23:19.657
No, but I expected something different
on my wedding night.

23:20.893 --> 23:23.412
<i>♪ Bumm, bumm ♪</i>

23:23.613 --> 23:27.089
<i>♪ Bumm, bumm, bumm ♪</i>

23:27.132 --> 23:31.578
♪ The bell in the bay ♪

23:31.621 --> 23:34.361
♪ On the day ♪

23:34.404 --> 23:41.384
♪ That my love sailed away ♪

23:42.157 --> 23:47.461
♪ And the gold wheeling high ♪

23:47.504 --> 23:53.616
♪ As farewell from the sky ♪

23:54.840 --> 23:58.540
♪ But the bell ♪

23:58.793 --> 24:03.733
♪ In the bay ♪

24:04.500 --> 24:09.153
♪ Said goodbye ♪

24:20.215 --> 24:21.368
I'll shoot them!

24:22.222 --> 24:24.082
Calm down! Put your gun down!

24:24.125 --> 24:26.015
That's the way they show their appreciation.

24:26.057 --> 24:27.932
Appreciation? Baaa! Oh, you...

24:29.396 --> 24:31.756
- Come on, honey, you're next.
- Me? I have to go out there?

24:31.799 --> 24:34.092
- They love magicians in West-Virginia.
- Are you sure?

24:34.135 --> 24:36.475
Oh, yeah, go on. You go around there.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.103
Music, maestro, please.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.264
Thank you. Thank you very much.

25:39.111 --> 25:41.711
Now, if you keep your eye to my charming assistant...

25:41.784 --> 25:45.364
then I shall let go the goldfish, dissolved in thin air.

25:46.231 --> 25:48.337
One, two...

25:56.392 --> 25:58.303
Oh, the poor goldfish.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.877
At least give us a chance.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.137
Go learning!

26:37.388 --> 26:38.673
For my next trick...

26:40.254 --> 26:43.073
I will create an effect never permormed on any stage.

26:44.263 --> 26:46.330
I will disappear from this spot

26:46.757 --> 26:48.243
right before you eyes.

26:48.473 --> 26:50.260
Well, hurry up and disappear!

26:59.933 --> 27:01.580
I'll help him disappear.

27:15.594 --> 27:17.945
Don't worry, folks, I'm right here.

27:30.774 --> 27:36.460
They like you, son. They like you.
Go get your wife to hear the applause.

27:38.349 --> 27:42.864
Bess, listen to that. Listen to that applause.
I've got them eating right out of my hand.

27:45.292 --> 27:46.652
What's the matter, baby?

27:47.052 --> 27:48.265
What's the matter?

27:48.518 --> 27:54.117
They ruined our performance. I almost my leg on a
crushed tomato, and you ask me what's the matter?

27:54.307 --> 27:57.249
We are not in the showbusiness,
we're targets in a shooting contest.

27:57.292 --> 27:59.746
We won't always have to play before an audience like that.

27:59.789 --> 28:03.400
- It has been like this in the last two years.
- But it finally gets better.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.106
Here's what's left from the goldfish.
We haven't found the rest yet.

28:07.149 --> 28:10.506
You have to hurry up because the
night train to Wheeling is on time.

28:10.808 --> 28:14.971
Thanks. Wheeling. We probably get shot there.

28:15.537 --> 28:17.564
Harry, let's go back to New York.

28:18.070 --> 28:20.163
We can't get bookings in New York.

28:20.317 --> 28:22.523
We could take that job in the safe factory.

28:24.210 --> 28:25.224
Yeah!

28:25.321 --> 28:29.161
With your knowledge of locks and combinations
I'm sure that they pay you well.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.211
Yeah.

28:30.371 --> 28:31.841
Will you try it, Harry?

28:33.471 --> 28:34.483
No!

28:35.088 --> 28:36.181
Why not?

28:36.318 --> 28:38.196
I am a magician, not a locksmith.

28:39.253 --> 28:41.046
You can't pull bread out of your hat.

28:41.162 --> 28:43.380
Well, if you want bread you should've married a baker.

28:43.770 --> 28:46.059
At least a baker makes something that people want.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.097
Nobody seems to want your magic, Harry.

28:51.658 --> 28:53.577
There's nothing new in card tricks.

28:54.225 --> 28:57.605
Going through trapped doors or escape from cabinets.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.971
- What does it all mean?
- I don't know what it means.

29:00.679 --> 29:02.521
I only know what it does to me.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.356
Like tonight when I did that disappearing act.

29:05.424 --> 29:07.843
Tough as they were, you should have seen their faces.

29:08.264 --> 29:11.597
I gave them a thrill, something
they take home and talk about.

29:12.607 --> 29:16.521
So you thrill them for a minute,
but tomorrow it will be forgotten.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.007
Next time I'll give them a bigger thrill,
something they won't forget so soon.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.873
The audience is never satisfied.

29:22.176 --> 29:24.343
They love you for the moment that you please them.

29:24.524 --> 29:28.819
Darling, I love you forever. I'd like to make
a home for us, something that last...

29:29.284 --> 29:32.264
- if you just let me.
- Magic is all I know.

29:32.307 --> 29:35.426
- Oh, you could be anything you wanted to be.
- How?

29:35.773 --> 29:37.179
I never went to school.

29:37.353 --> 29:40.860
I started working when I was 9 years old
with a magician in a tent show.

29:41.099 --> 29:45.099
If I quit now and take that job in that factory,
I'll be there for the rest of my life.

29:47.607 --> 29:48.927
Oh, Bess,

29:49.727 --> 29:52.475
I didn't marry you to give you that kind of a life.

29:53.300 --> 29:56.366
Oh, honey, darling, don't you understand?

29:56.582 --> 30:00.942
I'm so tired riding milk-trains
and living out of suitcases.

30:00.985 --> 30:06.576
I'd be satisfied if we just once could spend
two nights in the same place.

30:07.391 --> 30:11.497
Hey, didn't you pack that staff yet?
Come on, let's go! That train only stops for the milk.

30:11.540 --> 30:12.667
We'll be right there.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.924
Well, we got to hurry.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.493
Unhook me, please.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.271
Quick, Harry.

30:23.831 --> 30:25.224
Harry? Oh.

30:26.142 --> 30:27.595
We're gonna miss the train!

30:51.717 --> 30:52.744
Oh, Mr. Brown.

30:52.891 --> 30:55.172
When do you think I'll get a chance to work on the safes?

30:55.215 --> 30:58.135
- What's the matter? Don't you like your job?
- Oh, I like it well enough,

30:58.178 --> 31:00.481
but you could train chimpanze for the work I'm doing.

31:00.524 --> 31:03.398
Not a bad idea, son. Drop it in the suggestion box.

31:21.222 --> 31:24.162
I guess you were working on the big safes
a long time, haven't you?

31:24.708 --> 31:27.715
- About 40 years.
- Is that sol? - Yeah.

31:28.294 --> 31:31.108
I was wondering, if someone accidentally
got locked up in one of them,

31:31.151 --> 31:34.070
could they get out by working the tumblers
from the inside?

31:34.173 --> 31:37.506
- Not in my safe.
- They couldn't, huh? - No.

31:38.752 --> 31:40.312
Let me try it sometime?

31:41.538 --> 31:43.394
Certainly not. Are you crazy?

31:43.464 --> 31:46.937
- No, I was just asking.
- Well, go back and do your work and leave me alone.

31:47.037 --> 31:49.429
- Sorry, I was just wondering.
- Go on.

31:49.939 --> 31:53.273
What kind of people they get
to work around here nowadays?

31:56.007 --> 31:57.067
Hi, Ma.

31:59.660 --> 32:00.707
Hello, honey.

32:00.804 --> 32:03.130
- How you're doing?
- How are you? - Fine.

32:03.359 --> 32:05.717
- How was work today?
- Just great.

32:05.862 --> 32:08.948
I opened 8,642 locks.

32:09.115 --> 32:10.415
Oh, cheer up, Harry.

32:10.928 --> 32:14.754
- They'll let you work on the big safes soon.
- Oh, sure, in about 40 years.

32:15.014 --> 32:19.120
Well, at least we're not dodging tomatoes
and you get paid every Saturday night.

32:22.624 --> 32:23.651
Thank you.

32:33.776 --> 32:35.695
- Harry?
- Hm?

32:36.236 --> 32:38.402
You're two and a half dollars short.

32:38.445 --> 32:40.376
- Am I?
- Uhuh.

32:40.896 --> 32:44.242
Uh, you didn't stop anyplace, did you?

32:45.002 --> 32:46.602
As a matter of fact, I did.

32:47.082 --> 32:48.702
I had a chance to pick up a bargain.

32:48.745 --> 32:51.117
Oh, really? Where is it and what is it?

32:55.985 --> 32:58.029
- Uh, they're good ones.
- Oh, I'm sure.

32:58.072 --> 32:59.849
Here, I'll prove it to you. Put them on.

33:01.585 --> 33:02.954
Now make sure they're locked good.

33:02.997 --> 33:06.877
- They're locked. - You're sure? - Uhuh.
- Wouldn't think that I could get out of them, would you?

33:06.920 --> 33:08.305
Now cover them with the towel.

33:09.632 --> 33:10.666
That's right.

33:10.709 --> 33:15.652
That makes 8,643 locks that I have opened today.

33:16.969 --> 33:18.289
That's very nice, Harry.

33:18.332 --> 33:19.929
I better finish washing.

33:19.972 --> 33:21.455
Dinner is just about to be ready.

33:23.905 --> 33:25.098
Just a minute.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.771
We're not eating here.

33:27.061 --> 33:28.681
I'm taking you out for dinner.

33:28.904 --> 33:32.042
- Taking me out? Oh, where are we going?
- Well, that's a surprise but...

33:32.085 --> 33:36.099
- Oh, what do I wear? Oh, Mama, how is the dress?
- It's all finished, except the belt.

33:36.142 --> 33:38.155
Oh! Finished? Oh, thank you!

33:41.395 --> 33:45.447
- The Astor? Can we afford it?
- Nothing but the best for you, my love.

34:13.896 --> 34:14.922
Thank you.

34:15.802 --> 34:18.909
There is, uh, quite a few magicians
here tonight, isn't there?

34:19.176 --> 34:20.996
Magic's getting to be quite a hobby.

34:21.069 --> 34:24.208
- <i>It's actually a model of a very old...</i>
- Oh, what's going on up there?

34:24.395 --> 34:29.358
But today we discovered that if we use a machine
like this correctly, we can place an object in the hole.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.007
We can pass the blade through the object

34:32.667 --> 34:35.368
with absolutely no damage to either the cabbage

34:35.714 --> 34:37.674
or the celery down below.

34:38.007 --> 34:40.806
Watch the miracle of magic ready: One...

34:41.313 --> 34:43.454
two, three...

34:47.446 --> 34:49.710
Something seems to have gone wrong.

34:51.250 --> 34:54.516
I tell you, I don't have another cabbage
and I did want to do this tonight.

34:54.560 --> 34:58.400
Ah, but I did bring a young lady with me. I wonder
if you would might helping. Would you, please?

34:58.443 --> 34:59.883
- You're not afraid, are you?
- No.

34:59.926 --> 35:00.949
Fine.

35:01.189 --> 35:03.769
Just kneel down, please, and put your head there.

35:04.509 --> 35:09.496
And just make sure you don't go anyplace
for a few minutes. I'll lock you in. Right so.

35:13.874 --> 35:15.481
Is your head-on good and tight?

35:15.697 --> 35:16.708
Yeah.

35:19.708 --> 35:21.868
Alright, ready again then.

35:22.030 --> 35:24.016
At the count of three...

35:24.429 --> 35:26.463
watch the blade.

35:26.937 --> 35:31.624
Ready. One, two, three!

35:35.549 --> 35:37.157
You see, Ladies and Gentlemen,

35:37.396 --> 35:40.903
the object of this trick is to make it
to look as vicious as possible...

35:41.116 --> 35:43.689
but not doing any damage to the young lady.

35:44.173 --> 35:45.802
Now, that didn't hurt, did it?

35:47.913 --> 35:49.446
Where's the young lady?

35:56.012 --> 35:59.052
That was very good. Thank you.
And thank you, little lady.

35:59.442 --> 36:00.998
She keeps her head very well.

36:02.165 --> 36:03.465
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:03.851 --> 36:06.638
for the finale of this evening's entertainment and, uh...

36:07.218 --> 36:08.685
before we have our dinner,

36:08.858 --> 36:12.704
we offer a challenge in escape routines
that has never been tried before.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.751
<i>I will ask for volunteers.</i>

36:15.317 --> 36:17.130
<i>Bring on the restraints.</i>

36:17.685 --> 36:18.703
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Harry.

36:18.804 --> 36:19.810
<i>Right up.</i>

36:19.898 --> 36:21.943
- But they're just asking.
- <i>Come along.</i>

36:22.904 --> 36:25.845
Now let me see how many have we here.
One, two, three, four...

36:25.888 --> 36:30.081
Oh, come, gentlemen, this is for the grand prize.
We need one more volunteer.

36:31.114 --> 36:33.421
Now, fellas, these are regulated straitjackets

36:33.464 --> 36:36.380
wich had bo loaned to us
fot this occasion by a hospital.

36:36.454 --> 36:39.732
Uh, no inmate has ever escaped from one of these.

36:40.114 --> 36:43.414
Are you sure there isn't one more
brave soul in this gathering?

36:44.134 --> 36:45.154
Please.

36:47.767 --> 36:50.827
Oh, go ahead, and embarrass yourself. Go on.

36:51.562 --> 36:53.062
- Here.
- Ah.

36:57.848 --> 37:01.667
Would you take your coat off? Put it right over there.
Would a couple of you gentlemen help us?

37:01.721 --> 37:04.129
We have your little evening jacket right here.

37:04.874 --> 37:05.915
That's right.

37:06.888 --> 37:09.401
Let's strap it good and tight. Here. Ready?

37:09.444 --> 37:12.948
Now, right on first, then the left, that's it.
That's really good.

37:13.180 --> 37:14.753
Strap him up good and tight there.

37:14.796 --> 37:16.929
- I'll be back here.
- All right. Fine.

37:16.972 --> 37:18.667
Come along, let's line up there.

37:18.710 --> 37:19.797
Hurry up, boys.

37:20.517 --> 37:22.057
That's it. Line up there.

37:22.643 --> 37:24.057
In the line. All clear.

37:24.237 --> 37:25.263
Ah.

37:25.356 --> 37:29.016
As you can see, Ladies and Gentlemen, one
has to be a little crazy to put on one of these.

37:29.925 --> 37:32.458
Now, Gentlemen, the stage is yours.

37:32.587 --> 37:34.624
And good luck. Music, please.

39:30.611 --> 39:31.691
Tremendous.

39:36.992 --> 39:39.400
Magnificent, my boy. Magnificent.

39:39.443 --> 39:42.240
And I guess there's no doubt
who wins the prize.

39:42.863 --> 39:45.823
There you are, my boy, and good luck to you.

39:48.564 --> 39:50.150
You know, Mr. Houdini,

39:51.755 --> 39:54.644
no one has ever escaped from a straitjacket before.

39:55.113 --> 39:58.240
I've been a magician for over 40 years. I've...

39:58.467 --> 40:01.717
been in quite a few places,
did a quite of few things in my time, but...

40:03.096 --> 40:06.089
there was always some explanation, some trick.

40:07.563 --> 40:08.889
Tonight there was none.

40:09.182 --> 40:10.329
There couldn't have been.

40:11.249 --> 40:12.556
Yet, you got out.

40:13.725 --> 40:16.718
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Malue,
but it was a trick.

40:16.761 --> 40:19.838
- Have you done it before?
- No, but it's still a trick.

40:20.403 --> 40:23.844
We must all guard our secrets.
I can't ask you how you did it.

40:25.242 --> 40:28.010
But if you take a little advice from an old man:

40:28.442 --> 40:30.258
Drop it. Give it up.

40:31.995 --> 40:33.848
But why if I made such an impression?

40:34.126 --> 40:36.735
Because it isn't a trick.

40:41.412 --> 40:44.612
You've seen something like this before, haven't you?

40:45.515 --> 40:47.199
Where? Who did it?

40:47.762 --> 40:52.189
Well, it was many years ago in Berlin.

40:53.220 --> 40:54.835
A man named Von Schweger.

40:55.526 --> 40:57.971
There was nothing unusual about his act until the finish.

40:58.271 --> 41:00.480
Then he was sealed inside a giant bottle.

41:00.523 --> 41:02.004
Now, the bottle was not faked,

41:02.829 --> 41:03.883
yet, he got out.

41:04.178 --> 41:06.149
How could he get out of a sealed bottle?

41:06.424 --> 41:08.971
The talk was that Von Schweger was able to dematerialize.

41:09.014 --> 41:10.854
Of course, it was only talk.

41:11.207 --> 41:13.094
Von Schweger... Von Schweger...

41:13.954 --> 41:15.997
I've read all the books on the great magicians,

41:16.040 --> 41:17.814
but I've never seen his name mentioned.

41:17.857 --> 41:20.950
Just when he could've made a name for himself,
he quit the profession.

41:21.563 --> 41:22.580
Why?

41:22.623 --> 41:24.172
No one knows for sure.

41:24.402 --> 41:27.762
But I think he was frightened by what he was able to do.

41:28.876 --> 41:30.169
I'd like to meet him.

41:30.588 --> 41:31.877
Is he still alive?

41:32.072 --> 41:33.421
Last I heard he was,

41:33.941 --> 41:35.661
but he never sees anyone.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.674
Oh, we seem to be about the last to leave.

41:38.866 --> 41:41.906
- Good night, Mrs. Houdini. I twas nice to meet you.
- Good night. Thank you.

41:41.949 --> 41:42.959
Good night, sir.

41:43.227 --> 41:44.868
Drop it. Drop it.

41:46.264 --> 41:47.809
It will make you famous,

41:48.681 --> 41:50.220
but it will kill you.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.826
You're not happy, are you, Harry?

42:05.093 --> 42:06.466
Why shouldn't I be?

42:06.999 --> 42:09.772
Because I stopped you from doing
what you really want to do.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.135
I won't lie to you, Bess.

42:12.394 --> 42:14.641
I'd rather do magic than test locks.

42:16.164 --> 42:18.531
But I'm happy. Believe me, I am.

42:19.471 --> 42:21.677
The audience does something to you, Harry.

42:21.961 --> 42:25.951
Like tonight, when you got out of the straitjacket
and everyone applauded,

42:26.664 --> 42:29.019
you... you were like a different person.

42:33.612 --> 42:35.245
Which "Me" do you like the most?

42:36.788 --> 42:38.805
I like the both very much.

42:47.436 --> 42:50.162
Hey! We forgot about the prize that you won.

42:50.205 --> 42:52.055
- It's in my coat pocket.
- I'll get it.

42:54.919 --> 42:55.953
Here it is.

42:57.296 --> 42:58.360
What is it?

42:59.205 --> 43:01.745
- It's a boat ticket.
- A boat ticket? - Uh-huh.

43:02.485 --> 43:03.612
To Europe.

43:04.132 --> 43:05.154
Europe?

43:06.482 --> 43:08.668
Oh, Bess, that's where I've always wanted to go.

43:08.936 --> 43:11.008
That's where I really could learn something.

43:12.993 --> 43:15.172
Why, I might even meet Von Schweger.

43:16.366 --> 43:18.846
Well, it's a round-trip passage for one.

43:21.283 --> 43:23.603
We can trade it in for two one-ways, can't we?

43:25.344 --> 43:28.543
Or we could cash it in for a down-payment on a house.

43:30.150 --> 43:33.256
If we don't take this opportunity,
we'll never get it again.

43:33.380 --> 43:35.836
It's more important to you than anything, isn't it?

43:36.854 --> 43:38.088
Tonight's Halloween.

43:38.171 --> 43:40.948
Something strange always happens to me on Halloween night.

43:40.991 --> 43:42.431
We can't pass it up.

43:43.741 --> 43:45.924
It's your ticket, Harry, you won it.

43:46.111 --> 43:48.111
I won't stop you if you wanna go.

43:48.482 --> 43:50.138
Well, I won't go alone.

43:50.607 --> 43:52.150
And I won't go with you.

43:54.659 --> 43:56.789
You're just afraid because of what he said tonight.

43:56.832 --> 43:58.642
I'm more than just afraid.

43:58.685 --> 44:01.605
He's an old man. They're always afraid of new things.

44:01.698 --> 44:03.045
We shouldn't be.

44:03.274 --> 44:06.360
Maybe I shouldn't be, but I am.

44:15.990 --> 44:17.751
Well, I can't live without you.

44:18.777 --> 44:20.044
Cash it in.

44:21.970 --> 44:23.110
Oh, Harry.

44:23.443 --> 44:24.675
Harry, darling.

44:26.389 --> 44:28.316
Time's up!

44:42.888 --> 44:44.598
Here's your quarter. Get ready.

44:44.918 --> 44:46.361
Are you sure you can get out?

44:46.790 --> 44:48.681
I'll be out before they know I'm in.

44:54.551 --> 44:55.595
Quick.

45:00.329 --> 45:02.660
What are you doing over there?

45:04.829 --> 45:06.622
- Now you've done it.
- It'a all right.

45:06.665 --> 45:09.519
- He told me to do it. He said he could get out.
- But he can't get out.

45:09.562 --> 45:11.718
Mr. Bown. Mr. Brown. Where is Mr. Brown?

45:11.760 --> 45:14.277
Mr. Brown, there's a man locked up in the safe.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.440
- Well, can't you open this?
- No, the timelock is on.

45:16.482 --> 45:18.934
It's up for 24 hours. It won't open till tomorrow.

45:18.977 --> 45:22.017
- Who is in there?
- Houdini. - Oh, I might've known this.

45:22.104 --> 45:23.522
But we can't let him die in there.

45:23.565 --> 45:25.517
- That'd give the company a bad name.
- Yeah.

45:25.569 --> 45:29.248
- We've got to think of something.
- There's one thing, but it'll ruin the safe.

45:29.290 --> 45:31.777
Well, ruin it. A man's life is at stake.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.751
- Get clear! It's a short fuse.
- Get back!

45:51.124 --> 45:52.520
What you'd blow it up for?

45:52.806 --> 45:54.953
If you'd given me a little more time, I'd gotten out.

45:54.996 --> 45:56.413
You're fired!

46:02.515 --> 46:05.655
I still don't understand what you
where doing inside that safe.

46:07.833 --> 46:10.668
I told you a hundred times I was having my lunch.

46:13.119 --> 46:14.692
You did it deliberately.

46:15.585 --> 46:17.212
You wanted to get fired.

46:18.626 --> 46:20.845
Why would I do a crazy thing like that?

46:23.743 --> 46:26.103
So you could go back to be a magician.

46:28.468 --> 46:30.385
What's wrong with magicians?

46:32.098 --> 46:34.184
That's what I was when you married me.

46:38.556 --> 46:41.788
Well, if you love your magic more than
you love me, good luck to both of you,

46:41.831 --> 46:43.275
because I'm leaving!

46:47.854 --> 46:50.101
Go talk to her, Harry. Don't let her leave.

46:50.288 --> 46:52.592
Look at this soup. It's like water!

46:53.762 --> 46:55.548
Where did she ever learn to cook anyway?

46:55.591 --> 46:56.954
I made the soup!

47:03.220 --> 47:06.113
You can stop packing! I'm the one that's leaving!

47:07.797 --> 47:11.310
- Harry, where are you going?
- Where they don't water the soup!

47:18.417 --> 47:20.223
<i>...being a time in captivity.</i>

47:20.266 --> 47:22.646
<i>Oscar, the human sea serpent.</i>

47:22.689 --> 47:25.352
- <i>Half man, half...</i>
- It's over there. - Thank you.

47:25.455 --> 47:27.449
- Hey, just a minute, lady.
- That is all right.

47:27.702 --> 47:30.149
All right, all right, come in here!

48:14.328 --> 48:17.068
Ladies and gentlemen, my latest invention:

48:17.163 --> 48:18.349
The metamorphosis.

48:19.732 --> 48:20.905
Music, please.

48:26.873 --> 48:30.199
Now, please, examine the trunk and see
that there's no means of escape.

48:32.704 --> 48:33.718
Satisfied?

48:33.761 --> 48:37.857
Now, will you pick it up and turn it around and
show the audience that it's just an ordinary trunk.

48:42.445 --> 48:43.618
Thank you.

48:43.923 --> 48:45.931
Would you fasten these to my wrist, please?

48:46.960 --> 48:48.018
A bag.

48:49.504 --> 48:50.671
Are they secure?

49:00.634 --> 49:01.752
Now, tie it.

49:07.818 --> 49:08.818
Thank you.

49:09.653 --> 49:12.197
I'm sorry, you won't be able to go this trip. No.

49:15.210 --> 49:16.225
Lock.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.790
Now, tie it with the rope.

49:26.237 --> 49:27.563
Good sailor knots.

49:33.602 --> 49:34.642
Tight?

49:37.467 --> 49:39.328
Ah! You hold the key.

49:39.371 --> 49:40.429
Women.

49:44.719 --> 49:47.506
Ladies and gentlemen, the metamorphosis.

49:50.232 --> 49:51.272
One,

49:51.758 --> 49:52.765
two,

49:53.280 --> 49:54.292
tree,

49:54.498 --> 49:55.512
four...

49:55.555 --> 49:58.961
five, six, seven...

49:59.340 --> 50:00.340
All right.

50:02.378 --> 50:05.478
Gentlemen, would you please untie the ropes
that you yourself tied?

50:08.032 --> 50:12.244
Now, if you unlock the trunk, make sure there's
no change and nothing had been touched.

50:16.313 --> 50:17.355
And the bag.

50:18.223 --> 50:19.461
Untie it, please.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.430
You fake!

50:35.943 --> 50:36.956
Fake!

50:36.999 --> 50:38.873
Did I hear someone yell "Fake"?

50:39.232 --> 50:41.285
I'm Dooley of the London Examiner!

50:41.328 --> 50:43.568
I say all you yank magicians are fakes!

50:43.610 --> 50:45.374
And that's a trick-trunk!

50:45.705 --> 50:47.911
I'd like you'd get out of something real.

50:48.404 --> 50:50.205
I resent your remarks.

50:50.591 --> 50:52.784
I'll offer £ 100 to anyone

50:52.853 --> 50:55.560
who can lock me up in anything I can not escape from!

50:55.787 --> 50:57.387
Just a minute! Just a minute!

50:57.560 --> 50:59.457
Mr. Houdini! Mr. Houdini!

50:59.500 --> 51:00.973
Let the gentleman speak!

51:01.770 --> 51:05.720
Mr. Houdini, I challenge you to escape
from one of our London jails.

51:06.062 --> 51:09.232
I'd like nothing better than to accept
your challenge, Mr. Dooley,

51:09.301 --> 51:11.500
but I'm afraid the authorities will not permit it.

51:11.691 --> 51:14.787
I see Inspector Marlick from Scotland Yard
is in the audience.

51:14.940 --> 51:16.444
What do you say now, yank?

51:16.959 --> 51:18.604
My offer still stands.

51:18.989 --> 51:21.357
Let's teach the yank a lesson, Inspector.

51:21.423 --> 51:22.917
All that fake is bluff!

51:22.960 --> 51:28.506
- Lock him up! - Sure he can't fool Scotland Yard.
- Oh, no, no, it's hardly done.

51:28.766 --> 51:30.179
Please! Please!

51:30.559 --> 51:34.229
I'll admit that Scotland Yard has the
finest police panes in the world,

51:34.999 --> 51:37.639
but these old sardine cans you call jails

51:37.726 --> 51:40.179
are no challenge for the great Houdini.

51:40.370 --> 51:43.516
Did you hear that, Inspector?
You can't let him get away with it!

51:44.457 --> 51:46.704
Inspector, don't let him get away with that!

51:46.903 --> 51:47.924
You tell him!

51:50.390 --> 51:53.970
I believe we can arrange to accomodate Mr. Houdini.

51:54.013 --> 51:55.513
Thank you very much, Inspector,

51:55.556 --> 51:58.506
but it'll have to be in the morning
before I have a matinee tomorrow.

51:58.606 --> 51:59.616
Very good.

51:59.659 --> 52:01.879
- There's one condition however.
- Yes, sir.

52:01.922 --> 52:03.422
Unless you can escape

52:03.465 --> 52:05.965
you'll remain locked up for 24 hours.

52:06.285 --> 52:07.354
<i>Haha! Bravo!</i>

52:07.397 --> 52:08.970
I have never missed a performances.

52:09.523 --> 52:11.636
Come and see me here tomorrow afternoon.

52:11.679 --> 52:13.259
Uh, that goes to you, too, Mr. Dooley.

52:13.302 --> 52:16.312
- You won't be here!
- I'll be here! Good night, all!

52:25.807 --> 52:28.927
Oh, you really got that audience steamed up tonight.

52:28.970 --> 52:30.823
That means a packed house tomorrow.

52:33.473 --> 52:34.497
Harry?

52:34.540 --> 52:37.473
I'll have to see the manager about
better billing, increase the salary...

52:37.516 --> 52:38.626
- Harry.
- What?

52:38.866 --> 52:40.902
What happens if you can't get out tomorrow?

52:41.942 --> 52:44.097
I could open that locks with a button hook.

52:44.608 --> 52:46.015
I hope so.

52:46.061 --> 52:47.081
Yeah?

52:49.250 --> 52:51.743
- Went great, didn't it, yank?
- You should've been an actor.

52:51.786 --> 52:53.013
I wasn't so bad, was I?

52:53.056 --> 52:55.376
Say, how big is the chance that we'll get into the papers?

52:55.418 --> 52:59.364
Look, you just get out of that jail, Mr. Houdini,
and I'll guarantee that you make the front page.

52:59.407 --> 53:00.593
I'll get out.

53:00.948 --> 53:02.173
You gonna need a picture.

53:03.907 --> 53:05.980
- Which one?
- Uh, I like this one.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.267
And play it up big.

53:08.637 --> 53:11.443
Ah, now I'd trouble you for that £ 2.

53:11.486 --> 53:13.846
Well, I'll give it to you tomorrow,
right after the matinee.

53:13.889 --> 53:15.596
Look, yank, old boy,

53:16.155 --> 53:18.336
my end of the bargain was to get you in jail.

53:18.379 --> 53:19.972
You promised me £ 2.

53:20.185 --> 53:23.118
I want it now because tomorrow
you might not be here to pay me.

53:24.126 --> 53:25.198
Harry.

53:28.954 --> 53:29.985
Thank you.

53:31.350 --> 53:33.983
Oh, and by the way, I forgot to tell you

53:34.026 --> 53:36.765
that in our jails the cells are built
different than in the States.

53:36.836 --> 53:38.762
The locks aren't in the doors

53:39.042 --> 53:40.189
Good luck, yank.

53:53.357 --> 53:56.350
I assure, Inspector, my jail is escape-proofed.

53:56.456 --> 53:58.817
Mr. Houdini seems to think otherwise.

53:59.283 --> 54:01.736
We shall see. We shall see.

54:01.945 --> 54:03.703
As you can see, Inspector,

54:03.797 --> 54:05.918
you can look too, Mr. Houdini,

54:05.961 --> 54:07.864
this is no ordinary cell block.

54:10.514 --> 54:13.107
The lock can only be opened from the outside.

54:13.633 --> 54:16.332
And you can't reach it from inside the cell.

54:21.568 --> 54:23.075
Do you still want to try?

54:27.718 --> 54:31.198
Keys won't help you, Mr. Houdini, but we'll make sure.

54:31.425 --> 54:32.645
I'll take the hat

54:33.015 --> 54:34.267
and the coat.

54:36.764 --> 54:37.971
Let's have the belt.

54:42.057 --> 54:43.277
Open your mouth.

54:47.278 --> 54:49.815
The pin, and the tie.

54:50.750 --> 54:52.403
Now let's have the shoes, too.

54:53.678 --> 54:55.943
I have heard about these trick-heels.

54:58.297 --> 55:00.270
Alright, then, left your pockets out.

55:04.850 --> 55:05.923
Turn around.

55:12.601 --> 55:15.029
And just so you'll have something to play with,

55:15.207 --> 55:17.938
here's some nice pretty bracelets for ya.

55:20.224 --> 55:21.785
Now, Mr. Houdini,

55:22.275 --> 55:24.971
your things will be right outside the door.

55:25.248 --> 55:26.798
In case you make it..

55:28.179 --> 55:31.628
Don't worry, we'll see you in 24 hours.

55:31.671 --> 55:32.998
We won't let you starve.

55:33.041 --> 55:35.194
Tea is twelve to four, and dinner at six.

55:35.536 --> 55:36.620
Good luck, yank.

55:37.914 --> 55:40.311
- Warden.
- Yes, what is it?

55:42.200 --> 55:44.254
Maybe you can use them on someone else.

55:45.276 --> 55:48.013
We'll see who'll the last laugh, Mr. Houdini!

55:55.781 --> 55:56.949
No getting there.

55:57.299 --> 55:58.569
I've tried.

55:58.825 --> 56:00.095
You can't do it.

58:07.069 --> 58:11.322
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- We want Houdini! Come on! We want Houdini!

58:11.602 --> 58:15.182
We want Houdini! We want Houdini!

58:15.225 --> 58:20.161
We want Houdini! We want Houdini! We want Houdini!

58:20.203 --> 58:23.286
Please! Please, ladies and gentlemen.

58:23.693 --> 58:26.499
Due to circumstances beyond our control

58:26.619 --> 58:29.579
Mr. Houdini has been unavoidably detained.

58:29.760 --> 58:33.179
- We know! He's in our jail!
- Right you are!

58:33.873 --> 58:36.233
Please! Please, I...

58:36.276 --> 58:37.996
I know how you feel.

58:38.319 --> 58:41.643
While Mr. Houdini can not appear before you in person,

58:42.156 --> 58:44.196
he will not disappoint you.

58:45.536 --> 58:47.908
Well, where is he? Where is he?

58:49.856 --> 58:51.496
Please! Please.

58:52.116 --> 58:54.636
He is sending his alter ego

58:54.822 --> 58:58.249
from the spiritual world to take his place, and...

58:58.542 --> 59:00.463
we will need complete silence

59:00.506 --> 59:02.676
if Mr. Houdini's alter ego

59:02.719 --> 59:04.176
is to appear.

59:46.712 --> 59:48.310
It's impossible!

59:51.733 --> 59:53.786
Just a minute! Just a minute!

59:54.186 --> 59:55.553
Mr. Houdini,

59:55.663 --> 59:57.636
maybe you got out of our jail,

59:57.682 --> 01:00:00.929
but I've got something you can't get out from.

01:00:04.774 --> 01:00:05.827
Wait!

01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:07.891
Put out your hands.

01:00:08.717 --> 01:00:10.140
Put out your hands!

01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:27.679
Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:00:28.176 --> 01:00:30.146
nobody can get out of these cuffs!

01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:33.185
I've made them myself and there ain't no key!

01:00:33.515 --> 01:00:36.485
The only way to get them off is saw them off!

01:00:38.788 --> 01:00:43.014
Anybody who wants to go out for a bit of
fish and chips shall have plenty of time!

01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:02.708
Are you willing to stay there for the night?

01:01:04.141 --> 01:01:05.281
I say he is.

01:01:16.827 --> 01:01:19.401
- Where's me handcuffs?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:29.298 --> 01:01:30.731
Mr. Houdini,

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:33.281
let me be the first to congratulate you.

01:01:33.324 --> 01:01:37.587
It seems that our escape-proofed jail
has a bit of a hole in it.

01:02:35.493 --> 01:02:40.203
Mr. Houdini, we've had our operator checked
every Von Schweger in the Berlin telephone book,

01:02:40.246 --> 01:02:42.532
but none of them seem to be the one you're looking for.

01:02:42.575 --> 01:02:43.626
Thank you very much.

01:02:44.256 --> 01:02:46.929
All these letters that I sent to him
come back the same way.

01:02:47.076 --> 01:02:49.322
Address unknown, does not live at this address...

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.085
Why don't you forget it, Harry?

01:03:01.758 --> 01:03:03.138
- I...
- Hm?

01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:05.634
I bet you've forgotten what day this is.

01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:06.927
But I haven't.

01:03:07.058 --> 01:03:08.254
It's my birthday.

01:03:09.054 --> 01:03:10.994
Oh, I thought, sure you would forget.

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:12.414
I'd like to.

01:03:12.457 --> 01:03:15.714
- Say, have you noticed all the grey hairs?
- Would you like a surprise?

01:03:15.757 --> 01:03:17.043
Not particularly.

01:03:17.698 --> 01:03:20.485
Well, you're going to get one,
wether you like it or not.

01:03:53.165 --> 01:03:54.205
Thank you.

01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:57.471
My dance, I believe?

01:04:32.758 --> 01:04:33.962
That's my girl!

01:04:34.308 --> 01:04:35.755
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:35.798 --> 01:04:37.635
may I have your attention, please?

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:42.467
As you know, the gentleman in the middle
of the floor is Houdini, the great magician.

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:47.627
Maybe if we try hard enough we can get him
to do one of his famous tricks for us.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:48.727
Shall we try?

01:04:51.442 --> 01:04:53.234
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.

01:04:53.277 --> 01:04:55.263
I hadn't planned a performance tonight,

01:04:55.404 --> 01:04:57.697
but maybe I have something that will amuse you.

01:04:57.823 --> 01:04:59.862
So, if you get me a couple of brooms,

01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:01.419
I'll get my wife and...

01:05:01.762 --> 01:05:03.559
we will see what we can do.

01:05:12.805 --> 01:05:13.806
Thank you.

01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:15.988
And now, if you'd bring the music platform, please?

01:05:16.648 --> 01:05:19.096
I'll need the aid of a few gentlemen from the audience.

01:05:19.139 --> 01:05:20.146
Would you, sir?

01:05:20.695 --> 01:05:21.988
And the young officer.

01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:26.961
Would you take this broom and hold it
at the edge of the platform?

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.487
Would you do the same thing?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.027
Now hold them both very securely.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:33.100
Bess.

01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:37.775
- Would you put your arms on the brooms?
- Like this - Yes.

01:05:37.862 --> 01:05:39.615
I've to get my cape out of the way.

01:05:39.962 --> 01:05:41.828
Make yourself as comfortable as possible.

01:05:42.835 --> 01:05:43.855
There.

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:46.956
You look very lovely tonight.

01:05:46.999 --> 01:05:49.196
- It's a shame to put you to sleep.
- I don't mind.

01:05:49.239 --> 01:05:50.252
- You're ready?
- Yes.

01:05:50.295 --> 01:05:52.087
All right. Concentrate on my hand.

01:05:52.602 --> 01:05:53.701
Concentrate.

01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:55.175
You're getting sleepy.

01:05:55.631 --> 01:05:56.975
You're getting sleepy.

01:05:57.303 --> 01:06:00.587
- Happy Birthday.
- Sleep! Sleep.

01:06:01.143 --> 01:06:02.177
Sleep.

01:06:02.515 --> 01:06:04.297
You can take that broom away now.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:10.424
Relax your arm. Relax. Relax.

01:06:10.719 --> 01:06:11.951
Rest your head.

01:06:13.313 --> 01:06:15.960
Sleep. Sleep.

01:06:17.404 --> 01:06:19.036
Now, if you'd help me lift her?

01:06:21.857 --> 01:06:23.244
Up. Up, up, up!

01:06:25.597 --> 01:06:26.617
There.

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:29.763
You can let go now.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.221
And I let go.

01:06:37.798 --> 01:06:39.263
And would you let go?

01:06:46.201 --> 01:06:48.359
Would you pass that broom underneath, please?

01:06:50.495 --> 01:06:51.648
And over.

01:06:57.686 --> 01:07:00.119
I don't recommend this as an after-dinner-trick.

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.577
- Are you Herr Houdini?
- Yes.

01:07:09.838 --> 01:07:14.584
You will appear before the tribunal
tomorrow at 10 to answer these charges.

01:07:18.724 --> 01:07:19.937
What charges?

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.120
It seems I've been labeled a fraud by the Kaiser's court.

01:07:23.279 --> 01:07:24.905
I might have to go to jail.

01:07:26.032 --> 01:07:28.312
You'll get me down before you go, will you?

01:07:28.805 --> 01:07:29.845
Go back to sleep.

01:07:29.888 --> 01:07:31.791
Oh, would you help me to lower her, please?

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.274
Gently.

01:07:34.255 --> 01:07:35.268
Easy.

01:07:36.088 --> 01:07:37.095
That's it.

01:07:39.984 --> 01:07:40.984
There.

01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:43.990
When I snap my fingers you will awaken.

01:07:50.895 --> 01:07:53.375
When any magician

01:07:53.975 --> 01:07:56.888
transgresses the bounds of reason

01:07:57.275 --> 01:07:59.042
and humbugs the people

01:07:59.085 --> 01:08:02.286
into not only thinking but believing
that he is supernatural,

01:08:02.408 --> 01:08:05.004
then this man becomes a menace to society.

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:07.752
and must be restrained from further practice
of such deception.

01:08:08.703 --> 01:08:11.047
Will the defendant rise?

01:08:12.008 --> 01:08:14.576
How do you answer these charges?

01:08:15.226 --> 01:08:17.444
I have never claimed to be supernatural.

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:21.752
All my escapes have been effected
by purely physical means.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.029
I see only one way to resolve this point.

01:08:26.608 --> 01:08:28.662
If both parties will agree

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:31.682
we will put it to a test right in this court.

01:08:32.246 --> 01:08:34.832
I will submit to any test Your Honor chooses.

01:08:35.282 --> 01:08:38.511
The prosecution agrees to a test.

01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:39.560
Very well.

01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:42.441
The courtroom will recess for 30 minutes.

01:08:53.536 --> 01:08:58.033
The combination of this safe is known only to myself

01:08:58.322 --> 01:08:59.696
and my bailiff.

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:02.502
Now, if Mr. Houdini can open the safe

01:09:02.932 --> 01:09:04.782
right in this courtroom,

01:09:05.548 --> 01:09:08.283
I will dismiss the charges against him.

01:09:08.764 --> 01:09:10.214
Uh, just a moment.

01:09:10.274 --> 01:09:12.144
Your Honor, I will do better than that.

01:09:12.187 --> 01:09:14.759
You can lock me inside the safe, and I'll get out.

01:09:15.233 --> 01:09:19.069
Mr. Houdini, I only ask you to open it.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:20.564
I'll get out.

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:26.341
- Remember the last safe you got into.
- I knew you'd think of that.

01:09:29.803 --> 01:09:30.996
Lock it up!

01:09:33.585 --> 01:09:36.158
Come on, lock it up. What are you waiting for?

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:14.345
Aren't you worried?

01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:47.638
It's pretty hot in there.

01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:50.603
Wonderful! Wonderful, Mr. Houdini! Marvelous!

01:10:51.408 --> 01:10:53.238
Yes, very good.

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:56.434
<i>Mr. Houdini, congratulations.</i>

01:11:00.444 --> 01:11:04.771
But Harry never saw that safe before.
How did he ever do it? What is the trick?

01:11:04.814 --> 01:11:07.814
The trick, Mama, was to get the judge
to lock him in the safe.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.000
Safes were built to keep people from breaking in,
not out.

01:11:35.576 --> 01:11:36.603
Hello?

01:11:40.799 --> 01:11:42.246
Anybody here?

01:11:48.057 --> 01:11:49.126
Hello?

01:11:50.259 --> 01:11:51.699
Is anyone here?

01:12:06.166 --> 01:12:07.179
Hello?

01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:11.169
Hello?

01:12:11.212 --> 01:12:12.399
You are too late.

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.024
Herr Von Schweger died two days ago.

01:12:20.631 --> 01:12:22.013
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:24.777
I was in Switzerland when I got his letter.

01:12:25.101 --> 01:12:26.967
I came as quickly as I could.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.960
He was very anxious to talk to you.

01:12:29.073 --> 01:12:31.599
I've been trying to see him ever since I came to Europe.

01:12:31.998 --> 01:12:33.039
I know.

01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:35.207
He made me send your letters back.

01:12:35.779 --> 01:12:38.816
So many magicians over the years have tried to see him.

01:12:39.353 --> 01:12:41.953
You are the first to whom he gave an appointment.

01:12:42.243 --> 01:12:44.034
What made him decide to see me?

01:12:44.883 --> 01:12:49.215
Herr Von Schweger had no patience with
magicians who could do only tricks.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.823
He made me follow your European tour very closely.

01:12:54.479 --> 01:12:56.646
When he was convinced that you are worthy,

01:12:57.018 --> 01:12:59.025
he finally agreed that he would talk to you.

01:12:59.405 --> 01:13:01.298
Do you know what he wanted to tell me?

01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:03.658
He had nothing to tell you.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:10.442
He wanted to ask you if you knew
the secret of how to dematerialize.

01:13:10.649 --> 01:13:11.655
Me?

01:13:11.775 --> 01:13:13.775
But I heard that he had already done it.

01:13:15.375 --> 01:13:17.661
It happened before I became his assistant.

01:13:17.965 --> 01:13:19.065
I asked him,

01:13:19.371 --> 01:13:21.580
but he would neither admit it nor deny it.

01:13:21.935 --> 01:13:23.475
At one thing I'm sure of:

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:25.435
He was never able to repeat it.

01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:26.748
I know

01:13:27.039 --> 01:13:30.244
because I helped him spend the rest of his life trying.

01:13:37.544 --> 01:13:39.566
He intended to give you this.

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:49.143
Well...

01:13:50.855 --> 01:13:51.902
Shall we go?

01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:54.623
Go?

01:13:56.062 --> 01:13:57.149
Go where?

01:13:57.404 --> 01:13:58.671
Otto is my name.

01:13:59.288 --> 01:14:00.958
Now I am working for you.

01:14:01.931 --> 01:14:05.679
- But I'll be leaving for America before long.
- So? You will need me.

01:14:09.504 --> 01:14:12.743
Looks like Von Schweger left me more
than just a man in a bottle.

01:14:21.313 --> 01:14:23.406
Editor of The New York Observer, New York City

01:14:23.449 --> 01:14:27.232
<i>Returning from his European Tour,
Houdini requests the pleasure of your company</i>

01:14:27.275 --> 01:14:29.539
<i>at his home on Tuesday, September 3rd, at 2 p.m.</i>

01:14:47.509 --> 01:14:48.996
I can't understand it.

01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:51.534
It's 15:30, and they were invited for 14:00.

01:14:51.816 --> 01:14:54.002
Are you sure you send out the invitations, Bess?

01:14:54.045 --> 01:14:58.377
I delivered the invitations myself
to every newspaper in town.

01:14:59.043 --> 01:15:00.949
Then why haven't a reporter showen up?

01:15:00.992 --> 01:15:03.318
Maybe they do not know who you are, Harry.

01:15:03.535 --> 01:15:05.674
Everybody knows who I am, Mama.

01:15:05.978 --> 01:15:07.345
Look at those.

01:15:07.388 --> 01:15:11.034
But that was in Europe, Harry. Americans
are different. You have to show them.

01:15:11.514 --> 01:15:12.961
Mama is right.

01:15:13.004 --> 01:15:14.779
No one met us on the boat.

01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:16.270
Otto,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.947
if the press won't come to me, I shall go to the press.

01:15:20.487 --> 01:15:22.007
Get my straitjacket.

01:15:36.005 --> 01:15:37.085
Go away!

01:16:22.956 --> 01:16:24.149
Remarkable fellow.

01:16:24.483 --> 01:16:26.276
I'm going to interview him today.

01:17:08.508 --> 01:17:10.636
Do you remember when he worked for us?

01:17:10.679 --> 01:17:11.772
You fired him!

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:16.018
- I fired him?
- Shut up!

01:17:48.944 --> 01:17:52.162
I know it's not of my business,
but does he really like this sort of thing?

01:17:52.238 --> 01:17:55.905
Certainly. That's why he's going to jump
into the Detroit River tomorrow.

01:17:57.578 --> 01:18:00.771
- Do you think you'll need any more, sir?
- No, thank you, that will be enough.

01:18:02.395 --> 01:18:03.705
Thank you, sir.

01:18:13.849 --> 01:18:16.623
Oh! Get out of that tub!

01:18:16.666 --> 01:18:18.399
I've got to get used to it.

01:18:18.442 --> 01:18:20.452
Otto, get him out of there!

01:18:24.674 --> 01:18:27.781
What are you trying to do?
Do you wanna catch pneumonia?

01:18:27.824 --> 01:18:29.734
Here, let me get that wet swimsuit you wear.

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:32.164
I've gotta... I've gotta practice.

01:18:32.247 --> 01:18:33.757
You're practicing for nothing.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.080
The Detroit River is completely frozen.

01:18:36.207 --> 01:18:37.933
No one will expect you to jump.

01:18:37.976 --> 01:18:41.069
But the theater is advertising it for weeks.
I can't back out now!

01:18:41.112 --> 01:18:43.058
You have to call it off!

01:18:43.334 --> 01:18:45.085
It's below zero outside.

01:18:45.128 --> 01:18:47.074
That ice will be a foot thick.

01:18:47.861 --> 01:18:49.394
They'll cut a hole in the ice.

01:18:50.224 --> 01:18:51.487
Oh! Well, that's crazy.

01:18:51.767 --> 01:18:53.327
If you jump, I'm jumping with you!

01:18:55.005 --> 01:18:58.421
If I had you with me under that ice,
I bet we could set a new record.

01:18:59.116 --> 01:19:01.775
- Do you know what day it is tomorrow?
- Yes, Thursday.

01:19:01.922 --> 01:19:04.715
It's Halloween. That's not your day.

01:19:07.574 --> 01:19:09.472
To me it's just another Thursday.

01:20:34.106 --> 01:20:35.186
<i>The chain broke.</i>

01:20:55.497 --> 01:20:56.530
<i>Stand back!</i>

01:21:21.103 --> 01:21:23.556
- His wife's coming through, please.
- Excuse me.

01:21:54.525 --> 01:21:56.071
Otto, I know he's in trouble.

01:21:56.218 --> 01:21:57.900
He should be out by now!

01:22:03.324 --> 01:22:05.446
He's never been under that long before!

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:07.703
Grab the hooks.

01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:09.885
Let the rope down.

01:22:10.613 --> 01:22:11.619
Quickly!

01:22:16.211 --> 01:22:17.565
Drob those hooks in.

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:23.597
It's empty! He's not in there!

01:23:30.837 --> 01:23:32.331
Take her to the hotel.

01:23:37.192 --> 01:23:38.506
Drob those hooks in!

01:23:38.636 --> 01:23:40.208
He may be able to see them.

01:23:41.826 --> 01:23:43.586
Lower! Lower!

01:23:43.812 --> 01:23:45.446
Lower! Lower!

01:23:46.339 --> 01:23:49.792
- Nobody could come out of there alive.
- I guess we got a headline. - Yeah.

01:23:57.077 --> 01:23:58.604
<i>Get your late Extra!</i>

01:23:58.717 --> 01:24:00.117
<i>Extra paper!</i>

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.377
<i>Extra! Extra!</i>

01:24:01.513 --> 01:24:03.400
<i>Houdini lost in Detroit River!</i>

01:24:03.468 --> 01:24:06.334
<i>Extra paper! Get your late Extra!</i>

01:24:06.377 --> 01:24:08.603
<i>Houdini disapperaed in Detroit River!</i>

01:24:08.646 --> 01:24:09.830
<i>Extra paper!</i>

01:24:22.805 --> 01:24:23.831
Harry!

01:24:24.258 --> 01:24:25.285
Darling!

01:24:25.844 --> 01:24:26.864
Harry!

01:24:27.403 --> 01:24:28.410
Oh, Harry!

01:24:29.614 --> 01:24:31.366
Darling, you are alive!

01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:32.511
Yes, Bess.

01:24:33.064 --> 01:24:34.744
I'm all right, Bess.

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:41.995
Don't cry. No. I'm all right.

01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:47.168
I didn't think about the river's current.

01:24:47.755 --> 01:24:49.021
It carried me downstream.

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.381
I thought I'd never find the opening.

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:55.761
Then I heard my mother's voice calling.

01:24:57.901 --> 01:24:59.714
I swam towards it's sound and...

01:25:01.324 --> 01:25:03.067
found the opening in the ice.

01:25:06.341 --> 01:25:09.301
Oh, you're safe. Thank god, you're safe.

01:25:09.421 --> 01:25:11.947
Do not cry, Bess. I'll never leave you.

01:25:12.127 --> 01:25:13.601
I'll never leave you.

01:25:30.704 --> 01:25:31.738
Hello?

01:25:33.464 --> 01:25:36.844
Yes, he is. Long distant. Just a moment.

01:25:39.904 --> 01:25:40.918
Hello?

01:25:41.957 --> 01:25:43.718
Yes, this is Harry Houdini.

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.243
What time did she die?

01:26:03.886 --> 01:26:05.992
Yes, we'll take the first train home.

01:26:15.756 --> 01:26:18.170
Mother died the time I heard her calling.

01:26:20.834 --> 01:26:24.241
Oh, my darling. My poor, poor darling.

01:26:28.136 --> 01:26:29.630
<i>Just a minute, please.</i>

01:26:31.203 --> 01:26:32.230
Pardon me.

01:26:35.706 --> 01:26:37.503
Hmm. Good subject.

01:26:38.119 --> 01:26:40.041
You know, Houdini, don't you, Simms?

01:26:40.084 --> 01:26:41.374
I've interviewed him.

01:26:41.417 --> 01:26:42.996
Then what's happened to him?

01:26:43.290 --> 01:26:46.956
Why should a man at the height of his career
go off the site for 2 whole years?

01:26:47.256 --> 01:26:51.296
Well, when his mother died,
he canceled his tour and went into seclusion.

01:26:52.211 --> 01:26:54.030
He didn't see anybody, not even me.

01:26:54.158 --> 01:26:57.124
A man like that just couldn't be idle.
He must be up to something.

01:26:58.034 --> 01:26:59.471
Find out what it is.

01:27:14.845 --> 01:27:15.852
Mr. Houdini.

01:27:17.225 --> 01:27:19.439
- Why, it's Mr. Simms from the Observer.
- That's right.

01:27:19.482 --> 01:27:23.122
- I wanna speak to you for a moment.
- I'm sorry, but we're just leaving for an appointment.

01:27:23.165 --> 01:27:26.085
- If you could just answer a few questions?
- Some other time, we're late.

01:27:26.127 --> 01:27:28.078
Look, after all you owe me something.

01:27:28.101 --> 01:27:31.593
I was the only reporter who covered
your straitjacket escape. Remember?

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.333
- Get in.
- Thank you.

01:27:38.713 --> 01:27:41.543
I'm doing a feature story on you in our sunday supplement.

01:27:41.586 --> 01:27:43.473
I wanna bring the article up to date.

01:27:43.786 --> 01:27:45.326
The past two years are blank.

01:27:45.713 --> 01:27:47.793
They've been a blank to me, too, Mr. Simms.

01:27:47.933 --> 01:27:49.233
How do you mean that?

01:27:49.656 --> 01:27:51.320
Do you believe in the hereafter?

01:27:52.326 --> 01:27:53.606
I guess so.

01:27:53.779 --> 01:27:56.406
Almost everyone believe there's
something beyond this life.

01:27:56.449 --> 01:27:58.086
I've been trying to make contact.

01:27:59.694 --> 01:28:02.194
You mean to try to communicate with someone who's dead?

01:28:02.927 --> 01:28:04.034
Exactly that.

01:28:04.203 --> 01:28:05.246
With my mother.

01:28:05.457 --> 01:28:06.750
That's impossible.

01:28:06.913 --> 01:28:07.930
Why?

01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:09.656
Because it's never been done?

01:28:10.166 --> 01:28:13.083
You just said you believe in something beyond this life.

01:28:13.303 --> 01:28:15.729
If there is, there must be some way to reach it.

01:28:16.086 --> 01:28:18.523
There is, by dying.

01:28:18.816 --> 01:28:20.208
That closes the door.

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:22.536
I wanna open it.

01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:25.779
Is that what you've been doing for 2 years?

01:28:25.822 --> 01:28:27.386
Yes, with no success.

01:28:27.429 --> 01:28:29.348
Tonight we're going to try again.

01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:31.208
Would you like to come along?

01:28:31.563 --> 01:28:32.596
Me?

01:28:32.993 --> 01:28:36.436
- Well, uh, my editor...
- You're not afraid, Mr. Simms?

01:28:39.362 --> 01:28:40.939
Certainly not. I...

01:28:44.388 --> 01:28:45.701
Come in, spirits.

01:28:48.243 --> 01:28:49.687
Come in, spirits.

01:29:02.953 --> 01:29:04.313
Yes, spirit?

01:29:17.885 --> 01:29:19.345
Hey. Calm down.

01:30:24.165 --> 01:30:26.832
Was there a materialization?

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.558
It sure was something.

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.245
You didn't see it?

01:30:30.807 --> 01:30:34.220
When I go into a trance I see or hear nothing.

01:30:34.795 --> 01:30:39.668
I must rely on those present
if the séance was a success or not.

01:30:39.814 --> 01:30:41.240
Well, I heard music.

01:30:41.787 --> 01:30:42.974
Sounded like a...

01:30:43.554 --> 01:30:44.894
Hungarian waltz.

01:30:45.502 --> 01:30:49.795
And there was a woman's image in the garden.

01:30:50.564 --> 01:30:53.270
Do these things have any significance?

01:30:53.924 --> 01:30:56.350
That waltz was my mother's favorite song.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.547
The image in the garden did have a resemblance to mother.

01:31:01.077 --> 01:31:03.495
Then we're indeed fortunate, Mr. Houdini.

01:31:03.985 --> 01:31:06.690
Most first séances produce nothing.

01:31:07.257 --> 01:31:09.417
It usually takes several

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.827
before the recepted vibration

01:31:11.977 --> 01:31:14.913
is established to contact the other side.

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.873
As a newspaper reporter, Mr. Simms,

01:31:19.029 --> 01:31:21.583
I'd be pleased to know your impression.

01:31:23.646 --> 01:31:26.486
Well, in my drinking days I could explain it.

01:31:26.653 --> 01:31:28.893
You saw what the others saw.

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:31.969
Yeah, but it had no significance for me.

01:31:32.332 --> 01:31:33.876
It wasn't meant to.

01:31:34.306 --> 01:31:37.559
But it did mean something to the Houdinis.

01:31:40.768 --> 01:31:42.881
I'm quite exhausted.

01:31:43.151 --> 01:31:44.747
If you will excuse me.

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:45.901
Don't go yet.

01:31:46.045 --> 01:31:47.704
The spell is broken.

01:31:48.095 --> 01:31:50.138
We can do no more this evening.

01:31:58.977 --> 01:32:01.041
Alright, Otto, you can let him go.

01:32:03.028 --> 01:32:04.866
Well, what do you know.

01:32:05.031 --> 01:32:06.934
There should be a microphone up...

01:32:10.472 --> 01:32:11.893
Now, where is the music?

01:32:29.855 --> 01:32:32.018
Well, Otto, it looks like we've drawn another blank.

01:32:32.061 --> 01:32:33.740
You mean all mediums are fakes?

01:32:33.783 --> 01:32:37.620
No, I'm sure there are those that are sincere
and believe in what they are doing.

01:32:38.285 --> 01:32:39.778
I just haven't found them.

01:32:40.702 --> 01:32:41.933
Shall we go, dear?

01:32:46.369 --> 01:32:47.753
Take that thing off!

01:32:50.374 --> 01:32:52.498
HOUDINI EXPOSES FRAUDULENT MEDIUMS

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.522
HOUDINI OFFERS $ 25,000 FOR PROOF
OF CONTACT WITH SPIRIT WORLD

01:33:06.342 --> 01:33:08.195
HOUDINI RETURNS TO MAGIC

01:33:28.051 --> 01:33:29.628
Oh, Mrs. Houdini!

01:33:29.824 --> 01:33:32.168
- Yes?
- Mr. Houdini is not in the theater.

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:33.531
Well, where is he?

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:36.250
You'll find him over at
Sherman's Ironwoods on 14th Street.

01:33:36.293 --> 01:33:37.293
Oh, thank you.

01:33:46.695 --> 01:33:49.127
Is this why you kept me in the country all week, huh?

01:33:49.974 --> 01:33:53.439
So you and Otto could get this, uh, thing wigged.

01:33:53.541 --> 01:33:57.013
You don't have to get so upset.
We just wanted to see if it were workable.

01:33:57.334 --> 01:33:59.281
Don't lie to me, Harry.

01:33:59.324 --> 01:34:02.354
I've been to the theater.
It's postered all over the front.

01:34:03.234 --> 01:34:06.194
I've done water escapes before.
This is nothing different.

01:34:07.354 --> 01:34:09.207
Nothing different?

01:34:10.607 --> 01:34:13.607
It's an exact copy of Von Schweger's man in the bottle.

01:34:14.031 --> 01:34:18.028
It's what killed him. Don't you understand, Harry?
It's what killed him.

01:34:18.672 --> 01:34:21.159
I haven't played to an audience in 2 years.

01:34:21.586 --> 01:34:23.509
I've got to give them something new!

01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:25.975
But why it will have to be this?

01:34:26.017 --> 01:34:28.638
It'll be the most spectacular thing I've ever done.

01:34:29.469 --> 01:34:30.918
And the most dangerous.

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:35.191
Bess, people aren't gonna stand in line
and watch me pull rabbits out of a hat.

01:34:35.645 --> 01:34:36.658
Why...

01:34:36.897 --> 01:34:39.756
Why must every act you do be flirting with death?

01:34:40.337 --> 01:34:43.530
Because it's the only act
that'll hold an audience spellbound.

01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:45.330
People fall asleep at the opera,

01:34:45.373 --> 01:34:47.393
but they stay wide awake at the bullfights

01:34:47.446 --> 01:34:50.880
because there's one man defying death down in that arena.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.242
You take this out of my act and I'm nothing!

01:34:53.285 --> 01:34:55.505
You keep it in and we're both nothing!

01:34:59.058 --> 01:35:02.378
Otto, have this send down to the theater.
We'll test it for tomorrow's performance.

01:35:05.879 --> 01:35:07.793
What are you standing there for?

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:54.586
What are you doing here?

01:35:54.826 --> 01:35:57.066
I didn't want you to be without an audience.

01:35:59.652 --> 01:36:01.672
- Cut it out!
- Why?

01:36:01.762 --> 01:36:03.349
It's what you lived for, isn't it?

01:36:03.729 --> 01:36:05.229
What do you want me to do?

01:36:05.272 --> 01:36:07.270
The house is sold out for tomorrow night.

01:36:07.598 --> 01:36:10.014
Wherever you go the house will be sold out.

01:36:10.424 --> 01:36:12.712
You make it sound like something terrible.

01:36:13.377 --> 01:36:14.383
It is.

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.987
People paying a dollar to see a man in love with death.

01:36:18.534 --> 01:36:20.173
That's crazy talk!

01:36:20.954 --> 01:36:24.520
I wish it was another woman that took
you from me, Harry! That I could fight!

01:36:24.957 --> 01:36:26.127
This I can't.

01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:27.362
Bess, wait!

01:36:37.443 --> 01:36:40.043
- Bess, you've got to listen to me!
- If I listen, I'll get angry.

01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:42.606
- What are you trying to do to me?
- I'm trying not to lose you.

01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:46.569
- How? By walking out on me?
- Yes! Maybe without me you won't go on.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.248
Without you I wouldn't wanna go on.

01:37:10.315 --> 01:37:13.128
- Alright, Bess, I won't do it.
- Oh, Harry.

01:37:13.171 --> 01:37:15.217
- I'll cut it out of the act.
- Okay.

01:37:20.759 --> 01:37:23.665
- It still hurts you there, doesn't it?
- It's alright.

01:37:23.739 --> 01:37:26.025
You should've taken care of that a long time ago.

01:37:26.068 --> 01:37:27.932
It's nothing. It comes and goes.

01:37:28.039 --> 01:37:29.819
I think it's your appendix.

01:37:29.862 --> 01:37:32.088
Since when have you been practicing medicine, Otto?

01:37:32.131 --> 01:37:36.018
Ah, you don't have to be a doctor
to know that something's wrong.

01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:40.157
- All right.
- I'll have it looked as soon as we finish the tour.

01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:45.336
20, 21, 22.

01:37:49.661 --> 01:37:51.329
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:37:51.386 --> 01:37:53.925
as you read in the newspapers this morning

01:37:54.279 --> 01:37:56.199
Houdini has been challenged

01:37:56.242 --> 01:37:59.488
to liberate himself from a sealed straightjacket.

01:37:59.689 --> 01:38:00.715
That's it.

01:38:01.202 --> 01:38:04.890
Will the gentleman who has the straightjacket
please walk up on the stage?

01:38:07.135 --> 01:38:08.207
Thank you.

01:38:09.881 --> 01:38:11.292
Come forward, gentlemen.

01:38:12.342 --> 01:38:13.362
Gentlemen,

01:38:13.582 --> 01:38:16.768
have you ever met Houdini or myself before?

01:38:16.811 --> 01:38:17.962
No, never.

01:38:18.884 --> 01:38:22.364
I understand that you made this conception yourself.

01:38:22.407 --> 01:38:26.726
- Yes, in our shop. We have every confidence in it.
- And we don't think he can get out of it.

01:38:26.769 --> 01:38:27.789
Oh!

01:38:28.113 --> 01:38:31.380
So, if you do not think he can get out of it,
and you made it yourself,

01:38:31.423 --> 01:38:33.363
perhaps you'd better put him into it.

01:38:33.919 --> 01:38:35.839
Well, here goes the coat again.

01:38:40.079 --> 01:38:41.099
Put your arms in here.

01:38:41.812 --> 01:38:42.826
Thank you.

01:38:43.165 --> 01:38:44.772
Now, if you'd turn around, please.

01:38:53.989 --> 01:38:55.117
Turn around again.

01:38:55.444 --> 01:38:58.737
Now you put your wrists right in... like that.
That's right.

01:39:02.471 --> 01:39:04.631
Looks as if you got me pretty well locked up.

01:39:04.674 --> 01:39:07.031
- It'll hold you all right.
- My Cape, please!

01:39:07.864 --> 01:39:10.257
- Would you hold this in front of me?
- Oh, yes, surely.

01:39:11.977 --> 01:39:13.024
Ah,

01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:15.887
- it's a little too high.
- Oh, sorry. - Thank you.

01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:18.996
- How long did it take you to make this?
- Uh, about a month. - Uh-huh.

01:39:19.039 --> 01:39:21.039
- Did you use good steel?
- Oh, yes, the very best.

01:39:21.082 --> 01:39:24.642
- Well, some steels are better than others, you know.
- Oh, yes, that's true. - Excuse me.

01:39:26.566 --> 01:39:29.193
I think you got a bad piece, but better luck next time.

01:39:58.611 --> 01:40:00.448
You're really a wonderful audience.

01:40:01.144 --> 01:40:04.491
And I do wanna thank you for this
heart warming welcome you've given me

01:40:04.534 --> 01:40:06.406
on my return to the stage.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.433
I do hope I pleased you

01:40:08.537 --> 01:40:09.993
and that you'll be coming back

01:40:10.036 --> 01:40:12.074
to see me again and again.

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:14.466
And each time you do come back

01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:17.399
I promise you bigger and better thrills.

01:40:17.479 --> 01:40:19.707
Good night and thank you very much.

01:40:24.535 --> 01:40:26.146
What about the Torture Cell?

01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:28.045
Why don't you do what you promised?

01:40:28.559 --> 01:40:31.055
Why don't you do that trick you promised us?

01:40:33.087 --> 01:40:34.373
The Torture Cell!

01:40:35.267 --> 01:40:37.187
You are exhausted. Come.

01:40:39.107 --> 01:40:40.833
<i>We want to see the Torture Cell!</i>

01:40:44.072 --> 01:40:46.449
They are never satisfied. Ignore them.

01:40:46.784 --> 01:40:49.142
- I can't.
- Ha! Close your ears.

01:40:53.062 --> 01:40:54.408
You have given them enough.

01:40:57.995 --> 01:41:00.101
What about the Torture Cell?

01:41:01.798 --> 01:41:04.425
Houdini, what are you going to do?
It's like a madhouse out there.

01:41:04.467 --> 01:41:05.551
They demand another trick.

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:08.713
- Tell them Houdini is sick. Come on.
- Get the Torture Cell ready.

01:41:09.178 --> 01:41:11.751
Harry, you can't! Remember your promise!

01:41:14.933 --> 01:41:17.479
<i>More! More! More!</i>

01:41:17.812 --> 01:41:19.219
<i>More! More!</i>

01:41:33.245 --> 01:41:34.512
The Torture Cell!

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:35.565
<i>More!</i>

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:23.159
Now, will the two gentlemen who helped us before
care to assist us again?

01:42:23.942 --> 01:42:25.120
Come up on the stage.

01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.319
Gentlemen, I have one lock for you, and one for you.

01:42:33.421 --> 01:42:35.061
You come over to this side, sir.

01:42:35.208 --> 01:42:36.295
You there.

01:42:36.781 --> 01:42:38.308
Lock him up securely.

01:42:47.693 --> 01:42:49.026
Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:52.196
Houdini is now prepared
to enter the Pagoda Torture Cell.

01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:03.443
This particular form of escape

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.130
has never been attempted by anyone, anywhere!

01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:09.490
For your information,

01:43:09.586 --> 01:43:12.406
this cell contains 2 tons of water.

01:43:12.679 --> 01:43:15.459
Come up, gentlemen, and get ready to close the locks.

01:43:17.165 --> 01:43:22.094
Fix the locks as soon as Houdini
has been brought into the water.

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:24.332
Are you ready, Houdini?

01:43:29.478 --> 01:43:30.538
Go!

01:43:32.073 --> 01:43:33.485
First the lid.

01:43:35.822 --> 01:43:37.055
5 seconds!

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.950
10 seconds!

01:43:48.332 --> 01:43:49.737
15 seconds!

01:43:52.958 --> 01:43:54.309
20 seconds!

01:43:57.602 --> 01:43:59.094
25 seconds!

01:44:02.323 --> 01:44:03.609
Half a minute!

01:44:29.904 --> 01:44:31.144
Out of the way!

01:44:48.335 --> 01:44:49.576
<i>It's a desaster!</i>

01:44:59.469 --> 01:45:00.502
Darling.

01:45:02.722 --> 01:45:03.736
Harry.

01:45:04.262 --> 01:45:06.969
- Harry, it's Bess.
- Bess? - Yes.

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.400
I'll come back, Bess.

01:45:14.846 --> 01:45:16.146
If there's any way,

01:45:18.755 --> 01:45:19.969
I'll come back.

01:45:22.537 --> 01:45:23.682
I'll come back.
