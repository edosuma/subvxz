WEBVTT

02:30.233 --> 02:31.598
Mr. Roberts?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.768
William Roberts?

02:34.905 --> 02:36.691
Thought you lost me.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.939
You weren't kiddin', were you?

02:42.079 --> 02:43.820
Charles Phalen, sir.

02:44.331 --> 02:48.165
Stackpole, McFee, Lassiter and
Phalen, Attorneys at Law.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.129
How you doing?

03:09.773 --> 03:12.936
So, what is it I can
do for you, sir?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.268
I'm dying,

03:17.698 --> 03:20.440
and I wanna go
before the Governor.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.611
I wanna be pardoned.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.703
Pardoned? For what?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.448
For the killin' of 21 men.

03:30.585 --> 03:35.125
I was promised a pardon 70
years and three months ago.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.664
And you tell him

03:37.676 --> 03:40.919
that you're bringing in
Brushy Bill Roberts,

03:41.680 --> 03:43.717
alias William Antrim,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.591
also known as William H. Bonney.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.059
Whoa, whoa, whoa. William H.
Bonney?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.938
Alias "Billy the Kid."

03:54.484 --> 03:55.815
Billy the Kid, huh?

03:57.446 --> 04:00.905
Billy the Kid was shot and
killed by Pat Garrett.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.524
Everybody knows that.
It's common knowledge.

04:03.535 --> 04:07.995
There are other lawyers around,
you piece of chicken shit.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.957
Get back in your
vehicle and drive

04:11.960 --> 04:15.419
before I make it 22, just
for the goddamn hell of it.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.382
Can you show me some evidence?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.346
Scars or something?
I don't know.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.475
Do you have any scars?

05:21.655 --> 05:24.397
<i>What I'm gonna tell you
is historical fact.</i>

05:24.407 --> 05:28.822
<i>It took place a year after the
great McSween fire of 1878,</i>

05:28.829 --> 05:31.992
<i>what some call the end of
the Lincoln County War.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:32.998
That's him.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.325
When they ask, he drew first.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.995
I got the drop on him.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.370
Say what you will.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.834
I figure to get at least 100
dogies for his trigger finger.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.449
Wait.

06:14.958 --> 06:15.958
Do I know you?

06:17.043 --> 06:20.456
Yeah. Yeah, you know me. You do.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.498
Yeah.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.084
Yeah.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.501
What's your name?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.718
Travers. From Tularosa.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.295
Travers...

06:33.977 --> 06:35.058
No.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.397
Why you just didn't wanna
hide out up in the canyons

06:40.400 --> 06:42.141
don't make the sense
God gave a mule.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.687
I don't know.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.775
Well, now, this here's a dandy.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.666
<i>I'd taken up with
Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh</i>

07:01.880 --> 07:03.996
<i>and Patrick Floyd Garrett.</i>

07:04.633 --> 07:08.843
<i>Me and Garrett had a common interest
in the horse and cattle trade.</i>

07:08.845 --> 07:13.055
<i>And contrary to what they say,
I liked the son of a bitch.</i>

07:13.058 --> 07:16.926
<i>Now, most of the boys that ran
with me during that little war</i>

07:16.937 --> 07:19.395
<i>are dead or gone or hiding.</i>

07:20.106 --> 07:22.473
<i>But I never let
them push me out.</i>

07:22.484 --> 07:24.771
<i>New Mexico Territory
was my home.</i>

07:24.778 --> 07:26.360
Well...

07:27.197 --> 07:28.687
Shall we give him
a proper burial?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.780
Yeah, Why not?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.402
<i>And I was making one hell
of a name for myself.</i>

08:01.356 --> 08:02.938
Um, Friday?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.897
Good. Very good, Pietro.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.896
Okay, so we have Friday.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.655
Family.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.074
Fulminate.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.612
What else?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.959
Over there.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.643
- A watch?
- Watch. Very good.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.518
Uh...

08:45.984 --> 08:47.270
Wobbly!

08:47.902 --> 08:49.358
Whoa!

08:50.822 --> 08:52.278
Don't move.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.167
Hey, Dave, put your
lips around that.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.154
<i>How you doin', Beaver?</i>

09:42.165 --> 09:43.496
What happened to you?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.132
<i>Padre.</i>

09:55.929 --> 10:00.173
Militia's been through. And the cavalry.
And they keep on comin'.

10:00.183 --> 10:03.266
When you was in Guadalupe, they
sent in a new governor to clean up.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.510
He's going through the
territory like the pox,

10:05.522 --> 10:08.105
runnin' in everybody who fired
a shot in the Lincoln War,

10:08.108 --> 10:10.725
draggin' them all back across
the whole damn country.

10:10.735 --> 10:14.023
This says General Lew Wallace has
proclaimed a state of insurrection.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.692
They're fixin' to do
a big exterminatin'.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.862
And, Kid, you're on the top
of their hanging list.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.403
They want to put you down.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.373
Are you Billy the Kid?

10:30.588 --> 10:33.080
No, but I am Arkansas
Dave Rudabaugh.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.873
You ever hear of me?

10:36.719 --> 10:40.087
I killed 65 men, not counting
Mexicans and Indians.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.348
You must have heard of me.
Come on. Rudabaugh!

10:46.855 --> 10:48.016
Great.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.937
I'd like some <i>frijoles,</i>
and some coffee.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.106
Please.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.196
Get out of here, boy! If I have to
tell you one more goddamn time,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.819
- I'll put an iron to you!
<i>- Quien</i> es?

11:03.830 --> 11:07.073
Goddamn vagrant. Came out
in the orphan train.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.074
- Eatin' out of my ashcans.
- Come over here.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.372
<i>Steam bread from my ovens.</i>

11:12.922 --> 11:15.835
- You know who I am?
- Yes.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.008
"Yes"?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.337
Where are you from? New York?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.048
Pennsylvania.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.935
What you got in that satchel?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.770
Eastern tenderfoot
son of a bitch.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.093
Beever, leave him alone.
Shut up.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.566
So, what do you want?

11:35.069 --> 11:38.653
You want to just look at me?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.442
Uh, go on. Have a look.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.786
I want to ride the
trail with the Kid...

11:48.958 --> 11:50.494
Billy the Kid.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.292
Prince of Piss...

11:54.255 --> 11:56.041
Prince of Pistoleers.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.960
Hey, Beever!

11:57.967 --> 12:00.880
Hey, Beever, did you hear that?
Prince of Pistoleers.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.218
I haven't heard that one before.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.138
You want to ride with
Billy the Kid? Hmm?

12:10.104 --> 12:14.143
Is that what you want? You want
lead shot in your leg like this?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.311
Huh?

12:15.944 --> 12:17.355
How about in your skull?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.482
Hiding out in the damn brush
like some kind of lizard.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.927
Everybody in the territory trying to
take a shot at you. Boom, boom, boom!

12:22.951 --> 12:25.238
Is that what you want,
Mr. Pennsylvania, huh?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.360
Huh? Is that what you want?

12:32.669 --> 12:33.784
Yes.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.500
"Yes"?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.341
Beever, puff with him.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.550
I got you, you little vagrant!

12:49.560 --> 12:51.096
- Get out!
- Let go!

12:51.896 --> 12:54.604
And stay the hell out!

12:58.403 --> 13:00.690
<i>Soldados! Ándale, ándale</i>

13:03.283 --> 13:05.490
What do you keep
botherin' me for?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.951
Can't you see I run a
respectable place?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.661
Go on. Bother somebody
else, will you?

13:09.664 --> 13:11.371
Shut up, Beever.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.289
<i>Gringo, vente pa 'a ca.</i>

13:17.922 --> 13:21.460
What's the matter? You don't...
You only like boys?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.630
<i>Putos.</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:32.805
Hey, you bringing someone in?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.018
They got one!

13:43.323 --> 13:45.655
Doc Scurlock. Open her up.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.666
- What you doing, boy?
- Yeah!

14:01.507 --> 14:03.669
Nice to see you again, Doc.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.295
Got a few of your friends
waitin' for you.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.840
Scurlock.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.137
I know you.

14:13.144 --> 14:18.014
You've been delivered into my hands,
you stinking Presbyterian filth!

14:27.158 --> 14:30.367
Chavez. Good to see you.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.705
"When troubles come, they
come not single spies,"

14:35.083 --> 14:36.869
"but in battalions."

14:37.710 --> 14:38.825
Josiah G. Scurlock.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.920
I never wrote that. I
always wanted to tell you.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.756
William Shakespeare wrote it.
You look good.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.327
What about a drink, Doc?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.097
Where did they catch you?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.682
Seven rail days east.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.180
Wife?

14:56.187 --> 14:57.552
Child.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.638
Chavez.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.232
Where the hell is he?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.404
Billy.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.864
Whoa, whoa.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.576
Heavy steps, Patsy.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.077
Hey, <i>gracias.</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:22.540
A messenger came through town
today from the new governor.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.830
He wants to meet with you.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.217
He can't catch ya. You're
making him look a fool.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.426
Go on.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.882
He wants to talk treaty.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.095
You're boshin' me.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.966
He wants you to turn state's
evidence and testify.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.389
Testify against who?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.895
Against the Murphy boys he's
got in that pit in Lincoln.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.060
You can hang your
old enemies, Kid.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.934
It's the only chance you
got to save your neck.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.023
You got no place left to hide.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.950
So everybody's lookin' for me.
Hmm.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.785
Hey, Paulita Maxwell around?
She lookin' for me?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.282
It's gettin' kinda
lonely in here.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.581
No, I don't think Paulita
Maxwell is looking for you.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.171
I think Celsa Baca's
lookin' for you.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.256
Whoa, Celsa Baca!

16:08.259 --> 16:10.751
You'd have to bear-grease the damn
walls to get that pig in here.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.423
Yeah, that's the only thing
we'd have to bear-grease.

16:14.849 --> 16:19.309
<i>Well, Garrett was right. I was
running out of places to hide.</i>

16:19.812 --> 16:22.144
<i>And here was Governor
Lew Wallace,</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:24.810
<i>the second best-known
man in New Mexico,</i>

16:24.817 --> 16:27.479
<i>proposin' to make a treaty
with me in Lincoln.</i>

16:27.487 --> 16:30.275
<i>Then why give up the sanctuary
of a little village</i>

16:30.281 --> 16:32.147
<i>where I was protected
by my friends?</i>

16:38.372 --> 16:40.079
I found him! He's...

16:41.167 --> 16:43.329
<i>Well, I'll tell you Why.</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.577
<i>'Cause $500 cuts
a lot of ties...</i>

16:45.588 --> 16:48.046
Ah, damn it, Ignio.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.141
Move it! All right.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.493
Keep it down!

17:34.303 --> 17:35.793
Ride, Little Casino.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.921
<i>Rum Whom.!</i>

17:44.647 --> 17:45.933
Go, Billy!

17:48.859 --> 17:52.568
Your Excellency, it's him.
He's here.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.812
Well, show him in.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.165
Hi.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.710
Mr. Bonney?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.585
I appreciate your good faith.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.045
Who are you?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.051
Oh, I'm Governor Lew Wallace.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.097
Extraordinary.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.719
I was expecting a rather
rough and older fellow.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.812
Not so smooth of face.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.055
Cognac, Mr. Bonney?

18:29.066 --> 18:30.397
Uh-uh.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.812
Well, then, to the point.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.944
The various crimes committed
during the Lincoln Cattle War...

18:34.947 --> 18:38.156
Excuse me, sir, it
was no cattle war.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.651
It was a merchant war.
Irish against the English.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.822
They killed my employer,
Mr. Tunstall, and I made war.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.575
Those men that killed
your employer,

18:48.586 --> 18:52.204
the group that evaded the revenge
of your so-called Regulators,

18:52.923 --> 18:56.416
they've become a rather rough
bunch since this merchants' war,

18:56.427 --> 18:59.340
cutting prominent ranchers'
herds, like John Chisum's.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.633
Yes, sir, they have.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.006
And you have, too.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.759
However...

19:08.648 --> 19:12.186
you're one, and the
Murphy-Dolan rustlers are many.

19:12.193 --> 19:16.027
If you can testify against what
you saw in your little war,

19:16.656 --> 19:18.988
I can then eliminate the many.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.906
Well, what about the one?

19:25.373 --> 19:26.784
My terms are simple.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.375
Your testimony against those
who murdered your employer

19:30.378 --> 19:32.665
in exchange for leniency.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.787
No.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.629
My testimony in exchange
for a full pardon.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.419
Well, I'm afraid that's...

19:41.681 --> 19:45.174
I testify, and I ride out
of Lincoln a free man.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.343
If not, I ride out
of Lincoln now.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.519
Any of your boys try to follow
me, they wind up in a pine box.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.699
If you were given pardon,
you would leave New Mexico

20:11.711 --> 20:12.997
never to return.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.875
You go on the stand and
help me hang 15 rustlers

20:21.887 --> 20:23.719
and I'll give you pardon.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.680
Of course, 15 minutes later,

20:30.688 --> 20:33.646
the Murphy boys will shoot you
dead as a mangy dog in the street.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.228
So we'll arrest you.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.445
A staged arrest, for your own
protection before the trial.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.030
But that's for you to decide.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.160
Can I have some of that cake?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.409
Pendleton.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.744
Ah, ah, Pendleton.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.584
Uh-uh.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.090
The, uh, white cake,

21:02.511 --> 21:04.172
with the sweet frost.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.984
So, shall we proclaim our
secret parlay a success?

21:23.866 --> 21:25.277
It's a deal.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.456
When the neck is broken there's
only a sharp pain. Fast.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.997
Then, if the other place accepts
you, the Spirit Horse comes.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.336
It takes you there
to the other side.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.169
So don't worry too much.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.629
When you die, you're gonna
see the Spirit Horse.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.378
She'll come for you, my friend.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.221
Great. Let me tell you
something, Chavez.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.011
I don't really want to
catch a Spirit Horse.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.804
I don't even want
see the other side.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.021
I sure as hell don't want to have my
neck broke with a sharp, quick pain.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.436
The only thing I really wanna
do is get the hell out of here.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.689
Me, too.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.881
Well done, William.
Splendid performance.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.051
However, there are three candles
left, and only two bullets.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.474
Splendid! Splendid!

22:33.477 --> 22:35.388
What did I say?
Didn't I tell you?

22:36.689 --> 22:40.398
Mr. Bonney, District Attorney
Rynerson is here to see you.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.853
The Governor thinks it's best
if you have your restraints on.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.938
Hey, Sheriff?

22:48.075 --> 22:50.692
Can you bring that fiddle player in again?
He was quite good.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.070
How 'bout some more of that
cake, when you get a chance?

22:53.080 --> 22:56.163
And it's getting a little nippy in here.
Could you stoke up that fire?

22:56.166 --> 22:57.497
Thanks, George.

22:59.253 --> 23:02.837
<i>Yes, sir. I was starting to
grow fond of prison life.</i>

23:05.926 --> 23:09.294
Top of the morning to you, Mr. Bonney.
Finally in chains, are you?

23:09.763 --> 23:11.925
Still trying to
keep up your game?

23:13.350 --> 23:16.888
Well, we'll be seeing you on the
floor of the courts very soon.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.769
I ain't being tried.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.271
I'm testifying against Dolan
and all the other swine

23:21.275 --> 23:23.607
who killed my friend
John Tunstall, yessir.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.022
Are the bloody cocks
still running the coop?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.522
Ah, to be sure, that's right.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.246
Who gives testimony

23:37.750 --> 23:40.833
is strictly within the discretion
of the prosecuting attorney,

23:41.253 --> 23:42.664
who happens to be me,

23:43.339 --> 23:45.250
who happens to think

23:45.758 --> 23:49.092
not a bloody chance
in the pit of Hades.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.013
You can't bluff me.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.971
No, I'll charge you.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.392
Sentence you. I will hang you.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.356
But I'd never bluff you.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.351
See for yourself.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.289
The Governor's on his way
back to Santa Fe now.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.659
Pardon Billy the Kid?
Impossible.

24:16.413 --> 24:17.869
<i>I should've dusted
His Excellency's</i>

24:17.873 --> 24:19.910
<i>regal ass when I had the chance.</i>

24:21.043 --> 24:22.533
<i>He didn't exactly lie to me.</i>

24:23.796 --> 24:26.709
<i>He just didn't have the power
against the Irish politicians</i>

24:27.466 --> 24:28.986
<i>who were still running
Lincoln County.</i>

24:31.762 --> 24:33.218
Good day, Mr. Bonney.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.840
Good day, Mr. Dung Pile.

24:45.776 --> 24:49.235
<i>Another historical
and biological fact</i>

24:49.238 --> 24:52.981
<i>was that I had small
hands and big wrists.</i>

24:54.702 --> 24:59.447
<i>And that has saved my life more times
than Colonel Colt's equalizer.</i>

24:59.957 --> 25:02.289
Looks like it's getting
near to suppertime.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.207
You boys hungry?

25:05.546 --> 25:09.130
I got two lots of news
for you, good and bad.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.670
I'll give you the
bad news first.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.011
All we got for supper
is horse shit.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.464
What the hell's the good news?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.056
There's tons of it.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.973
The world hates a smart
mouth, Scurlock.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.598
You're gonna realize that tomorrow
when you swing from the gallows.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.414
That's if the lynch mob
don't come for you first,

25:43.417 --> 25:45.658
which I hear tell
they intend to do.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.249
Let me know if you boys
want some dessert.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.382
Howdy, Bell. Good evening.
Howdy, boys.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.850
If they stick their
fingers up again,

26:10.861 --> 26:13.694
I'll blow 'em off like I
did yours, hey, Murphy?

26:19.036 --> 26:24.076
<i>If there was one thing an outlaw
feared in the New Mexico Territory,</i>

26:24.083 --> 26:25.665
<i>it was lynch-mob justice.</i>

26:26.043 --> 26:27.408
Right on time.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.544
<i>With no patience for
courts and trials,</i>

26:30.964 --> 26:32.750
<i>they did it their own way.</i>

26:32.758 --> 26:35.466
<i>And there was no stoppin'</i> 'em.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.631
<i>Mainly because the
so-called law...</i>

26:37.638 --> 26:38.753
Howdy.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.801
<i>Had no damn intentions
of stopping them.</i>

26:40.808 --> 26:41.923
You're a bit late.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.345
Vigilantes!

26:43.352 --> 26:45.434
Jesus, it's a lynch mob!

26:45.437 --> 26:48.600
The Kid's escaped.
Little weasel.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.314
Oh, I'm sure he did, mister.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.773
See for yourself.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.777
Open the pit.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.196
No Billy the Kid in there.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.078
It's true. He's gone.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.000
We might as well go.

27:10.003 --> 27:14.338
We got some of his Regulators in
there, an Indian and a tenderfoot.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.798
Rode with the Kid on the
Tunstall-McSween side.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.877
How'd they be?

27:19.888 --> 27:22.004
Ah, shit. They'll have to do.
Bring 'em up.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.769
Pick your tree, breed.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.565
Stop! I order you as a peace
officer of Lincoln County.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.573
Gentlemen, I'm a schoolteacher
from the city of New York.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.114
And the breed back there,
well, he's my guide.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.488
And I believe you're about
to make an enormous error.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.240
We know you rode with the boy-devil
and you're gonna hang for it.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.625
I swear to you, I never
even laid eyes on him.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.744
I was a schoolteacher from
the city of New York.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.359
"I'm a school teacher from
the city of New York."

27:58.051 --> 28:00.463
Howdy, Doc. How
are your drawers?

28:02.055 --> 28:04.012
Nice to see you again, Billy.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.381
It's the Kid!

28:05.392 --> 28:06.848
Come on, let's get out.

28:07.352 --> 28:11.266
Jesus. You sure got a lot of
boys riding with you these days.

28:11.273 --> 28:12.354
Them ain't my boys.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.100
It's a real lynch mob!
Get out! Ha! Ha!

28:21.533 --> 28:23.900
Ha! Ha! Ha!

28:40.844 --> 28:43.302
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.585
They went over that way!

29:42.906 --> 29:44.237
I think we got him.

30:13.103 --> 30:16.221
We've got to get out of here!
Come on!

30:31.246 --> 30:32.327
Hold still, now.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.910
Got this buckshot
infection in my elbow.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.208
Makes my right arm kind of...
Whoa!

30:39.212 --> 30:40.498
Hold still, now.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.672
I am still. Just shoot
the chain, okay?

30:45.635 --> 30:47.251
God damn. It's good
to see you, Doc.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.639
I knew you'd come back.
We made a pact, remember?

30:52.267 --> 30:55.760
You, me, and Chavez.
Pals, forever.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.307
Billy, the chain. Come on.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.180
Look, I don't care if you
guys swapped spittle

30:59.191 --> 31:00.602
and pissed in each
other's boots.

31:00.609 --> 31:03.317
I don't take to
tenderfoots in my gang.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.277
And I definitely don't
take to no Mexicans.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.112
It ain't your gang, Dave.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.398
Mexican-Indian, you
son of a bitch.

31:09.826 --> 31:13.535
I'm sorry. Tell me
something, Chavez.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.951
Was it the savages putting
it to a Mexican whore

31:16.958 --> 31:19.996
or was it an Indian whore putting it
to the whole goddamn Mexican army?

31:20.003 --> 31:21.843
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on!

31:22.506 --> 31:24.247
God damn it.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.214
You remember something, Dave.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.301
These boys are the Lincoln
County Regulators.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.712
Yeah, <i>was.</i>

31:31.723 --> 31:34.260
Were. Billy, come on, the chain.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.722
You're right, Doc. Were.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.847
There ain't no
Regulators no more.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.807
No room for 'em.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.602
No room for me.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.069
Billy, please.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.320
I'm taking the
Mexican Blackbird.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.318
What are you taking?

31:54.329 --> 31:56.449
The broken trail that
goes down to Old Mexico.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.447
Only me and a few
other boys know it.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.167
Take the trail below. And, Doc,

32:02.504 --> 32:05.292
once you're down there,
these basket men...

32:05.298 --> 32:08.086
Pay 'em, they'll come up and
they'll get your belongings,

32:08.093 --> 32:09.333
your family, whatever you need.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.793
Come here, Billy.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.883
Why don't you just
shoot the chain, okay?

32:14.975 --> 32:17.467
All right, listen here.
Mount up.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.937
We're taking the Mexican Blackbird, huh?
Old Mexico. Let's go.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.101
Come on.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.644
Where'd you find him?

32:35.662 --> 32:37.244
That was pretty good.

32:38.915 --> 32:39.996
That's for you.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.785
It's from New York.
It's for the horse.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.052
That horse ain't for sale, Doc.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.140
But, uh, how about my boots?
They're nice and broke and...

32:59.144 --> 33:00.600
Son of a bitch!

33:02.105 --> 33:04.972
Come on, Billy! Kill that
tenderfoot son of a bitch.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.441
Come on. Get on top of him.
Come on!

33:08.403 --> 33:10.064
Come on. Break it up, Billy.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.645
I know you, you son of a bitch!

33:11.656 --> 33:12.862
You know me, huh?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.941
Well, I know you, Scurlock!

33:14.951 --> 33:16.551
You killed half the
men I got credit for.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.196
I saw you with blood all over yourself.
I saw you kill.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.616
Just because you went back East and
married, and put on a silk cravat,

33:24.002 --> 33:26.722
- that doesn't change what you did!
- Damn it, Chavez, let me at him!

33:27.255 --> 33:28.416
You remember John Tunstall?

33:31.718 --> 33:34.678
Remember the stories he'd tell us about
the three Chinamen playing fan tan?

33:35.597 --> 33:39.135
Someone runs up to them and says,
"Hey, the world is coming to an end."

33:39.142 --> 33:41.975
And the first one says, "Well, I
best go to the mission and pray."

33:42.604 --> 33:44.436
And the second one
says, "Well, hell,"

33:44.439 --> 33:46.771
"I'm gonna go buy me a case
of mescal and six whores."

33:47.275 --> 33:50.939
And the third one says, "Well,
I shall finish the game."

33:52.405 --> 33:54.396
I shall finish the game, Doc.

33:55.492 --> 33:58.405
Whosoever's going for Old
Mexico, we ride now.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.993
This ain't the untamed prairie
you used to run free over.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.831
I got a family I
gotta get back to...

34:04.834 --> 34:06.495
The new governor was
a general at Shiloh.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.460
He's got militia, he's got army.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.170
He's got money to pay glory
hunters to run you day and night.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.047
And they're on their way.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.295
And they will kill you, Doc.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.168
You take care of yourself, Pat.

34:18.764 --> 34:22.759
They'll catch you, Doc, and they'll
catch me. Everybody but him.

34:23.353 --> 34:24.764
The villagers say he's <i>diablero.</i>

34:24.771 --> 34:28.435
He can change into a coyote,
disappear, and never gets killed.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.726
I just think he's the luckiest
white eye in New Mexico.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.568
I think he'll cross the border.
He will.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.442
Chavez, I can't ride
with him anymore.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.908
Trying to spend the last
year forgetting about him.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.327
I read about him in the newspaper
and them damn 5-cent books.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.245
Jesus Christ, the
children of New York City

34:48.253 --> 34:49.664
imitate him in the streets.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.703
He's in my sleep.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.002
You gotta understand what I'm sayin'.
It's over.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.967
When the Spirit Horse
comes, then it's over.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.143
<i>Well, Chavez knew what
he was talking about.</i>

35:06.521 --> 35:10.014
<i>He'd seen the soldiers
murder his entire family.</i>

35:10.358 --> 35:14.568
<i>And he'd been hunted down like
a dog and thrown in the pit.</i>

35:14.988 --> 35:19.027
<i>He knew his only chance was
to skin out and head south.</i>

35:22.912 --> 35:26.871
<i>But Doc, he did have something
else to go back to.</i>

35:27.500 --> 35:30.037
<i>And although him and
me were like brothers</i>

35:30.045 --> 35:32.503
<i>and he really wanted
to ride with me,</i>

35:32.505 --> 35:34.837
<i>he just needed some
time to think about it.</i>

35:34.841 --> 35:36.423
Oh, no.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.866
Where's the hammer?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.829
Give us a hand.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.789
That's it. Got it?

36:19.052 --> 36:22.511
We want his head. You understand
that, Sheriff Kimbel?

36:23.348 --> 36:25.589
I want you to get on your horse

36:25.600 --> 36:28.183
and I want you to track this little
fiend to the edge of the Earth.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.676
I want you to assassinate him.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.396
I want you to deliver
his head in burlap.

36:34.150 --> 36:38.269
I'd rather drink turpentine
and piss on a brush fire.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.649
I ain't touching this one.

36:47.414 --> 36:50.247
Billy, where are the
men you promised us?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.782
You said you had an army.

36:52.794 --> 36:53.875
I do.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.999
Here it comes.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.127
Jesus.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.381
Just one? And that's
all you could find?

37:07.392 --> 37:08.928
No one want to come.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.142
Everyone afraid.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.597
- Are you a farmer?
- Yes, sir.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.770
My name is Hendry
William French.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.940
You ever shoot anybody before,
Hendry William French?

37:23.533 --> 37:25.274
You ever shoot anything before?

37:26.369 --> 37:27.859
Sage hen.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.908
Sage hen.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.332
Well, tell me something, Hendry,

37:34.335 --> 37:36.417
why is it that you want
to join my gang, huh?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.541
Well, I ain't...

37:39.966 --> 37:41.752
I ain't a farmer no more.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.134
Uh, lost my wife to the pox.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.762
Lost my land to the money men.

37:47.766 --> 37:51.555
Hey, Big Casino, why don't you
saw a foot off this thing

37:51.561 --> 37:54.394
in case we run into Governor
Wallace on the way.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.394
I don't think I'm gonna
make this one, Kid.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.489
What do you mean?

38:11.414 --> 38:12.745
You gotta come with us, Pat.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.741
<i>What are you gonna do, stay
here and scrub pots for Beaver?</i>

38:15.752 --> 38:18.039
I may have old Beever
scrub the pots for me.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.670
I'm buyin' this place, turning
it into an eatin' house.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.255
There's wildcat money
comin' in here.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.671
I gotta stake my piece while I
still got a fair enough name.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.260
What name?

38:27.597 --> 38:29.679
You'd be ridin' with
known men, Patsy.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.515
You always wanted to be a
known man in New Mexico.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.260
Hell, I'll be a known man. Next
time you ride through here,

38:35.271 --> 38:38.764
there'll be a big old sign out
there that says "Garrett's Place."

38:40.443 --> 38:42.775
It's time I got an income that
ain't from stealin' horses.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.521
You remember somethin', Pat.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.069
I never stole a horse from
someone I didn't like.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.942
If I didn't like them, I just
wouldn't even bother with 'em.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.034
Nah, he'd just kill 'em.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.449
Hey, come on, Pat.
You're one of us.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.543
You've always been one of us!

39:02.215 --> 39:04.126
I always will be, Billy.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.639
Well, go on, then! Go on!
We don't need you, Pat.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.053
We don't need him.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.734
Soapweed, I got you!

39:28.741 --> 39:32.575
You want to eat out of my ashcans?
Go on. Have a chew.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.873
Howdy, Beever.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.881
Go on, sit with the boys.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.466
What the hell's this?

39:49.012 --> 39:50.173
This?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.846
This is the Prince
of Pennsylvania.

40:13.077 --> 40:17.071
<i>The first stop along the Blackbird
was to raise some dineros.</i>

40:17.624 --> 40:21.709
<i>And John Simpson Chisum was the
richest man in the territory.</i>

40:22.962 --> 40:27.581
<i>Not only that, but as anyone
familiar with the Lincoln War knows,</i>

40:27.592 --> 40:31.130
<i>he was a financial partner
of Tunstall and McSween,</i>

40:31.137 --> 40:33.003
<i>which made him an ally.</i>

40:39.312 --> 40:44.227
<i>Old John admired my pluck and
loved me like I was his own son.</i>

40:44.233 --> 40:45.564
Well, by God.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.685
You've really turned out
to be a snake, Billy.

40:49.405 --> 40:52.318
When they catch you, they're gonna
dry-gulch your stinkin' bones.

40:52.909 --> 40:56.573
I'm just tryin' to get my friends
to Old Mexico. We need some pesos.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.069
Now, I've done some figurin'

40:58.081 --> 41:00.163
and I figure that you
owe us, Mr. Chisum.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.410
$250 for the fightin'
we did last year

41:04.420 --> 41:06.878
and $250 for me leaving
your stock alone.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.212
Is that what you figured?

41:08.591 --> 41:09.922
Yes, sir. That's what I figured.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.258
Well, you can take those figures

41:12.261 --> 41:14.468
and shove 'em up your
arrogant little ass

41:14.472 --> 41:17.681
and set fire to 'em. I don't
owe you a goddamn thing.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.970
Now get the hell out of here!

41:19.978 --> 41:22.640
I'll bring my 50 down and
give you a real game.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.435
Yeah, we, uh... We saw some of your
men up there on the high range.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.226
Passed right by them.
Fine bunch.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.737
Mr. Chisum,

41:33.324 --> 41:35.691
you're right. The Lincoln
County War is over.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.774
We just want to get out of here.

41:37.954 --> 41:38.954
Get down below.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.781
Oh, you'll get down
below all right, Doc.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.157
You'll get down below.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.335
You're Billy the
Kid, too, you know.

41:48.464 --> 41:51.547
You all are dirty,
little Billy bastards.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.674
And I don't owe you anything,
Doc, or you, Chavez.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.968
You took my farm, Mr. Chisum.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.018
You took a lot of
farms, Mr. Chisum.

42:05.398 --> 42:09.392
As long as Billy the Kid is
taking some back, I'm with him.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.484
Everything all
right, Mr. Chisum?

42:12.822 --> 42:15.530
Yes. Yes, everything's fine.
Uh...

42:16.743 --> 42:19.485
Well, go on and bring
the men in, and, uh...

42:19.495 --> 42:21.736
We'll have a little fresh
coffee with the boys here.

42:22.248 --> 42:23.248
Yoo-hoo.

42:24.584 --> 42:25.619
I'll make you famous.

42:26.335 --> 42:29.248
Mr. Chisum, which one of these
boys is fastest with the iron?

42:29.255 --> 42:30.620
Don't you do it, Billy.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.039
That'll be me.

42:33.968 --> 42:36.710
- You, drop Sam Colt.
- Billy.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.429
Put her down, now.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.757
Step away.

42:49.942 --> 42:52.309
You owe me $500, Mr. Chisum.

42:52.695 --> 42:53.981
So what I'm gonna do

42:54.530 --> 42:56.897
is kill one of your men
for every $5 you owe me.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.441
Only, I'm gonna do it fair.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.120
How's that for square?

43:14.550 --> 43:17.417
Now, when I go for my
gun, you start shootin'.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.883
But I promise you, you
will not make it.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.384
Ready?

43:26.813 --> 43:28.303
Yeah, I'm ready.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.356
Dave.

43:36.239 --> 43:38.196
Oh, my God.

43:38.491 --> 43:39.606
$495.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.241
Hendry.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.249
Oh, my God.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.251
Hendry.

43:49.794 --> 43:50.794
Oh, my...

43:56.676 --> 43:58.041
$490.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.463
You just killed yourself.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.595
Bonney, you are a fool!

44:06.602 --> 44:09.435
You call yourself the
scourge of New Mexico?

44:09.856 --> 44:13.565
Well, by God, I am New Mexico.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.271
And you are dead.

44:19.365 --> 44:22.528
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. New Mexico.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.993
I wouldn't give a bucket
of piss for your future.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.245
Skin out, boys.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.152
You have yourself
a good day, now.

44:39.385 --> 44:40.716
I want him dead.

44:40.720 --> 44:44.463
Well, the problem is he's protected
by all the surrounding communities.

44:44.473 --> 44:47.511
They've made a bloody hero out of
a half-wit common horse thief.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.974
That's what I say!

44:51.063 --> 44:53.805
Let's hire a thief to catch one.

44:55.568 --> 44:58.401
Bring him in, Governor,
and make the offer.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.696
Pendleton.

45:27.391 --> 45:29.723
If I've been brought
here to be, uh,

45:29.727 --> 45:33.015
implicated in anything, I just want
you to know that I'm a family man,

45:33.022 --> 45:35.434
fixing to settle and
run a business.

45:35.441 --> 45:39.435
Mr. Chisum has informed us of
your ambitions, Mr. Garrett.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.982
Now, Pat, we know that you've
been with Billy Bonney

45:42.782 --> 45:44.568
several times when
he cut my herd.

45:45.034 --> 45:49.028
Now, Pat, we're looking for somebody who
knows his haunts, his, uh, hideouts.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.571
Somebody who is familiar
with his patterns.

45:51.582 --> 45:54.199
You are familiar with
him, Mr. Garrett?

45:56.212 --> 45:57.498
You see, Patrick,

45:58.130 --> 46:00.417
certain changes need
to be structured.

46:01.217 --> 46:05.552
We need a sheriff who can eliminate
this particular problem.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.634
I don't quite follow
what you're sayin'.

46:09.642 --> 46:12.509
We're sayin', "Sheriff
of Lincoln County."

46:13.646 --> 46:15.182
Sheriff Pat Garrett.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.185
Now, that ought to make
you feel pretty good.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.648
And we're saying $500.

46:22.655 --> 46:23.986
Up front.

46:25.658 --> 46:27.444
And $500 after.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.567
$1,000, Mr. Garrett.

46:29.996 --> 46:34.991
And all the resources you need
to carry out the extermination

46:35.001 --> 46:38.414
of one William H. Bonney.

46:38.421 --> 46:40.458
Is that satisfactory?

46:49.098 --> 46:53.262
<i>While Pat was thinking about the
Santa Fe ring's generous offer,</i>

46:53.269 --> 46:56.261
<i>me and the boys were busy
sorting out our finances.</i>

46:56.272 --> 46:59.685
<i>We figured that if it was
too much of a hardship</i>

46:59.692 --> 47:01.774
- <i>for Chisum to give us any money...</i>
- Howdy.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.064
<i>Well, then we'd help him out</i>

47:04.071 --> 47:06.153
<i>- and just take a few of his cows.</i>
- Bought some cows.

47:06.157 --> 47:09.946
I guess what I'm trying to
say is, you're called Kid

47:10.619 --> 47:13.657
and, uh, Rudabaugh's
called Arkansas Dave.

47:13.664 --> 47:17.282
And, uh, I dare say Doc's
Christian name ain't Doc.

47:17.293 --> 47:18.624
You want a name?

47:18.627 --> 47:23.042
Yes, sir. I would like that. I
would like that very much indeed.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.294
You have to earn it, Hendry.

47:26.302 --> 47:29.840
Until then, you're stuck with
plain old Hendry. Sorry.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.769
Still trying to get this
ragsheet off the ground, Ash?

48:19.772 --> 48:22.184
The copy is good,
the machine is bad.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.726
I hear you're gonna be opening
up an eatin' house, Garrett.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.818
Would you like to secure
an advertisement?

48:27.822 --> 48:29.358
I've changed my mind.

48:31.700 --> 48:33.190
Jesus Christ.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.239
You're the one that the
Santa Fe ring hired...

48:36.247 --> 48:37.408
Never mind that.

48:37.706 --> 48:38.946
I want to hire you for a job.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.452
You do?

48:41.210 --> 48:44.123
I want you to document the hunt for
the most famous man in New Mexico.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.245
I want a book written on it,

48:47.800 --> 48:49.720
so that the people will
understand the situation.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.468
I want you to ride along with me

48:52.471 --> 48:54.382
and record the dangers
of the expedition.

48:54.390 --> 48:57.382
Ride along with you? On a horse?

48:57.643 --> 48:59.475
Oh...

49:00.062 --> 49:03.896
This I can't do. I came out
West to save my last lung.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.398
I'm a journalist.

49:06.402 --> 49:08.018
You're a broke journalist.

49:10.322 --> 49:12.154
And you're a drunk.

49:18.998 --> 49:23.287
The country was overgrown
with weed and brush

49:23.294 --> 49:25.752
and encumbered with loose rock,

49:26.255 --> 49:28.166
making it almost impassable.

49:29.258 --> 49:30.669
I like that. That's very good.

49:36.015 --> 49:37.756
Good morning, Sheriff.

49:37.766 --> 49:41.930
We met at the Governor's. John W.
Poe, Cattlemen's Association.

49:42.188 --> 49:44.475
The Governor sent me and these
men to lend you a hand.

49:45.608 --> 49:48.270
Encumbered by idiots,
we pressed on.

49:49.528 --> 49:52.361
I like that. It's very good.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.535
What did they do now?
Spell your name wrong?

50:06.545 --> 50:09.879
Got a new sheriff on us, boys.
Goes by the name of Pat Garrett.

50:10.299 --> 50:13.837
Jesus Christ! What the
hell did he do that for?

50:14.887 --> 50:18.471
To make himself famous.
Be a known man like me.

50:18.474 --> 50:20.340
What about me? What'd
they say about me, huh?

50:20.351 --> 50:21.762
Nothing, Dave.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.560
Just playing the game, Doc.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.021
We'll give him a
game, all right.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.890
All right, Dave's
boys, we ride now.

50:28.901 --> 50:30.517
We are gonna give Pat
Garrett the ride

50:30.528 --> 50:32.860
of his miserable
two-faced stinking life.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.570
Let's skin out, come on!

50:41.163 --> 50:42.574
Come on!

50:45.751 --> 50:46.957
Do you believe this?

50:47.545 --> 50:48.910
Hey, Tom.

50:49.547 --> 50:54.212
Last one out of here drinks
dirty dishwater. Come on!

50:54.927 --> 50:56.088
- Son of a bitch.
- Whoo!

51:20.035 --> 51:21.366
Halt.

51:24.039 --> 51:26.952
Burial ground. Warm
Springs People.

51:28.711 --> 51:29.917
Apache.

51:31.547 --> 51:33.163
We better get going.

51:33.716 --> 51:35.206
We'll go around.

51:35.718 --> 51:39.382
Chavez, why don't you go peck
shit with the chickens, huh?

51:39.388 --> 51:42.597
You know what they're payin' for
Apache bone in Silver City, right now?

51:42.600 --> 51:45.558
Christ Almighty, they're making...
They're making ashtrays,

51:45.561 --> 51:48.053
they're making combs, they're
making knife handles...

51:48.063 --> 51:50.475
You get 50 cents for a
good Indian leg bone.

51:50.482 --> 51:52.894
It's all out there, so don't
you go getting sentimental

51:52.901 --> 51:55.063
and all that, all right?
Come on.

51:56.905 --> 51:59.442
You go in there, smart gringo,
and I'll bury you there.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.818
- Okay.
- Let's go.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.076
Come on.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.588
Whoo! Silver City, here I come.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.391
Shit.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.306
Son of a...

53:20.698 --> 53:21.904
I don't think so, Dave.

53:31.166 --> 53:34.249
<i>That Mexican-Indian may
have lost his family,</i>

53:34.253 --> 53:36.494
<i>but he hadn't lost a
trick when it came down</i>

53:36.505 --> 53:38.917
<i>to an old-fashioned
pig-sticking match.</i>

53:38.924 --> 53:40.335
You want your knife back?

53:43.262 --> 53:44.548
Shit.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.841
Get up.

53:47.349 --> 53:51.843
<i>And, Dave, well, he appreciated
the value of fair play.</i>

53:52.396 --> 53:56.105
<i>But he also appreciated the value
of a good bone-handled knife.</i>

53:57.192 --> 54:00.776
<i>And we were going around that
cemetery, I promise you.</i>

54:00.779 --> 54:03.020
Thank you.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.633
Garrett!

54:33.061 --> 54:36.645
Get me off this animal! I
have to have a movement.

54:37.566 --> 54:39.056
You have to have a what?

54:39.067 --> 54:40.478
He has to have a shit.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.648
I have to have a
movement, please.

54:42.654 --> 54:44.065
That's the fourth one today.

54:46.658 --> 54:48.069
And, Sheriff, at the
risk of offending you,

54:48.076 --> 54:51.740
your newspaperman is hindering an
important government operation.

54:52.539 --> 54:55.827
I have to request that he
be discharged from service.

55:02.341 --> 55:03.752
What do you make of it?

55:03.759 --> 55:05.375
A tobacco pouch.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.589
It's his. I gave it to him.

55:09.431 --> 55:11.923
It's buffalo scrotum,
from my first kill.

55:11.934 --> 55:14.016
Big old bull near Fort Griffin.

55:16.021 --> 55:18.479
That's a pretty story, Sheriff.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.519
Why'd he leave it hangin'
there like that?

55:20.526 --> 55:22.392
Just to say hello.

55:24.613 --> 55:27.981
Looks like he's saying
more than hello.

55:45.425 --> 55:46.665
What's "scum"?

55:46.677 --> 55:48.088
Well, Tom, that's bad types.

55:48.679 --> 55:52.889
Politicians, bankers, cattle kings.
Scum.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.598
Come on.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.275
Come along, Mother.

56:18.709 --> 56:22.247
Oh, well, I'll be hog-tied
and sent to Hades! Billy!

56:22.254 --> 56:23.915
Oh!

56:23.922 --> 56:26.004
What have we got here?

56:26.008 --> 56:28.249
- How are you, Jane?
- Wicked boys.

56:28.260 --> 56:31.343
Four, five, six wicked boys.

56:32.055 --> 56:34.262
Wicked and wanted, or
just plain wicked?

56:34.808 --> 56:35.923
$1,000 are on me.

56:35.934 --> 56:37.845
Yeah? I heard $500.

56:37.853 --> 56:39.059
Well, you heard wrong, Jane.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.019
Well, I also heard that you
ain't long for the territory.

56:41.023 --> 56:43.014
We're not.

56:43.025 --> 56:45.062
We're going to Old Mexico.
Right, Billy?

56:45.068 --> 56:47.935
Well, good luck. How
old is this fellow?

56:47.946 --> 56:49.306
- Seventeen.
- Fourteen and a half.

56:51.366 --> 56:52.697
Fourteen and a half?

56:54.036 --> 56:55.743
Oh, well, don't
forget that half.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.620
There's a lot of experience
packed into that half.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.953
It's different.

57:02.878 --> 57:05.290
My hair? It's the new fashion.
You like it?

57:05.923 --> 57:07.755
Yeah, your hair, but...
But everything.

57:08.717 --> 57:11.425
This whole town. Outside, too.
They got a church.

57:12.471 --> 57:13.677
This ain't White Oaks.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.968
Yeah, well, there's 2,011
souls in this town, Kid.

57:16.975 --> 57:19.091
A lot of back East money.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.139
The town's different.
It's respectable.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.961
You're not telling us you've gone
respectable, Jane, have you?

57:25.025 --> 57:29.485
Well, to the eye that don't
know no better, yeah, I have.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.150
Well, I've heard enough.

57:32.157 --> 57:35.445
My boys here would like some boonda
upstairs right quick, darling.

57:35.953 --> 57:38.786
Did I hear you say you'd
like a "Excellent malt",

57:38.997 --> 57:42.160
"six times served, in a
room with a southern view"?

57:43.168 --> 57:45.626
You're a lady to the
manor born, Jane.

57:48.131 --> 57:49.917
To the manor born.

57:54.972 --> 57:56.883
He was hurt pretty good.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.966
Looks like the
muskrats are in a trap

57:59.977 --> 58:01.888
and chewing their own legs off.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.477
All right, we're going north.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.062
South, you mean.

58:05.065 --> 58:07.056
No, I mean north.

58:07.067 --> 58:11.026
But, Sheriff, the last time I
heard, Old Mexico is still south.

58:11.989 --> 58:14.151
You ever hear of a coydog, Poe?

58:14.157 --> 58:16.489
- Half common dog, half coyote.
- Yeah.

58:16.493 --> 58:19.360
You feed one, he keeps coming around.
No fear of man.

58:19.371 --> 58:20.577
The Kid's a coydog.

58:21.581 --> 58:24.164
We've come 150 miles
without a town.

58:24.501 --> 58:27.368
Right about now, he's
looking for some attention.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.163
Ash!

58:32.592 --> 58:34.424
He ain't my concern.

59:16.094 --> 59:18.711
Sheriff, I think I need
to have a movement.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.845
Me, too.

59:22.392 --> 59:23.928
”Over the Mountains Of the Moon

59:23.935 --> 59:25.551
"'Down the Valley of the Shadow"

59:25.562 --> 59:28.554
"'Ride, boldly ride'
The shade replied"

59:29.941 --> 59:31.898
"'If you seek for Eldorado!"

59:32.235 --> 59:33.600
Why, that was heavenly.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.479
Who wrote it?

59:36.490 --> 59:40.028
Josiah "Doc" Scurlock.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.909
Who the hell is that?

59:43.580 --> 59:45.162
You come back, now.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.140
Oh, no.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:16.022
Billy!

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.986
Look out the window, Billy!

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.285
Billy!

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.036
They don't tolerate scum.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.121
Help me gather the boys. Go
on, get everyone downstairs.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.456
Billy the Kid,

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.285
alias William H. Bonney.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.453
It's Deputy Carlyle. I
best go speak to him.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.380
And Dave Rudabaugh of Las Vegas!

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.625
He said Dave Rudabaugh
of Las Vegas!

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.092
I'm real happy for you, Dave.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:43.133
Black knights on the premises,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.222
turn your bodies over to the law

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:47.265
or perish in flame!

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.063
Carlyle, what the hell's
going on down here?

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:54.775
Billy the Kid,

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:57.817
we have Jane Greathouse
held out here.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.354
I'm coming in to talk to you.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.732
If anything happens to me,

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.484
the citizens here say
they will string her up

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.985
and burn her.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.621
Do you agree to those terms?

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.241
Do I agree to those terms?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.663
Who is this guy?

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.458
Uh... Yes, sir, we
agree to those terms.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.425
I'm goin' in.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:22.509
All right, boys, put your guns
away and look respectable.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.798
Ladies, upstairs.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.930
O'Folliard, disappear.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.481
Gentlemen.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:47.151
Uh, gentlemen, which of you
is the leader of your gang?

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.993
That would be me.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.456
Arkansas Dave.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.825
You are not, Dave.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:56.668
- I am so!
- You are not!

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.587
- I am so.
- Are not.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.331
- I am so.
- Gentlemen.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:04.210
I am a deputized man. I
do things the law way.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.135
Which way?

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.172
Law way.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:13.470
Law way. I see. Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.393
Now, the people out there,
they do things their own way.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.515
They got their minds
set on a hanging.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:21.894
It's gonna be hell if I can't
control this situation.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:25.322
So, what I propose is this.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.158
I understand you have an
Indian in your group.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.653
Yes, sir. Jose Chavez y Chavez.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.580
He's a Mexican-Indian.
How'd that be?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.832
Well, that'll be just fine.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:38.126
If I can give this Indian
to those people out there,

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.369
they'll be well satisfied.

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:42.543
And the rest of you
can just ride out.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:45.884
You hear that, Chavez?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.012
Sir, I agree to those terms.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.597
They are an angry mob, indeed.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.012
And we do happen to have
an Indian on the premises.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.352
Give me your hat.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.529
Now, Mr. Law Way,

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.740
may I see your hat?

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:16.915
I really don't see how hats are
relevant in this situation.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.079
I do.

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:22.423
Dave.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.713
The gentleman's jacket.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:34.810
There.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.385
Deputy Carlyle!

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.979
Now I can talk to you.

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:41.314
Now you don't look like
such a politician.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.397
Can I take the Indian
with me, or not?

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:47.442
The Indian's goin' out
to satisfy the crowd.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:50.362
But you obviously don't understand
the meaning of the word "pals."

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:54.278
You think I'd hand my friend over
to a bucket of mule dung like you?

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.204
That's an insult.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.077
Turn around, chief.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:04.834
Come on, Carlyle, are you
bringing him out or not?

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.627
All right, you white caps!

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:09.922
We're coming out, but we're
coming out shooting!

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.928
Get ready for war!

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:29.438
Uh-oh.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.941
Oh, my God. That's
Deputy Carlyle.

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.155
That's James Carlyle.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.286
Come on, let's go.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.781
They're leaving. They're
all skinning out.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:40.620
Pals.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.334
<i>Of course they
were skinning out.</i>

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.955
<i>They had just murdered
their own deputy.</i>

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:50.209
<i>They pinned that one on me, too,
but I never fired one shot.</i>

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.434
Just saying hello, Pat?

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.830
Did you entertain him?

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:30.920
Maybe.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.761
Did you like it?

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.264
Maybe.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:48.441
Remember the time you, me, and
him looked all the doors,

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:51.938
stayed up till the sun, breaking
the place up with six shooters?

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.609
Every bottle in the bar.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:57.196
Naked as jaybirds, and
there was no law.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.198
No law, and no barbed wire.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:05.201
Patrick, I'm going to
part with a nasty secret.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:08.499
You used to make me
hotter than a June bride

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.715
sitting bareback
on a depot stove.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.085
But I don't share my
bed with the law.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.726
And I don't keep
with whores no more.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.937
So ain't we both content.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.066
<i>Jane Steakhouse,</i>

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:41.411
the citizens of White Oaks have
proclaimed this place the devil's den.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:43.447
As Sheriff of Lincoln County,

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:46.621
I have to honor and protect
their civic virtues.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:53.294
I'll show them what my
civic virtues look like,

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:56.919
all those stall-fed tenderfeet,
with their shin plaster

01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:00.093
and their Sunday wives
in their Sunday dresses

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.306
with a preacher at the
back door by morning

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.055
to see if they got the
Connecticut blue laws

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.894
tattooed on their
lily-white buttocks!

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.739
Oh, Lord!

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:31.712
White Oaks, you can kiss my ass!

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:29.979
Hey.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.522
You got any water?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.850
Old timer, when did
this place boom up?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.607
Last week.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.274
Copper?

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.363
No.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.443
Guano. Bat droppings.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.488
Bat droppings?

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.947
I've been to gold
towns, silver towns.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.701
I've even been to turquoise towns.
But I've never to a bat-shit town.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.332
I can't wait to see the women.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.764
We got 'em.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:23.198
Come on! Go!

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:52.928
Whoa!

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.656
<i>Ash leeh! Ash leeh! Ash leeh!
Ash leeh!</i>

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.377
Phew!

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.568
Jesus Christ! Even their
horses are crazy.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.410
Hey!

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:19.598
It's all right. We got time. We'll
go back through the arroyo.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.720
Well, That's
convenient, ain't it?

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:26.404
- Pardon me?
- The Kid'll be long gone.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.115
Maybe that's what you want, Pat.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:32.281
What I want is for you to cork your
goddamn government mouth, mister.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.370
And the next time you
address me common,

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.247
I will put you on your
prissy little ass.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.791
Sweet Mary's ass. How the hell
did you get him to do that, huh?

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.422
What's that mean, anyway,
<i>"ash leeh, ash leeh"?</i>

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.546
It's an ancient Navajo word.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.132
It means "stop."

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:53.099
Stop.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.812
When we get to the
top of this bluff,

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.478
we'll have a clear view
of the Naschitti River.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.813
We'll sell the horses off,

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.153
then we'll take a skiff
downriver into Mexico.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.823
Hey, Tommy, last one up the
hill's a three-legged dog!

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.590
Billy.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:29.255
Is this Old Mexico?

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:30.262
No.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:34.474
It's Garrett.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.599
Skin out, Tom!

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:44.357
I got him.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.286
My God!

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.457
You shot me.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.131
You really shot me.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.601
Take your medicine, son.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.319
Well, it's a start.

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:32.294
I spent a lot of nights in this
cabin after the Lincoln War.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.883
Tried to put another
outfit together

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:38.550
but it never was the same.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.965
When you boys came back,

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:44.561
I felt like there was nothing I
wouldn't do to keep a gang together.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:46.179
Keep ridin'.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.105
What are you saying?

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.769
You know what the
Mexican Blackbird is?

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.238
It's a broken trail that
leads to Old Mexico.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:03.242
It's a half-black,
half-Mexican whore

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:04.785
up in Puerto de Luna.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:09.077
So you mean you named the
trail after her, right?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:19.588
There is no trail, is there, Billy?
Is there?

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.134
What about Old Mexico
you promised us?

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.929
I'd be just another
gringo in Old Mexico.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:30.394
It's the same as being dead.

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:31.687
What about Tommy?

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.812
You son of a bitch!

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.615
You're starting to believe what they're
writing about you, aren't you?

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.617
Let me tell you what
you really are.

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:45.367
You rode a 15-year-old boy
straight into his grave

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:48.287
and the rest of us
straight to hell.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:51.707
Straight to hell.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.000
William H. Bonney,

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:58.001
you are not a god.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.562
Why don't you pull the
trigger and find out?

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.025
I got to get back home.

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:35.880
What the hell are you doing?
We aren't in position yet.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:37.214
They killed him.

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:41.003
That bastard killed you. Get up, Doc.
Come on, get up.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.344
You leave him alone!

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:43.428
He's a dead man!

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.339
They're starting to surround us.
We gotta skin out of here.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.849
We gotta make a break!

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.101
Don't look at this. Look up.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.769
So who's going to
bust out first?

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.689
Well, Hendry William French,
you never killed nobody.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.940
They ain't gonna shoot at you.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.784
Go to hell. They shot Tommy!

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.448
Somebody's gotta do it.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.712
Jesus, there must be at
least 10 of 'em out there.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:18.080
Get me up.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:22.554
Dave,

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.971
- it's your gang.
- What?

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.470
It's your gang. You lead us out.
Come on!

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:31.185
It ain't my gang, it's your gang.
It's always been your gang.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.392
Don't cross me, Dave.

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:34.566
Billy!

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.566
Let's finish the game.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.225
Come on, Chavez! Go!

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:28.784
What the hell did
you do that for?

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:40.331
Pat, you son of a bitch!

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.961
You killed a boy!

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.680
And you killed Doc!
You knew him!

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.226
Chavez is back there!

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.722
Hendry, you gotta forget about him.
He's buzzard meat.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:59.224
Come on, they all are. It's
just you and me, farm boy.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:00.555
We've got to head
for the border.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:03.482
Shit.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:46.020
<i>It is therefore considered
by the court here</i>

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:49.691
<i>that said defendant William H.
Bonney, alias Kid,</i>

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:53.403
<i>alias William Antrim,
alias Henry McCarty,</i>

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:57.123
<i>be confined in prison
in said Lincoln County</i>

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.288
<i>by the Sheriff of such county</i>

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:03.960
<i>until on the day aforesaid
he be taken from such prison</i>

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:08.756
<i>to a suitable and convenient place
of execution within said county</i>

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:13.381
and there be hanged by the
neck till he be dead,

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:16.225
dead, dead!

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:18.094
Now, do you have anything
to say, young man?

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.934
Yes, Your Honor, I do.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.818
You can go to hell, hell, hell!

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:34.493
I got 18 dimes in
each barrel, boy.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.660
You ever see what $1.80
can do to a $40 steer?

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.830
Let alone a cheap little
crook like yourself.

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:49.584
You just taunt me again, boy.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:52.420
That's all I'm asking.
Just taunt me again.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.464
I want to talk to Garrett.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:55.510
He's in Mesilla.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.764
<i>Got</i> a <i>big</i> interview <i>and</i> a
<i>tintype</i> with <i>the Independent.</i>

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:00.646
Oh, yes.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.434
Famous man now.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.557
Hey, Bell,

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:08.360
did you send my letter to the
Governor, or did you burn it?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.854
It was sent, Kid.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.277
The Sheriff had me put it
on the mail stage myself.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:13.524
Then why isn't he answerin'?

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:17.783
I don't know. Maybe he ain't
one for correspondence.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.122
My sister up in
Colorado's like that...

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.662
Will you just shut
the hell up, Bell?

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:32.887
Chavez.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.011
Chavez, you all right?

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.256
What?

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:39.805
Yeah.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.052
Yeah.

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.059
- You?
- Just fine.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:50.446
Just fine.

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:57.489
Okay, Bell, here's another one to prove
that the hand is quicker than your mind.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:58.986
Are you ready? Are you watching?

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:21.433
- Ma'am?
- Hello, Jane.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:25.183
May I visit Mr. Bonney?
I'm an old acquaintance.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:27.022
No, ma'am. That ain't possible.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.062
Sheriff Garrett won't
allow any visitations.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.778
Well, may I leave a
gift for him then?

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.283
You open up a new rooming
establishment, Greathouse?

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.160
Hell, no.

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:46.705
I opened a good sawdust-on-the-floor,
proper whorehouse.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.381
Ma'am?

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.716
Goodbye, William H. Bonney.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.801
Thank you.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.193
Oops!

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:19.408
All right, Kid. Let your squirrel go.
Move it, pronto.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:29.118
I wouldn't go in
there if I were you.

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.261
Kid? Hey...

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.606
<i>Yoo-hoo, Bell?</i>

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.101
I'll make you famous.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:02.277
Don't do it, Bell. Bell, come on,
don't do it. I ain't kidding.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:03.402
Bell!

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.616
That was stupid, Bell.

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:11.870
Bell kill him? Did
Bell kill the Kid?

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.425
Hello, Bob!

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.180
Shit.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:27.350
Goodbye, Bob.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:31.351
Best $1.80 I ever spent.

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:56.004
Quit nappin' on the job, Bob!

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:18.821
Hey, uh...

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:21.530
Is this Old Mexico here?

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.367
Uh...

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.792
I made it.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:37.459
Well, you do know
who I am, don't ya?

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:40.337
Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:42.964
You know the name?

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:51.802
They know the name.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:15.640
You're not dead.

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:16.975
Do I look dead?

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.979
You should've seen the short
work I made of Bob Ollinger.

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.977
Spread him out like Tularosa.

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:29.074
We're skinning out.

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:32.741
There's a herd of slow elk resting
at Grezchelowski's sheep camp.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:36.366
We'll cut 'em, then
we'll ride for Canada.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.994
Chavez, make sure the
horses are watered.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:41.704
Hendry...

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:43.547
I'll be staying here.

01:27:44.342 --> 01:27:46.128
<i>You stay here and
Garrett'“ take you.</i>

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:48.502
Garrett already took me.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.263
When?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.181
When he took Doc.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.697
That's a bad shot, Chavez.

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:18.706
A man gets shot
like that, it's...

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:20.617
It's over.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.477
Well, I guess...

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:46.102
I guess I really got us
into it this time, huh?

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:55.904
It ain't supposed to be you
sittin' there like that.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.036
It's supposed to be me.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.053
Where you goin'?

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.363
Chavez?

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.583
Chavez.

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:24.370
Buckshot George.

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:27.165
That's your name.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:30.668
You wanted a name. That's it.

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:33.302
Buckshot George.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:35.547
It's a good name.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:40.094
My name's Hendry William French.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:45.266
That's a good name, too.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:30.288
In the ice house. A fresh beef.

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:33.788
Pete Maxwell butchered
this morning.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.799
Bring back here and
I cook for you.

01:32:38.845 --> 01:32:40.631
You are hungry, no?

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:47.134
<i>Si, tengo hambre.</i>

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.591
Let's finish the game.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.192
Pete.

01:33:41.074 --> 01:33:43.862
Pete, did you butcher
this morning?

01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:49.912
<i>Quien es?</i>

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.544
I shot everything in
the world except you.

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:02.793
But you still wouldn't go below.
Why?

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:06.338
The same reason you couldn't
stay here and run a <i>cantina.</i>

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:10.301
But you'd be alive. In Old
Mexico you'd be alive.

01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:13.303
I'm still alive, Pat.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.473
And I belong here.

01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:20.439
Not no more, Billy.

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:23.947
The people like me here.
They want me here.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:26.199
Not no more, Billy.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:34.120
You gonna shoot me, Pat?

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:35.288
I got no choice.

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:38.165
What are you waiting for?

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.922
You could let me go, Pat.

01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:48.092
I could walk out that door, and
head straight for Old Mexico.

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:50.261
You could say you killed me
and no one would ever know.

01:34:50.643 --> 01:34:52.429
You'd come back.

01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:55.429
Like a damn nightmare, you'd show
up in Arizona, stealing cows.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.896
Then they'd stone me.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:58.644
You killed the boys, Patsy.

01:35:03.198 --> 01:35:04.609
No, Billy.

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:06.617
You did.

01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:10.615
If I was with ya,
I'd be one of them.

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:12.529
This hurts, Kid.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:18.661
But I'm in a place I can't get
out of, and I gotta do it.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:22.925
Yeah.

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:26.668
You got to do it, Pat.

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:34.468
Do it.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:50.780
I always said that if
I cared for someone,

01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.154
there's nothing I
would fail to do.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.414
So I'm gonna make
it easy on you.

01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:08.718
You remember somethin', Pat.

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:10.837
You'll never be me.

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:14.425
You'll only be the man
that shot Billy the Kid.

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:16.556
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:21.223
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> you
crazy son of a bitch.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.172
Remember, William Bonney,

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:30.338
dust thou art and unto
dust thou shalt return.

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:40.765
<i>I never stole a horse from
someone I didn't like.</i>

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:42.938
<i>Did I like him?</i>

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:44.814
<i>Hell, no.</i>

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:47.771
I loved the son of a bitch.

01:37:50.406 --> 01:37:52.443
You ask me if I have scars.

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:54.987
Yes, sir.

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.614
I have my scars.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:05.835
Mr. Roberts.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:08.504
Bill, wait.

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:14.971
Billy!

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:20.054
I don't think so, Dave.

01:38:31.823 --> 01:38:32.984
Pals.

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:43.917
<i>Ash leeh!</i>

01:38:51.551 --> 01:38:54.043
<i>I wake up in the morning</i>

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:57.171
<i>And I raise my weary head</i>

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:00.515
<i>I've got an old
coat for a pillow</i>

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:03.101
<i>And the earth was
last night's bed</i>

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.517
<i>I don't know where I'm going</i>

01:39:06.524 --> 01:39:09.733
<i>Only God knows where I've been</i>

01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:11.521
<i>I'm a devil on the run</i>

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:13.019
<i>A six-gun lover</i>

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:15.397
<i>A candle in the wind</i>

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:16.898
<i>Yeah</i>

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:23.288
I'll make you famous.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:30.582
<i>When you're brought
into this world</i>

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:34.049
<i>They say you're born in sin</i>

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.543
<i>Well at least they
gave me something</i>

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:39.842
<i>I didn't have to
steal or have to win</i>

01:39:39.849 --> 01:39:42.932
<i>Well, they tell me
that I'm wanted</i>

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:46.223
<i>Yeah, I'm a wanted man</i>

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.720
<i>I'm a colt in your stable</i>

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:49.393
<i>I'm what Cain was to Abel</i>

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.858
<i>Mister, catch me if you can</i>

01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:57.948
<i>I'm going down in
a blaze of glory</i>

01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:02.615
<i>Take me now but know the truth</i>

01:40:03.789 --> 01:40:10.081
<i>I'm going down in
a blaze of glory</i>

01:40:10.087 --> 01:40:12.249
<i>Lord, I never drew first</i>

01:40:12.256 --> 01:40:13.792
<i>But I drew first blood</i>

01:40:13.799 --> 01:40:15.585
<i>I'm the devil's son</i>

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:18.005
<i>Call me young gun</i>

01:40:46.791 --> 01:40:52.662
<i>Shot down in a blaze of glory</i>

01:40:52.672 --> 01:40:58.293
<i>Take me now but know the truth</i>

01:40:58.302 --> 01:41:05.049
<i>I'm going out in
a blaze of glory</i>

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:06.970
<i>Lord, I never drew first</i>

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:08.639
<i>But I drew first blood</i>

01:41:08.646 --> 01:41:10.307
<i>And I'm no one's son</i>

01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:13.648
<i>Call me young gun</i>

01:41:16.112 --> 01:41:21.858
<i>I'm a young gun</i>

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:26.824
<i>Young gun</i>

01:41:28.874 --> 01:41:33.664
<i>Young gun</i>

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:59.982
<i>I've just seen trouble</i>

01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:03.448
<i>He's calling out
your name tonight</i>

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:06.193
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:10.663
<i>You could walk away but I
know you were born to fight</i>

01:42:10.666 --> 01:42:13.374
<i>80 Billy, get your guns</i>

01:42:13.377 --> 01:42:18.338
<i>The bandileros are strung
out in the promenade</i>

01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:21.208
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:42:21.218 --> 01:42:25.928
<i>And the wind whispers softly
that the devil's to blame</i>

01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:27.968
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:30.888
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:35.230
<i>There's trouble blowing
like a hurricane</i>

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:38.065
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:41.778
<i>That's the price on your
head for the price of fame</i>

01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:44.569
<i>And it'll never change</i>

01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:48.489
<i>They christened you with whiskey</i>

01:42:48.496 --> 01:42:52.740
<i>And there's fire running
through your veins</i>

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:55.993
<i>Well, you're an
outlaw just the same</i>

01:42:57.088 --> 01:43:01.298
<i>And every night a
bullet wears your name</i>

01:43:14.647 --> 01:43:17.605
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:43:17.608 --> 01:43:22.068
<i>There's trouble blowing
like a hurricane</i>

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:24.938
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:28.613
<i>That's the price on your
head for the price of fame</i>

01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:31.657
<i>And it'll never change</i>

01:43:31.664 --> 01:43:35.282
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:42.789
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:49.758
<i>Billy, get your guns</i>
