Changing the past
is very dangerous...

34:06.280 --> 34:08.328
Erica Kravid imprisoned you.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.646
She used you.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.085
She slaughtered thousands
on June 13th,

34:13.159 --> 34:16.687
the day my daughter died. She killed
your friends, she killed my friend,

34:17.880 --> 34:21.804
and now she wants the world to burn.
And she's gonna succeed,

34:22.600 --> 34:24.489
unless you help me stop her.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.324
By imprisoning me,

34:30.120 --> 34:35.206
Erica Kravid bent time
for her own benefit.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.331
That is a wrong
that must be corrected.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.130
I will take you back,
Noah, to June 13th.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.127
But promise me we will not
step on any butterflies.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.846
Yes, yes. I promise.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.605
Just take me back.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.087
Okay.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.522
FEMALE TV ANNOUNCER:

35:40.760 --> 35:43.366
Hero Truther,
if you're out there,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.490
my name is Taylor Kravid.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.651
My mother is Erica Kravid,
CEO of Renautas.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.810
She's not who she says she is,

35:50.880 --> 35:53.486
and her company doesn't do
what it says it does.

35:54.040 --> 35:58.045
Those 600 missing Evos,
she took them.

36:00.520 --> 36:03.126
DEARING: All these missing Evos,
here's where they've gone.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.565
Stop here.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.284
(ENGINE SHUTS OFF)

36:07.360 --> 36:08.930
Gotta switch places with you

36:09.000 --> 36:11.082
if I'm gonna pass you off
as a bounty.

36:11.720 --> 36:15.247
I've got a vested interest
in your success.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.925
You got my money, remember?

36:26.760 --> 36:28.091
(SIGHS)

36:28.600 --> 36:30.602
Sunstone Manor.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.966
It's just on the other side
of those trees.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.088
No guards, no fences.

36:37.160 --> 36:40.164
There's something strange
about the place.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.208
No one ever wants to leave.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.121
One problem.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.531
I don't have any powers.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.130
Don't need 'em.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.725
You drink this,
doesn't give you powers,

36:51.800 --> 36:54.485
but your swab will read
a false positive.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.970
We go in, find your nephew
and the priest,

36:58.320 --> 36:59.765
and we get the hell out of here.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.044
(SNIFFS)

37:07.400 --> 37:09.209
(CLEARS THROAT)
All right.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.170
(COUGHING)

37:24.640 --> 37:26.005
(GRUNTING)
What's going on?

37:26.360 --> 37:28.488
(GROANING LOUDLY)

37:30.160 --> 37:31.810
What's happening to me?

37:33.280 --> 37:34.486
What did you...

37:35.160 --> 37:36.764
(GRUNTS)

37:38.000 --> 37:39.490
(SCREAMING)

37:41.720 --> 37:43.643
Oh, did I leave that part out?

37:54.080 --> 37:55.161
Thanks.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.446
Here.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.801
Eat.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.729
Well, if you're not gonna eat,

38:05.800 --> 38:09.282
you can at least tell me why
you tried to kill yourself.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.008
I used to believe in something.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.403
I had a purpose,
a reason for living.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.840
But then I lost it.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.608
I was just looking for a sign.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.084
I'm looking for something, too.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.089
Someone, actually.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.126
Seven billion people
in the world,

38:42.360 --> 38:44.567
and I'm supposed
to find one of them.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.126
Crazy, huh?

38:52.200 --> 38:53.645
Where did you get this?

38:54.640 --> 38:55.926
You know him?

38:56.920 --> 38:58.684
(LAUGHS) Really?

38:58.760 --> 39:01.843
I mean, I don't... I don't
know him exactly, but...

39:01.920 --> 39:03.410
But you know where he is?

39:03.480 --> 39:06.165
He's in Carbondale, Illinois,
last time I saw him.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.166
It's a sign, Luke.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.809
That's why we met,
why I had to save you.

39:13.600 --> 39:14.806
I have to find him.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.686
Why?

39:18.680 --> 39:21.445
Because together, we're
gonna save the world.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.286
(CHUCKLES)

39:27.600 --> 39:29.409
(LAUGHS)

39:38.920 --> 39:40.604
Then we better get going.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.685
(TOMMY WINCES)
EMILY: Sorry.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.562
(GRUNTS)
<i>- Wow. Okay .</i>

39:47.640 --> 39:50.610
You know, the whole ice cream
thing doesn't work out,

39:50.680 --> 39:52.648
you should definitely think
about becoming a surgeon.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.768
(BOTH LAUGHING)

39:56.840 --> 39:58.808
So what are you
gonna do with it?

40:01.640 --> 40:03.722
I hear Antarctica's pretty
nice this time of year.

Look, about today...

40:26.000 --> 40:27.126
Thank you.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.531
(LAUGHS) What are
you talking about?

40:28.600 --> 40:29.806
You're the one
who took me to Paris.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.848
You know what I'm talking about.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.410
We haven't known
each other long,

40:33.480 --> 40:36.643
but I feel like
you've known me forever,

40:38.360 --> 40:39.850
and that feels...

40:41.840 --> 40:43.649
Really good. (CHUCKLES)

40:50.360 --> 40:52.488
(SIGHS) Okay.
(CHUCKLES)

40:52.560 --> 40:54.562
That felt pretty good, too.
