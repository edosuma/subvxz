(bell chiming)

00:13.614 --> 00:17.016
(western guitar melody)

00:43.177 --> 00:46.211
(wind howling)

00:46.213 --> 00:50.149
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

00:51.318 --> 00:53.619
(shooting)

00:56.323 --> 00:57.923
(speaking in foreign language)

00:57.925 --> 01:01.193
- [Mannie] They're
shooting, homie!

01:01.195 --> 01:03.762
(shooting)

01:03.764 --> 01:05.998

01:06.000 --> 01:07.166
Get him, esse!

01:07.168 --> 01:08.000
Get him!

01:08.002 --> 01:08.867
- [Mannie] I'm trying to drive!

01:08.869 --> 01:10.602
- Then drive the car!

01:13.007 --> 01:16.175
(speaking in foreign language)

01:16.177 --> 01:18.444

01:20.381 --> 01:22.014
You're dead, bitch!

01:22.016 --> 01:25.984
(shouting in foreign language)

01:33.794 --> 01:34.860
- [Shooter] Fuck
Mannie, what the hell

01:34.862 --> 01:37.062

01:37.064 --> 01:39.431
(shooting)

01:43.904 --> 01:47.039
(music intensifying)

02:02.890 --> 02:05.224
(shooting)

02:06.160 --> 02:07.126
- Get them!

02:07.128 --> 02:08.894
Don't let them get away, go!

02:08.896 --> 02:10.129
- You're dead, cabron!

02:10.131 --> 02:12.464
(shooting)

02:15.669 --> 02:16.902
- Put it down!

02:16.904 --> 02:19.138
Put it down, motherfucker!

02:20.841 --> 02:21.907
Put it down!

02:23.410 --> 02:25.344
- Freeze, motherfucker!

02:28.516 --> 02:29.348
- Over there!

02:29.350 --> 02:30.415
Right there!

02:32.620 --> 02:36.355
(ominous atmosphere music)

02:36.357 --> 02:38.357
- Tough guy huh?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.092
Fuck you looking at?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.094
What?

02:42.096 --> 02:42.995
What?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.764
Fuck you gonna do?

02:45.766 --> 02:46.665
Nothing.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.001
Get down on your fucking knees.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.506
Get your fucking hands off me.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.808
- You're one dirty (mumbles).

02:56.810 --> 02:58.010
- [Gangster] Don't
fucking touch me.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.111
- We fucking trusted
you, asshole.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.229
(speaking in foreign language)

03:00.230 --> 03:01.346
- Where did you think
you were gonna go?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.682
(shooting)

03:04.618 --> 03:06.385
Did I fucking say to shoot?

03:06.387 --> 03:07.186
- No.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.153
- Did I fucking tell you?

03:08.155 --> 03:09.054
- No.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.055
- Dumb fuck.

03:11.992 --> 03:12.858
Bitch.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.295
Yeah, fucking shake.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.196
Fucking shake!

03:18.065 --> 03:20.866
(mock quivering)

03:21.969 --> 03:23.168
You afraid?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.570
- Si.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.471
- You should be
fucking scared, bitch.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.406
The fuck you think?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.141
You were gonna get away with it?

03:29.143 --> 03:31.310
(mock quivering)

03:31.312 --> 03:32.477
What are you gonna do?

03:32.479 --> 03:34.546
Fucking leave with my missile?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.814
And fucking take off?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.649
(speaking in foreign language)

03:37.651 --> 03:38.717
- I don't give a fuck.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.752
(speaking in foreign language)

03:40.754 --> 03:42.020
- You should've
thought of that huh?

03:42.022 --> 03:45.924
(speaking in foreign language)

03:45.926 --> 03:46.758
- A lady?

03:46.760 --> 03:47.593
- Si.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.427
- A mujer?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.328
- Si.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.098
- I'll take care of
your fucking lady.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.200
(laughing)

03:55.202 --> 03:56.835
(praying in foreign language)

03:56.837 --> 03:58.337
Adios, motherfucker!

03:58.339 --> 04:01.006
(blood splattering)

04:01.008 --> 04:04.643
(dramatic orchestra music)

04:50.758 --> 04:53.558
(plane whirring)

05:04.405 --> 05:08.140
(dramatic atmosphere music)

05:09.410 --> 05:13.378
(speaking in foreign language)

05:17.584 --> 05:18.583
- Just you.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.157
- What we got?

05:26.193 --> 05:27.326
- We've had eyes
on two small groups

05:27.328 --> 05:29.194
of illegals who crossed at 0500.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.765
Bennet and Lambert
took Macintosh to
get the first group.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.967
Orders came in to stand
down on this one though.

05:35.969 --> 05:36.868
- Why?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.638
Civilian paramilitary?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.106
- No, not this time.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.507
There's growing
movement on Mexicans

05:42.509 --> 05:44.876
jacking their own people
after they've crossed.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.278
Squeezing them for
all they've saved,

05:46.280 --> 05:48.313
which is all they've got.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.182
- Rolling over on
their own people.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.684
How noble.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.820
- They force the men
to work or kill them.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.221
Rape and traffic the women.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.360
- They keep this up and
you'll be out of a job.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.062
Won't even need a damn wall.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.799
- Without their parents,
the youngest kids

06:07.801 --> 06:09.234
are gonna die in the desert.

06:11.972 --> 06:12.871
- Not today.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.341
You and your team take the bait.

06:16.343 --> 06:20.245
Me, Davis, and Busby, we'll
take the (mumbles) banditos.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.748
No offense.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.887
(shooting)

06:28.889 --> 06:32.891
(shouting in foreign language)

06:51.178 --> 06:53.478
(shooting)

06:57.918 --> 06:59.351
(guns cocking)

06:59.353 --> 07:01.586
(weeping)

07:05.926 --> 07:08.460
- (laughs) Welcome to America.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.498
Do you want to be next?

07:18.138 --> 07:21.039
(guns cocking)

07:21.041 --> 07:21.940
- Please run.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.110
Come on.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.778
Do it!

07:43.597 --> 07:45.063
Now if any of you can
get me drunk enough

07:45.065 --> 07:47.632
at this bachelor
party, I'll tell you

07:47.634 --> 07:49.234
all about this
tight ass back here.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.136
- [Officer] Sounds like you
know a thing or two about it.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.604
- Bushman, I'm
talking about you.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.473
- No way, none of you
bitches are even invited.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.674
Especially not you, Bushman.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.008
(shooting)

07:57.010 --> 07:58.076
- Ambush, ambush!

07:58.078 --> 08:00.412
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

08:00.414 --> 08:02.214
- Jax, you all right?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.783
- It's okay Pete.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.751
I got you, you're good.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.356
- Liddy.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.757
- I'll tell her.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.994
I'll tell her, I promise.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.663
I need cover!

08:18.665 --> 08:20.999
(shooting)

08:38.552 --> 08:41.353
(menacing laugh)

08:46.860 --> 08:48.026
- Poor thing.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.175
- Come out, cabron!

09:04.177 --> 09:05.243
Pinche puto!

09:06.480 --> 09:09.648
(music intensifying)

09:14.087 --> 09:16.655
(shooting)

09:16.657 --> 09:19.424
Now quit wasting my
motherfucking time

09:19.426 --> 09:22.294
and come out before
I shoot this one.

09:23.063 --> 09:23.895
- Okay!

09:23.897 --> 09:24.796
Okay.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.799
Okay, I'm coming out.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.253
- I pictured you being taller.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.056
- Who the fuck are you?

09:51.058 --> 09:52.857
- Who the fuck am I?

09:52.859 --> 09:54.192
Come here, Captain Jax.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.896
I hope that within
time you will see me

09:57.898 --> 09:59.864
as your worst
motherfucking nightmare.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.441
(classical piano music)

10:13.246 --> 10:14.145
- Mmmm.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.083
- How are you folks
doing tonight?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.484
You guys doing all right?

10:19.486 --> 10:20.819
- We're doing fine, thank you.
- We're fine, thanks.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.720
- You're welcome.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.221
- Very nice chap.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.224
- Go to Mexico.
- Amen.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.492
- Damn tootin'.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.097
- Francesco, let's go!

10:32.099 --> 10:34.032
Today, while we're still alive!

10:38.772 --> 10:40.739
- More minestrone, por favor.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.841
We can't get enough over here.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.142
Oh my god.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.244
- Do the thing.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.652
(speaking in foreign language)

10:58.258 --> 11:00.358
- That's what I'm talking about.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.161
Right there, Francesco,
is the reason

11:03.163 --> 11:04.829
why you're my favorite nephew.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.132
This place could
be yours someday.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.266
- That'll be really fun.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.601
- Let's go do this thing huh?

11:09.603 --> 11:12.170
(speaking in foreign language)

11:12.172 --> 11:15.407
(foreign opera music)

11:18.812 --> 11:20.612
- Nice to see you again.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.180
- Good to see you.

11:25.018 --> 11:25.850
- Hey, how are you?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.952
Good to see you.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.154
Young man, nice to see you.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.122
Thank you so much
for coming out.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.390
Hey, was I right
about the spinach?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.625
Amazing huh?

11:33.627 --> 11:35.126
Did I tell you or did I
frickin' tell you huh?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.661
All right gentlemen.

11:36.663 --> 11:39.064
You two, oh marone huh?

11:39.066 --> 11:39.898
Enjoying dinner?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.132
What's happening?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.634
All right good, you old
people, how are you?

11:42.636 --> 11:43.635
What's happening?

11:43.637 --> 11:44.903
Hey little one, how are you?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.171
- How you doing?

11:46.173 --> 11:47.806
- I'm doing fine,
I'm doing fine.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.807
(laughing)

11:48.809 --> 11:50.341
Hey, so how you doing again?

11:50.343 --> 11:51.176
Nice to see you.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.143
Been a long time.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.745
Hey how are you Jill, all right?

11:53.747 --> 11:55.413
Thank you for coming.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.247
It's the family huh?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.016
Looks like a wedding.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.984
Tony, you did a
good thing today.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.653
Great service.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.755
Good lord man, take
your bride home already.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.090
(laughing)

12:05.092 --> 12:06.324
You're a lucky fella.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.027
Bada bing bada boom,
you know what I mean?

12:09.029 --> 12:10.729
You, you could put an eye
out with those things.

12:10.731 --> 12:11.996
- Bad boy.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.198
- There's so much
wood under this table

12:13.200 --> 12:14.699
the fire department's
gonna shut me down.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.667
You know what I mean?

12:15.669 --> 12:16.935
Holy cow.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.770
I gotta get out of here,
can I take her with me?

12:18.772 --> 12:19.871
I'm just kidding, I gotta go.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.672
See you later.

12:20.674 --> 12:21.573
Thanks everybody.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.581
(groaning)

12:32.352 --> 12:36.755
(ominous atmosphere music)

12:36.757 --> 12:37.756
- Where's Davis?

12:39.359 --> 12:40.425
- Agent Davis?

12:41.695 --> 12:44.429
Mr. Davis is having fun
with some of my friends.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.469
- What do you want from us?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.739
- You see, you and
your friend have made

12:54.741 --> 12:57.108
quite an impression in
protecting the border.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.344
The few.

13:00.781 --> 13:01.713
The proud.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.384
And it is true that
there are few of you now.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.621
I am so proud of that.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.759
Unfortunately, you have made it

13:14.761 --> 13:17.929
very challenging
for me and friends.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.465
(speaking in foreign language)

13:20.467 --> 13:21.466
- Matutero.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.402
- Oh, you know about us?

13:26.640 --> 13:27.939
I am so flattered.

13:27.941 --> 13:28.940
(whip cracking)

13:28.942 --> 13:29.774
(man screaming)

13:29.776 --> 13:30.742
Ouch.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.143
Do you hear that?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.212
Sounds like they're
having a lot of fun.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.516
Fuck this.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.851
Let's cut to the chase.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.654
You're gonna make some calls.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.990
And making everything
back to normal.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.027
Nothing personal.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.528
It's just business.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.963
- Fuck you!

13:51.965 --> 13:52.931
- Fuck me?

13:52.933 --> 13:53.832
Fuck me!

13:54.935 --> 13:56.167
- I'm not scared to die.

13:58.104 --> 13:58.903
- Maybe not.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.940
But what about sweet Carmen?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.277
Or maybe Sophia?

14:08.982 --> 14:09.881
Maybe they are.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.617
You ever think about that?

14:12.619 --> 14:13.518
Estupido.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.187
Don't fuck with me.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.361
That's okay.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.497
You have it your way.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.398
Pendejo.

14:29.035 --> 14:29.934
- Wait!

14:34.875 --> 14:36.040
I might know someone.

14:38.511 --> 14:38.977
- Oh good.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.548
I thought you would.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.193
- Look at you.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.227
- Mom, stop.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.997
- It is going by too fast.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.499
- You think he'll like it?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.533
- Mmmhm.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.568
I do.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.402
I do.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.603
Maybe a little too much.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.674
(doorbell ringing)

15:09.676 --> 15:11.209
Go have fun.

15:11.211 --> 15:15.280
(gentle piano atmosphere music)

15:17.550 --> 15:19.017
Hi!

15:19.019 --> 15:20.118
- How you doing?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.019
- For me?

15:24.858 --> 15:26.791
- Honey, you look beautiful.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.192
- Daddy.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.694
- There's something
I wanted to tell you.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.529
(knocking)

15:31.531 --> 15:33.631
- Knocky knock knock!

15:33.633 --> 15:34.732
'Sup people?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.868
Scoot over there, Pops.

15:36.870 --> 15:37.902
- Hi Tanner.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.138
- Beep beep, coming through.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.974
This bud's for you.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.309
- This is your date?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.276
Really?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.878
- Yeah daddy, let him in.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.112
That's Tanner.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.981
- Dude, what the heck?

15:49.983 --> 15:50.949
I'm starving.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.384
- Okay, you and I?

15:53.386 --> 15:54.452
We're gonna go have
a walk, come on.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.721
- Daddy, be nice.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.723
- Sorry, I kinda
munched on it a little.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.158
(laughing)

16:03.296 --> 16:04.312
- Hey, hey!

16:04.313 --> 16:05.329
- Son, I need you
to put the bong down

16:05.332 --> 16:07.966
long enough to
understand something.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.567
There's nothing more important

16:09.569 --> 16:11.736
in my life than that
little girl up there.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.174
I don't know if she
lost a bet or what.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.577
But we both know that
she's out of your league.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.913
And I wanna make sure
that we both understand

16:21.915 --> 16:23.648
that I would do
anything to protect her.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.116
Anything.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.652
And if anything bad
would happen to her,

16:27.654 --> 16:29.153
I feel sorry for those guys.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.322
- Whoa.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.424
Nice wheels.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.826
- Yeah, well thanks.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.829
You know, these
trunks aren't bad.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.533
- Dude.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.802
- So you know, you
could put two people

16:44.804 --> 16:46.204
in that trunk, it's so big.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.607
So what were we talking about?

16:49.609 --> 16:53.878
- That I need to have your
daughter home very early.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.446
- Now that's a great idea.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.050
You know Tucker, you're
really starting to grow on me.

16:59.052 --> 16:59.951
- It's Tanner.

16:59.953 --> 17:00.785
- Yeah, whatever.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.686
Beat it.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.523
Nice talk.

17:16.903 --> 17:17.902
- You said 50 bucks!

17:17.904 --> 17:19.504
- Oh yeah, my bad.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.471
Here.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.274
You want me to take you to...

17:27.080 --> 17:28.413
Yeah, whatever.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.123
(car revving)

17:58.011 --> 17:59.343
(phone ringing)

17:59.345 --> 18:00.745
Go for Spencer.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.180
- [Gangster] Listen up, payaso.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.381
- Who is this?

18:03.383 --> 18:05.049
- [Gangster] I work for
the Matutero Cartel.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.284
- How'd you get my number?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.186
- [Gangster] You need
to do a job for us.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.687
We'll text you where.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.922
- Yeah, I'll be there.

18:14.527 --> 18:18.162
(ominous atmosphere music)

18:40.720 --> 18:42.887
- You know that's
bad for you right?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.156
- So is not returning
my phone calls.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.390
(chuckling)

18:46.392 --> 18:47.925
- You think you're
the only politician

18:47.927 --> 18:50.094
on our speed dial, huh puto?

18:50.096 --> 18:52.630
- Hey man, lighten up.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.632
You cartels are so uptight.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.901
I came all the way down
here with the support

18:56.903 --> 19:00.338
of those fine people
of the Sunshine State,

19:00.340 --> 19:02.340
who send their
regards by the way,

19:02.342 --> 19:04.308
and I'd hate to go
home empty handed.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.812
It'd be like going to
Taco Bell in Tijuana.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.081
That shit doesn't make
any sense, you know?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.617
But I love what you've
done with the place.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.318
Smells like shit though.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.589
Smells like...

19:18.591 --> 19:20.424
No wonder you wanna
get out of this place.

19:20.426 --> 19:24.162
- I thought we were clear
on we're terms, Senator.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.429
- Oh well.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.764
I can always start doing
business with Lorenzo.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.167
- What do you mean by that?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.268
- Hey fuck you.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.202
I need to renegotiate.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.703
End of story.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.273
(laughing)

19:35.275 --> 19:36.674
No.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.776
Fuck you, pendejo.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.677
Fuck you.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.356
(distant clinking)

20:06.739 --> 20:08.039
- (gasps) You!

20:08.041 --> 20:09.473
- You scared me
half to death, man.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.542
- Shit, I nearly shit
my pants, Uncle Stony.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.510
What are you doing here?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.812
- I came to get some things.

20:14.814 --> 20:15.646
- You okay boss?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.648
You seem kinda off.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.651
- Yeah, I'll be okay though.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.820
- Just wanna make
sure you're okay.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.655
- Training boy, go home.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.157
Spend some time with the family.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.658
Make breakfast for the kids.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.061
Best of all, make love to
your wife in the daytime.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.112
Now get outta here.

20:31.113 --> 20:32.162
- I just wanna make
sure you're okay.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.264
- I'm okay, capiche?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.165
Get outta here.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.616
(tracker beeping)

21:34.794 --> 21:37.795
(car horn blaring)

21:41.467 --> 21:43.467
Pretty please, God, no!

21:43.469 --> 21:44.435
No no!

21:44.437 --> 21:45.770
(tires screeching)

21:45.772 --> 21:50.808
The fuck?

21:57.583 --> 21:58.516
I'm so sorry.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.318
I'm so sorry for leaving you.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.186
I gotta go, I'm gonna
make this right.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.793
- [Gangster] Mira.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.861
Keep an eye out for him.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.335
(Spanish rock music)

22:28.681 --> 22:29.580
- Morning.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.521
You got that kinda
flip-flopped there.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.657
There you go.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.624
"Thank you."

22:40.626 --> 22:41.625
There you go, you're welcome.

22:44.397 --> 22:48.399
(speaking in foreign language)

22:56.008 --> 22:57.241
- Good talk there, Poncho.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.409
I don't know what
they're paying you,

22:58.411 --> 22:59.744
but it's too damn much.

23:04.984 --> 23:08.619
(ominous atmosphere music)

23:16.396 --> 23:20.398
(speaking in foreign language)

23:29.175 --> 23:31.375
- So you are the cook.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.411
- Chef.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.311
Here's my card.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.248
- Drink?

23:37.250 --> 23:38.282
- I don't drink.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.183
I like to cook.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.054
- Power.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.556
What's your power?

23:45.558 --> 23:46.457
- I'm Italian.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.930
- Make pasta not war?

23:52.932 --> 23:53.864
- Kinda cute.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.132
You know, it's like a tagline.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.302
- What kind of name is Stone?

23:58.304 --> 23:59.403
- Kids are mean.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.805
Got teased when I was a kid.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.273
You know, sticks and stones?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.444
This one time I got
really pissed off.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.413
I threw a rock at a shortstop.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.148
Jose Rodriguez.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.716
The name just kinda stuck.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.385
Our coach saw that
I could throw hard

24:14.387 --> 24:16.554
and moved me over to to pitcher.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.322
No one's fucked
with me ever since.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.127
No, that's not quite true.

24:24.964 --> 24:29.066
I had a run in with a
guy at work 20 years ago.

24:29.068 --> 24:32.303
By the name of
Guadeloupe Gonzalez.

24:33.439 --> 24:36.807
I guess I don't get
along with Mexicans.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.243
Damn.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.878
You should've been a therapist.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.415
I haven't opened up
like this in years.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.349
Feels good.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.653
So what are we doing here?

24:50.756 --> 24:52.756
- It appears we've made
some kind of mistake.

24:53.493 --> 24:54.925
- Mistake?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.261
- You see, I need someone
with special skills.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.663
Not some old pasta cook.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.265
(laughing)

25:01.267 --> 25:04.101
- Look, I might be a little
bit old, but I'm your guy.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.503
I can get shit done.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.105
- You know why you're here?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.473
- Enlighten me.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.842
- We blew our cover
and we need your help.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.043
- Again?

25:13.045 --> 25:14.278
- We'll owe you.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.479
I'll owe you.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.981
- You still owe me
for the last two hits

25:16.983 --> 25:18.449
I did for you and your guys.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.119
- We need you to do the
Italian thing again.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.554
- It's what I do.

25:24.790 --> 25:25.689
I don't know.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.192
- Come on, we're friends.

25:29.795 --> 25:33.230
- If I do this, it's
for the last time.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.665
- Last time.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.566
Promise.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.037
- What's the mark?

25:44.210 --> 25:45.976
(speaking in foreign language)

25:45.978 --> 25:48.312
(laughing)

25:50.383 --> 25:52.182
- Escuchame.

25:52.184 --> 25:55.319
I have a very important
present coming from Cuba.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.488
We need someone to make
sure it arrives safely.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.257
It is fragile.

26:01.661 --> 26:05.162
And I don't like my presents
being tampered with or opened.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.463
Especially before I do.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.066
Spoils the surprise.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.068
- Why me?

26:12.171 --> 26:13.737
- It appears I have
something you want

26:13.739 --> 26:16.173
in exchange for
something that I want.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.475
It's the world's oldest
business transaction.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.177
- What?

26:20.179 --> 26:22.012
You wanna blow me?

26:22.014 --> 26:23.414
Come on, man.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.515
- It's a trade.

26:24.517 --> 26:26.183
Nothing personal.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.885
Just business.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.754
But make no mistake,
senorita Spencer.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.690
I am very committed
to my business.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.558
And no one, especially some old

26:34.560 --> 26:36.727
pasta cook, is gonna stop me.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.195
- How do I know
he's still alive?

26:38.197 --> 26:39.163
- You don't.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.932
Actually I saw him today.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.302
But I can't say he was
having his best day.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.272
(chuckling)

26:48.274 --> 26:52.276
(speaking in foreign language)

27:01.220 --> 27:02.353
- Hang in there, kid.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.388
- Dad!

27:04.390 --> 27:05.389
Don't do it!

27:05.391 --> 27:06.690
They know about mom and--

27:09.729 --> 27:10.628
- Dad?

27:11.664 --> 27:12.596
You gotta be kidding me.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.231
You're his fucking daddy?

27:14.233 --> 27:15.165
(laughing)

27:15.167 --> 27:16.934
This is fucking awesome.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.802
- Yeah, you're right.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.672
America's greatest dad.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.741
Actually we haven't seen
each other in a while.

27:23.743 --> 27:24.942
A long while.

27:24.944 --> 27:28.479
- Look, I get no joy
from killing your son.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.247
But I will if I have to.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.583
Especially if you don't have
what I need in three days.

27:32.585 --> 27:36.553
(speaking in foreign language)

27:46.932 --> 27:50.567
(ominous atmosphere music)

28:14.960 --> 28:17.261
(knocking)

28:48.728 --> 28:51.695
- I'm gonna get you, buddy.

28:51.697 --> 28:52.896
Just hang on.

29:09.749 --> 29:10.581
- Mom.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.482
- Yes baby girl?

29:12.585 --> 29:15.686
- You think dad will
ever, you know...

29:15.688 --> 29:16.653
- Come back?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.692
Aren't you supposed
to be helping me?

29:23.729 --> 29:27.531
Carmen honey, I don't know.

29:27.533 --> 29:28.732
I don't know.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.300
And you know, I gotta
tell you that things

29:30.302 --> 29:31.635
are actually pretty
good right now.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.637
Maybe we're better
off as friends.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.875
Sweet girl, your dad is...

29:37.877 --> 29:42.045
He's very hard to be
married to sometimes.

29:42.047 --> 29:45.382
But I want you to know
that I love him very much.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.252
- But I know that he loves you.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.254
- He's married to
the restaurant.

29:50.256 --> 29:55.325
And we don't do anything
exciting anymore.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.594
You can set your
clock by the guy.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.296
It's the same thing every day.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.166
He's boring.

30:04.403 --> 30:08.372
(speaking in foreign language)

30:10.309 --> 30:12.075
- You will go with
my men to Mexico.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.379
And (mumbles) a safe
passage across the border.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.649
Here.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.084
This is where the cargo
will load into the plane.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.286
- A plane?

30:22.288 --> 30:24.087
How am I supposed to
get a friggin' plane?

30:24.089 --> 30:25.823
- You have connections.

30:25.825 --> 30:26.723
Make it happen.

30:27.593 --> 30:28.792
Mira.

30:28.794 --> 30:30.661
You will take the
first payment here.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.032
What is that?

30:35.033 --> 30:35.632
What are you doing
with your eyes?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.367
Can you see or not?

30:37.369 --> 30:38.335
- I can see fine.

30:39.605 --> 30:40.571
- You can see fine?

30:43.008 --> 30:44.675
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.511
You cannot fuck this up.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.779
Can you see or not?

30:50.382 --> 30:51.248
- I got it.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.017
- Good.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.555
You will continue with the
immigrants from Sonata.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.992
Across the Arizona border.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.895
Where you will deliver them
and take the second payment.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.497
These passengers are
very important to me.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.466
You screw this up, do me a favor

31:09.468 --> 31:10.834
and just put a fucking
bullet in your head

31:10.836 --> 31:12.236
and consider yourself dead.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.372
(speaking in foreign language)

31:15.374 --> 31:17.374
- I got it, El Chopo Whopo.

31:23.048 --> 31:27.384
- Once I have confirmation,
your son will be released.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.220
And you will never
hear from us again.

31:34.727 --> 31:38.996
- And I'm supposed to take
your word as a Catholic?

31:38.998 --> 31:39.897
- Mira, amigo.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.000
We are just doing our jobs.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.968
We are very alike, whether
you like it or not.

31:53.679 --> 31:58.415
- Well to me it's gonna look
like I'm gonna throw in.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.552
- [Player] Fuck you always
have to be the big baller?

32:02.554 --> 32:05.088
- Because I think I
can beat you guys.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.356
Okay?

32:06.357 --> 32:07.623
- [Player] Only thing
you beat me with is age.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.059
- Come on guys, just
let him (mumbles).

32:09.061 --> 32:10.027
- [Second Player]
Why you let him

32:10.029 --> 32:11.528
punk you like that, Gordido?

32:11.530 --> 32:13.030
- 'Cause he's my little baby.

32:13.032 --> 32:17.034
(speaking in foreign language)

32:23.776 --> 32:25.542
(coughing)

32:25.544 --> 32:29.179
(ominous atmosphere music)

32:40.426 --> 32:41.558
- I got you, buddy.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.394
- Thank god you're here.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.663
(groaning)

32:48.100 --> 32:49.232
- Come on, man.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.134
Let's get out of here.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.342
(distant conversing)

33:01.080 --> 33:02.779
- [Old Man] Taught me a
couple of things over here.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.514
- Hey hey, let's just...

33:04.516 --> 33:05.315
- [Old Man] All right.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.316
I'm gonna make the bet.

33:07.686 --> 33:11.321
(ominous atmosphere music)

33:42.488 --> 33:43.387
- Who won?

33:44.890 --> 33:46.890
That wasn't here.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.025
Who fucking won?

33:50.295 --> 33:53.330
- Jefecito, I watched
that fucker good.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.898
I've been with you cinco anos.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.734
- Por favor.

33:57.736 --> 33:58.869
It won't happen again.

34:03.976 --> 34:05.475
- Then who was sitting here?

34:12.017 --> 34:15.852
(speaking in foreign language)

34:15.854 --> 34:16.753
- Pablo.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.892
- Pablo?

34:21.894 --> 34:23.794
- [Old Man] Sir senor.

34:26.498 --> 34:27.397
- Pablo.

34:29.334 --> 34:30.233
Pablo.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.570
(shooting)

34:34.873 --> 34:36.406
Congratulations.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.242
But you never fucking
betray your friends.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.579
Pinche pendejos.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.714
- Vamanos!

35:17.716 --> 35:19.282
Get these fuckers!

35:25.991 --> 35:28.291
(groaning)

35:29.161 --> 35:29.993
- Stay here.

35:29.995 --> 35:30.894
- Jax!

35:31.964 --> 35:34.164
- I'll be back for you.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.799
Just trust me.

35:35.801 --> 35:36.700
- Go.

35:39.404 --> 35:40.237
Go!

35:40.239 --> 35:42.539
(coughing)

35:49.615 --> 35:51.848
(shooting)

35:51.850 --> 35:54.184
(groaning)

35:58.757 --> 36:00.323
- Jax.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.193
You must have less faith
in your father than I do.

36:03.195 --> 36:04.094
Pendejo.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.395
This is all your fault.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.599
(shooting)

36:10.636 --> 36:11.868
Put him in the freezer.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.042
- Hey, it's just me.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.977
I don't know if you got my text,

36:20.979 --> 36:24.381
but she really likes
this Tanner kid.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.350
So anyway, give me a
call if you're home.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.786
Sorry.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.723
(ominous atmosphere music)

36:33.725 --> 36:34.991
- You make sure
that Spencer knows

36:34.993 --> 36:36.726
you and I bumped
into each other.

36:45.671 --> 36:49.639
(speaking in foreign language)

36:58.650 --> 36:59.583
- What?

36:59.585 --> 37:01.084
You never had skid marks before?

37:02.321 --> 37:03.486
- Hey!

37:03.488 --> 37:04.387
Vamanos!

37:07.259 --> 37:08.625
Mr. Spencer.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.996
You know, when I was
a young boy, I lived

37:12.998 --> 37:15.799
in the desert for many years
with my brothers in casas.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.902
We would study los animales.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.423
El Coyote.

37:23.424 --> 37:24.506
El Coyote would look
out for his family.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.111
He would fight to death
to protect his home.

37:30.182 --> 37:31.681
You.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.850
You have a soft spot
for these people.

37:33.852 --> 37:34.751
I can see.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.754
El Coyote.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.590
I can see you're a good man
and you don't belong here.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.695
You see, in this
business you have

37:45.697 --> 37:47.631
to learn to look the other way.

37:49.935 --> 37:50.834
Entiendes?

37:53.872 --> 37:54.771
You'll get it.

37:56.908 --> 37:57.807
It's time.

37:59.044 --> 37:59.943
Take him.

38:08.053 --> 38:08.952
- Move!

38:13.558 --> 38:15.892
I can't drive this pinche truck.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.036
- I'll drive it.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.416
(honking)

38:42.988 --> 38:45.922
(phone ringing)

38:45.924 --> 38:49.459
(speaking in foreign language)

38:49.461 --> 38:51.328
- I'm hearing good things.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.829
- Everything is on track.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.433
There will be no more delays.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.001
- There cannot.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.502
I'm counting on you, Miguel.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.772
- My family means
the world to me.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.040
- Others have disappointed me.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.342
They had to be put down.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.678
But I see a bright
future for you.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.448
- You will have your money.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.116
Plus interest.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.517
Just like I promised.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.286
(speaking in foreign language)

39:16.288 --> 39:18.421
- Let me know when
the delivery arrives.

39:20.959 --> 39:21.858
- Mierda.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.364
(speaking in foreign language)

39:27.366 --> 39:28.498
- You gonna feed those people?

39:28.500 --> 39:29.632
- Fuck those people!

39:29.634 --> 39:31.835
- Hey, you feel them, gringo.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.037
And if anyone escapes, you die.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.138
- Where they gonna go, Vegas?

39:35.140 --> 39:36.039
Dumbass.

39:45.684 --> 39:46.883
It's not much.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.651
Pass it on to everyone.

39:48.653 --> 39:49.552
Everyone.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.055
Share as best you can.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.257
I got another apple here.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.159
(banging)

39:56.161 --> 39:57.827
- Back in the truck!

39:57.829 --> 39:58.728
Now!

40:22.521 --> 40:23.853
- Where's my phone?

40:25.791 --> 40:27.791
- Tweedle Dee, dumb
and dumber, get up!

40:27.793 --> 40:28.691
We're here!

40:43.975 --> 40:46.676
(phone ringing)

40:55.921 --> 40:58.054
(phone buzzing)

40:58.056 --> 40:59.722
(speaking in foreign language)

40:59.724 --> 41:01.624
- Your short game sucks.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.426
- Everything's on track.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.994
There will be no more delays.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.431
- You know, my mother
always used to say

41:08.433 --> 41:10.967
never count your chickens
before they are hatched.

41:12.237 --> 41:15.138
And you know, I never understood
what she meant by that.

41:16.241 --> 41:20.543
Until I made the error
of employing you.

41:22.247 --> 41:25.081
- It was never my intention
to cause any embarrassment.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.918
My family means the world to me.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.154
- Let me be very fucking clear.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.756
You better come up with
that trigger, or I will be

41:33.758 --> 41:37.994
forced to leave the runt
of the litter behind.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.395
- You will have your money.

41:40.465 --> 41:43.266
Plus interest, just
like I promised.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.168
- You never write
a fucking check

41:45.170 --> 41:47.537
that your ass cannot cash.

41:47.539 --> 41:50.940
Three days and I cannot
protect you anymore.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.343
Don't fucking forget
who you're talking to.

41:53.345 --> 41:54.978
Three days!

41:54.980 --> 41:57.514
And I can no longer protect you!

41:57.516 --> 42:01.451
(shouting in foreign language)

42:04.189 --> 42:08.191
(mumbling in foreign language)

42:17.802 --> 42:19.068
- So fucking little.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.338
- Harder to find you, my dear.

42:22.340 --> 42:25.308
Look at what you've been
able to do with a little one.

42:26.811 --> 42:27.710
Very impressive.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.515
I think we're getting really
close to each other here.

42:32.517 --> 42:33.483
No?

42:33.485 --> 42:34.884
- No.

42:34.886 --> 42:35.785
No way.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.788
- Ayudame, stop fucking around.

42:43.328 --> 42:46.963
(ominous atmosphere music)

42:54.172 --> 42:58.107
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

42:59.277 --> 43:00.310
- The fuck?

43:02.280 --> 43:03.546
- Hold it right there!

43:03.548 --> 43:04.747
- Grenade, let's go!

43:04.749 --> 43:06.649
Go, get them, come on!

43:10.922 --> 43:13.256
(shooting)

43:14.359 --> 43:16.793
- Hey, get over
here motherfucker!

43:16.795 --> 43:18.027
Get over here!

43:21.533 --> 43:23.399
Get over here!

43:23.401 --> 43:24.801
Aw shit.

43:24.803 --> 43:27.136
(shooting)

43:35.614 --> 43:36.613
- Get down!

44:17.822 --> 44:19.322
- Senior Jax.

44:20.592 --> 44:21.891
I have good news for you.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.095
Your dad.

44:27.599 --> 44:29.332
The cook made his
first drop off.

44:30.769 --> 44:32.201
Looks like I misjudged him.

44:36.441 --> 44:37.340
- You...

44:38.343 --> 44:39.842
Have no idea.

44:46.685 --> 44:49.852
(clearing throat)

44:49.854 --> 44:53.856
(speaking in foreign language)

45:09.474 --> 45:13.409
(speaking in foreign language)

45:19.784 --> 45:21.317
- Put her in my car.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.986
(laughing)

45:23.988 --> 45:25.655
- I need you to survive.

45:25.657 --> 45:27.857
I need you to take
care of your mommy.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.626
And you gotta come
find me someday.

45:30.628 --> 45:32.195
Do you promise?

45:32.197 --> 45:33.262
- I promise.

45:58.189 --> 46:00.990
(sirens wailing)

46:15.573 --> 46:19.609
(speaking in foreign language)

46:25.917 --> 46:28.251
(knocking)

46:32.390 --> 46:34.357
- Evening fellas.

46:34.359 --> 46:35.591
You look lost.

46:35.593 --> 46:37.293
I don't see a Taco
Bell around here.

46:38.596 --> 46:40.630
How about you let me see your
license and registration.

46:42.066 --> 46:43.065
- Evening sir.

46:43.067 --> 46:44.467
Is there a problem officer?

46:51.943 --> 46:53.109
- Oh my god.

46:53.111 --> 46:55.077
Oh my god, it's you!

46:55.079 --> 46:56.612
You're the guy!

46:56.614 --> 46:57.914
The guy from the movies!

46:57.916 --> 46:59.248
Hey hey, what am I a clown?

46:59.250 --> 47:00.249
I amuse you?

47:00.251 --> 47:01.050
I make you laugh?

47:01.052 --> 47:01.818
I'm here to amuse you?

47:01.820 --> 47:03.419
Come on, you're the guy!

47:03.421 --> 47:05.154
- (chuckles) I get
that all the time.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.088
- Oh come on.

47:06.090 --> 47:07.223
You gotta say that.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.426
Oh god, what's that guy?

47:10.428 --> 47:12.128
That actor off The Sopranos.

47:12.130 --> 47:14.430
My wife's gonna kill me.

47:14.432 --> 47:17.567
Hey, I'm Officer Bianci.

47:17.569 --> 47:20.269
- Well Officer Bianci, it's
a pleasure and an honor

47:20.271 --> 47:23.139
to have a fellow Italian
way the fuck out of here.

47:24.242 --> 47:26.108
I was just telling my
Mexican jumping bean

47:26.110 --> 47:28.311
bodyguards about
our food back home.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.278
- Oof, marone.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.479
Hey, tell me about it.

47:30.481 --> 47:32.114
What I wouldn't give
for some of my grandma's

47:32.116 --> 47:34.750
homemade ossobuco alla milanese.

47:34.752 --> 47:38.621
- (chuckling) Wow, I just
think I creamed my jeans.

47:38.623 --> 47:40.456
(laughing)

47:40.458 --> 47:41.357
- That's great.

47:41.359 --> 47:42.692
- Yeah, they don't get it.

47:42.694 --> 47:43.960
They just don't get it.

47:43.962 --> 47:45.862
Yeah, what a strange
country Mexico huh?

47:45.864 --> 47:47.496
Am I right or am I right?

47:47.498 --> 47:48.698
- Tell me about it.

47:48.700 --> 47:51.367
- I told these guys that
Mexico couldn't have

47:51.369 --> 47:53.669
an Olympic team because
all the swimmers,

47:53.671 --> 47:56.539
jumpers, and runners
are already in the US.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.108
(laughing)

47:59.110 --> 48:00.343
- Hey that's great, man.

48:00.345 --> 48:01.777
That's just great.

48:01.779 --> 48:05.181
Hey listen, can I get a
quick picture with you?

48:05.183 --> 48:06.716
- Yeah sure.

48:06.718 --> 48:07.984
- All right, hey.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.119
My wife, she's never
gonna believe this one.

48:10.121 --> 48:11.053
All right.

48:14.192 --> 48:16.692
(laughs) All right.

48:16.694 --> 48:17.660
- I gotta go.

48:17.662 --> 48:18.628
Gotta get to the set.

48:18.630 --> 48:19.562
- Hey thanks a bunch, mate.

48:19.564 --> 48:20.730
You really made my day.

48:20.732 --> 48:21.998
Hey listen, I got one for you.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.166
How do you stop a Mexican tank?

48:24.168 --> 48:25.334
- Easy.

48:25.336 --> 48:27.003
Shoot the three
guys out pushing it.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.671
(laughing)

48:28.673 --> 48:29.505
Later Officer.

48:29.507 --> 48:30.339
- Hey great, man.

48:30.341 --> 48:31.440
Hey, I'll see you.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.410
- Fucking nuts,
pull out here guys.

48:45.556 --> 48:47.523
Hey, what are you guys, camels?

48:47.525 --> 48:49.258
Don't you ever pee?

48:49.260 --> 48:51.360
Man I gotta use the restroom.

48:51.362 --> 48:52.762
- Fuck.

48:52.764 --> 48:54.230
(speaking in foreign language)

48:54.232 --> 48:56.098
- No, no, number one.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.566
No, not number one.

48:57.568 --> 49:00.603
Number uno, number, how do
you say in Spanish, numero...

49:00.605 --> 49:02.438
Shit man, I gotta take a shit!

49:02.440 --> 49:03.439
- Cerote?

49:03.441 --> 49:04.273
- Si.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.341
- Aw shit!

49:07.011 --> 49:07.843
Fuck.

49:19.724 --> 49:20.623
Hey!

49:20.625 --> 49:22.758
Put the fucking briefcase down!

49:23.861 --> 49:25.127
- This may be too
much information,

49:25.129 --> 49:27.063
but I like to use wet wipes.

49:27.065 --> 49:28.898
Take them with me everywhere.

49:28.900 --> 49:30.399
What?

49:30.401 --> 49:32.735
You don't wipe a baby's ass
with toilet paper do you?

49:32.737 --> 49:34.270
You should try it,
change your life.

49:34.272 --> 49:38.307
(speaking in foreign language)

49:40.912 --> 49:44.013
(store bell ringing)

49:46.217 --> 49:48.918
Yo Lollypop, where's the john?

49:48.920 --> 49:50.419
- The men's is out of order.

49:50.421 --> 49:51.921
- I'll use the ladies room.

49:51.923 --> 49:53.389
- You can't go in there.

49:53.391 --> 49:54.290
Sir!

49:55.994 --> 49:57.193
Baby boomers.

49:58.429 --> 49:59.328
Dick.

50:05.737 --> 50:06.635
- Excuse me?

50:08.406 --> 50:10.172
I'd like to wash my hands.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.340
- Beat it, please?

50:39.937 --> 50:41.203
For the lollipops.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.180
(laughing)

50:51.182 --> 50:53.315
(speaking in foreign language)

50:53.317 --> 50:54.784
- That's right, motherfucker.

50:57.655 --> 50:58.654
- You did good.

50:58.656 --> 51:00.022
You got a good head.

51:00.024 --> 51:01.424
- What, you give good head?

51:03.661 --> 51:04.527
Good to know.

51:04.529 --> 51:05.461
- Oh si, si.

51:36.694 --> 51:37.593
- Who is that?

51:39.197 --> 51:40.496
- Hector.

51:40.498 --> 51:44.433
(speaking in foreign language)

51:44.435 --> 51:45.701
- Fuck.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.536
Could you get any
brighter of a car?

51:47.538 --> 51:49.605
Shit's fucking burning my eyes.

51:49.607 --> 51:50.840
- What, you don't like it?

51:50.842 --> 51:52.174
- No.

51:52.176 --> 51:53.008
- Sorry.

51:53.010 --> 51:54.110
- Get out of the car.

51:56.380 --> 51:57.780
Get out of the fucking car.

51:58.716 --> 52:00.015
- I was just kidding.

52:00.017 --> 52:01.684
You guys are gonna have
a great Olympic team.

52:11.929 --> 52:15.965
(speaking in foreign language)

52:19.737 --> 52:21.670
- Work off some of that pasta!

52:33.651 --> 52:35.851
Hurry up, don't
dent his Ferrari.

52:45.963 --> 52:46.896
- Oh Jesus.

52:55.773 --> 52:59.742
(speaking in foreign language)

53:10.288 --> 53:11.487
- That's the third drop.

53:11.489 --> 53:12.955
I wanna see my son.

53:12.957 --> 53:13.856
- Wait.

53:19.297 --> 53:21.197
Your blinkers, pendejo!

53:21.199 --> 53:23.766
(car revving)

53:38.349 --> 53:42.384
(speaking in foreign language)

53:46.324 --> 53:47.223
- Okay.

53:55.299 --> 53:57.333
- You have done very
well, my friend.

53:57.335 --> 53:59.868
Come back and let's celebrate.

54:06.344 --> 54:08.611
(laughing)

54:09.981 --> 54:12.147
(shooting)

54:12.149 --> 54:13.515
(mocking laugh)

54:13.517 --> 54:14.350
- Puto!

54:14.352 --> 54:16.652
(shooting)

54:19.357 --> 54:21.590
- That's for being stupid.

54:24.328 --> 54:25.227
It.

54:26.030 --> 54:26.929
Is.

54:28.065 --> 54:28.964
Done.

54:31.502 --> 54:32.401
On.

54:33.337 --> 54:34.236
The.

54:35.273 --> 54:36.171
Way.

54:43.014 --> 54:45.581
(car revving)

54:49.720 --> 54:53.188
(tense atmosphere music)

55:25.423 --> 55:28.324
(tracker beeping)

55:53.651 --> 55:54.883
What the fuck?

56:19.977 --> 56:23.946
(speaking in foreign language)

56:36.227 --> 56:37.126
- Whoa!

56:38.329 --> 56:39.728
You fucking stink.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.600
That's a crazy infection.

56:45.970 --> 56:48.570
You're gonna have a hard time
getting laid around here.

56:51.842 --> 56:54.476
And if I feel like
you, I would wanna die.

56:57.648 --> 56:57.946
Wait.

57:01.485 --> 57:03.519
Are you waiting for daddy?

57:03.521 --> 57:05.354
Is that what it is?

57:05.356 --> 57:07.089
'Cause see, I have bad news.

57:08.659 --> 57:09.992
He's not coming.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.461
You see, he fucked up.

57:13.531 --> 57:14.963
So we have to take him down.

57:19.437 --> 57:20.335
- Just do it.

57:22.006 --> 57:23.705
- You have suffered too much.

57:23.707 --> 57:25.207
Now you die.

57:25.209 --> 57:27.042
- Stop stop stop stop
stop, don't kill him!

57:27.044 --> 57:28.076
We may still need him alive!

57:28.078 --> 57:30.078
- What are you talking about?

57:30.080 --> 57:32.848
You don't fucking come in
here talking to me like that!

57:32.850 --> 57:34.183
You wanna die too, huh?

57:35.619 --> 57:37.119
- His dad.

57:37.121 --> 57:40.088
I knew I recognized him, but
I just couldn't place it.

57:40.090 --> 57:41.890
He's The Butcher.

57:41.892 --> 57:43.592
He's part of the Cuban Kills.

57:43.594 --> 57:45.227
Responsible for the
Madrid Massacre.

57:45.229 --> 57:46.195
(chuckling)

57:46.197 --> 57:47.896
He's in witness protection.

57:47.898 --> 57:49.565
He's connected.

57:49.567 --> 57:50.466
- No.

57:51.469 --> 57:52.468
He's fucking dead.

57:53.971 --> 57:55.337
- Are you absolutely sure?

57:57.074 --> 58:01.109
(speaking in foreign language)

58:05.149 --> 58:07.249
- [Miguel] Lock him up.

58:07.251 --> 58:11.820
- When my dad gets home, you
guys are in so much shit.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.326
- He's not answering the phone.

58:19.129 --> 58:20.028
- Find me Diego.

58:21.565 --> 58:22.397
Come on!

58:22.399 --> 58:24.066
- He's off grid.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.467
- What about Carlos?

58:26.737 --> 58:27.636
- So is he.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.072
- Fuck.

58:47.925 --> 58:49.291
- It's daddy.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.626
Are you okay?

58:50.628 --> 58:51.527
- Daddy?

58:52.930 --> 58:54.997
Yeah, yeah, we're at
the cabin, we're fine.

58:54.999 --> 58:56.198
Uncle G's--

58:56.200 --> 58:57.032
- Where are you?

58:57.034 --> 58:57.966
What is going on?

58:57.968 --> 58:59.768
I can't get a hold of Jax.

58:59.770 --> 59:01.036
- They took him.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.304
- Who took him?

59:02.306 --> 59:03.572
- Some very bad people.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.308
- What?

59:06.310 --> 59:07.609
What?

59:07.611 --> 59:08.977
What are you gonna do?

59:08.979 --> 59:09.845
What are you gonna do?

59:09.847 --> 59:10.812
- Who took him?

59:10.814 --> 59:11.780
Where's Jax?

59:13.951 --> 59:16.051
- I'm going to get our son back.

59:16.053 --> 59:17.486
- You?

59:17.488 --> 59:19.454
- Yeah, I'm going
to get him now.

59:19.456 --> 59:21.723
- Wait, you're
gonna get him back?

59:21.725 --> 59:22.724
Oh my god.

59:23.827 --> 59:25.160
What?

59:25.162 --> 59:27.162
What are you thinking?

59:27.164 --> 59:28.397
What are you thinking?

59:28.399 --> 59:29.665
No!

59:29.667 --> 59:31.800
- A long time ago,
before you and me,

59:31.802 --> 59:34.770
let's just say things
were very different.

59:35.706 --> 59:36.738
- What are you talking about?

59:36.740 --> 59:37.706
I know everything.

59:37.708 --> 59:39.141
- You need to calm down.

59:39.143 --> 59:40.576
You don't know everything.

59:43.514 --> 59:45.080
- You're gonna bring him home?

59:46.016 --> 59:47.249
- [Stone] Yes.

59:48.485 --> 59:49.952
- Do you promise?

59:51.188 --> 59:52.487
- Yes, I promise you.

59:52.489 --> 59:55.023
And you know how I
am with promises.

59:55.025 --> 59:55.924
- Freely.

59:56.860 --> 59:57.826
- I know baby.

59:57.828 --> 59:58.760
I'm gonna figure this out.

59:58.762 --> 1:00:01.229
It's all connected somehow.

1:00:01.231 --> 1:00:02.531
I gotta go honey.

1:00:02.533 --> 1:00:04.333
Stay there and wait
for us to come home.

1:00:05.436 --> 1:00:07.369
- Are you gonna come home?

1:00:07.371 --> 1:00:08.604
- Daddy's coming home?

1:00:08.606 --> 1:00:09.404
(phone ringing)

1:00:09.406 --> 1:00:10.472
- I wanna come home.

1:00:12.443 --> 1:00:13.942
I wanna be a family again.

1:00:15.012 --> 1:00:16.778
- I want you to be careful.

1:00:20.684 --> 1:00:21.583
I love you.

1:00:23.554 --> 1:00:24.987
Hey, I love you.

1:00:26.190 --> 1:00:27.422
- I love you too, baby.

1:00:30.728 --> 1:00:31.627
- Bye.

1:00:41.605 --> 1:00:42.437
It's okay.

1:00:42.439 --> 1:00:43.739
It's okay.

1:00:43.741 --> 1:00:44.606
It's okay.

1:00:48.078 --> 1:00:49.578
It's gonna be fine.

1:00:49.580 --> 1:00:50.479
Everything's fine.

1:00:53.550 --> 1:00:57.419
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:00:57.421 --> 1:00:59.554
- Baby, you were
amazing upstairs.

1:00:59.556 --> 1:01:02.224
(phone buzzing)

1:01:08.565 --> 1:01:09.731
- Working late?

1:01:09.733 --> 1:01:11.667
- You better be butt dialing me.

1:01:11.669 --> 1:01:13.101
- I missed you too.

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:14.569
Glad to hear your voice.

1:01:14.571 --> 1:01:16.571
Can't believe you still
have the same number.

1:01:16.573 --> 1:01:18.840
- I keep meaning to
change it, you know?

1:01:18.842 --> 1:01:20.442
I thought we had
an understanding.

1:01:20.444 --> 1:01:22.611
- Yup, so you must understand

1:01:22.613 --> 1:01:25.080
the extreme position
I find myself in,

1:01:25.082 --> 1:01:28.450
Mr. Senator, to be
making this call.

1:01:28.452 --> 1:01:29.685
- What do you need Tony?

1:01:29.687 --> 1:01:32.287
- It's Spencer, remember?

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:34.156
I think you even named me.

1:01:34.158 --> 1:01:36.258
- What do you need?

1:01:36.260 --> 1:01:38.093
- I need for our
government to protect

1:01:38.095 --> 1:01:41.096
my son who has been held hostage

1:01:41.098 --> 1:01:44.199
and is a punching bag
to the Matutero Cartel.

1:01:45.836 --> 1:01:47.669
I think I saw something.

1:01:47.671 --> 1:01:48.637
- What?

1:01:48.639 --> 1:01:50.138
You saw what?

1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:51.206
- Don't know.

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:53.875
Military grade weapons.

1:01:55.813 --> 1:01:57.312
Wait.

1:01:57.314 --> 1:01:58.346
You knew about that.

1:01:59.450 --> 1:02:00.482
- I really wish
there was something

1:02:00.484 --> 1:02:01.683
I could do for Jax, but--

1:02:01.685 --> 1:02:04.052
- Come on Ben, we go
back, we go way back.

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:07.155
You used to wet the bed when
you'd come over at night.

1:02:07.157 --> 1:02:09.791
"Benny the Bedwetter."

1:02:09.793 --> 1:02:11.893
I punched that kid in the face.

1:02:12.796 --> 1:02:13.895
That maimed you.

1:02:14.665 --> 1:02:15.797
I broke your nose.

1:02:16.834 --> 1:02:18.233
We were tight.

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:20.102
Come on, I'm in a jam with Jax.

1:02:21.839 --> 1:02:23.538
You were even at the
Christening when he was born.

1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:26.141
- That was a long time ago.

1:02:26.143 --> 1:02:27.676
A long time ago.

1:02:27.678 --> 1:02:29.644
My hands are tied now.

1:02:29.646 --> 1:02:30.846
It's complicated.

1:02:30.848 --> 1:02:32.347
I'm retiring.

1:02:32.349 --> 1:02:34.683
And I really wish there
was something I could do.

1:02:34.685 --> 1:02:37.552
- So that bullet at the
restaurant was for me?

1:02:37.554 --> 1:02:39.588
- Don't ever call here again.

1:02:39.590 --> 1:02:42.023
- Enjoy your
retirement, Senator.

1:02:42.025 --> 1:02:43.225
Although I hear it's tough

1:02:43.227 --> 1:02:45.327
looking over your
shoulder all the time.

1:02:45.329 --> 1:02:47.262
- Hey, did you just threaten me?

1:02:47.264 --> 1:02:49.531
- Oh I most certainly did.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:53.168
I'm coming for you, you
worthless piece of shit!

1:02:53.170 --> 1:02:54.736
You have my word on that!

1:02:55.672 --> 1:02:57.439
- Tony, I was, Tony?

1:02:59.543 --> 1:03:00.842
Fuck!

1:03:00.844 --> 1:03:01.910
Fuck!

1:03:01.912 --> 1:03:02.811
Fuck him.

1:03:05.716 --> 1:03:09.351
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:12.854
(phone ringing)

1:03:15.793 --> 1:03:17.125
(speaking in foreign language)

1:03:17.127 --> 1:03:19.628
- [Stone] Oh did you miss me?

1:03:20.531 --> 1:03:21.797
- Mr. Spencer.

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.766
Or is it Antonio Bandez today?

1:03:25.736 --> 1:03:26.902
(chuckling)

1:03:26.904 --> 1:03:29.471
I guess you were
quite the cook, no?

1:03:30.741 --> 1:03:31.573
- Yup.

1:03:31.575 --> 1:03:32.808
I do like to cook.

1:03:33.744 --> 1:03:34.643
I saw it.

1:03:36.246 --> 1:03:37.913
- You saw what?

1:03:37.915 --> 1:03:39.714
- The weapons.

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:40.715
I saw them.

1:03:42.553 --> 1:03:43.785
- Go on.

1:03:43.787 --> 1:03:45.921
- I'm going to make one offer.

1:03:45.923 --> 1:03:48.223
Exchange me for Jax.

1:03:49.593 --> 1:03:51.059
- And why would I do that?

1:03:51.061 --> 1:03:53.228
- I'll come right now.

1:03:53.230 --> 1:03:55.764
We'll do the
exchange, me for Jax,

1:03:55.766 --> 1:03:57.766
bada bing bada boom.

1:03:57.768 --> 1:03:58.700
It's a done deal.

1:03:59.603 --> 1:04:00.669
- Okay.

1:04:00.671 --> 1:04:02.103
Okay.

1:04:02.105 --> 1:04:04.673
I'm gonna have my best
snipers on your son's head.

1:04:05.776 --> 1:04:07.676
Just in case things
don't go as planned.

1:04:08.579 --> 1:04:10.111
How does that sound?

1:04:10.113 --> 1:04:11.646
- I made a promise.

1:04:11.648 --> 1:04:13.448
And I always keep my promises.

1:04:13.450 --> 1:04:15.784
All I want is my son.

1:04:15.786 --> 1:04:17.786
And I'm on my way.

1:04:17.788 --> 1:04:18.753
- Oh I can't wait.

1:04:20.257 --> 1:04:21.189
Motherfucker.

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:24.359
Go get him.

1:04:24.361 --> 1:04:25.260
Andale.

1:04:39.610 --> 1:04:41.276
- We should have heard
something by now.

1:04:41.278 --> 1:04:42.177
- We will.

1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:44.946
Try to be patient and relax.

1:04:44.948 --> 1:04:46.715
- I don't see why I
can't text anybody.

1:04:46.717 --> 1:04:48.516
- Would you stop it?

1:04:48.518 --> 1:04:50.652
We are all doing the
best we can here.

1:04:50.654 --> 1:04:52.621
- Can we please just go home?

1:04:52.623 --> 1:04:53.955
I'm going crazy here.

1:04:53.957 --> 1:04:55.023
- You're impossible.

1:04:56.960 --> 1:04:58.293
- Relax, honey.

1:04:58.295 --> 1:05:00.061
Everything will be all right.

1:05:00.063 --> 1:05:01.997
- What was my dad like?

1:05:01.999 --> 1:05:03.798
When he was younger.

1:05:05.335 --> 1:05:07.168
- A real spitfire.

1:05:07.170 --> 1:05:08.837
Always has been.

1:05:08.839 --> 1:05:11.239
Your mom had a way of
calming him down though.

1:05:12.142 --> 1:05:14.075
Never seen a man so in love.

1:05:15.178 --> 1:05:17.512
- How come he and Jax
don't talk anymore?

1:05:17.514 --> 1:05:19.748
- You'd have to ask
your mom about that.

1:05:19.750 --> 1:05:21.116
Your father is...

1:05:21.919 --> 1:05:23.385
Complicated.

1:05:23.387 --> 1:05:24.653
He's been through a lot.

1:05:27.057 --> 1:05:28.857
Your dad's a good man though.

1:05:28.859 --> 1:05:30.759
And he loves you very much.

1:05:33.030 --> 1:05:35.931
(tense atmosphere music)

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:39.267
(phone ringing)

1:05:39.269 --> 1:05:40.769
- Hola amigo.

1:05:40.771 --> 1:05:43.838
I'm running out of
fucking patience.

1:05:49.446 --> 1:05:51.346
Do I have your attention now?

1:05:54.251 --> 1:05:58.286
(speaking in foreign language)

1:06:01.892 --> 1:06:04.125
(choking)

1:06:20.377 --> 1:06:23.378
(shooting)

1:06:23.380 --> 1:06:27.482
I told you not to fuck
with me, pinche pendejo!

1:06:27.484 --> 1:06:28.383
Vamanos!

1:06:33.390 --> 1:06:37.325
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

1:06:40.731 --> 1:06:43.064
(phone ringing)

1:06:43.066 --> 1:06:44.265
- Hey.

1:06:44.267 --> 1:06:47.502
I need to talk to
you about something.

1:07:00.150 --> 1:07:02.283
- What have you done?

1:07:02.285 --> 1:07:03.184
Answer me!

1:07:03.186 --> 1:07:04.619
- What's the big deal?

1:07:04.621 --> 1:07:05.787
- What's the big deal?

1:07:05.789 --> 1:07:09.257
I told you your dad
and Jax are in trouble!

1:07:09.259 --> 1:07:11.459
I told you to stay
off social media!

1:07:11.461 --> 1:07:13.495
- How long are we gonna
keep on hiding up here?

1:07:13.497 --> 1:07:14.529
- Sit down!

1:07:16.199 --> 1:07:18.166
- I'm going crazy.

1:07:18.168 --> 1:07:20.301
When are they coming back?

1:07:20.303 --> 1:07:22.137
- What's going on,
what's going on?

1:07:22.139 --> 1:07:23.772
- Probably nothing.

1:07:23.774 --> 1:07:24.672
Don't worry.

1:07:26.643 --> 1:07:27.876
- Come here, right here.

1:07:31.648 --> 1:07:32.814
- Oh it's done.

1:07:32.816 --> 1:07:34.549
- You're done!

1:07:34.551 --> 1:07:35.683
- What?

1:07:35.685 --> 1:07:38.486
- 14 containers left Guatemala.

1:07:38.488 --> 1:07:40.822
13 were delivered
to the compound.

1:07:40.824 --> 1:07:42.223
You do the fucking math!

1:07:43.026 --> 1:07:44.492
- I don't understand.

1:07:44.494 --> 1:07:45.994
How can this be?

1:07:45.996 --> 1:07:48.830
- What it means, mi sobrino,
is that you're in trouble.

1:07:48.832 --> 1:07:51.066
Very huge trouble.

1:07:51.068 --> 1:07:53.501
I believe that you have awoken

1:07:53.503 --> 1:07:56.304
a sleeping giant in
this "Butcher" Antonio.

1:07:56.306 --> 1:07:57.539
I'm told that you brought him

1:07:57.541 --> 1:08:00.341
to the front door
of our operation.

1:08:00.343 --> 1:08:03.645
This is the last time you
bring shame to my family!

1:08:04.981 --> 1:08:07.649
I'm sending Noah in to
clean up your fucking mess!

1:08:08.652 --> 1:08:09.717
Pinche puto!

1:08:11.088 --> 1:08:11.986
- Mateo.

1:08:13.657 --> 1:08:14.556
Fucking traitor.

1:08:15.492 --> 1:08:17.525
You fucking traitor!

1:08:17.527 --> 1:08:19.561
After all I fucking did for you!

1:08:19.563 --> 1:08:20.595
You motherfucker!

1:08:21.865 --> 1:08:22.931
Now you fucking die!

1:08:28.572 --> 1:08:33.108
(classical Italian
atmosphere music)

1:08:48.258 --> 1:08:49.157
- Nice watch.

1:08:50.393 --> 1:08:51.292
- Nice ass.

1:08:52.395 --> 1:08:54.629
I'd like to put a salad
forK on that (mumbles).

1:09:08.712 --> 1:09:10.778
- [Salvie] Hey, minga.

1:09:10.780 --> 1:09:13.681
Marone, what
happened to his hair?

1:09:22.259 --> 1:09:24.392
- No parent should
ever bury a child.

1:09:25.428 --> 1:09:28.997
Josephine, she's
broken up, she can't...

1:09:28.999 --> 1:09:30.899
She wants me to give you this.

1:09:30.901 --> 1:09:32.066
Hey, come on.

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:35.937
This is my sister's son.

1:09:35.939 --> 1:09:37.839
What am I gonna do
with this clown?

1:09:37.841 --> 1:09:38.973
Here.

1:09:38.975 --> 1:09:40.775
She wanted me to give you these.

1:09:40.777 --> 1:09:43.745
Your grandmother prayed
every day with them.

1:09:43.747 --> 1:09:45.847
May it bring you good fortune.

1:09:45.849 --> 1:09:46.781
You're gonna be okay.

1:09:46.783 --> 1:09:47.815
We're here for you.

1:09:47.817 --> 1:09:48.716
Capiche?

1:09:49.586 --> 1:09:51.519
- Thanks for coming, all of you.

1:09:51.521 --> 1:09:52.654
Means a lot to me.

1:09:52.656 --> 1:09:53.688
- What are you
talking about Anthony?

1:09:53.690 --> 1:09:55.290
You're still funny.

1:09:55.292 --> 1:09:56.791
Tua famiglia, huh?

1:09:56.793 --> 1:09:59.494
All right, come on, enough
with the hearts and flowers.

1:09:59.496 --> 1:10:02.130
Let's go wack these
wetback cocksuckers.

1:10:02.132 --> 1:10:03.498
Come on.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:05.300
- Let's wack these
pricks out, let's get it.

1:10:05.302 --> 1:10:06.467
- I'm hungry.

1:10:06.469 --> 1:10:07.635
Can we get something
to eat first?

1:10:07.637 --> 1:10:10.705
(family squabbling)

1:10:14.311 --> 1:10:17.712
(jazzy saxophone music)

1:10:43.006 --> 1:10:44.205
- Wow.

1:10:44.207 --> 1:10:45.974
You are all grown up.

1:10:45.976 --> 1:10:47.408
Very nice.

1:10:47.410 --> 1:10:48.743
- At least one of us has.

1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:52.447
- Look, I have
everything under control.

1:10:53.216 --> 1:10:54.716
And I told your papa.

1:10:54.718 --> 1:10:56.551
- Well apparently you
weren't convincing enough.

1:10:56.553 --> 1:10:59.020
And despite my
reservations, my grandfather

1:10:59.022 --> 1:11:01.256
has invested heavily
in this operation.

1:11:02.592 --> 1:11:05.994
But from here on out, there
will be no more mistakes.

1:11:05.996 --> 1:11:07.662
- Mirame.

1:11:07.664 --> 1:11:09.731
I told them everything was fine.

1:11:09.733 --> 1:11:10.632
But you.

1:11:11.534 --> 1:11:13.268
This is no place for women.

1:11:13.270 --> 1:11:14.168
Entiendes?

1:11:14.170 --> 1:11:15.770
- Si.

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:17.639
But I think I can handle myself.

1:11:18.742 --> 1:11:19.641
- Muy bien.

1:11:22.112 --> 1:11:24.112
- Nice to see you too, cousin.

1:11:28.685 --> 1:11:32.287
("Ave Maria" piano melody)

1:11:40.463 --> 1:11:42.030
- Tastes better
than it looks too.

1:11:42.032 --> 1:11:42.930
- It's good.

1:11:42.932 --> 1:11:44.399
- Okay okay, that should do it.

1:11:44.401 --> 1:11:45.366
- What the hell?

1:11:45.368 --> 1:11:46.601
Ain't we gonna say grace?

1:11:46.603 --> 1:11:48.102
- Fuck grace and the
horse she came in on.

1:11:48.104 --> 1:11:48.970
Mangia.

1:11:52.108 --> 1:11:53.908
Anthony, you outdid yourself.

1:11:53.910 --> 1:11:57.078
You're like the Sicilian
Julia Child, marone.

1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:58.112
- I love to cook.

1:11:58.114 --> 1:11:59.414
It relaxes me.

1:11:59.416 --> 1:12:02.050
Everybody eat, mangia
mangia, come on.

1:12:02.052 --> 1:12:05.219
- Anthony, you embarrass us.

1:12:05.221 --> 1:12:06.721
When we're done
eating, what do you do?

1:12:06.723 --> 1:12:08.890
You turn the vacuum cleaner
on and you do the dishes?

1:12:08.892 --> 1:12:09.791
Is that it, huh?

1:12:09.793 --> 1:12:11.292
(laughing)

1:12:11.294 --> 1:12:13.061
- I think I just came in
my pants, I'm telling you.

1:12:13.063 --> 1:12:14.262
If I could cook like this,

1:12:14.264 --> 1:12:16.097
I wouldn't have to
pay for pussy anymore.

1:12:16.099 --> 1:12:17.332
(laughing)

1:12:17.334 --> 1:12:18.933
- He's never had to
pay for pussy once.

1:12:18.935 --> 1:12:19.767
Not once.

1:12:19.769 --> 1:12:20.601
- [Rocco] That true?

1:12:20.603 --> 1:12:21.436
- Yeah, never.

1:12:21.438 --> 1:12:22.337
Never.

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:23.805
- Broads probably pay him.

1:12:23.807 --> 1:12:26.908
Look at him, he's cut from
Michelangelo, you lucky prick.

1:12:28.178 --> 1:12:29.043
- It's a curse.

1:12:31.081 --> 1:12:32.914
- Hold up, hold up.

1:12:32.916 --> 1:12:34.048
Everybody stop!

1:12:35.952 --> 1:12:37.952
The sauce needs something.

1:12:37.954 --> 1:12:39.654
- Oh Christ, I
thought I was gonna

1:12:39.656 --> 1:12:41.789
have another heart
attack over here.

1:12:41.791 --> 1:12:42.857
- [Rocco] Which one is that?

1:12:42.859 --> 1:12:44.092
- Who the fuck counts?

1:12:44.094 --> 1:12:46.127
My doctor told me I'm
gluten intolerant.

1:12:46.129 --> 1:12:48.463
He told me have soy and
tofu, shit like that.

1:12:48.465 --> 1:12:49.648
- Here's oregano.

1:12:49.649 --> 1:12:50.832
- I told him Doc, go
back to fucking Pakistan.

1:12:50.834 --> 1:12:51.632
Wherever you're from.

1:12:51.634 --> 1:12:52.600
- Amen to that.

1:12:52.602 --> 1:12:53.868
I don't know what
the fuck gluten is,

1:12:53.870 --> 1:12:55.470
but I definitely know I like it.

1:12:55.472 --> 1:12:56.704
- What is this, The
Last Supper over here?

1:12:56.706 --> 1:12:57.572
- I hope not.

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:00.708
At least we all die happy.

1:13:00.710 --> 1:13:02.143
- Nectar from the gods.

1:13:02.145 --> 1:13:03.144
Delicious.

1:13:03.146 --> 1:13:05.880
(clinging glass)

1:13:05.882 --> 1:13:07.515
- I wanna propose a toast.

1:13:08.685 --> 1:13:11.119
To our dear friend
and brother Anthony.

1:13:12.222 --> 1:13:15.289
Through the years when
our so called "friends"

1:13:15.291 --> 1:13:19.560
disappointed us, you
were here for our family.

1:13:19.562 --> 1:13:24.532
You are a man of dignity,
honor, and respect.

1:13:24.534 --> 1:13:28.169
And I vow, with my dying
breath, that I will bring

1:13:28.171 --> 1:13:30.405
to justice those that
have taken your son.

1:13:31.808 --> 1:13:32.907
And there's no
place I'd rather be

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:34.075
than right here with you.

1:13:35.178 --> 1:13:36.811
Except maybe 25 years ago

1:13:36.813 --> 1:13:38.513
when we had that
threesome in Vegas.

1:13:38.515 --> 1:13:40.782
(laughing)

1:13:47.390 --> 1:13:50.158
- You know, I haven't
always been that guy.

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:51.359
I let my temper get in the way

1:13:51.361 --> 1:13:53.227
of my life and fuck things up.

1:13:54.264 --> 1:13:56.564
But there's one thing
my pops, Big Tony,

1:13:56.566 --> 1:14:01.035
God rest his soul,
shoved down my throat.

1:14:01.037 --> 1:14:02.870
I wish he was here with us.

1:14:02.872 --> 1:14:03.971
My word.

1:14:05.442 --> 1:14:06.774
And my word is my bond.

1:14:07.710 --> 1:14:09.710
And I promised Sophie yesterday

1:14:09.712 --> 1:14:11.012
that I would get our son back.

1:14:11.014 --> 1:14:12.780
I gave her my word.

1:14:15.051 --> 1:14:16.517
I'm beyond thankful
to have you guys

1:14:16.519 --> 1:14:19.587
here with me, when
all the others bailed,

1:14:20.690 --> 1:14:22.423
on my promise to
bring back my son.

1:14:26.396 --> 1:14:27.695
To Jax.

1:14:27.697 --> 1:14:29.263
- [Family] To Jax!

1:14:30.867 --> 1:14:32.433
- [Don] May he live forever.

1:14:32.435 --> 1:14:36.437
(speaking in foreign language)

1:14:49.419 --> 1:14:50.585
- Who loves ya, baby?

1:14:50.587 --> 1:14:52.954
(laughing)

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:57.558
- I miss you so much.

1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:00.862
- Which is totally half
as much as I miss you.

1:15:02.065 --> 1:15:04.098
- This place is so lame.

1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:05.833
I wish you could come get me.

1:15:05.835 --> 1:15:09.504
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:15:12.609 --> 1:15:14.342
- Carmen's not in her room.

1:15:14.344 --> 1:15:15.243
Follow me.

1:15:18.014 --> 1:15:20.414
- I'm just a hop, skip,
and an Uber away, my love.

1:15:20.416 --> 1:15:23.684
Or I can rock my skateboard
all the way out there.

1:15:25.088 --> 1:15:25.987
Carmen?

1:15:26.823 --> 1:15:28.256
Carmen, do you have me?

1:15:28.258 --> 1:15:29.957
(shooting)

1:15:29.959 --> 1:15:30.858
Hello?

1:15:33.930 --> 1:15:34.996
- Oh my god!

1:15:34.998 --> 1:15:35.963
It's okay.

1:15:35.965 --> 1:15:37.598
You're okay, you're okay.

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.666
We're okay.

1:15:38.668 --> 1:15:39.800
It'll be okay.

1:15:39.802 --> 1:15:42.036
(weeping)

1:15:53.983 --> 1:15:56.651
(phone ringing)

1:15:56.653 --> 1:15:57.685
- It's Tony.

1:15:58.488 --> 1:15:59.754
I'm here for my son.

1:16:01.224 --> 1:16:03.391
I'm going to take him home
today or I'll die trying.

1:16:06.162 --> 1:16:07.061
- Okay.

1:16:08.665 --> 1:16:10.197
I see.

1:16:10.199 --> 1:16:12.199
But we tried that yesterday.

1:16:13.670 --> 1:16:17.471
And from what I remember,
it didn't work out for you.

1:16:17.473 --> 1:16:18.806
- It's a new day.

1:16:18.808 --> 1:16:20.141
- Muy bien.

1:16:20.143 --> 1:16:22.076
I was wondering if
you would call me.

1:16:23.980 --> 1:16:28.149
Quite frankly, I was
beginning to worry about you.

1:16:29.018 --> 1:16:30.017
- You should be worried.

1:16:30.019 --> 1:16:31.419
Very worried.

1:16:31.421 --> 1:16:32.987
I'm coming for you.

1:16:32.989 --> 1:16:34.922
You have my word on
that as a Catholic.

1:16:34.924 --> 1:16:36.524
- Oh I see.

1:16:36.526 --> 1:16:39.060
So you're gonna take
down this whole compound.

1:16:39.062 --> 1:16:41.696
You're gonna take down this
whole compound by yourself!

1:16:41.698 --> 1:16:43.598
Is that what you're telling me?

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:44.832
Huh?

1:16:44.834 --> 1:16:46.334
- Nah.

1:16:46.336 --> 1:16:47.668
Brought a few of the old buddies

1:16:47.670 --> 1:16:49.236
from the neighborhood with me.

1:16:50.373 --> 1:16:52.740
Now it's personal.

1:16:58.214 --> 1:16:59.113
- Vamanos!

1:17:02.885 --> 1:17:06.354
(tense atmosphere music)

1:17:24.407 --> 1:17:25.740
- Rocco!

1:17:25.742 --> 1:17:26.641
Rocco, come here.

1:17:27.744 --> 1:17:29.043
Come get us when it's finished.

1:17:29.045 --> 1:17:30.077
- [Rocco] We got you, boss.

1:17:30.079 --> 1:17:31.979
- Salvie, go wait in the car.

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:33.748
Jesus, it's hot out here.

1:17:33.750 --> 1:17:34.949
You're killing me.

1:17:34.951 --> 1:17:37.885
- Let's go wack
these cocksuckers.

1:17:37.887 --> 1:17:38.786
- All right.

1:17:42.392 --> 1:17:44.458
Come on, I wanna
talk to you guys.

1:17:44.460 --> 1:17:46.260
I just wanna thank you
guys for coming out here.

1:17:46.262 --> 1:17:47.428
It means a lot to me.

1:17:47.430 --> 1:17:48.929
And I just wanted to say--

1:17:48.931 --> 1:17:50.398
- Sorry I'm late.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:52.600
Heard about the big fight.

1:17:52.602 --> 1:17:53.434
- Where?

1:17:53.436 --> 1:17:54.402
- It was on Twitter.

1:17:54.404 --> 1:17:56.737
No, it was on fucking Facebook.

1:17:56.739 --> 1:17:58.639
No, never mind, I
can't quite remember.

1:17:58.641 --> 1:17:59.974
I was pretty drunk.

1:17:59.976 --> 1:18:01.676
Anyway, fuck it.

1:18:02.578 --> 1:18:04.412
I'm not Italian, but I'm trying.

1:18:04.414 --> 1:18:05.680
I just love your food.

1:18:05.682 --> 1:18:06.981
And you bet your fucking ass

1:18:06.983 --> 1:18:08.349
I'm ready to blow shit up.

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:12.353
- Where'd he come from?

1:18:12.355 --> 1:18:13.988
(laughing)

1:18:13.990 --> 1:18:16.524
(clearing throat)

1:18:16.526 --> 1:18:19.827
Martin Luther King Jr
said it's not where a man

1:18:19.829 --> 1:18:23.831
stands in a moment of
comfort and confidence.

1:18:23.833 --> 1:18:26.634
But it's where a man stands--

1:18:26.636 --> 1:18:28.936
(shooting)

1:18:31.174 --> 1:18:32.406
What the fuck?

1:18:35.511 --> 1:18:37.311
(reloading)

1:18:37.313 --> 1:18:40.381
(epic action music)

1:18:43.953 --> 1:18:46.220
(shooting)

1:19:33.736 --> 1:19:36.203
(laughing)

1:19:36.205 --> 1:19:38.572
(shooting)

1:19:49.051 --> 1:19:52.086
- Who in their right fucking
mind would wanna live out here?

1:19:52.088 --> 1:19:53.721
- Nah, it's okay out here.

1:19:53.723 --> 1:19:56.557
You gotta come out
for the six months.

1:19:56.559 --> 1:19:58.559
- If you're a camel maybe.

1:19:58.561 --> 1:20:00.194
- Not a camel, you gotta
put up with that bullshit

1:20:00.196 --> 1:20:01.629
back east with the
snow and the rain.

1:20:01.631 --> 1:20:04.031
- Yeah, but come on.
- This is nice out.

1:20:04.033 --> 1:20:06.300
(shooting)

1:20:16.245 --> 1:20:17.077
- Sniper!

1:20:17.079 --> 1:20:18.412
Watch the roof!

1:20:18.414 --> 1:20:20.781
(shooting)

1:20:28.457 --> 1:20:31.659
(music intensifying)

1:20:47.176 --> 1:20:48.609
- Fuck that.

1:20:48.611 --> 1:20:51.278
(shooting)

1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:53.647
- Anyway, you see
Jeopardy last night?

1:20:53.649 --> 1:20:54.615
- I saw Jeopardy.

1:20:54.617 --> 1:20:55.916
- You watch fucking Jeopardy?

1:20:55.918 --> 1:20:57.117
- Yeah, I watched
Jeopardy, yeah yeah.

1:20:57.119 --> 1:20:58.419
- I couldn't believe
a schoolteacher,

1:20:58.421 --> 1:20:59.653
she couldn't answer
a simple question.

1:20:59.655 --> 1:21:01.355
The seven fucking
New England states.

1:21:01.357 --> 1:21:02.790
- Can you name the seven
New England states?

1:21:02.792 --> 1:21:04.358
- Of course I can name them.

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:05.926
- Well go ahead and name them.

1:21:05.928 --> 1:21:06.944
You lost already.

1:21:06.945 --> 1:21:07.961
- All right, well
give me a second.

1:21:07.964 --> 1:21:09.296
Give me a second.

1:21:09.298 --> 1:21:11.665
(shooting)

1:21:15.605 --> 1:21:18.672
(epic action music)

1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:25.646
- Fuck you!

1:21:25.648 --> 1:21:27.948
(shooting)

1:21:40.663 --> 1:21:43.397
- Come and get it, motherfucker!

1:21:57.680 --> 1:21:59.346
(groaning)

1:21:59.348 --> 1:22:00.214
- Fuck!

1:22:02.084 --> 1:22:03.918
- You know what to do when
you hear a rattlesnake?

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:04.752
You see that?

1:22:04.754 --> 1:22:05.719
- Yeah?

1:22:05.721 --> 1:22:06.921
- You stand still,
you don't move.

1:22:06.923 --> 1:22:07.955
I know you, you're gonna move.

1:22:08.824 --> 1:22:09.823
- You don't know.

1:22:09.825 --> 1:22:11.692
Oh look at this, how convenient.

1:22:11.694 --> 1:22:13.928
- Take care of that, take care
of that, take care of that.

1:22:13.930 --> 1:22:15.029
(shooting)

1:22:15.031 --> 1:22:16.363
- (mumbles) you cocksucker.

1:22:16.365 --> 1:22:17.331
- He down?

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:18.832
- Yeah, he's down for the count.

1:22:18.834 --> 1:22:20.067
- He moving?

1:22:20.069 --> 1:22:21.368
- What's taking these
other pricks so long?

1:22:21.370 --> 1:22:22.937
(epic action music)

1:22:22.939 --> 1:22:25.272
(shooting)

1:22:28.344 --> 1:22:29.810
- Hola, mi amiga.

1:22:34.350 --> 1:22:35.716
(shooting)

1:22:35.718 --> 1:22:37.051
Hashtag Me Too.

1:22:37.053 --> 1:22:39.119
Hashtag fuck you, bitch.

1:22:42.191 --> 1:22:43.590
Tony, all clear!

1:23:23.599 --> 1:23:26.467
(tense atmosphere music)

1:23:26.469 --> 1:23:28.802
(grunting)

1:23:34.410 --> 1:23:37.144
(neck snapping)

1:23:52.928 --> 1:23:54.595
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:23:54.597 --> 1:23:55.829
He's gone.

1:23:55.831 --> 1:23:57.464
Enough.

1:23:57.466 --> 1:23:58.966
Let him go.

1:23:58.968 --> 1:23:59.967
Calm down, enough.

1:23:59.969 --> 1:24:00.968
- Come on, Anthony.

1:24:00.970 --> 1:24:02.469
- Come on, come on, let it go.

1:24:02.471 --> 1:24:03.604
Let it go, come on.

1:24:03.606 --> 1:24:05.139
- I just wanna see my boy.

1:24:05.141 --> 1:24:06.173
- I know, I know, come on.

1:24:06.175 --> 1:24:07.641
- I just wanna talk to my son.

1:24:07.643 --> 1:24:08.709
- Come on come on come on.

1:24:08.711 --> 1:24:10.144
- I didn't get a
chance to tell him.

1:24:10.146 --> 1:24:10.944
- Come on come on.

1:24:10.946 --> 1:24:12.146
Come on, we're done here.

1:24:12.148 --> 1:24:13.347
Come on, let's go.

1:24:13.349 --> 1:24:14.782
Let's go, let's go.

1:24:14.784 --> 1:24:15.682
Listen to me.

1:24:15.684 --> 1:24:17.017
Listen, he's gone all right?

1:24:17.019 --> 1:24:18.986
You've been a good father.

1:24:18.988 --> 1:24:20.721
You did the best
you could, okay?

1:24:21.791 --> 1:24:22.990
- Where's Salvie?

1:24:22.992 --> 1:24:23.824
He still there?

1:24:23.826 --> 1:24:25.826
- Salvie didn't make it.

1:24:25.828 --> 1:24:28.128
He's got cancer and this
is the way he wanted to go.

1:24:28.130 --> 1:24:30.964
He didn't wanna die in a
hospital with tubes up his ass.

1:24:31.867 --> 1:24:34.034
Look how beautiful all this is.

1:24:34.036 --> 1:24:35.803
We made Salvie's day, all right?

1:24:35.805 --> 1:24:37.905
We blew the shit out
of all these Mexicans.

1:24:37.907 --> 1:24:39.373
Capiche?

1:24:39.375 --> 1:24:40.340
Huh?

1:24:40.342 --> 1:24:42.076
Right fellas, didn't we?

1:24:42.078 --> 1:24:42.910
Okay.

1:24:42.912 --> 1:24:43.811
Where you going?

1:24:43.813 --> 1:24:44.678
Where you going?

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:46.146
- I gotta take care
of a few things.

1:24:46.148 --> 1:24:47.147
- No no no no.

1:24:47.149 --> 1:24:48.382
- I'll catch up
with you guys later.

1:24:48.384 --> 1:24:49.650
- Rocco, go after
him, go after him.

1:24:49.652 --> 1:24:50.751
- No no no no, it's okay.

1:24:50.753 --> 1:24:52.186
I gotta take care
of some things.

1:24:52.188 --> 1:24:53.353
Don't friggin' worry about it.

1:24:53.355 --> 1:24:54.922
- All right, come here Rocco.

1:24:54.924 --> 1:24:55.789
He's good.

1:24:57.026 --> 1:24:58.258
Let him go, let him go.

1:25:00.830 --> 1:25:04.264
(tense atmosphere music)

1:25:22.251 --> 1:25:24.118
- Cocksucking senator.

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:25.285
Cheating on his wife?

1:25:26.055 --> 1:25:28.789
I should kill that fucking slut.

1:25:32.895 --> 1:25:34.428
- Here's to early retirement.

1:25:34.430 --> 1:25:35.496
- Hell yeah.

1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:46.473
(laughing)

1:25:47.910 --> 1:25:50.144
- [Ben] God bless America.

1:25:56.752 --> 1:25:58.485
- Die, motherfucker.

1:26:05.594 --> 1:26:09.329
(dramatic atmosphere music)

1:26:22.178 --> 1:26:24.244
(knocking)

1:26:24.246 --> 1:26:25.846
It's open, come in!

1:26:39.128 --> 1:26:42.429
You didn't have to knock,
this is still your home too.

1:26:42.431 --> 1:26:44.765
- I never really
felt at home here.

1:26:44.767 --> 1:26:46.166
Where's my package?

1:26:46.168 --> 1:26:47.401
- Relax, Jax.

1:26:49.338 --> 1:26:50.938
- Don't tell me to relax.

1:26:50.940 --> 1:26:53.006
Try to order me around like
one of your fucking goons.

1:26:53.008 --> 1:26:54.541
- Hey keep your tone done.

1:26:54.543 --> 1:26:56.743
Respect me, I'm still
your frickin' father.

1:26:58.147 --> 1:26:59.179
- Respect?

1:27:00.449 --> 1:27:01.248
For you?

1:27:02.685 --> 1:27:03.984
You kidding me?

1:27:03.986 --> 1:27:06.320
- I know we don't
see eye to eye.

1:27:06.322 --> 1:27:08.722
How about you do
you and I'll do me?

1:27:10.226 --> 1:27:11.124
- Yeah.

1:27:12.461 --> 1:27:14.561
God only knows what
you've done in your past.

1:27:15.965 --> 1:27:17.231
I don't even wanna know.

1:27:18.834 --> 1:27:21.068
Even though I have
access to your Triple I.

1:27:24.573 --> 1:27:27.975
- What are you gonna
do, use that on me?

1:27:29.712 --> 1:27:32.112
- I don't even know why I
pretend to care about you.

1:27:33.082 --> 1:27:33.981
'Cause I don't.

1:27:36.752 --> 1:27:38.986
I'm only here 'cause you and
mom are getting a divorce.

1:27:38.988 --> 1:27:40.687
- Look, I still love her.

1:27:40.689 --> 1:27:42.489
I just don't get along
with your mother.

1:27:42.491 --> 1:27:43.824
- Don't give me that shit.

1:27:46.495 --> 1:27:48.362
I'm just here to
pick up a package.

1:27:48.364 --> 1:27:49.997
- I know you're not proud of me,

1:27:49.999 --> 1:27:52.266
but believe it or
not, I'm proud of you.

1:27:53.369 --> 1:27:54.801
- You got nothing
to be proud of.

1:27:56.605 --> 1:27:58.605
We deserve better,
mom deserves better.

1:28:01.076 --> 1:28:02.809
I honestly hope...

1:28:04.580 --> 1:28:06.780
That this is the last
time I ever see you.

1:28:09.051 --> 1:28:10.484
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1:28:11.553 --> 1:28:12.452
Kids today.

1:28:31.307 --> 1:28:34.641
(dramatic piano music)

1:28:37.446 --> 1:28:40.080
- And so it is
appropriate that we are

1:28:40.082 --> 1:28:43.483
gathered here today for
the celebration of life.

1:28:43.485 --> 1:28:45.852
For Jax so dearly
loved the desert.

1:28:47.256 --> 1:28:52.326
And as Jax moves on, it
is we who are left behind.

1:28:53.095 --> 1:28:54.494
We are the unfortunate ones.

1:28:55.764 --> 1:28:57.998
Let us celebrate each day.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:28:59.132
And each other.

1:29:00.135 --> 1:29:01.668
For we will all be met again.

1:29:06.241 --> 1:29:08.342
My sincerest condolences.

1:29:40.542 --> 1:29:43.877
(epic orchestra music)
