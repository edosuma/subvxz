00:04.375 --> 00:06.250
You will not believe the conversation
I just overheard

00:06.375 --> 00:07.667
between Gabe and his friend Jake.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.417
So you were snooping.

00:13.166 --> 00:14.333
I wasn't snooping.

00:15.166 --> 00:17.875
I was tiptoeing down the stairs

00:18.000 --> 00:20.250
when I paused for a break.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.041
Uh-huh, go on, snoopy.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.834
Okay, so anyway,

00:26.917 --> 00:29.250
Gabe says, "Heather is so hot."

00:29.333 --> 00:31.208
And Jake's all, "So hot!"

00:32.750 --> 00:33.750
And then Gabe says,

00:33.834 --> 00:36.208
"I really like her,
but I'm too nervous to talk to her."

00:36.291 --> 00:37.125
And Jake's all,

00:37.208 --> 00:40.125
"Dude, you gotta hike up your skirt
and ask her out."

00:42.291 --> 00:43.667
Bob, what are we gonna do about this?

00:44.333 --> 00:46.792
How about we make you wear a bell
so the kids can hear you coming?

00:49.625 --> 00:52.250
I'm talking about Gabe
being too shy to talk to girls.

00:52.375 --> 00:55.250
Once again, mama Ames
has to solve the problem.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.250
Ooh, snooping and meddling.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.542
Mama Ames is on fire today.

01:00.917 --> 01:03.333
You know what?
I think I got a bell in the garage.

01:06.458 --> 01:07.583
What you got there, kiddo?

01:07.667 --> 01:09.750
Oh, I'm just going through
my old school photos.

01:09.834 --> 01:11.625
We're getting our pictures
taken in a couple of days

01:11.709 --> 01:14.083
and I am determined, for once,
to not look like a dork.

01:14.166 --> 01:15.417
What's wrong with your pictures?

01:15.500 --> 01:17.750
Well, let's stroll down
memory lane, shall we?

01:18.417 --> 01:19.667
Here I am in kindergarten.

01:21.959 --> 01:24.792
Yeah, that was the day
we learned about static electricity.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.041
I just finished rubbing my head
with a balloon.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.750
Well, honey, they can't all be that bad.

01:30.834 --> 01:31.959
Oh, can't they?

01:32.041 --> 01:33.667
Here I am again, third grade.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.250
That was the morning that baby Gabe
threw a sippy cup at me.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.709
Baby Gabe, such a little terror.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.166
- And we thought it was just a phase.
- Yeah.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.375
Hey, Mom, how can I make sure
that I take a good picture?

01:49.458 --> 01:51.041
Oh, do what I do when I wanna look good.

01:51.125 --> 01:52.250
Go buy a new outfit.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.417
Well, would you, uh...

01:57.000 --> 01:58.250
Would you pay for this new outfit?

01:58.917 --> 02:01.583

Oh, this show is so funny.
What's it called?

03:04.792 --> 03:07.500
"The Gurgles."
It's our favorite show, right, Charlie?

03:10.750 --> 03:11.959
Well, it's my favorite show.

03:15.458 --> 03:17.375
Oh, um, I'd better go,

03:17.792 --> 03:20.291
but first, I want a picture of you and me.

03:20.542 --> 03:21.667
Oh, can it wait till tomorrow?

03:21.750 --> 03:23.208
It'll give me a chance to trim my beard.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.041
Beard?

03:25.417 --> 03:26.542
I don't see anything.

03:26.625 --> 03:27.625
Really?

03:27.709 --> 03:29.291
I've been growing it out
for, like, a month.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.125
Well, I really need a picture now.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.375
All right. Uh...

03:33.375 --> 03:35.417
Well, nobody else is home, so, uh...

03:35.500 --> 03:37.083
Charlie will have to take it. Okay.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.625
Charlie, come here for a second.

03:38.709 --> 03:41.000
This is very easy. Very easy, okay.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.500
You're gonna push this little button
halfway down to focus.

03:43.583 --> 03:46.000
Then when the green light
goes from flashing to solid,

03:46.083 --> 03:48.625
push it all the way down
until you hear the click.

03:48.709 --> 03:49.542
Okay?

03:50.917 --> 03:51.750
Okay?

03:54.917 --> 03:56.083
Or we can just take it ourselves.

03:58.792 --> 04:00.709
Ready? Smile.

04:02.041 --> 04:02.875
- Let's see.
- Right.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.458
- Aw.
- Oh.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.166
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.041
Well, uh, I'd better go.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.375
- There you go.
- Thanks.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.375
Goodbye, PJ.

04:16.417 --> 04:18.792
Oh, whoa, hey.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.500
Uh, are you okay?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.250
I'm fine. It's, uh, it's just that...

04:25.917 --> 04:26.875
I'm fine.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.834
Okay. See you tomorrow?

04:31.083 --> 04:31.959
Bye.

04:36.875 --> 04:37.709
That was weird.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.000
Oh, man, this thing is driving me crazy.
I gotta go shave.

04:53.750 --> 04:54.875
Spencer?

04:55.959 --> 04:56.834
Teddy, hi.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.625
Hey, you're rockin' those flips.

05:01.750 --> 05:02.917
What are you doing here?

05:03.583 --> 05:04.709
Without a shirt?

05:06.917 --> 05:07.959
Oh, I, uh...

05:08.041 --> 05:09.250
I work here.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.166
- Oh.
- Hang on. Yeah, I'm open.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.667
Nice toss, brah.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.625
So... so this is work?

05:17.083 --> 05:18.625
Yeah, I'm an in-store model.

05:18.834 --> 05:21.625
It's all part of selling
the, uh, hot teen summer lifestyle.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.333
Hey, those shades are tight.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.792
So you just... You stand here
and you act dumb?

05:28.875 --> 05:30.125
Is...

05:30.208 --> 05:32.375
That's the stupidest job
I've ever heard of.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.041
Well, I get a huge discount
on all the clothes.

05:36.125 --> 05:37.750
Oh, I want a stupid job too.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.250
- I guess I could get you an interview.
- Okay.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.917
Hey, righteous board shorts, dude.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.875
And they won't set you back
too much cheddar.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.125
Yeah, that's right. Lookin' gouda.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.166
Gouda?

05:50.792 --> 05:53.250
I... I thought we were doing
a cheese thing.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.083
Skyler's: Dear PJ,

06:05.250 --> 06:07.709
I have something to tell you,
so I'm writing this note.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.959
But since you're not a big reader,
I taped it for you instead.

06:11.542 --> 06:14.125
There's a boom box on the bench.
Hit "play."

06:19.959 --> 06:21.917
Skyler on recording:
So this is kinda hard.

06:22.417 --> 06:25.625
I have to tell you, um, that...

06:28.041 --> 06:30.667
I... I'm sorry. I can't go on.
Just go back to the note.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.667
Skyler: I've got some really bad news.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.750
My dad has been transferred
to New York City,

06:39.834 --> 06:41.375
which means I'm moving there.

06:42.917 --> 06:45.875
I wanted to tell you,
but it made me so sad to say goodbye,

06:45.959 --> 06:46.834
I just couldn't.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.792
I'll miss you forever.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.166
Oh, by the way, this is Skyler.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.333
Now press "play" again.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.458
What's going on?

07:18.166 --> 07:19.041
Here.

07:19.667 --> 07:20.542
Read that.

07:26.667 --> 07:29.375
PJ, I'm so sorry.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.041
Dad, she...

07:31.125 --> 07:32.417
She was the love of my life.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.291
I mean, I'll never be happy again.

07:34.375 --> 07:35.792
Okay, I know it feels that way now...

07:35.875 --> 07:37.166
No, I'll never be happy again.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.583
- PJ, in time...
- No, never!

07:38.709 --> 07:41.125
Okay, fine. All right, all right,
you're never gonna be happy again.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.458
How can you say that?

07:50.750 --> 07:53.000
Oh, what you doing?

07:53.458 --> 07:54.417
Having a snack.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.083
Can I help you with something?

08:07.709 --> 08:10.875
Nope, just making convo with my boy.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.083
Or should I say young man?

08:16.041 --> 08:17.291
- Yeah, I'm out of here.
- Nope.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.291
Sit in that chair.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.250
Let's talk about school.

08:24.083 --> 08:24.959
Okay.

08:25.458 --> 08:26.583
How are your classmates?

08:27.375 --> 08:28.250
My classmates?

08:28.625 --> 08:31.959
Boy classmates, girl classmates...

08:32.208 --> 08:33.208
Heather.

08:35.417 --> 08:37.542
Heather? Wait, how'd you know about her?

08:37.834 --> 08:39.083
Your dad is such a snoop.

08:40.834 --> 08:43.792
Anyway, if you ever wanna talk about her,
I'm here for you.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.208
No, we are never having that conversation.

08:48.125 --> 08:51.000
Gabe, I'm a girl. I know what girls like.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.417
Honey, I just want you
to have the right information.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.083
Mom, if I need information about girls,

08:56.166 --> 08:57.792
I'll get it
where all 12-year-olds get it...

08:58.166 --> 08:59.583
From a 13-year-old.

09:04.375 --> 09:05.458
How cute.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.208
He thinks this is over.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.375
Okay, just remember, try and be...

09:15.458 --> 09:16.875
- Not smart. Right, got it.
- Yeah, okay.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.750
Teddy, uh, this is my manager Rain.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.834
Oh, rain. I love it.

09:22.917 --> 09:25.542
It's like so... wet.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.250
So you two go to school together?

09:30.333 --> 09:32.291
Yeah, that's right.
We're... we're school buds.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.667
I mean, when I bother to show up.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.125
And how are your grades?

09:38.375 --> 09:40.208
Oh, not good, mostly Cs...

09:41.500 --> 09:44.291
and Ds, Ds, mostly Ds.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.792
I like this girl.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.875
So what do you like
to do in your free time?

09:48.250 --> 09:50.041
I like to...

09:50.125 --> 09:51.417
hug myself?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.542
No.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.959
I like to chill. Chill! I like to chill.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.458
Cool.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.625
Okay, let's see how you do
with a beach ball.

10:00.417 --> 10:01.959
Yeah, you're just gonna wanna... Okay.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.333
What was that?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.834
If you're gonna work here,

10:11.917 --> 10:15.375
you have to make me believe
that you love catching beach balls.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.083
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay. Again.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.083
Teddy: All right

10:23.291 --> 10:24.583
It's fun.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.542
I think you could be
hot teen summer material...

10:27.625 --> 10:29.291
Awesome, stoked.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.250
...if you do something
about that pale skin.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.500
Sorry, what?

10:33.834 --> 10:36.417
You have to look like you live in the sun.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.041
At HTS...

10:38.125 --> 10:40.458
- The sun is your daddy.
- Mm-hmm.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.834
So come back tomorrow at four,

10:43.917 --> 10:45.667
if you have a tan, you've got a job.

10:45.750 --> 10:46.917
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.458
What am I supposed to do?
I burn too easily in the sun.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.375
Do what we all do, get some bronzer.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.166
A spray-on tan. I can do that.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.375
- Thanks.
- Yep.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.792
Well, I should probably get going.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.709
You know we have
that big physics test tomorrow.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.083
Would you keep your voice down?
Do you wanna get us all fired?

11:02.166 --> 11:03.625
Oh sorry.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.333
Hey.

11:10.959 --> 11:12.375
Look what I found on the porch.

11:14.375 --> 11:15.834
"Dear Duncan family,

11:15.917 --> 11:17.333
I wrote you this note,

11:17.417 --> 11:19.750
then decided
you should hear it from me instead.

11:19.834 --> 11:20.792
Press 'play.'"

11:22.792 --> 11:24.792
PJ on recording: Hey, guys, uh...

11:25.041 --> 11:28.083
so I decided to follow Skyler to New York
so we can be together.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.333
Skyler's parents said
I could stay with them

11:31.417 --> 11:32.625
until I land on my feet.

11:32.709 --> 11:34.000
So...

11:35.250 --> 11:38.208
thanks for being a great family
and don't worry about me.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.458
Love you.

11:40.625 --> 11:41.875
Oh, by the way, this is PJ.

11:45.125 --> 11:46.000
Hmm...

11:46.458 --> 11:49.166
Looks like somebody talked
to the wrong son about girls.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.041
Hey, Charlie, it's Daddy.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.583
I'm calling you from New York City.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.500
Can you put Mommy on the phone?

12:06.667 --> 12:07.750
Put Mommy on the phone.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.000
Can you put...

12:10.083 --> 12:11.208
Put Mommy on the phone.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.250
Or just hang up.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.458
Oh. Pizza's here!

12:22.333 --> 12:25.125
Skyler, it's me. It's PJ's dad.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.917
Oh, this is awkward.
We only ordered a medium.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.458
Actually, I'm... I'm just looking for PJ.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.375
Oh, PJ.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.709
Can you believe he came
all this way for me?

12:37.792 --> 12:39.875
It's so romantic.

12:39.959 --> 12:40.875
Ah.

12:41.250 --> 12:44.875
So did you see a pizza delivery guy
on your way up?

12:47.041 --> 12:47.959
So where is he?

12:48.041 --> 12:50.875
I don't know.
I just asked you where he is.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.583
PJ, honey. Where's PJ?

12:55.417 --> 12:56.959
Oh!

12:57.041 --> 12:59.458
- He's at work.
- He got a job already?

12:59.542 --> 13:02.208
Yeah, he wants to make money
to get his own apartment.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.792
He's working on Wall Street.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.125
He's working on Wall Street?

13:06.375 --> 13:09.000
Well, under Wall Street.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.375
All right. "Keep bronzer on for one hour.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.625
Then rinse and enjoy your golden tan."

13:42.083 --> 13:43.083
Sounds simple enough.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.750
Okay, so...

13:47.166 --> 13:48.250
One hour.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.542
Now I just have to wait for the ding.

14:06.667 --> 14:07.834
What time is it?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.333
Three o'clock.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.709
By the way, you're orange.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.709
Yeah, I know I'm orange.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.125
Why didn't the timer go off?

14:19.583 --> 14:22.500
Charlie, what did you do?

14:24.125 --> 14:27.458
Relax, someday you'll laugh about this.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.375
I'm gonna laugh about it today.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.583
Oh my gosh, I can't believe
I, Heather grouper,

14:39.667 --> 14:41.208
am in Gabe Duncan's house.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.417
I didn't think he even knew I existed.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.000
Well, obviously I exist

14:45.083 --> 14:47.417
or I wouldn't be here
in Gabe Duncan's house,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.583
which is so much bigger than I thought.

14:49.917 --> 14:51.458
Isn't it so funny how some houses

14:51.542 --> 14:53.583
look so small from the outside,
but are big on the inside?

14:53.667 --> 14:56.333
And other houses look big on the outside,
but are small on the inside?

14:58.041 --> 15:00.709
Well, anyway, what was the question again?

15:02.375 --> 15:03.250
How are you?

15:05.458 --> 15:06.291
Good.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.166
Great actually,
because I'm in Gabe Duncan's house!

15:09.250 --> 15:11.458
- It's just so much bigger...
- Yeah, we got that. We got that.

15:12.125 --> 15:12.959
Heather: Gabe!

15:15.417 --> 15:16.542
What are you doing here?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.000
Your mom invited me.

15:18.792 --> 15:19.917
She said you like me.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.875
Mom, a word in the kitchen?

15:28.583 --> 15:29.750
Okay.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.875
Be right back.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.625
Why did you tell annoying Heather
I like her?

15:40.667 --> 15:42.750
Because I know my little boy is too shy...

15:43.458 --> 15:44.709
I'm sorry.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.709
Why did you call her "annoying Heather"?

15:48.750 --> 15:50.917
I don't like her. I like hot Heather.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.291
There's two heathers?

15:54.625 --> 15:56.417
In my class, there are five Heathers.

15:57.041 --> 16:00.208
And I would have been okay
with any of the others...

16:00.291 --> 16:02.125
Smart Heather, tall Heather,

16:02.208 --> 16:03.625
even hairy Heather.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.041
Boy...

16:08.500 --> 16:11.208

you hadn't gotten me involved in this.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.166
Hey! Dad, what are you doing here?

16:31.625 --> 16:32.625
We need to talk.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.667
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.417
Hey, get lost, mimey.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.875
This is my territory.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.041
Go on, hit the imaginary road.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.542
- Get outta here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, PJ!

16:49.041 --> 16:50.583
What happened to you?

16:50.667 --> 16:51.917
Been in New York a day and a half.

16:52.458 --> 16:53.875
The city changes you, man.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.500
Okay, you need to come home.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.875
No, no, Skyler and I belong together.

16:59.959 --> 17:01.542
I know how you feel,

17:02.291 --> 17:05.625
but look at the size of that cockroach!

17:07.333 --> 17:09.542
Skyler is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.208
We're meant to be together.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.583
PJ, you're 17 years old.

17:13.959 --> 17:15.375
How can you possibly know that?

17:15.458 --> 17:17.542
Well, all I know is
I don't wanna be apart from her.

17:18.291 --> 17:19.792
You might not be apart forever.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.291
What do you mean?

17:21.375 --> 17:23.375
When it comes to love,
there's a very old saying...

17:24.041 --> 17:26.750
Sweet mama, that's a giant rat!

17:27.875 --> 17:29.333
Yeah, I've heard that before, but...

17:29.417 --> 17:31.041
No, no, no, that's...
that's not the saying.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.834
The saying is...

17:34.041 --> 17:36.959
Son, if you love something, set it free.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.208
If it comes back to you, then it's yours.

17:40.542 --> 17:43.291
But if it doesn't, then it never was.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.625
What happened to you?

17:55.959 --> 17:58.959
I may have overbronzed just a smidge.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.458
I didn't think you'd pull off
the whole dumb thing,

18:03.542 --> 18:05.083
but it turns out you're a natural.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.583
- Teddy?
- Oh hi, boss.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.083
Hey, why don't you toss me
that beach ball, dude?

18:15.959 --> 18:17.583
Whoo!

18:17.667 --> 18:19.166
Yeah!

18:20.250 --> 18:21.417
Why are you orange?

18:21.875 --> 18:24.041
See, it's just a healthy glow.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.166
Hey, brother, why don't
you throw me that football?

18:28.792 --> 18:29.709
Oh!

18:31.250 --> 18:32.625
- Ow.
- Are you okay?

18:32.709 --> 18:34.750
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm fine.

18:34.917 --> 18:37.250
Hey, righteous beach towel, dude.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.166
Could I use it to wipe up some blood?

18:54.208 --> 18:57.000
Mom, what are we gonna do?
We can't hide in the kitchen forever.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.125
Why not?

18:58.417 --> 18:59.875
We've got food. We've got drink.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.709
Mom, you gotta get rid of her.

19:05.083 --> 19:07.583
This is really hard.
I've never broken up with a girl before.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.166
- Fine, I'll do it myself.
- Gabe, no.

19:12.709 --> 19:14.417
Heather, I gotta tell you something.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.458
Yes, Gabe?

19:17.291 --> 19:19.250
Mom, something you wanna say?

19:20.917 --> 19:24.291
Okay. Heather, the thing is...

19:24.542 --> 19:28.000
um, there was a little mix-up
about the who likes who thing.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.667
Oh no! Gabe doesn't like me?

19:30.750 --> 19:32.375
Only... Only because...

19:33.834 --> 19:35.000
Jake likes you.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.500
Which Jake?

19:38.125 --> 19:39.041
How many are there?

19:39.709 --> 19:42.250
Four. There's short Jake,
skinny Jake, tall Jake...

19:42.375 --> 19:43.917
this one's stocky with red hair.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.041
Hot Jake?

19:46.959 --> 19:49.375
Standards for the Jakes are really low.

19:50.542 --> 19:53.834
I can't believe Jake likes me.
He's the total package.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.917
The red hair, the freckles,
the way he always smells like bananas,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.333
which in case you didn't know,
are the only fruits in the world...

19:59.417 --> 20:00.750
Amy: Bye-bye now. Bye-bye.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.542
So...

20:09.458 --> 20:13.875
Even though you won't find another guy
who's as crazy about you as I am...

20:15.166 --> 20:16.166
I set you free.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.083
And even though

20:18.208 --> 20:20.875
you'll never find a girl
who's crazier than I am...

20:21.208 --> 20:22.667
about you...

20:24.500 --> 20:25.375
You're free too.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.417
So I guess this is it?

20:29.917 --> 20:32.375
See, this is exactly why
I didn't want to say goodbye to you.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.125
Hey, let's not say goodbye then.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.750
Let's just say...

20:37.458 --> 20:38.417
see you later.

20:59.542 --> 21:00.458
Hey.

21:02.208 --> 21:03.542
It'll be okay, son.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.583
Hey, would you watch it?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.667
I'm having a conversation here, you jerk!

21:10.917 --> 21:11.750
Dad?

21:13.458 --> 21:15.792
Wow, this city really does change you.
Let's get out of here.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.959
Well, Charlie, Dad brought PJ back home

21:27.041 --> 21:29.333
and now he's showing Mom the pictures
he took in New York.

21:29.959 --> 21:31.333
It's just bugs and rats.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.000
I know, right?

21:35.834 --> 21:37.625
Where are you going? I got more.

21:39.333 --> 21:42.625
Oh, speaking of photos,
got my school picture back today.

21:42.709 --> 21:43.542
Wow!

21:46.166 --> 21:48.792
Yeah, if the trend continues,
next year I'll be toothless and bald.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.750
Well, wish me good luck, Charlie.

21:57.625 --> 22:00.041
Wow, tough day.

22:00.834 --> 22:02.208
How you doing? You making any money?

22:03.208 --> 22:05.208
Yeah. You know what the problem is?

22:06.083 --> 22:07.000
New competition.

22:11.917 --> 22:13.041
Thank you.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.208
Come on, man, let's go find a better spot.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.917
Oh, cut it out.

22:22.917 --> 22:24.709
You are not in a box!
