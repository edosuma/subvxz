superheroes here.

41:04.729 --> 41:07.332
‐ Some real‐life superheroes.
And you're one of them.

41:07.332 --> 41:09.367
‐ Another impressive
performance

41:09.367 --> 41:10.735
from Haley Johnson.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.170
She came up just short.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.038
But she'll return
as a competitor

41:14.038 --> 41:15.506
for a shot at redemption

41:15.506 --> 41:18.209
in the Regional Finals
one week from tonight.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.210
‐ I think I was
a little more tired,

41:19.210 --> 41:20.778
a little sore going into it.

41:20.778 --> 41:24.015
But I was literally a second
behind her putting it in.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.250
Going into the Regional Final,

41:26.250 --> 41:28.653
I'm gonna meet Courtney
back on Mount Olympus.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.055
I know I gotta go back out
and kill it,

41:31.055 --> 41:33.024
and bring that Titan title
home for real.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.364
‐ I'm proud of you, honey.
I'm proud of you.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.965
‐ Courtney Roselle says,

41:40.965 --> 41:42.600
"When I was younger..."
‐ You did it.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.968
‐ She was told
by so many people

41:43.968 --> 41:45.403
that she couldn't be a model.

41:45.403 --> 41:46.738
She took that rejection.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.873
She turned it
into her platform.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.743
And that is why
she is here today.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.212
‐ Ladies and gentlemen,
your new Titan,

41:54.212 --> 41:55.213
Courtney Roselle.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.215
[cheers and applause]

41:57.215 --> 41:58.483
That was a hell
of a performance.

41:58.483 --> 42:00.418
You spend a lot of time
inspiring women.

42:00.418 --> 42:01.652
It's very important to you.

42:01.652 --> 42:04.288
And what message
did you send to them today?

42:04.288 --> 42:06.357
‐ All I wanna tell women is

42:06.357 --> 42:07.892
love yourself.
You love others.

42:07.892 --> 42:09.093
It's a domino effect.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.461
Let's keep on
lifting each other up,

42:10.461 --> 42:11.562
'cause that's why we're here.

42:11.562 --> 42:12.830
This is our time.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.699
This is our time to be strong.

42:14.699 --> 42:15.733
And let's do it.

42:15.733 --> 42:16.901
Let's do this together though.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.770
‐ Yes, yes!
‐ Love that.

42:18.770 --> 42:20.605
Congratulations,
brand‐new champion.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.740
Can't wait to see you defend
your title next week

42:22.740 --> 42:24.575
right here
on "The Titan Games."

42:24.575 --> 42:26.844
‐ Thank you.
‐ Courtney Strong.

42:26.844 --> 42:29.781
‐ My girl.
My girl.
