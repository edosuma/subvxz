[announcer]
<i>The Corvus Imperium Truth Ministry</i>

00:14.320 --> 00:17.960
<i>continues to offer its reward</i>
<i>of 40,000 Corvus credits</i>

00:18.040 --> 00:23.080
<i>for any information leading to the capture</i>
<i>and incarceration of the Freebot Fighters.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:28.560
Shh!

00:28.640 --> 00:30.080
[loudly] Shush!

00:31.600 --> 00:34.080
Halt. You are under arrest.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.320
This means, shh, not shush!
And do you know why?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.960
-[Centurion] Halt!
-Mangle now know!

01:27.000 --> 01:29.560
Freebot Fighters, do not move.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.360
Freebot Fighters... where?

01:32.440 --> 01:34.280
Oh, you mean us.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.480
Well, if we’re the Freebot Fighters,
I suppose we should be...

01:38.560 --> 01:40.360
[grunts] ...fighting!

01:42.640 --> 01:44.200
[people shout and scream]

01:49.200 --> 01:50.280
Outnumbered.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.640
Ah! He’s right. A little help?

01:57.520 --> 01:59.080
Thought you’d never ask.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.320
We’d love to join this party.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.640
Halt!

02:05.720 --> 02:06.640
[grunts]

02:06.720 --> 02:11.080
Personally, I prefer parties where
the only dancing you do is to music. Agh!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.000
[pants]

02:30.960 --> 02:32.960
Remind me again why we’re doing this.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.200
[grunts] Someone has to protect the people
from Corvus...

02:36.680 --> 02:38.680
until they can protect themselves.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.200
[grunts] You just make that up?

02:41.280 --> 02:43.840
[grunts] No. You taught it to me.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.040
[Mangle] Protect.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.200
Protect the people. [grunts]

02:54.360 --> 02:55.960
[cheering and whooping]

02:56.040 --> 02:56.920
Yeah!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.280
Mangle, grab those Centurions.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.200
I need their components
to complete our mission.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.920
And now I’d say this party’s over.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.960
<i>And adding to the excitement,</i>

03:10.040 --> 03:13.200
<i>Team Natrix is introducing</i>
<i>three new Combatabots</i>

03:13.280 --> 03:16.320
<i>in today’s mid-season Robozuna Tournament.</i>

03:16.400 --> 03:18.720
<i>The Annihilators!</i>

03:22.200 --> 03:24.920
Don’t like the sound of that.
Who are they?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.160
Team Natrix’s new Combatabots.
How was your mission?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.720
Did Feronia get what she needed?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.120
She thinks so.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.480
We had party.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.600
Well, party’s over! We need to find out
who was here last night.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.320
They tossed my Freebot armour
all over the place.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.200
Which means whoever it was
now knows our secret.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.600
Still say we should leave before
that someone turns us in for the reward.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.680
If they were going to turn us in,
we’d be surrounded by Centurions.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.080
Hey, Chike, you now have two tech pads?

03:54.160 --> 03:57.080
That’s not mine. That’s... Chandra’s!

03:57.160 --> 03:58.920
She... She knows!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.480
The skirmish in the marketplace
this morning,

04:07.560 --> 04:09.920
the Freebot Fighters were seen
with two others.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.040
No doubt one was Feronia...

04:13.040 --> 04:16.320
who you allowed to escape from prison.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.680
Let her play her little games.

04:18.760 --> 04:24.960
I know what her next move will be
and I’ll be there to crush her!

04:27.720 --> 04:31.560
[grunts]

04:32.040 --> 04:34.200
Do your new bots have any special moves?

04:34.280 --> 04:35.760
I mean, what do they do?

04:35.840 --> 04:40.480
The Annihilators? They annihilate!
Want a demo?

04:40.840 --> 04:41.920
No!

04:42.760 --> 04:45.120
Chandra, promise.
Won’t let you down this time.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.200
-[grunts]
-You can trust me.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.760
Good. But right now I got to practise.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.960
Mid-season Robozuna Playoff Tournament,
remember?

04:55.400 --> 04:58.200
Hey, isn’t that the kid
that set us up yesterday?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.240
Almost got us captured?

05:00.640 --> 05:01.680
Yorly.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.920
Better go return this,
see what she’s up to.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.720
Chandra, I believe this tech pad is yours.
Anything you want to talk about?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.320
Anything <i>you </i>want to talk about?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.760
[Xela grunts] Help! Put me down!

05:15.840 --> 05:17.960
[laughter and grunting]

05:18.360 --> 05:21.400
Gizi! Zeve! Come on! Make him stop!

05:21.480 --> 05:25.960
-We’re on the same team!
-So you keep saying, loser! [laughs]

05:26.040 --> 05:27.200
Put him down.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.440
Who’s gonna make us?

05:29.520 --> 05:31.080
I was kind of thinking that...

05:35.000 --> 05:36.120
I would.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.520
[both] Put him down!

05:38.800 --> 05:40.360
[groans]

05:41.840 --> 05:46.320
What do you know? You really are a hero,
even without a disguise.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.680
Don’t worry. I won’t turn you in.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.640
But you were talking to Yorly.
We trusted him. He led us into a trap.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.680
[sighs]

05:55.760 --> 05:58.640
That sounds like Yorly.
I trusted him once, too.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.080
He helped coach, but it didn’t work out.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.640
I was even thinking of giving him
a second chance.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.080
I can’t believe it.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.920
You... you’re one of the Freebot Fighters.
They are my heroes!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.800
I am? I mean... we are?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.480
You really think Chike can win
this game alone?

06:38.800 --> 06:40.240
Chike not alone.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.840
Right. I know he’s got Scramble,

06:42.920 --> 06:47.160
and we’ve played him before,
but he’s still just a crashbot and--

06:47.240 --> 06:50.160
Chike’s got Chandra
and her Team Vulpes bots.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.680
Remember, this is a team-up tournament.
She’s on our side.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.840
Is she really?

06:54.920 --> 06:58.080
Chike said she told him
the Freebot Fighters were her heroes.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.760
Yeah, that’s what Yorly said, too.
I don’t trust her.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
Ariston, what’s really bothering you?

07:08.280 --> 07:12.400
Do we really have to do this,
this Freebot Fighters thing?

07:12.480 --> 07:16.600
I mean, now that Feronia is free,
we could all just go away,

07:16.680 --> 07:17.840
go somewhere safe.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.800
Run away? Stick our heads in the sand?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.760
Pretend all is well with the world?

07:23.240 --> 07:24.720
Pretend there’s no Corvus?

07:24.800 --> 07:28.240
Didn’t say that,
but is this really our fight?

07:28.560 --> 07:30.320
I don’t want to lose any of you.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.080
Protect. Protect the people.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.480
You’re right.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.120
This is another one
of those bigger-than-us moments.

07:38.880 --> 07:42.720
So, what are you all standing around
waiting for? Let’s go!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.600
[Slick] <i>Robo-Robozuna!</i>

07:58.680 --> 08:04.160
It’s finally here!
The mid-season Robozuna play-off between

08:04.240 --> 08:09.480
Teams Veredus/Vulpes
and Teams Natrix/Chiro!

08:09.560 --> 08:12.200
The romper phonic rupture!

08:13.000 --> 08:17.320
Starting off with some two-on-two action!

08:17.400 --> 08:20.920
Team Veredus isn’t even playing
their Combatabots.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Losers! Probably too afraid
of Mega-Batabot. [chuckles]

08:25.800 --> 08:27.800
I’ve had to send the Freebots
on a mission,

08:27.880 --> 08:29.840
so it’s up to us to win this game.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.320
On a mission? They’re really on a mission?

08:32.400 --> 08:36.040
Yeah. I usually lead them,
but I knew you could use me here.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.480
[electronic squeal]

08:37.720 --> 08:39.480
I know, you want to play, Scramble,

08:39.560 --> 08:42.120
but, uh, we’re saving you for when it’s...

08:42.200 --> 08:44.280
-you know, important.
-[buzzer]

08:44.360 --> 08:45.600
[cheering]

08:45.680 --> 08:47.720
[Slick] <i>Game on!</i>

08:51.840 --> 08:54.560
-[cheering]
<i>-Oh, it’s a good start for Team Vulpes,</i>

08:54.640 --> 08:57.560
<i>as Pincer races out</i>
<i>and grabs the thudball!</i>

08:57.640 --> 08:59.720
-[grunting]
-Oi!

08:59.800 --> 09:01.080
Mega-saw!

09:04.320 --> 09:05.480
[groans]

09:05.560 --> 09:07.920
Doesn’t anyone know
we’re on the same team?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.640
It must be so exciting.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.480
It is! We could score!

09:12.560 --> 09:16.400
I mean, being so heroic,
standing up against Corvus.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.440
-You really think you can defeat them?
-Well, there’s always hope.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.280
Right! I love it.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.640
Fighting for a cause, it’s so inspiring.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.560
Uh, shouldn’t you be coaching your team?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.680
Team? Team!

09:31.400 --> 09:33.120
Pincer! Watch out!

09:33.200 --> 09:35.400
[gibbers]

09:36.000 --> 09:38.920
Mega-claw! Mega-saw!

09:39.360 --> 09:41.320
-[grunts]
-[cheering]

09:46.440 --> 09:47.600
Ha-ha-ha!

09:47.680 --> 09:49.720
Now, that’s how we used to do it!

09:52.200 --> 09:53.960
[Slick] <i>No bot can catch him now!</i>

09:54.040 --> 09:55.240
[grunts]

09:55.320 --> 09:57.120
[electronic groan]

09:57.200 --> 10:00.800
[Slick] <i>This game has turned</i>
<i>into a real bot battle!</i>

10:00.880 --> 10:01.840
[grunts]

10:02.400 --> 10:07.680
Score! And that ends round one!
Teams Natrix/Chiro have the lead!

10:08.120 --> 10:09.720
-[electronic gibbering]
-[groans]

10:09.800 --> 10:12.640
Sorry. My fault. Lost focus.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.480
Got a little fan-girly.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.160
Promise, it won’t happen again.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.720
Must be hard being a hero,
not being able to tell anyone.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.520
You ever just want to shout out:
"Hey, look at me..."

10:24.600 --> 10:26.760
The game. Focus on the game.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.440
Right, the game.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.480
So, we ready to do this?

10:42.560 --> 10:45.720
We’re ready. I utilised the components
from the Centurions

10:45.800 --> 10:48.440
to create the control mechanisms
and explosives.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.280
Once we get close,
we’ll first set off the security alarms,

10:54.360 --> 10:57.920
get all the workers out.
We don’t want any casualties.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.720
We just want to destroy the Facility.

11:06.280 --> 11:10.480
-[cheering and buzzer]
-[Slick] Yee-haw! Robozuna round two!

11:17.000 --> 11:22.760
<i>Oh! Fantastic defensive move by Brawler,</i>
<i>who takes Pounder out.</i>

11:22.840 --> 11:25.040
So, teammate Crank gets the thudball.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.240
Robo-Robozuna!

11:27.320 --> 11:30.240
Crank! Pass it to Brawler!

11:30.320 --> 11:34.840
Pass? Right. Pass it to Brawler!
Pass it to Brawler!

11:39.000 --> 11:41.400
The Crush-and-mush!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.960
The Pounder grounder!

11:45.520 --> 11:48.360
[Spanner] <i>Look out!</i>
<i>Crank’s about to get creamed!</i>

11:53.680 --> 11:54.920
Huh.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.160
But no! He passes long!

11:58.240 --> 11:59.560
[grunts] Ow!

12:00.440 --> 12:01.680
[grunts]

12:03.000 --> 12:05.480
[Spanner]
<i>And Brawler makes the one-handed catch!</i>

12:05.560 --> 12:06.960
[Brawler] <i>Spin and win!</i>

12:07.040 --> 12:08.600
-[Spanner] <i>Makes the goal!</i>
-Yeah!

12:08.680 --> 12:13.520
[Spanner] <i>And now this Robozuna game</i>
<i>is all tied up! Aw!</i>

12:19.960 --> 12:21.160
[grunts]

12:34.800 --> 12:36.000
We’ll make this easy.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.920
We plant these on Centurions,
activate explosive timers,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.600
command them into the Facility.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.360
Got it.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.640
Freebot identified. Freebot identified.
Free... [gibbers]

12:55.720 --> 12:57.960
-[gibbering fades]
-Attached and activated.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.960
Good. Once they reboot, we send them in.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.400
-Freebots... destroy.
-This isn’t good. Something’s wrong.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.160
-The initiation modules must be corrupt.
-[bot] Destroy.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.880
In English?

13:10.240 --> 13:12.200
I won’t be able to command them.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.520
So they’re just... walking timebombs?

13:15.840 --> 13:16.760
Pretty much.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.240
Something wrong.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.640
She already said that.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.360
Mangle, what do you see?

13:29.200 --> 13:33.360
Great. Walking timebombs
and now a Corvus Airship.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.680
Danuvia’s airship.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.360
So much for making this easy.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.720
[crowd chant] Robozuna!

13:52.800 --> 13:57.200
[Spanner] <i>I got to say, this third-round,</i>
<i>three-on-three action has been incredible!</i>

13:57.280 --> 14:00.720
<i>What a way to wrap up this mid-season</i>
<i>Robozuna play-off tournament.</i>

14:02.640 --> 14:05.480
Go, Scramble! You can do this!

14:05.560 --> 14:09.160
-You really think so?
-Well, there’s always hope.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.760
[angry electronic grunting]

14:15.000 --> 14:18.120
[grunts and growls]

14:18.560 --> 14:25.000
As my colleague, Slick, might say,
ha, if he could, Robo-Robozuna!

14:25.280 --> 14:28.240
[autotune voice]
The windmill Spin and win!

14:28.880 --> 14:31.440
The Rachet-comin'-atcha!

14:33.000 --> 14:35.400
[autotune voice] Gonna bash you!

14:37.480 --> 14:40.040
[Spanner]
<i>Oh! That’s going to rattle a few bolts.</i>

14:40.120 --> 14:42.200
[grunting laughter]

14:45.920 --> 14:48.560
-[cheering]
-[Spanner] <i>Wow, that caught him off guard!</i>

14:50.200 --> 14:52.000
<i>-Oh, what a hit!</i>
-[cheering]

14:53.000 --> 14:55.120
[Spanner]
<i>Is there a recycler in the house?</i>

14:55.200 --> 14:57.000
[grunts and growls]

15:00.400 --> 15:02.400
[Spanner] <i>Oh! Way they’re playing,</i>

15:02.480 --> 15:04.440
<i>they don’t look like</i>
<i>they could beat a drum.</i>

15:08.200 --> 15:09.760
<i>He’s in trouble now!</i>

15:09.840 --> 15:11.240
[grunting]

15:11.320 --> 15:15.960
There’s the goal!
Shoot the thudball, Scramble, shoot!

15:16.560 --> 15:18.320
[electronic gibbering and whooping]

15:18.400 --> 15:21.280
<i>Send in the crashbots! This game is over!</i>

15:21.360 --> 15:22.920
[electronic squealing]

15:24.000 --> 15:25.880
[grunting]

15:26.680 --> 15:30.040
[Spanner] <i>With the little crashbot</i>
<i>Scramble now on his own,</i>

15:30.120 --> 15:32.480
<i>it doesn’t look good for Veredus/Vulpes.</i>

15:32.560 --> 15:35.960
<i>Still don’t know why they didn’t put</i>
<i>Spark, Clunk or Mangle in.</i>

15:37.680 --> 15:38.920
[electronic squeak]

15:40.480 --> 15:42.480
-[crowd laughs]
-[electronic squeaks]

15:44.800 --> 15:47.640
Scramble! Let him grab you!

15:48.800 --> 15:51.000
[electronic squeak]

15:51.080 --> 15:53.720
[electronic squeal]

15:55.880 --> 15:57.200
Now, Scramble!

15:57.280 --> 15:58.760
Take your shot!

15:58.840 --> 16:01.200
-[electronic squeak and grunt]
-[growls]

16:04.080 --> 16:05.480
Scramble scores!

16:05.560 --> 16:07.680
-Unbelievable!
-[whimpers]

16:07.760 --> 16:10.560
Teams Veredus/Vulpes wins the game!

16:10.960 --> 16:14.880
So, how’s it feel to be losers?

16:14.960 --> 16:15.960
Hm! Huh!

16:24.040 --> 16:25.760
-[grunts]
-[Spark] The taser-jab!

16:29.160 --> 16:30.240
[grunts]

16:30.680 --> 16:32.040
Feronia!

16:32.120 --> 16:35.120
Always choosing the wrong side. [grunts]

16:35.720 --> 16:36.960
[grunts]

16:37.040 --> 16:39.400
Does which side I choose bother you?

16:39.480 --> 16:42.120
Or just that I had a choice? [grunts]

16:43.040 --> 16:45.240
[grunting]

16:48.160 --> 16:49.000
Oh!

16:51.840 --> 16:53.560
[grunting and panting]

16:54.880 --> 16:56.120
[grunting]

16:58.400 --> 16:59.600
[groans]

17:04.200 --> 17:05.560
Protect.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.840
Right. Got to help her.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.680
No. Protect.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.400
Protect the people.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.480
Right. Better move fast!

17:20.320 --> 17:21.920
Mind if we borrow these?

17:24.600 --> 17:26.800
Be right back! Got a plan!

17:27.520 --> 17:31.360
Is it just me or does it scare you, too,
whenever he says that?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.920
Okay, the Facility’s empty.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.440
So, we just plant these where
Feronia said the prototypes were,

17:37.520 --> 17:39.000
and kablooey,

17:39.080 --> 17:40.640
mission accomplished.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.200
Must be the place.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.360
[bleeping]

17:53.440 --> 17:54.280
Perfect!

17:57.280 --> 17:58.480
Not so perfect.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.440
Halt!

18:07.640 --> 18:08.600
[yells]

18:09.200 --> 18:10.200
Protect.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.560
Huh! Don’t think that look's
going to catch on.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.280
Think I’ll make sure of it. [grunts]

18:29.240 --> 18:32.400
There’s too many of them.
We’ll never fight our way out in time.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.840
Kablooey?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.640
Yeah, any time now.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.280
Mangle have plan.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.960
Don’t need a plan.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.800
Need to get through that door.

18:46.840 --> 18:47.920
[electronic grunt]

18:48.800 --> 18:51.160
[Ariston]
Or we could just make a new door.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.240
And another!

18:57.800 --> 18:59.600
[distant explosion]

19:04.560 --> 19:06.680
[gasps and grunts]

19:06.760 --> 19:07.640
[gasps]

19:08.200 --> 19:09.040
[grunts]

19:10.680 --> 19:11.520
[gasps]

19:20.000 --> 19:21.600
[grunting and groaning]

19:24.440 --> 19:25.280
[grunts]

19:29.200 --> 19:31.200
This should keep you in your place.

19:32.080 --> 19:32.960
[groans]

19:33.840 --> 19:35.800
Goodbye, Danuvia!

19:37.400 --> 19:39.760
[pants and groans]

19:41.800 --> 19:44.640
Chandra! Congrats on the win.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.360
When do I start? Next game?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.200
No, sorry, Yorly.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.040
Decided not going to need
an assistant coach after all.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.480
What? But you said...

19:54.560 --> 19:55.480
Oh!

19:55.560 --> 19:57.760
You can’t trust anyone these days!

20:02.880 --> 20:06.680
Hey, guys Chandra wants to talk about
splitting up the prize money.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.240
I thought I’d give a portion of mine
to the Freebot Fighters.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.440
Protect the people.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.080
Heard you might know
how to get it to them.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.160
Wow. Thanks!

20:18.240 --> 20:21.040
I mean, yeah, we’ll make sure they get it.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.720
Course, winning this mid-season
Robozuna tournament together

20:24.800 --> 20:26.800
means we’re both tied for first place.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.480
Going to have to really whup your bots
next time we play.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.800
We still have a long way to go
to defeat Corvus,

20:36.880 --> 20:40.560
but tonight, we stopped them
from becoming unbeatable.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.600
There’s still hope.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.560
You’re sure about this?

20:52.640 --> 20:54.760
Sergeant Farrago just confirmed it.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.480
He and his Centurions
scoured the Facility.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.000
All Project Evolution prototypes
were destroyed.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.920
And thanks to the virus you allowed
Feronia to plant into our computer system,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.520
all our research is now destroyed as well.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.120
Doesn’t matter. I have a plan B.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.680
[he gasps]

21:21.960 --> 21:23.960
Don’t worry. They’re not real.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.800
But this is.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.720
Meet Dominatus!

21:36.000 --> 21:38.640
[cackles]
