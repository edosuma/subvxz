01:24.800 --> 01:30.840
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.200
I want mead!

01:34.280 --> 01:36.600
Give me some mead, my Queen!

01:41.480 --> 01:45.600
Thank you, my beautiful Queen.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.520
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

01:56.640 --> 01:58.840
This is how it works, Aesher.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.400
After you die,
you wouldn't really be dead

02:02.480 --> 02:07.200
providing you have accepted him
as the one and only God.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.120
All right, back! Back!

02:41.640 --> 02:43.240
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.040
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!
I want a kiss!

02:46.120 --> 02:48.240
Please, stop it!

02:52.920 --> 02:54.080
More!

02:56.600 --> 02:59.760
My thanes, my beautiful thanes!

02:59.840 --> 03:03.000
One year ago, I, Hrothgar, your King

03:03.120 --> 03:05.800
swore that we would
celebrate our victories

03:05.880 --> 03:09.240
in a new hall, mighty and beautiful!

03:09.920 --> 03:13.280
Have I not kept my oath? Yeah.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.360
In this hall, we shall divide
the spoils of our conquests,

03:18.440 --> 03:20.640
the gold and the treasure.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.640
And this shall be a place of merriment,
joy, and fornication!

03:30.160 --> 03:35.920
From now until the end of time,
I name this hall Herot!

03:38.400 --> 03:41.560
Treasure!
Let's hand out some treasure!

03:43.000 --> 03:44.440
Give me some of that!

03:44.640 --> 03:46.160
From my conquests!

03:47.880 --> 03:49.600
Unferth!

03:49.720 --> 03:55.080
For Unferth, for Unferth,
my wisest advisor,

03:55.200 --> 04:01.120
violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.920
Unferth, where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.240
I'm here, my King.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.640
Unferth, come here, you ungrateful lout!

04:24.160 --> 04:29.720
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

04:29.800 --> 04:33.640
<i>He faced a demon dragon
When other men would freeze</i>

04:33.720 --> 04:37.480
<i>And then, my lords, he took his sword
And brought it to its knees...</i>

04:37.560 --> 04:39.280
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

04:39.400 --> 04:41.880
<i>The greatest of our kings</i>

04:43.120 --> 04:45.520
<i>He broke the dragon's wings</i>

04:46.280 --> 04:48.120
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

04:48.880 --> 04:52.920
<i>The kingdom fell in darkness
And shadows ruled the night</i>

04:53.000 --> 04:56.760
<i>With no sign of dawn, he soldiered on
And brought us back to life</i>

04:56.840 --> 04:58.560
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

04:58.680 --> 05:00.480
<i>He never shook your faith</i>

05:00.600 --> 05:02.200
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

05:02.320 --> 05:04.920
<i>Let every cup be raised</i>

05:05.400 --> 05:08.080
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

06:13.480 --> 06:17.200
<i>He offered us protection
When monsters roamed the land</i>

06:17.320 --> 06:21.320
<i>And one by one, he took them on
They perished at his hand</i>

06:22.600 --> 06:24.120
Mead!

06:25.080 --> 06:26.520
Mead!

06:27.400 --> 06:28.720
Mead!

06:28.840 --> 06:32.480
You're spilling it. Where's my mead?
You're spilling it.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.280
You're spilling it!

06:35.160 --> 06:37.160
Cain, you clumsy idiot!

06:37.280 --> 06:39.760
How dare you waste the King's mead?

06:49.040 --> 06:52.800
<i>He rose up like a savior
When every hope was gone</i>

06:52.880 --> 06:54.800
<i>The beast was gored
and peace restored</i>

06:54.920 --> 06:56.640
<i>His memory will live on</i>

06:56.840 --> 06:58.360
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

06:58.440 --> 07:00.480
<i>Let every cup be raised</i>

07:00.560 --> 07:02.080
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

07:02.200 --> 07:04.880
<i>Now and forever</i>

08:23.600 --> 08:26.200
A sword! Give me a sword!

08:33.120 --> 08:35.039
Come! Arm yourselves!

08:37.039 --> 08:38.760
Stay down, my Lady!

08:54.800 --> 08:56.880
- Give me a sword! A sword!
- My Lord!

09:40.360 --> 09:41.960
No!

10:14.600 --> 10:15.720
Fight me!

10:17.160 --> 10:18.400
Fight me!

10:22.440 --> 10:23.680
Fight me.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.920
You fight me, damn you.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.080
Nay.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.680
What was that?

12:00.560 --> 12:02.000
Grendel.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.640
Grendel, what have you done?

12:15.920 --> 12:18.880
<i>What hafast flu done, Grendel?</i>

12:25.760 --> 12:28.960
Fish and wolf and bear

12:29.040 --> 12:30.960
and sheep or two,

12:31.040 --> 12:33.160
<i>ac nan men.</i>

12:45.440 --> 12:47.080
Men, Grendel.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.080
They have slain so many of our kind.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.640
Was Hrothgar there?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.320
Good.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.200
Good boy.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.040
And tender.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.760
Men, build another pyre!

13:57.840 --> 14:00.240
There's dry wood behind the stables.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.240
Then burn the dead.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.800
And seal the hall!
Close the doors and the windows.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.520
And by the King's order,

14:07.640 --> 14:10.880
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.960
This place reeks of death.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.480
The scops are singing
the shame of Herot

14:18.560 --> 14:23.080
as far south as the middle kingdom
and as far north as the ice-lands.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.240
I've let it be known that
I will give half the gold in my kingdom

14:26.440 --> 14:28.720
to any man who can rid us of Grendel.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.440
My King, for deliverance

14:30.560 --> 14:35.040
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.080
With your permission,

14:37.160 --> 14:41.480
shall we also pray
to the new Roman god, Christ Jesus?

14:41.560 --> 14:44.280
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.120
No, Unferth, no.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.520
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.160
What we need is a hero.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.160
Hold your oars up!

15:05.760 --> 15:07.200
And heave!

15:10.640 --> 15:14.000
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.160
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

15:17.240 --> 15:20.120
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.920
We're lost! Given to the sea!

15:23.000 --> 15:24.560
The sea's my mother!

15:24.640 --> 15:27.520
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.120
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.560
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

15:45.080 --> 15:46.400
Heave!

15:48.720 --> 15:51.960
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.040
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.320
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out

15:58.480 --> 16:01.000
if we really want in!

16:04.240 --> 16:05.880
Who wants to live?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.400
We do!

16:07.520 --> 16:11.040
Then pull your oars! Let's see you do it!

16:11.160 --> 16:12.960
For Beowulf!

16:13.080 --> 16:14.800
For gold!

16:14.880 --> 16:16.160
For glory!

16:36.960 --> 16:40.040
Heave! Heave!

16:41.760 --> 16:44.440
Heave! Heave!

16:54.400 --> 16:55.640
Beowulf.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.200
Hold fast!

16:59.000 --> 16:59.880
No.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.000
Who are you?
From your dress, you are warriors.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.520
Speak! Why should I
not run you through right now?

17:22.599 --> 17:25.000
We are Geats.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.599
I am Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.880
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar
in friendship.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.840
They say you have a monster here?

17:35.920 --> 17:38.240
They say your lands are cursed.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.280
Is that what they say?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.120
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame

17:41.200 --> 17:43.600
from the frozen North
to the shores of Vinland.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.440
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

17:45.520 --> 17:49.640
I am Beowulf!
And I am here to kill your monster.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.840
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough

17:54.920 --> 17:57.240
to come around here
and die for our gold.

17:57.320 --> 18:02.040
If we die, it'll be for glory, not for gold.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.720
My Lord?

18:15.840 --> 18:19.080
My Lord?
There are warriors outside. Geats.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.440
But they are no beggars,

18:20.520 --> 18:22.080
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

18:22.160 --> 18:24.360
Beowulf? Ecgtheow's little boy?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.040
Beowulf. Where is he? Where?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.720
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome, my boy.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.880
Welcome. Yes. How's your father?

18:33.960 --> 18:35.280
Dead.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.280
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.280
Well, he was a brave man.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.080
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.280
I've come to kill your monster.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.680
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.920
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead

18:55.840 --> 19:00.040
and many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.640
But in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them

19:04.760 --> 19:07.320
but blood to be cleaned from the floor

19:08.000 --> 19:10.800
and the benches, and the walls.

19:16.240 --> 19:20.000
I have drunk nothing, yet.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.400
But I will kill your monster.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.280
He will kill the monster.
Did you hear that? Grendel will die.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.360
- Grendel?
- Yeah, the monster is called Grendel.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.400
Then I will kill your Grendel.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.520
I, Beowulf,
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

19:40.600 --> 19:43.680
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

19:43.760 --> 19:48.560
and this troll of yours
will trouble you no more.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.200
A hero! A hero!
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

19:52.320 --> 19:55.480
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

19:55.560 --> 19:57.400
and kill the monster in its den?

19:57.480 --> 20:02.280
I have 14 brave thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

20:04.280 --> 20:09.200
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead

20:09.280 --> 20:10.920
famed across the world

20:11.000 --> 20:15.440
and to feast
in your legendary mead hall.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.960
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.800
Merrymaking in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.880
Well, then.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.440
Open the mead hall! Let's drink!

21:10.960 --> 21:13.640
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.720
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.200
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.640
Five days? In the name of Odin,
no wonder my loins are burning!

21:30.720 --> 21:32.920
Beowulf, there you are.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.800
I was thinking about your father.
Great man.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.120
He was fleeing the Wulfings

21:37.240 --> 21:39.640
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.520
- Heatholaf.
- That's it, yeah. That's right.

21:42.600 --> 21:47.200
I paid the blood debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

21:47.320 --> 21:51.120
So I saved his skin,
and you're here to save ours, that right?

21:58.320 --> 22:01.480
All hail the great Beowulf,

22:01.600 --> 22:06.080
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

22:07.360 --> 22:11.960
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

22:12.040 --> 22:17.720
But can I ask a question,
as a huge admirer of yours?

22:24.240 --> 22:27.960
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of

22:28.080 --> 22:32.760
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.840
Was that you?

22:35.920 --> 22:38.040
I swam against Brecca.

22:42.840 --> 22:46.840
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

22:46.960 --> 22:49.720
someone else of the same name.

22:49.840 --> 22:54.040
Because, you see,
the Beowulf I heard of

22:54.160 --> 22:57.600
swam against Brecca and lost.

22:58.360 --> 23:02.280
He risked his life and Brecca's

23:02.400 --> 23:05.640
to serve his own vanity and pride.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.160
A boastful fool.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.040
And he lost!

23:12.160 --> 23:15.720
So I thought it had to be someone else.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.280
I swam against Brecca.

23:22.160 --> 23:26.160
But victory was his, not yours.

23:26.280 --> 23:31.160
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

23:32.720 --> 23:34.800
Speaking only for myself here,

23:36.440 --> 23:40.480
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment

23:40.560 --> 23:42.080
against Grendel,

23:42.200 --> 23:47.200
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.560
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.480
But it's true, I did not win the race.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.760
<i>We swam for five days, neck and neck.</i>

24:06.840 --> 24:10.680
<i>I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch</i>

24:10.760 --> 24:13.560
<i>when this storm blew up</i>

24:14.320 --> 24:17.280
<i>and with it came sea monsters.</i>

24:30.520 --> 24:34.160
<i>Again and again, the monsters attacked!</i>

24:34.280 --> 24:37.720
<i>Dark things from the sea's depths.</i>

24:45.680 --> 24:50.560
<i>I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,</i>

24:50.680 --> 24:53.080
<i>spilling their guts into the sea.</i>

25:03.320 --> 25:06.600
Beowulf!

25:13.600 --> 25:18.560
Then one of them seized me by its jaws

25:22.120 --> 25:24.240
<i>and dragged me to the bottom.</i>

25:49.760 --> 25:53.960
<i>I killed the monster with my own blade</i>

25:55.200 --> 25:58.200
and I plunged it into its heart.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.280
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.600
And you killed, what was it? 20?

26:09.520 --> 26:10.960
Nine.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.240
Last time it were three.

26:13.360 --> 26:17.080
But would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

26:20.160 --> 26:23.520
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.840
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.480
I know who you are.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.080
They say you killed both your brothers

26:36.160 --> 26:39.800
when you witnessed them
having knowledge of your mother.

26:41.040 --> 26:45.200
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

26:45.280 --> 26:49.480
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

26:49.600 --> 26:52.760
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

26:52.840 --> 26:55.080
without fear of retaliation.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.360
Tonight will be different!

26:57.440 --> 27:02.160
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting
for him, not frightened sheep

27:07.800 --> 27:09.360
like you.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.680
Well done!

27:18.000 --> 27:22.480
That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.480
So you will kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

27:28.800 --> 27:34.200
Well, let's all drink in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.960
<i>Lips ripe as the berries in June</i>

27:47.040 --> 27:50.880
<i>Red the rose, red the rose</i>

27:50.960 --> 27:55.080
<i>Skin pale as the light of the moon</i>

27:55.200 --> 27:58.640
<i>Gently as she goes</i>

27:59.400 --> 28:00.960
<i>Eyes blue as the sea and the sky</i>

28:01.040 --> 28:03.360
Beowulf. Come.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.360
<i>Water flows, water flows</i>

28:05.440 --> 28:07.360
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

28:07.480 --> 28:11.400
<i>Heart burning like fire in the night</i>

28:11.480 --> 28:14.840
<i>Gently as she goes</i>

28:19.640 --> 28:20.720
Come.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.280
There.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.160
The Royal Dragon Horn.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.880
It is beautiful.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.920
Isn't it magnificent?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.320
She's the prize of my treasure.

28:39.400 --> 28:44.200
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,
the dragon of the Northern moors.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.320
Nearly cost me my life.

28:47.160 --> 28:51.480
And there's a soft spot
under the throat, there.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.840
See? You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.280
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

29:02.600 --> 29:07.400
I wonder how many men
have died for love of her beauty.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.200
Can you blame them?

29:10.760 --> 29:13.640
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

29:14.600 --> 29:19.400
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.720
You do me great honor.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.360
It is we who are honored.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.720
Is that your demon?

29:49.800 --> 29:52.400
That was a wolf.
You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.280
No? Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.200
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

29:59.400 --> 30:00.720
to ecstasy and back.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.600
No other man
will ever be able to satisfy you again.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.320
- Sorry.
- Come on!

30:05.440 --> 30:07.720
- I said no and I meant no.
- Why not?

30:07.840 --> 30:11.960
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

30:12.040 --> 30:14.640
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

30:19.920 --> 30:22.800
The hour is upon us.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.960
This old man needs his sleep.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.360
Where's my beautiful bedmate?
Come, my love.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.200
In a moment.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.120
Come, Wealthow,
let us pound the pillows.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.440
Don't touch me!

30:42.240 --> 30:44.280
That's the spirit, my girl.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.280
My Lord!

30:51.000 --> 30:55.600
Perhaps Her Majesty
could grace our ears

30:55.680 --> 31:00.080
with one more melody
before we all retire?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.080
It's the least I can do.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.400
Beowulf, I'll hope to see you
in the morning, Odin willing.

31:19.280 --> 31:23.120
And make sure
your thanes secure the doors.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.960
Good night. Good night.

31:29.360 --> 31:33.080
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea monsters.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.840
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.880
<i>Just wait</i>

31:47.000 --> 31:49.760
<i>Though wide he may roam</i>

31:49.880 --> 31:55.160
<i>Always a hero comes home</i>

31:58.800 --> 32:04.160
<i>He goes where no one has gone</i>

32:04.360 --> 32:08.960
<i>But always a hero comes home</i>

32:28.320 --> 32:33.600
<i>He goes where no one has gone</i>

32:33.720 --> 32:39.920
<i>But always a hero comes home</i>

32:45.400 --> 32:48.280
That was beautiful.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.000
You need to go now, Your Majesty.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.800
Of course. Grendel.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.360
The demon is my husband's shame.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.960
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.480
No, shame.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.760
My husband has no other. No sons.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.440
And he will have no more,
for all his talk.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.480
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?

33:32.600 --> 33:34.320
Nah. Not my type.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.240
I know your type.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.320
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

33:47.240 --> 33:50.120
The creature has no sword, no armor.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.600
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.800
We shall fight as equals.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.800
And fate

33:59.920 --> 34:01.560
shall decide.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.880
Good. Tie it off with more chain.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.360
Enough frican' about!

34:38.760 --> 34:40.880
You're mad, you know that?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.320
Yes.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.560
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

34:53.239 --> 34:56.040
I don't like the smell of this one,
my Lord.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.080
The men are unprepared.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.400
They're distracted.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.360
Too many untended women here!

35:04.480 --> 35:07.160
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

35:09.720 --> 35:13.200
A warrior's mind must be unblurred,
my Lord.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.000
Good night, Wiglaf.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.040
And while you're sleeping,
what're we meant to do?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.640
Sing! Loudly!

35:27.000 --> 35:30.440
Well, you heard him.
He wants us to sing. So sing!

35:30.560 --> 35:32.000
Olaf, sing!

35:36.600 --> 35:40.040
<i>There was a dozen virgins</i>

35:40.120 --> 35:41.880
<i>Friesians, Danes and Franks</i>

35:41.960 --> 35:45.720
<i>We took them for some swifan
And all we got were wanks</i>

35:45.800 --> 35:50.120
<i>Oh, we are Beowulf's army
Each a mighty thane</i>

35:50.320 --> 35:52.800
<i>We'll pummel your asses
And ravage your lasses</i>

35:52.880 --> 35:54.040
<i>Then do it all over again</i>

35:54.160 --> 35:57.400
<i>The fattest of the virgins
I knew her for a whore</i>

35:57.480 --> 36:00.680
<i>I gave her all my codpiece
And still she wanted more</i>

36:00.760 --> 36:04.000
<i>Her sister was from Norway
She cost me 20 groats</i>

36:04.120 --> 36:07.480
<i>She showed me there was more ways
Than one to sow my oats</i>

36:07.560 --> 36:10.640
<i>Her mother was from Iceland
And she was mighty hot</i>

36:10.720 --> 36:14.280
<i>She'd need a whole damn iceberg
To cool her burning...</i>

36:19.160 --> 36:21.680
Grendel. He knocks.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.520
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.560
She's ready for me
to taste her juicy fruit.

36:28.680 --> 36:29.640
My Lord.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.200
Patience, patience, my love.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.160
No! Hondshew! No!

36:51.320 --> 36:54.280
Swife me! It's the frican' monster!

38:43.240 --> 38:45.800
I swear, the bastard has no pintel!

39:25.320 --> 39:26.960
- No pintel.
- Aye.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.520
- The demon shrinks!
- It shrinks! It shrinks!

40:11.640 --> 40:14.520
Demon!

40:52.200 --> 40:56.160
Your bloodletting
days are finished, demon!

41:01.120 --> 41:03.240
It speaks. It speaks!

41:07.160 --> 41:12.080
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.920
I am the teeth in the darkness,
the talons in the night.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.240
Mine is strength and lust and power!

41:19.360 --> 41:21.480
I am Beowulf!

41:46.480 --> 41:48.040
Grendel's arm!

41:49.280 --> 41:50.720
You've done it!

41:52.920 --> 41:54.280
He's done it!

41:55.040 --> 41:58.760
He's torn the limbs from the beast!
Beowulf has killed him!

42:00.680 --> 42:03.560
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

42:03.680 --> 42:06.240
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

42:06.360 --> 42:09.240
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

42:11.160 --> 42:14.040
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon!

42:15.760 --> 42:17.480
Odin be praised.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.280
- Go tell the scops. Spread the word!
- Yes, my Lord.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.400
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.280
Our nightmare is over.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.800
Come to bed, my sweet.

42:38.680 --> 42:43.080
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son! It's time you did your duty.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.720
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

42:50.280 --> 42:52.400
I should never have told you.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.600
I should never have told you.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.680
My poor son.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.280
Sleep now, my son.

43:40.640 --> 43:42.720
Who murdered you, my son?

43:50.200 --> 43:53.760
<i>He will pay, meen darling.</i>

44:35.000 --> 44:36.520
Beowulf.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.880
They were great warriors.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.320
They died a foul death.

44:51.400 --> 44:55.800
They were murdered by a foul creature
from the depths of hell.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.360
The bards
will sing of their glory forever.

45:04.720 --> 45:08.360
Come, let us drink to their memory.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.160
I want you to raise the first cup.

45:11.240 --> 45:14.600
I am not in the mood for merrymaking.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.760
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

45:19.600 --> 45:23.040
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,
do we not?

45:24.960 --> 45:26.120
Aye.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.360
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

45:31.280 --> 45:35.920
this place for me
has been a hall of sadness.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.400
And for all of us,

45:38.480 --> 45:41.960
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed, and death.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.960
But today,
the monster's reign has ended.

45:46.080 --> 45:50.080
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

45:50.200 --> 45:54.200
I wonder if Beowulf's strength is only
in his arms, or in his legs as well,

45:54.320 --> 45:56.120
all three of them?

45:57.200 --> 46:00.440
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.720
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.240
Bring it here!

46:05.840 --> 46:07.560
Wealthow, my love,

46:08.880 --> 46:11.400
why don't you do the honors?

46:25.400 --> 46:26.920
For you, my Lord.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.880
Thank you, great King.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.960
And all of you,

46:44.960 --> 46:49.160
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.160
I was asleep when he arrived.

46:52.240 --> 46:56.080
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

46:56.280 --> 47:01.240
He stood 20 feet tall,
possessing the strength of 10 men.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.040
I looked at him and said,
"I am Beowulf!"

48:44.840 --> 48:46.360
Brave thane.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.600
My Queen.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.400
I love you.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.800
I want you, my King.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.160
Only you.

49:07.960 --> 49:11.200
<i>My hero, meen looviyend.</i>

49:12.440 --> 49:14.000
I don't understand.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.240
Where's your husband?

49:17.640 --> 49:18.880
Dead.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.760
Dead?

49:23.480 --> 49:25.320
This is a dream.

49:26.160 --> 49:29.440
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.320
Me, darling? A dream?

49:34.240 --> 49:39.320
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

50:12.000 --> 50:14.800
In the name of Odin!

50:16.320 --> 50:18.240
Is Grendel not dead?

50:19.400 --> 50:22.280
Has he grown his arm anew?

50:22.360 --> 50:24.560
It's not Grendel.

50:24.680 --> 50:27.160
Not Grendel? Then who?

50:27.240 --> 50:28.600
His mother.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.240
It's Grendel you killed.

50:32.360 --> 50:36.760
I had hoped his mother
had left the land long, long ago.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.880
How many monsters must I slay?

50:42.320 --> 50:45.280
Grendel's mother? Father?
Grendel's uncle?

50:45.400 --> 50:48.640
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

50:48.760 --> 50:50.000
She is the last of them.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.320
With her gone,

50:51.440 --> 50:54.880
demonkind will slip back
into the darkness from whence it came.

50:54.960 --> 50:56.400
Where it belongs.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.520
And the mother's mate?
Where is Grendel's father?

51:04.080 --> 51:06.960
Grendel's father
can do no harm to man.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.440
Beowulf,

51:13.400 --> 51:17.880
I was wrong to doubt you before,
and I shall not again.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.920
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.680
Granted.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.880
Cain! Cain!

51:37.760 --> 51:41.960
Take my sword.
It belonged to my father's father.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.280
It's called "Hrunting."

51:44.360 --> 51:47.800
That sword is no match
for demon magic.

51:49.160 --> 51:51.280
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

51:56.160 --> 52:00.480
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.560
They were hasty words.

52:06.440 --> 52:10.080
Unferth, I may not return.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.760
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

52:15.520 --> 52:19.080
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.680
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

52:33.560 --> 52:35.400
are you still with me?

52:37.800 --> 52:39.240
To the end.

53:06.280 --> 53:07.320
Look.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.080
She's probably a water demon.

53:15.200 --> 53:17.120
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

53:17.200 --> 53:18.360
I know.

53:19.800 --> 53:22.400
Do you want me to go in with you?

53:22.480 --> 53:24.000
Good.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.560
I'll be here.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.240
I see you've brought me treasure.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.560
Show yourself!

55:41.160 --> 55:42.480
What are you?

56:28.720 --> 56:31.400
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

56:50.400 --> 56:52.320
The Bee-Wolf.

56:54.040 --> 56:55.400
The bear.

57:07.200 --> 57:10.360
Such a strong man you are.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.520
With the strength of a king.

57:15.160 --> 57:18.320
The king you will one day become.

57:20.880 --> 57:24.840
What do you know of me, demon?

57:24.920 --> 57:29.040
I know that underneath your glamour

57:29.160 --> 57:33.280
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.200
My glamour?

57:38.240 --> 57:42.480
One needs glamour to become a king.

57:44.880 --> 57:50.240
A man like you could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

57:51.400 --> 57:54.160
Your story would live on

57:54.280 --> 57:59.640
when everything now alive is dust.

58:06.720 --> 58:08.000
Beowulf.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.080
It has been a long time

58:13.160 --> 58:15.760
since a man has come to visit me.

58:16.920 --> 58:19.320
I need no sword to kill you.

58:21.400 --> 58:24.400
Of course you don't, my love.

58:26.880 --> 58:29.360
You took a son from me.

58:31.200 --> 58:34.080
Give me a son, brave thane.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.200
Stay with me.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.960
Love me.

58:43.080 --> 58:45.000
Love me

58:45.120 --> 58:51.040
and I shall weave you riches
beyond imagination.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.880
I shall make you

58:55.640 --> 58:59.200
the greatest king that ever lived.

59:07.080 --> 59:11.360
As long as you hold me in your heart

59:11.480 --> 59:16.760
and this golden horn
remains in my keeping,

59:18.200 --> 59:20.480
you will forever be king.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.920
Forever strong,

59:26.160 --> 59:27.680
mighty

59:28.360 --> 59:30.360
and all powerful.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.960
This I promise.

59:39.480 --> 59:44.000
This I swear.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.320
My Lord.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.240
It's dead, my Lady.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.840
When I finished off
Grendel's monstrous mother,

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960
I severed the brute's head.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.840
Our curse is lifted.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.600
Our curse is lifted. Odin be praised!

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.480
Beowulf be praised!

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.360
Our curse is lifted.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.880
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.760
Into the sea, quickly.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.560
I plunged Hrunting
into Grendel's mother's chest

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.400
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.920
the creature sprang back to life,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.320
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.480
Till Ragnarok, huh?

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.480
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.440
More mead, my Lord?

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.600
Aye.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.040
And the drinking horn, do you have it?

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.880
No.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.920
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.320
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.800
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.000
When she was dead, I looked for it,
but it was gone forever.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.800
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.680
First, the hero and I must talk.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.560
Beowulf.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.920
So you brought back
the head of Grendel.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.160
What about the head of the mother?

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.800
With her dead and cold in the bog,

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.160
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.320
Did you kill her?

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.440
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.880
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.880
But answer me, did you kill her?

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.760
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.600
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.160
He can bother me no more.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.760
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.000
Not anymore.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.960
Not anymore.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.000
Listen to me!

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.840
Listen to me!

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.200
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.440
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.000
and laid its mother in her grave...

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.600
- To Beowulf!
- Long live Beowulf!

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.760
...and because I have no heir,

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.600
I have no sons,

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.320
I declare that on my death,

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.360
all that I possess, my kingdom,

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.320
my hall of sadness and shame,

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.640
and even my lovely young Queen,

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.160
my Wealthow,

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.400
everything, everything

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.280
I leave to this, our hero.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.560
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.800
I have spoken!

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.560
When I am gone,

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.960
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.720
Beowulf!

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.640
My Lord.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.400
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.720
Hrothgar!

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.600
He must have fallen.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.400
- All hail King Beowulf.
- All hail King Beowulf.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.720
All hail King Beowulf.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.200
King Beowulf.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.520
Archers.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.320
Archers!

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.840
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.680
This is slaughter.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.840
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.040
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.080
It's going to be a short song.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.520
Now, can you blame them?

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.320
Your legend is known
from the high seas

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.520
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.440
You are the monster slayer.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.840
We men are the monsters now.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.560
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.800
The Christ God has killed it,

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.720
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.480
fear and shame.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.320
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.200
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.640
Leave him!

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.560
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.920
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.640
Coward!

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.240
Kill me yourself!

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.800
Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.840
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.120
Stop!

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.240
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.479
Let him up.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.960
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:31.479
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.120
I'm Finn of Frisia

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.200
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.200
Only if you kill me!

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.040
Otherwise, you're nothing.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.240
You think you're the first to try to kill me,
or the hundredth?

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.840
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.200
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:05.600
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.840
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.720
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.800
Someone give him a sword, or I'll...

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.520
You'll what? Kill me?

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:28.720
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.200
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.440
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.880
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.880
He has a story to tell.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.320
Your Majesty?

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.600
Are you hurt?

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.600
Not a scratch.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.600
So beautiful.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.680
And so young.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.120
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.080
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.640
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.800
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.040
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.520
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.880
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.760
Perhaps tonight?

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.680
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.000
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.440
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.280
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.240
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.720
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.200
I see you've survived.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.680
Alas, my Queen,

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.200
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.480
You are not a widow,

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.520
yet.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.920
How comforting, my husband.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.480
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.160
Unferth.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.800
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.000
I have something for the King.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.200
What is it?

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.080
I said I have something for the King.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.480
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.680
You will show it to me first.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.720
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.400
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.840
The King

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.600
needs to see what?

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.840
Lost and now found.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.040
A gift fit for a king.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.600
Do you recognize it?

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.640
Where did you find this?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.720
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.280
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.080
My Lord,

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.240
isn't this...

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.600
So, Lord Beowulf,

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.960
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.480
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.800
Please, please don't kill me!

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.760
Where did you find this treasure?

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.640
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.560
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.840
Stop.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.720
Where?

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.280
Up, up on the moors.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.880
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.560
Is that all?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.680
No demon? No witch?

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.600
No woman?

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.480
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.120
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.600
<i>Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!</i>

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.440
Look at you. You're nothing,

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.120
an empty nothing.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.920
Come forth!

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.960
Show yourself!

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.240
Even with all your riches,

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.720
your kingdom, your power, your glory

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.000
and your women.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.800
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.000
your pretty little bedwarmer,

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.800
or your wise Queen?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.840
What are you?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.240
I'm something you left behind,

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.760
Father!

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.920
Another restless night?

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.520
It's all right, girl.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.280
I'm not going to eat you.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.560
He has bad dreams.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.800
They've been coming more often.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.240
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.520
He calls your name in his sleep.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.880
Does he?

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.200
I believe he still holds you in his heart.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.240
Do you?

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.640
I often wonder

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.360
what happened.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.800
To us?

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.200
Too many secrets.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.440
God, help us.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.600
What? What do you want of me?

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.160
I have a message for my father.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.400
Tell me! What did this?

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.720
I saw our whole village burn.
Children screaming as they died!

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.720
I saw it, Your Majesty,
vomiting fire and smoke!

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.600
Damn you! What was it?

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.160
A dragon!

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.520
- It's Unferth, my Lord!
- Unferth.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.960
You say a dragon did this? Stop!

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.320
You had an agreement.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.120
You would not be harmed.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.000
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.480
The agreement is ended.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600
Who? Who said that?

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.880
"The sins of the fathers!"

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.720
That's the last thing I heard.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.160
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.840
The sins of the fathers!

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.040
Sins of the fathers!

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.120
The sins of the fathers!

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.040
The sins of the fathers!

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.240
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.040
It is our only hope if I fail.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.400
My Lord.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.960
Don't go, I beg you!

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.360
You are free. I release you.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.440
Find a good man and bear him children.
But bear him a son.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.360
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.920
I am not the man you think me to be!

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.160
You're a great man! And a hero!
This I know to be true.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.040
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.480
Very impressive, dear.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.920
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.880
I'm sure it did.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.080
Why don't you take that poor girl

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.360
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.040
Let some young hero save us.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.480
What?

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.520
And let the nightmare
start all over again?

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.760
No. I visited this horror
upon my kingdom.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.880
- I must be the one to finish her.
- Her.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.240
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.960
A beauty so costly?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.840
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.160
I was weak.

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.480
I am sorry.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.560
So, so sorry.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.040
I have always loved you, my Queen.

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.080
And I you.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.160
Keep a memory of me,

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.720
not as a king or a hero,

01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.800
but as a man,

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.960
fallible and flawed.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.360
This is the place.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.840
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.360
Wiglaf, I have no sons,

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.560
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.920
that you shall be king.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.480
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.120
Great friend,
there is something you should know.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.880
Nay! There is nothing I should know.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.040
You are Beowulf.
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.560
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.040
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.360
and get on with our bloody lives!

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.000
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.080
Good.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.040
Beowulf.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.560
It has been a long time.

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.880
Take your damned horn
and leave my land in peace.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.440
Too late, my love.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.800
Odin's swifan balls!

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.160
It's heading for Herot!

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.600
Now!

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.480
Hrothgar.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.240
Come on, come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.720
Damn you!

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.200
I'll have your lizard head on a spike!

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.080
No!

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.160
My Lord!

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.280
No!

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.240
Over here! Attend the Queen.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.440
- Attend the Queen.
- Attend the Queen.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.800
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.440
Let's get you to a healer.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.480
Not this time, old friend.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.240
You are Beowulf.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.720
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.960
Do you hear her?

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.480
I hear nothing.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.400
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.120
- No, my Lord.
- My...

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.480
You killed Grendel's mother
when we were young.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.360
They sing of it.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.400
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.040
Too late.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.920
He was

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360
the bravest of us.

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.320
He was the prince

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.760
of all warriors.

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.920
His name will live forever.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.320
His song shall be sung forever.
