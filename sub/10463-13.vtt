WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:04.980
Oh, this must bring back
some great memories,

00:05.306 --> 00:08.650
chain gangs, lock-downs,
strip searches...

00:10.686 --> 00:13.071
It was sort of a special
place for Kate and me.

00:14.106 --> 00:18.076
Yeah, right now, she's probably
sitting around back East, lonely...

00:18.569 --> 00:20.005
She probably hasn't
made any friends yet.

00:20.029 --> 00:22.999
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, right
now, she's probably...

00:23.023 --> 00:25.290
Well, allowing for the
three-hour time difference,

00:25.315 --> 00:27.443
she's probably eating
spaghetti with a guy,

00:28.495 --> 00:32.216
some prep school billionaire's son, and
they're doing that, that noodle thing.

00:38.964 --> 00:41.318
Or she's studying.
Yeah, she's studying.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.819
I mean, she's really
cracking those books.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.822
Recharge? Your coffee. More?

00:45.846 --> 00:48.190
Oh, yeah. Sure.

00:51.143 --> 00:53.070
Oh, I had an uncle
who was there.

00:54.813 --> 00:56.917
- Really?
- Yeah, mmm-hmm.

00:56.941 --> 00:58.825
Then he must be... He
must be pretty old.

00:59.109 --> 01:01.703
They haven't kept prisoners
there since, like, 1963.

01:01.737 --> 01:03.632
Oh, he worked there,
in the kitchen.

01:03.656 --> 01:04.831
Oh.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.543
What?

01:08.786 --> 01:11.672
You guys didn't think he was,
like, a murderer or something?

01:12.539 --> 01:14.132
Yeah, right.

01:23.258 --> 01:25.352
My mother has shoes like that.

01:35.604 --> 01:38.281
- You have a phone call.
- Me?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.200
You're Will, right?

01:44.071 --> 01:47.290
And you have a Jeep.

01:47.866 --> 01:51.471
What, are you, like, like, some
sort of detective or something?

01:51.495 --> 01:53.171
Hmm, something.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.549
So how fast does it go?

01:55.624 --> 01:59.678
I can, I can take you for
a, for a ride sometime.

02:00.379 --> 02:02.431
Hmm, I've got to work late.

02:03.716 --> 02:07.394
- Rain check?
- Great. Rain check.

02:10.055 --> 02:11.857
Okay.

- Hello?
- Who's that?

02:56.226 --> 02:59.414
- Julia.
- Hey, Julia.

02:59.438 --> 03:00.989
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.625
Well, it's funny.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.128
- You don't look 21.
- Anyone around?

03:05.152 --> 03:08.006
Molly, Terry? I know
it's kind of early.

03:08.030 --> 03:12.177
Well, actually, it's kind of late.
We shut down, babe.

03:12.201 --> 03:14.429
- What? Really?
- Yeah. Really?

03:14.453 --> 03:15.930
They had the hearing already?

03:15.954 --> 03:19.934
They suspended his license, and
he's got to pay some big fine.

03:19.958 --> 03:22.010
Poor old Morgan. Yeah.

03:22.377 --> 03:23.688
I didn't think they would...

03:23.712 --> 03:25.514
This is his third strike.

03:25.756 --> 03:28.558
I've tried calling him.
Maybe his machine's broken.

03:28.759 --> 03:30.435
Mmm, yeah.

03:30.761 --> 03:32.020
Have you talked to him?

03:32.095 --> 03:35.649
Yeah, he owes me 600
bucks, the bastard.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.567
Oh, boy.

03:38.060 --> 03:42.781
You know, he's probably gonna lose the
club, and what a pain in the ass,

03:42.940 --> 03:45.575
because he's not
really that bad a guy.

03:46.443 --> 03:50.122
- I know.
- Yeah, you do know, don't you?

03:52.783 --> 03:54.793
I wish that there
was something...

03:58.664 --> 03:59.840
Is he okay?

04:01.792 --> 04:03.093
No.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.399
"Right and wrong: Early childhood and
the development of a moral code."

04:08.423 --> 04:10.443
Wow, is that your topic?

04:10.467 --> 04:11.977
Maybe. Don't know yet.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.312
Something about early
childhood development.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.482
What is it they say, "Those
who can't do, teach"?

04:17.766 --> 04:20.110
Hey. Come on.

04:22.103 --> 04:23.540
I gotta go.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.907
I've got a meeting
with my committee.

04:27.359 --> 04:29.453
Have you seen my
stupid watch anywhere?

04:30.112 --> 04:31.172
Where did you leave it?

04:31.196 --> 04:32.706
I don't remember.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.583
Look for me.

04:35.284 --> 04:37.002
Maybe check around my desk.

04:39.037 --> 04:42.632
Never mind. In the
medicine cabinet.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.676
Go figure.

04:46.003 --> 04:48.096
Are you gonna be home
later on tonight?

04:48.130 --> 04:49.065
Uh...

04:49.089 --> 04:51.349
I thought I'd stop by, see Owen.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.229
I'm late.

04:57.389 --> 04:58.700
I'll see you later.

04:58.724 --> 04:59.983
Sure.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.220
I think Shelby likes me.

05:19.244 --> 05:21.588
Really, I think it's
a real possibility.

05:22.206 --> 05:24.100
I mean, did you see the way
she threw that Jell-O?

05:24.124 --> 05:27.010
Whew. Perfect aim. She
got me right in my ear.

05:29.254 --> 05:30.847
Get out of the jeep, Will.

05:31.256 --> 05:32.650
- What?
- Just get out.

05:32.674 --> 05:34.319
Get out, we're close
to your house.

05:34.343 --> 05:35.570
We're, like, two
miles from my house.

05:35.594 --> 05:37.229
It's good exercise.

05:37.930 --> 05:40.575
Hey, it's that girl,
that coffee girl...

05:40.599 --> 05:41.816
Jill.

05:42.768 --> 05:45.362
Well, this has been a
terrific friendship.

05:45.395 --> 05:47.582
You're just going to blow me off now?
Is that what's going on?

05:47.606 --> 05:49.115
Sure.

05:56.448 --> 05:59.376
Hey. You need a ride?

06:01.453 --> 06:02.963
It depends on where
you're going.

06:03.246 --> 06:08.468
Uh, well, home was my original
plan, but I'm open to suggestions.

06:14.383 --> 06:16.768
So how fast did you say
this thing could go?

06:24.017 --> 06:25.735
Hi, Morgan.

06:32.275 --> 06:34.452
I stopped by the club today,

06:34.528 --> 06:39.082
and Loren told me about them
suspending your liquor license.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.583
I'm sorry.

06:41.118 --> 06:44.212
I know you're mad at me, and you
should be, because it's my fault,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.934
and I know that I lied about my
age, but that was the only thing.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.602
I mean, that's the only
thing that I lied about.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.970
- The rest of it was...
- Forget it, all right?

06:53.046 --> 06:55.849
I heard about the fine, so I...

06:57.009 --> 07:00.312
It's not everything. I can get more.
I thought it would help.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.074
My family, we have this
checkbook for emergencies,

07:03.098 --> 07:05.525
and I thought this was
an emergency, so...

07:06.518 --> 07:07.944
Keep your money.

07:09.479 --> 07:12.750
Come on, if you pay off the fine, then
maybe you can open the club again.

07:12.774 --> 07:14.127
It's a little late
for that, Julia.

07:14.151 --> 07:15.910
No, it's not. Why
is it too late?

07:20.574 --> 07:23.511
Because your stupid little cheque
for $250 doesn't mean anything.

07:23.535 --> 07:25.596
Morgan, please, I
have to do something.

07:25.620 --> 07:26.838
Then get out of here.

07:35.047 --> 07:38.308
Yeah, that's right. I'm drunk.

07:40.969 --> 07:43.239
So your sister is coming the
day after tomorrow, huh?

07:43.263 --> 07:44.898
Mmm-hmm.

07:45.182 --> 07:47.817
When was the last time you and Meg
got to spend any time together?

07:47.893 --> 07:51.696
I went home for a few days last Christmas.
That doesn't really count.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.282
Thank you. Thank you.

07:55.025 --> 07:57.325
I guess if you were there
for longer than a week,

07:57.418 --> 07:59.603
you'd get to spend some
real quality time, huh?

08:01.198 --> 08:02.499
You found the ticket.

08:05.202 --> 08:08.421
Meg sent it. She wants me
to come home for a while.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.382
Why are you running away?

08:11.041 --> 08:12.634
I'm not running away.

08:15.170 --> 08:20.109
I'm not. I can work on my dissertation
there and spend some time with my family.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.986
I thought your family
drove you crazy.

08:22.010 --> 08:25.573
I mean, there's not one story that you tell about
them that doesn't end with "Can you believe that?"

08:25.597 --> 08:27.649
I need a change, Charlie.

08:28.517 --> 08:31.069
You're going home because
you can't have kids.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.239
My family will take care of me.

08:36.566 --> 08:39.837
- So would I.
- I wouldn't ask you to.

08:39.861 --> 08:40.797
I'm offering.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.039
Look, Charlie, we were just getting
good at this friends stuff.

08:44.408 --> 08:46.543
I don't want to get
that screwed up.

08:47.953 --> 08:50.588
Look, I haven't even
decided if I'm going.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.218
Okay.

08:58.630 --> 09:01.391
I had chem lab after
you last semester.

09:01.716 --> 09:03.476
I sat at your table.

09:04.636 --> 09:06.813
You dripped your
name on it in acid.

09:07.222 --> 09:08.857
Oh, right.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.359
Yeah, I didn't learn too
much in that class.

09:11.935 --> 09:13.278
Me neither.

09:20.527 --> 09:24.873
Rust is, is a compound
called iron oxide.

09:54.269 --> 09:55.403
Just relax.

09:57.772 --> 09:59.240
It's okay.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.409
What?

10:02.861 --> 10:04.120
Whatever.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.803
- Wait a second.
- What?

10:21.129 --> 10:23.765
- I don't have anything.
- What?

10:23.882 --> 10:25.809
I didn't bring anything.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.313
Oh.

10:32.974 --> 10:36.194
Um, well, rain check?

10:38.355 --> 10:40.698
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:49.074 --> 10:51.677
I'm always prepared.
I'm over-prepared.

10:51.701 --> 10:53.503
How come this one time?

10:54.287 --> 10:56.140
It's amazing.

10:56.164 --> 10:59.092
You know, it's, It's too good.
I'm gonna get hit by a bus.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.636
Oh, positive attitude, Bay.

11:01.878 --> 11:05.223
What, what am I thinking? I
don't even know this girl.

11:05.257 --> 11:08.569
I mean, we, like, swapped spit.
I've never even been in her house.

11:08.593 --> 11:09.737
I don't even know
where she lives.

11:09.761 --> 11:10.780
She lives near The Presidio.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.022
She's got a little sister who knows
my little sister. She's cute.

11:13.056 --> 11:14.450
She's cute.

11:14.474 --> 11:18.152
She likes me. She wants to.
She wants to.

11:18.561 --> 11:21.290
I mean, I can get this whole
virginity thing done with.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.782
So what's the question here?

11:23.942 --> 11:25.044
Am I ready?

11:25.068 --> 11:26.462
You were ready with Kate.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.381
That's different. That's different.
I loved Kate.

11:28.405 --> 11:30.248
Bay, nobody says you
have to marry the girl.

11:35.787 --> 11:38.131
So give me some good
hometown gossip.

11:38.206 --> 11:42.186
Who's engaged, who's divorced, who's
cheating on their income taxes.

11:42.210 --> 11:46.264
Well, you're gonna find out soon enough.
You're on everybody's invite list,

11:46.965 --> 11:50.685
and Carl's taken your picture and
showing it to the guys at the ad firm.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.855
Productivity has fallen
off, oh, about 25%.

11:54.055 --> 11:57.483
Men, huh? Well, you
know, Charlie, right?

12:03.398 --> 12:07.753
So, if I go to the bathroom, are you
guys gonna talk about me behind my back?

12:07.777 --> 12:09.454
- Are you kidding?
- Absolutely.

12:17.746 --> 12:20.298
Kirsten says you've been
wonderful through all this...

12:20.832 --> 12:21.934
She does?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.395
And I'm grateful to you
too, Charlie, I really am,

12:24.419 --> 12:28.399
for being there for my sister when she
needed you and for figuring out that

12:28.423 --> 12:30.401
that's what you guys
were meant to be:

12:30.425 --> 12:31.934
Friends.

12:32.677 --> 12:35.855
Sometimes I think it takes a
while to realize that, huh?

12:39.976 --> 12:42.278
Um, I've got a crowbar.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.075
Well, not on me.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.619
What you looking for?

12:49.819 --> 12:52.121
Uh, <i>Canterbury Tales.</i>

12:52.155 --> 12:54.916
Oh, well, here, you
can borrow mine.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.794
- I just came from English.
- Hmm.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.047
Okay, now,

13:01.331 --> 13:03.726
I turned down the pages
on the dirty parts.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.176
Shh.

13:05.627 --> 13:07.595
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:16.513 --> 13:20.191
That's... That's a nice top.

13:22.894 --> 13:24.737
You know, I'm not
doing anything later.

13:26.356 --> 13:27.708
Oh, yeah?

13:27.732 --> 13:29.742
Yeah. No one's gonna be around.

13:30.068 --> 13:32.004
My dad, he's away, and
my mom works nights,

13:32.028 --> 13:37.083
and my brother, he won these tickets off the
radio for some stupid rodeo or something.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.969
So he's gonna take
the other kids.

13:38.993 --> 13:40.211
Ah.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.380
So no one's going to be around.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.467
You could come over about 8:00.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.096
Great. Sure, 8:00.

13:50.588 --> 13:52.056
Okay.

13:52.424 --> 13:54.684
Um, 667 Presidio...

13:54.843 --> 13:57.729
Like 666, just one more.

13:58.179 --> 13:59.323
One more. Okay.

13:59.347 --> 14:02.358
Oh, and I think you're late.

14:18.366 --> 14:19.709
Julia.

14:21.578 --> 14:22.920
Julia!

14:23.455 --> 14:24.922
What's going on, Claud?

14:25.498 --> 14:28.092
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

14:28.126 --> 14:29.886
Well, do you, like,
know where she is?

14:30.044 --> 14:31.220
Nope.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.190
Do you know when
she's coming back?

14:33.214 --> 14:34.358
Negatory.

14:34.382 --> 14:35.526
Are you sure?

14:35.550 --> 14:38.770
Because... I really
need to talk to her.

14:39.304 --> 14:41.564
What is this, Claud? Some
big emergency or something?

14:43.141 --> 14:46.027
Well, yeah, it is.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.531
I just got my period.

14:52.984 --> 14:54.118
Oh.

14:56.988 --> 14:59.624
Okay. What have we got here?

14:59.824 --> 15:02.136
These look good. Let's
get out of here.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.628
Bailey.

15:04.579 --> 15:06.297
These are tampons.

15:06.414 --> 15:08.091
Super plus.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.885
Jeez.

15:11.503 --> 15:13.387
There sure are a lot
to choose from.

15:13.797 --> 15:17.141
These have wings. Wings?

15:18.134 --> 15:19.435
What's that about, huh?

15:19.552 --> 15:21.562
Uh, I don't think these
are right either.

15:22.972 --> 15:26.901
Scented or unscented?

15:27.018 --> 15:28.402
Which is better?

15:29.020 --> 15:30.613
You think I would know this?

15:30.855 --> 15:32.406
It's okay, Bay.

15:32.774 --> 15:35.284
Look, why don't you
just give me a minute?

15:35.360 --> 15:37.120
I mean, I can read
the boxes too.

15:37.278 --> 15:38.871
I'll figure it out.

15:38.905 --> 15:39.924
Are you sure?

15:39.948 --> 15:41.958
- Yeah.
- Great.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.918
I'll just be...

16:04.430 --> 16:06.315
What the hell are
you doing in here?

16:06.349 --> 16:08.609
Oh, um, the landlady let me in.

16:08.685 --> 16:10.788
I said I was your sister.
Pretty gullible, huh?

16:10.812 --> 16:12.697
Yeah, yeah, you are a pretty
good liar, aren't you?

16:14.274 --> 16:16.159
I could make you
dinner if you want.

16:16.693 --> 16:17.952
What did you do?

16:18.194 --> 16:20.913
You were drinking, so I...

16:21.322 --> 16:22.665
You spilled out my booze?

16:24.492 --> 16:27.137
Get out of here, just get
the hell out of here.

16:27.161 --> 16:28.754
- I'm trying to help you.
- Really?

16:28.830 --> 16:31.132
What, you think you're
gonna come over here

16:31.207 --> 16:34.645
and spill out my booze, make me dinner, and
that's gonna make everything all right?

16:34.669 --> 16:36.856
- I'm trying.
- Well, stop trying!

16:36.880 --> 16:39.807
You're just a stupid kid. You don't
know what the hell you're doing.

16:41.426 --> 16:43.895
Jeez, 15...

16:44.846 --> 16:46.856
Fifteen years old.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.242
I could've slept with you.

16:48.266 --> 16:51.527
- I said I was sorry. -Yeah? So what?
You think that counts for crap?

16:52.478 --> 16:55.406
You know, you pretend to be
grown up, but you're not.

16:55.940 --> 17:01.245
You're just a selfish little girl who likes
to play games and ruin other people's lives,

17:01.905 --> 17:04.040
and you don't know when to stop!

17:04.406 --> 17:06.626
Hey, you really want
to help me out?

17:07.035 --> 17:08.336
All right.

17:12.415 --> 17:14.300
There, clean that up.
That'll make things better.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.061
How could you
forget your wallet?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.700
God, Joe just keeps
that thing going?

17:29.724 --> 17:31.275
Isn't that kind
of a fire hazard?

17:34.145 --> 17:35.863
I called ahead.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.450
Charlie.

17:43.112 --> 17:44.664
I don't want to be your friend.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.633
What?

17:45.657 --> 17:47.583
I mean, just your friend.

17:48.743 --> 17:50.336
It's not enough.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.265
We can tell each other that that's
what we are, but we're not.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.799
We're more than that.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.302
So...

17:58.586 --> 18:00.096
Let's think big.

18:02.006 --> 18:03.432
Big?

18:06.135 --> 18:07.812
Let's think huge.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.861
Let's get married. I
want to marry you.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.240
I want you to marry me, I want
us to be married to each other.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.996
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.

18:25.446 --> 18:29.542
I... I... I'm having
trouble breathing.

18:30.201 --> 18:34.422
I just... have to... sit.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.804
Should I... I mean, do you
want me to go on? Okay.

18:42.005 --> 18:44.056
I've thought a lot about this.

18:44.298 --> 18:48.394
Well, okay, not a lot in actual terms of time,
but I've thought very intensely about it.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.273
Are you sure you're okay?

18:52.515 --> 18:54.400
Okay, so follow my logic here.

18:55.810 --> 18:58.122
Everything in your life seems
to be up in the air, right?

18:58.146 --> 19:00.239
So let's, let's pin this
one thing down: us.

19:00.732 --> 19:03.200
Let's say that we're gonna
be together forever,

19:04.318 --> 19:06.162
and, and... And I love you.

19:06.821 --> 19:10.624
I'm... I'm in love with you. I want to
spend the rest of my life with you.

19:12.577 --> 19:14.378
I should've said that first.

19:15.496 --> 19:16.839
Damn.

19:20.752 --> 19:23.763
Forget all the rest. That,
that's what it comes down to.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.851
What do you say?

19:48.488 --> 19:49.622
What?

19:57.872 --> 19:59.215
Well, don't you want to...

19:59.874 --> 20:01.717
Yeah. Yes.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.307
- Ow! Ow!
- What? What?

20:40.331 --> 20:42.466
- You're on my hair.
- Oh, sorry.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.427
- Sorry.
- Okay.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.933
Wait. Wait. Just slow down.

20:51.425 --> 20:52.986
- Right.
- Okay.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.395
Okay.

21:00.309 --> 21:02.027
Tell me what's good.

21:02.979 --> 21:05.030
This is good.

21:16.159 --> 21:18.220
Should I... I mean, is it...

21:18.244 --> 21:19.795
It's okay.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.673
I'll show you.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.267
So, do you love me?

21:34.010 --> 21:35.352
Uh-huh.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.606
"Yes" would make me feel better.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.733
Yes.

21:41.392 --> 21:43.027
Well, then?

21:43.895 --> 21:45.571
Is that a good enough reason?

21:46.814 --> 21:48.324
Maybe.

21:49.901 --> 21:52.036
Let's just do it.

21:52.862 --> 21:54.580
It'll never work, you know.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.500
- It could.
- It might.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.878
- We'd make it work.
- Okay.

22:02.914 --> 22:04.131
What?

22:06.626 --> 22:10.012
- Yes.
- Yes?

22:20.473 --> 22:22.816
For God's sake, Claud, I
don't have time for this.

22:23.059 --> 22:25.319
You think you're gonna miss school
every time you get your period?

22:26.020 --> 22:27.947
I just don't feel like going.

22:28.230 --> 22:30.626
- I'm moody.
- You're moody all the time.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.951
Problem?

22:32.401 --> 22:34.379
Claudia's not going to school.
She got her period.

22:34.403 --> 22:36.006
So? It's her first time.
She's nervous.

22:36.030 --> 22:39.593
I'm not nervous. I just,
I don't feel like going.

22:39.617 --> 22:41.470
- What's going on?
- Claudia's period.

22:41.494 --> 22:45.673
Why don't you just invite the neighbors over
and we can all talk about it? Do you mind?

22:45.790 --> 22:47.643
Are you worried about having
an accident or something?

22:47.667 --> 22:48.685
She's afraid of spilling.

22:48.709 --> 22:49.885
Staining.

22:50.419 --> 22:51.887
I'm going to die.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.181
Do you have any idea
what wings are?

22:54.215 --> 22:55.651
Guys just don't get it.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.852
It's okay, though. They
have to shave every day.

23:00.221 --> 23:03.524
You guys, this is a big deal.
I mean, it's special.

23:03.766 --> 23:06.151
Claudia's, like, actually
becoming a woman.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.445
Oh, great.

23:10.731 --> 23:13.742
- Do I look different to you?
- Is that a zit?

23:14.777 --> 23:16.161
Forget it.

23:16.737 --> 23:20.708
So, you and Jill,
what's the update?

23:20.950 --> 23:23.168
Date number two a
happening thing?

23:24.412 --> 23:25.754
I guess.

23:26.747 --> 23:29.049
She didn't drop you?
It's a new record.

23:30.501 --> 23:31.436
I slept with her.

23:31.460 --> 23:32.896
What do you mean,
you slept with her?

23:32.920 --> 23:35.180
"You fell asleep in the same bed
beside her" you slept with her?

23:35.214 --> 23:36.557
I had sex with her.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.603
She just wanted to,
and I wanted to.

23:41.762 --> 23:43.439
That's usually the
way it happens.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.524
So?

23:46.100 --> 23:47.318
Was it good?

23:47.518 --> 23:50.237
It was weird. You know, I
mean, I hardly even know her.

23:50.438 --> 23:52.489
Well, you know her
pretty well now.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.868
But, I mean, it's not like we,
we dated or anything, you know?

23:55.901 --> 23:59.455
- We just...
- Slept together.

24:02.033 --> 24:03.334
Yeah.

24:05.161 --> 24:07.129
He's drinking, Loren.

24:07.329 --> 24:11.518
You should've seen him. He's, like, this complete
mess, and every time I see him, it just gets worse...

24:11.542 --> 24:12.769
Yeah, it's real bad.

24:12.793 --> 24:16.023
And it's my fault. I did this to him,
and I don't know how to make it better.

24:16.047 --> 24:17.858
I don't know how
to make him stop.

24:17.882 --> 24:19.693
You can't make him stop.

24:19.717 --> 24:23.395
- I have to.
- Just walk away.

24:24.972 --> 24:27.534
I can't, not after what I did.

24:27.558 --> 24:29.453
What you did? What did you do?

24:29.477 --> 24:32.988
Huh? Did you pour him a drink,
wave it under his nose, huh?

24:33.022 --> 24:34.041
No.

24:34.065 --> 24:35.949
Then how is this your fault?

24:36.400 --> 24:39.620
- Come on.
- What? Wha...

24:40.029 --> 24:42.090
What, you mean,
that fake ID thing?

24:42.114 --> 24:43.999
Oh, man, come on.

24:44.158 --> 24:45.542
Get over it, honey.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.305
That was not the end
of the world, okay?

24:48.329 --> 24:51.298
And if he's acting like it is,
then it ain't your problem.

24:51.832 --> 24:54.760
You really thought he was
drinking because of you, huh?

24:55.127 --> 24:57.304
Yeah, right. Uh-uh.

24:57.505 --> 24:59.431
All he needed was an excuse.

24:59.590 --> 25:01.016
That's it.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.269
Oh, sweetheart,

25:04.720 --> 25:06.563
you're awfully
young, aren't you?

25:07.640 --> 25:12.736
Well, you just got yourself a little
life lesson, kiddo, on the house.

25:24.448 --> 25:25.916
Come in.

25:27.409 --> 25:28.919
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:28.994 --> 25:31.098
Wow, your pants are
looking a little short.

25:31.122 --> 25:34.017
I know. Last time I put
them on, they were fine.

25:34.041 --> 25:35.717
Come here.

25:36.877 --> 25:39.012
I can take them down
a little for you.

25:39.505 --> 25:43.350
- You want me to do that?
- Yeah. Thanks.

25:45.886 --> 25:48.313
Is everything always
gonna be this fast?

25:49.473 --> 25:52.317
- Like what?
- Like...

25:53.936 --> 25:56.572
I'm gonna have my period
once a month now...

25:57.022 --> 26:00.033
For, like, years and
years, 40 years,

26:00.234 --> 26:03.328
480 times, 2400 days,

26:04.488 --> 26:05.956
and I can't stop it.

26:07.616 --> 26:09.251
No, you can't.

26:11.453 --> 26:14.131
I don't feel like I'm
becoming a woman.

26:14.707 --> 26:19.011
I mean, hey, I still like playing
with dolls and crayons sometimes...

26:19.712 --> 26:22.264
Even though watercolors
are better,

26:22.756 --> 26:25.934
and sometimes, I, I watch
<i>Sesame Street</i> with Owen...

26:27.636 --> 26:29.239
And it still makes me laugh.

26:29.263 --> 26:30.323
Yeah?

26:30.347 --> 26:32.858
- Well, Grover is really funny.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:34.185 --> 26:37.696
Sometimes, do you kind
of wish you could

26:37.813 --> 26:40.532
sort of freeze the age you're
at and just stay there?

26:43.068 --> 26:44.536
Sometimes.

26:44.570 --> 26:47.206
Or maybe things just get
easier when you get older.

26:49.158 --> 26:50.542
Do they get easier?

26:51.243 --> 26:54.046
Sure. Sure, they do.

26:55.039 --> 26:58.133
Look, I know it seems like things
are going real fast right now.

26:58.167 --> 27:02.221
You know, all these changes,
but they'll slow down, really.

27:03.672 --> 27:07.309
Last week, I was just a kid,
and now I have my period.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.063
I think I saw a gray hair.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.566
You look the same to me.

27:20.189 --> 27:21.365
You're kidding.

27:21.857 --> 27:25.170
No. I mean, we
thought about it...

27:25.194 --> 27:26.620
Well...

27:27.655 --> 27:29.957
Come on, Megs. I want
you to be happy for me.

27:30.157 --> 27:33.794
I should... I should
just stay out of this.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.965
Okay, good.

27:41.669 --> 27:46.942
You can't actually think that this is a good
idea, to rush into something like this.

27:46.966 --> 27:47.901
Meg, stop.

27:47.925 --> 27:49.736
No, come on, not with
your guys, your history.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.364
Hey, you know what? That is
between us, and it's behind us,

27:52.388 --> 27:54.690
and it's really not open for
public discussion, Meg.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.244
All that stuff with... What's her name?
That girl, Rebecca,

27:57.268 --> 27:58.819
all that's just forgotten?

27:59.061 --> 28:00.580
What, do you tell
her everything?

28:00.604 --> 28:02.281
- I'm her sister.
- Meg.

28:03.065 --> 28:06.785
I, I don't know what you're doing.
Honestly, I...

28:08.570 --> 28:13.625
Charlie, I barely know
you, and I could be wrong,

28:14.368 --> 28:17.430
but I just hope you're not the kind of
guy that would ask someone to marry him

28:17.454 --> 28:20.299
because you don't like the
idea of being walked out on.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.936
I know that that's
not true, Meg.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.649
You haven't had one single month
of a stable relationship,

28:27.673 --> 28:31.111
and now he is asking you to do something
that s supposed to be forever.

28:31.135 --> 28:33.154
Well, I'm sorry, but nothing
I've heard about this guy

28:33.178 --> 28:35.615
leads me to believe he has any
idea of what "forever" even means.

28:35.639 --> 28:36.574
Meg, shut up!

28:36.598 --> 28:38.734
Where do you get off, lady? God!

28:39.893 --> 28:43.405
You don't know a damn thing about me
or about how we feel about each other,

28:43.522 --> 28:45.949
and you know what, I think you should
just get the hell out of here!

28:57.453 --> 28:59.139
Think we'll have time
to make the movie?

28:59.163 --> 29:00.140
Yeah, I think so.

29:00.164 --> 29:01.391
You guys have a good night.

29:01.415 --> 29:02.966
Good night.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.856
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.306
I was just closing up.

29:09.590 --> 29:11.735
You want some coffee? I just
turned the machine off.

29:11.759 --> 29:13.644
No, thanks, I'm okay.

29:18.557 --> 29:22.027
So... So you like
working in this place?

29:22.227 --> 29:23.904
Hmm, it's a job.

29:25.689 --> 29:30.503
I'd bet you get to meet a lot of interesting
characters working in a place like this.

29:30.527 --> 29:33.830
Lots of poets, musicians...

29:34.156 --> 29:36.166
Hmm, not really.

29:38.702 --> 29:43.131
Part-time jobs, huh? God,
I've had millions of them.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.512
So... So what does your dad do?

29:49.129 --> 29:50.273
Why?

29:50.297 --> 29:51.932
I'm just curious.

29:52.716 --> 29:54.726
In the military.

29:56.804 --> 29:57.980
Military.

30:03.727 --> 30:05.070
Big family?

30:05.354 --> 30:07.248
Mmm-hmm, there are five of us.

30:07.272 --> 30:10.283
No kidding? That's, me too.

30:10.859 --> 30:14.255
There's... There's five of us too.
That is, that is so funny.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.707
So we're both, like,
from big families.

30:17.908 --> 30:20.261
Lots of crazy stuff happens
in big families, huh?

30:20.285 --> 30:21.753
Lots of stories.

30:23.372 --> 30:24.965
Lots of stories.

30:29.002 --> 30:31.096
You want to go somewhere?

30:32.464 --> 30:33.932
We could.

30:34.717 --> 30:37.561
Or we could just stay here.

30:39.847 --> 30:40.949
Here?

30:40.973 --> 30:42.858
Mmm-hmm.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.672
Listen, Kirsten...

31:07.249 --> 31:09.217
Everything your
sister said is true.

31:09.793 --> 31:12.272
We have had sort of a rocky
time together, and...

31:12.296 --> 31:15.567
And I don't have the greatest history, and we
didn't spend much time thinking about this,

31:15.591 --> 31:17.110
but so what?

31:17.134 --> 31:19.978
It doesn't mean that she added it
all up and found the right answer.

31:21.054 --> 31:24.357
Yeah, but we're kind of jumping off
a cliff with our eyes closed here.

31:25.309 --> 31:26.818
My eyes aren't closed.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.071
Are yours? Really?

31:30.689 --> 31:31.990
Maybe.

31:34.276 --> 31:35.452
A little.

31:38.071 --> 31:39.372
I'm sorry.

31:39.782 --> 31:42.218
Everything you say makes
me feel so wonderful,

31:42.242 --> 31:45.013
and I want it to be the way you say
it's gonna be, but I don't know.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.306
I mean, I'm...

31:46.330 --> 31:47.724
I'm confused, I...

31:47.748 --> 31:49.883
That's okay. Look...

31:50.834 --> 31:53.512
I can handle some
indecision on your part.

31:53.921 --> 31:57.140
We'll just... We'll
just get through it.

32:01.762 --> 32:03.647
We shouldn't get
married, Charlie.

32:09.645 --> 32:11.655
I'm just...

32:14.441 --> 32:15.668
I'm not at a point right now

32:15.692 --> 32:18.328
where I should be making
any rash decisions.

32:20.197 --> 32:22.541
My sister's right
about that at least.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.091
I shouldn't have said yes.

32:32.501 --> 32:35.053
I made a mistake, and I'm sorry.

32:41.510 --> 32:43.186
Look...

32:44.763 --> 32:50.861
I asked you to do something romantic
and rash and completely on faith,

32:51.979 --> 32:55.574
and actually, I couldn't
believe it when you said yes.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.545
I guess I thought
that you wouldn't,

32:58.569 --> 33:00.912
and I'm not surprised
that you won't,

33:01.446 --> 33:03.123
but...

33:06.910 --> 33:08.253
But?

33:11.164 --> 33:13.466
But it wouldn't have
been a mistake.

33:19.548 --> 33:22.360
- Guess who?
- Hey.

33:22.384 --> 33:25.645
<i>- Canterbury Tales...</i>
<i>- Silas Marner.</i>

33:25.721 --> 33:27.480
We're not up to that yet.

33:29.391 --> 33:31.953
So, I never asked you.
How, um...

33:31.977 --> 33:33.945
How did your family
like that rodeo?

33:34.187 --> 33:35.822
Oh, you know.

33:36.106 --> 33:40.118
Oh, hey, they're gonna go to that
flea market up in Marin on Saturday,

33:40.944 --> 33:42.954
so if you want to come by...

33:43.739 --> 33:47.250
Uh, I don't... I'm not sure.

33:47.910 --> 33:50.128
Okay, how about Sunday?

33:50.871 --> 33:52.390
Uh, I don't know.

33:52.414 --> 33:54.007
Sunday...

33:55.334 --> 33:56.885
Oh.

33:57.461 --> 33:58.637
I just...

33:59.630 --> 34:01.848
You don't want to
see me anymore.

34:02.883 --> 34:04.152
What?

34:04.176 --> 34:05.987
I can hear it in your voice.

34:06.011 --> 34:09.105
- No, no, look...
- You're not having any fun.

34:11.099 --> 34:12.452
I'm still having fun.

34:12.476 --> 34:16.905
It's just that... It seems like...
every time we see each other,

34:17.898 --> 34:20.324
it's like we only do one thing.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.619
You know, I mean, it's...
That's, like, all we do.

34:24.029 --> 34:25.789
- You don't like sex?
- No, I...

34:26.739 --> 34:28.250
I think sex is...

34:28.659 --> 34:31.971
Actually, I think it's pretty
underrated, as far as I can tell.

34:31.995 --> 34:35.966
Sex is amazing. I just
wish we had, like...

34:36.416 --> 34:40.219
Like, talked more or something,
or done something together.

34:41.630 --> 34:45.100
You know, I just... I mean, you've
never even asked anything about me.

34:47.344 --> 34:48.687
See...

34:50.138 --> 34:53.065
I think about you, and
I want to have sex,

34:53.433 --> 34:54.859
but now...

34:55.643 --> 34:58.863
I don't know, I just feel... I
feel bad about it, because...

35:00.607 --> 35:03.243
I don't know, it just...
It doesn't feel...

35:03.902 --> 35:08.248
It just feels like kind of...
Like kind of nothing.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.557
It's weird.

35:31.096 --> 35:32.605
I had...

35:34.057 --> 35:37.745
I had this boyfriend,
like, about a year ago,

35:37.769 --> 35:38.987
and...

35:40.397 --> 35:44.534
...after we broke up, the thing
he said he missed most about me

35:45.527 --> 35:47.203
was the sex.

35:49.072 --> 35:50.758
I know that there
are prettier girls,

35:50.782 --> 35:52.709
and I know there
are smarter girls,

35:53.368 --> 35:56.254
but I'm... I'm good
at the sex part.

35:56.913 --> 35:59.841
It's the one thing I know that
guys will be interested in.

36:02.836 --> 36:05.189
I don't do this with everyone
if that's what you're thinking.

36:05.213 --> 36:06.765
No, I wasn't.

36:07.007 --> 36:08.308
I wasn't.

36:09.426 --> 36:12.280
It's not like I made you do
something you didn't want to do.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.322
I know.

36:13.346 --> 36:15.658
And I don't remember you

36:15.682 --> 36:19.069
suggesting we go to a movie
or do something else instead.

36:20.729 --> 36:21.706
I know.

36:21.730 --> 36:24.657
You didn't seem to mind
when we were doing it.

36:24.941 --> 36:26.785
You kept coming back for more.

36:27.736 --> 36:29.496
"Kind of nothing."

36:33.492 --> 36:35.001
Wow.

36:35.869 --> 36:37.253
Jill...

36:44.377 --> 36:46.054
Morgan.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.850
Honey, I'll be right back, okay?

36:56.389 --> 36:58.274
I don't want you to talk.
Just listen, okay?

36:58.558 --> 37:00.369
Julia, I really don't
want to hear anything.

37:00.393 --> 37:02.987
You know what, Morgan?
Everybody has bad breaks...

37:03.563 --> 37:04.989
Even me.

37:05.232 --> 37:08.326
And you might think that 15 is
too young to know anything,

37:08.568 --> 37:11.121
but I know this from
personal experience:

37:11.988 --> 37:15.083
When something really awful happens
to you, you have two choices.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.929
You can decide to
let it mess you up,

37:17.953 --> 37:21.172
or you can decide not to let it
mess you up. It's up to you,

37:21.289 --> 37:23.967
and no one can help you if
you don't want to be helped.

37:25.043 --> 37:28.221
And I may be just some
stupid kid, but you're not,

37:28.505 --> 37:30.348
and it's really time
for you to grow up...

37:36.096 --> 37:38.022
So I guess...

37:38.431 --> 37:42.026
I guess I just really hope that you
decide to take care of yourself.

37:58.201 --> 38:00.712
Hey. How's it going?

38:01.621 --> 38:03.214
Okay.

38:04.207 --> 38:05.717
So how's business?

38:06.334 --> 38:07.594
Um...

38:08.086 --> 38:10.273
Some lady found a bug
in her bear claw.

38:10.297 --> 38:11.473
Kind of freaked out.

38:12.883 --> 38:14.517
That was sort of interesting.

38:15.468 --> 38:16.811
I'm sorry I missed it.

38:17.721 --> 38:19.272
Yeah, well...

38:24.686 --> 38:26.446
So, um...

38:27.689 --> 38:30.042
So, what time do
you get off work?

38:30.066 --> 38:32.744
- Why?
- I don't know.

38:33.987 --> 38:37.749
I was... I was thinking
that maybe you'd like to...

38:38.200 --> 38:41.002
Get together, do
something, see a movie.

38:42.579 --> 38:44.881
- Movie?
- Yeah.

38:45.373 --> 38:49.761
And then afterwards, we could... I
don't know, get a burger or something.

38:50.212 --> 38:52.347
Well, you're not a
vegetarian, are you?

38:53.924 --> 38:55.475
Me neither.

38:57.886 --> 38:59.197
Dinner and a movie, huh?

38:59.221 --> 39:02.774
Uh, well, actually,
a movie and dinner,

39:02.933 --> 39:05.568
if you're being
chronologically accurate.

39:07.812 --> 39:09.531
I'd like to go on a
date with you...

39:12.484 --> 39:14.045
Because...

39:14.069 --> 39:18.248
We kind of started this whole thing
a little backwards, you know?

39:20.867 --> 39:22.126
So?

39:25.789 --> 39:27.298
Okay.

39:28.291 --> 39:29.634
I'd like that.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.812
Good.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.888
Uh, I get off at 6:00.

39:33.922 --> 39:36.516
Okay. Okay, I'll...

39:38.260 --> 39:41.729
I'll pick you up at 6:00. Okay.

39:43.473 --> 39:44.691
Oh.

39:45.934 --> 39:48.412
I should, I should
probably warn you, though.

39:48.436 --> 39:50.905
I generally don't kiss
on the first date.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.782
I'm not that kind of guy.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.718
Too bad the dog has to die.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.512
Aren't there puppies
or something?

40:14.754 --> 40:16.180
Not really the same thing.

40:16.965 --> 40:19.225
So how you feeling? Any cramps?

40:19.509 --> 40:20.685
Mmm-mmm.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.856
Listen, I've got an idea.

40:25.015 --> 40:27.984
How about you come upstairs and
sleep in my bed with me tonight?

40:28.727 --> 40:29.829
What?

40:29.853 --> 40:33.740
I could make popcorn, and I could read
<i>Charlotte's Web</i> to you like I used to.

40:34.357 --> 40:36.326
You really want to do that?
How come?

40:37.360 --> 40:40.163
I thought you were way too
old to share a room anymore.

40:41.364 --> 40:43.374
Who said that?

40:43.783 --> 40:45.376
I'm not too old.

40:47.787 --> 40:49.297
Come on.

40:55.962 --> 40:57.305
Hey.

40:57.339 --> 40:58.723
Hey.

41:00.842 --> 41:02.518
You look like
you've been crying.

41:02.635 --> 41:04.896
Only for about the
last 24 hours, yeah.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.608
Want to come in?

41:08.975 --> 41:10.443
No.

41:11.269 --> 41:14.656
So you came all the way over here
just to stand in the doorway?

41:18.193 --> 41:19.869
I don't know.

41:21.071 --> 41:23.247
I don't know what to do.

41:23.281 --> 41:27.877
I've been thinking about
this over and over and over.

41:29.329 --> 41:31.673
I mean, I can't marry
you, because...

41:32.123 --> 41:33.809
Well, we've been through that.

41:33.833 --> 41:37.261
And I can't go back to
Chicago, because...

41:37.504 --> 41:38.930
You're right.

41:39.089 --> 41:41.599
I would be kind of running away,

41:43.009 --> 41:46.396
but I can't just stay
where I am, because...

41:47.263 --> 41:49.023
I do need to make a change.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.195
Which leaves me...

41:54.521 --> 41:56.614
Pretty much with no options.

41:57.273 --> 41:58.950
That's not true.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.202
Name one.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.705
Move in here with me.

42:06.533 --> 42:07.750
Charlie...

42:07.867 --> 42:09.794
You need a change of scenery?
You got it.

42:10.829 --> 42:13.256
You'd be surrounded by
people who care about you.

42:13.456 --> 42:15.383
You could work on your
dissertation here.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.386
I could put a desk
in my bedroom, or...

42:19.295 --> 42:22.557
Hey, I could convert
the attic, and...

42:25.552 --> 42:27.437
What?

42:28.263 --> 42:29.772
Wow.

42:31.099 --> 42:32.442
Just...

42:35.770 --> 42:37.530
Wow, that's an amazing offer.

42:40.984 --> 42:43.035
But I don't know. I'm...

42:43.236 --> 42:47.832
I mean, what do you need this for?
I'm, like, this basket case right now.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.670
This wasn't the way things
were meant to work out.

42:53.413 --> 42:55.173
See, I, I disagree.

42:56.291 --> 42:58.384
I really disagree.

42:59.377 --> 43:01.095
Kirsten,

43:01.754 --> 43:05.475
take it from me, things never work out
the way you think they're going to.

It doesn't mean that
it's not meant to be.

43:12.098 --> 43:13.524

43:13.641 --> 43:17.445

and I mean, how did this happen to me?
I, I have four of them.

43:28.490 --> 43:30.333
And I love you.

43:32.243 --> 43:34.170
So why don't you share mine?
