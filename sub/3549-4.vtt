WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:03.074
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:03.074 --> 00:06.337
BREE'S HUSBAND FELT REJECTED.
 I THINK IT'S STRANGE
TO SEE MY WIFE BILLED

00:06.337 --> 00:08.639
AS "MRS. VAN de KAMP."
 IT'S HOW I'M KNOWN.

00:08.639 --> 00:12.743
IS THERE A MR. VAN de KAMP?
 NO, UH, MR. VAN de KAMP
IS DECEASED.

00:12.743 --> 00:15.286
WOULD IT HAVE KILLED YOU
TO HAVE MENTIONED ME?

00:15.286 --> 00:18.289
IT'S BECAUSE I WENT TO JAIL,
ISN'T IT?
 LYNETTE'S HUSBAND WAS EXCITED.

00:18.289 --> 00:20.291
WE'RE GONNA START
A GARAGE BAND!

00:20.291 --> 00:23.224
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO SAID YOU WANTED

00:23.224 --> 00:25.796
TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY.
 GUYS NEED TO BLOW OFF STEAM.

00:25.796 --> 00:28.459
EDIE'S NEW HUSBAND
HAD A PAST...
 (man) YOU'VE BEEN HERE
SIX WEEKS,

00:28.459 --> 00:30.661
AND YOU DON'T SEEM ANY CLOSER
TO COMING TO TERMS

00:30.661 --> 00:32.803
WITH YOUR RAGE.
 I'VE COME TO TERMS WITH IT,

00:32.803 --> 00:35.766
AND I LIKE IT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.
 (Mary Alice)
...WHICH REMAINED A MYSTERY.

00:35.766 --> 00:37.668
I JUST THINK IT'S ODD THAT
YOU'RE MARRIED TO SOME GUY.

00:37.668 --> 00:40.341
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
 WELL, SHE KEPT ASKING ME
ALL THIS STUFF

00:40.341 --> 00:42.173
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND.

00:42.173 --> 00:44.175
AND SUSAN TRIED TO MOVE ON.

00:44.175 --> 00:47.418
WELL, I SORT OF STARTED
SEEING SOMEONE.
 GOOD FOR YOU.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.155
(indistinct conversations)

00:54.155 --> 00:56.727
EVERY YEAR,
MS. ELENORA BUTTERS

00:56.727 --> 00:58.729
WOULD ASK
HER KINDERGARTEN CLASS

00:58.729 --> 01:01.292
TO DRAW A PICTURE
OF THEIR FAMILIES

01:01.292 --> 01:06.267
WHICH SHE WOULD THEN DISPLAY
ON "MEET THE TEACHER" NIGHT.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.269
THAT'S HOW
TY RICHMOND'S PARENTS

01:08.269 --> 01:11.142
SAW HIS DEPICTION
OF THEIR FIGHTING...

01:13.174 --> 01:15.176
AND AMY HINES' PARENTS

01:15.176 --> 01:19.079
SAW HER PORTRAYAL
OF THEIR DRINKING.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.081
AND JASON MONTE'S PARENTS

01:21.081 --> 01:24.755
SAW HIS ILLUSTRATION
OF THEIR HYGIENE.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.121
YOU SEE, MS. BUTTERS
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT

01:30.121 --> 01:34.265
FOR PARENTS TO SEE THEMSELVES
THROUGH THEIR CHILDREN'S EYES.

01:34.265 --> 01:37.728
SHE KNEW THE EXPERIENCE...

01:37.728 --> 01:40.531
ED, HE'S GOT ME VACUUMING
IN MY BRA.

01:40.531 --> 01:42.533
DO I DO THAT?
 (mouths words)

01:42.533 --> 01:46.137
COULD BE VERY EDUCATIONAL.

01:46.137 --> 01:47.808
I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.481
DID I NOT SAY 7:00?
YOU MISSED THEIR LITTLE SHOW.

01:50.481 --> 01:53.113
M.J. WAS TOOTH DECAY.
 WELL, CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
KILLED ME.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.186
AND I TOLD YOU
TO VIDEOTAPE IT.

01:55.186 --> 01:57.718
WELL, DID YOU TELL ME
TO TAKE OFF THE LENS CAP?

01:57.718 --> 02:01.392
NEXT TIME, BE MORE SPECIFIC.
 MR. DELFINO, GLAD YOU MADE IT.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.724
UH, DID YOU GET TO SEE
M.J.'s ARTWORK?

02:03.724 --> 02:06.227
NO, NOT YET. CAN'T WAIT.
 OH.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.729
(chuckles)
 OH, HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.860
THERE WE ARE,
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.863
LOOK WHAT HE DID
WITH MY HAIR.
 (laughs)

02:12.863 --> 02:15.836
I KIND OF LIKE THE BANGS.
 YEAH, LOOK,
HE PUT A WRENCH IN MY POCKET.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.839
AND SEE HOW BIG MY MUSCLES ARE?
 (laughs)
WHICH IS A GOOD THING,

02:18.839 --> 02:22.543
'CAUSE THERE'S A SHARK
ATTACKING THE HOUSE.
 (laughs)

02:22.543 --> 02:23.874
HEY, DADDY.

02:23.874 --> 02:25.876
HEY, BUDDY.
YOUR MOMMY AND I

02:25.876 --> 02:27.878
WERE JUST LOOKING
AT YOUR WONDERFUL PAINTING.

02:27.878 --> 02:29.380
YOU LIKE IT?

02:29.380 --> 02:32.183
I LOVE IT, ESPECIALLY HOW BIG
AND STRONG YOU MADE ME LOOK.

02:32.183 --> 02:34.185
THAT'S NOT YOU.
THAT'S JACKSON.

02:34.185 --> 02:36.887
SEE THE PAINTBRUSH
IN HIS POCKET?

02:38.529 --> 02:41.292
OH, WHO'S JACKSON?

02:41.292 --> 02:43.163
HE PAINTS OUR HOUSE...

02:43.163 --> 02:46.537
UNTIL MY MOM MAKES HIM DRINK
WINE AND HAVE A SLEEPOVER.

02:46.537 --> 02:48.239
UH...

02:48.239 --> 02:49.500
(stammering) UH...

02:49.500 --> 02:51.302
BECAUSE...

02:51.302 --> 02:55.175
MIKE AND I ARE DIVORCED,
SO THAT'S WHY...

02:55.175 --> 02:58.209
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A PICTURE OF THE FAMILY,

02:58.209 --> 02:59.950
SO YOU SHOULD'VE
PUT YOUR DADDY IN IT.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.512
I DID.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.222
OH, THE...
THE BUG WITH THE LITTLE HAT?

03:11.222 --> 03:12.593
THAT'S YOU,

03:12.593 --> 03:15.626
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
SO FAR AWAY.

03:15.626 --> 03:17.898
OH, YEAH, THAT'S, UM...

03:17.898 --> 03:21.402
NOW I SEE ME.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.904
YES... EVERY YEAR,

03:23.904 --> 03:26.237
MS. ELENORA BUTTERS
WOULD ASK HER CLASS

03:26.237 --> 03:29.240
TO DRAW A PICTURE
OF THEIR FAMILIES,

03:29.240 --> 03:32.413
EVEN THOUGH
SHE KNEW THE PORTRAITS...

03:32.413 --> 03:35.416
MIGHT NOT BE THAT FLATTERING.

03:45.956 --> 03:48.459
(doorbell rings)

03:48.459 --> 03:51.802
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY
INTO THE FACES OF YOUR FRIENDS,

03:51.802 --> 03:53.764
YOU'LL SEE IT.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.407
HEY!
 HI!

03:56.407 --> 03:57.738
CONGRATULATIONS!
 HI!

03:57.738 --> 03:59.810
COME ON IN!

03:59.810 --> 04:01.272
RIGHT BEHIND THEIR SMILES,

04:01.272 --> 04:04.445
YOU WILL SEE
A CERTAIN GREEN-EYED MONSTER,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.847
AND THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

04:06.847 --> 04:11.021
HOW ENVIOUS THEY ARE
OF YOUR WELL-KEPT HOME...

04:11.021 --> 04:14.955
YOUR DELICIOUS RECIPES...

04:14.955 --> 04:18.858
AND YOUR TASTEFUL POSSESSIONS.

04:18.858 --> 04:22.293
HERE'S MY COOKBOOK.

04:22.293 --> 04:25.496
(cheering)
 BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK HARD
TO SEE THE JEALOUSY,

04:25.496 --> 04:28.569
BECAUSE GOOD FRIENDS
ALWAYS WORK HARD

04:28.569 --> 04:30.601
TO HIDE IT.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.045
LOOK AT YOU,
RIGHT ON THE COVER!

04:35.045 --> 04:37.047
THESE ARE ADVANCED COPIES.

04:37.047 --> 04:39.980
I WANTED YOU TO BE
THE FIRST TO HAVE THEM.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.483
OH, AND LOOK, YOU SIGNED IT--
"TO LYNETTE,

04:42.483 --> 04:45.416
THE SWEETEST, MOST WONDERFUL
FRIEND I'VE EVER KNOWN."

04:45.416 --> 04:46.417
AW. (laughs)

04:46.417 --> 04:48.589
"TO SUSAN,
THE SWEETEST, MOST--"

04:48.589 --> 04:51.562
WE DON'T HAVE TO READ THEM
OUT LOUD.

04:51.562 --> 04:53.494
DON'T MIND ME, LADIES.

04:53.494 --> 04:57.468
I'M JUST GRABBING A KISS ON
MY WAY TO THE SALT MINES. MMM.
 OH. MMM. YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY.

04:57.468 --> 05:00.631
THANKS, BABE. OH, DID YOU
SHOW THEM THE AD? YEAH.
 OH, I ALMOST FORGOT. UH, BYE.

05:00.631 --> 05:01.932
ISN'T THIS NICE?

05:01.932 --> 05:04.635
THEY'RE RUNNING IT NEXT MONTH
IN "WOMAN'S DAY."

05:04.635 --> 05:06.877
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN MAGAZINES,
TOO?

05:06.877 --> 05:09.640
THEY'VE COME UP WITH
THIS WHOLE MARKETING PLAN--

05:09.640 --> 05:12.042
RADIO, PRINT, BOOK SIGNINGS.

05:12.042 --> 05:15.045
WOW! ISN'T IT FANTASTIC?
 NO, IT'S HORRIBLE!

05:15.045 --> 05:17.047
SHE'S GONNA BECOME
THIS FAMOUS AUTHOR

05:17.047 --> 05:19.049
AND HAVE NO TIME AT ALL
FOR US.

05:19.049 --> 05:22.753
NO, COME ON, GABY. YOU KNOW
THAT BREE WILL NEVER CHANGE.
 THANK YOU, KATHERINE.

05:22.753 --> 05:24.755
I WILL NEVER BECOME STUCK-UP
AND FULL OF MYSELF.

05:24.755 --> 05:27.798
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
 I SAID YOU'D NEVER CHANGE.

05:27.798 --> 05:28.929
VERY FUNNY.

05:28.929 --> 05:32.062
I HARDLY THINK YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME BECOMING FAMOUS.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.064
YOU HAVE A MARKETING PLAN.

05:34.064 --> 05:37.468
YOU WANNA SEE
 MY MARKETING PLAN?

05:37.468 --> 05:41.071
"MILK, BREAD,
VODKA, CONDOMS--"

05:41.071 --> 05:42.513
(laughter)

05:42.513 --> 05:45.516
COULD I SEE THAT?
I'D LOVE TO READ IT.
 WHY?

05:45.516 --> 05:47.948
WELL, BACK BEFORE I CONSECRATED
MY LIFE TO MOZZARELLA,

05:47.948 --> 05:49.950
MARKETING WAS SORT OF
WHAT I DID.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.782
OH, RIGHT! OF COURSE.

05:51.782 --> 05:54.485
I WOULD, UH,
LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.

05:54.485 --> 05:55.926
SO YOU'RE STILL GONNA

05:55.926 --> 05:58.128
WANNA HANG OUT WITH US, EVEN
WHEN YOU'RE TOTALLY FABULOUS,

05:58.128 --> 06:00.391
AND WE'RE STILL NOBODIES?

06:00.391 --> 06:02.533
GIRLS, YOU ARE MAKING WAY
TOO MUCH OF THIS.
 (cell phone rings)

06:02.533 --> 06:05.536
I AM NOT A BIT MORE FABULOUS
THAN ANY ONE OF YOU.
 (ring)

06:05.536 --> 06:07.798
EXCUSE ME.
 (beep)

06:07.798 --> 06:10.801
WHAT IS IT, ANDREW?
 I HOPE YOU'RE
FREE FOR LUNCH ON THE 12th,

06:10.801 --> 06:12.803
'CAUSE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

06:12.803 --> 06:14.875

BUSINESSWOMAN OF THE YEAR.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.978

06:33.994 --> 06:36.597

06:38.028 --> 06:39.169
(beep)

06:39.169 --> 06:40.531
HI.

06:40.531 --> 06:42.503
ORSON, I HAVE AMAZING NEWS.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.105
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

 OH? WHAT ABOUT?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
I wanna buy you lunch

06:47.107 --> 06:49.510
I WILL BE AT YOUR OFFICE
IN TWO MINUTES.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.642
UH, NO! NO, DON'T COME
TO MY OFFICE.

06:51.642 --> 06:54.645
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HAVE LUNCH
NOW. UM, I'M IN A MEETING.

06:54.645 --> 06:56.987
WELL, I'LL WAIT IN RECEPTION
UNTIL IT'S OVER.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.989
NO, IT'LL TAKE HOURS.

06:58.989 --> 07:01.051
IT'S A VERY URGENT,
HIGH-LEVEL STUFF.

07:01.051 --> 07:03.994
(playing Caribbean music)

07:06.827 --> 07:08.959
(music continues)
 WHAT KIND OF MEETING IS IT?

07:08.959 --> 07:11.101
George, hey!

07:11.101 --> 07:12.563
TURN THAT RADIO DOWN!

07:12.563 --> 07:15.906
WHERE ARE YOU?
 I TOLD YOU, I'M IN A MEETING.

07:15.906 --> 07:17.968
♪♪♪

07:17.968 --> 07:19.970
I gotta go.

07:19.970 --> 07:21.572
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

07:22.973 --> 07:26.076
YES, YOU WILL.

07:27.077 --> 07:29.049
(beep)

07:31.151 --> 07:33.083
MIKE! WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:33.083 --> 07:35.225
DADDY GOT ME A BIKE.

07:35.225 --> 07:37.628
YES, I SEE. AND HERE,

07:37.628 --> 07:40.130
MOMMY THOUGHT WE'D AGREED
TO WAIT TILL YOUR BIRTHDAY.

07:40.130 --> 07:42.633
CRAZY MOMMY.
 CAN YOU TEACH ME TO RIDE IT?

07:42.633 --> 07:45.095
NO, NOT TODAY. I GOTTA
GO INSTALL A WATER HEATER.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.637
BUT, UH,
YOU KEEP PRACTICING,

07:46.637 --> 07:49.139
AND THE NEXT AFTERNOON
I HAVE FREE, WE'LL BUST OFF

07:49.139 --> 07:52.072
THOSE TRAINING WHEELS
AND GO KICK UP SOME DIRT. OKAY?
 OKAY.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.244
ALL RIGHT.

07:54.244 --> 07:56.146
OH, MY GOD.
 (bicycle bell rings)

07:56.146 --> 07:58.849
THIS IS ABOUT M.J.'s DRAWING,
ISN'T IT?

07:58.849 --> 08:00.551
WHAT?

08:00.551 --> 08:03.053
HE DOES NOT LOVE JACKSON
MORE THAN YOU.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.556
HE KNOWS WHO HIS FATHER IS.
 I KNOW THAT.

08:05.556 --> 08:08.689
CAN'T A GUY GET HIS KID A BIKE
WITHOUT BEING PSYCHOANALYZED?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.121
SO YOU'RE TOTALLY FINE
WITH THAT DRAWING?

08:11.121 --> 08:14.124
WELL, I WON'T GO STICKING IT
ON MY FRIDGE ANYTIME SOON,

08:14.124 --> 08:16.527
BUT YEAH.
 (shuts truck gate)

08:16.527 --> 08:19.229
LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU'RE DATING
A NICE GUY.
 (car approaching)

08:19.229 --> 08:22.773
I'M GLAD HE LIKES MY KID,
AND MY KID LIKES HIM.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.875
HERE'S A BIKE.
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.077
HEY, GUYS.

08:27.077 --> 08:30.611
JACKSON,
LOOK AT MY NEW BIKE!

08:30.611 --> 08:31.812
PRETTY COOL.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.914
(Susan chuckles)

08:33.914 --> 08:36.847
(Mike) UH, THAT'S A CUSTOM
TITANIUM FRAME.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.019
MAKE SURE M.J. KNOWS THAT.

08:41.150 --> 08:44.024
(man on TV) SO, WENDY,
I GOTTA KNOW ABOUT THE WEATHER.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.026
MOMMY,
CAN BETHANY GO HOME NOW?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.028
HONEY, SHE'S ONLY BEEN HERE
20 MINUTES.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.030
WE INVITED HER OVER TO PLAY,
SO GO PLAY.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.032
BUT ALL SHE DOES IS SPIN.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.865
(woman) ...SOMEWHAT ACROSS
THE REACH OF THE STATE,

08:54.865 --> 08:57.167
KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN
I WOULD SAY A FEW DEGREES...

08:57.167 --> 08:59.139
HONEY, WE WANT BETHANY
TO BE OUR FRIEND,

08:59.139 --> 09:02.142
SO IF SHE WANTS TO SPIN,
JUST SUCK IT UP AND SPIN.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.646
(woman speaking indistinctly
on TV)

09:05.646 --> 09:08.649
WHY ARE YOU SHOVING THAT LITTLE
WEIRDO DOWN JUANITA'S THROAT?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.952
THAT LITTLE WEIRDO IS THE KEY
TO YOU AND I HAVING MORE SEX.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.754
(laughter)

09:13.754 --> 09:16.927
I KNOW I SHOULD ASK
A FEW QUESTIONS, BUT I'M IN.

09:16.927 --> 09:18.929
BETHANY'S MOM HOSTS
A WEEKLY PLAYDATE.

09:18.929 --> 09:21.191
I'M TRYING TO GET JUANITA
AN INVITATION.

09:21.191 --> 09:24.194
HOW DOES THAT LEAD TO
QUALITY TIME WITH YOUR BOOBS?

09:24.194 --> 09:27.067
CARLOS, THE ONLY TIME
YOU AND I HAVE TO OURSELVES

09:27.067 --> 09:30.070
IS LATE AT NIGHT, BUT BY
THAT TIME, WE'RE TOO EXHAUSTED.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.242
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE CELIA
IN AFTERNOON PRESCHOOL,

09:32.242 --> 09:34.945
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS UNLOAD JUANITA,

09:34.945 --> 09:37.608
AND THEN WE CAN GET BACK
TO DOING THE NASTY.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.109
THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

09:39.109 --> 09:42.112
I MEAN, DUMPING OUR KID OFF
ON SOME UNSUSPECTING WOMAN

09:42.112 --> 09:44.615
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SEX?

09:44.615 --> 09:47.057
WAKE UP! PLAYDATES WERE
INVENTED BY MOTHERS

09:47.057 --> 09:48.759
FOR THIS EXACT PURPOSE.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.761
SHOPPING, SEX,
DRINKING IN THE AFTERNOON--

09:50.761 --> 09:53.263
PLAYDATES MAKE
ALL THESE THINGS POSSIBLE.

09:53.263 --> 09:54.965
I-I DON'T KNOW.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.267
I FEEL BAD MAKING MY KID
PLAY WITH SOMEONE

09:57.267 --> 09:59.329
THAT SHE OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T LIKE.

09:59.329 --> 10:02.172
BETHANY'S MOM WILL TAKE JUANITA
ONCE A WEEK FOR TWO WHOLE HOURS.

10:02.172 --> 10:04.174
THAT IS SEX AND A NAP.

10:06.877 --> 10:08.338
JUANITA!

10:08.338 --> 10:11.942
I DON'T HEAR YOU SPINNING!

10:11.942 --> 10:14.845
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU SAID
THE JOB WAS GOING SO WELL.

10:14.845 --> 10:16.847
IT WAS.
THEN THREE WEEKS AGO,

10:16.847 --> 10:19.750
MY PAROLE OFFICER
LEFT ME A MESSAGE AT WORK.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.052
THAT'S WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
I LIED ON MY APPLICATION

10:22.052 --> 10:24.324
WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.798
SO YOU'VE BEEN PRETENDING
TO GO TO WORK FOR THREE WEEKS?

10:27.798 --> 10:29.660
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.131
HONEY...

10:31.131 --> 10:34.064
I'M NOT ANGRY.

10:34.064 --> 10:37.708
I'M HURT THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE YOU COULD TELL ME.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.409
I WAS EMBARRASSED.

10:39.409 --> 10:42.112
BREE, WHEN WE MARRIED,
I WAS THE BREADWINNER.

10:42.112 --> 10:45.145
NOW YOU--YOU HAVE YOUR COMPANY
AND YOU HAVE YOUR BOOK.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.778
I-I'M A FELON
WHO CAN'T HOLD ON TO A JOB.

10:47.778 --> 10:51.081
ORSON, WE'RE PARTNERS.
WE SHARE EVERYTHING.

10:51.081 --> 10:52.783
ANY SUCCESS I HAVE

10:52.783 --> 10:55.255
IS JUST AS MUCH YOURS
AS IT IS MINE.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.089
THANK YOU, DARLING.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.333
SO...
 (pats leg)

11:03.333 --> 11:05.335
WHY DID
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CALL?

11:08.068 --> 11:11.041
APPARENTLY, WE'VE BEEN NAMED
BUSINESSWOMAN OF THE YEAR.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.107
(playing Jimi Hendrix's
"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)")

11:22.853 --> 11:24.184
IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH?!

11:24.184 --> 11:27.417
♪♪♪

11:31.221 --> 11:33.193
YAH! WHOO!

11:33.193 --> 11:36.126
WOW!
YOU'D BE KILLER IN OUR BAND.

11:36.126 --> 11:39.699
I MEAN, WOULDN'T HE
BE KILLER, DAVE?
 UH, DONALD, WHY DON'T YOU
LET US TALK IT OVER,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU?
 NO PROBLEM.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.874
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE ANYWAY.

11:43.874 --> 11:47.177
QUARTERLY TAX TIME
HAS GOT ME SWAMPED.
 WELL, WE'LL--WE'LL DEFINITELY
CALL YOU TODAY.

11:47.177 --> 11:49.139
THANKS, GENTLEMEN.

11:49.139 --> 11:51.081
(laughs)

11:51.081 --> 11:52.412
DON'T YOU THINK
HE CRUSHED IT?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.445
HE WAS GOOD...
YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY.

11:55.445 --> 11:58.448
HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE HEART.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:58.448 --> 12:02.092
WHEN HE PLAYED "VOODOO CHILD,"
IT WAS LIKE HENDRIX HAS RISEN.

12:02.092 --> 12:05.255
HEY, WHAT ABOUT MIKE? I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHO WE WERE GONNA GET.

12:05.255 --> 12:08.158
WELL, I ASKED,
BUT HE SAID HE'S TOO BUSY.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.460
TOO BUSY TO LIVE A LITTLE?
NOT GONNA FLY.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.134
CALL HIM. GIVE HIM MY NUMBER.
I'LL TALK TO HIM.
 OKAY, SURE.
BUT--BUT WHAT ABOUT DONALD?

12:14.134 --> 12:17.838
I MEAN, 'CAUSE IF WE DON'T
GET MIKE, I WANNA MAKE S--

12:17.838 --> 12:20.170
TOM, DONALD'S OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

12:20.170 --> 12:21.171
(slaps arm)

12:21.171 --> 12:23.043
HAVE MIKE CALL ME.

12:40.891 --> 12:42.092
WHOO!

12:42.092 --> 12:43.964
WHAT A REHEARSAL.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.067
(laughs) DAVE AND I
WERE SMOKIN'.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.870
(mouthing words)
 DID YOU HEAR US?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.301
LYNETTE?

12:53.173 --> 12:54.144
LYNETTE.

12:54.144 --> 12:55.876
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

12:55.876 --> 12:58.308
NEVER MIND.

12:58.308 --> 13:01.381
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?
WHAT, IS THIS BREE'S AD STUFF?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.783
OH, GOD, NO.
HER AGENCY REALLY WHIFFED...
 HMM?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.856
SO I'M COMING UP WITH
A WHOLE NEW CAMPAIGN.

13:05.856 --> 13:07.858
I WAS LOOKING
THROUGH MY OLD PORTFOLIO

13:07.858 --> 13:09.920
FOR INSPIRATION.
 MM-HMM. (chuckles)

13:09.920 --> 13:11.261
OH! I REMEMBER THIS ONE.

13:11.261 --> 13:14.264
"FEET? MEET YOUR NEW
BEST FRIENDS." IT WAS A CLASSIC.
 (laughs)

13:14.264 --> 13:18.128
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE
I LOOKED THROUGH THIS STUFF.

13:18.128 --> 13:20.430
I'D FORGOTTEN I WAS...
KINDA GREAT.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.232
YOU WERE AWESOME!

13:22.232 --> 13:24.234
I MEAN, COME ON.
HOW LUCKY IS BREE

13:24.234 --> 13:27.237
TO HAVE A NEIGHBOR THAT USED
TO BE A BIG ADVERTISING HOTSHOT?

13:27.237 --> 13:29.239
WELL,
MAYBE I'M THE LUCKY ONE.

13:29.239 --> 13:31.241
THIS COULD BE
A PERFECT WAY FOR ME

13:31.241 --> 13:33.813
TO STICK MY TOE
BACK IN THE BUSINESS.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.416
NOTHING BIG, MAYBE JUST
PICK UP SOME FREELANCE WORK.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.419
BUT, HONEY, IF YOU DO THAT,
WHERE YOU GONNA FIND THE TIME

13:39.419 --> 13:42.422
FOR THE FAMILY
AND THE RESTAURANT?
 WELL, GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

13:42.422 --> 13:46.096
I GUESS THE SAME PLACE THAT YOU
 FIND TIME FOR YOUR GARAGE BAND.

13:46.096 --> 13:49.860
LYNETTE, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT IF--IF YOU...
 (grunts)

13:54.204 --> 13:55.565
(fizz)

13:55.565 --> 13:57.868
OKAY, I DROPPED OFF CELIA
AT PRESCHOOL,

13:57.868 --> 13:59.870
AND JUANITA'S AT HER PLAYDATE.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.411
DROP TROU.
 (Carlos sighs)

14:01.411 --> 14:05.145
WHY DON'T YOU PUT ON
THAT SEXY RED TEDDY?

14:05.145 --> 14:08.178
CAN I ASK WHY?
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

14:08.178 --> 14:10.180
YEAH, BUT I CAN FEEL IT,

14:10.180 --> 14:13.423
AND I LOVE THE SENSATION
OF SLIDING SILK OFF YOUR BODY.

14:13.423 --> 14:16.086
OH.

14:16.086 --> 14:18.128
WHAT'S IT LIKE, CARLOS?

14:18.128 --> 14:19.629
WHAT?

14:19.629 --> 14:22.132
SEX AS A BLIND MAN.

14:22.132 --> 14:24.634
I MEAN, YOU USED TO BE
SO VISUAL.

14:24.634 --> 14:26.636
IS IT STILL AS GOOD?

14:26.636 --> 14:28.298
OH, IT'S BETTER.

14:28.298 --> 14:30.300
I MEAN, HAVING TO RELY ON

14:30.300 --> 14:33.303
YOUR SENSES OF TOUCH
AND TASTE AND SMELL...

14:33.303 --> 14:35.305
IT'S ACTUALLY
WAY MORE INTENSE.

14:35.305 --> 14:37.277
REALLY?
(sighs) YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.910
WHAT, YOU WANT BLIND SEX?

14:39.910 --> 14:41.912
I THINK I CAN ARRANGE THAT.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.487
HEY THERE.

14:49.219 --> 14:52.292
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
JOB INTERVIEW WENT WELL.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.364
NOPE.
THEY TURNED ME DOWN FLAT.

14:54.364 --> 14:57.367
AW.
 BUT AS I WAS DRIVING HOME,
IT SUDDENLY HIT ME.

14:57.367 --> 15:00.430
I MAY BE PERSONA NON GRATA
AT EVERY COMPANY IN THIS TOWN,

15:00.430 --> 15:02.602
BUT THERE'S AT LEAST
ONE EMPLOYER I KNOW

15:02.602 --> 15:04.935
WHO WOULD LOVE TO HIRE ME.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.077
OH. WHO?

15:07.077 --> 15:10.040
YOU.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.511
YOU WANNA WORK HERE?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.483
WHY NOT?

15:13.483 --> 15:16.246
I'M GREAT WITH FOOD.
I UNDERSTAND BUSINESS.

15:16.246 --> 15:19.149
I CAN'T BEAT THE COMMUTE.

15:19.149 --> 15:21.621
WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY
AN INTRIGUING NOTION.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.624
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE AWKWARD
HAVING ME AS YOUR BOSS?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.196
ABSOLUTELY.

15:26.196 --> 15:28.198
BUT AS YOU SAID
IN THE PARK,

15:28.198 --> 15:29.629
WE SHARE EVERYTHING.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.332
SO I WOULD BE
MORE OF A... PARTNER.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.234
(Bree) PARTNERS? OH.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.667
WELL--
 BREE, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT?

15:37.667 --> 15:40.340
JUST GIVE ME A SEC.

15:40.340 --> 15:44.714
I THINK THE LILIES
NEED THEIR OWN VASE.

15:44.714 --> 15:46.716
(lowers voice)
IF YOU HIRE HIM,

15:46.716 --> 15:48.718
I WILL CUT YOU
WITH THESE SCISSORS!

15:48.718 --> 15:50.720
I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO DO THAT.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.722
(normal voice) I THINK THEY'RE
CROWDING THE IRISES OUT.

15:52.722 --> 15:55.355
(lowers voice) JUST LIKE
HE'S TRYING TO CROWD ME OUT.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.357
YOU ALREADY HAVE A PARTNER,
REMEMBER?

15:57.357 --> 15:59.459
OH, WELL, I THINK
THE IRISES AND THE LILIES

15:59.459 --> 16:02.962
COULD WORK TOGETHER.
 (normal voice) NOPE.
ONE OF THEM HAS TO GO.

16:02.962 --> 16:07.337
IF I MAY OFFER AN OPINION--
 NOT A GOOD TIME, ORSON.

16:07.337 --> 16:09.569
(lowers voice)
TELL HIM NOW,

16:09.569 --> 16:12.442
OR I WILL WALK.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.476
ORSON, YOU REALLY DON'T
WANNA WORK WITH ME.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.608
I MEAN, YOU ONLY SEE ME
AT HOME.

16:18.608 --> 16:22.152
BUT AT WORK, WHEN THE PRESSURE'S
ON, I CAN BE A BIT OF A HANDFUL.

16:22.152 --> 16:25.155
KATHERINE'S SEEN HOW I GET.
 OH, YES.
BITCHY, TYRANNICAL, SHRILL--

16:25.155 --> 16:26.986
HE GETS IT, DEAR.

16:30.020 --> 16:32.022
HONEY, YOU'RE MY PARTNER
IN LIFE.

16:32.022 --> 16:34.024
BUT IF WE WANT
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY,

16:34.024 --> 16:36.026
WE SHOULDN'T MIX MARRIAGE
AND BUSINESS.

16:36.026 --> 16:38.328
BUT NO ONE ELSE
WILL HIRE ME.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.630
WELL, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN LOOKING
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

16:40.630 --> 16:43.333
I MEAN, GIVE IT ANOTHER...
SAY, MONTH OR TWO,

16:43.333 --> 16:45.635
AND IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYTHING,

16:45.635 --> 16:47.637
THEN WE'LL REVISIT THE IDEA.
OKAY?

16:49.639 --> 16:51.010
OKAY.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.012
IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.318
(opens door)

17:00.690 --> 17:02.792
OH! (panting)
 (sighs)

17:02.792 --> 17:04.794
OH, SO WHAT'D YOU THINK?

17:04.794 --> 17:06.796
OH, MY GOD,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:06.796 --> 17:08.458
BLIND SEX IS INCREDIBLE.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.461
(groans) AHH, GIVE ME TEN MORE
MINUTES AND AN ENERGY BAR,

17:11.461 --> 17:13.703
AND WE CAN GO ONE MORE TIME.
(laughs)
 (laughs)

17:13.703 --> 17:16.705
(slurping)

17:19.239 --> 17:21.211
NO, I THINK WE'RE DONE.

17:21.211 --> 17:22.712
WHAT?

17:31.421 --> 17:32.682
(Gabrielle) HONEY!

17:32.682 --> 17:35.325
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT BETHANY'S.

17:35.325 --> 17:38.057
I GOT A TUMMYACHE.
HER MOM BROUGHT ME BACK.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.289
OH.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.791
WELL, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN STANDING THERE?

17:41.791 --> 17:44.334
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT WERE YOU TWO DOING?

17:45.465 --> 17:48.238
UM, WE WERE, UH...

17:48.238 --> 17:50.540
WE WERE WRESTLING.
WRESTLING.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.303
DID DADDY HURT YOU?
YOU WERE MAKING LOUD NOISES.

17:53.303 --> 17:56.546
NO! NO, THAT WASN'T REAL.

17:56.546 --> 17:59.249
SOMETIMES I FAKE IT
WHEN I WRESTLE WITH DADDY.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.383
PLEASE DON'T WRESTLE
WITH MOMMY.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.515
YOU'RE TOO BIG.
YOU COULD HURT HER.

18:05.515 --> 18:09.088
YEAH, CARLOS, STOP THAT.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
OKAY, GO TO YOUR ROOM,

18:11.090 --> 18:14.224
AND I'M GONNA BRING YOU
SOMETHING FOR YOUR TUMMY.

18:14.224 --> 18:16.766
(exhales deeply)
I THINK SHE BOUGHT IT.

18:16.766 --> 18:19.199
YOU MEAN THE STORY
OF HOW DADDY BEATS UP MOMMY?

18:19.199 --> 18:23.203
RELAX. I TOLD HER I WAS FINE.
 LOOK, I COULD HEAR
THE WORRY IN HER VOICE.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.205
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TELL HER THE TRUTH?

18:25.205 --> 18:27.207
WHAT, THAT SOMETIMES
MOMMY RIDES DADDY

18:27.207 --> 18:29.209
LIKE A MECHANICAL BULL
TO GET JEWELRY?

18:29.209 --> 18:33.443
SHE'S 5. SHE'S TOO YOUNG TO
UNDERSTAND EITHER HALF OF THAT.
 IT'S THE FACTS OF LIFE.

18:33.443 --> 18:35.785
SHE'S GONNA LEARN 'EM
EVENTUALLY,

18:35.785 --> 18:37.787
AND IT'S THE MOST NATURAL THING
IN THE WORLD.

18:37.787 --> 18:39.789
CARLOS, IF SHE WAS
STANDING THERE

18:39.789 --> 18:42.252
ANY LONGER
THAN FIVE MINUTES,

18:42.252 --> 18:45.155
THERE WAS NOTHING NATURAL
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW.

18:45.155 --> 18:47.557
BY THE WAY,
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.259
(telephone rings)

18:49.259 --> 18:50.300
(ring)

18:50.300 --> 18:51.801
(beep)
 HELLO?

18:51.801 --> 18:53.633
HEY, IT'S ME. LISTEN,

18:53.633 --> 18:55.235
I've got some free time,

18:55.235 --> 18:57.467
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME OVER

18:57.467 --> 19:00.870
and teach M.J.
how to ride his new bike.
 GREAT.
HE'S SO EXCITED TO LEARN.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.413
ARE YOU SURE HE'S READY
TO GO WITHOUT TRAINING WHEELS?

19:03.413 --> 19:05.415
Oh, he'll probably
have to take a few spills,

19:05.415 --> 19:09.279
BUT LUCKILY, HE'LL HAVE HIS
OLD MAN THERE TO PICK HIM UP.

19:09.279 --> 19:11.621
YEAH. HE'S BEEN ASKING
WHEN YOU'RE COMING.

19:11.621 --> 19:14.254
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL HIM.
I KNOW HE'LL BE JUST...

19:14.254 --> 19:15.255
ALL RIGHT!

19:15.255 --> 19:16.686
AAH!

19:16.686 --> 19:18.788
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:18.788 --> 19:21.331
SPIDER. BIG ONE. GOTTA GO!
 (beep)

19:24.163 --> 19:25.895
MOMMY, LOOK,
NO TRAINING WHEELS.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.298
I KNOW! YOU DID GREAT!

19:28.298 --> 19:30.300
JACKSON, CAN I SEE YOU A SEC?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.802
THAT WAS AMAZING!
HE LEARNED SO FAST.

19:32.802 --> 19:35.805
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED?
MIKE IS ON HIS WAY OVER HERE

19:35.805 --> 19:38.448
TO TEACH HIS SON HOW
TO RIDE THE BIKE HE BOUGHT--

19:38.448 --> 19:41.411
SOMETHING HE WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO UNTIL YOU RUINED IT.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.283
W-WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT?
 I DIDN'T KNOW

19:43.283 --> 19:46.386
I HAD TO TELL YOU NOT TO STEAL
A FATHER'S PRECIOUS MOMENT.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.619
M.J.--HE JUST KEPT ASKING ME.
HE--HE MADE ME DO IT.
 YOU COULD'VE WALKED AWAY.

19:49.619 --> 19:51.291
NO, I COULDN'T!

19:51.291 --> 19:53.623
HE SAID, "PWEASE!"

19:53.623 --> 19:55.825
DAMN IT.

19:55.825 --> 19:59.269
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE GRAPHIC WORKS JUST AS WELL

19:59.269 --> 20:01.631
ON A FREE-STANDING
DISPLAY UNIT. NEAT, HUH?

20:01.631 --> 20:02.972
GOODNESS, LYNETTE.

20:02.972 --> 20:05.975
WHEN YOU OFFERED TO SHARE
YOUR THOUGHTS ON MY CAMPAIGN,

20:05.975 --> 20:08.778
I WASN'T EXPECTING ANYTHING
QUITE SO... ELABORATE.

20:08.778 --> 20:11.281
WELL, WHO KNEW YOUR MARKETING
GUYS WERE SUCH LAME-OS?

20:11.281 --> 20:14.284
WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH
IS SO...

20:14.284 --> 20:16.286
TEPID.

20:16.286 --> 20:19.819
UM, I THINK "UNDERSTATED"
WAS WHAT THEY WERE GOING FOR.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.292
WELL, THEY OVERSHOT
AND WOUND UP IN "BLAND,"

20:22.292 --> 20:24.294
RIGHT ON THE BORDER
OF "SUCKY."

20:24.294 --> 20:26.856
YOU NEED TO GRAB YOUR AUDIENCE,
JUST GRAB 'EM.

20:26.856 --> 20:29.259
I'VE GONE FOR JAZZIER COLORS,

20:29.259 --> 20:30.800
BOLDER FONTS.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.563
OH, I HAVE REALLY PLAYED UP
THE WHOLE NOSTALGIA ANGLE.

20:33.563 --> 20:34.904
(sighs)

20:34.904 --> 20:36.906
"LET MRS. VAN DE KAMP

20:36.906 --> 20:39.909
TURN YOUR OVEN
INTO A TIME MACHINE."

20:39.909 --> 20:42.342
I SEE WOMEN
REALLY RESPONDING TO THAT.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.444
DO YOU?

20:44.444 --> 20:46.646
BECAUSE I SEE CHILDREN

20:46.646 --> 20:50.280
CRAWLING INTO OVENS,
HOPING TO SEE DINOSAURS.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.621
OH.

20:51.621 --> 20:52.952
OKAY. WELL...

20:52.952 --> 20:55.425
I'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF ALTERNATIVES.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.287
OH, LYNETTE, I APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

20:57.287 --> 20:59.289
BUT I'VE ACTUALLY APPROVED
THE OLD CAMPAIGN,

20:59.289 --> 21:01.691
AND I CAN'T JUST TELL THEM
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

21:01.691 --> 21:03.693
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I'LL BE THE BAD GUY.

21:03.693 --> 21:05.695
JUST TELL 'EM
YOU'VE HIRED ME,

21:05.695 --> 21:09.739
AND I'LL GO IN THERE, SIX-GUNS
ABLAZING. (imitates gunshots)

21:09.739 --> 21:11.741
SO... DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

21:11.741 --> 21:14.043
JUST GIVE ME THE WORD.

21:14.043 --> 21:15.505
NO.

21:15.505 --> 21:16.806
NO?

21:16.806 --> 21:20.410
SORRY, BUT I PREFER
THEIR CAMPAIGN.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.412
BUT MINE IS BETTER.

21:22.412 --> 21:25.585
WELL, YOU'RE... ENTITLED
TO THINK SO, BUT I DON'T.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.388
LOOK, BREE...
(laughs nervously)

21:28.388 --> 21:31.391
I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE MORE
ABOUT MARKETING THAN YOU DO.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.693
WHEN I WAS IN IT,
I OWNED THIS TOWN.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.765
I HAD EVERY BIG ACCOUNT.

21:35.765 --> 21:39.369
HELL, I WAS EVEN NAMED
BUSINESSWOMAN OF THE YEAR.

21:39.369 --> 21:42.472
OH. WELL, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THAT AWARD.

21:42.472 --> 21:44.374
IN FACT,
I'M THIS YEAR'S RECIPIENT.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.407
REALLY?
 YES.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.580
THERE'S A LUNCHEON ON THE 12th.
I DO HOPE YOU CAN MAKE IT.
 OH.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.542
MWAH!

21:52.542 --> 21:54.414
BY THE WAY,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.416
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THOSE COLORS.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.348
VERY... JAZZY.

22:01.451 --> 22:03.423
(chuckles nervously)

22:05.324 --> 22:08.728
COME ON, M.J.
YOUR DADDY'S WAITING.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.636
MOMMY,
I DON'T WANNA FALL.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.938
OH, HONEY.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.471
YOU KNOW HOW YOU LIKE
TO PUSH THE BUTTON

22:21.471 --> 22:23.473
WHEN WE GO ON THE ELEVATOR,

22:23.473 --> 22:27.477
AND IF SOMEBODY ELSE PUSHES IT
FIRST, IT MAKES YOU SAD?
 BUT I DON'T WANNA FALL.

22:27.477 --> 22:29.118
JUST LISTEN. DADDY REALLY
WANTED TO BE THE ONE

22:29.118 --> 22:32.121
TO TEACH YOU TO RIDE YOUR BIKE,
AND IF YOU CAN ALREADY DO IT,

22:32.121 --> 22:34.123
IT'S GONNA MAKE HIM SAD.

22:34.123 --> 22:37.787
SO JUST LET DADDY
PUSH THE BUTTON. UNDERSTAND?

22:37.787 --> 22:39.489
OH, MAN.

22:39.489 --> 22:41.691
(laughs)

22:47.366 --> 22:49.639
WOW, HE'S REALLY
PICKING IT UP FAST.

22:49.639 --> 22:52.942
YEAH. I THINK IT'S JUST
BEGINNER'S LUCK.
 UH-HUH.

22:56.105 --> 22:59.779
ARE YOU SURE
HE HASN'T BEEN PRACTICING?
 NO. HE WAS ABSOLUTELY
WAITING FOR YOU.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.951
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M GONNA
GO CHECK HIS HELMET.

23:03.553 --> 23:05.555
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

23:05.555 --> 23:09.058
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE NEW AT IT.
 I DON'T WANT TO FALL.
I'M SCARED.

23:09.058 --> 23:12.462
OH! OF WHAT?
YOU'RE 3 INCHES OFF THE GROUND.

23:12.462 --> 23:15.164
YOU'RE COMPLETELY PADDED.
SO JUST DO WHAT I SAY--

23:15.164 --> 23:18.528
WOBBLE, WOBBLE.
"DADDY, LOOK AT ME!" CRASH.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.573
BOY...

23:23.573 --> 23:25.575
HE WAS JUST TELLING ME

23:25.575 --> 23:28.578
HOW GLAD HE IS
TO HAVE HIS DAD HERE. (laughs)
 REALLY?

23:28.578 --> 23:32.582
'CAUSE I ALMOST FEEL LIKE
HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED ME.
 OH, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.895
(bicycle bell rings)

23:45.895 --> 23:47.527
OH!

23:47.527 --> 23:50.159
WHOOPS-A-DAISY! OH, IT'S
A GOOD THING YOUR DAD'S HERE

23:50.159 --> 23:54.433
TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO DO IT RIGHT.
 OH, LOOKING GOOD, BUDDY,
BUT REMEMBER,

23:54.433 --> 23:56.506
WHEN YOU STOP, YOU GOTTA
PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN FIRST.

23:56.506 --> 23:58.137
OKAY?
 OW!

23:58.137 --> 24:02.441
OH, WHAT, DOES THAT HURT
RIGHT THERE, BUDDY?
 OH, HE'S FINE.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.913
NO, MOMMY. IT HURTS.

24:17.086 --> 24:20.089
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
 OH, WILL YOU STOP?

24:20.089 --> 24:22.091
THE DOCTOR SAID
IT WAS JUST A SPRAIN.

24:22.091 --> 24:24.163
I KNOW, BUT STILL,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED IT.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.866
YOU KNOW, WHY LOOK FOR BLAME?
KIDS FALL.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.838
IF YOU HAVE TO FIND FAULT,

24:28.838 --> 24:30.840
BLAME THE PAVEMENT,
NOT YOURSELF...

24:30.840 --> 24:32.902
OR ME.

24:32.902 --> 24:35.905
MOMMY!

24:35.905 --> 24:38.908
HE SHOULD HAVE HIS PITCHING ARM
BACK IN NO TIME.

24:38.908 --> 24:42.852
OH, THANK YOU.
 BUT I DID WANNA ASK--M.J. SAID
THAT HE FELL ON PURPOSE,

24:42.852 --> 24:44.654
SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU TELLING HIM

24:44.654 --> 24:47.687
TO "LET DADDY PUSH
THE ELEVATOR BUTTON"?

24:49.819 --> 24:51.791
YOU TOLD HIM TO FALL?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.764
REMEMBER, IT'S THE PAVEMENT
YOU'RE MAD AT.

24:54.764 --> 24:57.927
WHAT THE HELL, SUSAN? WHY WOULD
YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

24:57.927 --> 25:01.200
JACKSON TAUGHT HIM
TO RIDE THE BIKE.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.532
JACKSON.

25:02.532 --> 25:03.673
WHO'S JACKSON?

25:03.673 --> 25:06.175
HE DOES SLEEPOVERS
WITH MOMMY.

25:06.175 --> 25:09.178
THEY DRINK LOTS OF WINE.

25:09.178 --> 25:12.682
HEY, DOC. UH, DON'T YOU HAND OUT
LOLLIPOPS TO BRAVE LITTLE BOYS?

25:16.786 --> 25:19.749
I'M SORRY. M.J. WAS
EXCITED ABOUT THE BIKE,

25:19.749 --> 25:21.721
SO JACKSON TOOK OFF
THE TRAINING WHEELS

25:21.721 --> 25:24.023
AND TAUGHT HIM.
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.025
HE DIDN'T KNOW
I'D WANNA BE THE ONE

25:26.025 --> 25:29.929
TO TEACH MY OWN KID
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE?
 OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:29.929 --> 25:31.931
THIS IS NOT
JACKSON'S FAULT.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.103
YOU CAN'T
GIVE A 5-YEAR-OLD A BIKE

25:34.103 --> 25:37.106
AND EXPECT HIM TO WAIT
TO RIDE IT UNTIL YOU HAVE TIME.

25:37.106 --> 25:39.569
(sighs)

25:39.569 --> 25:42.572
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DIVORCED.

25:42.572 --> 25:45.845
IT MEANS THAT SOMETIMES
YOU WON'T BE THERE.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.947
I KNOW.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.119
IT'S...

25:51.951 --> 25:53.823
JUST HARDER

25:53.823 --> 25:55.825
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

25:57.627 --> 25:59.629
WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME,
TOO.

25:59.629 --> 26:02.792
I MISS THINGS
WHEN HE'S WITH YOU.

26:02.792 --> 26:05.164
AND I...

26:05.164 --> 26:09.098
AM TRYING TO COME TO TERMS
WITH MY GUILT, BECAUSE...

26:10.840 --> 26:13.102
I HAVE TO.

26:13.102 --> 26:14.774
SO DO YOU.

26:16.846 --> 26:19.879
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO.

26:25.054 --> 26:26.756
(sighs)

26:26.756 --> 26:28.217
(door shuts)

26:28.217 --> 26:30.690
HAS MIKE CALLED?

26:30.690 --> 26:32.261
HI, HONEY. YOU'RE HOME.

26:34.123 --> 26:36.095
SORRY, HON.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.226
HI.

26:37.226 --> 26:40.069
SO DID HE CALL?

26:40.069 --> 26:42.231
NO.

26:42.231 --> 26:43.903
HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.305
MRS. HUDSON'S
PUTTING HER HOUSE UP FOR SALE.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.307
I THINK WE SHOULD BUY IT.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.309
WHY?

26:50.309 --> 26:53.783
AS AN INVESTMENT.
I-I MEAN, IT'S FANTASTIC.

26:53.783 --> 26:56.786
MY FRIEND MARY ALICE BLEW
HER BRAINS OUT IN THIS HOUSE,

26:56.786 --> 26:59.248
AND ALL I'D HAVE TO DO
IS LET THAT SLIP,

26:59.248 --> 27:02.351
AND WE'D GET IT FOR A SONG.
 YEAH. I DON'T THINK SO.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.724
WELL, WHY NOT?
WE'LL RENT IT OUT.

27:04.724 --> 27:08.227
WE COULD MAKE
SOME SERIOUS MONEY.
 LAST THING I WANNA BE
IS A LANDLORD,

27:08.227 --> 27:10.860
GET A PHONE CALL EVERY TIME
A TOILET OVERFLOWS.

27:10.860 --> 27:14.633
THAT'S WHY WE HIRE
A MANAGEMENT COMPANY--
 DAMN IT, EDIE, I SAID NO!

27:21.911 --> 27:24.944
WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?

27:26.245 --> 27:28.778
I DON'T KNOW.

27:28.778 --> 27:31.781
I'M SORRY. I JUST GOT
A LOT ON MY MIND.

27:33.222 --> 27:35.925
I'M SORRY.

27:48.938 --> 27:50.239
(grunts)

27:53.773 --> 27:56.776
(pills rattling)

28:07.286 --> 28:09.288
(children shouting in distance)

28:09.288 --> 28:10.419
HI, BETHANY.

28:10.419 --> 28:12.461
I'M HERE TO PICK UP JUANITA.
IS SHE AROUND?

28:12.461 --> 28:14.463
BOYS HAVE SPERM.

28:14.463 --> 28:16.796
EXCUSE ME?

28:16.796 --> 28:19.398
WE NEED TO TALK.

28:23.332 --> 28:26.375
SO APPARENTLY, AFTER WE HAD
OUR LITTLE CHAT WITH JUANITA,

28:26.375 --> 28:28.377
SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO BETHANY

28:28.377 --> 28:31.140
AND PASSED ON THE FACTS OF LIFE
IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL.

28:31.140 --> 28:34.443
WELL, DID YOU EXPLAIN TO PEGGY
WHY WE HAD THE LITTLE CHAT?
 SHE DIDN'T WANNA HEAR IT,

28:34.443 --> 28:36.445
NOT WITH BETHANY
RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE,

28:36.445 --> 28:38.818
SCREAMING "INTERCOURSE!"
AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.291
(sighs)
SO WE'RE OUT OF THE PLAYDATE?
 OH, YEAH. WAY OUT.

28:44.453 --> 28:46.826
WELL, I GUESS IT'S BACK
TO THE OLD SCHEDULE

28:46.826 --> 28:49.158
OF TEN MINUTES OF
GROPE 'N SNORE AT MIDNIGHT.

28:49.158 --> 28:51.160
I'M NOT GOING BACK, CARLOS.
I CAN'T.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.402
IF JUANITA DOESN'T GET
HER PLAYDATE,

28:53.402 --> 28:56.806
YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOURS.
 FINE. I WILL FIX IT.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY

28:56.806 --> 28:59.308
PEGGY'S MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS.

28:59.308 --> 29:01.040
SPERM!

29:02.912 --> 29:07.346
JUANITA! STOP TALKING
TO YOUR SISTER!

29:10.049 --> 29:12.351
ORSON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE GUEST BEDROOM?

29:12.351 --> 29:14.283
OH, I COULDN'T SLEEP.

29:14.283 --> 29:16.856
YOU WERE SNORING
TOO LOUDLY.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.257
ME? SNORING?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.260
MM, LIKE A DONKEY
WITH A HEAD COLD.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.332
HONEY, I DON'T SNORE.

29:23.332 --> 29:25.434
OH, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
HEAR YOURSELF.

29:25.434 --> 29:27.366
BUT I HEAR YOU...

29:27.366 --> 29:29.038
LOUD AND CLEAR.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.043
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES,
COME BACK TO BED.

29:34.043 --> 29:36.775
(sighs) NO.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.447
I'M GOOD HERE.

29:38.447 --> 29:39.778
(click)

29:54.523 --> 29:56.395
HEY, MIKE. DAVE WILLIAMS.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.397
LOOK, HATE TO BOTHER YOU,

29:58.397 --> 30:00.799
BUT I GOT A BUSTED PIPE
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.801
PROBABLY SOME KIDS
PLAYING A PRANK.
 NO PROBLEM.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.803
I'M ACROSS TOWN
FINISHING UP ON ANOTHER JOB.

30:04.803 --> 30:09.438
SO DEPENDING ON TRAFFIC,
GIVE ME... SAY AN HOUR?
 OH, THANKS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

30:09.438 --> 30:10.940
(beep)

30:13.983 --> 30:15.284
(grunts)

30:23.292 --> 30:26.295
SO WHEN JUANITA THOUGHT THAT
I MIGHT BE HURTING HER MOTHER,

30:26.295 --> 30:28.527
WE DECIDED IT WAS BEST
THAT SHE KNEW THE TRUTH.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.530
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT
THING TO DO AT THE TIME.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.062
SEE, HONEY?

30:33.062 --> 30:35.965
I-I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE
A RATIONAL EXPLANATION.

30:35.965 --> 30:37.836
WELL...

30:37.836 --> 30:39.838
I GUESS
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

30:39.838 --> 30:42.271
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE.

30:42.271 --> 30:44.143
(sighs and chuckles nervously)

30:44.143 --> 30:46.445
SO... DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE

30:46.445 --> 30:49.518
JUANITA COULD REJOIN
YOUR PLAYDATE?
 WE'VE TALKED TO HER.

30:49.518 --> 30:51.981
SHE WILL NEVER DISCUSS SEX
EVER AGAIN.

30:51.981 --> 30:56.225
NOT IF SHE WANTS TO SEE
HER FAVORITE DOLLY ALIVE.

30:56.225 --> 30:57.526
(under breath) GABY,
WE DON'T NEED TO LET THEM KNOW

30:57.526 --> 31:00.089
ALL OF
OUR PARENTING SECRETS.

31:00.089 --> 31:02.491
I... THINK THAT'D BE OKAY.

31:02.491 --> 31:04.964
I PROBABLY OVERREACTED.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.037
WE JUST WANNA KEEP BETHANY'S
INNOCENCE AS LONG AS WE CAN.

31:08.037 --> 31:09.498
OH, WE TOTALLY AGREE.

31:09.498 --> 31:13.042
KIDS ARE FORCED TO GROW UP
WAY TOO FAST THESE DAYS.
 NO KIDDING.

31:13.042 --> 31:16.045
I WANT MY GIRLS TO BELIEVE IN
SANTA CLAUS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

31:16.045 --> 31:19.248
THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT SOON
ENOUGH THAT IT'S ALL A LIE.
 (laughs)

31:19.248 --> 31:20.309
(Bethany) WHAT?

31:20.309 --> 31:22.651
THERE'S NO SANTA CLAUS?!

31:25.084 --> 31:29.358
(sobbing)

31:29.358 --> 31:31.560
SO...

31:31.560 --> 31:35.064
NEXT PLAYDATE'S
MONDAY AT 1:00?

31:35.064 --> 31:37.366
WOW, WHOEVER DID THIS
REALLY WENT TO TOWN.

31:37.366 --> 31:39.468
(laughs) YEAH, I KNOW.
DAMN KIDS.

31:39.468 --> 31:41.170
BY THE WAY,

31:41.170 --> 31:43.472
DID YOU PUT ANY MORE THOUGHT
INTO JOINING THE BAND?

31:43.472 --> 31:46.475
OH, MAN. I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO GET BACK TO YOU.

31:46.475 --> 31:48.377
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

31:48.377 --> 31:50.379
BUT I'M REALLY
STRETCHED THIN THESE DAYS.

31:50.379 --> 31:52.341
OH, COME ON. EVERY MAN'S
GOT TIME FOR A LITTLE MUSIC.

31:52.341 --> 31:54.343
BELIEVE ME, I'D LOVE TO PLAY
WITH YOU GUYS,

31:54.343 --> 31:57.386
BUT, UH, I LIVE 30 MINUTES
AWAY--AN HOUR IN TRAFFIC.

31:57.386 --> 32:00.389
WHATEVER TIME
I'VE GOT LEFT'S FOR MY SON.
 YEAH, I HEAR YA.

32:00.389 --> 32:03.322
HEY, YOU EVER LOOK INTO
LIVING A LITTLE CLOSER BY?

32:03.322 --> 32:05.324
(laughs) WITH THE RENT PRICES
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.526
I MIGHT PLAY GUITAR
LIKE A ROCK STAR,

32:07.526 --> 32:10.529
BUT I DON'T EARN LIKE ONE.
 (laughs) YEAH. SORRY.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.232
I WASN'T THINKING.
 OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.504
UH, APPRECIATE YOU
TRYING TO HELP.

32:15.504 --> 32:18.507
BELIEVE ME,
I WISH I COULD DO MORE.

32:22.171 --> 32:24.413
(indistinct conversations)

32:24.413 --> 32:27.946
I'VE NEVER SEEN BREE
SO HAPPY. SHE'S GLOWING.

32:27.946 --> 32:31.550
SHE WON'T BE GLOWING
WHEN THAT AGENCY SINKS HER BOOK.
 (scoffs) LYNETTE...

32:31.550 --> 32:34.553
I'M TELLING YOU, THE ONLY THING
STALER THAN THAT AD CAMPAIGN

32:34.553 --> 32:38.357
IS THIS DINNER ROLL.
 YEAH, AND THE WATER WAS
AS FLAT AS THE AD CAMPAIGN.

32:38.357 --> 32:42.291
YOUR MARTINI WAS AS DRY
AS THE AD CAMPAIGN. LET IT GO.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.293
HI, EVERYBODY!
YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?
 HI!

32:44.293 --> 32:45.334
HEY, BEAUTIFUL!

32:45.334 --> 32:47.596
UM ,THIS IS--
 STU!

32:47.596 --> 32:50.439
LYNETTE SCAVO.
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE YOU.
 HEY!

32:50.439 --> 32:51.570
HEY.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.373
EVERYONE, THIS IS
MY OLD ASSISTANT,

32:54.373 --> 32:57.146
STU, UM... DURBER. (laughs)
 DURBER.

32:57.146 --> 33:00.349
HEY!
WELL, THIS WAS ONE GREAT GUY.

33:00.349 --> 33:02.711
HE WOULD SCHLEP
ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN

33:02.711 --> 33:05.084
JUST TO GET ME
MY CHINESE FOOD.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.655
SO...

33:06.655 --> 33:08.457
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

33:08.457 --> 33:11.560
ACTUALLY, STU'S COMPANY
IS DOING ALL MY ADVERTISING.

33:15.024 --> 33:17.366
YOUR COMPANY?
YOU HAVE A COMPANY?

33:17.366 --> 33:20.099
THREE YEARS NOW.
 HUH.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.601
HOW ABOUT YOU? ARE YOU STILL
AT, UH, PARCHER & MURPHY?

33:22.601 --> 33:25.204
NO, I... ALSO WENT
INTO BUSINESS FOR MYSELF.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.206
HER PLACE MAKES
THE BEST PIZZA IN TOWN.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.508
YOU OWN A PIZZERIA?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.240
WELL,
IT'S REALLY MY HUSBAND'S.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.342
AND I'M STILL DOING
SOME FREELANCE STUFF.

33:33.342 --> 33:36.345
WELL, THAT'S GREAT. YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ALWAYS WORKING LATE.
 MM-HMM. OH.

33:36.345 --> 33:39.648
GIVE ME YOUR CARD.
WE'LL ORDER FROM YOU SOME NIGHT.
 OH.

33:39.648 --> 33:42.020
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE,
WE'RE ACROSS TOWN,

33:42.020 --> 33:44.353
SO IT MAY BE A BIT
OF A SCHLEP.
 OH! (laughs)

33:44.353 --> 33:46.525
IT WAS GREAT CATCHING UP,
LYNETTE.
 YEAH.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.498
BREE, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOME PEOPLE.
 YEAH, MM. GREAT.

34:03.412 --> 34:05.714
(chuckles)
THERE'S MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

34:05.714 --> 34:08.147
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

34:08.147 --> 34:10.449
WHY? LOOKING FOR A REASON
TO SCREAM AT ME?

34:10.449 --> 34:13.152
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WAS AWFUL THE OTHER DAY.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.123
HOW ABOUT
I MAKE IT UP TO YOU

34:15.123 --> 34:17.686
BY BUYING YOU
MRS. HUDSON'S HOUSE?

34:17.686 --> 34:20.458
SERIOUSLY?
 WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND I AGREE.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.331
IT'S A GOOD
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

34:23.331 --> 34:25.264
OH! THANK YOU!
(making kissing sounds)

34:25.264 --> 34:29.168
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
 THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

34:29.168 --> 34:33.242
AND I PROMISE THAT WE'LL RENT
THAT PLACE OUT FOR TOP DOLLAR.

34:33.242 --> 34:35.543
OH, I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THAT.

34:35.543 --> 34:39.478
BUT FIRST...
I WANT TO DO SOMEONE A FAVOR.
 (fizz)

34:39.478 --> 34:43.482
(cell phone rings)

34:43.482 --> 34:45.484
(beep)
 HI.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.656
WHERE ARE YOU?
IT'S AFTER 2:00.

34:47.656 --> 34:49.658
I'M GETTING READY
FOR MY JOB INTERVIEW.

34:49.658 --> 34:52.161
OH, THAT'S NOT UNTIL 4:00.

34:52.161 --> 34:54.163
I'M READING
THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORTS.

34:54.163 --> 34:56.425
I WANT TO BE PREPARED.

34:56.425 --> 34:58.767
OH, HONEY.
EVERYBODY'S ASKING ABOUT YOU.

34:58.767 --> 35:01.830
I WANT YOU TO BE HERE.
IT'S MY BIG DAY.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.473
WELL...

35:04.473 --> 35:05.704
ENJOY IT.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.506
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.438
(beep)

35:17.316 --> 35:18.447
OOH!

35:18.447 --> 35:21.320
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS TASTES LIKE?
MORE.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.621
IT WOULD SEEM

35:22.621 --> 35:25.524
SOMEBODY'S TAKING THEIR
DESIGNATED DRIVER POSITION...

35:25.524 --> 35:28.227
(whispers) A LITTLE LIGHTLY.
 (Lynette) STU?

35:28.227 --> 35:31.700
STU IS DOING
BREE'S AD CAMPAIGN?

35:31.700 --> 35:34.733
I RODE IN HIS HATCHBACK ONCE.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.366
IT SMELLED LIKE MU SHU.

35:37.366 --> 35:39.668
I GOTTA WARN HER.
 OH, WAIT! NO, HONEY.

35:39.668 --> 35:42.571
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
TILL AFTER THE CEREMONY?

35:42.571 --> 35:45.574
YEAH, JUST UNTIL YOU CAN BLINK
BOTH EYES AT THE SAME TIME.

35:45.574 --> 35:48.717
GUYS, I AM JUST GONNA OFFER
HER A LITTLE ADVICE. GEESH.

35:48.717 --> 35:50.219
(splatters)
 (gasps)

35:50.219 --> 35:52.351
OH!
 (gasps)

35:52.351 --> 35:54.183
WHOOP. STILL WAITING.

35:54.183 --> 35:56.185
(Stu) THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THE INTERNET IS THAT

35:56.185 --> 35:58.427
WITH A MINIMAL INVESTMENT,
YOU ACTUALLY CAN REACH

35:58.427 --> 36:01.490
ALL YOUR SPECIFIC
TARGET AUDIENCE--
 COUPONS.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.232
COUPONS?

36:03.232 --> 36:07.396
DO A CROSS-PROMOTION WITH SOME
OF THE MAJOR FOOD COMPANIES.

36:07.396 --> 36:09.598
KNOCK OFF 20%

36:09.598 --> 36:13.402
ON SOME OF THE ITEMS
FEATURED IN YOUR RECIPES,

36:13.402 --> 36:15.404
THEN THEY DO THE SAME

36:15.404 --> 36:18.507
TOWARDS THE PURCHASE
OF YOUR COOKBOOK.

36:18.507 --> 36:20.449
YEAH, OUR RESEARCH SHOWS,
YOU KNOW,

36:20.449 --> 36:22.751
PEOPLE AREN'T SO HOT
ON GIMMICKS--
 ZIP IT, STEWIE.

36:22.751 --> 36:25.514
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US,
PLEASE?

36:26.815 --> 36:29.718
(lowers voice)
LYNETTE, YOU'RE DRUNK.

36:29.718 --> 36:31.460
(lowers voice)
YEAH, THAT'S IMMATERIAL.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.462
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE COUPONS?

36:33.462 --> 36:36.795
LYNETTE, I AM REALLY NOT ABLE
TO DEAL WITH THAT RIGHT NOW.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.867
OH. I KNOW.

36:38.867 --> 36:41.430
YOU'VE GOT YOUR BOOK
AND--AND YOUR BIG FANCY AWARD,

36:41.430 --> 36:43.432
AND I'M JUST A HOUSEWIFE.

36:43.432 --> 36:45.804
I NEVER SAID THAT.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.507
YOU KNOW, WHEN I HAD
A HIGH-POWERED CAREER,

36:48.507 --> 36:52.281
AND YOU WERE JUST A HOUSEWIFE,
I NEVER LOOKED DOWN ON YOU.

36:52.281 --> 36:55.314
IF YOU COULD ALL PLEASE
TAKE YOUR SEATS,

36:55.314 --> 36:57.616
IT'S TIME
TO PRESENT OUR AWARD.

36:59.648 --> 37:02.491
YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW.

37:02.491 --> 37:05.254
FINE. AND DON'T WORRY.

37:05.254 --> 37:08.427
EVEN THOUGH I'D LIKE TO, I'M NOT
GONNA MAKE SOME BIG, UGLY SCENE.

37:08.427 --> 37:13.432
(alarm blaring, guests gasp)

37:17.736 --> 37:20.809
(alarm continues blaring,
door shuts)

37:28.917 --> 37:30.279
HI.

37:30.279 --> 37:32.281
HEY. I, UM,
I BOUGHT M.J. SOME STILTS,

37:32.281 --> 37:35.284
THOUGHT I'D TEACH HIM
HOW TO USE 'EM.

37:35.284 --> 37:37.826
HAR HAR. UH, ACTUALLY, HE'S AT
JUANITA'S WATCHING A DVD.

37:37.826 --> 37:39.828
DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL HIM?

37:39.828 --> 37:43.292
NO. NO, IT'S COOL. I JUST WANTED
TO TELL HIM ABOUT MY NEW PLACE.

37:43.292 --> 37:44.763
(sighs)
YOU'RE MOVING AGAIN?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.366
HOW FAR
ARE YOU GONNA BE AWAY NOW?

37:50.799 --> 37:53.402
THE HUDSON HOUSE?
 YEAH, SHE SOLD IT.

37:53.402 --> 37:56.405
AND EDIE TOLD ME THE NEW OWNER
WANTS TO RENT IT,

37:56.405 --> 37:58.577
SO NOW I'LL HAVE
A FIGHTING CHANCE

37:58.577 --> 38:01.410
OF BEING AROUND
WHEN M.J. HITS HIS MILESTONES.

38:01.410 --> 38:03.412
IS THIS OKAY WITH YOU?

38:03.412 --> 38:04.553
(chuckles)

38:04.553 --> 38:07.586
YEAH. IT'S GREAT.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.559
UH, WE'LL BE LIKE...

38:10.559 --> 38:12.961
ONE BIG, HAPPY,
DIVORCED FAMILY.

38:12.961 --> 38:14.663
YOU SURE?

38:14.663 --> 38:17.596
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

38:17.596 --> 38:21.330
I--I BUT, YOU KNOW,
M.J. WILL BE THRILLED, AND...

38:21.330 --> 38:23.332
YEAH, I'M FINE WITH IT.

38:23.332 --> 38:25.334
GOOD.

38:25.334 --> 38:27.476
SO, UM...

38:27.476 --> 38:29.638
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND,
NEIGHBOR.

38:29.638 --> 38:31.340
(chuckles)

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
I STILL THINK IT'S STRANGE

38:38.316 --> 38:41.089
YOU WON'T LET ME TELL MIKE
THAT WE'RE THE NEW OWNERS.

38:41.089 --> 38:43.522
WELL, THE MAN'S GOT
A LOT OF PRIDE.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.525
I WANT HIM TO FEEL LIKE I'M
HIS NEIGHBOR, NOT HIS LANDLORD.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.497
LANDLORD? HELL, WITH THE RENT
WE'RE CHARGING HIM,

38:48.497 --> 38:49.998
YOU'RE HIS FAIRY GODMOTHER.

38:49.998 --> 38:53.001
ALL RIGHT, CONSIDER IT
AN INVESTMENT IN GOOD KARMA.
 SCREW KARMA.

38:53.001 --> 38:55.634
I FINALLY DO SOMETHING NICE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

38:55.634 --> 38:58.637
AND I CAN'T EVEN
BRAG ABOUT IT?

38:58.637 --> 39:01.470
THE MAN WHO IS SILENT
IN HIS GOOD DEEDS

39:01.470 --> 39:04.643
IS THE MAN WHO REAPS
THE GREATEST REWARD.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.519
(knock on door)

39:11.650 --> 39:13.051
HEY.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.853
HI.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.385
SO...

39:16.385 --> 39:17.686
GIVE ME SOME GUIDANCE.

39:17.686 --> 39:21.490
DO I GROVEL, SEND FLOWERS,
OR...

39:21.490 --> 39:22.831
JUST MOVE?

39:22.831 --> 39:24.833
I'M NOT ANGRY WITH YOU.

39:24.833 --> 39:26.995
I'M JUST SORRY
THAT YOU FELT SO--

39:26.995 --> 39:29.097
DRUNK? JEALOUS?

39:29.097 --> 39:32.601
(scoffs) YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE JEALOUS OF.

39:32.601 --> 39:34.643
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

39:34.643 --> 39:36.605
YOU ARE HAVING
THE KIND OF SUCCESS

39:36.605 --> 39:39.608
I ONLY DREAMED OF
BACK IN MY AD DAYS.

39:39.608 --> 39:42.551
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I LOOK DOWN ON YOU.

39:42.551 --> 39:45.884
NO. BUT WATCHING YOU,
 I LOOK DOWN ON ME.

39:45.884 --> 39:50.589
WHEN I HELD YOUR BOOK
IN MY HANDS,

39:50.589 --> 39:53.722
I FELT SO JEALOUS
MY STOMACH HURT.

39:53.722 --> 39:57.726
AND I THOUGHT, IF I COULD
JUST HITCH A RIDE,

39:57.726 --> 39:59.728
HAVE A PIECE OF IT,

39:59.728 --> 40:03.001
I WOULDN'T FEEL SO BAD
ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.504
FOR GOD SAKES, LYNETTE,
STOP CALLING ME A SUCCESS.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.577
THERE'S NOTHING SUCCESSFUL
ABOUT ME.

40:08.577 --> 40:09.838
(sighs)

40:11.580 --> 40:13.882
MY FRIENDS THINK
I'M GONNA DROP THEM,

40:13.882 --> 40:15.714
MY PARTNER RESENTS ME,

40:15.714 --> 40:17.716
AND MY HUSBAND...

40:19.888 --> 40:22.591
(whispers) HAS MOVED
INTO THE GUEST BEDROOM.

40:24.953 --> 40:28.056
EVERYTHING I GAIN
COMES AT SOME HORRIBLE PRICE,

40:28.056 --> 40:31.760
AND I'M STARTING TO WONDER
IF ANY OF IT'S EVEN WORTH IT.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.762
IT IS.

40:36.605 --> 40:38.907
YOU'RE AT THE START
OF AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY,

40:38.907 --> 40:42.711
AND I AM GOING TO BE THERE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

40:42.711 --> 40:44.643
CHEERING YOU ON,

40:44.643 --> 40:46.775
TELLING ANYONE
WHO WILL LISTEN

40:46.775 --> 40:50.719
THAT THE BREE VAN DE KAMP
IS MY FRIEND.

40:50.719 --> 40:53.682
(whispers) THANKS.

40:53.682 --> 40:57.125
AND THE REST
OF THE STUFF...

40:57.125 --> 40:59.688
YOU'LL FIND A WAY
TO FIX IT.

40:59.688 --> 41:05.133
JUST KNOW THAT ALL YOUR FRIENDS
ARE VERY PROUD OF YOU.

41:07.696 --> 41:10.769
BITTERLY JEALOUS, BUT PROUD.

41:21.650 --> 41:22.911
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY

41:22.911 --> 41:25.784
INTO THE FACES
OF THOSE AROUND YOU,

41:25.784 --> 41:27.786
YOU WILL CATCH A GLIMPSE

41:27.786 --> 41:30.619
OF A CERTAIN
GREEN-EYED MONSTER.

41:34.963 --> 41:38.867
AND THEN YOU'LL SEE
THEY ENVY YOUR CAREER...

41:44.603 --> 41:46.875
YOUR LOVE LIFE...

41:53.882 --> 41:57.215
THE TIME YOU SPEND
WITH THEIR CHILD...

42:03.552 --> 42:07.656
HOW DO YOU DEAL
WITH SUCH JEALOUSY?

42:12.731 --> 42:14.863
THERE ARE MANY WAYS.

42:17.005 --> 42:19.167
BUT THE BEST...

42:19.167 --> 42:21.970
IS TO SIMPLY SHARE

42:21.970 --> 42:23.812
WHAT YOU HAVE.

42:27.115 --> 42:30.619
THANK YOU.

42:30.619 --> 42:32.120
MMM.

42:34.282 --> 42:37.856
PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
LEAVE OUR BED AGAIN.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.028
I PROMISE...

42:40.028 --> 42:41.690
PARTNER.
