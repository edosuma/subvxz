WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:10.200
Terrance, we're nearing the end
of our programme,

00:10.500 --> 00:12.500
and we haven't gotten
to the heart of your problem.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.100
TERRANCE [ON PHONE]:
<i>I guess I'm just sick of being single.</i>

00:15.500 --> 00:17.900
<i>I mean, I'm almost 40.</i>
<i>What kind of loser am I?</i>

00:18.200 --> 00:20.600
A single man in his 40s
is not a loser.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.400
TERRANCE: <i>I said I'm almost 40.</i>
<i>Don't make it sound worse than it is.</i>

00:25.100 --> 00:27.200
- Can I jump in here, Frasier?
- Please.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.800
Listen, Terrance, I know that I'm not
as old as you, or Frasier,

00:31.100 --> 00:34.900
but I've been through
plenty of heartache and loneliness.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.200
I remember thinking,
"Love is never gonna come to me."

00:38.400 --> 00:39.600
So I gave up.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.800
And that is when a handsome,
sweet-hearted man named Roger

00:44.200 --> 00:48.000
jumped off his garbage truck
and into my life.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
And I have been deliriously happy
ever since.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.400
And I feel sure that the same thing
will happen for you.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.300
TERRANCE:
<i>I have to give up on love first?</i>

00:55.500 --> 00:57.200
No, I'm saying don't give up.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.200
TERRANCE: <i>But you said you met</i>
<i>this garbage man after you gave up.</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:02.600
Terrance, I think what Roz
is trying to say

01:02.800 --> 01:05.400
is that whether
we seek love or not,

01:05.800 --> 01:09.500
we are always at the mercy
of its mysterious rhythm.

01:09.700 --> 01:13.000
- Exactly.
TERRANCE: <i>That's not what she said.</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:16.600
I think we know why this guy's
still single.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.800
This is Dr. Frasier Crane
saying good day, Seattle,

01:20.100 --> 01:22.500
and good mental health.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.200
- Your dad called during the segment.
- Oh, great.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.900
- Here's the number.
- Thank you.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.600
He's working
the early shift today.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.500
We're gonna have dinner together
this evening.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.400
Oh, I'm going out to dinner too.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.600
Yes. With Roger.
You mentioned that.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.900
Did I tell you he's taking me
on a moonlight picnic?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
Yes, you did.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.200
- In a canoe?
- Check.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.600
How romantic is that?

01:43.900 --> 01:47.900
He said all I had to bring was
my appetite for caviar and affection.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.000
I told him to bring his appetite
because I'll be wearing my edible...

01:51.200 --> 01:56.300
Dad. Hi. Yeah, uh, listen, um,
I've made our reservation for, uh...?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
- Oh.
- Sorry, Roz. Yes. Thanks.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.600
Yes, hello, is Martin Crane there,
please?

02:05.800 --> 02:08.100
Dad, hi. Look, I made a reservation
for, uh, 7:30,

02:08.300 --> 02:10.600
so I'll pick you up around 7:15,
all right? And...

02:11.000 --> 02:12.200
Oh.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.900
Oh, dear.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.700
Hey, you know what?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Why don't I stop by with a pizza?

02:18.300 --> 02:21.100
Okay, great. I'll see you then.
Bye.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.100
More flowers from Roger.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.400
And you have to hear this poem
he wrote me.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.300
Hang on a second, Dad.
I, uh...

02:28.500 --> 02:30.200
I've gotta get a pen.
I'll write that down.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.500
Sorry, Roz.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
Good night, Marty.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.000
See you tomorrow, Babs.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.900
- Hey, mister. Pizza delivery.
- Hey, you made it.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.800
Oh, that smells good.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.200
What kind did you get?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.000
Prosciutto and fontina.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.800
Oh, I had my heart set
on a ham-and-cheeser.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.200
Oh, you were just messing with me.
Good one, Fras.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.100
FRASIER: There you are.
MARTIN: Ha-ha-ha.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.300
- Uh-oh. My boss is coming.
- Where?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.100
I can see him on the monitors.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.400
I'd love to meet him.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.400
How many times do I have to tell you
to stay off this damn frequency?

03:10.700 --> 03:13.600
Uh, maybe you could just go
read the directory for a minute.

03:14.700 --> 03:15.700
Uh-uh.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.100
- Food has to stay out of sight, Crane.
- Oh, right.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.900
- Oh, I'll take a slice though.
- Oh, sure.

03:22.300 --> 03:25.400
Hey, did you notice anyone
messing with the camera

03:25.700 --> 03:26.800
in the East Tower?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.900
That was me. The way it was pointed,
you couldn't really see the stairs.

03:30.300 --> 03:31.800
So you left your post?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.100
- I thought that it made more sense...
- We don't pay you to think, Crane.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.500
We pay you to watch the monitors
and keep the sign-in sheet in order.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.400
We also pay you to button
the top button on your shirt.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.800
See you tomorrow, fellas.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.500
- Good night.
- Good night, now.

03:47.700 --> 03:48.800
Maybe when you were a cop,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.200
you could play fast and loose
with the rules.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.800
But here at Keckner Security,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.900
regulations have to be followed.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.700
Yes, sir. Do you want to look over
the sign-in sheet?

03:57.900 --> 03:59.100
Do you need any help?

03:59.400 --> 04:02.300
Oh. Uh, I'm... I'm sorry, no.
No, thank you.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.900
You hate to ask for help, huh?

04:05.200 --> 04:08.100
You know what people
who never ask questions never get?

04:08.700 --> 04:09.600
Answers.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.500
[CHUCKLES]

04:12.300 --> 04:14.200
Very interesting. Yes, uh...

04:15.100 --> 04:17.899
Oh, there it is.
Uh, UCB Industries.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.200
- You're a UCB man?
- Yes.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.400
- I'm with DNR Associates.
- Ah.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.000
So I guess, uh, technically,
we shouldn't be talking, but, uh,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.400
who takes that corporate competition
stuff seriously anymore?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.100
I do.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
Ah.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.700
Look, Crane, you really want to put
that busy brain of yours to work,

04:38.100 --> 04:42.200
why don't you mastermind a way
to lift the pizza stain out of your tie?

04:46.700 --> 04:48.500
I can't believe the way
that guy talked to you.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.100
Oh, it's no big deal.
Why don't you just go home?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.800
- But he has no right to do that.
- Just go home.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.600
All right.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.100
- I'll see you there.
MARTIN: Okay.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.200
Well,

05:06.300 --> 05:08.100
this is awkward.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.300
Especially with the, uh, Reliance
Bearings account up for grabs.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.000
But whoever wins it, wins it.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.700
Good luck.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.800
Don't you mean
congratulations?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.900
- You're kidding.
- An hour ago.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.900
Don't they ever cc
you guys on this stuff?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.100
NILES:
You're not exaggerating?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.800
I tell you, Niles,
I stood there slack-jawed

05:41.100 --> 05:43.700
as Dad was reprimanded
like an errant child.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.400
Maybe his boss
was having a tough day

05:45.700 --> 05:47.200
and needed someone
to take it out on.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.700
Sometimes an employer gets
so caught up in his own world that he...

05:51.100 --> 05:52.600
I mean, after all, this is a man

05:54.300 --> 05:55.800
who served his country in Korea,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.800
who had a distinguished career
as a detective,

05:58.100 --> 06:01.400
and yet he is being treated the way you
would treat a grocery-store bag boy.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.400
What does that mean?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.700
Don't play coy with me
just because Daphne's here.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
I have seen you when your avocados
are packed under your ice cream.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.800
Excuse me.
That young man was on drugs,

06:13.100 --> 06:15.100
and everyone in the store knew it.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.700
MARTIN: Hey.
NILES: Hey, Dad.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.800
FRASIER: Dad.
- Mr. Crane. How was work today?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.900
Oh, same old, same old.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.500
Boy, I'm beat.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.900
Eight hours of staring
at those monitors

06:30.200 --> 06:33.100
can really wear you out. Ah.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.200
So, Dad, did you speak
with your supervisor?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
Oh, don't start this again.
Everything's fine.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.500
Dad, after the way
that man eviscerated you?

06:44.800 --> 06:46.900
That's just Rich.
He's one of those tough guys.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.700
It's no big deal.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.000
You're a tough guy.
Why don't you set him straight?

06:51.300 --> 06:52.900
I'm not gonna talk back to my boss.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.000
You have to respect
the chain of command.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.600
It's not easy, but that's the way
I've always done it.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.600
- So you're gonna sit there and take it?
- Come on, Fras. We're men.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.400
We know how to gut these things out.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.400
We don't whine and cry.
You know that.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.000
Ha!

07:07.900 --> 07:09.700
How true.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.700
You do know that, Dr. Crane.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.700
I'll bet the owner of the company

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
would like to know
how this Rich is behaving.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.000
The owner of the company
is Rich's son.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.400
Nepotism, huh? God, this problem
just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.300
- It's not a problem.
- Dad...

07:26.500 --> 07:29.400
Frasier, would you listen?
He said it's not a problem.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.500
Dad's more than capable
of handling himself.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.200
- Thank you.
- You see? He thinks you're out of line.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.500
- No, I just...
- No, Dad, Dad, I got this.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.400
You've gotta have at least
some kind of plan to deal with this guy.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.700
I've got a plan. Once Rich knows
I'm not fighting, he'll drop it.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.000
Which is what you guys are gonna do.
Now I'm tired of talking about this.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.000
See? Now you've made Dad tired.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.200
- Can it, Niles.
- And cranky.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.800
[CHATTERING]

07:57.000 --> 07:58.500
- Frasier Crane, right?
- Ah, yes, yes.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.300
I'm Charlie Keckner
of Keckner Security.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.400
Mr. Keckner, nice to meet you.
Please sit down.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.900
- Would you like some coffee?
- Nothing for me, thanks.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.500
- Thank you for meeting me like this.
- No problem.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.100
I like face-to-facing with new clients,
especially those in the public eye

08:11.400 --> 08:15.200
who need the kind of custom-tailored
security that we specialise in.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.000
So,

08:17.400 --> 08:19.300
what is it? Stalker, blackmailer,

08:19.500 --> 08:21.400
random nut job?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm sorry, but I'm not actually

08:26.700 --> 08:29.100
in the market
for security services.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.000
Oh, that's strange.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.700
Because
your phone message said:

08:32.900 --> 08:34.600
"I'm in the market
for security services."

08:34.799 --> 08:38.400
Yes, I can see how that
may have been misleading. I, uh...

08:39.000 --> 08:40.400
I wanted to meet you in person

08:40.600 --> 08:44.200
because I have, uh, a matter
of some delicacy to discuss with you.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.900
My father works for your company, and
I understand your father does as well.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.900
What does this have to do
with anything?

08:50.100 --> 08:54.200
Well, it seems that...

08:55.800 --> 08:58.200
...your dad has been
picking on my dad.

09:01.700 --> 09:02.900
What?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.700
That doesn't sound like my dad.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.500
Well, perhaps you don't know your dad
as well as you think you do.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.600
I saw the whole thing.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.200
Well, huh, maybe my dad
was just defending himself.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.000
Did your dad provoke him?

09:15.200 --> 09:18.900
No, no. I can assure you
that your dad started it.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.000
None of the other guards
has any trouble with my dad.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.000
Maybe your dad
needs to toughen up a little.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.700
My father fought in Korea.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.600
Did he? Or did you
fight the Koreans for him?

09:32.600 --> 09:37.700
Now, Charlie, I'm sure a man
of your inspired leadership

09:38.100 --> 09:41.000
has resolved conflicts
between employees before.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.400
- Hmm?
- Sure.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.200
It's that kind of
enlightened management

09:45.400 --> 09:48.600
that has made the name Keckner
synonymous with security.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.400
- All right, I'll look into it.
- Thank you so much.

09:52.700 --> 09:55.100
If you don't mind, could we keep
this meeting between us?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.700
I'd hate to have my father think
I went behind his back.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.000
You're asking me to conceal
something from my own father?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.000
I don't know if I can do that.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.900
On the other hand,
if you were a client,

10:06.100 --> 10:09.100
I'd be obligated
to keep this confidential.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.300
If you're implying what I think you are,
Mr. Keckner,

10:13.500 --> 10:16.500
I hope for your sake
you brought some brochures.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.200
Please.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.000
All right. Good night.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.900
- Hey, Rich.
- Hey, buddy.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.700
- Everything all right here?
- Uh, sure.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.500
Nothing to complain about, then?

10:36.400 --> 10:39.100
No. Want some coffee?

10:39.700 --> 10:42.700
No, no, no. I keep my eating
and drinking to the break room.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.900
That way nobody complains.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.500
Oh. Okay.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.400
Uh, I could use your initials
on my time card, if you've got a sec.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.300
Oh, for you, I've got all night.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.100
And I'll be sure to do it neatly

10:56.400 --> 10:59.500
so there'll be no complaints.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.200
Okay, what's going on?

11:02.300 --> 11:03.600
You tell me.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.500
My son chewed me out
for being too tough on the guards.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.500
I wonder who might have put him up
to that.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.900
- It could have been any of the guys.
- I think it was you.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.900
- It wasn't me. I'm not a complainer.
- Good.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.100
Then you won't complain about doing
a few graveyard shifts next week.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.300
- No problem.
- Good.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.000
How's Tuesday, Wednesday
work for you?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.600
- Actually, that's not so good.
- Oh.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.100
Then how's Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.700
Better.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.500
Hey, Niles.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.200
- Hey, Daphne.
- Hi, Roz.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
I called you this morning.
Where were you?

11:43.300 --> 11:45.500
Sleeping. Mr. Crane's
been working the overnight shift.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.300
It's thrown my whole schedule off.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.900
Oh. Roger and I have been working
overnight too, if you know what I mean.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.600
Let me grab a muffin
and I'll tell you all about it.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.200
- Grab one for me too.
- Okay.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.700
So I can stick it in my ears.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.600
I'm a little tired of hearing about it.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.400
You're tired? I've heard double
whatever you have.

12:03.800 --> 12:08.300
Did you know Roger wrote her a song
to the tune of "I Believe I Can Fly"?

12:09.700 --> 12:11.700
I do now, don't I?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.600
Look, let's just not talk about Roger
this one time, okay?

12:14.800 --> 12:17.200
That's impossible.
She brings everything back to him.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.900
- Well, just leave it to me.
- Oh, good luck.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
So, what are you guys
talking about?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.700
Um, mediaeval French history.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.400
- I've always wanted to see Paris.
- Mm-hm. Thank you.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.900
Roger says he's gonna take me there
someday.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.900
He says you haven't truly
made love...

12:34.100 --> 12:36.300
- Oh, look at this.
- What?

12:36.500 --> 12:39.000
It says interest rates
might go down again.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.700
Just when we thought the interest
couldn't get any lower.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.200
I don't know about interest rates
and all that garbage. Oops.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.700
It's a good thing
Roger didn't hear that.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.000
He doesn't like it when I use garbage
in a derogatory way.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.200
Of course, he always forgives me.
Isn't he a doll?

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
Oh, you know, speaking of dolls,

12:58.800 --> 13:00.400
I understand
the Nordic Heritage Museum

13:00.600 --> 13:02.800
is planning a huge retrospective

13:03.100 --> 13:05.900
of Icelandic dolls
of the 19th century.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.700
Hmm. Is the Nordic Museum
the one near Sunset Hill?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.800
Roger and I had the best
bottle of wine there...

13:12.100 --> 13:13.300
NILES:
No.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.600
The Nordic Museum
is in Ballard.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.500
Oh, I guess I don't know
that place after all.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.000
Hmm. That exhibit sounds
fascinating, Niles. When is it?

13:25.300 --> 13:27.700
- February 14th.
- Valentine's Day?

13:28.500 --> 13:31.600
I guess I won't be there. Roger and I
are spending the whole day together.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.900
He says it's going to be full
of romantic surprises.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.300
But he gives me a romantic surprise
every single day.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.600
- This morning...
- I know girl talk when I hear it.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.400
Excuse me.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.000
Girl talk? He's the one
going to a doll museum.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.500
- Forget your coffee. Let's get out.
- What? And leave Daphne?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.300
It's too late for her.
We have to keep moving.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.300
Niles, I can't. I'm meeting Dad here
in a few minutes.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.300
His schedule's been so topsy-turvy
I haven't seen him in days.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.100
Still having trouble
with his supervisor?

14:01.400 --> 14:02.500
Well, yes.

14:02.700 --> 14:06.100
Yes, but I believe we'll be hearing
some good news on that front,

14:06.500 --> 14:08.200
no thanks to you.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
What does that mean?

14:09.700 --> 14:11.900
Let's just say
I took appropriate action.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.200
After Dad asked you
to butt out?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.400
If you had seen the way
this man treated Dad,

14:16.700 --> 14:18.800
I swear to God, you would have
done the same thing.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.100
- Perhaps.
- Thank you.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.000
I just wonder if you're doing this
for Dad or for yourself.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.800
- What are you on about now?
- Well, I just think it's telling

14:27.100 --> 14:29.900
that the whole thing bothers you
a lot more than it bothers Dad.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.500
You can't stand to see him
being bossed

14:32.800 --> 14:35.300
because to you, he's always been
this larger-than-life figure.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.100
And you're desperate
to keep that image intact.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.200
More importantly,

14:41.300 --> 14:43.200
why is that man staring at us?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.700
That's Sanchez, my bodyguard.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.200
It's only on a trial basis.
It's a long story.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.600
Oh, Dad. How you doing?

14:58.800 --> 15:00.700
I'm mad as hell,
that's how I'm doing.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.800
I just got beeped.
Rich wants me to work tonight.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.100
I'm gonna have to cancel
our dinner.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.200
- You haven't had a day off.
- I know.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.600
He thinks I went over his head
to complain about him,

15:12.800 --> 15:14.900
so now he's really
turning up the heat.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.200
No kidding.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.700
As if things weren't bad enough
for you already, Dad.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.300
MARTIN:
Yeah, I know.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.800
I used to take pride working through
tough spots like this,

15:23.200 --> 15:25.000
but I don't know if it's worth it
this time.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.400
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's nobody's fault.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.600
I'm just getting too old
for this sort of stuff.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.900
And if he keeps up with it,
I'm gonna call it quits.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.100
But that's a horrible idea. You can't run
from these kinds of problems.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.900
It only encourages the tormentors...
Where are you going?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.800
I'm gonna grab a quick nap
before my shift starts.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.600
I'm trying to help you
decide what to do.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.800
I know, that's what reminded me
to take a nap.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.700
Well done, Frasier.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.000
All right.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.100
My plan backfired.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.800
I guess there's only
one option left.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.500
- Tell Dad the truth.
- All right, two options.

15:58.300 --> 16:01.400
- I gotta go and speak directly to Rich.
- Don't you ever learn?

16:01.800 --> 16:04.100
He needs to know that Dad
is not the one who complained.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.300
Niles, come with me.
The two of us can help him together.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.600
Forget it. You know how I feel
about this. You're on your own.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.100
- Good news, dear.
- Hmm?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.300
Roz is gonna join us
for shopping today.

16:14.500 --> 16:18.900
Oh, no, I just promised Frasier
I'd help him with something.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.100
You know what Roger says
is the most erotic organ?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.000
- The mind?
- No.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.500
FRASIER: Well, he's not even here.
I can't believe this.

16:35.900 --> 16:39.000
I mean, after the way he came down
on Dad for doing the very same thing.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.800
I am not by nature a violent man,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.600
but I swear, if I have to,
I will page Sanchez.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.500
Okay, come down
in front up here.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.500
- I think you need to calm down.
- Yes, yes, you're right.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.100
I came here to talk to the man.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.700
- Still, the blood runs hot.
- I know.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.200
That's him. That's him.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.400
RICH:
Let me ask you something.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.200
Do they pay you
to fix the elevator

17:01.300 --> 17:04.500
or just spread your tools
all over my lobby?

17:05.099 --> 17:06.900
You ever hear of putting down
a drop cloth?

17:07.900 --> 17:10.400
By letting Dad handle this himself,
you'd be empowering him.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.400
And isn't that really
the greatest gift of all?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.099
I came down here
to stand up to that man.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.400
- The time for running is past.
MARTIN: Drive safely.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.599
- Dad's here.
- Oh, God, we can't let him see us.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.400
Come on.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.500
- Hey, Rich.
- Hey, Crane.

17:27.800 --> 17:28.800
You're early.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.800
Yeah, I thought I'd get a head start
on the checkpoints.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.400
Well, la-di-da.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.400
Great. Now what?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.300
Dad says he makes his rounds
every 20 minutes.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.700
We'll wait till the next one
and then slip out then.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.400
- Whoa, what's this?
- What's what?

17:44.700 --> 17:46.200
There's two guys
in the storage room.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.800
- Stay here. I'll take care of it.
- Oh, no, no!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Why not?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
MARTIN:
Those are my kids.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.000
What the hell are they doing
in the storage room?

17:57.300 --> 17:59.500
I don't know, but knowing them,
they probably came down

17:59.700 --> 18:01.500
to fight my battle for me.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.000
What battle?

18:03.200 --> 18:05.400
With you.
They know we don't get along.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.800
Wait a minute,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.600
they wouldn't be the ones who
complained about me, would they?

18:09.900 --> 18:11.400
Well, I wouldn't be surprised.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.000
They're always sticking their noses
into my business.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.000
That sounds like my kid.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.300
He thinks just because I work for him,
he's my boss.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.600
- Can you hear anything?
- No.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.000
But I guarantee you,
Rich is being a jerk.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.200
- I wish Dad would tell this guy off.
- That would make Dad feel better?

18:30.500 --> 18:32.600
I don't know, but it would
make me feel a lot better.

It's just that all our lives

18:43.500 --> 18:45.300
Dad's been the guy in charge.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.700
I just hate to see him
powerless like this.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.400
Well, how can you call him
powerless?

18:49.500 --> 18:52.400
The minute you saw him,
you ran into a storage closet.

- Shut up.

- Hmm?

- Yes.

Ammonia.

The thing fell 19 storeys
