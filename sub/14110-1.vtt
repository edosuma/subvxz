01:57.280 --> 02:01.200
- Walk the wall on the left!
- I need a line!

02:07.720 --> 02:12.440
I found her!
I found her!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.360
I need some help
down here!

02:16.480 --> 02:19.360
I need it now!

02:19.480 --> 02:22.440
Anybody hear me?

02:22.560 --> 02:25.280
Get down here now!

02:25.320 --> 02:27.200
Come on!

02:31.320 --> 02:34.600
Shepherd! Burr!

02:34.720 --> 02:37.240
I got her! I can't move!

02:37.320 --> 02:40.480
Come down here now!

02:42.080 --> 02:44.480
Hold on.
They'll be here.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.040
Move!

02:48.680 --> 02:51.200
- I heard a voice.
- Help me!

02:52.720 --> 02:54.840
I can't breathe!

02:54.960 --> 02:59.560
Help me! Help me out!
Help me out!

02:59.720 --> 03:02.680
Help me move it!

03:29.960 --> 03:32.720
Bring up the skycam.
Pan it left.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.120
Show me what God sees.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.280
Okay, camera two, show me the stands.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.600
- Three, give me the ice.
- Okay, graphic is up.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.560
Uh, put game seven on preset.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.000
How many technicians
are gonna be inside the arena?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.320
We got 12 cameramen,
6 support... that's 18.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.280
I want to limit their access.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.640
Technicians and announcers
are the only ones cleared.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.920
Hey, Spota, let us in.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.320
Work don't stop just 'cause the
Vice President's coming, you know, babe.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.240
Must be Republicans.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.640
Having everybody check in through one
gate like this is a pain in the butt.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.040
- It's only one night.
- It's the last game of the Stanley Cup.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.560
Having the Vice President
here turns a headache into a concussion.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.160
- I didn't vote for this guy.
- That's what makes what you're
doin' such a special gesture.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.040
Hello, Pittsburgh.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.880
Here we are in the seventh game of the
Stanley Cup finals. Penguins and Hawks.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.600
Penguins in a come-from-behind
victory to shut down the Hawks.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.120
Shit.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.760
Sorry. Uh, my dog's missing.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.720
We're out looking for him.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.120
- Is it bad?
- What? You think this might be good?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.280
- Let me see your license.
- Oh, sure.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.560
Move. Move.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.000
We are going to steal your car.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.720
Don't get killed over it, huh?

05:21.520 --> 05:24.160
It's the last game.
We got a couple of minutes to go.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.840
Just 15 seconds to go!

05:25.960 --> 05:28.600
He skates up to center.
He knocks down one defender.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.840
He's skating like a madman around
the ice. He gets to the blue line.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.840
He shoots. Whoa!
And he scores! Whoo!

05:34.960 --> 05:38.440
- Scratch my back with a hacksaw...
- Yes!

05:38.560 --> 05:40.480
Dad!

05:40.560 --> 05:42.040
Hey!

05:44.160 --> 05:46.360
- That's a fancy new stick.
- Michael gave it to me.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.640
- Hi.
- How are you, Darren?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.720
Darren, what are you
doing here?

05:50.840 --> 05:53.760
- You can't stay.
We're getting ready to leave.
- It's his birthday.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.040
And you've got him
all day tomorrow.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.080
I just got these.
I thought the kids might wanna...

05:59.200 --> 06:02.080
We're all going out
to dinner.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.280
- Looks like those are Penguin tickets.
- They are.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.120
It's the seventh game.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.200
- Vice President's gonna be there.
- Daddy! Daddy!

06:13.160 --> 06:15.920
- Hey, that's my hat!
- I can wear it. Mom said I could.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.840
I did?

06:19.240 --> 06:21.120
You know what that means?

06:23.320 --> 06:26.080
- Not a clue.
- It means "I love you."

06:27.160 --> 06:29.960
I love you too.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.160
She's practicing to be deaf,
but that's still my hat!

06:33.280 --> 06:37.320
- I'll get you a new one.
- You can't just take them
without talking to me first.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.440
- Besides, you only have two tickets.
- I'm working at the arena.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.880
- You're back to work, Dad?
- He's a fire inspector at the game.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.240
- It's very important work.
- Are you a fireman again, Daddy?

06:47.320 --> 06:50.560
Kind of, yeah.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.520
Kathi tells me it's only temporary.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.160
- He was trying to save a little
girl in a burning building...
- Are we going to the game?

06:59.640 --> 07:01.520
Don't do this again. I mean it.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.600
It's not fair to the kids... or me.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.560
I promise.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.720
Excuse me.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.000
This is Andrew.
He's the head chef.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.160
Nobody goes in that elevator,
and I mean nobody,

09:07.240 --> 09:09.800
even if they have proper I.D.,
unless this man says it's okay.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.000
If he doesn't know them,
they don't get in that elevator.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.480
After you finish the Vice President's
party, this kitchen is closed.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.600
- Have I made myself clear?
- Abundantly.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.200
That's how I like it.
Abundantly.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.240
Mrs. Ferrara?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.200
Yes?

09:48.320 --> 09:51.680
Let's just stroll into your house
like I'm your favorite nephew.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.240
- Ackerman, Ekers.
- Yeah.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.120
Come on, Mac. Mr. McCord makes sure
the building doesn't burn down.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.960
Go on through, Mr. Mac.
And who's this beauty?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.200
This is my daughter Emily
and my son Tyler.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.680
- Want a stamp?
- Love a stamp.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.920
Hey, can you guys play
after we get in?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.400
Hey, hold your horses.
I'm getting a stamp here.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.800
I'll never wash
this hand again.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.000
- See you later, Mr. Mac.
- Okay.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.560
- Joan.
- Hi, Darren.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.080
- Are you working tonight?
- After I take Tyler to the locker room.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.960
Hey, could you give Emily
a look at Icey?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.800
Icey always loves company. Come on,
Emily, I'm gonna show you where Icey is.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.480
Icey. Big deal.
Some fat guy in a ratty penguin suit.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.240
That blonde you're staring at,
she's the fat guy.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.560
- What's he doing?
- Shaping the blade.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.880
They're like horseshoes. You get 'em
hot enough, you can bend 'em.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.800
You, uh, recognize him?

11:20.840 --> 11:23.680
Yeah. Luc Robitaille.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.400
He waved at me.
You see that, Dad?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.360
Luc Robitaille waved at me.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.720
Come on, I'll introduce you.
He won't bite.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.400
- Luc, this is Tyler McCord
and his father Darren.
- Hi, Tyler. How are you?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.320
- Ca va?
- Bonjour.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.880
Dad, what did he say?

11:45.920 --> 11:47.800
He thinks, uh, they're gonna win.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.680
Hey, that's Brad Tolliver!

11:50.760 --> 11:52.960
- Dad, he doesn't have a rocking chair.
- A what?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.840
My dad said you should be sitting in
a rocking chair instead of on the ice.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.040
- Oh, is that so?
- You play hockey, Tyler?

11:59.200 --> 12:01.520
No, but my dad played.
He was a goalie.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.120
A little semi-pro in Canada.
It was a long time ago.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.080
Come by some afternoon.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.760
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.360
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.280
I can see the difference.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.760
I got this one, man.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.480
Yes.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.280
You boys have fun?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.520
Luc Robitaille talked to me,
and we saw Brad Tolliver close up.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.760
Your friends are gonna
be so jealous of you.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.160
- I wanna go with Icey.
- So does Tyler.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.040
Icey has to hit the stands, guys.
I'll see you later.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.960
Bye-bye.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.960
Andrew, this is Emily and Tyler.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.080
Pleasure.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.360
- Be right back.
- Come. I want to show you something.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.600
Whoa! Cool!

13:13.640 --> 13:16.240
That's why you won't hear
anyone complain about my cooking.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.880
- At least not to my face.
- You got a burnt-out light bulb.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.040
Could you change it?
I've got my hands full.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.960
Sure.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.520
Is that what Daddy does,
change light bulbs?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.680
No, Emily.
He's just helping out.

13:30.760 --> 13:34.080
- Firemen don't do that kind of stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

13:34.160 --> 13:36.920
- Uh, nothing.
- When are we gonna sit down?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.720
Frequent Flyer is in and on
his way to the locker room.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.640
Keep him moving.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.240
The Penguin fans are anxious
to see for the first time...

14:18.320 --> 14:22.040
- the Penguins kicking the Stanley Cup...
- Do you have any cookies?

14:22.080 --> 14:25.280
You force your way in here with a gun,
and now I have to feed you?

14:25.360 --> 14:28.640
You don't have to.
But I still have the gun.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.080
I think I have some Fig Newtons.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.600
Hey! Caution.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.720
Caution keeps you safe.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.440
I keep my machine gun
in with the produce.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.040
Okay, Veep's comin' in.
Let's get decent!

15:00.080 --> 15:02.080
Christ, Jefferson,
it's a locker room.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.280
Duckerman, why don't you
put on a jock?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.920
- Got any tape?
- You're covering the right head.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.320
Let's go, let's go.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.480
All right, guys, I'm privileged to
introduce Vice President Daniel Bender.

15:14.560 --> 15:18.040
He's a big hockey fan
and he'd like to say a few words.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.960
"A few words."
There's an optimist.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.680
I want to wish you all
the best of luck and, uh,

15:23.760 --> 15:25.880
are you Democrats
or Republicans?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.080
Neither, sir. Canadians.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.160
Well, in that case, good luck...

15:31.200 --> 15:34.040
and I hope to toast
your championship after the game.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.080
Sir, are you going to say the
same thing to the Blackhawks?

15:37.160 --> 15:39.920
Of course.
Nice outfit, Duckerman.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.440
Two nights ago with the Blackhawks
on the brink of elimination...

15:53.560 --> 15:56.160
It's time!

15:56.240 --> 15:58.880
I want you to pick up the phone...

15:58.960 --> 16:03.800
and dial 555-1793.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.880
- That's my husband's work number.
- It certainly is.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.480
When you get him on the line,

16:11.560 --> 16:15.400
- say only what's written on this.
- Ohh.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.480
Kitchen. Yeah. Hold on.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.400
Andrew, it's your wife.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.040
- Hello?
- Andy, it...

16:34.080 --> 16:36.800
We have your wife.
Follow her instructions.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.520
They will not hurt me...

16:44.640 --> 16:46.440
if you do as they say.

16:46.560 --> 16:51.160
If you give any indication something
is wrong, they will... kill me.

16:54.600 --> 16:59.720
When you go to the...
Vice President's box,

16:59.800 --> 17:03.400
you will take two new
assistants with you...

17:03.520 --> 17:05.560
escorted by
two security men.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.160
Get them into the box.
That's all you need to do.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.560
That's all you need to know.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.280
Who are these men?
How will I know them?

17:14.359 --> 17:17.160
In 30 seconds, you'll know.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.640
I swear this.
If you hurt my wife, I'll...

17:19.720 --> 17:23.000
You'll what?
Burn my toast?

17:31.880 --> 17:34.360
- Mr. Ferrara?
- Yes?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.960
Are these men yours?

17:41.960 --> 17:45.560
Yes. They're mine.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.720
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

17:53.800 --> 17:58.760
The National Hockey League presents
game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

17:58.840 --> 18:03.400
The Chicago Blackhawks
and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.480
As we get ready for the seventh and
final game of the Stanley Cup finals,

18:08.520 --> 18:11.920
you can feel the electricity in the air;
it sends a chill up your spine, Paul.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.640
One of these clubs is going to
skate with Lord Stanley's cup
here at Civic Arena Ice tonight.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.840
Listen to the crowd, Mike.
They're going crazy.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.200
Well, here's to a great game.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.880
Great if we win;
not so great if we lose.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.520
We are ready.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.600
Thank you, everybody.
You may leave now.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.560
Mr. Ferrara will close up
your stations.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.040
...singing of our National Anthem.

19:00.160 --> 19:05.880
Oh, say, can you see

19:05.920 --> 19:10.080
# By the dawn's
early light

19:10.120 --> 19:14.200
# What so proudly we hailed

19:14.240 --> 19:18.360
# At the twilight's
last gleaming

19:18.400 --> 19:20.920
- # Whose broad stripes
- What the hell are you...

19:21.000 --> 19:23.480
# And bright stars

19:23.560 --> 19:28.000
# Through the perilous fight

19:28.040 --> 19:32.680
# O'er the ramparts
we watched

19:32.800 --> 19:37.480
# Were so gallantly streaming

19:37.560 --> 19:41.760
# And the rockets'
red glare

19:41.880 --> 19:46.960
# The bombs bursting in air

19:47.040 --> 19:51.640
# Gave proof
through the night

19:51.680 --> 19:57.080
# That our flag
was still there

19:57.120 --> 20:00.000
- I love that part.
- # Oh, say does that

20:00.040 --> 20:02.560
- # Star-spangled
- Well, gotta go.

20:02.600 --> 20:08.920
# Banner yet wave

20:09.000 --> 20:12.720
# O'er the land

20:12.800 --> 20:15.680
# Of the free

20:15.760 --> 20:18.280
# And the home

20:18.400 --> 20:22.680
# Of the brave

20:32.360 --> 20:34.240
This place is going crazy right now.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.080
You could not beg, borrow or
steal a ticket before the game tonight.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.120
If you were packing heat,
you couldn't get in here.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.680
Eddie Belfour
starts in goal for Chicago.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.680
Amazingly, Brad Tolliver will play...

20:44.800 --> 20:47.840
even though he could hardly walk today
much less skate with a fever of 104.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.440
And here we go.
Game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.080
And the Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.440
They'll work into Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.560
Graham, slap shot!
Tolliver makes the save.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.360
Please, he needs a doctor.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.520
No!

21:06.600 --> 21:09.440
Not any more. Go ahead.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.680
Dead heroes get the best funerals.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.360
Thanks for your help, Andrew.

21:22.400 --> 21:26.560
His wife's recently deceased.
He would have been lonely without her.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.680
I hope that clarifies
the urgency of this mission.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.680
Only your best behavior's
gonna be good enough.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.600
That agent's name was Eddie Caline.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.960
He has a 5-year-old boy, a 3-year-old
little girl, and his wife's pregnant.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.360
- I'll send a card.
- What do you want?

21:40.440 --> 21:42.680
What do I want?

21:42.760 --> 21:46.000
World peace, an end to bigotry
and no more mini-malls.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.720
What am I gonna get?

21:49.760 --> 21:52.720
And I am gonna get it.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.160
That, boys and girls,
is really hot.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.240
- What is your objective?
- My objective?

21:58.360 --> 22:02.080
I get funny all over
when you talk like that.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.960
I know what you're thinking.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.680
Evaluate situation, calculate potential
losses and take appropriate action.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.600
Let me do that for you.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.120
The situation is hopeless.
The losses would be unacceptable.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.400
The appropriate action is to do nothing
and keep your fucking mouth shut.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.200
What kind of lunatic are you?

22:20.280 --> 22:23.160
The best kind.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.080
You can keep calling me names
if it makes you feel better.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.240
Throw me your earpiece
and your mike.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.800
Robitaille with a center pass.
That's just gonna miss.

22:45.880 --> 22:49.280
We are still scoreless in game seven,
period one, the Hawks and Pens.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.600
Watch Loeman.
He's got eyes in the back of his head.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.640
They must be closed.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.200
- Oh, gross!
- I have some work to do.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.080
I'll be back before the period ends.
You two stay right here.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.120
I'll go too,
so you'll have company.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.760
Thanks, sweetheart,
but you stay with Tyler.

23:12.680 --> 23:15.040
Now you won't be by yourself.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.960
Thank you.

23:18.640 --> 23:22.480
I mean it. Don't leave your seats.
Oh. In case you want a soda.

23:22.560 --> 23:26.360
- Don't get out of your seats to get it.
- We get the idea, Dad.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.440
Hey, what's that?

23:29.480 --> 23:31.360
Nothing.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
What's Daddy gotta do?

23:47.120 --> 23:48.960
Probably change more light bulbs.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.520
You said firemen don't do
that kind of stuff.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.960
Dad's not really
a fireman any more, Emily.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.680
Now a steal by Stevens.
He walks into the Chicago end.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.000
Slap shot!
He... shoots and scores!

24:01.080 --> 24:04.040
Kevin Stevens gives the Penguins
the opening goal.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.640
Get in the fast lane, Grandma.
The bingo game is ready to roll.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.760
Hey!

24:20.840 --> 24:23.160
He doesn't know whether
to cry or wind his watch.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.320
Hey!

24:25.400 --> 24:29.240
- The Penguins have scored.
- Hey!

24:29.320 --> 24:34.160
That one came off Steve Smith, the
Chicago defenseman, and finds the net.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.360
Pittsburgh goal,
his 11th in the play-offs...

24:37.440 --> 24:40.360
scored by number 25,

24:40.440 --> 24:43.120
Kevin Stevens!

24:43.200 --> 24:46.120
Face-off at center ice.
Naslund of the Penguins controls.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.000
He jumps into the Chicago end with the
Penguins leading 1-0 here in game seven.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.240
Mike, as we expected,
the hitting has been ferocious.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.120
Uh, if the smoke bothers anyone,
you just speak up.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.760
There's no reason to kill anyone else.
Nobody's a threat to you.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.960
You know, I voted for you.
I really did.

25:05.040 --> 25:08.320
It's your sincerity
and your compassion.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.400
You happen to be wrong, though. There
may be a reason to kill someone else.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.800
There's bound to be
resistance to my "objective."

25:13.840 --> 25:17.800
I assure you I won't kill
more people than it takes
to convince everyone of my sincerity.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.720
Will you make that cow
stop moaning?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.960
Just...

25:25.640 --> 25:28.320
- What's that?
- An invitation to the White House.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.680
Open it and read it.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.520
Don't, don't, don't.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.160
- Out loud.
- It's nothing but a bunch of numbers.

25:37.240 --> 25:40.640
And they wonder why
this economy's so fucked up.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.240
Those are the numbers of 13 accounts in
5 U.S. banks belonging to 3 countries...

25:44.320 --> 25:49.040
that our government
has frozen for a variety of reasons.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.760
They represent a total deposit of one
billion, seven hundred million dollars.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.120
Christ, it runs in the family.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.360
During the course of this game, all
that money is going to be released...

25:58.440 --> 26:01.160
and transferred to banks
of my choice.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.120
- That's impossible.
- At least one-third must be moved...

26:04.200 --> 26:06.840
during each of the three
periods of the game.

26:06.880 --> 26:11.000
lf, at the first period's end, deposits
are behind, one of you will die.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.640
If we're still lagging at the end of
the second period, two of you will die.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.240
And at the end of the third period
everyone in this building will die.

26:17.280 --> 26:20.000
- You have no idea of the complexity...
- I had an idea.

26:20.040 --> 26:24.200
I had this idea, and we are gonna
make it work or we're gonna die trying.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.400
You will call the President,
and on flash precedence priority,

26:28.480 --> 26:32.480
he will call the Secretary of State
and Secretary of the Treasury.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.920
Then banks will be notified
and the money will begin to move.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.800
Or it won't.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.560
And if it doesn't,
when the game ends,

26:42.600 --> 26:45.160
everyone in this box
and in this arena will die...

26:45.240 --> 26:47.080
by explosion, fire and panic.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.880
Enough bombs have been planted
in this building to stop all
the clocks in the hemisphere.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.960
- You'll die with us.
- Could be.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.920
I don't think anyone with manicured
fingernails and a $10,000 wristwatch...

26:57.000 --> 27:00.680
- is planning on blowing himself up.
- $15,000 wristwatch.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.800
I'm not sure if I like you.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.000
When I make up my mind,
you'll be the first to know.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.440
- You're out of your mind.
- Me? Ha!

27:11.560 --> 27:16.760
I'm not the one paying some
Neanderthal 40 million dollars
to skate up and down the ice.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.640
Call the White House.
You need the number?

27:23.720 --> 27:27.120
Left wing pass
down to Steve Smith.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.600
I've got every agent
converging on the arena,

27:30.720 --> 27:33.080
and we'll all get the support
we need from local P.D.

27:33.160 --> 27:37.000
The FBI won't be necessary.
He's our asset. We'll get him back.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.200
Tell the President I'll keep him fully
informed until the Vice President's out.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.280
There'll be a total
media blackout on this.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.520
We'll inform all news outlets
of how serious this is.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.720
Yes, sir. Absolutely. The place is
sealed off. No one can go in or out.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.640
And...

27:49.760 --> 27:52.080
We messed up a few times
since I've been an agent,

27:52.160 --> 27:54.600
but how the fuck did we lose
the Vice President?

28:11.280 --> 28:14.000
Right side, Weinrich fires.
Down the left side, Graham shoots!

28:17.080 --> 28:20.600
Penguins trying to get it out.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.800
The sound in this building
is absolutely deafening.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.200
Shot picked up by Dubinsky.

28:32.520 --> 28:37.200
Players are playing their guts out. It's
so loud, I can hardly hear myself think.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.760
You don't have to think, Mike.
This is hockey.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.600
The Hawks pressured now. Under 2 minutes
to go. Graham moves against Tolliver.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.240
Fires and scores! The Chicago
Blackhawks have tied this game...

28:53.360 --> 28:55.680
as Dirk Graham nailed it home,
his fourth of the play-offs.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.480
And the Penguins and Hawks
are tied at one in game seven.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.200
The Chicago goal,
his fourth of the play-offs...

29:03.240 --> 29:05.640
They haven't moved a dime.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.760
You know, I don't think
they believe you.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.840
They're gonna sacrifice
a life to test my will.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.680
I'm truly disappointed. Nobody does
anything these days because it's right.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.800
They only do it if you make them.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.560
Would you like to vote on who gets the
distinction of demonstrating my resolve?

29:21.600 --> 29:24.800
You're not giving enough time. I told
you it couldn't be done that quickly.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.160
Oh, you watch how much
they accomplish during the next period.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.800
Now, would you all agree that
the mayor's wife's been most annoying?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.320
Chicago again trying to make a move.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.720
The Hawks attacking
the Penguin territory.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.120
- An Orangeade.
- Coke or Sprite.

29:41.160 --> 29:45.280
Sprite. No, Coke.

29:45.320 --> 29:49.320
- Are you sure this time?
- One minute remaining
in the first period.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.120
- "Sprite. No, Coke. No, Sprite."
- Shut up!

29:53.240 --> 29:55.160
You're lucky Daddy's not here!

29:55.200 --> 29:58.200
- Why, is there a light bulb
that needs changing?
- You take that back!

29:58.240 --> 30:01.000
- Daddy's a fireman!
- He's too scared to be a fireman.

30:01.120 --> 30:04.280
- He is not!
- Is too.
- I hate you.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.200
Hey, Emily!
Dad said to stay here!

30:14.280 --> 30:16.120
Hey, Emily!

30:17.640 --> 30:20.480
Back in the right corner,
it'll be Steve Smith.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.920
Smith out around center.
He lost the puck.

30:23.040 --> 30:26.120
Robitaille back down
to Chicago territory.

30:28.960 --> 30:33.240
Doesn't look too good.

30:33.320 --> 30:37.080
Graham comes down the slot.
He's stopped by Tolliver.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.480
Hey, Joan, going out
to entertain the Veep?

30:39.520 --> 30:41.400
Mmm.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.160
Are you okay?

30:45.280 --> 30:47.880
He can't push it in.
He had a chance.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.880
Ohh!

31:03.520 --> 31:07.320
First period, shots on goal:
Chicago, 12;

31:07.400 --> 31:09.320
Pittsburgh, 8.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.240
Icey!

31:40.840 --> 31:43.320
Say anything
and I'll kill your mother.

31:43.400 --> 31:48.440
The official Stanley Cup album is
on sale at the Arena Concourse area.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.480
Be sure to pick up your copy now.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.120
- Where's Emily?
- She went to the bathroom.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.360
I told you two not to move.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.520
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.040
- She hit me and...
- You soaked her.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.240
Don't move.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.640
If the building is falling down
around you, you don't move!

32:26.080 --> 32:28.080
Emily!

32:46.160 --> 32:48.240
It's a young wine.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.440
Frisky. Huh.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.680
It's almost impetuous,
wouldn't you say?

32:53.760 --> 32:56.240
I can't think of any
punishment as severe...

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
as the one you deserve.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.400
They didn't listen to me
and someone died. Call the President.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.320
Tell him how much fun we're having.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.960
I'm sorry. You're not cleared.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.640
The owner just called me.
I'm Icey, the team mascot.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.960
We're here to see
the Vice President.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.880
- Who's this?
- The owner's niece.

33:30.960 --> 33:34.280
Randy, we got clearance
on a Mr. Icey?

33:38.320 --> 33:40.760
Randy?

33:40.840 --> 33:43.880
- Randy.
- Mr. Icey's a woman, jerk-off.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.280
Emily!

34:13.760 --> 34:16.960
Fuck it.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.080
You owe me a Mother's Day card.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.280
- What is this, a day-care center?
- She saw me off a guy.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.199
- Then you off her.
- I tried.

34:31.280 --> 34:35.199
Touch her, you'll lose me as a hostage,
because you'll have to shoot me.

34:35.280 --> 34:38.199
- Mr. Vice President.
- Aw, shut up. He's campaigning.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.239
- Who are you here with?
- My daddy, and he's a boss.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.440
And he's very brave
and he's not afraid.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.080
And he's gonna come looking
for me, and you'll be sorry.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.320
Oh, I'm already sorry.
What do you mean, he's a boss?

34:49.440 --> 34:51.800
He's a head fireman
and he makes sure everybody's safe...

34:51.880 --> 34:53.880
- and there's no fire.
- Who is this boss?

34:53.960 --> 34:57.440
Uh, he must be a fire marshal.
When we have special events...

34:57.520 --> 35:01.200
Yeah, yeah. Go and see if there's a
nervous father looking for his daughter.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.800
- What is your name?
- Emily.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.640
- Emily what?
- McCord.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.480
- And your father's name?
- It's McCord too.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.040
Would you like it if I filled
your little mouth with spiders?

35:18.080 --> 35:20.200
- What's his whole name?
- Darren Francis Thomas McCord.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.440
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.640
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.040
Ah!

35:33.960 --> 35:36.800
Joan, I was trying
to catch up with you and Emily.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.720
- She wasn't supposed to leave her seat.
- I'm Carla.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.040
- Joan had to go home sick.
- But you were with...

35:42.040 --> 35:44.440
my... my daughter Emily.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.760
Yeah, she was lost.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.560
So I took her up
to the owner's box.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.680
Come on.
We'll go get her.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.480
Ow!

36:40.800 --> 36:42.840
Aah!

36:42.880 --> 36:44.560
Aah!

36:45.960 --> 36:48.320
Aah!

38:30.720 --> 38:34.600
Second period action about to begin.
The Penguins and Hawks tied at one.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.880
Penguins have the face-off.
Francis deals it up to the Chicago end.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.480
Jagr will chase it down.
He pops it up.

38:40.560 --> 38:44.200
The pass is out to the Penguins.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.600
You've got to get the cops.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.600
My daughter's missing,
and someone just tried to kill me.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.160
Show me where this happened.

39:04.200 --> 39:07.240
May I help you?

39:07.280 --> 39:11.560
This is Matthew Hallmark, Secret
Service. Put the Vice President on.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.160
Hallmark?

39:14.240 --> 39:17.800
Well, I see they care enough
to send their very best.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.440
Gee, I never heard
that one before.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.760
- Say hello.
- This is Vice President Bender. I...

39:23.840 --> 39:26.280
- Now you talk to me.
- Who are you?

39:26.360 --> 39:28.200
- Is that necessary?
- Yes.

39:28.280 --> 39:31.000
I'm a disillusioned patriot with a yen
to fulfill my personal ambitions.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.760
- All right. How many are dead?
- Counting Secret Service?

39:33.800 --> 39:37.080
By the way, why do you tell everybody
you're Secret Service agents?

39:37.120 --> 39:39.720
If it's supposed to be
a secret, don't tell anyone.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.200
How many are dead?

39:42.280 --> 39:46.360
One civilian, but the room
is full of candidates.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.880
- Don't kill anyone else, you hear me?
- You were told the parameters.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.440
Full transfer of funds
by the end of this game.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.480
No attempt to storm this box;
no attempt to clear the arena.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.040
No helicopters or police vehicles
encroach on the stadium grounds.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.720
- Your demands are unrealistic.
- I'm a positive thinker, Matty.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.880
We know you've already checked on these
accounts, so the wheels are turning.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.720
Oh, by the way, don't make any transfers
to the Bently-owned banks.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.560
As shocking as it may be,
they're CIA fronts.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.880
You were with one of our agencies.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.720
You're wasting some of that
unrealistic timetable.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.840
Did he sound like he'd do it?
Kill the Vice President and everybody?

40:24.920 --> 40:27.680
It sounds like he knows way too much.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.680
Chelios, right side,
wide open to the net.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.720
Tolliver! A great save there from
right in front on Dubinsky.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.680
And back come the Pittsburgh Penguins.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.520
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.240
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.720
So, where's this seven-foot penguin?

40:45.760 --> 40:49.360
She was there.
I wanna go up to the owner's box.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.280
There's a VIP in the box,
and you don't have clearance.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.720
- Neither does my daughter.
- Who knows where she is?

40:54.800 --> 40:58.120
Let's page her over the public address.
Maybe she's just lost.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.080
Oh, I made this up?
The penguin had a gun.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.640
We'll page it too.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.320
You said her name
was Carla, didn't you?

41:07.960 --> 41:10.800
I always do things like that.

41:10.880 --> 41:14.360
- You didn't say the name, did you?
- No.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.080
Aah!

41:31.120 --> 41:34.400
- What the fuck is going on?
- Fuck you. And fuck your kid.

41:36.960 --> 41:40.240
- Where is she?
- I-I don't know.

41:40.320 --> 41:44.520
- Is she in the owner's box?
- Maybe. Maybe she went out to dinner.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.640
In a minute, that ear will come off.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.640
All right! All right!

41:50.720 --> 41:52.920
All right! We took the box.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.840
We got people everywhere.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.800
The whole joint's rigged with bombs.

41:57.880 --> 42:00.880
We could bring the whole building down.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.120
What are you, terrorists?

42:03.200 --> 42:06.280
I'm no fucking terrorist.
I'm a professional!

42:06.360 --> 42:08.640
- How do I get in the box?
- Oh, you don't.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.080
Not if you want to see that kid alive.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.800
Aah!

42:36.320 --> 42:39.600
Game's tied at one. Chicago
puts the pressure on the Penguins.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.520
Here's Shantz around the net.
He knocks it right in.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.240
Chicago has taken the lead
against the Penguins.

42:45.280 --> 42:49.080
- Jeff Shantz, the goal scorer.
- This crowd is unhappy,
but give the Hawks credit.

43:21.280 --> 43:25.120
Joe Murphy helping the play,
the Chicago center ice man.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.240
Joan.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.720
Murphy backhanded it off the right wing
boards, and ahead it goes...

43:50.800 --> 43:52.480
into Chicago ice.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.840
Cam Russell wearing number eight
in a bright red Chicago uniform.

43:55.880 --> 43:59.200
For Chicago, every step,
every rush is so important.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.800
911, emergency services.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.640
- Officer Lyons speaking.
- My name is Darren McCord.

44:06.720 --> 44:10.480
I'm calling you
from the Civic Arena. 555-1923.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.400
This is not a crank call.

44:12.480 --> 44:15.640
The Vice President is being held hostage
in the owner's box.

44:15.680 --> 44:18.480
- They've got my daughter too.
- This is Sergeant Kurtz.

44:18.560 --> 44:22.720
- Where are you calling from?
- The executive offices.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.560
Stay there for 90 seconds
and keep the line clear.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
The Hawks got a man wide open.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.800
He's a step behind the defense.
Here he comes. His shot.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.720
Diving to make the save.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.800
Yeah?

44:38.880 --> 44:40.920
McCord? Hallmark, Secret Service.
What's your situation?

44:41.000 --> 44:44.480
- Lousy. How long have you
known what's going on here?
- Assume we don't.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.680
Someone is holding the owner's box
and everybody in it, including my kid.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.960
- What else?
- Did you have agents posted
at a private elevator?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.080
- Two.
- Notify their families.

44:54.160 --> 44:57.320
- Had any contact with the aggressors?
- I killed two. Is that contact?

44:57.400 --> 45:00.600
Look, one of them told me they're going
to bring this whole building down.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.600
- What are you gonna do?
- We're evaluating the situation.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.920
There's no situation! They want money,
a lot of it. Give it to them.

45:06.960 --> 45:10.240
If you fuck around
and something happens to my kid...

45:10.320 --> 45:12.480
We're considering
every possible response.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.560
If you're not gonna pay,
I'll get my daughter.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.120
Do not try any kind of rescue.
Do you understand me?

45:17.240 --> 45:20.160
You will jeopardize the Vice President
and everyone else in the arena.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.880
Believe me, we know
what the hell we're doing.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.240
Our agents are entering the arena.

45:25.280 --> 45:28.280
You stay where you are.
We're gonna do this by the numbers.

45:57.920 --> 46:02.200
- What number was that, three?
- What I said goes. Don't do anything.

46:02.240 --> 46:06.360
They've turned this whole place
into one big bomb. Do you understand?

46:06.400 --> 46:09.240
- We have bomb squads.
- They don't do us any good out there.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.600
- I'll find the bombs myself.
- You can't do anything alone!

46:12.640 --> 46:14.520
I'm not alone.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.240
Watching them operate
doesn't give one much hope, does it?

46:26.320 --> 46:29.920
I'm comfortable with whatever strategy
they deem appropriate.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.520
Strategy? Shit.
They fucked up!

46:34.560 --> 46:36.920
Two men should have been
stationed in that kitchen,

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
one with a clean geometrical line of
fire to every square inch of the room.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.840
Every body and every thing going into
that elevator should have been searched.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.680
And no covered tray should have been
allowed up here without inspection.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.960
How long were you in the service?

46:49.040 --> 46:51.920
I still am.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.800
- This is my vacation.
- Counterfeit section.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.720
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.560
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.400
We have confirmation.
One thousand meters.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.280
One thousand meters, roger.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.600
Five hundred meters and closing.

47:57.360 --> 48:00.960
Tango Alpha,
going to start deployment.

48:00.960 --> 48:04.640
Sierra Poppa, deploying one.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.800
Deploying two.

48:08.880 --> 48:12.440
Uh, what's your rate
of deployment there?

48:14.240 --> 48:16.320
Roger.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.240
Three hundred feet.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.880
Three hundred feet.
Copy.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.800
Two hundred feet.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.560
Break off!
Break off!

48:57.280 --> 48:59.640
Man down!

49:03.320 --> 49:06.400
This is Hallmark.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.720
I said no vehicles on the grounds,
no helicopters in the air...

49:08.800 --> 49:10.640
and no agents
in the building.

49:10.720 --> 49:14.360
What part of that
did you not understand?

49:26.520 --> 49:29.560
Three cars are closing on the building
that missile came from.

49:29.600 --> 49:32.800
Ground the other choppers.
I don't want to take this guy alive.

49:43.480 --> 49:47.200
Penguins slip it back
behind the Chicago goal.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.280
He shoots and scores!

49:49.400 --> 49:52.240
Sandstrom and the Penguins
have tied it at two.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.040
Oh, scratch my back
with a hacksaw!

49:55.160 --> 49:58.520
Hey!

49:58.560 --> 50:02.320
The Pittsburgh goal,
fourth of the play-offs...

50:02.360 --> 50:07.520
scored by number 17,
Tomas Sandstrom!

50:37.280 --> 50:39.680
The cavalry's coming.

50:39.720 --> 50:43.640
Custer was in the cavalry.
Let 'em come.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.200
- Command, access acquired.
- Roger, copy.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.280
Second team going.
Now.

50:48.320 --> 50:52.160
Motorola MX 360, encryption
and frequency-hopping capability.

50:52.240 --> 50:54.720
Right out of the company store.
You talk, we listen.

50:54.840 --> 50:56.640
Four at the
east side entrance.

50:56.760 --> 51:00.720
We got a light blazer, maybe a tan
windbreaker with a black baseball cap.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.000
A dark yet tasteful windbreaker...

51:03.040 --> 51:06.680
and, uh, a Penguin jacket
and dark pants.

51:06.720 --> 51:09.880
We pay these idiots to protect you,
and they're trying to get you killed.

51:09.920 --> 51:13.520
As a taxpayer, I don't think
you're getting our money's worth.

51:13.600 --> 51:17.360
If those guys want to see a hockey game
so much, we should put them on ice.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.520
We're giving it five minutes.
If they don't report, we're moving in.

51:21.600 --> 51:25.360
That's the President's choice,
but I think it's the wrong one.

51:25.400 --> 51:28.160
- Unless I get a direct order,
I'm getting those guys out.
- Sir?

51:28.160 --> 51:31.040
- What?
- I think you oughta see this.

52:11.520 --> 52:13.400
Stay back!

52:18.880 --> 52:21.720
- Jesus Christ.
- Get 'em out of here.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.400
Penguins gun out of their
own end at the center ice.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.400
They work it down the right.
Murphy has it and he gave it away.

52:28.480 --> 52:32.480
Here's Mullen. It goes wide
off the glove of Eddie Belfour.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.800
John Cullen going
behind the Chicago net.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.160
This guy could prove
to be a pain in the ass.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.080
He has heroic tendencies.

53:11.240 --> 53:14.800
Don't get so worked up.
They'll win.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.280
We've got four minutes left
in period number two.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.920
Centered in the Chicago zone.

53:52.960 --> 53:55.040
Mullen passes to Larry Murphy.

53:55.160 --> 53:57.240
Murphy backhands it
off the right wing boards.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.680
Belfour keeps the play alive.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.720
No, don't!
Oh, don't do it!

54:02.800 --> 54:05.160
This place is ready to explode.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.360
The last seconds of play.

54:16.800 --> 54:18.520
Don't!

54:23.160 --> 54:26.720
- You just killed two
useful members of society.
- No! It's being done!

54:26.800 --> 54:30.640
- The time ticking down here.
- Maybe you'll do better
in the third period.

54:30.720 --> 54:34.360
- They're moving some.
- They're way behind.

54:34.400 --> 54:37.280
I said one-third at the end
of the first period, one-third
at the end of the second period.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.160
- Two seconds left.
- I don't see anything
even close to that.

54:40.240 --> 54:43.280
No!

54:46.640 --> 54:50.640
Second period shots on goal:
Chicago, seven; Pittsburgh...

54:50.720 --> 54:53.680
The mayor has decided not
to run for reelection.

54:53.760 --> 54:57.440
Now, for my
second selection,

54:57.440 --> 55:00.480
I... think...

55:00.560 --> 55:02.680
- Um.
- No, please!

55:02.760 --> 55:04.960
They're moving more.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.120
But it's not that much.

55:08.960 --> 55:12.120
Listen to me, goddam it!
You're getting it!

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
Kids, don't try this at home.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.560
- Yeah?
- I've got a message for the board.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.880
Maybe you haven't heard.
A guy named Bell invented the telephone.

56:35.920 --> 56:39.280
- Come on, it's been dead all day.
- Which one controls the billboard?

56:39.320 --> 56:41.200
I can't let you do that.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.120
I'm having a real bad day.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.960
You're assuming his detonators
are radio-controlled.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.080
We get someone inside with equipment
to jam all frequencies...

57:04.720 --> 57:06.840
Damn.

57:06.960 --> 57:09.760
- C-4. I hope he's wrong.
- Not likely.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.640
Arson investigator,
lots of commendations.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.480
- Problem is...
- Is what, sir?

57:15.600 --> 57:18.880
He was taken off-line.
He's a head case.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.200
Shit.

57:49.280 --> 57:52.520
Here we go, final period
of the Stanley Cup finals!

57:52.560 --> 57:55.080
The Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

57:55.120 --> 57:58.000
They'll work it to Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

58:01.280 --> 58:04.040
Sir, I have strong reservations
about you going alone.

58:04.080 --> 58:06.920
There's no way to deploy
any number of men and get close.

58:06.960 --> 58:10.760
- Nobody else is coming out dead!
- How you gonna get there?

58:10.800 --> 58:13.640
Walk. One solitary man
shouldn't trigger a deadly response.

58:13.680 --> 58:17.200
If it does, tell my ex-wife
her gravy train went off the tracks.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.680
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.160
- Don't be too quick
to pull the trigger.
- Save it. I placed that stuff.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.800
No detonator, no "ka-boom."

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.480
- Everybody's an expert.
- Bye-bye.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.840
Aaah!

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.880
Bye-bye.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.000
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.160
- Do you believe me about the explosives?
- Afraid not.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.520
You're McCord. I'm Hallmark.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.440
Have any I.D?

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.280
I didn't kill you.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.840
That's for doing your job half-assed...

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.720
and putting
my daughter's life in danger.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.640
- And the Vice President's.
- How'd you happen to come down here?

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.560
I saw these two and followed them.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.600
Part of my job is recognizing
who's out of place and who isn't.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.760
They didn't seem
interested in hockey.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.920
- How'd you kill that guy?
- Magic. I think there's more
setups like this.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.600
- You know where they are?
- I made some educated guesses.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.520
These are the points I'd pop
if I wanted to bring this place down.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.320
- You marked 15 or 20.
- The places that would cause
the most structural damage.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.680
Third period's started. We got less
than 20 minutes and we're guessing.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.080
Let's hope I know what I'm doing.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.880
Oh. Listen.
My son is here too.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.320
If I can't get back to him,
he's sitting in D-10.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.160
I'll be there.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.120
- Thanks.
- Where are the rest of your men?

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.760
From the Chicago end,
McEachern centers.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.040
Belfour made the stop.
Straka with a quick shot.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.200
Just missed the far post.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.120
- Now they're moving it.
- Yeah, but where? Check the codes.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.000
Four hundred million to
Banco de Vizcaya, Madrid.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.920
That's one of the counter banks.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.800
And 300 million
to Banco Popular, Virgin Islands.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.480
These transfers are being tracked;
you'll never get the money.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.200
Not all of it. The money
will be transferred to 12 more banks.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.400
I have arrangements with
the presidents of two.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.600
Once it's transferred, it's transferred
again and again in a matter of minutes.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.680
With each stop,
cash is siphoned and rerouted,

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.800
some converted to foreign currency,

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.480
some to negotiable instruments.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.360
Thanks to the incredibly vast
and complicated world of banking...

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.560
that our CIA uses to such advantage,

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.040
about 500 million dollars will be lost,
absorbed by the system.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.880
And the other billion,
200 million is just a diversion.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.600
I only wanted enough to
pay off my American Express.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.000
You wouldn't be so generous
with that information...

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.880
if you weren't planning
to kill everyone here.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.400
Who gets the Cup if I blow up
the building before the game is over?

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.160
Yeah?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.760
Not on the phone. You know
they've got the frequency by now.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.280
Don't go away.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.720
Taken away, and McEachern
hustling down the right side.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.840
Coming into the Chicago end. Moves in to
the net. A backhand shot, off-target.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.680
McCord's disarming your bombs.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.520
- Is he guessing?
- He's a pretty good guesser.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.440
- Is he alone?
- Yeah.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.320
- Why didn't you kill him?
- Two of your goons started
firing at us. He ran off.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.800
- It was all I could do to keep
from getting my own ass shot.
- I want him.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.680
I would've had him if you had
more control over your men.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.440
The only problem my men had is they
didn't hit what they were shooting at.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.320
Look, I was there too.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.360
Nice.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.920
I got the next best thing
to the fireman.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.760
He's got a little boy here in the arena.
I know where he's sitting.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.960
Bring him to me.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.320
I always wanted a son.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.520
Greg Smyth against Robitaille,
and zoom!

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.240
Quick shot, save made! Hawgood trying
to tee it up. Stopped by Tolliver.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.080
- Tyler?
- Yeah?

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.320
Pretty exciting game, huh?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.160
- How come you know my name?
- Your dad and I are friends.
He asked me to come get you.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.840
He and your sister got invited to sit
in the owner's box, way up there.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.720
They got big soft chairs
and plenty to eat.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.560
My dad told me to stay here,
even if the building fell down.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.440
If it did come down,
up there is where you'd wanna be.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.640
Come on.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.680
I'm gonna stay here.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.800
I'm gonna be embarrassed
going back without you.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.320
- Do you know my mom?
- No, but your dad's invited me
over for dinner tomorrow.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.240
My mom and dad don't live together.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.120
He didn't mention that.
He just said bring you upstairs.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.440
- Don't you think you should
do what you're told?
- I am.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.200
I need you to come with me.
I'm with the Secret Service.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.960
- Come with me now.
- Come on! Down in front!

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.000
- I'll scream.
- I said, I'm with the Secret Service.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:18.160
- And I'm a little kid.
- Hey, fella, I didn't pay to watch you!

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.080
Down in front!

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.240
Steve Smith finds the lane.
He'll skate ahead.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.960
Coming to the Penguin line.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.720
How many'd you get?

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.800
Four, so far.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.680
- Is that all?
- Christ, I'm just one guy.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.560
- How many did you get?
- Just one.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.480
You are all alone, aren't you?

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.400
- You must be real proud.
- I'm gonna be real rich.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.800
Now, very slowly...
I mean very slowly...

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.680
pull your hands
out of your pockets.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.800
- What are you gonna do, drown me?
- No.

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:20.160
Aaaah!

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:15.680
- Yeah?
- Hallmark's dead.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.640
- Who's this?
- Tom Castillo, Secret Service.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.520
Tom Castillo.
How you doin', Tom?

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.040
- I hope you were gentle with Hallmark.
- How many hostages,

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.439
besides the Vice President,
are still alive?

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.800
That's a personal question.
Ever been involved in an A.O.P., Tom?

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.080
I didn't call for conversation.
How many are still alive?

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.920
You'd probably think I was lying,
no matter what I told you,

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.760
so I'm gonna let you talk
to a little friend of mine.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.040
Hello?

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.080
- Hello?
- Emily.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.600
Don't let him know it's me. I'll get
you out. I'll take you home, I promise.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.440
Look around and tell me
how many people are there.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.520
Twelve.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.400
Well, now, wasn't that sweet?

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.920
She included me, Tom.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.360
Tell me what an A.O.P. is, or I'm gonna
shoot this cute little pumpkin.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.560
Listen to me. Listen good.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.600
If you touch her,
you look at her cross-eyed, you lose.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.040
How do you figure that, fireman?

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.920
Okay, here's the game
and here are the rules.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.080
You've got your hostages and your bombs,
so you can get your money.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.920
I'm gonna try to stop you,
but I don't want anyone to get hurt.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.880
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.760
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.960
That's the game,
you piece of shit.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.720
If you touch her, the game's off.
Then I'll come after you.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.920
You'll have to kill me in front of every
body in this arena. There will be panic.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.560
The Secret Service, S.W.A.T., the
fucking navy will have to come in here.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.440
Then you don't get your money.
You lose, pal.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.320
Well, that's not bad
for a civil servant.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.200
Oh, by the way,
in the Secret Service,

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.880
A.O.P. is "assault on principle."

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.680
- In this case, our Vice President.
- I don't give a shit.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.440
Ooh, now, Tom, come on. If we're
gonna play, you got to play nice.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:08.280
You run your ass off. I know where the
bombs are, so I know where you're going.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.320
Then come and get me.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.880
Would you like
a glass of wine or a cigarette?

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.640
It's customary to offer these
minor vices to someone before they die.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.080
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.600
- I'm the scariest person you've seen.
- You're the meanest.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.480
Am I, now?
How do you suppose I got that way?

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.280
Maybe when you were born
you had something wrong with your brain.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.920
Don't you know any little boys like me?

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.960
If there were any at my school,
they'd get expelled.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.240
I can assure you there are one or two.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.840
I'm gonna kill your daddy.
What do you think about that?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.640
He promised he'd take me home.
He always does what he says.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.240
So do I.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.800
We're in the third period.
The Penguins on the rush.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.040
Tamer brings it in.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.560
He puts it in!
Ron Francis!

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:26.200
Oh, buy Sam a drink
and get his dog one too!

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.640
Chicago desperate to get
back into this game.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.960
Sutter fires and scores!
Chicago does get the third goal!

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.800
I tell ya, Mike, I don't think
Tolliver looks like himself right now.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.040
We shouldn't be surprised. He had
a 104 degree temperature earlier today.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.360
He looks like he's struggling
in that goal for the Penguin.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.760
- Yo, Ref.
- He's calling for the referee.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.080
- He might wanna go to the bench.
- Tolliver is gonna head that way.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.960
- Backup for the Penguins is Ken Wregget.
- What's the matter?

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.840
I really feel like shit.
I don't think I can goal.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.440
Go to the locker room. Wregget!

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.800
- Get in there.
- Let's go, Kenny.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.280
Now in goal for Pittsburgh,
number 31, Ken Wregget.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.280
Hey, fireman, where are you?

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.280
- You don't call, you don't write.
- I'm not far away.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.800
- How many have you found?
- How many what?

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.720
I could detonate all ten right now.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.600
Go ahead. Then you lose.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.800
Nervous stomach, fireman?

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.800
He's at number seven.
Get somebody there.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.640
Charge!

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.760
Roberts cannot get it out.
Chelios in deep. A shot off the stick!

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.840
Section B. Now.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.640
Chelios guns it ahead
to Bernie Nicholls.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.200
Here he comes!
Look out!

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.640
He shoots and scores! Bernie Nicholls
carried it in, right down the slot.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.280
A heavy slap shot.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.440
An old-fashioned shoot-out here
at the Stanley Cup competition.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.960
Up the alley now,
center circle.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.360
Lines it up to the Penguins.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.760
He'll get the puck out.
He really shakes his stick.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.600
Mike, they're making some noise
down here and I'm not sure why.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.880
I don't believe this. Brad Tolliver
is actually coming back into the game!

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.240
This is a guy that once
finished a game with a broken ankle.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.600
Takes a lot of guts to come back in
at this point with Chicago leading, 4-3.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.320
They're on the verge of winning
their first Stanley Cup since 1960.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.720
Now he's just sitting on the bench.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.360
Feeling better?

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.800
Then get the fuck in there.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.000
And here he comes.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.480
Now back in goal for Pittsburgh,

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.280
number 35, Brad Tolliver,
replacing number 31, Ken Wregget.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.840
I don't know what he did, if he
just recharged his battery or what,

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.200
but this guy was really sick
and he's gonna try to finish the game.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.680
Can he can make the big saves to keep
the Penguins within striking distance?

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.600
He's got all summer to get better.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.240
There's Tolliver, with the crowd
here literally crazy on their feet.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.080
Penguins looking for a lift here
to try and get back in this game.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.160
Here we go!
Chicago will control the face-off.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.880
- They'll dump it to the Penguin end.
- Stay down there.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.400
- Oh, Christ.
- Chicago drives it back
into Pittsburgh territory.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.000
Chicago slips it back
behind the Pittsburgh goal.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.000
The Penguins try to get the puck back,
and they do just that.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.400
They scramble now
and deliver up the right side.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.320
They have to stay on offense. Tolliver
is not challenging the shooters.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.320
- He hasn't challenged much all night.
- Oh, shit.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.160
Move out!

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.040
Move out!

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.600
Goddam it, move out!

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.840
He's gonna come out.
He'll challenge.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.560
Tolliver hits his head on the ice,
and he's hurt, but play continues.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.360
The puck gets free.
The Penguins have command.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.840
The Penguins trail by only one.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.920
Tolliver hit his head on the ice
so hard his kids will be born dizzy.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.400
This is Chicago on the attack.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.120
What a save by Brad Tolliver!
That's the save of the year!

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.080
He oughta get five to ten
for robbing the Hawks on that...

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.480
to keep the Penguins within a goal.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.680
Not to mention, Paul,
that he's been sick.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.480
He didn't challenge much this game. Now
he comes up with the save of the year.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.840
No question about it,
that is his biggest save ever.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.280
- He makes a move in front of the net.
- What's he doing?

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.560
- He just slammed Dubinsky!
- Tolliver, what the fuck are you doing?

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.560
He gave him a right cross
and knocked him down.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.120
He's gonna get
a game misconduct and a fine.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.040
He's put his team shorthanded.
The Penguins now are really in the hole.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.240
Strange night for Tolliver.
I don't know what he's up to.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:40.000
Tolliver, that's
a thousand-dollar fine!

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.840
Get outta the way!

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.400
Who the hell are you?

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.320
What the hell...

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.520
Aaah!

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.600
Ysebaert will rebound.
He'll turn and shoot.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:25.880
Less than three minutes to go. He'll
have to find the puck. And he does.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.640
Face-off.
Off the puck he goes!

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:34.480
Chicago has it back again with two
minutes to go in third-period action.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:38.560
On the move. The Blackhawks
stopped by the Penguins' line.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.360
The Penguins desperately
trying to get back and tie.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.880
The Chicago Blackhawks
hold on to a 4-3 lead.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.720
Penguins have to look for a big gun
to try and topple Chicago again.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.120
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.480
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.640
Intercepted by Chicago!

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.920
Big check on
John Cullen of the Penguins.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.840
Jagr going for the net, Naslund shoots,
and he's stopped by Belfour.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.760
A minute, thirty-five to go
in the third period.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.920
That's all that remains
for Chicago to win the Stanley Cup.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.840
The Penguins need a rally
to tie the game.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.280
Penguins reach in the corner.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.680
Drop it.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.000
Oh, what a save!

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.280
Larmer drills one! Nice stop! He gave
more moves than Mae West on that one!

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:19.040
One minute remaining
in the third period.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.680
And the Penguins
trailing by a goal.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.240
Chicago still
putting pressure on.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.640
Forty seconds remaining now.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.000
Aaah!

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.960
The Penguins
need a goal desperately.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.640
Thirty seconds left. Chicago's looking
for the parade down Michigan Ave.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.800
They feel they've got
the Stanley Cup.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.000
Aaah!

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.600
Aaah!

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.520
...Chicago win the Stanley Cup.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.520
Time again ticking down.
Penguins running out of it.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.120
Penguins reaching for every
possible thing they have.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.960
Chicago takes it away. They'll drive
it to center with 14 seconds to go.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.360
The Penguins don't have much time!

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.360
The puck's run by Francis,
ahead to Robitaille.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.040
Not much time to go. Luc Robitaille...

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.720
We've got eight seconds left!

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.000
Seconds to go.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.480
Stop the press!
Stop the press!

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.400
The Penguins have tied the game.

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.720
We're going to sudden death overtime!
You would have to be here to believe it!

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.680
Lucky Luc has scored for the Penguins
with under a second to go!

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.040
This series has been incredible!

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.840
- Lucky Luc has done it again!
- Sudden death?

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.120
Sudden death.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.840
Paul, the Penguins
would not give up, despite the odds.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.240
Belfour tried everything
in his power to stop them.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.080
The Penguins have forced
sudden death overtime.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.440
The team that scores first in the
next period will win the Stanley Cup!

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.840
Pittsburgh goal,

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.000
his 14th in the play-offs,
scored by...

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.880
Life's just a shitbox
of ironies, huh?

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.960
We still got money to move.
I hope it's not mine.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.880
Everybody's got
a little more time.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.800
I'd hate to see them waste it.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.720
Wouldn't you?

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.040
Throw away the clocks, because the next
goal is going to win the Stanley Cup.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.960
That's what sudden death
is all about.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.800
Penguins control the draw,
drop it into the Chicago end.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.720
Jagr will carry it in.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.400
Both net-minders coming up tough here.
McEachern has it again!

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.320
Psst.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.040
Aah!

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.720
Aaaah!

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.440
Breaking quickly!
Got a man! Move!

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.840
Bang! I'm immortal.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.000
Aah!

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.120
Aaaah!

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.760
Jagr will carry it in,
but he's checked.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.320
Aaaah!

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.160
Holy shit!

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.560
What's that?

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.880
Daddy!

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.120
Daddy.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.880
- Come on, let's go!
- Watch it, will ya?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.760
How many did you find, fireman?

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.000
Tyler.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.560
I didn't move, Dad.
I didn't move.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600
Not even when things
blew up.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.800
I didn't move.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.960
It's over.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:21.960
You're McCord, right?
I'm Agent Saccio.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.840
Better off not moving
until this settles down.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.680
The Vice President wants very much
to meet you. He's very grateful.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.160
Daddy. Daddy.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.240
Daddy, that's the man.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.680
That's the man, Daddy.
That's him.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.080
Daddy!

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.680
Stay with him.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.640
Emily!

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.560
Daddy!

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.400
Let's go.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.600
Daddy!

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.120
Daddy!

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:55.000
No!

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.920
Aaah! Daddy!

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.600
Daddy!

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.160
I'm not gonna kill you!

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:42.000
I'd rather you spent the rest
of your life remembering you
couldn't save your little girl.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.280
Daddy!

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.120
Aah!

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.680
Aaah!

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.320
Aah!

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.040
Aaah!

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.800
Aaah!

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.840
Aaaah!

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.800
You should've seen my dad.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.800
My daddy's a fireman.
