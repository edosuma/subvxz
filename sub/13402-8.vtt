WEBVTT

00:02.730 --> 00:04.618
It's Sarah Harvey.
She's dead.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.359
(Hanna) Em saw someth/hg
0n Jenna 19 laptop

00:06.370 --> 00:07.359
that can link back to AD.

00:07.370 --> 00:09.691
[cell phone rings]

00:09.710 --> 00:11.132
The case is officially closed.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.734
- Tell _me what to do?
- You obvrously can't tell Ezra.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.605
- What good would it do?
- I'll delete the call.

00:15.610 --> 00:16.872
(Hanna)
Mrs. Grunwald.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.575
She's a psychic. A real psychic.

00:18.580 --> 00:23.415
And she seems to like us in some
disturbing creepy sort of way.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.741
- Bye, Caleb.
- Bye.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.752
Maybe we could just skip
the headache and elope.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.489
I'm callin' again
for Dr. Cochran.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.923
Its Noel Kann.

00:31.930 --> 00:34.251
Tell her I'm running
out of time and patience.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.557
Mary had a second child.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.926
So Charlotte had a biological
brother or sister.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.694
I'm Agent Lee from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.997
You were involved
with Nicole Gordon.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.331
- Correct?
- Yes, I was.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.831
We have reason to believe
that she may be alive.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.815
(Spencer) Okay, so we
know that Noel Kahn stole

00:55.820 --> 00:58.084
the Mary Drake file
from Toby's AirStream.

00:58.090 --> 01:00.809
- How's Yvonne doing?
- She's, she's okay.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.959
Toby's gonna spend
some time with her.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.225
And then right after he got that
file, he called Dr. Cochran.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.219
(Caleb) Sounds like
Jenna and Noel

01:07.230 --> 01:08.595
are on the same
path that we are.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.589
Only they're ahead of us.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.589
But who burned us out
of the storm cellar?

01:10.600 --> 01:11.589
Somebody who didn't
want us to know

01:11.600 --> 01:12.919
that Mary Drake had
a second child.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.931
- A.D.?
- Noel Kahn.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.293
You guys,
Noel's been in the middle

01:16.310 --> 01:18.062
of everything that's been
happening to us.

01:18.070 --> 01:20.868
He clearly has more A-ness
than anyone else out there.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.599
I wouldn't have put it
that way, Hanna.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.499
Hold on, All, you know Noel
better than any of us.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.216
I'm not proud to say it,
but you're probably right.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.847
I trusted him once,
but then I realized

01:30.850 --> 01:32.283
he was spying on me
for Charlotte.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.758
But you had something on him?
I mean, from years ago.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.284
Yeah, that's right.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.859
Must have been good.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.088
Do you remember that frat party

01:40.100 --> 01:41.522
I took you guys to,
freshman year?

01:41.530 --> 01:42.758
We made those fake IDs.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.694
Yeah, all the guys
were super drunk. So?

01:45.700 --> 01:48.089
Sorority girl
fell down the stairs.

01:49.870 --> 01:51.167
Oh, my God.

01:51.170 --> 01:54.003
She didn't fall.
Noel pushed her.

01:54.010 --> 01:57.776
See, no story with Noel Kahn
in it has a happy ending.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.179
What if you went to Noel now?

01:59.180 --> 02:00.477
Threatened to go
to the police or...

02:00.480 --> 02:01.640
No, it's too late.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.049
His family paid the girl
off years ago.

02:03.050 --> 02:04.176
He got away with it.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.543
Yeah, like he does
with everything.

02:05.550 --> 02:06.619
Exactly why we shouldn't be

02:06.620 --> 02:08.019
arguing whether Noel's A

02:08.020 --> 02:10.614
A.D., Uber A or whatever.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.882
God, I can't believe you guys.

02:14.230 --> 02:15.390
[sighs]

02:19.340 --> 02:20.568
- Hey.
- Don't.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.792
When are they gonna realize
that Noel Kahn

02:23.810 --> 02:24.902
is the one that we're after?

02:24.910 --> 02:26.559
They just wanna
be certain, okay?

02:26.580 --> 02:27.933
Mary and Jenna
are still out there.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.738
Oh, come on.
How much more proof do we need

02:30.750 --> 02:33.799
than the words "I see you"
being written on our car

02:33.820 --> 02:35.617
outside of the storm cellar?

02:35.620 --> 02:36.871
Those were the exact words

02:36.890 --> 02:38.710
written on Ezra's car
at Camp Mona.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.540
I know, okay? I get it.
It's just that--

02:40.560 --> 02:42.482
You don't believe me either.

02:42.490 --> 02:43.718
Look, we have to be completely

02:43.730 --> 02:45.254
positive before we do
anything rash.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.057
Well, I am.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.265
I don't know
what's gonna change your mind.

02:52.570 --> 02:53.662
Hanna.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.228
[engine rewing]

02:55.240 --> 02:56.992
Hanna, look out!

02:58.270 --> 02:59.430
[Caleb grunts]

03:05.280 --> 03:07.498
[screaming]

03:14.590 --> 03:17.081
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

03:17.090 --> 03:19.581
Swear this one you'll save

03:19.600 --> 03:24.594
Better lock it in your pocket
taking this one to the grave

03:24.600 --> 03:29.628
If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said

03:29.640 --> 03:34.577
'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of the them is dead

03:36.650 --> 03:38.675
So you're fine?

03:38.680 --> 03:40.272
- Really fine?
- I'm fine.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.043
- Really?
- Fine.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.851
So, um, how's it
going over here?

03:53.860 --> 03:56.590
Well, not that great. I mean,
I'm going over all the material

03:56.600 --> 03:58.966
that you and Spencer took
photos of from the lock box

03:58.970 --> 04:01.791
but everything
except for Mary's DNA

04:01.800 --> 04:03.199
is in some code
that I can't crack.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.532
- Yet, right?
- I'm doing my best.

04:06.540 --> 04:10.078
- Why DNA?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.672
What has Mary been up to?

04:11.680 --> 04:15.172
There's no sign of her,
at Alison's or the Lost Woods.

04:15.180 --> 04:16.477
What about Jenna?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.617
Any tapping around
we need to be worried about?

04:18.620 --> 04:20.144
No, she hasn't left her room.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.652
I guess Noel's taken a leave
while Jenna practices her flute.

04:23.660 --> 04:27.380
Hey, um, speaking of Noel,
give me your phone.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.618
- What's that?
- This is your new phone.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.325
It's 100% bug free.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.321
I have some
for the rest of you guys too.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.535
You can't be too careful with
Noel and Jenna on the prowl.

04:35.540 --> 04:38.464
Really? I hate breaking in
new phones.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.836
Well, Noel's found his way
into your dreams.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.478
That's close enough.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.238
I mean, I don't even know
why I'm surprised.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.184
I did this to myself. I deleted
that call from Ezra's phone

04:56.190 --> 04:58.226
and now it's coming back,
and it's gonna bite me--

04:58.230 --> 04:59.822
Aria, take a deep breath.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.458
It's been proven to prevent
explosions in small women.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.519
Ezra's with the authorities
rIght now.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.567
Nicole could be alive, Emily.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.733
First off, you can't root
for her not to be alive.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.605
No. No, of course not.

05:14.610 --> 05:17.875
And-and second, you deleted the
call for all the right reasons.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.475
- You were tryin' to spare Ezra.
- I lied to him, Emily.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.683
Lied to me about what?

05:32.460 --> 05:35.327
There was a call on your phone.

05:35.330 --> 05:37.457
It said that it was from Nicole,
so I picked it up

05:37.470 --> 05:40.792
and-and no one answered,
so I deleted it.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.928
- You what?
- It didn't make sense, Ezra.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.362
And I didn't wanna
get your hopes up.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.759
Okay. Okay.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.600
- Ezra.
- Well, uh, guess what?

05:49.610 --> 05:52.272
One of the trucks in the aid
convoy that Nicole was with

05:52.280 --> 05:56.046
was spotted near
a rebel compound or

05:56.050 --> 05:58.587
or something in Colombia, so...

05:58.590 --> 06:00.080
Have they found her?

06:01.660 --> 06:03.651
Well, the military's, uh,
going into the jungle

06:03.660 --> 06:05.025
in about two hours,
and they don't know

06:05.030 --> 06:06.452
what they're gonna find.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.395
I'm so sorry.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.233
Yeah, me too.

06:18.470 --> 06:21.200
Okay, um,
I think I'm gonna leave.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.900
Um, yeah, I guess I'll go too.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.844
I was just gonna shower,
and then I'm gonna head back.

06:30.850 --> 06:33.410
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

06:35.190 --> 06:39.251
Um, I'll see you.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.575
[sighs]

07:01.220 --> 07:03.518
So has Ezra heard anything else?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.340
- Has he called Aria?
- No.

07:07.590 --> 07:10.753
Aria's going crazy waiting.
Obviously, he is too.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.785
Yeah.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.052
[sighs] Well, I guess it's
a big day for all of us.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.051
What do you mean?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.867
I'm going back
to Rosewood High School today.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.532
Back to teaching my class.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.529
Today?

07:22.540 --> 07:24.667
I, I know you've talked about it

07:24.670 --> 07:26.160
but do you really think
now is the time?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.807
I mean, are you even ready?

07:27.810 --> 07:30.506
Well, the Welby social worker
and Dr. Sullivan

07:30.510 --> 07:32.546
gave me a clean bill of health.

07:32.550 --> 07:35.041
That's great, but it's been
less than two weeks

07:35.050 --> 07:36.074
since Archer Dunhil|--

07:36.080 --> 07:39.049
Stole all my money.

07:39.050 --> 07:42.281
Look, Em, I'm broke.
I have nothing.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.757
And unless Jason _
comes back from meeting

07:43.760 --> 07:46.627
with his forensic accountant
in Philadelphia

07:46.630 --> 07:50.555
with a truckload of cash,
I, I honestly have no choice.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.231
It's 20 minutes
to the first bell. I should go.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.735
- Wish me luck.
- You'll be great.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.710
Is everything okay?

08:11.720 --> 08:13.244
Yeah, I think so.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.854
- I took the liberty of...
- Oh.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.920
- How's Alison doing?
- Better than can be expected.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.955
Well, she's luclq to have
a good friend like you.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.155
Hi, I called ahead
for a few dozen pastries.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.592
My name is Hackett.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.299
- Thank you.
- Principal Hackett.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.269
- Hi. How are you?
- Emily Fields.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.135
H was just thinking about you.

08:33.140 --> 08:34.402
Really? Why?

08:34.410 --> 08:36.401
We've got a job opening
at the high school.

08:36.410 --> 08:38.344
Uh, head swim coach.

08:38.350 --> 08:39.977
You got your degree, right?

08:39.980 --> 08:43.108
Yeah, uh, one last class,
but I'm testing out.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.917
Well, then
if you're in town permanently

08:44.920 --> 08:46.410
you should think about applying.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.910
We would love to have you back.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.582
That is, unless you've already
gotten a job somewhere else.

08:50.590 --> 08:53.479
No. No, well, at The Radley

08:53.500 --> 08:56.526
but, um, thanks
for letting me know.

08:56.530 --> 08:58.464
I-I'll definitely think
about it.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.722
Splendid. Well, I gotta go.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.594
Hell hath no fury
like my teachers

09:02.600 --> 09:04.636
when I forget
"Thank God It's Danish Day."

09:04.640 --> 09:05.709
Oh.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.862
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.799
"Thank God It's Danish Day."

09:12.810 --> 09:14.607
It's pretty catchy.

09:14.620 --> 09:18.545
- Emily Fields, you surprise me.
- How?

09:18.550 --> 09:21.383
Would you really consider
staying here to take that job?

09:23.160 --> 09:25.720
I don't know.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.425
Maybe, I guess.

09:30.130 --> 09:31.927
Got it.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.227
Yeah?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.935
The Dr. Cochran
that Noel was calling

09:34.940 --> 09:36.862
I checked over a copy
of the Mary Drake file

09:36.870 --> 09:39.236
and I found a mention
of a doctor with the same name

09:39.240 --> 09:40.730
'that practices in Brookhaven.‘

09:40.740 --> 09:43.629
Spence, that file's
more than 20 years old.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.278
What are the odds of us finding
any real information now?

09:46.280 --> 09:48.544
They're better than the odds of
us getting anything accomplished

09:48.550 --> 09:51.519
if we stick around here.
Let's go.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.411
Okay.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.282
[indistinct chatter]

10:12.870 --> 10:14.906
[bell rings]

10:28.760 --> 10:30.819
[retching]

10:32.290 --> 10:35.054
So how was your first day
of school?

10:35.060 --> 10:36.288
Usual pranks.

10:37.530 --> 10:39.691
At least you've already
been teaching there.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.588
It's not like
it was your first time back.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.967
Like, deciding to take a job
out of the blue or something.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.801
Okay, how about we skip the part

10:46.810 --> 10:48.163
where I try and figure out
what's going on

10:48.180 --> 10:50.034
and you just tell me.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.648
I'm thinking about applying
for a coaching job

10:53.650 --> 10:56.847
at the high school,
and I was wondering

10:56.850 --> 10:59.489
how you'd feel about me
being there with you?

10:59.490 --> 11:01.549
I'm fine with it.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.313
- Really?
- Yeah, in fact I'd love it.

11:05.960 --> 11:10.056
Why? What? Did you want me to
say that I didn't want you to?

11:10.070 --> 11:11.662
No, no, not at all. I...

11:13.000 --> 11:16.367
I don't know. I'm-I'm not,
I'm not even sure I wanna do it.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.838
It doesn't hurt to apply.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.398
No, you're right.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.639
Five years ago,
who would have thought

11:26.650 --> 11:28.515
we'd both end up back at RHS?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.714
[cell phone chimes]

11:36.190 --> 11:37.612
It's Aria.

"Doesn't seem like the best
night to spend at Ezra's.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.694
Mind ifI bunk with you
at Lucas' loft?"

11:44.300 --> 11:46.222
[sighs]

11:46.230 --> 11:50.963
Em, what Aria did with Ezra's
phone, it's not your fault.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.369
No, I'm not so sure.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.908
Even ifI did get her
into this mess

11:56.910 --> 11:58.969
maybe there's a way
I can get her out.

12:01.150 --> 12:02.344
- Hel_lo.
- Hi.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.910
Um, we're here to see
Dr. Cochran.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.979
We're the ones
who called earlier.

12:06.990 --> 12:09.618
How can I help you?

12:09.620 --> 12:13.454
Oh, I'm...sorry, we were looking
for a Dr. Cochran

12:13.460 --> 12:14.722
who would have worked
at this address

12:14.730 --> 12:16.789
about 20 or so years ago.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.495
That would've been my father.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.058
Did he used to practice here?

12:20.070 --> 12:23.096
He did. He was an OB/GYN.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.567
He lost his license years ago.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.832
Look, I really have
to get back to work.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.671
(Spencer)
'I'm so sorry, doctor, please.‘

12:28.680 --> 12:31.274
Is there any way that we can get
in touch with your father?

12:31.280 --> 12:33.840
We-we just need to ask him
a couple of questions.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.418
Look, I don't know
where my father is.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.183
I haven't spoken
to him in years.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.629
You two seem nice enough.

12:45.630 --> 12:48.053
Are you in some kind of trouble?

12:48.060 --> 12:51.826
Well, yeah, kind of.

12:51.830 --> 12:55.436
Oh, no. Uh, sorry, no.
Not that kind of trouble.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.864
- No.
- Well, then take my advice.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.634
Wherever my father is,
it's where he belongs.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.739
Don't go looking for him.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.114
Emily, I appreciate you coming.
I really do.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.348
And I believe you when you say

13:14.360 --> 13:15.987
that it was your idea
to delete the call--

13:15.990 --> 13:17.218
Good, thank you.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.882
But that doesn't change the fact
that she still did it.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.789
- Can you blame her?
- Uh, yeah. A little.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.928
- She was scared.
- Of Nicole coming back?

13:26.940 --> 13:29.090
Of losing you.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.364
Look, Ezra, I know
what you're going through.

13:31.370 --> 13:32.632
Do you?

13:33.710 --> 13:38.374
Okay. Okay, I don't know,
but I can imagine.

13:38.380 --> 13:41.269
And possibility of Nicole
being alive

13:41.280 --> 13:43.510
it seems like
it changes everything.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.638
But don't let it
change everything.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.854
Like?

13:50.860 --> 13:51.849
Like the fact that you

13:51.860 --> 13:53.657
and Aria love each other.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.128
That you proposed to her
less than a week ago.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.868
I hear you. I really do.

14:02.870 --> 14:03.962
Um...

14:05.240 --> 14:08.266
I-I really need
to think this through.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.579

haven't had time to even...

till they reach the camp?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.960
Goodness, Hanna.

15:05.970 --> 15:09.189
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

15:16.810 --> 15:19.643
Mrs. Grunwald,
what are you doing here?

15:19.650 --> 15:21.948
Are you alone, my dear?

15:23.890 --> 15:26.313
Yeah, Aria and Emily
are out, but...

15:27.420 --> 15:29.581
I mean, are you alone?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.081
Caleb and I are...

15:37.300 --> 15:38.722
I'm sorry.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.164
I don't wanna be rude,
but what are you doing here?

15:43.370 --> 15:44.997
I had a dream.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.060
What happened in it?

15:50.380 --> 15:52.598
I've never considered

15:52.610 --> 15:55.374
the content of dreams
to be important.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.941
It's the impressions they leave
that affect me.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.415
- Impressions?
- Hm.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.650
Well, in this case

16:04.660 --> 16:07.128
the dream left me
qUIte unsettled.

16:07.130 --> 16:12.124
The sense was strong enough that
I felt compelled to come here.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.392
The sense of what?

16:14.470 --> 16:17.234
A darkness

16:17.240 --> 16:19.663
around you and Caleb.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.001
Are the two of you alright?

remember me?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.879
Yeah, of course.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.187
I'm the person whose office

16:40.200 --> 16:42.191
you had someone ransack
last night.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.828
Um, sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about--

16:44.830 --> 16:46.195
'Stop it, alright.‘

16:46.200 --> 16:48.930
You and your little friend
came to see me

16:48.940 --> 16:50.396
and I didn't give you
what you wanted

16:50.410 --> 16:51.798
so you sent someone back here

16:51.810 --> 16:54.028
to break in and find it for you.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.678
'But he didn't find it, did he?'

16:55.680 --> 16:58.240
- No.
- 'Well, guess what?‘

16:58.250 --> 17:01.742
I can't afford to have your guy
come back here again

17:01.750 --> 17:03.308
so get a pen.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.811
- A pen?
- Write down this address.

17:05.820 --> 17:08.015
Oh, yeah, okay. Okay.

- Okay.

You should feel right at home.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.795
And what's at this address?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.631

17:24.640 --> 17:28.201
At least he was the last time
the police called me about him.

17:28.210 --> 17:31.202
And here's a hint.
You want him to talk

17:31.210 --> 17:34.247
you better bring
a bottle of whisky.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.377

Now please, call off your dogs
and don't bother me again.

to hurt us.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.652
Do you know who that someone is?

18:20.660 --> 18:22.719
I think so.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.550
But the others
aren't qUIte so sure.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.526
Oh.

18:26.530 --> 18:29.237
By any chance, does that person

18:29.240 --> 18:32.209
have a connection
with this hotel?

18:32.210 --> 18:33.461
Yeah.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.868
Yeah, he's staying here.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.235
He attacked Alison,
he kidnapped me

18:37.250 --> 18:40.549
and someone just died
in this hotel.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.576
Many people died here, Hanna

Their pain

18:52.690 --> 18:55.898
radiates through these walls.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.689
Their cries of anguish

18:59.700 --> 19:02.021
still echo.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.498
Do you hear them?

19:15.720 --> 19:17.017
No.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.378
You're lucky.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.218
It's. . .deafening.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.222
In "Winter's Tale,"
we're prompted to consider

19:34.240 --> 19:36.561
what happens to someone
when those around them

19:36.570 --> 19:39.801
incorrectly conclude
that they are immoral

19:39.810 --> 19:42.370
unworthy or outright liars.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.004
So what happens
to someone's character

19:45.010 --> 19:46.443
when they're wrongfully accused?

19:47.980 --> 19:51.108
Well, Queen Hermione,
she wasn't without fault

19:51.120 --> 19:53.588
but she suffered for a sin
she didn't commit.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.808
So why would her husband,
or anyone else

19:55.820 --> 19:58.186
for that matter,
put her through that?

19:58.190 --> 20:00.681
What did Shakespeare observe
in human nature

20:00.700 --> 20:02.588
that rings true today?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.251
That some people like
to troll other people.

20:07.100 --> 20:10.661
I'd like to think that the Bard
had something deeper in mind.

20:10.670 --> 20:13.366
But that's what's going on
in the story, isn't it?

20:13.370 --> 20:15.201
No. Not really.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.838
The king's ragging on his wife
because she slept around on him.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.307
But she didn't.
That's the point.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.776
Whatever.

20:21.780 --> 20:25.216
If you're the king or the queen
and people look up to you

20:25.220 --> 20:28.041
'you can say or do
whatever you want'

20:28.060 --> 20:30.881
and get away with it.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.825
Until your lies catch up to you.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.855
Yeah, well, you'd know.

that you are in danger

that you already know that.

is that the source

I'm fine. Yeah, I'm doing great.
Thanks. I'm glad to be back.

I'm so sorry that the students
put you through that.

It amazes me how cruel
teenagers can be sometimes.

extremely unsettling.

all here. What's the emergency?

24:03.240 --> 24:05.731
I had a nightmare that
Caleb was run over by a car.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.968
But he's okay.

24:06.970 --> 24:09.609
And then Grunwald showed up
and told me he's not okay

24:09.610 --> 24:12.875
and then Noel Kahn showed up and
made Grunwald's head explode.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.348
To be fair, that does sound
like an emergency.

24:15.350 --> 24:19.184
Okay, can you go over
that again more slowly?

That Noel Kahn is A.D.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.619
[sighs] You guys, I told
you last night.

24:27.630 --> 24:28.654
He stole
Mary Drake's file

24:28.660 --> 24:30.628
he hurt Yvonne,
he called Dr. Cochran--

24:30.630 --> 24:33.269
Wait, we weren't even together
last night.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.864
No, we were in my dream.
Catch up.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.861
You guys, he burned us out
of the storm cellar

24:37.870 --> 24:39.030
and he wrote on that window.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.462
He probably killed Sara

24:40.480 --> 24:42.232
and we know he's bad
because way back when

24:42.240 --> 24:44.105
he pushed that sorority girl
down the stairs.

24:44.110 --> 24:46.374
Hanna, what about
Sara telling me

24:47.850 --> 24:50.478
I mean, she and Jenna
were working with Noel.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.446
To find Charlotte's killer.

24:52.450 --> 24:55.044
And that still leaves room
for Noel Kahn to be A.D.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.584
And what about the storm cellar?

24:56.590 --> 24:59.923
He's the only one
who'd write "I see you."

24:59.930 --> 25:01.124
- Maybe.
- No, you guys--

25:01.130 --> 25:02.597
(Emily)
'What about Caleb?‘

25:02.600 --> 25:04.295
How's he doing on breaking
the code in the files?

25:04.300 --> 25:06.894
Not good. But what does
that matter anyways?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.219
You guys are never gonna realize

25:08.240 --> 25:10.037
that Noel is the one
behind everything.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.098
Never say never.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.566
- Oh, thanks, Pam.
- Hey.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.162
What else is there to look into?

25:14.180 --> 25:16.933
Nothing. We're at a dead end.

25:16.940 --> 25:19.773
No. Not exactly.

25:19.780 --> 25:22.374
Aria and I have a doctor's
appomtment to go to.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.213
[knocks]

25:33.260 --> 25:34.579
Dr. Cochran?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.497
What's it to you?

25:37.500 --> 25:39.695
Uh, we were hoping
that we could ask you

25:39.700 --> 25:42.225
a few questions
about your time at Radley...

25:44.140 --> 25:46.665
...and a patient
named Mary Drake.

25:56.950 --> 25:58.178
I don't often get a visit

25:58.190 --> 26:01.318
from such a pretty
couple of girls.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.159
I'm shocked.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.650
I mean, uh...

26:06.660 --> 26:08.127
[clears throat]

26:08.130 --> 26:09.654
...every couple of months maybe

26:09.660 --> 26:11.753
if I save enough
from social security

26:11.770 --> 26:14.193
call one of _those
escort serwces--

26:14.200 --> 26:16.168
Hey.

26:16.170 --> 26:18.764
Curb the perv
or the bottle walks.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.568
[clears throat]

26:22.580 --> 26:23.774
[sighs]

26:26.750 --> 26:30.413
It's been a long time since
I thought about Mary Drake.

26:30.420 --> 26:33.241
She was a pretty one.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.889
What else can you
tell us about her?

26:35.890 --> 26:38.950
She |acke_d common sense
and discrimination.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.258
That seems pretty sure.

26:41.260 --> 26:42.522
How so?

26:46.170 --> 26:49.059
Back in the day,
I was the on-call doctor

26:49.070 --> 26:51.630
at Radley, the, uh, sanitarium

26:51.640 --> 26:54.336
not the wine and cheese bar
that they turned it into.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.935
[chuckles]
Let me tell you.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.669
It kept me pretty busy.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.172
Patients weren't treated
very well

27:04.190 --> 27:06.010
and that created...

27:07.360 --> 27:09.385
...problems.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.352
My job was to make
the problems go away.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.999
Problems like babies.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.195
Babies that were born

27:20.200 --> 27:23.590
and that someone wanted
to not be born.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.038
So, Mary...

27:27.040 --> 27:30.635
Oh, yeah, I dealt
with two of her babies.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.709
First one
was a C-section, right?

27:35.080 --> 27:36.377
A boy.

27:37.590 --> 27:40.548
I gave him
to Mary's sister, Jessica.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.779
- Charlotte.
- 'What's that?‘

27:45.790 --> 27:48.679
You want me to tell
the story or not?

27:48.700 --> 27:49.758
Okay.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.622
Several years later

27:55.640 --> 27:59.406
damned if Mary didn't get
into trouble again.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.435
Tbat baby was a fighter.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.579
Underweight but tenacious.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.639
I don't remember
if it was a boy or a girl.

28:09.150 --> 28:11.675
As was the custom tben

28:11.690 --> 28:13.510
it was put
into temporary custody

28:13.520 --> 28:15.841
of County Pam/7y Services.

28:17.930 --> 28:21.923
So what happened to the child
after that?

28:23.230 --> 28:26.893
Not my problem.
At least it wasn't then.

28:26.900 --> 28:27.969
Meaning?

28:31.470 --> 28:33.461
Society changed.

28:33.470 --> 28:36.234
Rules happened.

28:36.240 --> 28:41.007
Eventually, my ability to solve
problems became a liability

28:41.020 --> 28:43.545
and Radley let me go.

28:43.550 --> 28:46.519
Soon after that,
I lost my license.

28:47.890 --> 28:49.517
And Mary Drake?

28:50.620 --> 28:53.589
Haven't _heard her name
Since then

28:53.590 --> 28:55.148
till you showed up.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.692
Keep buying me whisky and

28:58.700 --> 29:01.419
'and I'll come up with something
else to talk about.‘

29:02.440 --> 29:04.067
Thank you.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.068
Hey.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.570
If you see my daughter again

29:12.710 --> 29:14.746
tell her something for me,
will you?

29:16.150 --> 29:17.469
Sure.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.219
Tell her that she can run
from me

29:19.220 --> 29:21.381
and our history all she wants.

29:21.390 --> 29:25.486
She can even pretend she's
someone completely different.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.651
But in the end

29:27.660 --> 29:31.221
she's gonna want that family
more than anything.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.460
'You can't deny human nature.‘

29:35.070 --> 29:37.595
You always return to family
in the end.

29:50.920 --> 29:55.016
Well, two days in a row.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

29:55.020 --> 29:58.251
I, uh, thought I'd apply
for the coaching position.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.352
What a coincidence.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.520
I was just, uh, interviewing

30:00.530 --> 30:01.781
another candidate.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.189
Actually, I believe
you two were classmates.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.026
Paige.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.941
Thank you.

30:22.950 --> 30:26.943
So were you surprised
to see me at school today?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.838
Yeah. A little.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.253
[chuckles]
A lot.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.852
Good surprised or bad surprised?

30:36.860 --> 30:38.919
Good. Yeah.

30:38.930 --> 30:42.627
How long has it been? Two years?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.596
Nearly three.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.566
When we were living together
at Stanford

30:46.570 --> 30:48.834
that little place
in College Terrace.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.573
It's where my dad died.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.975
It was a tough time.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.946
I was a mess.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.838
That's all I could think about.

31:04.890 --> 31:06.721
I was the reason we broke up.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.891
Hey, as good as things were
between us when they were right

31:12.900 --> 31:14.891
there's no guarantee
it would have lasted.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.960
Something else could've just
as easily come up.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.234
Yeah? Like what?

31:25.310 --> 31:26.902
Come on, I just took the hit

31:26.910 --> 31:29.640
for a whole
relationship crashing.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.140
I had my own rough patch.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.744
I was pretty focused
on making it to the Olympics.

31:35.090 --> 31:36.250
I remember.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.888
Well, then I had
a little car accident.

31:38.890 --> 31:41.029
Tore up my knee pretty badly.

31:41.030 --> 31:44.625
It heeled maybe 90%
back to where it was.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.621
That last 10%

31:46.630 --> 31:48.598
that was gonna be the Olympics.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.758
Now it's gone for good.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.879
I'm so sorry.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.169
Well, we both ran
into some bumps in the road.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.204
Me, literally.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.745
But here we are
better than ever.

32:08.290 --> 32:11.555
So why are you bothering
with Rosewood High?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.585
I mean, I'm sure
there's plenty of D1 colleges

32:13.590 --> 32:15.148
that would love to have you
on their staff.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.855
Yeah, I have a couple
applications in

32:16.860 --> 32:19.420
but when this job came up,
I figured what the hell?

32:19.430 --> 32:21.125
Yeah. Me, me too.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.823
[chuckles]

32:22.840 --> 32:25.297
- May the best woman win.
- Yeah.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.900
Cheers.

32:27.910 --> 32:30.299
I think we're gonna
need more wine.

32:30.310 --> 32:31.379
I agree.

32:50.430 --> 32:53.627
[dramatic music]

33:50.190 --> 33:51.259

God, it's incredible. The news.

34:49.850 --> 34:53.479
Yeah. It's kind of killing me
not knowing.

34:53.490 --> 34:54.809
You should go.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.886
In fact...

35:03.860 --> 35:05.999
...I got you a ticket.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.093
The flight leaves
tomorrow morning.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.829
I'll take you to the airport.

35:14.170 --> 35:15.239
You...

35:17.950 --> 35:20.202
You didn't have to do this.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.098
Yeah. I did.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.543
I've cashed in our tickets
to Italy.

35:28.990 --> 35:30.059
Ha.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.189
I, uh...

35:37.600 --> 35:39.898
I don't know what to say.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.788
Well, hopefully...

35:43.200 --> 35:45.464
...once you get there,
you will.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.137
Do you think Noel wrote it?

35:52.350 --> 35:54.671
I don't know
what to think anymore.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.874
Well, whoever AD. is

35:55.880 --> 35:58.314
they're still one step
ahead of us.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.585
Uh, not necessarily.
You got to the doctors first.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.410
Yeah, and I'll let you know
how helpful that was

36:03.420 --> 36:06.548
after I look into every county
childcare employee from the 905.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.619
(Emily) Well, maybe it's
time we go to the police

36:08.630 --> 36:09.892
and just say it's Noel.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.299
(Alison)
'And Toby hasn't left yet'

(Alison) A.D. fries us.
That's what happens.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.139
(Spencer)
Exactly.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.779
No, no, no, no, no!

36:24.780 --> 36:27.544
Please, don't do it!
Please don't!

36:27.550 --> 36:29.006
[screams]

36:31.690 --> 36:33.009
Hanna?

36:38.130 --> 36:39.279
[sighs]

36:42.600 --> 36:44.556
The deal's on.

36:44.570 --> 36:48.495
I get you the money,
you give me the keys.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.263
Tonight.

36:50.270 --> 36:52.568
And then you forget
you ever heard from me.

36:52.570 --> 36:57.906
My name, the location,
this number, all of it.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.370
Do you understand?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.517
Do you understand?

37:06.190 --> 37:07.589
Good.

37:07.590 --> 37:09.546
The less you know about this,
the better.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.129
[knocks]

37:23.600 --> 37:25.363
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.304
Um, I'm just stopping by
to tell you that I'm gonna be

37:27.310 --> 37:29.062
off the grid
for a couple of days.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.604
Why? What's going on?

37:30.610 --> 37:32.134
I'm going to New York.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.879
I have to do some legwork
for the design business

37:33.880 --> 37:35.347
Lucas and I are building.

37:35.350 --> 37:38.478
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No. Thanks.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.050
I mean, it's no trouble. This
room's getting kind of old--

37:41.050 --> 37:43.951
- Caleb, I'll be fine.
- Okay.

37:46.030 --> 37:49.056
Um, where you gonna stay?

37:49.060 --> 37:50.925
I don't know yet.

37:50.930 --> 37:53.626
Anyways, uh, I gotta go.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.461
Well, have a safe trip, I guess.

38:11.690 --> 38:16.548
I waited so long

38:16.560 --> 38:21.918
For something sweet
like this

38:21.930 --> 38:26.424
It's where I belong...

38:28.000 --> 38:29.865
(woman on PA system) 'Please
do not leave your baggage'

38:29.870 --> 38:32.293

'All items
will be confiscated...‘

38:42.950 --> 38:44.212
Go.

38:48.120 --> 38:52.819
Nothing that could
faze me now

38:52.830 --> 38:58.553
I am caught up
in a daydream

38:58.570 --> 39:03.121
Nothing that could
wake me now

39:03.140 --> 39:07.099
I am not gonna go on

39:08.410 --> 39:13.074
I am not gonna go on

39:24.830 --> 39:28.288
Baby it's gone...

39:29.360 --> 39:31.453
So did you learn anything else
about the job?

39:33.330 --> 39:35.161
[speaking indistinctly]

39:35.170 --> 39:39.061
What could go wrong?

39:40.370 --> 39:45.307
My heart is safe with you

39:45.310 --> 39:50.179
My heart is safe with you

39:50.180 --> 39:54.048
I am not gonna go on

39:55.360 --> 39:59.808
I am not gonna go on

40:31.990 --> 40:37.553
I am living in a daydream

40:37.560 --> 40:40.529
Nothing that could
faze me now

40:40.530 --> 40:42.566
Nothing that could
faze me

40:42.570 --> 40:47.837
I am caught up in a daydream

40:47.840 --> 40:50.809
Nothing that could
wake me now

40:50.810 --> 40:52.869
Nothing that could
wake me

40:52.880 --> 40:56.543
I am not gonna go on

40:57.880 --> 41:02.283
I am not gonna go on

41:03.220 --> 41:07.156
I am not gonna go on

41:08.360 --> 41:13.195
I am not gonna go on

42:03.680 --> 42:06.672
