00:01.922 --> 00:04.120
<i>That happygolucky looking kid is me.</i>

00:04.122 --> 00:07.254
<i>I was the smartest person
I had ever met,</i>

00:07.256 --> 00:10.121
<i>and I was convinced I would
grow up to be an astronaut</i>

00:10.123 --> 00:12.988
<i>and the first man on Saturn.</i>

00:12.990 --> 00:15.754
<i>This is me the summer
after my first year in college.</i>

00:15.756 --> 00:18.055
<i>I was on my first car, third girlfriend,</i>

00:18.057 --> 00:20.889
<i>and second fake ID.
I had come to the conclusion</i>

00:20.891 --> 00:23.222
<i>that space travel
probably wasn't in my future</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:26.989
<i>and that psychology
was for losers and weaklings.</i>

00:26.991 --> 00:29.256
<i>You can figure out what this is.</i>

00:29.258 --> 00:32.423
<i>The point being we move through
our lives shedding skins,</i>

00:32.424 --> 00:35.623
<i>kissing older versions
of ourselves goodbye</i>

00:35.625 --> 00:37.690
<i>and new ones hello.</i>

00:41.225 --> 00:42.557
Bull?

00:42.559 --> 00:44.590
Mind if I join you for your 9:00?

00:44.592 --> 00:46.158
What 9:00?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.657
Wh... That bigdeal attorney
from upstate

00:47.659 --> 00:50.091
that you told me to fit into
your schedule this morning.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.391
What are you talking about?

00:51.393 --> 00:52.625
Were you drinking last night?

00:52.627 --> 00:54.324
Was it a day that ends in "Y"?

00:54.326 --> 00:55.858
You don't remember me calling you.

00:55.860 --> 00:57.324
Calling me what?

00:57.853 --> 00:59.259
I smell a setup.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.526
Do you want me to walk in first?

01:02.528 --> 01:04.045
I'd love that.

01:06.661 --> 01:08.893
Mr. Burnam?

01:08.895 --> 01:10.626
So sorry to have kept you waiting.

01:10.628 --> 01:12.626
Dr. Bull just arrived.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.727
Mr. Burnam?

01:17.729 --> 01:20.527
Dr. Bull. Thank you so much
for seeing me.

01:20.529 --> 01:24.161
You're a big deal attorney?

01:25.063 --> 01:27.927
II... am an attorney.

01:28.929 --> 01:30.695
How old are you?

01:30.697 --> 01:33.228
24. 25 in March.

01:33.230 --> 01:34.961
I get this all the time.

01:34.963 --> 01:36.256
Okay.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.095
I'm gonna walk around my desk here

01:39.097 --> 01:40.729
and put myself in that chair and hope

01:40.731 --> 01:43.462
that in the time it takes me
to walk from here to there,

01:43.464 --> 01:45.929
I start to remember who you are
and why you're here.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.499 --> 02:01.564
I got nothing.

02:01.566 --> 02:03.564
You know, now that I think about it,

02:03.566 --> 02:06.101
maybe I never did call you
about this meeting.

02:06.103 --> 02:08.431
Okay. Somebody want to tell me
what's going on here?

02:08.433 --> 02:09.864
Well, don't be angry with Zack.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.698
He really is a lawyer,
and he really has been

02:11.700 --> 02:13.131
trying to reach you for several weeks.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.432
I just knew that
when you heard his story

02:15.434 --> 02:16.532
you'd want to meet him.

02:16.534 --> 02:17.665
Because?

02:17.667 --> 02:19.865
Because I, I have a case

02:19.867 --> 02:22.799
that could really benefit
from your involvement.

02:23.801 --> 02:25.666
Is that the line
that's supposed to hook me?

02:26.834 --> 02:28.099
Where are you from?

02:28.101 --> 02:30.199
Danville. It'sit's a little town

02:30.201 --> 02:32.033
about 40 miles north of here.

02:32.035 --> 02:33.566
40 whole miles.

02:33.568 --> 02:36.733
I am incredibly impressed and flattered.

02:36.735 --> 02:38.801
You have one more chance
to say something, anything,

02:38.803 --> 02:40.767
that will make me want to talk to you

02:40.769 --> 02:42.667
more than to check my emails.

02:42.669 --> 02:44.801
It's a toxic tort case.

02:44.803 --> 02:47.268
Okay. That's pretty heady stuff

02:47.270 --> 02:49.134
for a young attorney.
Somebody was exposed

02:49.136 --> 02:50.967
to chemicals that did them harm?

02:50.969 --> 02:52.468
Yeah. My mom.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.102
And five other people.

02:54.104 --> 02:55.680
Your mom?

02:56.704 --> 02:59.055
That's a lot of responsibility.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.202
You with a big firm?

03:01.204 --> 03:04.803
No, it's kind of just me, myself and I.

03:04.805 --> 03:07.536
AActually, it wasit was my
mom's idea to reach out to you.

03:08.014 --> 03:10.703
I don't understand.
Is your mom an attorney?

03:10.705 --> 03:12.503
My mom's Allison Burnam.

03:13.181 --> 03:14.136
But when you knew her

03:14.138 --> 03:16.537
she was Allison Campbell.

03:18.439 --> 03:20.204
Allison Campbell?

03:23.106 --> 03:24.620
Ally Campbell.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.705
Day in, day out, I do mostly
DUls, small claim cases,

03:28.707 --> 03:31.105
personal injury... that sort of thing.

03:31.107 --> 03:33.183
But when my mom got sick...

03:33.673 --> 03:36.205
Ilt took us a while to realize
she wasn't the only one.

03:36.207 --> 03:39.338
And do you have a theory
about why this is happening?

03:39.340 --> 03:40.772
The biggest employer
in our town is a company

03:40.774 --> 03:42.639
called Warwick Furniture Manufacturing.

03:42.641 --> 03:44.273
All my clients are near the factory,

03:44.275 --> 03:46.306
and they've all got something wrong.

03:46.308 --> 03:47.772
Thyroid disease, cancer,

03:47.774 --> 03:49.972
heart problems, bladder issues.

03:49.974 --> 03:51.506
Doesn't the fact that different
have different maladies

03:51.508 --> 03:53.740
make it difficult to prove causation?

03:53.742 --> 03:55.707
Well, I have an expert who will
explain it all stems from

03:55.709 --> 03:56.940
a chemical Warwick uses
as a flame retardant

03:56.942 --> 03:59.693
on their furniture. Trichloroethylene.

03:59.695 --> 04:00.841
The company's gonna have

04:00.843 --> 04:03.841
their own expert. And their job
is gonna be to shoot down

04:03.843 --> 04:06.340
whatever theories
your expert tries to float.

04:06.342 --> 04:08.852
I know this is gonna
be an uphill battle.

04:09.377 --> 04:10.936
That's why I'm here.

04:11.544 --> 04:13.308
Ally Campbell.

04:13.310 --> 04:16.241
She was my first real girlfriend.

04:16.243 --> 04:17.709
We went out senior year.

04:17.711 --> 04:19.541
Took her to the prom.

04:19.543 --> 04:21.476
She could throw better than I could,

04:21.478 --> 04:23.309
but I could rap better than she could.

04:23.311 --> 04:24.876
Both highly important skill sets

04:24.878 --> 04:27.209
in the adult world
we were about to enter.

04:27.211 --> 04:29.277
We were quite the couple.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.609
I feel terrible about your mother,

04:32.611 --> 04:36.077
and I wish there was something
I could do to help, but,

04:36.079 --> 04:37.844
you don't even have a settlement offer.

04:37.846 --> 04:38.911
Actually, I do.

04:38.913 --> 04:40.144
So then what's the problem?

04:40.146 --> 04:41.677
My clients won't accept.

04:41.679 --> 04:43.111
And it's not because they're greedy.

04:43.113 --> 04:45.144
It's just not a very good offer.

04:45.146 --> 04:47.812
They want to get enough at least
to cover their medical expenses.

04:47.814 --> 04:50.144
They also want the company
to install water extension lines

04:50.146 --> 04:51.912
to bypass the contaminated wells.

04:51.914 --> 04:53.745
Seems like a pretty reasonable ask.

04:53.747 --> 04:55.179
Who's representing the company?

04:55.181 --> 04:57.546
Bartlett & Dunn.
It's a local firm, but they...

04:57.548 --> 04:58.845
Yeah, we've heard of 'em.

04:58.847 --> 05:00.446
They're good. And big.

05:00.448 --> 05:01.813
And if you go to trial...

05:01.815 --> 05:03.913
I'll get beaten badly.

05:03.915 --> 05:05.779
Which is another reason I'm here.

05:05.781 --> 05:07.313
A man with a plan.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.580
40 miles?

05:10.582 --> 05:13.213
Well, maybe I'll run up
to Danville with you,

05:13.215 --> 05:14.480
see what's what.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.147
Say hi to your mom.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.980
I'm not sure I can
be of much help, but...

05:18.982 --> 05:20.381
Can you rearrange my day?

05:20.383 --> 05:21.581
Already did.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.481
And arrange for a car to bring me back

05:24.483 --> 05:26.448
into the city around 7:30 tonight?

05:26.450 --> 05:27.848
Already did.

05:41.332 --> 05:43.063
So your mom knows I'm coming?

05:43.065 --> 05:44.796
Not really.

05:44.798 --> 05:46.963
I couldn't be sure you'd
say yes and land I didn't

05:46.965 --> 05:48.597
want to make a promise I couldn't keep.

05:48.599 --> 05:49.630
Aha.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.064
What about your dad...
does he know about me?

05:52.066 --> 05:53.297
He know you're talking to me?

05:53.299 --> 05:55.064
Dad died when I was 12.

05:55.066 --> 05:56.397
He worked for Warwick.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.030
Regional Sales Manger.

05:58.032 --> 05:59.798
He was driving up to Buffalo one night,

05:59.800 --> 06:01.998
hit some ice, and...

06:03.861 --> 06:05.193
Well...

06:05.195 --> 06:06.792
I'm sorry.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.959
Long time ago.

06:10.332 --> 06:13.098
What I'm hoping to do

06:13.100 --> 06:15.165
is maybe review the settlement
with you and your mother

06:15.167 --> 06:17.432
and then try and broker
a meeting with the other side,

06:17.434 --> 06:19.056
see if we can get 'em to sweeten it.

06:19.058 --> 06:20.737
Anything to avoid court.

06:20.738 --> 06:22.235
Yeah.

06:22.237 --> 06:23.736
That sounds good.

06:24.322 --> 06:26.369
It mamake... it makes makes sense.

06:27.904 --> 06:29.203
Although there was a part of me

06:29.205 --> 06:31.236
that was really looking
forward to the trial.

06:31.238 --> 06:33.336
You like court?
You spend a lot of time there?

06:33.865 --> 06:36.236
Um, this would actually
be my first time.

06:37.074 --> 06:38.536
In court?

06:40.106 --> 06:41.371
But that's okay.

06:41.373 --> 06:43.571
When it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.971
Hey, Mom?

06:47.973 --> 06:49.574
I'm home.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.005
Also, I found this nice
stranger hitchhiking

06:52.007 --> 06:53.838
just before the Tappan Zee Bridge.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.575
Can I keep him?

06:57.554 --> 06:58.991
She, may be resting.

06:59.407 --> 07:00.826
Let me go look.

07:10.541 --> 07:14.073
How weird is this?

07:15.075 --> 07:17.007
You hunt me down
to tell me you've decided

07:17.009 --> 07:19.615
- not to go away to college after all?
- Boy. Okay.

07:19.617 --> 07:21.340
- Time to go.
- No, no, no.

07:21.342 --> 07:24.440
Get over here and give me a serious hug.

07:26.276 --> 07:27.974
Hey.

07:27.976 --> 07:29.441
I won't break.

07:37.944 --> 07:39.576
Hey.

07:39.578 --> 07:41.242
We're still a pretty good fit.

07:41.746 --> 07:44.509
Your son is standing right next to us.

07:44.511 --> 07:46.376
Please. I've peeked at his computer.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.709
He's seen lots worse

07:47.711 --> 07:49.288
than this.

07:50.045 --> 07:52.577
Figures I'd have to get deathly ill

07:52.579 --> 07:54.276
to see you again.

07:54.747 --> 07:56.664
I'm so, so, sorry.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.111
Well, the good news is
you got a great kid there.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.543
I know.

08:03.079 --> 08:04.777
Tell me about you.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.498
Kidney cancer.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.207
Not a lot to tell.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.112
On the plus side,

08:15.114 --> 08:17.545
haven't been this skinny
since you last saw me.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.979
On the minus side...

08:20.374 --> 08:21.979
this is not the life

08:21.981 --> 08:24.013
I planned for myself.

08:25.681 --> 08:27.647
At 45, it's not the ending

08:27.649 --> 08:30.213
I imagined for myself.

08:30.875 --> 08:34.546
I'm taking targeted medication,
and I'm doing immunotherapy.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.014
And for a couple of hours,
I'll feel great.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.847
And then, all of a sudden,
trying to get out of a chair,

08:39.849 --> 08:43.948
or walking across the room
will require more energy

08:43.950 --> 08:45.668
than I can muster.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.348
But I'ml'm alive,

08:49.350 --> 08:52.081
so, beats the alternative, right?

08:53.544 --> 08:54.715
How can I help?

08:55.544 --> 08:57.315
Honestly?

08:57.317 --> 08:59.849
I need you to talk to the others.

08:59.851 --> 09:04.294
This case, thisthis disease...

09:05.218 --> 09:07.017
is bankrupting us.

09:07.962 --> 09:10.183
I lose the house next month.

09:10.185 --> 09:13.450
Zack has emptied his savings.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.317
I need you to convince them.

09:16.319 --> 09:19.584
Just get them to accept an offer.

09:20.587 --> 09:22.255
Please.

09:22.653 --> 09:25.291
- We already talked about this.
- It's absolutely not what we're...

09:35.287 --> 09:38.045
Everyone just stop. Now,
I know you're upset.

09:38.047 --> 09:39.085
Upset?

09:39.087 --> 09:40.853
II have cancer, Dr. Bull.

09:40.855 --> 09:42.753
At the very least, I'm owed an apology

09:42.755 --> 09:44.986
for what they've done to me. I hear you.

09:44.988 --> 09:46.819
And I agree.

09:46.821 --> 09:48.587
But that's never gonna happen.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.387
Let me be clear.

09:50.389 --> 09:54.987
In a civil case, the only good
that can come is financial.

09:54.989 --> 09:57.021
No one is gonna say they're sorry.

09:57.023 --> 09:59.488
No one from Warwick
Furniture Manufacturing

09:59.490 --> 10:01.388
is going to jail.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.755
And no one can take away your cancer.

10:03.757 --> 10:06.287
All you can hope to win is money.

10:06.842 --> 10:08.425
And that's what's on the table.

10:09.092 --> 10:10.588
It's just not right.

10:10.590 --> 10:12.788
You brought this guy from New
York City to tell us that,

10:12.790 --> 10:14.389
Doesn't it matter

10:14.391 --> 10:16.109
that what they're
offering us is ridiculous?

10:19.891 --> 10:21.689
Ally?

10:26.225 --> 10:27.423
Ooh.

10:28.558 --> 10:31.219
Here. Here.

10:31.613 --> 10:33.111
There.

10:44.559 --> 10:46.492
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

10:46.494 --> 10:48.858
I'm okay. Zack, sweetie,
I need my pills.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.492
You know the ones I mean,
in... in my bathroom?

10:54.194 --> 10:56.525
Well, I don't think
we changed any minds down there.

10:56.527 --> 10:59.859
Not even with the encore
from <i> An Officer and a Gentleman.</i>

10:59.861 --> 11:01.992
Actually, you changed mine.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.860
I think we should go to trial,

11:03.862 --> 11:05.926
and I think
we should squeeze those bastards

11:05.928 --> 11:07.526
because of what they did to you,

11:07.528 --> 11:08.807
squeeze 'em for everything they've got.

11:08.809 --> 11:10.055
We?

11:10.629 --> 11:12.993
If you'll have me, Counselor.

11:12.995 --> 11:15.994
I'm gonna send that car
downstairs back into the city,

11:15.996 --> 11:18.427
get my clothes and my laptop.

11:18.429 --> 11:20.388
Maybe you can point me
to a hotel that's near by?

11:20.390 --> 11:23.194
There's a room for you
right down the hall.

11:23.196 --> 11:24.595
But Jason...

11:24.597 --> 11:26.094
Zack, why don't you go downstairs

11:26.096 --> 11:28.962
and tell your clients
we're going to court?

11:31.797 --> 11:33.628
Jason?

11:33.630 --> 11:36.396
You haven't seen me in 25 years.

11:36.891 --> 11:40.063
I really never expected
you to drop everything

11:40.065 --> 11:42.663
and make my problems your problems.

11:42.665 --> 11:44.763
Problems? You have problems?

11:44.765 --> 11:46.263
You think spontaneously bleeding

11:46.265 --> 11:48.597
from a facial orifice is a problem?

11:49.142 --> 11:52.197
Where I come from, that's
the ultimate party trick, lady.

11:52.199 --> 11:53.930
It is lady, isn't it?

11:53.932 --> 11:55.497
Now,

11:55.499 --> 11:58.331
I am gonna go downstairs and try
and talk a little more sense

11:58.333 --> 12:00.498
into your happy band of coplaintiffs,

12:00.500 --> 12:02.865
make some phone calls,
and then I'm gonna hit the bed

12:02.867 --> 12:06.065
in that room you offered me,
and I mean hit it hard.

12:06.067 --> 12:07.698
And I want to be really clear.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.332
If you try and sneak in
in the middle of the night

12:10.334 --> 12:14.432
and pull any funny stuff,
all bets are off, okay?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.565
I'm just not that kind of boy.

12:19.335 --> 12:21.578
Now, see, that's what I'm talking about.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.333
You got to work on your impulse control.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.198
- So what now?
- So, today I'm hoping

12:34.200 --> 12:36.817
Zack and I get
to meet with opposing council.

12:37.438 --> 12:39.170
But before I sit at the table,

12:39.172 --> 12:41.061
I'd like to know
what kind of cards I'm holding.

12:41.063 --> 12:43.203
Well, it turns out

12:43.205 --> 12:46.470
the flame retardant Warwick
uses is technically legal

12:46.472 --> 12:47.553
in the United States,

12:47.555 --> 12:50.337
but it's banned in most
of the rest of the world

12:50.339 --> 12:51.937
because of concerns that
it's bioaccummulative

12:51.939 --> 12:53.476
and carcinogenic.

12:53.477 --> 12:54.909
Be careful with that, though, okay?

12:54.911 --> 12:57.909
Those findings are derived
from experiments with rats.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.477
Benny's right.

13:00.064 --> 13:01.611
Rat models are far from perfect

13:01.613 --> 13:03.410
when predicting toxicity in humans.

13:03.412 --> 13:06.144
They're only accurate
about 43% of the time.

13:06.146 --> 13:08.545
Okay, but the science isn't junk, right?

13:08.547 --> 13:11.078
No, it's not junk.
In fact, it's terrifying.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.012
And if I were on the jury,

13:13.482 --> 13:16.678
I'd go full Erin Brockovich
on their ass.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.446
That's quite an image, Cable.

13:19.448 --> 13:20.899
Wait a second.

13:21.690 --> 13:24.145
I smell food.

13:24.608 --> 13:27.113
Nothing personal. Later.

13:29.315 --> 13:31.180
Wow.

13:31.182 --> 13:33.013
What is all this?

13:33.015 --> 13:34.847
Are there lumberjacks
coming for breakfast?

13:34.849 --> 13:37.581
Yeah, I know. I kind of overdid it.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.747
No. It's great.

13:38.749 --> 13:42.181
Just maybe we should offload
some of this onto Zack.

13:42.183 --> 13:44.214
No, he's already gone.
He left for work an hour ago.

13:44.216 --> 13:46.381
He's trying to set up that
meeting with the other side.

13:46.383 --> 13:49.681
Well... his loss.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.948
So...

13:56.950 --> 13:59.182
just you and me here.

14:02.318 --> 14:04.416
Listen, I know it's been a long time,

14:04.862 --> 14:07.016
but I've actually
been thinking about this

14:07.018 --> 14:09.872
a lot, so,

14:09.874 --> 14:12.283
if I asked you to...

14:12.285 --> 14:14.930
do something... with me,

14:15.779 --> 14:17.117
would you at least

14:17.119 --> 14:19.317
think about it?

14:20.739 --> 14:22.417
Give it some thought?

14:56.790 --> 14:58.688
Hello. Zack, good to see you again.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.055
Mr. Dunn.

15:00.057 --> 15:02.188
And you must be Dr. Bull.

15:02.190 --> 15:03.988
I am indeed. Preston Dunn

15:03.990 --> 15:05.284
of Bartlett & Dunn.

15:05.624 --> 15:07.075
Have a seat, please.

15:09.958 --> 15:14.734
So... what can we do for you gentlemen?

15:14.735 --> 15:16.601
Well, Mr. Burnam and I wanted to see

15:16.603 --> 15:17.934
if we could have a conversation

15:17.936 --> 15:19.935
with you about our pending court action.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.035
What about it?

15:22.037 --> 15:23.534
Well, the proposal on the table,

15:23.536 --> 15:27.502
is, in our opinion, exceedingly modest.

15:27.504 --> 15:29.001
It doesn't even speak to the request

15:29.003 --> 15:30.836
for extending water lines

15:30.838 --> 15:32.735
that would bypass the polluted wells

15:32.737 --> 15:36.169
so that our clients could use
clean water

15:36.171 --> 15:38.069
in their homes.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.136
We were hoping we might be able
to convince you

15:40.138 --> 15:44.136
to sweeten the offer and maybe
avoid court altogether.

15:44.138 --> 15:46.170
And why would we do that?

15:46.172 --> 15:48.003
Yeah. Sense of fair play?

15:48.005 --> 15:49.703
Your client's sense of remorse?

15:49.705 --> 15:50.937
You don't want

15:50.939 --> 15:53.070
to be publicly humiliated
in a court of law?

15:53.072 --> 15:55.150
Tell me when to stop.
I got a million of 'em.

15:55.152 --> 15:58.371
Dr. Bull, we have no reason to fear
court.

15:59.133 --> 16:02.327
Our clients firmly believe
they've done nothing illegal.

16:03.042 --> 16:03.938
The fact that there is an offer

16:03.940 --> 16:05.872
on the table is solely a function

16:05.874 --> 16:08.238
of their commitment
to being a good neighbor

16:08.240 --> 16:11.972
and trying to help friends
who have fallen on hard times.

16:11.974 --> 16:14.005
Wow.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.306
You said that like you almost meant it.

16:17.331 --> 16:18.436
Preston,

16:18.438 --> 16:20.539
let me explain something to you.

16:20.541 --> 16:24.173
Yes, you have money on your side,

16:24.175 --> 16:26.940
and a small gaggle of attorneys,

16:26.942 --> 16:30.140
but your gaggle all specialize
in one thing.

16:30.142 --> 16:33.707
Keeping your clients <i>out</i> of court.

16:33.709 --> 16:37.608
And court is where I live
every single day.

16:37.610 --> 16:39.441
I have more experience in court

16:39.443 --> 16:41.842
than all
of Bartlett & Dunn put together.

16:41.844 --> 16:44.541
So if that's where you want
to work this out,

16:44.543 --> 16:46.775
so be it, but if you
wake up in the middle

16:46.777 --> 16:49.342
of the night and change your mind...

16:49.626 --> 16:51.742
that's my cell number.

16:53.010 --> 16:55.309
I need ten times what's on the table,

16:55.311 --> 16:57.542
and those extended pipelines.

16:57.544 --> 16:59.243
That should get it done.

16:59.245 --> 17:02.477
Though, if I were to get
this case in front of a jury,

17:02.479 --> 17:06.410
I think it'd be a lot more
expensive than that.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.111
Ladies.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.627
Gentlemen.

17:12.012 --> 17:14.176
Don't get up. I wouldn't for you.

17:16.378 --> 17:18.644
Was that how it was supposed to go?

17:18.646 --> 17:21.411
Fear's a weapon. We just weaponized you.

17:21.413 --> 17:25.278
And yes, that's how
it was supposed to go.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.212
A trial is a piece of theater.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.046
It's not just the events
that shape the outcome,

17:30.048 --> 17:31.846
but often the order of events.

17:31.848 --> 17:34.612
My suggestion is we put
the scientific experts on first,

17:34.614 --> 17:37.046
then our whistleblower, and then
finish with the plaintiffs.

17:37.048 --> 17:39.646
That makes sense. Save the most
emotional testimony for last.

17:39.648 --> 17:41.746
The problem is,
if the science doesn't land,

17:41.748 --> 17:43.880
the opposition is gonna argue
that there's no reason

17:43.882 --> 17:45.446
to hear from the plaintiffs

17:45.448 --> 17:47.713
because their argument is immaterial.

17:47.715 --> 17:49.214
Well...

17:51.173 --> 17:53.138
Look, okay, we can't do that.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.081
That's the whole reason
I'm in this thing.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.681
I mean, I... I want my mother

17:56.683 --> 17:58.647
to have a chance to talk to these guys.

17:58.649 --> 18:00.615
- What guys?
- The company.

18:00.617 --> 18:01.948
Warwick Furniture Manufacturing.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.915
I want them to hear
what they've done to her,

18:03.917 --> 18:05.448
what they've taken from her.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.949
First her husband, now her life?

18:08.549 --> 18:10.849
Even if we get nothing,
she has to have that moment.

18:10.851 --> 18:12.216
She's <i> entitled</i> to that moment.

18:12.218 --> 18:13.382
Zack,

18:13.384 --> 18:15.950
she's entitled to do
whatever helps us win.

18:15.952 --> 18:18.449
I mean, there are five other plaintiffs.

18:18.451 --> 18:19.850
I don't foresee any reason why

18:19.852 --> 18:21.317
she wouldn't be able to testify, but

18:21.319 --> 18:24.350
let's keep our eyes
on the prize. You understand?

18:26.760 --> 18:28.417
Great.

18:28.843 --> 18:30.710
<i>Now tell me about voir dire.</i>

18:32.386 --> 18:34.817
Well, the judge will
automatically eliminate anybody

18:34.819 --> 18:37.785
from the jury pool
who works for Warwick,

18:37.787 --> 18:40.418
or is related to anybody
who works for Warwick,

18:40.420 --> 18:43.385
or is related to anybody
who <i> used to work</i> for Warwick.

18:43.387 --> 18:45.152
But that is not the problem.

18:45.154 --> 18:48.185
The problem is, in a town like this,

18:48.187 --> 18:50.586
that even if you don't work for Warwick,

18:50.588 --> 18:53.519
you come to believe your
prosperity is tied to theirs.

18:53.521 --> 18:55.519
Yeah. I hadn't thought of that.

18:55.521 --> 18:58.220
So we find the outliers, the anomalies,

18:58.222 --> 19:01.854
people who live in Danville who
are suspicious of big business.

19:01.856 --> 19:05.820
And maybe people who feel
cheated in their lives.

19:06.471 --> 19:08.787
That's interesting. What do you mean?

19:08.789 --> 19:10.920
Well, folks who have been
lied to in the same way

19:10.922 --> 19:12.754
that Warwick lied to the plaintiffs.

19:14.223 --> 19:17.239
You sure you've never
been in a courtroom before?

19:21.290 --> 19:23.355
Big team?

19:23.357 --> 19:25.522
Kind of intimidating.

19:25.524 --> 19:27.022
Little bit.

19:27.024 --> 19:29.755
You've got a big team, too.

19:29.757 --> 19:31.390
You just can't see 'em.

19:38.891 --> 19:40.556
We're right there with you, Zack.

19:40.558 --> 19:42.857
From lawyer to lawyer,
you're gonna kill it, kid.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.857
We're here for you, Zack!

19:47.593 --> 19:49.224
Go get 'em.

19:49.817 --> 19:51.457
The town you live in is on fire.

19:51.459 --> 19:53.158
No water lines, no hydrants.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.724
Only way to stop the fire
is for everyone in town

19:55.726 --> 19:56.991
to form a human train

19:56.993 --> 19:59.692
and pass buckets of water
from person to person.

19:59.694 --> 20:01.558
Finally, the fire's put out,

20:01.560 --> 20:03.825
but three of your neighbors
complain that,

20:03.827 --> 20:05.725
while they were part of the human train,

20:05.727 --> 20:07.625
people dropped buckets of water
on their feet,

20:07.627 --> 20:10.025
and now they have broken toes.

20:10.027 --> 20:12.126
They're suing the town.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.493
What do you think?

20:13.495 --> 20:14.392
About...?

20:14.394 --> 20:15.926
About the three people.

20:15.928 --> 20:18.893
I know where you're going, and...

20:18.895 --> 20:20.627
And...?

20:20.629 --> 20:22.727
I think it's a ridiculous story.

20:22.729 --> 20:25.061
We move to strike this juror,
Your Honor.

20:25.063 --> 20:27.527
Who would you say are some
of your favorite sports teams?

20:27.529 --> 20:28.494
Favorite?

20:28.496 --> 20:30.694
Well, for baseball, I like the Yankees.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.697
Football, Cowboys. And for basketball,

20:32.699 --> 20:34.161
I'm a Golden State guy.

20:34.163 --> 20:35.595
Good God.

20:35.597 --> 20:37.628
This guy's never met
a Goliath he didn't like.

20:37.630 --> 20:41.995
He won't be happy until the
underdog is spayed and neutered.

20:41.997 --> 20:43.696
We move to strike, Your Honor.

20:43.697 --> 20:44.762
So, who's next?

20:44.764 --> 20:46.429
Juror 43.

20:46.431 --> 20:47.963
Her name is Madeline Fox.

20:47.965 --> 20:49.496
She's 29.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.230
She's a project manager,

20:51.232 --> 20:53.096
and she works in software development.

20:53.098 --> 20:54.696
A management position?

20:54.698 --> 20:57.096
In a typically maledominated field.

20:57.098 --> 20:59.430
She might be someone who
can potentially lead a room.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.763
Jury forewoman material. We like that.

21:01.765 --> 21:03.797
And she just filed for divorce.

21:04.231 --> 21:05.597
Infidelity?

21:06.231 --> 21:08.097
Cable says yes.

21:08.099 --> 21:09.431
Him or her?

21:10.066 --> 21:11.965
I just got a nonverbal "him."

21:11.967 --> 21:13.132
Excellent.

21:13.134 --> 21:14.498
Woman's already of a mind that the world

21:14.500 --> 21:16.298
and its institutions are corrupt,

21:16.300 --> 21:18.764
that vows and promises are worthless.

21:18.766 --> 21:20.832
Shouldn't be hard
to convince her that Warwick is

21:20.834 --> 21:23.765
just one more
in a line of big institutions

21:23.767 --> 21:25.398
built to let people down.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.532
Do you have any questions
for this juror?

21:29.275 --> 21:30.433
No, Your Honor.

21:30.435 --> 21:32.266
We find this juror acceptable.

21:32.268 --> 21:33.566
Mr. Dunn?

21:33.568 --> 21:34.666
We, too,

21:34.668 --> 21:36.233
accept this juror, Your Honor.

21:36.235 --> 21:38.033
Good. We'll begin

21:38.035 --> 21:39.867
tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

21:47.569 --> 21:49.001
That was weird.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.968
They seemed almost as happy to
have that last juror as we did.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.201
I know.

21:53.203 --> 21:55.068
Something's wrong.

21:59.244 --> 22:01.976
I need to know why the other
side's okay with that juror.

22:02.017 --> 22:03.315
Just doesn't make any sense.

22:03.317 --> 22:05.015
I don't know what to tell you, Bull.

22:05.017 --> 22:06.915
She's an introvert.
She's antibig business.

22:06.917 --> 22:08.516
There's nothing
in her motivational matrix

22:08.518 --> 22:10.749
that would seem to make her
attractive to the defense.

22:10.751 --> 22:13.482
Which means we don't fully
understand their strategy.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.816
Maybe I put too much weight
on the juror's divorce.

22:17.446 --> 22:18.916
I thought for sure
we could use her anger

22:18.918 --> 22:22.850
at her exhusband's cheating
and channel it towards Warwick.

22:23.446 --> 22:25.151
- What am I missing?
- Just a thought,

22:25.153 --> 22:27.518
but maybe they like her
for the same reasons we do.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.718
I don't follow that at all.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.918
Well, maybe they think that
someone on our side is cheating,

22:31.920 --> 22:33.551
being less than truthful.

22:35.031 --> 22:36.885
No, that's crazy. Who's cheating?

22:36.887 --> 22:38.318
Who's being less than truthful?

22:38.320 --> 22:40.552
I swear, I can vouch for
every plaintiff. I can vouch

22:40.554 --> 22:41.985
- for every witness.
- I can, too.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.452
Be that as it may,

22:43.865 --> 22:45.318
here's what we need to do.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.619
I want everyone at TAC

22:46.621 --> 22:48.685
to doublecheck everyone on our side.

22:48.687 --> 22:51.919
The whistleblower,
the expert witnesses... everyone.

22:51.921 --> 22:53.586
Look, I'm not sure Benny's right,

22:53.588 --> 22:56.052
but it's the most plausible
explanation I've heard.

22:56.054 --> 22:58.154
Look for any inconsistencies,

22:58.156 --> 23:00.154
anything that can be painted as a lie.

23:00.156 --> 23:01.987
And I need it done tonight.

23:02.620 --> 23:03.887
Okay.

23:04.799 --> 23:06.454
I think we should shake things up,

23:06.991 --> 23:09.687
do anything we can to throw
the other side offbalance.

23:10.075 --> 23:11.634
Tomorrow, in court, let's lead

23:11.636 --> 23:12.854
with the victims.

23:13.284 --> 23:16.988
Save our whistleblowers
and expert witnesses for last.

23:27.091 --> 23:28.356
If I had known

23:28.358 --> 23:30.422
that making breakfast
was part of the package,

23:30.981 --> 23:33.157
I might have followed you
to that college.

23:38.203 --> 23:39.457
Okay.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.323
Here's something you don't know.

23:41.952 --> 23:44.857
Those 16 times I came
by your house that summer

23:44.859 --> 23:46.578
to say goodbye,

23:47.459 --> 23:51.091
what I really wanted to do
was get you to run away with me,

23:51.093 --> 23:53.224
make a baby with me,

23:53.871 --> 23:57.925
live over a store with me in
some town where nobody knew us.

23:58.496 --> 24:00.425
I was completely prepared
to get a job at a gas station

24:00.427 --> 24:02.758
or a pizza parlor... whatever it took.

24:03.163 --> 24:05.288
But college...

24:07.622 --> 24:10.459
was this thing I was supposed to do.

24:12.914 --> 24:14.955
You were this thing I had to do.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.093
Every Bruce Springsteen song
I ever heard

24:18.095 --> 24:20.560
told me that was true.

24:23.998 --> 24:27.161
I just couldn't get the words
to come out of my mouth.

24:28.540 --> 24:30.594
You're forgiven.

24:31.082 --> 24:33.262
That was a long time ago.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.662
God.

24:39.041 --> 24:41.195
What are you doing up so early?

24:41.625 --> 24:43.562
Well, I'm glad you asked.

24:45.209 --> 24:46.495
I got a call.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.596
From someone who works for me.

24:50.250 --> 24:53.296
They think they know what the
defense has up their sleeves,

24:53.298 --> 24:54.796
who the cheater is.

24:54.798 --> 24:56.796
Well, fantastic. Who?

24:56.798 --> 24:58.097
They think it's you.

24:59.001 --> 25:00.364
I got an email with a copy

25:00.366 --> 25:03.197
of your greatgrandfather's
death certificate.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.931
Okay...

25:05.933 --> 25:08.430
You aware that he died of lung cancer?

25:08.432 --> 25:11.131
1939. Houston Plaza Hospital.

25:11.133 --> 25:13.498
I don't think I even remember

25:13.500 --> 25:15.732
the guy's first name. The man

25:15.734 --> 25:19.032
had died over 30 years
before I was even born.

25:19.034 --> 25:20.498
The problem is,
on your insurance application,

25:20.500 --> 25:24.332
you indicate no history
of cancer in your family.

25:24.334 --> 25:26.366
And that matters why?

25:27.003 --> 25:29.199
II mean, I wasn't lying.

25:29.201 --> 25:30.366
II forgot.

25:30.368 --> 25:31.933
If I even ever knew.

25:31.935 --> 25:33.100
It's not like I have lung cancer.

25:33.102 --> 25:34.666
I have kidney cancer.

25:34.668 --> 25:36.866
Allison, I believe you.

25:37.338 --> 25:39.967
But the defense,
if they get you on the stand,

25:39.969 --> 25:43.067
they will use that
and they will tear you apart.

25:46.339 --> 25:47.834
You're not gonna let me testify.

25:47.836 --> 25:49.868
No. That's not what I'm saying.

25:49.870 --> 25:51.601
I'm just not gonna put you on the stand

25:51.603 --> 25:53.468
and give them that opportunity.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.302
Now, if they want to question
you, they can call you.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.768
But that'll take a couple of days,

25:57.770 --> 25:59.669
and... we can figure out

25:59.671 --> 26:01.269
what they're doing, where they're going.

26:02.371 --> 26:04.836
And what if they don't call me?

26:11.049 --> 26:12.837
Allison,

26:13.508 --> 26:14.870
whatever you're gonna say...

26:14.872 --> 26:17.070
Don't say it doesn't matter.

26:17.549 --> 26:20.337
You got to make your little
"Born to Run" speech to me.

26:20.339 --> 26:22.404
I don't get to give one to them?

26:22.406 --> 26:25.871
To the jackals who took my husband?

26:26.383 --> 26:27.905
Telling him he had to make his numbers,

26:27.907 --> 26:29.471
even during a blizzard.

26:29.473 --> 26:33.905
To the greedy pigs
who dumped poison in my water.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.372
I don't get my turn?

26:39.968 --> 26:43.406
You're not gonna be dead
in 12 to 16 months.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.206
What'd you say to my mom?

26:49.208 --> 26:51.427
I told her that life...

26:53.552 --> 26:56.240
court... isn't fair.

26:57.261 --> 26:58.907
You don't think she knows that?

27:00.220 --> 27:02.274
I told her we weren't
gonna put her on the stand.

27:02.762 --> 27:04.340
I wish you hadn't done that.

27:04.342 --> 27:05.929
Why? Were you gonna tell her?

27:09.471 --> 27:12.942
People are entrusting you
with their futures,

27:13.387 --> 27:14.975
their family's futures.

27:14.977 --> 27:16.542
They've got to count on the fact

27:16.544 --> 27:19.142
that you will do the hard
things, the tough things.

27:19.144 --> 27:20.276
Even though it's

27:20.278 --> 27:21.722
no fun.

27:24.263 --> 27:26.056
Aren't you glad you asked?

27:27.411 --> 27:28.576
Mr. Burnam.

27:29.264 --> 27:31.843
- Your first witness.
- Yes, Your Honor.

27:31.845 --> 27:34.277
The plaintiffs would like
to call Brian McCannon.

27:36.765 --> 27:38.177
Morning, Brian.

27:38.179 --> 27:39.510
How you feeling?

27:39.512 --> 27:41.178
Today's a good day.

27:41.180 --> 27:44.044
I get both kinds,
but today's a good one.

27:44.046 --> 27:45.311
That's great to hear.

27:45.313 --> 27:46.711
Now, you live on land

27:46.713 --> 27:48.511
that has its own well, do you not?

27:48.891 --> 27:49.845
I sure do.

27:49.847 --> 27:51.611
Quarter mile from the factory.

27:51.613 --> 27:54.763
And speaking of bad days,
you've been sick a lot lately,

27:54.765 --> 27:55.912
- haven't you?
- Yes.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.045
Just over the past year.

27:58.047 --> 27:59.746
And what were your initial symptoms?

28:00.225 --> 28:02.712
Well, truth be told,
I hadn't felt well for a while,

28:02.714 --> 28:04.679
but it wasn't until my first seizure

28:04.681 --> 28:06.580
that I realized
something was very wrong.

28:06.582 --> 28:08.480
You want to tell us what happened?

28:08.768 --> 28:10.684
I was grocery shopping.

28:11.518 --> 28:13.780
Standing in the bread aisle,
and I just picked up

28:13.782 --> 28:15.080
a loaf of white bread,

28:15.082 --> 28:17.093
and I was gonna put it in my cart

28:17.095 --> 28:20.548
- when I felt this thing.
- I know you can't see it,

28:20.550 --> 28:22.447
but our lady's leaning in.

28:22.449 --> 28:24.514
I thought there was maybe an earthquake.

28:24.516 --> 28:25.848
Series of explosions,

28:25.850 --> 28:29.015
vibrations or something.

28:29.399 --> 28:30.302
And then I realized

28:30.304 --> 28:31.769
it was me.

28:32.686 --> 28:34.515
I was vibrating. I was shaking.

28:34.517 --> 28:37.187
My hand. The bread.

28:38.187 --> 28:41.882
And I remember just kind of deciding,

28:42.853 --> 28:43.982
I'm gonna sit right down here

28:43.984 --> 28:45.216
on the floor of this grocery store

28:45.218 --> 28:47.050
until whatever this is passes.

28:47.052 --> 28:49.050
And I started to bend down to do that,

28:49.052 --> 28:51.050
and I somehow must have hit
my head on the floor.

28:51.052 --> 28:53.284
And they called 911.

28:53.286 --> 28:54.883
Bull, can you hear me?

28:54.885 --> 28:56.784
Danny, what is it? I'm kind of busy.

28:56.786 --> 28:58.417
Bull, you need to call for a recess.

28:58.419 --> 29:00.084
Whatever you do,
do not let the other side

29:00.086 --> 29:02.817
- crossexamine.
- And that's when Dr. Cartwright started

29:02.819 --> 29:03.918
the battery of tests.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.084
What kind of tests?

29:05.086 --> 29:07.285
A bunch on me, and a bunch on my water.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.418
And what did they reveal?

29:08.420 --> 29:11.285
That my water was sick
and that I was sicker.

29:12.387 --> 29:14.219
You can read it all for yourself.

29:14.221 --> 29:15.919
It's all there in black and white.

29:17.065 --> 29:18.052
Your witness.

29:18.054 --> 29:19.819
Your Honor, we'd like to
call for a recess.

29:19.821 --> 29:20.953
What?

29:20.955 --> 29:22.186
I'm confused.

29:22.188 --> 29:24.120
Are you the attorney of record?

29:24.122 --> 29:25.352
No, Mr. Burnam is.

29:25.354 --> 29:27.353
And can't you speak for yourself?

29:27.355 --> 29:29.149
Yeah, of course I can.

29:32.189 --> 29:33.754
The plaintiffs would like to request

29:33.756 --> 29:34.887
a short recess.

29:34.889 --> 29:36.087
Request denied.

29:36.089 --> 29:38.054
We've barely gotten started here.

29:38.056 --> 29:39.921
Mr. Dunn, would you like

29:39.923 --> 29:41.321
to crossexamine this witness?

29:41.323 --> 29:43.121
I certainly would.

29:51.527 --> 29:52.855
Mr. McCannon...

29:52.857 --> 29:53.901
Just...

29:55.151 --> 29:57.189
I'd like to ask a few questions

29:57.191 --> 29:58.722
about your physician,

29:58.724 --> 30:02.356
Dr. Wallace Cartwright.

30:02.358 --> 30:04.423
Okay, sure.

30:04.425 --> 30:07.323
How long has Dr. Cartwright been
your primary care physician?

30:07.325 --> 30:09.623
At least a couple years.

30:10.903 --> 30:13.124
Our records say 22 months.

30:13.778 --> 30:15.357
Whatever.

30:15.861 --> 30:16.924
But you wouldn't take issue

30:16.926 --> 30:20.057
with the fact that he
became your doctor after news

30:20.059 --> 30:22.058
of the lawsuit was on TV?

30:22.060 --> 30:24.225
The Internet? In the papers?

30:24.227 --> 30:25.791
Objection. Relevance.

30:25.793 --> 30:27.258
Seriously?

30:32.821 --> 30:34.825
No, I wouldn't take issue with that.

30:37.030 --> 30:39.259
Now, isn't Dr. Cartwright also a...

30:40.030 --> 30:41.560
personal friend of yours?

30:42.113 --> 30:43.493
Someone you grew up with?

30:43.495 --> 30:45.393
Again, Your Honor. Relevance.

30:46.031 --> 30:47.693
I guarantee you,

30:47.695 --> 30:50.027
there's abundant relevance, Your Honor.

30:50.029 --> 30:51.260
Overruled.

30:51.262 --> 30:53.127
The defense believes this witness,

30:53.129 --> 30:54.889
with the help of his friend,

30:54.891 --> 30:56.694
has falsified his medical record

30:56.696 --> 30:59.195
in order to profit from this lawsuit.

30:59.197 --> 31:01.861
And to prove it, we would happily pay

31:01.863 --> 31:03.428
for an independent exam

31:03.430 --> 31:06.228
from a mutually agreed upon physician.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.033
Mr. McCannon...

31:08.950 --> 31:11.461
would you be open to such an exam?

31:13.298 --> 31:14.696
WWhat do I do? Do I object?

31:14.698 --> 31:16.095
What's the point?

31:16.097 --> 31:18.462
Look at her. She's already
made up her mind.

31:19.242 --> 31:20.629
She knows a liar

31:20.631 --> 31:22.696
and a cheat when she sees one.

31:28.925 --> 31:31.461
Dr. Bull, maybe
it's not as bad as you think.

31:31.463 --> 31:33.682
Zack, I appreciate you've
never done this before,

31:33.683 --> 31:35.382
but believe me when I tell you,

31:35.384 --> 31:38.182
it's absolutely as bad as I think.

31:38.184 --> 31:40.082
- Really?
- Really.

31:40.827 --> 31:44.149
This case revolves around one juror.

31:44.151 --> 31:45.582
One.

31:45.584 --> 31:48.416
And right now she thinks that Brian

31:48.418 --> 31:50.383
and, by association, your clients...

31:50.385 --> 31:53.984
all of them... are liars and cheats,

31:53.986 --> 31:56.438
just like the man
she used to call her husband.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.417
But the defense can't prove
that Brian or his doctor

31:59.419 --> 32:01.384
actually falsified those records.

32:01.386 --> 32:03.518
Only that he won't agree
to take another exam.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.329
And you don't find that damning?

32:07.393 --> 32:08.925
So what do we do now?

32:08.950 --> 32:10.281
You know the answer to that.

32:10.420 --> 32:12.163
We have to cut him loose.

32:13.372 --> 32:14.552
We're okay here...

32:14.554 --> 32:16.418
And we have to let that jury...

32:16.420 --> 32:18.418
and particularly that juror...

32:18.420 --> 32:21.119
know that we find
that kind of dishonesty

32:21.121 --> 32:23.253
even more repugnant than she does.

32:23.255 --> 32:25.986
- And what do we say to Brian?
- I don't know.

32:25.988 --> 32:28.553
How about, "Thanks
for screwing up our case."

32:28.555 --> 32:31.313
Or "I really liked
the supermarket story",

32:31.315 --> 32:34.887
but how about if you're sick
the next time you use it?"

32:34.889 --> 32:36.487
I've got one.

32:36.489 --> 32:38.087
"You still have to pay us."

32:38.089 --> 32:39.521
We'll pick and choose, mix and match,

32:39.523 --> 32:41.057
but it'll be one of those.

32:41.059 --> 32:42.854
I can do this.

32:42.856 --> 32:46.421
The hard stuff, the tough stuff.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.208
I'll do it.

32:54.290 --> 32:56.875
Hey, um...

33:15.726 --> 33:18.091
Can Ally come out and play?

33:18.585 --> 33:20.191
I don't think that's wise.

33:20.193 --> 33:21.358
I'll be your best friend.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.024
- Jason...
- Allison...

33:23.026 --> 33:24.358
- No.
- Okay.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.391
I'm coming up.

33:25.393 --> 33:26.958
What?

33:26.960 --> 33:28.424
No, stop it.

33:28.426 --> 33:29.658
Okay.

33:29.660 --> 33:30.758
I'm coming down, damn it.

33:30.760 --> 33:31.925
Just give me a minute.

33:35.094 --> 33:36.656
I know I was the one

33:36.658 --> 33:38.045
who said you shouldn't,

33:38.608 --> 33:40.325
but I'd like you to testify.

33:40.796 --> 33:42.492
Tomorrow.

33:42.494 --> 33:43.796
First thing.

33:45.028 --> 33:47.460
Something really bad must
have happened today.

33:48.362 --> 33:51.129
I was wrong about who
they thought cheated.

33:51.829 --> 33:54.393
Your son handled it
masterfully, by the way.

33:55.708 --> 33:57.594
We're gonna lose, aren't we?

33:57.596 --> 34:00.060
There's no way you would let
me anywhere near that stand

34:00.062 --> 34:01.761
if you thought we had a shot at winning.

34:04.602 --> 34:06.067
I don't know what's gonna happen.

34:06.092 --> 34:08.357
I know we have our experts,
they have their experts,

34:08.752 --> 34:11.161
but the bottom line
is we can't prove what they did

34:11.163 --> 34:14.629
caused what happened
to you and your neighbors.

34:14.630 --> 34:16.174
And they can't prove it didn't.

34:16.731 --> 34:18.495
The chemicals they used aren't illegal,

34:18.496 --> 34:20.695
although the way they disposed
of them was reckless,

34:20.697 --> 34:23.396
which means it all comes down
to what a jury thinks.

34:23.398 --> 34:25.129
And right now that jury thinks

34:25.130 --> 34:27.050
that we are not
shooting straight with them.

34:28.165 --> 34:30.092
And I would like to know

34:30.465 --> 34:32.531
that somebody got something
that they wanted

34:32.533 --> 34:33.783
out of this.

34:33.784 --> 34:36.597
So, as a favor to me...

34:36.599 --> 34:38.664
if you're not doing anything...

34:38.666 --> 34:40.630
happen to be in the neighborhood...

34:40.632 --> 34:43.231
don't have an issue
putting your hand on a Bible...

34:43.233 --> 34:45.538
would you mind speaking your piece

34:45.540 --> 34:47.009
in court?

34:49.266 --> 34:51.864
Call your witness, Mr. Burnam.

34:51.867 --> 34:54.802
The plaintiffs would like
to call Allison Burnam.

35:02.344 --> 35:04.432
Hey, Mom.

35:04.434 --> 35:05.761
Hey, kiddo.

35:09.554 --> 35:11.595
How long have you lived in Danville?

35:12.971 --> 35:15.167
Over a quartercentury.

35:15.169 --> 35:17.635
Virtually my entire adult life.

35:18.030 --> 35:19.395
And what brought you here?

35:19.637 --> 35:21.768
Warwick Furniture Manufacturing.

35:21.770 --> 35:24.434
My husband... we were newlyweds...

35:24.436 --> 35:27.055
got a job with Warwick as a salesman.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.068
And your husband...

35:29.070 --> 35:30.835
my father...

35:30.837 --> 35:32.930
is no longer with us, correct?

35:33.371 --> 35:35.222
He died in 2004.

35:35.804 --> 35:38.335
He was driving up to Buffalo
on a sales call.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.769
There was a blizzard

35:39.771 --> 35:42.515
and a bad traffic accident
on the thruway.

35:42.971 --> 35:44.515
11 cars...

35:44.578 --> 35:48.703
So given all that time, and all
that you've been through...

35:48.705 --> 35:51.371
all that you're going through now,

35:51.373 --> 35:53.337
you must have some strong feelings

35:53.339 --> 35:55.271
about Danville and Warwick.

35:55.932 --> 35:57.104
I do.

35:57.106 --> 35:59.137
Objection. Relevance.

35:59.139 --> 36:00.891
Objection overruled.

36:01.074 --> 36:03.105
Please continue.

36:03.307 --> 36:04.938
You were saying...

36:07.367 --> 36:09.532
I love Danville.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.472
You were born here.

36:14.142 --> 36:16.439
Our house is here.

36:17.941 --> 36:20.961
We had all those Halloweens,

36:20.963 --> 36:23.476
all those... everything's.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.940
Magical things happen in this town.

36:28.435 --> 36:30.374
I even had an old boyfriend

36:30.376 --> 36:33.852
show up out of the blue
to try and help me today.

36:37.243 --> 36:39.174
And how do you feel about Warwick?

36:39.176 --> 36:40.841
Objection, Your Honor.

36:40.843 --> 36:44.208
What possible relevance could
the plaintiff's feelings

36:44.210 --> 36:46.441
- for the defendant have?
- Counselor.

36:46.443 --> 36:48.575
Sit down and be quiet.

36:49.937 --> 36:51.608
You were saying.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.775
Warwick...

36:53.479 --> 36:55.396
I am...

36:56.499 --> 36:58.196
so grateful to them,

36:58.344 --> 37:00.014
for so many things.

37:00.668 --> 37:02.143
You listening to this?

37:02.145 --> 37:03.277
Did you prep her?

37:03.279 --> 37:04.343
Tell her what to say?

37:04.345 --> 37:05.355
No.

37:06.512 --> 37:07.677
It's all her.

37:07.786 --> 37:09.217
So explain this to me.

37:09.379 --> 37:11.070
You have kidney cancer.

37:11.346 --> 37:14.311
You lost your husband. This trial today

37:14.336 --> 37:16.767
has wiped you out financially.

37:16.792 --> 37:18.858
And yet you're saying you're grateful?

37:19.356 --> 37:22.773
I'm not grateful for the cancer,
of course.

37:22.798 --> 37:26.815
And I would trade... anything

37:27.613 --> 37:29.148
to have my husband back.

37:31.468 --> 37:33.274
And there are days when
I'm really bitter.

37:35.895 --> 37:39.958
But... I know, in my heart,

37:39.983 --> 37:43.780
that Warwick didn't put
the ice on the highway

37:43.782 --> 37:47.247
that made my husband's car hit
the car in front of him.

37:47.567 --> 37:49.547
They pushed him to sell, sure.

37:49.549 --> 37:52.548
But he was a big boy
and he would have pushed back

37:52.550 --> 37:53.859
if he wanted to.

37:55.416 --> 37:57.514
He loved his job.

37:58.151 --> 38:01.048
And that's the reason he
was on the road that day.

38:01.050 --> 38:03.081
That's the reason we lived here.

38:03.083 --> 38:05.682
It's the reason we're all here today.

38:10.710 --> 38:12.554
As far as the cancer...

38:14.552 --> 38:18.683
I know that no one put poison
in the ground

38:18.685 --> 38:20.316
knowing that it would do this.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.067
They couldn't have.

38:22.069 --> 38:24.537
They're my friends,
they're my neighbors.

38:24.539 --> 38:26.850
And I know that the company
stopped doing it

38:26.852 --> 38:30.083
as soon as they realized that
it was seeping into the wells.

38:30.085 --> 38:32.612
So if you're okay with everything,

38:33.386 --> 38:35.251
why are we here?

38:37.793 --> 38:40.258
I guess we're here because

38:40.822 --> 38:42.818
when bad things started happening

38:42.820 --> 38:44.885
to the people who depended on
that water,

38:44.887 --> 38:46.863
and we went to Warwick for help,

38:47.467 --> 38:51.281
instead of saying,
"How can we help you?"

38:52.322 --> 38:53.990
they said, "Prove it."

38:54.439 --> 38:56.586
And I think

38:56.588 --> 39:00.320
we were all just... stunned.

39:00.948 --> 39:03.224
It was as if our friends,

39:03.226 --> 39:05.115
our neighbors...

39:05.990 --> 39:08.713
our town no longer cared for us.

39:08.738 --> 39:11.702
This town <i> is</i> Warwick.

39:12.814 --> 39:15.954
I mean, if my dog got out of my backyard

39:15.956 --> 39:19.421
and bit the little boy who lives
next door to me,

39:19.423 --> 39:21.122
I would run over there and I would say,

39:21.124 --> 39:22.454
"What can I do to help?

39:22.456 --> 39:23.721
"Can I drive you to the hospital?

39:23.723 --> 39:24.888
Can I pay for the doctor?"

39:24.890 --> 39:26.556
I wouldn't say, "Those don't look"

39:26.558 --> 39:28.022
like my dog's teeth marks."

39:28.024 --> 39:30.187
And how much did you
and the others ask for?

39:30.189 --> 39:34.285
Enough to cover our medical
bills and time lost from work.

39:34.818 --> 39:37.016
And also that they repipe our wells

39:37.041 --> 39:38.673
to a safe water source.

39:38.698 --> 39:40.496
And how much did they offer?

39:40.559 --> 39:43.057
Nothing, as far as the wells go.

39:43.059 --> 39:47.924
And about a tenth of the money
we needed to be made whole.

39:50.026 --> 39:53.424
And still... you're not mad?

39:55.606 --> 39:56.953
I have my moments,

39:57.496 --> 40:00.120
but... no.

40:00.594 --> 40:04.370
It would be like being mad at myself.

40:05.081 --> 40:06.678
If that makes any sense.

40:07.412 --> 40:09.037
It does to me.

40:13.795 --> 40:15.092
No further questions.

40:16.162 --> 40:18.593
Is the defense prepared to cross?

40:18.595 --> 40:22.093
Absolutely, Your Honor,
if I could just beg

40:22.095 --> 40:25.378
the court's indulgence
for a brief recess.

40:25.380 --> 40:28.179
We'll take a 15minute recess.

40:35.930 --> 40:37.862
That was amazing.

40:37.864 --> 40:39.028
Thank you.

40:40.564 --> 40:43.330
Did I just just make a total
fool out of myself up there?

40:43.355 --> 40:45.332
Not even close, Mom.

40:46.784 --> 40:48.025
How you feeling?

40:48.050 --> 40:49.489
Pretty good.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.378
Thanks for making it happen.

40:57.631 --> 41:02.163
If you folks will
excuse me for a moment...

41:03.179 --> 41:05.377
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Yeah, of course.

41:12.926 --> 41:15.458
20 times our original offer.

41:15.646 --> 41:17.516
And we'll take care of the piping.

41:17.833 --> 41:20.598
Let's just end this now.

41:20.967 --> 41:22.835
That's very generous.

41:24.334 --> 41:27.066
You have to get her her
house back from the bank.

41:27.068 --> 41:29.399
In fact, for all her pain and suffering,

41:29.401 --> 41:31.666
you have to pay it off.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.795
Come on. I'm doing your work here.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.004
Trying to keep you out of court.

41:41.936 --> 41:43.504
Done.

41:55.836 --> 41:57.135
Hey, you guys wait out here.

41:57.137 --> 41:58.940
I'll go and get my mom and Dr. Bull.

41:58.942 --> 42:00.607
Um, but give me a minute.

42:00.608 --> 42:02.006
She might be resting.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.342
She coming out?

42:30.344 --> 42:32.709
No. I don't, I don't think so.

42:32.711 --> 42:35.575
Um, she's kind of down for the count.

42:35.577 --> 42:36.876
And Dr. Bull?

42:36.878 --> 42:38.442
Him, too.

42:38.740 --> 42:40.542
But I'm thinking picnic in the park!
