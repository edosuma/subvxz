WEBVTT

00:04.709 --> 00:06.667
Hey, Turk, I'm gonna go across the
street and get some coffee.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.667
-You want one?
-Get me a small one-pump mocha.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.417
(J.D.)<i> The perfect setup to a joke,</i>
<i>but no one's around to hear.</i>

00:12.500 --> 00:14.542
Whoo! Dude!

00:14.625 --> 00:19.625
Oh, God! Ohh! Ohhhh! Dude!

00:19.709 --> 00:21.041
(panting)

00:21.125 --> 00:22.500
So, what did you
want me to get you?

00:22.583 --> 00:23.834
A small one-pump mocha?

00:23.917 --> 00:25.750
Wasn't that your nickname
in high school?

00:25.834 --> 00:28.542
Hello! (chuckles irritatingly)

00:28.625 --> 00:31.041
Dude, there's a guy upstairs waitin'
to have his spleen removed.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.375
It was worth it.

00:34.917 --> 00:35.959
Let's go, Per.

00:36.041 --> 00:37.834
I've been waiting for an hour.

00:37.917 --> 00:40.417
I know. I was leafing through
a magazine

00:40.500 --> 00:42.542
and watching you
on the security cameras.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.041
My favorite part is when
you said, "screw her!"

00:45.125 --> 00:46.959
Then you stormed out,
but then you came back

00:47.041 --> 00:49.208
'cause you realized...
I have the keys.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.417
Jordan, now that
you work here every day,

00:51.500 --> 00:53.875
-if the carpool torturing persists,
-right...

00:53.959 --> 00:55.709
...I'm gonna put
a Plexiglas separator

00:55.792 --> 00:58.125
right down the middle of the car so
you can't drive me crazy.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.542
You can't, you can't, you can't.
(chuckles)

00:59.625 --> 01:03.208
Unfortunately, your door handle
doesn't work from the inside,

01:03.291 --> 01:06.959
which simply means that if we're
in a fiery crash,

01:07.041 --> 01:08.375
-you won't be able to get out.
-Oh.

01:08.458 --> 01:12.000
However, that's a risk
I'm sure willing to take.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.000
Jorderoo?

01:16.667 --> 01:17.709
Hello!

01:17.792 --> 01:19.417
(playfully) I'm in here.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.291
You can't see me.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.792
Jordan! Ohhh...

01:23.875 --> 01:26.417
(J.D.)<i> Not everyone was</i>
<i>in hell at their job.</i>

01:26.500 --> 01:28.125
<i>In fact, there was only one thing</i>

01:28.208 --> 01:30.333
<i>Elliot didn't like</i>
<i>about her new hospital--</i>

01:30.417 --> 01:32.250
<i>Charlie, her co-fellow.</i>

01:33.250 --> 01:35.792
Aaahhh! (splat) Ohhh!

01:37.709 --> 01:39.709
-Good morning, Charlie.
-Uh, do you want to work

01:39.792 --> 01:42.125
on the osteogenesis imperfecta
therapy with me?

01:42.208 --> 01:44.542
Charlie, I'm gonna tell you the same
thing I told you yesterday

01:44.625 --> 01:46.125
when you popped out
of that Hazmat bin:

01:46.208 --> 01:49.417
I work alone, and you have somebody
else's blood on your neck.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.500
Take a shower, man.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.500
Fine. I'll just go.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.959
(sighs)

01:59.250 --> 02:01.291
Aaaahhh!

02:01.375 --> 02:02.375
Yes!

02:02.959 --> 02:05.333
That is an intern in a bald cap.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.542
I hate you, Charlie.

02:12.709 --> 02:14.083
Hippocratic oath on 3.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.166
1, 2, 3.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.125
(all) First, do no harm!

02:18.208 --> 02:20.750
There it is. All right.
Kick some ass today, guys.

02:20.834 --> 02:24.250
Except for Mr. Woodsen in 302.
He's got that rectal tear.

02:24.333 --> 02:27.500
You seem to be developing quite the
rapport with your interns.

02:27.583 --> 02:28.917
We even spent this weekend

02:29.000 --> 02:31.792
-building a house for the homeless.
-How'd that go?

02:34.125 --> 02:37.625
(laughter)

02:37.709 --> 02:38.709
Thanks.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.083
-(laughs)
-(saw buzzing)

02:41.166 --> 02:42.792
Ha ha!

02:47.208 --> 02:50.083
In my defense, who wears a tie
to a construction site?

02:50.166 --> 02:52.041
I believe in team-building,
too, newbie,

02:52.125 --> 02:53.875
and I'd make my interns
agree with me,

02:53.959 --> 02:55.208
but they're in a time-out
right now

02:55.291 --> 02:58.458
because one of them used the phrase
"let's rock 'n' roll."

02:58.542 --> 03:01.291
Son, when you're an intern,
you get treated like crap,

03:01.375 --> 03:02.917
and then when you're in a position
of power,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.208
you do the same thing to them.
It's inevitable...

03:05.792 --> 03:07.208
like the tie or the awkward toast

03:07.291 --> 03:09.375
I'm going to have to give someday
at my son's big gay wedding.

03:09.458 --> 03:12.375
Mark my words, eventually, you'll
treat them like dirt

03:12.458 --> 03:13.458
like the rest of us do.

03:13.542 --> 03:15.959
Sir, I'd love to chat,
but it's already 8:00.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.291
I gotta rock 'n' roll.

03:17.792 --> 03:18.917
I beg your pardon?

03:19.542 --> 03:22.625
-I'm an attending.
-Tell it to the wall, newbie.

03:23.917 --> 03:27.542
♪<i> I can't do this</i>
<i>All on my own </i>♪

03:27.625 --> 03:28.834
♪ <i>No, I know</i> ♪

03:28.917 --> 03:30.500

03:34.166 --> 03:35.792

03:38.792 --> 03:40.458
(chuckling)

03:40.542 --> 03:42.542
-The answer's 2.
-What?

03:42.625 --> 03:45.959
How many janitors does it take
to change a light bulb? 2.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.625
Ok, that doesn't make any sense.

03:47.709 --> 03:50.542
Hank's an electrician
and you are not funny.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.333
I'm very funny. Earlier,
I made a killer one-pump mocha joke.

03:54.417 --> 03:55.583
Everybody laughed.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.000
I bet that nobody laughed
but you didn't notice that

03:58.083 --> 04:00.166
'cause you were busy doin'
that cocky self-laugh thing

04:00.250 --> 04:01.667
you do when you think
you're bein' funny.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.959
Wasn't that your nickname
in high school?

04:05.041 --> 04:06.917
Ha ha ha ha ha.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.667
(chuckling slowly)
Anyhoo, have a good one, lurch.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.709
(J.D.)
<i>I had to skedaddle</i>

04:13.792 --> 04:15.875
<i>because today was burger day</i>
<i>in the caf,</i>

04:15.959 --> 04:17.583
<i>and that meant one thing...</i>

04:18.333 --> 04:22.250
<i>75 hungry employees</i>
<i>and one bottle of ketchup.</i>

04:23.375 --> 04:26.000
-Got the ketchup.
-And here is your burger.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.959
Oh, frick. I forgot my burger.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.000
-No, she didn't.
-(laughs)

04:33.625 --> 04:35.667
Hey, how come Elliot never invites
us over to her hospital?

04:35.750 --> 04:38.000
She probably doesn't want you guys
embarrassing her.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.583
How would we embarrass her?

04:39.667 --> 04:43.166
Oh, maybe by diagnosing all your
female patients with Turk fever?

04:43.250 --> 04:45.125
Honey, a lot of women
suffer from that.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.458
It's true. I even had it.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.542
What, that stupid
Siamese twin thing you do?

04:51.375 --> 04:54.000
You mean multi-ethnic Siamese
doctor? Bite, please.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.333
-Here it is.
-Arrmmm! Mmm.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.166
Mmm! That's headed right to our
joint colon.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.041
Yeah. I think I've made my point.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.792
(chuckles) So, tell me something,
Carla.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.291
Has she invited you
to her new hospital?

05:06.375 --> 05:08.166
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

05:08.250 --> 05:09.333
(J.D.) Victory sip.

05:11.792 --> 05:14.542
-Ah!
-Staff mates. Ketchup.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.500
-Ah.
-Is this seat taken?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.000
The ketchup is for winners, Ted.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.625
Jordan, you have to make other
friends in this place.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.625
For the love of God,
the only respite I get from you

05:30.709 --> 05:33.166
is when we're making love and I
pretend you're someone else.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.959
Yeah, I usually pretend we're doing
something else.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.583
-(chuckles)
-(laughs)

05:39.625 --> 05:41.000
-Dammit!
-Dammit!

05:44.125 --> 05:46.291
I am your new friend, so suck it.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.333
I need to go talk to my boys.

05:48.417 --> 05:49.959
Oh, and I have to go talk to Elliot.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.333
No, wait! Don't leave me!

05:51.417 --> 05:53.750
So I hear you and the wife
are trying for a boy.

05:53.834 --> 05:58.834
Little tip. The night that Perry and
I conceived Jack, he was on top.

05:58.917 --> 06:02.166
It was about 3 days before my
ovulation. Yeah.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.875
Oh, and he was choking me. Ggkktt!
Oh, it was good.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.250
Ok, let me just...

06:08.083 --> 06:09.709
My boys need the ketchup!

06:13.417 --> 06:16.208
That's a lot of boys.
Rex gets first dibs

06:16.291 --> 06:18.458
because I opened his chest
with a buzz saw.

06:19.625 --> 06:20.834
J.D., ketchup!

06:23.375 --> 06:25.500
Mmhh. I gotta get back to my
hospital.

06:25.583 --> 06:28.166
I was thinking maybe I'd come by
there and visit you tomorrow.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.917
Tomorrow's not great, but we'll
definitely do it sometime,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.583
you know, um, in the future.
(chuckles)

06:35.917 --> 06:37.125
So, we're having Mexican food

06:37.208 --> 06:38.709
-and drinking water--
-Carla?

06:39.709 --> 06:41.750
-What are you doing here? (chuckles)
-Hey, Elliot.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.417
Let me just finish
telling them the story.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.917
We were at this tiny little ATM
machine... (sighs)

06:47.000 --> 06:49.917
Ohhh... I knew I shouldn't have had
that chimie chonga.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.458
I have to... You know?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.375
-Huh?
-Fff... fff!

06:54.458 --> 06:57.542
Oh. Oh, go for it.
There's mostly guys here.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.000
They'll never think it was you.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.250
(high-pitched fart)

07:02.917 --> 07:04.125
(sighs)

07:04.208 --> 07:06.125
I think that blond girl
just farted.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.375
Ohhh...

07:08.458 --> 07:11.458
-Remember that, Elliot?
-Yeah... I remember.

07:11.542 --> 07:12.709
(chuckles, peeved)

07:13.417 --> 07:16.875
Those 2 new nurses
have wonderful breasts.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.875
Hey... They have names.

07:19.792 --> 07:23.542
Tina, Marge, Sloppy,
and Mr. Snuggles.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.291
Sloppy's bigger than Mr. Snuggles.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.667
What are you guys talkin' about?

07:29.250 --> 07:30.959
-Oh, we were just...
-(whoosh)

07:31.041 --> 07:32.667
-(chair squeaks)
-(whoosh)

07:34.709 --> 07:36.709
Guess they all had someplace to be.

07:36.792 --> 07:38.250
-Just go!
-Ok!

07:39.083 --> 07:41.333
Hey. If you feel like talkin',

07:41.417 --> 07:43.542
I've got a dandy
conversation starter.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.250
I have had someone else's fingers

07:45.333 --> 07:48.542
in 4-- count 'em-- 4 different
orifices... today.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.375
Oh. Must be your birthday.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.291
Ok, gang, I'll meet you
up in radiology

07:53.375 --> 07:55.750
to talk about Mr. Heath's cat scan.

07:55.834 --> 07:57.417
His tumor's getting so big,

07:57.500 --> 07:59.375
it's starting to look like a
three-mor.

07:59.458 --> 08:03.625
-(all laugh)
-(giggles)

08:03.709 --> 08:04.834
Not funny.

08:05.542 --> 08:08.291
Have you been following me around
all day dressed like an intern?

08:08.917 --> 08:10.667
Yes, and you're a terrible teacher.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.333
I'm not prepared
to operate on anyone.

08:12.417 --> 08:15.291
Whatever. If it wasn't funny,
why did they all laugh?

08:15.375 --> 08:16.792
Wake up and smell
the third-floor urinal

08:16.875 --> 08:18.375
I haven't cleaned in 4 years.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.083
Everybody kisses the ass
of the person above them.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.417
I was going to be a cardiologist,
but I didn't have the heart.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.333
(laughs raucously,
then cuts off suddenly)

08:31.417 --> 08:34.417
I was going to be a psychiatrist,
but I was a-Freud.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.458
-Ha ha ha!
-Oh, yeah! Ha ha ha!

08:38.083 --> 08:41.083
I was gonna be a doctor
but I didn't have the patients.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.583
Ha ha ha ha ha!

08:44.333 --> 08:47.417
I was gonna be a vagrant,
but I couldn't raise the dough.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.417
-Ha ha. Funny.
-Ha ha ha!

08:49.750 --> 08:51.667
You know, I was gonna have her
bring you some chicken,

08:51.750 --> 08:52.834
but it was foul.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.041
-(woof)
-Ha ha ha!

08:55.125 --> 08:56.291
You get it now?

08:56.375 --> 08:59.083
Your relationship with your interns
is a sham.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.250
(dog panting)

09:00.333 --> 09:02.000
That dog just laughed at a pun.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.959
Ooh! I'm not gonna lie to you.
That hurts.

09:07.041 --> 09:09.875
Not gonna lie. That hurts.
Tell me about your kid.

09:09.959 --> 09:11.625
Oh, how'd you know I was a mom?

09:11.709 --> 09:14.125
As a parent myself,
I can read the signs. You know?

09:14.208 --> 09:15.500
And let us not forget

09:15.583 --> 09:17.375
the understated coffee mug
we're carrying.

09:17.458 --> 09:18.917
Oh.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.250
(Turk) How do I know that guy?

09:22.083 --> 09:24.250
Maybe... you used to date him.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.500
Oh, that's so clever. I'm gay. Wow.
That's good.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.583
I'm tired.

09:29.542 --> 09:32.375
Maybe he's from the international
pretentious association

09:32.458 --> 09:34.667
and he's here
to remove your goatee.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.208
-So, what do you've, a boy or girl?
-I have a little girl.

09:38.291 --> 09:40.250
Don't get to see her often enough.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.667
Um... see, I don't know,
a few years ago,

09:43.750 --> 09:45.792
I had a little, uh...
business problem.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.291
-What was your business?
-Import, export.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, I would import heroin
into my bloodstream;

09:51.083 --> 09:52.667
I would export vomit and urine

09:52.750 --> 09:54.959
into whatever alley would have me as
a guest. (chuckles)

09:55.583 --> 09:58.083
Oh. Sorry.
That's a little smile I get

09:58.166 --> 09:59.792
when I'm silently judging someone.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.083
Anyway, the thing is, it's Jenny's
sixth birthday on Monday,

10:04.166 --> 10:07.667
and, uh... I'm not really sure that
I can fly out and make it.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.834
It's, uh, it's hard to get a job,
you know?

10:09.917 --> 10:12.458
Money's tight. I've got hospital
bills that I can't pay.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.458
(half-chuckles, half sobs)

10:15.083 --> 10:18.542
-Sam, I am so sorry.
-Yeah...

10:24.083 --> 10:25.208
I know who he is!

10:25.750 --> 10:27.542
-One little problem.
-Oh, my God!

10:27.625 --> 10:30.291
Just give me the drugs. 'K, lady?

10:30.375 --> 10:32.709
For God's sake, I been workin' you
from every possible angle.

10:32.792 --> 10:35.917
That's the junkie who conned Elliot
into giving him meds.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.250
Just got interesting, people.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.250
(J.D.)
<i>The janitor was wrong.</i>

10:41.333 --> 10:44.333
<i>My interns weren't laughing at my</i>
<i>jokes because I'm their boss.</i>

10:44.417 --> 10:45.834
<i>It made me think about how some</i>
<i>people</i>

10:45.917 --> 10:47.750
<i>don't want to just open the door...</i>

10:48.125 --> 10:50.125
<i>Walk in, and see the truth.</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:52.667
Why did you come here, Carla?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.166
You're mad at me?

10:55.250 --> 10:57.083
Why didn't you want me
to come to your job?

10:57.166 --> 11:00.083
Hey, bank farter, if you want,
we're all going down for lunch.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.917
You tell me.

11:03.208 --> 11:06.291
(J.D.) <i>After all, the truth can</i>
<i>reveal the ugliest part of people.</i>

11:06.375 --> 11:09.291
That guy's conned damn near everyone
in this hospital.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.375
I've gotta warn her.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.083
Jordan! Ohh!

11:14.166 --> 11:15.709
(loud thud)

11:19.166 --> 11:20.792
Ohhh... She wanted to work here,

11:20.875 --> 11:22.458
so let her see what it's like
to work here.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.792
And for God's sake,
will you be a man?!

11:27.834 --> 11:28.834
(J.D.) <i>As for me...</i>

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
<i>I already knew</i>
<i>exactly what the truth was.</i>

11:31.583 --> 11:34.583
<i>Plus, my best friend was always</i>
<i>around to back me up.</i>

11:35.625 --> 11:37.291
How funny is this joke?

11:37.375 --> 11:39.542
That patient's tumor is so big,

11:39.625 --> 11:42.208
it's starting to look
like a three-mor.

11:42.291 --> 11:45.125
-Ha ha ha.
-Ha ha ha! Three-mor!

11:45.208 --> 11:47.291
You are hilarious, Dr. D.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.500
Awful.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.083
Awful.

11:52.542 --> 11:53.792
Awful!

11:56.458 --> 11:58.208
(J.D.)<i> Ok, be cool.</i>
<i>They're just kids.</i>

11:58.959 --> 12:02.000
<i>Except Gloria.</i>
<i>What is her deal?</i>

12:03.834 --> 12:07.417
Ok, guys, let's talk for a second as
equals. All right?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.917
Seriously. I'm takin' off
my stethoscope

12:10.000 --> 12:11.834
and my little name tag.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.500
I'm not a doctor right now.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.208
You're still wearin' scrubs.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.959
We are in a hospital, man.

12:19.792 --> 12:22.917
Ok, we're off the property.
Now, let's talk.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.959
-Shouldn't we wait for Gloria?
-Coming!

12:26.667 --> 12:28.000
We'll catch her up later.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.083
Have you guys been
fake laughing at my jokes?

12:30.709 --> 12:34.000
Be honest. I promise
absolutely no ramifications.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.208
Well, we've been
kinda fake laughing.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.083
Keith, I hope you die a violent
death and bugs eat your corpse.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.333
Look, uh, your jokes kinda suck,

12:41.417 --> 12:44.000
and when I laugh,
you pick me to do procedures.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.166
Unbelievable!

12:45.250 --> 12:48.500
From now on, there is absolutely
no laughing at my jokes

12:48.583 --> 12:50.500
unless they're particularly
hysterical.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.458
Talk about your <i>Mission: Impossibles.</i>
(nauseating chuckle)

12:57.166 --> 12:58.500
Case closed.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.417
What is it with you
and the costumes today?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.166
I borrowed it from my brother.
He's a stripper.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.583
(breathlessly) I'm here.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.041
Gloria.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.750
Look, Carla... I didn't want you
to come here because... well...

13:13.542 --> 13:16.083
Look, there is so much
great about you.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.667
You're smart. You're loyal.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.000
You've absolutely shattered all of
my preconceived notions

13:20.083 --> 13:23.125
-about Chicanos.
-Elliot... spring it.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.000
You're a bit of a gossip.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.083
So I'm interested in people's
stories!

13:27.166 --> 13:29.083
Thanks to you,
for the rest of my career,

13:29.166 --> 13:30.959
I have the world's worst nickname.

13:31.041 --> 13:33.583
"Bank farter" is not so bad.
It sounds German.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.500
(speaking German) Don't make fun of
my people, Carla!!

13:36.583 --> 13:38.083
Hey, bank farter, did you hear?

13:38.709 --> 13:41.375
Charlie found a successful
gene therapy for O.I.

13:41.458 --> 13:42.917
He basically cured the disease.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.250
How did he even have any time
to work

13:44.333 --> 13:45.417
when he was always torturing me?!

13:45.500 --> 13:48.000
Jealousy's an ugly color,
bank farter.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.417
Anyway, we're discontinuing
your fellowship.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.333
Frick! Frick! Frick!
Frick! Frick! Frick!

13:53.417 --> 13:55.208
Frick! Frickity
frick, frick, frick!

13:55.917 --> 13:57.375
(quietly) Frick.
(sighs)

14:01.875 --> 14:05.959
I'm not sure how people
go about doing these things.

14:06.542 --> 14:07.542
But here.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.375
You should be there for your
daughter's birthday.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.208
I can't take that.

14:12.709 --> 14:15.583
Come on.
I can't even Botox an ear with this.

14:17.917 --> 14:20.417
Oh. Would everyone
please watch this?

14:20.500 --> 14:23.333
Because nobody, but nobody
cries like Sammy.

14:23.417 --> 14:26.667
He leads off with the chin quiver.

14:27.959 --> 14:29.792
Then he goes right
to the look-away.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.125
He tries to hold it back,
but he just can't

14:33.208 --> 14:34.917
because there's too much pain.

14:36.291 --> 14:41.291
And then finally he squeezes out
one single... tear.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.458
(Dr. Cox mock-sobs)

14:44.542 --> 14:48.250
Ladies and gentlemen, that is some
quality crack addict theater.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.583
I can't watch this.

14:49.917 --> 14:52.000
Then move your big,
bald, biscuit head.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.458
Some of us don't have cable.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.500
This is a little trust exercise

14:57.583 --> 14:59.834
that I really think's
gonna connect us again.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.458
Remove your blindfolds, please.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.667
-See your death.
-Aaahh!

15:07.750 --> 15:09.375
-See your death.
-Aaahh!

15:09.458 --> 15:11.583
-See your death.
-Aaahhh!

15:11.667 --> 15:13.083
Keith...

15:13.166 --> 15:15.083
don't worry, buddy, we're cool.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.208
-Really?
-No! See your death!

15:17.291 --> 15:22.709
No! But I looked up to yooouuuu...

15:22.792 --> 15:24.417
(indistinct chatter)

15:24.500 --> 15:26.000
-It doesn't.
-(laughs)

15:26.083 --> 15:29.083
Hey! Why don't you guys go upstairs
and do some work.

15:30.208 --> 15:33.000
And for God sakes, will somebody
wake up Gloria?

15:37.166 --> 15:39.166
Ok, enough waving.
You wave too much.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.083
You abuse waving. Go.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.208
There it is, just like I said.

15:44.291 --> 15:49.500
I can feel your hatred like a cool
spring breeze. Ah...

15:53.333 --> 15:54.834
(J.D.)<i> Gloria...</i>

15:58.709 --> 16:00.250
I can't believe I don't have a job!

16:01.625 --> 16:02.625
Is that even yours?

16:02.709 --> 16:04.792
I need your support right now,
Carla!

16:05.625 --> 16:08.250
Carla... you cannot tell
Turk and J.D. about this

16:08.333 --> 16:09.750
until I get back on my feet again.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.417
Why? They'll just feel bad for you.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.542
No, they'll be merciless.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.375
Seriously. If you tell, I will never
trust you again with anything.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.917
-Where've you been?
-Nowhere.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.083
-What're you doin'?
-Nothing!

16:32.792 --> 16:35.333
-How's blonde doctor?
-Cheese!

16:36.625 --> 16:38.959
-What's the dish?
-I gotta go.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.166
-Hey.
-No hablo inglés.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.500
Oh, my God. You got that little bit
of saliva on your lips

16:44.583 --> 16:46.333
that says you know somethin' juicy.

16:46.959 --> 16:49.667
-No, I don't.
-Here it comes.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.625
Yes!

16:52.083 --> 16:54.375
-Well, ok. Here's the scoop.
-Yes.

16:54.458 --> 16:57.375
-Here's the scoop, indeed.
-You've gotta promise not to tell.

16:57.458 --> 16:58.792
(Turk) I know.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.291
Sam... what are you
doing back here?

17:06.375 --> 17:08.041
Hey, lamb chop, uh, crazy story.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.291
I was, uh, I was takin' a bus.
And my plane ticket,

17:10.375 --> 17:12.375

He's mad because
they're suckin' up to him,

18:33.083 --> 18:35.583

a jerk attending, too,

18:44.417 --> 18:47.542
go ahead, but don't do it because
they resent you. That's not fair.
