03:29.586 --> 03:30.896

03:30.965 --> 03:33.310

03:33.344 --> 03:34.965
Hurry up, come on we gotta go.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.551

Do you need a snack

03:49.586 --> 03:51.241
- Yeah, cereal.
- No time for cereal.

03:51.310 --> 03:52.344
How about a banana?

03:52.344 --> 03:54.000
- No, juice.
- Juice.

03:55.655 --> 03:56.655
GREYSON:

04:03.620 --> 04:05.034
JAMES:

Oh, right.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.379
Alright, come on, let's go.

04:41.068 --> 04:42.896

- Good morning, James.

04:42.896 --> 04:44.620
Good morning.

04:44.655 --> 04:46.482
GREYSON:
Hey, I put some breakfast up
in here, too.

04:46.551 --> 04:49.379
He wanted cereal,
but we didn't have time so...

04:49.379 --> 04:50.241
No worries.

04:50.275 --> 04:53.413
Maggie, can you put this
with the rest?

04:53.448 --> 04:54.551
MAGGIE:
Of course.

04:57.586 --> 05:00.793
Who's picking him up
this afternoon?

05:00.827 --> 05:01.931
Your mom's gonna com
pick you up later.

05:01.965 --> 05:03.862
That'll be fun, huh?

05:03.931 --> 05:05.965
I want you to come get me.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.586
I know you do,
but it's just gonna be

05:07.620 --> 05:08.620
for a couple of days.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.689
I promise.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.103
SARAH:
You should go.

05:15.137 --> 05:16.655
- Don't wanna be late.
- Okay.

05:16.655 --> 05:17.448
Alright, have fun today, bud.

05:17.482 --> 05:18.586
Thank you.

05:35.448 --> 05:37.137
Fuck!

05:49.793 --> 05:51.000
JOHN:
Yes, this is Tech Fix.

05:53.965 --> 05:55.931
- Good morning.
- : Morning, Zoey.

05:55.965 --> 05:58.379
- How are you?
- Late.

05:58.448 --> 06:00.137
JOHN:
Yes, like I instructed you
to use.

06:08.689 --> 06:09.689
Morning.

06:12.931 --> 06:15.586
You're late.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.103
I know I just had to drop
the kid off on my--

06:17.172 --> 06:19.000
Fourth time this month.

06:20.241 --> 06:21.931
I know.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.862
So what are we doin' about it?

06:22.896 --> 06:23.862
I'm working on it.

06:23.862 --> 06:25.551
And?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.931
And it's just hard, because
I have to get the kid ready,

06:27.965 --> 06:29.448
and I have to drive him
all the way over to daycare.

06:29.517 --> 06:30.862
Yeah, you gotta get
the kid ready,

06:30.896 --> 06:32.172
you gotta take him to daycare.

06:32.206 --> 06:34.689
"I got to, I got to--",
look, I don't care.

06:34.689 --> 06:36.206
We all have problems, okay?

06:36.206 --> 06:38.448
But we all manage to get here
on time

06:38.517 --> 06:40.655
and I don't want
any more excuses, alright?

06:40.689 --> 06:42.206
I'm sorry, it's just--

06:42.241 --> 06:45.517
Grey, just say "alright".

06:45.517 --> 06:48.586
No more excuses, got it?

06:48.655 --> 06:49.689
Alright.

06:53.827 --> 06:56.000
Fuckin' animal, calm down,
we're tryin' to work here.

06:57.931 --> 06:59.448
Good morning.
Thank you for calling Tech Fix.

06:59.517 --> 07:01.068
My name is Greyson.

07:01.103 --> 07:03.103
How can I make you happy
this morning?

07:03.103 --> 07:04.137
Hey, guys!

07:04.137 --> 07:05.620
Kate and I are making a run
to Anthem Coffee.

07:05.655 --> 07:07.172
Does anybody want anything?

07:07.241 --> 07:08.965
- Jim?
- No.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.172
Hey, let me get something.

07:10.241 --> 07:11.620
Hey.
What do you want, John?

07:11.655 --> 07:13.758
Um, we got a caramel macchiato.

07:13.793 --> 07:16.103
- What size?
- Uh, grande.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.068
Thanks.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.965
Go strong with the sugar.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.896
BRODY:
Yeah, Zoey, can I get
a white chocolate mocha?

07:20.931 --> 07:21.965
Venti.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.103
Thanks, Brody.

07:23.103 --> 07:25.586
Oh, I bet it tastes like shit.

07:25.586 --> 07:26.586
Hey, Grey.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.793
Do you want any coffee?

07:28.827 --> 07:32.103
- I gotta pass, thanks.
- You sure?

07:32.137 --> 07:33.793
Give the guy a break, Zoey.

07:33.793 --> 07:36.758
He's a loser tryin' to support
a kid on $12 an hour.

07:36.793 --> 07:38.827
He can't afford coffee.

07:39.965 --> 07:41.068
That.

07:45.275 --> 07:46.620
You're an asshole.

07:46.655 --> 07:48.000
You say that now.

07:49.965 --> 07:52.586
Fucking don't.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.551
ERIC:
Who's in there?

08:09.620 --> 08:10.827
Yeah?

08:10.862 --> 08:13.344
Is that you, Grey?

08:13.379 --> 08:15.172
GREYSON:
Yeah.

08:15.172 --> 08:17.000
Dude, you better not be
jerkin' off in there.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.620
Fuck no.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.827
ERIC:
Come on.

08:53.068 --> 08:54.275
All yours.

09:01.413 --> 09:02.448
-

09:02.448 --> 09:04.758
TRENT:
Yeah, thank you for calling
Tech Fix.

09:04.793 --> 09:07.103
Mmhmm.

09:10.103 --> 09:12.275
I guarantee you.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.241
Okay.

09:14.241 --> 09:16.379
Mmhmm, yes, yes,
it's great to know.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.310
Alright, chop-chop, teammate.

09:20.379 --> 09:21.758
Get back to work, okay?

09:21.758 --> 09:23.413
We're losin' time
and not makin' a dime.

09:23.448 --> 09:25.379
Grey, where are you goin'?

09:25.413 --> 09:26.586
I just gotta talk to Zoey for--

09:26.620 --> 09:28.310
Look, you should've taken
care of it during lunch, okay?

09:28.379 --> 09:29.724
Instead of jerkin' off
in the bathroom?

09:29.758 --> 09:30.965
- Yeah.

09:31.034 --> 09:33.379
Oh, speaking of--
dropped your porn in there.

09:33.379 --> 09:34.724
It's not porn.

09:34.724 --> 09:35.896
Yeah, I don't care, man.

09:35.931 --> 09:37.206
I care about the environment.

09:40.827 --> 09:42.862
Come on, Zoe,
you're slower than mud.

09:42.896 --> 09:44.068
Let's go.

09:44.068 --> 09:46.068
Happy hour only lasts
till 6:00, you know?

09:46.068 --> 09:47.206
Right behind you.

09:59.241 --> 10:01.413
BARNES:
Hey.

10:01.448 --> 10:03.620
- You wanna go out Saturday?
- No.

10:03.689 --> 10:04.724
Why not?

10:04.758 --> 10:05.931
What's the problem?

10:05.965 --> 10:07.758
The fact that you don't know
why not.

10:07.793 --> 10:08.724
Bye!

10:08.724 --> 10:11.206
Is it Grey, is it?

10:14.413 --> 10:16.655
Great, well, I'm glad that
I could help you out today?

10:16.724 --> 10:18.758
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

10:20.758 --> 10:22.310
Awesome.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.413
Again, my name is Greyson.

10:24.448 --> 10:25.310
If you have any further issues,

10:25.344 --> 10:27.413
please don't hesitate
to call back.

10:27.413 --> 10:29.793
Thank you for calling--

10:29.862 --> 10:31.896
Hello, sir?

10:31.931 --> 10:34.275
Sir?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.137
- LIAM: Hey, cuz.
- Hey.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.413
LIAM:
Want a beer?

11:13.448 --> 11:15.310
Yes, please.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.931
Awesome.

11:22.965 --> 11:25.206
Oh, thank you.

11:25.275 --> 11:27.000
Don't mention it.

11:28.137 --> 11:29.931
Oh.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.689
You have to work late tonight?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.965
Nah.

11:35.965 --> 11:38.137
Actually,
took off a little early.

11:38.172 --> 11:39.862
Went shootin' with a friend
of mine.

11:39.931 --> 11:41.965
A dude named "Winslow".

11:41.965 --> 11:43.827
"Weird Winslow",
they call him at work.

11:43.862 --> 11:44.965
Hmm.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.275
He picked up
his badass machine gun,

11:46.310 --> 11:48.965
did some simple conversions
to it.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.931
The thing goes full auto now.

11:50.965 --> 11:52.034
It was crazy.

11:52.068 --> 11:54.310
A guy they call "Weird Winslow"
has a machine gun?

11:54.310 --> 11:57.034
LIAM:
Yeah.

11:57.103 --> 11:58.758
Weird Winslow
has a machine gun.

11:58.793 --> 12:00.275
Say it with me.

12:00.310 --> 12:01.862
LIAM:
Yeah, he's alright.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.103
He's just a little--

12:03.172 --> 12:05.206
Anachronistic.

12:05.206 --> 12:10.379
Um-- yeah, I don't know
what that means, but--

12:12.206 --> 12:13.448
Weird Winslow
has a machine gun.

12:13.517 --> 12:14.896
-

12:14.896 --> 12:16.551
Anyways, we're goin' again
Sunday afternoon,

12:16.586 --> 12:19.862
before I head to Janice,
if you wanna go?

12:19.896 --> 12:23.103
No, I can't, I have James.

12:23.172 --> 12:24.931
- You sure?
- Mmhmm.

12:33.034 --> 12:35.344
LIAM:
Hey, you already eat?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.862
Yeah.

12:37.896 --> 12:39.862
LIAM:
No James, tonight?

12:39.896 --> 12:43.413
No, not till Wednesday,
but then just for a little bit.

12:43.448 --> 12:46.068
- LIAM: Like usual.
- Yeah?

12:46.103 --> 12:48.034
LIAM:
Sorry, man.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.172
Me, too.

13:11.620 --> 13:15.310
Listen, hey, dude um--

13:15.344 --> 13:17.000
You know, I just wanna say...

13:20.448 --> 13:25.241
...thanks for letting me
and James stay here.

13:25.275 --> 13:26.137
As soon as I get back
on my feet, I--

13:26.172 --> 13:28.275
Nay.

13:28.310 --> 13:29.965
You're family, man.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Blood's thicker than water.

13:32.068 --> 13:34.103
You stay here as long
as you need to.

13:34.137 --> 13:36.793
Okay?

14:13.551 --> 14:16.000
James, time to get up.

14:25.551 --> 14:27.275
Buddy, come on, time to get up.

15:06.068 --> 15:08.620
- Good morning.
- Morning.

15:08.655 --> 15:12.379
Um, thank you for the latté
yesterday.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.413
I wanted to come by and say so,
but Eric's--

15:15.448 --> 15:16.275
anyway, I can give you
some money

15:16.310 --> 15:18.724
as soon as we get paid
on Thursday.

15:18.724 --> 15:19.655
Grey, if you wanna pay me back

15:19.724 --> 15:24.241
you can always buy me coffee
after work.

15:24.275 --> 15:27.965
or dinner or both.

15:30.448 --> 15:32.310
Are you asking me out?

15:32.379 --> 15:33.482
I mean, come on.

15:33.586 --> 15:37.758
I've been tryin' to get you
to ask me out for months.

15:37.793 --> 15:41.034
But you haven't quite picked up
on it.

15:41.068 --> 15:41.965
So, yeah--

15:42.689 --> 15:45.241
I'm asking.

15:45.275 --> 15:49.241
A girl's gotta take care
of herself sometime, right?

15:49.275 --> 15:52.103
I have my son on the weekends.

15:52.137 --> 15:53.586
So Thursday then?

15:53.620 --> 15:57.689
6:30 p.m., Anthem Coffee.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.379
Coffee date?

15:59.413 --> 16:01.103
Okay.

16:04.482 --> 16:06.689
This isn't a prank, is it?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.517
No, no prank.

16:10.758 --> 16:12.758
I like you, Grey.

16:12.793 --> 16:15.655
Why?

16:15.689 --> 16:17.724
It's 'cause you're different.

16:17.793 --> 16:23.448
And I need different in my life
right now, I think.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.275
Um--

16:30.413 --> 16:31.482
- Oh--
- Oh.

16:31.551 --> 16:33.137
- You should go clock in.
- Yeah, I should clock in.

16:33.137 --> 16:34.310
Yeah, um.

16:39.758 --> 16:41.137
- Grey.
- GREYSON: Yeah?

16:41.172 --> 16:42.620
Can you come in here a sec?

16:42.655 --> 16:44.275
Is everything alright?

16:44.310 --> 16:45.413
ERIC:
Yeah, just come on.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.068
Have a seat, Grey.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.344
Jen, from upstairs,
says I gotta write you up

17:01.379 --> 17:02.241
for being late the other day.

17:02.310 --> 17:03.758
Eric, it was just
a few minutes, I was--

17:03.827 --> 17:08.344
Look, I like you, Grey,
I do, okay?

17:08.379 --> 17:10.379
But the company policy
is clear.

17:10.413 --> 17:12.793
You have to be at your desk,
you have to be logged in,

17:12.862 --> 17:15.517
and be ready to take calls
by 7:00 a.m.

17:15.517 --> 17:16.551
I know.

17:16.655 --> 17:17.827
Look, I gave you a verbal
warning last time, okay?

17:17.862 --> 17:20.379
So I have to write you up
this time.

17:20.379 --> 17:21.827
It's not a big deal.

17:21.862 --> 17:24.413
It just states that
we spoke about it

17:24.448 --> 17:27.551
and that if it continues,
further action,

17:27.586 --> 17:30.206
up to and including termination,
could occur.

17:30.206 --> 17:32.241
Now, nobody wants that, Grey.

17:32.275 --> 17:34.482
Just sign there.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.206
It states that you understand
the company policies

17:37.241 --> 17:39.758
as laid out
in the employee handbook.

17:39.827 --> 17:41.620
I didn't get
an employee handbook.

17:41.689 --> 17:43.172
Well, you're tryin'
to be difficult?

17:43.206 --> 17:44.344
No.

17:44.379 --> 17:45.862
Sign then.

17:45.862 --> 17:46.724
Here.

17:46.758 --> 17:48.551
Alright.

17:48.586 --> 17:50.379
ERIC:
Alright, thanks.

17:50.379 --> 17:51.241
Yeah, I got it.

17:51.275 --> 17:52.517
That's it.

17:52.551 --> 17:54.517
- That's it?
- Yep.

17:56.758 --> 17:58.344
So it won't happen again, okay?

18:01.275 --> 18:04.620
Look, the next time,
there's a three-day suspension,

18:04.620 --> 18:08.758
and time after that is well--
you know?

18:08.793 --> 18:10.448
I understand.

18:10.482 --> 18:12.344
Good.

18:12.413 --> 18:13.551
You can go now.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.517
Hey, Grey.

18:16.586 --> 18:19.655
Why don't you smile more, huh?

18:19.724 --> 18:20.896
Yeah, there you go.

18:20.931 --> 18:21.827
Yeah.

18:25.482 --> 18:26.448
BARNES:
Once again, my name is Barnes.

18:26.448 --> 18:27.517
Thank you for callin' Tech Fix

18:27.586 --> 18:30.344
and I hope
you have a wonderful day.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.896
Grey, pick up the phone!

18:38.896 --> 18:40.413
Thank you for calling Tech Fix.

18:40.448 --> 18:41.931
This is Barnes,
how may I assist you today?

18:41.931 --> 18:42.931
Thank you for calling Tech Fix.

18:42.931 --> 18:44.655
This is Greyson.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.931
How can I help you today?

19:48.724 --> 19:50.896
:
The forecast, showers
and thunderstorms today

19:50.931 --> 19:54.586
with strong southwesterly winds
to 37 miles per hour.

19:54.655 --> 19:57.517
We'll have a high of 59 degrees
with the temperature dropping

19:57.517 --> 19:59.517
rapidly towards this evening.

19:59.551 --> 20:01.655
The showers and thunderstorm's
expected to continue

20:01.689 --> 20:03.000
until tomorrow morning.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.344
The overnight low, near 38.

20:05.379 --> 20:06.206
Rain tapering off to--

20:15.379 --> 20:17.310
Button Grey slowpoke over there.

20:17.344 --> 20:18.482
Oh yeah.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.655
Fuck Grey.

20:19.689 --> 20:21.310
BARNES:

20:25.034 --> 20:27.000
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

20:27.034 --> 20:28.379
What I'm tryin' to tell you--

20:29.310 --> 20:31.448
Yes.

20:31.482 --> 20:33.000
Okay, ma'am--

20:34.827 --> 20:36.896
Ma'am, please--

20:36.931 --> 20:39.482
Yes, what I'm-- what I'm trying
to tell you is that if-

20:39.482 --> 20:42.827
if you just-- hello?

20:42.862 --> 20:44.310
Hello?

20:58.827 --> 20:59.896
Hey.

20:59.965 --> 21:01.551
Hey.

21:01.586 --> 21:05.413
So we're still on
for tomorrow night, right?

21:05.413 --> 21:09.758
Yeah, if you still want to.

21:09.793 --> 21:12.931
Yeah, I-- I still want to.

21:12.965 --> 21:14.862
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:17.724 --> 21:19.413
I should go.

21:19.448 --> 21:20.931
I gotta go pick up James
by like 4:30, so--

21:20.965 --> 21:21.896
Yeah, no worries.

21:21.896 --> 21:25.586
I will see you tomorrow.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.551
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:27.586 --> 21:28.793
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:40.517 --> 21:42.793
Really?

21:42.862 --> 21:43.931
What?

21:43.965 --> 21:46.034
Grey.

21:46.068 --> 21:48.034
Yeah, Grey!

21:48.068 --> 21:49.793
I like him.

21:49.827 --> 21:52.379
Isn't he like-- what,
20 years older than you?

21:52.413 --> 21:53.551
No.

21:56.379 --> 21:57.275
So what?

21:57.344 --> 21:58.758
My dad's like 10 years older
than my mom

21:58.793 --> 22:01.551
and they're happy, so--

22:01.620 --> 22:04.448
Oh, doesn't he have a kid?

22:04.482 --> 22:07.620
Yeah, so?

22:07.655 --> 22:10.137
All I'm saying is be careful.

22:10.172 --> 22:11.965
Divorced, single dad,
works here--

22:11.965 --> 22:12.758
Oh.

22:12.793 --> 22:14.551
He's probably damaged goods,
Zoe.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.655
Okay, why do we say those things
about single dads,

22:16.689 --> 22:18.689
'cause like
we call single moms "brave"?

22:18.724 --> 22:21.965
"Ooh, look at her raisin'
that baby all on her own."

22:22.000 --> 22:23.137
But when it comes to single dads
we're like,

22:23.137 --> 22:24.931
"Oh, look at him,
he is a loser"

22:24.965 --> 22:26.172
and that's bullshit, Kate--

22:26.172 --> 22:27.586
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Because we don't know--

22:27.620 --> 22:28.965
Whoa!
Point made.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.379
Jeez.

22:31.448 --> 22:33.137
- All I'm saying is be careful.
- Oh.

22:33.172 --> 22:36.931
There's something a little off
about him.

22:36.965 --> 22:38.965
He's weird.

22:38.965 --> 22:41.103
- He's shy.
- Weird.

22:41.137 --> 22:42.413
Shy!

22:42.448 --> 22:44.413
Same thing.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.793
So I'm shy.

22:45.827 --> 22:47.758
Does that make me weird?

22:47.793 --> 22:49.793
Um, yeah.

22:50.758 --> 22:52.758
But I love you anyway.

22:52.793 --> 22:54.517
Come on happy hour calls.

22:54.586 --> 22:55.482
Oh my God!

23:04.586 --> 23:05.689
Daddy!

23:12.034 --> 23:12.896
Hey, bud.

23:15.206 --> 23:16.206
How was daycare today?

23:16.241 --> 23:17.862
You know, what we did today?

23:17.896 --> 23:19.517
What'd you do today?

23:19.551 --> 23:21.689
We painted pictures
with our fingers.

23:21.724 --> 23:23.758
Really?

23:23.827 --> 23:24.827
Can I see?

23:28.758 --> 23:29.862
Hey.

23:29.862 --> 23:31.931
Had them finger-paint outside.

23:36.862 --> 23:38.206
GREYSON:
Wow!

23:38.241 --> 23:41.103
This is very good.

23:41.172 --> 23:43.206
You did this all by yourself?

23:43.206 --> 23:44.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:45.034 --> 23:47.206
This is very pretty, son,
you did a good job.

23:47.241 --> 23:48.689
Is this for me?

23:48.724 --> 23:52.206
No, for mommy.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.551
I'm sure she'll love it.

23:54.586 --> 23:56.896
JAMES:
I made you, too.

23:56.931 --> 23:59.000
I put "to dad" on it,

23:59.034 --> 24:01.448
so you would know
which one's yours.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.827
That's great.

24:05.862 --> 24:09.758
I think we should go home
and hang it right up.

24:09.758 --> 24:12.586
Come on.

24:12.586 --> 24:14.931
Uh, this is his stuff.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.586
Oh yeah.

24:16.586 --> 24:18.000
Hold your bag.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.758
And Marilyn wanted me
to remind you

24:19.758 --> 24:22.103
it's your week to pay.

24:22.137 --> 24:25.620
I get paid on Thursday, though,
so I don't--

24:25.620 --> 24:27.862
I don't have it at the moment,

24:27.931 --> 24:29.793
but I can give it to you
right after they send it.

24:29.827 --> 24:31.068
That's fine.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.103
Thank you.

24:32.137 --> 24:32.655
Alright, let's go.

24:32.724 --> 24:34.000
See you tomorrow, James.

24:34.068 --> 24:35.241
- JAMES: Bye.
- Bye.

24:35.275 --> 24:37.137
- Thank you.
- Sure.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.172
One kid scoop
of birthday cake ice, please.

24:45.241 --> 24:46.896
Okay, is that a cup or a cone?

24:46.931 --> 24:47.896
How much more is the cone?

24:47.931 --> 24:50.586
It's 30c.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.827
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:58.241 --> 24:59.586
Here you go.

25:01.827 --> 25:05.000
Okay, it's a buck, 45.

25:05.034 --> 25:06.620
Thank you.

25:08.655 --> 25:09.793
There you go.

25:11.241 --> 25:13.172
Uh, you said it was a buck, 45.

25:13.172 --> 25:15.137
SHOPKEEPER:
Yeah, sorry,
I only have pennies.

25:15.172 --> 25:16.758
- That's fine.
- Okay.

25:16.827 --> 25:19.758
JAMES:
We're savin' up our change
to go to Disneyland.

25:19.827 --> 25:22.724
We put it in a jar at home,
and when it's full,

25:22.793 --> 25:24.034
we're goin' to Disneyland.

25:24.068 --> 25:26.758
Oh, I don't think 5 pennies
is gonna get you very far, kid.

25:26.827 --> 25:29.068
JAMES:
Daddy says, "When you workin'
towards somethin'

25:29.137 --> 25:30.172
every penny matters".

25:30.206 --> 25:31.551
That's right, son.

25:31.620 --> 25:33.137
Yeah, every penny matters.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.275
There you go.

25:44.379 --> 25:45.482
You want a bite, daddy?

25:45.517 --> 25:47.655
No, that's all you, dude,
but you have to promise me

25:47.689 --> 25:49.344
you're gonna eat some dinner
tonight, okay?

25:49.344 --> 25:50.655
Okay, what's for dinner?

25:56.344 --> 25:58.206
Dad, can you help me?

25:58.241 --> 25:59.724
Sure thing, buddy,
just a minute.

26:20.758 --> 26:22.137
Oh, you're gonna give him
purple stripes?

26:22.206 --> 26:23.793
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's cool.

26:23.862 --> 26:24.896
That's a good idea.

26:28.896 --> 26:31.689
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.689
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:32.724 --> 26:33.413
What else does it need?

26:33.448 --> 26:37.137
- Anything?
- Mmm.

26:37.206 --> 26:39.103
- I think it's pretty good.
- Yeah.

26:39.137 --> 26:41.034
Yeah, that looks like birthday
cake ice cream, right?

26:41.068 --> 26:43.103
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

26:44.448 --> 26:46.310
I'll just shade it
in a little bit more.

27:01.379 --> 27:02.965
MARILYN:
I thought I heard you.

27:02.965 --> 27:06.310
Oh my gosh, that's amazing!

27:06.344 --> 27:07.793
I did it myself.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.344
Is that me
with the blonde hair?

27:09.379 --> 27:11.137
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love it.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.448
Thank you so much, sweetie.

27:13.482 --> 27:15.793
- You're late.
- I know.

27:15.793 --> 27:18.172
We were workin' on our book.

27:18.206 --> 27:21.275
So is your mother just gonna
let you have her car?

27:21.310 --> 27:22.689
Yeah, she said I could keep it.

27:24.034 --> 27:24.931
Good for you, Grey.

27:24.965 --> 27:27.344
What am I supposed to do,
tell her "no"?

27:27.379 --> 27:31.793
Hmm, somebody always comes
to your rescue, don't they?

27:31.827 --> 27:34.034
Hey, go on inside, mister,
dinner's about ready.

27:34.103 --> 27:35.965
- JAMES: We ate.
- Oh.

27:35.965 --> 27:37.448
What'd you eat?

27:37.482 --> 27:39.275
Daddy's scrambled eggs.

27:39.310 --> 27:40.482
Okay.

27:40.517 --> 27:41.448
You need some real food.

27:41.482 --> 27:43.103
Go on in.

27:43.137 --> 27:44.931
Here, take this painting.

27:44.965 --> 27:46.862
Thank you.

27:48.137 --> 27:50.379
He needs more than eggs
for dinner.

27:50.448 --> 27:51.586
GREYSON:
I know.

27:51.655 --> 27:53.448
I'm gonna go buy some fruit
and stuff for this weekend

27:53.482 --> 27:55.034
after I get paid.

27:55.103 --> 27:55.965
Yeah, about that--

27:58.379 --> 28:00.482
What's up, mister?

28:00.517 --> 28:02.103
I forgot to say "bye" to dad.

28:02.172 --> 28:04.827
- Can I?
- Of course.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.862
I'll see you this weekend, okay?

28:09.896 --> 28:11.172
Alright, go back inside.

28:16.586 --> 28:19.275
So what were you gonna say?

28:19.344 --> 28:20.241
Nothing.

28:20.241 --> 28:22.379
Just have a good weekend
with him, okay?

28:41.344 --> 28:43.034
GREYSON:
Shit.

28:54.896 --> 28:56.310
Hey, Grey.

28:56.344 --> 28:57.482
Hey.

28:57.517 --> 28:59.068
No gym today?

28:59.103 --> 29:00.931
Uh...

29:00.965 --> 29:03.103
No, my free trial expired.

29:03.137 --> 29:04.586
- Lame.
- Yeah.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.931
Oh, hey, this is Winslow.

29:06.931 --> 29:09.275
Winslow Danny,
meet Greyson Bell.

29:09.310 --> 29:10.448
It's nice to meet you Mr. Bell.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.137
Hi.

29:11.172 --> 29:13.241
What's with the machine gun?

29:14.931 --> 29:15.931
Well, this is what
those cream puffs

29:15.965 --> 29:19.275
would call an "assault rifle".

29:19.275 --> 29:20.413
Winslow was just showin' me
the conversion work

29:20.413 --> 29:21.896
he did on it.

29:21.931 --> 29:23.448
- Did all the work himself.
- Hmm.

29:23.482 --> 29:26.896
I'm thinkin' about buying it
from him.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.000
WINSLOW:
You shoot, Mr. Bell?

29:29.068 --> 29:32.103
By shootin' I mean you ever
fire a weapon.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.275
Not in anger, though.

29:34.310 --> 29:38.448
No one should ever fire
a weapon in anger.

29:38.482 --> 29:40.310
You can just call me "Grey",
but-- no,

29:40.344 --> 29:44.931
I mean I don't even know
which end to-

29:44.931 --> 29:46.103
I know which end, I'm j-

29:46.137 --> 29:47.620
I'm just sayin' like no,
I wouldn't.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.448
Well, then, sir,
would you like to learn,

29:50.448 --> 29:55.068
because I am in fact
a certified safety instructor

29:55.103 --> 29:58.172
and licensed dealer
for that matter.

29:58.241 --> 30:01.517
Liam and I, we're goin' out
shooting Sunday after work.

30:01.586 --> 30:03.413
You know, it'd be a pleasure
to have you come join us

30:03.448 --> 30:06.137
in celebratin'
our Second Amendment rights,

30:06.172 --> 30:09.586
in true red-blooded
American fashion I might add.

30:09.586 --> 30:10.793
Yeah, absolutely.

30:10.793 --> 30:13.241
You guys are gonna celebrate
by shooting a machine gun?

30:13.275 --> 30:14.586
Yeah.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.517
I own several of 'em.

30:16.586 --> 30:21.103
It's our God-given right.

30:21.137 --> 30:23.965
I have a kid, so I can't--
I can't do it you know.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.620
Well, there you go.

30:25.655 --> 30:28.344
That's an even better reason
to learn.

30:28.413 --> 30:31.620
Gun safety is important
if you have children.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.413
Picture the scenario,
your kid finds a gun.

30:34.448 --> 30:37.103
Thinks it's a toy.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.172
Can you imagine
the consequences

30:38.241 --> 30:41.275
of somethin' like that
happenin'?

30:41.310 --> 30:44.448
Downright unthinkable.

30:44.448 --> 30:46.172
Here, check this out.

30:46.206 --> 30:49.448
- Whoa, oh, no, no, I can't.
- It's alright, safety's on.

30:49.482 --> 30:50.620
Just don't put your finger
on the trigger,

30:50.655 --> 30:52.931
- it's uh, right there.
- Okay.

30:52.931 --> 30:55.275
It's alright,
ain't gonna bite you.

30:55.275 --> 30:56.310
Alright.

30:58.241 --> 30:59.275
Whoa, Jesus Christ!

30:59.344 --> 31:00.000
Oh, s-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.689
- Dude, I'm sorry.
- Listen.

31:02.724 --> 31:06.068
You never ever point a gun
at somethin'

31:06.137 --> 31:07.689
you don't intend to kill.

31:07.724 --> 31:11.482
You understand what I'm sayin',
Mr. Bell?

31:11.517 --> 31:12.551
GREYSON:
I'm sorry.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.965
Well, I'm just sayin'
if you remember anything,

31:14.000 --> 31:15.482
remember that.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.379
Gun's not a toy.

31:17.413 --> 31:19.379
It should be treated
with respect.

31:19.448 --> 31:20.379
I got it.

31:20.448 --> 31:21.655
Jesus.

31:21.689 --> 31:25.413
Well, I believe you, but here.

31:25.482 --> 31:26.896
- The safety's right here--
- No.

31:26.965 --> 31:29.034
And you just make sure
that sucker's on first.

31:29.068 --> 31:30.241
No, I shouldn't.

31:30.310 --> 31:31.344
That's alright.

31:31.344 --> 31:33.379
Here, take it.

31:35.034 --> 31:37.000
No, we don't--
you just hold it right there.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.413
Alright.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.172
Now, listen,
when you pull the trigger,

31:42.172 --> 31:44.310
this thing is gonna kick back
at you.

31:44.344 --> 31:46.551
That's gonna cause the barrel
to climb,

31:46.586 --> 31:48.482
so you have to kinda just--

31:48.482 --> 31:51.000
Here, there you go.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.517
Just like that.

31:54.551 --> 31:56.241
Feels good, doesn't it?

31:56.310 --> 32:00.034
Ugh, no, I-- here.

32:00.068 --> 32:01.517
I'm never gonna shoot
anything like that.

32:01.551 --> 32:02.758
Yeah, I understand.

32:02.793 --> 32:05.586
A gun that size
can be intimidating.

32:05.586 --> 32:06.620
Kinda like the young
college girl

32:06.655 --> 32:08.137
havin' her first sex encounter.

32:09.551 --> 32:10.551
She's really kinda hopin'
she gets somethin'

32:10.551 --> 32:11.551
she can handle.

32:13.241 --> 32:14.724
If you catch my drift.

32:14.758 --> 32:15.724
Yeah.

32:18.413 --> 32:19.551
WINSLOW:
I won't hold it against you.

32:20.344 --> 32:22.068
LIAM:
Hey, you want a beer?

32:22.068 --> 32:24.068
Yeah.

32:24.103 --> 32:28.310
Hey, somethin' American
and/or domestic, please.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.620
LIAM:
Yeah.

32:30.655 --> 32:33.620
How about we start
with somethin' small.

32:33.689 --> 32:35.551
That's small?

32:35.551 --> 32:37.517
Comparatively, yes, sir.

32:37.551 --> 32:40.310
It's a revolver, simple.

32:40.379 --> 32:43.103
Just point and pull the trigger.

32:43.137 --> 32:45.724
Kinda like a dart gun.

32:45.758 --> 32:47.724
You know, those little kid toys
with a plastic dart

32:47.724 --> 32:49.413
and a suction cup on the end?

32:49.413 --> 32:50.586
Kind I used to shoot
my little brother

32:50.586 --> 32:52.379
in the forehead
with all the time.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.241
Did you ever have
one of those dart guns

32:56.241 --> 32:59.034
when you're a kid, Mr. Bell?

32:59.068 --> 33:00.137
GREYSON:
Yeah, sure.

33:00.206 --> 33:02.103
Everybody did.

33:02.137 --> 33:04.655
I do believe you are correct,
sir.

33:04.689 --> 33:07.655
I reckon about every boy did.

33:07.655 --> 33:10.103
Well, this ain't that
much different than those,

33:10.137 --> 33:11.655
really.

33:11.689 --> 33:14.620
Although,
this shoots real bullets

33:14.655 --> 33:17.689
instead of a plastic little dart
with a suction cup on the end,

33:17.724 --> 33:21.586
which is considerably
less dangerous.

33:24.620 --> 33:26.448
And this is quite
a bit heavier, too.

33:30.275 --> 33:32.103
Is this thing loaded?

33:32.137 --> 33:36.034
That is not, but this one is.

33:36.103 --> 33:37.724
A man must be prepared
to defend himself

33:37.793 --> 33:41.517
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

33:41.551 --> 33:44.482
You just point
and pull the trigger,

33:44.482 --> 33:48.448
and you got a dead body
on the other end.

33:48.482 --> 33:51.137
Simple and neat, as you please.

33:51.137 --> 33:52.620
I don't wanna shoot anybody.

33:54.448 --> 33:57.310
Pacifist.

33:57.310 --> 33:59.517
I get that.

33:59.551 --> 34:03.241
Path of least resistance
is a tough one to walk sometimes

34:03.275 --> 34:07.206
and deserves its own respect
for the difficulties therein.

34:07.241 --> 34:11.413
Not everyone's a warrior,
Mr. Bell.

34:11.448 --> 34:13.379
I accept you for who you are.

34:13.413 --> 34:15.551
Why don't you come with us
this weekend, Grey?

34:15.551 --> 34:17.862
We'll be shootin' cans
and stuff, it's fun.

34:17.862 --> 34:18.862
GREYSON:
Shooting cans?

34:18.862 --> 34:20.551
Yeah.

34:20.586 --> 34:22.827
Yes, sir, Mr. Bell.

34:22.862 --> 34:27.103
Mexicans, Africans,
Puerto Ricans.

34:29.172 --> 34:31.896
It's not even
a little bit funny.

34:31.931 --> 34:34.862
I'm sorry, I was just jokin',
Mr. Bell.

34:38.931 --> 34:40.758
Fact is we've got
a serious immigrant problem

34:40.793 --> 34:45.206
in this country anyways
and it should be dealt with.

34:45.206 --> 34:47.413
I'm not sayin'
I advocate shootin' anyone.

34:47.448 --> 34:50.448
Well, that would be just wrong.

34:50.517 --> 34:52.206
They oughta just pass
some legislation

34:52.206 --> 34:54.758
to keep 'em out
in the first place.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.793
Build a friggin' wall
or somethin'.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.931
Dude, can I borrow
a couple bucks for gas

35:00.931 --> 35:02.275
to get to work tomorrow?

35:02.310 --> 35:04.413
I can pay you back as soon
as I get home.

35:04.448 --> 35:06.448
I'm all tapped out till Friday,
man.

35:06.482 --> 35:09.517
- Sorry.
- Shit.

35:09.586 --> 35:12.827
I could arrange a small loan
for you.

35:12.896 --> 35:14.448
Or I could just give you
five bucks

35:14.482 --> 35:17.413
of my hard-earned money.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.724
If takin' a handout would suit
your democratic mindset

35:19.758 --> 35:21.586
a little better.

35:24.758 --> 35:27.172
Hey, don't say shit like that
around here, okay?

35:27.241 --> 35:28.586
Grey's dealin'
with a lot of shit

35:28.586 --> 35:30.344
and he's family.

35:30.413 --> 35:31.586
Money's tight, that's all.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.241
Shit, Liam, I was just joking.

35:33.275 --> 35:36.586
I know that, but he doesn't.

35:36.620 --> 35:39.896
- Just give him a break.
- You're right, of course.

35:39.931 --> 35:42.758
So I go forth and apologize?

35:42.793 --> 35:44.275
No.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.448
Just-- here.

35:47.448 --> 35:48.793
Let me see that 9.

35:48.827 --> 35:50.551
You really carry that thing
around loaded?

35:52.241 --> 35:53.551
I do indeed.

36:35.551 --> 36:36.620
Fuck!

37:41.517 --> 37:42.862
Pump 2.

37:42.896 --> 37:44.275
Really?

38:34.793 --> 38:36.655
Good morning.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.482
Morning.

38:40.965 --> 38:41.482
I gotta--

38:41.551 --> 38:44.344
Yeah, go get to work.

38:53.137 --> 38:56.655
Yes, and if it does happen
again um, please call back,

38:56.655 --> 38:57.655
and you have
my direct extension,

38:57.689 --> 39:01.103
and we can take care of it.

39:01.172 --> 39:01.689
Okay, great.

39:01.724 --> 39:04.034
Yes.

39:04.034 --> 39:04.931
Oh, again, my name is Greyson,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.068
thank you so much
for calling Tech Fix,

39:07.103 --> 39:10.103
and have a great rest
of your night.

39:10.172 --> 39:11.551
Okay, you too.

39:26.689 --> 39:28.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:28.206 --> 39:29.206
Change your mind yet?

39:29.241 --> 39:30.551
Nope.

39:30.586 --> 39:33.000
- You?
- Nope.

39:33.034 --> 39:35.758
So what's the plan?

39:35.827 --> 39:37.862
I just gotta go cash
my paycheck,

39:37.862 --> 39:38.862
and run a few errands,

39:38.896 --> 39:41.517
and then I'm gonna go home,
and get ready.

39:41.551 --> 39:44.586
Do you wanna go out to dinner
or somethin' after coffee?

39:44.655 --> 39:46.172
Yeah, I would like that.

39:46.206 --> 39:48.172
- Yes, um--
- Okay.

39:48.206 --> 39:50.172
Okay.

39:50.206 --> 39:51.862
- I should go.
- Uh, yeah.

39:51.862 --> 39:55.000
I will see you in an hour?

39:55.034 --> 39:57.413
- 6:30, yeah.
- 6:30.

39:59.827 --> 40:01.103
- Okay.
- Alright, see you.

40:01.172 --> 40:04.068
See you in an hour.

40:07.241 --> 40:08.517
GREYSON:
Fuck.

40:55.034 --> 40:56.000
Hey.

40:56.034 --> 40:58.724
Hey.

40:58.758 --> 40:59.758
You showed up.

40:59.827 --> 41:01.758
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.793
I was starting to think that
you wouldn't.

41:05.827 --> 41:08.758
Oh, no, I just--

41:08.793 --> 41:09.620
I didn't know what to wear.

41:12.793 --> 41:14.448
Well, I mean you look great.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.620
Thanks.

41:17.655 --> 41:20.103
Just you know,
it's been a long time

41:20.137 --> 41:22.931
since I've been on a date
with the work, and the kid,

41:22.965 --> 41:26.068
and you know,
you look great, too.

41:27.793 --> 41:28.931
Buy me coffee, Grey.

41:28.931 --> 41:30.551
Alright.

41:32.586 --> 41:34.931
Alright, the big question.

41:34.965 --> 41:36.551
Uh-oh.

41:36.586 --> 41:38.068
It's just a question.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.068
Alright, go ahead.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.068
What do you keep workin' on
in the break room?

41:45.103 --> 41:46.586
What's in that sketchbook?

41:46.620 --> 41:49.931
Oh, it's--

41:49.965 --> 41:52.103
It's just somethin'
I'm workin' on with my son.

41:52.103 --> 41:54.586
- Aw!
- Hey, guys.

41:54.620 --> 41:55.689
- How are you two, today?
- Good.

41:55.758 --> 41:57.068
- Oh, good, thank you.
- Good.

41:57.103 --> 41:58.931
Can I get you guys started
with anything to drink?

41:58.965 --> 42:01.172
Um, may I please have
a 12 ounce vanilla latté?

42:01.172 --> 42:02.724
Sounds good.

42:02.758 --> 42:05.827
- For you?
- Um, can I get a tea anything?

42:05.827 --> 42:07.275
Like a London Fog?

42:07.310 --> 42:08.551
Okay.

42:08.620 --> 42:09.551
- Alright.
- Thank you.

42:09.620 --> 42:10.310
You'll like it.

42:10.310 --> 42:11.310
Okay.

42:11.344 --> 42:12.137
I don't know what that is.

42:15.310 --> 42:18.655
Okay, so?

42:18.655 --> 42:20.241
So--

42:20.310 --> 42:21.655
It's a book.

42:21.689 --> 42:23.172
What kind of book?

42:23.172 --> 42:25.724
It's nothing.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.758
What?

42:27.827 --> 42:35.310
It's just I never really shared
with anyone and...

42:35.344 --> 42:37.689
...no one's ever asked me
about it before actually.

42:37.724 --> 42:39.206
Well, I mean I'm asking.

42:42.137 --> 42:43.827
Okay.

42:43.827 --> 42:45.896
Okay.

42:45.931 --> 42:48.655
It'll probably be easier
if I just showed you though.

42:48.689 --> 42:50.517
Yeah, okay.

42:53.793 --> 42:55.172
What?

42:55.172 --> 42:55.793
Where are you--

42:55.827 --> 42:58.655
Just-- I'll be one second.

42:58.689 --> 43:00.172
Alright, here are your drinks.

43:00.172 --> 43:01.758
Oh, thank you.

43:03.862 --> 43:05.000
Thanks.

43:47.793 --> 43:49.034
So?

43:50.241 --> 43:52.206
This is really personal.

43:54.862 --> 43:56.206
Okay.

43:57.413 --> 43:59.103
Yeah, it's just me and my son,

43:59.137 --> 44:02.310
we really put a lot of work
into this, and normally,

44:02.344 --> 44:04.758
I would never share this
with anyone.

44:04.793 --> 44:06.827
Grey, you said that already.

44:06.862 --> 44:09.482
I'm not gonna tell anyone,
I promise.

44:09.482 --> 44:11.965
These are all originals
and they can't be replaced,

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
so I'm trusting you.

44:16.034 --> 44:17.793
ZOEY:
Grey.

44:17.827 --> 44:19.310
Okay, okay.

44:43.206 --> 44:46.206
These are really good, Grey.

44:46.275 --> 44:47.448
Really.

44:57.103 --> 44:59.724
Have you always been an artist?

44:59.793 --> 45:03.241
It's the only thing
I ever wanted to be.

45:03.275 --> 45:05.413
I've been drawing
ever since I was a kid.

45:05.482 --> 45:07.275
Hmm.

45:07.344 --> 45:10.448
Even went to a pretty good
art school, got a degree,

45:10.517 --> 45:14.758
started my own business,
you know, but--

45:18.551 --> 45:20.241
But?

45:20.275 --> 45:24.862
But then James came along.

45:24.862 --> 45:26.068
We just--

45:26.103 --> 45:31.793
We were not ready at all,
we-- we were totally not ready.

45:31.862 --> 45:35.827
And you know,
I had to look for a real job,

45:35.862 --> 45:37.862
somethin' with insurance.

45:41.034 --> 45:43.551
Had to sell our supplies,
and all my paintings,

45:43.551 --> 45:47.206
and stuff to buy diapers.

45:47.206 --> 45:48.896
Turns out that
an art school degree

45:48.896 --> 45:53.206
doesn't really translate
to the real world.

45:53.241 --> 45:56.344
Before we knew it,
went underwater

45:56.379 --> 45:59.241
and lost everything.

46:02.310 --> 46:06.000
And now you work at Tech Fix?

46:06.068 --> 46:08.103
Yeah.

46:08.137 --> 46:10.103
Now, I work at Tech Fix.

46:10.137 --> 46:13.103
They were hirin'
and I just needed a new job.

46:13.103 --> 46:14.827
What's it about?

46:17.482 --> 46:23.310
It's called "The Bumbling Ogre"
and it's about a little boy

46:23.344 --> 46:27.344
who doesn't have any friends
or at least,

46:27.413 --> 46:29.448
he thinks he doesn't have
any real friends,

46:29.448 --> 46:32.931
because they're always playing
on their phones

46:32.965 --> 46:35.000
and on their computer,
and he wants to go out

46:35.068 --> 46:36.862
and play in the woods.

46:36.931 --> 46:40.275
And he wants to explore
and have adventures.

46:40.310 --> 46:42.275
His mom works all the time
and she's never home.

46:42.275 --> 46:45.931
So one day he's all by himself
and he decides,

46:45.931 --> 46:48.241
"I'm gonna head out
in the woods and play".

46:48.275 --> 46:49.586
So he does.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.586
But the woods are dark, scary,

46:52.620 --> 46:54.586
and way bigger
than he imagined,

46:54.620 --> 46:58.482
so he finds himself lost,
and then it starts raining.

46:58.517 --> 47:00.517
So the little boy sees a cave
and he thinks,

47:00.586 --> 47:04.172
"I'm gonna go into the cave
and wait until the rain stops."

47:04.172 --> 47:06.068
But as he gets closer
and closer,

47:06.137 --> 47:09.034
he hears a terrible roar.

47:09.068 --> 47:11.172
And he gets scared.

47:11.206 --> 47:14.000
But then an ogre
sticks his head out

47:14.000 --> 47:16.034
and he sees the boy,
and he says,

47:16.068 --> 47:19.344
"I wasn't roaring,
I was snoring."

47:21.068 --> 47:22.655
GREYSON:
And he tells the boy
he can come in

47:22.689 --> 47:25.965
and take shelter in the cave
until the rain stops,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.689
because he knows what it's like.

47:29.724 --> 47:35.344
You see,
there once was a dark wizard

47:35.344 --> 47:40.310
who told the ogre to do
bad things and he did them.

47:43.310 --> 47:48.379
And he's sorry
and now he's an outcast,

47:48.413 --> 47:53.517
so he understands
what the boy feels like and--

47:53.517 --> 47:56.137
and he wants to fix it.

47:56.172 --> 48:01.000
So the two of them sit
in his cave around a campfire

48:01.034 --> 48:05.275
and they-- they eat marshmallows
from the boy's backpack

48:05.310 --> 48:07.137
and little by little,

48:07.206 --> 48:09.620
that boy is less
and less afraid.

48:09.655 --> 48:12.620
When the rain stops,
and they go outside,

48:12.655 --> 48:15.379
and the woods seem less dark,
and less scary,

48:15.413 --> 48:19.448
because the boy
has a real friend now.

48:19.482 --> 48:24.103
And the boy asks--
he asked the ogre

48:24.137 --> 48:27.551
if he wants to play,
and they smile at each other,

48:27.586 --> 48:32.068
and the ogre,
after all that time bein' alone

48:32.068 --> 48:35.103
in his sad cave
as nobody understands him

48:35.137 --> 48:38.068
and he's an outcast,
he's so happy to have a friend

48:38.103 --> 48:40.413
and someone to play with,
he runs out into the woods,

48:40.448 --> 48:41.965
and the two play, and play,
and play,

48:42.034 --> 48:43.965
and have a-- a grand old time.

48:46.620 --> 48:52.310
And then night comes
and the boy asked the ogre

48:52.379 --> 48:54.241
if he can stay.

48:54.275 --> 49:01.000
And the ogre knows that
the boy's mother will be worried

49:01.068 --> 49:03.689
and that the dark wizard
could come back at any time,

49:03.724 --> 49:07.482
so he tells the boy
that he has to go home.

49:07.482 --> 49:11.758
And the boy, he cries,
and cries, and cries,

49:11.793 --> 49:14.103
because he thinks

49:14.137 --> 49:15.344
he's never gonna see
the ogre again,

49:15.379 --> 49:17.586
but the ogre tells him
he'll always be there

49:17.620 --> 49:19.137
when he needs him

49:19.172 --> 49:24.310
and he will always be
his friend.

49:24.344 --> 49:29.275
In the end, the boy convinces
the ogre to go live with him,

49:29.310 --> 49:33.172
so they journey together
through the woods

49:33.206 --> 49:34.482
towards the boy's house,

49:34.482 --> 49:36.137
leaving behind
the wizard's voice,

49:36.137 --> 49:38.344
and leaving behind
the ogre's dark cave,

49:38.379 --> 49:40.620
and the boy hides him
in his closet,

49:40.655 --> 49:45.068
and they have many grand
adventures together, but...

49:49.586 --> 49:51.068
...the ogre's clumsy.

49:54.310 --> 49:59.137
He's always breakin' things
and screwing things up.

49:59.172 --> 50:00.379
Even though he tries so hard

50:00.448 --> 50:02.620
and it makes him feel
really bad, but--

50:06.344 --> 50:08.689
But the boy loves him anyway.

50:11.137 --> 50:15.413
And the boy teaches him
that that's what love is.

50:16.827 --> 50:21.689
It's to accept someone
for who they are,

50:21.724 --> 50:26.034
and he helps them
to finally break the spell,

50:26.103 --> 50:28.517
and they leave the dark wizard
behind forever.

50:32.310 --> 50:35.172
And the two live happily
ever after.

50:35.206 --> 50:39.793
Uh, the boy
and the bumbling ogre.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.482
You're not an ogre, Grey.

50:52.448 --> 50:54.034
I know.

50:55.655 --> 50:59.310
Just a story,
it's a kid's book.

50:59.344 --> 51:03.103
But duh, the wizard's real.

51:07.241 --> 51:13.344
It's a great story,
and the artwork is amazing,

51:13.379 --> 51:19.413
and the moral is important,
and um--

51:23.206 --> 51:25.689
I bet you're a really great dad.

51:28.827 --> 51:30.758
My ex-wife doesn't think so.

51:34.482 --> 51:35.689
What?

51:35.724 --> 51:37.344
Dinner.

51:37.379 --> 51:39.172
I'm hungry.

51:39.206 --> 51:40.689
Everybody else seemed
to actually like,

51:40.724 --> 51:43.413
"No", like they were following
along with the events.

51:43.448 --> 51:45.172
They knew
it was a used cough drop--

51:45.206 --> 51:46.068
Mmhmm.

51:46.068 --> 51:48.241
He had smacked
out of his mouth, um--

51:49.517 --> 51:51.724
Except for me, 'cause like
when I hear like noises goin'

51:51.758 --> 51:54.448
I tend to just like you know,
move my--

52:07.241 --> 52:08.758
Is that me?

52:14.413 --> 52:15.413
Good morning.

52:15.448 --> 52:17.586
Good morning.

52:24.482 --> 52:26.827
So we probably shouldn't go
to work together.

52:27.931 --> 52:29.517
Yeah.

52:29.586 --> 52:31.896
We've already talked too much.

52:31.931 --> 52:33.827
Yeah.

52:38.655 --> 52:41.758
Do you wanna drive me back
to my car?

52:41.758 --> 52:43.448
- Okay.
-

52:43.448 --> 52:45.275
- Alright.
-

52:45.310 --> 52:46.931
Let's go.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
I had a great time last night,
really.

53:12.034 --> 53:13.000
Me, too.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Okay.

53:17.034 --> 53:18.482
Oh.

53:28.827 --> 53:30.724
We should do this again
sometime.

53:30.793 --> 53:32.344
Yeah, I'd like that.

53:34.517 --> 53:39.344
Just um, don't tell anyone
at work about this, please.

53:41.655 --> 53:44.000
- You're embarrassed?
- No!

53:44.000 --> 53:46.655
It's just--

53:46.689 --> 53:48.034
I don't want people talking
about it.

53:48.068 --> 53:51.517
I don't want either of us
to get in trouble and--

53:51.517 --> 53:53.551
- People are already talking.
- Hmm.

53:53.586 --> 53:54.551
You know, office gossip, it's--

53:54.620 --> 53:56.689
Okay.

53:56.724 --> 53:57.827
What?

53:57.827 --> 54:00.310
I said, "Okay".

54:00.344 --> 54:02.517
Don't okay me on this.

54:02.551 --> 54:03.724
I mean it.

54:09.068 --> 54:10.586
GREYSON:
Zoey!

54:10.620 --> 54:12.551
Do you regret it?

54:12.551 --> 54:14.551
No.

54:14.586 --> 54:15.758
Neither do I.

54:15.793 --> 54:18.689
So let's just go to work
like normal.

54:22.482 --> 54:23.965
What kind of a router
are you currently using

54:24.034 --> 54:26.379
right now?

54:28.379 --> 54:30.517
Good morning.

54:30.551 --> 54:32.862
Good morning.

54:32.896 --> 54:34.482
Go clock in.

54:34.551 --> 54:36.517
- Yeah, I should--
- Yeah.

54:37.896 --> 54:40.689
Oh.

54:40.724 --> 54:41.896
I think you dropped this.

54:41.896 --> 54:44.896
Thanks.

54:46.689 --> 54:47.689
Morning, Kate.

54:47.724 --> 54:48.724
Hmm.

54:51.551 --> 54:52.965
Hmm?

54:53.034 --> 54:54.793
- What?
- Nothing.

54:59.068 --> 55:01.137
- Keep up.
- Yeah, it's over.

55:01.137 --> 55:02.448
- Anyways--
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.

55:02.482 --> 55:03.655
I'm sorry about, man,
I am so sorry.

55:03.655 --> 55:04.793
Mmhmm, I don't know
to be honest,

55:04.827 --> 55:07.448
but here's what we'll do.

55:07.482 --> 55:08.655
- Here's what we'll do--
- Why don't we--

55:08.689 --> 55:10.724
-

55:10.793 --> 55:14.000
Why don't we start over again
and let's just-

55:14.034 --> 55:15.068
let's just take--

55:21.000 --> 55:23.620
So?

55:23.620 --> 55:26.482
Yeah, you, Grey.

55:26.482 --> 55:27.793
- What?
- She suck your dick?

55:29.482 --> 55:32.103
- What?
- Zoey.

55:32.137 --> 55:34.965
- The office slut.
- Don't call her that.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.689
We went out, and we had coffee,
and-- and dinner,

55:38.724 --> 55:40.793
- we had a nice time.
- It was nice.

55:40.827 --> 55:41.827
What's your problem?

55:41.862 --> 55:43.689
You weren't her first, Grey.

55:43.758 --> 55:45.827
I already tapped that shit.

55:45.862 --> 55:47.517
- You're lying.
- Am I?

55:52.965 --> 55:55.482
She was mine first, Grey.

55:55.482 --> 55:59.000
Think about that next time
you kiss her, bitch.

56:06.827 --> 56:08.862
Hey.

56:08.862 --> 56:09.793
Hey yourself.

56:09.862 --> 56:11.724
I'd like to see you after work
on Monday.

56:11.724 --> 56:13.103
Maybe we can get ice cream
or something?

56:13.172 --> 56:14.896
Yeah, ice cream.

56:17.517 --> 56:18.862
I like ice cream.

56:18.862 --> 56:20.586
Good.

56:20.620 --> 56:23.689
- It's a date.
- Okay.

56:23.724 --> 56:24.758
Monday.

56:26.586 --> 56:30.103
Hey, Grey, you know,
you can text me, right?

56:30.172 --> 56:32.586
Like over the weekend.

56:42.551 --> 56:45.965
I don't care what people say.

56:46.034 --> 56:47.689
Yeah, now, it's not really
the time or the place--

56:47.724 --> 56:51.551
Well, I just want you to know
I don't care.

56:55.793 --> 56:58.000
I'm tired of caring
what people think.

57:01.172 --> 57:02.620
You look pretty today.

57:02.655 --> 57:05.137
Thank you.

57:05.172 --> 57:06.482
Bye.

57:20.931 --> 57:21.965
I'm here, I'm here.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.137
I'm sorry I'm late, I'm sorry.

57:24.172 --> 57:25.172
Hey.

57:26.586 --> 57:28.000
I'm here.

57:28.793 --> 57:29.931
SARAH:
James stayed home today.

57:29.931 --> 57:31.896
Didn't you get Marilyn's text?

57:36.931 --> 57:39.551
Sorry.

57:39.586 --> 57:40.896
Oh.

57:40.931 --> 57:43.586
Yeah, here it is.

57:43.620 --> 57:45.206
I must've just not seen it.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.827
Okay, uh, bye.

58:03.965 --> 58:06.551
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fucker, fucker!

58:16.275 --> 58:17.275
Hello?

58:34.620 --> 58:36.896
- Mom?
- Grey.

58:36.965 --> 58:38.586
GREYSON:
What are you doing here?

58:38.655 --> 58:39.689
I thought
I'd come see my grandson--

58:39.689 --> 58:41.310
- Hey, daddy!
- Oh, hey, buddy.

58:43.310 --> 58:45.172
How are you?

58:45.206 --> 58:49.000
Why don't you get
your backpack ready, little man?

58:49.034 --> 58:51.034
- Okay.
- Go upstairs.

58:54.206 --> 58:56.344
What's going on?

58:56.344 --> 59:00.896
Grey, why can't you just
try harder?

59:02.034 --> 59:03.862
CAROL:
James is such
a wonderful little kid,

59:03.896 --> 59:05.862
he needs a father.

59:05.896 --> 59:08.068
He has his father.

59:08.103 --> 59:10.034
CAROL:
Oh, does he?

59:10.068 --> 59:16.137
You know, I love you, Grey,
I really do,

59:16.206 --> 59:18.620
but we never should
have had you.

59:18.689 --> 59:22.137
I let you down, Grey.

59:22.206 --> 59:24.793
That's my legacy.

59:24.862 --> 59:26.724
Now, you're doing
the same damn thing

59:26.724 --> 59:29.379
with your family.

59:29.413 --> 59:32.965
I'm doing the best that I can.

59:35.068 --> 59:36.689
That's what concerns me.

59:36.724 --> 59:40.413
I'm a good dad.

59:40.448 --> 59:45.103
You know, what they um,
called kids like you

59:45.137 --> 59:48.724
when I was still teaching?

59:48.758 --> 59:53.793
"Wasted potential".

59:53.827 --> 59:57.655
Still drawing pictures
and telling stories.

59:57.724 --> 59:59.413
I like drawing.
It makes me happy.

59:59.413 --> 1:00:01.137
Doesn't happiness count
for anything?

1:00:01.206 --> 1:00:03.275
James likes my art,
we're makin' a book together.

1:00:04.793 --> 1:00:09.655
And how's that working out
for you?

1:00:09.724 --> 1:00:14.172
Oh, you're such an angry
little kid.

1:00:15.310 --> 1:00:18.758
And you're still angry.

1:00:18.758 --> 1:00:21.724
Maybe that's your real
fucking legacy, huh?

1:00:21.724 --> 1:00:23.931
Well, maybe it is.

1:00:28.241 --> 1:00:32.241
You are responsible
for your actions.

1:00:32.275 --> 1:00:38.413
You are responsible
for where you are in life

1:00:38.448 --> 1:00:40.862
not anybody else.

1:00:43.137 --> 1:00:49.241
No, the world
doesn't owe you anything.

1:00:50.931 --> 1:00:55.965
It doesn't owe you shit.

1:00:56.034 --> 1:00:58.965
Sometimes I can't even stand
to look at you.

1:01:02.448 --> 1:01:05.758
CAROL:
Stand up and be a man
for God's sake!

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:12.724
Hey!

1:01:12.793 --> 1:01:15.965
Why don't you uh, go out
and play some baseball

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.965
and get some exercise.

1:01:20.137 --> 1:01:21.241
Hey bud, ready to go?

1:01:21.275 --> 1:01:23.034
Yeah.

1:01:23.103 --> 1:01:25.206
But stay away
from that damn book.

1:01:25.275 --> 1:01:26.275
Come on, let's go.

1:02:04.413 --> 1:02:05.551
Good job, buddy.

1:02:05.586 --> 1:02:07.275
You can put that in the jar
when we get home, okay?

1:03:00.448 --> 1:03:04.275
"And then Prince Ernest
and all the prince's men

1:03:04.275 --> 1:03:07.413
raced across the drawbridge
into the castle

1:03:07.448 --> 1:03:09.896
where Princess Emily
was waiting,

1:03:09.931 --> 1:03:12.482
but she had a surprise."

1:03:15.379 --> 1:03:16.551
Aww!

1:03:18.448 --> 1:03:21.000
That's it for tonight, bud,
it's past your bedtime.

1:03:21.068 --> 1:03:22.586
But what happened next?

1:03:22.586 --> 1:03:24.103
We can read more tomorrow.

1:03:24.103 --> 1:03:26.000
It's time for sleep.

1:03:26.068 --> 1:03:26.931
Okay?

1:03:26.931 --> 1:03:28.137
Okay.

1:03:28.172 --> 1:03:29.344
Alright, goodnight, buddy.

1:03:29.413 --> 1:03:30.965
Goodnight, dad.

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000
Love you more than ice cream.

1:03:33.068 --> 1:03:35.827
Love you more than cake.

1:03:35.896 --> 1:03:38.896
Love you more
than ice cream cake.

1:03:38.931 --> 1:03:40.137
That's not your thing.

1:03:40.172 --> 1:03:41.965
You're makin' that up.

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:43.241
Yeah, it's time for bed.

1:03:43.275 --> 1:03:44.413
We can go to the fair tomorrow,
okay?

1:03:44.448 --> 1:03:45.448
Okay.

1:03:45.482 --> 1:03:47.275
- Goodnight.
- Night light.

1:03:47.275 --> 1:03:48.793
Yeah, I'll put it on right now.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.172
JAMES:
Dad.

1:03:53.241 --> 1:03:55.103
Yeah?

1:03:55.137 --> 1:03:57.896
JAMES:
We're not going to Disneyland,
are we?

1:04:00.620 --> 1:04:04.379
Yes, we are, I promise.

1:04:04.413 --> 1:04:07.206
JAMES:
It's okay
you can't afford it, dad.

1:04:09.172 --> 1:04:11.517
James.

1:04:11.551 --> 1:04:13.379
Son, look at me.

1:04:15.241 --> 1:04:18.344
We're going to Disneyland.

1:04:18.379 --> 1:04:20.965
I promise.

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.965
We just have to save up
for it first.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.655
Every penny matters.

1:04:27.655 --> 1:04:28.896
That's right, son.

1:04:33.172 --> 1:04:35.310
Did you take the money, daddy?

1:04:41.172 --> 1:04:42.344
Go to bed.

1:04:49.517 --> 1:04:51.068
I don't know, I want 'em all.

1:04:51.137 --> 1:04:52.551
Well, you better get
what you can

1:04:52.586 --> 1:04:54.689
while you got a chance
before the laws change,

1:04:54.724 --> 1:04:56.965
'cause it's really only
a matter of time.

1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.344
Hey.

1:04:58.344 --> 1:05:00.241
Hey, Mr. Bill, how you doin'
this fine evenin'?

1:05:00.310 --> 1:05:01.344
Yeah, yeah.

1:05:03.241 --> 1:05:03.724
Fine.

1:05:03.758 --> 1:05:05.241
What's all this?

1:05:05.275 --> 1:05:08.413
WINSLOW:
This is my fine selection
of firearms.

1:05:08.448 --> 1:05:10.206
We're gonna be shootin'
these on Sunday.

1:05:10.241 --> 1:05:11.482
Like I said before,
it'd be really cool

1:05:11.551 --> 1:05:12.689
if you could join us.

1:05:12.724 --> 1:05:14.724
We will have a good time.

1:05:14.758 --> 1:05:17.206
- Are these things loaded?
- LIAM: No, no.

1:05:17.241 --> 1:05:18.275
Because my son is right there

1:05:18.344 --> 1:05:19.724
and I really don't feel
comfortable with you guys

1:05:19.758 --> 1:05:20.965
having these in the house

1:05:21.034 --> 1:05:22.241
- and I'm--
- LIAM: No, no.

1:05:22.275 --> 1:05:25.655
Only gun I ever carry loaded
is right here in my holster.

1:05:25.724 --> 1:05:27.448
You guys are shooting
all of these on Sunday?

1:05:28.448 --> 1:05:30.275
Yes, sir, we are.

1:05:30.310 --> 1:05:31.965
Every damn one of 'em.

1:05:32.034 --> 1:05:34.310
- You should come.
- No, I can't.

1:05:34.379 --> 1:05:36.620
Well, I'm buyin'
the assault rifle on Friday.

1:05:36.655 --> 1:05:38.103
I think it'd be good to have
a firearm around

1:05:38.137 --> 1:05:39.517
for the protection, you know?

1:05:39.551 --> 1:05:41.241
For home protection?

1:05:41.275 --> 1:05:43.241
You need one of these
for home protection?

1:05:43.275 --> 1:05:44.758
From what, a bear?

1:05:44.758 --> 1:05:47.379
We do live in uncertain times,
Mr. Bell.

1:05:47.413 --> 1:05:49.965
Liam, my son is right there.

1:05:50.034 --> 1:05:51.034
I don't feel comfortable
with you

1:05:51.068 --> 1:05:53.482
having this in the house.

1:05:53.551 --> 1:05:56.379
I'm also buyin' a trigger lock
and a locking gun case.

1:06:02.275 --> 1:06:06.517
WINSLOW:
Safe as rain, Mr. Bell,
I guaran-damn-tee it.

1:06:06.551 --> 1:06:08.310
Hey, I'm gonna step out
for a smoke.

1:06:08.344 --> 1:06:10.241
You guys cool?

1:06:10.275 --> 1:06:11.413
Yeah.

1:06:11.448 --> 1:06:13.103
Awesome.

1:06:17.655 --> 1:06:20.655
So you buy and sell
these things?

1:06:20.655 --> 1:06:23.517
I mean you got a shitload
of guns.

1:06:23.551 --> 1:06:26.482
You interested in purchasin'
a firearm or sellin' them,

1:06:26.482 --> 1:06:30.103
- for that matter.
- No, no.

1:06:30.137 --> 1:06:31.172
Well--

1:06:33.103 --> 1:06:36.137
It's my card, as they say.

1:06:36.172 --> 1:06:38.827
Got all my complete
contact information on there.

1:06:38.827 --> 1:06:40.482
All that pertinent information
is located right there

1:06:40.482 --> 1:06:42.655
in front of the card.

1:06:42.689 --> 1:06:44.827
And on the back of the card.

1:06:44.862 --> 1:06:47.275
That there's a picture
of an M1 Abrams tank.

1:06:48.620 --> 1:06:49.793
I know.

1:06:52.379 --> 1:06:55.379
Give me a call if you change
your mind, Mr. Bell.

1:06:55.448 --> 1:06:58.344
I'd be here within the hour
with guns in hand.

1:06:58.379 --> 1:07:00.344
Or cash to buy
if you're sellin'.

1:07:00.344 --> 1:07:01.862
Okay.

1:07:01.896 --> 1:07:03.724
What about background checks?

1:07:05.551 --> 1:07:06.758
What about 'em?

1:07:11.896 --> 1:07:15.724
Hey, I also carry about
10 grand in cash

1:07:15.758 --> 1:07:20.034
at all times for that
more discreet customer.

1:07:23.241 --> 1:07:25.241
I do have some very important
business to discuss

1:07:25.275 --> 1:07:27.379
- with my compatriot Liam.
- Mmhmm.

1:07:27.379 --> 1:07:28.758
You'll excuse me Mr. Bell.

1:07:28.827 --> 1:07:30.413
I'll talk to you later.

1:07:30.448 --> 1:07:31.724
You got my card,
you can give a call

1:07:31.758 --> 1:07:33.344
if you change your mind.

1:07:33.379 --> 1:07:34.344
Okay.

1:08:41.551 --> 1:08:42.931
What do want to do, bud?

1:08:44.655 --> 1:08:45.758
Yeah.

1:08:52.655 --> 1:08:53.724
Oh, look at this one,
that's a goat.

1:08:53.758 --> 1:08:54.931
- Do you see him?
- Yeah.

1:08:54.931 --> 1:08:55.931
Yeah.

1:09:36.896 --> 1:09:40.517
"And Prince Ernest knew
what he must do.

1:09:40.551 --> 1:09:45.000
Climb to the top
of Midnight Mountain."

1:09:46.827 --> 1:09:48.689
That is it for tonight.

1:09:48.724 --> 1:09:50.689
- Time for bed, okay?
- Okay.

1:09:50.724 --> 1:09:52.827
Here, lay down
and get all covered up.

1:09:52.827 --> 1:09:55.000
Alright, got your dinosaur.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.620
- Good?
- Yeah.

1:09:56.655 --> 1:09:57.655
Alright.

1:10:01.482 --> 1:10:02.793
Love you, buddy.

1:10:02.827 --> 1:10:04.241
Goodnight, dad.

1:10:04.310 --> 1:10:05.551
Love you.

1:10:05.586 --> 1:10:07.827
Love you more than ice cream.

1:10:07.862 --> 1:10:10.724
More than birthday cake
ice cream?

1:10:10.793 --> 1:10:11.724
Yeah.

1:10:13.793 --> 1:10:14.862
Alright, goodnight,
go to sleep.

1:11:03.068 --> 1:11:04.068
Get your backpack, James.

1:11:04.068 --> 1:11:05.586
Don't leave it out here.

1:11:05.586 --> 1:11:07.724
Go on inside
and put it your room.

1:11:07.724 --> 1:11:08.931
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:11:08.931 --> 1:11:10.551
Did you guys have
a good weekend?

1:11:10.551 --> 1:11:11.413
Yeah.

1:11:11.448 --> 1:11:14.310
Good, I'm glad.

1:11:14.379 --> 1:11:15.758
Sorry, we're late.

1:11:15.793 --> 1:11:16.896
That's okay.

1:11:16.931 --> 1:11:18.413
It's--

1:11:18.448 --> 1:11:22.517
- Is my mom still here?
- No.

1:11:22.551 --> 1:11:25.551
What was she doing here?

1:11:25.586 --> 1:11:27.310
She was helping me pack.

1:11:27.379 --> 1:11:29.724
Pack, for what?

1:11:30.655 --> 1:11:32.689
Come on inside, Grey,
we need to talk.

1:11:35.689 --> 1:11:37.931
Grey, close the door.

1:11:37.965 --> 1:11:39.206
James, go to your room, honey.

1:11:39.241 --> 1:11:41.896
Mommy wants to talk to daddy
in private for a minute, okay?

1:11:48.068 --> 1:11:51.724
So what's going on?

1:11:53.413 --> 1:11:55.862
- We're moving, Grey.
- Oh, okay.

1:11:55.896 --> 1:12:00.586
Um, you need my help
moving stuff or--

1:12:02.482 --> 1:12:04.724
It's California.

1:12:04.793 --> 1:12:09.517
My job had a management opening
in San Pedro, I applied,

1:12:09.551 --> 1:12:14.000
I was a perfect candidate,
and I got the job.

1:12:14.034 --> 1:12:17.620
Okay, it's a good job,
it's a huge salary increase,

1:12:17.655 --> 1:12:20.620
and they'll help pay for us
to relocate.

1:12:20.655 --> 1:12:22.827
I can finally take James
to Disneyland.

1:12:22.827 --> 1:12:24.758
I was gonna take James
to Disneyland.

1:12:24.793 --> 1:12:27.000
No, you weren't, Grey.

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.689
You've been stringing him along
for two years now.

1:12:29.758 --> 1:12:31.965
Putting pennies in a jar?

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.379
Are you for real?

1:12:34.448 --> 1:12:35.655
He knows you're broke, Grey.

1:12:35.655 --> 1:12:37.620
He's not stupid, okay?
He knows.

1:12:37.655 --> 1:12:38.689
I'm looking for another job.

1:12:38.758 --> 1:12:40.586
Stop it, okay?

1:12:40.620 --> 1:12:42.103
Just stop!

1:12:42.137 --> 1:12:44.379
You're not looking
for a better job,

1:12:44.448 --> 1:12:46.862
you're not taking him
to Disneyland.

1:12:46.896 --> 1:12:51.000
You're breaking his heart
and he loves you.

1:12:51.034 --> 1:12:53.517
Okay, I don't wanna fight
about this anymore.

1:12:53.551 --> 1:12:54.896
We're workin'
on our book together.

1:12:54.965 --> 1:12:56.793
As soon as it's done,
then we're gonna sell it,

1:12:56.827 --> 1:12:57.827
- and I'm gonna--
- Your book?

1:12:57.862 --> 1:13:00.379
- Your-- your stupid ogre book?
- Yes, our--

1:13:00.448 --> 1:13:01.689
The one that you
you've been working on

1:13:01.689 --> 1:13:03.000
- since he was born?
- Yeah--

1:13:03.034 --> 1:13:04.000
- That book?
- Yes, that book.

1:13:04.034 --> 1:13:05.103
We're workin' on it together--

1:13:05.172 --> 1:13:06.793
And as soon as it's finished,
we're gonna sell it.

1:13:06.862 --> 1:13:10.827
Grey, just stop and listen
to yourself, okay?

1:13:10.862 --> 1:13:13.689
I can't wait for you anymore.

1:13:20.586 --> 1:13:26.034
Grey, I have waited for you
for almost two years.

1:13:26.068 --> 1:13:30.517
I have sat here day after day
and night after night,

1:13:30.551 --> 1:13:32.620
watching you break
our son's heart

1:13:32.689 --> 1:13:35.448
by being a failure
who can't even afford

1:13:35.517 --> 1:13:38.068
to take care of his family.

1:13:38.103 --> 1:13:39.206
Look at you!

1:13:39.206 --> 1:13:42.068
You can't even take care
of yourself!

1:13:42.103 --> 1:13:45.034
And I've given up on you, Grey.

1:13:45.068 --> 1:13:49.793
I have finally realized that
this is who you are.

1:13:49.862 --> 1:13:53.689
I am sorry, but we are moving
and we're never coming back.

1:13:53.724 --> 1:13:55.517
I told you that I'm lookin'
for another job.

1:13:56.517 --> 1:13:59.137
I'm gonna figure something out,
okay?

1:13:59.206 --> 1:14:01.103
I can start paying more towards
his daycare if that helps.

1:14:01.137 --> 1:14:04.000
It's too late, Grey.

1:14:04.068 --> 1:14:07.655
Are you taking your meds?

1:14:07.724 --> 1:14:11.000
No, I-- I can't afford 'em.

1:14:11.068 --> 1:14:13.241
You can't afford them?

1:14:13.275 --> 1:14:16.137
Tell me, Grey,
what can you afford, huh?

1:14:16.172 --> 1:14:20.896
What can Mr. Greyson Bell,
fabulous artist, afford?

1:14:20.931 --> 1:14:21.965
I'll be fine.

1:14:22.034 --> 1:14:24.620
I just have to make it
through a couple of weeks.

1:14:24.655 --> 1:14:26.000
MARILYN:
A couple of weeks?

1:14:26.068 --> 1:14:28.103
Didn't you say
a couple of weeks last week?

1:14:28.137 --> 1:14:30.103
And this week,
and then next paycheck,

1:14:30.137 --> 1:14:31.482
and next month?

1:14:31.551 --> 1:14:33.103
What about now?

1:14:33.103 --> 1:14:35.172
I'll start paying child support.

1:14:35.241 --> 1:14:37.793
- Is that what you want?
- I don't want child support!

1:14:37.793 --> 1:14:40.586
I don't want anything from you,
I never have.

1:14:40.620 --> 1:14:45.586
All I wanted was you
to be a man, and a father,

1:14:45.620 --> 1:14:48.724
and to provide for his son!

1:14:48.758 --> 1:14:50.620
MARILYN:
I wanted you.

1:14:58.586 --> 1:15:00.793
I'm trying.

1:15:00.827 --> 1:15:02.551
No, you're not!

1:15:02.620 --> 1:15:03.965
Don't you dare say that!

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.689
I don't you dare put this on me!

1:15:06.689 --> 1:15:08.655
MARILYN:
This is on you, Grey, you!

1:15:11.034 --> 1:15:15.310
This is who you are, this is all
you'll ever amount to.

1:15:15.344 --> 1:15:16.827
Are you happy?

1:15:16.827 --> 1:15:18.896
Are you fuckin' happy?

1:15:18.965 --> 1:15:20.827
Okay, I said it.

1:15:20.827 --> 1:15:23.000
- I can't--
- No.

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.344
Yeah, well, neither am I.

1:15:31.206 --> 1:15:33.827
Why are you looking
at your phone?

1:15:33.862 --> 1:15:35.206
It's not like you've paid
your bill in months,

1:15:35.241 --> 1:15:38.172
you don't even have service!

1:15:38.172 --> 1:15:42.172
This is exactly the kind of shit
that I'm talking about!

1:15:42.206 --> 1:15:45.137
You can't just go on pretending
everything's okay

1:15:45.172 --> 1:15:47.000
like nobody notices.

1:15:53.689 --> 1:15:54.896
Please.

1:15:59.862 --> 1:16:03.724
Please, don't take my son away.

1:16:03.758 --> 1:16:05.620
Please, he's the only good thing

1:16:05.689 --> 1:16:09.068
I have left in my life, please.

1:16:09.068 --> 1:16:10.379
Please, don't take him away.

1:16:10.413 --> 1:16:12.965
No, we're moving to California,
you can come visit him there.

1:16:13.034 --> 1:16:14.413
I can't afford that.

1:16:14.413 --> 1:16:16.137
Then get a better job!

1:16:16.206 --> 1:16:18.310
I'll get an attorney.

1:16:18.379 --> 1:16:20.103
You can't even afford
to feed your son

1:16:20.137 --> 1:16:23.034
and you're threatening me
with an attorney!

1:16:23.068 --> 1:16:25.068
Go to hell, Grey!

1:16:25.103 --> 1:16:26.896
He deserves a better father
than you.

1:16:26.896 --> 1:16:27.862
Don't say that!

1:16:33.068 --> 1:16:36.896
JAMES:
Daddy, stop, don't hurt mommy.

1:16:36.931 --> 1:16:38.413
MARILYN:
Grey, please go away.

1:16:38.448 --> 1:16:41.137
Don't ever, ever come back.

1:16:41.206 --> 1:16:42.724
Just go.

1:16:44.103 --> 1:16:46.034
Go!

1:16:55.275 --> 1:16:56.896
GREYSON:
Yes, I understand that
it's closed on the weekend,

1:16:56.931 --> 1:16:58.206
but this is an emergency.

1:17:01.103 --> 1:17:03.827
Yes.

1:17:03.862 --> 1:17:05.103
Well, how much would that cost?

1:17:09.275 --> 1:17:10.965
Wait--

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.793
It costs how much to--
to file in court on Monday?

1:17:21.034 --> 1:17:22.068
No, I--

1:17:26.310 --> 1:17:28.103
No, I don't have any money.

1:17:31.137 --> 1:17:34.310
I don't know what else to do,
please, I need help.

1:17:40.379 --> 1:17:42.103
She's gonna take my son.

1:20:08.344 --> 1:20:10.275
Hey, Mr. Bell.

1:20:10.275 --> 1:20:13.344
How you doin' this fine evenin'?

1:20:13.413 --> 1:20:16.448
Where's my partner in crime?

1:20:16.448 --> 1:20:17.965
My dear friend and colleague
Mr. Brady,

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.448
where's he at tonight?

1:20:20.448 --> 1:20:22.965
Oh man, we had a hell
of a time shootin' today.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.931
It's a damn shame
you couldn't make it.

1:20:25.931 --> 1:20:28.275
He's with Janice.

1:20:28.275 --> 1:20:29.310
WINSLOW:
No shit.

1:20:30.206 --> 1:20:33.275
Well, he is quite
the ladies' man.

1:20:33.275 --> 1:20:35.931
As I'm sure you are, too,
Mr. Bell,

1:20:35.931 --> 1:20:37.241
speakin' of the ladies.

1:20:40.068 --> 1:20:41.103
You can almost fit
this little bastard

1:20:41.103 --> 1:20:42.103
in your boot.

1:20:44.482 --> 1:20:47.448
Check that out.

1:20:47.448 --> 1:20:49.068
That's pretty good convenient.

1:20:49.103 --> 1:20:50.413
Hmm.

1:20:52.413 --> 1:20:54.586
What about one like yours?

1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:57.344
My 9 mil?

1:20:57.413 --> 1:21:01.068
It's got some decent
stoppin' power in this one.

1:21:01.137 --> 1:21:02.413
I got a couple in my selection
right now

1:21:02.482 --> 1:21:04.482
if you're interested.

1:21:04.482 --> 1:21:06.482
Can I see it?

1:21:06.482 --> 1:21:07.551
Have a hand at it.

1:21:11.379 --> 1:21:15.241
Use two hands,
you'd be more accurate.

1:21:15.310 --> 1:21:16.275
There you go.

1:21:16.344 --> 1:21:21.000
Wanna close that left eye,
sight that sucker.

1:21:21.034 --> 1:21:22.068
Uh-huh.

1:21:22.137 --> 1:21:23.482
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1:21:27.206 --> 1:21:29.689
Do you have more bullets
for these?

1:21:29.689 --> 1:21:32.034
WINSLOW:
Hell yeah, I got some out
in my truck right now.

1:21:32.068 --> 1:21:35.413
I can get you some ammo
for that HK.

1:21:35.482 --> 1:21:37.068
Enough rounds for that bad boy
to take you

1:21:37.137 --> 1:21:41.068
right through the apocalypse,
reliable.

1:21:41.137 --> 1:21:44.931
Cash is okay?

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.344
WINSLOW:
Cash is legal currency,
Mr. Bell.

1:21:48.379 --> 1:21:51.344
Okay.

1:21:51.379 --> 1:21:54.689
I want one like this,
and some bullets for it,

1:21:54.724 --> 1:21:57.482
and bullets for the--
the one that Liam got.

1:21:59.172 --> 1:22:00.448
We're going shooting.

1:22:00.517 --> 1:22:02.965
No shit!

1:22:03.034 --> 1:22:05.310
Well, fuck it, hey.

1:22:05.379 --> 1:22:07.068
I'll go get some ammo
out of my truck right now.

1:22:07.068 --> 1:22:10.068
You sit tight.

1:22:10.103 --> 1:22:12.413
You know, Mr. Bell,
I do gotta ask though,

1:22:12.448 --> 1:22:14.724
you sure this is a good idea?

1:22:14.758 --> 1:22:17.551
You got enough cash for this
here transaction you know,

1:22:17.586 --> 1:22:19.310
'cause I have been led
to believe that times

1:22:19.379 --> 1:22:22.206
are kinda tough
and cash ain't flowin'

1:22:22.241 --> 1:22:25.206
so well anymore.

1:22:25.241 --> 1:22:29.620
I don't have any money,
but you do and I need it.

1:22:29.689 --> 1:22:30.724
I'm taking my son to Disneyland.

1:22:30.724 --> 1:22:32.103
Oh, Mr. Bell.

1:22:32.137 --> 1:22:33.310
No, just wait a minute.

1:22:33.379 --> 1:22:34.206
I don't actually ha--

1:22:34.241 --> 1:22:36.448
-

1:23:44.655 --> 1:23:48.758
You're broken, daddy.

1:23:48.793 --> 1:23:50.413
You're right, son.

1:25:57.586 --> 1:25:58.482
Grey.

1:26:00.310 --> 1:26:02.862
Are you okay?
Are you sick?

1:26:02.896 --> 1:26:04.724
No.

1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:09.310
I can hear the wizard.

1:26:14.655 --> 1:26:17.310
Dude, answer your phone!

1:26:19.862 --> 1:26:22.241
Putting pennies in a jar?

1:26:22.310 --> 1:26:23.413
Are you for real?

1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:25.689
He knows you're broke, Grey.

1:26:25.724 --> 1:26:27.344
He's not stupid, okay?

1:26:27.379 --> 1:26:30.551
You're breaking his heart
and he loves you.

1:26:30.586 --> 1:26:32.689
You're not looking
for a better job.

1:26:32.724 --> 1:26:34.827
You're not taking him
to Disneyland.

1:26:43.827 --> 1:26:46.586
Sometimes I can't even stand
to look at you.

1:26:46.655 --> 1:26:50.689
The world
doesn't owe you anything.

1:26:50.724 --> 1:26:53.379
It doesn't owe you shit.

1:26:53.413 --> 1:26:56.241
Stand up and be a man
for God's sake!

1:26:56.310 --> 1:26:57.620
BARNES:
Grey, you fuckin' freak!

1:26:57.655 --> 1:26:58.827
Pick up the fuckin' phone!

1:26:58.862 --> 1:27:00.586
I got six calls on hold!

1:27:00.655 --> 1:27:01.965
I can't wait for you anymore.

1:27:02.034 --> 1:27:04.586
You're not taking him
to Disneyland.

1:27:04.620 --> 1:27:05.275
BARNES:
No.

1:27:05.310 --> 1:27:07.034
No, ma'am, I'm -- I'm sorry.

1:27:07.068 --> 1:27:08.862
No.

1:27:08.896 --> 1:27:10.241
Hold on.

1:27:12.068 --> 1:27:14.068
This is who you are.

1:27:14.068 --> 1:27:16.931
You can't even take care
of yourself!

1:27:16.965 --> 1:27:20.620
I am sorry, but we are moving
and we're never coming back.

1:27:20.689 --> 1:27:22.448
Grey!

1:27:22.517 --> 1:27:23.862
God, fuck this!

1:27:27.931 --> 1:27:31.724
Did you take the money, daddy?

1:27:31.758 --> 1:27:34.862
We're not going to Disneyland,
are we?

1:27:34.896 --> 1:27:36.068
James?

1:27:36.068 --> 1:27:38.379
Dad.

1:27:38.379 --> 1:27:39.620
Buddy.

1:27:39.655 --> 1:27:41.896
It's too late, Grey.

1:27:41.931 --> 1:27:44.448
He needs more than eggs, Grey.

1:27:44.482 --> 1:27:46.862
You're breaking his heart.

1:27:46.896 --> 1:27:48.724
I'm trying, honey.

1:27:48.758 --> 1:27:49.965
No, you're not!

1:27:50.034 --> 1:27:54.448
All I wanted was you
to be a man, and a father,

1:27:54.482 --> 1:27:56.448
and to provide for his son!

1:27:56.482 --> 1:27:57.827
Go to hell, Grey!

1:27:57.896 --> 1:28:00.034
He deserves a better father
than you.

1:28:00.068 --> 1:28:01.586
I can fix this.

1:28:01.620 --> 1:28:02.793
I'm not an ogre!

1:28:08.689 --> 1:28:09.862
Get out of the way, Barnes.

1:28:09.896 --> 1:28:12.862
Dude, you need to stop
whatever the fuck you're doin'!

1:28:15.103 --> 1:28:16.620
I mean it.

1:28:21.689 --> 1:28:25.689
What the fuck, man,
just answer your phone, please.

1:28:25.724 --> 1:28:27.000
Sorry for the hold,
we're a little short-staffed

1:28:27.034 --> 1:28:28.689
at the moment, ma'am.

1:28:33.137 --> 1:28:35.758
ERIC:

1:28:41.137 --> 1:28:42.689
I need a raise today.

1:28:42.758 --> 1:28:45.482
I'm taking my son to Disneyland.

1:28:45.517 --> 1:28:47.137
Grey, I'm on the phone.

1:28:47.137 --> 1:28:48.793
Hey, can I call you back again?

1:28:48.827 --> 1:28:49.793
Yeah.

1:28:49.793 --> 1:28:50.793
Alright.

1:28:50.793 --> 1:28:51.862
Hey, thanks.

1:28:54.793 --> 1:28:55.448
You know what?

1:28:55.482 --> 1:28:56.827
Why don't you have a seat?

1:28:56.862 --> 1:28:58.931
BARNES:
Hashtag gorgeous.

1:28:58.965 --> 1:28:59.827
- Oh.
- JAMES: It's red.

1:28:59.827 --> 1:29:00.517
- Looks like Shrek's--
- Yeah, it is.

1:29:00.551 --> 1:29:01.413
JIM:
Looks like Shrek's dick.

1:29:01.448 --> 1:29:03.448
BRODY:
Oh my God, he is so full, man.

1:29:03.517 --> 1:29:04.827
- BARNES: My name's Zoey.
- JIM: Oh, oh.

1:29:04.862 --> 1:29:06.586
I like coffee and suckin' dick.

1:29:08.862 --> 1:29:10.827
BRODY:
Shouldn't it be green
if it's Shrek's dick?

1:29:12.689 --> 1:29:14.000
What are you doing?

1:29:14.034 --> 1:29:15.862
Oof, mind your own business,
Zoey.

1:29:15.862 --> 1:29:17.034
This is Grey's!

1:29:17.068 --> 1:29:18.206
Yeah, I know.

1:29:18.206 --> 1:29:20.931
So it's his personal book
and you have no right to it!

1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.551
Aw, you seem to know
so much about it.

1:29:23.551 --> 1:29:24.482
Get the fuck out of my way!

1:29:24.517 --> 1:29:27.206
Oh, come on!

1:29:27.206 --> 1:29:28.931
Just talk to me.

1:29:28.965 --> 1:29:30.862
It's a children's book
he's writing with his son,

1:29:30.896 --> 1:29:32.862
you fucking asshole!

1:29:32.896 --> 1:29:34.103
You'd know.

1:29:34.172 --> 1:29:35.586
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:37.724
Come on, Zoey, just let it up.

1:29:37.758 --> 1:29:39.206
- Everybody knows.
- Everybody knows what?

1:29:39.241 --> 1:29:40.206
That we went to coffee?

1:29:40.206 --> 1:29:41.758
So fucking what?

1:29:41.827 --> 1:29:43.551
And that you've been fuckin'
him.

1:29:43.586 --> 1:29:45.172
- Fuck you!
-

1:29:45.206 --> 1:29:46.551
You already did that.

1:29:46.586 --> 1:29:47.862
Come on, Zoey,
like why can't

1:29:47.862 --> 1:29:49.551
you just give me
another chance?

1:29:49.586 --> 1:29:52.034
- I need a raise today.
- Hmm.

1:29:52.034 --> 1:29:54.068
So I can take my son
to Disneyland,

1:29:54.103 --> 1:29:58.724
so I can be a better dad,
so my wife won't leave me.

1:29:58.758 --> 1:30:00.034
I thought you were divorced.

1:30:00.034 --> 1:30:02.655
What's your problem?

1:30:02.689 --> 1:30:05.655
I do a good job.

1:30:05.689 --> 1:30:08.034
I never call in sick.

1:30:08.034 --> 1:30:08.931
I answer all my calls.

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:11.206
Why can't you just pay me
what I'm worth?

1:30:11.206 --> 1:30:12.965
So what if I fucking am?

1:30:13.034 --> 1:30:15.862
Oh, you fuckin' suck his dick
on the first date, too, Zoe--

1:30:17.068 --> 1:30:19.034
I was fucking drunk!

1:30:19.068 --> 1:30:22.586
Oh, you really weren't
that drunk.

1:30:22.655 --> 1:30:23.862
Just fuck you!

1:30:23.896 --> 1:30:24.931
What's he got that
I don't have, huh?

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:26.103
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1:30:26.172 --> 1:30:27.586
You already did that,
sweetheart.

1:30:27.655 --> 1:30:29.172
I like him!

1:30:29.206 --> 1:30:31.517
And he likes me
and that's all I want.

1:30:31.517 --> 1:30:33.862
Oh, come back.

1:30:33.862 --> 1:30:35.655
What's he have
that I don't have?

1:30:35.689 --> 1:30:38.896
An ogre dick?

1:30:38.896 --> 1:30:43.034
All that fucking matters to me
is to be a good father

1:30:43.068 --> 1:30:45.862
and you won't let me do that.

1:30:45.896 --> 1:30:48.620
Why don't you just pay me
what I'm worth?

1:30:48.689 --> 1:30:51.586
I think you should clean out
your desk, Grey.

1:30:51.620 --> 1:30:53.172
- We're done here.
- No, no.

1:30:53.206 --> 1:30:54.896
- You give me a raise.
- We're done here.

1:30:54.931 --> 1:30:58.000
You give me a raise, today.

1:30:58.034 --> 1:30:59.827
Hey, you gotta get out there
right now.

1:30:59.862 --> 1:31:01.655
Barnes is just flippin' out.

1:31:01.724 --> 1:31:02.586
About what?

1:31:02.655 --> 1:31:04.758
I don't know
but Zoey has Grey's book.

1:31:10.931 --> 1:31:13.000
Tell me how to help you, please.

1:31:13.068 --> 1:31:13.827
- Please.
-

1:31:13.896 --> 1:31:15.103
He ruined it.

1:31:15.103 --> 1:31:15.793
Just-- just tell me
what happened?

1:31:15.827 --> 1:31:17.758
- He ruined it.
- It's okay.

1:31:19.689 --> 1:31:20.655
Hey, take a deep breath, okay?

1:31:22.137 --> 1:31:23.724
Come on now,
just take a deep breath.

1:31:24.655 --> 1:31:26.103
Are you alright?

1:31:37.241 --> 1:31:39.620
Can I have my book, please?

1:31:39.655 --> 1:31:40.758
No, no.

1:31:40.758 --> 1:31:42.655
No.

1:31:42.724 --> 1:31:44.241
GREYSON:
Zoey.

1:31:44.275 --> 1:31:46.448
I'm so sorry.

1:31:47.965 --> 1:31:49.448
No.

1:32:50.344 --> 1:32:52.689
Loser.

1:32:56.827 --> 1:32:59.827
You're all alone.

1:33:04.068 --> 1:33:05.103
No.

1:33:09.206 --> 1:33:12.206
There is no Grey.

1:33:16.034 --> 1:33:18.931
Do it.

1:33:18.965 --> 1:33:21.137
Do it, Grey.

1:33:28.862 --> 1:33:29.896
Why?

1:33:33.275 --> 1:33:35.689
You ruined it!

1:33:35.724 --> 1:33:37.068
You ruined everything.

1:33:38.310 --> 1:33:40.724
I thought you were different
and you're just like them.

1:33:40.758 --> 1:33:42.724
Grey, I didn't, please.

1:33:42.758 --> 1:33:44.413
Don't, you're scaring me.

1:33:44.448 --> 1:33:48.103
It was my one chance
and you ruined it.

1:33:48.137 --> 1:33:49.862
And now I have nothing.

1:33:49.896 --> 1:33:51.137
Grey, I'm sorry.

1:33:51.206 --> 1:33:53.241
I didn't do it, I promise.

1:33:53.275 --> 1:33:56.379
- Please, stop.
- And you.

1:33:56.413 --> 1:33:59.896
Fuck you!

1:33:59.931 --> 1:34:04.482
Why can't you just pay me
what I'm worth?

1:34:04.517 --> 1:34:08.034
Why can't you just pay people
what they need to live?

1:34:08.103 --> 1:34:09.448
Look at me.

1:34:09.448 --> 1:34:12.034
Look at this.

1:34:12.103 --> 1:34:14.137
I'm fuckin' dying here.

1:34:14.172 --> 1:34:16.689
You made me break my promise
to my son.

1:34:18.413 --> 1:34:19.965
There's no food.

1:34:21.965 --> 1:34:23.862
He doesn't like eggs.

1:34:25.275 --> 1:34:26.448
And it's your fault.

1:34:29.310 --> 1:34:31.931
- Grey, please, don't--
- You're just like them.

1:34:31.965 --> 1:34:33.206
Please-- please, no, stop it.

1:34:33.275 --> 1:34:34.034
- You're just like all of them.
- Stop it, you're scaring me.

1:34:34.103 --> 1:34:36.034
You're in on it
like all of them.

1:34:36.103 --> 1:34:37.413
You're all in on it!

1:34:37.448 --> 1:34:38.689
All of you!

1:34:40.448 --> 1:34:41.310
Grey, please.

1:34:41.310 --> 1:34:42.931
There's no food.

1:34:42.965 --> 1:34:45.034
He doesn't like eggs.

1:34:45.103 --> 1:34:46.344
He doesn't like--

1:34:47.482 --> 1:34:50.344
He doesn't like eggs.

1:34:50.379 --> 1:34:51.965
Do it.

1:34:53.517 --> 1:34:55.413
Do it, Grey.

1:34:59.137 --> 1:35:01.000
ERIC:
Kate.

1:35:01.034 --> 1:35:02.793
- Kate!
- KATE: Yes.

1:35:02.862 --> 1:35:03.931
ERIC:
Why don't you call the police,
huh?

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.068
No, please!

1:35:06.103 --> 1:35:07.758
He doesn't mean it,
he's not like that, please,

1:35:07.827 --> 1:35:09.862
he just needs a chance, please.

1:35:09.896 --> 1:35:10.862
Guys, get back to work.

1:35:10.896 --> 1:35:12.517
- Please, don't.
- Zoey.

1:35:12.517 --> 1:35:13.931
- Don't.
- Zoey.

1:35:17.862 --> 1:35:19.862
- Come on, bitch.
- Leave him alone!

1:35:22.862 --> 1:35:24.068
BRODY:
Run!

1:35:26.896 --> 1:35:28.241
ZOEY:
Grey, no!
