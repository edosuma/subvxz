WEBVTT

00:09.134 --> 00:11.094
This is the pre-boarding announcement

00:11.178 --> 00:15.682
for Lusit Airways flight LLT154
to Marrakech.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.310
We are now inviting
those classified as small children…

00:18.393 --> 00:19.603
Come on. Where are you?

00:23.774 --> 00:27.528
Please have your boarding pass
and identification ready. Thank you.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.988
-ETA?
-Less than a minute.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.876
-Has there been a handover?
-Negative.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.007
Eyes on Dogs.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.352
Why is he airside?
Intel said target was inbound.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.895
He made visual contact, ma'am.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.105
Reconfirm.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.940
Second Desk requests we reconfirm visual.

01:05.022 --> 01:08.694
You're looking for an Asian male,
20s, backpack, blue shirt, white tee.

01:08.777 --> 01:12.072
Yes, confirmed,
and I have Dogs on standing by.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.829
Shit.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.039
Lost visual. Possible handover.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.624
What does he mean "possible handover"?

01:22.708 --> 01:24.835
-Cartwright, clarify.
-Did you catch anything on CCTV?

01:26.336 --> 01:29.173
Negative, that's what you're there for.
Repeat, clarify.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.883
He has a visual.
Did he see a handover or not?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.843
Lost visual momentarily.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.720
Repeat, possible handover.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.389
-Come on. Get out of the way.
-Blocked by the cleaner.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.392
Lusit Airways are pleased
to announce boarding

01:40.475 --> 01:43.437
for flight LLT154 to Marrakech.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.690
We would like to invite families
and those requiring assistance

01:46.773 --> 01:48.525
-to come forward first.
-Move, move, move.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.236
Please have your passports
and boarding card ready.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.740
Okay, have full visual on target again,

01:54.823 --> 01:56.992
but something has definitely gone
in or out of that backpack.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.076
Tell him to hold.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.495
Cartwright, hold your position.
Do not intercept.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.083
-Target is on the move.
-We have eyes on target. Hold.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.168
Ma'am?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.797
Hold your position, Cartwright.
Hold your position. We are assessing.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.091
Target is joining the queue to board.
Standing by.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.593
Keep the channel clear, please.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.471
Come on.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.307
Second Desk says,
"Do not intercept."

02:22.684 --> 02:25.020
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.817
-Push the button.
-Dogs are standing by, ma'am.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.572
At least he's heading downstairs.
There's 300 bodies up there.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.866
Yes, but he's headed to
a plane loaded with fuel.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.953
First passengers are
on the tarmac, ma'am.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.793
-Authorize.
-Apprehend suspect.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.961
Dogs, go.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.171
Move!

02:54.842 --> 02:56.969
-Out of the way!
-Move!

02:59.096 --> 03:00.556
-Down, down, down!
-What the fuck?

03:00.639 --> 03:01.932
Get the fuck off me!

03:03.016 --> 03:05.352
Disperse if you can. Keep calm.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.729
-Get back!
-Get off me!

03:07.813 --> 03:09.481
-What the fuck?
-Relax!

03:09.565 --> 03:11.149
-What are you doing?
-No trigger.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.901
-This is fucking harassment!
-No wires here.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.695
-Clear.
-Bag.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.948
-Get off! Get off me.
-Over.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.621
Somebody film this! Fuck!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.957
-Get off me! Nothing on me!
-Stop moving!

03:31.628 --> 03:32.629
He's clean.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.299
Repeat. Repeat!

03:35.382 --> 03:37.801
He's clean.
There's no device, no weapon. Nothing.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.428
-Ma'am?
-He has the wrong suspect,

03:39.511 --> 03:41.597
or we have the wrong intel,
and we don't have the wrong intel.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.974
-Ma'am, he reconfirmed visual.
-Reconfirm again.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.809
Cartwright, confirm suspect description.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.521
Asian male, 20s, backpack,
blue shirt, white tee.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.106
I said, "white shirt, blue tee."

03:52.399 --> 03:53.525
You--

03:53.609 --> 03:56.737
No, no, no, no, you said--
you said, "blue shirt, white tee."

03:56.820 --> 03:58.363
Webb.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.448
Yeah.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.367
Shit. Put it on the main screen.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.786
White shirt, blue tee. Suspect is inbound.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.914
Inbound, headed to immigration,
main terminal.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.332
Stand Cartwright down. He's done.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.709
Second Desk says
stand down, Cartwright.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.630
Oh, shit.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.966
-Stand him down.
-Cartwright, where are you going?

04:18.050 --> 04:19.843
You tailed the wrong suspect.
You're stood down.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.678
Get me CCTV on that escalator now.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.852
-Should we have immigration hold him up?
-Not with a bomb on his back.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.479
-Get SO15 on standby.
-Ma'am.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.231
SO15, standby.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.030
-He'll be through in two minutes.
-Duffy, where are your Dogs?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.532
Still airside with Cartwright's suspect.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.117
Jesus Christ!
If you can't get your guys there,

04:44.201 --> 04:45.911
get SO15 on the ground now.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.496
We got something behind immigration?

04:47.579 --> 04:48.539
Excuse me.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.666
Hey! Hey!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.627
-How long?
-Three minutes.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.878
He's through.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.594
There.
He's headed to baggage reclaim.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.888
Stay on him. I need eyes
at the end of that concourse.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.807
-Yep. Coming up now.
-Head to the carousel.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.980
He's headed to baggage reclaim.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.690
Give me cameras
at the end of baggage reclaim.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.191
I want eyes there.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.455
Not a Dog in sight.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.623
Duffy, those are your guys?

05:31.707 --> 05:33.208
No. No, ma'am. They're en route.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.335
Duffy, surely we've got
transport police on that concourse.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.171
Waiting. Inbound, two minutes.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.134
Thank you!

05:44.720 --> 05:46.305
He's not waiting for luggage.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.348
What? He's walking straight out.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.235
Get out of the way! Move!

06:00.319 --> 06:01.528
Move, move, move, move!

06:04.656 --> 06:05.782
Sorry.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.452
I'm service, I'm service.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.871
I'm service! Move now!

06:14.291 --> 06:17.461
-I need an image. Why is it dark in there?
-There's no cameras, ma'am.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.171
-I want eyes now!
-Confirm with Stansted.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.924
Dogs, intercept!
Suspect's now landside. Where are you?

06:27.971 --> 06:28.931
-There.
-He swapped backpacks.

06:29.014 --> 06:29.932
That's the handover.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.683
Smash the glass.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.812
This is an emergency. Please evacuate.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.152
Ladies and gentlemen,
please evacuation the terminal!

06:42.236 --> 06:43.820
Evacuate the terminal all the way…

06:43.904 --> 06:45.989
-…this exit. This exit.
-Work out the safe areas.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.491
Keep them safe. Don't let anyone pass.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.919
This way please. Ladies and gentlemen,
this way. Quick as you can.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.845
Move, move, move, move!

07:10.639 --> 07:11.640
Move!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.568
Move! Aside!

07:23.151 --> 07:25.195
Move! Out of the way! Now!

07:26.905 --> 07:28.699
He's headed for the Stansted Express.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.286
Get out of the way!

07:35.205 --> 07:37.040
Move! Get to the side.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.292
Come on!

07:40.961 --> 07:42.421
Get it cleared. Full evacuation.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.089
Evacuate the entire train station.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.466
I want any trains
coming into Stansted halted.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.635
Any trains that are in-bound,
I need to know about it.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.137
Move, move, move!

07:56.393 --> 07:57.811
Move, move, move!

08:00.480 --> 08:01.773
Move, move, move!

08:02.441 --> 08:04.985
-Move, move, move, move, move!
-This way!

08:06.028 --> 08:07.779
Keep moving, guys. Come on.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.033
Place is closed! Stop! Stop!

08:11.116 --> 08:12.159
What are you doing?

08:24.963 --> 08:30.511
Stop! No! Step away now!
Step away! Don't do it!

11:28.772 --> 11:29.773
No?

11:30.566 --> 11:31.859
Yeah? Great!

11:49.376 --> 11:50.669
Standish.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.266
-Are you all in?
-All except River and Sid.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.227
Yeah, well,
the last one in can clean my lav.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.192
I thought spooks were
supposed to be stealthy.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.116
Another day dawns on MI-Fucking Useless.

12:56.652 --> 12:57.986
Morning, Max.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.030
The usual, Mr. Hobden?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.115
Yes, Max. The usual.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.499
His name isn't Max.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.710
Well, it says "Max"
on the front of the shop.

13:13.794 --> 13:17.089
Yeah, but I heard the staff
call him Theo, short for Theodosios.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.800
I'll stick with "Max." Shorter.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.305
There you go.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.224
Thank you, Max.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.205
What are you looking for?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.334
A reason not to blow my brains out.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.673
He hasn't told me yet
what I'm looking for.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.842
Dumping the rubbish this side of the room.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.303
Do you think Sid will find this
as amusing as you do?

14:11.476 --> 14:12.853
-Hello, Catherine.
-Morning.

14:12.936 --> 14:13.937
Morning.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.775
Bradford driving license applications,

14:18.859 --> 14:22.529
addresses, council tax records.
Cross-check.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.573
Well, these are from 2005.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.993
The lending list
from Luton libraries in the last year.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.453
At least yours is topical.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.705
Flag any borrowing
that suggests money laundering.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.374
Really?
Someone looking that up in the library

14:34.458 --> 14:36.376
probably doesn't have
that much money to launder.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.587
Parking tickets from the Euston area.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.799
From the '90s?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.343
No stone unturned, eh?

14:44.426 --> 14:45.469
Oh, Catherine!

14:45.552 --> 14:48.555
Catherine, before you go,
these two stick-in-the-muds

14:48.639 --> 14:51.683
are giving my idea of a pub quiz team
a big thumbs down.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.519
Actually, I gave it a fat middle finger.

14:53.602 --> 14:57.147
Come on, guys! What about team spirit?
Catherine?

14:57.231 --> 14:58.232
No.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.527
-"No," as in "Ask me later," or no--
-As in, "no."

15:03.820 --> 15:06.365
Tough nut to crack, that Catherine,
but I'll get there.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.909
-Forget it. She never lightens up.
-Would you?

15:08.992 --> 15:11.161
If I was Lamb's lackey, no.

15:11.245 --> 15:14.248
No, I meant what happened before.
Before she came here.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.667
Yeah, well, I wish Lamb
would go that way.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.883
Is today the day you finally give me
something remotely challenging?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.637
Flight inquiries to Syria
from the previous decade.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.014
No, it isn't.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.683
Well, I'll set up an algorithm for that

15:32.766 --> 15:35.853
and treat the remaining nine hours
of the day as my own time.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.523
Jed? Transport police are asking

15:39.606 --> 15:42.401
if you can stop scaring people away
from that bus stop.

15:43.277 --> 15:46.572
-They could be watching us.
-Or they could be waiting for a bus.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.575
Also, Lamb says there's a new hire

15:49.658 --> 15:51.451
-at the Chinese down--
-Oh, fuck me!

15:51.535 --> 15:53.078
-And he'd like--
-I know, I know.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.413
Interview and background.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.916
And if he happens to be undocumented, it's
five free meals to look the other way.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.209
Man.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.588
No, I've been keeping me eyes
on the water.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.298
I'm just waiting for a fin to surface,

16:04.381 --> 16:09.428
but I need you to guarantee me
2,000 words once it breaks.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.263
It's like your Watergate.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.225
You know what?
I can't tell you now because it--

16:23.775 --> 16:27.279
Sorry, the reason I interrupted before

16:27.362 --> 16:31.533
is because I spent a year studying
in Greece and the name caught my ear.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.203
Was a great country
a couple of thousand years ago.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.954
Yeah.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.499
And I'm interrupting now because
I was hoping I could borrow your Times.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.130
-Fine.
-Thank you.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.090
Oh, what--

16:47.174 --> 16:48.800
-Oh, my God. I am so--
-Oh, shit.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.969
-I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry.
-Oh, shit.

16:51.637 --> 16:56.016
Can I please have some towels? Okay.
Can I just have some serviettes?

16:56.099 --> 16:58.185
No, I need more serviettes.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.771
-God, I'm so--
-Here. Here.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.481
Yeah, napkins. Can we get some more?

17:02.564 --> 17:03.690
Thank you.

17:03.774 --> 17:07.277
Max, this is not enough. Have you--
Have you got any more serviettes?

17:07.361 --> 17:09.570
-Max, pass me that.
-Take this. Take this.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.742
-Just leave it. Excuse me.
-I'm so, so clumsy.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.369
-Would you leave it?
-No, I feel so bad. Is your laptop okay?

17:16.453 --> 17:18.413
It's okay. Let me clean it up now.

17:18.955 --> 17:19.998
Fuck!

17:21.290 --> 17:22.291
Fucking…

17:39.685 --> 17:40.811
You thumped?

17:42.437 --> 17:43.647
Did you find anything?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.608
I don't know what I'm looking for.

17:46.692 --> 17:50.779
Yeah, the remnants
of a once-promising career.

17:52.948 --> 17:56.451
Are we actually acting on any intel,
or are we just fishing?

17:56.535 --> 17:58.829
Yeah, but now,
you don't get to ask questions.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.291
That's for spies who haven't shat the bed.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.420
So, what did you find? Any old notebooks?

18:07.671 --> 18:10.132
The cardboard backing of one,
but no pages.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.592
Evidence of drug use?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.635
Empty box of paracetamol, yeah.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.179
Empty booze bottles?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.431
In his recycling bin, I imagine.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.433
Oh, Christ.

18:19.516 --> 18:23.729
Is it me, or did all the fun
go out of everything around 1979?

18:23.812 --> 18:25.230
Are we looking for something,

18:25.314 --> 18:27.357
or are we just wanting him to know
that we are looking at him?

18:27.441 --> 18:30.611
What's all this "we"? There is no "we."

18:30.694 --> 18:33.488
There's just me telling you what to do.

18:33.572 --> 18:36.575
Okay. Do you want to tell me
to put him under surveillance?

18:37.451 --> 18:38.452
Who?

18:39.620 --> 18:40.621
Hobden.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.333
You would be doing the surveillance?

18:44.416 --> 18:45.542
Yeah.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.461
-You?
-Yeah.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.380
Well--

18:50.464 --> 18:53.050
That's a-- Well,
that's an interesting proposition,

18:53.133 --> 18:57.012
considering the last time
you were given any sort of responsibility,

18:57.095 --> 18:59.306
a load of innocent people
got blown to bits.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.557
And there it is.

19:00.641 --> 19:03.310
Well, I'm sorry you find it so tiresome,
Cartwright,

19:03.393 --> 19:06.480
but it's not the social faux pas
you seem to think it was.

19:06.563 --> 19:10.275
You didn't break wind
during someone's wedding vows.

19:10.901 --> 19:15.030
What was it? 149 dead, 212 injured,

19:15.822 --> 19:19.076
Three million in damages,
half a billion in lost revenue--

19:19.159 --> 19:20.744
It was a training exercise.

19:20.827 --> 19:25.374
If a pilot crashes a simulator,
he doesn't then brush it off and go,

19:25.457 --> 19:27.918
"Well, I'm sorry.
It was a fucking exercise,"

19:28.001 --> 19:31.255
and then expect to be
put behind the wheel of a 747.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.508
-It's not the same thing.
-No, it's worse, you tit.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.097
-You're gonna do this every day then?
-If I didn't hate the sight of you,

19:40.180 --> 19:42.891
I'd come to your home
and do it at the weekends too.

19:43.934 --> 19:48.063
I am surrounded by fuckups
in this building,

19:48.146 --> 19:50.190
but you are the gold standard of fuckups.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.651
By all rights, you shouldn't even be here.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.029
You should've skipped this purgatory
and gone straight to hell.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.322
Melted you down for glue.

19:57.406 --> 20:01.201
But you avoided that
because your name is Cartwright.

20:01.285 --> 20:04.705
So when you wonder why I have you
going through the rubbish

20:04.788 --> 20:08.000
of a disgraced right-wing journo,
wonder no more.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.254
It's because I don't like you.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.840
And I want you to quit.

20:17.509 --> 20:20.387
I'll just get back to
retching then, shall I?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.474
Nice one, Sid.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.228
Standish! Flashbox.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.649
-Is this Hobden's?
-It's mine.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.193
He has a USB stick on his key ring.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.653
I distracted him
and copied the contents onto here.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.280
Well, he notice?

20:38.363 --> 20:40.199
Never looked at his keys,
never looked at my laptop.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.743
You see, Cartwright. She is a good agent.

20:42.826 --> 20:46.663
And this is why I put Sid on surveillance
and not you.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.041
You still want me to itemize his rubbish,
though, do you?

20:49.124 --> 20:51.335
That? Oh, yeah, yeah.
And when you're done,

20:51.418 --> 20:53.337
save me the bother
and chuck it all in the bin.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.547
What was on the stick?

20:55.631 --> 20:57.090
I don't know. It's not my remit.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.551
What do you mean not your--
Just tell me what was on the stick.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.136
Hey, I've got a call to make,

21:01.220 --> 21:03.639
so if the pair of you wouldn't mind,
you know, fucking off.

21:09.645 --> 21:10.938
Get me Lady Di.

21:11.563 --> 21:14.525
-Why did he have us both on Hobden?
-Well, you weren't really on him.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.110
No, but two agents
on a has-been journalist.

21:17.194 --> 21:19.071
That just-- It just feels like overkill.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.406
Especially when we don't run ops
from Slough House.

21:21.490 --> 21:23.992
Apparently, we do, River. Or I do.

21:24.076 --> 21:26.328
-You never call me River.
-I never call anyone River.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.830
Yeah, well, thank my mother.
It was her hippie phase.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.332
I got what you wanted.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.084
All of it?

21:32.876 --> 21:36.421
There was nothing in the rubbish,
but we got his laptop files.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.591
You sending a courier?

21:39.675 --> 21:41.552
I'm not gonna waste
one of my grown-up spies.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.011
Send one of your donkeys.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.764
Okay, but
I can't guarantee it'll get there.

21:45.848 --> 21:48.183
Send Sid Baker. She's the most capable.

21:48.267 --> 21:50.269
Oh, you mean the least shit?

21:51.520 --> 21:54.898
And just to be clear, Diana,
you owe me.

21:54.982 --> 21:57.317
Whatever you say, Jackson.

21:57.401 --> 21:59.361
Who's it going to?

22:05.909 --> 22:07.703
Are you gonna clean this rubbish up?

22:09.162 --> 22:11.373
No, I thought I'd just leave it there.

22:12.416 --> 22:15.085
Yes. Of course I'm gonna clean it up.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.170
When?

22:16.753 --> 22:19.464
When you give me a chance.
I've literally just sat down.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.842
Okay, well, here's your chance.
I'm going for a coffee.

22:22.759 --> 22:23.969
You've already had a coffee.

22:24.803 --> 22:26.722
I'm allowed more than one. I'm a big girl.

22:28.599 --> 22:30.267
The gloves really suit you, by the way.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.603
-Taking the piss, is it?
-I wouldn't know where to start.

22:33.437 --> 22:34.438
Bye.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.747
I was thumping for Sid.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.457
Sid's gone for coffee.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.336
No, she's already had coffee.
She was getting away from you.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.422
Failure's contagious.

23:01.798 --> 23:02.883
Deliver this.

23:04.218 --> 23:05.219
Where?

23:05.302 --> 23:06.803
Regent's Park.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.390
Oh, so this Hobden thing is Regent's Park?

23:10.974 --> 23:14.811
Yeah, of course it bloody is.
We don't run ops from Slough House.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.606
Why would they get us to do it?

23:19.650 --> 23:21.151
And why do they want me to deliver it?

23:21.235 --> 23:24.530
They don't. They want Sid,
but she's not here, so I'm sending you.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.448
Who's the contact?

23:30.285 --> 23:31.411
Webb.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.832
Isn't he an old mate of yours?

23:43.257 --> 23:44.800
Don't leave it on the bus.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.182
Fuck!

24:58.916 --> 25:00.334
Go straight. On the right.

25:20.854 --> 25:24.149
Hi. River Cartwright delivering
for James Webb.

25:29.530 --> 25:30.948
You are with…

25:31.573 --> 25:33.867
MI5. Same as you.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.744
You're not showing up.

25:39.790 --> 25:40.958
I'm over at Aldersgate.

25:41.834 --> 25:42.876
Aldersgate?

25:44.837 --> 25:46.088
Slough House.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.717
You'll need a visitor's pass.
Look into here.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.278
Thank you.

26:14.533 --> 26:17.995
Sorry. Can you sit over there?
You have to wait for an escort.

26:53.155 --> 26:54.156
This way.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.377
Come.

27:12.257 --> 27:14.259
River. Didn't know it'd be you.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.143
Let's not make this awkward.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.187
Has someone thrown up on your tie?

27:25.270 --> 27:28.899
Okay, awkward it is.
It's Karl Unger, peasant.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.401
Cut yourself shaving as well.
That's annoying.

27:31.485 --> 27:34.112
Yeah. Well, technically it wasn't me.

27:34.196 --> 27:36.865
I get a wet shave most mornings
at Truefitt &amp; Hill.

27:36.949 --> 27:38.200
Truefitt &amp; Hill.

27:40.244 --> 27:41.954
Keep a lot of hard copy in here,
don't you?

27:42.037 --> 27:43.330
Bit above your pay grade, mate.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.086
-Oh, my God. You're in HR.
-It's not HR. It's vetting.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.672
Call it what you like. It's still not
really being an agent, is it?

27:51.755 --> 27:52.756
Laptop.

27:56.635 --> 27:57.761
What's this? No flashbox?

27:57.845 --> 28:00.681
No. I've heard of those but,
I mean, it's Slough House.

28:00.764 --> 28:02.432
Frankly,
I'm amazed we've still got Jiffy bags.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.268
You want this back?

28:05.769 --> 28:07.437
Are you ever gonna admit that
you made a mistake?

28:08.605 --> 28:09.565
-Yeah.
-Still on that.

28:09.648 --> 28:11.275
"Blue shirt, white tee."
That's what you said.

28:11.358 --> 28:14.069
You fucked up. Yes, you did. Not me, you.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.571
And you let me take the fall.

28:15.654 --> 28:18.699
Own your mistakes, River.
Stansted was your fiasco.

28:18.782 --> 28:21.159
Well, I mean, I get it.
I was clearly Taverner's favorite.

28:21.243 --> 28:22.995
-Really?
-Yeah, and that really annoyed you,

28:23.078 --> 28:24.705
really got under your skin, didn't it?

28:24.788 --> 28:28.292
So you not only covered for your fiasco,
you got me out of the way.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.085
It's always about you, isn't it?

28:30.169 --> 28:32.337
What about the people who lost
their lives and limbs?

28:32.421 --> 28:34.381
-It wasn't real.
-What is this then?

28:34.464 --> 28:37.885
Other than a new training module entitled,
"How to avoid a fucking fiasco."

28:37.968 --> 28:39.761
It did-- Fuck off. It wasn't a--

28:39.845 --> 28:43.557
He's dead. She's dead. Injured. Dead.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.350
-Maimed, that one.
-No. Actor.

28:45.434 --> 28:47.811
-Mortally injured. Maimed. He's dying.
-Actor.

28:47.895 --> 28:50.647
It was a training exercise.

28:50.731 --> 28:55.277
Yeah. It was. It was an exercise,
but if it had been real, they'd have died.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.573
You fucked up. Massively.
Un-fucking-forgivably.

29:00.449 --> 29:03.535
And you did genuinely
injure some of them. Wait, where is it?

29:04.828 --> 29:06.997
I love this bit. It's my favorite.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.959
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Painful.

29:12.169 --> 29:13.295
He won't dance again.

29:13.378 --> 29:16.465
Yeah, well, there's no lives in your hands
here in HR, is there?

29:16.548 --> 29:20.093
Yeah, and what have you got in your hands
at Slough House apart from your dick?

29:21.386 --> 29:22.930
Escort.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.723
You know why they call it Slough House?

29:24.806 --> 29:27.935
Yes. But I imagine you're gonna tell me
what it is. Yeah, why not?

29:28.018 --> 29:30.604
It's because, while it may only be
three miles from where I sit,

29:30.687 --> 29:33.857
it is so far from the beating heart
of the service

29:33.941 --> 29:35.317
it might as well be in Slough.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.111
Yeah, if you have to explain a joke,
it's 'cause it's not working.

29:38.195 --> 29:39.905
I heard your grandfather…

29:40.781 --> 29:43.367
he had to pull whatever strings
he still had access to

29:43.450 --> 29:45.077
to stop you being kicked out altogether.

29:47.079 --> 29:50.791
That must've hurt him.
Having to beg for his grandson like that.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.386
Fuck you, Spider.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.888
-This is a professional work environment.
-Right.

30:04.972 --> 30:06.098
I don't go by that anymore.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.933
Okay. Thanks, Spider.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.768
-He's all done here. Show him out.
-Thanks, Spider.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.770
He loves being called that,
by the way. Spider.

30:11.854 --> 30:12.938
Never call me that.

30:16.984 --> 30:19.361
Excuse me! Your pass.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.807
This is everything from today.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.984
What did your last servant die of?

31:01.486 --> 31:04.323
What did your last boss die of?

31:52.037 --> 31:53.830
-Good night.
-Yep.

31:54.748 --> 31:55.832
Fucking hell.

31:59.253 --> 32:03.382
Anybody fancy a swift half, hey?
Or better still, a slow pint?

32:04.341 --> 32:06.885
I've got a friend coming over.
I can't tonight.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.887
I better get back to the family.

32:08.971 --> 32:12.641
So? Text them
that you're busy saving the nation.

32:12.724 --> 32:15.936
I like to be there for the kids' bedtime,
but, you know, another evening.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.729
But you always say that.

32:18.313 --> 32:20.065
-Well, maybe tomorrow.
-Tomorrow then.

32:20.148 --> 32:22.150
-Louisa, tomorrow?
-Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

32:22.234 --> 32:24.278
It's a date. Laters.

32:45.215 --> 32:48.427
We hang our heads
when they should be held up high.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.888
We stuck two fingers up at the Luftwaffe,

32:50.971 --> 32:56.560
yet we can't stop these people
crossing the Channel, the English Channel,

32:56.643 --> 32:58.228
in their rubber dinghies.

32:58.312 --> 33:01.190
Get out the Navy, I say. The Royal Navy.

33:01.273 --> 33:04.735
Whatever it takes to keep Britain British.

33:07.154 --> 33:08.947
-Fuck.
-How long have you been here?

33:09.031 --> 33:10.949
-What?
-You look like a mole.

33:12.075 --> 33:13.160
A mole?

33:13.785 --> 33:15.662
Are you a closet nationalist now?

33:15.746 --> 33:17.998
-Oh, no. I found it in Hobden's rubbish.
-River.

33:18.081 --> 33:20.709
Yes. Yes, I know.
I still need to clean up.

33:20.792 --> 33:24.213
Just ended up down
a pretty dark rabbit hole.

33:24.296 --> 33:26.381
All rabbit holes are dark.
They're underground.

33:27.257 --> 33:30.010
-Thanks.
-What's this?

33:30.761 --> 33:32.304
Greg Simmonds. You know him?

33:32.387 --> 33:34.515
Yeah. Sleazy businessman
who can't get over the fact

33:34.598 --> 33:35.974
Britain won a war 70 years ago.

33:36.058 --> 33:39.311
A war that he seems to think was actually
fought against ethnic minorities

33:39.394 --> 33:43.148
and political correctness
rather than the Nazis. Yeah.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.067
Yeah.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.194
You ever listen
to one of his speeches?

33:49.613 --> 33:52.407
These immigrants
say they don't like our religion.

33:52.491 --> 33:54.535
They don't like our way of life.

33:55.619 --> 33:58.747
And yet it's us that get arrested
by our own police force

33:58.830 --> 34:01.667
for saying the wrong things.
For telling jokes.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.377
I tell you, this is a war--

34:03.460 --> 34:05.671
Yeah.
I can't take any more of that.

34:05.754 --> 34:09.591
MI5 reckon that he has been funding
a lot of these new hate groups.

34:10.384 --> 34:12.761
Spends his time rubbing shoulders
with politicians

34:12.844 --> 34:14.804
while immigrants have
their homes burned down.

34:14.888 --> 34:18.433
I'm not sure this is a great way to be
spending your spare time.

34:19.101 --> 34:20.853
You've seen my work on the floor.

34:20.936 --> 34:24.982
Oh, cry me a river, River.
No, seriously, as a friend--

34:25.065 --> 34:28.025
As a friend? Are we friends?

34:28.110 --> 34:30.862
I don't think I'm ready to make that kind
of commitment, to be honest with you.

34:30.946 --> 34:34.074
Look, what I'm seeing right now
is just not good for your dating profile.

34:34.157 --> 34:35.576
What are you? My dating coach?

34:35.659 --> 34:37.995
Absolutely not. That'd be a full-time job.

34:38.078 --> 34:41.331
All right. You're here after hours.
What's your excuse?

34:41.415 --> 34:43.000
I left my phone charger.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.918
A phone charger. You came all the way back
for a phone charger?

34:46.003 --> 34:48.380
-I was having drinks nearby.
-Well, thanks for the invite.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.425
I've invited you before
and you turned me down.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.509
-What? No--
-Once bitten…

34:52.592 --> 34:53.886
-No, you haven't.
-Yes, I have.

34:53.969 --> 34:55.179
No. It--

34:57.139 --> 34:58.432
Fucking hell.

34:58.515 --> 35:02.603
If people are happy to spend time
in this building after 5:00 p.m.,

35:03.520 --> 35:05.981
then I'm not really doing my job.

35:07.983 --> 35:09.401
I left my phone charger.

35:09.943 --> 35:11.987
I was gonna clean up the rubbish. Sorry.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.115
Fuck off.

35:16.241 --> 35:19.578
"Fuck off" as in go home,
or "fuck off" as in you don't believe us?

35:20.078 --> 35:25.083
At the end of the working day,
your pitiful, miserable time is your own.

35:26.126 --> 35:32.382
But if I find out you are indulging
in extracurricular activities

35:32.466 --> 35:36.970
that could upset the equilibrium
of this blessed sanctuary,

35:38.138 --> 35:42.726
then I will make it so that
you wish you were in a Siberian gulag.

36:09.795 --> 36:11.171
Twice in one day.

36:11.755 --> 36:14.800
That girl earlier.
The one who spilled my coffee.

36:14.883 --> 36:17.302
Did she leave soon after me?

36:17.386 --> 36:20.264
I can't remember. I think so.

36:21.306 --> 36:23.475
Well, has she been in here before?

36:23.559 --> 36:24.852
A few times recently.

36:26.270 --> 36:30.524
Oh, yeah. Well, if she comes in again…

36:33.569 --> 36:34.778
give me a call.

36:35.487 --> 36:36.572
-Yeah?
-Sure.

36:48.625 --> 36:49.751
Dirty old man.

37:23.202 --> 37:27.331
Yeah, looking back I probably
already had a drinking problem.

37:27.414 --> 37:33.420
But, when my dad died,
I just got really, really lost.

37:33.504 --> 37:36.965
He was 56. Aneurysm. Gone.

37:38.175 --> 37:40.135
Yeah, it totally upended me.

37:41.803 --> 37:44.681
I started suffering from blackouts.

37:44.765 --> 37:46.767
Charles.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.602
Morning, Charles.

37:49.186 --> 37:52.523
…couldn't be with me
unless I got sober. So I did.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.859
But I did it more for my dad's memory.

37:55.943 --> 37:57.110
Charles?

37:58.904 --> 37:59.905
Charles?

38:08.997 --> 38:10.249
Charles.

38:14.127 --> 38:15.128
Charles.

38:16.964 --> 38:17.965
Charles.

38:21.718 --> 38:22.803
Catherine.

38:22.886 --> 38:25.055
Catherine. You haven't spoken.

38:27.724 --> 38:30.352
My name's Catherine. I'm an alcoholic.

38:30.435 --> 38:31.937
Hi, Catherine.

38:32.521 --> 38:34.064
I'll just listen tonight.

39:23.030 --> 39:24.698
You know
you left the front door open?

39:24.781 --> 39:25.908
I saw you driving up.

39:26.575 --> 39:28.535
Are you sure you didn't leave it
open by mistake?

39:32.831 --> 39:34.166
I prepared a second piece.

39:39.546 --> 39:40.672
You can cook.

39:42.508 --> 39:44.760
Have you heard
from your mother recently?

39:46.678 --> 39:50.140
Yeah.
A postcard from Istanbul of all places.

39:51.517 --> 39:54.728
She's opening a guesthouse
with her current boyfriend.

39:56.104 --> 39:57.814
And you're out of lemons.

39:57.898 --> 40:01.652
Yeah, well, that plan will have changed
by the time the card arrived.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.362
Yeah. Boyfriend too, knowing her.

40:04.321 --> 40:07.324
You know,
I always expected her to turn up here

40:07.407 --> 40:09.618
with a KGB spook on her arm.

40:11.286 --> 40:13.413
That would have been
the ultimate rebellion.

40:13.497 --> 40:14.998
No. This is--
It's as hard as an egg, this.

40:15.082 --> 40:16.500
You know they keep better in the fridge.

40:16.583 --> 40:19.086
I always understood a lemon
could last as long

40:19.169 --> 40:20.921
as an 18th century naval voyage.

40:21.004 --> 40:22.756
Yes. Well, this is the 21st century,

40:22.840 --> 40:26.176
so we can take full advantage of modern
food-preservation techniques.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, the chicken's burning.

40:29.388 --> 40:30.556
Shit.

40:30.639 --> 40:33.684
No, it's not, It's searing.
It's exactly the way I wanted it.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.567
Did you ever come across Robert Hobden?

40:43.610 --> 40:46.446
So you didn't visit me
just to lecture me

40:46.530 --> 40:49.157
on home safety and food hygiene.

40:49.241 --> 40:52.911
-No. I wanted to see you too. I did.
-Not wanted to see me that much lately.

40:52.995 --> 40:57.124
Yeah. Well, not really been that much
to report, has there? From Slough House.

40:57.207 --> 40:59.293
They won't keep you there forever.

40:59.835 --> 41:02.129
I was given the impression
that they probably will.

41:02.212 --> 41:03.755
Well, that's the point.

41:03.839 --> 41:06.675
If you knew it was for only six months,
it wouldn't hurt.

41:06.758 --> 41:08.969
Yeah. It's been eight months.

41:09.052 --> 41:13.640
Well, you do your time. Whatever
grunt work Jackson Lamb throws your way.

41:13.724 --> 41:17.519
Then you head back to Regent's Park.
Your sins forgiven.

41:17.603 --> 41:20.147
Lamb's been there years,
so they've obviously never forgiven him.

41:20.230 --> 41:21.732
The man practically lives there.

41:21.815 --> 41:24.902
Was he ever actually good?
I can't imagine it.

41:26.486 --> 41:27.487
I'll lay the table.

41:31.909 --> 41:35.996
You are not listening to me, Jack.
There is gonna be an attack.

41:36.079 --> 41:38.540
People are going to get hurt.

41:38.624 --> 41:41.335
I can't tell you any more
because I'll put myself at risk.

41:42.419 --> 41:45.839
No, no.
Forget about any fucking loyalty to me.

41:45.923 --> 41:47.758
Do this for your country.

41:51.470 --> 41:57.059
Fine. But know this.
There will be blood on your hands.

42:12.699 --> 42:14.660
You are coming tonight, aren't you?

42:14.743 --> 42:16.161
Of course I am.

42:16.245 --> 42:18.622
Good. 'Cause genuinely,
I might need backup.

42:18.705 --> 42:20.249
Have they started on you again?

42:20.832 --> 42:25.128
People are messaging the club
saying that they shouldn't book me.

42:25.212 --> 42:26.213
What?

42:26.296 --> 42:28.882
It's like you can't even say
the word "religion" now

42:28.966 --> 42:30.676
without somebody taking offense.

42:30.759 --> 42:33.220
-Yeah.
-My stuff isn't even that controversial.

42:33.303 --> 42:35.430
And the stuff that is was written by you.

42:36.014 --> 42:37.015
Yeah.

42:38.016 --> 42:39.726
Are you sure you just
don't wanna get up there?

42:40.477 --> 42:44.857
Look, I will sit in the audience
and confuse everybody

42:44.940 --> 42:48.235
by laughing loudly each time
you mention Muslims.

42:58.328 --> 42:59.663
Here you go.

43:01.248 --> 43:02.374
Thank you.

43:02.457 --> 43:04.001
So, what happened to your hand?

43:05.794 --> 43:07.129
Nothing. I burned it on a grill.

43:08.046 --> 43:09.882
Was there a flashbox in the grill?

43:13.468 --> 43:15.971
All right. Yes, I tried to open
a flashbox without the code.

43:16.054 --> 43:18.223
Stupid thing to do.
Have you had it seen to?

43:18.307 --> 43:20.434
No, no. It's fine.
It's nothing to worry about.

43:23.312 --> 43:24.479
What was in the box?

43:27.107 --> 43:30.944
A laptop.
With files taken from Robert Hobden.

43:31.904 --> 43:33.405
Anyone know you pulled this stunt?

43:33.488 --> 43:36.325
-No. No.
-Good. Good. Keep it that way.

43:36.909 --> 43:37.951
Yes.

43:40.078 --> 43:41.496
It's just strange. It's just--

43:41.580 --> 43:44.708
It's not the usual crap
they get you to do there in Slough House.

43:44.791 --> 43:48.712
It's-- I mean the Park are on it.
They're on Hobden.

43:48.795 --> 43:50.297
-Why?
-I don't know.

43:50.380 --> 43:51.757
That's what I was trying to find out.

43:54.009 --> 43:56.178
And I was hoping that you could
just tell me.

43:58.388 --> 43:59.556
Yeah, well…

44:01.892 --> 44:05.020
Hobden had had a run-in with MI5 before.

44:06.146 --> 44:08.023
He was a communist in his youth.

44:08.815 --> 44:13.987
Then he changed sides.
One-nation Tory, star columnist.

44:14.613 --> 44:17.074
Then the loathsome drift to the far right.

44:17.157 --> 44:19.618
His career ended when his name appeared

44:19.701 --> 44:23.789
on a leaked list of donors
to the British Patriotic Party.

44:23.872 --> 44:27.251
Hobden always claimed that it was MI5
that leaked the list.

44:28.168 --> 44:31.380
I can't comment, but if we didn't do it,
we should've done.

44:33.632 --> 44:36.051
Can't have fascists hiding in plain sight.

44:36.802 --> 44:39.847
But, I mean, he's no one.
The man's a has-been.

44:39.930 --> 44:41.765
I just don't understand
why they even bother looking at him.

44:41.849 --> 44:45.227
I've told you all I know,
and you should stay out of it.

44:45.310 --> 44:48.063
And if the Park are looking at him,
there'll be a good reason.

44:48.856 --> 44:50.941
And if they're using
Slough House to do it,

44:51.024 --> 44:52.943
it means they don't want blowback.

44:54.027 --> 44:56.071
Which puts you at risk.

44:59.116 --> 45:00.242
You understand?

45:02.452 --> 45:03.996
And remember… hmm?

45:06.582 --> 45:09.918
Moscow rules, watch your back.
London rules, cover your arse.

45:10.002 --> 45:11.503
-Yeah.
-Very good.

45:13.088 --> 45:16.133
How come every picture of Jesus

45:16.216 --> 45:18.802
has him looking like
a millennial gap year student?

45:20.053 --> 45:21.513
He-- He's got everything, right?

45:21.597 --> 45:25.809
He's got the likes of hipster,
long hair, the beard, the sandals.

45:25.893 --> 45:27.644
He looks like a sort of 35-year-old man

45:27.728 --> 45:29.855
who still thinks the band
is gonna make it big.

45:32.524 --> 45:36.361
So…
Jesus, Buddha and Allah walk into a pub.

45:38.864 --> 45:41.491
And the mood goes like that.

45:42.451 --> 45:43.535
Like this actually.

45:45.162 --> 45:49.082
And they-- they go to the bar.
They order drinks.

45:50.250 --> 45:54.254
Tap water for Jesus 'cause, you know,
he can turn that into wine for free.

45:54.838 --> 45:57.925
Diet Coke for Buddha because
he's watching his weight.

45:58.008 --> 46:01.136
And, alcohol-free beer for Allah.

46:01.887 --> 46:04.806
-Nah, I'm done with this.
-And, I'll-- Really?

46:04.890 --> 46:08.519
Don't worry about them, guys. Don't worry.
Just treat them like an STD.

46:08.602 --> 46:10.604
If you ignore them,
they'll probably go away.

46:12.356 --> 46:16.360
And let me tell you,
they had a lovely time.

46:16.443 --> 46:18.987
They really did.
Honestly, they stayed out all night.

46:19.071 --> 46:21.448
Jesus got crucified
and wasn't seen for three days.

46:23.825 --> 46:26.828
I don't know why you guys
were worr-- Why were you worried?

46:28.539 --> 46:31.792
Absolutely killed it tonight.
That was the best I've ever seen you.

46:32.543 --> 46:33.544
Hey, you were great.

46:33.627 --> 46:34.670
Oh, thank you.

46:34.753 --> 46:36.797
Hey, you were great.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.298
And you were so relaxed as well.

46:38.382 --> 46:42.052
Strongest material, though, is your
"Jesus, Buddha and Allah walk into a pub."

46:42.135 --> 46:43.929
You need to get up there.

46:45.264 --> 46:47.516
So you head-in
for the nine o'clock tomorrow?

46:48.267 --> 46:49.518
You gonna be in?

46:49.601 --> 46:50.811
Nine o'clock. Nope. No.

46:51.478 --> 46:53.063
-No way.
-All right, mate.

46:53.146 --> 46:54.439
I'll see you in the week, yeah?

46:54.523 --> 46:56.441
Okay. Take care, bro. Thank you so much.

46:57.150 --> 46:58.944
-You killed it.
-Killer work.

47:16.587 --> 47:19.131
Wait! Oi! Hey!

47:20.090 --> 47:22.676
No! No! No, no, no! No!

47:22.759 --> 47:25.721
Help! Help me!

48:09.097 --> 48:12.684
Roddy, can you… check something for me?

48:12.768 --> 48:16.021
Not on the clock yet.
You'll need to pay my private rate.

48:16.104 --> 48:17.105
Yep.

48:27.074 --> 48:29.201
Just tell what it is
I'm looking at on there.

48:32.371 --> 48:34.081
-Don't touch that!
-All right.

48:42.381 --> 48:43.382
It's pi.

48:44.883 --> 48:46.593
-Is that a code?
-No. It's pi.

48:46.677 --> 48:48.679
Running to an infinite number of places.

48:48.762 --> 48:51.473
Is there anything else behind it?
Any other files on the stick? Anything?

48:51.557 --> 48:52.724
No. Where'd you get it?

48:52.808 --> 48:53.809
Hobden.

48:56.061 --> 48:57.479
You copied the files.

48:57.980 --> 48:59.731
You'd only know that if you'd looked
at it yourself.

48:59.815 --> 49:01.650
Well, at least I didn't need Ho
to tell me it was pi.

49:01.733 --> 49:04.486
Everybody needs me.
They just don't know it.

49:05.028 --> 49:06.572
Seems like he used it as a decoy.

49:06.655 --> 49:09.533
He was expecting a snatch. Cool cat.

49:10.284 --> 49:12.536
Thanks, Roddy. Very helpful.

49:14.872 --> 49:16.832
Why would he be expecting a snatch?

49:16.915 --> 49:17.833
I don't know.

49:17.916 --> 49:20.669
What do you think the Park will do
if they find out you opened a flashbox?

49:20.752 --> 49:22.880
Yeah, well, they're not gonna find out,
are they?

49:26.425 --> 49:27.467
Did it hurt?

49:27.551 --> 49:30.095
No. Well, a bit.

49:31.805 --> 49:33.640
Fuck! Jesus Christ, Sid.

49:33.724 --> 49:35.434
Look, I know you landed here with a bump…

49:35.517 --> 49:38.187
-Yeah. I've still got whiplash.
-If you want to do something useful,

49:38.270 --> 49:40.314
you can get rid of the stinking rubbish
that's still in our office.

49:40.397 --> 49:43.192
Yeah, but I wanna actually be
properly useful, Sid. Don't you?

49:43.275 --> 49:48.071
Do something. I mean, it--
I could not be more bored if I tried, Sid.

49:48.155 --> 49:49.907
And I have actually tried.

49:49.990 --> 49:51.533
And if the Park are looking at Hobden,

49:51.617 --> 49:54.912
then that means there is something
finally happening here.

49:54.995 --> 49:57.080
Exactly. It's the Park's business,
not ours.

49:57.497 --> 49:59.499
Cartwright, come see this!

50:07.925 --> 50:09.551
-Following a breaking story…
-Hostage.

50:13.972 --> 50:15.015
Is it live?

50:15.098 --> 50:17.434
Popped up on a Middle East chat feed
a few hours ago.

50:17.518 --> 50:19.269
Media have just picked up on it.

50:19.353 --> 50:20.979
He's holding today's Express.

50:22.314 --> 50:23.899
Shit. He's being held here.

50:23.982 --> 50:27.277
What appears to be here
in the heart of Britain.

50:27.361 --> 50:30.948
…recording first surfaced
this morning on social media…

50:31.031 --> 50:33.534
What we really need now is leadership.

50:33.617 --> 50:36.328
Who's collating lists
on recently active groups?

50:36.411 --> 50:37.538
I am, ma'am.

50:37.621 --> 50:39.164
I wanted a breakdown of that
a half an hour ago.

50:39.248 --> 50:41.041
-Yes, ma'am.
-Home Office, ma'am.

50:41.124 --> 50:43.669
…and obsession with multiculturalism.

50:43.752 --> 50:46.421
We don't stand up for our values,

50:46.505 --> 50:49.174
which leads to this
horrific situation where

50:49.258 --> 50:53.512
Muslim fundamentalists
are bringing terror to our streets

50:53.595 --> 50:56.098
and threatening to murder our citizens.

50:56.181 --> 50:57.850
I don't think we should be watching this.

50:58.433 --> 50:59.893
What? The rest of the country is.

50:59.977 --> 51:02.020
Has anyone claimed responsibility yet?

51:02.104 --> 51:03.939
-No, no one.
-It would be ISIS, wouldn't it?

51:04.022 --> 51:05.649
Or one of their tribute groups.

51:06.149 --> 51:08.819
Well,
what the fuck's it got to do with you?

51:08.902 --> 51:13.615
Whatever's going on will be a job
for the real agents, not you fuckups.

51:13.699 --> 51:15.242
Yo, what's this?

51:15.325 --> 51:17.786
-Looks like a walking stick.
-Yeah, maybe he's been snatched

51:17.870 --> 51:19.830
by the Ramblers Association.

51:19.913 --> 51:21.707
No, it's an ax.

51:21.790 --> 51:24.126
-He's not white.
-That's why he was wearing gloves.

51:24.209 --> 51:26.044
-Fuck.
-Who's got him then?

51:26.128 --> 51:28.046
It could still be Islamists.
He could be a non-believer.

51:28.130 --> 51:30.132
-Maybe he's a squaddie.
-He doesn't look like a squaddie.

51:30.215 --> 51:33.218
Nah, he looks Pakistani,
which to them means Muslim.

51:33.302 --> 51:35.679
-To who?
-Oh, you people are slow.

51:36.346 --> 51:40.559
Bringing you up to speed
is like trying to explain Norway to a dog.

51:40.642 --> 51:44.396
It'll be right-wing nationalists.
That's who's got him.

51:44.479 --> 51:46.523
It's the Sons of Albion
who are taking credit.

51:46.607 --> 51:49.818
-Christ, I hate being right.
-All right, so what do we do then?

51:49.902 --> 51:52.571
What we always do here.
Absolutely nothing.

51:52.654 --> 51:56.158
Come on. Back to your desks.
Come on, all of you. Out!

51:59.119 --> 52:01.079
-Hobden.
-What?

52:01.747 --> 52:04.041
His old crew
was the British Patriotic Party.

52:04.124 --> 52:06.502
Yeah, but they splintered into factions.

52:06.585 --> 52:09.588
Yeah, but one of them might have
something to do with this. Him too.

52:10.339 --> 52:12.341
-Just leave it.
-News flash!

52:12.925 --> 52:14.343
You're gonna wanna check this out.

52:14.426 --> 52:16.261
We are following a breaking news story.

52:16.345 --> 52:19.389
Sunrise tomorrow,
they say they're gonna cut his head off.

52:20.057 --> 52:22.017
They're gonna strike a blow for Britain.

52:22.976 --> 52:26.355
This changes nothing. Come on. Out!

52:27.064 --> 52:30.400
You've all got papers to shuffle,
so why are you still in this room?

52:35.072 --> 52:38.283
Now, wait, all apologies.
Answer me one simple question.

52:38.951 --> 52:41.453
Where the fuck is River Cartwright?
