00:00.959 --> 00:02.127
Narrator:
<i>Previously on Recovery Road...</i>

00:02.127 --> 00:05.756
24 hours of detox and 90 days
at a sober‐living facility,

00:05.756 --> 00:07.424
and I won't
tell the headmaster.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.301
Hi, I'm Maddie.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.763
You can go to school by day
and spend your evenings
getting sober.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.139
Curfew is strictly enforced.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.184
We're old friends.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.521
Cynthia:
You're going to be
under constant supervision.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.481
‐Pretty.
‐My dad gave that to me.
He's dead.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.941
Craig:
<i>You and Maddie</i>
<i>can't happen.</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:24.983
I'm Cynthia.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.236
Don't you think
it's a little hypocritical
of you to call me out

00:27.236 --> 00:28.445
when you're an addict too?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.488
Nice to meet you.

00:29.488 --> 00:33.158
My ugly past
keeps coming back
to haunt me.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.206
Maddie:
<i>This is a tale</i>
<i>of two best friends,</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:43.043
<i>two years ago, too high</i>
<i>to know that their friendship</i>
<i>was about to take a big hit.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:45.003
(rock music playing)

00:47.005 --> 00:49.216
‐Oh, Maddie.
‐Uh‐huh?

00:49.216 --> 00:53.136
I only have $38 to my name.
How depressing is that?

00:55.347 --> 00:58.141
Now you're just bragging,
'cause I only have 14.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.602
It's time, Maddie.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.648
It's time for us
to become prostitutes.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.108
You totally
just read my mind.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.529
Dude, I mean, everyone
is gonna be going away
this summer,

01:10.529 --> 01:14.575
and we're gonna
be stuck here raiding
the couch cushions for cush.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.411
Actually, Luther's going away
to Amsterdam for the summer.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.329
‐What?
‐(mimics trombone)

01:19.329 --> 01:22.666
Even our drug dealer's life
is more exciting than ours.

01:22.666 --> 01:23.875
I have an idea.

01:23.875 --> 01:29.339
We break into Luther's house,
steal his stash,

01:29.339 --> 01:31.800
and then we sell it.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.343
I'm so into this idea.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.928
Wait. It gets better.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.973
We blame it on
a Czechoslovakian cartel.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.976
Okay, well, that's gonna be
hard to do, babe,

01:40.976 --> 01:43.979
because that's not even
a place anymore.
It's the new Pluto.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.647
(mimicking
Eastern European accent)
Forgive me.

01:45.647 --> 01:49.776
I'm a geographically‐challenged
drug lord.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.904
You know...

01:55.198 --> 01:56.616
we could sell my Ritalin.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.538
(person approaching)

02:04.541 --> 02:06.209
Seriously,
where do you buy these?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.003
GuidanceCounselorPosters.com?

02:08.003 --> 02:09.338
Good morning
to you, too, Maddie.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.797
It is not
a good morning.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.716
In fact, this morning sucks
big, fat...

02:12.716 --> 02:15.093
Do not finish that sentence.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.304
Now, let's take a deep breath,
start from the beginning.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.014
It pretty much
started to go south

02:19.014 --> 02:20.432
from when
I acquired consciousness.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.143
<i>I woke up to find</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:25.687
<i>the figurine my dad gave me</i>
<i>when I was a little girl,</i>
<i>was gone.</i>

02:27.230 --> 02:29.024
Trish, get up!

02:29.024 --> 02:30.651
<i>I very calmly and politely</i>

02:30.651 --> 02:32.569
<i>asked my roommate</i>
<i>what had happened to it,</i>

02:32.569 --> 02:33.987
<i>and she had no idea.</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:37.074
<i>So, yeah. People at</i>
<i>Springtime Meadows steal.</i>
<i>Shocker.</i>

02:37.074 --> 02:39.201
Well, I'm sure
there's a perfectly
logical explanation

02:39.201 --> 02:41.495
as to what happened
to your figurine.
And I'm sure it'll turn up.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.914
And Rebecca was being
a total bitch at breakfast.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.084
And‐‐ and...

02:47.084 --> 02:51.088
<i>my friends were acting</i>
<i>super weird around me.</i>

02:51.088 --> 02:52.756
Maddie, it may
feel that way, but...

02:52.756 --> 02:54.007
How could they not be?

02:54.007 --> 02:57.636
I didn't talk to one person
this whole entire weekend.

02:57.636 --> 02:58.720
Do you get
how weird that is?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.055
Because I don't have my phone.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.350
And since my curfew
corresponds with the first spin
on <i>Wheel of Fortune,</i>

03:03.350 --> 03:06.812
it's only a matter of time
before everyone realizes
that something is up.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.022
Ugh! This is a nightmare.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.982
The best thing
you can do right now
is focus on your sobriety.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.652
And make my life
even bleaker and less fun
than it already is?

03:13.652 --> 03:14.695
No, thanks.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.280
Hey, being sober and having fun
are not mutually exclusive.
In fact...

03:17.280 --> 03:19.866
How could I possibly
expect you to understand?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.119
What constitutes
a fun night for you?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.665
Doing Kegels
and watching Oprah's
online manifestation class?

03:26.665 --> 03:29.960
Giving yourself
a mayonnaise facial and
talking to your imaginary dog?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.920
Organizing your
Paula Abdul jewelry?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.713
Bingo! How did you know?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.923
I have no idea...

03:36.133 --> 03:39.136
how I'm gonna
make it through the next
two and a half months.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.972
No one can find out
that I'm in this place.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.141
Look, I get
what you're going through.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.351
The first weeks of sobriety
are very challenging.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.979
No, sobriety is not
challenging.

03:48.979 --> 03:53.984
Living away from home
with no phone and a curfew,
that is what's challenging.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.027
The first weeks of sobriety
are challenging,

03:56.027 --> 03:58.738
which is presently
why you're behaving
very aggressively.

03:58.738 --> 04:03.076
But the most effective
way to combat that is
with some structure.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.745
So, this is what
we are going to do.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.498
You are going to
create a list of goals
for the day.

04:08.498 --> 04:13.211
<i>It's a tool that will</i>
<i>help you feel more centered</i>
<i>and in control of things,</i>

04:13.211 --> 04:15.297
<i>and we'll discuss it</i>
<i>in the car after school.</i>

04:51.416 --> 04:54.085
(theme music playing)

04:54.961 --> 04:59.716
<i>♪ This time is my own time,</i>
<i>so step aside ♪</i>

04:59.716 --> 05:00.926
Rebecca:
So, then, my mom...

05:02.052 --> 05:03.094
and my whole family...

05:06.389 --> 05:09.017
said that that they can't
talk to me anymore.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.936
I was on speaker.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.062
And they all agreed.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.815
It's too hard for them.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.193
They're angry

05:18.193 --> 05:20.695
and too depleted.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.199
That is the word
that my sister used.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.788
She's too "depleted" to even
think that I'll ever be okay.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.872
That I won't

05:31.998 --> 05:34.251
just end up
right back here again.

05:37.170 --> 05:37.963
Okay.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.005
(sighs)

05:40.924 --> 05:41.925
Your...

05:43.093 --> 05:46.388
Your family, they're having
a hard time being empathetic
to your struggle.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.559
That's human nature.

05:50.559 --> 05:56.022
And even though it seems
as if they're shutting the door
on you right now,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.024
I'd encourage you
not to shut the door on them.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.778
Sometimes people
just need a...

06:01.778 --> 06:03.029
(sighs)

06:05.991 --> 06:06.992
No.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.204
No. They're being jerks.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.457
They are. And it sucks.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.668
And it's wrong,
and it's unfair.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.337
And it's exactly what
you don't need right now.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.882
But, hey, listen to me.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.509
Don't you dare ever change you

06:24.509 --> 06:27.262
and who you are
and where you're going.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.143
You're crushing it, Becks!
You are.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.687
Hey, you almost done?

06:40.525 --> 06:42.485
‐(whispers) Yeah?
‐Yeah.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.196
Yeah. He's all yours.

06:49.117 --> 06:49.993
Thank you, Craig.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.163
Hey.

07:27.947 --> 07:28.990
(sighing)

07:38.917 --> 07:41.378
So I was thinking
I'm going to get an apartment
just for the two of us,

07:41.378 --> 07:43.296
that has a swimming pool,
like on <i>The Hills.</i>

07:43.296 --> 07:46.216
And I was also thinking,
maybe I should homeschool her
while she's auditioning...

07:46.216 --> 07:47.676
Yeah. I...

07:49.052 --> 07:52.430
You're making
tremendous progress, Trish.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.641
But there's an awful lot
that has to happen

07:54.641 --> 07:56.726
before you're ready
to get your daughter back.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.186
Like what?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.855
I think a year sober
would be a good benchmark.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.941
And have you thought
about how you're gonna
pay for all this?

08:02.941 --> 08:06.194
I mean, fighting for custody
and raising a child,
it's not cheap.

08:06.194 --> 08:10.031
You really need to think harder
about getting a job.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.162
You've got to
get your phone back, Mad,
it's killing me.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.038
Killing you?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.707
Yes. I text you
20 times a day!

08:18.707 --> 08:19.791
Try 50.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.918
Exactly my point.
Nobody else wants to
hear my jokes,

08:21.918 --> 08:23.962
or see selfies
of me working out
or eating burritos or...

08:23.962 --> 08:26.005
I don't recall
asking for those, either.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.801
Seriously, though,
when are you getting
your phone back?

08:29.801 --> 08:33.263
Before the end of days,
but not before
this weekend.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.014
That's all I've got
in terms of a time‐frame.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.975
Since when does
your mom care if you get a "C"
on a Calculus test?

08:36.975 --> 08:39.561
Let's just say she's taking
a more active interest
in my life these days.

08:39.561 --> 08:43.106
Hello. I have
a delightfully salacious
piece of intel for you.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.984
Mr. Von Straaten
being a furry
is old news.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.736
Better.
It's better than that.

08:47.736 --> 08:52.657
But before we let you in
on this little secret,
we must travel.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.160
‐Who's driving?
‐I'm down. Let's go.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.997
I can't.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.875
I promised I'd be home
after school.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.876
For what?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.050
I've got nothing. Let's go.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.927
You just trust me.
Trust me. It's worth it.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.012
(laughter)

09:20.185 --> 09:21.478
(reggae music playing)

09:27.150 --> 09:28.151
What are you doing?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.198
Hey! Aren't you guys
in my class?

09:35.617 --> 09:36.868
Which one?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.119
Psychology.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.162
With Colker?

09:39.162 --> 09:40.789
Yeah! Yeah!

09:40.789 --> 09:42.207
Yeah, I'm in that class.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.000
I knew
you looked familiar.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.169
What's your name again?
It starts with a "J," right?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.546
It's Tobias.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.673
Tobias! Right!

09:50.673 --> 09:53.259
T‐Dawg! T‐Bird! Sweet T!

09:55.261 --> 09:56.262
So...

09:57.263 --> 09:58.640
do you guys like to get high?

09:58.640 --> 10:02.310
(rock music playing)

10:14.572 --> 10:16.282
(whispering)
Wow. This was all just
from that one guy?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.993
Hey, he's throwing
some big frat party
or something.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.328
Amazing.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.831
Now that our work
is done for the day,

10:22.831 --> 10:24.207
we can play.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.418
‐What are these?
‐Oxy.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.547
Isn't it ironic that
the girl who sells uppers
loves downers?

10:30.547 --> 10:31.881
You know what?
I take that back.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.842
I'm an equal opportunity
ingester.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.301
Why are you taking Oxy?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.303
I don't know.
Why do you toke
before gym class?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.305
Do you want it or not?

10:40.557 --> 10:43.101
Beck, I think
we've made enough.
We should probably stop.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.186
‐What?
‐I mean,
things are getting...

10:45.186 --> 10:48.064
No way.
We finally have enough
for the plane tickets.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.150
But where are we gonna stay?

10:50.150 --> 10:53.444
There's no way
our parents are gonna let us
go to Mexico by ourselves.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.822
Maddie, come on.
We can do this.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.701
We're being so careful

10:59.701 --> 11:02.579
and smart and efficient

11:02.579 --> 11:04.205
and organized
about all of it.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.415
Well, yeah...

11:05.415 --> 11:07.667
Okay, so stop worrying.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.252
We've got this.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.295
Trust me.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.965
Okay, don't laugh.
But I made a spreadsheet.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.635
Of course you did.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.099
Okay. Never have I ever...

11:24.434 --> 11:27.103
This is hard for me.
Once you've ticked off

11:27.103 --> 11:28.354
heroin,

11:28.354 --> 11:30.190
assault,

11:30.190 --> 11:31.482
and public nudity
at a Cinnabon...

11:32.859 --> 11:34.068
the game
kind of shuts down.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.528
It seems like it's
the really innocent things

11:35.528 --> 11:37.197
that are the things
we've never done.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.406
Sorry.

11:38.406 --> 11:42.994
Okay. Never have I ever
told anyone my middle name.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.456
Seriously? Never?

11:46.456 --> 11:47.916
Yeah. It's like I‐‐

11:47.916 --> 11:51.085
I just can't seem
to get it out of my mouth.
It's awful. Trust me.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.087
What's yours?

11:53.087 --> 11:54.130
McDowell.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.507
Rebecca McDowell Granger?

11:56.507 --> 11:58.509
‐Fancy.
‐Generations of fancy.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.347
I was set to inherit
the monogrammed silver,

12:02.347 --> 12:04.599
but instead I ended up here.

12:04.599 --> 12:08.102
The family was thinking
Princeton and law school,

12:08.102 --> 12:10.021
but a career
in concessions is close.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.314
Hey, hey, hey.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.609
Anyone that doesn't see
the value of a job
with popcorn benefits

12:15.652 --> 12:17.153
ain't worth worrying about.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.031
Wait for it.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.243
Look who we found.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.541
Look.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.378
Rebecca.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.588
You work here.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.092
Yeah.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.009
I work here.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.304
(whispers)
This is messed up.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.639
You signed off on this?

12:44.639 --> 12:46.766
Benji:
They made me.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.434
Hi. I'm Ellie.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.603
Hey.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.438
This is my friend, Wes.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.651
Have you met Wes?

13:00.154 --> 13:02.240
No. I don't think so.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.163
‐Nice to meet you...
‐Maddie.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.164
Maddie.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.793
Mad Dog Maddie.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.461
What have you been up to?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.046
Same ol' same ol'.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.340
Really?
And they still let you
roam the streets.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.803
You look good, Rebecca.
Are you...

13:23.803 --> 13:25.763
Sober? Yeah, I am.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.973
I have 218 days.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.351
I was gonna say "happy."

13:30.351 --> 13:31.352
Happy?

13:32.437 --> 13:34.022
Well, then I guess
I am happy.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.649
How about you, Maddie?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.069
Are you happy?

13:45.199 --> 13:49.746
Right, but we're
in limbo until we get
those building permits.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.914
I'm frustrated, too,
trust me.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.086
I know.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.171
I know.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.632
Believe me.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.844
You're not wrong, Phil.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.220
I have so much time
on my hands,

14:06.220 --> 14:08.973
I don't know
what to do with myself,
it's awful.

14:08.973 --> 14:09.974
Really.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.604
Phil, I'm gonna
call you right back.
Okay, sounds good.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.357
‐Bri!
‐Charlotte Graham.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.319
Oh, my God!
You look sensational.
I hate you.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.322
You look sensational.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.033
‐Did you...
‐Can you tell?
God, I hope so.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.367
They look fabulous.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.078
How are you?
How's Maddie?

14:32.371 --> 14:36.167
She's really good.
She's really,
really good, Bri.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.668
Yeah. She's buckled down.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.462
She's doing a lot
of volunteering,

14:39.462 --> 14:41.255
she's getting
really good grades.

14:41.255 --> 14:45.468
I mean, there was a point
when I was worried that,
you know, she lacked focus,

14:45.468 --> 14:48.304
but she's really stepped up
to the plate and...

14:49.764 --> 14:52.266
She's just really...
thriving.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.978
I couldn't be more proud.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.106
If Jason can manage to make it
through his teen years

14:58.106 --> 15:00.316
without getting
a girl knocked up,
I'll be proud.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.903
But it sounds
like you don't have
anything to worry about.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.947
Maddie's always been
such a good kid.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.032
She is.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.785
Let's go get facials.
Or a drink! Or 12.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.511
(Cynthia sighing)

15:32.807 --> 15:35.017
Maddie, it's Miss Moli...

15:35.017 --> 15:37.353
Cynthia. Where are you?

15:37.353 --> 15:40.773
You're supposed to be
in front of school and
I'm supposed to drive you...

15:40.773 --> 15:43.067
You don't have your phone.
Never mind.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.404
I'm not happy.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.123
Oh, my God.
It's essentially
rubbernecking.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.166
What do you mean?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.876
Like, when you drive past
a car accident

15:59.876 --> 16:01.377
or a really bad
train wreck or something,

16:01.377 --> 16:03.462
and you can't help
but stare.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.590
Your bloodlust
is touching.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.384
A little <i>schadenfreude</i>
never hurt nobody.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.553
Ritalin Rebecca.
You guys, come on.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.513
We've all wondered
what happened
to Little Miss Perfect.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.057
I heard that she was
whoring for heroin
on the streets,

16:15.057 --> 16:17.059
but it's even worse.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.188
She sells popcorn
at a movie theater.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.822
What happened?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.657
She got caught
selling drugs
in the girl's bathroom.

16:41.542 --> 16:46.172
Remind me again why
we are watching this lame
movie from the mid‐'90s?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.548
Because you brought us here.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.966
Yes, I did.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.849
What is that?

16:58.309 --> 17:01.187
‐Champagne cocktail.
‐Yes.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.690
No. It's a half an inch
off the top of every bottle

17:04.690 --> 17:06.567
on the first row
of my dad's liquor cabinet.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.527
‐Seriously?
‐Since when do you care?

17:08.527 --> 17:11.155
I've seen you lick coke
off the ladies room floor.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.343
Alcohol is not permitted
in the theater,

17:32.343 --> 17:33.844
so I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.973
You're kidding, right?

17:36.973 --> 17:38.057
I'm afraid not.

17:38.057 --> 17:43.396
A convicted drug dealer
is asking us to leave
an empty theater...

17:44.480 --> 17:45.606
for drinking?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.733
Please go.
I wouldn't want to
have to call the police.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.610
You're old friends,
the police. That's right.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.989
Yeah. Did one of them
slip you their card while
they were handcuffing you?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.534
(clatters)

18:00.037 --> 18:01.414
Come on, guys.
Let's just go.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.713
Cautionary tales
don't usually have
happy endings.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.321
(both laughing)

18:33.321 --> 18:34.655
What the hell was that?

18:34.655 --> 18:37.617
That was Rebecca.
Clean and sober.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.827
I liked her better
dirty and messed up.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.037
Which one's her car?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.204
Zack:
What are you gonna do?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.040
This is her car, right?

18:44.040 --> 18:44.999
Ellie, don't.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.627
I'm just gonna leave her
a little thank you note.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.463
Seriously, Ellie.
Let's just go.
It's not worth it.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.006
Ellie, stop!

18:53.549 --> 18:54.800
What, Maddie?

18:54.800 --> 18:59.472
Okay, I'm sorry that
Rebecca is riding shotgun
on the hot mess express,

18:59.472 --> 19:02.141
but that doesn't
give her a reason to be
a complete bitch to us.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.477
Please, guys.
Let's just go.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.978
I'm gonna do it.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.229
You know what?
Maddie's right. Let's go.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
Yeah. She's tragic enough.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.942
Why is it that when Maddie
wants to do something unhinged,

19:11.942 --> 19:13.110
it's cute and adorable,

19:13.110 --> 19:14.987
and I offer up
one little revenge plot...

19:14.987 --> 19:16.113
Let's go, Ellie.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.199
We can hang at my place.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.534
Come on. Come on.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.078
I can't.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.330
Why?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.998
Is everything okay?

19:25.998 --> 19:26.999
Yeah.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.669
I'm cool. I just got stuff.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.922
Okay.
Well, I could drop you off
at your house.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.007
I'm feeling kind of funny.
I think I'm...

19:36.384 --> 19:37.551
Stomach thing.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.887
I think I'm just gonna walk,
is that okay?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.906
She didn't drink
though, right?

19:58.906 --> 20:01.033
No. But she might have
if I hadn't busted them.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.036
Dude, what's the deal
with you two?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.747
Maddie is a liar
and a manipulator,

20:06.747 --> 20:08.165
and worse,
she's a coward.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.168
Man...

20:11.168 --> 20:13.254
I mean, did you see
the way she acted
with her friends?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.881
Pretending as if
we don't live
in the same house?

20:15.881 --> 20:16.966
A sober house?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.177
In her defense, though...

20:20.177 --> 20:23.180
Look. I get it.
I get the allure. Trust me.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.890
She's fun and cool,

20:24.890 --> 20:28.102
but the minute
that something goes wrong,
she's nowhere to be found.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.478
Stay away from her, Wes.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.949
This is her first
full week in this house.

20:41.949 --> 20:45.244
She was supposed to
meet me right after school,
like she should every day.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.579
That is our agreement.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.165
I feel like I've been
more than fair with her.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.708
Don't you think
I've been more than fair?

20:50.708 --> 20:53.127
Of course I think so.
But I'm old
and responsible.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.171
You are not old.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.881
We are not old.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.215
Yeah, we are.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.760
We used to go to raves.
In the '90s.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.137
You used to wear
baby doll dresses
and suck on pacifiers.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.014
I used to be able to
smoke indoors.

21:06.140 --> 21:09.477
And now we're picking out
which font is better
for your wedding invitation.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.187
I guess we are old.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.021
(door opening)

21:14.190 --> 21:16.358
(sighing)

21:16.358 --> 21:20.571
Look, I'm not telling you
not to give Maddie
hell or anything,

21:20.571 --> 21:22.573
but she is a kid.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.116
Remember what
we were like.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.326
Only too well.

21:26.869 --> 21:30.706
I'm worried.
What if she got into trouble
or I don't know...

21:30.706 --> 21:31.707
(door opening)

21:34.126 --> 21:35.252
Hold that thought.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.338
Trish!

21:38.631 --> 21:39.673
Hey!

21:39.673 --> 21:42.551
Margarita wanted me
to ask you if you would switch
kitchen duty with her.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.928
Is that cool?

21:43.928 --> 21:45.721
Yeah, sure.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.598
Trish, where did
you come from?

21:47.598 --> 21:49.183
Because you're acting
a little weird.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.268
‐Weird?
‐Weird.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.646
No, I'm not.
(laughing awkwardly)

21:53.646 --> 21:55.231
Look at me.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.316
Trish, did you use?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.360
What? That's crazy!

21:59.360 --> 22:01.070
Look at me.

22:01.070 --> 22:05.032
Vern. I did not use.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.033
Happy?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.079
(door opening)

22:16.126 --> 22:19.088
Cynthia, she's here!
Use Craig's office.

22:26.971 --> 22:27.972
Unacceptable.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.975
This is unacceptable
behavior, Maddie.
You can't just disappear.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.269
You know you have to
be back here at 4:00 p. m.
every day

22:33.269 --> 22:35.271
and that I am
supposed to drive you.
Where were you?

22:35.271 --> 22:40.943
Sorry. I was working on
my American history project,
you know, and I...

22:44.572 --> 22:45.865
You know what?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.870
I was with my friends, okay?
We went to see a movie.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.246
I just wanted to have
a normal day.

22:52.246 --> 22:54.832
But, you know,
karma has officially
unfriended me on Facebook,

22:54.832 --> 22:55.875
so that didn't happen.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.128
And when we got to the movies,
it turns out Wes
and Rebecca work there,

22:59.128 --> 23:00.504
so I was almost found out.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.048
Then, someone had a flask,
so Rebecca made us leave.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.677
And Ellie tried to
mess up her car,
and I stopped her.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.513
And now things with
my friends are even worse
than they were before,

23:09.513 --> 23:12.641
and I wonder how long
I'll have a best friend
or a boyfriend.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.728
And I really want a donut.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.443
Did you drink?

23:22.443 --> 23:24.194
No.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.821
Were you going to?

23:28.616 --> 23:29.950
I don't know.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.204
(sighs)

23:36.582 --> 23:39.460
So what are you gonna do now?
You're gonna put me in prison?

23:41.337 --> 23:42.838
You've already done that.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.007
Well, you didn't drink,
which is huge.

23:46.175 --> 23:49.887
And you just told me the truth,
which is the most important
part of recovery.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.890
So, I'm gonna let
this one slide.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.726
‐Really?
‐Yes.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.395
But this
will not happen again.
Understand?

24:00.064 --> 24:02.232
Yup. Got it.
My life is over.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.071
Did you make
any headway on your list?

24:07.071 --> 24:09.448
No, not yet,
but I'm about to.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.036
Craig:
Maddie! How was your day?

24:14.036 --> 24:16.080
Sunshine and puppies,
Craigger.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.959
Sorry to invade.
I was just talking to Maddie.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.878
Lucky you. She's...
She's a tough one.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.213
Believe me. I know.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.591
But she made
some real progress today.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.051
Good. Good. That's good.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.681
She reminds me
so much of me
when I was her age.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.599
Really? That's...

24:35.599 --> 24:36.850
That's nice.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.603
No, it's terrifying.
I was horrible.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.897
Come on. I'm sure
you weren't that bad.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.987
When I was Maddie's age,
I borrowed my uncle's car
without asking.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.781
‐Not so bad.
‐And I sold it.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.032
‐Really?
‐It gets worse.

24:52.032 --> 24:56.078
I used the money
to pay a group of thugs
to beat up my ex‐boyfriend.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.121
‐Wow.
‐Still not done.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.040
He died of internal bleeding.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.211
Craig, I'm kidding.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.966
I know.
But I was pretty bad.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.928
I snuck out
of my house once.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.139
It was at school,
you know, so...

25:29.528 --> 25:32.990
Where is it, Rebecca?
I know you took it.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.825
(rock music playing)

25:41.040 --> 25:44.585
<i>♪ What you gonna do</i>
<i>when they come for you? ♪</i>

25:44.585 --> 25:48.672
<i>♪ What you gonna say</i>
<i>when they make you pay? ♪</i>

25:48.672 --> 25:52.968
<i>♪ Oh, what you going,</i>
<i>what you going ♪</i>

25:55.179 --> 25:57.848
Oh, Rebecca.
Some things never change.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.618
(sighs)

26:39.389 --> 26:40.808
How are you holding up,
pumpkin?

26:42.226 --> 26:43.519
Fine, I guess.

26:43.519 --> 26:47.022
I know it probably seems
like the end of the world
right now.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.774
But it's not.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.818
You're resilient.
You'll get through this.

26:52.069 --> 26:55.197
And we'll always be
right by your side, okay?

26:55.197 --> 26:56.365
Thanks, Dad.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.037
Treatment involves
a lot of discussion.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.665
Just out of curiosity...

27:05.874 --> 27:08.210
what are you gonna tell people
about your situation?

27:08.210 --> 27:10.087
I don't know.

27:10.087 --> 27:13.924
That I was stupid enough
to get hooked on medication
that I didn't need.

27:15.092 --> 27:18.053
Sweetheart, you did
need the Ritalin.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.388
That's why I prescribed it.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.931
Dad, I don't have ADD.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.766
But weren't you able
to study better?

27:22.766 --> 27:25.394
I don't think you would've
got the grades you did
if I hadn't helped you out.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.229
I guess not.
I don't really...

27:27.229 --> 27:29.857
I think that it's best

27:29.857 --> 27:33.944
that we not tell anyone
that I was the one
who gave you the pills.

27:38.907 --> 27:39.908
Okay.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.538
I know it may seem
like an unfair position
to put you in,

27:44.538 --> 27:48.750
but if I were to
lose my license,
I'd also lose this house.

27:48.750 --> 27:53.463
And I wouldn't be able
to take care of your mother
or your brothers or sisters.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.923
Or you.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.301
Nobody wants that, right?

27:57.301 --> 27:59.052
No. Of course not.

27:59.052 --> 28:02.556
Please remember
that you are very lucky that
I play golf with the judge.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.100
Things could have
been far worse.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.227
I didn't raise you
to break the law

28:07.227 --> 28:09.021
or to take drugs
that you don't need, Rebecca.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.941
Dr. Carlson informed me
there were traces of opiates
in your system as well.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.945
I am very disappointed.

28:20.490 --> 28:24.912
Well, I think
we've both learned
a very valuable lesson,

28:24.912 --> 28:26.955
but it's important that

28:28.040 --> 28:30.208
we keep all this
just between us.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.419
Okay?

28:34.004 --> 28:35.005
Okay.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.053
(Marcus sighing)

28:41.053 --> 28:42.471
Dad.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.891
I'm sorry.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.434
Honey, I forgive you.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.057
(all laughing)

29:30.978 --> 29:32.562
Okay, so, let me
get this straight.

29:32.562 --> 29:35.232
A stripper showed up at
your seventh birthday party?

29:35.232 --> 29:37.109
Yes. Dressed as a clown.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.320
My dad accidentally
called the wrong
kind of party place and...

29:41.571 --> 29:43.073
Vern:
I'm just trying
to picture this.

29:43.073 --> 29:46.118
So, like really big shoes?
And a red nose, someplace?

29:46.118 --> 29:48.245
Was your mom,
like, super upset?

29:48.245 --> 29:50.455
Hey! Hey!

29:50.455 --> 29:51.790
Where is it?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.875
I'm... I'm sorry, Rebecca.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.168
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.545
Don't play dumb
with me, Maddie.

29:56.545 --> 30:00.090
I think you know exactly
what I'm talking about,
and I need it back.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.717
Just like I need
my thing back?

30:01.717 --> 30:02.968
What thing?

30:02.968 --> 30:04.803
Now look who's playing dumb?

30:04.803 --> 30:08.140
I suggest if you want it back,
you remember
where my thing is!

30:08.140 --> 30:10.142
Oh, my God,
Maddie, I cannot
even begin‐‐

30:10.142 --> 30:12.060
I don't know
what's going on here‐‐

30:12.060 --> 30:13.061
You know what?
All right.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.230
Do you guys remember
my ex‐best friend?

30:15.230 --> 30:17.315
The one that I always
talk about in group?

30:17.315 --> 30:18.567
The one that used to
sell with me,

30:18.567 --> 30:20.986
and then when I got busted
was nowhere to be found?

30:22.404 --> 30:23.405
Ta‐da!

30:25.073 --> 30:26.408
Na‐uh!

30:26.408 --> 30:28.368
Maddie's the evil ex‐bestie?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.037
‐Look, I tried
to get you to stop.
‐Yeah.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.622
You tried real hard.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.751
Where'd the money go, Maddie?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.502
Let me guess,
you gave it to charity.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.547
Come on.
Come up with a good lie.
It's your greatest talent.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.133
You know what
I should have done
with the money?

30:43.133 --> 30:44.801
I really should have
just shoved it up your ass!

30:44.801 --> 30:47.137
Hey, hey, enough, enough.
Both of you calm down now.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.184
I hate you.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.279
Do I have to finish
chopping up the carrots?

31:04.279 --> 31:06.865
No. No, go on.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.950
Go.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.993
Maddie.

31:11.369 --> 31:15.707
You are entering
a very difficult and
challenging phase of your life.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.793
You're gonna need
all the friends you can get.
Remember that.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.129
Yeah.

31:25.759 --> 31:26.927
(door opens)

31:29.179 --> 31:30.180
Hey!

31:33.100 --> 31:34.643
Thanks.

31:34.643 --> 31:35.811
Any good?

31:35.811 --> 31:38.230
Well, Vern did the cooking,
so no.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.775
But Cray‐Cray's gonna go
get us all fast food,
so yay!

31:46.113 --> 31:49.407
So, I have
a question for you.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.911
About the thing you were
talking about earlier.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.329
Okay.

31:54.329 --> 31:58.416
Were you talking about
the figurine that
your dad gave you?

31:58.416 --> 32:00.127
Trish, have you been
watching <i>CSI</i> again?

32:00.127 --> 32:02.087
Because your deductive skills
are right on.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.683
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sor‐‐
I was just dancing.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.026
And I knocked
over the figurine
and then it broke,

32:25.026 --> 32:26.069
and I didn't know
what to do.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.821
You had so many
drugs in there.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.240
I mean, there were joints,
there were pills,
there was blow...

32:30.240 --> 32:32.534
‐Did you tell anyone?
‐No.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.244
‐Use them?
‐No.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.789
I sold them.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.167
You did what?

32:40.167 --> 32:42.294
I sold them. And?

32:42.294 --> 32:43.461
I hired The Bulldog!

32:44.629 --> 32:47.215
The Bulldog!
Milo K. Spevacek.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.301
He's famous.
Attorney at law.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.845
You may have even
sat on his face
at a bus stop.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.722
Look, Maddie.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.473
No one thinks
that I can do this.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.268
No one thinks that
I can get
my little girl back.

32:58.268 --> 33:01.021
No one believes that
I can raise her by myself.

33:02.272 --> 33:03.815
But The Bulldog does.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.944
And for a $250 retainer
and a reasonable hourly rate

33:07.944 --> 33:12.157
taking into account
my income and
strange circumstances,

33:12.157 --> 33:13.533
he's gonna help me.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.202
Plus, I was helping you.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.037
You know, I was afraid that
you were gonna use them,

33:17.037 --> 33:19.080
so I had to get rid of 'em.
You're welcome.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.708
Trish, I am grateful
you didn't tell Craig,

33:21.708 --> 33:24.794
but I asked you point‐blank,
and you lied to me.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.840
Your lying thing
and stealing thing?
Not okay.

33:28.840 --> 33:33.011
Oh, so you bringing
a stash of drugs
into a sober house is okay?

33:35.889 --> 33:37.057
‐Trish.
‐Na‐uh.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.236
Why is this day not over yet?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.929
Bri!

34:15.929 --> 34:17.681
Hi.

34:17.681 --> 34:21.142
Yes, it was great
seeing you, too.

34:21.142 --> 34:23.478
I was just, you know,
calling to...

34:24.604 --> 34:25.939
let you know that...

34:27.899 --> 34:29.442
I didn't tell you
the truth today.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.031
Maddie, she's not
volunteering...

34:36.157 --> 34:40.245
or... getting good grades.

34:40.245 --> 34:43.999
She's actually kinda
going through it right now.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.334
We're okay.
I mean, we're just...

34:47.377 --> 34:49.462
dealing with things.

34:50.588 --> 34:54.092
And we have a plan that
we're following through on.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.344
Okay.

34:57.637 --> 34:58.722
I'll talk to you later.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.850
Bye.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.490
(knock on door)

35:21.161 --> 35:22.370
Hey.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.122
You need to go.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.916
I'm too depleted to argue
with you anymore today.

35:26.916 --> 35:27.959
I'm not here to argue.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.420
I'm here to apologize.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.965
I know you didn't
take my thing.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.509
And I know these are yours.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.275
You're gonna learn

35:52.275 --> 35:54.903
that a true friend
wouldn't give pills back
to a recovering addict.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.493
(whispering)
Maddie. Maddie, stop.
What are you doing?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.161
Doing what
a true friend would do.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.997
Maddie, don't.
I take it back.
I'm sorry. Please.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.957
Maddie, stop.
It's not what you think.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.250
It's exactly
what I think.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.211
It doesn't matter
if I flush these
down the toilet,

36:11.211 --> 36:14.005
it doesn't matter
if I smile at you
or scowl at you,

36:14.005 --> 36:16.341
because I'm damned if I do
and I'm damned if I don't,

36:16.341 --> 36:18.259
So, you know what?

36:18.259 --> 36:21.221
Maddie, no, don't.
It's not like that.
I need them.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.473
Spoiler alert.
Addicts need drugs.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.141
They're not
for getting high.

36:26.976 --> 36:30.063
It's called Suboxone.
It's used to treat addiction.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.148
Why are you hiding them?

36:32.148 --> 36:35.235
Because it's controversial
in the recovery community,

36:35.235 --> 36:36.986
and it's banned
from the house.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.947
Craig thinks
that it's too risky.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.365
And the withdrawals
can be very dangerous,

36:40.365 --> 36:43.451
which is why
I needed them back.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.953
I cannot miss a dose.
Please.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.539
They're really helping me
stay sober.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.556
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Craig.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.725
You kept my secret.
I'll keep yours.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.438
I didn't rat you out.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.148
But you didn't
have my back, either.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.316
‐What was I supposed to...
‐Something.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.693
You should have
done something.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.363
But that's not your thing,
is it?

37:22.157 --> 37:24.993
I mean, you did nothing today

37:24.993 --> 37:30.123
when everyone
was going on and on
about how tragic I was.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.250
You know
I'm getting better.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.418
I just didn't know
what to...

37:33.418 --> 37:35.503
No, you didn't know.
You never do.

37:38.465 --> 37:42.719
Please, just stay
as far away from me as possible
from now on.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.378
Wes:
Hey.

38:20.965 --> 38:21.966
Hey.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.094
Can't sleep?

38:25.094 --> 38:26.429
Never can.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.723
Me neither.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.351
Pretty sure I've been
an insomniac ever since
I was in the womb.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.231
This is actually
one of the best parts
of the movie.

38:36.231 --> 38:40.735
Gets better at the end.
When Sonny Chiba
kills the guy on the boat.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.237
Big fan of kung fu movies.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.364
Me, too.
They're awesome.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.955
Wesley Hector Stewart.

38:53.957 --> 38:54.958
Huh?

That's my middle name.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.259
You do know I'm the evil bitch
who destroyed
your girlfriend's life, right?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.094
'Cause you're kinda hanging
with the enemy here.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.971
Rebecca's not my girlfriend.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.266
‐Oh.
‐And you know what?

39:11.266 --> 39:13.309
There are always two sides
to every story,

39:13.309 --> 39:15.979
so no judgment here.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.021
Thanks.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.691
I just thought
that was the reason

39:19.691 --> 39:21.109
you were avoiding me
since we snuck out.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.944
Not why.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.112
Gotcha.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.158
I'm not ignoring you now?

39:31.327 --> 39:32.579
Am I?
