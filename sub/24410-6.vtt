WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:15.960
Why are we here?
What was so important?

00:19.920 --> 00:25.040
-What the hell is that?
-Your father. My brother.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.560
Mauritz.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.000
I think Fredrik is home.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.680
-What makes you think that?
-The lights are on at Mildred's.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.000
-Will you go over?
-I don't know.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.760
Lasse gave me
50,000 euro to keep quiet.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.640
But the money was counterfeit.
50,000 in fake fucking notes!

00:53.520 --> 00:58.160
Lasse, I just wanted to check if
you've been paid in fake notes.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.120
-No, why would we?
-We've had some in circulation.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.240
No, not that I know of.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.040
-I want to know the truth.
-It wasn't murder.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.240
-Then what was it?
-It was an accident.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.960
Jonna!

01:22.760 --> 01:25.040
-Let go!
-Give it to me!

02:02.200 --> 02:03.160
Let's go, Jonna.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.160
Jonna?

02:53.360 --> 02:56.440
THICKER THAN WATER

03:20.120 --> 03:25.600
How could it fire, Lasse? I don't get
it. I was just taking it from him.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.640
-It was an accident.
-I don't see how it could go off.

03:30.720 --> 03:35.120
I was just going to take it from him.
I didn't do anything.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.560
-We have to get out of here.
-No. We can't leave now.

03:40.640 --> 03:46.400
-Let's just sell and go. Please.
-If we don't, we'll seem suspicious.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.480
We just have to get rid of the
evidence.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.000
The money.
We have to get rid of the money.

03:55.080 --> 03:59.520
Never mind that now. Get some rest.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.560
Hello?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.320
Hello, Fredrik?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.800
Hello?

05:08.440 --> 05:09.920
Fredrik?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.200
Fredrik?

05:29.960 --> 05:31.800
Fredrik? Are you okay?

05:35.560 --> 05:36.480
Let go!

05:46.760 --> 05:49.960
Help me!

05:50.040 --> 05:53.040
Please!

05:59.160 --> 06:01.400
Help me!

06:08.040 --> 06:09.840
Please.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.680
-I'll call an ambulance!
-No, no ambulance, please!

06:18.040 --> 06:22.400
All I need is some antibiotics.
And I'm good.

06:22.480 --> 06:26.520
Alright? I'm Andrus, by the way.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.960
Kim.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.800
-Do we have any aspirin?
-Do you have a headache?

06:49.880 --> 06:51.760
Menstrual cramps.

06:51.840 --> 06:57.200
Check the box in the reception.
The key is in the register.

06:57.280 --> 07:02.880
-Oh yeah, is there a hunt going on?
-No.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.480
I heard a gunshot
when I was out running.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.480
There might be some kind
of bird hunt going on.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.800
-Grouse, I think.
-Where did you hear it?

07:14.880 --> 07:17.960
Past the mailboxes on the right.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.960
Hare!
European hare is hunted in winter.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.920
-It was more towards the water.
-Do you mind...?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.800
Sure.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.560
-Do you think she saw something?
-No.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.760
-You know what we have to do, right?
-No.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.840
We have to get Mauritz.

07:52.440 --> 07:57.600
We have to stick together, Oskar.
The worst thing we can do is panic.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.080
Selling or leaving would only
make things worse.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.920
-Can you talk to Jonna? Oskar?
-What?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.920
Can you talk to Jonna about sticking
together? She won't listen to me.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.880
Is he still there?

09:22.360 --> 09:28.360
All right. I guess we'll just put him
in bin bags and take him to the dump.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.160
-I promised Jonna we'd bury him.
-Not a chance.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.360
I've already buried him twice.
Enough is enough.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.840
We can put it in one of those.

09:40.920 --> 09:46.360
Lasse, the ground is frozen.
You can't dig 10 cm in it.

09:46.440 --> 09:51.400
Well, then we'll have to burn it.
The bones have started to decompose.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.880
So this is where you've been hiding.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.560
Would you like to come with me
to Helsinki for some shopping?

10:31.280 --> 10:33.280
Is something wrong?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.160
This won't work, Wille.
I can't do this.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.160
-Can't do what?
-You and me.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.760
I can't.

10:53.040 --> 10:58.200
-If it's too fast, I can slow down.
-It's not that.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.960
I just can't right now.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.720
What happened?

11:06.720 --> 11:08.760
I like you. I really do.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.640
But I just can't right now.

11:15.040 --> 11:20.000
-I don't get it. What's the problem?
-Wille, please just go.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.560
Go.

11:39.880 --> 11:45.240
-Kim? Where is everyone?
-I think Jonna is ill.

11:45.320 --> 11:50.080
-Ill how?
-She was feeling nauseous.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.960
It wouldn't be the first time
she bails on her own schedule.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.880
-Maybe she's pregnant.
-What do you mean?

11:57.960 --> 12:03.160
She's been seeing Wille, and now
she's feeling nauseous. Do the maths.

12:39.080 --> 12:44.720
The hot tub looks lovely.
I might try it after dinner.

12:45.920 --> 12:50.440
-What are you doing?
-Having Christmas dinner.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.960
Same as every year.

12:53.040 --> 12:59.560
I offered to pay, but Liv insisted
it was on the house. So nice of her.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.960
-Anything else to drink?
-No, thanks.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.320
-Let me know if you need anything.
-I will.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.200
Lasse! Wait!

13:47.360 --> 13:51.800
-I need the rest of the money.
-When the job is done.

13:51.880 --> 13:56.520
I'm taking another job and my
replacement wants to be paid now.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.960
-Not my problem.
-Listen to me.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.960
I used the money you paid me
to pay off a debt.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.920
When he finds out the money is
counterfeit, he will call the police.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.520
-Is that not your problem either?
-I'm broke, what can I do?

14:13.800 --> 14:16.800
Do you have more counterfeit notes?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.600
How much?

14:20.600 --> 14:26.960
-Why?
-A friend of mine lives in Helsinki.

14:27.040 --> 14:33.360
If you sell them to him, he'll pay
you 30-35% of their value.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.440
But I want 10% to make the deal.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.560
Forget it.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.400
-What the hell, I need my money!
-You'll get your fucking money!

14:42.480 --> 14:46.080
-I'll take care of it, all right?
-You have the weekend.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.960
Hi! How come you're all alone?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.400
Where's your daddy?

15:16.680 --> 15:21.760
Do you want to come inside?
There's meatballs!

15:21.840 --> 15:23.280
Come on!

15:57.560 --> 15:58.400
Christ...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.000
Sorry.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.280
Sorry.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.360
We need to clean it.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.680
Your wound.

17:01.560 --> 17:08.440
<i>She's the light of my life. Her. Only</i>
<i>her. I will leave her everything.</i>

17:08.520 --> 17:13.440
<i>The others will get nothing.</i>
<i>Jonna will get everything.</i>

17:30.320 --> 17:34.760
-I didn't know you painted.
-It's just to pass the time.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.160
-It's strange I've never been here.
-Is it?

17:43.240 --> 17:48.040
Maybe not. You've always been
Oskar's friend rather than mine.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.080
That's why I'm here.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.440
I...

17:58.520 --> 18:02.400
I worry about him.
I don't think he's well.

18:02.480 --> 18:07.320
I think he's hiding something from
me. I thought maybe you knew what.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.520
Even if I did know, I couldn't tell
you because of confidentiality.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.240
I didn't think you were a priest
anymore.

18:21.640 --> 18:27.440
I take it he spent a lot of time here
when I was away. For comfort.

18:27.520 --> 18:32.040
-Don't beat around the bush.
-Do you want him?

18:33.040 --> 18:37.400
Perhaps it would be more relevant
to ask if he wants you.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.880
Would you like to sit down?

18:46.600 --> 18:50.720
-What has he told you?
-Nothing.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.440
I hope you have the decency to tell
me what you have been doing.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.920
-I don't owe you anything.
-You're right, you don't.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.120
It's not me he wants.

19:06.320 --> 19:11.880
We lived like a couple for over a
month then he dumped me with a text.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.720
I'm sorry.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.920
It's not funny. A text message?

19:20.920 --> 19:24.960
-Oskar... He can be such an...
-Idiot.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.520
Exactly! An idiot.

19:35.400 --> 19:40.120
-You love him, don't you?
-Yes.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.320
I love him almost as much
as the idea of another life.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.480
How was Nepal?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.560
Don't you want to go back?

19:52.640 --> 19:54.400
No.

19:55.280 --> 20:01.080
Maybe a little. I sometimes miss
being able to come and go as I like.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.720
Get away from routine.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.520
You're pregnant!

20:17.160 --> 20:21.720
-I don't know what to do.
-I have to ask you to leave.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.200
-He doesn't know.
-Don't tell me anything else.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.480
You can't trust me.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.760
-Please leave.
-Okay.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.920
You're home late.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.080
I was at Petra's.

21:17.880 --> 21:21.800
I thought maybe she knew why
you've been acting strange lately.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.760
Well?

21:34.680 --> 21:38.040
When are we going to talk about this?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.160
You're a piece of work.

21:43.960 --> 21:49.520
You come back home
after weeks... months of silence

21:49.600 --> 21:54.040
and assume that I will forgive you
straight away. Which I have!

21:54.120 --> 22:00.920
-I want to forget and move on.
-But then nothing has changed.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.120
-We repeat the same old pattern.
-What's wrong with that?

22:06.200 --> 22:10.120
Isn't that what we want?
Go back to our old lives.

22:10.200 --> 22:15.440
Not if it means that we have to
keep secrets from each other.

22:15.520 --> 22:19.160
What are you hiding?
You, Jonna and Lasse.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.040
Nothing.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.680
There are things I want to tell you.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.760
-For my sake?
-For our sake.

22:39.840 --> 22:45.080
For yours. You need to get
something off your chest.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.600
You don't care about my feelings.

22:48.680 --> 22:53.160
I can spare you your confession.
I already know.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.480
I saw you kiss last summer.
You and Lasse.

22:58.560 --> 23:03.440
Since you didn't say anything,
I pretended it never happened.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.520
To be able to keep going.

23:08.240 --> 23:13.120
You should stop playing the martyr.
Do you regret it?

23:13.200 --> 23:16.320
-What?
-Your night with Petra.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.080
Yes.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
It meant nothing.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.120
Until you decide...

23:28.200 --> 23:33.760
to be completely honest with me,
we have nothing to say to each other.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.600
I don't know who you are anymore.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.320
Petra?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.560
-Petra, open up!
<i>-Go away!</i>

24:44.640 --> 24:46.680
Just open the door, Petra!

24:48.720 --> 24:52.280
I don't want to talk to you.
Just leave.

24:52.360 --> 24:56.280
-We have to talk.
-Stop it! Can't you hear me?

24:56.360 --> 24:58.960
Fine, come inside.

25:01.160 --> 25:07.360
-Take your shoes off!
-I didn't know this would happen.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.480
-I never meant to hurt you.
-Well, you did.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.760
You know how important you are to me.

25:17.880 --> 25:23.400
-I wouldn't have made it without you.
-I'm no damn fallback!

25:23.480 --> 25:27.240
-You used me.
-I...

25:28.120 --> 25:34.240
I was selfish. I wasn't thinking.
I didn't know I was leading you on.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.800
Hey...

25:36.680 --> 25:39.680
You're my best friend, Petra.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.640
I miss you.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.280
I miss you too.

25:51.280 --> 25:55.280
Could you tell me exactly what
Liv said when she was here?

25:55.360 --> 25:58.040
I don't want to make things worse.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.600
I'm so stupid. You're not here
to save our friendship.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.080
-I am.
-You're here for Liv.

26:08.720 --> 26:14.400
You don't care about me. You miss
your adviser, not your friend.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.840
-I'm trying to save my marriage!
-Go ahead. Go home to your wife.

26:18.920 --> 26:21.560
You have a thing or two to discuss.

26:21.640 --> 26:25.520
-What are you talking about?
-Get out!

26:25.600 --> 26:27.600
Out! Get out!

27:01.280 --> 27:03.880
Hi. Good morning.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.800
-Do you have a minute?
-Yes.

27:09.720 --> 27:14.560
-Is something the matter?
-Nothing new, just the notes again.

27:14.640 --> 27:18.800
-Notes?
-I thought maybe Lasse had told you.

27:18.880 --> 27:22.160
We've had reports of
counterfeit fifties

27:22.240 --> 27:25.640
from restaurants and
a petrol station.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.080
They all have the same serial number.

27:31.160 --> 27:34.600
Do you mind taking a look
if you have any?

27:35.600 --> 27:38.320
-Fifties, right?
-Yes.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.920
This number here.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.680
-Nope, none of them are the same.
-Great.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.120
You can keep that.
My number is on the back.

27:54.200 --> 28:00.120
Could you ask your staff
to keep an eye out?

28:00.200 --> 28:04.160
-Absolutely.
-Thank you for your help.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.400
Hey!

28:31.560 --> 28:34.880
-Hello.
-How are you?

28:36.080 --> 28:39.880
-Fine.
-Isn't that Konrad's dog?

28:41.240 --> 28:44.920
-That's right.
-Are you friends again?

28:45.000 --> 28:49.600
-I have nothing against his dog.
-Are you looking after it?

28:49.680 --> 28:53.480
-Occasionally.
-Because...?

28:53.560 --> 28:59.480
Konrad was going away for a few days,
so he asked Kim to look after it.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.600
-Where was he going?
-He didn't say.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.320
-Is tonight good?
-For what?

29:09.840 --> 29:10.960
Dinner.

29:11.800 --> 29:17.760
-I promised I'd cook you dinner.
-Right. Sure, I'd love to.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.760
-Great! You know where I live.
-Indeed.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.040
-Six o'clock?
-Great.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.880
-Good.
-See you.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.560
I know a place where we can bury Dad.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.720
Good, but we have to burn the body.

31:32.800 --> 31:38.960
We can't dig a grave now, and we
can't risk someone finding him again.

31:39.040 --> 31:43.840
Okay. I understand.
Then we'll burn him there.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.040
Bring the money.
We'll burn them at the same time.

31:49.120 --> 31:53.000
-It that such a good idea?
-What else can we do?

31:53.080 --> 31:56.640
-We're up to our necks in bills.
-What are you getting at?

31:56.720 --> 32:00.720
There may be an alternative.
Lasse, maybe you can...

32:00.800 --> 32:05.280
He's not doing anything.
We can't trust him.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.360
At least look at me.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.680
Just bring the money.

32:13.480 --> 32:18.040
-Are we doing this tonight?
-Yes, I have to do something first.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.360
-What?
-Dinner.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.320
-Dinner? With who?
-Laura.

32:26.160 --> 32:30.320
-The cop?
-We're supposed to avoid the police.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.320
She wanted to thank me
for giving her son a lift.

32:33.400 --> 32:37.320
-Cancel it.
-Maybe it isn't such a bad idea.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.040
It won't hurt to get
on her good side.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.760
See you tonight.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.200
Lasse?

34:52.040 --> 34:55.320
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

34:56.800 --> 35:02.720
I was going for a walk. Clear my
mind. Would you like to come?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.800
Have a chat.

35:06.120 --> 35:10.960
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes, as a matter of fact.

35:11.040 --> 35:14.280
-I'm going out for dinner.
-With who?

35:14.360 --> 35:17.800
-Laura.
-Laura Nord?

35:17.880 --> 35:21.880
It's just to say thank you.
I helped her with her son.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.600
-Some other time.
-Did you want anything in particular?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.640
Liv?

35:28.240 --> 35:31.520
-Is something the matter?
-Well...

35:31.600 --> 35:34.160
Wear the blue shirt instead.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.680
-Really?
-Yes.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.680
You don't want to look like a waiter.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.080
All right, thanks.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.680
Come on in.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.560
-It smells good.
-We'll see how it turns out.

36:06.640 --> 36:11.200
It was all going great until
I remembered you're a chef.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.120
-Where is Eskil?
-He's at a friend's house. Wine?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.560
Yes, please.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.240
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.240
Cheers.

37:44.160 --> 37:49.440
-How is it being back at the inn?
-Well...

37:49.520 --> 37:56.360
It's different.
Stockholm and Åland are worlds apart.

37:58.120 --> 38:01.840
-You don't want to stay here, do you?
-I do.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.200
I think so.

38:05.280 --> 38:10.280
I've been running away from this
place all my life, but now...

38:10.360 --> 38:12.800
It's starting to feel like home.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.080
Is it weird working with
your siblings?

38:16.160 --> 38:19.680
It has its ups and downs.

38:19.760 --> 38:24.000
-Do you have any siblings?
-I'm an only child. Just like Eskil.

38:26.120 --> 38:31.120
-Do you spoil him?
-Maybe a little bit.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.760
-And Kim? Have you spoiled her?
-No.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.760
Unfortunately not.

38:38.840 --> 38:44.280
I should have, but... no.

38:44.360 --> 38:50.800
-But she's tough. She's smart.
-She's growing up.

38:50.880 --> 38:56.000
You might be right.
She doesn't take after me.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.000
-Is she like her mum?
-A little.

38:58.920 --> 39:04.840
But she's... warmer.
What about Eskil? Is he like his dad?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.400
No.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.360
You don't have to tell me.

39:12.720 --> 39:17.560
He was almost never physically
violent. It was mostly just threats.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.160
He took pleasure in my fear.

39:23.040 --> 39:26.400
I started to prefer him to hit me.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.480
Instead of just waiting for
it to happen.

39:31.720 --> 39:38.440
When I became pregnant, it got worse.
He kicked me in the stomach.

39:41.240 --> 39:46.600
I brought my service pistol home...
and waited for him to arrive.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.520
I couldn't leave him.
He would have found me...

39:53.640 --> 39:56.360
wherever I went.

39:56.440 --> 39:59.760
If I had stayed,
he would have killed the baby.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.480
Did you shoot him?

40:04.840 --> 40:07.000
He never made it home.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.960
He killed himself driving drunk.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.840
But I was going to shoot him.

40:25.760 --> 40:28.960
-You had no choice.
-Yes, I did.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.960
I chose to protect Eskil.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.640
<i>She is the light of my life.</i>

41:13.640 --> 41:18.160
<i>Her. Only her.</i>
<i>I will leave her everything.</i>

41:19.440 --> 41:24.560
<i>The others will get nothing.</i>
<i>Jonna will get everything.</i>

42:17.320 --> 42:19.920
The money's going in.

42:30.680 --> 42:34.600
Oskar. I'm warning you, Oskar.

42:35.600 --> 42:39.160
I'm warning you. Beware.

42:39.240 --> 42:43.560
-I can't hear you.
-Beware.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.720
-I can't hear you.
-Oskar?

42:47.080 --> 42:49.040
-What's wrong?
-Oskar?

42:50.360 --> 42:51.840
I...

42:52.840 --> 42:57.160
-I thought I saw...
-What?

42:57.240 --> 42:58.960
Nothing.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.040
It was nothing.

43:05.200 --> 43:08.200
