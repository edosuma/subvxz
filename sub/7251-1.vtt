00:18.663 --> 00:19.829
And we're home.

00:19.963 --> 00:22.240
How long does a freakin' van ride take?

00:22.301 --> 00:23.095
Not that long!

00:23.244 --> 00:26.025
Everybody in the world's life flashed before my eyes.

00:26.174 --> 00:27.386
That's how much time I had.

00:27.533 --> 00:29.568
I thought we were gonna die on that van.

00:29.685 --> 00:31.113
It seemed a good possibility.

00:31.681 --> 00:34.590
That van ride felt longer than our train ride from Paris to Prague,

00:34.668 --> 00:37.325
and we had that group of French boys singing Sk8er Boi

00:37.407 --> 00:39.803
and smelling like a soccer field sitting all around us.

00:39.925 --> 00:42.307
Oh my God, you're back!

00:42.864 --> 00:44.579
Morey, they're back!

00:45.185 --> 00:47.052
Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?

00:47.144 --> 00:47.959
Oh, we're fine.

00:48.164 --> 00:50.679
You're fine? They're fine! Morey!

00:50.974 --> 00:53.114
- They're fine! 
- Okay.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.691
What the hell happened to you two?

00:54.794 --> 00:56.924
According to the itinerary that Rory gave me,

00:57.002 --> 00:58.858
you were supposed to be home on Saturday.

00:59.003 --> 01:00.738
The itinerary that Rory gave you?

01:00.836 --> 01:03.508
So when you girls didn't show up, we panicked! Morey?

01:04.277 --> 01:05.787
Didn't we panic?

01:06.728 --> 01:09.945
Hey, Morey, you ever thought about just staying out here at times like these?

01:10.011 --> 01:12.176
By Sunday night, I was a complete basketcase.

01:12.274 --> 01:15.515
I thought you'd been kidnapped by some crazy Sandinistas or something.

01:15.663 --> 01:17.773
'Cause the Sandinista movement is so popular in France.

01:17.906 --> 01:20.578
So, finally, I just started calling consulates.

01:20.753 --> 01:22.263
- Consulates? 
- How many consulates?

01:22.382 --> 01:25.320
Ah, jeez, all of 'em. Anyhow, you're here.

01:25.438 --> 01:29.431
Let's go inside, I wanna hear all about Europe. Morey, I'm going in!

01:32.052 --> 01:33.557
You gave her an itinerary?

01:33.758 --> 01:36.016
I thought it would be good for someone to know where we were.

01:36.144 --> 01:39.021
Oh, you gave her an itinerary and she called every consulate in the world.

01:39.276 --> 01:42.057
If we were caught smuggling hash over the border

01:42.134 --> 01:44.284
and we were thrown in some Turkish prison,

01:44.413 --> 01:46.460
wouldn't you want someone to know that we were in Turkey?

01:46.609 --> 01:47.997
Where'd we get this hash we were smuggling?

01:48.222 --> 01:50.977
You were at a café, you met a guy, he was sweet-talking you,

01:51.048 --> 01:52.503
he put the stuff in your purse when you weren't looking.

01:52.762 --> 01:54.203
At least tell me he was cute.

01:54.369 --> 01:55.764
He was not bad for a hash dealer.

01:58.082 --> 01:59.789
I'm making cocoa!

02:00.818 --> 02:03.081
She's making cocoa 'cause you gave her an itinerary.

02:03.204 --> 02:04.524
I may have given her the itinerary,

02:04.633 --> 02:06.799
but you're the one who got us busted for drug smuggling.

02:07.899 --> 02:10.121
Reality has absolutely no place in our world.

02:10.473 --> 02:13.397
Okay, I wanna hear all about Europe.

02:13.542 --> 02:16.337
Come on, tell me, what'd you see?

02:16.449 --> 02:21.400
Well, everything. Notre Dame, the Roman Baths, St. Peter's Basilica.

02:21.492 --> 02:23.132
- Mom touched the Pope. 
- You're kidding!

02:23.209 --> 02:24.396
Actually, I just touched his car.

02:24.518 --> 02:27.191
Then one of the Swiss guards in the fruity cool clothing busted me.

02:27.289 --> 02:28.634
Luckily, Mom's fluent in flirting.

02:28.861 --> 02:31.948
And flirting with a guy in a pompom hat and a skirt is quite an accomplishment.

02:32.297 --> 02:34.923
It sounds like you had a terrific trip.

02:35.035 --> 02:35.698
It was.

02:39.854 --> 02:41.216
Are you okay, hon?

02:41.375 --> 02:43.503
Yeah, I'm just a little sleepy.

02:43.781 --> 02:46.780
Of course, you girls must be wiped.

02:46.903 --> 02:49.642
- I'll get out of here. 
- Oh, but thanks, Babette.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.274
Goodnight, sleep tight. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

02:52.842 --> 02:55.403
Morey, I'm coming home!

02:56.278 --> 02:58.449
- I'm gonna go unpack. 
- Oh, unpack tomorrow.

02:58.572 --> 03:01.516
No, if I leave stuff packed overnight, everything's gonna get gross.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.109
Everything's already gross.

03:08.066 --> 03:11.132
Oh my God, your bed feels good.

03:11.264 --> 03:14.106
Do not get comfortable. I will sleep on top of you if I have to.

03:14.183 --> 03:15.919
- Oh man, smell this. 
- What?

03:16.005 --> 03:18.216
I forgot that pillows don't have to smell like feet.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.970
You know, I have to say, I think it's good I did this hostel thing in my thirties,

03:22.108 --> 03:25.463
- and I'll tell you why. 
- I missed you, I missed you all!

03:25.539 --> 03:28.314
If I had done it in my twenties or teens,

03:28.386 --> 03:32.160
I would've been naïve enough to think that hostels were exotic and romantic.

03:32.365 --> 03:35.085
But once you're in your thirties, you've lived enough to know

03:35.145 --> 03:37.095
they're gross and should be avoided at all costs.

03:37.192 --> 03:39.122
I had a dream about you in Copenhagen.

03:39.432 --> 03:41.903
You were there, and you, and you, and you.

03:41.996 --> 03:44.929
Listen, since we slept on the plane, we should go to sleep now,

03:44.985 --> 03:47.330
but get up really early tomorrow. We don't wanna blow this whole week

03:47.377 --> 03:50.167
being jet-lagged. We need to establish normal sleeping patterns.

03:50.253 --> 03:51.590
- Fine. 
- Okay.

03:51.676 --> 03:54.569
I'm gonna go take a shower and leave you alone to make out with your sock drawer.

03:54.673 --> 03:55.434
Close the door.

04:00.601 --> 04:01.646
Hello, boys.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.363
Gilmore, Lorelai, yes.

05:00.614 --> 05:02.334
My daughter's name is Lorelai also.

05:03.056 --> 05:05.600
Very confusing or, in your case, extremely convenient.

05:07.331 --> 05:10.480
No, see, we were never missing, it was a big mistake.

05:10.671 --> 05:11.961
- Who are you talking to? 
- Belgium.

05:12.805 --> 05:14.331
Yes, Babette Dell.

05:14.532 --> 05:17.756
She got our arrival dates mixed up and she was just worried,

05:17.834 --> 05:19.599
but we're fine, we're here.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.119
We just loved your fries.

05:22.062 --> 05:23.593
Okay, sure, bye bye.

05:24.121 --> 05:26.860
Okay, Belgium's done, Lisbon's calling me back,

05:26.936 --> 05:29.593
Berlin had no idea what I was talking about, and Paris is pissed.

05:29.686 --> 05:31.063
- At who? 
- Who knows?

05:31.576 --> 05:34.903
Okay, I'm taking a break and then I'm taking on the Netherlands.

05:35.103 --> 05:36.870
I still cannot believe Babette did this.

05:36.981 --> 05:37.873
She just loves us.

05:37.997 --> 05:40.940
Well, be a little less lovable, would you, 'cause it's costing me a fortune.

05:41.031 --> 05:42.696
Try being one of those kids where people are like,

05:42.762 --> 05:45.983
"Oh really, she was kidnapped? Hey, well, thin the herd."

05:46.101 --> 05:49.003
Very nice. Hey, who are the rosary beads for?

05:49.153 --> 05:49.864
They're mine.

05:50.212 --> 05:51.389
What do you need rosary beads for?

05:51.477 --> 05:52.710
- They're cute. 
- They're for prayer.

05:53.013 --> 05:55.065
Well, pray they match my blue suit?

05:55.245 --> 05:58.804
They have just upgraded you to a queen-size bed, Jacuzzi tub, junior suite in hell.

05:58.975 --> 06:01.707
- Oh, Pieta placemat? 
- Oh, Gypsy.

06:02.481 --> 06:03.612
How are you feeling?

06:04.020 --> 06:06.362
You know, not bad. Just a little spacy.

06:06.586 --> 06:07.923
Like a cold medicine buzz?

06:08.025 --> 06:09.520
Maybe we got lucky and missed the jet lag.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.305
I hope so because we have a very big week ahead of us.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.207
Oh yeah? 

06:13.293 --> 06:15.915
Yes. In fact, I have here in my hand a schedule of all the activities

06:15.991 --> 06:18.014
we are going to partake in over this week,

06:18.224 --> 06:20.456
the final week of Rory Gilmore's life

06:20.652 --> 06:24.451
before she enters the ivy-covered hallowed halls of Yale University.

06:24.547 --> 06:25.540
- Schedule, please. 
- Okay.

06:25.751 --> 06:28.321
Today we get these presents out to our friends and then we hit the mall.

06:28.464 --> 06:29.006
Got it.

06:29.115 --> 06:30.810
Tomorrow we get an early start

06:30.926 --> 06:33.406
and we hit three of the crappier movies that are out.

06:33.507 --> 06:34.783
And then we have dinner at Grandma's.

06:34.884 --> 06:36.954
Which I will conveniently not put down on my list in the hopes

06:36.999 --> 06:38.500
that that magically goes away.

06:38.643 --> 06:43.794
Okay, the next day we hit New York, see your fancy art galleries, hit the Strand.

06:43.865 --> 06:45.335
Pizza at John's.

06:45.483 --> 06:48.059
Sunday, pick up all the stuff you need for school,

06:48.136 --> 06:49.437
and then there's a barbecue at Sookie's.

06:49.517 --> 06:52.651
Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic,

06:52.737 --> 06:54.136
and stock up for Tuesday,

06:54.387 --> 06:57.490
the day of all days - Godfather I, II, and III,

06:57.566 --> 07:00.264
with extra showings of the Sofia death scene over and over

07:00.341 --> 07:01.991
as long as the Mallomars hold out.

07:02.062 --> 07:03.485
- The perfect day! 
- I agree.

07:03.614 --> 07:05.799
And I think we have just enough of the biscotti

07:05.878 --> 07:07.940
that we brought back from Milan to last us the rest of the week.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.794
Oh, good. Well, everything's in order,

07:09.885 --> 07:12.647
so, let's get going and get this stuff out of here.

07:13.702 --> 07:16.363
Wow, we sure have a lot of gifts.

07:16.629 --> 07:18.810
- Do we like this many people? 
- I didn't think so.

07:19.061 --> 07:21.174
Maybe we're getting soft in our old age.

07:21.261 --> 07:23.842
Okay, well, I guess we should get some tote bags.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.912
- What tote bags? 
- We must have tote bags.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.245
Where would we get tote bags?

07:27.339 --> 07:29.347
Excuse me, every woman who's ever purchased

07:29.434 --> 07:31.938
seventy-five dollars worth of Clinique products has some tote bags.

07:32.035 --> 07:32.947
We don't have tote bags.

07:33.730 --> 07:35.363
How are we supposed to get this stuff out of here?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.275
Now we're the quirky backpack ladies.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.686
One of the kinder nicknames that have been attributed to us.

07:42.065 --> 07:43.985
Let's just be very efficient about this.

07:44.140 --> 07:47.995
We'll start with Patty, work our way clockwise around the town, end with Andrew.

07:48.082 --> 07:50.395
And let's stick with the 'my mom touched the Pope' anecdote.

07:50.529 --> 07:53.074
It's quick, it's peppy, and everybody likes a nice Pope story.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.982
Do we have time to stop at Luke's? I'm starving.

07:55.085 --> 07:58.894
Absolutely. This is our week, this week we do anything we want.

07:58.985 --> 07:59.781
I like this week.

08:00.896 --> 08:03.493
I wonder if Luke and Nicole actually went on that cruise.

08:03.626 --> 08:04.552
I thought he was going.

08:04.748 --> 08:06.676
Yeah, I know, but I wonder if he actually went.

08:06.857 --> 08:08.536
- Why wouldn't he? 
- I don't know.

08:08.684 --> 08:12.130
Because he'd have to pack and leave, plus he'd have to buy a bathing suit.

08:12.227 --> 08:14.153
I hope he went. He could use a good vacation.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.781
Plus, he really seems to like Nicole.

08:16.961 --> 08:17.516
Yeah, he does.

08:18.326 --> 08:21.607
Oh, hey, looks like the soda shop is open.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.799
Oh, cool.

08:23.005 --> 08:24.029
I am gonna kill you.

08:24.178 --> 08:26.461
- Oh, please, you are not. 
- I am, too. I'm gonna kill you.

08:26.588 --> 08:28.254
I should've killed you before. I should've killed you

08:28.330 --> 08:32.376
the minute you put up those unicorn topiaries in the park, but, hey, hindsight, right?

08:32.511 --> 08:33.451
I've missed that.

08:34.115 --> 08:35.840
What do you think, biscotti moment?

08:36.030 --> 08:37.167
Absolutely.

08:37.631 --> 08:41.554
- You don't have to yell, Luke. 
- You put a giant window in my wall.

08:41.717 --> 08:44.075
- So what? 
- A giant window! Right here!

08:44.243 --> 08:46.015
You can see my entire diner.

08:46.106 --> 08:49.640
And when I'm in my diner, I can see your whole stupid store.

08:49.721 --> 08:53.352
I don't understand why yours is a diner and mine is a stupid store.

08:53.459 --> 08:55.687
Look at this place! Look at you.

08:55.891 --> 08:59.434
All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner

08:59.526 --> 09:01.902
to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood.

09:02.030 --> 09:06.607
I don't think you had a childhood. I think you came out a bitter surly killjoy.

09:06.678 --> 09:09.982
You can't change the basic structure of this place without my okay!

09:10.942 --> 09:11.990
What?

09:12.470 --> 09:14.342
Your hand is near the wax lips.

09:14.743 --> 09:15.414
So?

09:15.501 --> 09:18.737
If you could just move it so you don't accidentally touch the candy.

09:21.107 --> 09:21.778
Lucas.

09:22.838 --> 09:24.272
What are you doing?

09:24.988 --> 09:28.715
- You stop that right now! 
- Look at all the pretty candy!

09:28.992 --> 09:30.457
Stop it right now!

09:30.564 --> 09:31.198
Oh my God!

09:31.372 --> 09:32.556
What? What's the matter?

09:32.719 --> 09:33.329
Luke.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.885
Yeah, he's finally lost it.

09:34.983 --> 09:36.094
No, we forgot Luke.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.041
We forgot Luke what?

09:37.546 --> 09:41.076
Oh, we forgot to bring him back a gift. Oh no!

09:41.183 --> 09:42.760
We kept putting it off and putting it off.

09:42.837 --> 09:44.214
We couldn't find anything good enough.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.201
We should've gotten him that bullfighter's uniform.

09:46.283 --> 09:47.173
So what do we do?

09:47.312 --> 09:50.195
We have to just pick up something here

09:50.270 --> 09:52.611
and we'll tell him that we got it in Denmark.

09:52.765 --> 09:54.106
- Pick up what? 
- Something.

09:54.367 --> 09:55.790
What? This is Stars Hollow.

09:55.913 --> 09:58.397
Everything you buy here has a Hello, Kitty stamped on the bottom.

09:58.489 --> 10:01.264
Well, we have to get him something. We cannot go into Luke's empty handed.

10:01.490 --> 10:02.144
Great.

10:02.621 --> 10:03.174
Come on.

10:04.490 --> 10:05.212
I'm hungry.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.406
Hey, Sookie!

10:09.855 --> 10:11.274
- You're back! 
- We're back!

10:13.132 --> 10:14.458
Hey, don't squish baby!

10:14.796 --> 10:17.187
- I missed you so much! 
- We missed you so much.

10:17.515 --> 10:19.656
Ah, look at you! You look older.

10:19.773 --> 10:20.755
Oh, thanks, Sookie.

10:20.929 --> 10:22.185
So how was it, was it wonderful?

10:22.338 --> 10:24.899
I wanna hear everything you did and everything you ate.

10:24.985 --> 10:26.753
Oh, was it warm? I read it was warm.

10:26.941 --> 10:28.703
How was Barcelona? Did you see the gaudy apartments?

10:28.892 --> 10:31.646
Did you see a bullfight? Did you see Anne Frank's house?

10:31.749 --> 10:33.915
Did you cry? Was Steven Speilberg there, huh?

10:34.028 --> 10:36.648
Hey, I hear you touched the Pope! Are you hungry?

10:36.746 --> 10:38.488
Do you want anything to eat? I've got quiche.

10:38.645 --> 10:40.873
Hold on one sec here, missy. I need to look at you.

10:41.297 --> 10:42.537
- Sideways, please. 
- Okay.

10:42.855 --> 10:45.594
Hello, hi, nice to see you.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.866
I'm your Auntie Lorelai, and this is your Auntie Rory. Say hi, Rory.

10:49.988 --> 10:52.387
- Come over here. 
- Oh, no, I'm good.

10:52.574 --> 10:54.190
Come on, Rory, rub my stomach.

10:54.328 --> 10:55.168
I'd rather not.

10:55.848 --> 10:57.559
- Rory's a chicken. 
- So is Jackson.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.837
Hey, I'm gonna like it when it comes out.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.787
So what did the ultrasound say, boy or girl?

11:02.918 --> 11:04.242
- It's a... 
- Buh-buh-buh...

11:04.953 --> 11:06.110
It's a buh? What's a buh?

11:06.437 --> 11:07.231
Read.

11:08.295 --> 11:09.914
"I do not want to know the sex of my baby."

11:10.324 --> 11:12.653
That's right. I'm going old school on this.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.516
And he's being completely stubborn.

11:14.594 --> 11:15.550
But you know?

11:15.652 --> 11:18.337
Of course I know. I had little clothes to buy...

11:19.429 --> 11:22.023
What? I said nothing about the sex.

11:22.161 --> 11:24.977
You said little, and now I know it's going to be little.

11:25.028 --> 11:27.103
Jackson, seriously, you don't wanna know?

11:27.214 --> 11:31.207
Hey, in the old days, the guys would pace back and forth in the waiting room

11:31.262 --> 11:34.168
until a pretty nurse in a nice white outfit would come out and say,

11:34.274 --> 11:37.572
"Congratulations - it's a 'insert your chosen sex here'."

11:37.689 --> 11:40.148
Ricky Ricardo didn't know, Dick van Dyke didn't know,

11:40.235 --> 11:43.563
and by gum, if it was good enough for Rick and Dick, it's good enough for me.

11:43.625 --> 11:44.987
Well, I wanna know.

11:45.017 --> 11:46.717
Rory, what do you say? Be on my side.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.574
Jackson, there are no sides.

11:49.651 --> 11:52.523
We can be in that waiting room together, pacing, waiting,

11:52.599 --> 11:54.239
we'll get you a nice suit. What do you say?

11:54.494 --> 11:56.890
Okay, sure. I'm on Jackson's side.

11:57.065 --> 11:59.266
Great. Welcome to 1954.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.212
- Happy to be here. 
- Well, I wanna know.

12:01.457 --> 12:03.020
Come on, I'll tell you outside.

12:03.213 --> 12:04.069
Sure you don't wanna go?

12:04.197 --> 12:05.329
Read the button, missy.

12:09.012 --> 12:11.575
So, you hear about that whole Sputnik thing?

12:11.939 --> 12:13.895
Oh, Eisenhower's on top of it.

12:15.575 --> 12:18.130
So Jackson's really not gonna be in the delivery room with you?

12:18.257 --> 12:19.538
- Nope. 
- Does that bug you?

12:19.703 --> 12:21.973
Hey, I don't like Jackson to see me shave my legs, so...

12:22.184 --> 12:23.336
I'm opening the shed!

12:25.133 --> 12:27.264
- Okay, are you ready? 
- For what?

12:30.837 --> 12:33.070
- It's a boy! 
- It's a boy!

12:33.376 --> 12:35.624
Oh, Sookie, you're having a boy!

12:35.742 --> 12:39.076
I know! Jackson will finally have that son to prune the trees with.

12:39.746 --> 12:42.628
My God, it's so exciting. A boy!

12:42.807 --> 12:46.627
Oh, a little boy. I know nothing about little boys.

12:46.776 --> 12:47.594
Me neither.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.927
- Man, you're prepared, aren't you? 
- Yes, I am.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.331
- It's so nice to be home. 
- It's nice to have you home.

12:55.751 --> 12:57.470
- Hey, have you seen Luke lately? 
- Briefly.

12:57.575 --> 12:59.591
I guess he went on that cruise, huh?

12:59.745 --> 13:01.987
That's good. That's good he went.

13:02.258 --> 13:04.742
He needed a vacation. He works hard, that one.

13:04.858 --> 13:07.886
Always cooking, making the coffee, taking the orders.

13:08.060 --> 13:11.122
You know, I think something happened on that trip of his.

13:11.744 --> 13:12.705
What do you mean?

13:12.846 --> 13:15.387
Well, the day he got back, Jackson and I went into the diner

13:15.462 --> 13:16.656
and I asked him how his trip went.

13:16.789 --> 13:18.581
He couldn't get away from me fast enough.

13:18.683 --> 13:21.069
Really? Was Jackson wearing that creepy button?

13:21.143 --> 13:23.890
Nope. Luke just seemed kind of freaked out about something.

13:23.984 --> 13:25.228
- What? 
- I don't know.

13:25.447 --> 13:27.812
You think he and Nicole had a fight or something?

13:27.966 --> 13:29.840
- I don't know. 
- He didn't say anything?

13:29.936 --> 13:33.096
Nope. He just walked around acting weirder than normal.

13:33.835 --> 13:35.769
Wonder what that's all about.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.941
So... are you gonna name him Lorelai?

13:44.053 --> 13:46.526
Absolutely. That wouldn't be confusing at all.

13:46.669 --> 13:47.243
Great.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.576
I cannot believe you.

13:53.695 --> 13:57.273
What? It's the perfect gift for Luke. Fine fancy jam from France.

13:57.366 --> 13:59.163
Fine fancy jam from Jackson's pantry.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.087
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.392
I am looking right here at this beautiful hand-crafted label

14:03.483 --> 14:05.477
and it says "Fruits de la Terre."

14:05.547 --> 14:07.503
You didn't even spellcheck to make sure you got the French right.

14:07.627 --> 14:10.621
Yes, well, I think it adds an authentic touch.

14:10.852 --> 14:14.205
See, in my world, the person who made this jam

14:14.390 --> 14:17.457
was an illiterate orphan... Sochelle.

14:17.785 --> 14:19.782
- As in Sochelle Crab. 
- Yes, exactly.

14:19.874 --> 14:23.502
Sochelle was born by the sea, or so said the note left in the bassinet

14:23.601 --> 14:25.788
when the nuns found her on the steps of Notre Dame.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.982
- Oh, good, there are nuns. 
- Every sad story needs nuns.

14:29.228 --> 14:33.953
Anyhow, Sochelle had nothing - no father, no mother, no friends, no education.

14:34.056 --> 14:36.866
All she had was a burning desire to make great jam,

14:37.025 --> 14:39.718
and now she's the most successful jamstress in Paris.

14:39.832 --> 14:41.387
- Luke's gonna know. 
- No, he is not.

14:41.479 --> 14:44.096
As much as I would like to be there when you give Luke your heartfelt gift,

14:44.184 --> 14:45.514
I'm gonna go give Lane her gift.

14:45.606 --> 14:47.614
All right, but if you're not there, I'm gonna get all the credit for this.

14:47.680 --> 14:48.741
Exactly as it should be.

14:49.032 --> 14:50.649
- Give Lane a hug for me. 
- I will.

14:51.983 --> 14:54.945
- Don't give him the jam. 
- I can't hear you, I'm too far away.

15:01.007 --> 15:04.310
Bonjour, Luke. Pouvez-vous attacher vos chaussures?

15:04.627 --> 15:06.055
- What? 
- Hi, Luke.

15:06.214 --> 15:07.315
Do you know how to tie your shoes?

15:07.439 --> 15:08.273
Very good.

15:08.513 --> 15:10.136
It came in handy, let me tell you.

15:10.223 --> 15:12.052
Not one shoelace fatality on my watch.

15:13.655 --> 15:15.001
You remembered.

15:15.108 --> 15:17.478
A couple things about you stick. You have a good time?

15:17.770 --> 15:19.675
- Vos odeurs de chat. 
- What's that?

15:19.743 --> 15:20.525
Your cat smells.

15:20.632 --> 15:22.271
You must've been a big hit with the salon set.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.652
The trip was incredible, we had the best time.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.004
We were supposed to come back on Saturday.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.211
- I know. 
- Keeping tabs on me?

15:27.350 --> 15:30.001
Always safer to know which direction the tornado's coming from.

15:30.110 --> 15:32.834
Anyhow, we were in London and we ran into this group of girls

15:32.926 --> 15:35.757
who were heading to Ireland to stake out the Clarence Hotel.

15:35.916 --> 15:36.818
Why?

15:36.997 --> 15:39.188
Because U2 owns it and Bono hangs out there.

15:39.326 --> 15:40.284
Him again.

15:40.371 --> 15:42.883
So then we jumped on a train and we headed to Ireland

15:42.956 --> 15:46.915
- incredibly beautiful, by the way - and we sat in a bar for two days

15:46.981 --> 15:50.616
and did nothing but eat soda crackers and funky cheese and he never showed.

15:51.108 --> 15:51.900
Que sera.

15:52.956 --> 15:56.187
Still good. I told 'em about you over there, Señor Swanky-pants.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.849
Can't tell you how grateful I am to have you as my press agent.

15:58.941 --> 16:01.363
And we got you something.

16:01.876 --> 16:03.897
- You did? 
- Yes, we did.

16:04.016 --> 16:04.952
You didn't have to do that.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.714
What are you talking about?

16:06.907 --> 16:10.957
We do not go to Europe and come back without bringing something for Luke.

16:11.496 --> 16:12.084
Here.

16:13.104 --> 16:13.677
Jam.

16:13.897 --> 16:15.150
Yes, fancy French jam.

16:15.368 --> 16:17.485
Fruits de la Terre. Very impressive.

16:17.633 --> 16:20.552
It's handmade by this woman in Paris who has the most amazing story.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.585
- Really? 
- Yeah. Orphaned.

16:22.929 --> 16:24.945
- And illiterate. 
- Okay.

16:25.064 --> 16:26.952
Just had nothing in her life, you know,

16:27.061 --> 16:30.481
except this burning desire to be the world's greatest jamstress.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.558
And she's famous now and, you know,

16:33.635 --> 16:36.502
she only makes three bottles of that stuff a year and that's one of 'em,

16:36.569 --> 16:39.662
and I brought it all the way across the... I got it from Sookie's house.

16:39.762 --> 16:41.744
- No. 
- How did you know?

16:41.862 --> 16:43.387
Just a wild guess.

16:43.895 --> 16:46.660
I swear, we tried to get you something, but nothing was good enough.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.937
No, forget it. I didn't get you anything on my trip either. We're even.

16:50.049 --> 16:51.457
Oh, yeah, how was the cruise?

16:51.852 --> 16:53.117
Oh, it was... you know.

16:53.408 --> 16:54.908
Not really, I've never been on a cruise.

16:56.444 --> 16:57.965
- So... 
- It was fine.

16:58.220 --> 17:01.502
Okay. So, you and Nicole had fun then?

17:01.636 --> 17:02.793
Yeah... You want more coffee?

17:04.042 --> 17:05.409
So what did you?

17:05.829 --> 17:07.201
- Where? 
- On the boat?

17:07.324 --> 17:08.512
What did you and Nicole do on the boat?

17:08.819 --> 17:12.675
Oh, you know, we fluttered around and ate,

17:12.789 --> 17:15.967
and there was a magic show and a singer

17:16.042 --> 17:20.170
and pillow mints, and you know, that's it.

17:20.416 --> 17:23.344
But you and Nicole had a good time, you got along, and...

17:23.446 --> 17:25.295
Yeah. I'm gonna go check on your food.

17:27.758 --> 17:29.571
I didn't order anything yet.

17:32.269 --> 17:33.052
Hi, Kirk.

17:33.452 --> 17:34.855
Bienvenido, señora Gilmore.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.459
What are you doing? I just put that there.

17:44.896 --> 17:47.609
Scoop toward you, rolling smoothly.

17:47.701 --> 17:49.401
Very good, Ginger.

17:49.504 --> 17:52.349
Nice symmetrical balls there, Joshua.

17:52.499 --> 17:55.273
Easy on the nuts, easy on the nuts.

17:55.437 --> 18:00.395
One cherry, and then present your sundae with a Taylor Tip.

18:01.378 --> 18:02.611
Excuse me, Taylor.

18:02.876 --> 18:05.754
Ah, there you are. Hello, your majesty.

18:05.805 --> 18:07.521
Come to check on your little kingdom?

18:07.613 --> 18:09.026
Ginger, hand me a spoon.

18:09.281 --> 18:12.655
- I was just walking by when I... 
- Here you are, on the house.

18:12.749 --> 18:14.211
- Thank you. 
- Would you like an extra cherry?

18:14.294 --> 18:17.924
Because if the Stars Hollow Ice Cream Queen wants two cherries,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.888
then she will get two cherries, and to hell with the extra twenty-five cent charge.

18:21.999 --> 18:25.548
Taylor, you didn't ask me if I wanted to be the Ice Cream Queen.

18:25.769 --> 18:28.242
- So? 
- So, you didn't ask me.

18:28.328 --> 18:30.940
You just put my picture on a flier and stuck it up all over town.

18:31.047 --> 18:33.474
Well, I couldn't very well ask you when you were traipsing all over Europe,

18:33.556 --> 18:34.724
- now could I? 
- But...

18:34.786 --> 18:36.363
And don't worry about getting anything.

18:36.413 --> 18:38.999
I have already rented a cape and a crown.

18:39.123 --> 18:44.047
Just wear a nice simple sage-colored floor-length dress and you'll be fine.

18:44.140 --> 18:45.311
I can't do it.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.490
What do you mean, you can't do it?

18:46.613 --> 18:50.534
I mean, I'm busy right now. I only have a couple days left before I go off to school,

18:50.590 --> 18:52.460
and my mom and I have every moment planned,

18:52.521 --> 18:54.640
so I'm just going to have to pass on this one.

18:55.292 --> 18:57.472
Oh, I see.

18:57.999 --> 19:00.903
You're going to pass. You're passing on this.

19:01.154 --> 19:03.897
Fine. Just consider yourself passed.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.961
- Look, I can still come by. 
- Oh, can you, really?

19:09.058 --> 19:11.485
You can find time in your busy day to come by

19:11.557 --> 19:13.908
and eat my free ice cream and take my free balloon

19:14.035 --> 19:17.845
and get yourself a free glitter hand stamp? You can swing that?

19:17.936 --> 19:19.745
You don't have to pass on that, huh?

19:20.005 --> 19:22.882
- Look, Taylor, don't take it like this. 
- In my own defense,

19:23.006 --> 19:28.156
I assumed you would be thrilled based on your past participation record.

19:28.239 --> 19:29.283
But this has nothing to do with...

19:29.374 --> 19:32.897
You've always been the head pilgrim girl at the food drive table.

19:32.974 --> 19:34.157
Yes, that's for charity.

19:34.255 --> 19:37.403
The third leprechaun at the St. Patty's Day festival.

19:37.537 --> 19:39.835
Yes, okay, but again, for charity.

19:39.876 --> 19:41.741
You man the ticket booth on Groundhog Day.

19:41.822 --> 19:44.376
You help organize the manger procession at Christmas,

19:44.463 --> 19:47.367
you play Esther every year at the Purim carnival.

19:47.464 --> 19:51.068
I just assumed you liked taking part in town events.

19:51.202 --> 19:53.219
I do like it, but I just can't this time. I'm sorry.

19:53.327 --> 19:55.989
Oh, don't be. It's my own fault.

19:56.132 --> 20:00.673
I should have figured that once you got into Yale everything would be different.

20:00.812 --> 20:03.736
- That's not fair. 
- No, I understand.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.752
You're no longer our little Stars Hollow Rory Gilmore.

20:06.829 --> 20:08.968
You belong to the Ivy Leagues right now.

20:09.055 --> 20:13.013
It's time to cut those small town ties and go off and do something important

20:13.100 --> 20:17.305
like go to drama school or have one of those high-class naked parties

20:17.375 --> 20:18.920
- with that Bush girl. 
- Taylor...

20:18.988 --> 20:21.160
Okay. See you around the quad.

20:39.099 --> 20:41.926
Okay, that took way longer than it was supposed to.

20:42.090 --> 20:44.128
From now on, when we go out of town, no presents for anyone.

20:44.363 --> 20:47.441
Oh, right. So we'll just buy everyone a big crate of Fruits de la Terre.

20:47.927 --> 20:49.513
That horse is dead, put the stick down.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.898
Now we're way behind in our schedule, so I propose a change.

20:53.008 --> 20:54.992
Let's hold off on the frivolous shopping until tomorrow.

20:55.398 --> 20:56.360
What's up?

20:58.253 --> 21:00.061
That Taylor thing is still bugging me.

21:00.182 --> 21:02.581
Me, too. I can't believe you didn't call me in to see the fight.

21:02.687 --> 21:05.303
Maybe I am different. Maybe I do have an attitude.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.344
I think you do.

21:06.456 --> 21:09.517
I mean, I've always had time for the town in the past, and now suddenly I don't?

21:09.640 --> 21:11.505
Am I changing? I don't wanna change.

21:11.596 --> 21:14.080
I don't wanna be the anti-town girl. I'm not Daria.

21:14.177 --> 21:17.178
Taylor is just messing with your mind, which is one of his specialties. Ignore him.

21:17.351 --> 21:18.059
I guess.

21:18.493 --> 21:21.986
Hey, hey, no mail yet. We agreed, we're still on vacation.

21:22.205 --> 21:25.114
I'll just look through my mail. Yours can sit there as long as you like.

21:25.221 --> 21:26.675
Yeah, but then you're back in the real world again

21:26.756 --> 21:29.209
and I'm out here in vacation-land alone. That's not fun.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.371
Oh no.

21:33.029 --> 21:34.170
- What? 
- Oh no.

21:34.688 --> 21:35.410
What oh no?

21:42.292 --> 21:44.016
Hey, kid, you're kind of freaking me out here.

21:46.910 --> 21:48.799
- I wrote the date down wrong. 
- What date?

21:48.989 --> 21:51.763
This is from Yale. My orientation is Saturday.

21:51.861 --> 21:53.534
- Right, next Saturday. 
- No, this Saturday.

21:53.678 --> 21:55.783
- No, next Saturday. 
- No, this Saturday.

21:55.988 --> 21:58.388
But today's Thursday. That means we have no...

21:58.459 --> 22:00.385
I have to be at school the day after tomorrow.

22:00.703 --> 22:04.667
But... no! We had a free week. I had it all scheduled out.

22:04.779 --> 22:06.074
I wrote the date down wrong.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.543
- Why would you do that? 
- I don't know.

22:07.621 --> 22:08.972
You never write the date down wrong.

22:09.075 --> 22:11.214
I wrote it down before we left and I wrote it down wrong.

22:11.322 --> 22:12.444
We were supposed to have a week.

22:12.561 --> 22:13.406
Well, we don't.

22:13.548 --> 22:15.847
I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong.

22:15.976 --> 22:18.223
I can't believe you weren't gonna let me open the mail.

22:18.409 --> 22:20.168
I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong.

22:20.267 --> 22:22.555
I can't believe you made us go to Ireland to stalk Bono.

22:22.678 --> 22:24.772
This isn't fair. You have more I-can't-believe's than I do.

22:24.870 --> 22:26.800
- This sucks. 
- This totally sucks.

22:26.932 --> 22:29.529
Well, I'm not ready. I haven't packed. I have things I need to get.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.489
We were supposed to watch the three Godfather's

22:31.577 --> 22:34.290
and Sofia dying over and over and eat our biscotti and...

22:34.397 --> 22:36.979
Okay, listen, calm down. We just need to revise our plan.

22:37.112 --> 22:38.433
We were supposed to have a week.

22:38.601 --> 22:42.016
Okay, tonight we stay home and pack. Tomorrow we get up early.

22:42.129 --> 22:44.510
We'll get all the stuff you need, and that will give us time

22:44.556 --> 22:46.332
to watch at least two Godfather's and a Sofia dying.

22:46.435 --> 22:49.395
We'll still have a partial day and a great biscotti night.

22:49.661 --> 22:50.743
Chinese.

22:50.867 --> 22:52.351
- What? 
- Food. Order it. Go.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.412
No, no time for full sentences!

22:53.500 --> 22:54.743
- Right. 
- Ordering!

22:57.730 --> 23:00.746
I'm so wiped. I shouldn't have taken that third Excedrin PM last night.

23:00.874 --> 23:02.307
Third? Why'd you take three?

23:02.482 --> 23:05.570
Oh, well, originally I took two,

23:05.625 --> 23:07.376
then somewhere around four in the morning, I woke up

23:07.423 --> 23:08.704
and had a major Marilyn moment.

23:08.991 --> 23:12.031
I forgot that I'd taken something and so I popped a third one

23:12.092 --> 23:13.572
and now I'm about ready to sleep with a Kennedy.

23:13.680 --> 23:14.841
I hear Kerry's available.

23:14.919 --> 23:19.726
Okay, let's sit. God, Mr. Jet Lag wants to be my best friend.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.197
Do you wanna go home and rest?

23:21.361 --> 23:24.432
No. We have a Godfather night to salvage. Check the list.

23:24.958 --> 23:28.922
Okay, we got the sheets, towels, bathroom shower caddy,

23:29.030 --> 23:30.817
and the basic first aid accoutrement.

23:31.021 --> 23:35.081
We still need to hit the beauty supply, the hardware store, stationery store.

23:35.139 --> 23:36.006
The mattress store.

23:36.172 --> 23:38.348
You do know that they supply you with a mattress at the dorm.

23:38.493 --> 23:40.903
Yeah. A mattress that decades of students

23:41.015 --> 23:45.276
in various states of cleanliness have slept on. Some without pajamas.

23:45.480 --> 23:46.699
- Gross. 
- Exactly.

23:47.140 --> 23:49.825
We've been running around for hours and this list isn't getting any shorter.

23:49.921 --> 23:51.967
- We're never gonna finish. 
- Stop. Yes, we are.

23:52.111 --> 23:54.727
We just need to split up. We'll get all this done quicker.

23:54.829 --> 23:57.491
I'll take the beauty supply and you take the stationery store,

23:57.610 --> 23:59.028
and we'll meet back here in twenty minutes.

24:01.802 --> 24:03.728
- Oh, boy. 
- What?

24:03.861 --> 24:06.549
I'm gonna walk right past that stupid grand opening.

24:06.733 --> 24:08.193
I would take the stationery store,

24:08.254 --> 24:10.103
but you're so weird about what kind of pens you like.

24:10.201 --> 24:13.395
No, no. I'll just... I'll walk really fast. Maybe Taylor won't notice me.

24:13.887 --> 24:18.013
Yeah. You better walk really fast, like warp speed Mr. Sulu kind of fast.

24:18.173 --> 24:19.867
- Let's go. 
- Twenty minutes!

24:20.054 --> 24:23.435
…since these and many other flavors await your tongues

24:23.675 --> 24:27.751
at Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store.

24:27.906 --> 24:30.491
I wanna thank you all for coming here today

24:30.675 --> 24:33.521
to help us celebrate our grand opening.

24:33.710 --> 24:38.965
Now, originally we were supposed to have our Ice Cream Queen here,

24:39.040 --> 24:43.447
but unfortunately, kids, she was just too busy.

24:43.538 --> 24:47.868
She just couldn't find time in her busy queen schedule

24:47.971 --> 24:51.037
to come play with all of you here today.

24:52.435 --> 24:55.794
I know, Christy, but take heart,

24:55.871 --> 24:58.426
we still have balloons and music,

24:58.517 --> 25:00.484
and as a special treat a little later,

25:00.596 --> 25:05.927
a skydiver is going to drop from the sky and land right here

25:05.989 --> 25:10.068
in front of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store.

25:10.136 --> 25:12.045
Isn't that great, kids?

25:12.205 --> 25:18.861
A skydiver who isn't too busy to come play with you will be here soon.

25:19.864 --> 25:21.414
- Hey, Kirk. 
- Hello.

25:22.101 --> 25:26.038
Hey, I'm looking for a good daytime cream and a good nighttime cream.

25:26.187 --> 25:27.621
- For you? 
- No, for Rory.

25:27.774 --> 25:30.508
Is she sensitive, prone to breakouts if the cream is too heavy?

25:30.957 --> 25:35.351
I thought so. Okay, first of all, I would stay far away from that one.

25:35.541 --> 25:37.031
Much too rich for her.

25:37.266 --> 25:41.164
This one is light with a fresh citrus scent and it is completely natural.

25:41.265 --> 25:42.007
We like that.

25:42.152 --> 25:44.373
Now, for day, I would recommend something with a sunscreen.

25:44.537 --> 25:47.086
Rory has a classic peaches and cream complexion,

25:47.221 --> 25:49.223
and it would be a crime if, when she got older,

25:49.309 --> 25:51.152
her face started to look like a cowboy.

25:51.254 --> 25:53.666
- I couldn't agree more. 
- All right. This should work.

25:53.871 --> 25:54.486
Thank you.

25:55.386 --> 25:57.685
You know, I heard you got back from your trip.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.052
Yup, I'm living proof.

25:59.603 --> 26:01.873
Miss Patty showed me the castanets you brought her.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.154
- Oh yeah? 
- Yeah.

26:03.686 --> 26:07.050
And Andrew showed me the T-shirt from the Picasso museum.

26:07.470 --> 26:09.138
I must admit, I was a little jealous.

26:09.257 --> 26:11.782
I mean, I hate Picasso, but I love T-shirts.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.539
And Pete seemed to really enjoy the Tower of London nutcracker you brought him.

26:15.888 --> 26:18.452
A nutcracker's a very useful thing to have around.

26:18.689 --> 26:20.956
I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in my living room

26:21.023 --> 26:23.865
with a nut thinking, "if only I had a way to crack this."

26:23.951 --> 26:27.167
Okay, Kirk, I'm really sorry, we got a little messed up on the presents.

26:27.557 --> 26:29.793
It just got so crazy over there.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.811
I mean, we forgot to bring something back for Luke.

26:31.943 --> 26:33.905
- I heard he got jam. 
- Fake jam.

26:34.017 --> 26:35.005
I love fake jam.

26:35.114 --> 26:37.439
You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you, okay?

26:38.247 --> 26:40.167
- Really? 
- I promise.

26:40.464 --> 26:42.039
We never meant to forget you.

26:43.414 --> 26:45.251
Okay, well, sure.

26:45.466 --> 26:47.070
You can make it up to me.

26:47.575 --> 26:49.547
Now how much do I owe you?

26:49.812 --> 26:53.775
45.50. You're lucky you came in when you did.

26:53.870 --> 26:57.483
- I'm closing a little early today. 
- Well, lucky me.

27:00.754 --> 27:02.301
Kirk, no.

27:02.946 --> 27:05.937
Taylor paid me twenty dollars to jump out of a plane for the grand opening.

27:06.354 --> 27:09.591
But I took a lesson. The guy said I was a natural at falling.

27:09.777 --> 27:13.811
Kirk, listen to me, this is the best gift I could possibly give you -

27:14.061 --> 27:15.532
don't do that, okay?

27:15.946 --> 27:17.702
Do I still get the jam?

27:22.314 --> 27:23.448
Thanks a lot.

27:23.548 --> 27:24.670
Yale can have you.

27:25.924 --> 27:28.162
Honey. Hey, did you get your silly pens?

27:28.585 --> 27:30.875
Okay, good. Now I can mark these two things off,

27:30.973 --> 27:33.159
and we only have about ten thousand other things to do.

27:33.277 --> 27:33.881
Great.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.956
You know, I think the only way we're gonna get this all done is if we prioritize.

27:38.112 --> 27:39.810
- Meaning? 
- Something has to go.

27:40.045 --> 27:42.657
- Biscotti night. 
- No, not biscotti night.

27:42.759 --> 27:44.937
I think we should bail on Friday night dinner.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.383
- Cancel on Grandma? 
- Yes, cancel on Grandma.

27:47.450 --> 27:48.422
I can't do that.

27:48.617 --> 27:50.332
Rory, we need to get this stuff before tomorrow.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.286
There's no way we can do that if we have to drive all the way to Hartford and back.

27:53.359 --> 27:56.297
She'll understand. Well, the first part was true.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.476
I can't skip dinner.

27:57.644 --> 28:00.137
Come on, we're gonna go to dinner next week

28:00.214 --> 28:02.943
and every week after that for the rest of our lives.

28:03.013 --> 28:07.223
And I do mean the rest of our lives because my parents will outlive us.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.565
The damned can do that.

28:08.656 --> 28:11.887
Mom, I made a deal. This is why I get to go to Yale. I can't back out.

28:12.031 --> 28:13.884
- It's our last night. 
- I have to go.

28:13.997 --> 28:15.144
You don't have to, but I do.

28:15.282 --> 28:16.552
What do you mean I don't have to go?

28:16.685 --> 28:19.189
I was very clear when I made this deal that it was only for me.

28:19.645 --> 28:21.273
You're right, I don't have to go.

28:21.421 --> 28:24.769
Boy, that's an oddly liberating feeling. I don't have to go.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.960
I don't have to go. I do not have to go to dinner.

28:27.058 --> 28:28.103
- Mom. 
- Hang on, I'm not done.

28:28.205 --> 28:30.637
I do not have to go ever if I'm not in the mood.

28:30.739 --> 28:31.297
Mom.

28:31.630 --> 28:33.699
I'm not going. I'll finish up all the errands.

28:33.848 --> 28:34.606
- Really? 
- Yes.

28:34.698 --> 28:37.779
You go and you eat really fast and then get out of there.

28:37.857 --> 28:39.888
Meet me back here 9:30, 10 at the latest,

28:39.996 --> 28:43.212
and we'll do Godfather I through "Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,"

28:43.329 --> 28:44.810
- and a quick Sofia dying. 
- Deal.

28:44.876 --> 28:45.663
Remember, eat fast.

28:47.534 --> 28:50.041
Now just picture her sitting here just like this,

28:50.144 --> 28:55.844
smiling and waving. 'Hello kids, I'm the Ice Cream Queen.'

28:57.037 --> 29:01.430
Okay, that's it. I humiliate myself at least six times a year for this town,

29:01.511 --> 29:04.398
and just because I'm going to Yale, that's not going to stop.

29:04.522 --> 29:07.230
Now the reason I am not the Ice Cream Queen

29:07.295 --> 29:08.981
is because Taylor never asked me.

29:09.242 --> 29:11.177
I didn't know about it, and that's why I was busy.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.144
Now I love this town, I will be back

29:13.292 --> 29:15.724
in that ridiculous pilgrim outfit at Thanksgiving,

29:15.852 --> 29:17.844
so everybody just get off my back.

29:23.952 --> 29:27.766
Richard, they're here! Put those papers away and fix your tie.

29:29.553 --> 29:31.259
- Hey, Grandma. 
- Hello, Rory.

29:31.417 --> 29:33.732
- Nice to see you. 
- It's nice to see you, too.

29:33.931 --> 29:34.597
Come on in.

29:35.427 --> 29:36.419
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

29:36.937 --> 29:39.067
Well, you're here now and that's all that matters.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.839
Shall we go into the living room?

29:40.992 --> 29:42.421
Yes. Then I can give you your present.

29:42.870 --> 29:45.968
My present? Well, that sounds very interesting.

29:46.255 --> 29:49.046
We bought it for you in Paris because Mom said you loved Paris the most.

29:49.609 --> 29:50.884
I wonder what it could be.

29:53.659 --> 29:54.432
For you.

29:56.716 --> 30:01.810
Oh my, it's lovely, Rory, really. Just beautiful.

30:02.046 --> 30:03.818
It was between this and the Arc de Triumphe,

30:03.910 --> 30:05.994
but Mom said that the Eiffel Tower was fancier.

30:06.188 --> 30:08.355
I agree, and I love it. Thank you.

30:08.497 --> 30:09.161
You're welcome.

30:09.936 --> 30:13.110
So, where is your mother tonight? Not sick, I hope.

30:13.417 --> 30:15.804
Oh, no, she's fine. She just had some things to do.

30:15.977 --> 30:17.074
Ah, things.

30:17.836 --> 30:20.539
- Errands, actually. 
- Errands, of course.

30:20.827 --> 30:24.093
But she'll be here next week, and she says she's looking forward to it.

30:24.641 --> 30:27.232
Emily, I'm expecting a call and there's nothing I can do about it,

30:27.324 --> 30:29.049
so please don't be upset when I leave the table.

30:29.223 --> 30:31.138
Rory, how lovely to see you.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.388
Well, how was the first European excursion?

30:34.528 --> 30:35.235
It was perfect.

30:35.556 --> 30:37.967
Lorelai had chores to do tonight.

30:38.362 --> 30:40.191
- Chores? 
- Errands, you know.

30:40.318 --> 30:40.861
Errands?

30:41.085 --> 30:43.487
Yes, that's why she didn't come, she had to run errands.

30:43.697 --> 30:46.944
But she'll be here next week, and she's looking forward to it. Isn't that nice?

30:47.210 --> 30:49.085
- I suppose. 
- I think so, too.

30:49.432 --> 30:50.830
Would you like to see my present?

30:50.926 --> 30:52.100
Well, that's very nice.

30:53.072 --> 30:54.773
That'll fit right in with your collection, Emily.

30:54.859 --> 30:55.638
Yes, it will.

30:56.109 --> 30:57.373
We got something for you, too, Grandpa.

30:57.737 --> 31:01.786
Well, I guess you're not the only one who gets a treat tonight.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.661
Oh, and just when I thought I was special.

31:04.193 --> 31:06.779
Look at that. That's beautiful.

31:07.372 --> 31:09.800
We found this amazing pipe store in Copenhagen

31:09.892 --> 31:11.602
and the man there can carve anything you want.

31:11.673 --> 31:13.808
His family's been doing it for over a hundred and fifty years.

31:13.957 --> 31:17.147
And they had a whole set of Alice in Wonderland pipes that Mom wanted to get,

31:17.218 --> 31:19.798
but they were way too expensive so we just got the Queen of Hearts.

31:19.958 --> 31:20.988
Well, I love it.

31:21.330 --> 31:23.797
Yes, and you're gonna love it outside on the patio.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.433
As you wish, my dear.

31:26.717 --> 31:28.442
That's my call, that's my call.

31:28.723 --> 31:30.563
Hurry back, or we'll start without you.

31:30.659 --> 31:31.949
Five minutes. Ten, tops.

31:33.065 --> 31:33.972
He'll be an hour.

31:34.438 --> 31:35.692
Is his new business going well?

31:35.840 --> 31:38.001
Oh, who knows? He's not in the room long enough to find out.

31:38.114 --> 31:39.936
Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore.

31:40.116 --> 31:41.063
All right, Gerta.

31:41.438 --> 31:43.142
Well, I guess we should go in and eat.

31:43.305 --> 31:44.088
What about Grandpa?

31:44.326 --> 31:45.440
Oh, we'll save him something.

31:57.198 --> 32:00.882
So, Rory, tell me, how were the Gundersons?

32:01.149 --> 32:03.044
- The who? 
- The Gundersons.

32:03.392 --> 32:04.431
Our friends in Zurich.

32:04.898 --> 32:06.970
The ones we told you two to look up when you got there.

32:07.286 --> 32:09.444
Oh, the Gundersons, right.

32:09.741 --> 32:12.505
I tell ya, they better have given you a first class welcome.

32:12.777 --> 32:16.263
Especially after that son of theirs squatted here for over a month last year.

32:16.411 --> 32:17.769
And ruined the rug in the guest room.

32:17.885 --> 32:20.359
That's right. Hope you ruined one of their rugs as well.

32:20.887 --> 32:24.993
Actually, we didn't get a chance to see the Gundersons.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.816
Why not? Were they out of town?

32:27.041 --> 32:29.402
- Well, I... 
- You did go to Zurich, didn't you?

32:29.642 --> 32:32.065
Yes, but, you know, Zurich was so crazy for us

32:32.192 --> 32:35.054
that we just figured, 'Ah, we'll just catch 'em next time.'

32:35.188 --> 32:35.961
You didn't call them?

32:36.292 --> 32:37.711
You know, there really wasn't time.

32:38.002 --> 32:40.262
Well, what about the Egerholms in Denmark?

32:40.594 --> 32:42.145
Is their new house a monstrosity?

32:42.369 --> 32:46.543
Well, if you think Zurich was hectic, then Denmark was just... whoo!

32:46.926 --> 32:49.501
- You didn't call them? 
- No.

32:49.646 --> 32:51.351
- The Rezoscos in Florence? 
- No.

32:51.607 --> 32:52.810
The Talbots in London?

32:53.137 --> 32:54.690
We were only in London for two days.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.224
Well, who did you look up when you went to Europe?

32:57.644 --> 32:58.904
Jim Morrison says hello.

32:59.046 --> 33:00.614
You didn't look up one of our friends?

33:01.018 --> 33:02.799
We must've given you fifteen names.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.826
I know, but we got so caught up in the backpacking aspect of it

33:05.922 --> 33:07.669
that it just kind of slipped our minds.

33:08.027 --> 33:10.417
You know what that means, Emily. We're going to have to stay

33:10.468 --> 33:12.568
with the Gundersons when we go to Zurich in the fall.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.174
Rory, would you like another piece of chicken?

33:15.395 --> 33:17.468
- Tiresome people. 
- I've already had two, Grandma.

33:17.577 --> 33:19.282
I'm sorry, why are we friends with them again?

33:19.434 --> 33:21.277
Just take it and nibble at it if you want to.

33:21.592 --> 33:23.874
Gerta, you can put the soufflé in now.

33:24.456 --> 33:25.236
Soufflé?

33:25.584 --> 33:27.268
Yes, we're going to have a special dessert,

33:27.437 --> 33:29.086
something to celebrate your homecoming.

33:29.249 --> 33:31.456
Why didn't she put it in the oven when we sat down to dinner?

33:31.518 --> 33:32.628
Those things take forever to cook.

33:32.732 --> 33:35.604
You know, every time we go to Paris, I marvel at their ability

33:35.687 --> 33:38.779
to turn a simple meal into a three or four hour event.

33:38.951 --> 33:40.776
Makes every day seem like a party.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.498
So tonight, I thought we'd be European.

33:43.652 --> 33:46.877
I thought maybe we'd have a cheese plate before dessert and coffee.

33:47.021 --> 33:48.352
How does that sound? Bon?

33:48.624 --> 33:50.933
Oh, yes. Very... bon.

33:51.686 --> 33:53.344
It's nice to mix it up once in awhile.

33:53.653 --> 33:56.012
I have a wonderful idea.

33:56.191 --> 33:58.905
Rory, have you ever seen a ballroom dancing competition?

33:59.120 --> 34:00.220
No.

34:00.492 --> 34:04.347
You would love it. It is so exciting, and the costumes are beautiful.

34:04.681 --> 34:07.711
I've been taping them since 1978. Can you imagine?

34:08.078 --> 34:09.539
- No. 
- All right, then.

34:09.730 --> 34:13.152
After dessert, you and I are going to hunker down in that den

34:13.250 --> 34:15.571
that we never use and I am pulling out those tapes.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.879
We'll just start at the beginning and see how far we get.

34:18.177 --> 34:19.788
Perfect, here's the cheese.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.067
I'll take that, Gerta.

34:23.414 --> 34:24.623
Richard, do you want to start?

34:27.092 --> 34:31.463
Jeez, you think you go to a fancy school like Yale there'd be a mattress in the room.

34:31.601 --> 34:32.826
Yeah. Go figure, huh?

34:33.752 --> 34:35.257
You packed her stuff in Hefty bags?

34:35.333 --> 34:37.208
Hey, she's lucky I even had these in the house.

34:37.254 --> 34:38.487
If you needed luggage, you should've asked me.

34:38.585 --> 34:39.286
You have luggage?

34:39.429 --> 34:41.187
 Yes, I have luggage. Why wouldn't I have luggage?

34:41.456 --> 34:44.447
- You never go anywhere. 
- I just went on a seven-country cruise.

34:44.754 --> 34:48.164
That's right, the mystery cruise that you don't wanna talk about.

34:48.231 --> 34:51.032
I told you I brought luggage. What more info do you need?

34:51.110 --> 34:52.726
Why won't you tell me what happened?

34:52.813 --> 34:54.483
- Because. 
- Why?

34:54.554 --> 34:56.219
Luke, I swear, I'm dying to know,

34:56.275 --> 34:58.558
but every time I bring it up, you spaz out.

34:58.646 --> 35:00.293
Why won't you tell me? I would tell you.

35:00.392 --> 35:01.939
Yes, but I wouldn't wanna know.

35:06.061 --> 35:07.744
Did something happen with you and Nicole?

35:10.933 --> 35:12.808
What? Did you propose?

35:19.004 --> 35:21.026
Oh my God, you proposed?

35:21.947 --> 35:23.463
Yes, I proposed.

35:25.275 --> 35:29.193
- This is big. This is huge. 
- There's more.

35:29.484 --> 35:30.221
There's more?

35:31.019 --> 35:33.892
Okay, well, what? Did she say yes?

35:35.657 --> 35:38.229
She said yes. You proposed and she said yes.

35:38.485 --> 35:39.533
- Wow, I... 
- There's more.

35:39.617 --> 35:42.826
And there's more after you proposed and she said yes? What, you...

35:42.893 --> 35:43.825
We got married.

35:44.424 --> 35:47.854
You got married? How could you get married?

35:47.956 --> 35:49.666
We asked the captain and he married us.

35:49.753 --> 35:51.213
- And that's legal? 
- Apparently.

35:51.311 --> 35:53.661
So you're married? You're legally married?

35:54.283 --> 35:57.665
- This is just... 
- Actually, there's a little more.

35:58.489 --> 36:01.525
And she's pregnant. Oh my God, you finally reproduced.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.071
We're getting divorced.

36:06.502 --> 36:10.030
- I'm gonna sit down now. 
- It just all happened so fast.

36:10.121 --> 36:10.966
Well, yeah.

36:11.048 --> 36:13.695
I mean, you're on this boat in the middle of nowhere and everything's moving

36:13.783 --> 36:16.045
and you feel weird all the time.

36:16.116 --> 36:18.923
There's this endless supply of food and drink.

36:19.035 --> 36:22.046
Midnight buffets, by the way, are the reason the rest of the world hates us.

36:22.153 --> 36:25.020
And everyone around us was either in love, engaged,

36:25.113 --> 36:27.852
or celebrating their hundredth wedding anniversary,

36:27.923 --> 36:30.503
and we were having a good time... and there you go.

36:30.586 --> 36:31.216
There you go.

36:31.313 --> 36:34.042
Of course, the next morning we both woke up and realized we'd lost our minds.

36:34.114 --> 36:37.176
We tried to ignore it for awhile, you know, went snorkeling,

36:37.268 --> 36:40.883
but by the time we hit land, we were separated,

36:40.929 --> 36:42.408
and now we're getting divorced.

36:42.485 --> 36:45.593
Okay, well, my jet lag and your love life is making me dizzy.

36:45.885 --> 36:48.026
- Is there more? 
- Nope, that's it.

36:49.914 --> 36:52.448
- I'm sorry. 
- Ah, it's okay.

36:53.443 --> 36:56.457
Well, look on the bright side.

36:56.689 --> 37:00.958
I mean, now that you've been married, it'll silence all those questions.

37:01.807 --> 37:03.251
What questions?

37:03.370 --> 37:07.011
You know, a single man of a certain age who lives alone.

37:07.512 --> 37:08.289
You're kidding.

37:08.397 --> 37:09.995
Hey, I always defended you.

37:10.077 --> 37:12.493
I always said, "Hey, so what if he is?"

37:12.575 --> 37:13.841
Thank you for your support.

37:18.725 --> 37:20.767
- Hello? 
- She's taken me hostage.

37:20.932 --> 37:22.555
- What? 
- She's not letting me leave.

37:22.707 --> 37:25.519
Dinner lasted an hour. She didn't even put the soufflé in the oven

37:25.621 --> 37:28.069
until we'd already finished, and now we're watching

37:28.157 --> 37:32.466
taped ballroom dancing competitions that date back to the 1800's.

37:32.569 --> 37:34.628
- You haven't left yet? 
- Are you listening to me?

37:34.761 --> 37:37.501
I can't leave. She won't let me leave ever.

37:37.622 --> 37:41.116
This is Iran in '79 and you are Jimmy Carter. What do we do?

37:41.201 --> 37:43.282
Well, first we have to lose the Jimmy Carter comparison,

37:43.363 --> 37:45.267
and second, I have to come get you.

37:45.385 --> 37:47.644
This is about me and me not showing up,

37:47.773 --> 37:50.013
so maybe if I put in an appearance, she'll let you go.

37:50.172 --> 37:53.157
Okay, but come quickly because she's got a lot of tapes

37:53.234 --> 37:55.194
- and they rewind really slow. 
- I'm on my way.

37:58.008 --> 38:01.799
- Hey, so, I have to go get Rory. 
- Everything okay?

38:02.231 --> 38:04.615
Yeah. You know, my mother's a psycho, so...

38:05.189 --> 38:05.973
business as usual.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.804
- Thanks for the help. 
- Sure.

38:08.891 --> 38:11.595
- And I am sorry. 
- I'll be fine.

38:16.376 --> 38:17.232
Strong wind.

38:26.356 --> 38:29.832
Now I think you're really going to see quite a difference from the early eighties.

38:29.994 --> 38:32.018
They really start to mix it up in '88.

38:32.991 --> 38:34.466
Oh, see right there, see that move?

38:34.547 --> 38:36.032
Five years ago it was not allowed.

38:36.156 --> 38:37.558
Could've gotten you kicked right out.

38:37.768 --> 38:39.156
That's harsh.

38:39.596 --> 38:42.740
Oh, yes. Ballroom dancing can be very harsh.

38:43.693 --> 38:46.140
Oh, look. The couple in the purple feathers

38:46.293 --> 38:50.891
- that's Corky and Shirley Ballas. I love them, they are so talented.

38:51.341 --> 38:55.088
Corky's actually writing a musical based on their life as ballroom champions,

38:55.298 --> 38:58.551
and their son, Corky Jr., is going to play him as a young man.

38:58.893 --> 39:01.469
Wow. Two Corky's in one show.

39:01.658 --> 39:02.794
Don't see that everyday.

39:03.752 --> 39:06.225
- Mom, hi! 
- There you guys are.

39:06.471 --> 39:07.378
What are you doing here?

39:07.778 --> 39:09.949
Well, you know, it's funny, I just happen to be in the neighborhood

39:10.035 --> 39:12.437
and I thought to myself, I wonder what's doing at the Gilmore house.

39:12.626 --> 39:14.879
We're watching National Ballroom Dancing competitions.

39:15.156 --> 39:15.866
You are?

39:16.465 --> 39:18.947
Well, that sounds fun. Mind if I watch with you?

39:19.057 --> 39:21.310
- I don't think you'd enjoy it. 
- Oh, no, I'm sure I would.

39:21.411 --> 39:22.692
You've already missed the beginning.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.022
I'm betting you could catch me up.

39:24.509 --> 39:27.130
Rory, would you go ask Gerta if she would make me some tea?

39:27.874 --> 39:29.794
Sure, Grandma.

39:32.758 --> 39:34.120
No, nothing for me, Mom. Thanks.

39:35.681 --> 39:36.531
So what's new?

39:37.330 --> 39:39.936
You obviously weren't just in the neighborhood,

39:40.032 --> 39:41.845
so why don't you tell me what you're doing here?

39:42.188 --> 39:43.586
You know, I came to see you.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.113
You came to get Rory.

39:45.511 --> 39:49.137
Mom, she's been here for hours. Patty Hearst had a shorter incarceration.

39:49.248 --> 39:51.860
She's not being held hostage, Lorelai. I resent that.

39:51.932 --> 39:54.706
She's spending time with me, something you obviously don't want to do.

39:54.824 --> 39:56.970
Mom, I'm sorry I missed dinner tonight.

39:57.109 --> 39:59.725
Come to dinner, don't come to dinner, it makes no difference to me.

39:59.966 --> 40:02.132
You are under no obligation to us any longer.

40:02.228 --> 40:04.845
- I know, but... 
- You're very busy, I understand.

40:04.921 --> 40:06.279
I wouldn't wanna keep you any longer.

40:06.642 --> 40:09.233
Mom, please, let me take Rory with me.

40:09.381 --> 40:11.658
No. Tonight is my night with Rory.

40:11.767 --> 40:14.143
You're keeping her from me on purpose.

40:14.260 --> 40:17.850
If Rory wants to leave, she can ask to leave. She's not a four-year old.

40:17.910 --> 40:20.461
She's not gonna hurt your feelings by asking to leave.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.309
Why should she? She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her.

40:23.415 --> 40:25.571
Mom, why do you always make everything so hard?

40:25.616 --> 40:28.638
Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter!

40:28.800 --> 40:30.584
She goes off to college tomorrow!

40:30.670 --> 40:32.585
I know, which is why I was so surprised

40:32.637 --> 40:33.660
you didn't want to spend the evening with her.

40:33.738 --> 40:35.181
- I do! 
- Then you should've come!

40:35.268 --> 40:36.712
- I couldn't! 
- You wouldn't!

40:36.875 --> 40:38.386
I swear to God!

40:45.974 --> 40:46.880
Where's Dad?

40:47.867 --> 40:49.195
Oh, he went to bed hours ago.

40:52.399 --> 40:53.106
He went to bed?

40:53.690 --> 40:54.719
Well, it was getting late.

40:58.042 --> 40:58.953
Why are you laughing?

41:02.312 --> 41:05.461
You know, you've got Rory locked in here with the Mambo Kings, and...

41:06.972 --> 41:10.899
- and Dad went to bed. 
- So what? Why is that funny?

41:11.713 --> 41:16.002
Because... you know, she's here and he's there and...

41:16.408 --> 41:18.103
God, I'm so tired.

41:18.737 --> 41:20.969
- What's so funny? 
- Oh, she's having a fit.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.972
- Mom? 
- Oh my God.

41:25.925 --> 41:26.602
What?

41:27.380 --> 41:29.171
I just got the Jimmy Carter reference.

41:31.977 --> 41:33.559
As soon as you're both done...

41:39.970 --> 41:42.105
Oh, watch this. This part's really good.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.934
- Ouch, that has got to hurt. 
- Cool, huh?

41:47.190 --> 41:47.998
Extremely.

41:48.727 --> 41:52.038
Plus, the whole matching haircut thing adds a level of commitment to their act

41:52.079 --> 41:53.672
that the other acts just lack.

41:54.087 --> 41:56.232
Oh, hey, careful where you put the hand there, mister.

41:56.503 --> 41:59.053
You know they rehearse every night, plus they have classes,

41:59.154 --> 42:00.727
plus they go to the gym four times a week?

42:02.269 --> 42:05.617
Oh my God, she's balancing on his hand. He is like Superman.

42:05.899 --> 42:07.844
Or Wonder Woman. Either way, he's very strong.

42:10.242 --> 42:11.142
So, tomorrow...

42:15.023 --> 42:16.425
Yeah, tomorrow.

42:17.095 --> 42:17.823
It's a big day.

42:20.819 --> 42:22.171
It's a really big day.

42:24.377 --> 42:27.183
I just hope it's everything I've been imagining it to be.

42:32.772 --> 42:34.627
I just hope you actually get there.

42:43.985 --> 42:47.863
You know, if Sofia could just die during a fox trot, that would be perfect.

42:48.625 --> 42:49.317
Biscotti?

42:50.489 --> 42:51.246
Yes, please.

42:52.905 --> 42:53.843
They're all broken.

42:54.588 --> 42:56.649
I know. I like 'em that way.
