00:02.133 --> 00:04.200
Previously
on Witches of East End...

00:04.233 --> 00:06.466
(distorted):
I saw you kill your brother, and
I'm gonna need $50,000 in cash.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.566
It's his spirit animal.

00:07.600 --> 00:08.666
It created a barrier

00:08.700 --> 00:10.200
of protection around him.

00:10.233 --> 00:11.866
We can't penetrate it.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.066
Not with the cards anyway.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.566
He betrayed us once, Joanna.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.166
We can never trust him.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.566
Sorry.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.666
(chanting in ancient language)

00:21.700 --> 00:23.966
(gagging)

00:24.000 --> 00:26.233
Dash, wait!

00:26.266 --> 00:28.133
I don't really care, Freya.
Okay, I get it.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.133
Stay...

00:29.166 --> 00:31.366
the hell away from me.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.333
I need to show you something.
(gasps)

00:36.366 --> 00:38.700
This is giving me all kinds
of good ideas.

00:38.733 --> 00:39.966
That thing's infecting you.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.733
No wonder your husband left you.

00:41.766 --> 00:42.900
He knows where we are.

00:42.933 --> 00:44.500
He chooses to stay away.

00:44.533 --> 00:47.466
Or is it losing the girls over

00:47.500 --> 00:48.800
and over

00:48.833 --> 00:50.333
and over again?

01:08.233 --> 01:09.700
WENDY:
The portal's about to open.

01:09.733 --> 01:11.000
Joanna and Frederick
are coming through.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.533
VICTOR:
Finally.

01:12.566 --> 01:13.800
Wait, we don't know
for sure that it's them.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.033
What if it's Grandfather?

01:15.066 --> 01:16.533
What if he's coming to kill us?

01:16.566 --> 01:17.866
He said he'd make us pay
for our rebellion.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.233
He already banished us
from Asgard.

01:20.266 --> 01:21.800
He's not gonna come here
just to kill us.

01:21.833 --> 01:22.833
We don't know that.

01:22.866 --> 01:24.200
He vowed revenge.

01:30.033 --> 01:31.133
(gasps)

01:31.166 --> 01:32.233
Joanna!

01:32.266 --> 01:33.400
I knew you'd make it through.

01:33.433 --> 01:34.966
Where's Frederick?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.900
I lost him!

02:02.433 --> 02:05.333
Why did you text me to meet you
outside in the garden?

02:05.366 --> 02:07.066
This morning I was
watching Frederick sleep.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.200
Okay, that's not creepy.

02:09.233 --> 02:11.500
He has the king's symbol
branded on his chest.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.733
I knew it. I told you.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.900
Not so fast. We still
don't know what it means.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.166
Branding the king's symbol
onto your chest

02:17.200 --> 02:19.000
is the ultimate oath
of loyalty, Joanna.

02:19.033 --> 02:20.500
It means that he's
spiritually bound

02:20.533 --> 02:22.700
to our father for eternity.

02:22.733 --> 02:23.733
I mean we don't know
the circumstances

02:23.766 --> 02:24.733
under which he took the oath.

02:24.766 --> 02:25.866
Well, did you ask him?

02:25.900 --> 02:27.000
No! I don't want him

02:27.033 --> 02:28.500
to know that I saw it.

02:28.533 --> 02:29.666
I guess you don't
trust him, either.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.366
I wouldn't go that far.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.566
But it‐it raises questions.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.066
No, it answers them‐‐ that's
why he spelled my earring.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.733
I'm sorry, what are
we talking about now?

02:37.766 --> 02:41.633
I lost an earring, and he found
it on the porch yesterday.

02:41.666 --> 02:42.666
And?
And I think

02:42.700 --> 02:43.900
he did something to it.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.900
You think or you know?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.566
(sighs)

02:47.600 --> 02:49.033
He knows that I don't trust him,

02:49.066 --> 02:50.666
and so he took something
that belongs to me,

02:50.700 --> 02:52.333
and he messed with it.
Okay, so give it to me.

02:52.366 --> 02:53.833
Maybe I can figure it out.

02:53.866 --> 02:55.800
I'll do an unveiling spell.
I got rid of it.

02:55.833 --> 02:57.666
I didn't want it
anywhere near me.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.566
So, the truth is he just
could've found your earring.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.466
Joanna, you asked me to come
out here to talk about this

03:02.500 --> 03:04.166
because you have doubts.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.566
I do.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.200
I feel horrible
and guilty for it.

03:09.233 --> 03:10.733
So, yes, you're right.

03:10.766 --> 03:12.500
There've been two people
who've been killed

03:12.533 --> 03:15.200
in the town and we must make
sure that it wasn't Frederick.

03:15.233 --> 03:17.966
But we need to be
smart about it.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.966
We can't let him know
that we're suspicious.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.300
No, you're right.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.966
But I have an idea of how

03:24.000 --> 03:26.700
we can get information
without asking him.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.500
I can't believe when I get back
you're gonna be gone.

03:37.533 --> 03:38.866
I know.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.066
I've lived in this
room my entire life.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.566
It's so strange.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.733
I thought I'd be sadder,

03:44.766 --> 03:46.466
but I feel good.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.666
I feel ready.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.066
Well, I'm happy for you.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.400
Although I am a little bummed.

03:50.433 --> 03:51.733
I always assumed
I'd be the first person

03:51.766 --> 03:53.966
to move out of here.
You still can, you know.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.233
(laughs)
I could.

03:55.266 --> 03:57.333
Except I just spent
my entire life savings

03:57.366 --> 03:59.900
on a last‐minute flight
to Santo Domingo.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.300
(chuckles)

04:01.333 --> 04:02.700
What time do you leave?

04:02.733 --> 04:05.533
Cab's picking me up
in ten minutes.

04:05.566 --> 04:07.366
Are you sure you
want to do this?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.466
I don't have a choice.
I had a vision

04:09.500 --> 04:11.466
of Killian's death.
That's why I need to find him.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.933
I love you.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.666
Freya, you have no idea

04:16.700 --> 04:17.800
what you're getting into.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.166
I just want you to be safe.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.900
Like I'm safe here.

04:20.933 --> 04:22.200
We know Dash has powers.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.733
That scares the shit out of me.

04:23.766 --> 04:25.700
Which is why one of us
should talk to him.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.166
We are the only ones
who understand

04:27.200 --> 04:28.233
what he's going through.

04:28.266 --> 04:29.333
He's probably really scared

04:29.366 --> 04:30.800
and confused right now.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.466
And full of rage!

04:32.500 --> 04:33.866
I left him at the altar!

04:33.900 --> 04:35.666
Mom and Wendy killed his mother!

04:35.700 --> 04:36.866
He doesn't know that part.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.800
He knows he hates us.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.700
We should just leave him alone.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.300
It's not his fault.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.633
Penelope took his powers
from him when he was a baby.

04:44.666 --> 04:47.533
And now that she's dead,
they're rightfully his again.

04:47.566 --> 04:49.533
What Dash needs is guidance.

04:49.566 --> 04:51.400
Just think about the kind
of damage he could do

04:51.433 --> 04:53.366
if he knew what
he was capable of.
Aren't you worried

04:53.400 --> 04:55.866
that he could hurt
someone accidentally?

04:55.900 --> 04:58.166
You know that. It's like
he's holding a loaded gun.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.333
And he doesn't know
how to use it.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.700
(sighs)

05:00.733 --> 05:03.133
What is that?

05:03.166 --> 05:05.133
Is that a door?

05:05.166 --> 05:07.166
It's locked.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.533
It's not a door.

05:08.566 --> 05:09.800
Yes, it is.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.666
It used to be a door,

05:11.700 --> 05:14.133
and it connected
to the dining room,

05:14.166 --> 05:15.466
and I needed more closet space,

05:15.500 --> 05:17.300
so I sealed it
from the other side.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.500
It's locked.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.366
So, where are the keys?
(stammers)

05:22.433 --> 05:24.366
I'd have to find it.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.366
Why are you being weird?

05:26.400 --> 05:27.966
I'm not being weird.
She's hiding something.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.400
What else is new?

05:29.433 --> 05:31.066
I'm not hiding anything.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.033
Freya, your cab's here.
(horn honks in distance)

05:33.066 --> 05:35.500
Oh, God, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.933
One more thing.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
(speaking Latin)

05:50.033 --> 05:52.400
May you be protected
on your journey.

05:52.433 --> 05:53.633
And may you find

05:53.666 --> 05:56.033
the one you seek.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.066
Thanks, Mom.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.833
Okay.

06:03.866 --> 06:05.866
Okay.

06:31.033 --> 06:32.433
Miss me?

06:34.400 --> 06:35.733
You think having
one‐night stands

06:35.766 --> 06:37.000
will make your
problems go away?

06:37.033 --> 06:38.400
Leave me alone.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.900
How much has
this blackmailer
cost you so far?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.500
Why are you wasting your time

06:41.533 --> 06:42.800
when you should be
dealing with him?

06:42.833 --> 06:44.366
DASH:
I hired a guy

06:44.400 --> 06:45.833
to look into his I. P. address

06:45.866 --> 06:47.233
and his cell number.

06:47.266 --> 06:48.400
I got nothing.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.066
So, you're just gonna give up?

06:50.100 --> 06:52.200
Bro, I can't believe I
used to look up to you.

06:52.233 --> 06:54.700
What do you want from me?
Do you know what
your problem is?

06:54.733 --> 06:56.333
You spent your whole
life trying to be

06:56.366 --> 06:57.900
the good son or
the good doctor,

06:57.933 --> 07:00.700
the good boyfriend, but
when you got to be a badass,

07:00.733 --> 07:01.833
you don't know how.

07:01.866 --> 07:03.400
Shut up.
Am I wrong?

07:03.433 --> 07:04.533
Yeah. You're wrong.

07:04.566 --> 07:06.166
Then prove it.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.800
That guy's gonna ruin your life.

07:08.833 --> 07:12.733
Find him, and ruin his first.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.833
Dash?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.600
Who are you talking to?

07:30.566 --> 07:32.566
Ah.

07:34.166 --> 07:37.233
Dr. Foster?

07:37.266 --> 07:38.966
It's nice to meet you.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.966
Oh.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.066
Strong, silent type, huh?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.733
Let's see what we
can do about that.

07:47.866 --> 07:49.866
(chanting in ancient language)

07:54.900 --> 07:56.366
(inhales deeply)

07:57.766 --> 07:59.033
Hi, Dr. Foster.

07:59.066 --> 08:00.500
Sorry to disturb you.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.166
But I need your help.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.633
I need you to tell me who
attacked you in the park.

08:05.666 --> 08:08.033
(mumbling)

08:10.266 --> 08:12.033
What, honey?
You're gonna have to speak up.

08:13.766 --> 08:16.066
This is a warning to us all!
Dr. Foster, keep it down!

08:16.100 --> 08:18.733
His plan is only just beginning.
Whose plan?

08:18.766 --> 08:19.900
You're one of them!
I know what you are!

08:19.933 --> 08:21.166
Oh, shit!
I know what you are!

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
I know what you are!
(chanting)

08:22.233 --> 08:23.266
You're one of them. I know...

08:26.700 --> 08:28.166
(gasps)

08:44.582 --> 08:46.582
(phone dings)

08:55.549 --> 08:58.415
(door closes)

08:58.449 --> 09:00.215
What's going on?

09:00.249 --> 09:03.015
Nothing.

09:03.049 --> 09:04.715
You look upset.
No, I'm just...

09:04.749 --> 09:06.249
I'm worried about your father.

09:06.282 --> 09:07.515
I still haven't heard from him.

09:07.549 --> 09:08.915
So, where have you been?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.815
Running.
This place is so flat,

09:10.849 --> 09:12.315
it's almost too easy.

09:12.349 --> 09:14.415
But I love the air here.
Everything smells like food.

09:14.449 --> 09:16.915
Except me,
so I'm gonna go shower.

09:16.949 --> 09:18.749
So, your grandfather,
he's still in power

09:18.782 --> 09:20.915
in Asgard, right?

09:22.615 --> 09:25.382
Yeah, what's left of it anyway.

09:25.415 --> 09:26.549
What do you mean?

09:26.582 --> 09:28.149
Whole cities
are gone now.

09:28.182 --> 09:30.082
Leveled, burned to the ground

09:30.115 --> 09:31.915
at the first sign of dissent.

09:31.949 --> 09:33.915
Not that there's
much dissent anymore.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.349
He's built a cult
around himself.

09:35.382 --> 09:38.215
He's worshipped like a god.

09:38.249 --> 09:41.882
His power is unquestioned,
all‐encompassing.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.015
Well, you don't worship him.

09:49.082 --> 09:51.215
No.

09:51.249 --> 09:54.082
I mean, you did once.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.749
I wouldn't say worshipped.

09:55.782 --> 09:57.249
But he is my grandfather.

09:57.282 --> 09:59.415
He was the only family
I had left in Asgard.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.349
And I did love him.

10:02.382 --> 10:04.015
Before he became corrupt.

10:04.049 --> 10:05.415
But you remained loyal to him

10:05.449 --> 10:06.882
long after he became corrupt.

10:06.915 --> 10:07.882
You could've joined us

10:07.915 --> 10:10.815
in the rebellion.

10:10.849 --> 10:13.215
You didn't.

10:18.515 --> 10:20.215
Because he fed me lies
about all of you,

10:20.249 --> 10:21.582
and I believed him.

10:21.615 --> 10:23.982
I didn't know
what I was doing.

10:24.015 --> 10:25.649
By the time I realized how wrong
I'd been about everything,

10:25.682 --> 10:26.949
it was too late.

10:29.415 --> 10:31.315
I thought you understood.

10:31.349 --> 10:34.182
I do, I do.

10:34.215 --> 10:37.015
I‐I would like
to understand better.

10:37.049 --> 10:40.215
I'd like to know what it is
you've been through.

10:40.249 --> 10:41.515
I just want to forget,

10:41.549 --> 10:43.415
start over,
leave the past behind.

10:43.449 --> 10:46.049
I need to shower
'cause I'm meeting some people

10:46.082 --> 10:47.482
later at the Bent Elbow
for drinks.

10:47.515 --> 10:48.882
I know
this sounds strange,

10:48.915 --> 10:50.815
but for the first time
in a long time

10:50.849 --> 10:53.315
I feel comfortable,
like I'm at home.

10:53.349 --> 10:56.215
I love you, Frederick.

10:56.249 --> 10:58.282
Thanks.

11:08.415 --> 11:10.015
I have the portal key.
(gasping)

11:10.049 --> 11:11.849
How did you get that?
One of the king's
guards

11:11.882 --> 11:13.849
helped me steal it.
WENDY: We have
to use it now.

11:13.882 --> 11:17.082
We're not sealing the portal
until Frederick comes through.

11:17.115 --> 11:19.649
We may already be too late.
You stole the key.

11:19.682 --> 11:22.149
He's gonna come after it.
Joanna, if we use the key
to seal the portal now,

11:22.182 --> 11:23.882
the king won't be able
to come through.

11:23.915 --> 11:25.315
Every second we wait,
it's another chance

11:25.349 --> 11:26.382
for him to kill us.

11:26.415 --> 11:28.715
Frederick
is a warrior.

11:28.749 --> 11:31.715
He will survive.

11:31.749 --> 11:35.482
Joanna, seal the portal.
Do it now.
I cannot believe

11:35.515 --> 11:38.082
you're saying this.
He's our son.
No one wants to leave Frederick

11:38.115 --> 11:39.915
behind. None of us want
to leave Frederick,
These are our daughters!

11:39.949 --> 11:42.849
Joanna, but we're running out
of time.

11:48.615 --> 11:50.815
Frederick.
I knew you'd come back! Yes.

11:50.849 --> 11:52.382
What happened?

11:52.415 --> 11:54.315
I had to fight my way out.
I killed three guards

11:54.349 --> 11:57.415
and managed to knock
Grandfather unconscious.
You fought him and you won.

11:57.449 --> 11:58.682
He'll be after us all soon
enough. Give me the key.

11:58.715 --> 11:59.682
I'll seal the portal.

11:59.715 --> 12:03.415
I thought
I'd lost you.

12:03.449 --> 12:06.915
WENDY:
Quick, lock the portal.

12:06.949 --> 12:08.415
Frederick?!

12:08.449 --> 12:10.082
No!
What have you done?

12:10.115 --> 12:11.249
VICTOR:
He'll find us now.

12:11.282 --> 12:13.115
How dare you betray
us this way?

12:29.615 --> 12:31.849
KILLIAN:
There he is.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.582
That's your guy.

12:33.615 --> 12:36.915
That boat is located in
exactly the right position

12:36.949 --> 12:40.015
for him to have taken those
pictures of you killing me.

12:40.049 --> 12:42.215
That's your blackmailer
right there.

12:42.249 --> 12:43.882
Kyle Hutton.

12:45.182 --> 12:48.649
He looks like a smug
little prick, too.

12:48.682 --> 12:50.682
So what are you
gonna do about it?

12:51.682 --> 12:53.982
You have powers now.

12:54.015 --> 12:56.049
Use 'em.

12:56.082 --> 12:58.349
Get rid of this guy.

12:59.349 --> 13:02.349
Just like you got rid of me.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.249
Finally some good news.

13:13.282 --> 13:15.849
What?
I just spoke with Victor.
He's at the airport,

13:15.882 --> 13:18.749
he's catching a plane
and he's on his way home.

13:18.782 --> 13:21.582
He's thrilled about Frederick.

13:21.615 --> 13:25.315
Joanna, thrilled
about what?

13:25.349 --> 13:26.582
I don't think there's
any question who's responsible

13:26.615 --> 13:27.849
for those deaths.

13:27.882 --> 13:29.682
I still have questions.

13:29.715 --> 13:31.349
But I think
we should

13:31.382 --> 13:33.749
look into...
what he's been doing

13:33.782 --> 13:35.349
when he's not home.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.649
Way ahead of you, sis.

13:38.682 --> 13:41.149
What's that?
It's a little something

13:41.182 --> 13:43.682
I used to sell in my shop
in New Orleans.

13:43.715 --> 13:45.749
I rubbed a little
on the back of his shirt.

13:45.782 --> 13:48.082
It's gonna show us where
he's going, where he's been.

13:48.115 --> 13:51.182
It's rudimentary,
not long‐lasting, but...

13:51.215 --> 13:53.749
it works.
He told me he went
to the Bent Elbow

13:53.782 --> 13:55.382
to meet
with some new friends.

13:55.415 --> 13:58.049
Well, let's see
if he was telling the truth.

13:58.082 --> 14:00.449
(speaking Latin)

14:16.549 --> 14:18.615
Where'd he go?

14:24.349 --> 14:26.015
It's working. It's showing
us where he's been.

14:30.349 --> 14:32.749
Yeah, that can't
be good.

14:54.849 --> 14:57.415
Hi.
Hi. Sorry.

14:57.449 --> 14:59.349
I think I have the wrong room.
KILLIAN:
Eva, who is it?

15:03.415 --> 15:05.482
What are you doing here?
Uh,

15:05.515 --> 15:07.349
I was just...
coming to find you.

15:10.782 --> 15:12.849
Hi. I'm Eva.

15:12.882 --> 15:15.182
Hi.
You gonna...

15:15.215 --> 15:17.015
introduce me?
Yeah, this is Freya.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.649
Freya, this
is Eva.

15:18.682 --> 15:20.082
My wife.

15:28.849 --> 15:32.749
FREYA:
So what happened to you
after you left East End?

15:32.782 --> 15:35.882
I'm not sure exactly.
I remember being on the dock,

15:35.915 --> 15:39.649
getting ready to leave,
but, uh, after that...

15:39.682 --> 15:42.482
it just gets foggy.

15:42.515 --> 15:44.849
All I can guess is I took off
and my boat ended up

15:44.882 --> 15:47.015
in some kind of squall.
I must've lost consciousness

15:47.049 --> 15:48.415
'cause the next thing I know

15:48.449 --> 15:50.015
I'm washed up
on the beach half‐dead.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.682
Eva found me.

15:51.715 --> 15:53.682
Nursed me back to health.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.649
She didn't leave
my side for a week.

15:55.682 --> 15:58.215
It's not exactly
a chore.

16:00.515 --> 16:02.549
It's so lucky
that she found you.

16:02.582 --> 16:05.249
What I don't understand
is how did

16:05.282 --> 16:09.082
you find me?
I called you a
few times and...

16:09.115 --> 16:12.082
when I didn't hear back,
I was worried, so...

16:12.115 --> 16:15.415
I hired a private detective.

16:15.449 --> 16:17.249
You did?
Yeah.

16:17.282 --> 16:19.682
Wow. You must
really care about him.

16:19.715 --> 16:21.782
Well, I am her brother‐in‐law.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.349
Actually, um,

16:25.382 --> 16:26.749
Dash and I didn't go through
with it.

16:26.782 --> 16:28.915
We broke up.

16:28.949 --> 16:31.849
It's complicated.

16:33.849 --> 16:36.882
Oh.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.182
(shuddering exhale)

16:44.449 --> 16:46.082
I'm really sorry.

16:47.782 --> 16:49.749
That's...

16:49.782 --> 16:52.182
not actually why I'm here.

16:52.215 --> 16:56.815
I have some bad news,
unfortunately.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.515
Killian, your mother
passed away.

17:00.549 --> 17:02.949
Oh, my God.

17:05.015 --> 17:07.982
What happened?
There's a lot
of details

17:08.015 --> 17:09.482
I don't know, but...

17:09.515 --> 17:12.582
I thought maybe
you would want to... come back

17:12.615 --> 17:16.149
and be with your brother and‐and
deal with all this at home.

17:16.182 --> 17:19.315
I can have us packed in an hour.
I'll call the airlines

17:19.349 --> 17:22.115
and get the
first flight out.

17:35.382 --> 17:38.215
I'm so sorry,
Killian.

17:38.249 --> 17:40.949
About everything.

17:44.615 --> 17:47.582
JOANNA:
Do you remember, when Frederick
was a little boy,

17:47.615 --> 17:49.815
he was scared of thunder?
(laughs)
(Wendy laughs)

17:49.849 --> 17:52.582
Every time there was a storm,
I'd build this little fort

17:52.615 --> 17:56.015
out of blankets and I'd hide
in there with him,

17:56.049 --> 17:58.015
singing songs
until it passed.

17:58.049 --> 18:00.249
Yeah, I remember.

18:00.282 --> 18:03.249
I think the trail's gone cold.
I don't see him.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.682
All right, let's hit
the refresh button.

18:06.715 --> 18:09.115
(speaking Latin)

18:10.782 --> 18:12.315
There he is.

18:12.349 --> 18:14.315
This is serious,
Joanna.

18:14.349 --> 18:16.849
He's heading to where
the others were attacked.

18:20.549 --> 18:23.515
Frederick.
Sorry, Freya.

18:23.549 --> 18:25.482
It wasn't my choice.

18:25.515 --> 18:28.582
We trusted you.

18:28.615 --> 18:31.149
You broke my heart.

18:31.182 --> 18:33.715
(panting)

18:35.349 --> 18:38.249
We need to go now.
While there's still time.

18:38.282 --> 18:40.049
The king will be through
that door any second.

18:40.082 --> 18:42.049
Joanna, leave him.
He sided
with your father.

18:42.082 --> 18:44.315
There's no
saving him.
Look at me.

18:44.349 --> 18:46.215
Frederick, look at me.

18:46.249 --> 18:49.049
Your grandfather
is lying

18:49.082 --> 18:51.982
because that snake key
has poisoned his mind.

18:52.015 --> 18:54.749
The only thing of
interest to him now

18:54.782 --> 18:56.749
is power. You can't save him.

18:56.782 --> 18:59.082
It's too late.

18:59.115 --> 19:01.515
Joanna, we need to go
and we need to go now!

19:01.549 --> 19:02.815
He's using you

19:02.849 --> 19:05.015
to get
at us.

19:05.049 --> 19:06.415
Your favor won't last.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.749
This isn't
who you are.

19:08.782 --> 19:10.482
I know
it isn't.

19:10.515 --> 19:11.749
None of us

19:11.782 --> 19:13.682
can go back.
This is our home now.

19:13.715 --> 19:16.849
Come with us. Please.

19:16.882 --> 19:19.682
You can't hide from him.

19:19.715 --> 19:21.849
He'll find you.

19:21.882 --> 19:23.882
All of you.

20:08.449 --> 20:11.049
(grunting)

20:14.549 --> 20:16.249
(shouts)

20:16.282 --> 20:17.715
(car alarm wailing)

20:27.382 --> 20:29.782
(panting)

20:32.282 --> 20:33.915
Hello?

20:33.949 --> 20:36.415
Kyle Hutton,
this is Dash Gardiner.

20:36.449 --> 20:38.849
I left something for you
in your car.

20:38.882 --> 20:41.249
If you ever contact me again,

20:41.282 --> 20:43.682
I'll do worse.

20:56.282 --> 20:57.815
(distant chanting)
(gasps)

20:57.849 --> 20:59.815
Do you hear that?

20:59.849 --> 21:02.915
JOANNA:
Wait, that's him.
That's actually him.

21:04.782 --> 21:06.382
(whispers):
What's he doing?

21:06.415 --> 21:08.182
Sounds like Old Norse.

21:13.449 --> 21:15.249
(chanting)

21:37.449 --> 21:38.715
He's gone.

21:44.415 --> 21:45.982
Well, how did he
disappear so fast?

21:46.015 --> 21:47.715
Looks like he's learning
some new tricks.

22:02.749 --> 22:04.515
Where's Killian?

22:04.549 --> 22:08.282
I left him upstairs
to finish packing.

22:09.949 --> 22:12.315
I wanted to talk
to you in private.

22:12.349 --> 22:15.049
I just wanted
to thank you for

22:15.082 --> 22:17.982
coming all the way here

22:18.015 --> 22:21.015
just to deliver
that news in person.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.549
Mm.

22:25.249 --> 22:26.915
He's very lucky

22:26.949 --> 22:28.215
to have a friend
like you,

22:28.249 --> 22:30.582
and I just hope

22:30.615 --> 22:34.182
that... you're not upset

22:34.215 --> 22:36.982
that you came here
and found him married to me.
No.

22:37.015 --> 22:39.215
Upset? No.

22:39.249 --> 22:41.382
Of course not. Why would I...

22:41.415 --> 22:42.815
Why would I be upset?

22:42.849 --> 22:44.749
I just sense
that...

22:44.782 --> 22:48.315
the two of you have...

22:48.349 --> 22:49.582
a history.

22:49.615 --> 22:51.849
Oh, no. No, no, no, n...

22:51.882 --> 22:55.149
No, i‐it's complicated, but,
um, Killian and I were never

22:55.182 --> 22:57.249
really anything.

22:57.282 --> 22:58.815
It's fine.

22:58.849 --> 23:01.315
I'm fine. It's...

23:01.349 --> 23:04.015
totally fine.
Everything's fine.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.049
Okay.

23:06.082 --> 23:08.182
I hope we can be friends.

23:08.215 --> 23:10.715
Killian really does
think the world of you.

23:13.049 --> 23:15.282
And so do I.

23:19.682 --> 23:21.515
Oh.

23:22.915 --> 23:24.582
INGRID:
Thank you so much for agreeing

23:24.615 --> 23:26.582
to see me. I really
hope I'm not intruding.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.515
It's just, the last
time we were together,

23:28.549 --> 23:30.015
we were interrupted.

23:30.049 --> 23:32.682
Right. The attack
on your boss.

23:32.715 --> 23:35.515
He died at the hospital
yesterday.

23:35.549 --> 23:38.215
I know. Everyone in town knows.

23:38.249 --> 23:41.815
People are saying
it's a serial killer.

23:41.849 --> 23:44.915
Yeah, it's, uh, it's awful.

23:44.949 --> 23:48.215
I have a theory
about the attacks.

23:48.249 --> 23:50.215
Look, Ingrid,
it's getting late...

23:50.249 --> 23:52.015
I think they're
being carried out

23:52.049 --> 23:54.649
by someone like us.

23:54.682 --> 23:57.649
What do you mean,
"someone like us"?

23:57.682 --> 24:01.215
Remember when you
asked me about the MRI?

24:01.249 --> 24:03.315
Yeah.

24:03.349 --> 24:06.715
Well, I‐I didn't exactly
tell you the truth.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.715
(phone dings)

24:08.749 --> 24:10.382
Sorry, one second.

24:12.782 --> 24:15.182
Is everything okay?

24:15.215 --> 24:17.315
Uh, yeah.

24:17.349 --> 24:19.415
Can you just wait here
for a minute?

24:19.449 --> 24:21.449
I'll be right back.

24:32.282 --> 24:33.749
You owe me, Gardiner.

24:33.782 --> 24:36.349
I really loved
that ride you torched.

24:36.382 --> 24:38.482
I'm calling the cops.
Do that,

24:38.515 --> 24:40.815
and those JPEGs go viral.
You don't scare me.

24:40.849 --> 24:42.849
Okay, I know
who you are...

24:42.882 --> 24:44.249
Your father's
William Hutton.

24:44.282 --> 24:45.849
He donated a wing
to the hospital.

24:45.882 --> 24:47.349
Your family has
plenty of money.

24:47.382 --> 24:48.882
My father has plenty of money.

24:48.915 --> 24:50.849
I have to make my own way.

24:50.882 --> 24:53.382
So this is your idea
of making your own way?
You owe me $100,000.

24:53.415 --> 24:55.515
That's not including the car.
You pay me by Friday,

24:55.549 --> 24:57.082
or everyone in East End
will know

24:57.115 --> 24:59.049
what you did to your brother.

25:02.749 --> 25:05.249
And what if I decide
to do the same to you?

25:05.949 --> 25:08.015
You won't.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.182
Dash?

25:10.215 --> 25:11.415
(gasps)

25:16.015 --> 25:17.149
(grunts)

25:17.182 --> 25:18.215
Dash.

25:19.515 --> 25:22.015
(grunting)

25:22.049 --> 25:24.149
INGRID:
Stop! Stop!

25:24.182 --> 25:25.549
Dash, stop.

25:27.215 --> 25:29.282
Dash, stop!

25:39.849 --> 25:42.049
Oh, my God.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.549
He's dead.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.061
I don't know what happened.
I couldn't stop.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.794
Dash, who is this?
Why is he here?

26:04.827 --> 26:06.561
I don't know.
He broke into my house,

26:06.594 --> 26:11.127
I thought he was
gonna shoot you.
I know.

26:11.161 --> 26:12.361
I lost it, I...

26:12.394 --> 26:13.961
I lost it. I...

26:13.994 --> 26:16.561
I killed him.

26:16.594 --> 26:18.427
Dash...

26:18.461 --> 26:20.461
You were trying to protect me.

26:20.494 --> 26:22.461
But you went too far
because you don't know

26:22.494 --> 26:24.461
how to control your powers.

26:24.494 --> 26:26.361
Powers‐‐
what are you talking about?
I am

26:26.394 --> 26:27.927
talking about the
bolts of electricity

26:27.961 --> 26:29.794
that were just coming
out of your fists.

26:29.827 --> 26:32.294
No, no.
I‐I just saw it.
I was here.

26:32.327 --> 26:34.627
No, you didn't.
No, you're full of it.

26:34.661 --> 26:37.561
You said you had a patient
whose MRI matched mine.

26:37.594 --> 26:39.961
I know that
patient was you.

26:39.994 --> 26:42.261
No, you don't.

26:42.294 --> 26:46.194
You're not a
regular person, Dash.

26:46.227 --> 26:48.094
And neither am I.

26:52.461 --> 26:55.261
We're witches.

26:56.461 --> 26:58.761
I...

26:58.794 --> 27:00.261
I'm‐I'm a witch?

27:00.294 --> 27:02.261
Technically, a warlock.

27:03.994 --> 27:06.227
I'm a warlock.

27:06.261 --> 27:08.894
I'm a warlock.
Well, that just...

27:08.927 --> 27:10.527
that sounds crazy,.

27:10.561 --> 27:12.027
We can call it something else

27:12.061 --> 27:14.361
if you want. It still
means the same thing.

27:14.394 --> 27:16.361
Think about it. How else
are you gonna explain

27:16.394 --> 27:18.594
all this that's
happening to you?
I don't know,

27:18.627 --> 27:21.061
I just thought
I was losing my mind.
You're not.

27:21.094 --> 27:24.027
You're just figuring out
who you really are.

27:24.061 --> 27:25.861
You were born this way.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.561
But your powers‐‐ they were only
just switched on very recently.

27:28.594 --> 27:30.627
They were dormant
before that.

27:30.661 --> 27:33.061
I can teach you
to control this

27:33.094 --> 27:35.627
if you'll let me.

27:37.794 --> 27:39.094
Yeah.

27:39.127 --> 27:43.061
Okay. Okay.

27:43.094 --> 27:45.527
What are we gonna do about this?

27:45.561 --> 27:49.127
I don't know.

28:02.294 --> 28:04.527
Frederick.

28:04.561 --> 28:06.561
We need to talk.

28:07.827 --> 28:09.794
Why are you
looking at me like that?

28:09.827 --> 28:12.261
We saw you in the forest.

28:12.294 --> 28:14.861
That was you?
You followed me?
How many people have you

28:14.894 --> 28:16.761
killed since you've
come through the portal?

28:16.794 --> 28:18.561
None. Nobody.
What are you talking about?

28:18.594 --> 28:20.894
You've carved the king's symbol
into their chests.

28:20.927 --> 28:22.594
No, I didn't.
I‐I didn't kill anybody.

28:22.627 --> 28:24.927
Your mother saw
your brand, Frederick.

28:24.961 --> 28:26.561
We know you took the oath.
So you think that

28:26.594 --> 28:28.227
means I killed those people?
Yes.

28:28.261 --> 28:30.394
We didn't forget
what you did at the portal.

28:30.427 --> 28:31.961
You're the reason we're cursed.

28:31.994 --> 28:33.927
Mom, you have to believe me.

28:33.961 --> 28:36.227
I would never hurt
anyone. I healed you.
Stop lying.

28:36.261 --> 28:38.527
I'm not lying.
All right, stop it,
both of you.

28:38.561 --> 28:40.861
What were you doing
in the woods?
A blood spell.

28:40.894 --> 28:43.194
A cleansing spell.
To hide
the king's brand.

28:43.227 --> 28:45.694
I was getting rid of it.
'Cause it proves
that you're still

28:45.727 --> 28:47.427
in league with your grandfather.
No, no, I hate him.

28:47.461 --> 28:49.794
Okay? He forced me to take that
oath with a knife to my throat

28:49.827 --> 28:51.761
and as soon as I was done,
he threw me in jail.

28:51.794 --> 28:54.294
I didn't see the sun for 100
years, he reveled in my pain,

28:54.327 --> 28:56.361
and every time I look in
the mirror I have to see

28:56.394 --> 28:57.561
his symbol, and it kills me.

28:58.761 --> 29:00.361
Look...

29:00.394 --> 29:02.394
all I want to do
is forget. Look.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.261
It's still there.

29:06.294 --> 29:08.061
I knew you saw it
this morning.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.861
I saw your face
when you walked away

29:09.894 --> 29:11.194
and I felt so
awful, all I wanted

29:11.227 --> 29:13.127
to do was erase it,
but there is...

29:13.161 --> 29:15.761
there is no spell that
will ever get rid of it.

29:15.794 --> 29:17.761
Grandfather made
sure of that.
All right, Frederick.

29:17.794 --> 29:20.861
Frederick, I'm so sorry.

29:20.894 --> 29:23.027
Look, I just want
to move on.
Oh, come on,

29:23.061 --> 29:25.727
you can't be s...
You can't be buying this.
Wendy, stop it.

29:25.761 --> 29:28.027
No, I can't.
You carved

29:28.061 --> 29:29.894
the symbol of the king
into your victims' chests.

29:29.927 --> 29:31.294
Explain that away.

29:31.327 --> 29:33.894
Grandfather has armies
of hunters

29:33.927 --> 29:35.294
that are loyal to him
to the death.

29:35.327 --> 29:37.061
Of course he'd
send one after me.

29:38.727 --> 29:40.561
And now you're all in danger
and it's my fault.

29:40.594 --> 29:44.027
It's okay, we'll
handle this together.

29:44.061 --> 29:46.294
Joanna.
Wendy...

29:46.327 --> 29:49.161
(sighs)
Just go, please.

29:52.761 --> 29:54.761
(scoffs, laughs)

29:57.661 --> 30:00.461
I don't blame her for
not believing me.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.727
Well...

30:02.761 --> 30:05.561
I do believe you, Frederick.

30:05.594 --> 30:07.794
I don't know why.

30:07.827 --> 30:09.927
I don't know how I can
ever have your trust

30:09.961 --> 30:11.527
ever again. What I did

30:11.561 --> 30:13.894
all those years ago‐‐
it was unforgivable

30:13.927 --> 30:15.894
and it still haunts me.

30:15.927 --> 30:17.861
All right, there's something
that I need to tell you

30:17.894 --> 30:19.627
about that night.

30:19.661 --> 30:21.961
Come with us, please.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.861
You can't hide from him.

30:23.894 --> 30:25.394
He'll find you.

30:39.394 --> 30:40.961
Oh...

30:40.994 --> 30:44.027
how very, very nice

30:44.061 --> 30:47.227
to have the family
together again.

30:47.261 --> 30:49.361
What are you waiting for,
Father?

30:49.394 --> 30:51.927
Just kill us
and get it over with.

30:51.961 --> 30:54.227
Death is too...

30:54.261 --> 30:56.894
forgiving a punishment.

30:56.927 --> 30:58.894
I want to do

30:58.927 --> 31:00.861
something

31:00.894 --> 31:02.227
far worse.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.427
I really want
you all

31:04.461 --> 31:07.627
to live a long,

31:07.661 --> 31:09.561
long time

31:09.594 --> 31:11.594
in misery.

31:13.227 --> 31:15.594
In fear.

31:15.627 --> 31:19.561
In pain.

31:19.594 --> 31:22.294
I want you
to suffer

31:22.327 --> 31:25.161
as you have made me...

31:26.994 --> 31:28.894
suffer.

31:28.927 --> 31:31.127
For what you did.

31:31.161 --> 31:33.327
What you did to me.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.427
(shouting in
foreign language)

31:41.227 --> 31:43.094
What have you
done to us?

31:43.127 --> 31:47.294
Let us go. I can't bear
to stay one more moment

31:47.327 --> 31:50.894
in this wretched place.

31:51.927 --> 31:54.894
(screaming)

31:54.927 --> 31:57.961
Aah!

31:59.461 --> 32:00.861
Frederick.

32:00.894 --> 32:02.461
No! Don't go with him!

32:02.494 --> 32:04.127
Don't go with him!

32:04.161 --> 32:06.394
You don't know
what you're doing!

32:06.427 --> 32:08.294
Don't go with him!

32:12.294 --> 32:14.027
(speaking foreign language)

32:14.061 --> 32:17.094
Wendy!

32:17.127 --> 32:19.594
It was my fault, all of it.

32:19.627 --> 32:22.927
I just... I didn't have
the strength to save you,

32:22.961 --> 32:24.794
and I let go of your hand.

32:24.827 --> 32:27.261
No. No, Mom.

32:27.294 --> 32:30.361
Mom, it's not your fault.

32:30.394 --> 32:33.027
You didn't let go. I did.

32:33.061 --> 32:35.961
I wanted to go
back with him.

32:35.994 --> 32:38.361
Okay, I wanted to.

32:38.394 --> 32:40.127
It was my choice.

32:40.161 --> 32:42.794
Not a day goes by that I don't
regret that decision,

32:42.827 --> 32:46.394
but it was my decision to make.

32:51.261 --> 32:55.027
I'm so sorry for all the things
you've been through alone.

32:55.061 --> 32:57.427
I know.

32:58.627 --> 33:00.727
I know.

33:02.894 --> 33:04.394
I know.

33:05.594 --> 33:08.094
I love you, Mom.

33:08.127 --> 33:09.761
I love you.

33:09.794 --> 33:12.227
I love you, too.

33:14.727 --> 33:18.761
And your father will be home
soon, so...

33:18.794 --> 33:21.761
we'll be a family again.

33:26.461 --> 33:28.894
(soft grunt)

33:42.427 --> 33:44.794
(low growling)

33:52.561 --> 33:54.561
(low growling)

34:01.827 --> 34:03.094
(animal shrieking)

34:15.884 --> 34:17.884
(scraping)

34:27.384 --> 34:29.384
(wind whistling)

34:38.218 --> 34:39.584
(grunts)

34:39.618 --> 34:42.684
INGRID:
As long as the doll

34:42.718 --> 34:44.451
stays underwater,

34:44.484 --> 34:48.184
no one will ever find the body.

34:48.218 --> 34:50.018
You think this is
really gonna work?

34:50.051 --> 34:52.018
Yes, I do.

34:52.051 --> 34:55.018
It should.
Thank you.

34:55.051 --> 34:58.184
I know you didn't
have to help me.
Yes, I did.

34:58.218 --> 35:01.984
And... thank you...

35:02.018 --> 35:05.984
for telling me the truth.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.951
Hey.

35:21.984 --> 35:23.518
What are you doing here?

35:23.551 --> 35:26.318
Eva went to sleep,
but I couldn't.

35:26.351 --> 35:28.751
I need to see you.

35:28.784 --> 35:30.751
I want to thank you again

35:30.784 --> 35:32.451
for traveling so far
to find me.

35:32.484 --> 35:35.118
Of course.
I'm just glad you're okay.

35:35.151 --> 35:37.551
I don't know
if I'd say I'm okay.

35:38.784 --> 35:40.751
You know, Mom‐‐ it's so...

35:40.784 --> 35:42.418
I know. I'm...

35:42.451 --> 35:44.984
I'm so sorry.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.784
Anyway,

35:46.818 --> 35:50.984
not a lot people would have gone
to the trouble you did, so...

35:51.018 --> 35:52.351
thank you.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.784
You're welcome.

35:59.984 --> 36:02.618
And I...

36:05.551 --> 36:07.984
wanted to apologize...

36:08.018 --> 36:09.951
for what I did
before the wedding‐‐

36:09.984 --> 36:12.918
showing up at your door,
asking you to run away with me.

36:12.951 --> 36:14.751
It was just
a messed up thing to do,

36:14.784 --> 36:16.784
and I don't even know
why I did it.

36:16.818 --> 36:18.918
I just think maybe...

36:18.951 --> 36:21.418
it was never about you.

36:21.451 --> 36:24.951
I was so screwed up,
so lost,

36:24.984 --> 36:27.618
and I'm not now.

36:27.651 --> 36:30.784
Leaving East End
and meeting Eva

36:30.818 --> 36:34.351
was... the best thing
that ever happened to me.

36:34.384 --> 36:36.118
You know, she
understands me.

36:36.151 --> 36:38.451
We're connected in ways...

36:38.484 --> 36:40.684
I can't‐can't explain.

36:40.718 --> 36:45.251
Just finally feel like I'm with
the right person now, you know?

36:45.284 --> 36:48.618
Good. I'm... I'm glad.

36:48.651 --> 36:51.084
I... I really want you
to be happy.

36:51.118 --> 36:54.451
And I want the same
for you. Freya,

36:54.484 --> 36:56.751
I hope you didn't walk away
from Dash

36:56.784 --> 36:59.284
because of me
or any of those things I said.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.018
I'd hate to be responsible.

37:02.051 --> 37:04.118
No.

37:04.151 --> 37:06.584
No. I, um...

37:06.618 --> 37:08.684
I was lost, too.

37:08.718 --> 37:11.151
I think it took the reality
of my wedding day

37:11.184 --> 37:13.584
to make me realize that...

37:13.618 --> 37:16.618
Dash and I were
never meant to be.

37:23.818 --> 37:26.284
It had nothing to do with you.

37:37.318 --> 37:38.618
Okay.

37:38.651 --> 37:41.951
Oh, good.

37:41.984 --> 37:45.951
I should really
get going.

37:45.984 --> 37:48.751
All right.

37:48.784 --> 37:51.184
Good night.

38:13.118 --> 38:15.484
What are you doing
in here?

38:15.518 --> 38:17.684
This is where I
always used to come

38:17.718 --> 38:19.784
when I needed
to talk to you.

38:19.818 --> 38:21.918
I got your text.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.484
Yeah.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.918
(sniffles)

38:24.951 --> 38:26.451
I've had a shitty day.

38:26.484 --> 38:28.151
I'm sorry, Freya.

38:28.184 --> 38:33.618
I thought my wedding day would
be the worst day of my life,

38:33.651 --> 38:35.651
but I think
this topped it.

38:35.684 --> 38:38.951
I really thought
he was my soul mate.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.851
Maybe he is.
You never know.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.584
(laughing):
He's married.

38:43.618 --> 38:44.951
And he's happy.

38:44.984 --> 38:47.318
I saw his aura
when he looked at her.

38:47.351 --> 38:50.084
He's... he's in love with her.

38:50.118 --> 38:52.684
Oh, Freya.

38:52.718 --> 38:54.251
I'm sorry.

38:54.284 --> 38:56.751
I wanted to ask him
about his powers, but I...

38:56.784 --> 38:58.618
I couldn't...

38:58.651 --> 39:01.018
It's okay.

39:02.284 --> 39:04.651
Am I a bad person?
Of course not.

39:04.684 --> 39:06.951
Maybe this is all
some sort of‐‐

39:06.984 --> 39:11.184
I don't know‐‐ cosmic payback
for what I did to Dash?

39:11.218 --> 39:13.751
Freya, you had
to follow your heart.

39:13.784 --> 39:17.651
If you weren't in love with
Dash, you couldn't marry him.

39:17.684 --> 39:20.684
I'm not saying I wanted
to get married, but...

39:20.718 --> 39:24.951
I've been wrong
about so many things.

39:24.984 --> 39:27.651
I thought
Killian was my soul mate,

39:27.684 --> 39:30.451
and he's in love
with somebody else.

39:30.484 --> 39:32.851
Maybe I'm wrong
about Dash.

39:34.484 --> 39:37.118
He was always such
a great person.

39:37.151 --> 39:38.918
I think you're right.

39:38.951 --> 39:41.251
I think you should
talk to him.

39:41.284 --> 39:43.618
I think you should help
him with his powers

39:43.651 --> 39:46.751
before he hurts
someone, you know.

39:46.784 --> 39:49.784
Yeah.

39:49.818 --> 39:52.584
You know, I'll think about it.

39:52.618 --> 39:54.951
(crying)

40:08.151 --> 40:10.518
(note plays on piano)

40:10.551 --> 40:13.284
(piano plays slowly)

40:24.151 --> 40:25.618
Why don't you get out of here?

40:26.818 --> 40:29.318
That's a hell of a greeting

40:29.351 --> 40:31.784
for the brother
you haven't seen in a month.

40:38.318 --> 40:40.351
It's really you.

40:40.384 --> 40:43.451
Who else would it be?
