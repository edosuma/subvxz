46:20.477 --> 46:21.501

Because she was in love.

53:22.899 --> 53:24.833
it is a twist in
story suddenly.

53:25.435 --> 53:25.764
Lets begin.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.671
they are our old family friend.

53:29.506 --> 53:31.098
Me and Manjeet was
live together in childhood.

53:31.775 --> 53:35.472
All says when they becomes
young then marry them.

53:36.646 --> 53:39.615
I feels very nice to hear
that I am marry with Manjeet.

53:40.116 --> 53:42.983
when we play home I don't
let Roop to be Manjeet's wife.

53:43.787 --> 53:45.584
In the age of 8 years.

53:45.889 --> 53:47.686
Me and Manjeet was standing
together on this tractor.

53:48.191 --> 53:51.024
And think that we make
our home behind the farm.

53:51.895 --> 53:55.092
And then I becomes young
and takes Manjeet like a joke.

53:55.999 --> 53:58.832

parents are never comes bigger.

53:59.236 --> 53:59.998
They are serious.

54:00.537 --> 54:02.664

risk and problems.

54:15.585 --> 54:16.984

01:19:01.682 --> 01:19:01.943
Good Morning

01:19:06.754 --> 01:19:09.245
Are you guys going to beat me together?

01:19:11.158 --> 01:19:13.217
Mehra Sir please don't beat me

01:19:16.196 --> 01:19:17.663
I know I have done something like that

01:19:18.198 --> 01:19:18.926
I have gone away without telling!

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:22.792
while Company was already in loss

01:19:24.672 --> 01:19:26.936
I know that there are rumors
in market about me!

01:19:27.908 --> 01:19:29.603
that I couldn't take my father's place

01:19:30.277 --> 01:19:31.574
company is going to split,

01:19:31.879 --> 01:19:33.039
my girlfriend married to other man!

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:34.569
that's why he run away from the city

01:19:34.848 --> 01:19:35.280
etc.

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.982
false rumors

01:19:39.086 --> 01:19:40.280
by the way

01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:41.218
that all is truth!

01:19:45.225 --> 01:19:46.886
our share prices are at all time low

01:19:47.261 --> 01:19:48.751
all new plans turned out flop!

01:19:49.063 --> 01:19:50.530
besides 572 claims too

01:19:50.798 --> 01:19:53.096
in others word, we are in much trouble!

01:19:53.567 --> 01:19:56.058
we are doomed!

01:19:56.637 --> 01:19:58.127
no worse could happen than that!

01:19:59.873 --> 01:20:04.139
what a man really wants, he gets it!

01:20:05.913 --> 01:20:06.743
and this time I want it really!

01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:10.607
that I will face all problems myself

01:20:11.118 --> 01:20:12.813
that I want to complete
all incomplete plans

01:20:13.253 --> 01:20:15.813
to raise this company as
much as Dad can't think!

01:20:18.359 --> 01:20:19.849
I know you all love him much!

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:23.287
he is somewhere

01:20:24.631 --> 01:20:25.256
watching us

01:20:26.767 --> 01:20:27.927
so come let show him

01:20:28.235 --> 01:20:30.032
that Boss! don't' need to worry much

01:20:30.637 --> 01:20:31.797
this company can run without you

01:20:32.139 --> 01:20:33.800
and can run better than your expectation!

01:20:34.274 --> 01:20:34.968
so what you say?

01:20:35.776 --> 01:20:36.606
what do you say?

01:20:51.692 --> 01:20:55.219
Mrs. Khanna does not want to entertain,
any settlement of the stage!

01:20:56.663 --> 01:20:59.291
she is here only to honor the
request for this meeting

01:21:00.667 --> 01:21:05.297
she thinks that Mr. Aditya behaved to her
in very inappropriate manner

01:21:05.906 --> 01:21:07.237
so there's no further company negotiation

01:21:07.841 --> 01:21:09.900
you talk too much!

01:21:10.978 --> 01:21:13.640
you have fun talking in such way?

01:21:14.982 --> 01:21:16.882
eventually, I have seeing guys
like you for two three days

01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:17.774
excuse me

01:21:19.353 --> 01:21:20.251
that's your client's claim

01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:21.985
I'm ready to sign it.

01:21:23.257 --> 01:21:24.189
you job is finished

01:21:25.025 --> 01:21:26.617

take a chill pill

01:21:27.161 --> 01:21:30.688
hello, take care of Sir!

01:21:31.765 --> 01:21:32.732
and ask him, how
much is his mobile bill!

01:21:35.803 --> 01:21:37.202
Mrs. Khanna whatever you
do, in your personal life,

01:21:38.939 --> 01:21:40.668
with your husband and family,

01:21:42.075 --> 01:21:43.042
that's your personal matter!

01:21:45.112 --> 01:21:46.943
that's none of company's concern

01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.646
I can not snatch your whole life effort,
because of this,

01:21:54.755 --> 01:21:57.349
you and Mr. Kashaf started
this company in a room,

01:21:59.193 --> 01:22:02.060
because of your efforts, this
company is at this stage,

01:22:05.699 --> 01:22:09.260
these five things,
you can't ask to anyone,

01:22:10.704 --> 01:22:11.762
and no one can give it to you,

01:22:16.243 --> 01:22:18.006
this company is as much your as mine,

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:24.246
I want to give you the same place,
same responsibilities,

01:22:25.786 --> 01:22:27.048
as it was 5 years back,

01:22:28.889 --> 01:22:29.355
is that ok?

01:22:33.994 --> 01:22:35.427
you get the papers ready,
I want to sign in one hour, ok!

01:22:36.096 --> 01:22:36.721

01:22:38.866 --> 01:22:39.423

01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:52.178
you have to get itemized bills,
it's very important,

01:22:55.749 --> 01:22:56.443

01:23:00.754 --> 01:23:01.482
and what else am I afraid of?

01:23:02.256 --> 01:23:02.813
Steak owners,

01:23:03.223 --> 01:23:05.123
Arrange the meeting with Steak Owners,
tomorrow morning,

01:23:05.359 --> 01:23:08.123
when they come to know that Mom is back,
I want to see the expression on their faces,

01:23:08.462 --> 01:23:09.724
than I'll put my terms in front of them,

01:23:10.264 --> 01:23:10.855
Addy!

01:23:12.199 --> 01:23:12.756

01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:15.426
you went to Manali?

01:23:16.136 --> 01:23:18.070
there you went to some Church or etc?

01:23:19.039 --> 01:23:19.334
Correct, that's right

01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:20.771
no there is something you are hiding!

01:23:21.141 --> 01:23:21.436
the matter is serious,

01:23:22.075 --> 01:23:25.169
I'm afraid, you'll solve all your problem,
if you'll work like that?

01:23:26.213 --> 01:23:28.010
you are doing this much work,
that Bill haven't done in 6 months

01:23:29.783 --> 01:23:30.977
do you have any care of your reputation!

01:23:31.885 --> 01:23:32.817
what is wrong with you,

01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:36.516
what's wrong with me,
How can I forget?

01:23:37.457 --> 01:23:37.821
what?

01:23:38.258 --> 01:23:39.020
the most important thing,

01:23:39.326 --> 01:23:39.917
Annual Report,

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:40.758
no, no!

01:23:41.528 --> 01:23:41.960
I'll see you,

01:28:26.746 --> 01:28:28.771
India's first long distance calling cards,

01:28:35.121 --> 01:28:35.382
Excuse me Sir!

01:28:35.789 --> 01:28:37.347
how you come up with the
idea of calling card in India

01:28:38.091 --> 01:28:39.820
the world is getting shorter,
and India is getting bigger,

01:28:40.527 --> 01:28:41.619
today we talk to worldwide,

01:28:42.262 --> 01:28:44.389
Idea is that, people talk looking to heart,
not looking to bill,

01:28:46.132 --> 01:28:46.655
we'll call, it doesn't really matter,

01:28:47.167 --> 01:28:48.532
Matters is as our terms are meant

01:28:52.606 --> 01:28:53.402
what you thought you'll get rid of me?

01:28:54.641 --> 01:28:55.130

01:29:32.913 --> 01:29:34.847

01:29:35.882 --> 01:29:37.349
Geet has told us everything!

01:29:37.651 --> 01:29:40.449

01:29:42.822 --> 01:29:44.790
Roop saw you, make her run

01:29:45.759 --> 01:29:48.751
and you think that we are..

01:29:51.331 --> 01:29:53.799

01:31:07.507 --> 01:31:07.802

01:31:37.971 --> 01:31:38.733

01:31:53.319 --> 01:31:54.286

01:31:54.687 --> 01:31:55.619
or you can read my mind?

01:31:58.525 --> 01:31:58.991
I'm going to Manali,

01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:30.522

01:32:38.832 --> 01:32:39.298

01:32:43.803 --> 01:32:44.428
Aditya Kashaf

01:32:45.772 --> 01:32:47.069
Aditya Kashaf

01:32:49.542 --> 01:32:49.974
Aditya Kashaf!

01:32:51.878 --> 01:32:53.345
By the way I've heard a lot about you,

01:32:53.746 --> 01:32:54.610
from the same source of course,

01:32:55.048 --> 01:32:57.346
this a present for you,
and your family

01:32:57.984 --> 01:32:58.473
Please!

01:32:59.018 --> 01:32:59.643
Thank you!

01:33:03.823 --> 01:33:04.573
So!

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.887
Actually, Geet's family is
a quite worried,

01:33:11.631 --> 01:33:14.566
she said that after marriage,
you both will go to Bhatinda,

01:33:15.001 --> 01:33:17.561
but I guess, not such happened!

01:33:19.038 --> 01:33:19.663
who?

01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:22.364
what?

01:33:22.775 --> 01:33:24.402
who said that after marriage..

01:33:25.979 --> 01:33:26.445
Geet said!

01:33:27.447 --> 01:33:27.970
which Geet are you talking about?

01:33:33.419 --> 01:33:34.408
how many Geets you know?

01:33:35.922 --> 01:33:36.911
I don't know any Geet!

01:33:42.595 --> 01:33:43.845
Geet!

01:33:50.403 --> 01:33:51.597
take care!

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.003
you...

01:34:03.716 --> 01:34:04.410
how Anjuman!

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:07.987
how can you do this?

01:34:09.055 --> 01:34:09.953
please don't make me feel guilty!

01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:12.685
I didn't tell her to run from home!

01:34:13.459 --> 01:34:13.857
you get it?

01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:15.593
but still she came to meet you!

01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:18.864
leaving all the things behind,

01:34:19.699 --> 01:34:20.131
why?

01:34:20.667 --> 01:34:21.497
because she is mad!

01:34:22.135 --> 01:34:23.432
you know her!

01:34:23.836 --> 01:34:26.430
than you must know that,
how childish she is!

01:34:27.006 --> 01:34:27.995
she lives in a world of dreams

01:34:28.675 --> 01:34:30.666
she thinks that everything happens
as she want that to be!

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.941
and you proved her that she has
no world of dream

01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:38.414
because there lives guys like you!

01:34:39.686 --> 01:34:41.586
look! I know you are a billionaire!

01:34:42.488 --> 01:34:43.750
but this is my personal matter!

01:34:44.457 --> 01:34:45.822
and I don't have to give any
explanations to you!

01:34:47.126 --> 01:34:47.615
right!

01:34:49.462 --> 01:34:51.623
what you have done with her,
there's no explanation left!

01:34:52.832 --> 01:34:53.127
everything is clear!

01:34:55.134 --> 01:34:56.999
but it's not clear that
what are you doing here?

01:34:58.771 --> 01:35:00.466
she never said, that she knows you!

01:35:01.207 --> 01:35:02.697
but you came this far for her sake,

01:35:03.176 --> 01:35:04.666
what's the scene boss?

01:35:12.518 --> 01:35:14.850
I definitely would have told
you what's scene between us!

01:35:16.589 --> 01:35:18.784
but cheaper man like you
is not able to understand!

01:35:21.094 --> 01:35:21.492
Cheap!

01:35:23.029 --> 01:35:23.495
Cheap!

01:35:24.063 --> 01:35:24.529
loser!

01:35:25.598 --> 01:35:26.848
what?

01:35:28.568 --> 01:35:28.966
what's cheap about me?

01:35:30.703 --> 01:35:33.570
you talking like that,
I have promised her to marry?

01:35:34.607 --> 01:35:35.767
I never talked her about marriage!

01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.806
she was crazy about that

01:35:38.745 --> 01:35:40.474
we'll do this after marriage,
we'll do that!

01:35:40.913 --> 01:35:42.210
such home, such balcony

01:35:42.682 --> 01:35:43.046
such curtains,

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.648
I told her,

01:35:49.088 --> 01:35:49.884
Go back to Bhatinda,

01:35:50.757 --> 01:35:52.691
when she used to call from Simla,
I said the same!

01:35:53.559 --> 01:35:54.491
but, she don't listen to me!

01:35:55.762 --> 01:35:57.252
than take it that way!
don't matters to me at all!

01:35:57.997 --> 01:35:59.225
she isn't back to her
home for 9 months!

01:35:59.799 --> 01:36:00.493
9 months!

01:36:00.933 --> 01:36:01.661
she's all alone
somewhere for 9 months

01:36:02.168 --> 01:36:04.659
don't know, how is she?
how she had been these days!

01:36:05.772 --> 01:36:06.739
just because that you refused her!

01:36:09.909 --> 01:36:11.103
If this don't matter to you,

01:36:12.045 --> 01:36:12.807
than that's good happened to her!

01:36:13.813 --> 01:36:16.976
she must be punished, that she
loved a guy like you this much

01:36:20.086 --> 01:36:20.609
Anjuman!

01:41:21.921 --> 01:41:22.182

01:41:24.857 --> 01:41:25.221

01:41:31.163 --> 01:41:32.289

01:41:33.132 --> 01:41:33.564

01:42:19.512 --> 01:42:20.376
and I'll live in it!

Shall we go now?

01:42:57.583 --> 01:42:59.642

01:43:00.186 --> 01:43:01.483

01:43:02.054 --> 01:43:02.952

01:43:49.001 --> 01:43:49.660

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.197

01:46:14.446 --> 01:46:15.777
I'm stuck here in middle!

01:46:20.386 --> 01:46:21.546
All the time I use to think,

01:46:23.722 --> 01:46:24.484
what should I do?

01:46:26.258 --> 01:46:28.249
what should I say
him that he agree,

01:46:32.564 --> 01:46:33.622
I can't understand anything!

01:46:37.569 --> 01:46:39.196
don't know what I was thinking!

01:46:56.355 --> 01:46:57.447
I tell you what you should do!

01:46:58.223 --> 01:46:59.622
just throw out Anjuman from your life!

01:46:59.959 --> 01:47:00.357
do whatever you can,

01:47:02.361 --> 01:47:04.761
he's not coming back!

01:47:05.597 --> 01:47:07.861
he would have come
much early, If he wanted to!

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:09.890
he's not even thinking about you,

01:47:10.369 --> 01:47:11.393
he's happy with his life!

01:47:15.908 --> 01:47:16.806
you met him?

01:47:17.977 --> 01:47:18.409
yes!

01:47:18.877 --> 01:47:19.502

Anjuman chapter is closed!

01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:34.284

01:47:48.674 --> 01:47:50.972
take out his photograph and burn it up!

01:47:51.443 --> 01:47:52.307
give me his photograph!

01:47:53.245 --> 01:47:53.768
I don't have his photo.

01:47:57.383 --> 01:47:57.644
Ok!

01:47:58.417 --> 01:48:00.248
we'll call him and you have to
start abusing him

01:48:00.619 --> 01:48:02.553
the much abuses you know,
give him all!

01:48:05.257 --> 01:48:05.780
it's kind of childish act?

01:48:06.992 --> 01:48:07.651
great!

01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:09.625
do the childish act,
abuse him much as you can,

01:48:09.962 --> 01:48:10.860
spit all what you got inside

01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:12.388
and you'll feel fantastic!

01:48:18.804 --> 01:48:19.236
Aditya listen

01:48:23.876 --> 01:48:26.606
it's ringing, get ready,
spit all what you know...

01:48:27.046 --> 01:48:27.444
Please!

01:48:30.049 --> 01:48:31.516
Anjuman?
One second.

01:48:33.685 --> 01:48:36.313
Come on, just go for it.

01:48:44.496 --> 01:48:45.963
Geet?
- Yes.

01:48:47.299 --> 01:48:49.601
was that Aditya's voice?

01:48:49.601 --> 01:48:50.761
Yes

01:48:53.839 --> 01:48:56.308
Anjuman, I wanted say that...

01:48:56.308 --> 01:48:57.443
Say it Geet.

01:48:57.443 --> 01:48:59.673
Don't think, just say it.

01:49:00.846 --> 01:49:02.336
Dog!
- what?

01:49:04.650 --> 01:49:05.844
Dog, stupid!

01:49:06.552 --> 01:49:07.951
More, bigger curses.

01:49:09.088 --> 01:49:10.885
You bastard.

01:49:12.424 --> 01:49:13.721
Son of a pig!

01:49:14.693 --> 01:49:17.753
what did you think? If you leave
me I will long for you. Right?

01:49:17.753 --> 01:49:19.431
You will be restless, rascal.

01:49:19.431 --> 01:49:20.693
You'll be eaten by worms.

01:49:20.693 --> 01:49:22.700
You'll die like a dog.

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.329
And you'll burn in hell
forever after dying. You son of a...

01:49:33.445 --> 01:49:34.537
Feeling better?

01:49:35.781 --> 01:49:36.748
Yes.

01:49:36.748 --> 01:49:38.476
Yes.
Great.

01:50:35.607 --> 01:50:37.438
It's ok.

01:50:37.438 --> 01:50:39.136
It happens.

01:50:39.411 --> 01:50:40.742
It won't happen again.

01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.811
There's nothing to worry about.

01:50:43.682 --> 01:50:45.616
I'm hungry.
what's in food?

01:50:45.616 --> 01:50:47.151
I'll see.

01:51:02.034 --> 01:51:03.865
You'll give me tour
of Simla tomorrow. Right?

01:51:06.205 --> 01:51:09.441
Don't be embarrassed.

01:51:09.441 --> 01:51:10.032
Come on.

01:51:10.032 --> 01:51:12.878
Lets eat, we have a long
day tomorrow.

01:51:12.878 --> 01:51:14.402
Come

01:51:15.514 --> 01:51:17.414
what's this?
what did you order?

01:51:17.414 --> 01:51:18.676
Is it good to eat?

01:51:18.676 --> 01:51:21.878
You should've ordered some
cheese bar b.q.

01:51:21.878 --> 01:51:24.889
Some local dishes...

01:52:05.097 --> 01:52:06.496
Geet, give me your hand.

01:52:10.836 --> 01:52:13.703
You know, I had been having
nightmares for a few months

01:52:13.703 --> 01:52:16.642
that I'm running after a train
and I can't catch it.

01:52:16.642 --> 01:52:17.768
So have you caught it now?
- Yes.

01:52:17.768 --> 01:52:18.571
Come then.

01:52:28.887 --> 01:52:30.878
You like me much. Right?

01:52:32.224 --> 01:52:33.122
Very much.

01:52:34.893 --> 01:52:36.155
I live you very much.

01:52:37.963 --> 01:52:39.225
But that's my problem.

01:52:40.732 --> 01:52:43.792
I can feel whatever I like.
Correct?

01:52:47.539 --> 01:52:49.530
You don't have to worry
about that.

01:52:50.175 --> 01:52:50.869
Ok?

01:52:53.278 --> 01:52:54.540
Ok?

01:53:15.834 --> 01:53:18.564
we will leave for Bhatinda in a while.

01:53:20.305 --> 01:53:22.034
No.
- Yes.

01:53:23.675 --> 01:53:25.165
How I'm going to face them?

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:27.837
what's to face?
You are going home.

01:53:27.837 --> 01:53:28.607
Come on.

01:53:45.297 --> 01:53:46.855
Can I talk to you?

01:53:47.666 --> 01:53:48.758
what is it?

01:53:48.758 --> 01:53:49.391
Just two minutes.

01:53:55.173 --> 01:53:56.765
Now there's no use of talking.

01:53:56.765 --> 01:53:57.976
Please Geet.

01:53:57.976 --> 01:53:58.965
Lets go somewhere.

01:54:00.112 --> 01:54:01.340
I don't want to talk to you.

01:54:01.613 --> 01:54:03.808
I made a mistake.
Ok.

01:54:03.808 --> 01:54:06.248
I wan too coward to take
you home with me.

01:54:07.052 --> 01:54:09.111
I've been acting for nine months
that I'm too strong.

01:54:09.111 --> 01:54:11.883
I'm practical. I'm right
whatever I did.

01:54:11.883 --> 01:54:16.018
But the truth is I couldn't handle
when you came out of nowhere.

01:54:16.018 --> 01:54:17.322
I was scared.

01:54:17.322 --> 01:54:19.796
Of mommy papa, society, religion and all.

01:54:19.796 --> 01:54:22.629
But now, I don't care about anything.

01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:24.635
It's not so important for me.

01:54:26.671 --> 01:54:31.608
You left me alone and helpless.
And after nine months you're saying..

01:54:31.608 --> 01:54:33.109
that you made a mistake.

01:54:34.646 --> 01:54:35.772
How easy it's for you.

01:54:35.772 --> 01:54:38.042
No, it's difficult.

01:54:38.042 --> 01:54:40.710
And I'll ease this difficulty.

01:54:41.787 --> 01:54:42.988
You've had enough.

01:54:42.988 --> 01:54:44.717
Now all problems are mine.

01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:49.127
Lets go to Bhatinda.
we'll talk to mommy papa.

01:54:49.127 --> 01:54:50.389
I'll explain them.

01:54:50.662 --> 01:54:52.254
I'll fix everything.

01:54:52.254 --> 01:54:53.763
Everything will be fine.

01:55:03.942 --> 01:55:05.341
why he had to come now?

01:55:05.341 --> 01:55:06.877
It's was all going to be fine.

01:55:08.013 --> 01:55:09.139
It's too late now.

01:55:10.148 --> 01:55:12.844
Now nothing can be done.
It's too late for that.

01:55:16.688 --> 01:55:17.916
You know Geet.

01:55:19.224 --> 01:55:21.385
My mom and dad didn't
use to love each other.

01:55:23.695 --> 01:55:25.219
They were in love with
some other individuals.

01:55:28.133 --> 01:55:30.226
That's why I had always
been in pain.

01:55:32.304 --> 01:55:34.067
They were very nice
to each other at work.

01:55:35.707 --> 01:55:37.174
But at home...

01:55:39.711 --> 01:55:41.076
I always used to ask myself that

01:55:43.081 --> 01:55:44.446
why did they married each other.

01:55:49.387 --> 01:55:51.412
They should've listened
to their hearts.

01:55:54.226 --> 01:55:56.057
Then eventually everything
would have been all right.

01:56:01.466 --> 01:56:03.400
You should also listen to your heart.

01:56:05.237 --> 01:56:06.295
Then everything will get all right.

01:56:08.006 --> 01:56:08.802
Meaning?

01:56:12.377 --> 01:56:14.311
when many year will be passed..

01:56:14.311 --> 01:56:16.313
these 9 months,

01:56:17.315 --> 01:56:19.442
No one will remember them.

01:56:22.053 --> 01:56:23.281
Really Aditya

01:56:24.523 --> 01:56:26.150
I couldn't have ever thought

01:56:27.425 --> 01:56:29.450
that you would take his side.

01:56:33.965 --> 01:56:36.024
I'm taking your side too.

01:56:37.869 --> 01:56:39.894
You and Anjuman

01:56:40.472 --> 01:56:42.030
are at the same side.

01:56:44.776 --> 01:56:46.038
It's simple.

01:56:47.445 --> 01:56:51.779
Those who love each other,
should live with each other.

01:56:53.485 --> 01:56:54.816
Only then everyone
can stay happy.

01:56:57.289 --> 01:56:58.085
And what about you?

01:57:02.427 --> 01:57:05.225
Do your first affair after
marriage with me.

01:57:05.225 --> 01:57:06.787
I too will be happy by that.

01:57:11.369 --> 01:57:12.165
Done.
- Done.

01:57:20.812 --> 01:57:22.006
No Aditya.

01:57:24.316 --> 01:57:26.216
It doesn't seem right.

01:57:27.586 --> 01:57:28.416
I wish...

01:57:32.490 --> 01:57:34.014
I wish it wasn't right.

01:57:37.028 --> 01:57:37.824
But..

01:58:29.381 --> 01:58:30.405
Evening, when?
Today?

01:58:31.182 --> 01:58:32.513
Are you bringing her?

01:58:32.513 --> 01:58:34.552
Bringing Geet?

01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:36.444
At what time?

01:58:37.288 --> 01:58:38.084
In the evening?

01:58:39.057 --> 01:58:39.955
All right son.

01:58:40.291 --> 01:58:41.883
we'll wait.

01:58:43.161 --> 01:58:43.627
Ok

01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:13.122
what's going on here?

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.889
The girl is returning
home after 9 months.

01:59:39.317 --> 01:59:40.477
Daughter!

01:59:41.486 --> 01:59:42.214
Are you all right?

01:59:42.214 --> 01:59:43.652
Come

01:59:48.426 --> 01:59:50.121
I didn't believe you

01:59:50.121 --> 01:59:51.594
that you'll bring Geet here.

01:59:51.594 --> 01:59:55.599
But you've won our heart
by proving me wrong.

01:59:55.599 --> 01:59:57.191
Great job.

02:00:00.138 --> 02:00:03.039
Thank God my daughter is back home.

02:00:11.216 --> 02:00:13.150
So, brother-in-law!

02:00:14.986 --> 02:00:17.113
You secret couldn't be hidden.

02:00:20.725 --> 02:00:23.250
So, now you can't even
take off your eyes from her.

02:00:23.695 --> 02:00:24.286
wait here.

02:00:31.236 --> 02:00:32.601
Here...
Are you happy now?

02:00:35.473 --> 02:00:36.667
They look beautiful.

02:00:36.667 --> 02:00:39.266
They are made-for-each-other.

02:00:43.114 --> 02:00:43.671
Listen mom.

02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:49.279
Look here guys.

02:00:49.279 --> 02:00:50.514
He's sitting here alone.

02:00:52.557 --> 02:00:54.081
Come, welcome.

02:00:54.081 --> 02:00:55.990
Don't be shy.
You're at Punjabi's place.

02:00:57.128 --> 02:00:58.095
Is your friend?

02:01:01.232 --> 02:01:02.199
Have sweet.

02:01:03.168 --> 02:01:05.500
Don't eat all, leave some.

02:01:06.437 --> 02:01:07.267
Mom.
- Eat it.

02:01:07.772 --> 02:01:10.036
It increases love between
the couple.

02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:13.240
we should tell them.

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:14.608
what's going on?

02:01:14.608 --> 02:01:16.408
Control yourself brother-in-law.

02:01:17.615 --> 02:01:18.741
So sweet.

02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:20.409
what a smile!

02:01:21.653 --> 02:01:23.018
Shut up, naughty.

02:01:23.018 --> 02:01:24.281
Don't tease them.

02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:26.721
Come, inside.

02:01:27.525 --> 02:01:28.423
Mom, one minute.

02:01:35.266 --> 02:01:38.531
Not like this. You went holding hand.
Now you have come holding hands.

02:01:40.772 --> 02:01:43.070
why are you being shy today?

02:01:47.412 --> 02:01:48.640
That's the right way.

02:01:53.418 --> 02:01:55.079
Mom, I need to talk to you.

02:01:55.079 --> 02:01:56.678
Go inside and meet grandfather.

02:01:56.678 --> 02:01:57.743
I want to talk now.

02:01:57.743 --> 02:01:59.346
Go, he's waiting for you.

02:01:59.346 --> 02:02:01.449
You've to meet a lot of people.
It's a long queue.

02:02:01.449 --> 02:02:03.153
Go.
Take them.

02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:05.253
Come, brother-in-law.

02:02:11.436 --> 02:02:12.494
Greetings grandpa.

02:02:12.494 --> 02:02:13.366
One minute.

02:02:14.672 --> 02:02:15.639
One minute.

02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:20.701
when I saw him for the first time.
I knew it.

02:02:20.701 --> 02:02:24.612
In my age, one can judge
in the first glimpse.

02:02:24.612 --> 02:02:27.207
that what's going on
in between the girl and boy.

02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:31.487
I asked you.
But lied.

02:02:31.487 --> 02:02:34.525
It must have been your idea
to run away.

02:02:34.525 --> 02:02:36.150
Isn't it?

02:02:37.262 --> 02:02:38.354
Isn't it?

02:02:39.697 --> 02:02:41.722
See...
I knew it.

02:02:41.722 --> 02:02:43.664
She's the naughty one
among them two.

02:02:46.237 --> 02:02:47.295
Anyway...

02:02:47.295 --> 02:02:49.704
Mistake can be forgiven once.

02:02:49.704 --> 02:02:53.403
You made your mistake.
You're forgiven too.

02:02:53.403 --> 02:02:57.107
And now, there should
not be any mistakes.

02:02:57.107 --> 02:02:58.148
Got it?

02:03:06.157 --> 02:03:08.182
Son, be careful.

02:03:08.182 --> 02:03:10.523
She's the naughtiest in the family.

02:03:10.523 --> 02:03:13.189
She has teased us a lot.

02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:15.164
She won't spare you.

02:03:21.372 --> 02:03:23.237
You talk to your mom
immediately, it will fine.

02:03:23.237 --> 02:03:23.774
where's mom?

02:03:26.878 --> 02:03:28.246
what's going on here?

02:03:28.246 --> 02:03:30.782
Everything will be settled.
You go and talk to your mom.

02:03:30.782 --> 02:03:32.181
You come too.

02:03:32.181 --> 02:03:33.182
One minute.

02:03:33.182 --> 02:03:35.742
You two ran away...
when?

02:03:35.742 --> 02:03:37.549
when did you run
holding hands?

02:03:37.549 --> 02:03:39.783
There's a misunderstanding.
Actually...

02:03:39.783 --> 02:03:41.484
Brother-in-law, photo..

02:03:41.484 --> 02:03:43.461
Sister, photo.

02:03:43.461 --> 02:03:45.793
will you take our photo,
friend of the brother-in-law?

02:04:10.822 --> 02:04:12.756
Son, why don't you go
and get fresh.

02:04:12.756 --> 02:04:14.325
I'm very fresh.

02:04:14.325 --> 02:04:16.190
You've had a long travel.

02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:16.919
No.

02:04:20.999 --> 02:04:22.489
Take him upstairs to the guest room.

02:04:28.439 --> 02:04:29.599
Look mom.

02:04:29.599 --> 02:04:33.201
Ok daughter,
tell me how have you been.

02:04:33.201 --> 02:04:35.438
It's been nine months.

02:04:35.438 --> 02:04:37.743
Are you all right?

02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:40.449
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

02:04:40.449 --> 02:04:42.748
Does Aditya keep you well?

02:04:46.924 --> 02:04:47.948
Yes.

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:50.993
Isn't he good with you?

02:04:54.332 --> 02:04:59.497
He cares about even more then you.

02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:08.005
Now tell, why did you
cheat me?

02:05:08.279 --> 02:05:11.009
You were going to run with me,
instead you ran with my sister.

02:05:11.282 --> 02:05:14.740
It's wrong, why did you do
this to her?

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:17.549
what was that I didn't have?

02:05:17.549 --> 02:05:19.886
Tell us.
Do you have an answer?

02:05:19.886 --> 02:05:22.653
Actually...

02:05:22.653 --> 02:05:24.695
what happened?

02:05:24.695 --> 02:05:28.755
Actually there was mistake
due to the darkness.

02:05:28.755 --> 02:05:29.629
Really?

02:05:30.868 --> 02:05:34.429
I thought it was you, but
found your sister in the morning.

02:05:37.742 --> 02:05:40.734
Tell me, who's this guy
that you brought.

02:05:40.734 --> 02:05:41.746
who?

02:05:41.746 --> 02:05:43.771
Your friend.

02:05:44.849 --> 02:05:46.510
Is he my consolation prize?

02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:47.482
in lieu of yourself

02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:50.046
Can I have some space?

02:05:50.321 --> 02:05:52.448
Come on girls leave,
we have to talk.

02:05:53.858 --> 02:05:54.882
Let's go inside.

02:05:57.428 --> 02:06:00.591
You've already married legally,
but we want a function here.

02:06:02.834 --> 02:06:04.825
Don't look at Geet.

02:06:04.825 --> 02:06:06.995
If you have any objection,
we won't do it.

02:06:06.995 --> 02:06:10.563
I want you to talk
to Geet once.

02:06:10.563 --> 02:06:12.802
You don't have any objection.
Don't you?

02:06:14.612 --> 02:06:16.671
Just talk to Geet once.

02:06:16.671 --> 02:06:18.078
That's fine.
It's done.

02:06:19.383 --> 02:06:20.509
You'll have to invite
everyone from your side.

02:06:20.509 --> 02:06:23.349
Of course people from
his side will all come.

02:06:24.455 --> 02:06:25.979
It's good now.

02:06:34.632 --> 02:06:37.658
It's too much.
way out of limits.

02:06:38.369 --> 02:06:39.495
It's a solid confusion.

02:06:39.495 --> 02:06:41.868
Nobody thought it would
have been like that.

02:06:41.868 --> 02:06:44.931
But you don't worry.
Geet's trying to talk to her mom.

02:06:44.931 --> 02:06:47.375
She should've told
her a long ago.

02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:51.082
All the treatment is
being given to you

02:06:51.082 --> 02:06:53.050
And they're trying me
to take bath.

02:06:54.018 --> 02:06:55.679
Enough.
where's Geet?

02:06:55.679 --> 02:06:56.879
I'll talk to her right away.

02:06:56.879 --> 02:06:59.514
wait a second.
She's surrounded by many people.

02:06:59.514 --> 02:07:02.423
I'll talk to her in private.

02:07:02.423 --> 02:07:05.663
Everyone thinks here that
you're my friend.

02:07:05.663 --> 02:07:08.632
If you take her in private
everyone will see it as odd.

02:07:11.969 --> 02:07:14.494
They'll see it odd.

02:07:14.494 --> 02:07:15.903
Then be it odd.

02:07:15.903 --> 02:07:17.708
It's truth.

02:07:17.708 --> 02:07:19.437
That I and her are the couple.

02:07:19.437 --> 02:07:21.078
That exactly what we have to tell them.

02:07:21.078 --> 02:07:24.148
Yes, but let her handle this.

02:07:24.148 --> 02:07:26.776
It's necessary to explain them
in a good way or it will be like

02:07:26.776 --> 02:07:28.910
an insult to family.

02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:30.385
There are many people
present here.

02:07:32.523 --> 02:07:34.047
All these boys...

02:07:34.458 --> 02:07:37.018
They want me to go to
see the sugarcane fields.

02:07:37.018 --> 02:07:38.857
why should I see the
sugarcane fields?

02:07:38.857 --> 02:07:40.693
what's so special about
the sugarcane fields?

02:07:40.693 --> 02:07:42.130
I don't want to see
the sugarcane fields.

02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:44.794
Don't go to see.
Refuse them.

02:07:44.794 --> 02:07:46.166
Don't take tension.

02:07:46.437 --> 02:07:47.961
Everything will be fine.

02:08:02.486 --> 02:08:03.851
Should I tell you something?

02:08:03.851 --> 02:08:06.549
Yours is better then mine.

02:08:07.858 --> 02:08:08.586
Lucky.

02:08:09.727 --> 02:08:11.627
Now tell me,
what's the matter?

02:08:14.532 --> 02:08:16.591
Look mom,

02:08:17.101 --> 02:08:18.932
The things you're doing...

02:08:21.138 --> 02:08:22.469
I mean...

02:08:23.708 --> 02:08:25.198
The thing I want to say...

02:08:27.745 --> 02:08:29.576
There's no problem...

02:08:31.215 --> 02:08:32.682
Everything is fine.

02:08:37.555 --> 02:08:38.954
But here...

02:08:39.690 --> 02:08:40.520
everyone's doing...

02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:47.459
I should lie down for while.

02:08:47.732 --> 02:08:49.199
All right daughter.

02:08:50.568 --> 02:08:51.899
You must be tired.

02:08:52.737 --> 02:08:54.227
Take some rest.

02:08:55.539 --> 02:08:56.631
Sleep.

02:09:12.590 --> 02:09:14.751
Attention everyone.

02:09:15.293 --> 02:09:18.524
On 1 7th...
meaning after two days.

02:09:18.524 --> 02:09:23.260
The temple has approved
the function of marriage.

02:10:19.924 --> 02:10:20.788
Have you told mom?

02:10:20.788 --> 02:10:21.847
No.

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.689
I don't know why.

02:10:24.795 --> 02:10:27.025
I could've told mom very easily,

02:10:27.025 --> 02:10:29.589
even to papa.
I had the chance.

02:10:30.801 --> 02:10:33.167
But I was having
a strange feeling.

02:10:33.167 --> 02:10:35.034
It was like restlessness.

02:10:35.034 --> 02:10:36.835
Like something wrong is
going on.

02:10:37.608 --> 02:10:38.870
Like I'm going to miss the train.

02:10:40.678 --> 02:10:41.235
Come here.

02:10:43.381 --> 02:10:44.609
Let me see.
- what?

02:10:45.983 --> 02:10:46.915
what's this?

02:10:49.987 --> 02:10:50.817
what?

02:10:50.817 --> 02:10:52.287
There

02:10:54.225 --> 02:10:55.658
Your face with so much tension..

02:10:56.394 --> 02:10:57.895
it doesn't suit you.

02:10:57.895 --> 02:10:59.764
You look horrible.

02:10:59.764 --> 02:11:02.927
That face of yours...
Like this.

02:11:06.771 --> 02:11:07.635
Correct.

02:11:07.635 --> 02:11:09.172
You look great this way.

02:11:10.241 --> 02:11:12.943
Keep smiling. If you'll look good,
everything will be good around you.

02:11:12.943 --> 02:11:13.602
Got it?

02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:18.148
You've become just like me.

02:11:23.354 --> 02:11:24.150
Listen.

02:11:25.256 --> 02:11:27.622
Talk to Anjuman, he's a bit troubled.

02:11:27.622 --> 02:11:28.953
I'm coming inside.

02:11:30.394 --> 02:11:31.827
what's going on here?

02:11:33.230 --> 02:11:34.720
One minute,
we want to talk.

02:11:36.667 --> 02:11:41.272
Grandma said, you shouldn't
be together at night till the function.

02:11:41.272 --> 02:11:43.740
Someone has put the right names on you.

02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:45.241
Saali... naughty.

02:11:45.241 --> 02:11:47.678
You've broken my heart,
brother-in-law.

02:11:47.678 --> 02:11:49.771
It's a fight of the lifetime.

02:11:49.771 --> 02:11:51.007
Let's go Geet.

02:11:52.683 --> 02:11:54.014
He's here too.

02:11:54.014 --> 02:11:56.712
Geet, do you... in front of him?

02:11:56.712 --> 02:11:57.855
Shut up.

02:11:57.855 --> 02:11:59.152
we'll talk in the morning.

02:11:59.152 --> 02:12:01.088
It's a cheating.

02:12:01.088 --> 02:12:02.726
Bye brother-in-law.

02:12:02.726 --> 02:12:05.024
Have a good night...
with your friend.

02:12:07.164 --> 02:12:08.096
what happened?

02:12:09.366 --> 02:12:12.130
Geet came to meet you.
She said she'll meet you in morning.

02:12:12.130 --> 02:12:13.670
what?

02:13:16.233 --> 02:13:17.222
Are you ready this early?

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:19.132
Yes, I'm going in some time.

02:13:20.938 --> 02:13:21.996
Are you leaving?

02:13:23.274 --> 02:13:23.968
I have to

02:13:25.943 --> 02:13:27.308
They won't let you go.

02:13:30.014 --> 02:13:31.481
I won't stay this time, Geet.

02:14:00.411 --> 02:14:02.845
You didn't them yet,
no problem.

02:14:02.845 --> 02:14:04.312
Now we'll tell them.

02:14:04.312 --> 02:14:05.871
I tell you how.

02:14:05.871 --> 02:14:07.941
Look, pick someone.

02:14:07.941 --> 02:14:09.178
whoever comes first.

02:14:09.178 --> 02:14:11.221
Mom, papa or uncle.

02:14:11.221 --> 02:14:14.325
And tell them.
That you will marry.

02:14:14.325 --> 02:14:16.816
Not with Aditya
but Anjuman.

02:14:16.816 --> 02:14:19.829
All programs will be same.

02:14:19.829 --> 02:14:21.296
All arrangements will be same.

02:14:21.296 --> 02:14:24.027
Everyone should be happy
as they already are.

02:14:24.027 --> 02:14:28.037
Just replace Aditya with Anjuman.

02:14:28.037 --> 02:14:31.336
As soon as you'll say this,
they'll ask you thousand questions.

02:14:31.336 --> 02:14:33.210
This, that, how, when, etc...

02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:36.847
Then tell them...
How we met.

02:14:36.847 --> 02:14:41.409
How I used to come to your
hostel with my friend to meet you.

02:14:41.409 --> 02:14:44.454
Then how we...

02:15:46.417 --> 02:15:48.408
There was a strange fear in my heart.

02:15:48.408 --> 02:15:50.112
A restlessness.

02:15:51.321 --> 02:15:52.583
Like something wrong is
being happened.

02:15:54.258 --> 02:15:55.919
Like I'm going to miss the train.

02:16:15.446 --> 02:16:17.505
Geet, wait.

02:16:17.505 --> 02:16:19.139
Are you going to tell them now?

02:16:20.017 --> 02:16:21.382
I'll too.
we'll tell them together.

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:50.568
what happened?

02:16:51.982 --> 02:16:52.573
what happened, Geet?

02:16:52.573 --> 02:16:53.615
Is he coming?

02:16:55.052 --> 02:16:56.485
who?
- Anjuman.

02:16:57.521 --> 02:16:59.022
Is he coming?

02:16:59.022 --> 02:17:00.182
Yes

02:17:00.724 --> 02:17:01.713
Is he looking here?

02:17:03.593 --> 02:17:04.356
Yes he's looking here.

02:17:22.412 --> 02:17:24.312
I'll always take this
as your favor.

02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:26.344
Just one.

02:17:27.416 --> 02:17:29.077
That you brought Anjuman back.

02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:31.485
Or I could never have realized

02:17:32.356 --> 02:17:33.549
what exactly I want.

02:17:35.092 --> 02:17:37.719
I'm going to listen
to my heart from now on.

02:17:40.397 --> 02:17:42.227
Then everything will be fine.

02:20:48.385 --> 02:20:49.784
Children!

02:20:49.784 --> 02:20:52.287
Your parents had been
very naughty.

02:20:52.287 --> 02:20:54.916
They lied again and again.

02:20:54.916 --> 02:20:59.396
But I caught them at
the first sight.

02:20:59.396 --> 02:21:01.261
Didn't I?

02:21:01.261 --> 02:21:02.628
Yes grandpa.

02:21:02.628 --> 02:21:05.497
See?
It was true, right?

02:21:05.497 --> 02:21:06.831
Yes grandpa.

02:21:06.831 --> 02:21:07.911
Children!

02:21:11.308 --> 02:21:13.776
In our age, a glimpse is enough

02:21:13.776 --> 02:21:15.812
to tell what's going on

02:21:15.812 --> 02:21:19.440
between the boy and the girl.

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:20.244
Yes grandpa.
