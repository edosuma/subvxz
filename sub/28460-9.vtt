WEBVTT

00:04.632 --> 00:06.937
_

00:07.047 --> 00:09.218
Hey, babe. Good workout?

00:09.274 --> 00:12.647
Ooh! I just feel like

00:12.672 --> 00:15.111
no matter how low I drop
it in cardio strip class,

00:15.196 --> 00:17.780
I keep looking in the mirror
expecting to see a new me,

00:17.865 --> 00:20.099
and see the same old me staring back.

00:20.124 --> 00:22.952
Oh, honey, listen, I think
you've been doing so great.

00:23.037 --> 00:26.038
But if you need a little extra
motivation, just do what I do.

00:26.124 --> 00:29.041
Not tie my robe when
FedEx drops off a package?

00:29.127 --> 00:31.794
No! That was an accident.

00:31.846 --> 00:33.246
- Mm.
- I meant

00:33.270 --> 00:34.764
I buy myself a treat

00:34.799 --> 00:37.767
as a reminder of what it
is I'm working towards.

00:37.802 --> 00:39.885
I guess I could buy you something.

00:39.971 --> 00:42.388
No, not me. You.

00:42.473 --> 00:43.889
If you really want to look good,

00:43.975 --> 00:45.401
but yourself something nice.

00:47.145 --> 00:49.562
Heather, you were right!

00:49.647 --> 00:52.949
I bought something,
and it's a game changer.

00:52.984 --> 00:54.817
Oh! Oh.

00:54.869 --> 00:56.152
Well, what do you think?

00:56.204 --> 00:59.071
Well... what do you think?

00:59.157 --> 01:00.489
I love it!

01:00.541 --> 01:01.991
- Oh, yeah.
- I, uh...

01:02.076 --> 01:04.492
I feel like I'm in
defiance of God's will.

01:04.545 --> 01:09.081
Yeah, well, I mean, what else
is there to say, other than...

01:09.167 --> 01:11.968
you look very handsome.

01:12.003 --> 01:14.007
What do you say? You want to
take it for a little test-drive?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.504
Yeah. Uh...

01:15.590 --> 01:16.671
- Uh...
- Just don't touch the top,

01:16.696 --> 01:19.008
'cause that glue still has to set.

01:19.060 --> 01:20.643
- And the sides kind of hurt, so...
- Okay. Okay.

01:20.678 --> 01:22.144
- Ah, well, we'll do it later.
- Okay.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.513
I'm gonna go upstairs
and take off everything.

01:24.599 --> 01:27.060
Well, almost everything.

01:27.085 --> 01:29.120
Okay. Yeah.

01:29.145 --> 01:31.854
- Oh, see? Hairs.
- Okay.

01:34.192 --> 01:36.859
Thank you so much for
responding to my text.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.445
Uh, there's something I
need to talk to you about

01:39.530 --> 01:41.052
concerning your father.

01:41.076 --> 01:42.698
It's his heart again, isn't it?

01:42.784 --> 01:44.913
- Told you.
- No.

01:44.937 --> 01:47.359
It's not his heart. It is his head.

01:47.384 --> 01:48.990
Like a brain tumor?

01:49.015 --> 01:50.538
Told you.

01:50.563 --> 01:54.872
No. Your dad... has
started wearing a toupee.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.295
Told you.

01:56.381 --> 01:58.047
Okay, the-the point is,

01:58.132 --> 01:59.799
is that your dad has struggled,

01:59.884 --> 02:01.449
you know, with feeling
good about himself.

02:01.474 --> 02:04.303
And if adding some hair
makes him feel like a new man,

02:04.389 --> 02:07.807
then our job is to just
support him in that.

02:07.892 --> 02:11.394
So, the same rules as when you
went through your romper phase?

02:11.446 --> 02:13.229
- What?
- You looked stupid.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.295
We-we just didn't know if
you knew you looked stupid.

02:15.320 --> 02:15.916
Mm.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.534
Yeah. Just like that.

02:18.569 --> 02:22.071
Hey, guys! Oh, what do
we think of the new me

02:22.156 --> 02:25.008
on a scale of one to ten?
Don't be afraid to say 11.

02:26.077 --> 02:27.410
It's what we're all thinking.

02:27.462 --> 02:29.378
We're just kids.

02:29.414 --> 02:32.415
Who cares what we think?
Most of us don't even vote.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.251
Ah, the reviews are
in, and they are rave.

02:35.303 --> 02:38.087
The barista at the coffee shop
that always calls me Tom...

02:38.172 --> 02:39.603
She still called me Tom,

02:39.628 --> 02:42.007
but this time, she said it with a smile.

02:42.032 --> 02:43.259
New Tim is a hit!

02:46.764 --> 02:48.514
Yeah, you're looking
pretty sharp, Timmy.

02:48.599 --> 02:50.266
Oh, I know it. If you need any help

02:50.318 --> 02:51.851
fixing your whole
thing, I'm here for you.

02:51.876 --> 02:53.843
Thank-thank you.

02:54.266 --> 02:56.433
Okay, thank you so much
for not saying anything.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.606
I know it's hard.

02:57.692 --> 02:59.090
Of course I'm not gonna
say anything, Heather.

02:59.115 --> 03:01.332
He's obviously struggling.

03:01.751 --> 03:04.035
Oh, man, my allergies are acting up.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.916
Do we have any idea what kind of
hair that thing is made out of?

03:06.951 --> 03:08.918
But you're only allergic to cats.

03:08.953 --> 03:10.920
Oh, no.

03:11.602 --> 03:14.039
Tim, I just want to tell you

03:14.125 --> 03:16.092
that I think your toupee looks great,

03:16.127 --> 03:18.103
no matter what John says.

03:18.679 --> 03:20.106
What did John say?

03:20.131 --> 03:21.249
Oh. Well, now that I know

03:21.274 --> 03:22.965
that you didn't hear, I can't remember.

03:23.050 --> 03:24.266
He didn't like my toupee?

03:24.302 --> 03:25.885
I think he's just jealous because

03:25.970 --> 03:27.770
someone else is getting
hair compliments.

03:27.795 --> 03:28.984
- Hmm.
- And he doesn't like that,

03:29.008 --> 03:30.139
but who cares about John?

03:30.224 --> 03:34.093
I think it looks amazing, no
matter what everyone else says.

03:34.656 --> 03:36.645
Everyone?

03:36.731 --> 03:39.148
He doesn't have a
toupee made out of a cat.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.650
So, none of you like the new me.

03:42.703 --> 03:44.787
Tim, listen, it's...

03:44.822 --> 03:47.490
It's just that we all love the old you.

03:47.542 --> 03:50.243
I love old me, too, but he's gone.

03:50.268 --> 03:53.078
And the new me uses 25% less sunscreen.

03:53.164 --> 03:54.580
Ignore them, Tim.

03:54.605 --> 03:56.248
I think you look so sexy.

03:56.334 --> 03:57.500
What?

03:57.552 --> 03:58.751
Heather,

03:58.776 --> 04:00.656
you're the one who told
me to try something new.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.976
Yeah, because

04:02.001 --> 04:04.840
I thought, you know, maybe
you would buy a new jacket.

04:04.892 --> 04:07.009
At worst, a big gold chain.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.181
I didn't think you would do
something crazy like this.

04:09.230 --> 04:12.181
How is this crazy? I
can wear it in a pool.

04:12.233 --> 04:14.517
Okay, honey, I-I love
you, but you can't just

04:14.569 --> 04:18.353
put on new hair and
completely change who you are.

04:18.406 --> 04:19.482
Ah, you're just saying that

04:19.507 --> 04:20.694
'cause you know me as a bald guy.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.691
Anybody who meets me
now would have no idea.

04:22.777 --> 04:25.528
They might if they met
you during a strong breeze.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.113
The salesman said they
can handle up to 20 knots.

04:28.199 --> 04:30.546
Honey, don't be upset.

04:30.639 --> 04:33.161
Maybe I'll always be
old Tim to you guys,

04:33.186 --> 04:35.538
but tomorrow, I'm gonna get
on a stage and give a speech

04:35.590 --> 04:37.811
in front of a bunch of
doctors who've never met me,

04:37.836 --> 04:41.043
and you mark my words,
they'll only know the new Tim.

04:43.975 --> 04:46.382
And now our featured speaker
for today's symposium,

04:46.434 --> 04:48.133
Dr. Tim Hughes.

04:50.577 --> 04:52.410
All right.

04:54.343 --> 04:55.893
Thank you.

04:57.562 --> 05:00.342
I'm here today to talk to
you about honesty in medicine,

05:00.367 --> 05:01.950
but also in life.

05:01.975 --> 05:03.271
That's right,

05:03.296 --> 05:06.023
because the transparency with
which we present ourselves...

05:09.757 --> 05:12.508
Oh, right.

05:14.507 --> 05:16.161
Okay.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.804
Aah.

05:21.844 --> 05:23.734
_

05:28.054 --> 05:29.592
Jen, you're back!

05:29.644 --> 05:31.927
You were gone so long, we
all forgot you worked here.

05:32.013 --> 05:34.028
You think maybe you should label that,

05:34.053 --> 05:35.773
so I don't accidentally
put it in my coffee?

05:35.850 --> 05:37.766
Oh, well, here's a tip.

05:37.852 --> 05:40.069
Maybe don't drink milk
out of a baby bottle.

05:40.950 --> 05:42.283
Hey, Jen.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.772
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

05:43.858 --> 05:46.075
How is baby... what's-her-face?

05:46.110 --> 05:48.027
Uh, Talia. Yeah, she's great,

05:48.112 --> 05:52.281
and, uh, she loves her Starbucks
gift card, so thank you.

05:52.366 --> 05:55.417
Oh. Sure. I... I had no
idea I sent her anything.

05:55.453 --> 05:58.120
- Oh, well, that's even better.
- Uh, so I'll see you tonight?

05:58.172 --> 05:59.872
S-Sorry. Tonight?

05:59.957 --> 06:01.540
Yeah, we're all getting
together for drinks

06:01.626 --> 06:03.208
to celebrate the monster year we had.

06:03.294 --> 06:05.094
Eve was supposed to tell you.

06:05.129 --> 06:06.595
Did I not do that?

06:06.631 --> 06:07.763
Paul, do not make her

06:07.798 --> 06:08.964
go celebrate the monster year

06:09.016 --> 06:10.617
she had nothing to do with.

06:10.641 --> 06:12.070
She has a baby to get home to.

06:12.095 --> 06:14.170
Right. Yeah, go be with, um...

06:14.195 --> 06:16.437
What's his name?

06:16.765 --> 06:18.474
I want to say it starts with a "B",

06:18.559 --> 06:20.559
but that could just be for "baby."

06:20.645 --> 06:21.810
Yeah. No, you got it.

06:21.862 --> 06:23.221
- Yes!
- Good memory.

06:23.245 --> 06:26.815
Okay. Which reminds me, this
contract was due yesterday,

06:26.901 --> 06:28.651
so let's get it redlined ASAP.

06:28.703 --> 06:30.569
We're on it.

06:30.655 --> 06:31.954
Hey,

06:31.989 --> 06:33.489
since you decided you didn't want

06:33.574 --> 06:36.069
to go tonight, do you mind?

06:36.094 --> 06:37.326
Oh.

06:37.378 --> 06:40.383
And here's a tip: if you're gonna lie

06:40.407 --> 06:42.631
about having a baby,
maybe don't post photos

06:42.667 --> 06:45.918
of yourself topless on
a fancy lounge chair.

06:47.793 --> 06:50.181
It was a hospital bed.

06:51.175 --> 06:54.843
I'm stuck here while Eve and
Elle get face time with Paul,

06:54.929 --> 06:56.762
which is the only way to make partner.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.315
Sorry. I'm here. It's just that

06:59.350 --> 07:02.601
the phone, uh, fell in between
the cushions of the couch.

07:02.687 --> 07:04.047
Did you hear anything I just said?

07:04.105 --> 07:06.597
I was explaining how
I'm feeling overwhelmed

07:06.622 --> 07:09.158
by trying to be the perfect
mom and the perfect lawyer.

07:09.193 --> 07:11.694
I think you're perfect. I just...

07:12.817 --> 07:15.081
I want to make it home
before bedtime, you know?

07:15.106 --> 07:17.333
I miss the girls. Hey,
has Talia changed a lot

07:17.368 --> 07:18.784
since I've been gone?

07:18.869 --> 07:20.786
I started calling her Tal,

07:20.871 --> 07:24.006
but then I realized that would
mean we named her Tal Short.

07:24.515 --> 07:27.042
Well, that's either
gonna be good or horrible.

07:27.128 --> 07:29.511
Look, honey, I-if going out
tonight is important, go.

07:29.547 --> 07:33.215
All right? I mean, I-I'll keep
the kids up until you come home.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.221
Really?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.968
Yeah. I mean, I'm terrible
at putting 'em to sleep,

07:36.053 --> 07:37.519
so it's perfect.

07:37.555 --> 07:41.454
Shoot. I just spilled
breast milk all over me.

07:41.479 --> 07:44.026
What am I gonna do?
I can't go like this.

07:44.061 --> 07:45.728
Okay, you want to know
what? I'm gonna call someone

07:45.780 --> 07:48.230
to help you, okay? But just
so you're not disappointed

07:48.282 --> 07:50.566
when you see her, it's gonna be Colleen.

07:53.404 --> 07:56.071
I can't believe we're so
aligned on politics and religion.

07:56.123 --> 07:58.969
That was a huge gamble
you took, but it paid off.

07:58.994 --> 08:00.443
Hey! Jen!

08:00.468 --> 08:02.124
You made it.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.757
Why aren't you with your family?

08:03.782 --> 08:06.165
Shouldn't you be making mac and
cheese and some kind of nugget?

08:06.250 --> 08:08.584
Nope. No, I can stay as
long as I want tonight.

08:08.636 --> 08:11.197
Yeah, because I'm devoted to this firm.

08:11.222 --> 08:13.949
Hey, have you talked
about the Anderson case?

08:13.974 --> 08:15.664
- No.
- Well, now we have,

08:15.688 --> 08:16.990
so next round's on the client.

08:17.015 --> 08:19.405
- Am I right?
- I love it!

08:19.430 --> 08:21.096
I can get you a woman.

08:21.182 --> 08:22.398
Whoa, Eve.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.349
Let's just stick with champagne.

08:24.435 --> 08:25.267
Yeah.

08:25.352 --> 08:26.602
Jen, come on in. Champagne?

08:26.687 --> 08:28.404
Uh, would love some.

08:30.658 --> 08:32.736
And I woke up on the
roof of the library,

08:32.760 --> 08:34.610
naked, covered in red paint.

08:34.695 --> 08:37.029
And that is how you get out
of paying overdue book fines.

08:38.115 --> 08:39.581
I knew you were a reader.

08:39.616 --> 08:41.950
Paul, Paul, Paul?

08:42.035 --> 08:43.919
- Mm-hmm. 
- We got you a drink.

08:43.953 --> 08:45.537
It's a lemon drop!

08:45.623 --> 08:48.257
I am so lucky I have
so many best friends.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.877
Paul, Paul, Paul.

08:52.645 --> 08:54.630
To your success.

08:56.517 --> 08:57.466
Honey,

08:57.518 --> 08:58.634
where you going with the...

08:58.659 --> 09:01.751
- Hey, everything okay?
- Jen, where are you?

09:01.884 --> 09:02.805
Okay, I-it's...

09:02.857 --> 09:05.891
it's 8:15. Tha-That's like
midnight for these girls.

09:07.759 --> 09:08.898
You there?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.813
Jen? Jen, get over here.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.797
I'm telling everyone about my
unforgettable trip to Santa Fe.

09:13.822 --> 09:15.400
I'm going next week.

09:15.486 --> 09:16.985
Hey.

09:17.037 --> 09:18.403
I'm-I'm so sorry.

09:18.489 --> 09:19.988
I-I actually have to go.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.324
So sorry.

09:23.015 --> 09:24.214
So...

09:26.811 --> 09:28.144
Hi.

09:28.169 --> 09:30.887
Mommy's... home.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.510 --> 09:45.062
Hey, have either of you seen the
contract I finished yesterday?

09:45.087 --> 09:46.586
- No.
- Haven't seen it.

09:46.611 --> 09:48.183
Jen, why'd you run off last night?

09:48.235 --> 09:50.486
Oh, sorry. I-I had to
get home to my girls.

09:50.521 --> 09:53.105
Oh, too bad. You missed hearing
about my watch collection.

09:53.190 --> 09:54.606
I'm gonna start one.

09:54.692 --> 09:56.144
- Oh.
- Eve, Elle,

09:56.168 --> 09:57.493
thanks for redlining this contract.

09:57.528 --> 09:59.444
It was our pleasure, Paul.

09:59.530 --> 10:00.863
Wait, I did that work.

10:00.915 --> 10:02.364
Oh, that's not possible.

10:02.416 --> 10:03.866
She just had a baby,

10:03.918 --> 10:06.624
which means probably her
hormones are making her lie.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.188
- Or bad character.
- Oh.

10:08.213 --> 10:11.623
Okay, guys, hey, look, our
office has an awesome work vibe.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.041
Please don't harsh that.

10:13.127 --> 10:14.960
Wait, look, there's a stain on it.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.045
I made that. That proves I did the work.

10:17.131 --> 10:18.881
Actually, that's from my coffee cup.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.133
Everyone knows I drink
coffee. It's kind of my thing.

10:21.218 --> 10:22.218
See?

10:22.269 --> 10:23.552
Well, that looks too big.

10:23.604 --> 10:25.860
Uh, because that ring
is from my protein shake.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.625
I drink one every morning before
I douse the donuts in salt.

10:28.650 --> 10:29.892
That doesn't fit.

10:29.944 --> 10:31.393
Story of my life.

10:32.194 --> 10:33.894
Here, try this.

10:37.067 --> 10:38.534
It's a perfect fit.

10:38.569 --> 10:40.152
I'll take that.

10:40.237 --> 10:42.154
Oh.

10:42.239 --> 10:44.323
And I'll-I'll just... I'll redo that.

10:44.946 --> 10:46.469
Okay.

10:48.704 --> 10:50.929
Hey, look who made it home tonight!

10:50.954 --> 10:52.548
Yeah, and with good news.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.384
I am back on the partner track.

10:55.419 --> 10:56.552
How did that happen?

10:56.587 --> 10:57.947
It's because I spilled breast milk

10:58.005 --> 10:59.504
on one of my files.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.363
Oh.

11:01.388 --> 11:04.108
Well, that's one way of doing it.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.179
_

11:07.413 --> 11:10.998
Mom, do you want creole or soul
food for your retirement party?

11:11.083 --> 11:12.203
I keep pitching Cajun,

11:12.251 --> 11:14.751
but it doesn't seem to
have inspired the room.

11:14.776 --> 11:15.896
I just don't understand

11:15.921 --> 11:17.843
why we can't just do Caribbean jerk.

11:17.868 --> 11:20.424
Why don't we get one of
those really big subs?

11:20.476 --> 11:22.926
What does that have
to do with retirement?

11:22.978 --> 11:25.729
You're-you're planning
the retirement party?

11:25.764 --> 11:28.090
There's no rush, is there?

11:28.115 --> 11:29.933
What? No rush?

11:29.985 --> 11:32.686
I've been waiting for
this day since I retired.

11:32.771 --> 11:34.862
Mom, think about all
the things you can do.

11:34.887 --> 11:36.607
You can fly off at a moment's notice,

11:36.692 --> 11:37.729
see the world.

11:37.754 --> 11:39.676
Mom, you guys could go to
Spain, and you could eat...

11:39.701 --> 11:40.744
A rat!

11:40.779 --> 11:41.912
Oh, is that what they do?

11:41.947 --> 11:43.598
I-I don't want to do that.

11:43.622 --> 11:45.204
Oh! No, there's a rat.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.540
It just scurried under the sofa.

11:47.575 --> 11:49.769
- Mm!
- Okay, okay. Calm down.

11:49.794 --> 11:52.378
I'll... I will call our
exterminator for you.

11:52.414 --> 11:53.663
Is he the best?

11:54.145 --> 11:55.481
Well...

11:56.614 --> 11:58.418
I'm so sorry, honey,

11:58.470 --> 12:00.753
but I just will not
have the retirement party

12:00.805 --> 12:03.089
until Oscar gets that rat.

12:03.141 --> 12:05.842
And who knows how long that'll take?

12:05.927 --> 12:06.893
Got him.

12:06.928 --> 12:08.011
Yep.

12:08.096 --> 12:09.634
Trap worked.

12:09.884 --> 12:10.884
Killed him dead.

12:10.932 --> 12:13.042
But surely there are more!

12:13.067 --> 12:15.351
It's a herd, right?

12:15.376 --> 12:16.602
Herd of rats?

12:16.627 --> 12:17.937
'Course I heard of rats.

12:18.023 --> 12:19.188
I'm a 'sterminator.

12:19.274 --> 12:20.523
It's my business.

12:20.608 --> 12:22.775
Great! Well, party's back on.

12:22.827 --> 12:24.744
You'll be retired before you know it.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.946
Soon, you'll be as aimless as I am.

12:27.032 --> 12:29.282
- Right.
- No, you're gonna love it.

12:29.367 --> 12:30.583
The hours all blend together.

12:30.618 --> 12:33.485
10:00 and 3:00 are the same,
because they're both day.

12:33.510 --> 12:36.956
And then, suddenly, it's dinner, and...

12:37.042 --> 12:38.374
then you're done.

12:38.460 --> 12:39.460
Oh.

12:39.485 --> 12:40.401
Mm-hmm.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.462
Are you sure you got them all?

12:42.487 --> 12:44.856
Yep, you's rat-free.

12:44.881 --> 12:47.050
You want to keep it for
your trophy room or...

12:47.135 --> 12:48.384
- No.
- No.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.720
All right. I'm gonna barbecue it.

12:50.805 --> 12:53.439
Got a tailgate tomorrow.

12:53.475 --> 12:54.640
- John!
- Yeah.

12:54.726 --> 12:56.893
Call Oscar! I saw another rat.

12:56.978 --> 12:58.394
- A rat?
- Yeah.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.812
Oh, no.

12:59.864 --> 13:02.448
We're gonna have to
cancel the party again?

13:02.484 --> 13:04.817
I'm so disappointed.

13:04.903 --> 13:06.319
Wh-Where'd it go?

13:06.371 --> 13:07.737
Oh, it's gone now.

13:07.822 --> 13:09.405
Don't even bother to look for it.

13:09.491 --> 13:11.157
And by the noises it was making,

13:11.209 --> 13:13.326
it was calling its friends.

13:13.411 --> 13:14.940
What'd it sound like?

13:15.541 --> 13:16.329
Oh.

13:16.414 --> 13:18.164
Um...

13:18.249 --> 13:19.672
Like, uh...

13:26.213 --> 13:28.163
That sounds like trouble.

13:30.729 --> 13:32.261
These might be plops.

13:32.347 --> 13:34.359
Only one way to tell.

13:38.289 --> 13:39.709
Raisins.

13:39.734 --> 13:42.688
Yep. Ain't no rats here.

13:42.774 --> 13:44.857
It's too bad we postponed the party.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.250
You could always
postpone the postponement.

13:47.275 --> 13:49.529
Do the ponement post-rodent.

13:49.614 --> 13:51.280
He's making a lot of sense.

13:51.366 --> 13:52.165
Am I?

13:52.200 --> 13:53.783
We'll do the party tomorrow,

13:53.868 --> 13:56.575
and-and then it's
official... you're retired.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.767
I-It's just you and me,

13:58.792 --> 14:01.541
until, one day, it's you or me.

14:01.626 --> 14:03.876
No. I'm certain there was a rat.

14:03.962 --> 14:06.879
And if he can't find it, well,
we'll just never have the party.

14:06.965 --> 14:08.881
That's the only thing that makes sense.

14:08.967 --> 14:11.134
Okay. You the boss, Miss Joan.

14:11.219 --> 14:12.635
I'll be here all night.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.054
I ain't gonna quit till he gone.

14:15.106 --> 14:16.472
All night?

14:16.558 --> 14:17.890
Well, you heard him.

14:17.976 --> 14:20.643
He ain't gonna quit till he gone.

14:23.493 --> 14:24.897
Miss Joan.

14:24.983 --> 14:27.733
I heard some rumblin's. I
figured maybe there was a rat

14:27.786 --> 14:29.402
down here doing some cupboard dumpin'.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.904
No. I just couldn't sleep. I'm sorry.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.906
W-Would you like some tea?

14:33.992 --> 14:35.491
I try not to drink on the job.

14:35.577 --> 14:36.876
Got to keep the old tool sharp.

14:36.911 --> 14:38.044
- Ooh. Oh!
- Yeah...

14:38.079 --> 14:39.624
Oh, whoop. That was there.

14:39.649 --> 14:41.881
Yep, that dent was definitely there.

14:41.916 --> 14:43.593
Well, I better go set some,

14:43.618 --> 14:45.718
uh, trackin' powder at
your points of entry.

14:45.753 --> 14:49.255
Looks like cocaine,
works like cocaine, but...

14:49.340 --> 14:51.424
do not attempt to use it as such.

14:51.509 --> 14:53.092
Okay, thank you. I'll remember that

14:53.144 --> 14:55.728
if I snort anything from the floor.

14:55.763 --> 14:58.764
- Mm-hmm. 
- You're very dedicated to your work.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.650
I love my occupation.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.352
Do you ever think about retiring?

15:03.438 --> 15:06.550
As long as I got oxygen
left in these lungs,

15:06.575 --> 15:09.409
I'm gonna keep trying to
stick a hot poker into theirs.

15:10.093 --> 15:12.235
We are what we do, Oscar, huh?

15:12.260 --> 15:14.197
And-and we do what we are.

15:14.282 --> 15:15.414
That's beautiful.

15:15.450 --> 15:16.504
Oh.

15:16.529 --> 15:19.368
Well, as I said to my wife,
Tulip, on our weddin' night,

15:19.454 --> 15:21.370
"I'm-a slip into your crawl space."

15:21.456 --> 15:24.145
No, dear, don't. I have a confession.

15:24.959 --> 15:26.626
Ain't no rats, is there?

15:26.711 --> 15:28.044
No.

15:28.129 --> 15:30.546
Yeah, I knew I ain't
smelled no rats, Miss Joan.

15:30.632 --> 15:34.634
I didn't want to have my party,
because the truth is that...

15:35.334 --> 15:37.984
I'm never gonna retire.

15:39.023 --> 15:40.439
Well...

15:40.475 --> 15:43.226
my job here is done, so I can indulge.

15:43.311 --> 15:44.716
Oh! Oh. Oh.

15:44.741 --> 15:46.479
- That was there.
- Yeah.

15:46.531 --> 15:48.318
- Pour me some tea.
- Okay.

15:48.343 --> 15:50.449
People say I got the gift of gab.

15:50.485 --> 15:52.151
- You do?
- Yep.

15:52.237 --> 15:54.620
- Well, gift it to me.
- Well...

15:54.656 --> 15:56.289
My wife, Tulip, says

15:56.324 --> 15:58.574
I'll probably give you
a run for your money.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.410
- No.
- Yep. She says this ain't working right.

16:01.435 --> 16:03.162
No, you don't need any therapy.

16:03.214 --> 16:04.580
You're a happy guy.

16:04.666 --> 16:06.386
Yeah. That's what I tell her.

16:06.411 --> 16:07.833
Then I tell her to shut up.

16:07.886 --> 16:09.502
Oh, no, no, don't do that, honey.

16:09.554 --> 16:11.420
- Yeah.
- No, don't tell her to shut up.

16:11.506 --> 16:15.174
- I say, "I'm happy. Shut up."
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.339
Maybe she's unhappy.

16:17.364 --> 16:18.947
Yeah, she probably unhappy, too.

16:18.972 --> 16:21.180
- Well, maybe you could say...
- So she should shut up about it.

16:21.232 --> 16:23.683
No, no, no, no, no.

16:25.270 --> 16:27.153
So, you're not angry with me?

16:27.188 --> 16:29.021
I had a feeling. Why do you think

16:29.073 --> 16:30.940
I was racing to throw you that party?

16:31.025 --> 16:33.326
Because the airlines
forced you to retire,

16:33.361 --> 16:35.938
and you don't have anything to do.

16:35.963 --> 16:37.830
What do you say we, uh, go upstairs

16:37.865 --> 16:41.033
and celebrate your un-retirement?

16:41.119 --> 16:42.952
A rat!

16:43.037 --> 16:46.289
Well, if you're not in the mood,
I mean, that-that's okay, too.

16:46.374 --> 16:48.674
No, no, John, it's a real rat.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.715
John?

16:50.740 --> 16:52.239
John?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.594
_

16:56.509 --> 16:59.836
We're going to get juice
boxes for our kitchen.

16:59.861 --> 17:01.532
- Hmm.
- Okay.

17:02.595 --> 17:04.509
- Yeah.
- Damn it, Joanie,

17:04.534 --> 17:08.136
recycling went out yesterday...
Why is this still here?

17:08.161 --> 17:09.042
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

17:09.079 --> 17:10.411
- Dad!
- What?

17:10.463 --> 17:11.746
That was a playhouse.

17:11.830 --> 17:12.914
Where?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.482
The box.

17:14.507 --> 17:16.173
Oh, my God.

17:16.198 --> 17:17.835
Were the kids inside?

17:17.921 --> 17:19.721
Oh! Our playhouse.

17:19.756 --> 17:22.757
We were gonna live here
when we got married.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.259
I guess it's good it got destroyed,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.215
- 'cause that would have been weird.
- Yep.

17:26.241 --> 17:28.958
Come on, kids. You want
to play with something?

17:28.983 --> 17:30.958
Let me show you my
rusty knife collection.

17:30.983 --> 17:31.911
Man.

17:31.936 --> 17:33.351
Dude, if you're gonna
build 'em a playhouse,

17:33.436 --> 17:34.936
at least build 'em one that lasts.

17:46.783 --> 17:49.117
This thing is so dope.

17:49.681 --> 17:51.297
What are you guys doing?

17:51.322 --> 17:53.664
Making a playhouse. No dads allowed.

17:53.689 --> 17:55.632
Except for us. That's
a really confusing rule.

17:55.657 --> 17:56.624
We need to change that.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.536
Uh, uh, Matt said that I could hold

17:58.561 --> 17:59.843
the wood when he's cutting it.

17:59.868 --> 18:01.629
- Ah.
- Yeah. I'm thinking about it.

18:01.654 --> 18:04.801
What do you think about adding
a slide for-for quick getaways?

18:04.826 --> 18:05.826
Totally.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.302
You're gonna need a quick getaway

18:07.387 --> 18:09.804
when this house of
cards collapses on you.

18:11.641 --> 18:13.308
Well, he's just saying that
because he doesn't love you.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.643
This is gonna be the best fort ever.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.146
Wow!

18:18.198 --> 18:21.115
This is exactly as I envisioned it.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.400
I mean, I would kiss you right now,

18:22.485 --> 18:23.985
but I don't want to be judged.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.835
I don't know, the slide
is a little garbage bag-y

18:26.860 --> 18:27.912
for what I was going for,

18:27.937 --> 18:29.467
but at least it's solid.

18:35.650 --> 18:38.082
Oh, sorry. It had leaves on it.

18:38.168 --> 18:39.834
What the hell, Dad?
That took us two days.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.336
You just blew our house down.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.305
Well, that's because it's
shoddy workmanship, Greg.

18:44.341 --> 18:46.588
It wasn't me. Matt said he
knew what he was doing...

18:46.613 --> 18:48.650
Which he obviously didn't.
I mean, maybe if I could have

18:48.675 --> 18:50.276
- held some of the wood...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:50.301 --> 18:51.706
You didn't know what
you were doing, either.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.105
Honestly, this is sad.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.830
My dad taught me how to
build, his dad taught him,

18:56.855 --> 18:59.270
and you kids just
weren't brought up right.

18:59.356 --> 19:01.272
Dad, you brought us up.

19:01.358 --> 19:02.940
I don't see it that way.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.361
This is not our fault.

19:06.711 --> 19:08.667
This is Dad's fault.

19:08.816 --> 19:10.999
God, I feel so much better. Don't you?

19:11.034 --> 19:13.315
A little bit, but blaming
Dad's sort of a catchall for me.

19:13.370 --> 19:14.370
Yeah, that's true.

19:14.688 --> 19:15.803
- Dad?
- Mm-mm?

19:15.828 --> 19:17.111
Have a good look.

19:17.136 --> 19:18.586
This is your legacy.

19:18.611 --> 19:21.064
We are your embarrassments.

19:21.463 --> 19:22.633
Oh, no.

19:22.658 --> 19:23.878
Oh, so...

19:23.930 --> 19:26.424
this is what shame feels like?

19:27.217 --> 19:30.218
I'm gonna teach you kids
how to build a playhouse.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.687
You also never taught
us how to tie a tie.

19:32.940 --> 19:35.096
A tie? Is...

19:35.167 --> 19:37.250
Let's do the playhouse first.

19:38.228 --> 19:40.061
Hey, Dad, check it out.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.901
We were able to fit all of these bricks

19:41.926 --> 19:43.543
and 50 pounds of mortar.

19:44.355 --> 19:45.700
You gonna help, Dad?

19:45.735 --> 19:47.485
Well, how the hell
are you two gonna learn

19:47.570 --> 19:48.995
if I do all the work for you?

19:49.020 --> 19:51.449
And I told you to get
five pounds of mortar.

19:51.856 --> 19:53.439
I know.

19:53.464 --> 19:54.909
That's why I got...

19:55.214 --> 19:57.912
45 pounds of backup mortar.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.605
Aw, we can flush the
rest down the toilet.

20:01.113 --> 20:02.488
Good call, Dad.

20:03.793 --> 20:08.028
- Thank you for our playhouse!
- They love the playhouse, Dad.

20:08.053 --> 20:09.685
And if you close all
the windows and doors,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.342
- it doubles as a pizza oven.
- Yeah.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.678
It was so fun building
this with you guys.

20:14.092 --> 20:16.676
Yep. That foundation is as strong

20:16.701 --> 20:18.182
as the bonds of our family.

20:18.287 --> 20:21.116
Your kids' kids'll be playing in that.

20:21.141 --> 20:23.475
Sad I won't be here to see it.

20:24.161 --> 20:26.691
I will have moved to Florida by then.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.477
Excuse me. Water and Power.
I'm here to read your meters.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.028
Oh, yeah. It's right there.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.337
Underneath that brick, uh...

20:33.362 --> 20:34.971
Oh.

20:34.996 --> 20:37.363
Oh, you can go right in.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.238
What?

20:41.291 --> 20:42.873
Hello.
