04:23.763 --> 04:26.349
Phil made sure that his kids

04:26.432 --> 04:28.476
wouldn't follow
that same pattern.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.644
<i>- Oh, it was a lot of love,</i>

04:29.727 --> 04:30.853
<i>a lot of discipline.</i>

04:30.937 --> 04:32.105
<i>Like, my dad didn't--</i>

04:32.188 --> 04:33.815
he did some talking,

04:33.898 --> 04:36.567
but if you didn't listen,
if you disobeyed,

04:36.651 --> 04:39.153
he'd put the crackdown on us.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.279
- He always told me,

04:40.363 --> 04:42.198
"I'ma make you better
than I was."

04:42.281 --> 04:43.491
- And my dad
would always tell us,

04:43.574 --> 04:45.284
"Y'all might hate my ways..."

04:45.368 --> 04:47.328
- "But you love my results."

04:47.412 --> 04:48.663
You ever heard that one?

04:48.746 --> 04:49.998
- The way I got a spankin',

04:50.081 --> 04:51.332
if you're looking
on the outside,

04:51.416 --> 04:53.459
you would bring up
the A word.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.502
But he would never come in

04:54.585 --> 04:56.713
and just knock me out
for no reason.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.923
I used to do
a lot of kid stuff.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.717
<i>Then a strange thing happens.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:02.552
As I'm starting
to figure things out

05:02.635 --> 05:04.887
and be more responsible
around the house,

05:04.971 --> 05:07.056
I realized
that my last name is different

05:07.140 --> 05:08.975
from my brother's and sisters'.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.894
So I said, "Mommy,
why is my name Shaquille O'Neal

05:11.978 --> 05:14.230
and Jamal, Lateefah,

05:14.313 --> 05:16.524

got married.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.323
He kept the name O'Neal
because it just sounded good.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.577
- And she said,

05:32.623 --> 05:34.709
What?

05:34.792 --> 05:37.295
<i>- I wanted to ensure</i>
<i>that he knew the truth.</i>

05:37.378 --> 05:40.298
And I introduced him
when he got to an age

05:40.381 --> 05:41.716
where he would understand,

05:41.799 --> 05:44.135
because I didn't want him
to hear that from anybody else.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.429
- She said, "Would you like
to meet your real father?"

05:46.512 --> 05:49.098
- "Yeah, I can get away
from this motherfucker now

05:49.182 --> 05:50.767
and go live with my other dad."

05:50.850 --> 05:54.145
<i>And we get in the car,</i>
<i>and guess where we end up at.</i>

05:54.228 --> 05:57.065
<i>The same projects</i>

05:57.148 --> 05:59.317

But I'm lookin' around like...

06:03.780 --> 06:05.573
"I'm not comin' back
to this shit."

06:05.656 --> 06:07.241
- He didn't care.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.785
[chuckles]

06:08.868 --> 06:10.244
He's like, "Okay."

06:10.328 --> 06:11.579

06:13.039 --> 06:15.249

06:24.550 --> 06:25.968
<i>I thought I was rich.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:27.011
<i>- Money was tight,</i>

06:27.095 --> 06:29.305
but the love
was overpowering the money,

06:29.388 --> 06:32.225
so we just all had this bond.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.810
- Our father had this motto,

06:33.893 --> 06:35.478
"If one jump in,

06:35.561 --> 06:36.938
we all jump in."

06:37.021 --> 06:39.440
<i>One time, this girl,</i>
<i>she hit me in the mouth.</i>

06:39.524 --> 06:42.193
And I ran and told my sister.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.946
- So I just immediately went
and hit her.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.281
Her sister came from the side
and blindsided me,

06:47.365 --> 06:49.075
so I fell on my back.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.203
So Shaquille grabbed the sister
by the collar,

06:52.286 --> 06:55.289
and he took Ayesha,
our younger sister's hand

06:55.373 --> 06:58.417
and started hitting her
upside the face.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.087
And then the brother
came down there--

07:01.170 --> 07:02.630
And this is when Shaquille--
he was, like,

07:02.713 --> 07:05.341
all into wrestling,
so he picked the brother up

07:05.424 --> 07:07.343
<i>and he did, like,</i>
<i>a backbreaker on him,</i>

07:07.426 --> 07:09.178
and the guy's all on the floor.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.888
And then the mom came,
and she's yelling.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.181
She's like, "Hey!"

07:12.265 --> 07:14.016
And then Shaquille's like,
"Oh, my God, we gotta go.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.268
Let's run."

07:15.351 --> 07:17.228
So he grabbed us all up,
and we took off running.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.938
And we get home, then...

"Yeah, your kids

07:25.111 --> 07:27.989
"Your son did some kind of move

07:28.072 --> 07:30.491
and now his back

07:30.575 --> 07:33.244
And my dad was like,
"Ooh, ooh, I'ma get y'all.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.287
Wait when they leave."

07:34.370 --> 07:36.164
My dad closed the door,
and he was like,

07:36.247 --> 07:39.000
"That's right.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.423
That's just the way it was.

he had to take care of us.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.594

07:49.677 --> 07:52.221
Never, "Okay, you do you."

16:07.132 --> 16:09.385
<i>And the base is even smaller.</i>

16:09.468 --> 16:12.221
And now I'm like, "Oh, my God."

16:12.304 --> 16:14.223
And I hate using this word
"depression."

16:14.306 --> 16:16.058
It was bad.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.060
But it was a blessing for me,

16:18.143 --> 16:19.853
'cause now there's
only one thing to do:

16:19.937 --> 16:22.189
play sports.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.774
<i>I go to the base every day.</i>

16:23.857 --> 16:25.526
<i>And there's no kids up there.</i>

16:25.609 --> 16:27.361
<i>I'm only there because</i>
<i>my father runs the gym</i>

16:27.444 --> 16:29.530
<i>and I'm not sitting</i>
<i>at the house all day.</i>

16:29.613 --> 16:31.907
"Get your ass out there
and play."

16:31.990 --> 16:34.368
So I play. I'm terrible.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.912
People criticizin' me.
I know it.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.164
My father comes in the house
one day.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.374
He hits me
in the back of the head

16:40.457 --> 16:42.918
with a paper.
[mimics whip cracking]

16:43.001 --> 16:46.130
Says, "College coach
comes to Wildflecken

16:46.213 --> 16:47.631
to speak to the troops."

16:47.715 --> 16:48.924
"Get your ass up.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.300
See if you can get
a scholarship."

16:50.384 --> 16:51.760
But before I left, I say,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.762
"I'm talkin'
to a college coach.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.097
Let me sound smart."

16:55.180 --> 16:57.182
So I...
<i>[pages fluttering]</i>

16:58.350 --> 16:59.768
<i>Extremities.</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:04.022
Extrem--extrem--extremities.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.900
<i>- All right, now, no punches</i>
<i>were thrown there.</i>

17:06.984 --> 17:08.861
<i>- Lookit, you see Dale Brown</i>
<i>push Groves?</i>

17:08.944 --> 17:09.903
<i>And then Gro--</i>

17:09.987 --> 17:10.946
<i>- It was really by accident</i>

17:11.029 --> 17:12.114
<i>when I first met him</i>

17:12.197 --> 17:13.615
<i>in a place called Wildflecken</i>

17:13.699 --> 17:14.783
<i>up in the mountains.</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:16.869
<i>I was at the gym where I was</i>
<i>putting on the clinic.</i>

17:16.952 --> 17:19.413
And I'm packing my bag, and I
get a tap on the shoulder.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.290
And I turn around, and...

17:21.373 --> 17:24.293
here's this giant of a guy,
kind of shy.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.461
"Coach Brown," he said,

17:25.544 --> 17:27.588
I'll be trying out
for the team."

17:27.671 --> 17:30.257
And he said,
"I can't dunk a ball.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.717
"And I run
up and down the court

17:31.800 --> 17:33.469
about three, four times..."

17:33.552 --> 17:34.970
both:
"And my lower extremities..."

17:35.053 --> 17:36.805
<i>- "Tire."</i>

17:36.889 --> 17:37.973
I say, "Lower extremities?"

17:38.057 --> 17:39.767
I didn't say that to him,
but I'm thinking,

17:39.850 --> 17:40.976
"He's a pretty smart guy."

17:41.059 --> 17:44.605
He said, "Can you show me
some exercises to improve it?"

17:44.688 --> 17:46.273
"What I'll do, Soldier,
when I get back to Baton Rouge

17:46.356 --> 17:47.608
is, I'll send you
the weight training program."

17:47.691 --> 17:49.610
I said, "How long
you been in service?"

17:49.693 --> 17:52.446
And he goes like this,
and he goes, "Coach Brown,

17:52.529 --> 17:54.990
I'm only 13 years old."

17:55.073 --> 17:56.450
I said, "What?"

17:56.533 --> 17:58.118
Being the Rhodes Scholar I am,

17:58.202 --> 18:01.580
my next question was,
"Where's your dad?"

18:01.663 --> 18:02.623
He said, "He's in the sauna."

18:02.706 --> 18:04.541
I said, "I'd like to meet him."

18:05.375 --> 18:06.835
<i>So we're heading to the sauna.</i>

18:06.919 --> 18:08.837
I was just putting my hand
on the door

18:08.921 --> 18:10.297
<i>and the door burst open.</i>

18:10.380 --> 18:12.633
And out, coming,
sweating profusely,

18:12.716 --> 18:14.343
military-green towel
around him--

18:14.426 --> 18:16.220
<i>"That's my dad.</i>
<i>That's my dad."</i>

18:16.303 --> 18:18.055
This is important.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.015
I handed him my business card,
and I said,

18:20.098 --> 18:22.559
"Sergeant Harrison,"
I said, "my name's Dale Brown.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.478
I'm the head basketball coach
at LSU."

18:24.561 --> 18:28.148
And almost with disdain,
"Excuse me, Coach Brown."

18:28.232 --> 18:30.859
He says, "This is all fine
and good, basketball."

18:30.943 --> 18:33.153
But he said,
"I think it's time,"

18:33.237 --> 18:35.489
he said,
"our children get degrees

18:35.572 --> 18:36.907
<i>"so they can be</i>
<i>generals in the army</i>

18:36.990 --> 18:38.200

<i>of corporations</i>

18:39.785 --> 18:40.994
<i>"instead of janitors.</i>

18:41.078 --> 18:43.664
<i>"They can be head coaches</i>
<i>instead of assistant coaches</i>

18:43.747 --> 18:45.582
"running all over the country

18:45.666 --> 18:47.835
"If you're interested

18:47.918 --> 18:49.628
we might talk someday."

18:49.711 --> 18:51.213
<i>- Sends me the program.</i>

18:51.296 --> 18:52.881
So I try everything.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.050
And I try out
for the team again,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.260
but I don't make it.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.387
So I write him
a tearful letter.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.057
"Coach, I'm sorry.
It didn't work."

19:02.140 --> 19:03.183
- "I did everything..."

19:03.267 --> 19:04.560
- "Thank you for the help."
<i>- "You told me to do..."</i>

19:04.643 --> 19:05.686
- "I appreciate it."
<i>- "And my high school coach</i>

19:05.769 --> 19:07.271
"cut me off the team.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.023
"He told me I'm too slow,

"I have too big of feet.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.735
"I will never be
a basketball player.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.571
Why don't I be a goalie
in soccer?"

19:15.654 --> 19:17.364
So I sat behind my desk
and I thought,

19:17.447 --> 19:19.867
"Now, what kind
of a profound statement

19:19.950 --> 19:22.703
am I gonna make
to a 13-year-old child?"

19:22.786 --> 19:23.871
"Dear Shaquille,

19:23.954 --> 19:25.706
"I'm so sorry
what happened to you.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.959

He won't be successful,'

19:35.007 --> 19:39.303
"if you always sincerely
try to do your very best--

19:39.386 --> 19:43.056
"and only you will know that--

19:43.140 --> 19:44.933
"under any conditions,

19:45.017 --> 19:48.604
sooner or later, God'll take
care of everything else."

19:48.687 --> 19:51.523
- That's why I wanted to go
to LSU.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.903
Because before I became
this character known as "Shaq,"

19:55.986 --> 19:57.321
nobody wanted me.

19:57.404 --> 20:01.033
But Dale Brown looked at me.
He chose me.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.576
<i>He put his hand</i>
<i>around my shoulders</i>

20:02.659 --> 20:05.287

20:07.414 --> 20:09.416

20:15.047 --> 20:17.299
And he said,
"Coach, I want to try out

20:17.382 --> 20:18.342
for the basketball team."

20:18.425 --> 20:20.761
He said,
"If you promise not to cut me,

20:20.844 --> 20:23.013
I promise you won't regret it."

20:23.096 --> 20:25.933
And I said, "Okay, we'll see

<i>Man, I tell you what,</i>

20:38.862 --> 20:40.989

20:41.073 --> 20:43.408
<i>He was so hard on Shaquille.</i>
<i>He was so--</i>

20:43.492 --> 20:45.118
<i>I think there were times</i>
<i>Shaquille was afraid of him</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:46.620
<i>and rightfully so.</i>

20:46.703 --> 20:47.996
I'm not a parent.
I don't have kids.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.957
It's not my place to say

20:50.040 --> 20:52.292
whether it was too hard
or too soft or--

20:52.376 --> 20:54.795
I think the results
speak for themselves.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.838
Let's just say this,

20:56.922 --> 20:59.216
Sarge had one speed: 11.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.511
<i>When I first started with him,</i>

21:02.594 --> 21:05.180
<i>Shaquille's brain and his body</i>

21:05.263 --> 21:07.307
<i>is still catching up</i>
<i>with his size.</i>

21:07.391 --> 21:09.518
And there were times
when he would run

21:09.601 --> 21:12.396
and his bones were going faster
than his muscles.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.523
And he--it was very painful
for him to run.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.192
And sometimes we'd run
conditioning drills.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.194
He would cry.
[indistinct yelling]

21:19.278 --> 21:21.989
<i>- I had something</i>
<i>called Osgood-Schlatter's.</i>

21:22.072 --> 21:23.031
<i>I was growing too fast,</i>

21:23.115 --> 21:25.534
<i>and my body and my knees</i>
<i>didn't keep up.</i>

21:25.617 --> 21:26.827
<i>- And I'd pull him aside</i>
<i>and say,</i>

21:26.910 --> 21:28.286
<i>"Hey, why don't you sit</i>
<i>this one out?"</i>

21:28.370 --> 21:29.371
<i>He said, "No, Coach.</i>

21:29.454 --> 21:31.623
I'll do what everybody else
does."

21:31.707 --> 21:34.084
<i>As a sophomore</i>
<i>playing on a team</i>

21:34.167 --> 21:36.962
<i>laden with seniors</i>
<i>and a couple of juniors,</i>

21:37.045 --> 21:39.381
he kind of got picked on
a little bit.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.216
We were in a game
up in Osterholz,

21:41.299 --> 21:43.343
which is way up
in northern Germany.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.053
He was open inside,

21:45.137 --> 21:46.763
and they were taking shots

21:46.847 --> 21:48.974
rather than kicking it down
inside to him.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.267
So I told them at halftime,

21:50.350 --> 21:52.394
"If you guys don't start
getting the ball inside to him,

21:52.477 --> 21:55.564
I'ma pull both you guys out
and you're gonna sit."

21:55.647 --> 21:58.984
I think that one of the things
that he appreciates

21:59.067 --> 22:00.527
is that I stood up for him.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.031
<i>Playing high school ball</i>
<i>in Europe,</i>

22:04.114 --> 22:09.286
<i>our average road trip was</i>
<i>between four and five hours.</i>

<i>When I think</i>
<i>about the relationship</i>

22:10.954 --> 22:12.539
<i>that I've had with Shaquille,</i>

22:12.622 --> 22:16.376
<i>it was all forged</i>
<i>on a bus to nowhere</i>

22:16.460 --> 22:19.129
<i>and talking</i>
<i>about what young kids</i>

22:19.212 --> 22:21.465
<i>hoped for and dreamed for,</i>

22:21.548 --> 22:25.635
and, "How come our moms
and dads are so strict on us?"

22:25.719 --> 22:28.263
I was fortunate to be able,
maybe, to give him

22:28.346 --> 22:31.266
some perspective, you know,
during that time in his life

22:31.349 --> 22:33.935
when he was kind of forming
his own opinion

22:34.019 --> 22:36.605
about what he thought
about the world.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.898
<i>So at the end of the year,</i>

22:37.981 --> 22:41.026
<i>we made it to</i>
<i>the small schools tournament.</i>

22:41.109 --> 22:43.528
Unfortunately,
Shaquille's father,

22:43.612 --> 22:47.908
he was destined to be
transferred back to the States.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.077
So we got a call
that he was gonna be leaving.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.453
We looked at the calendar.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.580
We're not gonna have him
for the Elite Eight.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.915
He played
in those last two games.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.042
He played lights out.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.835
We're done,
we're in the locker room,

22:58.919 --> 23:00.504
I'm talking to the team,

23:00.587 --> 23:03.465
<i>and Shaquille was leaning</i>
<i>over the counter to the sinks.</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:05.300
And I noticed the sinks
were wet, and I thought,

23:05.384 --> 23:06.635
"Why is he washing his hands?

23:06.718 --> 23:08.470
"We--I mean, I guess
we just played a game.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.846
I don't know."

23:09.930 --> 23:13.141
And I quickly realized
that it wasn't water.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.352
He was crying.

23:15.435 --> 23:19.314
And I knew in that moment

23:19.397 --> 23:22.150
how difficult
it was gonna be--

23:22.234 --> 23:23.443
[clears throat]

23:23.527 --> 23:24.736
I knew how difficult
it was gonna be

23:24.820 --> 23:26.446
for him to leave us.

23:26.530 --> 23:31.284
And he turned to me,
and he hugged me.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.662
And he said,
"Coach, I love you."

23:33.745 --> 23:35.705
And I said,
"I love you too, big guy."

23:36.206 --> 23:37.874
<i>That's the last time I saw him</i>

23:37.958 --> 23:40.627
<i>until he was playing</i>
<i>for Coach Brown.</i>

23:41.753 --> 23:44.131
<i>- After my sophomore year,</i>
<i>we leave.</i>

23:44.214 --> 23:46.675
Back in Jersey
and seeing family--

23:46.758 --> 23:49.052
"What's happening?" Boom, boom.
Lovin' and huggin'.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.804
We got the moving thing
on top of the car.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.347
I'm like,
"Yo, man, where we going?"

23:52.430 --> 23:54.182
"Shut your ass up
and get in the car."

23:54.266 --> 23:55.183
And we get in the car.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.270
<i>And we drivin' and we drivin'.</i>

23:58.353 --> 24:00.772
Now I'm starting to see stuff
I ain't seen in a while--cows.

24:00.856 --> 24:01.940
I'm like...

24:02.023 --> 24:04.526
<i>And then I see,</i>
<i>"Welcome to Texas."</i>

24:04.609 --> 24:06.820
I'm like, "Texas?"

24:06.903 --> 24:09.489
Cowboys?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.992
<i>We moved</i>
<i>to San Antonio, Texas.</i>

31:45.903 --> 31:47.280
"I don't give a shit
what you say.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.781
"I don't care how much money
they're offering you.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.116
You ain't doing nothing."

31:50.199 --> 31:52.785
- If he goes the NBA and can't
do what they expect him to do,

31:52.869 --> 31:53.953
where's he gonna be at?

31:54.037 --> 31:56.205
- I go--I said,
"I want to go pro."

31:56.289 --> 31:57.498
He's going, "Motherfucker,

31:57.582 --> 31:58.708
"da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.001
Get out of my face!"

32:00.084 --> 32:02.170
So my mom said,
"Come with me, baby."

32:02.253 --> 32:04.756
And my mom said,
"Balance this checkbook."

32:04.839 --> 32:07.175
I didn't know
what the fuck I was doing.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.676
Mom said,
"You not ready, baby."

32:08.760 --> 32:10.553
- He decided that he wanted
to go back to school

32:10.637 --> 32:12.597
for at least another year
or so.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.391
- "This conversation over."
"Yes, ma'am."

32:17.143 --> 32:19.020
- At that time,
I made it my point

32:19.103 --> 32:20.021
just to help him.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.981
If he needed me, I was there.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.984
<i>He had that dream, "I'm gonna</i>
<i>be professional one day."</i>

32:25.068 --> 32:28.488
We would not pay bills
and get in the car on a Friday

32:28.571 --> 32:31.032
and drive to Louisiana

32:31.115 --> 32:32.659
just to spend
the weekend with him

32:32.742 --> 32:36.496
so that we could be with him
and keep him encouraged.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.831
<i>"You a big man.</i>
<i>You stand tall.</i>

32:38.915 --> 32:40.333
You don't let

32:40.416 --> 32:42.710
<i>- And it's a 10-point lead.</i>

32:42.794 --> 32:45.046
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

32:45.129 --> 32:47.423
<i>One-handed catch by Shaquille.</i>

32:47.507 --> 32:48.591
<i>Got his own rebound.</i>

32:48.675 --> 32:50.218
<i>And that'll count.</i>

32:50.301 --> 32:52.970
<i>And a foul as O'Neal will step</i>
<i>to the free throw line.</i>

32:53.054 --> 32:54.722
<i>- People had to compete</i>
<i>against me</i>

32:54.806 --> 32:56.474
<i>because of my size.</i>

32:56.557 --> 32:58.559
<i>They felt they had to get</i>
<i>super physical.</i>

32:58.643 --> 33:01.270
<i>Well, guess what.</i>
<i>I got ass-whuppings every day.</i>

33:01.354 --> 33:02.438
<i>You're not hurting me.</i>

33:02.522 --> 33:03.690
<i>It's just making me</i>
<i>more angry.</i>

33:03.773 --> 33:05.191
[whistle blows]
<i>- And a foul.</i>

33:05.274 --> 33:07.026
<i>- Oh! How good is that?</i>

33:07.110 --> 33:09.362
<i>- Also showed me</i>
<i>a sign of respect.</i>

33:09.445 --> 33:11.406
<i>"I can't stop you, man.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I fouled him."</i>

33:11.489 --> 33:13.074
<i>- You think</i>
<i>this big guy is good?</i>

33:13.157 --> 33:15.368
<i>Watch this. He's gonna</i>
<i>get hammered right here,</i>

33:15.451 --> 33:18.705
<i>get fouled, still get it up</i>
<i>with his strength, get it in,</i>

33:18.788 --> 33:19.914
<i>and count it.</i>

33:19.997 --> 33:22.667
<i>- I had called the SCC</i>
<i>numerous times and told them</i>

33:22.750 --> 33:25.837
<i>that the referees have to stop</i>
<i>these flagrant fouls.</i>

33:25.920 --> 33:27.755
<i>- Tapped in...</i>
<i>- "They can't stop him,</i>

33:27.839 --> 33:28.756
<i>"so they foul him,</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:30.425

33:34.053 --> 33:35.263
<i>- They're gonna get shots.</i>
[whistle blows]

33:35.346 --> 33:37.557
<i>O'Neal is fouled by Groves</i>
<i>as he made</i>

33:37.640 --> 33:39.642
<i>a strong move to the basket.</i>

33:39.726 --> 33:41.310
<i>Strong being a bit</i>
<i>of an understatement</i>

33:41.394 --> 33:42.562
<i>in that case.</i>

33:42.645 --> 33:44.647
<i>- When we go</i>

33:44.731 --> 33:45.898
<i>third time this happened</i>

33:45.982 --> 33:47.191
<i>by this player</i>
<i>from Tennessee.</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:48.276
<i>- Won four in a row,</i>

33:48.359 --> 33:50.194
[whistle blows]

33:50.278 --> 33:51.904
<i>Uh-oh, look out.</i>

33:51.988 --> 33:53.573
<i>Groves and O'Neal square off.</i>

33:53.656 --> 33:55.575
<i>And Dale Brown</i>
<i>is pushing Groves.</i>

33:55.658 --> 33:57.243
<i>- And I see Shaquille's knee</i>
<i>going out</i>

33:57.326 --> 33:58.745
<i>and a fight breaking out,</i>

33:58.828 --> 34:00.079
<i>so I go out on the court</i>

34:00.163 --> 34:03.082
<i>and get in a confrontation</i>
<i>with the guy doing it.</i>

34:03.166 --> 34:05.126
- That's why I love that man.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.170
<i>He was right there next to me.</i>

34:07.754 --> 34:09.422
<i>The reason why I swung</i>
<i>on Carlus Groves,</i>

34:09.505 --> 34:10.631

34:10.715 --> 34:12.800
<i>this dude's trying</i>
<i>to mess my money up.</i>

34:12.884 --> 34:14.635
<i>And I wanted to send a message</i>

34:14.719 --> 34:16.012
<i>that try to mess my money up,</i>

34:16.095 --> 34:18.306
<i>this is what's gonna happen</i>
<i>to you.</i>

34:18.389 --> 34:20.391
<i>- Sadly as I hate to say this,</i>

34:20.475 --> 34:22.351
<i>I'm recommending</i>
<i>to Shaquille's parents</i>

34:22.435 --> 34:23.811
that he turns NBA.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.855
I do not want to see
this young man

34:25.938 --> 34:28.107
blatantly fouled and hurt

34:28.191 --> 34:31.486
and then, because
of my selfishness to win,

34:31.569 --> 34:32.862
he doesn't play pro ball.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.113
If he's going to get hurt

34:34.197 --> 34:35.656
and people are going
to intentionally foul him

34:35.740 --> 34:37.617
for the 18th time,

34:37.700 --> 34:39.410
<i>he needs to go get money</i>
<i>to get hurt.</i>

34:39.494 --> 34:41.454
<i>- He's no ordinary</i>
<i>19-year-old.</i>

34:41.537 --> 34:45.666
<i>Standing 7'1"</i>
<i>and weighing in at 285 pounds,</i>

34:45.750 --> 34:48.294
<i>his amazing speed</i>
<i>and spectacular skills</i>

34:48.377 --> 34:51.005
<i>have made him, without doubt,</i>

34:51.088 --> 34:53.424
<i>collegiate basketball player</i>
<i>in the nation.</i>

34:53.508 --> 34:55.593
<i>- Junior year. Dominated.</i>

34:55.676 --> 34:57.428
<i>Dick Vitale's still screaming</i>
<i>my name.</i>

34:57.512 --> 34:58.846
<i>- Shaquille O'Neal!</i>

34:58.930 --> 35:00.223
- Go home, same argument.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.016
But it's the first time
I stand up to him.

35:02.099 --> 35:03.768
"Man, fuck that.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.521
They fuckin' me up in school.
I'm going."

35:06.604 --> 35:07.563
<i>And it was the first time</i>

35:07.647 --> 35:08.940
<i>he looked back at me</i>
<i>and was like--</i>

35:09.023 --> 35:11.150
<i>he realized</i>
<i>that he created a man.</i>

35:11.234 --> 35:13.152
And then Mom says, "You know
what I'm gonna ask you to do.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.654
Pull it out."

35:14.737 --> 35:15.696
My shit was neat.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.950
Debits, credits, boom, boom,
bada-bam, bada-bing.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.409
And she said,
"Okay, you ready."

35:30.586 --> 35:32.880
<i>- When you have a dream</i>
<i>come alive,</i>

35:32.964 --> 35:36.175
<i>it's just a blessing</i>
<i>instead of hard work.</i>

35:38.302 --> 35:40.596
<i>He told me I was never</i>
<i>gonna have to worry.</i>

35:40.680 --> 35:41.931
<i>"You won't have to worry</i>
<i>about anything.</i>

35:42.014 --> 35:43.558
<i>You gonna be able to get</i>
<i>anything that you want."</i>

35:43.641 --> 35:46.018
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"Okay, okay. That's fine."</i>

35:46.853 --> 35:49.355
It's good.
It's good for all of us.

35:49.438 --> 35:51.023
<i>- Good afternoon.</i>
<i>The mic's on?</i>

35:51.107 --> 35:52.525
[tapping]

35:53.276 --> 35:55.444
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for coming.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.363
About to make my statement.

35:57.446 --> 35:59.866
I, Shaquille O'Neal,
after careful deliberation,

35:59.949 --> 36:02.910
have decided to forgo
my senior year eligibility

36:02.994 --> 36:04.161
at LSU.

36:04.245 --> 36:07.123
I'm not making this decision
out of anger or frustration.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.375
I feel that in my heart,
it's time for a change

36:09.458 --> 36:11.711
and it's time
for me to move on.

36:11.794 --> 36:14.046
I've truly enjoyed every aspect
of my college years

36:14.130 --> 36:17.008
as a basketball player
and as a student.

36:17.091 --> 36:19.468
I think the experience
was very much needed.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.387
But now I am ready to take
what I've learned

36:21.470 --> 36:22.930
on with me to the NBA.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.266
And I'd like to thank
you people for coming

36:25.349 --> 36:26.976
and thank you for the awards,

36:27.059 --> 36:28.311
and, you know, thank you
for everything.

36:28.394 --> 36:31.230
And thank you for listening.
Peace.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.065
Any questions?

36:34.483 --> 36:36.402
<i>- Always been our dream</i>
<i>to see him play in the NBA.</i>

36:36.485 --> 36:38.946
<i>My dream, you know.</i>

36:39.030 --> 36:39.947
Because I wanted to play,

36:40.031 --> 36:41.073
that's what he playin' in.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.575
Now my son is gonna play in it.

36:42.658 --> 36:44.076
It makes me feel
a whole lot better

36:44.160 --> 36:47.079

to go farther than what I went,

36:47.163 --> 36:48.456

36:48.539 --> 36:49.749
That's the main--

36:49.832 --> 36:51.250
you know what I mean,
your children going farther

36:57.715 --> 36:58.966
<i>- I was elated for the family,</i>

37:02.053 --> 37:04.805

37:16.567 --> 37:18.569
<i>- We're going to work.</i>
<i>- Time to go to work, huh?</i>

37:20.196 --> 37:21.280

<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>My mother was there.</i>

37:31.374 --> 37:33.834

39:41.378 --> 39:42.630

39:42.713 --> 39:44.131
<i>"Well, he doesn't have</i>
<i>a free throw,"</i>

39:44.215 --> 39:45.466
or, "He doesn't shoot three."

39:45.549 --> 39:46.801

39:46.884 --> 39:49.970
<i>Let the locomotive</i>

39:53.349 --> 39:55.768
<i>And I think</i>
<i>that's the presence</i>

39:55.851 --> 39:58.979
Shaq brought into the NBA
as a rookie.

39:59.438 --> 40:02.108
<i>- So when you lookin'</i>
<i>at a god on TV</i>

40:02.191 --> 40:03.567
but then when you see him
in real life

40:03.651 --> 40:05.945
<i>and you realize</i>
<i>he's not a god,</i>

40:06.028 --> 40:08.239
now that so-called god
is in trouble.

40:09.865 --> 40:12.701
<i>- Shaq for two</i>
<i>over Olajuwon.</i>

40:12.785 --> 40:15.287
<i>- Sets up O'Neal. Oh, my.</i>

40:15.371 --> 40:18.749
<i>And then lets the crowd know,</i>
<i>"I'm here."</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:21.585
- The first time Patrick Ewing
shot a fadeaway jump shot

40:21.669 --> 40:22.795
and I'm right there.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.006
<i>- Ewing.</i>
- Ooh.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.842
I think I can block that.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.802
So now next time,
should get a little closer

40:29.885 --> 40:31.262
when he get on that fadeaway.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.514
<i>My father said,</i>

40:41.605 --> 40:42.731
- Yes, sir.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.817
<i>- Boy, that--when does that</i>

40:44.900 --> 40:46.360
<i>Maybe--I don't remember.</i>

40:46.443 --> 40:47.987
- Uh-oh.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.739
Your ass is in trouble.

40:50.823 --> 40:51.740
- We're gonna just stand up

40:51.824 --> 40:52.825

- Okay.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.160
- Standing up.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.327
So does your mic--

40:55.411 --> 40:56.829
I don't think
your mic does that--

40:56.912 --> 40:58.539

41:01.041 --> 41:02.293
Okay.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.171

41:05.254 --> 41:06.463
But first...

41:07.464 --> 41:09.383

- Oh, I forgot.

41:09.466 --> 41:12.720
- Come here, come here.
[whispering indistinctly]

41:12.803 --> 41:15.222
- Yeah. Sorry.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.851
- Go ahead.
- This is "Today" on NBC.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.812
One of my superpowers is,
I can stop time.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.356
And what I mean by that is,
I can foresee stuff

41:24.440 --> 41:25.858
before it happens.

41:25.941 --> 41:28.068
So I had a professor,
Tommy Karam.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.236
He pulled me to the side
and said,

41:29.320 --> 41:31.363
"Why you don't never
want to speak up in the class?"

41:31.447 --> 41:34.200
"'Cause when I g-g-et nervous,
I stutter."

41:34.283 --> 41:36.327
Profess-professional athlete.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.162
[stuttering]

41:38.245 --> 41:40.539
So then we used to set up

41:40.623 --> 41:42.583
<i>He used to come in</i>
<i>with a little VHS camera,</i>

41:42.666 --> 41:44.043

41:44.126 --> 41:45.753
and then we'd stop
and go over it.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.796
So now I'm practicing at home

55:16.312 --> 55:18.023
Is he gettin' a contract?

55:18.106 --> 55:20.233
Everything changed.

55:21.901 --> 55:23.028
[buzzer blares]

55:23.111 --> 55:25.196
<i>- A look</i>
<i>at the starting lineups.</i>

55:25.280 --> 55:28.241
<i>The Magic will start</i>
<i>without Shaquille O'Neal.</i>

55:28.324 --> 55:31.286
<i>- Well, in 1996,</i>
<i>my grandmother died.</i>

55:31.369 --> 55:33.038
After the funeral,
I just needed a couple days

55:33.121 --> 55:34.914
to just relax.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.541
But they callin' me,
"We're playin' the Bulls.

55:36.624 --> 55:38.752
Come, come, come."
Like, "No, I'm not comin'."

55:38.835 --> 55:42.297
That's more important to them
than my family.

55:42.380 --> 55:43.923
A damn game.

55:44.007 --> 55:47.093
<i>- Here comes Shaquille O'Neal.</i>

55:47.177 --> 55:48.928
<i>With a sense of drama,</i>

55:49.012 --> 55:52.474
<i>Shaquille O'Neal just arrived</i>
<i>at the arena.</i>

55:52.557 --> 55:55.769
<i>He is hustling back</i>
<i>to the Orlando locker room</i>

55:55.852 --> 55:58.938
<i>and, obviously, will try</i>
<i>to get himself into uniform</i>

55:59.022 --> 56:01.066
<i>and will be appearing</i>
<i>on the bench.</i>

56:01.149 --> 56:04.819
<i>- So I come in the middle.</i>
<i>We lose.</i>

56:04.903 --> 56:06.946
<i>And I do something</i>
<i>I wasn't supposed to do.</i>

56:07.030 --> 56:09.157
<i>I go upstairs and say,</i>

56:09.240 --> 56:11.701
<i>"We startin' off</i>
<i>at $115 million."</i>

56:11.785 --> 56:14.579
They, whoever they may be,
did a poll.

56:14.662 --> 56:17.415
<i>"Is Shaq worth $115 million?"</i>

56:17.499 --> 56:19.250
<i>And the town said no.</i>

56:19.334 --> 56:20.627
<i>- Well, I just think</i>
<i>if Shaq is as good</i>

56:20.710 --> 56:22.504
<i>as he thinks he is,</i>
<i>why do they ever have</i>

56:22.587 --> 56:24.464
<i>25, 30 rebounds in a game?</i>

56:24.547 --> 56:26.382
<i>Why didn't he step up</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter?</i>

56:26.466 --> 56:27.967
<i>You know, he was...</i>
<i>- Shaquille O'Neal,</i>

56:28.051 --> 56:30.804
<i>who's already a millionaire</i>
<i>and has a mansion,</i>

56:30.887 --> 56:32.430
<i>how much more does he need?</i>

56:32.514 --> 56:34.557
- How dare you ask
the community

56:34.641 --> 56:35.809
should he be paid that much?

56:35.892 --> 56:36.935
You know better.

56:37.018 --> 56:38.144
Or maybe you don't.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.105
<i>- I just think that the man</i>
<i>didn't want to play</i>

56:40.188 --> 56:42.065
<i>for the Magic anymore</i>
<i>because he wasn't</i>

56:42.148 --> 56:45.110
<i>the main man anymore</i>
<i>because we got Penny.</i>

56:45.193 --> 56:47.779
- It reminded me of Snoop Dogg
at the Source Awards.

56:47.862 --> 56:49.948
- The East Coast don't love
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg?

56:50.031 --> 56:52.784
- Orlando Magic, y'all
don't love Shaquille O'Neal?

56:52.867 --> 56:54.119
- Y'all don't love us?
- Y'all don't love me?

56:54.202 --> 56:56.830
<i>- Shaq wanted to stay</i>
<i>with the Orlando Magic.</i>

56:56.913 --> 56:58.414
<i>He was a small-town guy.</i>

56:58.498 --> 56:59.874
Instead of offering

56:59.958 --> 57:03.670
the most dominant player
in basketball a max deal,

57:03.753 --> 57:07.090
they started playing around
trying to negotiate with him.

57:07.173 --> 57:10.844
It really made him feel
disrespected.

57:10.927 --> 57:13.847
- There's no loyalty
in any game.

57:13.930 --> 57:16.516
So get a call from my guy.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.351
He said, "They offered you
$80 million for four.

57:18.434 --> 57:21.020
I'm like, "That's cool.
I could take that."

57:21.104 --> 57:24.065
Basketball gods or something
said, "Don't do it."

57:26.609 --> 57:27.777
- How much he get?

57:29.362 --> 57:30.321
- Congratulations, Zo.

57:30.405 --> 57:32.490
<i>Man, I'm just, you know,</i>
<i>hoping to get</i>

57:32.574 --> 57:33.825
<i>a pretty good deal.</i>

57:33.908 --> 57:37.579
<i>The Miami Heat signed Juwan</i>
<i>for $110 million</i>

57:37.662 --> 57:39.914
<i>and Alonzo for $115 million.</i>

57:39.998 --> 57:42.667
And I'm like,
"I done killed both of them

57:42.750 --> 57:44.210
<i>their whole career."</i>

57:44.294 --> 57:45.670
<i>- Oh! Oh, what a dunk.</i>

57:45.753 --> 57:48.798
- If a top-of-the-line BMW
costs $110 million,

57:48.882 --> 57:50.884
what does a top-of-the-line
Mercedes cost?

57:50.967 --> 57:52.385
Much more.

57:52.468 --> 57:54.554
<i>So then we're in the Olympics.</i>
<i>We're trainin'.</i>

57:54.637 --> 57:56.347
Uncle Jerome and I were out--

57:56.431 --> 57:58.183
at a gentleman's club,
I may add.

57:58.266 --> 58:00.977
- I remember he got a call
from his agent at the time

58:01.060 --> 58:02.228
that we had to meet him.

58:02.312 --> 58:04.022
It was, like,
early in the morning.

58:04.105 --> 58:05.565
When we get there,

58:05.648 --> 58:08.401
<i>his agent is there</i>
<i>and Mr. West is there.</i>

58:08.484 --> 58:10.069
- And then he was like,
"Jerry, tell him."

58:10.153 --> 58:12.947
And Jerry says,
"We got some good news

58:13.031 --> 58:14.073
and I got some bad news."

58:14.157 --> 58:15.408
And I said,
"What's the bad news?"

58:15.491 --> 58:17.410
He said, "I can't get you
that $115 million."

58:17.493 --> 58:18.536
I said,
"What's the good news?"

58:18.620 --> 58:20.413
"I can get you
to $120 million."

58:20.496 --> 58:21.581
I was like...

58:21.664 --> 58:24.209
- As a basketball player,
I cried.

58:24.292 --> 58:27.754
<i>Shaq on the floor</i>
<i>makes life easier</i>

58:27.837 --> 58:30.173
<i>because he's that dominant.</i>

58:30.256 --> 58:31.925
- I didn't know
that he was leaving Orlando

58:32.008 --> 58:35.553
until I saw
the actual press conference

58:35.637 --> 58:37.430
<i>with him holding</i>
<i>a Laker jersey</i>

58:37.513 --> 58:39.015
<i>with Jerry West.</i>

58:39.098 --> 58:40.808
- Didn't communicate at all.

58:40.892 --> 58:43.144
Not one time
did we call each other

58:43.228 --> 58:45.605
<i>and talk to each other</i>
<i>and talk it out.</i>

58:45.688 --> 58:47.106
<i>- Penny didn't even know.</i>

58:47.190 --> 58:49.359
But all I really wanted
was for Penny to go

58:49.442 --> 58:51.402
to the Orlando and say,
"Pay Shaq.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.071
<i>"Shaq stuck up for me.</i>
<i>Now I'm stickin' up for him.</i>

58:53.154 --> 58:55.031
Pay him."
But he never did that.

58:55.114 --> 58:58.076
So in my mind, I was like,
"Okay, you want to be the man?

58:58.159 --> 58:59.327
There you go."

58:59.410 --> 59:01.246
<i>In case you haven't</i>
<i>figured it out yet,</i>

59:01.329 --> 59:03.456
<i>I've signed</i>
<i>with the Los Angeles Lakers.</i>

59:03.539 --> 59:06.084
<i>Keep in mind</i>
<i>the word "change."</i>

59:06.167 --> 59:08.461
To me, change is for the good.

59:08.544 --> 59:11.631
And right when I'm signin',
Jerry West says to me,

59:11.714 --> 59:13.466
<i>"In a couple years,</i>
<i>you're gonna be</i>

59:13.549 --> 59:15.176
<i>"one of the best</i>
<i>basketball players</i>

59:15.260 --> 59:16.928
<i>ever to play the game."</i>

59:17.011 --> 59:19.055
Pause. I was like,
"You know what?

59:19.138 --> 59:20.640
You might be right."

59:20.723 --> 59:22.684
[gears rumbling]

1:00:52.774 --> 1:00:55.318
[bright tone]
