<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:04.921 --> 00:07.716
- Seriously, Mom, can we cool
it with the college talk.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.384
Can't you just give me time
to make my own decisions

00:09.426 --> 00:10.760
about my own life.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.679
- No, Georgie because time
is up.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.681
- You know, now we're
all sitting around here

00:14.723 --> 00:16.474
I think it's a great time
to talk about business.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.435
- I'm game as long as
it has noting to do

00:18.476 --> 00:20.311
with expanding the herd.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.479
- There is an injured horse
out there!

00:21.521 --> 00:23.356
- Which one?
- Shooting Star.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.025
- She seemed fine
in the paddock.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.568
<i>Ty: She has a stress fracture</i>

00:26.609 --> 00:28.028

How is our Shooting Star?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.816
Amy: Well, she feels really
smooth.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.110
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.862
And Ty says that her scan
looks good.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.906
So are you gonna put her back
on the track?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.117
- I actually have something
else in mind for her.

01:57.158 --> 02:01.079
I want to expand the stable
to include hunter/jumpers.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.748
Do you think that she could
make that transition?

02:03.790 --> 02:06.001
- Yeah. It's possible.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.919
It all depends on her
temperament

02:07.961 --> 02:09.628
and her ability to jump
of course.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.297
- Of course.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.882
Uh, I wanna give it a shot.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.718
Would you...

02:14.759 --> 02:16.928
would you be game
to retrain her?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.388
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Yeah?

02:18.430 --> 02:20.348
- Yeah.
- When?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.600
- Uh... I could start right now.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.436
Lyndy's with Lou,

02:24.477 --> 02:26.646
and Ty is volunteering
at Luke's nature camp.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.690
- Aww. Okay.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.359
Well, go for it.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.902
Gosh, I wish I could stay
and watch that

02:32.944 --> 02:34.904
I've gotta go and show a stud
horse to big wig

02:34.946 --> 02:36.698
from Wellington, Florida.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.491
- Oh, Wellington.
- Yeah, Yeah.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.785
He owns a complex the size
of Spruce Meadows.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.203
- Oh well, good luck.
- Thank you.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.457
- Okay. Looks like they want
all the parents

02:45.498 --> 02:47.334
to meet in Hudson park

02:47.375 --> 02:49.377
30 minutes before the ceremony.

02:50.962 --> 02:51.921
- I can't believe
she's graduating.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.757
- I know.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.925
It feels like just yesterday
we adopted Georgie.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.553
- Best decision we ever made.
- Hm.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.307
- What an adventure, huh?
- Yeah, the trick riding...

03:02.349 --> 03:03.933
- Showjumping...

03:03.975 --> 03:05.602
- Running away to your place
in Vancouver

03:05.643 --> 03:06.811
without telling us.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.064
- (Laughs) Teenage years, huh?

03:09.105 --> 03:10.732
- Soon we get to go through it
all over again with Katie.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.860
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hi.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.697
- I was just about
to shove off.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.491
- Hey, you know what?
Why don't you just stay here?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.826
Luke's room is empty.
- Yeah?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.579
- Yeah. No worries.
- Oh, amazing. Thanks.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.791
- How are you?
- Just really good.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.334
Really good.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.004
- I'm so sorry
I've been so busy.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.340
- Oh, hey, your daughter is
about to graduate high school.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.675
I get it.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.718
- Why don't I make it up to you.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.886
Let's go out for dinner
tomorrow night,

03:39.928 --> 03:41.763
just the two of us.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.432
- Hmm. Also, we might have
something else to celebrate.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.017
- Oh yeah?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.727
- Yes, there's a herd
of grade-A,

03:47.769 --> 03:49.688
grass-fed cow for sale.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.439
It's exactly what we need
to sell Garland more beef.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.733
- That is great.
- Mhmm.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.860
- But you still have
the same problem?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.655
- Yeah. Jack.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.657
But it's okay. I'm working on
my sales pitch

04:00.699 --> 04:02.075
- Good.
- Yeah.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.952
I'm just gonna say listen--

04:03.993 --> 04:06.454
- There you are!
- Jack.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.670
- Why are you looking at me
like that?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.755
- I-I-I realized that I was,

04:15.797 --> 04:17.298
I was supposed to meet up
with you.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.801
- That's right. We need your
help in the field.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.636
So let's get at it.
- You bet.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.350
I'm gonna do it...
I'll do it later.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.195

04:39.237 --> 04:40.905
Oh. Oh, sorry,
I thought you were--

04:40.947 --> 04:42.824
- Older.
Yeah, he definitely is.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.993
My dad, Clyde.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.745
But he couldn't make it
so you're stuck with me.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.121
- Ah.
- I'm Quinn.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.748
- Well, it's nice to meet you,
Quinn.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.291
- Don't worry.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.917
I got my dad's blessing
to buy this stud,

04:52.959 --> 04:55.170
and I gotta say,
I like what I see -

04:55.211 --> 04:57.922
deep chest, lean body,
nice long flat muscles.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.342
It's everything we look for
in a sire.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.968
- Thank you for coming all this
way to see him.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.971
- No problem. Truth is,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.474
is I got some other business
to attend to anyway so.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.601
- Here in Hudson? Really?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.186
Are you-are you looking to buy
horses from someone else?

05:11.227 --> 05:12.854
- No. Nothing like that.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.984
There is this girl...

05:18.026 --> 05:20.362
and uh, I'm kinda hoping
we can get reacquainted.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.074
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you.

your valedictorian speech?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.124
- Yeah. He's totally obsessed.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.625
- Every time I think I'm done,

06:15.667 --> 06:17.419
something else pops
into my head.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.880
Now it's just a bloated,
jumbled up mess of words.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.383
(Sighs) I'm going to bomb
and all those colleges

06:23.425 --> 06:25.593
are gonna pull their
scholarship offers.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.053
- Pretty sure that's
impossible.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.888
Besides you're gonna rock
the speech.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.682
- Yeah, dude,
you're gonna kill it.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.225
And then you're gonna go off
to your university of choice.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.852
For another ten years
of schooling -

06:33.893 --> 06:35.603
which, I still think is crazy
by the way.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.105
- Yeah, you keep saying.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.982
- Ahh. I'm so pumped to be
on the road.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.191
Are you guys are still down
to go

06:40.233 --> 06:41.901
on the first leg of the tour?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.737
- As long as I don't implode
on stage.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.740
- Okay. Whatever. We're in.
Yellowstone's gonna be awesome.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.199
- Maybe you guys should like
spend more time

06:48.241 --> 06:49.868
on the road with me...

06:49.909 --> 06:51.745
like the whole summer...

06:51.786 --> 06:53.621
- Or maybe forever if I don't
get into Mount Royal.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.123
- You will. You'll get in.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.375
- I don't know.
Olivia's already got accepted.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.669
- But she applied a long time
ago

06:59.711 --> 07:01.421
- Yeah. Why did I wait so long?

07:01.463 --> 07:03.173
It's like everyone is moving on
to their next big thing

07:03.214 --> 07:05.008
and I'm left in the dust.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.885
- I'm just going on a trip.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.219
- Yeah, but least you have
a plan.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.804
What do I have? Nothing.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.599
- So how did it go
with Grandpa?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.185
You talk to him, right?

07:15.226 --> 07:18.229
- Uh, no. No.
- What? You chickened out?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.774
- I-I-I didn't chicken out,
all right? I'm just...

07:20.815 --> 07:23.026
I-I'm waiting for the opportune
time.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.028
- If that herd is as good
as you say it is,

07:25.070 --> 07:26.946
it won't be around for long.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.782
- I know.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.742
There is actually people
looking at it right now.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.952
- You gotta go for it.
I mean, no risk, no reward.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.330
- Lou, I've-I've tried that.
- I get it.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.415
I know how hard it is
to have business partners

07:37.457 --> 07:40.001
especially when they're as
stubborn as my dad and grandpa.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.337
But putting off this
conversation could cost you

07:42.379 --> 07:44.964
an incredible opportunity.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.175
- Yeah. You're right.
I gotta act on this right now.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.511
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.974
- You've done an amazing job
with this place.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.228
- Oh. Well, I can't take all
the credit.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.772
Fairfield's been in my family
for a very long time.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.192
And it's nothing compared
to your operation.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.236
- (Chuckles) Well, maybe it's
not as big,

08:06.277 --> 08:08.988
but there's a real sense
of class here.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.865
- Thank you.

08:10.907 --> 08:11.908
That means a lot,
coming from you.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.993
(Shooting Star whinnies)
- Wow.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.080
What a beautiful horse.
- Yeah, she is.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.082
Her name's Shooting Star,
and she's a race horse,

08:19.124 --> 08:20.500
but I'm hoping that
granddaughter, Amy,

08:20.542 --> 08:22.919
can retrain her as a jumper.
(Chuckles)

08:22.961 --> 08:23.878
- Hi, Amy.
- Hi.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.048
- Quinn McGregor.
- Oh. Ah...

08:28.425 --> 08:29.884
you're the guy from Florida?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.803
- No, I'm-I'm that guy's son.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.972
So, this horse is gonna be
a jumper?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.807
- Well, that's the plan.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.018
But she's not so great
at taking direction.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.144
A little hard on the mouth,

08:39.184 --> 08:41.187
but we're working thought it.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.063
- Well, I'd love to see how
you make that transition.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.108
Must be quite the process.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.360
- Yeah. Well, you're welcome
to watch me work if you want.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.154
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- Okay.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.822
Come on, Star.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.532
(Footsteps thud)

08:54.242 --> 08:56.745
- Hey.
- You scared me.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.204
What are you doing here?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.331
- My mom's new boyfriend
just moved in...

09:00.373 --> 09:02.500
with his tween daughter.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.627
I had to escape
for a few hours.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.171
- Could have called.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.089
- Yeah. Yeah, I will next time.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.216
So what the deal with
the after-party tomorrow?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.010
- There isn't one.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.928
- What?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.472
- Probably just gonna do
something with Adam and Wyatt -

09:15.513 --> 09:18.391
go to Maggie's.
- That so lame.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.727
After my grad
we had this huge rager.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.896
It was awesome!
Everyone was there.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.773
- It's not that big a deal
to me.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.109
**

09:30.320 --> 09:31.988
(Cattle moo)
- (Exhales)

09:32.030 --> 09:33.323
Okay.
- All right.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.075
Good job.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.869
There you go.
Get over here.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.958
(Gate creaks)
(Tired exhale)

09:47.128 --> 09:49.923
- Oh, nice of you to come back.
We're done.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.008
- Oh. Sorry about that.

09:52.050 --> 09:52.967
Um... listen, I uh...

09:55.428 --> 09:58.056
actually I was hoping to talk
to you guys about something?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.100
- Oh, let me guess,
you jumped the gun

10:00.141 --> 10:02.018
and asked someone else
to marry you.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.103
- No... why...

10:03.144 --> 10:05.063
why would you...?

10:05.105 --> 10:08.191
Uh, no. It's-it's about a herd,
actually, for sale--

10:08.233 --> 10:10.402
- Ah, Mitch. C'mon.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.278
- Jack, just hear me out
on this one, all right?

10:12.320 --> 10:15.281
- No, I've made my feeling
pretty clear on expansion.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.575
- I know. And...
you're concerned about

10:17.617 --> 10:19.577
maintaining the level
of quality,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.455
but this herd is grass fed,
it's grade-A quality.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.290
- You know, I don't care
what they are,

10:24.332 --> 10:26.543
we don't have the room.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.461
- You know, we can keep them
in the property

10:28.503 --> 10:30.338
that I just bought.
- No, that's too far away.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.340
I wanna check on them
every day.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.301
- Okay, listen, Jack,
I hear you, okay?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.845
I understand your concerns
on this,

10:36.886 --> 10:38.555
but this-this is an
opportunity,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.181
a rare opportunity that I think
we need to jump on.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.225
- Mitch, I'm sorry,

10:42.267 --> 10:44.936
but I'm done talking
about this.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.939
I've said no,
I'm still saying no,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.358
and it'll continue to be no
as long as I have a say.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.694
So please just quit asking.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.868
- Wait. Well, what if I just
bought the herd by myself then?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.203
- What do you mean by that?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.874
- No risk, no reward, right?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.085
- What exactly are you saying?

11:09.127 --> 11:11.046
- I guess what I'm saying...

11:13.006 --> 11:15.133
it's been amazing being in
business with you, guys, but...

11:15.175 --> 11:16.885
I gotta do this.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.138
I'm buying the herd.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.061
- Hey, you talk to Grandpa?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.398
- Yes, I did.
- Oh my God, he went for it?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.525
- No he didn't.
He hated it actually.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.070
But it-it's okay because
the advice you gave me

11:35.111 --> 11:37.030
was swirling around in my head.
- What advice?

11:37.072 --> 11:38.448
- Oh, you know,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.325
you told me about ceasing
the opportunity

11:40.367 --> 11:43.495
and taking risks.
So I just kind of blurted out,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.705
"Well, fine then,
I'll buy the herd myself".

11:45.747 --> 11:47.999
- What?
- I know. It's a little crazy.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.001
But I-I think it's gonna work.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.419
You know,
I can get a bank loan,

11:51.461 --> 11:53.254
who can't get a bank loan.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.173
And then I can keep the herd
on our land at Aspen Gove.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.008
- But that's supposed to be our
vacation property.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.093
You're not gonna move out there
full-time?

12:00.512 --> 12:02.305
- All right, there's still
a couple details

12:02.347 --> 12:04.224
that need to be ironed out,
but...

12:04.265 --> 12:06.142
I feel good about this.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.728
Thank you for giving me
the push.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.316
(Relieved exhale)

12:13.358 --> 12:17.278
**

12:17.320 --> 12:19.155
(Latch clicks)

12:19.197 --> 12:21.157
(Horse whinnies)

12:21.199 --> 12:23.618
- I thought I saw a light on
out here.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.537
- Yeah, just struggling to get
to sleep.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.956
- Big day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.544
- Well, I can't believe
you're graduating.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.213
Do you remember the first day
you showed up here?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.925
Now I can't imagine you
anywhere else.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.301
- Yeah.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.723
I just keep thinking
about what's next.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.224
- What might that be?
- I don't know.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.728
That's the problem.
School's over,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.604
and I have no idea
what happens now.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.732
- I'm sure that university,

12:53.773 --> 12:56.067
they'll get back to you
any day now.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.318
- Yeah. But... what if I don't
get in?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.700
- You know,

13:03.742 --> 13:07.537
sometimes even when you think
you've got it all planned out

13:07.579 --> 13:10.123
you don't really have a clue.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.460
When I was your age,
a bit older maybe,

13:13.501 --> 13:15.545
I hit the road.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.089
I put this place in my rear
view mirror,

13:18.131 --> 13:20.258
and I wasn't ever coming back.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.970
Then well...

13:25.347 --> 13:26.473
my sister...

13:26.514 --> 13:28.516
- I know,

13:28.558 --> 13:31.353
Amy told me what her.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.355
- Well, that changed everything.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.274
It led me right back here.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.234
It's not how I had it
mapped out,

13:38.276 --> 13:41.363
but I ended up exactly
where I was supposed to be.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.283
So maybe...

13:45.325 --> 13:47.702
enjoy this big accomplishment
now

13:47.744 --> 13:50.705
because tomorrow
is always coming,

13:50.747 --> 13:53.458
and when it does...

13:53.500 --> 13:55.877
you'll end up right where
you're supposed to be too.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.176
I'm proud of you.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.511
- Thanks, Jack.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.059
Good night.
- Good night.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.980
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.237
- Hi.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.655
- You made it!
- Barely.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.157
- Ah, look who's here!
Lisa: Hi Ty.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.326
- One of the other parents
is covering for me.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.619
So I'm gonna drive back
after the ceremony.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.496
- Okay.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.289
- Hey, guess who's taking
her man for a very special

14:33.331 --> 14:35.250
dinner tonight?
New Indian place.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.088
- Uh, just a heads up - he
can't handle the spice he's--

14:40.130 --> 14:42.257
- (Peter chuckles)

14:42.298 --> 14:45.510
Actually, Jen's introduced me
to chicken masala

14:45.552 --> 14:47.429
I'm kinda developing
a little taste for it.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.180
- I just have to be ready
with a napkin

14:49.222 --> 14:50.557
to dab the sweat off
his forehead.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.225
(Both laughing)

14:53.852 --> 14:56.229
- Is Mitch coming?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.356
He'll be here any minute.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.025
- Great.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.115
<i>Man: And now our graduates!</i>

15:07.157 --> 15:09.409
(Applause)
- Woo!

15:09.451 --> 15:11.327
("Pomp and Circumstance" plays)

15:11.369 --> 15:18.543
**

15:18.585 --> 15:20.295
- Dude. Calm down, it's fine.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.799
- I didn't even had a chance
to practice -

15:24.841 --> 15:26.718
I was up all night
rewriting it.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.636
You only have one chance
at the valedictorian speech.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.472
- Just breathe, okay?

15:30.513 --> 15:32.182
When I first met you
I thought you were

15:32.223 --> 15:34.851
this know-it-all brainiac,
which you kinda were.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.853
But then, once I got to know
the real you

15:36.895 --> 15:38.813
I realized that even
with all those brain

15:38.855 --> 15:40.315
you've got an even bigger
heart--

15:40.357 --> 15:42.525
- Stop. I see the way this
plays out in movies.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.152
You're just gonna tell me
to toss my speech

15:44.194 --> 15:45.779
and to speak from the heart--
- Oh no. Don't.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.531
Don't do that. Okay?

15:48.573 --> 15:50.825
What I'm saying is that you
aren't capable of writing

15:50.867 --> 15:53.370
anything less than
a brilliant speech.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.538
So just stick
to what you've got

15:55.580 --> 15:57.624
and just get up there
and do it.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.168
("Pomp and Circumstance"
crescendos to an end)

16:01.753 --> 16:03.588
- Before I wrap up,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.423
I'll leave you with a quote...

16:05.465 --> 16:07.842
"We can only survive if we
have obstacles to overcome.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.178
If you remove those obstacles,

16:10.220 --> 16:11.763
without them to strengthen us,

16:11.805 --> 16:14.349
we will weaken and die."

16:14.391 --> 16:16.267
Okay, maybe that was a bit
over the top,

16:16.309 --> 16:19.396
but hey, Captain Kirk
often spoke in hyperbole.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.523
(All chuckle)

16:21.564 --> 16:23.942
<i>But here's the most important</i>
<i>thing about obstacles.</i>

16:23.983 --> 16:26.194
They aren't meant
to be tackled alone.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.531
The people who had your back

16:29.572 --> 16:31.991
throughout these high school
years...

16:32.033 --> 16:35.286
I mean, those friends
who pushed you out

16:35.328 --> 16:36.871
of your comfort zone,

16:36.913 --> 16:38.540
<i>and forced you to do all kinds</i>
<i>of crazy stuff.</i>

16:41.543 --> 16:43.503
<i>And made you laugh so hard</i>

16:43.545 --> 16:44.879
<i>that you thought your head</i>
<i>might explode.</i>

16:44.921 --> 16:46.381
<i>(Crowd chuckles)</i>

16:47.924 --> 16:49.551
But then they could pull
you in.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.555
<i>When you needed to know</i>
<i>that you weren't alone</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

16:55.849 --> 16:58.435
<i>These are the people</i>
<i>who will help you obliterate</i>
<i>any obstacle</i>

16:58.476 --> 17:01.229
<i>like a photon torpedo taking</i>
<i>down a klingon bird of prey.</i>

17:01.271 --> 17:02.689
- Congratulations.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.648
<i>- So keep those bonds tight...</i>

17:04.691 --> 17:07.484
<i>because together,</i>

back, okay?

17:37.932 --> 17:40.352

family business at Fairfield.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.802
- So you know him too then?

18:13.843 --> 18:15.303
- I do, as of yesterday.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.349
- Are you guys all related
or something?

18:19.391 --> 18:20.767
- Yeah. We are.
- Yeah.

know each other?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.109

18:31.444 --> 18:32.904
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to cause all the confusion.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.657
I just... I was in town,

18:35.699 --> 18:37.409
and thought I'd come by
and surprise you.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.661
Say congratulations.
- Thanks.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.792

18:45.834 --> 18:47.585
I'll leave you...

but I can't come tonight.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.605
I...

19:07.647 --> 19:08.857
I have a hot date so. Bye.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.694
- Okay, bye.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.362
What is she talking about?
Where can't she go?

19:15.739 --> 19:17.449
- You are throwing
an epic grad party!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.451
I invited your whole grade.
- What!?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.119
- Don't worry, I'm gonna help
you make it

19:21.161 --> 19:23.079
the best shaker ever.
- I don't think so.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.497
- Why not?
You have your own place.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.041
- And we do only graduate
high school once.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.168
- You're okay with this?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.627
- I don't know if it's
the adrenaline talking,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.087
or that I won't
have to see Olivia,

19:31.129 --> 19:33.006
but I think we should
celebrate.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.508
- Okay. Fine.
I'll talk to my parents.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.594
But you have to help me
clean up, before and after.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.845
- (Giggles)

19:40.638 --> 19:42.474
- Okay. One more for the books.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.558
- Oh, hey yo. What's up?

19:45.226 --> 19:47.479
- I have to say, I'm really
impressed by your courage

19:47.520 --> 19:49.397
to take on a new herd.
I mean, congratulations, man.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.940
- Yeah. Thanks. Thank you.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.443
I gotta be honest with you,
it's a little scary,

19:53.485 --> 19:55.070
you know just jumping
in this thing.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.196
- Well, maybe I can help you
out there.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.865
- What do you mean?

19:58.907 --> 20:00.867
- Like I say, I admire
your ambition,

20:00.909 --> 20:02.952
and I've always enjoyed doing
business with you. So...

20:02.994 --> 20:04.829
maybe we should talk about
getting your new product

20:04.871 --> 20:06.456
in my stores.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.875
- Wow, I... that'd be great.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.421
Um, I just-I wonder how this is
gonna affect your deal

20:13.463 --> 20:15.048
with Heartland though?

20:15.090 --> 20:16.841
- Look, you know I've been
looking for a way to get

20:16.883 --> 20:18.927
new organic beef in my stores.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.220
<i>And, and maybe you can help me</i>
<i>fill that void.</i>

20:21.680 --> 20:22.931
- He didn't waste any time.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.601
Katie: I'm getting out
of this dress.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.772
- (Sighs) So... that guy...?
- Mom!

20:30.814 --> 20:32.691
- What? I know it's none
of our business...

20:32.732 --> 20:35.485
it's just--
- We just-how old is he?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.612
- 21.
Both: 21?!

20:37.654 --> 20:39.364
- There's nothing going on
between us.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.116
- But there was?

20:41.157 --> 20:43.076
- (Exhales) I have something
else to about anyways.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.953
Jade told everyone at school
that I'm throwing a party

20:44.994 --> 20:46.913
in the loft tonight.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.832
- Well, would have been nice
to get a bit more notice.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.709
- Yeah. That's what I said.
So I'm just gonna make sure

20:50.750 --> 20:52.585
that everything stays under
control.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.129
- Okay. Well, Grandpa is only
gonna be 100 yards away...

20:54.170 --> 20:56.047
watching.
- Great.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.757
- Yeah. We tryst you,
Sweetheart.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.300
We gotta find out more
about this guy.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.682
- Lou, did your boyfriend
tell you what he's up to?

21:05.724 --> 21:08.643
- That he bought his own herd?
Yes. I know.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.520
- He's already talking
to Garland.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.148
- What?
- Yeah, we were leaving town

21:13.189 --> 21:15.608
we saw them together on
the sidewalk... talking.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.194
- Kinda sounds like he's trying
to poach our client.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.280
- That is not true.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.741
Okay. Look, this is gonna work
out better for everyone.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.785
You have one less partner
to share your profits with.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.454
- Well, it's not about
the money.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.164
- Really?

21:29.205 --> 21:30.874
- We were supposed to be
in this together.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.209
- You know what? I'm not gonna
get in the middle!

21:33.251 --> 21:34.878
You can talk to Mitch.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.796
You're all big boys.

21:40.425 --> 21:45.805
**

21:45.847 --> 21:47.682
(Frustrated exhale)
Easy. Easy. Easy.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.811
(Star nickers)

21:54.022 --> 22:01.529
**

22:01.571 --> 22:04.157
<i>Pick up your feet, come on!</i>

22:04.199 --> 22:06.201
(Frustrated sigh)

22:06.242 --> 22:08.161
- She's going to need a lot
of work, huh?

22:08.203 --> 22:10.872
- Oh yeah, she's pretty high
strung.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.625
I'm just having a hard time
keeping her under control.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.794
- That's the racehorse in her,
eh?

22:15.835 --> 22:17.629
- Yeah. She-she comes up,
and just over-jumps,

22:17.671 --> 22:19.756
and then takes off like a shot.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.883
- You know, I'm still interested
to see how this works out.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.593
- Are you?

22:23.635 --> 22:25.929
Because I have to admit,
I'm starting to think that

22:25.970 --> 22:27.597
maybe you're just hanging
around here

22:27.639 --> 22:28.932
to get to someone else.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.142
- I did not connect the dots

22:31.184 --> 22:33.645
between you, Lisa to Georgie.
Honestly.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.105
- You know, Quinn,

22:35.146 --> 22:37.148
I-I know what it's like
to be on the road

22:37.190 --> 22:39.567
how close you get with
the people you're around.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.986
And then how tough it is
when you have to leave.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.116
I don't think you're here
for Lisa's stud,

22:46.157 --> 22:48.576
or to watch me retrain a race
horse to be a jumper.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.080
I think you're here
for Georgie.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.748
- Why can't it be all three?

22:55.208 --> 22:56.751
(Small laugh)

22:58.712 --> 23:00.672
(Star nickers, hooves rustle
in the foliage)

23:07.095 --> 23:09.180
- Where were you?

23:09.222 --> 23:11.808
You missed Georgie's grad?
- I know. I'm sorry.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.977
The stuff at the bank went
longer then I thought.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.770
- And then you met
with Garland?

23:17.272 --> 23:19.566
- Yeah. How did...

23:19.607 --> 23:20.775
how did you know about that?

23:20.817 --> 23:22.944
- Because Dad and Grandpa
saw you.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.612
- Ugh... gees.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.035
- What's going on?

23:30.076 --> 23:32.078
- Um... (Phone vibrates)

23:32.120 --> 23:33.913
uh, sorry.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.415
(Beeps phone on)
Hello.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.126
Yeah. Hi.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.463
Tonight? Um...

23:44.174 --> 23:45.592
yeah. Yeah. Great.
Tonight's...

23:45.633 --> 23:47.052
tonight's perfect.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.762
I'll see you then.

23:48.803 --> 23:49.971
Bye.
(Beeps phone off)

23:51.890 --> 23:53.391
- We're supposed to go
for dinner.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.268
Are you bailing on me again?
- I know, it was Garland.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.270
He wants to talk about
a contract. I'm sorry.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.730
- It's okay. I...I get it.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.692
- I'll fill you in when I get
back, I promise.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.152
- Okay.
- Thank you.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.905
I'm sorry.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.455
(Loud Pop music plays)

24:17.082 --> 24:18.166
(Party goes chatter)

24:21.002 --> 24:28.385
**

24:28.426 --> 24:30.387
- (Sighs) My parents agreed
to a small party.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.056
This place is packed!
- Okay, you need to chill out.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.516
Join the party, okay?

24:36.518 --> 24:39.020
* I don't wanna be
the only fool *

24:39.062 --> 24:40.980
* There goes my heart *

24:41.022 --> 24:42.857
* Catch it if you can *

24:42.899 --> 24:44.734
* Said I couldn't leave *

24:44.776 --> 24:46.820
* But you grabbed me *
by the hand so *

24:46.861 --> 24:48.863
* I don't wanna be
the only fool *

24:50.365 --> 24:53.201
* I don't wanna be
the only fool *

24:54.577 --> 24:56.996
- Come on.

24:57.038 --> 25:00.041
* Finding it hard to believe *

25:00.083 --> 25:02.210
* That this is getting
any better now *

25:04.462 --> 25:06.172
- I thought we agreed

25:06.214 --> 25:07.799
we weren't gonna do this kind
of thing, Quinn.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.884
How could you just show up here?

25:14.139 --> 25:16.182
- I just wanna talk to you,

25:16.224 --> 25:18.226
and you've been totally
ghosting me, so.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.730
I mean, what's a guy gotta do?

25:21.771 --> 25:23.565
- How about follow the rules
that we agreed to.

25:24.733 --> 25:26.901
We had...

25:26.943 --> 25:29.821
whatever it was that we had
in Europe.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.698
But you live in Florida.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.533
And I told you I...

25:33.575 --> 25:35.869
I can't do the whole
long distance thing.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.580
- True.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.085
But I am standing right here.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.712
- Very funny.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.258
But soon you won't be.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.388
So what's the point?

25:55.430 --> 25:58.892
* I don't wanna be
the only fool *

25:58.933 --> 26:01.061
* I don't wanna be
the only fool *

26:10.236 --> 26:11.988
(Music lowers)

26:12.030 --> 26:13.239
- All right, everybody,
listen up!

26:16.868 --> 26:19.746
Congratulations on your
graduation today.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.250
There is no doubt you all have
a bright future ahead of you...

26:26.294 --> 26:29.130
so long as you don't go
and mess it up here tonight.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.929
You all have fun now.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.056
Boy: Um, thanks.
Girl: Thanks.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.808
(Giggling)

26:40.934 --> 26:42.936
(Turns music up)

26:42.977 --> 26:44.479
* Honey, let me hold you *

26:44.521 --> 26:46.439
* Like I told you *

26:46.481 --> 26:47.982
* Never enough *

26:49.275 --> 26:50.652
- Great.

26:52.153 --> 26:54.239
- Well, how is it going up
there in the loft?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.157
- Oh, I think I made my point.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.784
(Giggling)

26:57.826 --> 27:00.412
- Was he there? That Quinn guy?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.580
- I don't think...
well, I didn't see him.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.457
Is there something going on
with him and Georgie?

27:04.499 --> 27:06.209
- That's what I'd like to know.

27:06.251 --> 27:09.004
- Well, I have spent some time
with him at Lisa's

27:09.045 --> 27:11.131
and I have to say
he is quite the charmer.

27:11.172 --> 27:12.674
- Oh yes.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.219
Enough about him.
How is my horse?

27:16.261 --> 27:17.887
How are we doing with Star?

27:17.929 --> 27:19.597
- Might have started jumping
too quickly.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.641
I'm just looking through my
mom's journal

27:21.683 --> 27:23.852
to see if there is a way
to take it back a little bit.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.145
Just teach her some patience
first.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.480
- She's rushing?
- Yeah.

27:27.522 --> 27:29.858
She might not be suited
to jumping.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.443
Not all race horses can do it,

27:31.484 --> 27:33.987
some just have too much fire.

27:34.029 --> 27:37.032
- Well, hopefully you can douse
her a little bit.

27:37.073 --> 27:39.242
- See if you can douse some of
Quinn's fire

27:39.284 --> 27:41.411
while you're at it.
(All laugh)

27:41.453 --> 27:42.996
(Loud party chatter)

27:44.914 --> 27:46.958
- Nice of Jack to drop by.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.335
- Yeah, I'm just happy
he didn't show up

27:48.376 --> 27:50.378
with his hunting rifle
slung over his shoulder.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.088
- Yeah, but he wasn't the only
one to crash our party.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.798
Who was that weird dude?

27:53.840 --> 27:55.383
- Uh, he's just a showjumper.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.469
I met him at camp.
He lives in Florida.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.262
- Oh yeah. Wh-why is he all
the way up here then?

27:59.304 --> 28:00.847
- I didn't know why he came.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.058
- Huh. Were you guys uh, like--

28:03.099 --> 28:05.977
- No, it wasn't worth
mentioning.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.355
- Okay. So why-why-why
was he here?

28:08.396 --> 28:10.148
- Okay, guys, this party's on
life support.

28:10.190 --> 28:12.108
Get out there and dance!

28:12.150 --> 28:14.486
Go. Go. You too. Go!

28:14.527 --> 28:16.363
All right is everybody
having fun?

28:16.404 --> 28:18.239
Is everybody having fun?!

28:18.281 --> 28:20.408
All right!

28:20.450 --> 28:23.370
(Music gets louder)
(Party favour pops, all cheer)

28:25.121 --> 28:26.373
- Party is still rocking out
there, huh?

28:26.414 --> 28:28.625
- Oh my gosh, it sure is.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.418
It's killing me not going over
there and looking.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.212
- (Peter chuckles)

28:32.253 --> 28:34.464
- Um... how was your chicken
masala?

28:34.506 --> 28:35.924
- Uh, to be honest?

28:37.425 --> 28:38.927
My mouth is still on fire.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.679
- (Laughs) I knew it.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.139
You haven't really acquired
a taste.

28:43.181 --> 28:46.393
- More of a tolerance.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.228
Indian is her favourite though,
so what you gonna go?

28:48.269 --> 28:50.980
- Well, at least she showed up
for your date.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.108
- No! What?
Mitch stood you up?

28:53.149 --> 28:55.485
- Hm. Second time today.

28:55.527 --> 28:57.362
- What's all that about?

28:57.404 --> 28:59.447
- Oh, it's nothing.
He's just busy.

29:01.616 --> 29:03.618
He bought his own herd.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.495
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.664
- Wow. Where's he gonna keep
them?

29:07.706 --> 29:09.040
- Um, we bought a ranch.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.335
It just supposed to be
a vacation spot.

29:12.377 --> 29:14.129
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.339
You guys bought a place
together.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.467
- Yeah. We just kinda went
for it.

29:23.096 --> 29:26.266
Wow. I'm-I'm very happy

29:26.307 --> 29:27.475
that everything is working out
for you guys.

29:27.517 --> 29:29.436
- Thank you.

29:29.477 --> 29:31.604
I'm really happy for you
and Jen as well.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.732
- Thank you.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.109
- Um, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

29:36.151 --> 29:38.987
Big day.
- Yeah, it was.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.447
Okay.
- All right.

29:40.488 --> 29:42.073
(Clears throat)
Good night.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.496
(Receding footsteps)

29:51.082 --> 29:57.630

29:57.672 --> 29:59.382

and a slow tune plays)

**

30:08.016 --> 30:13.146
**

30:13.188 --> 30:15.106
- Do you remember dancing
to this in Brussels?

30:15.148 --> 30:18.151
- Yes, and that's exactly
why you played it,

30:18.193 --> 30:20.028
isn't it?

30:20.070 --> 30:21.029
- Really? Maybe?

30:23.031 --> 30:24.741
In that case...

30:24.783 --> 30:26.659
may I have this dance?

30:26.701 --> 30:28.328
* Back to the hurt
you got used to *

30:29.621 --> 30:31.331
* Starving for air *

30:31.373 --> 30:33.833
* It's hard to breathe *

30:33.875 --> 30:37.253
* Why don't you see what
you could have with me *

30:37.295 --> 30:39.172
* If you live in the past *

30:39.214 --> 30:41.508
* It'll be your tomb *

30:41.549 --> 30:44.552
* So how can I say this *

30:44.594 --> 30:46.638
* Just so that you know *

30:46.680 --> 30:49.557
* I've wanted this all
for so long *

30:52.435 --> 30:54.396
* Just so that you know *

30:54.437 --> 30:58.358
* I've wanted this all
for so long *

31:00.819 --> 31:03.363
* Higher than high
Higher than high *

31:03.405 --> 31:05.073
* Woo ooh *
* Higher than high *

31:05.115 --> 31:06.866
- Oh my God...
- Whoa...

31:08.326 --> 31:10.578
* Higher than high
Higher than high *

31:12.455 --> 31:14.374
* Higher than high *
- Okay.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.501
* All keeps coming back to you *

31:19.170 --> 31:21.131
- (Realizing exhales)

31:21.172 --> 31:24.634
* Where did you run to,
Darling *

31:24.676 --> 31:26.845
- That was totally offside.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.180
- Why? That's-that's no
different than Europe?

31:29.222 --> 31:31.725
- This isn't Europe.
This is real life.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.476
And I'm having a hard enough
time trying to figure out

31:33.518 --> 31:35.353
what that looks like right now.

31:35.395 --> 31:37.647
High school is over,
I'm not jumping any more,

31:37.689 --> 31:39.441
I don't have a coach--
- Wait, what?

31:40.900 --> 31:42.527
What do you mean you're not
jumping any more?

31:42.569 --> 31:43.695
- I'm taking a break.

31:43.737 --> 31:46.156
It was getting too consuming.

31:46.197 --> 31:48.241
- I uh... I don't understand,
Georgie.

31:50.285 --> 31:51.745
You... you're one of the most
talented jumpers I've ever met.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.538
- You can stop laying it on
so thick.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.415
- No, no. I'm... I'm serious.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.294
You're an incredible jumper.

31:59.336 --> 32:01.212
And you're an incredible
person.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.383
That's why I'm here.

32:05.425 --> 32:06.968
- Then you've wasted your time.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.681
It was hard enough saying
good bye the first time.

32:11.723 --> 32:15.185
* Higher than high
Higher than high *

32:15.226 --> 32:16.686
- All right.

32:16.728 --> 32:19.064
* Higher than high
Higher than high *

32:19.105 --> 32:21.149
* Higher than high *

32:23.735 --> 32:25.570
* Higher than high
Higher than high *

32:31.659 --> 32:32.994
- Hey stranger.
- Hey. I'm so sorry.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.498
Ah... listen about yesterday,
I just...

32:37.874 --> 32:39.626
I've been going crazy,
you know.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.628
Garland's been really pushing
me. It's just been a lot.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.797
- What does he want?

32:43.838 --> 32:47.133
- He wants to sell Aspen Grove
Beef.

32:47.175 --> 32:49.552
- What about Heartland beef?

32:49.594 --> 32:51.471
- He said he's gonna sell it
too.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.183
(Exhales) Agh!

32:55.225 --> 32:56.393
This is bad, I know it's bad.

32:56.434 --> 32:57.686
I gotta fix this with Jack
and Tim.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.854
Are they around? Do you know?

32:59.896 --> 33:02.190
- No. They're in the field.

33:02.232 --> 33:04.192
- Okay. Great.
Thanks.

33:09.864 --> 33:19.791
**

33:19.833 --> 33:21.376
- Jade.

33:22.627 --> 33:25.338
Jade, wake up.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.549
- Okay.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.050
Ugh. I'm getting up.

33:31.845 --> 33:34.055
Wait a minute, I'm having
a total flashback -

33:35.432 --> 33:37.767
who was that dude?
- No one.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.478
- Okay. Well, you guys were
all over each other

33:40.520 --> 33:41.646
- Can we please just clean up?

33:44.858 --> 33:47.193
- How about I make you a deal.

33:47.235 --> 33:49.571
I'll clean this entire place...

33:49.612 --> 33:52.407
- I am not talking
about that guy.

33:52.449 --> 33:54.492
- I-I'm not going there. Yet.

33:54.534 --> 33:56.703
But...

33:56.745 --> 33:58.538
how about I stay with you
for a while.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.999
- As a roommate?
- Yeah.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.792
Then I won't have to stay
with my mom

34:02.834 --> 34:04.586
and her boyfriend
and his crazy daughter.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.757
- And what will I
get out of this?

34:09.882 --> 34:12.510
- Me.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.262
I think you could use someone
to inject

34:14.304 --> 34:16.181
a little fun in your life.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.974
Like this is-this is awesome.

34:18.016 --> 34:20.685
I'm gonna go get my stuff.
This is gonna be great.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.395
- You said you'd clean up!
- Mhmm.

34:24.731 --> 34:26.440
(Effort grunts)

34:29.110 --> 34:32.405
- Oh, look who it is,
Mr. Aspen Grove Beef.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.742
- I came to clear the air.
- You came to clear the air?

34:35.784 --> 34:38.703
What? Over the mess you left us
in, by bailing on us?

34:38.745 --> 34:40.538
Or about the part where
you chased down our client,

34:40.580 --> 34:42.748
Garland, outside of Maggie's?
'Cause that's pathetic.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.876
- Okay. Easy, Tim--
- Oh, you're the one

34:44.918 --> 34:46.670
that tried to convince me
to bring into the fold

34:46.710 --> 34:48.420
because he was like family.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.047
Is this how you treat family,
Mitch?

34:50.090 --> 34:51.925
By stabbing them in the back?
- That's not what I'm doing.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.677
- Well, it looks like it to me.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.804
What were are you thinking,
huh?

34:56.846 --> 34:57.931
We're the once that gave you
your first chance.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.891
- I know. I know.

34:59.933 --> 35:01.601
I'm the one that wants to put
the herds together, rem--

35:03.478 --> 35:04.896
Look, maybe we can still
team up--

35:04.938 --> 35:06.940
- No. No. No.

35:06.981 --> 35:08.733
You made the choice,
you're on your own.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.777
Sorry, buddy.

35:10.819 --> 35:12.946
You think you can compete
with us?

35:12.987 --> 35:14.572
With the experience we have
in the cattle business,

35:14.614 --> 35:15.990
I don't think so.

35:16.032 --> 35:18.743
I think, I really like
our chances.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.578
(Calming sigh)

35:20.620 --> 35:22.497
Dismissed.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.877
(Horse snorts)

35:27.919 --> 35:29.713
- Was that really necessary?

35:29.754 --> 35:31.881
- It wouldn't have been,

35:31.923 --> 35:33.633
if you had let us buy that herd
in the first place.

35:38.430 --> 35:39.597
(Screen door shuts)
- Hey guys.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.016
- Hi.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.934
- Sorry if the party got
a little loud last night.

35:42.976 --> 35:44.811
- Nah.
- It wasn't that bad at all.

35:44.853 --> 35:46.813
- Yeah, we're glad you a good
time.

35:46.855 --> 35:48.648
Uh, we did wanna talk to you
about something though.

35:48.690 --> 35:49.691
This guy, Quinn...?

35:51.484 --> 35:52.944
- Is it true that he came all
the way from Florida

35:52.986 --> 35:54.946
just to see you?
- No, no.

35:54.988 --> 35:57.741
He's here on business.
- Business?

35:57.782 --> 35:59.617
Lisa says that he's here to
get reacquainted with a girl.

35:59.659 --> 36:01.870
- Uh... uh... well...

36:01.911 --> 36:04.789
sorry, but that is what he said
when we first talked.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.416
- Okay. Well, then he shouldn't
have come.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.418
I told him it was over
in Europe.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.545
It was just like a... thing.

36:10.587 --> 36:12.297
- A thing...?

36:12.339 --> 36:13.715
Wha? I'm sorry...

36:13.757 --> 36:14.966
what's-what does
that even mean?

36:15.008 --> 36:16.634
What's-what's a thing?

36:16.676 --> 36:17.886
- Ugh. He never should have
come.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.388
- People do crazy things
for love.

36:20.430 --> 36:22.307
Is it love?

36:22.349 --> 36:23.892
- Mail's here.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.645
You got something.

36:27.687 --> 36:29.230
- Mount Royal University.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.777
- Open it up!

36:33.818 --> 36:40.200
**

36:40.241 --> 36:42.577
- (Calming exhale)
Lou: What's it say?

36:44.996 --> 36:47.415
- In. I got in...
I got in!

36:47.457 --> 36:49.709
(Laughing)

36:49.751 --> 36:51.753
- Agh.
- I'm so proud of you.

36:51.795 --> 36:56.424
- I knew it. Hm.
- This is very good news.

36:59.761 --> 37:02.013
- There she is... college girl.

37:02.305 --> 37:05.392
I made you some banana chocolate
chip muffins to celebrate.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.936
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:07.977 --> 37:10.105
- I hardly slept last night.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.898
I keep thinking about what
this program could lead to...

37:11.940 --> 37:14.484
like a management degree
or something.

37:14.526 --> 37:15.860
Maybe I could even follow in
your footsteps?

37:15.902 --> 37:18.029
- Oh. Well, that's interesting.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.906
I thought you wanted to jump?

37:19.948 --> 37:22.200
- Uh, yeah, I do.
But that was...

37:22.242 --> 37:23.702
I don't know, it's not really
like a forever thing.

37:25.245 --> 37:26.996
If I manage a place like
Fairfield

37:27.038 --> 37:28.873
I could stay in the horse
industry.

37:28.915 --> 37:30.417
- I think that's a good plan
for you, honey.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.793
- Do you think...

37:33.211 --> 37:34.879
maybe you could show me
the ropes.

37:34.921 --> 37:36.673
- Sure... you can start today.

37:36.715 --> 37:38.842
- What do you mean?

37:38.883 --> 37:40.719
- Well, summer job.
You wanna come work for me.

37:42.053 --> 37:44.014
- Okay. That-that'd be great.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.557
But I'm supposed to go
on a road trip

37:45.598 --> 37:47.475
with Adam and Wyatt
to Yellowstone

37:47.517 --> 37:48.893
so it would have to be
after that.

37:48.935 --> 37:50.937
- That's fine. Why don't you
come by today,

37:50.979 --> 37:52.731
get the lay of the land, and
then you could officially start

37:52.772 --> 37:54.441
when you get back.
- Okay.

37:54.482 --> 37:55.775
- Yeah.
- Great. Thank you so much!

37:55.817 --> 37:56.985
- Thank you.

37:59.738 --> 38:01.823
(Low hum of chatter)

38:01.865 --> 38:04.075
(Running footsteps thud)
- I got into MRU!

38:04.117 --> 38:05.326
- Oh!

38:06.870 --> 38:08.830
Yeah. Oh my God!
That's awesome.

38:08.872 --> 38:11.082
- Yeah. And Lisa is letting me
work at Fairfield

38:11.124 --> 38:13.001
for the summer. So everything
is coming together.

38:13.043 --> 38:14.878
- Wow. I'm really happy
for you.

38:14.919 --> 38:16.838
- Thanks. Look um...

38:16.880 --> 38:18.965
I'm sorry I can't go on your
whole road trip,

38:19.007 --> 38:20.675
but I can still do Yellowstone.
- Oh. Actually,

38:20.717 --> 38:22.594
I don't think that
that's the best idea maybe.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.346
- What? Why not?

38:28.016 --> 38:29.351
- (Shaky) Um...

38:34.147 --> 38:36.149
Yeah.

38:36.191 --> 38:37.776
(Sniffles)
Look... ah...

38:39.527 --> 38:41.863
I wanna be your friend,

38:41.905 --> 38:43.948
and I really thought that
I could...

38:43.990 --> 38:46.701
but I think that I was
just kidding myself. Again.

38:48.078 --> 38:49.537
Because like uh...

38:49.579 --> 38:51.706
I still have feelings for you.

38:51.748 --> 38:53.750
- Wyatt--
- No. I know,

38:53.792 --> 38:55.460
and I know that you don't feel
the same way.

38:55.502 --> 38:57.587
And it is what it is.

38:57.629 --> 39:00.256
But it was just um,
when I saw you kiss that guy

39:00.298 --> 39:02.300
it just kinda made me feel like

39:02.342 --> 39:03.885
my heart got ripped out
of my chest.

39:03.927 --> 39:05.637
- I'm sorry, but--

39:05.679 --> 39:07.347
- No, you don't need
to apologize.

39:07.389 --> 39:09.057
There is no need to apologize.
It was just that sort of

39:09.099 --> 39:11.393
made me realize that
I need to move on.

39:12.936 --> 39:15.105
(Emotional exhales)

39:15.146 --> 39:15.897
Yeah. Um...

39:17.857 --> 39:20.652
So I think that we should say
good bye...

39:22.737 --> 39:24.572
for real this time.

39:24.614 --> 39:33.957
**

39:33.998 --> 39:35.917
Okay, great.

39:35.959 --> 39:39.045
Good bye, Gerogie.

39:39.087 --> 39:40.380
(Sniffles)

39:42.674 --> 39:44.592
(Emotional exhales)

39:55.937 --> 39:57.981
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:58.023 --> 40:00.608
- Just finishing this up and
I have to head into Maggie's.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.527
- You want a ride?

40:02.569 --> 40:04.696
- Sure. That'd be great.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.865
So how did it go with
and grandpa and dad?

40:09.034 --> 40:10.618
They haven't been in the best
mood since your little chat.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.831
- I asked them one more time
if we could all work together,

40:14.873 --> 40:16.583
they said, they're not
interested.

40:16.624 --> 40:18.418
- Oh...

40:19.878 --> 40:21.588
So what does that mean?

40:23.214 --> 40:26.801
It means that I'm gonna be
working with Garland by my self.

40:26.843 --> 40:29.554
It means Aspen Grove Beef
is gonna be his shelves.

40:31.389 --> 40:33.350
- But it's gonna be in direct
competition

40:33.391 --> 40:35.518
with Heartland beef...
in the same store.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.645
- Yeah.

40:39.356 --> 40:41.107
But I guess that's just how
it's gonna be now.

40:43.735 --> 40:44.986
Let's go.

40:50.450 --> 40:53.661
- Okay, this is your office
for the next little while.

40:55.163 --> 40:57.040
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.292
And I need you to keep it
spotless and organized.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.628
- So you mean like muck
the stalls and stuff?

41:01.670 --> 41:03.296
- Mhmm.

41:03.338 --> 41:05.590
This is where every one
of my employees started out.

41:05.632 --> 41:06.966
- O-kay.

41:08.718 --> 41:10.929
I just, I just thought you were
gonna teach me

41:10.970 --> 41:13.056
more of the management side
of things.

41:13.098 --> 41:15.475
- I am. I promise you.

41:15.517 --> 41:17.644
And this is where it starts...
at the bottom.

41:19.729 --> 41:21.314
Sorry, honey.
- (Small laugh)

41:21.356 --> 41:28.613
**

41:28.655 --> 41:30.031
* Can you feel it *

41:32.325 --> 41:35.078
* Or was it just a dream I had *

41:35.120 --> 41:36.705
* Can you feel it *

41:39.958 --> 41:42.127
Amy: Don't let her get charge-y
down hill, Quinn.

41:42.168 --> 41:44.713
There you go! Beautiful.

41:44.754 --> 41:46.214
Okay.

41:46.256 --> 41:48.633
Just... sit down,
let her relax a little.

41:48.675 --> 41:50.927
(Star whinnies)

41:50.969 --> 41:53.513
(Tack jingles, hooves thud)

41:56.766 --> 41:58.768
- How come Quinn is riding Star?

41:58.810 --> 42:00.812
- He's just helping me out.

42:00.854 --> 42:04.149
(Hooves thud)

42:04.190 --> 42:06.109
Quinn's a pretty great rider,

42:06.151 --> 42:08.069
but I guess you already
know that.

42:08.111 --> 42:14.492
**

42:14.534 --> 42:16.995
That looked great.
Nice run.

42:18.913 --> 42:20.874
Yeah. We just have
to patient with her, okay?

42:20.915 --> 42:22.417
But she's coming around nicely.

42:22.459 --> 42:24.586
(Start snorts)

42:25.920 --> 42:28.506
* Is that your heart
beatin' fast*

42:28.548 --> 42:30.216
- I'm sorry about
the other night.

42:30.258 --> 42:31.926
I was out of line.

42:34.137 --> 42:35.889
Star is not the only one
I need to be more patient with.

42:35.930 --> 42:39.059
* Is that your soul on fire *

42:39.100 --> 42:42.187
* Is that your heart
beatin' fast *

42:42.228 --> 42:44.230
* Is that your mind *

42:44.272 --> 42:46.191
* Telling you my eyes adjust *

42:46.232 --> 42:49.027
* To see there me again *

42:49.069 --> 42:51.112
* Can you feel it *

42:53.281 --> 42:55.992
* Or was it just a dream I had *

42:56.034 --> 42:57.369
* Can you feel it *

42:57.410 --> 43:00.080
(Horse whinnies)

43:00.121 --> 43:02.332
* When you press your hands
against my chest *

43:02.374 --> 43:03.875
* Can you see it *

43:03.917 --> 43:05.752
* In the sky *

43:05.794 --> 43:07.462
* The spirit *

43:07.504 --> 43:09.172
* In the fire *

43:09.214 --> 43:10.799
* Can you hear it *

43:10.840 --> 43:13.009
* In the wind *

43:13.051 --> 43:16.429
* The voice inside my head
again *

43:16.471 --> 43:19.432
* Outrun the river
Outrun the rain *

43:19.474 --> 43:22.936
* Outrun the river
Outrun the rain *

43:22.977 --> 43:25.146
* I'll hold your heart
in my hands *

43:25.188 --> 43:26.439
* And it's safe *

43:26.481 --> 43:28.775
* Outrun the river
Outrun the rain *

43:28.817 --> 43:32.654
