MARTIN, WHAT'RE
YOU DOING HERE?

01:51.400 --> 01:53.320
LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE MARRIED

01:53.360 --> 01:54.440
AND RIDING OFF

01:57.240 --> 01:58.320
WHAT HAPPENED?

-WHAT?

02:02.740 --> 02:05.370
APPARENTLY, I GAMBLE TOO MUCH.
SHE GOT IRRITATED WITH ME.

02:05.410 --> 02:06.960
SHE SHOT ME RIGHT IN THE ASS
FOR THE GAMBLING,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.380
AND THEN SHE SHOT ME AGAIN,
FOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT FOR.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.630
THEN SHE RUNS OFF
WITH THE PHYSIO GUY.

02:11.670 --> 02:14.170
OH MARTIN,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

02:14.210 --> 02:17.180
YEAH, HE WAS A HELL

02:17.220 --> 02:20.140
WELL IT HAS BEEN SUPER
CATCHING UP WITH YOU.

02:21.180 --> 02:22.680

02:26.350 --> 02:28.270

A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.270
THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCES
HAVE CHANGED.

02:30.310 --> 02:33.110
I'M ENTERING
A WHOLE NEW ACT OF
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.190

I NEED SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK

I'M REALLY SORRY.
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

03:11.270 --> 03:13.060
OKAY,
WELL NO NEED TO BE SORRY.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.320

03:15.360 --> 03:18.610
-SO TO GOOD FRIENDS.
-&lt;GLASSES CLINKING&gt;

03:18.650 --> 03:21.820

[MARTIN] OKAY.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.620
SO? HOW BAD IS IT?

03:29.290 --> 03:31.120
IT'S PRETTY BAD.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.380
OR ELSE I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE DOING THIS.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.420
DOING WHAT?

03:34.460 --> 03:35.630
OH...

03:35.670 --> 03:37.050
-GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
-MARTIN, WHAT DID YOU DO?

03:37.090 --> 03:38.090
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

03:40.170 --> 03:43.850
I HAD TO DO THIS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.930
STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.
AGAIN.

03:50.270 --> 03:51.440
HE'S GOT A BADLY
SPRAINED KNEE

03:51.480 --> 03:53.060
AND A MINOR CONCUSSION.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.190
HE'S VERY LUCKY.

03:54.230 --> 03:55.270
[MAL] THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

03:55.310 --> 03:56.820
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
RUN HIM OVER YOURSELF.

03:56.860 --> 03:58.150
MY FAULT?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

03:58.190 --> 03:59.320
THIS IS YOUR FAULT,
NOT MY FAULT.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.070
GUYS! GUYS,
CAN YOU TONE IT DOWN?
IT'S A HOSPITAL.

04:02.110 --> 04:05.490
AND, FOR THE RECORD,
ALTHOUGH I WASN'T THERE,

04:05.530 --> 04:06.950
I'M GUESSING THIS
WAS JAKE'S FAULT.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.330
-CAN WE GO
SEE HIM NOW, PLEASE?
-YES. FOR A MINUTE.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.790
BUT I WARN YOU,
HE'S STILL PRETTY OUT OF IT.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.130
HOW YOU DOING THERE, SON?

04:16.710 --> 04:18.250
OH, I TRIED TO JUMP.

04:18.300 --> 04:22.590
I JUMPED SO PERFECTLY
IN MY HEAD.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.260
FOR A WHILE THERE,
I THOUGHT I WAS DONE.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.100
FROM NOW ON,

04:26.140 --> 04:28.220
I'M GOING TO LIVE EVERY DAY
LIKE IT'S MY LAST.

04:28.260 --> 04:29.890
&lt;SNORING&gt;

04:31.680 --> 04:33.560
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
ONE THING.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.480
WHOEVER DID THIS TO DES,
WHEN WE FIND HIM,

04:35.520 --> 04:37.980
I'M GONNA STRING HIM UP
BY HIS EYELIDS.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.360
ONE THING WE AGREE ON TODAY.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.650
I'M GOING TO TRY ROSE AGAIN.

04:46.490 --> 04:47.830
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-&lt;ROSE GROANING&gt;

04:47.870 --> 04:49.410

04:49.740 --> 04:51.120
ROSIE? ROSE.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.040
WHERE AM I?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.380
OKAY, NOW I REALIZE
I'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPLAINING
TO DO...

04:55.420 --> 04:56.500
WHY AM I TIED UP?

04:56.540 --> 04:57.840
NOW DON'T GO
GETTING ALL EXCITED.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.710
THIS IS NOT SOME KIND
OF WEIRD SEX THING,

04:59.750 --> 05:02.170
-NOTHING LIKE THAT.
WE'RE TOTALLY...
-UNITE ME!

05:02.220 --> 05:03.840
I'M SO SORRY.
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.300
PROTECTION FROM WHO?

05:06.510 --> 05:08.100
DO YOU REMEMBER
FRANCES LEMONT?

05:08.850 --> 05:11.310
YES. ACRYLIC NAILS.

05:11.350 --> 05:14.810
TRACTOR-TRAILER
HIJACKING BUSINESS.
FRICKIN' CLUELESS, MAN.

05:14.850 --> 05:16.100
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.150
I THOUGHT THE TWO OF YOU
GOT ALONG PRETTY GOOD.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.320
MARTIN! WHAT HAPPENED?

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.990
I BOUGHT A LOAD OF
FLAT-SCREENS FROM HER.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.200
SHE GAVE ME AN
UNBELIEVABLE DEAL.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.110
IT WAS A GREAT PRICE.
I COULDN'T SAY NO.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.530
YOU DIDN'T PAY HER.

05:27.570 --> 05:31.790
NOT YET.
AND THEN, SOMEHOW,
SHE GOT THE IDEA THAT, UH...

05:31.830 --> 05:33.620
I SHIPPED ALL OF IT
OUT HERE TO YOU.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.420
REALLY?
NOW, WHY WOULD
SHE THINK THAT?

05:36.790 --> 05:38.080
MAYBE, I TOLD HER THAT.

05:39.460 --> 05:42.300
UNTIE ME RIGHT NOW,
SO I CAN FRICKIN' KILL YOU!

05:42.340 --> 05:44.260
STOP IT.
MAYBE, WE CAN JUST
REASON WITH HER.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.010
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE WAS GONNA COME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

05:46.050 --> 05:47.760
TO NEWFOUNDLAND
AND DIG YOU UP.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.510
-&lt;GUN SHOT ECHOES&gt;
-&lt;ROSE GASPS&gt;

05:51.560 --> 05:52.430
WELL, WELL.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.850
ROSE POOLE.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.020
YEAH, IT'S "DOYLE" NOW.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.520
I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH MARTIN.

06:00.570 --> 06:01.610
WHATEVER.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.570
I LIKE YOUR HAIR THOUGH.

06:03.610 --> 06:04.780
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-YOU TOO.

06:04.820 --> 06:08.160
-WE NEED TO TALK, MARTIN.
-&lt;COCKS GUN&gt;

06:08.200 --> 06:09.870
I'M ALWAYS AFTER HER
TO KEEP THAT PHONE CHARGED.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.030
NOW WHAT?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.990
WELL, IF BUDDY TRIES
TO GET HIS WINDSHIELD FIXED,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.160
I MEAN, ANY GARAGE IN TOWN
WOULD CALL THE POLICE,
RIGHT AWAY.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.460
HE'D NEED SOMEONE
WHO'D TAKE A BRIBE

06:16.500 --> 06:18.460
AND NOT RAT HIM OUT
TO THE COPS.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.330
I THINK WE KNOW WHO TO SEE.

06:21.750 --> 06:22.920
WHO?

06:26.670 --> 06:28.090
[JAKE] NED!

06:28.130 --> 06:30.300
NED BISHOP, OLD BUDDY.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.600
HEY, DIDN'T YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN CAB COMPANY?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.560
OH, I GOT BOUGHT OUT
BY THE BUGDENS.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.480
I WENT BANKRUPT.
I WORKS FOR BUGDENS NOW.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.730
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.190
AND THEN THE WIFE LEFT ME.

06:41.230 --> 06:44.940
RIGHT. UH, NED,
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SEE
A GUY SHOW UP HERE

06:44.980 --> 06:46.570
WITH A BUSTED A WINDSHIELD,
BY ANY CHANCE?

06:46.610 --> 06:49.110
YOU MEAN THE ONE THE COPS
ARE LOOKING AROUND FOR?

06:49.160 --> 06:50.280
NOW, DOYLE,
WHAT DO YOU
TAKE ME FOR?

06:50.320 --> 06:52.200
I'M A PILLAR OF
THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.660
I DON'T DEAL WITH
THE CRIMINAL TYPE.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.120
SO, THAT CAR WITH
THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD,

06:56.160 --> 06:57.830
THAT WOULDN'T BE THE ONE
I'M LOOKING FOR, THEN?

06:57.870 --> 06:59.120
DON'T BE JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.960
I MEAN, I GOT
A PERFECT EXPLANATION.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.420
YEAH. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
20 AND 50 BUCKS, I'M GUESSING.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.460
DAD...

07:04.500 --> 07:06.420
HEY! BUDDY!

07:06.460 --> 07:08.380
YOU LEFT SOMETHING
IN THE ROAD BACK THERE.

07:08.420 --> 07:09.510
OUR LITTLE FRIEND.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.800
DON'T KILL ME!
WE CAN MAKE A DEAL!

07:14.510 --> 07:16.560
NO DEALS TODAY, MY MAN.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.980
WHEN IT COMES TO MY FAMILY,

07:18.020 --> 07:20.190
I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF PATIENCE.
SO START TALKING!

07:20.230 --> 07:21.940
I WOULD DO EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAYS

07:21.980 --> 07:23.770
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM THIS PISSED OFF.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.440
I'LL DOUBLE WHAT THEY'RE
PAYING YOU FOR THE HIT!

07:29.200 --> 07:30.530
[DES]
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, JAKE.

07:30.570 --> 07:31.860
MALACHY, YOU'RE SO CRAZY.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.620
WHAT? OH!

07:37.160 --> 07:38.450
HI.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.420
AM I DEAD?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.130
ARE YOU AN ANGEL?

07:44.170 --> 07:47.510
YOUR HEART IS BEATING
PRETTY FAST, SO, NO.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.510
I'D SAY YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

07:48.550 --> 07:50.340
OH GOOD, OH GOOD.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.640
BECAUSE THE WHOLE DEAD THING,
THAT'S REALLY NOT MY SCENE.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.640
I'M CHANDRA.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.640
GOOD. DOCTOR. NICE.
THAT'S...

07:58.680 --> 08:01.600
I MEAN, I'VE MET LOTS
OF DOCTORS BEFORE.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.480
LOTS OF PEDIOLOGISTS...

08:05.940 --> 08:09.190
ACTUALLY, I'M A MED STUDENT.
THIS IS PART OF MY TRAINING.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.860
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

08:10.900 --> 08:13.700
PLEASE UTILIZE ANY PART
OF MY BODY YOU FIND USEFUL.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.660
I'VE ALREADY DONATED IT
TO SCIENCE, TOO.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.830
-RIGHT.
-RIGHT. YEAH.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.620
BRUCE MICHAELS,
314 FULLERTON CLOSE,
CALGARY?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.290
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU LIVED IN THAT HOUSE,
WHERE YOU RAN OVER DES?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.340
I DO.
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.670
I THOUGHT
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.760
YOU THOUGHT
THAT DES COURTNEY
WAS A HITMAN?

08:31.800 --> 08:32.800
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?

08:32.840 --> 08:34.090
[BRUCE]
I THOUGHT ALL THREE
OF YOU WERE.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.470
HE WAS STANDING IN THE ROAD
IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE.

08:36.510 --> 08:40.430
YOU GUYS WERE STEALING THOSE
SNOW-SLED-MACHINE THINGS.

08:40.470 --> 08:41.810
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S JUST THE COPS.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.310
NO, YOU CAN'T!

08:43.350 --> 08:44.810
I HAVE A CONTRACT ON MY HEAD.

08:44.850 --> 08:48.070
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
BUT IF THEY GET ME,
MY SISTER'S DEAD.

08:48.770 --> 08:49.940
WHAT?

08:49.980 --> 08:51.490
YOUR SISTER WILL DIE?

08:51.530 --> 08:53.740
YES. IT'S ALL ABOUT THIS...

09:02.410 --> 09:03.790
WE DON'T GOT TO DO
ANYMORE REPO CASES.

09:03.830 --> 09:04.920
HOW MUCH YOU GOT IN HERE?

09:04.960 --> 09:06.580
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.000
JUST GIVE US A SECOND.
COME HERE.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.800
TAKE THIS GUY BACK
TO THE OFFICE,

09:13.840 --> 09:16.010
FIGURE OUT IF
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH
ABOUT HIS SISTER.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.010
-HE'S SO FULL OF CRAP, DAD.
-PROBABLY.

09:18.050 --> 09:20.770
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANOTHER INNOCENT PERSON
GETTING HURT HERE.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.180
AND DON'T SPEND THAT MONEY.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.850
WHOA. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:23.890 --> 09:25.600
TO FIND ROSE.
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.190
SO DON'T GO HITTING
ANY POTHOLES.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.110
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

09:35.780 --> 09:37.160
[ROSE] FRANCES,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.700
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR TVS.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.500
MARTIN JUST
COMES RUNNING TO ME
WHENEVER HE'S IN A JAM.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.670
WHY ARE YOU PORTRAYING ME
AS SOME KIND OF
CO-DEPENDENT SAPJAM?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.710
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;
YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER THAT?

09:47.750 --> 09:48.790
YES, PLEASE.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
AN ANSWER ON THAT.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.710
OKAY, WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.920
I WANNA GET PAID FOR MY LCDS,
AND THE TRUCK THEY CAME IN.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.170
YOU STOLE THE TRUCK?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.510
STOLE, NO.

09:56.550 --> 09:59.470
-BORROWED AND LOST IT? YES.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

09:59.510 --> 10:00.680
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.810
I'M HOLDING
BOTH OF YOU RESPONSIBLE.

10:02.850 --> 10:03.970
&lt;RINGING CONTINUES&gt;

10:04.020 --> 10:05.310
MARTIN, SIT DOWN.

10:05.350 --> 10:06.730
-OKAY.
-&lt;RINGING CONTINUES&gt;

10:12.860 --> 10:14.650
MALA...
MALA-KAI?

10:14.690 --> 10:15.820
IT'S "MALACHY."

10:15.860 --> 10:17.070
WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT?

10:17.910 --> 10:18.990
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

10:19.030 --> 10:24.120
OKAY, I STOLE
THE MONEY FROM A VERY...
A BAD MAN.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.580
AND NOW,
HE'S SENT SOMEONE TO KILL ME.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.580
BUT I ONLY STOLE THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR AN OPERATION
IN THE STATES FOR MY SISTER.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.750
LAURA'S ON HER DEATH BED.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.670
SHE NEEDS A NEW KIDNEY.

10:34.710 --> 10:36.920
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GONNA PUT
A HIT OUT ON ME.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.050
NOW IF I END UP DEAD,
SHE DIES, TOO.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.430
YOUR SISTER NEEDS
A NEW KIDNEY?

10:42.470 --> 10:43.720
JAKE, RIGHT?
CAN I CALL YOU JAKE?

10:44.470 --> 10:46.430
SURE, WHY NOT?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.440
JAKE, YOU HAVE
TO LET ME GO.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.650
I'LL GIVE YOU
HALF THE MONEY.

10:52.770 --> 10:53.820
SO YOU'LL GIVE ME
HALF THE MONEY?

10:53.860 --> 10:55.530
-YEAH.
-OH.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.320
SO, I GUESS YOUR SISTER
ONLY NEEDS HALF A KIDNEY,
THEN?

10:59.910 --> 11:03.490
DROP THE KIDNEY STORY
AND ALL THIS SISTER CRAP,
OR I'LL LIGHT YOU ON FIRE.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.750
I GUESS I SHOULD
JUST GET GOING.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.040
YOU STAY EXACTLY
WHERE YOU ARE.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.670
GIVE ME YOUR COAT, IN FACT.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.540
AND YOUR SHOES.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.590
-THIS GUY'S UNBELIEVABLE.
-&lt;PHONE DIALING&gt;

11:16.630 --> 11:17.720
ANY WORD FROM ROSE?

11:18.510 --> 11:19.680
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
I DROPPED BY THE HOUSE.

11:21.470 --> 11:23.220
THERE WAS TWO WINE GLASSES
ON THE TABLE,

11:23.260 --> 11:24.600
AND A TURNED OVER CHAIR.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.930
MAYBE SHE HAD LIKE A DAY-BOIL
THAT GOT REALLY ROUGH.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.060
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?
I'M JOKING.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.770
STOP BEING SO PARANOID.
I'M SURE THAT SHE'S FINE.

11:32.940 --> 11:34.900
I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

11:37.190 --> 11:38.610
WHAT IS THIS?

11:38.650 --> 11:43.030
IT'S A MOTEL KEY
FOR THAT MOTEL OUT UP
AT GOULD'S TRACK.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.450
IF HE'S LIVING IN THAT HOUSE
THAT WE WERE REPOING
THE SKI-DOOS FROM,

11:46.490 --> 11:48.500
WHAT'S HE GOT
A MOTEL ROOM FOR?

11:48.540 --> 11:51.120
WHY DON'T YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT,
I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.080
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.670
I'LL CALL WALTER
TO COME OVER
AND BABYSIT HIM.

11:59.630 --> 12:01.130
&lt;GROANS IN PAIN&gt;

12:01.180 --> 12:02.470
&lt;GROANING CONTINUES&gt;

12:02.510 --> 12:04.470
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO FEEL GOOD?
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.

12:04.510 --> 12:06.220
-HOLD STILL.
-IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.310
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO GIVE YOU A SEDATIVE,
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP.

12:08.350 --> 12:09.640
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I CAN'T TAKE THOSE.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.850
SEE, THEY MAKE ME SLEEPY.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.520
HEY, JUST LOOKING FOR
THE VICTIM OF THE HIT AND RUN.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.770
EXCUSE ME,
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.230
YEAH, WE'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.820
OH, IT'S OKAY.
I'M AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.990
I JUST WANNA ASK
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.

12:22.030 --> 12:24.280
-YOU GET A PLATE NUMBER?
-WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.450
THE WHOLE THING
HAPPENED SO FAST,

12:25.490 --> 12:26.830
I DIDN'T REALLY SEE
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.990
OH, BUT MAYBE,
IF YOU HYPNOTIZE ME SLIGHTLY.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.830
[CHANDRA] SORRY,
WHO DO YOU REPRESENT?

12:30.870 --> 12:33.210
IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO OWNS THE CAR, I MEAN.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.880
A DEDUCTIVE MIND.
I LOVE THAT.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.380
NO, I KNOW WHO OWNS THE CAR.

12:37.420 --> 12:38.750
I JUST GOTTA FIND HIM.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.130
YOU DON'T LOOK
PROFESSIONAL ENOUGH

12:40.170 --> 12:43.930
TO BE AN INSURANCE
PROFESSIONAL, TO ME.

12:43.970 --> 12:47.010
LOOK, JUST STOP ASKING
SO MANY STUPID QUESTIONS.

12:47.050 --> 12:48.680
JUST TELL ME
WHAT I WANNA KNOW!

12:48.720 --> 12:49.770
OKAY,
CAN I SEE SOME ID?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.810
OR MAYBE,
I'LL JUST CALL SECURITY.

12:51.850 --> 12:54.270
LOOK,
I LEFT MY CREDENTIALS
IN THE CAR.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.770
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.030
OKAY, WHAT WAS THAT?

13:03.030 --> 13:04.820
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.870
DANGER AND INTRIGUE
FOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.040
-REALLY?
-REALLY.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.830
AND DOGS LIKE ME TOO.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.920
OH, ACTUALLY,
CAN YOU GET A STILL IMAGE
OF THAT GUY FOR ME,

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
FROM SECURITY?

13:16.580 --> 13:18.290
SURE, I GUESS.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.840
MUCH OBLIGED, DOCTOR.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.880
&lt;COMPUTER CHIMES&gt;

13:22.920 --> 13:24.550
OH! OH! OH, UM...

13:24.590 --> 13:26.840
THAT'S...
THAT'S AN OLD FRIEND, UM...

13:26.890 --> 13:29.470
NOT LIKE AN OLD PERSON,
LIKE, SHE NEEDS A CANE
OR ANYTHING.

13:29.510 --> 13:30.600
IT MIGHT NOT BE A SHE,
IT'S A...

13:30.640 --> 13:32.020
WE'VE GOT ROUNDS, SO...

13:32.060 --> 13:32.980
I'LL CHECK IN ON YOU LATER.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.640
GREAT. THANKS.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.860
&lt;EXHALES&gt; UH...

13:37.900 --> 13:40.150
HEY TINNY, HOW'S ENGLAND?
SORRY, I WAS BUSY.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.900
I'M JUST RECUPERATING
FROM A NEAR-FATAL INJURY.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.530
HEY, FRANCES,
I MIGHT HAVE EXAGGERATED

13:46.570 --> 13:49.160
WHEN I SAID
THAT ROSIE HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THOSE TVS.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.700
OH, "EXAGGERATED"?

13:50.740 --> 13:53.000
OKAY, OKAY.
NOW, I'M KIND OF DRY
ON CASH RIGHT NOW.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.040
-BUT WHAT I DO HAVE
IS A PARCEL OF LAND.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

13:55.080 --> 13:56.250
WOULD YOU BE
INTERESTED IN THIS?

13:56.290 --> 13:58.000
THE WAY THIS PROVINCE IS...
OKAY.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.130
-&lt;RINGING CONTINUES&gt;
-OH, MY GOD.

14:00.170 --> 14:04.260
WHO IS THAT? SHUT IT OFF!
IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE!

14:04.300 --> 14:05.470
I CAN'T SHUT IT OFF.

14:05.510 --> 14:06.800
I WOULD, IF I COULD.

14:06.840 --> 14:10.100
BUT IF IT'S MY HUSBAND AGAIN,
YUP, HE'S GONNA CALL THE COPS.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.140
HE'S GOING TO BE
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.390
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY
MIGHT HAVE SEEN MARTIN

14:12.430 --> 14:14.930
DRAGGING MY BODY
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.770
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.
YOU'D BETTER ANSWER IT.

14:16.810 --> 14:18.190
&lt;RINGING CONTINUES&gt;

14:21.190 --> 14:22.820
BE VERY CAREFUL.

14:24.570 --> 14:25.900
HEY, HONEY.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.030
SORRY, I JUST SAW YOU CALLED.

14:27.070 --> 14:29.870
ROSE! ROSE, THANK GOD.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:29.910 --> 14:30.990
YEAH, NO, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

14:31.030 --> 14:32.950
SORRY, I LEFT MY PHONE
AT HOME IN THE CHARGER.

14:32.990 --> 14:34.580
ROSE, I WAS AT HOME.

14:34.620 --> 14:38.120
OKAY, HUN.
LISTEN, I JUST RAN INTO AN
OLD FRIEND FROM YOGA

14:38.170 --> 14:39.000
AND WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A JOG.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.130
SO, YOU TAKE CARE,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.290
LOVE YOU &lt;BLOWS KISSES&gt;

14:41.340 --> 14:42.960
ROSE, YOU HATE JOGGING.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.970
ROSE? ROSE?

14:49.970 --> 14:52.050
-[TINNY] SO, SOME GUY
JUST RAN YOU OVER?
-&lt;SIRENS WAILING&gt;

14:52.100 --> 14:54.100
-WELL, I WAS THE LOOK OUT.
-&lt;WAILING CONTINUES&gt;

14:54.140 --> 14:55.350
I GUESS YOU BETTER
WORK ON THAT.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.060
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
OVER THE SIREN.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.020
OH NO, THAT'S WEIRD.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.520
I THOUGHT THEY HAD
THE FUNNY BRITISH SIRENS.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.270
THEY, UH, PHASED THEM OUT.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.480
IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE
THE SIREN THAT
PULLED UP OUTSIDE.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.070
YOU'RE WITHIN ONE KILOMETER
OF THIS HOSPITAL ROOM,

15:10.110 --> 15:10.990
SOMEWHERE NORTHWEST
OF MY ROOM.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.990
-YOU'RE NOT IN LONDON! -DES, DON'T BE STUPID.

15:13.030 --> 15:14.620
OBVIOUSLY, I... OH!

15:14.660 --> 15:17.040
TINNY! TINNY! TIN...

15:17.080 --> 15:19.000
TIMOTHY IS A NICE NAME.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.840
HEY.
HOW'S IT GOING, MALACHY?
WHAT'S UP?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.170
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

15:24.210 --> 15:25.670
UH, I GOT HIT BY CAR
AND I'M ON DRUGS.

15:25.710 --> 15:29.170
OKAY. I NEED YOU TO TRACK
A CELL PHONE NUMBER.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.050
ALL RIGHT.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.180
THAT'S ROSE'S NUMBER.

15:34.220 --> 15:35.760
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE'LL DO TO ME,
IF I DO THIS?

15:35.810 --> 15:37.060
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'LL DO TO YOU,
IF YOU DON'T?

15:37.100 --> 15:38.350
OPEN THE LAPTOP, GET TO WORK.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.190
I... I'LL DO IT AS SOON AS
YOU LEAVE THE ROOM.

15:41.230 --> 15:42.980
I GOT THESE SORE
TYPING FINGERS.
I CAN BARELY...

15:43.020 --> 15:44.150

15:44.190 --> 15:45.820

THE DIRTY PICTURES

17:46.690 --> 17:49.230
-I DON'T EVEN WANNA KNOW.
-NO, THERE WAS A WOMAN.

17:49.270 --> 17:51.650
SHE HAD A GUN
AND SHE MADE ME UNDRESS.

17:56.360 --> 18:01.200
JAKE, IF THIS IS ABOUT DES
AND THAT HIT AND RUN,
SO HELP ME...

18:01.240 --> 18:04.620
LESLIE, I HAVE SOMETHING
A LOT BIGGER GOING ON HERE.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.250
NOT FROM
WHERE I'M STANDING,
THERE ISN'T.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.210
YOU HAVE NO REGARD
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES
OF YOUR ACTIONS,

18:13.260 --> 18:15.420
OR THE EFFECT YOUR CHOICES
HAVE ON OTHER PEOPLE.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.050
DES COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED,

18:17.090 --> 18:18.930
AND GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY OTHER
COUNTLESS PEOPLE

18:18.970 --> 18:20.300
HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED
IN YOUR WAKE.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.470
WHERE THE HELL
IS ALL THIS COMING FROM?

18:21.510 --> 18:23.140
IT'S BEEN BREWING FOR A WHILE.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.140
YOU'RE A DISASTER.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.150
DO YOU MIND IF I, UH...

18:29.100 --> 18:30.770
GET A TOWEL TO COVER UP, OR...

18:40.530 --> 18:43.450
FRANCES,
I CAN'T SIT HERE ANYMORE.
MY ASS IS KILLING ME.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.040
I GOTTA GET MY CUSHION.
I GOT A SPECIAL
ONE IN THE CAR.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.080
CAN I GO AND GET IT,
OR CAN YOU GET IT FOR ME?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.500
-IT'S KILLING ME.
-OH, FINE.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.130
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
GO GET IT.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.260
I'VE GOT THE KEYS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.930
THAT'S RIGHT. I REMEMBER
YOU'RE A CRACK SHOT.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.930
WHY WOULD I TRY ANYTHING?

18:59.970 --> 19:01.350
I DON'T WANNA TAKE
ANY CHANCES.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.850
HURRY UP.

19:02.890 --> 19:04.220
OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:04.260 --> 19:05.180
OW! OW!

19:05.220 --> 19:07.180
YEAH, SECOND WIFE SHOT HIM.
TWICE.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.480
SO NOT THAT MUCH LUCK
WITH WOMEN, THEN.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.150
LISTEN,
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THIS
WHEN MARTIN WAS HERE,

19:11.190 --> 19:12.480
BUT I'VE GOT MONEY.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.230
LIKE, HOW MUCH MONEY?

19:14.270 --> 19:15.530
LET ME GO, KEEP HIM,

19:15.570 --> 19:18.360
AND I'LL COME BACK
WITH MY HALF OF THE DEBT.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.360
HOW ABOUT ALL OF IT?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.410
YOU COME BACK
WITH ALL OF IT,

19:21.450 --> 19:23.330
OR THAT EX-HUSBAND
OF YOURS?

19:23.370 --> 19:25.990
HIS BLOOD WILL BE
ON YOUR HANDS,
ALL RIGHT?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.250
OKAY,
I'LL BRING ALL THE MONEY.

19:27.290 --> 19:28.330
ALL THE MONEY.
I'LL BRING IT ALL.

19:28.370 --> 19:29.670
YOU'VE GOT AN HOUR.

19:30.290 --> 19:31.920
ONE MINUTE MORE,

19:31.960 --> 19:33.670
AND HE'S GONNA NEED
A BIGGER ASS CUSHION.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.420
OKAY, OKAY.

19:36.130 --> 19:38.380
&lt;PHONE BEEPING&gt;

19:38.420 --> 19:39.590
WHAT IS THAT?

19:39.630 --> 19:41.300
[ROSE] I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.430
COME ON.

19:42.470 --> 19:43.800
-I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE IT STOP.
-HI.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.260
-&lt;BEEPING CONTINUES&gt;
-FRANCES!

19:45.310 --> 19:47.100
OH!

19:47.140 --> 19:48.890
WHOA, HO, HO!

19:48.930 --> 19:50.390
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.850
THE CAVALRY IS HERE.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.940
HIYA, MALACHY.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.900
-ROSE?
-YUP, IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

19:58.820 --> 19:59.900
YEAH.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.070
&lt;CAR HORNS HONKING&gt;

20:04.120 --> 20:05.910
[HOOD] THANKS FOR
THE APPLE FLIP.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.790
YOU KNOW, IF LESLIE
FINDS YOU HERE,
WE'RE BOTH DEAD MEN.

20:07.830 --> 20:08.870
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

20:08.910 --> 20:12.370
LOOK, I AM NOT AFRAID
OF LESLIE BENNETT.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.290
SO, JUST GIVE ME THE FILE,
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.170
BRUCE'S LICENSE IS A FAKE.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.510
IT'S AN ALIAS FOR
A KNOWN CAREER CRIMINAL
FROM CALGARY

20:19.550 --> 20:22.470
NAMED "BRUCE
PIMPERNEL-HUMBERFIELD".

20:22.510 --> 20:23.840
THAT'S QUITE A HANDLE.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.560
HE'S GOT A RAP-SHEET
A MILE LONG AND A WIFE.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.430
[JAKE] WELL,
THERE'S A FAMILIAR FACE.

20:28.470 --> 20:31.310
SO, SHE WORKS AT
THE GOULD'S TRACK.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.600
WHAT ARE YOU ONTO HERE, DOYLE?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.190
LOOK, I'LL LET...

20:41.280 --> 20:42.610
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE APPLE FLIP?

20:43.240 --> 20:44.360
YEAH, I, UH...

20:44.410 --> 20:45.950
GOT IT EARLIER AT BREEN'S.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.580
NICE OF YOU TO ASK
IF I WANTED ONE.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.080
UM...

20:49.120 --> 20:50.620
NO THANKS. LET'S GO.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.460
-YEAH. YOU'RE NOT
AFRAID OF HER AT ALL.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

20:55.210 --> 20:56.290
SHUT UP!

20:57.750 --> 20:59.590
[JAKE] HELLO? JUST HANG ON.

20:59.630 --> 21:02.170
&lt;CAR ENGINE STARTS&gt;

21:02.220 --> 21:04.380
-[WALTER] I NEED YOU
TO SPOT ME 400 BUCKS.
-WHAT?

21:04.430 --> 21:07.390
BRUCE, HERE, IS A RIOT,
BUT HE'S A GOOD CARD PLAYER.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.720
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU
JUST WATCH OUT FOR HIM.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.350
HE'S SLIPPIER THAN HE LOOKS.

21:11.390 --> 21:13.730
JAKE, I'M A CRIMINAL LAWYER.

21:13.770 --> 21:15.350
I THINK I CAN
HANDLE MYSELF.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.360
AND LISTEN, IF DAD SHOWS UP,
JUST TELL HIM TO CALL ME,
ALL RIGHT?

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
I GOTTA GO.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.860
DOUBLE OR NOTHING?

21:21.900 --> 21:24.650
NO, BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE THE CALL I JUST MADE.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.320
&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;

21:26.360 --> 21:28.160
JAKE TOLD ME NOT TO TRUST YOU.

21:30.450 --> 21:35.750
THOUGH, JAKE IS
A HORRIBLE JUDGE
OF CHARACTER.

21:35.790 --> 21:38.000
WALTER, CAN I CALL YOU "WALT"?

21:38.040 --> 21:40.000
AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY,

21:40.050 --> 21:41.130
"JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
RUNNING FROM YOUR LIFE

21:41.170 --> 21:42.420
"DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T LIVE ONE."

21:42.460 --> 21:43.590
YOU'RE NOT RUNNING,
YOU'RE HIDING.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.140
I THINK THERE'S
A SHOWER IN THE BACK.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.930
IT'S NOT HUGE, BUT WALT,
YOU'RE A RESOURCEFUL GUY.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.350
LADIES...

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
&lt;DOOR CLOSING&gt;

21:58.980 --> 22:01.230
&lt;GIRLS GIGGLING&gt;

22:06.820 --> 22:08.070
&lt;SHIP HORN HONKING&gt;

22:09.530 --> 22:10.410
[MARTIN] SO FRAN, EH,

22:10.450 --> 22:12.040
HOW DO YOU THINK
YOU'D LIKE YOUR STEAK?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.580
DO YOU WANT IT, UH, MEDIUM?

22:14.620 --> 22:17.500
ONE NOD FOR RARE,
GIVE ME TWO FOR WELL DONE.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.380
[MAL] WHY IS MARTIN HERE,
EXACTLY?

22:19.420 --> 22:21.290
AND WHY DOES FRANCES
THINK YOU STOLE HER TVS?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.750
WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER
YOUR STUPID PHONE?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.470
CALM DOWN, OKAY?
I COULDN'T ANSWER IT.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.680
FIRST OF ALL,
MARTIN DRUGGED ME,
THEN I WAS TIED UP.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.970
HE DRUGGED YOU?

22:29.010 --> 22:31.050
THE MAN MAKING
DINNER FOR US
IN OUR KITCHEN?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.560
IT'S NOT WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE...

22:32.600 --> 22:34.770
MAL! MAL! STOP IT...

22:37.390 --> 22:38.480
YOU DRUGGED MY WIFE?

22:38.520 --> 22:39.860
WELL, I HAD TO.
IT WAS FOR HER OWN GOOD.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.230
I WAS JUST KIND OF
HELPING HER OUT.

22:42.270 --> 22:45.070
-WHAT'S WITH THE CANE?
-MY EX-WIFE, SHE SHOT ME.

22:45.110 --> 22:46.780
DID YOU DRUG
AND KIDNAP HER, TOO?

22:46.820 --> 22:48.320
-NO!
-OKAY, COULD YOU CALM DOWN!

22:48.360 --> 22:49.490
-YOU'RE GONNA BUST
A HEART VALVE.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

22:49.530 --> 22:52.240
I'LL CALM DOWN
WHEN YOU CUT THIS MAN
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.290
OH.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.460
THIS IS HOW A PHONE WORKS.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.580
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

22:57.620 --> 22:58.830
THAT'S IT PAL.
GET OUT OF HERE.

22:58.870 --> 23:00.960
-WHAT?
-I CAN HANDLE THIS SITUATION
ON MY OWN!

23:01.000 --> 23:03.630
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE YOU HERE
WITH YOU DEGENERATE EX-HUSBAND

23:03.670 --> 23:05.920
AND A CRAZED LOON
TIED TO A CHAIR?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.550
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:07.590 --> 23:08.760
I'VE HANDLED WORSE.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.600
AND RIGHT NOW,
I PREFER THEIR COMPANY
TO YOURS!

23:15.560 --> 23:17.060
WHAT?

23:17.100 --> 23:18.440
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

23:21.610 --> 23:22.940
[MARTIN] DON'T BE FOOLED
BY ANY OF THIS.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.110
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE.

23:25.150 --> 23:26.530
&lt;HORSES GALLOPING&gt;

23:28.780 --> 23:30.070
ANY WORD FROM ROSE?

23:30.110 --> 23:31.320
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.490
THAT'S FINE BY ME.

23:33.530 --> 23:35.490
LOOK AT THIS.

23:35.540 --> 23:38.460
DES SNAGGED THIS PHOTO
FROM THE SECURITY FOOTAGE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.790
HE SAID HE WAS LOOKING
FOR BRUCE

23:39.830 --> 23:41.250
AND THAT HE WAS AN
INSURANCE ADJUSTER.

23:41.290 --> 23:42.380
HE DOESN'T LOOK IT.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.920
WELL, THAT GIRL THERE
AT THE TICKET WINDOW?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.670
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT LEFT ME
HANGING NAKED.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.630
PLEASE, DON'T EXPLAIN
THAT TO ME.

23:48.670 --> 23:50.550
ANYWAY, SO APPARENTLY,
SHE'S BRUCE'S WIFE.

23:50.590 --> 23:51.970
SHE THOUGHT
I WAS GUNNING FOR HIM.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.970
LET'S SEE IF SHE BACKS UP
THE NUMB-NUTS' STORY.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.430
[MOLLY] WE GOT A WINNER.

23:59.060 --> 24:01.440
HI, THERE.
REMEMBER ME?

24:05.150 --> 24:07.320
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

24:08.570 --> 24:10.610
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE,
OR WHAT YOU WANTED.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.660
BRUCE JUST KEEPS SAYING
SOMEBODY'S AFTER US.

24:12.700 --> 24:13.780
LISTEN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.530
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS
THAT'S TRYING TO KILL
YOUR HUSBAND?

24:16.370 --> 24:17.910
I DON'T KNOW.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.700
HE JUST KEEPS SAYING
THAT SOMEBODY'S AFTER US.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.710
THAT'S WHY
HE HAD ME STASHED
AT THE MOTEL.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.750
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
THAT THERE'S A CONTRACT
ON YOUR HUSBAND'S HEAD,

24:24.790 --> 24:27.800
OR THAT HE'S STEALING MONEY
TO SAVE HIS AILING SISTER?

24:27.840 --> 24:29.380
BRUCE DOESN'T HAVE A SISTER.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.340
ALL RIGHT, UH...

24:33.640 --> 24:35.510
WHERE'D HE GET
THE MASSIVE BAG OF MONEY?

24:35.550 --> 24:36.890
HE HAD A BAG OF MONEY ON HIM?

24:37.600 --> 24:38.810
WHAT ELSE DID HE HAVE?

24:38.850 --> 24:40.930
BESIDES A MASSIVE
BAG OF MONEY?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.020
I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE.

24:42.060 --> 24:43.520
SO, WHERE'D HE GET IT?

24:43.560 --> 24:45.020
&lt;SCOFFS&gt;
DO YOU THINK I'D BE WORKING
AT A PLACE LIKE THIS,

24:45.060 --> 24:47.730
IF I KNEW MY HUSBAND
HAD A TON OF CASH?

24:47.770 --> 24:51.610
I GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK.
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

24:51.650 --> 24:54.860
LISTEN, HAVE A LOOK
AT THIS PHOTO FOR ME,
ALL RIGHT?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.780
HE SHOWED UP AT THE HOSPITAL
LOOKING FOR BRUCE.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.040
-YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?
-NO.

25:04.790 --> 25:07.710
SO, NO SICK SISTER, THEN.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.380
NO, BUT I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

25:09.420 --> 25:11.920
I CAN TELL,
SHE KNOWS THIS GUY.

25:11.970 --> 25:14.970
EITHER WAY,
SOMEONE'S GONNA PAY
FOR HITTING DES.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.810
[MAL] BRUCE?

25:21.850 --> 25:22.980
WALTER?

25:23.020 --> 25:25.150
[WALTER] JAKE? IN HERE!

25:25.190 --> 25:26.610
&lt;BANGING&gt;

25:26.650 --> 25:29.320
-[CALL GIRL] SOMEONE? ANYONE?
-WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

25:31.110 --> 25:32.610
[CALL GIRL] FINALLY!
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.990
[JAKE] BRUCE'S MONEY?

25:40.830 --> 25:43.200
LADIES, I THINK YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY GO NOW.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.330
THAT'S 600 BUCKS.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.840
I THINK THIS ONE'S
GONNA BE ON BRUCE.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.590
UH...

25:52.670 --> 25:54.380
THAT SHOULD ABOUT COVER IT.

25:55.010 --> 25:56.720
CALL AGAIN, WALLY. ANYTIME.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.720
&lt;WHISPERS&gt; OH, MY GOD!

26:05.770 --> 26:07.270
DIDN'T TAKE
HIS MONEY WITH HIM.

26:07.310 --> 26:10.020
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THE CASH,
AND WE'LL GO BACK TO THE HOUSE
AND STASH IT THERE?

26:10.070 --> 26:11.690
[MAL] I HAVEN'T EXACTLY
FILLED YOU IN.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.900
TWO WORDS...

26:14.940 --> 26:16.280
MARTIN POOLE.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.700
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
THE HALF OF IT.

26:18.870 --> 26:22.290
NICE. BUT, HEY,
HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.700
EX'S? EVERYBODY'S GOT ONE.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.120
WELCOME TO THE 21ST CENTURY.

26:27.370 --> 26:28.500
LET'S GO.

26:33.460 --> 26:34.550
OH, HEY!

26:37.260 --> 26:38.550
HOW'RE YOU DOING, BUDDY?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.350
&lt;MUMBLING&gt;

26:43.060 --> 26:44.680
WHAT'S ON THE GO HERE?

26:44.720 --> 26:49.650
OH, THE HOSPITAL CALLED.
DESSY NEEDS PICKING UP.
HE'S BEING RELEASED.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.060
OH, GOOD.
COME ON, JAKE, LET'S GO.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.980
SOMEONE WANT TO TELL ME
WHO THE TIED UP MISSUS IS,
HERE?

26:54.030 --> 26:55.530
OH, SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.570
I'VE BEEN TOLD
TO STAY OUT OF IT,
AND I INTEND TO.

26:57.610 --> 26:58.610
COME ON.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.240
JAKE, COME ON!

27:04.700 --> 27:06.580
&lt;JAKE CLEARS THROAT&gt;

27:10.290 --> 27:11.710
GOTTA LET THIS BREATHE.

27:19.130 --> 27:20.640
WELL, LOOK AT THIS...

27:20.680 --> 27:22.350
HEY, I JUST SAW
JAKE AND MAL PULL AWAY.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.930
&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;

27:23.970 --> 27:25.220
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

27:27.060 --> 27:28.810
MANNA FROM HEAVEN.

27:28.850 --> 27:29.730
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

27:29.770 --> 27:31.600
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

27:31.650 --> 27:32.900
BEAUTIFUL.

27:32.940 --> 27:35.730
[DES] THE SUN'S COMING
FROM SCREEN RIGHT.

27:35.780 --> 27:39.820
AND HER HAIR WAS BLOWING IN
A GENTLE EASTERLY DIRECTION.

27:39.860 --> 27:42.320
THERE'S NO SEA IN
THE BACKGROUND,

27:42.370 --> 27:44.740
AND LOTS OF FRESHLY
PLANTED EVERGREENS,

27:44.780 --> 27:48.410
INDICATING RECENT
STORM DAMAGE.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.540
WISHING WELL PARK!
OF COURSE, SHE'S HIDING
IN PLAIN SIGHT!

27:51.580 --> 27:53.880
-HEY.
-HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

27:53.920 --> 27:56.670
-SO, YOU'RE A FREE MAN.
-YES, YES, I AM.

27:56.710 --> 27:57.760
I MEAN, I AM FREE.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.800
I MEAN, UM...
I'VE DATED BEFORE, OBVIOUSLY,

28:00.840 --> 28:03.090
BUT THERE IS NO
MS. COURTNEY, PER SE.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.550
I MEAN, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.850
JUST SIGN HERE
AND YOU CAN GET DRESSED.

28:06.890 --> 28:08.520
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

28:08.560 --> 28:11.190
OKAY, UH... OKAY, UM...

28:11.730 --> 28:12.770
THAT'S GOOD.

28:12.810 --> 28:14.900
SO, WILL THERE BE
A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT?

28:14.940 --> 28:16.320
BECAUSE I CAN
MAKE HOUSE CALLS?

28:18.570 --> 28:20.110
DES, HURRY UP.

28:20.150 --> 28:22.700
YOUR FATHER'S IN THE CAR,
AND I SWEAR TO GOD
HE'S NOT FIT TO TALK TO.

28:22.740 --> 28:23.740
SURE THING.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.580
THANKS FOR BEING AVAILABLE
TO PICK ME UP, EMPLOYEE.

28:26.620 --> 28:28.910
MY STAFF, THEY'RE VERY LOYAL.
GOOD WORK.

28:28.950 --> 28:30.960
WELL, UM, IT WAS
NICE MEETING YOU,

28:31.000 --> 28:32.870
AND, UM, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.630
THANKS. I AM. THANK YOU.

28:34.670 --> 28:35.750
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.420
BYE.

28:41.590 --> 28:42.800
WHAT?

28:42.840 --> 28:43.800
YOUR EMPLOYEE?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.890
LIKE WE'RE EMPLOYEES TOGETHER.

28:45.930 --> 28:47.810
IT WAS JUST A JOKE,
IT WAS A FUNNY JOKE.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.690
HELLO, KIND SIR.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.820
-CAN I HELP YOU?
-WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

28:58.020 --> 28:59.980
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

29:00.030 --> 29:01.950
LOOK, IF THIS IS ABOUT
A DENTED ESCALADE
ON BOND STREET,

29:01.990 --> 29:03.490
IT WASN'T ME. ALL RIGHT?
I HAD SHAG ALL TO DO WITH IT.

29:03.860 --> 29:04.990
AHHH!

29:05.030 --> 29:07.780
-WHAT B'Y?
-I'M LOOKING FOR
BRUCE MICHAELS.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.370
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM,
HAVE YOU?

29:13.750 --> 29:16.920
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME
RELIVE MY HORROR?

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
NO, I GET IT.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.550
GET RIGHT BACK ON
THE HORSE, RIGHT?

29:19.590 --> 29:22.470
I'M LIVING THROUGH MY FEAR,
I'M LIVING THROUGH MY FEAR.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.220
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE IT EASY, SON,
AND WAIT FOR US OUT HERE.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.970
YEAH,
GO RELIVE THAT FEAR,
OR WHATEVER.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.140
AH, IT'S JUST
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.520
WHY WOULD HE LEAVE
THE MONEY BEHIND
AT THE OFFICE?

29:33.850 --> 29:35.690
[MAL] WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A LOOK IN THE GARAGE?

29:37.900 --> 29:39.940
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SOMEONE'S OUT TO KILL BRUCE?

29:39.980 --> 29:41.570
WELL...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:41.610 --> 29:42.610
I SORT OF WANT TO KILL HIM.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.660
[JAKE] WHAT'S ALL THIS?

29:49.370 --> 29:50.870
[MAL] WHAT'S HE GOT
GOING ON HERE?

29:52.580 --> 29:53.750
PRINTING MONEY.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.040
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS IS?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.920
THAT'S A PRINTING PRESS.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.920
AREN'T THESE THINGS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE,
LIKE, UH, YOU KNOW,

30:03.970 --> 30:04.880
FORGERY PLATES, OR WHATEVER?

30:04.920 --> 30:06.890
THAT'S THE MOST
VALUABLE PART.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.970
SO, THEY'RE NOT HERE.
HE MUST HAVE THEM WITH HIM.

30:09.010 --> 30:11.060
IT EXPLAINS WHY
HE LEFT THE MONEY
BACK AT OUR PLACE.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.850
-TRAVEL LIGHT, PRINT MORE.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

30:16.270 --> 30:17.400
WHAT?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.730
JAKE, YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME,
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

30:19.770 --> 30:20.860
OH, YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.650
&lt;CAR ENGINE SPUTTERS&gt;

30:25.820 --> 30:26.860
IS THAT BRUCE'S CAR?

30:27.950 --> 30:29.070
YEAH, THAT'S BRUCE.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.410
BRUCE?

30:30.450 --> 30:32.740
HEY, JAKE, UH, DID YOU THINK
THAT GIRL AT THE HOSPITAL...

30:32.790 --> 30:34.750
DID SHE SEEM, UH...
DID SHE SEEM NICE TO YOU?

30:34.790 --> 30:36.920
I JUST REALLY
VALUE YOUR OPINION,
ROMANCE-WISE.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.080
SON, HE'S THE LAST ONE
YOU WANT TO TALK TO ABOUT
THAT SUBJECT, TRUST ME.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.000
OH, LISTEN TO HIMSELF.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.340
THE BIG EXPERT
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

30:42.380 --> 30:44.800
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE TO YOUR WIFE,
BY THE WAY?

30:44.840 --> 30:46.840
&lt;DES SINGING&gt;

30:49.220 --> 30:50.640
[JAKE] DES! DES!

30:52.180 --> 30:53.560
&lt;ALL YELLING&gt;

30:59.980 --> 31:01.440
&lt;DES GRUNTING&gt;

31:01.480 --> 31:03.730
OW! OW!

31:03.780 --> 31:05.030
OH, WAIT, A LITTLE LOWER.

31:05.570 --> 31:07.360
LOWER, NO, NO HIGHER...

31:07.400 --> 31:09.950
DES, I HAVE TO STITCH
WHERE THE WOUND IS.

31:10.990 --> 31:12.740
OTHERWISE,
IT'S CALLED "PIERCING."

31:12.780 --> 31:14.080
YEAH.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.330
[LESLIE] I FIGURED IT OUT!

31:15.370 --> 31:17.250
THIS WHOLE THING,
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.

31:17.290 --> 31:19.250
YOU'RE TRYING TO MURDER DES.

31:19.290 --> 31:20.580
WELL, NOT ON PURPOSE.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.790
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY YOU HAD NO FRIENDS.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.050
IT TURNS OUT,
YOU KILLED THEM ALL.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.510
[MAL] SO WHAT ABOUT BRUCE?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.050
IS HE STILL ALIVE,
DID HE MAKE IT?

31:27.090 --> 31:29.430
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY,
UNLESS BRUCE IS MADE
OF PLASTIC,

31:29.470 --> 31:31.640
AND WAS STOLEN FROM
THE WOOLWORTHS
WINDOW DISPLAY,

31:31.680 --> 31:32.850
I'D SAY, HE IS ALL RIGHT.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.390
WHAT, HE PRETENDED
TO BE A MANNEQUIN?

31:35.640 --> 31:40.350
MALACHY,
I KNOW HE'S YOUR SON.
I KNOW THAT.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.190
BUT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,
GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.570
YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE THE WORST
I'VE EVER SEEN

31:53.620 --> 31:54.990
WHEN IT COMES
TO COURTING WOMEN.

31:55.030 --> 31:56.160
IT'S LIKE A REVERSE TALENT.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.080
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

31:59.370 --> 32:02.130
SO, UH, HERE'S HIS NUMBER.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.460
WE'RE TRYING TO MARRY HIM OFF.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.130
THERE WILL BE NO DOWRY.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.760
AH! OW!

32:10.760 --> 32:12.050
SO, WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO LOOK NOW?

32:12.090 --> 32:14.260
WELL, I'M THINKING WORKING
THE WINDOW AT A RACE TRACK

32:14.300 --> 32:16.390
WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE
TO SWITCH OUT COUNTERFEIT.

32:18.310 --> 32:19.770
THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT TOO STUPID.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.230
[ROSE] HEY, HEY, HEY.
THERE IS NO WAY

32:22.270 --> 32:23.980
WE ARE STEALING JAKE
AND MALACHY'S MONEY.

32:24.020 --> 32:25.020
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT STEALING.

32:25.060 --> 32:27.650
WE'RE BORROWING IT,
TO PAY OFF A MUTUAL DEBT.

32:27.690 --> 32:28.780
MUTUAL? REALLY?

32:28.820 --> 32:30.320
-THAT'S RIGHT.
-NO, NO, NO.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.740
YOU LEAVE THAT MONEY ALONE,
UNTIL I KNOW WHAT MALACHY'S
DOING WITH IT.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.120
OKAY.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.280
ALL RIGHT.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.660
DON'T GET EXCITED.

32:36.700 --> 32:39.500
CAN'T WE JUST ASK MALACHY
IF WE CAN BORROW...

32:39.540 --> 32:41.710
-A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN K?
-&lt;GASPS&gt;

32:41.750 --> 32:44.000
WOULD THAT DO IT,
OR MAYBE THE WHOLE BAG?

32:44.040 --> 32:46.590
MARTIN, I TOLD YOU
TO KEEP CHECKING HER KNOTS.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.090
I THOUGHT I DID.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.470
JUST, STEADY NOW, FRANNY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURT HER.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.880
OH WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE WHOLE BAG,

32:52.930 --> 32:55.010
WILL MAYBE COVER THE CRACK
YOU GAVE ME ON MY HEAD, ROSIE.

32:56.180 --> 32:59.100
THIS IS COUNTERFEIT.
IT'S GOOD COUNTERFEIT, THOUGH.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.390
-COUNTERFEIT?
-SHE'S GOT A GOOD EYE.

33:01.430 --> 33:05.770
LET'S JUST SAY,
A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE
SHOULD COVER OUR DEBT.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.070
AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

33:08.270 --> 33:09.860
WAIT, AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE
THE SMART ONE?

33:10.360 --> 33:12.150
THINK OF SOMETHING.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.400
&lt;HORSES GALLOPING&gt;

33:13.450 --> 33:14.860
[MAL] MOLLY ISN'T HERE.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.620
-GOD KNOWS WHERE
HER AND BRUCE MIGHT BE.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

33:18.080 --> 33:19.290
[MOLLY] JAKE.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.080
MOLLY, HOW NICE
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.160
PUT BRUCE ON THE PHONE.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.370
[MOLLY] HOLD ON.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.250
JAKE, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

33:28.290 --> 33:30.590
OH, SO IT WASN'T YOU
WHO STUCK A MANNEQUIN IN A CAR

33:30.630 --> 33:33.220
AND BLEW IT UP
THINKING THAT WE'D BELIEVE
IT WAS YOUR DEAD BODY.

33:33.260 --> 33:35.930
WHERE ARE THE PLATES?
WE WANT TO MEET YOU NOW.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.640
OKAY. OKAY I'LL MEET YOU.
I'LL SEND YOU AN ADDRESS.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.770
GOOD. SEND THE ADDRESS.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.930
-HE SAYS HE'LL MEET?
-IT'S A TRAP, DO YOU THINK?

33:42.980 --> 33:44.440
OH YEAH, IT'S A TRAP.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.810
HA, HA. IT'S THAT PI.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.820
GOOD NEWS.
HE FOUND YOUR PLATES,
AND HE'S BRINGING THEM HERE.

33:49.860 --> 33:52.280
WELL, YOU'D BETTER HOPE
HE'S NOT LYING.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.900
HE'S GOING TO TEXT ME
THE ADDRESS, THEN.

33:53.950 --> 33:55.570
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

33:55.610 --> 33:57.700
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-WE TURN HIM IN,
CALL IT A DAY?

33:57.740 --> 33:59.280
IS THAT ROSE CALLING?

33:59.330 --> 34:00.450
IF I WAS YOU, I'D ANSWER IT,

34:00.490 --> 34:01.830
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.380
ROSE? ROSE? I LOVE YOU,

34:07.420 --> 34:09.130
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW IT'S FOOLISH,

34:09.790 --> 34:11.090
BUT EVERY TIME
MARTIN SHOWS UP,

34:11.130 --> 34:12.880
I ALWAYS FEEL SOMETHING BAD
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.510
[ROSE] MAL, LISTEN TO ME.

34:14.550 --> 34:17.840
FRANCES WANTS IN ON
THE COUNTERFEITING RING,
OR SHE'S GOING TO KILL ME.

34:19.430 --> 34:20.930
THINK SHE MIGHT
TAKE THE PLATES?

34:20.970 --> 34:22.060
EVEN BETTER.

34:23.430 --> 34:26.270
WE GOTTA WALK INTO THAT TRAP,
OR ROSE IS DEAD.

34:34.650 --> 34:36.280
RIGHT. WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

34:37.860 --> 34:41.530
YOU MUST BE ARNOLD, RIGHT?
I HEARD YOU WERE IN TOWN.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.200
I SEE YOU'VE MET
THE LOVELY COUPLE.

34:43.240 --> 34:46.080
SHUT UP.
JUST GIVE ME THE PLATES,
OR I'LL KILL THE LOT OF YOU.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.790
ARNOLD, BUDDY,
I DON'T HAVE THE PLATES.
ALL RIGHT?

34:47.830 --> 34:49.080
THIS NIMROD DOES.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.630
IN FACT,
I'M PRETTY SURE
THIS IS THE NIMROD

34:50.670 --> 34:52.300
WHO STOLE THEM FROM YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.250
[MOLLY] I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
FOR A SECOND.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.550
WELL THAT REALLY HURTS
MY FEELINGS.

34:54.590 --> 34:56.050
[BRUCE]
ARNIE, YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

34:56.090 --> 34:58.260
I WAS KEEPING THE PLATES SAFE
UNTIL I COULD GIVE THEM BACK
TO YOU,

34:58.300 --> 35:00.550
AND HE STOLE THEM
FROM THE HOUSE,

35:00.600 --> 35:02.470
AND THEN HE RAN OVER
A LITTLE BOY, I SAW IT.

35:02.510 --> 35:04.770
WHOA, WHOA.
I RAN HIM OVER?

35:04.810 --> 35:08.100
LOOK, I'M NOT AN IDIOT, OKAY?
I KNEW THIS WAS A SET UP.
I JUST CAME HERE...

35:08.140 --> 35:09.230
YOU'RE A MURDERER
AND A THIEF,

35:09.270 --> 35:10.440
SO JUST GIVE US THE PLATES.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.320
ARNOLD, LOOK AT ME.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.610
I DON'T HAVE THE PLATES,

35:14.650 --> 35:15.860
BUT I DON'T CARE
HOW BIG YOU ARE.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.030
WHEN I LEAVE HERE,
I'M GONNA...

35:17.650 --> 35:18.910
OW!

35:18.950 --> 35:21.410
-&lt;PORCELAIN SHATTERS&gt;
-[MOLLY] OH, GOD!

35:22.490 --> 35:23.700
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

35:23.740 --> 35:25.370
THOSE BATHROOMS.
SMALL WINDOWS.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.370
[JAKE] ALL RIGHT, BRUCE.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.370
YOU ARE REALLY STARTING
TO GET ON MY NERVES.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.750
OKAY, THIS IS GUT CHECK TIME.

35:32.790 --> 35:35.460
OKAY? YOU HAVE TO
DO THE RIGHT THING,

35:35.500 --> 35:37.920
SHOW YOUR WIFE
WHAT KIND OF MAN
YOU REALLY ARE.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.220
&lt;SCREAMS&gt;

35:42.680 --> 35:43.970
OW, B'Y!

35:44.560 --> 35:45.890
OKAY, I'LL FOLLOW.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.890
YOU SET UP THE SWAP.
CALL ROSE.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.310
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE LEFT ME LIKE THAT.

35:52.810 --> 35:54.190
&lt;SIGHS&gt; BRUCE!

35:55.440 --> 35:56.820
OBVIOUSLY,
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TIE YOU UP.

35:56.860 --> 35:57.900
&lt;GUN COCKING&gt;

35:58.570 --> 36:00.200
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.030
THINK YOU SHOULD GET
UNDRESSED THIS TIME?

36:11.370 --> 36:12.420
OH, MY GOD!

36:13.460 --> 36:15.210
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY HERE!

36:15.250 --> 36:17.420
EVEN WHEN I KNEW IT,
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT!

36:17.460 --> 36:18.260
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.470
PLEASE DON'T.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.630
JAKE'S GONNA KILL YOU,
AND THEN HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.340
AND THEN MAL'S GONNA KILL ME.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.760
WHY AREN'T YOU IN LONDON?

36:24.800 --> 36:27.310
MAYBE YOU CAN STILL GO BACK,
THAT WAY WE DON'T HAVE TO DIE
SO YOUNG.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.230
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.
THIS IS A DILEMMA.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.640
YOU'RE OVER-HEATING.

36:30.690 --> 36:33.940
JUST SIT BACK DOWN
AND CALM DOWN.

36:35.230 --> 36:36.570
DID YOU TELL ANYONE
I WAS HERE?

36:36.610 --> 36:37.860
NO.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.190
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HOME?

36:39.240 --> 36:41.360
I NEVER LEFT.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.990
ALL THIS TIME
I'VE BEEN PINING FOR YOU,

36:43.030 --> 36:44.530
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN ACROSS AN OCEAN?

36:44.570 --> 36:46.280
YOU WERE PINING?

36:46.330 --> 36:49.330
IT JUST HAPPENS SOMETIMES.
IT'S A REFLEX.

36:49.370 --> 36:52.370
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE
YOU FOUND ME HERE.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.170
I CALLED YOU FROM THE AIRPORT
AND YOU JUST GAVE ME A LIFT
INTO TOWN.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.170
GREAT. SURE. YEAH.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.260
IT'LL BE A SECRET
FOR US TO SHARE.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.420
SECRETLY.

37:00.460 --> 37:01.720
-SURE.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

37:01.760 --> 37:02.880
OH, I HOPE THAT'S NOT JAKE.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.850
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

37:06.260 --> 37:07.260
OH!

37:07.300 --> 37:08.350
OH... UH...

37:08.390 --> 37:10.140
-WHO'S CHANDRA?
-NOBODY.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.560
I MEAN,
SHE'S SOMEBODY,
OBVIOUSLY.

37:12.390 --> 37:15.400
SHE'S A PERSON,
BUT SHE'S LIKE A FRIEND.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.610
WHATEVER.

37:16.650 --> 37:17.860
SHE DIDN'T TOUCH MY BUM.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.280
OKAY.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.700
DES, JUST KEEP YOUR
MOUTH SHUT, OKAY?

37:22.740 --> 37:23.820
OKAY.

37:26.030 --> 37:27.030
&lt;DES EXHALES&gt;

37:32.910 --> 37:34.750
HE CAME STRAIGHT HERE.

37:34.790 --> 37:36.420
[JAKE] OH, HE MUST HAVE
STASHED THE PLATES

37:36.460 --> 37:38.460
WHEN HE WAS GETTING
HIS WINDSHIELD FIXED.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.420
LISTEN, I SPOKE TO FRANCES.

37:40.460 --> 37:41.920
SHE'S GOING TO
BRING ROSE HERE.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.050
GOOD.
LET'S HOPE WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO TRADE.

37:48.510 --> 37:49.760
OH!

37:51.310 --> 37:52.480
GIVE US IT.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.730
YOU CAN'T TAKE THEM.

37:53.770 --> 37:56.190
YOU REMEMBER MY SISTER?
SHE TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE!

37:56.230 --> 37:57.440
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-YEAH, RIGHT.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.820
IT'S MOLLY.

38:02.860 --> 38:04.110
JAKE, HE'S GOT ME.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.490
[ARNOLD] HERE.

38:06.530 --> 38:07.820
OKAY, JUST STAY CALM, MOL...

38:07.870 --> 38:10.450
YOU GET ME THOSE PLATES,
OR I DELIVER HER IN PIECES.

38:10.490 --> 38:13.950
ALL RIGHT, RELAX.
DON'T KILL ANYBODY, OKAY?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.370
ARNOLD'S GONNA KILL MOLLY,
IF WE DON'T GIVE HIM
THE PLATES.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.250
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE NEED THESE PLATES FOR ROSE.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.380
WE GOTTA SAVE MOLLY!

38:21.420 --> 38:23.260
GIVE HIM THE PLATES,
GIVE HIM ANYTHING,
I DON'T CARE.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.470
JAKE, I LOVE HER.

38:26.380 --> 38:27.590
JAKE, SHE'S ALL I GOT.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.930
WELL LOOK AT THAT.

38:28.970 --> 38:33.680
SOMEWHERE INSIDE YOU
THERE'S A TINY,
LITTLE CON-MAN HEART.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.140
NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.480
JUST RELAX.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.150
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.120
OH, WELL, HERE WE ARE.
LOOK AT THAT.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.960
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY REUNION.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.500
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS, MAL,
REALLY.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.210
NO, IT'S TOTALLY MY FAULT.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.130
WE'LL SETTLE UP LATER,
BOTH OF YOU.

39:02.170 --> 39:03.170
OH.

39:05.630 --> 39:07.510
AND LOOK AT OUR OTHER
HAPPY PRIZE WINNERS.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.340
-BRUCE.
-MOLLY!

39:10.390 --> 39:11.470
[MOLLY] I'M SO SORRY.

39:11.510 --> 39:12.430
WE SHOULD HAVE RUN.

39:12.470 --> 39:14.430
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA SPLIT
THE MONEY WITH YOU.

39:14.470 --> 39:15.600
I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE
OTHER JOKERS ARE,

39:15.640 --> 39:17.060
BUT WHAT'S MINE IS MINE.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.440
AH, TAKE IT EASY THERE, COCKY.

39:19.480 --> 39:22.230
ONE FALSE MOVE
AND I SWEAR YOU'LL BE
PICKING UP THESE PLATES

39:22.270 --> 39:23.320
FROM NOW UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.400
DON'T TRY IT.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.150
-WHO THE HELL IS SHE?
-WHO AM I?

39:26.610 --> 39:28.400
WHO ARE YOU?

39:28.450 --> 39:30.200
WELL, THE DETAILS
ARE KIND OF SCANTY ON THAT,

39:30.240 --> 39:32.620
BUT, UH, SHE'S HERE
FOR YOUR PLATES.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.990
ARNOLD, DON'T HURT HER.
I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING!

39:35.040 --> 39:36.250
LIKE MY OWN PLATES BACK?

39:36.290 --> 39:37.620
SURE.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.500
WAIT!
EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UP,
SO I CAN CONCENTRATE.

39:39.540 --> 39:40.670
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:40.710 --> 39:41.920
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,

39:41.960 --> 39:43.380
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU OWNED UP TO IT.

39:43.420 --> 39:45.050
SERIOUSLY, WE'RE BACK
TO THIS AGAIN?

39:45.090 --> 39:47.340
IF YOU HADN'T GONE TO JOGGING
WITH THAT FRIEND OF YOURS...

39:47.380 --> 39:49.130
YOU CAN NEVER HANDLE
ANYTHING YOURSELF!

39:49.180 --> 39:50.380
I TOLD YOU,
YOU CAN'T TRUST A MAN.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.390
IT'S NOT JUST MEN
YOU CAN'T TRUST, FRANCES.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.680
THAT'S MY GIRL.

39:58.850 --> 40:00.440
&lt;GUN SHOT ECHOES&gt;

40:00.810 --> 40:02.270
DROP IT.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.570
YOU! BRING ME THE PLATES.

40:05.610 --> 40:07.820
JUST HOLD ON, UH...

40:09.110 --> 40:11.910
YOU WIN.
NOW DON'T GO GETTING
ON LIKE THAT NOW.

40:11.950 --> 40:14.580
YOU JUST COME ON FORWARD
AND YOU TAKE THOSE PLATES.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.870
JUST DON'T HURT HER.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.330
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
TO WORRY THERE.

40:20.290 --> 40:21.290
WOW.

40:21.790 --> 40:24.460
I AM SO SORRY, DARLING.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.460
I DIDN'T PLAN FOR IT
TO BE THIS WAY.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.670
PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.340
MOLLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.630
BESIDES THE FACT THAT YOU
BAIL ON ME AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF TROUBLE?

40:32.890 --> 40:34.430
I JUST PICKED A BETTER HORSE.

40:35.510 --> 40:36.640
WELL THE RACE AIN'T OVER YET.

40:37.970 --> 40:39.020
OH, I THINK IT IS, MY FRIEND.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.480
&lt;ELECTRICITY CRACKLING&gt;

40:51.780 --> 40:54.240
YOU HOOKED IT UP
SO THAT WHOEVER
TOUCHED IT FIRST

40:54.280 --> 40:55.660
GOT ZAPPED. NICE!

40:55.700 --> 40:56.660
NOT AS NICE
AS THAT HEAD BUTT.

40:56.700 --> 40:57.870
OH, THANK YOU, DARLING.

41:01.580 --> 41:03.790
SHE WAS KIND OF WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE, ANYWAY.

41:04.330 --> 41:05.460
&lt;MOLLY GROANING&gt;

41:09.920 --> 41:11.170
[LESLIE] DOYLE!

41:13.130 --> 41:14.260
JAKE.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.470
I KNOW, I KNOW.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.600
I'M A HUGE JERK.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.560
I ONLY DELIVERED YOU
A COUNTERFEIT RING,

41:21.600 --> 41:24.900
SOME COUNTERFEIT PLATES,
AND A WANTED FELON
ON A SILVER PLATTER.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.690
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SUE ME.

41:26.730 --> 41:28.820
SURE, YOU SOLVED THE CASE.
GOOD FOR YOU.

41:28.860 --> 41:31.070
EVEN THOUGH YOU IGNORED
EVERY SINGLE THING I TOLD YOU.

41:31.110 --> 41:32.530
BUT WHO CARES, RIGHT?

41:32.570 --> 41:34.910
THANKS AGAIN
FOR THE UNWANTED HELP.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.570
ARE YOU PISSED
BECAUSE I'M NOT NAKED AGAIN,

41:36.620 --> 41:38.740
BECAUSE I KNOW A WAY
THAT WE CAN FIX THAT.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.700
YOU TAKE THESE RISKS,

41:41.750 --> 41:45.250
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SOMEBODY REALLY
GETS HURT.

41:45.290 --> 41:47.250
THEN YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO IS GONNA HAVE
TO LIVE WITH IT.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.760
I'M PRETTY SURE SOMEBODY
BACKED INTO THIS EARLIER.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.430
IT WASN'T ME THOUGH.
I WASN'T ANYWHERE HANDY TO IT.

41:58.220 --> 42:00.310
IS THIS FROM MY CAR?

42:00.350 --> 42:01.770
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE IT
HERE OVER NIGHT,

42:01.810 --> 42:03.600
I CAN HAVE SOMEONE TRY
AND FIX IT FOR YOU.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.230
IT'LL BE, LIKE,
100 BUCKS, TOPS.

42:05.770 --> 42:07.270
OR 150.

42:07.310 --> 42:09.650
PROBABLY 200.
THERE'S TAX ON THAT, TOO.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.320
[MAL] TO US.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.620
TO NEVER BEING APART AGAIN.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.120
-&lt;GLASSES CLINKING&gt;
-IT'S THE WAY YOU COMMUNICATE.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.620
THAT'S WHAT IMPRESSED ME.

42:22.660 --> 42:25.120
IT'S THAT
WORDLESS COMMUNICATION,
YOU KNOW?

42:25.160 --> 42:26.920
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT IT!

42:26.960 --> 42:30.000
SYNCHRONICITY OR SOMETHING?
SYNCH... SOMETHING.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.090
ANYWAY, BACK AT
THE GARAGE, WOW!

42:32.130 --> 42:33.300
MARTIN, I THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD...

42:33.340 --> 42:34.840
NO, NO, NO.
LET THE MAN FINISH.

42:36.840 --> 42:40.430
AND THEN YOU KIND OF COME UP
WITH THE JACKIE CHAN MOVES,
OR WHATEVER...

42:42.560 --> 42:44.220
OH, BOY.

42:44.270 --> 42:45.680
-YOU DIDN'T.
-OH, YEAH.

42:45.810 --> 42:46.850
OH...

42:47.440 --> 42:48.520
YOU DRUGGED HIM?

42:48.560 --> 42:50.690
YUP. HE DESERVED IT.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.200
WE'LL SEND HIM PACKING
IN THE MORNING.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.360
PINT?

42:58.910 --> 43:00.240
YEAH.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.170
WHAT A DAY.

43:08.830 --> 43:10.790
-CHEERS.
-YEAH, CHEERS.

43:10.830 --> 43:12.040
&lt;GLASSES CLINKING&gt;

43:14.880 --> 43:16.880
WHERE'S DES? IS HE OKAY?

43:16.920 --> 43:18.470
HE'S STANDING
RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
ACTUALLY.

43:20.510 --> 43:21.760
HEY.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.430
UM...

43:26.930 --> 43:28.640
HEY, GUYS. I'M HOME.

43:29.810 --> 43:30.900
TINNY?
