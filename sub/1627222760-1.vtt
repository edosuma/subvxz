03:57.542 --> 03:59.042
Hiya, Michael.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.375
You OK?

04:06.375 --> 04:08.792
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.583
You been a good boy?
Huh?

04:15.250 --> 04:17.166
Hiya, Deirdre.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.791
He's been very quiet.

04:18.916 --> 04:23.250
As good as gold really,
but didn't want to finish his tea.

04:23.375 --> 04:25.375
Why didn't you eat
what Deirdre gave you, huh?

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
I was waiting for you.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.583
Here. Sit down here.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.667
Mmm?

04:35.792 --> 04:37.708
Sure. I'll get that.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.542
I hope I put everything
where you like it.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.500
Anyway, you can let me know
next time.

04:43.625 --> 04:47.458
Social Services said they want me
to come again next week.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.167
Cheers.
Er... I'm sure it's grand.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.625
Well, that's me.

04:54.750 --> 04:58.750
Bye, Michael.
And don't tire your dad.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.958
- Michael?
- Bye.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.250
Thank you, Deirdre.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.833
No problem.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.333
Can we play now?

05:13.458 --> 05:15.125
Aye.

05:15.250 --> 05:18.500
Shall we have some grapes first?
Yeah?

05:20.417 --> 05:21.500
OK.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.750
Five.

05:46.208 --> 05:49.542
Someone at school
is not washing their hair.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.417
Five.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.250
"'Come down, come down,'
his father cried.

05:58.375 --> 06:01.958
"'You'll be much safer by my side.'"

06:02.750 --> 06:04.250
Page.

06:07.167 --> 06:14.167
"But then the crowd below cheered loud
to see a turtle touch a cloud.

06:14.292 --> 06:18.042
"They'd never seen a boy so brave.

06:18.167 --> 06:21.333
"He gave his dad a little wave."

06:21.458 --> 06:22.875
Page.

06:26.208 --> 06:29.042
"And when he reached the other side

06:29.167 --> 06:32.917
"his father's heart was full of pride.

06:33.917 --> 06:37.042
"'Come look,' he called to everyone.

06:37.167 --> 06:41.083
"'That tightrope turtle...
that's my son.'"

06:41.208 --> 06:42.708
Again.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.000
Come on, Michael, it's late.
It's bedtime.

06:56.875 --> 07:02.708
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

07:04.125 --> 07:09.750
May God guard me through the night
and wake me with the morning light.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.708
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.167
Good night, Michael.

08:34.625 --> 08:37.875
Listen, Sam's mummy
will pick you up from school.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.250
You can take his puppy
for a walk.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.417
I want a puppy.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.875
Please don't play with the food.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.375
I'll get you some Coco Pops tomorrow.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.500
And just try and finish the orange juice.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.792
- Thank you so much.
- Hello, Owen.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.542
Good morning, Miss Rose.

10:24.667 --> 10:28.917
Have fun, Michael,
and pay attention to Miss Rose.

10:29.958 --> 10:34.208
- Bye, Mummy.
- Bye now, boys. See you later.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.167
- Bye.
- Bye, chicken. See you later.

10:37.292 --> 10:39.458
Where's my mummy?

10:43.167 --> 10:46.333
I've told you, Michael,
she had to go away.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.708
Far, far away?

10:48.833 --> 10:50.250
Yes.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.500
Far, far away.

10:56.042 --> 10:57.458
Kiss.

11:02.292 --> 11:03.792
Hi, Michael.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.542
See you in there.

11:18.125 --> 11:21.292
I'm sure she'll love that.
Have you put the books in your bag?

11:21.417 --> 11:22.583
Yes, Mummy.

11:27.292 --> 11:29.875
Yeah, the commute
can be difficult sometimes,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.750
but it's worth it though
when you come back to this every night.

11:33.875 --> 11:36.917
Peace and quiet,
surrounded by greenery.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.083
Does he like nature?

11:40.542 --> 11:43.042
We're very outdoorsy people.

11:43.167 --> 11:46.208
We like to go for long walks,
as you can see.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
We were thinking
about maybe getting a dog?

11:53.292 --> 11:57.375
I know Michael would love a puppy,
to be responsible for.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.750
That's great.

11:58.875 --> 12:02.042
We sort of hope the boy would enjoy
the same childhood as ourselves,

12:02.167 --> 12:04.000
not just inside on the computer all day.

12:04.125 --> 12:08.125
And here he's free to run around,
not be mollycoddled,

12:08.250 --> 12:10.792
free to climb trees
and fall out of trees.

12:11.625 --> 12:15.042
I mean, we will look after him obviously,
but you know what I mean.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.292
No, I'm... I'm sure he'll love
to climb trees.

12:19.542 --> 12:23.625
He's a... he's a quiet wee boy,
but he listens and he's always well-behaved.

12:23.750 --> 12:28.750
He's very popular at school.
I'm always being told what a great kid he is.

12:29.542 --> 12:32.292
He's loving... caring.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.667
He... he's a happy wee boy.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.208
I, er... I want...

12:45.250 --> 12:51.583
He deserves a normal family,
two parents, a loving family home

12:51.708 --> 12:54.042
and all the opportunities
I never had as a child.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.417
Oh!

12:57.542 --> 12:58.958
You bang your head?
Are you all right?

12:59.083 --> 13:01.667
- I'm all right.
- You sure?

13:01.792 --> 13:04.958
I want him to be able to do
all the things I never could.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.417
Never even thought of.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.542
We understand that.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.167
We've painted one of the rooms blue,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.708
but if he didn't like it,
we could always change it.

13:14.833 --> 13:17.500
And, of course, we can afford
the best education for our son.

13:19.583 --> 13:21.417
I mean, your son.

13:22.667 --> 13:26.667
As you know, Celia's a nursery teacher.
We could get him into her school.

13:26.792 --> 13:29.708
And perhaps later on, he could attend
my own boarding school.

13:29.833 --> 13:32.542
They're very keen
on having children of alumni.

13:33.458 --> 13:39.125
Well, yeah, but, er...
he's doing well where he is.

13:39.250 --> 13:43.000
And, er... you know, it's not far.
He's got friends, so...

13:43.125 --> 13:46.625
Oh, of course.
We... we'd follow your guidance.

13:47.792 --> 13:49.625
And what does he know
of your situation?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.667
Nothing.
The less he knows the better.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.667
And the birth mother?

13:56.792 --> 13:58.792
There is no birth mother.

13:59.833 --> 14:02.375
Can you see?
Can you see the bugs?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.333
Can you see the bugs in there?

14:06.167 --> 14:08.000
What about in the future,

14:08.125 --> 14:11.042
what would you like your son
to know about you?

14:11.167 --> 14:12.833
To remember?

14:14.375 --> 14:18.542
What would you like your...
the new family to...?

14:23.875 --> 14:25.875
I'm a window cleaner.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.750
One, two, three,

14:28.875 --> 14:31.958
six, seven, twelve,
fifteen, fourteen.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.458
Just think, Michael,
all those lorries,

14:56.583 --> 14:59.583
taking so many things
to so many places.

15:00.167 --> 15:04.667
And all those cars
with people going to work,

15:04.792 --> 15:07.792
or to see their friends, far away.

15:10.083 --> 15:15.000
One day, Michael, would you like
to live somewhere else,

15:15.125 --> 15:17.958
in a different town,
a different home?

15:19.458 --> 15:21.292
I like home.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.583
I don't want him
to think about it...

16:46.333 --> 16:48.750
...to understand death.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.708
Not now, not yet.

16:53.542 --> 16:56.208
He's... he's just too young.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.208
He'll think it'll happen again,

16:59.333 --> 17:02.667
to his new family,
all those around him.

17:05.041 --> 17:09.208
He'll be left thinking that he will die, too.
I mean, you know...

17:10.250 --> 17:11.833
What kind of childhood is that?

17:11.958 --> 17:15.208
John, a memory box is different.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.333
He won't need one now,
but he will need it

17:18.458 --> 17:20.416
and his new parents will too.

17:22.291 --> 17:28.792
You know, John, there might come a time
when he thinks about you every day

17:28.917 --> 17:32.958
and he'll need something to start with,
physical, real,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.000
to connect with and build on.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.875
Build on?

17:39.750 --> 17:42.500
Is that from a manual?
Have you just passed the exam?

17:42.625 --> 17:45.375
John, please.
Shona's right.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.000
Maybe not now, but later.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.625
And certainly when he's eighteen

17:49.750 --> 17:52.167
and he has the right to find out for himself
who his birth parents were.

17:52.292 --> 17:54.958
Why does he have to know
he was adopted?

17:55.083 --> 17:59.500
We will find him a family
that will be his family, his only family.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.125
He won't even have to remember
how useless his parents were.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.083
His mother leaves him
and then his father dies.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.792
I mean, that...
that would definitely fuck him up.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.500
Oh, Michael, it's early.

18:51.708 --> 18:55.542
Michael, I told you not to draw
in the books.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.417
What's Mrs Donnelly at the library
gonna say?

19:37.750 --> 19:41.750
Here, where do we put it?
You choose.

19:41.875 --> 19:45.458
That's good. Let me show you.
Give it a big push.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.458
I'm winning!

21:37.417 --> 21:38.583
Don't you just hate them?

21:38.708 --> 21:41.625
They leave their dogs
in the garden, loose,

21:41.750 --> 21:44.417
but they still expect their mail,
don't they?

21:44.542 --> 21:49.625
And then they complain if something's
late, or God forbid, goes missing.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.917
Them and their bloody dogs.

21:53.042 --> 21:54.792
A menace.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.958
And then, they come at you
and they bite you.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.458
It's like you're their bit of fun
for the day.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.958
- The small ones are the worst, aren't they?
- Mmm.

22:03.708 --> 22:04.792
Look at that, Michael.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.250
Right through my trousers.

22:08.375 --> 22:10.375
Always watch out for dogs, Michael.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.917
You never know
what they feel like biting next.

22:13.042 --> 22:15.042
Michael loves dogs.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.833
He knows a very nice puppy.

22:17.958 --> 22:20.875
Er... would you like
some more cake, John?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It's great, isn't it?
She made it herself.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.375
None of those old preservatives.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.208
Thank you, no.
It was delicious.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.042
Er... Shona, would you?

22:29.167 --> 22:31.250
Oh, thank you, Pam,
I really couldn't.

22:31.958 --> 22:34.958
Michael, would you like
a wee bit more of Pam's cake?

22:36.208 --> 22:37.292
Ah, well...

22:37.417 --> 22:40.833
I'd better have a wee bit more myself then,
before the rabbit gets to it.

22:40.958 --> 22:43.125
Dad, rabbits don't eat cake.

22:43.250 --> 22:46.583
I'm sure Michael knows I'm only joking,
don't you, Michael?

22:48.792 --> 22:51.708
And you've been fostering
for three years now, is that right?

22:51.833 --> 22:55.042
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, but it's been tough, you know?

22:55.167 --> 23:01.917
It's... hard letting go of the idea
of being pregnant.

23:02.042 --> 23:04.042
You know, you want people
to make a fuss over you,

23:04.167 --> 23:07.125
you want to get the...
the baby room ready, you know?

23:07.667 --> 23:11.500
And it lingers in your mind
and you feel this pain

23:12.083 --> 23:15.042
watching other mothers
with their babies.

23:16.292 --> 23:19.875
Every month you feel like you...
you've failed as a woman.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.417
No.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.208
Sorry, John.

23:24.833 --> 23:28.667
I'm sure you know life doesn't always
work out the way you mean it to.

23:33.625 --> 23:38.458
So I thought that maybe I was put on this
earth to look after other people's children.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.917
- And when Anne was... six?
- Seven.

23:41.042 --> 23:43.375
Seven, we started fostering.

23:45.917 --> 23:47.958
How was it for you, Anne?
Did you enjoy?

23:48.083 --> 23:51.583
Oh, she took to it straight away, didn't you?
Didn't you, pet?

23:51.708 --> 23:53.958
Like a duck to water.

23:54.833 --> 23:58.708
But sometimes it's sad to see them go,
you know?

23:59.417 --> 24:01.667
Now we don't want to say goodbye
to any more.

24:01.792 --> 24:05.375
We both made our mistakes,
but we found someone special

24:05.500 --> 24:08.042
and we'll be... we'll be together forever,
won't we?

24:08.167 --> 24:11.083
They're still holding hands when they're
together shopping. It's embarrassing.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.042
That might be somewhat true.

24:14.167 --> 24:15.667
We do nearly everything together.

24:15.792 --> 24:17.958
If I get up in the middle of the night
to go to the bathroom,

24:18.083 --> 24:20.417
she comes with me,
keeps me company.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.042
- So I go for a piss...
- Dad!

24:22.167 --> 24:24.167
Why would you tell them that?
What will they think?

24:24.292 --> 24:26.125
- What, he doesn't piss?
- Dad!

24:26.250 --> 24:28.250
Don't mind him.

24:28.375 --> 24:32.750
Now... look, your child
will be part of a big family.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.958
All good people, real people.

24:36.292 --> 24:40.042
You wanna stick to your own,
people that respect you,

24:40.167 --> 24:42.750
not people who talk down to you.
You know what I mean, John?

24:43.542 --> 24:45.042
I know what you mean.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.500
Postman, sure.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.958
You know, it's...
Nobody writes letters anymore

24:50.083 --> 24:53.250
and I'm sure they're gonna do away
with us pretty soon,

24:53.375 --> 24:57.042
replaced by a flying drone
or something.

24:57.167 --> 25:00.833
And what will all those dogs bite then,
eh, Michael? Eh?

25:22.125 --> 25:24.125
Did you like the rabbit, Michael?

25:28.167 --> 25:30.917
Wouldn't you like a rabbit
to look after?

25:33.042 --> 25:35.125
I want a puppy.

25:55.458 --> 25:56.958
Almost done.

25:57.083 --> 26:00.917
Thank you, Mrs McDonagh.
You really didn't have to go to the trouble.

26:01.042 --> 26:04.042
No trouble.
You need your strength.

26:04.167 --> 26:07.167
And what else would I be doing
with myself?

26:34.750 --> 26:38.167
Here's your special,
just as you like it.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.458
Thank you very much.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.708
Kim.

26:44.833 --> 26:48.083
Here you go. Good girl.

26:50.917 --> 26:53.833
You know, John, these people,
they may be a bit know-it-all,

26:53.958 --> 26:56.458
but they are professionals.

26:59.167 --> 27:02.000
Er... you know,
if they say that you should...

27:02.125 --> 27:04.458
And what am I meant to tell him?

27:05.708 --> 27:10.625
That I'm... in heaven,
sitting next to God?

27:10.750 --> 27:12.333
The same God who did this?

27:12.458 --> 27:18.875
Well... you know,
my mother believed in it, an afterlife.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
But none of your
"dust to dust" stuff for her.

27:23.125 --> 27:27.875
"We are air not earth,"
she would say.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.250
"And we're always there, after.

27:31.375 --> 27:35.792
"Our spirit, our energy,
is in the air."

27:36.875 --> 27:43.708
You know, I used to, er... make fun of her,
of her ideas, when I was young.

27:45.250 --> 27:49.667
But you know, she was right.

27:50.833 --> 27:56.708
And now she comes back to me
in all sorts of ways.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.750
She sits on my bed
at night and we talk.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.917
And she's very peaceful.

28:05.042 --> 28:09.583
I mean, she-she doesn't talk
with her mouth or anything.

28:10.208 --> 28:12.875
But we... but we talk.

28:34.375 --> 28:37.542
- Hi, John. Come on in.
- Hi, Judy. Hello, Grace.

28:37.667 --> 28:40.583
Grace, say hello to Michael's daddy.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.708
Sorry. Come on in.

28:43.833 --> 28:45.333
Good girl.

28:47.833 --> 28:52.083
Er... I am sorry. It hasn't been
the best of playdates.

28:52.208 --> 28:55.375
Michael, your daddy's here.

28:59.083 --> 29:02.250
What are you doing
under the table, Michael?

29:02.375 --> 29:04.708
We didn't feel like playing today.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.083
And we weren't very nice.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.958
We didn't say nice things
to Grace, did we?

29:15.250 --> 29:16.500
Michael?

29:17.792 --> 29:19.625
You're late.

29:22.042 --> 29:23.292
I'm sorry.

29:25.708 --> 29:27.208
Can we go now?

29:35.542 --> 29:39.542
And can you say sorry to Grace and to Judy
for not being nice?

29:39.667 --> 29:40.833
Sorry.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.958
It's OK, Michael.

29:46.375 --> 29:51.042
Don't worry about it.
It must be... difficult.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.833
Cheers, Judy.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.792
And thank you, Grace.

29:58.958 --> 30:00.292
Thank you, Grace.

30:00.417 --> 30:04.417
You are welcome, Michael.
And you come again anytime you want, OK?

30:05.583 --> 30:08.667
- Come on. See you.
- See you at school.

30:17.333 --> 30:20.917
Are we gonna see
any more new friends?

30:24.500 --> 30:26.000
Not today.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.333
Put your belt on.

30:41.292 --> 30:42.792
Daddy.

30:53.292 --> 30:54.958
What is it?

30:55.083 --> 30:57.667
- What did you find?
- It doesn't go.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.833
It's a beetle, Michael.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.958
It's dead.

31:12.083 --> 31:14.167
It can't walk anymore.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.917
Make it go.

31:18.083 --> 31:21.083
I can't. It's dead.

31:24.167 --> 31:27.458
When a beetle dies,
its body doesn't work anymore.

31:28.667 --> 31:33.250
It stops moving.
And eating. And playing.

31:33.375 --> 31:34.875
Why?

31:37.917 --> 31:39.417
Because...

31:43.208 --> 31:48.708
Because like all the animals
and the plants,

31:48.833 --> 31:51.667
all the living things,

31:51.792 --> 31:55.625
it was born
and lived a happy life

31:55.750 --> 31:59.750
and... then it got old
and it died.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.875
And when it died,
it left its body behind,

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
its wee legs, its head,
its tummy, all empty.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.167
But the beetle really
isn't there anymore, it's...

32:11.292 --> 32:13.292
It's just its body.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.458
Is it sad?

32:21.667 --> 32:25.917
No, Michael, it's not sad, it's...

32:27.417 --> 32:30.667
It's... it's just not there.

32:33.208 --> 32:35.875
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream!

33:19.542 --> 33:21.333
Oi!

33:21.458 --> 33:24.125
I'm not paying you to sleep up there.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.250
You missed that corner.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.750
Sir, I haven't started on this one yet.

34:01.333 --> 34:03.083
Don't know what there was
to recommend.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.042
First and last time.
Won't have you around again, mate.

34:06.167 --> 34:08.917
No risk of that.
And I'm not your mate.

34:09.042 --> 34:14.042
Right, just an uppity window cleaner
who can't clean fucking windows.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.625
Hi, Lu.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
See you later.

36:28.417 --> 36:30.250
Sure, you're old enough
to do this yourself.

36:31.375 --> 36:33.208
And without cutting your fingers.

38:19.042 --> 38:23.542
Sometimes the children fight,
hide in their rooms.

38:23.667 --> 38:27.167
Yeah, but then the same child
will skip through the door from school,

38:27.292 --> 38:30.125
you know, clutching a prize
that they've just won for maths

38:30.250 --> 38:32.833
and you know
you've done something right.

38:34.458 --> 38:38.500
I'm so proud of them
and grateful for the privilege

38:38.625 --> 38:41.000
of sharing our lives
with such incredible young people.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.750
Really, Dad, even Tom?

38:42.875 --> 38:46.417
Yes. Even Thomas.
In fact, especially Thomas.

38:48.417 --> 38:52.417
Dad is right. Do you remember
what he was like?

38:52.542 --> 38:56.083
Mum, can we go now?
I'm gonna be late.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.042
Freddy, can you get your stuff together,
please, and put it in the car?

38:59.167 --> 39:02.125
Make sure you don't forget your boots
this time. I'll be there in a minute.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.625
Who put the empty carton
back in the fridge?

39:06.750 --> 39:08.750
Freddy!

39:10.417 --> 39:12.833
Mum, Freddy's taken my boots.

39:12.958 --> 39:15.542
- Mum, I'm late.
- Coming.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.583
I mean, what can I tell you, John?

39:17.708 --> 39:21.000
To me there's no difference
in the way I feel about them.

39:21.708 --> 39:24.625
The birth children
and the adopted ones.

39:24.750 --> 39:29.000
My children are me own
so I love them as me own.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.667
And he'll... he'll be our last one.

39:32.542 --> 39:34.458
Oh, yeah, but if it's God's wish,

39:34.583 --> 39:39.792
then he will be the last one to join
our wee family, so to speak.

39:39.917 --> 39:42.000
And he'll be loved...

39:43.500 --> 39:45.250
...by all of us.

39:46.083 --> 39:48.083
Right, Billy?

39:48.208 --> 39:49.458
Mum!

40:20.125 --> 40:21.625
That's on me.

40:22.708 --> 40:24.208
Cheers.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.833
Come back and do them tomorrow
if you can, or Friday.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.833
Tomorrow.
It should've settled by then.

40:36.917 --> 40:41.000
Another wasted day.
I should've stayed in bed.

40:51.417 --> 40:54.333
I hoped a baby would've made
everything OK,

40:54.458 --> 40:57.125
but, er... six months
after he was born,

40:57.250 --> 41:00.333
she bought a ticket back to Russia
and she left.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.292
She just left.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.250
Didn't even give us
a forwarding address.

41:06.875 --> 41:11.375
Wherever she is, she has no idea
of what she's missed out on

41:11.500 --> 41:14.167
and the lovely wee man
he's grown into.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.750
Well, it wasn't her fault.
She...

41:22.750 --> 41:24.833
Here I just couldn't give her
what she wanted.

41:24.958 --> 41:27.625
She missed her country too much.

41:27.750 --> 41:30.417
The truth is,
I wasn't what she wanted.

41:31.500 --> 41:36.333
But, er... when I was told about,
you know...

41:37.042 --> 41:41.000
...I thought maybe she could,
you know...

41:42.125 --> 41:43.208
...maybe one day...

41:43.333 --> 41:49.250
As Mrs Parkes explained,
it really is too late, John.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.083
Even if we were able
to trace her,

41:51.208 --> 41:54.333
the council would have no way
of assessing the situation

41:54.458 --> 41:56.875
and we couldn't risk
Michael's wellbeing.

41:58.625 --> 41:59.625
John...

42:00.750 --> 42:03.250
One day at a time, yeah?

42:03.375 --> 42:04.458
We'll get there.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.375
Good morning, John.

42:10.375 --> 42:12.792
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

42:18.292 --> 42:19.708
How are you, John?

42:21.125 --> 42:22.708
You tell me.

42:25.125 --> 42:29.917
John, we realise
you want the best for your son.

42:30.042 --> 42:31.833
We all do. Believe me.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.958
And your circumstances
are exceptional.

42:36.458 --> 42:39.708
Which is why we're treating this
in an exceptional way.

42:40.583 --> 42:44.333
But there's a limit to the number of families
we can consider before taking a decision.

42:45.917 --> 42:49.750
This is our responsibility, you understand?
And these are all good families...

42:49.875 --> 42:53.458
I know. I do understand.
But you can't ask me to...

42:53.583 --> 42:55.000
I...

42:56.125 --> 43:00.625
I thought I would, you know, know
when I first saw them.

43:00.750 --> 43:03.500
I thought it would be simple.
No, yes.

43:03.625 --> 43:06.042
Not these. That's them.

43:06.708 --> 43:10.208
But what if I'm wrong?
You know, what if I...

43:11.417 --> 43:13.250
- I need to be sure.
- Of course.

43:13.375 --> 43:16.375
Can't we just put an ad in the paper?
In a frigging shop window?

43:16.500 --> 43:20.667
Because they'd still need to go
through the approval process

43:20.792 --> 43:22.958
and we're running out of time.

44:43.917 --> 44:45.417
She should be fine.

44:45.542 --> 44:47.958
You might want to think about
getting a new set of wheels on her.

44:48.083 --> 44:50.833
But she's, er... she's as good as new.

44:54.042 --> 44:57.542
That's... just for the discs.

44:57.667 --> 44:58.833
Labour's on me.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.333
Thank you.

45:06.542 --> 45:09.042
- Do you like cars, Michael?
- Lorries.

45:09.167 --> 45:13.167
Lorries?
We fix lorries, too.

45:13.292 --> 45:16.042
Maybe you come around some day
and give us a hand, eh?

45:16.167 --> 45:18.000
Would you like to, Michael?

45:19.125 --> 45:20.750
Help George fix some lorries?

45:25.375 --> 45:27.958
- Cheers, George.
- Good luck.

45:32.292 --> 45:35.583
Come on.
We're gonna be late for tea.

45:51.583 --> 45:54.417
Chocolate, chocolate.

45:55.333 --> 45:57.167
Chocolate.

45:57.875 --> 45:59.708
Chocolate.

45:59.833 --> 46:02.667
- Can you see it?
- Chocolate.

46:03.458 --> 46:06.667
- Where is the chocolate powder?
- Chocolate.

46:06.792 --> 46:08.792
Oh, there it is.

46:13.333 --> 46:14.750
Brown or red?

46:14.875 --> 46:17.208
Mmm... red.

46:20.708 --> 46:22.542
Red chocolate.

46:25.667 --> 46:28.417
- Where's the baking powder?
- Baking powder.

46:28.542 --> 46:30.458
- Baking powder?
- Baking powder.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.208
Ah, there it is.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.500
Er...

46:36.042 --> 46:39.792
Michael, maybe we can ask this lady
which is the best baking powder?

46:39.917 --> 46:42.667
- You need baking powder?
- I do.

46:42.792 --> 46:44.458
Is your mummy making you a cake?

46:48.542 --> 46:50.042
No, my daddy.

46:50.833 --> 46:52.625
Lucky boy.

46:55.250 --> 46:56.417
There.

46:56.542 --> 46:58.208
- This one?
- Perfect.

46:58.333 --> 47:00.083
- Great. Cheers.
- Bye.

47:01.375 --> 47:04.167
Michael, you want to put that in?

47:04.292 --> 47:05.375
Good man.

47:05.500 --> 47:08.083
Yeah. Good man.

47:10.667 --> 47:12.083
Grapes.

47:13.708 --> 47:17.042
Aye. Grapes for Michael.

47:18.375 --> 47:20.125
In they go.

47:22.333 --> 47:23.750
OK.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.542
Have we got everything?

47:25.667 --> 47:28.917
That's the question.
Let me check the list.

47:29.042 --> 47:31.042
Er...

47:32.958 --> 47:34.958
- Michael, eggs.
- Eggs.

47:35.083 --> 47:37.250
Eggs. We forgot the eggs.

47:37.375 --> 47:41.208
Where are the eggs?
Shall we go find the eggs?

47:41.333 --> 47:43.792
- Eggs!
- Eggs.

47:43.917 --> 47:48.000
Eggs!

48:01.417 --> 48:02.833
Right!

48:03.875 --> 48:07.458
This is the last packet of candles.

48:08.750 --> 48:09.917
Which colour next?

48:10.042 --> 48:12.375
- Red.
- Red.

48:12.500 --> 48:15.333
OK. Red it is.

48:17.625 --> 48:20.792
Mmm... we are ready to go.

48:21.458 --> 48:24.125
Thirty-three candles.

48:24.250 --> 48:26.000
- Three.
- Three.

48:27.167 --> 48:30.750
Mmm... nearly there.
Which candle next?

48:30.875 --> 48:34.875
- Red.
- Red. Red? Are you sure?

48:35.000 --> 48:38.167
- Red.
- Red. OK.

48:38.292 --> 48:41.292
What a surprise. Red it is.

48:43.750 --> 48:45.167
Ready.

48:45.792 --> 48:49.208
Thirty-four candles on Daddy's cake.

48:49.333 --> 48:51.167
- Four.
- Four.

48:51.292 --> 48:55.875
Thirty-four candles
for thirty-four years.

48:56.958 --> 48:58.917
That's it. We're finished.

48:59.042 --> 49:01.292
What do you think?
It looks good, huh?

49:05.000 --> 49:06.833
You're old.

49:09.208 --> 49:10.708
I'm old?

49:14.458 --> 49:16.292
I'm not that old.

49:18.417 --> 49:23.583
But yes, Michael,
Daddy's not so young anymore.

49:27.708 --> 49:29.708
And one day...

49:43.625 --> 49:45.125
Is this for me?

49:46.375 --> 49:47.875
Thank you.

50:23.500 --> 50:25.750
I am so sorry. I completely forgot
yous were coming.

50:25.875 --> 50:27.708
I've said that already, haven't I?

50:27.833 --> 50:32.083
I mean, I 'm not the tidiest of people,
but the place isn't usually this messy.

50:32.208 --> 50:34.208
I do my washing and ironing
once a week.

50:34.333 --> 50:36.500
I hate doing those half loads, don't you?

50:36.625 --> 50:40.958
Well, with Michael's things,
it feels like all I do is half-loads.

50:41.083 --> 50:44.083
Oh, really?
You know, since Daddy's gone,

50:44.208 --> 50:46.958
I... I just kind of let it build up
and then I'm left with this.

50:47.083 --> 50:48.500
Thank you, Shona.

50:48.625 --> 50:50.958
All right, shall I put the kettle on
and get us a cup of tea?

50:52.417 --> 50:53.583
Aye. Grand.

50:53.708 --> 50:55.375
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.583
Michael, do you want a cup of tea?

50:57.708 --> 51:01.083
Would you... like some juice? No?
Would he like some juice?

51:02.208 --> 51:03.542
OK.

51:03.667 --> 51:06.500
So, John, I don't know how much
you know about my situation.

51:07.625 --> 51:09.125
Well, I'd just turned sixteen

51:09.250 --> 51:12.333
and it was with one of the lads
I worked with back home.

51:12.458 --> 51:15.625
I mean, it was my first time
and, you know, there it was.

51:15.750 --> 51:20.333
Typical. And I loved him. You know,
that sixteen-year-old love for your...

51:20.458 --> 51:21.625
Just a dope.

51:22.375 --> 51:26.542
And then when my ones found out,
well, Jesus, there was uproar.

51:26.667 --> 51:27.750
Daddy was horrified.

51:27.875 --> 51:31.208
He just... he said that there was a doctor
in the next town

51:31.333 --> 51:34.750
and... like, I said, "No way."

51:34.875 --> 51:38.125
And then for me, that...

51:38.250 --> 51:42.167
When it just came time
to, you know, signing those forms...

51:42.292 --> 51:45.542
it just...
I think that I was just so angry.

51:45.667 --> 51:47.750
I was just so angry
with everyone around me

51:47.875 --> 51:50.708
cos I just really wanted
to keep my son.

51:51.792 --> 51:53.500
And I really thought
that I could do it

51:53.625 --> 51:58.208
and I really, really wanted to do it,
like, even back then.

52:01.125 --> 52:02.958
Do you believe me, John?

52:07.458 --> 52:08.875
And I couldn't choose.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.583
I mean, I didn't even meet the parents
that were set to take the baby.

52:14.625 --> 52:17.542
So then all those years later,

52:17.667 --> 52:21.917
the doctor said that I probably
wouldn't be able to carry a baby again.

52:22.042 --> 52:24.125
Like, adoption
was the obvious choice for me

52:24.250 --> 52:28.958
and that was fine cos I would've
just thought that I would love our child

52:29.083 --> 52:32.333
just the way I would have loved
the child I had to give up.

52:37.833 --> 52:40.833
But my husband,
he didn't feel the same.

52:40.958 --> 52:45.542
He just thought that he couldn't
love a baby that wasn't his, you know?

52:45.667 --> 52:49.250
Like, actually his. So...

52:51.500 --> 52:56.083
That was the end of that.
Right, come here, you.

52:56.208 --> 52:57.875
Come here.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.833
Let's see how many rocks
you can fit into the truck.

53:03.208 --> 53:06.625
So it's been, what, three years now
since I've been...

53:06.750 --> 53:08.833
- Two.
- Two.

53:08.958 --> 53:12.208
It's been three years now since
I've been approved and in the system.

53:12.333 --> 53:16.667
You know, sometimes they say that
they're just looking for couples, which is fine,

53:16.792 --> 53:19.625
but that's the first thing I do
when I go on those profiles.

53:19.750 --> 53:22.250
I see if it's OK that I'm single.

53:22.375 --> 53:24.708
I mean, I don't blame them cos...

53:25.667 --> 53:30.625
I think that if I was looking for a family
for my baby, that's what I'd want, you know?

53:30.750 --> 53:35.083
Two people, doesn't matter the colour
or the shape or any of that craic.

53:35.208 --> 53:37.458
Just two people that loved each other.

53:37.583 --> 53:39.083
I think that's important, don't you?

53:40.125 --> 53:42.542
Yeah, yeah. I suppose.

53:45.542 --> 53:47.292
It's hard, you know?

53:48.875 --> 53:53.125
I mean, for me, it's like... it's like
the light at the end of the tunnel

53:53.250 --> 53:55.667
is a child coming into this house.

53:56.500 --> 53:59.667
I would be like... it would be
like winning the cup.

53:59.792 --> 54:02.458
Only it would be way better.

54:03.125 --> 54:04.208
How many did you get in?

54:04.333 --> 54:06.083
Mmm...

54:08.083 --> 54:12.833
I mean, I just...
I just want a child to love, you know?

54:14.083 --> 54:15.667
To give my love to.

54:16.833 --> 54:18.833
What was he like as a baby?

54:20.083 --> 54:26.333
Er... he kept us, er...
well, me really, up all night.

54:28.458 --> 54:31.458
His mother couldn't give him milk
and teething was difficult.

54:33.583 --> 54:36.667
And what were you like
when you were his age?

54:36.792 --> 54:37.792
I don't know.

54:37.917 --> 54:43.750
Er... they told me my dad brought me up
for my first four years.

54:45.083 --> 54:47.083
He was a lorry driver.

54:47.208 --> 54:50.292
Kept the cot
in the back of the cab.

54:50.417 --> 54:52.958
And then after that,
it was foster homes.

54:58.875 --> 55:01.458
Can I ask you something?

55:01.583 --> 55:03.083
What do you like to do
with your dad?

55:03.208 --> 55:04.708
Mmm...

55:06.125 --> 55:11.458
Well, we don't do so much
physical stuff these days, do we?

55:11.583 --> 55:17.667
So we... we read and watch TV,
go to the park.

55:18.958 --> 55:22.958
And sometimes we wash windows,
don't we, Michael?

55:24.625 --> 55:27.958
Do you love washing windows?
Do you love getting wet?

55:28.083 --> 55:29.833
No.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.917
When are you gonna die?

55:46.292 --> 55:47.292
Er...

55:47.417 --> 55:48.833
Jesus.

55:48.958 --> 55:51.792
Well, I don't know, Michael.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.583
I don't think anyone knows.

55:55.708 --> 55:57.958
I hope it's not for ages.

57:01.542 --> 57:04.583
You know,
I used to be so jealous.

57:04.708 --> 57:10.042
I was so envious
of all those who lived on,

57:10.167 --> 57:11.958
all those old people,

57:12.083 --> 57:17.125
and my husband was going to die
and he was still young.

57:18.000 --> 57:24.583
I'd lie awake at night next to him
and... I just got so angry.

57:26.875 --> 57:29.625
But he wasn't like that at all.

57:30.458 --> 57:34.208
He said he enjoyed even more
every minute we spent together,

57:34.333 --> 57:40.250
that everything around him
seemed to be more special, wonderful.

57:41.375 --> 57:43.375
The sun was brighter...

57:44.292 --> 57:48.042
...the colours of the flowers
were richer.

57:48.583 --> 57:51.375
Even the grass was greener.

57:52.333 --> 57:55.000
I'm not sure I know
what he was on about.

57:55.125 --> 57:58.958
Maybe he said it
just to make me feel better.

58:01.375 --> 58:05.958
All I see is death, always there.
Everywhere.

58:09.125 --> 58:12.625
Like some bloke hanging around
who wants something.

58:15.083 --> 58:17.417
Never show weakness
is how I grew up.

58:17.542 --> 58:21.708
You showed weakness
in one of those places, you were screwed.

58:21.833 --> 58:23.917
That's how I lived my whole life.

58:26.875 --> 58:28.708
But sometimes...

58:29.958 --> 58:32.375
...when I drop him off at school,

58:32.500 --> 58:34.958
there's all those mums there
with their kids...

58:36.042 --> 58:38.708
...the tears well up.

58:39.875 --> 58:41.208
And there's nothing I can do,

58:41.333 --> 58:44.083
just turn around, walk away
and hope that nobody sees,

58:44.208 --> 58:48.333
nobody... nobody comes over
and tries to help.

58:48.875 --> 58:52.792
That's not weakness, angel,
that's love.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.833
Yeah, but how can I do
this to him?

58:58.875 --> 59:01.792
I've given him a family
and now I'm taking it away.

59:01.917 --> 59:05.083
You are doing something very brave.

59:05.208 --> 59:09.000
You should be dead proud
of what you're doing for him.

59:10.708 --> 59:12.958
I'm sorry, I mean...

59:15.958 --> 59:18.958
It's funny how you can rot inside
and not even know it.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.500
I know.

59:28.750 --> 59:30.750
Do you still miss him?

59:33.000 --> 59:35.500
Yes. No.

59:36.708 --> 59:39.208
I talk to him every day.

59:39.333 --> 59:42.667
We had fifty wonderful years together.

59:46.375 --> 59:49.125
Our only sadness was
that we never had children.

59:53.292 --> 59:56.042
I wish I wasn't so old
I could do this for you.

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:09.458
I finally threw out his toothbrush
last Christmas.

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:10.542
Come here.

01:02:22.208 --> 01:02:24.625
We don't have to adopt.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.875
I'm... I'm sure my husband and I
are perfectly capable

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.750
of bringing a lovely baby
into the world,

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:32.208
but it's just not our choice.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:37.583
The idea of waddling around
happily expectant

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:42.792
and then bringing a little tiny newborn
home from the hospital

01:02:42.917 --> 01:02:47.250
and closing the door
and... living in a little cocoon,

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:49.375
all away from the world...

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.833
It's just not really me.

01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:55.875
It's just not us, is it, Trevor?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.667
No.

01:02:57.792 --> 01:02:59.458
We-we both feel that...

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:02.250
We like to confront life.

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.708
We like to face things head on.

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:11.042
And for us this would be...
a new journey.

01:03:11.167 --> 01:03:12.500
A whole new adventure.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.042
And we have room in our hearts

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:23.750
and we certainly have plenty of room
in our home, so why would we not?

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:30.292
And if someone needs parents,
then we can be those parents.

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:38.083
That's good.

01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:41.542
I'm, er... glad for you.

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:47.792
Er... do you like him, Michael?

01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:50.375
His name's Jimmy.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.458
Say thank you to Trevor.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:56.417
Thank you.

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:04.542
He doesn't really look like his photo,
does he?

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:07.167
I mean, or you.
Does he look like the mother?

01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:11.917
Aye, he has his mother's eyes.

01:04:14.167 --> 01:04:17.208
I mean, how any mother
can leave a child?

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:21.000
I mean, leaving the father
I can completely understand,

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:22.958
but leaving a child?

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:24.917
A child needs a mother.

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:27.833
Wouldn't you like a mummy, Michael?

01:04:35.458 --> 01:04:37.458
This will have to go.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.833
We jumped the gun a bit.

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.458
Lorraine...

01:04:43.292 --> 01:04:45.458
We were hoping for a baby, but...

01:04:46.458 --> 01:04:48.542
But please... please believe me,
we will love him,

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:51.917
we will, er... we will bring him up
with love.

01:04:53.167 --> 01:04:55.667
Not just for him, but-but for us.

01:04:56.667 --> 01:04:58.333
That will be good.

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:02.917
A life well spent,
something to be proud of.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.833
I mean, after all, what could be better
than helping a child grow up...

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.750
...ready to face life...

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:16.958
...like your parents did for you?

01:05:19.292 --> 01:05:24.167
And to leave this world knowing
that you contributed to something real,

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:29.125
that your passage on this earth
had a purpose...

01:05:30.667 --> 01:05:32.333
...and a meaning.

01:05:34.292 --> 01:05:37.792
Sorry. You have to excuse me.
Sometimes I go on.

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:45.500
And, er... this... this is my room.

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:49.167
Well, it's the train's room, really.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:54.333
Lorraine doesn't understand
why I spend so much time in here.

01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:59.542
But there's always something to do,
something to improve, something to fix.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:05.083
You just have to take the time
to look at it,

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.417
carefully, like a child would.

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:11.417
Do you think Michael would like it?

01:06:13.042 --> 01:06:15.208
He likes lorries...

01:06:16.792 --> 01:06:18.042
...and trains.

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:25.667
- Maybe you could show it to him.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:29.958
When he's older.
It's... it's all a little delicate.

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:41.417
Hello, Daddy.

01:06:41.958 --> 01:06:43.125
OK, huh?

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.833
Well, thank you so much for coming.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:50.792
Michael, it was lovely to meet you.
And you too, John. Real pleasure.

01:06:51.417 --> 01:06:53.083
Yes. Thank you.

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:55.167
Trevor.

01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:08.042
Michael, Jimmy lives here.

01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:12.500
But maybe you could come
and play with him another time?

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.333
Er... Michael, I want you
to say goodbye to Jimmy.

01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:26.875
And thank Trevor for letting you
play with him, OK?

01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:34.208
Thank you for letting me
play with him. Bye.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:36.833
Bye. Bye.

01:07:38.417 --> 01:07:40.917
Good. Come on, let's go.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.708
What's adopt, Daddy?

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:16.582
Adopt is...

01:08:17.417 --> 01:08:20.832
...when a child cannot be looked after
by his mummy and daddy...

01:08:23.417 --> 01:08:29.167
...and so he can go
and live with two nice new parents...

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:35.292
...who can give him
a new loving family home.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.625
I don't want to adopt.

01:09:02.582 --> 01:09:04.417
Don't fall, Michael.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.707
Be careful.

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:19.750
John, these things are done
in a certain way.

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:23.542
There are all sorts of procedures
we're supposed to follow.

01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:25.332
They're not written
for a case like yours.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:29.457
Where did you find those people?
What fucking procedures did you use?

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.832
I'm sorry, John.

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:36.792
But it does happen.

01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:39.457
A lot of matches just don't work out.

01:09:40.582 --> 01:09:42.542
I think they were just hoping
for someone younger.

01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:47.082
I wouldn't have given them a dog
to look after. Not even a fucking rabbit.

01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:52.042
This is the biggest decision of my life.

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:55.000
Don't they understand?
Don't you?

01:09:57.917 --> 01:10:01.333
It's not about me wanting to be right.
It's...

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.417
I do understand.
That's why I'm here.

01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:09.458
I'm breaking loads of rules I know about
and I'm sure a few more that I don't.

01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.083
If Mrs Parkes finds out,

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.958
I'll be asking you for a job
before I finish my training.

01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:19.792
It's not even about them,
figuring them out.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:21.958
It's Michael.

01:10:24.042 --> 01:10:26.708
I always thought that I knew him.

01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.333
I mean, I do. I do.

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:32.750
You know, he's... he's mine.
He's my son.

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:38.750
But do I know him?
Really know him, you know?

01:10:38.875 --> 01:10:42.708
Enough? For this?

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.333
Oh, God. Fuck.

01:10:56.042 --> 01:10:59.083
Where's a drink when you need it?

01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:00.708
Why did you bring me to this place?

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.917
You know what?
I don't know.

01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:10.292
For some cake?

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:18.125
OK, fine.
We'll go to a pub next time.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.917
Have two big vodkas.
And then we'll sort it all out.

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:25.625
Well... if you're allowed.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.250
Allowed?

01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:31.292
It's definitely not gonna kill me.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.708
Do you think you've cleaned
that lorry enough, Michael?

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:48.833
It looks very clean to me.

01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:51.208
No. It's dirty.

01:11:55.042 --> 01:12:00.042
OK, come on, lean your head back.
I don't wanna get soap in your eyes.

01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:01.583
That's it.

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:40.000
No more.

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:44.542
We can tell Miss Rose
they're all gone.

01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:46.750
All dead.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.667
No, don't use my spoon.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:34.958
I told you it's rude.

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:39.833
More.

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:45.708
I'll get you more.
Just please don't eat mine. OK?

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:10.917
No!

01:15:11.042 --> 01:15:13.125
The tiger ones are dirty.
You can't wear them.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.333
We'll wash them tomorrow.
Now it's late.

01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:18.708
Michael, put these on, please.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.333
Michael!

01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:30.667
Michael, put the new pyjamas on now.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.583
And don't come out of here
until you're ready to say sorry.

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:26.208
What are you putting
in that lorry there?

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:29.125
Rocks.

01:20:36.292 --> 01:20:38.792
Yeah, so I've crossed out
all the bad ones.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.167
- Mm-hmm.
- Put a star next to the good ones

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:46.125
and a question mark next to the ones
who, you know, do pay

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.917
but just need a bit of reminding
from time to time.

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:53.083
Here.

01:20:53.208 --> 01:20:55.625
So, if you have any more questions,
you got my number.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.917
- I should be on it for a little wee while.
- Thanks. That's great.

01:20:59.042 --> 01:21:00.292
Are you going abroad?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.417
Aye.

01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:07.625
Oh, here are the keys.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.500
If you look after her,
she shouldn't let you down.

01:21:10.625 --> 01:21:13.375
Brilliant. I will.
I'll let you know how it goes.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.333
Oh, sorry, I almost forgot.

01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:18.208
This is for you. But don't cash it
until next Monday, OK?

01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:20.750
- Cheers.
- Wish me luck!

01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:23.167
Keep her lit.

01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:51.333
Like the beetle... left its body,

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:54.958
but is now flying around the forest...

01:23:57.125 --> 01:23:58.958
...one day soon...

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:03.208
...your daddy will leave his body...

01:24:04.417 --> 01:24:07.750
...but will always be around you

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:09.708
in the air.

01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:15.875
Like the balloon in the sky?

01:24:17.167 --> 01:24:18.667
Yes.

01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:24.708
You won't see me,

01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:28.917
but you can talk to me...
and I'll listen.

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:35.833
And you won't hear me
like you hear me now... but...

01:24:38.417 --> 01:24:41.417
...you'll hear me inside you.

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:45.208
- Inside?
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:50.917
Cos I will always be with you...

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:54.667
...in the air around you...

01:24:56.458 --> 01:25:00.875
...and in the sunshine
that warms you.

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:03.500
And the rain?

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:09.583
Aye... and the rain
that gets you wet.

01:25:10.417 --> 01:25:12.500
And the grapes?

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.208
Yes.

01:25:18.792 --> 01:25:21.375
I'll be there too.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.833
Not in the grape,

01:25:24.958 --> 01:25:27.292
but in the taste of it.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.917
Mmm?

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:31.917
Hi, John.

01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:37.583
Hi, Michael.
It's so lovely to see you again.
